>> My name is Shauna Brooks

00:56.400 --> 01:00.133
and I have chipmunk cheeks,
honey, and I hate it.

01:00.133 --> 01:03.200
I'm the first transgendered
urban men's magazine model.

01:03.200 --> 01:05.633
I've done several covers.
Like, I love for people

01:05.633 --> 01:09.100
to look at my body
and be like "wow!"

01:09.100 --> 01:11.533
When I was growing up
I wanted to be a girl.

01:11.533 --> 01:14.200
I don't think I was ever gay.
I see myself as a girl,

01:14.200 --> 01:17.200
so I wouldn't be gay.
My family has always been

01:17.200 --> 01:19.333
supportive, like, everybody
knew that I was different.

01:19.333 --> 01:21.367
Like, girl, Miss Thing,
you saw me sashaying

01:21.367 --> 01:23.667
when I was younger.

01:23.667 --> 01:26.433
I've been in transition
since I was 14 years old.

01:26.433 --> 01:30.133
The first step that I took
into being transgender

01:30.133 --> 01:32.300
was hormone therapy,
which was black market.

01:32.300 --> 01:35.433
Somebody was selling it
and they had those hormone shots

01:35.433 --> 01:39.266
and those pills and you buy it.
From that, it led to silicone

01:39.266 --> 01:42.567
injected in my cheeks,
but as time went on, because

01:42.567 --> 01:45.166
of the free-floating silicone,
it just turned me

01:45.166 --> 01:49.667
into a complete chipmunk.
It was the worst mistake ever.

01:49.667 --> 01:52.233
So then I was like, okay,
I need a mini face-lift

01:52.233 --> 01:55.400
to snatch the muscle back.
I mean literally, like, snatch,

01:55.400 --> 01:57.400
like put your leg in
and snatch it back

01:57.400 --> 02:00.133
and sew me up, like,
that's what I wanted.

02:00.133 --> 02:03.133
But the cheeks
then were lopsided.

02:03.133 --> 02:05.700
So then I'm left with this
lopsided smile,

02:05.700 --> 02:08.333
and these heavy cheeks.
Since my cheeks

02:08.333 --> 02:11.700
are not where I want them to be
it's always a constant battle

02:11.700 --> 02:14.400
with looking at myself
in the mirror and not being

02:14.400 --> 02:15.333
confident.

02:18.066 --> 02:20.300
>> My name is Dana.
I'm 35 years old,

02:20.300 --> 02:23.333
and my breasts look
like collapsed craters.

02:23.333 --> 02:27.266
I grew up in Brooklyn, New York.
In my freshman year my chest

02:27.266 --> 02:30.300
was actually a C cup,
and by the time I was 19, I was,

02:30.300 --> 02:33.300
like, an A or a AA.
They just over time

02:33.300 --> 02:36.266
just get smaller and smaller.
So I had, like, a C cup

02:36.266 --> 02:37.700
for basically two years,
and then somebody came

02:37.700 --> 02:41.166
and took it away from me.
I was like, I'm fixing this.

02:41.166 --> 02:42.734
I mean, who doesn't want
nice boobs?

02:42.734 --> 02:46.033
A few girls that I knew
had gone to this doctor.

02:46.033 --> 02:51.467
I asked for, like, a 34C
and ended up being, like, a 34D.

02:51.467 --> 02:53.734
Before the word "selfie"
even came out, I was just taking

02:53.734 --> 02:56.700
a ton of pictures of myself
'cause I looked--they looked

02:56.700 --> 02:59.734
really, really good.
A few years later,

02:59.734 --> 03:03.567
I wanted to upgrade my implants
from saline to silicone.

03:03.567 --> 03:05.700
So I figured it was a good time
for me to just go in

03:05.700 --> 03:08.700
and give myself
a Valentine's Day present.

03:08.700 --> 03:11.300
So the surgery was, yes,
on Valentine's Day.

03:11.300 --> 03:15.200
After I went home,
my chest started hurting,

03:15.200 --> 03:16.734
and they started feeling
really hard.

03:16.734 --> 03:18.500
So my doctor just said, "Oh, no,
you have to come here

03:18.500 --> 03:20.200
right away."
There's this common thing,

03:20.200 --> 03:22.467
capsular contracture,
that people can develop.

03:22.467 --> 03:25.500
It could be a small to a large
amount of scar tissue

03:25.500 --> 03:30.633
around the actual implants,
and he removed the scar tissue

03:30.633 --> 03:33.333
and then put the silicone
implants back in.

03:33.333 --> 03:35.767
Within a couple months,
it came back.

03:35.767 --> 03:38.200
I believe there probably
should have maybe been drains

03:38.200 --> 03:40.600
or something put in, because I
started developing all this

03:40.600 --> 03:42.500
fluid from removing
the scar tissue.

03:42.500 --> 03:45.467
I went back to see the doctor.
He said to me straight out

03:45.467 --> 03:49.367
to take the implants out,
and I had the implants removed.

03:49.367 --> 03:52.467
And that's where I stand today.
If I were to describe

03:52.467 --> 03:57.767
what my chest looks like,
I have the top of them there,

03:57.767 --> 04:01.233
but the bottom of it's caved in.
This surgery would definitely

04:01.233 --> 04:03.333
give me my life back.
It will make me feel

04:03.333 --> 04:05.200
like who I was.
I am worried if I have

04:05.200 --> 04:08.266
another surgery that it would
happen again, and I don't want

04:08.266 --> 04:10.767
to keep doing this
never-ending boob job.

04:10.767 --> 04:13.133
You know, I had the implants
taken out for a really long time

04:13.133 --> 04:16.300
so I'm hoping I allowed
my body to heal, you know,

04:16.300 --> 04:22.000
this time around because I just
cannot be like this.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.100
>> Well, have you always peed
a lot your whole life?

04:24.100 --> 04:26.100
>> My bladder's
kind of sensitive.

04:26.100 --> 04:28.233
And by the way, every time I
usually go to the bathroom,

04:28.233 --> 04:30.400
you kind of come with me
usually to go pee too.

04:30.400 --> 04:32.767
But you have to go into a stall.
>> I sit when I pee.

04:32.767 --> 04:36.400
>> I go to a urinal,
like most men do.

04:36.400 --> 04:38.633
>> I'm tired.
>> Okay, so what is this about?

04:38.633 --> 04:40.400
Does the next patient
have a bladder problem?

04:40.400 --> 04:44.000
>> The next patient does in fact
not have a bladder problem.

04:44.000 --> 04:48.133
>> Does in fact not have

04:48.133 --> 04:51.166
a bladder problem.
>> We have a very

04:51.166 --> 04:53.000
complicated case.
>> Ugh.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.533
>> This patient's name is Dana.
Look how disabled

04:56.533 --> 04:59.700
her breasts are.
Look at this.

04:59.700 --> 05:03.066
>> Oh, that's not her.
>> That's her.

05:03.066 --> 05:04.700
>> Oh, my God.
>> I know.

05:04.700 --> 05:07.700
>> That beautiful girl has
this problem going on with her?

05:07.700 --> 05:10.166
>> Yeah, she's a breast cripple.
Truly a breast cripple.

05:10.166 --> 05:12.433
>> This is--
>> Look at this.

05:12.433 --> 05:16.433
So let's bring her in,
ask her exactly what's happened,

05:16.433 --> 05:20.000
and see whether we're just gonna
fall into the same trap.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.667
>> Can you please send in Dana?
>> Hi.

05:23.667 --> 05:25.266
>> Dana, hi.
Dr. Nassif.

05:25.266 --> 05:26.667
>> Hi, nice to meet you.
>> Nice to meet you too.

05:26.667 --> 05:28.300
>> Hi, Dana, I'm Terry Dubrow.
Pleasure.

05:28.300 --> 05:29.700
>> Jeanine. Nice to meet you.
>> Hi, Jeanine.

05:29.700 --> 05:31.600
>> Hi, Jeanine, Terry Dubrow.
>> Nice to meet you too.

05:31.600 --> 05:33.066
>> And you are?
>> Like my other half,

05:33.066 --> 05:35.567
my sister.
I'm hoping that Dr. Dubrow

05:35.567 --> 05:39.033
is gonna be able to give me
an idea of finally, like,

05:39.033 --> 05:41.567
why this is
consistently happening.

05:41.567 --> 05:43.166
>> Take us to the beginning.
What happened?

05:43.166 --> 05:45.467
>> All right.
I'm gonna stay very positive,

05:45.467 --> 05:47.700
but I am a little bit afraid
that I'm at the place

05:47.700 --> 05:50.734
where maybe they cannot fix it.
Basically I had saline

05:50.734 --> 05:54.433
implants done.
They were fantastic, perfect.

05:54.433 --> 05:57.633
So then I decided to
basically upgrade to silicone.

05:57.633 --> 05:59.433
That's when all of the major
problems really started

05:59.433 --> 06:01.066
to arise.
>> All right, so what happened?

06:01.066 --> 06:02.734
You had capsular contracture,
then what did they do?

06:02.734 --> 06:05.166
>> He gave me the capsulectomy
and he put the implants

06:05.166 --> 06:07.700
right back in, yes.
>> After the silicone implants,

06:07.700 --> 06:09.600
then you were fine,
and then you started

06:09.600 --> 06:12.200
developing capsular?
>> Yeah, within just

06:12.200 --> 06:14.100
a couple months.
>> Capsular contracture

06:14.100 --> 06:17.400
of the breast is when you have
a capsule around the implant,

06:17.400 --> 06:21.667
it starts to scar, it gets hard,
and starts to move the implant

06:21.667 --> 06:24.000
in a certain direction.
>> So you went from soft,

06:24.000 --> 06:27.633
slightly ripply salines
to capsular contracture

06:27.633 --> 06:29.600
with silicone?
>> Multiple, multiple times.

06:29.600 --> 06:33.400
>> It could actually cause pain.
It obviously causes a physical

06:33.400 --> 06:36.500
deformity of the breast,
and it can actually destroy

06:36.500 --> 06:39.600
the breast and make it look
absolutely horrendous.

06:39.600 --> 06:42.633
>> So what I ended up doing was
going and seeing a doctor

06:42.633 --> 06:44.500
in New Jersey.
>> Yes?

06:44.500 --> 06:47.400
>> And he said to me, basically,
"If you were my wife..."

06:47.400 --> 06:49.367
>> Yeah?
>> "I would tell you to take

06:49.367 --> 06:52.100
these implants out and let
yourself heal for six months."

06:52.100 --> 06:54.100
>> So he took the implants out.
Then what happened?

06:54.100 --> 06:55.700
>> Yes, and I'm here.
>> Oh, that's what you have

06:55.700 --> 06:57.700
right now?
>> Yeah, I had them taken out.

06:57.700 --> 07:00.166
>> There are essentially
two schools of thought

07:00.166 --> 07:03.633
regarding scar tissue formation
after breast implant surgery.

07:03.633 --> 07:06.633
One is you take the implants out
and you put them in

07:06.633 --> 07:09.633
in a relatively short period
of time to prevent the skin

07:09.633 --> 07:11.633
and soft tissue
from contracting down.

07:11.633 --> 07:14.033
The other is that you wait
a longer period of time

07:14.033 --> 07:16.433
to allow the tissue to heal.
>> I was supposed to wait

07:16.433 --> 07:17.767
about six months...
>> Right.

07:17.767 --> 07:20.033
>> To go back and put them
back in, and then I got afraid.

07:20.033 --> 07:23.633
Like, I was kind of scared.
>> Most surgeons now think

07:23.633 --> 07:26.300
it's better to do it sooner
rather than later to prevent

07:26.300 --> 07:29.100
the problem that exactly
Dana has.

07:29.100 --> 07:31.133
What is your goal?
>> I was comfortable

07:31.133 --> 07:34.667
with my body portions
at the 34D I was.

07:34.667 --> 07:36.400
>> You want to be a D again,
huh?

07:36.400 --> 07:38.533
>> As close to normal.
I know they can't be exactly

07:38.533 --> 07:41.066
the way they were to begin with,
but have my normal, like,

07:41.066 --> 07:43.734
attractive,
sexy, feeling-good self back.

07:43.734 --> 07:46.033
>> Yeah, we don't want you
to have white knight syndrome

07:46.033 --> 07:47.567
with us where...
>> No.

07:47.567 --> 07:50.400
>> We ride in on our white
horses--he'd be on a pony,

07:50.400 --> 07:53.033
obviously.
>> I'd ride in on a beautiful

07:53.033 --> 07:56.033
stallion.
A white pony?

07:56.033 --> 08:00.433
Come on, white pony
versus Lebanese stallion.

08:00.433 --> 08:05.333
It's pretty obvious.
>> Okay, so here actually has

08:05.333 --> 08:09.400
pretty decent thickness.
There is some scarring,

08:09.400 --> 08:12.033
but it's not bad.
Okay, there's an area on your

08:12.033 --> 08:14.533
left breast right here
that's actually quite thin,

08:14.533 --> 08:17.300
and it's retracted, and it's
right on top of the bone.

08:17.300 --> 08:22.233
This is a little bit better.
You know, all right.

08:22.233 --> 08:24.767
There's a couple milli--
it's contracted.

08:24.767 --> 08:28.467
I don't know if you're going

08:28.467 --> 08:31.500
to re-encapsulate again.
You had total,

08:31.500 --> 08:34.600
complete scar tissue removals.
The body has to heal

08:34.600 --> 08:36.600
all of that again.
The immune system comes

08:36.600 --> 08:39.066
and as soon as it sees
that implant, it goes, "Now I

08:39.066 --> 08:41.633
thought I was gonna go a simple
repair job, heal a little wound.

08:41.633 --> 08:44.567
In fact, I'm gonna
nuke this whole area,"

08:44.567 --> 08:48.567
and you have been nuked.
>> I feel nuked.

08:48.567 --> 08:53.734
>> The only way I'm comfortable
taking this incredibly

08:53.734 --> 09:00.233
difficult case on is if you
allow me to pick your size.

09:00.233 --> 09:02.600
>> I'm glad Dr. Dubrow's being
very direct with me right now,

09:02.600 --> 09:05.533
'cause I need that.
I mean, it would suck

09:05.533 --> 09:08.233
to be an A.
>> Okay.

I mean, and it came on quick,

10:07.400 --> 10:10.400
like, 35 pounds in, like,
2 months, and it just

10:10.400 --> 10:13.000
kept escalating,
and escalating, and escalating.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.400
At my heaviest weight
was 286 pounds.

10:16.400 --> 10:20.000
After realizing that I needed
to lose a lot of weight,

10:20.000 --> 10:22.200
and then I was like "Okay,
I think this is what you got

10:22.200 --> 10:23.700
to do to be healthy.
I'm gonna eat healthy.

10:23.700 --> 10:27.166
I think I got to go to the gym."
And I lost about 115 pounds.

10:27.166 --> 10:30.333
After the weight loss,
everything looked great,

10:30.333 --> 10:34.166
except the girls.
They were deflated.

10:34.166 --> 10:36.400
They hung.
I joked and called them

10:36.400 --> 10:40.033
milk udders.
They looked hideous,

10:40.033 --> 10:42.700
so I just told myself
that I was gonna get them

10:42.700 --> 10:46.266
eventually fixed.
It was a gift to myself

10:46.266 --> 10:51.667
for the weight loss.
So I received 510cc

10:51.667 --> 10:55.066
saline implants.
I come out of surgery, and we--

10:55.066 --> 10:59.033
I just knew at that moment
something was not right.

10:59.033 --> 11:01.300
This one was really,
really high,

11:01.300 --> 11:06.066
and it was just so swollen,
and this one I was like,

11:06.066 --> 11:08.200
where is it?
It was way down low.

11:08.200 --> 11:11.700
The day after my surgery
I went in to see the doctor.

11:11.700 --> 11:15.033
So that's when I spoke up
and said, "Is this supposed

11:15.033 --> 11:17.700
to be right?"
And I said "This one hurts.

11:17.700 --> 11:20.200
I know it's the day after
surgery, but it's here.

11:20.200 --> 11:23.033
What's going on with this?"
He immediately kind of

11:23.033 --> 11:26.066
just shushed me
and just said

11:26.066 --> 11:28.333
that they need to heal.
He did tell me that I needed

11:28.333 --> 11:31.200
to massage them.
Three weeks later I go back

11:31.200 --> 11:34.300
for my third checkup,
and that's when I had enough.

11:34.300 --> 11:37.300
I said--I spoke up and I said,
"These don't look any better."

11:37.300 --> 11:40.300
And he was telling me
about massaging my breasts,

11:40.300 --> 11:42.467
and he basically was telling me
that I was not doing them

11:42.467 --> 11:46.367
correctly, and that's why they
weren't settling.

11:46.367 --> 11:50.333
I found another doctor
in Birmingham, went to him.

11:50.333 --> 11:53.367
He didn't, to me,
sound confident

11:53.367 --> 11:55.734
in the options that he was
giving me--what he thought

11:55.734 --> 11:58.367
needed to be done.
So, then it just scared me,

11:58.367 --> 12:02.000
so I just put it on hold,
and I just threw myself

12:02.000 --> 12:07.000
into work and training.
Never in a million years

12:07.000 --> 12:09.367
would I have thought or said
that I was gonna be

12:09.367 --> 12:11.767
a body builder.
It just kind of evolved.

12:11.767 --> 12:15.100
In 2014, I won
the state championship,

12:15.100 --> 12:20.066
which was a huge accomplishment.
My situation, because my breasts

12:20.066 --> 12:24.233
are so uneven, to get ready
and to get into a suit,

12:24.233 --> 12:29.400
I have to wear,
as a matter of fact...

12:29.400 --> 12:33.767
these.
I have to take this

12:33.767 --> 12:36.667
with another one,
and maybe even, like, a sock,

12:36.667 --> 12:41.567
and I have to take it
and glue it all into my suit.

12:41.567 --> 12:43.667
And I just don't want
to do that anymore.

with a lift

As I lost the weight, of course,

14:00.367 --> 14:01.633
the breasts--
>> They deflated?

14:01.633 --> 14:03.300
>> They were horrible.
>> Yeah, what'd you tell

>> I went in and I was like,
"I'm just tired of these."

14:07.433 --> 14:09.767
He did a lollipop lift...
>> Yeah?

14:09.767 --> 14:15.300
>> With implants.
So he did 510cc salines.

14:15.300 --> 14:18.166
>> Both sides the same implant?
>> Correct.

14:18.166 --> 14:20.300
>> The reason he says that
is because they're

14:20.300 --> 14:23.333
so dramatically...
>> Right.

14:23.333 --> 14:26.066
>> Different now.
I don't--I can't even wrap my

14:26.066 --> 14:28.200
brain around what happened,
so I'm dying to know.

14:28.200 --> 14:31.166
>> And neither can I,
because this one was so swollen,

14:31.166 --> 14:33.000
and it was way up here,
and I'm not gonna lie,

14:33.000 --> 14:35.200
kind of looked a little good.
I kind of liked the cleavage.

14:35.200 --> 14:39.200
It was up here, though,
and this one was so low.

14:39.200 --> 14:40.467
>> They looked this way
immediately?

14:40.467 --> 14:43.000
>> Like, yeah, it was already
like that, and he said,

14:43.000 --> 14:45.467
"No problem."
He said, "This one's gonna drop.

14:45.467 --> 14:47.600
This one's gonna raise."
>> Oh, yeah!

14:47.600 --> 14:49.266
>> "It's gonna take time.
You need to massage them.

14:49.266 --> 14:52.734
Massage, massage, massage them."
>> How long after the surgery

14:52.734 --> 14:57.233
did the right one get hard?
>> Uh, a few weeks.

14:57.233 --> 15:00.367
I mean it got hard pretty quick.
>> I suspect what you had was

15:00.367 --> 15:02.233
you had a hematoma
in your right breast,

15:02.233 --> 15:06.000
which is a collection of blood.
One of the most common reasons

15:06.000 --> 15:09.266
you get an early encapsulation
is when you have bleeding

15:09.266 --> 15:12.233
inside of a breast pocket
after breast augmentation.

15:12.233 --> 15:15.300
A hematoma will often be
turned into scar tissue by the

15:15.300 --> 15:18.400
immune system as a response
to the inflammation.

15:18.400 --> 15:21.233
So, let's go take a look
and see what's going on,

15:21.233 --> 15:23.400
and we'll best figure out
the options based on the

15:23.400 --> 15:25.400
physical exam, okay?
Melissa's case is

15:25.400 --> 15:28.233
very interesting.
She has two very different

15:28.233 --> 15:31.500
breasts that will require two
completely different treatments.

15:31.500 --> 15:34.567
Symmetry is going to be
extraordinarily difficult

15:34.567 --> 15:38.133
to achieve because of the
different treatments required.

15:38.133 --> 15:40.033
Okay...
>> Hello.

15:40.033 --> 15:42.533
>> First of all,
look at these guns.

15:42.533 --> 15:45.433
>> Yeah, they're bigger
than both of us.

15:45.433 --> 15:47.100
>> Wow.
>> Yeah, don't mess with her.

15:47.100 --> 15:49.033
>> Whoa, look at that.
>> Don't make her mad.

15:49.033 --> 15:52.367
>> No doubt Melissa can bench
more than I can, especially

15:52.367 --> 15:54.667
a lot more than Terry.
>> Let's check this out.

15:54.667 --> 15:57.400
>> Okay.
>> Okay, so this side

15:57.400 --> 16:00.533
is encapsulated.
There are four grades

16:00.533 --> 16:02.433
of encapsulation.
Grade one is minimal,

16:02.433 --> 16:06.000
grade four is the most severe.
This is the most severe.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.533
This is a rock.
'Cause this side is

16:07.533 --> 16:10.133
completely soft.
This is a grade one--this is

16:10.133 --> 16:14.266
a grade four encapsulation,
so they need completely

16:14.266 --> 16:17.600
different operations.
The operation required here

16:17.600 --> 16:20.133
is to take the implant out
and the scar tissue,

16:20.133 --> 16:23.533
and find a way of filling out
the scarified lower pole.

16:23.533 --> 16:26.533
The operation that needs to be
done here is take the implant

16:26.533 --> 16:30.166
out and tighten up the too-low
pocket, and remove a whole bunch

16:30.166 --> 16:33.400
of skin.
Exactly the opposite things

16:33.400 --> 16:36.600
are done.
So, you have options.

16:36.600 --> 16:39.567
>> Okay.
>> This is one of those cases

16:39.567 --> 16:43.100
that revision specialists
kind of live for.

16:43.100 --> 16:46.700
Tennis players and athletes want
to play the toughest opponents.

16:46.700 --> 16:50.300
This is a pretty tough opponent.
You know, I kind of want

16:50.300 --> 16:52.500
to play this, you know?
>> Okay, awesome.

16:52.500 --> 16:54.467
>> I kind of do,
and I want to help you.

16:54.467 --> 16:59.100
So, let's go for it, yeah?
>> Yes.

16:59.100 --> 17:00.367
>> New boobs!
>> Yay!

17:00.367 --> 17:02.033
>> Here we go.

Thank you.

>> There's just scar everywhere.
>> And she wants to be how big?

17:12.233 --> 17:14.767

whether I can even

17:14.767 --> 17:17.633
make her a breast.
>> The problem with what we did

17:17.633 --> 17:20.633
now, we've kind of unleashed
that silicone, so you'll never

17:20.633 --> 17:23.166

20:06.734 --> 20:09.467
your body's gonna go, "Ha!
You again!"

20:09.467 --> 20:11.367
>> Yeah, right.
>> I'll put an implant in

20:11.367 --> 20:15.367
that fits very comfortably,
and then I'm gonna go away.

20:15.367 --> 20:17.467
>> I feel confident.
>> Dana's chance of having

20:17.467 --> 20:20.100
a capsular contracture again
is extraordinarily high,

20:20.100 --> 20:23.333
so I want to make sure
I do something that's different.

20:23.333 --> 20:26.066
My hope is that I can
meet Dana's expectations

20:26.066 --> 20:29.000
and give her the volume and the
size she wants, but her body

20:29.000 --> 20:32.734
holds all the cards,
and her body and the scar tissue

20:32.734 --> 20:36.734
in the pocket will determine
what I can safely put in there.

20:36.734 --> 20:39.500
For Dana's surgery today,
I'll start by making an incision

20:39.500 --> 20:42.533
under her areolas before lifting
the scar tissue off the lower

20:42.533 --> 20:45.333
poles of the breast
from the ribcage.

20:45.333 --> 20:48.000
I'll then reshape
the breast pocket and place new,

20:48.000 --> 20:51.100
appropriately sized implants,
giving Dana normal-looking

20:51.100 --> 20:55.667
breasts.
Okay, first thing I see

20:55.667 --> 21:01.367
is just scar everywhere.
It won't conform

21:01.367 --> 21:03.433
to the shape of an implant.

21:06.100 --> 21:09.100
>> And she wants to be how big?
>> Forget size.

21:09.100 --> 21:12.367
This is about whether I can
even make her a breast.

21:12.367 --> 21:14.767
In Dana's case,
all of her breast tissue

21:14.767 --> 21:17.400
has been essentially
replaced by scar.

21:17.400 --> 21:19.633
So, you essentially have
to make a pocket

21:19.633 --> 21:22.667
in the middle
of a block of scar.

21:22.667 --> 21:26.367
So, the little hairs on the back
of my neck are standing up

21:26.367 --> 21:30.133
because I'm concerned this
may not be fixable.

21:30.133 --> 21:35.033
So, let's test out
a real silicone sizer.

21:35.033 --> 21:40.000
This is a 300.
In a weird way, we need bigger.

21:40.000 --> 21:43.033
Can I see a 400?
Thank you.

21:43.033 --> 21:44.700
>> Maybe her body will
accept this one.

21:44.700 --> 21:46.400
>> Maybe.
We're trying to get from

21:46.400 --> 21:49.000
"doesn't suck" to...
>> "Okay."

21:49.000 --> 21:51.700
>> To "okay" right now.
Let's sit this one up

21:51.700 --> 21:55.300
and just see if we have
any kind of real shape or not.

21:55.300 --> 21:57.233
Ugh.

22:05.000 --> 22:08.033
>> Ooh.
>> That is--

22:08.033 --> 22:09.533
look at that.
Have you ever seen that?

22:09.533 --> 22:11.333
>> Ew.
>> Have you ever seen that?

22:11.333 --> 22:12.266
>> No.

22:17.700 --> 22:23.033
>> ♪ I want to be perfect ♪
>> That's just not good.

22:23.033 --> 22:24.600
Okay, down.

22:24.600 --> 22:27.300
Yeah, not acceptable.
I'm used to the breasts

22:27.300 --> 22:29.700
not looking very acceptable
in a difficult

22:29.700 --> 22:33.166
revisional situation,
but in the back of my mind,

22:33.166 --> 22:36.300
I know that with Dana's case
I'm dealing with pure scar

22:36.300 --> 22:40.700
and not usual breast tissue.
This is a risky move.

22:40.700 --> 22:42.633
>> That did something.
>> That did something?

22:42.633 --> 22:44.633
I hope so--wait, there's one
more right here.

22:44.633 --> 22:48.033
What I have to do is go in
and very carefully

22:48.033 --> 22:52.734
and judiciously incise the scar
so as to try to manipulate

22:52.734 --> 22:57.066
and shape the breast envelope
without going too superficial

22:57.066 --> 22:59.500
and getting through the skin.
Okay, so the right one,

22:59.500 --> 23:02.600
I'm very optimistic.
The left one is much more

23:02.600 --> 23:06.000
complicated because it's
much more disfigured.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.667
Wow, it's like
a rock quarry in here.

23:08.667 --> 23:12.734
Whoa.
Got a massive bleeder in here.

23:12.734 --> 23:15.467
.
Wow, I've seen bleeding before--

23:15.467 --> 23:18.200
this is bleeding.
.

23:18.200 --> 23:21.233
Hold.
Hey, Katie, would you come wipe

23:21.233 --> 23:24.767
the blood off my glasses?
It's not particularly uncommon

23:24.767 --> 23:28.500
to hit a large arterial bleeder
during a difficult

23:28.500 --> 23:31.233
breast revision case.
It doesn't usually spray you

23:31.233 --> 23:33.734
directly in the face.
So this one goes

23:33.734 --> 23:37.100
in the left breast.
Okay, that fits okay.

23:37.100 --> 23:40.233

hormone therapy.

>> Yeah, at 14.
Anyways, in the black,

25:52.667 --> 25:55.767
urban community,
the transgenders get silicone

25:55.767 --> 25:59.066
pumped in their cheeks,
in their breasts, in their ass.

25:59.066 --> 26:03.734
>> Injecting anything permanent
into any part of your body

26:03.734 --> 26:05.734
is a bad thing.
Injecting silicone

26:05.734 --> 26:09.100
destroys the underlying tissue
by causing a severe

26:09.100 --> 26:11.266
inflammatory response
and it becomes

26:11.266 --> 26:14.767
a chronic problem.
>> So then I learned

26:14.767 --> 26:17.734
about facial feminization.
I wanted to do it here

26:17.734 --> 26:20.233
in America,
and when I told the doctors

26:20.233 --> 26:22.233
I had silicone
in my face, he was like, "No."

26:22.233 --> 26:24.266
That's when I went to Thailand,
and the doctor said,

26:24.266 --> 26:26.667
"I will saw your cheekbone."
>> Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

26:26.667 --> 26:28.567
>> Another dangerous procedure.
>> That's dangerous?

26:28.567 --> 26:31.300
>> Yeah.
There are so many good plastic

26:31.300 --> 26:34.667
surgeons in this country,
and medicine generally is

26:34.667 --> 26:38.133
the safest that it can be
anywhere in the world,

26:38.133 --> 26:41.367
so you should never go
outside of the United States

26:41.367 --> 26:44.533
for any surgical procedure.
>> As the year went on,

26:44.533 --> 26:49.033
this right cheek
just would not stop.

26:49.033 --> 26:50.633
>> So it's just the right cheek
that's bothering you?

26:50.633 --> 26:52.100
>> Just the right.
>> You think it's

26:52.100 --> 26:53.367
a little bit too big?
>> I think it's too big.

26:53.367 --> 26:55.000
When I smile, I think it's
just too big.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.266
>> Okay, we see that.
>> You see?

26:56.266 --> 26:59.100
>> But I told her, "What if you
do surgery with the cheeks

26:59.100 --> 27:01.133
and you make
a even more big problem?"

27:01.133 --> 27:03.133
>> Good point.
>> That's always our--

27:03.133 --> 27:06.266
the consideration we have.
>> Constant injection

27:06.266 --> 27:10.200
and modification of her cheeks
with silicone--it's dangerous.

27:10.200 --> 27:13.734
>> We always wonder,
at what cost if we go in there?

27:13.734 --> 27:17.266
There's a hole here right
through the bone of the skull

27:17.266 --> 27:20.133
where important
sensory nerve comes out.

27:20.133 --> 27:23.266
If you bugger up that nerve,
you can't move and you're like--

27:23.266 --> 27:24.700
>> The nerves are dead?
>> Those are just done.

27:24.700 --> 27:26.200
>> Dead, and there's no
going back.

27:26.200 --> 27:28.533
>> And you're not afraid
to have your cheek operated on?

27:28.533 --> 27:30.200
>> No, absolutely not.
>> One of those things we'll

27:30.200 --> 27:31.667

in the exam room.

27:31.667 --> 27:33.266

We're in the middle

You don't do that.
There is that indurated tissue

28:37.633 --> 28:40.200
right in this area right here.
>> See, that's the thing.

28:40.200 --> 28:43.266
When you have silicone
injected, your body can form

28:43.266 --> 28:47.100
a foreign body reaction.
Sometimes these silicone

28:47.100 --> 28:49.266
granulomas can be removed
very easily.

28:49.266 --> 28:51.233
>> Okay.
>> In your situation,

28:51.233 --> 28:54.233
when they're sort of diffusely
distributed in the tissue...

28:54.233 --> 28:56.233
>> Right. Right.
>> They're much more difficult

28:56.233 --> 28:59.233
to take out.
>> There are numerous risks

28:59.233 --> 29:01.734
associated with going in
and trying to carve down

29:01.734 --> 29:05.000
some of Shauna's silicone
in her face such as damage

29:05.000 --> 29:07.333
to one of the facial nerves.
So that's why you have

29:07.333 --> 29:09.767
to be careful.
Yes, your right cheek

29:09.767 --> 29:11.433
is a little bit bigger.
Let's say we're in there

29:11.433 --> 29:13.367
and we're dissecting it.
Problem with what we did,

29:13.367 --> 29:16.266
now we've kind of unleashed
that silicone sometimes where

29:16.266 --> 29:19.000
it can actually become infected.
Then you ruin--you'll never be

29:19.000 --> 29:21.500
symmetric again.
>> When the two best doctors

29:21.500 --> 29:25.100
in Hollywood are saying
it's like, "Wow, that's tough.

29:25.100 --> 29:27.367
That's serious.
That's risky,"

29:27.367 --> 29:29.433
I'm not gonna take that risk.
>> I don't think there's

29:29.433 --> 29:32.400
a surgical solution.
The other option is

29:32.400 --> 29:35.767
to inject anti-inflammatory
in the form of a steroid

29:35.767 --> 29:38.367
or cortisone which would have
very little risk,

29:38.367 --> 29:41.500
because, let's face it,
a little bit less swelling

29:41.500 --> 29:43.100
and you'd be there, right?
>> Yeah.

29:43.100 --> 29:44.367
>> Just a little.
>> Yeah.

29:44.367 --> 29:49.133
>> So to do very aggressive
surgery to attack

29:49.133 --> 29:52.300
a little bit of an improvement
to get where you want to be

I make the off-season Melissa
happy as well as the

31:40.200 --> 31:43.233
on
It's a very challenging,

31:43.233 --> 31:46.333
difficult situation,
and I sort of probably will go

31:46.333 --> 31:48.500
somewhere in the middle.
I will begin

31:48.500 --> 31:51.367
Melissa's surgery today
by making an incision around

31:51.367 --> 31:54.200
the areolas.
Then I will enter into Melissa's

31:54.200 --> 31:57.133
right pocket,
remove the implant and remove

31:57.133 --> 32:00.500
all capsulized scar tissue.
On the left side I will

32:00.500 --> 32:03.633
remove the implant, create a
smaller pocket, and place it

32:03.633 --> 32:06.367
to a higher position
to match the right breast.

32:06.367 --> 32:09.400
Finally, I will place a new pair
of implants into the pockets,

32:09.400 --> 32:11.500
which will hopefully
give Melissa the large,

32:11.500 --> 32:14.367
symmetrical breasts she's waited
so long for.

32:14.367 --> 32:16.500
So let's go ahead and open up
the right side and see how much

32:16.500 --> 32:21.767
scar tissue is in there.

32:21.767 --> 32:24.300
Look at that icky fluid
all over me.

32:24.300 --> 32:26.533
You see that?
>> Yeah, that's--I haven't

32:26.533 --> 32:29.233
seen--that's nasty.
>> As I open up Melissa's

32:29.233 --> 32:32.700
right breast pocket,
a dark, icky fluid comes out,

32:32.700 --> 32:36.500
shooting everywhere.
I thought maybe a hematoma had

32:36.500 --> 32:40.533
caused the early encapsulation,
but this brown fluid

32:40.533 --> 32:43.533
everywhere--I don't know.
There's something definitely

32:43.533 --> 32:47.133
different going on here.
Look at that.

32:47.133 --> 32:49.266
>> Ooh.
>> That is--

32:49.266 --> 32:51.166
>> Ooh.
>> Look at that.

32:51.166 --> 32:52.533
Have you ever seen that?
>> No.

32:52.533 --> 32:54.166
>> Ew.
>> Have you ever seen that?

32:54.166 --> 32:55.567
>> No.
>> I've probably done over

32:55.567 --> 32:59.400
10,000 cases of breast surgery.
I've never seen that before.

32:59.400 --> 33:02.166
It's pretty clear that Melissa's
implant has ruptured.

33:02.166 --> 33:06.000
Normally, when a saline implant
ruptures, it is absorbed

33:06.000 --> 33:08.567
into the body, and you see
no evidence of saline.

33:08.567 --> 33:12.600
The fact that there's this
dark brown, granular fluid

33:12.600 --> 33:18.300
indicates it could be old blood
that's mixed with the saline

33:18.300 --> 33:20.300
that's in the lower portion
of the bag.

33:20.300 --> 33:24.367
It's really strange.
She had a ruptured saline

33:24.367 --> 33:27.433
implant that didn't absorb.
That means her scar tissue is

33:27.433 --> 33:31.433
so thick that it wouldn't
allow absorption of the saline.

33:31.433 --> 33:35.100
Look how thick that capsule is.
That's thicker than a normal

33:35.100 --> 33:38.333
pectoralis major muscle.
Normally when a saline

33:38.333 --> 33:41.633
implant ruptures, the body
rapidly absorbs the saline,

33:41.633 --> 33:45.433
and no problems occur.
In Melissa's case,

33:45.433 --> 33:48.600
because of this brown, granular
fluid, it obviously incited

33:48.600 --> 33:51.467
an inflammatory reaction,
and you can tell that

33:51.467 --> 33:54.633
by the thickness
and the inflammatory appearance

33:54.633 --> 33:58.300
of the scar tissue
that I'm finding in here.

33:58.300 --> 34:01.500
This is an extra-full
560cc implant,

34:01.500 --> 34:03.734
which is about
a shot glass larger

34:03.734 --> 34:06.367
than her old implants.
On the left side we'll put

34:06.367 --> 34:11.100
another 560cc smooth,
extra-full profile,

34:11.100 --> 34:13.500
which means more projection.
The question is, of course,

34:13.500 --> 34:16.000
what will happen
when she loses 30 pounds

34:16.000 --> 34:17.467

for a competition?

34:17.467 --> 34:20.533

I'll admit it, right now Dana's
breasts look kind of perfect,

39:50.734 --> 39:52.767
>> Absolutely, absolutely.
>> Yeah, day one first,

39:52.767 --> 39:54.467
you know?
>> This is actually

39:54.467 --> 39:56.600
gonna be day one.
>> I have never seen Melissa

39:56.600 --> 39:58.600
this happy.
Dr. Dubrow did such an awesome

39:58.600 --> 40:00.266
job--he knocked it
out of the park.

40:00.266 --> 40:02.266
>> And, you know, it's gonna be
so awesome this time.

40:02.266 --> 40:05.400
We don't have to go through
the whole thing with the gluing.

40:05.400 --> 40:09.000
>> Oh, my gosh, the glue!
>> And suits not fitting

40:09.000 --> 40:11.133
and so on.
I mean it's gonna be so awesome.

40:11.133 --> 40:14.467
Before my surgery, my breasts
were totally uneven.

40:14.467 --> 40:17.667
The right one was really high
and hard as a rock, the left one

40:17.667 --> 40:21.133
very low and droopy.
It was disheartening to know

40:21.133 --> 40:24.133
that I could not achieve
my full potential

40:24.133 --> 40:27.133
in the industry
because of my breasts.

40:27.133 --> 40:29.633
The unevenness was such
a challenge to hide.

40:29.633 --> 40:31.667
Now, after my surgery,
my breasts are even

40:31.667 --> 40:33.767
and symmetrical.
This operation

40:33.767 --> 40:36.767
has truly changed my life,
and it feels amazing.

40:36.767 --> 40:38.533
>> Do a pose.
>> Do a little pose?

40:38.533 --> 40:40.633
>> Yeah, yeah, there you go.
Look at you.

40:40.633 --> 40:43.400
Oh, my gosh, no, awesome.
>> You ready to work out?

40:43.400 --> 40:44.633
>> Let's go.
Let's go.

40:44.633 --> 40:50.100
>> All right, come on.

you know, every morning
I wake up I'm not gonna find it.

42:08.200 --> 42:09.700
That there's not gonna be
the start of something

42:09.700 --> 42:11.734
that's gonna be, like,
a red flag or, you know,

42:11.734 --> 42:15.767
an uh-oh moment--I feel like
it's just gonna be good

42:15.767 --> 42:17.500

Everything I was portraying
as being, you know,

42:39.467 --> 42:41.734
secure and confident,
I wasn't actually

42:41.734 --> 42:44.533
feeling that inside.
My breasts now look full,

42:44.533 --> 42:47.633
healthy, vibrant.
I'm confident.

were not dropping.

this thing is.

The chance you're gonna lose
