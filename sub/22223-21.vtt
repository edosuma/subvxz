WEBVTT

00:02.795 --> 00:04.296
What about Scorpius?
-What about him?

00:04.380 --> 00:06.245
Well, he might have
been captured.

00:07.300 --> 00:08.039
Harvey.

00:08.134 --> 00:10.295
You must go back for him.

00:10.386 --> 00:13.423
Aeryn:
We're going to walk into the
most heavily guarded base in the Scarran Empire,

00:13.514 --> 00:16.176
start a civil war and
walk outwith Scorpius.

00:16.267 --> 00:17.473
What part of that do you
not understand?

00:17.560 --> 00:20.347
Why shouldn't I just have
you seized right now?

00:20.438 --> 00:22.394
Well, maybe this.

00:22.481 --> 00:23.982
A fission bomb.

00:24.066 --> 00:26.193
My heart stops, we all go boom.

00:26.277 --> 00:27.437
He's crazy.

00:27.528 --> 00:28.859
Isn't it fun?

00:28.946 --> 00:31.688
What am I offered for all the
powers of the universe?

00:31.782 --> 00:37.322
Give us wormhole weapons
and everyone will be safe.

00:37.413 --> 00:41.156
Have you got anything to offer,
or is all this just an
elaborate bluff?

00:41.250 --> 00:44.413
You don't believe that I
can control wormholes?

00:44.503 --> 00:48.712
An entire cavern just to grow
the flowers they eat. Why?

00:48.799 --> 00:50.630
I'm going to capture your soul.

00:50.718 --> 00:52.754
Scorpius can't possibly
hold out much longer.

00:52.845 --> 00:53.800
Rygel?

00:53.888 --> 00:56.254
The Scarrans will never
make you rich.

00:56.349 --> 01:00.058
How much hatred exists here
between the Charrids
and the Kalish?

01:00.144 --> 01:01.554
Where the hell is my riot?

01:01.646 --> 01:04.513
I will not be humiliated
by you, Vakali.

01:07.652 --> 01:09.188
Will you betray me?

01:09.278 --> 01:12.236
I've served you for
ten cycles as a spy.

01:12.323 --> 01:15.156
Don't fire or you'll
detonate the bomb.

01:18.412 --> 01:20.198
You stupid son of a bitch!

01:20.289 --> 01:21.825
I'm sorry, John.

01:21.916 --> 01:24.373
And now on Farscape.

01:24.460 --> 01:26.325
(yells)

01:26.420 --> 01:28.331
Scorpius:
You do not know what
you're doing.

01:28.422 --> 01:32.586
Yeah, I do and I'm gonna
freakin' nuke you and half
of this damn base.

01:33.302 --> 01:34.678
Scorpius:
Kill me later.

01:34.762 --> 01:37.925
I should kill you now.
You're still my prisoner.

01:38.015 --> 01:40.267
Technically he's my prisoner.
-Thank you, John.

01:40.351 --> 01:41.841
When Aeryn wakes up,
she gonna kill him!

01:41.936 --> 01:46.179
Staleek:
I'm so pleased to see
you're all safe.

01:47.692 --> 01:52.982
Minister Ahkna's forces have
done a superb job in
quelling the unrest.

01:53.072 --> 01:56.485
A duty to which I'm sure
she's eager to return.

01:59.996 --> 02:02.032
See ya later, sweetheart.

02:09.338 --> 02:10.999
Thank you.

02:12.967 --> 02:14.457
Aeryn. Shh.

02:14.552 --> 02:17.134
Did we win?

02:17.221 --> 02:22.341
You'll be delighted to hear my
guards were able to secure the
rest of your crew as well.

02:22.435 --> 02:25.768
Coincidentally, as they were
also nearing exits.

02:25.855 --> 02:29.643
Like yourselves, I'm sure they
were simply trying to avoid

02:29.734 --> 02:33.397
any entanglement in violence.
-Where are they?

02:33.487 --> 02:37.696
There are guards placed to
ensure their wellbeing.

02:37.783 --> 02:40.240
( beeping )

02:40.328 --> 02:43.320
Were you planning to leave?
-Temporarily.

02:43.414 --> 02:46.406
Grayza called with another
offer. But you had a
riot going on.

02:46.500 --> 02:49.207
We didn't wanna bother you.
We decided to take our own car.

02:51.339 --> 02:53.921
I'm glad you didn't.

02:54.008 --> 02:57.171
Base defenses have been
placed on highest alert.

02:57.261 --> 03:02.881
Any non-Scarran vessels will
automatically be targeted
and destroyed.

03:02.975 --> 03:05.682
We were very lucky.

03:05.770 --> 03:07.852
We'll transport you
to the Carrier.

03:07.938 --> 03:09.144
That's very kind.

03:09.231 --> 03:11.938
My pleasure... John.

03:17.073 --> 03:20.611
Jenek:
Emperor, the craft is an
Eradicator, Topraktin design.

03:20.701 --> 03:23.989
We've gained entry and
neutralized its systems.

03:24.080 --> 03:27.914
Sentinels are now securing the
star charts and the vector logs.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.207
Leave no trace when
you've completed.

03:30.294 --> 03:33.957
I don't want them to know
what we know.
-Sir.

03:34.048 --> 03:36.960
l prevented you from leaving
for your own protection.

03:37.051 --> 03:39.087
You what?
-You stopped us from leaving?

03:39.178 --> 03:40.918
You stuck a knife in our back.

03:41.013 --> 03:43.299
No.

03:43.391 --> 03:45.006
Your plan would have failed.

03:45.101 --> 03:47.934
We could have be on
Lo'La by now...
-Hear him out. Hear him out!

03:48.020 --> 03:51.933
It is quite likely the
Scarrans had already
disabled D'Argo's ship.

03:52.024 --> 03:53.309
That's impossible.

03:53.401 --> 03:55.141
And found Moya.

03:55.236 --> 03:57.477
Even if we manage to
get off Katratzi,

03:57.571 --> 03:59.778
their base's weapons would
have destroyed us.

03:59.865 --> 04:01.480
Stealth is no longer an option.

04:01.575 --> 04:04.738
Does Lo'La have enough
firepower to blast us out?

04:04.829 --> 04:07.320
Maybe.

04:07.415 --> 04:09.451
Probably. I don't know.
It's worth a shot.

04:09.542 --> 04:11.578
Aeryn:
How would we do it?

04:11.669 --> 04:15.036
I'd call Lo'La, she'd blast a
hole and we'd run through.

04:15.131 --> 04:17.167
Crichton:
Do it before someone
else screws us.

04:17.258 --> 04:19.214
Okay.

04:19.301 --> 04:21.166
(speaks Luxan )

04:26.725 --> 04:29.262
( repeats Luxan words )

04:31.105 --> 04:32.766
Somebody's jammed the Comms.

04:32.857 --> 04:34.643
No, no, the Comms are
working fine.

04:34.733 --> 04:36.394
They must have disabled Lo'La.

04:36.485 --> 04:38.225
That is impossible.

04:38.320 --> 04:40.106
Hey, what about the
Command Carrier?

04:40.197 --> 04:41.607
Can we still get a
free ride outta here?

04:41.699 --> 04:44.657
Ahkna:
Try it and find out.

04:44.743 --> 04:46.483
We don't know what you're
talking about.

04:46.579 --> 04:49.742
Oh, let me enlighten you.

04:49.832 --> 04:52.244
Grayza doesn't frighten me.

04:52.334 --> 04:55.121
Her Command Carrier doesn't
frighten me.

04:55.212 --> 04:58.500
Your bomb doesn't frighten me

04:58.591 --> 05:00.252
and neither do you.

05:00.342 --> 05:04.381
Damn. I'm on the brink of
devastation, Minnie Pearl.

05:07.308 --> 05:09.014
( beeping )

05:10.728 --> 05:15.017
Perhaps we should go
there together.

05:22.490 --> 05:26.403
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut.

05:26.494 --> 05:30.237
Three years ago I got shot
through a wormhole.

05:30.331 --> 05:32.117
I'm in a distant part
of the universe

05:32.208 --> 05:35.166
aboard this living ship of
escaped prisoners,

05:35.252 --> 05:37.243
my friends.

05:38.339 --> 05:40.125
I've made enemies.

05:40.216 --> 05:43.208
Powerful, dangerous.

05:43.302 --> 05:47.045
Now all I want is to
find a way home

05:47.139 --> 05:49.881
to warn Earth.

05:49.975 --> 05:55.095
Look upward and share
the wonders I've seen.

06:30.391 --> 06:33.474
(alien announcement
over P.A. )

06:33.561 --> 06:36.052
1812, this room bug free?

06:36.146 --> 06:37.181
(1812 chirps)

06:37.273 --> 06:38.513
Good boy.

06:46.282 --> 06:49.319
Okay, convince me.

06:50.327 --> 06:52.192
Crystherium Utilia.

06:54.081 --> 06:55.321
The flower.

06:55.416 --> 06:57.702
Yes. Very important.

06:57.793 --> 07:01.081
Oh. It'd better be.

07:01.171 --> 07:04.163
Is that why they're growning
it in the Bat Cave?

07:04.258 --> 07:06.123
That's right.
You've been there?

07:06.218 --> 07:08.004
Listen up, Grasshopper.

07:08.095 --> 07:12.008
I finally have a plan that
works. It's simple.

07:12.099 --> 07:14.215
We get in, we break bread.

07:14.310 --> 07:16.141
We see the sights, we grab you,
we get out.

07:16.228 --> 07:18.059
And now you're gonna throw
flowers at me?

07:18.147 --> 07:21.355
We need to destroy
the Crystherium.

07:24.653 --> 07:26.814
Flowers trump wormholes?

07:26.905 --> 07:28.770
At the moment, yes.

07:34.330 --> 07:37.242
What have I told you about
smoking in my head?!

07:38.792 --> 07:40.328
Hey.
-Sit down!

07:40.419 --> 07:41.704
lain't sayin' nothin'. You...

07:41.795 --> 07:44.286
Sit down!
-He's the boss.

07:44.381 --> 07:46.042
I'm talking to you.

07:46.592 --> 07:47.297
Flowers.

07:47.384 --> 07:48.885
( scoffs )

07:48.969 --> 07:52.177
The number one secret in the
whole Scarran Empire.

07:52.264 --> 07:56.724
Ha. Even the Charrids and Kalish
haven't figured its real deal.

07:56.810 --> 07:59.187
Stark used to live
here on Katratzi,

07:59.271 --> 08:02.308
assisting the leadership caste
with their death rituals.

08:02.399 --> 08:04.355
My side, you're side!
My side, you're side!

08:04.443 --> 08:06.525
Frell me again!

08:06.612 --> 08:09.228
That why you were torturing
him when I met you?

08:09.323 --> 08:11.109
That's right.

08:11.200 --> 08:16.285
Crystherium growth requires
very specific and
rare conditions.

08:16.372 --> 08:22.242
The Scarrans can only propel
their power forward from
these few locations.

08:22.336 --> 08:26.295
And destroying a bunch of
flowers is supposed to
set 'em back?

08:26.382 --> 08:28.247
For hundreds of cycles.

08:29.343 --> 08:30.799
Why?

08:31.887 --> 08:33.252
'Cause the need 'em.

08:33.347 --> 08:34.678
Scarrans.

08:34.765 --> 08:36.756
Simplistic, brutish creatures.

08:36.850 --> 08:39.842
Should have died out
generations ago.

08:39.937 --> 08:41.427
What happens if they
eat the flower?

08:41.522 --> 08:44.480
Big brains. Evolutionarily
competitive.

08:44.566 --> 08:46.557
Hey, you know, Staleek, Ahkna.

08:46.652 --> 08:48.233
And if they don't eat 'em?

08:48.320 --> 08:51.733
Your dog could beat 'em at
checkers! Ha!

08:52.741 --> 08:53.776
Hey!

08:53.867 --> 08:55.607
Though Stark provided
many details,

08:55.703 --> 08:58.536
l was unable to learn of
Katratzi's location.

08:58.622 --> 09:03.412
You rescued him prior to
that breakthrough.

09:03.502 --> 09:05.663
Sorry to stitch you up.

09:05.754 --> 09:07.130
No, you're not.

09:07.214 --> 09:10.331
You were taking too long with
the wormholes, John.

09:10.426 --> 09:13.384
Reality provides opportunity.

09:13.470 --> 09:17.054
I needed some way to hurt
the Scarrans. Now.

09:17.141 --> 09:19.348
You know, you're not...
you're not making any sense.

09:19.435 --> 09:21.972
You... you take the knowledge
from my head,

09:22.062 --> 09:25.304
and then you tell me that
you give it to him...

09:25.399 --> 09:27.185
what, so I'm gonna rescue him?

09:27.276 --> 09:30.814
l have no wormhole
knowledge, John.

09:32.030 --> 09:33.281
But Harvey said...

09:33.365 --> 09:35.401
Scorpius knows everything
you know.

09:35.492 --> 09:37.232
So what, I lied.

09:37.327 --> 09:38.828
Harvey?

09:38.912 --> 09:41.369
Oh, that is clever.

09:43.917 --> 09:46.203
We had a deal.

09:46.295 --> 09:49.253
I help you rescue Aeryn Sun
from the Scarrans,

09:49.339 --> 09:51.716
you give me wormholes.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.586
Boss says lay low!

09:53.677 --> 09:56.760
Don't go near him anymore.
Give him some peace.

09:56.847 --> 09:59.634
But obviously you betrayed
our contract, yes?

09:59.725 --> 10:01.215
But you know what?

10:01.310 --> 10:04.052
You went and left him
behind to die.

10:04.146 --> 10:06.933
You had no intention of
returning for my rescue,
did you?

10:07.024 --> 10:08.889
Fail-safe.

10:08.984 --> 10:13.353
You screw the boss, I find a
way to get you reinterested.

10:14.281 --> 10:15.987
You trying to lay this
off on me?

10:16.074 --> 10:19.783
You see, if my Neural Clone
has returned,

10:19.870 --> 10:23.954
it is only because you have
betrayed me.

10:24.041 --> 10:26.157
You trying to say Harvey's
back because of me?

10:26.251 --> 10:28.242
You should honor your
contracts, John.

10:28.337 --> 10:30.749
No. No contract.

10:30.839 --> 10:32.124
You betrayed us.

10:32.216 --> 10:33.080
We had a deal.

10:33.175 --> 10:35.336
No. He screwed us!

10:35.427 --> 10:38.134
And now you get on your high
horse. We had a deal.

10:38.222 --> 10:40.178
Hey, you took a bribe.

10:40.265 --> 10:43.098
You bank the cut but when
the heat's on,

10:43.185 --> 10:47.349
you're just another dumb copper
doing his job. Unbelievable!

10:49.983 --> 10:51.564
Hey!

10:51.652 --> 10:54.064
Look at these little beauties.

10:54.154 --> 10:57.021
Would you have left me to
perish with the Scarrans?

10:57.950 --> 11:01.442
Under the circumstances...
yeah.

11:01.537 --> 11:05.325
Hey, he's right, you know?
We're brothers, from different
sides of an imaginary line.

11:05.415 --> 11:06.495
Good, bad. Bad, good.

11:06.583 --> 11:08.039
Your side, my side, my side...

11:08.126 --> 11:09.286
Sit down!

11:12.214 --> 11:17.334
So, here we are.
Cadaver and Hutch.

11:17.636 --> 11:19.297
A team.

11:21.431 --> 11:22.420
What now?

11:22.516 --> 11:25.508
We must destroy the flowers.

11:25.602 --> 11:26.887
And if I say no?

11:26.979 --> 11:29.220
I will attempt to accomplish
the task myself.

11:29.314 --> 11:33.683
However, rest assured, mine is
now the only path off Katratzi.

11:33.777 --> 11:38.396
Hey! Hey, you better
listen to him, screw.
He's smarter than you.

11:38.490 --> 11:39.730
You used me.

11:39.825 --> 11:41.861
We use each other.
-You're better at it.

11:41.952 --> 11:45.661
Oh, you're learning.
The bomb? Clever.

11:45.747 --> 11:48.489
When it goes off,

11:48.584 --> 11:50.996
plan on being nearby.

11:53.422 --> 11:58.667
Braca:
400 Scarran Scrambler Cannons
were trained on us the microt that you entered here.

11:58.760 --> 12:03.845
Minister Ahkna informed us that
unless you were returned them
safely, they'd fire.

12:03.932 --> 12:05.433
Well, they can't do that.

12:05.517 --> 12:08.259
To honor the truce,
they have to let you go
wherever you want.

12:08.353 --> 12:10.685
They'll let us go.

12:10.772 --> 12:13.514
They just won't let you
leave with us.

12:13.609 --> 12:16.351
They feel it violates the
terms of the agreement.

12:17.863 --> 12:20.275
Braca, Officer Sun?

12:21.283 --> 12:23.114
Could we have a moment
alone, please?

12:23.201 --> 12:25.578
(whispers ):
Stay on Comms.

12:29.583 --> 12:31.869
There's nothing that
I can do to help.

12:31.960 --> 12:34.337
Even the Enhanced Marauder
wouldn't get you clear.

12:34.421 --> 12:37.128
The Scarrans are on full alert,
weapons primed.

12:37.215 --> 12:38.716
You'll never get out of here.

12:38.800 --> 12:40.051
I'll see you later.

12:40.135 --> 12:42.091
Where are you going?
That's a medical area.

12:42.179 --> 12:44.636
l have something I need
to take care of.

12:44.723 --> 12:46.588
Personal problem?

12:46.683 --> 12:48.219
Let's go.

12:48.310 --> 12:50.266
So you need to watch?

12:51.605 --> 12:53.345
Wait for her here.

12:56.318 --> 13:02.905
All that astonishing wormhole
knowledge, and still you will
not share it with us.

13:02.991 --> 13:07.030
You came in here big and bold,
dancing on tabletops,

13:07.120 --> 13:10.157
and look at you now,
begging for scraps.

13:10.248 --> 13:14.491
I may be jammed, possibly dead,
but I'm not begging.

13:14.586 --> 13:16.872
You can get that fantasy
outta your head.

13:16.964 --> 13:20.297
In my hands, you can
have peace.

13:20.384 --> 13:22.295
I can have peace!

13:22.386 --> 13:24.547
I have been in your hands.

13:24.638 --> 13:27.880
There's no peace there,
just power.

13:27.975 --> 13:31.012
You are so self-righteous!

13:31.103 --> 13:37.815
l have used all my skills, all
my resources for one perfect
chance at peace.

13:37.901 --> 13:41.143
And because of you, it is gone!

13:41.238 --> 13:43.399
And lam...

13:44.658 --> 13:46.398
Frelled.

13:47.369 --> 13:48.859
Screwed.

13:50.872 --> 13:52.203
Raped.

13:57.212 --> 14:00.249
Welcome to the universe,
Commandant.

14:11.977 --> 14:14.434
(alien announcement over P.A.)

14:14.521 --> 14:16.887
Chiana:
I can't believe they're
allowing us inside.

14:16.982 --> 14:18.267
Everything's working, right?

14:18.358 --> 14:19.859
Yeah, it seems to be.

14:19.943 --> 14:22.525
All right.
Well, let's get the others.

14:22.612 --> 14:24.568
Blast our way outta here.

14:24.656 --> 14:26.396
No, no. Someone's been in here.

14:26.491 --> 14:27.697
I can smell it.

14:27.784 --> 14:29.285
Well the defenses
were up, right?

14:29.369 --> 14:31.325
No. I don't know what
they've done.

14:31.413 --> 14:35.577
Maybe frelled with the weapons,
planted a homing beacon,
or a bomb.

14:35.667 --> 14:37.453
Frell it!

14:37.544 --> 14:41.378
l have to shut the ship down
and run a full systems
diagnostic check.

14:42.382 --> 14:44.338
How long will that take?

14:45.343 --> 14:46.753
Three arns.

14:46.845 --> 14:49.257
Well what if we find something
that we can't fix?

14:50.390 --> 14:53.006
Then we go with Scorpius' plan.

14:53.101 --> 14:55.763
Frelling elevators.

14:55.854 --> 15:00.393
Rygel:
Lock ourselves in an elevator
while it tunnels through the solid rock?

15:00.484 --> 15:02.315
Noranti:
Sounds reasonable.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.142
Sounds fahrbot!

15:04.237 --> 15:07.024
Sikozu may not be able to
provide elevator access.

15:07.115 --> 15:09.447
Therefore, we need to locate
someone who can.

15:11.119 --> 15:12.199
Stark.

15:12.287 --> 15:13.151
What?

15:13.246 --> 15:14.452
Who's Stark?

15:14.539 --> 15:17.997
Another lunatic with the
wrong number of eyes.

15:18.085 --> 15:19.325
Oh.

15:20.545 --> 15:22.331
And there he is.

15:22.422 --> 15:24.538
He is not.

15:24.633 --> 15:27.625
That is a Bioloid replica.

15:27.719 --> 15:30.506
And how do you know that?

15:31.223 --> 15:32.804
Stark would never torture me.

15:32.891 --> 15:36.509
Emperor Staleek replaced the
real Stark with a Bioloid

15:36.603 --> 15:39.345
to fool Ahkna into
believing he was real.

15:39.439 --> 15:42.727
But you're actually working
for Staleek?

15:42.818 --> 15:44.274
So he believes.

15:44.361 --> 15:47.728
Oh, I do admire your
compartmentalization
of duplicity.

15:47.823 --> 15:50.565
How do we find the real Stark?

15:50.659 --> 15:52.775
Find the Bioloid Duplicator.

15:52.869 --> 15:56.032
Stark is undoubtedly
imprisoned within it.

15:56.123 --> 15:58.580
Where did you disappear to
on the Command Carrier?

15:58.667 --> 16:00.407
Some unfinished business.

16:00.502 --> 16:02.038
Wanna tell me about it?

16:02.129 --> 16:03.539
Later.

16:03.630 --> 16:05.495
D'Argo's still working
on his ship,

16:05.590 --> 16:07.672
and Sikozu's trying to
scam the codes.

16:07.759 --> 16:09.169
Any other alternatives?

16:09.261 --> 16:11.252
Oh, we can always give the
Scarrans what they want.

16:11.346 --> 16:13.211
Dead in a few microns...

16:16.226 --> 16:19.013
Or we could try the
banzai approach.

16:19.104 --> 16:23.188
Or we could just follow
Scorpy's plan.

16:23.275 --> 16:25.766
Damn, you cannot stop following
me around, can ya?

16:25.861 --> 16:27.601
And you just can't leave.

16:27.696 --> 16:29.106
Wouldn't Grayza help you?

16:29.197 --> 16:31.688
Actually, she's the
high bidder.

16:31.783 --> 16:35.196
Perhaps now is the time for
you to hear my offer.

16:35.287 --> 16:37.323
You all go free now.

16:37.414 --> 16:39.075
What's the price?

16:39.166 --> 16:41.248
You leave Scorpius
behind for me.

16:41.334 --> 16:43.199
And what's in it for you?

16:46.506 --> 16:50.749
I will make sure the hierarchy
blames Staleek for your escape.

16:50.844 --> 16:54.132
You understand I know nothing
about Scarran politics.

16:54.222 --> 17:01.014
But I'm guessing that that
means that they fire him
and you get his job.

17:04.482 --> 17:08.020
Ambition.

17:08.111 --> 17:12.571
Well, "if it were done, when
'tis done, 'twere best it
were done quickly."

17:21.333 --> 17:24.325
( chuckles )

17:26.421 --> 17:29.208
Thanks. She scares the
crap out of me.

17:31.509 --> 17:33.591
It's the hat.

17:36.306 --> 17:37.716
Emperor, about Crichton's bomb.

17:37.807 --> 17:40.640
In under a quarter of an am,
we will have computed
the final code.

17:40.727 --> 17:43.844
With it, this will disarm
the detonator.

17:44.314 --> 17:45.554
Sir.

17:46.441 --> 17:49.228
Satisfactory.

17:49.319 --> 17:51.560
Security's been heightened
since the riots.

17:51.655 --> 17:53.236
All the codes have been changed.

17:53.323 --> 17:55.234
What can be done?

17:57.535 --> 18:00.197
There's a master keychip that
overrides all codes.

18:00.288 --> 18:03.200
It'll run the elevator and give
you complete access to the
system's schematics.

18:03.291 --> 18:04.622
Can you get it?

18:04.709 --> 18:05.960
Not very easily.

18:06.044 --> 18:07.159
And if I get caught, then...

18:07.254 --> 18:11.247
It could expose the entire
Kalish underground.

18:11.341 --> 18:15.004
Just tell me this. Will it help
defeat the Scarrans?

18:15.095 --> 18:18.303
Yes. Yes, it will.

18:21.476 --> 18:23.182
Aeryn:
So, what do you think?

18:23.270 --> 18:25.477
Crichton:
I think Lady Macbeth is gonna
find a way to screw us.

18:25.563 --> 18:28.225
But Staleek is probably way
ahead of her.

18:28.316 --> 18:30.181
Which leaves us with Plan...

18:30.277 --> 18:31.062
"Ell?

18:31.152 --> 18:31.937
"E" for...

18:32.028 --> 18:33.404
Both:
Elevator.

18:33.488 --> 18:35.945
Mm-hmm. And I'm gonna tapdance
for the Emperor.

18:36.032 --> 18:37.488
Be careful. He's not an idiot.

18:37.575 --> 18:40.988
I know. But he can't do jack
to me as long as this
bomb's ticking.

18:41.955 --> 18:44.071
(fading whir, stops ticking )

18:47.711 --> 18:49.497
You can't reactivate the
bomb in any way?

18:49.587 --> 18:51.327
Not in any useful manner.

18:51.423 --> 18:52.708
So what are we supposed
to do then?

18:52.799 --> 18:54.630
D, can you get Lo'La
reactivated?

18:54.718 --> 18:56.834
Well it should be another
am at least.

18:56.928 --> 18:58.919
They'll find us in half that.

18:59.014 --> 19:00.129
Sparky, where are ya?

19:00.223 --> 19:02.305
Stuck. Guards all around.

19:02.392 --> 19:03.848
Can't go anywhere at
this point.

19:03.935 --> 19:05.766
Well, get to the elevator
if you can.

19:05.854 --> 19:06.934
Right.

19:07.022 --> 19:08.353
Where is the elevator?

19:08.440 --> 19:09.646
Where is Crichton?

19:09.733 --> 19:12.099
He won't get far.
The station is sealed.

19:12.193 --> 19:16.653
Minister Ahkna, that may
well be your epitaph.

19:19.909 --> 19:21.900
Sikozu has managed to
summon the Rabrokator.

19:21.995 --> 19:23.906
What the hell's that?
Some kind of massage tool?

19:23.997 --> 19:27.364
It's a drilling elevator.
But it won't do us any good
without the keychip.

19:30.295 --> 19:31.831
D'Argo:
What's he doing here?

19:31.921 --> 19:35.505
Scorpius? He's giving us the
shaft as usual. Everybody in.

19:35.592 --> 19:38.129
Mind the gap.
Safer in than out.

19:38.219 --> 19:40.301
I'll try and cross-fire the
drilling controls.

19:40.388 --> 19:43.004
Yes, we can try, but it will
not work without...

19:43.099 --> 19:44.088
Wait!

19:44.184 --> 19:45.970
Wait, wait!
-Wait, wait, wait!

19:47.228 --> 19:48.092
I've got it.

19:48.188 --> 19:49.223
Thank you.

19:49.314 --> 19:50.679
(gasps )

19:51.649 --> 19:53.150
No!

19:56.613 --> 19:58.194
Get us moving.

20:01.993 --> 20:03.529
We have navigational control.

20:03.620 --> 20:04.780
Then go!

20:05.747 --> 20:07.362
(gasps )

20:07.457 --> 20:09.072
You drive like dren.

20:09.167 --> 20:10.373
Get the drills working.

20:10.460 --> 20:13.122
I'm trying, but it's gonna
take a little bit of time.

20:13.213 --> 20:16.080
Take us to the bottom.
The Crystherium cavern.

20:17.425 --> 20:19.461
The shaft ends there.

20:19.552 --> 20:22.715
It means they will not be able
to reach us in another car.

20:22.806 --> 20:27.425
It also means Sikozu has time
to activate the drill.

20:32.524 --> 20:33.855
Crichton.

20:33.942 --> 20:35.307
Crichton!

20:35.402 --> 20:37.358
Ah, frell him!

20:37.445 --> 20:38.901
Let's find Stark.

20:38.988 --> 20:40.444
Good idea. Why?

20:40.532 --> 20:43.615
Scorpius claims Stark
knows this base.

20:43.701 --> 20:45.612
Maybe he knows a way out.

20:45.703 --> 20:46.954
Oh.

20:49.249 --> 20:52.833
They're in the Rabrokator.
We're trying to override.

20:55.380 --> 20:57.336
Ma'am.

20:57.424 --> 21:00.666
Sensors detect weapons fire
within the base.

21:00.760 --> 21:04.173
And communication intercepts
indicate Scarran forces

21:04.264 --> 21:06.755
are in pursuit of Crichton,
with orders to kill.

21:06.850 --> 21:10.388
They must have deactivated
the bomb.

21:10.478 --> 21:12.309
Then he's lost.

21:12.397 --> 21:14.228
As are we.

21:14.315 --> 21:15.521
Go to battle stations.

21:15.608 --> 21:17.018
Ma'am?

21:18.528 --> 21:21.315
Are you questioning me?

21:28.663 --> 21:31.200
I cannot get the drills
activated.

21:33.543 --> 21:35.875
Sputnik, stay on it.

21:40.633 --> 21:44.091
Chiana, the doors!
-Fre|l! Got it!

21:44.179 --> 21:46.215
Aeryn, stay with him.
-Be careful.

21:47.307 --> 21:48.843
That was not me.

21:48.933 --> 21:51.049
They're trying to override
the override!

21:51.144 --> 21:54.011
Dueling overrides.
Don't you hate that?

21:54.105 --> 21:56.187
Okay, Lo'La should be
functional by now.

21:56.274 --> 22:00.483
Start the drills, get us to the
surface, and I'll signal
Lo'La, then we go!

22:12.457 --> 22:15.164
We must destroy them.
-Why?

22:15.251 --> 22:17.833
The mother plant is the key.
It fertilizes the others.

22:17.921 --> 22:22.255
Kill it and no new Crystherium
can grow here.

22:33.561 --> 22:35.062
(gun beeps)

22:38.441 --> 22:40.181
Shielded.

22:40.276 --> 22:42.562
The Rabrokator has stopped
at the Crystherium cavern.

22:42.654 --> 22:45.521
I want it recalled. Now!

22:46.324 --> 22:47.439
Come on.

22:48.368 --> 22:49.574
Hurry up.

22:49.661 --> 22:52.027
Come on.
-These doors are
getting pushier.

22:53.581 --> 22:56.163
I didn't know about it.

22:56.251 --> 23:00.164
Stark didn't know about it!

23:00.255 --> 23:04.043
This must be a new addition
by the Scarrans!

23:04.133 --> 23:05.873
He doesn't like to lose,
does he?

23:06.844 --> 23:08.220
Got it.

23:08.304 --> 23:11.216
The drills are enabled.
We can core our way to anywhere
on the planet.

23:11.307 --> 23:13.639
I've regained control of
the drilling elevator.

23:13.726 --> 23:16.342
Now get it back up
to this level.

23:16.437 --> 23:18.348
(shrieks)

23:18.439 --> 23:19.474
D'Argo!

23:19.566 --> 23:21.807
I'll handle it.
-Yeah.

23:24.696 --> 23:26.311
Get it open!

23:26.698 --> 23:27.608
Frell!

23:27.699 --> 23:29.781
(grunting)
-Come on!

23:33.204 --> 23:34.535
D'Argo, hurry up!

23:34.622 --> 23:39.616
(grunting)

23:39.711 --> 23:40.621
Go, go, go, go!

23:40.712 --> 23:41.497
Oh no, wait, wait, wait!

23:41.588 --> 23:42.998
Sikozu, don't!
-Keychip!

23:43.089 --> 23:44.329
( screaming )

23:46.843 --> 23:48.424
What the frell's going on
up there?

23:48.511 --> 23:51.048
We couldn't override their
override of our override.

23:51.139 --> 23:54.347
Oh, great. They stole our
getaway car.

23:54.434 --> 23:56.425
That's our only way out.

23:58.479 --> 24:00.686
And their way in.

24:08.990 --> 24:12.153
Your father would be
proud, Ahkna.

24:12.243 --> 24:16.282
Security under him was riddled
with top-down incompetence
as well.

24:16.372 --> 24:22.333
Jenek:
Emperor. The Command Carrier is
showing increasing signs of battle readiness.

24:24.255 --> 24:25.415
Any other exits?

24:25.506 --> 24:28.748
No, it's nothing but rock
and hay fever.

24:31.554 --> 24:32.839
Company's coming.

24:32.930 --> 24:34.921
Frell.
-Time to go.

24:35.016 --> 24:36.506
(zapping)

24:38.269 --> 24:39.349
Grasshopper.

24:39.437 --> 24:40.802
Hide.

24:50.239 --> 24:52.275
Get down.

24:52.367 --> 24:55.234
Hey, did you get my bomb?
-What?

24:55.328 --> 24:59.537
Whoa. I can't believe that
I left a nuclear bomb
in an elevator.

24:59.624 --> 25:03.162
Well, that's all right.
You've done worse.

25:03.252 --> 25:05.459
These weapons will be useless
if they're Scarrans.

25:05.546 --> 25:07.047
It's gonna be Scarrans.

25:10.426 --> 25:14.260
You cannot be taken alive, John.
-Be quiet.

25:14.347 --> 25:15.587
Chiana:
Am I wrong or are we frelled?

25:15.682 --> 25:18.094
No. There is a way.

25:18.184 --> 25:21.096
I'm not like normal Kalish.

25:21.187 --> 25:23.303
There are others like me.

25:23.398 --> 25:28.518
We're part of a resistance
movement, dedicated to
overthrowing Scarran domination.

25:29.779 --> 25:31.519
( sniffs )

25:33.408 --> 25:40.621
We are genetically engineered
to kill Scarrans by emitting
an intense radiation

25:40.707 --> 25:44.791
that specifically destroys
their heat producing gland.

25:44.877 --> 25:47.789
Did anyone else know about
this, or is itjust me?

25:47.880 --> 25:49.211
Uh...

25:50.425 --> 25:52.211
Okay Sikozu, go ahead.

25:52.301 --> 25:55.429
Not without a promise first.

25:58.266 --> 26:03.351
If the Scarrans were to learn
there are others engineered
like myself,

26:03.438 --> 26:07.556
they would kill millions of
innocents to root us out.

26:07.650 --> 26:11.234
Sikozu, we're a team.

26:11.904 --> 26:13.735
Your promise is safe.

26:14.782 --> 26:16.363
Guards.

26:27.712 --> 26:33.628
D'Argo, Scarrans are very good
at retrieving the truth.

26:33.718 --> 26:35.254
We're not gonna be
tortured again.

26:35.344 --> 26:36.754
Agreed.

26:36.846 --> 26:38.461
Agreed. Go.

26:43.394 --> 26:45.225
Do not look upon me.

26:46.439 --> 26:49.101
Especially you.

26:54.155 --> 26:55.520
Hold fire.

26:55.615 --> 26:58.197
Kalish, present yourself
and surrender.

27:12.256 --> 27:15.544
(gagging )

27:32.193 --> 27:34.935
Okay, Chiana. Grab the weapons.
-Got it.

27:35.029 --> 27:37.395
Come on Scorp, let's go.
-Let's go.

27:38.282 --> 27:40.398
She'll be fine.
Get those weapons.

27:43.412 --> 27:45.619
Grasshopper, it's time.

27:45.706 --> 27:47.287
No.

27:47.375 --> 27:48.740
We gotta go.

27:50.211 --> 27:53.419
Do the math. It's over.

27:56.342 --> 28:00.301
I... do not lose!

28:02.306 --> 28:04.422
Be happy to give you lessons.

28:04.517 --> 28:06.678
Now... you in or out?

28:15.278 --> 28:17.394
Come on, let's go!

28:19.907 --> 28:21.863
(panel beeping)

28:22.410 --> 28:24.150
Come on!

28:27.707 --> 28:29.322
Hurry up!

28:41.178 --> 28:42.304
Is that him?

28:42.388 --> 28:44.629
Yes. Yes, it is.

28:44.724 --> 28:46.214
Open it up.

28:50.229 --> 28:52.311
Stark. Stark!

28:52.398 --> 28:54.354
Are you alive?

28:54.442 --> 28:55.602
Rygel?

28:55.693 --> 28:58.526
Oh, you lunatic.

29:01.198 --> 29:03.689
You... you're green.

29:03.784 --> 29:05.820
How lovely of you to notice.

29:05.912 --> 29:09.746
Is nothing sacred?

29:09.832 --> 29:14.246
You wanna deal with Stark,
you're gonna have to
deal with me.

29:14.337 --> 29:15.543
No! Let go!

29:15.630 --> 29:18.838
You pompous little
Dominar of nothing!

29:18.925 --> 29:21.792
I'm gonna rip your tiny
little heart out.

29:23.471 --> 29:27.214
( sizzling )

29:28.017 --> 29:29.302
Thanks, witch.

29:29.393 --> 29:30.803
My pleasure.

29:33.773 --> 29:36.890
Commandant Grayza, see reason.

29:36.984 --> 29:43.275
Reason indicates that you have
subverted this conference and
with it, any chance of peace.

29:43.366 --> 29:45.106
Ridiculous.

29:45.201 --> 29:50.741
Your vessel arms itself for
battle while we continue to
operate under a banner of truce.

29:50.831 --> 29:55.165
Reason dictates that I not
believe a single word you say.

29:55.252 --> 29:57.994
Reconsider, Peacekeeper.

29:58.089 --> 30:01.377
Adhere to the name you have
chosen for your kind.

30:03.928 --> 30:06.294
Monitor their every move
and transmission.

30:06.389 --> 30:12.851
Should they attack,
annihilate them without mercy.

30:12.937 --> 30:15.804
Ma'am, what are you doing?

30:16.816 --> 30:18.977
Pursuing honor, Captain.

30:19.986 --> 30:22.728
We're at peace. Under truce.

30:22.822 --> 30:26.280
And vastly outnumbered.

30:26.367 --> 30:30.110
And about to rewrite the
course of history.

30:30.204 --> 30:35.574
Prepare to launch simultaneous
salvos on every weapons
system. Now!

30:37.128 --> 30:38.709
Sergeant.

30:40.506 --> 30:41.791
(computer blipping)

30:41.882 --> 30:43.918
Have we solved the
override problem yet?

30:44.010 --> 30:45.750
Not yet.
-Did you put the key in?

30:45.845 --> 30:47.301
Yes, | used the frelling key.

30:47.388 --> 30:49.674
Why do we even bother?

30:53.602 --> 30:56.309
What are you doing?
-Sending a message.

30:56.397 --> 30:58.308
The connection has been severed.

30:58.399 --> 30:59.263
Fix it.

30:59.358 --> 31:00.564
Drill's on.

31:00.651 --> 31:02.687
Hey, you know how to drive
this Wonkavator?

31:02.778 --> 31:03.733
Do you?

31:03.821 --> 31:06.028
No.
-Then why ask?

31:06.407 --> 31:07.863
Chiana:
Frell!

31:14.040 --> 31:18.329
Kalish sensors report an
unusual energy discharge
in the cavern.

31:18.419 --> 31:20.159
The status of the Crystherium?

31:20.254 --> 31:21.619
Unknown.

31:21.714 --> 31:24.205
We've lost contact with
the Strike Team.

31:24.300 --> 31:25.540
And Crichton?

31:25.634 --> 31:29.252
He has activated the drill and
is coring through solid rock.

31:29.346 --> 31:33.840
Impossible to predict his
destination, my love.

31:33.934 --> 31:36.971
I'll tell you your
destination, my love.

31:37.063 --> 31:40.772
A frelling torture station
if you don't stop him!

31:44.236 --> 31:46.898
Right, well, you at least
know how to get where
we're going, right?

31:46.989 --> 31:48.104
No.

31:48.199 --> 31:50.190
Well then, go faster.

31:50.910 --> 31:52.275
Here's faster.

31:58.417 --> 32:00.203
It's a hell of a ride.

32:03.589 --> 32:05.329
Kinda fun, huh?

32:07.426 --> 32:09.667
Okay, it's no longer a joke.

32:12.765 --> 32:16.223
Staleek:
Protection of the Crystherium
was your number one priority.

32:16.310 --> 32:20.644
Yes, my Lord, but it was not
I who gave permission for
the access code.

32:20.731 --> 32:22.642
What are you implying, Rahzaro?
We had nothing!

32:22.733 --> 32:25.019
Do not give me your excuses.

32:25.111 --> 32:26.692
Sire.

32:26.779 --> 32:30.567
Commandant Grayza refuses to
acknowledge on all frequencies.

32:30.658 --> 32:34.150
I credit her choice of suicide
over failure.

32:34.245 --> 32:35.701
How are you positioned?

32:35.788 --> 32:39.280
Well, they will be accorded
every opportunity to cease fire.

32:39.375 --> 32:43.243
Peacekeeper Command will find
no fault with our self-defense.

32:43.337 --> 32:47.831
Captain Jenek here epitomizes
the competence I demand.

32:47.925 --> 32:52.134
Perhaps you can next assist
Minister Ahkna in her follies?

32:52.221 --> 32:55.634
Capture Crichton and her
job will be yours.

32:55.724 --> 32:57.134
Sire.

32:59.353 --> 33:00.638
Fools.

33:03.065 --> 33:06.398
Tell me when target
acquisitions are complete.

33:06.485 --> 33:10.945
Ma'am. There is no battle
here, ma'am.

33:11.031 --> 33:12.896
Why are you so averse to
conflict, Captain?

33:12.992 --> 33:15.108
And why are you so adversed?!

33:15.202 --> 33:16.442
How dare you?

33:16.537 --> 33:18.653
Who do you think you are?

33:18.747 --> 33:22.865
Captain Miklo Braca, Officer of
the Fleet, Peacekeeper
lnterplanetary Service.

33:22.960 --> 33:26.327
Oh. Nobody.

33:26.422 --> 33:27.832
Ma'am, you'll start a war.

33:27.923 --> 33:29.174
A war is inevitable.

33:29.258 --> 33:31.419
Braca:
We sail under a flag of truce.

33:31.510 --> 33:33.501
Let us leave beneath
its protection.

33:33.596 --> 33:38.260
Didn't Scorpius tell you?
Truce with the Scarrans
is suicide.

33:38.350 --> 33:42.263
Oh. So the men and women
of this vessel

33:42.354 --> 33:45.221
must pay for your miscalculation
with their lives.

33:45.316 --> 33:47.602
Grayza:
It's for the greater
good, Captain.

33:47.693 --> 33:50.685
And we shall all be
remembered as heroes.

34:03.417 --> 34:05.078
Commandant Grayza.

34:05.169 --> 34:10.380
Under Article Six Rulu, Uniform
Code of Admiralty Conduct,
Section 19:

34:10.466 --> 34:14.550
Due to a state of incapacitation
ofjudgment displayed in
multiple encounters

34:14.637 --> 34:19.301
under stress, I hereby invoke
the Transfer of Command

34:19.391 --> 34:22.428
and relieve you of duty
immediately.

34:24.271 --> 34:26.102
( Grayza chuckles )

34:26.190 --> 34:27.805
Officer of the Deck!

34:27.900 --> 34:30.186
Weapons!

34:30.277 --> 34:35.817
Would you be so kind as to
shoot this mutinous captain
dead where he stands.

34:40.371 --> 34:42.111
Sorry, ma'am.

34:42.206 --> 34:45.073
Captain Braca has already
relieved you of command.

34:46.835 --> 34:49.372
Braca:
Now let's get this
ship out of here.

34:53.425 --> 34:56.258
Crichton:
I never did... like Disneyland.

34:56.804 --> 34:58.294
( both gasping )

34:58.389 --> 35:01.256
Oh! Dad, are we there yet?

35:01.350 --> 35:02.510
My head hurts.

35:02.601 --> 35:04.182
Chiana ( laughing ):
Let's go again!

35:04.270 --> 35:05.976
(loud whirring)
Oh!

35:12.069 --> 35:16.403
From this moment on, you will
disregard her status as
Ruling Caste Scarran

35:16.490 --> 35:18.981
and ignore Minister
Ahkna's orders.

35:19.076 --> 35:21.237
Am I clear?
-Sire.

35:21.328 --> 35:26.243
Besides myself, John Crichton
is the single most important
person on this base.

35:26.333 --> 35:28.745
Am I clear?!

35:30.296 --> 35:34.039
Apprehend him and bring
him before me now.

35:37.303 --> 35:39.009
(grunting)

35:40.139 --> 35:41.254
Your Excellency!

35:41.348 --> 35:44.806
You must leave now.
It's the elevator!

35:50.816 --> 35:53.273
(yelling)

35:58.657 --> 36:01.319
(motor winding down)
Did we hit the surface?

36:01.410 --> 36:03.321
Crichton:
I don't know. Let's find out.
D, the doors.

36:03.412 --> 36:05.118
Secure the Emperor's safety!

36:05.205 --> 36:07.241
You, you and you with me!

36:07.333 --> 36:08.322
Staleek:
Alive!

36:08.417 --> 36:10.282
Keep Crichton alive!

36:10.377 --> 36:11.492
Sire.

36:15.341 --> 36:18.549
General Rahzaro, it's Crichton
and the others.

36:20.512 --> 36:21.797
Be ready.

36:21.889 --> 36:23.129
The lights not working.

36:23.223 --> 36:24.724
D'Argo:
Nothing's working.

36:24.808 --> 36:26.844
Let's find out where we are.

36:28.562 --> 36:30.018
Fire!

36:30.105 --> 36:33.268
Whoa! Okay. That's no good.
-Where are we?

36:33.359 --> 36:35.520
Crichton:
Um... conference room.
-What?

36:35.611 --> 36:38.478
Rahzaro:
Come out now or die!

36:40.074 --> 36:42.907
Are we cursed?
Could we be cursed?

36:42.993 --> 36:44.574
Well, that depends on whether
this will hold.

36:44.661 --> 36:46.367
Fire again!

36:47.331 --> 36:49.822
Scorpius:
The Rabrokator is quite strong.

36:49.917 --> 36:52.283
We can't stay in here forever.
What about that hatch?

36:52.378 --> 36:53.367
No.

36:53.462 --> 36:55.623
No, it'll be a drop of
at least a metra.

36:55.714 --> 36:58.922
Sparky? Grandma?

36:59.009 --> 37:00.419
Where have you been?

37:00.511 --> 37:03.844
We're at D'Argo's ship, and
it's crawling with Scarrans.

37:03.931 --> 37:06.764
Here's our chance to see
if Lo'La is reactivated.

37:06.850 --> 37:09.102
Rygel, are you standing
near the ship?

37:09.186 --> 37:11.472
Well clear. Why?

37:11.563 --> 37:13.394
( D'Argo speaks Luxan )

37:14.691 --> 37:17.023
Rygel:
Hey, Vaskreta!

37:20.114 --> 37:21.229
That did it!

37:21.323 --> 37:23.655
The guards are down. We did it!

37:29.331 --> 37:32.323
We've reached the
Crystherium chamber.

37:33.836 --> 37:35.701
All dead.

37:42.553 --> 37:45.511
Hold your positions until
reinforcements arrive.

37:45.597 --> 37:48.259
I will check on the Emperor.

37:48.350 --> 37:50.807
They are not to leave here!

37:55.232 --> 37:56.938
Grasshopper.

37:57.025 --> 37:58.856
How important is that
mother plant?

37:58.944 --> 38:03.108
I would trade my life for
its destruction.

38:03.782 --> 38:06.023
What about my wormhole debt?

38:08.078 --> 38:10.034
Of course.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.240
Ryge.

38:16.211 --> 38:17.587
Are you in Lo'La?

38:17.671 --> 38:19.957
Yes, Crichton. We're safe.

38:24.011 --> 38:26.252
What have you done, John?

38:26.346 --> 38:28.086
Just fixed your little
flower problem.

38:28.182 --> 38:30.389
You reactivated it, didn't you?

38:30.476 --> 38:32.091
Yeah.

38:32.186 --> 38:34.142
It should go off in about...

38:34.229 --> 38:35.639
60 microts.

38:35.731 --> 38:37.062
And then it explodes?

38:37.149 --> 38:38.389
Yeah.

38:38.484 --> 38:39.940
A big explosion?

38:40.027 --> 38:41.187
Mm.

38:41.278 --> 38:43.985
( bomb beeping )

38:44.072 --> 38:47.530
Oh. God, we should've voted.

38:47.618 --> 38:50.075
All in favor, show of hands.

38:52.623 --> 38:54.534
All opposed?

38:56.335 --> 38:59.077
Three to two. Sikozu abstains.

38:59.171 --> 39:03.505
The concussive pressure
must exit through the
elevator system.

39:03.592 --> 39:05.048
D'Argo:
And this shaft.

39:05.135 --> 39:08.969
At this distance the
compartment should protect us.

39:09.056 --> 39:10.921
It might work.

39:12.142 --> 39:15.259
We'll find out in 15 microts.

39:19.900 --> 39:22.858
This is your last chance.

39:22.945 --> 39:24.401
Come out!

39:24.488 --> 39:26.319
Now!

39:34.081 --> 39:35.161
Love you.

39:35.249 --> 39:36.238
Love you, too.

39:37.709 --> 39:41.918
Emperor, the Crystheriums
are intact.

39:42.005 --> 39:44.337
The matriarch plant has
not been harmed.

39:44.424 --> 39:47.211
Our fears were completely
groundless.

39:47.302 --> 39:48.678
Three...

39:51.723 --> 39:52.974
Sikozu:
Two...

39:55.644 --> 39:57.350
( beeping )

40:02.693 --> 40:05.435
(rumbling)

40:13.537 --> 40:15.152
What is that?

40:29.803 --> 40:31.919
Rygel:
Crichton!

40:32.014 --> 40:34.756
What the hezmana just happened?!

40:34.850 --> 40:37.182
Where are you, you fahrbots?!

40:37.269 --> 40:41.137
Did you blow up the bomb?
How could you blow up the bomb?!

40:41.231 --> 40:43.688
You missed the vote.

40:53.327 --> 40:56.319
I never thought I'd see you
again, Stark.

40:56.413 --> 40:58.119
And I always believed I would.

40:58.206 --> 41:01.198
It is a pleasure to
have you aboard.

41:01.293 --> 41:03.158
Time for another Starburst,
Pilot?

41:03.253 --> 41:06.086
Moya and I believe
four is enough.

41:06.173 --> 41:10.132
She's tired and there's no
evidence that anyone
is pursuing us.

41:10.218 --> 41:12.254
Scarrans must still be
too busy on Katratzi.

41:12.346 --> 41:15.179
Rygel:
They got off easy.

41:15.265 --> 41:21.477
And to celebrate the victory,
I shall cook a voluptuous
caspitian haunch stew.

41:21.563 --> 41:23.394
(sighs)

41:29.029 --> 41:31.611
(sighs)

41:33.909 --> 41:36.025
( D'Argo chuckles softly)

41:36.119 --> 41:40.078
( both chuckling )

41:45.587 --> 41:48.329
More. More.
-More. More.

41:51.218 --> 41:54.255
How long does it take
for you to recover?

41:55.597 --> 41:58.009
I do not know.

41:58.934 --> 42:01.300
I've never done this before.

42:40.475 --> 42:42.306
Huh.

42:43.061 --> 42:44.847
Stark.

42:47.065 --> 42:48.180
Hm.

42:48.275 --> 42:51.187
Everything old is new again.

42:54.239 --> 42:57.402
Except the old thing's
getting really old.

43:04.207 --> 43:07.119
Hey, honey.

43:10.005 --> 43:12.462
Guess what I did at work today.

43:15.260 --> 43:17.546
I wore a bomb.

43:20.140 --> 43:24.304
A nuclear bomb in a
field of flowers.

43:28.982 --> 43:31.439
I could get lucky.

43:32.861 --> 43:36.103
Tomorrow I could have
a bigger bomb.

43:43.955 --> 43:47.197
I could kill more people.

43:51.922 --> 43:54.504
Maybe they'll be
innocent people.

43:58.428 --> 44:01.465
Children, maybe.
