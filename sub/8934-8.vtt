WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:02.168
This is
the evergreen forest.

00:03.636 --> 00:05.939
Quiet, peaceful, serene.

00:07.774 --> 00:10.610
That is until Bert
Raccoon wakes up.

00:10.710 --> 00:11.544
Yoo-hoo!

00:13.913 --> 00:15.215
Yoo-hoo!

00:23.523 --> 00:25.458
Luckily he
has some good friends

00:25.558 --> 00:26.493
to help him out.

00:33.933 --> 00:35.435
Life would be
simple in the forest

00:35.535 --> 00:39.172
except for Cyril Sneer.

00:43.443 --> 00:46.913
And his life would be simple
except for "The Raccoons."

01:01.961 --> 01:05.165
On a perfectly ordinary morning
in the evergreen forest,

01:05.265 --> 01:07.400
things usually go as planned.

01:07.500 --> 01:10.703
Unless of course, Bert
Raccoon happens along,

01:10.804 --> 01:13.773
then the day can turn
around like magic.

01:14.974 --> 01:18.311
I may not be as good
as The Great Tromboni,

01:18.411 --> 01:22.582
but cast your eyes
on this, Cedric.

01:22.682 --> 01:24.617
Nothing up my sleeve.

01:24.717 --> 01:26.019
Voila!

01:26.119 --> 01:27.220
Wow!

01:27.320 --> 01:30.690
Gee Bert, I didn't know
you were into magic.

01:30.790 --> 01:32.125
Are you kidding?

01:32.225 --> 01:34.327
I've loved magic for ages.

01:34.427 --> 01:39.165
Why, I could make a peanut
butter soda disappear like that.

01:41.267 --> 01:42.569
Here he comes, Cedric.

01:42.669 --> 01:45.738
The greatest magician,
illusionist and escape artist

01:45.839 --> 01:47.207
on the planet!

01:47.307 --> 01:52.278
And he's playing the
Blue Spruce Cafe, oh wow.

01:59.285 --> 02:00.453
Whoa.

02:00.553 --> 02:01.955
That's him, Cedric.

02:02.055 --> 02:03.490
That's Tromboni!

02:03.590 --> 02:07.694
Boy, Tromboni sure knows
how to make an entrance.

02:07.794 --> 02:11.631
Come one, come all to
see The Great Tromboni!

02:13.967 --> 02:17.137
Be amazed, be
stupefied, but be there!

02:23.510 --> 02:26.412
Very
impressive, Mr Sneer.

02:26.513 --> 02:27.614
Impressive?

02:27.714 --> 02:30.450
This Sneer secure
vault is impenetrable!

02:30.550 --> 02:34.053
12 inches of tungsten
titanium steel mesh,

02:34.154 --> 02:37.390
with heat resistant
graphite ceramic armor.

02:37.490 --> 02:39.392
Oh, she's a doozy

02:39.492 --> 02:40.393
I'm sure.

02:41.861 --> 02:46.866
How much would you be asking
for the vault Mr. Sneer?

02:47.467 --> 02:48.568
Well Knox,

02:48.668 --> 02:50.570
all that security stuff
doesn't come cheap.

02:50.670 --> 02:53.840
Besides, you can't put
a price on happiness.

02:53.940 --> 02:55.642
Try.

02:55.742 --> 02:57.610
Oh, three quarters
of a $1 million.

02:57.710 --> 02:58.444
Hmm?

02:58.545 --> 02:59.412
It's a steal.

02:59.512 --> 03:01.047
Your prize is a little steep

03:01.147 --> 03:04.250
and this is an untested product.

03:04.350 --> 03:06.085
What guarantees do I have?

03:07.287 --> 03:09.322
Oh, any kind you want.

03:09.422 --> 03:10.557
Pick one.

03:10.657 --> 03:13.860
Well, thank you for
the demonstration, sir.

03:15.261 --> 03:19.199
But I believe I'll do a
little comparative shopping.

03:19.299 --> 03:21.768
Fine, fine, I never
rush a customer.

03:21.868 --> 03:23.269
But don't take all day.

03:27.974 --> 03:32.979
Boy, this is pretty heavy
for a bunch of illusions.

03:34.147 --> 03:36.349
Where would you like
this, Mr. Tromboni?

03:36.449 --> 03:37.917
Right there's good, Bert.

03:38.017 --> 03:40.653
Here goes, wish
me luck Cedric.

03:42.055 --> 03:45.158
Mr. Tromboni, I was
wondering, uh...

03:45.258 --> 03:49.829
I mean, do you think I
could be your apprentice?

03:49.929 --> 03:51.864
So you want to be a magician.

03:51.965 --> 03:53.066
Boy, do I ever.

03:53.166 --> 03:54.934
Do you know how
much work is involved

03:55.034 --> 03:56.803
in learning the
art of magic, Bert?

03:56.903 --> 03:59.505
I don't care, because
being a magician

03:59.606 --> 04:02.475
has gotta be the greatest
thing in the world.

04:02.575 --> 04:06.579
Mystifying people,
stupefying crowds,

04:06.679 --> 04:08.281
it'd be great!

04:09.616 --> 04:11.651
Well, you certainly
have the right attitude.

04:11.751 --> 04:14.587
Now, watch this.

04:14.687 --> 04:16.356
Abracadabra, ta-dah!

04:18.124 --> 04:18.958
What do you think?

04:19.058 --> 04:21.227
Good, but it could be better.

04:22.161 --> 04:22.895
Wow.

04:22.996 --> 04:24.564
And it's real

04:24.664 --> 04:25.765
Yoo-hoo!

04:25.865 --> 04:27.166
Oh, Mr. Tromboni!

04:29.736 --> 04:33.473
Mr. Tromboni,
Lady Baden-Baden.

04:33.573 --> 04:38.144
Oh, Mr. Tromboni, it's
such a thrill to meet you.

04:38.244 --> 04:40.980
And when I heard you
were visiting the forest

04:41.080 --> 04:44.917
I simply had to invite you
to my charity luncheon.

04:45.018 --> 04:49.856
I was hoping perhaps you
could put on a small spectacle

04:49.956 --> 04:51.324
for my guests.

04:51.424 --> 04:55.128
Lady Baden-Baden,
I'd be honored.

04:55.228 --> 04:57.730
Ooh, how gallant.

04:57.830 --> 05:00.300
Until noon then, tah-tah!

05:00.400 --> 05:03.536
Well Bert, if you are
serious about learning magic,

05:03.636 --> 05:05.538
we'll start at noon.

05:07.540 --> 05:09.776
Cedric, did you hear that?

05:09.876 --> 05:12.045
I'm gonna be a magician!

05:12.145 --> 05:14.814
You won't regret
this, Mr. Tromboni.

05:14.914 --> 05:17.583
I'll be the best
apprentice you ever had.

05:18.418 --> 05:19.919
Yoo-hoo!

05:21.954 --> 05:24.157
And then after he is chained up,

05:24.257 --> 05:27.527
they weld him into
a steel milk can

05:27.627 --> 05:29.929
and drop him out of an airplane.

05:30.029 --> 05:31.397
And he escapes?

05:31.497 --> 05:33.566
That's fantastic.

05:33.666 --> 05:35.601
Ooh, that's terrifying.

05:37.203 --> 05:39.605
I laugh at danger.

05:43.509 --> 05:47.146
So, do I look like the
well dressed magician?

05:47.246 --> 05:48.581
Very spiffy, Bert.

05:48.681 --> 05:50.016
Oh, I can't wait

05:50.116 --> 05:53.319
till I'm the greatest
magician in the world!

05:54.420 --> 05:56.656
Hmm, gotta get that fixed.

05:56.756 --> 06:00.927
And now I'm off to Lady
Baden-Baden's luncheon.

06:01.027 --> 06:03.863
So if you'll just
close your eyes,

06:03.963 --> 06:06.699
I will perform an amazing stunt.

06:07.600 --> 06:08.835
I'll disappear.

06:10.536 --> 06:13.706
Amazing, and I thought it
was all done with mirrors.

06:15.007 --> 06:17.310
Come on, Knox,
don't be a tightwad,

06:17.410 --> 06:19.946
you need the Sneer secure vault,

06:20.046 --> 06:22.515
be the first on your
block to install one.

06:22.615 --> 06:26.552
Mr. Sneer, I have
heard the sales pitch.

06:26.652 --> 06:30.022
Now, kindly back off.

06:30.123 --> 06:30.957
Right.

06:31.057 --> 06:33.159
They're almost ready, pop.

06:33.259 --> 06:34.327
Wait till you see this,

06:34.427 --> 06:36.929
the world's greatest
escape artist.

06:37.029 --> 06:39.599
And now, without further ado,

06:39.699 --> 06:42.101
appearing before us,

06:44.404 --> 06:45.938
The Great Tromboni!

06:49.375 --> 06:51.577
Thank you, and good afternoon.

06:51.677 --> 06:55.915
As you can see my able
assistant, Bert Raccoon,

06:56.015 --> 06:58.050
has chained me up securely.

06:58.151 --> 06:59.685
Are you sure about this?

06:59.786 --> 07:01.554
It's all right, Bert.

07:01.654 --> 07:06.325
And now he will lock me in
inside this brass bound trunk.

07:07.760 --> 07:11.464
Ladies and gentlemen, we
ask for complete silence

07:11.564 --> 07:14.567
during this difficult
and daring escape.

07:19.105 --> 07:20.673
Mr. Tromboni?

07:20.773 --> 07:22.809
Thank you, ladies
and gentlemen.

07:22.909 --> 07:26.446
As you can see, no
nefarious device

07:26.546 --> 07:30.550
can hold the great
Tromboni for long.

07:30.650 --> 07:34.687
I will escape from
anything, anywhere, anytime.

07:36.189 --> 07:38.491
Well, here's your
chance to prove

07:38.591 --> 07:42.261
the quality of your
new vault Mr. Sneer.

07:43.296 --> 07:44.030
What?

07:44.130 --> 07:45.298
You don't mean...

07:45.398 --> 07:49.469
If the great Tromboni
can't escape the vault,

07:49.569 --> 07:52.672
I will happily
purchase one, or more.

07:54.907 --> 07:56.809
Oh, what a great
idea, Mr. Knox.

07:56.909 --> 08:00.813
Like you said, sir,
it's impenetrable.

08:00.913 --> 08:02.515
Um, yeah.

08:02.615 --> 08:05.017
Great, all right.

08:05.117 --> 08:07.153
You're on, Knox.

08:07.253 --> 08:10.823
Tromboni, I challenge
you to escape

08:10.923 --> 08:13.192
from my Sneer secure vault.

08:14.126 --> 08:14.861
I accept, sir.

08:14.961 --> 08:15.862
With pleasure.

08:18.698 --> 08:20.900
Heat resistant,
graphite, ceramic armor.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.337
You don't mind if I do
the honors, do you Raccoon?

08:24.437 --> 08:26.806
By all means, Mr. Sneer.

08:28.641 --> 08:30.576
Nice pose, Cyril.

08:30.676 --> 08:32.478
You designed
this vault, Cedric.

08:32.578 --> 08:34.580
What are Tromboni's chances?

08:34.680 --> 08:37.316
Well, if I were here
him I'd pack a lunch.

08:37.416 --> 08:41.120
Are you satisfied
everything's secure, Mr. Sneer?

08:41.220 --> 08:44.490
Those chains are tighter
than one of my contracts.

08:45.992 --> 08:48.628
Then let's proceed.

08:48.728 --> 08:51.097
All right, lock him up boys!

08:53.432 --> 08:56.536
You'll never get out of here.

08:59.572 --> 09:03.009
Well Knox, I guess
I've proved my point.

09:03.109 --> 09:05.444
Tromboni's in there
for the duration,

09:05.545 --> 09:07.914
so we might as well
close the deal.

09:08.014 --> 09:11.551
Our easy payment plan
is straightforward;

09:11.651 --> 09:14.820
I take the cash,
you get the vault.

09:15.755 --> 09:17.156
Not now.

09:17.256 --> 09:18.558
Tromboni!

09:18.658 --> 09:20.860
I knew he'd get out!

09:24.096 --> 09:27.366
Mr. Sneer, just let me
check you on that quote.

09:27.466 --> 09:31.237
I believe you said, Tromboni
is in there for the duration?

09:32.371 --> 09:34.340
Wasn't
that amazing, Cyril?

09:34.440 --> 09:35.975
Yeah, amazing.

09:38.144 --> 09:39.545
Okay Broo, this is it.

09:39.645 --> 09:43.616
Lesson number one, and
this time I'll do it right.

09:44.817 --> 09:46.085
Oh, I can't do it.

09:46.185 --> 09:47.887
I'll never be able to do it.

09:47.987 --> 09:51.490
Besides, this hasn't got
anything to do with magic.

09:51.591 --> 09:56.128
Magic is the disappearing
cabinet, levitation,

09:56.228 --> 09:58.531
that's the kind of
stuff I wanna do.

09:58.631 --> 10:00.766
Hey Broo, watch this;

10:00.866 --> 10:03.169
Nothing up my sleeve, right?

10:03.269 --> 10:04.971
Abracapocas!

10:05.071 --> 10:06.072
What?

10:08.808 --> 10:11.911
A little too much of the
old flash powder, eh Broo?

10:13.713 --> 10:14.547
Ugh, gee.

10:16.549 --> 10:18.551
Hi Bert, hi Broo.

10:18.651 --> 10:20.086
Oh, hi guys.

10:21.287 --> 10:24.690
I was just practicing
my coin manipulations.

10:24.790 --> 10:27.159
Tromboni says it
sharpens the eye,

10:27.259 --> 10:28.894
quickens the hand and...

10:28.995 --> 10:30.162
Oops.

10:30.262 --> 10:32.331
Well, it still
needs a little work.

10:32.431 --> 10:34.834
It's great to see you
working so hard on this Bert.

10:34.934 --> 10:36.802
We thought you might
like to see this.

10:36.902 --> 10:38.070
Wow!

10:38.170 --> 10:41.440
This one definitely
goes in my scrapbook.

10:41.540 --> 10:42.842
Gee, thanks guys.

10:42.942 --> 10:44.910
Well, we'll let
you get back at it.

10:45.011 --> 10:46.212
See ya.

10:46.312 --> 10:48.347
You know, Bert, when
you first started this

10:48.447 --> 10:51.484
I didn't think you'd have
the patience to stick to it.

10:51.584 --> 10:53.319
I think that's great.

10:53.419 --> 10:54.587
Ha!

10:54.687 --> 10:58.024
You think that's
great, watch this.

10:58.124 --> 11:00.059
Hat, milk.

11:00.159 --> 11:02.161
Uh
Bert, are you sure?

11:02.261 --> 11:05.264
And say the magical words;

11:05.364 --> 11:06.332
Hullabaloo!

11:08.968 --> 11:10.202
Phenomenal.

11:10.302 --> 11:11.437
Eh Cedric?

11:12.371 --> 11:13.506
Sure is.

11:13.606 --> 11:14.840
I'll wait till you
get cleaned up,

11:14.940 --> 11:17.643
then we better get
over to the cafe.

11:19.378 --> 11:22.048
I invested a fortune
developing this vault,

11:22.148 --> 11:24.950
and it's got as many
holes as a Swiss cheese.

11:25.051 --> 11:28.054
I might as well install a
turnstile in the darn thing.

11:28.154 --> 11:31.390
But boss, we've been
over the entire vault

11:31.490 --> 11:34.660
and there's no way
Tromboni could've escaped.

11:34.760 --> 11:36.028
Brilliant observation.

11:36.128 --> 11:38.964
The fact remains he did escape,

11:39.065 --> 11:42.501
and there is nothing wrong
with Cedric's design.

11:42.601 --> 11:45.237
So it must be in
the construction,

11:45.337 --> 11:48.441
and you two bit truffle
snuffers built it!

11:48.541 --> 11:51.177
So you find out how
he escaped, capisce?

11:51.277 --> 11:52.178
Oh, yes sir.

11:52.278 --> 11:53.045
Right away, sir.

11:54.246 --> 11:57.750
Boy, the boss is on
the war path this time.

11:57.850 --> 11:59.552
Yeah, let's show the boss

11:59.652 --> 12:01.921
we can do something
right for a change.

12:02.021 --> 12:03.889
Well that shouldn't
be too hard,

12:03.989 --> 12:05.791
all we've gotta do
is find a way out

12:05.891 --> 12:07.960
of an impregnable vault.

12:10.396 --> 12:11.931
Seems solid here.

12:15.334 --> 12:16.502
Well, that's
everything Schaeffer.

12:16.602 --> 12:17.837
Wow!

12:17.937 --> 12:19.572
Hi Bert, Cedric,

12:19.672 --> 12:21.140
we're just about set here.

12:21.240 --> 12:22.708
How's the coin
trick coming along?

12:22.808 --> 12:25.277
Oh fine, just fine.

12:25.377 --> 12:27.480
Wow, look at all
this great stuff.

12:29.115 --> 12:31.884
Mr. Tromboni, actually,
I've been working

12:31.984 --> 12:34.053
on a couple of
zingers for the show.

12:34.153 --> 12:34.920
Really?

12:35.020 --> 12:36.021
Watch this;

12:37.423 --> 12:40.025
And now, out of nowhere.

12:44.463 --> 12:46.432
Bert, are you okay?

12:46.532 --> 12:48.934
Oh, thanks Mr. Tromboni.

12:49.034 --> 12:50.703
I guess one got stuck.

12:50.803 --> 12:52.705
Bert, don't do these things

12:52.805 --> 12:55.141
unless you know exactly
what you're doing.

12:55.241 --> 12:56.642
It's dangerous.

12:56.742 --> 12:58.944
There's plenty of time to learn
that one when you're ready.

12:59.044 --> 13:00.713
I'm sorry, Mr. Tromboni.

13:00.813 --> 13:04.083
It's just that I wanna
skip the penny ante stuff

13:04.183 --> 13:06.852
and move on to major illusions.

13:06.952 --> 13:09.455
I really think
they are my forte.

13:09.555 --> 13:11.957
Bert, practice with the coin

13:12.057 --> 13:15.427
until you can do it
perfectly, then we'll move on.

13:15.528 --> 13:18.898
Bert, would you mind putting
some of these boxes away?

13:18.998 --> 13:21.467
Mr. Tromboni and I are
heading for the train station

13:21.567 --> 13:23.536
to pick up the
rest of his stuff.

13:23.636 --> 13:24.703
Sure Schaeffer.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.105
Cheer up Bert,

13:26.205 --> 13:29.475
Mr. Tromboni's not
trying to discourage you.

13:29.575 --> 13:32.578
He just wants you to be
as good as him one day.

13:32.678 --> 13:36.081
So keep practicing,
you'll get the hang of it.

13:36.182 --> 13:37.716
Oh yeah, sure.

13:37.817 --> 13:41.387
You couldn't play a guitar
first time you picked it up.

13:41.487 --> 13:43.923
It's the same with magic.

13:44.023 --> 13:45.958
I'll see you later, okay Bert?

13:46.058 --> 13:48.527
Yeah, thanks Cedric.

13:48.627 --> 13:51.397
Hey, thanks Broo.

13:51.497 --> 13:54.133
Yeah, Cedric's right.

13:54.233 --> 13:58.404
A little practice and I'll be
disappearing all over the map.

Darn!

15:22.121 --> 15:24.056
Hmm, what's this?

15:25.357 --> 15:27.993
Broo, do you
know what this is?

15:28.093 --> 15:32.431
The most death defying
escape trick ever!

15:32.531 --> 15:35.868
Tromboni's world
famous water trap.

15:38.103 --> 15:39.204
There's no way

15:39.305 --> 15:41.774
Tromboni could have
gotten out through here.

15:41.874 --> 15:44.176
It's only a light socket.

15:47.680 --> 15:48.747
Well, that does it.

15:48.847 --> 15:51.250
We've poked and prodded
every square inch

15:51.350 --> 15:53.652
of this vault, and nothing!

15:53.752 --> 15:58.223
I was watching an old rerun
of "Pignum PI" last night,

15:58.324 --> 16:00.859
and he was locked in
an escape proof room.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.027
How did he get out?

16:03.228 --> 16:05.698
Well I don't know, I
didn't watch the end,

16:05.798 --> 16:07.666
but I did tape it.

16:07.766 --> 16:08.834
Well, let's watch it.

16:08.934 --> 16:11.403
Maybe we can pick up a clue.

16:11.503 --> 16:13.105
Yeah, I'll just
lock up the vault.

16:13.205 --> 16:14.039
Hey stop!

16:16.475 --> 16:17.509
Oh, darn it!

16:17.609 --> 16:19.345
That was the time lock.

16:19.445 --> 16:20.346
Drats!

16:20.446 --> 16:22.114
Hey, no problem.

16:22.214 --> 16:26.885
I'll just leave this note
which explains everything.

16:28.821 --> 16:29.989
Ah, don't worry about it Broo.

16:30.089 --> 16:31.724
I just wanna have a look.

16:31.824 --> 16:35.995
Ha, you'd figure there'd be
some kind of trick to this.

16:36.095 --> 16:36.929
Whoa!

16:38.497 --> 16:41.700
Oh great, I'm gonna
look really stupid

16:41.800 --> 16:43.902
when Tromboni sees this.

16:46.472 --> 16:47.840
Broo, help!

16:47.940 --> 16:48.841
Get me outta here!

16:48.941 --> 16:50.909
Stop the water!

16:51.010 --> 16:54.246
Broo, get help
before it's too late!

16:55.748 --> 16:57.649
This is the last
of it, Schaeffer.

16:59.118 --> 17:00.185
Something's
wrong, let's go.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.455
Bert, how do we open it?

17:03.555 --> 17:05.758
There's no time, stand back!

17:08.427 --> 17:10.562
Bert, say something!

17:15.300 --> 17:19.405
Oh, now I see why it's
called the water trap.

17:19.505 --> 17:22.107
Bert, you almost
killed yourself.

17:22.207 --> 17:25.878
How could you be so stupid?

17:26.745 --> 17:28.914
I'm sorry, Mr. Tromboni.

17:29.014 --> 17:29.882
I thought...

17:29.982 --> 17:31.650
You didn't think.

17:31.750 --> 17:33.786
You didn't at all.

17:33.886 --> 17:36.288
I've been trying to tell
you to stick to the basics,

17:36.388 --> 17:38.590
the rest will come, but...

17:40.059 --> 17:42.428
Come on Bert,
let's get you home.

17:44.229 --> 17:46.331
Move it, you bumbling bruins!

17:46.432 --> 17:49.068
Time's running out for my boys.

17:49.168 --> 17:50.736
Pop, what are you doing?

17:50.836 --> 17:52.538
They left this note.

17:52.638 --> 17:53.839
It's all my fault.

17:53.939 --> 17:57.876
"Dear boss, so far
no luck breaking out,

17:57.976 --> 18:00.512
but there's one
thing left to try.

18:00.612 --> 18:04.116
Hoping we find the answer
before it's too late.

18:04.216 --> 18:07.352
We remain yours, the boys."

18:08.687 --> 18:11.557
And this is all I've
got to remember them by,

18:11.657 --> 18:13.258
a crushed hat.

18:13.358 --> 18:16.328
Oh, those dear, brave boys.

18:16.428 --> 18:18.897
Stand back, I'll go in first.

18:18.997 --> 18:21.133
This won't be pretty.

18:21.233 --> 18:22.234
What's happening here?

18:22.334 --> 18:23.802
You've wrecked the vault.

18:23.902 --> 18:25.771
What are you three
doing out here?

18:25.871 --> 18:27.573
You're supposed to be in there.

18:27.673 --> 18:30.042
Oh, sorry boss.

18:30.142 --> 18:33.112
But you see Pignum
PI was trapped

18:33.212 --> 18:34.980
in this escape
proof room, you see?

18:38.317 --> 18:42.588
And then he slipped the
lock with a credit card.

18:42.688 --> 18:46.125
Well, it probably wouldn't
work anyway, huh boss?

18:50.028 --> 18:52.131
Ah, come on Bert.

18:52.231 --> 18:53.165
Come to the show.

18:53.265 --> 18:54.766
I told you I wasn't coming.

18:54.867 --> 18:57.503
Now get going or you'll
be late for the show.

18:58.670 --> 19:00.639
It's me Bert, Tromboni.

19:01.507 --> 19:02.808
Do you mind if I come in?

19:02.908 --> 19:05.911
Well, there's nothing
stopping you but a closed door.

19:06.011 --> 19:08.180
Giving up on
magic already, Bert?

19:08.280 --> 19:09.548
Yeah, I guess

19:10.716 --> 19:12.217
You didn't give
it much of a chance.

19:12.317 --> 19:13.418
Sure I did.

19:13.519 --> 19:16.121
But when I was caught
in the water trap

19:16.221 --> 19:18.590
I knew I couldn't
do the impossible.

19:18.690 --> 19:21.093
Nothing's impossible, Bert.

19:21.193 --> 19:22.761
If you believe, you can do it.

19:22.861 --> 19:24.263
Yeah, well there's
a big difference

19:24.363 --> 19:27.599
between believing you can do
something and really doing it.

19:27.699 --> 19:28.967
Ah, what's this?

19:29.067 --> 19:29.801
Huh?

19:29.902 --> 19:30.702
Catch.

19:31.937 --> 19:33.939
Do you believe I just did that?

19:34.039 --> 19:36.975
Well, I saw it,
so I guess I, uh...

19:37.075 --> 19:38.210
Yeah, I believe it.

19:38.310 --> 19:40.245
Then you can do it too,

19:41.213 --> 19:43.148
and I'll show you how.

19:43.248 --> 19:46.351
But you must promise never to
reveal how the trick is done,

19:46.451 --> 19:49.888
one magician to another.

19:49.988 --> 19:52.357
I promise.

19:52.457 --> 19:56.328
Now, let's
do the impossible.

19:58.497 --> 20:00.599
Wow, I did it!

20:00.699 --> 20:02.868
That's magic.

20:04.536 --> 20:06.638
Sometimes it's
hard to tell the difference

20:06.738 --> 20:09.274
between what's real
and what isn't.

20:09.374 --> 20:11.109
But as Bert Raccoon found out,

20:11.210 --> 20:15.714
nothing is impossible, if
you work hard enough for it.

20:15.814 --> 20:17.749
Ladies and gentlemen!

20:19.184 --> 20:23.822
The Great Tromboni will now
try to escape the water trap!

20:25.057 --> 20:30.062
Will he succeed or
will he, will he...

20:30.796 --> 20:31.697
Oh.

20:31.797 --> 20:34.967
Uh-oh.

20:36.235 --> 20:39.504
Thank you, ladies
and gentlemen!

20:39.605 --> 20:43.875
And now, my new student
will demonstrate his ability

20:43.976 --> 20:47.212
with what we magicians
call, close magic.

20:50.916 --> 20:52.050
Hocus pocus!

20:53.085 --> 20:53.885
Kalamazoo!

20:56.021 --> 20:57.155
Huh?

21:01.260 --> 21:04.596
A true spectacular
show, wasn't it Mr. Sneer?

21:05.897 --> 21:07.032
Terrific.

21:07.132 --> 21:09.568
Anyway, you'll
be pleased to hear

21:09.668 --> 21:13.138
I have decided to purchase
one of your vaults.

21:14.273 --> 21:15.907
But Tromboni got out of it.

21:16.008 --> 21:21.013
My dear Mr. Sneer,
surely you are aware

21:22.180 --> 21:24.650
that magic is the
art of illusion.

21:26.218 --> 21:30.722
What you see is not
necessarily what happens.

21:30.822 --> 21:33.325
Can I expect delivery
of the vault tomorrow?

21:33.425 --> 21:34.393
Sure, Knox.

21:34.493 --> 21:35.727
But what you saw

21:35.827 --> 21:39.331
is not necessarily what
you're going to get.
