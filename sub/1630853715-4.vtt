because I don't think you'll
find this little tasty piece

08:54.166 --> 08:56.638
while antiquing in Connecticut.

08:56.672 --> 08:59.076
Note the cobalt blue glaze.

08:59.109 --> 09:01.080
The white base.

09:01.113 --> 09:02.517
And use of porcelain interior.

09:02.550 --> 09:03.752
-Ja.
-Ja.

09:03.786 --> 09:05.690
NADJA:
I literally

09:05.723 --> 09:09.129
just grabbed this from Nandor's
room before I left the house.

09:09.163 --> 09:11.668
Now, what do your books
tell you about fairies?

09:11.702 --> 09:15.576
Well, fairies are pretty little
women that can fly around,

09:15.610 --> 09:17.145
and they live in mushrooms.

09:17.179 --> 09:18.481
Really? A likely story.

09:18.515 --> 09:19.751
What do we have here?

09:19.784 --> 09:21.588
A rancid pail of garbage.

09:21.622 --> 09:22.857
(coughing)

09:22.890 --> 09:24.527
(groans)
Hello, my beauties.

09:24.561 --> 09:26.097
-Laszlo!
-Laszlo!
-You're looking...

09:26.130 --> 09:27.567
(coughs)
healthy.

09:27.600 --> 09:28.636
Yeah, we've been eating garbage.

09:28.669 --> 09:31.173
Yeah. Love to chat, but, uh...

09:31.207 --> 09:32.442
got things to do.

09:32.476 --> 09:34.681
Enjoy your pile of shit.

09:34.714 --> 09:37.319
-Fuck off. Close the lid.
-Yeah, fucking close it.
-Yeah, yeah, well, I am gonna.

09:37.352 --> 09:38.656
-I just said that, didn't I?
-Stop talking.
Fucking close the lid.

09:38.689 --> 09:40.526
Fucking... Whoa.

09:41.828 --> 09:43.164
Real fairies.

09:43.197 --> 09:45.435
Well, go on, then.

09:45.468 --> 09:47.105
-(chuckles)
-They smelled like shit.

09:47.139 --> 09:48.642
-Oh, wicker baskets.
I love these!
-No.

09:48.676 --> 09:51.147
You don't need any more
wicker bask... Oh! Sorry.

09:51.180 --> 09:55.121
(sniffs) What human
dare mingle amongst us?

09:55.155 --> 09:57.326
-(growls)
-Uh, I'm not a human.

09:57.359 --> 09:58.495
Um...

09:58.529 --> 09:59.497
I'm an orc.

09:59.531 --> 10:02.402
(sniffing)

10:02.436 --> 10:04.874
-My mistake. Have a good one.
-Yeah.

10:04.908 --> 10:06.778
Thank you.

10:06.812 --> 10:08.882
Do I really look
that much like an orc?

10:08.916 --> 10:10.653
(cheering, clamoring)
-RINGMASTER: All right!

10:10.686 --> 10:12.590
Excellent. You will love this!

10:12.624 --> 10:14.694
-What, what is this?
-This is the familiar fights!

10:14.728 --> 10:17.366
-Wait, what?
-I haven't been
to one of these in ages.

10:17.399 --> 10:19.470
RINGMASTER:
And another sort of weak,

10:19.504 --> 10:21.307
flailing blow to the paunch.

10:21.340 --> 10:23.478
Neither of these two
in any condition to be fighting.

10:23.512 --> 10:26.551
Basically, a vampire will say,
"I have the toughest familiar."

10:26.585 --> 10:27.887
And then another vampire
will be like,

10:27.920 --> 10:29.924
"No, my familiar
is even tougher."

10:29.958 --> 10:32.597
And then they get the familiars
to fight each other,

10:32.630 --> 10:35.135
and whichever familiar kicks the
shit out of the other familiar,

10:35.168 --> 10:36.470
he is the winner.

10:36.505 --> 10:37.840
That sounds absolutely terrible.

10:37.874 --> 10:39.310
VAMPIRE:
Crush his bones! Yeah!

10:39.343 --> 10:40.513
RINGMASTER:
Look at him go.

10:40.546 --> 10:42.617
That's got to not
hurt that much.

10:42.650 --> 10:45.155
Oh, yeah. I think
we should break the arm.

10:45.188 --> 10:46.525
Break his arm!

10:46.558 --> 10:47.927
-GUILLERMO: Don't break his arm.
-RINGMASTER: Oh!

10:47.960 --> 10:49.229
NANDOR:
That's nothing. In the old days,

10:49.263 --> 10:51.233
they used to tear the head off.

10:51.267 --> 10:53.438
What are we thinking, folks?
Should we do the head?

10:53.471 --> 10:55.543
-Oh, great, they're still
doing that. Yes!
-Oh, no.

10:55.576 --> 10:57.412
-No, shouldn't do the head.
-ALL (chanting):
Head! Head! Head! Head!

10:57.446 --> 11:00.418
Head! Head! Head!
Head! Head! Head!

11:00.452 --> 11:01.855
Head! Head! Head!

11:01.888 --> 11:04.794
Head! Head! Head! Head!
Head! Head! Head...

11:04.828 --> 11:06.263
I think I want to do the head.

11:06.297 --> 11:07.800
-Yay!
-Head! Head! Head! Head!

11:07.834 --> 11:10.806
(cheering, clamoring)

11:10.840 --> 11:12.643
Give it up for our new familiar

11:12.677 --> 11:14.681
champion, this
piece of shit right here.

11:14.714 --> 11:16.651
How are you supporting this?
It's so wrong in so many ways.

11:16.685 --> 11:18.287
You're right, it is.

11:18.321 --> 11:20.291
'Cause you could take
any of these guys.

11:20.325 --> 11:22.229
-That's besides the point.
-WARLOCK: Hey!

11:22.262 --> 11:24.601
This vampire here thinks
that his familiar

11:24.634 --> 11:26.671
can beat any of our familiars!

11:26.705 --> 11:29.276
(laughter, clamoring)

11:29.309 --> 11:30.746
-Prove it!
-Take off that tailcoat.

11:30.780 --> 11:32.517
-Yes, okay,
let's do it, come on.
-No.

11:32.550 --> 11:33.886
I'm not gonna do it.
I'm not doing it.

11:33.919 --> 11:35.556
-Come on, let's do it.
-I'm not...

11:35.589 --> 11:37.493
-doing it.
-Right.

11:37.527 --> 11:38.829
Uh, no, no.

11:38.862 --> 11:41.300
My familiar will not
be fighting tonight.

11:41.333 --> 11:42.870
(crowd booing)

11:42.904 --> 11:44.641
Boring!

11:44.674 --> 11:47.513
Why? Is the little guy scared?

11:47.547 --> 11:49.918
-No!
-No, Master...

11:49.951 --> 11:51.822
the only thing
my familiar is scared of

11:51.855 --> 11:53.892
is beating all of your familiars

11:53.926 --> 11:57.466
all at once, 'cause that's
how tough my familiar is.

11:57.500 --> 11:58.802
-(laughter)
-VAMPIRE: Keep dreaming!

11:58.836 --> 11:59.838
RINGMASTER:
Oh, them's fighting words.

11:59.871 --> 12:01.373
Why did you say that?

12:01.407 --> 12:02.610
They insulted you, Guillermo.

12:02.643 --> 12:04.748
And insulting you
is insulting me.

12:04.781 --> 12:06.484
It is a matter of honor now.

12:06.518 --> 12:08.287
-Okay, he wants in!
-RINGMASTER: He wants in! Oh!

12:08.321 --> 12:09.758
-He's gonna get it!
-(cheering, clamoring)

12:09.791 --> 12:10.893
NANDOR:
You're gonna get it.

12:10.926 --> 12:12.830
What's your name, little buddy?

12:12.864 --> 12:14.701
-No one gives a shit.
(laughs) Let's fight.
-(cheering)

12:22.449 --> 12:23.752
NADJA:
So, my trading
is going very well.

12:23.786 --> 12:25.355
To the Valkyries I gave

12:25.388 --> 12:26.958
the vase, and then they gave me

12:26.992 --> 12:28.829
their rarest delicacy--

12:28.862 --> 12:30.900
the little meatballs
in the brown water.

12:30.933 --> 12:34.006
I don't know why
Valkyries sell meatballs

12:34.039 --> 12:36.477
and furniture,
but I'm not going to criticize

12:36.511 --> 12:38.047
the ways of other cultures.

12:38.080 --> 12:39.316
The little tiny meatballs,

12:39.349 --> 12:40.553
I traded with the Imps,

12:40.586 --> 12:42.623
'cause the Imps love tiny foods.

12:42.657 --> 12:44.794
Thanks, guys.

12:44.828 --> 12:46.464
It's a comedy T-shirt!

12:46.498 --> 12:48.869
I just know that
there's going to be someone

12:48.902 --> 12:50.906
who very much wants
to trade for this.

12:50.940 --> 12:52.442
NANDOR:
You got this, Guillermo!

12:52.476 --> 12:53.679
(shouting, clamoring)

12:53.712 --> 12:55.950
Just hit him! Just hit him!

12:55.983 --> 12:58.589
RINGMASTER:
That's got to be the Dodge of
the Night-- Dodge of the Night,

12:58.622 --> 13:00.458
brought to you
by Dodge Ram trucks.

13:00.493 --> 13:02.429
Check out the new 2022
Ram Pickup at your local...

13:02.462 --> 13:03.899
Look, I don't want
to hurt you, okay?

13:03.932 --> 13:05.468
NANDOR:
Don't run away from him!

13:05.503 --> 13:07.005
Hit him!

13:07.038 --> 13:08.542
RINGMASTER:
Whoa!

13:08.575 --> 13:10.078
That little fucker can move.

13:10.111 --> 13:11.848
Sorry. Are you okay?

13:11.882 --> 13:13.785
-That's my fucking guy!
-I didn't touch him.

13:13.819 --> 13:15.321
He did it to himself, okay?

13:15.355 --> 13:16.791
Zero blows taken, zero landed.

13:16.825 --> 13:18.562
They can't
all be bloodbaths, folks.

13:18.595 --> 13:21.033
But we have ourselves

13:21.066 --> 13:23.639
-a new winner-- this guy!
-(crowd booing)
-NANDOR: Yes! Suck it!

13:23.672 --> 13:25.576
-Suck it!
-RINGMASTER: Let's have

13:25.609 --> 13:27.312
another fight.
Hopefully he dies.

13:28.447 --> 13:30.018
(indistinct chatter)

13:30.051 --> 13:32.455
LASZLO:
Now, my point is, sometimes

13:32.489 --> 13:34.761
grownups lie to children
when the truth

13:34.794 --> 13:36.765
is too horrifying for them.

13:36.798 --> 13:39.336
-For instance,
that Pinocchio there.
-Whoa.

13:39.369 --> 13:41.842
LASZLO:
See his nose-- don't stare--
it's just a medical condition.

13:41.875 --> 13:43.846
-It's got bugger all
to do with lying.
-Oh.

13:43.879 --> 13:46.585
-And as far as I know,
he was never a puppet.
-Okay.

13:46.618 --> 13:48.956
-Behind us, see those
garden gnomes?
-Yeah.

13:48.989 --> 13:51.628
-Well, they're real.
Think they look happy?
-COLIN: I guess.

13:51.661 --> 13:53.464
They're not.
They're shit scared.

13:53.499 --> 13:56.003
-You stare at them, they freeze.
-That's sad.

13:56.036 --> 13:58.407
And sometimes grownups
lie to children

13:58.441 --> 14:00.579
-'cause the truth
is just so boring.
-Okay.

14:00.613 --> 14:03.552
-Now, you've read The Emperor's
New Clothes, right?
-Uh-huh.

14:03.585 --> 14:04.988
Well, here's one now.

14:05.021 --> 14:06.892
So, he's just
a common German nudist.

14:06.925 --> 14:09.697
And behind him is a witch.

14:09.731 --> 14:11.968
They're very real,
and one day, they'll fight

14:12.002 --> 14:13.805
-to get hold of your semen.
-Oh.

14:13.839 --> 14:16.143
-But not in a fun way.
-What's semen?

14:16.176 --> 14:17.847
(shouting, clamoring)

14:17.880 --> 14:20.653
Hit him! Hit him!

14:20.686 --> 14:22.557
-I'm not gonna hit him, okay?
-(whistling, clamoring)

14:22.590 --> 14:24.661
Okay, that was really close
to my face.

14:24.694 --> 14:26.865
Come on, don't play
with our food.

14:26.898 --> 14:28.835
For me, just him just once!

14:28.869 --> 14:32.442
And another high-flying
capoeira kick that does nothing.

14:32.475 --> 14:33.845
Look, we don't
have to do this, okay?

14:33.879 --> 14:35.749
We're both familiars.

14:35.783 --> 14:37.452
-So why don't we just sha...
-RINGMASTER: Smoke in the face.

14:37.485 --> 14:38.922
-That's got to hurt.
-Don't let him do that, hey!

14:38.956 --> 14:41.528
Whoa! Oh! What the...

14:41.561 --> 14:44.032
I'm just trying to talk to you
like a regular person.

14:44.066 --> 14:46.504
You're being kind
of a fucking dick, okay?

14:46.538 --> 14:48.474
-Yeah, now hit him!
-Look, we don't have
to do this. We're both human.

14:48.508 --> 14:50.879
-Come on!
-Okay! Are you okay?!

14:50.913 --> 14:52.850
You're dead!
Finish him! Hit him!

14:52.883 --> 14:54.887
Now it seems like the hot one's
running out of steam.

14:54.921 --> 14:56.591
Are you okay?

14:56.625 --> 14:58.194
Stop talking to him
and just hit him, Guillermo!

14:58.227 --> 15:00.098
You know, nowadays there's
really no reason to smoke.

15:00.131 --> 15:01.968
NANDOR:
He's going down! Hit him!

15:02.002 --> 15:03.471
RINGMASTER:
Now our familiar's
having an asthma attack.

15:03.505 --> 15:05.509
-Is there a doctor?
-Ay...

15:05.542 --> 15:07.479
-Is someone a doctor? Somebody?
-(shouting, jeering)

15:07.513 --> 15:08.481
We're not hurting anyone to...

15:08.515 --> 15:10.151
Aw, fuck.

15:10.184 --> 15:11.688
And we have ourselves
a winner again.

15:11.721 --> 15:12.924
NANDOR:
Suck it!

15:12.957 --> 15:14.192
-You suck it! You suck it!
-Yay.

15:14.226 --> 15:16.531
He won again. Yay.

15:16.564 --> 15:18.067
It's this way.

15:18.100 --> 15:20.806
So, the night market
kind of goes on forever.

15:20.839 --> 15:22.677
-Afternoon.
-(low growling)

15:22.710 --> 15:25.849
It's sort of infinite
and it has dark, dirtier sides.

15:25.883 --> 15:27.452
Bit like me.

15:27.485 --> 15:30.024
Nice place.

15:30.058 --> 15:32.797
Just gonna take a little
look around or whatever.

15:32.830 --> 15:35.468
Small skull, nice.

15:35.502 --> 15:37.640
(clears her throat)

15:37.673 --> 15:39.443
(squeaking)

15:39.476 --> 15:41.581
You got some nice stuff.

15:41.615 --> 15:44.152
Not what I'm
looking for, though.

15:44.186 --> 15:46.758
I think what I'm looking for...

15:46.791 --> 15:50.465
might be something that you
might put under the counter.

15:50.499 --> 15:52.703
How do I know
you're not with some form

15:52.737 --> 15:54.841
of law enforcement?

15:54.874 --> 15:57.145
Hey! Fuck you, man.

15:57.178 --> 15:59.717
Would a cop have this?

15:59.751 --> 16:02.489
A piece of clothing
with a very misogynistic joke

16:02.523 --> 16:04.459
that makes a complete mockery

16:04.494 --> 16:06.798
of common traffic safety laws.

16:06.831 --> 16:08.067
(imitates explosion)

16:08.100 --> 16:10.873
(mouthing)

16:10.906 --> 16:12.977
(laughing)

16:13.010 --> 16:15.783
-Huh? Huh?
-The bitch fell off.

16:15.816 --> 16:17.820
I think even my bitch
would get a kick out of that.

16:17.853 --> 16:19.089
Yeah, she would.

16:19.122 --> 16:21.594
All right,
you give me that shirt,

16:21.628 --> 16:23.598
I got what you're looking for.

16:23.632 --> 16:25.168
-I need eyes on it.
-All right.

16:25.201 --> 16:26.671
Keep your knickers on.

16:26.705 --> 16:28.140
Let me have a look down here.

16:28.174 --> 16:29.544
Here we go.

16:29.577 --> 16:31.581
I think, uh, this

16:31.614 --> 16:33.217
is up your alley.

16:33.250 --> 16:35.756
We have a deal!
Take the stupid shirt.

16:35.789 --> 16:37.158
-Yes!
-RINGMASTER: We got a winner.

16:37.192 --> 16:38.695
He stole her glasses
and she couldn't see.

16:38.729 --> 16:40.264
-Boring.
-(crowd jeering)

16:40.298 --> 16:41.901
Give me my glasses back.

16:41.935 --> 16:45.576
I'm gonna give
your glasses to your master.

16:45.609 --> 16:48.648
-Lot of jawboning going on.
-Okay?

16:48.682 --> 16:50.919
Here you go.
It was nice meeting you, okay?

16:50.953 --> 16:53.759
...a little less hot air,
but I present to you

16:53.792 --> 16:57.032
our new familiar champion,
this guy right here.

16:57.065 --> 16:59.302
Never caught his name,
never caught his name.

16:59.336 --> 17:01.708
And as a reward,

17:01.741 --> 17:03.812
what we all know
humans love most.

17:03.845 --> 17:05.682
Some dried-up dog food.

17:05.716 --> 17:07.052
They love that shit.

17:07.085 --> 17:09.256
They love it.
And now

17:09.289 --> 17:12.095
-it is time for our main event.
-Yes.

17:12.128 --> 17:15.034
-Our champion familiar versus...
-Oh, come on.

17:15.068 --> 17:17.172
our champion vampire,

17:17.205 --> 17:19.042
Gorgo the Murderer!

17:19.076 --> 17:20.946
-(cheering, clamoring)
-Look at him!

17:20.979 --> 17:22.983
I'm gonna murder you
so fucking hard.

17:23.017 --> 17:25.723
-RINGMASTER: Undefeated
when it comes to murder.
-Aah!

17:25.756 --> 17:27.860
Give us one moment.

17:27.893 --> 17:29.931
Murder him! Murder him...

17:29.964 --> 17:31.601
You shouldn't fight this guy.

17:31.634 --> 17:33.070
This is a guy that's gonna
rip your head clean off.

17:33.104 --> 17:35.041
Actually, he's not.
He's a vampire.

17:35.074 --> 17:36.845
And, remember,
I'm a vampire-killer.

17:36.878 --> 17:38.915
Oh, yes, I always forget that.

17:38.949 --> 17:40.586
Okay then, go kill him!
Go kill him!

17:40.619 --> 17:41.588
Go kill him! Go!

17:41.621 --> 17:42.823
Just one second.

17:42.857 --> 17:44.226
NANDOR:
Sorry, once second. What?

17:45.261 --> 17:47.298
What's gonna happen when a room
full of vampires sees

17:47.332 --> 17:49.871
a familiar kill a vampire
for the first time?

17:49.904 --> 17:51.708
Good point. Wait.

17:51.741 --> 17:53.177
I think I have an idea.

17:53.210 --> 17:55.716
-We leave?
-No.

17:55.749 --> 17:59.791
Vampires!

17:59.824 --> 18:01.160
Can I just...
Give me that.

18:01.193 --> 18:03.665
Vampires, a fight

18:03.698 --> 18:05.869
between this poor familiar...

18:05.903 --> 18:07.673
(cheering, clamoring)

18:07.706 --> 18:09.877
...my closest companion
for 13 years?

18:09.911 --> 18:11.948
-CROWD: Yeah!
-Against this

18:11.981 --> 18:14.620
ruthless vampire?

18:14.654 --> 18:16.223
This is sick! This is...

18:16.256 --> 18:18.628
Sorry. Can I just...

18:18.662 --> 18:20.833
Thank you. This is... Not you.

18:20.866 --> 18:22.202
This is sick!

18:22.235 --> 18:24.039
But you know what would

18:24.072 --> 18:25.776
be even more sick?

18:25.809 --> 18:28.080
-CROWD: What?
-A battle

18:28.114 --> 18:29.650
between him

18:29.684 --> 18:31.220
and me.

18:31.253 --> 18:32.823
(cheering, clamoring)

18:32.857 --> 18:34.259
Who wants to see me pulverize

18:34.292 --> 18:36.631
my closest companion
of 13 years?

18:36.664 --> 18:38.768
-Yeah!
-Who wants to see that?

18:38.802 --> 18:40.204
Kill your friend!

18:40.238 --> 18:43.912
Kill your friend!
Kill your friend...

18:43.945 --> 18:46.216
Right! I'm going
to kill my friend!

18:46.250 --> 18:48.087
Kill your friend!
Kill your friend!

18:53.164 --> 18:54.867
Oh, this isn't gonna take
very long, ladies and germs.

18:54.901 --> 18:56.403
Kill my friend.

18:56.436 --> 18:58.842
Kill your friend--
that's what we all want to see.

18:58.875 --> 19:00.712
All right, here we go, baby!

19:00.746 --> 19:02.817
-Circling...
-Kill your friend!
Kill your friend...

19:02.850 --> 19:05.722
-circling...
-I'm not gonna hurt you,
Guillermo.

19:05.756 --> 19:07.325
I'm just gonna take you out
with one punch,

19:07.358 --> 19:08.995
and then carry your body away.

19:09.029 --> 19:10.799
Don't you think we should put on

19:10.833 --> 19:12.202
a little bit of a show
for them, at least?

19:12.235 --> 19:14.239
It's implausible
that it would take any longer

19:14.272 --> 19:16.410
than five seconds
for me to beat you.

19:16.443 --> 19:19.382
Is it, though?
I mean, remember last time?

19:19.416 --> 19:21.688
-(grunts)
-Hey!

19:21.721 --> 19:24.125
Please, I let you win
to teach you a lesson.

19:24.159 --> 19:26.831
And, anyway, you did cheat
just a little bit.

19:26.865 --> 19:28.367
I didn't cheat.

19:28.400 --> 19:29.737
You did just a little bit.

19:29.770 --> 19:31.173
I didn't have to.

19:31.206 --> 19:33.143
-RINGMASTER:
Come on, this is boring!
-Okay...

19:33.177 --> 19:35.348
little man, bring your best.

19:35.381 --> 19:37.686
(crowd cheering, clamoring)

19:37.720 --> 19:40.792
RINGMASTER:
Okay, looks like
the little guy's voguing now.

19:40.826 --> 19:42.796
Whoa!

19:42.830 --> 19:45.268
We got stakes! We got stakes.

19:45.301 --> 19:47.372
-You cheeky little shit!
-Oh, the stakes are high.

19:47.405 --> 19:50.779
-Come here!
-Oh, we got ourselves a fight,
ladies and gentlemen.

19:50.812 --> 19:53.317
We got ourselves a fight.

19:53.350 --> 19:55.054
Come on, kill your friend.

19:55.087 --> 19:56.991
Oh, and we're doing flips...

19:57.025 --> 19:58.962
He killed my friend.

19:58.995 --> 20:00.131
-What the fuck?
-That was a mistake.

20:00.164 --> 20:01.333
Stop throwing stakes.

20:01.366 --> 20:03.370
-It's rude.
-Keep going, or...

20:03.404 --> 20:05.909
Eh.

20:05.943 --> 20:08.180
RINGMASTER:
Holy shit, he's
Phantom Menacing.

20:08.214 --> 20:10.484
Lot of flash.

20:10.519 --> 20:12.856
Regular Darth Maul, Jr.
over here.

20:12.890 --> 20:15.796
I call him Darth Small.

20:15.829 --> 20:17.332
-Whoa!
-Aah!

20:17.365 --> 20:19.002
RINGMASTER:
Boom goes the dynamite!

20:19.035 --> 20:20.939
I am the winner!

20:20.973 --> 20:22.275
RINGMASTER:
Uhp, and look, and there
he goes. He's on the run.

20:22.308 --> 20:23.845
That's right,
you don't fuck with me!

20:23.878 --> 20:25.314
RINGMASTER:
Dumb move to run from a vampire.

20:25.348 --> 20:27.485
-I am the winner!
-Then again, he is a familiar.

20:27.519 --> 20:30.091
And they're known
for being dumb pieces of shit.

20:30.124 --> 20:31.794
Uh, your friend's up there.

20:31.828 --> 20:33.063
The fuck?

20:33.097 --> 20:35.234
There he is, go! Kill him!

20:35.268 --> 20:37.773
-Murder him!
-Oh.

20:37.806 --> 20:40.244
That's nice.
How much for this one?

20:40.278 --> 20:41.781
(swords clanging)

20:41.814 --> 20:43.417
RINGMASTER:
It's getting slicey.

20:43.450 --> 20:45.789
We got a swordfight.

20:45.822 --> 20:47.425
Getting a little edgy.
Whoa!

20:47.458 --> 20:49.897
Collateral damage, but we love
to see it, folks.

20:49.931 --> 20:51.400
-Look what you made me do!
-What?

20:51.433 --> 20:54.540
Guillermo, you're really
starting to piss me off!

20:54.573 --> 20:56.410
-RINGMASTER: Now he's swinging.
-GUILLERMO: It was
your idea, remember?!

20:56.443 --> 20:58.380
-Get back here!
-GUILLERMO: This is your plan!

20:58.414 --> 21:01.019
-Stop hiding behind Greg!
-GUILLERMO: Why are you
mad at me?

21:01.053 --> 21:03.290
-NANDOR: Sorry, can I...
-Is this still part of the game?

21:03.324 --> 21:05.361
-Fuck you!
-RINGMASTER: Now we're
getting somewhere.

21:05.394 --> 21:08.300
Okay, that fucking hurts,
you fucking dick!

21:08.334 --> 21:09.971
-(grunting)
-NANDOR: Ah, you're disarmed!

21:12.408 --> 21:15.114
-(grunting)
-Get back.

21:15.147 --> 21:17.485
-Aah!
-RINGMASTER: Shit.

21:17.519 --> 21:19.957
I guess Peter Pan can't fly.

21:19.991 --> 21:21.961
Oopsies.

21:21.995 --> 21:24.399
RINGMASTER:
A predictable end, but an end

21:24.432 --> 21:26.036
-nonetheless.
-Yeah!

21:26.069 --> 21:28.474
-Are you not entertained?
-I killed my friend!

21:28.508 --> 21:30.244
I killed my friend!

21:30.277 --> 21:32.248
I may have killed my friend.

21:32.281 --> 21:34.285
RINGMASTER:
Oh, shit! He's got a shovel!

21:34.319 --> 21:36.824
Hey-oh!

21:36.858 --> 21:39.095
(cheering, clamoring)

21:39.129 --> 21:42.101
Finish him! Finish him!

21:42.135 --> 21:44.372
Finish him!

21:44.406 --> 21:46.544
Finish him! Finish him!

21:46.577 --> 21:48.581
They are right, Guillermo.

21:48.615 --> 21:50.585
Finish me.

21:50.619 --> 21:53.858
-Finish him! Finish him!
-RINGMASTER: Finish
that motherfucker!

21:53.892 --> 21:55.394
NANDOR:
Finish me!

21:55.428 --> 21:57.332
What kind of a vampire am I

21:57.365 --> 21:59.937
if cannot even defeat
my own familiar?!

21:59.970 --> 22:01.507
I'm not gonna
finish anyone, okay?

22:01.541 --> 22:03.511
I'm gonna let you win.

22:03.545 --> 22:06.551
I don't really want to kill you,
but if it is the only way,

22:06.584 --> 22:09.122
-then thank you.
-What? No.

22:09.155 --> 22:10.859
I don't mean really kill me.

22:10.892 --> 22:12.295
Just, like, pretend to snap
my neck or something,

22:12.328 --> 22:14.099
so we can get
the hell out of here.

22:14.132 --> 22:15.535
-That's a much better plan.
-RINGMASTER: I want to see

22:15.569 --> 22:17.138
-the blood!
-Ready?
-Ready.

22:17.171 --> 22:20.077
(grunts) Hey!

22:20.111 --> 22:23.083
-(crowd cheering)
-RINGMASTER: Snap!
Oh! Oh, oh, oh!

22:23.117 --> 22:25.522
He's dead as a doornail.

22:25.555 --> 22:28.561
Dead as doornail,
ladies and gentlemen.

22:28.595 --> 22:31.501
We learned a lot tonight here
at familiar fights.

22:31.534 --> 22:33.437
A lot about friendship,
and how stupid

22:33.470 --> 22:35.241
and false and artificial it is.

22:35.274 --> 22:37.011
-You okay?
-RINGMASTER: Hey, folks,
make sure

22:37.045 --> 22:38.447
to take your familiar corpses
with you as you leave.

22:44.125 --> 22:46.463
One moment,
I'll be right with you, Xerxes.

22:46.497 --> 22:48.935
-(whispering)
-So...

22:48.968 --> 22:51.073
we went to the night market
last night.

22:51.106 --> 22:54.547
Oh, my, the night market,
what fun.

22:54.580 --> 22:57.018
-Mm.
-I already had plans last night,

22:57.051 --> 22:59.222
so it's a good thing
I didn't get invited.

22:59.255 --> 23:01.326
And, here, I got you a gift.

23:01.359 --> 23:04.533
It came with these weird vials
of whatever this is.

23:04.567 --> 23:07.438
I think I'll probably
just keep all of these.

23:07.472 --> 23:10.177
And you can use the box to store
your brooches or whatever.

23:10.211 --> 23:12.950
This is for me? This is so kind.

23:12.983 --> 23:15.221
I am very kind.
Very good boss.

23:15.254 --> 23:17.458
GUIDE:
I cannot remember the last time

23:17.493 --> 23:19.329
someone got me a gift.

23:19.362 --> 23:21.099
And I do have a lot of brooches.

23:21.133 --> 23:23.905
-I didn't think
anyone noticed...
-Oh!

23:23.938 --> 23:25.241
You have detected

23:25.274 --> 23:27.278
the sweet,
intoxicating scent of the...

23:27.311 --> 23:29.449
(inhales deeply)
Water Lily of The Nile.

23:29.482 --> 23:31.687
-Haven't you, Xerxes?
-Uh-oh.

23:31.721 --> 23:33.090
NADJA:
Water Lily

23:33.123 --> 23:34.159
of the Nile.

23:34.192 --> 23:35.261
That is what they call it.

23:35.294 --> 23:36.998
It's a medicinal flower.

23:37.031 --> 23:39.002
It's a narcotic
that the Egyptians

23:39.035 --> 23:41.072
used to bury
with their dead in order

23:41.106 --> 23:43.410
to help ease the sufferings
of the afterlife.

23:43.444 --> 23:45.982
And according
to the Compendium Narcoticum,

23:46.016 --> 23:48.621
-LASZLO:
Some third-rate cobbler...
-it is the only drug

23:48.655 --> 23:50.625
that helps with the pain
of being a wraith.

23:50.659 --> 23:52.261
Very hard to come by.

23:52.295 --> 23:54.065
And it is said

23:54.099 --> 23:56.537
that those little gobshites
will do anything for it.

23:57.539 --> 24:01.146
Do I have enough of these to
give to all of the wraiths? No.

24:01.179 --> 24:03.685
Do I have enough of these
to give to the one wraith

24:03.718 --> 24:06.223
who tells all the other wraiths
what to do?

24:06.256 --> 24:08.227
Maybe.

24:08.260 --> 24:11.233
I think that is probably
all I need.

24:11.266 --> 24:13.170
Don't you?!

24:13.203 --> 24:15.007
GUIDE:
He won't do it.

24:15.040 --> 24:16.644
Union solidarity
is a big deal to them.

24:16.677 --> 24:18.515
"We have a deal."

24:18.548 --> 24:20.484
There you go. Pleasure
doing business with you.

24:20.519 --> 24:22.121
That's how it's done.

24:23.423 --> 24:26.363
-(indistinct whispering)
-GUIDE:
I don't think they're happy.

24:26.396 --> 24:30.204
NADJA:
If they all vote,
he can overrule them, right?

24:30.237 --> 24:32.643
-What?
-(Guide gasps)

24:32.676 --> 24:34.012
GUIDE:
Oh!

24:34.045 --> 24:36.717
GUIDE:
Oh, no!

24:36.751 --> 24:38.755
Mm, shit, shit, shit.

24:38.788 --> 24:42.161
"Xerxes is no longer our leader.

24:42.195 --> 24:45.134
Also, he is dead."
Obviously.

24:45.167 --> 24:46.637
Fine! Fuck it!

24:46.671 --> 24:48.708
You can have Mondays off
with pay.

24:48.741 --> 24:50.244
And I will build you five

24:50.277 --> 24:52.114
new supply closets
for you to sleep in.

24:53.417 --> 24:55.287
-(groans)
-(chuckles)

24:55.321 --> 24:56.724
(spits)

24:56.757 --> 24:58.995
-Now get back to work!
-(indistinct whispers)

25:01.266 --> 25:03.003
There we go.

25:03.036 --> 25:04.573
I know you've had
a disappointing day,

25:04.607 --> 25:07.144
so no rehearsal tonight.

25:07.178 --> 25:09.583
Would you like me to read one
of your fairy stories to you?

25:09.617 --> 25:11.453
Uh, that's okay.
I-I don't think

25:11.486 --> 25:13.658
I want to read those anymore.

25:13.691 --> 25:15.795
Maybe, can you read me something

25:15.829 --> 25:18.333
from one of your real books
about real stuff?

25:18.367 --> 25:20.271
I thought you'd never ask.

25:20.304 --> 25:22.509
(laughs)

25:22.543 --> 25:25.414
One of my personal favorites.
Oh, yes.

25:25.447 --> 25:28.186
"The village of Holcomb stands

25:28.220 --> 25:31.494
"on the high
wheat plains of western Kansas,

25:31.527 --> 25:35.067
a lonesome area that other
Kansans call 'out there.'"

25:35.100 --> 25:37.338
-Are you still awake?
-Um, yeah.

25:37.371 --> 25:39.610
It gets very heavy
from here on in.
