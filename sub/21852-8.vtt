Okay, guys, it's November,

00:38.164 --> 00:39.665
and who can tell me
what that means?!

00:39.832 --> 00:41.417
Yes, Francis?

00:41.584 --> 00:44.211
It's time for
the Special Ed Science Fair!

00:44.378 --> 00:45.921
- Yea!
- Science fair!

00:46.088 --> 00:48.340
That's right! The Science Fair
is this weekend,

00:48.507 --> 00:49.967
and I know you are all
<i>very</i> excited to show

00:50.134 --> 00:51.761
the projects
you've been working on!

00:51.927 --> 00:53.262
- Yea!
- All right!

00:53.429 --> 00:54.055
Science Fair!

00:54.221 --> 00:55.765
This week, we'll be hearing
all about your projects,

00:55.931 --> 00:58.893
and first up we have
Nathan and Mimallah.

01:00.394 --> 01:02.646
For our science fair project,

01:02.813 --> 01:05.107
we will be showing
the destructive force

01:05.274 --> 01:08.486
of nature by simulating
a volcano!

01:08.652 --> 01:10.488
- Ooooh!
- Ooooh!

01:10.654 --> 01:13.074
With vinegar and baking soda,

01:13.240 --> 01:16.535
we will make this
papier-mâché volcano explode!

01:16.702 --> 01:17.995
Aaah!

01:18.162 --> 01:20.998
With the power and fury
of Mount Kilauea!

01:21.165 --> 01:24.835
Our science fair project
is sure to be a blast.

01:25.002 --> 01:27.463
Get it? A blast.

01:27.630 --> 01:29.673
All right, what do you
guys think of Nathan

01:29.840 --> 01:31.467
and Mimallah's
project idea?

01:31.634 --> 01:33.594
- Yay!
- Yay!

01:33.761 --> 01:35.137
We've done it, Mimsey.

01:35.304 --> 01:37.556
We're gonna win
the science fair for sure.

01:37.723 --> 01:39.934
And then every chick
in this school

01:40.101 --> 01:41.560
is gonna want to have
sex with us.

01:41.727 --> 01:44.563
Oh, gee, boss, I don't know
about sex with no chicken.

01:44.730 --> 01:46.357
Not <i>those</i> chicks, numbskull.

01:46.524 --> 01:48.234
I'm talking about bitches.

01:48.400 --> 01:50.945
You know what girls like?
They like winners.

01:51.112 --> 01:53.364
And when we win
the science fair,

01:53.531 --> 01:56.408
we're gonna be up to our ears
in pussy.

01:58.536 --> 02:00.371
Is it just me,
or are things around here

02:00.538 --> 02:01.664
getting worse and worse?

02:01.831 --> 02:03.332
It's definitely
not just you.

02:03.499 --> 02:06.168
I think everyone's is shock
that Heidi went back to Cartman.

02:06.335 --> 02:07.962
What keeps driving her
back to him?

02:08.129 --> 02:08.754
It's so weird.

02:08.921 --> 02:10.131
And she's so...

02:10.297 --> 02:12.133
Mean and angry these days.

02:12.299 --> 02:14.385
People change.
They say you become

02:14.552 --> 02:15.803
more and more like
the person you're with,

02:15.970 --> 02:18.055
and I guess it's
true with Heidi.

02:18.222 --> 02:20.349
Hey guys, wassup?

02:20.516 --> 02:21.809
Hey, Heidi.

02:21.976 --> 02:23.269
What are you guys
talking about?

02:23.435 --> 02:24.311
Nothing.

02:24.478 --> 02:25.187
Bullcrap, you're all

02:25.354 --> 02:26.480
talking about me again!

02:26.647 --> 02:27.523
'Cause you're
judgmental bitches.

02:27.690 --> 02:29.441
Eh.

02:29.608 --> 02:30.317
Heidi...

02:30.484 --> 02:31.777
Are you okay?

02:31.944 --> 02:34.029
It's just...
You look...

02:35.447 --> 02:37.283
I look what?

02:37.449 --> 02:38.868
You know,
you just look --

02:39.034 --> 02:40.202
What, I look fat?

02:40.369 --> 02:41.328
Is that what you wanna
say, Wendy?

02:41.495 --> 02:42.830
Fuck you, bitch.

02:42.997 --> 02:45.124
She's just concerned,
Heidi.

02:45.291 --> 02:46.834
Meh, myeh,
meh, meh, meh, Heidi.

02:47.001 --> 02:48.377
I'm just trying
to enjoy my lunch here.

02:48.544 --> 02:51.714
Can I do it without you guys
shitting all over me?

02:51.881 --> 02:53.007
All right good,
Timmy.

02:53.174 --> 02:54.842
Test 42-A is successful!

02:55.009 --> 02:56.302
Let's move on
to the next phase.

02:56.468 --> 02:58.137
Well, hello, gentlemen.

02:58.304 --> 02:59.513
Oh, hey, fellas.
We're doing great.

02:59.680 --> 03:00.890
Timmy!

03:01.056 --> 03:02.183
Thought we'd stop by
to see how

03:02.349 --> 03:04.393
your science fair project
was going.

03:04.560 --> 03:06.604
I thought we was comin'
to rub their faces

03:06.770 --> 03:08.314
in how good <i>our</i> science
fair project was, boss!

03:08.480 --> 03:10.566
Shut up, Mimsey!

03:10.733 --> 03:12.318
So, what are
you guys working on?

03:12.484 --> 03:13.527
Oh, it's fantastic.

03:13.694 --> 03:14.987
This year, Tim-Tim and I

03:15.154 --> 03:16.614
are doing our project
on water bears!

03:16.780 --> 03:18.908
Ohh, water bears.

03:19.074 --> 03:20.409
You hear that Mimsey?

03:20.576 --> 03:22.953
Like there's any such thing
as water bears.

03:23.120 --> 03:25.581
That blue Science Fair Ribbon
is as good as ours.

03:25.748 --> 03:27.791
Well, we gotta get back to
our lava volcano.

03:27.958 --> 03:31.045
Good luck finding your
water bears.

03:31.212 --> 03:32.630
Oh, would you like
to see them?

03:32.796 --> 03:34.256
Wha? What are you
talking about?

03:34.423 --> 03:35.883
Timmy and I have gathered
thousands of water bears.

03:36.050 --> 03:37.968
Take a look into
the microscope.

03:40.429 --> 03:42.973
Water bears are water-dwelling,
eight legged micro-animals.

03:43.140 --> 03:44.475
- Timmy!
- They are one of nature's

03:44.642 --> 03:46.018
most resilient animals.

03:46.185 --> 03:47.394
Studies have shown
they can survive lava

03:47.561 --> 03:49.396
and even the vacuum of space.

03:49.563 --> 03:51.649
What -- How --

03:51.815 --> 03:53.859
where the fuck did you
learn about these things?

03:54.026 --> 03:56.362
Where all good scientists
learn from -- Octonauts.

03:56.528 --> 03:57.988
Octonauts!

03:58.155 --> 03:59.490
Some scientists believe
the study of water bears

03:59.657 --> 04:00.866
is key to human survival.

04:01.033 --> 04:02.576
Aw, gee, that sounds
a lot better than

04:02.743 --> 04:04.954
a lava volcano,
huh, boss?

04:05.120 --> 04:06.705
Well not really,

04:06.872 --> 04:09.208
because a science fair
is supposed to be an experiment.

04:09.375 --> 04:11.460
I fail to see what
the experiment is here.

04:11.627 --> 04:13.587
Oh, that's easy! You see,
for the past several weeks,

04:13.754 --> 04:15.005
Tim-Tim and me have
been training the water bears

04:15.172 --> 04:16.840
to respond to different
sound waves.

04:17.007 --> 04:18.842
We've found that they respond
best to Taylor Swift.

04:19.009 --> 04:20.803
Hit it, Timmy.
♪ Oh, look what you made me do ♪

We still have some
training to do,

04:31.605 --> 04:33.357
but we're excited
about the results.

04:33.524 --> 04:35.150
I have to admit your lava
volcano is pretty great, too!

04:35.317 --> 04:37.319
Maybe we could tie
for first place.

04:40.447 --> 04:43.075
Come in.

04:43.242 --> 04:45.828
You wanted to see me,
Mr. Mackey?

04:45.995 --> 04:48.330
Oh, yes, Heidi! Uh,

04:48.497 --> 04:50.708
we just wanted to see
if you have transportation

04:50.874 --> 04:53.419
to the Special Ed Science Fair
this weekend or if you wanted us

04:53.585 --> 04:55.504
to set something up for you.

04:55.671 --> 04:58.048
What?

04:58.215 --> 05:00.676
Uh, Saturday
is the science fair,

05:00.843 --> 05:02.720
and you're the judge
for the competition.

05:02.886 --> 05:04.471
Judge a special needs
science fair?!

05:04.638 --> 05:06.015
Ugh, no, thanks.

05:06.181 --> 05:08.058
Well, Heidi is there a problem

05:08.225 --> 05:09.685
with you being the judge
this weekend?

05:09.852 --> 05:13.355
Uh, yeah, it's Saturday,
and I don't wanna be at skewl.

05:13.522 --> 05:16.150
But you're always the judge
of the Special Ed Science Fair

05:16.317 --> 05:18.444
because you're
our best science student.

05:18.610 --> 05:20.946
So, now I'm gonna be punished
by being forced to judge

05:21.113 --> 05:22.364
a bunch
of handicapped kids?!

05:22.531 --> 05:25.492
But -- M'kay. You see
the problem is that

05:25.659 --> 05:27.953
you volunteered last month,
Heidi.

05:28.120 --> 05:30.539
You said you wanted to do it,
M'kay.

05:30.706 --> 05:32.291
Well, how can you
expect students to commit

05:32.458 --> 05:34.126
to things a month
in advance?

05:34.293 --> 05:36.587
I don't even know what
I want for dinner <i>tonight!</i>

05:36.754 --> 05:38.130
Look, the kids have
worked really hard

05:38.297 --> 05:40.549
and have done some
amazing projects.

05:40.716 --> 05:43.260
You're gonna force me to
come to skew on a Saturday?!

05:43.427 --> 05:44.845
Heidi...

05:45.012 --> 05:47.139
Is everything all right?

05:47.306 --> 05:49.099
Oh, what are you gonna
call me fat now, too?

05:49.266 --> 05:51.018
It just so happens
I'm a vegan!

05:51.185 --> 05:52.978
Which means it's difficult
for me to get enough protein

05:53.145 --> 05:55.314
so my body doesn't burn fat,
it burns muscle,

05:55.481 --> 05:56.690
which makes it <i>look</i> like
I'm fat, but I'm actually

05:56.857 --> 05:59.985
way healthier than any of you!

06:00.152 --> 06:02.529
Heidi, you're judging
the Special Ed Science Fair

06:02.696 --> 06:03.530
this weekend.

06:03.697 --> 06:05.657
Aw, God damn it!

06:13.374 --> 06:14.792
Mimsey! Come on!

06:14.958 --> 06:16.001
Okay, Nathan!

06:16.168 --> 06:18.295
Shhhhh!
Shut the fuck up!

06:28.138 --> 06:29.973
Gee, we could get in
a lot a trouble.

06:30.140 --> 06:31.725
Y-you sure we should mess
with Jimmy and Timmy's

06:31.892 --> 06:33.060
science fair project?

06:33.227 --> 06:34.686
Mimsey, do you know
what Jimmy is?

06:34.853 --> 06:36.313
He's a cockblocker.

06:36.480 --> 06:37.940
Arr, what's a cockblocker?

06:38.107 --> 06:40.109
Every time I come up a way
to score with the ladies,

06:40.275 --> 06:42.069
there's Jimmy
trying to one-up me.

06:42.236 --> 06:44.279
This science fair is
supposed to finally make us

06:44.446 --> 06:46.365
successful enough
to get chicks.

06:46.532 --> 06:48.367
Aw, gee, I don't know
if we should use

06:48.534 --> 06:50.452
our position of power
to exploit women.

06:53.455 --> 06:55.874
I'm not letting those assholes
win the science fair.

06:56.041 --> 06:57.626
That's why I say...

06:57.793 --> 07:00.587
The only good water bears
are dead water bears.

07:09.721 --> 07:11.181
Let's go!

07:20.941 --> 07:22.693
This is bullcrap!

07:22.860 --> 07:25.404
How can they <i>force</i> me to be
the science fair judge?!

07:25.571 --> 07:27.698
Now I know how it feels
to be a slave!

07:27.865 --> 07:31.326
It's...not exactly like
being a slave, Heidi.

07:31.493 --> 07:34.413
Yes, it is! Am I being paid
to judge the science fair?

07:34.580 --> 07:35.497
No!

07:35.664 --> 07:37.249
Do I have a choice?
No.

07:37.416 --> 07:39.042
Ooh, yes, massa!

07:39.209 --> 07:41.378
Lemme judge that science fair
for ya, sir!

07:41.545 --> 07:43.422
God, will you <i>stop?</i>

07:43.589 --> 07:45.883
Theresa, don't get all aggro
on me because you're pissed off

07:46.049 --> 07:47.301
you're family
lives in a trailer.

07:47.468 --> 07:49.136
My family doesn't live
in a trailer.

07:49.303 --> 07:51.805
We live in a tiny home!
My parents downsized

07:51.972 --> 07:54.016
to make a smaller footprint
on the environment.

07:54.183 --> 07:56.518
That's what I said -- your
family lives in a trailer.

07:56.685 --> 07:59.813
There's lots of progressive
people living in tiny homes.

07:59.980 --> 08:02.149
There's five others
on our block!

08:02.316 --> 08:04.485
Right.
That's called a trailer <i>park.</i>

08:04.651 --> 08:06.236
I don't live in
a trailer park!

08:06.403 --> 08:07.905
Just don't even
respond to her.

08:08.071 --> 08:09.198
Just ignore her.

08:09.364 --> 08:11.283
I'll try, but she's
such a bitch.

08:11.450 --> 08:13.368
She wasn't talking
to you, Heidi.

08:13.535 --> 08:15.704
Oh! Looks like Isla has
something to say, you guys!

08:15.871 --> 08:17.706
Hold on, I'm sure this is
going to be really profound.

08:17.873 --> 08:20.042
Go ahead, Isla, knock us out
with your wit and satire.

08:20.209 --> 08:21.919
This should be good,
you guys!

08:22.085 --> 08:23.253
Hey, Heidi!
What's up?

08:23.420 --> 08:24.880
Oh, hey, babe,
what's going on?

08:25.047 --> 08:26.632
What are you up to?

08:26.798 --> 08:29.676
Nothing just talking to my
girlfriends about tiny homes.

08:33.847 --> 08:35.224
Well, hello there,
ladies.

08:35.390 --> 08:36.767
Oh, hi, Nathan.

08:36.934 --> 08:39.436
We just wanted to
remind you that this weekend

08:39.603 --> 08:41.230
is the Special Ed
Science Fair.

08:41.396 --> 08:43.023
Oh, cool.

08:43.190 --> 08:45.692
Yeah, that's right.

08:45.859 --> 08:48.320
Pretty sure you'll all be
impressed with what you see.

08:48.487 --> 08:50.489
Hope you can make it.

08:50.656 --> 08:52.407
Did you see that,
Mimsey?

08:52.574 --> 08:54.326
The way those girls
bit their bottom lips

08:54.493 --> 08:56.078
when I said Science Fair?

08:56.245 --> 08:58.497
We're about to be
drowning in muff.

08:58.664 --> 09:01.542
Nathan, Mimallah!
You gotta get to Special Ed!

09:01.708 --> 09:04.294
Special Ed class
isn't for another two hours.

09:04.461 --> 09:05.546
No, no!
You gotta see this!

09:05.712 --> 09:06.880
Jimmy and Timmy's
water bears!

09:07.047 --> 09:07.965
They've changed!

09:08.131 --> 09:09.299
What?

09:09.466 --> 09:10.467
- Whoa!
- Ooooh!

09:10.634 --> 09:11.760
- So cool!
- I can't believe it.

09:11.927 --> 09:13.679
Jimmy and Timmy,
this is incredible!

09:13.845 --> 09:16.265
You've somehow made them
even smarter!

09:16.431 --> 09:18.141
What's going on?

09:18.308 --> 09:19.518
Nathan!
It's amazing!

09:19.685 --> 09:20.769
The water bears we've
trained are starting

09:20.936 --> 09:22.688
to display
social advancements!

09:22.854 --> 09:24.523
But they're supposed
to be dead!

09:24.690 --> 09:25.816
Oof!

09:25.983 --> 09:27.484
What social advancements?

09:27.651 --> 09:28.986
They've actually evolved
to the point of doing

09:29.152 --> 09:30.362
the hokey pokey!

09:30.529 --> 09:33.115
The hokey pokey?

09:33.282 --> 09:35.867
♪ You put your right foot in,
you put your right foot out ♪

09:36.034 --> 09:38.579
♪ You put your right foot in,
and you shake it all about ♪

09:38.745 --> 09:40.914
♪ You do the hokey pokey
and you turn yourself around ♪

09:41.081 --> 09:42.416
♪ That's what it's all about ♪

09:42.583 --> 09:44.626
You gotta be fucking
kidding me.

09:44.793 --> 09:46.920
Boys, this might be
the single greatest

09:47.087 --> 09:50.549
Special Ed Science Fair
project I've ever seen!

09:56.555 --> 09:57.806
Butters.

09:57.973 --> 09:59.641
Oh! Hey!

09:59.808 --> 10:01.143
How would you like to
be the judge

10:01.310 --> 10:02.811
for the Special Ed Science Fair
this weekend?

10:02.978 --> 10:04.605
Uh, I can't.

10:04.771 --> 10:06.356
I'm going to a birthday party.

10:06.523 --> 10:07.691
Butters, don't be a dick!

10:07.858 --> 10:09.359
Yeah don't
make up excuses

10:09.526 --> 10:11.445
because judging handicapped
students sounds terrible.

10:11.612 --> 10:13.071
Yeah, Butters. God!

10:13.238 --> 10:15.032
He's not making it up.
It's <i>my</i> birthday party.

10:15.198 --> 10:16.658
Well, then could you
invite Heidi, please?

10:16.825 --> 10:17.868
She needs an excuse
not to have to go to

10:18.035 --> 10:19.411
the special needs
science fair.

10:19.578 --> 10:21.038
What's wrong with supporting
them, they're our friends?

10:21.204 --> 10:22.748
Because nobody wants
to be trapped in a gym

10:22.914 --> 10:24.416
with Special Ed science.

10:24.583 --> 10:26.501
Actually, some of their projects
are pretty cool.

10:26.668 --> 10:28.086
- Shut up, Kyle!
- Shut up, Kyle!

10:28.253 --> 10:30.464
- Samesies!
- Samesies!

10:30.631 --> 10:33.008
Look, it's all just
a complete waste of time!

10:33.175 --> 10:35.010
It's not like
a Special Ed Science Fair

10:35.177 --> 10:36.803
is actually gonna
contribute to society!

10:48.649 --> 10:51.568
Move! Move aside, kids!
Official business!

10:51.735 --> 10:53.862
Move it, children!

10:54.029 --> 10:56.114
Excuse me,
can I help you?

10:56.281 --> 10:58.825
We understand that you're
about to have a science fair

10:58.992 --> 11:01.912
with some <i>very</i> interesting
experiments.

11:02.079 --> 11:03.455
That's right. The science fair

11:03.622 --> 11:05.082
is this Saturday
from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.

11:05.248 --> 11:07.125
We're here to help
however we can.

11:07.292 --> 11:08.752
Your Special Ed department

11:08.919 --> 11:11.129
has all our resources
and our support.

11:11.296 --> 11:12.923
This science fair...

11:13.090 --> 11:16.468
just might be
what saves us all.

11:20.305 --> 11:21.723
What the hell
is going on?!

11:21.890 --> 11:24.017
Everywhere I turn, people
are being given handouts

11:24.184 --> 11:26.478
while I'm forced
to work my ass off!

11:26.645 --> 11:28.438
It's total bullshit!

11:28.605 --> 11:31.900
Yeah. Uh, babe I understand
that you're pissed off,

11:32.067 --> 11:33.735
but, um, you know,
it <i>is</i> recess.

11:33.902 --> 11:35.278
Maybe we should relax
and have some fun.

11:35.445 --> 11:37.698
Relax?
How can I relax?!

11:37.864 --> 11:39.950
I get straight A's!
I ace every test!

11:40.117 --> 11:41.910
And who gets
all the support?

11:42.077 --> 11:43.954
The Special Ed
department!

11:47.791 --> 11:49.084
Good.
Bring it on in.

11:49.251 --> 11:50.836
These kids need
to have access

11:51.002 --> 11:52.504
to everything
they need.

11:52.671 --> 11:54.089
Wow, look at this,
Tim Tim.

11:54.256 --> 11:55.841
They've all been researching
water bears, too!

11:56.007 --> 11:57.259
That's correct.

11:57.426 --> 11:59.261
Like you,
we've come to realize

11:59.428 --> 12:01.972
that water bears are
the key to our future.

12:02.139 --> 12:03.890
Are these
the special water bears

12:04.057 --> 12:05.726
we read about
on your school message board?

12:05.892 --> 12:07.269
That's right.

12:07.436 --> 12:08.729
The water bears
we've been working with

12:08.895 --> 12:10.731
appear to be evolving
somehow.

12:10.897 --> 12:13.900
Then they are the key
to our survival, boys.

12:14.067 --> 12:17.279
Gentlemen, perhaps
I can interest you in a lava volcano.

12:17.446 --> 12:18.613
You won't believe
your eyes

12:18.780 --> 12:20.365
when I add
some simple baking soda.

12:20.532 --> 12:22.159
There's no time for that.

12:22.325 --> 12:24.995
We need everyone working
on Jimmy and Timmy's project.

12:25.162 --> 12:27.914
I'm gonna let you kids all in
on a little secret.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.166
We don't want
to create a panic,

12:29.332 --> 12:31.877
but the end
is very near...

12:32.043 --> 12:34.463
and we have
very little time.

12:36.173 --> 12:37.424
Fellow students,

12:37.591 --> 12:39.009
I have asked
to speak today

12:39.176 --> 12:40.844
because of the hypocrisy
and bullying

12:41.011 --> 12:42.471
that is coming
from the administration

12:42.637 --> 12:45.140
at this so-called skewl.

12:45.307 --> 12:47.559
It is an outrage that
our principal and counselors

12:47.726 --> 12:49.978
demand our participation
in frivolous programs

12:50.145 --> 12:52.063
that are outrageously
overfunded.

12:52.230 --> 12:54.024
Why is it that
the school allows funding

12:54.191 --> 12:56.026
that only goes
to special-needs students?

12:56.193 --> 12:57.944
Are the rest of us
not special?

12:58.111 --> 13:00.822
If we are continually asked
to work for no money

13:00.989 --> 13:03.366
and ask our parents
to pay for our programs,

13:03.533 --> 13:05.368
then soon
we will all be poor

13:05.535 --> 13:07.329
and forced to live
in a trailer park, like Theresa.

13:07.496 --> 13:08.789
It's not a <i>trailer!</i>

13:08.955 --> 13:10.540
Theresa, get over it.

13:10.707 --> 13:11.917
You live in a trailer park.
It's not a big deal.

13:12.083 --> 13:13.460
Oh, o-okay, honey.

13:13.627 --> 13:14.503
You're kind of getting
off topic, sweetie.

13:14.669 --> 13:16.296
What did you say?!

13:16.463 --> 13:18.089
I just -- I just want you
to stay on point

13:18.256 --> 13:19.174
so we can
get this over with.

13:19.341 --> 13:20.675
"Get this over with"?!

13:20.842 --> 13:22.552
You're supposed
to be supporting me!

13:22.719 --> 13:24.471
I <i>am</i> supporting you,
sweetheart.

13:24.638 --> 13:27.057
Being supportive doesn't mean
you criticize me, asshole!

13:27.224 --> 13:28.600
Just forget it!

13:28.767 --> 13:30.811
My point is,
if the school administration

13:30.977 --> 13:32.479
doesn't cancel
the science fair,

13:32.646 --> 13:34.189
I will see to it
that they are all fired

13:34.356 --> 13:36.608
for discrimination!

13:36.775 --> 13:38.652
She's kind of
like Cartman

13:38.819 --> 13:41.363
but with the ability
to follow through.

13:41.530 --> 13:43.990
Oh, dude.
Bro.

13:44.157 --> 13:47.744
Francis, could you hand me
the sound-wave generator?

13:47.911 --> 13:49.579
This is bullshit.

13:49.746 --> 13:51.832
The Special Ed Science Fair
is turning into a love-fest

13:51.998 --> 13:53.291
for Jimmy
and Timmy's project.

13:53.458 --> 13:55.460
They're gonna get
all the fame and glory.

13:55.627 --> 13:57.796
Yeah, I guess we kind
of shot ourselves in the foot, huh, boss?

13:57.963 --> 13:59.422
If it weren't for us,
those water bears

13:59.589 --> 14:02.050
wouldn't have even gotten
smarter in the first place.

14:02.217 --> 14:04.261
Hey, Mimsey.
That's right.

14:04.427 --> 14:05.595
They don't deserve
the credit.

14:05.762 --> 14:06.596
<i>We</i> do.

14:06.763 --> 14:08.598
Uh, excuse me.

14:08.765 --> 14:10.016
If you're all trying
to figure out

14:10.183 --> 14:11.810
why these water bears
are different,

14:11.977 --> 14:13.436
you're talking
to the wrong guy.

14:13.603 --> 14:15.021
Wh-What do you mean,
Nathan?

14:15.188 --> 14:16.314
Mimsey and I did
some experimenting

14:16.481 --> 14:17.899
with the water bears
on our own --

14:18.066 --> 14:19.442
We was tryin'
to kill 'em!

14:19.609 --> 14:21.820
It was us who made them evolve.

14:21.987 --> 14:23.989
So we should be the ones
working for the government.

14:24.155 --> 14:25.282
The government?

14:25.448 --> 14:26.741
W-We aren't
the government.

14:26.908 --> 14:28.326
Y-You're not
the government?

14:28.493 --> 14:29.661
But you said you were here
to help stop us

14:29.828 --> 14:30.662
from becoming extinct.

14:30.829 --> 14:33.748
Not you, <i>us.</i>

14:33.915 --> 14:36.918
We're with...the NFL.

14:39.212 --> 14:42.632
Our fans are leaving
at an exponential rate.

14:42.799 --> 14:44.968
We've been hit
with anthem protests,

14:45.135 --> 14:46.928
protests
to those protests,

14:47.095 --> 14:48.763
and, worse of all,
concussions.

14:48.930 --> 14:50.640
The more reports
that come out,

14:50.807 --> 14:53.226
the more people are getting
turned off by football.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.437
We've been experimenting
with water bears

14:55.604 --> 14:58.481
because we believe
they are our last hope.

14:58.648 --> 15:00.358
Oh, I get it!

15:00.525 --> 15:01.776
You've been experimenting
with water bears to see how

15:01.943 --> 15:04.362
to make humans more impervious
to concussions.

15:04.529 --> 15:06.948
No. We've been experimenting
with water bears

15:07.115 --> 15:09.618
to try
and make them <i>fans.</i>

15:12.621 --> 15:13.788
A beautiful
night for football

15:13.955 --> 15:15.290
here in Los Angeles

15:15.457 --> 15:17.334
as the Chargers take on
the Buffalo Bills.

15:17.500 --> 15:18.835
And a record sellout crowd

15:19.002 --> 15:20.337
here at the stadium.

15:20.503 --> 15:22.339
Football clearly
more popular than ever,

15:22.505 --> 15:26.009
with a whopping 17 million
in attendance!

15:26.176 --> 15:29.095
The NFL, of course,
working really hard to reach new viewers,

15:29.262 --> 15:30.555
and it looks like
they've found their answer

15:30.722 --> 15:32.307
in tardigrades.

15:32.474 --> 15:34.225
The water bears are thrilled
to be here,

15:34.392 --> 15:37.187
and, of course, love seeing
themselves on the jumbotron.

15:37.354 --> 15:39.356
They're all ready
for some football,

15:39.522 --> 15:41.858
and enjoying
the fan-favorite kiss cam!

15:42.025 --> 15:43.818
And we're ready for kickoff

15:43.985 --> 15:47.739
as the cheers of 17 million fans
rock the stadium!

16:02.754 --> 16:05.340
We're running
out of time.

16:05.507 --> 16:06.716
We have to see
if these water bears

16:06.883 --> 16:08.009
truly are different.

16:08.176 --> 16:10.095
Insert the box!

16:14.099 --> 16:15.684
Gently.

16:17.352 --> 16:18.728
What do you see now?

16:18.895 --> 16:20.146
Uh...

16:20.313 --> 16:21.606
I see the box.

16:21.773 --> 16:23.274
What-- What's
in the box?

16:23.441 --> 16:24.985
What are
the water bears doing?

16:25.151 --> 16:28.488
Uh, they're just walking around,
and -- Oh, wait!

16:28.655 --> 16:30.740
They appear to be interested
in the box!

16:30.907 --> 16:32.993
These water bears
<i>are</i> different.

16:33.159 --> 16:34.703
All right, everyone,
listen up!

16:34.869 --> 16:36.204
Give me your attention,
please.

16:36.371 --> 16:39.916
Due to circumstances
beyond our control,

16:40.083 --> 16:42.752
we are canceling
the Special Ed Science Fair.

16:44.212 --> 16:45.839
- Oh, no! Canceling?
- What?

16:46.006 --> 16:47.799
You can't cancel
the science fair.

16:47.966 --> 16:49.843
We're on the verge
of a breakthrough here.

16:50.010 --> 16:51.594
It's canceled.
You guys can all get this shit

16:51.761 --> 16:53.263
out of here and leave.
Thank you.

16:53.430 --> 16:54.973
You don't understand!

16:55.140 --> 16:56.850
The Special Ed Science Fair
is our only hope!

16:57.017 --> 16:59.436
I'm sorry, but, uh,
our hands are tied...

16:59.602 --> 17:00.687
by Heidi.

17:04.232 --> 17:05.859
I think you all
fail to understand

17:06.026 --> 17:07.485
the seriousness
of our situation --

17:07.652 --> 17:09.195
Football is dying!

17:09.362 --> 17:10.697
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Okay.

17:10.864 --> 17:13.491
Close the door!
Everyone back to work.

17:13.658 --> 17:16.703
Nobody will stop
this Special Ed Science Fair!

17:16.870 --> 17:18.204
Do what he says!

17:18.371 --> 17:20.498
Aah! Okay!
Jesus Christ!

17:20.665 --> 17:22.834
Are you just gonna stand there?
Do something!

17:23.001 --> 17:24.461
What the hell
do you want <i>me</i> to do?

17:24.627 --> 17:25.628
I want you
to have some balls

17:25.795 --> 17:27.255
and act like
you care about me!

17:27.422 --> 17:30.050
Heidi, you need to stop
being such a bitch!

17:30.216 --> 17:32.552
Call me
a "bitch" again.

17:34.095 --> 17:35.638
Do it.

17:35.805 --> 17:37.348
Call me
a "bitch" again.

17:39.809 --> 17:44.105
You are...acting...
like a...bad girlfriend.

17:44.272 --> 17:45.857
That's what I thought!

17:46.024 --> 17:47.776
Hey, wait a minute!

17:47.942 --> 17:49.527
The water bears
have changed again.

17:49.694 --> 17:50.820
I think it's working.

17:50.987 --> 17:52.822
Let me see that!

17:52.989 --> 17:55.241
Yes!
Yes, they're starting to adapt!

17:59.871 --> 18:02.332
Son of a bitch. We just might
have ourselves some fans.

18:02.499 --> 18:04.167
Now, quickly, children.

18:04.334 --> 18:06.711
We must replicate these
water bears to create more!

18:06.878 --> 18:09.422
If nobody else is gonna
do anything, I will!

18:10.215 --> 18:11.299
Wha--

18:11.466 --> 18:12.467
The water bears!

18:16.262 --> 18:17.138
- Get her!
- Stop her!

18:17.305 --> 18:18.515
She's over here!

18:21.768 --> 18:22.685
Heidi!

18:22.852 --> 18:24.062
Heidi, will you please
listen to me?!

18:24.229 --> 18:25.688
Move it!

18:25.855 --> 18:27.148
Get the fuck
outta the way!

18:27.315 --> 18:29.526
I said get outta the way,
you assholes!

18:29.692 --> 18:30.485
- Get her!
- She's over here!

18:36.116 --> 18:37.200
We got the fat girl.

18:37.367 --> 18:38.034
Front of the school.

18:38.201 --> 18:39.911
Shit!

18:41.621 --> 18:43.164
Little girl, stop.

18:45.792 --> 18:47.752
It doesn't have to end
this way.

18:47.919 --> 18:49.546
Move aside!
Move aside!

18:49.712 --> 18:51.631
Heidi, seriously...

18:51.798 --> 18:52.966
you need
to listen to me.

18:53.133 --> 18:55.385
I don't...have to listen...

18:55.552 --> 18:56.553
to anybody.

18:56.719 --> 18:59.222
Yes. Yes, you do.

18:59.389 --> 19:00.932
You need to listen.

19:01.099 --> 19:01.975
Fuck you.

19:02.142 --> 19:04.185
No fuck you.

19:04.352 --> 19:06.187
Little girl, please.

19:06.354 --> 19:08.731
What you have in your hand
is very special.

19:08.898 --> 19:11.317
Well, I'm sick of everyone
treating me like shit.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.111
Think about the NFL --

19:13.278 --> 19:16.156
how much joy
it brings everyone.

19:16.322 --> 19:19.534
Don't listen to them.
Give the water bears to me.

19:19.701 --> 19:21.536
I deserve all the fame
and bitches.

19:21.703 --> 19:24.747
Heidi, you gotta stop
being so angry.

19:24.914 --> 19:26.916
Look, if you -- if you don't
do it for the NFL,

19:27.083 --> 19:28.877
what about humanity?

19:29.043 --> 19:31.838
Those creatures are showing
the first signs of sentience.

19:32.005 --> 19:34.841
Think about what they could
mean for science,

19:35.008 --> 19:37.802
for medicine,
making people better.

19:37.969 --> 19:39.345
Come on, babe.

19:39.512 --> 19:41.723
We all want
the old Heidi back.

19:48.563 --> 19:50.940
Screw all you guys.

19:56.779 --> 19:58.656
Ahh!

20:01.576 --> 20:03.578
Dude. Wow.

20:13.254 --> 20:16.090
Is there something
you wanna talk about?

20:16.257 --> 20:19.469
No, I was just
trying to figure out

20:19.636 --> 20:22.805
why you decided to drink
20,000 micro animals

20:22.972 --> 20:24.098
that were showing
signs of intelligence.

20:24.265 --> 20:27.227
Whatever. It's Saturday,
and I'm not in school.

20:27.393 --> 20:29.646
Yeah, you're -- you're
not in school.

20:31.773 --> 20:33.149
How come we never
snuggle anymore?

20:33.316 --> 20:34.692
Wh-What?

20:34.859 --> 20:35.777
We used to snuggle
all the time,

20:35.944 --> 20:36.903
and it's totally
gone away.

20:37.070 --> 20:38.029
What's happened?

20:38.196 --> 20:39.989
- Well, bunny, we still --
- Snuggle!

20:40.156 --> 20:43.284
Yes, yes, let's -- let's
snuggle, yes.

20:44.661 --> 20:46.204
God damn it!
How come there's nothing

20:46.371 --> 20:48.373
to watch on Saturday
but kids' cartoons?

20:48.539 --> 20:51.751
<i>All right, kids!
Now let's do the hokey pokey!</i>

20:51.918 --> 20:54.337
<i>♪ You put your left foot in,
you put your left foot out ♪</i>

20:54.504 --> 20:55.964
<i>♪ You put your left foot in ♪</i>

20:56.130 --> 20:56.881
<i>♪ And you shake it all about ♪</i>
Ooh.

20:57.048 --> 20:58.091
What's going on
in nya?

20:58.258 --> 20:59.926
Whoa.
What <i>is</i> going on in nya?

21:00.093 --> 21:01.302
I feel something
moving around.

21:01.469 --> 21:02.428
Ahp --

21:02.595 --> 21:04.138
Ew.

21:04.305 --> 21:05.223
Snuggle!

21:05.390 --> 21:06.516
Okay.
Okay, honey.

21:06.683 --> 21:09.269
Agh. Ugh.

21:15.275 --> 21:16.693
Well?

21:16.859 --> 21:19.362
Did you have any luck,
Mr. Jones?

21:19.529 --> 21:23.449
I'm afraid, Commissioner,
that the Special Ed Science Fair

21:23.616 --> 21:26.452
failed to produce
more viable water bears.

21:26.619 --> 21:29.706
Then the NFL
truly has no hope.

21:29.872 --> 21:31.666
We're done for.

21:31.833 --> 21:33.960
Not quite.

21:34.127 --> 21:36.754
We were able to obtain
something else

21:36.921 --> 21:39.632
that just might be
our future.

21:42.802 --> 21:45.346
Ohh!
