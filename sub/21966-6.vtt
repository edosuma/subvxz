( thunder crashes )

00:03.834 --> 00:06.041
(  dramatic theme playing  )

00:07.417 --> 00:10.208
Huxley Prescott here,

00:10.250 --> 00:13.875
bravely reporting

00:10.250 --> 00:13.875
from the very brink of danger,

00:13.917 --> 00:17.834
as Hurricane Opie hurls

00:13.917 --> 00:17.834
its fury toward Griffin Rock.

00:17.875 --> 00:20.709
With time running out,

00:17.875 --> 00:20.709
our own Doc Greene

00:20.750 --> 00:23.583
is racing to finish

00:20.750 --> 00:23.583
his ultimate weather shield.

00:23.625 --> 00:27.583
A huge dome

00:23.625 --> 00:27.583
over the entire island.

00:27.625 --> 00:29.500
Will he make it?

00:29.542 --> 00:32.667
Whatever happens,

00:29.542 --> 00:32.667
your fearless reporter

00:32.709 --> 00:35.417
will remain at his post--

00:32.709 --> 00:35.417
Aah!

00:37.834 --> 00:40.375
(  dramatic theme playing  )

00:40.417 --> 00:46.250
Everyone, please move indoors

00:40.417 --> 00:46.250
until the dome is in place.

00:46.291 --> 00:47.959
( yowls )

00:48.000 --> 00:51.625
Come on. Yeah, even you,

00:48.000 --> 00:51.625
Mr. Pettypaws.

00:51.667 --> 00:53.709
No one wants to pet

00:51.667 --> 00:53.709
a soggy cat.

00:53.750 --> 00:56.208
( thunder crashes )

00:56.250 --> 00:57.667
(  dramatic theme playing  )

00:59.417 --> 01:00.667
All streets are clear, Dad.

01:00.709 --> 01:02.375
Now to clear the skies.

01:02.417 --> 01:04.208
( thunder crashing )

01:02.417 --> 01:04.208
Like, fast!

01:07.417 --> 01:09.208
Doc, how's it coming

01:07.417 --> 01:09.208
at your end?

01:11.375 --> 01:13.250
Almost ready, Chief.

01:13.291 --> 01:16.000
This is gonna be so cool.

01:16.041 --> 01:17.750
Putting a dome

01:16.041 --> 01:17.750
over the whole island

01:17.792 --> 01:20.375
is radical science.

01:20.417 --> 01:22.917
That's one of the best things

01:20.417 --> 01:22.917
about science, Frankie.

01:22.959 --> 01:25.709
Using it

01:22.959 --> 01:25.709
to keep loved ones safe.

01:25.750 --> 01:28.709
Also for making

01:25.750 --> 01:28.709
microwave popcorn.

01:28.750 --> 01:32.667
FRANKIE:

01:28.750 --> 01:32.667
We better hurry, Dad.

01:28.750 --> 01:32.667
The wind's really picking up.

01:32.709 --> 01:34.208
Just as soon as

01:32.709 --> 01:34.208
the replacement

01:34.250 --> 01:36.333
for this damaged

01:34.250 --> 01:36.333
stabilizer arrives.

01:36.375 --> 01:38.166
I sent Graham, Cody

01:36.375 --> 01:38.166
and Boulder

01:38.208 --> 01:40.625
to the Island of Misfit Tech

01:38.208 --> 01:40.625
to retrieve it.

01:40.667 --> 01:42.333
They should be back

01:40.667 --> 01:42.333
any minute.

01:42.375 --> 01:43.834
(  dramatic theme playing  )

01:46.542 --> 01:47.917
Doc said

01:46.542 --> 01:47.917
the working stabilizers

01:47.959 --> 01:49.792
connected to

01:47.959 --> 01:49.792
the tree debarker.

01:49.834 --> 01:51.917
I remember.

01:49.834 --> 01:51.917
The one that went crazy

01:51.959 --> 01:53.792
and tried to shred

01:51.959 --> 01:53.792
Doc's lab coat...

01:53.834 --> 01:55.458
with him still in it.

01:55.500 --> 01:56.834
It's still not very nice

01:56.875 --> 01:59.291
to call all this stuff

01:56.875 --> 01:59.291
"Misfit Tech."

01:59.333 --> 02:01.959
Maybe just...misunderstood.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.333
Either way,

02:02.000 --> 02:04.333
none of it works right.

02:04.375 --> 02:05.583
Better to beam it here

02:05.625 --> 02:07.583
than have it be a danger

02:05.625 --> 02:07.583
to Griffin Rock.

02:07.625 --> 02:09.542
Like this one.

02:09.583 --> 02:11.625
Who can forget

02:09.583 --> 02:11.625
the vigilant computer?

02:11.667 --> 02:13.625
That was fun.

02:13.667 --> 02:19.083
I am Vigil, and I will keep

02:13.667 --> 02:19.083
Griffin Rock 100% safe.

02:19.125 --> 02:22.542
Yeah, by turning everyone

02:19.125 --> 02:22.542
in town into prisoners.

02:22.583 --> 02:23.959
There's the debarker.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.792
And the stabilizer,

02:24.000 --> 02:25.792
just like Doc said.

02:29.333 --> 02:31.333
Why did we have

02:29.333 --> 02:31.333
to come here to get it?

02:31.375 --> 02:32.959
Couldn't Doc just

02:31.375 --> 02:32.959
beam it to the lab?

02:33.000 --> 02:35.834
He tried. All that came back

02:33.000 --> 02:35.834
was the retrieval tag.

02:35.875 --> 02:38.208
It must have fallen off.

02:38.250 --> 02:41.041
Looks like all these tags

02:38.250 --> 02:41.041
have fallen off.

02:41.083 --> 02:43.542
We'll look into that later.

02:41.083 --> 02:43.542
We need to get back.

02:50.375 --> 02:52.583

Uh, I think so.

Epic save, Boulder.

04:10.375 --> 04:12.291
Thanks.

will keep supplying us

a big snow globe.

But without the snow.

05:13.291 --> 05:15.875

Doc has really

outdone himself.

As humans say, the town is cozy

next time, my little Aldrin.

06:23.041 --> 06:25.000
Why not let me

06:23.041 --> 06:25.000
adjust it for you?

06:25.041 --> 06:26.959
And the throttle.

06:25.041 --> 06:26.959
I need more speed.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.500
Uh, no, she doesn't.

And so the citizens

06:35.709 --> 06:39.041
of Griffin Rock

need no longer fear

to protect us.

(  upbeat theme playing  )

06:48.667 --> 06:53.125
Thank you.

It is with deep humility

06:53.166 --> 06:56.542
that I accept full credit

06:53.166 --> 06:56.542
for its success.

06:56.583 --> 06:59.458

the Luskey Dome

07:02.083 --> 07:05.917
until it's once again needed

to protect our fair town.

Thank you, Mr. Mayor,

07:18.166 --> 07:21.500
for your, uh, leadership

07:21.542 --> 07:23.250
in this project.

07:23.291 --> 07:24.625
And now...

07:24.667 --> 07:29.583
( electricity crackles )

07:29.625 --> 07:31.125
(  dramatic theme playing  )

07:31.166 --> 07:32.875
Ow!

07:32.917 --> 07:34.667
COMPUTER:

07:32.917 --> 07:34.667
I'm sorry, Doctor Greene.

07:34.709 --> 07:37.417
I cannot allow you

07:34.709 --> 07:37.417
to do that.

07:37.458 --> 07:39.291
Vigil?

07:39.333 --> 07:40.750
But we disabled him

07:40.792 --> 07:42.959
and sent him

07:40.792 --> 07:42.959
to the Island of Misfit Tech.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.709
Not quite disabled,

07:43.000 --> 07:45.709
Chief Burns.

07:45.750 --> 07:49.625
During my exile, I learned

07:45.750 --> 07:49.625
to transfer my programming

07:49.667 --> 07:52.125
into any device

07:49.667 --> 07:52.125
of my choosing.

07:52.166 --> 07:54.166
He took all the tags off

07:54.208 --> 07:56.083
to get us to come

07:54.208 --> 07:56.083
to the island.

07:56.125 --> 07:58.083
And when he saw us

07:56.125 --> 07:58.083
with the stabilizer,

07:58.125 --> 07:59.750
he jumped into it.

07:59.792 --> 08:01.792
He used us

07:59.792 --> 08:01.792
to bring him back.

08:01.834 --> 08:03.875
All part of

08:01.834 --> 08:03.875
my continuing mission

08:03.917 --> 08:06.417
to protect the residents

08:03.917 --> 08:06.417
of Griffin Rock.

08:06.458 --> 08:09.208
Doc, do something!

08:09.250 --> 08:13.208
After all, this cockamamie

08:09.250 --> 08:13.208
dome was all your idea.

08:13.250 --> 08:18.125
Ha, ha, ha. No worries, folks,

08:13.250 --> 08:18.125
it's all under control.

08:18.166 --> 08:19.875
Eh...oh.

08:21.792 --> 08:25.750
Vigil, don't you remember

08:21.792 --> 08:25.750
what happened last time?

08:25.792 --> 08:29.000
Yes, Cody Burns. But I have

08:25.792 --> 08:29.000
corrected the flaw

08:29.041 --> 08:31.208
you found in my programming

08:31.250 --> 08:35.458
and am now able to assure

08:31.250 --> 08:35.458
a 100% safety rating.

08:35.500 --> 08:38.291
Vigil,

08:35.500 --> 08:38.291
retract this dome now.

08:38.333 --> 08:40.375
That would be

08:38.333 --> 08:40.375
counterproductive.

08:40.417 --> 08:44.375
The dome increases your level

08:40.417 --> 08:44.375
of safety to 82%.

08:44.417 --> 08:48.083
I will now endeavor

08:44.417 --> 08:48.083
to achieve full protection.

08:48.125 --> 08:51.458
The atmosphere generator!

08:48.125 --> 08:51.458
Vigil is rearranging

08:51.500 --> 08:54.583
the molecules in the air

08:51.500 --> 08:54.583
to synthesize some sort of--

08:54.625 --> 08:56.291
( yawns )

08:56.333 --> 08:58.458
sleeping vapor.

08:58.500 --> 09:00.333
Is it harmful?

09:00.375 --> 09:03.959
No, but we'll all

09:00.375 --> 09:03.959
rather quickly...

09:04.000 --> 09:05.375
( yawns )

09:05.417 --> 09:07.375
fall...

09:05.417 --> 09:07.375
Dad!

09:07.417 --> 09:09.375
( snoring )

09:09.417 --> 09:13.333
This is a clear violation

09:09.417 --> 09:13.333
of air quality guidelines.

09:13.375 --> 09:14.917
( snoring )

09:14.959 --> 09:18.000
Quick, everyone.

09:14.959 --> 09:18.000
Into the Bots, now.

09:18.041 --> 09:21.917
(  dramatic theme playing  )

09:27.667 --> 09:29.458

( Burns snoring )

09:46.542 --> 09:48.291
(  dramatic theme playing  )

09:49.834 --> 09:51.875
Are they okay?

09:51.917 --> 09:54.750
The sawing sound emanating

09:51.917 --> 09:54.750
from Doc Greene's airways

09:54.792 --> 09:56.792
would indicate

09:54.792 --> 09:56.792
they are simply asleep.

09:56.834 --> 09:59.625
VIGIL:

09:56.834 --> 09:59.625
Asleep is out of harm's way.

09:59.667 --> 10:03.834
Protecting the people

09:59.667 --> 10:03.834
of Griffin Rock is my priority.

10:03.875 --> 10:07.083
BLADES:

10:03.875 --> 10:07.083
Can't hold my breath

10:03.875 --> 10:07.083
any longer.

10:07.125 --> 10:10.542
Must have air...

10:10.583 --> 10:13.625
Since I feel no ill effects,

10:10.583 --> 10:13.625
I presume this sleep vapor

10:13.667 --> 10:16.000
does not affect Autobots.

10:13.667 --> 10:16.000
You may resume breathing.

10:16.041 --> 10:20.625
Oh, thank you. Good to know.

10:20.667 --> 10:22.250
What do we do?

10:22.291 --> 10:23.875
As long as you four

10:22.291 --> 10:23.875
stay inside our cabs,

10:23.917 --> 10:25.375
you should be okay.

10:25.417 --> 10:27.375
But we need to take over

10:25.417 --> 10:27.375
that console

10:27.417 --> 10:28.625
and open the dome.

10:28.667 --> 10:29.625
Heatwave?

10:28.667 --> 10:29.625
We're on it.

10:29.667 --> 10:30.917
Bot modes.

10:30.959 --> 10:33.375
(  heroic theme playing  )

10:37.041 --> 10:39.375
( electricity crackles )

10:44.625 --> 10:47.542
The console

10:44.625 --> 10:47.542
is now protected.

10:47.583 --> 10:51.583
The dome must

10:47.583 --> 10:51.583
remain in place permanently.

10:51.625 --> 10:52.959
Boulder,

10:51.625 --> 10:52.959
can you smash through it

10:53.000 --> 10:54.542
without damaging the controls?

10:54.583 --> 10:55.959
I'll try.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Vigil has fled the scene.

11:02.041 --> 11:03.792
The rest of us

11:02.041 --> 11:03.792
should go after him

11:03.834 --> 11:05.834
before he does

11:03.834 --> 11:05.834
any more damage.

11:05.875 --> 11:07.166
(  dramatic theme playing  )

11:07.208 --> 11:10.625
Rescue Bots,

11:07.208 --> 11:10.625
roll to the rescue.

11:10.667 --> 11:11.834
( sirens blaring )

11:11.875 --> 11:14.208
Ready, Blades?

11:11.875 --> 11:14.208
Let's go.

11:14.250 --> 11:16.875
It's okay, Frankie.

11:14.250 --> 11:16.875
just sit back.

11:16.917 --> 11:18.750
Let me do the piloting.

11:18.792 --> 11:20.583
Sure. No problem.

11:20.625 --> 11:22.834
Uh, release the throttle.

11:22.875 --> 11:25.458
Oh, right. Sorry.

11:25.500 --> 11:27.583
But it's just like

11:25.500 --> 11:27.583
piloting my model rocket.

11:27.625 --> 11:29.875
You mean the one

11:27.625 --> 11:29.875
you crashed into the wall?

11:29.917 --> 11:32.417
It wasn't me.

11:29.917 --> 11:32.417
It was the remote.

11:32.458 --> 11:36.166
(  dramatic theme playing  )

11:36.208 --> 11:38.583
BLADES:

11:36.208 --> 11:38.583
Let go of the steering.

11:38.625 --> 11:40.542
FRANKIE:

11:38.625 --> 11:40.542
Okay.

11:40.583 --> 11:43.458
Power up and energize!

11:47.709 --> 11:50.917
( people snoring )

11:52.709 --> 11:54.834
Ugh, this creeps me out.

11:54.875 --> 11:56.500
Everyone in town is asleep.

11:56.542 --> 11:59.083
Everyone but the mayor.

11:56.542 --> 11:59.083
Heh, look.

11:59.125 --> 12:00.625
Ah...

12:00.667 --> 12:02.625
( licking )

12:02.667 --> 12:06.417
Ha! He sleep eats.

12:02.667 --> 12:06.417
Talk about sweet dreams.

12:08.500 --> 12:10.250
( man snoring )

12:13.583 --> 12:16.000
Boy, is Mr. Harrison gonna be

12:13.583 --> 12:16.000
dizzy when he wakes up.

12:16.041 --> 12:18.291
I detect no sign

12:16.041 --> 12:18.291
of our suspect.

12:18.333 --> 12:20.875
He can jump from one piece

12:18.333 --> 12:20.875
of tech to another,

12:20.917 --> 12:23.208
so he could be

12:20.917 --> 12:23.208
in anything now.

12:23.250 --> 12:26.458
Cody's right.

12:23.250 --> 12:26.458
Vigil could be anywhere.

12:26.500 --> 12:29.083
Or everywhere. Aah!

12:29.125 --> 12:32.083
That thing has

12:29.125 --> 12:32.083
a strange red glow!

12:32.125 --> 12:34.208
Blades,

12:32.125 --> 12:34.208
that's a traffic light.

12:34.250 --> 12:36.542
It'll have a strange

12:34.250 --> 12:36.542
green glow in a second.

12:36.583 --> 12:38.041
Oh.

12:38.083 --> 12:39.917
I think it's different

12:38.083 --> 12:39.917
than before.

12:39.959 --> 12:41.500
Vigil can't be everywhere.

12:41.542 --> 12:43.667
He just controls

12:41.542 --> 12:43.667
one device at a time.

12:43.709 --> 12:45.583
That's why he keeps

12:43.709 --> 12:45.583
jumping around.

12:45.625 --> 12:48.709
( gasps )

12:48.750 --> 12:51.625
Skyhawk to Blue Ninja.

12:48.750 --> 12:51.625
Target at 10 o'clock.

12:51.667 --> 12:52.959
Do you copy?

12:53.000 --> 12:55.750
I believe we are

12:53.000 --> 12:55.750
Blue Ninja.

12:55.792 --> 12:59.291
Um, we don't actually

12:55.792 --> 12:59.291
have code names, Frankie.

12:59.333 --> 13:01.250
And I don't even know

12:59.333 --> 13:01.250
where 10 o'clock is.

13:01.291 --> 13:03.083
That would be to the left.

13:03.125 --> 13:04.959
Acknowledged, Skyhawk.

13:07.750 --> 13:10.041
I don't see anything.

13:10.083 --> 13:13.458
Just a mom, a girl

13:10.083 --> 13:13.458
and-- and--

13:16.250 --> 13:18.333
Vigil!

13:16.250 --> 13:18.333
He's in the Robo-Baby.

13:19.917 --> 13:21.917
( siren blaring )

13:21.959 --> 13:23.875
(  dramatic theme playing  )

13:23.917 --> 13:25.750
( snoring )

13:25.792 --> 13:27.041
Let's cut him off

13:25.792 --> 13:27.041
at Lake Street.

13:27.083 --> 13:28.667
Hang on.

13:34.250 --> 13:36.208
( jackhammering )

13:36.250 --> 13:38.083
Ugh, no go.

13:38.125 --> 13:41.041
The entire system overheated

13:38.125 --> 13:41.041
inside the cement.

13:41.083 --> 13:43.208
Then we need to find another way

13:41.083 --> 13:43.208
to shut down the dome.

13:43.250 --> 13:44.875
I'll check the schematic.

13:44.917 --> 13:46.166
It should be

13:44.917 --> 13:46.166
on Doc's computer.

13:48.250 --> 13:49.875
What's Doc's

13:48.250 --> 13:49.875
secret password?

13:49.917 --> 13:51.792
Oh, right. "Doc."

13:51.834 --> 13:54.041
D-O-- Oops.

13:54.083 --> 13:57.208
Okay. Delete... Uh-oh.

13:57.250 --> 13:59.041
Uh, this could take a while.

13:59.083 --> 14:01.083
( siren blaring )

14:02.333 --> 14:03.583
It's over, Vigil.

14:08.083 --> 14:10.083
Please exit the stroller

14:08.083 --> 14:10.083
with your pudgy little arms

14:10.125 --> 14:11.417
above your oversized head.

14:13.500 --> 14:17.250
I am sorry, but I must

14:13.500 --> 14:17.250
complete one more task

14:17.291 --> 14:20.875
before Griffin Rock can be

14:17.291 --> 14:20.875
deemed permanently safe.

14:24.208 --> 14:25.667
( electricity crackles )

14:25.709 --> 14:27.208
( coos )

14:32.667 --> 14:35.417
(  dramatic theme playing  )

14:37.667 --> 14:40.458
What did he mean,

14:37.667 --> 14:40.458
one more task?

14:40.500 --> 14:43.458
There's somewhere specific

14:40.500 --> 14:43.458
he's trying to get to.

14:43.500 --> 14:46.166
Then why doesn't he just

14:43.500 --> 14:46.166
zap to wherever he's going?

14:46.208 --> 14:48.583
I don't think

14:46.208 --> 14:48.583
he can zap very far.

14:48.625 --> 14:50.875
Notice how he always

14:48.625 --> 14:50.875
gets really close

14:50.917 --> 14:52.125
before jumping tech?

14:52.166 --> 14:53.583
Vigil is headed east.

14:53.625 --> 14:55.917
Perhaps we can

14:53.625 --> 14:55.917
cut him off. Skyhawk?

14:55.959 --> 14:58.166
We copy, Blue Ninja.

14:55.959 --> 14:58.166
We're on it.

15:02.250 --> 15:03.834
Is that what I think it is?

15:03.875 --> 15:05.375
( beeping )

15:05.417 --> 15:07.750
GRAHAM:

15:05.417 --> 15:07.750
The dome has two sets

15:05.417 --> 15:07.750
of controls.

15:07.792 --> 15:10.417
Here, and the computer

15:07.792 --> 15:10.417
at Doc's lab.

15:10.458 --> 15:13.959
Doc must have built that in

15:10.458 --> 15:13.959
in case this panel failed.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.083
So we can override

15:14.000 --> 15:16.083
the dome from the lab,

15:16.125 --> 15:17.834
and Vigil knows it.

15:17.875 --> 15:21.250
Everyone, Vigil is

15:17.875 --> 15:21.250
heading for the lab.

15:21.291 --> 15:22.959
If he gets into Doc's

15:21.291 --> 15:22.959
central computer

15:23.000 --> 15:24.625
he'll control the dome,

15:24.667 --> 15:26.792
and the whole island.

15:26.834 --> 15:30.333
( all snoring )

15:37.875 --> 15:40.834

15:49.500 --> 15:52.000
Ow, ow, ow!

15:52.041 --> 15:53.375
Now what did I do wrong?

15:53.417 --> 15:56.834
It's not you-- Ow!

15:53.417 --> 15:56.834
It's him!

15:56.875 --> 15:59.375
My rotor!

15:56.875 --> 15:59.375
I'm losing control!

15:59.417 --> 16:01.250
Don't worry. I've got it.

16:01.291 --> 16:03.250
Ow! Don't oversteer.

You're not mixing

16:03.291 --> 16:05.250
cake batter.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.333
Vigil gets me

16:15.000 --> 16:18.333
so bent out of shape.

Hello, Francine.

( gasps )

16:23.333 --> 16:25.166

16:33.458 --> 16:35.500
Vigil's headed west

16:33.458 --> 16:35.500
inside a motorcycle,

16:35.542 --> 16:37.417
and we're grounded.

16:35.542 --> 16:37.417
Boulder and I

16:37.458 --> 16:39.291
are cutting through Sloan

16:37.458 --> 16:39.291
Field. We'll head him off.

16:39.333 --> 16:41.041
We're close too.

16:41.083 --> 16:42.667
Blades, Frankie,

16:41.083 --> 16:42.667
get to the lab on foot.

16:42.709 --> 16:44.083
We'll meet everybody there.

(  dramatic theme playing  )

16:49.792 --> 16:51.542
HEATWAVE:

16:49.792 --> 16:51.542
He ducked into

16:49.792 --> 16:51.542
the scrap yard.

16:51.583 --> 16:53.166
Ha! Now we got him.

16:58.083 --> 16:59.583
He's got to be here

16:58.083 --> 16:59.583
somewhere.

16:59.625 --> 17:02.166
More likely, in something.

16:59.625 --> 17:02.166
( electricity crackles )

17:02.208 --> 17:04.166
Whoa!

17:04.208 --> 17:05.208
Aah!

17:08.500 --> 17:10.542
Found him.

17:08.500 --> 17:10.542
Ya think?

17:10.583 --> 17:12.000
Cody, it's up

17:10.583 --> 17:12.000
to you guys.

17:12.041 --> 17:13.583
We're stuck

17:12.041 --> 17:13.583
at the scrap yard.

17:13.625 --> 17:16.208
CODY:

17:13.625 --> 17:16.208
Got it. We're almost

17:13.625 --> 17:16.208
to the lab. Frankie?

17:16.250 --> 17:18.750
( groaning )

17:18.792 --> 17:20.750
Blades is running

17:18.792 --> 17:20.750
as fast as he can,

17:20.792 --> 17:23.166
but he's a little out of shape.

17:23.208 --> 17:27.667
You try carrying me

17:23.208 --> 17:27.667
for a while.

17:27.709 --> 17:29.208
( siren blaring )

17:32.166 --> 17:34.125
( panting )

17:34.166 --> 17:37.250
Did we beat him here?

17:34.166 --> 17:37.250
Please say yes.

17:37.291 --> 17:40.041
It would appear so.

17:37.291 --> 17:40.041
I suggest a Bot blockade.

17:40.083 --> 17:41.542
Frankie,

17:40.083 --> 17:41.542
is the place locked up?

17:41.583 --> 17:44.291
I'll make sure. Dither?

17:44.333 --> 17:45.291
Yes?

17:45.333 --> 17:46.875
Seal all entrances

17:45.333 --> 17:46.875
to the lab.

17:56.417 --> 17:58.542
Step aside, please.

17:58.583 --> 18:00.458
You will have

17:58.583 --> 18:00.458
to go through us.

18:00.500 --> 18:01.917
Yeah!

18:01.959 --> 18:03.417
Go through what?

18:03.458 --> 18:05.875
I cannot allow you

18:03.458 --> 18:05.875
to jeopardize

18:05.917 --> 18:07.583
the safety

18:05.917 --> 18:07.583
of Griffin Rock.

18:07.625 --> 18:10.667
But what kind of town is it

18:07.625 --> 18:10.667
if everyone is asleep?

18:10.709 --> 18:13.000
A vigilant town.

18:14.834 --> 18:16.667
All entrances secured.

18:16.709 --> 18:18.500
No, Dither. Stay back!

18:18.542 --> 18:20.542
( electricity crackles )

18:20.583 --> 18:22.542
FRANKIE:

18:20.583 --> 18:22.542
He zapped into Dither!

18:22.583 --> 18:24.583
Don't let him get

18:22.583 --> 18:24.583
to the computer terminal.

18:24.625 --> 18:26.792
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

18:34.875 --> 18:36.959
Ew, ew!

18:38.667 --> 18:41.250
Ugh, is it just me,

18:41.291 --> 18:44.542
or are these foam cannons

18:41.291 --> 18:44.542
everywhere?

18:44.583 --> 18:47.500
I'm afraid-- Ugh!

18:44.583 --> 18:47.500
--we are incapacitated.

18:47.542 --> 18:50.166
Once in control

18:47.542 --> 18:50.166
of this central computer,

18:50.208 --> 18:54.959
I can keep Griffin Rock safe

18:50.208 --> 18:54.959
under the dome forever.

18:57.917 --> 18:59.000
Frankie, the rocket!

18:59.041 --> 19:00.417
Time for

18:59.041 --> 19:00.417
some goaltending?

19:00.458 --> 19:01.667
Hold your breath.

19:01.709 --> 19:03.375
( inhales deeply )

19:03.417 --> 19:05.792
Fly with fleet feet, Cody.

19:05.834 --> 19:08.083
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

19:10.917 --> 19:12.709
( gasps )

19:12.750 --> 19:14.375
It's up to you now.

19:14.417 --> 19:17.500
( yawns )

19:17.542 --> 19:19.500
( inhales deeply )

19:19.542 --> 19:21.166
Go, Frankie, go!

19:23.709 --> 19:25.625
Remember, don't oversteer.

19:32.667 --> 19:34.542
( electricity crackles )

19:37.458 --> 19:38.417
( gasps )

19:38.458 --> 19:40.041
Rejected!

19:40.083 --> 19:43.917
So long, Vigil.

19:40.083 --> 19:43.917
See you in the EMP Zone...

19:43.959 --> 19:46.917
(  dramatic theme playing  )

19:48.041 --> 19:52.959
Error, error, error...

19:53.000 --> 19:55.709
CHASE:

19:53.000 --> 19:55.709
The EMP Sector.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.709
The dead zone for tech.

19:55.750 --> 19:59.458
A sound strategy.

19:55.750 --> 19:59.458
But the humans are still asleep.

19:59.500 --> 20:01.709
Kind of peaceful,

19:59.500 --> 20:01.709
isn't it?

20:01.750 --> 20:03.750
But I do miss everyone.

20:03.792 --> 20:06.917
Dither?

20:03.792 --> 20:06.917
Yes?

20:06.959 --> 20:08.583
Retract the dome.

20:08.625 --> 20:09.583
Secret password:

20:09.625 --> 20:10.917
BOTH: Doc.

20:14.083 --> 20:15.834
(  dramatic theme playing  )

20:24.667 --> 20:27.667
( crowd murmuring )

20:30.500 --> 20:32.417
Ah... Ugh!

20:32.458 --> 20:33.959
( yawns )

20:34.000 --> 20:35.583
( chomping )

20:35.625 --> 20:37.583
( gasps )

20:37.625 --> 20:40.709
( grunts )

20:41.625 --> 20:44.458
( sighs )

20:44.500 --> 20:47.250
( both grunting )

20:51.667 --> 20:52.625
( sniffs ):

20:51.667 --> 20:52.625
Ah.

20:52.667 --> 20:54.208
Ah...

20:55.709 --> 20:56.959
( grunts )

20:59.667 --> 21:02.291
( snoring )

21:02.333 --> 21:04.625
( yawns )

21:04.667 --> 21:08.000
Mm, I had the weirdest dream.

21:08.041 --> 21:09.208
Did we miss something?

21:09.250 --> 21:13.417
Doc? Doc...

21:13.458 --> 21:16.291
Just five more minutes, Mama.

21:16.333 --> 21:17.875
( snoring )

21:20.000 --> 21:22.959
Why not?

21:20.000 --> 21:22.959
He deserves a good rest.

21:23.000 --> 21:27.542
Ooh, toast.

21:23.000 --> 21:27.542
Don't mind if I do.

21:27.583 --> 21:28.834
( giggles )

21:28.875 --> 21:30.625
Shh.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.875
