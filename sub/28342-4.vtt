00:01.221 --> 00:02.221
RICHARD SPLETT: Madam President,
Congressman Ryan,

00:02.513 --> 00:03.971
I have been appointed
the new Mayor of Lurline.

00:04.054 --> 00:06.138
-Oh, of course. I understand.
-Oh, I'll be sorry to lose you.

00:06.221 --> 00:07.346
Uh, me too.

00:08.513 --> 00:10.221
AMY BROOKHEIMER: Ma'am,
the U.S. Attorney's Office

00:10.305 --> 00:13.639
has impaneled a grand jury
to investigate the Meyer Fund.

00:13.722 --> 00:14.889
Madame P, got a moment?

00:14.971 --> 00:15.930
Can you fuck off?

00:16.013 --> 00:17.680
I have always tried
to be there for you.

00:17.764 --> 00:19.889
Well, how come you failed me
in algebra, Mr. Hennick?

00:19.971 --> 00:23.347
It would be really good if we
adopted another baby from China.

00:23.430 --> 00:25.388
How would you like the chance

00:25.472 --> 00:28.013
to help lead
a visibly repugnant underdog

00:28.096 --> 00:29.305
to historic victory?

00:29.597 --> 00:31.430
You want me to join
Jonah's campaign?

00:31.722 --> 00:33.055
SELINA MEYER: How about,
for once in your life,

00:33.138 --> 00:35.764
you stop whining,
you stop complaining,

00:35.847 --> 00:37.889
-and just man up?
-(APPLAUSE)

00:38.805 --> 00:39.847
(CHEERING)

00:40.138 --> 00:41.263
Get outta my way.

00:46.930 --> 00:51.013
Thank you, New Hampshire,
for manning up!

00:51.096 --> 00:56.597
What started in Iowa
with a come-from-behind,
second-place finish

00:56.680 --> 01:01.764
has built here tonight
into an all-out victory!

01:01.847 --> 01:03.180
( crowd cheering )

01:03.263 --> 01:06.263
And now it's on
to South Carolina

01:06.347 --> 01:10.263
and then back
to the White House!

01:10.347 --> 01:14.555
( recorded music playing )

01:14.639 --> 01:16.138
That's right, you heard me--

01:16.221 --> 01:18.347
back to the White House!

01:18.430 --> 01:21.138
( music, cheering )

01:21.221 --> 01:23.805
Selina on TV:
We're going back...

01:23.889 --> 01:26.513
Which one of you donkey-dongs
was in charge of the balloons?

01:26.597 --> 01:28.680
- Believe it or not, Amy.
- She's still fuckin' up?

01:28.764 --> 01:30.138
She hasn't worked here
for months!

01:30.221 --> 01:31.639
Does anyone have
her new email address?

01:31.722 --> 01:34.930
"Man up" continues
to resonate in all
four quadrants.

01:35.013 --> 01:38.263
It's universal. Men hate women,
women hate themselves.

01:38.347 --> 01:39.472
The Geraldine Ferraro
principle.

01:39.555 --> 01:40.847
Hey, ma'am, I was hoping

01:40.930 --> 01:43.013
I could have some
more responsibility--

01:43.096 --> 01:47.971
Yes. Can you make me
a waxing appointment
in Charleston?

01:48.055 --> 01:50.096
- I'm feeling patriotic.
- Full bald eagle.

01:50.180 --> 01:52.597
Ma'am, South Carolina
is gonna be tough.

01:52.680 --> 01:54.764
- Black people love me.
- Gary: Love.

01:54.847 --> 01:58.513
Did you know Dr. Jordan Thomas,
the civil rights leader,
he once said to me--

01:58.597 --> 02:00.263
- Ben: You told me this.
- Marjorie: We're aware.

02:00.347 --> 02:01.597
This is a classic.

02:01.680 --> 02:02.971
He once said to me

02:03.055 --> 02:07.180
that I was the blackest
white woman he ever met.

02:07.263 --> 02:08.930
Ben: Ma'am, you do know

02:09.013 --> 02:10.055
that this time you're running

02:10.138 --> 02:11.764
against an actual black person?

02:11.847 --> 02:13.138
Selina:
She's not even all-black.

02:13.221 --> 02:14.555
Plus, I'm gonna be

02:14.639 --> 02:17.430
Lion-Kinging
Little Richard all around

02:17.513 --> 02:18.764
till I tear my rotator cuff.

02:18.847 --> 02:20.221
Absolutely not, Mother.

02:20.305 --> 02:23.930
I have been working
for you for 18 years

02:24.013 --> 02:26.430
- without  a promotion.
- Right.

02:26.513 --> 02:28.472
But some people kinda
think I deserve

02:28.555 --> 02:30.388
a bigger role
in the campaign this time.

02:30.472 --> 02:32.263
What kind of role
was your mother thinking of?

02:32.347 --> 02:34.347
I thought everybody
kind of did the same thing.

02:34.430 --> 02:37.847
Ma'am, our faith-based outreach
program is kind of a disaster.

02:37.930 --> 02:40.055
OK, so give Gary
the face-based thing.

02:40.138 --> 02:42.805
- It's "faith-based."
- I don't care.

02:42.889 --> 02:44.847
I gotta get a little
shut-eye before we land.

02:44.930 --> 02:48.722
Can we have the lights out,
please? Thank you.

02:48.805 --> 02:51.388
Dan: Hey, Ben, do you have
the county-by-county--

02:51.472 --> 02:53.889
- Selina: No talking!
- Gary: No talking!

02:53.971 --> 02:56.096
- ( clatter )
- Selina: I'm hearing moving!

02:56.180 --> 02:59.889
( theme music playing )

02:59.971 --> 03:02.430
Jonah: I can't believe
I got sixth place.

03:02.513 --> 03:05.388
It is time for us
to head over to
the electoral scrapyard

03:05.472 --> 03:07.513
and see if we can sell
your endorsement for parts.

03:07.597 --> 03:10.055
OK, I'm gonna go hang myself
from a sturdy pipe,

03:10.138 --> 03:11.889
and I'm not even gonna
bother jacking off.

03:11.971 --> 03:15.971
- You have time
for a drink beforehand?
- Mmm.

03:16.055 --> 03:18.722
Nancy: Well, you're still
my  favorite son, Jonie.

03:18.805 --> 03:21.722
How does Butt-Buddy Calhoun
do one percent better than me?

03:21.805 --> 03:24.013
Well, you had three percent
and he had four,

03:24.096 --> 03:26.764
so actually,
he did 33% better.

03:26.847 --> 03:28.347
Don't math me, Lloyd.

03:28.430 --> 03:30.722
Math is a plot
invented by the Chinese

03:30.805 --> 03:33.055
to make smart Americans
feel dumb.

03:33.138 --> 03:36.096
Modern math was invented
by Islamic scholars
in the 7th century.

03:36.180 --> 03:39.722
( mocking ) You  were invented
by Islamic scholars
in the 7th century.

03:39.805 --> 03:41.680
( laughing ) Burn.
Sorry, Dad.

03:41.764 --> 03:44.263
Okay, Jonie, please,
don't yell at Lloyd.
Please, he's just--

03:44.347 --> 03:45.680
Sorry, what is that
on your finger?

03:45.764 --> 03:46.889
- Is that a ring?
- Lloyd: Well,

03:46.971 --> 03:49.597
I asked your mom
to marry me again,

03:49.680 --> 03:51.138
and I'm hoping we can
get your blessing.

03:51.221 --> 03:56.138
- No! You don't have it--
- ( man laughing )

03:59.430 --> 04:02.597
Oh! Saint Theresa's
gray-haired gunt,

04:02.680 --> 04:05.764
they're fucking again?!

04:05.847 --> 04:07.055
I'm sorry I'm late.

04:07.138 --> 04:08.930
The Meyer victory party's
still raging.

04:09.013 --> 04:11.013
They got some great coke.

04:11.096 --> 04:13.847
I can't believe you backed
another candidate, Uncle Judas.

04:13.930 --> 04:16.055
- When I'm president--
- Shut the fuck up!

04:16.137 --> 04:17.555
When you're president?!

04:17.639 --> 04:19.512
I'll jam my fist
up my dick hole

04:19.596 --> 04:23.347
and pull out a 40-piece
set of Danish cutlery
when you're president!

04:23.430 --> 04:25.764
Selina Meyer is
a legitimate candidate,

04:25.847 --> 04:28.096
not a human pool skimmer

04:28.180 --> 04:32.597
last used to de-spunk
a Provincetown hot tub party!

04:32.680 --> 04:34.138
Congratulations, Sis.

04:34.221 --> 04:35.930
Let me know
where to send the gift.

04:36.013 --> 04:38.930
Spoiler alert:
It's Danish cutlery.

04:39.013 --> 04:42.013
Thanks, Jeff.
See ya in church
on Sunday.

04:43.847 --> 04:46.013
Gary? I need my tea.

04:46.096 --> 04:47.971
Marjorie:
And a well-done
egg white frittata.

04:48.055 --> 04:49.221
Here you are, ma'am.

04:49.305 --> 04:51.096
Whoa. That startled me.

04:51.180 --> 04:52.347
Why are you Gary?

04:52.430 --> 04:54.680
He had an early
morning meeting.

04:54.764 --> 04:57.764
You can't just replace Gary
with another lesbian

04:57.847 --> 04:59.930
and think that
I'm not gonna notice what--

05:00.013 --> 05:04.597
Mmm. Wow, this tea is
the perfect  temperature.

05:04.680 --> 05:06.971
Thank you, ma'am.
I learned from
an Afghani warlord.

05:07.055 --> 05:08.513
We should put him
on the payroll.

05:08.597 --> 05:10.971
- You killed him
in a drone strike.
- Oh, well.

05:11.055 --> 05:12.847
I laid out your outfit
for the day.

05:12.930 --> 05:15.138
Oh. Oh, wow!

05:15.221 --> 05:17.722
I never thought before
to put the Bottega pumps

05:17.805 --> 05:19.263
with the Michael Kors top.

05:19.347 --> 05:21.305
You've been taking
fashion advice from a man

05:21.388 --> 05:23.221
who dresses like an overgrown
ventriloquist dummy.

05:23.305 --> 05:25.597
That's a solid point.

05:25.680 --> 05:28.013
- Oh! Is this edible?
- No, ma'am.

05:28.096 --> 05:29.472
Oh. Uhh.

05:29.555 --> 05:33.597
- ( knocking )
- Gary: Hello.

05:33.680 --> 05:36.138
- Mr. Walsh. I'm Blake Stein.
- Nice to meet you.

05:36.221 --> 05:38.680
- We're all ready to--
- Ahh! Yep. Yeah. Perfect.

05:38.764 --> 05:40.013
Did you see the spread
that I ordered?

05:40.096 --> 05:42.263
These are fresh bagels
from New York,

05:42.347 --> 05:45.096
which I'm very excited about
'cause the president
hates bagels--

05:45.180 --> 05:48.347
shh-shh-shh--
and she can't even be
in the same room with donuts.

05:48.430 --> 05:49.680
Uh, so why don't we get started?

05:49.764 --> 05:51.971
Of course, of course,
I've love that.

05:52.055 --> 05:56.180
I would love that.

05:56.263 --> 06:00.096
Here we go. ( chuckles )

06:05.138 --> 06:06.722
- ( whispers ) Mr. Walsh.
- Yeah?

06:06.805 --> 06:08.805
This is your meeting.
You're in charge.

06:08.889 --> 06:13.680
Oh, I know. I know. I know.

06:13.764 --> 06:16.055
Of course.

06:16.138 --> 06:18.597
Can I make anyone a plate?

06:20.597 --> 06:22.305
( knock on door )

06:22.388 --> 06:23.639
What up, Mojo?

06:23.722 --> 06:24.847
When are you and I gonna have

06:24.930 --> 06:25.971
that pussy-eating contest?

06:26.055 --> 06:27.138
You have ten minutes.

06:27.221 --> 06:29.055
I started timing
the moment you knocked.

06:29.138 --> 06:32.305
- Amy: Ma'am! So good
to see you again.
- Amy!

06:32.388 --> 06:34.513
How is that baby?
Must be gettin' big.

06:34.597 --> 06:37.055
It's great. So the reason
that we are here is...

06:37.138 --> 06:40.347
- Yeah.
- Congressman Ryan
is considering stepping aside

06:40.430 --> 06:42.013
- and endorsing you--
- I want vice president.

06:42.096 --> 06:43.388
- That's not negotiable.
- Let's go.

06:43.472 --> 06:44.597
No, I'm willing to negotiate.

06:44.680 --> 06:46.388
What about Department
of the Exterior?

06:46.472 --> 06:49.180
- Interior.
- We're gonna negotiate
against ourselves now, Amy?

06:49.263 --> 06:51.805
Amy, Amy, I mean...

06:51.889 --> 06:54.138
( Selina laughs ) Oh, God.

06:54.221 --> 06:57.555
If Ellen had
a little sister from China,

06:57.639 --> 06:59.513
it might help her
bond with... Mike.

06:59.597 --> 07:02.513
Or, uh, I could bond
with the new one.

07:02.597 --> 07:04.555
Tell 'em about
your big new job, Mike.

07:04.639 --> 07:05.847
Oh, gosh, yeah!

07:05.930 --> 07:08.013
I have my own webcast
on BuzzFeed.

07:08.096 --> 07:11.221
I call it "McLintalk."
A-L-K?

07:11.305 --> 07:13.597
It would be funny
if you were American.

07:13.680 --> 07:16.221
So, is--
is everything all right?

07:16.305 --> 07:18.555
Just one last question,
Mr. McLintock,

07:18.639 --> 07:21.764
are you still close
with President Selina Meyer?

07:21.847 --> 07:24.597
Full disclosure:
She still doesn't like
when I eat in front of her.

07:24.680 --> 07:26.555
- Very good. Very good!
- Wendy: Very good!

07:26.639 --> 07:28.722
Gang-Hua Li:
If you will just
head down the hallway,

07:28.805 --> 07:30.180
we will have you sign
the application.

07:30.263 --> 07:32.096
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

07:32.180 --> 07:34.221
- Mr. McLintock.
- Yeah?

07:34.305 --> 07:39.138
I was wondering if you
could deliver a message
to President Meyer for me?

07:39.221 --> 07:42.013
Remembering things
and reporting them back
to people is not my strong suit,

07:42.096 --> 07:43.680
but I could write it down.

07:43.764 --> 07:45.055
Please don't write it down.

07:45.138 --> 07:47.263
O-kay.

07:47.347 --> 07:50.263
Jordan Thomas:
My father started this youth
center for one reason:

07:50.347 --> 07:51.513
You gotta keep
the kids off the streets.

07:51.597 --> 07:53.138
That's right. Gangs and--

07:53.221 --> 07:55.180
What you need is more
police protection.

07:55.263 --> 07:58.472
As you know, the police
are doing most of the shootings.

07:58.555 --> 08:00.347
Yeah, well, the police
are out of control.

08:00.430 --> 08:01.971
- Let me give you
the rest of the tour.
- OK.

08:02.055 --> 08:03.805
- Huh?!
- Marjorie: Ma'am,

08:03.889 --> 08:06.347
last month a local
eight-year-old boy
was shot by police

08:06.430 --> 08:08.347
when his candy bar
was mistaken for a gun.

08:08.430 --> 08:09.805
And how was I
supposed to know that?

08:09.889 --> 08:11.221
It was in today's
Line-By-Line.

08:11.305 --> 08:12.597
You know I don't read
what you give me.

08:12.680 --> 08:14.013
Jordan: Thought I lost you!

08:14.096 --> 08:15.680
Let's continue the tour.
Come on, kids are waiting.

08:15.764 --> 08:18.138
Selina: Your father
was such a great man,

08:18.221 --> 08:21.013
and you have inherited
not only his good looks,

08:21.096 --> 08:22.555
but also his charisma!

08:22.639 --> 08:24.680
Now I'm blushin'
and a little bit crushin'.

08:24.764 --> 08:27.138
I would really love
to be able to count on

08:27.221 --> 08:29.305
your endorsement
this time around.

08:29.388 --> 08:30.680
- Really?
- Yeah.

08:30.764 --> 08:33.513
- You're gonna
make me say it?
- Say what?

08:33.597 --> 08:35.304
( laughs ) She gonna
make me say it!

08:35.388 --> 08:37.263
We've got a sister
runnin', ya know.

08:37.347 --> 08:39.472
We got race in the race.
Praise Jesus!

08:39.554 --> 08:41.847
Yes. Indeedy. I, you know,

08:41.929 --> 08:43.889
( sing-songy ) Progress!

08:43.971 --> 08:47.639
But your daddy used
to say to me

08:47.722 --> 08:50.347
that I was the blackest
white woman he ever met.

08:50.430 --> 08:51.680
Can I tell you something?

08:51.764 --> 08:53.764
My dad said that
to a lot of white women.

08:53.847 --> 08:57.513
That was his move.
( laughing )
Now you know.

08:57.597 --> 08:59.971
Oh. I would love to see you
at services on Sunday,

09:00.055 --> 09:02.597
and I would love it if you
would speak to the congregation.

09:02.680 --> 09:04.472
Well, I'm-- I'm, uh,

09:04.555 --> 09:06.930
I'm pretty booked up.
No. Just take it away.

09:09.263 --> 09:11.013
Amy: Senator Talbot,

09:11.096 --> 09:12.513
we believe you are positioned

09:12.597 --> 09:13.680
to win the nomination,

09:13.764 --> 09:15.388
and we might be considering

09:15.472 --> 09:17.555
suspending
Congressman Ryan's campaign.

09:17.639 --> 09:18.889
Definitely the right move.

09:18.971 --> 09:19.889
K-Jazz.

09:19.971 --> 09:21.221
Ask me what's on my mind.

09:21.305 --> 09:23.639
Fine. What's on your mind,
Congressman Ryan?

09:23.722 --> 09:25.221
I'm glad you asked,

09:25.305 --> 09:28.096
because my mind's
on my money...

09:28.180 --> 09:30.221
and my money's on my mind.

09:30.305 --> 09:32.805
Laid back.

09:34.305 --> 09:35.472
Jonah:
I thought she'd be more--

09:35.555 --> 09:38.138
I thought you'd
be more familiar.

09:38.221 --> 09:39.388
I mean, did you
at least watch Martin?

09:39.472 --> 09:41.180
- "Damn, Gina!"
- We should go.

09:41.263 --> 09:43.472
- What? She asked.
- Just let us know
if we can be of any help.

09:43.555 --> 09:45.889
Could you give me HUD?
Nobody cares about it.

09:45.971 --> 09:48.221
It's like the fat girl
of Cabinet posts.

09:48.305 --> 09:52.305
Ma'am, the new
anti-Kemi mail pieces
just came in.

09:52.388 --> 09:54.930
What the tragic mulatto fuck?

09:55.013 --> 09:56.639
Kemi looks like an albino.

09:56.722 --> 09:59.263
And I'm so black,
people are gonna start
calling me articulate.

09:59.347 --> 10:01.930
Hey, ma'am.
Presenting my first
faith-based outreach video.

10:02.013 --> 10:03.096
- Man: Outreach. Reaching out.
- No.

10:03.180 --> 10:04.430
Okay.

10:04.513 --> 10:06.805
Look, guys, if we're not
getting the black vote,

10:06.889 --> 10:09.305
then we have to take
a hard turn to the white.

10:09.388 --> 10:12.055
Kent, how are we doing with
non-college-educated whites?

10:12.138 --> 10:13.347
- Look at this.
- Kent: Underwater, ma'am.

10:13.430 --> 10:15.305
Then how about
college-educated whites?

10:15.388 --> 10:16.597
Uh, in South Carolina,

10:16.680 --> 10:19.388
that is not a significant
slice of the pie.

10:19.472 --> 10:20.764
Then we're gonna
have to find a way

10:20.847 --> 10:22.722
with non-college-educated
whites.

10:22.805 --> 10:24.597
Like, what appeals to them--

10:24.680 --> 10:26.263
What appeals to them?
What do they want?

10:26.347 --> 10:29.430
Well, my polling shows
their main wants are jobs,

10:29.513 --> 10:31.180
education, and an adequate
safety net--

10:31.263 --> 10:33.805
- Okay, not gonna speak to that.
- I'm not finished, ma'am.

10:33.889 --> 10:36.180
"...to be denied
to African Americans."

10:36.263 --> 10:38.639
- ( Gary's video playing )
- My video could help, actually.

10:38.722 --> 10:39.847
- No!
- ( gasps )

10:39.971 --> 10:42.013
Listen, we have to find a way

10:42.096 --> 10:45.180
to say those things
without actually saying them.

10:45.263 --> 10:47.555
- Like a dog whistle.
- Yes, exactly!

10:47.639 --> 10:49.764
Okay. You know what?
You could talk about charter
schools. Mention something--

10:49.847 --> 10:51.305
Come on, that's
like a dog whisper.

10:51.388 --> 10:53.472
You could "reject"
an endorsement

10:53.555 --> 10:55.430
from a pro-Confederacy group.

10:55.513 --> 10:58.555
That's like a dog
exploding space shuttle.

10:58.639 --> 11:01.930
- I need something loud,
not too loud like--
- Dog chainsaw?

11:02.013 --> 11:05.013
- No, that's too droney.
- Marjorie: A dog snowmobile.

11:05.096 --> 11:07.305
Why would I know what that even
sounds like? I mean, seriously.

11:07.388 --> 11:09.305
- I'm sorry, ma'am.
- A dog leaf blower?

11:09.388 --> 11:11.430
- Yeah, I like that. Yes.
- That's right.

11:11.513 --> 11:13.263
- Steady.
- ...exactly like
a dog chainsaw--

11:13.347 --> 11:17.472
- ( all arguing indistinctly )
- ( Gary's video playing )

11:17.555 --> 11:19.930
Okay, this is closed.
I don't know-- this is closed.

11:20.013 --> 11:21.889
Wait a minute--
what is Gary doing here?

11:21.971 --> 11:23.597
This is my first strategic
meeting at the big table.

11:23.680 --> 11:25.180
Okay, guys,
what you need to do

11:25.263 --> 11:27.889
is get me in front
of huge white audiences.

11:27.971 --> 11:29.680
Huge. Huge.

11:29.764 --> 11:31.430
Something that makes
a NASCAR race look

11:31.513 --> 11:33.180
like a Jay-Z concert, you know?

11:33.263 --> 11:35.472
Actually, ma'am, Jay-Z concerts
are almost all white people.

11:35.555 --> 11:37.180
Okay, well, right? I know.

11:37.263 --> 11:38.889
Mike:
Hey, guys! Big news.

11:38.971 --> 11:40.930
Wendy and I are adopting
another Chinese baby.

11:41.013 --> 11:42.680
Where are you registered?
Child Protective Services?

11:42.764 --> 11:44.263
No, Gymboree.

11:44.347 --> 11:45.847
I love that they make clothes
in your size now, Mike.

11:45.930 --> 11:47.597
- Oh, gosh, ma'am. I forgot.
- Yeah?

11:47.680 --> 11:48.971
The guy at the Chinese consulate

11:49.055 --> 11:51.180
said he had a message
for you from President Liu.

11:51.263 --> 11:53.013
Wait, what?

11:53.096 --> 11:54.971
He said, "President Liu
is watching the election

11:55.055 --> 11:58.013
with great interest and hopes
to return to your conversation

11:58.096 --> 12:00.805
about the Diaoyu Islands
in the near future.

12:00.889 --> 12:04.971
Hey, can you go look at,
uh, Gary's faith video?

12:05.055 --> 12:06.847
- Yeah, we need some help.
- Oh, sure.

12:06.930 --> 12:09.555
- You need the McLintock spin?
- Sure.

12:09.639 --> 12:10.764
Oh, hey, ma'am,
you got a moment?

12:10.847 --> 12:12.555
- Selina: No.
- Copy that.

12:12.639 --> 12:15.263
What the fuck was-- out!

12:18.930 --> 12:20.221
What was that?!

12:20.305 --> 12:22.722
Liu sent you
a message inside Mike.

12:22.805 --> 12:24.221
A misfortune cookie.

12:24.305 --> 12:26.347
Who cares about
an island that doesn't have

12:26.430 --> 12:27.555
a Four Seasons on it?

12:27.639 --> 12:29.180
The Diaoyu Islands
are important

12:29.263 --> 12:31.805
to the Chinese militarily,
but the United States

12:31.889 --> 12:34.430
still does not recognize them
as Chinese territory.

12:34.513 --> 12:37.639
Surely Liu recognizes
that I can't recognize

12:37.722 --> 12:40.347
diddly-squat, unless...

12:40.430 --> 12:41.472
You become President.

12:41.555 --> 12:43.388
So what? You think that Liu

12:43.472 --> 12:44.847
is trying to help me become--

12:44.971 --> 12:46.680
Don't finish
that sentence, ma'am.

12:46.764 --> 12:49.971
We can't have this discussion.
We are still a nation of laws.

12:50.055 --> 12:51.305
- "Ish."
- "Esque."

12:51.388 --> 12:52.847
Of course, but let's be clear

12:52.930 --> 12:55.430
about what we're
not talking about.

12:55.513 --> 12:59.263
Okay? We are not talking
about letting the Chinese

12:59.347 --> 13:01.764
influence our
presidential election,

13:01.847 --> 13:03.722
and certainly not in exchange

13:03.805 --> 13:05.764
for me recognizing
those islands.

13:05.847 --> 13:07.597
And, since it is
not being discussed,

13:07.680 --> 13:09.055
then I do not have to mention

13:09.138 --> 13:11.013
that you cannot
trust the Chinese.

13:11.096 --> 13:16.096
And they will not sell
you out in a Beijing minute.

13:16.180 --> 13:18.472
Wait, they will or they won't?

13:18.555 --> 13:19.764
I don't know.

13:19.847 --> 13:22.221
Well, I mean, can't we "not"

13:22.305 --> 13:26.096
not do the thing
that we're not talking about?

13:26.180 --> 13:27.639
I'm totally lost.

13:27.722 --> 13:30.055
Do you think Captain Lady
Kangaroo heard any of that?

13:30.138 --> 13:31.971
- I don't think so.
- No? Okay, good.

13:32.055 --> 13:34.221
Fire her anyway just to be sure.

13:34.305 --> 13:36.639
Consider her green-jeaned,
ma'am.

13:36.722 --> 13:38.388
- Oh, ma'am, big news--
- Yeah?

13:38.472 --> 13:40.764
- Tom James called.
He wants a meeting.
- Is he dropping out?

13:40.847 --> 13:42.764
A James endorsement right now
would be a game changer.

13:42.847 --> 13:47.639
Selina: Set it up.
I wanna see Tommy beg.

13:47.722 --> 13:50.055
So, how's Little Richard
doing with solid foods?

13:50.138 --> 13:52.472
Don't ask me, ask her.
Apparently, she's in charge
of him now.

13:52.555 --> 13:53.805
Catherine,
please don't this.

13:53.889 --> 13:56.805
You stole our baby
and you took him to church.

13:56.889 --> 13:58.472
He saw a male Jesus.

13:58.555 --> 13:59.764
When my uncle stole me,

13:59.847 --> 14:01.138
I don't remember
where he took me,

14:01.221 --> 14:02.722
but I do have
this recurring dream

14:02.805 --> 14:04.472
where I almost find out.

14:04.555 --> 14:05.971
Richard, what's that noise?

14:06.055 --> 14:09.180
Oh, it's a crop duster.
They usually fly pretty low.

14:09.263 --> 14:10.971
- Can you say "airplane?"
- Richard: Not that low.

14:11.055 --> 14:12.639
- Oh, sweet male Jesus!
- Passerby: ( panicked yelling )

14:12.722 --> 14:14.388
Marjorie and Catherine:
Richard?

14:14.472 --> 14:16.263
- Marjorie: Are you okay?
- ( crop duster crashes )

14:17.597 --> 14:18.805
( knocking on door )

14:18.889 --> 14:21.472
Gary. You're growing your hair.

14:21.555 --> 14:23.513
That's an amusing joke,
Senator James.

14:23.597 --> 14:25.180
Senator, hello.

14:25.263 --> 14:26.472
Tom James:
Madam President.

14:26.555 --> 14:28.347
Marjorie, thanks very much.
You can leave.

14:28.430 --> 14:31.764
Or I could stay.
Uh, for safety's sake.
I'm a model of discretion.

14:31.847 --> 14:33.555
Oh, you can be discreet
out in the hallway.

14:36.513 --> 14:38.764
You just left her
in there? With him?

14:38.847 --> 14:40.138
I was following orders.

14:40.221 --> 14:41.680
So was Hitler.

14:41.764 --> 14:43.680
Marjorie, there's something
that you need to see.

14:43.764 --> 14:45.722
Catherine,
Little Richard is not sick.

14:45.805 --> 14:47.263
Please stop taking
his temperature.

14:47.347 --> 14:49.138
No, it's big Richard.

14:49.221 --> 14:52.764
( yelps ) ( whimpers )

14:52.847 --> 14:55.180
Reporter: I'm here reporting
from Lurlene, Iowa,

14:55.263 --> 14:56.971
where earlier today an airplane

14:57.055 --> 14:59.096
crashed
into the local 7-Eleven.

14:59.180 --> 15:01.722
Miraculously,
there were no fatalities,

15:01.805 --> 15:03.889
due in no small part
to the heroics

15:03.971 --> 15:06.889
of Lurlene's own mayor,
Richard Splett.

15:06.971 --> 15:08.971
Mayor Splett, what happened?

15:09.055 --> 15:11.472
Uh, well, a crop duster
clipped a power line

15:11.555 --> 15:13.388
and bumped
into a local 7-Eleven.

15:13.472 --> 15:15.971
We're working with FEMA to
bring in emergency supplies
and cigarettes.

15:16.055 --> 15:17.221
I've never been more proud
I taught that man

15:17.305 --> 15:18.889
to ejaculate into a cup.

15:18.971 --> 15:21.639
Selina:
All right, Senator James,
what's it gonna be?

15:21.722 --> 15:24.138
I've heard you had
a yen for Treasury.

15:24.221 --> 15:26.680
I think a lot of my supporters
would actually think

15:26.764 --> 15:28.805
that State was more appropriate.

15:28.889 --> 15:30.971
Ouch. Things are
that bad at home, huh?

15:31.055 --> 15:35.472
Let's just say a few
international tours would
ease domestic tensions.

15:35.555 --> 15:40.805
( laughs ) Well,
it's pretty early days, though.

15:40.889 --> 15:43.597
You know, and still
moving pieces around--

15:43.680 --> 15:49.096
Foggy Bottom is a pretty big
plum to be giving away so soon.

15:49.180 --> 15:51.805
Although Secretary of State
is only really powerful

15:51.889 --> 15:57.138
if he or she has a close
personal relationship
with the president.

15:57.221 --> 16:00.555
I don't know. Tom,
I have to tell you,
I'm really not convinced.

16:00.639 --> 16:04.430
Well, if you like,
I could walk you through
my foreign policy ideas.

16:04.513 --> 16:07.013
You familiar with
"peace through strength"?

16:07.096 --> 16:10.847
Oh. Keep talkin' like Reagan,
I'll work it like Nancy.

16:12.000 --> 16:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

16:19.388 --> 16:23.971
- Buddy: Congressman.
- Governor. Were you followed?

16:24.055 --> 16:26.180
I don't know.

16:26.263 --> 16:28.305
So, what would you offer me

16:28.388 --> 16:32.305
as far as a cabinet position
in exchange for my endorsement?

16:32.388 --> 16:35.221
Whoops. I guess we
got ourselves

16:35.305 --> 16:37.221
a "Gift of the Magi"
situation here.

16:37.305 --> 16:39.639
I was gonna ask you
for the same thing.

16:39.722 --> 16:40.722
Wait, you're dropping out?

16:40.805 --> 16:42.889
Maybe. Maybe not.

16:42.971 --> 16:45.305
But I was gonna ask you
for Secretary of Interior.

16:45.388 --> 16:47.597
Were you gonna ask for Interior
and then settle for HUD?

16:47.680 --> 16:51.096
Dang it. So busted.

16:51.180 --> 16:53.889
( chuckles )
Hey, is that Amy?

16:53.971 --> 16:55.597
Oh, she said to say no.

16:55.680 --> 16:58.597
- Oh.
- Amy: Get in the car.

16:58.680 --> 17:00.180
No, yeah,
that's definitely Amy.

17:00.263 --> 17:01.472
Oh, all right.

17:01.555 --> 17:03.180
- See you later, man. Yeah.
- Good luck, bro.

17:03.263 --> 17:04.722
Selina:
Oh, morning, boys.

17:04.805 --> 17:06.221
All: Morning, ma'am.

17:06.305 --> 17:08.221
Our good friend Tom James
just called a press conference.

17:08.305 --> 17:10.387
- Oh, has he now? Wow.
- Dan: Yes.

17:10.472 --> 17:11.512
I need fruit.

17:11.597 --> 17:12.847
- On it.
- On it. I'm on it.

17:12.930 --> 17:14.221
- Ma'am?
- Selina: Yeah?

17:14.305 --> 17:16.012
Please tell me you didn't
promise him State?

17:16.096 --> 17:18.847
There is no way
I would appoint anyone
competent to anything

17:18.930 --> 17:20.221
in my cabinet.

17:20.305 --> 17:23.221
Morning. Thank you
for coming. Hope I can...

17:23.305 --> 17:24.805
Cloud berries
are organic and Icelandic.

17:24.888 --> 17:26.055
How lovely.

17:26.137 --> 17:28.597
I have decided
to suspend my campaign

17:28.680 --> 17:30.138
for President
of the United States.

17:30.221 --> 17:33.930
- Aww, no. Tom, say it ain't so.
- ( all groaning )

17:34.013 --> 17:36.513
Reporter: Will you be
making an endorsement?

17:36.597 --> 17:40.680
I'd like to give my strongest
and most full-throated support

17:40.764 --> 17:44.388
to the person who has proven
time and time again

17:44.472 --> 17:45.555
to be a born leader.

17:45.639 --> 17:47.889
I wonder who that could be.

17:47.971 --> 17:49.347
I don't know who that is.

17:49.430 --> 17:50.889
( all laughing )

17:50.971 --> 17:53.639
...but unfortunately that
candidate has not yet emerged

17:53.722 --> 17:56.055
and shows no sign of doing so.

17:56.138 --> 17:58.639
- Huh?
- Tom: These are early days.

17:58.722 --> 18:00.889
There's a lot of moving pieces,

18:00.971 --> 18:02.305
- but I will not be
endorsing just yet.
- No, no, no, no. What?!

18:02.388 --> 18:03.639
Thank you,
and God bless America.

18:03.722 --> 18:05.805
He just fucked me
right in the ass!

18:05.889 --> 18:07.722
Son of a bitch
wouldn't endorse you.

18:07.805 --> 18:10.971
- That, too!
- Ma'am, it's time to just
give up on South Carolina.

18:11.055 --> 18:13.388
- No, no! Move, move!
- ( all arguing indistinctly )

18:13.472 --> 18:18.180
Are you kidding me?
We can't let Kemi get
a foothold in South Carolina.

18:18.263 --> 18:22.096
Think! Oh, I'll--

18:22.180 --> 18:25.096
You call Dr. Thomas
and you tell him, yeah,

18:25.180 --> 18:26.930
I'll speak before his
congregation tomorrow.

18:27.013 --> 18:28.764
Ma'am, we need white voters.

18:28.847 --> 18:30.388
- I mean that's,
that's not gonna work.
- Selina: Yeah.

18:30.472 --> 18:32.764
It will if I give a speech
in support

18:32.847 --> 18:35.805
of local law enforcement
and that cop who killed

18:35.889 --> 18:37.971
that kid who threatened him
with the candy bar!

18:38.055 --> 18:41.722
Wh-- okay, so you wanna blow
a dog whistle in a black church?

18:41.805 --> 18:44.889
I mean, that's like blowing
a rape whistle while you're
raping somebody.

18:44.971 --> 18:47.180
- Exactly.
- Speak truth to powerless.

18:47.263 --> 18:49.055
I like that very much.
Write that down, Leon.

18:49.138 --> 18:50.597
- I will do that.
- Here's the fruit.

18:50.680 --> 18:53.680
Honeydew? If I wanna pretend
to be in the CNN green room,

18:53.764 --> 18:57.597
I'll draw a face
on Ben's ass and call that
Christiane Amanpour.

18:57.680 --> 18:59.263
Tanz:
Jonah-lah!

18:59.347 --> 19:01.930
What's this meshugas  about
you dropping out of the race?

19:02.013 --> 19:03.680
That can't happen. Chicken?

19:03.764 --> 19:05.388
Mr. Tanz, they say that
I have no chance of winning.

19:05.472 --> 19:07.055
Who said anything about winning?

19:07.138 --> 19:08.971
You. I thought you said
I was gonna be president.

19:09.055 --> 19:10.513
No, you did. ( chuckles )

19:10.597 --> 19:13.180
Made me chuckle every time.
I never thought you could win.

19:13.263 --> 19:14.930
Well, then why the fuck
am I running, sir?

19:15.013 --> 19:16.305
As terribly as you're doing,

19:16.388 --> 19:18.013
you're still winning delegates.

19:18.096 --> 19:19.971
Mostly crazy cuckoos,

19:20.055 --> 19:22.263
but you multiply that
by fifty states,

19:22.347 --> 19:24.805
I can force the party
to make some tweaks

19:24.889 --> 19:26.597
to the platform
at the convention.

19:26.680 --> 19:29.472
Stricter marijuana laws!
Ta-da!

19:29.555 --> 19:31.263
I need potheads
in my prisons.

19:31.347 --> 19:33.472
Otherwise it's just
murderers and rapists.

19:33.555 --> 19:35.805
It makes for a very
unpleasant atmosphere.

19:35.889 --> 19:37.597
I wish I'd aborted myself.

19:37.680 --> 19:39.555
Wait, so no one's really
trying to make me president?

19:39.639 --> 19:42.639
- No.
- Wait, so this is all just
to keep The Chronic illegal?

19:42.722 --> 19:44.138
Now he gets it! Plus,

19:44.221 --> 19:46.722
I need more casino
licenses for Macau.

19:46.805 --> 19:48.221
I know it sounds
a little specific,

19:48.305 --> 19:50.639
but in the end it'll
benefit all Americans.

19:50.722 --> 19:52.263
Toodle-oo!

19:52.347 --> 19:54.597
Dr. Jordan Thomas Jr.:
President Selina Meyer.

19:54.680 --> 19:56.347
- Hello, Reverend.
- Good for you, girl.

19:56.430 --> 19:57.680
I can't believe you did this.

19:57.764 --> 19:59.013
- Yeah.
- You don't quit.

19:59.096 --> 20:01.013
- No, I don't.
- Oh, I like that.

20:01.096 --> 20:02.388
- Do you? Okay. Good.
- I do.

20:02.472 --> 20:04.513
- And I love that little hat.
- Thank you.

20:04.597 --> 20:06.597
Yeah, this whole
congregation's gonna love
that little hat. ( laughs )

20:06.680 --> 20:11.221
( chuckles ) Oh, God,
I think he has a crush on me.

20:11.305 --> 20:12.764
- Yeah.
- He does not, ma'am.

20:12.847 --> 20:13.889
Oh, come on.

20:13.971 --> 20:15.930
I appreciate
your honesty, Marjorie.

20:16.013 --> 20:18.221
- Okay.
- I mean, not that it matters.

20:18.305 --> 20:22.013
He certainly isn't gonna
after I read this manifesto.

20:22.096 --> 20:23.555
Permission to roll
your breasts, ma'am?

20:23.639 --> 20:25.013
Oh, granted.

20:27.347 --> 20:28.388
Dr. Jordan Thomas, Jr.:
Good morning, everybody.

20:28.472 --> 20:29.722
Congregation:
Good morning.

20:29.805 --> 20:31.889
Uh, we have
a special guest today.

20:31.971 --> 20:34.764
I'm pretty sure
that you can imagine

20:34.847 --> 20:38.221
that I'm a firm supporter
of the separation
of church and state.

20:38.305 --> 20:40.055
( congregation
exclaiming agreement )

20:40.138 --> 20:42.805
- Because this is
the Lord's house.
- ( all exclaiming agreement )

20:42.889 --> 20:44.138
Not the White House.

20:44.221 --> 20:46.555
But soon to be
the "Black House."

20:46.639 --> 20:49.430
( al cheering )

20:49.513 --> 20:52.472
Brothers and sisters, please
welcome President Selina Meyer.

20:52.555 --> 20:54.847
Thank you. Thank you, Reverend.

20:54.930 --> 20:56.180
Mm-hmm.

20:56.263 --> 20:58.430
- Good morning.
- Congregation: Good morning.

20:58.513 --> 21:04.305
I don't need to tell you that
church is a special place.

21:04.388 --> 21:05.805
Dr. Jordan Thomas, Jr.:
That's right.

21:05.889 --> 21:08.805
But it's also a place
for truth, isn't it?

21:08.889 --> 21:10.764
That's right. That's right.

21:10.847 --> 21:14.764
And what happened recently
in your community

21:14.847 --> 21:18.138
to that young boy is very sad.

21:18.221 --> 21:19.639
Congregation: Mm-hmm.

21:19.722 --> 21:23.513
But here's the hard truth.

21:23.597 --> 21:27.305
- There are many victims here.
- ( muttering )

21:27.388 --> 21:30.722
Seina: And you might not
wanna hear this.

21:33.597 --> 21:38.263
But the real victims
are the police...

21:38.347 --> 21:40.096
( muttering )

21:40.180 --> 21:43.263
..."ing."

21:43.347 --> 21:49.263
Policing... that America
does in the South China Sea.

21:49.347 --> 21:50.930
That's right. I went there.

21:51.013 --> 21:54.513
It is time for America
to recognize

21:54.597 --> 21:58.221
Chinese sovereignty
over the Diaoyu Islands

21:58.305 --> 22:00.305
and the disputed mineral rights

22:00.388 --> 22:02.055
of the surrounding seabed.

22:02.138 --> 22:03.597
Can I get an amen?

22:03.680 --> 22:05.971
- Woman: What?
- Amen.

22:06.055 --> 22:07.971
Hello, everyone.
I'm Mike McLintock,

22:08.055 --> 22:12.013
and Mc-welcome to the first
episode of "McLintock--"
I mean "talk."

22:12.096 --> 22:13.971
Today I have a BuzzFeed
exclusive.

22:14.055 --> 22:15.889
We are getting
the first national interview

22:15.971 --> 22:17.971
with Lurlene, Iowa's
dog mayor,

22:18.055 --> 22:20.847
who it turns out
is not a dog, but a human.

22:20.930 --> 22:22.764
Mayor Richard Splett,
are you there?

22:22.847 --> 22:25.138
Hi, Mike.
Big fan of the show.

22:25.221 --> 22:28.055
Mayor Splett, how does it feel
to be the hero of 7-Eleven?

22:28.138 --> 22:29.180
Oh, I'm no hero.

22:29.263 --> 22:30.680
I'm just a mayor who now,

22:30.764 --> 22:32.764
temporarily, has a Slurpee
machine in his office.

22:32.847 --> 22:34.138
- Well--
- I need my iPad.

22:34.221 --> 22:36.013
( sighs ) Mayor Splett,
did you realize

22:36.096 --> 22:37.847
what you were doing
was so courageous?

22:37.930 --> 22:40.263
- Oh, good question.
- Thank you.
It's actually Wendy's.

22:40.347 --> 22:42.930
I guess I just did what anybody
would do if they were there.

22:43.013 --> 22:44.930
Except the people who were there
and didn't do anything.

22:45.013 --> 22:46.013
You heard it here first.

22:46.096 --> 22:47.930
Stick around
for more McLintock

22:48.013 --> 22:50.430
with Mike McLin-talk.

22:50.513 --> 22:53.180
Keith: Spare a nanosecond
for First Mate Quinn?

22:53.263 --> 22:54.430
What do you want, Keith?

22:56.889 --> 22:59.180
Wow. Okay.

22:59.263 --> 23:02.805
Wo zai zehli bangmang.

23:02.889 --> 23:04.555
Uh, is that Mandarin?

23:04.639 --> 23:06.513
Yes, it was.
I happen to consult

23:06.597 --> 23:09.263
for a number of very large
clients in Asia who have

23:09.347 --> 23:11.722
a strong interest in
Sino-American relations,

23:11.805 --> 23:15.639
and they were very, very
impressed and delighted
by your sermon.

23:15.722 --> 23:17.722
( laughs ) I don't know
what you're talking about--

23:17.805 --> 23:19.680
I would say that we're
well past the point

23:19.764 --> 23:21.305
of plausible deniability
at this point.

23:21.388 --> 23:24.805
I-- you know,
I haven't committed to,
um, anything--

23:24.889 --> 23:26.680
- Well, actually--
- Hi, ma'am.

23:26.764 --> 23:28.055
- Yeah?
- Can I share the news with you?

23:28.138 --> 23:29.221
- What?
- You need to hear this.

23:29.305 --> 23:31.138
Look. Faith-based
initiative just raised

23:31.221 --> 23:33.221
twenty-five million dollars.

23:33.305 --> 23:34.805
Wow. Way to go, buddy!

23:34.889 --> 23:38.347
- All of a sudden,
out of nowhere! Anonymously.
- What? Um--

23:38.430 --> 23:40.639
Okay, I'll get out
of you hair, ma'am.

23:40.722 --> 23:41.889
Okay.

23:41.971 --> 23:43.555
It must've been
the video I made, right?

23:43.639 --> 23:45.388
Well, I can't think
of any other reason.

23:45.472 --> 23:47.138
Well, let's be honest.
God had a lot to do
with it, too.

23:47.221 --> 23:48.971
- Oh, sure! Yeah.
- ( laughs )

23:49.055 --> 23:51.305
- It's a miracle.
- Let's go spend twenty-five
million dollars

23:51.388 --> 23:52.430
on some racist robo callers.

23:52.513 --> 23:53.513
- Praise the Lord.
- Right?

23:53.597 --> 23:57.263
Jonah: Thank you.

23:57.347 --> 24:00.013
You know who else
thinks that I don't
have the intelligence

24:00.096 --> 24:02.430
or the "tentrament"
to be president?

24:02.513 --> 24:05.930
- My very own campaign staff.
- ( muttering )

24:06.013 --> 24:06.930
Jonah: That's right.

24:07.013 --> 24:08.597
They have been trying to stop me

24:08.680 --> 24:09.971
from becoming president.

24:10.055 --> 24:11.263
- ( booing )
- Jonah: Yeah, no-- yeah, boo!

24:11.347 --> 24:12.221
Let 'em have it.

24:12.305 --> 24:14.388
That is my campaign chair,

24:14.472 --> 24:15.430
Amy Brookheimer.

24:15.513 --> 24:17.971
She recently had an abortion.

24:18.055 --> 24:20.639
And that is my chief strategist,
Teddy Sykes,

24:20.722 --> 24:22.096
and he is an overgrown midget

24:22.180 --> 24:23.680
who had to be
chemically castrated.

24:23.764 --> 24:26.680
- ( gasping )
- And that guy right there,

24:26.764 --> 24:28.263
that's Eric something.

24:28.347 --> 24:30.388
- Bill Ericsson.
- That's Eric Bill Ericsson,

24:30.472 --> 24:33.096
and he thinks he's
better than everybody else
in this room.

24:33.180 --> 24:35.680
- ( booing )
- I've never seen
anything like this.

24:35.764 --> 24:39.805
He's actually running
against his own campaign.
Macau, here we come.

24:39.889 --> 24:43.472
And one more thing.
I just found out from
my stupid stepfather that--

24:43.555 --> 24:44.722
Teddy: Father-in-law!

24:44.805 --> 24:46.597
...from my stupid
stepfather-in-law

24:46.680 --> 24:49.971
that math was created
by Muslims.

24:50.055 --> 24:51.472
( shouting )

24:51.555 --> 24:55.889
Yeah. And we teach
this Islamic math
to children.

24:55.971 --> 24:59.347
Math teachers are terrorists.

24:59.430 --> 25:00.555
( gasping )

25:00.639 --> 25:02.472
- I love this.
- Okay. That, that's it.

25:02.555 --> 25:04.263
I may be a registered
sex offender,

25:04.347 --> 25:06.347
but I cannot be
a part of this.
I'm, I'm gone.

25:06.430 --> 25:09.263
Algebra?
More like Al Jazeera.

25:09.347 --> 25:13.764
Under a Ryan presidency,
I will ban this Sharia math

25:13.847 --> 25:16.430
from being taught
to American children.

25:16.513 --> 25:18.180
- Amy, are you coming?
- Jonah: There will be
no more math.

25:18.263 --> 25:19.597
One sec.

25:19.680 --> 25:25.013
Jonah and Crowd:
( chanting ) No more math!

25:25.096 --> 25:30.930
God fuck America.
No more math! No more math!

25:31.013 --> 25:32.805
Jonah and Crowd:
( chanting ) No more math!

25:32.889 --> 25:35.722
( grunts )

25:35.805 --> 25:39.221
No-- are you--
she's fine. She's fine.

25:40.430 --> 25:41.680
Well, I'll tell you one thing.

25:41.764 --> 25:43.138
If we lose,
it certainly won't be

25:43.221 --> 25:45.722
for lack of touching
people in a Denny's.

25:45.805 --> 25:48.680
- All right.
So, how's the turnout?
- Ben: Uh, like my prostate.

25:48.764 --> 25:50.971
- Mostly black and much
larger than we'd like.
- ( overlaps ) Oh, shit.

25:51.055 --> 25:54.513
We're seeing unprecedented
levels of African-American
voter engagement.

25:54.597 --> 25:58.180
All right. Well,
that's terrible...
but also inspiring.

25:58.263 --> 25:59.889
Welcome to
"McLintock Embedded."

25:59.971 --> 26:01.597
- Oh! We're live.
- Madam President,

26:01.680 --> 26:02.971
would you like to say
something to our viewers?

26:03.055 --> 26:05.597
Sure, um, if you
haven't voted, please--

26:05.680 --> 26:08.722
Oh, sorry. I'm getting a call.
I apologize, it's Wendy.

26:08.805 --> 26:09.722
Oh.

26:09.805 --> 26:11.639
Hey. No, now is a good time.

26:11.722 --> 26:14.055
- Mike: What's up?
- Can't buy that kind of press.

26:14.138 --> 26:15.930
- I'm sorry.
- I need to talk to you.

26:16.013 --> 26:16.971
Sparkling water, ma'am?

26:17.055 --> 26:18.263
Yes, oh, perfect.

26:19.472 --> 26:23.805
Close the door. Okay.
Ben, I sold my soul

26:23.889 --> 26:27.138
to the Chinese for a lousy
twenty-five million dollars.

26:27.221 --> 26:28.555
Ma'am, I warned you.

26:28.639 --> 26:30.013
You cannot trust the Chinese.

26:30.096 --> 26:32.055
I married enough
of them to know that.

26:32.138 --> 26:33.388
Wait, isn't your wife Korean?

26:33.472 --> 26:35.555
Maybe. Fog of war.

26:35.639 --> 26:36.680
( knocking on door )

26:36.764 --> 26:37.764
Ma'am. You wanna see this.

26:37.847 --> 26:39.263
Something's happening.

26:39.347 --> 26:41.388
Cora: ...poll watchers
are reporting that over

26:41.472 --> 26:44.347
forty-eight thousand
black voters were turned away

26:44.430 --> 26:46.847
because their middle initials
on the voter rolls

26:46.930 --> 26:49.055
did not match
their identification.

26:49.138 --> 26:50.930
- Wait, what?
- Dan: Yeah, listen to this.

26:51.013 --> 26:52.930
"Widespread power outages
across the state,

26:53.013 --> 26:54.680
and police are urging residents

26:54.764 --> 26:56.263
to stay at home
for their own safety."

26:56.347 --> 26:57.847
"The outages
seem to be occurring

26:57.930 --> 27:00.388
primarily in African
American neighborhoods."

27:00.472 --> 27:01.597
It's a total blackout.

27:01.680 --> 27:03.430
- Okay, Ben!
- Oh, ma'am, big news.

27:03.513 --> 27:04.847
- Wendy just got a call.
- What?!

27:04.930 --> 27:06.597
We're gonna adopt
another baby from China!

27:06.680 --> 27:08.597
You know, I think it's
that secret message that I--

27:08.680 --> 27:11.221
No, no! ( stuttering ) Move!

27:11.305 --> 27:12.764
( all shouting indistinctly )

27:12.847 --> 27:14.472
Man: We got three hours left.
We can turn this.

27:14.555 --> 27:15.597
Dan: ...call the Precinct
Captains right now.

27:15.680 --> 27:17.472
Man: We can turn this!

27:17.555 --> 27:21.305
I think the Chinese
just delivered.

27:21.388 --> 27:22.597
And?

27:26.263 --> 27:29.764
Thank you, South Carolina!

27:29.847 --> 27:34.180
We had an amazing
turnout on our side.

27:34.263 --> 27:36.597
( crowd cheering )

27:36.680 --> 27:38.180
Yeah!

27:38.263 --> 27:41.597
And you know how I like
to celebrate when I win?

27:41.680 --> 27:42.597
All: How?!

27:42.680 --> 27:44.971
By winning some more!

27:45.055 --> 27:46.305
- Balloons.
- ( music playing
over speakers )

27:46.388 --> 27:50.597
( all cheering )

28:01.472 --> 28:04.180
From now on, I do what I want,

28:04.263 --> 28:08.805
I take what I want,
whenever I want it. ( chuckles )

28:08.889 --> 28:10.347
"New Selina Now."

28:10.430 --> 28:12.013
Let's watch
my victory speech again.

28:12.096 --> 28:13.263
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

28:13.347 --> 28:16.971
Uh, I don't--
I don't have the remote.

28:17.055 --> 28:20.096
Oh, it's on the table
by the chair.

28:21.513 --> 28:22.930
So go get it.

28:29.263 --> 28:30.805
Good morning, ma'am.

28:30.889 --> 28:33.221
Morning. Hey, Marjorie,
look at my eyes.

28:33.305 --> 28:35.263
Tell me straight.
Do they look okay to you?

28:35.347 --> 28:36.722
They look very puffy, ma'am.

28:36.805 --> 28:38.305
- Ugh.
- Gary: Hey.

28:38.388 --> 28:40.055
Hey, good morning.
Morning, ma'am. Marjorie.

28:40.138 --> 28:41.430
- Morning.
- Gary.

28:41.513 --> 28:42.513
- Hey, Gary?
- Yeah.

28:42.597 --> 28:44.680
Do my eyes look puffy to you?

28:44.764 --> 28:46.764
I'm surprised they
let you run for president,

28:46.847 --> 28:49.263
because you look
thirty-four, tops.

28:49.347 --> 28:52.889
( chuckles ) Yeah.
Marjorie, you're out.

28:52.971 --> 28:54.930
- ( chuckles )
- And you're... back in.

28:55.013 --> 28:57.096
Okay? You just
go back to whatever
you were doing before.

28:57.180 --> 28:58.805
- Finance Chair.
- All right, well, whatever.

28:58.889 --> 29:00.805
So who's in charge of
the faith-based outreach now?

29:00.889 --> 29:02.138
- Not it.
- You are.

29:02.221 --> 29:03.555
- Oh, I am?
- Yeah, yeah. You still are.

29:03.639 --> 29:05.472
And Keith Quinn'll
help you out too, I think.

29:05.555 --> 29:08.430
Yes, there you go. So,
your name will be all over it.

29:08.513 --> 29:10.555
Like Jodie Foster
in John Hinckley's diary.

29:10.639 --> 29:11.930
Oh, my God.
I'm obsessed with her.

29:12.013 --> 29:14.555
- Let's go.
- ( chuckles )

29:14.639 --> 29:17.513
Congratulations, Gary.
The better woman won.

29:17.597 --> 29:21.847
I'll take that. Thank you.

29:21.930 --> 29:23.180
I moved some things around.

29:23.263 --> 29:26.764
Oh, ( chuckling ) did you?
Wow. It looks better.

29:26.847 --> 29:29.597
- Mm-hmm.
- The tampons are vertical,
that's brilliant--

29:29.680 --> 29:31.388
- Selina: Gary?
- Yep?

29:31.472 --> 29:32.513
Shouldn't you be pre-chewing

29:32.597 --> 29:33.764
my mother's food for her?

29:33.847 --> 29:35.597
I told her her eyes
looked puffy.

29:35.680 --> 29:38.096
( scoffs )
Thank you, chipmunk.

29:38.180 --> 29:41.430
You're welcome, Catherine.

29:41.513 --> 29:43.096
Hey-O, Dan-O!
You bustin' outta here?

29:43.180 --> 29:44.930
Yeah, yeah. Oh,
I need an itinerary.

29:45.013 --> 29:48.597
Itineraries are only
for people who work
on the campaign.

29:48.680 --> 29:50.055
And?

29:52.388 --> 29:56.430
Wait, I'm fired?
Per fucking who?!

29:56.513 --> 29:58.430
Per Selina.
I believe her words were,

29:58.513 --> 30:00.472
"If I need another
Washington douche,

30:00.555 --> 30:02.263
I'll go to
the M Street Rite Aid."

30:02.347 --> 30:04.597
You should flip
through your NDA.

30:04.680 --> 30:07.847
If you breathe a word
of anything, to anyone,

30:07.930 --> 30:10.472
we'll slit your throat.

30:10.555 --> 30:11.889
Later, gator!

30:16.388 --> 30:18.805
Greg Hart:
Congressman Ryan placed
a distant third last night.

30:18.889 --> 30:20.138
Where does the campaign
go from here?

30:20.221 --> 30:23.305
Third place was
a massive win for us.

30:23.388 --> 30:26.138
Selina Meyer and Kemi Talbot
can feel Jonah Ryan

30:26.221 --> 30:27.347
breathing down their necks.

30:27.430 --> 30:28.971
Jonah Ryan
said he's been lying

30:29.055 --> 30:30.305
to everyone the whole time.

30:30.388 --> 30:31.680
Why should anyone
trust him now?

30:31.764 --> 30:34.263
Frankly, Jonah Ryan
is the only candidate

30:34.347 --> 30:36.639
who's honest
about his dishonesty.

30:36.722 --> 30:40.971
And that is why Jonah Ryan
is the next President
of the United States.

30:41.055 --> 30:43.597
Speaking as someone
who's covered politics
for twenty years,

30:43.680 --> 30:45.764
- Jonah Ryan terrifies me.
- That's your opinion.

30:45.847 --> 30:47.847
I find his mindless,
toxic fear-mongering

30:47.930 --> 30:50.930
a dangerous addition
to our already divisive
political climate.

30:51.013 --> 30:52.180
Again, your opinion.

30:52.263 --> 30:53.889
Tomorrow morning,
we will be live

30:53.971 --> 30:56.388
with exclusive coverage
of Congressman Ryan's rally

30:56.472 --> 30:59.305
in Youngstown, Ohio,
only on CNN.

31:03.930 --> 31:06.180
Tell my attorney to meet me in
the next filler state we're in

31:06.263 --> 31:06.930
'cause last I heard,

31:07.305 --> 31:08.513
you can't run for office
and be in prison.

31:08.597 --> 31:09.597
BEN CAFFERTY: Well, maybe
in the House you can't.

31:09.930 --> 31:11.597
MAN:
Our government has assigned you

31:11.680 --> 31:13.847
your very own
Secret Service detail.

31:13.930 --> 31:15.430
Congressman Ryan,
it's an honor.

31:15.513 --> 31:17.805
Oh, yeah! This is like
looking in a mirror!

31:17.889 --> 31:18.805
Yeah, a hot mirror.

31:19.096 --> 31:22.221
I have always been transparent
about how old I am.

31:22.305 --> 31:24.347
-Yeah, 55.
-I believe it's 53.

31:24.430 --> 31:26.180
-Late 40s.
-You're all correct.

31:26.263 --> 31:27.096
Last night...

31:27.430 --> 31:29.180
I don't like when people
get closer to talk to me.

31:29.263 --> 31:30.680
It usually means
they're gonna be facing

31:30.764 --> 31:31.930
a longer prison sentence.

31:32.013 --> 31:34.305
-...I saw Andrew.
-The prosecution rests.
