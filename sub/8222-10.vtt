WEBVTT

00:00.981 --> 00:03.040
Do not try
any of the experiments

00:03.116 --> 00:05.550
you are about to see at home.

00:05.619 --> 00:08.349
You heard him.
Don't do it.

00:10.324 --> 00:12.884
NARRATOR: On this episode
of "Mythbusters"...

00:12.959 --> 00:13.926
WALBORN:
Ready, hit it.

00:13.994 --> 00:16.224
NARRATOR:
...gear up your ears...

00:17.964 --> 00:19.488
That kind of wakes you up
in the morning.

00:19.566 --> 00:21.659
NARRATOR: And button up
your bulletproof vest...

00:21.735 --> 00:23.430
Protecting for two, you see.

00:23.503 --> 00:25.733
NARRATOR:
...because there's guns galore

00:25.806 --> 00:28.502
and big audio dynamite.

00:29.109 --> 00:33.910
First, Adam and Jamie ask,
"Can a sonic boom break glass?"

00:35.816 --> 00:37.408
I call that a bull's-eye.

00:37.484 --> 00:41.045
NARRATOR: Then, Kari, Grant,
and Tory fire up a film fable

00:41.121 --> 00:44.284
to find out
if you can bend bullets.

00:44.358 --> 00:46.121
So duck and cover,

00:46.193 --> 00:50.425
because this is going to be
fast, loud, and lethal.

00:50.497 --> 00:52.124
WALBORN: Come on.
Stick with me, Adam. You got it.

00:52.199 --> 00:54.167
You got it.
Come on. Stay with us.

00:57.738 --> 01:00.639
NARRATOR:
Who are the Mythbusters?

01:00.707 --> 01:02.038
Adam Savage...

01:02.109 --> 01:03.508
I'm ready to go, man!

01:03.577 --> 01:05.203
NARRATOR:
...and Jamie Hyneman.

01:05.278 --> 01:06.973
It's like a wet T-shirt contest.

01:07.047 --> 01:08.514
NARRATOR:
Between them, more than 30 years

01:08.582 --> 01:11.676
of special-effects experience.

01:11.752 --> 01:12.844
Wow!

01:12.919 --> 01:15.581
NARRATOR:
Joining them... Kari Byron...

01:15.655 --> 01:17.179
Pbht!

01:17.257 --> 01:19.521
- NARRATOR: Grant lmahara...
- [Sobbing] Why?!

01:19.593 --> 01:21.288
...and Tory Belleci.

01:21.361 --> 01:22.350
Let's go!

01:22.429 --> 01:24.329
NARRATOR:
They don't just tell the myths.

01:24.398 --> 01:26.992
They put them to the test.

01:28.000 --> 01:34.074

01:38.879 --> 01:40.813
All right, I hear
this one's a loud one.

01:40.881 --> 01:42.849
- What's the story?
- Sonic boom.

01:42.916 --> 01:44.850
- What's that?
- Sonic boom!

01:44.918 --> 01:46.476
What about a sonic boom?!

01:46.553 --> 01:48.714
Sonic boom breaks glass!

01:48.789 --> 01:50.814
Well, sure, a sonic boom
can break glass.

01:50.891 --> 01:54.759
The fans are saying that any
sonic boom breaks any glass...

01:54.828 --> 01:57.422
windows, glasses, you name it.

01:57.497 --> 01:59.624
[Laughs]
That sounds like fun.

01:59.699 --> 02:02.634
Well, the best part is
that we get to ride in a jet.

02:02.702 --> 02:04.636
You want to lay down a bet?

02:05.839 --> 02:08.103
Where are you going?
Dude!

02:10.377 --> 02:15.371
When something this noisy goes
faster than the speed of sound,

02:15.449 --> 02:17.314
the sonic boom created

02:17.384 --> 02:19.909
is a powerful
and visceral experience.

02:20.787 --> 02:22.186
The question is,

02:22.255 --> 02:25.554
can any old sonic boom
really break glass,

02:25.625 --> 02:28.093
and for answers,
the guys are going to fly

02:28.161 --> 02:31.688
with the world-famous
Blue Angels.

02:31.765 --> 02:33.858
Dude, come on back.
I was just kidding.

02:33.934 --> 02:35.561
I want to hear
all about these jets.

02:35.635 --> 02:37.398
It's not just about the jets.

02:37.471 --> 02:39.996
The myth is that any sonic boom
can break glass,

02:40.073 --> 02:42.234
and you and I both know
that bullets

02:42.309 --> 02:43.606
go supersonic sometimes.

02:43.677 --> 02:46.373
You're suggesting we start
with guns and glass.

02:46.446 --> 02:47.413
Exactly.

02:47.481 --> 02:49.312
I love it!
And then we go for the jets.

02:49.382 --> 02:51.407
Please, can I be the one
that flies in the jet?

02:51.485 --> 02:53.385
Why should you get to fly
in the jet?

02:53.453 --> 02:56.183
'Cause I'm gonna be funnier
on camera in the jet.

02:56.256 --> 02:59.487
Well, okay, but you need to log
some training hours first,

02:59.559 --> 03:01.186
because we need to know
that you can handle it

03:01.261 --> 03:02.558
before you go supersonic.

03:02.629 --> 03:04.688
Oh, this is so cool!

03:07.667 --> 03:09.134
NARRATOR:
But before the guys

03:09.202 --> 03:11.636
bring out the big guns
to test the bullets,

03:11.705 --> 03:13.900
it's off
to the Naval Air Facility

03:13.974 --> 03:15.965
at El Centro, California,

03:16.042 --> 03:19.170
the winter home
of the Blue Angels.

03:20.547 --> 03:22.378
They've kindly allowed Adam

03:22.449 --> 03:25.646
to join one of their
subsonic training sessions,

03:25.719 --> 03:29.314
so that he can qualify
for the supersonic test flights

03:29.389 --> 03:30.583
later on.

03:30.657 --> 03:33.990
Adam is gonna be going up
in a Boeing F/A-18 Hornet.

03:35.562 --> 03:37.792
The "F/A" stands
for "Fighter Attack."

03:39.266 --> 03:40.255
And their twin engines

03:40.333 --> 03:44.429
put out a total
of 32,000 pounds of thrust...

03:48.708 --> 03:52.166
...which propels them at up
to about 1,400 miles per hour...

03:52.746 --> 03:55.613
...or just under
twice the speed of sound.

03:57.017 --> 04:00.145
NARRATOR: But first,
Adam is getting a brief briefing

04:00.220 --> 04:03.246
and a crash course
in combating G-forces.

04:03.323 --> 04:05.154
SWANSON: A negative "G"
is like a roller coaster.

04:05.225 --> 04:07.591
Lightheadedness. The stomach
feels like it's coming up.

04:08.695 --> 04:10.026
[Laughing] Holy crap!

04:10.096 --> 04:11.586
SWANSON: To combat that,
all we're gonna do

04:11.665 --> 04:14.327
is take long, deep breaths,
and that helps with the nausea.

04:14.401 --> 04:15.834
[Gagging]

04:15.902 --> 04:17.596
Positive G's are the ones
that make it feel

04:17.671 --> 04:19.730
like there's an elephant
sitting on your chest.

04:19.805 --> 04:21.103
Hick! Hick!

04:21.173 --> 04:22.334
When he's in the maneuver,

04:22.409 --> 04:24.377
it's gonna force all the blood
from your upper body

04:24.444 --> 04:26.605
down into your toes,
and you want to combat that.

04:26.680 --> 04:29.706
The way that we do that
is the anti-G strain maneuver,

04:29.783 --> 04:31.614
and it's gonna look
something like this.

04:31.685 --> 04:33.846
Hick-ahh!

04:33.920 --> 04:35.683
Hick-ahh!

04:35.755 --> 04:36.915
Hick-ahh!

04:36.990 --> 04:38.582
SWANSON: If you start
seeing yourself go into G-lock,

04:38.658 --> 04:40.216
you'll start to see
this gray tunnel.

04:40.293 --> 04:43.023
And it's gonna look like
it'll start closing in on you,

04:43.096 --> 04:44.085
closing in on you.

04:44.164 --> 04:45.495
Hick!

04:45.565 --> 04:47.760
If you don't fight it,
it'll go from gray to black,

04:47.834 --> 04:48.994
and you'll pass out.

04:49.069 --> 04:51.799
NARRATOR: Undeterred
by that possibility...

04:51.871 --> 04:53.270
Let's go fly.

04:53.340 --> 04:56.070
NARRATOR: Our excited
little jet-fighter rookie...

04:56.142 --> 04:58.235
Right here, these are
the yellow and black handle.

04:58.311 --> 05:00.836
That's the ejection handle.
Hands off at all times.

05:01.848 --> 05:03.782
NARRATOR:
...gets all set and seated,

05:03.850 --> 05:06.250
ready for his training ride.

05:06.319 --> 05:08.150
WALBORN: Let me just call up
Tower here

05:08.221 --> 05:09.347
and see if we can go take off.

05:09.422 --> 05:10.616
Okay.

05:10.690 --> 05:13.090
NARRATOR:
Adam, in Blue Angel Number 7,

05:13.159 --> 05:15.627
is ready for the experience
of a lifetime.

05:15.695 --> 05:17.720
WALBORN:
Here comes middle power.

05:17.797 --> 05:18.889
It's about 20 knots.

05:18.965 --> 05:20.455
There they go.

05:20.533 --> 05:22.330
NARRATOR:
And they call this a job.

05:24.437 --> 05:27.600
- WALBORN: There's 80 knots. 100.
- [Chuckles]

05:28.675 --> 05:30.609
There we go.
It's 240.

05:32.078 --> 05:32.840
230.

05:34.681 --> 05:36.080
280.
Ready to fly?

05:36.149 --> 05:37.582
- I am.
- Ready, hit it.

05:43.657 --> 05:45.090
Oh-ho!

05:45.158 --> 05:46.216
WALBORN:
And we're flying.

05:46.292 --> 05:47.782
[Laughing] Holy crap!

05:48.862 --> 05:51.194
At one point, they were going
along the runway,

05:51.264 --> 05:54.700
and then all of a sudden,
they were going straight up.

05:54.768 --> 05:56.497
WALBORN:
Going up through 2,000 feet.

05:56.569 --> 05:57.866
Wow.

05:57.937 --> 06:00.269
ADAM: We've had 6 years
of doing incredible,

06:00.340 --> 06:03.173
life-changing kind of crazy crap
on this show,

06:03.243 --> 06:04.676
and that takes the cake.

06:04.744 --> 06:06.974
That's the best thing
I've ever done.

06:07.047 --> 06:09.015
WALBORN: Just a way
to see the world upside down

06:09.082 --> 06:10.208
as we cruise on out.

06:10.283 --> 06:13.343
Wow.
Oh, that's intense.

06:13.420 --> 06:14.387
It is absolutely like

06:14.454 --> 06:16.115
every special-effects film
you've ever seen.

06:16.189 --> 06:17.315
It's that cool.

06:17.390 --> 06:19.585
Wow, this is beautiful.

06:19.659 --> 06:21.490
[Laughs]

06:31.471 --> 06:33.132
[Making whooshing sounds]

06:33.206 --> 06:34.696
Okay, so, what's with
the hardware?

06:34.774 --> 06:35.832
We have a new movie myth

06:35.909 --> 06:37.843
that has "Mythbusters"
written all over it.

06:37.911 --> 06:39.401
And since this movie
has come out,

06:39.479 --> 06:41.504
we have been inundated
with requests to do it.

06:41.581 --> 06:44.516
In fact, it is the most
requested myth of the year.

06:44.584 --> 06:46.176
You're talking about
the movie "Wanted," right?

06:46.252 --> 06:47.150
Exactly.

06:47.220 --> 06:49.950
And in that movie,
a secret society of assassins

06:50.023 --> 06:52.014
shares the ability
to curve a bullet.

06:52.092 --> 06:54.754
Just with a little bit
of a flick of the gun,

06:54.828 --> 06:57.991
you can curve the bullet around
an obstacle and hit your target.

06:58.064 --> 06:59.463
[Lmitates bullet ricocheting]

06:59.532 --> 07:00.624
This should be fun.

07:00.700 --> 07:02.691
Or really dangerous.
[Makes whooshing sound]

07:02.769 --> 07:04.236
Do I get a play gun, too?

07:04.304 --> 07:06.169
When we're done.
[Makes whooshing sound]

07:07.440 --> 07:10.705
NARRATOR: When your target
is hidden behind a side of pork

07:10.777 --> 07:14.736
and Angelina Jolie,
what's a secret assassin to do?

07:15.315 --> 07:16.543
Shoot the target.

07:17.117 --> 07:20.348
NARRATOR: Well, supposedly,
with a swing of the arm

07:20.420 --> 07:21.978
and a flick of the wrist,

07:22.055 --> 07:24.717
in obligatory
action-movie slow motion,

07:24.791 --> 07:29.785
the bullet curves around
the obstacle, saving your bacon.

07:31.030 --> 07:32.691
Okay, so, how do you
want to test this?

07:32.766 --> 07:34.791
I say we just go for it.
Pshh!

07:34.868 --> 07:35.926
GRANT: Exactly.

07:36.002 --> 07:38.470
In the movie, James McAvoy
was able to curve a bullet

07:38.538 --> 07:41.166
after only a few tries
with minimal training,

07:41.241 --> 07:43.300
which makes us
perfectly qualified.

07:43.376 --> 07:46.345
Okay, but let's say
on the off chance

07:46.412 --> 07:48.744
that none of us
are fifth-generation

07:48.815 --> 07:52.080
secret superhuman assassins,
maybe we could break it down,

07:52.152 --> 07:53.983
look at the rifling,
aerodynamics,

07:54.053 --> 07:56.044
and, I don't know, throw in
a robot for good measure.

07:56.122 --> 07:57.282
Okay, you got a point there.

07:57.357 --> 07:59.587
What's wrong? You guys feeling
ballistically challenged?

07:59.659 --> 08:01.957
I say we just let our
cold-blooded assassin instincts

08:02.028 --> 08:03.290
take over!

08:03.863 --> 08:06.525
Okay. How about
you hand me the gun

08:06.599 --> 08:08.499
and then we'll go
with that plan?

08:08.568 --> 08:10.229
How about you get your own gun?

08:10.303 --> 08:12.134
- Just give me the gun.
- Nope.

08:12.205 --> 08:13.729
All right.

08:13.807 --> 08:16.401
NARRATOR: And the location
for our gun-toting trio

08:16.476 --> 08:18.910
to potentially bend
their bullets

08:18.978 --> 08:22.505
is deep in the heart of...
wine country?

08:22.582 --> 08:23.844
[Pig squeals]

08:23.917 --> 08:26.112
Napa Valley,
Northern California.

08:26.186 --> 08:28.654
GRANT: So, to start out
testing our curving-bullet myth,

08:28.721 --> 08:30.586
we're actually
gonna try it ourselves.

08:30.657 --> 08:34.558
But because this involves
swinging a live gun around...

08:34.626 --> 08:36.094
[Cow moos]

08:36.162 --> 08:38.653
...we need a lot of open space.

08:38.731 --> 08:41.666
KARI: Okay. So, for our first
test, we just need a control...

08:41.734 --> 08:43.929
well, target practice to make
sure we can all hit the target.

08:44.003 --> 08:45.493
Yeah, 'cause there's no point
curving a bullet

08:45.572 --> 08:47.699
- if we can't hit our target.
- Yeah. Sounds good.

08:47.774 --> 08:50.504
KARI: And it looks like I'm
the first target.

08:50.577 --> 08:52.135
[Growls]

08:52.212 --> 08:55.306
NARRATOR: So our trio
of would-be assassins

08:55.381 --> 08:58.748
select their weapons,
line up, and let loose.

08:58.818 --> 08:59.842
Let her have it, Kari.

08:59.919 --> 09:00.817
[Gunshot]

09:08.561 --> 09:11.189
Look at that.
Four in the black!

09:12.932 --> 09:14.331
[Gunshots]

09:17.170 --> 09:19.536
Love that smell.

09:19.606 --> 09:20.971
TORY: It looks like
we're all hitting the target.

09:21.040 --> 09:23.531
You guys ready
to start curving bullets?

09:23.610 --> 09:25.134
- KARI: Sure!
- Let's do it.

09:25.211 --> 09:27.406
NARRATOR:
And first up is Grant...

09:27.480 --> 09:28.708
[Grunts]

09:28.781 --> 09:31.716
NARRATOR: Who volunteered
to put in a few extra hours

09:31.784 --> 09:34.514
studying
Angelina Jolie's technique.

09:34.587 --> 09:36.919
I think you must have been
practicing in the mirror.

09:36.990 --> 09:38.617
You've got some moves.

09:38.691 --> 09:40.921
It's kind of like
an aerobics workout.

09:40.994 --> 09:42.120
[Heart beating]

09:42.195 --> 09:45.824
[Breathing deeply]

09:45.899 --> 09:47.560
[Gunshot]

09:47.634 --> 09:49.363
Ahh! Ha ha!

09:49.435 --> 09:51.027
[Gunshots]

09:51.104 --> 09:54.733
James McAvoy didn't get it
on his first one.

09:55.608 --> 09:57.872
NARRATOR:
But neither Grant lmahara...

09:57.944 --> 09:59.411
Ahh!

09:59.479 --> 10:01.447
...nor Tory Belleci...

10:01.514 --> 10:02.981
[Gunshots]

10:03.049 --> 10:04.676
...got it at all.

10:04.751 --> 10:07.879
GRANT: It's really interesting.
It happens very fast.

10:07.954 --> 10:09.421
The characters in the movie

10:09.489 --> 10:11.548
have this ability
to speed up their heartbeat,

10:11.624 --> 10:14.149
and that makes
everything else slow down.

10:14.227 --> 10:16.058
Apparently,
I don't have that ability.

10:16.129 --> 10:19.292
It just goes, "Pa-poom!"
And then it's gone.

10:19.866 --> 10:22.994
NARRATOR:
Next up is Kari and co.

10:23.069 --> 10:24.934
As I am six months pregnant,

10:25.004 --> 10:27.529
I will be wearing
a bulletproof vest.

10:27.607 --> 10:29.199
Protecting for two, you see.

10:34.681 --> 10:38.777
As I suspected, I don't have
superhuman strength,

10:38.851 --> 10:41.513
abilities,
or shooting capabilities.

10:41.587 --> 10:44.078
What are you gonna do?
I'm just a regular girl.

10:44.657 --> 10:47.421
NARRATOR: With none
of our gung-ho gunslingers

10:47.493 --> 10:50.985
coming close to the target,
never mind curving a bullet,

10:51.064 --> 10:53.931
it's quite clear
that imitating the movie

10:54.000 --> 10:55.934
just isn't going to cut it.

10:58.037 --> 10:59.095
- WALBORN: Ready to go flying?
- I am.

10:59.172 --> 11:01.299
Ready, hit it.

11:04.110 --> 11:07.079
NARRATOR: To find out
if the energy from a sonic boom

11:07.146 --> 11:08.511
can break glass...

11:08.581 --> 11:10.048
[Laughing] Holy crap!

11:10.116 --> 11:13.017
NARRATOR: Adam and Jamie have
recruited the Blue Angels...

11:13.086 --> 11:15.554
WALBORN: Take a deep breath.
Ready, hit it.

11:15.621 --> 11:18.988
NARRATOR: The U.S. Navy's
flight demonstration squadron,

11:19.058 --> 11:21.322
specifically
pilot Lieutenant Ben Walborn...

11:21.394 --> 11:24.363
WALBORN: Going on up to 5 G's.
We got 5 G's. 51/2.

11:24.430 --> 11:26.728
NARRATOR: Is taking Adam
for a training flight

11:26.799 --> 11:29.267
in preparation
for supersonic testing.

11:29.335 --> 11:30.996
ADAM: Wow, I saw a little
of the gray tunnel there.

11:31.070 --> 11:32.435
WALBORN: Yeah.

11:32.505 --> 11:34.063
Depending on
what the jet's doing,

11:34.140 --> 11:35.539
Adam is either
gonna be weightless

11:35.608 --> 11:38.668
or he's gonna be experiencing
about 71/2 G's...

11:38.745 --> 11:39.609
Hick!

11:39.679 --> 11:43.945
...which means that he'll feel
like he weighs 1,400 pounds.

11:44.017 --> 11:44.813
Hick!

11:44.884 --> 11:47.375
Kind of like having
an elephant on his chest.

11:47.453 --> 11:50.684
Now, if he follows
his anti-blackout techniques

11:50.757 --> 11:53.225
that he was taught about
in our safety briefing,

11:53.292 --> 11:54.589
he shouldn't pass out.

11:54.660 --> 11:55.388
Hick!

11:55.461 --> 11:57.088
WALBORN: Come on.
Stick with me, Adam. You got it.

11:57.163 --> 11:58.357
You got it. Come on.

11:58.431 --> 12:00.399
Stay with us.
Stay with us.

12:00.466 --> 12:02.366
We got it.
Come back.

12:04.670 --> 12:06.137
- You with me?
- I'm with you.

12:06.205 --> 12:08.571
I passed out there
for just a second.

12:08.641 --> 12:12.577
But given his past history,
I think he's gonna spew.

12:12.645 --> 12:14.476
ADAM: I'm starting to feel
a little nauseous.

12:14.547 --> 12:15.946
I think I may throw up.

12:16.015 --> 12:18.006
- WALBORN: You got the bags?
- I do. Hold on.

12:20.186 --> 12:21.210
[Coughs]

12:21.287 --> 12:22.311
NARRATOR: Incredibly,

12:22.388 --> 12:25.152
despite blowing chunks
on several occasions,

12:25.224 --> 12:28.057
the experience
still blew Adam's mind.

12:29.028 --> 12:30.290
ADAM:
There were two

12:30.363 --> 12:31.853
kind of mind-blowing things
about that experience.

12:31.931 --> 12:34.092
One is that while I am using

12:34.167 --> 12:35.896
every ounce of strength
and energy I have

12:35.968 --> 12:38.664
just to keep from passing out,

12:38.738 --> 12:40.069
Lieutenant Walborn
is going through

12:40.139 --> 12:41.401
everything
that I'm going through,

12:41.474 --> 12:43.601
except that he's piloting
a $50 million plane,

12:43.676 --> 12:48.773
going through these motions,
and talking to me all the time.

12:48.848 --> 12:51.817
The second one is that,
even though I passed out,

12:51.884 --> 12:55.047
even though I threw up,
even though my dignity,

12:55.121 --> 12:57.555
or lack thereof,
is on display for television,

12:57.623 --> 13:00.319
it didn't detract
from the experience at all.

13:01.994 --> 13:03.655
Two.

13:05.031 --> 13:07.397
We have fired a whole crapload
of rockets on the show,

13:07.467 --> 13:09.526
but we've never ridden in one.

13:09.602 --> 13:10.569
[Chuckles]

13:10.636 --> 13:12.126
WALBORN:
Ready, hit it.

13:14.240 --> 13:15.434
Oh-ho!

13:15.508 --> 13:16.770
WALBORN:
And we're flying.

13:16.843 --> 13:18.606
[Laughing] Holy crap.

13:18.678 --> 13:19.975
That thing is fast.

13:20.046 --> 13:21.946
It is pretty fast.
We did that vertical takeoff.

13:22.014 --> 13:24.812
We were going about 30,000 feet
per minute climb rate up there.

13:24.884 --> 13:26.283
Did you break
the speed of sound?

13:26.352 --> 13:28.183
- No, I did not.
- But you can, right?

13:28.254 --> 13:29.744
You guys break the sound barrier
all the time.

13:29.822 --> 13:31.687
Yes, but never at an air show.

13:31.757 --> 13:34.817
The F.A.A. Prohibits flying
supersonic over populated areas.

13:34.894 --> 13:36.020
In order to fly supersonic,
we'll go out

13:36.095 --> 13:38.996
to restricted zones, or at least
30 miles off the shore.

13:39.065 --> 13:41.499
JAMIE: Are you ready to barf
at the speed of sound?

13:41.567 --> 13:43.501
All right.
Where do we stand?

13:43.569 --> 13:47.130
Well, you blew chunks.
You passed out a bunch of times.

13:47.206 --> 13:48.503
You're cleared to fly.

13:48.574 --> 13:51.202
[Laughs]
So I get to fly supersonic now?

13:51.277 --> 13:52.744
Well, hold on a second,
there, cowboy.

13:52.812 --> 13:54.279
Remember, we were gonna start

13:54.347 --> 13:56.372
with sonic booms
from guns first.

13:56.449 --> 13:57.438
Oh, right!

13:57.517 --> 13:59.041
I've got a tableful
of glassware.

13:59.118 --> 14:01.109
I've got a .50-caliber rifle.

14:01.187 --> 14:02.154
We're good to go.

14:02.221 --> 14:04.917
That sounds like a perfect day.
Let's do it.

14:04.991 --> 14:06.515
NARRATOR:
So, while Adam gets busy

14:06.592 --> 14:09.026
with the corridor
of glassware...

14:09.095 --> 14:10.289
[Chuckles]

14:10.363 --> 14:12.763
NARRATOR: Hyneman
is handling the hardware.

14:12.832 --> 14:16.199
JAMIE: If you're not aware,
the .50-caliber is the big gun.

14:16.269 --> 14:19.204
There's not really anything
that a civilian can get ahold of

14:19.272 --> 14:21.763
that's any bigger
or more powerful than this.

14:21.841 --> 14:24.071
It kind of puts
a smile on your face

14:24.143 --> 14:26.168
if you're a gun enthusiast.

14:26.245 --> 14:29.612
NARRATOR: And the peaceful
pastoral location

14:29.682 --> 14:33.209
that's about to be interrupted
by the sound of violence

14:33.286 --> 14:36.153
is a familiar scene
to the Mythbusters team.

14:36.222 --> 14:39.680
ADAM: This bucolic setting is,
in fact, the Chabot Gun Range

14:39.759 --> 14:41.659
and we've shot many
bullet-related myths here,

14:41.727 --> 14:43.661
including "Sniper Scope"

14:43.729 --> 14:47.688
and a couple of
"What is Bulletproof?" episodes.

14:47.767 --> 14:53.296
Today we want to find out if one
of these can break one of these.

14:53.372 --> 14:57.274
But not by hitting it,
merely by passing by.

14:57.343 --> 15:00.176
Yes, today is all about
the sonic boom.

15:00.246 --> 15:01.474
JAMIE:
Let's talk sonic booms.

15:01.547 --> 15:02.844
The first thing you need to know

15:02.915 --> 15:06.715
is that sound travels at
761 miles per hour at sea level.

15:06.786 --> 15:09.653
Now, this bullet goes supersonic
when it's fired,

15:09.722 --> 15:12.850
and it goes
about 1,984 miles per hour.

15:12.925 --> 15:15.553
And what is happening is that
there's a shock wave created

15:15.628 --> 15:18.188
by kind of a conical
wall of sound

15:18.264 --> 15:20.824
trailing behind the bullet
as it's going through the air,

15:20.900 --> 15:25.064
and when that wall of sound
actually crosses a person,

15:25.137 --> 15:28.197
the person experiences that
as a sonic boom.

15:28.274 --> 15:31.004
You can think of this kind of
like a boat on the water,

15:31.077 --> 15:33.637
and the boat
is leaving a wake behind it,

15:33.713 --> 15:36.614
and you're like a dinghy
kind of floating nearby,

15:36.682 --> 15:41.176
and when the wake passes across
you, you start to react to it.

15:41.254 --> 15:42.312
[Vomits]

15:42.388 --> 15:46.552
Now, what we're doing here
is seeing what glass will do

15:46.626 --> 15:49.254
when that pressure wave
goes through the glass.

15:49.328 --> 15:51.455
Will it break it?
We're gonna find out.

15:53.266 --> 15:55.063
NARRATOR:
It's a filmic fable

15:55.134 --> 15:59.264
that has the Mythbuster
message boards in a spin.

15:59.338 --> 16:02.899
Can you really bend it
like Brangelina?

16:05.211 --> 16:09.341
Well, so far, despite
the team's best efforts...

16:10.416 --> 16:13.249
...there's been no sign
of a bullet-bending shot.

16:13.319 --> 16:15.719
TORY: That's looking
pretty straight to me.

16:15.788 --> 16:17.449
It doesn't look like
it's curving at all.

16:17.523 --> 16:18.581
Swing and a miss.

16:19.692 --> 16:21.284
NARRATOR: Fact is,
most of their shots

16:21.360 --> 16:24.158
went nowhere near the target.

16:24.230 --> 16:26.721
A little early on the draw.

16:27.967 --> 16:29.958
NARRATOR:
So to test this properly,

16:30.036 --> 16:33.733
they need to match the movie
characters' superhuman speed,

16:33.806 --> 16:36.001
strength, and accuracy.

16:37.176 --> 16:39.508
So, needless to say,
we failed miserably

16:39.578 --> 16:41.205
at trying
to curve the bullet ourselves.

16:41.280 --> 16:43.214
But you know what?
We're only human.

16:43.282 --> 16:46.615
And the characters in "Wanted"
have superhuman abilities.

16:46.686 --> 16:49.154
So that's why
we're resurrecting this.

16:49.221 --> 16:50.688
It's a sword-swinging robot...

16:50.756 --> 16:51.882
Oh!

16:51.957 --> 16:53.515
GRANT: Became
a bat-swinging robot...

16:54.260 --> 16:55.386
That's the hit!

16:55.461 --> 16:57.759
GRANT: And became
a hat-swinging robot...

16:58.798 --> 17:01.596
...and it's about to become
a bullet-curving robot.

17:01.667 --> 17:04.227
It can swing its arm
at superhuman speeds,

17:04.303 --> 17:06.271
and what's more,
it can fire the gun

17:06.339 --> 17:08.603
at precisely the moment
we want it to.

17:08.674 --> 17:11.472
Take off some of the rust,
change it around,

17:11.544 --> 17:13.603
and we're good to go.

17:13.679 --> 17:14.839
KARI:
Going down.

17:14.914 --> 17:16.973
We need a completely
controlled environment

17:17.049 --> 17:19.381
to test our crazy gunslinging
rig, so we've come down

17:19.452 --> 17:21.317
to the South San Francisco
Police Department.

17:21.387 --> 17:23.912
They have a firing range,
and they're gonna let us use it.

17:24.490 --> 17:27.050
NARRATOR: And while Grant
gets ready for action,

17:27.126 --> 17:30.391
Tory and Kari prepare to get
the results down on paper.

17:31.430 --> 17:33.921
We need to find out whether or
not these bullets are curving,

17:33.999 --> 17:35.796
but in order to do that,
we need to be able

17:35.868 --> 17:37.631
to track the path
of our bullets.

17:37.703 --> 17:39.796
So, we've set up
five frames of paper

17:39.872 --> 17:41.635
down the gun range,
8 feet apart.

17:41.707 --> 17:44.073
That way, when the gun goes off,
the bullet will punch a hole

17:44.143 --> 17:45.906
in each one
of those sheets of paper.

17:45.978 --> 17:48.310
Science is a party.
Unh! Unh! Unh!

17:48.381 --> 17:50.542
Now, if the bullets
are flying straight,

17:50.616 --> 17:51.776
those holes should all line up,

17:51.851 --> 17:53.011
and we should be able
to see that

17:53.085 --> 17:55.349
by pointing a laser pointer
down the hole.

17:55.421 --> 17:57.184
Hey, it works!

17:57.256 --> 17:59.486
Now, if those holes
are not lining up,

17:59.558 --> 18:01.082
then we're curving bullets.

18:02.061 --> 18:04.996
GRANT: So, the first test up
is at regular human speed.

18:05.064 --> 18:06.759
I know we've already
done this test ourselves,

18:06.832 --> 18:08.891
which qualifies as human speed.

18:08.968 --> 18:12.267
But the robot is capable
of perfect execution,

18:12.338 --> 18:14.602
and that's what we need to do
is take out any differences

18:14.673 --> 18:18.109
in our timing or our aim
and do it perfectly.

18:18.177 --> 18:20.941
Normally here on "Mythbusters,"
we're pretty safety-conscious,

18:21.013 --> 18:22.480
but on this experiment
in particular,

18:22.548 --> 18:25.711
because we've got a gun going
a full 360 degrees around,

18:25.785 --> 18:27.810
we have an extra set
of precautions.

18:27.887 --> 18:28.911
GRANT:
Exhaust valves...

18:28.988 --> 18:31.548
- open, open, open.
- Check.

18:31.624 --> 18:34.593
And because Tory and I are gonna
be in the danger zone here,

18:34.660 --> 18:37.151
we're wearing full
bulletproof riot gear.

18:37.229 --> 18:40.460
Turn elbow to home.
Pin is in.

18:40.533 --> 18:42.501
Trigger cylinder is out.

18:42.568 --> 18:44.035
Are we ready to load the gun?

18:44.103 --> 18:46.128
- Almost.
- Check.

18:46.205 --> 18:47.638
10 more steps.

18:47.706 --> 18:48.673
Damn!

18:48.741 --> 18:51.209
Secondly, I've got
a 25-point checklist

18:51.277 --> 18:54.508
to make sure that we can load
and discharge the weapon safely.

18:54.580 --> 18:55.945
- Okay.
- Your fly's down.

18:56.015 --> 18:57.277
Check.

18:57.349 --> 18:58.577
That ought to cover it.

18:58.651 --> 19:00.642
Here we go.
We are loading the gun.

19:01.654 --> 19:03.679
All right,
we are loaded and hot.

19:03.756 --> 19:05.621
Okay, pull the elbow pin.

19:06.192 --> 19:09.491
- TORY: Pin pulled.
- Pressurizing the shoulder.

19:11.997 --> 19:13.259
This reminds me of Nam.

19:14.099 --> 19:15.157
- Ready?
- Ready!

19:15.234 --> 19:16.792
Safety pin pulled.
Let's go.

19:16.869 --> 19:18.268
GRANT:
Get out of here!

19:18.337 --> 19:20.897
KARI: Okay, this is
going to be human speed.

19:20.973 --> 19:22.031
GRANT:
Here we go.

19:22.107 --> 19:24.701
- 3, 2, 1.
- [Click]

19:24.777 --> 19:26.039
[Gunshot]

19:29.748 --> 19:31.409
KARI:
I can see two and three.

19:31.484 --> 19:34.009
NARRATOR: Remember,
if the bullet did curve...

19:34.086 --> 19:36.646
We got all five frames.
That was a good test.

19:36.722 --> 19:39.020
NARRATOR: The holes
in the five sheets of paper,

19:39.091 --> 19:41.855
the physical evidence
of the bullet's trajectory,

19:41.927 --> 19:44.225
- won't line up.
- KARI: Okay, here's the laser.

19:44.296 --> 19:47.197
KARI: And... lined with the hole.
Can you see it all the way?

19:47.266 --> 19:49.291
TORY: [Lisping]
Science is so unforgiving.

19:49.368 --> 19:51.131
- GRANT: [Chuckles]
- The bullet didn't curve.

19:51.203 --> 19:53.228
We can see the laser
down at this end.

19:54.139 --> 19:55.333
[Gunshot]

19:55.941 --> 19:58.102
KARI: Now, for us,
this confirms that human speed

19:58.177 --> 20:00.338
is not going to curve a bullet.

20:00.412 --> 20:02.676
We did it ourselves.
We tried it with the robot.

20:02.748 --> 20:04.113
Now it's time to ramp it up

20:04.183 --> 20:06.674
and see if superhuman strength
is gonna curve it.

20:12.024 --> 20:16.324
NARRATOR: Can a sonic boom
from a bullet break glass?

20:17.062 --> 20:19.587
Adam and Jamie
are about to find out.

20:19.665 --> 20:22.896
[British accent] Right, little
bullet, here is your motivation,

20:22.968 --> 20:24.230
here's how it's gonna work.

20:24.303 --> 20:26.601
We're gonna put you
down the barrel of this

20:26.672 --> 20:28.367
and then Jamie...
I know how you like Jamie...

20:28.440 --> 20:29.566
is gonna pull the trigger.

20:29.642 --> 20:32.167
[Normal voice]
Sonic boom from 71/2 inches!

20:32.244 --> 20:33.836
[British accent]
At that point, I would really

20:33.913 --> 20:36.006
appreciate it
if you used all your gases

20:36.081 --> 20:37.412
expanding in that direction

20:37.483 --> 20:40.384
to start traveling down this way
towards the glass.

20:40.452 --> 20:44.115
Right,
about 1,984 miles per hour.

20:44.189 --> 20:45.486
In 3...

20:45.558 --> 20:48.550
I'd like you then to travel down
the middle part of the glass,

20:48.627 --> 20:50.356
past the glass,
past the glassware,

20:50.429 --> 20:51.987
the light bulbs,
the wine bottle.

20:52.064 --> 20:53.088
...2...

20:53.165 --> 20:55.030
And then if you feel like it,

20:55.100 --> 20:57.568
if the physics are right
and you're in the mood

20:57.636 --> 21:00.605
and you'd like to break
some glass with your sonic boom,

21:00.673 --> 21:02.140
you go right ahead.

21:02.207 --> 21:03.333
...1.

21:03.409 --> 21:05.434
[Gunshot]

21:06.879 --> 21:08.710
[Normal voice]
That is a hell of a thud.

21:09.682 --> 21:13.584
NARRATOR: A thud Adam and Jamie
could feel through the air...

21:14.386 --> 21:18.618
...but a thud for which
the glassware didn't care.

21:18.691 --> 21:20.625
ADAM:
It all looks pristine.

21:20.693 --> 21:22.320
JAMIE:
It does.

21:23.128 --> 21:24.595
ADAM:
Dude, you can see the bullet.

21:24.663 --> 21:26.528
That's awesome.

21:27.366 --> 21:29.163
The shock wave
would be following behind it.

21:29.234 --> 21:30.292
If we were gonna see
anything,

21:30.369 --> 21:32.234
it would probably
be starting to happen now.

21:32.304 --> 21:33.965
JAMIE:
I don't see any movement.

21:34.039 --> 21:36.940
I can't believe from the thud
I feel from firing the weapon

21:37.009 --> 21:39.500
that I don't see a single...
anything.

21:40.546 --> 21:42.138
I think we got to push way in.

21:42.214 --> 21:44.409
- JAMIE: I do, too.
- Let's say 4 inches apart?

21:44.483 --> 21:46.007
2 inches each from the bullet?

21:46.085 --> 21:47.518
- JAMIE: Sounds good.
- All right.

21:47.586 --> 21:52.489
Based on the fact that we didn't
see any reaction before,

21:52.558 --> 21:53.991
I don't think it's gonna break.

21:54.059 --> 21:58.052
2 inches from center.
In 3, 2, 1.

21:58.130 --> 21:59.427
[Gunshot]

22:02.368 --> 22:04.598
NARRATOR:
As the high speed illustrates,

22:04.670 --> 22:07.639
there wasn't even
the slightest tremor.

22:07.706 --> 22:09.833
I-I-I don't see anything.

22:09.908 --> 22:12.968
I got to say if a bullet passed
that close to me,

22:13.045 --> 22:14.444
I'd be scared to death,

22:14.513 --> 22:18.142
and those glasses...
it's like nothing is happening.

22:18.217 --> 22:19.946
NARRATOR:
Which is enough evidence

22:20.019 --> 22:22.180
to convince our hirsute Hoosier.

22:22.254 --> 22:24.620
At this point, I don't think the
bullet is gonna break the glass.

22:24.690 --> 22:26.317
NARRATOR:
And with the glass lined up

22:26.392 --> 22:28.792
just half an inch
from the center line,

22:28.861 --> 22:32.194
contact with the banana-sized
 .50-caliber bullet

22:32.264 --> 22:35.062
is a distinct possibility.

22:35.134 --> 22:36.658
JAMIE: 3...

22:36.735 --> 22:38.134
2...

22:38.203 --> 22:39.192
1.

22:39.271 --> 22:40.295
[Gunshot]

22:45.811 --> 22:47.870
I don't think
that was a shock wave.

22:47.946 --> 22:49.072
Me neither.

22:49.148 --> 22:50.672
NARRATOR: Me too.

22:50.749 --> 22:54.412
That looked to be
a direct hit on the rig.

22:54.486 --> 22:55.350
ADAM:
See that right there?

22:55.421 --> 22:57.184
That's not a sonic boom.
That's a bullet hit.

22:57.256 --> 22:59.247
That's where the bullet
contacted the frame,

22:59.324 --> 23:02.054
started shattering glass,
and the glass itself,

23:02.127 --> 23:04.391
traveling with the bullet
all the way down the corridor,

23:04.463 --> 23:06.328
tearing crap up as it went.

23:06.398 --> 23:08.389
JAMIE: Yeah, the rest of this
is from the shrapnel,

23:08.467 --> 23:09.593
- probably, huh?
- ADAM: Yeah.

23:13.972 --> 23:15.803
- Where do we stand?
- All right, well,

23:15.874 --> 23:18.809
at no distance where the bullet
passed by the glass

23:18.877 --> 23:21.539
did we get any movement
from the glass.

23:21.613 --> 23:22.272
Check.

23:22.347 --> 23:24.781
At this point,
we don't have any evidence

23:24.850 --> 23:26.784
that a sonic boom, at least one
coming off a bullet,

23:26.852 --> 23:29.616
has any significant effect
on any thickness of glass.

23:29.688 --> 23:30.347
Check.

23:30.422 --> 23:32.117
King to pawn four.

23:32.191 --> 23:33.180
[Scoffs]

23:33.258 --> 23:34.657
Check.

23:34.727 --> 23:36.888
NARRATOR:
So, this part of the myth,

23:36.962 --> 23:39.795
a sonic boom
from a bullet breaking glass,

23:39.865 --> 23:44.268
is, like Adam's glass corridor,
well and truly busted.

23:46.071 --> 23:47.595
Adam and Jamie now know

23:47.673 --> 23:50.506
that the sonic shock wave
from a passing bullet,

23:50.576 --> 23:53.568
if they even create one,
doesn't break glass.

23:55.047 --> 23:58.141
So, really,
their best bet is the jet.

23:58.217 --> 24:00.151
And back at
the Naval Air Facility,

24:00.219 --> 24:05.350
Adam is all set to break
the sound barrier for science.

24:05.424 --> 24:06.482
Strap in.

24:06.558 --> 24:09.994
It's time to go supersonic.

24:10.796 --> 24:14.755
NARRATOR: Meanwhile, 55 miles
away in Yuma, Arizona...

24:14.833 --> 24:15.959
[Chuckles]

24:16.034 --> 24:17.729
Oh, there's a hissing sound.

24:17.803 --> 24:19.168
[Chuckles] Uh-oh.

24:19.238 --> 24:20.830
NARRATOR:
...Jamie is preparing

24:20.906 --> 24:24.808
a glass menagerie
for Adam's supersonic flybys.

24:24.877 --> 24:26.845
JAMIE: If you happen to have
a supersonic jet,

24:26.912 --> 24:28.971
you can't just go flying around
anywhere you want

24:29.047 --> 24:30.605
creating sonic boom.

24:30.682 --> 24:32.707
You got to come
to a place like this...

24:32.785 --> 24:35.276
the Marine Corps Air Station
in Yuma,

24:35.354 --> 24:38.187
which is one of the few places
you can legally do that.

24:38.257 --> 24:40.088
That's why we're here.

24:40.993 --> 24:43.894
Mythbusters/Blue Angels
test site.

24:43.962 --> 24:45.691
Plenty of space...

24:45.764 --> 24:47.527
[Bird screeches]

24:47.599 --> 24:49.760
...some nice shrubbery.

24:49.835 --> 24:53.828
Probably quite a few rattlers,
but we can build a house here.

24:59.878 --> 25:01.175
That ought to do it.

25:01.246 --> 25:02.941
And there's a glass window
in it.

25:04.683 --> 25:07.481
NARRATOR:
Yeah, it's all real glass.

25:07.553 --> 25:11.284
And what we need now is
a rundown of the test protocol.

25:11.356 --> 25:14.917
Okay, buddy, here's the deal.
Pay attention.

25:14.993 --> 25:16.153
We're here to see

25:16.228 --> 25:18.287
if we can break some glass
with a sonic boom,

25:18.363 --> 25:22.322
so Adam is up in the sky
in an F/A-18 Hornet.

25:22.401 --> 25:24.733
He's coming in
at supersonic speeds.

25:24.803 --> 25:27.829
He's gonna get lower and lower
with each pass.

25:27.906 --> 25:29.669
NARRATOR:
With Adam just moments away,

25:29.741 --> 25:31.936
the final piece
of the prep puzzle

25:32.010 --> 25:34.308
can be put into place
for the first test run.

25:36.081 --> 25:37.480
JAMIE:
We need to make sure

25:37.549 --> 25:39.449
we get a direct flyover
from the jets.

25:39.518 --> 25:41.452
So, how do you do that?

25:41.520 --> 25:43.681
Well, they're gonna put out
some smoke

25:43.755 --> 25:45.313
so that we can see
where they're at.

25:45.390 --> 25:47.119
WALBORN: We'll go ahead
and put our smoke on.

25:47.192 --> 25:48.318
Smoke on.

25:49.428 --> 25:50.952
Ah, there they are.

25:51.697 --> 25:53.790
And then we're gonna signal them
with a mirror

25:53.866 --> 25:55.891
so they know
right where to fly the jet.

25:55.968 --> 25:58.459
7, P.A.O.
Ready for 8,000-foot pass.

25:58.537 --> 25:59.868
ADAM: We just got word
from Jamie's team

25:59.938 --> 26:01.633
that they are ready
and waiting for us,

26:01.707 --> 26:03.902
and we are just about
to bypass them

26:03.976 --> 26:08.811
at faster than the speed
of sound at 8,000 feet.

26:08.881 --> 26:10.007
Here we go.

26:10.649 --> 26:12.879
NARRATOR: That's the cue
for Lieutenant Walborn

26:12.951 --> 26:16.512
to do the jet-fighter equivalent
of putting his foot down.

26:17.256 --> 26:18.655
WALBORN:
There goes the afterburners.

26:18.724 --> 26:20.351
Mach .85.

26:21.260 --> 26:22.693
Mach .9.

26:22.761 --> 26:24.752
Mach 1.

26:24.830 --> 26:26.730
Mach 1.03.

26:26.798 --> 26:30.256
NARRATOR: And because Mach 1
is the speed of sound,

26:30.335 --> 26:33.065
Adam Savage is now supersonic.

26:33.138 --> 26:34.969
ADAM:
Wow, this feels cool.

26:35.040 --> 26:36.905
Mach 1.06.

26:36.975 --> 26:38.169
[Jet engine roars]

26:38.243 --> 26:40.711
NARRATOR: So as they pass
directly overhead,

26:40.779 --> 26:42.906
they've got the speed they need.

26:42.981 --> 26:45.711
But with the test site
a speck in the distance,

26:45.784 --> 26:49.220
the impact on the ground
is distinctly underwhelming.

26:49.288 --> 26:51.381
- Was that supersonic?
- WOMAN: Yeah.

26:51.456 --> 26:53.754
That was no boom.
That was nothing.

26:53.825 --> 26:55.656
And we're slowing down.

26:55.727 --> 26:57.854
Back down to Mach .98.

26:57.930 --> 27:00.091
Oh, this is so cool.

27:00.165 --> 27:02.656
I've heard them louder than that
going over my house.

27:12.844 --> 27:15.312
NARRATOR: Kari, Grant, and Tory
have discovered

27:15.380 --> 27:18.349
that if you simply mimic
the movie "Wanted"...

27:19.384 --> 27:21.852
...you won't bend bullets.

27:21.920 --> 27:26.254
They've even built a deadly
accurate gunslinging robot,

27:26.325 --> 27:29.658
given it the exact same
sidearm action as the myth...

27:31.596 --> 27:35.396
...and still failed to get
anything but a straight shooter.

27:35.467 --> 27:36.661
The bullet didn't curve.

27:36.735 --> 27:39.397
NARRATOR: So, next up,
they're raising the bar

27:39.471 --> 27:40.961
and ramping up the robot.

27:41.039 --> 27:42.597
GRANT: So, the great thing
about this test

27:42.674 --> 27:45.404
is that the characters are
superhuman, not supernatural.

27:45.477 --> 27:48.469
They're not vampires.
They don't use magic.

27:48.547 --> 27:50.947
They don't have telekinetic
powers to curve the bullet.

27:51.016 --> 27:54.213
All it is is superhuman speed
and strength,

27:54.286 --> 27:56.618
and that we can do in abundance.

27:56.688 --> 27:58.679
We've calibrated the rig
to twice

27:58.757 --> 28:00.019
what a normal human can do.

28:00.092 --> 28:02.287
TORY: Loading the gun
with a live round.

28:02.361 --> 28:05.660
GRANT: Twice as fast.
We'll see how that goes.

28:05.731 --> 28:07.596
Ready!

28:08.333 --> 28:11.564
KARI: All right,
live round at superhuman speed.

28:11.636 --> 28:13.331
- GRANT: You ready?
- Let's get it on.

28:13.405 --> 28:14.565
Here we go, you guys.

28:14.639 --> 28:17.369
In 3, 2, 1!

28:17.442 --> 28:18.534
[Gunshot]

28:19.277 --> 28:21.871
Ha ha!
Center shot.

28:21.947 --> 28:25.212
NARRATOR: And the paper trail
once again neatly illustrates

28:25.283 --> 28:27.513
the path of the projectile.

28:27.586 --> 28:29.019
It's made it through
the second frame.

28:29.087 --> 28:29.781
Yeah.

28:29.855 --> 28:31.584
- Third.
- Yes!

28:31.656 --> 28:32.884
Fourth.

28:32.958 --> 28:35.426
And the fifth frame.
This is a good test.

28:35.494 --> 28:36.859
Let's check the alignment.

28:36.928 --> 28:38.225
KARI: Okay.

28:38.296 --> 28:39.558
Do you see the laser?

28:40.532 --> 28:42.397
Oh.
I see the laser.

28:42.467 --> 28:45.095
NARRATOR: Despite flicking
the robotic arm around

28:45.170 --> 28:46.535
at superhuman speeds,

28:46.605 --> 28:48.596
when the bullet
leaves the barrel,

28:48.673 --> 28:50.436
it leaves in a straight line.

28:50.509 --> 28:54.570
And that leaves this part
of the story done and busted.

28:55.380 --> 28:56.642
GRANT:
I know what you're thinking.

28:56.715 --> 28:57.841
You're sitting at home thinking,

28:57.916 --> 28:59.611
"The Mythbusters
gave up too soon!

28:59.684 --> 29:00.981
It was only one shot!"

29:01.053 --> 29:02.611
But look, here's the reality.

29:02.687 --> 29:04.882
This robot is capable
of swinging its arm

29:04.956 --> 29:07.891
harder and faster
than a major league hitter.

29:09.795 --> 29:13.629
Maybe if I saw 3/4 of an inch,
1/2 an inch,

29:13.698 --> 29:16.724
maybe even a 1/4 of an inch,
it would be worth continuing on.

29:16.802 --> 29:18.201
But you know what?

29:18.270 --> 29:21.433
We're not seeing
any deviation at all.

29:21.506 --> 29:22.768
It's time to move on.

29:23.675 --> 29:25.233
Mach 1.06.

29:25.310 --> 29:27.938
NARRATOR:
So far, Supersonic Savage

29:28.013 --> 29:31.813
has completed one
8,000-feet sonic-boom flyby.

29:31.883 --> 29:33.783
JAMIE:
Well, that was 8,000 feet,

29:33.852 --> 29:36.650
and it was 1.06 mach.

29:36.721 --> 29:38.018
That was nothing.

29:39.024 --> 29:41.686
NARRATOR:
But they're not done yet.

29:41.760 --> 29:45.025
This time, they're ramping it up
by bringing it down.

29:45.097 --> 29:46.724
ADAM:
We are banking into position.

29:46.798 --> 29:48.993
We're getting
to 2,000 feet elevation

29:49.067 --> 29:53.697
in order to do
another supersonic pass.

29:53.772 --> 29:56.707
JAMIE:
Sonic boom from 2,000 feet.

29:56.775 --> 30:00.438
Well, that's a lot closer
than 8,000, so...

30:00.512 --> 30:01.740
it might do it.

30:01.813 --> 30:03.644
ADAM:
All right, we are accelerating.

30:03.715 --> 30:05.740
Mach 1.

30:05.817 --> 30:08.342
Mach 1.03.

30:08.420 --> 30:10.081
We are headed straight for them.

30:10.155 --> 30:12.589
2,000 feet at Mach 1.07.

30:12.657 --> 30:14.557
NARRATOR:
It seems so peaceful...

30:14.626 --> 30:17.652
Adam flying overhead
at the speed of sound,

30:17.729 --> 30:21.096
- and then...
- [Boom]

30:21.166 --> 30:22.633
Wow.

30:22.701 --> 30:24.134
That was something.

30:24.202 --> 30:26.067
I call that a bull's-eye.

30:26.138 --> 30:29.232
[Laughing]

30:29.307 --> 30:31.434
NARRATOR:
It's a classic sonic boom

30:31.510 --> 30:33.876
and a classic illustration
of the difference

30:33.945 --> 30:37.642
between the speed of light
and the speed of sound.

30:37.716 --> 30:42.278
You see the supersonic jet
fly by in silence.

30:42.354 --> 30:46.313
Then the sound,
moving at 761 miles per hour...

30:46.391 --> 30:48.222
[Boom]

30:48.293 --> 30:49.590
...catches up.

30:54.166 --> 30:58.227
But the big question is,
did it do any actual damage?

30:58.303 --> 30:59.600
Nothing.

30:59.671 --> 31:01.366
It's all intact.

31:01.439 --> 31:05.239
NARRATOR: So it's a question of,
"How low can you legally go?"

31:05.310 --> 31:08.302
Like some kind of
supersonic limbo dance,

31:08.380 --> 31:11.178
the guys bring it down
one more notch.

31:11.249 --> 31:12.910
We're commencing
the 500-foot run.

31:12.984 --> 31:14.246
We're accelerating now.

31:14.319 --> 31:16.514
We got to see some broken glass!

31:18.256 --> 31:20.315
Okay, he just came over
the horizon.

31:20.392 --> 31:21.620
500 feet.

31:21.693 --> 31:23.957
ADAM:
Mach 1.03.

31:24.029 --> 31:26.327
Oh, we are headed
straight for them.

31:26.398 --> 31:29.128
This doesn't feel like 500 feet.
It feels like 50 feet.

31:29.201 --> 31:30.998
Mach 1.05.

31:31.069 --> 31:33.401
Oh, I can totally see them
right there.

31:33.471 --> 31:34.938
This one is for the money.

31:35.006 --> 31:36.564
Oh, no!

31:36.641 --> 31:38.541
[Chuckles]

31:38.610 --> 31:40.771
[Boom]

31:40.845 --> 31:42.403
Wow!

31:42.480 --> 31:43.970
[Chuckles]

31:44.049 --> 31:45.516
NARRATOR:
That was loud.

31:45.584 --> 31:47.575
[Boom]

31:47.652 --> 31:49.085
Really loud.

31:49.154 --> 31:50.587
[Boom]

31:50.655 --> 31:53.590
But despite the powerful
ground-level experience...

31:53.658 --> 31:54.682
[Boom]

31:54.759 --> 31:55.691
[Boom]

31:55.760 --> 31:59.526
...the myth that a sonic boom
equals shattered glass

31:59.598 --> 32:01.759
is looking busted.

32:02.567 --> 32:07.231
Not one single item of glassware
was even splintered.

32:08.173 --> 32:09.606
No broken glass.

32:09.674 --> 32:11.335
Not looking good at this point.

32:11.409 --> 32:13.536
NARRATOR:
Not at this geographical point.

32:13.612 --> 32:16.376
But a few hundred feet away
at base camp,

32:16.448 --> 32:18.348
the team make
an interesting discovery.

32:18.416 --> 32:19.849
- Hey, Pete.
- CARNICELLI: Hi, Jamie.

32:19.918 --> 32:21.351
What do you got?

32:21.419 --> 32:23.910
Well, what happened was,
on the 500-foot pass,

32:23.989 --> 32:26.082
the sonic boom
ripped through this trailer,

32:26.157 --> 32:28.250
opened up all the cabinets,
and came out

32:28.326 --> 32:31.295
right here on the skylight
and blew it completely off.

32:31.363 --> 32:34.696
Yep, just like a pop top
on a soda can. [Chuckles]

32:38.169 --> 32:39.761
NARRATOR:
Kari, Grant, and Tory

32:39.838 --> 32:43.035
have ramped up their robot
to superhuman speeds,

32:43.108 --> 32:46.908
but the sidearm action used
to bend bullets in the movie

32:46.978 --> 32:49.811
just doesn't work in real life.

32:50.749 --> 32:53.650
Nothing!
This is more fake film physics.

32:53.718 --> 32:56.312
Whoa, whoa, we can't go
busting this myth yet.

32:56.388 --> 32:59.221
They did have a cool collection
of customized guns.

32:59.291 --> 33:01.725
And special engraved bullets.

33:01.793 --> 33:03.124
Okay, I see where
you're going with this.

33:03.194 --> 33:04.559
Maybe it's not just
the sidearm flick

33:04.629 --> 33:05.891
that gives us
the curving bullet.

33:05.964 --> 33:08.057
Exactly. Maybe it's a function
of altering the bullets

33:08.133 --> 33:10.966
and guns themselves that's
giving the bullets that curve.

33:11.036 --> 33:12.697
It seems logical...
you change the surface

33:12.771 --> 33:14.238
of the bullet or its balance,

33:14.306 --> 33:15.796
that could affect
the trajectory.

33:15.874 --> 33:17.865
- But what about the gun?
- The thing that makes the bullet

33:17.942 --> 33:19.500
go straight is the rifling
in the barrel.

33:19.577 --> 33:20.635
Yeah, the helical grooves

33:20.712 --> 33:23.112
cause the bullet to go into
a self-stabilizing spiral.

33:23.181 --> 33:26.082
So, I guess the next step...
take the rifling out of the gun,

33:26.151 --> 33:29.314
alter the bullets,
and see if we get a curve.

33:29.387 --> 33:31.878
NARRATOR: So, in their final bid
to bend the bullet,

33:31.956 --> 33:33.514
Kari takes on the task

33:33.591 --> 33:36.651
of smoothing out
the gun barrel's rifling.

33:36.728 --> 33:39.526
That should do it.
We have a smooth barrel.

33:39.597 --> 33:41.497
NARRATOR: Meanwhile,
Tory has been attempting

33:41.566 --> 33:45.229
to upset the bullet's
finely balanced aerodynamics.

33:45.303 --> 33:47.100
The three sets of bullets
are done.

33:47.172 --> 33:49.970
The first set I've changed just
the aerodynamics of the bullet,

33:50.041 --> 33:52.236
and the way I've done that
is I've taken a hacksaw

33:52.310 --> 33:55.177
and cut grooves
along one side of the bullet.

33:55.246 --> 33:57.976
The other set, what I've done
is I've changed the weight,

33:58.049 --> 33:59.983
and the way I've done this is
I've drilled out

34:00.051 --> 34:01.643
half of the bullet,
and then I filled it

34:01.720 --> 34:04.484
with car-body filler,
so that way it's unbalanced.

34:04.556 --> 34:06.956
Finally, the third set of
bullets, I've incorporated both

34:07.025 --> 34:08.253
where I've drilled out
half the bullet.

34:08.326 --> 34:09.815
This way,
it is no longer balanced,

34:09.893 --> 34:11.623
and it's no longer aerodynamic.

34:11.696 --> 34:13.425
NARRATOR:
And with the ammo altered

34:13.498 --> 34:15.022
and their gun barrel smooth...

34:15.100 --> 34:16.498
I'm gonna make some arrests.

34:16.568 --> 34:18.728
NARRATOR: It's back
to the South San Francisco

34:18.803 --> 34:20.327
- Police Department.
- Calling all car...

34:20.405 --> 34:21.895
- Can I get my bike back?
- Sorry.

34:21.973 --> 34:23.201
[Siren wails]

34:23.274 --> 34:26.107
NARRATOR: Inside the firing
range, in order to capture

34:26.177 --> 34:28.804
the all-important
high-speed camera shots,

34:28.880 --> 34:32.543
the team is reverting to
a stationary shooting position.

34:32.617 --> 34:36.246
And first up,
the team fires off a few shots

34:36.321 --> 34:39.654
with a regular gun
and the altered bullets.

34:39.724 --> 34:42.248
But on each occasion,
there was no bend

34:42.327 --> 34:44.625
to the bullet's flight path.

34:45.196 --> 34:47.130
GRANT:
But I think when we switch

34:47.197 --> 34:49.393
to the barrel
that has no rifling,

34:49.467 --> 34:51.900
all bets are gonna be off,
and that bullet is gonna do

34:51.969 --> 34:52.994
whatever it wants to.

34:53.071 --> 34:54.936
NARRATOR:
And from the very first test

34:55.005 --> 34:56.632
with a grooved bullet...

34:56.708 --> 34:58.869
Okay, grooved bullet,
derifled gun.

34:58.943 --> 35:00.342
[Gunshot]

35:00.412 --> 35:03.040
NARRATOR: It's clear
how important rifling is.

35:03.114 --> 35:04.081
Whoa!

35:04.149 --> 35:09.382
Look at how wild that bullet
went without the rifling.

35:10.588 --> 35:13.182
NARRATOR: Yep, one look
at the first pane of paper,

35:13.258 --> 35:17.058
and you can see the bullet
must have gone through sideways.

35:17.128 --> 35:19.995
- That was incredible.
- What the heck happened?

35:20.064 --> 35:22.999
NARRATOR: But despite
the head-over-heels flight,

35:23.067 --> 35:25.900
it still traced a straight line
through the air.

35:25.970 --> 35:27.130
Look at that.

35:27.205 --> 35:28.900
It's a straight path.

35:28.973 --> 35:31.567
NARRATOR: And no matter
how the bullet is altered...

35:31.643 --> 35:33.235
grooved...

35:33.311 --> 35:35.541
unbalanced...

35:35.613 --> 35:38.776
and a combination of both...

35:38.850 --> 35:41.410
the result is the same
every time.

35:41.486 --> 35:42.748
- TORY: Whoa!
- KARI: Whoa!

35:42.821 --> 35:44.550
TORY: Look at how unstable
the bullets are

35:44.622 --> 35:46.214
now that there's no rifling.

35:46.291 --> 35:48.020
Yeah, it's, like,
going, "Pshew!"

35:48.092 --> 35:49.252
TORY:
But still, it's not curving.

35:49.327 --> 35:50.760
- GRANT: No.
- NARRATOR: It's clear

35:50.829 --> 35:54.356
that the massive forward
momentum of a speeding bullet...

35:54.432 --> 35:55.421
No.

35:55.500 --> 35:56.592
Straight path.

35:56.668 --> 35:58.363
NARRATOR:
...simply overrides

35:58.436 --> 36:02.566
any minor adjustments
to its aerodynamics or balance.

36:02.640 --> 36:05.336
So, it's looking like
no matter what we do,

36:05.410 --> 36:06.775
physics are working
against us.

36:06.845 --> 36:07.834
We cannot curve a bullet.

36:07.912 --> 36:09.880
It doesn't matter
if the barrel's rifled or not.

36:09.948 --> 36:11.882
Doesn't matter if the bullets
are altered or not.

36:11.950 --> 36:12.974
So, this one's busted.

36:13.051 --> 36:14.143
- Busted.
- Busted.

36:19.224 --> 36:20.350
[Boom]

36:20.425 --> 36:21.687
JAMIE: Wow!

36:21.759 --> 36:23.124
[Chuckles]

36:23.194 --> 36:26.095
ADAM: So, our 500-foot pass
did not break any glass.

36:26.164 --> 36:27.563
Nothing.

36:27.632 --> 36:28.599
ADAM:
What's gonna happen now is,

36:28.666 --> 36:30.258
I'm gonna get in a chase plane

36:30.335 --> 36:33.998
and follow Ben as he begins
to do lower and lower passes

36:34.072 --> 36:35.039
over our test site,

36:35.106 --> 36:37.370
also increasing
his angle of attack

36:37.442 --> 36:41.640
to focus the sonic boom right
on ground zero, on our house.

36:41.713 --> 36:43.704
I swear,
we are incredibly close.

36:43.781 --> 36:45.373
NARRATOR:
So, without a single sign

36:45.450 --> 36:47.748
of the mythical
glass-shattering result,

36:47.819 --> 36:51.585
the team is ramping it up
with some fancy flying.

36:51.656 --> 36:55.353
This time we're coming in
nose down at about 5 degrees.

36:55.426 --> 36:57.951
We think this might focus
the boom a little bit more

36:58.029 --> 37:00.520
and give us what we want.

37:02.433 --> 37:04.993
There they are.

37:05.069 --> 37:08.835
[Boom]

37:08.907 --> 37:10.272
Man, that's a rush.

37:10.341 --> 37:12.969
NARRATOR: Before Jamie can
get in and check the results,

37:13.044 --> 37:14.944
Ben blasts by...

37:15.013 --> 37:17.880
[Boom]

37:17.949 --> 37:20.042
...twice more
in quick succession.

37:20.118 --> 37:22.245
[Boom]

37:22.320 --> 37:25.585
And this time,
damage is definitely done.

37:25.657 --> 37:26.749
JAMIE:
No window.

37:26.824 --> 37:28.792
I can see it from here.

37:28.860 --> 37:32.853
NARRATOR: A broken window,
but not exactly as per the myth.

37:32.931 --> 37:35.661
Oh, no.

37:35.733 --> 37:39.396
It blew the window out of its
hole, but it didn't break it.

37:41.272 --> 37:45.834
NARRATOR: The three rapid-fire,
low-altitude, supersonic flybys

37:45.910 --> 37:47.537
have clearly had an effect.

37:47.612 --> 37:50.672
Ah, the plot thickens.

37:50.748 --> 37:52.306
That broke the door.

37:52.383 --> 37:54.351
NARRATOR:
But the jury is still out

37:54.419 --> 37:57.183
on whether it will specifically
break glass.

37:57.255 --> 37:58.483
It didn't break
any of the glass.

37:58.556 --> 38:00.046
It knocked it down, though.

38:00.124 --> 38:02.354
NARRATOR: And that
has got Jamie thinking.

38:02.427 --> 38:04.657
JAMIE: A sonic boom
is just a pressure wave.

38:04.729 --> 38:07.960
We've created a lot of
pressure waves on Mythbusters.

38:08.032 --> 38:12.298
We've put out fires with them.
We've broken wine glasses.

38:12.370 --> 38:15.032
But on the other hand,
we've tried to make people poop

38:15.106 --> 38:17.074
and we've tried
to blow up cars with them.

38:17.141 --> 38:18.506
Those didn't work too well.

38:18.576 --> 38:21.704
Sometimes they just don't behave
the way you expect...

38:21.779 --> 38:24.009
from reflections,
from harmonics,

38:24.082 --> 38:26.016
from all sorts of subtle details

38:26.084 --> 38:29.485
that you only figure out
after a lot of experimentation.

38:29.554 --> 38:31.818
NARRATOR:
And that further experimentation

38:31.889 --> 38:35.017
is a set
of five 200-foot passes,

38:35.093 --> 38:37.653
which is as low
as we can legally go,

38:37.729 --> 38:42.666
lower than anything seen
outside the training zone.

38:42.734 --> 38:44.395
These things
are coming in so low,

38:44.469 --> 38:46.903
we're not gonna see them
until they're on top of us.

38:46.971 --> 38:48.836
WALBORN:
Blowers ready now.

38:48.906 --> 38:51.033
[Engine roars]

38:51.109 --> 38:53.043
[Boom]

38:53.111 --> 38:54.976
JAMIE: Wow.

38:55.046 --> 38:56.638
That's intense.

38:56.714 --> 38:58.807
WALBORN:
Coming in tight.

38:58.883 --> 38:59.815
[Boom]

38:59.884 --> 39:03.376
- Ready, hit it.
- [Boom]

39:03.454 --> 39:04.580
[Speaks indistinctly]

39:05.289 --> 39:06.847
[Boom]

39:06.924 --> 39:08.551
MAN:
T-minus 330.

39:09.260 --> 39:11.387
[Boom]

39:11.462 --> 39:13.191
Unh!

39:13.264 --> 39:15.289
That kind of wakes you up
in the morning.

39:15.366 --> 39:17.630
[Laughing]

39:18.870 --> 39:21.737
JAMIE: Well, that right there
were five sonic booms

39:21.806 --> 39:27.039
hitting that house and the car
and the glassware, at 200 feet.

39:27.111 --> 39:28.976
I got to go check it out.

39:29.814 --> 39:32.009
What the heck?

39:32.083 --> 39:33.209
Nothing!

39:33.284 --> 39:37.311
NARRATOR: Like the glassware,
the car escaped unscathed.

39:37.388 --> 39:38.821
JAMIE:
Well, it didn't break it,

39:38.890 --> 39:41.381
but it knocked off
the rearview mirror.

39:41.459 --> 39:43.017
NARRATOR:
Well, almost.

39:43.094 --> 39:46.757
But over at the house,
it's a whole different story.

39:48.299 --> 39:49.231
[Boom]

39:49.300 --> 39:51.700
[Boom]

39:51.769 --> 39:54.135
That's what I'm talking about.

39:54.205 --> 39:56.833
That is one broken window.

39:56.908 --> 39:58.068
It not only broke it

39:58.142 --> 40:02.909
but it just, like, shattered
every little bit to smithereens.

40:02.980 --> 40:04.413
So, it can happen.

40:04.482 --> 40:05.574
[Chuckles]

40:05.650 --> 40:07.618
- Oh, no!
- [Boom]

40:07.685 --> 40:12.054
NARRATOR: So, it is possible to
break glass with a sonic boom...

40:14.225 --> 40:18.594
...but not any old glass
from any old sonic boom.

40:18.663 --> 40:20.358
The glassware is intact,

40:20.431 --> 40:22.399
and it was the warping
of the window frame

40:22.467 --> 40:26.836
that led to the only breakage.

40:26.904 --> 40:28.132
And let's face it...

40:28.206 --> 40:31.664
that only happened
after the low-altitude passes

40:31.743 --> 40:33.677
that just don't happen anywhere

40:33.745 --> 40:36.441
but in these restricted
training zones.

40:39.751 --> 40:42.311
JAMIE: So, Tyson,
I've been meaning to ask you.

40:42.386 --> 40:44.320
We're out here in the dessert.

40:44.388 --> 40:46.822
You look like you just came from
the laundry with that thing.

40:46.891 --> 40:49.223
What do you do
if you spill your lunch on it?

40:49.293 --> 40:50.385
DUNKELBERGER: I don't.

40:50.461 --> 40:52.326
JAMIE: Oh. Okay.

40:53.798 --> 40:56.767
Well, I'm looking at a broken
piece of glass here, man.

40:56.834 --> 40:58.927
Does that mean
the fans are vindicated?

40:59.003 --> 41:01.995
That's the only thing
that the sonic boom broke.

41:02.073 --> 41:04.007
What about all the other glass
that didn't break?

41:04.075 --> 41:05.337
There were car windows.

41:05.409 --> 41:07.400
There was a table
full of this kind of stuff.

41:07.478 --> 41:08.410
None of it broke.

41:08.479 --> 41:10.140
Well, I mean,
the myth clearly states

41:10.214 --> 41:12.614
that any sonic boom
will break any glass,

41:12.683 --> 41:13.945
and, apparently,
that didn't happen.

41:14.018 --> 41:16.953
And we had to fly the jet in
at ridiculously low levels

41:17.021 --> 41:18.716
to make this break.

41:18.790 --> 41:21.281
Well, then, I think
the answer is pretty clear.

41:21.359 --> 41:23.520
- It's busted.
- Totally busted.
