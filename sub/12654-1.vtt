It is time.

The evil Yan-Lo has awakened
and is on his way.

01:20.224 --> 01:26.787
But I wonder
if you're committed enough
to take on this task.

01:26.797 --> 01:28.155
Forgive me, master.

01:28.156 --> 01:29.623
I am ready.

01:29.624 --> 01:31.561
Very well.

I will not let
you down, master.

02:09.824 --> 02:11.762
Thank you for returning
to earth, miss Wu.

Can you identify
this mountain range...

Mr. Medina. Bye.

02:28.525 --> 02:30.953
Wendy, could this class
be any more boring?

02:30.963 --> 02:33.261
I know.
I feel like drawing
eyes on my eyelids

02:33.262 --> 02:36.557
So I can take a nap.

02:40.663 --> 02:44.828
We were so perfect
for each other.

02:44.829 --> 02:46.057
Why? Why?

02:46.058 --> 02:47.855
Lisa, get it together.

02:47.856 --> 02:49.654
You're getting tears
all over my top.

02:49.664 --> 02:51.053
I'm sorry.

02:51.063 --> 02:53.620
Thank you for
letting me borrow it.

02:53.630 --> 02:57.187
You know what's the fastest
way to get over a guy?

02:57.197 --> 02:59.323
Both: get a new guy.

02:59.324 --> 03:01.192
Forget it.

03:01.193 --> 03:03.690
My life stinks.

03:03.960 --> 03:06.987
Why can't I have
your perfect life, Wen?

03:06.997 --> 03:10.093
You're the most
popular girl in school.

03:10.094 --> 03:12.090
Everyone's going
to vote for you

No, he's not.

03:17.097 --> 03:18.854
I got us salads, Wen.

03:18.855 --> 03:21.092
Ok. He's
a little perfect.

03:21.093 --> 03:22.090
I mean, you don't need it,

03:22.091 --> 03:23.221
But I'm trying
to cut my triceps

03:23.231 --> 03:26.656
For short-sleeved
shirts. So...you know,

03:26.657 --> 03:27.756
And I got some...

03:31.822 --> 03:32.721
That is so lame.

03:32.731 --> 03:33.958
Yeah. You're right.

03:33.959 --> 03:35.528
My guns already
look good.

03:35.529 --> 03:36.926
No. I mean Jessica.

03:36.927 --> 03:38.095

03:38.096 --> 03:40.592
Thanks, guys.

03:40.593 --> 03:43.091
Jessica Dawson
is running against you
for homecoming queen?

03:43.092 --> 03:45.827
I so should
have expected this.

03:45.828 --> 03:47.127
Ever since second grade,

03:47.128 --> 03:49.623
Everything I do,
she has to do.

03:49.624 --> 03:51.021
Well, this one's mine.

03:51.022 --> 03:54.519
Nobody's going
to give her my vote
for a stale cookie.

03:54.529 --> 03:56.088
Even your brother?

03:56.098 --> 03:58.125

04:15.159 --> 04:18.524
Jessica, you're running
for homecoming queen?

04:18.524 --> 04:20.154
Oh, my gosh.
That's so awesome.

04:20.164 --> 04:23.089
Well, I probably don't
stand a chance against you.

04:23.090 --> 04:25.159
I'm the one who should
just drop out.

04:25.160 --> 04:27.886
Ok.

04:28.056 --> 04:30.224
This is going
to be so much fun.

04:30.224 --> 04:31.791
Yeah. Good luck.

04:31.792 --> 04:33.260
Thanks.

04:34.090 --> 04:36.058
What is wrong
with you, Peter?

04:36.059 --> 04:38.254
Chill out.
It's just a cookie.

04:38.255 --> 04:39.223
Spit that out.

04:39.224 --> 04:41.053
That looks
like my brother

04:41.063 --> 04:42.122
Doesn't support
his sister.

04:42.123 --> 04:44.488
Have a little
loyalty here.

04:44.489 --> 04:45.487
Fine.

04:45.488 --> 04:46.987
I hate raisins anyway.

Jessica: hey, Austin.

04:48.127 --> 04:49.673
Hey, little sis.

04:49.674 --> 04:51.222
You might want to check
on your loyalty over there.

04:51.223 --> 04:53.021
Want one of my cookies?

04:53.031 --> 04:54.059

04:59.564 --> 05:01.591
Mom, this is important.

05:01.592 --> 05:02.559
Don't you remember?

05:02.560 --> 05:04.120
I do my report on Florida,

05:04.130 --> 05:06.227
Then she has
to do hers on texas

05:06.228 --> 05:08.055
Just because it's bigger.

05:08.056 --> 05:09.554
And in fourth grade,

05:09.564 --> 05:11.252
When I broke my arm and
everyone signed my cast,

05:11.262 --> 05:15.957
Jessica had everyone
sign her leg and it
wasn't even broken.

05:15.958 --> 05:18.524
Wendy, what do
you want me to do?

05:18.525 --> 05:21.091
I'm at work here
and I have an exhibit
opening in two weeks.

05:21.092 --> 05:24.120
But mom, this is supposed
to be my homecoming

05:24.130 --> 05:25.588
And she's going
to take it away from me

05:25.589 --> 05:28.995
If I don't come up with
a way to get more votes.

05:30.893 --> 05:32.761
Oops!

05:35.129 --> 05:37.056
Look, honey.

05:37.057 --> 05:38.993
I understand how important
this is to you,

05:38.994 --> 05:40.961
But the museum director's
counting on me

05:40.962 --> 05:42.921
To put together
this exhibit of ancient
chinese artifacts

05:42.931 --> 05:44.908
And I'm getting
stressed out

05:44.909 --> 05:46.887
Because I don't
know the history behind
any of them.

05:46.897 --> 05:49.554
I used to think
my mother's stories

05:49.564 --> 05:52.620
About the buddhist
legends were so silly.

05:52.621 --> 05:54.857
I should have
listened to her more.

05:54.858 --> 05:57.554
Mom, what am I going
to do about Jessica?

05:57.555 --> 05:59.073
You know what
you're going to do?

05:59.074 --> 06:00.591
You're going
to forget about
homecoming for a minute

06:00.592 --> 06:04.090
And remember that
there are some things
more important in life.

06:04.091 --> 06:06.416
Like what?

06:06.417 --> 06:08.733
Like maybe your
responsibilities at home.

06:08.734 --> 06:11.053
When is the last time
you did some laundry
or cleaned your room?

06:11.063 --> 06:12.570
Or fed your dog.

06:12.571 --> 06:14.088

your brother's
such a messy eater

06:14.089 --> 06:16.527

would have starved.

for you instead?

american soap operas so
that we can all understand?

I do. Spanish ones.

of the research,

I'm missing some of the
folklore and legends.

08:31.223 --> 08:33.659
I told you the stories.

08:33.659 --> 08:34.827
I know you did, ma,

But I was too little
to appreciate them.

not like I missed

culture in my life.

don't miss it doesn't
mean it isn't missing.

14:27.056 --> 14:28.624
Pick one of my "Jessica
for homecoming queen"

14:28.625 --> 14:30.622
Cupcakes tomorrow.

14:32.021 --> 14:35.886
Aah!

14:35.887 --> 14:37.655
[Whines]

15:13.090 --> 15:15.558
[Whines]

18:03.629 --> 18:05.756
No! No! Ohh!

18:05.757 --> 18:07.256
[Whines]

19:08.255 --> 19:10.622
[Growling]

19:11.761 --> 19:14.059
Whoa.

19:14.558 --> 19:16.886
I'm home?

19:17.226 --> 19:19.053
Cool.

19:19.054 --> 19:20.892
Ow.

19:22.261 --> 19:24.727
Ow.

19:24.728 --> 19:26.056
Ow.

19:26.057 --> 19:28.225
Ow.

19:36.797 --> 19:38.825
Wow. These are really
made out of clay?

19:38.826 --> 19:41.591
Yeah. They're
terracotta warriors.

19:41.592 --> 19:43.760
There were 6,000 of them
buried in the tomb

19:43.761 --> 19:46.756
Of the first emperor
of china in 210 B.C.

19:46.757 --> 19:49.622
And the chinese government
sent us 8 of them.

19:49.623 --> 19:50.753
Isn't that great?

19:50.763 --> 19:51.652
Sure.

19:51.662 --> 19:52.759
You see, the first emperor,

19:52.760 --> 19:54.219
Qin Shi Huangdi
was buried with them

19:54.229 --> 19:55.856
Because the people believed
they would guard them

19:55.857 --> 19:57.624
In the afterlife,
but they didn't.

19:57.625 --> 20:00.253
There's a legend that
says every 90 years

20:00.263 --> 20:03.089
They come under the spell
of Yan-Lo.

20:03.090 --> 20:04.319
An evil spirit.

20:04.329 --> 20:06.276
[Cackles]

20:06.277 --> 20:08.225
I've never seen you
this excited about
chinese history before.

20:08.226 --> 20:10.153
I know.
It's weird.

20:10.163 --> 20:13.720
We didn't care about this
when we were kids, did we?

20:13.721 --> 20:17.286
<i>No. "Everybody wang chungs tonight" is about as cultural as we got.</i>

20:17.726 --> 20:19.553
Oh! I got to go.

20:19.554 --> 20:20.653
Gonna be late.

20:20.663 --> 20:24.789
Oh wappa cho-Ah!

20:25.628 --> 20:26.787
Hyah!

20:26.797 --> 20:28.254
Stop it.

20:28.255 --> 20:29.724
The neighbors are going
to see you.

20:29.725 --> 20:30.622
Ah!

20:30.623 --> 20:31.692
See you later, dad.

20:31.693 --> 20:32.660
Bye.

20:32.661 --> 20:33.520
Where's Peter?

20:33.530 --> 20:35.876
He's still sleeping.

20:35.877 --> 20:38.225
Uh, he put
this ugly necklace
on me last night.

20:38.226 --> 20:39.793
Very funny, Peter.

20:39.794 --> 20:41.520
Oh, I should
get going, too.

20:41.521 --> 20:42.761
I'm going to be late.

20:42.762 --> 20:44.258
Mom, what's this?

20:44.259 --> 20:45.628
It's Gingi mountain temple.

20:45.629 --> 20:47.655
Dates back over 1,500 years.

20:47.656 --> 20:49.524
No, no, no.
These bald guys.

20:49.525 --> 20:51.252
They're monks.

20:51.262 --> 20:53.659
Well, don't they
have ponytails?

20:53.660 --> 20:55.857
Buddhist monks
shave their heads.

20:55.858 --> 20:57.355
Why are you asking?

20:57.356 --> 20:58.754
No reason.

20:58.755 --> 21:00.793
Got to go.

21:01.392 --> 21:02.520
Hey. Hey.

21:02.521 --> 21:03.658
Aren't you taking
your cupcakes?

21:03.659 --> 21:04.819
No. You take them.

21:04.829 --> 21:07.155
Bye.

21:07.156 --> 21:09.494
But they're
500 of them. Wendy!

21:31.362 --> 21:34.089
[Speaking chinese]

21:35.628 --> 21:37.825
[Speaking chinese]

22:10.323 --> 22:12.720
Hey, Wen.
Do you want a ride?

22:12.721 --> 22:14.319
Sure.

22:17.456 --> 22:19.423
Wait!

22:19.424 --> 22:20.722
You must wear this.

22:20.723 --> 22:22.560
Let's go.

22:22.561 --> 22:24.558
It will protect you.

22:24.559 --> 22:26.326
Be safe!

22:26.327 --> 22:28.085
Wendy, you must
wear this!

22:28.095 --> 22:28.943
Who's that?

22:28.944 --> 22:29.793
How should I know?
Just go.

22:29.794 --> 22:32.261
I think he knows you.

22:46.597 --> 22:48.353
So, just because
he I.M.'S me,

22:48.354 --> 22:50.223
He thinks I'll
come running back.

22:50.224 --> 22:51.591
What a jerk.

22:51.592 --> 22:52.958
Look, you just
stay strong and proud

22:52.959 --> 22:54.319
And if he
I.M.'S you again,
we'll start a rumor

22:54.329 --> 22:56.427
That you're already
going out with a senior.

22:56.428 --> 22:57.855
Right?

22:58.854 --> 23:01.091
Right?

23:01.092 --> 23:02.859
Oh, you didn't.

23:02.860 --> 23:04.718
You're back with him?

23:04.728 --> 23:06.526
Just a little.

23:06.527 --> 23:08.824
Do you believe her, Wen?

23:09.694 --> 23:11.421
Wen?

23:11.422 --> 23:12.490
What?

23:12.491 --> 23:14.158
Are you all right?

23:14.159 --> 23:15.825
You're not still
thinking about that guy

23:15.826 --> 23:17.556
In the bathrobe,
are you?

23:17.557 --> 23:19.493
No. Of course not. Why?

23:19.494 --> 23:22.561
'Cause here he comes.

23:24.828 --> 23:27.486
Go! The light's green! Go!

23:27.725 --> 23:30.222
[Tires screech]

23:30.223 --> 23:32.160
[Screaming]

23:32.161 --> 23:32.689
Wendy!

23:32.690 --> 23:34.158
Aah!

23:34.159 --> 23:35.487
Stop! Please!

23:35.488 --> 23:37.286
[Screaming]

23:37.296 --> 23:39.223
Stop!

23:39.224 --> 23:41.591
You're in danger!

23:41.592 --> 23:42.490
Stop!

23:42.491 --> 23:43.788
[Screaming]

23:43.789 --> 23:45.557
Please!

23:45.558 --> 23:48.693
Ooh! Ooh! Aah! Aah!

23:48.694 --> 23:52.490
Aaaaah!

23:52.491 --> 23:54.389
Ow!

23:54.688 --> 23:56.486
Uh!

23:56.487 --> 23:58.723
Wendy!

23:58.724 --> 24:01.591
Well, that was
really weird.

24:01.592 --> 24:03.119
Bizarre.

24:03.120 --> 24:04.658
I say we act like that
never happened.

24:04.659 --> 24:05.557
Cool.

24:05.558 --> 24:07.556
Absolutely.

24:10.692 --> 24:11.851
[Whistle]

24:11.861 --> 24:13.459
Come on, girls.

24:13.460 --> 24:15.157
Pick it up.
Pick it up.

24:15.158 --> 24:17.626
Hey, Wendy.
Did you see me
on tv last night?

24:17.627 --> 24:19.373
No. You were on tv?

24:19.374 --> 24:21.120
Yeah. I did the weather
on channel 5.

24:21.121 --> 24:22.391
I'm sorry.
I missed it.

24:22.392 --> 24:24.219
I was out
with Austin.

24:24.229 --> 24:25.776
Hey, Austin!

24:25.777 --> 24:27.326
Coach: pass it
on the inside!

24:27.327 --> 24:29.473
Come on!

24:29.474 --> 24:31.621
Keep your head
in the game, Wendy!

24:31.622 --> 24:33.219
[Grunts]

24:33.220 --> 24:34.558
Uh!
Uh!

24:34.559 --> 24:35.587
[Whistle]

24:35.588 --> 24:37.785
Nice play, Jessica.

24:37.795 --> 24:39.102
Saw you on tv last night.

24:39.103 --> 24:40.421
You're going to make
a great homecoming queen.

24:40.422 --> 24:42.119
Jessica:
thanks, coach Gibbs.

24:42.120 --> 24:43.819
Jessica, why don't
you goalie for a while?

24:43.829 --> 24:46.656
Tina! You're in.

24:50.263 --> 24:51.751
[Whistle]

24:51.761 --> 24:56.187
Girl: there you go,
there you go. Watch it!

24:56.527 --> 24:57.486
Can't see the ball!

24:57.496 --> 24:59.554
Coach:
come on, girls.

25:06.457 --> 25:10.323
Coach: that's it.
Pick it up. Energy!

25:14.129 --> 25:19.394
Aaaah!

25:20.423 --> 25:22.719
Uh! Aah! Uh!

25:22.720 --> 25:27.186
Girl: yes!
Way to go!

25:27.196 --> 25:28.893
Nice hustle!

25:28.894 --> 25:30.592
Coach:
ok. Let's give her
some air, ladies.

25:30.593 --> 25:31.521
Are you ok?

25:31.522 --> 25:33.219
How did you do that?

25:33.220 --> 25:34.258
I don't know.

25:34.259 --> 25:36.536
She had it coming.

25:36.537 --> 25:38.824
She's trying to steal
your popularity.

25:41.422 --> 25:44.159
I think I'm
giving it to her.

25:45.428 --> 25:47.625
[Grunting]

26:02.291 --> 26:06.157
How did you get
in here, fella?

26:17.825 --> 26:19.753
[Grunts]

26:20.822 --> 26:24.688
Huhh!

26:20.822 --> 26:24.688
Coach: that's it, girls!
Down and up!

26:24.689 --> 26:26.236
Oh, not you.

26:26.237 --> 26:27.785
Look, why are you
following me?

26:27.795 --> 26:30.102
What do you want?

26:30.103 --> 26:32.421
Please.
You are in much danger.

26:32.691 --> 26:35.318
Did you put that
on me last night?

26:35.328 --> 26:36.954
How did you get
in my house?

26:36.955 --> 26:39.524
I think you're starting
to creep me out.

26:39.525 --> 26:41.621
I'm turning you in.

26:41.622 --> 26:43.768
Believe me.

26:43.769 --> 26:45.917
I'm a buddhist monk
who has come a great
distance to find you.

26:45.927 --> 26:47.626
And that's another thing.

26:47.627 --> 26:49.153
You are not a monk.

26:49.154 --> 26:50.692
Buddhist monks
shave their heads.

26:50.693 --> 26:51.970
So there.

26:51.971 --> 26:53.248
I was allowed
to grow my hair

26:53.249 --> 26:54.519
So that I might fit in
when I found you.

26:54.529 --> 26:56.886
I don't know
what fashion magazines
you've been reading,

26:56.896 --> 27:00.922
But a stringy ponytail
and a weird robe
is not fitting in.

27:00.923 --> 27:04.358
But it is my destiny
to help you.

27:04.359 --> 27:05.357
Evil is near.

27:05.358 --> 27:07.555
Look, the only
evil I know

27:07.556 --> 27:09.821
Is my history teacher
and Jessica Dawson.

27:09.822 --> 27:11.691
And I don't think you can
help me with them.

27:11.692 --> 27:16.027
You find you have skills
you cannot explain.

27:18.994 --> 27:20.592
What do you mean?

27:20.593 --> 27:22.819
That kick on the field.

27:22.820 --> 27:25.627
Crude
but very powerful.

27:25.628 --> 27:29.053
It's a bicycle kick.

27:29.054 --> 27:32.490
Your ancestors would call
it dragon whips tail.

27:32.491 --> 27:35.068
Ok.

27:35.078 --> 27:37.653
I'll admit there's
been some weird stuff
going on with me lately.

27:37.654 --> 27:41.422
So I'm going to give
you like a minute
to tell me what's up.

27:41.423 --> 27:45.357
I have been
reincarnated many times
over the centuries

27:45.358 --> 27:48.025
To assist the descendant
of the yin warrior

27:48.026 --> 27:51.691
To battle evil
in the name of good.

27:52.660 --> 27:54.288
You know, yoda.

27:54.289 --> 27:55.917
This is already
getting a little too
star warsy for me.

27:55.927 --> 27:59.822
The evil is imprisoned
in the qanzi jade globe.

27:59.823 --> 28:04.458
It's called Yan-Lo,
a powerful spirit.

28:04.459 --> 28:06.006
Ooh, scary.

28:06.007 --> 28:07.554
Every 90 years,
the globe awakens,

28:07.555 --> 28:11.592
allowing him to
break free and possess
the bodies of mortals

28:11.593 --> 28:15.857
To challenge
the next descendent
of the yin warrior.

28:22.790 --> 28:25.318
That kind
of looks like me.

28:25.328 --> 28:27.685
I really don't like
where this is going.

28:27.695 --> 28:30.822
You must follow in the steps
of your ancestors.

28:30.823 --> 28:33.858
It is your turn
to defeat Yan-Lo.

28:33.859 --> 28:34.857
Me?

28:34.858 --> 28:35.857
Well, what if I don't?

28:35.858 --> 28:36.825
Famine...

28:36.826 --> 28:38.054
Earthquakes...

28:38.055 --> 28:39.592
Oceans rising...

28:39.593 --> 28:40.691
Locusts...

28:40.692 --> 28:41.491
Fires...

28:41.492 --> 28:42.520
Drought...

28:42.521 --> 28:43.668
Darkness.

28:43.669 --> 28:44.818
Ok, ok. I get it.
It's bad.

28:44.828 --> 28:46.285
Oh, there you are, Wen.

28:46.286 --> 28:48.285
Hey, we're going
to the mall.

28:48.295 --> 28:49.792
You want to come with?

28:49.793 --> 28:53.290
Your kung fu training
must begin now.

28:53.629 --> 28:55.557
Wait up, guys!

28:55.558 --> 28:57.486
I've got a new skirt
with no matching lipstick.

28:57.955 --> 28:59.842
I don't get it.

28:59.843 --> 29:01.721
How could you
not know that he was
coming to visit?

29:01.722 --> 29:02.989
Tory, I told you.

29:02.990 --> 29:04.308
He's from china.

29:04.309 --> 29:05.617
It's not their custom
to call first.

29:05.627 --> 29:07.454
Well, why is he dressed
like that?

29:07.455 --> 29:09.284
He's not going
to hang around you
all the time, is he?

29:09.294 --> 29:11.921
No. Look, can we not
talk about this anymore?

29:11.922 --> 29:12.759
[Beeps]

29:12.760 --> 29:13.859
What does he want?

29:13.860 --> 29:17.286
Uh, hang on.
I've got another call.

29:17.296 --> 29:18.354
Hello?

29:18.355 --> 29:20.402
Hey, I still
don't get it.

29:20.403 --> 29:22.451
How could you
not know you had
a cousin in china?

29:22.461 --> 29:24.987
Oh! Hang on.
Let me three-Way.

29:24.988 --> 29:26.426
[Beeps]

29:26.427 --> 29:27.554
Look, you guys.

29:27.555 --> 29:29.651
My cousin's practically
leaving already.

29:29.652 --> 29:32.888
So, it will probably be better
for the homecoming boat

29:32.889 --> 29:33.957
If we just
kept him a secret.

29:33.958 --> 29:35.388
You know if
Jessica found out,

29:35.389 --> 29:38.553
She'd think of some way
to use it against me.

29:38.554 --> 29:39.522
Totally.

29:39.523 --> 29:40.392
Sure.

But evil is very near.

41:06.786 --> 41:09.294
We must be ready.

41:09.953 --> 41:11.321
[Sighs]

41:14.828 --> 41:16.825
Wendy!

41:16.826 --> 41:18.353
Time for dinner.

41:18.354 --> 41:21.152
In a minute, grandma.

41:22.920 --> 41:26.057
Funny, grandma.

41:27.056 --> 41:31.152
Grandma, do you
ever miss china?

41:31.162 --> 41:34.607
Sometimes.

41:34.608 --> 41:38.055
When I see something
or hear something or
even smell something,

41:38.056 --> 41:43.020
It reminds me
of the village
where I grew up.

41:44.159 --> 41:45.917
Iyangho.

41:45.927 --> 41:48.884
That's pretty.

41:48.894 --> 41:50.451
What's it mean?

41:50.452 --> 41:53.119
Lotus place.

41:53.120 --> 41:55.237
What do you miss most?

41:55.238 --> 41:57.355
Sitting on my
grandfather's lap

41:57.356 --> 42:02.550
On rainy days when
he couldn't go to work
in the fields.

42:02.560 --> 42:06.285
I can still
smell his pipe

42:06.286 --> 42:08.254
And hear his voices

42:08.255 --> 42:09.923
Telling me
1,000-Year-Old stories

42:09.924 --> 42:14.987
About great heroes
and their battles.

42:14.988 --> 42:17.854
My favorite was
about a girl

42:17.855 --> 42:23.189
Who was trained
by a young monk
to fight evil.

42:23.190 --> 42:27.424
Her name
was Miaozhen,

42:27.425 --> 42:30.092
And they say
every 90 years

42:30.093 --> 42:34.887
Her descendents must
accept responsibility

42:34.888 --> 42:37.385
And become
a yin warrior.

42:37.995 --> 42:39.902
Yeah, but grandma,

42:39.903 --> 42:41.821
You don't really
believe that stuff.

42:44.129 --> 42:45.057
Do you?

42:45.058 --> 42:48.484
Of course
I believe it.

42:51.022 --> 42:52.550
You told her?

42:52.560 --> 42:54.357
I didn't have to.

42:54.358 --> 42:56.985
She already knew.

42:56.986 --> 43:02.989
My mother was a yin warrior
and you will be one, too.

43:02.990 --> 43:04.887
It's a great honor.

43:04.888 --> 43:07.075
Grandma.

43:07.076 --> 43:09.253
Hi, everybody.
I'm home.

43:09.853 --> 43:11.990
What smells so...

43:11.991 --> 43:15.018
Oh, hi.

43:15.028 --> 43:17.925
Who's this?

43:20.193 --> 43:23.868
Ma, why didn't you tell us

43:23.869 --> 43:27.555
That your grand nephew
on your second cousin's
father's side was visiting?

43:27.556 --> 43:30.852
I thought I told you

43:30.862 --> 43:32.151
Or I meant to.

43:32.161 --> 43:35.217
I'm just...old.

43:37.026 --> 43:38.584
Dad, can I grow
a ponytail?

43:38.594 --> 43:40.651
No. That's silly

43:40.652 --> 43:43.220
Not that
there's anything
wrong with that.

43:43.221 --> 43:44.387
It's just that...

43:44.388 --> 43:45.556
Look, Shen.

43:45.557 --> 43:46.716
Even though it's
a little bit unannounced,

43:46.726 --> 43:48.085
We want you to feel welcome.

43:48.095 --> 43:50.591
Please stay as long
as you want.

43:50.592 --> 43:53.319
How long do you
think that'll be?

43:53.320 --> 43:55.058
Ow!

43:56.157 --> 43:58.154
Leg cramp.

43:58.155 --> 44:02.389
I think
he has to leave soon.

44:02.390 --> 44:06.017
I mean...
you can't stay long.

44:06.027 --> 44:07.685
Right, Shen?

44:07.695 --> 44:09.472
Oh, yes.

44:09.473 --> 44:11.252
I will be leaving as soon
as I complete my mission.

44:11.262 --> 44:14.987
Your mission?
What's your mission?

44:14.988 --> 44:16.535
Visiting.

44:16.536 --> 44:18.085
He's on a mission
to visit us.

44:18.095 --> 44:20.092
It's a chinese thing.

44:20.093 --> 44:22.389
You wouldn't understand.

44:22.390 --> 44:23.658
Enough talk.

44:23.659 --> 44:25.387
It's very rude
to our guest.

44:25.388 --> 44:29.224
Come on. Eat.

44:30.392 --> 44:32.019
Do you not find the history

44:32.020 --> 44:34.718
Of the terracotta warriors
to be fascinating?

44:34.728 --> 44:36.625
How do you know about that?

44:36.626 --> 44:39.153
Oh, great.
He reads minds, too.

44:39.154 --> 44:41.121
I cannot read minds.

44:41.122 --> 44:45.586
I saw a poster
about your exhibit of the
Qin Dynasty artifacts.

44:45.587 --> 44:47.485
Oh, right.
The posters.

44:47.495 --> 44:49.084
Yeah,
it's really fascinating,

44:49.094 --> 44:52.350
But I'm having
a hard time getting
the research straight.

44:52.360 --> 44:54.357
Perhaps
I could help you.

44:54.358 --> 44:56.326
One of my teachers
at gingi temple

44:56.327 --> 44:59.722
Is a direct descendent
of Qin Shi Huangdi,

44:59.723 --> 45:03.160
The first emperor
of the Qin Dynasty.

45:04.458 --> 45:07.055
Hey.

45:07.056 --> 45:09.653
Does it get cold
under your robe, dude?

45:09.654 --> 45:11.720
Somebody stop him, please.

45:11.721 --> 45:14.018
Shen, I would
be so grateful

45:14.019 --> 45:15.285
If you could
help me understand

45:15.286 --> 45:16.984
The history
of some of the artifacts.

45:16.985 --> 45:18.085
The exhibit is next week,

45:18.095 --> 45:20.450
And I have to get
everything organized.

45:20.451 --> 45:21.721
It would be my honor.

45:21.722 --> 45:23.089
Hey, Shen.

45:23.090 --> 45:25.686
You know any kung fu?

45:25.687 --> 45:28.284
Of course. I have studied it
for a very long time.

45:28.294 --> 45:30.202
Oh.

45:30.203 --> 45:32.109
Do you think you
can show me a couple
of moves?

45:32.110 --> 45:34.017
The football coach
is always on me about
shaking the linebackers.

45:34.018 --> 45:36.456
They're always tagging
me from the side.

45:36.457 --> 45:37.624
Oh, football.

45:37.625 --> 45:40.321
American sport.

45:40.322 --> 45:43.020
I find in defending against
attacks from the side,

45:43.021 --> 45:44.318
One tin chen moves.

45:44.328 --> 45:46.385
What did he say,
grandma?

45:46.386 --> 45:49.053
Shen will explain.

45:49.054 --> 45:51.351
I get
the dessert.

45:52.260 --> 45:54.357
May I demonstrate?

45:54.358 --> 45:56.026
Please.

45:56.027 --> 45:57.685
I believe that
one tin chen in english

45:57.695 --> 46:00.321
Is monkey jumps over wall.

46:00.322 --> 46:02.650
Monkey jumps over wall?

46:02.660 --> 46:06.186
That sounded cooler
in chinese, man.

46:06.187 --> 46:08.324
I agree.

46:09.723 --> 46:11.990
Huh!

46:11.991 --> 46:12.989
Whoa!

46:12.990 --> 46:14.218
Ha ha ha!

46:14.228 --> 46:15.455
Wow! That was great.

46:15.456 --> 46:17.126
Dude, you've got
to teach me that.

46:17.127 --> 46:18.723
Of course.

46:18.724 --> 46:20.192
Oh, my.

46:20.193 --> 46:21.620
Are these mooncakes?

46:21.621 --> 46:23.318
What are mooncakes?

46:23.319 --> 46:25.686
A very special pastry

46:25.687 --> 46:28.055
That is made
to celebrate the chinese
autumn moon festival.

46:28.056 --> 46:30.052
Ooh, when is that?

46:30.053 --> 46:31.890
Soon.

46:31.891 --> 46:33.719
Ma, you haven't made
these since I was a kid.

46:33.720 --> 46:36.556
I didn't make them.

46:39.753 --> 46:40.991
Please.

46:40.992 --> 46:43.090
I hope you enjoy them.

46:45.028 --> 46:48.125
Mmm.
Dude, these are good.

46:48.654 --> 46:51.390
Kenny, aren't you
going to have one?

46:51.391 --> 46:54.388
No.

46:55.158 --> 46:57.455
Excuse me.

47:05.657 --> 47:07.485
Can I have this?

47:07.495 --> 47:09.553
Ow!

47:11.561 --> 47:13.858
But Shen is really sweet.

47:13.859 --> 47:15.717
Tory, nobody cares.

47:15.727 --> 47:17.324
Just because they
see me with him

47:17.325 --> 47:20.452
Doesn't mean they're
not going to vote for me.

47:20.453 --> 47:22.389
I know he's a monk.

47:22.390 --> 47:24.657
Who cares how he dresses?

47:24.658 --> 47:26.825
Look, I've got to go. Bye.

47:26.826 --> 47:29.753
[Sighs]

47:32.390 --> 47:35.556
Mmm.
These are good.

47:35.557 --> 47:38.784
How do you get the
orange off your fingers?

47:38.794 --> 47:40.452
Suck 'em.

47:44.888 --> 47:45.886
Mmm.
Mmm.

47:45.887 --> 47:47.854
They're good, huh?

47:47.855 --> 47:49.702
Oh, hey.

47:49.703 --> 47:51.551
I was practicing
that move. Watch.

47:52.860 --> 47:54.718
Uhh! Uh! Aah!

47:54.728 --> 47:57.455
Are you all right?

47:58.195 --> 48:01.321
Ohh. Oh, yeah.

48:01.921 --> 48:03.919
I meant to do that.

48:12.320 --> 48:15.657
Peter, can you
give me and Jen
a ride to the mall?

48:15.658 --> 48:17.924
Mom said you can
go shopping?

48:17.925 --> 48:19.542
Yeah.

48:19.543 --> 48:21.160
The same way dad
said it was ok

48:21.161 --> 48:22.790
For you to
ditch school and go
surfing last week.

48:23.459 --> 48:25.617
I'll get the car.

48:27.795 --> 48:31.500
How did you do that?

48:31.501 --> 48:35.218
It's an ancient american
move called monkey jumps
for smarter sister.

48:35.787 --> 48:36.925
Come on.

48:36.926 --> 48:39.952
Ok. We've got
an hour till closing.

48:39.953 --> 48:42.889
We've got work to do.

48:42.890 --> 48:44.787
Are we training here?

48:44.788 --> 48:45.856
Sort of.

48:45.857 --> 48:47.824
Come on.

50:02.121 --> 50:04.918
I thought you
were too full.

50:04.928 --> 50:08.325
This mooncake
is so good.

50:09.723 --> 50:11.920
I think I owe Shen
an apology.

50:11.921 --> 50:15.287
I didn't mean
to be rude to him.

50:15.288 --> 50:18.285
It's just when I
saw these mooncakes,

50:18.295 --> 50:20.651
It was like
I was a boy again

50:20.652 --> 50:26.317
And then I felt guilty
that I grew up turning
my back on all of this.

50:26.986 --> 50:28.754
I don't want
to do that anymore.

50:28.755 --> 50:31.620
You didn't do it alone.

50:31.621 --> 50:35.987
I want us to be a
Chinese-American family.

50:37.755 --> 50:39.084
Can I have a bite?

50:39.094 --> 50:40.092
No.

50:40.093 --> 50:42.321
Hey.

50:44.219 --> 50:46.186
It's so strange.

50:46.187 --> 50:47.355
In one night,

50:47.356 --> 50:50.651
This long lost relative
comes into our lives

50:50.652 --> 50:53.288
And in one evening
he gives your mother

50:53.289 --> 50:55.058
A little piece
of the country...

50:55.059 --> 50:56.017
Mm-Hmm.

50:56.027 --> 50:58.054
Gives Peter
a football move,

50:58.055 --> 51:00.093
Finds some missing pieces
in your work,

51:00.094 --> 51:04.119
And opens my eyes
to something we've
been missing.

51:04.788 --> 51:07.025
It's wonderful, isn't it?

51:07.026 --> 51:08.185
Yeah.

51:08.195 --> 51:10.651
It's just a little sad

51:10.652 --> 51:13.120
Because I don't think
Wendy will get anything
out of this.

51:13.121 --> 51:14.188
Mmm.

51:14.189 --> 51:15.107
[Bell rings]

51:15.108 --> 51:16.017
Well, are you gonna come?

51:16.027 --> 51:17.783
Um, well, I'll see you
guys later.

51:17.784 --> 51:18.822
I'm gonna miss it, ok?

51:18.823 --> 51:20.253
all right.
Hey, babe.

51:20.254 --> 51:22.090
Oh. Hi!

51:22.091 --> 51:23.888
What do you think?

51:23.889 --> 51:26.156
Uh...your shirt.

51:26.157 --> 51:27.285
It looks nice.

51:27.286 --> 51:29.053
No.

51:29.054 --> 51:30.651
My hair.

51:30.652 --> 51:32.120
It looks the same.

51:32.121 --> 51:34.058
I got highlights. See?

51:34.059 --> 51:35.787
I figure when
we win homecoming,

51:35.788 --> 51:38.884
The stage lights will
really bring them out.

51:38.894 --> 51:41.051
Yeah. Great.

51:41.052 --> 51:42.351
What are you looking for?

51:42.361 --> 51:43.718
Oh, nobody.

51:43.719 --> 51:46.157
I just thought maybe
Shen would be around.

51:46.158 --> 51:47.285
Who?

51:47.286 --> 51:49.084
My cousin.

51:49.094 --> 51:50.991
Oh, yeah.

51:50.992 --> 51:52.888
You know, you got
to stay away from him.

51:52.889 --> 51:54.616
He's gonna wreck it for us.

51:54.617 --> 51:56.055
People are starting to talk.

51:56.056 --> 51:58.654
Well, people should mind
their own business.

51:58.655 --> 52:01.021
Maybe he's a nice guy.

52:01.022 --> 52:02.090
Nice guy.

52:02.091 --> 52:04.358

01:19:05.917 --> 01:19:08.873
Shen, you all right?

01:19:08.874 --> 01:19:11.821
Not too crazy
about the pain,
but I will be ok.

01:19:11.822 --> 01:19:14.388
Witness...

01:19:14.389 --> 01:19:16.956
Yin warrior,
the darkness of a new day.

01:19:16.957 --> 01:19:19.623
That doesn't sound
like Jessica.

01:19:19.624 --> 01:19:22.869
It's Yan-Lo.

01:19:22.870 --> 01:19:26.117
I knew this weak
yin warrior would come
to the aid of her monk.

01:19:26.118 --> 01:19:27.884
Well, yeah.

01:19:27.885 --> 01:19:29.952
And to save the world.

01:19:29.953 --> 01:19:30.782
Right.

01:19:30.792 --> 01:19:32.221
And to save the world.

01:19:32.222 --> 01:19:34.188
Attack!

01:19:34.189 --> 01:19:35.917
[Yelling]

01:19:36.926 --> 01:19:39.084
Aah! Yah!

01:19:39.853 --> 01:19:41.582
Hah!

01:19:41.991 --> 01:19:43.989
Hah! Hah!

01:19:45.088 --> 01:19:46.786
Hah!

01:19:46.986 --> 01:19:49.852
Maybe you guys
want to jump in now?

01:19:49.853 --> 01:19:52.920
[Yelling]

01:19:54.888 --> 01:19:55.916
Ah!
Ah!

01:19:55.917 --> 01:19:59.684
[Yelling and grunting]

01:20:56.686 --> 01:20:57.865
Grandma?

01:20:57.875 --> 01:20:59.054
What are you doing here?

01:20:59.055 --> 01:21:02.220
I knew you would make
the right choice.

01:21:02.221 --> 01:21:05.716
Put on your
great grandmother's robe

01:21:05.717 --> 01:21:09.154
And save the world.

01:21:20.692 --> 01:21:21.720
Huh!
[Growls]

01:21:21.721 --> 01:21:24.149
[Growling
and grunting]

01:21:27.755 --> 01:21:29.483
Aah!

01:21:29.484 --> 01:21:31.881
Aah! Aah!

01:21:31.891 --> 01:21:33.249
Aah!

01:21:33.250 --> 01:21:36.056
Aah!

01:21:36.057 --> 01:21:40.253
[Grunting
and yelling]

01:22:28.924 --> 01:22:31.681
Oh-Hoo!

01:22:37.526 --> 01:22:40.053
[Grunting
and growling]

01:23:47.086 --> 01:23:48.953
Where am I?

01:23:48.954 --> 01:23:50.322
Wendy?

01:23:50.323 --> 01:23:51.551
Hey, Jessica.

01:23:51.552 --> 01:23:54.118
You're kind of
at the museum.

01:23:54.119 --> 01:23:55.087
Why?

01:23:55.088 --> 01:23:56.156
I don't know.

01:23:56.157 --> 01:23:57.955
You're supposed
to be at homecoming.

01:23:57.956 --> 01:23:59.353
You're late.

01:23:59.354 --> 01:24:02.070
I am?

01:24:02.071 --> 01:24:04.788
I mean...I thought
everyone already
voted you queen.

01:24:04.789 --> 01:24:07.985
I've been thinking lately.

01:24:08.485 --> 01:24:12.989
There are things
that are more important
to me right now.

01:24:12.990 --> 01:24:15.388
You better hurry if you're
going to get that crown.

01:24:15.389 --> 01:24:19.024
Uh...yeah.

01:24:22.920 --> 01:24:24.449
Thanks.

01:24:33.020 --> 01:24:36.985
I am so proud of you.

01:24:36.986 --> 01:24:39.123
Oh, grandma.

01:24:39.124 --> 01:24:41.282
Let's go home.

01:24:41.292 --> 01:24:43.520
Mooncakes on me.

01:24:48.055 --> 01:24:50.023
I don't think
this is over yet.

01:24:50.024 --> 01:24:54.988
I was wondering why
I survived this time.

01:24:58.325 --> 01:25:01.422
[Growling]

01:25:07.955 --> 01:25:11.052
[Yelling]

01:25:21.652 --> 01:25:25.117
Uh, Shen,
any advice here?

01:25:25.118 --> 01:25:27.616
I don't know.

01:25:27.626 --> 01:25:30.123
This is the first time
Yan-Lo has shown up
in person.

01:25:30.124 --> 01:25:31.021
Ok.

01:25:31.022 --> 01:25:33.019
That's not
going to help me.

01:25:33.020 --> 01:25:35.287
[Growling]

01:25:35.288 --> 01:25:37.256
[Yelling]

01:25:57.486 --> 01:25:59.283
Let him go!

01:25:59.284 --> 01:26:01.682
[Growling]

01:26:01.692 --> 01:26:03.049
It's destiny.

01:26:03.050 --> 01:26:04.388
You must let me go.

01:26:04.389 --> 01:26:09.383
No! Grandma,
I'm losing Shen!
What do I do?

01:26:09.384 --> 01:26:12.321
Everything you have learned!

01:26:13.020 --> 01:26:14.418
Let him go!

01:26:14.419 --> 01:26:16.487
[Grunts]

01:26:29.953 --> 01:26:31.382
Aah!

01:26:31.392 --> 01:26:36.457
[Growls]

01:26:44.918 --> 01:26:46.016
Shen!

01:26:46.017 --> 01:26:47.116
Shen!

01:26:47.126 --> 01:26:48.384
At last.

01:26:48.385 --> 01:26:51.920
The days of doom
become destiny.

01:26:51.921 --> 01:26:54.188
No. I won't
let Shen die.

01:26:54.189 --> 01:26:56.956
This is not destiny.

01:27:04.888 --> 01:27:07.086
[Heart beating]

01:27:10.623 --> 01:27:11.651
Am I alive?

01:27:11.652 --> 01:27:13.319
You're alive.

01:27:13.320 --> 01:27:14.918
[Growling]

01:27:23.350 --> 01:27:24.988
Aah!

01:27:27.016 --> 01:27:29.124
[Growling]

01:27:31.991 --> 01:27:35.518
Yaaah!
Yaaah!

01:27:36.157 --> 01:27:39.053
[Growling]

01:27:39.054 --> 01:27:41.151
Yaaah!
Yaaah!

01:27:41.152 --> 01:27:44.619
[Growls]

01:27:59.384 --> 01:28:01.981
You changed the destiny.

01:28:01.991 --> 01:28:03.089
I know.

01:28:03.090 --> 01:28:04.349
Are you mad?

01:28:04.359 --> 01:28:05.487
No.

01:28:05.488 --> 01:28:06.616
But the monks might be.

01:28:06.617 --> 01:28:12.181
Yan-Lo has been
destroyed forever.

01:28:12.191 --> 01:28:14.987
The legend is over.

01:28:14.988 --> 01:28:15.916
How?

01:28:15.917 --> 01:28:17.254
By something mightier

01:28:17.255 --> 01:28:20.153
Than anything we could ever
teach a yin warrior.

01:28:20.154 --> 01:28:22.450
True sacrifice...

01:28:22.451 --> 01:28:24.648
To the world...

01:28:24.658 --> 01:28:27.016
And a friend.

01:28:28.325 --> 01:28:30.982
Our purpose
is finished as well.

01:28:30.992 --> 01:28:31.881
What about me?

01:28:31.891 --> 01:28:34.887
This will be
your last life.

01:28:34.888 --> 01:28:36.386
Live it well.

01:28:36.387 --> 01:28:38.455
He can stay?

01:28:39.154 --> 01:28:41.152
I can stay?

01:28:53.090 --> 01:28:56.457
Hey, you two.
Break it up.

01:28:57.256 --> 01:28:59.632
Where are we?

01:28:59.633 --> 01:29:02.021
We're all on the way
to my place for mooncakes.

01:29:02.022 --> 01:29:04.687
You're all invited.

01:29:04.688 --> 01:29:07.156
Come along now.

01:29:15.158 --> 01:29:17.915
You know, I really
hate those mooncakes.

01:29:17.925 --> 01:29:20.652
I've been eating them
for 1,000 years.

01:29:21.422 --> 01:29:23.919
Let's get a cappuccino.

01:29:24.219 --> 01:29:26.616
Let's go this way.
