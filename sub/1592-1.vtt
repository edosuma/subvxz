38:30.909 --> 38:33.476
I never said you did.

38:33.478 --> 38:36.513
I could come to you
if you'd prefer.

38:36.515 --> 38:38.648
I'LL BE THERE
IN A HALF-HOUR.

38:41.520 --> 38:43.453
[ GLASS CLINKS ]

39:16.755 --> 39:18.588
[ SOBBING ]

39:18.590 --> 39:19.923
[ GLASS THUDS ]

39:42.547 --> 39:45.415
HI, MR. CRAWFORD.

39:45.417 --> 39:47.050
HAVE A SEAT.

39:57.929 --> 40:00.930
IT'S A TERRIBLE JOB,
THIS.

40:02.401 --> 40:04.100
I'VE SEEN
SOME HORRIFIC THINGS.

40:05.537 --> 40:08.138
CHILDREN'S CASES
ARE THE WORST --

40:08.140 --> 40:13.943
SMOTHERED CHILDREN, BURNED,
CHILDREN THROWN FROM BRIDGES,

40:13.945 --> 40:18.615
BEATEN 'CAUSE THEY
LOOKED LIKE THEIR MOM

40:18.617 --> 40:22.085
OR DROWNED
SO THAT DADDY CAN'T HAVE THEM

40:22.087 --> 40:27.090
OR KILLED
JUST FOR BEING AROUND

40:27.092 --> 40:30.493
WHEN THE WORLD GOT BAD
FOR SOMEONE.

40:30.495 --> 40:33.897
USUALLY, IT'S EASY TO DETERMINE
WHO DID IT AND WHY --

40:33.899 --> 40:37.967
A HISTORY OF DEPRESSION,
ADDICTION, ABUSE.

40:37.969 --> 40:40.970
BUT SOMETIMES
ACCIDENTS HAPPEN...

40:42.741 --> 40:44.874
...A MISTAKE.

40:44.876 --> 40:49.779
AND THE PERSON
WHO MAKES THE MISTAKE,

40:49.781 --> 40:52.081
THEY DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

40:52.083 --> 40:54.150
THEY DON'T KNOW
HOW TO TELL THE TRUTH,

40:54.152 --> 40:57.954
THAT IT'S NOT TOO LATE
TO TELL THE TRUTH.

40:57.956 --> 41:01.991
'CAUSE THE TRUTH
COMES OUT.

41:01.993 --> 41:04.994
IT COULD TAKE AN HOUR...

41:04.996 --> 41:07.464
OR IT COULD TAKE 10 YEARS.

41:08.934 --> 41:10.667
WE DON'T STOP.

41:10.669 --> 41:12.569
<i> I</i> DON'T STOP.

41:15.507 --> 41:19.709
SO I WANTED
TO GIVE YOU THE CHANCE

41:19.711 --> 41:22.111
TO TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED.

41:25.817 --> 41:28.952
I DIDN'T KILL TOM.

41:28.954 --> 41:32.021
I HAD NO REASON
TO KILL TOM.

41:34.559 --> 41:38.561
HOW MANY TIMES DID YOU
SLEEP WITH JESS MURPHY?

41:39.564 --> 41:42.866
'CAUSE I KNOW
OF AT LEAST ONE.

41:43.969 --> 41:48.738
AND I CAN ESTIMATE
FAIRLY ACCURATELY WHEN THAT WAS.

41:48.740 --> 41:51.074
SEE, THE DNA SAMPLE
THAT YOU GAVE US,

41:51.076 --> 41:53.643
WE TESTED IT
AGAINST TOM'S,

41:53.645 --> 42:00.550
AND THE PROBABILITY OF PATERNITY
IS 99.9%.

42:00.552 --> 42:03.186
MR. CRAWFORD...

42:03.188 --> 42:06.723
YOU DID KNOW
THAT TOM WAS YOUR SON?
