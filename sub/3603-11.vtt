Previously on Heroes.

00:04.046 --> 00:06.002
Tell me where
I can find the virus
so I can stop it.

Wait!

00:15.391 --> 00:18.053
MR. BENNET: Iwas there
when your father
first brought you in.

00:18.144 --> 00:19.554
And then they started
the testing.

00:19.645 --> 00:21.681
My father would never
let that happen.

00:21.772 --> 00:23.603
We need to be heroes.
Like Dad.

00:23.691 --> 00:25.647
Being a hero is
what got your father killed.

00:25.735 --> 00:27.020
You're gonna help me
get back my dad's medal?

00:27.111 --> 00:29.227
Long as you stay
out of the way.

00:29.322 --> 00:32.029
Anything crazy happens,
/ need you safe.

00:32.116 --> 00:33.697

SYLAR: / just
want to help you.

00:44.295 --> 00:46.832

You have done that.
And so much more.

00:49.425 --> 00:50.710
MR. BENNET: Why am / not dead?

00:50.801 --> 00:51.756
MOHINDER: You would have been,

00:51.844 --> 00:53.505
if not for an infusion
of your daughter's blood.

00:53.596 --> 00:56.463
Your recovery has proven
this blood has tremendous
regenerative properties.

00:56.807 --> 00:59.264
Kidnapped me
and murdered
my father.

00:59.644 --> 01:01.555
I'll show everyone
exactly what I can do.

01:01.646 --> 01:05.059
Once the secret's out,
you won't be able
to touch me or my family.

the cure, Niki.

01:12.823 --> 01:13.983
I'll bring it to you
on the next flight.

SYLAR ON PHONE:
Hello, Mohinder.
Sylar?

01:15.701 --> 01:18.363
I convinced the babysitter
to take the night off.

01:33.886 --> 01:37.504
Welcome home, Dr. Suresh.
What happened to your nose?

01:38.474 --> 01:40.465
Where's Molly?
Asleep.

01:40.559 --> 01:43.687
Keep your voice down.
We don't want to wake her.

01:43.771 --> 01:45.511
What is it you want?

01:46.148 --> 01:47.854
(CLOCKS TICKING)

01:51.612 --> 01:53.068
Breakfast.

01:54.699 --> 01:56.906
Hope you don't mind.
Maya cooked.

01:56.993 --> 02:00.201
She makes the most
amazing chilaquiles.

02:02.957 --> 02:04.788
It's such an honor
to meet you.

02:04.875 --> 02:06.035
He's the one that
should be honored.

02:06.127 --> 02:08.994
Maya came all the way
from South America
just to be here, Mohinder.

02:09.088 --> 02:11.295
Really? Why is that?

02:12.216 --> 02:14.047
| read your father's book.

02:14.135 --> 02:19.300
It had so many answers,
but I have so many
more questions.

02:19.390 --> 02:21.381
Sit. Eat.

02:22.268 --> 02:23.849
l'm starving.

02:25.229 --> 02:28.187
When Gabriel told me
you two knew each other,

02:28.816 --> 02:31.148
I knew fate
brought us together.

02:31.319 --> 02:32.559
MOHINDER: Gabriel?

02:32.862 --> 02:36.605
You mean Sylar, don't you?
You do know this man
is a killer.

02:37.533 --> 02:38.613
Yes.

02:39.577 --> 02:40.987
He told me.

02:43.664 --> 02:45.040
He did?

02:46.667 --> 02:50.580
And I'm ashamed to admit that
l have taken lives as well.

02:52.256 --> 02:56.499
l have a sickness
that comes out of me.
It poisons everyone around.

02:57.720 --> 02:59.927
I need your help, Dr. Suresh.

03:00.556 --> 03:01.841
So that's what
this is about?

03:01.932 --> 03:03.843
We both need
your help.

03:03.934 --> 03:04.889
Why's that?

03:04.977 --> 03:07.354
l was reading
about your lab work
on the laptop.

03:07.438 --> 03:09.099
The Shanti virus.

03:09.940 --> 03:12.977
Does it really take away
a person's abilities?

03:13.361 --> 03:16.694
It also has the unfortunate
side effect of killing
the person infected.

03:16.781 --> 03:20.524
Is that why
your powers are gone?
That you have this virus?

03:32.088 --> 03:33.373
Gabriel?

03:34.090 --> 03:35.705
What are you doing?

03:35.800 --> 03:37.461
Maya, I need you
to stay calm.

03:37.551 --> 03:40.543
Apparently, Mohinder,
your blood is
the answer to my ills.

03:40.638 --> 03:41.923
No. No, not always.

03:42.014 --> 03:45.347
Trust me,
there are many different
strains of the virus.

03:45.434 --> 03:48.176
But when you mix it with
a certain cheerleader's blood,

03:48.270 --> 03:52.764
it changes, doesn't it?
And it heals anything,
isn't that right, Doctor?

03:54.902 --> 03:56.483
You lied to me?

04:00.324 --> 04:02.736
I don't know
what he told you,
but he's not my friend.

04:02.827 --> 04:03.816
He's a monster.

04:03.911 --> 04:04.946
SYLAR: Maya,

04:05.037 --> 04:06.698
do not spoil this.

04:07.289 --> 04:08.825
(BREATHING RAPIDLY)

04:12.336 --> 04:16.295

04:29.145 --> 04:31.602
Stop it, Maya. Now!

04:44.702 --> 04:46.033
(CRYING)

04:46.579 --> 04:47.910
All right.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.658
I'll help you,
but not here.

04:52.251 --> 04:54.287
We need to get to my lab.

04:55.796 --> 04:58.754
Lead the way, Doctor.

05:05.347 --> 05:08.134
ANGELA: I suppose I have you
to thank for my early
release from jail.

05:08.225 --> 05:10.011
You didn't
kill anyone, Mom.

05:10.102 --> 05:12.058
MATT: But Adam Monroe did.
Again.

05:12.897 --> 05:14.478
Victoria Pratt is dead.

05:14.565 --> 05:16.647
I found her body
at her place in Maine.

05:16.734 --> 05:18.975
Adam signed it
with one of these.

05:21.655 --> 05:23.771
Where's Adam going next?

05:23.866 --> 05:25.822
How long are we going
to suffer for your sins?

05:25.910 --> 05:28.026
For your generation's deeds?

05:29.955 --> 05:33.573
Adam wanted revenge
on those of us
who betrayed him.

05:33.667 --> 05:36.454
It's done now.
Let it go, Nathan.

05:37.129 --> 05:38.164
It's over.

05:38.255 --> 05:39.631
Peter's alive...

05:41.175 --> 05:42.381
Mom.

05:43.344 --> 05:44.584
MATT: And he's
working with Adam.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.214
They both killed
Victoria Pratt.

05:46.305 --> 05:49.468
Their fingerprints are
all over the murder scene.

05:58.901 --> 06:00.812
It all went so wrong.

06:02.154 --> 06:03.815
Thirty years ago,

06:05.282 --> 06:09.195
a group of us came together
to change the world.
To fix it.

06:10.120 --> 06:11.451
And Adam

06:12.373 --> 06:15.365
had a perspective
on history
that was compelling,

06:15.459 --> 06:17.324
and we believed in him.

06:17.628 --> 06:18.788
Idid.

06:19.630 --> 06:21.086
Linderman. Your father.

06:21.173 --> 06:23.129
Bob said you locked him away.

06:23.217 --> 06:24.297
No.

06:25.135 --> 06:26.636
Not at first.

06:27.304 --> 06:29.556
In the beginning,
I helped him.

06:30.099 --> 06:31.430
You what?

06:31.976 --> 06:35.059
And in the end,
Adam decided that the world
just wasn't worth fixing

06:35.145 --> 06:39.104
and that it needed
to be wiped clean
with an unstoppable virus.

06:40.150 --> 06:42.937
And just before
it was too late, I...

06:45.322 --> 06:47.483
I came to realize
how wrong it was.

06:47.575 --> 06:48.690
Did you?

06:48.826 --> 06:51.738
You and Linderman
wanted to blow up
New York to save the world.

06:53.205 --> 06:56.663
Doesn't sound to me
like you've changed
much at all, Ma.

06:59.253 --> 07:02.871
Only someone with
Peter's abilities could get
to where the virus is stored.

07:02.965 --> 07:04.250
That's why Adam chose him.

07:04.341 --> 07:05.717
Where would that be,
Mrs. Petrelli?

07:05.801 --> 07:07.132

07:44.423 --> 07:46.584
This doesn't look
like the sort of place
where they'd store a virus

07:46.675 --> 07:48.006
that could
destroy the world.

07:48.093 --> 07:49.799

Peter Petrelli?

08:11.450 --> 08:12.530
What are you doing here?

08:12.618 --> 08:16.110
Adam Monroe killed my father.
And for that he must pay.

08:18.040 --> 08:19.246
No!

08:23.796 --> 08:25.832
I can't let you hurt him.

Adam is my friend.

08:36.767 --> 08:39.600
He was my friend, too,
400 years ago.

08:40.604 --> 08:42.105
He betrayed me.

08:42.439 --> 08:44.145
He will betray you.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.018
No!

08:47.945 --> 08:49.401
He saved
my brother's life.

08:49.488 --> 08:51.274
He murdered
my father.

08:51.365 --> 08:54.448
Your father had him
locked away for 30 years.

08:54.535 --> 08:57.026
I know.
I was in that same prison.

Said he knew you.

09:34.366 --> 09:36.072
We were friends once.

09:36.577 --> 09:38.442
A very long time ago.

09:38.537 --> 09:40.493
He tried to kill you.

09:40.789 --> 09:42.074
Said I shouldn't trust you.

09:42.166 --> 09:44.532
And what did you
think about that?

09:45.169 --> 09:46.579
Let's go destroy the virus.

09:46.670 --> 09:47.955
Right.

09:50.841 --> 09:53.048
I believe this is mine, Carp.

10:10.360 --> 10:14.524
Dad left records
of pretty much everything
he did for the Company.

10:15.449 --> 10:17.986
You're really going
through with this?

10:18.076 --> 10:20.112
They killed Dad.
They're never going
to leave us alone.

10:20.204 --> 10:24.698
You do realize what will
happen to us if you tell
everyone what you can do?

10:25.459 --> 10:26.574
Yes.

No more running.
No more hiding.
No more secrets.

Your father couldn't take down
this Company, Claire.

10:33.467 --> 10:35.708

10:37.596 --> 10:40.133
I don't know
if you can understand it.

10:40.599 --> 10:43.341
They only target people
with abilities.

You're still my daughter,

done by provoking Claire?

11:31.733 --> 11:33.348
Who knew she'd turn
whistle-blower?

11:33.443 --> 11:36.310
It's totally unprofessional,
not to mention petty.

11:36.405 --> 11:38.942
And Claire's not even
in your league.

11:39.032 --> 11:41.444
She isn't working
with a gunshot wound.

you have performed
well below what you can do.

all about my ability.

I'm stuck in this hellhole.
My family thinks I'm dead.

12:34.421 --> 12:37.083
There's not a lot
of incentive to share.

12:42.012 --> 12:44.003
I could make you tell me.

12:44.306 --> 12:45.796
You could try.

12:52.064 --> 12:53.270
Please.

12:56.109 --> 12:58.691
I don't have anyone else
to talk to.

13:00.030 --> 13:03.522
They wanted to see
how much wattage
you could discharge.

13:03.742 --> 13:08.486
Enough to power a flashlight?
A street lamp?
An entire city block?

13:09.373 --> 13:12.365
During testing,
you'd pass out
from the strain.

tougher than that."

You know, the hardest thing
a parent ever does

is to have to see
their child in pain.

13:41.571 --> 13:42.902
Leaving.

13:49.913 --> 13:52.450
Noah, we have a problem.

13:52.541 --> 13:55.374
I'm not part of your "we."
Do you remember?

13:56.545 --> 13:58.331
This is about Claire.

13:59.923 --> 14:01.914
She's becoming difficult.

14:03.802 --> 14:05.042
Is she?

14:06.555 --> 14:09.843
I need to know
if she could possibly
have any hard evidence

14:09.933 --> 14:12.595
which could leave
this Company exposed.

14:21.153 --> 14:22.484
That's unfortunate.

14:22.571 --> 14:27.156
Because now we're going
to have to take measures
to keep your daughter quiet.

14:33.457 --> 14:35.243
MICAH: Mom!
Micah!

14:35.333 --> 14:37.870
Oh, God. Where have you been?
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

14:37.961 --> 14:41.624
Monica tried to get my stuff
back that was stolen.
Dad's medal. My comics.

14:41.715 --> 14:43.671
I told you to
let the police handle it.

14:43.759 --> 14:45.340
She got caught.

14:45.469 --> 14:46.584
I'm calling the police.

14:46.678 --> 14:48.589
You can call them
after we find her.

14:48.680 --> 14:51.422
She was taken in a red van.
We have to rescue her.

14:51.516 --> 14:54.098
With your super strength...
Micah, stop.

14:54.186 --> 14:56.393
I don't have my strength
anymore.

14:56.480 --> 14:57.515
What?

14:57.606 --> 14:59.813
The virus.
It has side effects.

15:00.317 --> 15:04.481
But it's okay.
I got a call from Dr. Suresh.
He maybe found a cure.

15:04.571 --> 15:07.187
He's on his way here
to make me better.

15:07.491 --> 15:08.822
I hope so.

15:10.494 --> 15:12.450
But right now,
Monica needs my help.

15:12.537 --> 15:14.823
So all you have
to do is drive.

15:20.670 --> 15:22.046
(GRUNTING)

15:23.840 --> 15:25.876
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Warning! Security breach!

15:25.967 --> 15:28.174
Unauthorized personnel
in the area.

15:28.345 --> 15:29.755

15:29.846 --> 15:31.461
(ALARM SOUNDING)

15:34.267 --> 15:36.303
lbeHeve
it's up to the left.

15:36.394 --> 15:38.646
Oh, please.
It's been 30 years.

15:39.147 --> 15:42.514
Warning! Security breach!
Unauthorized personnel...

15:42.609 --> 15:44.520
Take care of that,
will you?

15:57.833 --> 15:59.664
So what do we do now?

15:59.751 --> 16:03.414
I guess you'll have
to pry it open
with that brain of yours.

16:03.672 --> 16:04.787
(SCOFFS)

16:04.881 --> 16:07.338
I'm not sure
I have that sort of power.

16:07.425 --> 16:11.464
There's not much
at stake here. Just the fate
of the entire human race.

16:14.015 --> 16:16.097
Did you kill
Hiro's father?

16:17.394 --> 16:18.725
Idid.

16:19.437 --> 16:21.644
He saw to it that the virus
be safely kept here.

16:21.731 --> 16:24.473
If he didn't plan to use it,
why not destroy it?

16:24.568 --> 16:28.060
Why don't you make me
believe you, Adam?
Hiro said not to trust...

16:28.155 --> 16:31.147
The woman you love
is trapped in some
horrible future

16:31.241 --> 16:33.277
where nearly
everyone's dead.

16:33.368 --> 16:35.154
You can change that.

16:35.912 --> 16:37.743
She needs you, Peter.

16:39.666 --> 16:42.282
We all need you
to open that door.

17:14.451 --> 17:18.660
You are nothing like you said
you were. Alejandro was right
about you all along.

17:18.747 --> 17:21.830
You want to get rid
of your powers.
I want mine back.

17:21.917 --> 17:25.751
After Suresh fixes me,
I'll gladly take yours
off your hands.

17:28.298 --> 17:30.334
There's a bed over there.

17:31.009 --> 17:34.376
Stay put,
stay calm
and remember...

17:35.472 --> 17:36.552
Mohinder?

17:36.640 --> 17:38.972
It'll be okay, Molly.
I promise.

17:40.227 --> 17:43.594
So this is your
laboratory, huh?

17:43.688 --> 17:44.894
(CHUCKUNG)

17:44.981 --> 17:48.644
I killed that artist,
Isaac Mendez,
right on this very spot.

17:53.907 --> 17:55.772
I need to have to take
a sample of your blood.

17:55.867 --> 17:57.027
VVhy?

17:57.118 --> 17:58.494
You self-diagnosed.

17:58.578 --> 18:00.910
I need to know what strain
of the virus you have.

18:00.997 --> 18:01.986
Or if you even
have it at all.

18:02.082 --> 18:03.242
Just give me the remedy.

18:03.333 --> 18:06.917
It doesn't work like that.
The wrong dosage
would kill you.

18:11.508 --> 18:12.839
(EXHALES)

18:18.932 --> 18:21.924
Your father helped me
find my gift, and now here
you are restoring it.

18:22.018 --> 18:23.929
Life has its poetry,
doesn't it?

18:24.020 --> 18:25.305
My father who you murdered.

18:25.397 --> 18:27.513
Your father who betrayed me.

18:28.692 --> 18:30.603
Don't make that same mistake,
Mohinder.

18:30.694 --> 18:31.683
Ouch!

19:11.401 --> 19:12.390
Huh.

19:12.485 --> 19:16.103
Does Suresh know you have him
on video surveillance?

19:24.080 --> 19:25.365
Sylar.

19:29.252 --> 19:31.959
Oh, Daddy,
you're gonna be
so proud of me.

19:44.017 --> 19:45.006
Where am |?

19:45.101 --> 19:46.216
MAN: That doesn't matter.

19:46.311 --> 19:49.018
Both you and it
are about to get
country fried.

19:49.105 --> 19:50.311
Please! Let me go!

19:50.398 --> 19:52.810
I swear, I was only
trying to help somebody.

19:52.901 --> 19:53.936
You should have
thought about that

19:54.027 --> 19:56.234
before you started
messing up my business.

19:56.321 --> 19:59.154
So you thought
you was gonna
be a hero, huh?

19:59.783 --> 20:02.069
You know what happens
to heroes in the real world?

20:02.160 --> 20:04.902
They end up dead,
just like you.

20:13.296 --> 20:14.832
Turn left here.

20:16.758 --> 20:18.544
Explain to me
how that works.

20:18.635 --> 20:19.875
Monica has a cell phone.

20:19.969 --> 20:24.963
And the battery emits a tiny
GPS signal which I can use
to triangulate her position.

20:25.308 --> 20:29.017
Basically, I told your
cell phone to find her cell
phone and show me where it is.

20:29.104 --> 20:30.810
You told the phone?

20:31.481 --> 20:32.641
Yeah.

20:34.150 --> 20:36.937
Don't slow down.
The light will change.

20:42.659 --> 20:44.866
Let me guess.
You told it to?

20:50.625 --> 20:53.537
MATT: Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Slow down, slow down,
slow down!

20:53.628 --> 20:55.164
(BOTH GRUNTING)

20:57.841 --> 21:01.333
Okay. We don't talk
about that ever again.

21:01.428 --> 21:02.668
Agreed.

21:03.638 --> 21:06.926
Look, before we go in,
I need to know something.

21:07.016 --> 21:09.348
ls Peter as dangerous
as he was in Kirby Plaza?

21:09.436 --> 21:10.972
You know, with the whole...

21:11.062 --> 21:13.599
I haven't seen him since
that night, but I trust him
with my life, Parkman.

21:13.690 --> 21:15.601
Yeah. But your mother...

21:15.984 --> 21:20.068
Your mother told me
that if I had to,
that I should kill Peter.

21:21.948 --> 21:24.109
Listening to my mother
has never led
to anything good.

21:24.200 --> 21:27.112
If Peter becomes a problem,
l'll handle him.

21:27.537 --> 21:28.947
Flying Man!

21:31.624 --> 21:33.956
Who is this guy
supposed to be?

21:42.719 --> 21:44.175
Oh, good, you're here.

21:44.262 --> 21:47.004
So these two boxes are done.
They can go in the car.

21:47.098 --> 21:49.555
I didn't come to help you,
Claire.

21:50.101 --> 21:51.841
I came to stop you.

21:54.230 --> 21:56.391
These people ruined my life.

21:56.941 --> 21:57.976
Your life.

21:58.067 --> 21:59.568
No. They didn't.

22:00.528 --> 22:03.315
But what you're about to do,
I'm pretty sure that will.

22:03.406 --> 22:06.318
West, you were the one
who said that
we were special.

22:06.409 --> 22:08.400
That the rules
didn't apply to us.

22:08.495 --> 22:09.985
I think
you misunderstood me.

22:10.079 --> 22:13.162
If we show everyone
what we can do,
they'll listen to us.

22:13.249 --> 22:14.500
I can't.

22:15.043 --> 22:16.704
I like my secrets,

22:17.462 --> 22:19.498
and I liked finding in you

22:19.589 --> 22:22.080
someone who I could
share that with.

22:22.342 --> 22:24.879
But after you go public,
it's all gone.

22:24.969 --> 22:27.426
You saw what they did
to my dad.

22:28.348 --> 22:30.885
This is the only way
to beat them.

22:31.100 --> 22:34.228
Exposing us isn't going
to bring him back.

22:36.940 --> 22:38.146
Fine.

22:40.193 --> 22:43.401
Here's your file.
It's everything
they have on you.

22:43.947 --> 22:46.029
Now there isn't an "us"
for you to be worried about.

22:46.115 --> 22:48.322
Claire, please.
Don't do this.

23:09.931 --> 23:11.717

23:39.502 --> 23:41.743
I wish Alejandro
was here to help.

23:41.838 --> 23:42.918
Who's that?

23:43.006 --> 23:44.621
He's my brother.

23:45.383 --> 23:47.089
I sent him away.

23:48.011 --> 23:49.592
Gabriel said...

23:52.348 --> 23:55.681
I can find him for you,
even if he's far away,

23:57.228 --> 23:58.764
so you'll know
he's safe.

23:58.855 --> 24:00.095
You can?

24:00.690 --> 24:01.850
How?

24:02.609 --> 24:04.725
| just know
where people are.

24:05.737 --> 24:08.695
I need a picture
or something
to think about.

24:11.492 --> 24:13.153
This is Alejandro.

24:14.996 --> 24:16.202
Here.

24:34.390 --> 24:36.096
He's not anywhere.

24:37.310 --> 24:40.222
But if he's not anywhere...

24:43.775 --> 24:45.060
(SOBS)

24:51.616 --> 24:52.776
How...

24:53.368 --> 24:56.451
You have the same strain
of the virus Niki has.

24:57.163 --> 24:59.575
The Company injected you
as well.

24:59.666 --> 25:01.076
Injected me?

25:01.417 --> 25:02.998
Someone did this to me?

25:03.086 --> 25:04.576
MAYA: You killed him?

25:04.671 --> 25:06.912
(SHOUTING)
You killed
my brother.

25:12.053 --> 25:13.384
(GROANING)

25:16.099 --> 25:18.306

25:30.488 --> 25:32.820

blood?

25:34.784 --> 25:36.399
(CRYING) Please.

25:43.876 --> 25:45.867
You had it here
all along?

25:47.922 --> 25:50.413
You and l have trust issues,
Doctor.

25:51.217 --> 25:52.923
Give it to her first.
Let me see you save her.

25:53.010 --> 25:54.716
Then, if it works...

25:54.804 --> 25:56.635
I'll let you save me.

25:58.516 --> 26:00.222
It was a lie?
Another lie?

26:00.309 --> 26:03.893
No. Please.
You have to understand.
None of this was my decision.

26:03.980 --> 26:06.562
But I saw you get shot.
I saw it!

26:06.649 --> 26:08.310
It's because of you.

26:08.401 --> 26:10.733
They injected me
with your blood.

26:11.112 --> 26:12.568
lt healed me.

26:15.658 --> 26:16.738
I don't get it...

26:16.826 --> 26:18.566
And we're just supposed
to pretend you weren't dead?

26:18.661 --> 26:21.448
This is an impossible
situation. And it's just
getting worse.

26:21.539 --> 26:22.619
Claire, you have to stop.

26:22.707 --> 26:23.787
Stop what?

26:23.875 --> 26:26.082
Your plans
to expose the Company.
lt's unacceptable.

26:26.169 --> 26:28.626
We destroy them
and we get our lives back.
You back.

26:28.713 --> 26:30.749
No. If you push this,
they will react.

26:30.840 --> 26:32.000
React?

26:32.675 --> 26:35.007
No, it's not gonna
come to that.

26:35.094 --> 26:37.551
I've made a deal
that's gonna keep
you all alive.

26:37.638 --> 26:39.014
CLAIRE: What deal?

26:39.849 --> 26:42.010
l have to go
back with them.

26:42.518 --> 26:46.102
And you all will live
normal lives. That's all
I've ever wanted for you.

26:46.189 --> 26:49.101
You can't. Please.

26:49.192 --> 26:51.854
