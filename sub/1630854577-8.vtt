WEBVTT

00:15.056 --> 00:18.393
Well, if it isn't our
favorite...

00:18.435 --> 00:21.229
What are you anyway?
Possum? Weasel?

00:21.271 --> 00:23.064
If you wanna see a weasel,
just look in the mirror.

00:23.106 --> 00:24.733
-Yikes!

00:24.775 --> 00:25.943
Enough!

00:25.985 --> 00:28.320
I have one question for you,

00:28.362 --> 00:32.240
and you need to answer it
very, very carefully.

00:32.282 --> 00:35.327
You've already stolen
my Shatter Drive technology.

00:35.369 --> 00:36.745
What else do you want?

00:36.787 --> 00:38.372
There's a whole Shatterverse

00:38.413 --> 00:40.332
of other worlds
for us to conquer.

00:40.374 --> 00:41.917
And to do that,

00:41.959 --> 00:45.337
we'll need this mothership
fully operational.

00:46.421 --> 00:48.340
Figure it out yourselves.

00:48.382 --> 00:50.551
Or we could figure out
how to take you apart

00:50.592 --> 00:53.094
piece by piece.

00:53.136 --> 00:54.805
It's up to you.

01:15.158 --> 01:16.994
You know these scallywags?

01:17.036 --> 01:20.288
Yes and no. Short version,
they're after the Shard too.

01:20.330 --> 01:21.916
You mean
the Devil's Lighthouse?

01:21.957 --> 01:23.542
Let 'em have it!

01:23.584 --> 01:26.253
I already told you,
I want nothing to do with it.

01:28.255 --> 01:29.381
Whoa!

01:36.597 --> 01:41.351
By order of the Chaos Council
surrender or be destroyed.

01:41.393 --> 01:43.896
Rusty, this isn't
New Yoke City.

01:43.938 --> 01:45.940
Come on, let's
talk this through.

01:45.981 --> 01:47.357
Quiet, hedgehog.

01:47.399 --> 01:50.027
I am addressing the captain.

01:50.069 --> 01:52.446
He be the captain!

01:52.487 --> 01:55.365
Sonic is the captain?

01:55.407 --> 01:57.701
I wish I were programmed
to laugh.

01:57.743 --> 01:59.327
How are you even here?

01:59.369 --> 02:01.705
The tides of war have changed.

02:01.747 --> 02:04.207
And as for how I am here,

02:04.249 --> 02:08.253
all of the Shatterverse is now
the Council's for the taking.

02:08.295 --> 02:12.340
Last chance:
surrender or sink.

02:12.382 --> 02:14.676
What's the plan, Cap'n?
Hang 'em from the yardarm,

02:14.718 --> 02:18.722
send 'em down to Davey Jones,
cleave them to their biscuits?

02:18.764 --> 02:23.184
I hear you talking, but I have
no idea what you're saying.

02:23.226 --> 02:25.186
-Fire.

02:27.982 --> 02:30.692
The Angel's Voyage is
holding up surprisingly well.

02:30.734 --> 02:33.236
Aye, she's stronger
than she looks.

02:33.278 --> 02:35.614
You gonna do something,
Cap'n?

02:35.656 --> 02:37.365
You bet I am!

02:37.407 --> 02:38.909
I know this crew.

02:38.951 --> 02:41.578
They're a well-oiled
fighting machine.

02:41.620 --> 02:45.206
Battle stations,
go, go, go! Uhh!

02:47.334 --> 02:50.378
You bill-sucking buffoon!
They don't know what to do.

02:50.420 --> 02:52.589
They've never been
in combat before.

02:52.631 --> 02:54.883
Where we going?

02:54.925 --> 02:57.845
-Shoot this at them.
-Aye, aye, Captain!

03:20.450 --> 03:22.703
This is bad. Sails!

03:23.704 --> 03:25.747
OK, pal,
I may not know you-you,

03:25.789 --> 03:28.834
but I know other yous,
and they've all got gizmos.

03:28.876 --> 03:30.627
Tell me you've got a gizmo.

03:30.669 --> 03:34.339
The only gizmo I need is
me contraption and me brains.

03:34.381 --> 03:36.257
You're a beauty,
you know that?

03:36.299 --> 03:37.968
-Just a beauty.

03:38.010 --> 03:40.804
Sound the retreat
before we're sunk!

03:43.431 --> 03:45.517
<i>Shard energy compass</i>
<i>calibrated.</i>

03:45.559 --> 03:48.062
That's not good.
Come here!

03:52.107 --> 03:54.943
Perfect.
We have what we need.

03:54.985 --> 03:57.905
This demarks the end
of our time together.

03:59.447 --> 04:00.824
Vaporize them.

04:00.866 --> 04:02.868
Goodbye, Sonic.

04:07.831 --> 04:09.708
Who is that?

04:11.501 --> 04:15.296
Wait. Set course,
and we will be on our way.

04:15.338 --> 04:18.926
No need to waste time
destroying a sinking ship.

04:29.061 --> 04:31.105
Cap'n, we're taking on
too much water.

04:31.146 --> 04:34.858
Come on!
I need you to steer!

04:34.900 --> 04:37.694
No point in steering
a sinking ship, Cap'n.

04:37.736 --> 04:40.280
She only goes one direction,
straight down.

04:40.321 --> 04:43.117
But they're after
the Devil's Lighthouse.

04:43.158 --> 04:46.453
Oh, no, no, this isn't over.
I can fix this.

04:47.454 --> 04:50.040
Fine, I can't fix this.

04:50.082 --> 04:52.126
I'm no sea captain.

04:52.167 --> 04:55.212
But I know someone who is.
Where's Dread?

04:57.338 --> 04:58.506
Dread!

04:58.548 --> 05:00.050
Wait, where are you going?

05:00.092 --> 05:01.593
Dread!

05:01.635 --> 05:03.804
I don't care what version
of Knuckles you are,

05:03.845 --> 05:06.974
you don't give up.
It's your most annoying virtue.

05:07.015 --> 05:10.018
This Shard is my only hope
of finding my home.

05:10.060 --> 05:12.813
I need you.
Your crew needs you.

05:12.854 --> 05:16.900
You're Knuckles The Dread,
captain of the Angel's Voyage.

05:16.942 --> 05:18.193
Dread!

05:18.235 --> 05:20.487
I gave up years ago, Blue,

05:20.528 --> 05:24.449
when I wrecked trying to get
that shiny rock you're after.

05:24.491 --> 05:25.784
We can still get it.

05:25.826 --> 05:28.328
With your captaining
and my speed,

05:28.369 --> 05:30.413
you're not gonna wreck
on those rocks again.

05:30.455 --> 05:31.999
He is fast--

05:32.040 --> 05:34.960
fast enough to get me
past them rocks.

05:35.002 --> 05:37.296
We can do it together!

05:37.337 --> 05:39.047
And I can get home!

05:39.089 --> 05:41.382
And I'll finally
get me treasure.

05:41.424 --> 05:43.010
And you'll forever be known

05:43.051 --> 05:45.762
as the legendary
Knuckles The Dread!

05:45.804 --> 05:49.474
The legendary
Knuckles The Dread!

05:49.516 --> 05:50.809
Aye.

05:50.851 --> 05:54.688
The legendary
Knuckles The Dread.

05:56.355 --> 05:58.900
He gave up. He's gone.

06:00.319 --> 06:03.864
Don't worry, we're gonna
be fine. Right, bros?

06:03.905 --> 06:05.699
Aye, Cap'n.

06:07.617 --> 06:09.286
Oh, who I be kidding?

06:10.329 --> 06:11.746
We're doomed!

06:14.166 --> 06:16.751
Hold onto something!

06:16.793 --> 06:19.629
Well, looks like
we're going down.

06:19.671 --> 06:22.924
Ha! What kind of talk is that?

06:22.966 --> 06:25.844
We're back! Arr!

06:25.886 --> 06:28.180
I knew you'd be back, Captain.

06:28.222 --> 06:32.893
Batten, Sails, get below, pump
up every floaty you can find.

06:32.934 --> 06:34.228
Aye-aye, Captain.

06:34.269 --> 06:35.562
Rose, Catfish,

06:35.603 --> 06:37.396
mend the mast as best ye can,

06:37.438 --> 06:38.773
then hoist the main sail.

06:41.360 --> 06:43.444
I knew you
wouldn't abandon your crew.

06:43.486 --> 06:45.197
That's the Knuckles I know.

06:45.239 --> 06:49.576
I may be back,
but it ain't for me crew.

07:23.777 --> 07:25.612
Pull!

07:28.949 --> 07:30.742
Yes, yes!

07:30.784 --> 07:32.535
Weird, but yes!

07:32.577 --> 07:34.371
Whoo-hoo! We did it!

07:34.413 --> 07:37.374
And now the Lighthouse.

07:37.416 --> 07:40.001
Uh, Cap'n,
haven't you always said

07:40.043 --> 07:42.379
that the way to
the Devil's Lighthouse was...

07:42.421 --> 07:43.880
Certain death.

07:43.922 --> 07:46.216
That I did. And it is.

07:46.258 --> 07:48.385
I've chartered a course
in me mind.

07:48.427 --> 07:52.097
Don't ye worry,
I have a plan.

07:52.139 --> 07:56.184
-It's going to be legendary.

08:02.732 --> 08:05.360
We will reach the asset
within the hour.

08:08.905 --> 08:10.949
You are breaking up.

08:10.991 --> 08:13.952
Something's wrong
with the connection!

08:13.994 --> 08:16.079
Oh, for the love of quiche!

08:18.581 --> 08:20.041
Ah, it doesn't matter.

08:20.083 --> 08:22.585
We can communicate
across the worlds.

08:22.627 --> 08:26.881
Our conquest of
the Shatterverse has begun.

08:31.094 --> 08:33.472
Agreed.
With our work complete,

08:33.513 --> 08:36.057
I'll give our girlbot
the go-ahead

08:36.099 --> 08:38.852
on Operation Elimination.

08:40.187 --> 08:43.023
Eliminating the hedgehog
is a bad idea.

08:43.064 --> 08:46.401
Arguing for the life
of your friend? What a shock.

08:46.443 --> 08:50.280
He left me at your mercy
when I needed him most,

08:50.322 --> 08:53.074
hardly what you'd call
friendly behavior.

08:53.116 --> 08:55.327
But you'd be fools
to get rid of him

08:55.369 --> 08:57.578
before the Shatter Drive
technology is perfected.

08:57.620 --> 08:59.456
It is perfected.

08:59.498 --> 09:02.834
We've traveled to another
Shatter space.

09:02.876 --> 09:05.170
You sent your robots
to another Shatter space.

09:05.212 --> 09:08.673
Big difference.
You've only barely accomplished

09:08.715 --> 09:11.301
what he's done
without any technology.

09:11.343 --> 09:13.803
He's a living Shatter battery.

09:16.890 --> 09:19.017
Till we know why
he gives off this power,

09:19.059 --> 09:21.269
we need him alive.

09:21.311 --> 09:24.605
What...!

09:24.647 --> 09:26.400
The rat's right.

09:26.441 --> 09:30.362
Too many questions for us
to start playing exterminator--

09:30.404 --> 09:32.989
at least, not until
after we ring

09:33.031 --> 09:38.161
every ounce of Shatter juice
out of that blue varmint.

10:06.398 --> 10:08.442
They're slowing down, Cap'n.

10:08.483 --> 10:10.860
Yes, they're slowing down.

10:10.902 --> 10:12.653
Why are they slowing down?

10:12.695 --> 10:14.822
That be because of the rocks.

10:14.864 --> 10:17.325
As in the ones
you wrecked on before?

10:17.367 --> 10:19.369
Aye, that be them.

10:19.411 --> 10:21.413
Danger dead ahead!

10:22.330 --> 10:24.207
Danger dead ahead!

10:26.251 --> 10:28.420
Dread, this is
your second chance.

10:28.462 --> 10:29.796
You know how to do this.

10:29.837 --> 10:31.423
Faster!

10:31.465 --> 10:34.551
Run as fast
as your blue legs can go!

10:35.969 --> 10:37.845
You tried to play captain,

10:37.887 --> 10:40.681
now see how a legend does it.

10:45.853 --> 10:47.855
They are not slowing down.

10:47.897 --> 10:49.857
What are those fools up to?

10:49.899 --> 10:52.527
Chart a course
to the island.

10:52.569 --> 10:57.157
After today, everyone will know
the name Knuckles The Dread,

10:57.198 --> 10:58.575
and marvel.

10:58.617 --> 11:00.452
I said faster!

11:04.705 --> 11:06.124
Watch it, keep us steady.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.376
Hold on to your shoelaces!

11:23.850 --> 11:25.310
No, me sails!

11:29.397 --> 11:31.191
Curses!

11:31.232 --> 11:32.733
That was incredible!

11:32.775 --> 11:34.319
Aye, it was.

11:34.361 --> 11:37.155
But we're not done yet.
We're out of sails.

11:37.197 --> 11:39.199
And that's bad, right?

11:39.240 --> 11:41.909
It would be for anyone else.

11:44.245 --> 11:46.498
Oh, this is bad.

11:46.540 --> 11:49.292
You're gonna use your
special shoes and tow us,

11:49.334 --> 11:51.752
or we're gonna wreck
on those rocks.

11:51.794 --> 11:53.380
Huh, tough choice.

11:53.421 --> 11:55.006
No choice at all.

11:57.050 --> 12:00.679
-Ship off the starboard side.
-How about it, speed-o?

12:00.719 --> 12:04.015
And I'm blaming you if
anything goes wrong this time.

12:08.562 --> 12:10.271
Huh?

12:10.313 --> 12:13.024
Uh... Huh?

12:20.198 --> 12:23.742
Full speed ahead now!

12:27.163 --> 12:29.040
I don't lose races,

12:29.082 --> 12:31.376
especially not
at the finish line.

12:31.418 --> 12:34.462
Come on, come on, come on,
come on!

12:42.303 --> 12:43.430
Whoa!

12:43.471 --> 12:44.763
Whoa!

12:45.890 --> 12:48.893
-Ah!
-Well, I'll be a salty sea dog.

12:52.439 --> 12:53.981
Get to ye battle stations!

12:54.023 --> 12:56.150
-Yes!

13:04.867 --> 13:06.994
The hedgehog is unaware

13:07.036 --> 13:10.540
of the full capabilities
of this ship.

13:13.710 --> 13:15.754
Arr, that's not good.

13:19.382 --> 13:20.967
Lasers!

13:21.008 --> 13:22.343
I hate lasers!

13:22.385 --> 13:24.638
They're going for Sonic!

13:24.679 --> 13:26.097
Man the cannons!

13:26.139 --> 13:28.308
Give 'em everything
we've got.

13:28.349 --> 13:30.310
Charge!

13:37.900 --> 13:41.195
Cap'n, we can't take
many more hits like that.

13:41.237 --> 13:43.864
She'll hold. Return fire!

14:01.549 --> 14:04.761
Catfish, you beauty!
Again!

14:09.098 --> 14:10.266
Fire!

14:14.479 --> 14:16.147
The Shard!

14:19.526 --> 14:22.570
Last case of seadogs,
Cap'n.

14:22.612 --> 14:24.280
Make 'em count.

14:26.533 --> 14:27.992
Fire!

14:35.500 --> 14:37.585
-Whoo-hoo!
-Yes.

14:49.305 --> 14:50.849
Watch out!

14:51.932 --> 14:55.186
Heave to
and prepare to be boarded!

14:55.228 --> 14:56.771
Board?

14:59.816 --> 15:01.150
Not without me.

15:10.034 --> 15:12.787
And that's the last
of ye scallywags.

15:12.829 --> 15:16.082
Come on, ye cowards,
she's all clear!

15:28.052 --> 15:29.303
Ah!

15:30.304 --> 15:31.389
Rrr!

15:40.690 --> 15:42.692
You dare attack us?

15:42.734 --> 15:44.819
You don't know the half of it.

16:06.090 --> 16:07.341
Charge!

16:27.528 --> 16:30.907
Enough of this.
Squad three, get the Shard.

16:34.327 --> 16:35.620
Sonic, go!

16:35.662 --> 16:37.580
They're after the treasure.

16:40.082 --> 16:42.335
No, you go.
I'll hold them off here.

16:45.338 --> 16:48.925
Blast. I don't think
I can make it. It's too far!

16:48.967 --> 16:50.802
Can't make it? Too far?

16:50.844 --> 16:52.720
Hey, remember when you
threw me off the ship?

16:52.762 --> 16:54.555
Aye.

16:54.597 --> 16:56.683
Well, you need to learn
how to spin, my friend.

17:00.019 --> 17:03.230
Do not let him get away.
After him.

17:08.945 --> 17:12.198
This ends now.

17:12.239 --> 17:13.783
Fine by me.

17:29.883 --> 17:31.384
My beauty.

17:56.868 --> 17:58.160
Ya!

17:58.202 --> 18:00.454
Heads up, matey.

18:00.496 --> 18:02.498
Hey, thanks for
the save, Batten.

18:04.000 --> 18:08.046
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

18:08.087 --> 18:10.297
Don't worry, I've got ye.

18:10.339 --> 18:12.132
Uhh!

18:12.174 --> 18:13.968
-Ow!

18:17.764 --> 18:21.141
You have proven
a worthy foe, Sonic.

18:21.183 --> 18:24.103
Not that anyone
will remember you.

18:24.144 --> 18:26.397
Now you're just being hurtful.

18:30.276 --> 18:33.863
Really? Preparing
for a last charge?

18:33.905 --> 18:35.949
Something like that.

18:40.119 --> 18:41.454
He's left us.

18:54.050 --> 18:56.469
Now, where were we?

19:12.568 --> 19:14.194
Rrrah!

19:14.236 --> 19:16.823
Raah!

19:30.461 --> 19:32.171
Ah-ha!

19:36.258 --> 19:37.677
At last.

19:37.718 --> 19:40.888
She be mine.

19:42.807 --> 19:47.103
Mine forever.

19:50.439 --> 19:52.942
Dread, he got the Shard.

19:54.861 --> 19:56.195
He's gonna need some backup.

19:56.236 --> 19:59.157
I'll go get him.
Be right back.

20:04.162 --> 20:05.830
You.

20:05.872 --> 20:09.167
Do it just be me, or does she
look a little like you?

20:09.208 --> 20:10.751
Maybe we should tie her up.

20:19.677 --> 20:21.637
No, she's mine.

20:21.679 --> 20:22.763
Mine!

20:47.121 --> 20:48.372
Dread!

20:51.458 --> 20:53.169
Sonic.

20:55.254 --> 20:56.839
Got ya.

21:18.277 --> 21:20.529
Shadow?
Ugh!

21:20.571 --> 21:23.741
I don't have time
to deal with whoever<i> you</i> are.

21:23.783 --> 21:25.743
I just wanna go home.

21:25.785 --> 21:27.327
Home?

21:27.369 --> 21:31.082
Home doesn't exist anymore...
because of you!
