IANNIS: How long have you
been deaf in this ear?

01:18.525 --> 01:20.880
STAMATIS: Since as long
as I can remember.

01:20.965 --> 01:22.115
-[Snip]
-Ow!

01:22.206 --> 01:23.480
MRS STAMATIS: Shut up!

01:23.566 --> 01:26.080
Keep still while the doctor
is examining you.

01:26.166 --> 01:27.884
IANNIS: I need a fish-hook...

01:27.966 --> 01:29.764
about the right size
for a mullet...

01:29.847 --> 01:32.838
with a long shank,
and a hammer.

01:32.926 --> 01:35.121
STAMATIS:
A fish-hook? A hammer?

01:35.206 --> 01:36.640
MRS STAMATIS:
Here's a fish-hook...

01:36.727 --> 01:38.445
and a hammer.

01:38.527 --> 01:40.995
IANNIS: Ahem.

01:41.087 --> 01:46.765
[Tapping]

01:46.848 --> 01:50.601
Right. Now keep still.

01:50.688 --> 01:51.837
[Pop]

01:51.928 --> 01:53.122
STAMATIS: Ow!

01:55.448 --> 01:57.279
IANNIS: A pea.

01:59.089 --> 02:01.966
It is very papilionaceous,
is it not?

02:02.048 --> 02:05.724
He must have stuck it
in his ear when he was a child.

02:05.809 --> 02:07.481
Oh, my God, it's loud.

02:07.569 --> 02:10.401
I mean, everything is loud.
My own voice is loud.

02:10.489 --> 02:14.881
Your deafness is cured.
A very satisfactory operation.

02:14.970 --> 02:16.368
I've had an operation?

02:16.449 --> 02:20.238
Ha! I'm the only person I know
who's had an operation.

02:20.330 --> 02:22.241
It feels as if my whole head...

02:22.330 --> 02:25.208
has filled up with spring water,
all cold and clear.

02:25.290 --> 02:26.804
Talk some sense
when the doctor...

02:26.891 --> 02:28.370
has been kind enough
to cure you.

02:28.451 --> 02:30.725
All these years
thinking you are deaf.

02:30.810 --> 02:34.690
But now there will be no excuses
when I ask you to remember...

02:34.771 --> 02:36.602
to collect something
on your way home.

02:36.691 --> 02:40.206
Or to stoke up the fire
before we go to church.

02:40.291 --> 02:41.805
[Bell ringing]

02:41.892 --> 02:43.610
MRS STAMATIS: Perhaps now
you will hear me...

02:43.692 --> 02:46.330
when I say to you,
"Mend the chair, Stamatis.

02:46.411 --> 02:48.448
"Fix the leaking roof,
Stamatis. "

02:48.532 --> 02:51.649
And now I won't have
to speak so loud...

03:01.972 --> 03:07.650
IANNIS: Antonio,
do you remember our island?

03:07.733 --> 03:10.885
It does not change.

03:10.974 --> 03:13.851
On the feast day
of Saint Gerasimos...

03:13.933 --> 03:16.242
we still bring our sick
to the holy place...

03:16.334 --> 03:20.247
and pray that
their suffering may cease.

03:22.814 --> 03:26.205
When Pelagia was a child,
I promised her...

03:26.295 --> 03:28.808
that I would write
a history of Cephallonia...

03:28.894 --> 03:34.253
but somehow I still
have not found the time.

03:34.335 --> 03:38.852
I wanted her to understand
how a land so peaceful...

03:38.936 --> 03:42.894
could be shattered
by earthquakes and war.

03:44.775 --> 03:46.767
I wanted her to understand...

03:46.856 --> 03:49.006
why sometimes
the gods bless us...

03:49.096 --> 03:53.010
and why they sometimes
become angry...

03:53.097 --> 03:59.172
and shake us,
and fill our lives with pain.

03:59.257 --> 04:03.853
I want her to learn the lesson
that nature teaches us.

04:03.937 --> 04:07.977
That we should not ask
why we are wounded...

04:08.058 --> 04:12.528
only if the wound
can be healed.

04:18.778 --> 04:20.735
[Speaking Greek]

04:25.218 --> 04:27.095
[Praying in Greek]

04:29.899 --> 04:32.971
A purely psychological
phenomenon.

04:33.059 --> 04:35.733
STAMATIS: How do you
explain the miracle?

04:35.820 --> 04:39.607
Can Lenin cure the mad?
Can Stalin heal the afflicted?

04:39.699 --> 04:42.339
It's obvious.
It's a set-up!

04:42.420 --> 04:44.615
To keep people
enslaved to religion.

04:44.700 --> 04:45.928
You don't have to shout.

04:46.020 --> 04:47.499
I'm not deaf.

04:48.780 --> 04:50.737
[Cheering]

04:54.100 --> 04:56.056
[Greek music playing]

05:28.783 --> 05:32.060
I want to see the cannon again.

05:32.144 --> 05:34.180
-Yeah!
-Cannon!

05:34.264 --> 05:37.494
All right.

05:37.583 --> 05:40.257
I will need stones
from the street.

05:40.344 --> 05:42.414
As many as you can find.

05:43.704 --> 05:45.023
Be right back.

05:46.705 --> 05:48.138
VELISARIOS: Ready, children?

05:48.225 --> 05:50.101
Cover your ears.

Ow, that hurts!
Oh, that hurts!

06:09.786 --> 06:11.105
VELISARIOS: Will he die?

06:12.466 --> 06:15.698
Eventually, one of these days,
like all of us.

06:15.787 --> 06:17.106
Turn over.

06:26.827 --> 06:30.264
-Aah!
-Good, strong gluteals.

06:30.348 --> 06:32.066
-Pelagia.
-Hmm?

06:32.148 --> 06:33.899
Tell us about the gluteals.

06:33.987 --> 06:36.263
Please, come closer.
Have a good look.

06:36.348 --> 06:40.102
Fetch your friends.
Everybody's welcome.

06:40.188 --> 06:42.224
Gluteals.

06:42.308 --> 06:46.018
Maximus, medius, minimus.

06:46.109 --> 06:48.941
The maximus is the external
surface of the ilium...

06:49.028 --> 06:52.578
between anterior
and interior gluteal lines...

06:55.229 --> 06:56.423
DROSOULA: Mandras!

06:58.630 --> 06:59.779
Iatre...

06:59.870 --> 07:01.860
He'll be fine.

07:01.949 --> 07:05.420
They told me you were shot.
I thought I was going to die.

07:05.510 --> 07:07.865
I don't know why you can't
keep out of trouble!

07:07.950 --> 07:09.463
I don't know!

07:09.550 --> 07:12.543
Iatre, you should count yourself
lucky you don't have a son.

07:12.631 --> 07:16.384
Boys, they never grow up.
Look at me.

07:16.470 --> 07:19.508
Old before my time.

07:20.871 --> 07:23.101
MANDRAS: Aah! Aah!

07:25.271 --> 07:27.228
[Speaking Greek]

07:55.234 --> 07:56.587
It's too hot.

07:56.674 --> 07:59.745
The fish are all hiding
in the rocks...

07:59.833 --> 08:02.871
or keeping cool
at the bottom of the sea.

08:06.834 --> 08:09.872
Aah! No, Mandras!

08:09.955 --> 08:11.593
[Laughing] Aah!

08:11.675 --> 08:13.744
No! Put me down! Put me down!

08:13.834 --> 08:16.064
-Waah!
-Aah!

08:16.155 --> 08:17.986
-Whoo!
-Aah!

08:18.075 --> 08:20.031
[Laughing]

08:24.196 --> 08:25.515
Ha ha!

08:36.035 --> 08:37.515
that a Greek battleship,
the Eli...

08:37.597 --> 08:39.394
has been torpedoed
by an Italian submarine...

08:39.477 --> 08:42.626
despite the fact that Greece
is not yet involved in the war.

08:42.716 --> 08:45.470
Prime Minister Metaxas
has protested strongly...

08:45.557 --> 08:47.149
to Mussolini's government
in Rome...

08:47.237 --> 08:50.229
which has denied
responsibility for the attack.

08:50.317 --> 08:52.149
And there are continued
reports of fighting...

08:52.238 --> 08:53.990
between Greek
and Italian soldiers...

08:54.078 --> 08:55.908
on the Greek-Albanian border.

08:55.997 --> 08:57.555
But in Athens this morning...

08:57.637 --> 08:59.071
the Italian ambassador
once again denied...

08:59.158 --> 09:00.716
What are they saying?

09:00.798 --> 09:03.995
The Italians are in Albania,
close to the border.

09:04.078 --> 09:05.875
They have reported
some fighting.

09:05.958 --> 09:07.551
There! You hear that?

09:07.639 --> 09:10.198
They are saying they are
not about to declare war.

09:10.278 --> 09:11.472
There. What did I say?

09:11.558 --> 09:13.311
They want to catch us sleeping.

09:13.399 --> 09:15.833
They want to creep up on us
in the dead of night!

09:15.919 --> 09:18.717
-You filthy liar!
-Your father was a goat!

09:18.799 --> 09:21.360
Shut up!

09:21.440 --> 09:23.112
If you two don't stop
trading insults...

09:23.200 --> 09:25.155
I'm going to start
taking coffee at home.

09:28.240 --> 09:29.832
[Footsteps]

09:29.920 --> 09:32.912
PELAGIA:
Mandras wants to marry me.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.595
I told him
he'd have to ask you.

09:35.681 --> 09:37.637
IANNIS:
I don't want to marry him.

09:37.721 --> 09:40.280
You don't like him.

09:40.360 --> 09:42.431
You are both too young.

09:42.521 --> 09:46.070
Everyone is too young
when they marry.

09:46.161 --> 09:47.958
I have often thought
that you would...

09:48.041 --> 09:49.600
only ever be able
to marry happily...

09:49.682 --> 09:51.673
with a foreigner.

09:51.762 --> 09:53.240
BOTH: A dentist from Norway...

09:53.321 --> 09:55.312
...or something.

09:57.682 --> 10:02.039
Mandras is not your equal,
and he would expect...

10:02.122 --> 10:04.557
to be better than his wife.

10:04.643 --> 10:08.112
He is a man, after all.

10:08.202 --> 10:11.001
I will tell you now
what I will say to him.

10:11.083 --> 10:14.200
I am not giving away a dowry.

10:15.683 --> 10:17.401
Who marries without a dowry?

10:17.483 --> 10:19.440
You should marry for love.

10:19.524 --> 10:20.798
I love Mandras.

10:23.083 --> 10:25.757
So what am I supposed to do?

10:25.844 --> 10:27.436
Go off
to Mandras' mother's house...

10:27.524 --> 10:29.594
with nothing
but a bag of clothes?

10:29.684 --> 10:32.643
Oh, and my goat.

10:32.725 --> 10:34.522
I'll never be able
to show my face.

10:34.605 --> 10:37.072
I'll be the laughing stock
of Cephallonia.

10:37.164 --> 10:39.599
You can imagine
how people will talk.

10:39.685 --> 10:42.597
I don't know
how you will bear the shame.

10:42.685 --> 10:46.759
There is going to be a war.
Terrible things happen in wars.

10:46.846 --> 10:49.440
Use this to defend yourself.

10:49.526 --> 10:52.995
And, if necessary,
use it against yourself.

10:53.085 --> 10:55.156
Your marriage
will have to wait.

10:57.766 --> 10:59.404
I look around me.

10:59.486 --> 11:02.524
I see fishermen.
I see farmers.

11:02.607 --> 11:06.121
I see strong, healthy men
who are born free.

11:06.206 --> 11:09.438
But today your freedom
is in danger.

11:09.527 --> 11:11.916
The Italian Army
sweeps through Albania...

11:12.007 --> 11:16.126

about your country...

when you were dancing...

56:43.279 --> 56:45.189
the way you were moving...

56:46.878 --> 56:49.632
The turn of your head.

56:49.719 --> 56:50.868
[Sighs]

56:50.959 --> 56:52.950
I thought
I could watch you forever.

56:55.039 --> 56:57.634
You think you can come here...

56:57.720 --> 57:01.507
and turn my whole world
upside-down?

57:04.200 --> 57:04.473

This is all I have.

57:10.481 --> 57:11.755
I can't give you any morphine.

57:11.841 --> 57:14.308
And we need
all the quinine we have.

57:14.400 --> 57:15.674
12,000 of our men
on the mainland...

57:15.760 --> 57:17.113
are sick with malaria.

57:17.200 --> 57:19.157
Supplies
are not getting through.

57:19.241 --> 57:21.550
Nobody knows why, nobody
knows what is happening...

57:21.641 --> 57:23.632
and I'm going to eat.

57:27.362 --> 57:31.400
You know,
when I met Pelagia's mother...

57:31.481 --> 57:35.521
she was betrothed
to somebody else.

57:35.602 --> 57:38.116
He nearly killed me.

57:38.202 --> 57:40.478
I had to leave the island.

57:40.563 --> 57:42.553
I had to lie low for a while.

57:45.843 --> 57:49.722
She wants to train
to be a doctor, you know.

57:49.803 --> 57:53.717
You think
she'd make a good doctor?

57:53.804 --> 57:56.238
I think she'd make
a very good doctor.

58:00.043 --> 58:02.035
IANNIS: Oh, uh...

58:04.884 --> 58:07.353
Another thing.

58:07.445 --> 58:11.198
This is a very ancient land...

58:11.284 --> 58:13.514
and we have had nothing
but earthquakes...

58:13.604 --> 58:16.073
and slaughter for 2,000 years.

58:16.165 --> 58:18.725
We've had massacres
at Sami and Fiskardo...

58:18.805 --> 58:21.444
and God knows where else.

58:21.526 --> 58:25.041
There will be more.

It's only a question of time.

other races
are inferior to yours.

01:00:13.733 --> 01:00:15.052
It's a question of science.

01:00:15.133 --> 01:00:16.806
You can't alter
a scientific fact.

01:00:16.894 --> 01:00:18.486
I don't care about science.

01:00:18.574 --> 01:00:20.450
It's morality that counts.

What is your morality?

01:00:21.853 --> 01:00:23.003
CORELLI:
If I were to see a man...

01:00:23.094 --> 01:00:24.573
being set upon by others...

01:00:24.654 --> 01:00:26.645
I would think
that man was my brother.

01:00:26.734 --> 01:00:28.167
That is my morality.

01:00:28.254 --> 01:00:30.689
I would make myself
believe it's personal.

01:00:30.775 --> 01:00:33.005
For me, too,
the war is personal.

01:00:33.095 --> 01:00:35.164
I lost both my grandfathers
in the Great War.

01:00:35.254 --> 01:00:36.812

01:00:39.815 --> 01:00:43.046
I grew up in a country
where it was hard to survive.

01:00:43.135 --> 01:00:45.172
We were hungry all the time.

01:00:45.256 --> 01:00:47.724
All we ever knew about
was defeat. But now--

Sometimes it is better...

01:00:49.295 --> 01:00:53.209

so much blood on your hands.

and everything is peaceful...

01:00:56.576 --> 01:00:59.967

I don't care
if the world knows it.

01:04:00.909 --> 01:04:02.103
I couldn't care less...

01:04:02.189 --> 01:04:04.784
if I never pick up
the mandolin again.

01:04:04.870 --> 01:04:09.226
When I was playing, it felt like
my hands were lumps of wood.

01:04:10.509 --> 01:04:15.300
It felt as if every note
was sour, stale.

01:04:17.870 --> 01:04:20.749
And then I realised--

01:04:20.831 --> 01:04:23.503
it's useless.

01:04:23.590 --> 01:04:25.387
It's hopeless.

01:04:26.871 --> 01:04:30.705

01:06:43.681 --> 01:06:45.238

01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:48.916
He's only fifteen.

01:06:49.001 --> 01:06:51.037
He always worshipped Mandras.

01:06:52.521 --> 01:06:53.795
Do you love him?

IANNIS:
When you fall in love...

01:07:14.602 --> 01:07:18.755
it is a temporary madness.

01:07:18.843 --> 01:07:23.678
It erupts like an earthquake,
and then it subsides.

01:07:23.763 --> 01:07:27.518
And when it subsides,
you have to make a decision.

01:07:27.604 --> 01:07:30.675
You have to work out
whether your roots...

01:07:30.763 --> 01:07:32.277
have become
so entwined together...

01:07:32.364 --> 01:07:34.082
that it is inconceivable...

01:07:34.164 --> 01:07:36.120
that you should ever part.

01:07:37.684 --> 01:07:41.803
Because this is what love is.

01:07:46.005 --> 01:07:49.361
Love is not breathlessness.
It is not excitement.

01:07:49.445 --> 01:07:52.278
It's not the desire to mate
every second of the day.

01:07:52.365 --> 01:07:53.845
It is not lying awake
at night...

01:07:53.926 --> 01:07:57.315
imagining that he is kissing
every part of your body.

01:08:01.086 --> 01:08:04.556
No, don't blush.

That is just being in love...

01:08:14.847 --> 01:08:19.602
which any of us
can convince ourselves we are.

01:08:19.687 --> 01:08:23.363
Love itself
is what is left over...

has burned away.

to Mandras and his mother.

of the island...

to an Italian withdrawal
might be...

01:11:39.541 --> 01:11:41.453

will assume sole command...

CAPTAIN: My men will
never agree to return home...

01:14:02.831 --> 01:14:04.390
without their weapons.

01:14:04.472 --> 01:14:07.111
If you surrender your arms
in times of war...

01:14:07.192 --> 01:14:08.704
then you are no longer a man.

01:14:08.791 --> 01:14:10.110
GANDIN: If you were
in their position...

01:14:10.191 --> 01:14:11.591
if you were German...

01:14:11.672 --> 01:14:14.550
you would want to be certain
for your own security...

01:14:14.632 --> 01:14:16.429
that the weapons
will not be passed on...

01:14:16.512 --> 01:14:19.664
to the Allied forces
or to the Greek partisans.

01:14:19.753 --> 01:14:21.106
Or turned against you.

01:14:23.552 --> 01:14:25.589
Or turned against you.

01:14:27.433 --> 01:14:29.389
[Engine revs]

01:14:56.955 --> 01:14:59.947
You must be looking forward
to going home.

01:15:00.035 --> 01:15:03.711
There'll be people happy
to see you again, I'm sure.

01:15:03.796 --> 01:15:07.105
Your family, your mother,
your wife.

01:15:07.195 --> 01:15:08.424
Your girlfriend?

01:15:09.956 --> 01:15:11.708
CORELLI: You wanted to see me?

01:15:11.796 --> 01:15:13.275
MANDRAS: We need arms.

01:15:13.356 --> 01:15:16.030
Machine guns,
ammunition, land mines...

01:15:16.117 --> 01:15:17.630
anything you can spare.

01:15:17.717 --> 01:15:19.468
How can I give you weapons?

01:15:19.556 --> 01:15:22.024
-You know I can't do that.
-You've surrendered.

01:15:22.116 --> 01:15:23.311
If you don't intend to fight...

01:15:23.397 --> 01:15:24.546
you won't be needing
your weapons.

01:15:24.637 --> 01:15:26.116
We have a country to defend.

01:15:26.197 --> 01:15:27.471
DIMITRIS:
There is a massive build up...

01:15:27.557 --> 01:15:29.468
of German troops
on the mainland.

01:15:29.558 --> 01:15:32.789
The 117th Jaeger Division
is nearing the Corinth Canal.

01:15:32.878 --> 01:15:35.710
The 104th is moving south
from Yugoslavia.

01:15:35.797 --> 01:15:38.028
Then you are not
in any position to resist.

01:15:38.118 --> 01:15:39.392
Unless we act now.

01:15:39.478 --> 01:15:42.629
Do you know, Captain,
on Lefkada island...

01:15:42.718 --> 01:15:44.232
all the Italians
who surrendered...

01:15:44.319 --> 01:15:47.197
have been sent
to prison camps in the north.

01:15:51.399 --> 01:15:53.117
We heard they went home.

01:15:53.199 --> 01:15:55.667
The trains were diverted
in Albania.

01:15:55.759 --> 01:15:57.909
MANDRAS:
In this war, Captain...

01:15:57.999 --> 01:16:00.355
it's hard to know
who you can trust.

01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:03.556
But one thing is certain--

01:16:03.639 --> 01:16:05.437
you can't trust the Germans.

01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:11.076
[Soldiers shouting]

01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:17.992
[Yells]

01:16:38.402 --> 01:16:40.120
Last night I dreamed
I was sitting...

01:16:40.202 --> 01:16:43.559
in a restaurant
in Piazza Navona...

01:16:43.643 --> 01:16:47.237
eating
zuppe di cozze piccante...

01:16:47.322 --> 01:16:50.235
then a plate
of tagliarini al boscaiolo.

01:16:57.124 --> 01:16:58.352
Colonel Barge has requested...

01:16:58.444 --> 01:17:01.435
I withdraw your battery
from Antisamos Beach.

01:17:04.324 --> 01:17:07.396
If they wanted to bring in
heavy reinforcements...

01:17:07.484 --> 01:17:10.636
this is where they would do it.

01:17:10.725 --> 01:17:12.397
Is this an order?

01:17:12.485 --> 01:17:14.042
Captain...

01:17:14.124 --> 01:17:16.080
don't you want to go home?

01:17:35.086 --> 01:17:37.042
[Vehicles rumbling]

01:18:08.889 --> 01:18:10.083
[German soldier yells]

01:18:17.769 --> 01:18:19.043
Are you going to let us through?

01:18:19.129 --> 01:18:20.528
My orders are to supervise...

01:18:20.609 --> 01:18:22.726
the surrender
of your arms and weapons.

01:18:23.770 --> 01:18:25.680
[Soldiers cocking guns]

01:18:31.330 --> 01:18:34.481
The deadline for the hand-over
is at noon tomorrow.

01:18:34.570 --> 01:18:36.243
WEBER: Antonio.

01:18:38.810 --> 01:18:41.722
This order comes
from Colonel Barge.

01:18:41.810 --> 01:18:43.130
He has asked me personally...

01:18:43.211 --> 01:18:45.486
to assure you that
if you surrender your arms...

01:18:45.571 --> 01:18:48.802
you will be guaranteed
safe passage.

01:18:48.891 --> 01:18:52.043
Like the Italian garrison
at Lefkada?

01:18:53.411 --> 01:18:55.641
Lefkada?

01:18:55.731 --> 01:18:57.962
But they laid down
their weapons.

01:18:58.052 --> 01:18:59.280
They went home.

01:19:20.134 --> 01:19:21.362
[Weapon thumps]

01:19:26.054 --> 01:19:27.885

01:19:36.934 --> 01:19:38.970
[Soldier yells in German]

01:19:39.054 --> 01:19:42.092
You must be looking forward
to seeing ltaly again.

01:19:45.375 --> 01:19:46.729
Do you think
we could keep in touch?

01:19:49.056 --> 01:19:51.330
I mean, after the war,
of course.

01:19:56.296 --> 01:19:58.252
[Soldiers speaking German]

01:20:05.136 --> 01:20:08.288
You can have my gun when
I've finished my cigarette.

01:20:12.977 --> 01:20:14.774
Get your hands off me, you ba--

01:20:16.738 --> 01:20:18.693
[Gunfire and shouting]

01:20:22.858 --> 01:20:24.814
[Soldiers shouting]

01:20:32.459 --> 01:20:33.937
I understand your concern.

01:20:34.018 --> 01:20:36.487
If I were in your shoes, I would
be asking questions, too.

01:20:36.579 --> 01:20:38.490
Of course, we will
investigate what happened--

01:20:38.579 --> 01:20:40.968
I can tell you
what happened--

01:20:41.059 --> 01:20:42.208
My men are dead!

01:20:42.299 --> 01:20:43.892
...take the appropriate action.

01:20:43.980 --> 01:20:46.699
CORELLI: What does that mean?

01:20:46.780 --> 01:20:50.408
Does it mean that I can write
to the families of these men...

01:20:50.499 --> 01:20:52.855
and tell them that their
murderers will be charged...

01:20:52.940 --> 01:20:54.453
that justice will prevail?

01:20:54.540 --> 01:20:57.771
You force us at gunpoint to
line up and surrender our arms.

01:20:57.861 --> 01:20:59.852
You impound our weapons.

01:20:59.941 --> 01:21:01.215
We're supposed to be allies!

01:21:01.301 --> 01:21:02.813
GANDIN:
Captain Corelli, please!

01:21:04.340 --> 01:21:06.855
We need some kind of assurance.

01:21:09.661 --> 01:21:12.256
I can assure you
that the order to disarm...

01:21:12.342 --> 01:21:14.697
did not come
from my headquarters.

01:21:17.581 --> 01:21:19.971
GANDIN: We have agreed to
the surrender of our arms...

01:21:20.062 --> 01:21:21.575
by noon tomorrow.

01:21:21.662 --> 01:21:24.574
We would like your assurance
that no more of our troops...

01:21:24.662 --> 01:21:28.576
will be forcibly disarmed
before that deadline.

01:21:28.663 --> 01:21:31.779
BARGE: Herr General,
by noon tomorrow...

01:21:31.862 --> 01:21:35.253

you'll be on your way home.

QUARTERMASTER:
This is not our war.

01:21:55.665 --> 01:21:57.781
This is between
the Greeks and the Germans.

01:21:57.865 --> 01:22:00.332
CORELLI: Would you prefer we
left them to fight on their own?

01:22:00.424 --> 01:22:02.222
[Sighs]

01:22:02.305 --> 01:22:04.739
CORELLI: The 4th Regiment
will hold Antisamos.

01:22:04.825 --> 01:22:07.055
We'll keep the 5th
in reserve at Assos...

01:22:07.145 --> 01:22:09.614
and I will take
the 8th and 9th to Argostoli.

[Trucks approaching]

01:23:04.829 --> 01:23:06.468
If we resist now,
we can beat them.

01:23:06.550 --> 01:23:08.461
What if the Germans send planes?

01:23:08.550 --> 01:23:11.507
Don't go near Argostoli.
Stay away from Antisamos Beach.

01:23:11.589 --> 01:23:14.058
I want to lie across the road
so that you can't leave.

01:23:14.150 --> 01:23:17.108
Keep a gun with you
at all times. Promise me.

01:23:19.470 --> 01:23:21.189

your world will stop.

01:34:36.357 --> 01:34:38.313
[Weber gasping]

01:36:15.364 --> 01:36:17.355
He's alive.

01:36:22.045 --> 01:36:23.239
MANDRAS: He's alive.

01:36:23.325 --> 01:36:24.599
[Breathing heavily]

01:36:24.685 --> 01:36:26.642
He was alive when I found him.

01:36:35.966 --> 01:36:38.480
Fragments of uniform
in the bullet holes.

01:36:38.566 --> 01:36:41.035
-Splinters of rib.
-Just do it.

01:36:41.127 --> 01:36:42.765
I am not a surgeon.
I have no penicillin.

01:36:42.847 --> 01:36:43.995
Please!

01:36:44.086 --> 01:36:45.917
I have no sterile water.
No serum.

01:36:46.006 --> 01:36:47.360
Please, Father, do it!

01:37:02.768 --> 01:37:04.679
Hold.

01:37:21.529 --> 01:37:23.998
IANNIS:
Four of his ribs are broken.

01:37:46.371 --> 01:37:48.327
[Gasping]

01:37:48.411 --> 01:37:51.688
Papa! Antonio. Don't move.

01:37:51.772 --> 01:37:53.444
Don't move!

01:37:53.532 --> 01:37:56.170
If you even try to move,
you will haemorrhage to death.

01:37:56.251 --> 01:37:57.730
Uhh!

01:37:57.811 --> 01:37:59.450
No, you must lie still.

01:37:59.532 --> 01:38:04.526
How--I don't--I don't...

01:38:04.612 --> 01:38:08.128
You were lying
under Carlo's body.

01:38:08.213 --> 01:38:12.603
If it wasn't for him,
you wouldn't be alive.

01:38:16.853 --> 01:38:18.844
How did I get here?

01:38:22.534 --> 01:38:24.205
Mandras found you.

01:38:38.094 --> 01:38:43.806
PELAGIA: Antonio, you
should try and drink something.

01:38:43.895 --> 01:38:45.294
Antonio?

01:39:14.217 --> 01:39:17.290
What would you like for lunch?

01:39:17.378 --> 01:39:19.812
Not that there
is any choice, of course.

01:39:19.898 --> 01:39:21.774
But if there was...

01:39:27.538 --> 01:39:35.218
We needed something--
steel, wire--to bind the bones.

01:39:35.298 --> 01:39:40.737
Of course, they'll have to be
removed sometime in the future.

01:39:40.819 --> 01:39:44.937
I could try and get some
new strings from somewhere.

01:39:45.019 --> 01:39:47.090
I could ask around.

01:40:40.223 --> 01:40:41.417
Antonio!

01:40:42.904 --> 01:40:44.576
What are you doing?

01:40:44.664 --> 01:40:46.336
CORELLI: If they find me,
they will shoot you both.

01:40:46.424 --> 01:40:48.300
They'll kill you
if you leave this house.

01:40:48.383 --> 01:40:51.774
I don't belong here, Pelagia!
I never belonged here!

01:40:51.864 --> 01:40:56.335
Ever since I came, look what
has happened all around you.

01:40:56.424 --> 01:40:58.097
I love you.

01:40:58.185 --> 01:40:59.504
I had no right
to make you love me...

01:40:59.585 --> 01:41:01.540
when you weren't mine to love.

01:41:03.184 --> 01:41:04.982
WOMAN: No! Don't do that!

PELAGIA: Lemoni!

01:41:17.985 --> 01:41:19.305
Go to Doctor Iannis's house.

01:41:19.386 --> 01:41:20.535
Go now. Go!

01:42:42.631 --> 01:42:46.591
Dimitris will row you
to a boat out in the bay.

01:42:50.512 --> 01:42:52.947
MANDRAS: You should be home
by tomorrow night.

01:42:57.792 --> 01:42:59.749

We must go.

01:43:31.315 --> 01:43:33.271
[Sobbing]

01:43:42.916 --> 01:43:47.467
I had to see you again.
One last time.

01:43:47.556 --> 01:43:49.195
We must go!

01:43:51.597 --> 01:43:53.268
Pelagia--

01:43:53.356 --> 01:43:55.825
Don't say anything.

01:44:01.997 --> 01:44:03.272
Look at me.

01:44:03.358 --> 01:44:04.586
DIMITRIS: We must go!

01:44:04.678 --> 01:44:06.588
-Go.
-Pelagia.

01:44:06.677 --> 01:44:08.827
Go! Go.

01:44:31.600 --> 01:44:33.556
[Door opens]

01:44:50.920 --> 01:44:54.277
Why did you save him?

01:44:54.361 --> 01:44:56.750
Why didn't you
leave him to die?

01:44:58.961 --> 01:45:01.430
I wanted you
to love me again.

01:45:08.122 --> 01:45:14.756
In Albania, I made them read
every one of these to me.

01:45:14.843 --> 01:45:18.152
"Mandras, I love you.
Mandras, I want you.

01:45:18.242 --> 01:45:21.360
"Mandras, when are you
coming back?"

01:45:25.683 --> 01:45:27.878
And then one day
a different letter.

01:45:33.043 --> 01:45:36.400
"I don't know how
to describe my feelings.

01:45:36.484 --> 01:45:38.520
"It's as if I've been
waiting a hundred years...

"to hear from you.

"Once I thought
my heart was overflowing...

"with love for you.

01:45:49.564 --> 01:45:52.602
"But now all I feel
is emptiness.

01:45:52.685 --> 01:45:57.965
"And I think all the time
it was a pretence...

01:45:58.046 --> 01:46:00.116
"that I never loved you at all."

01:46:21.407 --> 01:46:22.840
I'm sorry.

01:46:28.848 --> 01:46:30.644
I'm sorry.

01:46:48.129 --> 01:46:53.761
IANNIS: The war we thought
would never end is over.

01:46:53.849 --> 01:46:59.560
And the island we thought we
had lost forever is ours again.

01:47:06.810 --> 01:47:11.646
In the doctor's house
there are three of us now...

01:47:11.731 --> 01:47:16.247
the doctor, his daughter...

01:47:16.331 --> 01:47:18.526
who is training
to be a doctor...

01:47:18.611 --> 01:47:20.203
and Lemoni.

01:47:20.291 --> 01:47:22.486
Pelagia! Pelagia!

01:47:25.012 --> 01:47:26.763
It's for you.

01:47:28.011 --> 01:47:29.524
From ltaly.

01:47:51.494 --> 01:47:53.610
LEMONI: What is it?

01:47:57.893 --> 01:47:59.850
It's a record.

[Music stops]

01:48:41.977 --> 01:48:46.255
We should start making supper,
that's what we should do.

01:48:56.178 --> 01:48:59.693
IANNIS:
Antonio, I do not know...

01:48:59.778 --> 01:49:01.928
if this letter
will reach you...

01:49:02.018 --> 01:49:05.534
or even if you are alive.

01:49:05.619 --> 01:49:08.815
Perhaps someone else
sent us your record...

01:49:08.898 --> 01:49:11.538
and that is why
we found no note.

01:49:13.859 --> 01:49:16.737
I would like to say
that Pelagia is happy...

01:49:16.819 --> 01:49:21.097
but she is full of tears
she will not let fall...

01:49:21.179 --> 01:49:26.049
and of a grief
no doctor can mend.

01:49:26.140 --> 01:49:30.292
She blames herself for
the pain we have suffered...

01:49:30.380 --> 01:49:33.453
and perhaps the same
is true for you.

01:49:35.060 --> 01:49:38.815
You know I am not
a religious man...

01:49:38.901 --> 01:49:41.734
but I believe this...

01:49:41.821 --> 01:49:45.895
if there is a wound,
we must try to heal it...

01:49:45.982 --> 01:49:50.099
if there is someone
whose pain we can cure...

01:49:50.181 --> 01:49:53.413
we must search
till we find them...

01:49:53.502 --> 01:49:57.495
if the gods have chosen
that we should survive...

01:49:57.582 --> 01:49:59.538
it will be for a reason.

Where is your miracle
today then, eh?

01:52:57.834 --> 01:53:00.144
What do we have
to say about that?

Fix the roof.

01:53:43.478 --> 01:53:46.356
She's driving me mad.

01:53:46.438 --> 01:53:49.954
When I was deaf,
I couldn't hear her...nagging.

01:53:50.039 --> 01:53:52.188
But now--

01:53:52.278 --> 01:53:56.431
Iatre, I beg of you, help me.

01:53:56.519 --> 01:53:59.238

01:54:42.642 --> 01:54:44.758
I was looking for Lemoni.

01:54:44.842 --> 01:54:47.835
She's down the road.

01:54:47.923 --> 01:54:51.710
I went to the house.

01:54:51.802 --> 01:54:55.239
It doesn't exist anymore.

01:54:55.323 --> 01:54:57.757
We are building a new one.

01:54:59.564 --> 01:55:01.680
Your father wrote
you got the record.

01:55:03.883 --> 01:55:07.763
It's a guitar.
It's different.

01:55:17.045 --> 01:55:19.558
I tried to live without you.

01:55:19.644 --> 01:55:24.799
I tried to make myself believe
I could live without you.

The scar healed well.

Stamatis, do you love your wife?

01:56:04.728 --> 01:56:09.802
If you love your wife,
my advice is be nice to her.

01:56:09.888 --> 01:56:13.325
Bring in the wood
before she asks you for it.

01:56:13.409 --> 01:56:18.722
If she is cold, then put
a shawl around her shoulders.

01:56:18.809 --> 01:56:20.606
And bring her a flower...

01:56:20.689 --> 01:56:23.157
every time you come back
from the field.

back in my ear?
