00:02.711 --> 00:04.671
- Summer, of Girls5eva...
- Yeah.

00:04.713 --> 00:06.214
- Let's talk about your
music career.

00:06.256 --> 00:07.882
Are you a virgin?
- Yes.

00:07.924 --> 00:09.801
I made a promise to myself

00:09.843 --> 00:11.553
and my parents and my God.

00:11.594 --> 00:14.264
It's why I wear
this purity ring.

00:14.305 --> 00:16.266
I want my wedding night
to be special

00:16.307 --> 00:18.268
because we're probably
gonna be in a Hyatt.

00:18.309 --> 00:21.062
- Next up, we ask the guys
of Matchbox Twenty

00:21.104 --> 00:23.273
about singing
and playing instruments.

00:23.314 --> 00:24.399

* 'Cause 4eva's too short *

00:29.988 --> 00:31.239
* It's too short *

00:31.281 --> 00:34.284
* Gonna be famous 3gether *

00:34.326 --> 00:38.121
* 'Cause that's 1 more
than 2gether *

00:38.163 --> 00:41.082
* Gonna be famous 5eva *

00:41.124 --> 00:43.668
* 'Cause 4eva's too short *

00:43.710 --> 00:46.671

00:46.713 --> 00:50.842
* Girls5eva *

00:53.219 --> 00:55.430
- Ugh!

00:55.472 --> 00:57.807
Your shower makes me smell
like tap water.

00:57.849 --> 00:59.225
- What? You got a big date?

00:59.267 --> 01:02.145
- I cannot disclose the size
of the man I'm meeting.

01:02.187 --> 01:04.773
I signed an NDA
with "The NBA on TNT."

01:04.814 --> 01:08.777
- Oh. Well, that's how most
great love stories start.

01:08.818 --> 01:10.820
- Dawn, remember
when I made a promise

01:10.862 --> 01:12.280
that I would always tell you
when your clothes

01:12.322 --> 01:13.615
disappointed me?
- No.

01:13.657 --> 01:14.949
- You weren't there,
but I made a promise.

01:14.991 --> 01:16.951
What are those?

01:16.993 --> 01:18.203
- Oh, my sheers.

01:18.244 --> 01:19.788
What, you don't have TV pants

01:19.829 --> 01:22.332
where you put in so many
ass hours they're kinda clear?

01:22.374 --> 01:24.334
Scott, start it.

01:24.376 --> 01:26.461
- Enjoy your
crushing mundanity.

01:26.503 --> 01:28.755
Just sitting there,
reeking of tap water.

01:33.968 --> 01:35.303
<i>Happy birthday, son.</i>

01:35.345 --> 01:36.471
- They're so terrible

01:36.513 --> 01:39.057
in beautiful places.

01:39.099 --> 01:42.143
- The only thing left
is Brown Mountain Bold Squeeze?

01:42.185 --> 01:43.853
Come on, guys.
- Morning, ladies.

01:43.895 --> 01:44.896
- Hello.
- Hey.

01:44.938 --> 01:46.356
- How do you all feel
about a box

01:46.398 --> 01:48.733
to kick your trainers against?
- Okay.

01:48.775 --> 01:50.485
- I like an assignment,
personally,

01:50.527 --> 01:52.320
'cause if there's no box,
I'm just kicking air,

01:52.362 --> 01:53.488
and what's
that all about, right?

01:53.530 --> 01:55.657
- What are you saying?
- Tate's email.

01:55.699 --> 01:57.909
The label is hoping
the album can have a love song.

01:57.951 --> 01:59.119
- I'm not gonna write them
a love song

01:59.160 --> 02:00.328
'cause they ask for it.
- No.

02:00.370 --> 02:02.288
- You know, something raw
and achingly true

02:02.330 --> 02:04.165
that can one day
be in a Super Bowl ad

02:04.207 --> 02:06.126
where a lady likes
a travel website.

02:06.167 --> 02:07.335
- Well, they came
to the right place,

02:07.377 --> 02:08.545
because I can't do anything

02:08.586 --> 02:11.339
without bringing sex
to the table.

02:11.381 --> 02:13.633
[chuckles]

02:13.675 --> 02:15.593
- I'm bringing the heat too.

02:15.635 --> 02:18.263
Caroline and I are back in biz.

02:18.304 --> 02:20.515
- I did stuff last night too.
- Really?

02:20.557 --> 02:22.392
- What? Wait, with who?

02:22.434 --> 02:24.269
What base?
Why am I being so aggressive?

02:24.310 --> 02:26.271
- Okay. His name is Liam,

02:26.312 --> 02:28.690
and we met
on Christian Kringle.

02:28.732 --> 02:31.693
It's a dating site
for Christians who love Santa.

02:31.735 --> 02:34.029
I can't say
that it was the best date.

02:34.070 --> 02:36.698
I had fun. [chuckles]

02:36.740 --> 02:37.866
- Me too.

02:37.907 --> 02:39.242
- Oh.

02:40.744 --> 02:44.914
[moaning]

02:44.956 --> 02:46.374
Oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry.

02:46.416 --> 02:49.753
It's just--it's been
a really long time.

02:50.795 --> 02:54.299
But then we went inside
and had...

02:54.341 --> 02:56.051
[whispering] Sex.

02:56.092 --> 02:57.969
Yeah, it wasn't magical.

02:58.011 --> 02:59.554
I didn't see fireworks.

02:59.596 --> 03:01.056
- Still, I'm proud of you
for trying.

03:01.097 --> 03:02.390
- Thanks.

03:02.432 --> 03:04.225
- Summer, if I could give you
some advice

03:04.267 --> 03:05.226
from my own life...

03:05.268 --> 03:06.436
- Oh.
- I cannot.

03:06.478 --> 03:08.646
I signed an NDA
with "The NBA on TNT,"

03:08.688 --> 03:12.359
but know that
it would've been magnificent.

03:12.400 --> 03:15.487
- Oh, Wickie, thank you.
- You're welcome.

03:17.155 --> 03:20.033
[novelty car horn playing]

03:21.785 --> 03:25.080
- Oh, my God!
Mommy and Daddy?

03:25.121 --> 03:26.539
- Surprise!
- [laughs]

03:26.581 --> 03:28.708
- Surprise!
- We surprised her!

03:28.750 --> 03:30.710
A mama knows
a baby's surprise face.

03:30.752 --> 03:33.129
- I'm so surprised.
What are you doing here?

03:33.171 --> 03:36.216
- Well, we rerouted
our ministry tour to come by

03:36.257 --> 03:37.467
and check in on our baby.

03:37.509 --> 03:39.928
Plus, there's an Annie Sez
in Passaic

03:39.969 --> 03:43.014
that's got a sale
on inspirational denim, so...

03:43.056 --> 03:45.392
- How's my little girl
holding up after the big split?

03:45.433 --> 03:46.851
- I'm good. Thanks.

03:46.893 --> 03:48.520
- Good, good.
Well, you know what?

03:48.561 --> 03:50.105
We didn't wanna show up
empty-handed,

03:50.146 --> 03:52.273
and now that the house
has more room in it...

03:52.315 --> 03:53.733
- We thought we'd bring you

03:53.775 --> 03:56.319
your old
Little Baby Ladies collection.

03:56.361 --> 03:58.530
- [laughs]
- [laughs] Ah!

03:58.571 --> 03:59.906
- And don't worry.
They're still in mint condish.

03:59.948 --> 04:01.950
We didn't want the value
to go down.

04:01.992 --> 04:05.537
- That's so nice
that you guys are here.

04:05.578 --> 04:08.957
Kev took Stevia to Las Vegas
to tour hype houses.

04:08.999 --> 04:10.625
So yeah...

04:10.667 --> 04:12.293
I'm all alone.
- Oh.

04:12.335 --> 04:14.254
- Let me help you
with your luggage, Daddy.

04:14.295 --> 04:15.755
- No, I got it.
This one's heavy,

04:15.797 --> 04:17.173
'cause it's all thumb rings.

04:17.215 --> 04:18.675
- Oh.
- [laughs]

04:18.717 --> 04:20.719
- Yeah, okay.
- Oh, you are blessed.

04:20.760 --> 04:23.179
- And then I just put
everything in a big bowl,

04:23.221 --> 04:24.848
and I mix it up.

04:24.889 --> 04:26.349
And it doesn't even matter
which way you stir.

04:26.391 --> 04:27.976
- [laughs]

04:28.018 --> 04:29.060
- Well, look at you.

04:29.102 --> 04:31.646
You're cooking salads,
making music,

04:31.688 --> 04:33.606
offering to carry bags.

04:33.648 --> 04:35.275
You are thrivin' and arrivin'.

04:35.316 --> 04:36.985
- Thank you.

04:37.027 --> 04:39.487
- Now, honey,
your mom and I know

04:39.529 --> 04:41.573
this has been
a tough season for you.

04:41.614 --> 04:43.325
We all thought Kev was it.

04:43.366 --> 04:45.660
But sometimes
the big man shanks it.

04:45.702 --> 04:49.456
- I know. I really thought
Kev was the one.

04:49.497 --> 04:51.124
- Well, your mom and I are here

04:51.166 --> 04:54.002
to get you onto the path
to finding the two.

04:54.044 --> 04:57.005
- We just want you to be
as happy as we are.

04:57.047 --> 04:58.006
both: Muah!

04:58.048 --> 04:59.382
- Yep. Happy as clams.

04:59.424 --> 05:01.176
- Oh, an animal God got right.

05:01.217 --> 05:03.136
No notes!

05:03.178 --> 05:07.557
- Well, what you guys have
is what I want, obvs.

05:07.599 --> 05:09.809
- Well, good,
because in the early '90s,

05:09.851 --> 05:12.687
I took a vow to protect
your purity until marriage.

05:12.729 --> 05:15.148
And now you are
once again unmarried.

05:15.190 --> 05:19.194
So it looks like Daddy
is back on the job.

05:19.235 --> 05:20.862
Huh! Hah!
- [laughs]

05:20.904 --> 05:21.905
You are too much.

05:21.946 --> 05:23.740
- So, Summer,

05:23.782 --> 05:25.533
until you find the two,

05:25.575 --> 05:28.953
would you be willing
to keep it chaste

05:28.995 --> 05:30.455
below the waist?

05:30.497 --> 05:32.332
<i>[quirky music]</i>

05:32.374 --> 05:34.793
- Wow, y'all.

05:34.834 --> 05:36.127
Wow.

05:40.006 --> 05:41.883
- * Tonight is the night *

05:41.925 --> 05:44.928
* That only happens tonight *

05:44.969 --> 05:48.973
* Tomorrow is just
yesterday's tonight *

05:50.266 --> 05:52.394
- If you don't need anything,
I'm gonna head out.

05:52.435 --> 05:54.229
I found this
single slab coaster

05:54.270 --> 05:58.066
I think I can save
if I plant it tonight.

05:58.108 --> 06:00.610
- There's been, like,
10 billion love songs.

06:00.652 --> 06:04.072
The Beatles just got to be
like, "Love me do."

06:04.114 --> 06:05.824
It's easy
when you get to go first

06:05.865 --> 06:07.867
and then just ski around
for a whole movie.

06:07.909 --> 06:10.036
- Dawn, you need a brain break.

06:11.287 --> 06:12.747
Okay.

06:12.789 --> 06:16.001
What do you do when you want
to just turn off the noise?

06:16.042 --> 06:17.919
- I don't know.

06:17.961 --> 06:20.463
Drink red wine out of a mug.

06:20.505 --> 06:22.424
- Okay. Let's do that, then.

06:22.465 --> 06:24.759
Uhh...oh.

06:24.801 --> 06:27.595
There is Brown Mountain Merlot.

06:27.637 --> 06:29.431
- Is it gonna be hot?

06:31.349 --> 06:34.936
- We could do a small little
vow thing right here on Sunday.

06:34.978 --> 06:37.063
- It's vital
that we protect your purity

06:37.105 --> 06:38.648
during this vulnerable time.

06:38.690 --> 06:40.942
I mean, you're a divorcee,

06:40.984 --> 06:43.737
and, well, that sounds French.

06:43.778 --> 06:44.863
- I know it does.

06:44.904 --> 06:46.614
- And you're now
a internet villain.

06:46.656 --> 06:47.949
So the temptation to do bad

06:47.991 --> 06:49.743
is gonna be
very hard to resist.

06:49.784 --> 06:51.453
And if you think your mother
and I didn't notice

06:51.494 --> 06:54.080
those lowlights,
think again, missy.

06:54.122 --> 06:55.582
- No--don't get me wrong.

06:55.623 --> 06:57.500
The ring is very beautiful,

06:57.542 --> 07:00.045
and I do need something
to balance my hand out.

07:00.086 --> 07:01.212
It's just--
- Excuse me.

07:01.254 --> 07:02.589
Do you have parents
on your feet?

07:02.630 --> 07:04.591
'Cause we're up here.
- What'd you do, baby-lady?

07:05.592 --> 07:07.052
- I did...

07:10.347 --> 07:11.348
It.

07:11.389 --> 07:13.266
- Oh, my Lord!

07:13.308 --> 07:16.144
Oh, my Lord.
Oh, show me his face!

07:16.186 --> 07:18.146
No, I can't. I can't do it.
I can't do it.

07:18.188 --> 07:19.814
I can't do it.
No, I wanna see it.

07:19.856 --> 07:21.149
Okay, let me see it.
I'll squint.

07:21.191 --> 07:25.278
- His name is Liam.
- Liam, huh?

07:25.320 --> 07:27.322
More like a "Lie-am."
- Oh.

07:27.364 --> 07:29.449
- He's got a empty
earring hole.

07:29.491 --> 07:30.825
That means secrets.

07:30.867 --> 07:32.452
He is not the two,

07:32.494 --> 07:34.579
and you'd have known that
if you'd have made him

07:34.621 --> 07:36.539
wait 11 months
to touch your shoulder.

glamorous location.

07:44.673 --> 07:47.634
- How was your date
with obviously Shaq?

07:47.676 --> 07:49.928
- I cannot confirm nor deny
the thing I want you to know,

07:49.969 --> 07:52.514
but cannot say.

07:52.555 --> 07:54.683
[sighs]

07:54.724 --> 07:56.351
But what I can say

07:56.393 --> 07:58.353
is we had a meet-cute
at the Atlanta Airport,

07:58.395 --> 08:01.648
and I saw him, and I said,
"Are you 'name redacted'?"

08:01.690 --> 08:04.234
And he said,
"Of course I'm 'name redacted.'

08:04.275 --> 08:07.737
Who else do you know
that's seven-foot-'redacted'?"

08:07.779 --> 08:08.947
Where were you?

08:08.989 --> 08:10.949
- I was working.
You're welcome.

08:10.991 --> 08:12.409
- Did you and Ray
crack the song?

08:12.450 --> 08:14.119

this purity stuff

12:37.882 --> 12:39.050

January 1982,

So why did you make me wait?
