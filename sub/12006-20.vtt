What's going on?

00:05.018 --> 00:07.759
_

00:09.713 --> 00:11.314
Don't follow me.

00:11.348 --> 00:12.481
I can hook you guys up with some coke.

00:12.516 --> 00:14.350
- Have you done this before?
- No, no, no,

00:14.384 --> 00:17.119
but this is good. This is really good.

00:17.154 --> 00:20.022
Daphne, I'm trying to get
through this, just like you.

00:20.057 --> 00:22.058
You really want to know how my trip was?

00:22.092 --> 00:23.125
Yeah.

00:23.160 --> 00:25.194
I got very high.

00:25.229 --> 00:27.863
You know what? You are not the
only one going through stuff,

00:27.898 --> 00:29.865
so stop acting like a little brat.

00:31.935 --> 00:33.169
Look, if you're really pissed at your ma,

00:33.203 --> 00:34.904
and you need her to know,
then you gotta show her.

00:38.075 --> 00:41.010
I can't believe I just
did that. I'm on probation.

00:41.044 --> 00:42.044
A bad girl, huh?

00:50.687 --> 00:51.921
I'm just really worried about her.

- You need to sit down.

01:13.277 --> 01:15.478
Is it true?

01:15.512 --> 01:17.013
You did cocaine?

01:18.415 --> 01:20.182
Thank you.

01:20.217 --> 01:22.018
Bay was right to tell us.

01:22.052 --> 01:24.086
- What were you thinking?
- Clearly, she wasn't.

01:24.121 --> 01:26.856
I did it one time and I hated it.

01:26.890 --> 01:28.791
And I will never do it again, okay?

01:28.825 --> 01:30.793
No, it's not okay... the
fact that you did it one time

01:30.827 --> 01:32.795
- and snuck behind our backs...
- My mom knew.

01:32.829 --> 01:34.130
- Why didn't you tell us?
- What the hell is she talking about?

01:34.164 --> 01:35.831
Hold on.

01:35.866 --> 01:38.734
You told me you got high.
I assumed you meant pot.

01:38.769 --> 01:40.703
Oh, so pot's okay with you?

01:40.737 --> 01:42.705
Sweetheart, we know

01:42.739 --> 01:45.508
that you've been going through a
tough time these past few weeks,

01:45.542 --> 01:47.510
but drugs are not the answer.

01:47.544 --> 01:48.811
I said it won't happen again.

01:53.450 --> 01:55.518
Bay said that you shoved her.

01:55.612 --> 01:56.779
What is that about?

01:56.813 --> 02:00.316
She is exaggerating. I barely touched her.

02:00.350 --> 02:01.417
You pushed me.

02:01.451 --> 02:04.253
Because you wouldn't
mind your own business.

02:04.287 --> 02:06.288
I'm not the one who's
hanging around with that loser

02:06.323 --> 02:08.324
who threw a brick through Regina's window.

02:08.358 --> 02:09.392
- What?
- Who?

02:09.425 --> 02:13.229
Some guy named Nacho from East Riverside.

02:13.296 --> 02:15.331
Nacho Rivera?

02:15.365 --> 02:18.100
He threw the brick? And
now you're seeing him?

02:18.135 --> 02:20.970
Seriously? Are you that mad at me?

02:21.004 --> 02:23.139
- What's she mad at you for?
- Take your pick...

02:23.206 --> 02:25.841
that she's in business with Chip Coto,

02:25.876 --> 02:28.110
or that she pulled a gun on me.

02:28.145 --> 02:29.678
- What?
- Oh my God, a gun?

02:29.713 --> 02:30.946
- It was an accident.
- Okay, wait.

02:30.981 --> 02:34.049
The gun I knew about, but Chip Coto?

02:34.084 --> 02:36.619
- You knew?
- How could you be so careless?

02:36.653 --> 02:39.688
It was late at night at K&D.
I wasn't expecting anybody.

02:39.723 --> 02:42.491
Look, the gun is gone. I got rid of it.

02:42.526 --> 02:43.726
Wait a second. Where do
you think you're going?

02:43.760 --> 02:46.462
- I have to go to school.
- Okay, we'll finish later.

02:46.496 --> 02:48.697
But as of right now, you
are grounded indefinitely.

02:48.732 --> 02:51.467
School, the clinic, home... that's it.

02:51.501 --> 02:52.501
Whatever.

02:52.536 --> 02:54.403
That goes for prom too.

02:54.438 --> 02:57.373
It doesn't matter. I
don't want to go anyway.

Oh, no. I'm sorry.

It's been a rough morning.

03:41.640 --> 03:42.970
_

03:43.386 --> 03:45.454
I just hope that I did the right thing.

03:45.489 --> 03:47.990
I love it, really.

03:48.024 --> 03:51.026
And the best part is, if the dance sucks,

03:51.061 --> 03:53.262
we can always do the crossword.

04:27.063 --> 04:29.031
What are they doing?

04:29.065 --> 04:31.166
Okay, everyone, gather round.

04:31.201 --> 04:34.203
We're about to announce
your prom king and queen.

04:34.237 --> 04:35.437
<i>Bay: Ooh, exciting.</i>

04:35.472 --> 04:38.240
Let's see who the prettiest, most popular,

04:38.275 --> 04:41.143
most superficial couple in the school is.

04:42.279 --> 04:44.980
(Cheering and applause)

04:47.851 --> 04:48.981
_

04:51.121 --> 04:53.837
- This is a joke, right?
- _

04:53.838 --> 04:55.291
- It's a big honor.
- Yeah, totally.

04:55.325 --> 04:57.026
How did this happen?

04:57.027 --> 05:01.031
_

05:01.398 --> 05:04.233
Emmett, I don't... I mean, thank you,

05:04.267 --> 05:07.937
but I don't want to be prom queen.

05:10.832 --> 05:12.690
_

05:12.692 --> 05:13.943
And I'll be king.

05:16.079 --> 05:17.079
(Cheers and applause)

05:17.113 --> 05:19.048
Okay, pipe down. Pipe down, everybody.

05:19.049 --> 05:22.583
_

05:22.584 --> 05:24.860
_

05:24.988 --> 05:26.388
Yeah. No. Yes, totally.

05:26.423 --> 05:30.159
We want our titles. Prom king and queen...

05:30.193 --> 05:33.228
- That's us.
- (Cheering and applause)

05:33.263 --> 05:36.198
All right, get to class.
Everyone, go, all of you.

05:39.035 --> 05:42.037
Now most girls would kill for this.

05:43.340 --> 05:45.207
What's this about Chip Coto?

05:45.241 --> 05:47.142
What kind of message are you sending,
working with that son of a bitch?

05:47.177 --> 05:49.411
It wasn't my call. It was Wes'.

05:49.446 --> 05:52.348
But there is no East
Riverside project without Coto.

05:52.382 --> 05:54.283
Oh, so the project is more
important than our daughter?

05:54.317 --> 05:57.252
I am sure Regina didn't realize

05:57.287 --> 05:59.388
this was gonna set Daphne off like this.

05:59.422 --> 06:01.056
Yeah, well, it set me off.

06:01.091 --> 06:03.225
John, Daphne is in trouble.

06:03.259 --> 06:04.994
We have to all be on the same page here.

06:05.028 --> 06:07.096
I know. I know.

06:09.265 --> 06:11.033
I'm sure you need to get to work.

06:11.067 --> 06:12.234
Work can wait.

06:12.268 --> 06:14.036
Daphne's in school.

06:14.070 --> 06:16.405
Just take a few hours for yourself.

06:16.439 --> 06:18.073
<i>She's right.</i>

06:18.108 --> 06:19.308
We can regroup later, make a plan.

06:21.177 --> 06:22.277
Okay.

06:30.053 --> 06:32.254
I think Daphne should see a therapist.

06:32.288 --> 06:33.355
What?

06:33.390 --> 06:35.424
Wallowing in this is not
gonna help her right now.

06:35.458 --> 06:39.294
Therapy is not wallowing.
It's emotional support.

06:39.329 --> 06:41.397
She needs time to work through all this.

06:41.431 --> 06:43.198
Okay, maybe,

06:43.233 --> 06:45.167
but she is graduating in a couple of weeks,

06:45.201 --> 06:46.168
and she hasn't even decided

06:46.202 --> 06:48.103
which college she's going to yet.

06:48.138 --> 06:49.972
She needs to take control of her life

06:50.006 --> 06:51.206
and focus on the future.

06:51.241 --> 06:55.010
I really feel that is the
best way for her to move on.

07:00.050 --> 07:01.016
(Sighs)

07:01.051 --> 07:04.720
- Daphne.
- Hey, Dr. J.

07:04.754 --> 07:06.855
I was so sorry to hear about Angelo.

07:06.890 --> 07:08.791
He seemed like a really good man.

07:08.825 --> 07:10.526
Thanks.

07:10.560 --> 07:12.494
We weren't expecting you back so soon.

07:12.529 --> 07:14.363
I'm fine.

07:14.397 --> 07:15.831
If anything, I could use the distraction.

07:15.865 --> 07:17.599
You know, when my wife died,

07:17.634 --> 07:19.601
everything seemed to remind me of her.

07:19.636 --> 07:21.403
I don't know if it's
the same with your dad...

07:21.438 --> 07:22.705
I'm fine, really.

07:22.739 --> 07:24.506
I should get to work.

07:31.147 --> 07:32.347
Hey, Your Highness.

07:32.382 --> 07:35.317
Not sure... should I bow or curtsey?

07:35.351 --> 07:37.319
There was obviously low voter turnout.

07:37.353 --> 07:39.221
Trust me, there are some girls at Buckner

07:39.255 --> 07:41.290
who are probably dying of
laughter right about now.

07:41.324 --> 07:43.225
Hey, if you can't beat 'em, join 'em.

07:43.259 --> 07:45.994
- You got a prom date?
- No. It's cool.

07:46.029 --> 07:47.229
I'd rather go solo anyway,

07:47.263 --> 07:50.132
so I can dance my booty off.

07:50.166 --> 07:51.867
Is it true Daphne's not coming?

07:51.901 --> 07:54.036
Yeah, she's facing major groundage.

07:54.070 --> 07:55.738
That sucks.

07:55.772 --> 07:57.740
Well, see you at the coronation.

08:02.781 --> 08:03.813
_

08:03.814 --> 08:10.036
_

08:15.300 --> 08:16.430
_

08:17.694 --> 08:18.861
What email?

08:22.826 --> 08:27.299
_

08:28.520 --> 08:32.042
_

08:32.058 --> 08:33.207
What?

08:34.520 --> 08:35.716
_

08:36.246 --> 08:37.312
It's archaic.

08:37.347 --> 08:40.282
People should be able to
wear whatever they want.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.280
_

08:44.282 --> 08:47.492
_

08:47.495 --> 08:49.291
I haven't worn a dress since I was two.

08:49.942 --> 08:52.330
_

08:52.335 --> 08:54.163
That's like asking you to wear a tutu.

08:54.197 --> 08:55.898
I'd feel stupid.

08:57.360 --> 08:58.709
_

09:01.037 --> 09:02.137
What does this mean?

09:02.585 --> 09:04.536
_

09:05.176 --> 09:07.718
_

09:07.719 --> 09:10.896
_

09:10.897 --> 09:12.377
_

09:12.949 --> 09:13.916
Natalie, wait.

09:15.057 --> 09:17.371
_

09:17.372 --> 09:20.367
_

09:20.568 --> 09:23.910
_

09:30.567 --> 09:32.668
Need some help here! Need some help here!

09:32.702 --> 09:35.370
Wait, no, no, no, no.
We're not an urgent care.

09:35.405 --> 09:36.572
He's bleeding.

09:36.606 --> 09:38.273
Dr. J.!

09:38.308 --> 09:40.142
- What happened?
- He blew through a red light.

09:40.176 --> 09:41.443
I had to swerve to avoid hitting him.

09:41.477 --> 09:43.178
He laid his bike down pretty hard.

09:43.246 --> 09:44.379
Someone call 911.

09:44.414 --> 09:47.015
- And get me some gauze.
- Man: Right away.

09:47.050 --> 09:49.017
- Are you hurt anywhere else?
- I don't think so.

09:49.052 --> 09:51.320
<i>The wound's pretty deep. You had a
tetanus shot in the past 10 years?</i>

09:51.354 --> 09:53.355
<i>- Victim: No.
- Dr. J: Daphne.</i>

09:53.389 --> 09:55.991
Daphne. Daphne!

09:56.025 --> 09:58.794
Go to the drug lockup, get me
a tetanus vial and a syringe.

10:27.153 --> 10:30.289
No, of course I'm thrilled.
I'm just not that excitable.

10:30.323 --> 10:33.058
Hey, let me know once you
hear from the bank, okay?

10:33.093 --> 10:34.159
Mahalo.

10:34.194 --> 10:36.361
Hi.

10:36.396 --> 10:38.363
Hi. Good news?

10:38.398 --> 10:41.100
Yeah, we're putting
together a project in Maui.

10:41.134 --> 10:42.234
Hawaii?

10:42.268 --> 10:43.936
Lucky you.

10:43.970 --> 10:46.138
You have the tile samples too?

10:46.172 --> 10:48.807
Uh, yeah, somewhere.

10:50.009 --> 10:51.944
Where's the food court interior?

10:51.978 --> 10:53.645
It's not there?

10:53.680 --> 10:56.849
No, just the entry and the restrooms.

10:56.883 --> 10:59.051
Oh, I must've left it on the kitchen table,

10:59.085 --> 11:01.553
right next to the tile samples.

11:01.588 --> 11:03.722
I'm so sorry. I... I will go get it.

11:03.757 --> 11:06.859
No no no no. Hey hey, it's okay.

11:06.893 --> 11:09.795
Is everything all right?

11:09.829 --> 11:11.630
It's... it's Daphne.

11:11.664 --> 11:14.366
We're still having issues.

11:14.400 --> 11:17.536
But that's home, and this is work.

11:17.570 --> 11:20.272
Look, I'm not criticizing.

11:20.306 --> 11:22.608
It must be hard being a
single parent all these years.

11:22.642 --> 11:24.676
I mean, I know I couldn't do it.

11:24.711 --> 11:29.448
Thanks, but I'm not doing a
very good job of it right now.

11:29.482 --> 11:31.517
Oh, no, no. You're just...
you're having a bad day.

11:31.551 --> 11:33.519
You need to shake it off.

11:33.553 --> 11:35.354
You want an iced coffee, a frozen yogurt?

11:35.388 --> 11:37.389
I can send Jess to get us anything.

11:37.423 --> 11:39.992
I'm... I'm okay.

11:44.063 --> 11:46.165
I got some good news
that might cheer you up.

11:48.334 --> 11:51.036
My security team located an A.T.M. camera

11:51.070 --> 11:52.805
across the street from the project.

11:52.839 --> 11:54.740
There's footage from the
night we got vandalized.

11:54.774 --> 11:56.875
- Do they know who did it?
- Well, they're working on it.

11:56.910 --> 11:59.011
With technology these
days, I like our chances.

11:59.045 --> 12:02.681
You're right. That does help.

12:03.883 --> 12:05.617
We're gonna get these guys.

12:08.618 --> 12:10.562
_

12:20.767 --> 12:21.733
Hey.

12:23.454 --> 12:27.414
_

12:28.374 --> 12:29.575
It's really sweet.

12:33.110 --> 12:41.038
_

12:43.729 --> 12:47.297
_

12:48.198 --> 12:50.110
_

12:50.864 --> 12:51.897
I'm sorry, Natalie.

12:54.858 --> 12:55.913
_

13:25.531 --> 13:28.233
Honey. Hi.

13:28.268 --> 13:30.402
Hey. Hey, Kathryn.

13:30.436 --> 13:32.571
- How was the clinic?
- It was fine.

13:32.605 --> 13:35.440
- Was it nice to be back?
- It's work.

13:35.475 --> 13:38.043
Wait.

13:38.077 --> 13:40.145
I want to talk to you about next year.

13:40.179 --> 13:42.981
You have Gallaudet waiting for an answer.

13:43.016 --> 13:45.117
What about Northwestern?

13:45.151 --> 13:48.253
When are you gonna hear from them?

13:48.288 --> 13:49.888
I won't be.

13:49.923 --> 13:51.156
Why not?

13:51.190 --> 13:53.792
Because I never applied.

13:53.826 --> 13:55.861
I thought it was your dream school.

13:55.895 --> 13:57.729
What about their pre-med program?

13:57.764 --> 13:59.698
I changed my mind.

13:59.732 --> 14:00.933
Daphne...

14:06.639 --> 14:09.641
Yes, I mix my own stuff, but I
also, you know, take requests...

14:09.676 --> 14:11.476
whatever the people want, you know?

14:11.544 --> 14:14.680
Ask and ye shall receive, right?

14:14.714 --> 14:17.482
Okay, wait. Let me at
least send you my demo tape.

14:17.517 --> 14:19.484
Wait... hello?

14:21.487 --> 14:23.755
'Sup, Skrillex Junior?

14:23.790 --> 14:27.359
I just got rejected for a
pre-prom party at the Disco Bowl

14:27.393 --> 14:29.361
'cause I don't have enough experience.

14:29.395 --> 14:30.495
Sucks, dude.

14:30.530 --> 14:32.397
Yeah, you know, it's that old thing...

14:32.432 --> 14:34.466
you need a good gig to get a good gig.

14:34.500 --> 14:37.169
I have to figure out a way
to get my name out there.

14:37.203 --> 14:40.272
Crazy idea... flyers.

14:40.306 --> 14:43.342
Paper? Have you lost your mind?!

14:43.376 --> 14:45.110
Well, no, hear me out.

14:45.144 --> 14:47.179
I read that looking at
stuff just on screens

14:47.213 --> 14:49.081
actually inhibits reading comprehension.

14:49.115 --> 14:51.049
Now parchment... that's what you need.

14:51.084 --> 14:54.052
You know, there's activity boards
all over campus. We could paper them.

14:54.087 --> 14:56.054
Okay.

14:56.089 --> 14:58.924
I mean, I'm sure I can
throw something together.

14:58.958 --> 15:01.860
Clip art is still a thing, right?

15:01.894 --> 15:03.729
No no no no. Hang on.

15:03.763 --> 15:05.864
I, my friend, am in art class.

15:05.898 --> 15:08.700
I will draw you your very own killer logo.

15:08.735 --> 15:11.436
Are you sure? I mean, that
sounds like a lot of work.

15:11.471 --> 15:13.805
Nah, it'd be my pleasure. What
are your feelings on dragons?

15:13.840 --> 15:15.774
'Cause I've gotten really good at those.

15:15.808 --> 15:17.642
Awesome. Thank you very much.

15:50.109 --> 15:52.878
<i>(Garbage disposal whirrs)</i>

15:59.886 --> 16:02.621
Are you coming out, or do
I have to come in there?

16:02.655 --> 16:05.524
<i>(Door closes)</i>

16:05.558 --> 16:07.459
<i>(Regina gasps)</i>

16:11.931 --> 16:13.832
I love it.

16:13.866 --> 16:16.501
Thanks. Me too.

16:20.740 --> 16:22.607
I have to admit, when I first found out

16:22.642 --> 16:25.410
I was prom queen, I was pretty freaked.

16:25.445 --> 16:27.279
And now?

16:27.313 --> 16:28.513
Honestly?

16:28.548 --> 16:32.084
I'm kind of excited.
Does that make me shallow?

16:32.118 --> 16:34.052
Not at all.

16:34.087 --> 16:36.188
I had the best time at my senior prom,

16:36.222 --> 16:38.290
the corsage, the photos... everything.

16:38.324 --> 16:40.225
It's timeless. Step up.

16:46.833 --> 16:48.200
Thanks for doing this.

16:48.234 --> 16:50.769
Of course.

16:50.803 --> 16:55.006
I know we've had a lot
going on lately with Daphne,

16:55.041 --> 16:57.976
but you deserve a special night.

16:59.078 --> 17:01.913
Every kid deserves a great prom.

17:05.917 --> 17:08.653
So they made this policy at school

17:08.688 --> 17:10.821
that girls have to dress like girls

17:10.857 --> 17:12.723
and boys have to dress like boys,

17:12.758 --> 17:15.460
whatever that means.
Otherwise they can't go in.

17:15.494 --> 17:17.662
Really? In this day and age?

17:17.696 --> 17:20.632
And my friend Natalie wanted to
go with her girlfriend Hilary,

17:20.665 --> 17:22.634
who dresses like a boy.

17:22.667 --> 17:24.569
She won't wear a dress, like, ever.

17:24.604 --> 17:26.471
So they're not gonna go?

17:26.506 --> 17:28.286
Nope.

17:28.290 --> 17:30.125
Which makes me feel super guilty,

17:30.159 --> 17:33.996
because I have, like, this privilege
of going in in what I want to wear.

17:34.030 --> 17:36.198
I don't have to fight for
my right to be who I am.

17:39.035 --> 17:42.771
That was one thing about Angelo...

17:42.805 --> 17:45.674
he couldn't stand people
being cruel to others.

17:45.708 --> 17:48.010
He always stood up for the underdog.

17:51.848 --> 17:53.749
Well, Hilary tried.

17:53.783 --> 17:55.751
She got a bunch of
people to sign a petition,

17:55.785 --> 17:58.921
but Principal Rose said that there
was nothing she could do about it.

17:58.955 --> 18:00.856
The dress code comes
from the school district.

18:00.890 --> 18:04.426
What if the queen has
something to say about it?

18:04.460 --> 18:06.628
I'm prom queen, not the Queen of England.

18:06.663 --> 18:09.631
Still, a public figure of sorts.

18:09.666 --> 18:12.367
The best leaders lead by example.

18:26.841 --> 18:28.608
There you are.

18:30.578 --> 18:32.479
Is everything okay?

18:32.513 --> 18:34.714
The drug lockup came up short yesterday.

18:34.749 --> 18:37.584
A bottle of oxycodone is missing.

18:37.618 --> 18:39.452
Oh?

18:39.487 --> 18:42.422
Turns out the only people who
had access to it were you and me.

18:42.456 --> 18:44.457
Someone must have miscounted.

18:44.492 --> 18:46.259
That's doubtful.

18:46.294 --> 18:48.328
We're required by law
to keep strict records

18:48.362 --> 18:50.330
of all dispensed controlled substances.

18:50.364 --> 18:54.000
No oxycodone was prescribed
yesterday, nor the day before.

18:55.369 --> 18:58.004
Did you take it?

19:03.945 --> 19:06.179
I did. And I'm so sorry.

19:06.214 --> 19:08.048
I know it was a stupid thing to do.

19:08.082 --> 19:09.082
I'm so sorry.

19:09.116 --> 19:10.150
Why?

19:10.184 --> 19:12.953
I... I don't know.

19:12.987 --> 19:16.823
I didn't even want them. I just...

19:16.857 --> 19:18.792
I got freaked out

19:18.826 --> 19:20.760
by that guy from the accident,

19:20.795 --> 19:22.963
and when I saw the pills...

19:24.732 --> 19:26.800
I flushed them down the sink

19:26.834 --> 19:28.868
as soon as I got home, I swear.

19:30.905 --> 19:32.872
I'm partly to blame.

19:32.907 --> 19:35.408
I broke protocol by giving you the keys.

19:35.443 --> 19:37.677
I will never do anything like that again...

19:39.513 --> 19:40.614
ever.

19:40.648 --> 19:42.549
I know you're going
through a lot right now,

19:42.583 --> 19:45.552
and I empathize, but I
can't tolerate stealing.

19:45.586 --> 19:49.189
- I know.
- I have to let you go.

19:51.492 --> 19:54.494
Please, just give me another chance.

19:54.528 --> 19:56.529
I'll make it up to you.
I'll work extra shifts...

19:56.564 --> 19:59.165
anything.

19:59.200 --> 20:01.301
You crossed a line.

20:19.704 --> 20:20.837

20:28.579 --> 20:30.780

20:43.628 --> 20:46.396
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, I just got a call from a frat.

20:46.430 --> 20:48.632
Their D.J. for their year-end
toga barbecue just bailed.

20:48.666 --> 20:50.400
They saw my number in the student center...

20:50.434 --> 20:52.536
Boom! 200 bucks for the afternoon.

20:52.570 --> 20:54.538
That's great, man. Which frat?

Uh, Omega Pi? Ti?

20:58.576 --> 21:00.577
Yes.

21:00.611 --> 21:03.413
Oh, dude, was that your...?

21:03.447 --> 21:04.447
Yeah.

21:04.482 --> 21:07.217
Oh. Well...

21:07.251 --> 21:09.419
Those guys are total asshats.

21:09.453 --> 21:12.989
Trust me, if you do their party,
you're gonna end up arrested,

21:13.024 --> 21:14.357
or with alcohol poisoning, or both.

21:14.392 --> 21:16.326
They seemed pretty nice on the phone.

21:16.360 --> 21:18.195
Toby, they're jerks.

21:18.229 --> 21:20.163
It's really good money
and I need the exposure.

21:20.198 --> 21:23.200
- Come on, you gotta get this.
- No, I don't.

21:23.234 --> 21:25.035
I wouldn't expect you to drop a job

21:25.069 --> 21:27.070
just because I didn't like the guy.

21:27.104 --> 21:29.105
Dude, it's a job.

21:30.875 --> 21:33.143
Fine. Do what you want.

21:33.177 --> 21:35.812
It's not like we're friends.
We're just roommates.

21:35.846 --> 21:37.747
I can't expect you to have my back.

21:38.916 --> 21:40.717
There's that.

21:44.622 --> 21:46.756

21:46.791 --> 21:48.758
<i>that showed any identifying features.</i>

21:48.793 --> 21:50.594
It's from the entrance,
where they broke in,

21:50.628 --> 21:52.596
but there's nothing from the site.

21:52.630 --> 21:56.766
So much for technology.

21:56.801 --> 21:58.568
What, do you know him?

21:58.603 --> 22:00.370
Um, I'm not sure.

22:00.404 --> 22:01.671
Well, have you seen him before?

22:01.706 --> 22:04.341
Maybe,

22:04.375 --> 22:06.209
around the old neighborhood,

22:06.244 --> 22:08.144
if it's who I'm thinking of.

22:08.179 --> 22:10.480
Well, what's his name? I'll tell
the cops when I show them this.

22:10.514 --> 22:12.515
I'm not even sure it's the same kid.

22:12.550 --> 22:16.086
Well, let the cops rattle a few
cages and see what shakes out.

22:16.120 --> 22:19.189
I'm not gonna give the police an
excuse to rough up innocent people.

22:19.223 --> 22:21.258
I thought you wanted to catch this punk.

22:21.292 --> 22:23.226
The right punk.

22:23.261 --> 22:25.195
Look, let me ask around,

22:25.229 --> 22:29.065
see what I can find out before
you sic the police on him.

Hey, guys.

23:17.845 --> 23:21.481
Wow, that's fun.

23:21.515 --> 23:24.317
Interesting fashion statement.

23:24.351 --> 23:26.586
Natalie and her girlfriend were told

23:26.620 --> 23:28.688
that they couldn't wear tuxes,

23:28.722 --> 23:31.691
so we're doing this in solidarity.

23:35.629 --> 23:38.231
Angelo would have been proud.

23:40.434 --> 23:42.402
Have a great night.

23:44.171 --> 23:46.406
You look beautiful.

23:46.440 --> 23:48.207
I have to go talk to Daphne.

23:48.242 --> 23:50.243
- You need me?
- No, I got this.

23:56.044 --> 23:57.371
_

23:58.118 --> 24:01.054

repressive gender policies?

25:13.814 --> 25:16.616
Did you know Nacho was responsible

Unbelievable. How could
you know and not tell me?

25:41.175 --> 25:42.609
Unless

25:42.643 --> 25:45.211
you were with him.

25:45.246 --> 25:47.146
He was talking to someone in the video,

25:47.181 --> 25:49.349
but I couldn't make out who.

25:49.383 --> 25:52.051
Please tell me it wasn't you.

25:54.088 --> 25:55.255
Oh my God.

25:55.289 --> 25:58.224
Do you have any idea what you've done,

25:58.259 --> 26:00.960
how serious this is?

26:02.997 --> 26:05.965
You are still on probation.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.101
Are you trying to land in jail?

26:08.135 --> 26:10.103
Everything that we have worked so hard for,

26:10.137 --> 26:12.105
all the opportunities
that you've been given,

26:12.139 --> 26:13.840
and you risk it all for what?

26:15.910 --> 26:17.777
Talk to me, damn it.

26:17.811 --> 26:19.078
Do you really have nothing to say?

26:24.952 --> 26:26.686
I have to go to the clinic.

26:36.262 --> 26:38.296
Back already?

26:40.132 --> 26:42.133
The party ended a little early.

26:44.036 --> 26:46.938
<i>- (TV clicks off)
- Omega Psi parties never end early.</i>

26:46.972 --> 26:49.207
What happened? You get fired
halfway through the gig?

26:49.241 --> 26:51.343
Some guy set off the
sprinkler system in the house

26:51.377 --> 26:53.845
by flaming a mai tai.

26:53.879 --> 26:55.947
The fire department showed
up and shut the party down.

26:55.981 --> 26:58.950
Well, told you they were asshats.

26:58.984 --> 27:00.919
Actually, before that happened,

27:00.953 --> 27:02.854
everything was going really well.

27:02.888 --> 27:04.989
<i>The beer was good. The girls were hot.</i>

27:05.024 --> 27:06.825
They even gave me extra money

27:06.859 --> 27:09.027
in case the sprinklers
damaged my equipment.

27:09.061 --> 27:12.630
They were actually good guys.

27:12.665 --> 27:14.766
I'm glad it worked out for you.

27:27.913 --> 27:31.349
I felt awful the whole time I was there.

27:31.384 --> 27:32.751
I thought you just said...

27:32.785 --> 27:34.686
I shouldn't have gone.

27:34.720 --> 27:37.322
I knew it bugged you that I went,

27:37.356 --> 27:39.657
and out of principle,

27:39.692 --> 27:42.494
I should have stood by you.

27:46.132 --> 27:48.099
Actually, uh...

27:48.134 --> 27:49.401
I was thinking you were in the right.

27:49.435 --> 27:52.070
<i>You know, I'm the one who has
the beef with them, not you.</i>

27:52.104 --> 27:55.273
It's like, I hate the Bears, right?

27:55.307 --> 27:57.909
I can't expect you to hate them
just because we're roommates.

27:57.943 --> 28:00.011
Hey, I have my own reasons
for hating the Bears.

28:00.045 --> 28:02.213
(Chuckles) Thanks, man.

28:05.151 --> 28:08.920
This is getting seriously
close to a bro-hug situation.

28:08.954 --> 28:10.789
Tell you what:

28:10.823 --> 28:13.124
That extra $100 they gave me
is burning a hole in my toga.

28:13.159 --> 28:16.661
What do you say we go down to
Scratch, courtesy of Omega Psi?

28:17.696 --> 28:18.997
I think it's dollar slider night.

28:19.031 --> 28:21.800
100 sliders coming right up.

28:21.834 --> 28:23.735
Pace yourself there, D.J. T.K.

28:23.769 --> 28:26.571
And maybe lose the toga?

28:26.605 --> 28:28.706
Oh, for sure.

28:28.741 --> 28:30.675
Your daughter? Are you kidding me?

28:30.709 --> 28:31.843
Believe me, I wish I was.

28:31.877 --> 28:33.711
Didn't she know that this was your project?

28:33.746 --> 28:35.580
Yes. That's why she did it.

28:35.614 --> 28:37.382
Oh, that's just great...

28:37.416 --> 28:40.618
your mother-daughter warfare
playing out on my turf.

28:40.653 --> 28:42.654
I am sure it wasn't her idea.

28:42.688 --> 28:44.656
That kid must have talked her into it.

28:44.690 --> 28:46.458
But she went along willingly.

28:46.492 --> 28:48.426
I thought about not telling
you, but I did, because...

28:48.461 --> 28:52.197
because you don't want me to
press charges. I'm not an idiot.

28:52.231 --> 28:54.532
She's already on probation
for the Coto incident,

28:54.567 --> 28:57.268
and if she gets another strike,
who knows what could happen?

28:57.303 --> 29:00.338
- It could ruin college, her future... everything.
- It's not my fault.

29:00.372 --> 29:02.307
This is the bed that she made.

29:02.341 --> 29:04.409
Her dad just died.

29:04.443 --> 29:06.377
Does that give her the
right to break the law?

29:06.412 --> 29:09.981
She cost me hundreds
of thousands of dollars.

29:10.015 --> 29:11.850
She forced us into bed with Coto.

29:11.884 --> 29:13.284
This is your project too!

29:13.319 --> 29:15.086
I know!

29:15.120 --> 29:17.055
Wes, please,

29:17.089 --> 29:19.123
if our partnership means anything to you,

29:19.158 --> 29:21.125
do not turn her in.

29:23.062 --> 29:25.697
You need to go home now.

29:27.733 --> 29:28.733
Wes?

29:28.767 --> 29:30.735
I can't talk about this anymore.

29:30.769 --> 29:31.970
Just go home.

Hey, Mr. Z.

30:02.501 --> 30:04.402
Can't let you in.

30:04.436 --> 30:06.371
- Why not?
- You know why not.

30:06.405 --> 30:08.339
You're in violation of the dress code.

30:08.407 --> 30:11.175
The dress code is crap. Just let us in.

30:11.210 --> 30:14.145
Go home, put on dresses,
and I'd be happy to.

30:14.179 --> 30:15.480
You know, this is the kind of thing

30:15.514 --> 30:18.149
people love to sue over... discrimination.

30:18.183 --> 30:21.319
This isn't about being gay or straight.

30:21.353 --> 30:24.122
Last year some boys from another school

30:24.156 --> 30:26.457
<i>put on dresses and wigs and got drunk.</i>

30:26.492 --> 30:28.326
<i>They ruined the entire night.</i>

30:28.360 --> 30:30.295
This dress code is meant

30:30.329 --> 30:32.230
to prevent that sort of behavior.

30:32.264 --> 30:34.999
The problem wasn't that they wore dresses.

30:35.034 --> 30:37.001
It's that they were idiots.

30:37.036 --> 30:39.237
- It made a joke of the event.
- Well, we're dressed up.

30:39.271 --> 30:41.773
We're showing respect for the event.

30:46.011 --> 30:48.046
You don't think we look respectable?

30:48.080 --> 30:51.149
People are waiting to get
in, so if you could just...?

30:52.851 --> 30:55.653
Why does a girl in a suit
threaten you so much, Mr. Z?

30:55.688 --> 30:56.921
It doesn't threaten me.

30:58.023 --> 31:00.058
What, is it a sin? Is it unnatural?

31:00.092 --> 31:02.760
Stop provoking me.

31:02.795 --> 31:04.796
It's prom. You're girls.

31:04.830 --> 31:06.731
You need to be in dresses.

31:06.765 --> 31:09.734
<i>And I don't even know
where to begin with you.</i>

31:09.768 --> 31:12.904
And you two, you are prom king and queen.

31:12.938 --> 31:15.506
Consider your position at this school.

31:15.541 --> 31:17.575
Excuse me? Our position?

31:17.610 --> 31:19.844
How is what we're wearing
going to ruin anyone's night?

31:19.878 --> 31:23.448
You know what? I'd love to wear
sweats to class, but I can't,

31:23.482 --> 31:24.649
because it's not appropriate.

31:24.683 --> 31:26.751
<i>There are rules everywhere you go.</i>

31:28.654 --> 31:31.289
Okay, well, this isn't slavery.

31:31.323 --> 31:34.192
Oh, now I'm a slave owner?
Is that what she called me?

31:34.226 --> 31:35.593
We're calling you a fascist.

31:35.628 --> 31:39.530
Right, because you don't like the
rules, that makes me a fascist.

31:39.565 --> 31:41.399
What about all the kids in there

31:41.433 --> 31:44.302
who don't want to see
girls dressing like freaks?

31:45.337 --> 31:47.205
Did you call us freaks?

31:49.208 --> 31:51.376
Okay okay, that's enough.

32:03.547 --> 32:07.916
_

32:08.260 --> 32:09.994
Not if they can't go in.

32:09.995 --> 32:13.850
_

32:14.933 --> 32:16.968
Because I've been them,

32:17.002 --> 32:19.037
at Buckner, in my family.

32:19.071 --> 32:21.105
My whole life I felt

32:21.140 --> 32:22.974
like I was on the outside.

32:23.008 --> 32:25.710
And these rules make it okay

32:25.744 --> 32:28.680
to make certain people
feel like they're weird

32:28.714 --> 32:31.716
just for being who they are.

32:31.750 --> 32:33.918
And somebody has got to stand up for them.

32:34.769 --> 32:37.030
_

32:38.624 --> 32:40.491
What is it?

32:45.862 --> 32:50.969
_

32:54.070 --> 32:59.830
_

33:01.680 --> 33:04.482
That is really sweet.

33:04.516 --> 33:07.618
But if they can't go in,

33:07.653 --> 33:10.321
I don't want to be queen of this prom.

33:12.822 --> 33:15.556
_

33:18.397 --> 33:20.331
Hey.

33:20.365 --> 33:22.166
So what's the plan?

33:23.530 --> 33:25.610
_

33:34.279 --> 33:36.147
<i>Daphne's phone.</i>

33:42.548 --> 33:44.501
_

33:46.892 --> 33:49.894
Hi. This is Regina Vasquez... Daphne's mom.

33:49.928 --> 33:51.963
Can you tell me what
time her shift is over?

33:53.766 --> 33:56.701
What? When?

33:59.638 --> 34:01.973
She told me she went to the
clinic, but I just called there.

34:02.007 --> 34:04.809
- She was fired this afternoon.
- Fired?

34:04.843 --> 34:06.978
Okay, let's not panic. Any
idea where she might have gone?

34:07.012 --> 34:09.781
She took her car, but
left her cell phone behind.

34:11.483 --> 34:13.583
We had another big fight.

34:13.619 --> 34:15.887
And I was pretty hard on
her and said some things.

34:15.920 --> 34:19.690
And now she's out there, driving
around upset, just like Angelo was.

34:19.725 --> 34:21.525
Don't worry. We're gonna find her.

34:33.879 --> 34:35.880
No sweetie, it's fine.
Just call if she does, okay?

34:35.914 --> 34:38.581
All right, bye. Bay says
she's not at the prom.

34:38.617 --> 34:41.518
- That rules out Carlton.
- I'll try K&D.

34:41.553 --> 34:43.754
Kathryn, can you swing by the clinic?
Maybe she ended up there after all.

34:43.789 --> 34:45.556
Yeah. Where are you going?

34:45.590 --> 34:48.326
I'm gonna check out East Riverside,
try to find that kid Nacho.

34:48.360 --> 34:50.293
There's also Angelo's condo.

34:50.329 --> 34:53.431
Look, I'll go there. It's on the way.

34:53.465 --> 34:54.699
Are you sure we shouldn't call the police?

34:54.733 --> 34:56.400
It's only been a couple of hours.

34:56.435 --> 34:58.336
I think we see how we
do first, go from there.

34:58.370 --> 35:00.438
- Everyone stay in touch, okay?
- Okay.

Regina, any luck?

38:11.878 --> 38:13.245
<i>No. You?</i>

38:13.279 --> 38:16.982
She's not at the clinic. I'm
on my way to Angelo's right now.

38:17.016 --> 38:19.785
Wait.

38:19.819 --> 38:21.753
I think I found her.

38:32.932 --> 38:35.767
<i>(Distant train horn blowing)</i>

38:35.802 --> 38:37.836
I'm sorry.

38:37.870 --> 38:40.572
I'm so sorry.

38:40.606 --> 38:44.743
Honey, no.

38:44.777 --> 38:47.546
You're fine.

38:47.580 --> 38:49.548
It's okay.

38:49.582 --> 38:51.717
No, it's not.

38:51.751 --> 38:54.786
I messed up my job. And Dr. J. hates me.

38:54.821 --> 38:56.855
And Bay and Travis hate me,

38:56.889 --> 39:00.659
and they should, because
I'm a horrible person.

39:00.693 --> 39:03.695
And my mom...

39:03.730 --> 39:06.531
I have been terrible to her.

39:07.734 --> 39:09.801
Nobody hates you.

39:09.836 --> 39:12.637
You're not a horrible person.

39:12.672 --> 39:14.706
You're okay.

39:14.741 --> 39:16.908
It's going to be okay.

39:16.943 --> 39:18.710
No, it's not.

39:20.646 --> 39:23.682
All the years that I wasted

39:23.716 --> 39:26.618
with Angelo... being mad at him.

39:26.652 --> 39:30.455
He was trying so hard to make
a connection with me, and...

39:33.626 --> 39:35.694
Now it's too late.

39:37.830 --> 39:40.665
I felt the same way

39:40.700 --> 39:43.635
when I found out about the switch...

39:43.669 --> 39:47.539
all those years lost,

39:47.573 --> 39:50.809
all the milestones missed.

39:50.843 --> 39:54.579
But there's no going back,

39:54.614 --> 39:57.783
only forward.

39:57.817 --> 40:01.553
It's easy to live in anger,

40:01.587 --> 40:04.790
but I have to be grateful

40:04.824 --> 40:07.793
that at least eventually

40:07.827 --> 40:10.529
we found each other.

40:11.697 --> 40:13.665
I loved him,

40:13.699 --> 40:15.801
and I never said it.

40:15.835 --> 40:17.869
Honey...

40:19.605 --> 40:22.574
Angelo... Angelo knew.

40:22.608 --> 40:25.510
