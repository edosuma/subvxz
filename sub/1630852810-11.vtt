WEBVTT

01:06.816 --> 01:08.359
The bride has arrived.

01:10.320 --> 01:11.654
No way.

01:11.738 --> 01:13.573
Let the wedding begin!

01:14.616 --> 01:16.993
- What?
- What a beautiful dress!

01:17.077 --> 01:19.996
- So chic.
- You don't usually see white in Hell.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.331
And I love her clutch.

01:21.414 --> 01:22.916
That's my friend's face.

01:24.918 --> 01:26.169
Come on, come on!

01:26.252 --> 01:28.630
- Restrain her, Gomer.
- Gomer is here?

01:32.550 --> 01:35.345
Shut up, everyone!
Shut up! Stop the organ!

01:35.428 --> 01:38.473
My daughter is tired
from her long elevator trip.

01:38.556 --> 01:41.351
We're just going to adjust
her makeup and be right back.

01:41.434 --> 01:43.103
- I am not wearing makeup.

01:43.186 --> 01:44.771
- Quit shoving!
- Quit writhing.

01:44.854 --> 01:46.272
- Quit poking!

01:46.356 --> 01:47.607
I'll pull your face off!

01:47.690 --> 01:49.442
She's always been feisty…

01:49.526 --> 01:51.653
- …ever since she was a little girl.

01:57.033 --> 01:58.159
Now, stay put.

01:58.243 --> 01:59.160
Screw you.

01:59.244 --> 02:01.830
Why are you always
running away from your weddings?

02:01.913 --> 02:04.124
Now, stop wiggling.
Let me cover up those spots.

02:04.207 --> 02:05.041
They're freckles.

02:05.125 --> 02:06.626
Leave my cheeks alone.

02:06.709 --> 02:10.046
Your stupid schemes
have nothing to do with me.

02:10.130 --> 02:12.173
Oh, they have everything to do with you.

02:12.257 --> 02:15.343
Every twist and turn
in your ridiculous life, that was all me.

02:15.426 --> 02:19.013
I've overseen every detail
right down to the place settings.

02:19.806 --> 02:21.057
Goodbye, Luci.

02:23.852 --> 02:27.480
I don't know what that useless
dead demon saw in you anyway, Bean.

02:28.231 --> 02:29.232
Bean?

02:33.528 --> 02:34.445
Whoa!

02:43.705 --> 02:45.373
Bridesmaids, stop her!

02:49.711 --> 02:51.129
Try take off your heels!

03:21.367 --> 03:22.535
Shut up.

03:41.429 --> 03:43.848
Luci, welcome to paradise.

03:43.932 --> 03:45.892
This is great news.

03:45.975 --> 03:49.103
You are the first demon ever
to earn a place in Heaven.

03:49.187 --> 03:52.357
- And the first kitty cat, too.
- There are no cats in Heaven.

03:52.440 --> 03:54.025
Uh… Meow.

03:54.108 --> 03:55.568
Nice try, Luci.

03:55.652 --> 04:00.448
You're here because you sacrificed
yourself to save your good friend Bean.

04:00.531 --> 04:02.909
Sure she ended up in Hell, but cheer up!

04:02.992 --> 04:06.788
I know you're gonna love this place,
even if it takes ten million years.

04:11.292 --> 04:12.669
Oh, Go--

04:12.752 --> 04:16.130
Ah, happy sobbing. Wonderful!

04:16.214 --> 04:18.174
That's what feeds the River of Joy.

04:21.260 --> 04:25.348
If it makes you feel any better, this is
exactly what happened to me at my wedding.

04:25.431 --> 04:26.474
Minus the handcuffs.

04:26.557 --> 04:28.851
Most moms don't chain up their daughters.

04:28.935 --> 04:32.522
I can't believe you're sassing me
on the happiest day of my life.

04:32.605 --> 04:34.357
Ah, here we go.

04:35.858 --> 04:38.236
So that's the game
we're going to play, eh?

04:39.112 --> 04:41.614
You will look beautiful.

04:48.246 --> 04:49.247
Ah…

04:49.330 --> 04:50.873
- Gomer!

04:50.957 --> 04:52.208
Get me more lipstick.

04:52.292 --> 04:53.918
And don't test it this time.

04:55.003 --> 04:57.547
Never mind. I'll do it myself.

04:57.630 --> 05:00.758
And some concealer.
You have a lot to conceal.

05:00.842 --> 05:02.260
Don't go anywhere, darling.

05:14.063 --> 05:15.565
Oh, Luci.

05:17.817 --> 05:20.486
I'm so sorry your head got chopped off.

05:20.570 --> 05:23.865
I always thought your
nonstop negativity was a coping mechanism.

05:23.948 --> 05:26.200
But now, I see
you were right from the beginning.

05:26.284 --> 05:29.871
I <i>am</i> cursed
from the deepest depths of the underworld.

05:29.954 --> 05:32.123
You didn't think I was listening, did you?

05:37.628 --> 05:38.755
Wha…

05:38.838 --> 05:40.923
My tear, it brought you back to life.

05:41.007 --> 05:43.593
It didn't bring me back to life,
it just annoyed me.

05:43.676 --> 05:46.095
Ah, it's so good to hear your voice, Luci.

05:46.179 --> 05:48.014
But listen, I really need your help.

05:48.097 --> 05:50.767
Bean, look, I don't know
how much longer I'm going to last.

05:50.850 --> 05:53.019
I can't feel my legs. Do I even have legs?

05:53.102 --> 05:55.271
What happened to my sexy body?

06:03.321 --> 06:04.280
Be honest.

06:04.364 --> 06:06.783
Does this headless cadaver
make my ass look big?

06:06.866 --> 06:09.869
Knock it off, Toby.
That demon is one of the saviors.

06:09.952 --> 06:11.621
Look at the wall, you nitwit.

06:14.123 --> 06:17.794
It would've gone
so well with my rat-fur miniskirt.

06:17.877 --> 06:20.338
We must revitalize the sacred torso.

06:20.421 --> 06:22.840
- Get the goo, Benji.
- Get your own goo.

06:27.345 --> 06:32.475
Give it the goo!

06:43.569 --> 06:45.905
Ooh!

06:51.202 --> 06:57.708
Goo, goo! Goo, goo, goo!

07:10.680 --> 07:13.641
Aw!

07:20.148 --> 07:21.607
Ooh, it's brunch time.

07:21.691 --> 07:24.610
I'm excited for you to try
my deviled egg sandwiches.

07:24.694 --> 07:27.530
I made them with love and mayonnaise.

07:27.613 --> 07:29.866
But we don't even need food up here.

07:29.949 --> 07:33.035
You're just rubbing in the faces
of the starving millions.

07:33.119 --> 07:36.164
The sooner they starve,
the sooner they'll be in Heaven.

07:36.247 --> 07:38.583
Ooh, that is harsh. High five.

07:45.131 --> 07:47.633
I got another question for you.

07:47.717 --> 07:49.635
Go ahead. I enjoy these stumpers.

07:49.719 --> 07:52.138
Okay then. Did you make you?

07:52.221 --> 07:54.223
No. I always was.

07:54.307 --> 07:56.100
Then you didn't make everything.

07:56.184 --> 07:57.852
Oh, Jerry.

07:57.935 --> 08:02.106
It's going to take an eternity
to make you understand eternity.

08:02.190 --> 08:03.900
Okay. What about this?

08:03.983 --> 08:05.735
Is God everywhere?

08:05.818 --> 08:07.528
Yes, I am everywhere.

08:07.612 --> 08:09.780
Then you're in the toilet looking up?

08:09.864 --> 08:12.617
What would you say
if I told you yes?

08:12.700 --> 08:13.826
Yes, I am.

08:13.910 --> 08:15.203
I seen you in there.

08:16.537 --> 08:19.165
I'd say God lurks in mysterious ways.

08:20.541 --> 08:23.878
Luci, just because
I love all my creations,

08:23.961 --> 08:26.214
doesn't mean I care what you think.

08:29.634 --> 08:34.430
Secret elf meeting is starting. I repeat,
the secret elf meeting is starting.

08:36.057 --> 08:39.936
By now, I'm sure you've all
heard the crazy rumors.

08:40.019 --> 08:42.271
I knew it. The squirrels are back.

08:42.355 --> 08:44.106
- Ooh!
- Quiet.

08:44.190 --> 08:47.777
The uneasy peace between the elves
and the squirrels remains unbroken.

08:47.860 --> 08:49.028
Tell 'em, Leavo.

08:49.111 --> 08:52.865
We're talking about what I left
Elfwood for all those years ago.

08:52.949 --> 08:55.743
I found it here, deep inside the castle.

08:56.327 --> 08:57.995
- The very thing.
- The very thing.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.873
That's it? That's your big reveal?

09:00.957 --> 09:03.709
- What a bunch of horse--
- Oh, let me finish.

09:03.793 --> 09:05.127
Get ready, Shocko.

09:05.211 --> 09:06.837
For now, it can be told.

09:06.921 --> 09:12.802
Dreamland itself is the legendary
lost homeland of the elves.

09:13.386 --> 09:15.304
Shocko?

09:16.722 --> 09:18.015
He's dead.

09:19.016 --> 09:21.185
Oh, good.
I've been sleeping with his wife.

09:21.269 --> 09:22.520
Ooh!

09:22.603 --> 09:24.021
Now, where were we?

09:24.105 --> 09:28.150
Oh, yes. There's still much to be learned
about our forgotten elven history.

09:28.234 --> 09:32.405
We must be smart like dwarves,
and sneaky like squirrels.

09:32.488 --> 09:36.325
We must not let the humans
find out what we know until it's time.

09:36.409 --> 09:40.162
As per usual, in these situations,
Blabbo, you'll have to be arrested.

09:40.246 --> 09:41.664
Guards! Lock him away.

09:41.747 --> 09:45.376
In the future,
just don't invite me to these things.

09:49.505 --> 09:51.048
Where's my boy Elfo?

09:51.132 --> 09:52.925
He was taken away by ogres.

09:53.009 --> 09:55.845
- What?
- Calm down, calm down.

09:55.928 --> 09:58.848
You calling me
a lying hair-trigger rageaholic?

09:58.931 --> 10:00.433
I didn't call you anything.

10:00.516 --> 10:04.145
Well, I'm the only lying hair-trigger
rageaholic standing here.

10:17.950 --> 10:20.828
- Are we there yet?
- No.

10:20.911 --> 10:21.746
Are we there yet?

10:21.829 --> 10:24.457
If you say,
"Are we there yet," one more time,

10:24.540 --> 10:26.500
I'll stop this cage right now and eat you.

10:26.584 --> 10:28.753
Are you annoyed yet? I didn't say "there."

10:28.836 --> 10:30.838
God damn it, I warned you!

10:32.548 --> 10:34.634
- Stop. I'll be good.

10:37.053 --> 10:39.138
I'm back here.

10:39.221 --> 10:40.806
I can't believe that worked.

10:41.974 --> 10:43.559
Oh, I guess I should probably run.

10:52.234 --> 10:54.195
Gnomes? Are you guys still--

10:54.278 --> 10:55.655
Busy. We're at war here.

10:55.738 --> 10:58.783
Listen, guys,
I don't want to cause trouble,

10:58.866 --> 11:01.118
but the ogres are coming.

11:03.871 --> 11:05.539
This is gonna be good.

11:06.082 --> 11:10.044
And that's why
I only answer every 25th prayer.

11:10.127 --> 11:13.839
Well, why do we have to pray anyways?
You already know what we need.

11:13.923 --> 11:17.426
If I just gave you everything
you wanted without even asking,

11:17.510 --> 11:19.178
that wouldn't be fair, now, would it?

11:19.261 --> 11:21.514
You let lots of unfair things happen.

11:21.597 --> 11:26.435
Right now down on Earth, an innocent fly
is being eaten by a hungry spider.

11:26.519 --> 11:29.355
People get athlete's foot,
and they ain't even athletes.

11:29.438 --> 11:30.439
Hmm…

11:30.523 --> 11:33.192
I guess
a god this greedy can't be all bad.

11:33.275 --> 11:36.904
And what about Bean?
Everybody's forgotten about her.

11:36.987 --> 11:39.448
She's in Hell, and that's no fair.

11:39.532 --> 11:42.952
Oh, Jerry,
I don't intervene in that stuff.

11:43.035 --> 11:46.163
Except bunnies.
I give them a little bit of an edge.

11:46.247 --> 11:47.873
I can't help it, they're so cute.

11:47.957 --> 11:52.044
But otherwise, the troubles of Earth
are for humans to sort out.

11:52.128 --> 11:53.587
Jerry's a human, I think.

11:53.671 --> 11:54.714
Hey.

11:54.797 --> 11:59.176
Yeah. If Jerry is a human,
you could send Jerry down to Earth.

11:59.260 --> 12:02.930
No. Every time I send someone
down to Earth to make things better,

12:03.013 --> 12:06.726
another religion starts up,
and a lot of people get slaughtered.

12:06.809 --> 12:08.811
I don't want to make things better.

12:08.894 --> 12:10.646
I just want to save Bean.

12:10.730 --> 12:11.772
Come on, God.

12:11.856 --> 12:14.275
He's right, Goddo. Take a chance.

12:16.777 --> 12:19.029
- Ta-da!

12:19.113 --> 12:20.364
And flip.

12:20.948 --> 12:22.116
What? He's flipping a coin?

12:22.199 --> 12:24.243
Oh, existence makes sense now.

12:25.953 --> 12:27.580
Mmm. Mmm-hmm.

12:28.414 --> 12:30.332
All right, Jerry, are you ready?

12:30.416 --> 12:33.210
Not yet. I just have one more question.

12:33.294 --> 12:34.545
Where did you--

12:38.132 --> 12:42.678
Now, Luci, I heard some
rustling noises in my treasure chest.

12:42.762 --> 12:45.264
Is there anything you'd like to confess?

12:46.474 --> 12:51.270
Luci? Luci? Luci?

12:53.147 --> 12:55.024
What's up, Jerry?

12:55.107 --> 12:57.860
Oh, Luci in the sky with diamonds.

12:57.943 --> 13:00.362
I'm a goddamn genius.

13:14.210 --> 13:16.462
- This is hopeless.

13:16.545 --> 13:18.714
In a few minutes,
I'm going to be Satan's wife.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.424
You got it the wrong way around, girl.

13:20.508 --> 13:22.676
Satan's going to be <i>your</i> husband.

13:22.760 --> 13:24.595
- What does that mean?
- Bean, listen to me.

13:24.678 --> 13:26.889
In every bar fight,
you throw the first punch.

13:26.972 --> 13:30.601
Get tossed in a plague pit, you crawl out,
burned at the stake and still alive.

13:30.684 --> 13:32.603
You even went to Hell and back.

13:32.686 --> 13:34.313
Let's face it. You're impossible.

13:34.396 --> 13:37.399
Trust me, I'm your personal demon,
and I'm terrified of <i>you.</i>

13:37.483 --> 13:38.984
Aw!

13:39.068 --> 13:42.738
Listen to me, Bean, if there's anyone
who can out-Satan Satan, it's you.

13:42.822 --> 13:44.990
I don't know. You really think so?

13:45.074 --> 13:47.409
I know so, you crazy bitch.

13:50.871 --> 13:52.540
Luci? Luci?

13:53.082 --> 13:54.875
Those are your dying words?

14:15.646 --> 14:18.774
Jerry's back, and Jerry's front.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.693
I don't have a body.

14:20.776 --> 14:22.820
Help! Get me into a bottle right now!

14:22.903 --> 14:25.573
- Oh, don't fade away, kitty cat.

14:25.656 --> 14:26.615
A bottle, Jerry.

14:28.242 --> 14:29.410
My lucky hammer.

14:29.493 --> 14:32.788
Last time I saw you,
you were stuck in the back of my head.

14:33.539 --> 14:34.915
Quick, empty the bottle.

14:37.418 --> 14:39.044
Oh, chunky.

14:39.795 --> 14:40.754
"Expired"?

14:40.838 --> 14:42.256
Oh, finish it.

14:47.511 --> 14:48.846
Where is everybody?

14:49.471 --> 14:53.267
Cloyd? Becky? Joey?

14:56.520 --> 14:57.605
They're all gone.

14:57.688 --> 15:00.190
Hey, we gotta get the hell down
to Hell. Can we go already?

15:08.532 --> 15:10.200
What's the holdup, Jer? Jump!

15:10.284 --> 15:11.201
Mmm…

15:18.000 --> 15:19.793
Jer. Jerry.

15:23.339 --> 15:26.508
This is really scary.
Do you mind if I soothe myself?

15:26.592 --> 15:27.885
No. Go ahead.

15:37.937 --> 15:38.938
- Ow!

15:47.196 --> 15:49.990
- Oh, hello.
- Wrong room, pal.

15:51.867 --> 15:52.910
Pardon me.

15:52.993 --> 15:54.870
Do you need help with those manacles?

15:54.954 --> 15:56.121
No, I'm good.

15:56.205 --> 16:00.417
Well, it would be unbecoming of me to
marry someone who's chained up like this.

16:00.501 --> 16:02.294
- What?

16:02.378 --> 16:04.713
Only the best for my boot-wearing bride.

16:05.798 --> 16:07.549
Oh, you're the guy.

16:07.633 --> 16:08.968
I'm the guy.

16:09.051 --> 16:11.178
Wow. Wow.

16:11.261 --> 16:12.846
I got to be honest with you.

16:12.930 --> 16:16.558
I was a little nervous
about this wedding, but now…

16:16.642 --> 16:19.561
- Hello, good-looking!
- What?

16:19.645 --> 16:22.773
You are so handsome. Look at you.

16:22.856 --> 16:24.108
Are you talking to me?

16:24.191 --> 16:25.901
I am. Look at those eyes.

16:25.984 --> 16:28.112
Yes, hypnotic, aren't they?

16:28.195 --> 16:31.824
I can actually will the pupils to swirl.

16:31.907 --> 16:32.992
Whoa!

16:33.826 --> 16:36.120
They're like little spinning beach balls.

16:36.203 --> 16:39.206
- Oh.
- Look at that widow's peak,

16:39.289 --> 16:43.085
those high cheekbones,
that fiery red complexion.

16:43.168 --> 16:46.505
I mean, you look like one of those
little guys on a hot sauce bottle.

16:46.588 --> 16:48.090
Do you always talk this much?

16:48.173 --> 16:49.925
You're hilarious.

16:50.718 --> 16:54.388
But seriously, getting a closer look
at your face, I do love it.

16:54.471 --> 16:56.974
I do. But the goatee…

16:57.057 --> 16:58.434
Ah…

17:04.690 --> 17:06.316
- My goatee?
- I mean, it's great.

17:06.400 --> 17:10.863
But it's kind of pointy, like, maybe we
could think about changing up the shape.

17:10.946 --> 17:12.114
It's sort of a trademark.

17:12.197 --> 17:14.825
Mmm, I do get that,
but I think we should lose it.

17:14.908 --> 17:19.496
- "We"?
- I really, really, <i>really</i> do.

17:19.580 --> 17:22.291
I mean, I'm being honest now,
if we're going to be together,

17:22.374 --> 17:25.419
you're gonna have to
accept this kind of honesty.

17:25.502 --> 17:28.922
And, yeah, we gotta lose the goatee, babe.

17:29.006 --> 17:30.883
Listen, how do you feel
about throw pillows?

17:30.966 --> 17:33.427
There really aren't
any throw pillows in Hell.

17:33.510 --> 17:35.179
- Not yet.
- Oh, boy.

17:35.262 --> 17:38.140
This is gonna be incredible
'cause most people,

17:38.223 --> 17:39.975
when they get married,
it ends when you die.

17:40.059 --> 17:42.186
But with us, we're in it for eternity.

17:42.269 --> 17:43.979
Just you and me.

17:44.062 --> 17:47.900
Forever and ever and ever.

17:47.983 --> 17:49.485
That's a long time.

17:49.568 --> 17:53.238
Oh, and mandatory
marriage counseling for you.

17:53.322 --> 17:56.075
You're really emotionally shut down.

17:56.158 --> 17:59.411
I don't know if anyone's ever said that
to you before, but here we are.

18:01.413 --> 18:06.543
You need to dig deep from within and
figure out what's really holding you back

18:06.627 --> 18:10.172
'cause I think you are
ambitious to a certain extent,

18:10.255 --> 18:12.883
but I think you're really all about work.

18:12.966 --> 18:17.179
And I think you need to really
figure out who you are.

18:17.846 --> 18:19.431
- Ah, yeah.
- Uh-huh.

18:19.515 --> 18:20.974
Oh, and one more thing.

18:21.058 --> 18:23.268
Eternal monogamy,
and that includes everything.

18:23.352 --> 18:30.192
So sex, thoughts, daydreams, fantasies,
uh, reenactments, uh, cosplay, doodles.

18:30.275 --> 18:35.614
If I catch you doodling
any sort of sexual behavior,

18:35.697 --> 18:37.699
oh, you don't even want to see me.

18:37.783 --> 18:41.954
I'm going to bury myself in all of our
throw pillows, and it is going to be bad.

18:42.037 --> 18:44.289
You think this is Hell? Just wait.

18:44.873 --> 18:45.791
Don't listen to her.

18:45.874 --> 18:47.376
She's trying reverse psychology.

18:47.459 --> 18:49.169
Oh, yes.

18:49.253 --> 18:52.214
The old out-Sataning Satan gambit.

18:52.297 --> 18:54.800
Of course, I was one step
ahead of her the whole time.

18:54.883 --> 18:56.802
No, you weren't, you liar.

18:56.885 --> 18:59.805
Nice try, daughter dear,
but it's time to close the deal.

19:20.701 --> 19:23.537
Yay! Oh…

19:26.331 --> 19:28.250
- Yow!

19:28.876 --> 19:30.002
Oh, no.

19:33.463 --> 19:35.382
This is something you don't see every day.

19:35.465 --> 19:36.466
Double genocide.

19:39.511 --> 19:40.345
Hey.

19:42.014 --> 19:45.392
What the… Hey. Doink, doink.

19:45.475 --> 19:47.311
Well, here we go. Oh!

19:52.691 --> 19:55.903
We gotta figure out a way to find Bean
without anyone knowing we're here.

19:55.986 --> 19:57.196
I've got an idea.

19:58.322 --> 19:59.615
- Jerry.
- Bean!

19:59.698 --> 20:02.201
- No. Jerry, turn around. Idiot.
- Bean!

20:02.284 --> 20:03.452
- Jerry.
- Didn't work.

20:03.535 --> 20:04.953
- Just get me. Come on.
- Luci.

20:05.037 --> 20:07.164
- Where you going?
- I'm helpless.

20:07.247 --> 20:09.291
- Whoa. Whoa. Whoa!

20:09.374 --> 20:11.210
What are you thinking, baldy?

20:11.293 --> 20:12.461
I wish I could slap you.

20:13.795 --> 20:16.215
This is hard to see through…

20:16.298 --> 20:17.883
I can't… It's so heavy.

20:17.966 --> 20:19.217
Oh…

20:20.969 --> 20:21.887
Whoa!

20:21.970 --> 20:24.181
Wow! Oh, this is disgusting.

20:24.264 --> 20:25.265
Ah, finally.

20:25.349 --> 20:27.100
Whoa!

20:27.184 --> 20:28.393
Oh…

20:28.477 --> 20:29.978
Oh, it's so slimy in here.

20:30.062 --> 20:32.064
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.

20:32.147 --> 20:33.815
- Ow!

20:33.899 --> 20:35.734
Whee!

20:35.817 --> 20:37.694
I'm free!

20:37.778 --> 20:38.862
Ow!

20:39.947 --> 20:41.365
Where's your body, Duncan?

20:41.448 --> 20:43.951
Duncan can't
talk right now.

20:47.788 --> 20:48.872
Ah!

20:56.964 --> 20:58.590
Who are all these people?

20:58.674 --> 21:01.051
- Your friends, Bean.
- I have friends here?

21:01.134 --> 21:03.470
Well, all the people you've killed.

21:03.553 --> 21:05.681
Hansel and Gretel,
that was self-defense.

21:05.764 --> 21:07.641
Guysbert, that was an accident.

21:07.724 --> 21:08.642
Skybert…

21:08.725 --> 21:10.686
Oh, I would definitely kill him again.

21:20.028 --> 21:22.864
The debt to Hell is about to be repaid.

21:24.866 --> 21:27.869
Welcome to
the deepest depths of the underworld.

21:27.953 --> 21:30.872
It's good to see you all again so soon.

21:30.956 --> 21:34.793
On this most auspicious day
of unholy matrimony,

21:34.876 --> 21:36.795
we are gathered here to celebrate

21:36.878 --> 21:40.048
the 50,000th wedding
of our Lord and Master,

21:40.132 --> 21:46.138
the Prince of Evil, the Sultan of Sulfur,
the Bastard from Beaverton,

21:46.221 --> 21:49.224
the man with a golden pitchfork.

21:49.308 --> 21:50.392
That's right.

21:50.475 --> 21:54.521
I'm talking about Satan!

21:59.568 --> 22:01.611
- Excuse us.
- When is the buffet?

22:01.695 --> 22:02.988
Shut up, you two.

22:03.071 --> 22:06.033
I think this
legally binding contract puts it best.

22:06.116 --> 22:09.828
"The infernal debt shall be repaid
by marriage of the Queen of Dreamland

22:09.911 --> 22:11.163
to the King of Hell."

22:11.246 --> 22:14.583
"Consummation encouraged,
but not required."

22:14.666 --> 22:17.627
Oh, my God. You manipulated everything.

22:17.711 --> 22:20.672
All so I would become queen of Dreamland?

22:20.756 --> 22:23.216
It seems only fitting
that you fill my shoes,

22:23.300 --> 22:26.178
or in your case, overfill them.

22:26.261 --> 22:28.221
And now, the gross part.

22:28.305 --> 22:29.514
Hold out your palms.

22:33.935 --> 22:38.857
And now, Satan, behold this impressive
ceremonial dagger. You know the drill.

22:48.033 --> 22:50.285
The blood stamp of the King of Hell.

22:50.369 --> 22:51.203
Me.

22:52.954 --> 22:55.665
- And now my turn?
- Not so fast. Give me that.

22:55.749 --> 22:56.958
She can't be trusted.

23:00.587 --> 23:02.005
Don't do it, Mom.

23:04.132 --> 23:05.467
- Ha!
- Ow!

23:05.550 --> 23:06.802
No!

23:07.386 --> 23:09.513
The blood stamp of the Queen of Dreamland!

23:09.596 --> 23:11.973
- Ha! Ho!

23:25.862 --> 23:26.947
What? No hug?

23:30.158 --> 23:32.244
- Seize--
- Silence! I'll handle this.

23:32.327 --> 23:33.537
Seize her!

23:47.717 --> 23:49.094
Thanks, Gomer.

23:49.678 --> 23:50.595
Are you okay?

23:51.179 --> 23:52.472
I'm great.

24:07.946 --> 24:11.575
Jerry, Luci!
What are you doing here?

24:11.658 --> 24:14.077
We brought you a sandwich, but I ate it.

24:15.245 --> 24:17.247
Bean, what did you do to make them so mad?

24:17.330 --> 24:19.374
They're throwing giant can openers at us.

24:26.173 --> 24:28.383
Bean, have you seen my body?

24:28.466 --> 24:30.594
No, but I've got your severed head
jammed in my dress.

24:30.677 --> 24:31.511
Noice!

24:43.023 --> 24:44.316
Guys, head for that Hell hole!

25:04.211 --> 25:07.297
All right. Okay, this will
take us back to Dreamland.

25:07.380 --> 25:08.256
Oh…

25:10.550 --> 25:12.636
Come on, come on, come on!

25:12.719 --> 25:17.057
Well, well, well,
if it isn't Juanita Demonheimer.

25:17.140 --> 25:18.433
We meet again.

25:25.524 --> 25:28.360
Damn you, Juanita!

25:34.574 --> 25:36.910
Thank God we're home. I need a drink.

25:36.993 --> 25:39.204
- I need a body.
- I need a haircut.

25:41.373 --> 25:44.668
Ooh, swanky. I like Dweamland. Oh!

25:44.751 --> 25:48.129
It's pronounced Dreamland,
and this isn't it.

25:51.174 --> 25:52.926
<i>Curse you, Squalid Squirrel.</i>

25:53.009 --> 25:55.428
<i>You're really</i>
<i>in for it now, Bucktooth Beaver.</i>
