UGH! YOU INVITED
COUSIN MONTY?

00:28.561 --> 00:30.230
HOW COULD YOU?

00:30.296 --> 00:31.231
HE'S FAMILY.

00:31.297 --> 00:32.565
HE SHOULDN'T BE ALONE

00:32.632 --> 00:33.666
FOR THE HOLIDAYS.

00:33.733 --> 00:35.034
BUT HE'S SO ANNOYING.

THIS IS FOR YOU.

03:29.809 --> 03:31.244

03:44.357 --> 03:45.959
HELP ME PUT IT ON?

03:46.025 --> 03:47.794

04:46.853 --> 04:47.654
A CHRISTMAS KISS.

04:47.720 --> 04:49.355
I BET SHE'D LIKE THAT.

04:49.422 --> 04:50.523
WOULDN'T YOU?

04:50.590 --> 04:51.724
OKAY.

04:59.132 --> 05:01.334
IS THAT WHAT I THINK IT IS?

05:02.802 --> 05:04.037
WHAT WAS THAT?

05:04.103 --> 05:05.772
SALEM? I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

05:07.473 --> 05:08.875

THAT YOURS?

05:13.012 --> 05:14.781
HE MUST HAVE CRAWLED
INTO MY BAG.

05:14.847 --> 05:16.549
IT BELONGS TO YOU?

05:16.616 --> 05:18.718
WE DON'T ALLOW
ANIMALS IN HERE.

05:18.785 --> 05:19.719
YOU LET A MOUSE IN.

05:19.786 --> 05:21.454
UH, THERE'S
NO MOUSE.

05:21.521 --> 05:22.588
I SAW NO MOUSE!

05:22.655 --> 05:24.691
NOW, GET THAT DIRTY
CAT OUT OF HERE.

05:24.757 --> 05:26.793
NO, NOT THROUGH
THE FRONT DOOR.

05:26.859 --> 05:28.561
CATS ARE A HEALTH HAZARD.

05:28.628 --> 05:30.463

THE KITCHEN.

05:40.006 --> 05:41.774
I HAVE NEVER BEEN
SO MAD AT YOU

05:41.841 --> 05:42.942
IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.

05:43.009 --> 05:45.645
THERE WAS A MOUSE.

05:45.712 --> 05:47.346
I CHASED IT. END OF STORY.

05:47.413 --> 05:49.749
YOU GOT ME KICKED OUT
OF THE SLICERY.

05:49.816 --> 05:51.350
IT'S ONE PLACE I HAD PRIVACY.

05:51.417 --> 05:52.819
DON'T TALK TO ME
ABOUT PRIVACY.

05:52.885 --> 05:54.821
I'M THE ONE WHO HAS
TO RELIEVE HIMSELF

05:54.887 --> 05:56.723
IN A BOX IN THE KITCHEN.

05:56.789 --> 06:00.660
DO KNOW HOW HARD IT IS
TO GET THAT FARAWAY STARE GOING?

06:06.899 --> 06:08.501
I MEAN IT.

06:08.568 --> 06:10.136
I GOT THE PIZZA TO GO.

06:10.203 --> 06:11.537
ARE YOU OKAY?

06:11.604 --> 06:14.073
NO. I'M GETTING ATTITUDE
FROM MY CAT.

06:14.140 --> 06:16.909
SOMETIMES I WISH I COULD
JUST (<i> groaning</i> ) HIM!

06:17.510 --> 06:18.778
CUT HIM SOME SLACK.

06:18.845 --> 06:21.881
AFTER ALL, HIS BRAIN'S
ONLY THE SIZE OF A WALNUT.

06:32.525 --> 06:33.893
GOOD. I'LL WALK YOU HOME.

06:42.101 --> 06:43.703
I DON'T NEED YOU
TO GET HOME.

06:43.770 --> 06:46.005
FINE. STAY IN THE TRASH
FOR ALL I CARE.

06:46.072 --> 06:47.473
LET'S GO.

06:47.540 --> 06:49.842
THAT'S CUTE--
TALKING TO YOUR CAT.

06:49.909 --> 06:52.712
IF ONLY I COULD
GET HIM TO LISTEN...

06:52.779 --> 06:53.713
NO, NO...

I FORGOT MY FRUITCAKE.

07:29.749 --> 07:31.984
YOU DIDN'T MENTION
BRINGING AN EXTRA MOUTH.

07:32.051 --> 07:34.153
HILDA, HOW MUCH CAN
ONE LITTLE NEWT EAT?

07:34.220 --> 07:37.023
BESIDES, ANY FRIEND OF
MONTY'S IS WELCOME HERE.

07:37.089 --> 07:39.859
WELL, I'M DELIGHTED TO HEAR
YOU SAY THAT, ZELLY

07:50.703 --> 07:51.871
DO YOU MIND

07:51.938 --> 07:52.872
IF I STRETCH?

07:52.939 --> 07:54.040
ISN'T SHE A PIP?

07:54.106 --> 07:55.875
OH, SHE'S "PIPPY," ALL RIGHT.

07:55.942 --> 07:58.244
OF COURSE, SHE DOESN'T HAVE
A NICKEL TO HER NAME.

07:58.311 --> 08:01.480
I WISH I COULD HAVE MARRIED
MONEY, LIKE COLE PORTER

08:01.547 --> 08:03.816
BUT, LORD HELP ME,
I'M ATTRACTED TO THIS.

08:03.883 --> 08:05.952

17:57.476 --> 17:58.844
I NEED TO TALK TO YOUR CAT.

17:58.911 --> 18:00.312
WHY?

18:00.379 --> 18:01.580
YOU GOT THE WRONG CAT.

18:01.647 --> 18:03.816
HE BELONGS TO THIS
SWEET LITTLE BLONDE GIRL

18:03.882 --> 18:05.484
WHO MISSES HIM VERY MUCH.

18:05.551 --> 18:08.086
TOUGH LUCK.

18:08.153 --> 18:10.088
WELL, IF THAT'S HOW YOU FEEL
ABOUT IT

18:10.155 --> 18:13.192
THEN LET ME JUST GIVE, UH,

BUT, SANTA, YOU HAVE MY CAT.

18:25.204 --> 18:26.271
GOT TO GO.

18:26.338 --> 18:27.606
YOU CAN'T STEAL MY CAT.

18:27.673 --> 18:29.441
WATCH ME.

18:29.508 --> 18:31.310
SANTA'S STEALING MY CAT!

18:31.376 --> 18:33.212

18:33.278 --> 18:35.447

18:35.514 --> 18:37.883
SANTA STOLE MY CAT.

18:37.950 --> 18:41.553
OH, HONEY, NO, NO,
YOU MUST'VE BEEN DREAMING.

18:41.620 --> 18:43.222
YOU DON'T HAVE A CAT.

18:43.288 --> 18:45.224
NO, I SAW HIM. IT WAS REAL.

18:45.290 --> 18:47.192

19:29.501 --> 19:31.570
I GOT YOU SOMETHING,
BUT IT'S UPSTAIRS.

19:33.672 --> 19:35.641
SO WHERE'S MY PRESENT?

19:35.707 --> 19:38.410
IT'S MORE OF A PROMISE
THAN A PRESENT.

19:38.477 --> 19:39.411
NO PRESENT?

19:39.478 --> 19:40.879
WAIT.
YOU'LL LIKE IT.

FROM NOW ON?

19:45.851 --> 19:47.419
NO. LIKE A WEEK.

19:47.486 --> 19:49.521
THAT'S IT?

19:49.588 --> 19:51.590
OKAY, TEN DAYS, BUT

20:01.800 --> 20:02.901
MARRY ME.

20:02.968 --> 20:04.269
I DON'T CARE

20:04.336 --> 20:06.371
IF YOU'RE POOR
AND HAVE NO SPINE.

20:06.438 --> 20:07.239
MARRY ME.

20:07.306 --> 20:09.908
MONTY, I WOULD LOVE
TO BE YOUR WIFE.

20:09.975 --> 20:11.410
AND HERE.

20:11.476 --> 20:13.345
THIS IS FOR YOU.

20:13.412 --> 20:16.381
OH. OH, YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE.

20:16.448 --> 20:18.984
OH, DEAR, THIS IS A SOLID
GOLD CIGARETTE CASE.

20:19.051 --> 20:20.519
BUT YOU'RE A CIRCUS ACT.

20:20.586 --> 20:22.387
HOW COULD YOU AFFORD THIS?

20:22.454 --> 20:23.689
OH, I FORGOT TO TELL YOU.

OH.

20:26.658 --> 20:27.759
OH, DEAR GIRL.

20:27.826 --> 20:30.696
THIS<i> IS</i> THE BEST
CHRISTMAS EVER.

20:30.762 --> 20:33.532
I'D LIKE TO
PROPOSE A TOAST.

20:33.599 --> 20:34.700
TO FAMILY...

20:34.766 --> 20:36.535
AND TO FRIENDS.

20:38.537 --> 20:40.339
All:
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.749
SALEM'S REALLY
HAPPY TO BE HOME.

20:50.816 --> 20:51.984

IT IS GREAT
TO BE HOME!

21:06.865 --> 21:07.899
OHH, YES, YES, YES!

21:07.966 --> 21:10.602
I THINK HE LIKES
MY PAPER BEST.

21:10.669 --> 21:13.372
(<i> imitating motor</i> )

21:13.438 --> 21:16.041
HONEY, DON'T YOU
WANT TO RIDE

21:16.108 --> 21:18.644

21:32.491 --> 21:35.427
IT'S THE
BEST CHRISTMAS
PRESENT EVER.

21:35.494 --> 21:36.728
HE LOVES IT SO MUCH.

21:36.795 --> 21:37.863
WHERE'D HE GET IT?

21:37.929 --> 21:39.898
WELL, I GUESS
THE SAME PLACE

21:39.965 --> 21:41.767
