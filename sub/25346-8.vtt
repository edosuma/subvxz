[Bobby] Look at that truck
full of homosexuals.

00:12.846 --> 00:15.515
-[Jonathan] Yeah.
-[Bobby] We're making America great again.

00:15.598 --> 00:17.142
[Jonathan] We're patriotic queers.

00:17.225 --> 00:19.936
If I was president,
you couldn't decorate my truck like this.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.938
-It's too much.
-[Tan] I kind of love it.

00:22.021 --> 00:23.064
-[Karamo] Really?
-Yeah.

00:23.148 --> 00:26.025
I love how tacky it-- America is tacky.

00:26.109 --> 00:28.737
Let me tell you,
do not call America tacky.

00:28.820 --> 00:31.322
Have you seen the jewelry you have on?

00:40.749 --> 00:43.460
[Tan] I can't explain why
we've done this to the car,

00:43.543 --> 00:47.338
but what I can tell us all is that
we're gonna go see Ted Terry.

00:47.422 --> 00:48.923
-Ted Terry!
-Yeah.

00:49.007 --> 00:51.551
Ted's been a public servant
since he was 17.

00:51.634 --> 00:55.305
He's 34, and he's the youngest mayor
in Clarkston history.

00:55.388 --> 00:57.682
-That's cool.
-All right, Kennedy.

00:57.766 --> 01:01.895
-He's a bit young for politics.
-We need more young people in politics.

01:01.978 --> 01:02.937
-Yes.
-Yes.

01:03.021 --> 01:06.524
Ted was nominated by his girlfriend
of seven years, Andrea.

01:06.608 --> 01:08.276
Gonna handle this pile.

01:08.359 --> 01:12.947
My girlfriend, who we affectionately call
The Mayoress of Clarkston,

01:13.031 --> 01:14.741
she has nominated me

01:14.824 --> 01:19.287
because she wants me to up my game
a little bit, on being mayor.

01:19.370 --> 01:23.833
Ted's a hipster mayor, but it can
come across a little bit slouchy.

01:23.917 --> 01:26.961
Anyone who's seen him likes to comment
on his beard.

01:27.045 --> 01:28.922
He calls it his resistance beard.

01:29.005 --> 01:32.217
It's a flavor saver.
It picks up what you eat or drink.

01:32.300 --> 01:35.386
And I have done no grooming of it
whatsoever.

01:35.470 --> 01:38.264
People say it looks like
a dirty hippie beard,

01:38.348 --> 01:40.934
and that makes them
not take him seriously.

01:41.017 --> 01:44.145
It looks like that goat
from the Red Riding Hood.

01:44.229 --> 01:49.109
It's ballooned into this absurd,
mountain man, straggly mess.

01:49.192 --> 01:50.902
A younger Santa Claus.

01:50.985 --> 01:54.823
I'm gonna set aside these business cards.
Throw away all these.

01:54.906 --> 02:00.203
Around the house, I would love it
if he didn't leave stuff everywhere.

02:01.871 --> 02:03.873
Good to see you.
Just here to get my mail.

02:03.957 --> 02:08.128
Ted does not have a set office
for his mayoral work.

02:08.211 --> 02:11.798
He gave it up to people at City Hall,
they needed the space.

02:11.881 --> 02:15.468
That lack of an office creates
this, like, snowball effect.

02:15.552 --> 02:18.388
Without an office,
you can't get into a routine.

02:18.471 --> 02:21.015
I'm always on the go and on the fly.

02:21.099 --> 02:22.475
Good evening, everyone.

02:22.559 --> 02:26.229
Ted's public speaking skills,
they have a long way to go.

The political landscape in Georgia
is like the old guard.

02:33.528 --> 02:35.071
[Ted] The first impressions are,

02:35.155 --> 02:39.033
"Do you work for the mayor?
[laughs] You can't be the mayor, can you?"

02:39.117 --> 02:42.704
People assume that he's inexperienced,
because of his youth.

02:42.787 --> 02:45.540
[Ted] I worry about being
the 13-year-old mayor.

02:45.623 --> 02:49.252
I'm getting invited
to more international gatherings

02:49.335 --> 02:54.924
and conferences and speaking engagements,
and I think she wants me to really shine

02:55.008 --> 02:59.012
and put on the best light
for the city of Clarkston and for myself.

02:59.095 --> 03:01.848
If anyone can help Ted,
it'll be the Fab 5.

03:02.265 --> 03:05.602
Ted Terry this week is hosting,
at his home, a dinner

03:05.685 --> 03:08.938
for delegates from the Philippines
and Sierra Leone.

03:09.022 --> 03:11.941
He has not had people at his home
for ten years.

03:12.025 --> 03:14.986
-And his first guests are delegates?
-Delegates.

03:15.069 --> 03:18.865
He needs help with his speeches,
with his house, with the food.

03:18.948 --> 03:22.035
-He's got a beard that's terrifying.
-Let's find him.

03:22.118 --> 03:25.413
It is House of Cards.
It is major. It is bigtime.

03:27.624 --> 03:29.208
[bullhorn wailing]

03:29.292 --> 03:31.961
Please tell me where Mayor Ted Terry is.

03:32.045 --> 03:35.048
There are five queens looking
for the mayor.

03:35.131 --> 03:36.382
[both laughing]

03:36.799 --> 03:40.386
-Do you know where the mayor is?
-[Antoni] Mayor, long beard, hipster.

03:40.470 --> 03:43.139
-Hipster-looking. Whoo!
-[Karamo] No office.

03:44.057 --> 03:46.976
-Help us out. We're looking for the mayor.
-Crazy.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.437
-We need the mayor.
-We need Ted Terry.

03:49.520 --> 03:52.065
Anybody know where Mayor Ted Terry is?

03:53.524 --> 03:55.443
Do you know where the mayor is?

03:55.526 --> 03:58.821
-Yes, I do. I'm his friend on Facebook.
-You are.

03:58.905 --> 04:01.282
-Where do we turn?
-Right up there.

04:01.366 --> 04:04.452
[chanting] Ted! Ted! Ted!

04:04.535 --> 04:08.373
[Karamo] I see a beard
that is out of order and out of date.

04:11.668 --> 04:14.712
-[Antoni] There's that beard.
-Oh, my God.

04:14.796 --> 04:17.799
-Get us out of this truck.
-The Fab 5 is here.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.927
-What's going on?
-What's up?

04:21.010 --> 04:23.346
-Hello, man.
-There you go.

04:23.429 --> 04:26.182
I'm Jonathan, how are you?
Nice to meet you.

04:26.266 --> 04:27.308
Hi, nice to meet you.

04:27.392 --> 04:31.396
-Was this a business meeting right here?
-Uh, yeah, just casual.

04:31.479 --> 04:34.440
Beard, beard, beard.

04:34.524 --> 04:37.777
This is my resistance beard.
It's out of control.

04:37.860 --> 04:41.239
My first impression of Mayor Ted,
not really very mayor.

04:41.322 --> 04:43.658
Kind of more man-goat.

04:43.741 --> 04:47.161
Nice meeting everybody.
We're taking Mayor Ted with us.

04:47.245 --> 04:49.998
[Karamo] Say goodbye to the old Ted Terry.

05:12.520 --> 05:13.563
Andrea!

05:13.646 --> 05:16.024
A nice, undramatic entrance.

05:16.107 --> 05:19.777
-Hi.
-Hi, I'm Tan. Can I give you a hug?

05:19.861 --> 05:22.780
-[Karamo] Can we come in, please?
-Yeah, it's hot out here.

05:22.864 --> 05:24.157
-Let us in.
-Welcome.

05:24.240 --> 05:25.575
Hello!

05:25.658 --> 05:28.494
We're so appreciative of you,
but some of this has to go.

05:28.578 --> 05:30.371
You stick to your category.

05:30.913 --> 05:32.123
[laughing]

05:32.206 --> 05:35.126
You guys are healthy. We've got granola.

05:35.209 --> 05:38.963
This house is giving me
very farm hobo chic.

05:39.047 --> 05:40.256
Jonathan, look.

05:40.339 --> 05:43.384
This is what eggs are supposed to be like.
They're so irregular.

05:43.468 --> 05:45.970
-I love irregular eggs.
-Yeah, me, too.

05:46.054 --> 05:49.057
Is this what they put on their laps
to eat dinner?

05:49.140 --> 05:51.142
-[Jonathan] Maybe.
-What's going on in here?

05:51.893 --> 05:55.396
Okay, kind of organize it a little bit.
Okay.

05:55.480 --> 05:57.690
The bathroom, it is bleak in there.

05:57.774 --> 06:00.151
This has not been used in a while.

06:00.234 --> 06:03.946
It is like the Russian winter
in World War I, honey.

06:05.656 --> 06:07.575
-What is this outfit?
-[Tan] Put it on.

06:07.658 --> 06:09.285
Like, let's see you in it.

06:09.368 --> 06:11.454
Oh, my God, it looks so fantastic.

06:11.537 --> 06:12.872
-Does it?
-Yes.

06:12.955 --> 06:15.374
I haven't worn it yet, but I bid on it.

06:15.458 --> 06:18.044
-That was an auction item.
-At a gala.

06:18.127 --> 06:22.715
-So, this is your office area?
-Uh, yes, and the kitchen counter.

06:22.799 --> 06:24.258
[grunting]

06:24.967 --> 06:29.514
This looks more like frat guy
kind of just threw some things on a table.

06:29.597 --> 06:31.724
Doesn't look like mayor of a city.

06:31.808 --> 06:34.602
[Bobby] You're gonna have
a dinner party here?

06:34.685 --> 06:35.520
Yes.

06:35.603 --> 06:38.815
-Where's your dining room?
-Uh, we don't have a dining room.

06:38.898 --> 06:41.651
-All right.
-This doubles as a dining room,

06:41.734 --> 06:43.194
slash, my yoga room.

06:43.277 --> 06:47.782
I don't see any people who are officials
coming to this house, ever.

06:48.366 --> 06:50.701
Oh, my God. I wanna teach you all.

06:50.785 --> 06:54.413
So, everyone,
get into dogward, downward.

06:54.497 --> 06:56.374
-Dogward down.
-There you go.

06:56.457 --> 06:58.543
You guys, boundaries.

07:00.253 --> 07:03.422
Now I need you to get into
cat pose three.

07:04.799 --> 07:06.425
Namaste away from me.

07:06.509 --> 07:09.679
-There's a smell.
-That's a strong smell.

07:09.762 --> 07:13.724
I mean, this is the bedroom
of someone who's busy saving the world.

07:13.808 --> 07:16.519
-Oh, he's got Hillary signs.
-I love it.

07:16.602 --> 07:17.687
[all cheering]

07:20.940 --> 07:23.901
Stronger together, Ted, we are!
I love her!

07:23.985 --> 07:26.821
Hillary! Hillary! I love her! I love her!

07:26.904 --> 07:28.906
-I was a Bernie Sanders delegate.
-Oh.

07:29.615 --> 07:32.160
-This room is cluttered as hell.
-[Tan] I know.

07:32.243 --> 07:36.164
What is going on in here?
Is this the world-famous purple tie?

07:36.247 --> 07:38.583
-It is.
-And purple lavender shirt?

07:38.666 --> 07:41.043
That you have every meeting in?

07:41.127 --> 07:43.588
[Jonathan] He won an election
in that shirt.

07:43.671 --> 07:44.505
I don't care.

07:44.589 --> 07:47.508
-Not that shirt. Not that shirt.
-Not that shirt.

07:47.592 --> 07:51.429
Yeah. This purple shirt [shouts]
has to go.

07:52.346 --> 07:54.098
Hold on, we're not done yet.

07:54.807 --> 07:58.394
-Cute, yes.
-Oh, my God, I can see it.

07:58.478 --> 08:02.815
You're here and then he comes in,
and you're like, "Mr. Mayor..."

08:02.899 --> 08:04.567
Then you crawl to him.

08:04.650 --> 08:07.445
And she asks him to
verify her ballot box.

08:07.528 --> 08:10.323
Yes!

08:10.406 --> 08:12.116
Andrea voted for me.

08:13.493 --> 08:18.080
Hey, Jonathan, let's go see chickens.
Let's go find you some big black...

08:18.164 --> 08:19.248
[crowing]

08:19.332 --> 08:22.168
-They're so cute.
-[Karamo] I wanna hold a chicken.

08:22.251 --> 08:25.755
Here, kitty, kitty.
Come around here. They're all here.

08:25.838 --> 08:27.507
Come here, poopy.

08:27.590 --> 08:30.718
Let's talk about this dinner party
that you guys have.

08:30.801 --> 08:33.513
What's the purpose of it, first of all?

08:33.596 --> 08:38.559
One of the things that I'm hoping to do
over the next four years as mayor

08:38.643 --> 08:41.437
is to expand my international relations.

08:41.521 --> 08:45.983
Why is it important to host this
in your home and not in a restaurant?

08:46.067 --> 08:50.404
I like showcasing the restaurants,
we have great restaurants in Clarkston.

08:50.488 --> 08:54.992
But sometimes you want a little intimate,
just kind of relationship-building.

08:55.076 --> 08:59.747
When Ted's in charge of cooking,
things go really awry, to put it nicely.

08:59.830 --> 09:02.583
He has no concept
of how long things will take.

09:02.667 --> 09:06.837
You're nervous. Are you stressed out?
I don't mean to be like a teacher.

09:06.921 --> 09:08.422
The cooking, I'm trying to, uh...

09:08.506 --> 09:12.093
It doesn't have to be stressful.
I want this to be enjoyable.

09:12.176 --> 09:14.887
[Karamo] Here we go. [clucking]

09:14.971 --> 09:17.932
-Go for it, Jonathan.
-They don't love me.

09:18.015 --> 09:22.395
[Antoni] This is such
a freaking cool yard. Oh, my gosh.

09:22.478 --> 09:26.816
We've got, um, a bunch of different
varieties of tomatoes growing.

09:26.899 --> 09:29.610
-There's some tomatillos right here.
-[Antoni] Yum.

09:30.903 --> 09:32.446
[Karamo] Can we get that one?

09:34.115 --> 09:35.658
[Tan] Oh, don't scare them.

09:37.034 --> 09:39.203
Oh, I herded the crap out of them.

09:40.830 --> 09:45.376
You guys have an abundance of beautiful
vegetables and fruit that we can use.

09:45.459 --> 09:46.502
It's like, why not?

09:48.045 --> 09:51.299
What is it like for you being a mayor?
What's your biggest challenge?

09:51.382 --> 09:52.592
I get no respect.

09:52.675 --> 09:57.305
Um, the older council members,
older people in general,

09:57.388 --> 10:01.767
will usually assume, "Well, you're young,
so, you don't know anything."

10:01.851 --> 10:05.354
Even though I've been working
in this arena since I was 17.

10:05.438 --> 10:09.609
If I do the talking, people at the table
are like, "Why are you talking?"

10:09.692 --> 10:11.402
Are you a good public speaker?

10:11.485 --> 10:14.989
I could definitely be a lot better.
I'd love to learn.

10:15.072 --> 10:18.451
That. There we go.
That is what I'm feeling like.

10:18.534 --> 10:21.245
If you're part of the political culture,

10:21.329 --> 10:24.457
you need to know
that speeches can make or break you.

10:25.416 --> 10:29.545
I'm noticing organization,
you need some help there.

10:29.629 --> 10:33.090
Also kind of separating the work
and the home life.

10:33.382 --> 10:37.094
This has not been used in years.
Look at all the dust on this.

10:37.178 --> 10:40.473
And also a way to bring work
and personal life together.

10:40.556 --> 10:44.852
You're a politician. You need to be
entertaining delegates, constituents.

10:44.935 --> 10:49.190
I wanna make your home open to the public,
but also separate that life.

10:49.273 --> 10:52.693
My advice, always make sure
you put your "work life,"

10:52.777 --> 10:55.738
even if it's at home,
behind a door that can close.

10:55.821 --> 10:59.033
What I'm most excited about,
this space here.

10:59.116 --> 11:02.912
I think this has the potential
to give you your office space.

11:02.995 --> 11:06.457
Turn this into a space
that you can do all your business,

11:06.540 --> 11:09.335
-so when you come in here it's work time.
-Yeah.

11:10.670 --> 11:15.091
So, this is where we are,
where all the magic happens.

11:15.174 --> 11:18.177
Tell me about your beard.
You had a beard before?

11:18.260 --> 11:20.262
I grew it out after the election.

11:20.346 --> 11:25.309
Ted Terry's style is definitely,
"I get up early, meet with constituents.

11:25.393 --> 11:29.355
I'll put on some Dickies khakis
and I won't give an F,

11:29.438 --> 11:32.608
'cause I'm saving people."
But, honey, I give an F.

11:32.691 --> 11:37.696
For something important, like a big speech
or some big event coming up,

11:37.780 --> 11:41.367
would you give 20 minutes to your look?

11:41.450 --> 11:44.203
I don't know what to do
for more than five.

11:44.286 --> 11:45.704
I'm gonna show you.

11:45.788 --> 11:48.833
He's literally at the end
of his grooming rope.

11:49.417 --> 11:53.129
We're gonna get you into some mousse,
a bit of hairspray.

11:53.212 --> 11:55.714
-A wet product and a dry product.
-Okay.

11:55.798 --> 11:58.175
Your eyes are getting big and scared.

11:58.259 --> 12:01.053
It's all new,
but I'm here to take advice.

12:01.137 --> 12:04.849
I'm gonna walk you through it.
I'm gonna hold your mayoral hand.

12:04.932 --> 12:07.476
-I am. We're gonna get this.
-Thank you.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.770
Do you find it easy
dressing in the morning?

12:09.854 --> 12:11.063
Uh...

12:11.147 --> 12:15.443
Yeah, 'cause it's very quick and easy.
I don't spend much time doing it.

12:15.526 --> 12:18.904
So, what do you go for?
'Cause it's a mess.

12:19.947 --> 12:22.992
-I'll just do a shirt with a button down.
-Okay.

12:23.075 --> 12:26.078
And then just whatever pants are clean.

12:26.162 --> 12:29.832
On the whole, do you have
a lot of this stuff from college?

12:29.915 --> 12:32.251
This is all probably ten years old.

12:32.334 --> 12:35.671
-Ten years is a real...
-Yeah, definitely ten years old.

12:35.754 --> 12:38.591
He needs to step it up.
He's got grand ambitions.

12:38.674 --> 12:41.677
He's not gonna get there
if he sticks with that wardrobe.

12:41.760 --> 12:46.765
-I hear that this is your, um, best suit.
-Yeah, look, has my name in it.

12:47.183 --> 12:48.517
[both laughing]

12:48.601 --> 12:52.354
-I love that you mentioned that.
-I've been wearing this for five years.

12:52.438 --> 12:54.273
That one's got rips in the bum.

12:54.356 --> 12:57.359
-I don't think I've worn this in years.
-You should definitely not.

12:57.443 --> 12:59.778
-I'm holding on to clothes.
-No, you're a hoarder.

12:59.862 --> 13:02.698
-I'm not a hoarder. [laughs]
-You're kind of hoarder-ish.

13:02.781 --> 13:05.743
-You're not getting rid of old suits.
-Ish, ish.

13:05.826 --> 13:08.871
When you go to work,
are you wanting to wear a sneaker?

13:08.954 --> 13:12.917
-Do you wear a formal shoe?
-Um, I have those brown shoes right there.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.544
These are the only shoes you got. Brown...

13:15.628 --> 13:18.464
[Ted] Mm-hm.
I don't really like black shoes.

13:18.547 --> 13:20.257
You have two pairs of shoes.

13:20.341 --> 13:23.093
Yeah. There are other shoes in there,
but I don't wear them.

13:23.177 --> 13:26.138
The red shoes are my campaign shoes,
but they're falling apart.

13:26.222 --> 13:29.475
You go out on the street
and you meet people with these?

13:29.558 --> 13:31.519
I won my election in those shoes.

13:31.602 --> 13:33.729
-You keep them for sentimental value.
-Mm-hm.

13:33.812 --> 13:37.191
I will get them fixed.
I don't know how to get them fixed.

13:37.274 --> 13:39.401
-Why?
-For sentimental...

13:39.485 --> 13:43.447
There's no repairing them.
I promise you, there's no repairing them.

13:43.531 --> 13:47.243
I'm gonna get you a nice, formal shoe
that is gonna be classic,

13:47.326 --> 13:51.080
that is gonna stand the test of time.
These ones are very dated.

13:51.163 --> 13:55.751
I wanna do a great job for Ted.
He's helping, he's truly helping people.

13:55.834 --> 13:58.462

I'm, in return, helping him.

13:59.046 --> 14:01.715

Now that we went through all your stuff,
what are you hoping to get from us?

14:06.428 --> 14:08.764
Uh, yeah, I think I need to up my game.

14:08.847 --> 14:12.768
I need to be the best mayor I can be,
to represent Clarkston.

14:12.851 --> 14:15.521

14:15.604 --> 14:19.817
Mr. Ted Terry, I love what you stand for,
well, so far.

14:19.900 --> 14:23.988
I'm pretty sure that I'm obsessed,
but I just need to rein it in.

14:24.071 --> 14:26.365
I know that if we can figure out a way

14:26.448 --> 14:29.201
to bring all these religions
and ethnicities

14:29.285 --> 14:32.079

together in Clarkston,

14:32.162 --> 14:34.957

and peacefully,

14:35.040 --> 14:38.586

to around the world.

The lesson that I wanna teach Ted is that
he can host these events in his own home.

15:35.601 --> 15:38.562

He needs to look a certain way,

one of the quintessential
fine dining spots in Atlanta,

16:08.008 --> 16:13.681

wild and drunken stupor and revelry.

16:13.764 --> 16:14.723

[Antoni] Oh, sweet.

-Have you been here?
-[Andrea] Never.

16:18.686 --> 16:22.022

So, I wanted to show you what a standard
minimal setup sort of looks like.

16:37.246 --> 16:41.166
We don't wanna keep it complicated
with the six-fork situation.

16:41.250 --> 16:44.712
Your eyes are already getting big.
We're not doing that.

16:44.795 --> 16:48.465
It's very simple.
We have an appetizer fork, a dinner fork.

16:48.549 --> 16:51.844
We're gonna be having fish,
so, we have a fish knife,

16:51.927 --> 16:55.180

red wine glass, white wine glass.

-Do you know the difference?
-[Andrea] No, I don't.

16:57.850 --> 17:00.436
-It's basically about size.
-[Andrea] Okay.

17:00.519 --> 17:02.062
So, red is for the larger.

17:02.146 --> 17:05.149
More swirling to open up the wine
and get the notes.

17:05.232 --> 17:06.650
The white is more about crisp.

17:06.734 --> 17:10.446
We'll have a dinner plate,
an appetizer plate, cloth napkins.

Okay, fine, what is more Georgia
than blueberries?

18:10.297 --> 18:11.924
[Ted] Peaches. It's a peach state.

When I design a client's home,
including Mayor Ted,

18:49.670 --> 18:51.797
I think about
the way it needs to function.

18:51.880 --> 18:55.759
I see the bathroom stuff,
and your bathroom needs help.

18:55.843 --> 18:58.720
-Yes.
-It doesn't just need to be beautiful,

18:58.804 --> 19:01.056
It needs to work.

19:01.140 --> 19:04.143
I love doing a nice, light color towel.

19:04.226 --> 19:06.395
If you get them messy,
you can bleach them.

19:06.478 --> 19:11.608
These would be cool for your office area,
to put little things.

19:11.692 --> 19:13.402
Everything needs its place.

19:13.485 --> 19:18.073
The other thing I love doing is lanterns.
They add a nice ambient lighting.

19:18.157 --> 19:21.201
You can use real candles.
You can use digital ones.

19:21.285 --> 19:23.328
I love that Ted's a man
of the people.

19:23.412 --> 19:28.667

bus stops, restaurants. It's cool.

19:28.750 --> 19:31.837
I am all about
function, function, function.

19:31.920 --> 19:34.715
But there are meetings
that need private space.

19:34.798 --> 19:38.218
He's a mayor of a small town.
They don't have big fancy offices.

19:38.302 --> 19:40.679
He needs to be able to bring people over

19:40.762 --> 19:44.600
and not have an embarrassing space
that doesn't function.

19:44.683 --> 19:46.768
-Thank you.
-Next time I see you,

19:46.852 --> 19:48.145

-Not yet.

You see this face?

20:16.381 --> 20:17.382
Good-looking guy.

20:17.466 --> 20:22.888
It's because he is state champion
at speech in Georgia.

20:22.971 --> 20:25.766
-Awesome.
-I started when I was 14.

20:25.849 --> 20:29.353
I didn't know anything about speeches.
I was bad at public speaking,

20:29.436 --> 20:34.483
but when I practiced and I knew my speech,
I was confident I could deliver it.

20:34.566 --> 20:38.820
I thought it interesting to find someone
who's exceptional at speeches.

20:39.571 --> 20:42.115

20:42.199 --> 20:43.283
Okay.

20:43.367 --> 20:46.078
[Karamo]
I thought about the fact that you had said

20:46.161 --> 20:48.622
that older politicians
aren't respecting you enough,

20:48.705 --> 20:51.124
and part of that
comes from your speeches.

20:51.208 --> 20:53.043
-Would you agree?
-Uh, I agree.

20:53.126 --> 20:55.087
What stops you
from giving the best speech?

20:55.629 --> 20:58.882
Um, I think there's a little bit
of a stutter,

20:58.966 --> 20:59.967
-Mm-hm.
-Um...

21:00.050 --> 21:03.303
and probably it's more just the time
to, you know, get it memorized.

21:03.387 --> 21:06.640
Yeah, like, for these speeches
that I did to win state,

21:06.723 --> 21:09.393
I started practicing so much,
ahead of time.

21:09.476 --> 21:12.521
I started writing down speeches
and giving them to people.

21:13.981 --> 21:15.607
Practice, practice, practice.

21:15.691 --> 21:17.442

21:17.526 --> 21:19.987
I can talk about Clarkston all day long.

21:20.070 --> 21:24.032
But how can you talk about it in a way
that's engaging and exciting?

21:24.866 --> 21:27.035
-Yeah, I need help with that.
-Yes.

21:27.119 --> 21:31.373
He has to organize his thoughts
in a way that come across clear, fun,

21:31.456 --> 21:35.127
but also show that he is confident
about the work he is doing,

21:35.210 --> 21:36.878

21:36.962 --> 21:40.465
First, I wanna see your speech skills.

21:40.549 --> 21:42.968

21:43.051 --> 21:46.013

here, right?

21:46.513 --> 21:48.849
-So, you ready to go?
-Ready.

21:48.932 --> 21:50.350
[Karamo] Start.

21:50.434 --> 21:53.228

Let's do it.

22:37.898 --> 22:40.275
I put him on the spot and he is confident.

22:40.358 --> 22:41.485
Yeah.

22:41.985 --> 22:45.238
In any traditional rap battle,
back to back.

22:46.156 --> 22:48.950
You already swagged out with your jacket.
No, no, no.

22:49.034 --> 22:50.744
Swagged out now.

22:50.827 --> 22:52.496
This is about to be epic.

[laughing]

23:44.923 --> 23:46.049
What?

23:46.133 --> 23:49.594
But I give him two thumbs up
for doing such a good job.

23:49.678 --> 23:53.223
I know this was fun,
and I'm making a little bit light of it,

23:53.306 --> 23:54.850
but Joe's tips are real.

23:54.933 --> 23:58.770
I don't want you, especially with you
being a successful mayor,

23:58.854 --> 24:02.315
to get lost and not being confident
when you're giving speeches.

24:02.941 --> 24:06.862
You've gotta loosen up, be confident,
and you've got to practice.

24:06.945 --> 24:11.783
For this speech coming up for Friday,
you need to think about the rap battle

24:11.867 --> 24:14.536
and how you brought in the fun,
the looseness.

24:14.619 --> 24:18.415
You still were giving me facts.
We know you have it in you.

24:18.498 --> 24:22.502
I've seen the amazing work you've done.
You're pretty exceptional.

24:22.586 --> 24:24.504
-So...
-I would vote for you.

24:24.588 --> 24:27.215
-Look at that. Exactly.
-He'll be registered by then.

24:27.299 --> 24:29.092
He can vote. You got someone.

24:33.513 --> 24:36.349
[Tan] What do you love so much
about Clarkston?

24:36.433 --> 24:39.936
I love the food. I love the music.
I love the celebrations.

24:40.020 --> 24:42.731
-We don't just celebrate Christmas.
-Yeah.

24:42.814 --> 24:45.567
We celebrate Ramadan,
the Korean New Year,

24:45.650 --> 24:49.613
the Vietnamese Tet New Year, uh,
the Ethiopian Independence Day.

24:49.696 --> 24:53.366
It's really fun to see, you know,
young children

24:53.450 --> 24:55.660
in hijabs singing, uh, "Jingle Bells."

24:56.328 --> 24:58.663
Yeah, how does that make you feel

24:58.747 --> 25:02.751
when you have
such an ethnically diverse town,

25:02.834 --> 25:05.420
but the rest of your state isn't?

25:05.503 --> 25:07.172
There's always this concern

25:07.255 --> 25:10.383
that people are gonna show up
to cause trouble.

25:10.467 --> 25:12.010
-Yeah.
-It hasn't happened.

25:12.093 --> 25:17.682
Um, the people that are showing up
are showing up as almost a response

25:17.766 --> 25:21.102
to the anti-immigrant rhetoric.

25:21.186 --> 25:24.314
If we can figure out, you know,
how to make all of these religions,

25:24.397 --> 25:26.399
and we've got Muslims,
Christians, Buddhists,

25:26.483 --> 25:29.027
that are, you know,
living in proximity together

25:29.110 --> 25:34.032
and, you know, that to me is, that's like
our opportunity to lead by example.

25:34.115 --> 25:37.786
I can't change what's happening
outside of my city limits, in Clarkston,

25:37.869 --> 25:40.622
but I can change what's happening
in our 1.4 square miles.

25:40.705 --> 25:41.539
Good.

25:43.375 --> 25:46.628
I think this is gonna be perfect for you.
Come with me.

25:47.587 --> 25:49.798
How do you feel a store like this?

25:49.881 --> 25:53.551
Um... I usually go
for the clearance rack.

25:53.635 --> 25:58.348
I don't think they've got one in here,
that's the problem. [laughs]

25:59.266 --> 26:03.687
These guys, what they do well, is that
they do casual suiting, which I love.

26:03.770 --> 26:05.730
We call it a deconstructed suit.

26:05.814 --> 26:07.774
You could wear this
to a coffee shop.

26:07.857 --> 26:10.902
I wanna know, when I go and speak
to my local council member,

26:10.986 --> 26:14.447
that he's approachable.
What you wear does affect your job.

26:14.531 --> 26:17.450
What you wear does encourage people
to treat you a certain way.

26:17.534 --> 26:20.662
-Looks great. Like it.
-Good. It's a really lightweight denim,

26:20.745 --> 26:25.166
so, it's not going to be too stuffy
when you're in your hot weather.

26:25.250 --> 26:28.295
I wouldn't want you to be
too uncomfortable.

26:28.378 --> 26:32.799
Pants. Even though I can tell
you work out, you take care of yourself,

26:32.882 --> 26:35.927
Don't go too skinny. Constituents
aren't looking for a fashionista.

26:36.011 --> 26:37.971
They want to take you seriously.

26:38.054 --> 26:40.473
Go for a simple color.

26:40.557 --> 26:43.184
It's got a straight leg, not too skinny.

26:43.268 --> 26:46.855
Go for a solid. Go for a gray,
go for a black, go for a blue.

26:46.938 --> 26:50.692
I want you to strike a balance
between casual and formal,

26:50.775 --> 26:52.277
-and this is how.
-Okay.

26:52.360 --> 26:56.281
Keep it simple, a simple closet,
then whatever you put on is easy.

26:56.364 --> 26:59.367
I'm a politician,
so, gotta be not as complicated.

26:59.451 --> 27:02.829
-Yeah. Yeah, you know I know.
-You know I know.

27:03.788 --> 27:07.250
You only had two pairs
of shoes, but you now have a third.

27:07.917 --> 27:12.005
-Oh, yeah, these are my running shoes.
-Okay, so there's a third.

27:12.088 --> 27:17.594
I got you brown, and I got you a black
that makes sense for you.

27:17.677 --> 27:21.514
It's got a lovely round toe.
It's nothing too chunky.

27:21.598 --> 27:24.559
With a black or navy suit,
these will go perfectly.

27:24.642 --> 27:26.895
I'll make sure his closet
makes sense for him--

27:26.978 --> 27:28.938
Give me a shout if you need help.

27:29.022 --> 27:32.942
--and is so good that he can't help
but love what he's wearing,

27:33.026 --> 27:34.152
and feel comfortable.

27:34.819 --> 27:36.571
-How you doing?
-I'm ready.

27:36.654 --> 27:38.698
Take a look in the mirror for me.

27:40.116 --> 27:42.369
Your jeans are now an appropriate length.

27:42.452 --> 27:44.788
-It looks like a more formal jean.
-I like it.

27:44.871 --> 27:47.624
I haven't worn black shoes in years,
so this looks odd.

27:47.707 --> 27:49.959
Yeah. [laughs] All right,
we'll build up to it.

27:50.043 --> 27:54.214
We've given you a shirt that adds a layer,
but you can take it off.

27:54.297 --> 27:57.634
And then I want you to
throw on this blazer with this.

27:57.717 --> 27:59.552
-It feels good. Um...
-Yeah.

28:00.303 --> 28:02.764
-Yeah, it seems just a little bit more...
-Dressed up.

28:02.847 --> 28:04.891
Little more dressed up.
Do I button it?

28:04.974 --> 28:06.393
I would leave it open.

28:06.476 --> 28:09.270
I always feel like
I wanna be comfortable in a suit,

28:09.354 --> 28:12.190
so, it's already so restrictive,
I leave it open.

28:12.941 --> 28:15.193
I actually think it's appropriate
for a meeting.

28:15.276 --> 28:19.239
Like, nothing super senior,
but for something like, let's say,

28:19.322 --> 28:22.242
a Friday evening gathering at your house.

28:22.325 --> 28:25.787
A button-up under this would be beautiful.

28:25.870 --> 28:28.373
Throw on jeans, appropriate,
as long as you've got this.

28:28.456 --> 28:30.750
-I like this a lot.
-Good. Okay, good.

29:00.655 --> 29:03.074
-Hi. How are you, Ted?
-Hey. Very good.

29:03.158 --> 29:05.452
-Good to see you. How's your day?
-Good to see you.

29:05.535 --> 29:08.955
Ted Terry's approach to politics
is all about love and compassion

29:09.038 --> 29:10.498
and putting other people first,

29:10.582 --> 29:13.376
but I need him to apply that
to his face.

29:14.043 --> 29:17.756
So, this is your hair,
and then this is your beard.

29:17.839 --> 29:18.715
Yes.

29:18.798 --> 29:19.799
[laughs]

29:19.883 --> 29:21.801
What are we gonna do with him?

29:21.885 --> 29:25.513
-Jonathan, what are you thinking?
-I think we should take it.

29:25.597 --> 29:28.933
Ladies, mayor of Clarkston, Georgia,
it's a gorgeous little town.

29:29.017 --> 29:31.478
He's had this beard, what do we think?

29:33.438 --> 29:36.858
-I'm kind of curious to see it gone.
-Really?

29:36.941 --> 29:38.067
[woman] Yeah.

29:38.443 --> 29:42.113
I wouldn't mind a little scruff,
but the beard is scraggly.

29:42.197 --> 29:45.742
He has pretty eyes, and you notice
the beard now, instead of the eyes.

29:46.576 --> 29:47.911
[Ted] Oh, I don't know. Um...

29:47.994 --> 29:51.331
But this hair in general,
like, having such length on top

29:51.414 --> 29:55.168
and then such a short tight on the side,
it's a bit edgy.

29:55.251 --> 29:59.088
But you can be an edgy mayor.
I support you being an edgy mayor.

29:59.172 --> 30:02.342
Let's make it a little less mountain man.
Let's do it.

30:03.551 --> 30:05.887
My, gosh, find that beard.

30:07.013 --> 30:11.434
He has a nice face. It's a face
and a smile that draws people in.

30:11.518 --> 30:14.521
He needs to appeal
to the people that are voting.

30:14.604 --> 30:16.397
Yeah, it's delegation.

30:16.481 --> 30:18.691
Choke on this shape.

30:19.317 --> 30:23.279
We're giving you Jake Gyllenhaal vibes
except for blond, but I love that.

30:23.363 --> 30:26.199
This is now a man that can smile
and look you in the eyes

30:26.282 --> 30:28.117
and there's nothing to hide behind.

30:28.201 --> 30:29.786
Yeah.

30:29.869 --> 30:32.705
He doesn't have to be afraid
anyone's judging him for his look.

30:32.789 --> 30:34.707
He can reach across
and make friends

30:34.791 --> 30:37.585
and continue to do
the amazing work he's doing.

30:38.253 --> 30:41.256
Andrea knew what she was doing
when she married you.

30:41.339 --> 30:43.883
-We're not married. [laughs]
-Oh, yeah, I forgot.

30:43.967 --> 30:46.344
I mean, she has a title, it's mayoress.

30:46.427 --> 30:49.305
-Oh, my God, it is? Is that official?
-Like a baroness.

30:49.389 --> 30:52.392
Did the townspeople of Clarkston
decide this?

30:52.475 --> 30:53.726
[Ted laughing]

30:53.935 --> 30:56.396
Sorry that I'm really hitting society's,

30:56.479 --> 30:59.983
like, hideous expectations
of hetero couples on you.

31:00.066 --> 31:01.860
I'm so sorry,
I'm not doing it anymore.

31:03.403 --> 31:07.198
I feel like you're giving me
Governor Ted Terry right now.

31:07.282 --> 31:10.034
Not that crazy baby hipster beard.

31:11.160 --> 31:12.453
I've been liberated.

31:13.079 --> 31:16.207
Okay, so,
resistance beard is on the ground.

31:16.291 --> 31:19.919
He lived his best life,
but are you ready to see your new you?

31:20.003 --> 31:21.212
-I'm ready.
-Here you go.

31:22.297 --> 31:23.214
Bam.

31:23.798 --> 31:25.758
-I love it. Looks great.
-You do?

31:25.842 --> 31:29.929
I think he looks amazing.
He looks young, fresh, he looks confident.

31:30.013 --> 31:33.433
-Professional, but edgy.
-Like a gorgeous mayor should.

31:33.516 --> 31:35.226
Total transformation.

31:35.310 --> 31:37.854
-Wouldn't you vote for him? Right?
-Yes.

31:37.937 --> 31:40.899
-Thanks, Jonathan.
-You're welcome. Yes.

31:40.982 --> 31:43.526
-I think Andrea will like it.
-She will. Yes.

31:44.193 --> 31:45.695
Yes!

31:45.778 --> 31:49.032
Get out. You look gorgeous.
I'm obsessed with you.

31:49.115 --> 31:51.075
I can't wait to see you
tomorrow.

31:51.159 --> 31:52.368
[pop music playing]

32:04.839 --> 32:06.049
[truck horn honking]

32:06.132 --> 32:09.302
-[Bobby] Oh, boy.
-[Karamo] I hear Teddy honking.

32:09.385 --> 32:11.346
[Jonathan] I love this covert operation.

32:12.013 --> 32:14.474
-[Ted] Ready to see this?
-Ready. Let's do it.

32:16.768 --> 32:18.686
It is amazing. I promise you.

32:19.354 --> 32:22.065
-Hello. Come on through.
-Hi, Mayor Terry.

32:23.483 --> 32:24.984
Whoa.

32:25.735 --> 32:27.153
This is nice.

32:29.322 --> 32:31.950
[Bobby] You've got plenty of room
to entertain in here now.

32:32.033 --> 32:35.411
But also, too, you got all the natures
of, like, element.

32:35.495 --> 32:38.998
You got fire. You got plants,
you got water, you got couch.

32:39.082 --> 32:42.543
You got wood. You have everything. Yes.

32:44.629 --> 32:47.090
[Karamo] Oh, my gosh.
Your look is amazing.

32:47.173 --> 32:49.425
-I have a face.
-You're very handsome.

32:49.509 --> 32:52.345
-And a lovely face.
-[Bobby] Wanna see the rest of it?

32:53.680 --> 32:56.265
-Oh, this is a dining room.
-Yes.

32:59.143 --> 33:01.938
Now you have a place
that you can have constituents over,

33:02.021 --> 33:04.899
embassy officials, all those people.

33:04.983 --> 33:08.528
-Embassy officials.
-Yes, yes, embassy officials.

33:08.611 --> 33:11.072
Do you also notice something
different about this room?

33:11.739 --> 33:15.076
-[Ted] I don't know.
-Dude! There used to be a closet there.

33:15.159 --> 33:17.370
-Oh, that's right.
-[Karamo] There's no closet.

33:17.453 --> 33:20.415
[Bobby] Went like
the Republican Health Care Bill. Poof.

33:20.498 --> 33:22.667
Notice anything different
in your kitchen?

33:23.334 --> 33:25.586
-[Ted] Yeah. The backsplash.
-Thank you.

33:25.670 --> 33:30.091
Andrea has been wanting a backsplash.
It looks like a brand-new home.

33:30.174 --> 33:32.176
-It really does.
-Oh, my God, I do...

33:32.260 --> 33:33.386
Aw...

33:36.389 --> 33:39.600
Listen, we're just gonna clap
for you all day.

33:39.684 --> 33:41.352
Yes, governor.

33:41.436 --> 33:45.148
-He is the mayor.
-No, he's gonna do-- It's aspirational.

33:45.231 --> 33:47.567
Yes, aspirational. Governor, yeah.
Future governor.

33:47.650 --> 33:49.902
Are you ready to see some more?

33:49.986 --> 33:51.112
-Yeah.
-[Jonathan] Yes.

33:52.530 --> 33:53.406
[Ted] Whoa.

33:53.489 --> 33:56.284
[Bobby] So, notice we put
whole new wall treatments.

33:56.367 --> 33:59.704
New bed, new mattress.
Painted the wall and the ceiling.

33:59.787 --> 34:01.205
We added all this wood detail.

34:01.289 --> 34:03.458
[Jonathan] Is this color
called Sexual Healing?

34:05.585 --> 34:07.253
My favorite feature of this room is,

34:07.336 --> 34:09.505
remember the closet
in the dining room was gone?

34:09.589 --> 34:11.632
-Yes. It's back here?
-Now it's back here.

34:12.508 --> 34:14.385
-Hey.
-What?

34:14.469 --> 34:17.680
[Bobby] Andrea is totally
gonna kick you out of this closet.

34:17.805 --> 34:19.265
[both laughing]

34:20.850 --> 34:23.436
I'll share it with her. This is awesome.

34:23.519 --> 34:27.106
I will definitely keep this organized,
now that I know how.

34:27.190 --> 34:31.694
Now we have a true mayor office.

34:34.781 --> 34:37.325
-My favorite thing about this room...
-[Ted] Oh, my gosh.

34:37.992 --> 34:41.204
-is your shoes.
-These are the shoes. Oh, my gosh.

34:41.287 --> 34:43.748
I think this is amazing. I, uh...

34:43.831 --> 34:47.794
Yeah, I'm at a loss for words, Bobby,
this is really great.

34:50.379 --> 34:54.008
Hi, look at your gorgeous bathroom.
Here it is.

34:54.092 --> 35:00.348
If it's daytime, we need sunscreen.
It's all you need, all over your face.

35:00.431 --> 35:03.392
If you're doing a telly interview,
polish it up

35:03.476 --> 35:05.311
so, you don't look sweaty.

35:05.394 --> 35:07.522
Just put it all over your face and neck

35:07.605 --> 35:10.566
and it keeps you from looking sweaty,
which I'm obsessed with.

35:10.650 --> 35:12.485
Keeping your face clean-shaven,

35:12.568 --> 35:15.446
you wanna have a razor
that has very, very close blades,

35:15.530 --> 35:18.032
'cause that reduces the friction
or catching of skin.

35:18.116 --> 35:22.453
This shave cream has spearmint in it,
which will help lift up the hairs.

35:22.537 --> 35:25.748
Then when you're done shaving,
hit it with cold water.

35:25.832 --> 35:29.627
That closes your pores,
and it tells everything to calm down.

35:29.710 --> 35:34.757
Also, I got you this texture hair spray.
A lot of hair sprays live on the hair.

35:34.841 --> 35:37.677
This lives in between it,
so it creates texture.

35:37.760 --> 35:39.178
Give it a little look.

35:39.262 --> 35:42.223
See how it gives you
a bit of a piecy-ness? Love.

35:43.724 --> 35:47.270
So, first,
if you're going on a more formal evening,

35:47.353 --> 35:49.438
with people you have to impress--

35:49.522 --> 35:51.899
They're not gonna be impressed
by cool-boy clothes.

35:51.983 --> 35:55.403
You've got long sleeve options
that are great for a suit,

35:55.486 --> 35:59.157
or great tucked into pants with a tie,
I don't expect you to wear suits daily.

35:59.240 --> 36:02.952
Then the rest of this--
You are the hipster mayor,

36:03.035 --> 36:05.413
the last thing you wanna do is
be super formal

36:05.496 --> 36:07.248
and you're not approachable,

36:07.331 --> 36:09.667
so, I got you great options
that still look like

36:09.750 --> 36:12.420
your clothes are clean,
well put together, and tidy.

36:12.503 --> 36:16.757
Yeah, I like the blue
and the versatility of the shirts.

36:16.841 --> 36:18.134
[Tan] Next, footwear.

36:18.217 --> 36:21.262
Because you're not the biggest fan
of black shoes.

36:22.221 --> 36:24.891
-I saw the black shoes and I was like...
-I know.

36:24.974 --> 36:28.186
But I never wear them, so,
it's kind of like the beard being gone.

36:28.269 --> 36:29.562
I'm like, it's new, but...

36:29.645 --> 36:32.899
The more you wear it,
the more you become accustomed to it.

36:32.982 --> 36:36.319
Every man should have a black shoe.
So you ready to try on some looks?

36:36.402 --> 36:37.570
Yeah.

36:38.070 --> 36:39.906
Okay, boys. Ted, come on out.

36:41.240 --> 36:42.742
[all shouting]

36:43.743 --> 36:48.623
-Got his pants leg rolled up.
-We've gone for a more casual look.

36:48.706 --> 36:51.209
He could wear this
to meetings at a coffee shop,

36:51.292 --> 36:52.251
somewhere casual.

36:52.335 --> 36:54.212
It's all linen,
it's nice and breathable.

36:54.295 --> 36:56.422
This is something he can
be comfortable in.

36:56.505 --> 36:58.257
-Flip burgers, hold babies.
-Yeah.

36:58.341 --> 37:01.677
What happens if you take that jacket...
off?

37:01.761 --> 37:04.096
He could take this off.
Let's take the jacket off.

37:04.180 --> 37:07.934
Karamo and I worked on a bag for you.
Let me show you this.

37:08.017 --> 37:09.477
It's slick.

37:09.560 --> 37:12.521
It's sophisticated. It's more mature.

37:12.605 --> 37:15.358
-You look amazing.
-I feel good.

37:15.441 --> 37:17.443
You're all mine now.

37:18.319 --> 37:20.154
It's light summer fare tonight.

37:20.238 --> 37:23.115
I got you some red wine and white wine,
there's a chardonnay,

37:23.199 --> 37:25.534
it's gonna go beautifully
with asparagus and salmon,

37:25.618 --> 37:27.495
and, uh, with grilled peaches,
as well.

37:27.578 --> 37:31.123
So, we're making
a summer grilled peach salad

37:31.207 --> 37:33.376
with heirloom tomatoes.

37:34.001 --> 37:37.713
So, you cut down this natural line
that occurs right over here in the peach.

37:38.589 --> 37:41.592
Named doughnut peaches 'cause they
look like little baby doughnuts.

37:41.676 --> 37:44.470
These heirloom tomatoes,
you're gonna cut them into wedges,

37:44.553 --> 37:48.182
kind of like these guys, and arrange them
on a plate, consecutively.

37:48.724 --> 37:51.060
So, now with our tongs, you grab these,

37:51.143 --> 37:56.524
and on a super-hot top, beautiful sizzle,
we lay these out right here.

37:56.607 --> 38:00.111
Basil, from your garden,
and then you just roll them up,

38:00.194 --> 38:03.447
-so that they look like a little...
-Joint.

38:03.531 --> 38:05.741
-Thank you.
-We're cool here.

38:05.825 --> 38:07.034
Okay, cool. Awesome.

38:07.118 --> 38:10.705
So, take a nice sharp knife,
and then you go at it like this.

38:10.788 --> 38:14.417
You're gonna take your basil,
sprinkle a little bit on.

38:14.500 --> 38:19.505
A bit of Parmesan, add a bit of
seasoning salt, pepper, and the olive oil.

38:19.588 --> 38:22.508
Grab a piece of almond or two, and try.

38:26.595 --> 38:28.639
-It's amazing.
-It's pretty damn good, right?

38:29.807 --> 38:31.559
[Karamo] Hey, Tan, come on out here.

38:31.642 --> 38:34.603
Who is this gorgeous man in front of me?
I don't even remember.

38:34.687 --> 38:36.188
-You look amazing.
-Thank you.

38:36.272 --> 38:40.401
From the moment that we jumped out
the back of that truck and saw you,

38:40.484 --> 38:44.905
to where you are standing right now,
it's completely two different men.

38:45.990 --> 38:49.618
Just the confidence. You just radiate it.

38:50.786 --> 38:53.289
This week's been great,
and I'm proud of Clarkston,

38:53.372 --> 38:56.959
but now I'm proud of my home,
I'm proud of my food I'm gonna serve,

38:57.043 --> 39:01.380
um, and then how I look, and then,
got some good things I wanna say,

39:01.464 --> 39:06.093
concise and to the point,
but to be inspirational and, you know,

39:06.177 --> 39:10.097
really try to use this opportunity
to build relationships.

39:10.181 --> 39:13.809
Thank you so much for everything.
Good luck tonight. You'll be fantastic.

39:13.893 --> 39:18.147
-Oh, thank you, governor. Senator.
-I want you and John to storm the senate.

39:18.230 --> 39:20.232
You and John storm the senate,
you got this.

39:20.316 --> 39:24.236
-Have fun tonight.
-Have fun. You're gonna be great.

39:24.320 --> 39:28.574
-Have fun tonight.
-Remember everything I told you.

39:28.657 --> 39:31.786
-Pomade.
-Pomade, pomade, pomade. Bye.

39:43.506 --> 39:45.758
-You wanna take a selfie with me?
-Yes.

39:46.717 --> 39:49.970
[Karamo] Guys, seriously, this couple
could live in Ted Terry's town.

39:50.054 --> 39:51.180
-[Tan] They could.
-Right?

39:51.263 --> 39:52.223
We'd be welcome.

39:52.306 --> 39:55.393
My little homage to Ted today,
blueberries and whipped cream.

39:55.476 --> 39:57.603
[Karamo] Can we see what happened
at Ted's meal?

39:57.686 --> 39:59.438
-You wanna get in?
-Yeah.

40:00.689 --> 40:02.108
[Ted laughing]

40:03.943 --> 40:05.069
-Hi.
-Welcome home.

40:05.152 --> 40:06.779
Look at you.

40:06.862 --> 40:08.823
Let me see, all around.

40:10.282 --> 40:12.785
I love this whole outfit.
It looks so good.

40:13.953 --> 40:14.995
He does look good.

40:15.079 --> 40:16.455
And see the bedroom.

40:17.623 --> 40:20.709
[Andrea] Oh, my gosh. This is so cool.

40:20.793 --> 40:24.046
-And this is...
-And this is the closet. This is...

40:24.130 --> 40:27.133
-This is really exciting.
-[Tan] Show off the closet.

40:27.216 --> 40:28.384
Dum, dum, dum!

40:28.467 --> 40:31.345
-Tan organized the heck out of this.
-He decked it out.

40:31.429 --> 40:34.473
Oh, and he got you a special gift also
for tonight.

40:34.557 --> 40:35.599
Ooh.

40:35.683 --> 40:37.810
-This is your dress.
-[Tan] It's gorgeous.

40:37.893 --> 40:40.521
-She has to love that.
-[Ted] These are your shoes.

40:40.604 --> 40:43.149
My God. They're gold.
He got me gold shoes.

40:43.232 --> 40:45.192
I love gold shoes.

40:45.276 --> 40:46.819
Oh, this is fantastic.

40:46.902 --> 40:48.362
-Cute.
-Gorgeous.

40:48.446 --> 40:51.115
-Shall we get cooking?
-We got an hour and ten minutes.

40:54.243 --> 40:56.745
-Some sweet potatoes.
-[Antoni] She's preparing salmon.

40:56.829 --> 40:59.999
-They each have their own dishes.
-[Andrea] Tell me what you're making.

41:00.082 --> 41:03.586
-Supposed to be grilling them.
-Oh, that sounds so good.

41:03.669 --> 41:06.297
It's cute that now they can cook together.

41:06.380 --> 41:08.966
-That's adorable.
-It's sexy, is what it is.

41:19.310 --> 41:23.689
I'm excited they have a proper
dining table, so they can host this party.

41:23.772 --> 41:24.690
Proper is the word.

41:26.859 --> 41:30.237
-You okay? You seem like, uh...
-Yeah, I just, uh...

41:34.200 --> 41:37.703
-Trying to just get this right.
-Okay. It's gonna be fine.

41:38.412 --> 41:41.624
You need to relax.
You're, like, all anxious.

41:41.707 --> 41:43.042
[groans]

41:44.001 --> 41:46.545
-All right, so, I'm gonna wear this.
-Okay.

41:46.629 --> 41:48.756
-With these pants.
-That'll be great.

41:48.839 --> 41:51.550
Tan was like, "Don't wear that belt,"
so, I won't.

41:52.843 --> 41:55.513
-Look how sharp he is.
-He's wearing sneakers.

41:55.596 --> 41:57.431
I didn't encourage him to wear sneakers.

41:58.182 --> 42:00.434
He's balancing it out with a blazer.
I'm fine.

42:00.518 --> 42:03.479
-[Jonathan] He's really cute.
-He looks fantastic.

42:03.562 --> 42:06.357
-How do I look?
-Oh, you look so good.

42:06.440 --> 42:08.400
-His shoes are so cool.
-Good job, Tan.

42:08.484 --> 42:09.693
Yeah, he is.

42:10.569 --> 42:12.154
[doorbell rings]

42:12.571 --> 42:15.074
-Hello, how are you, Cynthia?
-Hello.

42:15.157 --> 42:18.661
-Mayor Ted, nice to meet you.
-Ted? You look younger than I thought.

42:18.744 --> 42:21.956
Yeah, I'm one of the youngest mayors
in Georgia.

42:22.039 --> 42:24.250
-Nice meeting you, Ted.
-This is Andrea.

42:24.333 --> 42:26.919
-Hi, Cynthia.
-Hello, Andrea. How are you?

42:27.002 --> 42:28.462
Hello, Mr. Mayor.

42:28.546 --> 42:30.506
-Check him out with his sheer shirt.
-Cute.

42:30.589 --> 42:33.425
May I present my assistant here, Marina.

42:33.509 --> 42:36.303
Marina, Mayor Ted. Nice to meet you.

42:36.387 --> 42:38.347
Well, come on in.
That's Andrea, over there.

42:38.430 --> 42:41.308
-I was thinking of an elderly guy.
-Yeah.

42:41.392 --> 42:42.309
[laughing]

42:44.728 --> 42:49.650
So, I made this from scratch.
I got a lot of coaching on it.

42:49.733 --> 42:53.279
-Oh, my gosh, this is such a treat.
-He's about to give a toast.

42:53.362 --> 42:56.699
First off, I wanna say thank you so much
for being here.

42:56.782 --> 43:01.120
Clarkston wasn't always welcoming
to refugees and immigrants,

43:01.203 --> 43:04.498
and I think the community
has always been very open,

43:04.582 --> 43:06.333
but the political leaders haven't.

43:06.417 --> 43:11.297
And one of the first resolutions I signed
was a welcoming resolution,

43:11.380 --> 43:15.092
to say that we believe there is strength
and compassion and love

43:15.175 --> 43:17.303
and that we welcome all here.

43:17.386 --> 43:22.266
We are proof that immigrants and refugees
can make a community stronger.

43:22.349 --> 43:24.476
If we work together
and learn from each other,

43:24.560 --> 43:28.522
then we can create
a more peaceful, prosperous world.

43:28.606 --> 43:34.194
And I just wanna say that I look forward
to finding ways for us to come together.

43:34.278 --> 43:35.613
Thank you. Thank you.

43:35.696 --> 43:38.699
We wanna toast to the mayor
and the mayoress,

43:38.782 --> 43:42.828
for all the things that they're doing here
in Clarkston, Georgia.

43:42.911 --> 43:45.122
-[Cynthia] Yes.
-[Karamo] Look at that.

43:48.542 --> 43:50.669
-Aw.
-This is what America's about.

43:50.753 --> 43:52.504
[Jonathan] It should be welcoming,

43:52.588 --> 43:55.090
it's heartbreaking
that's not where it is.

43:55.174 --> 43:58.344
But thank God there is, like,
a little beacon of gorgeousness

43:58.427 --> 44:00.137
30 minutes away, honey.

44:00.220 --> 44:02.264
I love how impressed they are.

44:02.348 --> 44:07.686
It's so refreshing, we see
a town like Clarkston, being welcoming

44:07.770 --> 44:11.982
to a lot of different nationalities,
and doing this.

44:12.066 --> 44:15.235
-In the middle of the South.
-[Cynthia] Yeah, yeah.

44:15.319 --> 44:19.698
And I think you are the future leaders
of the United States.

44:19.782 --> 44:25.329
And I think you should continue that path
to where we should be going

44:25.412 --> 44:28.123
as we move on
with the United States of America.

44:28.207 --> 44:29.124
Yeah.

44:29.500 --> 44:31.001
Well said, well said.

44:31.085 --> 44:33.879
-Bravo, mayor.
-That was really good.

44:33.962 --> 44:37.091
[Ted] Everyone should find ways
to push their comfort zones

44:37.174 --> 44:39.510
and to try new things
and be open-minded

44:39.593 --> 44:41.720
because you never know
how it's gonna turn out.

44:41.804 --> 44:45.974
If I had resisted any of this,
it wouldn't have turned out as great.

44:46.058 --> 44:48.560
-Thanks so much for coming.
-Thank you very much.

44:48.644 --> 44:50.813
-So nice to meet you.
-Lovely.

44:50.896 --> 44:53.482
-We'll be in touch.
-Looking forward to it. Thank you.

44:53.565 --> 44:56.151
Sometimes you have to let
five gay guys into your life

44:56.235 --> 44:58.821
and see what happens. [laughing]

44:58.904 --> 45:02.783
-Can we all give cheers to Mayor Ted?
-To Mayor Ted.

45:10.958 --> 45:14.586
When entertaining, it's about
clever innuendo and planning.

45:14.670 --> 45:19.383
At the end of my dinner parties, I like
to serve a proper coffee and tea service.

45:19.466 --> 45:22.469
It tells guests,
I'm sophisticated and thoughtful,

45:22.553 --> 45:26.140
but it also says, perhaps it's time to go.
