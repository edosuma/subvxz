00:26.318 --> 00:27.592
Synchro: mpm

00:30.948 --> 00:32.781
<i>That's the guy
you want with the ball.</i>

00:32.951 --> 00:36.180
Come on! God, you want to be
a loser all your life?

00:36.305 --> 00:38.428
- Were you talking to me?
- No, the Redskins.

00:38.553 --> 00:40.447
You're performing at
or near expectations.

00:40.572 --> 00:42.859
I'm back
from the chemistry olympiad!

00:42.984 --> 00:44.544
I got a platinum metal.

00:44.669 --> 00:46.269
That's terrific honey.

00:46.394 --> 00:48.660
You're mommy's little brain-haver.

00:48.785 --> 00:50.571
So, what's that?
You got first place?

00:50.696 --> 00:54.696
No, platinum is seventy-eighth, the same
as its place in the periodic table.

00:54.962 --> 00:55.956
So, you lost.

00:56.081 --> 00:59.965
You can't really expect a non-Korean
to place higher than cobalt.

01:00.277 --> 01:03.000
- But check it out!
- Fumble! Loser!

01:03.125 --> 01:04.806
That guy just cost us the game!

01:04.931 --> 01:06.819
I assume he'll be killing himself
tonight.

01:06.944 --> 01:08.818
- ! Look at...
- I know what you're thinking.

01:08.986 --> 01:11.562
You prefer he be dragged
through the streets, mob justice.

01:11.687 --> 01:14.114
That's a legitimate view.
It's not mine, but I respect it.

01:14.284 --> 01:17.926
- Platinum is used as a catalyst...
- I'm sorry, Steve, you lost me.

01:18.051 --> 01:20.711
I guess that's the second thing
you lost today.

01:20.836 --> 01:23.036
No and my respect, that's three.

01:23.418 --> 01:24.518
Wait, Steve.

01:24.728 --> 01:26.627
Your keys, you also lost your keys.

01:26.796 --> 01:29.444
That's four.
Four times a loser.

01:30.946 --> 01:31.755
Five.

01:32.968 --> 01:35.730
So I says, "half the petty officers
in the seventh fleet

01:35.855 --> 01:37.675
"could've fathered that kid.
Why am I the one

01:37.800 --> 01:39.766
"that's got to pay
to fix his cleft palate?"

01:39.891 --> 01:41.222
But the whole thing was messy

01:41.347 --> 01:44.323
so I jumped ship in Okinawa, caught
a flight home, got back last night.

01:44.448 --> 01:45.938
Anyhoo what's got you so glum?

01:46.106 --> 01:46.920
It's Dad.

01:47.045 --> 01:49.191
He always ignores me,
'cause I never win anything.

01:50.088 --> 01:53.070
How to get your dad's attention.
That is a tough one.

01:53.309 --> 01:56.179
A lot of kids are starting fires
these days. Maybe that would work.

01:56.304 --> 01:58.789
That's not the kind of attention
I mean.

01:59.328 --> 02:01.245
Maybe you should
just give up on your dad.

02:01.457 --> 02:03.978
Face it, he's a douche.
And I would know.

02:04.103 --> 02:06.537
I used to run human resources
for Summer's Eve.

02:06.662 --> 02:10.205
Great company, they would throw a family
day picnic at six flags every year.

02:11.262 --> 02:14.258
Were those good times.
Boy, did we look forward to those.

02:15.802 --> 02:17.648
Wait a second, that's it!

02:18.288 --> 02:20.951
I can sign up
for the footballs team!

02:21.076 --> 02:23.893
Dad loves sports!
I bet he'd love to watch me play.

02:24.134 --> 02:26.194
Steve, look at those kids.
They're athletes.

02:26.319 --> 02:28.251
When was the last time
you ran anywhere?

02:28.376 --> 02:30.900
I mean with your actual legs,
not by pressing "X".

02:31.069 --> 02:33.792
That doesn't matter, look!
It says right here, see?

02:33.917 --> 02:36.924
"All players on each team
must play in every game."

02:37.049 --> 02:38.349
Everybody plays!

02:38.605 --> 02:40.522
I'm going to play football.

02:40.671 --> 02:43.121
Dad will have to pay attention
to that!

02:45.451 --> 02:48.219
Okay, football's your plan.
I get it, but this is here.

02:48.344 --> 02:50.115
Low-hanging fruit if you need it.

02:54.459 --> 02:55.459
Oh, father?

02:55.709 --> 02:58.474
I was wondering if you might sign
something for me.

02:58.765 --> 03:01.199
It's a permission slip
for junior football!

03:01.324 --> 03:02.724
"Junior football"!

03:02.849 --> 03:05.810
Why, you've never done anything
that required medical permission!

03:06.292 --> 03:09.041
You're damn right I won't sue
if you're paralyzed.

03:12.122 --> 03:14.552
Steve, there's something
I'd like to give you.

03:14.677 --> 03:16.237
It's my old, protective cup.

03:16.405 --> 03:19.073
I whittled it myself
out of a solid bough of oak.

03:19.357 --> 03:20.855
Now, I want you to wear it.

03:23.070 --> 03:25.788
Dad, are we having
a father/son moment?

03:25.957 --> 03:27.907
We were.
You ruined it by mentioning it.

03:28.719 --> 03:29.917
Splinter.

03:30.330 --> 03:32.770
I like the way you're putting him
through his groin drills.

03:32.895 --> 03:35.372
"A sturdy groin
is the linchpin of victory."

03:35.634 --> 03:36.948
Vince Lombardi said that.

03:37.073 --> 03:39.093
And he would have loved
your mauve sweat suit.

03:39.265 --> 03:42.429
You know, we need more coaches.
Can I sign you up, Mr...?

03:42.598 --> 03:44.473
Smith, Stan Smith, and you sure can!

03:44.642 --> 03:47.176
- I'll coach my boy's team!
- You called me your boy!

03:47.780 --> 03:48.978
Quit ruining moments!

03:51.742 --> 03:53.134
Mom, please, enough.

03:53.259 --> 03:56.717
If I have one more piece of vomit pie
I'm going to pumpkin.

03:56.842 --> 03:58.482
One more. Taste it.

03:58.607 --> 03:59.721
And be harsh.

04:00.657 --> 04:02.357
Mom, your pies are fine.

04:02.535 --> 04:05.435
"Fine" won't wow the judges
at the county fair.

04:05.603 --> 04:09.603
And "fine" certainly won't beat
Miss Carlotta Monterey's pie.

04:10.086 --> 04:11.876
Is there a Carlotta Monterey pie
here?

04:12.138 --> 04:13.495
Nope, still Mom's.

04:14.541 --> 04:18.541
You know Carlotta Monterey doesn't
even show up to pick up her prizes?

04:18.887 --> 04:20.451
She submits a self-addressed,

04:20.576 --> 04:23.237
blue ribbon-sized envelope
along with her pie.

04:23.539 --> 04:25.472
That cocky pie-skank.

04:25.689 --> 04:29.369
This whole business of baking contests
for women is so 1950s.

04:29.494 --> 04:32.021
Why don't you give back your right
to vote while your at it, mom?

04:33.115 --> 04:34.265
I don't vote.

04:34.567 --> 04:36.217
It's just so confusing.

04:36.484 --> 04:39.292
I go into the booth,
pull the curtain and count to ten.

04:39.417 --> 04:42.758
Then I come out, yell "democracy"
and run to my car.

04:45.295 --> 04:46.744
Heslop! Dunnigan!
Smith!

04:49.373 --> 04:51.373
Nice work, Heslop!
Good grab, Dunnigan.

04:52.198 --> 04:53.398
That's my dad.

04:53.523 --> 04:55.563
Just getting the hang of it, coach!

04:55.688 --> 04:58.380
Be careful, Steve.
There's a man throwing things!

04:58.549 --> 04:59.499
Chubs!

05:00.884 --> 05:02.567
All right, huddle up, Wolverines!

05:02.692 --> 05:05.042
Boys and girl...
You're a girl, right?

05:05.639 --> 05:06.758
This country.

05:06.883 --> 05:09.244
All right, listen up...
we've got our first game next week.

05:09.369 --> 05:10.991
- What are we going to do?
- Win!

05:11.116 --> 05:13.862
That's right, now, take a lap!
Steve, hold up son.

05:13.987 --> 05:17.231
Did you see me out there, Dad?
I was really making some great tries.

05:17.356 --> 05:20.040
Son, do you want the Wolverines
to win next week?

05:20.238 --> 05:21.238
I sure do!

05:21.363 --> 05:23.293
Me, too.
That's why i'm cutting you.

05:23.418 --> 05:25.267
- What?
- Yeah, and your fat-ass friend.

05:25.392 --> 05:26.655
I'm keeping the girl.

05:26.780 --> 05:28.744
I don't want to hurt her feelings,
she's a girl.

05:29.123 --> 05:30.412
You're cutting me?

05:30.586 --> 05:33.830
Here's the thing.
I've been scouting you your entire life.

05:33.955 --> 05:37.200
And I mean this factually,
not judgmentally, you're a loser.

05:37.325 --> 05:38.775
You lose at things.

05:39.160 --> 05:42.068
But, hey, here's a chance
for you to help us win.

05:42.193 --> 05:44.117
By not playing!
High-five!

05:45.885 --> 05:46.885
Too slow!

05:48.586 --> 05:50.474
You got to make yourself laugh,
you know?

06:05.958 --> 06:07.808
- Wha... whazzit?
- Roger?

06:09.483 --> 06:11.733
Oh, God, can't a guy sleep one off?

06:12.084 --> 06:14.094
Late checkout!
Late checkout!

06:14.805 --> 06:17.960
Roger, Dad just cut me from...

06:18.775 --> 06:20.755
Is that...
Am I making that smell?

06:20.880 --> 06:22.530
I am. That smell is me.

06:22.689 --> 06:24.562
I'm making it, and I'm disgusting.

06:24.687 --> 06:26.826
He cut me from the team!

06:31.052 --> 06:32.112
Wait, what is this?

06:32.237 --> 06:34.977
He said I was a loser,
and he cut me.

06:35.477 --> 06:38.227
I'm leaking!
Terrific, I'm leaking something.

06:38.352 --> 06:41.138
This is going to be a great,
sploogey month with me leaking,

06:41.263 --> 06:43.610
and splooge coming out of me,
fantastic.

06:44.646 --> 06:47.148
Not this bit!
I'm Jack Tripper over here!

06:47.963 --> 06:50.071
Okay, all right, I'm up.
Now, what is this?

06:50.196 --> 06:51.894
What is your thing with the crying?

06:52.019 --> 06:54.319
Dad kicked me off the football team!

06:54.451 --> 06:56.123
All he cares about is winning.

06:56.449 --> 06:59.699
Can't tell you how many times
that man has made me cry.

07:10.696 --> 07:11.943
He never supports me!

07:12.068 --> 07:13.974
He's a bastard, is what he is.

07:14.143 --> 07:16.586
You know what?
Forget it. I'm over it.

07:16.807 --> 07:18.929
If he needs to win so badly,
let him.

07:19.054 --> 07:21.354
- I don't care.
- Steve, come here.

07:22.984 --> 07:23.738
This.

07:24.309 --> 07:25.801
This is what he did to you.

07:25.926 --> 07:27.915
And you're going to let him
get away with it?

07:28.040 --> 07:30.503
- What else is there to do?
- I'll tell you.

07:31.098 --> 07:32.845
Your dad made you cry, Steve.

07:32.970 --> 07:34.780
So we're going to make him cry.

07:34.905 --> 07:37.900
But, Roger, I've never seen my dad cry.
I don't think he can.

07:38.025 --> 07:41.020
When we get through with him,
he'll be bawling like a baby.

07:41.145 --> 07:43.165
Sobbing like a poor African woman

07:43.290 --> 07:45.668
who just lost all of her kids
to a scatter bomb.

07:46.250 --> 07:48.322
Powerful enough for you?
It's from my play.

07:48.447 --> 07:50.040
Haven't found the right producer.

07:50.165 --> 07:52.320
Point is,
we're going to make your dad cry!

07:57.688 --> 08:00.711
Here's a recipe
for black Muslim bean pie.

08:00.836 --> 08:02.931
I could make it "Allah mode."

08:03.195 --> 08:05.035
That means, "God be with ice cream".

08:05.160 --> 08:08.952
Mom, no self-respecting modern woman
should care this much about pies.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.337
Steve, here he comes!

08:11.462 --> 08:12.448
Take that, sir!

08:12.650 --> 08:15.410
Behold, a grown man
weeping like a...

08:18.140 --> 08:20.101
That?! That was your plan?

08:20.574 --> 08:22.322
- Are you crying?
- Yes, I'm crying.

08:22.447 --> 08:23.997
He hit me with chair!

08:24.444 --> 08:27.665
Okay, different plan.
We need to hit your dad where it hurts.

08:27.884 --> 08:29.635
And what does he love more than you?

08:29.760 --> 08:31.131
- Winning?
- That's right.

08:31.256 --> 08:33.772
So what if we formed
our own football team,

08:33.897 --> 08:35.972
and won the championship ourselves?

08:36.140 --> 08:38.142
I'm not a very good football player.

08:38.311 --> 08:40.552
You know why?
You never had a very good coach.

08:40.677 --> 08:43.842
You're looking at the man
who got robbed of a producer credit

08:43.967 --> 08:47.623
on the longest yard and was briefly
married to Bill Belichik's niece.

08:48.030 --> 08:50.862
Lets just say:
not very open sexually.

08:51.030 --> 08:53.220
You really think
we can make Dad lose?

08:54.300 --> 08:55.711
We're going to fill the bathtub

08:55.836 --> 08:58.402
in my dollhouse
with your father's tears.

08:59.825 --> 09:01.425
Sorry, Malibu Melinda.

09:01.920 --> 09:03.816
Look at her,
pooping with the door open.

09:03.941 --> 09:06.564
Disgusting.
She has let herself go.

09:06.689 --> 09:10.048
She hasn't washed her feet in months,
wears nothing but sweatpants.

09:10.341 --> 09:11.869
I can't take it anymore.

09:11.994 --> 09:15.732
See that tiny suitcase by the bed?
That's mine. I packed it months ago,

09:15.857 --> 09:18.129
but I can't bring myself
to walk out that door.

09:18.686 --> 09:22.436
Because I haven't had a chance
to go to the store yet, honey!

09:27.506 --> 09:28.898
Stan, did you hear that?

09:30.230 --> 09:31.814
I'm going to take your gun.

09:37.243 --> 09:38.638
My fairy-pie mother!

09:38.763 --> 09:40.213
You got my letters!

09:41.932 --> 09:44.186
Mom! It's not what you think!
I'm...

09:44.311 --> 09:46.624
- I'm cooking meth!
- Oh, really?

09:46.749 --> 09:48.849
Then where's your muriatic acid?

09:48.974 --> 09:50.368
You're making pies!

09:50.493 --> 09:52.443
Allow me to introduce myself.

09:52.827 --> 09:54.363
Carlotta Monterey.

09:55.735 --> 09:56.543
You?

09:56.858 --> 09:59.551
- You're my pie rival?
- Rival?

09:59.676 --> 10:02.288
You've given yourself
a generous compliment, madam.

10:02.413 --> 10:05.804
Listen up, Monterey!
It's pie time you got beaten!

10:06.093 --> 10:08.293
I've been saving that for the fair!

10:08.418 --> 10:10.943
But I'll think of another one crust
in time!

10:12.751 --> 10:14.821
Didn't see that coming, did you?

10:36.865 --> 10:38.512
Wonder whose car that was.

10:38.680 --> 10:41.829
- All right, who do we got?
- You know snot, Barry and Toshi.

10:41.954 --> 10:43.725
And these are
my equally important friends,

10:44.054 --> 10:45.878
Cheese, Hubert and Li Fung.

10:46.312 --> 10:50.107
- Plus the other kids who got cut.
- I am the amazing Rufus.

10:51.443 --> 10:53.891
Collapsible flowers on wires.
Slips right out of your sleeve.

10:54.016 --> 10:55.861
You want to be amazing?
Do it in a t-shirt.

10:56.031 --> 10:57.430
Okay, listen up, people!

10:57.555 --> 10:59.950
I'm going to turn you clowns
into a football team.

11:07.564 --> 11:10.984
Knock it off! I'm calling both of you
"karate chop" and that's the end of it.

11:11.109 --> 11:14.226
Now, in six weeks, we're going play
coach Smith and his Wolverines.

11:14.351 --> 11:16.966
Yeah, and we're going to get killed.
Great plan, Roger.

11:17.136 --> 11:18.721
Fine, so we don't have brawn.

11:18.846 --> 11:21.646
What really wins
football games is brains.

11:22.277 --> 11:24.959
I'm assuming you guys
are the smart kind of geeks?

11:25.084 --> 11:27.395
- 50-50.
- 50 plus 50 equals a hundred.

11:27.520 --> 11:30.276
And that's what we're going to do:
a hundred shots of beer.

11:30.401 --> 11:31.523
I got ten more to go.

11:31.741 --> 11:34.064
Then we're going to battle our way
to the championship, boys.

11:34.189 --> 11:36.484
And make the other team's coach cry!

11:46.809 --> 11:47.664
Hike!

12:08.953 --> 12:10.826
All right, our last opponent.

12:10.951 --> 12:12.801
The nexus six-series Replicants.

12:12.926 --> 12:14.673
They picked that name,
I was not involved.

12:14.798 --> 12:18.625
Doesn't matter. We're undefeated.
Your team had one successful snap.

12:18.750 --> 12:21.659
Those shorts make your package
look small and your ass look big.

12:22.228 --> 12:24.730
That makes two.
Two successful snaps.

12:25.856 --> 12:27.464
All right, fellas, huddle up.

12:28.024 --> 12:30.191
We're not going to win
the championship.

12:30.316 --> 12:32.103
- What?!
- Well, yeah.

12:32.228 --> 12:35.285
We haven't won a single game.
What'd you think was going to happen?

12:35.410 --> 12:36.472
Look, we stink.

12:36.597 --> 12:39.383
I would say it was my fault,
but it was you and your terrible bodies.

12:39.654 --> 12:42.213
I guess we're not going
to make my dad cry after all.

12:42.388 --> 12:43.261
Wrong!

12:43.386 --> 12:47.140
We may not be winners,
but we can be spoilers.

12:48.560 --> 12:51.565
History is filled with losers
who never won anything themselves,

12:51.690 --> 12:55.213
but who ruined the success of others:
Ralph Nader, Judas,

12:55.338 --> 12:58.560
that kid who pulled scissors on me
at the rock-paper-scissors tournament.

12:58.685 --> 13:01.737
Stabbed me in the parking lot. Ruined
my concentration for the whole tourney.

13:01.994 --> 13:05.050
Anyway, if we beat Smith's team,
it won't save our season.

13:05.175 --> 13:07.106
But it will spoil theirs!

13:07.465 --> 13:10.683
Now, what do you say?
Let's go out there and spoil!

13:18.070 --> 13:21.208
Sorry... We're not spoiling anything
today, and I got nothing else.

13:22.048 --> 13:24.761
That man cares more about winning
than he does about me.

13:24.929 --> 13:26.596
And I want him to taste defeat.

13:26.828 --> 13:28.866
Roger, I've got an idea.

13:29.362 --> 13:32.511
- Let's go under the bleachers.
- a make-out session won't help.

13:32.636 --> 13:34.271
But I guess that's what coaches do.

13:35.123 --> 13:37.274
Roger, are you still leaking
that splooge?

13:37.442 --> 13:39.978
Oh, God! With all the fluid
coming out of my armpits,

13:40.103 --> 13:42.393
I feel like Bette Davis
on her wedding night.

13:43.028 --> 13:44.550
You don't know enough about Bette.

13:44.675 --> 13:46.683
Take some of that stuff,
and rub it on me.

13:46.808 --> 13:47.858
What the...?

13:47.983 --> 13:49.786
Steve, that's brilliant!

13:54.255 --> 13:55.431
Four! Eight!

13:55.976 --> 13:57.776
Pi! Googleplex!

13:58.028 --> 14:00.254
Repeating remainder three! Hike!

14:35.417 --> 14:38.257
Roger, I need one last round
of slippery sauce.

14:39.033 --> 14:41.586
I think I'm dried up.
Speaking of my wife...

14:42.323 --> 14:44.517
- Steve, finish that one for me.
- There's no time!

14:44.642 --> 14:48.094
Come on, one more play and my dad
will know what it feels like to lose.

14:48.445 --> 14:50.756
Enough of this!
Take out that kid with glasses!

14:50.881 --> 14:53.767
- You mean your son?
- Yeah. Now, sweep the leg.

14:55.728 --> 14:58.103
- You got a problem with that?
- No, <i>sensei</i>.

14:58.557 --> 14:59.557
No mercy.

15:01.442 --> 15:03.674
I have been working
on this one thing.

15:03.926 --> 15:05.501
But we need a magician.

15:05.626 --> 15:07.405
Is there a magician on this team?

15:09.225 --> 15:09.993
Hike!

15:20.739 --> 15:22.082
- There he goes!
- Get him!

15:22.207 --> 15:23.207
Kill him!

15:27.760 --> 15:29.386
This kid, doesn't have the ball!

15:41.177 --> 15:42.527
Steve, we did it!

15:42.926 --> 15:44.962
Wha...? What happened?

15:46.230 --> 15:47.718
Look, there goes your dad!

15:51.349 --> 15:53.247
Is he crying?
Can you tell?

15:54.095 --> 15:56.913
Hey, Steve, before the game,
how many ears did you have?

15:59.959 --> 16:01.643
This is going to be great, Roger!

16:01.768 --> 16:03.702
I'm finally going to see my dad cry.

16:03.827 --> 16:06.298
Now, make sure we get
most of his tears in the tub.

16:09.207 --> 16:10.805
Oh, my god! Dad!

16:11.014 --> 16:12.751
Now, hang on, Steve.
He's still breathing.

16:12.876 --> 16:15.849
Stan, are you trying
to kill yourself or thrill yourself?

16:19.918 --> 16:21.117
Is he all right?

16:21.825 --> 16:23.162
He's going to be fine.

16:23.287 --> 16:25.703
I can't help feeling
this is all my fault.

16:25.931 --> 16:27.181
Can we see him?

16:30.111 --> 16:31.361
Franny, let me.

16:33.327 --> 16:34.727
I out-coached you.

16:34.911 --> 16:38.265
- Dad, why did you do this?
- Because I lost.

16:38.456 --> 16:40.635
Don't you think
that's a bit of an overreaction?

16:40.760 --> 16:42.542
So you lost.
Nobody cares.

16:42.711 --> 16:44.299
I care! I know I lost,

16:44.424 --> 16:47.380
and I couldn't bear to carry that shame
around for the rest of my life.

16:47.878 --> 16:49.053
Don't want to pile on,

16:49.178 --> 16:52.853
but you could've done a better job
with this whole suicide thing.

16:52.978 --> 16:54.528
I mean, you own guns.

16:59.052 --> 17:01.488
See, stan, I told you the fair
would cheer you up.

17:01.613 --> 17:03.661
You're right!
I'm going to enjoy myself.

17:03.786 --> 17:06.843
I hear there's a tent with a bunch
of frogs that croak <i>Hotel California</i>.

17:06.968 --> 17:09.028
Oh, my God!
That's judge Judy!

17:09.487 --> 17:10.498
No, it's not.

17:10.623 --> 17:13.770
You think judge Judy is coming
to the Langley county fair?

17:13.895 --> 17:15.759
That's why I was surprised.

17:16.090 --> 17:19.864
- Well, I'm going to go enter my pie.
- Like I did last night, huh?

17:21.088 --> 17:24.314
It's good to hear you making jokes
about nailing mom, dad.

17:24.439 --> 17:26.499
I'm just enjoying my last day
on earth.

17:26.624 --> 17:28.434
- What?!
- I'm still gonna kill myself.

17:28.559 --> 17:30.340
I'm a loser.
There's no other answer.

17:30.625 --> 17:32.055
What? No, dad!

17:32.307 --> 17:35.297
You can't do that.
So you lost. Who cares?

17:35.422 --> 17:37.756
I lose all the time
and I'm not suicidal.

17:37.881 --> 17:39.602
I just cry and get over it.

17:39.805 --> 17:42.555
That's what life is, Dad:
losing and crying.

17:42.909 --> 17:45.904
You lose one time and you go straight
to hanging yourself.

17:46.029 --> 17:47.991
Wait, that's it!
Come with me!

17:50.801 --> 17:52.001
Go ahead, Dad.

17:54.773 --> 17:55.699
Good-bye, son.

17:56.045 --> 17:59.035
One piece of advice before I go:
don't marry an actress.

17:59.203 --> 18:01.903
Wait, dad!
What do you feel in this moment?

18:03.252 --> 18:06.152
Shame, soul-shattering emptiness,
embarrassment.

18:06.639 --> 18:08.417
I'm gonna turn the whole thing off.

18:08.669 --> 18:11.548
No! Instead, go with those feelings.

18:11.843 --> 18:13.633
You know, let them out!

18:13.801 --> 18:16.759
- Of my neck?
- No, out of your eyes.

18:16.982 --> 18:19.845
Look, all this time I wanted
to make you cry to hurt you,

18:19.970 --> 18:21.891
but it's actually going to help you!

18:22.286 --> 18:23.473
- It will?
- Yes!

18:23.598 --> 18:25.032
Now, come on, you can do it.

18:25.157 --> 18:27.475
Think about something
that makes you really sad.

18:27.600 --> 18:28.566
Think about...

18:28.691 --> 18:32.208
A bear cub abandoned
because someone killed its mother.

18:32.333 --> 18:34.792
You know what's sad about that?
No one killed the cub.

18:34.917 --> 18:37.795
Cubs make good eatin'.
Sliced thin on a ritz.

18:41.005 --> 18:42.816
Excellent choice, Francine.

18:43.125 --> 18:45.997
Peach Bavarian cream
is mayor Woodside's favorite pie.

18:46.208 --> 18:48.244
Is he judging this year?

18:48.369 --> 18:51.102
I had no idea, councilwoman Santos.

18:51.227 --> 18:54.078
Well, I think he'll have
a new favorite this year.

18:54.737 --> 18:57.510
- Is that...?
- Carlotta Monterey, nice to meet you.

18:57.678 --> 18:59.846
I thought I'd pick up
my prize personally this year.

19:01.848 --> 19:03.248
You're Carlotta...

19:03.469 --> 19:06.311
- Wait, I already knew that.
- Ladies.

19:06.480 --> 19:07.800
I'm pleased to announce

19:07.925 --> 19:11.318
the winner of this year's
county fair pie contest.

19:11.707 --> 19:13.759
The blue ribbon goes to...

19:16.760 --> 19:18.160
Emmilou Sugarbean!

19:19.131 --> 19:19.931
Who?

19:20.379 --> 19:22.094
Oh, my stars!

19:24.747 --> 19:27.242
I've been secretly competing
with both of you for years.

19:27.367 --> 19:28.928
What put me over the top this time?

19:29.053 --> 19:30.801
I put fruit and sugar in my pie,

19:30.926 --> 19:33.167
instead of soggy napkins
and gerbil meat.

19:33.292 --> 19:36.659
I also made a sizable contribution
to mayor Woodside's mouth.

19:37.128 --> 19:39.229
How about the end
of <i>Terms of endearment</i> ?

19:39.354 --> 19:43.019
When Shirley MacLaine is standing over
Debra Winger's hospital bed

19:43.144 --> 19:44.849
as she's dying from cancer.

19:45.220 --> 19:48.877
And as her only child passes away
before her very eyes,

19:49.002 --> 19:50.807
she sits there, dumbstruck.

19:51.705 --> 19:54.406
She thought that death
would somehow feel like a relief,

19:54.531 --> 19:56.434
but instead she just sobs...

19:56.559 --> 19:58.154
Overwhelmed by a pain

19:58.279 --> 20:00.740
that only a mother
who outlives her child can feel.

20:01.876 --> 20:04.633
- That was a funny movie!
- Okay, close your eyes.

20:05.632 --> 20:07.218
I want you to picture a boy.

20:07.343 --> 20:08.998
- Is he white?
- Yes, he's white.

20:09.248 --> 20:10.488
He's also not popular.

20:10.613 --> 20:13.234
And he gets shot down
by every girl that he asks out.

20:13.359 --> 20:15.713
But he keeps his chin up
through all of it.

20:16.042 --> 20:17.476
And then he takes a chance.

20:17.601 --> 20:19.966
He takes a chance
by joining the football team

20:20.091 --> 20:23.840
'cause the only thing he really wants
to win is his father's affection.

20:24.964 --> 20:27.646
And then, his father cuts him
from the team.

20:27.853 --> 20:31.181
- Yeah, Steve, I really gotta...
- Now, picture that white boy

20:31.306 --> 20:32.912
- is you.
- What?!

20:33.638 --> 20:35.573
My daddy cut me from the team?

20:35.777 --> 20:38.127
But, Daddy, I...
I tried my hardest.

20:38.693 --> 20:40.346
Why won't you love me?

20:41.189 --> 20:43.041
Why, Daddy?
Why?

20:50.201 --> 20:52.013
Oh, God, this feels so good.

20:53.845 --> 20:56.317
That's right, Dad, let it out.

20:58.235 --> 21:00.973
What a wonderful alternative
to suicide!

21:01.346 --> 21:02.346
Told ya.

21:03.966 --> 21:05.216
Thank you, son.

21:05.711 --> 21:06.711
Thank you.

21:07.832 --> 21:10.128
Look at this.
We're having a father-son moment.

21:11.160 --> 21:12.478
Quit ruining it!
