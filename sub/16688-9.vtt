00:10.040 --> 00:12.540
Pam: Listen, Benson,
we need to talk.

00:12.640 --> 00:13.940
We are talking!

00:14.040 --> 00:16.040
Ooh! Want to hear
how many pushâups

00:15.360 --> 00:17.360
I did at training today?

00:16.440 --> 00:18.140
No, we need
to really talk.

00:18.240 --> 00:19.660
Oh. Okay.

00:19.760 --> 00:22.700
This...this isn't
working for me anymore.

00:22.800 --> 00:24.100
Mmâhmm. Mmâhmm.

00:24.200 --> 00:26.540
Benson, you're a great guy,
but, I have no idea

00:26.640 --> 00:29.260
when you're coming back,
or ââ or <i>ifyou're coming back.</i>

00:29.360 --> 00:30.500
Sure, sure.

00:30.600 --> 00:32.600
You know, statistically,
the further away

00:32.360 --> 00:34.280
two mates are from each other,
the less likely it is

00:34.360 --> 00:36.360
that their relationship
will last.

00:35.920 --> 00:37.920
( Voice breaking )
I've done the calculations,

00:37.480 --> 00:41.220
and our odds are only 1.35%.

00:41.320 --> 00:42.180
Mmâhmm.

00:42.280 --> 00:45.540
I'm ââ I'm sorry, Benson.

00:45.640 --> 00:48.060
It's not you,
it's just math.

00:48.160 --> 00:50.620
I think we should
just be friends.

00:50.720 --> 00:53.460
I get it. I was sent
millions of miles into space

00:53.560 --> 00:56.180
against my will,
you're back on Earth.

00:56.280 --> 00:57.980
Are you sure you're okay?

00:58.080 --> 00:59.540
I totally understand.

00:59.640 --> 01:01.860
I am goâoâod.

01:01.960 --> 01:05.780
( Sobbing )

01:05.880 --> 01:07.860
Paâaâaâm!

01:07.960 --> 01:09.860
Why?!

01:09.960 --> 01:10.820
( Thud! )

01:10.920 --> 01:13.540
Noâoâoâo.

01:13.640 --> 01:15.380
( Whimpers )

01:15.480 --> 01:17.480
Okay, okay, okay.
My turn.

01:16.520 --> 01:17.780
Hmm? Hmmâhmm?

01:17.880 --> 01:21.260
Would you rather
have spaghetti for fingers

01:21.360 --> 01:24.460
or have spiders
crawl out of your mouth

01:24.560 --> 01:25.980
every time you yawn?

01:26.080 --> 01:27.340
Hmm.
That's a good one.

01:27.440 --> 01:30.060
If I eat my spaghetti fingers,
do they grow back?

01:30.160 --> 01:32.540
Yeah, but they're
whole wheat pasta.

01:32.640 --> 01:33.900
Aw! Sick dude!

01:34.000 --> 01:35.540
Well in that case,
I got to go with...

01:35.640 --> 01:36.700
Uh...

01:36.800 --> 01:40.040
( Somber piano music plays )
( Slurping )

01:39.360 --> 01:40.820
Mm...
Uhâoh.

01:40.920 --> 01:42.740
Um, hey, buddy.

01:42.840 --> 01:45.420
Everything okay, man?

01:45.520 --> 01:48.820
No. Pam dumped me.

01:48.920 --> 01:50.980
I've been eating
all these wings,

01:51.080 --> 01:53.540
but they're not
making me feel any better.

01:53.640 --> 01:57.500
Hey, wait, didn't you and Pam
eat wings on your first date?

01:57.600 --> 02:00.860
Oh, no!

02:00.960 --> 02:03.580
That's why
they're not working!

02:03.680 --> 02:06.180
They're just making me
think about Pam!

02:06.280 --> 02:08.460
Whoa, whoa!
Forget about wings!

02:08.560 --> 02:10.580
Yeah, these space wings
are whack anyways.

02:10.680 --> 02:12.460
We know what'll
make you feel better.

02:12.560 --> 02:13.460
What?

02:13.560 --> 02:15.380
Um...
Um...

02:15.480 --> 02:17.780
Frrrri...
Frrrrii...

02:17.880 --> 02:18.740
Together: Fries!

02:18.840 --> 02:19.660
Fries?

02:19.760 --> 02:20.900
Crispy, delicious fries.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.060
I'm talking curly!

02:22.160 --> 02:23.580
Crissâcut!
Wedgeâcut.

02:23.680 --> 02:25.260
Crinkleâcut!!
Shoeâstring!

02:25.360 --> 02:27.140
Artisanal salt, yo!

02:27.240 --> 02:30.700
Yeah! Fries will fill
the void in my soul!

02:30.800 --> 02:33.340
Whew! We really dodged
a bullet on that one.

02:33.440 --> 02:36.320
Where can I find fries?

02:37.480 --> 02:38.660
( Gasps )

02:38.760 --> 02:40.760
( Panting )

02:42.240 --> 02:44.660
Wedgeâcut, crissâcut,
crinkleâcut, wedgeâcut,

02:44.760 --> 02:46.580
crissâcut, crinkleâcut,
shoeâstrings.

02:46.680 --> 02:48.180
( Laughs )

02:48.280 --> 02:50.280
I think I'm starting
to feel better alreadââ

02:49.720 --> 02:51.140
( Smash! )

02:51.240 --> 02:53.460
Oh, my gosh!
It was a hit and run!

02:53.560 --> 02:55.540
That ice cream truck guy
just took off!

02:55.640 --> 02:56.580
Are you okay?

02:56.680 --> 02:58.940
Huh? Where am I?
Who are you?

02:59.040 --> 03:01.100
I'm Roxy,
and you're in my fry truck.

03:01.200 --> 03:02.980
Great! I'm Benson.

03:03.080 --> 03:04.580
Can I get
an order of fries?

03:04.680 --> 03:06.860
I'm sorry, but we sold out
in, like, 10 minutes.

03:06.960 --> 03:09.500
Got to kick you out.
I'm about to go on a supply run.

03:09.600 --> 03:10.940
Ugh, typical.

03:11.040 --> 03:13.500
The saddest day of my life,
then I get hit by a truck,

03:13.600 --> 03:15.140
and now
I can't even get fries.

03:15.240 --> 03:17.980
Why did I think fries
could make me happy again?

03:18.080 --> 03:19.300
This was dumb.

03:19.400 --> 03:21.020
Sorry to bother you, Roxy.

03:21.120 --> 03:23.860
Or if you want to tag along
with me on my supply run,

03:23.960 --> 03:25.960
I can make you
a fresh batch when I'm done.

03:25.440 --> 03:27.140
Really?
You'd do that for me?

03:27.240 --> 03:30.420
My fries are the best
in the galaxy, Benson.

03:30.520 --> 03:32.940
We're gonna turn
that frown upside down.

03:33.040 --> 03:34.900
Wait, are you smiling?

03:35.000 --> 03:36.820
Yep. "Roxy's Fries ââ

03:36.920 --> 03:39.340
Guaranteed to put
a smile on your face!"

03:39.440 --> 03:41.100
All right.

03:41.200 --> 03:43.640
So, we're just going for a quick
grocery store run or something?

03:43.720 --> 03:46.140
( Laughs )
Not if you want the good stuff.

03:52.920 --> 03:54.980
This is
the potato planet mine.

03:55.080 --> 03:56.500
For the good stuff,

03:56.600 --> 03:58.940
we got it go way down there
to the bottom.

03:59.040 --> 04:01.540
You sure we can't just
go to the grocery store?

04:01.640 --> 04:04.460
Hey, there's a reason my fries
are the best in the galaxy.

04:04.560 --> 04:05.420
Come on!

04:05.520 --> 04:08.200
Ow! That kind of hurt.

04:09.480 --> 04:10.460
So, what do we do now?

04:10.560 --> 04:11.940
Now we dig.

04:12.040 --> 04:13.620
You're the boss.

04:13.720 --> 04:16.060
( Upâtempo music plays )

04:16.160 --> 04:18.140
Whew! This is
actually kind of fun!

04:18.240 --> 04:21.020
I think I see
a smile coming on.

04:21.120 --> 04:23.700
Oh, no! Potato bugs!

04:23.800 --> 04:26.380

I just

04:39.840 --> 04:40.940
want

some fries!

04:42.960 --> 04:44.020

04:44.120 --> 04:46.220
I'm trying to
get through a rough day,

04:46.320 --> 04:48.180
and I don't have time
for this right now!

( Screams )

04:49.320 --> 04:51.380

04:51.480 --> 04:52.500
Aah!

04:52.600 --> 04:54.940
( Grunts )
Roxy! Are you okay?

04:55.040 --> 04:56.980
I...I think so.

04:57.080 --> 04:59.180
Good. We better
get out of here.

04:59.280 --> 05:00.940
I can't believe
you did that.

05:01.040 --> 05:02.860
Okay, we got potato.
What's next?

05:02.960 --> 05:04.020
Um, right!

05:04.120 --> 05:05.620
Uh, we need oil.

05:10.760 --> 05:12.700
Okay.
Barrel's in place.

05:12.800 --> 05:14.980
Great. I'll open the valve.

05:15.080 --> 05:16.380
Oh, here. I'll get that.

05:16.480 --> 05:18.820
Thanks!
I guess chivalry isn't dead.

05:18.920 --> 05:22.420
So, if you want to talk about
your bad day, you can.

05:22.520 --> 05:24.180
I can offer
a shoulder to cry on.

05:24.280 --> 05:26.100
I mean ââ Well,
not literally, but ââ

05:26.200 --> 05:27.700
Uh, thanks.

05:27.800 --> 05:30.060
I guess it's just hard
being single and in space.

05:30.160 --> 05:32.380
I'm single
and in space, too!

05:32.480 --> 05:34.700
So, um, do you
have any hobbies?

05:34.800 --> 05:37.580
Well, I used to be
a drummer in a rock band.

if he's into me.

one of the best.

08:26.400 --> 08:27.380
Please stop!

08:27.480 --> 08:28.340
( Wind howling )

08:28.440 --> 08:30.740
Roxy!

08:30.840 --> 08:32.020
( Sobs )

08:32.120 --> 08:33.500
Roxy!

08:35.800 --> 08:37.880
( Engine starts, tires screech )

08:41.880 --> 08:43.880
Roxy!

08:48.160 --> 08:50.060
( Tires screech )

08:50.160 --> 08:51.260
Aaah!

08:51.360 --> 08:52.300
It's all right.

08:52.400 --> 08:56.680
That's what insurance is for.
Come on, Roxy. Where are you?

08:58.120 --> 08:58.980
Roxy!

08:59.080 --> 09:01.080
( Horn honks )

09:02.120 --> 09:04.320
Roxy, wait!

09:05.280 --> 09:06.500
( Grunting )

09:06.600 --> 09:07.460
( Thud! )

09:07.560 --> 09:09.540
Whoâoâoâoâaâaâaâa!

09:09.640 --> 09:10.540
( Cracking )

09:10.640 --> 09:12.500
Aaah!

09:12.600 --> 09:15.020
( Screams )

09:15.120 --> 09:17.120
Benson!

09:21.920 --> 09:24.700
As long as we keep it under
lightâspeed, that should hold.

09:24.800 --> 09:27.300
Look, Roxy, about earlier,
I'm really sorry.

09:27.400 --> 09:28.860
It's okay. I get it.

09:28.960 --> 09:31.380
No, I just want you
to know it's not about you.

09:31.480 --> 09:32.700
You're a really cool girl,

09:32.800 --> 09:34.540
and, honestly,
I think you're great but...

09:34.640 --> 09:35.940
( Sighs )

09:36.040 --> 09:38.180
See, the whole reason
I wanted fries

09:38.280 --> 09:40.380
was to try to
feel better because ââ

09:40.480 --> 09:42.820
because my girlfriend
dumped me this morning.

09:42.920 --> 09:44.220
Oh, Benson.

09:44.320 --> 09:46.540
It's not the first time
I've been dumped...

09:46.640 --> 09:49.340
or the second...
or the third.

09:49.440 --> 09:50.780
It's happened a lot.

09:50.880 --> 09:54.180
I mean, Dumptown is a place,
and I've been there Roxy.

09:54.280 --> 09:58.340
It still hurts and, well,
I'm kind of a mess right now.

09:58.440 --> 09:59.860
I hope you understand.

09:59.960 --> 10:01.940
Yeah.

10:02.040 --> 10:03.860
Hey, you know
what we need?

10:03.960 --> 10:05.300
French fries.

10:10.920 --> 10:12.540
Oh, we forgot
the salt.

10:12.640 --> 10:14.300
No, we didn't.

10:14.400 --> 10:17.560
My secret ingredient ââ
butt salt.

10:19.600 --> 10:21.940
Oh, wow.
Those are great fries!

10:22.040 --> 10:23.180
Feel better?

10:23.280 --> 10:24.860
I do.
Me too.

10:24.960 --> 10:27.220
Mmm.
This is so good!

10:27.320 --> 10:30.100
Oh, here comes
the best part!

10:30.200 --> 10:32.580
Hey, Roxy, are you smiling?

10:32.680 --> 10:34.680
I sure am.
