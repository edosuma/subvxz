Your eyelids are growing heavy.

00:07.541 --> 00:10.009
You are getting sleepy.

00:10.711 --> 00:13.812
You are no longer a cat.

00:13.814 --> 00:15.414
You are a bagel.

00:15.416 --> 00:17.950
- What are you doing?
- Hey! You scared me.

00:17.952 --> 00:19.385
You ought to wear a bell.

00:19.387 --> 00:21.620
W-what's going on here?

00:21.622 --> 00:25.557
Um, I was, uh, I was just
teaching Lucky how to tell time.

00:25.559 --> 00:27.393
Show Willie what you've learned.

00:27.395 --> 00:28.861
You were hypnotizing him,
weren't you?

00:28.863 --> 00:29.895

00:29.897 --> 00:31.730
Okay, you caught us.

00:31.732 --> 00:34.733
I'm trying to help Lucky
beat his smoking problem.

00:34.735 --> 00:36.602
Alright, it looks like
it's once again time

00:36.604 --> 00:39.338

of the household.

00:39.340 --> 00:40.773
Rule number one

00:40.775 --> 00:43.575

members of the family.

00:43.577 --> 00:45.778
Willie, Willie, Willie.

00:45.780 --> 00:48.580

Uh, look, uh

00:49.884 --> 00:51.316

Kate and the kids.

Now, while I'm gone,
I'd like you to refrain

00:54.388 --> 00:56.288
from kidding Lucky.

00:56.290 --> 00:57.222
No problem.

00:57.224 --> 00:59.391
I'd also like you
to refrain

00:59.393 --> 01:02.461

family heirlooms.

It's broken.

01:06.801 --> 01:08.400
Lucky fell on it.

01:08.402 --> 01:11.837
You know, it's not always true
that they land on their feet.

01:13.207 --> 01:14.339
Lucky?

01:15.843 --> 01:17.276
Lucky, don't listen to him.

01:17.278 --> 01:20.045
Don't listen to him.
You're not a bagel.

03:55.836 --> 03:57.202
Well, I had the music
pretty loud.

03:57.204 --> 03:59.271
I probably wouldn't
have heard the phone.

04:04.678 --> 04:07.212
Uh, uh, I was planning
to have the place spotless

04:07.214 --> 04:09.047
by the time you got back.

04:09.650 --> 04:10.983
[thuds]

04:10.985 --> 04:12.618
When did you expect us back?

04:12.620 --> 04:14.953
In April?

04:14.955 --> 04:17.656
When I left, you said
you were going to behave

04:17.658 --> 04:21.226
but this is not behaving,
this is mass destruction.

04:21.228 --> 04:23.262
I don't know what happened.

04:23.264 --> 04:26.565
I was sitting here,
doing better than my best.

04:26.567 --> 04:29.334
I decided I'd make myself
a little snack..

04:30.571 --> 04:32.271
...the rest is a blur.

04:33.173 --> 04:34.840
How can one alien

04:34.842 --> 04:36.508
be so irresponsible?

04:36.510 --> 04:40.078
I wasn't irresponsible.
I was hungry!

04:41.515 --> 04:43.782
Did you eat
everything in the house?

04:43.784 --> 04:45.117
No.

04:45.119 --> 04:47.085
I don't think so.

04:49.790 --> 04:52.024
Oh, wait a minute,
here's something.

04:52.760 --> 04:54.259
Who wants a cookie?

04:54.261 --> 04:55.260
I do.

04:56.163 --> 04:58.030
I'll split it with you.

04:59.199 --> 05:01.366
Brian, why don't you
go feed Lucky?

05:01.368 --> 05:03.268
I hope there's some food left.

05:03.270 --> 05:05.637
You didn't eat
all the cat food too, did you?

05:05.639 --> 05:09.541
No way. I draw the line
at intestinal byproducts.

05:10.544 --> 05:12.444
How can you eat so much?

05:12.446 --> 05:15.280
I've been blessed
with multiple stomachs.

05:16.583 --> 05:19.051
I don't understand
why you don't gain any weight.

05:19.053 --> 05:21.453
It's all in the way
you combine your foods.

05:21.455 --> 05:23.555
- Really? That's interesting.
- Yeah.

05:23.557 --> 05:26.458
Merv did a show on it.
I have a tape here somewhere.

05:27.628 --> 05:28.927
I don't believe this.

05:28.929 --> 05:30.429
Merv says it works.

05:30.431 --> 05:33.498
Of course,
have you seen Merv lately?

05:35.969 --> 05:37.369
Alright, forget Merv.

05:37.371 --> 05:39.104
We're not talking about Merv.

05:39.106 --> 05:40.906
No more Merv!

05:40.908 --> 05:43.108
Fine, he's off the air anyway.

05:44.445 --> 05:47.579
Let's talk a little
about how much food costs.

05:47.581 --> 05:48.480
Yeah, hey, Kate!

05:48.482 --> 05:49.915
You know, you could
save a fortune

05:49.917 --> 05:51.416
by clipping coupons.

05:51.418 --> 05:53.752
They did a whole show
about it on Mer..

05:53.754 --> 05:55.520
The fat guy's show.

05:57.191 --> 06:00.392
Coupon clipping
is not a good idea.

06:00.394 --> 06:03.595
I shouldn't be allowed
to hold scissors.

06:04.965 --> 06:06.398
Am I being overly sensitive

06:06.400 --> 06:08.633
or is there tension
in this room?

06:10.104 --> 06:12.771
ALF, let's get
this place cleaned up.

06:12.773 --> 06:14.172
I'll give you a hand.

06:14.174 --> 06:15.607
Can we hold off
on that a second?

06:15.609 --> 06:16.942
I feel a burp coming on.

06:16.944 --> 06:18.477
Oh, goody.

06:19.446 --> 06:21.179
Uh, while we're waiting..

06:21.181 --> 06:22.981
...would you take off my shirt?

06:22.983 --> 06:24.182
Sure.

06:24.184 --> 06:25.717
It's.. No, not..

06:25.719 --> 06:26.885
The one you're wearing.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.086
Right.

06:28.789 --> 06:29.955
I can't find Lucky.

06:29.957 --> 06:32.557
Oh, he's around somewhere.

06:32.559 --> 06:34.126
I looked all over.

06:34.128 --> 06:35.594
I wonder where Lucky is.

06:35.596 --> 06:36.828
Do you know, ALF?

06:36.830 --> 06:37.996
Hold it.

06:37.998 --> 06:39.531
[burps]

06:39.533 --> 06:40.799
No.

06:40.801 --> 06:42.334
I'll look around some more.

06:42.336 --> 06:44.102
Brian, see if Lucky's
in the hamper!

06:44.104 --> 06:46.972
He likes rolling around
in dirty laundry!

06:46.974 --> 06:48.407
Who doesn't?

06:49.543 --> 06:50.776
ALF..

06:50.778 --> 06:52.244
...do you know where Lucky is?

06:52.246 --> 06:55.614
You know Lucky,
he's a free spirit.

06:55.616 --> 06:56.748
Last time I saw him

06:56.750 --> 06:59.251
he was hightailing it
out of the window.

06:59.253 --> 07:00.352
And what were you doing?

07:00.354 --> 07:03.288
I was chasing him with a fork!

07:03.290 --> 07:07.225
[laughing]
Just kidding.

07:07.227 --> 07:10.762
On Melmac,
a cat-fork joke is a classic.

07:10.764 --> 07:13.331
It's-it's right up there
with, with Seltzer bottles

07:13.333 --> 07:15.467
and whoopee cushions.

07:15.469 --> 07:17.536
No wonder vaudeville is dead.

07:19.173 --> 07:22.107
ALF, the last time I saw Lucky

07:22.109 --> 07:26.311
you were teaching him
to tell time.

07:26.313 --> 07:28.213
- What are you getting at?
- Yeah.

07:28.215 --> 07:31.450
What does tell time mean?

07:31.452 --> 07:34.953
It means hypnotizing the cat
into thinking he's a bagel.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.721
Oh.

07:36.723 --> 07:40.525
Oh, you mean, you think ALF
might have, might have eaten..

07:40.527 --> 07:41.660
ALF, you didn't!

07:42.830 --> 07:44.863
Hey, hey, hey.

07:44.865 --> 07:48.800
We're treading on some
pretty serious ground here.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.969
These unjust accusations have

07:50.971 --> 07:53.338
litigation written
all over them.

07:53.340 --> 07:54.439
I know my rights.

07:54.441 --> 07:56.408
I watch "People's Court."

07:56.410 --> 07:59.978
ALF, did you eat Lucky or not?

07:59.980 --> 08:01.513
Willie, I know the rules.

08:01.515 --> 08:05.183
We don't eat
members of our family.

08:05.185 --> 08:08.053
We don't eat
members of<i> any</i> family.

08:08.055 --> 08:09.921
Well, which is it?

08:12.259 --> 08:14.426
I can't find Lucky anywhere.

08:14.428 --> 08:18.163
Well, maybe he got sucked
into a parallel dimension.

08:18.165 --> 08:20.365
I've seen that happen before.

08:21.335 --> 08:23.535
I, I don't think so.

08:23.537 --> 08:27.138
Oh, so I guess there's only
one other explanation.

08:27.140 --> 08:29.808
The alien must have eaten him.

08:29.810 --> 08:31.243
Well, I didn't!

08:31.245 --> 08:33.545
Smell my breath.
There's no Lucky on it.

That's the only thing
that's not on it.

08:38.218 --> 08:40.619
ALF wouldn't eat Lucky.

08:40.621 --> 08:41.820
Would you?

08:41.822 --> 08:45.490
I'm not saying anything
until I talk to my attorney.

08:45.492 --> 08:47.792
Now, look, maybe we're
rushing into judgment here.

08:47.794 --> 08:49.895
Uh, maybe Lucky just

08:49.897 --> 08:51.496
went for a walk.

08:51.498 --> 08:53.732
I-I-I'm sure he'll turn up.

- Don't look.

09:02.409 --> 09:04.709
Hey, this isn't Lucky.

09:04.711 --> 09:07.078
I was licking
some Jell-O off my arms

09:07.080 --> 09:10.315
and I, and I swallowed hair.

09:10.317 --> 09:13.618
Come on, guys,
it's me you're talking to.

Hey, what's with this family?

09:34.675 --> 09:39.010
Not when the accused
coughs up the victim!

09:39.012 --> 09:42.647
Is there anyone here
who doesn't think I'm guilty?

09:43.850 --> 09:45.183
Well..

09:45.185 --> 09:46.484
Thanks, Lynn.

09:46.486 --> 09:48.620
...maybe you ate him
by accident.

09:49.056 --> 09:50.822
I see.

Well, the indictment

12:50.103 --> 12:51.469
I'm just so hungry.

12:51.471 --> 12:53.772
- Me too.
- Me too.

12:53.774 --> 12:56.040
We better eat fast
before ALF gets to it.

12:56.042 --> 12:58.476
Okay, I'll have
a bowl of Sugar Shocks.

12:58.478 --> 13:00.712
Sugar Shocks
aren't good for you.

13:00.714 --> 13:03.281
How about if I pour some
nice healthy milk on them?

13:03.283 --> 13:05.850
How about if I pour some milk
on your oatmeal?

13:05.852 --> 13:07.218
Chocolate milk?

13:07.220 --> 13:08.486
It's a deal.

13:08.488 --> 13:10.021
Where's ALF this morning?

13:10.023 --> 13:12.457
Probably too ashamed
to come to breakfast.

13:12.459 --> 13:14.092
Or too full.

13:14.094 --> 13:16.494
I had a dream last night
that ALF came into my room

13:16.496 --> 13:18.263
and tried to eat me.

13:18.265 --> 13:20.698
Brian, ALF would never do that.

13:20.700 --> 13:22.467
Of course, he wouldn't.

13:23.370 --> 13:25.136
You sleep with us tonight.

13:27.207 --> 13:30.008
[sighs]
You know, I almost
feel sorry for ALF.

13:30.010 --> 13:31.276
Why?

13:31.278 --> 13:32.544
I'm just trying to see things

13:32.546 --> 13:33.912
through his eyes.

13:33.914 --> 13:36.714
I'm trying to understand
why he ate Lucky.

13:36.716 --> 13:38.750
I mean, ALF has
different instincts than we do.

13:38.752 --> 13:42.253
On his planet they eat cats
the same way we eat cows.

13:42.255 --> 13:43.922
We don't eat cows.

13:43.924 --> 13:46.224
Where do you think
hamburgers come from?

13:46.226 --> 13:47.759
The supermarket.

13:48.495 --> 13:49.727
I have good news.

13:49.729 --> 13:51.462
Brian, go get ALF.

13:51.464 --> 13:52.597
I want you to look at something.

13:52.599 --> 13:53.631
(Kate)
'What?'

13:53.633 --> 13:54.766
I've analyzed the composition

13:54.768 --> 13:56.434
of the fur ball
and I've compared it

13:56.436 --> 13:58.469
to the clump of hair..

13:58.471 --> 13:59.838
...uh, a clump
of ALF's hair

13:59.840 --> 14:01.072
that I found
in the ice cream.

14:01.074 --> 14:03.041
Now, the composition
of the fur ball

14:03.043 --> 14:06.277
is the same as the hair
in the ice cream.

14:06.279 --> 14:07.612
Do you know what that means?

14:07.614 --> 14:09.681
It means breakfast is over.

14:09.683 --> 14:12.784
No, it means ALF is innocent.

14:12.786 --> 14:15.486
So we were wrong?
We accused him unjustly?

14:15.488 --> 14:17.789
- We should have believed him.
- Oh.

14:19.392 --> 14:20.658
- Where's ALF?
- I don't know.

14:20.660 --> 14:23.361
- But I found this note.
- What does it say?

14:23.363 --> 14:24.629
Oh, hmm..

14:24.631 --> 14:26.130
[indistinct mumbling]

14:26.132 --> 14:28.366
Let's, uh, skip the part
about David Janssen.

14:28.368 --> 14:31.269
It says...he didn't eat Lucky.

14:31.271 --> 14:32.737
Poor ALF.

14:32.739 --> 14:35.240
It says he's gone out
to find Lucky

14:35.242 --> 14:37.041
and to prove his innocence.

14:37.043 --> 14:38.910
And his manhood.

14:39.813 --> 14:42.013
This letter even has teardrops.

14:42.716 --> 14:44.916
Grape-colored teardrops.

14:49.522 --> 14:52.156
- He must feel so betrayed.
- Hmm.

14:52.158 --> 14:53.858
I'm gonna go find him.

14:56.162 --> 14:57.695
I'm going too.

14:58.865 --> 15:00.732
I'm coming with you.

15:01.268 --> 15:02.901
Me too.

15:02.903 --> 15:05.870
ALF is all alone out there,
I'm really worried about him.

15:05.872 --> 15:08.172
And he doesn't know
about crossing on the green

15:08.174 --> 15:09.040
and not in between.

15:09.042 --> 15:10.608
(Willie)
That's right.

15:10.610 --> 15:11.943
- Where are we gonna look?
- I don't know.

15:11.945 --> 15:14.913
- He could be anywhere.
- Yeah.

15:14.915 --> 15:16.514
You know, we really
should have watched

15:16.516 --> 15:18.816
more episodes
of "The Fugitive."

15:20.754 --> 15:23.955

16:23.917 --> 16:27.652
So, uh...what are you guys
in for?

16:29.389 --> 16:31.322
Okay, be that way.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.158
Just tell me one thing.

16:34.160 --> 16:36.661
That, uh,
that sign over there..

16:36.663 --> 16:39.297
Does neutered mean
what I think it does?

16:39.299 --> 16:41.199
[dogs barking]

16:41.201 --> 16:42.800
I guess it does.

16:43.837 --> 16:45.770
Look, uh,
anybody have a coat hanger?

16:45.772 --> 16:48.373
I'll show you
how to get out of this dump.

16:48.375 --> 16:50.975
- 'Here you go, boy.'
- Ixnay on the angerhay.

16:50.977 --> 16:52.944
I think the screw's coming.

16:56.616 --> 16:58.983
Oh, my gosh, he's got a horse.

16:59.919 --> 17:02.453
Okay, who wants a roommate, huh?

17:02.455 --> 17:03.588
Mm-mm-mm.

17:03.590 --> 17:04.655
[gulps]

17:04.657 --> 17:06.691
There's an empty one.

17:06.693 --> 17:08.593
- There you go.
- Oh.

17:08.595 --> 17:09.827
Whew!

17:12.599 --> 17:13.965
[dogs barking]

17:13.967 --> 17:16.401
What are you doing
without your jockey?

17:17.404 --> 17:19.871
Just kidding, just kidding.

17:19.873 --> 17:22.607
Gee. This whole
planet's uptight.

17:22.609 --> 17:25.276
Come on, guys.
Let's loosen up.

17:25.278 --> 17:28.246
¶ On Wisconsin
On Wisconsin ¶

17:28.248 --> 17:30.748
Jump in when you're ready.
Let's go. Come on.

¶ On Wisconsin
On Wisconsin ¶

17:33.553 --> 17:35.319
¶ Plunge on through that line ¶¶

17:35.321 --> 17:38.122
Hey, hey, hey.
Hold it down in here!

17:40.760 --> 17:42.994
There you go.

17:44.898 --> 17:46.831
- Lucky?
- Huh?

17:46.833 --> 17:49.267
[grunting]

17:51.771 --> 17:53.905
Psst, hey.
Hey, Trigger.

17:53.907 --> 17:56.140
Shh! Act cool. Listen.

17:56.142 --> 17:57.408
You seem like a sweetheart.

17:57.410 --> 17:58.709
I'm gonna let you
break out of here

17:58.711 --> 18:00.044
with me tonight.

18:00.046 --> 18:02.280
Yeah. Here's the plan.

18:03.049 --> 18:05.016
We wait until it gets dark

18:05.018 --> 18:08.119
then me, you,
and that cat over there

18:08.121 --> 18:10.888
are gonna make a run
for it. Alright?

18:10.890 --> 18:13.424
Look, all you have to do

18:13.426 --> 18:16.160
is gnaw through this wire mesh.

18:16.696 --> 18:18.396
Got that?

18:18.398 --> 18:20.765
Good. Ixnay, ixnay. Okay.

18:20.767 --> 18:22.867
Well, there they are.
Take your pick.

18:22.869 --> 18:25.903
It<i> smells</i> terrible in here.

18:25.905 --> 18:27.205
Oh, you get used to it.

18:27.207 --> 18:29.273
Some of us wouldn't want to.

18:29.275 --> 18:30.775
Come on, Heidi,
pick a nice cat

18:30.777 --> 18:31.843
and then we'll go.

18:31.845 --> 18:33.945
I can't be rushed.

18:33.947 --> 18:35.713
Well, what kind of cat is that?

18:35.715 --> 18:37.315
Oh, I-I don't know.

18:37.317 --> 18:38.916
I don't know too much
about these things.

18:38.918 --> 18:40.852
- I only work here part-time.
- Mm-hmm.

18:40.854 --> 18:42.086
I'm-I'm an actor.

18:42.088 --> 18:43.721
My dad's a producer

18:43.723 --> 18:46.824
and he says
all actors are idiots.

18:47.627 --> 18:49.260
[laughing]

18:49.262 --> 18:50.761
Well, he's right.

18:50.763 --> 18:52.130
Alright, very nice
to meet you, sir.

18:52.132 --> 18:55.399
- Yeah.
- What is<i> that</i> monstrosity?

18:56.569 --> 18:58.269
(Keith)
Uh..

18:58.271 --> 19:00.238
...that's a dog.

19:00.240 --> 19:01.973
I think.

19:01.975 --> 19:05.343
Well, gas it.
No one's gonna want it.

19:05.345 --> 19:07.245
[growling]

19:07.247 --> 19:09.780
May I show you something
in a tabby?

19:09.782 --> 19:12.483
Now, this cat and I were
in a commercial together once.

19:12.485 --> 19:15.553
His face, my voice.
Maybe you saw it.

19:15.555 --> 19:17.655
"Oh, boy. Salmon Chips.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.023
They are purr-fect."

19:19.025 --> 19:20.725
I don't think so.

19:20.727 --> 19:22.493
I don't like any of these cats.

19:22.495 --> 19:25.129
I want one
that costs a lot of money.

19:25.131 --> 19:28.332
Come on, Heidi,
I'm sure you can find something.

19:28.334 --> 19:29.567
Oh, alright.

19:29.569 --> 19:32.503
I guess that cat there
doesn't look too gross.

19:32.505 --> 19:35.039
Ah, good.
Nice choice. Nice choice.

19:35.041 --> 19:37.308
Just came in
a little while ago.

19:40.747 --> 19:45.349
Okay...there you go.

19:45.351 --> 19:47.151
- What are you gonna name him?
- What's your name?

19:47.153 --> 19:48.819
- Keith.
- Not Keith.

19:48.821 --> 19:50.488
- Let's go, dad.
- Thanks very much.

19:50.490 --> 19:52.590
Oh, you're welcome.
Oh, listen.

19:52.592 --> 19:55.159
Listen, I'm appearing
in a small workshop production

19:55.161 --> 19:56.894
of "Extremities"
this weekend.

19:56.896 --> 19:58.095
Uh, if you're
in the neighborhood

19:58.097 --> 19:59.697
I'm the one
in the fireplace.

19:59.699 --> 20:01.632
Looks like it's now or never.

20:03.336 --> 20:04.702
[clattering]

20:04.704 --> 20:06.537
Uh, hey! Hey, hey!

20:06.539 --> 20:08.139
Hey! Hold it down!

20:08.141 --> 20:09.774
I'm auditioning here.

20:09.776 --> 20:11.576
[clattering]

20:11.578 --> 20:13.010
Did you hear what I said?

20:13.012 --> 20:15.713
Be quiet, you're scaring Damian.

20:15.715 --> 20:17.148
Alright, alright, that's it!

20:17.150 --> 20:19.250
[clattering continues]

20:20.320 --> 20:21.485
Oh! Oh!

20:21.487 --> 20:23.688
[upbeat music]

20:23.690 --> 20:25.556
Dad, that dog took my cat!

20:25.558 --> 20:26.924
Stop him!

20:35.868 --> 20:37.735
[keys jingling]

20:37.737 --> 20:39.103
They're here, Lucky.

20:39.105 --> 20:41.038
I just can't wait
to see their faces

20:41.040 --> 20:42.707
when they see you.

20:42.709 --> 20:44.008
[door opens]

20:45.578 --> 20:46.577
[Kate sighs]

20:49.515 --> 20:52.250
- ALF, you're back!
- Thank goodness.

20:52.252 --> 20:54.652
We've been looking
all over for you.

20:54.654 --> 20:57.088
Uh, before you say another word

20:57.090 --> 21:00.958
may I present to you
"Exhibit B?"

21:02.095 --> 21:05.396
Well, I guess
this case is closed.

21:05.932 --> 21:07.298
It's a cat.

21:07.300 --> 21:10.534
It's not just any cat,
it's Lucky!

21:10.536 --> 21:12.570
How soon they forget.

21:12.572 --> 21:17.208
Uh, ALF, uh, I-I think
you've made a mistake.

21:17.777 --> 21:19.844
- ALF.
- Lucky?

21:19.846 --> 21:22.213
Yeah, it's Lucky.

21:25.451 --> 21:27.585
You know,
it's a, it's a funny thing

21:27.587 --> 21:30.688
he was in Mrs. Ochmonek's
basement the whole time.

21:30.690 --> 21:33.557
Well, don't we feel foolish.

21:34.560 --> 21:37.128
Now we have two cats.

21:37.130 --> 21:39.030
No problem.

21:39.032 --> 21:41.265
You're getting sleepy.

21:41.267 --> 21:44.068
- ALF!
- Just kidding!

21:47.340 --> 21:48.572
[tapping]

21:49.542 --> 21:51.809
There you go, Luckheimer.

21:51.811 --> 21:53.210
Ooh, yeah.

21:53.212 --> 21:56.147
[laughs]
Who'd ever thought
we'd see the day

21:56.149 --> 21:59.016
when they'd trust me
to feed you, huh?

21:59.018 --> 22:01.152
[laughs]
Yeah.

22:01.154 --> 22:03.554
Right now,
I'm in the catbird seat

22:03.556 --> 22:04.989
so to speak.

22:04.991 --> 22:08.426
Right now,
I can get away with murder..

22:08.428 --> 22:09.960
...so to speak.

22:09.962 --> 22:11.796
Right now,
I could walk over

22:11.798 --> 22:13.531
to that refrigerator over there

22:13.533 --> 22:16.734
grab a couple of slices
of whole-wheat bread

22:16.736 --> 22:21.172
a little mayo,
and slap together a B-L-T.

22:21.174 --> 22:24.141
Bacon, Lucky, and Tomato.

22:24.143 --> 22:25.376
[ALF laughing]

22:25.378 --> 22:28.245
Yeah. Yeah.
I could do that.

22:28.247 --> 22:29.580
And they wouldn't even
have the nerve

22:29.582 --> 22:31.982
to point their finger
at the old ALFer.

22:31.984 --> 22:34.652
No, they'd probably
blame Willie

22:34.654 --> 22:36.487
before they'd blame me.

22:36.489 --> 22:38.489
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

22:38.491 --> 22:40.157
I could do that.

22:40.793 --> 22:42.226
But I won't.

22:42.962 --> 22:44.895
And why is that?

22:44.897 --> 22:47.431
Because they trust me.

22:51.537 --> 22:53.804
[clicks tongue]

22:53.806 --> 22:55.806
But don't get too comfortable.

old records off the shelf ¶

I'll be late for the door ¶
