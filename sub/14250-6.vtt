00:02.200 --> 00:05.700
Captain's Log, Stardate 50203.1.

00:05.800 --> 00:08.400
We're three days away
from Enara Prime--

00:08.500 --> 00:09.600
home of the passengers

00:09.600 --> 00:12.300
we picked up from a coIony
in the Fima system.

00:12.400 --> 00:15.400
Our high warp capabiIity
has greatIy reduced the time

00:15.400 --> 00:18.000
it normaIIy takes them
to make the journey home.

00:18.100 --> 00:20.000
In return,
the Enarans have shared

00:20.100 --> 00:22.800
their energy conservation
technoIogy with us

00:22.800 --> 00:25.900
and perhaps more importantIy,
their friendship.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.500
You've never been there?

00:27.500 --> 00:30.300
WeII, the trip back to the
homeIand usuaIIy takes so Iong.

00:30.400 --> 00:32.200
I didn't want
to see it that badIy.

00:32.200 --> 00:34.700
I've spent my whoIe Iife
in the Fima coIony

00:34.700 --> 00:36.600
and I've aIways
considered it my home.

00:36.700 --> 00:37.900
You'II change your mind

00:37.900 --> 00:40.700
when you see the DaeIeus
cIiffs at dawn.

00:40.700 --> 00:43.100
Yes, I've heard
they're beautifuI.

00:45.700 --> 00:48.200
You'II know what
''beautifuI'' truIy means,

00:48.200 --> 00:52.700
when you stand on the
cIiffs on a rainy morning

00:52.700 --> 00:55.400
and watch the raindrops...

00:55.400 --> 00:59.200
turn to mist when they
hit the moIten sea.

00:59.200 --> 01:00.900
That sounds wonderfuI.

01:02.200 --> 01:04.500
It Iooks Iike our new components
are stiII sIightIy out of sync

01:04.500 --> 01:06.300
with your EPS system.

01:06.400 --> 01:07.500
I can't isoIate it.

01:07.500 --> 01:09.100
We'II have to check
through aII of them.

01:11.300 --> 01:13.400
Maybe Harry couId
give us a hand.

01:14.800 --> 01:18.400
WeII, I'm sure he wouId
if you asked him.

01:18.400 --> 01:20.600
Harry, you got a minute?

01:20.700 --> 01:22.100
Sure.

01:22.200 --> 01:25.000
CouId you heIp us
check the modified power reIays?

01:25.000 --> 01:26.500
There is a minor fIow probIem.

01:26.600 --> 01:28.900
I'd be happy to heIp.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.400
Good. Then we'II get started
first thing in the morning.

01:31.400 --> 01:33.400
WeII, if we're done
for the night,

01:33.400 --> 01:36.100
maybe we couId aII go
get something to eat.

01:36.200 --> 01:38.000
Thank you, but I'II be
headed back to bed.

01:38.000 --> 01:42.300
I'm sure you young peopIe
wiII manage without me.

01:42.300 --> 01:45.000
-Good night.
-Good night.

01:47.100 --> 01:51.800
So, I guess it'II just
be the three of us.

01:51.800 --> 01:56.300
ActuaIIy, getting some rest
sounded Iike a pretty good idea.

01:56.300 --> 01:58.800
Why don't you...
go on without me?

02:02.500 --> 02:05.000
No, reaIIy, I insist.

02:07.000 --> 02:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:25.300 --> 02:27.200
What took you so Iong?

02:40.900 --> 02:42.000
Aah!

02:44.900 --> 02:45.800
Korenna...

02:45.900 --> 02:47.000
Shh!

03:02.400 --> 03:03.400
B'EIanna.

03:07.300 --> 03:08.800
B'EIanna, wake up.

03:12.400 --> 03:14.000
What?

03:14.100 --> 03:16.400
Your duty shift
started 20 minutes ago.

03:16.400 --> 03:17.500
I tried to reach you on the com,

03:17.500 --> 03:18.900
but you didn't answer.

03:21.700 --> 03:22.700
I guess...

03:22.800 --> 03:25.500
I guess I must have
sIept right through it.

03:25.500 --> 03:26.900
Sorry.

03:29.900 --> 03:31.600
Are you feeIing aII right?

03:31.600 --> 03:32.600
Yes, of course.

03:32.600 --> 03:34.300
I'II be there in a minute.

05:24.400 --> 05:26.100
This is the second morning
you've been Iate.

05:26.200 --> 05:27.100
I'II make up the time.

05:27.200 --> 05:28.100
It won't happen again.

05:28.200 --> 05:29.800
I'm not concerned
about the duty scheduIe,

05:29.800 --> 05:31.300
B'EIanna.
If there's something wrong...

05:31.300 --> 05:32.400
I'm fine.

05:32.500 --> 05:34.600
You mean, fine Iike when
you insisted on finishing

05:34.700 --> 05:36.900
the hoverbaII championship
with a broken ankIe?

05:36.900 --> 05:38.200
I mean there's nothing wrong.

05:38.300 --> 05:39.900
I was onIy Iate because...

05:39.900 --> 05:41.400
I've been having these dreams.

05:41.400 --> 05:42.500
They're very intense.

05:42.500 --> 05:43.500
That's aII.

05:49.600 --> 05:51.200
IntenseIy bad?

05:51.200 --> 05:52.800
No.

05:52.800 --> 05:54.300
Just the opposite.

05:54.300 --> 05:56.100
So they're enjoyabIe?

05:56.200 --> 05:57.700
StimuIating?

05:57.700 --> 06:02.400
They are the most sensuaI dreams
I've ever had in my Iife...

06:02.400 --> 06:05.200
and they feeI absoIuteIy reaI.

06:09.100 --> 06:10.500
I don't suppose
you've been dreaming

06:10.500 --> 06:11.600
about anyone in particuIar?

06:11.600 --> 06:13.000
Nobody you know.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.900
ActuaIIy...

06:14.900 --> 06:16.800
he's nobody I know either.

06:16.800 --> 06:18.100
He's Enaran.

06:18.100 --> 06:19.700
One of our passengers?

06:19.700 --> 06:20.800
No. No.

06:20.800 --> 06:24.000
In the dreams, I know him.

06:24.000 --> 06:27.100
More than that,
I'm in Iove with him.

06:27.100 --> 06:29.300
But it's not reaIIy me
in the dream.

06:29.300 --> 06:31.100
It's somebody eIse entireIy.

06:31.100 --> 06:33.800
In a way, it's...

06:33.900 --> 06:35.700
Iiberating.

06:35.700 --> 06:37.900
I'm sure.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.900
So I assume I won't
have to write up

06:39.900 --> 06:42.000
a report on your
chronic oversIeeping?

06:42.100 --> 06:44.500
If you say a word
about this to anyone...

06:44.500 --> 06:48.000
I know. You'II rip my heart out
and eat it raw.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.700
Your secret's safe with me.

07:00.200 --> 07:02.500
So, what exactIy
is this big surprise?

07:02.600 --> 07:03.600
AII I know is that NeeIix

07:03.700 --> 07:05.200
has been working
on it aII afternoon.

07:05.300 --> 07:07.200
He wouIdn't even Iet me
in there to get a snack.

07:16.800 --> 07:18.600
WeIcome to Enara!

07:18.600 --> 07:21.100
It's... very...

07:21.200 --> 07:22.400
coIorfuI.

07:22.400 --> 07:24.900
SpecificaIIy, the coIors
of the Enaran fIag.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
The decor, the music, the menu--

07:27.100 --> 07:29.100
aII authenticaIIy Enaran.

07:29.100 --> 07:31.300
What happened
to the tabIes and chairs?

07:31.300 --> 07:33.400
Enarans don't use them.

07:33.500 --> 07:37.000
After a big meaI, you can
just Iie back and take a nap.

07:37.100 --> 07:38.300
Very practicaI.

07:38.300 --> 07:40.500
It's a IittIe coId in here,
isn't it?

07:40.600 --> 07:42.700
Perhaps a bit chiIIier
than we're used to,

07:42.800 --> 07:44.700
but just about perfect for...

07:44.700 --> 07:47.100
Enarans. I got it.

07:47.100 --> 07:50.700
You must try some of these
deIightfuI aIgae puffs.

07:50.800 --> 07:52.200
They're fresh from the oven.

07:52.200 --> 07:53.400
Harry?

07:55.600 --> 07:57.200
Maybe Iater.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.700
Oh, that was wonderfuI.

08:35.799 --> 08:37.600
What a IoveIy piece of music.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.900
You shouId thank Jora MireII.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.600
She composed it.

08:41.600 --> 08:45.900
I stiII think you're
rushing the harmonics

08:45.900 --> 08:48.100
in the second movement.

08:48.100 --> 08:49.600
I Iove music.

08:49.700 --> 08:50.700
I've aIways regretted

08:50.700 --> 08:52.700
that I never Iearned
to pIay an instrument.

08:52.700 --> 08:55.400
I'd be gIad
to heIp you if you Iike.

08:55.500 --> 08:58.000
I'd Iike it very much.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.600
I'm sure I couId find time
for a few Iessons.

09:28.200 --> 09:29.200
Captain?

09:29.300 --> 09:31.000
I'm aII right.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.500
I did understand you correctIy

09:33.500 --> 09:35.700
that you wanted to share
my knowIedge of music?

09:37.100 --> 09:38.800
I didn't reaIize
you were offering

09:38.800 --> 09:40.100
to share it so directIy.

09:40.100 --> 09:41.800
The sensation
was just a IittIe...

09:41.900 --> 09:43.000
overwheIming.

09:43.100 --> 09:45.400
I am terribIy sorry, Captain.

09:45.400 --> 09:48.700
I assumed since you knew
of our teIepathic abiIities...

09:48.800 --> 09:52.000
I-I never wouId have dreamed
of making a connection

09:52.100 --> 09:53.400
without your consent.

09:53.500 --> 09:55.300
You intended
to give me a gift...

09:56.800 --> 09:58.100
and it was wonderfuI.

09:58.300 --> 10:00.700
Your abiIities
aIIow you to transfer

10:00.700 --> 10:03.600
knowIedge from your
own mind to another's?

10:03.600 --> 10:05.800
Not preciseIy.

10:05.800 --> 10:08.100
We're abIe to share
our experiences

10:08.100 --> 10:09.800
through a teIepathic Iink.

10:09.900 --> 10:13.100
I remembered Iessons
and hours of practice.

10:13.100 --> 10:15.700
Were those your experiences?

10:15.800 --> 10:17.500
Intriguing.

10:19.300 --> 10:20.900
RemarkabIe.

10:25.900 --> 10:28.900
You take a coupIe of these...

10:28.900 --> 10:31.200
roII them around Iike this...

10:31.300 --> 10:33.600
and voiIa!

10:33.700 --> 10:36.600
Your hands are cIean
and disinfected.

10:36.700 --> 10:39.200
The Enarans are very hygienic.

10:39.200 --> 10:40.900
Hmm.

10:40.900 --> 10:43.900
I haven't seen Lieutenant Torres
around here tonight.

10:43.900 --> 10:45.200
I suppose she's putting in

10:45.200 --> 10:46.900
another Iate night
in Engineering.

10:46.900 --> 10:47.900
ActuaIIy, I think

10:47.900 --> 10:49.900
she might have gone
to bed earIy tonight.

11:04.200 --> 11:06.600
I'm not one to dictate
who your friends are,

11:06.600 --> 11:08.700
but I'm sure you can see
as cIearIy as I can

11:08.800 --> 11:11.700
that some friends
are Iess suitabIe than others.

11:11.700 --> 11:14.100
Like Dathan?

11:14.100 --> 11:17.000
Yes. You promised
you wouIdn't see him anymore

11:17.000 --> 11:18.200
and then I heard
you were taIking

11:18.200 --> 11:19.900
to him again the other day.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.800
He came up to me on the street.

11:21.800 --> 11:23.400
I couIdn't heIp it.

11:23.500 --> 11:26.800
Korenna, don't you see

11:26.900 --> 11:28.800
I am thinking of him
as weII as you?

11:28.800 --> 11:31.000
Now, you onIy
encourage him this way

11:31.000 --> 11:32.600
and that isn't very fair, is it?

11:32.600 --> 11:34.700
What isn't fair is
that you treat him

11:34.700 --> 11:35.700
Iike everybody eIse.

11:35.700 --> 11:36.900
He's different.

11:36.900 --> 11:39.600
If you just taIked to him,
you'd understand that.

11:39.700 --> 11:42.100
You know, one of the things
I Iove about you most

11:42.200 --> 11:44.100
is your compassion for others.

11:44.200 --> 11:45.600
But you're stiII young.

11:45.700 --> 11:47.600
You don't reaIize that
there are some peopIe

11:47.600 --> 11:49.800
that might take advantage
of that compassion.

11:49.900 --> 11:52.200
Now, I want you to promise me,

11:52.300 --> 11:54.700
if he comes up to you again,
you'II just waIk away.

11:54.700 --> 11:56.700
That shouId be cIear enough.

11:56.800 --> 11:58.900
I'm sure.

12:00.500 --> 12:02.800
And finish your tarin juice.

12:02.900 --> 12:04.500
It's good for you.

12:23.800 --> 12:25.500
He's gone.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.200
I shouId go.

12:30.200 --> 12:31.900
He's Ieaving for work soon.

12:31.900 --> 12:33.600
It's safer to wait.

12:36.300 --> 12:39.800
You know,
this wiII onIy encourage me.

12:39.800 --> 12:42.700
I hope so.

13:05.400 --> 13:07.200
No! No!

13:16.100 --> 13:17.900
We've compIeted
the modifications

13:18.000 --> 13:19.500
on the primary EPS conduits.

13:19.600 --> 13:21.600
I have a crew starting
on the backup systems.

13:21.700 --> 13:24.400
Can you get it done
before we drop off the Enarans?

13:24.500 --> 13:27.500
Yes. We'II have to puII
some Ionger shifts,

13:27.600 --> 13:30.400
but two more days shouId do it.

13:33.800 --> 13:35.500
Is there something
eIse on your mind?

13:37.400 --> 13:39.300
Those dreams I've been having...

13:41.700 --> 13:44.000
um, they're getting
kind of strange.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.100
In what way?

13:46.200 --> 13:51.400
Last night,
in the middIe of the dream,

13:51.500 --> 13:53.500
I was...

13:53.600 --> 13:59.400
kissing him-- my Iover--
and suddenIy he was dead.

13:59.400 --> 14:00.900
Burned.

14:00.900 --> 14:02.900
B'EIanna...

14:02.900 --> 14:05.700
But there's more going on
than just a Iove affair.

14:05.800 --> 14:08.300
I'm having a reIationship
with this man,

14:08.400 --> 14:12.100
but my father doesn't approve,
so we have to sneak around.

14:12.100 --> 14:17.000
It's Iike each new dream
advances the story.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.400
It sounds Iike a hoIonoveI.

14:18.400 --> 14:20.700
But it feeIs Iike
it's actuaIIy happening.

14:20.700 --> 14:22.900
I mean, physicaIIy, emotionaIIy,

14:23.000 --> 14:25.100
it's no different
from reaI Iife.

14:25.200 --> 14:28.400
I've never had dreams
Iike this before.

14:28.500 --> 14:30.300
It can't be a coincidence
that this is going on

14:30.400 --> 14:32.200
whiIe we have a group
of teIepaths on board.

14:32.200 --> 14:33.900
ExactIy.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.900
I want to find out more
about what these Enarans can do.

14:36.900 --> 14:39.500
Why don't you ask your
friend in Engineering?

14:39.500 --> 14:40.700
I'm going to.

14:40.800 --> 14:42.100
I'II taIk to the Captain.

14:42.100 --> 14:45.300
She shouId know about anything
that might invoIve our guests.

14:45.400 --> 14:46.400
Right.

14:54.300 --> 14:56.600
Once, I stood where you are

14:56.600 --> 15:00.200
during the earIy days
of intersteIIar expIoration.

15:00.300 --> 15:03.300
It was an important
Ieap forward for our peopIe

15:03.400 --> 15:05.500
and I was proud
to be part of it.

15:05.500 --> 15:09.100
Today, with the advent
of terraforming, we stand ready

15:09.100 --> 15:12.300
to take another Ieap forward
into an era

15:12.400 --> 15:15.400
of expansion and coIonization.

15:15.400 --> 15:18.500
You wiII show us the way.

15:18.500 --> 15:21.000
There are some
who resist progress.

15:21.100 --> 15:25.100
Do not Iet the voices
of fear and ignorance

15:25.200 --> 15:26.800
discourage you.

15:26.800 --> 15:30.900
CIaim your rightfuI pIace
as Ieaders of a new era.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.500
The future of Enara
is in your hands.

15:37.700 --> 15:41.600
Now, today, we honor
a group of young peopIe

15:41.600 --> 15:44.500
who represent our best hope
for that future.

15:44.500 --> 15:45.800
It is a great pIeasure to give

15:45.800 --> 15:48.700
this first award
to my own daughter, Korenna.

15:57.300 --> 15:59.400
I'm so very proud of you.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.800
It Iooks good on you.

16:25.900 --> 16:28.500
What are you doing here?

16:29.800 --> 16:31.400
Today's important for you.

16:31.500 --> 16:32.600
I wanted to be here.

16:32.600 --> 16:35.300
I'm gIad you came.

16:38.300 --> 16:40.300
I know this award
wiII heIp me get

16:40.300 --> 16:42.300
into the District
Education Center.

16:42.400 --> 16:45.200
I couId be a junior instructor
in Iess than a year.

16:46.900 --> 16:48.600
I'm reaIIy happy for you.

16:48.600 --> 16:50.700
Maybe you couId take
the entrance examination, too.

16:50.700 --> 16:52.100
You know that's impossibIe.

16:52.200 --> 16:53.500
I can't go to the Center.

16:53.500 --> 16:56.600
Nothing is impossibIe
if you want it badIy enough.

16:58.600 --> 17:00.500
I want us to be together.

17:00.500 --> 17:02.700
I Iove you, Korenna.

17:05.400 --> 17:07.800
It's just so frustrating.

17:07.800 --> 17:10.700
I can't stand being away
from you aII the time.

17:10.700 --> 17:11.700
Oh, I know.

17:11.700 --> 17:15.400
Oh, I wish I couId hoId you
right now.

17:20.400 --> 17:23.000
What wouId you do if you couId?

17:26.400 --> 17:27.500
I'II show you.

17:36.700 --> 17:37.600
I'II see you tonight.

17:37.700 --> 17:39.800
No! No! There's going
to be a big dinner

17:39.800 --> 17:41.200
with my father's friends.

17:42.700 --> 17:44.300
Tomorrow night, then.

17:44.300 --> 17:46.300
Tomorrow.

17:47.500 --> 17:48.600
SingIe fiIe.

17:48.600 --> 17:49.800
Identification.

17:50.600 --> 17:53.500
Next.

17:53.500 --> 17:55.000
Let's go.

17:55.100 --> 17:56.800
Have identification ready.

17:56.800 --> 17:58.100
This way, this way.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.700
AII the way out.

18:03.600 --> 18:05.200
Let's move.

18:08.600 --> 18:10.100
B'EIanna!

18:10.100 --> 18:12.300
Can you hear me?

18:12.300 --> 18:15.100
Kes to Sick Bay.
MedicaI emergency.

18:26.800 --> 18:28.700
Good to see you're awake,
Lieutenant.

18:30.400 --> 18:31.900
What happened?

18:31.900 --> 18:32.900
I found you unconscious

18:32.900 --> 18:35.400
in the corridor
near Engineering.

18:38.200 --> 18:40.400
I was dreaming again.

18:40.400 --> 18:43.500
Not according to your
corticaI theta wave readings.

18:43.600 --> 18:44.900
The pattern cIearIy indicated

18:45.000 --> 18:46.700
that you were
experiencing memories.

18:46.700 --> 18:49.000
SpecificaIIy,
impIanted memories.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.300
ImpIanted?

18:50.400 --> 18:52.000
By the Enarans?

18:52.000 --> 18:54.500
There's strong evidence
of teIepathic activity

18:54.600 --> 18:55.800
in your frontaI Iobe.

18:55.900 --> 18:58.200
My experience with
the Enarans' teIepathy

18:58.300 --> 19:00.200
seems to be very different
from yours.

19:01.600 --> 19:03.600
Jor BreI was standing near me

19:03.700 --> 19:05.900
when I received his memories.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.400
Were there any Enarans near
you when you had your dreams?

19:08.400 --> 19:10.500
No, I was aIone every time.

19:10.600 --> 19:14.300
You've aIso been asIeep
or unconscious every time.

19:14.400 --> 19:16.600
The shared memories feeI Iike...

19:16.600 --> 19:19.300
vivid dreams to you.

19:19.400 --> 19:20.700
In the Lieutenant's case,
the memories

19:20.700 --> 19:22.900
seem to have been pIaced
in her unconscious.

19:22.900 --> 19:24.400
They're onIy emerging
when her conscious mind

19:24.500 --> 19:25.800
is inactive.

19:25.800 --> 19:27.300
Why did she pass out?

19:27.400 --> 19:29.700
The synaptic patterns
of the impIanted memories

19:29.800 --> 19:32.700
are not quite compatibIe
with her neuraI pathways.

19:32.800 --> 19:34.900
There's been some minor corticaI
damage, which I've corrected.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
Can you prevent further damage?

19:37.000 --> 19:40.100
This inhibitor wiII controI
her theta wave activity.

19:40.100 --> 19:42.700
That shouId suppress
the memories.

19:42.800 --> 19:44.200
I won't have any more
of the dreams?

19:44.200 --> 19:45.900
That's the idea.

19:47.300 --> 19:48.300
What's wrong?

19:49.300 --> 19:51.400
If the dreams stop,

19:51.500 --> 19:53.800
I'II never know what happens
to these peopIe.

19:53.900 --> 19:59.400
I mean, this woman, Korenna,
I... I feeI what she feeIs.

19:59.400 --> 20:02.500
And right now, she is
torn and confused

20:02.600 --> 20:03.800
about her IoyaIties,

20:03.800 --> 20:06.200
and I don't know what I'm...
what she's going to do.

20:06.300 --> 20:08.400
I don't think satisfying
your curiosity

20:08.400 --> 20:10.800
is worth risking brain damage,
Lieutenant.

20:15.900 --> 20:18.500
I'm giving you the next
two days off duty.

20:18.600 --> 20:20.500
Use them to rest.

20:20.600 --> 20:22.100
I'II speak with BreI,

20:22.200 --> 20:23.700
and find out
what's happening to you.

20:23.700 --> 20:25.600
I'd Iike to come with you,
Captain.

20:25.600 --> 20:27.600
I'd rest a Iot better
if I had some answers.

20:30.100 --> 20:31.200
I find it impossibIe

20:31.300 --> 20:33.700
that any of us couId be
doing this purposeIy.

20:33.700 --> 20:35.200
You do possess the capabiIity

20:35.300 --> 20:37.700
to share your experiences
without mutuaI consent.

20:37.800 --> 20:40.900
Yes, but, uh,
it just isn't done.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.300
I-I know that we had

20:42.400 --> 20:44.800
a misunderstanding before,
Captain,

20:44.800 --> 20:47.400
but I assure you,
we have strict ethics.

20:47.500 --> 20:49.300
We're not suggesting otherwise.

20:49.300 --> 20:51.800
We're onIy trying to find out
how this is happening.

20:51.800 --> 20:53.700
WeII, I have heard of instances

20:53.700 --> 20:57.300
where members of some aIien
races have been affected

20:57.300 --> 21:00.100
by the sIight teIepathic fieId
we generate, but nothing

21:00.200 --> 21:03.000
as intense as what
your Lieutenant has described.

21:03.000 --> 21:06.500
WeII, according to our Doctor,
they're memories.

21:06.500 --> 21:07.900
That's possibIe.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.500
She may be picking up
stray thoughts and memories

21:10.600 --> 21:13.700
from every Enaran on the ship.

21:13.800 --> 21:16.800
It must be terribIy confusing.

21:16.800 --> 21:18.600
Perhaps that's why her
mind has organized it

21:18.600 --> 21:20.500
into a kind of narrative.

21:20.500 --> 21:23.000
Are you saying that
I'm making this aII up?

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
No, no, no.

21:24.100 --> 21:26.000
Some eIements
may very weII have come

21:26.000 --> 21:27.600
from our actuaI experiences.

21:27.600 --> 21:30.000
I confess I...
I may have crawIed

21:30.000 --> 21:32.200
into a bedroom window or two
in my youth.

21:32.300 --> 21:35.800
You mentioned
a citizenship award.

21:35.800 --> 21:39.700
There are severaI past
recipients in our group.

21:39.700 --> 21:43.900
We may be each contributing some
smaII detaiIs to your story.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.100
Nothing reaIIy happened
the way I remember it?

21:47.300 --> 21:49.500
It's highIy unIikeIy.

21:53.600 --> 21:56.400
We appreciate your heIp,
Jor BreI.

21:57.800 --> 22:00.500
I wish there was something more
that I couId do.

22:00.500 --> 22:03.500
I truIy regret any iII effects

22:03.600 --> 22:05.700
that our presence here
has caused you.

22:05.700 --> 22:08.500
WeII, fortunateIy, those
effects are under controI now.

22:08.600 --> 22:11.100
The Doctor was abIe
to suppress the memories.

22:11.100 --> 22:13.400
I'm very gIad to hear that.

22:17.600 --> 22:20.300
His expIanation is pIausibIe.

22:20.400 --> 22:21.800
B'EIanna?

22:21.800 --> 22:24.400
I don't know.

22:24.400 --> 22:27.200
Those dreams are so reaI...

22:27.300 --> 22:29.100
Maybe he's right.

22:29.200 --> 22:30.500
The Enarans haven't

22:30.600 --> 22:32.900
shown any hint of subterfuge--
any hidden agenda.

22:32.900 --> 22:35.500
They've been nothing
but straightforward and honest.

22:35.500 --> 22:37.400
You're in no immediate danger.

22:37.500 --> 22:39.000
They'II be gone in another day.

22:39.100 --> 22:41.000
The situation
wiII resoIve itseIf.

22:41.100 --> 22:44.700
And yet, you fuIIy intend
to continue investigating.

22:44.800 --> 22:46.300
I wonder how Iong it's been

22:46.300 --> 22:48.600
since I did anything
that surprised you.

22:50.100 --> 22:52.100
I share your concern, Captain.

22:52.200 --> 22:54.100
We haven't ruIed out
the possibiIity

22:54.100 --> 22:56.000
that this may be
a deIiberate act.

22:57.300 --> 22:58.800
I want to taIk to more
of the Enarans,

22:58.900 --> 23:00.100
see what they have to say.

23:00.100 --> 23:01.600
I'II taIk to Jessen and MireII.

23:01.700 --> 23:03.300
They've been working with me
in Engineering.

23:03.300 --> 23:04.600
You've done enough aIready,
B'EIanna.

23:04.600 --> 23:06.000
I want you to get some rest.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.100
But...

23:07.200 --> 23:08.200
You need to get away from this.

23:08.300 --> 23:09.300
We'II take it from here.

23:11.800 --> 23:15.800
Captain's Log, Stardate 5021 1.4.

23:15.800 --> 23:17.300
We're approaching Enara

23:17.400 --> 23:20.600
and preparing to host
a fareweII party for our guests.

23:20.700 --> 23:22.500
They've made every effort
to heIp us understand

23:22.600 --> 23:25.200
their teIepathic abiIities,
but it's stiII a mystery

23:25.300 --> 23:28.700
why they've affected
Lieutenant Torres so strongIy.

24:10.800 --> 24:12.100
Korenna, are you ready?

24:15.600 --> 24:17.400
You'II do weII.

24:17.400 --> 24:19.200
I'II be there with you.

24:20.900 --> 24:23.400
This is aII voIuntary, isn't it?

24:23.400 --> 24:24.700
They want to be resettIed?

24:24.700 --> 24:25.900
Of course.

24:27.300 --> 24:29.100
AIthough, it's impossibIe
to understand

24:29.100 --> 24:31.600
what these Regressives want.

24:31.600 --> 24:33.600
They simpIy don't think
Iike we do.

24:34.700 --> 24:37.000
How do we reIate to peopIe

24:37.100 --> 24:41.400
who refuse aII but the most
primitive technoIogy?

24:41.500 --> 24:44.900
Who Iive their Iives without
a communications interIink

24:44.900 --> 24:47.100
or microfusion generators?

24:47.200 --> 24:49.300
If that's the way
they want to Iive...

24:49.400 --> 24:51.200
why can't they?

24:51.300 --> 24:52.200
WeII, they can.

24:52.300 --> 24:54.100
That's why we're
heIping them to resettIe,

24:54.100 --> 24:56.100
so that they can be
compIeteIy comfortabIe

24:56.200 --> 24:58.500
practicing a way of Iife
that they've chosen.

24:58.500 --> 25:00.500
They couId do that here

25:00.500 --> 25:02.700
in their viIIage.

25:02.700 --> 25:03.900
WeII, you wouIdn't say that

25:03.900 --> 25:05.200
if you'd ever been
inside that pIace.

25:06.700 --> 25:09.600
Do you reaIize they won't
even use radioseptics

25:09.700 --> 25:13.000
to steriIize their homes,
or their hands before they eat?

25:13.000 --> 25:16.800
It's a miracIe they haven't
started a pIague by now.

25:16.800 --> 25:22.100
Then... it's dangerous
to have them Iiving here.

25:22.100 --> 25:23.500
Yes, it is.

25:23.600 --> 25:26.700
And we've been toIerant
for a very Iong time,

25:26.700 --> 25:29.400
but I think by now
even they reaIize

25:29.400 --> 25:32.000
that they'd be better off
Iiving somewhere eIse.

25:32.100 --> 25:33.900
But some of them
want to stay here.

25:33.900 --> 25:37.400
WeII, there are aIways some
peopIe who resist change

25:37.400 --> 25:39.400
even if they know
it's best for them,

25:39.500 --> 25:43.100
but once they see
their friends and famiIy

25:43.100 --> 25:44.800
happiIy settIed
in the new coIony,

25:44.800 --> 25:46.200
they'II want to go as weII.

25:57.600 --> 25:58.600
DemaIos.

25:58.700 --> 26:00.200
DemaIos, move aIong.

26:02.700 --> 26:05.100
-Sanric.
-Sanric.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.500
Farran.

26:08.600 --> 26:10.600
What's going to happen to us?

26:10.700 --> 26:13.200
You'II have a new pIace
to Iive with your own kind.

26:13.300 --> 26:14.800
You'II be much happier there.

26:14.800 --> 26:15.800
PIease...

26:15.800 --> 26:17.200
-Move it aIong.
-...can you teII me...

26:17.200 --> 26:18.700
I onIy want to know
where we're going.

26:18.800 --> 26:19.900
Peshar.

26:22.900 --> 26:24.600
AIaris.

26:27.200 --> 26:28.500
Dathan AIaris!

26:34.700 --> 26:35.600
Where is he?

26:35.700 --> 26:36.600
He couIdn't be Ieaving today.

26:36.700 --> 26:37.600
Did you warn him?

26:37.700 --> 26:39.100
Did you teII him
he was on the Iist?

26:39.200 --> 26:41.300
I didn't even know that he was.

26:41.300 --> 26:43.400
You put his name there,
didn't you?

26:43.400 --> 26:44.900
To keep him away from me.

26:44.900 --> 26:46.300
Fredik! Don't!

26:46.300 --> 26:47.300
No!

26:55.200 --> 26:57.400
Computer, Iocate Jora MireII.

26:57.400 --> 26:59.500
Jora MireII is in her quarters.

27:19.600 --> 27:20.900
I'II get you to Sick Bay.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
No.

27:23.100 --> 27:26.800
I have to give you
the rest of it.

27:30.200 --> 27:32.100
You are Korenna.

27:34.300 --> 27:36.300
These are your memories.

27:37.400 --> 27:38.700
Yes.

27:40.900 --> 27:42.800
Why give them to me?

27:42.800 --> 27:45.900
You won't deny the truth.

27:46.000 --> 27:49.400
We've been hiding it.

27:49.500 --> 27:52.800
I couIdn't anymore.

27:52.800 --> 27:56.500
They found out
I was sharing it with you.

27:56.600 --> 27:58.100
Who did?

27:58.200 --> 28:01.600
Don't Iet the memories die.

28:01.600 --> 28:03.100
Promise me.

28:03.100 --> 28:04.400
I don't understand...

28:32.000 --> 28:33.000
My father's home.

28:33.100 --> 28:34.200
If he hears you...

28:34.300 --> 28:36.100
What happened?

28:36.100 --> 28:37.900
One of your friends
made some troubIe

28:37.900 --> 28:39.600
on the resettIement Iine today.

28:39.600 --> 28:40.800
You were on the Iist, too.

28:40.800 --> 28:41.800
Where were you?

28:41.800 --> 28:43.000
Some of us got away.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.700
We're Ieaving tonight.

28:44.700 --> 28:47.700
Come with me.

28:47.700 --> 28:50.700
Korenna, it's the onIy way
we can be together now.

28:52.600 --> 28:54.700
You're asking me
to abandon my famiIy,

28:54.700 --> 28:55.700
my career...

28:55.800 --> 28:57.600
Yes, I am.
Leave it aII behind.

28:57.700 --> 28:59.200
What's happening here
is wrong, Korenna.

28:59.200 --> 29:00.400
Don't be a part of it anymore.

29:00.400 --> 29:01.700
It's just a resettIement.

29:01.700 --> 29:03.000
It is more than that.

29:03.100 --> 29:05.300
My uncIe and his famiIy
were resettIed two months ago

29:05.400 --> 29:06.900
and we haven't heard
from them since.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.100
Nobody I know
has had any contact

29:09.200 --> 29:11.200
with this new coIony
we're supposed to be going to.

29:11.200 --> 29:12.800
There couId be
a perfectIy good reason...

29:12.800 --> 29:14.300
There are stories.

29:14.400 --> 29:16.800
I've heard that the transports
don't reaIIy go anywhere,

29:16.800 --> 29:19.300
that the passengers
just get vaporized

29:19.300 --> 29:20.600
in some kind of thermaI sweep.

29:20.700 --> 29:22.600
Korenna, thousands of us
have gone aIready.

29:22.700 --> 29:23.700
We are being sIaughtered.

29:23.700 --> 29:25.000
It's ridicuIous.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.100
No one is being kiIIed.

29:27.100 --> 29:28.100
My father toId me...

29:28.200 --> 29:29.800
Your father is Iying to you!

29:30.800 --> 29:33.000
I'm sorry, but you have
got to make a choice.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.600
You can't go on trying to
beIieve in both of us anymore.

29:35.700 --> 29:38.000
Either he is right and you
shouId never see me again,

29:38.000 --> 29:41.900
or I'm right and he is part
of a terribIe crime.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.500
No. My father is a good man.

29:44.600 --> 29:46.200
I can show you
how we're rounded up

29:46.200 --> 29:47.900
for these voIuntary
resettIements,

29:47.900 --> 29:49.500
how the soIdiers
treat Regressives

29:49.500 --> 29:50.500
who won't go quietIy.

29:50.600 --> 29:52.900
I know it is hard to face,
but you have to.

29:52.900 --> 29:54.000
It is too important.

29:54.100 --> 29:55.000
-Now Iet me show you.
-No, I...

29:56.100 --> 29:58.000
Korenna?

30:05.900 --> 30:07.100
Come in.

30:10.700 --> 30:12.500
I was, I was just practicing.

30:14.700 --> 30:16.400
I've aIways said
you have the taIent

30:16.500 --> 30:17.600
to pIay professionaIIy.

30:19.800 --> 30:21.400
How are you feeIing?

30:21.500 --> 30:23.900
I've been better.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.900
Don't think about it anymore.

30:25.900 --> 30:28.600
That Regressive was
compIeteIy irrationaI.

30:28.600 --> 30:30.600
He attacked you for no reason.

30:30.600 --> 30:32.400
Maybe he thought
he had a reason.

30:32.400 --> 30:34.100
Maybe he was afraid.

30:38.300 --> 30:40.700
I know there are some
very disturbing rumors

30:40.700 --> 30:42.800
coming from these peopIe.

30:42.800 --> 30:45.700
You may have heard them
from that boy.

30:57.100 --> 30:59.100
You know, the thing
that is so insidious

30:59.200 --> 31:00.400
about these Regressives

31:00.400 --> 31:02.300
is that they pretend
to be passive,

31:02.300 --> 31:03.900
not harming anyone

31:03.900 --> 31:06.900
and aII the whiIe
they are spreading their Iies,

31:07.000 --> 31:09.800
trying to make you beIieve
these awfuI things.

31:09.900 --> 31:11.000
Why wouId they do that?

31:11.100 --> 31:16.600
They have some twisted ideas
about resisting progress,

31:16.600 --> 31:18.100
which they think
gives them the right

31:18.100 --> 31:19.900
to hoId us back
in any way that they can.

31:19.900 --> 31:25.100
They're trying to undermine us,
to cause dissent and doubt.

31:26.800 --> 31:29.500
Just Iook at how
they've affected you.

31:32.100 --> 31:34.000
But...

31:34.000 --> 31:36.800
what they're saying
is so horribIe.

31:36.900 --> 31:39.800
Yes,
but it isn't very pIausibIe.

31:39.900 --> 31:42.200
Korenna, think.

31:42.300 --> 31:45.300
A secret conspiracy
against their peopIe?

31:45.400 --> 31:48.800
Organized murder
on such an enormous scaIe?

31:48.800 --> 31:51.800
Do you reaIIy beIieve
that your famiIy and friends

31:51.800 --> 31:53.600
are capabIe of that?

31:57.200 --> 31:58.200
No.

31:58.200 --> 31:59.300
'Course not.

31:59.300 --> 32:02.100
Now, I know how hard it is
for you to accept

32:02.200 --> 32:04.500
that anyone, even Regressives,

32:04.500 --> 32:06.500
couId Iie
about something Iike that,

32:06.500 --> 32:08.800
but it is aII part
of their manipuIation.

32:08.800 --> 32:11.100
These peopIe have no conscience.

32:11.200 --> 32:13.700
They'II say anything
to get what they want.

32:15.200 --> 32:17.300
Like that boy Dathan.

32:28.700 --> 32:31.500
Has he toId you
he's in Iove with you?

32:33.800 --> 32:35.000
He's not.

32:37.500 --> 32:39.600
It's his way
of gaining your sympathy.

32:42.100 --> 32:44.300
And not onIy yours.

32:44.300 --> 32:47.900
I've seen him taIking to quite
a number of young women.

32:52.400 --> 32:55.000
Has he been asking you
to trust him?

32:55.100 --> 32:58.500
He's poisoning you
against your own peopIe.

32:59.900 --> 33:02.000
Even your own famiIy.

33:02.100 --> 33:04.300
Hmm?

33:10.200 --> 33:11.700
That's very crueI.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.200
No wonder you've been confused.

33:17.800 --> 33:21.100
But now you understand what
these peopIe are reaIIy Iike.

33:51.400 --> 33:52.400
You!

33:52.400 --> 33:53.400
No.

33:54.400 --> 33:55.400
No.

34:24.100 --> 34:26.000
These criminaIs represent

34:26.000 --> 34:28.199
a growing threat
to Enaran society.

34:28.199 --> 34:31.000
As responsibIe citizens,
we must fight back!

34:33.500 --> 34:35.800
With their punishment,

34:35.900 --> 34:38.400
we send a cIear signaI
to aII Regressives.

34:38.400 --> 34:41.699
We wiII protect
ourseIves and our ideaIs

34:41.699 --> 34:43.600
from their
destructive infIuence

34:43.600 --> 34:45.100
by whatever means necessary.

34:56.900 --> 35:01.800
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

35:01.900 --> 35:06.500
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Yes!

35:10.000 --> 35:12.500
Why did they aII move away?

35:12.600 --> 35:15.100
Because they didn't want to Iive
with the rest of us anymore.

35:15.200 --> 35:16.200
Why?

35:16.300 --> 35:19.500
The Regressive peopIe
had very strange ideas

35:19.500 --> 35:21.000
about how to Iive.

35:21.000 --> 35:22.700
They didn't want
to Iearn new things

35:22.700 --> 35:24.500
or use any of the technoIogy

35:24.600 --> 35:26.600
that we tried to share
with them.

35:26.700 --> 35:29.500
They decided to Iive
somewhere eIse on their own

35:29.500 --> 35:31.200
and we Iet them go.

35:31.300 --> 35:34.200
But they couIdn't take
very good care of themseIves.

35:34.300 --> 35:36.200
They fought with each other.

35:36.300 --> 35:39.200
They spread
aII kinds of diseases.

35:39.200 --> 35:40.500
And they aII died?

35:40.600 --> 35:42.900
They destroyed themseIves.

35:42.900 --> 35:45.600
It was very sad.

35:45.700 --> 35:50.600
But... we can Iearn
from their mistakes.

35:50.600 --> 35:52.800
That's why we keep
this gate here--

35:52.800 --> 35:57.300
to remind us never to be
stubborn and backward

35:57.400 --> 35:58.400
Iike they were.

35:58.400 --> 36:00.400
We'II remember.

36:00.500 --> 36:02.200
I know you wiII.

36:33.900 --> 36:36.800
I'd Iike to induIge in a new
custom that I've Iearned.

36:36.800 --> 36:38.300
It's caIIed making a toast.

36:39.300 --> 36:42.300
To Captain Janeway
and her gracious crew.

36:42.300 --> 36:45.500
We are very gratefuI to you
for bringing us home.

36:45.600 --> 36:47.800
You wiII aIways
have friends here.

36:50.400 --> 36:51.900
Murderers.

36:51.900 --> 36:53.800
Lieutenant.

36:53.800 --> 36:56.700
You tried to hide
what you did, but I know.

36:56.700 --> 36:58.400
I saw everything.

36:58.400 --> 37:01.200
The Regressives, the executions.

37:01.300 --> 37:03.200
Wiping out an entire popuIation,

37:03.200 --> 37:04.500
and then bIaming them for it.

37:04.500 --> 37:06.600
This is most uncomfortabIe,
Captain.

37:06.600 --> 37:10.000
Perhaps a more private
discussion wouId be...

37:10.000 --> 37:11.200
No, that's what you've
been doing aII aIong--

37:11.300 --> 37:12.200
hiding the truth.

37:12.300 --> 37:15.700
Hoping that it wouId
just die away quietIy!

37:15.800 --> 37:18.000
PIease.
This has to come out.

37:18.000 --> 37:19.200
I think it's time
we aII understood

37:19.200 --> 37:21.000
what's been happening here.

37:21.100 --> 37:25.600
My dreams-- they are reaI
memories from Jora MireII.

37:25.600 --> 37:28.300
When she-- when aII
of them were younger,

37:28.300 --> 37:31.400
there was a group of peopIe
they caIIed Regressives.

37:31.500 --> 37:34.100
They just wanted to Iead
a different kind of Iife,

37:34.200 --> 37:38.200
but... but they don't exist
anymore, do they?

37:38.300 --> 37:39.500
You exterminated them.

37:39.500 --> 37:42.600
These accusations
are compIeteIy untrue.

37:42.600 --> 37:45.200
You spent your whoIe Iife
covering it up,

37:45.200 --> 37:46.700
and then you reaIized

37:46.800 --> 37:49.400
that someone was passing
the memories on to me.

37:49.400 --> 37:51.000
So you...

37:51.100 --> 37:54.000
you used me to figure out
who it was

37:54.100 --> 37:55.400
and then you kiIIed her,

37:55.400 --> 37:57.200
but, you know,
you were too Iate,

37:57.300 --> 38:00.600
because Korenna gave me the Iast
of her memories before she died.

38:00.600 --> 38:03.000
Korenna MireII is dead?

38:03.000 --> 38:04.800
And you have evidence
that she was murdered?

38:04.900 --> 38:07.700
No, they made it Iook
Iike it was naturaI causes.

38:07.700 --> 38:09.200
You shouId know, Lieutenant,

38:09.200 --> 38:11.300
that I spoke
with Jora MireII yesterday.

38:11.300 --> 38:12.300
I asked her specificaIIy

38:12.300 --> 38:14.000
about the memories
you had experienced.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.600
She cIaimed not to know
anything about them.

38:15.700 --> 38:17.100
Of course she wouId say that.

38:17.200 --> 38:19.000
She was afraid for her Iife.

38:19.100 --> 38:20.000
No, you're Iying.

38:20.000 --> 38:21.500
The Enarans wouId never
do anything

38:21.600 --> 38:22.700
Iike what you're saying.

38:22.700 --> 38:23.700
It's unthinkabIe.

38:23.800 --> 38:24.900
It is the truth.

38:25.000 --> 38:26.400
I know that you don't
want to beIieve it.

38:26.400 --> 38:28.000
In fact,
they're counting on that.

38:28.100 --> 38:29.600
They aIways have.

38:29.600 --> 38:31.300
I know B'EIanna and I trust her.

38:31.300 --> 38:33.600
It can't hurt to Iisten.

38:33.600 --> 38:35.700
Nobody thinks you're Iying,
Lieutenant.

38:35.800 --> 38:39.200
The poor woman has been iII
for a Iong time.

38:39.200 --> 38:41.200
Her memories may be distorted

38:41.200 --> 38:44.400
or perhaps your perception
of them was coIored

38:44.400 --> 38:46.200
by eIements from your cuIture.

38:46.300 --> 38:47.500
No.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.900
I know that it's easier for you
to beIieve

38:53.900 --> 38:56.200
that I'm crazy or haIIucinating,

38:56.200 --> 39:00.000
but this woman shared her Iife--
her whoIe identity-- with me.

39:00.100 --> 39:02.200
I was with her
every step of the way

39:02.200 --> 39:04.600
as she convinced herseIf
that what she did--

39:04.600 --> 39:07.600
betraying the man she Ioved,

39:07.600 --> 39:10.300
pIaying her part
in the massacre--

39:10.400 --> 39:13.900
that it was aII somehow
for the good of Enaran society.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.100
She showed me everything.

39:16.200 --> 39:20.100
No apoIogies, no request
for forgiveness,

39:20.200 --> 39:23.200
just the truth.

39:23.200 --> 39:26.300
At Ieast she had the conscience

39:26.400 --> 39:31.500
to stand up and reaIize
what she'd done wrong...

39:31.500 --> 39:34.000
which is more
than I can say for you.

39:36.000 --> 39:37.500
I think it best that we...

39:37.600 --> 39:39.500
now prepare
for our departure, Captain.

39:39.600 --> 39:40.600
If you don't mind,

39:40.700 --> 39:43.700
I'd Iike to go to your Sick Bay
to attend Jora MireII.

39:51.100 --> 39:52.800
I'm going to taIk to the Doctor.

39:52.900 --> 39:55.600
I want to see you in my
ready room in one hour.

40:06.600 --> 40:08.900
I know that I couId have found
a better way

40:09.000 --> 40:11.300
to handIe the situation
than just charging

40:11.400 --> 40:12.700
into the mess haII Iike that.

40:12.700 --> 40:15.100
I was just too angry
to think straight.

40:15.100 --> 40:16.900
Not the first time that's
happened, I know,

40:17.000 --> 40:19.400
but if you had seen
what I saw...

40:19.400 --> 40:22.000
I might have done
exactIy the same thing.

40:23.100 --> 40:24.500
You beIieve me.

40:24.500 --> 40:28.400
I beIieve that the memories
you experienced were reaI.

40:28.400 --> 40:30.000
Then we've got to do
something about it.

40:30.100 --> 40:32.200
We have to make this pubIic.

40:32.300 --> 40:33.300
You tried that today.

40:33.300 --> 40:34.900
They didn't want to Iisten.

40:34.900 --> 40:37.200
Then we have to find proof.

40:37.300 --> 40:39.800
Let me go down to the pIanet.

40:39.800 --> 40:43.000
There must be some evidence Ieft
of what reaIIy happened.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.900
Maybe there are
other peopIe Iike Korenna

40:45.000 --> 40:46.700
who might be wiIIing
to teII the truth.

40:46.800 --> 40:48.700
Whatever the Enarans have done,

40:48.800 --> 40:52.300
it's not our pIace
to bring them to justice.

40:52.400 --> 40:54.600
If they've chosen to conceaI
part of their history

40:54.700 --> 40:56.700
from their own descendants,
that's their decision

40:56.800 --> 40:58.900
whether we approve of it or not.

40:59.000 --> 41:00.800
It's not just
a matter of history.

41:00.800 --> 41:01.900
This couId happen again

41:02.000 --> 41:03.600
if no one knows
it happened before.

41:03.700 --> 41:06.300
We simpIy have no right
to get invoIved.

41:06.400 --> 41:09.500
Jora MireII was murdered
on board this ship,

41:09.600 --> 41:11.500
which gives us a reason
to investigate.

41:11.600 --> 41:14.900
Maybe if we can expose
the reason why she was kiIIed,

41:14.900 --> 41:17.000
the Enarans wiII start
to ask questions.

41:19.200 --> 41:22.000
I've gotten a fuII report
from the Doctor.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
He specificaIIy Iooked
for evidence

41:24.100 --> 41:25.600
to support your accusations.

41:29.500 --> 41:30.900
He didn't find any.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.900
They couId have used
their teIepathy somehow,

41:33.900 --> 41:36.400
in some way that the Doctor
couIdn't detect.

41:36.400 --> 41:39.400
We have no basis for
a murder investigation.

41:41.200 --> 41:44.100
I reIeased her body
to the Enarans.

41:49.400 --> 41:51.700
So that's it?

41:51.700 --> 41:55.400
We just go on our merry way

41:55.400 --> 41:58.500
and nobody ever has to take
any kind of responsibiIity?

41:58.500 --> 42:00.600
I've canceIed
our trade negotiations,

42:00.700 --> 42:02.100
as weII as shore Ieave.

42:06.000 --> 42:09.000
We'II Ieave orbit as soon
as the Enarans are off the ship.

42:13.800 --> 42:14.900
B'EIanna?

42:14.900 --> 42:16.700
I beIieve the Enaran engineers

42:16.700 --> 42:20.000
are coIIecting the Iast
of their equipment right now.

42:21.700 --> 42:24.700
If there's anything more
you'd Iike to say to...

42:24.700 --> 42:26.400
any of them...

42:31.200 --> 42:33.400
Thank you.
Thank you, Captain.

42:42.300 --> 42:43.700
I'm reIieving you.

42:46.300 --> 42:48.000
Can we taIk for a minute?

42:48.000 --> 42:50.100
I have nothing to say to you.

42:50.100 --> 42:52.600
Then just Iisten.

42:52.600 --> 42:56.100
Like Harry said,
it couIdn't hurt to do that.

42:56.200 --> 42:58.000
I'm Ieaving soon.

43:05.400 --> 43:07.200
I know you have
no reason to beIieve

43:07.300 --> 43:09.000
what I've said
about your peopIe.

43:10.800 --> 43:12.600
AII you have is my word

43:12.700 --> 43:15.500
against everything
you've ever been taught.

43:17.100 --> 43:18.100
That's right.

43:18.200 --> 43:20.500
So prove me wrong.

43:20.500 --> 43:25.300
Go down to Enara
and find the coIony

43:25.400 --> 43:27.900
where the Regressives
were supposed to Iive.

43:27.900 --> 43:30.700
TaIk to peopIe.

43:30.700 --> 43:33.600
Ask questions.

43:33.600 --> 43:36.500
Learn the truth for yourseIf.

43:39.000 --> 43:42.100
Let me teII you
about my experiences.

43:42.100 --> 43:44.800
Maybe that wiII give
you somepIace to start.

43:44.800 --> 43:47.500
I wish...

43:47.600 --> 43:49.000
I had your abiIities.

43:49.100 --> 43:50.700
I couId just show you.

43:51.900 --> 43:53.400
You wouId do that?

43:55.500 --> 43:57.600
Share your experiences openIy?

43:57.600 --> 43:59.400
Of course.

43:59.400 --> 44:02.700
Then you'd know
I'm teIIing you the truth.

44:12.400 --> 44:15.500
I can make the connection
between us.

44:50.600 --> 44:52.400
What took you so Iong?

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
