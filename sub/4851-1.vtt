02:01.012 --> 02:03.765
I don't know why.
I've always been big on happy endings.

02:03.972 --> 02:06.611
To me, the most romantic,
beautiful love stories. . .

02:06.852 --> 02:09.366
. . .were the ones where
two people meet, fall in love. . .

02:09.612 --> 02:12.206
. . .then 50, 60 years later
one of them dies.

02:12.452 --> 02:14.488
A few days after,
the other one dies. . .

02:14.732 --> 02:17.371
. . .because they just can't live
without each other.

02:18.532 --> 02:22.411
Not that that's such a happy ending.
You got two dead people.

02:22.652 --> 02:25.246
That's how I thought things would be
for Katie and me.

02:25.972 --> 02:29.965
Not that we'd be dead,
but that we would be together forever.

02:33.052 --> 02:36.169
Now, High/Low.
Who wants to go first? Erin?

02:36.572 --> 02:40.611
Okay, my high today is that I sat
next to Austin Butler at lunch.

02:40.812 --> 02:42.723
-Nice.
-He has the three-legged dog?

02:42.932 --> 02:46.163
Joel has the three-legged dog.
Austin has the snoring turtle.

02:46.412 --> 02:47.447
And your low?

02:48.372 --> 02:50.522
-Camp.
-What about camp?

02:51.012 --> 02:51.888
I don't know.

02:52.132 --> 02:54.282
You had such a good time last year.

02:54.532 --> 02:56.841
-I know.
-What is it?

02:57.092 --> 02:59.970
Are you afraid you'll lose touch
with Austin?

03:00.652 --> 03:03.007
-I don't know.
-You can write to each other.

03:03.252 --> 03:06.164
You can put X's and O's on there.
Guys love that, right?

03:06.412 --> 03:08.050
Can't get enough of it.

03:08.292 --> 03:09.805
Honey, you'll have a great time.

03:10.052 --> 03:12.327
What about you?
What was your high today?

03:12.572 --> 03:14.767
Gary Ellis' mom bought a new juicer. . .

03:15.012 --> 03:17.082
. . .and I went to his house
and drank a chicken.

03:18.692 --> 03:19.761
And your low?

03:20.172 --> 03:21.207
I don't have a low.

03:21.412 --> 03:22.891
You gotta have a low.

03:23.092 --> 03:26.004
I've been racking my brain.
I do not have a low.

03:26.252 --> 03:28.925
We'll enter the chicken smoothie
in the high and low category.

03:29.172 --> 03:30.161
How about you, Mama?

03:31.372 --> 03:35.001
I know. It's your anniversary.
What are you guys doing tomorrow?

03:35.252 --> 03:38.722
-I'm taking her to a romantic dinner. . .
-Dad's taking me dancing.

03:38.972 --> 03:40.405
. . .and possibly some dancing.

03:40.652 --> 03:42.529
But you're right.
That is our high.

03:42.732 --> 03:44.609
I'd love to stick around
for your low. . .

03:44.812 --> 03:46.564
. . .but Dodgers are playing Giants.

03:46.812 --> 03:47.608
Go.

03:47.812 --> 03:49.370
-Can I go too?
-Go.

03:59.012 --> 04:01.572
I really don't care what we do
tomorrow night.

04:02.932 --> 04:04.684
Even if we're
at different restaurants.

04:04.892 --> 04:09.408
Just as long as the kids see us leaving
together and coming home together.

04:13.372 --> 04:17.047
On our first anniversary,
I gave Ben a plastic spoon.

04:17.291 --> 04:19.964
You know, the takeout kind
from a Chinese restaurant?

04:20.212 --> 04:21.611
It was the one we had used. . .

04:21.851 --> 04:25.162
. . .when we shared our first bowl
of won ton soup in the park.

04:25.572 --> 04:27.210
He was afraid he'd lost it. . .

04:27.452 --> 04:29.408
. . .and I remember how
his face lit up. . .

04:29.652 --> 04:32.928
. . .when he opened the jewelry box
I had wrapped it in.

04:35.372 --> 04:37.488
I keep asking myself:

04:37.732 --> 04:39.723
"When is that moment in a marriage. . .

04:39.972 --> 04:43.169
. . .when a spoon becomes just a spoon?"

05:00.052 --> 05:02.327
When I met Katie,
I wrote on a comedy show...

05:02.572 --> 05:04.767
...and she had been hired as a temp.

05:05.292 --> 05:09.285
I don 't know. It's hard to explain.
There was an instant connection...

05:09.532 --> 05:12.729
... this simpatico.
I felt like she just got me.

05:12.972 --> 05:16.931
And there is no greater feeling
in this world than to feel gotten.

06:16.132 --> 06:18.168
The loudest silences are the ones...

06:18.372 --> 06:20.886
...filled with everything
that's been said...

06:21.132 --> 06:23.521
...said wrong, said 300 times.

06:23.772 --> 06:25.205
You're not hearing me.

06:25.452 --> 06:27.010
You're so goddamn critical!

06:27.252 --> 06:29.322
It's hard with two kids.
I don't need a third.

06:29.532 --> 06:32.763
You're perfect, and I've done
nothing right in 1 5 years!

06:32.972 --> 06:33.961
You're not listening!

06:34.172 --> 06:35.605
You can't let go of anything!

06:35.852 --> 06:36.967
You never listen!

06:37.172 --> 06:38.764
You hold on to everything!

06:38.972 --> 06:40.849
Why should you be responsible
for anything?!

06:41.052 --> 06:43.088
You're critical of every
fucking thing!

06:43.292 --> 06:45.169
I take care of everything here.

06:45.412 --> 06:46.322
-Fine!
-Fine!

06:46.572 --> 06:47.846
-Fine!
-Fine!

06:49.132 --> 06:52.522
Until fighting becomes the condition
rather than the exception.

06:52.772 --> 06:56.526
And suddenly, it turns into
the language of the relationship...

06:56.772 --> 07:01.129
...and your only option is
a silent retreat to neutral corners.

07:06.852 --> 07:08.763
-Okay, are you a person?
-Yes.

07:09.052 --> 07:10.087
Are you a man?

07:10.332 --> 07:12.163
-That's debatable.
-Debatable?

07:12.412 --> 07:14.164
-Do you have a mustache?
-A thick one.

07:14.412 --> 07:15.640
-Aunt Rose.
-Right.

07:16.932 --> 07:18.809
Good old Aunt "5:00 Shadow" Rose.

07:19.052 --> 07:22.089
God, it's almost 9.
We're gonna miss the camp bus.

07:22.372 --> 07:25.125
Now, that is what I call
a mobile home.

07:25.372 --> 07:26.964
Can you get around it?
It's 5 to 9!

07:27.212 --> 07:30.249
-They must change their zip code a lot.
-It happens as we speak.

07:30.492 --> 07:32.960
Look. 91 604. 91 604.

07:33.212 --> 07:34.531
91 605!

07:34.772 --> 07:36.967
-Pass it.
-Their mailman must go crazy.

07:37.212 --> 07:39.123
The kids will miss their bus.

07:39.372 --> 07:42.762
Up on the second floor!
Somebody's about to use the bathroom!

07:43.012 --> 07:44.889
We're in the line of fire!

07:45.132 --> 07:47.885
Would you just pass
the goddamn house?!

07:55.332 --> 07:57.402
Look, the house is making a right.

08:00.292 --> 08:02.965
When I was in college,
we had to write a term paper.

08:03.172 --> 08:06.642
It was for some philosophy course
I was taking. . .

08:06.892 --> 08:09.008
. . .on any book we considered. . .

08:09.252 --> 08:12.608
. . .to be the one that best depicted
how we viewed the world.

08:12.852 --> 08:16.162
I remember some people picking books
by the great thinkers. . .

08:16.412 --> 08:19.961
. . .like Kierkegaard and Plato.
Some kids chose the Bible.

08:20.692 --> 08:23.570
I did my paper on
Harold and the Purple Crayon.

08:24.052 --> 08:26.122
It's a small book
about a little boy. . .

08:26.372 --> 08:29.170
. . .who draws the world
the way he wants it to be. . .

08:29.372 --> 08:31.010
. . .with his magic crayon.

08:31.452 --> 08:34.602
And I just loved that book because. . .

08:34.852 --> 08:37.412
. . .it was about everything
that I wasn't.

08:40.292 --> 08:42.283
You wanna write crossword puzzles?

08:42.532 --> 08:44.568
That's a job somebody wants to do?

08:45.532 --> 08:47.250
And you'd get paid to do this?

08:47.492 --> 08:50.006
So you know stuff like
Ra is the sun god.

08:50.252 --> 08:54.165
And the symbol for radium
and the abbreviation for regular army.

08:54.532 --> 08:56.409
Should I be impressed or terrified?

08:56.652 --> 08:58.483
I find it soothing and reassuring. . .

08:58.732 --> 09:00.927
. . .because you know
there are always answers.

09:01.132 --> 09:03.930
Yeah, but not to the really
big questions like:

09:04.172 --> 09:06.640
"Does God exist?"
"What is the meaning of life?"

09:06.892 --> 09:09.247
"Why does my pee smell funny
when I eat asparagus?"

09:09.492 --> 09:11.687
Aspartic acid, hence the name.

09:14.212 --> 09:15.964
And this soothes you?

09:16.332 --> 09:20.007
Yes, since you'll never find
the answers to the big questions. . .

09:20.212 --> 09:23.682
. . .there's a comfort in finding
the answers to the little ones.

09:24.012 --> 09:25.730
When you finish, there's this. . .

09:26.772 --> 09:28.888
. . .wonderful sense
of closure knowing. . .

09:29.132 --> 09:32.761
. . .that that little world
on that half-page is complete.

09:39.052 --> 09:40.849
You left yourself wide open.

09:43.012 --> 09:44.684
Come to Papa!

09:45.732 --> 09:47.723
But the problem in a marriage is...

09:47.972 --> 09:51.965
. . .if one person is always Harold,
drawing the world the way they want. . .

09:52.212 --> 09:56.603
. . .the other person has no choice
but to draw it the way it is.

09:57.012 --> 10:00.004
Which is why they never wrote a book
about Harold's wife.

10:00.252 --> 10:01.970
-They're leaving!
-They're not!

10:05.852 --> 10:07.205
Grab your bags!

10:08.212 --> 10:09.531
Wait! Wait!

10:10.372 --> 10:11.407
Hold it!

10:11.852 --> 10:13.126
Two more coming!

10:14.252 --> 10:16.766
-Thank you, Marty.
-No problem.

10:17.732 --> 10:20.041
I love you.
Have a great time.

10:20.452 --> 10:21.885
-All right, kid.
-Bye, Dad.

10:22.372 --> 10:24.886
-Take your sister's bag.
-Have a great time.

10:25.132 --> 10:26.406
Love you.

10:33.252 --> 10:35.322
-I love you.
-I love you.

11:23.892 --> 11:27.362
If you need me for anything,
I'll be at the Oceana.

11:28.252 --> 11:30.846
Anything comes up with the kids,
give me a call.

11:31.092 --> 11:32.525
Of course.

11:36.412 --> 11:38.801
Isn't this the moment
where one of us says:

11:39.052 --> 11:41.282
"This is ridiculous.
We love each other.

11:41.532 --> 11:44.524
All couples go through this.
Let's give it another try"?

12:07.012 --> 12:09.048
My ass was on television this morning.

12:10.532 --> 12:11.487
What are you telling us?

12:11.812 --> 12:13.643
I'm telling you
my ass was on TV.

12:13.892 --> 12:15.689
That's right. That was that special.

12:15.932 --> 12:18.810
"The Kennedy Center Salutes
50 Years of Stan's Ass."

12:19.052 --> 12:22.283
I went to the doctor, he took a tube
with a little camera on it. . .

12:22.532 --> 12:26.161
. . .stuck it up my ass and we
watched it on a monitor in his office.

12:26.412 --> 12:28.289
-You had a sigmoidoscopy.
-Exactly.

12:28.532 --> 12:30.762
That's different
than your ass being on TV.

12:31.092 --> 12:32.605
-How?
-First of all. . .

12:32.852 --> 12:34.683
. . .a network can't cancel your ass.

12:34.932 --> 12:36.160
Point well taken.

12:36.412 --> 12:38.801
What demographics
do you hope to knock down. . .

12:39.052 --> 12:41.122
. . .with that big crack
winking at you?

12:41.412 --> 12:44.722
We're in public. Can we
elevate the level of conversation?

12:44.972 --> 12:46.121
-Fine with me.
-Good.

12:46.372 --> 12:48.886
I jerked off to your secretary.
Do you mind?

12:49.132 --> 12:50.724
-Why should I mind?
-I don't know.

12:50.972 --> 12:53.042
I wanna forge ahead
with a clear conscience.

12:53.292 --> 12:54.361
Pound away.

12:54.612 --> 12:55.840
You're a good friend.

12:56.212 --> 13:00.569
Larry wanted to have sex last night.
He even gave me the 30-second massage.

13:00.812 --> 13:04.282
You mean the "I really care
that you had a bad day" back rub. . .

13:04.532 --> 13:06.568
. . .that stops just before you relax. . .

13:06.772 --> 13:09.411
. . .then quickly heads south
towards the promised land?

13:09.732 --> 13:10.960
So did you make love?

13:11.212 --> 13:13.601
-I was too tired.
-How'd you get out of it?

13:13.852 --> 13:16.002
I pretended to fall asleep
during the massage.

13:16.212 --> 13:17.770
I did that heavy breathing thing.

13:18.012 --> 13:19.730
So he thinks you're in deep REM?

13:19.972 --> 13:22.645
But it backfired,
because when I really fell asleep. . .

13:22.892 --> 13:26.282
. . .the baby started crying,
then Larry pretended he was asleep.

13:26.532 --> 13:29.808
Fool! If he had just gotten up
with the baby, you would've. . .

13:30.012 --> 13:33.448
. . .opened the gates and welcomed
the troops home for Christmas.

13:33.692 --> 13:34.966
In a heartbeat.

13:35.212 --> 13:36.884
What's up with you and Charlene?

13:37.092 --> 13:39.128
Oh, we had a great night last night.

13:39.372 --> 13:41.602
And you still claim
you're not cheating?

13:41.852 --> 13:43.968
I maintain that
with every fiber of my being.

13:44.172 --> 13:45.525
On-line sex isn't cheating.

13:45.772 --> 13:46.841
How do you figure?

13:47.092 --> 13:50.050
It's 3 a.m., your wife and kids
are sleeping upstairs. . .

13:50.292 --> 13:53.284
. . .and you're downstairs
fucking some bimbo in cyberspace.

13:53.532 --> 13:56.763
First of all, we're not fucking.
We're typing.

13:57.012 --> 13:59.242
Second, and this is me
taking umbrage. . .

13:59.452 --> 14:01.807
. . .Charlene is not some bimbo.

14:02.012 --> 14:03.764
She's a stockbroker named Ralph. . .

14:03.972 --> 14:06.042
. . .pretending to be some bimbo
named Charlene.

14:06.292 --> 14:08.089
Why piss on something so beautiful?

14:09.012 --> 14:09.922
What'd I say?

14:10.172 --> 14:11.241
It's not an affair.

14:11.452 --> 14:14.046
Teresa never had sex with him.
They just kissed.

14:14.452 --> 14:17.205
-A kiss is an affair.
-You think so?

14:17.412 --> 14:18.322
Absolutely.

14:18.572 --> 14:22.042
Once you establish anything
truly intimate with another person. . .

14:22.292 --> 14:23.805
. . .even talking. . .

14:24.052 --> 14:27.249
. . .it affects the person you're
the most intimate with.

14:27.492 --> 14:30.962
But Teresa could fuck her husband,
she just couldn't kiss him.

14:31.212 --> 14:32.691
I mean, really kiss him.

14:32.932 --> 14:34.047
It's not so crazy.

14:34.292 --> 14:36.760
Sometimes I'm so angry at Stan,
I could fuck him. . .

14:37.012 --> 14:38.843
. . .but I don't want
that cow tongue near me.

14:39.092 --> 14:42.209
A kiss can be so much more
intimate than sex.

14:42.892 --> 14:43.881
Why is that?

14:44.132 --> 14:47.249
Because fucking means,
"Yeah, I love you." But a kiss. . . .

14:47.492 --> 14:49.642
A kiss means, "I like you."

14:50.612 --> 14:52.489
That's so right.

14:52.932 --> 14:57.164
I haven't made out, I mean,
really made out with Larry for years.

14:57.572 --> 14:58.891
Doesn't that make you sad?

14:59.452 --> 15:00.646
Not really.

15:01.852 --> 15:02.762
Why?

15:03.652 --> 15:04.801
I don't know.

15:05.092 --> 15:08.209
Because it's inevitable.
It's the wear and tear of the job.

15:08.452 --> 15:10.647
The diapers, the tantrums,
the homework.

15:10.852 --> 15:13.241
The kingdom, species,
your mom, his mom.

15:13.452 --> 15:16.569
Suddenly, all you're aware of is
the wet towels on the floor. . .

15:16.812 --> 15:19.485
. . .he hogs the remote and
he scratches his back with a fork.

15:19.692 --> 15:23.128
And you come face to face with
the truth that it's impossible. . .

15:23.372 --> 15:25.966
. . .to kiss a person who leaves
the new roll of toilet paper. . .

15:26.172 --> 15:28.163
. . .on top of the empty cardboard roll!

15:28.412 --> 15:31.802
God forbid he takes the two seconds
to actually replace it!

15:32.052 --> 15:34.407
Does he not see it?!

15:35.132 --> 15:38.966
I'm telling you, marriage is
the Jack Kevorkian of romance.

15:41.932 --> 15:43.411
Oh, God!

15:46.652 --> 15:48.165
Jesus! Shit!

15:48.612 --> 15:50.170
-He hit me!
-I didn't!

15:50.372 --> 15:52.806
I was leaving the room,
she stood in my way.

15:53.052 --> 15:55.088
-He did it on purpose.
-Guys, hold on!

15:57.292 --> 15:58.486
Ben? What?!

16:00.132 --> 16:03.363
Katie, you won't believe
what I'm standing in front of.

16:03.612 --> 16:05.762
They're tearing down
our old apartment.

16:06.052 --> 16:07.121
-What?
-See?!

16:07.372 --> 16:08.691
Josh, did you hit her?

16:08.932 --> 16:10.285
She started it!

16:10.532 --> 16:12.727
I told her never to come in my room
without asking.

16:12.932 --> 16:14.763
It's heading for Mrs. Gutierrez's.

16:15.012 --> 16:16.286
There goes her window!

16:16.492 --> 16:18.323
You borrowed her Discman
without asking?!

16:18.572 --> 16:20.483
Yeah, but she was done with it.

16:20.732 --> 16:22.962
She hasn't used the Discman
in two days!

16:24.372 --> 16:27.762
Just hit Jack Roikman's place.
Remember his patriotic orgasms?

16:28.012 --> 16:31.288
"God bless America! God bless America!
Land that I love!"

16:31.532 --> 16:33.124
Can't you let him use yours?

16:33.372 --> 16:35.090
No! He never lets me use it!

16:35.572 --> 16:37.847
Ben, I can't talk right now.

16:38.092 --> 16:41.607
This is where you and I started.
This is where we became an "us."

16:43.252 --> 16:45.812
Just hit where we used to
measure the kids' heights.

16:46.052 --> 16:49.567
Ben, I-- Josh, you shouldn't have
hit your sister. No TV for a week.

16:49.812 --> 16:51.040
You're so unfair!

16:51.292 --> 16:52.441
Wait until I tell Dad!

16:53.932 --> 16:56.400
Jesus Christ! I gotta go!
Are you okay?

17:00.452 --> 17:01.726
Goddamn it!

17:02.972 --> 17:04.564
Fantasizing isn't cheating?

17:04.811 --> 17:07.609
Oh, please! Who is getting hurt?

17:07.852 --> 17:10.412
Yesterday, I met this
stunning blond woman. . .

17:10.652 --> 17:12.882
. . .at the Beverly Center food court.

17:13.132 --> 17:15.771
She had a little ring
in the bellybutton.

17:16.012 --> 17:17.411
But you know what?

17:17.612 --> 17:20.569
I forgave her because
it wasn't in her eyebrow or tongue.

17:20.811 --> 17:22.404
Beautiful. We start chatting. . .

17:22.652 --> 17:25.848
. . .and we strike up a conversation,
waiting for our turkey.

17:26.051 --> 17:28.646
I'm telling you,
she's smiling, I'm smiling. . .

17:28.852 --> 17:30.808
. . .and just that
30-second encounter. . .

17:31.052 --> 17:34.647
. . .will do wonders for me when
I'm shaking hands with the sheriff.

17:34.892 --> 17:36.883
I know exactly what
you're talking about.

17:37.132 --> 17:39.088
-Am I wrong?
-No, you're right!

17:39.332 --> 17:42.290
The other day, I told a joke
to this intriguing woman. . .

17:42.532 --> 17:44.045
. . .that I met at the cleaners.

17:44.292 --> 17:46.852
If this were the '30s,
she'd be a Communist. . .

17:47.092 --> 17:48.969
. . .or at least
a Communist sympathizer.

17:49.212 --> 17:52.409
But the point is, the way
she laughed at that joke. . .

17:52.652 --> 17:55.291
. . .reminded me of how Rachel
used to laugh at my jokes.

17:55.532 --> 17:57.204
You gonna follow up?

17:57.452 --> 17:58.680
I could never do that.

17:58.932 --> 18:02.845
I think the Ten Commandments were
probably a lot easier to stick to. . .

18:03.092 --> 18:04.844
. . .when you dropped dead at 35.

18:05.092 --> 18:07.162
I mean, we--
They should be amended.

18:07.412 --> 18:09.482
A little amendment,
like the Constitution.

18:09.732 --> 18:13.486
"Thou shalt not covet
thy neighbor's house, wife or ass.

18:14.212 --> 18:17.363
But if you have to covet
your neighbor's wife's ass. . .

18:17.612 --> 18:19.523
. . .don't do it
in thy neighbor's house."

18:19.772 --> 18:23.367
A simple amendment, two-thirds
majority, slide through both Houses.

18:23.572 --> 18:27.281
Seriously, name me one guy you know
who's never cheated on his wife.

18:27.532 --> 18:28.851
I wasn't cheating!

18:29.092 --> 18:33.005
I walk into your office,
and I hear you telling some Sara. . .

18:33.252 --> 18:37.564
. . .intimate details about our
relationship, about our problems.

18:37.812 --> 18:40.884
Obviously there's something going on
between you and her.

18:41.132 --> 18:43.885
Nothing is going on between us!
We were just talking!

18:44.092 --> 18:46.003
About us?! About our life?!

18:46.252 --> 18:48.083
We were just talking!

18:48.332 --> 18:50.926
That's not talking!
That's a relationship!

18:51.172 --> 18:54.005
Why didn't you tell me about her
if there's nothing to hide?

18:54.252 --> 18:56.322
I just needed somebody to talk to!

18:56.532 --> 18:59.729
Bullshit! Why didn't you talk to me?!

19:00.052 --> 19:01.644
Mommy, I need a drink of water!

19:02.372 --> 19:03.771
I'll be right there!

19:04.012 --> 19:05.968
You wanna know why
I don't talk to you?

19:06.212 --> 19:09.761
You treat me like I'm a big pain
in the ass that gets in the way. . .

19:10.012 --> 19:13.084
. . .of what otherwise would be
a normal, organized life!

19:13.332 --> 19:16.688
Have you ever thought that
everything isn't always about you?

19:17.252 --> 19:21.404
Maybe I'm tired! Maybe I'm dealing
with 5000 things all day long!

19:21.612 --> 19:24.410
Maybe every need you have
doesn't have to be met. . .

19:24.652 --> 19:27.962
. . .at the exact moment
you need it to be met!

19:28.572 --> 19:30.642
God, we have actual kids here, Ben.

19:30.852 --> 19:32.808
I am not a third child!

19:33.052 --> 19:35.805
I am not talking about having
each of my needs met!

19:36.012 --> 19:37.730
I'm talking about a connection!

19:37.972 --> 19:42.045
A look! Something that says
that we're on the same side here!

19:42.532 --> 19:44.409
Why don't you talk
to your girlfriend?

19:44.652 --> 19:47.769
I'm sure she can help us
get back on the same side.

19:55.452 --> 19:58.808
To have a happy marriage is to accept
the chasm between men and women.

19:59.052 --> 20:00.007
Which is?

20:00.212 --> 20:02.089
He can mend a fight with sex.

20:02.332 --> 20:04.527
She can't have sex
until the fight's resolved.

20:04.972 --> 20:05.882
Why is that?

20:06.132 --> 20:08.566
It's the difference between
the penis and the vagina.

20:08.812 --> 20:12.487
A penis is a thruster,
a battering ram, if you will.

20:12.692 --> 20:15.525
Even if it's mad, it can ram.
Sometimes it even helps.

20:15.732 --> 20:18.246
It's the "mad-ram principle."
However, the vagina. . . .

20:18.492 --> 20:19.607
The vagina!

20:20.852 --> 20:25.403
The vagina has to be relaxed
in order to open and receive.

20:25.692 --> 20:28.160
It can't be a gracious hostess
in a state of anger.

20:28.412 --> 20:30.209
That goes for blowjobs
and kissing too.

20:30.412 --> 20:35.122
Every female point of entry needs
to know that the penis is coming. . .

20:35.492 --> 20:36.720
. . .in peace.

20:36.972 --> 20:39.122
-Do you have Sweet'N Low?
-Is Equal okay?

20:39.372 --> 20:40.441
Whatever.

20:45.492 --> 20:48.609
I've always felt no matter what
we were going through...

20:48.812 --> 20:50.564
...no matter how painful things got...

20:50.772 --> 20:52.967
...if our feet found each other
under the blankets...

20:53.172 --> 20:55.128
...even just the slightest
connection...

20:55.372 --> 20:58.011
...it'd tell us we'd entered
the demilitarized zone...

20:58.252 --> 21:01.881
... that we were gonna be okay,
that we were still an "us."

21:03.652 --> 21:07.406
There are some hurts that you
never completely get over.

21:07.972 --> 21:11.681
And you think that time will diminish
their presence. . .

21:11.932 --> 21:13.968
. . .and to a degree it does. . .

21:14.492 --> 21:16.926
. . .but it still hurts,
because, well. . .

21:18.612 --> 21:20.204
. . .hurt hurts.

21:24.612 --> 21:26.091
If you lose your room key...

21:26.332 --> 21:28.050
...contact the front desk.

21:28.292 --> 21:31.443
And if you've got valuables,
keep them in the hotel safe.

21:31.692 --> 21:33.045
It's complimentary.

21:33.292 --> 21:35.965
For family dining,
how about a pizza poolside...

21:36.212 --> 21:38.328
...from our Wolfgang Puck Café?

21:38.532 --> 21:41.205
Then it's a quick walk to
the Santa Monica Pier and beach.

21:41.452 --> 21:45.525
When the kids are acting up,
the waves will set them straight.

22:00.252 --> 22:02.766
The Patriot is proofpositive...

22:02.972 --> 22:04.928
... that missile defense works.

22:05.132 --> 22:07.441
As we've been taught
by Saddam Hussein....

22:07.692 --> 22:11.765
Something about how that man says
"Saddam" makes me want you even more.

22:23.772 --> 22:25.091
Oh, my God!

22:25.692 --> 22:27.648
-The tooth fairy.
-Where?

22:27.892 --> 22:30.964
Josh's tooth. We forgot to put
money under his pillow.

22:31.252 --> 22:34.210
Josh is asleep. I'm sure
this can wait a few minutes.

22:34.452 --> 22:37.046
No, no, baby, we might forget later.

22:39.412 --> 22:40.970
Who goes?

22:41.612 --> 22:43.125
Rock, paper, scissors!

22:43.372 --> 22:44.521
Shit!

22:47.452 --> 22:51.240
Mr. President, I'm entrusting you
with my soon-to-be-naked wife.

22:51.492 --> 22:53.084
Take care of her, the country.

22:53.852 --> 22:54.921
My love to Barbara.

22:55.252 --> 22:56.810
I'll be right back.

23:05.772 --> 23:07.285
I'll be right back!

23:55.252 --> 23:58.881
Everything that's important in
the world is in this bed right now.

24:02.372 --> 24:03.851
I love you.

24:05.252 --> 24:06.480
I love you.

24:37.532 --> 24:41.161
Hi. You've reached the home
of Jordan, Jordan, Jordan and Jordan.

24:41.412 --> 24:43.084
Nary a Jordan is present now.

24:43.332 --> 24:46.130
If you wanna leave a message
for Katie, Ben, Josh or Erin...

24:46.372 --> 24:48.647
... what better time than....

24:51.412 --> 24:52.891
Hi, it's me.

24:53.132 --> 24:55.771
I'm just calling to see
how the kids are doing.

24:56.052 --> 24:58.282
See if you got any post cards
from them.

24:58.612 --> 25:01.285
Anything comes up,
you can give me a call.

25:02.932 --> 25:04.126
Bye-bye.

25:23.652 --> 25:27.611
Listen, I just got your message.
I was in the shower when you called.

25:28.772 --> 25:30.888
The kids seem to be doing really well.

25:31.132 --> 25:33.441
I just put the post cards
in an envelope.

25:34.172 --> 25:36.481
You should be getting them tomorrow.

25:36.732 --> 25:37.721
Good.

25:40.212 --> 25:41.122
You okay?

25:41.852 --> 25:44.207
Yeah, I'm okay. You okay?

25:44.772 --> 25:46.205
Yeah, I'm okay.

25:53.252 --> 25:54.367
Bye.

25:56.132 --> 25:57.326
Bye.

26:36.732 --> 26:37.767
It's me.

26:42.532 --> 26:43.601
How are you?

26:43.812 --> 26:45.882
I'm good. Yeah, really good.

26:46.132 --> 26:47.121
Good.

26:47.532 --> 26:48.760
What's up?

26:50.252 --> 26:51.241
What's up?

26:54.012 --> 26:58.244
I was thinking about the upstairs
bathroom, and I wanted to remind you. . .

26:58.492 --> 27:00.687
... to schedule that guy
to recaulk the tub.

27:00.932 --> 27:02.843
I've already done it.

27:04.932 --> 27:06.001
Well.

27:06.372 --> 27:07.441
Good.

27:11.492 --> 27:12.971
Then. . .

27:14.332 --> 27:15.208
. . .bye.

27:15.932 --> 27:17.081
Bye.

27:33.012 --> 27:37.164
I'm calling to see if you remember
the name of that tree surgeon we used.

27:37.652 --> 27:38.562
Joey Bishop.

27:39.212 --> 27:40.964
Yeah, but no.

27:41.532 --> 27:43.887
-But it was one of those Rat Pack guys.
-Right.

27:44.092 --> 27:44.968
Frank Sinatra?

27:45.892 --> 27:47.166
Dean Martin?

27:47.492 --> 27:48.607
Sammy Davis Jr.?

27:48.852 --> 27:51.127
That's it! Joey Davis Jr.

27:51.372 --> 27:53.727
Joey Davis Jr., the tree surgeon.

27:53.972 --> 27:56.725
I can still see the sign
on that blue truck of his.

27:57.012 --> 27:59.572
Right. Okay, thanks.

28:02.332 --> 28:03.128
Bye.

28:03.412 --> 28:06.370
Listen, your shirts came back
from the cleaners.

28:08.932 --> 28:11.651
Cool. I'll come by and get them.

28:11.892 --> 28:13.450
I can drop them off.

28:13.692 --> 28:16.365
It's fine. I'll be happy
to come and get them.

28:16.612 --> 28:17.965
What would be a good time?

28:19.092 --> 28:20.320
I don't know. . . .

28:20.572 --> 28:23.370
Why don't you come over tomorrow?
I'll be home by 7.

28:23.612 --> 28:24.931
You can stay for dinner.

28:26.132 --> 28:27.042
You sure?

28:27.652 --> 28:28.926
No.

28:31.412 --> 28:32.811
See you tomorrow.

30:39.772 --> 30:41.000
You look like. . .

30:41.972 --> 30:42.961
. . .like you.

30:45.492 --> 30:46.925
You too.

30:54.212 --> 30:57.841
I guess I could stand on the porch
all night. I've seen the house.

30:58.092 --> 31:02.051
How many times have we said,
"We should use this porch more often"?

31:02.292 --> 31:05.807
Come in. My house is
literally your house.

31:06.052 --> 31:06.848
Thank you.

31:11.612 --> 31:14.888
-There's my dry cleaning.
-Yeah, I left it out for you.

31:15.252 --> 31:17.527
Good. I'll remember
to take it with me.

31:17.772 --> 31:20.286
Because I could put it
in the closet, but I--

31:21.612 --> 31:24.046
That is perfect
dry cleaning placement.

31:25.852 --> 31:27.843
-You want a drink?
-You want something--?

31:29.492 --> 31:30.845
Want some wine?

31:32.052 --> 31:33.963
I think I remember where it is.

31:34.692 --> 31:37.286
-If memory serves, you like red wine.
-Right.

31:37.532 --> 31:39.602
Yeah, it's all coming back to me.

31:42.212 --> 31:44.851
Wine is breathing a lot better
than I am.

31:49.892 --> 31:52.452
You'll never believe
what I did last night.

31:52.692 --> 31:54.967
I attempted to do
one of your crosswords.

31:57.892 --> 31:58.802
I have a question.

31:59.212 --> 32:02.045
What was 3 down?
Just couldn't get it.

32:02.292 --> 32:05.250
Four letters, "Feeling of
psychological discomfort."

32:06.132 --> 32:07.247
Blah.

32:08.532 --> 32:09.806
Blah.

32:12.532 --> 32:13.647
Cheers.

32:14.052 --> 32:15.087
Cheers.

32:26.892 --> 32:28.166
Was this always here?

32:28.412 --> 32:30.562
No, I bought it last week.

32:32.772 --> 32:35.684
Any other new appliances
I should know about?

32:36.372 --> 32:39.045
Well, as long as we're
spilling our guts here. . .

32:39.292 --> 32:41.965
. . .I also got this new garlic press.

32:42.492 --> 32:45.962
The body's not even cold,
and she's out buying garlic presses.

32:57.812 --> 32:59.530
How do you think the kids are?

32:59.892 --> 33:02.201
From the cards,
it sounds like they're good.

33:02.452 --> 33:04.602
I think Erin misses us,
but she's okay.

33:05.332 --> 33:07.084
Yeah. She seems okay.

33:07.612 --> 33:08.681
You think she's okay?

33:09.012 --> 33:10.411
I think she's okay.

33:10.652 --> 33:13.450
Because I think she senses
that we're not okay. . .

33:14.172 --> 33:16.402
. . .and Parents' Weekend is coming.

33:18.612 --> 33:20.648
We'll just have to give her. . .

33:20.892 --> 33:23.167
. . .a lot of extra attention. . .

33:23.412 --> 33:24.765
. . .and really love her up.

33:35.332 --> 33:36.242
Should we eat?

33:36.492 --> 33:38.005
Yeah, I could eat.

33:42.092 --> 33:43.684
This is really good.

33:43.932 --> 33:45.081
Thanks.

33:48.452 --> 33:49.646
High/Low?

33:49.852 --> 33:50.807
Sure.

33:51.732 --> 33:52.528
Your high?

33:53.572 --> 33:54.846
Honestly?

33:56.252 --> 33:57.321
Right now.

33:59.132 --> 34:00.531
And your low?

34:02.612 --> 34:05.001
Every minute of the last two weeks.

34:06.892 --> 34:07.847
How about you?

34:10.052 --> 34:14.443
My high would have to be the Cuisinart,
because I wanted it ever so badly.

34:14.652 --> 34:15.926
And your low?

34:17.012 --> 34:20.721
The garlic press. It's not nearly
as handy as I thought it'd be.

34:21.252 --> 34:24.324
I lay myself open, and you mock me
with kitchenware.

34:24.572 --> 34:27.405
All the while making me
more attractive to you.

34:29.452 --> 34:30.771
Is that your intention?

34:35.692 --> 34:37.205
I'm not sure.

34:40.212 --> 34:41.531
It's working.

35:08.652 --> 35:11.450
It looks like I haven't been
doing too much reading.

35:16.732 --> 35:20.008
Okay, I'm ready. How about you?

35:20.932 --> 35:22.650
-I. . . .
-What?

35:23.732 --> 35:25.848
Come on. Remember
what Dr. Tischner said:

35:26.092 --> 35:29.402
"If you had it once,
you can always get it back."

35:29.852 --> 35:33.765
Was that Dr. Tischner
or was that Dr. Hopkins?

35:35.572 --> 35:37.244
The one with the sibilant "S."

35:37.452 --> 35:38.248
Right.

35:39.732 --> 35:42.121
Wrong. It was a lateral lisp.

35:42.332 --> 35:44.800
Sex is simply a symbolic expression. . .

35:45.052 --> 35:47.771
. . .of the emotional status
of a relationship.

35:48.292 --> 35:53.082
Sustained lack of sex is
symptomatic of disassociation.

35:53.492 --> 35:56.165
No, the one with the lateral lisp
was Dr. Rifkin.

35:56.412 --> 36:00.371
Dr. Hopkins was the one with the
Rorschach birthmark on his forehead.

36:00.612 --> 36:04.082
It looked like California. How could
you pay attention to what he said?

36:04.332 --> 36:07.165
This cycle of closeness,
then estrangement. . .

36:07.372 --> 36:08.805
. . .you've both told me about. . .

36:09.012 --> 36:12.209
. . .what instigates it?
First thing that comes to your mind.

36:12.452 --> 36:14.488
-Sacramento.
-Governor Gray Davis.

36:14.972 --> 36:19.329
My personal favorite was the Freudian
with the prostate problem.

36:20.332 --> 36:21.924
When two people go to bed. . .

36:22.172 --> 36:25.403
. . .there are actually six people
in that bed.

36:26.412 --> 36:27.925
If you'll excuse me.

36:30.412 --> 36:32.448
Are we allowed to talk when he's gone?

36:32.892 --> 36:34.245
I don't know.

36:35.212 --> 36:36.440
What do you think?

36:36.732 --> 36:39.087
To be on the safe side,
maybe we better not.

36:46.692 --> 36:49.252
The six people in bed are
the two of you. . .

36:49.692 --> 36:52.684
. . .and your parents
and your parents.

36:53.412 --> 36:55.972
Now, the key is. . . .

36:56.452 --> 36:58.090
Will you excuse me, please?

37:01.852 --> 37:04.047
He charged us for the full session.

37:04.292 --> 37:06.760
The man was peeing on our time!

37:09.972 --> 37:12.406
All that therapy was
a waste of time and money.

37:12.652 --> 37:15.325
Where did all that therapy
really get us?

37:16.012 --> 37:17.968
It got us here,
laughing about it.

37:18.212 --> 37:21.761
-He's right.
-Once it's broken, it can't be fixed.

37:21.972 --> 37:24.042
-I don't know.
-The queen has spoken.

37:24.292 --> 37:27.250
-Maybe it's too soon.
-What are you talking about?

37:27.492 --> 37:31.690
The whole point of having a fight is
playing "hide the salami" afterwards.

37:32.612 --> 37:35.604
Let hard times bring you together.
Nobody said it'd be easy.

37:35.812 --> 37:39.122
Can't hard times bring us together?
Nobody said it'd be easy.

37:39.332 --> 37:42.051
Like the Andrews Sisters.
After "Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy" . . .

37:42.292 --> 37:44.203
. . .before "Don't Sit
Under the Apple Tree."

37:44.452 --> 37:46.124
Big career slump there.

37:46.372 --> 37:49.045
Like the Andrews Sisters before
"Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree."

37:49.292 --> 37:50.645
The Andrews Sisters?

37:50.892 --> 37:52.769
They didn't stop
because of a few flops.

37:53.012 --> 37:55.048
They hung in there.
The rest is history.

37:55.292 --> 37:57.169
Don 't sit under the apple tree

37:57.612 --> 38:00.445
Why are you bringing up
the Andrews Sisters now?

38:00.692 --> 38:02.648
-You're singing!
-It's an example.

38:02.892 --> 38:04.848
They're in trouble,
and you're singing?

38:05.092 --> 38:08.767
Dot, put out once in a while.
Your face won't be so tight.

38:08.972 --> 38:09.768
Slut.

38:09.972 --> 38:14.250
I don't know what their career slump
has to do with our marital problems.

38:14.492 --> 38:15.845
What should we do?

38:16.092 --> 38:19.368
Make matters worse by dwelling
on every little thing all our lives?

38:19.612 --> 38:22.001
Is that what you think I do?

38:22.212 --> 38:24.487
-You're a child.
-I just dwell on everything?

38:24.732 --> 38:26.848
You're a 72-year-old infant!

38:27.052 --> 38:30.601
There are real problems that we
haven't even begun to deal with.

38:30.852 --> 38:33.810
Don't you think I know that?
What happened to you?

38:34.052 --> 38:36.646
What happened to that fun girl
with the pith helmet?

38:36.892 --> 38:39.884
You don't think I ask myself
that every day?

38:40.132 --> 38:43.408
You beat her out of me!
There's no room here for her!

38:43.652 --> 38:44.971
You think it's all fun and games.

38:45.212 --> 38:48.045
So it's my fault you hang on
to every little thing!

38:48.292 --> 38:50.681
It's my fault you can't
let go of anything!

38:51.612 --> 38:54.080
It's my fault you turned
into your mother?!

38:54.332 --> 38:55.890
Fuck you!

39:40.412 --> 39:44.166
-I still think that there's a chance--
-Ben, you love who we were.

39:44.412 --> 39:47.609
You couldn't possibly love
what we've become.

39:48.612 --> 39:50.682
I think I spotted us
at dinner tonight.

39:52.532 --> 39:55.205
We can't stay together
just because we. . .

39:55.452 --> 39:57.841
. . .get a glimpse of "us"
every once in a while.

39:58.372 --> 40:00.363
It was less than 1 5 minutes ago.

40:02.292 --> 40:05.409
All we proved is, if we're apart
for weeks at a time. . .

40:05.652 --> 40:08.405
. . .we might get through a dinner.
That's not a marriage.

40:14.252 --> 40:15.605
It's over.

40:52.060 --> 40:53.049
A book about your grandmother?

40:53.220 --> 40:55.336
Yeah. She was an extraordinary woman.

40:55.580 --> 40:58.333
I'm sure she was.
Did she fuck a President?

40:59.540 --> 41:02.373
No. Did she discover uranium?

41:02.620 --> 41:04.850
A cure for cancer?
Nothing like that?

41:05.820 --> 41:08.618
Why would anybody wanna read
a book about her?

41:08.980 --> 41:12.256
She was 4'9" . She emigrated
from Europe as a little girl.

41:12.460 --> 41:16.499
She worked in a sweatshop making
buttonholes 1 4 hours a day and yet. . .

41:16.700 --> 41:20.375
. . .raised five kids and stayed married
to the same man for 57 years.

41:20.580 --> 41:23.492
Dave, this will be the greatest
love story ever told.

41:24.940 --> 41:27.898
Let me explain something to you.
Not as your agent.

41:28.100 --> 41:29.818
This is as a friend.

41:34.180 --> 41:35.374
Come here.

41:36.420 --> 41:37.978
You see all these people?

41:38.220 --> 41:41.098
They're getting into buildings.
They're driving cars.

41:41.340 --> 41:44.059
They're crossing the street.
They're walking around.

41:44.460 --> 41:46.610
Every single one of these people. . .

41:46.860 --> 41:48.816
. . .is going to die someday. . .

41:49.020 --> 41:50.419
. . .and they all know it.

41:51.660 --> 41:52.979
Which is why. . .

41:53.660 --> 41:56.936
. . .they regard the time they have
on this planet as precious.

41:57.140 --> 41:59.415
There are things that take up
that time. . .

41:59.660 --> 42:02.572
. . .even if they don't enjoy it.
They have to go to work.

42:02.820 --> 42:05.015
They have to get dressed,
wait in lines. . .

42:05.260 --> 42:07.455
. . .clean yards, get batteries.

42:07.700 --> 42:10.692
They visit the eye doctor.
They're doing all these things.

42:10.940 --> 42:15.616
Now, add that to the time they spend
sleeping and eating. . .

42:15.860 --> 42:18.658
. . .and washing up and voting. . .

42:18.900 --> 42:22.017
. . .and buying gifts for people
they don't like, and you see. . .

42:22.260 --> 42:25.889
. . .why they're so choosy about
how they spend their leisure time.

42:26.140 --> 42:29.212
You can understand why
unless she went down on somebody. . .

42:29.420 --> 42:32.969
. . .really interesting, they won't
waste their valuable time. . .

42:33.180 --> 42:36.456
. . .reading a book about
your fucking grandmother!

42:39.020 --> 42:41.580
So if I read you right,
you don't like the idea.

42:41.980 --> 42:42.935
It's not that.

42:53.380 --> 42:57.055
You know, I find the Ariana
much more fragrant than the Raphaela.

42:58.980 --> 43:00.493
I'll keep that in mind.

43:00.740 --> 43:02.731
-How you doing?
-Fine.

43:02.980 --> 43:06.370
I never got a chance to thank you
for holding the camp bus.

43:06.620 --> 43:09.180
Anytime you need a bus held,
I am your guy.

43:09.420 --> 43:12.173
-Erin's teeth are looking good.
-Thanks to you.

43:12.420 --> 43:14.729
I hope she remembers to wear
her retainer.

43:15.140 --> 43:16.732
You know how kids are at camp.

43:16.980 --> 43:20.495
The minute my Kevin gets off that bus,
it's "Goodbye, biteplate."

43:20.940 --> 43:22.339
Is that for you?

43:23.940 --> 43:27.250
When Deirdre and I divorced,
I decided to learn how to cook.

43:27.540 --> 43:29.531
The Wok-y World of Thai Cooking?

43:29.780 --> 43:30.974
I'm branching out.

43:31.180 --> 43:33.978
I'm taking a Thai cooking course
this summer.

43:34.260 --> 43:37.332
Really? I've always been interested
in Asian cooking.

43:37.580 --> 43:38.649
Really?

43:39.100 --> 43:40.374
Why don't you join me?

43:42.980 --> 43:44.652
When I think about it...

43:44.980 --> 43:47.414
. . .over the years there were
less and less moments. . .

43:47.660 --> 43:49.093
. . .in the course of the day. . .

43:49.340 --> 43:52.059
. . .when Ben and I actually made
real eye contact.

43:52.300 --> 43:54.655
You are not gonna believe
what happened.

43:54.940 --> 43:57.295
-What?
-He's almost asleep.

43:58.700 --> 44:00.656
Maybe it was the stuff of life.

44:01.060 --> 44:02.778
Who 's taking Erin to school?

44:03.380 --> 44:06.213
Who will pick up Josh
from his clarinet lessons?

44:06.900 --> 44:09.209
After a while, there was
a disturbing comfort...

44:09.460 --> 44:11.416
...in not having to deal
with each other...

44:11.660 --> 44:15.175
...because somehow you just
get used to the disconnection.

44:16.140 --> 44:19.974
Even at night, when we could finally
come together, we faced forward.

44:20.180 --> 44:23.092
Yeah, we were tired,
but I think we were afraid...

44:23.340 --> 44:26.491
... that if we faced each other,
there'd be nothing there.

44:26.940 --> 44:28.817
We're learning Mee Krob next week.

44:29.260 --> 44:30.488
Mee Krob.

44:31.820 --> 44:33.412
I'll let you know.

44:37.180 --> 44:39.740
I'll call you. Oh, you call me.

44:44.860 --> 44:47.420
When we drove to the camp
for Parents ' Weekend...

44:47.620 --> 44:49.576
...I was scared to face the kids.

44:50.220 --> 44:54.372
You'd talk about it with a best friend.
But Katie had been my best friend.

44:54.580 --> 44:58.573
Now I didn 't know what we were,
except Josh and Erin 's parents.

45:24.340 --> 45:25.375
What?

45:27.140 --> 45:28.414
Nothing.

45:31.220 --> 45:32.733
--is nothing?

45:34.140 --> 45:36.256
This is not going to be easy.

45:37.700 --> 45:40.612
The kids do not need to be burdened
with our problems.

45:40.860 --> 45:42.498
They have half a summer left.

45:42.740 --> 45:45.413
Like my plan was to burden
the kids with our problems.

45:45.660 --> 45:48.777
Jesus Christ, will you give me
some fucking credit?

45:55.300 --> 45:56.574
I missed you.

45:56.980 --> 45:58.618
I missed you so much.

45:58.860 --> 46:00.418
I missed you both so much.

46:03.580 --> 46:05.252
Dad, pull yourself together.

46:05.620 --> 46:07.611
Dad, get off of me!

46:09.300 --> 46:12.133
You guys both look terrific.
Show us your bunks.

46:12.980 --> 46:14.618
I wanna see your bunks too.

46:14.860 --> 46:17.420
Did you get your favorite room?
The Acorn Cabin?

46:17.660 --> 46:18.979
Yeah, we did.

46:19.220 --> 46:21.256
We got the Acorn Cabin.

47:06.540 --> 47:08.019
God, I hate lying to them.

47:08.260 --> 47:10.854
Me too. We're not even good at it.

47:11.100 --> 47:13.614
Even if we were good at it,
they'd still know.

47:36.380 --> 47:37.574
What is that?

47:38.100 --> 47:38.976
What's what?

47:39.220 --> 47:42.257
-The thing you just put in your mouth.
-It's my biteplate.

47:42.460 --> 47:45.418
-Biteplate?
-Yeah. It's my biteplate.

47:45.660 --> 47:48.299
-Why do you have a biteplate?
-For my bite.

47:49.340 --> 47:50.659
What's wrong with your bite?

47:51.780 --> 47:53.338
It's askew.

47:53.580 --> 47:54.376
Askew?

47:54.580 --> 47:56.172
Yes, it's askew.

47:56.740 --> 47:59.812
So this would be an attempt
to de-skew it?

48:05.100 --> 48:06.818
You order room service?

48:14.180 --> 48:16.250
-What's the matter?
-Nothing. I'm okay.

48:16.500 --> 48:17.774
Honey, are you okay?

48:18.020 --> 48:19.817
I'm okay. I'm fine.

48:20.060 --> 48:23.052
I couldn't sleep, so
I snuck out after lights out.

48:23.540 --> 48:25.815
I just wanted to sleep
with you guys.

48:28.100 --> 48:31.809
It's okay. I'll call the camp
and let them know you're here.

48:36.620 --> 48:38.815
Why is the bed made up on the couch?

48:40.780 --> 48:44.375
Daddy was doing a little reading,
and I didn't wanna wake Mommy up.

49:15.900 --> 49:18.778
Sometimes you just can 't
climb out of the abyss.

49:19.380 --> 49:21.610
I thought of last summer,
when we still hoped...

49:21.860 --> 49:24.613
... that if we put ourselves
in some idyllic setting...

49:24.820 --> 49:27.209
... we'd somehow get rid
of all the tension...

49:27.460 --> 49:28.973
...jump-start our marriage...

49:29.220 --> 49:32.132
...and rediscover why we fell in love
in the first place.

49:32.340 --> 49:34.410
So last year,
after Parents ' Weekend...

49:34.660 --> 49:37.220
... we thought maybe
in a trattoria in Venice...

49:37.460 --> 49:40.816
...looking at a beautiful sunset,
next to a bottle of Chianti...

49:41.020 --> 49:43.659
... we just might find a set
ofjumper cables.

49:45.460 --> 49:48.054
How you doing?
Two Italian ices, please.

49:48.300 --> 49:52.179
Honey, you don't have to say Italian.
We're here. They know.

49:52.540 --> 49:56.215
So if I'm in Belgium, and I order
a Belgian waffle, I just say waffle?

49:56.460 --> 49:59.452
Like if you were in Ireland
and you wanted Irish stew. . .

49:59.700 --> 50:01.133
. . .you'd just say stew.

50:01.380 --> 50:03.769
If you're in China and
you want Chinese food. . .

50:04.020 --> 50:05.692
. . .you say, "Bring on the food."

50:06.780 --> 50:09.772
We couldn't help but overhear
your delightful repartee.

50:10.020 --> 50:12.375
We're the Kirbys from Cleveland.
And you are. . .?

50:12.620 --> 50:14.815
-The Mansons.
-From Spawn Ranch.

50:18.900 --> 50:19.889
That's a good one.

50:35.220 --> 50:37.176
Look, right there.
The red cape.

50:37.420 --> 50:38.614
I like that.

50:44.220 --> 50:45.096
It's you. . .

50:45.340 --> 50:46.170
. . .people.

50:46.420 --> 50:49.378
-The Kirbys from Cleveland.
-Joanie and Eddie.

50:49.620 --> 50:52.737
How could we forget?
We haven't stopped talking about you.

50:53.180 --> 50:56.058
This is fate. We have to
get together, break bread.

50:56.300 --> 50:58.939
Sounds great.
We're at the Hotel Pasta e Fagioli.

51:00.060 --> 51:02.290
You call us.
We're at the Europa Regina.

51:02.540 --> 51:04.690
Great. We'll call you.

51:04.940 --> 51:06.009
Oh, right on!

51:08.540 --> 51:09.416
Look at this.

51:09.660 --> 51:11.378
-This is beautiful.
-This way.

51:11.660 --> 51:13.696
-Thank you.
-Canal-side seating.

51:13.940 --> 51:15.168
Very nice.

51:17.660 --> 51:19.537
Oh, my God!

51:20.500 --> 51:21.899
Meant to be!

51:22.820 --> 51:24.731
Kismet! Kismet!

51:25.140 --> 51:28.849
We went looking for your hotel,
but we couldn't find it anywhere.

51:29.100 --> 51:32.775
-Yeah, it's pretty hard to find.
-Well, all's well that ends well.

51:34.980 --> 51:38.211
It was just like fate,
the first time I met Joanie.

51:38.460 --> 51:41.850
I worked on the 6th floor,
and Eddie worked on the 4th floor.

51:42.100 --> 51:44.295
-Hand to God.
-Every day in the cafeteria. . .

51:44.500 --> 51:46.934
-. . .on the third floor--
-I saw Joanie at the salad bar.

51:47.180 --> 51:49.410
And she smiled at me.
Not just a smile.

51:49.660 --> 51:51.457
I mean, a really big smile.

51:52.260 --> 51:54.820
One day at the salad bar
at Beefsteak Charlie's. . .

51:55.060 --> 51:57.255
. . .I thought I saw her
at that salad bar.

51:57.500 --> 51:59.889
-But it wasn't me.
-It wasn't Joanie!

52:00.740 --> 52:04.574
What are the odds of another person
at a salad bar looking like Joanie. . .

52:04.820 --> 52:06.492
. . .and yet not being Joanie?

52:07.300 --> 52:09.495
What, like a trillion to one?

52:09.740 --> 52:11.412
Could be higher than that.

52:11.660 --> 52:15.539
Anyway, when I realized it wasn't
Joanie, I was so disappointed.

52:15.780 --> 52:19.568
And I began to think about how much
I'd hoped that it was Joanie.

52:19.820 --> 52:22.129
But at this point
you still hadn't met.

52:22.380 --> 52:26.896
No. And I couldn't get over how much
I wanted this person to be Joanie.

52:27.140 --> 52:29.813
And I think that was
the defining moment.

52:30.060 --> 52:33.211
I went back to my wife at the table
at Beefsteak Charlie's. . .

52:33.460 --> 52:37.169
. . .and I realized I felt more alive
thinking about that stranger. . .

52:37.420 --> 52:41.208
. . .I thought was Joanie than I did
with the stranger who was my wife.

52:41.460 --> 52:43.576
We were both in marriages
we'd outgrown.

52:43.820 --> 52:46.573
You know, maybe I didn't
wanna admit it, but maybe. . .

52:46.780 --> 52:50.295
. . .I didn't like myself enough
to be with someone who liked me.

52:50.540 --> 52:53.259
Can you imagine anybody
not liking Eddie Kirby?

52:53.540 --> 52:55.417
I'm not so perfect.

52:55.660 --> 52:57.218
Beg to differ!

52:57.460 --> 53:02.295
That year we both mustered up
enough courage to leave our marriages.

53:02.540 --> 53:04.258
So at this point you had met.

53:05.340 --> 53:06.170
Still hadn't met.

53:07.020 --> 53:10.808
But, you know, after you've had
such a horrible marriage. . .

53:11.060 --> 53:13.813
. . .you don't wanna make
the same mistakes twice.

53:14.060 --> 53:16.369
So I made an inner pact with myself.

53:16.580 --> 53:19.970
I said, "Eddie, you will never
let anger build up to the point. . .

53:20.180 --> 53:22.011
. . .where you don't like
your partner."

53:22.260 --> 53:24.535
-I made the same pact.
-That became our credo.

53:24.780 --> 53:27.248
"Never go to bed angry."

53:27.780 --> 53:29.975
So now we talk everything through.

53:30.220 --> 53:33.656
We won't let even the tiniest pea
be under our mattress.

53:33.900 --> 53:36.130
That's why we never eat in bed.

53:39.780 --> 53:41.452
Me too.

53:44.620 --> 53:46.338
Who 'd have thought the Kirbys...

53:46.540 --> 53:48.815
... the happiest couple
never to have met...

53:49.060 --> 53:51.858
... would be the greatest
aphrodisiac known to man?

54:16.260 --> 54:19.013
If only you could bottle
that unfettered state of mind...

54:19.260 --> 54:21.216
... that comes with being
on foreign soil...

54:21.700 --> 54:23.099
... to just hold on to it...

54:23.340 --> 54:25.774
...even for a day, an evening...

54:26.500 --> 54:27.774
...an hour.

54:28.220 --> 54:31.098
Last year, when we
got back from Italy, God knows...

54:31.300 --> 54:33.097
... we gave it a try.

54:47.420 --> 54:48.773
Hey, look at this.

54:49.340 --> 54:53.379
While we were away, we got a message
from His Holiness, the Dalai Lama.

54:55.020 --> 54:57.090
About a softball team
he's getting started.

54:58.700 --> 55:02.375
You wanna write a letter to the kids
together, let them know we're back?

55:07.580 --> 55:10.253
"Dear Josh. . .

55:10.940 --> 55:12.293
. . .and Erin."

55:12.740 --> 55:15.459
Oh, sure. You get the easy part.

55:18.940 --> 55:19.850
"We're. . .

55:21.180 --> 55:22.329
. . .back."

55:25.540 --> 55:27.132
"From. . .

55:27.980 --> 55:29.049
. . .Europe."

55:30.020 --> 55:32.409
That's not a sentence.
It's a preposition and a continent.

55:32.660 --> 55:34.890
I crossed out your period
and made a sentence.

55:35.140 --> 55:38.052
See? "We're back from Europe."
Your turn.

55:38.300 --> 55:39.210
Thank you.

55:40.100 --> 55:43.854
Exclamation point.
Comma. Close parentheses.

55:44.100 --> 55:46.011
"But I. . .

55:46.660 --> 55:48.571
. . .don't want to talk. . .

55:48.820 --> 55:51.050
. . .about grammar."

55:51.300 --> 55:55.532
Colon. "I want to. . .

55:56.260 --> 55:58.251
. . .make love to. . .

55:58.500 --> 56:00.570
. . .your mother."

56:02.100 --> 56:04.011
No, you didn't write that.

56:06.900 --> 56:09.460
What? I do. I want to.

56:09.700 --> 56:11.418
After we finish the letter.

56:11.620 --> 56:15.533
No, let's make love right now.
Then we write the letter.

56:15.780 --> 56:18.931
Come on, we only had
a couple of sentences to go.

56:19.180 --> 56:22.172
In Europe, you would've
made love first.

56:23.140 --> 56:25.654
-What's that supposed to mean?
-Nothing.

56:25.900 --> 56:28.414
-That I'm not spontaneous?
-I'm not saying that.

56:28.660 --> 56:30.298
But that's what you implied.

56:30.540 --> 56:32.690
That in Europe I'd have
made love, but here--

56:32.940 --> 56:34.976
I don't want us to get to the point. . .

56:35.220 --> 56:38.451
. . .where we can't make love unless
there's a concierge downstairs.

56:38.700 --> 56:43.012
I wanted to take three minutes
to finish a letter to our children. . .

56:43.260 --> 56:44.534
. . .who I haven't seen--

56:44.780 --> 56:48.216
What's that supposed to mean?
That I don't care about our children?

56:48.460 --> 56:50.576
If I finish the letter,
I could be spontaneous.

56:50.780 --> 56:53.578
That's not spontaneous!
That's making an appointment!

56:53.780 --> 56:56.340
I was in the mood
for unscheduled affection. . .

56:56.540 --> 56:58.496
. . .but sorry, we're home. I forgot. . .

56:58.740 --> 57:01.049
. . .everything's gotta be
on a schedule!

57:01.900 --> 57:05.017
You try raising children
where everything's unscheduled. . .

57:05.260 --> 57:07.012
. . .when everything's spontaneous!

57:07.260 --> 57:10.457
You know what? The kids need
a little spontaneity too!

57:10.940 --> 57:12.578
I know that!

57:12.820 --> 57:16.972
I'm sick and tired of being
the designated driver of this marriage!

57:17.220 --> 57:19.939
Nobody designated you!
It's a role you gave yourself!

57:20.180 --> 57:22.216
Bullshit! You gave me that role!

57:22.460 --> 57:26.453
Because God forbid Ben should ever
remember to cancel the newspapers. . .

57:26.700 --> 57:28.292
. . .or put washer fluid in his car. . .

57:28.540 --> 57:31.213
. . .or participate in disciplining
his children. . .

57:31.460 --> 57:34.452
. . .instead of flirting on the phone
with your girlfriend!

57:34.700 --> 57:36.372
You're not bringing that up again!

57:36.580 --> 57:38.775
You're damn straight
I'll bring it up again!

57:39.020 --> 57:40.772
I haven't spoken to her
in six months!

57:41.020 --> 57:43.409
Not once have you seen it
through my eyes!

57:43.660 --> 57:46.732
We don't have a pea under our mattress.
You know what we have?

57:46.980 --> 57:48.049
A fucking watermelon!

57:48.300 --> 57:50.370
And you never wanna deal with it!

57:50.620 --> 57:52.258
Oh, fuck it!

57:52.700 --> 57:54.213
Jesus!

58:01.660 --> 58:03.173
Welcome home.

58:11.020 --> 58:12.294
Bye, Dad.

58:12.780 --> 58:14.532
-Thanks.
-I love you.

58:15.620 --> 58:17.258
-Bye, Mom.
-Buddy.

58:19.380 --> 58:20.608
Love you.

58:21.580 --> 58:23.298
See you guys in a month.

58:29.700 --> 58:31.053
Bye, you guys.

58:31.980 --> 58:33.379
-Bye, Daddy.
-Couple of weeks.

58:33.580 --> 58:35.491
-Watch your toes.
-See you.

58:35.740 --> 58:37.093
Bye, kids.

58:52.340 --> 58:54.649
Do you think we should get
one lawyer or two?

58:59.100 --> 59:00.135
One.

59:01.700 --> 59:04.419
Maybe we can at least
make this part. . . .

59:06.980 --> 59:11.098
All I care about is that we make it
as easy for the kids as possible.

59:15.420 --> 59:19.652
I'm sure you noticed the bathroom has
the original tiling from the '20s.

59:19.940 --> 59:20.770
It's nice.

59:20.980 --> 59:24.177
You know, since you're a writer,
I know you'd appreciate. . .

59:24.420 --> 59:26.809
. . .that the sister
of Bette Davis' chauffeur. . .

59:27.060 --> 59:30.177
. . .once had Thanksgiving
in the apartment next door.

59:30.780 --> 59:31.895
Really?

59:32.900 --> 59:35.130
Are there any other kids
in this building?

59:35.380 --> 59:39.168
Oodles! Including, if I might add,
the nephew of the actor. . .

59:39.380 --> 59:42.611
. . .who jumped third into
the fourth lifeboat on Titanic.

59:42.820 --> 59:45.414
Rent the film, you'll see.
I'll introduce you.

59:45.660 --> 59:49.448
I'm showing it to another family today,
but if you're interested. . .

59:49.700 --> 59:52.578
. . .I can hold it for you,
give your wife a look-see--

59:52.780 --> 59:53.610
I'm interested.

59:53.860 --> 59:57.773
Who wouldn't be? Look how the light
from that window fills the room.

59:58.380 --> 01:00:00.052
When I showed this apartment. . .

01:00:00.260 --> 01:00:02.979
. . .to the man who did the voice
of Charlie the Tuna. . .

01:00:03.220 --> 01:00:06.769
. . .he said, and I quote,
"Wow," unquote.

01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:08.772
I think that says it all.

01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:12.972
First, you put olive oil. . .

01:00:13.220 --> 01:00:14.858
. . .garlic and tofu.

01:00:15.100 --> 01:00:17.534
Sauté until garlic turn light brown.

01:00:17.860 --> 01:00:21.091
Make sure that your wok have
a strong heat underneath it.

01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:24.218
Now take an egg and crack it
to the hot oil.

01:00:26.260 --> 01:00:30.048
Make sure all the ingredients
are cooked thoroughly.

01:00:31.380 --> 01:00:32.290
You okay?

01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:34.576
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:37.570
Now we add some Pad Thai noodle.

01:00:39.380 --> 01:00:42.929
I saw Deirdre up at Parents' Weekend,
but I didn't see you.

01:00:43.180 --> 01:00:44.977
I went up the weekend before.

01:00:45.220 --> 01:00:47.051
You know, since the divorce. . .

01:00:47.300 --> 01:00:50.815
. . .it's a lot easier for everyone
if we come up at separate times.

01:00:51.220 --> 01:00:54.053
Kevin and I took a great hike
up to that waterfall.

01:00:54.300 --> 01:00:55.858
You and Ben take that hike?

01:00:56.100 --> 01:00:58.250
Yeah, it was beautiful.

01:00:58.940 --> 01:01:01.408
Spice it up with some chili pepper.

01:01:01.660 --> 01:01:04.572
You know, spicy food
make a better lover.

01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:06.970
The hotter you eat,
the hotter you get.

01:01:08.380 --> 01:01:10.655
Well, the spicier the better for me.

01:01:12.220 --> 01:01:13.335
Rice vinegar.

01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:18.693
Does Ben like Thai food?

01:01:21.220 --> 01:01:22.778
You and Ben been to Tommy Tang's?

01:01:22.980 --> 01:01:24.299
Ben and I are di--

01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:26.095
Separated.

01:01:27.540 --> 01:01:29.053
Gee, I had no idea.

01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:31.495
We're not really telling people.

01:01:31.740 --> 01:01:33.412
I understand.

01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:36.135
I'm so sorry. How long?

01:01:37.100 --> 01:01:40.934
72 hours, four weeks, five years. . .

01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:43.375
. . .depending on when
you start counting.

01:01:43.620 --> 01:01:46.612
I'm really sorry.
I know how hard it can be.

01:01:49.620 --> 01:01:51.133
This will sound crazy. . .

01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:54.611
. . .but I always enjoyed
Erin and Josh's appointments. . .

01:01:54.860 --> 01:01:57.613
. . .because it gave me a chance
to get to know you.

01:01:58.180 --> 01:02:00.853
But when you called me
about your bite. . .

01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:05.418
. . .I felt myself looking forward to it
because I knew we'd be alone.

01:02:06.660 --> 01:02:09.538
And just tell me if it's too soon. . .

01:02:10.380 --> 01:02:13.611
. . .but I wondered if maybe you
wanted to have dinner sometime?

01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:17.298
We are having dinner.

01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:22.410
I was thinking of something
that didn't involve a teacher.

01:02:25.980 --> 01:02:27.811
You always hear people say...

01:02:28.020 --> 01:02:30.215
... they stayed too long
in a bad marriage.

01:02:30.460 --> 01:02:34.055
For the longest time, I never thought
of my marriage as being bad.

01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:37.815
I thought love was something you
were allowed to fall in and out of.

01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:39.897
You know, peaks and valleys.

01:02:40.420 --> 01:02:42.012
But after a while...

01:02:42.260 --> 01:02:45.297
... the peaks get lower
and further apart.

01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:49.254
Then one day you find yourself
wondering, "Is this who I really am?

01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:52.731
Someone who has taken up permanent
residence in the valley?

01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:56.575
Or is this just who I am
with this person?"

01:02:57.900 --> 01:03:00.334
And then, you ask yourself:

01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:03.970
"Maybe there is another version
of my life, of myself...

01:03:04.220 --> 01:03:06.336
... that's a happier one."

01:03:22.980 --> 01:03:24.299
Bullshit.

01:03:25.940 --> 01:03:28.977
"Yossel looked into Minnie's eyes
and felt. . .

01:03:30.580 --> 01:03:31.774
. . .nothing.

01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:36.139
For two years they'd been apart.

01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:39.611
And now, as she stepped off the boat. . .

01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:42.772
. . .he realized he was
looking into the eyes. . .

01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:45.613
. . .of a stranger.

01:03:47.580 --> 01:03:49.810
A girl he no longer knew.

01:03:50.420 --> 01:03:53.776
He had become an American.

01:03:54.420 --> 01:03:59.016
And she was still the poor. . .

01:04:02.020 --> 01:04:03.931
. . .unaffectionate. . .

01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:06.133
. . .daughter. . .

01:04:07.860 --> 01:04:11.091
. . .of a blind Lithuanian
violin maker."

01:04:12.420 --> 01:04:16.015
It's fear. It was all about fear.
Fear's what kept them together.

01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:19.457
This whole time I've idealized
my grandparents' marriage.

01:04:19.700 --> 01:04:22.168
But this was not the love of the ages.

01:04:22.420 --> 01:04:25.378
The two stayed together
because they were terrified.

01:04:25.620 --> 01:04:28.657
Fear of loneliness, fear of failure,
fear of the unknown.

01:04:28.900 --> 01:04:32.290
Sure, fear. That's the main
motivator for everything.

01:04:32.540 --> 01:04:35.816
That and guilt are the two emotions
that keep a society humming.

01:04:36.060 --> 01:04:38.255
You and Rachel stay together
because of fear?

01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:40.252
-In a word, yes.
-You're okay with that?

01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:42.616
In three words, yes and no.

01:04:43.100 --> 01:04:46.809
See, it's not that simple.
You're looking for clear-cut answers.

01:04:47.060 --> 01:04:50.336
In reality, there's nothing clear-cut.
Life is not clear-cut.

01:04:50.580 --> 01:04:52.457
Life is gray.

01:04:52.700 --> 01:04:54.019
For instance:

01:04:55.740 --> 01:04:57.492
What do you see right here?

01:04:59.380 --> 01:05:02.497
-What are you asking me?
-I'm asking you, what do you see?

01:05:02.740 --> 01:05:04.219
I see your ass.

01:05:04.620 --> 01:05:08.659
That's what you think you see.
But in reality, there is no ass.

01:05:10.260 --> 01:05:12.979
What the f--?
What are you telling me?

01:05:13.180 --> 01:05:17.731
There is no ass, just the fatty part
at the top of each leg. . .

01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:20.255
. . .that is butted up
against each other.

01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:21.979
Hence the word "butt."

01:05:22.220 --> 01:05:23.858
See, essentially. . .

01:05:24.100 --> 01:05:27.615
. . .what we're dealing with here is
just a continuation of the leg.

01:05:27.860 --> 01:05:29.896
Okay, all right, now you lost me.

01:05:30.740 --> 01:05:34.255
It's all illusions.
There is no such thing as an ass.

01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:38.652
Just like there's no such thing as
the perfect marriage, job or child.

01:05:38.900 --> 01:05:42.939
The whole notion of staying together
and living happily ever after. . .

01:05:43.180 --> 01:05:44.499
. . .all illusions.

01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:47.379
You're saying you don't believe
in everlasting love?

01:05:48.540 --> 01:05:52.055
You're seeing the ass again
and not the tops of the legs.

01:05:53.140 --> 01:05:56.416
Love is just lust in disguise.
And lust fades.

01:05:56.660 --> 01:06:00.050
So you damn well better be
with someone who can stand you.

01:06:00.300 --> 01:06:03.849
Katie and I have moved way past
being able to stand each other.

01:06:04.100 --> 01:06:06.056
We've moved right
into the hatred part.

01:06:06.300 --> 01:06:09.019
I wouldn't worry about it.
Hate fades.

01:06:10.020 --> 01:06:11.578
Hate fades?

01:06:13.780 --> 01:06:17.659
That's what you're gonna send me out
into the world with?

01:06:17.900 --> 01:06:21.449
"Hate fades. Love is lust.
There is no ass."

01:06:22.620 --> 01:06:25.293
What a disappointment
you've turned out to be.

01:06:28.180 --> 01:06:29.852
Just promise me one thing.

01:06:30.100 --> 01:06:33.775
Please promise me that you will not
say any of this to Rachel.

01:06:34.020 --> 01:06:36.614
Are you crazy?
This conversation ends here.

01:06:37.100 --> 01:06:39.660
When Stan called me,
I couldn't believe it.

01:06:39.860 --> 01:06:41.816
I knew it was rough for you guys--

01:06:42.060 --> 01:06:44.938
We didn't wanna say until we knew
we weren't getting back together.

01:06:45.180 --> 01:06:46.659
Oh, my God.

01:06:49.300 --> 01:06:50.289
How are you doing?

01:06:50.540 --> 01:06:53.293
I don't know.
I thought I'd be devastated.

01:06:53.540 --> 01:06:55.815
Maybe it just hasn't hit me.

01:06:58.140 --> 01:07:01.450
-You're having an affair.
-What are you talking about?

01:07:01.700 --> 01:07:04.339
You're only not devastated
if you're seeing someone else.

01:07:04.540 --> 01:07:06.098
I'm not seeing someone else.

01:07:06.300 --> 01:07:08.211
Are you serious about
who you're not seeing?

01:07:08.420 --> 01:07:10.695
I don't know.
I know he's nothing like Ben.

01:07:10.940 --> 01:07:13.773
He's responsible, plans ahead,
has a Swiss Army knife.

01:07:14.020 --> 01:07:15.533
He even wants to cook me dinner.

01:07:15.780 --> 01:07:17.259
-He's a sandbag.
-A what?

01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:19.855
He's just a sandbag
against the storm. . .

01:07:20.100 --> 01:07:22.933
. . .holding off the inevitable
devastation.

01:07:25.580 --> 01:07:27.298
Rachel, you okay?

01:07:29.900 --> 01:07:31.128
Honey?

01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:34.819
I'm sorry.

01:07:36.180 --> 01:07:39.490
I know I'm supposed to be the one
holding your hand. . .

01:07:39.740 --> 01:07:41.617
. . .but I just feel terrible.

01:07:42.220 --> 01:07:45.417
I mean, the thought of you guys
not being together. . . .

01:07:45.660 --> 01:07:46.979
You're our best friends.

01:07:47.700 --> 01:07:51.375
Fourth of Julys and Thanksgivings
and Christmases.

01:07:51.980 --> 01:07:54.540
You guys were our
Fred and Ethel Mertz.

01:07:55.020 --> 01:07:57.739
We thought you guys were
our Fred and Ethel Mertz.

01:07:58.860 --> 01:08:00.179
Really?

01:08:00.420 --> 01:08:04.333
I never thought this was
going to happen to me and Ben.

01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:08.050
I thought we were going to be the ones
to go the distance.

01:08:08.300 --> 01:08:12.896
But I just couldn't seem to get him
to put down that purple crayon.

01:08:13.780 --> 01:08:17.613
But that's Ben.
That's who you fell in love with.

01:08:17.859 --> 01:08:20.613
Katie, you are at 80
who you are at 8.

01:08:20.859 --> 01:08:23.294
People don't change!

01:08:23.740 --> 01:08:26.732
People change over time.
You've got to expect that.

01:08:26.979 --> 01:08:31.734
The only way a relationship works is
if people grow and change together.

01:08:32.939 --> 01:08:34.737
Mr. and Mrs. Cogen, Mr. Jordan.

01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:39.093
Nice to have you tonight. Is Mrs.
Jordan not joining us this evening?

01:08:39.340 --> 01:08:43.049
No, she's not. Stan, I told you
to make the reservation for three!

01:08:43.300 --> 01:08:45.450
-I forgot.
-How could you forget that?

01:08:45.700 --> 01:08:48.134
Say it louder. The guy
in the lot didn't hear you.

01:08:48.380 --> 01:08:49.938
It wasn't that loud.

01:08:56.340 --> 01:08:58.456
Did you see Sunday's 7 down?

01:08:58.660 --> 01:09:00.729
-I missed that one.
-Five-letter word.

01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:03.295
"Wants, requirements."

01:09:03.700 --> 01:09:05.372
Rhymes with weeds.

01:09:05.740 --> 01:09:06.649
"Needs"?

01:09:06.899 --> 01:09:09.538
Exactly.
It was a direct attack on me.

01:09:09.779 --> 01:09:11.577
Come on. You're being silly.

01:09:11.779 --> 01:09:13.930
It was just a clue
in a crossword puzzle.

01:09:14.460 --> 01:09:18.247
I know my wife.
She was specifically attacking me.

01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:19.728
And for what?

01:09:20.020 --> 01:09:21.658
For having needs.

01:09:22.380 --> 01:09:24.416
Like having needs is
some terrible thing.

01:09:24.939 --> 01:09:27.818
Show me one person
that doesn't have needs.

01:09:30.260 --> 01:09:33.252
Try this bread dipped in
the olive oil. It's delicious.

01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:34.979
Stan, give Ben the bread!

01:09:35.220 --> 01:09:36.288
Why must you yell?

01:09:36.540 --> 01:09:37.734
-Who yelled?
-You.

01:09:37.939 --> 01:09:38.770
That's not a yell.

01:09:39.020 --> 01:09:41.295
He hears everything as a yell.

01:09:41.540 --> 01:09:43.689
On anyone's yell-o-meter,
that was a yell.

01:09:43.939 --> 01:09:46.010
Was that a yell?
He didn't hear it as a yell.

01:09:46.260 --> 01:09:48.251
His mom was a yeller.
He still hears her.

01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:50.968
How could I hear her?
You drown her out.

01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:52.130
It's true.

01:09:52.380 --> 01:09:54.655
The last few years,
when Katie opened her mouth. . .

01:09:54.900 --> 01:09:56.618
. . .all I'd hear was her mother.

01:09:57.500 --> 01:09:58.489
Dot.

01:09:59.260 --> 01:10:03.651
It wasn't easy for Katie to be raised
by a woman as complicated as Dot.

01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:05.777
Please, she wasn't complicated.

01:10:06.020 --> 01:10:09.615
She was an idiot who made
everyone else's life complicated.

01:10:09.860 --> 01:10:13.091
You wouldn't believe the beautiful
psychological heirlooms. . .

01:10:13.340 --> 01:10:15.331
. . .this snapping turtle handed down.

01:10:15.740 --> 01:10:18.049
Everything's gotta be
in a neat little box. . .

01:10:18.300 --> 01:10:20.575
. . .with a little blue bow on it.

01:10:20.900 --> 01:10:22.128
Punctual.

01:10:22.380 --> 01:10:23.574
Ordered.

01:10:23.820 --> 01:10:26.812
God forbid anything unexpected
should happen. . .

01:10:27.060 --> 01:10:30.211
. . .any perchances, happenstances. . .

01:10:30.460 --> 01:10:33.179
. . .left turns, serendipities!

01:10:33.420 --> 01:10:35.809
Nope, no way! Not allowed!

01:10:36.060 --> 01:10:38.369
Out-of-bounds! Foul ball!

01:10:38.580 --> 01:10:42.493
1 5-yard penalty!
Too much time being spontaneous!

01:10:42.740 --> 01:10:45.732
Everything's gotta be connected.
Gotta connect the dots.

01:10:45.980 --> 01:10:47.936
Maybe that's why they call her Dot.

01:10:48.180 --> 01:10:51.570
You notice that her name wasn't
Gay or Joy or Fun!

01:10:51.820 --> 01:10:53.014
Try the bread--

01:10:53.260 --> 01:10:55.774
You can't even fuck
unless everything's just right!

01:10:56.340 --> 01:11:00.458
Like a plane waiting for takeoff.
Windows shut? Check.

01:11:00.700 --> 01:11:04.136
Doors locked? Check!
Heat on? Check!

01:11:04.380 --> 01:11:07.053
Have we covered every possible,
single reason. . .

01:11:07.300 --> 01:11:08.858
. . .why everything is my fault?!

01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:13.452
Houston, we got a problem
and her name is Dot!

01:11:13.660 --> 01:11:16.458
-Ben, bread.
-There are people like Katie and Dot. . .

01:11:16.700 --> 01:11:19.214
. . .who color inside the lines,
and people like you. . .

01:11:19.460 --> 01:11:22.577
. . .who wander outside.
That can be a very endearing quality.

01:11:22.820 --> 01:11:25.971
That's why Katie fell in love
with you. Once you have kids--

01:11:26.220 --> 01:11:27.858
I am not a third child!

01:11:28.100 --> 01:11:30.694
Excuse me if my watch
has no hands on it.

01:11:30.940 --> 01:11:34.489
That's fine. It's just, somebody
has to establish the routine--

01:11:34.740 --> 01:11:36.935
Are you saying it's all my fault?!

01:11:37.900 --> 01:11:39.333
It's nobody's fault!

01:11:39.580 --> 01:11:42.572
When people say it's nobody's fault,
they don't mean that.

01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:46.130
They mean it's your fault!
The nobody's fault things are. . .

01:11:46.380 --> 01:11:49.816
. . .hurricanes, earthquakes,
tornadoes, acts of God!

01:11:50.060 --> 01:11:53.769
But when a marriage fails,
it's gotta be somebody's fault!

01:11:53.980 --> 01:11:55.174
And it's not mine!

01:11:56.300 --> 01:11:59.656
Take that fucking bread and shove it
up the tops of your legs!

01:12:41.020 --> 01:12:45.093
Maybe I'm tired! Maybe I'm dealing
with 5000 things all day long!

01:12:45.340 --> 01:12:47.808
Maybe every need you have
doesn 't have to be met...

01:12:48.020 --> 01:12:50.215
...at the exact moment
you need it to be met!

01:12:50.420 --> 01:12:54.015
I'm sick and tired of being
the designated driver of this marriage!

01:12:54.260 --> 01:12:57.013
Nobody designated you!
It's a role you gave yourself!

01:12:57.260 --> 01:13:00.058
Not once have you seen it
through my eyes!

01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:03.610
We don 't have a pea under our mattress.
You know what we have?

01:13:03.820 --> 01:13:06.095
A fucking watermelon!

01:13:15.780 --> 01:13:17.099
You okay?

01:13:18.900 --> 01:13:20.652
Take me to Katie's.

01:13:25.340 --> 01:13:26.898
What are you doing here?

01:13:27.500 --> 01:13:29.809
I wanted to know what
your high was today.

01:13:31.580 --> 01:13:33.571
You should've called.

01:13:34.180 --> 01:13:35.932
My high was about you.

01:13:38.900 --> 01:13:41.619
Tonight I saw myself
through your eyes.

01:13:46.420 --> 01:13:47.648
And I'm sorry.

01:13:48.060 --> 01:13:49.573
It might be a nice touch. . .

01:13:49.780 --> 01:13:52.817
. . .if you add some roasted peanuts
to the sesame--

01:13:58.820 --> 01:14:01.812
At some point we should discuss
how to tell the children.

01:14:32.500 --> 01:14:34.456
How you doing? Come on in.

01:14:35.580 --> 01:14:36.899
This is nice.

01:14:37.140 --> 01:14:38.016
Thanks.

01:14:38.260 --> 01:14:41.138
It's close to the park.
The kids and I can walk.

01:14:41.380 --> 01:14:43.371
You want something to drink?

01:14:43.620 --> 01:14:46.339
I'll take water if you don't have
anything else.

01:14:48.900 --> 01:14:50.811
We have pretty much
anything you want.

01:14:51.060 --> 01:14:52.812
Beer, Gatorade. . .

01:14:53.020 --> 01:14:55.136
. . .fruit juice, iced tea.

01:14:55.380 --> 01:14:56.938
Iced tea is fine.

01:15:04.180 --> 01:15:05.010
Here you go.

01:15:05.660 --> 01:15:07.059
You have a watch.

01:15:09.420 --> 01:15:10.694
Come on in.

01:15:12.700 --> 01:15:14.019
Sit down here.

01:15:23.780 --> 01:15:25.657
I think we should. . . .

01:15:27.500 --> 01:15:31.618
When we pick the kids up Thursday,
we should just tell them that night.

01:15:32.700 --> 01:15:35.533
We don't have to tell them right away.

01:15:35.780 --> 01:15:36.849
Why?

01:15:37.220 --> 01:15:39.575
What will change
between now and Thursday?

01:15:41.700 --> 01:15:43.736
Katie, you're seeing someone else.

01:15:43.980 --> 01:15:46.130
I'm not seeing him.

01:15:46.380 --> 01:15:48.177
We're just talking.

01:15:50.020 --> 01:15:51.009
Right.

01:15:54.420 --> 01:15:57.856
I won't put up with any more of this
bullshit lying to the kids.

01:15:58.100 --> 01:16:01.615
We take them to Chow Fun's, their
favorite restaurant, to tell them.

01:16:01.860 --> 01:16:04.454
We can't really talk at Chow Fun's.

01:16:04.700 --> 01:16:06.975
We'll go to the house
and tell them at dinner.

01:16:07.220 --> 01:16:08.130
After dinner.

01:16:08.380 --> 01:16:10.848
We'll all sit down and. . . .

01:16:11.100 --> 01:16:13.534
Jesus, how do we say this?

01:16:16.780 --> 01:16:20.534
We'll just tell them
how much we love them. . .

01:16:21.380 --> 01:16:23.530
. . .how amazing and beautiful
they are. . .

01:16:23.780 --> 01:16:26.738
. . .so they don't think
that any of this is their fault.

01:16:26.980 --> 01:16:28.857
That's the important thing.

01:16:30.380 --> 01:16:32.052
We'll just say that. . .

01:16:32.580 --> 01:16:34.298
. . .Mommy and Daddy. . .

01:16:35.860 --> 01:16:37.930
. . .or Mom and Dad. . . .

01:16:38.660 --> 01:16:39.888
You think Mom and Dad?

01:16:40.140 --> 01:16:41.289
Mommy and Daddy.

01:16:43.340 --> 01:16:45.979
We'll say that Mommy and Daddy
have grown apart.

01:16:46.540 --> 01:16:50.135
I was just thinking about Erin.
She'll probably say something like:

01:16:50.380 --> 01:16:53.929
"Well, there must be something right
about you guys. . .

01:16:54.180 --> 01:16:58.059
. . .for you to produce
such beautiful and amazing kids."

01:17:01.620 --> 01:17:04.180
She might say something like that,
you know?

01:17:12.780 --> 01:17:15.010
We'll just tell her that they were. . .

01:17:16.380 --> 01:17:18.450
. . .born in love and we'll
always love them. . .

01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:21.294
. . .but Mommy and Daddy
don't love each other anymore.

01:17:23.140 --> 01:17:26.928
Well, wouldn't it be better
if we told them. . .

01:17:29.740 --> 01:17:32.937
. . .we still love each other,
but in a different way?

01:17:34.820 --> 01:17:35.889
Fine.

01:17:37.140 --> 01:17:39.700
-We shouldn't say that?
-I said it was fine.

01:17:40.580 --> 01:17:43.333
Well, it was kind of a weird "fine."

01:17:44.580 --> 01:17:48.812
Should I be thrilled about how we
love each other in a different way?

01:17:59.740 --> 01:18:02.300
-Who is it?
-Mr. Jordan, your couch is here.

01:18:02.500 --> 01:18:05.412
Where have you guys been?
Come on in.

01:18:06.900 --> 01:18:09.619
They were supposed to be here
first thing this morning.

01:18:15.700 --> 01:18:18.260
I'll pick you up at 5:00
on Thursday?

01:18:31.900 --> 01:18:33.219
So is there. . .

01:18:34.380 --> 01:18:36.211
. . .anything else
we need to talk about?

01:18:36.660 --> 01:18:37.649
Like what?

01:18:40.860 --> 01:18:41.849
Nothing.

01:18:44.980 --> 01:18:46.015
Bye.

01:19:06.780 --> 01:19:08.054
What happened to you?

01:19:08.300 --> 01:19:11.212
What happened to that fun girl
with the pith helmet?

01:19:11.420 --> 01:19:15.299
You don 't think I ask myself
that every day?

01:19:15.620 --> 01:19:17.258
I'm talking about a connection!

01:19:17.500 --> 01:19:21.618
A look! Something that says
that we're on the same side here!

01:19:22.580 --> 01:19:25.014
Isn 't this the moment
where one of us says:

01:19:25.260 --> 01:19:27.216
"This is ridiculous.
We love each other.

01:19:27.420 --> 01:19:30.457
All couples go through this.
Let's give it another try"?

01:19:43.020 --> 01:19:44.931
It was supposed to rain today.

01:19:46.340 --> 01:19:47.693
Glad it didn't.

01:19:48.900 --> 01:19:50.049
Me too.

01:19:54.380 --> 01:19:56.450
Turn here. If you take Sepulveda. . . .

01:19:59.060 --> 01:19:59.970
What?

01:20:01.300 --> 01:20:02.415
Nothing.

01:20:15.460 --> 01:20:17.815
Do you, Katie, take Ben...

01:20:18.060 --> 01:20:19.857
. . .to have and to hold. . .

01:20:20.100 --> 01:20:22.136
. . .in sickness and in health. . .

01:20:22.380 --> 01:20:24.211
. . .for better or for worse. . .

01:20:24.620 --> 01:20:27.293
-. . .till death do you part?
-I do.

01:20:30.620 --> 01:20:32.338
It's a boy.
It's a girl.

01:20:32.540 --> 01:20:33.370
It's a bunny!

01:20:33.660 --> 01:20:34.888
It's a home run!

01:20:35.140 --> 01:20:36.334
It's chickenpox.

01:20:36.540 --> 01:20:37.370
It's over.

01:20:37.580 --> 01:20:38.774
I love you.

01:20:39.020 --> 01:20:39.850
Damn you!

01:20:40.060 --> 01:20:40.890
I love you.

01:20:41.780 --> 01:20:42.576
Damn it!

01:20:42.820 --> 01:20:43.696
I love you.

01:20:43.940 --> 01:20:45.532
I love you. I love you. I love you.

01:20:45.780 --> 01:20:47.099
I hate you!

01:20:47.340 --> 01:20:49.092
Fuck me. Fuck me.

01:20:49.340 --> 01:20:50.136
Fuck you!

01:20:53.500 --> 01:20:54.569
I love you.

01:20:54.820 --> 01:20:55.696
I'm pregnant.

01:20:55.940 --> 01:20:57.055
My goldfish died.

01:20:57.300 --> 01:20:58.289
My hamster died.

01:20:58.540 --> 01:20:59.336
My father's dying.

01:20:59.580 --> 01:21:00.729
I'm pregnant.

01:21:20.140 --> 01:21:21.971
Maybe we should separate.

01:21:59.980 --> 01:22:01.891
Mom! Dad!

01:22:02.140 --> 01:22:03.368
You ready?

01:22:07.900 --> 01:22:10.175
What's up? It's good to see you.

01:22:10.420 --> 01:22:11.773
How you doing?

01:22:13.060 --> 01:22:14.049
What's the matter?

01:22:14.500 --> 01:22:16.695
She just missed you, that's all.

01:22:16.940 --> 01:22:19.295
You've both just grown so big.

01:22:19.540 --> 01:22:22.008
Look at you guys.
I hardly recognize you. Wait.

01:22:23.020 --> 01:22:24.089
Which one is Erin?

01:22:24.980 --> 01:22:26.459
Check it out, Dad.

01:22:27.020 --> 01:22:30.649
I guess we know what your high
is today. "Best All-Around Camper."

01:22:30.900 --> 01:22:32.299
Congratulations. Look.

01:22:32.540 --> 01:22:35.691
I guess this calls for a celebration!
Come on! Riverdance!

01:22:36.220 --> 01:22:38.654
I'm the best all-around Riverdancer

01:22:38.900 --> 01:22:42.097
Come on. Kind of like
a little "Latin Lupe Lu" thing.

01:22:42.860 --> 01:22:44.339
Go with the big finish!

01:22:44.820 --> 01:22:46.253
Come on! What?

01:22:46.500 --> 01:22:49.776
-I have to see these kids next summer.
-Come on, we're hungry.

01:22:50.420 --> 01:22:52.411
Okay. All right.

01:22:57.900 --> 01:22:58.855
Let's go home.

01:23:11.220 --> 01:23:13.495
I think we should go to Chow Fun's.

01:23:21.620 --> 01:23:23.053
Chow Fun's?

01:23:25.220 --> 01:23:27.780
We agreed that we
couldn't talk at Chow Fun's.

01:23:28.260 --> 01:23:29.488
I know.

01:23:31.260 --> 01:23:32.329
What are you saying?

01:23:32.740 --> 01:23:34.537
I'm saying Chow Fun's.

01:23:38.700 --> 01:23:41.612
Are you saying Chow Fun's
because you can't face telling them?

01:23:41.860 --> 01:23:44.249
If that's why, don't say Chow Fun's.

01:23:44.500 --> 01:23:48.652
That's not why. I'm saying Chow Fun's
because we're an "us."

01:23:49.900 --> 01:23:52.016
There's a history here. . .

01:23:52.260 --> 01:23:54.933
. . .and histories
don't happen overnight.

01:23:55.700 --> 01:23:57.531
In Mesopotamia or ancient Troy. . .

01:23:57.780 --> 01:24:01.455
. . .or somewhere, there are cities
built on top of other cities. . .

01:24:01.700 --> 01:24:04.772
. . .but I don't wanna build
another city. I like this city.

01:24:05.020 --> 01:24:06.658
I know where we keep the Bactine. . .

01:24:06.900 --> 01:24:10.051
. . .and what mood you're in
by which eyebrow is higher.

01:24:10.300 --> 01:24:14.816
You always know that I'm quiet in
the morning and compensate accordingly.

01:24:15.060 --> 01:24:17.620
That's a dance you perfect over time.

01:24:17.860 --> 01:24:20.613
And it's much harder
than I thought it would be. . .

01:24:20.860 --> 01:24:24.899
. . .but there's more good than bad.
And you don't just give up!

01:24:25.140 --> 01:24:27.608
And it's not for the sake
of the children.

01:24:27.820 --> 01:24:29.856
But they're great kids, aren't they?

01:24:30.100 --> 01:24:32.534
And we made them!
I mean, think about that.

01:24:32.780 --> 01:24:35.738
There were no people there,
and then there were people.

01:24:35.980 --> 01:24:37.299
And then they grew.

01:24:37.980 --> 01:24:41.575
I won't be able to say to some
stranger, "Josh has your hands" . . .

01:24:41.820 --> 01:24:45.256
. . .or "Remember how Erin threw up
at the Lincoln Memorial?"

01:24:45.500 --> 01:24:48.253
And I'll try to relax.

01:24:49.380 --> 01:24:53.055
Let's face it, anybody will have
traits that get on your nerves.

01:24:53.300 --> 01:24:57.054
Why shouldn't it be your annoying
traits? I'm no day at the beach.

01:24:57.300 --> 01:25:00.770
But I do have a good sense
of direction, so I can find the beach.

01:25:00.980 --> 01:25:03.255
Which is not a criticism of yours. . .

01:25:04.420 --> 01:25:06.376
. . .it's just a strength of mine.

01:25:06.580 --> 01:25:11.256
God, you're a good friend.
And good friends are hard to find.

01:25:12.420 --> 01:25:14.650
Charlotte said that
in Charlotte's Web.

01:25:14.900 --> 01:25:16.891
I love the way you read that to Erin.

01:25:17.140 --> 01:25:19.973
You take on the voice of Wilbur
with such commitment. . .

01:25:20.220 --> 01:25:21.858
. . .even when you're bone tired.

01:25:22.100 --> 01:25:25.979
That speaks volumes about character.
And ultimately. . .

01:25:26.460 --> 01:25:29.611
. . .isn't that what it comes down to?
What a person's made of?

01:25:30.060 --> 01:25:33.211
Because that girl
in the pith helmet. . .

01:25:33.460 --> 01:25:35.098
. . .is still in here.

01:25:38.220 --> 01:25:41.257
I didn't even know she existed
until I met you.

01:25:41.500 --> 01:25:43.616
And I'm afraid if you leave. . .

01:25:44.420 --> 01:25:46.217
. . .I may never see her again.

01:25:46.460 --> 01:25:50.055
Even though I said you beat her
out of me. Isn't that the paradox?

01:25:50.300 --> 01:25:53.610
Haven't we hit the essential paradox?
Give and take, push and pull.

01:25:53.860 --> 01:25:56.658
The best of times, the worst of times.
Dickens said it best.

01:25:56.900 --> 01:26:00.575
The Jack Sprat of it. He could eat
no fat. His wife could eat no lean.

01:26:00.820 --> 01:26:04.859
But that doesn't apply here, does it?
I guess what I'm trying to say is. . .

01:26:06.300 --> 01:26:08.609
. . .I'm saying Chow Fun's because. . .

01:26:09.260 --> 01:26:10.773
. . .I love you.

01:26:19.700 --> 01:26:20.928
I love you too.

01:26:28.660 --> 01:26:30.218
Did you hear that, kids?

01:26:30.460 --> 01:26:32.974
Your mom wants to go to Chow Fun's!

01:26:33.980 --> 01:26:36.574
Isn't that great?
I love Chow Fun's!

01:26:36.900 --> 01:26:39.255
The egg rolls are good,
but not that good.

01:26:39.500 --> 01:26:41.377
The egg rolls are fantastic!

01:26:41.580 --> 01:26:43.730
They're warm, crispy,
greasy as all hell.

01:26:43.980 --> 01:26:46.494
-Everything you want in an egg roll!
-Exactly!

01:26:46.740 --> 01:26:48.173
High/Low. Erin, you first.

01:26:48.420 --> 01:26:51.253
My high for the summer is,
Austin wrote me 1 1 1 times.

01:26:51.500 --> 01:26:53.730
How did you come up
with High/Low anyway?

01:26:53.980 --> 01:26:56.448
I don 't know.
But I've got another game.

01:26:56.700 --> 01:26:59.294
I'm thinking of seven words.
What are they?

01:26:59.740 --> 01:27:01.298
Do I get a hint?

01:27:01.620 --> 01:27:02.416
A category?

01:27:02.660 --> 01:27:05.618
-Any seven words in English.
-That's right.

01:27:05.860 --> 01:27:07.009
Fair enough.

01:27:07.980 --> 01:27:10.653
"MacArthur Park is melting
in the dark."

01:27:13.900 --> 01:27:16.812
"And they lived happily ever after."

01:27:17.660 --> 01:27:20.128
That's six words,
but you're very close.

01:27:21.380 --> 01:27:24.497
"And they lived mostly happily
ever after"?

01:27:25.260 --> 01:27:26.659
I hope so.

01:27:27.300 --> 01:27:28.813
I think so.

01:27:30.660 --> 01:27:31.809
Think so?

01:27:32.300 --> 01:27:33.449
I do.

01:27:34.780 --> 01:27:35.974
I do. . .

01:27:36.500 --> 01:27:37.569
. . .too.

01:27:44.500 --> 01:27:54.569
