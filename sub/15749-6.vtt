Isn't a tycoon a rain storm?

No, silly, it's a businessman.

about that.

the cause, but not to make a      
spectacle of yourself.

You're too young, anyway. A peaceful
procession is not a spectacle.

No better.

I thought perhaps he'd be up and    
about by now.

Afraid not.              

04:48.840 --> 04:52.636
The thing is, there is a head of    
steam building up about Harry and his
accident.               

04:52.636 --> 04:55.764
The night he crashed the motor, he'd 
been gambling at the club.       

04:55.764 --> 04:57.683
He lost a lot.             

04:57.683 --> 05:01.270
Was he with you?            
I bumped into him there.        

05:01.270 --> 05:03.730
I wish you hadn't introduced him to 
that club.               

05:03.730 --> 05:07.401
Now hold on, if I hadn't showed him  
where to gamble, someone would have. 

05:07.401 --> 05:10.487
Let's say he has a penchant for it.  
He hates to lose.           

05:10.487 --> 05:13.657
That's probably why he was driving  
so fast.                

05:13.657 --> 05:17.411
There's more to it than that. He was 
knocking back the whisky.

Toasting his father.          

05:20.831 --> 05:22.916
And a worse thing...          

05:23.834 --> 05:26.169
There was a lady came to see him at  
the club.               

05:26.169 --> 05:28.297
It could get out.

Can I give you a bit of advice?

If the press get cheeky, you need a  
line and you need to stick to it.   

05:38.849 --> 05:41.310
Tell them he was renegotiating her   
contract.

What if Miss Love gives a different 
story?

11:47.188 --> 11:50.566
lie low and make sure this doesn't   
get left at his door.         

11:53.235 --> 11:55.821
Maybe I want it to be.         
No.                  

11:55.821 --> 11:59.367
Maybe I want the world to know what 
sort of man he is.           

12:11.712 --> 12:13.839
No more news on the Chief?       

12:13.839 --> 12:16.675
Mr Crabb says we've got to think    
positively.              

12:17.635 --> 12:19.762
He's right.              

12:20.763 --> 12:22.681
Victor, I...              

12:22.681 --> 12:24.767
I don't want to fight with you.    

12:25.768 --> 12:27.853
Are we friends?            

12:29.146 --> 12:31.065
Of course we are.           

12:31.065 --> 12:34.360
Do you want to do something after   
work tonight, then?          

12:34.360 --> 12:38.656
We could go to Clerkenwell, meet your
uncle.                 

12:38.656 --> 12:40.783
I can't tonight.            

12:40.783 --> 12:42.868
Maybe another night.          

12:48.249 --> 12:50.626
I've been called to an emergency    
staff meeting.             

12:50.626 --> 12:54.255
My Senior Assistant in Fashion has  
chosen today to be afflicted with   
a cold.                

12:54.255 --> 12:58.259
Please, Miss Towler, would you     
oversee both departments        
while I'm upstairs?          

12:59.343 --> 13:03.222
It's a bit much for me to do both   
departments, Miss Ravillious.     

13:03.222 --> 13:07.810
Perhaps I could oversee Fashion and  
Miss Hawkins could do Accessories?   

13:11.522 --> 13:13.649
Very well.               

13:13.649 --> 13:15.860
We must all pull together today.    

13:23.117 --> 13:24.535
Kitty!                 

13:26.746 --> 13:28.956
Do I have to call you Miss Hawkins  
now?                  

13:30.416 --> 13:32.501
I think it'd be best, don't you?    

13:35.671 --> 13:37.757
MR SELFRIDGE: Oh, yeah...       

13:38.841 --> 13:42.845
His pupils are dilating in response 
to the light,             

13:42.845 --> 13:45.097
which is a good sign.         

13:45.097 --> 13:48.309
And it's encouraging that he's     
making sound.             

13:48.309 --> 13:50.436
But not sense?             

13:50.436 --> 13:52.772
Sense, we must hope, will come     
later.                 

13:57.026 --> 13:59.111
Doctor, his hand, it moved.      

14:05.576 --> 14:07.828
Can you hear me, Mr Selfridge?     

14:15.461 --> 14:17.588
It's a waiting game.          

14:19.924 --> 14:24.678
Mother, Mr Musker is downstairs.    
He's asking to see you.        

14:37.566 --> 14:39.652
Mr Musker.               

14:40.736 --> 14:43.781
I'm so sorry to impose upon you.    
Oh, not at all.            

14:43.781 --> 14:48.452
I came as soon as I heard the news.  
How is he? A little better.      

14:48.452 --> 14:50.496
Thank you.               
Compos mentis?             

14:51.872 --> 14:55.167
No. Not yet.              
I see.                 

14:56.335 --> 14:58.462
My dear Rose,             

14:58.462 --> 15:00.923
I'm sorry to raise this at such a   
difficult time.            

15:00.923 --> 15:04.260
But I do need to clarify something.  

15:04.260 --> 15:06.721
The company lawyer is being somewhat 
cagey                 

15:06.721 --> 15:08.931
about what plan is in place in the   
family                 

15:08.931 --> 15:11.183
in the event that...          

15:12.518 --> 15:14.186
..well...               

15:17.314 --> 15:21.235
Who is going to inherit the family   
shareholdings             

15:21.235 --> 15:23.362
if Harry doesn't pull through?     

15:23.362 --> 15:26.365
I ask this as a major investor.    

15:26.365 --> 15:28.451
I do need to know.           

15:30.286 --> 15:32.413
Well, it would...           

15:32.413 --> 15:35.332
It would be our son, Gordon.      

15:36.500 --> 15:39.420
Harry believes that commerce is a   
man's world.              

15:39.420 --> 15:41.547
Gordon is still a pup!         

15:41.547 --> 15:44.341
I think his shareholdings are placed
in a trust.              

15:44.341 --> 15:50.639
Then Lois and I, we would manage    
them until he came of age.       

15:50.639 --> 15:52.391
Excellent.               

15:53.267 --> 15:58.397
Excellent. Never mind, we could    
always get him a good trainer, if it 
came to it.              

15:58.397 --> 16:00.941
Which I'm sure it won't.        

16:06.781 --> 16:08.908
Would you care for some tea?      

16:08.908 --> 16:10.785
No, no.                

16:10.785 --> 16:12.912
I'll leave you in peace.        

16:12.912 --> 16:15.122
Have you good doctors?         

16:15.122 --> 16:17.291
Er, the best, I believe.        

16:17.291 --> 16:21.462
If you need any help in any way...   
Oh, you're very kind.         

16:21.462 --> 16:25.299
Not at all. You really must let me   
know if there's anything I can do.   

16:25.299 --> 16:27.385
That's so kind of you. Thank you.   

16:28.135 --> 16:31.931
I'm sure Harry will appreciate you  
coming by, Mr Musker.         

16:31.931 --> 16:34.642
We're all doing the best that we    
can.                  

16:37.353 --> 16:40.856
GROVE: Until Mr Selfridge is better,
all decisions will go through me.   

16:40.856 --> 16:43.359
What decisions do you mean exactly, 
Mr Grove?               

16:43.359 --> 16:45.611
The day-to-day running of the store.

16:45.611 --> 16:49.198
Any problems you would normally    
bring to Mr Selfridge...        

16:50.741 --> 16:54.036
Problem number one, we need a new   
window display,            

16:54.036 --> 16:56.163
as the motor is wrecked.        

16:56.163 --> 16:58.249
Do you have any suggestions?      

16:59.792 --> 17:02.545
Not at present.            

17:03.629 --> 17:06.882
Mr Selfridge had a full list of    
appointments...            

17:06.882 --> 17:09.009
(EVERYONE TALKS AT ONCE)        

17:09.009 --> 17:11.220
..Mr Selfridge is recovering while  
at home.                

17:11.220 --> 17:14.306
We don't know it's true. Do we send 
it out? Everybody, please!       

17:14.306 --> 17:17.101
Mr Grove needs to assimilate this   
information.              

17:17.184 --> 17:21.396
He has come in to assume his duties  
under very difficult circumstances.  

17:22.857 --> 17:26.359
Thank you, Miss Mardle. I really am 
most capable. Of course you are.    

17:26.359 --> 17:29.530
But it might be easier if people    
spoke to you one at a time.      

17:31.574 --> 17:33.659
That would be sensible, yes.      

17:34.493 --> 17:38.039
As we are all together, however,    
I think we should discuss this.    

17:38.039 --> 17:41.584
The Suffragettes will be walking    
past the building tomorrow.      

17:41.584 --> 17:44.086
Some other stores are very worried  
about it.               

17:44.086 --> 17:46.547
Ghastly women. Lock 'em up,      
throw away the key.          

17:46.547 --> 17:50.134
That's as maybe, Mr Grove, but we   
need a strategy for tomorrow.     

17:50.134 --> 17:52.762
If Mr Selfridge were here, he would 
have one.               

17:52.762 --> 17:55.264
Well, they're not coming in the    
building.               

17:55.264 --> 17:58.184
Tomorrow is Tuesday.          
Well?                 

17:59.226 --> 18:02.605
The ladies lunch here on a Tuesday.  

18:03.981 --> 18:07.735
They're not to set foot within these
four walls, is that clear?       

18:08.694 --> 18:10.780
Cancel the lunch.           

18:13.824 --> 18:17.161
The procession shouldn't be dominated
by Mrs Pankhurst. I agree.       

18:17.161 --> 18:19.914
The Pankhursts are demanding too    
much centralisation.          

18:19.914 --> 18:23.209
But these inner divisions must not  
weaken the movement.          

18:25.044 --> 18:27.171
Table for three, Lady Loxley.     

18:28.005 --> 18:32.301
If we become weak, our adversaries  
may roughly take advantage of us.   

18:36.514 --> 18:38.599
Why were you late?           

18:41.394 --> 18:43.979
I'm sorry, I didn't get a wink of   
sleep last night.           

18:45.106 --> 18:48.234
I was so cut up about Mr Selfridge. 
He's not dead yet.           

18:48.234 --> 18:50.361
But we soon will be.          

18:50.361 --> 18:54.949
Mr Grove is cancelling the ladies'   
lunch tomorrow. (DRAWS IN BREATH)   

18:54.949 --> 18:58.285
And I'm not going to break the news  
to Lady Loxley. You are.        

19:19.473 --> 19:21.600
Pa's gonna be fine, you know.     

19:24.186 --> 19:26.272
You have his optimism.         

19:28.649 --> 19:30.776
And his eyes.             

19:33.195 --> 19:34.947
Ma...                 

19:34.947 --> 19:38.367
What is it?              
Life is complicated.          

19:42.038 --> 19:44.123
Where was Pa that night, anyway?    

19:45.750 --> 19:49.795
Er, he was with Mr Edwards,      
I believe.               

19:49.795 --> 19:53.215
He's allowed to go out and have fun,
and you're not.            

19:53.215 --> 19:55.342
It's not fair.             

19:57.553 --> 20:01.015
Oh, what a very modern woman      
you are.                

20:05.186 --> 20:07.271
(CAR HORN)               

20:54.235 --> 20:56.320
What a strange little boy.       

21:03.953 --> 21:06.247
Little boys in department stores?   

21:20.803 --> 21:24.598
Sorry, sir. Did he take anything?   
Let me check.             

21:24.598 --> 21:26.434
Stop that boy!             

21:26.434 --> 21:29.061
There he goes!             
WOMAN: Stop that boy! Stop him!    

21:32.523 --> 21:34.608
(GASPS)                

21:38.237 --> 21:41.240
I'm Gordon Selfridge. My father is  
Harry Selfridge.            

21:41.240 --> 21:43.868
Leave the boy alone. He's telling   
the truth.               

21:43.868 --> 21:45.953
Are you all right?           

21:49.040 --> 21:51.167
Ah, Mr Colleano.            

21:52.251 --> 21:54.795
Tomorrow, we'll need the private    
room for 20.              

21:55.880 --> 22:00.551
Tomorrow is going to be difficult,  
Lady Loxley. I hope not.        

22:00.551 --> 22:03.846
I'm entertaining the chairwomen from
19 regional branches.         

22:03.846 --> 22:06.682
There are concerns about the      
demonstration.             

22:06.682 --> 22:11.520
Management thinks that no       
Suffragettes should come into the   
building                

22:11.520 --> 22:14.482
in case things get out of hand.    

22:15.316 --> 22:17.568
I thought this store was        
pro the vote.             

22:17.568 --> 22:19.612
It is.                 

22:20.654 --> 22:23.657
It was. And yet they close their    
doors to us              

22:23.657 --> 22:25.743
at the smallest sign of trouble.    

22:26.827 --> 22:29.747
I'm not staying in such a cowardly  
establishment.             

22:36.796 --> 22:38.005
Madam.                 

22:54.471 --> 22:56.848
Where is Mr Grove's office?      

22:59.976 --> 23:02.562
Roger, don't you think it's too early
to come back?             

23:03.605 --> 23:06.274
There must be a lot to be getting on 
with at home.             

23:06.274 --> 23:08.526
The house is so quiet, I can't be   
there.                 

23:08.526 --> 23:10.654
You don't have to be there alone.   

23:10.654 --> 23:12.739
Not now.                

23:13.615 --> 23:15.700
Not ever.               

23:17.827 --> 23:20.247
I would give this up gladly...     

23:20.247 --> 23:22.165
for you.                
(DOOR OPENS)              

23:28.672 --> 23:31.716
Is it you who's in charge       
when Mr Selfridge is ill?       

23:33.051 --> 23:34.427
It is.                 

23:35.470 --> 23:38.098
You mustn't cancel ladies' lunch    
tomorrow.               

23:38.098 --> 23:41.268
If you do, it will cause grave     
aggravation.              

23:43.061 --> 23:45.313
I have to disagree with you,      
Lady Loxley.              

23:47.399 --> 23:49.609
Allowing these women into the     
building,               

23:49.609 --> 23:51.695
that will cause aggravation.      

23:52.737 --> 23:54.823
I am one of "these women".       

23:56.575 --> 23:58.702
With great respect,          

23:58.702 --> 24:01.162
I believe the fairer sex are not    
equipped                

24:01.162 --> 24:05.041
to understand or take part in the   
rough world of politics. Bunkum!    

24:05.041 --> 24:07.002
Excuse me?               

24:07.752 --> 24:09.838
What do you think, Miss Mardle?    

24:11.423 --> 24:14.509
Violent methods are not the way to   
achieve anything.           

24:14.509 --> 24:17.304
Desperation breeds violence.      

24:18.847 --> 24:21.016
Are you going to reinstate this    
lunch?                 

24:24.144 --> 24:25.645
No.                  

24:26.646 --> 24:30.734
Then I cannot be responsible for the
actions of the militants tomorrow.  

24:32.152 --> 24:34.321
Good day to you.            

24:43.079 --> 24:45.290
Insufferable woman!          

24:45.290 --> 24:47.459
She is a valued client.        

24:47.459 --> 24:51.296
I don't care who she is. She can't  
come in here and tell us how to run 
our own store!             

24:51.296 --> 24:53.381
She could have a point, though.    

24:54.424 --> 24:57.010
I'm trying to think what        
Mr Selfridge would do.         

24:57.010 --> 24:59.971
He'd use this march tomorrow to the 
store's advantage.           

24:59.971 --> 25:01.973
He wouldn't put people's backs up.  

25:01.973 --> 25:05.018
And that is what you think       
I'm doing?               

25:06.311 --> 25:08.647
I just think you should reconsider. 

25:18.531 --> 25:20.617
My decision is final.         

25:49.938 --> 25:52.524
You shouldn't be doing this.      
You're not well enough.        

25:52.524 --> 25:54.651
It's a matinee.            

25:54.651 --> 25:57.487
The punters won't notice if I go on 
half-cocked.              

25:57.487 --> 25:59.614
Take the afternoon off and damn 'em. 

25:59.614 --> 26:02.242
I can't, Frank. It's my bread and   
butter.                

26:04.411 --> 26:07.831
I'm on my own now. I have to think  
about where the money's coming from.

26:10.500 --> 26:12.377
Unless...               

26:12.377 --> 26:14.879
I speak to the papers.         

26:16.923 --> 26:19.009
About me and Harry.          

26:19.801 --> 26:21.970
That would earn me a nice, little   
nest egg.               

26:23.513 --> 26:26.683
Short-term gain, my dear, long-term  
loss.                 

26:26.683 --> 26:30.145
You'd find it hard to tread these   
boards again.             

26:31.438 --> 26:33.940
I'm not sure I care.          

26:33.940 --> 26:36.026
I'm fed up of this place, I tell    
you.                  

26:37.444 --> 26:39.571
You don't need The Gaiety.       

26:39.571 --> 26:42.240
Why don't you try your hand at     
something else?            

26:42.240 --> 26:44.367
Like what?               

26:44.367 --> 26:46.453
Serious acting.            

26:51.958 --> 26:55.086
Could I do it? Of course you could. 
You've got real talent.        

26:56.421 --> 26:58.798
I could introduce you to some     
playwright chaps.           

27:01.301 --> 27:03.428
Oh, Frank!               

27:03.428 --> 27:06.222
Would you? I'd love that.       
I'd be delighted.           

27:07.474 --> 27:09.935
Of course, the highbrow set don't   
like scandal,             

27:09.935 --> 27:12.604
articles in the papers about affairs 
and suchlike.             

27:12.604 --> 27:14.689
It's very off-putting.         

27:17.943 --> 27:21.196
That's the deal, is it?        
That's the deal.            

27:31.081 --> 27:33.166
I'll think about it.          

27:44.344 --> 27:46.429
See? You give it a little tap.     

27:50.642 --> 27:54.646
The telephone at the Selfridge house
seems to be permanently engaged.    

27:54.646 --> 27:56.773
It's probably journalists.       

27:56.773 --> 27:59.442
I know the family.           
I will take him home.         

28:00.568 --> 28:04.155
Miss Towler has made friends with   
him. Perhaps she could accompany us.

28:07.742 --> 28:10.412
There. Wind it back up.        

28:13.331 --> 28:16.084
There you go.             
(CLEARS THROAT)            

28:22.674 --> 28:24.801
What's it like, working for Pa?    

28:24.801 --> 28:27.512
He's fair and he believes in people. 

28:27.512 --> 28:29.598
He is a genius.            

28:30.473 --> 28:32.559
He's the best man in the world.    

28:33.810 --> 28:36.521
But, if he died...           

28:36.521 --> 28:38.607
Oh, he's not going to.         

28:39.774 --> 28:41.860
..I'd have to run the store.      

28:43.153 --> 28:45.280
You'd have help until you got older. 

28:45.280 --> 28:48.658
Your mother, your sisters, your    
grandmother...             

28:48.658 --> 28:50.869
They're girls. They can't do it.    

28:50.869 --> 28:53.788
Commerce is a man's world.       

28:57.876 --> 29:01.880
Where have you been? We've been    
worried sick.             

29:04.007 --> 29:06.092
He was at the store.          

29:08.136 --> 29:11.181
Mr Leclair, thank you so much for   
bringing him back.           

29:11.181 --> 29:14.184
My great pleasure. How is Harry?    

29:16.561 --> 29:19.773
He's...still not himself.       

29:23.026 --> 29:25.737
We're all praying for Mr Selfridge,  
ma'am.                 

29:25.737 --> 29:27.864
We all so want him to get well.    

29:27.864 --> 29:29.950
You're very kind.           

29:33.536 --> 29:34.871
Well...                

29:40.168 --> 29:42.295
You must never run away again.     

29:42.295 --> 29:46.007
Anything could have happened to you.
Do you understand that?        

29:46.007 --> 29:50.512
I wasn't running away. What were you
doing, then, for heaven's sake?    

29:52.055 --> 29:56.726
I was just checking to see if the   
store was all right.          

29:59.479 --> 30:01.564
It's mine if Pa dies.         

30:03.733 --> 30:05.110
What?                 

30:05.110 --> 30:08.822
What do you mean, it's yours?     
Ma, is this true?           

30:10.031 --> 30:13.410
How dare you speak about your father
that way!               

30:14.327 --> 30:16.454
How dare you!             

30:16.454 --> 30:19.708
Go to the library.           
Go on, all of you, go!         

30:24.129 --> 30:26.631
I'm sure Gordon didn't mean to upset
you, dear.               

30:26.631 --> 30:29.217
We were fighting, Lois, Harry and I.

30:29.217 --> 30:31.761
I should have gone after him.     

30:33.597 --> 30:35.682
But I didn't.             

30:36.641 --> 30:39.477
I'm not angry with Gordon, I'm mad  
with myself.              

30:40.645 --> 30:42.731
No, I have to get back.        

30:45.900 --> 30:47.986
You like children?           

30:49.237 --> 30:51.323
Yes, I do.               

30:51.323 --> 30:54.576
You're good with them. Maybe you    
should marry and have babies.     

30:55.535 --> 30:57.662
No, not me.              

30:57.662 --> 30:59.998
I've got too much to do. (LAUGHS)   

31:05.462 --> 31:07.547
Do you have a young man?        

31:08.506 --> 31:10.634
There is someone.           

31:10.634 --> 31:12.761
But he...               

31:12.761 --> 31:15.347
He tells me what's what        
a bit too much.            

31:18.183 --> 31:20.769
What about you? That French girl...  

31:20.769 --> 31:24.022
That French girl is in New York,    
so...                 

31:26.441 --> 31:30.779
Actually, there is someone in     
England I like very much.       

31:34.574 --> 31:36.660
Une ingenue...             

31:38.161 --> 31:41.665
I don't know how to say that in    
English. An innocent?         

31:41.665 --> 31:43.750
Is that the right word?        

31:44.709 --> 31:46.127
Yes.                  

31:46.127 --> 31:47.629
Yes.                  

31:50.882 --> 31:52.926
The thing is, I hope she likes me,  

31:52.926 --> 31:56.554
but if I make an advance, I might   
frighten her away.           

31:58.098 --> 32:00.225
You probably wouldn't.         

32:00.225 --> 32:02.310
You think?               

32:05.730 --> 32:07.857
So, what are you going to do?     

32:07.857 --> 32:09.943
What do you think I should do?     

32:14.281 --> 32:17.158
Maybe wait for her?          

32:19.911 --> 32:21.329
Yeah.                 

32:23.373 --> 32:25.458
I'm good at waiting.          

32:31.756 --> 32:33.842
(APPLAUSE)               

32:35.760 --> 32:38.555
Great show, Ellen.           
Wonderful.               

32:45.770 --> 32:48.815
Well, no more Gaiety.         

32:53.570 --> 32:55.655
All those men in the dark...      

32:57.115 --> 32:59.200
..wanting a piece of you.       

33:01.411 --> 33:03.496
And we know what piece, don't we?   

33:10.629 --> 33:12.714
Time to move on.            

33:54.464 --> 33:56.758
Get out!                
Harry?                 

33:56.758 --> 33:58.927
Get out!                
Harry, can you hear me?        

33:58.927 --> 34:01.972
Get out! Get out!           
Harry, can you hear me?        

34:01.972 --> 34:04.766
Get out! Get out!           

34:21.561 --> 34:23.688
I'm sorry to drag you all into     
this.                 

34:23.688 --> 34:26.400
But we've got a real problem on our 
hands tomorrow.            

34:26.400 --> 34:29.985
Unless we do something about it,    
the store could be in real trouble. 

34:30.862 --> 34:34.574
Are you sure this is a good idea?   
I'm not sure about anything.      

34:34.574 --> 34:37.411
But I have a hunch this is what the 
Chief would do.            

34:37.411 --> 34:40.871
Mr Grove will feel let down.      
Mr Grove is not himself.        

34:42.873 --> 34:45.543
Mr Grove, let me walk home with you. 

34:47.587 --> 34:49.589
Good night, Mr Crabb.         

34:49.589 --> 34:51.675
Good night, Mr Grove.         

34:58.348 --> 35:01.893
Good night, Miss Ravillious.      
Good night, Mr Grove. Miss Mardle.  

35:12.612 --> 35:16.575
You might have heard we've got a    
little demonstration on our doorstep
tomorrow.               

35:16.575 --> 35:19.077
Women getting carried away.      
Nobody's listening.          

35:19.077 --> 35:22.622
You have to fight to be heard.     
The Suffragettes are about progress.

35:23.707 --> 35:26.668
That's why the Chief has endorsed   
their products.            

35:26.668 --> 35:28.795
Emancipated women are the future.   

35:28.795 --> 35:31.465
Like automobiles and aeroplanes.    

35:32.299 --> 35:36.595
It would be a disaster for       
Selfridges to be perceived as     
anti-suffrage.             

35:38.430 --> 35:40.724
We have a plan to avoid trouble.    

35:41.767 --> 35:45.437
But it requires you all putting in  
some extra hours.           

35:45.437 --> 35:48.356
If you want to go home now, that's  
up to you.               

35:49.316 --> 35:53.361
Otherwise let's roll up our sleeves 
and get on with it.          

35:53.361 --> 35:55.447
(APPLAUSE)               

36:01.995 --> 36:03.955
You're not staying?          
I can't.                

36:03.955 --> 36:06.333
I've got a chance for my own      
restaurant, Agnes.           

36:06.333 --> 36:08.418
This person might back me.       

36:08.418 --> 36:10.545
Gosh, that's wonderful. Who is it?   

36:10.545 --> 36:14.925
No-one you'd know. Anyway, I'm     
meeting her...him tonight.       

36:15.842 --> 36:17.928
I've gotta go or I'll be late.     

36:30.065 --> 36:32.192
60 yards of the purple, please.    

36:32.192 --> 36:34.277
Quick as you can.           

36:36.238 --> 36:38.198
You take this one.           

36:38.198 --> 36:41.910
And those two. You leave the blue   
one. Right in the window, please.   

36:41.910 --> 36:43.787
(SIGHS)                

36:43.787 --> 36:46.248
How are we doing?           
We're gonna be good.          

36:46.248 --> 36:47.374
Yes.                  

36:53.213 --> 36:55.799
That's all right, ladies. We need to
fold it now.              

36:56.883 --> 36:58.969
Let me help you with that.       

37:15.694 --> 37:17.446
Voila.                 

37:20.907 --> 37:22.993
(TRAIN HORN)              

37:28.915 --> 37:31.752
I'd ask you in, but it doesn't seem 
right somehow.             

37:32.627 --> 37:36.381
I know she's dead, but I must still 
respect her.              

37:36.381 --> 37:38.467
I understand.             

37:40.385 --> 37:42.471
Good night, Josie.           

37:44.556 --> 37:46.349
Roger...                

37:47.976 --> 37:50.145
You cared for Hettie for 12 years.   

37:51.855 --> 37:53.940
You mustn't feel guilty.        

37:54.941 --> 37:57.069
This is your time.           

37:57.069 --> 37:58.570
Now.                  

38:00.155 --> 38:02.240
You deserve it.            

38:24.471 --> 38:26.556
(SOBS)                 

38:43.782 --> 38:47.119
Mr Selfridge would have loved this  
challenge,               

38:47.119 --> 38:49.204
and that we rose to it.        

38:50.205 --> 38:52.833
He believes every man can be better 
than he is.              

38:52.833 --> 38:54.918
What about every woman, Mr Crabb?   

38:56.044 --> 38:58.171
Yes, um, women, too.          

38:58.171 --> 39:01.466
Thank you, everyone. Sleep well.    

39:01.466 --> 39:03.552
And see you all tomorrow.       

39:09.850 --> 39:11.935

Good morning, Mr Selfridge. I need  
to check your pulse.          

40:14.122 --> 40:17.042
You've had a bump to the head.     

40:17.042 --> 40:20.379
You crashed your automobile, Pa.    
I did?

I don't remember.           

40:23.507 --> 40:26.009
May I ask you a few questions?     

40:27.052 --> 40:28.220
Yes.                  

40:28.220 --> 40:30.305
Who are these people in the room?   

40:32.682 --> 40:34.810
My family, of course. My wife,

40:36.978 --> 40:39.398

Still sleeping.

I gotta go to the store.

No...                 
That is out of the question.
