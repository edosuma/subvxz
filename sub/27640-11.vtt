WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:02.000
(Bird caws, dog barks)

00:02.070 --> 00:04.105
Okay so, as we all know,

00:04.206 --> 00:05.906
I think surprise parties are tacky,

00:06.007 --> 00:08.542
and far too often organized
by well-intentioned people

00:08.643 --> 00:09.910
with very bad taste.

00:10.011 --> 00:13.180
But... Patrick has always wanted one,

00:13.281 --> 00:14.415
poor thing.

00:14.516 --> 00:18.185
So I am throwing him a
surprise party... tonight.

00:18.286 --> 00:20.264
Johnny: Well David, these
kinds of parties take time,

00:20.296 --> 00:21.798
and... planning.

00:21.823 --> 00:24.191
Now, when I planned that
Casablanca-themed party

00:24.216 --> 00:25.635
for your mother's 40th,

00:25.660 --> 00:27.971
I had to quarantine
the camels for a month.

00:27.996 --> 00:29.463
- Mhmm.
- Yeah David,

00:29.488 --> 00:31.556
this is all feeling very
sketchy and last minute-y.

00:31.581 --> 00:34.077
I've actually been organizing
this for quite some time,

00:34.102 --> 00:35.903
I'm just telling you right now

00:35.928 --> 00:38.129
because I know that none
of you can keep a secret.

00:38.154 --> 00:40.217
Oh! At 9 a.m. it's a little early

00:40.242 --> 00:42.309
for character assassination.

00:42.410 --> 00:44.988
Not one of you knows how
the "Crows" movie ends.

00:45.013 --> 00:46.914
You told me the day you got home.

00:46.939 --> 00:48.773
You gave me the script.

00:48.798 --> 00:50.328
And you were both sworn to secrecy,

00:50.352 --> 00:52.720
so David is right not to trust you.

00:52.821 --> 00:54.698
Yeah, this is why I'm
reluctant to tell you

00:54.723 --> 00:58.523
that there is an extra surprise tonight.

00:59.590 --> 01:01.691
I invited Patrick's parents.

01:01.716 --> 01:03.264
Oh my God, David!

01:03.289 --> 01:07.320
Oh, that is very exciting news, son!

01:07.345 --> 01:08.912
Meeting the parents!

01:08.937 --> 01:10.504
That's a big step.

01:10.529 --> 01:12.749
Yes, things are certainly racing along

01:12.774 --> 01:15.743
at a dangerously rapid velocity.

01:15.768 --> 01:17.045
Thank you so much, we're doing great.

01:17.070 --> 01:20.257
Now, I will only be
throwing one surprise party,

01:20.282 --> 01:21.749
and one surprise party only.

01:21.774 --> 01:23.927
So tonight there will be a surprise.

01:23.952 --> 01:25.252
And there will be tears.

01:25.277 --> 01:27.867
Even if they're just my own. Okay?

01:28.399 --> 01:31.601
How did it end again?
Like, a crowmageddon?

01:31.626 --> 01:32.927
Crowpocalypse.

01:32.952 --> 01:35.851
- But you didn't hear it from me.
- (Snickers)

01:36.066 --> 01:37.767
- So...
- Wow.

01:37.899 --> 01:42.757
-- Synced and corrected by ChrisKe --

01:43.305 --> 01:45.172
This is a really big deal, Johnny.

01:45.197 --> 01:47.384
I mean, meeting my best friend's son's

01:47.409 --> 01:50.420
boyfriend's parents
for the very first time,

01:50.445 --> 01:51.946
I am very touched that you wanted me

01:51.971 --> 01:53.438
to share this moment with you.

01:53.523 --> 01:55.659
I asked you to mow the
lawn three times, Roland,

01:55.684 --> 01:58.552
So you being here is more
your decision than mine.

01:58.577 --> 02:00.044
(Door latch clicks)

02:00.069 --> 02:01.522
- Oh! Clint... Hello.

02:01.547 --> 02:03.214
Oh, hi!

02:03.391 --> 02:05.759
- Hi.
- You must be the Brewers.

02:05.784 --> 02:08.685
I'm Clint. This is my wife, Marci.

02:08.710 --> 02:11.344
What a special moment
this is for all of us, huh?

02:11.369 --> 02:13.910
- (Chuckles)
- You must be David's Dad.

02:13.935 --> 02:17.004
Oh, no, no! I do get
that all the time, though.

02:17.105 --> 02:19.740
It's uh, you know, you've got
David's handsome looks there,

02:19.765 --> 02:20.832
and then my face.

02:20.857 --> 02:22.958
Yeah, I'm David's father, Johnny Rose.

02:22.983 --> 02:24.843
Johnny, it's a pleasure to meet you.

02:24.880 --> 02:26.013
- Yes, hi.
- Hi.

02:26.038 --> 02:27.772
Now, Patrick tells me you run the motel.

02:27.797 --> 02:29.550
More like, runs it into the ground.

02:29.575 --> 02:32.143
(Laughs uproariously)

02:32.320 --> 02:34.288
Oh, we do have a lot of
fun around here, don't we?

02:34.313 --> 02:35.747
We do, sometimes.

02:35.772 --> 02:37.650
Roland, do you want to
get the room key for them?

02:37.675 --> 02:38.675
Sure.

02:38.700 --> 02:40.895
So this is all very exciting.

02:40.920 --> 02:42.387
I assume we'll see you tonight?

02:42.412 --> 02:45.114
Oh you definitely will.

02:45.139 --> 02:46.828
So Patrick has been
keeping us up to date

02:46.853 --> 02:49.145
about everything he and
David have been doing,

02:49.170 --> 02:51.953
and I think it's amazing
how far they've come.

02:51.978 --> 02:53.941
Yes, yes, yes it is.

02:53.966 --> 02:55.952
But uh, I'll have to admit,

02:55.977 --> 02:59.213
I've been somewhat of a
skeptic about those two.

02:59.238 --> 03:01.573
This one isn't as
progressive as the rest of us.

03:01.598 --> 03:03.326
It's a generational thing with him.

03:03.351 --> 03:05.753
I was talking about the store, Roland.

03:05.778 --> 03:07.679
You know, mixing a business relationship

03:07.704 --> 03:10.691
and a romantic
relationship, well, that's...

03:10.716 --> 03:12.684
it can get kinda tricky sometimes.

03:15.820 --> 03:17.598
I-I-I missed
the last part

03:17.623 --> 03:19.679
of what you just said. The uh...

03:19.704 --> 03:22.303
Oh, well, you were aware
they were in business

03:22.328 --> 03:25.063
together as well, right?

03:25.088 --> 03:27.322
We knew that part, yes.

03:27.347 --> 03:31.578
Really? Because it kind of
seems like the two of you

03:31.603 --> 03:34.953
just found out some really
shocking information.

03:35.189 --> 03:37.924
Did I... speak out of turn?

03:38.250 --> 03:39.920
I-I think we'll just go to the room,

03:39.945 --> 03:42.547
and get ready for the
big surprise tonight.

03:42.572 --> 03:44.109
Oh, sure.

03:46.006 --> 03:47.473
(Door latch clicks)

03:50.565 --> 03:51.665
(Door slams)

03:51.937 --> 03:54.969
Huh. Correct me if
I'm wrong here, Johnny.

03:54.994 --> 03:57.180
But it kinda seems like they didn't know

03:57.205 --> 03:59.796
their son is in a
relationship with David.

04:04.054 --> 04:06.347
(Gasps) You're looking especially fresh

04:06.372 --> 04:08.373
and photogenic today, Mother.

04:08.398 --> 04:09.832
Why thank you, Alexis.

04:09.857 --> 04:11.742
Perhaps it's my excellent news.

04:11.767 --> 04:13.854
I found a very promising revenue stream

04:13.879 --> 04:16.166
to help finance the little
deficit we've accrued

04:16.190 --> 04:18.358
- on "Cabaret".
- What might that be?

04:18.384 --> 04:20.051
Well, according to the radio,

04:20.228 --> 04:23.364
there's a darling little
medical clinic in Elm Grove.

04:23.389 --> 04:26.224
Where if any one of us,
say, you, or your father,

04:26.249 --> 04:29.476
participates in a few nugatory tests,

04:29.501 --> 04:32.983
we could be bringing
in over $200 a week!

04:33.008 --> 04:34.174
(Gasps)

04:34.199 --> 04:38.788
Or, you could make
$2,000 in one afternoon.

04:38.813 --> 04:40.481
Ugh, which test is this?

04:40.506 --> 04:42.792
I'm talking about the
soap opera fan convention

04:42.817 --> 04:44.284
that's happening today.

04:44.309 --> 04:45.695
I looked at your calendar,

04:45.720 --> 04:47.321
so I know that you have the day off.

04:47.346 --> 04:49.047
Working from home.

04:49.072 --> 04:51.759
I already purchased a booth.
Your name is on the website,

04:51.784 --> 04:53.461
and I just printed out
all of these headshots

04:53.486 --> 04:54.787
for you to sign.

04:54.963 --> 04:56.864
Obviously I will be taking commission.

04:56.889 --> 04:58.608
Alexis, there's a good reason

04:58.633 --> 05:00.934
I've avoided these
conventions in the past.

05:00.959 --> 05:03.026
Showing up, taking
your picture with a...

05:03.051 --> 05:06.803
motley crew of pale,
dewy-faced salamander people.

05:06.828 --> 05:09.319
I haven't hit rock bottom quite yet.

05:09.420 --> 05:11.421
It's a matter of self-worth.

05:11.446 --> 05:13.847
You did a commercial for adult diapers!

05:13.872 --> 05:15.406
In Japan!

05:15.583 --> 05:18.395
In full-face Kabuki makeup!

05:18.420 --> 05:20.454
Okay. As your acting publicist,

05:20.479 --> 05:22.313
I'm putting my foot down.

05:22.338 --> 05:23.930
We're doing this. You need the money,

05:23.955 --> 05:25.632
and this is how you're gonna get it.

05:26.565 --> 05:28.066
Look at you.

05:28.091 --> 05:30.130
- Hmm!
- Very well.

05:30.155 --> 05:32.000
But there will be a safe
word in case the gaggle

05:32.025 --> 05:34.960
of asymmetrical faces
gets to be too much.

05:35.182 --> 05:37.217
Deal. I'll start the car.

05:40.587 --> 05:42.355
(Car rumbles)

05:42.380 --> 05:45.779
Okay, so I told Patrick
that there's a salmonella

05:45.804 --> 05:47.290
outbreak at the cafe,

05:47.315 --> 05:50.385
so he will not be coming here
until I tell him to tonight.

05:51.052 --> 05:53.921
Oh. Is it possible you could maybe...

05:54.022 --> 05:55.589
choose a lie that doesn't make the cafe

05:55.614 --> 05:57.715
look like it's in
violation of health codes?

05:57.790 --> 05:59.825
I think it's a pretty good one.

05:59.850 --> 06:02.251
(Panting) David!

06:02.530 --> 06:04.175
You said you were only
gonna be half an hour.

06:04.199 --> 06:05.466
(Panting)

06:05.491 --> 06:07.358
Did you run here, Mr. Rose?

06:07.383 --> 06:10.580
No! Just a pleasant walk.

06:10.605 --> 06:12.973
Okay, I'm on a site
survey for the party.

06:12.998 --> 06:14.265
Why, what's going on?

06:14.290 --> 06:18.455
Well, I-I just checked in
"you know who's" parents.

06:18.480 --> 06:20.080
What? They're not supposed to be here

06:20.105 --> 06:21.839
for another 11 minutes!

06:21.864 --> 06:23.765
Well, nothing to worry about.

06:23.790 --> 06:26.225
Um, random question for you.

06:26.436 --> 06:29.538
They're aware that you
and Patrick are uh...

06:29.616 --> 06:32.418
romantically involved, right?

06:32.590 --> 06:34.758
Of course they are.
Why wouldn't they be?

06:34.929 --> 06:37.040
Well, they're definitely aware

06:37.065 --> 06:38.899
that you're business partners,

06:38.924 --> 06:41.044
it's just that uh, if I recall,

06:41.069 --> 06:44.528
at one point Patrick was engaged

06:44.553 --> 06:46.273
ahem... to a woman, so...

06:46.374 --> 06:48.041
Okay, what did you say to them?

06:48.143 --> 06:49.243
Nothing, nothing!

06:49.268 --> 06:51.654
It's more how they
reacted when I brought up

06:51.679 --> 06:53.390
the fact that you two were...

06:53.882 --> 06:56.426
romantically in
business with each other.

06:56.451 --> 06:57.234
Ew!

06:57.259 --> 06:59.395
Yeah, they-they looked
a little... shaken.

06:59.420 --> 07:01.822
- Shaken?
- Well, upset.

07:01.847 --> 07:04.348
- Upset?!
- David, they know, right?

07:04.526 --> 07:05.959
Of course they know!

07:05.984 --> 07:08.252
I wouldn't have asked them
to come here if I didn't think

07:08.277 --> 07:10.640
they knew we were in a relationship!

07:12.382 --> 07:13.867
They call the store all the time!

07:13.968 --> 07:15.569
I mean, what do they think,

07:15.594 --> 07:17.762
I'm just his business partner?!

07:17.787 --> 07:19.588
- Possibly.
- I mean, yeah.

07:19.613 --> 07:21.451
Oh my God! Okay!

07:21.476 --> 07:24.578
Everybody calm down! Nobody
say a word to anybody!

07:24.603 --> 07:27.126
- Well, that sounds reasonable.
- What did I just say?!

07:29.150 --> 07:31.318
(Car door slams, horn honks)

07:31.419 --> 07:32.786
A few things to expect.

07:32.887 --> 07:35.122
Now, the fans will either
want a signed picture,

07:35.223 --> 07:36.263
a picture and a handshake,

07:36.357 --> 07:38.192
or a picture either of you, or with you.

07:38.293 --> 07:39.593
Well, that's reasonable.

07:39.618 --> 07:42.138
Now, if they ask for
pictures of your feet...

07:42.163 --> 07:44.798
Hailey, you have been more than helpful.

07:44.823 --> 07:47.358
If I might have a moment
alone with my daughter?

07:47.383 --> 07:49.773
Slash publicist, thank you.

07:50.877 --> 07:54.980
Alexis dear, now is bad
a time as any to tell you.

07:55.005 --> 07:57.044
There is a dark side
to Mummy's industry,

07:57.069 --> 08:00.538
and I've tried to protect
you from it your whole life.

08:00.563 --> 08:03.131
You took me to the Playboy
Mansion when I was seven.

08:03.156 --> 08:06.092
And you had a wonderful time
in the children's grotto.

08:06.272 --> 08:07.705
But, this!

08:07.730 --> 08:10.498
Alexis, you shouldn't have to see this.

08:10.825 --> 08:13.060
Thespians selling their
autographs for money

08:13.085 --> 08:16.087
in cheerless convention centers.

08:16.112 --> 08:17.473
- Mhmm.
- Oh God, no!

08:17.498 --> 08:18.999
We have to get out of here, Alexis!

08:19.024 --> 08:22.627
- What's going on?
- That's Gloria Gregson.

08:22.804 --> 08:25.305
Who's Gloria Gregson?

08:25.330 --> 08:27.031
Who's Gloria Gregson?!

08:27.056 --> 08:29.209
She only played Grace
on "Touched With Grace"

08:29.234 --> 08:30.787
for 37 years.

08:30.812 --> 08:33.780
The woman has 17 Emmys
for playing a hot-headed

08:33.804 --> 08:36.626
nurse who healed people
with her sexual touch.

08:36.650 --> 08:39.852
I can't have her see
me in a place like this!

08:39.878 --> 08:41.913
- Come on!
- Moira?

08:41.938 --> 08:43.605
Mmm!

08:43.630 --> 08:46.287
No, no, it is...

08:46.892 --> 08:48.826
the Gloria Gregson?

08:48.851 --> 08:51.398
Oh, darling!

08:51.423 --> 08:54.162
Well, look at you, you look gorgeous!

08:54.187 --> 08:55.869
I'm so glad you're here, darling.

08:55.894 --> 08:59.197
I'm usually the only
marquee name at these things.

08:59.222 --> 09:02.175
I'm shocked by my presence as well.

09:02.200 --> 09:05.688
And I am Alexis Rose, Moira's
publicist and daughter.

09:05.713 --> 09:08.015
Oh! Daughter? More like sister.

09:08.040 --> 09:10.802
- (Laughs)
- Ew.

09:12.620 --> 09:14.554
(Insects buzz)

09:17.801 --> 09:19.669
(Key rattles in lock)

09:19.694 --> 09:21.161
Happy Birthday!

09:21.186 --> 09:22.220
Thank you.

09:22.245 --> 09:24.679
Flowers are for you;
the pizza's my lunch.

09:24.932 --> 09:26.849
- Hi.
- Hi.

09:26.950 --> 09:30.980
Mm! So, how's the store?

09:31.005 --> 09:34.107
Thriving. But more
importantly, how are you?

09:34.132 --> 09:38.254
You gotten some calls from
some family or friends?

09:38.279 --> 09:40.239
Yeah, I talked to my
parents a little while ago.

09:40.264 --> 09:42.132
They're on like, a weekend getaway,

09:42.157 --> 09:44.191
so they couldn't chat long, but...

09:44.216 --> 09:45.984
Did you tell them about dinner?

09:46.009 --> 09:48.265
Uh, they were actually just
pulling up to their hotel

09:48.289 --> 09:51.024
so they had to jump off but...

09:51.049 --> 09:55.838
Oh. Um, speaking of your parents,

09:55.863 --> 09:57.374
I've been piecing
together that I don't think

09:57.398 --> 10:01.240
I ever spoken to them outside of work.

10:01.418 --> 10:02.751
Is that weird?

10:02.970 --> 10:06.907
Okay. I'm sure you... I'm sure you have.

10:06.932 --> 10:07.990
Yeah...

10:08.678 --> 10:11.881
Like, they know about me, right?

10:12.280 --> 10:14.024
Of course they know about
you, what do you mean?

10:14.048 --> 10:15.279
What are you-why?

10:17.230 --> 10:20.032
Like they know about "us", right?

10:22.378 --> 10:23.711
Um...

10:28.435 --> 10:30.897
<i>Okay listen, David.</i>

10:30.922 --> 10:32.942
I've have been wanting
to tell them about us.

10:32.967 --> 10:36.746
I really have, I just was
waiting to do it in person,

10:36.771 --> 10:39.573
and then I didn't go
home for the holidays,

10:39.598 --> 10:41.818
and then I was feeling
so comfortable with you,

10:41.843 --> 10:43.844
- and your family.
- Yeah.

10:43.884 --> 10:46.981
Yeah, I-I don't know
why I assumed, um...

10:48.616 --> 10:51.518
So all this time, your parents
thought they were just...

10:51.543 --> 10:54.927
talking to your...
your business partner?

10:57.257 --> 10:58.690
Okay.

11:00.562 --> 11:02.663
David, I know my
parents are good people,

11:05.900 --> 11:07.701
I just... (Emotional exhale)

11:07.726 --> 11:09.296
Hmm...

11:09.675 --> 11:12.076
I can't shake this, this fear that...

11:13.096 --> 11:16.399
there is a small chance that
this could change everything.

11:17.069 --> 11:18.588
That they might see me differently,

11:18.613 --> 11:19.980
or treat me differently.

11:20.005 --> 11:21.858
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.

11:21.883 --> 11:23.192
But I'm gonna deal with this

11:23.217 --> 11:24.553
as soon as I see them next, okay?

11:24.578 --> 11:27.980
Okay, what you're dealing
with is very personal.

11:28.162 --> 11:31.335
And something you should
only do on your terms.

11:32.285 --> 11:33.452
Okay?

11:37.398 --> 11:38.942
That's why I brought
this couple home one day

11:38.966 --> 11:40.944
in college, and just told
my parents to deal with it.

11:40.969 --> 11:43.204
(Laughs)

11:43.229 --> 11:44.814
I'm a take-charge guy, David.

11:44.839 --> 11:46.784
I like to take charge of things
in my life, you know that.

11:46.809 --> 11:48.136
Yep, mhmm.

11:49.673 --> 11:53.389
You're upset. I would be, too.

11:53.414 --> 11:56.149
Yeah. Uh, it's not about that.

11:57.885 --> 11:59.706
Ahem... heh.

11:59.731 --> 12:01.497
You're gonna laugh yourself

12:01.522 --> 12:03.457
right out of the closet on this one.

12:03.482 --> 12:06.175
You know how you've always
wanted a surprise party?

12:06.814 --> 12:09.472
David, I don't think this
is how surprise parties work.

12:09.497 --> 12:11.364
Yeah, I know, it's just...

12:11.389 --> 12:14.699
part of that surprise was inviting...

12:14.930 --> 12:17.841
your parents... here.

12:18.891 --> 12:20.292
What?

12:20.317 --> 12:23.143
Yeah. I realize that was a big mistake.

12:23.168 --> 12:25.736
I-I should've talked to you.

12:30.117 --> 12:33.553
I could be just your
business partner tonight.

12:33.849 --> 12:36.490
- If that will help.
- No, David.

12:36.515 --> 12:39.060
I, I can't have you do that.

12:40.478 --> 12:42.912
I owe it to us to tell them.

12:44.767 --> 12:47.035
I want them to know.

12:48.692 --> 12:50.871
(Laughs) Yeah, maybe this whole thing

12:50.896 --> 12:53.063
is a blessing in disguise, huh?

12:55.655 --> 12:58.023
- It's at the cafe?
- Yeah.

12:58.048 --> 13:00.013
The salmonella was a decoy.

13:02.000 --> 13:08.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

13:10.598 --> 13:11.798
Ooh...

13:13.707 --> 13:14.741
(Preparatory exhale)

13:14.766 --> 13:16.533
(Knocks)

13:19.303 --> 13:22.299
Hi, Mrs. Brewer, Mr. Brewer.

13:22.324 --> 13:24.320
I'm... I'm David Rose.

13:25.137 --> 13:27.438
Oh, David, come in.

13:27.463 --> 13:29.564
Oh, thank you.

13:29.589 --> 13:30.848
Um...

13:30.873 --> 13:32.273
I uh,

13:32.298 --> 13:34.012
I brought you some things from the store

13:34.037 --> 13:36.672
as a welcome present. We
ran out of the body milk,

13:36.697 --> 13:38.165
so I threw in some extra lip balms.

13:38.190 --> 13:40.558
Thank you, David.

13:40.583 --> 13:43.218
I just wanted to come here and apologize

13:43.382 --> 13:46.084
for a very unfortunate miscommunication.

13:46.109 --> 13:48.516
So you're not in a
relationship with our son?

13:48.618 --> 13:50.018
- Oh, no. I very much am.
- Oh.

13:50.119 --> 13:52.659
Um, I was talking more
about how you found out.

13:53.493 --> 13:55.661
Was it something we did, David?

13:56.020 --> 13:57.954
- I'm sorry?
- Honey, stop!

13:57.979 --> 13:59.713
No, I wanna ask.

13:59.738 --> 14:01.573
Do you think if we'd
done things differently,

14:01.597 --> 14:03.308
- that Patrick would still be...
- I understand that this news

14:03.332 --> 14:05.800
can come as a shock... to some people.

14:05.825 --> 14:08.726
But he is still the same person,

14:08.751 --> 14:10.628
and it's his birthday, and he...

14:10.706 --> 14:13.975
David, we're not upset
about Patrick being gay.

14:14.076 --> 14:15.410
No.

14:15.587 --> 14:17.388
Oh my God, okay!

14:17.413 --> 14:19.480
For a minute I thought this
was gonna get very dark.

14:19.505 --> 14:21.206
Ahem!

14:21.589 --> 14:23.061
The thought that Patrick
was feeling like he couldn't

14:23.085 --> 14:24.585
come and talk to us about this.

14:24.687 --> 14:27.155
Is it because we were
so close with Rachel?

14:27.180 --> 14:28.680
(Quiet knock)

14:30.151 --> 14:32.093
- Hi.
- David.

14:32.270 --> 14:34.405
Oh, hi.

14:34.430 --> 14:36.759
Hi, Clint, Marci.

14:36.784 --> 14:39.233
I see you've met my son.

14:39.335 --> 14:42.103
How are you, David? Happy, I hope.

14:42.280 --> 14:43.580
Uh, 'cause at the end of the day,

14:43.605 --> 14:45.406
that-that's all that matters, isn't it?

14:45.431 --> 14:46.765
Dad, it's fine.

14:46.934 --> 14:50.299
They, they are fine
with Patrick being gay.

14:51.049 --> 14:53.205
Oh. Oh, good.

14:53.230 --> 14:56.198
Good, then no one really has to feel bad

14:56.223 --> 14:58.991
about how this information
came out, then, huh?

14:59.245 --> 15:00.812
So what do we do now?

15:00.913 --> 15:02.080
Not go to the party?

15:02.105 --> 15:03.516
I don't want to make him uncomfortable.

15:03.540 --> 15:06.342
No, no, no, we are
all going to the party.

15:06.443 --> 15:09.478
Patrick is planning
on telling you tonight.

15:09.580 --> 15:11.391
So I think the best birthday
gift we could give him

15:11.415 --> 15:13.249
at this point is to just...

15:13.426 --> 15:15.494
keep him in the closet until then.

15:15.595 --> 15:17.029
I know that came out wrong,

15:17.054 --> 15:19.121
but we all understand
what I'm saying, right?

15:19.298 --> 15:20.465
Okay.

15:20.490 --> 15:21.824
- Okay.
- Yeah.

15:22.893 --> 15:24.126
Whew!

15:24.151 --> 15:25.619
(Birds chirp)

15:25.644 --> 15:28.331
As actresses we have to do
whatever it takes to survive.

15:28.509 --> 15:30.943
Which is why I'm on
the convention circuit.

15:30.968 --> 15:32.702
I do dozens a year.

15:32.879 --> 15:34.746
I still can't quite believe that.

15:34.771 --> 15:36.872
Well, can you believe
that because of them,

15:36.897 --> 15:39.418
I have a vineyard in
the south of France?

15:39.519 --> 15:41.553
You may have tried my wine,

15:41.578 --> 15:43.079
"Touched With Grapes."

15:43.256 --> 15:46.358
- Oh my God, that's your wine?
- Yes.

15:46.383 --> 15:47.917
We used to use that for sangria,

15:48.018 --> 15:50.019
because it was like, so cheap, and...

15:50.120 --> 15:51.787
so good.

15:51.888 --> 15:55.625
So the fiscal sweetener
negates any discomfiture

15:55.650 --> 15:58.804
one might feel exploiting
their extremities

15:58.829 --> 16:00.563
for a $20 bill?

16:00.664 --> 16:02.999
$20?! I charge $50.

16:03.024 --> 16:05.477
And just in case, I
wear open-toed sandals.

16:05.502 --> 16:07.503
Darling, I used to spend my entire time

16:07.528 --> 16:09.081
chasing after parts,

16:09.106 --> 16:10.725
worrying about what
people thought of me.

16:10.750 --> 16:13.785
It was exhausting! But no more.

16:14.658 --> 16:17.459
These conventions are a godsend.

16:17.484 --> 16:21.154
There is a freedom in letting go, Moira.

16:22.886 --> 16:24.253
(Convention goers chatter)

16:24.354 --> 16:26.822
Okay Alexis, let's do this
before I change my mind.

16:26.923 --> 16:28.190
- Are you sure?
- Mhmm.

16:28.291 --> 16:30.103
I don't want you to feel
like I'm pressuring you

16:30.127 --> 16:31.661
- into anything.
- Oh, I'm sure.

16:31.686 --> 16:33.672
As Gregson said, to milk
this for all it's worth.

16:33.697 --> 16:35.297
So let's get it going.

16:35.475 --> 16:37.776
I have some fans to meet!

16:37.801 --> 16:39.535
(Crowd cheers)

16:39.962 --> 16:41.813
Okay, here's how it's gonna go down.

16:41.838 --> 16:43.673
It's 30 seconds each, tickets in hand,

16:43.698 --> 16:45.717
or it's back of the line, and no,

16:45.742 --> 16:48.778
she will not be clarifying
any "Sunrise Bay" plot points.

16:48.803 --> 16:50.722
- Ahem! Feet!
- Oh yes.

16:50.747 --> 16:53.182
And if we're talking
feet, it's $75 for one,

16:53.207 --> 16:54.926
$150 for the pair.

16:54.951 --> 16:56.786
(Crowd chatters)

16:57.129 --> 16:58.896
(Crickets chirp)

17:01.425 --> 17:02.525
He's coming, he's coming!

17:02.626 --> 17:04.426
Okay, he's coming, he's coming.

17:04.528 --> 17:05.560
So are we on lights?

17:05.662 --> 17:07.483
Also, we're going with "Surprise."

17:07.508 --> 17:09.407
"Happy Birthday" was too wordy,

17:09.433 --> 17:10.873
and we couldn't nail it at rehearsal.

17:10.901 --> 17:12.935
- Okay.
- Okay! Okay, great.

17:13.112 --> 17:15.579
(Bell on door rings)

17:15.605 --> 17:18.240
- (Patrick sighs)
- All: Surprise!

17:18.265 --> 17:19.566
Oh my gosh!

17:19.590 --> 17:22.211
David, I thought we were
just having a casual dinner.

17:22.236 --> 17:23.903
Mhmm.

17:24.080 --> 17:26.839
Johnny: Happy Birthday, Patrick!

17:27.117 --> 17:29.452
What is happening? I thought
you guys were out of town!

17:29.477 --> 17:31.511
- Well, we are.
- (Both laugh)

17:31.688 --> 17:33.989
We're just so happy to be included.

17:34.091 --> 17:36.659
You've got a really wonderful
friend here, Patrick.

17:36.760 --> 17:40.362
Yep, I'm just glad you could
make it, Mr. and Mrs. Brewer.

17:40.464 --> 17:41.697
Um...

17:41.874 --> 17:43.775
well, I should leave
you all to catch up,

17:43.800 --> 17:45.768
and spend some quality
time with your son.

17:45.945 --> 17:47.746
But might I recommend the crab cakes?

17:47.771 --> 17:50.224
I over-ordered, and they
cost a small fortune.

17:50.249 --> 17:52.317
Hey, could I just have
two seconds with him?

17:52.342 --> 17:53.576
Sure.

17:56.538 --> 17:58.839
What if they don't react
the way I think they will?

18:00.452 --> 18:01.917
Then I will be here.

18:02.094 --> 18:03.929
And we'll get through it together.

18:04.289 --> 18:05.856
Okay...

18:06.990 --> 18:09.157
- I love you.
- I love you.

18:09.182 --> 18:10.449
(Inhales deeply)

18:13.163 --> 18:15.131
<i>Well, I am suitably surprised.</i>

18:15.232 --> 18:16.599
<i>Thank you guys for coming.</i>

18:16.700 --> 18:18.467
Clint: Well, we wouldn't miss it.

18:18.568 --> 18:20.169
We just love you so much.

18:20.270 --> 18:22.204
I love you guys, too.

18:23.188 --> 18:25.089
- But um...
- Both: (Eagerly) Yes?

18:26.276 --> 18:28.677
Well, there's something that uh...

18:28.779 --> 18:29.989
that I've been meaning to tell you.

18:30.013 --> 18:32.281
- You can tell us anything!
- Honey, let's just...

18:32.306 --> 18:33.840
let him talk.

18:35.452 --> 18:36.576
Uh, yeah.

18:36.601 --> 18:38.795
So I guess this doesn't
really come naturally.

18:38.820 --> 18:41.889
Um... David...

18:41.944 --> 18:43.936
He seems like a really
great partner, honey.

18:43.960 --> 18:46.442
- Marci.
- In business.

18:46.467 --> 18:48.001
Yeah, he is.

18:49.332 --> 18:51.801
He's also a great partner
outside of business.

18:54.037 --> 18:55.481
We're together.

18:56.705 --> 18:58.583
David is my boyfriend.

18:59.284 --> 19:01.886
And I've never been happier in my life.

19:03.112 --> 19:06.848
And so I just, I hope
you guys can accept that.

19:08.985 --> 19:12.254
Ohh! You are the only thing in the world

19:12.279 --> 19:14.080
that matters to us.

19:14.662 --> 19:17.998
And if David makes you happy,
then that's all we care about.

19:19.570 --> 19:21.071
(Emotionally) Dad?

19:23.834 --> 19:25.501
I like him.

19:25.526 --> 19:28.199
I like him a lot. (Laughs)

Ah, you will in time.

19:38.511 --> 19:40.579
(Relieved) Oh man,

19:40.660 --> 19:43.062
I didn't know how I
was gonna tell you guys.

19:43.320 --> 19:46.689
Well, we're just glad you finally did.

19:46.790 --> 19:49.786

20:05.302 --> 20:09.305
So I know that you're annoyed
that the surprise got blown,

20:09.330 --> 20:11.708
but this party might go down

20:11.733 --> 20:13.734
as one of the happiest
nights of my life.

20:14.779 --> 20:16.324
Well, I guess that makes up for the fact

20:16.348 --> 20:18.208
that no one ate the crab cakes.

20:18.233 --> 20:19.435
Well...

20:21.216 --> 20:22.850
so how long have they known?

20:24.456 --> 20:25.989
- I'm sorry?
- My parents.

20:26.014 --> 20:28.549
How long have they known? About us?

20:28.613 --> 20:30.948
Um, I don't know, I don't
know what you're talking about.

20:31.363 --> 20:33.559
David, I know my parents.

20:33.584 --> 20:35.384
They're not good actors.

20:35.409 --> 20:37.176
They knew about us, right?

20:37.362 --> 20:40.464
Okay, my Dad might've told them,

20:40.489 --> 20:42.724
but he, he thought they knew.

20:42.984 --> 20:45.418
And the gift basket that you gave them

20:45.443 --> 20:47.077
that I'm hoping you paid for,

20:47.254 --> 20:48.989
that had nothing to do with you

20:49.014 --> 20:51.015
trying to smooth things over with them?

20:52.255 --> 20:54.728
It was just a very messy day,

20:54.753 --> 20:57.621
And I was, I was trying
to detangle things, and...

20:57.911 --> 21:00.684
- and just make everything okay.
- Yeah.

21:01.754 --> 21:03.688
Well, you made everything okay.

21:07.466 --> 21:09.167
Twyla: Not to step on the moment,

21:09.192 --> 21:11.489
but uh, I do have to lock up in five.

21:12.003 --> 21:13.871
- Oh.
