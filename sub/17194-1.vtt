WEBVTT

00:01.035 --> 00:02.167
Mrs. Haverford.

00:02.169 --> 00:03.769
Tell me about Kevin Corcoran.

00:03.771 --> 00:05.337
Is he prone to violence?

00:05.339 --> 00:07.039
Police!

00:07.041 --> 00:08.674
Yes, but he has

00:08.676 --> 00:10.175
an inherent nobility
inside him.

00:10.177 --> 00:11.943
- What's your name, darlin'?
- Annie.

00:11.946 --> 00:14.046
I'll behave! Please! No!

00:14.048 --> 00:16.549
If anything happens
to Annie, I will cut you!

00:16.551 --> 00:17.850
What if Corcoran comes back?

00:17.852 --> 00:19.685
Then I will be by your side.

00:19.687 --> 00:21.020
I hear you've been gallivanting

00:21.022 --> 00:22.388
around the town
with Dr. Freeman.

00:22.390 --> 00:24.256
My wife? Her brothers
were hung...

00:24.258 --> 00:25.858
from that very lamppost.

00:25.860 --> 00:27.192
She remembers the screams.

00:27.194 --> 00:28.827
- Eva.
- Copper.

00:28.829 --> 00:31.297
I'm not thinking courteous
thoughts right now.

00:31.299 --> 00:32.698
There are rumors
about Johnny Reb

00:32.700 --> 00:34.133
burning down the city.

00:34.135 --> 00:35.634
But if Lincoln wins,
New York will burn.

00:35.636 --> 00:37.403
You said it would just be
Barnum's and the docks

00:37.405 --> 00:39.371
that would burn.

00:39.373 --> 00:41.540
Remember me, Ellen?
Tell me the truth.

00:41.542 --> 00:44.476
I did, Kevin. I shared
a bed with your Ellen.

00:44.478 --> 00:46.412
Things, they spun
out of control.

00:46.414 --> 00:47.813
I killed Grindle

00:47.815 --> 00:49.648
and her sister ended up
the same way.

00:49.650 --> 00:51.417
I must warn you...
even with treatment,

00:51.419 --> 00:53.485
your wife's going to
suffer a great deal.

00:53.487 --> 00:55.454
I killed my own daughter.
Our Maggie.

What's the matter?

02:52.707 --> 02:54.206
You never seen anything bleed?

02:57.744 --> 02:59.778
I have.

02:59.780 --> 03:02.681
You live back there, the city?

03:02.683 --> 03:03.816
Yeah.

03:03.818 --> 03:04.917
Too bad.

03:04.919 --> 03:07.319
It's a nasty place, altogether.

03:28.141 --> 03:29.475
Aah! Aah!

03:29.477 --> 03:31.977
Will you stop! Ah! Ahh!

03:31.979 --> 03:33.679
Hold still, you stupid bitch!

03:33.681 --> 03:35.481
You think you can steal
business from me, do ya?

03:35.483 --> 03:38.951
Aaaah-aah! Aah-aah!

03:38.953 --> 03:42.821
Aah! Aah! Ahhh! Ahh!

03:47.795 --> 03:49.795
It was Buzzie Burke!
He did this!

03:49.797 --> 03:50.796
Where's Eva?

03:50.798 --> 03:52.965
Buzzie's got her.

04:01.608 --> 04:03.442
Welcome to the party, boyos.

04:16.555 --> 04:18.757
Come on, sweetie.

04:18.759 --> 04:21.192
Let's see what kind of
pugilist you are, huh?

04:30.870 --> 04:31.870
Ah! Ahh!

04:33.106 --> 04:34.106
Aaah!

04:38.044 --> 04:39.044
Oh!

04:41.181 --> 04:42.815
Jesus.

04:42.817 --> 04:44.416
Eva.

04:44.418 --> 04:45.517
Eva.

04:45.519 --> 04:47.319
Eva,

04:47.321 --> 04:49.087
we need to get you stitched up.

04:50.824 --> 04:53.058
Matthew!

04:54.895 --> 04:56.228
Matthew.

04:58.064 --> 04:59.565
I take my stitches,

04:59.567 --> 05:02.534
I get cleaned up,
and then I go home...

05:02.536 --> 05:04.002
come on.

05:04.004 --> 05:06.338
If I have to walk. Hello.

05:23.523 --> 05:26.425
That makes 67.

05:26.427 --> 05:27.993
Nearly had to go
kill another cat

05:27.995 --> 05:30.229
for more sutures.

05:32.933 --> 05:34.700
Your husband is a comedian

05:34.702 --> 05:36.735
as well as a Sawbone.

05:36.737 --> 05:38.370
Stay still, Miss Heissen.

05:38.372 --> 05:42.241
Does Buzzie Burke know
you brought Eva here?

05:42.243 --> 05:44.543
No.

05:44.545 --> 05:48.013
And he won't be finding out.

05:48.015 --> 05:49.848
I'm going to Hunt down
that bastard.

05:49.850 --> 05:50.983
Ahh!

05:50.985 --> 05:53.385
Another declined invitation.

05:53.387 --> 05:55.988
This time, from the
Buffalo Morehouses.

05:55.990 --> 05:58.590
Are you truly upset

05:58.592 --> 06:00.525
by who's not coming
to our wedding?

06:00.527 --> 06:03.362
I pray there's a steady
stream of declinations.

06:03.364 --> 06:05.230
I know what it is.

06:05.232 --> 06:08.166
It's having a catholic
stand up for you.

06:08.168 --> 06:10.102
It's a scandal, Robert,

06:10.104 --> 06:12.104
and I don't know
why you persist.

06:14.374 --> 06:15.841
If not for a catholic,

06:15.843 --> 06:17.676
that catholic,

06:17.678 --> 06:19.645
I would not be here
to whisk you away

06:19.647 --> 06:21.513
to wedded bliss.

06:21.515 --> 06:22.547
Ahh.

06:22.549 --> 06:24.716
The Irish race
did not hold a knife

06:24.718 --> 06:26.251
to my throat.

06:26.253 --> 06:27.352
Kevin Corcoran,

06:27.354 --> 06:29.688
your so-called best man, did.

06:29.690 --> 06:33.225
Ahh! Ahh!

06:33.227 --> 06:34.426
Ahh!

06:34.428 --> 06:35.861
Have some opium.

06:35.863 --> 06:39.364
Ahh!

06:39.366 --> 06:41.767
Ahhhh.

06:41.769 --> 06:42.768
Ahh.

06:46.073 --> 06:47.072
Yes!

06:47.074 --> 06:48.740
Pardon me, Mrs. Haverford,

06:48.742 --> 06:50.776
but your guests are here.

06:50.778 --> 06:52.277
You scheduled
an evening recital.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.250
Do give the ladies
my apologies, James,

06:58.252 --> 06:59.751
but I'm suddenly feeling

06:59.753 --> 07:00.986
terribly unwell.

07:02.356 --> 07:03.755
But, please,

07:03.757 --> 07:07.292
let the concert
continue as planned.

07:30.783 --> 07:32.451
I tried to wait up for you.

07:32.453 --> 07:35.387
You need to make sure you rest.

07:35.389 --> 07:37.889
Please, I feel good,
these days.

07:40.059 --> 07:42.794
How was work?

07:42.796 --> 07:45.430
Quiet enough. Ahem.

07:47.601 --> 07:49.701
Blood.

07:49.703 --> 07:53.071
At least it's not mine.

07:55.174 --> 07:57.442
Mrs. Maloney stuck her head in.

07:57.444 --> 07:58.944
She said Buzzie Burke's

07:58.946 --> 08:00.545
on a rampage.

08:00.547 --> 08:02.981
That he is.

08:02.983 --> 08:04.549
Do you remember what he did

08:04.551 --> 08:06.551
to my cousin Michael?

08:11.124 --> 08:13.592
Promise me you'll be careful.

08:15.661 --> 08:19.431
I am.

08:19.433 --> 08:20.966
I always am.

08:24.370 --> 08:27.739
We'll get you cleaned up.

08:27.741 --> 08:29.341
I'll make you some breakfast.

08:29.343 --> 08:31.810
I'm sure I've got some rashers,

08:31.812 --> 08:35.047
fresh from the butcher.

08:35.049 --> 08:36.148
Fine.

08:39.852 --> 08:42.054
You started to sort out
Maggie's things yet?

08:45.958 --> 08:47.559
I'll get you a plate.

08:47.561 --> 08:54.266
death, with
his sickle, stands nigh

08:54.268 --> 09:01.006
life's curtain soon
will be fallin'

09:01.008 --> 09:08.380
listen,
the angels are callin'

09:08.382 --> 09:14.920
mother, dear mother

09:14.922 --> 09:16.855
goodbye

09:16.857 --> 09:19.858
me father ran off to
catch a boat on his own,

09:19.860 --> 09:23.061
the blackguard,

09:23.063 --> 09:24.963
so me ma, meself,

09:24.965 --> 09:27.199
and the left-alive twin,

09:27.201 --> 09:29.801
we made out for Cobh.

09:29.803 --> 09:31.303
The twin died a day out.

09:33.473 --> 09:35.407
What age were ya?

09:35.409 --> 09:37.476
Nine.

09:37.478 --> 09:42.147
Christ.

09:42.149 --> 09:44.716
When I was a kid,

09:44.718 --> 09:49.488
my old man was a stevedore.

09:49.490 --> 09:52.724
One day, he took me
to work with him.

09:52.726 --> 09:54.726
A famine ship had come in,

09:54.728 --> 09:56.962
after a bad 9-week crossin'.

09:56.964 --> 09:58.730
Tare an'ouns.

09:58.732 --> 10:00.098
He took me down the hold.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.267
I could barely breathe
for the stink.

10:02.269 --> 10:06.104
Black cloud of flies hovering.

10:06.106 --> 10:09.574
Points to a pile
in the corner and says,

10:09.576 --> 10:13.512
"that's what the English
have done to our people."

10:13.514 --> 10:16.214
A heap o' Irish...

10:16.216 --> 10:19.050
a heap o' Irish all
died on the passage.

10:24.090 --> 10:27.759
Sitting in here,

10:27.761 --> 10:29.661
facing what you're facing...

10:29.663 --> 10:31.363
Christ! Hanging for not one,

10:31.365 --> 10:32.764
but three, murders, ya...

10:45.178 --> 10:47.279
Kevin know you're here?

10:50.450 --> 10:51.716
Fair enough.

10:57.690 --> 11:00.125
Tell Kevin Corcoran...
when he gets to hell,

11:00.127 --> 11:02.460
I'll have the place
all sorted for him.

11:11.637 --> 11:13.572
Mmm.

11:13.574 --> 11:16.441
Oh, it's amazing,
how a good wholesome meal

11:16.443 --> 11:18.777
will just lift your spirits

11:18.779 --> 11:21.379
at the end of a bad night, hmm?

11:24.184 --> 11:27.152
And no one could save her

11:27.154 --> 11:28.987
and that was the end of

11:28.989 --> 11:31.723
sweet Molly Malone

11:31.725 --> 11:34.926
everyone! Hmm?

11:34.928 --> 11:36.494
Fair enough.

11:36.496 --> 11:39.097
I'll go it alone.

11:39.099 --> 11:43.134
Cryin' cockles
and mussels, alive

11:43.136 --> 11:45.070
alive, oh!

11:47.140 --> 11:48.740
Mmm.

11:48.742 --> 11:50.208
Now I'd like to stay and enjoy

11:50.210 --> 11:54.846
your generous hospitality,
but, you see,

11:54.848 --> 11:55.880
Buzzie's got

11:55.882 --> 12:00.385
obligations to keep.

12:00.387 --> 12:01.786
So enjoy your sleep.

12:01.788 --> 12:03.922
And you,

12:03.924 --> 12:05.790
not a peep.

12:13.715 --> 12:15.216
Well, let's have a hand

12:15.218 --> 12:17.218
for Brigadier General
Brendan Donovan,

12:17.220 --> 12:18.986
ward boss of the 6th

12:18.988 --> 12:21.455
and a former member
of this very department.

12:21.457 --> 12:22.990
Welcome home, sir.

12:25.794 --> 12:27.628
Thank you, captain!

12:27.630 --> 12:30.731
It's good,
it's good to be back.

12:30.733 --> 12:32.800
I miss the old 6th.

12:32.802 --> 12:37.672
Now, I know that might sound
a bit daft to some of ye.

12:37.674 --> 12:39.173
I was so hungry for news
of the old 6th

12:39.175 --> 12:40.675
that I even had my secretary

12:40.677 --> 12:43.844
send the newspapers by parcel,

12:43.846 --> 12:46.013
each and every day.

12:46.015 --> 12:47.982
I read good news and bad.

12:47.984 --> 12:49.483
I read of births and deaths

12:49.485 --> 12:53.821
and all the rough and tumble
that life has to offer.

12:53.823 --> 12:57.058
And, one night, I read this...

12:57.060 --> 12:59.393
"the 6th ward is nothing more"

12:59.395 --> 13:02.196
than a cesspool
of filth and vice

13:02.198 --> 13:04.298
where the idea of honest labor

13:04.300 --> 13:07.968
is as rare
as the sober immigrant.

13:07.970 --> 13:13.407
You have officers lounging
in the doorways of brothels,

13:13.409 --> 13:16.377
refusing to enforce

13:16.379 --> 13:19.146
Sunday-closing laws;

13:19.148 --> 13:24.085
Egging on fighters,
instead of interceding;

13:24.087 --> 13:27.288
And, in essence,
aiding and abetting

13:27.290 --> 13:30.424
in the full-on
spectacle that is

13:30.426 --> 13:32.426
"Satan's circus."

13:32.428 --> 13:34.695
Sounds like a grand old
time, all right.

13:35.832 --> 13:39.667
Heh heh.

13:39.669 --> 13:42.436
Now, I don't mind
a little honest graft,

13:42.438 --> 13:44.905
a little clean vice,

13:44.907 --> 13:46.440
but I want it contained
and controlled.

13:46.442 --> 13:49.377
I want it behind closed doors.

13:49.379 --> 13:51.078
Make no mistake...

13:51.080 --> 13:54.949
our critics partake
in the same recreations,

13:54.951 --> 13:57.752
but, to them, we're scum.

13:57.754 --> 13:59.920
We're the enemy.

13:59.922 --> 14:01.722
We're the barbarians

14:01.724 --> 14:03.090
at the gates of Rome.

14:03.092 --> 14:05.259
As for me? I see them

14:05.261 --> 14:09.263
as what stands in the way
of our rising in society.

14:09.265 --> 14:10.331
So...

14:12.200 --> 14:13.601
We have to be smarter!

14:13.603 --> 14:15.536
Sharper!

14:15.538 --> 14:16.704
Better!

14:18.274 --> 14:19.940
We have to work harder
to prove our worth.

14:19.942 --> 14:23.611
You represent more
than just yourselves!

14:23.613 --> 14:24.812
You represent

14:24.814 --> 14:27.281
your family, your church,

14:27.283 --> 14:30.885
your race, and, by God,
you represent this ward

14:30.887 --> 14:33.254
and this department.

14:33.256 --> 14:35.423
We cannot

14:35.425 --> 14:37.758
abide chaos.

14:37.760 --> 14:38.926
Otherwise,

14:38.928 --> 14:41.662
we are nothing more than
what they say we are.

14:44.000 --> 14:47.902
Our time has come.

14:47.904 --> 14:50.271
We will not only run this city,

14:50.273 --> 14:53.007
we will own every alleyway,

14:53.009 --> 14:54.909
every street,

14:54.911 --> 14:57.445
and every Avenue.

14:57.447 --> 15:00.781
Now, you can be part of it,

15:00.783 --> 15:03.083
or you can get the hell out.

15:09.324 --> 15:12.293
The first order of business is

15:12.295 --> 15:16.597
to capture the reprobate
Boris "Buzzie" Burke.

15:16.599 --> 15:18.132
Now there's a nice bonus in it

15:18.134 --> 15:19.600
for the man who does.

15:22.504 --> 15:25.272
Go get the bastard.

15:28.811 --> 15:30.478
Come on, lad.

15:30.480 --> 15:31.879
Come on. Come on.

15:31.881 --> 15:33.747
Up and at 'em.
You're all right.

15:33.749 --> 15:36.617
You'll be all right
now. All right.

15:36.619 --> 15:38.085
Go on, man. Go on.

15:42.358 --> 15:43.757
Come on in.

15:43.759 --> 15:46.760
Ah. Kevin Corcoran has sent

15:46.762 --> 15:48.629
an armed policeman
to guard our door.

15:48.631 --> 15:50.264
I'll be right outside, ma'am.

15:53.468 --> 15:57.004
Everything is
going to be just fine.

15:57.006 --> 15:59.039
I shall treat Dr. Hegel

15:59.041 --> 16:02.176
and return immediately.

16:02.178 --> 16:04.378
The horse is lame.

16:04.380 --> 16:08.015
Can't you go another time?

16:08.017 --> 16:10.384
Illness does not
follow my schedule.

16:10.386 --> 16:12.786
Besides, you know how much
Dr. Hegel means to me.

16:12.788 --> 16:14.688
I plan to jump on the train

16:14.690 --> 16:16.156
and return before dinner.

16:16.158 --> 16:18.259
It's going to be fine, Sara.

16:18.261 --> 16:20.494
We're going to have fun,
just the two of us.

16:20.496 --> 16:22.229
Go on, doctor, go.

16:25.600 --> 16:27.535
You are certain?

16:27.537 --> 16:29.837
Come on, the son
of a bitch comes

16:29.839 --> 16:31.605
through the door, I'll
give him a third eye.

16:31.607 --> 16:34.441
Where did you come by
such bravado?

16:34.443 --> 16:38.145
Not the easy way, honey.

16:55.230 --> 16:58.032
Gen Donovan.
I heard you were back.

16:58.034 --> 16:59.166
How was your war?

16:59.168 --> 17:01.902
Obviously not as bad as yours.

17:01.904 --> 17:03.037
Well, if you're back
to settle up

17:03.039 --> 17:04.738
with my old man... please, no!

17:04.740 --> 17:06.973
I heard of norbert's situation

17:06.976 --> 17:08.309
from the front.

17:08.310 --> 17:09.877
Course, we had business
affairs together,

17:09.878 --> 17:13.714
but that can all be
sorted, in time.

17:13.715 --> 17:16.215
I had my accountants
pull all the records.

17:16.218 --> 17:17.984
To be honest, the first thing

17:17.987 --> 17:19.987
I wanted to do when I got home

17:19.989 --> 17:21.622
was to shake the hand
of the man

17:21.624 --> 17:23.624
who saved New York.

17:23.626 --> 17:26.292
Please. I had a lot of help,

17:26.295 --> 17:28.963
mostly from your boys
down in the 6th ward.

17:28.965 --> 17:31.231
Good to hear. They're
a fine bunch of lads.

17:34.803 --> 17:36.303
Did your contracting business

17:36.305 --> 17:37.738
suffer in your absence?

17:37.740 --> 17:40.474
I'm the kind of man
who likes to think

17:40.476 --> 17:42.710
that everything suffers
in my absence.

17:44.246 --> 17:46.313
Since you're home in time,

17:46.315 --> 17:48.549
my wedding will not
have to be so afflicted.

17:48.551 --> 17:49.950
So I've heard!

17:49.952 --> 17:51.318
The wedding of the season.

17:51.320 --> 17:54.488
It would be an honor
to have Tammany Hall

17:54.490 --> 17:57.091
represented at the affair.

17:57.093 --> 17:58.592
I never pegged you

17:58.594 --> 18:00.094
for the marrying kind, major.

18:00.096 --> 18:01.595
Even the sturdiest of bachelors

18:01.597 --> 18:04.231
yearns for the solace
of a steady love.

18:04.233 --> 18:05.599
Then it must be love.

18:05.601 --> 18:08.035
I heard your bride-
to-be's dead husband

18:08.037 --> 18:10.004
was mortgaged
up to his sideburns.

18:12.041 --> 18:14.742
Mr. Morehouse.

18:14.744 --> 18:16.944
These are all the
records we could find

18:16.946 --> 18:18.846
regarding your dealings
with Norbert.

18:18.848 --> 18:22.082
I'm always up for a good party.

18:22.084 --> 18:23.717
Major.

18:23.719 --> 18:26.854
I'm off to do
my rounds of the 6th.

18:28.156 --> 18:30.190
Amazing!

18:30.192 --> 18:31.525
And now a Tammany ape

18:31.527 --> 18:33.060
added to my wedding list.

18:33.062 --> 18:35.596
Eavesdropping is not
a charming quality

18:35.598 --> 18:37.064
in a bride.

18:37.066 --> 18:39.033
Keep this up, and I
will make you elope.

18:39.035 --> 18:41.802
Oh, don't tempt me.

18:41.804 --> 18:44.471
Mmm!

18:44.473 --> 18:46.707
In all the excitement,
I nearly forgot...

18:46.709 --> 18:48.008
great news.

18:48.010 --> 18:49.009
What?

18:49.011 --> 18:51.045
They captured
the traitor Kennedy

18:51.047 --> 18:52.880
in Detroit.

18:52.882 --> 18:54.181
Oh.

18:59.954 --> 19:01.955
Great news, indeed.

19:42.397 --> 19:45.733
What are you doing?

19:45.735 --> 19:48.402
It's a lovely tune.

19:48.404 --> 19:52.139
I told you not to touch

19:52.141 --> 19:53.507
my daughter's things.

20:10.025 --> 20:11.358
Doctor, your condition...

20:11.360 --> 20:13.360
that's why I summoned you.

20:16.498 --> 20:19.032
I'm leaving for the desert.

20:19.034 --> 20:21.101
I know, as well as you,

20:21.103 --> 20:23.036
dry air is my only hope.

20:23.038 --> 20:26.340
So I will just

20:26.342 --> 20:28.442
say it.

20:28.444 --> 20:30.744
I want you to take
over my practice.

20:30.746 --> 20:32.279
Doctor,

20:32.281 --> 20:34.014
I no longer live
in Five Points.

20:34.016 --> 20:36.416
Besides, I have
a wife to consider.

20:38.453 --> 20:41.455
How is Sara, since
she lost the baby?

20:46.327 --> 20:47.461
Frankly,

20:47.463 --> 20:51.098
a lot stronger than I expected.

20:51.100 --> 20:52.766
She learned,
by watching me work

20:52.768 --> 20:54.268
all these years,

20:54.270 --> 20:57.037
how common such
an occurrence can be.

20:57.039 --> 20:59.173
I'm happy to hear she is well.

21:01.910 --> 21:06.180
So, you will leave this ward

21:06.182 --> 21:08.549
in the capable hands
of Dr. Grimes.

21:08.551 --> 21:11.018
That insult
to the name "doctor"

21:11.020 --> 21:13.620
won't touch a patient
darker than daylight!

21:13.622 --> 21:15.756
And you know what that makes

21:15.758 --> 21:17.724
the ones he refuses to treat?

21:17.726 --> 21:19.860
Lucky!

21:19.862 --> 21:22.596
Grimes has killed more
babies than King Herod.

21:28.937 --> 21:31.438
This ward needs you.

21:31.440 --> 21:34.208
You're not being fair.

21:34.210 --> 21:35.709
This is Five Points.

21:35.711 --> 21:37.211
Fairness is an unknown quality.

21:39.582 --> 21:42.649
Well, I would say rare,

21:42.651 --> 21:45.919
but not unknown.

21:45.921 --> 21:47.888
But I cannot be its saviour,

21:47.890 --> 21:49.890
any more than you could.

21:49.892 --> 21:51.458
I did not train you to heal

21:51.460 --> 21:52.893
so you might run off

21:52.895 --> 21:54.928
and tend livestock
in the country.

22:02.838 --> 22:04.271
You're over an hour late,

22:04.273 --> 22:05.772
reporting back
to me, Detective.

22:05.774 --> 22:07.207
Detective Corcoran
is a hunter of men.

22:07.209 --> 22:08.876
That is an endeavor

22:08.878 --> 22:10.711
to which no clock
should ever apply.

22:10.713 --> 22:12.579
Corcoran,

22:12.581 --> 22:14.514
have an oyster. Princess bays,

22:14.516 --> 22:16.250
pulled fresh from the
harbor this afternoon.

22:16.252 --> 22:17.784
No, thank you.

22:17.786 --> 22:20.287
Mmm. Please, you
need your strength

22:20.289 --> 22:22.189
for when you run down Burke.

22:22.191 --> 22:23.223
Tell us,

22:23.225 --> 22:25.125
how goes the search?

22:25.127 --> 22:27.494
Frustratin'.

22:27.496 --> 22:29.763
We've raided every
location tied to Burke,

22:29.765 --> 22:32.032
even tore down the bandit
camp by the river.

22:32.034 --> 22:33.600
No sign of him.

22:33.602 --> 22:35.569
Maybe he had the good
sense to leave town.

22:35.571 --> 22:38.538
Buzzie? No, don't count on it.

22:38.540 --> 22:40.540
Keep turning over every stone.

22:40.542 --> 22:42.309
He'll slither out, eventually.

22:42.311 --> 22:44.611
Buzzie Burke
was my first collar.

22:44.613 --> 22:46.079
Really?

22:46.081 --> 22:48.749
What happened?

22:48.751 --> 22:50.584
The desk sergeant laughed me
out of the precinct,

22:50.586 --> 22:52.286
said, "this man is
untouchable,"

22:52.288 --> 22:55.656
told me I was to apologize
to Mr. Burke.

22:55.658 --> 22:57.224
And did you?

22:57.226 --> 22:58.892
I had no call to.

22:58.894 --> 23:00.694
Christ, Corcoran,

23:00.696 --> 23:02.095
always with the righteousness.

23:02.097 --> 23:07.768
Buzzie Burke made
himself very useful

23:07.770 --> 23:09.770
to a lot of people,
for a long time.

23:09.772 --> 23:11.271
So what happened?

23:11.273 --> 23:13.440
He moved himself

23:13.442 --> 23:15.742
from the asset side
of the ledger

23:15.744 --> 23:17.244
to the liability side.

23:17.246 --> 23:19.546
You care to share what
type of transgression

23:19.548 --> 23:21.381
can turn a man from
king of the streets

23:21.383 --> 23:22.883
to a hunted dog?

23:22.885 --> 23:23.884
Corcoran!

23:26.521 --> 23:27.854
Buzzie Burke started to believe

23:27.856 --> 23:29.356
his own malarkey, Detective.

23:29.358 --> 23:31.491
No, captain, thank you.

23:31.493 --> 23:33.927
I have a firm rule...
one whiskey, always.

23:33.929 --> 23:35.395
Clarity of mind.

23:35.397 --> 23:37.164
Sorry, gentlemen.
Informant says

23:37.166 --> 23:38.665
Buzzie Burke's hiding out

23:38.667 --> 23:40.167
in a flophouse over on Baxter.

23:40.169 --> 23:41.902
All right, then, go. Good luck!

23:46.307 --> 23:50.610
I do miss being
a copper, Sully.

23:50.612 --> 23:52.112
Don't you?

23:52.114 --> 23:55.115
Hmm.

23:55.117 --> 23:56.883
Ah! Oh! Ah!

23:56.885 --> 23:59.953
Andrew, I'll take the front.

23:59.955 --> 24:02.055
- Get outta my way!
- Get 'im, boys!

24:02.057 --> 24:04.691
Outside, Buzzie! Go! Now!

24:04.693 --> 24:07.828
Take him down, boys!

24:07.830 --> 24:09.997
Turn him over! Turn him over!

24:09.999 --> 24:12.432
Christ! That ain't
Buzzie Burke.

24:12.434 --> 24:14.835
Jesus, you're right,
that's bug-eye boyle.

24:14.837 --> 24:17.104
Awfully sorry, missus.

24:32.772 --> 24:35.307
Do you like country life?

24:35.309 --> 24:38.810
I was raised on a plantation.

24:38.812 --> 24:40.178
I was born into isolation.

24:40.180 --> 24:42.514
Oh, God.

24:42.516 --> 24:44.482
I can last about
an afternoon picnic

24:44.484 --> 24:46.184
in the park,

24:46.186 --> 24:48.987
then I start clamoring
for action, movement!

24:48.989 --> 24:51.556
I've been a city girl
all my life.

24:51.558 --> 24:53.458
Berlin, hamburg,

24:53.460 --> 24:55.493
New York, new Orleans,

24:55.495 --> 24:57.662
London.

24:57.664 --> 25:00.031
I was fond of the city,

25:00.033 --> 25:03.401
'til the draft riots.

25:03.403 --> 25:04.903
What they done
to my brothers...

25:04.905 --> 25:06.404
I can't find the strength

25:06.406 --> 25:09.274
to move past the memory.

25:09.276 --> 25:14.079
I was in Five Points
for the riots.

25:14.081 --> 25:17.849
Still,

25:17.851 --> 25:19.618
I close my eyes
and all I see is

25:19.620 --> 25:22.988
my brothers hanging from
that damn lamppost.

25:22.990 --> 25:24.756
You have every right
to your rage.

25:24.758 --> 25:29.828
Matthew says I can't let
the memories poison me.

25:29.830 --> 25:31.263
They weren't his brothers

25:31.265 --> 25:32.664
hanging from the lamppost.

25:32.666 --> 25:35.200
No, they wasn't.

25:35.202 --> 25:37.936
But he's right, you know.

25:37.938 --> 25:40.405
Matthew is right
about many things,

25:40.407 --> 25:42.440
but on this? I'm not so sure.

25:42.442 --> 25:45.343
You do have a choice,

25:45.345 --> 25:47.245
as hard as choosing to focus

25:47.247 --> 25:49.447
on what's still to come may be.

26:09.335 --> 26:13.038
What about you?

26:13.040 --> 26:14.539
What about what this man,

26:14.541 --> 26:16.241
Buzzie Burke, has done to you,

26:16.243 --> 26:18.977
carving his initials
in your back?

26:18.979 --> 26:20.979
How will you move past that?

26:23.716 --> 26:27.018
First, with your help,

26:27.020 --> 26:30.522
I will heal my flesh.

26:30.524 --> 26:34.326
And then, I will have

26:34.328 --> 26:36.628
this pretty little
artist boy that I know

26:36.630 --> 26:38.630
come into the paradise

26:38.632 --> 26:42.167
and paint a picture
of Buzzie Burke's face

26:42.169 --> 26:43.802
on the bottom of the new privy

26:43.804 --> 26:46.204
that I'm having built.

26:46.206 --> 26:49.641
And, until I die, every day,

26:49.643 --> 26:53.845
before I squat, I say,

26:53.847 --> 26:55.914
"good morning, Buzzie.

26:55.916 --> 26:58.950
How are you doing today?"

27:34.154 --> 27:36.488
Don't shoot! It's Matthew!

27:36.490 --> 27:39.491
Oh, shit.

27:39.493 --> 27:41.426
Agh!

27:43.162 --> 27:45.130
Hey, Dr. Freeman! Dr. Freeman!

27:45.132 --> 27:46.898
It's okay. I'm right here.

27:48.834 --> 27:50.168
Please don't tell Corcoran.

27:50.170 --> 27:51.503
I was only taking a piss.

27:51.505 --> 27:53.004
You were to protect
my wife and Eva.

27:53.006 --> 27:54.439
Come on, doc,

27:54.441 --> 27:55.907
at least be a good
nigger about it.

27:55.909 --> 27:57.342
You have got to be kidding me.

27:57.344 --> 27:58.643
Ah!

28:18.432 --> 28:20.632
So here I is,

28:20.634 --> 28:23.368
Buzzie Burke, in the flesh.

28:26.472 --> 28:28.807
Sit! Ahh!

28:28.809 --> 28:30.308
Close the door.

28:48.494 --> 28:52.030
So I hear you'se
looking for me.

28:52.032 --> 28:56.167
So I says to meself, "Buzzie",

28:56.169 --> 28:57.669
why don't you save
that cute whore copper

28:57.671 --> 28:59.904
the trouble?

28:59.906 --> 29:01.606
Why don't you go down there,

29:01.608 --> 29:04.409
"see what he wants
with Buzzie Burke."

29:04.411 --> 29:06.177
Please, Kevin, please.

29:06.179 --> 29:08.113
Silence, woman.

29:08.115 --> 29:10.715
Don't you dare soil yourself.

29:17.456 --> 29:19.924
Let's put that gun
down there, copper.

29:29.535 --> 29:31.035
That's it.

29:31.037 --> 29:32.504
Now, come on,

29:32.506 --> 29:34.439
no copper worth his salt

29:34.441 --> 29:37.542
only carries one shooter.

29:37.544 --> 29:39.043
Let's see the other
barking iron

29:39.045 --> 29:40.445
you've been carryin'.

29:49.455 --> 29:51.656
See? There you have it.

29:51.658 --> 29:54.025
Now, let her go.

29:54.027 --> 29:55.026
Aah!

29:55.028 --> 29:56.528
Ah!

29:56.530 --> 29:58.396
Now, you and me,

29:58.398 --> 30:02.367
we's gonna get real
intimate-like, hmm?

30:04.037 --> 30:07.038
Come closer.

30:07.040 --> 30:10.141
On your knees.

30:17.483 --> 30:18.483
Buzzie.

30:18.485 --> 30:20.151
Closer.

30:20.153 --> 30:23.488
I want to smell that
pretty hair o' yours.

30:25.792 --> 30:30.128
Mmm! Just like
the missus here, hmm?

30:30.130 --> 30:31.963
Come on,

30:31.965 --> 30:34.265
don't be shy.

30:34.267 --> 30:35.900
I won't bite.

30:35.902 --> 30:37.869
Not like that whore
friend of yours

30:37.871 --> 30:39.370
who took me ear off.

30:39.372 --> 30:41.472
You should've stayed out
of my little duet

30:41.474 --> 30:43.074
with Eva Heissen,
you should've.

30:43.076 --> 30:46.477
But you didn't, did ya?

30:46.479 --> 30:50.148
You thought you were
some kind of hero.

30:52.485 --> 30:54.319
Close your eyes.

30:54.321 --> 30:56.654
Close 'em.

31:02.027 --> 31:03.061
Aah! Aah!

31:06.665 --> 31:08.800
Enjoy your new home, princess.

31:15.342 --> 31:19.143
Mmm!

31:19.145 --> 31:21.279
They tell me there's
a copper here.

31:36.634 --> 31:38.334
I guess the poor, wee lad

31:38.336 --> 31:40.135
wasn't cut out
for life in the tombs.

31:50.580 --> 31:52.214
Every morning,

31:52.216 --> 31:56.452
me Johnny, he says
to me, "mummy",

31:56.454 --> 31:58.854
I love you bigger
than all Americay."

31:58.856 --> 32:02.391
Corcoran, let's go.

32:02.393 --> 32:05.427
It's all right, Mrs. McGrath.

32:05.429 --> 32:07.263
We'll do everything we can

32:07.265 --> 32:08.764
to locate John's killer

32:08.766 --> 32:12.101
and find your other son.

32:12.103 --> 32:14.303
Another Five Points guttersnipe

32:14.305 --> 32:16.472
meets his maker prematurely?

32:16.474 --> 32:18.340
Surprise, surprise.

32:18.342 --> 32:19.675
It's tough...

32:19.677 --> 32:21.810
one son dead,
the other missing.

32:21.812 --> 32:23.312
I hope you don't consider that

32:23.314 --> 32:24.480
a coincidence.

32:34.491 --> 32:36.191
I like what
I've heard about you.

32:36.193 --> 32:38.627
You went off to war and
fought like a spartan, but,

32:38.629 --> 32:40.162
when ordered to, you came back

32:40.164 --> 32:41.664
to the city and fired
upon your own

32:41.666 --> 32:43.565
during the draft riots.

32:43.567 --> 32:45.200
Can't say that's my
proudest achievement.

32:45.202 --> 32:47.603
Yes, but,

32:47.605 --> 32:50.372
you know what an oath means.

32:50.374 --> 32:52.141
You know what chain-
of-command means.

32:52.143 --> 32:54.944
Excuse me,
General Donovan, sir.

32:54.946 --> 32:56.612
I don't mean to trouble you.

32:56.614 --> 32:59.515
No trouble at all.

32:59.517 --> 33:01.150
I was let go

33:01.152 --> 33:02.518
when they closed
the Tannery on Mott

33:02.520 --> 33:04.453
and, uh,

33:04.455 --> 33:06.822
well, I'm ablebodied, uh...

33:11.494 --> 33:12.795
see?

33:12.797 --> 33:14.330
I'm not looking for a handout,

33:14.332 --> 33:16.031
but I have nine
little ones, sir.

33:16.033 --> 33:17.967
Can you swing a hammer?

33:17.969 --> 33:19.468
Like a demon, sir.

33:19.470 --> 33:21.203
Go down to the
buildings department.

33:21.205 --> 33:24.273
Tell Walton that the
organization sent you.

33:24.275 --> 33:26.108
Thank you, sir.

33:26.110 --> 33:28.911
Hmm.

33:28.913 --> 33:31.880
How's Miss Heissen?

33:31.882 --> 33:33.515
She's as tough as
any master sergeant

33:33.517 --> 33:34.783
I met in the army, general.

33:34.785 --> 33:37.353
Please, call me "Donovan".

33:37.355 --> 33:39.254
She stands to gain from
Buzzie Burke's demise.

33:39.256 --> 33:40.923
How's that?

33:40.925 --> 33:42.358
With Buzzie dead,

33:42.360 --> 33:43.859
his whores and his
gaming operations

33:43.861 --> 33:45.361
have to land somewhere.

33:45.363 --> 33:48.063
Besides, I'd say she
paid for it in blood.

33:48.065 --> 33:49.565
She could use it.

33:49.567 --> 33:51.100
I hear they keep raiding
her uptown joint.

33:51.102 --> 33:53.936
Ah, those boys in
the 16th are tough.

33:53.938 --> 33:57.106
But, by taking in
Buzzie's business,

33:57.108 --> 33:58.707
she would more than make up

33:58.709 --> 34:01.510
for what she's losing uptown.

34:01.512 --> 34:03.445
Mmm.

34:10.353 --> 34:12.487
Only sayin', if I'd have
beat my brother dead,

34:12.489 --> 34:14.590
I'd skip town, too.

34:14.592 --> 34:16.592
Detective!

34:16.594 --> 34:18.460
Would you please come up?

34:18.462 --> 34:20.529
Do you have any news
of me boys?

34:20.531 --> 34:23.197
Yeah. We looked into
your son's death.

34:23.199 --> 34:24.699
Apparently,
your boys were famous

34:24.702 --> 34:26.135
for knocking each other about.

34:26.137 --> 34:27.936
And they were known
to the police.

34:27.938 --> 34:29.438
Only one time!

34:29.440 --> 34:31.473
That toothless bitch,
Mary Monahan, said they'd

34:31.475 --> 34:33.275
broken in to her place,
but it wasn't me boys!

34:33.277 --> 34:35.143
Jesus, let's not lie
to the cops now.

34:35.146 --> 34:37.045
Oh, piss off, Mr. see-you-
once-in-a-decade himself.

34:37.047 --> 34:38.547
How would you know?

34:38.549 --> 34:41.449
Be surprised if you
remembered our names.

34:41.452 --> 34:43.518
We think Michael beat
his brother to death

34:43.521 --> 34:45.387
and ran off.

34:45.389 --> 34:47.156
Are you mad, copper?

34:47.158 --> 34:50.692
Sure, they fought,
like any boys their age,

34:50.694 --> 34:53.962
but their love for one another
was fierce powerful

34:53.964 --> 34:56.331
and wee Michael would
never leave me alone,

34:56.333 --> 34:57.800
no matter what he done.

34:57.802 --> 35:00.836
Mr. McGrath.

35:08.812 --> 35:09.812
Detective.

35:14.050 --> 35:17.186
She's out of her head.

35:17.188 --> 35:19.054
So where have you been?

35:19.056 --> 35:21.156
I was serving my new country

35:21.158 --> 35:24.193
and she was furious with me

35:24.195 --> 35:25.828
for volunteering.

35:25.830 --> 35:27.296
She's always giving out about

35:27.298 --> 35:28.897
why the hell an irishmen
would go to fight

35:28.899 --> 35:30.399
to free the niggers, huh?

35:30.401 --> 35:31.900
But I felt it was
my responsibility.

35:31.902 --> 35:34.269
We're Americans now,
you understand?

35:34.271 --> 35:36.638
Yes, we are,

35:36.640 --> 35:40.109
despite all the bastards
telling us we're not.

35:40.111 --> 35:42.911
What about your boys?

35:42.913 --> 35:44.379
I may not have been around

35:44.381 --> 35:45.881
as much as I wanted to,

35:45.883 --> 35:49.351
but no father deserves
to lose a child.

35:49.353 --> 35:51.920
I mean, my boys...

35:51.922 --> 35:55.090
I loved them,
but they were wild,

35:55.092 --> 35:57.659
brutal to one another.

35:57.661 --> 36:00.195
Of course, a mother would
be blind to all that.

36:00.197 --> 36:01.964
You know Irish mothers
and their sons, sir?

36:04.869 --> 36:08.003
Are you a veteran, yourself?

36:08.005 --> 36:10.172
I was with the 71st.

36:10.174 --> 36:11.573
That's a grand outfit.

36:11.575 --> 36:13.809
I was with the 69th.

36:13.811 --> 36:15.310
Got some shrapnel
too close to my heart

36:15.312 --> 36:17.813
for them to operate.

36:17.815 --> 36:19.314
I guess I'll carry the pieces

36:19.316 --> 36:21.216
to my grave, hmm?

36:21.218 --> 36:22.718
There's no escaping
what the war's done.

36:22.720 --> 36:24.887
Please, copper! Nothing but one

36:24.889 --> 36:26.555
heartbreak after another,
since I got here.

36:26.557 --> 36:32.794
But me sons, they're
me heart and soul.

36:32.796 --> 36:35.931
That's John on the left,
Michael on the right.

36:35.933 --> 36:39.635
Promise me you won't stop?

36:39.637 --> 36:42.004
I already promised you.

36:42.006 --> 36:43.705
Nothing's changed.

36:49.557 --> 36:52.825
What news of
the traitor Kennedy?

36:52.827 --> 36:55.061
Has he left Detroit?
Is he en route?

36:55.063 --> 36:57.296
There is nothing,
as I have said.

36:57.298 --> 37:00.633
Repeatedly.

37:00.635 --> 37:03.135
There must be some word.

37:03.137 --> 37:04.704
What is your fascination

37:04.706 --> 37:06.372
with the traitor Kennedy?

37:06.374 --> 37:08.207
How dare you question me.

37:13.247 --> 37:14.847
Status quo.

37:14.849 --> 37:18.351
Kennedy has not left
the Detroit jail.

38:11.338 --> 38:13.005
Sara Freeman, madame.

38:13.007 --> 38:15.841
Oh, Sara.

38:15.843 --> 38:17.510
I almost forgot.

38:17.512 --> 38:20.179
I was so pleased
when Dr. Freeman

38:20.181 --> 38:21.714
told Robert that you'd agreed

38:21.716 --> 38:23.449
to help me prepare
for my wedding.

38:23.451 --> 38:27.386
This is madame gautier.

38:27.388 --> 38:28.421
This is Sara Freeman.

38:28.423 --> 38:31.624
Sara, this is where
you shall work.

38:31.626 --> 38:33.559
It's so beautiful.

38:33.561 --> 38:35.061
I am a widow, therefore white

38:35.063 --> 38:36.796
shall not be
my color on the day.

38:36.798 --> 38:39.298
I'm thinking peach,
green, blue...

38:39.300 --> 38:40.800
something in pastel.

38:40.802 --> 38:41.801
I cannot seem
to make up my mind.

38:41.803 --> 38:44.704
Madame, I insist!

38:44.706 --> 38:46.439
Pink, pink,

38:46.441 --> 38:48.007
pink.

38:48.009 --> 38:51.477
Sara, what do you think?

38:53.380 --> 38:55.047
Come on.

38:55.049 --> 38:57.650
I'm hiring you because
I trust your skills,

38:57.652 --> 38:59.752
therefore I value your opinion.

39:01.855 --> 39:05.358
With your skin tone,

39:05.360 --> 39:06.993
I would choose the gold.

39:11.833 --> 39:12.832
Marvelous.

39:12.834 --> 39:15.901
Gold, it shall be.

39:24.444 --> 39:28.347
Oh, God.

39:28.349 --> 39:31.884
Ugh.

39:31.886 --> 39:34.020
He's not the other McGrath boy.

39:34.022 --> 39:36.722
Well, whoever he is,
there's a real

39:36.724 --> 39:38.557
Five Points way to die...

39:38.559 --> 39:40.459
in the gutter, with a wild dog

39:40.461 --> 39:41.961
chewing the balls off ya.

39:46.733 --> 39:49.702
I run a clean house.

39:49.704 --> 39:52.972
You do right by me,
I do right by you.

39:52.974 --> 39:55.541
There are no flim-flams here.

39:55.543 --> 39:57.810
No mickeys will be slipped,

39:57.812 --> 40:00.012
no customers robbed.

40:00.014 --> 40:04.483
I expect good, honest whoring.

40:04.485 --> 40:06.152
That's all.

40:06.154 --> 40:07.520
Any questions?

40:07.522 --> 40:09.255
Buzzie made us do asswork.

40:09.257 --> 40:10.689
Are you gonna, too?

40:10.691 --> 40:13.259
If you so choose,
but for a premium.

40:13.261 --> 40:15.661
Now, go upstairs.

40:15.663 --> 40:17.596
Richie will show you
your rooms.

40:21.201 --> 40:23.202
Looks like Buzzie's demise

40:23.204 --> 40:26.305
is going to be good
for business.

40:26.307 --> 40:28.074
Kevin.

40:30.310 --> 40:32.411
What brings you in
at this unusual hour?

40:32.413 --> 40:35.514
Just wanted to check in on you,

40:35.516 --> 40:37.783
grab a quick drink
to celebrate.

40:37.785 --> 40:40.753
The end of Buzzie Burke?

40:40.755 --> 40:43.622
That, and I'm on my way
to the courthouse

40:43.624 --> 40:46.692
to watch Francis Maguire
get what's coming to him.

40:49.029 --> 40:50.496
Come.

40:52.499 --> 40:54.934
The weapon,

40:54.936 --> 40:57.002
uh, the gun listed here...

40:57.004 --> 40:59.972
the, uh,

40:59.974 --> 41:01.674
lemat spring action revolver,

41:01.676 --> 41:03.175
right here in black and white.

41:03.177 --> 41:05.611
I know what's listed there.

41:05.613 --> 41:07.346
You do?

41:07.348 --> 41:11.016
The bullets matching
to the gun,

41:11.018 --> 41:12.518
they're listed here as well.

41:12.520 --> 41:14.320
Yes, your honor, they are,

41:14.322 --> 41:19.158
however, that
evidence has, um...

41:19.160 --> 41:21.260
well, that evidence
has gone missing,

41:21.262 --> 41:24.296
apparently.

41:24.298 --> 41:28.167
So you stand before me
with nothing

41:28.169 --> 41:30.703
but your prim little moustache

41:30.705 --> 41:32.905
and your impish demeanor?

41:32.907 --> 41:34.306
According to the law...

41:34.308 --> 41:35.941
You say "the law"?

41:35.943 --> 41:39.378
This is a mockery of the law!

41:39.380 --> 41:42.948
You and your cronies
want our streets

41:42.950 --> 41:45.151
to be ruled by
the law of the jungle?

41:45.153 --> 41:50.289
So be it.

41:50.291 --> 41:52.691
And you, Mr. Maguire,

41:52.693 --> 41:53.859
a copper,

41:53.861 --> 41:56.629
sworn to uphold the law,

41:56.631 --> 41:59.064
two of your victims were women.

41:59.066 --> 42:01.000
What kind of man
victimizes women

42:01.002 --> 42:04.136
in the most foul manner?

42:04.138 --> 42:08.841
Why, someone who is
no man at all,

42:08.843 --> 42:11.410
but an Irish beast.

42:11.412 --> 42:13.646
I shall rue the act
of freeing you

42:13.648 --> 42:17.883
for the remainder of my days.

42:17.885 --> 42:19.485
Get him out of my sight!

42:19.487 --> 42:20.753
Your honor.

42:20.755 --> 42:22.821
Next!

42:26.027 --> 42:27.960
Here's the next case,
your honor.

42:34.267 --> 42:36.902
Congratulations.

42:36.904 --> 42:38.537
The bill will come
due, Mr. Maguire.

42:48.348 --> 42:51.283
Ah, grand old five points.

42:51.285 --> 42:53.319
Home, sweet bloody home.

43:00.093 --> 43:03.062
Did you hear the news
that's goin' round?

43:03.064 --> 43:04.296
Two boys dead,
several more missing.

43:04.298 --> 43:05.497
That's a hell of a story.

43:05.499 --> 43:07.099
I can't have a repeat killer

43:07.101 --> 43:08.367
hunting my streets.

43:08.369 --> 43:10.502
Welcome to the druids.

43:10.504 --> 43:11.770
The fake-cash gang.

43:11.772 --> 43:13.038
A gun, a knife, they're just
tools to get a job done.

43:13.040 --> 43:14.340
When do we start?

43:14.342 --> 43:16.041
When Kevin and I
were first courting,

43:16.043 --> 43:18.043
there was a kind of
beauty to the silences,

43:18.045 --> 43:20.045
but not anymore.

43:20.047 --> 43:23.282
I am not asking you
to come with me!

43:23.284 --> 43:24.450
It's the rebel Kennedy!

43:24.452 --> 43:25.951
We'll be there on the day

43:25.953 --> 43:28.087
that he hangs.

43:29.305 --> 43:35.163
