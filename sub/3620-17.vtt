WEBVTT

00:04.352 --> 00:06.136
UGH! I CAN'T
FIND MY KEYS.

00:06.310 --> 00:07.572
OH, THAT'S OK,

00:07.746 --> 00:09.009
'CAUSE YOU KNOW,
IT'S ONLY
AN HOUR OR SO

00:09.183 --> 00:10.401
BEFORE
I LEAVE FOR
MY HONEYMOON.

00:10.575 --> 00:12.490
SORRY...
MRS. MITCHELL!

00:12.664 --> 00:15.450
OH, NO, NO, NO.
I'M KEEPING MY
OWN LAST NAME.

00:15.624 --> 00:17.408
REALLY? YOU'RE
NOT EVEN GONNA
HYPHENATE IT?

00:17.582 --> 00:19.497
[SIGHS]
MATTHEWS-
MITCHELL?

00:19.671 --> 00:20.585
I'M THINKING
IT SOUNDS LIKE
A LAW FIRM.

00:20.759 --> 00:21.673
YEAH.
YEAH.

00:21.847 --> 00:24.111
SO...
HOW'S CUPID?

00:24.285 --> 00:26.243
YOU MEAN COOP?
HE'S FINE,
BUT DON'T ASK.

00:26.417 --> 00:28.202
WHAT? I THOUGHT
YOU SAID
HE WAS CUTE.

00:28.376 --> 00:30.943
HE IS CUTE, BUT
HE IS ALSO A MAGICAL
PAIN IN THE--

00:31.118 --> 00:32.728
WOW! LOOK AT
THIS SPREAD!

00:32.902 --> 00:33.685
Paige: YEAH,
IT'S SOMETHING,
ISN'T IT.

00:33.859 --> 00:35.252
OH, IT'S
NOTHING.

00:35.426 --> 00:37.950
IT'S JUST KINDA
TO WISH PAIGE
"BON VOYAGE."

00:38.125 --> 00:39.474
IT'S BEEN
LIKE THIS ALL WEEK.

00:39.648 --> 00:40.866
BESIDES, IT'S NICE
HAVING COMPANY AGAIN,

00:41.041 --> 00:42.955
CONSIDERING MOST
PEOPLE IN MY LIFE

00:43.130 --> 00:44.870
ARE MOVING ON
OR MOVING OUT.

00:45.045 --> 00:46.307
I'M THINKING
SHE MEANS US.

00:47.569 --> 00:49.310
WAFFLES,
SWEETIE?

00:49.484 --> 00:52.139
[THINKS] WHEN'LL YOU
RESCUE ME FROM THIS?
CHRISTY!

00:52.313 --> 00:54.358
HEY,
NO TELEPATHY
AT THE TABLE.

00:54.532 --> 00:56.012
[CLEARS
HER THROAT]
SORRY.

00:56.186 --> 00:57.709
HEY, HAVE YOU GUYS
CHECKED INTO ANY
OF THESE RUMORS

00:57.883 --> 00:59.537
ABOUT STUDENTS
BEING ATTACKED AT
MAGIC SCHOOL, BECAUSE,

00:59.711 --> 01:00.973
YOU KNOW, IF YOU NEED
ANY HELP WITH THAT,
I CAN STAY.

01:01.148 --> 01:02.105
PAIGE.

01:04.281 --> 01:06.153
I'M JUST SAYING.

01:06.327 --> 01:10.374
[SIGHS] FINE. I AM
JUST A JINGLE AWAY
IF YOU NEED ME.

01:10.548 --> 01:11.854
UM...I'LL BE
IN BORA BORA,

01:12.028 --> 01:12.985
WHICH IS 2 HOURS BEHIND,
SO DON'T WAKE ME

01:13.160 --> 01:14.509
UNLESS YOU
ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO.

01:14.683 --> 01:16.380
BUT IT'S OK
IF YOU HAVE TO,
YOU KNOW, IT'S OK.

01:16.554 --> 01:18.687
ALL RIGHT, STOP IT,
IT'S TIME FOR GIFTS.

01:18.861 --> 01:19.949
OH, YEAH.

01:20.123 --> 01:21.603
HAPPY HONEYMOON,
FROM ALL OF US.

01:25.650 --> 01:28.392
UM, THERE'S
NOTHING IN HERE.

01:28.566 --> 01:31.352
EXACTLY. NOTHING.
AS IN NO DEMONS.

01:31.526 --> 01:33.745
AND NO WARLOCKS,
NO COMPLICATIONS,

01:33.919 --> 01:36.922
A HONEYMOON THAT
IS COMPLETELY FREE
OF DISTRACTIONS.

01:37.097 --> 01:38.489
EXCEPT HENRY.

01:38.663 --> 01:40.491
AND, BEFORE YOU SAY
ANYTHING, DON'T WORRY,

01:40.665 --> 01:43.059
PHOEBE, BILLIE
AND I HAVE THINGS
COMPLETELY UNDER CONTROL.

01:43.233 --> 01:44.930
AND, YOU KNOW, CHRISTY'S
DOING JUST FINE, TOO.

01:45.105 --> 01:46.018
YOU THINK?
OH, YEAH,

01:46.193 --> 01:47.150
ARE YOU KIDDING?

01:47.324 --> 01:48.847
WITH THE PROGRESS
YOU'VE MADE?

01:57.900 --> 01:59.858
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

02:00.032 --> 02:03.384
YOUR PURPOSE IS TO
LURE YOUR SISTER AWAY
FROM THE CHARMED ONES--

02:03.558 --> 02:05.821
NOT BECOME
ENMESHED YOURSELF.

02:05.995 --> 02:09.259
I DON'T NEED
YOU TO TELL ME
HOW TO DO MY JOB.

02:09.433 --> 02:10.391
NOW GO!

02:11.914 --> 02:13.089
NOW!

02:20.488 --> 02:22.098
YOU'RE PRACTICALLY
ONE OF US.

03:20.635 --> 03:24.204
ARE YOU SURE
YOU NEED THIS MUCH
STUFF FOR TAHITI?

03:24.378 --> 03:27.685
WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S
KIND OF MORE FOR ME
STAYING OVER AT HENRY'S...

03:27.859 --> 03:29.774
FOREVER! MMPH!

03:29.948 --> 03:31.472
WELL, I HOPE
HE'S GOT
A BIG CLOSET.

03:31.646 --> 03:34.126
ALTHOUGH THAT DOES
LEAVE MORE ROOM
FOR YOUR STUFF.

03:34.301 --> 03:35.998
OH--I DON'T...
HAVE ANY STUFF.

03:36.172 --> 03:37.782
WELL YOU WILL HAVE
STUFF. EVERY GIRL
NEEDS STUFF.

03:37.956 --> 03:39.306
WE'VE GOT TONS
OF STUFF, YOU CAN
HAVE SOME OF OUR STUFF.

03:39.480 --> 03:40.437
YOU GOTTA WEAR
SOMETHING.

03:40.611 --> 03:42.352
[THINKING]
HELP.

03:42.526 --> 03:43.788
I GUESS I'D
BETTER GO.

03:43.962 --> 03:46.313
DON'T WANNA MISS
MY HONEYMOON.
[CHUCKLES]

03:46.487 --> 03:47.966
YOU SURE YOU'RE GONNA
BE OK WITHOUT ME?

03:48.140 --> 03:50.534
WELL, WE WON'T
KNOW UNTIL
YOU'RE GONE.

03:52.884 --> 03:54.059
[LAUGHING]
I'M JUST
KIDDING.

03:54.234 --> 03:56.932
GO, HAVE
A GOOD TIME.
DON'T WORRY.

03:57.106 --> 03:59.326
OK. I'LL GO.
I'LL HAVE FUN.

03:59.500 --> 04:00.631
I'LL WEAR
MY SUN BLOCK.

04:00.805 --> 04:02.459
BYE, GUYS.

04:05.027 --> 04:07.247
SHE'S GONNA
DRIVE HENRY CRAZY.

04:08.726 --> 04:10.250
OH, EXCUSE ME.

04:14.950 --> 04:16.691
ARE YOU OK?

04:16.865 --> 04:19.911
YEAH. YEAH, NO.
I'M FINE. I--

04:20.085 --> 04:21.652
I JUST KIND OF
FEEL LIKE, YOU KNOW,

04:21.826 --> 04:23.524
THAT THAT
SHOULD BE US.

04:23.698 --> 04:25.874
YEAH, MOVING OUT AND
FINDING OUR OWN PLACE.

04:26.048 --> 04:28.224
WHAT? WHY?
THIS PLACE IS GREAT.

04:28.398 --> 04:30.182
PLUS, WE HAVE BOOK
OF SHADOWS, WE HAVE
POTION INGREDIENTS AND--

04:30.357 --> 04:32.097
PIPER...

04:32.272 --> 04:34.622
LOOK, SHE'S
GREAT, OK?
REALLY.

04:34.796 --> 04:37.799
BUT PART OF ME
FEELS LIKE...

04:37.973 --> 04:39.496
SHE'S USING US.

04:39.670 --> 04:42.891
AND I'M GONNA EXPLODE
IF SHE FEEDS ME
ANY MORE FOOD.

04:43.065 --> 04:44.719
SHE'S JUST
TRYING TO HELP.

04:44.893 --> 04:46.590
I KNOW, BUT
SHE'S NOT OUR MOM.

04:46.764 --> 04:48.940
SPEAKING OF WHICH,
MOM AND DAD ARE
IN TOWN RIGHT NOW

04:49.114 --> 04:50.681
AND THEY WANNA SEE
YOU, THEY'VE ALREADY
COME OUT HERE TWICE.

04:50.855 --> 04:52.466
BILLIE...

04:52.640 --> 04:55.033
COME ON, CAN'T YOU JUST,
LIKE, MEET THEM FOR
LUNCH TODAY?

04:55.207 --> 04:56.165
THEIR PLANE
LEAVES TONIGHT.

04:56.339 --> 04:57.601
START TO GET
TO KNOW THEM.

04:57.775 --> 04:59.560
I CAN'T.
WHY NOT?

04:59.734 --> 05:02.693
BECAUSE I'M STILL
ANGRY AT THEM.

05:02.867 --> 05:06.393
I KNOW IT DOESN'T
MAKE ANY SENSE, BUT...

05:08.220 --> 05:11.572
PART OF ME
FEELS LIKE THEY...

05:11.746 --> 05:13.182
ABANDONED ME.

05:13.356 --> 05:16.185
I'M JUST NOT...
READY TO SEE THEM
RIGHT NOW, OK?

05:16.359 --> 05:19.231
LITTLE GUY
IS HUNGRY. HEY!

05:19.406 --> 05:20.407
HOW ABOUT LUNCH?

05:20.581 --> 05:22.147
I CAN'T, I'M MEETING
MY PARENTS.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.324
OH, OK. CHRISTY,
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

05:28.676 --> 05:32.070
I SWEAR TO GOD,
I THINK SHE'S
TRYING TO KILL ME.

05:32.244 --> 05:34.638
IT'S LIKE
DEATH BY DINNER.

05:34.812 --> 05:36.771
DO YOU KNOW
HOW HARD IT IS

05:36.945 --> 05:39.034
TO SMILE WHEN
YOU'RE NAUSEOUS?

05:39.208 --> 05:40.557
THEN LEAVE.

05:40.731 --> 05:43.212
AND TAKE YOUR
SISTER WITH YOU.

05:43.386 --> 05:44.605
IT'S NOT
THAT SIMPLE.

05:44.779 --> 05:46.128
I HAVE TO DRAW
BILLIE OUT

05:46.302 --> 05:47.695
WITHOUT HER
KNOWING IT.

05:47.869 --> 05:49.827
OR LETTING YOURSELF
BE DRAWN IN

05:50.001 --> 05:51.960
AND THE LONGER YOU TAKE,
THE GREATER THE CHANCE

05:52.134 --> 05:54.092
YOU'LL BE DISTRACTED
FROM OUR ULTIMATE GOAL.

05:54.266 --> 05:55.703
THAT'S NOT
GONNA HAPPEN.

05:55.877 --> 05:57.357
PIPER'S MOTHERING
WILL SEE TO THAT.

05:57.531 --> 06:01.404
[MAN
SCREAMING]

06:03.841 --> 06:06.583
[PANTING IN AGONY]
AAAAGH!

06:06.757 --> 06:08.455
THE SHOE'S ON
THE OTHER FOOT NOW,
ISN'T IT, HUH?

06:09.673 --> 06:11.109
AAGH!

06:11.283 --> 06:12.850
HOW'S IT
FEEL, WITCH?

06:13.024 --> 06:14.156
WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON?

06:14.330 --> 06:16.288
NO ONE
IS TO BE HERE.

06:16.463 --> 06:17.768
BACK OFF, OLD MAN!

06:17.942 --> 06:19.640
[THUD]

06:19.814 --> 06:21.468
OH--
[GRUNTS]

06:21.642 --> 06:23.470
I AM CANDOR,

06:23.644 --> 06:26.777
A TRIAD,
AND I WILL NOT
BE DISPARAGED

06:26.951 --> 06:28.649
BY THE LIKES
OF YOU.

06:28.823 --> 06:31.695
[GROANING]

06:40.704 --> 06:41.662
STOP HIM!

06:41.836 --> 06:43.838
LET HIM GO!

06:44.012 --> 06:47.015
DON'T YOU KNOW
WE'RE TRYING TO
CHANGE THE WORLD HERE?

06:47.189 --> 06:48.799
YOUR WITCH IS NOTHING
COMPARED TO THAT.

06:48.973 --> 06:51.715
THAT WITCH SPENT A YEAR
TORTURING US.

06:51.889 --> 06:53.848
WE DESERVE
OUR REVENGE!

06:54.022 --> 06:55.719
AND YOU
SHALL HAVE IT.

06:55.893 --> 06:58.243
BUT NOT HERE
AND NOT NOW.

07:00.115 --> 07:01.943
WELL, THEN...

07:02.117 --> 07:04.206
BACK TO
YOUR SISTER.

07:06.817 --> 07:08.602
WHY WOULDN'T SHE
WANNA SEE US?

07:08.776 --> 07:11.082
[SIGHS] I JUST
DON'T UNDERSTAND.

07:11.256 --> 07:13.998
I KNOW, MOM. YOU KNOW,
SHE'S JUST BEEN
THROUGH A LOT.

07:14.172 --> 07:17.001
WELL, IT'S OBVIOUS
TO ME SHE STILL
BLAMES US.

07:17.175 --> 07:19.351
WELL, THEN WHY
CAN'T SHE TALK TO US
AND TELL US THAT THEN?

07:21.832 --> 07:23.312
WAIT.

07:23.486 --> 07:25.183
BILLIE, IS SHE STILL
HEARING VOICES?

07:25.357 --> 07:28.056
NO, NO. BUT
YOU KNOW PIPER
WAS JUST SAYING

07:28.230 --> 07:29.840
HOW MUCH
PROGRESS
SHE'S MADE.

07:30.014 --> 07:31.581
I DON'T KNOW,
WHEN IT COMES
TO YOU GUYS,

07:31.755 --> 07:33.453
THERE'S JUST
SOMETHING
HOLDING HER BACK.

07:33.627 --> 07:35.324
YOU THINK MAYBE
THERE'S A CHANCE

07:35.498 --> 07:37.108
SHE MIGHT GET OVER
THAT "SOMETHING"
BY TONIGHT?

07:37.282 --> 07:39.850
YOU CAN TELL HER
WE'LL MEET HER ANYWHERE
FOR HOWEVER LONG.

07:40.024 --> 07:41.199
I JUST--

07:41.373 --> 07:42.636
I WOULD JUST TALK TO
HER ON THE PHONE--

07:42.810 --> 07:44.725
WE JUST WANT
SOME KIND OF
CONTACT.

07:44.899 --> 07:45.987
I KNOW.
I KNOW.

07:46.161 --> 07:48.511
AND I'VE TRIED
TALKING TO
HER, I--

07:48.685 --> 07:51.732
[SIGHS]
LET ME JUST SEE
WHAT I CAN DO.

07:51.906 --> 07:53.777
[SIGHS] THANK
YOU, HONEY.

07:54.909 --> 07:56.214
YOU'RE WELCOME.

07:57.520 --> 07:58.956
BILLIE, LOOK.

07:59.130 --> 08:01.263
I NEED YOU TO TELL
CHRISTY SOMETHING
FOR ME, OK?

08:01.437 --> 08:04.048
TELL HER
WE LOVE HER.

08:04.222 --> 08:05.833
WE DO.

08:06.007 --> 08:08.662
BUT THAT I WON'T
KEEP PUTTING YOUR
MOTHER THROUGH THIS.

08:08.836 --> 08:09.967
I CAN'T.

08:10.141 --> 08:11.752
IF SHE WON'T
SEE US NOW,

08:11.926 --> 08:14.276
WE'RE NOT FLYING
OUT HERE AGAIN.

08:16.931 --> 08:18.454
OK.

08:28.072 --> 08:30.074
OH, NO.
NOT YOU AGAIN.

08:30.248 --> 08:31.554
YEP,
ME AGAIN.

08:31.728 --> 08:33.469
CAN'T RUN FROM LOVE,
PHOEBE, YOU KNOW THAT.

08:33.643 --> 08:35.645
OH. DOES IT
LOOK LIKE
I'M RUNNING?

08:35.819 --> 08:38.126
BECAUSE I'M
NOT RUNNING.
I'M WALKING.

08:39.170 --> 08:41.129
[CHUCKLES]

08:45.525 --> 08:46.961
ALL RIGHT, SO
ANSWER ME THIS.

08:47.135 --> 08:49.529
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU HAD A DATE?

08:51.052 --> 08:53.750
I HAVE DATES
ALL THE TIME,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

08:53.924 --> 08:55.839
[SCOFFS]
COME ON, I MEAN
A REAL DATE.

08:56.013 --> 08:58.189
YOU KNOW,
ONE THAT TAKES
YOUR BREATH AWAY,

08:58.363 --> 09:00.104
WHERE IT'S
THE FIRST THING
THAT YOU THINK ABOUT

09:00.278 --> 09:01.366
WHEN YOU WAKE UP
IN THE MORNING.

09:01.541 --> 09:04.456
ACTUALLY, IT HASN'T
BEEN THAT LONG.

09:04.631 --> 09:05.980
YEAH?
HOW LONG?

09:06.154 --> 09:08.722
UH--WELL--

09:08.896 --> 09:10.375
IT'S, UH...

09:12.987 --> 09:14.336
[CHUCKLES]

09:14.510 --> 09:16.686
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT?
MAYBE IT HAS, BUT--

09:16.860 --> 09:18.296
[STUTTERING]
SO WHAT?

09:18.470 --> 09:20.037
IT'S NOT NATURAL...

09:20.211 --> 09:21.735
SPECIALLY NOT FOR YOU.

09:21.909 --> 09:23.563
I MEAN, YOU'RE
ALL ABOUT LOVE.
YOU ALWAYS HAVE BEEN.

09:23.737 --> 09:26.174
I MEAN, NOW YOU'RE
RESISTING IT AND YOU
DON'T EVEN REALIZE IT.

09:26.348 --> 09:28.829
OK, YOU JUST HAVE IT
ALL FIGURED OUT.

09:30.134 --> 09:32.180
IT'S MY JOB.
IT'S WHAT I DO.

09:32.354 --> 09:33.268
[SIGHS]
YOU KNOW?

09:33.442 --> 09:34.922
IT'S NOT YOUR
FAULT, PHOEBE.

09:35.096 --> 09:36.488
YOU MADE A LOT OF
SACRIFICES FOR

09:36.663 --> 09:38.578
THE GREATER GOOD
AND THEY'VE TAKEN
THEIR TOLL.

09:38.752 --> 09:40.928
BUT...THAT'S
WHY THE ELDERS
SENT ME. [SIGHS]

09:41.102 --> 09:43.191
TO HELP.

09:48.152 --> 09:49.414
OK.

09:49.589 --> 09:50.502
WHAT IS THAT?

09:50.677 --> 09:52.374
WHAT ARE
YOU DOING?

09:52.548 --> 09:53.680
[CHUCKLING] I'M
NOT DOING ANYTHING.
IT'S WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

09:53.854 --> 09:55.769
IT'S COMING
FROM YOUR HEART.

09:57.466 --> 10:00.164
I DON'T KNOW, SOME KIND
OF AN ENERGY FIELD
IN YOU. UH, A BLOCK.

10:00.338 --> 10:02.340
IT'S PREVENTING YOU
FROM EVEN BEING
OPEN TO LOVE.

10:02.514 --> 10:03.733
[SIGHS]

10:03.907 --> 10:05.866
WELL, ANY IDEA
WHAT'S CAUSING IT?
NO.

10:06.040 --> 10:07.302
I DIDN'T EVEN
KNOW I HAD IT.

10:07.476 --> 10:09.826
WELL, ALL

BUT TO GO BACK
SO SOON--

29:10.792 --> 29:13.186
HIS WIFE'S
THE CHARMED ONE.

29:13.360 --> 29:15.449
AND THE

STILL, EVEN SHE
CAN'T MAKE THEM LAST,

29:18.147 --> 29:19.583
OTHERWISE, SHE WOULD'VE.

29:19.758 --> 29:22.325

TO DRAW LEO OUT

29:22.499 --> 29:23.979
FOR OUR ULTIMATE REVENGE.

29:24.153 --> 29:27.853
UNFORTUNATELY,
IT IS A REVENGE
BEYOND YOUR REACH.

29:28.027 --> 29:31.552
YOU DON'T HAVE
THE POWER TO DESTROY
A CHARMED ONE.

29:31.726 --> 29:33.032
UH, NOT
WITHOUT MY HELP.

29:34.120 --> 29:35.861
SO NOW YOU'RE

29:59.232 --> 30:00.624
YOU ALL RIGHT?YEAH.

30:00.799 --> 30:02.278
YOU KNOW,
I FIGURED IF WE
CAN'T VANQUISH THEM,

30:02.452 --> 30:04.237
WE MIGHT AS WELL
GIVE THEM SOMETHING
TO THINK ABOUT.

30:04.411 --> 30:05.891
UNLESS MAYBE YOU
FOUND SOMETHING.

ASKED HIM HOW HIS

YEAH, BUT AT LEAST
IF WE HAD TALKED
A LITTLE BIT MORE,

30:20.340 --> 30:22.342
I MIGHT BE
CLOSER TO FINDING
THE SOLUTION FOR THIS.

30:22.516 --> 30:24.170
WE'VE GOT
A SOLUTION.

30:24.344 --> 30:25.171
TO WHAT?

30:25.345 --> 30:26.346
VANQUISHING
THE NOXONS

30:26.520 --> 30:27.782
ONCE AND
FOR ALL.

30:27.956 --> 30:29.523
WE USED THE
ASTRAL PLANE.

30:29.697 --> 30:31.133

ASTRAL WHAT?

30:31.307 --> 30:33.266
Ryan: ASTRAL PLANE.
ACCORDING TO LEO,

30:33.440 --> 30:35.572
IN THE ASTRAL PLANE,
TIME STOPS.

30:35.746 --> 30:37.574
WHICH MEANS ANYONE
TRANSPORTED THERE

30:37.748 --> 30:39.533
CAN'T MOVE
FORWARD IN TIME.

30:39.707 --> 30:42.144
MM-HMM. WHAT DOES THAT
HAVE TO DO WITH
THE NOXONS?

30:42.318 --> 30:44.538
IF WE VANQUISH THEM
AND SEND THEM TO
THE ASTRAL PLANE

30:44.712 --> 30:45.887
BEFORE THEY CAN
REGENERATE,

30:46.061 --> 30:48.324
THEY'LL BE
TRAPPED THERE,
FOREVER...

30:48.498 --> 30:50.457
IN PERPETUAL
VANQUISH.

30:50.631 --> 30:53.242
OK, BUT WE CAN'T
EVEN GET CLOSE
ENOUGH TO THEM

30:53.416 --> 30:54.591
TO SEND THEM
ANYWHERE.

30:54.765 --> 30:56.593
WE COULD
IF THEY WERE
DISTRACTED.

30:56.767 --> 30:57.725

30:57.899 --> 30:58.944
BY WHAT THEY'VE
BEEN AFTER.

YOURSELVES AS BAIT?

USE OUR POWERS
FOR GOOD.

USE THEM TO STOP

BUT I CAN'T RISK IT.

31:13.219 --> 31:15.134

40:08.449 --> 40:10.625
HEY, FOUND
YOUR KEYS.

40:10.799 --> 40:12.366
[SIGHS] YEAH.
ACTUALLY, THAT'S
NOT ALL I FOUND.

40:12.540 --> 40:14.368
LET ME GUESS.
CUPID'S ARROW.

40:14.542 --> 40:15.369
SORT OF,

40:15.543 --> 40:16.675
YEAH.

40:16.849 --> 40:18.067
HEY!

40:18.241 --> 40:19.852
WHAT HAPPENED
IN HERE?

40:20.026 --> 40:21.070
WHY ARE
YOU BACK?

40:21.244 --> 40:22.245
WHAT DID
I MISS?

40:34.649 --> 40:36.782
PIPER DIDN'T
CALL ME.

40:37.913 --> 40:40.002
IT WAS YOU,
WASN'T IT?

40:41.526 --> 40:43.876
I DID WHAT
WAS NECESSARY.

40:44.050 --> 40:46.400
THEY WERE
MY PARENTS!

40:49.185 --> 40:53.363
THEY WERE DISTRACTING
YOU FROM TAKING
THE FINAL STEP.

40:53.538 --> 40:55.583
NOW, THANKS TO ME,

40:55.757 --> 40:57.411
THEY NO LONGER ARE.

40:57.585 --> 41:00.501
BASTARD!

41:02.851 --> 41:04.766
[COUGHING]

41:07.116 --> 41:09.075
CONGRATULATIONS.

41:09.249 --> 41:11.033
YOU JUST PASSED...

41:11.207 --> 41:13.340
THE FINAL...

41:13.514 --> 41:15.124
TEST.

41:16.952 --> 41:17.997
UH!
