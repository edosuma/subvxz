00:15.796 --> 00:18.095
Dude! Are you okay?

00:18.131 --> 00:20.198
Tucker! I think that's her!
I think that's Elle!

00:20.233 --> 00:23.201
Oh my... I thought you were
totally over Elle, man.

00:23.236 --> 00:25.156
At least that was the impression
I got last night

00:25.171 --> 00:28.072
when you were all,
"I'm totally over Elle."

00:28.107 --> 00:30.408
Yeah, well, that was until
she walked into my bar.

00:30.444 --> 00:33.478
Just wish there was a subtle way
I can get her attention.

00:36.450 --> 00:38.150
I don't know. You think that's her?

00:38.185 --> 00:41.553
I know. Hey, Elle!

00:41.588 --> 00:43.588
Is your name Elle? No? Okay.

00:43.624 --> 00:45.490
It's not her.

00:45.526 --> 00:48.393
Okay, you're right. I guess I don't
know who I saw on the street

00:48.428 --> 00:50.094
six months ago.

00:50.129 --> 00:52.096
Maybe I am starting' to sound
like a crazy person.

00:52.131 --> 00:56.200
Maybe? Ben, this whole concept
of strangers falling in love

00:56.235 --> 00:58.570
and searching for each other
is ridiculous.

00:59.339 --> 01:00.639
Ben!

01:00.675 --> 01:04.209
Oh... my... god. It's really you.

01:04.244 --> 01:07.212
Megan said she saw you here,
but I didn't believe her.

01:07.247 --> 01:10.549
Six... months, I waited for you.
I'm about to get married

01:10.584 --> 01:14.386
across the street, and this is
when you decide to show up?

01:14.421 --> 01:15.487
I gotta go.

01:19.993 --> 01:22.059
Who was that?

01:22.295 --> 01:24.629
I have no idea.

<b>- sync and corrections by Zac -

01:35.842 --> 01:37.508
You seriously don't know who that was?

01:37.543 --> 01:41.445
Not a clue, but whatever we did,
I was apparently very good at it.

01:41.481 --> 01:43.080
- Let's go.
- Wait. Where?

01:43.116 --> 01:45.949
Um, she just said she's getting
married across the street, man.

01:45.985 --> 01:48.152
We'll... We'll walk in,
we'll snag a program,

01:48.187 --> 01:50.803
and hopefully some dark
corner of your brain

01:50.805 --> 01:53.187
will remember what
you did to that girl.

01:53.392 --> 01:56.760
I don't know, man. My brain's got
an awful lot of dark corners.

01:59.131 --> 02:01.164
Oh my god, this ship is amazing.

02:01.199 --> 02:04.367
Twenty-four hours of activities
mixed with 24 hours of food?

02:04.402 --> 02:06.770
Am I dead?
Because this must be heaven.

02:06.805 --> 02:11.174
Twenty-four hours of salty,
sunny, delicious heaven.

02:12.444 --> 02:14.043
You know what else this ship has?

02:14.078 --> 02:15.478
A chapel...

02:15.514 --> 02:18.814
ha, could be pretty romantic.

02:18.850 --> 02:20.116
Please, tell me you're joking,

02:20.152 --> 02:22.552
because that is so not happening
while I look like this.

02:22.587 --> 02:24.987
Hah! Course I'm joking...

02:26.958 --> 02:28.457
Hey, guys!

02:28.492 --> 02:31.627
I was just scoping out your cabin
before I leave.

02:31.663 --> 02:33.896
It turns out it's true what they say...

02:33.931 --> 02:36.331
it's much easier to get drunk at sea.

02:37.468 --> 02:38.467
We're not at sea.

02:38.502 --> 02:40.502
Really? Because I'm shipwrecked.

02:42.439 --> 02:43.839
Aye, aye, aye.

02:43.875 --> 02:45.707
Woo... well, hello, Captain.

02:45.742 --> 02:46.975
Mmm.

02:49.079 --> 02:50.412
Thank you again.

02:50.447 --> 02:52.881
I... I can't believe you and Brad
gave us a cruise.

02:52.916 --> 02:54.816
Well, if you consider
your poor legal skills

02:54.851 --> 02:56.485
the reason Brad's in prison,

02:56.520 --> 02:58.753
then you sort of
gave yourself this cruise.

03:02.192 --> 03:05.660
Aw... well, I guess that means
goodbye, Mrs. Wheeler.

03:05.696 --> 03:07.762
Or in nautical terms, shove off.

03:08.765 --> 03:09.831
I'll be right in.

03:09.866 --> 03:11.399
I'm just gonna walk Mom out.

03:13.804 --> 03:16.071
Hey, Mom, can you keep a secret?

03:16.106 --> 03:18.372
Oh, sure I can. Just ask
your sister in Phoenix.

03:23.513 --> 03:26.881
The next time you see me,
I'm gonna be a married man.

03:26.917 --> 03:29.918
- Riley and I are going to elope.
- You're what?

03:29.953 --> 03:31.619
This cruise is gonna be perfect.

03:31.654 --> 03:34.322
It's just gonna be us and
the open ocean, all alone,

03:34.357 --> 03:36.790
and I'm gonna overwhelm her
with so much romance,

03:36.826 --> 03:39.293
she'll forget why she keeps
saying "No, no, no,"

03:39.329 --> 03:43.063
and she'll finally say "Yes! Yes! Yes!"

03:43.099 --> 03:46.292
Ahh... I'm sorry,
it's just so romantic.

03:46.837 --> 03:50.004
Danny... you're gonna
get married without me?

03:50.039 --> 03:53.007
But... you're my first born, my baby.

03:53.042 --> 03:56.777
You were there at my first wedding,
I should be there at yours.

03:57.814 --> 03:59.013
Well, you just can't be.

03:59.049 --> 04:00.882
And I need you to be happy
for me, Mom.

04:00.917 --> 04:03.617
- I love you.
- Oh, sweetie, I love you, too.

04:06.622 --> 04:07.688
Ex... Excuse me...

04:07.724 --> 04:09.857
Is this the Aloha deck?

04:09.892 --> 04:12.393
I... I'm looking for 37B.

04:14.129 --> 04:17.930
Oh, um... ha-ha. Lemme see this.

04:18.368 --> 04:19.700
You know what?

04:19.736 --> 04:23.937
Here is the problem. You are
actually on the Sayonara deck.

04:23.973 --> 04:26.374
Yeah, that's just two floors
down, take a left,

04:26.409 --> 04:29.677
a left, another left, and there's two
more lefts and it's right there.

04:29.712 --> 04:31.044
No, wait, it's left there,
you'll see it.

04:31.080 --> 04:32.380
Uh, you'll see it.

04:33.116 --> 04:35.817
"Sayonara." Man, I crack myself up.

04:41.324 --> 04:43.624
Oh... damn it!

04:43.659 --> 04:45.793
Sorry!

04:45.828 --> 04:47.395
Got it.

04:47.430 --> 04:49.263
I told the usher
that I was the groom's cousin

04:49.299 --> 04:51.665
Chester, and that I'd just
driven in from Poughkeepsie,

04:51.701 --> 04:54.101
where I have a summer job
working in a timber mill.

04:54.136 --> 04:57.938
I mean, the pay is decent
but the hours suck.

04:57.974 --> 04:59.640
I may have given too much detail.

05:00.643 --> 05:03.010
Her name's Annabelle, but I
don't know any Annabelles.

05:03.045 --> 05:04.745
- Are you sure?
- A hundred percent.

05:04.780 --> 05:06.681
I always rhyme girls' names
so I don't forget them.

05:06.716 --> 05:10.751
Cassie, really sassy... you know...
Lauren, kinda boring'.

05:10.787 --> 05:13.858
Suzanne, turned out to be a... well,
we don't need to talk about Suzanne.

05:14.490 --> 05:16.190
But uh, yeah, no, uh, no Annabelles.

05:16.226 --> 05:18.592
Yeah, man, well, she
sure seems to know you.

05:18.628 --> 05:20.295
Which is why we should probably
get the hell...

05:20.330 --> 05:21.429
Be cool, be cool.

05:21.464 --> 05:22.931
I know.

05:24.968 --> 05:29.102
Oh... my... god, I can't believe you
actually had the nerve to show up.

05:29.138 --> 05:31.171
Hi. Tucker Dobbs.

05:31.206 --> 05:34.775
My associate here can occasionally
be described as a horrible person,

05:34.811 --> 05:38.374
so any insight you have into his
actions would be greatly appreciated.

05:38.376 --> 05:39.721
What he's trying to say...

05:39.723 --> 05:41.669
You don't even know who she is, do you?

05:41.704 --> 05:44.390
- Yeah, that.
- Hah! That's too bad,

05:44.425 --> 05:46.292
since you're apparently
soul mates, who happened

05:46.327 --> 05:48.727
to bump into each other
at a bar, on a train,

05:48.763 --> 05:52.164
and her favorite juice place
all in one day two years ago.

05:52.199 --> 05:55.501
At least that's the way she's
told it to me... 600 times.

05:55.704 --> 05:57.636
Dude, this is just like you and Elle.

05:57.671 --> 05:59.838
This is nothing like me and Elle.
Dude, let's get outta here.

05:59.874 --> 06:01.573
Oh! You're not going anywhere!

06:01.609 --> 06:04.176
The wedding was supposed
to start 20 minutes ago,

06:04.212 --> 06:06.245
but Annabelle refuses
to come out of the bridal suite.

06:06.280 --> 06:08.947
So... you're gonna go in there
and tell her the truth.

06:08.983 --> 06:12.684
You have no idea who she is, and
no feelings for her, whatsoever.

06:12.720 --> 06:15.821
Oh, my morning after speech. Gotcha.

06:17.258 --> 06:20.359
Danny! Hi... where have you been?

06:20.394 --> 06:24.130
You missed the couples-only
skeet shooting showdown!

06:24.165 --> 06:28.768
I'm sorry, but I was busy securing
us a private lunch on the back deck.

06:28.803 --> 06:33.272
It might not be a contest,
but... you already won my love.

06:33.307 --> 06:35.441
Oh god, I can't even
think about food right now.

06:35.476 --> 06:38.076
I've already hurled three times today.

06:38.112 --> 06:39.645
That might have less to do
with being pregnant,

06:39.680 --> 06:41.600
and more to do with the
hot dog eating contest...

06:43.050 --> 06:44.717
that I won.

06:45.853 --> 06:48.086
Well, maybe you should go lie down.

06:48.122 --> 06:51.189
Or, even better,
we could go lie down together.

06:51.225 --> 06:54.126
I'm sorry, there is no way I can
even think about lying down

06:54.161 --> 06:56.228
right now when there is
so much for us to do.

06:56.263 --> 06:58.031
All right, there is a ping pong
trophy with our name on it.

06:58.240 --> 07:01.541
No, seriously, I put our name
on it, I am that confident.

07:01.576 --> 07:04.477
Oh... will you go get our camera,
I want a picture of our big win.

07:04.513 --> 07:08.348
Not the picture I was hoping'
to be posing' for... but sure.

07:08.383 --> 07:09.516
Thank you.

07:11.453 --> 07:14.654
Of course I am Edgar... Baldersnatch.

07:14.689 --> 07:15.688
Mm.

07:15.724 --> 07:18.291
You think I had it bad,
my dad's name was Mary.

07:20.521 --> 07:23.154
Mom? What are you doing' here?

07:23.289 --> 07:28.268
What? God, who are you?
What year is it? Help!

07:28.303 --> 07:29.970
Mom, you can't just fake memory loss

07:30.005 --> 07:31.504
every time you wanna
get outta something'.

07:31.539 --> 07:36.476
Uch! Fine! I refuse to let you
and Riley get married without me.

07:36.511 --> 07:37.643
Well, there might not be a wedding.

07:37.679 --> 07:40.913
Every time I try to bring it up,
she runs off to another activity.

07:40.949 --> 07:44.517
All right. I will help you
convince Riley to marry you,

07:44.552 --> 07:46.218
but I want something in return.

07:46.253 --> 07:48.187
An invite to the ceremony.

07:48.222 --> 07:51.423
Fine. But I want something
in return, too.

07:51.459 --> 07:53.792
Help getting' Riley to marry me.

07:56.063 --> 08:00.332
Okay. You drive a hard
bargain, but I'm in.

08:02.504 --> 08:04.604
Go away.

08:04.639 --> 08:05.938
Hey, it's Ben.

08:05.973 --> 08:09.903
Oh, my god! You came for me!
I knew you would!

08:10.979 --> 08:13.446
Well, at least one part of me
seems to remember you.

08:14.649 --> 08:18.952
And everyone said I was crazy.
Well, who's crazy now? Not me!

08:18.987 --> 08:20.720
Because you're here!

08:20.755 --> 08:24.223
I am so sorry that I ever
doubted our connection.

08:24.258 --> 08:26.091
I should've never stopped looking.

08:26.127 --> 08:28.561
Yeah, about that connection.

08:28.596 --> 08:31.030
How to put this delicately.

08:31.065 --> 08:33.399
I honestly have no memory
of you whatsoever.

08:34.602 --> 08:39.001
You have amnesia?
Can this get any more romantic?

08:40.442 --> 08:43.241
No! No, n... no, I...
I don't know who you are.

08:43.277 --> 08:44.843
I don't remember seeing you,

08:44.878 --> 08:48.447
I've never spent even a second
thinking about you.

08:48.482 --> 08:49.481
What?

08:49.516 --> 08:51.616
No! That's... That's not true.

08:51.652 --> 08:54.519
How else do you explain the fact
that you're standing here now?

08:54.555 --> 08:57.922
I'm easily led astray and your maid
of honor is slightly terrifying?

08:59.490 --> 09:00.723
Oh my god!

09:00.758 --> 09:03.158
Oh my god, this cannot be happening.

09:03.194 --> 09:06.061
I... I obviously can't
marry Carlos now.

09:06.096 --> 09:08.331
Wait! You're calling off
the wedding because of me?

09:08.366 --> 09:10.165
Of course because of you!

09:10.201 --> 09:12.267
And I don't care
if you remember me or not.

09:12.303 --> 09:15.938
You're here on my wedding day.
It's clearly a sign.

09:15.973 --> 09:19.074
Hey, this Carlos, he's not
like a big guy, is he?

09:20.277 --> 09:23.879
No! He's actually
quite small for a boxer.

09:27.937 --> 09:29.825
So... when are you gonna
see her again?

09:29.910 --> 09:32.677
Annabelle? How about never?

09:32.712 --> 09:34.379
Well, what if you guys
really do have a connection?

09:34.415 --> 09:37.482
I mean, she's got boobs and a pulse,
so yeah, we've got a connection,

09:37.518 --> 09:39.918
but not a call-off-your-wedding
kinda connection.

09:39.953 --> 09:40.985
Who does that?

09:41.021 --> 09:44.121
You! You would do that!

09:44.157 --> 09:45.990
Let's just say I actually believed

09:46.026 --> 09:49.756
in your... your stupid, she's-the-one
soul mate nonsense, okay?

09:49.758 --> 09:53.126
Maybe this whole Elle business was
just the universe telling you

09:53.162 --> 09:55.662
that there really is someone
out there for you,

09:55.698 --> 09:57.864
and maybe that someone is Annabelle.

09:57.900 --> 09:59.633
I don't know...
what do you think, Emma?

09:59.669 --> 10:02.369
Go out with her.

10:02.405 --> 10:03.970
Well, I suppose since she
called off her wedding,

10:04.006 --> 10:05.726
she probably
doesn't have any plans tonight.

10:08.714 --> 10:11.096
Hey, don't forget to
sign up for the raffle.

10:11.098 --> 10:12.949
The winner gets
to drive the boat.

10:12.984 --> 10:16.019
Twenty bucks a ticket, huh?
No? Okay, all right.

10:16.054 --> 10:17.621
Mom! What are you doing?

10:17.656 --> 10:21.491
Brenda Wong, cruise director,
at your service.

10:21.527 --> 10:23.693
How is that gonna help
get Riley to marry me?

10:23.728 --> 10:25.462
Unless you stage
a wedding competition,

10:25.497 --> 10:27.830
she's not gonna show up.

10:27.866 --> 10:30.166
Wait. Should we stage
a wedding competition?

10:30.201 --> 10:32.068
Riley'll do anything to win.

10:32.103 --> 10:34.971
No, but what I can do
is alter the schedule

10:35.006 --> 10:37.607
to make sure that you and Riley
get some alone time together.

10:37.609 --> 10:40.643
For example... lip sync battle at 3:00,

10:40.679 --> 10:42.411
bah-bye!

10:42.447 --> 10:46.282
That's perfect... now we just need
to get her in the marrying mood.

10:46.317 --> 10:49.018
I've already got you covered.
Show time.

10:49.053 --> 10:51.588
Excuse me... is this chair taken?

10:51.623 --> 10:56.392
Well, I was thinking' about pushing'
'em together to spread out, but... sure.

10:56.427 --> 11:00.829
Is this your first? You and your
husband must be really excited.

11:00.865 --> 11:04.111
Yeah, we are.
Uh, he's not my husband... yet.

11:04.170 --> 11:05.837
And if he continues to blow me off

11:05.872 --> 11:08.573
on this cruise, he'll be
someone else's husband.

11:08.608 --> 11:12.209
Well, what are you waiting for?
It looks like you're about to pop.

11:12.880 --> 11:14.079
Not that it's any of your business,

11:14.114 --> 11:17.082
but, uh... it's...
it's just not the right time.

11:17.117 --> 11:20.118
I was in love
with a wonderful man once.

11:20.153 --> 11:22.820
George. We were gonna get married,

11:22.856 --> 11:26.858
but it was never
"the right time" for us, either.

11:26.893 --> 11:30.127
Sadly, he never came back
from the war.

11:30.162 --> 11:31.562
Why not?

11:32.866 --> 11:34.632
Seriously?

11:34.667 --> 11:37.668
He died! It was too late,
we waited too long.

11:37.704 --> 11:42.035
You never know what's gonna happen.
How much clearer do I need to be?

11:42.842 --> 11:45.610
Well, I just think,
if... if you'd married George,

11:45.645 --> 11:47.378
you would've
been a lonely widow, so...

11:47.413 --> 11:49.947
you're really lucky
you dodged that bullet.

11:51.017 --> 11:52.850
I'm sorry.

11:52.885 --> 11:55.086
I... I'm sure you ended up
meeting a great guy

11:55.121 --> 11:56.454
you never would've met otherwise.

11:56.489 --> 11:58.723
Actually, I did.

11:58.758 --> 12:01.659
I never would've met Harold,
the love of my life

12:01.695 --> 12:04.228
and husband for almost 40 years.

12:04.263 --> 12:06.197
See? So it all worked out.

12:06.232 --> 12:08.532
What a great story. Have a nice day.

12:11.238 --> 12:13.804
Wow, Helen!

12:13.840 --> 12:15.707
Way to stay on message.

12:15.742 --> 12:18.709
Nobody gives a crap about Harold!

12:18.745 --> 12:21.779
I'm so sorry for your loss.
George sounded like a great guy.

12:21.814 --> 12:23.981
He was an ass.

12:24.016 --> 12:26.683
Now how about those drink
tickets I was promised?

12:26.719 --> 12:27.885
No, I don't think so.

12:27.920 --> 12:30.387
The deal was, you got these
if you convinced her.

12:30.422 --> 12:31.698
That wasn't... the deal!

12:31.700 --> 12:33.867
- That was the deal...
- No, it wasn't...

12:33.903 --> 12:35.635
- Yes, it was!
- Were you even in <i> Cats?</i>

12:35.670 --> 12:37.637
- Give it to me!
- No! Just let go!

12:37.672 --> 12:40.640
Ohh!

12:43.312 --> 12:46.680
Wow. Right on top of Edgar.

12:49.552 --> 12:51.718
I'm almost too good at this.

12:53.556 --> 12:55.422
I can't believe
this is really happening.

12:55.458 --> 12:56.823
I know. Me neither.

12:56.859 --> 12:58.592
I think we may actually
have a connection.

12:58.628 --> 13:01.428
This is crazy, but...
maybe you were right.

13:03.732 --> 13:05.366
This is all wrong.

13:05.401 --> 13:07.567
Please tell me you're
talking about the salmon.

13:07.602 --> 13:09.770
No. This... everything.

13:09.805 --> 13:13.239
I mean... I literally feel
nothing for you whatsoever.

13:13.876 --> 13:16.577
Oh, well, don't hold back.

13:16.612 --> 13:18.279
I mean, you're not even a doctor.

13:18.314 --> 13:19.513
Never said I was.

13:19.549 --> 13:21.114
And you don't race motorcycles.

13:21.150 --> 13:22.849
Where would you do that in New York?

13:23.786 --> 13:25.386
And I thought you'd be funny.

13:25.421 --> 13:27.721
I always pictured us
laughing till it hurts.

13:27.757 --> 13:29.289
You didn't like my joke
about the fat guy?

13:29.324 --> 13:31.057
I was actually quite offended.

13:32.628 --> 13:34.995
Oh, my god, everyone was right!

13:35.030 --> 13:37.464
I built up a couple
of stupid coincidences

13:37.500 --> 13:39.299
into this perfect relationship.

13:39.334 --> 13:41.234
I never should've
called off my wedding!

13:41.270 --> 13:43.470
Ben Wheeler, you ruined my life!

13:47.576 --> 13:52.279
Huh. Annabelle,
made her life a living' hell.

13:52.314 --> 13:54.447
Consider yourself remembered!

13:56.311 --> 13:58.441
Only you could ruin it
with someone

13:58.443 --> 14:00.978
who's been obsessed
with you for six months.

14:02.248 --> 14:04.514
I just... I feel so bad for her.

14:04.549 --> 14:06.650
Really? 'Cause I feel bad
for you, man.

14:06.685 --> 14:10.020
You should really stop taking my advice.
I have not been right once.

14:11.023 --> 14:13.256
You know what, Tucker? You were right.

14:13.292 --> 14:15.525
This whole business was the
universe trying' to tell me

14:15.561 --> 14:17.627
that there is someone
out there for me.

14:17.663 --> 14:20.097
But it's Elle, not Annabelle.

14:20.132 --> 14:22.666
And I know it now more than ever.

14:22.702 --> 14:25.669
Too bad I had to ruin someone's
life just to learn that.

14:25.705 --> 14:27.604
Seems like a small price to pay.

14:29.241 --> 14:31.075
- We have to help her.
- What?

14:31.110 --> 14:33.376
Oh, no, man,
we already helped her realize

14:33.412 --> 14:35.243
you're not right for her, that...

14:35.245 --> 14:37.881
that just seems like a
lotta helping in one day.

14:40.753 --> 14:41.885
Ma, you in there?

14:44.223 --> 14:46.423
That's Captain Mom to you, son.

14:47.292 --> 14:48.926
Why are you wearing that?

14:48.961 --> 14:53.030
Because the real captain
is terrible at strip poker.

14:53.065 --> 14:55.499
- So were you able to do it?
- Yep, you two will be

14:55.534 --> 14:58.102
the only passengers
in tonight's dance contest.

14:58.137 --> 15:00.762
Which is now being
held on the top deck...

15:00.764 --> 15:02.105
underneath the stars.

15:02.141 --> 15:03.740
Captain's orders.

15:03.775 --> 15:05.975
That's perfect. Thank you, Mom.

15:06.011 --> 15:07.010
I just know this is gonna be

15:07.045 --> 15:09.912
the romantic kick
in the heart she needs.

15:09.948 --> 15:11.849
We're gonna remember this night
for the rest of our lives.

15:11.884 --> 15:13.016
There she is!

15:13.052 --> 15:14.537
Oh, Baldersnatch!

15:15.710 --> 15:17.876
That's the woman who stole my cabin,

15:17.912 --> 15:20.879
and then she dropped a lady on me!

15:20.915 --> 15:23.816
There's the woman
that tried to kill me!

15:23.851 --> 15:25.618
That is absurd!

15:25.653 --> 15:28.758
And as your captain,
I order you to kill this woman!

15:29.339 --> 15:30.938
Hey, could you keep it down?
I don't want Riley...

15:30.973 --> 15:33.174
Hey, what is...

15:33.210 --> 15:35.021
Mrs. Wheeler? What are you doing here?

15:35.444 --> 15:37.278
Surprise!

15:39.181 --> 15:42.616
That's it, you know, just "Surprise."

15:42.651 --> 15:46.020
She was trying' to get you
to marry the big one.

15:46.055 --> 15:47.487
Marry him? What are you talking about?

15:47.523 --> 15:52.523
You better lock him down. I would...
if I were into white guys.

15:56.598 --> 15:59.900
Look, Riley, this isn't at all how I
wanted you to find out about this.

15:59.935 --> 16:01.535
I just had this crazy idea

16:01.570 --> 16:05.371
that if the moment was just right,
we could elope on the cruise.

16:05.407 --> 16:08.408
So... instead of spending time
with the woman you love,

16:08.443 --> 16:10.284
you've spent this entire
trip with your mother,

16:10.311 --> 16:12.111
plotting to have a wedding
we've already discussed

16:12.147 --> 16:13.832
we will have after the baby is born.

16:13.834 --> 16:15.494
It's too bad this
cruise doesn't have a

16:15.496 --> 16:17.236
competition for
ignoring your girlfriend,

16:17.271 --> 16:19.370
'cause you would've taken first place.

16:19.405 --> 16:20.404
Riley...

16:28.815 --> 16:31.349
I seriously cannot thank you enough.

16:31.384 --> 16:34.552
At least my obsession turned out
to be a sweet, thoughtful guy.

16:34.587 --> 16:37.187
Yeah, you really don't get me at all.

16:37.223 --> 16:38.222
So...

16:38.257 --> 16:39.289
Not happening.

16:40.493 --> 16:42.926
I can't believe
you were able to convince Carlos

16:42.962 --> 16:44.528
to give me a second chance.

16:44.564 --> 16:46.764
Come on, you're an amazing girl.

16:46.799 --> 16:48.499
You ready to marry
the love of your life?

16:48.534 --> 16:52.903
Well, I'm not sure that really
exists, but... he's a good guy.

16:52.938 --> 16:55.105
Okay, I'm ready.
You can signal the minister.

17:00.396 --> 17:02.028
Wait! Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, hold it!

17:05.233 --> 17:06.666
Isn't he the one?

17:06.702 --> 17:08.769
Your soul mate, isn't that
why you're marrying him?

17:08.804 --> 17:11.872
Y... You just proved to me
the one doesn't exist.

17:11.906 --> 17:13.373
But he's pretty great.

17:13.407 --> 17:14.406
Let's go.

17:17.846 --> 17:19.279
Hold, hold, hold, hold, hold!

17:22.364 --> 17:25.330
Pretty great? My breakfast
burrito was pretty great.

17:25.366 --> 17:28.400
Pretty great shouldn't
lead you down the aisle.

17:28.435 --> 17:31.537
Awesome, amazing,
can't live without you.

17:31.572 --> 17:32.939
Those are the things
you should be feeling

17:32.974 --> 17:35.041
about the person you're gonna marry.

17:35.076 --> 17:38.245
The way you felt about Carlos
before you ever walked into my bar.

17:38.280 --> 17:39.779
You're right.

17:39.814 --> 17:40.980
I totally get it.

17:41.015 --> 17:43.716
Great! Let's do this!

17:46.388 --> 17:48.755
No, I don't feel any of those things.

17:48.790 --> 17:50.990
Thanks, Ben.
Can you tell Carlos for me?

17:51.025 --> 17:52.058
Bye!

17:54.195 --> 17:55.661
Wait! Where are you going?

17:57.365 --> 17:59.798
Well, maybe if we'd been allowed
to pack before we got kicked off,

17:59.834 --> 18:01.467
I wouldn't have forgotten my keys.

18:01.502 --> 18:03.970
I'll get the spare set
from the office.

18:04.005 --> 18:05.637
Whoa.

18:05.673 --> 18:06.839
What is all this?

18:06.875 --> 18:09.742
You kidding me? I just said I
didn't want to get married.

18:09.777 --> 18:11.244
This wasn't me, I swear.

18:11.279 --> 18:14.012
Oh, yeah, okay, there just
miraculously happens to be

18:14.047 --> 18:16.081
a wedding set up at the bar where
we have to come get our keys?

18:16.116 --> 18:17.276
You are honestly unbelievable.

18:17.284 --> 18:19.451
- Riley...
- Seriously, stop trying to marry me.

18:20.055 --> 18:22.589
Don't worry. I'm done.

18:22.624 --> 18:23.923
Forgive me for wanton'
to tell the world

18:23.959 --> 18:25.725
that I found the most perfect girl,

18:25.760 --> 18:28.026
and I wanna spend
the rest of my life with her.

18:28.062 --> 18:31.663
See, I don't care where it happens
or what you look like when it happens.

18:31.699 --> 18:33.132
I just want it to happen!

18:33.167 --> 18:35.334
Because to me, you're everything!

18:35.369 --> 18:38.304
I'm so sorry if that makes
me a terrible person.

18:38.339 --> 18:39.571
Danny...

18:39.607 --> 18:41.573
Riley? Hey, what are you doing' here?

18:41.609 --> 18:44.242
Your mom stowed away and got
us kicked off the cruise ship.

18:44.278 --> 18:47.913
Ohh. I was wondering
why I had such a nice weekend.

18:47.948 --> 18:49.748
Hey, any chance you wanna
help me clean up this wedding

18:49.784 --> 18:52.083
I was trying' to throw
for a girl I don't know?

18:52.119 --> 18:54.186
Wait. This isn't for me?

18:54.221 --> 18:57.356
Uhh, no, and I don't know
if anyone's ever told you this,

18:57.391 --> 18:59.758
but you can be a tad self-centered.

19:05.353 --> 19:06.919
There you are!

19:06.954 --> 19:09.722
- Hey, Mom.
- I've been calling you for hours!

19:09.757 --> 19:10.823
Are you okay?

19:10.858 --> 19:13.459
I don't know. Riley and I
had a really big fight.

19:13.495 --> 19:17.029
Oh, honey, well, why don't we
just go inside and talk about it?

19:23.638 --> 19:25.805
What is all this?

19:25.840 --> 19:27.106
It's our wedding.

19:29.411 --> 19:32.712
I've been putting this off
for all of the wrong reasons

19:32.747 --> 19:36.682
when I should have been focused
on the one right reason...

19:36.718 --> 19:39.985
that I wanna spend
the rest of my life with you.

19:40.021 --> 19:43.289
So what do you say?

19:43.324 --> 19:44.857
Will you marry me?

19:46.528 --> 19:47.627
You sure?

19:47.662 --> 19:49.895
I've never been more sure
about anything.

19:57.638 --> 19:59.071
Shall we?

20:07.948 --> 20:12.216
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today

20:12.252 --> 20:16.054
to celebrate the marriage
of Danny and Riley.

20:20.253 --> 20:23.056
I'm sorry for getting' you into
that whole mess with Annabelle.

20:23.097 --> 20:25.575
It's okay. I'm going' for drinks
with Carlos next week.

20:25.610 --> 20:27.800
He's gonna teach me how to box.

20:27.835 --> 20:29.267
At least that's what
I hope he's doing.

20:29.303 --> 20:31.469
He kept saying,
"I can't wait to get you in the ring."

20:32.373 --> 20:34.540
Well, good luck with that.

20:34.575 --> 20:35.574
I'm off.

20:35.610 --> 20:36.975
Hey, you end up getting' a date
with Vikki?

20:37.011 --> 20:39.344
Oh, no. New York is full of weddings,

20:39.380 --> 20:41.146
and weddings are full of bridesmaids.

20:41.181 --> 20:43.515
The math is on my side.

20:43.550 --> 20:45.183
It's only a matter of time.
