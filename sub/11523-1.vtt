<i>♪ Oh, the weather outside is frightful ♪</i>

00:07.466 --> 00:09.760
Merry Christmas.

00:09.844 --> 00:12.638
I made everyone stockings.

00:12.721 --> 00:14.139
Lillian.

00:14.222 --> 00:15.474
Titus.

00:15.557 --> 00:17.058
Yours truly.

00:17.142 --> 00:18.602
Mimi.

00:18.686 --> 00:19.728
And Murasaki.

00:19.812 --> 00:21.772
Murasaki doesn't do Christmas.

00:21.814 --> 00:23.273
Gosh, I love Christmas:

00:23.357 --> 00:25.066
the music, untangling things,

00:25.150 --> 00:27.068
putting lights outdoors and trees indoors.

00:27.152 --> 00:28.195
Say what?

00:28.278 --> 00:30.238
And we're all together
with so much to celebrate:

00:30.322 --> 00:32.573
special friendships and new adventures

00:32.658 --> 00:34.952
and giving a final "Later, gator"

00:35.035 --> 00:36.578
to the problems of yester...

00:38.998 --> 00:40.081
Yester... urp.

00:40.165 --> 00:41.249
You heard me.

00:41.333 --> 00:43.502
Honey, you should see a doctor.

00:43.585 --> 00:46.881
It's like a mouse died
in the walls of your body.

00:48.215 --> 00:49.383
Ho, ho, ho!

00:49.466 --> 00:52.093
Merry Christmas to all of youse!

00:52.177 --> 00:53.595
Santa?

00:53.679 --> 00:55.096
Santa.

00:56.515 --> 00:58.726
Oh, I can't kiss you. I'm married.

01:00.435 --> 01:02.229
The Jews took my painting.

01:02.312 --> 01:04.272
Now it's a party.

01:04.355 --> 01:07.651
Ho, ho, ho. You ho.

01:07.735 --> 01:09.862
Sonja?

01:09.945 --> 01:11.488
I'm gonna kill you.

01:11.572 --> 01:12.948
Aah!

01:13.032 --> 01:15.617
<i>Three months earlier on this mess...</i>

01:15.701 --> 01:17.053
I've been wanting
to bring you to this place

01:17.077 --> 01:18.996
ever since I saw it was called Sliderz.

01:19.079 --> 01:20.205
I apologize, though.

01:20.288 --> 01:22.207
There aren't actually any slides in here.

01:22.290 --> 01:23.643
But look at these tiny hamburgers.

01:23.667 --> 01:25.293
They make you feel like a giant.

01:25.377 --> 01:27.337
I'm gonna eat you up in one bite.

01:27.421 --> 01:28.672
"Please, no, I have a family."

01:29.924 --> 01:31.258
This is so fun, Kimmy.

01:31.341 --> 01:33.510
I'm so glad I ran away
from my green card marriage

01:33.594 --> 01:35.094
to go on dates with you.

01:35.178 --> 01:36.179
I'm a vegan.

01:36.263 --> 01:37.973
Wait, what did you say?

01:38.057 --> 01:39.307
I said, "I'm a vegan."

01:39.391 --> 01:42.519
I thought you knew that when we met
at that animal rights 5K.

01:42.603 --> 01:45.064
Oh, I thought that was so animals
could marry each other.

01:47.524 --> 01:49.818
Well, I think this date is going...

01:49.902 --> 01:51.403
Hated it.

01:51.486 --> 01:53.488
Oh, it's hard because

01:53.572 --> 01:55.950
you're still hung up on your ex.

01:56.033 --> 01:57.034
I get it.

01:57.117 --> 02:00.245
I still think about my first love, Bobby.

02:00.328 --> 02:04.750
We went to summer camp together
on Roosevelt Island.

02:04.833 --> 02:06.835
Little Bobby Durst.

02:06.919 --> 02:08.920
He was my first crush.

02:09.003 --> 02:11.214
Literally, he tried to crush me.

02:11.298 --> 02:13.801
It's just, I waited 15 years
to get my life back,

02:13.884 --> 02:16.177
and then I got a job, I got a boyfriend,

02:16.261 --> 02:18.722
but then the world was like, "Psych!"

02:18.806 --> 02:22.017
I know, dear, you want it all right now:

02:22.101 --> 02:24.352
the career, the husband,

02:24.436 --> 02:25.813
the teardrop tattoo.

02:25.896 --> 02:29.608
But hey, have a little fun
for five minutes.

02:29.691 --> 02:32.778
Hey, let me take you out.

02:32.861 --> 02:35.155
Ooh, I'm a great wingman.

02:35.238 --> 02:37.240
Men find me very approachable

02:37.324 --> 02:38.659
because my eyes are large

02:38.742 --> 02:40.995
and my hair is like beautiful spaghetti.

02:41.078 --> 02:42.412
I get 'em on the hook.

02:42.496 --> 02:44.706
Then we'll slip 'em a disco biscuit

02:44.790 --> 02:46.667
and pull a switcheroo.

02:47.876 --> 02:50.129
Get 'NSYNC, Kimberlake.
I got to go get divorced.

02:50.211 --> 02:52.923
Oh, we're gonna
paint the town red tonight.

02:53.007 --> 02:54.758
Ooh, two questions.

02:54.842 --> 02:57.886
Do you like Spanish guys,
and can you roller-skate?

02:57.970 --> 02:59.554
Yes, but only frontways.

02:59.638 --> 03:00.764
And probably.

03:00.848 --> 03:01.908
Oh, wait, I said that backwards.

03:44.975 --> 03:47.144
I've been standing here for hours.

03:47.227 --> 03:49.730
Watch out. I pooped over there.

03:52.649 --> 03:56.277
So, according to the license
presented by Mrs. Wilkerson,

03:56.361 --> 03:59.865
you two were married on June 6, 1998.

03:59.948 --> 04:01.575
Barely.

04:01.658 --> 04:03.577
And do you, Ronald Ephen Wilkerson,

04:03.660 --> 04:07.873
take this woman
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

04:07.956 --> 04:09.499
Mm-kay.

04:09.583 --> 04:12.211
And Mrs. Wilkerson claims
that you abandoned her

04:12.293 --> 04:15.296
on June 6, 1998.

04:15.380 --> 04:16.380
Wait a minute.

04:16.464 --> 04:17.673
That's the same day.

04:17.757 --> 04:18.759
Is it? I wouldn't know.

04:18.841 --> 04:21.178
You left before we even did
our first dance.

04:21.261 --> 04:23.555
And you know
our choreography was on point.

04:23.638 --> 04:25.182
Mm, you dropped me every time.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.809
I thought at least you ran away
to be with a man.

04:27.893 --> 04:29.061
But here you are,

04:29.144 --> 04:30.784
taking advantage of some other goofy girl

04:30.854 --> 04:32.856
dressed like she's on Scooby damn Doo.

04:32.940 --> 04:34.482
Thank you.

04:34.566 --> 04:36.443
I can't believe you, Ronald.

04:36.526 --> 04:38.361
Do not call me Ronald.

04:38.445 --> 04:39.738
Rah-nald.

04:39.821 --> 04:42.574
You think you can walk away
from your problems?

04:42.657 --> 04:44.701
Well, I found you,

04:44.785 --> 04:48.413
and I'm gonna sue you for 17 years' worth
of spousal support,

04:48.496 --> 04:50.415
$400 for the wedding itself,

04:50.498 --> 04:52.793
and I want my bridal jacket back.

04:52.876 --> 04:56.004
I'm gonna take everything you got,
Ronald Wilkerson.

04:58.257 --> 04:59.507
Really, Titus?

04:59.591 --> 05:01.271
You're just gonna run away from her again?

05:01.301 --> 05:03.762
I hear Montreal has
a vibrant theater scene,

05:03.845 --> 05:05.597
so <i>au revoir, les Felicieuses.</i>

05:05.680 --> 05:07.266
Maybe just go talk to Vonda.

05:07.348 --> 05:09.768
You haven't spoken to her at all,
and you guys were married.

05:09.851 --> 05:11.645
Kim, you don't understand.

05:11.728 --> 05:13.688
Mississippi was my bunker.

05:13.772 --> 05:17.358
I start work Monday
at Vonda's uncle's mulch business.

05:17.442 --> 05:18.568
What's that you said?

05:18.652 --> 05:21.905
I said I start work Monday
at Vonda's uncle's mulch business.

05:21.989 --> 05:23.073
What now?

05:23.157 --> 05:27.661
I start work Monday...
at Vonda's uncle's mulch business.

05:27.744 --> 05:28.744
What, dear?

05:28.787 --> 05:30.998
I said I'm a homosexual
having a panic attack.

05:31.081 --> 05:34.084
Oh, isn't that wonderful?

05:34.168 --> 05:35.168
<i>And now,</i>

05:35.210 --> 05:36.628
<i>please welcome to the dance floor</i>

05:36.711 --> 05:40.215
<i>as they begin this second
and final part of their lives,</i>

05:40.299 --> 05:44.594
<i>Mr. and Mrs. Ronald Wilkerson!</i>

05:48.140 --> 05:49.891
Aren't you Ronald Wilkerson?

05:49.975 --> 05:52.060
Who me? No, sir.

05:52.144 --> 05:53.270
I'm...

05:56.064 --> 05:58.733
Titus Andromedon.

05:58.817 --> 06:02.070
<i>Ronald Wilkerson, show your face.</i>

06:02.154 --> 06:04.239
It took all the courage I had to escape.

06:04.323 --> 06:06.950
Titus saved me from a life
of babies and mulch.

06:07.034 --> 06:09.786
Now Vonda's gonna take away
this beautiful world I built for my...

06:09.870 --> 06:11.746
Damn silverfish.

06:11.830 --> 06:13.790
What if I go talk to Vonda?

06:13.874 --> 06:15.583
Maybe I could get through to her,

06:15.667 --> 06:16.584
woman to woman.

06:16.668 --> 06:17.836
Ew.

06:17.919 --> 06:19.189
I'll take her out for ice cream.

06:19.213 --> 06:21.256
You can't be mad with a cone in your paw.

06:21.340 --> 06:23.234
Okay, but just in case,
I'm gonna keep on packing,

06:23.258 --> 06:24.527
at least until my blood sugar drops.

06:24.551 --> 06:26.261
There it is.

06:28.096 --> 06:32.309
We are here today
to celebrate one of our own,

06:32.391 --> 06:34.353
Anthony Black Elk,

06:34.435 --> 06:38.065
who's going away to Dartmouth College
in a few days.

06:38.148 --> 06:38.982
Ugh.

06:39.066 --> 06:41.318
Don't become some d-bag lacrosse player.

06:41.400 --> 06:43.904
Honey, we invented lacrosse.

06:43.987 --> 06:45.239
I don't think that's right.

06:45.322 --> 06:48.533
Anthony, this sacred pipe,

06:48.616 --> 06:50.451
the <i>chanunpa,</i>

06:50.535 --> 06:53.163
was carved nine generations ago.

06:53.247 --> 06:54.873
It survived Wounded Knee,

06:54.956 --> 06:58.210
and we used it to pray
for our brothers in Vietnam.

06:58.293 --> 07:01.129
And today we will ask the Great Spirit...

07:01.213 --> 07:02.630
What the holy hell is this?

07:02.714 --> 07:04.632
It's a tobacco vape, Dad.

07:04.716 --> 07:06.676
Katherine Heigl uses one.

07:06.760 --> 07:09.470
Smoking kills, you guys.

07:09.554 --> 07:11.973
Where is that pipe, Jackie Lynn?

07:12.057 --> 07:14.559
I held it in the air, and a hawk took it.

07:14.642 --> 07:15.643
Jackie Lynn...

07:15.727 --> 07:18.646
Oh, fine, it's in the hall closet
behind the board games.

07:18.730 --> 07:19.730
Addict.

07:23.944 --> 07:24.945
Who is that?

07:25.028 --> 07:28.282
Jackie Lynn, just use your contact lenses.

07:28.365 --> 07:29.490
You need the prescription.

07:29.574 --> 07:30.575
No, Mom.

07:30.658 --> 07:32.035
They turn my eyes blue.

07:32.119 --> 07:34.537
And that's me giving in to white culture,

07:34.621 --> 07:37.540
with their drone wars
and lip-sync battles.

07:37.624 --> 07:39.626
Well, then order plain ones.

07:39.709 --> 07:42.712
Yesterday I saw you try to milk
a male buffalo.

07:42.796 --> 07:43.797
Whatever, Mom.

07:43.880 --> 07:46.007
It worked. I put it in the fridge.

07:47.592 --> 07:50.553
And when are you gonna give back
that police car you showed up in?

07:50.637 --> 07:52.513
There's a raccoon living in it.

07:52.597 --> 07:54.308
Oh, he's not living in it.

07:54.391 --> 07:56.244
He got stuck in the back
because of the prisoner locks

07:56.268 --> 07:57.894
and he died of heatstroke.

07:58.895 --> 08:00.230
I know you mean well,

08:00.314 --> 08:02.732
but just stop trying to help.

08:02.816 --> 08:04.484
But I want to help.

08:04.567 --> 08:06.194
All I want is to be the daughter

08:06.278 --> 08:08.613
I should have been this whole time.

08:08.696 --> 08:11.158
Just tell me what I can do,
and I won't let you down.

08:11.241 --> 08:12.326
I promise.

08:12.409 --> 08:16.871
Well, you could go far, far in the fields

08:16.955 --> 08:20.875
and do the harvest super special
important dance.

08:20.959 --> 08:22.836
That sounds important.

08:22.919 --> 08:25.005
I'll teach it to you.

08:25.088 --> 08:26.673
Thank you.

08:26.756 --> 08:28.633
Thank you.

08:30.427 --> 08:32.220
Aloha.

08:33.679 --> 08:35.807
Oh, Jesus.

08:36.515 --> 08:38.393
Look, the reason I called

08:38.477 --> 08:40.395
is 'cause Titus... Dang!

08:40.479 --> 08:41.520
Lick it.

08:41.604 --> 08:42.813
What's your deal?

08:42.897 --> 08:45.233
You're like a cartoon person.

08:45.317 --> 08:49.363
Honestly, I don't even really
want money from Ronald.

08:49.446 --> 08:51.406
I just want him to apologize.

08:51.490 --> 08:53.825
This might make me seem like a fool,
Kimmy,

08:53.908 --> 08:55.702
but we loved each other.

08:55.785 --> 08:57.204
I know we did.

08:57.287 --> 08:59.914
<i>I mean, I knew he liked men.</i>

08:59.998 --> 09:02.542
<i>With Tim Meadows...</i>

09:02.625 --> 09:05.003
<i>But he knew I liked skinny white boys.</i>

09:05.086 --> 09:07.881
<i>...David Spade.</i>

09:07.964 --> 09:13.136
<i>Musical guest: Hootie & the Blowfish.</i>

09:13.220 --> 09:16.723
Neither of us could live our truth
in Chickasaw County.

09:16.806 --> 09:20.477
So I thought,
"We gonna live our lie together."

09:20.560 --> 09:23.522
But that night, our wedding night,

09:23.604 --> 09:26.191
when they realized Ronald ran away,

09:26.274 --> 09:28.902
every one of his five aunties
that raised him

09:28.985 --> 09:30.278
had a heart attack.

09:32.155 --> 09:36.243
<i>And he left me on that dance floor, alone,</i>

09:36.326 --> 09:41.039
<i>with no choice but to Robocop
my way to the car.</i>

09:41.122 --> 09:42.499
That's terrible.

09:42.582 --> 09:45.960
Ronald Wilkerson
would have never done that to me.

09:46.044 --> 09:48.796
That was your friend Titus.

09:48.880 --> 09:50.507
I don't even recognize that man.

09:50.590 --> 09:53.176
For what it's worth, he did get
cheek implants that slipped.

09:53.260 --> 09:54.802
You're the new me.

09:54.886 --> 09:57.764
Look at you right now,
trying to clean up his mess.

09:57.847 --> 10:00.517
But once there's nothing else
that Titus can get from you,

10:00.600 --> 10:03.019
he will leave you
with an unpaid dental bill

10:03.103 --> 10:05.813
and a refrigerator
full of spoiled wedding shrimp.

10:07.148 --> 10:08.442
Watch your back.

10:08.525 --> 10:10.026
And wash your arm, baby.

10:10.110 --> 10:12.779
Oh.

10:14.489 --> 10:15.823
Why are you late?

10:15.907 --> 10:17.909
Why did Mr. Lawyer
call an emergency meeting?

10:17.992 --> 10:19.369
Did Vonda do this?

10:19.453 --> 10:22.122
Titus, the way you bailed on her,

10:22.205 --> 10:23.998
have you ever done that to anyone else?

10:24.082 --> 10:25.750
A Sam Goody credit card.

10:25.833 --> 10:27.710
My college football scholarship.

10:27.794 --> 10:30.838
My cousin who got handsomer than me...
Stupid Darius.

10:30.922 --> 10:33.592
Also, I'm not gonna pay this lawyer.

10:33.674 --> 10:37.220
Well, I've got good news,
and I've got bad news.

10:37.304 --> 10:39.031
The bad news is,
Instagram canceled my account

10:39.055 --> 10:40.348
due to lack of interest.

10:40.432 --> 10:42.309
The good news is that

10:42.392 --> 10:46.480
in 2008, Ronald Wilkerson was declared
legally dead...

10:46.563 --> 10:48.189
by this woman!

10:49.190 --> 10:51.109
He'd been missing ten years.

10:51.192 --> 10:52.777
With his diet, I was being generous.

10:52.860 --> 10:53.778
Sick burn.

10:53.861 --> 10:54.779
However,

10:54.862 --> 10:57.240
you did collect Mr. Wilkerson's
Social Security earnings,

10:57.324 --> 10:59.826
as well as the money
from an insurance policy

10:59.909 --> 11:01.578
he took out on his legs.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.037
I was inspired by Mary Hart

11:03.121 --> 11:05.332
to insure my assets at that time.

11:05.415 --> 11:09.252
So because "Ronald Wilkerson" is dead,
Ms. Brooks, you can't sue him.

11:09.336 --> 11:12.130
As a matter of fact,
you may owe him about $500.

11:12.213 --> 11:13.714
- What?
- What?

11:13.798 --> 11:14.858
Well, I think we're done here.

11:14.882 --> 11:15.800
Boom, bitch!

11:15.883 --> 11:17.760
Bye!

11:17.844 --> 11:19.304
I am not the one.

11:19.387 --> 11:21.139
See you in the funny papers,
Country Mouse.

11:21.222 --> 11:23.933
You better call Jennifer Love Hewitt
and Phil Rizzuto,

11:24.017 --> 11:26.311
because you owe a ghost money.

11:26.394 --> 11:28.687
Okay? Unh, unh, unh!

11:30.565 --> 11:31.650
Unh!

11:31.732 --> 11:33.692
Good luck with that, Kimmy.

11:36.237 --> 11:38.448
Lillian,
do you think Titus would ever do to us

11:38.532 --> 11:40.450
what he did to Vonda?

11:40.534 --> 11:43.578
Chew up crackers and pretend
to throw up on us after prom

11:43.662 --> 11:45.288
to get out of sex?

11:45.372 --> 11:48.833
I could see it happening, yes.

11:48.916 --> 11:50.544
But who cares?

11:50.627 --> 11:51.710
We're going out.

11:51.794 --> 11:54.631
We're gonna get more phone numbers
than the NSA.

11:54.713 --> 11:55.756
Political!

11:55.840 --> 11:56.883
Yes! Right.

11:56.966 --> 11:58.218
Let's go life.

11:58.301 --> 11:59.886
Oh, wait, I need something in here.

12:01.054 --> 12:03.640
Oh, I'll be in Intimates.

12:03.722 --> 12:05.850
Hi, I need a box of silverfish poison.

12:05.933 --> 12:08.478
No, sir, ma'am.
That guy is buy the last one.

12:09.563 --> 12:10.689
Kimmy?

12:10.771 --> 12:12.106
Dong.

12:14.401 --> 12:15.818
You look well.

12:15.902 --> 12:17.696
It's so nice to see you.

12:17.778 --> 12:19.280
I'd like that.

12:19.364 --> 12:20.781
How is your wife?

12:20.865 --> 12:21.782
Still Sonja?

12:21.866 --> 12:23.535
Yes, thank you.

12:23.618 --> 12:25.953
Sonja and I are having people over
for brunch tomorrow,

12:26.037 --> 12:27.914
and the silverfish ate all our towels.

12:27.997 --> 12:30.166
Wow, your English is getting really well.

12:30.250 --> 12:31.334
Thank you.

12:31.418 --> 12:32.687
I didn't have you to help me anymore,

12:32.711 --> 12:34.212
so I started watching a lot of...

12:34.295 --> 12:36.339
<i>Keeping Up with the Kardashians.</i>

12:36.423 --> 12:37.632
Well, it's working.

12:37.716 --> 12:39.050
Aw, you're sweet.

12:39.133 --> 12:40.427
Dong?

12:40.510 --> 12:41.760
My God.

12:41.844 --> 12:44.222
You should come roller-skating with us.

12:44.305 --> 12:45.932
What? Lillian, no.

12:46.015 --> 12:48.101
Everyone knows you can't skate
as a threesies.

12:48.184 --> 12:49.352
Shut up.

12:49.436 --> 12:52.146
As luck would have it,
we'll be a foursome.

12:52.230 --> 12:55.024
I just ran into my old flame, Bobby.

12:55.108 --> 12:57.235
Okay, hi-hi.

13:00.071 --> 13:03.533
I think Dong probably needs to get back
to his <i>wife, </i> Lillian.

13:03.617 --> 13:06.494
Actually, Sonja's at her
Bikram hot yogurt class,

13:06.578 --> 13:08.580
and I do have to stay out of the apartment

13:08.663 --> 13:11.458
for seven hours
after I set off the silverfish bomb.

13:11.541 --> 13:14.335
So, yeah, that sounds amazing.

13:14.419 --> 13:15.336
Well, perfect.

13:15.420 --> 13:17.380
We'll be a foursome.

13:17.464 --> 13:19.549
Come on.

13:21.760 --> 13:24.679
I want this.

13:24.763 --> 13:27.599
Like you do.

13:27.682 --> 13:30.226
You're right. I'm wrong.

13:31.852 --> 13:33.772
<i>♪ You can feel it ♪</i>

13:33.854 --> 13:34.855

13:34.939 --> 13:36.139

13:36.190 --> 13:37.734

13:40.570 --> 13:41.738
Why are you doing the...

13:41.820 --> 13:42.905
white idiot

13:42.989 --> 13:44.658
wedding dance...

13:46.033 --> 13:48.035
White idiot?

13:48.119 --> 13:51.331
Oh, my corn god.

13:54.917 --> 13:56.503
So a brunch, huh?

13:56.586 --> 13:58.045
That's <i>Frasier </i> fancy.

13:58.129 --> 14:00.423
It's just to impress
the immigration officer.

14:00.507 --> 14:03.426
Sonja and I have to be believably married
for two years,

14:03.510 --> 14:05.970
and then I'll be a real American
and get divorced.

14:06.971 --> 14:08.889
Let's talk about something else.

14:08.973 --> 14:10.558
Mm, I think Khloé

14:10.642 --> 14:12.686
is probably the smartest
of the Kardashians

14:12.769 --> 14:14.771
'cause, like, she makes the most sense.

14:14.853 --> 14:16.230
I've never seen their show.

14:16.314 --> 14:17.774
I just know that Kim is a butt star

14:17.856 --> 14:19.442
and married a rapper who hates college.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.754
And Kourtney finally ended
her destructive relationship with Scott.

14:21.778 --> 14:24.155
Meanwhile, Kim's firing back at the haters

14:24.238 --> 14:26.032
with a naked pregnancy selfie.

14:26.115 --> 14:27.867
Wait, how do I know all this?

14:27.950 --> 14:29.494
I saw it on the regular news.

14:29.577 --> 14:30.953
Duh.

14:31.037 --> 14:33.832
Your eyes look so pretty
in the disco lights.

14:33.914 --> 14:35.375
What?

14:35.458 --> 14:37.669
Oh, looking good, Red.

14:37.752 --> 14:40.296
Lillian, how is this helping me?

14:40.380 --> 14:41.673
I need to find a new boyfriend.

14:41.756 --> 14:43.007
Dong is married.

14:43.090 --> 14:44.592
Yeah, but it's just a sham marriage

14:44.676 --> 14:46.386
like Titus and Vonda

14:46.469 --> 14:48.596
or Abe Lincoln, Mary Todd.

14:48.680 --> 14:49.889
Political!

14:49.972 --> 14:50.849
It doesn't matter.

14:50.931 --> 14:52.183
Some things are just wrong,

14:52.266 --> 14:53.601
like kissing a married person

14:53.685 --> 14:55.854
or tracing something
and saying you drew it.

14:55.936 --> 14:56.771
Kimmy...

14:57.772 --> 15:00.734
We have a wonderful thing here in New York

15:00.817 --> 15:02.777
called moral relativism.

15:02.861 --> 15:05.279
Where you're from, in the Midwest,

15:05.363 --> 15:08.533
people say, "I'll never cheat on my wife,"

15:08.616 --> 15:10.243
or, "I'm not gay.

15:10.326 --> 15:11.703
I'm a wrestling coach."

15:11.786 --> 15:13.663
And then one day, boof,

15:13.747 --> 15:15.289
the wheels come off,

15:15.373 --> 15:18.292
they do it all in one weekend,
and drop dead.

15:18.376 --> 15:19.878
Here, we say,

15:19.960 --> 15:22.922
"Eh, so I kissed a priest
in a leather bar.

15:23.005 --> 15:24.382
Who am I hurting?"

15:24.465 --> 15:26.133
No, I don't like that.

15:26.217 --> 15:27.927
What a disaster.

15:28.010 --> 15:31.765
If you want the sandwich,
take the sandwich, of course.

15:31.848 --> 15:34.308
Okay, bye-bye.

15:34.392 --> 15:37.353
Right, wrong, ehh.

15:38.646 --> 15:39.898
Ooh. Oh.

15:40.022 --> 15:41.775
Ooh.

15:43.651 --> 15:45.695
You have so many more bones than Sonja.

15:45.779 --> 15:48.197
I used to eat a lot of powdered milk.

15:51.451 --> 15:53.745
Okay, bye. Have a nice life.

16:03.212 --> 16:04.839
I can't believe you lied to me.

16:04.923 --> 16:08.008
I'm sorry, but we don't know what to do
with you anymore.

16:08.092 --> 16:11.262
Two silo explosions? How?

16:11.345 --> 16:13.025
If I knew,
it wouldn't have happened twice.

16:13.055 --> 16:15.308
Jackie Lynn, our town can't afford this.

16:15.391 --> 16:17.351
We have so little money as it is.

16:17.435 --> 16:19.604
The elders are having a sweat tonight

16:19.687 --> 16:22.857
to pray for a resolution
to the Jackie Lynn situation.

16:22.941 --> 16:23.817
- I want to go.
- No.

16:23.900 --> 16:25.443
Stay away from the sweat lodge.

16:25.526 --> 16:28.655
Jackie Lynn,
you belong to another tribe now.

16:28.738 --> 16:30.156
What does that mean?

16:30.239 --> 16:32.617
Maybe you should go back to New York.

16:32.700 --> 16:36.245
Well... okay.

16:36.329 --> 16:38.873
If that's the way you feel.

16:40.917 --> 16:41.835
Pew-pew! Pew!

16:41.918 --> 16:43.210
What are you doing?

16:43.294 --> 16:44.796
I'm shooting nightmares at you.

16:44.879 --> 16:46.380
That's not how it works.

16:46.464 --> 16:48.883
- Oh.
- An <i>ihanbla gmunka.</i>

16:48.967 --> 16:50.760
It symbolizes connectivity.

16:50.844 --> 16:52.804
If even one thread breaks,

16:52.887 --> 16:54.472
everything falls apart.

16:54.555 --> 16:56.056
It's like you, Jackie Lynn.

16:56.140 --> 16:58.142
You need to mend your web.

16:58.225 --> 17:00.561
But your connections
are back in Manhattan.

17:00.645 --> 17:03.564
Nothing I ever do is good enough
for this family.

17:03.648 --> 17:05.273
I feel like Rob Kardashian!

17:05.358 --> 17:06.859
The sock designer?

17:06.943 --> 17:08.402
Why do I know that?

17:19.288 --> 17:22.375
Driver, just go around the block
a few times.

17:23.835 --> 17:26.337
Oh. Right.

17:27.839 --> 17:29.883
No.

17:29.966 --> 17:32.844
No. No.

17:32.927 --> 17:35.346
The prisoner locks.

17:37.264 --> 17:40.018
It's like a sweat lodge in here.

17:40.100 --> 17:42.144
Help!

17:42.228 --> 17:43.813
Help!

17:43.897 --> 17:45.690
Coffee!

17:45.773 --> 17:47.400
Coffee!

17:47.483 --> 17:48.776
White idiot!

17:50.110 --> 17:51.362
White idiot.

17:52.488 --> 17:54.198
<i>♪ Pizza party for one ♪</i>

17:54.281 --> 17:56.200
<i>♪ Divorced, dead, and having some fun ♪</i>

17:56.283 --> 17:58.077
<i>♪ Pizza party for one ♪</i>

17:58.160 --> 17:59.620
I don't have pizza.

18:00.997 --> 18:02.248
What's wrong, Kim Blake Nelson?

18:02.331 --> 18:04.042
I don't know, Titus. What is wrong?

18:04.124 --> 18:05.209
And what's right?

18:05.292 --> 18:07.587
And what's just... ehh?

18:07.670 --> 18:09.463
I find that life is mostly gray areas,

18:09.547 --> 18:12.008
especially the parts I can't reach
with moisturizer.

18:12.091 --> 18:12.926
Uh-huh.

18:13.009 --> 18:16.012
Is that why you thought it was okay
to be so mean to Vonda?

18:16.095 --> 18:17.280
I don't know what you're referring to,

18:17.304 --> 18:18.598
because in the movie I saw,

18:18.681 --> 18:20.474
I was a hero scoring a legal victory

18:20.558 --> 18:22.309
for young run-a-gays everywhere.

18:22.393 --> 18:24.395
You couldn't even apologize to her.

18:24.478 --> 18:26.940
There are three things Titus Andromedon
does not do:

18:27.023 --> 18:29.067
apologies, drag, and calculus.

18:29.149 --> 18:31.003
I'm beginning to think
maybe you were a better person

18:31.027 --> 18:33.153
back when you were Ronald Wilkerson.

18:33.237 --> 18:35.448
Well, we'll never know
'cause Ronald Wilkerson's dead.

18:35.531 --> 18:39.035
Oh, you are just Mr. Sassafras Jeans
today.

18:39.118 --> 18:42.329
That's a dumb name for how fierce
I'm being right now.

18:42.413 --> 18:43.581
I want to talk to Ronald.

18:43.664 --> 18:44.791
What?

18:44.874 --> 18:45.875
He was good and nice,

18:45.959 --> 18:47.460
and he's still in there somewhere.

18:47.543 --> 18:49.045
I have many past lives inside me.

18:49.128 --> 18:50.671
- I want to talk to Ronald.
- No!

18:50.755 --> 18:53.340
Titus Andromedon, let me speak to Ronald!

18:53.424 --> 18:54.801
Ronald no want to talk, please.

18:54.884 --> 18:56.636
That was Murasaki. I'll explain her later.

18:56.719 --> 18:58.972
Ronald, you loved Vonda.

18:59.055 --> 19:00.407
Leave us alone, lassie!

19:00.431 --> 19:02.516
Ooh, who was that?

19:02.600 --> 19:04.310
Ow. Aah!

19:04.393 --> 19:07.187
I... I...

19:07.271 --> 19:10.357
I sure didn't want to hurt Vonda Jeanne.

19:10.441 --> 19:12.944
I was scared to face her.

19:13.027 --> 19:14.862
What if she wouldn't accept my apology?

19:14.946 --> 19:16.030
Shut up, Ronald, you nerd.

19:16.114 --> 19:17.406
See?

19:17.490 --> 19:18.616
I knew it.

19:18.699 --> 19:20.910
You need to embrace your Ronald, Titus.

19:20.994 --> 19:22.120
For why?

19:22.202 --> 19:24.330
For me. I'm your Vonda now.

19:24.413 --> 19:26.791
How do I know you won't just pack up
and run away from me?

19:26.874 --> 19:28.084
Because I probably won't.

19:28.167 --> 19:31.420
Now, can I please eat
my ham and clam pizza in peace?

19:31.504 --> 19:32.839
That's wrong.

19:32.922 --> 19:34.507
Those toppings are wrong.

19:34.590 --> 19:36.300
I will agree with you in 20 minutes.

19:36.383 --> 19:37.802
But it doesn't matter, does it?

19:37.885 --> 19:39.178
'Cause this is New York,

19:39.261 --> 19:41.430
where everyone's moral relatives.

19:41.514 --> 19:43.641
Just order a deep-dish ham/clam,

19:43.724 --> 19:45.434
and some sicko will make it for you.

19:45.518 --> 19:46.954
I'll have you know I didn't order these.

19:46.978 --> 19:48.312
I found them.

19:48.395 --> 19:49.414
Am I the only person in this city

19:49.438 --> 19:52.859
who doesn't just do whatevs whenevs?

19:52.942 --> 19:54.443
Well, fudge that sugar.

19:54.527 --> 19:55.820
Fudge it to heck,

19:55.903 --> 19:57.530
where a demon with a thousand wee-wees

19:57.613 --> 19:58.698
fudges it forever!

19:58.781 --> 20:00.658
I'm crashing Dong's brunch!

20:07.707 --> 20:10.209
I'm sweating like an Indian in here.

20:10.292 --> 20:13.337
It's okay. I can say that.

20:13.420 --> 20:15.464
I can say that.

20:19.177 --> 20:22.638
Jackie Lynn, the hoop symbolizes unity.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.348
I'm visioning.

20:24.431 --> 20:26.893
We have so little money as it is.

20:27.768 --> 20:29.645
Your house is that way, dummy.

20:29.729 --> 20:32.023
You belong to a different tribe now.

20:32.106 --> 20:33.399
Boogie oogie, oogie.

20:33.482 --> 20:36.610
Corn god. You are corn-lectric.

20:36.694 --> 20:38.112
Just use your contacts.

20:38.196 --> 20:40.280
Your connections are back in Manhattan.

20:40.364 --> 20:41.532
In Manhattan...

20:41.615 --> 20:43.409
How am I still a thing?

20:43.492 --> 20:44.636
- <i>Connections.
- Back in Manhattan.</i>

20:44.660 --> 20:45.953
Lacrosse is our thing.

20:46.037 --> 20:47.538
Contacts, contacts, contacts.

20:47.621 --> 20:50.791
I know what I have to do!

20:55.004 --> 20:56.172
Kimmy!

20:56.255 --> 20:58.925
It's Sonja from GED class?

20:59.008 --> 21:02.302
Also, the cartoon <i>Anastasia </i> is about me.

21:02.386 --> 21:03.303
Of course. Sonja.

21:03.387 --> 21:04.555
Hello.

21:04.638 --> 21:07.141
Kimmy is our best friend.

21:07.225 --> 21:08.267
Oh.

21:08.350 --> 21:09.643
Were you at their wedding?

21:09.727 --> 21:10.937
Well, I wanted to be,

21:11.020 --> 21:12.897
but these two lovebirds eloped.

21:12.980 --> 21:14.774
I'm not a bird today.

21:14.857 --> 21:16.943
Kimmy.

21:17.026 --> 21:18.111
- What are you...
- Listen.

21:18.194 --> 21:20.113
I need to talk to you in private.

21:21.239 --> 21:22.489
What are you doing here?

21:22.573 --> 21:24.617
Lookit, we had fun last night, right?

21:24.700 --> 21:26.285
Yeah. But then things got weird.

21:26.368 --> 21:27.679
Like when Kourtney squirted

21:27.703 --> 21:29.496
her breast milk on Kim's psoriasis.

21:29.580 --> 21:30.998
Why do I know about that?

21:31.082 --> 21:32.125
Here's the thing:

21:32.208 --> 21:33.751
there are gray areas in life.

21:33.834 --> 21:35.128
Sonja's is enormous.

21:35.211 --> 21:37.213
Look, I know we both want to do
the right thing,

21:37.296 --> 21:39.066
but I also can't wait anymore
for my life to...

21:39.090 --> 21:40.925
- Stop.
- ...start.

21:41.008 --> 21:42.718
Dead silverfish.

21:45.846 --> 21:47.640
I guess the poison's working.

21:47.723 --> 21:49.725
Oh, now there's one in your hair.

21:49.809 --> 21:51.018
Hang on.

22:02.280 --> 22:03.489
Kimmy, no.

22:03.572 --> 22:04.572
We can't do this.

22:04.615 --> 22:05.634
Look, I'm from the Midwest.

22:05.658 --> 22:07.160
I believe in the sanctity of marr...

22:08.828 --> 22:10.370
Silverfish.

22:11.580 --> 22:13.558
But I also want to rub my mouth
on your mouth so I don't boof.

22:13.582 --> 22:14.708
Stop it.

22:14.792 --> 22:16.961
All I want is not to be deported.
That's it.

22:17.044 --> 22:18.378
What about last night?

22:18.462 --> 22:19.922
Last night was a mistake.

22:20.006 --> 22:21.674
Lillian's hair looked like noodles.

22:21.757 --> 22:22.967
I got caught up in it.

22:23.050 --> 22:26.095
What if the immigration lady
was also super into roller-skating?

22:26.179 --> 22:27.387
I could have lost everything.

22:27.471 --> 22:29.473
- But...
- I think you should leave.

22:35.980 --> 22:38.440
Maybe I'll see you in two years, then?

22:48.617 --> 22:50.536
Titus, what are you doing?

22:50.619 --> 22:53.122
Wow, so one fight and you're out of here?

22:53.206 --> 22:55.291
I've lost my job, my boyfriend,

22:55.373 --> 22:57.293
my favorite scrunchie, and now you?

22:57.375 --> 22:59.295
I don't want to talk about this, Kimmy.

22:59.377 --> 23:01.588
I'm being dramatical.

23:01.672 --> 23:03.341
Fine. Go ahead.

23:03.423 --> 23:06.552
Just run away from your problems...
again.

23:07.427 --> 23:10.056
You can't keep running away
forever, Titus.

23:11.015 --> 23:13.517
Oh, I will keep following you.

23:14.768 --> 23:16.896
You know I'm right!

23:16.979 --> 23:20.358
Your guilt will chase you wherever you go.

23:22.860 --> 23:24.820
You can't escape, Titus!

23:24.904 --> 23:26.697
Has the train to Biloxi left yet?

23:26.780 --> 23:28.532
Nope. It's running two hours late.

23:28.615 --> 23:29.700
Vonda!

23:29.783 --> 23:31.409
Wait!

23:31.493 --> 23:33.120
Wait. Vonda?

23:35.581 --> 23:38.542
Boy, good thing the train was late.

23:38.625 --> 23:41.379
Ha. You think we're a train company?

23:41.461 --> 23:42.755
We run late on purpose

23:42.838 --> 23:45.383
so people can find each other
in romantical fashion.

23:45.465 --> 23:47.718
Amtrak... is for lovers.

23:50.846 --> 23:52.639
Phillip?

23:52.723 --> 23:54.808
Sheila.

24:01.857 --> 24:04.360
Vonda... I'm sorry.

24:04.442 --> 24:07.363
The friendship we had was deep and real,

24:07.445 --> 24:09.489
and I should've never abandoned you
that way.

24:09.573 --> 24:11.491
Maybe that's why I never called,

24:11.575 --> 24:15.413
'cause I was afraid to hear
how much I had hurt you.

24:15.495 --> 24:17.290
But if you'll have me,

24:17.373 --> 24:18.916
I'd like to be your friend...

24:18.999 --> 24:20.458
without benefits.

24:20.542 --> 24:22.295
I'd like that.

24:25.631 --> 24:28.968
And now, I'd like to pay you back

24:29.051 --> 24:31.595
a little of what I owe you.

24:38.227 --> 24:40.478
Ladies and gentlemen,

24:40.562 --> 24:43.399
for the first time anywhere,

24:43.481 --> 24:48.112
Ms. and Mr. Vonda Jeanne Brooks

24:48.195 --> 24:52.950
and Titus Ronald
Wilkerson-Andromedon-Yoshimura.

24:53.033 --> 24:54.785
I'll explain that later.
