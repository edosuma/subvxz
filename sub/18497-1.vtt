Okay, I'll go. But this package
came to my house for you, Willie.

05:02.160 --> 05:04.811
There's a lot of money in it.
And a phone.

05:04.880 --> 05:05.961

Goddamn. Are you

05:26.760 --> 05:30.685
No. The Hungry Hoagies people tested me.
I'm top of the spectrum.

05:30.760 --> 05:32.922
So they made me
a full-time sandwich consultant.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.527
- Well, I'm glad you followed your passion.
- What's that smell?

05:37.240 --> 05:40.130
Is the oven on?
Are you making Hot Pockets?

05:40.200 --> 05:42.328
We do hot sandwiches
at Hungry Hoagies now.

05:42.400 --> 05:44.641

06:56.120 --> 06:58.361
Or did you get carpal tunnel

06:58.480 --> 07:02.326
- I can crack just fine, thanks.

- What associate?
- I'm not at liberty to disclose just yet.

07:18.520 --> 07:20.090
But they know your work.

07:20.160 --> 07:24.085
And they want to bring us in and put us up

07:24.160 --> 07:25.650

07:54.160 --> 07:55.496

08:05.320 --> 08:09.211

- Am I gonna what?

08:13.480 --> 08:14.766
No! Fuck no!

08:15.680 --> 08:18.365
But you said that when I was 21
that you'd pop my cherry.

08:18.440 --> 08:21.364
I said I'd get it done by somebody else.

or an animal or anything.

08:34.919 --> 08:36.570
No, I waited for you.

- But surely, you jerked off or...
- You mean masturbate, don't you?

yeah, I guess so.

Okay, so here's how it's gonna go down.
He's already asked me where his cherry is.

09:08.240 --> 09:10.686
So you could tell him
to put his dick in your purse

09:10.760 --> 09:12.728
and he wouldn't know
any fucking difference.

09:12.800 --> 09:14.882
It's gonna be the easiest 20 bucks
you ever made.

09:14.960 --> 09:17.645
Twenty bucks?

09:17.720 --> 09:19.722
You must be high
on some strong shit, Willie.

09:19.800 --> 09:23.122
A hundred. Or I'm gonna carry my ass
outta this old piece of a room right now.

09:23.200 --> 09:25.646
All right.
Fifty, or I'll just go get your mother.

09:26.840 --> 09:27.841
Sixty.

09:28.640 --> 09:29.641
All right.

09:29.720 --> 09:32.326
And nothing up my ass.
You done took all that, Willie.

09:32.400 --> 09:33.447
Okay.

09:33.520 --> 09:36.444
Well, let's get to it.
I gotta pick up my grandson from ballet.

09:36.520 --> 09:38.921
- Can I fix you a sandwich?
- No.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.844
- I got your sandwich, baby.
- Willie, I made you a sandwich.

09:41.920 --> 09:44.844
I ain't sticking around.
Just give it to Opal after.

09:44.920 --> 09:46.410
Now, listen, here's how it works.

09:46.520 --> 09:49.683
She's gonna pull her rig off.
And she's gonna get on all fours.

09:49.760 --> 09:53.003
Now, you stand behind her
and drop your rig.

09:53.080 --> 09:56.846
Then, you're gonna see something that
looks like some kind of Japanese food.

09:56.920 --> 10:00.003
It ain't, so don't eat it.
That's the bulls-eye.

10:00.120 --> 10:02.771
Then you just start tugging
on your little soldier.

10:02.840 --> 10:05.411
Wait till he gets to attention,
then poke him in there.

10:05.480 --> 10:08.051
Keep poking it in there till he spits up.

10:08.120 --> 10:09.336
You're gonna need a raincoat.

10:09.360 --> 10:11.727
She'll have one,
so don't worry about that.

10:11.840 --> 10:15.242
As soon as you're done,
run to the bathroom, wash your crotch.

10:15.320 --> 10:18.688
That way, you don't wake up wondering
why you got oatmeal in your carpet.

10:18.760 --> 10:21.206
Breathe through your mouth
so that you don't puke.

10:21.280 --> 10:24.887
Shouldn't be a problem for you.
You got it?

10:24.960 --> 10:27.406
- You got 60 bucks?
- No.

10:27.520 --> 10:29.329
- What you got?
<i>- I</i> have $20.

10:29.440 --> 10:30.771
Keep it down.

10:31.560 --> 10:35.167
- I have 20.
- Give it to her after.

10:36.760 --> 10:38.888
- Later, Opal.
- Mm-hmm.

Hold the fucking phone.

12:06.000 --> 12:09.721
I traveled all the way across the country
to rob a goddamn charity?

12:09.800 --> 12:11.450
Why? You got a problem with that?

12:11.520 --> 12:13.602
Yeah, you damn right
I got a problem with it.

12:15.600 --> 12:17.568
No way these assholes
have 2 million bucks.

12:17.640 --> 12:20.291
Will you keep it down, man. Moron.

12:21.080 --> 12:22.206
I don't know.

12:25.760 --> 12:29.287
- I see they made you some chairs already.
- Fuck you.

12:34.280 --> 12:37.045
He's Cook. I'm Davis.
We're here for the orientation.

12:37.960 --> 12:41.169
Empty your pockets.
Place any metal items in the tray.

12:44.840 --> 12:47.207
What's that?

12:48.440 --> 12:50.283
- Cough medicine.
- Let me see that.

12:55.920 --> 12:59.288
That's a level three contraband.
I'm gonna have to compensate that.

12:59.360 --> 13:00.885
The fuck you are.

13:00.960 --> 13:04.806
All right, big shot.
You can stay out here with your GD flask.

13:04.880 --> 13:07.929
- We'll get it on the way out.
- Gina!

13:08.000 --> 13:09.896
Show these boys to the line-up.
They're late.

13:09.920 --> 13:12.287
Meeting started ten minutes ago.

13:12.360 --> 13:14.761
But I think I can sneak you guys in.
Come on.

13:28.200 --> 13:32.046
- Hey, Diane! I got two more.
- Come on in, fellas.

13:32.120 --> 13:34.600
- Goddamn.
- That's Diane Hastings.

13:34.680 --> 13:36.170
She and her husband run the joint.

13:36.240 --> 13:38.536
So like I was saying,
finish filling out these forms

13:38.560 --> 13:41.370
and you can drop them off
at the front desk, please.

13:41.440 --> 13:44.250
And then, you can go to the common room
and pick up your uniforms.

13:44.320 --> 13:47.085
I bet that pussy got lips
like an orangutan.

13:48.880 --> 13:52.771
- Excuse me, Mr...
- Um, Cook. Randall Cook.

13:52.840 --> 13:55.730
- What's up?
- Have you been drinking?

13:56.760 --> 13:59.491
Uh, I don't know. Some vodka...

13:59.560 --> 14:02.769
Because we don't allow alcohol
or drugs of any kind at Giving City.

14:02.840 --> 14:03.921
Why's that?

14:04.000 --> 14:08.403
You may not be aware of this, Mr. Cook,
but we're a charity.

14:08.480 --> 14:10.496
When you walk out those doors,
you're representing us.

14:10.520 --> 14:14.445
- So please try and make us look good.
- Oh, we'll make you look great.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.602
- Promise.
- Yeah.

14:17.960 --> 14:19.166
Mmm.

14:20.680 --> 14:21.681
A hard-on?

14:21.760 --> 14:23.125
You sick fuck.

14:23.200 --> 14:25.248
I'm the one that's been in prison
for ten years.

14:25.320 --> 14:27.766
It's just a semi.
Don't get all bent out of shape.

14:27.840 --> 14:29.410
Shut the fuck up.

14:29.480 --> 14:31.289
Ho, ho, ho. What's up, Santas?

14:31.360 --> 14:32.771
Hey, don't forget to remind people,

14:32.840 --> 14:35.296
if they don't have cash,
they can always text in their donation.

14:35.320 --> 14:37.368
Give me some. Yeah.

14:37.480 --> 14:39.687
Hey, Di. Is it the midget
that's fully proportional?

14:39.760 --> 14:41.256
- Or is it the dwarf?
- Regent.

14:41.280 --> 14:42.456
- What?
- You can't say that word.

14:42.480 --> 14:44.482
Hey, I'm gonna be home
late again tonight.

14:44.560 --> 14:46.528
End-of-the-year accounting stuff.

14:46.600 --> 14:48.329
See you, babe.

14:49.120 --> 14:50.816
Thank you
for helping us out again.

14:50.840 --> 14:52.683
Goddamn it.

14:52.760 --> 14:54.410
Sir? This way, please.

14:54.480 --> 14:56.801
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I get it.
Don't be touching me.

14:56.880 --> 14:59.360
- Merry Christmas.
- Yeah, whatever.

14:59.440 --> 15:00.771
Lying little fuck.

15:00.840 --> 15:03.366
You didn't tell me I'd have to get
in the fucking suit again.

15:03.440 --> 15:07.286
I thought it would be a bonus.
And I just wanna remind you of something.

15:07.360 --> 15:10.728
It's Christmas.
A time for forgiveness. For family.

15:10.800 --> 15:12.564
I'm gonna remind you to fuck yourself.

15:12.680 --> 15:15.365
Ronald Davis.
I was told you have a suit to fit me.

15:15.440 --> 15:18.444
Oh, yes. I have it right here.

15:19.480 --> 15:23.451
No. I need a Santa suit.
This is an elf suit.

15:23.520 --> 15:25.124
I'm supposed to be a Santa.

15:25.200 --> 15:28.761
Oh, sorry about the confusion.
That's all we have in your size.

15:28.840 --> 15:35.200
Uh, I do have a gingerbread man costume
in a child's large, if you prefer.

15:35.280 --> 15:36.770
I guess there is a God.

15:36.840 --> 15:38.729
Step right up. Don't be shy.

15:38.800 --> 15:42.850
Shitstick! What's it been?
Fifteen years? Twen...

15:45.200 --> 15:50.411
Well, one thing hasn't changed.
You still hit like your fucking father.

15:50.480 --> 15:54.041
Fucking <i>associate.</i> No goddamn way.

15:55.520 --> 15:58.603
Not working with that poison bitch.
Never again.

15:58.680 --> 16:00.808
You tricked me, you little shithole!

16:00.880 --> 16:02.120
You know fucking well you did.

16:02.160 --> 16:04.401
But I thought your dad
was the one you hated.

16:04.480 --> 16:08.007
I hate him more than anything
in the goddamn world! Except her.

16:09.800 --> 16:11.689
Willie, stop! Willie!

16:12.760 --> 16:15.730
Okay, shitstick, just give me back
the money for the train ticket,

16:15.800 --> 16:16.881
then we're square.

16:16.960 --> 16:20.851
Or you could do your dumb-ass self a favor,
at least hear me out before you quit.

16:25.760 --> 16:28.411
Boy, you been selling
your blood for booze?

16:28.560 --> 16:32.121
You look like a fucking albino scarecrow.

16:32.200 --> 16:35.568
Anyway, still good to see you.

16:35.680 --> 16:37.842
Uh, I can't say I feel the same.

16:39.880 --> 16:42.326
Goddamn, what a shit hole.

16:42.400 --> 16:45.131
- You conned me, you little prick.
- Fuck you!

16:45.200 --> 16:48.090
Make yourselves at home.
Bedroom's mine.

16:48.160 --> 16:51.926
That sofa folds out,
so you guys can fight over that.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.843
I got chicken feet in the fridge.

16:54.600 --> 16:58.650
- So that's what smells like nut sack.
- Boy, have a beer.

17:00.000 --> 17:03.607
- I even got minis for the midget.
- Don't you ever fucking call me that.

17:03.680 --> 17:07.241
Hey, listen, little man,
I don't speak politically correct,

17:07.319 --> 17:10.722
so if you got a problem with that,
you take it up with the Lollipop Guild.

17:10.839 --> 17:14.401
Shut the hell up!
Just break it down for him, Sunny.

17:14.480 --> 17:16.800
I'll break it down, all right.

17:16.880 --> 17:20.089
Giving City is a charity
at 98 cents every dollar

17:20.160 --> 17:22.002
goes to this A-hole at the top.

17:22.079 --> 17:23.605
Regent Hastings.

17:23.680 --> 17:26.762
He takes in tens of thousands
in donations,

17:26.839 --> 17:29.411
and he squirrels them away
in an offshore account.

17:29.480 --> 17:33.929
- And how are you supposed to get it?
- You mean, how are we supposed to get it?

17:34.000 --> 17:38.403
These little buckets here,
they're filled with cash,

17:38.480 --> 17:40.005
up to the brim, every day.

17:40.120 --> 17:44.523
And then at night, they store that cash
in the safe in Regent's office.

17:44.600 --> 17:47.809
And that's our target. Right here.

17:47.920 --> 17:50.241
Christmas Eve,
they have a big charity concert.

17:50.320 --> 17:52.482
So while the kids and volunteers
are all singing,

17:52.560 --> 17:55.723
the money's just sitting there,
waiting for an armored transfer.

17:55.800 --> 18:00.203
That's our take window.
Last year, the haul was almost 2 mil.

18:00.280 --> 18:03.648
- And how do you know all this shit?
- Because I work there, dumb-ass.

18:03.720 --> 18:06.336
It's a part of my release from the joint.
I've been there 3 months.

18:06.360 --> 18:08.647
Just did a little digging,
a little Googling,

18:08.720 --> 18:11.883
a dry hand job to Isaac
in Accounting. Boom.

18:11.960 --> 18:13.883
The concert's in five days.

18:13.960 --> 18:16.804
Meantime, we wear the suit,
hit the pavement,

18:16.880 --> 18:19.016
we ring the bell,
just like the rest of the volunteers.

18:19.040 --> 18:20.326
All right.

18:20.400 --> 18:23.847
Well, it looks to me like you jackals
already got the whole job figured out.

18:23.920 --> 18:26.730
What do you need me for?
You can crack a fucking safe.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.960
Well, I'd like to say
it's because I've missed you, my angel.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.447
But I got a touch of the Parkinson's
and my hearing ain't what it used to be,

18:33.520 --> 18:35.363
so I'm gonna need you on the safe.

18:35.440 --> 18:37.568
Mmm.

18:37.640 --> 18:41.201
And when do you pull your little
Roy Rogers pistol out on me again?

18:41.280 --> 18:44.329
I said I was sorry.
You gotta let that shit go, Willie!

18:44.400 --> 18:46.323
No, I think I'll hang on to it.

18:46.400 --> 18:47.970
Oh, Christ.

18:48.040 --> 18:50.646
If I cut ties with every numbnut
who tried to shoot me,

18:51.040 --> 18:52.576
I never would've gotten pregnant with you.

18:52.600 --> 18:56.605
Come on, boy.
Be just like old times.

18:56.680 --> 18:58.330
- Old times?
- Mm-hmm.

18:58.400 --> 19:01.882
You mean a living fucking nightmare?
Why didn't you say so? I'm in.

19:02.680 --> 19:05.286
You gotta be shitting me.
Good luck with the shakes.

19:05.360 --> 19:09.331
Willie, come on.
Just give it a chance.

19:17.880 --> 19:20.326
What, you don't trust your mother?

19:20.400 --> 19:22.801
Yeah, I trust her
about as far as I can throw you.

19:22.880 --> 19:25.201
And I trust you
about as far as I can throw her.

19:25.280 --> 19:26.930
Come on, Willie, I need this.

19:27.000 --> 19:30.561
And I know your sorry ass does too.
Look at you, man.

19:41.920 --> 19:44.810
Okay, if you want me in on this,
it's you and me against her.

19:44.880 --> 19:46.325
You got it?

19:46.400 --> 19:49.847
She don't get a fucking nickel
of what's in that safe. Get me?

19:49.920 --> 19:53.527
- We'll cut her out after the grab.
- Damn right.

20:00.760 --> 20:05.448
I knew you couldn't stay away.
You always were your mama's boy.

20:05.520 --> 20:08.126
You just pipe down
about the family stuff, okay?

20:08.200 --> 20:10.521
I'm in this for the dough, period.
You get me?

20:10.600 --> 20:13.331
Well, it's starting to feel
like Christmas.

20:14.840 --> 20:17.047
Spare some change.

20:17.120 --> 20:19.930
Think about somebody
besides your fucking selves.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.651
We gotta get eyes on that safe.
Need to know the make.

20:22.720 --> 20:25.291
Now you're asking
the right questions, shitstick.

20:25.360 --> 20:27.408
The trash chute's the best way in.

20:27.480 --> 20:29.216
I'm gonna need a hand
getting into position.

20:29.240 --> 20:31.925
Recon. Good. We'll go tonight.

20:33.080 --> 20:35.242
Look at those cheeks!

20:36.800 --> 20:39.280
That's the ugliest fucking baby
on the planet.

20:39.360 --> 20:42.011
I guess the abortion didn't take.

20:42.080 --> 20:46.483
Well, bless your heart.
Cheap little fucker.

20:46.560 --> 20:48.528
Fucking dimes? Are you shitting me?

20:48.640 --> 20:51.644
- This ain't no strip joint.
- What a fucking Sokes family.

20:51.720 --> 20:54.326
This is what happens
when you screw your cousins.

20:54.440 --> 20:56.522
I taught this muskrat everything he knows.

20:56.600 --> 21:00.400
- Well, you don't know shit, then, do you?
- Hey, listen, before we had midget...

21:01.320 --> 21:04.324
Excuse me... little people, we had Willie.

21:04.400 --> 21:07.643
He was my original elf.
Remember those times, Willie?

21:07.720 --> 21:10.007
There ain't enough booze to forget it.

21:10.120 --> 21:13.329
Well, he'd get panic attacks.
It was embarrassing.

21:13.400 --> 21:17.166
I had to make him stay outside
when I was turning a trick or bowling.

21:17.240 --> 21:20.084
Wait a fucking minute,
you were embarrassed?

21:20.160 --> 21:23.323
Isn't that kind of like the pot
calling the other cot a fuck kettle,

21:23.400 --> 21:25.176
- or whatever it was?
- What the fuck you say?

21:25.200 --> 21:27.567
He's home-schooled.

21:31.840 --> 21:33.365
I need a refill.

21:33.440 --> 21:37.161
- And another fucking corner.
- Stop it, Willie.

21:37.240 --> 21:40.005
What? We're gonna steal this shit
any fucking way. Who cares?

21:40.080 --> 21:42.890
But if we get fired,
we got no access to the building.

21:42.960 --> 21:46.123
And if we got no access to the building,
we got no access to the safe.

21:46.240 --> 21:47.924
And if we got no access to the safe,

21:48.000 --> 21:52.449
there's no reason for me to be standing
out here, freezing my fucking nuts off.

21:52.520 --> 21:54.056
You mean your nuts
haven't been scraped off

21:54.080 --> 21:56.560
because they're so low
to the ground already?

21:56.640 --> 21:58.608
You know every time you're passed out,

21:58.680 --> 22:01.081
I lay them on your forehead
and take a picture of it.

22:01.160 --> 22:04.243
I got a whole Instagram of that shit
of me tea-bagging you.

22:04.320 --> 22:07.847
Four thousand followers and counting,
motherfucker. Ha-ha!

22:09.200 --> 22:11.496
Well, knock yourselves out.
I'm getting the fuck out of here.

22:11.520 --> 22:13.727
Aw, come on,
we're having family time here.

22:13.800 --> 22:17.725
He's always been too goddamn soft.
Probably because he was born early.

22:17.800 --> 22:21.361
Hell, I didn't even know
I'd given birth until I tripped over him.

22:26.800 --> 22:28.848
- Hello.
- Hi, Willie.

22:28.920 --> 22:30.490
Kid, how'd you get my number?

22:30.560 --> 22:31.936
<i>The cherry pop lady
gave it to me.</i>

22:31.960 --> 22:32.961
Oh, Jesus.

22:33.080 --> 22:35.765
I cleaned your apartment, Willie.
And I fed your insects.

22:35.840 --> 22:37.330
They're getting really big.

22:37.400 --> 22:38.976
<i>Do you want me to get you
a Christmas tree?</i>

22:39.000 --> 22:42.288
- What? Why would I want a tree?
- So we can spend Christmas together.

22:42.360 --> 22:44.240
<i>I'm in fucking Chicago, kid.</i>

22:44.920 --> 22:46.520
So you're not coming back for Christmas?

22:46.560 --> 22:50.770
- No, I'm not coming home for Christmas.
- Chicago's in the Midwest, Willie.

22:50.840 --> 22:52.416
<i>They have Hungry Hoagies there too.</i>

22:52.440 --> 22:54.568
Well, good.
I'll tell them you said hello, okay?

22:54.640 --> 22:56.768
Except I don't know anyone
at that Hungry Hoagies.

22:56.840 --> 22:59.096
All right, listen, you gotta quit
fucking calling me, okay?

22:59.120 --> 23:01.691
- You're burning my minutes.
- But what if it's an emergency?

23:01.760 --> 23:03.888
Fine! If it's an emergency,
call me, all right?

23:03.960 --> 23:06.008
Otherwise, leave me the fuck alone, okay?

23:06.080 --> 23:08.128
Okay. I'll only call if it's an emergency.

23:08.760 --> 23:10.330
Bye.

23:13.320 --> 23:19.362
♪ <i>It's the most wonderful time</i>
<i>of the year</i> ♪

23:19.440 --> 23:23.047
Okay, feed the kids.
Come on. Give it up.

23:23.120 --> 23:25.282
You've seen them babies with beer bellies.

23:25.360 --> 23:29.251
Ho, ho! Come on, you got Jesus
and the lambikins watching over you,

23:29.320 --> 23:31.243
checking their list twice.

23:31.320 --> 23:33.527
Here you go, lady,
how about a little money?

23:33.640 --> 23:35.736
You know what,
you'd better hope the orphans don't riot.

23:35.760 --> 23:37.649
They'll eat your fat ass
right off the bat.

23:37.720 --> 23:40.769
You know, a lot of these kids
don't got any arms and legs and shit.

23:40.840 --> 23:42.696
You're lucky. See, ma'am?
Yours got all their parts.

23:42.720 --> 23:45.883
- There you go.
- There you go. Thank you. See you later.

23:45.960 --> 23:47.736
- Damn. Mama ain't bad.
- Whoa!

23:47.760 --> 23:50.650
Whoa-ho-ho! My spot.

23:51.680 --> 23:53.409
You are standing on my spot.

23:53.480 --> 23:56.120
Really? That's funny, I don't see
your fucking name on it anywhere.

23:56.160 --> 23:58.367
Well, in fairness,
I did leave it unattended,

23:58.440 --> 24:01.762
but that's only because
I had to run off to the little boys' room.

24:01.840 --> 24:03.776
What are you,
a fucking game show host or something?

24:03.800 --> 24:06.326
- Dial it back a notch.
- But now I am back.

24:06.400 --> 24:08.846
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!

24:08.920 --> 24:11.048
'Tis the season of giving!

24:11.120 --> 24:15.842
And if you don't have cash,
you can always text XMAS 999...

24:15.920 --> 24:19.208
Bullshit. No fucking way.
Fucking cash only.

24:19.280 --> 24:20.645
- Ten dollars or more.
- Okay.

24:20.720 --> 24:22.256
Hundreds are better. What?

24:22.280 --> 24:24.965
I am going to have to ask you
to watch your language

24:25.040 --> 24:26.690
when you're representing the suit.

24:26.760 --> 24:29.650
And I'm going to have to ask you
to suck my fucking dick.

24:29.720 --> 24:30.801
I'm warning you.

24:30.880 --> 24:35.568
Nothing and no one is getting in the way
of me spreading my joy!

24:35.640 --> 24:36.846
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!

24:36.920 --> 24:39.127
You know what,
I think you're some kind of pervert

24:39.200 --> 24:42.204
and you're afraid I'm muscling in
on your fucking fondle territory.

24:42.280 --> 24:46.205
- That's what I think.
<i>- I</i> see what's going on here. Yes, I see.

24:46.280 --> 24:48.089
- You are hurting inside.
- Is that right?

24:48.160 --> 24:50.208
And there's only one thing
that can change that.

24:50.280 --> 24:52.248
- Yeah? What's that?
- A hug.

24:52.320 --> 24:54.416
- Are you out of your goddamn mind?
- A hug from Santa!

24:54.440 --> 24:56.169
No, I don't need
no fucking hug from Santa.

24:56.240 --> 24:58.641
- Let go of me, motherfucker.
- Melt all that stress away!

24:58.720 --> 25:00.085
Would you cool it, pal?

25:00.160 --> 25:02.176
You're scaring all the kids away.
You know what I mean?

25:02.200 --> 25:04.521
You are a fucking pedophile!

25:06.680 --> 25:08.364
- Let go of me.
- Aw!

25:08.440 --> 25:10.408
Fuck!

25:10.480 --> 25:13.484
- Ooh!
- Fucking asshole!

25:13.560 --> 25:16.211
Fucking shit.

25:16.280 --> 25:18.123
Fucking asshole.

25:18.200 --> 25:21.204
This guy's a pedophiliac, here,
and he's after all your kids.

25:21.280 --> 25:23.056
You better get out of here.

25:23.080 --> 25:27.927
You fucking perverted fucking asshole!

25:29.480 --> 25:31.130
What the fuck?
Hang on a second.

25:31.200 --> 25:34.568
He's the fucking kid diddler, not me.
I'm a hero!

25:39.320 --> 25:43.006
- Sure you won't die up there?
- I've done smaller spaces, trust me.

25:43.080 --> 25:47.847
Well, if you don't make it, son,
I got a cigar box, make a nice casket.

25:47.920 --> 25:49.649
Who you calling "son"?

25:49.720 --> 25:52.600
Well, I'm proud to say that my pussy
is color-blind, so you never know.

25:52.920 --> 25:53.967
Oh!

25:55.640 --> 25:59.850
Whoa! You go, little sperm.
Get up in there.

26:01.520 --> 26:03.887
Well, you don't see
something like that every day.

26:13.800 --> 26:17.486
Ow! Bottles! Recycle that shit!

26:18.480 --> 26:23.088
Oh! What the fuck is tha... Oh, shit! No!

26:31.440 --> 26:32.771
Hey.

26:34.800 --> 26:37.565
I always wanted to fuck me a Santa.

26:37.640 --> 26:40.610
Well, I always wanted to shit
on a tattooed dick

26:40.680 --> 26:42.523
so we're perfect for each other.

26:43.880 --> 26:47.771
- Cook, let's go.
- See you in my dreams, chief.

26:50.280 --> 26:51.691
Thank you.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.162
You're not the first volunteer
to go off the rails.

26:55.240 --> 26:58.005
Lucky for you, Giving City
has a high standing in the community,

26:58.080 --> 26:59.366
so you won't get charged.

27:00.720 --> 27:02.848
You can turn in your suit
when you clean yourself up.

27:02.920 --> 27:05.161
Now, hang on a second. You're firing me?

27:05.240 --> 27:07.527
I rooted out a pervert.

27:07.600 --> 27:09.841
You should be throwing me
a fucking parade.

27:09.920 --> 27:13.003
And we're very grateful.
But you reek of whiskey.

27:13.080 --> 27:15.162
You know the rules
and you're flouting them.

27:15.240 --> 27:16.480
Flouting?

27:16.560 --> 27:20.531
I never sucked jizz out of nobody's ass.
I mean, with a straw.

27:20.600 --> 27:22.841
I believe that's felching.

27:22.920 --> 27:24.729
Not that I would know.

27:24.800 --> 27:30.409
Uh, happy holidays, Mr. Cook.
Consider your freedom a gift from me.

27:31.200 --> 27:36.240
Well, hang on a second. Hang on!
I only had one drink.

27:36.320 --> 27:39.642
And that was just to keep warm out there.
I'm freezing my nuts off.

27:39.760 --> 27:42.809
And if we're being honest here,
you, you guys should be supplying us

27:42.880 --> 27:45.201
with some kind of electric underwear
or some shit.

27:45.280 --> 27:50.605
Oh, well, if we're being honest,
I don't like being lied to.

27:50.680 --> 27:54.844
- Please. I need this.
- Why do you care so much?

27:54.920 --> 27:59.881
Why do I care? Why do I care.

28:01.440 --> 28:05.411
I'll tell you why I care.
Because the world's a fucking shit hole.

28:05.480 --> 28:08.484
But when I put this suit on,
I feel like...

28:08.560 --> 28:13.009
Well, I feel like General MacArthur
must have felt when he put his uniform on

28:13.080 --> 28:14.809
and went and killed all them Filipinos.

28:14.920 --> 28:17.844
Look, I, I put up with
a lot of shit from kids...

28:17.920 --> 28:23.927
For the kids.
I won't piss on the suit. I really won't.

28:24.000 --> 28:27.243
I mean, give a broke-dick
motherfucker a chance, will you?

28:28.640 --> 28:33.282
Fine. I'll give you a second chance.
If you give me a chance to help you.

28:34.880 --> 28:36.291
All right.

29:14.680 --> 29:16.330
How we looking, Alice?

29:16.440 --> 29:17.885
Well, according to this report,

29:17.960 --> 29:20.531
Giving City's gonna lose
a record amount of money this year.

29:20.600 --> 29:23.285
Ugh, every time you say that,
my dick gets so hard.

29:23.360 --> 29:26.045
- Okay.
- Hey, why don't we just do it right now.

29:26.120 --> 29:27.531
- Come on.
- No.

29:27.600 --> 29:29.520
I'll up your commission
to five percent.

29:29.560 --> 29:32.291
Make it ten, and I'll let you do
that thing with my shoe.

29:32.360 --> 29:34.283
Both shoes. And you have to watch.

29:34.360 --> 29:36.681
Deal.

29:39.560 --> 29:42.928
- You can't smoke here, sir.
- So call the fucking law.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.048
And while they're rolling
their fat asses down here,

29:45.120 --> 29:47.930
I'll be smoking like an old Buick,
all right?

29:49.800 --> 29:53.327
Arrested? Christ! William.

29:53.400 --> 29:57.086
- Not arrested. I was detained.
- Yeah. Shot of gin.

29:58.520 --> 30:02.491
What were you thinking?
You could have fucked this whole thing up.

30:02.560 --> 30:04.369
- I handled it.
- Mmm.

30:04.440 --> 30:06.488
Told her I'd go to an AA meeting with her.

30:06.560 --> 30:11.361
Don't buy their shit, William.
No such thing as an alcoholic.

30:12.280 --> 30:13.850
Just a sign of a weak liver.

30:13.920 --> 30:16.651
I said I fucking handled it.
What are you, deaf?

30:16.720 --> 30:20.167
Well, you talk like you have a cock
in your mouth, shitstick.

30:21.720 --> 30:24.041
Hey, you know why we call him "shitstick"?

30:24.760 --> 30:27.650
Because even when he was a baby,
he tried to butt-fuck everything.

30:27.760 --> 30:31.003
- Goddamn it.
- Stuffed monkey, neighbor's dog.

30:31.080 --> 30:34.402
I'm telling you,
if it had a butt, he'd try to fuck it.

30:34.480 --> 30:36.528
He's with his little nub, going.

30:39.560 --> 30:43.246
Anyway, I think you ought to be working
the sexual angle with her,

30:43.360 --> 30:46.682
because I know for a fact
that that husband isn't getting it done.

30:46.760 --> 30:48.728
That guy never rocked a clit in his life.

30:48.800 --> 30:52.327
And that is one piece of motherly advice
I hope you took to heart.

30:52.400 --> 30:56.246
You motorboat that O-button
till she's speaking in tongues.

30:57.160 --> 31:02.200
- You know what "son" means, right?
- When did you turn into such a pussy?

31:05.040 --> 31:08.931
- Don't worry, I'm fine.
- I'm not worried.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.924
I just don't want you hacking up
your lung in my drink, okay?

31:12.000 --> 31:15.846
Not a chance.
Nah, this chassis' built to last.

31:15.920 --> 31:19.288
You know,
I smoked two packs of menthols a day,

31:19.360 --> 31:21.488
washed it down with a liter of this gin...

31:22.320 --> 31:26.166
And I could still fill that shot glass
with this man's jizz.

31:26.880 --> 31:32.011
- I said I don't give a shit, okay?
- Fine. I get it. You're mad at me.

31:32.080 --> 31:34.924
You think I was really ready
to be a mom at 13?

31:35.000 --> 31:37.890
Huh? We were gonna wait
at least another year.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.401
I mean, the one time
your son of a bitch father

31:40.480 --> 31:43.131
didn't put it in my ass,
I had to go and get pregnant.

31:43.200 --> 31:46.602
- Shit happens.
- That's fucking beautiful.

31:46.680 --> 31:49.411
Look, I'm not gonna pretend
I was a perfect mother.

31:49.480 --> 31:50.481
Yeah, no shit.

31:50.560 --> 31:54.201
You made me take the fall for you
when I was 11.

31:54.280 --> 31:56.726
Well, there's no sense in us
both going down.

31:56.800 --> 32:01.601
Besides, it made a man of you.
You are who you are because of me.

32:01.680 --> 32:04.001
No, I'm not anything like you.

32:04.080 --> 32:07.766
Yeah?
Well, you keep telling yourself that.

32:07.840 --> 32:10.605
Now where's your fucking midget?
It's getting late.

32:15.480 --> 32:17.960
♪ <i>Pop that pussy</i>
<i>Hey, pop that pussy, baby</i> ♪

32:18.080 --> 32:20.731
What... What is that?

32:20.800 --> 32:21.801
Shit!

32:21.880 --> 32:24.281
What, do you have
a speaker up there?

32:24.360 --> 32:26.203
Dorfman, get up here.

32:26.280 --> 32:32.049
You sure it was a phone ring?
Might have just been the fan turning over.

32:32.120 --> 32:36.170
Well, Dorfman, last time I checked,
fans don't "Pop That Pussy."

32:36.240 --> 32:38.481
No, I suppose they don't.

32:38.600 --> 32:40.728
No, I think Diane hired someone
to spy on me.

32:40.800 --> 32:43.929
- Diane? That doesn't sound like her.
- I want you to watch her.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.890
Anything unusual, I wanna know about it.
And cover the whole building.

32:46.960 --> 32:49.167
I'm talking microphones,
cameras, everything.

32:49.240 --> 32:52.289
Copy. Ladies' room
is already taken care of.

32:53.880 --> 32:56.008
He's fucking Alice.

32:56.080 --> 32:58.970
- Go figure.
- Why the fuck would you call me?

32:59.080 --> 33:01.162
Well, you're the genius
who left your ringer on.

33:01.240 --> 33:04.642
Because you the only two people I know.
Why would you call?

33:04.720 --> 33:08.042
What's she doing
with that shoe? Oh, God!

33:08.120 --> 33:10.885
He heard a noise in the fucking vent.
What's the big deal?

33:10.960 --> 33:14.931
He heard "Pop That Pussy" in the vent,
and that is a big fucking deal.

33:15.000 --> 33:16.161
Think she knows?

33:16.240 --> 33:19.005
- Who?
- You know, the redheaded gal, Diane.

33:19.080 --> 33:20.616
That her husband's
fooling around with the help?

33:20.640 --> 33:23.883
I'm saying, do you think she knows
that her fucking husband

33:23.960 --> 33:26.122
is ripping off the goddamn charity?

33:26.200 --> 33:28.851
Who gives a shit?
As long as she doesn't get in the way.

33:28.920 --> 33:32.481
- Can you crack the safe?
- Of course I can crack the fucking safe.

33:32.560 --> 33:35.689
Probably take me about three minutes.
Three and a half tops.

33:35.760 --> 33:38.764
Well, you shave a minute off that,
you may be good for something.

33:38.840 --> 33:42.242
- What about the alarm system?
- It's a Centaur 2100.

33:42.320 --> 33:45.767
We power it down,
we have ten minutes before it reboots.

33:45.840 --> 33:48.571
But I'm gonna need a key
to the electrical room to access it.

33:48.640 --> 33:51.610
- It's the only way in.
- Ah, shit, how are we gonna get that?

33:57.840 --> 33:59.376
Don't even
think about it, Willie.

33:59.400 --> 34:02.051
That big bitch is mine.

34:03.680 --> 34:05.921
He should show you some respect.

34:06.000 --> 34:09.129
- You're the talent, not him.
- Hey, Randall!

34:09.199 --> 34:10.610
Mind giving me a hand over here?

34:10.679 --> 34:12.376
I've gotta get this stuff
to the auditorium.

34:12.400 --> 34:16.485
He'd love to, darling.
Strong, strapping man like him.

34:16.560 --> 34:18.927
Clitoris, son. Do it for Mama.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.411
Thanks, Sunny.

34:20.480 --> 34:23.449
She's so sweet. I wish I had
a hundred volunteers like her.

34:23.520 --> 34:26.683
Oh, yeah, she's something.
I'm sure they only made one of her.

34:33.480 --> 34:34.925
How you doing, beautiful?

34:35.000 --> 34:36.922
- Gina, was it?
- That's right.

34:37.000 --> 34:41.880
- Ronald. We haven't officially met.
- Well, hello, Ronald. Officially.

34:41.960 --> 34:45.567
I bet you got no idea
how beautiful you really are.

34:45.639 --> 34:48.210
I don't know.
I think I've got some idea.

34:48.280 --> 34:50.567
- Oh, you do, do you?
- Maybe a little.

34:50.639 --> 34:53.643
I don't mean to be indiscreet,
but I do pretty well.

34:53.719 --> 34:57.042
So if you can't bring your A game,
don't even try.

34:57.120 --> 35:00.169
Sweetheart, I'm not sure
you could handle my A game.

35:00.240 --> 35:02.720
You get one hit of me
and you'll be addicted.

35:02.800 --> 35:07.408
- I like your confidence.
- I'd light you up like the Fourth of July.

35:07.480 --> 35:11.007
Look, Ronald,
I'm just gonna cut to the chase here.

35:11.080 --> 35:13.560
I am strictly first-class.

35:13.640 --> 35:18.931
I'm talking Chrysler 300,
factory-direct, fully loaded.

35:19.000 --> 35:22.004
And after that... lobster.

35:22.080 --> 35:24.606
Now if you think you can handle that,

35:24.680 --> 35:29.242
then maybe, just maybe,
I'll pencil you in.

35:29.320 --> 35:31.288
Bye.

35:31.360 --> 35:36.002
<i>♪ Joy to the world, the Lord is come</i> ♪

35:37.360 --> 35:38.441
Aren't they great?

35:39.480 --> 35:42.370
Regent likes to focus on the business,
but I'm like you.

35:42.440 --> 35:44.727
I am all about those kids
and the Christmas concert.

35:44.800 --> 35:46.484
We all participate.

35:46.560 --> 35:50.531
Volunteers, staff.
If you're interested, you could join us.

35:50.600 --> 35:52.090
You outta your goddamn mind?

35:52.160 --> 35:54.891
I ain't dancing around
with a bunch of candy canes and shit.

35:56.240 --> 35:59.483
Because I'm all about
the birth of Christmas.

35:59.560 --> 36:02.484
You know, the wise guys

36:02.560 --> 36:06.042
kicked him out of the hotel
and the ejaculate conception

36:06.120 --> 36:09.044
and the drummer that didn't have shit
to give him but some perfume...

36:09.120 --> 36:14.047
And the King Midas or one of them
threatened to cut the kid in half,

36:14.120 --> 36:16.805
turn him into gold and but, see, I...

36:16.880 --> 36:20.601
It's a heavy deal for me.
Pretty damn heavy.

36:20.680 --> 36:23.411
Are you talking about
the true meaning of Christmas?

36:24.400 --> 36:27.085
- Exactly.
- Right.

36:27.160 --> 36:29.322
Don't forget about the meeting
tomorrow night at 7:30.

36:29.400 --> 36:33.450
- Oh, yeah.
- Hey, it's only scary the first time.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.002
- Does this bus go to Chicago?
- No.

36:48.080 --> 36:50.686
Son, this bus goes
to the Arrowhead Premium Outlets.

36:51.640 --> 36:54.723
- Is that close to Chicago?
- No.

36:54.800 --> 36:56.928
Okay.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.367
How do I look?

37:02.440 --> 37:05.967
You look like one of those trolls
that gang-fucked Willy Wonka.

37:06.040 --> 37:09.681
Good one, shitstick.

37:09.760 --> 37:13.048
Hey, Shaft, you ready to stick it
to this chick tonight?

37:13.120 --> 37:14.456
Bitch, let me tell you something.

37:14.480 --> 37:18.724
When I was at the pen,
everyone called me tripod.

37:20.120 --> 37:21.929
Well, if your legs are six inches long,

37:22.000 --> 37:24.321
that's not that big
of a fucking deal, see.

37:24.400 --> 37:27.131
Now, if you're six foot five
and they called you tripod,

37:27.200 --> 37:29.726
then you're talking about something.

37:29.800 --> 37:34.362
- Miserable fucks, both of you.
- Mm.

37:34.480 --> 37:38.724
- Goddamn, did you eat your own shit?
- No, I've been eating caramels.

37:38.800 --> 37:42.282
You know how caramels
make Mama belch. Remember?

37:42.360 --> 37:44.488
No. No, I don't.

37:44.560 --> 37:46.767
No, come on. You remember.

37:46.840 --> 37:49.650
Look, when you were a baby,

37:49.720 --> 37:54.169
I used to chew and feed you caramels,
just like a mama bird does.

37:54.240 --> 38:00.088
I'd chew and chew and chew
till they were all milky.

38:00.160 --> 38:01.491
Goddamn.

38:01.560 --> 38:04.769
And then I'd...
spit them right in your little mouth.

38:04.840 --> 38:07.684
And you'd just,
you'd just squint your little...

38:07.760 --> 38:11.162
Can't you see I'm trying to eat
a fucking pizza here?

38:14.520 --> 38:18.047
I swear to God, a fucking electric oven.

38:47.600 --> 38:53.050
Anyway, it took this new set of teeth
to finally see the light.

38:56.040 --> 38:58.964
Jesus, I already need a fucking drink.

38:59.040 --> 39:01.327
People ask me
if I miss my old teeth.

39:01.440 --> 39:06.651
But sometimes, you have to
lose something to gain something.

39:09.680 --> 39:14.402
Now, I'm dating again,
and I'm ready to find The One.

39:14.480 --> 39:16.536
Thank you for that, Jason.

39:16.560 --> 39:20.770
- With no teeth, he ought to try dudes.
- Terrible.

39:20.840 --> 39:22.171
Would anyone else care to share?

39:24.520 --> 39:25.851
Anyone?

39:27.320 --> 39:28.680
The stage is yours.

39:29.800 --> 39:33.805
- Hi, I'm Diane and I'm an alcoholic.
- Hi, Diane.

39:33.880 --> 39:36.201
Maybe next time,
you'll feel comfortable speaking.

39:36.280 --> 39:38.169
I don't know about that.

39:41.960 --> 39:43.530
Okay. Fine.

39:43.600 --> 39:46.080
Maybe you can just talk to me
if that's easier.

39:46.160 --> 39:49.369
Do you ever feel like you hit rock bottom?

39:50.320 --> 39:51.651
You gotta be shitting me.

39:52.920 --> 39:55.685
I sure did. In my late 20's.

39:55.760 --> 39:58.331
You know, some people
can have one drink and they're fine.

39:58.400 --> 40:01.643
I am not that kind of person. I get wild.

40:01.720 --> 40:04.644
- I'm all ears. How wild?
- What?

40:04.720 --> 40:07.451
You mean like sex stuff?
That kind of thing?

40:08.240 --> 40:09.287
Yes.

40:09.360 --> 40:11.966
Alcohol led me to make
some not-so-good choices.

40:12.040 --> 40:14.122
But I've cleaned up my life.

40:14.200 --> 40:16.726
- I met Regent...
- Wait a minute, hang on.

40:16.800 --> 40:20.088
You picked that douche bag up
when you were sober?

40:20.160 --> 40:22.606
He was different
when he was in the Peace Corps.

40:22.680 --> 40:24.125
He helped me find focus.

40:24.200 --> 40:28.762
You don't understand, it was bad.
Three-ways, five-ways...

40:28.840 --> 40:31.969
Five-ways? How many holes do you have?

40:32.040 --> 40:36.125
- Anyway, the drinking had to stop.
- Yeah, I guess so.

40:36.200 --> 40:38.567
It was probably making you forget
all the fun you had.

40:39.760 --> 40:41.967
I'm talking about addiction, Mr. Cook.

40:42.040 --> 40:44.361
Like sex? Or booze?

40:45.720 --> 40:47.529
Listen, I'll tell you what,

40:47.600 --> 40:49.921
I'd like to get you in
that back seat there.

40:50.000 --> 40:53.607
And tear your little panties off
and get that ass in my face

40:53.720 --> 40:57.008
and just fuck that pussy
like you can't imagine.

40:57.760 --> 40:58.966
Excuse me?

40:59.840 --> 41:02.047
You filthy, dirty...

41:02.120 --> 41:04.176
Well, I thought that's what
we were talking about here.

41:04.200 --> 41:05.531
Get out of my car!

41:07.000 --> 41:08.684
- Damn, no sweat.
- Unbelievable.

41:08.760 --> 41:11.570
Goddamn.

41:11.640 --> 41:13.736
- I'm trying to help you.
- Look, I'm sorry.

41:13.760 --> 41:16.331
I fucking read you wrong. I was just...

41:22.120 --> 41:24.521
Well, thank you, Ronald.

41:24.600 --> 41:28.002
- That was some fine crustacean.
- Yeah.

41:28.080 --> 41:30.208
Maybe we should take this upstairs.

41:30.280 --> 41:31.930
- Hmm.
- What?

41:32.000 --> 41:34.970
When it's right, it's right.
I feel it, you feel it?

41:35.040 --> 41:38.169
- You're really fun, but just...
- I'm not tall enough for you?

41:38.240 --> 41:39.844
- What?
- Go on and say it.

41:39.920 --> 41:43.208
No! Your height has nothing to do with it.
I don't even see height.

41:43.280 --> 41:45.521
What's the trouble, then, baby?

41:45.600 --> 41:48.524
You're just not my type.
I'm into older guys.

41:48.600 --> 41:52.321
You know, like, older Jewish guys,
older Irish guys, dads.

41:52.400 --> 41:55.643
Not my dad, other people's dads.
They're the best.

41:55.720 --> 41:58.256
You know, they're usually into anal.
But their wives won't give it up.

41:58.280 --> 42:03.366
But I don't mind. I'm just into, you know,
more mature, experienced guys.

42:03.440 --> 42:06.410
Guys who are well-traveled,
cultured and into butt stuff.

42:06.480 --> 42:10.007
Bad boys, you know. Guys who don't
give a fuck and treat me like shit.

42:10.080 --> 42:14.483
A guy who if I asked him to choke me,
would enjoy it just a little too much.

42:14.560 --> 42:17.291
Damn, girl, I wouldn't pick you out
for that kind of shit.

42:17.360 --> 42:19.886
Christmas in general gets me so drenched.

42:19.960 --> 42:22.281
I mean, a guy breaks into your house,
eats your food

42:22.360 --> 42:24.408
and then punishes you
because you were naughty.

42:24.520 --> 42:26.921
I think I'm gonna go upstairs
and watch <i>It's a Wonderful Life</i>

42:27.000 --> 42:28.889
and rub one out right now.

42:30.560 --> 42:32.449
But thanks for the lobster.

42:35.040 --> 42:37.281
Ain't that but a bitch!

42:37.360 --> 42:39.203
Done ate ten pounds of lobster

42:39.280 --> 42:41.601
and I didn't even get a chance
to smell that pussy.

42:41.680 --> 42:44.570
Damn. Shit.

42:50.080 --> 42:51.764
Fine, get in.

42:51.880 --> 42:54.486
Regent and I haven't had sex
in over a decade.

42:54.560 --> 42:56.085
We stay together for the charity.

42:56.160 --> 43:00.722
I'm a good girl, Mr. Cook,
but sometimes I need to be bad.

43:00.800 --> 43:03.201
Now get your filthy ass in the car.

43:03.280 --> 43:06.090
See, that's what I thought.

43:06.160 --> 43:08.208
Oh, yeah!

43:08.280 --> 43:11.124
Fuck me like the dirty little slut
that I am.

43:11.200 --> 43:13.043
Call me Santa.

43:13.120 --> 43:15.122
- What?
- Call me Santa.

43:15.200 --> 43:18.329
Don't be weird. Tell me how dirty this is.

43:18.400 --> 43:21.290
- Call me Santa.
- Shut up.

43:22.560 --> 43:25.291
And spit on me.

43:25.360 --> 43:26.441
Fuck!

43:29.280 --> 43:33.490
- Tell me how dirty it is.
- Okay.

43:33.560 --> 43:36.609
U h, it's a dumpster in an alley.

43:36.680 --> 43:38.842
It's pretty, pretty fucking dirty,
I guess.

43:38.920 --> 43:42.845
- Tell me it's fucking dirty!
- Okay, it's fucking dirty.

43:43.960 --> 43:45.803
It's dirty.

43:45.880 --> 43:49.407
Yes, it's dirty.

43:49.520 --> 43:56.005
- Oh, oh, fuck me. I'm so dirty.
- Yeah.

43:59.720 --> 44:03.327
It was a one-time thing.
That never happened.

44:04.480 --> 44:05.481
All right.

44:14.480 --> 44:16.244
What the fuck?

44:16.320 --> 44:18.482
I'm not missing <i>The Bachelor</i> finale.

44:18.560 --> 44:22.281
I gotta see who the dingleberry
gives his last rose to,

44:22.360 --> 44:25.011
Goiter Face or Drunk Slut.

44:26.480 --> 44:29.211
Fuck! Oh! Get out of my brain!

44:29.280 --> 44:33.001
- Hey, Homeo, you got the key?
- I'm gonna need a little more time.

anything done here tonight?

44:39.040 --> 44:41.611

- What's up, girl?
- Ooh. You know what's up, playa.

48:23.800 --> 48:27.202
I'm sorry, what?

48:34.320 --> 48:36.527
What the hell are you looking at me
so funny for?

48:37.760 --> 48:40.650
Sorry, Santa. I had to go.

48:42.120 --> 48:45.408
Oh, is that you?
I thought it was me.

48:46.920 --> 48:50.891
Hey, Greta. Could you, uh, get me a rag
and a real drink, please?

48:50.960 --> 48:52.325
Of course. I'll be right back.

48:57.360 --> 49:00.921
Come on. Get out of here.
Put a fucking diaper on.

49:06.040 --> 49:09.567
- Hey, you're wet.
- No shit. What can I do for you?

49:09.640 --> 49:13.326
Will you be able to find me
at my grandma's house in Grand Rapids?

49:13.400 --> 49:18.531
Because no one's going to be
at our Chicago house for two weeks.

49:18.640 --> 49:23.089
Oh, yeah. Don't worry. I'll find you.
But, hey, do Santy a favor, will you?

49:23.160 --> 49:25.367
You know the address
of where you're not gonna be?

49:25.480 --> 49:28.563
Write it down on a piece of paper
and bring it back to Santy, will you?

49:29.560 --> 49:30.720
All right, honey. Good girl.

49:32.080 --> 49:33.127
What do you want?

49:33.240 --> 49:36.289
I want <i>Minecraft, Halo 5 Guardians,</i>
<i>Rise of the Tomb Raider,</i>

49:36.360 --> 49:39.330
<i>Project X Zone Two, Assassin's Creed
Chronicles Trilogy, As...</i>

49:39.400 --> 49:41.846
Yeah, yeah. That's great, that's great.
I, I don't know.

49:41.920 --> 49:43.736
<i>- Call of Duty Black Ops III...</i>
- I don't know what you're talking about.

49:43.760 --> 49:45.125
I have no idea what that shit is.

49:45.200 --> 49:48.204
You could be speaking fucking Swahili
and I wouldn't know any better.

49:48.280 --> 49:51.011
<i>- Grand Theft Auto V.</i>
- Nah, I don't care.

49:56.480 --> 49:57.766
What can I get you?

49:57.840 --> 49:59.763
A stuffed cow that moos
but doesn't poop.

49:59.840 --> 50:03.925
- Some duct tape so I can build a boat.
- What?

50:04.000 --> 50:08.483
A stuffed cow that moos but doesn't poop.
Some duct tape so I can build a boat.

50:08.560 --> 50:10.005
Okay.

50:11.440 --> 50:14.250
Have a seat. What can Santy Claus get you?

50:14.320 --> 50:16.641
A penguin. It doesn't have to be alive.

50:28.320 --> 50:31.130
- What's up, champ?
- I want a hand grenade.

50:31.200 --> 50:32.929
Yeah, well, I want a hand release,

50:33.000 --> 50:35.082
but you don't see me
holding my breath, do you?

50:35.160 --> 50:38.767
- What's a hand release?
- It's kind of a compromise.

50:38.840 --> 50:42.003
Anyway, Santy ain't no arms dealer,
so I can't help you out.

50:42.080 --> 50:44.242
See you later.

50:52.760 --> 50:54.091
Let's go.

51:01.720 --> 51:03.609
Oops!

51:03.680 --> 51:05.762
Walk. Don't run!

51:07.200 --> 51:10.090
That's quite a grip you got there.
What are you, a lumberjack?

51:10.160 --> 51:13.448
- Shot put. Olympic alternate.
- Nice.

51:13.520 --> 51:16.205
Hey, listen, can you kind of stay up
on the business end

51:16.280 --> 51:18.009
and stay away from the nuts?

51:18.080 --> 51:21.402
Maybe if you put your thumb up my ass?

51:21.480 --> 51:24.211
No, I don't do that.

51:24.280 --> 51:27.841
- Kiddums.
- Goddamn it. That's my mom.

51:27.920 --> 51:31.447
- Time to get a move on.
- Ew. Your mom?

51:31.520 --> 51:33.045
Yeah. Help me zip this shit.

51:33.120 --> 51:34.963
What? Ugh.

51:44.400 --> 51:46.721
Davis! Davis!

51:47.760 --> 51:50.650
- Where's your friend at?
- I ain't got any fucking friends!

51:50.720 --> 51:52.051
Hey, watch your language.

51:52.120 --> 51:55.602
Why don't I watch my dick go in and out
of your wife's pussy lips while I'm at it?

51:55.680 --> 52:00.242
Oh, yeah? Well, joke's on you
because my wife died six months ago. Boom!

52:00.320 --> 52:05.167
Like that will fucking stop me?
Rigor mortis just make the pussy tighter.

52:05.240 --> 52:07.322
Oh. Where's Cook?

52:09.680 --> 52:11.967
You see that?

52:12.040 --> 52:15.362
Huh? Yeah.

52:15.440 --> 52:18.683
- We still got it, kid.
- Yeah, I guess so.

52:18.760 --> 52:21.411
It was always supposed
to be this way, William.

52:21.480 --> 52:25.963
You, me. Before I fucked it all up.

52:27.560 --> 52:30.086
But even when I was in the joint,
I thought of you.

52:30.160 --> 52:33.960
And I always had a drink
on your birthday... January third.

52:35.080 --> 52:37.003
Seventh.

52:37.080 --> 52:40.163
- August fourth.
- Fourth?

52:40.240 --> 52:42.447
And August. Yeah.

52:42.520 --> 52:47.651
Well, fuck a duck.
Anyway, uh, the point is that I miss this.

52:47.720 --> 52:53.090
Just think of the damage we could do.
Just the two of us. All the time.

52:53.920 --> 52:56.491
Hey. You know what? I got you a gift.

52:56.560 --> 52:59.643
You never got me a gift
in my entire fucking life.

52:59.720 --> 53:00.801
Well, boohoo.

53:00.880 --> 53:05.010
You think it was raining presents
in my backyard when I was a kid?

53:05.080 --> 53:09.005
Look, I'm trying to make up
for lost time here.

53:09.120 --> 53:12.602
- You know, be a better...
- Parent?

53:14.640 --> 53:18.042
Yeah. I found this in the bedside table.

53:18.120 --> 53:19.176
Think fast.

53:19.200 --> 53:22.090
The fuck?

53:22.160 --> 53:25.369
- Don't do that.
- Oh, that's for me.

53:25.440 --> 53:26.965
Shut up.

53:27.040 --> 53:29.088
- Pew-pew.
- Don't touch me with the fucking thing.

53:30.720 --> 53:35.009
No, seriously. I did get you a gift.

53:35.080 --> 53:38.971
- I want you to have this.
- What the fuck's that for?

53:39.040 --> 53:44.843
The midget. He tried to kill you once.
I'm not gonna give him a second chance.

53:44.920 --> 53:50.211
- I think he knows better by now, okay?
- Hey, hey, hey.

53:50.280 --> 53:54.330
You're my shitstick. And nobody's
gonna mess with you on my watch.

53:59.280 --> 54:00.281
I'm fine.

54:07.040 --> 54:09.361
We gotta get rid of this van and split up.

54:09.440 --> 54:11.204
- Hey, pull over right here.
- What for?

54:11.280 --> 54:13.044
Just fucking pull over, okay?

54:17.440 --> 54:19.647
Okay, just wait right here.
Keep it running.

54:20.880 --> 54:22.325
Be right back.

54:35.440 --> 54:37.204
Wow.

54:37.280 --> 54:38.486
Okay, go, go, go, go, go!

54:38.560 --> 54:40.449
Hey! Hey! Open the door!

54:43.800 --> 54:47.043
- Fuck!
- What you got?

54:47.120 --> 54:49.248
Here, drink this.

54:51.000 --> 54:54.243
- You sweet little muskrat.
- Don't get all choked up.

54:54.320 --> 54:56.004
I'm just tired of that fucking coughing.

54:57.280 --> 54:58.566
Ahhh.

54:58.640 --> 55:02.531
- I hadn't gotten 'tussed up in a while.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

55:02.600 --> 55:05.649
Nothing but an old address
somewhere outside Albany.

55:05.720 --> 55:07.961
- Nothing else? Shit.
- The guy's a ghost.

55:08.040 --> 55:10.008
Okay, call Detective O'Neill
at Precinct 12.

55:10.080 --> 55:13.323
- Have him run a facial rec.
- Fuck yeah. Facial rec.

55:13.400 --> 55:16.847
- That's a level-nine surveillance.
- Yeah.

55:32.440 --> 55:34.488
Yes! Oh! Oh!

55:37.200 --> 55:38.929
- Don't hold back.
- Don't hold back?

55:39.000 --> 55:42.891
What do you want, a fucking jackhammer?
Goddamn, I nearly broke my fucking pelvis.

55:42.960 --> 55:45.361
No, I mean hurry up and cum.
I can hear someone.

55:45.440 --> 55:47.204
Call me "Santa."

55:47.320 --> 55:49.527
Fine.

55:49.600 --> 55:51.284
- Fuck me, Santa.
- Louder.

55:51.360 --> 55:53.283
- Fuck me, Santa!
- There you go.

55:53.360 --> 55:55.567
Fuck me, Santa! Fuck me, Santa!

55:55.640 --> 55:59.611
Fuck me, Santa!
Fuck me, Santa! Fuck me, Santa!

55:59.680 --> 56:01.170
Fuck me, Santa!

56:01.240 --> 56:04.369
Fuck me, Santa!
Fuck me, Santa! Fuck me, Santa!

56:04.440 --> 56:06.400
- No, more.
- Oh, fuck me, Santa!

56:06.440 --> 56:09.091
Fuck me, Santa!
Fuck me, Santa!

56:09.160 --> 56:11.686
Oh.

56:11.760 --> 56:14.081
Merry fucking Christmas.

56:20.360 --> 56:22.328
- All right, then.
- That also...

56:22.440 --> 56:25.683
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know, I know, I know!
Uh, it never happened. I get it.

56:26.960 --> 56:32.046
U m, I ain't exactly what you call
the romantic type, you know.

56:32.120 --> 56:34.771
I don't go in for all the sappy shit.

56:34.840 --> 56:40.529
But, um, I gotta tell you,
you got gigantic titties.

56:40.600 --> 56:45.925
- And that's no shit.
- Um... thanks?

56:46.000 --> 56:49.049
No sweat.

56:49.120 --> 56:51.122
See you.

56:53.720 --> 56:55.722
Fuck.

56:55.800 --> 56:58.485
- This better be an emergency.
- Willie, where are you?

56:58.600 --> 57:00.841
I'm in Chicago,
but I can't find you anywhere.

57:00.920 --> 57:04.003
Wait, hang on a second.
What are you doing in fucking Chicago?

57:04.080 --> 57:06.242
I wanted to surprise you for Christmas.

57:06.360 --> 57:08.567
The best Christmas gifts
are always a surprise.

57:08.640 --> 57:12.770
Are you off of your goddamn nut?
Is that what you do?

57:12.840 --> 57:15.176
<i>You follow people
all the way across the fucking country?</i>

57:15.200 --> 57:16.804
Not everyone. Just you.

57:16.880 --> 57:20.601
- <i>Are you surprised?</i>
- No, this shit happens every day.

57:20.680 --> 57:24.162
- <i>It does?</i>
- No. On what fucking planet...?

57:24.240 --> 57:26.242
<i>Never mind.
What the fuck are you doing?</i>

57:26.320 --> 57:30.803
Uh, Willie, it's really cold here.
I didn't bring a coat. Only my gloves.

57:30.880 --> 57:33.531
<i>Goddamn it.
You gotta be shitting me.</i>

57:33.600 --> 57:36.206
<i>Do you got a pencil
or some shit to write on?</i>

57:51.000 --> 57:54.288
Who is it?

57:59.320 --> 58:02.483
- Who the fuck are you?
- Grandma Willie!

58:05.440 --> 58:07.656
And Willie was in such a hurry
to get me my elephant

58:07.680 --> 58:09.056
that I guess he forgot to pay for it.

58:09.080 --> 58:13.404
And that made the policemen really mad.
So they followed him back to the house.

58:13.480 --> 58:16.006
And Willie ran really fast
and he almost got to the door,

58:16.080 --> 58:19.129
but then they shot him
like eight times in the back.

58:19.200 --> 58:21.851
In the cowboy movies,
they say that's not even fair.

58:21.920 --> 58:25.970
And this is the first present
Willie ever got me for Christmas.

58:26.040 --> 58:27.087
With his blood.

58:29.400 --> 58:33.485
- Willie, you're home!
- Goddamn, kid. Watch the spine bone.

58:33.560 --> 58:36.131
I was just telling your mom
how you're a hero.

58:36.240 --> 58:39.005
Yeah, yeah. Hang on a second.

58:39.080 --> 58:42.289
You didn't bring a fucking coat,
but you brought that elephant?

58:42.360 --> 58:45.569
- You didn't tell me to bring a coat.
<i>- I</i> didn't tell you to come.

58:45.640 --> 58:49.531
- Is this your spawn?
- Do I look like I made him?

58:49.600 --> 58:51.056
Well, if this ain't
fetal alcohol syndrome,

58:51.080 --> 58:52.605
then what the fuck is it?

58:52.680 --> 58:56.321
- He keeps trying to make me a sandwich.
- That's what he does.

58:57.760 --> 58:59.125
Elf!

59:00.880 --> 59:02.291
Hey! You get that key?

59:04.480 --> 59:05.527
You got smaller.

59:09.280 --> 59:13.410
What the... Am I tripping?

59:13.480 --> 59:15.767
You might be, because,
you know, certain pussy

59:15.840 --> 59:18.969
has hallucinogenic aftereffects
if you eat too much of it.

59:19.040 --> 59:22.965
I found out the hard way once
when I messed with my own kind.

59:23.080 --> 59:27.051
One time, I ate too much turkey bacon,
I didn't poop for two weeks.

59:27.120 --> 59:28.963
For four weeks.

59:33.160 --> 59:36.846
- The key, shorty.
- Okay, first of all, fuck you!

59:36.920 --> 59:40.049
See that? I told you.
I knew he didn't have it in him.

59:40.120 --> 59:43.886
And second of all,
what in the fuck is he doing here?

59:43.960 --> 59:46.850
- That is not how you serve a sandwich.
- Willie.

59:46.920 --> 59:48.968
I'm working on it, okay?

59:49.040 --> 59:51.088
Hey, kid, listen.

59:51.160 --> 59:54.369
This is really not the right place
for you to be, okay?

59:54.440 --> 59:58.001
Because there's not enough beds?
I only counted one, plus a couch.

59:58.080 --> 01:00:00.606
- Exactly.
- You should get bunk beds, Willie.

01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:01.976
Yeah, maybe we'll do that.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.526
But, uh, in the meantime,
let's you and me head out, all right?

01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:08.161
Bye, Elf. Bye, Willie's mom.

01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:11.801
My mom's in Jesus' house with Mary
and Joseph and the talking walnut.

01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:16.404
- You 100 percent sure he's not yours?
- Yeah.

01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:19.450
Well, then, cut him loose.
Set some boundaries, for chrissake.

01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:23.081
You can't have every stray
following you around like a lost puppy.

01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:25.891
- Jesus!
- I said I'm going, okay?

01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:30.522
Can we get a Chicago pizza?
It's like pizza, but in Chicago.

01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:33.331
Yeah, we'll get a pizza. No sweat.

01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:42.282
This is really fun, Willie.
I didn't even know you had a mom.

01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:46.490
- What'd you think? I was just hatched?
- Well, where were you born?

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:51.726
I was born in the Pulaski County Juvenile
Detention Center in Little Rock, Arkansas.

01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:55.964
- Oh, that sounds really nice.
- Well, it wasn't nice.

01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:59.806
And she's a mean fucking bitch,
so don't go getting any ideas, all right?

01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:03.282
Well, sometimes you're not nice.
But you're still Santa.

01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:08.082
Listen kid, seriously.
You're all grown-up and shit now, okay?

01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:11.801
- You gotta stop that.
- Well, I know you're not <i>the</i> Santa.

01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:13.564
But you're still my Santa.

01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:23.366
Come on. Let's go.

01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:07.206
Fuck.

01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:50.009
Fuck! Fucking pussy!

01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:02.604
Look at all the Santas!
I really get to stay here?

01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:05.365
Goddamn right.

01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:08.091
So how long is the kid staying here?

01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:10.162
Hell if I know,
I ain't his fucking secretary.

01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:15.883
- You run the joint.
- Cook, you crack me up.

01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:17.166
I what?

01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:22.202
Boarding room's downstairs on the left.
Any bed that's not taken.

01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:28.247
Alrighty, here we go.

01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:30.368
Now listen,
don't be sitting on any toilet seats.

01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:33.523
If you gotta take a shit
just stand over it, couple of feet away,

01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:35.125
take aim and blow it in there.

01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:37.680
'Cause I'm pretty sure crabs can jump.
All right?

01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:40.206
Don't let anybody muscle up on you
in the showers either,

01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:41.566
because they'll try.

01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:44.849
And if a fight breaks out, go straight
for the nuts or gouge an eye out.

01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:51.246
I don't think I like it here, Willie.

01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:53.800
Then you should go home,
like I told you to start with.

01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:56.360
But it's not home if there's nobody there.

01:03:56.440 --> 01:03:58.647
What about Granny?
I'm sure she misses you.

01:03:58.720 --> 01:03:59.960
- She died.
- When?

01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:01.041
Two years ago.

01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:04.169
Same day as the President's Day sale
at Blue Mesa Toyota and Scion

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:06.561
where they put the "whee" in wheels.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.365
Well, Granny had a good run.

01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:12.330
She was about
150 fucking years old, anyway.

01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:15.961
Look at this, this is not so bad.
Look, you got bunk beds.

01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:17.809
Look at that.

01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:21.441
Ow! Goddamn, kid! Fuck!

01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:23.536
- Will we have Christmas together?
- Fuck, I don't know.

01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:26.166
- But, Willie...
- No "but, Willie." Goddamn it!

01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:29.642
I've been chasing your ass off
ever since I fucking met you.

01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:33.526
Do you not take a hint?
I fucking told you that I ain't that guy.

01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:36.530
Life sucks a big, giant dick, kid.

01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:39.120
But you're a fucking man now
and you gotta face up to it.

01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:41.202
Welcome to the shit show.

01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:44.611
- But you're my family.
- No, I'm not your family.

01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:53.241
- Okay. I'll try to be a man. For you.
- No, not for me. For you.

01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:56.936
- Even though I'm all alone.
- You're not all alone.

01:04:56.960 --> 01:05:00.806
Are you shitting me?
I mean, look around here.

01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:03.486
You got all these great guys.

01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:08.885
Except that one jerking off over there.
And that one watching him jerk off.

01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:12.362
You know what, just kind of stay
in this section right here, okay?

01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:16.484
You'll be fine.

01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:30.081
Hey.

01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:34.450
- Where the hell have you been?
- What are you, my fucking mother?

01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:36.488
I've been dealing with the kid, all right?

01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:39.325
Oh, well, don't lose your focus.
We still need that key.

01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:42.609
I tried seducing the girl myself
but she's strictly dickly.

01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:45.445
Concert's tomorrow night.
So you better step up, buddy boy.

01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:47.170
I thought the midget was doing it.

01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:49.766
Marcus couldn't fuck his way out
of a wet paper bag.

01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:52.486
I'll make sure she knows you got
the hots for her.

01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:56.764
- Really?
- That's what he told me.

01:05:56.840 --> 01:05:58.729
Oh, here he comes.

01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:00.768
Of course you may have to make
the first move,

01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:02.729
- because he seems like the shy type.
- Okay.

01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:06.646
Hey. We still good for tomorrow? The plan.

01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:10.691
- Cutting her out after the grab. Right?
- Yeah, yeah. We're good.

01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:15.525
Come on, shitstick.
Bring it on home to Mama.

01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:20.480

I like to sing in the bathtub.

01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:38.009
I'm a soprano. My friend Ronnie says
I sound like Mariah Carey.

01:08:39.439 --> 01:08:44.367
- Hello. What's your name?
- I'm Thurman. Thurman Merman.

01:08:44.439 --> 01:08:47.091
For real? Ha!

01:08:48.439 --> 01:08:50.408
Would you like to join us, Thurman?

01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:54.410
This looks like it might fit.

01:08:56.160 --> 01:08:58.560
- I get to wear this?
- Of course you do.

01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:02.770
You're a Santa now, Thurman.
Go ahead, put it on.

01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:09.085
It's got a lot of paper trash in it,

01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:13.085
so I think it should be a light landing
for both of you. Okay?

01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:14.491
So...

01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:18.645
Where the fuck have you been? We gotta
lock everything down for tomorrow.

01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:22.042
That's my boy!

01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:25.761
- Shit. How'd you get that?
- He tapped that security girl.

01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:30.528
Ha-ha. Very funny.
Wait... for real?

01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:34.207
I didn't exactly have to talk her into it.
She was wetter than Lake Michigan.

01:09:34.279 --> 01:09:36.487
Matter of fact, I think she roofied me.

01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:39.325
Ah, rohypnol.
Excellent icebreaker.

01:09:39.399 --> 01:09:42.085
Of course, it's harder for the girl
because she's gotta get off

01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:44.082
- before the drugs soften the noodle.
- Yeah.

01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:45.884
Ya! You no good motherfucker!

01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:47.176
- What the fuck?
- You...

01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:48.736
- God!
- Get off of him!

01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:50.496
Hey! Get off of him you little shit!

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:52.095
- I'll kill your ass!
- Let go of me!

01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:53.849
- Motherfucker!
- Get off of him!

01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:56.440
Oh, jeez, I'm sorry.

01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:58.648
Hey, goddamn pussy!
You motherfucker!

01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:01.166
Just get off of him. Hey!

01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:04.210
Goddamn it!

01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:06.726
Ow!

01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:10.841
Goddamn!

01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:16.209
My first shot at a good piece of ass
after nearly ten years

01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:19.090
and you gotta go
and take a dump on that too.

01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:20.880
- Fuck you!
- It was just business.

01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:23.491
You just ruined
a perfectly good piece of pussy

01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:25.528
with that diseased-ass dick of yours.

01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:29.685
I'm glad I tea-bagged your drunk ass,
you fucking piece-of-shit motherfucker!

01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:33.128
Would you get it together?
Tomorrow is go time.

01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:36.283
I need some air.

01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:44.405
Now, see? Who the fuck does he think
he is talking to you that way?

01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:48.007
- That's it. We're cutting him out.
- What? Fuck no.

01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:51.163
I mean, he's just steamed a little bit.
He'll be fine.

01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:53.561
Okay, you wanna share
half of your take with him?

01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:56.325
- Be my guest.
- You know, I don't fucking get you.

01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:58.846
I mean, you're the one
that brought that little shit in.

01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:03.608
No, shitstick. I brought you in.
You're the safe cracker.

01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:07.651
He can't even crack his own ass.
Fuck that.

01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:10.451
We're going to Mexico.

01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:13.967
It's loaded now.
You're good to go.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:18.843
You did this whole fucking thing

01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:22.123
just to have me to go
to shit-ass Mexico with you?

01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:26.762
I just thought it might be fun to spend
Christmas with the only family I got left.

01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:31.687
- Why's that such a surprise?
- Well...

01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:37.641
You know, they'd grant Charles Manson
fucking parole if it wasn't for one thing.

01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:41.725
- He's Charles Manson.
<i>- I</i> get it.

01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:47.330
Maybe I don't blame you.
But things change at the end of the road.

01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:50.925
Willie?

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.571
- Willie, you in there?
- Get rid of him.

01:11:56.920 --> 01:11:58.888
- Is this an emergency?
- No.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.576
I just wanted to invite you
to the Christmas concert tomorrow, Willie.

01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:02.681
I'm singing in the choir.

01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:06.242
We're doing all the Christmas carols,
"Silent Night," "Deck the Halls,"

01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:09.529
"Jingle Bells," "Veni, Veni, Emmanuel ."
That one's in Latin.

01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:13.082
I know you're busy, but it's only for
an hour and all the parents are coming.

01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:15.242
And I know you're not my real family,

01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:18.688
but when you don't have real family,
then you have to make a new one.

01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:20.576
And it's actually better
because then you get to pick the people

01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:22.045
who are in your family.

01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:23.485
And you're the family I picked.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.207
And that's why I followed you to Chicago.

01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:29.320
Because I didn't want you
to spend Christmas alone.

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:34.163
So can you come? And then maybe
after we can go to SantaCon or...

01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:37.084
I, I can't. I can't come.

01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:47.529
- Look, I'll try to make it. Okay?
- Okay. I'll look for you, Willie.

01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:49.376
I'll look for you
and I'll wave like this. Okay?

01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:51.289
Yeah. Okay, All right. Good deal.

01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:55.251
- All right. I'll see you.
- Bye, Willie.

01:12:56.960 --> 01:13:01.010
What are you, the fucking FBI?
That place is gonna be crowded.

01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:02.525
He won't even know I'm not there.

01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:04.170
- Good.
- Good night, Elf!

01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:06.200
For a minute there,
I thought you were going soft.

01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:13.726
I hate your guts, motherfucker.
But business is business.

01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:15.086
Let's do this.

01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:22.576
- Hi, thank you so much for coming.
- Okay?

01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:24.736
- You look gorgeous.
- Amazing. H I, good to see you.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:31.083
- Time?
- Concert starts in five.

01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:43.047
As you know,
Christmas is a time for giving.

01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:45.600
And we want to thank you all
for being here tonight.

01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:54.844
All right, let's sync them up, boys.
At 7:45, the power goes down.

01:13:54.920 --> 01:13:56.001
That's on me.

01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:59.084
You got ten minutes to get
to Regent's office, crack that safe,

01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:01.447
grab the money,
throw it down the garbage chute

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:04.649
and then get the hell out of there
before anybody knows what's hit them.

01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:09.965
Now please join me in welcoming
the Giving City Children's Choir.

01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:17.360
And without further ado, I would like
to introduce our choirmaster, Renee.

01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:22.807
You got a match? Well, send it over!

01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:26.965

01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:03.042
The money you helped us raise,
it gave Christmas to these kids.

01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:05.088
You're part of the family now.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:14.047
Hmm.

01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:18.846
Ugh! Boring.

01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:24.089
Ooh, no teeth. That's hot.

01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:31.927
Oh.

01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:39.930
Oh, yeah. Who's got the pussy lips now,
motherfucker?

01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:43.656
- I never gave you this.
- Thank you. Thank you.

01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:44.681
Room 523.

01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:46.536
I'd like to call to the stage now

01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:50.121
a very special member of our choir.

01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:54.171
Please say hello to Thurman Merman.
Thurman?

Gina, check the security cameras.

01:18:11.720 --> 01:18:13.051
Copy, checking.

01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:15.561
Oh, shit!

01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:28.323
- Three minutes, Willie, come on!
- Shut the fuck up! I can't hear.

01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:30.971
Just hurry your ass!

01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:38.881
What the hell is this?

01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:40.456
Wait, bring up my office,
I wanna see the safe.

01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:42.687
I can't, sir.
It still has eight minutes to reboot.

01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:44.125
What? Call the police!

01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:45.730
- Let's go, come on!
- I'm on it.

01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:50.047
Well, that can't be more
than half a million, 600 tops.

01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:51.810
Well, fuck, that's all we got.

01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:54.531
Perfect amount for my cut.

01:18:57.720 --> 01:19:02.886
Are you shitting me? Really?
You know the old lady's right.

01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:07.568
Not so big now, are you?

01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:27.485
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:30.964
Motherfuckers!

01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:36.126
- Lock it down. The whole building!
- We're on a level-ten lockdown.

01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:37.486
Lockdown level ten.

01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:41.369
- Get in!
- You get in!

01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:43.440
Evacuate the concert!
And search everyone.

01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:55.882
Halle-fucking-lujah!

01:19:55.960 --> 01:19:58.042
Oh, baby!

01:20:00.760 --> 01:20:02.205
Oh!

01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:05.323
Sweet Jesus, you made it!

01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:08.244
What's the fucking Santy Claus outfit
all about?

01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:10.004
Now step the fuck back!

01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:13.209
- What are you doing, runt?
- It's called thinning the herd.

01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:16.648
World's gonna be a better place
without the fucking Sokes in it.

01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:19.087
I'm gonna live like a king this time.

01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:22.482
- A fucking sultan!
- Not in this lifetime, Sparky.

01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:26.281
- The bag goes with me.
- You mean with us.

01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:30.046
- No, I mean me.
- What the fuck did you just say?

01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:34.250
When I said this was my last job,
I meant it was my last job with you.

01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:39.641
I knew I should've left, second
I saw your miserable fucking face.

01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:43.010
Why did I forget?

01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:46.527
N ice job on the safe, though.
Yeah, I'm real proud of you.

01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:48.967
Well, you know something, Mama?

01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:51.042
Maybe you're not as smart
as you think you are.

01:20:51.120 --> 01:20:54.602
Did you forget about this?

01:20:54.680 --> 01:20:57.524
Oh, how could I have forgotten?

01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:01.882
Go ahead. Shoot me, shitstick.

01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:19.089
They're blanks, Willie.

01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:23.848
You really think I'd be dumb enough
to put real bullets in that gun?

01:21:23.920 --> 01:21:27.481
Well, I ain't afraid of you, bitch!
I'll blow a hole through your ass so...

01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:32.970
The fuck?

01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:34.976
Drop your weapons!
Put your hands in the...

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:38.368
Hey, hang on a second. She's got
the money, I'm just a fucking guy!

01:22:04.680 --> 01:22:07.160
Willie! Hey, Willie!

01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:20.444
Ticket please.

01:22:37.760 --> 01:22:40.411
Let us through right now.
We're chasing a suspect.

01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:15.890
Come here.

01:23:32.120 --> 01:23:34.202
Come on, man.

01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:55.085
Hey!

01:23:55.160 --> 01:23:59.484
- Found this on the coffee table.
- Well, hoo-fucking-rah, William.

01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:02.245
Well, give me the fucking bag.
I'm taking this back to the kids.

01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:04.527
I'd rather them have it
than your sorry ass.

01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:08.326
- Don't test me, boy.
- You're gonna shoot me too?

01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:19.086
- You fucking shot me!
- I told you I would. You never listen.

01:24:21.680 --> 01:24:25.526
Let go of the bag, William.
Let go of the bag.

01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:29.047
Goddamn it, let go of the fucking bag!

01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:39.007
Money!

01:24:40.120 --> 01:24:42.930
It's raining money!

01:24:47.480 --> 01:24:48.925
She's got a gun!

01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:53.330
Willie!

01:24:57.480 --> 01:24:58.896
Drop the weapon! Get down!

01:24:58.920 --> 01:25:00.922
The fuck is going on? Hey, goddamn it!

01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:04.449
I caught a fucking
midget-murdering fucking armed robber.

01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:06.045
I'm a goddamn hero.

01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:27.090
Don't worry, Willie. I'm okay.
It's just in my butt.

01:25:29.680 --> 01:25:30.681
Willie?

01:25:30.760 --> 01:25:33.604
No!

01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:38.128
Oh, f...

01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:43.404
Stand clear.

01:25:45.320 --> 01:25:50.247
Oh! Fuck me!

01:25:52.320 --> 01:25:55.244
- Merry Christmas.
- Yeah.

01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:04.329

what they call a happy ending.</i>

01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:08.325

01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:11.210
