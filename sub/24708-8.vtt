14:33.471 --> 14:36.173
- he told her he quit school.
- yeah, yeah.

14:36.173 --> 14:38.976
he make up his mind to do
something like that,
how am i supposed to stop him?

14:38.976 --> 14:42.096
i wish you would've called me.
maybe i could've talked
some sense into him.

14:42.096 --> 14:45.182
lieutenant fancy,
you the last person i'd call.

14:45.182 --> 14:48.019
so when did you come back
to new york?

14:48.019 --> 14:50.021
you were so set
on south carolina.
yeah, well,

14:50.021 --> 14:52.440
it didn't work out
down there.

14:52.440 --> 14:54.825
yeah? seems like you're
doing okay here.

14:54.825 --> 14:56.777
mm-hmm.

14:56.777 --> 15:00.248
- this is a nice tv.
- yeah, maceo bought that
  for me. see?

15:00.248 --> 15:03.451
he don't need to go to school.
 he got a good job without it.

15:03.451 --> 15:07.755
- yeah? what's he doing?
- i don't gotta tell you that,
  but i will.

15:07.755 --> 15:11.459
- he's doing construction.
- how about you, sherilee?

15:11.459 --> 15:14.295
- you back on the stuff?
- i don't gotta tell you
  that either.

15:14.295 --> 15:17.848
you're just trying to take
my kid again.
come down here insulting me!

15:17.848 --> 15:21.102
- yeah, you're using.
- and you're in here without
  a warrant or my permission!

15:21.102 --> 15:24.138
you're using,
and that's a big
television set, sherilee.

15:24.138 --> 15:26.223
big microwave. how are you
putting that together?

15:26.724 --> 15:28.225

15:43.407 --> 15:46.327
i hope you're ashamed.
i hope you still
have that in you.

15:46.327 --> 15:48.462
he's raping me!

15:50.915 --> 15:52.717
okay.

16:04.061 --> 16:06.347
man, you two ruining
in my existence.

16:06.347 --> 16:09.517
send me down 15 to life
when i didn't even shoot nobody.

16:10.017 --> 16:11.986
- you killed those two kids.
- the hell i did!

16:11.986 --> 16:13.988
i was present
when it happened.

16:13.988 --> 16:18.025
i wanna hear this story
about how you got out of
the joint, arthur. sit.

16:19.443 --> 16:22.580
guard got killed on my tier.
i was a witness.

16:22.580 --> 16:25.199
- you ratted out
  the guy who did it.
- [ scoffs ]

16:25.700 --> 16:29.120
i had no problem
turning that con in.
and as far as them kids,

16:29.620 --> 16:31.122
y'all both know that was
all rickie's doing.

16:31.122 --> 16:35.092
i was in the wrong place.
wasn't nobody
supposed to get shot.

16:35.092 --> 16:38.462
here you are in the wrong place
again, arthur, huh?

16:38.462 --> 16:40.848
this time with
a gun in your hand,
shooting willie lopez.

16:41.349 --> 16:42.850
that ain't right.
if we find a gun
in your apartment,

16:42.850 --> 16:45.269
that's not gonna turn out
to be the murder weapon, huh?

16:46.687 --> 16:48.439
if it do,
it don't mean nothing.

16:48.939 --> 16:50.441
no? match it to
the bullets in willie?

16:50.441 --> 16:54.145
- don't mean nothing.
- silly us,
  thinking that's evidence.

16:54.145 --> 16:57.398
i had the gun,
but i picked it up
after willie got shot.

16:57.398 --> 17:01.152
- oh, after.
- i'll tell y'all what happened.

17:01.152 --> 17:05.455
the guys come around the corner
in a chevy or something,

17:05.455 --> 17:08.125
and they start shooting
at willie,
who i'm talking to.

17:08.125 --> 17:11.796
and the next thing i know,
i got this gun in my hand,
and i'm running.

17:11.796 --> 17:13.964
what color chevy or something?

17:13.964 --> 17:17.251
yellow, i believe.
i mean, it's hard to remember.

17:17.251 --> 17:21.806
one minute
i'm standing there arguing,
and then it's, like, bullets.

17:21.806 --> 17:24.224
ayayay.
what were you arguing about?

17:24.224 --> 17:27.762
he owed me $600.
i just got out of jail, man.

17:27.762 --> 17:29.847
you know,
i needed that.

17:29.847 --> 17:34.685
so i call him up on his beeper,
and then he say that supposedly
he gonna have the money today.

17:34.685 --> 17:36.937
- so i set up to meet him.
- where's willie getting
  this money from?

17:36.937 --> 17:39.740
behind somebody owing
some other money to him.

17:40.241 --> 17:42.743
he didn't tell you who?
no. so then i meet him,

17:42.743 --> 17:47.498
and then he tell me
they didn't pay him the money
like they're supposed to.

17:47.498 --> 17:51.869
i'm, like, man, this ain't good.
then here come these guys
in this yellow chevy.

17:51.869 --> 17:55.840
- arthur--
- we got eyewitnesses
  saw you do the shooting.

17:55.840 --> 17:58.042
they didn't see me,
because i didn't do it!

18:01.295 --> 18:03.047
we collar you last year.
you're hiding under...

18:03.047 --> 18:05.266
a pile of clothes
in your buddy's closet.

18:05.266 --> 18:07.551
you tell us that you're up there
borrowing a book.

18:07.551 --> 18:10.020
see, that gives you
a low credibility rating.

18:10.521 --> 18:12.473
you understand that,
right, arthur?

18:12.473 --> 18:14.475
well, then,
lock me up for false reasons.

18:14.475 --> 18:16.310
it happened before.

18:18.979 --> 18:21.782
i'll let him know.

18:21.782 --> 18:23.451
- hello, hello.
- hello.

18:23.451 --> 18:25.202
leo cohen.
i remember.

18:25.202 --> 18:28.372
hope anticrime got
some draft choices along with
that other civilian aide.

18:28.372 --> 18:31.208
someone else said that to me.
i really don't follow
the meaning.

18:31.208 --> 18:34.545
that's the last sports reference
which will cross my lips
in your presence, gina.

18:34.545 --> 18:38.048
i understand
you like arthur cartwell
in the lopez homicide.

18:38.048 --> 18:40.468
- he says he didn't do it.
- that's original.

18:40.468 --> 18:43.554
administrative judge says next
perp we don't get down there...

18:43.554 --> 18:45.222
within 24 hours of arrest
walks out the door.

18:45.222 --> 18:48.309
oh, that makes sense.
this even on
a homicide charge?

18:48.309 --> 18:50.811
- we gonna make that
  with cartwell?
- we're thinking we'll keep...

18:50.811 --> 18:53.063
him out of the system
till we get the ballistics back.

18:53.063 --> 18:55.516
you do what you want.
i'm advising you get him
down to central booking.

18:55.516 --> 18:58.519
- okay, so now you're on record.
- thanks for the advice.

19:00.571 --> 19:02.857
prophet's never known
in his own country.

19:04.158 --> 19:07.027
last old testament
reference too.

19:08.829 --> 19:12.333
- take this guy down?
- yeah.

19:18.005 --> 19:20.341
i tell you, abby,
the endorphin release...

19:20.341 --> 19:23.844
subsequent to these workouts
has gotten to be
the high point of my days.

19:23.844 --> 19:26.630
so, if it feels this good,
it's gotta be illegal,
huh, greg?

19:26.630 --> 19:29.717
oh, yeah.
i feel subject to arrest.
[ laughing ]

19:29.717 --> 19:32.102
listen,
on-on another subject, abby,

19:32.102 --> 19:36.891
uh, i was wondering
at some point if, um,
you'd like to have dinner?

19:36.891 --> 19:39.560
i'd like to a lot.
yeah?

19:40.060 --> 19:43.280
we could go out or, uh,
i'd be delighted
to prepare a meal.

19:43.280 --> 19:45.616
uh, the one thing
you should know, greg--

19:45.616 --> 19:47.902
you did say yes, right?
absolutely.

19:47.902 --> 19:53.290
but i wanted to tell you that
if you're thinking in terms
of romantic possibilities,

19:53.290 --> 19:55.459
i, uh-- i should let you know
now that i'm gay.

19:57.828 --> 19:59.580
i see.

19:59.580 --> 20:02.383
i always worry if i say that
too late or too soon.

20:02.383 --> 20:04.668
of course.

20:04.668 --> 20:09.006
if-if you weren't, excuse me
for being presumptuous.

20:09.006 --> 20:11.342
not at all. certainly not.

20:12.226 --> 20:14.228
[ sighs ]

20:14.228 --> 20:16.230
what-what night would
be good for you?

20:17.681 --> 20:20.150
why don't i
let you know, greg?
certainly.

20:20.150 --> 20:22.269
okay.
fine.

20:46.010 --> 20:47.845
i saw your mother.

20:47.845 --> 20:50.264
[ sighs ]

20:51.265 --> 20:53.267
that stuff, it was just
too hard for her.

20:53.267 --> 20:57.521
you need to stop laying it off
on sherilee now, maceo.

20:58.022 --> 21:00.307
it was you on that bus,
you who had that smack.

21:00.307 --> 21:02.810
and it's me in this cell.
i know that.

21:02.810 --> 21:05.312
you want a lesson
on being a man?

21:05.312 --> 21:08.866
skells lay fault somewhere else
for doing what they did...

21:08.866 --> 21:12.369
and not doing what they need
to straighten out.

21:17.374 --> 21:19.243
i was the one who did it.

21:19.243 --> 21:23.380
these guys from the redrum gang
give me 1,500 bucks a trip.

21:23.380 --> 21:28.218
- that's the puerto rican gang?
- i go to miami
  and pick it up for 'em.

21:28.218 --> 21:32.589
are you late
for making this drop?
after 4:00 this afternoon.

21:37.811 --> 21:40.431
you gonna do what you
need to here, maceo?

21:42.933 --> 21:45.903
- say what?
- yeah.

- lieutenant.

22:19.870 --> 22:23.457

for us to help you out
with some skell, huh?

22:23.457 --> 22:26.794
this is a good kid, ray.
uh-huh.

22:26.794 --> 22:30.164
you want me to deal
with someone else?
lieutenant, my recollection--

22:30.164 --> 22:34.885
your squad had problems with me,
felt i wasn't considerate
enough of some informant.

22:34.885 --> 22:38.222
- this is a different matter.
- usually is when you're
  asking for a favor.

22:38.222 --> 22:40.974
your group's working on
the redrum crew, correct?

22:40.974 --> 22:44.011
- and?
- this kid can help with that.
  how is that a favor?

22:46.313 --> 22:48.315
he's willing to make
a controlled delivery.

22:48.315 --> 22:50.984
in exchange for walking
on a kilo of smack.

22:50.984 --> 22:54.438
- has that ever happened?
- well, that's up to
  the u.s. attorney.

22:54.438 --> 22:57.658
no, it's up to you
talking to the u.s. attorney,
saying you want it done.

22:57.658 --> 23:00.411
you get the play on the collars,
the kid gets another chance.

23:04.281 --> 23:06.283
let me talk
to the u.s. attorney.

23:08.535 --> 23:11.004

- how's it going?
- yeah.

23:39.783 --> 23:42.569
we're here concerning that man
who was shot on 3rd street
this morning,

23:42.569 --> 23:44.988
near the corner of bowery.

23:44.988 --> 23:48.075
- how can you help us with that?
- stanley saw it
  from his apartment window.

23:48.075 --> 23:52.079
- can stanley speak?
- why don't you come on in
  and talk to us, mr. angrist?

23:52.079 --> 23:54.548
angrist. yeah.
go ahead, stanley. go ahead.

23:54.548 --> 23:57.334
i'm gonna see patrice donnelly,
and then i'll be back
at the parish house.

- thanks for your help, father.
- yeah.

23:59.720 --> 24:02.089
- sit here.
- can we get you
  something to drink?

24:02.089 --> 24:05.008
some coffee, sir?
no. i'm jewish,

24:05.008 --> 24:07.644
but i know father ferrell
from the neighborhood.

24:07.644 --> 24:09.813
i'm here on his advice.

24:09.813 --> 24:11.982
why don't you tell us
what you saw, mr. angrist?

24:13.317 --> 24:17.154
two black guys
standing in the street
yelling at each other.

24:17.154 --> 24:19.857
nothing new on that.
then a car comes
around the corner,

24:19.857 --> 24:23.944
and another black guy
leans out and shoots one of
the guys who was arguing.

24:23.944 --> 24:26.163
then the car backs up,
and he shoots some more.

24:26.663 --> 24:30.000
then the car starts forward.
the guy who was shooting throws
his gun out of the window.

24:30.000 --> 24:33.420
then the car takes off.
the other guy who was arguing--

24:33.420 --> 24:37.925
the one who wasn't shot--
picks up the gun
and runs off with it.

24:37.925 --> 24:41.178
that's all i saw.
what can you tell us
about the shooter?

24:41.178 --> 24:44.548
i'm on the fourth floor.
all i saw was
the top of his head.

24:44.548 --> 24:47.100
-what kind of look at the car?
- blue-green nova.

24:47.100 --> 24:50.637
that's the end of my statement.
the father agrees this is
some kind of drug thing.

24:50.637 --> 24:54.474
he's okay with me
restricting my cooperation.

24:54.474 --> 24:56.193
this is where i draw my line.

24:56.193 --> 24:59.863
- well, thanks for your help.
- yeah.

25:01.031 --> 25:02.783
yeah.

25:06.236 --> 25:08.572
do you believe this arthur's
telling the truth?

25:08.572 --> 25:11.875
let him stay in jail,
rot for them other murders.

25:11.875 --> 25:13.744
he can still help us
with the shooting, andy.

luckiest african-american going.
exception for that big,
dopey comedian.

25:18.498 --> 25:22.336

- hey.

25:26.590 --> 25:29.726
a little something for you.
thanks very much.

25:29.726 --> 25:32.012
yeah, sure.
you know,

25:32.012 --> 25:33.730
i think detective medavoy
might be sick.

25:33.730 --> 25:36.183
why do you say that?
i don't know.
he looks ill.

25:36.183 --> 25:38.602
- let me see what's what.
- thanks for the soda.

25:38.602 --> 25:40.654
yeah.

25:42.940 --> 25:45.826
how you doing, greg?
i don't know what
to tell you, james.

25:45.826 --> 25:49.112
you feel all right?
yeah, i feel
all right physically.

25:49.112 --> 25:52.366
i've had a surprise that
took the wind from my sails.

25:52.366 --> 25:56.920
what happened?
well, i got the nerve finally...

25:56.920 --> 25:59.957
to ask abby to dinner--
how we discussed.

25:59.957 --> 26:01.708
and?
she tells me she's gay.

26:01.708 --> 26:04.928
that's unbelievable.
can you believe that?

26:04.928 --> 26:08.098
you think she's being straight?
or do i think
this is a runaround...

26:08.098 --> 26:10.384
like the experience
you had with adrienne?

26:10.884 --> 26:13.887
i don't, no. she seemed
very straightforwardly.
this is what's what.

26:13.887 --> 26:16.106
how'd you leave it with her?
the two of you still
gonna have dinner?

26:16.106 --> 26:18.942
yeah. i wasn't gonna withdraw
the invitation, james.

26:18.942 --> 26:22.896
i mean, i didn't even want to.
sure. why not
have dinner with her?

26:22.896 --> 26:24.865
[ sighs ]
yeah.

26:25.365 --> 26:26.867
boy, you could've blown
me over with a feather.

26:26.867 --> 26:30.954
here, want this soda, greg?
it'll give you
a little energy boost.

26:30.954 --> 26:34.458
nah. we've been restricting
our sugar intake.

26:35.959 --> 26:37.711
all right. there.

26:45.836 --> 26:48.388
is there gonna be
any shooting?
there shouldn't be.

26:48.388 --> 26:50.140
they're gonna pick you up
along with everyone else.

26:50.140 --> 26:53.093
so when the officer approaches,
don't resist him.

26:53.093 --> 26:56.480
just do what he tells you to.
they're gonna know it's me
who gave 'em up.

26:56.480 --> 27:00.100
we just have to take this
one step at a time, maceo.

27:00.100 --> 27:03.570

27:03.570 --> 27:07.357
[ man on radio ]
we are in position.

i want a lawyer.
yeah, we'll get
right on that.

28:10.587 --> 28:12.839
i didn't know that stuff
was in there, man.

28:12.839 --> 28:15.592
that kid set me up.
your boys in miami

28:15.592 --> 28:18.095
yo, call my lawyer, man.
the card's in my pocket.
you want me to call a lawyer?

28:18.095 --> 28:20.097
yeah.
i'll call you a doctor.
how's that?

28:20.097 --> 28:22.766

28:40.283 --> 28:43.787

come and get me out.

28:43.787 --> 28:46.006
we found a witness
that backed up your story.

28:46.006 --> 28:51.461
you take somebody else's word,
but i tell you what happened,
and you lock me up.

28:51.461 --> 28:54.181
- who were the guys in that car?
- [ scoffs ] i don't know.

28:54.181 --> 28:57.267
you do. you know who
shot willie, but you don't
want to have to tell us.

28:57.267 --> 29:00.053
i do not know their identity.

29:03.023 --> 29:05.609
know what my partner here
wants to do?

29:05.609 --> 29:09.529
bury the witness statement.
let you do some time
for this hummer beef.

29:09.529 --> 29:11.782
see, that's just how low
you people are.

29:11.782 --> 29:13.950
yeah.
our concern for justice...

29:13.950 --> 29:17.320
gets a little dull with a guy
who sits with
his thumb up his ass...

29:17.320 --> 29:21.374
while his running partner
blows the heads off of
two little kids.

29:21.374 --> 29:23.577
see, this witness,
he don't want to go
on the record, arthur.

29:23.577 --> 29:26.713
so there's nobody else on
this planet besides you, us...

29:26.713 --> 29:28.965
and the guys who did it
that will know that
you're an innocent man.

29:28.965 --> 29:32.636
you would send me down
for something
you know i ain't do?

29:34.588 --> 29:36.890
sleep like babies.

29:36.890 --> 29:39.009
it's up to you, arthur.

29:39.009 --> 29:41.144
see, 'cause either way,
we clear the case.

29:45.982 --> 29:48.318
gerald vought and his cousin
rickie did willie.

29:50.187 --> 29:53.240
willie always
pissing people off,
just like he did me.

29:53.240 --> 29:56.026
don't pay what he owe you,
and then laugh in your face.

29:56.026 --> 29:59.329
he work other people's corners
and think they're gonna take it.

29:59.830 --> 30:01.665
so, that's what happened to him.

30:01.665 --> 30:04.034
- gerald vought
  and his cousin rickie?
- that's right.

30:04.034 --> 30:08.705
- rickie what?
- cousin rickie.

30:18.048 --> 30:21.218
last week, willie's out there
throwing bullets at me.

30:21.218 --> 30:24.187
i don't see y'all
moving on him.
you make a complaint, rickie?

30:24.187 --> 30:26.940
- no. i takes care
  of my own business.
- attaboy, rickie.

30:27.440 --> 30:29.860
it's bright choices like that
put you on the successful path.

30:29.860 --> 30:32.863
- what's open?
- do you feel like
  a big man now, huh?

30:32.863 --> 30:35.732

[ simone ]
what's going on, boss?

30:35.732 --> 30:38.034
i need the pokey room.
mr. arthur fancy.

30:38.034 --> 30:39.819
always acting like
god almighty above.

30:39.819 --> 30:42.155
let me tell you,
i stopped you before.
i'll stop you now.

30:42.155 --> 30:44.658
you see if i don't.
shut your mouth.

30:45.158 --> 30:47.627
everything's open
but the pokey room.

30:52.048 --> 30:54.668
- greg.
- sorry.

30:54.668 --> 30:57.170
excuse me.

31:05.428 --> 31:06.930
he's done muling for you,
sherilee.

31:06.930 --> 31:10.650
he was never muling for me.
i don't even know
what that means.

31:10.650 --> 31:12.686
maceo's got no job
working construction.

31:12.686 --> 31:15.655
he's running smack for
the people you score from.

31:15.655 --> 31:17.991
that's how you got
the big-screen tv
and your big new mi--

31:18.491 --> 31:20.327
he told me he was
working construction.

31:22.779 --> 31:24.664
maceo says you got him the job
making deliveries.

31:24.664 --> 31:27.918
- he said he did it for me?
- which makes you an accomplice.

31:27.918 --> 31:30.587
well, he didn't do
nothing for me.

31:30.587 --> 31:33.924
he did any drug running,
 he did it on his own.

31:33.924 --> 31:39.512
gave me a few presents,
but... i don't know where
the money came from.

31:39.512 --> 31:42.882
you had him running smack
so you could stay high.

31:42.882 --> 31:45.802
now you're willing
to let him go to jail for it.

31:45.802 --> 31:47.554
you can't take his word
over mine.

31:47.554 --> 31:50.357
you go ahead,
take me to court.

31:50.357 --> 31:53.059
i beat you before.
i'll beat you again.

31:53.059 --> 31:55.979
that judge believed me.
[ laughs ]

31:55.979 --> 31:58.481
that's what's got you
all pissed off.

32:00.984 --> 32:03.987
you're just a junkie now,
sherilee.

32:03.987 --> 32:07.540
maybe you started out
something more,
but that's all you are now.

32:10.910 --> 32:14.214
well, you ain't taking my boy!
you don't care
about that boy.

32:14.214 --> 32:18.168
i will send him to prison
before i let you have him.

32:20.503 --> 32:24.090
give me a pen.
yeah, give me a pen.

32:24.090 --> 32:27.894
i wanna write this down.
i don't know nothing about
what that boy was doing.

32:32.265 --> 32:35.185
- can you leave me alone
  for a minute?
- yeah, sure.

32:35.185 --> 32:38.405
uh, i'll be right outside.

32:43.193 --> 32:45.695
maybe prison will
do him some good.

33:06.366 --> 33:08.168
what i'm supposed to do?

33:08.168 --> 33:12.338
you'll be working with
sergeant kahlins as the case
goes through the system,

33:12.338 --> 33:15.458
giving testimony about sherilee
and your other contacts
in the gang.

33:15.959 --> 33:18.678
i have to testify
against my mother?
that's the deal.

33:18.678 --> 33:20.597
it's like the man says.

33:20.597 --> 33:24.634
you'll be
a probationary enrollee
in a boot camp outside albany.

33:24.634 --> 33:28.104
at the end of the trial,
if the judge feels
you've cooperated,

33:28.104 --> 33:31.107
he'll credit your probationary
time against a two-years term.

33:31.107 --> 33:34.778
you'll learn a trade up there,
and your felony's expunged
if you graduate.

33:36.146 --> 33:37.947
then i'll just have
a normal life.

33:41.618 --> 33:44.537
it would be nice
if every kid...

33:44.537 --> 33:47.624
got parents who
looked out for 'em, maceo.

33:47.624 --> 33:51.161
a lot of kids don't.
you didn't.

33:52.162 --> 33:53.997
now we find out
if that breaks you.

she meant staying clean
when she took me back.

34:01.921 --> 34:05.475
-i gotta believe that much.
-there's no harm believing that.

34:05.475 --> 34:08.928
- can i talk to her?
- no.

34:11.848 --> 34:13.850
is cooper gonna want him back
at port authority?

34:13.850 --> 34:17.320
- that's my understanding, yeah.
- okay. i'll run him up there.

34:29.666 --> 34:32.869
so, they in there
talking to those guys, huh?

34:32.869 --> 34:35.621
that fat cop and the other one,
they're in there with the d.a.?

34:35.621 --> 34:39.375
- and your friend rickie.
- he give it up, rickie, by
  shooting willie lopez, right?

34:39.375 --> 34:43.012
you see, my information
led to that.

34:43.012 --> 34:45.014
i'm just a babysitter,
arthur.
uh-huh.

34:45.014 --> 34:48.217

that's worth hard money.

[ door opens ]

34:52.188 --> 34:55.024
what decision y'all come to?

34:55.024 --> 34:58.194
the decision we came to is that
you're off the hook, arthur.

34:58.194 --> 35:00.864
d.a. took a plea. see?

35:00.864 --> 35:04.450
-i got y'all the clearance.

  there's some money...

-[ sipowicz ] yeah?

arthur, you ain't getting dick.

- oh, you were in vice, right?
- uh-huh.

35:37.100 --> 35:39.018
i wish i had
the balls to do that.

35:39.018 --> 35:41.237
yeah? i'd give you
this assignment for a nickel.

35:43.656 --> 35:46.409
bobby and andy cleared
that street homicide, huh?

35:46.409 --> 35:48.912
that first guy they liked's
a scumbag, but it looks
like he wasn't in it.

35:49.412 --> 35:51.447
that arthur?
arthur goes in last year...

35:51.447 --> 35:55.668
for a double child homicide,
rats another con out
for killing a guard.

arthur's back out
on the street.
uh-huh.

35:59.923 --> 36:02.709
how far are you into this guy?
i guess about halfway.

36:02.709 --> 36:06.262
assuming it's me into him.
i'm not sure what you mean.

36:06.262 --> 36:10.099
neither am i.
do you like him?

36:10.099 --> 36:13.553
no. he's a real bad guy.

36:13.553 --> 36:16.556
and i'm in kind of a state
off some personal stuff,

36:16.556 --> 36:20.560
so, um, it's kinda hard
to stay on top of things.

36:20.560 --> 36:23.279
all's i gotta do is remember
i'm a good girl, right?

36:23.279 --> 36:26.616
that's, uh--
that's the rumor
i've been hearing.

36:26.616 --> 36:30.737
- what do you mean?
- everyone says
  what a good cop you are.

36:30.737 --> 36:34.290

yeah, huh?

37:08.440 --> 37:11.660
- this is so good.
- yes. yes.

37:17.666 --> 37:21.336
was it a really big
left turn for you?
finding out i was gay?

37:21.336 --> 37:25.173
i-- i-- i won't deny
 i was somewhat surprised.

37:25.173 --> 37:28.426
well, i really hope that doesn't
stop us from being friends.

37:28.426 --> 37:32.180

abby, i feel like...

37:32.180 --> 37:35.100
y-you could've told me earlier
in on knowing each other.

37:35.100 --> 37:36.968
you know, saved me some
awkwardness in my thinking.

37:38.470 --> 37:40.472
every time you came by...

37:40.472 --> 37:42.223
the machines,
you were like a kid...

37:42.223 --> 37:44.476
who was afraid of the water,
you know?

37:44.476 --> 37:47.312
you were sort of looking to me
for encouragement.

37:47.312 --> 37:49.531
i was worried
that if i told you...

37:49.531 --> 37:52.734
that i was gay,
it might scare you away
from exercising.

37:53.234 --> 37:55.070
oh.
and then i thought
i'd tell you,

37:55.070 --> 37:58.039
and i'd stop using the machines
for a while.

37:58.039 --> 37:59.874

10 years ago.

37:59.874 --> 38:02.827

that would've been silly.

38:02.827 --> 38:06.331

this hurdle,

doesn't surprise me at all--

very characteristic of you.

mean different things...

the time that comes after.

you spent some time with
people who loved you, maceo.

dream set away from
the rest of your life.

so happy to see you again.

be here at 9:00 for the ride.
who are the other people?

41:26.781 --> 41:28.583
i thought you said you didn't
do business with black guys.

41:31.920 --> 41:35.256
you know, mouse,
you stop drinking ginger ale,
maybe i'd confide in you more.

41:35.256 --> 41:40.461
no, jimmy.
in some ways i'd like to,
but i don't wanna start.

41:48.269 --> 41:51.306

i haven't ate all day either.

41:51.306 --> 41:53.691

41:55.193 --> 41:59.113
[ sniffing ]
mmm.

41:59.614 --> 42:02.033
how's work?
you gotta buy a building.

42:02.033 --> 42:05.403
let me fix it up.
a couple months,
that'll be doable.

42:05.403 --> 42:07.038
yeah?
what's in a couple months?

42:07.538 --> 42:10.742
but not if you're with
a boss, you know.
you step out on your own.

42:10.742 --> 42:12.961
i'm game.
 i'm not afraid.

42:12.961 --> 42:15.914
be a little afraid, mouse.
keeps you careful.

42:17.832 --> 42:21.135
mmm. mmm. mmm!

42:21.135 --> 42:27.141
timmy, it's awful.
up yours, jimmy.

42:30.929 --> 42:35.183
two months, mouse.
that's four times 576.
ak-47s.

42:35.183 --> 42:38.686
the first and 15th if those
knuckle-draggers aren't lying.

42:40.154 --> 42:41.990
like i understand
what you just said.

42:41.990 --> 42:44.943
all for the noble cause.

42:44.943 --> 42:48.246
which is what?
what?

42:48.246 --> 42:50.498
what's the noble cause?

42:50.498 --> 42:52.917
i don't know
any noble causes, mouse.

42:52.917 --> 42:56.337
i know a bunch of assholes
in belfast like singing
themselves to sleep.

42:56.838 --> 42:59.173
and maybe i get to buy
you a building, but--

42:59.173 --> 43:02.510
i don't understand what you're
saying half the time, jimmy.

43:02.510 --> 43:06.381
it's not important, is it?
what?

43:06.381 --> 43:08.683
there you go.

43:13.521 --> 43:15.940
-slide that soup back over here.
-sure.

43:21.863 --> 43:24.315
i haven't eaten all day.
yeah, you were saying.

43:24.816 --> 43:26.951
- i feel light-headed.
- you sleeping all right?

43:27.452 --> 43:30.705
oh, pretty much.
i got some situations.

43:30.705 --> 43:34.709
i got a family situation,

43:34.709 --> 43:37.495
another situation.

43:37.495 --> 43:41.249
um, anyway--

43:41.249 --> 43:44.052
those are keeping you up?

43:44.052 --> 43:50.008
um, no, not really.
you know, you just--

43:50.008 --> 43:53.144
you get upset
and so forth and--

43:56.514 --> 43:59.317
you wanna get out
of dodge, mouse?
you feeling light-headed?

43:59.317 --> 44:02.603
mmm. i feel like i said yes
to that scotch.

44:02.603 --> 44:05.857
how do you like that,
the penance without
the pleasure, huh?

44:06.357 --> 44:08.659
oh, yeah.
that's what it feels like.

44:08.659 --> 44:11.029
you wanna get outta here, mouse?

44:12.530 --> 44:15.533
um--

44:15.533 --> 44:18.336
yeah, maybe.
maybe we should go.

44:18.336 --> 44:20.705
sure. you know,
i got my car right out front.

44:20.705 --> 44:23.257
you wanna leave your car
if you're feeling light-headed?

44:25.927 --> 44:27.929
probably should.

44:27.929 --> 44:29.881
what'll i say
if somebody calls?

44:29.881 --> 44:33.601
you tell 'em we'll talk 5:00
tomorrow in person,
or one of those things'll...

44:33.601 --> 44:37.221
get shoved in his belly
or get shoved up his ass,
and we'll see if it works.

44:37.221 --> 44:41.442
- see if his ass works?
- you wanna get clever
  on me, you, huh?

44:41.442 --> 44:44.312

i'm gonna wind
your watch up, pal.

44:52.620 --> 44:56.824

  chivalry's dead, mouse.

44:56.824 --> 44:58.576
