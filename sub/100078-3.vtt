WEBVTT

00:04.004 --> 00:05.881
Oh, no. Maggie, you are burning up.

00:05.965 --> 00:08.175
And now you're on chemo for breast cancer.

00:08.259 --> 00:09.802
I'm going to be careful.

00:09.885 --> 00:11.512
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought I had a patient.

00:11.595 --> 00:14.265
Crockett Marcel, fourth year, surgery.

00:14.348 --> 00:16.726
Welcome back. And the concussion?

00:16.809 --> 00:18.352
Yeah, I'm taking it slowly.

00:18.436 --> 00:21.522
I just have to ask. Do you love him?

00:21.605 --> 00:22.648
My relationship with Phillip

00:22.732 --> 00:25.025
is the only thing in my life
that's working right now.

00:25.109 --> 00:28.904
My lymphoma is progressing
and there's nothing more they can do.

00:28.988 --> 00:31.031
I want to be there. For all of it.

00:33.367 --> 00:34.618
Egg whites...

00:36.162 --> 00:37.413
Whoa.
(CHUCKLING)

00:37.496 --> 00:39.832
What's all this?
It's a meringue.

00:40.666 --> 00:42.918
For breakfast?
No, it's for Robin's birthday.

00:43.002 --> 00:44.545
It's for a Baked Alaska.

00:44.628 --> 00:45.796
The meringue goes over

00:45.880 --> 00:46.922
the ice cream and the cake.

00:47.673 --> 00:48.716
But Robin's birthday

00:48.799 --> 00:49.884
isn't for a couple of weeks though, right?

00:49.967 --> 00:51.635
Yeah. This is a test run.

00:51.719 --> 00:53.304
Oh.
(CHUCKLING)

00:53.387 --> 00:55.139
What's the fire extinguisher for?

00:55.931 --> 00:57.141
I'm gonna set it on fire.

00:58.225 --> 00:59.769
Hey, how do you keep
the ice cream from melting?

00:59.852 --> 01:01.312
That's what the test run's for.

01:01.395 --> 01:03.147
Ah.
Wait a minute.

01:03.230 --> 01:04.565
Maybe I should play hooky today.

01:05.274 --> 01:07.067
Stay home. Be your official taster.

01:10.404 --> 01:11.655
(CRASHING)
CAROLINE: Ow!

01:13.407 --> 01:14.742
CeCe?
Ow! Oh, my gosh.

01:14.825 --> 01:16.285
Whoa.
Honey.

01:16.368 --> 01:17.703
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What happened?

01:18.537 --> 01:20.206
I'm getting so clumsy, honey.

01:20.289 --> 01:22.082
Let me look. Let me...
No, no. Please, please. Please.

01:22.166 --> 01:25.294
All right. Learned this one in biophysics.

01:25.377 --> 01:26.378
Yeah.

01:27.463 --> 01:29.840
(BLOWING)

01:29.924 --> 01:32.176
Stop it.
That's actually pretty cool.

01:32.259 --> 01:33.886
It's all in the lips, ladies.

01:33.969 --> 01:36.055
I bet.
Hey.

01:36.722 --> 01:38.265
Looks like we're paired together today.

01:39.767 --> 01:40.768
Lucky me.

01:41.769 --> 01:42.770
Excuse me.

01:45.648 --> 01:49.819
So, babe. That Crockett guy
is working days now?

01:49.902 --> 01:51.111
What's the deal with him?

01:51.195 --> 01:52.613
Not sure he's my speed.

01:52.696 --> 01:54.907
Strikes me as someone
who doesn't take things seriously.

01:54.990 --> 01:55.991
Yeah.

01:57.743 --> 01:59.787
Doctor Choi.
Yeah?

01:59.870 --> 02:00.871
Treatment Four.

02:01.622 --> 02:02.623
Mags?
Uhâ€“huh.

02:02.706 --> 02:04.708
Todd Shepard?
Doesn't say what he's in here for.

02:05.209 --> 02:06.710
Said he wanted to
discuss it with a doctor.

02:09.839 --> 02:12.591
No, I'm in the ED now.
Treatment Room Four.

02:13.592 --> 02:14.593
How far away are you guys?

02:16.262 --> 02:17.763
You're positive you'll be here
within the hour?

02:19.056 --> 02:20.307
Right. Thanks.

02:21.600 --> 02:22.893
Sorry, I really needed to make that call.

02:22.977 --> 02:24.144
That's okay, Todd.

02:24.228 --> 02:25.813
I go by Shep, if you don't mind.

02:25.896 --> 02:27.815
Okay, Shep. I'm Dr. Choi.

02:27.898 --> 02:28.983
What brings you in today?

02:29.900 --> 02:32.444
About six weeks ago,
I was diagnosed with GBM.

02:32.528 --> 02:33.529
It's a terminal...

02:33.612 --> 02:35.155
Terminal brain cancer.

02:35.239 --> 02:36.240
I'm sorry, Shep.

02:36.323 --> 02:39.243
I've got all my medical records right here
in case you're interested.

02:39.326 --> 02:41.328
Are you experiencing any complications?

02:41.412 --> 02:44.248
Not exactly. Excuse me, one second.

02:48.002 --> 02:49.545
(SIGHS)

02:49.628 --> 02:53.507
The phone call I just made
was to a company called CCI.

02:53.591 --> 02:54.925
Camden Cryonics Institute.

02:55.801 --> 02:58.429
They're gonna preserve me until
a cure can be found for my condition.

02:58.512 --> 02:59.513
They're on the way here now.

02:59.597 --> 03:00.681
To freeze you?

03:01.640 --> 03:05.060
Um, it's called vitrification. But, yeah.

03:05.144 --> 03:07.813
You understand you have to be
declared dead first.

03:08.439 --> 03:09.440
That's why I'm here.

03:10.316 --> 03:12.359
For you to declare me dead, so to speak.

03:13.986 --> 03:16.614
I'm sorry, Shep, I'm confused.

03:19.658 --> 03:23.037
The cocktail I've been drinking
contains amitriptyline,

03:23.120 --> 03:26.999
lorazepam and two hundred milligrams
of amphetamines.

03:27.082 --> 03:28.959
It should put me to sleep
in a little over an hour

03:29.043 --> 03:32.129
and arrest my heart sufficiently
for you to declare me dead in about five.

03:33.672 --> 03:35.841
I have a D.N.I. and D.N.R.
My lawyer assures me it's all in order.

03:35.925 --> 03:37.384
Doris! Come here,
we gotta pump his stomach.

03:37.468 --> 03:39.053
Stop! I refuse treatment!

03:39.136 --> 03:40.137
Don't listen to him, Doris.
SHEP: Help! Assault!

03:40.220 --> 03:41.972
Give me the tube.
This doctor keeps touching me,

03:42.056 --> 03:45.935
I'll sue the whole lot of you!
Dr. Choi. Stop.

03:56.820 --> 03:58.989
Well, here you can see the fracture
of the distal radius.

03:59.073 --> 04:00.115
Minimal displacement.

04:00.783 --> 04:03.744
CeCe, are you all right?
Maggie said you took some kind of fall...

04:03.827 --> 04:05.371
Broke her wrist.

04:05.454 --> 04:06.705
My arms aren't as long as they used to be.

04:06.789 --> 04:09.500
I've seen worse. Four to six weeks
in a cast, you'll be fine.

04:09.583 --> 04:11.919
What? Four to six weeks?
Well, wait a minute.

04:12.670 --> 04:14.672
I need to be able to use my arm.

04:14.755 --> 04:16.674
Isn't there another operation we can do?

04:17.549 --> 04:19.551
Normally, yeah,
we would surgically insert a plate.

04:19.635 --> 04:20.970
Shorten your recovery time,

04:21.053 --> 04:22.638
but I really wouldn't
recommend that, Mrs. Charles.

04:22.721 --> 04:23.722
Why?

04:23.806 --> 04:26.266
You'd just open the door to a whole host
of other complications

04:26.350 --> 04:28.352
given your condition, babe.
It's just not worth it.

04:28.435 --> 04:29.937
They're right, CeCe.

04:30.020 --> 04:32.147
Let's just let ortho put a cast on it.

04:32.231 --> 04:33.649
It's the least worst option.

04:33.732 --> 04:34.775
Right?

04:34.858 --> 04:36.318
Hey, I'll go talk to the attending.

04:36.402 --> 04:37.861
Thank... Wait a minute.

04:37.945 --> 04:39.655
You okay, CeCe?

04:39.738 --> 04:41.323
She wants to make
a Baked Alaska for Robin.

04:41.407 --> 04:44.284
It was a flambe. I was making her
a flambe for her birthday.

04:44.368 --> 04:47.329
Okay. I'll go to the bakery.
I'll get a big old cake...

04:47.413 --> 04:50.082
No way.
Sparklers. And we'll do it up nice.

04:50.165 --> 04:51.166
All right?

04:51.250 --> 04:54.545
Daniel, I hate to pull you away
but we've got a situation.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.046
It's fine. You can go. Go.
Okay?

04:56.130 --> 04:57.464
It's fine. I'm fine.
I'll be right back.

04:57.548 --> 04:59.258
I'm fine. I'm fine.
All right, ya all right?

05:02.052 --> 05:04.555
He's committing suicide right in front
of us, how's this a grey area?

05:04.638 --> 05:07.808
Well, it's complicated,
due to his condition and his prognosis.

05:07.891 --> 05:11.228
Have you had a chance to review
Mr. Shepard's medical records, Sam?

05:11.311 --> 05:13.397
Yeah, he's terminal.

05:13.480 --> 05:16.734
I mean, I could go in and do a resection
and aggressively radiate but it...

05:16.817 --> 05:18.694
It'd buy him 12 to 15 months, tops.

05:18.777 --> 05:20.904
It's a question of "when"
and not "if" with this guy.

05:20.988 --> 05:22.865
And Mr. Shepard has the right
to refuse treatment.

05:22.948 --> 05:24.575
He's just a kid.
Not according to the law.

05:24.658 --> 05:27.828
He's 18. He's talking about
freezing his brain, for Christ's sakes.

05:27.911 --> 05:29.621
He thinks he's living
in some kind of comic book.

05:29.705 --> 05:32.207
Well, where are we with cryonics, Sam?

05:32.291 --> 05:34.752
I mean, is it possible
to freeze the brain?

05:34.835 --> 05:37.463
Yeah, sort of, but that's the easy part.

05:37.546 --> 05:39.715
Hard part's thawing it out again
and having it still work.

05:39.798 --> 05:41.759
And that ain't even close to happening.

05:41.842 --> 05:44.011
Miss Goodwin, I need to lavage
this kid's stomach right now

05:44.094 --> 05:45.637
or else the drugs'll
get into his bloodstream

05:45.721 --> 05:46.805
and we'll be forced
to use supportive measures.

05:46.889 --> 05:49.725
No, no. Mr. Shepard has a D.N.I.
and a D.N.R., Dr. Choi.

05:49.808 --> 05:51.852
So, unless the hospital
deems him incapable of

05:51.935 --> 05:54.229
making an informed decision,
we have to honor his wishes.

05:55.189 --> 05:59.026
All right, so let's ascertain
Mr. Shepard's decisional capacity

05:59.109 --> 06:00.486
and then go from there.

06:00.569 --> 06:03.072
Uh, Daniel? Daniel?

06:03.155 --> 06:04.615
Yeah.
Mr. Shepard?

06:04.698 --> 06:06.492
Yes. I will talk to him.

06:06.575 --> 06:08.577
How long before he starts
to lose consciousness?

06:08.660 --> 06:09.912
Forty, 45 minutes.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.126
MAGGIE: Sharon, a word please.

06:18.337 --> 06:20.172
Why is there someone
named Paula over there

06:20.255 --> 06:21.673
saying that she's here to shadow me?

06:21.757 --> 06:22.758
Oh!

06:22.841 --> 06:23.842
Maggie, I'm sorry.

06:23.926 --> 06:26.512
I intended to speak with you
about that first.

06:26.595 --> 06:30.099
For the next few weeks,
Paula is going to be your new orientee.

06:30.182 --> 06:32.810
Considering how much
you have on your plate.

06:32.893 --> 06:35.437
Sharon, really, I feel great.

06:35.521 --> 06:37.940
Don't you feel worn down from your chemo?
No!

06:38.023 --> 06:40.984
And you're happy
with your oncologist at East Mercy?

06:41.068 --> 06:43.070
They're treating me fine, Sharon.

06:43.153 --> 06:45.155
And no one here knows anything.
But if I've got someone

06:45.239 --> 06:48.200
shadowing me around, people here
are gonna start asking questions.

06:48.283 --> 06:50.619
It's too late. Paula's yours.

06:50.702 --> 06:52.162
But I just...
Humor me.

07:00.254 --> 07:02.256
Hello, Keisha. Hi.
Hi.

07:02.339 --> 07:04.341
I'm Dr. Manning. I hear you hurt your leg?

07:04.424 --> 07:08.095
She tripped and fell carrying a cup
of hot water for me out of the microwave.

07:08.178 --> 07:09.680
Spilled all over her leg.

07:09.763 --> 07:12.850
I'm sorry to hear that.
How about I take a look, all right?

07:14.351 --> 07:15.477
All right, let's see.

07:16.228 --> 07:18.480
(KEISHA WHIMPERING)

07:19.648 --> 07:21.817
Two to three percent
superficial partial thickness

07:21.900 --> 07:23.193
on the left anterior thigh.

07:23.277 --> 07:24.653
MONIQUE: Mmmâ€“hmm.

07:25.237 --> 07:26.613
She has a second degree burn.

07:26.697 --> 07:27.906
Oh, my God.

07:27.990 --> 07:30.492
But it should be able to heal on its own
without surgery,

07:30.576 --> 07:32.286
but it will take a few weeks.

07:32.369 --> 07:34.454
I'm gonna do a quick scrub bedside
just to speed up the process.

07:35.122 --> 07:36.456
Will you start her on an IV?

07:36.540 --> 07:38.000
MRS. JONES: Is it gonna hurt her?
No.

07:38.083 --> 07:40.794
I will give Keisha sedation.
She won't feel a thing.

07:40.878 --> 07:43.422
Thank you for being so still, Keisha.

07:43.505 --> 07:45.382
You are a very brave girl.

07:46.925 --> 07:48.218
All right, I'll be back shortly.

07:48.927 --> 07:49.928
Hey, good job.

07:53.098 --> 07:54.933
Hey, guys.
PHILLIP: Hi.

07:55.017 --> 07:57.477
What are you doing here?
I thought you were headed to the park?

07:57.561 --> 08:00.898
Well, we were, but we were
putting some snacks together,

08:00.981 --> 08:03.775
and we figured you might get hungry,
so, we thought we'd stop by.

08:03.859 --> 08:04.860
Whatcha got?

08:04.943 --> 08:05.944
It's a cookie.

08:06.028 --> 08:08.030
(GASPS) It's a cookie!
It's a cookie!

08:08.113 --> 08:09.907
(LAUGHING)
Aw!

08:09.990 --> 08:12.492
Thank you. I'm gonna eat it
with my lunch, okay?

08:12.576 --> 08:13.785
Okay.
Okay.

08:13.869 --> 08:15.787
Well, why don't we let Mommy
get back to work?

08:15.871 --> 08:16.872
I'll see you.
Bye.

08:18.540 --> 08:21.001
All right. Let's head on out.

08:22.294 --> 08:24.004
(GASPS) Oh, hey.

08:24.838 --> 08:25.839
Don't work too hard.

08:26.715 --> 08:28.967
You see this door?
We're gonna walk through this door here...

08:30.052 --> 08:32.387
WILL: Owen's getting so big.

08:32.471 --> 08:33.472
Yeah.

08:35.057 --> 08:37.017
Yeah, so, listen,
I've been doing some research

08:37.100 --> 08:39.186
on postâ€“traumatic injury rehabilitation

08:39.269 --> 08:42.356
and there's this computerized
training program funded by the Pentagon

08:42.439 --> 08:44.399
that's had some early success.

08:44.483 --> 08:45.859
Now, it's not on the market yet,

08:45.943 --> 08:48.487
but Abrams says there's
a beta version upstairs you can try out.

08:49.821 --> 08:51.531
It might help you get your memory back.

08:51.615 --> 08:53.909
Keisha's ready to be debrided.

08:53.992 --> 08:55.953
Thanks. Will you hook her up
to the monitors

08:56.036 --> 08:57.287
and prep her for five milligrams

08:57.371 --> 08:58.664
of etomidate.
Mmmâ€“hmm.

08:58.747 --> 09:01.124
And I can forward you
the details on that program if you like.

09:02.084 --> 09:03.085
Sure.

09:05.921 --> 09:09.466
This outfit that you've contracted
with, uh, CCI?

09:09.549 --> 09:10.717
Uhâ€“huh.

09:10.801 --> 09:14.638
They're gonna store you indefinitely
with the hope that in the future,

09:14.721 --> 09:15.931
there'll be a cure for the cancer

09:16.014 --> 09:17.099
that you have?
Yeah.

09:18.475 --> 09:19.476
Well, it sounds expensive.

09:20.686 --> 09:22.396
I inherited some money when Gramps died.

09:23.438 --> 09:24.439
Enough to cover it.

09:24.523 --> 09:27.234
Mmmâ€“hmm. It is pretty farâ€“out stuff, Shep.

09:27.317 --> 09:30.445
You discussed any of this
with your family?

09:34.616 --> 09:35.826
I tried.

09:35.909 --> 09:37.244
Yeah.

09:37.327 --> 09:40.372
They don't... They don't get it?
They don't understand?

09:43.458 --> 09:44.459
Look.

09:45.294 --> 09:47.212
You're here to determine
whether I'm sane enough

09:47.296 --> 09:49.881
to make a decision like this, aren't you?

09:49.965 --> 09:51.300
Yeah.

09:51.383 --> 09:52.384
Here's a hypothetical.

09:53.218 --> 09:55.012
If the hospital across
the street could cure me,

09:55.971 --> 09:58.223
wouldn't you feel ethically compelled
to send me there for treatment?

09:59.308 --> 10:00.517
I would.

10:00.600 --> 10:01.601
Well, that's what I'm doing.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.730
Sending myself to a better hospital.

10:04.813 --> 10:07.149
Only the hospital I'm going to
is in the future.

10:08.358 --> 10:10.235
Have you really thought about
what that future looks like?

10:11.236 --> 10:15.490
I mean, it won't be recognizable.
You won't recognize yourself.

10:17.117 --> 10:20.871
You're trading away, potentially,
a year of your life.

10:20.954 --> 10:24.124
I mean, that's something priceless,
for a huge unknown.

10:24.207 --> 10:25.500
I mean, you understand that, right?

10:27.711 --> 10:30.172
Shep? Shep?

10:30.255 --> 10:31.923
Look, if we're gonna keep you alive,

10:32.007 --> 10:34.676
if you're having any second thoughts,
we need to know that now.

10:36.928 --> 10:38.430
You know the Apollo astronauts?

10:40.599 --> 10:42.309
Those rockets were
just as likely to blow up

10:42.392 --> 10:44.478
as they were to propel them into space.

10:46.355 --> 10:48.190
And the calculations made
to bring them home?

10:50.317 --> 10:51.985
They were done with pencil and paper.

10:54.279 --> 10:56.865
Those astronauts had wives

10:56.948 --> 11:00.118
and kids and lives to live.

11:03.163 --> 11:05.415
You'd have had to been crazy to climb into
one of those capsules,

11:07.667 --> 11:08.668
don't you think?

11:17.969 --> 11:18.970
So?

11:20.055 --> 11:22.557
Finding somebody doesn't have the capacity

11:22.641 --> 11:24.393
to make an informed decision,
I mean, it's...

11:24.476 --> 11:26.103
It's a high hurdle, Ethan.
He's committing suicide.

11:26.186 --> 11:28.772
He's a danger to himself by definition.
Just put him on a psych hold.

11:28.855 --> 11:31.858
Yeah, but if you follow his logic, he's...
He's not committing suicide.

11:31.942 --> 11:34.152
He's, like, doing precisely the opposite.

11:34.236 --> 11:36.863
He's kinda remarkably clearâ€“headed about
the whole thing.

11:36.947 --> 11:40.158
Then what about the medications
he's taking for the GBM?

11:40.242 --> 11:42.577
The steroids, the antiâ€“convulsives.

11:42.661 --> 11:44.621
Those have been known to alter
someone's personality, right?

11:44.704 --> 11:47.416
Yeah, but I mean, we...
We don't have a baseline to compare it to.

11:47.499 --> 11:50.836
A determination like that at this point
would be entirely subjective.

11:50.919 --> 11:53.088
His parents are on their way, Dr. Charles.

11:55.674 --> 11:57.634
Maybe they'll get here in time
to say goodbye to their son.

12:00.762 --> 12:05.142
Hey, Dan. Hey, it's Caroline.
She's insistent on having surgery.

12:05.225 --> 12:07.853
I couldn't talk her out of it.
She's up in ortho.

12:10.730 --> 12:11.857
Help!

12:14.067 --> 12:15.360
My baby stopped breathing!

12:17.529 --> 12:18.530
Oh...

12:19.406 --> 12:20.949
Get help, we got a newborn!

12:21.575 --> 12:23.577
Baghdad! Let's go!

12:23.660 --> 12:24.786
On the move, excuse me!

12:26.163 --> 12:29.666
NURSE: Okay, step in, close the glass.
Cyanotic and unresponsive.

12:29.749 --> 12:31.960
Let's get her on the monitors
and start bagging.

12:32.043 --> 12:35.547
NURSE: Right away, Doctor.
Deep lac on the left anterior chest.

12:35.630 --> 12:37.632
Are you the mom?
Yes. Yes, I am.

12:37.716 --> 12:40.427
What's your name?
Nicole. Is she gonna be okay?

12:40.510 --> 12:42.012
Can you tell me what happened, Nicole?

12:42.095 --> 12:45.140
I was driving to pick up
some groceries, you know,

12:45.223 --> 12:47.058
and all of a sudden,
the contractions started,

12:47.142 --> 12:49.060
like out of nowhere.
Wait a second, you were just in labor?

12:49.144 --> 12:51.396
You delivered the baby yourself?
In the back seat of my car.

12:51.480 --> 12:54.566
That was an accident...
I was cutting the umbilical cord.

12:54.649 --> 12:57.235
NURSE: Can you get a line in?
I was supposed to do that, wasn't I?

12:57.319 --> 12:58.403
That's right.

12:58.487 --> 13:00.655
Heart rate's coming back up.
Yeah, she's still not breathing.

13:00.739 --> 13:03.867
I need to intubate.
Somebody get me a neonatal pack.

13:03.950 --> 13:06.411
I can't believe you're even standing.
Come on, let's get you looked at.

13:06.495 --> 13:09.748
I'm not leaving him!
Nicole, it's a girl.

13:12.042 --> 13:14.002
Come on. You've lost a lot of blood.
No!

13:14.085 --> 13:15.253
Let her stay, Sexton.

13:16.254 --> 13:17.255
Tube.

13:18.924 --> 13:21.968
I'm in. Bag and call neonatology.
You got it.

13:23.386 --> 13:24.888
Can someone get a chair for Mom here?

13:29.809 --> 13:31.728
I'm afraid, Mommy!
It's okay, baby.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.897
The doctor said it wasn't going to hurt.
That's right, Keisha.

13:34.648 --> 13:36.650
Now, you may feel a little drowsy
from the medication.

13:36.733 --> 13:37.776
It's okay to close your eyes
and go to sleep.

13:38.652 --> 13:39.653
Monique?

13:40.779 --> 13:43.073
She's a little hypotensive.
Is it okay to proceed?

13:43.156 --> 13:45.200
BP?
Ninetyâ€“six over sixty.

13:46.076 --> 13:47.077
That's not too low.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.995
She's probably just dehydrated.
Push the meds.

13:49.079 --> 13:51.248
She's been complaining
about feeling lethargic

13:51.331 --> 13:52.666
for a couple of weeks now.

13:52.749 --> 13:54.876
Her pediatrician
couldn't find anything wrong.

13:55.919 --> 13:58.129
I've been getting on her lately,
for being so lazy.

13:58.797 --> 14:00.298
(ALARM BLARING)
(LABORED BREATHING)

14:00.382 --> 14:01.716
What's going on?

14:01.800 --> 14:03.051
She's seizing.
Mmmâ€“hmm.

14:03.134 --> 14:04.302
Push one of Ativan!

14:05.178 --> 14:06.763
BP's crashing. Sixty over forty.

14:06.846 --> 14:09.307
Bolus 500 milliliters of normal saline.

14:09.391 --> 14:11.476
Keisha? Talk to me!
NURSE: Ma'am?

14:11.560 --> 14:13.144
I'm gonna need you to move over here.

14:13.228 --> 14:14.688
I need to intubate. Draw up 50 of sux.

14:14.771 --> 14:16.273
What's happening with my little girl?

14:23.488 --> 14:24.656
Your phone connects to the CarePoint

14:24.739 --> 14:26.116
you're using, right?
Uhâ€“huh.

14:26.199 --> 14:27.617
I'm superâ€“familiar with it.

14:27.701 --> 14:29.828
FYI, got my MICN certification last year.

14:29.911 --> 14:33.248
So whenever you're ready for me to do
an incoming call, I can...

14:33.331 --> 14:34.416
You know what would be really helpful?

14:35.584 --> 14:37.586
You checking
all the drug expiration dates.

14:39.087 --> 14:40.422
The drug expirations?

14:40.505 --> 14:43.633
Yeah, there are dates stamped
on every package.

14:43.717 --> 14:45.677
You can start with the Pyxis over there,
and then of course,

14:46.636 --> 14:47.721
all the crash carts.

14:48.388 --> 14:51.766
Okeyâ€“dokey.
Yeah. Okeyâ€“dokey.

14:54.394 --> 14:55.979
The girl's sedated on a vent?
Mmmâ€“hmm.

14:57.355 --> 14:59.190
Any idea what caused her to crash?

14:59.274 --> 15:01.443
Apparently, Keisha fell
when she burned herself.

15:01.526 --> 15:03.862
Maybe she bumped her head
and caused an epidural bleed?

15:03.945 --> 15:05.614
Well, walk me through what you know.
Maybe I can help.

15:06.239 --> 15:08.742
So, the mother said Keisha ran a bit
of a fever last week.

15:08.825 --> 15:11.453
But the pediatrician couldn't find
anything out of the ordinary.

15:11.536 --> 15:14.080
She was a little hypotensive
when I had Monique push the ketamine,

15:14.164 --> 15:15.957
but nothing to precipitate this...

15:16.041 --> 15:18.376
Ketamine? You mean etomidate, right?

15:19.336 --> 15:20.337
What?

15:20.920 --> 15:23.632
You had Monique push etomidate.
I heard you call it earlier.

15:23.715 --> 15:24.924
Yeah. It's right here in the chart.

15:26.926 --> 15:30.847
That's strange. I don't...
I don't know how I confused those two.

15:32.390 --> 15:35.560
Whatever, it doesn't matter,
there's no real clinical difference.

15:35.644 --> 15:37.270
You feeling all right, Nat?

15:37.354 --> 15:38.563
Any headaches or problems concentrating...

15:38.647 --> 15:39.856
I misspoke, Will.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.316
Let's not make a big deal out of it.

15:55.205 --> 15:56.998
What did you put in her side there?

15:57.707 --> 15:59.751
Well, your daughter's got
a collapsed lung.

15:59.834 --> 16:01.419
That tube's gonna help her breathe.

16:01.503 --> 16:03.546
So, how long until I'll be able
to get her out of here?

16:03.630 --> 16:06.549
It's gonna be a while. It'll be okay.

16:09.844 --> 16:11.137
Have you thought of a name yet?

16:11.221 --> 16:12.305
Not really.

16:13.348 --> 16:14.724
Okay, you don't need to do this right now,

16:14.808 --> 16:17.018
but before you leave you're gonna need
to fill out these forms,

16:17.102 --> 16:18.353
for the birth certificate.

16:20.105 --> 16:23.483
And we need to let your OB know
that you delivered already.

16:24.401 --> 16:25.777
If you give me a name...

16:25.860 --> 16:27.362
No, I didn't really have an OB.

16:28.947 --> 16:30.323
I mean, I had one,

16:30.407 --> 16:33.702
but they were all the way across town
near where the baby's father lives,

16:33.785 --> 16:35.537
and we recently split, so...

16:35.620 --> 16:37.372
Oh, I'm sorry.

16:39.165 --> 16:41.126
Here. I'll fill out as much as I can.

16:41.960 --> 16:43.420
Oh, your hand.

16:43.503 --> 16:45.130
Melissa, may I have some gauze, please?

16:51.177 --> 16:53.888
You know, I can't do any more than this
without getting you admitted.

16:53.972 --> 16:55.932
It's okay, I'm all right.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.684
You need to see a doctor,

16:57.767 --> 17:01.187
if for no other reason than to make sure
you've passed all your placenta.

17:01.271 --> 17:03.481
Dr. Marcel? Isn't that right?

17:03.565 --> 17:06.151
Please, don't separate me from my baby.

17:06.234 --> 17:07.610
She needs me with her.

17:07.694 --> 17:10.447
Hey.
How about we just get you registered?

17:10.530 --> 17:11.906
That way we can get you
out of these clothes

17:11.990 --> 17:13.700
and into something more comfortable.

17:13.783 --> 17:14.951
Then you can stay here with your child.

17:15.034 --> 17:17.537
Okay. Thank you.

17:17.620 --> 17:19.038
April here will scare you up some scrubs.

17:25.920 --> 17:28.423
I'm sorry, Dr. Marcel?
Mmmâ€“hmm.

17:28.506 --> 17:30.049
She really needs to be examined.

17:30.133 --> 17:33.803
Oh, relax, Sexton.
We just saved a baby's life.

17:33.887 --> 17:35.263
That's good news.

17:35.346 --> 17:37.599
Look, something seems off with Mom.

17:37.682 --> 17:38.850
Why's she so resistant
to being seen by a doctor?

17:38.933 --> 17:39.934
(SIGHS)

17:40.018 --> 17:42.729
Who knows? Maybe she took
a little somethingâ€“something

17:42.812 --> 17:44.272
to get her through the birth
and now she's afraid

17:44.355 --> 17:46.024
of having her baby taken away.

17:46.107 --> 17:48.443
I don't know. And neither do you.

17:48.526 --> 17:53.364
But if she didn't just deliver this baby,
it's our responsibility to find out.

17:53.448 --> 17:56.826
Maybe we could figure out a way
to draw her blood, check her HCG levels...

17:56.910 --> 17:57.911
Oh!

17:58.745 --> 18:02.332
You draw anyone's blood without consent,
that's considered assault.

18:02.415 --> 18:04.918
Now, I don't know about you,
but I like being a doctor.

18:05.001 --> 18:06.002
And not going to jail.

18:06.628 --> 18:09.214
If you won't help me,
I'll call DCFS in to interview her.

18:11.174 --> 18:13.676
Nicole's a righty, by the way.
So?

18:14.511 --> 18:18.389
So, if she actually injured her hand
while cutting the umbilical cord,

18:18.473 --> 18:21.226
wouldn't it more likely be
the free hand that got cut?

18:26.940 --> 18:28.608
Hey.
Hey.

18:28.691 --> 18:30.068
So, what's up?

18:30.151 --> 18:33.196
I understand you're considering
undergoing surgery to repair your wrist.

18:33.279 --> 18:34.322
Yes.

18:34.405 --> 18:38.451
As your oncologist, I need to strongly
urge you against that course of treatment.

18:38.535 --> 18:41.371
That's exactly what he said.
Did you tell her to say that?

18:41.454 --> 18:42.622
Absolutely not.

18:43.248 --> 18:47.460
DR. SINGH: Your immune system
is profoundly compromised by the chemo.

18:47.544 --> 18:50.171
The risk of postâ€“surgical infection
is very high.

18:50.255 --> 18:54.092
I advise against even minor surgery,
unless absolutely necessary.

18:54.175 --> 18:55.385
This is absolutely necessary

18:55.468 --> 18:57.887
because I'm making a Baked Alaska
for my daughter.

18:57.971 --> 19:01.099
And I cannot do that
with, like, a cast on my hand.

19:01.182 --> 19:04.394
Caroline, Robin would happily celebrate
her birthday

19:04.477 --> 19:06.646
with a supermarket cupcake
if she knew what the risks were.

19:06.729 --> 19:09.524
This isn't about what Robin wants.
This is about what I want.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.528
Why don't I give you two some privacy?

19:16.698 --> 19:17.699
What?

19:17.782 --> 19:21.452
How about we just have them put
a temp cast on it overnight.

19:21.536 --> 19:24.163
And then we can mull over the pluses
and the minuses...

19:24.247 --> 19:27.292
Dr. Charles? Sorry to interrupt,
but you've been requested down in the ED.

19:28.001 --> 19:29.002
(SIGHS)

19:29.085 --> 19:30.628
Yeah, they specifically asked
for you, Dr. Charles.

19:31.254 --> 19:33.965
Go, Daniel. Go, please.

19:37.218 --> 19:38.553
Heather?

19:38.636 --> 19:40.763
Can you do me a favor
and please try and make sure

19:40.847 --> 19:43.016
she does not get cleared
for surgery until I get back.

19:43.766 --> 19:44.893
Daniel...
Please.

19:44.976 --> 19:47.186
I just wanna make sure she doesn't make
any rash decisions.

19:47.270 --> 19:48.605
Thank you.

19:49.856 --> 19:50.857
(SIGHS)

19:50.940 --> 19:52.233
For the record,

19:52.317 --> 19:54.110
CCI neither condones nor endorses

19:54.193 --> 19:56.362
the preâ€“emptive precipitation
of clinical death.

19:56.446 --> 19:59.157
That said, we are a service company...
Sure.

20:00.742 --> 20:03.328
Hope the parents aren't gonna be
too much of an impediment on this.

20:03.411 --> 20:06.164
I don't wanna step on anyone's toes here,
but time really is of the essence.

20:06.247 --> 20:08.082
The second he is declared dead,
we need to start.

20:09.125 --> 20:10.960
Is this what you're using to freeze him?

20:11.044 --> 20:13.796
We don't freeze anyone.
We're gonna vitrify him.

20:14.589 --> 20:17.050
We replace his blood
with a medicalâ€“grade antifreeze.

20:17.133 --> 20:19.886
As soon as his body temp hits
minus 124 degrees Celsius,

20:19.969 --> 20:23.139
the body's liquid rises so high
in viscosity, no molecule can budge.

20:24.974 --> 20:26.059
Takes about three hours.

20:26.142 --> 20:28.144
You paged me?
Yeah.

20:28.227 --> 20:29.520
The parents wanted to speak with you.

20:32.649 --> 20:34.567
Mr. and Mrs. Shepard? Please.

20:36.319 --> 20:37.528
This is Dr. Charles.

20:37.612 --> 20:39.739
Why is no one stopping my boy
from doing this?

20:39.822 --> 20:41.115
Todd just turned 18.

20:41.199 --> 20:42.825
He can't make a decision
like this for himself.

20:42.909 --> 20:44.202
(ALARM BLARING)

20:44.994 --> 20:46.412
He's bradying down.

20:46.496 --> 20:47.705
What's that?

20:47.789 --> 20:50.083
His heart stopped.
Well, do something!

20:50.166 --> 20:51.918
I'm not legally authorized to.
BEA: Please!

20:53.002 --> 20:54.629
We only have so much time left with him!

20:54.712 --> 20:55.713
Well, we're not ready for him to die yet.

21:00.593 --> 21:03.930
Have you noticed any personality changes
in Shep since the diagnosis?

21:04.013 --> 21:05.014
I don't know...

21:06.265 --> 21:09.227
Has he been more impetuous, stubborn,
less willing to listen to reason?

21:11.562 --> 21:12.730
Yes, of course.

21:12.814 --> 21:14.607
I'm deeming the patient
decisionally incapacitated.

21:14.691 --> 21:17.527
As next of kin, you have the right
to make medical decisions on his behalf.

21:17.610 --> 21:19.070
Should we attempt to resuscitate him?
Yes! Do it!

21:19.153 --> 21:20.947
All right, get me a crash cart.
Start bagging!

21:22.407 --> 21:24.325
Quickâ€“look paddles.
Hey, give us some room!

21:33.543 --> 21:36.004
How long will he need to stay on support?

21:36.087 --> 21:39.132
Until the drugs work through his system.
A few more hours at least.

21:40.049 --> 21:41.050
Thank you, Doctor.

21:41.926 --> 21:42.927
Sure.

21:46.931 --> 21:48.307
Guess you guys rushed here for nothing.

21:49.475 --> 21:52.520
Well, transfer's already paid for,
so, we'll stand by, if it's all the same,

21:52.603 --> 21:53.604
just in case.

21:56.357 --> 21:57.900
You can hang in that room
for the time being.

22:00.486 --> 22:03.156
I didn't think you were
buying my personality change argument.

22:03.239 --> 22:06.075
Just erring on the side
of caution, you know?

22:06.159 --> 22:07.452
Give everybody a little more time.

22:07.535 --> 22:08.870
You made the right call.
CAROLINE: Thank you.

22:08.953 --> 22:10.747
I hope so.
So, what?

22:10.830 --> 22:13.833
You forbade me
from having the surgery? Really?

22:13.916 --> 22:16.169
So we get married and now I have to ask
for permission for stuff?

22:16.252 --> 22:18.129
Is that right?
I wasn't...

22:18.212 --> 22:19.213
Come here, come here.

22:22.467 --> 22:23.843
I'm not forbidding anything.

22:23.926 --> 22:25.303
I just want to make sure
that we have enough time

22:25.386 --> 22:26.804
to think this through.
I've thought about it.

22:26.888 --> 22:28.806
I want the surgery.
For a Baked Alaska?

22:28.890 --> 22:30.266
Yes.
Do you know how crazy that sounds?

22:30.349 --> 22:31.809
It's not about the Baked Alaska.

22:32.685 --> 22:35.980
It's about me showing love to the people
I care about the way I want to.

22:36.064 --> 22:37.648
Look, I know I'm not
the best cook in the world,

22:37.732 --> 22:39.233
but I can figure out a whisk.
I'll help you.

22:39.317 --> 22:41.110
No. No. No.
We'll do it together.

22:41.194 --> 22:42.195
No!

22:43.071 --> 22:46.199
Time is precious, Daniel,
and I don't wanna spend four weeks

22:46.282 --> 22:48.201
not being able to use my hand.

22:49.452 --> 22:51.287
You knew who I was
when you signed on for this.

22:51.370 --> 22:52.497
You knew who I was.

22:52.580 --> 22:55.833
No, this isn't what I signed up for.
You being reckless with your health.

22:55.917 --> 22:56.918
That wasn't the deal.

22:57.668 --> 22:58.961
There's too much to lose here.

22:59.045 --> 23:00.505
I think you're being a little selfish.

23:00.588 --> 23:02.048
So, now I'm being selfish. Really?

23:02.131 --> 23:03.800
I mean, I just found you again.

23:03.883 --> 23:05.718
I wanna have as much time
with you as possible.

23:05.802 --> 23:07.637
And I'm kinda hoping
you feel the same way.

23:07.720 --> 23:09.430
I do, but you know what?
This is my choice.

23:09.514 --> 23:11.057
Period. You hear that?

23:12.266 --> 23:13.267
Period.

23:16.145 --> 23:17.355
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)

23:17.438 --> 23:20.608
I tried to get her to let us
examine her, but she refused,

23:20.691 --> 23:22.902
and given the circumstances
of the delivery...

23:22.985 --> 23:25.404
No. You did the right thing
calling Child Services, April.

23:25.488 --> 23:26.489
It's what we're here for.

23:28.449 --> 23:30.451
Excuse me. Miss Burke?

23:32.328 --> 23:33.329
APRIL: Nicole?

23:33.913 --> 23:36.332
Hey, Nicole, you gotta wake up.

23:36.415 --> 23:37.458
We need to ask you a few questions.

23:38.126 --> 23:41.087
She was feeling pretty anxious
about her baby, so, I gave her Ativan.

23:41.170 --> 23:42.839
Should wear off in an hour or so.

23:42.922 --> 23:45.299
Melissa, will you notify us
when she wakes up?

23:45.383 --> 23:46.551
Of course.
Thank you.

23:49.595 --> 23:52.265
I cannot believe that you would
undermine me like that.

23:52.348 --> 23:53.349
Excuse me?

23:53.432 --> 23:55.518
You knew I was calling DCFS in
to talk to her.

23:55.601 --> 23:57.186
You sedated her on purpose.

23:57.270 --> 23:58.312
Please.

23:58.396 --> 24:02.400
You know what, you don't wanna help? Fine.
Just do me a favor, stay out of my way.

24:10.408 --> 24:12.160
Goodwin got you a lackey?

24:13.661 --> 24:16.581
What'd you do
to get such special treatment?

24:16.664 --> 24:19.584
I'm just training her, Doris.
It's not permanent.

24:19.667 --> 24:20.710
That's not what I heard.

24:21.752 --> 24:22.753
Huh.

24:23.421 --> 24:25.006
Good thing I checked these.

24:25.089 --> 24:26.632
Look how many had almost expired.
(SIGHS)

24:26.716 --> 24:28.801
You know, if you want, I could
rework things moving forward.

24:30.094 --> 24:31.929
Great.
So what's next?

24:32.805 --> 24:34.098
Actually, I'd love a cup of coffee.

24:34.182 --> 24:35.516
Okay, I'll run down to the cafeteria.

24:35.600 --> 24:37.560
I prefer Dark Matter coffee.

24:37.643 --> 24:39.312
There's one about twelve blocks from here.

24:39.395 --> 24:42.190
Why don't you go get me a red eye
and get yourself whatever you want.

24:42.273 --> 24:43.524
Thanks. I'll be back in a jiff.

24:45.526 --> 24:46.527
(SIGHS)

24:50.031 --> 24:52.909
Hey, uh, Keisha's father,
Darrell, arrived.

24:52.992 --> 24:54.535
Had a lot of questions.

24:54.619 --> 24:56.746
I know. I need to go talk to them.

24:56.829 --> 24:59.415
I'm not avoiding them.
I just don't have the answers yet.

25:00.249 --> 25:03.502
What'd her CT show?
Came back negative. No bleed.

25:03.586 --> 25:05.004
Bloodwork?

25:05.087 --> 25:08.382
Glucose and sodium are a little low,
but otherwise normal.

25:09.091 --> 25:10.551
I'm gonna do an LP,
make sure we're not looking

25:10.635 --> 25:11.928
at something like meningitis.

25:12.762 --> 25:15.389
Are you sure that's necessary?
Is she spiking a fever?

25:15.473 --> 25:18.017
Well, not today, but her mom said
she was last week,

25:18.100 --> 25:19.727
so, I gotta check it off my list.

25:19.810 --> 25:21.854
Hey, you want me
to take over Keisha for you?

25:21.938 --> 25:23.856
What? Why?

25:23.940 --> 25:26.150
It's... Nat, it's been a long week.

25:26.234 --> 25:27.693
You know, and you were
out of action for a while.

25:27.777 --> 25:30.029
I'd understand if you're
feeling a little rusty.

25:30.112 --> 25:32.240
Maybe you should look into that program
I mentioned earlier...

25:32.323 --> 25:33.950
This is because I misspoke, isn't it?

25:35.660 --> 25:38.204
You are fixated
on me getting my memory back.

25:39.372 --> 25:40.373
Why?

25:41.499 --> 25:43.834
Nat, I just want you to get better.
Nah, I don't think that's it.

25:45.253 --> 25:46.295
I think it's about you.

25:47.630 --> 25:49.674
You want me to remember
why I came to see you that night,

25:50.675 --> 25:51.926
so that maybe I'll...

25:54.220 --> 25:55.763
...tell you something you wanna hear.

25:56.472 --> 25:57.848
Natalie, no...
Stop it.

25:59.684 --> 26:00.685
I am fine.

26:01.477 --> 26:02.770
And I don't appreciate you talking

26:02.853 --> 26:04.855
to Dr. Abrams about
my health behind my back.

26:05.815 --> 26:08.025
Monique. Will you prep Keisha for an LP?
MONIQUE: Okay.

26:08.109 --> 26:10.194
Thanks.
Actually, Monique, hold off on that.

26:11.862 --> 26:13.990
I didn't want to have to tell you this,
but I'm taking over the patient.

26:15.366 --> 26:16.951
The parents have lost confidence in you.

26:17.576 --> 26:19.078
They brought their daughter in
to have a burn looked at,

26:19.161 --> 26:20.162
and now she's in a coma.

26:20.246 --> 26:23.666
Will, please don't do this.

26:24.250 --> 26:26.752
I'm sorry, they want you off the case.

26:34.593 --> 26:37.346
Twentyâ€“threeâ€“yearâ€“old female,
found down, intubated in the field,

26:37.430 --> 26:39.223
18 gauge in the left arm.
She's eviscerated.

26:39.307 --> 26:41.934
Baghdad!
Bowels wrapped in moist saline gauze.

26:42.018 --> 26:43.519
She's gotten 500 mils of crystalloid.

26:43.602 --> 26:45.313
MAGGIE: Let's go, everybody.
Let's go, let's go!

26:48.274 --> 26:52.987
All right. On my count. One, two, three.

26:54.322 --> 26:55.323
Get her on the monitors.

26:57.408 --> 27:00.119
APRIL: Heart rate's 130. BP's 72 over 44.

27:00.202 --> 27:03.497

27:03.581 --> 27:04.582
I got you.

27:05.458 --> 27:07.126
Open the hybrid.
Oh, man,

27:07.710 --> 27:09.712
her uterus is cut wide open.

27:10.963 --> 27:13.007
Looks like she was pregnant.
Wait, what? Where's the baby?

27:13.090 --> 27:15.217
Where's this woman's baby?
There was no baby onâ€“site.

27:15.801 --> 27:16.802
It had to have been Nicole.

27:16.886 --> 27:19.597
Okay. Okay, this woman who did this,
her name is Nicole Burke,

27:19.680 --> 27:21.223
she is in the NICU right now
with the baby.

27:21.307 --> 27:22.933
Come on, I'll show you.
Stop!

27:23.017 --> 27:25.353
Let the police do their job, Sexton!
Come here and help me retract.

27:25.436 --> 27:28.898
You have to go up there fast! Oh, my God.

27:28.981 --> 27:30.358
I need some more lab sponges.

27:30.441 --> 27:31.442
NURSE: Yes, Doctor.

27:37.323 --> 27:39.617
MARCEL: So, what do you think?
Can we save the uterus?

27:40.659 --> 27:43.079
I don't know. It's looking pretty ratty.

27:43.162 --> 27:44.246
Even if we can fix it,

27:44.330 --> 27:46.999
she'd run the risk of it rupturing
with a future pregnancy.

27:47.083 --> 27:48.292
I'd just do a hysterectomy.

27:49.543 --> 27:52.588
Well, she's only 23, and I'm not sure
her baby's gonna survive.

27:54.006 --> 27:55.007
I'm gonna try and save it.

27:55.633 --> 27:58.969
I'll go scrub, but for the record,
this is against my better judgment.

27:59.929 --> 28:03.099
You scrubbing in or not, Mags?
I'm coming!

28:04.141 --> 28:06.852
Oh, uh... Hey, Maggie, are you all right?

28:06.936 --> 28:08.020

I'm fine.

28:18.280 --> 28:19.657
Why does this keep happening?

28:20.533 --> 28:23.285
The drugs he took
are making his heart stop

28:23.369 --> 28:25.162
and until they clear his system...

28:27.081 --> 28:28.958
(CRYING)

28:35.923 --> 28:39.176
Feels like only yesterday we were waiting

28:39.260 --> 28:41.762
to see what college
he would get into and...

28:41.846 --> 28:42.847
Now?

28:44.557 --> 28:46.976
We just couldn't let him go through
with that plan of his, you know?

28:49.103 --> 28:50.563
The...

28:50.646 --> 28:55.526
The thought of his head just floating
in a canister in a warehouse somewhere...

28:58.237 --> 29:00.948
Shep told me that he tried to talk
to you two about this, is that right?

29:01.031 --> 29:02.032
Yeah.

29:03.117 --> 29:04.118
I don't know if it's any comfort,

29:04.201 --> 29:07.663
but I was genuinely impressed

29:07.746 --> 29:09.248
with how much thought
that he had put into this,

29:09.331 --> 29:11.125
and how much sense that it made to him.

29:12.918 --> 29:16.547
Please, Dr. Charles,
tell us what we're missing.

29:19.675 --> 29:21.135
Miss Shepard, I've been
doing this for a while.

29:22.052 --> 29:23.596
And on a good day,

29:23.679 --> 29:27.558
I'm just starting to think I might be
learning my way around the human mind.

29:29.101 --> 29:30.102
But trying to...

29:30.186 --> 29:33.022
To fathom the thinking of someone
who's confronting their own mortality?

29:34.106 --> 29:35.566
Unless you're the one who's looking down
that tunnel,

29:35.649 --> 29:37.234
I just... I don't know if it's possible.

29:39.445 --> 29:41.197
I think what we need to do
is try and listen,

29:42.114 --> 29:45.034
understand and respect
that it's their journey

29:45.117 --> 29:46.452
to... To go on alone.

29:47.620 --> 29:51.624
They got his heart back in rhythm.
You should go be with him.

29:58.005 --> 30:00.049
What we need to do?

30:02.468 --> 30:06.764
You give us the power to make a decision
and then judge us for making it?

30:07.765 --> 30:09.808
Mr. Shepard, believe me,
I'm... I'm not judging anybody.

30:17.024 --> 30:18.651
Anyone from rheumatology showed up yet?

30:18.734 --> 30:19.735
No.

30:19.818 --> 30:22.196
Lean on them, okay?
And run another set of labs.

30:22.279 --> 30:23.697
MONIQUE: Mmmâ€“hmm.

30:23.781 --> 30:25.407
Oh, hey, there. Again.

30:27.159 --> 30:28.827
Hi, Owen.
Hi, Will.

30:29.662 --> 30:32.039
PHILLIP: After we got done in the park,

30:32.122 --> 30:33.874
we went to the movies,

30:33.958 --> 30:36.919
and then we figured we would
come here and wait for Mommy.

30:39.046 --> 30:40.297
Hey, Phillip...

30:40.381 --> 30:41.382
Yeah?

30:44.260 --> 30:46.804
Not so sure this is the best place
for kids, you know?

30:47.763 --> 30:50.432
Some scary stuff happens here,
and maybe they can't unsee.

30:50.516 --> 30:52.393
Oh, yeah. That's a good point.

30:53.352 --> 30:54.353
Um...

30:59.525 --> 31:03.737
There we go. Now there's nothing
to unsee, right?

31:14.081 --> 31:16.500
We told your supervisor we didn't want you
treating our daughter anymore...

31:16.584 --> 31:17.585
I know, I just need

31:17.668 --> 31:19.211
to check one last thing.
Dr. Manning?

31:20.462 --> 31:22.047
I'll have to ask you to stay away
from this patient.

31:22.673 --> 31:23.841
I was wrong. Okay?

31:23.924 --> 31:26.343
Etomidate and ketamine
are not just the same thing.

31:26.427 --> 31:30.931
A big difference is that etomidate
unmasks adrenal insufficiencies...

31:31.015 --> 31:32.099
While ketamine doesn't.

31:32.182 --> 31:33.183
Yes.

31:34.935 --> 31:36.812
Do you see the pigment spots
on Keisha's foot?

31:37.813 --> 31:41.859
They are a sign that her adrenal glands
are not producing enough cortisol.

31:41.942 --> 31:44.570
100 milligrams of hydrocortisone.
I don't understand.

31:44.653 --> 31:46.488
Cortisol helps the body handle stress.

31:46.572 --> 31:49.199
In its absence, even the stress
of being examined by a doctor

31:49.283 --> 31:51.285
was enough to plummet Keisha into a coma.

31:54.538 --> 31:56.332
(MACHINE BEEPS)

31:56.415 --> 31:57.416
BP's improving.

31:59.126 --> 32:00.419
Her color's coming back.

32:00.502 --> 32:02.129
She's trying to open her eyes!

32:02.212 --> 32:03.547
Oh, my baby girl...

32:08.719 --> 32:09.928
She's superâ€“cold.

32:10.012 --> 32:11.388
I'm having trouble
keeping her pressure up.

32:11.472 --> 32:12.640
You need to pack her up now and get out.

32:13.307 --> 32:15.976
Told you it wasn't worth it.
Knot and I'm done.

32:16.060 --> 32:17.394
You're pushing it, Dr. Marcel.

32:17.478 --> 32:20.147
And there. Done.

32:21.607 --> 32:24.610
Looks better than I thought.
Let's tempâ€“close and get her upstairs.

32:24.693 --> 32:25.861
Open up a vac sponge.

32:28.822 --> 32:29.823
I need to take a minute.

32:33.952 --> 32:34.953
MARCEL: Mags.

32:37.956 --> 32:39.958

Hey.

32:51.929 --> 32:55.683
If you need to go home early,
I'm more than willing to cover for you.

33:00.646 --> 33:01.897
You cover for me?

33:03.691 --> 33:04.817
Your first day?

33:06.568 --> 33:10.322
(LAUGHING)

33:11.782 --> 33:13.867
A little constructive criticism, Paula,

33:16.370 --> 33:20.249
you have an insanely inflated sense
of your own capabilities.

33:22.251 --> 33:25.587
"You know, I'm certified doing this.
I did my dissertation on that."

33:26.338 --> 33:27.548
Please!

33:28.549 --> 33:29.633
I'm...
Get out.

33:33.387 --> 33:35.848
I'm sorry, but I refuse
to be spoken to like that.

33:36.932 --> 33:39.643
(SOBBING)

33:56.785 --> 33:57.786
Is she gonna make it?

33:58.787 --> 34:02.416
Yeah, she lost a lot of blood,
but, yeah, I'm hopeful.

34:02.499 --> 34:04.710
Do we know any more about what happened?

34:05.461 --> 34:07.045
The victim's name is Louisa Nash.

34:07.129 --> 34:09.006
She and the assailant were coâ€“workers.

34:09.089 --> 34:11.008
This morning,
Miss Burke invited Louisa over

34:11.091 --> 34:12.718
to give her some old baby clothes.

34:12.801 --> 34:14.178
When her guard was down,
she chloroformed her

34:14.261 --> 34:17.765
and forcibly removed the baby.
Who would ever do something like that?

34:18.640 --> 34:20.517
She lost her son recently to leukemia.

34:20.601 --> 34:22.936
Maybe she had some sort of
mental breakdown? I don't know.

34:24.313 --> 34:26.732
We were lucky and we got an anonymous tip
about Miss Burke.

34:26.815 --> 34:28.692
And that helped us find Louisa in time.

34:28.776 --> 34:30.319
Suspect's hand needs dressing.

34:30.402 --> 34:32.404
Is that something you can do here?
I got it.

34:41.079 --> 34:42.873
Take care of my baby, okay?

34:45.042 --> 34:47.044
Tell him I'll come for him
as soon as I can.

34:51.048 --> 34:52.966
It's getting to be a bit of a circus.

34:54.426 --> 34:55.427
Gwen? Gwen?
Excuse me?

34:55.511 --> 34:57.012
Here. I'll take you out the back way.

35:13.821 --> 35:16.532
What's going on?
They're withdrawing support.

35:18.951 --> 35:21.578
My wife and I decided we're going to honor
our son's wishes.

35:23.413 --> 35:26.333
This way, maybe, someday,
we'll get our son back.

35:32.589 --> 35:33.882
Time of death, 19:42.

36:07.541 --> 36:09.960
So, I'm thinking
this might have been precipitated

36:10.043 --> 36:11.879
by some kind of underlying cause.

36:11.962 --> 36:15.340
Maybe Addison's Disease? I'm gonna
have endocrinology come down and see her.

36:17.092 --> 36:18.802
I thought it was clear
I was gonna be the primary.

36:19.553 --> 36:21.930
I'm sorry, but once I realized
what caused her to crash,

36:22.014 --> 36:24.516
I had to act quickly.
I mean, Keisha could have died.

36:25.976 --> 36:27.436
Oh, my ride's here.

36:30.647 --> 36:33.942
Adrenal crisis should have been
on your differential from the start.

36:35.152 --> 36:36.528
It was an odd presentation.

36:37.571 --> 36:38.906
Or you just weren't thinking straight.

36:41.325 --> 36:43.243
I'm gonna want to oversee
all your cases moving forward,

36:43.327 --> 36:46.914
until we know for sure your TBI
isn't adversely affecting your patients.

36:46.997 --> 36:50.626
Are you serious?
There's nothing wrong with me.

36:51.752 --> 36:53.337
You don't have the authority.

36:54.838 --> 36:56.214
I was hoping we could do this offâ€“book.

36:58.425 --> 37:00.886
If not, we can formalize it
with Lanik and Goodwin.

37:00.969 --> 37:01.970
I'm happy to talk to them.

37:04.723 --> 37:05.724
Natalie,

37:07.559 --> 37:08.560
it's for your own protection.

37:10.604 --> 37:13.106
Why do I feel like you're punishing me
for something else?

37:22.491 --> 37:24.785
Hi, come here. (GRUNTS)

37:26.119 --> 37:27.621
So, you ready to go?
PHILLIP: Yeah.

37:28.705 --> 37:29.706
Yes.

37:36.838 --> 37:39.591
Louisa? Can you open your eyes for me?

37:43.553 --> 37:44.554
Hey.

37:44.638 --> 37:48.308
You're at Gaffney Chicago
Medical Center, in the ICU.

37:48.392 --> 37:50.185
You sustained some injuries
that required us

37:50.268 --> 37:53.230
to perform extensive surgery,
but you are okay.

37:54.690 --> 37:56.233
Would you like to meet your baby girl?

37:57.275 --> 37:58.652
Uhâ€“huh.

38:07.077 --> 38:08.245
Here she is.

38:15.961 --> 38:18.797
We got lucky, the police
finding her in time.

38:21.049 --> 38:22.509
Can I trust you to keep a secret?

38:23.552 --> 38:24.720
Yeah. What?

38:27.848 --> 38:30.308
You know how that monster was so antsy
to get out of here earlier?

38:30.392 --> 38:31.393
Mmmâ€“hmm.

38:31.476 --> 38:33.520
Well, Dr. Marcel gave her enough Ativan

38:33.603 --> 38:36.064
to knock her out, and while she was,

38:36.148 --> 38:38.817
he drew some blood
and had her HCG levels checked

38:38.900 --> 38:41.319
to see if she really delivered that baby.

38:41.403 --> 38:43.488
What?
You can't tell anyone, April.

No, I don't.

38:58.003 --> 39:00.589
Yeah. She said, and I quote,

"the ED wasn't a healthy environment"
for her.

39:03.091 --> 39:04.968
You know, I had a feeling
that she couldn't cut it.

39:05.052 --> 39:08.013
You chased her off, Maggie.
And I told you

39:08.096 --> 39:10.140
that I don't need the help.

39:10.223 --> 39:11.308
You're being stubborn.

I have a hospital to run.

to treat you medically,

off my plate.
