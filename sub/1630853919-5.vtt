WEBVTT

00:28.028 --> 00:29.904
<i>What is it that haunts you?</i>

00:31.114 --> 00:34.617
<i>Whose eyes peer back at you from the dark?</i>

01:28.296 --> 01:29.964
Yeah!

01:34.511 --> 01:35.720
Is that all you got?

02:05.041 --> 02:06.960
Winner, King.

02:19.556 --> 02:21.141
Out of my way.

03:44.891 --> 03:45.725
Jin?

03:46.434 --> 03:48.311
How you feeling?

03:50.021 --> 03:52.065
Please…

03:52.148 --> 03:53.733
…no lectures.

03:54.359 --> 03:58.196
I don't wanna hear about
being too young, too small.

03:58.279 --> 04:01.324
"Shouldn't have fought in the tournament.
Should've been more--"

04:01.407 --> 04:02.242
Xiaoyu,

04:03.284 --> 04:05.954
the doctor said
it's just a slight concussion.

04:06.454 --> 04:07.372
You'll be fine.

04:08.164 --> 04:10.083
And I'm not here to lecture you.

04:10.708 --> 04:14.837
I'm just tired of always having to defend
my choice to fight competitively,

04:15.463 --> 04:16.422
because…

04:17.257 --> 04:19.217
-Because you're a woman?

04:20.927 --> 04:21.761
Yeah.

04:21.844 --> 04:25.098
First person to teach me martial arts…

04:26.641 --> 04:28.226
…was a woman,

04:29.018 --> 04:35.108
and, uh, she was stronger
than anyone I've ever met.

04:35.733 --> 04:37.277
Your mother?

04:38.111 --> 04:41.406
Wait. She was the strongest?

04:42.240 --> 04:43.241
She is…

04:45.410 --> 04:46.661
Hmm.

04:47.495 --> 04:50.248
That's why
you were always so closed off.

04:51.541 --> 04:52.792
At school, I mean.

04:53.584 --> 04:57.171
For, um, as long as I can remember,

04:58.131 --> 05:00.508
I've been training for this tournament.

05:01.676 --> 05:03.553
Training to avenge her.

05:06.180 --> 05:07.890
Although, it would have been nice…

05:12.520 --> 05:13.938
It's okay, Jin.

05:15.648 --> 05:16.774
We can be friends now.

05:23.406 --> 05:25.325
Jin!

05:27.910 --> 05:29.037
What the hell?

05:29.912 --> 05:31.664
It's okay, tough guy.

05:32.248 --> 05:33.082
He's gone.

05:34.250 --> 05:35.084
Hmm.

05:42.925 --> 05:45.595
<i>How is this tournament</i>
<i>different from the previous for you?</i>

05:45.678 --> 05:50.933
<i>For starters, I just had</i>
<i>to fight a karate-practicing grizzly bear.</i>

05:51.017 --> 05:53.186
<i>And I'm about to fight a jaguar man.</i>

05:53.811 --> 05:56.773
<i>So I guess this time around,</i>
<i>anything goes.</i>

05:57.899 --> 05:59.025
Hmm.

06:00.276 --> 06:03.446
Here to study your future opponent?

06:03.529 --> 06:06.324
My people have recently discovered

06:06.407 --> 06:11.704
that King is not who we thought him to be.

06:11.788 --> 06:12.663
What?

06:13.289 --> 06:17.251
King, who was also a formidable fighter,

06:18.044 --> 06:21.589
was killed… by Ogre.

06:22.548 --> 06:25.093
So you don't know who that is?

06:36.312 --> 06:39.690
Had it not been for the power
of the Devil Gene,

06:40.733 --> 06:46.197
Paul Phoenix
would have defeated your father.

06:47.198 --> 06:49.492
Pay close attention

06:50.618 --> 06:53.538
not only to what wins the fight

06:54.664 --> 06:58.584
but also what loses it.

07:00.378 --> 07:04.632
You're not gonna bully me around the ring
like you did your last opponent.

07:04.715 --> 07:09.429
<i>Paul Phoenix versus King!</i>

07:12.932 --> 07:13.766
Begin!

07:37.457 --> 07:41.002
Damn. You're as tough
as you are creepy.

08:35.223 --> 08:40.895
Now you know who you must defeat.

08:42.980 --> 08:45.942
<i>Winner by knockout, King!</i>

09:02.542 --> 09:08.130
<i>You should be seeing</i>
<i>a live feed of Ogre's cell now.</i>

09:08.214 --> 09:10.883
Whether or not
I can remotely see it

09:10.967 --> 09:13.594
doesn't concern me, Bosconovitch.

09:14.428 --> 09:16.472
Will it hold him?

09:17.056 --> 09:19.767
<i>The cell will hold that beast</i>

09:19.850 --> 09:23.271
<i>for as long as it takes</i>
<i>to learn his secrets.</i>

09:23.896 --> 09:27.775
<i>Has the pendant shown any signs?</i>

09:27.858 --> 09:29.026
Hmm.

09:30.653 --> 09:31.612
No.

09:31.696 --> 09:35.324
<i>If Ogre is not drawn to Kazama</i>

09:35.408 --> 09:38.452
<i>the way he did when he was a child…</i>

09:38.536 --> 09:43.249
Then we still have
much to learn about the Devil Gene.

09:44.458 --> 09:46.627
<i>Indeed, we do, sir.</i>

09:47.378 --> 09:50.006
<i>Indeed, we do.</i>

09:53.801 --> 09:54.635
Hmm?

10:08.858 --> 10:11.319
I want to know
what happened to my mother.

10:11.819 --> 10:15.656
And I want her pendant back now, Heihachi.

10:15.740 --> 10:20.161
The pendant is from a time and people

10:20.745 --> 10:24.540
well before Michelle Chang.

10:27.668 --> 10:29.170
What the hell?

10:43.017 --> 10:45.102
Grandfather, what are you doing?

10:45.895 --> 10:51.067
Do not waste your Kazama empathy
on this wannabe assassin.

10:51.150 --> 10:52.860
Assassin?

10:52.943 --> 10:54.028
Are you kidding?

10:54.612 --> 10:57.907
You, leave, now!

11:00.910 --> 11:02.578
I'll make sure she leaves.

11:03.996 --> 11:07.917
You have a tournament to win.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.461
And you have a tournament to run.

11:11.295 --> 11:12.463
I'll take care of it.

11:13.172 --> 11:15.007
You won't see her again.

11:27.561 --> 11:31.691
I don't need help from another Mishima.

11:32.233 --> 11:33.067
-What?

11:33.651 --> 11:35.152
It all makes sense now.

11:35.653 --> 11:37.905
I heard you call him "grandfather."

11:37.988 --> 11:42.076
You… you're the son of Kazuya Mishima.

11:42.576 --> 11:44.036
You should leave.

11:44.120 --> 11:48.582
I'm not leaving
until I recover my mother's pendant

11:49.166 --> 11:52.294
and find out what happened to her.

11:52.962 --> 11:54.046
Pendant?

11:55.172 --> 11:57.049
You've seen it, haven't you?

11:57.133 --> 12:02.221
My mother was determined to make sure
the pendant was used for good,

12:02.805 --> 12:06.308
and Heihachi stole it from her.

12:06.392 --> 12:11.313
Heihachi got it from some lowlife
who got it from the bottom of a lake.

12:11.856 --> 12:16.360
After my mother hid it there,
trying to keep it away from him.

12:17.820 --> 12:21.115
Heihachi will only use its power for evil.

12:22.199 --> 12:26.328
Heihachi's trying to help me
rid the world of someone.

12:27.037 --> 12:30.416
Of something truly evil.

12:30.499 --> 12:31.542
The Ogre?

12:33.461 --> 12:39.258
Who do you think
unleashed it on all of us?

12:39.842 --> 12:41.260
What?

12:41.844 --> 12:47.850
You're saying Heihachi released Ogre
into the world?

12:47.933 --> 12:50.644
That's what my mother believed.

12:51.312 --> 12:55.107
Ogre killed my mother.

12:57.276 --> 13:00.070
That should just make you
more determined

13:00.905 --> 13:04.033
to prevent Heihachi
from using the pendant.

13:05.117 --> 13:05.993
You'll…

13:08.204 --> 13:09.538
get the pendant back.

13:10.915 --> 13:11.957
What?

13:12.041 --> 13:13.459
After the tournament.

13:15.044 --> 13:16.212
I'll see to it.

13:19.048 --> 13:21.383
After I fight that masked freak.

13:39.026 --> 13:43.447
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>using a wrestling fighting style,</i>

13:44.114 --> 13:45.783
<i>King!</i>

13:47.034 --> 13:51.455
<i>And using Mishima-Style Fighting Karate,</i>

13:52.039 --> 13:54.250
<i>Jin Kazama!</i>

13:56.752 --> 13:58.170
After the tournament.

13:59.797 --> 14:00.840
I'll see to it.

14:01.632 --> 14:04.426
After I fight that masked freak.

14:04.510 --> 14:05.427
King?

14:06.011 --> 14:09.974
You have more in common with him
than you realize.

14:11.016 --> 14:12.476
The original King,

14:12.560 --> 14:16.647
the man who saved this King
from a life on the streets,

14:17.565 --> 14:21.193
someone who he cared about,
like you did your mother,

14:21.861 --> 14:24.029
was also killed by Ogre.

14:25.197 --> 14:29.660
Of course,
you're here fighting for revenge,

14:31.120 --> 14:34.373
and King's here to win the money
to fund an orphanage.

14:35.040 --> 14:39.295
<i>So maybe you don't have</i>
<i>that much in common.</i>

14:40.796 --> 14:41.714
Begin!

15:15.664 --> 15:16.665
Hmm.

15:34.808 --> 15:39.063
…was also killed by Ogre.

15:39.146 --> 15:43.609
Of course,
you're here fighting for revenge.

16:10.594 --> 16:12.179
Hmm.

16:17.059 --> 16:18.143
Get up, Kazama!

16:19.520 --> 16:21.897
Get up, man. On your feet.

17:09.653 --> 17:10.821
-Whoa!

17:10.904 --> 17:11.989
Yes!

17:12.072 --> 17:14.533
<i>Winner, Jin Kazama!</i>

17:16.076 --> 17:18.620
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

17:18.704 --> 17:24.084
<i>winner and the new King of Iron Fist,</i>

17:24.668 --> 17:26.879
<i>Jin Kazama!</i>

17:41.894 --> 17:43.604
Prize money's all yours.

17:44.271 --> 17:46.690
-I don't want anything to do with it.

17:51.195 --> 17:53.072
Do good with it, okay?

17:54.448 --> 17:57.284
Build that orphanage,
whatever you were planning.

18:13.592 --> 18:19.098
Kazama, in order to be King of Iron Fist,

18:20.265 --> 18:25.771
you… must defeat one final opponent.

18:26.605 --> 18:28.690
Me.

18:31.902 --> 18:36.865
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>we have an additional bout.</i>

18:36.949 --> 18:42.412
<i>Jin Kazama will fight</i>
<i>Heihachi Mishima.</i>

18:49.169 --> 18:50.629
I don't like this.

18:50.712 --> 18:54.466
Jin's barely standing from his last fight.

18:56.426 --> 19:02.266
<i>For the title,</i>
<i>King of Iron Fist, uh,</i>

19:03.142 --> 19:08.355
<i>Jin Kazama versus Heihachi Mishima.</i>

19:09.231 --> 19:12.317
You have failed yourself,

19:12.860 --> 19:14.903
failed your mother,

19:15.571 --> 19:19.283
and you have failed my teachings.

19:20.284 --> 19:26.832
Ogre… won't waste his time on you.

19:27.791 --> 19:31.128
What happened
before Ogre arrived that night?

19:31.795 --> 19:33.714
Had you been fighting?

19:34.506 --> 19:37.634
Yes, against some bullies.

19:37.718 --> 19:42.514
Then… it's quite possible
he sought to confront your power

19:42.598 --> 19:44.224
to absorb it.

19:44.308 --> 19:46.894
My mother died because of me.

19:48.395 --> 19:52.149
You will honor her sacrifice

19:52.232 --> 19:57.696
by drawing out and confronting Ogre.

19:58.322 --> 20:04.161
You're saying Heihachi
released Ogre into the world?

20:04.244 --> 20:07.372
That's what my mother believed.

20:09.791 --> 20:12.711
Did you unleash Ogre?

20:12.794 --> 20:16.215
Does… it… matter?

20:16.298 --> 20:17.966
If you did,

20:18.800 --> 20:22.763
then my mother and other good people died,

20:23.305 --> 20:25.015
not because of him

20:25.849 --> 20:28.227
but because of you.

20:29.436 --> 20:35.734
Apparently, you've learned
all I can teach you.

20:36.610 --> 20:40.489
Challenge… accepted.

20:41.281 --> 20:42.449
Begin!

22:02.195 --> 22:08.118
Either Ogre appears,
or I'll kill you myself.

23:07.010 --> 23:07.928
Jin.

23:31.034 --> 23:34.413
Remember, you can counter
any opponent's size and strength

23:34.496 --> 23:36.456
with surprise and technique.

24:08.321 --> 24:11.783
Kazama Technique.

24:12.367 --> 24:14.035
Such treachery.

24:15.078 --> 24:20.041
Maybe you're a Mishima after all.

24:20.125 --> 24:24.171
I learned from the best.

24:26.381 --> 24:33.013
And now you will fall
at the hands of the best.

25:06.546 --> 25:08.006
The pendant.

25:32.822 --> 25:34.199
Hmm.
