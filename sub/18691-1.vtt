01:27.304 --> 01:28.958
What's this about?

01:30.916 --> 01:32.092
Fine.

02:17.833 --> 02:20.575
Your Honor,
the prosecution has offered

02:20.618 --> 02:23.621
some... compelling evidence
in this case.

02:25.710 --> 02:29.105
Compelling until you look
at the facts objectively.

02:29.149 --> 02:33.283
If Eddie had actually stolen
the motorcycle,

02:33.327 --> 02:36.504
does it make sense that
he would remove his fingerprints

02:36.547 --> 02:38.723
and then leave
the motorcycle in plain view

02:38.767 --> 02:40.769
in his own front yard?

02:40.812 --> 02:42.945
They have an eyewitness,
Mr. Lee,

02:42.988 --> 02:45.643
who says he was looking out
his store window

02:45.687 --> 02:48.472
on the afternoon of March 22nd
when he saw

02:48.516 --> 02:50.648
a young male steal
the motorcycle.

02:50.692 --> 02:53.173
Now he identified the male
as Eddie.

02:53.216 --> 02:56.001
But on the date of the theft,
March 22,

02:56.045 --> 02:58.743
the low winter sun
was shining directly

02:58.787 --> 03:01.137
into the windows of Mr.
Lee's store, as you can see

03:01.181 --> 03:03.531
in this the diagram
from the Sun Tracker app.

03:03.574 --> 03:06.882
I'd like to submit this
as defense exhibit one.

03:10.190 --> 03:12.322
It wouldn't have been possible
to see anything

03:12.366 --> 03:14.759
but a silhouette
in the glare of the sun.

03:14.803 --> 03:16.283
How can you assume that?

03:16.326 --> 03:17.893
I visited
the store three days later

03:17.936 --> 03:18.981
and took photos, Your Honor.

03:21.940 --> 03:24.639
Based on the evidence,
there's no reason

03:24.682 --> 03:25.901
he should be
in this courtroom today.

03:28.730 --> 03:30.775
Thank you, Ms. Plainview.

03:30.819 --> 03:31.820
Thank you, Your Honor.

03:46.313 --> 03:48.271
The court finds
no grounds for a trial.

03:49.881 --> 03:51.796
Case dismissed.

03:51.840 --> 03:53.058
Thank you, Your Honor.

04:14.645 --> 04:16.298
Ms. Plainview,
I didn't see you

04:16.343 --> 04:17.866
at the parent-grad brunch.

04:17.909 --> 04:20.260
I couldn't get out of work.
How was it?

04:20.303 --> 04:21.652
Kind of boring,

04:21.696 --> 04:24.394
but your daughter
looked super hot.

04:24.438 --> 04:25.482
Okay, Steve.

04:29.399 --> 04:31.445
There you are.

04:31.488 --> 04:33.360
Look who's finally home.

04:33.403 --> 04:35.362
I'm so sorry I couldn't make it
to the brunch.

04:35.405 --> 04:37.364
I'm used to doing things
on my own.

04:37.407 --> 04:41.542
I really thought I'd make it,
but we ran late.

04:41.585 --> 04:43.544
I brought something
to make it up to you.

04:43.587 --> 04:46.111
Sushi from your favorite place.

04:46.155 --> 04:48.897
No thanks.
I'm going out with Sylvie.

04:48.940 --> 04:50.333
Again?

04:50.377 --> 04:53.945
You two went out last night.

04:53.989 --> 04:56.731
And you came home awfully late,
by the way.

04:56.774 --> 04:59.995
Mom, it was like...
midnight.

05:00.038 --> 05:02.737
It was like... 4:00 a.m.

05:02.780 --> 05:04.565
I checked the clock.

05:04.608 --> 05:06.741
Well, we were just hanging
out at Sylvie's.

05:06.784 --> 05:08.699
A couple of high school girls
on graduation night

05:08.743 --> 05:10.658
just hanging around house?

05:10.701 --> 05:12.616
Hard to imagine.

05:12.660 --> 05:16.098
Well, what can I tell you?
You raised a boring child.

05:16.141 --> 05:19.362
Yo, Plain Jane.
Oh, hi, Ms. Plainview.

05:19.406 --> 05:20.798
Hi, Sylvie.

05:20.842 --> 05:22.844
Did I leave
my blue sweater here?

05:22.887 --> 05:24.367
- Check my room.
- [Clicks tongue]

05:28.632 --> 05:30.808
I was hoping
that maybe you and I

05:30.852 --> 05:33.202
could spend some time
together this summer

05:33.245 --> 05:34.682
before you go to school,
just the two of us.

05:37.554 --> 05:42.864
Between work and law school,
I know I haven't been as...

05:42.907 --> 05:44.822
available as I wanted to be.

05:44.866 --> 05:46.389
It is what it is.

05:46.433 --> 05:47.869
Nope, not there.

05:47.912 --> 05:49.523
All right, let's go.

05:49.566 --> 05:51.176
Are you hanging with us tonight, Ms.
Plainview?

05:51.220 --> 05:52.526
Really?

05:52.569 --> 05:54.397
She's kidding.

05:54.441 --> 05:56.791
- Uh, no, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

05:56.834 --> 05:58.009
Let's go.

05:58.053 --> 06:00.403
Come on!
Shut up.

06:10.457 --> 06:12.372
A shocking story
developing right now

06:12.415 --> 06:14.852
here at Palisades Beach
where early this morning,

06:14.896 --> 06:17.289
the police discovered the body of
a popular high school teacher.

06:17.333 --> 06:19.422
It's too soon to tell what the motive might have been

06:19.466 --> 06:21.250
or why this horrible crime
took place.

06:49.104 --> 06:51.672
Julie?

06:51.715 --> 06:54.326
Hope you didn't stay out
all night.

06:54.370 --> 06:55.153
Julie?

07:07.427 --> 07:08.776
Good morning.

07:08.819 --> 07:10.430
Hey, grab a bowl, sleepy face.

07:10.473 --> 07:11.866
I made oatmeal.

07:11.909 --> 07:12.736
Thank you.

07:14.651 --> 07:16.131
Did you have fun last night?

07:16.174 --> 07:19.047
Steve Guiler
and his friends showed up,

07:19.090 --> 07:21.528
and they were acting
like total idiots.

07:21.571 --> 07:25.314
Mom, they are such children.
I can't wait till college.

07:25.357 --> 07:27.447
[Laughs]

07:27.490 --> 07:29.710
Oh, I hate to break it
to you, sweetheart,

07:29.753 --> 07:31.755
but boys don't automatically
turn into men

07:31.799 --> 07:32.713
when they get to college.

07:34.541 --> 07:36.934
So, do you want to go to yoga?

07:36.978 --> 07:39.807
Really?

07:39.850 --> 07:41.461
You wouldn't be embarrassed
to be seen with your mom?

07:43.114 --> 07:44.855
I need a ride.

07:44.899 --> 07:47.336
And, uh, you could
use some exercise.

07:47.379 --> 07:49.207
I'm not sure how to take that.

07:49.251 --> 07:50.600
You deserve some you time.

07:52.341 --> 07:53.777
Nice save.

07:53.821 --> 07:55.518
[Laughs]
No you're not.

07:55.562 --> 07:56.780
Look at your abs, Mom.

07:56.824 --> 07:57.781
Mm-hmm.

08:08.357 --> 08:09.967
- Howdy.
- Good morning.

08:10.011 --> 08:11.142
Ellen Plainview?

08:11.186 --> 08:12.840
Yes.

08:12.883 --> 08:13.841
And this must be Julie.

08:15.843 --> 08:17.409
Can I help you?

08:17.453 --> 08:19.237
Detective Vicky Ogawa.

08:20.935 --> 08:23.720
My partner, Detective Hamer.

08:23.764 --> 08:25.069
Detective Hamer.

08:25.113 --> 08:26.854
Morning.

08:26.897 --> 08:28.420
You Julie Plainview?

08:29.857 --> 08:31.336
Yes.

08:31.380 --> 08:33.121
I'd like to ask you
a few questions.

08:33.164 --> 08:35.558
- Mom?
- Detective, what is this about?

08:35.602 --> 08:38.342
Where were you the night before last...
Thursday night?

08:38.386 --> 08:40.563
I was at my friend
Sylvie's house.

08:44.174 --> 08:46.047
And you were there all night?

08:46.090 --> 08:48.005
Yeah, I came home
around midnight.

08:48.049 --> 08:49.877
Can you verify?

08:49.920 --> 08:51.618
Why are you asking?

08:51.661 --> 08:53.402
Is there any reason
you're not answering?

08:53.445 --> 08:55.970
The truth is she came in
a little after 4:00 a.m.

08:56.013 --> 08:58.233
Now tell me why you're asking.

08:58.276 --> 09:00.844
Do you know a man
by the name of Gene Dutton?

09:00.888 --> 09:03.499
Yeah, he teaches
at North Shore High.

09:03.543 --> 09:06.197
He was my English teacher
and my tennis coach.

09:06.241 --> 09:08.591
And can you tell me when
you were with him last?

09:08.635 --> 09:11.768
- With him?
- Detective, what is this about?

09:11.812 --> 09:15.250
I saw him at school
a few days ago, I guess.

09:15.293 --> 09:17.252
Vicki?

09:17.295 --> 09:20.603
Julie, why don't you
turn around for me?

09:20.647 --> 09:22.039
What?

09:22.083 --> 09:24.564
You have the right
to remain silent.

09:24.607 --> 09:26.304
I suggest you use it.

09:26.348 --> 09:28.219
Wait a minute, what is going on?
What's happening?

09:28.263 --> 09:30.178
Ms. Plainview, your
daughter is under arrest.

09:30.221 --> 09:33.398
- For what?
- First-degree murder.

09:33.442 --> 09:35.749
This is crazy, my daughter
wouldn't hurt a housefly.

09:35.792 --> 09:37.489
What makes you think
she killed somebody?

09:37.533 --> 09:39.753
Enough evidence to suggest
probable cause.

09:39.796 --> 09:41.798
Now, we'll explain more
down at the station,

09:41.842 --> 09:43.365
and you can follow
in your own car.

10:10.261 --> 10:12.350
When can I talk to my daughter?

10:12.394 --> 10:14.222
It shouldn't be long.

10:14.265 --> 10:16.398
They can't question her
without me present.

10:16.441 --> 10:18.356
That's up to the detectives,
ma'am.

10:18.400 --> 10:20.576
That's up to the law.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.317
Do you honestly not know that?

10:31.848 --> 10:33.545
Hamer: You're under arrest for attempted murder,

10:33.589 --> 10:35.460
Mrs. Plainview.

10:35.504 --> 10:38.028
Security camera footage
places you at the crime scene.

10:38.072 --> 10:40.161
The victim was having an affair
with your husband.

10:40.204 --> 10:42.163
Ellen: This is crazy.
I had nothing to do with it.

10:42.206 --> 10:44.382
Man:
How do you plead?

10:44.426 --> 10:46.210
Ellen:
I'd like to handle my own defense, Your Honor.

10:46.254 --> 10:48.386
I can't leave my life.
In the hands of a stranger

11:06.187 --> 11:07.101
Got it.

11:09.190 --> 11:10.539
You can go in now.

11:10.582 --> 11:12.193
Down that hallway,
first door on the right.

11:20.157 --> 11:23.247
What's going on?
What is this all about?

11:23.291 --> 11:26.816
Somebody killed Mr. Dutton,
and they think it was me.

11:26.860 --> 11:28.862
Why?
Why would they think that?

11:28.905 --> 11:31.255
I don't know.
They said they have evidence.

11:31.299 --> 11:32.909
This was Thursday night, right?

11:32.953 --> 11:34.476
You said you were with
Sylvie Thursday night.

11:34.519 --> 11:35.956
I was.

11:35.999 --> 11:38.741
Mommy, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.

11:38.785 --> 11:41.265
I know.
I know, sweetie.

11:41.309 --> 11:42.963
Hi, Ms. Plainview.

11:44.834 --> 11:47.010
Get you anything?
Coffee, water?

11:47.054 --> 11:49.186
A water for my daughter, please.

11:49.230 --> 11:50.884
Sure.

11:50.927 --> 11:52.624
- Where you going?
- Girl wants some water.

11:52.668 --> 11:53.538
Later.

11:57.107 --> 11:58.761
Julie.

11:58.805 --> 12:00.720
I'm going to ask you
the same thing

12:00.763 --> 12:02.243
I ask everybody
who sits in that chair.

12:04.767 --> 12:07.770
Do you have anything
you want to tell me?

12:07.814 --> 12:09.424
About what?

12:09.467 --> 12:12.470
Well, we can start
with Gene Dutton.

12:12.514 --> 12:14.690
He's my teacher.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.779
Well, his wife said

12:16.823 --> 12:19.869
there was a romantic interest
on your part,

12:19.913 --> 12:21.218
that you'd been harassing him.

12:21.262 --> 12:22.829
That's a lie.

12:22.872 --> 12:24.569
Did you meet with him
at Palisades Beach

12:24.613 --> 12:25.701
parking lot on Thursday night?

12:25.745 --> 12:27.398
No.

12:27.442 --> 12:28.791
Did you meet him
at any other time

12:28.835 --> 12:30.445
during the past 48 hours?

12:30.488 --> 12:31.620
No.

12:31.663 --> 12:33.317
Mm. Julie, see,

12:33.361 --> 12:35.580
that's where we have a problem.

12:35.624 --> 12:38.758
Because we found
your fingerprints in his car,

12:38.801 --> 12:41.804
and now we have an eyewitness
that places you at the scene

12:41.848 --> 12:43.371
at the same time
Dutton was killed.

12:43.414 --> 12:45.852
An eyewitness?
Who?

12:45.895 --> 12:48.419
An eyewitness.

12:48.463 --> 12:50.073
They're lying.
I wasn't there.

12:51.945 --> 12:53.207
How was he killed?

12:53.250 --> 12:54.817
Stabbed in the heart.

12:54.861 --> 12:56.036
A crime of passion.

12:58.690 --> 13:01.171
Julie, do me a quick favor.

13:01.215 --> 13:02.956
Could you just draw
a circle for me?

13:06.786 --> 13:08.439
What is this for?

13:08.483 --> 13:10.485
Well, we know the killer
was left-handed.

13:15.229 --> 13:17.187
I didn't kill Mr. Dutton.

13:17.231 --> 13:19.363
Well, I happen to believe
you did.

13:19.407 --> 13:21.104
[Pounds table]
Listen, girlie,

13:21.148 --> 13:22.714
you want me to get tough,

13:22.758 --> 13:25.369
you just keep acting
like a jerk.

13:25.413 --> 13:27.807
Detective, don't you ever talk
to my daughter that way again!

13:27.850 --> 13:30.070
Gene. Do you mind?

13:30.113 --> 13:31.636
Go ahead.

13:33.203 --> 13:34.639
I need to take a leak anyway.

13:40.863 --> 13:42.430
Sorry about that.

13:42.473 --> 13:44.519
Gene's a bit old-school.

13:44.562 --> 13:48.566
Still likes to play
good cop, bad cop.

13:48.610 --> 13:51.918
Julie, we just wanna find out
what happened, that's all.

13:51.961 --> 13:53.702
I don't know how my fingerprints

13:53.745 --> 13:56.096
could've gotten
in Mr. Dutton's car.

13:56.139 --> 13:58.533
I was at Sylvie's house.

13:58.576 --> 14:01.231
Yeah, you mentioned that.

14:01.275 --> 14:04.060
Problem is, we obtained video

14:04.104 --> 14:06.280
from a neighbor's
security camera

14:06.323 --> 14:09.457
showing Sylvie Garrett's car
leaving the area at 11:00 p.m.

14:09.500 --> 14:12.503
with two occupants inside.

14:12.547 --> 14:15.463
Did Sylvie leave you alone
at any time that evening?

14:15.506 --> 14:17.900
Not that I remember.

14:17.944 --> 14:19.859
Well, we'll check it out
with her,

14:19.902 --> 14:21.773
and if she confirms,
then that's that.

14:21.817 --> 14:23.514
I can assure you that Julie

14:23.558 --> 14:25.603
has never harmed
another human being

14:25.647 --> 14:27.475
in her entire life.

14:27.518 --> 14:30.217
Well, then we should be
wrapped up real quick then.

14:30.260 --> 14:32.349
Now, we just need a DNA sample

14:32.393 --> 14:35.309
and we'll be all done, okay?

14:35.352 --> 14:36.266
You can wait outside.

14:39.008 --> 14:40.357
Don't worry, honey.

14:40.401 --> 14:42.533
I am here for you
no matter what.

14:42.577 --> 14:45.058
And don't answer any questions
or say anything at all

14:45.101 --> 14:46.407
until you talk to me again.

14:49.279 --> 14:50.585
- This just came in.
- Thank you.

14:52.543 --> 14:53.631
Plainview.

14:56.069 --> 14:57.418
Bail is set for Julie Anne Plainview.

15:02.423 --> 15:05.295
$750,000?

15:05.339 --> 15:07.210
I don't set the bail amount.

15:07.254 --> 15:10.083
There's some bondsman flyers
in the smoking area.

15:10.126 --> 15:12.955
I'm her mother.

15:12.999 --> 15:15.349
Can you release her
to me O.R.?

15:15.392 --> 15:17.742
She's just a child.

15:17.786 --> 15:20.093
She'll be 18 in three months.

15:20.136 --> 15:22.008
She's a flight risk anyways.

15:22.051 --> 15:23.835
What do you mean?

15:23.879 --> 15:25.837
We found out she booked
a trip to Paris.

15:25.881 --> 15:26.882
What?

15:26.926 --> 15:28.971
Airline confirmed.

15:29.015 --> 15:32.670
Yeah, you can petition for bail
relief at the arraignment.

15:32.714 --> 15:36.152
I'm really surprised to see
you here, Ms. Plainview.

15:36.196 --> 15:38.676
But I know how easy it is
to lose track of your children

15:38.720 --> 15:42.202
when you're so focused
on your career.

15:42.245 --> 15:43.943
Not me.

15:43.986 --> 15:46.336
I dote on my children

15:46.380 --> 15:47.947
because I see enough poor souls

15:47.990 --> 15:49.383
that end up messed up

15:49.426 --> 15:51.037
because mama
couldn't be bothered.

15:53.039 --> 15:54.214
You change your hair, Barbara?

15:56.868 --> 15:58.348
Looks good on you.

16:08.793 --> 16:10.273
Honey.

16:10.317 --> 16:13.450
Mom, you have to get me
out of here.

16:13.494 --> 16:14.495
I'm trying.

16:19.065 --> 16:21.415
They strip-searched me.

16:21.458 --> 16:24.374
I need you to stay strong
for me, Julie.

16:29.205 --> 16:32.252
When can we go home?

16:32.295 --> 16:35.429
They won't release you
without bail.

16:35.472 --> 16:37.083
They think you're a flight risk.

16:38.693 --> 16:42.001
Why do you have
a plane ticket to Paris?

16:42.044 --> 16:43.915
They were giving credit cards
out at the mall.

16:43.959 --> 16:45.221
So I got one for college.

16:47.354 --> 16:50.792
You always said we couldn't
afford to go to Paris.

16:50.835 --> 16:53.055
So I bought myself a gift.

16:53.099 --> 16:55.362
When were you going to
tell me about this?

16:58.669 --> 17:00.758
Can you bail me out or what?

17:02.238 --> 17:03.718
I'm... going to try.

17:05.633 --> 17:07.113
It's a lot of money.

17:09.810 --> 17:11.726
What are you saying?

17:13.380 --> 17:15.295
I have to spend the night here?

17:15.338 --> 17:17.862
I'm so sorry.

17:17.906 --> 17:20.909
All those years
of law school for what?

17:20.952 --> 17:23.433
You weren't there for me then.
You aren't here for me now.

17:23.477 --> 17:25.392
Honey, I am here for you.

17:25.435 --> 17:27.089
You probably think I'm guilty.

17:27.133 --> 17:27.959
Never.

17:40.885 --> 17:41.973
Julie!

Morning, Ms. Plainview.
Hope it's not too early.

- For what?
- You know the drill.

19:32.606 --> 19:33.694
Ma'am.

19:36.610 --> 19:38.089
What are you looking for?

19:38.133 --> 19:39.047
Where's your daughter's bedroom?

19:59.633 --> 20:00.938
Nice knives.

20:02.636 --> 20:03.724
I see you've got one missing.

20:19.566 --> 20:21.132
What are you looking for?

20:23.787 --> 20:25.746
Money. What do we
have here?

20:25.789 --> 20:28.270
Diaries are fun. Whoa.
Lot of writing.

Thank you very much.

20:42.545 --> 20:44.678

20:44.721 --> 20:45.505
Well...

20:47.724 --> 20:48.508
now we know.

20:52.425 --> 20:55.079
You can file a claim for that.

People versus
Julie Anne Plainview,

21:44.868 --> 21:47.262
murder in the first degree.

21:47.306 --> 21:49.308
Is counsel ready
to enter a plea?

21:50.918 --> 21:53.964
Yes, Your Honor.
We plead not guilty.

21:54.008 --> 21:57.533
Hmm, setting preliminary
for the 7th of September.

21:57.577 --> 21:59.753
Is that satisfactory?

21:59.796 --> 22:02.146
First, Your Honor,
on the matter of bail,

22:02.190 --> 22:04.235
we request that the defendant
be remanded

22:04.279 --> 22:05.933
to the custody of her mother.

22:05.976 --> 22:07.543
That's you, isn't it?

22:09.110 --> 22:10.938
Yes, Your Honor.

22:10.981 --> 22:13.375
Given the seriousness
of this charge

22:13.419 --> 22:15.682
and the circumstances
indicating that your daughter

22:15.725 --> 22:17.510
made plans to leave the country,

22:17.553 --> 22:20.208
I'm denying your request
at this time.

22:20.251 --> 22:21.775
Your Honor...

22:21.818 --> 22:23.342
I've spoken on the matter,
counselor.

22:25.779 --> 22:28.172
Then I'd like to affirm
our right to a speedy trial

22:28.216 --> 22:30.610
and move the preliminary hearing
up if possible.

22:30.653 --> 22:32.916
How do you like the 27th?

22:32.960 --> 22:35.092
That's two weeks from today.

22:35.136 --> 22:37.268
Fine.

22:37.312 --> 22:38.400
Thank you, Your Honor.

22:38.444 --> 22:39.619
Next case.

22:55.678 --> 22:56.549
Are you okay?

22:58.899 --> 23:01.423
How long am I
going to be here for?

23:01.467 --> 23:04.513
I'm doing everything I can,
sweetie, I promise.

23:08.343 --> 23:10.301
I have been through this
before, Julie.

23:12.042 --> 23:14.654
I need you to trust me, okay?

23:14.697 --> 23:19.049
But there's video showing you
and Sylvie leaving the house.

23:21.095 --> 23:22.096
Where did you go?

23:25.708 --> 23:28.102
We went to go get food

23:28.145 --> 23:31.018
at that taco stand
on 4th street.

23:31.061 --> 23:32.367
But they were closed.

23:34.804 --> 23:36.502
Why are you looking at me
like that?

23:39.766 --> 23:41.811
You think I did it, don't you?

23:41.855 --> 23:43.160
No.

23:43.204 --> 23:45.162
You know I didn't.

23:45.206 --> 23:46.599
I know that.

23:46.642 --> 23:48.165
But if there is anything
the police

23:48.209 --> 23:49.863
are going to find out
about that night,

23:49.906 --> 23:51.734
I have to know.

23:51.778 --> 23:53.388
Sweetie, I can't help you

23:53.432 --> 23:54.998
unless you're completely
honest with me.

24:06.009 --> 24:07.271
Time is up. Let's go.

24:07.315 --> 24:08.403
Julie...

24:11.841 --> 24:14.714
Sweetie, I'm going to get you
out of here, I promise!

24:14.757 --> 24:15.889
[Door closes]

24:47.486 --> 24:48.748
Ellen.

24:48.791 --> 24:51.098
Hi, Ben.

24:51.141 --> 24:54.188
Uh, come in.
Come on in, yeah.

25:08.332 --> 25:09.290
Here.

25:09.333 --> 25:11.466
Thanks.

25:11.510 --> 25:13.381
Looks like the writing
is going well.

25:13.424 --> 25:16.297
Yeah, "The Wrong Woman"
is still my biggest seller.

25:16.340 --> 25:18.038
You ever get around
to reading it?

25:18.081 --> 25:19.561
I lived it.

25:19.605 --> 25:21.258
Right.

25:21.302 --> 25:23.913
So, how do you like
being a lawyer?

25:23.957 --> 25:26.481
Well, so far I've only
handled minor cases.

25:26.525 --> 25:28.439
Petty theft, parole violations.

25:30.616 --> 25:33.270
But now, uh,
I have a murder case.

25:34.881 --> 25:36.447
Really?

25:36.491 --> 25:37.710
I'm not sure I'm up to it.

25:39.625 --> 25:41.061
You'll be fine.

25:41.104 --> 25:43.498
Why do you say that?

25:43.542 --> 25:45.108
It was just four years ago

25:45.152 --> 25:47.546
that you were wrongfully accused
of attempted murder.

25:47.589 --> 25:49.635
You could've gone to jail
for life.

25:49.678 --> 25:52.899
But you handled yourself
brilliantly in that courtroom,

25:52.942 --> 25:54.683
and you won.

25:54.727 --> 25:57.294
I'm not worried about you.

25:57.338 --> 26:00.863
This time, it's...
more serious.

26:00.907 --> 26:03.126
No chance.
Who's your client?

26:03.170 --> 26:04.214
Julie.

26:06.129 --> 26:08.175
Like your daughter Julie?
Little Julie?

26:14.398 --> 26:15.835
She's almost 18.

26:18.011 --> 26:20.317
One of her teachers
was stabbed to death.

26:20.361 --> 26:22.842
They found Julie's
fingerprints in the car,

26:22.885 --> 26:25.192
and the victim's wife
is claiming

26:25.235 --> 26:27.107
that Julie was stalking him.

26:27.150 --> 26:28.499
I don't believe that.

26:28.543 --> 26:30.806
Neither do I.

26:30.850 --> 26:34.505
Which is why I've come
to ask for your help.

26:34.549 --> 26:37.030
I mean, I think
I can handle the trial,

26:37.073 --> 26:38.945
but I would just feel
so much better

26:38.988 --> 26:40.816
with some support.

26:42.601 --> 26:46.126
During your last trial,
I was a mess.

26:46.169 --> 26:47.823
I was too close.
The stakes were too high.

26:47.867 --> 26:48.650
I...

26:51.610 --> 26:53.002
I can't do that to myself again.

26:56.789 --> 27:00.140
Besides, I'm way past
my deadline for my new book.

27:00.183 --> 27:02.533
My editor is breathing
down my neck.

27:02.577 --> 27:06.233
I hope this isn't because
of what happened between us.

27:07.887 --> 27:09.192
No.

27:09.236 --> 27:10.324
[Chuckles]
No, of course not.

27:12.239 --> 27:15.590
I would say yes if I wasn't
absolutely certain

27:15.634 --> 27:17.505
that you're capable
of doing this.

27:17.548 --> 27:19.725
You're a good lawyer.

27:19.768 --> 27:21.291
I'm sorry I bothered you.

27:21.335 --> 27:25.426
Hey, look, Ellen...

27:25.469 --> 27:27.558
if you really get into
a tight spot...

27:29.909 --> 27:30.910
Good luck with your book.

28:11.777 --> 28:12.778
Who is that?

28:12.821 --> 28:15.128
Ellen Plainview?

28:15.171 --> 28:16.738
Kimberly Baines.

28:16.782 --> 28:18.740
I've seen you around
the courthouse,

28:18.784 --> 28:21.177
but I always assumed
you were a clerk or something.

28:21.221 --> 28:24.528
I don't know why.
Is this the defendant?

28:24.572 --> 28:26.748
Yes.

28:26.792 --> 28:28.837
My daughter, Julie.

28:28.881 --> 28:31.753
Defending your own daughter.
Bold move.

28:38.586 --> 28:40.370
Bailiff:
All rise.

28:49.728 --> 28:50.772
Please be seated.

28:54.558 --> 28:58.258
In the matter of People
versus Julie Anne Plainview,

28:58.301 --> 29:00.739
the court finds
sufficient evidence

29:00.782 --> 29:03.742
to hold the defendant
to answer for the violation

29:03.785 --> 29:07.658
of Penal Code 187,
murder in the first degree...

29:09.225 --> 29:12.402
and order that
Julie Anne Plainview

29:12.446 --> 29:17.973
be bound over for trial
in Department 24.

29:18.017 --> 29:20.976
Does August 4th work
for everybody?

29:21.020 --> 29:22.499
Fine by me.

29:22.543 --> 29:25.372
Yes, Your Honor.

29:25.415 --> 29:27.853
Your Honor,
I'd like to request that Julie

29:27.896 --> 29:30.681
be remanded to my custody
until trial.

29:30.725 --> 29:32.988
We've surrendered her passport,
she's a minor,

29:33.032 --> 29:34.990
and she poses no flight risk.

29:35.034 --> 29:37.688
And I don't believe
that she can reasonably

29:37.732 --> 29:40.735
be regarded as a danger
to the community.

29:40.779 --> 29:44.260
I'm willing to grant that.
Ms. Baines?

29:44.304 --> 29:46.219
With the condition that she
wear an ankle monitor.

29:48.699 --> 29:50.527
I don't think that's necessary.

29:50.571 --> 29:51.572
Thank you, Your Honor.

29:54.880 --> 29:55.706
We're going home.

29:58.927 --> 30:00.799
Do you have any idea
why there was a knife

30:00.842 --> 30:01.843
missing from our set?

30:03.976 --> 30:06.369
No.

30:06.413 --> 30:08.850
These questions are going
to keep getting harder, Julie.

30:08.894 --> 30:10.591
Gene Dutton's wife
told the police

30:10.634 --> 30:13.072
that you were obsessed
with them.

30:13.115 --> 30:14.987
That's ridiculous.

30:15.030 --> 30:17.032
Do you have any idea why she
would say something like that?

30:17.076 --> 30:18.686
Yeah.

30:18.729 --> 30:20.993
'Cause she's crazy.

30:21.036 --> 30:23.560
Mom, she would come to school
and spy on her husband

30:23.604 --> 30:25.388
because she thought
all the girls were after him.

30:25.432 --> 30:27.303
She was just jealous.

30:27.347 --> 30:30.393
Okay, but she mentioned you
specifically. Why?

30:30.437 --> 30:32.091
Why don't you ask her?

30:38.184 --> 30:39.968
Mrs. Dutton?

30:40.012 --> 30:42.144
Good afternoon.
I'm Ellen Plainview.

30:42.188 --> 30:44.320
I know who you are.
What are you doing here?

30:46.757 --> 30:49.412
First of all, I want to say
how sorry I am for your loss.

30:52.154 --> 30:55.679
As you know, the police
think that my daughter

30:55.723 --> 30:57.725
might have been responsible
for your husband's death.

30:57.768 --> 30:59.553
His murder.

30:59.596 --> 31:02.034
And I'm just trying
to put together the facts.

31:03.949 --> 31:05.733
Apparently, you told the police

31:05.776 --> 31:08.388
that my daughter had been
stalking your husband?

31:08.431 --> 31:09.476
That's right.

31:10.999 --> 31:12.696
But I talked to Julie,

31:12.740 --> 31:15.699
and she said
it's absolutely untrue.

31:15.743 --> 31:18.093
Her fingerprints
were in his car.

31:18.137 --> 31:20.356
Okay, but... stalking?

31:22.358 --> 31:24.186
I know what I saw.

31:25.492 --> 31:27.929
Notes in his pockets,

31:27.973 --> 31:30.323
hearts drawn
in the dust of his car,

31:30.366 --> 31:32.760
flowers on his desk at school?

31:32.803 --> 31:34.240
The phone rang late at night,

31:34.283 --> 31:36.677
and if I answered,
the caller hung up.

31:36.720 --> 31:38.809
It upset my husband.

31:38.853 --> 31:41.638
He wanted nothing
to do with your daughter.

31:41.682 --> 31:43.858
But how do you know
it was Julie?

31:43.902 --> 31:46.252
Are you blind?

31:46.295 --> 31:49.168
Do you know anything
about your daughter?

31:49.211 --> 31:50.952
Of course it was her!

31:50.996 --> 31:52.823
The little tramp
would come to my house

31:52.867 --> 31:54.869
when she thought I wasn't home!

31:57.480 --> 32:01.702
Oh, you didn't know
about that, did you?

32:01.745 --> 32:05.401
She showed up one night when
I was supposed to be at work.

32:05.445 --> 32:07.838
The look on her face
when I opened the door.

32:10.015 --> 32:12.408
I know guilt when I see it.

32:13.757 --> 32:16.847
Wait, is that it?

32:16.891 --> 32:19.633
Mrs. Dutton, again,
I'm very sorry for your loss,

32:19.676 --> 32:21.243
but if the statements
that you've given

32:21.287 --> 32:23.376
to the police are based
solely on assumptions...

32:23.419 --> 32:26.248
I am done talking to you.
I am working.

32:26.292 --> 32:28.903
If you come here again,
I will call the police.

32:32.385 --> 32:34.213
I hope your daughter
burns in hell.

33:10.989 --> 33:13.034
Oh, hi, Ms. Plainview.
What's up?

33:13.078 --> 33:14.905
Hi, Sylvie.

33:14.949 --> 33:17.865
I need to talk to you about
the charges against Julie.

33:17.908 --> 33:20.041
Oh, my God, it's horrible.
How is she?

33:20.085 --> 33:23.175
She's okay for now.

33:23.218 --> 33:25.438
We're preparing for trial,
and I just need to know

33:25.481 --> 33:28.180
from your point of view
exactly what happened

33:28.223 --> 33:30.095
the night Mr. Dutton died.

33:30.138 --> 33:32.053
You were with Julie at the time.

33:32.097 --> 33:34.012
Yeah, we hung out here
all night.

33:35.709 --> 33:37.189
All night?

33:37.232 --> 33:38.886
She said you two went out.

33:38.929 --> 33:41.628
Oh, she told you.

33:41.671 --> 33:43.630
What did she say?

33:43.673 --> 33:45.806
She told me the truth, Sylvie,

33:45.849 --> 33:47.938
and I hope you'll do the same.

33:47.982 --> 33:49.636
She told you about the guys?

33:52.682 --> 33:55.816
Uh, yeah, I just would like
to hear it, um, from you.

33:55.859 --> 33:58.688
They were a couple
of tourist guys from France.

33:58.732 --> 34:01.735
We went down to our
hangout, tower 6.

34:01.778 --> 34:06.131
And what did you
and these boys do all night?

34:06.174 --> 34:07.784
Just hung out.

34:07.828 --> 34:10.178
They brought snacks
and we just talked.

34:10.222 --> 34:12.789
Nobody had sex, if that's
what you're worried about.

34:12.833 --> 34:15.400
And you were there all night?

34:15.444 --> 34:16.967
Pretty much.

34:17.011 --> 34:18.491
Did you get their names?

34:18.534 --> 34:21.014
Robert and Pascal?

34:21.059 --> 34:23.539
They didn't say
their last names.

34:23.583 --> 34:25.759
Did you exchange phone numbers
or anything?

34:25.802 --> 34:27.848
No, they were leaving
the next day.

34:27.891 --> 34:30.677
So, there's no way
to contact them.

34:30.719 --> 34:32.157
Sorry.

34:32.199 --> 34:34.681
I know you and Julie
are very close.

34:34.724 --> 34:36.596
You're the only friend
she ever talks about.

34:36.639 --> 34:38.032
Really?

34:38.076 --> 34:41.643
Do you know if she had
any kind of...

34:41.688 --> 34:44.473
relationship
with Mr. Dutton?

34:44.516 --> 34:46.822
I know Julie liked
Mr. Dutton,

34:46.867 --> 34:49.956
but Julie wasn't
really his type.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.610
What do you mean?

34:51.654 --> 34:55.179
The rumor was that
he liked wild girls.

34:55.223 --> 34:57.094
- What's going on out here?
- You know what I mean?

34:57.138 --> 34:59.967
You don't come to my house
and harass my daughter.

35:00.010 --> 35:01.751
I don't want her caught up
in your trouble.

35:01.795 --> 35:04.841
She's a material witness
in Julie's case, Mrs. Garrett.

35:04.885 --> 35:07.148
Just because you failed
as a mother

35:07.192 --> 35:09.150
doesn't give you the right
to interfere with my family.

35:09.194 --> 35:11.892
Sylvie, inside right now.
Go. Go.

35:15.983 --> 35:17.854
Get off my property.

35:21.162 --> 35:24.078
I told you she's crazy.

35:24.122 --> 35:26.994
Mom, you know Mr. Dutton
was my tennis coach.

35:27.037 --> 35:29.257
He gave me a ride home
from practice a few times.

35:29.301 --> 35:31.172
That doesn't mean
I was sleeping with him.

35:31.216 --> 35:33.479
Did you go to his house?

35:33.522 --> 35:36.134
Yeah, once.

35:36.177 --> 35:39.180
I left my racket in his car,
and I stopped by to pick it up.

35:39.224 --> 35:41.313
Why didn't you tell me this
in the first place?

35:41.356 --> 35:43.184
So you could freak out?

35:43.228 --> 35:45.360
You hate it when I talk
to any guy

35:45.404 --> 35:48.058
that's even half
a month older than me.

35:48.102 --> 35:51.627
I want to know
about these French boys.

35:51.671 --> 35:54.587
We met them at the coffee shop.

35:54.630 --> 35:57.329
We saw them later at the beach.

35:57.372 --> 35:59.896
They were totally cool.
Nothing happened.

35:59.940 --> 36:02.072
We just hung out.

36:02.116 --> 36:03.639
How long were you there?

36:03.683 --> 36:05.163
I don't know exactly.
I fell asleep.

36:07.382 --> 36:08.949
Fell asleep.

36:10.951 --> 36:13.475
Did you smoke pot
with these boys?

36:19.307 --> 36:20.961
Julie...

36:21.004 --> 36:22.223
Have I taught you nothing?

36:24.573 --> 36:25.705
[Knock on door]

36:57.911 --> 36:59.608
Julie, we need to talk.

36:59.652 --> 37:00.827
Sit down.

37:00.870 --> 37:02.045
After I eat.

37:02.089 --> 37:04.265
We need to talk now.

37:04.309 --> 37:05.266
Sit down.

37:09.052 --> 37:11.141
They have records
of text messages

37:11.185 --> 37:13.709
from your phone
to Mr. Dutton.

37:13.753 --> 37:16.582
Yeah, and they're about
homework and tennis practice.

37:16.625 --> 37:19.193
So?

37:19.237 --> 37:23.719
"If you ignore me, Gene,
there will be consequences."

37:23.763 --> 37:25.591
What does that mean?

37:25.634 --> 37:27.375
- I didn't send that.
- Julie, please.

37:27.419 --> 37:29.247
Mom, someone must've
jacked my phone at school

37:29.290 --> 37:31.423
and sent it as a joke
because I didn't send that.

37:31.466 --> 37:32.467
Bring me your phone.

37:32.511 --> 37:33.294
I lost it.

37:35.078 --> 37:36.297
I swear, it's the truth.

37:42.608 --> 37:44.305
Is that my journal?

37:44.349 --> 37:46.829
They found it in your room.

37:46.873 --> 37:48.440
There's nothing juicy in there

37:48.483 --> 37:49.441
if that's
what you're looking for.

37:52.531 --> 37:53.445
What?

37:55.011 --> 37:56.186
Mom, what?

38:06.196 --> 38:08.329
I didn't write this.

38:08.373 --> 38:10.984
It's in your journal.
If you didn't write it, who did?

38:11.027 --> 38:12.812
I don't know!
Maybe the cops!

38:12.855 --> 38:15.858
Do you know how all this
is going to look to a jury?

38:15.902 --> 38:18.252
You're supposed to believe me!
You're my mother!

38:18.296 --> 38:20.559
- Why don't you act like it?
- Julie...

38:20.602 --> 38:22.343
You never cared
about anything that I did

38:22.387 --> 38:24.040
as long as I got good grades

38:24.084 --> 38:25.781
and I acted like
the perfect daughter.

38:25.825 --> 38:27.740
I know you resent me
because I came along

38:27.783 --> 38:29.959
- when you were only 18.
- That is not true.

38:30.003 --> 38:32.048
And now you wanna know
everything about my life?

38:32.092 --> 38:35.051
We are talking
about murder, Julie.

38:35.095 --> 38:36.444
Do you understand?

38:36.488 --> 38:38.707
You have to work with me on this

38:38.751 --> 38:41.275
or you could go to prison
for the rest of your life.

38:45.323 --> 38:49.544
All I want is the truth.

38:49.588 --> 38:50.937
In the end,

38:50.980 --> 38:54.157
it is the only thing
that matters.

38:54.201 --> 38:56.899
You can't run from it, sweetie.

38:56.943 --> 38:59.728
So please, if there
is anything you can tell me.

39:03.210 --> 39:05.212
You know what?

39:05.255 --> 39:08.258
When I'm ready to confess,
you'll be the first to know.

39:28.496 --> 39:30.411
[Doorbell rings]

39:33.371 --> 39:34.546
Hi, Julie.

39:34.589 --> 39:36.939
Hey, Steve.

39:36.983 --> 39:40.378
Thought you could use something
to brighten your day.

39:45.774 --> 39:47.994
So, uh...

39:48.037 --> 39:49.082
how are you?

39:51.606 --> 39:52.868
How do you think?

39:52.912 --> 39:54.957
I know, the world's gone crazy.

39:55.001 --> 39:57.351
How could anyone think
you would hurt somebody?

39:57.395 --> 39:59.527
Hello, Steve.

39:59.571 --> 40:01.660
Flowers, how nice.

40:03.923 --> 40:05.751
We'll get these in a vase.

40:05.794 --> 40:07.796
I saw The Checks
in San Diego last week.

40:10.320 --> 40:12.061
Brought you a memento.

40:12.105 --> 40:14.629
And if you guys need a
character witness at the trial,

40:14.673 --> 40:16.239
I'm your man.

40:16.283 --> 40:18.285
We just might take you up
on that, Steve.

40:28.034 --> 40:31.385
Don't worry, you're...
you're not going to prison.

40:31.429 --> 40:34.083
There's no way
they're going to convict you.

40:34.127 --> 40:36.346
How do you know that?

40:36.390 --> 40:38.479
Because I know you didn't do it.

41:42.587 --> 41:44.719
Oh. Hello.

41:44.763 --> 41:46.591
I'm sorry to intrude.

41:46.634 --> 41:48.331
No, no, you're not
intruding. What's up?

41:50.072 --> 41:52.640
Is Ben home?

41:52.684 --> 41:54.816
You know, I think
he's in the shower.

41:54.860 --> 41:57.036
If I could just leave
these here with him.

41:57.079 --> 42:00.082
It's copies of my case files,
and if he could just

42:00.126 --> 42:01.954
look at them and tell me
if I missed anything.

42:01.997 --> 42:04.434
Yeah, no, I'll let him know.

42:04.478 --> 42:08.134
The documents are important
and confidential,

42:08.177 --> 42:11.659
so just make sure
that Ben gets them.

42:11.703 --> 42:13.879
And if he's, you know,
too busy tonight,

42:13.922 --> 42:17.970
I totally understand,
but if he wants to call me,

42:18.013 --> 42:22.061
I'll be up...
late... working.

42:22.104 --> 42:23.410
I'll let him know.

42:23.453 --> 42:24.237
Okay, thank you.

42:24.280 --> 42:26.326
Mm-hmm.

42:26.369 --> 42:28.633
And, uh, with my compliments.

42:28.676 --> 42:31.244
Cool. Thank you.

42:31.287 --> 42:32.201
Yeah, sure.

42:39.644 --> 42:40.949
[Sighs]

42:59.098 --> 43:01.274
We're going to lose, aren't we?

43:02.928 --> 43:03.798
Honey...

43:06.627 --> 43:09.499
I can't go to prison, Mom.

43:09.543 --> 43:10.457
I can't.

43:11.980 --> 43:14.069
If we can just get the jury

43:14.113 --> 43:16.985
to see the truth, sweetie,
you're going to be fine.

43:17.029 --> 43:18.900
- Jules, come here.
- Leave me alone.

43:20.902 --> 43:22.338
It's what you're good at.

43:47.363 --> 43:49.844
Julie?
We have to leave by 8:00.

43:51.716 --> 43:52.542
You awake?

43:57.722 --> 43:58.984
Julie?

44:03.249 --> 44:04.467
Julie?

44:19.613 --> 44:21.354
Julie! What...

44:21.397 --> 44:23.182
[crying]

44:23.225 --> 44:25.575
I'm so sorry, Mom.

44:25.619 --> 44:27.665
[Sobbing]

44:27.708 --> 44:31.669
I'm so sorry.
I was just so scared.

44:31.712 --> 44:34.149
I'm so scared.

44:34.193 --> 44:35.629
She called me.

44:35.673 --> 44:37.022
I should've talked her
out of it.

44:37.065 --> 44:38.240
I'm so sorry.

44:40.155 --> 44:43.681
I asked Steve
to take me away somewhere.

44:43.724 --> 44:47.206
I couldn't stand
the idea of going to court

44:47.249 --> 44:51.863
and having everyone look at me
like I was a murderer.

44:51.906 --> 44:54.561
But I didn't know what to do.

44:56.215 --> 44:58.130
You're all I have, Mommy.

45:01.524 --> 45:03.135
Sweetie.

45:03.178 --> 45:05.703
We have each other, Jules.

45:05.746 --> 45:07.139
We'll always have each other.

45:23.590 --> 45:26.941
Ellen Plainview.
Wow, long time no see.

45:26.985 --> 45:28.203
How are you?

45:28.247 --> 45:29.770
We're on our way to court.

45:29.814 --> 45:32.033
No, I heard you're
practicing law now.

45:32.077 --> 45:33.948
I heard you have
an interesting client, too.

45:33.992 --> 45:36.516
Hmm. Wow.

45:36.559 --> 45:38.779
You Plainview girls just can't seem
to stay out of trouble, though.

45:38.823 --> 45:41.782
What is that?
It probably runs in the family.

45:41.826 --> 45:44.089
I'm Ed Flynn,
I defended your mother

45:44.132 --> 45:45.917
when she was charged with
attempted murder.

45:45.960 --> 45:48.397
We won, too, mm-hmm.

45:48.441 --> 45:50.138
Didn't my mom have to fire you

45:50.182 --> 45:52.880
and take over the case herself?

45:52.924 --> 45:56.797
So, I hear that you are going
up against Kimberly Baines.

45:56.841 --> 45:59.060
[Shiver]
I don't envy you that.

45:59.104 --> 46:02.020
No, that woman, well, she
is a panther in suede pumps,

46:02.063 --> 46:04.152
she really is,
and I have also heard

46:04.196 --> 46:05.719
that she is especially vicious

46:05.763 --> 46:07.590
when she goes up against
another woman.

46:07.634 --> 46:09.331
I don't know why.

46:09.375 --> 46:11.812
Yeah, I tell you,
I would really think about

46:11.856 --> 46:14.684
taking a plea if you can,
if you want my advice.

46:14.728 --> 46:16.295
Get out of our way.

46:24.607 --> 46:26.348
Ben.

46:26.392 --> 46:27.741
Hey.

46:27.785 --> 46:29.787
My sister
gave me your case files.

46:29.830 --> 46:31.397
I've been up half the night
reviewing them.

46:31.440 --> 46:33.312
Your sister?

46:33.355 --> 46:34.661
Yeah, she's in town
for a seminar.

46:34.704 --> 46:36.184
I've done some
background work for you,

46:36.228 --> 46:37.533
made some witness notes.

46:37.577 --> 46:39.144
I'm here to help if I can.

46:39.187 --> 46:41.146
But your book.

46:41.189 --> 46:42.800
It's going to have to wait.

46:42.843 --> 46:44.149
I should've offered to help
from the beginning.

46:44.192 --> 46:45.846
I'm sorry.

46:45.890 --> 46:47.848
When I saw Julie's mug shot
in the case files,

46:47.892 --> 46:50.111
it absolutely...
it broke my heart.

46:50.155 --> 46:51.765
And the fact that
she would have to

46:51.809 --> 46:55.160
go through something
like this and you...

46:55.203 --> 46:58.424
Julie, hey, hi, I'm Ben.
Do you remember me?

46:58.467 --> 47:00.905
Of course I do.

47:00.948 --> 47:03.211
We're going to
get through this, okay?

47:03.255 --> 47:06.606
Luckily, you have an amazing
lawyer working for you.

47:06.649 --> 47:09.870
Ladies and gentlemen,
I feel very fortunate

47:09.914 --> 47:11.829
to be able to prosecute
this case

47:11.872 --> 47:15.397
before such an intelligent
assembly of jurors.

47:15.441 --> 47:18.052
After examining the evidence and listening to the witnesses,

47:18.096 --> 47:22.535
I have no doubt that each
and every one of you

47:22.578 --> 47:24.493
is smart enough to come
to the right conclusion

47:24.537 --> 47:26.800
in this case.

47:26.844 --> 47:28.976
You and I weren't able
to be there for Julie Plainview

47:29.020 --> 47:32.675
when she was in need
of strong moral guidance.

47:32.719 --> 47:34.982
Sadly, neither was her mother.

47:38.551 --> 47:41.815
And it will be an act of mercy
to help Julie Plainview

47:41.859 --> 47:44.165
understand what she did.

47:44.209 --> 47:46.864
And when you have learned
the whole truth,

47:46.907 --> 47:49.910
it will be an act of mercy
to put her

47:49.954 --> 47:53.305
where she can no longer
be a danger to herself

47:53.348 --> 47:55.046
or others again.

47:57.613 --> 47:58.440
Thank you.

48:03.054 --> 48:04.620
Judge:
Ms. Plainview?

48:13.020 --> 48:14.935
Ladies and gentlemen,

48:14.979 --> 48:19.200
as you look at the evidence
and listen to the witnesses,

48:19.244 --> 48:21.855
it's important to keep in mind

48:21.899 --> 48:25.946
that things are not always
as they seem.

48:25.990 --> 48:29.297
The police formed their theory
about who killed Mr. Dutton

48:29.341 --> 48:33.432
within hours of the crime.

48:33.475 --> 48:36.174
Everything they have done
since then has been an attempt

48:36.217 --> 48:38.785
to support
their initial assumption.

48:41.005 --> 48:44.573
But I ask you
to examine this case

48:44.617 --> 48:47.228
with an open mind.

48:47.272 --> 48:50.666
Think critically,
and draw your own conclusions.

48:52.799 --> 48:56.498
Because this isn't just about
which side wins.

48:56.542 --> 48:59.371
It's about the life and future

48:59.414 --> 49:01.590
of this promising young woman

49:01.634 --> 49:04.724
who as you will see
has found herself the victim

49:04.767 --> 49:07.074
of a reckless
and potentially devastating

49:07.118 --> 49:08.467
rush to judgment.

49:11.035 --> 49:11.731
Thank you.

49:18.956 --> 49:21.219
Your first witness.

49:21.262 --> 49:24.265
Detective Ogawa,
what led you and your partner,

49:24.309 --> 49:26.180
Detective Hamer,
to focus your investigation

49:26.224 --> 49:28.661
- on Julie Plainview?
- Just about everything.

49:28.704 --> 49:31.359
The victim's spouse
reported that her husband

49:31.403 --> 49:35.233
had been the target of unwelcome
attention from Ms. Plainview.

49:35.276 --> 49:38.018
Luckily, her mother
had her fingerprinted

49:38.062 --> 49:41.021
as part of a school
safety program,

49:41.065 --> 49:44.503
and we found the defendant's
prints inside the victim's car.

49:44.546 --> 49:47.114
An eyewitness positively
ID'd Miss Plainview

49:47.158 --> 49:48.768
as being at the crime scene,

49:48.811 --> 49:51.205
and the texts
and journal entries

49:51.249 --> 49:52.902
erased any remaining doubt.

49:52.946 --> 49:54.643
An open and shut case.

49:54.687 --> 49:55.514
Pretty much.

50:03.130 --> 50:05.350
Detective Ogawa,
will you please explain

50:05.393 --> 50:08.266
how it's possible
to determine with certainty

50:08.309 --> 50:11.704
who actually sent a text
from a given cell phone?

50:11.747 --> 50:14.968
Well, it's not possible,
but one can assume that...

50:15.012 --> 50:16.970
Assume?

50:17.014 --> 50:18.015
Assume.

50:20.060 --> 50:23.977
Is it in your job description
to assume things, Detective?

50:24.021 --> 50:26.936
Particularly when it could send
a young girl to prison

50:26.980 --> 50:28.634
for the rest of her life?

50:31.506 --> 50:33.639
Moving on to the fingerprints.

50:35.423 --> 50:37.686
Do those prints
found in Mr. Dutton's car

50:37.730 --> 50:40.559
offer positive proof
that Julie Plainview

50:40.602 --> 50:42.778
was in that car on the night
of the murder,

50:42.822 --> 50:45.303
on that night specifically?

50:45.346 --> 50:49.263
Proof positive?
I-I mean...

50:49.307 --> 50:52.266
Isn't it possible that those
prints were left in that car

50:52.310 --> 50:54.703
on another occasion,
perhaps when Mr. Dutton

50:54.747 --> 50:56.792
gave a favorite student
a ride home

50:56.836 --> 51:00.840
from tennis practice
days or even weeks prior?

51:00.883 --> 51:03.103
Possible but not...

51:03.147 --> 51:05.627
Possible?
Yes or no?

51:07.542 --> 51:08.587
Yes.

51:12.808 --> 51:14.636
No further questions.

51:14.680 --> 51:17.117
Detective, you submitted
the journal

51:17.161 --> 51:19.032
recovered from
my daughter's bedroom

51:19.076 --> 51:20.990
to the department's
handwriting expert, correct?

51:21.034 --> 51:23.210
As a matter of routine, yes.

51:23.254 --> 51:27.214
But that expert doesn't appear

51:27.258 --> 51:30.130
on the prosecution's
witness list.

51:30.174 --> 51:33.655
We didn't feel his testimony was necessary.

51:33.699 --> 51:36.919
In fact, the results
were inconclusive,

51:36.963 --> 51:39.879
according to your report
to the district attorney.

51:39.922 --> 51:42.969
And since the entry consists
of simple block letters,

51:43.012 --> 51:45.276
there's no way to determine
definitively

51:45.319 --> 51:47.191
who wrote the entry, correct?

51:47.234 --> 51:49.323
We found it in your
daughter's journal.

51:49.367 --> 51:52.065
Are we back to assuming,
Detective?

51:54.676 --> 51:57.766
You and Detective Ogawa
arrested Julie Plainview

51:57.810 --> 52:01.118
less than 32 hours
after the murder.

52:01.161 --> 52:04.556
Did you bother to question
any other suspects?

52:04.599 --> 52:07.036
There was no need.

52:07.080 --> 52:09.126
Did you look into
the victim's background

52:09.169 --> 52:11.389
to check for other possible
perpetrators,

52:11.432 --> 52:13.042
check the area
for similar crimes?

52:13.086 --> 52:14.783
What are you implying?

52:14.827 --> 52:16.568
I'm simply asking if you
performed due diligence

52:16.611 --> 52:18.004
in this case or...

52:18.047 --> 52:20.485
I have been on the force
for 14 years,

52:20.528 --> 52:22.269
and my record is impeccable.

52:22.313 --> 52:24.228
I am not going to sit here
and have my integrity

52:24.271 --> 52:25.664
impugned by you.

52:25.707 --> 52:27.492
No, not again.

52:27.535 --> 52:29.581
It's true, Detective Hamer,
I have questioned you

52:29.624 --> 52:31.322
on this stand before,
and at that time,

52:31.365 --> 52:33.062
if you will recall,

52:33.106 --> 52:36.196
you suspected me
of attempted murder.

52:36.240 --> 52:38.720
Do you remember the verdict
in that case?

52:38.764 --> 52:40.505
You know damn well what it was!

52:40.548 --> 52:41.941
Objection.

52:41.984 --> 52:43.595
To what, Ms. Baines?

52:46.859 --> 52:49.992
Never mind, Your Honor.
I think we're done.

52:57.783 --> 52:59.654
Julie?

52:59.698 --> 53:01.221
Where are you going?

53:01.265 --> 53:02.831
I was going to practice yoga.

53:02.875 --> 53:03.702
In the garage?

53:05.486 --> 53:07.532
Without your mat.

53:07.575 --> 53:10.230
I was going to see
if it was warm enough first.

53:10.274 --> 53:12.014
Why don't you just use
the guest room?

53:12.058 --> 53:12.798
Fine.

53:17.455 --> 53:20.893
Mrs. Dutton, besides
the late-night phone calls,

53:20.936 --> 53:24.113
the texts, and the surprise
visits to your house,

53:24.157 --> 53:27.291
what else caused you
to suspect that Julie Plainview

53:27.334 --> 53:29.989
was responsible
for your husband's murder?

53:30.032 --> 53:33.558
Just what Gene told me himself.

53:33.601 --> 53:35.516
I went by the school one day,

53:35.560 --> 53:38.389
and I saw them alone together
in his classroom.

53:38.432 --> 53:40.521
When I asked him about it later,

53:40.565 --> 53:43.220
he said Julie had been paying
too much attention to him,

53:43.263 --> 53:45.787
and he was just trying
to get her to stop.

53:45.831 --> 53:48.225
Because he was afraid she
might do something drastic.

53:48.268 --> 53:50.227
Yes.

53:50.270 --> 53:52.490
Because he was afraid
she might do something drastic.

53:52.533 --> 53:54.796
Objection.
Hearsay.

53:54.840 --> 53:56.015
Sustained.

53:57.930 --> 53:59.671
Mrs. Dutton...

53:59.714 --> 54:03.370
would you say that your husband
was in fear of his life

54:03.414 --> 54:06.199
because of Julie Plainview's
dangerous obsession with him?

54:06.243 --> 54:07.896
Yes.

54:07.940 --> 54:10.072
He was in fear of his life

54:10.116 --> 54:12.901
due to her dangerous obsession.

54:12.945 --> 54:14.642
Thank you.

54:14.686 --> 54:16.296
No further questions,
Your Honor.

54:26.132 --> 54:28.656
Mrs. Dutton,
you testified

54:28.700 --> 54:31.833
that you and your husband
had a loving relationship.

54:31.877 --> 54:33.922
We were very close.

54:33.966 --> 54:36.098
But when you first talked
to the police,

54:36.142 --> 54:39.188
you mentioned that you'd
separated twice

54:39.232 --> 54:41.408
in the last 18 months.

54:41.452 --> 54:44.716
We had our rough spots,
like any marriage.

54:44.759 --> 54:46.239
Like yours.

54:48.285 --> 54:51.766
Are you referring to infidelity?

54:51.810 --> 54:54.029
That's a good point.

54:54.073 --> 54:59.078
Not all husbands are faithful.
Are they, Mrs. Dutton?

54:59.121 --> 55:01.776
Is it possible that when you
found your husband

55:01.820 --> 55:04.779
alone with a female student,
that he made up that story

55:04.823 --> 55:07.042
about her obsession
in order to hide

55:07.086 --> 55:09.567
his own complicity
in the relationship?

55:09.610 --> 55:11.220
Gene would never
have anything to do

55:11.264 --> 55:13.875
with a girl like your daughter.

55:13.919 --> 55:17.618
And yet he had been reported
for inappropriate behavior

55:17.662 --> 55:20.099
with a female student
in his previous post

55:20.142 --> 55:22.536
in Tacoma, Washington,
isn't that correct?

55:22.580 --> 55:25.234
That was a misunderstanding.

55:25.278 --> 55:27.585
Isn't it true that you were
jealous of the relationship

55:27.628 --> 55:30.196
that you thought your husband was
having with Julie Plainview,

55:30.239 --> 55:31.806
and that's why you gave
her name to the police

55:31.850 --> 55:33.678
when they were looking
for someone to charge

55:33.721 --> 55:36.071
- with your husband's murder.
- This is absurd.

55:36.115 --> 55:39.597
I gave her name to the police
because she killed my husband!

55:39.640 --> 55:41.860
This trial isn't about me!

55:41.903 --> 55:44.732
You're right, Mrs. Dutton.
This trial is not about you.

55:44.776 --> 55:47.866
It's about finding the truth.

55:47.909 --> 55:50.347
No further questions.

55:50.390 --> 55:53.872
Your Honor,
the People call Otis Pell.

55:53.915 --> 55:56.396
You've testified that you
were out walking along

55:56.440 --> 55:59.181
the northeast edge of the
Palisades Beach parking lot

55:59.225 --> 56:01.401
around midnight
on the night of June 9th.

56:01.445 --> 56:03.055
I was.

56:03.098 --> 56:05.710
And what did you observe
on your walk that night?

56:05.753 --> 56:08.321
I was looking across
the parking lot,

56:08.365 --> 56:11.672
watching the seagulls,
when I see two people

56:11.716 --> 56:15.067
sitting in a car
doing Lord knows what.

56:15.110 --> 56:16.634
And the door opens.

56:16.677 --> 56:20.115
Driver comes out
and falls down dead.

56:20.159 --> 56:22.944
Then the other person
jumps out and runs away.

56:22.988 --> 56:24.990
Would you be able to identify
this person

56:25.033 --> 56:26.339
if you were to see them again?

56:26.383 --> 56:27.645
Sure.

56:27.688 --> 56:29.516
I told the police.

56:29.560 --> 56:31.692
They showed me pictures
of some people,

56:31.736 --> 56:33.607
and I picked her out.

56:33.651 --> 56:35.696
And is the person you
pointed out to the police

56:35.740 --> 56:37.698
here in this courtroom today?

56:37.742 --> 56:40.397
You know she is!

56:40.440 --> 56:41.746
That's the killer right there!

56:51.146 --> 56:52.931
Ben:
So, let's win this case.

56:52.974 --> 56:56.064
Tell me about Otis Pell,
the eyewitness.

56:56.108 --> 56:59.111
Ran a dairy store for 30 years
with his wife until she died.

56:59.154 --> 57:01.069
And now he watches a lot of TV.

57:01.113 --> 57:03.115
And seagulls.

57:03.158 --> 57:05.509
You went down to the scene
of the crime?

57:05.552 --> 57:06.988
Yeah.

57:07.032 --> 57:08.425
I went the afternoon
of the prelim.

57:10.601 --> 57:11.819
But you haven't gone at night?

57:27.966 --> 57:29.533
The eyewitness
was walking along there.

57:31.056 --> 57:32.057
Did you bring your camera?

57:37.715 --> 57:39.543
Okay, great,
let's prove him wrong.

57:45.026 --> 57:46.419
Ellen:
The day Julie was born

57:46.463 --> 57:47.681
was the happiest day of my life.

57:49.596 --> 57:52.686
And the scariest.

57:52.730 --> 57:54.340
You wonder how you're ever
going to provide

57:54.383 --> 57:56.516
for what your child needs

57:56.560 --> 57:59.476
or protect her from...
the world.

58:01.521 --> 58:03.567
It's so hard to know what to do,

58:03.610 --> 58:07.222
and you try to think
of everything.

58:07.266 --> 58:09.137
But you can't.

58:09.181 --> 58:13.098
I went to law school
so I could do good things

58:13.141 --> 58:14.969
in the world
and earn enough money

58:15.013 --> 58:16.231
to send Julie to college.

58:18.451 --> 58:20.322
I didn't realize how much

58:20.366 --> 58:22.586
it was going to take me
away from her.

58:22.629 --> 58:24.675
You did what you thought
was best.

58:24.718 --> 58:27.068
Julie's a smart girl.

58:27.112 --> 58:29.941
I have to win this case.

58:29.984 --> 58:32.987
Then let's win.

58:33.031 --> 58:35.033
I picked up the phone
a hundred times to call you.

58:37.296 --> 58:39.080
That would've been nice.

58:44.129 --> 58:45.783
I never got over you.

59:20.948 --> 59:22.471
It's late.

59:28.565 --> 59:29.914
Right.

59:31.393 --> 59:33.004
Come on, let's go.

59:40.620 --> 59:43.667
Mr. Pell, did the police
tell you the type of suspect

59:43.710 --> 59:45.407
they were looking for?

59:45.451 --> 59:47.018
Well, they said

59:47.061 --> 59:50.021
it was a high school teacher
got killed.

59:50.064 --> 59:52.023
So, then at that point
did it occur to you

59:52.066 --> 59:54.112
that a student
might be responsible?

59:54.155 --> 59:55.635
We talked about that.

59:55.679 --> 59:57.245
You talked about that.

59:57.289 --> 59:58.899
You and the detectives?

01:00:00.422 --> 01:00:01.989
People's exhibit 19.

01:00:03.904 --> 01:00:04.992
Does this look familiar?

01:00:07.125 --> 01:00:08.996
Sure.

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:11.433
That's the pictures
the police showed me.

01:00:11.477 --> 01:00:14.219
And that's the person
I picked out right there

01:00:14.262 --> 01:00:16.351
in the middle on the bottom row.

01:00:16.395 --> 01:00:19.659
Let the record show Mr. Pell
is pointing to Julie Plainview,

01:00:19.703 --> 01:00:22.183
the only person
in this photo lineup

01:00:22.227 --> 01:00:24.882
who appears under the age of 20.

01:00:24.925 --> 01:00:26.927
In other words, the only person

01:00:26.971 --> 01:00:28.625
who looks like a
high school student.

01:00:32.541 --> 01:00:36.284
This photo was taken from where
you were standing that night.

01:00:36.328 --> 01:00:38.286
And you're telling us
that you were able

01:00:38.330 --> 01:00:41.812
to positively identify someone
at a distance of 130 feet

01:00:41.855 --> 01:00:44.423
in the dark with the only light
coming from above

01:00:44.466 --> 01:00:46.555
and behind the person
in question?

01:00:48.296 --> 01:00:50.690
I got good eyes.

01:00:50.734 --> 01:00:53.345
Okay, then can you tell us
what the sign says

01:00:53.388 --> 01:00:54.694
on the post
next to the streetlight?

01:00:54.738 --> 01:00:56.087
Just read it out loud?

01:00:59.394 --> 01:01:01.658
It says when you can park.

01:01:04.356 --> 01:01:08.708
Let the record show the sign actually says "no littering."

01:01:08.752 --> 01:01:11.493
But nice guess, Mr. Pell.

01:01:16.194 --> 01:01:18.326
At this time, Your Honor,
the People rest.

01:01:20.285 --> 01:01:23.592
Sylvie, as Julie's best friend,

01:01:23.636 --> 01:01:25.682
did you ever hear her talk about

01:01:25.725 --> 01:01:28.380
any feelings
she had for Mr. Dutton?

01:01:28.423 --> 01:01:30.512
She never talked
about him at all.

01:01:30.556 --> 01:01:32.732
Now, when you first talked
to the police,

01:01:32.776 --> 01:01:35.517
you told them
that you were home with Julie

01:01:35.561 --> 01:01:38.042
at the time
when Mr. Dutton was killed.

01:01:38.085 --> 01:01:41.306
But in fact, you and Julie
left the house

01:01:41.349 --> 01:01:44.439
to meet two boys at the beach,
where you stayed

01:01:44.483 --> 01:01:47.747
until approximately 4:00 a.m.,
isn't that true?

01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:50.881
Yes.

01:01:50.924 --> 01:01:54.101
Will you tell the court
why you lied to the police?

01:01:56.147 --> 01:01:59.367
I knew my mom would get mad,
and Julie's mom...

01:01:59.411 --> 01:02:02.544
well, you... would be mad
if she found out

01:02:02.588 --> 01:02:04.546
we were hanging out
with older guys.

01:02:06.244 --> 01:02:07.767
I should have told the truth.

01:02:10.770 --> 01:02:12.729
Ellen:
But now you're under oath.

01:02:12.772 --> 01:02:16.776
So, will you please tell us
exactly what you and Julie

01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:19.344
were doing on the night
of June 9th?

01:02:19.387 --> 01:02:23.000
The afternoon after graduation, we met these French guys.

01:02:23.043 --> 01:02:24.653
And we told them that we
would be at our hangout,

01:02:24.697 --> 01:02:26.351
lifeguard tower 6, that night.

01:02:28.092 --> 01:02:30.442
So, we were hanging out,

01:02:30.485 --> 01:02:32.096
and these guys showed up.

01:02:32.139 --> 01:02:35.229
We talked for a few hours,

01:02:35.273 --> 01:02:37.449
and I guess

01:02:37.492 --> 01:02:39.494
we then smoked some weed.

01:02:41.322 --> 01:02:43.324
And Robert and Pascal
wanted cigarettes,

01:02:43.368 --> 01:02:46.675
so we went to find a place
that was open.

01:02:46.719 --> 01:02:48.852
After that,
they went to the airport

01:02:48.895 --> 01:02:52.072
to get a red-eye,
and I drove Julie home.

01:02:52.116 --> 01:02:54.683
But the important point
is that you and Julie

01:02:54.727 --> 01:02:56.860
were together all night.

01:02:56.903 --> 01:02:58.557
Until I dropped her off, yeah.

01:03:00.341 --> 01:03:01.734
Your witness.

01:03:05.433 --> 01:03:07.958
Sylvie...

01:03:08.001 --> 01:03:11.265
do you know what happens
if you lie on the stand?

01:03:11.309 --> 01:03:14.225
It's called perjury,
and you go to prison.

01:03:14.268 --> 01:03:15.835
I don't have to tell you
what can happen

01:03:15.879 --> 01:03:17.837
to a young woman in prison.

01:03:17.881 --> 01:03:21.493
I believe your testimony
was, "Robert and Pascal

01:03:21.536 --> 01:03:22.929
wanted to buy some cigarettes,

01:03:22.973 --> 01:03:25.845
so we went to find
a store that was open."

01:03:25.889 --> 01:03:28.326
Meaning the three of you...

01:03:28.369 --> 01:03:30.284
went to the store.

01:03:30.328 --> 01:03:34.071
In other words,
you left Julie by herself

01:03:34.114 --> 01:03:36.508
for at least 30 minutes,

01:03:36.551 --> 01:03:40.817
plenty of time to send
a text to Gene Dutton,

01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:44.255
meet him in the parking lot
five blocks away,

01:03:44.298 --> 01:03:48.694
attack the man
who almost assuredly

01:03:48.737 --> 01:03:50.696
rejected her sexual advances

01:03:50.739 --> 01:03:53.220
and rush back
to the lifeguard tower.

01:03:54.656 --> 01:03:56.484
So...

01:03:56.528 --> 01:03:59.313
let's see if I can get you
to tell me the truth this time.

01:04:00.924 --> 01:04:02.969
I'm sorry.

01:04:03.013 --> 01:04:05.276
I let that horrible
person get to me.

01:04:05.319 --> 01:04:07.669
[Sniffles]
But the idea of prison?

01:04:07.713 --> 01:04:09.410
It's okay.

01:04:13.023 --> 01:04:14.981
You told the truth, Sylvie.

01:04:15.025 --> 01:04:17.505
I really hope that I didn't
make things worse for you.

01:04:17.549 --> 01:04:20.030
Telling the truth
is always best.

01:04:21.248 --> 01:04:23.294
Sylvie.
Let's go.

01:04:44.315 --> 01:04:45.446
[Knock on door]

01:04:47.927 --> 01:04:49.059
Dinner's almost... ready.

01:04:52.671 --> 01:04:56.980
Jules, this was
a hard day for me.

01:04:57.023 --> 01:05:00.157
I don't like learning
things in court

01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:01.593
that I should have
learned from you.

01:05:04.639 --> 01:05:07.904
If you want to stay
out of prison,

01:05:07.947 --> 01:05:11.429
I need you to be
completely honest with me.

01:05:11.472 --> 01:05:12.865
Is there anything else,

01:05:12.909 --> 01:05:16.216
anything at all
you haven't told me?

01:05:16.260 --> 01:05:18.653
Well, then, I should tell you
about Mr. Dutton.

01:05:22.005 --> 01:05:24.485
I didn't stab him.

01:05:24.529 --> 01:05:26.400
And I didn't meet him in
the parking lot that night.

01:05:31.188 --> 01:05:33.407
But I did meet him before that.

01:05:38.586 --> 01:05:41.415
We used to hang out
after school...

01:05:41.459 --> 01:05:43.287
and talk.

01:05:46.159 --> 01:05:48.814
He treated me like an adult.

01:05:48.857 --> 01:05:50.163
And one night...

01:05:52.774 --> 01:05:54.472
he kissed me.

01:05:57.823 --> 01:05:59.956
And I know it was wrong.

01:05:59.999 --> 01:06:02.654
I know it was stupid,
but I let him anyway.

01:06:06.223 --> 01:06:08.965
See, that's why I didn't
tell you before.

01:06:11.402 --> 01:06:13.273
I knew you would
look at me like that.

01:06:15.928 --> 01:06:18.104
I can't deal with you
being disappointed in me.

01:06:20.759 --> 01:06:23.544
Mom, it's worse than jail.

01:06:23.588 --> 01:06:25.503
Jules.

01:06:25.546 --> 01:06:27.244
You know, I thought
we could stay friends.

01:06:31.465 --> 01:06:33.250
But he didn't want that.

01:06:37.950 --> 01:06:39.996
So, I refused to see him.

01:06:43.303 --> 01:06:45.392
That's all there is to it.

01:06:47.916 --> 01:06:49.570
Does anyone else know
about this?

01:06:56.621 --> 01:06:58.144
I'm so sorry, Mom.

01:06:59.928 --> 01:07:01.191
I should have told you.

01:07:03.410 --> 01:07:05.456
Is there any way
this could be related

01:07:05.499 --> 01:07:06.631
to why he was stabbed?

01:07:09.590 --> 01:07:11.375
No.

01:07:11.418 --> 01:07:13.507
I don't think so.

01:07:13.551 --> 01:07:16.162
Is there anything else?

01:07:19.992 --> 01:07:21.298
No.

01:07:24.214 --> 01:07:26.346
Just that dinner
smells really good.

01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:37.705
[Sighs]

01:07:59.249 --> 01:08:02.991
I've known Julie since
we were little, like, five.

01:08:03.035 --> 01:08:05.907
I've never seen her act violent

01:08:05.951 --> 01:08:10.608
or lose her temper
or even be unkind to anyone.

01:08:10.651 --> 01:08:12.262
Did you ever hear her express

01:08:12.305 --> 01:08:14.438
negative thoughts
towards Mr. Dutton?

01:08:14.481 --> 01:08:17.615
I've never heard her express
negative feelings about anyone.

01:08:17.658 --> 01:08:20.139
The idea of her going to prison,

01:08:20.183 --> 01:08:22.576
I don't even want
to think about it.

01:08:22.620 --> 01:08:23.925
Thank you, Steve.

01:08:33.370 --> 01:08:36.328
Steve, you served
as the president

01:08:36.372 --> 01:08:41.160
of North High's science fiction
and fantasy club, correct?

01:08:41.203 --> 01:08:43.031
One year I did.

01:08:43.075 --> 01:08:47.166
Safe to say you enjoy stories
about adventure and fantasy,

01:08:47.210 --> 01:08:49.473
heroes and damsels in distress?

01:08:49.515 --> 01:08:51.127
Sure.

01:08:51.170 --> 01:08:53.868
And in all the years
that you knew Julie Plainview,

01:08:53.912 --> 01:08:55.653
did you ever take her out
on a date?

01:08:58.830 --> 01:09:00.048
Not really.

01:09:00.091 --> 01:09:01.746
Why not?

01:09:01.788 --> 01:09:04.879
I don't know,
I guess it never came up.

01:09:04.923 --> 01:09:08.840
Hey, I get it.
I remember high school.

01:09:08.883 --> 01:09:13.192
When you really like someone,
and they don't like you back.

01:09:13.236 --> 01:09:15.151
Rejection's pretty tough.

01:09:18.066 --> 01:09:22.636
But now you have a chance
to be her hero, don't you?

01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:25.770
You came here today hoping
to convince this jury

01:09:25.813 --> 01:09:27.902
that Julie Plainview
could never commit the crime

01:09:27.946 --> 01:09:29.469
that she's been charged with,

01:09:29.513 --> 01:09:32.255
and if you get them
to vote not guilty,

01:09:32.298 --> 01:09:34.692
you'll be her knight
in shining armor.

01:09:34.734 --> 01:09:36.607
You'll save her from spending
the rest of her life in prison,

01:09:36.649 --> 01:09:38.174
and you would do anything

01:09:38.216 --> 01:09:40.698
to make that happen,
wouldn't you, Steve?

01:09:40.741 --> 01:09:43.179
- Julie didn't do it. She couldn't have.
- How do you know?

01:09:43.221 --> 01:09:45.832
How could you possibly know,
Steve?

01:09:45.877 --> 01:09:48.227
Because I'm the one
who killed Mr. Dutton.

01:09:48.270 --> 01:09:51.143
I knew Mr. Dutton wanted
to hook up with Julie,

01:09:51.187 --> 01:09:54.059
and I couldn't stand the idea
of him taking advantage of her.

01:09:54.102 --> 01:09:56.888
So I tricked him into meeting me
and I stabbed him!

01:09:58.803 --> 01:10:01.806
Do you honestly expect us
to believe that, Steve?

01:10:01.849 --> 01:10:04.461
I can prove it.

01:10:04.504 --> 01:10:07.115
Mr. Dutton
was wearing dark jeans

01:10:07.159 --> 01:10:09.379
and a gray button-up
when they found him, right?

01:10:09.422 --> 01:10:11.119
And he was smoking a cigarette,

01:10:11.163 --> 01:10:13.383
and nobody knows
that he smoked cigarettes.

01:10:13.426 --> 01:10:14.775
There was an astronomy book

01:10:14.819 --> 01:10:17.256
on the front seat
of his car, okay?

01:10:17.300 --> 01:10:19.389
I know because I was there!

01:10:19.432 --> 01:10:22.130
I killed Mr. Dutton,
and I'm glad!

01:10:22.174 --> 01:10:25.264
Court is in recess.

01:10:25.308 --> 01:10:28.528
Connie, would you get
the DA's office on the phone?

01:10:28.572 --> 01:10:31.488
Wait a minute, Steve said
he was in San Diego.

01:10:31.531 --> 01:10:35.143
Right, he went to go see
The Checks.

01:10:35.187 --> 01:10:37.102
He was out of town
the night of the murder.

01:10:37.145 --> 01:10:38.712
He couldn't have done it.

01:10:38.756 --> 01:10:41.062
Okay, we'll let the DA
figure that out, or not.

01:10:41.106 --> 01:10:42.847
It's not your job
to solve their case for them.

01:10:45.719 --> 01:10:47.112
Besides, Steve might have
been lying about San Diego.

01:10:47.155 --> 01:10:48.635
Maybe he did do it.

01:10:48.679 --> 01:10:50.855
You know,
let's just wait and see.

01:10:55.903 --> 01:10:57.644
What are we going to do?

01:10:59.255 --> 01:11:00.865
I don't know.

01:11:00.908 --> 01:11:04.608
What if they believe him?

01:11:04.651 --> 01:11:07.741
Then you'll be off the hook.

01:11:07.785 --> 01:11:09.700
Mom, I can't let Steve
go to prison

01:11:09.743 --> 01:11:10.614
for something he didn't do.

01:11:12.659 --> 01:11:14.531
Like you told me,

01:11:14.574 --> 01:11:16.881
the truth is
the most important thing.

01:11:20.972 --> 01:11:23.409
But you understand...

01:11:23.453 --> 01:11:25.716
this would mean you'd have
to go back to court.

01:11:28.806 --> 01:11:30.851
If I have to, I have to.

01:11:30.895 --> 01:11:33.332
I'll go talk to the DA.

01:11:33.376 --> 01:11:37.118
Good morning, Ms. Plainview.

01:11:37.162 --> 01:11:40.470
Detectives Hamer and Ogawa
questioned Steve Guiler

01:11:40.513 --> 01:11:42.254
for four hours last night.

01:11:42.298 --> 01:11:44.822
We've decided to accept
his confession

01:11:44.865 --> 01:11:47.041
and move for a mistrial.

01:11:47.085 --> 01:11:49.043
Julie doesn't want Steve Guiler

01:11:49.087 --> 01:11:51.350
to go to prison
for something he didn't do.

01:11:51.394 --> 01:11:53.526
The kid confessed.

01:11:53.570 --> 01:11:55.441
He provided details
of the murder

01:11:55.485 --> 01:11:57.661
that could only have been known
to the killer.

01:11:57.704 --> 01:12:00.925
Or someone with access
to the police report.

01:12:00.968 --> 01:12:02.448
Steve was in my house.

01:12:02.492 --> 01:12:04.363
He could have read
the case files.

01:12:06.496 --> 01:12:10.151
Steve told me that he was
at a concert in San Diego

01:12:10.195 --> 01:12:11.718
on the night of June 9th.

01:12:11.762 --> 01:12:13.372
If you check the security cameras

01:12:13.416 --> 01:12:15.287
from the Mission Bay Arena,

01:12:15.331 --> 01:12:17.811
you'll probably find him
in the crowd.

01:12:17.855 --> 01:12:21.554
So you want me to vacate
Steve Guiler's confession?

01:12:21.598 --> 01:12:23.339
Julie thinks he was
lying to protect her.

01:12:25.732 --> 01:12:28.387
You could've just kept your mouth
shut and saved her daughter.

01:12:28.431 --> 01:12:30.389
She would've been free
and clear.

01:12:30.433 --> 01:12:33.349
I might not be able to protect
Julie from the world,

01:12:33.392 --> 01:12:35.916
but I will protect her from you.

01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:36.917
Julie is innocent.

01:12:44.447 --> 01:12:48.189
No, Your Honor.
The defense rests.

01:12:48.233 --> 01:12:51.149
All right, we'll hear
closing arguments.

01:13:01.507 --> 01:13:03.248
You might be wondering

01:13:03.291 --> 01:13:06.294
why there wasn't
a better defense.

01:13:06.338 --> 01:13:08.296
The answer is simple.

01:13:08.340 --> 01:13:11.299
There is no defense
for what she did.

01:13:13.127 --> 01:13:16.130
This emotionally disturbed
young woman

01:13:16.174 --> 01:13:18.394
made a series
of terrible choices,

01:13:18.437 --> 01:13:21.658
culminating
in one final decision

01:13:21.701 --> 01:13:24.356
to plunge a knife into
an innocent man's heart.

01:13:26.097 --> 01:13:27.446
That's it.

01:13:27.490 --> 01:13:29.405
That's all there is.

01:13:29.448 --> 01:13:32.146
The evidence shows it.

01:13:32.190 --> 01:13:35.106
Mrs. Plainview
is clearly biased

01:13:35.149 --> 01:13:38.370
in favor of her daughter.

01:13:38.414 --> 01:13:43.549
But her bias has clouded
her perspective.

01:13:43.593 --> 01:13:47.510
Any clear-thinking human being
can look at this case

01:13:47.553 --> 01:13:51.383
and see that there is only one
viable option,

01:13:51.427 --> 01:13:55.343
and that is to deliver
a verdict of guilty,

01:13:55.387 --> 01:13:58.869
guilty of murder
in the first degree.

01:13:58.912 --> 01:14:00.479
Thank you.

01:14:03.482 --> 01:14:05.353
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:14:05.397 --> 01:14:07.312
the prosecution
wants you to think

01:14:07.355 --> 01:14:09.662
that Julie killed Gene Dutton,

01:14:09.706 --> 01:14:12.839
and whoever really killed
Gene Dutton

01:14:12.883 --> 01:14:15.102
wants you to think
the same thing.

01:14:15.146 --> 01:14:16.887
But I have shown you enough
reasonable doubt

01:14:16.930 --> 01:14:18.410
to acquit her...

01:14:21.195 --> 01:14:22.980
You know what?

01:14:23.023 --> 01:14:24.677
I'm not afraid
to talk about this.

01:14:27.637 --> 01:14:30.640
The thing that you're
all thinking about right now.

01:14:30.683 --> 01:14:32.032
Am I biased?

01:14:33.860 --> 01:14:36.210
Am I?

01:14:36.254 --> 01:14:37.821
I'm her mother.

01:14:39.779 --> 01:14:42.042
The day she was born
and I held her in my arms

01:14:42.086 --> 01:14:44.044
for the first time...
and any of you parents know

01:14:44.088 --> 01:14:45.785
exactly what I'm talking about...

01:14:45.829 --> 01:14:48.788
I knew I'd do
anything to protect her

01:14:48.832 --> 01:14:52.009
and give her the best life
I possibly could.

01:14:52.052 --> 01:14:55.926
So, yes, as her mother,
of course I'm biased.

01:14:58.537 --> 01:15:00.757
But as her mother,

01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:02.715
I've also had the privilege

01:15:02.759 --> 01:15:04.978
of watching her grow up.

01:15:07.372 --> 01:15:09.156
And I know that she could never
hurt anybody.

01:15:11.376 --> 01:15:13.596
I could tell you
childhood stories

01:15:13.639 --> 01:15:16.294
of her saving ladybugs
out of our pool,

01:15:16.337 --> 01:15:21.473
or making sure that nobody
sat alone on the school bus.

01:15:21.517 --> 01:15:24.041
But I don't have to.

01:15:24.084 --> 01:15:27.392
You see, we all watched
Steve Guiler sit here

01:15:27.435 --> 01:15:29.960
and confess to this very crime.

01:15:30.003 --> 01:15:32.528
What a relief, right?

01:15:32.571 --> 01:15:34.442
I mean...

01:15:34.486 --> 01:15:36.619
I get to bring Julie home.

01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:41.101
But Steve had an alibi

01:15:41.145 --> 01:15:42.755
the prosecution
didn't know about.

01:15:46.324 --> 01:15:50.154
It was Julie
and her great big heart

01:15:50.197 --> 01:15:52.765
that insisted I come forward
with it to the DA.

01:15:54.375 --> 01:15:55.246
Because...

01:15:57.074 --> 01:15:58.684
I didn't want to.

01:16:00.991 --> 01:16:02.601
But I realized something.

01:16:02.645 --> 01:16:05.169
You know, our greatest duty
as parents

01:16:05.212 --> 01:16:07.954
isn't merely to protect
our children,

01:16:07.998 --> 01:16:11.001
but to be strong enough
to set a good example

01:16:11.044 --> 01:16:13.917
even when it's harder
than you can possibly imagine.

01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:17.355
We must embody the ideals
of the kind of world

01:16:17.398 --> 01:16:20.271
we want our children to inherit,

01:16:20.314 --> 01:16:24.405
a world in which integrity,
strength,

01:16:24.449 --> 01:16:27.191
and truth prevail.

01:16:27.234 --> 01:16:29.454
And we hope that we raised them
well enough

01:16:29.497 --> 01:16:31.543
that when push comes to shove,

01:16:31.587 --> 01:16:35.547
they will listen to their heart
and make the right choices.

01:16:44.469 --> 01:16:46.993

listen to your hearts.

01:17:01.181 --> 01:17:03.880

01:17:03.923 --> 01:17:06.447
that is where true justice lies.

They found a homemade CD

There were no fingerprints,

01:19:28.764 --> 01:19:30.940
but they made a list of songs that were on the disc.

01:19:30.983 --> 01:19:32.985
Fourteen songs,
and most of them were hip-hop.

01:19:33.029 --> 01:19:34.421

Mr. Dutton hated hip-hop.

01:19:37.860 --> 01:19:39.818

He liked wild girls.

01:20:56.416 --> 01:20:57.200
Oh, Julie.

01:21:04.816 --> 01:21:07.079
Together of girls

01:21:07.123 --> 01:21:08.907
who might've been crushing
on Mr. Dutton,

01:21:08.951 --> 01:21:11.692
and if one of those girls
has the same 14 songs

01:21:11.736 --> 01:21:15.044
in her music library,
then she could be the killer.

01:21:15.087 --> 01:21:17.133
You always were smarter
than me, Julie.

01:21:17.176 --> 01:21:19.526
Prettier, more popular.

01:21:21.485 --> 01:21:23.617
I know what people say.

01:21:23.661 --> 01:21:26.229
That you only hang out with me
as a charity case.

01:21:26.272 --> 01:21:29.145
What are you talking about?

01:21:29.188 --> 01:21:31.321
You're my best friend.

01:21:31.364 --> 01:21:33.018
Then why are you going off
to college without me?

01:21:33.062 --> 01:21:34.846
What is this about?

01:21:34.890 --> 01:21:37.675
Don't play dumb, Julie.
You're no good at it.

01:21:40.373 --> 01:21:41.809
I guess I knew you were
gonna figure it out

01:21:41.853 --> 01:21:43.724
sooner or later.

01:21:43.768 --> 01:21:45.770
Figure out what?

01:21:51.558 --> 01:21:53.212
I love him.

01:21:53.256 --> 01:21:57.129
And he loved me.
I know he did.

01:21:57.173 --> 01:22:00.089
What we had went far deeper

01:22:00.132 --> 01:22:01.829
than anything you had with him.

01:22:04.484 --> 01:22:07.444
I finally found something
that was my own.

01:22:07.487 --> 01:22:10.926
Sylvie, what are you
talking about?

01:22:10.969 --> 01:22:13.406
I was ready to run away
with him.

01:22:13.450 --> 01:22:16.583
But then he made a fool of me.

01:22:16.627 --> 01:22:19.325
He said if he left with anyone,
it would be you.

01:22:21.806 --> 01:22:25.636
When I heard that,
I just about lost it.

01:22:29.901 --> 01:22:32.208
- [Phone beeps]
- Call 911.

01:22:32.251 --> 01:22:34.862
When you passed out that night,

01:22:34.906 --> 01:22:37.648
those two guys
got bored and left,

01:22:37.691 --> 01:22:40.651
leaving me with nothing,
as usual.

01:22:42.566 --> 01:22:45.438
When I saw the text
from Gene on your phone,

01:22:45.482 --> 01:22:47.658
I answered for you.

01:22:47.701 --> 01:22:49.965
I went to see him.

01:22:50.008 --> 01:22:53.098
I got him to meet me
at the parking lot.

01:22:53.142 --> 01:22:55.361
I don't know why
I took the knife

01:22:55.405 --> 01:22:57.102
from the picnic basket.

01:22:57.146 --> 01:23:00.149
You framed me?

01:23:00.192 --> 01:23:02.020
No, how could you?

01:23:02.064 --> 01:23:05.502
None of this would've happened
if it wasn't for you.

01:23:05.545 --> 01:23:08.374
My whole life,
I have compared myself to you.

01:23:08.418 --> 01:23:10.376
I've watched as you got
the grades,

01:23:10.420 --> 01:23:12.857
the guys, the attention.

01:23:12.900 --> 01:23:14.250
Not anymore.

01:23:14.293 --> 01:23:16.426
Sylvie, if you
killed Mr. Dutton,

01:23:16.469 --> 01:23:17.731
you need to confess.

01:23:17.775 --> 01:23:21.257
I can't go to prison.

01:23:21.300 --> 01:23:23.520
And I'm not gonna let you
send me there.

01:23:32.094 --> 01:23:33.834
You don't think you're going
to get away with this, do you?

01:23:36.446 --> 01:23:39.362
The police know there's somebody
stabbing people in this area.

01:23:41.364 --> 01:23:42.887
Probably some creep.

01:23:48.806 --> 01:23:50.286
Sylvie, please stop.

01:23:50.329 --> 01:23:51.591
I'm sorry, Jules.

01:23:51.635 --> 01:23:52.766
Please stop.

01:24:00.035 --> 01:24:00.948
Julie!

01:24:03.690 --> 01:24:04.952
Mommy!

01:24:04.996 --> 01:24:06.693
Mommy can't help you now.

01:24:24.102 --> 01:24:25.799
Mom, are you okay?

01:24:36.114 --> 01:24:38.160
Judge:
The motion for acquittal is granted,

01:24:38.203 --> 01:24:40.684
and the case against
Julie Anne Plainview

01:24:40.727 --> 01:24:42.164
is hereby dismissed.

01:24:44.949 --> 01:24:47.038
Whoa, Ellen! Ellen!

01:24:47.082 --> 01:24:49.127
Whoa, hold it up,
hold it up, hold it up.

01:24:49.171 --> 01:24:51.608
Congratulations on your victory.

01:24:51.651 --> 01:24:54.567
Look what I happen to have
with me, yeah.

01:24:54.611 --> 01:24:56.656
I don't normally carry it,
but anyway, I was hoping

01:24:56.700 --> 01:24:59.006
that you could, I don't know,
just autograph it for me?

01:24:59.050 --> 01:25:01.226
Actually, it's for my niece
because she's a big fan

01:25:01.270 --> 01:25:02.706
of these sort of books.

01:25:02.749 --> 01:25:04.664
You know that I'm not
the author.

01:25:04.708 --> 01:25:07.145
But you're kind of the star
of the book, so would you mind?

01:25:07.189 --> 01:25:09.191
Have you actually read the book?

01:25:09.234 --> 01:25:12.194
No, no, not yet.
Um... here you go.

01:25:12.237 --> 01:25:15.240
Wait, wait, wait, wait, okay.

01:25:15.284 --> 01:25:17.155
Just, I don't know,
write something about me.

01:25:21.116 --> 01:25:22.291
Thank you.

01:25:22.334 --> 01:25:23.466
Enjoy the read.

01:25:23.509 --> 01:25:25.120
Congratulations.

01:25:25.163 --> 01:25:26.686
[Chuckles]

01:25:29.167 --> 01:25:30.560
Hey, wh-what...

01:25:30.603 --> 01:25:32.039
What is that supposed to mean?

01:25:34.607 --> 01:25:36.479
You know, I just had a great
interview with Judge Tannin

01:25:36.522 --> 01:25:38.176
for the book that I'm writing
about your case.

01:25:38.220 --> 01:25:40.135
When this book comes out,

01:25:40.178 --> 01:25:42.311
you are going to be
a pretty popular lawyer.

01:25:42.354 --> 01:25:43.877
I hope you're ready for that.

01:25:43.921 --> 01:25:47.185
I will be.
After a little time off.

01:25:47.229 --> 01:25:50.928
I'm taking Julie to Paris
before she starts college.

01:25:50.971 --> 01:25:53.887
Ah, très bien!
What's your major?

01:25:53.931 --> 01:25:56.499
English, and then I'm gonna
go to law school after that.

01:25:56.542 --> 01:25:58.718
- Really?
- Mm-hmm. I've been inspired.

01:25:58.762 --> 01:26:01.199
Ms. Plainview.

01:26:01.243 --> 01:26:03.810
I'd like to apologize if I
was testy in the courtroom.

01:26:03.854 --> 01:26:05.247
I guess my job

01:26:05.290 --> 01:26:07.901
is turning me into a grouch.

01:26:07.945 --> 01:26:10.121
I'd like to thank you for
helping us solve the case, too.

01:26:10.165 --> 01:26:11.644
If you want to join the force,

01:26:11.688 --> 01:26:13.646
I think you'd make
a pretty good detective.

01:26:13.690 --> 01:26:15.257
Thank you.

01:26:15.300 --> 01:26:17.346
But I like being a lawyer.

01:26:19.043 --> 01:26:21.306
And one day I hope
the sign on the door

01:26:21.350 --> 01:26:24.875
will read "Plainview
and Plainview."

01:26:24.918 --> 01:26:26.790
And then you'll have
both of us to contend with.

01:26:26.833 --> 01:26:29.532
Well, good luck to you.

01:26:29.575 --> 01:26:30.620
Thank you.

01:26:34.537 --> 01:26:35.668
You ready?

01:26:35.712 --> 01:26:37.192
Yeah.

01:26:37.235 --> 01:26:39.237
"Plainview and Plainview."

01:26:39.281 --> 01:26:40.891
I kind of like that.

01:26:40.934 --> 01:26:43.676
It's almost like
it's a book series.

01:26:43.720 --> 01:26:46.331
"The Ellen Plainview
Mysteries."

01:26:46.375 --> 01:26:48.812
Or, "The Wrong Woman
Mysteries."
