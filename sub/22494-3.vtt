00:37.466 --> 00:39.734
You take the blue
pill, our story ends.

00:39.768 --> 00:43.004
You take the red pill, you stay
in Wonderland, and I show you

00:43.038 --> 00:45.373
how deep the rabbit hole goes.

00:55.717 --> 00:57.685
Oh, hello, rabbit hole.

01:01.523 --> 01:03.457
Cy-Kill is on our tail, Scooter.

01:03.492 --> 01:04.659
We need to go faster.

01:04.693 --> 01:06.761
No problem, Leader-1.

01:06.795 --> 01:10.031
Initiating walker mode!

01:10.065 --> 01:17.271
Hold onto your go-butt!

01:17.305 --> 01:19.273
Let's cut this sketch.

01:21.410 --> 01:24.145
Welp, they cut NASA's budget again!

01:24.179 --> 01:26.547
Early retirement with no benefits!

01:26.581 --> 01:29.717
I... I-I think I might be
having a breakdown, Jeannie.

01:29.751 --> 01:30.484
Oh, no!

01:30.519 --> 01:31.919
Does master need a back rub?

01:31.953 --> 01:33.320
Are you listening to me?!

01:33.355 --> 01:35.222
Master needs a damn minute to himself!

01:35.257 --> 01:35.690
Hmph!

01:35.724 --> 01:37.558
Maybe I'll just spend
the night in my bottle.

01:37.592 --> 01:40.027
Your bottle's gonna spend the
night up your ass if you don't

01:40.062 --> 01:43.130
conjure up some whiskey
and a fistful of pills!

01:48.003 --> 01:50.004
All right, main boosters
are ready for a "go. "

01:50.038 --> 01:52.473
It's a beautiful morning for a
launch, ladies and gentlemen.

01:53.241 --> 01:57.311
Uh, hold on.

01:57.345 --> 01:59.980
Uh, Charlie Delta, there appears
to be a giant old-timey lollipop

02:00.015 --> 02:01.816
with an erection
approaching your shuttle.

02:01.850 --> 02:03.050
Be on aware.

02:06.488 --> 02:09.957
I'm here for my
exit interview, space

02:09.991 --> 02:11.592
Master! Oh, please!

02:11.626 --> 02:15.262
Please wish for it to
start raining eyeballs?!

02:16.231 --> 02:18.365
You got it!

02:18.400 --> 02:21.068
Gentlemen, we have some weather.

02:21.103 --> 02:27.708
I am Mictecacihuatl, the
Aztec goddess of death!

02:27.743 --> 02:28.876
Aah!

02:30.112 --> 02:33.681
Uh, mission control, we have
a visual on the cast of

02:33.715 --> 02:36.484
"Good Times" chewing on the
fuel cable for thruster three.

02:36.518 --> 02:40.554
Jimmie " J. J." "Kid Dy-no-mite" Walker
is almost through the insulation.

02:40.589 --> 02:42.089
Can you confirm? Over.

02:42.124 --> 02:43.924
Negative, Charlie Delta.

02:43.959 --> 02:48.062
Attempting to communicate with a
sentient Victorian doll, over.

02:50.632 --> 02:52.299
I now know what hell sounds like.

02:52.334 --> 02:54.735
Recommend a tactical nuclear
strike at my position.

02:54.770 --> 02:56.370
Tell my family I love them.

02:56.404 --> 02:58.038
Oh, there, there, master.

02:58.073 --> 02:59.440
Yes.

02:59.474 --> 03:01.041
A giant butt!

03:01.076 --> 03:04.578
Oh, I showed them all, didn't I?

03:04.613 --> 03:06.180
Oh.

03:08.683 --> 03:10.417
Did you bring the money?

03:10.452 --> 03:12.153
It's right here.

03:12.187 --> 03:15.389
It's all there, you son of a bitch...
$5 million in bearer bonds.

03:15.423 --> 03:16.457
Now give me my son!

03:17.325 --> 03:17.925
Jayden!

03:17.959 --> 03:19.026
Daddy!

03:19.060 --> 03:20.561
Thank God!

03:20.595 --> 03:22.296
Okay, guess we're all done here.

03:22.330 --> 03:23.697
Okay. Yeah. I-I guess we are.

03:23.732 --> 03:25.533
Unless you went to the cops!

03:25.567 --> 03:26.500
You said no cops.

03:26.535 --> 03:29.170
Is some sniper gonna
kill me the second I walk away?

03:29.204 --> 03:29.570
No.

03:29.604 --> 03:31.572
Is there a trace
in this briefcase?

03:31.606 --> 03:32.006
No.

03:32.040 --> 03:34.074
Are you just gonna kidnap
my son again later?

03:34.109 --> 03:34.842
Why would I?

03:34.876 --> 03:37.511
I have $5 million.

03:44.986 --> 03:49.957
We'll be right back with another
thrilling tale of... Bark! Bark!

03:49.991 --> 03:50.791
You're doing it!

03:50.826 --> 03:51.492
Bark! Bark!

03:51.526 --> 03:53.027
Good girl, Lassie!

03:53.061 --> 03:54.929
Oh, you bitch!

03:55.797 --> 03:56.764
Apologies, my dear.

03:56.798 --> 04:00.234
It's...
Kind of what I am known for.

04:03.371 --> 04:06.006
Daddy, how do they get
the cork in the bottle?

04:06.041 --> 04:08.342
Well, Abigail...

04:11.112 --> 04:13.547
Ungh! Aaaaah!

04:15.450 --> 04:17.384
Stop crying and tell lies!

04:17.418 --> 04:21.922
A- Abigail is a good little girl!

04:21.957 --> 04:22.890
Ungh! Aaaaah!

04:22.924 --> 04:24.425
W- what?

04:24.459 --> 04:24.992
Yep.

04:25.026 --> 04:27.528
Pinocchio must have read your diary.

04:37.739 --> 04:38.272
Whoo!

04:38.306 --> 04:41.242
# Everything in this jungle
wanna eat you, baby #

04:41.276 --> 04:44.011
# I can't blame 'em,
'cause you look so fine #

04:44.045 --> 04:45.846
# I want to give you sexual rabies #

04:45.881 --> 04:46.881
# sexual rabies #

04:46.915 --> 04:49.650
# gimme that sweet,
sweet monkey vagine #

04:49.684 --> 04:52.253
# though I want to put
your pelvis in traction #

04:52.287 --> 04:55.022
# on Pandora, the main attraction is #

04:55.056 --> 04:58.092
# blue rabbits #

04:58.126 --> 04:58.525
Whoo!

04:58.560 --> 05:00.861
# Blue rabbits Yeah #

05:00.896 --> 05:02.997
Whoo!

05:03.031 --> 05:06.033
# Blue rabbits #

05:06.067 --> 05:09.737
# you know, you won't see rabbit
sex in "The Lord of the Rings" #

05:09.771 --> 05:12.306
# smack her in the ass
with your ponytail thing #

05:12.340 --> 05:15.376
# Jake Sully was a soldier
in a bad position #

05:15.410 --> 05:17.945
# he won't be scoring with
that spinal condition #

05:17.979 --> 05:20.581
# they put him in a body
with a tail and fangs #

05:20.615 --> 05:22.149
# and what we are presuming is an #

05:22.183 --> 05:23.317
# indigo wang #

05:23.351 --> 05:25.886
# now he's gonna nail all
the beaver he wanna #

05:25.921 --> 05:31.458
# while the animators spank
it to Zoe Zaldana-a-a #

05:31.493 --> 05:32.960
# and now we've got #

05:32.994 --> 05:35.963
# blue rabbits #

05:35.997 --> 05:36.697
Whoo!

05:36.731 --> 05:39.133
# Blue rabbits Yeah #

05:39.167 --> 05:41.101
Whoo!

05:41.136 --> 05:43.437
# Blue rabbits #

05:43.471 --> 05:44.605
# blue rabbits #

05:44.673 --> 05:45.439
Everywhere! #

05:45.473 --> 05:47.508
And now a word from James Cameron.

05:47.542 --> 05:49.276
Ork! Ork! Ork! Ork! Ork!

05:49.311 --> 05:51.412
# This whole planet's
got stench #

05:51.446 --> 05:53.814
# you can smell it on the other... #

05:53.848 --> 05:57.751
Yay!

05:59.321 --> 06:01.789
Got to go!

06:03.725 --> 06:06.994
And that's why bottled water
is an $8 billion industry.

06:07.028 --> 06:09.697
Getting it clean.

06:09.731 --> 06:10.998
I'm sorry, Twiki.

06:11.032 --> 06:13.734
You have diabete-bete-betes.

06:13.768 --> 06:16.670
This lasik procedure shouldn't
take very long, Fred.

06:16.705 --> 06:18.739
The success rate is very, very low.

06:18.773 --> 06:20.274
You think this is bad?

06:20.308 --> 06:24.244
My last job was giving late-term
abortions to unwed teens.

06:25.880 --> 06:28.983
Dean Proffitt, since you knew
that wealthy socialite had

06:29.017 --> 06:32.720
amnesia, your actions amount to
kidnapping, forced servitude, and rape.

06:32.754 --> 06:34.288
The court sentences you to death.

06:34.322 --> 06:36.190
Oh! Hey, hey!

06:36.224 --> 06:39.026
<i>Let's not go overboard. </i>

06:41.429 --> 06:42.629
<i>Okay, you can go. </i>

06:42.664 --> 06:44.665
<i>Whoo-hoo!</i>

06:45.667 --> 06:47.434
<i>I've had the best time tonight. </i>

06:47.469 --> 06:48.035
<i>Me too. </i>

06:48.069 --> 06:51.138
<i>You know, when Jennifer said she
had a cute friend, I had no idea</i>

06:51.172 --> 06:52.606
<i>she'd be a silverhawk. </i>

06:52.640 --> 06:56.510
<i>Let's, um...
Skip dessert. </i>

06:56.544 --> 06:58.112
<i>What do you think?</i>

06:58.146 --> 07:01.215
<i>That is so hot!</i>

07:01.950 --> 07:03.517
<i>How do I take your armor off?</i>

07:03.551 --> 07:04.218
<i>Armor?</i>

07:05.053 --> 07:05.986
<i>That's my body. </i>

07:06.021 --> 07:07.354
<i>W-what?</i>

07:07.389 --> 07:08.989
<i>Partly metal, partly real?</i>

07:09.024 --> 07:10.324
<i>It's in our theme song. </i>

07:10.358 --> 07:11.125
<i>Oh. Yeah. </i>

07:11.159 --> 07:12.793
<i>I-I, uh...
So, well... So how do we?</i>

07:12.827 --> 07:16.630
<i> Just pound on my crotch with
this ball-peen hammer. </i>

07:17.399 --> 07:18.265
<i>Oh, yes! Yes!</i>

07:18.299 --> 07:19.533
<i>Yeah? Am I doing it?</i>

07:19.567 --> 07:21.001
<i>Harder! Do it! Okay! Yes!</i>

07:21.036 --> 07:22.536
<i>All right. I'm swinging it. </i>

07:22.570 --> 07:23.904
<i>Yeah, yeah. You like that?</i>

07:23.938 --> 07:24.605
<i>Yeah, yeah. </i>

07:24.639 --> 07:25.973
<i>Is this doing something?</i>

07:26.007 --> 07:27.074
<i>Ow! Oh, piss on it!</i>

07:27.108 --> 07:28.008
<i>I hit my thumb!</i>

07:29.210 --> 07:31.311
<i>Shh. Do you hear that?</i>

07:35.717 --> 07:37.785
<i>I think I want to go home now. </i>

07:37.819 --> 07:41.255
<i>Are you ready for another
incredible adventure?</i>

07:41.289 --> 07:42.322
<i>Yeah!</i>

07:42.357 --> 07:44.691
<i>Casper?</i>

07:44.726 --> 07:46.393
<i>Oh, no. It's my mom. </i>

07:46.428 --> 07:47.661
<i>Oh, my God! Casper!</i>

07:47.695 --> 07:48.929
<i>You've come back to me!</i>

07:48.963 --> 07:49.696
<i>No, mom. </i>

07:49.731 --> 07:52.699
<i>I came back to have fun
adventures with my new friends. </i>

07:52.734 --> 07:53.133
<i>Duh. </i>

07:53.168 --> 07:54.201
<i>New friends?</i>

07:54.235 --> 07:57.504
<i>Casper, I've been crying every
day for the last two years!</i>

07:57.539 --> 08:00.541
<i>Why'd you have to
play by the pool, Casper?!</i>

08:00.575 --> 08:01.575
<i>Come on, guys. </i>

08:01.609 --> 08:04.478
<i>Let's ditch this wet
blanket and play!</i>

08:05.580 --> 08:09.249
<i>This next tale of terror follows
the unusual death of one</i>

08:09.284 --> 08:12.553
<i>Chet Masterson, who...
Wait a minute. </i>

08:12.587 --> 08:14.154
<i>I knew a Chet Masterson. </i>

08:14.189 --> 08:16.824
<i>Can we find out if...
I- it's the same one?</i>

08:16.858 --> 08:19.126
<i>No, I guess that was a
couple months ago. </i>

08:19.160 --> 08:20.694
<i>He's dead? You're kidding me. </i>

08:20.728 --> 08:22.296
<i>No. No. I can't do this, guys. </i>

08:22.330 --> 08:23.497
<i>It wouldn't be right. </i>

08:23.531 --> 08:24.198
<i>I knew him. </i>

08:24.232 --> 08:25.499
<i>No! you, Jerry!</i>

08:25.533 --> 08:27.167
I'm not reading it!

08:30.772 --> 08:33.640
"Debbie Does Dallas"?

08:33.674 --> 08:35.109
"Taboo"?

08:35.143 --> 08:38.645
The collected works of Eva Angelina!

08:38.679 --> 08:44.017
Finally, I have time...
All the time in the world!

08:44.419 --> 08:45.886
Ooh! Oop!

08:45.920 --> 08:47.154
No.

08:47.188 --> 08:48.856
That's not fair.

08:48.890 --> 08:50.757
There was time now.

08:50.792 --> 08:53.727
There was finally time!

08:56.097 --> 08:59.566
Now, Joes, keep your faces right
in the dirt and...

08:59.601 --> 09:00.634
Oh! What the hell?!

09:00.668 --> 09:02.102
This smells like dog

09:02.937 --> 09:05.038
Duke, looks like you
just rolled craps!

09:06.741 --> 09:07.774
Doo-doo head!

09:08.643 --> 09:09.076
Hey!

09:10.044 --> 09:10.344
Hey!

09:11.179 --> 09:11.578
Hey!

09:11.613 --> 09:12.613
All right, Joes.

09:12.647 --> 09:15.048
We've got work to do, so...

09:15.083 --> 09:17.050
Aw, a cat pissed in my helmet!

09:17.085 --> 09:18.018
Sorry, Duke.

09:18.052 --> 09:19.520
That was my sidekick, Cat Scan.

09:19.554 --> 09:21.955
Why is everyone bringing
animals into the pit?!

09:21.990 --> 09:25.259
It's all right here in the handbook, Duke...
One animal per Joe.

09:25.293 --> 09:26.160
Wait a minute.

09:26.194 --> 09:28.262
You mean we all get a pet?

09:34.969 --> 09:36.470
The element of surprise.

09:36.504 --> 09:39.273
Duke to Gung-Ho, you better be ready.

09:39.307 --> 09:40.274
Ready, Duke.

09:40.308 --> 09:44.111
These cobras won't know what...

09:44.145 --> 09:45.379
Quiet, Dumbolaya!

09:45.413 --> 09:48.682
For the love of... Dumbo!

09:48.716 --> 09:50.184
Oh, the sneak attack is blown.

09:50.218 --> 09:51.118
All Joes attack!

09:51.152 --> 09:52.519
Here we go, Stink Bomb.

09:52.554 --> 09:53.587
Let's roast some snakes.

09:55.623 --> 09:56.857
No! This can't be going on!

09:56.891 --> 09:57.524
Oh, me bones!

09:57.559 --> 09:58.825
Oh, they're torchin' me bones!

09:58.860 --> 10:00.694
I've torched my own bones!

10:00.728 --> 10:04.097
Eat throwing star, cobra scum.

10:05.266 --> 10:09.503
Lumpy, no!

10:11.606 --> 10:13.707
Roses are red, pansies are orange.

10:13.741 --> 10:15.676
I love killing cobras... Ow!

10:23.351 --> 10:25.385
Oh, no! The animals!

10:25.420 --> 10:27.287
The animals have ruined everything!

10:27.322 --> 10:28.021
No, Duke.

10:28.056 --> 10:31.325
There's still one more pet... Mine.

10:36.731 --> 10:39.333
Deep Six, that's medal of
honor material right there.

10:39.367 --> 10:41.435
Oh, look out.

10:42.470 --> 10:44.771
In your face, everyone
who said I was useless!

11:02.890 --> 11:05.292
