Trimming snowball's nails
is not the easiest,

00:08.709 --> 00:09.975
So thanks again, lara.

00:10.110 --> 00:11.710
I mean, not what I went
to vet school for,

00:11.845 --> 00:14.446
But it's fine. I don't mind
doing a one-time favour.

00:14.515 --> 00:16.315
This one time.

00:16.317 --> 00:18.983
Grand. Lara is our best
and only vet,

00:19.020 --> 00:20.853
So you behave, got it?

00:20.855 --> 00:22.921
She doesn't answer. Although can
you imagine what would she say?

00:23.057 --> 00:24.923
Can we get on with this?

00:24.925 --> 00:28.460
(laughing) yeah. That does sound
like her. What a diva.

00:28.462 --> 00:30.595
No. I mean, I've got to remove
a dog's spleen in 10, so--

00:30.631 --> 00:33.031
Right, right. Okay.

00:33.067 --> 00:35.467
I'll let you do your thang.

00:35.536 --> 00:38.003
(snowball whining)

00:38.072 --> 00:40.439
(growling)

00:40.574 --> 00:42.741
Oh.
Don't grip her paw too tight.

00:42.876 --> 00:45.210
Sorry. My faux pas.

00:45.345 --> 00:47.612
In my head,
"pas" was spelled p-a-w.

00:47.648 --> 00:50.616
(growling, meowing)

00:50.751 --> 00:52.084
Oh, she, uh--

00:52.153 --> 00:53.886
Uh, I did a surgical rotation
in tonga.

00:54.021 --> 00:55.754
I think I can trim your
cat's nails without guidance.

00:55.823 --> 00:56.955
Absolutely.

00:57.091 --> 00:58.690
(growling)

00:58.726 --> 01:01.026
Um, yeah.

01:01.161 --> 01:02.961
Okay.

01:03.097 --> 01:05.363
Is there a way that you usually
calm her?

01:05.399 --> 01:07.499
I just stroke her ears.

01:07.568 --> 01:08.967
Okay.
I can show you.

01:08.969 --> 01:10.168
Oh...

01:10.237 --> 01:12.070
Wow.
That is relaxing.

01:12.073 --> 01:14.139
Nikki:
Why did kristian schedule me

01:14.141 --> 01:16.308

I don't work fridays...

These are the rosarios.

01:41.469 --> 01:42.935
Oh, nice to meet you.

01:43.070 --> 01:44.602
Any friend of joy's
is a friend of mine.

01:44.638 --> 01:46.070
Who's joy?
I'm joy.

01:46.107 --> 01:48.006
We're here to get baxter.

01:48.042 --> 01:50.742
Oh, you're adopting one of our
furry friends. Congratulations.

01:52.079 --> 01:53.345
Joy?

01:53.414 --> 01:55.213
Hmm?
Sorry. Just a sec.

01:55.249 --> 01:56.815
I thought you were helping
the rosarios.

01:56.884 --> 02:00.285
Oh. No, no, no. I deal
with numbers, not animals.

02:00.420 --> 02:02.554
The last director, todd,
was very clear about that.

02:02.689 --> 02:05.190
"stick to your lane, jane."
he called you jane?

02:05.325 --> 02:06.825
Only the first three years.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.594
Well, todd is
not here anymore. I am.

02:08.729 --> 02:10.696
And everybody's got to jump in,
get their hands dirty.

02:10.698 --> 02:11.830
Team effort.

02:11.965 --> 02:14.232
Okay. Wow. Exciting.

02:14.301 --> 02:15.834
Uh, just two quick questions:

02:15.903 --> 02:17.702
Are the adoption forms
in the back,

02:17.771 --> 02:19.237
And do I have to give
the animals needles?

02:19.273 --> 02:21.173
Please don't give
anyone needles.

02:21.308 --> 02:22.707
We already filled
out the application.

02:22.776 --> 02:24.209
We're just here
to pick up.

02:24.278 --> 02:26.444
Oh, thank god.
Congratulations again.

02:28.115 --> 02:31.383
Okay. Well... Right this way.

02:31.518 --> 02:32.851
(chuckling)

02:32.986 --> 02:34.919
Good news
about the needles, huh?

02:37.525 --> 02:38.656
(whining)

02:38.692 --> 02:41.459
What a sausage party.

02:41.495 --> 02:42.794
I know I call everything that,

02:42.796 --> 02:44.462
But oktoberfest
is the real deal.

02:44.498 --> 02:47.332
I'm so bloated
from that salty bratwurst

02:47.467 --> 02:49.133
I can barely get my feet
in my shoes. Hold on. One sec.

02:49.170 --> 02:51.202
(retching, gasping)

02:51.238 --> 02:53.539
Okay. False alarm.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.473
Ugh. I'm never drinking again.

02:55.543 --> 02:58.843
Oh, nikki, I try to be positive.

02:58.879 --> 03:00.545
Oh, can you hold on
one sec?

03:00.614 --> 03:02.981
I'm kind of
on my break, so--

03:02.983 --> 03:05.217
You came to work 15 minutes ago

03:05.352 --> 03:07.085
And drank my green tea latté.

03:07.121 --> 03:10.289
Well, it's called self-care,
and my morale is a bit low

03:10.424 --> 03:13.158
'cause somebody scheduled me
to work Friday.

03:13.293 --> 03:14.693
Friday is one of the weekdays

03:14.695 --> 03:15.961
In which everybody works.

03:15.963 --> 03:18.964
That's herd mentality.

03:18.966 --> 03:20.999
And I'm trying, okay?
But my feet are swollen,

03:21.134 --> 03:24.002
I'm exhausted, and
are you wearing cologne?

03:24.038 --> 03:25.904
It's musk.

03:25.906 --> 03:28.172
The animals bully me less when I
wear it.

03:28.209 --> 03:30.041
It's not helping.
I threw up twice this morning.

03:30.110 --> 03:31.576
That's what that was.

03:31.612 --> 03:33.511
Oh, god.

03:33.513 --> 03:34.947
And now I have to pee again.

03:35.082 --> 03:36.982
It feels like
someone's sitting on my bladder.

03:37.051 --> 03:38.817
This is private.
Sorry.

03:40.754 --> 03:43.388
No, I told you.
I can't drink.

03:43.390 --> 03:45.724
No. I got to put other things
ahead of partying right now.

03:45.726 --> 03:49.061
No. Of course I can have
white claws.

03:49.196 --> 03:50.395
It's basically fruit punch.

03:50.530 --> 03:52.664
(laughing)

03:52.666 --> 03:55.000
Thanks for these.
A lot of information here.

03:55.002 --> 03:56.535
Shelter board meeting
and you're the chair.

03:56.670 --> 03:57.602
Don't want you
winging it.

03:57.671 --> 03:59.404
Oh, no chance of that.

03:59.440 --> 04:02.140
Ooh. I started moving things
into the condo. So exciting.

04:02.276 --> 04:04.142
Yeah. I noticed all the boxes
in the hallway.

04:04.211 --> 04:05.644
Hoarder alert. Sometimes
I fantasize

04:05.646 --> 04:07.279
About being robbed just
so I can downsize.

04:07.348 --> 04:09.414
Don't joke. I've been robbed.
It's not pretty.

04:09.549 --> 04:11.116
You've been robbed?
Yep.

04:11.118 --> 04:13.418
Tell me who did it
and I'll crush him like a grape.

04:13.487 --> 04:15.820
Oh, no thanks. It happened,
like, a million years ago.

04:15.856 --> 04:19.024
But imagine waking up to masked
intruders in your apartment.

04:19.093 --> 04:21.392
Oh, my god. In our building?
Should I buy pepper spray?

04:21.428 --> 04:23.962
No. Different apartment.
(sighing)

04:24.097 --> 04:26.164
Hugh and I had just started
dating. I was in my room

04:26.300 --> 04:27.899
When I heard these guys
downstairs whispering.

04:27.901 --> 04:29.501
"come on, peaches.

04:29.570 --> 04:31.570
Leave the architectural digest,
peaches."

04:31.572 --> 04:33.838
So, I grabbed
a cordless massager

04:33.874 --> 04:35.774
Hugh had bought me
and I crept downstairs.

04:35.909 --> 04:39.244
I have never felt so wired
and yet... Relaxed.

04:39.379 --> 04:41.245
And then what happened?
I smashed peaches over the head,

04:41.282 --> 04:43.582
Then tripped his friend with
the massager's charging station.

04:43.584 --> 04:44.916
Oh, my god.

04:45.052 --> 04:46.318
And I bunzed the massager
for a vitamix.

04:46.387 --> 04:47.752
I would die for a vitamix.

04:47.788 --> 04:50.455
Though I'm glad
you didn't have to.

04:55.062 --> 04:56.395
Hey.

04:56.397 --> 04:58.063
Sorry. Don't mean to
bother you.

04:58.198 --> 04:59.998
Just need some signatures
on cheques.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.333
Sure, and then I might just have
to get snowball home

05:02.369 --> 05:04.136
Before her separation anxiety
kicks in.

05:04.271 --> 05:05.470
Uh, I feel that.

05:05.605 --> 05:07.739
My mom gives me vitamins
to calm me down.

05:07.808 --> 05:09.741
Joy, those are benzos.

05:09.876 --> 05:12.244
I don't know vitamins by name,
but they sure take the edge off.

05:12.246 --> 05:14.813
I don't understand.
I left her right here.

05:14.815 --> 05:16.081
(meowing)

05:16.083 --> 05:19.084
Ah. There she is.
Hiya, snowy.

05:19.086 --> 05:20.786
Uh, that's not snowball.
Snowball is smoky white.

05:20.788 --> 05:22.487
This cat is mascarpone, at best.

05:22.622 --> 05:24.356
And snowball has got
persian ears, not oval.

05:24.491 --> 05:26.558
She probably
just looks different

05:26.627 --> 05:28.260
Because you're seeing her here
and not at home.

05:28.395 --> 05:30.128
Kind of like when you see
a co-worker outside of work

05:30.263 --> 05:32.297
And you panic
and pretend to be a mannequin.

05:32.299 --> 05:35.233
Joy, which cat did you give
the rosarios today?

05:37.804 --> 05:39.671
Baxter.

05:39.673 --> 05:43.908
Kind of grey-white,
pale green eyes, pointy ears.

05:43.977 --> 05:45.476
Joy, did you give away my cat?

05:45.512 --> 05:47.412
Oh, my god.
Joy!

05:47.414 --> 05:48.580
You told me
I was ready.

05:48.649 --> 05:50.382
Her name is on her collar.

05:50.517 --> 05:52.617
Well, then, maybe it got buried
in her mascarpone fur.

05:52.619 --> 05:55.654
It's smoky white. Oh, my god.
She's probably so scared.

05:55.656 --> 05:57.489
Of course she's scared.
She thinks you abandoned her.

05:57.624 --> 05:59.190
Okay. That's not helping.

05:59.259 --> 06:00.926
Can you just call
the rosarios, please?
I will.

06:01.061 --> 06:03.395
And I'll make sure snowball
knows this wasn't your fault.

06:03.530 --> 06:05.897
Except the whole
bringing-her-to-work part, but--

06:05.966 --> 06:07.132
Yeah. I'm on it.
I'm on it.

06:07.201 --> 06:09.267
(exhaling sharply)
(meowing)

06:11.138 --> 06:13.104
(grunting)

06:14.341 --> 06:15.940
Hey.

06:15.976 --> 06:17.876
Maybe you shouldn't be carrying
these heavy things.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.144
It's fine.

06:19.213 --> 06:20.512
Of course, I am a feminist,

06:20.514 --> 06:22.013
And normally
I would never stop you

06:22.082 --> 06:24.182
From carrying whatever it is
that you want to carry.

06:24.218 --> 06:25.683
But just maybe not right now.

06:25.753 --> 06:27.152
Sweet. I'm out.

06:27.287 --> 06:29.087
No.
I didn't mean leave work.

06:29.089 --> 06:30.555
Sit down.

06:30.557 --> 06:33.024
I know that your feet are
swollen.

06:33.026 --> 06:35.159
Well, brought it on myself.

06:36.697 --> 06:39.330
I just couldn't resist
a sausage, you know?

06:39.400 --> 06:40.965
Ah.
Mmm.

06:41.001 --> 06:42.567
Colourful, but yes.

06:42.603 --> 06:45.336
I get it that your
biological clock is ticking.

06:45.372 --> 06:46.971
What?
I'm sorry.

06:47.040 --> 06:49.174
I heard you on the phone
with your friend before,

06:49.176 --> 06:51.209
And I hope I didn't
stress out you

06:51.344 --> 06:53.912
Or the little life
that you are carrying in there.

06:53.981 --> 06:55.447
Oh, my god.

06:55.449 --> 06:56.848
I know that it's early

06:56.884 --> 06:58.516
And you're probably
not telling people yet,

06:58.552 --> 07:01.052
But as your supervisor,
if there is anything you need,

07:01.054 --> 07:02.453
Now I get it.

07:02.489 --> 07:04.055
The lethargy and the mood swings
and all the time

07:04.190 --> 07:06.224
You spend in the bathroom.

07:06.359 --> 07:07.592
Yeah.

07:07.594 --> 07:09.394
Well, that's why
I needed Friday off.

07:09.529 --> 07:10.929
For the baby.

07:11.064 --> 07:12.530
Of course.

07:12.666 --> 07:14.165
Whatever you need,
consider it done.

07:14.201 --> 07:15.733
Appointments or whatever.

07:15.769 --> 07:19.670
Oh, I got a ton of that
pre-lamaze natal crap coming up,

07:19.706 --> 07:21.940
You know?
Next Thursday and Friday.

07:21.942 --> 07:24.943
Mostly right after lunch, but
also first thing in the morning.

07:24.945 --> 07:27.445
Wow. You and your partner
are taking this seriously,

07:27.448 --> 07:28.947
Which is awesome.

07:29.082 --> 07:31.148
Well, marko, my baby daddy,
is super-stoked.

07:31.185 --> 07:33.017
He's all,
"oh, my god. A mini-me."

07:33.053 --> 07:35.019
And I'm, like,
"oh, my god. Stop."

07:35.055 --> 07:37.022
(chuckling) yeah. Well, it's
great that you're supported.

07:37.157 --> 07:40.225
Uh-huh. Would you mind passing
me one of those blankets?

07:40.294 --> 07:42.961
Ooh. The first semester
is supposed to be the hardest,

07:42.963 --> 07:46.031
So I'm def going to need
nappage.

07:46.166 --> 07:47.832
Oh. Uh, sure. Now?

07:47.835 --> 07:49.634
Good.

07:49.636 --> 07:51.603
Ooh. Ooh, mm-hmm.

07:51.605 --> 07:54.138
Nikki:
Can you get the light
on your way out?

07:54.174 --> 07:55.406
Kristian:
Goodnight, you two.

07:57.244 --> 07:59.043
Mmm.

07:59.112 --> 08:02.647
Again, I can't stress enough
how sorry we are about this.

08:02.782 --> 08:04.715
Joy:
Just a crazy mix-up.

08:04.751 --> 08:07.786
Can't really point the finger
at any one person.

08:07.788 --> 08:09.354
You must've really missed
this little guy.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.122
Gal. But yes.

08:11.258 --> 08:12.790
It did help to know
she was in such great hands--

08:12.826 --> 08:14.826
But he's mine.

08:14.961 --> 08:17.696
I know how you feel,
but snowball belongs here.

08:17.698 --> 08:21.333
You won't go home empty-handed,
though. Right, joy?

08:21.468 --> 08:24.536
Look who wants to
go home with you.

08:24.605 --> 08:27.038
Shannon:
Uh, twinsies, meet baxter,

08:27.173 --> 08:29.674
The most lovable floof
in all of the land.

08:29.809 --> 08:32.143
If they're the same,
you keep him.

08:32.279 --> 08:33.545
(clearing throat)

08:35.082 --> 08:36.381
Sorry.

08:36.516 --> 08:38.516
Lucy is going through
a tough time.

08:38.585 --> 08:40.618
Puberty, right?
Wake me when it's over.

08:42.289 --> 08:43.421
(mrs. Rosario crying)

08:43.490 --> 08:45.490
I'm sorry.
Was it something I said?

08:45.625 --> 08:49.961
No. It's just, well, lucy is not
going to be around much longer.

08:50.030 --> 08:52.964
Mrs. Rosario:
The house will be so empty.

08:52.966 --> 08:55.967
And the thought of
saying goodbye--

08:56.036 --> 08:57.435
Mr. Rosario:
Hey. Like you said,

08:57.571 --> 08:59.838
There'll be time for tears
once she's gone.

08:59.973 --> 09:01.907
Of course lucy can keep
snowball.

09:02.042 --> 09:04.241
Right, shannon?

09:06.880 --> 09:09.614
Or you know who's even better
than snowball?

09:09.616 --> 09:11.649
This little guy.

09:11.685 --> 09:14.119
"hello. Meow.
I'm your new best friend.

09:14.121 --> 09:15.987
I want to go home with you."

09:19.026 --> 09:20.525
(baxter yelping, hissing)

09:20.660 --> 09:23.094
That's how
he says hello, so...

09:27.100 --> 09:29.134
Special delivery.

09:29.136 --> 09:31.069
Oh, my god. Thank you.
I'm dying here.

09:33.873 --> 09:35.040
I got you decaf.

09:35.042 --> 09:36.707
(gagging) why?

09:36.743 --> 09:38.476
I wasn't sure how much
caffeine you'd already had,

09:38.612 --> 09:41.012
And you shouldn't have
more than 200 milligrams a day

09:41.081 --> 09:42.480
Because of baby.

09:42.482 --> 09:44.282
Where'd you hear that?

09:44.284 --> 09:46.217
Uh, my gp is actually an ob,

09:46.286 --> 09:48.086
Which is not really okay
with either of us.

09:48.088 --> 09:49.754
Bit weird.

09:49.756 --> 09:51.189
I could whip you up
a matcha smoothie.

09:51.191 --> 09:52.690
Half the caffeine
and tastes like grass.

09:52.726 --> 09:55.026
Sorry.
I always oversell them.

09:55.062 --> 09:58.229
It's fine. I'll just keep
running on adrenaline.

09:58.231 --> 10:00.765
Ah. That's actually worse.
I'll get you a real coffee.

10:00.900 --> 10:03.234
You're a gem.
Need anything else?

10:03.236 --> 10:04.703
A cinnamon bun, warm.

10:04.838 --> 10:06.904
But a day old,
so the flav is peaking.

10:06.906 --> 10:09.207
Love it.
And I'm leaving an hour early.

10:09.209 --> 10:11.542
Oh. Uh yeah, that's fine. We got
a school group coming through.

10:11.578 --> 10:12.910
They can help
with the dogs.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.512
Although last time,

10:14.581 --> 10:16.180
One of the kids ate
all the dog food and threw up.

10:16.216 --> 10:18.049
Ugh.
So glad I don't have kids...

10:18.085 --> 10:19.517
Yet.

10:19.519 --> 10:21.686
Well, text me
if you need anything else.

10:21.821 --> 10:23.121
I got my phone on full volume,
just in case.

10:23.256 --> 10:26.123
Wow. Obsessed much?

10:26.159 --> 10:28.259
Um, if you have time,

10:28.295 --> 10:30.328
Maybe you could take a couple
of the dogs for a walk?

10:30.330 --> 10:31.997
Fresh air might do
the fetus some good.

10:32.132 --> 10:34.799
Or put crazy stress
on its unformed brain.

10:34.868 --> 10:37.736
Well, I mean, who knows
your body better than you do?

10:37.871 --> 10:40.405
Marko does.
Fair enough.

10:40.407 --> 10:43.074
Paul:
Hey. You got a minute?

10:43.110 --> 10:45.010
Oh, boss ross
at your ser-voss.

10:45.145 --> 10:46.744
Oh, my god. I'm putting
that on my business cards.

10:46.780 --> 10:48.747
What's up?

10:48.749 --> 10:52.350
Well, I just wanted to say how
much I enjoy working with you

10:52.485 --> 10:54.686
And what a pleasure it is
to come in every day.

10:54.688 --> 10:55.887
Aw. Thank you, paul.

10:55.956 --> 10:57.956
And I quit.
What?

10:58.091 --> 11:00.158
It's my resignation letter.
Also my grocery list.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.960
Actually, can I get that back
when you're done?

11:01.962 --> 11:04.095
I'm making
a pretty complicated stew.
Paul, no.

11:04.131 --> 11:06.765
I guess I can squeeze one more
night out of that frozen pizza.

11:06.767 --> 11:08.800
No, paul. You're not quitting.
What's going on?

11:08.935 --> 11:13.771
Well, the thing is,
I'm peaches.

11:13.807 --> 11:16.174
Okay. Let's move away from
the groceries.

11:16.176 --> 11:18.209
No. I mean, like, "get down on
the floor, you piece of crap!

11:18.344 --> 11:19.910
This is a robbery" peaches.

11:19.946 --> 11:22.714
Oh, my god.
L-- liam's peaches?

11:22.783 --> 11:24.382
Yeah.

11:24.517 --> 11:27.118
And things didn't go exactly
the way he said they went.

11:27.120 --> 11:29.520
It was less he attacks me
with a massager

11:29.589 --> 11:32.590
And more he rolls up
into a sobbing baby ball.

11:32.626 --> 11:34.459
And he doesn't know
it was you?

11:34.461 --> 11:36.694
Not yet, but he'll probably
figure it out when I tell him.

11:36.763 --> 11:39.531
Okay, but hear me out:

11:39.533 --> 11:41.066
What if
you don't tell him?

11:41.201 --> 11:43.001
Well, I'm not really
comfortable lying.

11:43.136 --> 11:45.803
That's what old paul would do.
I'm a different person now.

11:45.939 --> 11:47.872
Exactly. Fresh start, right?

11:47.874 --> 11:50.208
Is it really so wrong to do
what's best for yourself

11:50.343 --> 11:52.277
Even if it makes
a little girl cry?

11:52.412 --> 11:54.245
That's homophobia,
shannon.

11:54.380 --> 11:56.147
Liam's gay. Not a girl.

11:56.149 --> 11:59.150
My point is, that night,
did anybody get hurt?

11:59.219 --> 12:01.018
No, but--

12:01.054 --> 12:02.820
And liam even said
it was a million years ago.

12:02.856 --> 12:05.723
He's over it, and it's not like
you're still a thief.

12:05.726 --> 12:07.024
You're not still a thief,
are you?

12:07.060 --> 12:09.193
Absolutely not.
See?

12:09.229 --> 12:11.295
No point in dredging up
the past. Case closed.

12:11.364 --> 12:13.164
Court adjourned.
You can't handle the truth.

12:13.200 --> 12:15.833
Yeah.

12:15.902 --> 12:18.636
You're still going to
tell him, aren't you?

12:18.705 --> 12:20.972
Yeah, but that was
a really good speech.

12:20.974 --> 12:23.374
But it's the last week
of the Halloween haunt.

12:23.510 --> 12:25.777
No. I already got my
sexy hygienist costume.

12:25.846 --> 12:28.513
No. I'm not going
to wonderland alone.

12:28.582 --> 12:30.515
You said
we would do this together.

12:30.517 --> 12:32.250
I know
it's a roller-coaster ride,

12:32.385 --> 12:33.684
But you can't back out now.

12:33.754 --> 12:36.120
No. Don't you dare put me
on hold, marko!

12:36.189 --> 12:38.790
Ugh. He knows how important
this is to me.

12:38.925 --> 12:40.124
Uh--

12:40.193 --> 12:43.394
Anyway, f it.

12:43.396 --> 12:45.296
Look.
Maybe it's none of my business,

12:45.431 --> 12:47.198
But you deserve better.

12:47.267 --> 12:51.469
You are creating
another human.

12:51.538 --> 12:54.872
You are like an earth goddess,
glowing with life

12:54.941 --> 12:57.242
And potential and shinier hair.

12:57.244 --> 12:59.009
<i> Yo, you still there?</i>
<i> You there, nikki?</i>

12:59.045 --> 13:01.679
Yeah.
And you know what?

13:01.681 --> 13:03.648
Kristian's right.
I am a goddess.

13:03.717 --> 13:06.351
And my hair is looking
straight wicked right now.

13:06.486 --> 13:09.420
So, if you're not going to
respect me, then lose my number.

13:09.489 --> 13:12.590
(chuckles)
wow.

13:12.659 --> 13:15.493
That was cool.

13:15.628 --> 13:19.631
Yeah, well, no one's ever--
anyway, thanks.

13:19.766 --> 13:21.366
There's that
extra estrogen.

13:21.501 --> 13:23.568
Mm-hmm.

13:23.703 --> 13:27.172
♪ I want to go on
an adventure ♪

13:27.307 --> 13:30.474
♪ take me, I just want... ♪

13:32.979 --> 13:34.112
Yoo-hoo?

13:34.247 --> 13:36.447
Oh, aunt peggy.
Ah, hi, dear.

13:36.516 --> 13:38.449
Nikki and I are hitting the mall
to have our colours done.

13:38.485 --> 13:40.051
Oh.
Nikki:
You should come.

13:40.186 --> 13:42.052
You're doing your face
really wrong.

13:42.088 --> 13:43.921
I would,
but I have to get snowball home.

13:43.957 --> 13:45.523
I made her egg, liver
and psyllium pâté,

13:45.658 --> 13:47.658
But she's still not eating.

13:47.727 --> 13:48.993
Does she seem off to you?

13:49.128 --> 13:50.394
Nikki:
Well, someone does.

13:50.463 --> 13:52.130
Don't tease.
Moms worry.

13:52.265 --> 13:53.464
You'll know what it's like
one day,

13:53.600 --> 13:55.400
When you're a... Aunt.

13:55.535 --> 13:57.068
I could be a mom.

13:57.137 --> 13:59.070
You know, some people
think I'd be a great mom.

13:59.205 --> 14:01.405
Seriously? I know that sounded
more skeptical than affirming,

14:01.441 --> 14:02.740
But it wasn't.

14:02.876 --> 14:04.408
Snowball's probably
just embarrassed.

14:04.444 --> 14:06.678
Dogs sense fear. Cats sense
social humiliation.

14:06.680 --> 14:08.213
Peggy:
What happened?

14:08.348 --> 14:10.147
Shannon crushed the dreams
of a make-a-wish kid.

14:10.149 --> 14:11.749
Okay. That's not true.

14:11.818 --> 14:13.484
Well, from what joy said,
the kid was head over heels

14:13.553 --> 14:14.952
For snowball
and you wouldn't give her up.

14:15.021 --> 14:16.354
Well, snowball is like my kid.

14:16.423 --> 14:17.822
Who would just give away their
kid?

14:17.824 --> 14:19.691
Well, your parents,
for one.
Nikki--

14:19.826 --> 14:21.559
She does make a point.

14:21.694 --> 14:24.362
So, you would just
give nikki away?

14:24.497 --> 14:25.830
No.

14:27.968 --> 14:32.236
There comes a time
in every girl's life

14:32.305 --> 14:36.173
Where she has to make
a tough decision.

14:36.209 --> 14:38.976
And this is yours.

14:39.045 --> 14:42.179
See?
Total mom material.

14:43.617 --> 14:44.916
♪ red hot ♪

14:44.918 --> 14:49.520

14:49.522 --> 14:51.588

14:55.729 --> 14:57.629
Kristian:
Sorry about the chemical smell.

14:57.764 --> 15:00.531
I know the other day my musk
was a little intense.

15:00.533 --> 15:02.533
It's okay. I can handle it.

15:04.103 --> 15:06.871
I read that your sensitivities
can vary wildly.

15:06.873 --> 15:09.674
What you hate one day,
you want the next.

15:09.743 --> 15:12.543
Uh-huh.
Stupid baby hormones, right?

15:12.679 --> 15:14.278
Oh, and I left some antacids
on your desk

15:14.347 --> 15:15.813
To help with the nausea.

15:15.849 --> 15:20.217
Oh, thanks.
That's sweet, or whatever.

15:20.287 --> 15:23.287
So... S'up?

15:23.323 --> 15:26.758
Oh, you're dirty here.

15:26.760 --> 15:27.926
Marko:
Nikki?

15:28.061 --> 15:30.394
Oh, no-no-no bueno.
No bueno.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.630
Don't speak fake spanish.
No one here is impressed.

15:32.632 --> 15:35.366
Why are you ghosting my texts?
Why do you think?

15:35.435 --> 15:37.568
Baby, you're seriously going to
ride the log flume without me?

15:37.570 --> 15:39.270
Not to be prescriptive,

15:39.272 --> 15:41.105
But you should probably avoid
all rides right now.

15:41.107 --> 15:45.710
Yeah, except that d-train
last Friday, right? Toot-toot!

15:45.779 --> 15:47.311
I thought you had birthing class
last Friday.

15:47.313 --> 15:49.847
Yeah. I, uh--
birthing class?

15:49.916 --> 15:52.717
Oh, my god. Did the d-train
make it to the station?

15:52.719 --> 15:54.752
No, no.
I'm not pregnant.

15:54.788 --> 15:57.721
I thought I was.
No, that's not true.

15:57.757 --> 16:00.124
Look. Kristian thought I was,
and I just went with it,

16:00.160 --> 16:03.194
Because it was nice
to feel cared for for once.

16:03.196 --> 16:05.530
God, I am such an idiot.
No, you're not.

16:05.665 --> 16:08.198
Marko:
Look. I'm sorry that
you thought I didn't care.

16:08.234 --> 16:10.268
Between clocking hours
at tech city, dj'ing,

16:10.403 --> 16:12.803
Part-time landscapery,
I got a full bowl.

16:12.839 --> 16:14.872
I just wanted to go
to wonderland.

16:15.008 --> 16:16.407
Yeah, and I want to take you.

16:16.542 --> 16:18.876
(chuckling)

16:19.012 --> 16:21.212
But I have to finish
my shift first, so...

16:21.214 --> 16:22.480
Text you later.

16:22.549 --> 16:23.981
As you wish, señorita.

16:23.984 --> 16:26.350
(giggling)

16:26.386 --> 16:27.885
Peace.

16:30.523 --> 16:32.023
Ah. Sorry about that.

16:32.092 --> 16:34.759
You got to teach people
how to treat you, I guess.

16:34.828 --> 16:38.095
Hey, I really sucked
this week.

16:38.131 --> 16:41.098
And even though most of it
was based in lies,

16:41.167 --> 16:44.302
I really appreciated
your friendship.

16:44.304 --> 16:47.438
So, I hope we can still be cool,
or something.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.574
It'll probably be "or something"
for a little bit.

16:51.544 --> 16:54.445
You looked really good cleaning
those cages.

16:55.848 --> 16:56.848
Thanks.

16:56.850 --> 16:58.382
So, is it just me,

16:58.451 --> 17:00.284
Or did me, you and marko
have threesome energy?

17:00.286 --> 17:01.786
I'm going to leave now.

17:01.788 --> 17:03.320
You felt it.

17:05.525 --> 17:07.391
Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

17:07.460 --> 17:08.826
You said it was urgent.

17:08.862 --> 17:10.361
It's just that after

17:10.363 --> 17:13.597
A lot of journaling
and soul-searching

17:13.633 --> 17:17.134
And a few tears,
I want lucy to have snowball.

17:17.170 --> 17:19.670
Really?

17:19.672 --> 17:22.606
I saw how happy she made you,
and that made me happy.

17:22.642 --> 17:24.341
Ugh!

17:24.411 --> 17:26.810
It's okay, honey.
Baxter purrs before he strikes.

17:26.846 --> 17:28.612
Are you sure?

17:28.648 --> 17:30.281
I mean, of course
I'll miss her.

17:30.350 --> 17:32.750
In some ways,
snowball is my best friend.

17:32.819 --> 17:34.552
Well, if you're willing to
just give her up, I mean--

17:34.554 --> 17:36.220
Okay. You take that back.

17:36.222 --> 17:40.424
I mean, true friendship
is giving that friend away

17:40.427 --> 17:42.759
To a new friend, if it makes
that friend smile.

17:42.796 --> 17:44.628
The new one,
not the traded one,

17:44.697 --> 17:46.630
Who'll probably miss
the original friend very badly.

17:46.666 --> 17:48.366
I told you not to answer
the phone.

17:48.368 --> 17:52.236
It's very sweet of you,
but I don't think we can handle

17:52.238 --> 17:54.171
Two cats after lucy is gone.

17:54.240 --> 17:57.107
Yeah. And it's not like lucy
can take snowball with her.

17:57.143 --> 18:02.113
Wow. Can I just say
you two are amazing parents?

18:02.115 --> 18:05.650
I would be a mess
if I was you.

18:05.652 --> 18:08.051
Oh, I will be
once she's gone.

18:08.088 --> 18:09.386
But it's only three weeks.

18:09.456 --> 18:11.188
Three weeks? Oh, my god.

18:11.224 --> 18:13.925
No. I meant lucy's going to be
gone for three weeks.

18:14.060 --> 18:15.793
"only" three weeks?

18:15.928 --> 18:18.496
Our baby is going
to sleep-away camp.

18:18.565 --> 18:19.796
It is a very big deal.

18:19.833 --> 18:22.934
Camp? Oh, my god.
Yay. So fun.

18:23.069 --> 18:24.535
I mean, I hope so.

18:24.571 --> 18:26.337
It's a camp for kids
with cancer.

18:26.472 --> 18:29.873
Oh. So, lucy has cancer?

18:29.909 --> 18:31.275
No. She's a
counsellor-in-training.

18:31.311 --> 18:33.177
The kids love her.

18:33.179 --> 18:34.946
Yeah, of course they do.
What's not to love?

18:35.081 --> 18:36.547
We really
think it's because

18:36.583 --> 18:38.149
She understands
what they're going through.

18:38.151 --> 18:39.816
She's a cancer survivor herself.

18:39.853 --> 18:41.685
Four years healthy.

18:41.754 --> 18:43.387
Knock on wood.

18:43.389 --> 18:45.055
(phone ringing
in the background)

18:45.125 --> 18:46.691
I am so sorry.

18:46.826 --> 18:48.693
I feel so bad for you,
for lucy,

18:48.828 --> 18:50.828
For all those kids
and a little bit for myself.

18:50.830 --> 18:52.496
But if I'm being honest,

18:52.499 --> 18:54.765
I don't think I can give up
snowball.

18:54.767 --> 18:57.101
Does that make me
a terrible person?

18:57.103 --> 18:59.036
Maybe.
We don't really know you.

18:59.172 --> 19:01.238
Mrs. Rosario:
Lucy, dear, we're going to
give snowball back.

19:01.274 --> 19:03.507
We should get going.

19:03.576 --> 19:06.177
We have to go get lucy
a new sleeping bag

19:06.179 --> 19:08.579
Because baxter clawed through
the other one.

19:08.648 --> 19:10.014
Such a character.

19:10.149 --> 19:13.184
Ah. Baxter.
Hey, buddy. Welcome back.

19:13.319 --> 19:14.985
Joy, this is snowball.

19:19.325 --> 19:21.525
(knocking on door)

19:23.263 --> 19:25.930
Whoa. Is this a shakedown,
ross?

19:25.932 --> 19:27.632
You're already getting
your place at cost.

19:27.634 --> 19:29.600
Paul has something
he would like to tell you.

19:29.669 --> 19:31.102
Okay.

19:31.104 --> 19:34.405
Well, um, years ago,
there was an incident

19:34.407 --> 19:37.008
That involved me
and you.

19:37.143 --> 19:38.676
Man. This is harder
than I thought.

19:38.811 --> 19:40.077
You're doing great.

19:40.146 --> 19:41.479
You know,
I had just broken up

19:41.481 --> 19:42.947
With my girlfriend
at the time, and--

19:43.016 --> 19:45.783
He's peaches. The guy
who robbed you years ago.

19:45.852 --> 19:47.618
Oh. Wow.

19:47.687 --> 19:49.754
And I'm very sorry.

19:49.889 --> 19:51.756
Okay.
Yeah.

19:51.891 --> 19:54.358
I feel especially bad, because
I know how much I terrified you.

19:54.493 --> 19:56.827
I wasn't terrified.

19:56.963 --> 19:58.429
I can still hear your screams
echoing in my head:

19:58.498 --> 20:00.030
"help me, please,
mommy!"

20:00.099 --> 20:03.367
Probably my boyfriend.
Now,<i> he</i> was scared.

20:03.502 --> 20:05.168
I was?

20:05.205 --> 20:06.904
When?
Nothing, hon.

20:06.973 --> 20:09.106
Well, we should probably get
back to unpacking our groceries

20:09.142 --> 20:10.708
Before the crème fraîche
becomes crème stale.

20:10.710 --> 20:13.577
Paul would also like to read
you and hugh

20:13.580 --> 20:14.979
A perpetrator
impact statement.

20:15.114 --> 20:17.915
I, paul como,
hereby acknowledge

20:17.984 --> 20:20.384
That my behaviour
affected you

20:20.386 --> 20:23.187
In the following ways:
I scared you both.

20:23.322 --> 20:25.789
I made hugh snot-cry
like a baby.

20:25.825 --> 20:28.659
Sorry, when? What?
Funny story.

20:28.695 --> 20:30.594
When you and I started dating,
remember I got robbed?

20:30.663 --> 20:32.195
Mm-hmm.

20:32.232 --> 20:34.398
Well, paul was one of
the robbers.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.801
Oh.
Yeah.

20:36.803 --> 20:38.936
Now that I think of it, hugh
was out of town that weekend,

20:39.005 --> 20:40.404
So, yes, he was snot-crying
at a wedding.

20:40.539 --> 20:41.805
Anyhoo, water under
the bridge.

20:41.874 --> 20:43.474
Okay. Well--

20:43.609 --> 20:45.610
Yeah. It's just I heard you up
in the bedroom, wailing.

20:45.745 --> 20:47.478
Right.

20:47.613 --> 20:51.348
I was watching kristen bell
crying over that sloth. Hmm.

20:51.417 --> 20:54.351
Girl, take a page out of
your own book and let it go.

20:54.420 --> 20:56.020
But why would kristen bell
be yelling,

20:56.022 --> 20:57.688
"please don't kill my lee-lee,
my one true love"?

20:57.724 --> 20:59.356
Oh, my god. It was daniel.

20:59.392 --> 21:01.224
Who's daniel?
My ex.

21:01.261 --> 21:04.095
Who came by totally platonically
to get his stuff and propose.

21:04.230 --> 21:05.963
Paul: Wow.
I said no.

21:06.032 --> 21:08.566
I guess I should apologize
to this daniel guy, too, now?

21:08.568 --> 21:11.835
Yeah. Well, get the number off
liam. I'm sure he still has it.

21:11.904 --> 21:14.372
Oh, my god--
he's a great electrician.

21:14.507 --> 21:16.240
Contractors are my bread
and butter. Right, ross?

21:16.375 --> 21:17.974
We should go.
I don't want to intrude.

21:18.011 --> 21:20.311
To think I almost told
my parents about you.

21:20.313 --> 21:21.578
You haven't told
your parents?

21:21.614 --> 21:22.846
