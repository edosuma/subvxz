<i>Air and naval forces
of the United States</i>

00:08.633 --> 00:11.568
<i>launched a series of strikes
against terrorist facilities...</i>

00:11.603 --> 00:14.123
<i>Pan Am Flight 103 crashed
into the town of Lockerbie.</i>

00:14.157 --> 00:15.757
<i>He has sanctioned acts of terror</i>

00:15.758 --> 00:17.158
<i>in Africa, Europe, the Middle East.</i>

00:17.159 --> 00:18.799
<i>This will not stand,</i>

00:18.800 --> 00:20.442
<i>this aggression against Kuwait.</i>

00:20.443 --> 00:22.123
<i>This relentless pursuit of terror.</i>

00:22.124 --> 00:24.364
<i>We will make no distinction...</i>

00:24.365 --> 00:25.765
<i>The USS</i> Cole <i>was attacked</i>

00:25.766 --> 00:27.206
<i>while refueling in the port of Aden.</i>

00:27.207 --> 00:28.381
This was an act of terrorism.

00:28.415 --> 00:30.863
It was a despicable and cowardly act.

00:30.897 --> 00:33.008
<i>The next samba we're
going to swing for you</i>

00:33.009 --> 00:34.329
is one of the good old favorites.

00:34.363 --> 00:36.941
Until something stops him.

00:36.975 --> 00:39.740
<i>I'm just making sure we
don't get hit again.</i>

00:39.775 --> 00:43.299
<i>That plane crashed into
the World Trade Center.</i>

00:44.664 --> 00:46.928
<i>Thousands of people running.</i>

00:46.951 --> 00:50.611
We must and we will remain
vigilant at home and abroad.

00:57.226 --> 00:59.694
<i>What the fuck are you doing?</i>

00:59.728 --> 01:01.695
<i>Fuck!</i>

01:01.730 --> 01:03.697
<i>I missed something once before.</i>

01:03.731 --> 01:06.501
<i>I won't... I</i> can't <i>let
that happen again.</i>

01:07.770 --> 01:09.903
<i>It was ten years ago.</i>

01:09.938 --> 01:11.605
<i>Everyone missed something that day.</i>

01:11.640 --> 01:13.607
<i>Everyone's not me.</i>

<i>Previously on</i> Homeland...

01:31.792 --> 01:33.125
What did you say?

01:33.159 --> 01:34.659
I'm an American.

01:34.693 --> 01:36.493
It turns out he's one of ours.

01:36.528 --> 01:39.096
Marine Sergeant Nicholas Brody,

01:39.130 --> 01:41.998
MIA since early 2003
and presumed dead...

01:42.033 --> 01:43.333
until now.

01:44.435 --> 01:46.769
Hi, Dad.

01:46.803 --> 01:49.138
Did you ever meet him? - Abu Nazir?

01:49.172 --> 01:51.332
Was he ever present during
any of your interrogations?

01:51.333 --> 01:52.274
No.

01:52.309 --> 01:53.943
So Abu Nazir's resurfacing

01:53.977 --> 01:56.345
just as Brody's miraculously
returned home means nothing?

02:01.685 --> 02:03.671
Dad...

02:03.672 --> 02:05.712
<i>If he is a terrorist, we
need eyes an ears on Brody</i>

02:05.713 --> 02:08.026
<i>from the minute he steps off that plane.</i>

02:08.060 --> 02:10.527
I'm sorry. - Hey, I know you.

02:10.562 --> 02:13.202
Hey, look, I'm not going back in
if it means you can't go back in.

02:13.203 --> 02:14.084
That's not necessary.

02:14.085 --> 02:15.725
Maybe we can hold our
own private meeting

02:15.726 --> 02:16.806
out here. How's that sound?

02:16.807 --> 02:19.639
It's tempting.

02:22.210 --> 02:23.343
How about your wife?

02:23.378 --> 02:25.279
I can't be with her,

02:25.313 --> 02:27.014
<i>but I can with you.</i>

02:27.048 --> 02:29.684
The fucking CIA thinks I'm
working for Al-Qaeda?

02:29.718 --> 02:32.186
I think you're working for Al-Qaeda.

02:32.221 --> 02:35.690
I was broken, living
in the dark for years,

02:35.724 --> 02:36.991
and a man walked in.

02:39.529 --> 02:41.697
<i>And he was kind to me.</i>

02:41.731 --> 02:43.466
And you became his follower?

02:43.500 --> 02:45.235
<i>For the last time, Carrie,</i>

02:45.269 --> 02:47.171
<i>I am not what you think I am.</i>

02:47.205 --> 02:48.973
<i>I pray every day</i>

02:49.007 --> 02:51.208
<i>that you never lose sight
of what you committed</i>

02:51.243 --> 02:53.311
<i>to do in Issa's name.</i>

02:53.345 --> 02:55.146
<i>The switch is here.</i>

02:55.181 --> 02:57.148
<i>Wait until the last second
before you open it.</i>

02:57.183 --> 02:59.518
<i>I read that part of
the blast goes upward</i>

02:59.552 --> 03:02.888
toward here... point of weakness.

03:02.923 --> 03:04.991
There is a bigger, pernicious,

03:05.025 --> 03:06.692
Abu Nazir-worthy plot out there,

03:06.727 --> 03:08.194
and we have little time.

03:08.228 --> 03:09.662
We have to code it, collide it,

03:09.696 --> 03:11.397
collapse it, contain it.

03:11.432 --> 03:12.999
<i>She's bipolar.</i>

03:13.033 --> 03:14.734
<i>She's stable on her meds.</i>

03:14.768 --> 03:16.069
Why didn't she ever tell me?

03:16.104 --> 03:17.504
She said no one at work could know.

03:17.539 --> 03:19.619
Your office at Langley is
being cleared as we speak.

03:19.641 --> 03:22.109
I am about to solve this fucking thing.

03:24.046 --> 03:26.006
- What are you doing here?
- It's about your dad.

03:26.007 --> 03:26.631
Was he hit?

03:26.632 --> 03:28.872
He is with the vice president
and other innocent people.

03:28.873 --> 03:30.753
He is going to kill them
if we don't stop them.

03:30.787 --> 03:33.107
Okay, the world is about to end
and we're standing around,

03:33.108 --> 03:34.123
talking!

03:34.157 --> 03:35.458
Do not move.

03:40.164 --> 03:42.065
Saul, you have to listen to me.

03:42.067 --> 03:43.987
The woman that was hit...
she is not the target.

03:43.997 --> 03:45.757
<i>Right now they're putting
the vice president</i>

03:45.758 --> 03:47.238
<i>and his team in a single small space.</i>

03:47.239 --> 03:49.239
<i>They're supposed to be safe
there but they're not.</i>

03:49.274 --> 03:50.241
<i>They're vulnerable.</i>

03:50.275 --> 03:51.976
Say the holy words.

03:52.010 --> 03:52.877
<i>Remember Issa.</i>

03:52.911 --> 03:54.111
Got a call for you

03:54.146 --> 03:55.112
from your daughter.

03:55.147 --> 03:57.248
Dana, I got to call you back.

03:57.283 --> 03:59.403
No, Dad, no, there was this
crazy woman at our house.

03:59.404 --> 04:01.086
Dad, she said that you're a terrorist.

04:01.120 --> 04:05.223
You have to promise me that
you're coming home, Dad.

04:05.258 --> 04:07.425
I'm coming home, Dana.

04:08.928 --> 04:10.762
I know about your condition.

04:10.796 --> 04:13.632
You need to get some help.

04:13.666 --> 04:15.167
I am.

04:15.201 --> 04:17.569
And you need to stay away from me.

04:17.603 --> 04:20.339
Good-bye, Brody.

04:20.373 --> 04:21.613
I can't live like this anymore.

04:21.613 --> 04:23.075
It needs to stop.

04:23.110 --> 04:25.678
What about the side effects...
memory loss?

04:25.712 --> 04:27.617
Saul, I've made up my mind.

04:48.767 --> 04:50.487
Countering criticism

04:50.488 --> 04:51.808
from the international community,

04:51.809 --> 04:53.910
the Israeli government
continues to defend

04:53.944 --> 04:57.583
its successful bombing of five
Iranian nuclear facilities.

04:57.617 --> 05:00.586
Demonstrators held protests
outside of U.S. embassies

05:00.620 --> 05:04.223
over the American government's
support of Israel.

05:04.258 --> 05:05.298
I told you to turn it off.

05:05.299 --> 05:07.026
IDF spokesman Yigal Nitzani called

05:07.061 --> 05:10.038
Iran's claim of 3,000 casualties
"a gross exaggeration

05:10.039 --> 05:11.599
meant to stir international outrage..."

05:11.600 --> 05:12.833
Dad.

05:12.867 --> 05:14.334
"...against Israel in its..."

05:16.704 --> 05:19.372
It's not like she doesn't know
what's going on over there.

05:19.407 --> 05:21.074
Of course she does.

05:21.109 --> 05:23.010
But why wave it in her face?

05:23.044 --> 05:26.081
I mean, she's finally
gotten to a good place.

05:26.115 --> 05:27.749
Depends how you define good.

05:27.783 --> 05:29.184
What do you mean?

05:29.218 --> 05:31.053
I think her lithium levels are too high.

05:31.087 --> 05:33.089
That is for her and
Dr. Rosenberg to decide.

05:33.123 --> 05:34.757
When mine were too high, I couldn't read

05:34.791 --> 05:36.025
for six months.

05:36.059 --> 05:37.499
Stay out of it. - Puttering around

05:37.500 --> 05:39.500
in that stupid garden like
your mother used to do.

05:40.764 --> 05:42.431
Morning, guys.

05:42.466 --> 05:44.434
Hey, want some pancakes? - No, thanks.

05:44.468 --> 05:45.769
You sure? - Yeah, I've got

05:45.803 --> 05:47.471
a bunch of exams to grade before class,

05:47.505 --> 05:49.740
and, Dad, you can turn
the TV back on now.

05:50.775 --> 05:51.942
What did I tell you?

07:09.721 --> 07:12.423
You said a woman gave
this to our cutout.

07:12.891 --> 07:14.491
You didn't say who.

07:14.525 --> 07:16.205
That's the thing, sir, we don't know.

07:16.206 --> 07:17.486
What do you mean you don't know?

07:17.487 --> 07:20.130
She contacted us with a
priority three code...

07:20.165 --> 07:22.045
intelligence about an attack on U.S.
interests.

07:22.066 --> 07:24.000
Someone in this station
must be running her.

07:24.035 --> 07:26.636
Except no one has any idea who she is.

07:26.670 --> 07:27.670
We were hoping you might.

07:27.671 --> 07:28.805
Let me show you.

07:36.747 --> 07:38.715
I've never seen her before.

07:38.750 --> 07:41.190
Well, she wants a face-to-face
at one of our designated

07:41.191 --> 07:42.019
dead drops.

07:42.053 --> 07:44.054
When? - In two hours.

07:53.465 --> 07:55.199
Get the car ready.

07:55.233 --> 07:56.567
You're gonna drop me outside.

07:56.601 --> 07:58.869
Sir, the last unconfirmed
asset we trusted

07:58.903 --> 08:00.737
blew himself up with
five of our officers.

08:00.772 --> 08:03.707
Shouldn't we work our sources,

08:03.741 --> 08:05.575
- find out who she is first?
- Two days ago

08:05.610 --> 08:08.845
Israel bombed five nuclear
sites deep inside Iran.

08:08.880 --> 08:10.948
Ayatollahs are not amused.
They have climbed

08:10.982 --> 08:13.750
into their minbars, vowed to
retaliate against the West.

08:13.784 --> 08:15.224
You're saying it's not a coincidence

08:15.225 --> 08:16.553
this woman comes forward now.

08:16.587 --> 08:18.722
I'm saying it's not a
coincidence we can ignore.

08:20.558 --> 08:22.559
I'll get the car.

09:13.542 --> 09:15.109
I think we got company.

09:18.681 --> 09:21.315
You'd think they'd at least
change out their follow car.

11:14.762 --> 11:17.263
Why are you running away?

11:17.297 --> 11:19.532
I came here 'cause you wanted to talk.

11:19.566 --> 11:21.467
You are confusing me with someone else.

11:21.501 --> 11:23.069
I don't think so.

11:25.172 --> 11:29.141
You said you had information
about an attack.

11:32.412 --> 11:33.980
No, Aaron, that's not what I'm saying.

11:34.014 --> 11:36.649
I've just been trying to get
some sort of conformation.

11:36.684 --> 11:38.117
Well, get him on the phone.

11:38.152 --> 11:39.652
Sir.

11:39.686 --> 11:40.820
Morning, Betsy.

11:42.589 --> 11:43.555
Who?

11:43.589 --> 11:44.909
The Vice President.

11:50.930 --> 11:51.997
Mr. Vice President.

11:53.032 --> 11:54.099
Congressman.

11:58.805 --> 12:01.173
I understand the wives are
becoming fast friends.

12:01.207 --> 12:02.942
Mrs. Walden's been great, sir.

12:02.976 --> 12:04.844
Getting Dana and Chris into school,

12:04.878 --> 12:06.179
helping with their scholarships.

12:06.213 --> 12:07.613
Well, that's what Cynthia does.

12:07.648 --> 12:08.681
Now it's our turn.

12:08.715 --> 12:10.083
Sir?

12:10.117 --> 12:11.918
Build some mutual trust.

12:15.055 --> 12:16.463
Within the hour,

12:16.464 --> 12:18.024
my campaign is going to float your name

12:18.058 --> 12:22.828
as a potential running
mate on the ticket.

12:24.298 --> 12:26.132
Assuming you're interested, of course.

12:26.167 --> 12:27.200
Are you're serious?

12:27.234 --> 12:28.768
This is for real?

12:28.803 --> 12:30.671
We've got a long way to
go to the convention,

12:30.705 --> 12:32.105
and there's other hats in the ring,

12:32.140 --> 12:35.809
but I believe you're the
future of the party.

12:37.345 --> 12:40.114
So I'll ask you again.
Are you interested?

12:40.148 --> 12:41.715
Hell, yes.

12:41.750 --> 12:43.790
That's the answer I was
looking for the first time!

12:43.791 --> 12:45.386
Understood, sir. Thank you.

12:47.322 --> 12:48.790
There is one other thing.

12:48.824 --> 12:52.360
I had you vetted by my search committee,

12:52.394 --> 12:55.129
background checked by the FBI.

12:55.163 --> 12:57.298
Turned you inside out.

13:02.037 --> 13:03.937
What did we miss, Nick?

13:05.607 --> 13:07.767
What flaw in your character,
what deep abiding secret?

13:07.768 --> 13:10.411
I need to know. I need to know now.

13:11.914 --> 13:13.914
I've been in a Taliban hole,
sir, for eight years.

13:13.915 --> 13:15.683
I didn't get much of a
chance to misbehave.

13:15.718 --> 13:18.353
Fair enough, but here's what
people are gonna say about that.

13:18.387 --> 13:21.189
You were a prisoner a long time.
Too long.

13:21.224 --> 13:23.291
You're damaged goods.

13:26.362 --> 13:29.598
You really want me to respond to that?

13:31.100 --> 13:32.868
You can hit a curveball. That's good.

13:35.805 --> 13:38.907
Expect my office to send
over a preliminary schedule.

13:38.942 --> 13:40.375
First up are the Sunday talk shows.

13:40.410 --> 13:42.711
I'm also arranging an
intelligence briefing.

13:42.745 --> 13:44.625
I want you prepped for
the inevitable questions

13:44.626 --> 13:46.066
about the crisis in the Middle East.

13:46.067 --> 13:47.016
I appreciate that, sir.

13:47.051 --> 13:48.585
And good luck.

13:57.996 --> 14:00.131
Nice work, Hana. - Thank you.

14:00.165 --> 14:02.233
You, too, Hakem.

14:02.268 --> 14:04.369
Almost perfect, Omar.

14:04.404 --> 14:06.071
Watch out for the extra pronoun, though.

14:06.105 --> 14:08.345
It's not: "Those are the
sunglasses I want to buy them."

14:08.346 --> 14:10.542
It's: "Those are the
sunglasses I want to buy."

14:10.577 --> 14:13.245
Those are the sunglasses I want to buy.

14:13.279 --> 14:14.246
Good.

14:20.753 --> 14:24.089
I'll be right back.

14:24.123 --> 14:26.424
Excuse me.

14:32.031 --> 14:32.930
What do you want?

14:32.965 --> 14:33.965
How are you, Carrie?

14:33.999 --> 14:35.666
I'm fine.

14:35.701 --> 14:37.581
Hey, I'm sorry I never
stopped by the hospital.

14:37.582 --> 14:38.302
I always meant to.

14:38.303 --> 14:39.271
Don't worry about it.

14:39.305 --> 14:41.140
I wasn't exactly having a party.

14:41.174 --> 14:42.908
What do you want?

14:42.942 --> 14:44.809
Estes needs to see you.

14:44.843 --> 14:47.077
Tell him to fuck off.

14:47.111 --> 14:49.145
Don't you even want to
know what this is about?

14:49.180 --> 14:50.113
No.

14:50.147 --> 14:51.181
Come on, Carrie.

14:51.215 --> 14:53.617
What am I supposed to tell him?

14:54.652 --> 14:56.252
Tell him he was right.

14:56.287 --> 14:59.155
Tell him I never belonged
in CIA in the first place.

15:06.898 --> 15:09.066
Sorry, everybody.

15:09.801 --> 15:11.434
Yes, Omar?

15:13.704 --> 15:16.272
He wasn't anybody.

15:18.708 --> 15:20.143
He's on the short list.

15:20.177 --> 15:22.345
That's all we really know right now.

15:22.380 --> 15:24.214
Senator Laughton, I think?

15:24.248 --> 15:26.683
No, no, I mean, it's all good.

15:26.717 --> 15:30.053
We're just in a complete
state of shock over here.

15:30.087 --> 15:33.289
Listen, Jean, I have to go,
but thanks for calling,

15:33.323 --> 15:35.357
and please thank Martin. Bye.

15:37.727 --> 15:39.862
The phone has been ringing all day.

15:39.896 --> 15:42.096
You would not believe who's
coming out of the woodwork.

15:42.131 --> 15:43.851
Guess how many friend
requests I got today?

15:43.852 --> 15:44.212
How many?

15:44.213 --> 15:45.134
Three hundred.

15:45.168 --> 15:46.402
That's a lot of friends.

15:46.436 --> 15:48.504
Chris, please tell Dana
that your father's home.

15:48.539 --> 15:49.872
Dana!

15:49.907 --> 15:51.707
And please don't yell. Just go get her.

15:51.742 --> 15:53.042
My God, Brody,

15:53.077 --> 15:55.679
Vice President of the United States?

15:55.713 --> 15:58.081
Let's not get carried away.

15:58.115 --> 15:59.649
Walden's just floating my name.

15:59.683 --> 16:01.403
They said you didn't
have enough experience

16:01.404 --> 16:02.524
to be Walden's running mate.

16:02.525 --> 16:04.154
I don't.

16:04.188 --> 16:06.823
I think he's just using my
name to help sell the public

16:06.857 --> 16:08.725
on taking a harder line with Iran.

16:08.759 --> 16:12.896
Still, just the fact that he's
mentioning your name in public.

16:12.930 --> 16:14.197
That's pretty incredible.

16:14.231 --> 16:15.932
Well.

16:15.966 --> 16:17.446
After everything you've been through.

16:17.468 --> 16:19.102
Everything we've all been through.

16:19.137 --> 16:20.871
Hey,

16:20.905 --> 16:22.105
you sure you want this?

16:22.139 --> 16:24.107
You know, being a member
of Congress is...

16:24.141 --> 16:26.375
It wouldn't be easy on the family.

16:26.410 --> 16:29.512
I get that, but I'd be lying

16:29.546 --> 16:32.348
if I said this hasn't been fun.

16:32.382 --> 16:34.750
I'll be back in, like, an hour.

16:36.219 --> 16:39.388
Do you have anything you
want to say to your father?

16:39.422 --> 16:41.756
Congratulations.

16:41.791 --> 16:43.191
Thank you.

16:43.225 --> 16:44.292
Where are you going?

16:44.326 --> 16:46.227
- Dinner.
- With who?

16:46.262 --> 16:47.462
Xander.

16:47.496 --> 16:49.130
Can you speak up, please?

16:49.165 --> 16:50.565
Xander.

16:50.599 --> 16:53.936
How come you never go out with
friends from your new school?

16:53.970 --> 16:56.038
Because I don't have any
friends at my new school.

16:56.072 --> 16:57.673
Are you done interrogating me?

17:01.845 --> 17:02.978
It's okay.

17:03.012 --> 17:05.814
Her attitude sucks.

17:05.848 --> 17:06.915
Yeah, she's 16.

17:06.950 --> 17:07.983
When I was 16,

17:08.017 --> 17:09.117
I was working two jobs,

17:09.152 --> 17:10.986
saving money for junior college.

17:11.020 --> 17:13.922
Yeah? I was repeating my
sophomore year in high school.

17:13.955 --> 17:15.057
You were, weren't you?

17:15.090 --> 17:16.759
Yeah.

17:47.023 --> 17:48.757
Carrie, where have you been?

17:48.791 --> 17:51.092
I've been trying you and trying you.

17:51.126 --> 17:52.646
How come you didn't answer your phone?

17:52.662 --> 17:54.129
I turned it off.

17:55.565 --> 17:57.766
Saul Berenson's been
calling all afternoon.

17:57.800 --> 18:00.202
Did he say what he wanted?

18:00.236 --> 18:01.637
No.

18:01.671 --> 18:03.672
Just that it's important
he speak to you.

18:08.711 --> 18:10.045
Hello?

18:10.080 --> 18:11.480
Saul, it's me.

18:11.514 --> 18:12.981
Carrie.

18:15.418 --> 18:17.052
Thanks for getting back.

18:17.087 --> 18:19.488
I'm guessing this isn't a social call.

18:19.522 --> 18:20.889
No.

18:20.924 --> 18:21.957
What's going on?

18:21.991 --> 18:23.859
I can't talk.

18:23.894 --> 18:26.729
We're on an open line,

18:26.763 --> 18:28.064
but we need your help.

18:31.268 --> 18:33.068
I know.

18:33.103 --> 18:35.070
I hate myself for even asking.

18:35.105 --> 18:36.505
Well, can't it wait until tomorrow?

18:36.506 --> 18:37.806
I'm afraid not.

18:37.840 --> 18:40.976
David Estes is sitting outside
your house right now.

18:47.118 --> 18:48.652
Well, tonight is Thursday.

18:48.686 --> 18:50.387
I cook dinner for the
family on Thursdays.

18:50.421 --> 18:51.575
I'm making vegetable lasagna

18:51.576 --> 18:53.056
with vegetables I picked this morning

18:53.091 --> 18:54.792
from the garden.

19:01.466 --> 19:04.601
Don't make me talk to him, Saul.

19:04.636 --> 19:06.237
I don't ever want to see him again.

19:06.271 --> 19:07.905
I've put all of that away.

19:11.243 --> 19:12.911
Please, Carrie.

19:14.446 --> 19:17.415
God, why are you doing this to me?!

19:55.187 --> 19:57.889
I want you to know, Carrie,
this is much appreciated.

19:57.923 --> 19:59.657
Just get it over with, okay?

20:16.341 --> 20:18.501
There's a photo inside I'd
like you to take a look at.

20:28.387 --> 20:31.022
Do you recognize her? - Yeah.

20:31.056 --> 20:32.490
I recognize her. Why?

20:32.524 --> 20:33.658
Who is she?

20:35.862 --> 20:37.162
Fatima Ali,

20:37.196 --> 20:38.964
first wife of Abbas Ali.

20:38.998 --> 20:41.667
The Hezbollah district commander.

20:41.702 --> 20:43.636
How do you know her?

20:43.670 --> 20:45.638
I recruited her, that's how.

20:45.673 --> 20:48.509
Yet there's no record of her
ever being an agent of yours.

20:48.543 --> 20:50.710
Well, I ran her off book. - Why?

20:50.745 --> 20:54.381
Because I was interested
in keeping her alive.

20:54.415 --> 20:56.983
Our networks there were
blown, if you remember.

20:57.018 --> 21:00.020
It was right around the time
we lost Garrett Hedges.

21:00.054 --> 21:01.589
How did you make your approach to her?

21:03.659 --> 21:04.692
Carefully,

21:04.726 --> 21:07.795
over a matter of months.

21:07.829 --> 21:10.364
I first spotted her at the
Acadamie des Beaux-Arts.

21:10.398 --> 21:12.533
She had a weakness for American movies.

21:12.567 --> 21:15.402
She loved Julia Roberts.

21:15.436 --> 21:18.305
And did she turn out to
be a valuable asset?

21:18.339 --> 21:20.007
I was transferred to Baghdad

21:20.041 --> 21:21.708
before I had a chance to find out.

21:21.742 --> 21:23.710
So your last contact with her was when?

21:23.744 --> 21:26.846
March, 2005.

21:26.881 --> 21:29.549
It was right before I left Beirut.

21:29.583 --> 21:31.703
I was trying to farm her out
to another case officer.

21:31.704 --> 21:32.652
And?

21:32.687 --> 21:34.087
She wouldn't go for it.

21:34.122 --> 21:36.423
She said I was the only
one she could trust.

21:38.293 --> 21:40.360
So she's been a dead agent ever since?

21:40.394 --> 21:42.696
As far as I know, yeah.

21:42.730 --> 21:45.532
Well, apparently, she came
back to life yesterday,

21:45.566 --> 21:48.502
and with information about
an attack on America.

21:53.141 --> 21:54.674
Tell me.

21:54.709 --> 21:56.510
Unfortunately, that's all I know.

21:56.544 --> 21:59.445
- Well, what do you mean?
- Well, she's refusing

21:59.480 --> 22:01.881
to speak to anybody but you.

22:08.722 --> 22:10.723
Look, Carrie,

22:10.758 --> 22:13.092
I, uh, hear you're doing well,

22:13.127 --> 22:14.227
making good progress...

22:14.261 --> 22:16.196
David, I've had a long day.

22:16.230 --> 22:19.600
If you're gonna ask me to go to
Beirut, just ask me already.

22:19.634 --> 22:21.768
You'll be back in three days.

22:21.803 --> 22:23.937
We just need you to go
meet with your asset,

22:23.971 --> 22:25.339
find out what she knows.

22:27.776 --> 22:30.244
After all the shit you
dragged me through?

22:30.278 --> 22:32.446
The unceremonious humiliating way

22:32.481 --> 22:35.216
you ran me out of the agency?

22:35.250 --> 22:36.770
I didn't come here to open old wounds,

22:36.771 --> 22:39.251
and just so we're clear, this
isn't you getting your job back.

22:39.252 --> 22:41.056
This is you being a good citizen.

22:41.090 --> 22:44.326
Just so we're clear, I
haven't said yes yet.

22:49.198 --> 22:51.565
Carrie, please, this is crazy.

22:51.600 --> 22:53.967
Believe me, I wouldn't be
going if I had a choice.

22:54.002 --> 22:55.269
You do have a choice.

22:55.303 --> 22:56.503
You always have a choice.

22:56.537 --> 22:58.405
Not-not this time.

22:58.439 --> 23:00.774
Carrie, you're just starting
to get back on your feet.

23:00.808 --> 23:02.642
You're not ready for this.

23:02.676 --> 23:04.343
Don't you think I know that?

23:04.378 --> 23:07.347
Regular sleep and meals,
avoiding stress, a schedule.

23:07.381 --> 23:10.950
These are the things that have
been working so well for you.

23:10.984 --> 23:13.520
At least call Dr. Rosenberg
before you make a decision.

23:13.554 --> 23:15.455
I've already decided.

23:15.489 --> 23:17.449
I don't understand how you
can trust these people

23:17.450 --> 23:19.130
for one minute after
what they did to you.

23:19.131 --> 23:20.094
I trust Saul.

23:20.128 --> 23:21.529
He'll be there to hold my hand,

23:21.563 --> 23:23.331
and it's only for a few days.

23:25.234 --> 23:27.769
You say this is about patriotism,

23:27.803 --> 23:30.371
but we both know that's
not the whole story.

23:30.406 --> 23:32.273
Part of you wants to do this.

23:32.307 --> 23:34.175
Let her go, Maggie.

23:34.209 --> 23:38.113
I'm worried she's gonna wind
up back in the hospital.

23:38.147 --> 23:39.647
Let her go.

23:45.420 --> 23:47.655
Thanks, Dad.

23:50.593 --> 23:52.561
Be safe, sweetheart.

24:17.454 --> 24:19.422
Carrie Mathison,

24:19.456 --> 24:22.158
Major Joy Mendez; she'll be
traveling with you to Cyprus.

24:22.192 --> 24:23.359
I'll take your bag, ma'am.

24:23.393 --> 24:25.427
Thank you, Major. Call me Joy.

24:25.462 --> 24:27.029
If you don't call me ma'am.

24:48.785 --> 24:50.052
Come in.

24:51.889 --> 24:53.609
Roya Hammad is doing a
story on veepstakes.

24:53.624 --> 24:55.091
She wants 15 minutes of your time.

24:55.126 --> 24:56.893
When? - Now.

24:56.928 --> 24:59.195
She was just down the hall in
Senator Laughton's office.

24:59.230 --> 25:00.397
She's waiting outside.

25:00.431 --> 25:01.665
All right, bring her in.

25:06.837 --> 25:08.238
Hi, Roya.

25:08.272 --> 25:10.039
Congressman Brody.

25:10.074 --> 25:11.707
Please.

25:11.742 --> 25:13.242
You want me in on this or...

25:13.277 --> 25:15.611
No, I'll be fine.

25:19.183 --> 25:21.884
So...

25:21.919 --> 25:25.721
So, been an extraordinary couple
of days, wouldn't you say?

25:25.756 --> 25:26.956
Depends.

25:26.990 --> 25:28.557
On what?

25:28.592 --> 25:31.060
On whether or not I actually
have a shot at the nomination.

25:31.094 --> 25:33.495
Well, Senator Laughton thinks you do,

25:33.529 --> 25:35.497
and he's not too happy about it.

25:36.933 --> 25:38.968
But that's not why I'm here.

25:41.271 --> 25:43.806
Congressman, do you tape
what's said in this office?

25:45.675 --> 25:48.510
Do you have any hidden recording
devices or video cameras?

25:48.545 --> 25:50.279
No.

25:50.313 --> 25:51.981
Why do you ask?

25:52.015 --> 25:54.783
Because we need to speak privately.

25:54.818 --> 25:56.953
You mean off the record?

25:56.987 --> 25:59.689
I mean privately.

25:59.723 --> 26:01.357
About Abu Nazir.

26:03.160 --> 26:05.161
He sends his best regards.

26:05.196 --> 26:06.863
Excuse me?

26:06.897 --> 26:08.098
Relax, Congressman.

26:08.132 --> 26:09.466
I'm a friend.

26:09.500 --> 26:11.034
Friend of whose? I'm sorry.

26:11.068 --> 26:12.802
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

26:12.837 --> 26:14.804
Of Nazir's.

26:14.838 --> 26:18.274
Our families have been close since 1947.

26:18.309 --> 26:21.444
They were refugees from
Palestine together.

26:25.416 --> 26:28.451
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave now.

26:28.485 --> 26:31.053
Issa's birthday is Monday.

26:32.823 --> 26:36.125
He would have been 13 had he
survived the drone strike.

26:36.159 --> 26:39.061
Do you remember what you gave
him for his tenth birthday?

26:39.095 --> 26:41.997
He was scared of the big, black crows

26:42.018 --> 26:43.298
that perched on the villa walls.

26:43.333 --> 26:45.701
You made him a slingshot.

26:52.276 --> 26:54.244
What do you want?

26:54.278 --> 26:57.481
It's want Nazir want... your help.

26:57.515 --> 26:58.715
My help?

26:58.750 --> 27:00.551
Yes.

27:00.585 --> 27:03.421
David Estes is briefing
you tomorrow morning

27:03.455 --> 27:04.922
on homeland security.

27:07.025 --> 27:08.893
There's a safe in his office

27:08.927 --> 27:10.595
containing the encryption key

27:10.629 --> 27:13.430
to a database of potential targets.

27:13.465 --> 27:15.799
The code to Estes' safe.

27:23.740 --> 27:26.209
If you need these,

27:26.243 --> 27:30.446
you must be planning to
hit one of these targets.

27:30.480 --> 27:32.681
I told Nazir

27:32.716 --> 27:36.552
I would influence lawmakers
through my access.

27:36.586 --> 27:39.588
That is what I'm doing, and
that is what we agreed to.

27:39.622 --> 27:41.390
I know what you agreed to.

27:41.425 --> 27:42.858
I am not a terrorist.

27:42.893 --> 27:44.226
There's a difference

27:44.261 --> 27:45.895
between terrorism

27:45.929 --> 27:48.398
and a justifiable act of retaliation.

27:48.432 --> 27:51.201
I will not help you in the
killing of innocent civilians.

27:51.235 --> 27:54.204
What about the 3,000 civilians
Israel just killed in Iran?

27:54.238 --> 27:55.958
Everybody knows those
numbers are bullshit.

27:55.959 --> 27:57.708
The point is blatant aggression

27:57.742 --> 28:00.110
against a sovereign nation

28:00.144 --> 28:02.112
cannot go unanswered.

28:05.117 --> 28:07.318
Even if I agreed...

28:07.352 --> 28:09.754
<i>if</i> I agreed to do this,

28:09.788 --> 28:13.391
I can't open Estes' safe
while he's in the office.

28:13.425 --> 28:15.593
You'll have your chance.

28:20.666 --> 28:22.301
Nicholas,

28:22.335 --> 28:24.102
we're at war.

28:24.136 --> 28:25.737
You need to choose sides.

28:25.771 --> 28:27.805
Abu Nazir knows

28:27.839 --> 28:29.273
which side I'm on.

28:29.307 --> 28:31.675
I killed Tom Walker.

28:33.512 --> 28:37.314
And I'm sure some part of you
hoped it would end there.

28:39.450 --> 28:43.353
If your allegiance is truly with us,

28:43.387 --> 28:46.055
this is your chance to prove it.

28:48.058 --> 28:50.692
Contact me when you
have the target list.

29:10.113 --> 29:12.614
I couldn't sleep last night.

29:12.682 --> 29:15.417
All I could think about
was Israel bombing Iran

29:15.485 --> 29:18.354
to try to stop Iran from bombing them.

29:18.422 --> 29:21.691
The whole logic of that

29:21.759 --> 29:24.595
just makes me want to scream.

29:24.662 --> 29:26.730
I think maybe

29:26.798 --> 29:29.233
the whole human race is insane.

29:41.678 --> 29:45.080
I think sometimes military
force is necessary.

29:45.148 --> 29:48.450
I mean, the Iranian president
keeps saying he wants to wipe

29:48.518 --> 29:51.753
Israel off the map, so...

29:51.821 --> 29:54.323
they have every right
to defend themselves.

29:56.826 --> 30:00.095
Plus the Arab religion

30:00.163 --> 30:03.098
doesn't value human life the way we do.

30:03.166 --> 30:05.434
I mean, we're the infidel, right?

30:05.501 --> 30:09.271
And these Arabs believe if they kill us,

30:09.339 --> 30:10.973
they get to go to heaven.

30:11.041 --> 30:12.775
And we're supposed to let...

30:12.843 --> 30:14.076
They're not Arabs.

30:16.213 --> 30:19.248
Iranians aren't Arabs, they're Persians.

30:19.316 --> 30:22.451
Dana, I realize you're new here,

30:22.519 --> 30:24.754
but Quaker meeting has rules.

30:24.821 --> 30:26.956
The main one is to remain silent

30:27.024 --> 30:28.925
between statements

30:28.993 --> 30:31.361
so we can each contemplate
what's been said

30:31.429 --> 30:33.830
and what we want to say.

30:33.898 --> 30:36.800
You can speak when Tad sits.

30:38.336 --> 30:41.873
Persians, Arabs, what's the difference?

30:41.940 --> 30:43.807
They both want the same thing,

30:43.875 --> 30:46.310
which is to annihilate us.

30:46.378 --> 30:49.280
Why shouldn't we hit them first?

30:49.348 --> 30:52.717
Maybe with a nuke or two of our own.

30:53.619 --> 30:55.553
Douche.

30:57.089 --> 30:58.890
Did she just call me a douche?

30:58.958 --> 31:01.059
We don't tolerate name-calling.

31:01.127 --> 31:02.227
And what about mass murder?

31:02.295 --> 31:04.229
Do we tolerate that?

31:04.297 --> 31:06.998
I mean, because that's what
he's really saying, isn't it?

31:07.066 --> 31:09.386
- He was just talking.
- He's talking about turning Tehran

31:09.387 --> 31:10.902
into a parking lot. - Dana,

31:10.970 --> 31:12.704
that's enough.

31:12.772 --> 31:14.873
Who do you think you are
and what do you know

31:14.941 --> 31:16.074
about any of this anyways?

31:16.142 --> 31:17.409
What do you know?

31:17.477 --> 31:18.911
Well, what if I told you my dad

31:18.978 --> 31:20.579
is undersecretary of state?

31:20.647 --> 31:23.549
Yeah, well, what if I told
you my dad's a Muslim?

31:26.252 --> 31:28.720
Right, and mine's a Scientologist.

31:30.323 --> 31:31.490
All right.

31:31.558 --> 31:33.458
That's enough.

31:42.939 --> 31:44.704
Okay, Carrie, this is the last one.

31:44.738 --> 31:47.840
One, two, three.

31:47.874 --> 31:49.108
Spell it.

31:49.142 --> 31:51.877
Two Rs, two Ss, and an EY. Morrissey.

31:51.912 --> 31:53.379
Mother's maiden name?

31:55.648 --> 31:57.349
Hold on, I know this one.

31:57.384 --> 31:58.850
It's DeCarlo.

32:00.920 --> 32:02.154
Can we start again?

32:02.188 --> 32:03.822
Sure.

32:03.856 --> 32:06.124
My name is Kate Morrissey.

32:06.159 --> 32:08.527
I was born on October 16, 1981.

32:08.561 --> 32:09.895
Where?

32:09.929 --> 32:13.365
In Ottawa at the
Queensway Carlton Hospital.

32:13.399 --> 32:15.166
But you grew up in... - Calgary.

32:15.201 --> 32:17.068
The hockey team there is...

32:18.938 --> 32:21.340
I don't follow hockey.

32:21.374 --> 32:24.410
You do if you live in Calgary.

32:24.445 --> 32:26.546
The Flames.

32:26.580 --> 32:28.815
Mother's maiden name?

32:28.849 --> 32:31.151
Fuck. Fuck.

32:31.185 --> 32:32.252
It's DeCarlo.

32:32.286 --> 32:33.987
Right, DeCarlo, um,

32:34.021 --> 32:35.589
like the olive oil.

32:35.623 --> 32:38.693
DeCarlo, DeCarlo, DeCarlo,
DeCarlo, DeCarlo, DeCarlo.

32:38.727 --> 32:40.428
Want to take a break?

32:42.731 --> 32:46.167
I think I want to go home.

32:46.201 --> 32:47.568
I understand,

32:47.603 --> 32:50.572
and you will be home
in a short 72 hours.

32:52.608 --> 32:54.509
When's my meet with Saul again?

32:54.544 --> 32:56.411
We're still working on it.

32:56.445 --> 32:57.885
Instructions will be waiting for you

32:57.914 --> 32:59.348
when you get to your hotel room.

32:59.382 --> 33:01.517
At the Commodore.

33:01.551 --> 33:04.186
Correct. You fly commercially
into Rafic-Hariri

33:04.221 --> 33:06.222
tomorrow afternoon, you
grab a cab downtown,

33:06.256 --> 33:08.257
and you check into the Commodore.

33:10.628 --> 33:12.962
What's wrong?

33:12.997 --> 33:14.965
I don't eat meat.

33:38.290 --> 33:39.490
Good, you're home.

33:39.525 --> 33:40.825
Dana!

33:40.860 --> 33:42.060
Why? What is it?

33:42.094 --> 33:43.595
Her dean called today.

33:43.629 --> 33:45.597
Something the three of
us need to talk about.

33:45.631 --> 33:47.599
Dana, get in here now.

33:47.633 --> 33:49.273
I'm coming. You don't have to yell.

33:51.938 --> 33:54.640
- So your dean called?
- You want to tell him?

33:54.674 --> 33:56.834
No, go ahead. I mean, you
obviously know everything...

33:56.835 --> 33:58.810
- She got into a fight.
- It wasn't a fight.

33:58.845 --> 34:00.011
At morning meeting.

34:00.046 --> 34:01.913
I didn't start anything.

34:01.948 --> 34:04.416
- Just a couple of morons that...
- They are not

34:04.451 --> 34:05.851
morons.

34:05.885 --> 34:07.986
Actually, yeah, they are.

34:08.020 --> 34:10.789
Finn Walden was one of them,
the vice president's son.

34:10.822 --> 34:13.257
See? Look, she is just terrified

34:13.292 --> 34:15.659
of causing any sort of
trouble with Mrs. Walden,

34:15.695 --> 34:18.463
- her new best friend.
- Hey, wait, what did they say?

34:20.632 --> 34:22.473
You know I'd rather stick
with what Dana said.

34:22.502 --> 34:24.770
She said you're a Muslim.

34:24.804 --> 34:25.971
And I didn't mean it.

34:26.005 --> 34:28.773
Then why say it?

34:28.806 --> 34:30.542
To guarantee everyone at your new school

34:30.576 --> 34:32.110
thinks you're out of your mind?

34:32.143 --> 34:34.513
To make it impossible for
me to show my face there?

34:34.547 --> 34:36.027
To blow up your father's relationship

34:36.027 --> 34:38.183
with the vice president?
Really, I want to know.

34:38.217 --> 34:40.018
Are you that starved for attention?

34:40.052 --> 34:42.286
Mom, I said it was a mistake.

34:42.322 --> 34:44.188
A mistake? - No one believed it.

34:44.224 --> 34:45.824
That's not the point.

34:45.859 --> 34:48.126
I want to know why you
would say such a thing?

34:48.161 --> 34:50.329
No, don't look at him.

34:50.362 --> 34:51.862
I'm asking you, right here.

34:51.898 --> 34:53.737
Are you deliberately
trying to crash and burn?

34:53.739 --> 34:55.701
Is that it? Do we need
to send you to a shrink?

34:55.735 --> 34:57.054
Jessica, stop. - No, seriously.

34:57.056 --> 34:58.670
I want to know why she would say

34:58.705 --> 34:59.871
such an insane thing.

34:59.906 --> 35:01.573
Because it's true.

35:03.109 --> 35:06.211
What?

35:08.281 --> 35:11.016
Dad, I'm so sorry.

35:11.050 --> 35:13.418
I really did not mean to say anything,

35:13.453 --> 35:15.020
it just slipped out.

35:16.756 --> 35:18.823
Wait...

35:18.858 --> 35:20.526
I didn't want to tell you

35:20.560 --> 35:23.395
because I knew it would upset you.

35:28.101 --> 35:30.368
But you told Dana?

35:30.403 --> 35:33.004
No.

35:33.039 --> 35:36.040
No, she saw me praying one day...

35:36.075 --> 35:38.410
in the garage.

35:39.645 --> 35:41.947
The garage?

35:50.289 --> 35:52.591
Jessica.

35:52.625 --> 35:53.959
Dad...

35:53.993 --> 35:55.360
I didn't mean to.

35:55.394 --> 35:58.597
I know. It's okay.

36:22.321 --> 36:23.722
Jess.

36:23.756 --> 36:25.223
It makes so much sense now,

36:25.257 --> 36:28.760
why you spend so much
fucking time in here.

36:28.794 --> 36:30.128
Do you want to know why?

36:30.162 --> 36:31.396
Does it matter?

36:31.430 --> 36:32.631
It does to me.

36:32.665 --> 36:34.766
What matters is you lied to me.

36:34.801 --> 36:38.069
Every time that you came in
here you were lying to me.

36:38.104 --> 36:39.070
No.

36:39.105 --> 36:40.739
Yes, Brody, yes.

36:40.773 --> 36:43.241
Do you know how fucked up that is?

36:43.276 --> 36:45.644
Do you know how much that hurts?

36:45.678 --> 36:48.346
I'm sorry.

36:50.149 --> 36:52.517
I-I don't understand.

36:52.551 --> 36:55.286
These are the people who tortured you.

36:55.321 --> 36:57.121
These are the people
who if they found out

36:57.156 --> 36:58.155
Dana and Xander

36:58.190 --> 36:59.524
were having sex, they would

36:59.558 --> 37:02.327
stone her to death in a soccer stadium.

37:02.361 --> 37:04.596
That's not supposed to touch the floor.

37:08.901 --> 37:12.336
Did you actually just say that?

37:24.549 --> 37:27.952
I thought you put this
crazy stuff behind you.

37:27.986 --> 37:29.620
I thought we were getting somewhere.

37:29.654 --> 37:30.821
We are.

37:30.855 --> 37:32.356
No, we're not.

37:35.660 --> 37:38.695
I married a U.S. Marine.

37:38.729 --> 37:41.364
This...

37:41.399 --> 37:43.399
this can't happen.

37:43.434 --> 37:46.135
You have a wife, two kids.

37:46.169 --> 37:47.870
You're a congressman in the running

37:47.904 --> 37:49.638
to be vice president.

37:49.673 --> 37:51.140
It cannot happen.

37:51.174 --> 37:52.975
You get that, right?

37:54.044 --> 37:57.180
Yeah, Jess, I do.

38:08.225 --> 38:10.393
Does she know?

38:10.427 --> 38:12.729
Who?

38:12.763 --> 38:15.065
The CIA woman...

38:15.099 --> 38:17.100
you were with.

38:17.134 --> 38:19.502
Does she know you're Muslim?

38:19.537 --> 38:22.104
Why are you even asking me that?

38:22.139 --> 38:24.440
Because she stood on our lawn
and said a bunch of things

38:24.474 --> 38:26.475
I'm remembering all of a sudden.

38:28.278 --> 38:31.680
Jess, that woman...

38:31.714 --> 38:33.381
was fired by the CIA

38:33.416 --> 38:36.284
and locked up in a mental institution.

38:58.340 --> 39:00.308
Carrie.

39:00.342 --> 39:02.276
Carrie.

39:10.018 --> 39:11.252
Hey.

39:11.286 --> 39:12.653
Wake up.

39:12.688 --> 39:14.956
What time is it?

39:14.990 --> 39:17.092
2:30.

39:17.126 --> 39:19.260
In the afternoon?

39:19.295 --> 39:20.895
Yeah.

39:20.930 --> 39:23.098
We're moving out in a
little over an hour.

39:23.132 --> 39:24.766
I need you to get up now.

39:26.870 --> 39:28.337
You gonna be ready by then?

39:28.371 --> 39:30.573
No problem.

39:30.607 --> 39:32.475
Okay.

40:00.570 --> 40:02.238
Sir.

40:02.272 --> 40:03.539
Please take off your jacket

40:03.574 --> 40:05.475
and remove anything from your pockets.

40:05.509 --> 40:07.843
We'll need to retain your cell
phone, sir, till you leave.

40:07.878 --> 40:09.879
Thank you very much.

40:16.186 --> 40:17.887
Step through.

40:17.922 --> 40:19.488
She seemed okay when I saw her.

40:19.523 --> 40:20.490
In Virginia,

40:20.524 --> 40:21.739
in the bosom of her family

40:21.740 --> 40:23.660
where her mental state is
coddled and cared for.

40:23.694 --> 40:25.995
Now she's 6,000 miles away.

40:26.029 --> 40:28.565
Mendez is there, she doesn't
think Carrie's up to it.

40:28.599 --> 40:30.233
Is this Mendez talking or you?

40:30.267 --> 40:31.401
It's both of us.

40:31.435 --> 40:32.869
We've been through this, Saul.

40:32.903 --> 40:34.804
We have no other options.

40:34.839 --> 40:36.740
No good ones, I admit,

40:36.774 --> 40:39.242
but if Carrie fucks up this
operation then we have none.

40:41.246 --> 40:43.247
- Can we push back 24 hours?
- For what reason?

40:43.281 --> 40:45.816
I'm still waiting to
hear from two sources.

40:45.850 --> 40:47.650
Maybe one of them's
gotten wind of something.

40:47.651 --> 40:49.420
That married couple?

40:49.454 --> 40:51.689
The professors with the
American University?

40:51.723 --> 40:53.683
They're not sources, Saul,
they're dinner guests.

40:53.684 --> 40:55.593
You said so yourself.

40:55.627 --> 40:57.995
Look, I know you're
worried about Carrie.

40:58.030 --> 40:59.530
I am, too.

40:59.564 --> 41:02.366
But we got the wife of
Hezbollah commander

41:02.401 --> 41:06.303
who says she has intel about
an attack against America.

41:08.540 --> 41:10.608
You still there?

41:10.642 --> 41:12.944
I'm here.

41:12.978 --> 41:14.779
The mission clock starts in an hour.

41:14.813 --> 41:17.882
When the door opens, I need you
to walk Carrie through it.

41:26.626 --> 41:28.894
Sorry I'm late. I got held up by a call.

41:28.928 --> 41:31.296
No, I appreciate you taking the time.

41:31.330 --> 41:32.965
I'm sure you got your hands full.

41:32.999 --> 41:35.199
And I was just getting used
to calling you Congressman.

41:35.200 --> 41:37.536
The convention's still months away.

41:37.570 --> 41:39.471
A lot can happen between now and then.

41:39.505 --> 41:41.640
I doubt the vice president
would be taking

41:41.674 --> 41:43.475
such a personal interest in prepping you

41:43.509 --> 41:46.411
unless he was serious
about your prospects.

41:46.445 --> 41:47.979
Please, have a seat.

41:51.449 --> 41:54.552
So, uh, I understand you
used to work together

41:54.586 --> 41:57.421
when he ran the agency...
the vice president.

41:57.455 --> 41:59.924
Bill Walden's the
reason I'm in this job.

41:59.958 --> 42:02.093
He pulled me off a division desk

42:02.128 --> 42:03.795
to help him run the drone program

42:03.829 --> 42:06.631
back when we only had eight
Predators over Baghdad.

42:07.800 --> 42:09.167
How many do you have now?

42:09.201 --> 42:11.135
How many?

42:11.170 --> 42:12.436
Predators.

42:12.471 --> 42:14.839
I don't know, 8,000? 9,000?

42:14.873 --> 42:16.174
You lost count?

42:16.208 --> 42:18.309
Al-Qaeda's been gutted

42:18.344 --> 42:19.611
because of those drones.

42:19.645 --> 42:21.246
That's what matters, right?

42:21.280 --> 42:23.481
Right.

42:23.516 --> 42:24.849
Come in.

42:24.884 --> 42:26.851
I'm sorry for interrupting, sir,

42:26.886 --> 42:29.187
but we've got a time sensitive matter.

42:29.221 --> 42:30.689
What is it?

42:30.723 --> 42:32.043
You can speak freely, as long

42:32.058 --> 42:33.425
as it's not classified.

42:33.460 --> 42:34.540
Roya Hammad... she's filing

42:34.561 --> 42:36.161
an on-air story tonight

42:36.196 --> 42:38.197
and she wants a comment. - What? Now?

42:38.231 --> 42:39.832
She's in the pressroom.

42:41.735 --> 42:43.603
Media Relations should be handling this.

42:43.637 --> 42:46.272
They tried. They sent down
the Public Affairs officer,

42:46.306 --> 42:48.641
but the DCI just weighed in,
wants you to talk to her.

42:50.510 --> 42:52.611
I am sorry to keep apologizing,

42:52.646 --> 42:54.279
but I need to take care of this.

42:54.314 --> 42:55.781
No, do what you got to do.

42:55.815 --> 42:57.483
You can wait here, I won't be long.

42:59.086 --> 43:02.488
Can I get you anything? Coffee? Water?

43:02.523 --> 43:03.556
No, I'm good.

43:03.590 --> 43:04.857
Thanks.

44:15.960 --> 44:17.628
Deputy Director?

44:17.662 --> 44:19.796
Ms. Hammad, what can I do for you?

44:19.830 --> 44:22.565
Please.

44:22.600 --> 44:26.069
You can confirm or deny
reports that only four

44:26.103 --> 44:28.237
of the targeted Iranian
nuclear facilities

44:28.271 --> 44:29.772
were actually destroyed,

44:29.806 --> 44:32.408
and that the fifth is still operational.

44:32.442 --> 44:35.110
Reports from who?

44:35.144 --> 44:37.246
Multiple sources inside the government.

44:37.280 --> 44:39.348
Ours or theirs?

45:11.280 --> 45:13.314
We're breaking the story
tonight on <i>World News</i>

45:13.349 --> 45:15.316
with or without a statement
from the agency.

45:15.350 --> 45:20.020
Do what you have to do, but
if I were you, I'd sit on it.

45:20.054 --> 45:22.756
Unless you're okay with being
wrong about the facts.

45:22.791 --> 45:24.525
What do you mean?

45:26.294 --> 45:28.695
Have a nice weekend, Ms. Hammad.

45:28.730 --> 45:31.498
You know I'm close, so at
least help me get it right.

45:31.533 --> 45:32.700
Not a chance.

45:32.734 --> 45:34.335
How about dinner then?

45:36.805 --> 45:39.541
Saturday night? Cafe Milano.

45:39.575 --> 45:42.645
I've got a standing
reservation for two. 8:00.

45:42.679 --> 45:46.316
You can ply me with wine, feed me pasta.

45:46.350 --> 45:48.885
I still won't divulge
classified intelligence.

45:48.919 --> 45:50.487
No worries.

45:50.521 --> 45:53.723
I'm sure we could find
something else to talk about.

45:56.160 --> 45:59.495
All right.

45:59.529 --> 46:02.498
Is that a yes?

46:02.532 --> 46:05.334
Yes.

46:05.369 --> 46:07.737
Saturday.

46:28.358 --> 46:31.727
Tell Korman he needs
to do damage control.

46:31.761 --> 46:33.595
See if he can give Roya something else.

46:33.630 --> 46:35.731
Get her to sit on the story until

46:35.766 --> 46:37.299
we can find out who leaked this.

46:38.768 --> 46:41.536
Everything okay?

46:41.571 --> 46:44.206
Yeah, fine.

47:22.079 --> 47:23.980
Traveling alone?

47:24.014 --> 47:25.415
Miss Morrissey?

47:25.449 --> 47:26.816
I'm sorry?

47:26.850 --> 47:28.951
I asked if you're traveling alone.

47:28.985 --> 47:30.853
Yes.

47:37.628 --> 47:39.662
You have anything to declare?

47:39.697 --> 47:41.131
No.

47:57.016 --> 47:59.418
Hotel Commodore.

48:45.233 --> 48:47.133
Carrie?

48:47.168 --> 48:49.502
Sorry I'm late. Half the
streets are shut down.

48:49.537 --> 48:51.004
Yeah. People are pissed.

48:51.038 --> 48:52.739
So I've noticed.

48:52.773 --> 48:53.706
How was your flight?

48:53.740 --> 48:54.974
A little bumpy.

48:55.008 --> 48:56.375
But you made it.

48:56.410 --> 49:00.513
Yeah. It's just like old times.

49:03.217 --> 49:04.550
Carrie, listen to me carefully.

49:04.585 --> 49:06.920
You need to walk past the cafe.
Do not stop.

49:06.954 --> 49:07.821
Why?

49:07.855 --> 49:08.989
I got company.

49:09.023 --> 49:11.191
You hear me?

49:11.225 --> 49:12.326
Yeah.

49:12.360 --> 49:13.727
There's a safe house

49:13.761 --> 49:15.195
on El Ghadin. 2218.

49:15.230 --> 49:16.897
I'll meet you there when I lose them.

49:16.932 --> 49:18.432
Okay. - Repeat the address.

49:18.467 --> 49:20.901
2212 El Ghadin.

49:20.936 --> 49:22.336
2218.

49:22.371 --> 49:26.441
2218.

49:47.730 --> 49:49.231
Shit.

49:49.265 --> 49:51.065
They may have made you, Carrie.
There's a man

49:51.066 --> 49:53.306
with a gray jacket, yellow
stripes crossing El Barghout.

49:53.307 --> 49:54.536
His partner's still on me,

49:54.571 --> 49:56.205
so I'm pinned here, but you'll be okay.

49:56.240 --> 49:58.360
Dump your radio phone, let
him take you into custody.

49:58.395 --> 50:00.355
Your cover will hold until
we get the ambassador.

50:00.356 --> 50:01.377
I can lose him, Saul.

50:01.411 --> 50:02.979
If you run, you'll only make it worse.

50:03.013 --> 50:04.653
If they arrest me,
this mission is blown.

50:04.687 --> 50:05.767
Don't worry about that now.

50:07.451 --> 50:10.086
Carrie?

50:10.120 --> 50:12.021
Carrie?

53:31.121 --> 53:33.456
Dad?

53:34.725 --> 53:37.793
What are you doing?

53:40.898 --> 53:42.999
Your mom threw my Koran on the floor,

53:43.033 --> 53:45.669
tore some pages.

53:45.703 --> 53:48.004
It's desecrated.

53:48.038 --> 53:52.475
So I'm burying it out of respect.

54:01.987 --> 54:04.288
Here, Dad, let me help.
