00:01.569 --> 00:03.150
Tonight on the curse of Oak Island

00:03.150 --> 00:06.830
go find a some after decades of planning

00:06.830 --> 00:09.559
whoa three years up testing predates the

00:09.559 --> 00:12.139
money pit by at least 150 years and one

00:12.139 --> 00:17.200
year up digging the wait to find out

00:17.200 --> 00:21.400
what really lies at the bottom of 10x is

00:21.400 --> 00:24.800
over our brothers Rick and Marty lagina

00:24.800 --> 00:28.179
about to solve the Oak Island mystery

00:28.179 --> 00:32.229
and will the answers they have worked so

00:32.229 --> 00:33.760
hard to get

00:33.760 --> 00:36.040
simply serve as a gateway

00:36.040 --> 00:37.040
standby

00:37.040 --> 00:41.280
leading them through even more

00:41.280 --> 00:46.550
incredible discoveries

00:46.550 --> 00:50.020
there is an island in the North Atlantic

00:50.020 --> 00:51.760
where people have been looking for an

00:51.760 --> 00:54.739
incredible treasure for more than 200

00:54.739 --> 00:58.460
years so far they have found bits of

00:58.460 --> 01:02.040
gold chain a stone slab with strange

01:02.040 --> 01:05.489
symbols carved into it even a 17th

01:05.489 --> 01:09.479
century Spanish coin to date six men

01:09.479 --> 01:13.250
have died trying to solve the mystery

01:13.350 --> 01:15.710
And according to legend

01:15.810 --> 01:17.880
one more will have to die

01:17.980 --> 01:20.420
before the treasure can found

01:22.000 --> 01:28.074

01:41.420 --> 01:43.950
not so bad everybody is like mouth open

01:43.950 --> 01:49.719
animes it is one of the most important

01:49.719 --> 01:57.610
days in the history of Oak Island

01:57.610 --> 02:00.160
copy that hose and pressure are both

02:00.160 --> 02:01.160
good

02:01.160 --> 02:03.560
as brothers Rick and Marty lagina and

02:03.560 --> 02:06.110
Craig tester along with their partners

02:06.110 --> 02:09.560
are just moments away from finding out

02:09.560 --> 02:12.120
what lies at the bottom of the infamous

02:12.120 --> 02:15.500
man-made borehole known as 10x

02:26.400 --> 02:28.590
after months of clearing the shaft of

02:28.590 --> 02:31.150
obstructions and an exhaustive search

02:31.150 --> 02:33.140
for someone who could manage the

02:33.140 --> 02:36.300
difficult and dangerous final descent

02:36.300 --> 02:38.650
through a narrow 27-inch Whitehall

02:38.650 --> 02:42.490
world-renowned diner John Chatterton is

02:42.490 --> 02:45.340
now in a mysterious underwater chamber

02:45.340 --> 02:48.490
235 feet below ground

02:48.490 --> 02:51.910
if he does find something it blows the

02:51.910 --> 02:52.970
whole thing wide open

02:52.970 --> 02:55.350
he comes up even with a piece of wood

02:55.350 --> 02:58.860
from a post that he says is 14 by 14 or

02:58.860 --> 03:01.380
12 by 12 and it's from floor to ceiling

03:01.380 --> 03:03.910
yeah I just sit back and you I told just

03:03.910 --> 03:09.760
alright fine I'd be happy for you to do

03:09.760 --> 03:10.760
this

03:10.760 --> 03:15.350
can you see anything yeah grounded in

03:15.350 --> 03:17.770
Michigan due to the threat of a possible

03:17.770 --> 03:21.260
hurricane Marty and Craig tester are not

03:21.260 --> 03:23.260
able to be on the island in person for

03:23.260 --> 03:27.090
this exciting day nevertheless they have

03:27.090 --> 03:28.670
arranged to witness the dive

03:28.670 --> 03:29.950
via videoconference

03:29.950 --> 03:40.350
he's been 25 minutes in the water since

03:40.350 --> 03:42.560
veteran treasure hunter dan Blankenship

03:42.560 --> 03:47.170
dug 10x in the 1970s only a handful of

03:47.170 --> 03:48.940
men have successfully made it to the

03:48.940 --> 03:52.330
bottom and none of them including dan

03:52.330 --> 03:55.740
has been able to prove his claim that a

03:55.740 --> 03:59.560
wooden post man-made tunnels treasure

03:59.560 --> 04:02.880
chests and even human remains really do

04:02.880 --> 04:04.500
lie inside the chamber

04:04.500 --> 04:39.150
rattle a metal object protruding from

04:39.150 --> 04:51.570
the floor of the chamber yes sir we can

04:51.570 --> 05:00.190
see it copy that it's standing up about

05:00.190 --> 05:05.450
six foot off the bottom it's still no

05:05.450 --> 05:06.770
post

05:06.770 --> 05:15.750
so could that be the object that penny

05:15.750 --> 05:21.930
found earlier this year after running

05:21.930 --> 05:25.240
scanning sonar in the bottom of 10x

05:25.240 --> 05:27.430
underwater imaging expert Brian Abbott

05:27.430 --> 05:30.230
believed there were not one but two

05:30.230 --> 05:33.080
large vertical posts possibly made of

05:33.080 --> 05:36.640
wood located in the chamber percent

05:36.640 --> 05:42.310
confidence ninety percent good John

05:42.310 --> 05:44.280
Chatterton had just discovered that one

05:44.280 --> 05:46.670
of the post light objects is actually a

05:46.670 --> 05:50.580
metal drill pipe when John describes

05:50.580 --> 05:52.440
what he's feeling down there about the

05:52.440 --> 05:55.860
drill bar this six-foot tall piece of

05:55.860 --> 05:58.660
pipe with the gap in between I'm shaking

05:58.660 --> 06:19.460
my head like what I can't beat

06:19.460 --> 06:28.100
very step like we saw in this owner yeah

06:28.100 --> 06:36.180
what what is that done
clay affirmative

06:36.180 --> 06:44.970
the bottom is clay all of those sending

06:44.970 --> 06:47.139
the human diver down to the bottom of

06:47.139 --> 06:50.710
10-x has proven to be both expensive and

06:50.710 --> 06:52.360
extremely dangerous

06:52.360 --> 06:55.190
the laginas and their partners believe

06:55.190 --> 06:57.780
that only human intelligence can verify

06:57.780 --> 07:00.310
if the underground chamber is man-made

07:00.310 --> 07:04.220
they are also eager to know if it

07:04.220 --> 07:06.560
contains tunnels or passageways that

07:06.560 --> 07:08.730
could prove to be a shortcut into the

07:08.730 --> 07:17.520
original Oak Island money pit yeah yeah

07:17.520 --> 07:29.840
I think we can kind of see it

07:29.840 --> 07:35.591
all stop

07:35.591 --> 07:44.330
the silk covered bottom of 10-x has

07:44.330 --> 07:46.330
suddenly become disturbed by John

07:46.330 --> 07:48.919
chatter dance movements this ability is

07:48.919 --> 07:50.370
now virtually at zero

07:50.370 --> 08:29.200
what are you doing down John

08:29.200 --> 08:31.730
according to VOC Islands legend when the

08:31.730 --> 08:33.710
mummy pit was dug several hundred years

08:33.710 --> 08:37.440
ago a slave was left behind to die so

08:37.440 --> 08:41.419
that his spirit would guard the treasure

08:41.419 --> 08:43.339
could John Chatterton be close to

08:43.339 --> 09:11.200
proving that the legend was true

09:11.200 --> 09:15.020
sink holes at the bottom of 10-x

09:15.020 --> 09:17.040
could this be an indication that below

09:17.040 --> 09:19.660
the layers of silt lies an entrance to

09:19.660 --> 09:23.540
another even bluer chamber

09:23.540 --> 09:29.690
copy that John you're saying there's

09:29.690 --> 09:37.580
moving water in there

09:37.580 --> 09:40.960
all I'd really like to reiterate to John

09:40.960 --> 09:42.950
that the importance of the tunnel Rick

09:42.950 --> 09:45.050
would really like for you to be able to

09:45.050 --> 09:48.300
verify the tunnels existence and you

09:48.300 --> 09:50.890
know whether or not they're natural or

09:50.890 --> 10:08.990
silted in or whatever you know I'm

10:08.990 --> 10:14.640
saying

10:14.640 --> 10:31.850
John did you say you were in the tunnel

10:31.850 --> 10:47.820
you

10:47.820 --> 10:49.720
I was looking at the monitor with my

10:49.720 --> 10:53.520
brother on it and he sat up like what

10:53.520 --> 11:00.800
top rectangular and you feel anything is

11:00.800 --> 11:04.240
shaped or carved or nothing feels shaped

11:04.240 --> 11:06.120
or carp does it feel natural to you or

11:06.120 --> 11:08.140
does it feel like it could be possibly

11:08.140 --> 11:18.770
man-made you had to crawl in or could

11:18.770 --> 11:20.180
you walk into it

11:20.180 --> 11:28.320
but Angela was great but the grumbly

11:28.320 --> 11:30.400
thing over time wouldn't Ian hydrate if

11:30.400 --> 11:33.390
you you know take away the traces of

11:33.390 --> 11:38.000
human pickaxe much rode it like crazy

11:38.000 --> 11:52.140
right is there anything else you want to

11:52.140 --> 12:04.180
do already anything else you want to

12:04.180 --> 12:10.430
bring them up after months of

12:10.430 --> 12:12.709
back-breaking work and frustrating

12:12.709 --> 12:15.839
setbacks Rick Marty and their partners

12:15.839 --> 12:18.339
are about to realize this year's most

12:18.339 --> 12:20.070
important goal

12:20.070 --> 12:23.810
to find out once and for all if 10x

12:23.810 --> 12:25.640
really is an underground treasure

12:25.640 --> 12:30.120
chamber there will be no more guessing

12:30.120 --> 12:33.100
we'll get first-hand account from

12:33.100 --> 12:35.120
someone who was in that room what he

12:35.120 --> 12:41.660
believes is in that room or not in them

12:41.660 --> 12:48.970
okay here we are for the big debrief

12:48.970 --> 12:51.420
yes we're all ears and you know we're

12:51.420 --> 12:53.730
really glad to see John there in the

12:53.730 --> 12:56.850
flesh that's very heartwarming pass we

12:56.850 --> 12:58.670
would not have left him gone hole no

12:58.670 --> 13:02.490
matter what he had to say okay well

13:02.490 --> 13:04.520
here's the thing guys I think we all

13:04.520 --> 13:06.399
know why we're here and that is you know

13:06.399 --> 13:08.680
to get some feedback I think I can put a

13:08.680 --> 13:11.720
lot of this into context drawing makes

13:11.720 --> 13:15.000
it a lot easier yeah once you setup like

13:15.000 --> 13:16.730
you know how do you trust in transition

13:16.730 --> 13:20.730
don't know if we're talking here's the

13:20.730 --> 13:23.149
27-inch hole comes out the ceiling is

13:23.149 --> 13:25.540
pretty much solid rock but it's somewhat

13:25.540 --> 13:29.080
irregular but the six inch drill pipe

13:29.080 --> 13:34.300
stops there directly below it we've got

13:34.300 --> 13:37.779
four inch and the four inch goes goes

13:37.779 --> 13:39.790
kind of down into the bottom like that

13:39.790 --> 13:43.339
how is it from floor to ceiling this is

13:43.339 --> 13:46.170
six foot in height from the bottom if I

13:46.170 --> 13:48.090
stood with my feet on either side of

13:48.090 --> 13:51.339
this which leads me to believe we're

13:51.339 --> 13:54.350
talking 1012 feet of elevation from the

13:54.350 --> 13:57.149
top of the mound to the underside of the

13:57.149 --> 14:01.430
overhead Rock are you a hundred percent

14:01.430 --> 14:05.610
certain that the only post white object

14:05.610 --> 14:10.900
in that chamber is that four inch pipe

14:10.900 --> 14:12.899
sticking up

14:12.899 --> 14:15.680
absolutely like when John describes what

14:15.680 --> 14:17.640
he's feeling down there about the drill

14:17.640 --> 14:20.920
bar this six-foot tall piece of pipe and

14:20.920 --> 14:23.170
the big question is where's the post the

14:23.170 --> 14:25.220
mythical post the post that was always

14:25.220 --> 14:28.350
there in the sonar imagery where is it

14:28.350 --> 14:31.110
I'm looking at David these puzzles so

14:31.110 --> 14:33.860
that's not the drill rod so I have no

14:33.860 --> 14:36.360
idea wearing that that game from before

14:36.360 --> 14:38.940
engineer right right

14:38.940 --> 14:42.149
when treasure hunter dan Blankenship

14:42.149 --> 14:45.280
don't to the bottom of 10x in the 1970s

14:45.280 --> 14:48.600
he was convinced he saw what appeared to

14:48.600 --> 14:51.760
be a large square wooden post running

14:51.760 --> 14:53.490
straight up to the ceiling from the

14:53.490 --> 14:57.180
floor of the underground chamber over

14:57.180 --> 14:59.930
the decades various underwater cameras

14:59.930 --> 15:02.660
and even sonar data collected earlier

15:02.660 --> 15:05.019
this year by underwater imaging expert

15:05.019 --> 15:07.670
Brian Abbott have verified the presence

15:07.670 --> 15:11.290
of at least one and possibly two large

15:11.290 --> 15:14.110
vertical posts yes we were able to

15:14.110 --> 15:16.410
definitively find two posts that are

15:16.410 --> 15:19.140
here is it possible that because of the

15:19.140 --> 15:21.360
challenging dive conditions and poor

15:21.360 --> 15:24.300
visibility John Chatterton simply missed

15:24.300 --> 15:28.310
finding two large wooden posts

15:28.310 --> 15:30.500
one of the things that that you guys

15:30.500 --> 15:33.170
were definitely interested in was was

15:33.170 --> 15:38.550
the box yes right about here I had a

15:38.550 --> 15:43.000
rock that I would estimate was 10 inches

15:43.000 --> 15:44.480
to 12 inches

15:44.480 --> 15:47.760
it was very angular had at least one 90

15:47.760 --> 15:50.290
degree angle on it I picked it up I

15:50.290 --> 15:54.670
moved it it was it was heavy if you look

15:54.670 --> 15:58.890
at the Brian Abbot drawing and I look at

15:58.890 --> 16:03.360
where I found that stone to me that was

16:03.360 --> 16:06.110
what gave you the sonar signal of the

16:06.110 --> 16:15.740
box when Brian did his sonar survey this

16:15.740 --> 16:18.300
was the area right here where he had the

16:18.300 --> 16:23.089
shadow the possible human form right now

16:23.089 --> 16:26.740
if I'm probing here it just created a

16:26.740 --> 16:29.320
little sinkhole and some of the

16:29.320 --> 16:31.890
surrounding stuff started going down

16:31.890 --> 16:33.839
that be consistent with the scour you

16:33.839 --> 16:36.360
know it's a sunken part would look like

16:36.360 --> 16:38.680
a darker spot of shadow it could look

16:38.680 --> 16:43.240
like a body Bennis on our image

16:43.240 --> 16:44.970
is it correct I don't know you don't

16:44.970 --> 16:47.010
again no we don't have eyes on target

16:47.010 --> 16:51.430
he's he's feeling with his feet with his

16:51.430 --> 16:53.860
hands John here's the ultimate question

16:53.860 --> 17:00.070
odds from your exploration of that being

17:00.070 --> 17:05.240
man-made I think

17:05.240 --> 17:06.949
it looks like a natural formation

17:06.949 --> 17:15.749
what do you think what are you dropping

17:15.749 --> 17:20.230
all this pretty sobering you know huh I

17:20.230 --> 17:23.999
don't know when we put an X in 10x and

17:23.999 --> 17:28.739
move on to other places on that island

17:28.739 --> 17:32.070
not right now they need to go over the

17:32.070 --> 17:35.679
data okay the only way to get definitive

17:35.679 --> 17:38.630
answers at the bottom of 10x is to drain

17:38.630 --> 17:42.149
it but I've long held that opinion if

17:42.149 --> 17:44.649
there's any kind of confusion after this

17:44.649 --> 17:46.340
we need to go down there and the dry

17:46.340 --> 17:49.529
from what I've seen you did everything

17:49.529 --> 17:52.260
you promised it more honest to god I

17:52.260 --> 17:55.869
mean I'm impressed no question about it

17:55.869 --> 17:58.649
fun project thanks for having us yeah

17:58.649 --> 18:01.100
thanks for having another pair is fun

18:01.100 --> 18:04.120
for Rick Marty and the Oak Island team

18:04.120 --> 18:06.580
John Chatterton's report has proven to

18:06.580 --> 18:08.940
be something of a double-edged sword

18:08.940 --> 18:15.259
take care on the one hand it contradicts

18:15.259 --> 18:17.200
the accounts of dan Blankenship

18:17.200 --> 18:21.100
who spent most of his life and fortune

18:21.100 --> 18:24.389
trying to prove that 10x was a gateway

18:24.389 --> 18:25.730
into the money pit

18:25.730 --> 18:29.980
on the other it offers some badly needed

18:29.980 --> 18:32.840
answers at a time when the laginas and

18:32.840 --> 18:34.600
their partners have been trying to

18:34.600 --> 18:37.070
choose between putting more money into

18:37.070 --> 18:38.159
10x

18:38.159 --> 18:42.109
or instead focusing their resources over

18:42.109 --> 18:45.649
at the money pit or they have recently

18:45.649 --> 18:57.169
made an incredible discovery

18:57.169 --> 19:06.710
you

19:06.710 --> 19:09.159
one day after John Chatterton's historic

19:09.159 --> 19:12.580
dive to the bottom of 10x Rick and Marty

19:12.580 --> 19:15.059
lagina are welcoming three special

19:15.059 --> 19:18.080
guests to Oak Island welcome oh thank

19:18.080 --> 19:22.039
you thank you so much

19:22.039 --> 19:25.399
sisters Joan gene and joints McGinnis

19:25.399 --> 19:27.309
are direct descendants of Daniel

19:27.309 --> 19:29.529
McGinnis

19:29.529 --> 19:32.039
one of the three teenage boys who first

19:32.039 --> 19:39.700
discovered the money pit back in 1795

19:39.700 --> 19:41.650
after learning of the recent activities

19:41.650 --> 19:45.049
on Oak Island they contacted Rick lagina

19:45.049 --> 19:47.419
in hopes of sharing what they believe is

19:47.419 --> 19:48.980
some important information

19:48.980 --> 19:53.460
what is your impression so far of coming

19:53.460 --> 19:57.700
back to Oak Island Oh me I'm amazed

19:57.700 --> 20:01.269
this is magic all the stories and things

20:01.269 --> 20:02.940
that to me were fairy tales

20:02.940 --> 20:05.009
nothing real the real genius

20:05.009 --> 20:18.890
as this is their first visit to Oak

20:18.890 --> 20:21.830
Island the McGinnis sisters are being

20:21.830 --> 20:24.429
treated by Rick lagina to a special tour

20:24.429 --> 20:26.470
by local historian and fellow treasure

20:26.470 --> 20:30.700
hunter Charles Barkhouse

20:30.700 --> 20:33.399
this isn't the money pit where your

20:33.399 --> 20:35.549
ancestors were standing probably right

20:35.549 --> 20:40.679
in this area right here

20:40.679 --> 20:43.240
it's a special place there's so much

20:43.240 --> 20:47.169
activity that went on here

20:47.169 --> 20:51.100
by so many different groups

20:51.100 --> 20:53.799
after finding what they believed to be a

20:53.799 --> 20:55.580
hiding place for pirate treasure under

20:55.580 --> 20:58.649
an old oak tree Daniel McGinnis and his

20:58.649 --> 21:01.450
two friends John Smith and Anthony

21:01.450 --> 21:03.940
Vaughn spent the next several months

21:03.940 --> 21:05.929
digging in the place that would later be

21:05.929 --> 21:10.159
known as the Oak Island money pit

21:10.159 --> 21:11.861
10-foot intervals they found what

21:11.861 --> 21:13.720
appeared to be man-made workings

21:13.720 --> 21:17.320
including Oak timber platforms and

21:17.320 --> 21:22.220
carefully fashioned layers of clay and

21:22.220 --> 21:23.220
slate

21:23.220 --> 21:24.220
eventually each young man purchased

21:24.220 --> 21:25.889
property on the island in order to

21:25.889 --> 21:30.220
secure their claim and in 1803 formed a

21:30.220 --> 21:32.409
partnership with businessman Simeon

21:32.409 --> 21:33.409
Lin's

21:33.409 --> 21:35.320
so they could finance what was rapidly

21:35.320 --> 21:39.700
becoming a full-time operation in 1804

21:39.700 --> 21:42.749
after successfully excavating the pit to

21:42.749 --> 21:45.659
a depth of 90 feet McGinnis and his

21:45.659 --> 21:48.690
partners unearthed a large stone slab

21:48.690 --> 21:50.850
with strange carved markings on it

21:50.850 --> 21:54.159
but when they later removed it the hole

21:54.159 --> 21:56.789
filled with seawater as if some sort of

21:56.789 --> 22:02.200
booby trap had been sprung

22:02.200 --> 22:05.970
so where's the oak tree unfortunately

22:05.970 --> 22:08.929
many many years ago the oak tree was cut

22:08.929 --> 22:11.909
down it is interesting to what you just

22:11.909 --> 22:15.279
asked it's the tree still here people do

22:15.279 --> 22:18.809
come with that sense of it that it's

22:18.809 --> 22:21.789
almost like this little area time has

22:21.789 --> 22:25.759
Stood Still and all is as it once was

22:25.759 --> 22:27.629
maybe in some way you said it maybe in

22:27.629 --> 22:33.690
some ways it is 220 years ago Daniel was

22:33.690 --> 22:37.700
walking on that very ground they know

22:37.700 --> 22:40.279
that story intimately and they were

22:40.279 --> 22:43.100
meshed in it they were living it in that

22:43.100 --> 22:45.370
moment and you could see their minds

22:45.370 --> 22:47.090
rolling and I think that was really

22:47.090 --> 22:49.620
really wonderful

22:49.620 --> 22:54.450
Wow Wow

22:54.450 --> 23:02.470
right up here of course is the McGinnis

23:02.470 --> 23:07.919
foundation yes this is where they lived

23:07.919 --> 23:15.999
right here Wow Wow

23:15.999 --> 23:17.039
this would have been the root cellar

23:17.039 --> 23:18.179
this would have been the entrance down

23:18.179 --> 23:20.259
into it so you're standing where your

23:20.259 --> 23:25.779
family walked 220 years ago I just got

23:25.779 --> 23:30.480
his shiver shiver in the 1970s there

23:30.480 --> 23:32.970
were two workers here when the province

23:32.970 --> 23:36.479
was doing the tours and they reached in

23:36.479 --> 23:39.320
to the foundation and they pulled out a

23:39.320 --> 23:43.730
bull chain a gold chain found at the

23:43.730 --> 23:47.220
site of the McGinnis foundation could it

23:47.220 --> 23:49.360
be possible evidence that Daniel

23:49.360 --> 23:51.640
McGinnis found something of value on Oak

23:51.640 --> 23:52.830
Island after all

23:52.830 --> 23:56.919
there's more questions and answers on

23:56.919 --> 23:58.559
Oak Island and obviously with with your

23:58.559 --> 23:59.679
family there's there's a lot of

23:59.679 --> 24:01.419
questions too that you don't have the

24:01.419 --> 24:05.769
answers to part of the history perhaps

24:05.769 --> 24:07.659
they will have recollections perhaps

24:07.659 --> 24:09.169
they will have remembrances I mean

24:09.169 --> 24:10.979
they've indicated to us that they grew

24:10.979 --> 24:13.860
up with stories of Oak Island and maybe

24:13.860 --> 24:17.419
there's some import that they bring back

24:17.419 --> 24:19.529
well here we are at the Oak Island is

24:19.529 --> 24:22.580
etre Center do you have any questions at

24:22.580 --> 24:25.509
all I would like to thank you for

24:25.509 --> 24:27.419
inviting us here and for everything

24:27.419 --> 24:29.840
you've done and I believe we

24:29.840 --> 24:32.809
collectively thank you now we have

24:32.809 --> 24:41.519
something to show you

24:41.519 --> 24:51.460
the reason why we're here is you ladies

24:51.460 --> 24:54.970
may take a unique offer that you had

24:54.970 --> 24:56.639
brought something to Oak Island brought

24:56.639 --> 24:57.940
something back which we're always

24:57.940 --> 25:01.090
fascinated with and we're anticipating

25:01.090 --> 25:02.759
that greatly I couldn't sleep last night

25:02.759 --> 25:04.539
and I was wondering what it is you're

25:04.539 --> 25:09.369
gonna bring to the table literally well

25:09.369 --> 25:12.440
it's my pleasure to show you while

25:12.440 --> 25:16.039
visiting Oak Island sisters Joan gene

25:16.039 --> 25:18.080
and Joyce McGinnis the direct

25:18.080 --> 25:20.399
descendants of the young man who first

25:20.399 --> 25:22.919
discovered the money pit back in 1795

25:22.919 --> 25:26.139
are about to share something incredible

25:26.139 --> 25:29.019
with Rick Marty and the Oak Island team

25:29.019 --> 25:32.929
see everyone start leaning in I'm

25:32.929 --> 25:34.309
sitting there thinking well could it be

25:34.309 --> 25:36.529
this could it be that isn't a story is

25:36.529 --> 25:38.549
it an artifact it what is it was like

25:38.549 --> 25:40.489
Christmas morning

25:40.489 --> 25:43.389
just the Box is very nice if it ends up

25:43.389 --> 25:45.340
about what they brought help solve the

25:45.340 --> 25:47.169
whole thing then you have the deal they

25:47.169 --> 25:49.269
used to say right men will write songs

25:49.269 --> 25:51.480
of this day

25:51.480 --> 25:53.320
you know the McGinnis sisters come back

25:53.320 --> 25:54.880
after 220 years and they bring the

25:54.880 --> 25:57.480
object that breaks the whole mystery

25:57.480 --> 25:59.919
into pieces you know starts with a

25:59.919 --> 26:01.869
McGinnis fittingly it might end with the

26:01.869 --> 26:08.289
McGinnis this is one of the stories we

26:08.289 --> 26:11.019
were told as children grandpa Daniel

26:11.019 --> 26:15.159
five generations ago he noticed the

26:15.159 --> 26:17.590
marks on the tree and being from a

26:17.590 --> 26:21.259
family of carpenters and Mason's he

26:21.259 --> 26:25.259
recognized the marks as the marks made

26:25.259 --> 26:27.999
by a pulley system and he noticed the

26:27.999 --> 26:31.009
depression in the ground so he and his

26:31.009 --> 26:34.489
two friends started digging they found

26:34.489 --> 26:38.499
some planks they kept digging now I've

26:38.499 --> 26:42.889
been told they found three treasure

26:42.889 --> 26:51.259
chests

26:51.259 --> 26:54.119
three treasure chests found by Daniel

26:54.119 --> 26:56.960
McGinnis and his two friends John Smith

26:56.960 --> 26:59.320
and Anthony Vaughn Walt digging in the

26:59.320 --> 27:03.239
money pit more than 200 years ago Daniel

27:03.239 --> 27:06.609
took one Smith took one and Vaughn took

27:06.609 --> 27:09.720
one and what is in this box

27:09.720 --> 27:12.330
is one of the things that came from that

27:12.330 --> 27:15.340
chest really the one that McGinnis -

27:15.340 --> 27:17.710
let's have a work

27:17.710 --> 27:18.889
my goodness

27:18.889 --> 27:40.669
that is quite extraordinary a gold cross

27:40.669 --> 27:44.690
found in the original money pit in 1795

27:44.690 --> 27:46.820
Daniel McGinnis finds this in the money

27:46.820 --> 27:49.229
pit I mean that's singularly impressive

27:49.229 --> 27:51.970
there's never been a find associated

27:51.970 --> 27:52.970
with the money pit there are there's

27:52.970 --> 27:55.619
stories of the little link of three

27:55.619 --> 27:57.779
links of gold chain can me up from with

27:57.779 --> 28:01.489
the pod augur but we're holding this in

28:01.489 --> 28:03.559
our hand and it's been passed down

28:03.559 --> 28:06.649
through multi-generationally I mean it

28:06.649 --> 28:09.409
it's incredible when you think about it

28:09.409 --> 28:11.300
so I got about a million questions that

28:11.300 --> 28:14.999
were to come from I mean who had it who

28:14.999 --> 28:17.269
gave it to who do you know how it passed

28:17.269 --> 28:20.909
down through 220 years it passed down to

28:20.909 --> 28:23.479
the McGinnis men they passed it down to

28:23.479 --> 28:27.190
their sons and so my father had it and

28:27.190 --> 28:30.580
when my brother James was fifteen my

28:30.580 --> 28:32.909
father passed it on to him and my

28:32.909 --> 28:34.789
brother of the night before he died he

28:34.789 --> 28:39.450
said never let this out of your sight

28:39.450 --> 28:44.729
Wow that was open your hand

28:44.729 --> 28:47.190
Wow that is extraordinary I mean have

28:47.190 --> 28:49.629
you tried to date it to analyze it find

28:49.629 --> 28:51.470
out where it's from is anybody has any

28:51.470 --> 28:54.779
experts have any experts looked at it I

28:54.779 --> 28:57.879
have taken it to several jewelers and

28:57.879 --> 29:01.169
I'm told that it could be as old as five

29:01.169 --> 29:04.859
hundred years old

29:04.859 --> 29:07.190
doesn't 500 years ago fit within our

29:07.190 --> 29:09.979
carbon dating that even be earlier than

29:09.979 --> 29:12.440
some of those things we'd seen so yeah

29:12.440 --> 29:14.210
that would definitely fit into any kind

29:14.210 --> 29:17.210
of theory if it's 500 or earlier mm-hmm

29:17.210 --> 29:19.509
if we can demonstrate that that came

29:19.509 --> 29:21.460
from Oak Island that's probably the most

29:21.460 --> 29:24.110
what is it is the most valuable thing to

29:24.110 --> 29:26.559
ever turn up out of this island right I

29:26.559 --> 29:29.409
mean that might be a huge clue I think

29:29.409 --> 29:32.289
so yeah I truly believe my grandma would

29:32.289 --> 29:34.710
say the treasure don't worry about the

29:34.710 --> 29:36.309
treasure the treasure will take care of

29:36.309 --> 29:37.679
itself

29:37.679 --> 29:40.099
but it will never be found until a

29:40.099 --> 29:47.179
McGinnis is back on the island for the

29:47.179 --> 29:49.480
laginas and their partners the gold

29:49.480 --> 29:52.249
cross represents what could very well be

29:52.249 --> 29:54.929
the first tangible evidence that objects

29:54.929 --> 29:57.320
of great value were buried at the money

29:57.320 --> 30:00.059
pit but more the three wooden treasure

30:00.059 --> 30:03.309
chests all that existed or were they

30:03.309 --> 30:05.120
placed there to discourage would-be

30:05.120 --> 30:08.109
treasure hunters digging I just want to

30:08.109 --> 30:09.999
say on behalf of all of us that we want

30:09.999 --> 30:11.609
to thank you for coming to Oak Island

30:11.609 --> 30:14.669
and for me personally you know it's not

30:14.669 --> 30:17.119
what you brought it's the fact that a

30:17.119 --> 30:18.880
piece of this storied history of Oak

30:18.880 --> 30:21.070
Island I'll come back the McGinnis

30:21.070 --> 30:24.009
family we started all this so from our

30:24.009 --> 30:26.539
hearts were very very grateful and it

30:26.539 --> 30:28.979
was wonderful to meet we appreciate it

30:28.979 --> 30:29.979
greatly

30:29.979 --> 30:31.539
put it this way this is energizing and

30:31.539 --> 30:33.009
it makes me want to keep going I mean

30:33.009 --> 30:34.809
we've had a bit of a dry spell here

30:34.809 --> 30:39.359
haven't we have yeah so thank you let's

30:39.359 --> 30:42.950
go let's go forth and conquer

30:42.950 --> 30:50.450
you

30:50.450 --> 30:52.270
maybe just park over here and then he

30:52.270 --> 30:54.600
can go in shortly after their incredible

30:54.600 --> 30:57.429
meeting with the three McGinnis sisters

30:57.429 --> 31:00.159
and seen the antique gold cross that was

31:00.159 --> 31:02.419
reportedly found by their ancestor more

31:02.419 --> 31:05.980
than 200 years ago Rick lagina along

31:05.980 --> 31:08.179
with Dave Blankenship and Charles

31:08.179 --> 31:11.299
Barkhouse returned to the money pit site

31:11.299 --> 31:14.029
if anything Rick is more convinced than

31:14.029 --> 31:17.039
ever that he and the team are finally on

31:17.039 --> 31:19.719
the verge of a major breakthrough it's

31:19.719 --> 31:29.440
that far hold one last week while

31:29.440 --> 31:31.389
drilling just north of the area where

31:31.389 --> 31:33.429
they had found evidence of a mysterious

31:33.429 --> 31:35.779
wooden vault Rick lagina

31:35.779 --> 31:38.320
Charles Barkhouse and well driller

31:38.320 --> 31:41.440
Jordan Rogers discovered an incredible

31:41.440 --> 31:44.389
21 foot tall void deep beneath

31:44.389 --> 31:47.859
twenty-one feet

31:47.859 --> 31:53.210
while using an evacuation system to pump

31:53.210 --> 31:55.409
sediments out of the recently discovered

31:55.409 --> 31:58.989
boy jack begley found a mysterious

31:58.989 --> 32:03.450
albeit tiny metal object see the sheen

32:03.450 --> 32:09.359
there and and then there's very true

32:09.359 --> 32:12.309
because the presence of a 21-foot deep

32:12.309 --> 32:15.100
void is unusual even by oak island

32:15.100 --> 32:18.169
standards Rick lagina has hired pipe

32:18.169 --> 32:20.619
inspection specialist Glen Cornell to

32:20.619 --> 32:22.950
conduct a more thorough investigation of

32:22.950 --> 32:25.969
the hole that's what 200 192 is the

32:25.969 --> 32:31.529
bottom okay

32:31.529 --> 32:34.929
Glenn is using the P 340 flex a probe a

32:34.929 --> 32:37.339
camera specifically designed for use in

32:37.339 --> 32:40.350
pipe inspection with a maneuverable head

32:40.350 --> 32:42.649
the probe will be able to see in every

32:42.649 --> 32:43.679
direction

32:43.679 --> 32:46.230
#NOME?

32:46.230 --> 32:48.370
structures such as a vault lie in the

32:48.370 --> 32:51.360
large void below Glenn has also

32:51.360 --> 32:53.379
fashioned a died light to the camera

32:53.379 --> 32:55.669
head in order to maximize visibility

32:55.669 --> 33:01.210
perfect tech here we go

33:01.210 --> 33:04.599
soon they said this yeah that's nice

33:04.599 --> 33:06.320
let's see what it looks like in the

33:06.320 --> 33:07.320
water

33:07.320 --> 33:13.130
yeah we're just a boat in the water here

33:13.130 --> 33:16.429
let's see what we got here

33:16.429 --> 33:19.960
it's looking pretty milky Wow that just

33:19.960 --> 33:20.960
not look good

33:20.960 --> 33:23.489
that's just a yeah whenever you're

33:23.489 --> 33:25.120
running equipment like that you know you

33:25.120 --> 33:26.929
run a visual camera sonar device

33:26.929 --> 33:28.909
anything what you're hoping for every

33:28.909 --> 33:31.139
time is that wow look at that

33:31.139 --> 33:34.140
it's a doubloon or it's a you know at

33:34.140 --> 33:38.029
the aha moment yeah it's definitely

33:38.029 --> 33:40.929
clear right now if there's not clear

33:40.929 --> 33:42.989
enough to see my gold bar though there's

33:42.989 --> 33:49.289
a shiny gold by approaching 50 meters

33:49.289 --> 33:51.849
right now okay that's a cavity right

33:51.849 --> 33:54.299
there I'm thinking I mean a cavity

33:54.299 --> 33:58.559
they're not six feet in suddenly Rick

33:58.559 --> 34:00.899
and the team discovers something strange

34:00.899 --> 34:02.960
embedded in the wall of the underground

34:02.960 --> 34:05.989
cavern what's that

34:05.989 --> 34:13.090
that curve thing not the casing visit

34:13.090 --> 34:17.370
that right there yeah looks like it

34:17.370 --> 34:20.460
might be what is that a shiny metallic

34:20.460 --> 34:23.480
object embedded in the wall of a void

34:23.480 --> 34:29.100
171 feet deep below the ground there's

34:29.100 --> 34:31.590
another piece

34:31.590 --> 34:39.420
it's your gold colors you'd almost see a

34:39.420 --> 34:41.260
little bit of gold you know that

34:41.260 --> 34:44.280
shouldn't be in the United could rake in

34:44.280 --> 34:46.719
the team really be looking at a piece of

34:46.719 --> 34:49.659
treasure inside the actual money pit

34:49.659 --> 34:53.960
here's my thought he confirms in my mind

34:53.960 --> 34:56.080
several things one is there is indeed a

34:56.080 --> 34:58.800
cavity there and it's 21 feet of open

34:58.800 --> 35:00.470
hole I mean there's something going on

35:00.470 --> 35:01.470
down there

35:01.470 --> 35:03.750
we did get the other piece of metal over

35:03.750 --> 35:07.120
here too which is extremely curious you

35:07.120 --> 35:09.320
know the metal thing the shiny thing

35:09.320 --> 35:11.640
we'll call it yeah that's curious

35:11.640 --> 35:13.080
there's no other way to describe it

35:13.080 --> 35:14.620
because we don't know what it is but

35:14.620 --> 35:15.620
it's definitely there

35:15.620 --> 35:18.510
having now discovered compelling

35:18.510 --> 35:21.300
evidence that something of great value

35:21.300 --> 35:23.850
really could be buried deep inside the

35:23.850 --> 35:26.480
money pit Rick lagina knows there is

35:26.480 --> 35:29.060
only one way to be sure

35:29.060 --> 35:31.590
he and his partners will have to dig an

35:31.590 --> 35:34.820
enormous hole some 18 stories

35:34.820 --> 35:37.930
underground but such a project will

35:37.930 --> 35:40.620
present both an engineering challenge

35:40.620 --> 35:43.410
and a financial one costing in the

35:43.410 --> 35:44.590
millions of dollars

35:44.590 --> 35:47.360
okay well here's the thing there's no

35:47.360 --> 35:49.150
way we can walk away from this now we've

35:49.150 --> 35:50.630
got the little piece of metal we've got

35:50.630 --> 35:53.270
this strange and mysterious object we

35:53.270 --> 35:55.430
cannot write this hole off there's no

35:55.430 --> 35:58.290
way to put an X in this hole no no I

35:58.290 --> 36:00.881
mean at this point I think we're all

36:00.881 --> 36:02.510
puzzling what to do next

36:02.510 --> 36:04.630
it's an engineer's dilemma is really

36:04.630 --> 36:07.450
what it is it's not that simple thank

36:07.450 --> 36:12.609
you but as much as we're gonna see

36:12.609 --> 36:15.000
although Rick lagina must soon leave Oak

36:15.000 --> 36:17.270
Island due to the certainty of another

36:17.270 --> 36:20.650
harsh North Atlantic winter he has found

36:21.650 --> 36:23.560
the evidence he needs to justify a major

36:24.560 --> 36:27.050
excavation in the money pit but now

36:27.050 --> 36:28.600
another question still remains

36:28.600 --> 36:31.820
will he be able to persuade his brother

36:31.820 --> 36:43.330
Marty and their partners to agree with

36:43.330 --> 36:45.200
him

36:45.200 --> 36:47.060
you

36:47.060 --> 36:50.820
after an incredible year that has been

36:50.820 --> 36:53.770
full of both setbacks and breakthroughs

36:53.770 --> 36:58.030
Rick Marty and their partners have

36:58.030 --> 37:00.600
gathered to meet in the war room before

37:00.600 --> 37:01.800
they must head back home

37:01.800 --> 37:03.950
to wait out another Oak Island winter

37:03.950 --> 37:07.680
okay guys let's talk about this year

37:07.680 --> 37:09.340
let's talk about what we did where we're

37:09.340 --> 37:11.080
going how everybody feels about the

37:11.080 --> 37:14.390
quest we're all here we were energized

37:14.390 --> 37:16.400
by the cross and the McGinnis sisters

37:16.400 --> 37:17.970
come in here that was really kind of

37:17.970 --> 37:21.160
cool you know seeing an item pulled from

37:21.160 --> 37:22.160
the money pit

37:22.160 --> 37:24.500
it's exciting it's invigorating the

37:24.500 --> 37:26.320
cross was just fantastic that's really

37:26.320 --> 37:28.410
cool and it's been in the family all

37:28.410 --> 37:31.320
these years yeah there's something kind

37:31.320 --> 37:34.900
of epic and Shakespearean and destiny

37:34.900 --> 37:37.460
about them coming back here 220 years

37:37.460 --> 37:39.720
later and bringing the only significant

37:39.720 --> 37:42.660
thing of value perhaps that was I guess

37:42.660 --> 37:45.910
volunteer so where do we go next

37:45.910 --> 37:48.090
what do you think about the money put no

37:48.090 --> 37:50.600
question about it I want to continue

37:50.600 --> 37:52.620
period we now have access to new

37:52.620 --> 37:55.750
information and I want to find out

37:55.750 --> 37:56.750
definitively

37:56.750 --> 37:58.470
is there something in there not in

37:58.470 --> 38:00.900
theirs discovery processes that remain

38:00.900 --> 38:03.580
to be done well and also to have a

38:03.580 --> 38:06.010
success and know once and for all there

38:06.010 --> 38:08.010
is man-made stuff down there it kind of

38:08.010 --> 38:10.500
comes down to us proving it and really

38:10.500 --> 38:13.540
do the archeological thick and go foot

38:13.540 --> 38:16.940
by foot uncover what the money pit holds

38:16.940 --> 38:21.780
so we can solve the mystery for gate

38:21.780 --> 38:23.330
okay I don't hear a lot of enthusiasm

38:23.330 --> 38:25.220
for quitting from that sector no not at

38:25.220 --> 38:26.220
all

38:26.220 --> 38:28.660
okay what else for me a big disappoint

38:28.660 --> 38:31.630
was John Chatterton not being able to

38:31.630 --> 38:34.240
find anything in the cavity I'm not

38:34.240 --> 38:36.010
writing it off though because you know

38:36.010 --> 38:38.280
there's still two or three feet of silt

38:38.280 --> 38:40.650
on quite a bit of the cavity that you

38:40.650 --> 38:42.240
know he can't just dig his arms in there

38:42.240 --> 38:45.060
and find you know a shovel a chest or

38:45.060 --> 38:47.960
whatever so I think we next year we got

38:47.960 --> 38:50.330
to come back and clean that cavity out

38:50.330 --> 38:54.880
well you know I'm all for 10x now it's

38:54.880 --> 38:56.810
time to get down there in the drive so

38:56.810 --> 38:58.840
let's pump it out and we'll get down

38:58.840 --> 39:04.570
there and we can see what's there David

39:04.570 --> 39:06.160
we did make progress it's not the

39:06.160 --> 39:08.230
progress that I will hope for it's not

39:08.230 --> 39:10.370
the progress I have anticipated but it

39:10.370 --> 39:11.370
is progress

39:11.370 --> 39:14.940
it has taken 220 years to get to this

39:14.940 --> 39:17.370
point but it's been a good year because

39:17.370 --> 39:19.170
there is a year to come

39:19.170 --> 39:27.070
it'll be the 221st year well said you

39:27.070 --> 39:29.000
know what comes down to a vote

39:29.000 --> 39:30.840
it's the Fellowship of the dig everyone

39:30.840 --> 39:34.561
has a singular vote and I'd like to see

39:34.561 --> 39:37.420
hands in the air do we continue or do we

39:37.420 --> 39:46.750
not

39:46.750 --> 39:48.250
I vote yes

39:48.250 --> 39:53.240
yes yes I gotta say an aye vote yes that

39:53.240 --> 39:58.070
leaves you I vote yes

39:58.070 --> 40:03.800
we move forward Big Brother

40:03.800 --> 40:14.890
let's go cron time crime time is right

40:14.890 --> 40:17.560
another search for answers on Oak Island

40:17.560 --> 40:20.500
has come to a temporary end

40:20.500 --> 40:24.700
after a year that saw a series of

40:24.700 --> 40:28.920
incredible discoveries amazing we have

40:28.920 --> 40:32.030
found it the formation of strategic

40:32.030 --> 40:35.100
partnerships welcome to the team and

40:35.100 --> 40:38.270
several important questions being asked

40:38.270 --> 40:40.740
is this accomplishment is it doable and

40:40.740 --> 40:43.200
answered but it looks metallic your gold

40:43.200 --> 40:47.610
colors yeah that's definitely there

40:47.610 --> 40:50.600
Rick Marty and their partners realized

40:50.600 --> 40:53.160
they have come too close and gone too

40:53.160 --> 40:55.520
far to stop now

40:55.520 --> 40:59.570
if anything they are leaving the island

40:59.570 --> 41:03.660
with a greater commitment to return than

41:03.660 --> 41:07.160
ever before

41:07.160 --> 41:09.410
it's perseverance but often solve

41:09.410 --> 41:10.780
something like this

41:10.780 --> 41:12.970
it's perseverance that often carries the

41:12.970 --> 41:14.660
day and all kinds of human endeavors

41:14.660 --> 41:19.300
it's like Edison said when they asked

41:19.300 --> 41:21.460
him if he thought he'd failed he said no

41:21.460 --> 41:23.380
it's not failed I've found 462 things

41:23.380 --> 41:26.510
that don't work and he's right that that

41:26.510 --> 41:27.510
matters

41:27.510 --> 41:30.060
here will come the Sun will rise spring

41:30.060 --> 41:33.620
will arrive and we'll be back and oh God

41:33.620 --> 41:47.151
you know we'll finish what we set out to

41:47.151 --> 41:48.151
do

41:48.151 --> 41:49.390
if it's gonna be done I put odds on him

41:49.390 --> 41:50.410
we're not giving up together

41:50.410 --> 41:52.250
who else you gonna bet on go ahead try

41:52.250 --> 41:53.980
will persevere on this and we'll find

41:53.980 --> 41:55.530
out what this island has to say you
