-[high-pitched buzzing]
-[screams]

03:30.669 --> 03:34.256
[woman, in English] Oh, come on, now.
Ain't all bad, hon.

03:34.840 --> 03:37.301
Think about all the time
you'll get to spend with me.

03:43.015 --> 03:45.392
It ain't the end, darling.

03:48.395 --> 03:49.479
[man clears throat]

03:49.563 --> 03:52.900
Be careful out there today.
If you die, I'll kill your ass.

03:52.983 --> 03:56.570
I get more money from your retirement
than survival benefits.

03:59.448 --> 04:00.908
[sighs]

04:00.991 --> 04:03.452
[man on radio] And what are we
talking about here, really?

04:04.036 --> 04:06.288
God is good.

04:06.872 --> 04:12.920
His righteous plan is to provide you hope
to light your way forward.

04:13.504 --> 04:15.214
I share with you today from Romans.

04:15.297 --> 04:19.051
This is a good one, 'cause we're talking
here about your future.

04:19.134 --> 04:21.887
[people chattering]

04:24.431 --> 04:25.641
[man] Look at that.

04:26.808 --> 04:29.394
-I ain't even cold yet.
-[woman chuckles] You gotta sign these.

04:58.090 --> 05:00.676
[woman knocks] Sheriff Tyson's last day.

05:01.343 --> 05:02.553
Hmm.

05:02.636 --> 05:04.763
They trying to make you disappear already.

05:05.597 --> 05:06.682
Shit.

05:08.183 --> 05:10.060
[inhales]

05:10.143 --> 05:14.648
Well, Ben Shelton called.
His phone was cutting in and out,

05:14.731 --> 05:17.651
but he said something about
his mama's truck being stolen.

05:19.695 --> 05:20.696
[sighs]

05:22.281 --> 05:23.407
Well, all right.

05:32.749 --> 05:34.918
[mooing]

05:39.840 --> 05:41.550
-[crows cawing]
-[mooing continues]

05:45.470 --> 05:49.641
They some goddamn meth heads, I tell ya.
They stole Mama's car.

05:49.725 --> 05:50.726
Who?

05:51.435 --> 05:53.645
[Ben] My inbred nephews, that's who.

05:54.271 --> 05:55.314
Cal and Chet?

05:55.397 --> 05:56.899
How you so sure it was them?

05:56.982 --> 05:59.693
I deduced it after they done it
three times before.

06:01.987 --> 06:06.283
All right. Grady, tell Tammy
to put a BOLO alert out on the truck,

06:06.366 --> 06:09.745
and tell Suthers to pick up them boys,
bring 'em in.

06:09.828 --> 06:13.332
You ain't gonna just find 'em. [sighs]
They ain't at their trailer.

06:13.916 --> 06:18.378
I ring the A&P,
Trevor said they ain't show up for work.

06:19.171 --> 06:22.633
I call Chet's PO, Chet missed
his weekly piss test this morning.

06:23.967 --> 06:25.969
Boys ain't nowhere to next Tuesday.

06:28.889 --> 06:31.600
I bet my life it's got something to do

06:31.683 --> 06:34.561
with Fulton's dipshit son
they're mixed up with.

06:36.855 --> 06:37.856
Well… [clears throat]

06:39.066 --> 06:41.026
…I'm sure they'll turn up sooner or later.

06:42.194 --> 06:45.322
[Ben] Ten years ago you'd have had
every deputy on a thing like this.

06:45.822 --> 06:47.032
A stolen truck.

06:47.115 --> 06:49.826
Now, all of a sudden,
it's just a drop in the bucket.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.411
[cawing continues]

06:53.705 --> 06:54.915
Ain't right, Jim Bell.

06:55.999 --> 06:57.960
Desperation's done something to this town.

07:03.465 --> 07:05.050
[Grady] What is it, Sheriff?

07:14.393 --> 07:15.394
[Grady] Sheriff?

07:16.645 --> 07:18.522
[Ben] That thing ain't sturdy, Jim Bell.

07:34.329 --> 07:35.831
[panting]

08:27.883 --> 08:29.593
How did you get so big?

08:30.177 --> 08:33.054
I think it's a combination
of food and sleep.

08:34.515 --> 08:36.433
So can I go back to sleep?

08:37.267 --> 08:39.019
Yes. Yes. Sure.

08:40.062 --> 08:43.106
After you get dressed,
have breakfast, go to school…

08:43.190 --> 08:44.399
[both shout, chuckle]

08:44.483 --> 08:47.361
…come back home, do your chores,
do your homework

08:48.111 --> 08:50.030
and give your mother a kiss good night.

08:50.113 --> 08:52.032
-No, no!
-You can't hide from the tickle monster.

08:52.115 --> 08:53.492
-No!
-You can't hide.

08:53.575 --> 08:55.786
-You can't--
-[laughing]

08:55.869 --> 08:57.287
Good morning, my love.

08:58.288 --> 09:00.791
You know who else is still sleeping?

09:03.293 --> 09:04.461
Come on.

09:04.545 --> 09:07.005
-[girl shouts, laughs]
-[boy growls]

09:07.923 --> 09:10.717
-[girl] Wake up, monster. [chuckling]
-[groans]

09:12.594 --> 09:16.849
You know what the monster does
when he's disturbed from his slumber?

09:16.932 --> 09:18.517
-What?
-Uh-oh.

09:18.600 --> 09:20.936
-He breathes…
-Uh-oh.

09:21.019 --> 09:26.316
-…fire with his morning breath!
-[children chuckling]

09:26.942 --> 09:28.944
-[growling] I got you.
-[laughing]

09:31.530 --> 09:33.782
-No! No.
-What do you think? Shall I eat them?

09:33.866 --> 09:34.950
-Definitely.
-[girl] No!

09:35.033 --> 09:36.577
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

09:36.660 --> 09:38.745
-Come here, then. Come here.
-Oh, no!

09:38.829 --> 09:42.040
-You will also be kissed and eaten by me!
-[laughing] No!

09:42.124 --> 09:46.086
-I'll eat you! I'll eat you!
-[girl laughing] No! No! No!

09:46.170 --> 09:47.671
[shower water running]

09:54.261 --> 09:59.349
[in Japanese]
I'm going to miss the sunrise.

10:08.483 --> 10:10.485
[water continues running]

10:41.058 --> 10:44.436
[woman] I know you hate doing this.

10:46.939 --> 10:48.023
So, I love you.

11:38.949 --> 11:40.784
Are you nervous?

11:43.036 --> 11:44.830
Nervous? [sighs]

11:50.711 --> 11:55.090
[driver] What do you think
you'll miss the most?

11:58.594 --> 11:59.595
[sighs]

12:00.762 --> 12:03.182
The weight of things.

12:08.937 --> 12:12.191
[applause]

12:13.108 --> 12:14.610
[shutter clicking]

12:19.239 --> 12:23.827
We couldn't be more honored
and humbled to be venturing

12:23.911 --> 12:27.748
to the International Space Station
for the next year. [inhales]

12:27.831 --> 12:33.420
This will be one of
the longest recorded stays on the ISS.

12:34.129 --> 12:37.591
And, as such, one of the tenets
of our mission

12:37.674 --> 12:40.677
is to study the effects
of long-term space travel

12:40.761 --> 12:42.679
on the human body,

12:43.514 --> 12:46.642
essential intelligence we need in order

12:46.725 --> 12:52.397
to plan longer missions to Mars
and deep space.

12:53.106 --> 12:54.608
[applause]

12:56.610 --> 12:59.404
[man] Why would Murai-san
date Meguru Seki?

12:59.488 --> 13:01.907
She could have any guy in the world.

13:03.033 --> 13:04.368
Even you.

13:05.118 --> 13:08.747
I mean, he's not even a good actor.
[chuckles]

13:10.249 --> 13:12.960
Did you see Emperor Hit Man 3?

13:13.043 --> 13:14.628
It was awful.

13:14.711 --> 13:16.713
Maybe the sex is good.

13:16.797 --> 13:19.883
Well… it can't be that good.

13:19.967 --> 13:23.053
She's going 400 kilometers
away from Earth.

13:30.519 --> 13:32.187
Hey, what are you doing?

13:33.438 --> 13:37.150
You put the black stone here, the computer
will go over here, so you go there.

13:37.234 --> 13:38.485
Then the computer will try here.

13:38.569 --> 13:39.736
Black stone goes here.

13:39.820 --> 13:41.405
And a win!

13:43.198 --> 13:44.408
You're an asshole.

13:48.954 --> 13:51.039
Yamato-san, we need you.

13:51.123 --> 13:52.457
I'm almost done.

13:52.541 --> 13:53.834
[man] We need you now.

13:57.629 --> 14:00.048
I'll stay here then.

14:00.132 --> 14:03.510
It seems that one of the backup comms
is nonresponsive.

14:11.643 --> 14:12.728
Captain Murai.

14:13.437 --> 14:16.940
This is Mitsuki Yamato, Communications.

14:18.358 --> 14:19.902
[Murai] Have we met somewhere?

14:20.611 --> 14:21.987
No.

14:23.238 --> 14:24.406
Are you sure?

14:24.489 --> 14:26.074
You look familiar.

14:26.992 --> 14:29.161
Yamato-san will run a quick diagnostic.

14:39.922 --> 14:40.923
[sighs]

14:43.509 --> 14:47.012
In the unlikely event
that comms are ever down,

14:47.095 --> 14:49.681
I will set up a viral downshift.

14:49.765 --> 14:52.768
It will transmit a message to the ISS.

14:53.810 --> 14:56.688
That will get you back up and running
in no time.

14:58.565 --> 15:00.901
It always takes a woman
to get the job done.

15:07.241 --> 15:09.576
Okay, running the test.

15:11.828 --> 15:13.372
Look at the monitor, please.

15:17.501 --> 15:18.961
Can you see me?

15:20.379 --> 15:21.338
I see you.

15:23.632 --> 15:25.259
How's the picture?

15:27.052 --> 15:28.178
Perfect.

15:32.724 --> 15:33.892
Can you hear me?

15:36.144 --> 15:37.187
Yes.

15:40.941 --> 15:41.942
[whispers] And now?

15:43.610 --> 15:44.653
Yes.

15:46.822 --> 15:50.909
[whispering softer] And at this frequency,

15:50.993 --> 15:52.953
can you make out what I'm saying?

15:54.371 --> 15:55.998
I'll miss…

16:00.210 --> 16:05.382
"I'll miss… the sunrise."

16:10.387 --> 16:11.388
[man] All good?

16:13.348 --> 16:15.475
Yes, fine.

16:31.074 --> 16:32.201
[sighs deeply]

17:10.614 --> 17:14.242
[in English] The hell happened here?
Little meth lab explosion?

17:15.661 --> 17:19.498
What, you think they had a meth lab
in the center of a corn field?

17:20.165 --> 17:23.502
I once saw a meth lab
in the middle of a Chuck E. Cheese's.

17:24.545 --> 17:26.255
Nothing surprises me no more.

17:26.338 --> 17:27.422
I don't think so.

17:28.966 --> 17:29.967
This looks--

17:31.552 --> 17:33.095
This looks by design.

17:37.683 --> 17:38.684
Well, look at that.

17:55.909 --> 17:57.578
[Grady] Tire treads seem fresh enough.

17:58.453 --> 18:01.957
Still got a little cool left.
Half-day old, I reckon.

18:02.040 --> 18:06.670
They got high, wrecked Mama's truck.
Tried to, what?

18:08.046 --> 18:11.884
Bury the evidence, ran off?
Knew their mama would beat their ass?

18:12.551 --> 18:14.094
And just left this here?

18:14.178 --> 18:15.387
-No.
-[insects buzzing]

18:16.680 --> 18:17.806
Sheriff?

18:18.432 --> 18:20.058
[locusts buzzing]

18:27.274 --> 18:28.317
Sheriff!

18:28.400 --> 18:29.693
Sheriff!

18:32.738 --> 18:33.739
Come on, now.

18:35.532 --> 18:37.534

-[mother] Sweetie.

20:06.748 --> 20:11.461
Sweetheart. Sweetie. It's okay. It's okay.
It's all right. Mommy's here.

20:11.545 --> 20:13.422
-Mom!
-Luke! Luke!

20:14.298 --> 20:16.383
[gasps] Look at me.

20:16.466 --> 20:18.427
-What happened?
-We don't know yet.

20:18.510 --> 20:20.971
There was kids who just--
They got some bloody noses.

20:21.054 --> 20:24.224
And he was the only one
it didn't happen to.

20:24.308 --> 20:27.352
It could be asbestos or lead.
The CDC's on their way.

20:27.436 --> 20:30.939
In the meantime, everyone is being advised
to evacuate the school immediately.

20:32.107 --> 20:35.152
Okay, just follow me.
Just follow me. Mommy's here.

20:35.235 --> 20:38.363
Just follow me.
It's all right, sweetie. It's all right.

21:37.339 --> 21:38.841
The fuck you retards doing here?

21:39.424 --> 21:41.218
[Jim Bell] You miss us, boy?

21:41.301 --> 21:44.346
I don't see a warrant.
So you can't bust us for jack shit, man.

21:44.429 --> 21:46.723
We're after Cal and Chet Griffin.

21:47.307 --> 21:48.308
Who?

21:49.810 --> 21:51.311
We paid a visit to their camper.

21:51.395 --> 21:55.232
We know you were at their trailer,
banging and screaming for 'em.

21:55.315 --> 21:56.316
You trying to collect?

21:56.900 --> 21:58.318
I was here all night, man.

21:58.902 --> 22:02.030
You got… seven witnesses to corroborate.

22:03.198 --> 22:04.783
How much money did Cal owe ya?

22:06.702 --> 22:08.036
Who the fuck is that?

22:12.374 --> 22:13.750
You know, it's funny, man.

22:14.334 --> 22:17.171
My daddy always used to have a good laugh
when he'd see you coming,

22:17.254 --> 22:19.590
your little siren going. [chuckles]

22:20.424 --> 22:24.178
"What is the fucking point of him?"
he'd say. [sniffs]

22:24.261 --> 22:27.931
Oh, and now look at ya. You're old too.

22:29.391 --> 22:31.768
-Sad.

-[Jim Bell] Where are they?
-I don't fucking know, man.

22:38.192 --> 22:40.360
We didn't touch them hillbillies,
all right?

22:41.445 --> 22:43.280
You're looking in all the wrong places.

22:43.363 --> 22:45.407
Them boys is hated
both sides of the Mississippi.

22:46.575 --> 22:49.912
They were always scheming.
[chuckles] Him and his whore girl.

22:49.995 --> 22:52.247
[panting]

22:53.081 --> 22:54.583
[grunting]

22:59.254 --> 23:02.716
Look, the world's better off without 'em.
[panting]

23:03.634 --> 23:07.262
That lying motherfucker
was supposed to take me with him.

23:07.346 --> 23:08.555
[Grady] Take you with him?

23:10.182 --> 23:11.558
To Mexico.

23:12.851 --> 23:16.104
Cal and his dipshit brother
run up a tab all over the state,

23:16.188 --> 23:18.732
and they was all collecting.
Not just Daniel.

23:18.815 --> 23:19.816
No.

23:21.360 --> 23:25.614
He was taken.
They both were. And I'm gonna find 'em.

23:25.697 --> 23:28.075
[woman] They wasn't taken.
Just another scam.

23:28.867 --> 23:30.953
It's always something
with that piece of shit.

23:32.996 --> 23:34.790
Big ol' crooked ideas.

23:35.707 --> 23:37.000
-Look, I-- [sighs]
-Mmm.

23:37.084 --> 23:40.963
I don't know what you think this is,
but this is what they do.

23:41.046 --> 23:42.714
They fuck with people.

23:42.798 --> 23:46.051
-You don't know what you're talking about.
-This was the plan all along.

23:46.134 --> 23:47.803
He ran the fuck off.

23:48.554 --> 23:49.596
Just doesn't square.

23:49.680 --> 23:52.808
Ain't you been listening?
This ain't some big mystery.

23:53.392 --> 23:57.062
These boys can't do but one thing,
and they already gone and done it.

23:57.145 --> 23:58.730
They're just gone.

24:03.777 --> 24:05.988
[breathing shakily]

24:09.533 --> 24:10.701
You all right, Sheriff?

24:14.872 --> 24:15.873
Yeah.

24:17.958 --> 24:18.959
I'm fine.

24:25.591 --> 24:27.926
[line ringing]

24:28.010 --> 24:30.345
Hi, you've reached Manny.
Please leave a message.

24:30.429 --> 24:32.222
-[beeps]
-I know you're in a pitch, hon.

24:32.306 --> 24:33.682
Just call me whenever you can.

24:34.683 --> 24:36.185
[siren wailing]

24:47.196 --> 24:51.533
Hospitals scare me.
People get sick in hospitals.

24:51.617 --> 24:54.995
[mother] My love, that's not right.
Hospitals are where people get healthy.

24:55.829 --> 24:59.291
Just try to breathe slowly for me.
It'll help you.

24:59.374 --> 25:01.710
Breathe in. [inhales] Out. [exhales]

25:01.793 --> 25:04.630
In. Out. Good.

25:04.713 --> 25:05.923
I can't.

25:06.798 --> 25:08.258
I'm too scared.

25:08.342 --> 25:09.343
[mother] Okay.

25:09.927 --> 25:12.054
Tell me this. Mmm, how old are you?

25:12.804 --> 25:14.056
You know how old I am.

25:14.139 --> 25:15.766
Yes, I do. Six.

25:15.849 --> 25:20.145
One, two, three, four, five, six.
One candle for every year.

25:20.229 --> 25:24.858
Now, I want you to take a deep breath
and blow out each candle one by one. Okay?

25:24.942 --> 25:26.944
-[breathing deeply]
-One. Good.

25:27.694 --> 25:29.279
Two. Good.

25:30.239 --> 25:31.448
That's my girl.

25:32.533 --> 25:33.617
Good.

25:34.117 --> 25:35.827
Make a wish on this last one.

25:36.328 --> 25:39.623
How you guys doing in here?
Hi, I'm Dr. Lockhart.

25:40.332 --> 25:42.417
You must be Luke.

25:42.501 --> 25:44.127
No bloody nose for you, huh?

25:44.628 --> 25:45.921
And Sarah?

25:46.004 --> 25:49.925
Like the princess in A Little Princess,
only spelled with an H.

25:50.425 --> 25:52.052
[Dr. Lockhart]
Heard about this on the news.

25:52.135 --> 25:56.181
I also heard from my nurse that you
performed a radial bifurcation in the car?

25:56.265 --> 25:57.641
Posterior and anterior.

25:57.724 --> 26:00.894
Saw some inflammation,
but it's just probably from swimming.

26:00.978 --> 26:04.231
That was a dangerous thing to do in a car.
You a doctor?

26:04.314 --> 26:07.359
No. Yes, I went to medical school.

26:07.901 --> 26:09.111
Which med school?

26:09.194 --> 26:10.737
Harvard. You?

26:12.406 --> 26:13.949
Hofstra. Anyway.

26:14.783 --> 26:20.831
I can tell you the tests came back normal.
Vitals, mucus, saliva. All healthy.

26:20.914 --> 26:24.835
Just a little nosebleed.
I know they can be scary sometimes.

26:24.918 --> 26:26.753
How come nothing bad happened to me?

26:28.088 --> 26:30.674
[Dr. Lockhart]
I guess that would make you the lucky one.

26:30.757 --> 26:33.385
Get plenty of rest and fluids
for the next day or so.

26:34.011 --> 26:35.262
[mother] Thank you, Doctor.

26:36.221 --> 26:37.222
So we're okay?

26:38.348 --> 26:39.433
[mother] You're fine.

26:40.517 --> 26:42.394
-Mommy?
-Yes, my love?

26:43.353 --> 26:44.521
My wish came true.

26:45.272 --> 26:47.274
[happy music playing on television]

26:50.068 --> 26:51.987
-[Luke] Thank you.
-[Sarah] You're welcome.

26:52.779 --> 26:55.616
Here you go, Mommy.
I made special tea for you.

26:55.699 --> 26:59.203
[chuckles] Come here.
Cuddle. Cuddle, cuddle, cuddle.

26:59.286 --> 27:00.495
[groans]

27:03.373 --> 27:05.125
-[electrical buzzing]
-[Sarah gasps]

27:07.920 --> 27:09.254
[Luke] What's going on?

27:09.338 --> 27:11.256
[mother]
It's all right. The power just went out.

27:11.340 --> 27:12.633
[Luke] But it's not raining.

27:13.509 --> 27:14.718
[electrical buzzing]

27:15.302 --> 27:18.305
-[alarm beeping]
-[news reporter speaking German]

27:20.516 --> 27:22.017
Is Dad still in the city?

27:29.316 --> 27:30.984
[Sarah] That's not the city.

27:33.862 --> 27:35.239
Where's Daddy?

27:42.454 --> 27:43.580
[line ringing]

27:43.664 --> 27:46.458
Hi, you've reached Manny.
Please leave a message.

27:48.418 --> 27:51.255
[man on speaker, in Japanese] Taking off
in T-minus 17 seconds and counting.

27:51.755 --> 27:56.468
Fifteen, fourteen, thirteen, twelve,

eleven, ten, nine, eight,

28:01.181 --> 28:04.101

28:04.726 --> 28:08.355
four, three, two, one.

28:08.438 --> 28:10.148

28:10.232 --> 28:13.318

and liftoff of the Hoshi-12.

29:18.759 --> 29:21.720
["Angel of Death" playing on radio]

29:21.803 --> 29:23.931
[Grady]
You always said to never ask after you.

29:25.474 --> 29:28.644
After all these years, I never have,
and I ain't gonna start.

29:30.562 --> 29:34.483
But if there was a day that called for it,
today'd be it.

29:39.655 --> 29:41.990
See… [breathes deeply]

29:42.074 --> 29:47.496
just as men of the robe are chosen by God,
so are men of the badge.

29:48.705 --> 29:52.251
Over the course of a lawman's life,
he comes to understand why.

29:52.751 --> 29:54.545
Why he was chosen.

29:55.170 --> 29:59.091
Sometimes it's many things.
Most times it's just one.

29:59.758 --> 30:00.759
One case.

30:02.094 --> 30:04.096
One reason we're put on this Earth.

30:05.806 --> 30:06.807
But me?

30:09.560 --> 30:12.145
After all these years,
after all this time,

30:13.772 --> 30:15.148
what I really done?

30:18.819 --> 30:20.362
You done lots of things.

30:21.196 --> 30:22.197
[sniffs]

30:23.782 --> 30:26.577
I worked this case once,
way before your time.

30:27.077 --> 30:30.372
My daddy was still alive
and barely hanging on though he was.

30:31.623 --> 30:36.670
Anyways, this little girl, Gracie Clarke,
goes missing from the church fair.

30:36.753 --> 30:38.213
Not six years old.

30:39.798 --> 30:44.553
Now, I thought that
this Gracie Clarke business

30:44.636 --> 30:48.265
was gonna be my-- my case, my reason.

30:50.100 --> 30:52.102
I pieced together a few things,

30:52.686 --> 30:55.981
but I found myself at a shack
down by the tributary

30:57.024 --> 30:59.151
owned by a trucker named Devlin.

31:00.402 --> 31:05.449
There we are at the shack, and I burst in.
Devlin's away on a trucking run.

31:06.992 --> 31:09.620
But there she is, little Gracie…

31:12.748 --> 31:16.877
tied to a La-Z-Boy,
eating some animal crackers for dinner,

31:18.086 --> 31:21.423
coloring in some TV Guide or some shit.

31:22.299 --> 31:25.677
But she's untouched. Unharmed.

31:28.805 --> 31:30.390
Why ain't I never heard this story?

31:31.391 --> 31:32.809
Two days later,

31:32.893 --> 31:36.355
there was a parade planned for her
and everything, down Main Street.

31:36.855 --> 31:40.943
Governor was gonna come.
Pin me on a badge like my daddy.

31:43.445 --> 31:44.947
The morning before the parade,

31:46.156 --> 31:50.285
Gracie's daddy takes her to the store,
buy her an ice cream,

31:50.369 --> 31:52.538
special treat after
what she's been through.

31:54.039 --> 31:55.749
And on the way back to the parade

31:56.583 --> 31:59.211
an 18-wheeler loses control,

31:59.294 --> 32:01.547
smashes into Gracie's daddy's truck,

32:01.630 --> 32:04.007
and the girl goes flying
through the windshield.

32:05.300 --> 32:07.261
Dead on impact. Just like that.

32:09.263 --> 32:10.389
Ain't no parade.

32:12.182 --> 32:13.392
Ain't no medal. [chuckles]

32:14.351 --> 32:15.477
Ain't no girl.

32:16.728 --> 32:17.980
Ain't no story.

32:23.193 --> 32:27.823
Well, you keep people safe, Sheriff.
Always have.

32:30.492 --> 32:35.581
I thought at the end
I would finally have my stand.

32:40.085 --> 32:44.339
But here I am at the end, darling,
and there is nothing.

32:46.175 --> 32:47.176
Nothing.

32:51.680 --> 32:53.015
Until today.

32:57.394 --> 32:59.980
Until today. And now I'm thinking…

33:01.440 --> 33:02.900
all these signs,

33:03.609 --> 33:07.154
that maybe God is--
is giving me something.

33:07.779 --> 33:09.281
Something bigger.

33:10.199 --> 33:12.117
He waited till the last minute. And--

33:12.910 --> 33:16.747
And maybe this is the point
to all of this. To me.

33:18.040 --> 33:19.082
It's gotta be.

33:21.084 --> 33:22.085
Right?

34:20.060 --> 34:22.020
[dog barking in distance]

34:22.103 --> 34:23.605
[breathing shakily]

34:39.621 --> 34:42.666

36:19.471 --> 36:20.722
[Luke] Mom, are you okay?

36:21.890 --> 36:22.975
[Sarah] Where are we?

36:23.809 --> 36:25.811
[pants]

36:25.894 --> 36:27.563
[car engine starts]

36:27.646 --> 36:31.358
Just had to do an errand, sweetie.

36:39.241 --> 36:41.201
I wanna watch Moana.

36:43.537 --> 36:44.913
[mother] Do whatever you want.

36:47.916 --> 36:50.544
I want Devil Dogs. [chuckles]

36:51.962 --> 36:53.130
I want Gushers.

36:53.839 --> 36:55.340

41:29.740 --> 41:31.658
[chuckles] God, baby.

41:32.326 --> 41:33.327
You scared me.

41:33.410 --> 41:34.494
How was the dinner?

41:34.995 --> 41:37.414
It was good. It was good.

41:38.916 --> 41:42.377
Those guys drink way too much,
but it was fine.

41:43.670 --> 41:44.671
That's great.

41:45.881 --> 41:48.967
I knew you'd be hungry,
so I put a little dinner together for you.

41:49.051 --> 41:50.219
Oh, I already ate.

41:51.637 --> 41:53.305
You always like a midnight snack.

41:53.388 --> 41:55.766
Well, I'll eat in the morning.

41:56.850 --> 41:59.811
I made it special, and I kept it warm.
Come on, hon.

42:03.982 --> 42:04.983
[Manny sighs]

42:12.449 --> 42:13.450
Looks good.

42:14.368 --> 42:15.494
-Doesn't it?
-Mm-hmm.

42:17.079 --> 42:18.080
You join me?

42:27.089 --> 42:28.465
We locked in a new account.

42:32.094 --> 42:33.554
You should have seen Jim and me.

42:34.680 --> 42:36.139
They had the whole board there.

42:36.640 --> 42:40.310
And I'm telling you,
I had them in the palm of my hand.

42:40.394 --> 42:41.395
Uh-huh.

42:46.733 --> 42:47.734
What is this, hon?

42:49.611 --> 42:50.821
It's good, isn't it?

42:53.949 --> 42:55.742
Better than the stuff you usually make.

42:57.327 --> 42:58.328
More, um…

43:00.664 --> 43:01.665
flavor.

43:02.291 --> 43:03.458
Mmm.

43:07.838 --> 43:08.839
It's, um--

43:12.176 --> 43:15.429
It's this new recipe I found. [chuckles]

43:15.512 --> 43:17.097
Online, of all places.

43:18.182 --> 43:20.225
I think this one's called…

43:22.060 --> 43:25.898
"Mandy's Organic Flank Steak,"
or something.

43:28.275 --> 43:30.235
This woman in Great Neck, she--

43:30.903 --> 43:34.573
she posts all these delicious recipes.
[chuckles]

43:35.282 --> 43:36.700
She's a great cook.

43:38.619 --> 43:39.995
Oh, shoot, I--

43:40.662 --> 43:43.081
I, uh-- I forgot the best part.

43:43.165 --> 43:44.750
-That's okay.
-[fridge door opens]

43:45.876 --> 43:48.337

-No, no. We need it.

[lid pops open]

43:50.214 --> 43:51.715
[breathes shakily]

43:55.260 --> 43:57.471
Go on, have some more.

43:57.554 --> 43:58.555
I'm full.

43:58.639 --> 43:59.765
Eat it, hon.

44:02.226 --> 44:03.477
Eat it.

44:07.481 --> 44:08.690
Is this what you like?

44:12.027 --> 44:13.028
Why?

44:15.531 --> 44:17.324
Come on, why?

44:19.826 --> 44:20.953
'Cause she's blonde?

44:25.707 --> 44:26.834
'Cause she's fit?

44:29.878 --> 44:32.172
'Cause she has perfect tits?

44:35.259 --> 44:36.510
'Cause she's white?

44:39.179 --> 44:40.180
Why?

44:41.431 --> 44:42.891
I did everything.

44:45.185 --> 44:46.395
I gave everything.

44:48.605 --> 44:50.065
I gave you everything.

44:51.400 --> 44:52.943
I gave up everything.

44:55.362 --> 44:56.655
Why?

45:01.785 --> 45:02.870
'Cause she's not you.

45:10.627 --> 45:12.337
[scoffs] And…

45:13.714 --> 45:15.465
who am I?

45:43.827 --> 45:45.370
[mother] Sarah?

45:47.122 --> 45:48.916
-What's happening?
-I don't know.

45:48.999 --> 45:50.167
I don't know. Are you okay?

45:50.751 --> 45:53.295
[breathing shakily]
It's all right. It's all right.

46:02.638 --> 46:06.517
[Manny] Okay, you're fine.
You're fine. Okay.

46:07.100 --> 46:08.393
Sarah?

46:08.477 --> 46:10.812
[alarms blaring]

46:16.777 --> 46:18.862
[glass shattering outside]

47:11.957 --> 47:13.333
[in Japanese] Do you see that?

47:17.462 --> 47:19.298
What is that?

47:20.174 --> 47:21.175
[bangs]

47:22.759 --> 47:24.136
There's nothing there.

47:35.856 --> 47:39.318

47:46.533 --> 47:48.285
[in English]
If y'all could just quiet down.

47:48.368 --> 47:50.162
-[chattering continues]
-Quiet, please.

47:50.245 --> 47:52.331
-[chattering fades]
-Thank you.

47:55.250 --> 47:58.170
Well, good Lord, Sheriff Tyson.

47:59.296 --> 48:00.714
Jim Bell, would you please?

48:00.797 --> 48:02.633
[cheering, whistling]

48:16.522 --> 48:18.982
The reason we are all standing here today

48:19.691 --> 48:23.445
is to honor your 45 years of service
to this great town.

48:24.821 --> 48:27.074
So we would like to give you
this key to the city

48:28.492 --> 48:32.955
and this certificate
of Town Proclamation 851-B.

48:33.830 --> 48:35.040
[cheering]

48:42.965 --> 48:45.384
Sheriff, why don't you go ahead
and read what it says?

48:50.430 --> 48:52.683
Well, first, uh-- Let--

48:52.766 --> 48:55.769
Let me thank y'all for coming out,
and, uh,

48:55.853 --> 48:59.356
thank you, Mayor Heller,
for setting all this up, and, um…

[breathes shakily]

49:03.193 --> 49:04.945
This is-- [sighs]

49:05.028 --> 49:07.573
This is a hard day. But it's a good one.

49:08.615 --> 49:10.409
My Mary-Star likes to say,

49:11.201 --> 49:14.705
"This ain't the end.
It's just the end of the beginning."

49:14.788 --> 49:17.040
[audience chuckles] Aw!

49:17.124 --> 49:21.211
Believe you me, being retired with her
is gonna feel like a lifetime.

49:21.295 --> 49:23.213
[audience laughing]

49:24.256 --> 49:25.424
[quietly] No. It's not.

49:26.925 --> 49:28.260
Anyways, um-- [clears throat]

49:28.844 --> 49:30.596
Let's see if I can still read good.

hereby declares today

a life well lived with duty and purpose…

50:05.088 --> 50:09.551
a life and a career of meaning."

50:28.111 --> 50:29.279
[man] You okay?

50:41.250 --> 50:43.669
[crickets chirping]

51:24.168 --> 51:26.295
[panting]

51:39.016 --> 51:44.396
Come on, now, you sumbitch.
Show me. Come on, now!
