WEBVTT

00:01.002 --> 00:02.754
<i>Previously on</i> Homeland...

00:02.837 --> 00:04.339
Come on, Saul.
I-I appreciate the visit,

00:04.422 --> 00:06.299
but why are you really here?

00:06.383 --> 00:08.093
Yevgeny slipped the net.

00:08.176 --> 00:10.345
<i>Best guess is
he made it back to Russia.</i>

00:10.428 --> 00:11.805
<i>- Fuck.
- Yeah.</i>

00:11.888 --> 00:14.391
- So what do you need?
- Next best thing to you, Carrie?

00:14.474 --> 00:17.811
- I need your team.
- To do what? Repatriate him?

00:17.894 --> 00:19.729
Him or Simone Martin.

00:19.813 --> 00:21.773
Turns out she might
be alive after all.

00:21.856 --> 00:24.025
Unless the White House
has concocted

00:24.109 --> 00:26.111
a truly epic web of lies,

00:26.194 --> 00:28.738
I am the tip of the spear

00:28.822 --> 00:31.950
of one of the most insidious
attacks ever perpetrated

00:32.033 --> 00:34.828
on the institution
of American democracy.

00:34.911 --> 00:37.163
You're firing your cabinet.

00:37.247 --> 00:38.832
Only those who caved.

00:38.915 --> 00:40.792
You have no idea who that is.

00:40.875 --> 00:43.294
Well, I can
damn well guess.

00:43.378 --> 00:46.673
The president is covering up
one crime with another.

00:46.756 --> 00:49.551
A majority
of the cabinet concurs.

00:49.634 --> 00:53.221
Eight secretaries are ready
to sign a document if you are.

00:53.304 --> 00:55.932
The vice president is here.

00:56.015 --> 01:00.520
You signed no document
invoking the 25th Amendment?

01:00.603 --> 01:03.148
I have not,
on the one condition

01:03.231 --> 01:05.775
that you immediately
walk back the firing

01:05.859 --> 01:07.986
of Secretary Mullen
and the others.

01:08.069 --> 01:09.946
The answer is no.

01:10.029 --> 01:11.990
Then you leave me no choice

01:12.073 --> 01:15.869
but to deliver a document
declaring you unfit

01:15.952 --> 01:18.246
for the office
of the presidency.

01:18.329 --> 01:19.706
So what's your plan?

01:19.789 --> 01:22.417
At my request,
president's demanded

01:22.500 --> 01:25.003
immediate and high-level talks
with my counterparts.

01:25.086 --> 01:27.964
As the pretext for
an operation to grab Simone?

01:28.047 --> 01:29.632
Delegation leaves tonight.

01:29.716 --> 01:33.303
Is it too late for me to join?
I think I could be useful.

01:36.014 --> 01:38.391
- Ready?
- Yeah.

01:49.486 --> 01:51.738
<i>He saved our lives.</i>

01:51.821 --> 01:53.323
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:53.406 --> 01:57.702
<i>What was his name?</i>

01:57.786 --> 02:01.331
<i>Carrie, you're not yourself.</i>

02:01.414 --> 02:03.917
<i>But you don't have my condition.</i>

02:04.000 --> 02:06.461
<i>I'm dealing with it.
I-I've been dealing with it</i>

02:06.544 --> 02:08.129
<i>since I was 22.</i>

02:09.798 --> 02:13.218
<i>She said no one at work could know. She's bipolar.</i>

02:13.301 --> 02:17.013
<i>The mood of the country, it's not great.</i>

02:17.096 --> 02:19.808
<i>Civil... war!</i>

02:19.891 --> 02:22.018
<i>Madam President, please!</i>

02:22.101 --> 02:24.938
<i>You have to put a stop to this!</i>

02:25.021 --> 02:27.190
<i>It's only getting worse.</i>

02:27.273 --> 02:29.192
<i>Is there no fucking line?</i>

02:29.275 --> 02:33.613
<i>Ridiculous lies and accusations.</i>

02:36.449 --> 02:39.828
<i>The White House is in crisis mode.</i>

02:39.911 --> 02:43.581
<i>I'm talking about information warfare.</i>

02:43.665 --> 02:46.626
<i>Our country is under attack.</i>

02:48.086 --> 02:51.506
<i>The time to rise up is now!</i>

02:53.091 --> 02:56.386
<i>I swore an oath to protect it.</i>

02:58.680 --> 03:01.599
<i>Just think of meas a light on the heavens,</i>

03:01.683 --> 03:06.437
<i>a beacon, steering you clear
of the wrongs.</i>

03:43.266 --> 03:45.435
Department of Justice.

03:45.518 --> 03:47.812
Lawyers.

04:54.963 --> 04:58.216
They tell me you don't
get a lot of visitors.

04:58.299 --> 05:01.219
I can see why.

05:03.012 --> 05:06.849
I take it you're aware
of the mess in Washington.

05:06.933 --> 05:08.476
Yeah, the mess you made.

05:08.559 --> 05:12.021
I'd say President Keane
gets most of the credit.

05:12.105 --> 05:13.648
We're invoking
the 25th Amendment

05:13.731 --> 05:16.985
to remove her.
It's at the Supreme Court now.

05:17.068 --> 05:18.903
She thinks she's got
the winning argument,

05:18.987 --> 05:22.115
but from what I'm hearing,
she'll be gone very soon.

05:22.198 --> 05:24.701
- So what do you want from me?
- Advice.

05:24.784 --> 05:26.703
Because just when there's light
at the end of the tunnel,

05:26.786 --> 05:31.165
I get some disturbing news
about your pal Saul Berenson,

05:31.249 --> 05:33.084
who, with everything
happening in Washington,

05:33.167 --> 05:35.920
suddenly flies off to Moscow
in the middle of the night

05:36.004 --> 05:39.090
on an unscheduled
"diplomatic mission."

05:39.173 --> 05:40.717
Who told you that?

05:40.800 --> 05:43.094
A reliable source,

05:43.177 --> 05:46.723
who also provided
a passenger manifest.

05:49.475 --> 05:50.768
What do you want me to do?

05:50.852 --> 05:53.521
Tell me what
he's up to over there.

05:53.604 --> 05:55.064
Why would I?

05:55.148 --> 05:57.817
Because there's a new
administration coming,

05:57.900 --> 06:00.111
and I'm thinking,
with everyone else in town

06:00.194 --> 06:02.530
free as a bird,
why not you?

06:11.706 --> 06:12.999
Carrie Mathison...

06:13.082 --> 06:15.460
and her team from Kabul.

06:15.543 --> 06:17.378
Saul.

06:17.462 --> 06:20.048
And two lawyers from DOJ

06:20.131 --> 06:23.634
who probably have no idea
what's really going on.

06:23.718 --> 06:25.845
What <i>is</i> going on?

06:25.928 --> 06:28.473
Carrie and three of her buddies
from the Middle East?

06:28.556 --> 06:32.518
It's not a diplomatic mission.
It's a covert operation.

06:32.602 --> 06:33.853
To do what?

06:33.936 --> 06:36.064
How am I supposed to know?

06:36.147 --> 06:39.484
I've been here, walking around
in circles for six months.

06:39.567 --> 06:40.985
Well, who <i>would</i> know?

06:41.069 --> 06:43.279
Whoever's running it
stateside.

06:43.362 --> 06:45.656
The Agency.

06:45.740 --> 06:46.866
That place is a sieve.

06:46.949 --> 06:49.660
Saul would have
his own small group,

06:49.744 --> 06:51.996
off-campus, handpicked.

06:52.080 --> 06:53.998
Who?

06:54.082 --> 06:55.249
People he trusts.

06:55.333 --> 06:57.543
Seconded from other agencies

06:57.627 --> 07:00.838
or recent retirees brought back
for a last fling.

07:00.922 --> 07:04.300
Doesn't exactly
narrow it down.

07:04.383 --> 07:06.844
He went to Russia.

07:06.928 --> 07:09.222
Look for Russian experts.

07:11.933 --> 07:15.228
You'll find
there aren't that many.

07:33.746 --> 07:37.708
- Welcome to Moscow.
- Jim.

07:46.717 --> 07:48.219
This is your clean suite.

07:48.302 --> 07:50.680
We can't vouch for
any other place in the hotel.

07:50.763 --> 07:52.974
You need to talk,
do it here.

07:54.308 --> 07:56.310
These guys are
all over everything.

07:56.394 --> 07:58.062
Assume you're being watched.

08:20.710 --> 08:23.421
Now for some
encouraging news.

08:27.925 --> 08:29.510
Yevgeny's dacha.

08:29.594 --> 08:31.345
And there they are.

08:31.429 --> 08:33.556
Pretty much around the clock.

08:33.639 --> 08:36.726
- What are they up to?
- In Russian? <i>Chertov.</i>

08:36.809 --> 08:40.396
With occasional walks
to the village for food.

08:40.479 --> 08:42.190
Think that presents
an opportunity?

08:42.273 --> 08:43.900
I think we should
stick with the original plan.

08:43.983 --> 08:46.694
Security remains light
at the dacha, at least so far.

08:46.777 --> 08:50.031
Two guards are camped out
at the end of the driveway,

08:50.114 --> 08:52.116
plus a third
who wanders the grounds

08:52.200 --> 08:54.619
according to a schedule
we have yet to divine.

08:54.702 --> 08:55.870
Almost lackadaisical.

08:55.953 --> 08:57.663
What's the old
Soviet saying?

08:57.747 --> 08:59.790
"We pretend to work,
you pretend to pay us"?

09:01.375 --> 09:04.295
Who's going in?

09:05.504 --> 09:06.672
And you're on comms?

09:06.756 --> 09:08.090
- That's right.
- What about the locals?

09:08.174 --> 09:10.009
Two, just like you asked.
Totally reliable.

09:10.092 --> 09:13.095
We've used them before. They'll
meet up with you at the site.

09:13.179 --> 09:16.641
- Questions?
- Well, I have a few.

09:16.724 --> 09:18.351
Yevgeny sticks to Simone
like glue.

09:18.434 --> 09:20.269
How do you intend
on breaking him off?

09:20.353 --> 09:21.604
We have a plan for that.

09:21.687 --> 09:23.481
And what about
her exfiltration after?

09:25.316 --> 09:26.984
We have a plan for that, too.

09:27.068 --> 09:30.780
Fine. One last thing.
From what I'm hearing,

09:30.863 --> 09:33.532
the president is hanging on
by a thread in Washington.

09:33.616 --> 09:36.869
She authorized this operation.
What happens if she falls?

09:36.953 --> 09:40.039
Anyone have a plan for that?

09:48.422 --> 09:49.966
Can I help you?

09:50.049 --> 09:53.135
I hope so. Is Clint here?

09:53.219 --> 09:54.762
Clint?

09:56.347 --> 09:58.224
Come on. He's in back.

10:00.643 --> 10:02.311
Clint, you have a visitor.

10:07.817 --> 10:09.026
Hello.

10:09.110 --> 10:12.029
Well, I'll just...

10:15.783 --> 10:17.868
Who are you?

10:17.952 --> 10:20.037
Janet. Bayne.

10:20.121 --> 10:22.373
Senator Paley's assistant.

10:23.791 --> 10:27.128
Chief of staff,
but, yeah, I am.

10:27.211 --> 10:30.673
In fact, a question
the senator posed to me,

10:30.756 --> 10:33.009
a personnel question,
is what led me here to you,

10:33.092 --> 10:36.512
and, uh, I'll just say it.

10:36.595 --> 10:39.807
I know you're working
with Saul Berenson.

10:41.058 --> 10:43.185
I also know he just took
a group to Moscow--

10:43.269 --> 10:45.187
Carrie Mathison,
among others--

10:45.271 --> 10:47.315
supposedly to object
to operations

10:47.398 --> 10:49.525
the Russians are running
here in the U.S.,

10:49.608 --> 10:53.904
but, really,
they're over there to...

10:53.988 --> 10:56.532
That's the part
I need you to fill in.

10:58.284 --> 11:00.244
Wait. They <i>are</i> there

11:00.328 --> 11:03.748
to talk about Russian
operations in the U.S.

11:03.831 --> 11:06.292
- Really?
- Really.

11:06.375 --> 11:09.253
I mean, if it's
something else...

11:09.337 --> 11:10.504
I don't know.

11:10.588 --> 11:12.298
Well, I'm sorry
to hear that,

11:12.381 --> 11:15.718
because this little spy
fraternity you're involved in,

11:15.801 --> 11:17.303
it's completely illegal,

11:17.386 --> 11:20.389
especially if you're supporting
off-book operations in Moscow.

11:20.473 --> 11:23.184
Clint?
Can I bring you guys something?

11:23.267 --> 11:27.730
- Yeah, just a second, Mom!
- So, why are they there?

11:31.650 --> 11:34.320
I will call the attorney general
right now.

11:34.403 --> 11:35.946
I really will.

11:36.030 --> 11:39.867
I will call the attorney general
and blow the whole thing up.

11:43.871 --> 11:45.456
Fuck.

11:51.545 --> 11:54.590
They're there, um...

11:54.673 --> 11:58.552
They're there...

11:58.636 --> 12:01.180
to retrieve Simone Martin.

12:07.978 --> 12:09.271
She's alive?

12:45.558 --> 12:47.810
Before we begin...

13:16.172 --> 13:18.215
Where's Yevgeny Gromov?

13:21.427 --> 13:23.596
You promised to gather
the relevant parties.

13:27.391 --> 13:30.352
<i>- And we have.</i>
- Then where is Yevgeny Gromov?

13:30.436 --> 13:32.980
Yevgeny?

13:33.063 --> 13:37.693
Gromov. You must know him.

13:37.776 --> 13:39.904
He has unique knowledge
of the issues

13:39.987 --> 13:41.322
we're here to discuss.

13:48.412 --> 13:51.582
- He's nobody.
- I disagree.

13:51.665 --> 13:55.127
In fact, the opposite.

13:55.211 --> 13:57.838
We feel there's no point
in proceeding without him.

14:07.556 --> 14:09.517
<i>Karasho</i>.

14:09.600 --> 14:12.728
<i>Fine. I will try to find him.</i>

14:24.698 --> 14:27.243
<i>- Da?
- Yevgeny.</i>

15:38.731 --> 15:42.359
The director suggests we
adjourn until Yevgeny arrives.

15:42.443 --> 15:44.945
Yep.

15:53.746 --> 15:56.790
You're on.

16:27.780 --> 16:30.741
- Well?
- "Well" what?

16:30.824 --> 16:32.993
What I told you.

16:33.077 --> 16:35.537
Simone, alive and well
in Russia...

16:35.621 --> 16:37.456
I said I need time
to think about it.

16:37.539 --> 16:39.375
We don't have time.

16:41.168 --> 16:44.588
Fucking Keane
and her fucking Russians.

16:44.672 --> 16:47.341
- I know.
- Worst part is, she told me.

16:47.424 --> 16:49.760
She told me not only
that it was Russians

16:49.843 --> 16:53.972
but that they were using me
to get to her.

16:54.056 --> 16:56.892
Imagine Simone Martin back here,
saying that publicly,

16:56.975 --> 16:59.186
that everything we've been
blaming on Keane

16:59.269 --> 17:01.689
is actually Russians.

17:01.772 --> 17:04.400
It's not inevitable
that Simone Martin

17:04.483 --> 17:05.818
makes it back
to the United States.

17:05.901 --> 17:07.444
It is very much up to you.

17:07.528 --> 17:09.238
What do you mean
it's up to me?

17:09.321 --> 17:14.118
A few words to
the Russian ambassador...

17:14.201 --> 17:16.662
A few words,
and Saul's mission fails.

17:18.455 --> 17:19.915
You want me to rat out
our own guys?

17:19.998 --> 17:22.292
No, I want you to finish
what we started

17:22.376 --> 17:24.420
and remove a president
so despised

17:24.503 --> 17:26.630
her own cabinet lined up
to get rid of her.

17:26.714 --> 17:28.799
Were we wrong about
some facts? Apparently.

17:28.882 --> 17:31.093
But we were not wrong
about her.

17:39.143 --> 17:41.979
I took the liberty of telling
the ambassador's office...

17:42.062 --> 17:45.399
- Jesus.
- ...you might want
a few words with him.

17:45.482 --> 17:48.444
You know the country
will be better off.

17:48.527 --> 17:50.612
The country?

17:50.696 --> 17:55.075
Okay. You and me, too.
What's wrong with that?

18:08.630 --> 18:11.133
He's waiting, Senator.

18:11.216 --> 18:13.719
Senator?

18:13.802 --> 18:16.388
Fuck it.

18:38.202 --> 18:39.745
Stand by.

18:42.414 --> 18:43.957
Ready.

18:45.375 --> 18:47.044
Thank you for coming.

18:47.127 --> 18:49.713
I know it was
an inconvenience.

18:49.797 --> 18:53.467
But believe me, we've come
much, much further to be here.

18:55.219 --> 18:58.013
We made the journey to ask you
about your involvement

18:58.096 --> 18:59.515
in several recent events.

18:59.598 --> 19:02.309
One, the death
of General McClendon

19:02.392 --> 19:04.561
at Hazelton Penitentiary.

19:04.645 --> 19:06.939
Two, a false news report
propagated during

19:07.022 --> 19:09.191
an armed standoff
at Lucasville, Virginia,

19:09.274 --> 19:13.529
that resulted in the death of
dozens of American civilians.

19:13.612 --> 19:16.907
Three, the death
of FBI Agent Dante Allen

19:16.990 --> 19:21.495
in an emergency room at
a hospital near Washington, D.C.

19:32.506 --> 19:34.925
We respectfully disagree.

19:37.010 --> 19:38.512
Hmm.

19:40.430 --> 19:44.017
No. They're quite real.

20:55.088 --> 20:58.216
We're not here to talk about
the last 30 years.

21:01.553 --> 21:04.431
Well, <i>we're</i> here
to talk about this.

21:04.514 --> 21:06.725
You...

21:06.808 --> 21:08.060
in Lucasville.

21:08.143 --> 21:10.437
You... in an emergency room

21:10.520 --> 21:12.314
outside of Washington, D.C.

21:12.397 --> 21:17.027
You... using me to inflict
damage on my own country.

21:33.585 --> 21:35.712
Uh, maybe we should all
have a break.

22:05.075 --> 22:07.119
- Is everything okay?
- So far. Why?

22:07.202 --> 22:08.537
Something just happened
downstairs.

22:08.620 --> 22:10.330
A message came in to Mirov.

22:10.414 --> 22:14.126
Maybe it was nothing, but you
should give 'em a heads-up.

22:14.209 --> 22:15.460
Alpha One, this is Main.

22:15.544 --> 22:17.921
<i>What's your status?</i>

22:18.005 --> 22:19.840
All good. They're fine.

23:25.363 --> 23:26.990
- Shit.
- Alpha One?

23:30.410 --> 23:32.996
- It's a fucking ambush.
- Alpha Two?

23:46.176 --> 23:49.137
Move! Go! Let's go!

23:57.813 --> 23:59.356
<i>Go!</i>

24:16.832 --> 24:19.000
<i>Main, this is Alpha Two, inbound.</i>

24:19.084 --> 24:20.418
<i>We're down a man. Over.</i>

24:20.502 --> 24:22.546
Copy that, Alpha Two.

24:54.327 --> 24:56.872
Five to four.

24:56.955 --> 24:58.290
Against.

24:58.373 --> 25:01.459
The Supreme Court
just announced it.

25:03.837 --> 25:06.715
How is that possible?

25:06.798 --> 25:09.301
The solicitor general sat
right there two days ago

25:09.384 --> 25:11.761
and assured me that
the cabinet serves

25:11.845 --> 25:13.096
at my discretion.

25:13.180 --> 25:15.182
I can fire them
as I wish.

25:15.265 --> 25:19.269
Apparently, the court
had issues with the... delivery.

25:19.352 --> 25:23.440
- What delivery?
- Of the notice of termination
to the cabinet members.

25:27.569 --> 25:29.779
They're not gonna stop, these
people lined up against me.

25:29.863 --> 25:32.240
I think we should focus
on more hopeful terrain.

25:32.324 --> 25:34.451
- Like what?
- The vote in Congress, for one.

25:34.534 --> 25:36.995
Two-thirds is
a very high bar.

25:37.078 --> 25:39.664
And Saul in Moscow.

25:39.748 --> 25:41.208
They'll probably get
to him, too.

25:44.377 --> 25:46.963
- Madam President.
- What is it?

25:48.590 --> 25:50.842
It's okay, Ashley.
Thank you.

25:51.801 --> 25:53.178
Not wasting any time.

25:53.261 --> 25:55.931
So you heard
the court's decision.

25:56.014 --> 25:59.100
Yeah. Delivery issues
with the pink slips.

25:59.184 --> 26:01.728
Not enough stamps, I guess.

26:01.811 --> 26:04.773
This is a moment that was
never meant to happen.

26:04.856 --> 26:05.941
You know that, right?

26:06.024 --> 26:08.109
A moment utterly
not contemplated

26:08.193 --> 26:11.571
in the Constitution.
Everyone keeps waving around

26:11.655 --> 26:13.698
like they actually care
what it says.

26:13.782 --> 26:15.700
I do care what
the Constitution says.

26:15.784 --> 26:20.163
Good. Then explain to me
how you used the 25th Amendment

26:20.247 --> 26:22.707
to oust a president
who is not in a coma,

26:22.791 --> 26:24.876
not in any way disabled,

26:24.960 --> 26:27.504
clearly in possession
of her faculties,

26:27.587 --> 26:31.091
clearly able to discharge
the duties of her office.

26:31.174 --> 26:33.885
- How is that done?
- Madam President, I am here

26:33.969 --> 26:37.138
to relieve you
of your command.

27:24.311 --> 27:27.397
We were fine,
and then we weren't.

27:27.480 --> 27:29.357
- They knew we were coming.
- Gotta figure out how.

27:29.441 --> 27:31.026
No, we don't. You don't know
they were tipped off.

27:31.109 --> 27:33.611
It's not true. We saw Mirov
get some kind of message.

27:33.695 --> 27:35.405
- He left the room.
- That could've been anything.

27:35.488 --> 27:37.574
It was always a Hail Mary,
this operation.

27:37.657 --> 27:38.992
It failed, for whatever reason.

27:39.075 --> 27:41.328
Only thing we had going
for us was surprise,

27:41.411 --> 27:42.704
which is gone,
as is Simone,

27:42.787 --> 27:44.914
who could be anywhere
on the planet by now.

27:47.417 --> 27:49.085
So what we're gonna do
is get out

27:49.169 --> 27:51.463
before we're called to account
for those bodies at the dacha.

27:51.546 --> 27:53.923
We're leaving?
You can't be serious.

27:54.007 --> 27:56.551
I am, 'cause while this
was going south,

27:56.634 --> 27:58.887
something else happened
back in Washington.

27:58.970 --> 28:01.139
Elizabeth Keane is
no longer president.

28:02.724 --> 28:06.561
Whatever authorization
we had has vanished.

28:09.314 --> 28:11.191
We leave in the morning.

28:11.274 --> 28:13.777
We use the situation in D.C.
to explain our departure.

28:13.860 --> 28:16.112
Saul, we're not finished.
We can't be.

28:16.196 --> 28:18.239
There is
something to be done here.

28:18.323 --> 28:20.575
So tell me,
what's the plan?

28:22.911 --> 28:25.622
- We can't just leave.
- We can.

28:25.705 --> 28:27.916
First thing in the morning.

28:39.719 --> 28:41.805
We're here.

28:41.888 --> 28:43.932
How are things
in Washington?

28:44.015 --> 28:47.602
- Couldn't be more fucked up.
<i>- Except here.</i>

28:47.685 --> 28:49.729
Carrie?
We got your message,

28:49.813 --> 28:51.689
<i>but we don't quite understand
what you have in mind.</i>

28:51.773 --> 28:55.026
- Simone has vanished.
- Yeah. That we understood.

28:55.110 --> 28:57.487
We don't have the time or
resources to locate her again.

28:57.570 --> 28:59.030
And even if we did,
she'll be under guard now

28:59.114 --> 29:00.281
in a way she wasn't before.

29:00.365 --> 29:02.242
<i>We need someone
to take us to her.</i>

29:02.325 --> 29:04.202
- So what's the plan?
<i>- I don't know.</i>

29:04.285 --> 29:06.955
<i>I don't know.
That's what Saul asked.</i>

29:07.038 --> 29:08.415
There are all kinds
of animosities

29:08.498 --> 29:09.791
on their side of the table.

29:09.874 --> 29:11.501
I spent the whole day
staring at them.

29:11.584 --> 29:15.839
<i>General Yakushin from SVR
and Mirov from the G.R.U.,</i>

29:15.922 --> 29:18.341
<i>they can't stand each other,
and Yakushin's</i>

29:18.425 --> 29:21.177
<i>really had it up to here with
Yevgeny's condescending crap.</i>

29:21.261 --> 29:23.888
There are fissures there
we can pry open,

29:23.972 --> 29:27.142
turn them against each other
in a way they do us.

29:27.225 --> 29:29.185
<i>Yevgeny's the only one who
actually cares about Simone.</i>

29:29.269 --> 29:32.147
There-there must be
something we can exploit.

29:32.230 --> 29:33.857
Okay, that's...

29:33.940 --> 29:35.442
A wish, not a plan. I know.

29:35.525 --> 29:37.735
I was gonna say
it's a good idea.

29:37.819 --> 29:42.365
This SVR guy, Yakushin.

29:42.449 --> 29:44.826
He's the one you can get to.
He's old-school.

29:44.909 --> 29:46.369
<i>He wants America
to be stable.</i>

29:46.453 --> 29:48.872
<i>It's where he hides
all the money he steals.</i>

29:48.955 --> 29:50.206
<i>Drives him crazy,</i>

29:50.290 --> 29:53.543
Yevgeny going around
stirring up trouble.

29:53.626 --> 29:55.920
So you think we play on
his resentment?

29:56.004 --> 29:57.172
<i>God, no.</i>

29:57.255 --> 29:58.840
Carrie, I'm sending you
something.

29:58.923 --> 30:01.301
<i>You wanna get to him?</i>

30:01.384 --> 30:03.052
<i>Forget resentment.</i>

30:03.136 --> 30:05.180
<i>Go for his money.</i>

30:05.263 --> 30:07.140
How?

30:08.683 --> 30:12.353
We make it disappear.

30:37.670 --> 30:39.672
Sorry if I woke you.

30:39.756 --> 30:42.008
You really think
I've been sleeping?

30:42.091 --> 30:45.386
- So?
- You said you wanted a plan.

30:45.470 --> 30:47.555
What I said was
we're going home.

30:47.639 --> 30:49.432
Well, I've got one.

30:49.516 --> 30:51.768
Wanna hear it?

30:52.977 --> 30:55.063
You were in that room,
just like I was.

30:55.146 --> 30:59.234
There are divisions on their
side we can use against them.

30:59.317 --> 31:00.610
That's it?

31:00.693 --> 31:04.781
No.
Yevgeny's like this with Simone,

31:04.864 --> 31:06.699
he'll be even
more protective of her

31:06.783 --> 31:08.159
after what happened today.

31:08.243 --> 31:11.037
His boss, Mirov-- he doesn't
care about her personally,

31:11.120 --> 31:12.914
but he needs to
protect her, too.

31:12.997 --> 31:14.624
The last thing he wants
is her back in the U.S.,

31:14.707 --> 31:17.335
blabbing about how they all
brought down a president.

31:17.418 --> 31:19.837
Yakushin, though,
has resentments

31:19.921 --> 31:22.006
the size of fucking Siberia
about what those two

31:22.090 --> 31:23.258
have been doing over
at the G.R.U.

31:23.341 --> 31:24.592
That doesn't mean
he'll help us.

31:24.676 --> 31:26.928
No, but it means
he won't mind helping us,

31:27.011 --> 31:29.597
- given the proper incentive.
- Which is what?

31:29.681 --> 31:32.016
Yakushin's got nearly
$300 million in U.S. banks,

31:32.100 --> 31:34.269
funneled through corporations
he controls.

31:34.352 --> 31:37.063
We drain those accounts.
He asks what he has to do

31:37.146 --> 31:40.191
to get his money back.
We tell him, "Get us Simone."

31:40.275 --> 31:42.902
- You think he'll deliver Simone?
- I don't need him to.

31:42.986 --> 31:44.988
All he has to do is find her.
I'll do the rest.

31:45.071 --> 31:47.490
- You will.
- With Anson and Bennet.

31:47.574 --> 31:49.993
Okay, suppose you're right
and Yakushin finds her.

31:50.076 --> 31:52.745
Suppose, by some miracle,
you manage to get to her,

31:52.829 --> 31:54.163
wherever she may be.

31:54.247 --> 31:56.666
What then?
What's the exfil plan?

31:56.749 --> 31:57.875
It's the same as before.

31:57.959 --> 32:00.169
No, it's not the same.
It can't be.

32:00.253 --> 32:04.882
Exfil plan was built on a narrow
window of surprise that's gone.

32:04.966 --> 32:07.176
So tell me,
with everyone watching,

32:07.260 --> 32:10.972
how do we get Simone and you
back to the U.S.?

32:11.055 --> 32:13.099
That's not the mission.

32:13.182 --> 32:15.727
The mission is
to retrieve Simone.

32:15.810 --> 32:17.395
- Carrie.
- Which, I swear to God,

32:17.478 --> 32:19.814
is still possible,
and I've not come all this way

32:19.897 --> 32:21.733
in that fucking plane
and in my life

32:21.816 --> 32:25.695
to fail in that mission
when I know I can succeed.

32:28.448 --> 32:30.742
You've given me a hard time
the past few years.

32:30.825 --> 32:32.785
I'm in, I'm out,
I'm all over the place.

32:32.869 --> 32:34.912
I am not
all over the place now.

32:34.996 --> 32:37.040
I'm here and I'm all in,

32:37.123 --> 32:40.793
and I need you to say yes.

33:08.946 --> 33:10.156
I've been robbed.

33:10.239 --> 33:12.700
- You have.
- Yes, by you.

33:12.784 --> 33:16.329
4:15 this morning, bank accounts
belonging to me and my family,

33:16.412 --> 33:18.790
my associates, all emptied.

33:18.873 --> 33:21.751
- American hackers.
- Sit, please.

33:21.834 --> 33:24.420
- Where is my money?
- You want my help? Sit down.

33:30.927 --> 33:33.221
What do you want?

33:33.304 --> 33:34.597
I want Simone Martin.

33:34.681 --> 33:38.810
- I don't have her.
- That's true. Yevgeny does.

33:38.893 --> 33:41.813
- So? Ask him.
- He'd say no.

33:41.896 --> 33:44.023
That's why I'm asking you.

33:44.107 --> 33:46.234
Fuck you, Saul.

33:46.317 --> 33:49.320
Fine, fuck me.
This is what happens

33:49.404 --> 33:51.989
when the gloves come off
while you're cursing me,

33:52.073 --> 33:54.450
the awkward position
I've put you in.

33:54.534 --> 33:56.452
Remember, I did not
start this.

33:56.536 --> 33:59.122
- Neither did I.
- No, your countrymen did.

33:59.205 --> 34:01.207
They left bodies,

34:01.290 --> 34:03.459
dead on the ground,

34:03.543 --> 34:05.503
in America.

34:05.586 --> 34:09.716
They left
our president damaged,

34:09.799 --> 34:11.509
about to be deposed.

34:11.592 --> 34:14.262
- This is what you believe.
- I don't believe. I know.

34:14.345 --> 34:16.973
And I'm sick of it,
your bullshit. All of you.

34:18.683 --> 34:21.936
Give me Simone Martin,
you get your money back.

34:22.019 --> 34:24.981
Or swear to God,
this is only the start.

35:17.366 --> 35:19.786
He says he never
heard of her.

35:35.092 --> 35:38.429
He's leaving the hotel.
We're tracking south.

35:38.513 --> 35:41.098
He's got Moscow police
clearing a route for him

35:41.182 --> 35:43.392
- back to Yasenevo.
- What's Yasenevo?

35:43.476 --> 35:46.270
<i>His home base. SVR Headquarters.</i>

35:48.314 --> 35:49.732
What do you
think he's doing?

35:49.816 --> 35:51.609
Well, he sure lost interest
in the conference.

35:51.692 --> 35:54.070
What Saul said
made an impression.

35:54.153 --> 35:55.905
Mirov's delegation's
ready downstairs.

35:55.988 --> 35:57.824
Saul wants to know
when to expect you.

35:57.907 --> 35:59.992
Uh, tell him
I'm staying here.

36:13.840 --> 36:16.884
So Yevgeny's not joining us?

36:25.309 --> 36:27.061
Sorry to hear that.

36:30.147 --> 36:31.816
Not feeling well.

36:33.150 --> 36:34.694
General Yakushin?

36:40.992 --> 36:43.452
What do you mean?

37:16.027 --> 37:19.864
You were right.
There he is, back at home base.

37:19.947 --> 37:22.491
You think he's got a plan?

37:22.575 --> 37:25.369
Yakushin always has a plan.
Who are they?

37:26.621 --> 37:29.081
- Can't tell.
- Can you enlarge?

37:29.165 --> 37:31.500
Um, no, not much.

37:33.920 --> 37:37.131
Lost them. We've got no coverage
inside the building.

37:37.214 --> 37:39.342
- Hey.
- Where were you?
I've been calling.

37:39.425 --> 37:41.594
Sorry. Did anything happen?

37:41.677 --> 37:44.347
Yeah, lots. Someone
tipped off the Russians.

37:44.430 --> 37:46.766
- What?
- Plan "A" at the dacha

37:46.849 --> 37:49.310
went to shit.
Team walked into a trap.

37:49.393 --> 37:52.772
Two casualties,
one on each side.

37:52.855 --> 37:54.315
We're on to Plan "B" now.

37:54.398 --> 37:57.693
Go after Yakushin,
get him to cough up Simone.

38:00.738 --> 38:03.157
- What's that?
- Yakushin's headquarters.

38:03.240 --> 38:05.743
No, no. That.

38:05.826 --> 38:07.411
Carrie? You seeing this?

38:07.495 --> 38:08.913
Yeah, I am.

38:16.462 --> 38:18.631
<i>- What do you think?</i>
- 30 men loaded for bear

38:18.714 --> 38:21.384
less than an hour after Saul
squeezed Yakushin's balls?

38:21.467 --> 38:23.678
We said get Simone.
That's what he's doing.

38:28.224 --> 38:31.519
Okay, they're on the move.
We're tracking.

38:51.497 --> 38:53.207
- You ready?
- Yeah.

38:53.290 --> 38:55.835
Max, switch to mobile.
We're heading out.

39:07.263 --> 39:09.473
<i>Where are they?</i>

39:09.557 --> 39:10.808
About a half-mile
from you.

39:10.891 --> 39:12.435
<i>Any idea
where they're going?</i>

39:12.518 --> 39:15.354
- No, not yet.
- Yeah, maybe.

39:15.438 --> 39:17.398
He's headed right at Mirov.

39:17.481 --> 39:19.984
Mirov's at the hotel.

39:20.067 --> 39:22.528
I mean, Mirov's headquarters,
the G.R.U. building.

39:22.611 --> 39:24.488
He has a secure suite
there.

39:24.572 --> 39:26.282
Top floor,
safest place in Moscow.

39:26.365 --> 39:28.826
You think that's where
they moved her?

39:28.909 --> 39:30.953
Yakushin obviously does.

39:31.037 --> 39:34.081
- Bennet, you hear that?
- G.R.U.

40:24.381 --> 40:27.384
Something wrong?

40:27.468 --> 40:29.553
The colonel apologizes.

41:24.942 --> 41:27.736
Get away from the window.

41:27.820 --> 41:29.446
Come on.

41:29.530 --> 41:32.366
So, they are
looking for me.

41:33.909 --> 41:35.161
What did Mirov say?

41:35.244 --> 41:36.745
He'll, uh,
call the Kremlin.

41:36.829 --> 41:38.289
And what will the Kremlin say?

41:38.372 --> 41:40.791
Don't worry.
You'll be safe here.

41:43.586 --> 41:45.504
No one can touch you.

41:49.550 --> 41:52.386
- I'll leave the guards outside.
- Where are you going?

41:52.469 --> 41:55.389
- Gotta sort this out.
- Stay.

41:55.472 --> 41:57.766
Let Mirov deal with this.

41:57.850 --> 42:01.395
He is the one who let it
all happen.

42:03.147 --> 42:06.984
Bolt the door. Don't let
anybody in but me, yeah?

42:23.500 --> 42:26.086
Oh, shit. Shit! Holy shit.

42:43.687 --> 42:45.856
Okay, we need to put this
out on the Internet,

42:45.940 --> 42:47.650
like Yevgeny would do it.

42:47.733 --> 42:50.152
Use CCTV footage,
tourist videos,

42:50.236 --> 42:51.612
whatever you can grab.

42:51.695 --> 42:54.782
Make it sound like the whole
country's melting down.

42:56.242 --> 42:58.702
- Come on.
- What?

42:58.786 --> 43:00.871
Put it out.
Use Yevgeny's network.

43:00.955 --> 43:02.456
W-We shut it down.

43:02.539 --> 43:04.500
The bots are still there.

43:04.583 --> 43:06.961
- Come on! Come on!
<i>- Max?</i>

43:07.044 --> 43:08.796
- Yeah.
- We're moving.

44:09.148 --> 44:10.941
Excuse me.

44:13.610 --> 44:14.820
Sir?

44:14.903 --> 44:16.822
- Senator.
- You need to see this.

44:18.115 --> 44:20.242
<i>There is chaos right now
in Moscow,</i>

44:20.326 --> 44:23.454
<i>where elements of Russia's
intelligence apparatus are</i>

44:23.537 --> 44:24.872
<i>involved in an armed standoff</i>

44:24.955 --> 44:26.623
<i>less than a mile
from the Kremlin...</i>

44:26.707 --> 44:29.335
- What is this?
- We started it.

44:29.418 --> 44:30.961
- What?
- Keane did,

44:31.045 --> 44:32.338
just before
she stepped down.

44:32.421 --> 44:34.381
Sent a covert operation
over there

44:34.465 --> 44:36.592
headed by Saul Berenson.
I just had

44:36.675 --> 44:39.053
the Russian ambassador
screaming at me on the phone.

44:39.136 --> 44:41.180
Oh.

44:41.263 --> 44:43.432
You have to stop it.

44:43.515 --> 44:45.476
Stop that?

44:45.559 --> 44:46.935
How?

44:47.019 --> 44:50.689
Declare Berenson a rogue
operator, disown him publicly,

44:50.773 --> 44:52.274
or you're gonna have
the Russians

44:52.358 --> 44:55.069
coming after you for this
20 minutes into your watch.

45:02.701 --> 45:04.578
- Max, are you there?
- Yeah.

45:04.661 --> 45:06.288
I'm on the eighth floor.
The security badge doesn't work.

45:06.372 --> 45:07.790
Do I go back down?

45:07.873 --> 45:10.376
No, no. You're-you're
in the right place.

45:10.459 --> 45:15.089
Okay, there should be
an opening to your left.

45:15.172 --> 45:17.800
<i>You see the opening?</i>

45:25.599 --> 45:28.268
<i>There should be a door at the end of it.</i>

45:28.352 --> 45:29.770
Yeah.

45:47.538 --> 45:48.747
Where's this go?

45:48.831 --> 45:50.457
You're nearly there.

45:57.840 --> 46:01.343
Carrie, hold on a second.

46:01.427 --> 46:03.178
You can't be serious.

46:08.976 --> 46:11.437
You have
a better suggestion?

46:11.520 --> 46:12.980
Yeah, me neither.

46:31.123 --> 46:33.208
- I see a balcony.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

46:33.292 --> 46:36.712
That leads to the suite.
You okay, Carrie?

46:40.591 --> 46:42.509
Carrie, they're up
to the third floor.

46:42.593 --> 46:44.219
<i>You've gotta keep moving.</i>

47:09.328 --> 47:10.787
Carrie?

47:15.834 --> 47:17.419
Carrie, they're up
to the fourth floor.

47:17.503 --> 47:19.046
Now you have
maybe five minutes.

47:54.873 --> 47:56.375
I made it.

48:30.242 --> 48:33.161
Put your gun down.

48:41.253 --> 48:44.798
So, this whole crazy thing
is you?

48:44.881 --> 48:48.010
Wait. Wait, you-you know
what's happening outside.

48:48.093 --> 48:49.469
They're here for you.

48:49.553 --> 48:51.722
Yevgeny will never
give me up.

48:51.805 --> 48:54.641
You think that's what it's even
about anymore, giving you up?

48:54.725 --> 48:57.644
The world is watching.
The Kremlin has lost control.

48:57.728 --> 48:59.313
You are the problem.

48:59.396 --> 49:00.981
What do you think
they'll do?

49:04.443 --> 49:06.153
They'll make the general
back down.

49:06.236 --> 49:08.905
Does it sound like
that's what's happening?

49:11.783 --> 49:14.036
Mirov is probably talking
to Yevgeny right now.

49:14.119 --> 49:16.872
- Stop.
- He's having <i>the</i> conversation.

49:16.955 --> 49:20.417
Yevgeny's saying you're loyal.
You've done great things.

49:20.500 --> 49:22.377
But Mirov is painting
the big picture,

49:22.461 --> 49:24.171
and in the big picture,

49:24.254 --> 49:26.298
you are expendable.

49:27.758 --> 49:30.010
You don't know Yevgeny.

49:30.093 --> 49:33.430
I know he killed Ivan Krupin
and Clayton and Dante Allen--

49:33.513 --> 49:34.681
his people.

49:34.765 --> 49:36.975
He killed them when
they became a problem,

49:37.059 --> 49:40.896
and that is what
you are right now.

49:40.979 --> 49:43.148
He'll walk in here,
and he'll tell you

49:43.231 --> 49:45.275
everything's gonna be
all right, and then...

49:45.359 --> 49:47.486
- You're wrong.
- Only, I'm not,

49:47.569 --> 49:50.906
because we both know
that is the deal we make

49:50.989 --> 49:52.240
in the work we do.

50:05.420 --> 50:08.340
Simone?

50:08.423 --> 50:10.509
Simone, time to move.

50:10.592 --> 50:12.844
There's a path
through the basement.

50:14.680 --> 50:18.558
Simone, there's a car waiting.
Open the door.

50:18.642 --> 50:19.935
Simone?

50:23.563 --> 50:25.315
Open the door.

51:21.413 --> 51:25.292
You good?

51:25.375 --> 51:27.335
Yeah.

51:42.559 --> 51:45.270
Keep down, okay?
