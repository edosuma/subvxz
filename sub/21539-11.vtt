00:04.938 --> 00:06.439
(Luis)
I want to relist this house.

00:06.473 --> 00:08.742
It's gorgeous.
It's big.

00:08.775 --> 00:10.076
Let me bring you
an offer.

00:10.110 --> 00:12.812
I'm afraid I got you
a $3.5 million offer.

00:12.846 --> 00:15.081
We knew that
you could do it, Luis.

00:15.115 --> 00:17.617
- What is the sellout here?
- $300 million.

00:17.650 --> 00:18.718
Wow.

00:18.752 --> 00:20.687
Everything with a color
is sold.

00:20.720 --> 00:22.789
Where are you now?
Have you found a mother?

00:22.822 --> 00:24.157
The one that I'm at least

00:24.190 --> 00:26.459
putting a lot of
my hopes in is Anna.

00:26.493 --> 00:28.294
I just cannot do it
right now.

00:28.328 --> 00:30.296
I'm really, really sorry.

00:30.330 --> 00:31.731
They want me to move
to Geneva.

00:31.765 --> 00:32.966
To Geneva?

00:32.999 --> 00:34.834
Like, full-time.

00:34.868 --> 00:36.169

[upbeat music]

00:39.372 --> 00:41.408
(Ryan)
My motto is expansion,

00:41.441 --> 00:44.444
always in all ways.

00:44.477 --> 00:47.013
(Luis)
New York City,
it's the most exciting city

00:47.047 --> 00:48.948
for real estate,
and that's why I'm here.

00:48.982 --> 00:51.284
(Fredrik)
I'm the closer
and a listing machine.

00:51.317 --> 00:53.887
What makes me better is that
I work harder than anyone else.

00:53.920 --> 00:54.954
Whee!

00:54.988 --> 00:56.790
We're friends now,
right?

00:56.823 --> 00:59.159
I don't need him,
and you don't either.

00:59.192 --> 01:00.960
This will never end.

01:01.061 --> 01:05.432
* *

01:13.106 --> 01:16.476
Alberto, is it okay if I call
you "Big Al" from now on?

01:16.509 --> 01:17.711
That's fine.

01:17.744 --> 01:19.546
- Okay, Big Al?
- Yes.

01:19.579 --> 01:21.781
Can you take me
to 290 West in Tribeca?

01:21.815 --> 01:22.782
Okay.

01:22.816 --> 01:24.217
It's Zach's new building.

01:24.250 --> 01:25.385
- Zach. Hey.
- Hey, there.

01:25.418 --> 01:26.786
Give me a hug.

01:26.820 --> 01:28.455
There's no developer
that I've worked more with

01:28.488 --> 01:29.789
than Zach Vella.

01:29.823 --> 01:31.758
Total building's about
51,000 square feet.

01:31.791 --> 01:35.562
We're talking about
$180 million sellouts.

01:35.595 --> 01:36.629
Cha-ching!

01:36.663 --> 01:37.931
I love you.

01:37.964 --> 01:39.366
Now, a dozen projects later,

01:39.399 --> 01:41.634
I can only imagine that
he would come to me first

01:41.668 --> 01:44.170
when he has
a new project.

01:44.204 --> 01:48.108
290 West is not only Tribeca,
it is waterfront Tribeca,

01:48.141 --> 01:51.444
right on the Hudson River.

01:51.478 --> 01:53.680
What most people don't know
is that the Hudson River Park,

01:53.713 --> 01:56.282
which is right across
the street from this building,

01:56.316 --> 02:00.286
is the longest waterfront park
in all of the United States.

02:04.824 --> 02:07.494
- Thank you, sir.
- You're welcome.

02:07.527 --> 02:09.729
Zach?

02:11.765 --> 02:12.966
Zach, where are you?

02:13.066 --> 02:14.567
As of last week...

02:14.601 --> 02:17.237
I have officially
sold out half, 50%,

02:17.270 --> 02:19.339
of my project
at the Beekman.

02:19.372 --> 02:21.107
But the Beekman
is just one ball,

02:21.141 --> 02:23.476
and I like to juggle balls.

02:23.510 --> 02:24.477
Oh!

02:24.511 --> 02:26.413
Lots of projects
all at once.

02:26.446 --> 02:27.947
Sell, sell, sell.

02:27.981 --> 02:29.716
Oh, there you are.

02:29.749 --> 02:31.551
- Hi.
- Get a hug.

02:31.584 --> 02:32.952
You ready for this one?

02:32.986 --> 02:35.255
Oh, my goodness.

02:35.288 --> 02:36.489
These views!

02:36.523 --> 02:39.259
[upbeat music]

02:39.292 --> 02:41.728
290 West is amazing.

02:41.761 --> 02:44.731
The lower part of the building
has ten apartments,

02:44.764 --> 02:46.166
two units per floor,

02:46.199 --> 02:48.101
the A line and the B line.

02:48.134 --> 02:50.904
The A line will be
2,500 square feet

02:50.937 --> 02:53.707
with four bedrooms
and four bathrooms.

02:53.740 --> 02:56.343
This entire thing is one
beautiful, big living room,

02:56.376 --> 02:58.378
with the corner,
glass meeting glass.

02:58.411 --> 03:00.046
That's incredible.

03:00.046 --> 03:02.248
The B line
is a little bit smaller,

03:02.282 --> 03:04.617
2,241 square feet.

03:04.651 --> 03:08.054
It's a three bedroom,
3 1/2 bath.

03:08.054 --> 03:09.189
Bed right here.

03:09.222 --> 03:12.258
So basically, I sit up
and this is what I see.

03:12.292 --> 03:14.427
But the lower floors
are just the beginning.

03:14.461 --> 03:19.065
On the top, you have three huge,
beautiful penthouses.

03:19.065 --> 03:21.067
Two of the penthouses
are duplexes,

03:21.067 --> 03:22.469
almost identical.

03:22.502 --> 03:23.937
The ceilings are crazy.

03:23.970 --> 03:25.071
We're finishing them
at this height.

03:25.105 --> 03:27.273
- So they're gonna be 12-feet.
- Wow.

03:27.307 --> 03:28.641
And you have
the Statue of Liberty

03:28.675 --> 03:29.642
from every room.

03:29.676 --> 03:32.879
Finally,
at the very top,

03:32.912 --> 03:35.382
the mega penthouse.

03:35.415 --> 03:41.121
* *

03:41.154 --> 03:45.759
The entire full floor with
ceilings as high as 22 feet.

03:45.792 --> 03:47.093
Even I will feel short.

03:47.093 --> 03:49.329
The finishes are perfection.

03:49.362 --> 03:51.431
And then,
are you ready for this?

03:51.464 --> 03:54.401
1,600 square feet
of private rooftop terrace

03:54.434 --> 03:56.369
with a swimming pool.

03:56.403 --> 03:57.737
I think
I'm getting aroused.

03:57.771 --> 03:59.773
Um...

04:03.276 --> 04:06.880
What are you thinking
for pricing?

04:06.913 --> 04:07.947
2,900?

04:08.048 --> 04:11.084
2,900...

04:13.853 --> 04:15.822
They can build
a thousand new buildings

04:15.855 --> 04:17.157
all over Manhattan,

04:17.190 --> 04:19.826
but there are no more sites
on the river

04:19.859 --> 04:22.395
where every single room--
glass, glass, glass--

04:22.429 --> 04:26.066
is facing park, river,
city views.

04:26.066 --> 04:27.567
This will never get blocked.

04:27.600 --> 04:30.403
These water views
are just priceless.

04:30.437 --> 04:32.238
You know what, Zach?

04:32.272 --> 04:35.608
I can't believe
I'm saying this.

04:35.642 --> 04:37.277
I'm gonna get you more.

04:39.913 --> 04:41.648
You're actually
talking me up in price?

04:41.681 --> 04:45.552
I think I am, actually.

04:45.585 --> 04:47.087
How much more
are you thinking?

04:47.087 --> 04:48.988
3,100 a foot, blended.

04:49.089 --> 04:51.491
We're gonna start around, like,
2,300 a foot at the lowest,

04:51.524 --> 04:54.294
and we're gonna go up to
5,000 a foot for the penthouse.

04:54.327 --> 04:55.562
That's a big price.

04:55.595 --> 04:57.263
For that really high price,
you know what I need?

04:57.297 --> 04:59.099
A scale model, I need
the kitchen and bathrooms,

04:59.132 --> 05:01.701
I need lots
of beautiful renderings.

05:01.735 --> 05:04.070
We have a very different
philosophy on that.

05:04.104 --> 05:05.572
I'd rather put the money
into the building.

05:05.605 --> 05:08.041
If I had bad floor plans,
if I didn't have these views,

05:08.074 --> 05:10.176
I'd build
a $2 million sales center

05:10.210 --> 05:12.245
like some of the other buildings
that I'm competing against.

05:12.278 --> 05:13.747
You're gonna have a building
to walk around in.

05:13.780 --> 05:15.949
This isn't, you know,
off a plan and it's--

05:16.049 --> 05:17.684
Yeah, but I just told you
3,100 a foot,

05:17.717 --> 05:20.153
and then you're saying
I'm not getting any tools.

05:20.186 --> 05:22.222
I think I need
to introduce Zach

05:22.255 --> 05:24.090
to my developer
at the Beekman.

05:28.294 --> 05:32.198
There's a reason why that
project is already 50% sold.

05:32.232 --> 05:35.969
Okay, 3,100 it is,
blended average--

05:36.069 --> 05:38.905
a record--
with no tools.

05:40.073 --> 05:41.741
I need to get started.

05:41.775 --> 05:44.744
[upbeat music]

05:44.778 --> 05:47.080
* *

05:47.113 --> 05:51.251
SoHo is kind of like the
Iggy Azalea of New York City.

05:51.284 --> 05:53.787
It's so fancy.

05:53.820 --> 05:56.256
You got fancy people,
fancy restaurants,

05:56.289 --> 05:59.159
fancy shops,
and, of course...

05:59.192 --> 06:02.028
fancy loft apartments.

06:02.028 --> 06:05.465
* *

06:05.498 --> 06:06.933
- Hello.
- Come on in.

06:07.033 --> 06:09.369
But my listing
appointment today

06:09.402 --> 06:12.539
is not a loft.

06:12.572 --> 06:15.342
It's a freestanding
townhouse...

06:15.375 --> 06:16.810
Wow.

06:16.843 --> 06:18.411
In SoHo.

06:18.445 --> 06:19.512
- I'm Ryan.
- Roger.

06:19.546 --> 06:20.580
Good to meet you.

06:20.613 --> 06:23.416
Places like this
just don't exist.

06:23.450 --> 06:26.319
This is not what I was
anticipating.

06:26.353 --> 06:27.787
- You want to show me around?
- Sure.

06:33.860 --> 06:36.663
Roger is a commercial
real-estate developer.

06:36.696 --> 06:38.798
He bought this place
in the late '90s,

06:38.832 --> 06:42.369
and he spent three years
renovating it before moving in.

06:42.402 --> 06:45.071
It's like a Zen oasis
out here.

06:45.071 --> 06:51.144
* *

06:51.177 --> 06:52.212
Whoa.

06:52.245 --> 06:54.147
It can house
multiple participants.

06:54.180 --> 06:55.248
Yeah.

06:55.281 --> 06:56.716
For people who are
into that kind of stuff.

06:56.750 --> 06:57.717
Yep.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.185
Awesome.

06:59.219 --> 07:01.354
I did do my homework,

07:01.388 --> 07:04.190
and you have
about 2,500 square feet

07:04.224 --> 07:05.625
of air rights here.

07:05.658 --> 07:08.595
So you could put another three
floors on top of this house.

07:08.628 --> 07:11.398
If you own
what are called air rights,

07:11.431 --> 07:15.502
that means that you have
the right to build up

07:15.535 --> 07:17.470
on top of a building.

07:17.504 --> 07:21.675
So air rights can be
very, very, very valuable

07:21.708 --> 07:23.910
to the right person.

07:23.943 --> 07:26.279
So you're moving
because you've outgrown it.

07:26.312 --> 07:27.447
Correct.

07:27.480 --> 07:28.948
But you're also
in the real-estate business,

07:29.049 --> 07:30.917
so I'm sure you've preplanned
this a little bit.

07:30.950 --> 07:32.886
We've contemplated
building it out.

07:32.919 --> 07:34.821
I just don't want to interfere
with my day job,

07:34.854 --> 07:36.589
and, candidly,
that would become my job.

07:36.623 --> 07:39.392
That's not something
I really want to do.

07:39.426 --> 07:40.460
What are you thinking?

07:40.493 --> 07:42.429
I'm thinking
a significant number.

07:44.664 --> 07:46.332
11 1/2 million, 12 million.

07:50.370 --> 07:52.939
If I got out
at 11 1/2 million, 12 million,

07:52.972 --> 07:55.408
people are going to look at it,
and they're going to say,

07:55.442 --> 07:57.677
"Wow, let me break it down."

07:57.711 --> 07:59.879
Roger's townhouse
is already built

07:59.913 --> 08:02.382
to about 3,500 square feet.

08:02.415 --> 08:06.119
And with the extra
2,500 square feet of air rights,

08:06.152 --> 08:07.921
if someone wanted to

08:08.021 --> 08:12.025
they could build
a 6,000-square-foot house.

08:12.058 --> 08:14.094
At $12 million,

08:14.127 --> 08:16.429
Roger is essentially
asking a buyer

08:16.463 --> 08:19.065
to pay the same
price per square foot

08:19.099 --> 08:21.101
of actual built house

08:21.134 --> 08:24.738
and 2,500 square feet
of air.

08:24.771 --> 08:25.939
There's a lot
of brokers out there

08:26.039 --> 08:27.040
that would just agree
and say,

08:27.073 --> 08:28.274
"You know what?
Let's do it.

08:28.308 --> 08:29.542
You're right, you're right,
you're right."

08:29.576 --> 08:31.644
Two months from now,
they sit down with you--

08:31.678 --> 08:34.047
"You know, I don't know,
I guess we're just overpriced."

08:34.047 --> 08:35.181
And then they're gonna
have to lower it,

08:35.215 --> 08:36.716
and that's not
where you want to be.

08:36.750 --> 08:39.519
I need to make this look
like it's a deal,

08:39.552 --> 08:41.888
so that people who are
out there looking at, you know,

08:41.921 --> 08:44.157
two-, three-bedroom condos

08:44.190 --> 08:45.658
all of a sudden
see this come on and say,

08:45.692 --> 08:46.760
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

08:46.793 --> 08:50.563
I can get an entire
private house in SoHo?"

08:54.300 --> 08:56.202
10 million flat.

08:56.236 --> 09:00.006
And then my job
is to bid it back up.

09:01.741 --> 09:03.209
You're talking
about going out

09:03.243 --> 09:05.512
with an asking of 10 million,
but getting to a higher number?

09:05.545 --> 09:07.313
If you're open to that.

09:07.347 --> 09:09.482
[dramatic music]

09:09.516 --> 09:11.618
I'm okay with that...

09:11.651 --> 09:13.119
only with the understanding

09:13.153 --> 09:15.021
that we're looking to get
significantly more than that.

09:15.021 --> 09:16.056
Deal.

09:19.826 --> 09:22.162
Get ready.
It's gonna be crazy.

09:22.195 --> 09:24.097
Yeah, put the wine down.

09:26.299 --> 09:29.269
[gentle music]

09:29.302 --> 09:36.142
* *

09:36.176 --> 09:38.812
[doorbell rings]

09:38.845 --> 09:40.347
Thanks for coming over.

09:40.380 --> 09:42.816
Of course.

09:42.849 --> 09:44.818
Ricky, Ricky,
get over here.

09:44.851 --> 09:46.052
This is Ricky Ricardo.

09:46.052 --> 09:47.821
- Mr. Ricardo.
- He really calls you Ricky.

09:47.854 --> 09:49.856
- He does call me Ricky.
- I'm telling everyone.

09:49.889 --> 09:52.325
Listen, I have let you call me
Ricky Ricardo all you want.

09:52.359 --> 09:54.160
You have some
explaining to do, Ricky.

09:54.194 --> 09:55.795
Lucy, Lucy!

09:55.829 --> 09:58.565
Ian is...

09:58.598 --> 10:01.201
a very big pain

10:01.234 --> 10:03.069
in the ass.

10:03.103 --> 10:05.972
But he's also
a very big client.

10:06.006 --> 10:07.073
11.95 million.
We're gonna do it with you.

10:07.107 --> 10:08.408
Are we doing this?

10:08.441 --> 10:09.843
You're gonna get
your f***ing deal!

10:09.876 --> 10:11.211
We have a deal.
You're a witness.

10:11.244 --> 10:12.912
Last year,
I closed what was then

10:12.946 --> 10:15.181
my biggest deal of my career,

10:15.215 --> 10:17.250
right here in this building,
230 Central Park South.

10:22.655 --> 10:25.125
Really?

10:27.761 --> 10:29.329
Oh, my God,
what a mess here.

10:29.362 --> 10:30.764
- Mess?
- Oh, my God.

10:30.797 --> 10:32.399
This is the problem
with construction sites.

10:32.432 --> 10:34.768
Fredrik, I'm not sure
I can make it.

10:46.713 --> 10:48.548
(Luis)
Last year Ian and I sold

10:48.581 --> 10:50.417
a combined apartment
on the 11th floor

10:50.450 --> 10:52.619
here at
230 Central Park South.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.287
The view hasn't changed.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.690
And Ian still holds
the keys to a lot of apartments

10:56.723 --> 10:59.159
here in this building.

10:59.192 --> 11:01.961
My long-term mission
has been to combine

11:02.062 --> 11:04.197
numerous contiguous
neighboring apartments

11:04.230 --> 11:06.299
to create larger,
more valuable,

11:06.332 --> 11:08.802
more glamorous
large apartments.

11:08.835 --> 11:11.271
Higher price and higher price
per square foot.

11:11.304 --> 11:12.939
So I've been thinking

11:12.972 --> 11:15.508
that it's time we do business
together again.

11:17.877 --> 11:20.914
Well, listen, Ian,
as much as I enjoyed

11:20.947 --> 11:25.118
working on this project
last year,

11:25.151 --> 11:27.620
I think if we work
together again,

11:27.654 --> 11:29.756
it would have
to be treated...

11:32.892 --> 11:36.096
This dog is peeing
in the floor!

11:36.096 --> 11:37.364
So handsome,
you could be gay.

11:37.397 --> 11:38.365
I'm straight.

11:38.398 --> 11:40.233
Oh, yeah,
straight to my bed.

11:40.266 --> 11:41.935
I'm a much different
person today.

11:44.104 --> 11:45.772
You want me to pick up
your dry cleaning?

11:45.805 --> 11:48.608
And I will not allow anyone
to disrespect me

11:48.641 --> 11:50.110
the way he did before.

11:50.110 --> 11:52.312
Can I still call you
Ricky Ricardo?

11:52.345 --> 11:54.514
Why don't we just
stay with Luis.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.716
Oh, Mr. Ortiz.

11:56.750 --> 11:58.351
Yes, Mr. Ortiz,
I like that.

11:58.385 --> 12:00.553
[electronic music]

12:00.587 --> 12:02.322
This stretch along
Central Park South

12:02.355 --> 12:04.791
holds some of the most
valuable real estate

12:04.824 --> 12:06.292
in all of New York.

12:06.326 --> 12:09.062
Some luxury residences
in this area

12:09.062 --> 12:11.598
have traded for more
than $10,000 a foot.

12:11.631 --> 12:14.200
To your left,
you have Columbus Circle.

12:14.234 --> 12:16.169
You have 5th Avenue
on your right.

12:16.202 --> 12:17.737
But most importantly,

12:17.771 --> 12:21.574
you have Central Park
as your front yard.

12:21.608 --> 12:24.844
(Ian)
Let me show you what I've
put together for 2015.

12:27.080 --> 12:31.351
My latest assemblage,
12-A, 12-B, and 12-C.

12:31.384 --> 12:33.253
It's taken me many,
many years

12:33.286 --> 12:35.088
to accumulate
these three apartments,

12:35.088 --> 12:38.692
and now we have an amazing
3,000-square-foot apartment

12:38.725 --> 12:41.761
that can compete
with 15 Central Park West

12:41.795 --> 12:43.596
and 220 Central Park South.

12:43.630 --> 12:45.965
I would argue double the view
at half the price.

12:48.234 --> 12:49.469
In just a year or so,

12:49.502 --> 12:52.472
since I sold Ian's apartment
downstairs,

12:52.505 --> 12:54.541
billion-dollar towers
started popping up

12:54.574 --> 12:56.810
left and right
around this neighborhood.

12:56.843 --> 13:00.046
They are offering
the most sophisticated amenities

13:00.046 --> 13:02.115
the world has ever seen.

13:02.148 --> 13:04.884
This building,
it's very, very old,

13:04.918 --> 13:08.054
which makes it very hard
to compete.

13:13.827 --> 13:15.428
How many more windows you have

13:15.462 --> 13:17.797
if you break into
this apartment?

13:17.831 --> 13:20.567
If we were able to buy
the D unit,

13:20.600 --> 13:22.469
we'd have the entire width
of the building.

13:22.502 --> 13:26.773
We would have 75 foot
of park frontage.

13:26.806 --> 13:28.641
Having Central Park views

13:28.675 --> 13:33.446
is the most expensive amenity
there is.

13:33.480 --> 13:36.383
Now, imagine having 75 feet

13:36.416 --> 13:39.285
of Central Park views.

13:39.319 --> 13:42.155
That is the length
of a seven-story building,

13:42.188 --> 13:43.523
all glass,

13:43.556 --> 13:47.861
facing the most incredible view

13:47.894 --> 13:49.763
in all of Manhattan.

13:49.796 --> 13:51.598
This is something
that nobody has.

13:51.631 --> 13:54.367
Even the building next door
will never have an apartment

13:54.401 --> 13:55.935
with 75 feet of frontage.

13:55.969 --> 13:58.538
Have you looked
into buying the apartments

13:58.571 --> 14:00.674
in the entire floor?

14:03.043 --> 14:05.945
I like the concept of trying
to acquire an entire floor,

14:06.046 --> 14:10.150
but that basically means
we'd have to vacate two owners.

14:10.183 --> 14:12.852
But if we took down
the walls of the hallway

14:12.886 --> 14:14.387
and we get off the elevator

14:14.421 --> 14:19.259
and folks walk right into
a 5,000-square-foot apartment...

14:19.292 --> 14:21.227
That is a huge
marketing angle.

14:21.261 --> 14:22.228
I mean,
this is serious stuff.

14:22.262 --> 14:24.564
The layout
would be phenomenal.

14:24.597 --> 14:26.733
What do you think we could ask
for that apartment?

14:34.874 --> 14:36.209
25 million.

14:37.877 --> 14:41.081
$25 million
is a lot of money.

14:41.081 --> 14:43.717
But for the right buyer,
it's actually a bargain.

14:43.750 --> 14:46.686
The building next door,
it's double that.

14:46.720 --> 14:48.088
If we want to go after
the whole floor,

14:48.088 --> 14:49.422
let me give you
a little road map.

14:49.456 --> 14:50.757
I own 12 A, B, C.

14:50.790 --> 14:52.992
One owner owns
one apartment, 12-D.

14:53.093 --> 14:54.594
I believe that one
is "overcomeable."

14:54.627 --> 14:56.463
One owner
owns 12-E, F.

14:56.496 --> 14:57.697
The guy is never in town.

14:57.731 --> 14:59.799
I don't even know
if we could track him down,

14:59.833 --> 15:02.102
yet alone
get him to sell.

15:02.135 --> 15:03.703
That's what I'm here for.

15:08.408 --> 15:10.844
And the pricing could get
prohibitively expensive.

15:10.877 --> 15:12.612
This is a buyout.

15:12.645 --> 15:16.049
I can remember the last guy
in 15 Central Park West

15:16.049 --> 15:17.951
was a holdout
and got $13 million

15:18.051 --> 15:21.221
so Zeckendorf could vacate
that whole building.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.056
Buyouts are very difficult,

15:23.056 --> 15:25.325
because the sellers
have all the power.

15:25.358 --> 15:28.895
They know that if
they refuse to leave,

15:28.928 --> 15:30.563
the developers are f***ed.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.899
As long as we could
contain the cost

15:32.932 --> 15:34.334
we pay for those two units

15:34.367 --> 15:37.070
to something
around $6 million,

15:37.070 --> 15:40.874
I think we're
onto something.

15:40.907 --> 15:42.475
I will strategically
come up with a plan

15:42.509 --> 15:45.078
to make sure that everybody
gets bought out the right way.

15:45.078 --> 15:46.413
This is sounding interesting.

15:46.446 --> 15:47.814
This is the kind of stuff
I like to roll the dice with.

15:47.847 --> 15:49.983
Are you in?

15:52.385 --> 15:53.953
We got a deal.

15:53.987 --> 15:56.990
Let's go buy
this entire floor.

16:09.869 --> 16:11.905
Ugh.

16:11.938 --> 16:13.673
- Fredrik.
- Hi.

16:13.707 --> 16:15.342
Charlie O'May.

16:15.375 --> 16:17.177
It's a little cold!

16:17.210 --> 16:19.512
Mwah, mwah.
Are you ready?

16:19.546 --> 16:20.513
Thank you, sir.

16:20.547 --> 16:21.848
Keep it on.
Let's go up.

16:21.881 --> 16:24.951
Zach might not have given me
a showroom for 290 West.

16:25.051 --> 16:27.554
But you know what?
He gave me amazing renderings.

16:27.587 --> 16:30.757
And those renderings
are luring the buyers in.

16:30.790 --> 16:32.158
So this is our lobby,

16:32.192 --> 16:34.227
and all the mechanicals,
AC, everything's in the roof.

16:34.260 --> 16:36.262
But no matter how amazing
the renderings are,

16:36.296 --> 16:40.066
there's only one real way
to actually sell the views,

16:40.100 --> 16:42.535
which is to bring people
up in the building.

16:42.569 --> 16:44.637
So here we are.

16:45.939 --> 16:47.774
Oh, no, no, no.
I know that face.

16:47.807 --> 16:49.376
I've seen that face before.

16:49.409 --> 16:51.111
It's a construction site.
It's dirty.

16:51.144 --> 16:52.946
We have to walk one floor up.
Come with me.

16:52.979 --> 16:56.916
We're coming up into
the seventh floor.

16:56.950 --> 16:59.919
This is the penthouse level.

17:02.589 --> 17:03.556
Incredible views.

17:03.590 --> 17:05.258
Oh, my God,
what a mess here.

17:05.291 --> 17:06.793
- Mess? Water?
- And the water.

17:06.826 --> 17:08.395
Oh, my gosh, okay.

17:08.428 --> 17:09.763
Watch the water.

17:09.796 --> 17:11.798
Look at the ceilings,
look at the ceilings.

17:11.831 --> 17:13.199
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God,

17:13.233 --> 17:14.367
the ceilings.

17:14.401 --> 17:15.435
Look at the openness.

17:15.468 --> 17:18.071
- Oh, my--
- So--Whoa, water.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.509
All right,
so we're west and north.

17:22.542 --> 17:24.144
No, no, no,
I want a reaction.

17:24.177 --> 17:26.346
We're coming into, like, the
most premier corner apartment

17:26.379 --> 17:28.148
in all of Tribeca,
all glass.

17:28.181 --> 17:31.317
Then you have
the 1,500-square-feet terrace

17:31.351 --> 17:32.619
wrapping around.

17:32.652 --> 17:34.788
Great.

17:34.821 --> 17:37.390
Fredrik, I'm not sure
I can make it.

17:37.424 --> 17:38.591
Look at that view.
Look at north.

17:38.625 --> 17:39.659
You see all of Uptown.

17:39.693 --> 17:42.662
And then you see this.
This is insane.

17:42.696 --> 17:44.064
- Oh.
- Oops.

17:44.064 --> 17:45.799
I think it's great, in theory,

17:45.832 --> 17:47.967
that Zach wants to save money
on a sales gallery

17:48.068 --> 17:50.070
and put the money into the
building and the construction,

17:50.070 --> 17:52.072
but this is the problem
with the construction site.

17:52.072 --> 17:53.940
If it was raining
the night before,

17:53.973 --> 17:55.742
you're gonna be
jumping over puddles.

17:55.775 --> 17:57.577
If there was a shipment
of lumber coming in,

17:57.610 --> 17:59.379
you're gonna be
jumping over 2x4s.

17:59.412 --> 18:02.215
I mean, it is so hard
to keep clients focused.

18:02.248 --> 18:04.150
So imagine, you and I
are standing here,

18:04.184 --> 18:05.618
and I'm chopping an onion.

18:05.652 --> 18:06.619
[imitates chopping]

18:06.653 --> 18:08.054
- [chuckles]
- Right?

18:08.088 --> 18:10.023
All right, I'm a little worried
about sound attenuation.

18:10.023 --> 18:11.291
Sound?

18:11.324 --> 18:12.592
You've got
the Westside Highway right here.

18:12.625 --> 18:13.860
No, no, it's like
special gaps in between.

18:13.893 --> 18:16.029
It's 30% higher performance
than any other pane.

18:16.029 --> 18:18.365
I mean, I have a sound study,
trust me.

18:18.398 --> 18:19.532
So what do you think
about the price,

18:19.566 --> 18:22.635
12.75 million?

18:22.669 --> 18:23.937
Well...

18:24.037 --> 18:25.305
I'm gonna run it by
my folks.

18:25.338 --> 18:28.041
They've got a real issue
imagining things.

18:28.041 --> 18:30.343
They're very suspicious
of buying off of renderings

18:30.377 --> 18:31.578
or off of a floor plan,

18:31.611 --> 18:34.447
even being
in a space like this.

18:34.481 --> 18:36.116
I know what Zach
is thinking.

18:36.149 --> 18:38.251
He's thinking that Fredrik
is some sort of miracle worker

18:38.284 --> 18:40.587
and that I'm just gonna
sell the building out

18:40.620 --> 18:42.155
like I've done
every other building.

18:42.188 --> 18:44.524
Fredrik, you didn't tell me
I should wear my sneakers.

18:44.557 --> 18:46.760
- I--
- Oh, you--you're fine.

18:46.793 --> 18:50.363
As good as I am,
buyers that are buying luxury,

18:50.397 --> 18:52.365
they want to be
in luxury environment.

18:52.399 --> 18:54.634
They don't want to, like, look
at these transportable

18:54.668 --> 18:56.603
poop machines.

18:56.636 --> 18:58.905
What are they called?
Portable what?

18:58.938 --> 19:00.140
It's adventurous.

19:00.173 --> 19:03.410
It is, but I don't have
my adventure outfits on.

19:03.443 --> 19:07.614
So if Zach doesn't give me
the tools that I need to sell,

19:07.647 --> 19:08.915
I'm gonna come up
with some myself.

19:09.015 --> 19:11.918
- Am I safe?
- Oh, you're so safe.

19:12.018 --> 19:14.921
[upbeat music]

19:15.021 --> 19:20.026
* *

19:20.060 --> 19:21.294
Hello!

19:24.531 --> 19:25.665
For you, sure.

19:25.699 --> 19:27.033
As soon as I got the listing

19:27.033 --> 19:28.702
for the townhouse
on Broome Street,

19:28.735 --> 19:30.937
I basically started
showing the place immediately.

19:31.037 --> 19:32.072
- Hello.
- Hey.

19:32.105 --> 19:33.406
- Nice to meet you.
- Thanks for coming.

19:33.440 --> 19:34.407
- Hello.
- Hello.

19:34.441 --> 19:36.176
I like to call this
the Zen garden.

19:36.209 --> 19:37.844
Look at this tub.
Call some lady friends.

19:37.877 --> 19:39.279
Yes, you can.

19:39.312 --> 19:41.815
(woman)
Wow, that is really cool.

19:41.848 --> 19:43.917
Take one of these,
bring 'em upstairs.

19:43.950 --> 19:46.820
Pretty much everybody
loved it.

19:46.853 --> 19:47.921
Ten.

19:47.954 --> 19:49.723
For a two bedroom,
3,400 square feet?

19:49.756 --> 19:51.224
That seems a little high.

19:51.257 --> 19:54.527
And pretty much everyone thought
it was way too expensive.

19:54.561 --> 19:57.163
You've got 2,600 square feet
of air rights.

19:57.197 --> 19:59.866
Tear this whole thing down
and build all the way back up.

20:01.234 --> 20:03.370
Turns out,
the average buyer

20:03.403 --> 20:06.506
isn't really all that interested
in building up.

20:06.539 --> 20:09.576
So, rather than
mass-market the place

20:09.609 --> 20:10.910
and doing open houses

20:10.944 --> 20:12.645
and showing it
to absolutely everyone...

20:12.679 --> 20:14.114
It's Ryan.
You have a second?

20:14.147 --> 20:17.250
I went and looked for
the best boutique developers

20:17.283 --> 20:19.919
who would actually see the value
in the air rights

20:19.953 --> 20:21.154
to build up.

20:21.187 --> 20:23.957
I think I might have
your next project for you.

20:25.959 --> 20:27.360
It's not landmarked.

20:27.394 --> 20:29.529
I think the potential here
is pretty wild.

20:29.562 --> 20:32.899
And because I'm awesome,
I found that guy.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.436
So I have an offer.

20:36.469 --> 20:40.907
It's from somebody who wants to
basically tear the house down,

20:40.940 --> 20:43.643
and they're
at 10.5 million.

20:46.946 --> 20:49.516
10.5 million
is a snore, Ryan.

20:52.152 --> 20:53.319
Look at her.

20:53.353 --> 20:55.388
She's so mean,
and she's so powerful,

20:55.422 --> 20:56.890
and she's so beautiful.

20:56.923 --> 20:59.893
Come on, what is it?

20:59.926 --> 21:01.461
You?

21:09.302 --> 21:12.072
(Ryan)
So I have an offer.

21:12.105 --> 21:16.409
It's from somebody who wants to
basically tear the house down,

21:16.443 --> 21:18.912
and they're
at 10.5 million.

21:22.215 --> 21:24.784
10.5 million
is a snore, Ryan.

21:24.818 --> 21:26.419
I mean, come on.

21:26.453 --> 21:29.823
That's $500,000
over the asking price.

21:29.856 --> 21:31.091
We sat in the kitchen,

21:31.091 --> 21:33.093
you convinced me to go down
to a lower number,

21:33.093 --> 21:35.195
which I agreed to,
reluctantly, by the way.

21:35.228 --> 21:36.796
Uh-huh.

21:36.830 --> 21:38.164
Just not that exciting.

21:39.766 --> 21:41.101
We shouldn't lose this guy.

21:41.101 --> 21:44.104
If 10.5 million isn't a number
that you want to do,

21:44.104 --> 21:45.772
I should go to him
right now and just say,

21:45.805 --> 21:48.141
"Listen, he's not gonna do
10.5 million.

21:48.174 --> 21:49.943
This is the number."

21:49.976 --> 21:52.012
Get me 11 million,

21:52.112 --> 21:54.581
and I'll even throw in
a pair of new socks for you.

21:54.614 --> 21:55.982
Oh, you are just so sweet.

21:56.016 --> 21:57.117
[line trilling]

21:57.150 --> 22:00.687
Pick up your f***ing phone.

22:00.720 --> 22:03.323
Hey, it's me, Ryan.

22:03.356 --> 22:06.059
I just presented
your offer of 10.5 million,

22:06.059 --> 22:08.928
and he's not gonna do it.

22:08.962 --> 22:13.366
If you want it,
the number is 11...

22:13.400 --> 22:15.335
million, yeah.

22:15.368 --> 22:16.703
This is still a good deal.

22:16.736 --> 22:20.774
We have 6,000 square feet
of buildable space in SoHo.

22:20.807 --> 22:22.942
And that's still less
than whatever your guys

22:22.976 --> 22:25.078
are looking at
in the West Village.

22:25.111 --> 22:27.614
That's still under
$1,900 a foot.

22:27.647 --> 22:29.482
That could possible be worth

22:29.516 --> 22:32.419
upwards of 3,000 when finished.

22:32.452 --> 22:34.087
Why would you not
buy this at 11 million

22:34.087 --> 22:36.756
if you could sell it
for well over 20 million?

22:39.092 --> 22:40.694
[sighs]

22:40.727 --> 22:43.830
The things I do
for people like you.

22:43.863 --> 22:44.998
Hold on.

22:45.098 --> 22:47.000
Let me just have a moment.

22:49.602 --> 22:51.371
They will absolutely do
$11 million,

22:51.404 --> 22:53.106
and we have a deal.

22:53.139 --> 22:54.507
11 million?

22:54.541 --> 22:55.575
Yes!

22:55.608 --> 22:56.643
Maybe you should have gone
for more.

22:56.676 --> 22:57.811
You think they'd pay
11.5 million?

22:57.844 --> 22:58.978
No, they're not gonna
pay 11.5 million.

22:59.012 --> 23:00.413
I could go back to them,
I could say,

23:00.447 --> 23:01.748
"Now he feels that
you're gonna pay more

23:01.781 --> 23:03.149
because you really want it."

23:03.183 --> 23:04.551
And they're gonna say,
"Go f*** yourself."

23:04.584 --> 23:06.052
And I'm gonna say,
"Thank you so much."

23:06.052 --> 23:07.153
I'm gonna come in here--

23:07.187 --> 23:09.589
All right, just be quiet
for a second, yeah?

23:09.622 --> 23:11.157
You really delivered here.

23:11.191 --> 23:13.226
Let's get it done.
11 million.

23:13.259 --> 23:16.596
Did he just swipe right
for Ryan?

23:16.629 --> 23:18.064
I think he did.

23:18.064 --> 23:19.065
For you.

23:19.065 --> 23:20.066
Thank you very much.

23:20.066 --> 23:21.968
$11 million,
and I got a bottle of wine.

23:22.068 --> 23:23.236
Just kidding.
I love it.

23:23.269 --> 23:25.071
Good job, Ryan.

23:30.877 --> 23:33.413
Ronnie, we are in contract
for 12-D.

23:33.446 --> 23:36.149
It turned out
that the owners of 12-D

23:36.182 --> 23:37.817
were already looking
to move downtown

23:37.851 --> 23:39.185
even before
I called them.

23:39.219 --> 23:41.788
The stars aligned.
It was meant to be.

23:41.821 --> 23:43.656
I'm happy.
[chuckles]

23:43.690 --> 23:47.160
$3 million--
boom, contract.

23:47.193 --> 23:49.529
Love it.

23:49.562 --> 23:51.631
I know, but we still
have one more left.

23:51.664 --> 23:53.466
[suspenseful music]

23:53.500 --> 23:56.202
12-E, F,
the guy is never in town.

23:56.236 --> 23:57.804
I don't even know
if we could track him down,

23:57.837 --> 23:59.572
yet alone get him to sell.

23:59.606 --> 24:00.840
I have asked the doorman.

24:00.874 --> 24:03.143
I've waited outside
for a light to turn on,

24:03.176 --> 24:04.411
and it doesn't.

24:04.444 --> 24:06.546
I can't find them.

24:06.579 --> 24:07.714
(Luis)
Without E and F,

24:07.747 --> 24:09.349
we don't have
a full-floor unit.

24:09.382 --> 24:10.850
Without E and F,

24:10.884 --> 24:14.254
we don't have an elevator
landing into the apartment.

24:14.287 --> 24:16.056
[exhales deeply]

24:16.056 --> 24:19.526
I must find the owners
of E and F...

24:19.559 --> 24:20.627
period.

24:24.264 --> 24:25.932
Has he rented the apartments?

24:25.965 --> 24:27.500
Let me check.

24:30.704 --> 24:32.539
I know that this guy
has lived in this building

24:32.572 --> 24:33.807
for a long time.

24:33.840 --> 24:35.642
I know that he also
travels a lot.

24:35.675 --> 24:38.178
If he has rented this apartment
to someone else,

24:38.211 --> 24:39.913
there is a way
to find out about it.

24:39.946 --> 24:41.181
Search E and F.

24:41.214 --> 24:43.083
The only thing that I've
ever found from this guy

24:43.083 --> 24:45.585
was a phone number
which I've called and called

24:45.618 --> 24:47.721
and left messages and messages,
and he hasn't responded to me.

24:47.754 --> 24:49.756
This guy has no
cell phone number records.

24:49.789 --> 24:51.825
He has no Facebook, no Twitter,
no Instagram.

24:51.858 --> 24:53.827
He probably doesn't even
have an email address.

24:53.860 --> 24:55.495
Yes, it was rented.

24:55.528 --> 24:56.896
Get me the name
of the broker,

24:56.930 --> 24:58.898
and I'll see if we can find
the direct contact information

24:58.932 --> 25:00.433
for E and F.

25:00.467 --> 25:01.434

25:01.468 --> 25:03.036
When was the last time
it was rented?

25:03.036 --> 25:04.337
Please tell me
it was yesterday.

- Absolutely.

25:34.100 --> 25:36.636
So I got an interesting
call this weekend

25:36.670 --> 25:38.471
from this guy Michael,
who I know socially...

25:38.505 --> 25:39.539
Okay.

25:39.572 --> 25:41.307
Who lives
at 230 Central Park South.

25:41.341 --> 25:42.676
Okay, nice.

25:42.709 --> 25:45.612
Ian Reisner owns a couple
of units on a high floor.

25:45.645 --> 25:47.080
- Sure.
- Michael is his neighbor,

25:47.080 --> 25:49.816
who owns one of the units and is
being approached by Luis...

25:49.849 --> 25:51.384
- Ortiz?
- Yes.

25:53.853 --> 25:56.523
To purchase his apartment for
what he thinks is a low number.

25:56.556 --> 26:00.026
Luis made an offer on behalf
of this guy Ian?

26:00.060 --> 26:02.295
Yes, Michael thinks that he can
get more money out of them,

26:02.328 --> 26:05.031
and he wants you
to represent him.

26:06.466 --> 26:08.601
He knew that I work with you.

26:08.635 --> 26:11.237
He knows you guys have worked
together in the past.

26:11.271 --> 26:13.073
Uh, I haven't seen
Luis, actually.

26:13.106 --> 26:14.374
I thought you were
best friends.

26:14.407 --> 26:15.875
Luis doesn't
pick up the phone.

26:15.909 --> 26:18.078
His ego is just like, bam!

26:19.946 --> 26:22.882
This is like a gift from God.

26:22.916 --> 26:24.918
It's a Monday.
Need to give you good news.

26:24.951 --> 26:26.252
And it's early
in the morning.

26:26.286 --> 26:27.587
Shoot me over
his contact information,

26:27.620 --> 26:29.456

get on top of it,

26:29.489 --> 26:31.291

what we can do.

on the actual water itself?

On one side of the boat,

27:22.676 --> 27:24.177

to see 290 West

the Manhattan skyline.

is 290 West.

28:15.462 --> 28:16.763
like, now because
it's a construction site,

28:16.796 --> 28:18.064
it's hard to understand it.

28:18.098 --> 28:19.699
But when it's done
and you see that, like,

28:19.733 --> 28:21.668
50-foot living room
and all that glass

28:21.701 --> 28:22.769
and the water--

28:22.802 --> 28:24.137
And look at this,
this terrace, 41x10.

28:24.170 --> 28:25.238
Oh, my God.

28:25.271 --> 28:26.773
Ten is really nice,

28:26.806 --> 28:28.141
'cause you could put a chair,
you have a long table--

28:28.174 --> 28:29.342
- That's incredible.
- Whoa.

28:29.376 --> 28:30.744
Look at the windows.
So we made these, like,

28:30.777 --> 28:33.480
really industrial style,
like old Tribeca.

28:33.513 --> 28:36.182
The kitchens are all open,
all glass.

28:36.216 --> 28:39.219
So you think
you have someone?

28:39.252 --> 28:40.887
15 million
for the top penthouse,

28:40.920 --> 28:43.289
the entire roof
with a swimming pool.

28:43.323 --> 28:45.291
You're laying here with a really
beautiful Swedish woman

28:45.325 --> 28:48.128
with long legs, and she is
looking out to the view.

28:48.161 --> 28:49.796
I heard you flew
from Mexico

28:49.829 --> 28:52.132
to buy new construction
in Manhattan.

28:52.165 --> 28:53.199
Yes.

28:53.233 --> 28:54.768
I think the penthouse
is good for you.

28:54.801 --> 28:57.137
Swimming pool,
22-foot ceilings,

28:57.170 --> 28:59.539
all glass.

28:59.572 --> 29:01.675
The irony of tonight
and being on the boat

29:01.708 --> 29:04.644
is that I can actually
keep buyers focused on 290 West,

29:04.678 --> 29:07.480
more than at the nasty
construction site itself.

29:07.514 --> 29:08.748
That's my husband,
by the way.

29:08.782 --> 29:10.183
He's talking to a pretty good
friend of mine, Lynn.

29:10.216 --> 29:12.686
Isn't she beautiful?

29:12.719 --> 29:14.020
Oh, you want introduced
to Lynn?

29:14.020 --> 29:16.022
- Yes, yes, yes.
- Yeah.

29:16.022 --> 29:18.191
I'm very protective of her.

29:18.224 --> 29:20.560
Lynn and I met through
friends a couple of years ago.

29:20.593 --> 29:22.062
When we met the first time,

29:22.095 --> 29:24.364
it was like
this amazing connection.

29:24.397 --> 29:27.500
We looked at each other,
and we're like, "Wow."

29:30.170 --> 29:31.938
I mean, you know,
if I was straight,

29:32.038 --> 29:33.440
I would probably marry her.

29:33.473 --> 29:36.943
But I'm not, so now
we're bestest of friends.

29:39.479 --> 29:41.514
Yeah, sure.
Sorry, guys.

29:41.548 --> 29:42.916
Lynn and I wanted to have

29:42.949 --> 29:44.651
a little bit of
quality time with you.

29:48.288 --> 29:50.357
What is it?
Why are we going outside?

29:50.390 --> 29:52.125
[gasps]
Oh, my God.

29:52.158 --> 29:53.493
Look at her.
Look at her.

29:53.526 --> 29:56.062
She's so mean,
and she's so powerful,

29:56.062 --> 29:57.931
and she's so beautiful.

29:57.964 --> 30:01.668
You know, as much as, like,
I came here with nothing,

30:01.701 --> 30:03.436
and I feel like--
What? What is it?

30:08.174 --> 30:10.010
We...

30:10.043 --> 30:11.911
have been talking.

30:14.014 --> 30:15.382
We think that...

30:18.218 --> 30:21.488
the three of us
should have a baby.

30:24.024 --> 30:25.125
You?

30:31.598 --> 30:33.900
Yes.

30:33.933 --> 30:37.904
You know a guy named Michael,
apartment...

30:37.937 --> 30:39.906
You son of a bitch.

30:44.310 --> 30:45.578
- Ryan!
- Ryan!

30:45.612 --> 30:47.113
- Ryan!
- Ryan, this way!

30:47.147 --> 30:48.281
Ryan, look over here!

30:48.314 --> 30:49.416
How do you feel right now?

30:49.449 --> 30:50.884
This is greatest night
of my entire life.

30:50.917 --> 30:53.153
I think if you gave
anyone an opportunity

30:53.186 --> 30:55.321
to fulfill
their childhood dream,

30:55.355 --> 30:58.358
whether it's being a fireman
or being an astronaut

30:58.391 --> 31:00.827
or being in a movie,
that person would do it,

31:00.860 --> 31:02.862
no matter what
their current career is.

31:02.896 --> 31:03.963
Greatest experience ever.

31:04.064 --> 31:07.400
I just feel so, so lucky

31:07.434 --> 31:09.602
that I can fulfill
a childhood dream.

31:09.636 --> 31:10.970
- Are you excited?
- Yeah.

31:11.071 --> 31:13.206
- Sorry.
- All right, let's do it.

31:19.713 --> 31:21.514
(Lynn)
We think that...

31:24.517 --> 31:28.455
the three of us
should have a baby.

31:28.488 --> 31:30.357
Are you saying

31:30.390 --> 31:33.426
that you want to make Milla
with us?

31:33.460 --> 31:35.228
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

31:37.931 --> 31:39.199
Lynn was here all along.

31:39.232 --> 31:42.602
We just didn't really
consider it.

31:44.537 --> 31:46.339
And you're not gonna
change your mind?

31:46.373 --> 31:47.907
I would never
change my mind.

31:47.941 --> 31:49.442
Are you willing to,
like, give your eggs

31:49.476 --> 31:50.643
and go through
all the testing

31:50.677 --> 31:52.112
and the injections
and the hormones

31:52.112 --> 31:54.647
and the whole thing
and, like, actually give us

31:54.681 --> 31:56.850
that loving little Milla?

31:56.883 --> 31:58.118
Yeah.

31:58.118 --> 31:59.252
Did you know this?

31:59.285 --> 32:01.354
Maybe I had an idea.

32:01.388 --> 32:03.390
Babe.
Can you believe it?

32:04.557 --> 32:06.292
You grow up as a man,

32:06.326 --> 32:08.695
and you--
you want to have a family.

32:08.728 --> 32:10.296
That's all I wanted.

32:10.330 --> 32:12.932
[laughing hysterically]

32:16.703 --> 32:19.472
Finally a yes.

32:19.506 --> 32:22.509
It's not only like
Lynn is saying yes to us,

32:22.542 --> 32:25.645
but it's like the universe
says yes to me in some way.

32:25.679 --> 32:27.213
This is what I wanted.

32:27.247 --> 32:29.082
Oh, my God,
I want to scream to the world.

32:29.115 --> 32:30.083
Do it.

32:30.116 --> 32:31.751
Milla!

32:31.785 --> 32:35.455
Oh, I love my little
dysfunctional family.

32:35.488 --> 32:36.956
[Lynn laughs]

32:36.990 --> 32:40.093
[upbeat music]

32:40.126 --> 32:42.495
* *

32:42.529 --> 32:43.997
[birds chirping]

32:44.097 --> 32:45.665
- Hello.
- Hi.

32:45.699 --> 32:47.367
- Michael. Pleased to meet you.
- Ryan. How are you?

32:47.400 --> 32:48.702
Hi, Ryan.

32:48.735 --> 32:51.104
Wow, you are undergoing
a renovation.

32:51.104 --> 32:52.839
That's right.

32:54.274 --> 32:56.876
Michael, the guy who
Ivy wanted me to talk to

32:56.910 --> 32:59.145
about the buyout
at Central Park South,

32:59.179 --> 33:02.115
is very, very anxious.

33:02.148 --> 33:04.451
I've been here
since about 2000.

33:04.484 --> 33:06.219
He just got back
into town last night,

33:06.252 --> 33:09.055
and he already reached out
to me to come by this morning.

33:09.089 --> 33:10.290
Do you live here
full-time?

33:10.323 --> 33:12.158
I do officially
live here full-time,

33:12.192 --> 33:15.195
but I spend about half the year
on a ranch in Brazil.

33:15.228 --> 33:16.696
- On a ranch in Brazil.
- Yes.

33:16.730 --> 33:18.898
- Big cattle ranch.
- Wow.

33:18.932 --> 33:20.934
So I know
the building well.

33:20.967 --> 33:23.136
I've never seen
this line before.

33:23.169 --> 33:24.804
This apartment's
actually a little bit bigger

33:24.838 --> 33:25.805
than the line...

33:25.839 --> 33:26.906
Okay.

33:26.940 --> 33:29.776
'Cause it's a combination
of two...

33:29.809 --> 33:32.445
Double the apartment...

33:32.479 --> 33:33.446
[pops lips]

33:33.480 --> 33:35.382
Double the money.

33:35.415 --> 33:36.916
Would you like
to look around?

33:36.950 --> 33:38.518
Yeah, let's do it.

33:38.551 --> 33:41.521
[upbeat music]

33:41.554 --> 33:44.924
Michael's lived in this place
for 15 years,

33:44.958 --> 33:46.693
and he does not want to move.

33:46.726 --> 33:48.995
He just embarked
on a renovation last year.

33:49.095 --> 33:55.168
* *

33:55.201 --> 33:56.536
Here's the thing.

33:56.569 --> 33:58.872
This has got a great
southern exposure

33:58.905 --> 34:00.173
with a lot of light.

34:00.206 --> 34:01.174
Yep.

34:01.207 --> 34:03.843
But an absolutely
monstrous building

34:03.877 --> 34:05.445
is being constructed.

34:06.646 --> 34:09.049
Probably some
80 feet or so.

34:09.082 --> 34:10.850
And then if
that weren't enough,

34:10.884 --> 34:12.652
there's a double whammy--

34:12.686 --> 34:14.554
a second one
right across the street.

34:14.587 --> 34:16.322
This is supposed to be

34:16.356 --> 34:19.325
actually the tallest
residential skyscraper

34:19.359 --> 34:20.727
in Midtown Manhattan.

34:20.760 --> 34:23.163
And it's coming up right in
front of your dining room.

34:23.196 --> 34:24.164
And the bedroom.

34:24.197 --> 34:26.066
- Welcome to New York.
- Yeah.

34:26.099 --> 34:29.302
A few weeks ago,
before Luis came along,

34:29.336 --> 34:32.472
Michael was basically
sh** out of luck.

34:32.505 --> 34:34.641
He'd spent hundreds
of thousands of dollars

34:34.674 --> 34:37.077
on this renovation
before realizing

34:37.110 --> 34:39.079
that these towers
were gonna come up

34:39.079 --> 34:42.482
and make his apartment
a cavernous hole.

34:42.515 --> 34:44.084
You are one
of the luckiest people

34:44.084 --> 34:45.985
that I've talked to
in a very long time.

34:46.086 --> 34:48.288
You are in one of the most
enviable situations

34:48.321 --> 34:49.789
that a homeowner
can be in,

34:49.823 --> 34:52.892
because the person that wants
to buy this apartment

34:52.926 --> 34:54.627
doesn't care
about your apartment.

34:54.661 --> 34:55.995
They just care
about the location.

34:56.096 --> 34:57.430
The space, right.

34:57.464 --> 34:59.199
They don't care that you don't
have views or light.

34:59.232 --> 35:01.034
It's Park-adjoining
square footage for him.

35:01.034 --> 35:02.202
Exactly.

35:02.235 --> 35:05.038
It's obvious
what's going on here.

35:05.071 --> 35:07.474
Luis and his developer
are trying to create

35:07.507 --> 35:10.210
one full-floor unit.

35:10.243 --> 35:14.114
But without Michael's
apartment, they can't do that.

35:14.147 --> 35:16.116
This apartment,

35:16.149 --> 35:18.852
fully renovated
the way you're doing it,

35:18.885 --> 35:20.520
without those buildings
coming up,

35:20.553 --> 35:23.923
I would be very, very happy
to get you, like, 2 1/2 million.

35:23.957 --> 35:26.526
But if you said,
"Ryan, sell this apartment

35:26.559 --> 35:27.761
for what you could
sell it for today..."

35:27.794 --> 35:29.062
Mm-hmm.

35:29.062 --> 35:30.964
I'd probably have to put
this apartment on the market

35:31.064 --> 35:34.501
for, let's say, 1.99 million.

35:34.534 --> 35:36.369
For them, because we know
how badly they want it...

35:36.403 --> 35:37.570
Right.

35:37.604 --> 35:42.208
I want them to overpay
by a million dollars.

35:42.242 --> 35:43.910
You know, in a way,

35:43.943 --> 35:48.214
I feel that I'm being
forced out of the apartment

35:48.248 --> 35:52.185
that I love to live in
with a crowbar,

35:52.218 --> 35:54.387
but if it's
a million-dollar crowbar...

35:54.421 --> 35:56.322
It's a million-dollar crowbar.

35:56.356 --> 35:57.824
Then I would sell.

35:57.857 --> 35:59.826
- That's an expensive crowbar.
- Million-dollar crowbar.

35:59.859 --> 36:01.027
- Let's do it.
- Okay.

36:01.027 --> 36:02.662
A million would be great,

36:02.696 --> 36:05.131
but I'm gonna swing
for the fences.

36:05.165 --> 36:09.869
Ah, the beauty of a buyout.

36:09.903 --> 36:12.339
Mmm, mmm.

36:12.372 --> 36:13.506
Thank you
for showing me around.

36:13.540 --> 36:14.574
- Sure. Absolutely.
- It's beautiful.

36:14.607 --> 36:16.042
Sucks you're gonna
have to leave.

36:16.042 --> 36:17.777
I'm gonna give Luis,
our friend, a call.

36:17.811 --> 36:20.780
[gentle music]

36:20.814 --> 36:23.283
* *

36:23.316 --> 36:26.419
[line trilling]

36:26.453 --> 36:27.454
- Ronita?
- Yeah?

36:27.487 --> 36:30.056
Can you come back
to the office?

36:33.059 --> 36:35.061
As soon as possible.

36:35.061 --> 36:38.164
[phone rings]
- Hello, this is Luis.

36:38.198 --> 36:40.533
Yes.

36:40.567 --> 36:44.371
I'm very well.
How are you?

36:44.404 --> 36:48.174
This is why I have
somebody answering my phones.

36:48.208 --> 36:50.877
Ronita, you are fired.

36:50.910 --> 36:51.911
Do you have
a moment?

36:51.945 --> 36:53.613
I do.

36:58.685 --> 37:02.389
I know you do a lot
on Central Park South.

37:07.027 --> 37:09.362
Ah, Luis, Luis, Luis.

37:09.396 --> 37:14.100
You are gonna be really glad
you answered the phone today.

37:16.670 --> 37:20.240
For instance, you know that
building 230 Central Park South?

37:24.044 --> 37:25.545
So I've got
this listing there.

37:25.578 --> 37:29.049
I literally
just signed it.

37:29.049 --> 37:31.384
You know a guy
named Michael, apartment...

37:35.221 --> 37:36.556
Are you there?
Did I lose you?

37:45.799 --> 37:47.901
Who's gonna pay
what I think...

37:50.637 --> 37:52.939
And I just wanted
to give you the call first...

37:55.608 --> 37:57.544
Have somebody for me.

37:57.577 --> 38:00.547
[suspenseful music]

38:00.580 --> 38:02.048
* *

38:02.082 --> 38:03.650
What are you doing, Ryan?

38:03.683 --> 38:05.185
What do you mean?

38:05.218 --> 38:06.419
I'm gonna price it...

38:06.453 --> 38:09.823
[clears throat]
You know, pretty competitively.

38:09.856 --> 38:12.592
It's 230 Central Park South...

38:12.625 --> 38:14.861
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I'm writing it down.

38:19.432 --> 38:22.302
Undergoing a renovation...

38:22.335 --> 38:24.371
and I'm asking
$10 million.

38:32.245 --> 38:34.347
As long as we could
contain the cost

38:34.381 --> 38:36.383
we pay for those
two units

38:36.416 --> 38:38.651
to something around
$6 million,

38:38.685 --> 38:40.453
I think we're
onto something.

38:40.487 --> 38:42.856
Is this a joke, Ryan?

38:42.889 --> 38:43.890
No.
No, no, no.

38:43.923 --> 38:45.058
Everyone says I'm crazy,

38:45.091 --> 38:47.460
'cause I like to price
really aggressively,

38:47.494 --> 38:50.063
and they might be right,
you know?

38:50.063 --> 38:51.431
[laughs]

38:55.201 --> 38:56.870
Seriously?

38:56.903 --> 38:59.239
Why don't you go, um...

38:59.272 --> 39:00.573
f*** yourself?

39:00.607 --> 39:03.276
Real estate is a sport,

39:03.309 --> 39:07.380
and I smell blood.

39:07.414 --> 39:08.682
Bring me somebody, baby!

39:08.715 --> 39:10.650
12-E, F.
I know you have somebody.

39:10.684 --> 39:12.052
Ten million bucks.

39:14.554 --> 39:15.622
I got stuff to do.

39:15.655 --> 39:18.158
You have a good day,
Mr. Luis D. Ortiz.

39:18.191 --> 39:19.793
[phone beeps]

39:19.826 --> 39:22.696
Oh, God, that felt
so good, Yuri.

39:22.729 --> 39:24.230
Ryan, are you there?

39:31.404 --> 39:33.506
You son of a bitch.

39:39.579 --> 39:41.815
Is this a joke?
Is this a joke?

39:45.585 --> 39:48.555
[upbeat music]

39:48.588 --> 39:50.724
* *

39:50.757 --> 39:52.926
[phone rings]

39:56.062 --> 39:58.064
I have two minutes
for a guy

39:58.098 --> 40:01.534
that's about to do
a record-setting deal with me.

40:01.568 --> 40:04.738
Unfortunately...

40:09.242 --> 40:11.344
Why? Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

40:18.752 --> 40:20.687
He was arrested
this morning?

40:23.556 --> 40:26.192
Like, real arrested?

40:26.226 --> 40:28.428
Or, like, Bieber arrested?

40:28.461 --> 40:30.130
Is this a joke?
Is this a joke?

40:36.536 --> 40:38.204
Was he arrested
for jaywalking?

40:38.238 --> 40:40.006
Or was he arrested--
Is he a serial killer?

40:40.040 --> 40:42.142
Like, what--

40:50.250 --> 40:54.054
Do you want to put it
on hold?

40:54.087 --> 40:55.755
[phone beeps]

40:55.789 --> 40:58.525
Did--did he just hang up
the phone?

40:59.793 --> 41:01.361
What the f***?

41:01.394 --> 41:04.164
Of all the things
that could kill a deal...

41:04.197 --> 41:05.365
jail?

41:05.398 --> 41:07.267
Yuri, can you just drive
in circles?

41:07.300 --> 41:08.635
'Cause I have to make a--

41:08.668 --> 41:10.370
I have to make
the worst phone call of my life.

41:10.403 --> 41:11.805
Please.

41:11.838 --> 41:14.074
[line trilling]

41:16.676 --> 41:19.412
Pretty good, sort of.

41:22.182 --> 41:24.951
No, we were supposed
to have it today,

41:24.984 --> 41:27.821
but the broker
just called me

41:27.854 --> 41:31.958
and said that his client
was arrested this morning

41:31.991 --> 41:35.962
and that the deal is off.

41:41.735 --> 41:43.203
I--

41:43.236 --> 41:44.671
I-I know,
and that's what I said.

41:44.704 --> 41:46.339
But I don't think
there's anything I can do,

41:46.373 --> 41:49.242
short of going down to, like,
the jailhouse.

41:54.647 --> 41:58.018
I--

41:58.118 --> 41:59.819
I had no--

42:02.756 --> 42:04.157
[suspenseful music]

42:04.190 --> 42:06.393
This has nothing to do with
my capabilities as a broker.

42:06.426 --> 42:08.528
It has everything to do with--

42:08.561 --> 42:11.498
[phone beeps]

42:11.531 --> 42:15.301
This is unbelievable.

42:15.335 --> 42:18.705
Over $300,000, just gone.

42:18.738 --> 42:20.707
[sighs]
Motherf***er!

42:20.740 --> 42:23.443
Oh, Jesus!

42:23.476 --> 42:25.412
F***!

Next on the season finale

42:26.913 --> 42:28.882
of<i>Million Dollar Listing</i>
<i>New York...</i>

42:28.915 --> 42:32.919
We have reached 50% sold
at 290 West.

42:32.952 --> 42:33.953
50%!

42:33.987 --> 42:35.422
That pays the bank back.

42:35.455 --> 42:37.891
I mean, come on, I sold half the
building in just a few weeks.

42:37.924 --> 42:39.392
Whee!

42:39.426 --> 42:40.627
$4 million is ridiculous.

42:40.660 --> 42:43.096
That destroys
the whole mission.

42:43.096 --> 42:45.298
To get him to move,
the bottom line

42:45.331 --> 42:48.301
that he has given me
is $5 million.

42:48.335 --> 42:49.402
You are full of sh**.

42:49.436 --> 42:51.004
Ricky, I want those units.

42:51.104 --> 42:53.506
How can I even give you
a real number

42:53.540 --> 42:56.910
when you're in f***ing
planet Jupiter?

42:56.943 --> 42:59.479
Let me warn you, failure in
this situation is not an option.

42:59.512 --> 43:00.947
Just sit down
for one second.

43:01.047 --> 43:03.316
Don't touch me, bro.
