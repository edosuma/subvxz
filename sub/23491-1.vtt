00:52.461 --> 00:54.730
Can't believe we brought them,
Marisa.

00:54.732 --> 00:55.764
This is crazy stuff.

00:55.766 --> 00:57.434
Can you guys just trust me?

00:57.436 --> 00:58.868
I've been planning
this all year.

00:58.870 --> 01:01.272
Why are you laughing?
It's not funny.

01:01.274 --> 01:04.308
Okay, you're not cute.
You're disgusting.

01:04.310 --> 01:06.211
Guys, let's never be like that.
No.

01:06.213 --> 01:08.947
Let's just be us.
We're so cool as we are.

01:08.949 --> 01:10.416
I love me.

01:10.418 --> 01:13.019
Man, last year, when
the senior girls caught freshmen

01:13.021 --> 01:14.588
they made them
deep-throat bananas.

01:14.590 --> 01:15.789
What?
Like, unpeeled?

01:15.791 --> 01:17.792
Yes, unpeeled bananas.
Down their throat,

01:17.794 --> 01:19.728
scraping those throats.
Ugh!

01:19.730 --> 01:20.595
It's so deep.

01:20.597 --> 01:22.131
I could do, like, peeled though.

01:22.133 --> 01:24.500
That would... that would,
like, be sexy.

01:24.502 --> 01:26.436
Like, mushy.

01:26.438 --> 01:27.571
Sexy? No, no.

01:27.573 --> 01:28.438
I don't know.

01:28.440 --> 01:30.441
Dude, I can't believe
we're doing this.

01:30.443 --> 01:31.609
We're like the three Amigos.

01:31.611 --> 01:33.344
We're like Charlie's Angels
or TLC.

01:33.346 --> 01:35.914
Oh, my god. Dude, I always
wanted to be left eye.

01:35.916 --> 01:37.483
I love that you said that.

01:37.485 --> 01:38.517
Rest in peace, my nigga.

01:38.519 --> 01:39.719
Ninja warrior for life.

01:39.721 --> 01:42.222
No, she can say it.
I said it. I can.

01:42.224 --> 01:43.991
Let's send these
bitches off right.

01:43.993 --> 01:45.693
God, I'm tired of their shit.

01:45.695 --> 01:46.727
Let's do this.
No. What?

01:46.729 --> 01:49.531
No, no, no.
They're gonna destroy us.

01:49.533 --> 01:50.932
No, when they caught
the freshmen,

01:50.934 --> 01:53.469
the entire year,
they did this to them:

01:54.938 --> 01:56.473
Is that a blow job?

01:56.475 --> 01:57.775
Yes, blow job.
They do that.

01:57.777 --> 02:01.212
Right. For sure. That's so
humiliating for that to be...

02:01.214 --> 02:02.213
Oh, god.

02:02.215 --> 02:03.783
We're gonna be fine.
Stick to the plan.

02:03.785 --> 02:06.352
We're gonna stay low,
hide behind parked cars.

02:06.354 --> 02:07.620
Keep up the pace.
Okay, Annie?

02:07.622 --> 02:10.723
I have to fart, but I feel
like I might shit myself.

02:10.726 --> 02:12.360
Hold it in.
I'm gonna hold it in.

02:12.362 --> 02:14.762
You don't wanna ruin that
with a poop stain.

02:14.764 --> 02:16.932
You keep that in there.
I'll try.

02:17.968 --> 02:19.268
Well, well, well.

02:19.270 --> 02:21.237
What do we have here?

02:21.239 --> 02:23.440
I think we just
found this year's

02:23.442 --> 02:26.711
banana-blow-job
bitches, bitches.

02:26.713 --> 02:27.712
Are you ready, bitches?

02:27.714 --> 02:30.782
I've asked you so many times
not to do that.

02:32.453 --> 02:35.855
Hey, Sarah.
I'm Marisa.

02:36.090 --> 02:36.989
For sure.

02:36.991 --> 02:39.626
Uh, I know we just met, but I...
I have a question.

02:39.628 --> 02:44.099
Before or after this is halfway
down your throat?

02:44.266 --> 02:46.602
I'm gonna ask before.

02:47.037 --> 02:47.937
Okay.

02:47.939 --> 02:49.004
Um, congratulations.

02:49.006 --> 02:51.875
You guys obviously
got into unis, but...

02:51.877 --> 02:52.676
Bitches.

02:52.678 --> 02:53.810
But what's up with state?

02:53.812 --> 02:57.048
Did you aim high
and fall a little short?

02:57.050 --> 02:58.183
Or was that the plan?

02:58.185 --> 03:00.386
Of course I wanted to go.
My parents went to state.

03:00.388 --> 03:03.156
Their parents went to state,
and their parents went.

03:03.158 --> 03:05.091
It's really well-known.

03:05.093 --> 03:06.494
Yeah, I'm a legacy there.

03:06.496 --> 03:09.130
No, yeah, totally.
God, I'm... I'm sorry.

03:09.132 --> 03:11.633
I didn't mean to, like,
offend you.

03:11.635 --> 03:14.469
Banana blow job, bitches.

03:14.471 --> 03:15.838
I really don't
wanna blow a banana.

03:15.840 --> 03:19.610
I have, like, three months'
worth of Adderall, ha, ha.

03:19.612 --> 03:22.579
Would you want that?

03:23.949 --> 03:24.649
Okay.

03:24.651 --> 03:28.654
Okay, well, you're gonna have
to catch it first, bitch.

03:29.055 --> 03:30.623
Fuck you, hos!

03:33.262 --> 03:35.730
Oh, my god!

03:38.334 --> 03:39.667
Oh, my god. Annie!

03:39.669 --> 03:41.503
It wasn't even Adderall,
you guys.

03:41.505 --> 03:42.805
It was fucking ibuprofen.

03:42.807 --> 03:44.941
Oh, my god!
I can't breathe.

03:44.943 --> 03:45.875
I can't breathe.

03:45.877 --> 03:47.377
You got this, girl.
You got this.

03:47.379 --> 03:49.980
It's gonna be okay.
Oh, that was so cool!

03:49.982 --> 03:50.881
That was so fucking cool.

03:50.883 --> 03:52.684
It was invigorating.
That was so cool.

03:52.686 --> 03:55.253
I cannot believe we did that.
Fuck, yes.

03:55.255 --> 03:57.757
We are such cool best friends.

03:57.759 --> 04:00.226
What? Let's always
be this way.

04:00.228 --> 04:03.397
Let's always be this cool
and this there for each other.

04:03.399 --> 04:04.531
Oh, my god.
Yes.

04:04.533 --> 04:06.701
Dude, in our senior year,
we're not gonna do

04:06.703 --> 04:08.203
any of that bullshit
either, okay?

04:08.205 --> 04:11.240
And I think we should open
our college acceptance letters

04:11.242 --> 04:13.910
together at the end
of that stupid party.

04:14.947 --> 04:16.046
Really?
Yes.

04:16.048 --> 04:17.748
That's a great idea.
That's amazing.

04:17.750 --> 04:20.184
It'd be so meaningful.
It's dope, I like it.

04:20.185 --> 04:22.888
Right? Aw.
Yeah.

04:23.056 --> 04:24.590
You know what it's time for?

04:24.592 --> 04:26.025
I know what you're gonna say.

04:26.027 --> 04:27.927
You're gonna say, like,
"a group hug"?

04:27.929 --> 04:29.162
It's time for a group hug.

04:29.164 --> 04:30.664
Is it group hug time, Annie?

04:30.666 --> 04:31.732
Group hug.

04:31.734 --> 04:34.034
Get in here.
I love you guys.

06:53.376 --> 06:54.275
Grandma, is this new?

06:54.277 --> 06:57.446
Yes, indeed-y.
And it is fire.

06:57.448 --> 06:59.581
Went to the pharmacy Friday.

06:59.583 --> 07:01.084
Okay.

07:01.086 --> 07:03.420
This one is yours.

07:03.422 --> 07:05.656
Thank you, baby doll.

07:05.658 --> 07:08.359
You gonna open that, sweetie?

07:08.361 --> 07:09.327
No.

07:09.329 --> 07:10.629
All right, stay bad, gram.

07:10.631 --> 07:15.401
Just promise me you'll wait to
smoke that until after school.

07:15.403 --> 07:17.838
I promise.

07:17.840 --> 07:20.140
She gonna smoke it.

07:22.079 --> 07:25.915
Pretty sure your hands are
supposed to be under your butt.

07:28.352 --> 07:29.351
Hey, where's your letter?

07:29.353 --> 07:32.355
I've got a letter v right here.

07:32.357 --> 07:33.423
No, your college letter.

07:33.425 --> 07:35.860
Okay, Annie,
I really don't wanna deal

07:35.862 --> 07:36.828
with the bullshit today.

07:36.830 --> 07:38.931
Like, I'm just trying to chill.

07:38.933 --> 07:40.399
I'm sorry.

07:42.837 --> 07:43.336
Oh.

07:43.338 --> 07:46.072
Yes, please,
give me a hit of that.

07:46.074 --> 07:47.775
What, you woke up with asthma?

07:47.777 --> 07:51.880
I'm pretty sure I did.
I've been just so out of whack.

07:53.517 --> 07:55.752
Why are you doing Kegels?

07:58.789 --> 08:01.091
Do you just know
if you have a tight vagina?

08:01.093 --> 08:04.028
Yeah, it just, like, depends,
I guess, on the day.

08:04.030 --> 08:06.264
I know that, like,
your vagina, like, looks

08:06.266 --> 08:08.534
really messed up
after you have kids,

08:08.536 --> 08:09.835
along with your butthole, so...

08:09.837 --> 08:11.638
How does your butthole
look different?

08:11.640 --> 08:14.741
Sometimes it just rips
and becomes one giant hole.

08:15.879 --> 08:18.146
I'm serious.

08:19.381 --> 08:21.216
I do my Kegels in silence.

08:21.218 --> 08:22.785
You don't have to do that.
You don't.

08:22.787 --> 08:24.521
You can sit
and do it in silence.

08:24.523 --> 08:25.855
You can do it in class.

08:25.857 --> 08:27.590
You look like you're gonna shit.

08:27.592 --> 08:31.495
I am. I'm peeking a little bit.
I do have to poop.

08:33.500 --> 08:34.166
God.

08:34.168 --> 08:37.102
Kelly waited. We're gonna open
our envelopes together.

08:37.105 --> 08:40.840
She waited. It's gonna be
the best moment of our lives.

08:40.842 --> 08:41.842
Annie, okay, look.

08:41.844 --> 08:43.610
I'm gonna give you
until 10 a.m.

08:43.611 --> 08:46.114
To get your shit together
and get this out of your system.

08:46.116 --> 08:48.650
The bitch hasn't talked to you
in two years.

08:48.652 --> 08:52.354
We're not friends. I just...
I don't... I don't have time.

08:52.356 --> 08:54.558
So when you're ready,

08:54.725 --> 08:56.393
you let me know.

08:56.395 --> 08:59.397
Okay. Love you.

09:02.202 --> 09:03.769
Sorry I'm late,
Ms. Walker.

09:03.771 --> 09:05.504
I'm never late,
especially on my period.

09:05.506 --> 09:07.507
I have a uterus
like a wristwatch.

09:07.509 --> 09:08.441
Funny you say that.

09:08.443 --> 09:09.776
I've been told I have a uterus

09:09.778 --> 09:11.879
the shape of a baseball glove
clenching an acorn.

09:11.881 --> 09:15.283
Anyway, how's that application
to Cornell coming?

09:15.285 --> 09:18.119
Well, my parents love it,
but they love everything I do.

09:18.121 --> 09:19.388
I'm gonna stop you right there.

09:19.390 --> 09:22.592
Um, when are you gonna
cut the bullshit?

09:23.094 --> 09:24.828
Sorry?
The bullshit, honey.

09:24.830 --> 09:28.333
I'm a college counselor, okay?
A teacher of tomorrow?

09:28.335 --> 09:29.500
Oh, that's intense.

09:29.502 --> 09:32.538
You bet your puffy, little
nipples it's intense, okay?

09:32.540 --> 09:34.940
Puffy, that is totally
what they are.

09:34.942 --> 09:36.309
I have your file right here.

09:36.311 --> 09:38.144
Know what's in there?
Phenomenal GPA.

09:38.146 --> 09:41.015
Test scores through the roof.
You're a concert-level cellist.

09:41.017 --> 09:43.517
And, yet, what did you write
your personal statement about?

09:43.519 --> 09:46.221
On a pledge that me, Marisa,
and Kelly made freshman year.

09:46.223 --> 09:49.192
Oh, right. That hair brained
banana-blow-job pact.

09:49.194 --> 09:51.227
"Look at us.
We made a pact

09:51.229 --> 09:53.397
to open our
college letters together.

09:53.399 --> 09:54.498
What's gonna happen?
Oh, boy.

09:54.500 --> 09:56.334
Even though we got
the letters months ago,

09:56.336 --> 09:58.904
and our poor parents
need to put deposits down

09:58.906 --> 10:00.005
to hold our spots."

10:00.007 --> 10:01.707
It's selfish.

10:01.709 --> 10:03.276
It's a personal statement.

10:03.278 --> 10:06.713
Personal, okay? You wrote about
two other people.

10:06.715 --> 10:08.115
It's important to me.

10:08.117 --> 10:10.585
It's ridiculous.

10:10.587 --> 10:12.086
You should be ashamed.

10:35.750 --> 10:38.219
Congratulations!
Oh, my god.

10:38.221 --> 10:40.722
Wow, that's a lot of balloons,
mom. Thank you.

10:40.724 --> 10:42.325
I know. I know.
Nobody is surprised.

10:42.327 --> 10:45.428
Your dad is making pancakes with
little Stanford S's on them.

10:45.430 --> 10:47.297
He's hungry
after the night we had.

10:47.299 --> 10:49.232
Oh, my god.
That's a good one.

10:49.234 --> 10:50.568
Right?
That's a good one, mom.

10:50.570 --> 10:52.203
You don't have to
give me a high-five.

10:52.205 --> 10:54.238
I'm gonna...
No. Oh, okay.

10:54.240 --> 10:55.674
Why don't we have

10:55.676 --> 10:58.744
your first breakfast
as a Stanford girl?

10:58.746 --> 11:00.480
Oh, don't cry.
"Stanford girl"?

11:00.482 --> 11:01.781
Really,
we're gonna call me that?

11:01.783 --> 11:03.884
We're gonna call you
"Stanford girl."

11:03.886 --> 11:04.685
Don't cry. You can't

11:04.687 --> 11:06.253
I don't wanna call you
your first name.

11:06.255 --> 11:08.223
I wanna call you "Stanford
girl," oh, my goodness.

11:08.225 --> 11:11.193
- I love you so much. I can't...
- I love you too.

11:25.713 --> 11:27.513
Congratulations, seniors.

11:27.515 --> 11:29.449
We've made it through
another school year.

11:29.451 --> 11:32.152
Just remember that
today is your last day

11:32.154 --> 11:34.956
to put your pictures up
on the college board map.

11:34.958 --> 11:37.559
That's where we can see
where you're all going,

11:37.561 --> 11:38.927
so we can all stay in touch.

11:38.929 --> 11:42.065
On behalf of the entire
faculty, I just wanna say

11:42.067 --> 11:45.369
how proud and honored I am
to have taught all of you,

11:45.371 --> 11:51.410
and see you blossom into
the adults that I know you are.

11:51.978 --> 11:54.647
I wanna get your pussy filled.

11:54.649 --> 11:55.748
Okay.
Yeah.

11:55.750 --> 11:57.951
You have so many
questions about sex.

11:57.953 --> 11:59.253
We should get you some answers.

11:59.255 --> 12:02.791
So?
Phil. Philly Cheesesteak!

12:04.226 --> 12:05.795
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:05.797 --> 12:06.962
Legland.
Hey.

12:06.964 --> 12:08.030
What's good with you girls?

12:08.032 --> 12:09.432
Hey.
Y'all chilling?

12:09.434 --> 12:12.369
Chill... yeah. Just hanging out
and talking, you know?

12:12.371 --> 12:13.703
I feel you.
I feel you.

12:13.705 --> 12:16.007
Yo, y'all hip
to this new thug tape?

12:16.009 --> 12:16.941
Yo, gangster shit.

12:16.943 --> 12:20.212
Doesn't come out for a minute.
I got it two weeks early.

12:20.214 --> 12:22.014
So you're, like,
ahead of the curve.

12:22.016 --> 12:23.850
I mean, it's like, you know,

12:23.852 --> 12:25.585
a culture, gangster shit.

12:25.587 --> 12:27.955
You're on the pulse.

12:27.957 --> 12:29.156
I'm sorry, what?

12:29.158 --> 12:31.393
Like you know what's up
before it's up.

12:31.395 --> 12:32.527
Yeah, I guess.

12:32.529 --> 12:33.829
Yeah, you can call me hip.

12:33.831 --> 12:36.099
Got it.
Yeah, that's exactly it.

12:36.101 --> 12:36.999
One hundred, one hundred.

12:37.001 --> 12:39.470
Right, yeah. I dig.
Good for you.

12:39.472 --> 12:43.006
We're just trying to figure out
where the party is tonight.

12:43.008 --> 12:44.943
Oh, yeah, me too.
I asked some dude.

12:44.945 --> 12:46.678
He just called me a boner.

12:46.680 --> 12:47.479
I'm sorry.

12:47.481 --> 12:48.814
No, I'm not...
I'm not mad at him.

12:48.816 --> 12:52.586
Not tripping.
I laugh at bullies, you know?

12:55.290 --> 12:58.025
That's so cool.

12:58.560 --> 13:02.598
Annie's status is "sometimes
my feet smell and my nose runs.

13:02.600 --> 13:05.268
Does that mean
I was built upside down?"

13:05.270 --> 13:06.803
Ugh. Sometimes
she's so stupid,

13:06.805 --> 13:08.304
I think we should
worry about her,

13:08.306 --> 13:09.773
but then I'm like, "nah."

13:09.775 --> 13:12.644
That is so stupid.
It doesn't even make sense.

13:12.646 --> 13:14.279
Like, I don't even get it.

13:14.281 --> 13:15.413
Kelly, I cannot believe

13:15.415 --> 13:17.483
you used to be friends
with those girls.

13:17.485 --> 13:18.851
Yeah, it was a while ago.

13:18.853 --> 13:21.421
You're so much better than them.

13:21.423 --> 13:22.523
I mean, look at them.

13:22.525 --> 13:26.094
They're so ugly
and kind of dusty-looking.

13:26.096 --> 13:28.229
Seriously, Kelly,
how have you not told anyone

13:28.231 --> 13:29.798
where you're going to college?

13:29.800 --> 13:31.901
People are, like,
getting pissed.

13:31.903 --> 13:33.770
You girls gonna be around
this summer?

13:33.772 --> 13:35.338
Yes. Yeah.
Both of us will be.

13:35.340 --> 13:37.607
I will be. She will be.
Both of us.

13:37.609 --> 13:38.876
I'm... I'm
chilling too.

13:38.878 --> 13:42.414
I'd love to hang...
Hang out, if you guys are down.

13:42.416 --> 13:44.183
Sweet. I wanna hang.

13:44.185 --> 13:45.551
I love food.
Me too.

13:45.553 --> 13:48.154
- Sweet, sounds awesome.
- Definitely.

13:48.156 --> 13:50.791
Great. Cool.
Great.

13:50.793 --> 13:52.960
I'm, uh,
I'm gonna roll out, guys.

13:52.962 --> 13:54.061
Sweet.
Awesome.

13:54.063 --> 13:57.098
Good talking to you.
Likewise. Okay.

13:58.035 --> 13:59.268
I'm sorry.
I went for another one.

13:59.270 --> 14:01.571
She is so fucking gangster.
I can't even.

14:01.573 --> 14:04.007
Later.

14:04.009 --> 14:05.275
Annie, dude!

14:05.277 --> 14:07.478
He's got fucking skinny legs.

14:07.480 --> 14:10.181
You know what they say about
guys with skinny legs.

14:10.183 --> 14:12.484
What do they say?
Big old dicks.

14:12.486 --> 14:13.819
Really?
Yeah.

14:13.821 --> 14:16.957
Do you think he has a big dick?
I don't know, man.

14:16.959 --> 14:20.528
I wonder if it has
lots of veins in it.

14:20.530 --> 14:21.495
Dicks have veins?

14:21.497 --> 14:25.634
You haven't applied to
a single college, Marisa.

14:25.636 --> 14:26.368
Yeah.

14:26.370 --> 14:28.504
You literally think you're
too cool for school,

14:28.506 --> 14:30.073
what, 'cause
your parents got divorced?

14:30.075 --> 14:31.341
Everyone's parents get divorced.

14:31.343 --> 14:34.378
We all know you went to go live
with your mom for two years.

14:34.380 --> 14:36.848
Okay, you're back now,
and you're mine.

14:36.850 --> 14:39.184
You wanna know
what I did in high school?

14:39.186 --> 14:40.218
Yes. Please.
Tell me.

14:40.220 --> 14:43.189
I gained 60 pounds in 12 days.

14:43.191 --> 14:44.090
What?

14:44.092 --> 14:45.392
Okay, the doctors were stunned.

14:45.394 --> 14:48.161
I was on the evening news,
which was kind of great.

14:48.163 --> 14:50.598
Listen, you have
to go to college, okay?

14:50.600 --> 14:51.966
You don't have any skills.

14:51.968 --> 14:53.702
Okay. Thanks.

14:53.704 --> 14:56.805
Let me guess, you're gonna start
going by the name "tangerine"?

14:56.807 --> 15:00.744
Start writing,
like, a feminist blog?

15:00.978 --> 15:02.346
Get out of my... go!

15:02.348 --> 15:03.981
Get out of my office.
What...?

15:03.983 --> 15:04.782
Get out!

15:04.784 --> 15:07.185
Really?
No, don't actually go.

15:07.187 --> 15:08.820
Just stay but listen.

15:08.822 --> 15:10.490
Keep your panties on, tangerine.

15:10.492 --> 15:14.495
We've got a couple
of lessons to learn.

15:14.497 --> 15:17.531
Marisa, could I get
a lorazepam, or an ativan,

15:17.533 --> 15:18.933
or even, like, a Tylenol pm?

15:18.935 --> 15:20.035
I just feel really nervous.

15:20.037 --> 15:23.406
I wanna, but, uh, after I
gave something to that freshman,

15:23.408 --> 15:24.540
his mom put him in rehab.

15:24.542 --> 15:26.142
Thinks he's a drug addict.

15:26.144 --> 15:27.477
You kind of did him a favor,

15:27.479 --> 15:29.012
though, 'cause rehab's cool now.

15:29.014 --> 15:30.380
I mean, I wanna go to rehab.

15:30.382 --> 15:32.784
It would give me street cred.

15:32.786 --> 15:33.584
What would you go for?

15:33.586 --> 15:36.121
Not alcohol. That's fucked up.
Drugs.

15:36.123 --> 15:37.790
Here's my star.
There she is.

15:37.792 --> 15:41.995
So which university's orchestra
is the lucky winner?

15:41.997 --> 15:44.165
We're dying to know.
Do we know?

15:44.167 --> 15:46.334
Hey, Mr. Warner.
No, we don't know yet.

15:46.336 --> 15:48.537
Because me, Marisa,
and Kelly are waiting

15:48.539 --> 15:50.005
for a special moment
to open our letters.

15:50.007 --> 15:52.108
Um, we decided freshman year
after I almost had to

15:52.110 --> 15:54.377
suck off a banana that
we'd all do it together.

15:54.379 --> 15:55.611
It's a big thing.

15:55.613 --> 15:57.147
But that was before Kelly was

15:57.149 --> 15:58.982
Xena: cunt warrior Princess
though.

15:58.984 --> 16:00.385
Okay.

16:00.387 --> 16:01.753
Let's not...
Stupid bitch.

16:01.755 --> 16:04.357
Well, let's not go...
Jeez, you know?

16:04.359 --> 16:08.462
So where are you girls
going to college?

16:08.464 --> 16:11.164
You've got such vast skills.

16:11.166 --> 16:13.468
Mr. Warner,
do you happen to know

16:13.470 --> 16:14.902
where the party is tonight?

16:14.904 --> 16:17.373
Well, I'm afraid
I can't help you there.

16:17.375 --> 16:20.877
But I have been listening
to some of the kids.

16:20.879 --> 16:24.047
And I did hear, um,
"don't forget to vote."

16:24.049 --> 16:25.883
So not really
sure what that means.

16:25.885 --> 16:27.385
Wow, okay.
Thank you.

16:27.387 --> 16:29.421
I do remember this night
well though.

16:29.423 --> 16:31.189
What you're doing
is you're wondering:

16:31.191 --> 16:34.527
"Is Rebecca Franklin still gonna
want to make out with you

16:34.529 --> 16:36.462
despite the fact
that you puked on her arm

16:36.464 --> 16:39.933
and you scraped up your knee
on the concrete pretty good.

16:39.935 --> 16:41.602
But, no, no, she's off.

16:41.604 --> 16:44.105
She's chasing Trent Richland

16:44.107 --> 16:47.877
with the rest of the girls
and the boys."

16:47.879 --> 16:49.545
Who's Trent Richland?

16:58.726 --> 17:01.093
This is fucking ridiculous.

17:01.095 --> 17:01.860
Stupid kids.

17:01.862 --> 17:03.730
How'd they even get your
phone number?

17:03.732 --> 17:05.531
From Facebook.

17:05.534 --> 17:07.001
I put it up on Facebook.

17:07.002 --> 17:09.303
Big mistake.

17:09.838 --> 17:11.772
This is officer Richland.

17:12.443 --> 17:13.842
Very funny, you little turd.

17:13.844 --> 17:16.112
I can find you.
I can trace the...

17:16.114 --> 17:18.347
Don't give them
the satisfaction, Trent.

17:18.348 --> 17:20.917
I should've shaved.
Fucking went undercover.

17:20.920 --> 17:21.852
Yeah, that would've helped.

17:21.854 --> 17:24.021
These little shits.
Look at them all.

17:24.723 --> 17:26.257
Oh, yep. Yep.
Sorry. Sorry.

17:26.259 --> 17:29.462
Keep walking. Keep walking!
Sorry.

17:29.464 --> 17:32.032
Idiots. I'm gonna fuck
these kids up tonight.

17:32.034 --> 17:32.866
I hope not.

17:32.868 --> 17:34.401
I'm gonna fuck them up tonight.

17:34.403 --> 17:35.435
I really hope you don't.

17:35.437 --> 17:37.572
When you whisper,
it sounds more menacing.

17:37.574 --> 17:39.173
Do me a favor, and stand down.

17:39.175 --> 17:42.511
They're kids having fun at
the end of the year. You know?

17:42.513 --> 17:44.313
You can turn
a blind eye to a party...

17:44.315 --> 17:47.283
"Turn a blind eye," Joe Paterno?
See where that led him?

17:47.285 --> 17:49.053
You see what happened to him?
You idiot.

17:49.055 --> 17:51.889
You're the kind of guy
that thinks Jared from subway

17:51.891 --> 17:53.959
actually just loves
submarine sandwiches.

17:53.961 --> 17:57.663
No, he loved fucking
little boys, okay?

17:57.665 --> 17:59.665
There's something going on, pal.

17:59.667 --> 18:01.468
So keep your
fucking eyes peeled.

18:01.470 --> 18:04.104
Because this party could be
anywhere and nowhere

18:04.106 --> 18:05.172
at the same time.

18:05.174 --> 18:08.042
Why don't we just let
these kids have their moment?

18:09.847 --> 18:12.348
This is my moment.

18:12.350 --> 18:14.117
Okay?

18:15.787 --> 18:19.290
It smells like asparagus.
Kid, did you piss yourself?

18:19.292 --> 18:20.224
I'm sorry.

18:20.226 --> 18:21.459
We can't keep holding this kid

18:21.461 --> 18:24.029
for texting and walking,
which isn't a crime.

18:24.031 --> 18:25.297
His parents could sue us.

18:25.299 --> 18:27.333
They could sue us.
Your parents gonna sue me?

18:27.335 --> 18:29.669
Oh, t-they won't sue.
They're dentists.

18:29.671 --> 18:31.338
They just...
Just let me go.

18:31.340 --> 18:33.240
They're dentists, huh?
Yeah.

18:33.242 --> 18:34.208
That's a good thing.

18:34.210 --> 18:35.844
They're gonna have
to fix your teeth

18:35.846 --> 18:37.412
when I blow them out
of your head.

18:37.414 --> 18:38.613
Oh, shit.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:38.615 --> 18:41.250
Let me show you something.
Know what this is?

18:41.252 --> 18:42.018
It's a handgun.

18:42.020 --> 18:43.654
Put a fucking hole
in your chest.

18:43.656 --> 18:46.757
Not on purpose.
Where is the party?

18:46.759 --> 18:48.026
Seems like...
Where's the party?

18:48.028 --> 18:49.193
...unnecessary intimidation.

18:49.195 --> 18:51.530
I'm gonna be honest.
I'm gonna be upfront.

18:51.532 --> 18:52.898
I'm, like, usually the last guy

18:52.900 --> 18:55.000
to hear about
this sort of thing.

18:55.002 --> 18:57.370
Uh, like,
I probably wouldn't even go

18:57.372 --> 18:58.471
if I knew where it was.

18:58.473 --> 19:00.741
You know, parties,
they're kind of intimidating.

19:00.743 --> 19:02.677
They scare me.
You're intimidating.

19:02.679 --> 19:04.446
I see through
this kid's bullshit.

19:04.448 --> 19:06.615
He doesn't... yeah?
He's a liar, okay?

19:06.617 --> 19:09.419
He may be a dork
and a skinny, little pussy

19:09.421 --> 19:10.553
who never gets his dick wet,

19:10.555 --> 19:14.191
but I know he knows
where the party is.

19:14.193 --> 19:15.859
You know where it is, don't you?

19:15.861 --> 19:17.796
You're withholding
information from officers.

19:17.798 --> 19:19.598
Know what that is?
A fucking felony.

19:19.600 --> 19:21.767
Not in this case. It isn't.
It's a felony.

19:21.769 --> 19:24.570
Know where you'll end up?
I'm gonna go to jail.

19:24.572 --> 19:26.573
"I'm gonna go to jail."

19:26.575 --> 19:29.043
Not jail, prison.
You're not a little bitch.

19:29.045 --> 19:30.745
They're gonna eat you alive.
They're not.

19:30.747 --> 19:33.148
They're gonna eat your lunch
and your asshole.

19:33.150 --> 19:34.450
Oh, god.
That's what they do.

19:34.452 --> 19:36.785
I think that we should
let him be a student.

19:36.787 --> 19:39.356
We're gonna get you out
in just one second.

19:39.358 --> 19:40.423
Hey, hey, hey.

19:40.425 --> 19:42.560
Look, a group of fives there.
Sounds disrespectful.

19:42.562 --> 19:45.363
What do you think?
I'm gonna talk to the fat one.

19:45.365 --> 19:46.898
Fat ones
always leak information.

19:46.900 --> 19:48.266
I'm gonna interrogate
these broads.

19:48.268 --> 19:50.136
I don't think that's necessary.

19:50.138 --> 19:52.639
All right.

19:52.641 --> 19:53.573
Do you hear that?

19:53.575 --> 19:56.043
That's the pace they're
gonna fuck you in prison.

19:56.045 --> 19:57.544
All right.
Oh, Jesus.

19:57.546 --> 20:01.116
Fuck, fuck, fuck.
Dick in your butt.

20:01.118 --> 20:03.085
And it never stops.

20:03.087 --> 20:04.920
Hey, ladies!
Let's have a chat.

20:04.922 --> 20:06.122
Come here.
Stop right there.

20:06.124 --> 20:09.960
Let's get you out of here,
brother. Come on.

20:10.228 --> 20:11.996
Dude, I'm so sorry.

20:11.998 --> 20:13.898
I'm so sorry about all this.
That guy is...

20:13.900 --> 20:15.834
Uh, if you can believe it,
he's my boss.

20:15.836 --> 20:18.904
And I think he's a legitimate
psychopath, so...

20:18.906 --> 20:21.007
Ah, I think my left boob
deflated a bit.

20:21.009 --> 20:22.809
Like, I was feeling my tits
this morning.

20:22.811 --> 20:25.479
And it just feels way smaller
than my right.

20:25.481 --> 20:26.981
I mean, I think that's normal.

20:26.983 --> 20:29.351
One's also normally bigger
than the other.

20:29.353 --> 20:30.485
Really?
Yeah.

20:30.487 --> 20:32.922
Oh, that's awesome.
Definitely.

20:32.924 --> 20:33.956
Yeah.

20:33.958 --> 20:35.158
Um, problem though, I don't feel

20:35.160 --> 20:37.194
like I'm getting stimulated
by nipple play.

20:37.196 --> 20:39.596
What?
That's not a problem.

20:39.598 --> 20:41.466
Everyone's stimulated
by different things.

20:41.468 --> 20:44.637
Yeah. I've just been,
like, experimenting.

20:44.639 --> 20:46.806
Touching myself, watching porno.

20:46.808 --> 20:47.673
Wait. What?

20:47.675 --> 20:50.377
Are we doing...? Are you
saying we're doing porn now?

20:50.379 --> 20:51.545
Yeah.
Hell, yeah!

20:51.547 --> 20:52.847
You guys, the map's up.

20:52.849 --> 20:55.883
Yeah? Is it? Cool. Kill
yourself, Dora the explorer.

20:55.885 --> 20:58.887
"Map's up."
I don't give a fuck.

21:04.829 --> 21:06.797
Come on.

21:06.799 --> 21:08.365
Come on, god.

21:29.059 --> 21:30.260
Oh, that's slick.

21:30.262 --> 21:31.762
God, you are stupid as fuck.

21:31.764 --> 21:33.663
So, Kelly, what, you just
gonna milk this all day?

21:33.665 --> 21:36.968
Wait. Kelly, um, did you wait
to open your letter with us?

21:36.970 --> 21:38.437
I actually wanted to talk...

21:38.439 --> 21:39.338
Okay, let's just go.

21:39.340 --> 21:41.106
We don't have time
for these losers.

21:41.108 --> 21:42.274
I'm sorry.
What was that, cunt?

21:42.276 --> 21:43.910
Are you guys gonna go
to the party tonight?

21:43.912 --> 21:46.646
Are you guys going?
We'll be there, but you won't.

21:46.648 --> 21:47.882
Because you're really weird.

21:47.884 --> 21:50.451
I mean, did you even remember
to shower this morning?

21:50.453 --> 21:52.821
No, I did last night.
It's the same. Everyone knows.

21:52.823 --> 21:55.358
Marisa, did you even remember
to apply for college?

21:55.360 --> 21:57.160
I know things
can get hard for you.

21:57.162 --> 21:58.895
Yeah, they do.
They're called dicks.

21:58.897 --> 22:00.430
Dicks get really hard
for me, Brooke.

22:00.432 --> 22:02.966
- It's okay.
- Don't beat yourself up over it.

22:02.968 --> 22:06.704
We don't want that whole
situation happening again.

22:07.072 --> 22:09.008
Oh, when you pissed your bed
in middle school?

22:09.010 --> 22:12.012
That did not happen.
But it did though.

22:12.014 --> 22:14.414
Uh, Annie, sweetheart,
we can tell that your boobs

22:14.416 --> 22:16.717
are two different sizes
in that shirt.

22:16.719 --> 22:19.921
What? How?

22:19.923 --> 22:20.889
Can you really tell?
No.

22:20.891 --> 22:23.659
You're wearing a sports bra.
Why would she say that?

22:23.661 --> 22:24.861
Because she's a bitch,

22:24.863 --> 22:27.230
and she probably
has a secret ball sack.

22:42.217 --> 22:44.618
I would shove his dick
so far down

22:44.620 --> 22:46.221
my fucking esophagus, Annie.

22:46.223 --> 22:48.990
Oh, my god.
That would hurt so bad.

22:48.992 --> 22:51.794
All right, guys.
Jesse.

22:51.796 --> 22:54.364
Yo. Yo, J...
Yo!

22:54.366 --> 22:57.567
Welcome to your last homeroom
of the year!

23:00.473 --> 23:02.507
So here we are,
the last day of the semester.

23:02.509 --> 23:04.843
And I promise,
I don't know where the party is.

23:04.845 --> 23:06.613
And even if I knew,
I'd never tell you.

23:06.615 --> 23:08.982
Though, I really don't get
what's the big deal.

23:08.984 --> 23:11.018
I guess some traditions
keep on growing,

23:11.020 --> 23:12.019
no matter how stupid.

23:12.021 --> 23:14.188
I have to say though,
I wish I saw

23:14.190 --> 23:16.791
half of the creativity
I see in your party clues

23:16.793 --> 23:17.559
in your papers.

23:17.561 --> 23:21.330
You're fucking hilarious.

23:21.665 --> 23:27.305
So for the last time this year,
can anyone spell my last name?

23:27.940 --> 23:30.942
Anyone besides Jorge?

23:31.311 --> 23:32.244
Yeah, just what I thought.

23:32.246 --> 23:35.515
Okay, Mexico is your neighbor,
baronesses.

23:36.251 --> 23:38.018
Oh, you know that one? Good.

23:38.020 --> 23:41.055
So you might wanna think
about learning the language.

23:41.057 --> 23:43.357
Oh, and I suppose
we should probably address this.

23:43.359 --> 23:46.862
Oh, yeah.
They're... they're, ah, tits.

23:50.367 --> 23:52.336
Look, whatever.
Dude, the "beeramyd"

23:52.338 --> 23:54.138
tonight is gonna be epic, okay?

23:54.140 --> 23:56.608
It's gonna be like
the most lit night

23:56.610 --> 23:58.109
in school history ever.

23:58.111 --> 23:59.210
The almighty beeramyd.

23:59.212 --> 24:00.713
So that's it,
you finish high school.

24:00.715 --> 24:02.548
And then you create
this weird monument

24:02.550 --> 24:04.317
to celebrate
your future alcoholism.

24:04.319 --> 24:06.219
Yeah, like current alcoholism.

24:07.156 --> 24:08.455
Look, just, like, take a break

24:08.457 --> 24:12.393
from being, like, divorced
and, like, sad and, like, poor.

24:12.395 --> 24:13.462
You should come tonight.

24:13.464 --> 24:15.397
I mean, like, literally,
what else are you doing?

24:15.399 --> 24:18.702
I honestly don't know
where the party is, really.

24:18.704 --> 24:20.303
And I got some finals to grade.

24:20.305 --> 24:23.541
And gotta say, lately,
a glass of Pinot and I'm out.

24:23.543 --> 24:26.044
I'm out too.
I love Pinot.

24:26.046 --> 24:26.812
Pinot. Always.

24:35.123 --> 24:36.991
Oh, no.

24:36.993 --> 24:38.994
What?

24:40.129 --> 24:41.262
Shut up, bitch.

24:41.264 --> 24:44.033
God, your curls are just doing
a thing today that...

24:44.035 --> 24:48.572
Good summer, right?
Have a good one.

24:55.715 --> 24:57.116
Annie?

24:59.654 --> 25:01.554
What happened?

25:01.556 --> 25:04.692
I had a panic attack.

25:05.728 --> 25:08.363
You're my panic attack.

25:08.365 --> 25:11.400
Thanks. Marisa,
I just don't get it.

25:11.402 --> 25:13.903
It was Kelly's idea
to always stay together,

25:13.905 --> 25:15.671
and have each other's backs.

25:16.842 --> 25:19.543
Yeah, well...

25:20.046 --> 25:21.780
Shit happens.

25:23.383 --> 25:24.417
Did you hear what I said?

25:24.419 --> 25:26.252
- I hate this.
- Yes, I heard.

25:26.254 --> 25:27.820
I hate today.
I heard you.

25:27.822 --> 25:31.358
Okay, well,
fuck today, then, dude.

25:31.360 --> 25:33.327
We don't need...

25:33.329 --> 25:34.095
Today.

25:34.097 --> 25:37.399
Let's... let's, uh, go to
the strip club.

25:37.401 --> 25:40.369
I've always wanted
to go to the strip club.

25:40.371 --> 25:42.138
I don't know about that.

25:42.140 --> 25:44.074
It's not her fault, you know?

25:45.278 --> 25:47.111
It is, though, like...

25:47.113 --> 25:49.180
She deleted our pictures
off Facebook.

25:49.182 --> 25:50.949
Like, she didn't
have to go there.

25:50.951 --> 25:53.151
It's super disrespectful.

25:53.153 --> 25:54.687
I was kind of insulted
a little bit.

25:54.689 --> 25:56.222
Doesn't it make you feel bad

25:56.224 --> 25:57.590
that she's not allowed
to be herself?

25:57.592 --> 26:01.195
No. Because you always have
the option to be yourself.

26:01.197 --> 26:03.031
That is solely up to you.

26:03.033 --> 26:05.166
I can't believe
we don't talk anymore.

26:05.168 --> 26:07.036
We used to be so close
before you left.

26:07.038 --> 26:08.904
Hey, don't cry.

26:08.906 --> 26:12.576
I actually thought
today would be different.

26:12.578 --> 26:13.677
Annie.

26:13.679 --> 26:16.247
Come on, babe.
Just wipe up and come out, yeah?

26:16.249 --> 26:18.750
I can't.
Yes, you can.

26:18.752 --> 26:20.285
No, literally, I can't.

26:20.287 --> 26:22.054
I had a thing of Parmesan
for breakfast.

26:22.056 --> 26:23.490
- Why?
- It looked good.

26:23.492 --> 26:26.092
No. Why would you do that...?
That makes me angry.

26:26.094 --> 26:27.228
I don't...

26:27.230 --> 26:30.297
God, I'm spraying shit all over
the sides of the toilet.

26:30.299 --> 26:33.335
It's like the part that the
flush doesn't get. I'm sorry.

26:33.337 --> 26:36.539
Okay. It's okay.

26:38.075 --> 26:38.975
Annie?

26:38.977 --> 26:42.446
I got to go pee too.

26:44.250 --> 26:45.416
Are you there?

26:45.418 --> 26:47.051
Kelly, can you
just leave us alone?

26:47.053 --> 26:48.087
Okay, for just today?

26:48.089 --> 26:50.122
I was trying to
go to the bathroom.

26:50.124 --> 26:50.956
Okay, go in the gym.

26:50.958 --> 26:52.859
- Can we please just talk...?
- Hall passes.

26:52.861 --> 26:54.027
Andy, are you shitting me, dude?

26:54.029 --> 26:56.697
It is the last day of school.
You are not a Navy seal.

26:56.699 --> 27:00.569
Okay, well, that was
inappropriate language.

27:00.571 --> 27:01.803
Offensive clothing.

27:01.805 --> 27:05.375
And the verdict for both
of you is detention.

27:05.377 --> 27:06.543
What?
Fuck you.

27:06.545 --> 27:07.744
Yeah, uh-huh.

27:07.746 --> 27:09.446
And I hope your
computer crashes,

27:09.448 --> 27:11.448
and you lose shit
you didn't save.

27:11.450 --> 27:12.616
Take that back.
No.

27:12.618 --> 27:14.553
Please take that back.
No, I will not.

27:14.555 --> 27:15.620
Andy, Andy, Andy.

27:15.622 --> 27:18.024
You know, it is the very
last day of school.

27:18.026 --> 27:20.326
Andy, you're so cute.
No, I'm not.

27:20.328 --> 27:21.662
You are. Do you think
you could just

27:21.664 --> 27:25.132
let us off the hook
just this one time, please?

27:25.134 --> 27:26.067
Well...

27:26.069 --> 27:28.670
Pretty please?
Sure. Okay.

27:28.672 --> 27:29.738
I don't think so.

27:29.740 --> 27:32.474
The only thing getting
hard today is your lives.

27:32.476 --> 27:35.979
Because your evil voodoo-vagina
magic doesn't work on me.

27:35.981 --> 27:37.814
Because I masturbated
this morning,

27:37.816 --> 27:40.151
and I'm good till
9 or 9:30.

27:40.153 --> 27:43.222
Maybe if it was 9:45
and I was alone in my room,

27:43.224 --> 27:45.424
we could've worked
something out.

27:45.426 --> 27:49.429
All right.
Here you are.

27:49.431 --> 27:50.831
Have a nice day, ladies.

27:50.833 --> 27:51.665
Thank you.

27:51.667 --> 27:53.934
Let's all hang out sometime.

27:54.302 --> 27:56.538
You know, Andy,
I hope you fucking

27:56.540 --> 27:59.609
sneeze and shit yourself
on accident, dude.

27:59.611 --> 28:02.445
And slip and fall
in a puddle of shitty...

28:02.447 --> 28:03.080
What?

28:03.082 --> 28:04.314
...shit-covered rhino dicks.

28:04.316 --> 28:06.650
I don't have a charger.

28:07.453 --> 28:09.587
Thank you.

28:11.524 --> 28:13.759
Okay, if your application
was so perfect, Kelly,

28:13.761 --> 28:16.129
then why do you need
my approval?

28:16.131 --> 28:18.565
I just need your signature.

28:20.270 --> 28:22.703
Must be nice having
it all figured out, huh?

28:22.705 --> 28:23.471
Excuse me?

28:23.473 --> 28:24.606
I know you hired an outside

28:24.608 --> 28:26.308
college counselor to help you.

28:26.310 --> 28:27.442
Probably to spite me.

28:27.444 --> 28:29.712
No, actually.
It's because you seem unwell.

28:29.714 --> 28:32.416
You'll go to Stanford.
Oh, yeah, sure, you'll love it.

28:32.418 --> 28:35.653
An amazing job will just fall
into that creamy lap.

28:35.655 --> 28:38.456
You'll fall in love
with a doctor

28:38.458 --> 28:40.458
with a devastating jawline.

28:40.460 --> 28:43.029
I had a man like that once.

28:43.330 --> 28:45.299
Should I say he had me?

28:45.301 --> 28:46.266
What?

28:46.268 --> 28:48.802
Listen, this doesn't work on me.

28:50.106 --> 28:51.239
I don't care, okay?

28:51.241 --> 28:53.609
Okay, can you please
just sign my application,

28:53.611 --> 28:54.843
so I can turn it in today?

28:54.845 --> 28:56.612
Oh, god. It's not due
for three weeks.

28:56.614 --> 28:59.049
You don't get extra credit
for handing it in early.

28:59.051 --> 29:01.284
Such a you thing to do.
My mother is planning

29:01.286 --> 29:03.020
a going-away party
for the application.

29:03.022 --> 29:05.189
We're all gonna gather
around the mailbox,

29:05.191 --> 29:07.526
and she invited
all of her friends.

29:07.528 --> 29:09.628
What if you don't get in?

29:09.630 --> 29:12.365
Can you please
just sign my application?

29:12.367 --> 29:14.702
No, I cannot.

29:16.972 --> 29:19.441
How's your tummy?
You're looking a little pale.

29:19.443 --> 29:21.109
Killing it, but pale.

29:21.111 --> 29:23.379
Thank you.
I wonder where the party is.

29:23.381 --> 29:24.380
Here.

29:24.382 --> 29:27.117
God, I look pale?
Do you have, uh, like, makeup?

29:27.119 --> 29:29.286
What, have we met?

29:29.288 --> 29:32.690
Yo, I been meaning
to ask you, um...

29:32.692 --> 29:35.160
you been masturbating?
Yeah.

29:35.162 --> 29:37.529
Yeah, how much?
The usual amount.

29:37.531 --> 29:38.797
Why? Did you hear something?

29:38.799 --> 29:40.266
Um...

29:40.268 --> 29:41.901
Well, what's, like,
your average?

29:41.903 --> 29:44.872
Probably three to five times...
A day?

29:44.874 --> 29:46.841
Oh, my god.
What, are you like a guy?

29:46.843 --> 29:50.812
No, obviously not. Like,
three to five times a week.

29:50.814 --> 29:52.348
What? That's it?

29:52.350 --> 29:53.282
Okay.

29:53.284 --> 29:54.751
Look, I don't know,
okay? Honestly.

29:54.753 --> 29:56.053
How many times do you do it?
Whoa.

29:56.055 --> 30:00.458
Annie. Um, personal.
I don't know.

30:00.460 --> 30:01.693
Like 35 times a day.

30:01.695 --> 30:04.330
Fuck. Are you kidding me?
I'm messing with you.

30:04.332 --> 30:06.832
Oh, the whole time.

30:06.834 --> 30:10.937
God.
I rode my bed the other day.

30:10.939 --> 30:12.038
O-oh?

30:12.040 --> 30:14.208
I dry-humped the corner
of my mattress.

30:14.210 --> 30:16.444
Well...
probably gonna do it again.

30:16.446 --> 30:18.380
Good for you.
Yup. It was cool.

30:18.382 --> 30:21.217
How do you know
if you find your clitoris?

30:21.219 --> 30:26.524
I'm touching down there,
feels great, could be better.

30:26.526 --> 30:30.395
You just pop the hood.

30:30.397 --> 30:31.596
Okay. Cool.

30:47.585 --> 30:48.517
Annie.

30:48.519 --> 30:50.687
Let me holler at you for a sec.

30:50.689 --> 30:53.590
Let me spit you
something I wrote.

30:55.895 --> 30:57.462
No, no, no.

30:57.464 --> 30:59.465
You know what,
I'm gonna go off top.

30:59.467 --> 31:00.466
I'm gonna go off top.

31:00.468 --> 31:03.169
I just wanna let you know
that you're beautiful.

31:03.171 --> 31:05.738
That I feel you, you know?

31:05.740 --> 31:08.075
I feel like...

31:08.077 --> 31:09.977
Like we're the same
in a sort of way, you know?

31:09.979 --> 31:13.248
Honestly, if I came here tonight
and I didn't say anything,

31:13.250 --> 31:15.016
I'd be mad regretful,

31:15.018 --> 31:17.753
so here's me saying...

31:18.622 --> 31:20.090
I think we'd be great together.

31:20.092 --> 31:23.962
I just think we'd be lit.
I've always thought so.

31:23.964 --> 31:25.964
So, what's up?

31:25.966 --> 31:28.200
You with it?

31:28.602 --> 31:30.703
Well, this is so unexpected.

31:30.705 --> 31:33.006
Damn. Hot damn.

31:33.008 --> 31:35.308
Oh, hey.

31:36.010 --> 31:37.144
Oh!

31:37.146 --> 31:39.647
Chug-offs aren't fair.
You don't have a gag reflex.

31:39.649 --> 31:42.784
Yeah, I do. I'm a champ.
I'm fucking queen of the world!

31:42.786 --> 31:44.419
Oh, okay.

31:44.421 --> 31:47.323
You ever seen
an uncircumcised penis?

31:47.325 --> 31:49.527
Yeah, um...

31:49.529 --> 31:51.195
you seen those videos of, like,

31:51.197 --> 31:54.432
people giving birth
and the baby's head crowning?

31:54.434 --> 31:57.002
What? No.
Pushing through? No?

31:57.004 --> 31:58.504
Mm-mm.
Uh, what about, like,

31:58.506 --> 31:59.605
those sausage biscuits?

31:59.607 --> 32:03.443
A little, uh, pig in a blanket?

32:03.945 --> 32:05.647
No. I've no idea.

32:05.649 --> 32:06.848
I'm starving.

32:06.850 --> 32:09.785
You hungry?
Not anymore.

32:09.787 --> 32:13.756
Actually, yes, I'm very hungry.
Annie.

32:13.758 --> 32:15.692
Is that Sarah Richter?

32:15.694 --> 32:18.496
- Oh, wow!
- She looks different,

32:18.498 --> 32:20.097
but that is her.

32:20.099 --> 32:22.668
She's the new custodian.

32:22.670 --> 32:25.203
Annie, she's a janitor.

32:25.205 --> 32:28.908
Bet she probably just cleaned
the shit out of the toilet.

32:28.910 --> 32:31.245
No. No.
Yeah.

32:31.247 --> 32:32.446
Oh, I hope not.

32:32.448 --> 32:34.014
Oh, my god,
dude, she's pregnant.

32:34.016 --> 32:37.018
Remember when we egged her
freshman year?

32:37.020 --> 32:40.289
I almost feel bad.

32:40.291 --> 32:41.190
Almost.

32:41.192 --> 32:43.327
You know what?
I would not mind

32:43.329 --> 32:44.761
getting knocked up one day.

32:44.763 --> 32:45.896
What?

32:45.898 --> 32:47.365
I'm just saying, like...

32:47.367 --> 32:48.433
I don't wanna have a kid,

32:48.435 --> 32:50.001
but, yeah,
I wanna get knocked up.

32:50.003 --> 32:51.035
Okay.

32:51.037 --> 32:52.738
I feel like orgasms
are hard to come by.

32:52.740 --> 32:55.274
Probably.
I came close once at a recital.

32:55.276 --> 32:56.409
Yeah?
Yes.

32:56.411 --> 32:58.712
I actually just peed.
But it was really warm,

32:58.714 --> 32:59.914
and it felt really good.

32:59.916 --> 33:01.182
What the fuck?

33:01.184 --> 33:03.918
Okay, hold on.
So you and Phil.

33:03.920 --> 33:05.654
Wait. Wait a sec, okay?

33:05.656 --> 33:07.956
Kelly still loves us.
It doesn't matter,

33:07.958 --> 33:09.892
regardless of the letters
and other girls.

33:09.894 --> 33:12.496
Shut the fuck up about Kelly.

33:12.498 --> 33:14.398
All right?
Just, like, stop.

33:14.400 --> 33:16.835
You don't think
about our future, do you?

33:16.837 --> 33:18.403
Everything's gonna change
next year.

33:18.405 --> 33:20.940
I'm living in the moment.
If you got a foot in the past,

33:20.942 --> 33:24.010
and a foot in the future,
you're pissing on the present.

33:24.012 --> 33:27.514
Sure. Um,
what do I got to do?

33:27.516 --> 33:30.118
Really?
Yeah.

33:30.120 --> 33:31.085
I wanna go to the party.

33:31.087 --> 33:32.286
If our friendship's dying,

33:32.288 --> 33:35.424
then you know I wanna be
at that funeral.

33:35.426 --> 33:37.126
Okay.

33:37.128 --> 33:37.827
I'll go.

33:37.829 --> 33:40.530
But, uh, we gotta do something
I've been wanting to do

33:40.532 --> 33:43.267
for a real long time.

33:43.269 --> 33:44.168
Ha, ha!

33:44.170 --> 33:45.803
Okay. All right.

33:45.805 --> 33:47.239
Okay.

34:29.993 --> 34:31.960
This just feels
a little extreme, Marisa,

34:31.963 --> 34:34.630
breaking the law and everything.
I don't wanna go to jail.

34:34.632 --> 34:35.965
I'm not ready
to be a lesbian yet.

34:35.967 --> 34:37.935
No, baby,
you don't gotta be gay to play.

34:37.937 --> 34:40.405
Oh!
Just testing it out.

34:40.407 --> 34:41.239
Look, I got this.

34:41.241 --> 34:45.010
All right? I got me. I got you.
I got us. I got a game plan.

34:45.012 --> 34:47.045
We got this in the fucking bag.
Okay.

34:47.047 --> 34:49.315
Just breathe,
count to, like, 30.

34:49.318 --> 34:50.550
Got it. Okay. Good luck.

34:50.552 --> 34:52.853
It's fine. I'll be back.
Okay. Have fun.

34:52.856 --> 34:54.889
Don't fucking move, Annie.

34:54.891 --> 34:55.757
Okay.

35:03.068 --> 35:04.234
Fuck.

35:10.244 --> 35:12.544
Okay, okay, okay.

35:19.922 --> 35:22.957
Run, bitch! Go! Let's go!

35:22.959 --> 35:26.395
Go, go, go!
I got the money, bunny.

35:26.763 --> 35:30.065
I am living in this moment!

35:30.067 --> 35:32.435
Oh, my god.

35:36.476 --> 35:38.543
We did it! That's how we do.

35:38.545 --> 35:40.045
That's how we do.

35:44.085 --> 35:45.251
Let's scratch off.

35:45.253 --> 35:46.953
Keep that
high spirit rolling, Annie.

35:46.955 --> 35:51.293
Come on! Dude, shake your hand.
I can't. I'm driving.

35:51.295 --> 35:53.195
Oh, my god.

35:53.197 --> 35:54.262
Oh, my god.

35:54.264 --> 35:57.033
Oh, where did he
get a brick though?

35:57.035 --> 35:58.134
Dude, fuck if I know.

35:58.136 --> 35:59.703
He's an old man.
What? Maybe...

35:59.705 --> 36:00.938
He had it, like, sitting around

36:00.940 --> 36:02.806
for exactly this situation
and took it.

36:02.808 --> 36:05.810
He knew what was happening.
Annie, that is fucked up!

36:05.812 --> 36:08.614
I love it!
I love it so much.

36:08.616 --> 36:10.883
Dude, I know old man withers
couldn't catch up with me.

36:10.885 --> 36:14.120
Like, fuck the system.
Corporate America is going down.

36:14.122 --> 36:17.625
I am the conspiracy theory.
Yeah.

36:17.627 --> 36:19.093
Yeah. Okay.

36:19.095 --> 36:22.464
We do gotta fix the car though.
Dude, we're rich, bitch.

36:22.466 --> 36:25.201
We'll just buy a new one.
I do not want a new one.

36:25.203 --> 36:26.803
I gotta have this car.
I got this

36:26.805 --> 36:28.838
for making the honor roll
every quarter.

36:28.840 --> 36:30.107
Nerd alert.

36:30.109 --> 36:32.576
Stop. Don't dance.
Don't dance.

36:32.578 --> 36:35.580
And you're for sure gonna go
to the party now. For sure.

36:35.582 --> 36:37.316
Yeah, I know. I...

36:37.318 --> 36:40.753
Yeah, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna be there.

36:41.088 --> 36:43.590
We've never even broken 20
on scratchers.

36:43.592 --> 36:45.994
We never had the whole case.

36:45.996 --> 36:47.095
That's true.

36:47.097 --> 36:50.165
That's true. We got it.
Just look at 'em, Annie.

36:50.167 --> 36:51.100
God, so beautiful.

36:51.102 --> 36:54.070
I cannot wait to go shopping
for dresses tonight.

36:54.072 --> 36:56.273
Me too. We can,
like, get manicures.

36:56.275 --> 36:59.677
I think, like, maybe a hike
or, like, yoga.

36:59.679 --> 37:01.846
'Cause, like, my chakras
have just been

37:01.848 --> 37:03.248
really out of whack lately.

37:03.250 --> 37:04.883
Kombucha to open...
I get the joke.

37:04.885 --> 37:06.318
...my chest chakra.
I get it. Okay.

37:06.320 --> 37:08.855
We had a deal.
And we also have to fix my whip.

37:08.857 --> 37:10.623
Oh, are we calling it a whip?

37:10.625 --> 37:14.061
Yes, I like that term.
Just needed to clarify.

37:14.063 --> 37:15.630
Totally. Um...

37:15.632 --> 37:17.132
A deal's a deal.

37:17.134 --> 37:19.235
But I'm wearing this.

37:19.237 --> 37:21.837
You look so good.
Thank you.

37:21.839 --> 37:24.641
I have an idea.
Hm?

37:24.643 --> 37:28.212
So suck on my penis.

37:41.496 --> 37:45.434
Knock-knock.
Hi, how's my girl?

37:46.002 --> 37:47.469
Okay.

37:47.471 --> 37:49.105
Just okay?

37:49.107 --> 37:50.573
Uh-uh. Not today.

37:50.575 --> 37:53.344
It's the day we've
all been waiting for.

37:53.346 --> 37:54.244
Who's "we"?

37:54.246 --> 37:56.347
You know you can be excited
about this, right?

37:56.349 --> 37:58.750
Shouldn't you be getting ready
for the party?

37:58.752 --> 38:03.055
Yeah, um. Mom, I kind of wanted
to talk to you about that. I...

38:03.057 --> 38:04.390
I think I just kind of expected

38:04.392 --> 38:07.060
something different
out of today, and, um...

38:07.062 --> 38:09.196
I don't know, like,
my friends at school...

38:09.198 --> 38:11.566
Honey, just enjoy the ride.

38:11.568 --> 38:12.333
Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

38:12.335 --> 38:13.802
I mean, that's all
I'm trying to do

38:13.804 --> 38:16.839
is just enjoy the ride.
But I feel like I just need

38:16.841 --> 38:17.741
a moment to just be.

38:17.743 --> 38:20.243
This is your moment
to "just be."

38:20.245 --> 38:21.044
you won.

38:21.046 --> 38:23.814
I don't know
what that means, "I won."

38:23.816 --> 38:24.615
Honey.

38:24.617 --> 38:26.385
I just feel like
I can't catch my breath,

38:26.387 --> 38:28.720
you know
what I'm saying? Like...

38:28.722 --> 38:29.921
I just... I just need to...

38:29.923 --> 38:33.393
Try on this gorgeous dress.

38:34.028 --> 38:36.430
I don't wanna go to the party.

38:36.432 --> 38:38.500
What? No,
you have to go to the party.

38:38.502 --> 38:40.068
It wouldn't be the same
without you.

38:40.070 --> 38:44.040
And you owe it to those kids
that look up to you.

38:46.076 --> 38:47.978
I'm just gonna rest
for a minute,

38:47.980 --> 38:50.647
before I have to go back
to detention.

38:50.649 --> 38:52.950
Detention? What...?

38:52.952 --> 38:54.786
Is this about a boy?

38:54.788 --> 38:56.321
No.
Don't tell me.

38:56.323 --> 38:57.890
I'll find out.
I'll find out.

38:57.892 --> 39:00.827
And besides,
I can't cancel the limo anyway,

39:00.829 --> 39:01.694
and all the girls are in.

39:01.696 --> 39:03.631
You didn't.
Yes, I did.

39:09.540 --> 39:11.873
How rude of me. Shrimp?

39:11.875 --> 39:14.343
The smell is enough for me.
Thanks.

39:14.345 --> 39:16.513
I'd open the window
but they're painted shut.

39:16.515 --> 39:19.650
Rumor has it the last Counselor
leapt to her death.

39:19.652 --> 39:21.019
Oh, my god. Is that true?

39:21.021 --> 39:23.455
I don't know.
I block out a lot.

39:23.457 --> 39:25.624
A lot, a lot.

39:25.626 --> 39:28.662
So about signing my application?

39:28.664 --> 39:29.362
Yeah, okay.

39:29.364 --> 39:32.299
I will sign away, okay,
but I need you to do one thing.

39:32.301 --> 39:34.769
I need you to honor the pact
that you made

39:34.771 --> 39:35.837
with Annie and Marisa.

39:35.839 --> 39:37.039
It's that simple.

39:37.041 --> 39:38.340
How do you know about that?

39:38.342 --> 39:41.043
Annie wrote about it
in her personal statement.

39:41.045 --> 39:41.811
Really?

39:41.813 --> 39:44.280
That little meatball's got
a lot of faith in you.

39:44.282 --> 39:46.050
I told her,
"give up on your dreams,"

39:46.052 --> 39:48.319
just like I did when I married

39:48.321 --> 39:49.921
a sergeant and moved to Wichita.

39:49.923 --> 39:52.290
Little did I know
that I was about to enter

39:52.292 --> 39:54.927
four years of polygamy hell.

39:54.929 --> 39:58.031
My mother told me
I didn't look good in a bonnet,

39:58.033 --> 40:00.701
and I didn't listen.

40:00.969 --> 40:01.768
Wow, you actually have

40:01.770 --> 40:03.838
an amazing face for a bonnet.

40:03.840 --> 40:04.672
You know that?

40:04.674 --> 40:06.007
Can you please just sign
my application?

40:06.009 --> 40:08.878
I promise you if you don't,
my mother is going to call you,

40:08.880 --> 40:10.814
and I really don't think
you want that.

40:10.816 --> 40:13.884
Is your mother single?
Just curious.

40:13.886 --> 40:15.987
No, she's married to my dad.

40:15.989 --> 40:17.421
Okay. Jesus.

40:17.423 --> 40:20.159
A judgment's not gonna
do you well at Stanford.

40:20.161 --> 40:22.027
Oh, wait, yes, it will.

40:22.029 --> 40:23.863
I'm not impressed, babe.

40:23.865 --> 40:26.132
I see one of you every year.

40:26.134 --> 40:28.135
In, out, in, out.

40:28.137 --> 40:30.004
In more ways than one.

40:33.076 --> 40:36.946
We should get, like,
an off-roading Jeep.

40:36.948 --> 40:39.515
We can put our money together.

40:39.517 --> 40:40.651
Whip it, bitch!

40:40.653 --> 40:43.253
That's why
I fuck with you, Annie.

40:45.558 --> 40:48.427
- Oh, fuck.
- Okay, where the fuck are we?

40:48.429 --> 40:51.163
You just gotta trust me.
Have I ever let you down?

40:51.165 --> 40:53.466
No, you haven't.
No, I've never let you down.

40:53.468 --> 40:54.668
This is this guy's business.

40:54.670 --> 40:56.571
- This is his lobby to his office.
- Okay.

40:56.573 --> 40:58.439
And we're just waiting
for his services.

40:58.441 --> 41:00.241
It's strange.
It's a weird business.

41:00.243 --> 41:03.779
I can't get how it works.
No, no. He knows his clientele.

41:03.781 --> 41:04.847
Okay. Right.
Right?

41:04.849 --> 41:06.249
It's gonna be fine.
Okay, cool.

41:06.251 --> 41:07.951
I love you, queen.
I love you.

41:07.953 --> 41:09.954
Thank you. That helped.

41:09.956 --> 41:12.389
Hey, yo, Adrian!

41:13.727 --> 41:16.228
What up, little 'Risa?

41:16.230 --> 41:17.563
Yes. I love this guy.

41:17.565 --> 41:19.899
Hi. Uh,
just the back window.

41:19.901 --> 41:21.033
Dude, get your ass in the back.

41:21.035 --> 41:24.171
I know how to pay you
for your services.

41:24.706 --> 41:26.741
What? Don't do a blow job
with this guy.

41:26.743 --> 41:28.610
I've heard really bad stories
about dicks.

41:28.612 --> 41:31.447
Wait, Annie.
Bad dicks or bad stories?

41:31.449 --> 41:34.651
No, no. Sir, I'm just gonna have
to ask you to leave.

41:34.653 --> 41:36.853
I can't have
sexual relations in my car.

41:36.855 --> 41:38.489
I'm not gonna give him
a "blowgy."

41:38.491 --> 41:41.459
Dude, I don't even
have my stuff.

41:41.461 --> 41:44.429
Are you packing
fucking heat, yo?

41:44.431 --> 41:46.833
Hashtag OG, 80 percent indica,

41:46.835 --> 41:50.203
20 percent sativa,
100 percent dank. Ah.

41:50.205 --> 41:52.106
This shit will
melt your face off.

41:52.108 --> 41:55.410
How did you score this,
you little fucking genius?

41:55.412 --> 41:56.578
Grandma. Neuropathy.

41:56.580 --> 42:00.716
Dude, shit's sad,
but what can you do?

42:00.718 --> 42:03.152
All right.

42:03.154 --> 42:05.255
What else you got for me?

42:05.257 --> 42:09.360
Toss in some scratchies.

42:13.099 --> 42:13.866
All right, deal.

42:13.868 --> 42:16.236
You can pick it up
in a couple hours.

42:16.238 --> 42:18.071
I'll meet you back here.
Yes.

42:18.073 --> 42:19.005
Sounds good.
Great.

42:19.007 --> 42:20.508
Couple hours, great.
Deal.

42:20.510 --> 42:21.409
A couple hours?

42:21.411 --> 42:23.077
That timing
will work out perfect.

42:23.079 --> 42:24.178
You always got my back, dude.

42:24.180 --> 42:27.883
- You knows it.
- I really appreciate you.

42:33.491 --> 42:34.458
Adrian...

42:34.460 --> 42:37.295
Uh, just out of, like,
curiosity. Uh...

42:37.297 --> 42:39.998
Do you have any information

42:40.000 --> 42:42.935
on the location
of the party tonight?

42:42.937 --> 42:45.972
Either of you read Vonnegut?

42:45.974 --> 42:47.574
What?
Religiously.

42:47.576 --> 42:53.515
If you find the party,
if you don't, so it goes.

42:53.517 --> 42:56.452
Yeah. Yeah,
I like that.

42:56.454 --> 42:57.754
Okay. For sure.

42:57.756 --> 43:00.123
Just, uh, give me a call, okay?

43:00.125 --> 43:03.594
Thanks, bro.
God. He is the man.

43:03.596 --> 43:04.495
He's so loyal.

43:04.497 --> 43:06.331
No one has loyalty
like that anymore,

43:06.333 --> 43:10.870
except for you. You're my girl.
I was gonna say. Ha, ha.

43:10.872 --> 43:12.305
Um, sorry. Question.

43:12.307 --> 43:14.875
- How are we gonna get back?
- I'm getting us an Uber.

43:14.877 --> 43:17.277
And I know
where to get you a dress.

43:17.279 --> 43:18.278
So suck on my penis.

43:18.280 --> 43:21.182
- I'm sorry this happened to you.
- What an inconvenient day.

43:21.184 --> 43:24.487
We will get back to you as soon
as we know more information.

43:24.489 --> 43:25.721
Okay? Thank you so much.

43:25.723 --> 43:27.724
I'll call you.
Please don't.

43:30.095 --> 43:32.764
Okay, so we are
looking for two girls

43:32.766 --> 43:35.133
driving a vehicle
with a smashed-out windshield

43:35.135 --> 43:37.002
who have stolen
a case of scratchers.

43:37.004 --> 43:39.204
Great. Great.
I don't care, okay?

43:39.206 --> 43:41.107
It doesn't seem like
they'd be too far.

43:41.109 --> 43:43.109
This just happened.
It should be

43:43.111 --> 43:44.211
easy to spot the vehicle.
And?

43:44.213 --> 43:45.980
This information? Throw it away.
Yeah?

43:45.982 --> 43:48.083
I'll toss it.
Because I just got myself a text

43:48.085 --> 43:49.718
from a dweeb I've got
on the inside.

43:49.720 --> 43:51.286
Okay.
And he tells me he saw

43:51.288 --> 43:52.755
a couple of kids
rolling some kegs

43:52.757 --> 43:54.157
to a dirt lot five minutes
from here.

43:54.159 --> 43:56.125
You have childr...
An informant who's a child?

43:56.127 --> 43:58.395
A couple of high school kids.
Couple of...

43:58.397 --> 43:59.329
I give them burner phones.

43:59.331 --> 44:01.466
Little cricket...
Cricket burner phones.

44:01.468 --> 44:03.735
They text me
when they see something shady.

44:03.737 --> 44:06.172
If you see something,
say something.

44:06.174 --> 44:08.607
I'm saying something about that.
That seems shady.

44:08.609 --> 44:11.411
Our rules are protect,
serve and kill.

44:11.413 --> 44:13.781
Oh, I didn't know
that third one was included.

44:13.783 --> 44:15.016
Thought it was the first two.

44:15.018 --> 44:17.084
Protect, serve and kill.
A, B, C.

44:17.086 --> 44:18.187
Learn to be a cop.

44:18.189 --> 44:20.656
Learn to be a cop.
I'm trying.

44:20.658 --> 44:22.158
Embarrassing.

44:23.428 --> 44:25.028
My queen. I need my queen.

44:25.030 --> 44:26.764
- Are you ready?
- Yeah. Yes.

44:26.766 --> 44:29.300
I feel like I'm in
dancing with the stars.

44:29.302 --> 44:30.769
I'm gonna drop a beat.

44:45.254 --> 44:47.423
I love that one.

44:47.425 --> 44:48.724
That's my favorite one.

44:48.726 --> 44:50.159
It's kind of cool though, right?

44:50.161 --> 44:52.262
Yeah, I love...
The color's beautiful on you,

44:52.264 --> 44:54.264
but it's, uh... turn around.

44:55.434 --> 44:57.568
Is it...? Is it squeezing?

44:57.570 --> 44:59.238
Um, yeah, but I think
that's just my body.

44:59.240 --> 45:01.773
Clothing companies
don't make clothes for my body.

45:01.775 --> 45:02.808
No, it's... do another one.

45:02.810 --> 45:04.077
This might be tough to get off.

45:04.079 --> 45:06.112
If I scream, call the cops.
No, you call me

45:06.114 --> 45:09.083
because I'm your knight
in shining armor.

45:09.085 --> 45:11.318
I love you, baby.
Just slice it right off.

45:15.693 --> 45:18.261
Marisa? We gotta go.
What...? What's up?

45:18.263 --> 45:20.831
No, we're not going.
I wanna see more.

45:20.833 --> 45:22.366
I like this one. This...

45:22.368 --> 45:23.300
We have to go.

45:23.302 --> 45:24.669
No.

45:24.671 --> 45:25.737
No.

45:26.673 --> 45:28.841
Okay. Yeah, all right.

45:28.843 --> 45:30.309
No, go. Go. Go.
It hurts too.

45:30.311 --> 45:34.481
I will meet you.
It's dripping, Marisa.

45:36.752 --> 45:39.120
Man, everyone's waiting
to find out if Kelly got in.

45:39.122 --> 45:41.323
I bet she'll announce it
at the party tonight.

45:41.325 --> 45:44.860
Probably. Sure wish
you didn't give a shit.

45:44.862 --> 45:45.461
Yeah.

45:45.463 --> 45:47.230
I mean,
I get things got messed up.

45:47.232 --> 45:50.034
After you went to gram's,
I kind of freaked out.

45:50.036 --> 45:52.603
Maybe I just care too much
about honoring the right thing.

45:52.605 --> 45:56.341
Maybe I'm a modern-day Jedi.
I'm Mace Windu, you know?

45:56.343 --> 45:58.611
Yeah, you are. Totally.

45:58.613 --> 46:00.346
Remember our strokes cover band?

46:00.348 --> 46:03.684
Ha-ha-ha.
We rocked. We were good.

46:03.686 --> 46:04.885
We killed!

46:04.887 --> 46:06.421
No, Annie, you rocked.

46:06.423 --> 46:07.689
You're like the Michael Jordan

46:07.691 --> 46:09.891
of weird high-school girls
that play cello.

46:09.893 --> 46:12.928
No. You were so good on guitar.
I don't know why you stopped.

46:12.930 --> 46:15.265
Because I'm a quitter.
I'm the quitter.

46:15.267 --> 46:18.669
I'm a first-place quitter.

46:18.671 --> 46:20.571
Yes! Money!

46:20.573 --> 46:21.238
Make it rain.

46:21.240 --> 46:24.009
Uh-oh.

46:24.011 --> 46:25.777
Here we go.

46:29.483 --> 46:32.686
Don't you hate when you shit
and the tampon comes out?

46:32.688 --> 46:33.687
It's like, do I take it out

46:33.689 --> 46:36.858
or do I waste a new one,
or push it back in?

46:36.860 --> 46:37.826
Push it back in.

46:37.828 --> 46:39.962
You know gardeners
do crack in those?

46:39.964 --> 46:41.631
So? It's private.

46:41.633 --> 46:43.232
Shit, dude.
I have detention.

46:43.234 --> 46:45.235
Oh, my god. I wanna come.
I've never been.

46:45.237 --> 46:47.371
Um...
no, seriously, we gotta go.

46:47.373 --> 46:50.008
Okay.
This will be great.

47:01.391 --> 47:03.391
Annie, I never gave you
detention.

47:03.393 --> 47:05.594
Annie.

47:07.664 --> 47:08.665
I'm just here for fun.

47:08.667 --> 47:11.134
Well, this is gonna be
the opposite of fun,

47:11.136 --> 47:12.402
because here are
the rules... hey!

47:12.404 --> 47:14.872
Here are the rules
for Andy's detention,

47:14.874 --> 47:18.009
since no teacher wanted
to take it over, which means:

47:18.011 --> 47:21.347
No speaking, no thinking,
no breathing

47:21.349 --> 47:23.883
no being fat, no being ugly...

47:23.885 --> 47:25.184
Don't be annoying,

47:25.186 --> 47:28.055
and focus on no one

47:28.057 --> 47:29.322
but yourself.

47:29.324 --> 47:30.425
You! No talking.

47:30.427 --> 47:33.629
N-o-o, no.
I... I didn't...

47:33.631 --> 47:35.898
She didn't even do anything...
No. No.

47:35.900 --> 47:38.501
All right. I want all of you
to write me

47:38.503 --> 47:40.403
a very detailed essay

47:40.405 --> 47:42.139
on how to get a girlfriend.

47:42.141 --> 47:46.110
Uh, not that it's for me.
I'm asking for a friend.

47:46.112 --> 47:47.913
And be detailed.

47:47.915 --> 47:51.951
I want, minimum, 7000 words.

47:51.953 --> 47:54.087
All right? Pictures count

47:54.089 --> 47:55.155
as one word.
Annie.

47:55.157 --> 47:56.790
Hey! I don't
see you writing.

47:56.792 --> 48:00.261
Why are you looking at me?
Start writing.

48:06.503 --> 48:08.405
For those of you who are

48:08.407 --> 48:11.041
still here
for detention, unbelievable.

48:11.043 --> 48:13.377
Uh, also,
regarding this party tonight,

48:13.379 --> 48:14.512
guys, please be safe.

48:14.514 --> 48:17.883
Your old Princi-pal
still cares, after all.

48:24.927 --> 48:26.427
Uh, uh, uh.
Turn off your phones,

48:26.429 --> 48:29.397
or if that's a vibrator,
then go use that at home,

48:29.399 --> 48:30.732
you sick freaks.

48:30.734 --> 48:33.669
Phones where I can see them.

48:37.276 --> 48:38.242
Kelly. Kelly.

48:38.244 --> 48:40.545
Have a seat.
What?

48:40.547 --> 48:42.347
Hey, Marisa.
Marisa, I texted...

48:42.349 --> 48:45.084
Annie, check your...
Check Marisa's phone, please...

48:45.086 --> 48:48.487
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
You sound so crazy.

48:48.489 --> 48:51.224
I have a proposition for you.

48:51.226 --> 48:52.959
What do you want, Andy?

48:52.961 --> 48:56.697
I need to know
where that party is.

48:56.932 --> 48:58.600
Marisa!

48:58.602 --> 49:00.969
Marisa, wait!

49:00.971 --> 49:02.005
Kelly texted you?

49:02.007 --> 49:03.973
Yeah.
What did she text you?

49:03.975 --> 49:05.241
I don't know. I deleted it.

49:05.243 --> 49:07.511
You what?
What the hell is wrong with you?

49:07.513 --> 49:08.512
Marisa...

49:08.514 --> 49:10.015
What the fuck
is wrong with you, dude?

49:10.017 --> 49:12.684
You know, I'm starting
to take this personally.

49:12.686 --> 49:14.487
All right?
As your best friend, all day,

49:14.489 --> 49:16.823
we've been talking
about this fucking fantasy world

49:16.825 --> 49:18.425
that you are never
gonna live in.

49:18.427 --> 49:21.395
I wanna know what happened.
You don't know shit.

49:21.397 --> 49:22.497
You're stressing over a girl

49:22.499 --> 49:23.798
that does not give
a fuck about you.

49:23.800 --> 49:27.169
Get it together, dude.
Take the fucking pigtails out.

49:27.171 --> 49:28.370
Put your big-girl hat on.

49:28.372 --> 49:30.339
Because I'm tired of this.
You brought me

49:30.341 --> 49:31.875
to this fucking point today!

49:31.877 --> 49:34.578
People leave you.
They don't care!

49:34.580 --> 49:35.746
I don't think so.

49:35.748 --> 49:37.982
I don't care
what you fucking think,

49:37.984 --> 49:39.084
because I know.

49:39.086 --> 49:40.052
So you have fun at Cornell

49:40.054 --> 49:42.387
with your Ivy league
bullshit friends,

49:42.389 --> 49:43.923
but I'm out.

49:43.925 --> 49:45.692
Deuces.

50:34.720 --> 50:37.122
I cannot believe we did that.

50:37.124 --> 50:40.159
We are such cool best friends.

50:40.161 --> 50:42.329
What?

50:42.830 --> 50:46.401
Let's always be this way.
Let's always be this cool,

50:46.403 --> 50:49.337
- and this there for each other.
- Oh, my god, yes.

50:49.339 --> 50:50.639
I think that we should open

50:50.641 --> 50:52.808
our college
acceptance letters together

50:52.810 --> 50:56.179
at the end of that stupid party.

50:56.414 --> 50:57.948
Really?
Yes.

50:57.950 --> 50:59.617
That's a great idea.
That's amazing.

50:59.619 --> 51:01.419
Dead serious.
It'd be so meaningful.

51:01.421 --> 51:03.889
No, it's dope. Dope.

51:04.357 --> 51:06.558
You know what it's time for?

51:06.560 --> 51:07.460
What?

51:07.462 --> 51:09.228
Do you know what it's time for?

51:09.230 --> 51:11.365
- A group hug?
- Time for a group hug.

51:11.367 --> 51:15.770
Annie, is it group hug time?
Group hug. Get in here.

51:15.772 --> 51:18.039
I love you guys.

51:42.038 --> 51:45.140
Hey. Annie Legland.

51:56.689 --> 51:58.156
Ah.

51:59.592 --> 52:01.594
Hey, Phil.

52:07.735 --> 52:10.038
Grandma?

52:14.344 --> 52:16.545
Hey, baby.

52:17.781 --> 52:18.848
What are you doing here?

52:18.850 --> 52:21.117
What do you mean,
what am I doing here?

52:21.119 --> 52:22.887
I came to see you.

52:22.889 --> 52:24.455
To say hi.

52:31.365 --> 52:32.899
You seen the little sewing kit?

52:32.901 --> 52:35.602
I'm trying to fix
this button on my shirt.

52:35.604 --> 52:38.105
Hot date tonight?

52:38.440 --> 52:39.641
Yeah, actually.

52:39.643 --> 52:40.708
Met her online.

52:40.710 --> 52:42.210
Yeah. Don't need
to know the details.

52:42.212 --> 52:44.146
Marisa, hold up.
Dude, are you really

52:44.148 --> 52:46.315
trying to connect
with me right now?

52:46.317 --> 52:49.419
You came over for a sewing kit.

52:49.421 --> 52:50.687
I'm sorry. I just...

52:50.689 --> 52:53.357
No, but you're not, though.

52:55.327 --> 52:56.962
I have homework.

52:56.964 --> 52:59.431
Isn't it the last day?
Yup.

53:00.868 --> 53:02.502
Congratulations.

53:02.504 --> 53:04.472
Do you mind if I call you
tangerine?

53:04.474 --> 53:06.373
Yeah, I wish everybody
called me that.

53:06.375 --> 53:08.543
Tangy, I know you think
this stuff

53:08.545 --> 53:10.178
is all bullshit, okay?

53:10.180 --> 53:11.012
I do.

53:11.014 --> 53:12.147
I know people
like you. They say:

53:12.149 --> 53:14.550
"Oh, Mark Zuckerberg
dropped out of Harvard.

53:14.552 --> 53:15.718
Look at him now, right?"

53:15.720 --> 53:16.854
That's what I'm saying.

53:16.856 --> 53:18.155
Well, listen up.
To drop out,

53:18.157 --> 53:19.289
he had to get into Harvard,

53:19.291 --> 53:21.493
and to get into Harvard,
he had to apply.

53:21.495 --> 53:23.161
If he hadn't done that
he'd just be

53:23.163 --> 53:24.696
another sex offender
with a website.

53:24.698 --> 53:27.299
Can we please hang out
outside of school?

53:27.301 --> 53:29.870
Not till you're older.
Not till you're 18, or 21

53:29.872 --> 53:32.005
or whatever the legal age
is in this state.

53:32.007 --> 53:33.307
I forget, I move a lot.

53:33.309 --> 53:34.876
You've seen some shit, huh?

53:34.878 --> 53:36.043
Yeah. Okay?
Yeah.

53:36.045 --> 53:37.579
And you could too,
if you'd stop being

53:37.581 --> 53:39.214
this off-brand
version of yourself.

53:39.216 --> 53:42.585
Liz. Come on. That makes me feel
like a generic razor.

53:42.587 --> 53:45.255
Yes! Exactly.
See? You're smart.

53:45.257 --> 53:47.158
Just apply
to a state school, okay?

53:47.160 --> 53:50.061
You're gonna get in.
There'll be girls running around

53:50.063 --> 53:51.263
like, "where's my dad?"

53:51.265 --> 53:52.964
you know, you'll get along.
And, um...

53:52.966 --> 53:54.800
Let yourself
have a lesbian phase.

53:54.802 --> 53:57.270
It makes you
a better person and citizen.

53:57.272 --> 53:58.272
And not that you want to,

53:58.274 --> 53:59.540
but if you wanna be a mother,

53:59.542 --> 54:01.275
it'll make you
a better mother too.

54:01.277 --> 54:02.477
You're all right, Liz.

54:02.479 --> 54:05.813
You're not okay,
but you're all right.

54:05.815 --> 54:06.514
One last thing.

54:06.516 --> 54:08.484
Should the chance
present itself,

54:08.486 --> 54:09.552
please honor the pact you have

54:09.554 --> 54:13.123
with meatball
and Blondie McBonnet face.

54:15.360 --> 54:17.795
Hey, if I ever go through
that lesbian phase,

54:17.797 --> 54:20.165
I'm gonna call you.

54:20.400 --> 54:23.068
Oh, my god. Thank you.

54:24.471 --> 54:26.539
Voilà. What do you think?

54:26.541 --> 54:31.145
Oh, my god.
It looks like a cat.

54:31.147 --> 54:32.113
Oh, no.

54:32.115 --> 54:34.416
No, no. This is...
This is horribly wrong.

54:34.418 --> 54:38.020
What? It says "fab" on it?
Oh, lord, no.

54:38.022 --> 54:39.488
There are lips. Ah!

54:39.490 --> 54:41.391
And there's a decal
with your name on it.

54:41.393 --> 54:43.493
It's like Barney or something.
This is all wrong!

54:43.495 --> 54:45.797
This is criminally wrong,
what you've done to me.

54:45.799 --> 54:46.798
Do you understand that?

54:46.800 --> 54:47.832
I have the biggest party

54:47.834 --> 54:49.969
of my life tonight.
I cannot pull up in this.

54:49.971 --> 54:52.071
Everyone will think
I'm a stripper.

54:52.073 --> 54:53.006
That is not okay.

54:53.008 --> 54:53.873
Do you read Vonnegut?

54:53.875 --> 54:55.342
Yes, I do!
You already asked me.

54:55.344 --> 54:56.911
That's not
what we're talking about.

54:56.913 --> 54:59.380
So it goes.
No! No! No!

54:59.382 --> 55:02.351
It doesn't go.
I can't go anywhere in this car!

55:02.353 --> 55:03.352
I'm not gonna go!

55:03.354 --> 55:05.855
Please just, god, stop smoking.

55:05.857 --> 55:07.156
Save us all.

55:07.959 --> 55:10.394
Weed is a gateway drug,
okay? Just...

55:27.483 --> 55:30.219
Namaste.

55:48.643 --> 55:52.579
Smile!
We're going to college.

55:52.581 --> 55:56.318
Yay!
So exciting.

56:00.391 --> 56:01.757
Have fun, girls.

56:26.255 --> 56:27.389
This shit is rigged.

56:34.934 --> 56:38.470
- Hi, sweetheart. It's mom.
- Uh, just checking in.

56:38.472 --> 56:40.672
Hope everything is going
according to plan.

56:40.674 --> 56:41.707
I know it's your big night.

56:41.709 --> 56:43.843
I want everything
to go well for you.

56:43.845 --> 56:45.311
I got you two things for dinner.

56:45.313 --> 56:46.513
I got Italian and Chinese.

56:46.515 --> 56:48.181
I know you like
to have a little bit

56:48.183 --> 56:50.118
of selection
of what you're gonna eat.

57:22.792 --> 57:25.094
Nice whip.

57:48.858 --> 57:51.393
I miss us.

57:53.530 --> 57:55.231
What?

57:55.999 --> 57:59.803
That's what Kelly's
text message said.

58:00.605 --> 58:02.974
"I miss us."

58:05.545 --> 58:07.379
Oh.

58:07.781 --> 58:10.584
Why didn't you tell me that?

58:13.455 --> 58:16.023
Annie, why would I?

58:17.059 --> 58:18.393
Dude, I don't wanna lose you.

58:18.395 --> 58:19.628
You and Kelly, like, applied

58:19.630 --> 58:21.530
to the same schools
and everything.

58:21.532 --> 58:24.501
Places I have
no business being at.

58:25.169 --> 58:29.206
Dude, like, in my mind,
Kelly's the bitch.

58:29.908 --> 58:33.445
But you said
that Kelly turned on you.

58:33.447 --> 58:34.814
Okay, yeah, I...

58:34.816 --> 58:37.350
I say a lot of shit.

58:38.285 --> 58:40.821
God. I thought
you were my best friend.

58:40.823 --> 58:42.222
I am, Annie.

58:42.224 --> 58:45.360
That's the thing. You have me.
You have a family.

58:45.362 --> 58:49.865
You have a long list of people.
I have a very short list.

58:49.867 --> 58:53.537
Kelly doesn't wanna be
on mine. That's fine.

58:55.274 --> 58:57.241
You're my one person.

59:01.648 --> 59:06.052
She can't just, like, jump in
and out whenever she wants to.

59:06.054 --> 59:08.322
She left. She's gone.

59:08.324 --> 59:09.757
Crossed her off.

59:09.759 --> 59:12.694
One less person to care about.

59:13.963 --> 59:16.165
God.
I'm just gonna say it.

59:16.167 --> 59:19.335
I'm gonna go
make something of myself.

59:19.469 --> 59:21.939
You can't stand that, can you?

59:21.941 --> 59:24.041
You can't take it.

59:24.043 --> 59:25.476
You're scared
of what you may feel

59:25.478 --> 59:27.712
if you go
into the real world. Right?

59:27.714 --> 59:30.950
A place that isn't
shocked by your wit.

59:30.952 --> 59:32.819
A world that
actually values talent

59:32.821 --> 59:34.220
and hard work and honesty.

59:34.222 --> 59:37.058
The moment you felt pain
from your parents' divorce,

59:37.060 --> 59:40.394
you bailed on me
and you bailed on us.

59:40.396 --> 59:42.731
You wanna know
why I wanna get so far away?

59:42.733 --> 59:44.566
I wanna go,
so I don't end up like you...

59:44.568 --> 59:48.805
Sad and scared and just
fucking running away.

59:51.076 --> 59:53.177
Cool.

59:57.650 --> 01:00:00.686
I'm glad I could be
your motivation.

01:00:22.014 --> 01:00:23.949
ID, please?

01:00:23.951 --> 01:00:26.485
Look, ma'am, I just...

01:00:27.955 --> 01:00:31.525
Sarah Richter?
I swear, I saw you earlier.

01:00:31.527 --> 01:00:34.662
Gotta have more than
one job these days.

01:00:36.932 --> 01:00:38.733
Are you serious?

01:00:38.735 --> 01:00:39.902
This isn't even fake.

01:00:39.904 --> 01:00:42.471
This is your real ID
that says you're underage.

01:00:42.473 --> 01:00:44.007
Yeah, I know.

01:00:44.009 --> 01:00:47.244
Can you just,
like, cut me some slack?

01:00:47.246 --> 01:00:49.547
I just lost my best friend.

01:00:49.549 --> 01:00:50.415
Hm.

01:00:50.417 --> 01:00:53.018
One of those girls I saw
at that party?

01:00:53.020 --> 01:00:54.053
Yeah.

01:00:54.055 --> 01:00:56.121
Whatever you did,
don't worry about it.

01:00:56.123 --> 01:00:57.757
You're gonna do
a lot of stupid shit,

01:00:57.759 --> 01:01:00.661
especially when you're young.

01:01:00.663 --> 01:01:02.163
Yeah, who says that?

01:01:02.165 --> 01:01:03.130
I'm not even 25.

01:01:03.132 --> 01:01:07.135
I'm buried in credit card debt,
couldn't finish college.

01:01:07.137 --> 01:01:12.208
My only friend is my alcoholic
and unemployable boyfriend.

01:01:12.210 --> 01:01:16.447
Not to mention I have
a real-life baby on the way.

01:01:16.449 --> 01:01:19.250
So, yeah.

01:01:19.252 --> 01:01:21.654
Shit gets real.

01:01:21.656 --> 01:01:24.423
You'll know when it does.

01:01:25.492 --> 01:01:27.627
I really fucked up this time.

01:01:27.629 --> 01:01:31.466
Apologize, and then move on.

01:01:31.468 --> 01:01:32.433
And, you know,

01:01:32.435 --> 01:01:34.970
don't even take life
so seriously.

01:01:34.972 --> 01:01:37.339
No one gets out alive.

01:01:39.344 --> 01:01:40.877
Richter got jokes.

01:01:40.879 --> 01:01:43.047
That was a good one.

01:01:43.049 --> 01:01:44.982
Can I just...?

01:01:44.984 --> 01:01:48.453
If you get caught,
I did not sell that to you.

01:01:48.455 --> 01:01:52.158
Yes. You're gonna be
a tight-ass mom.

01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:54.026
You going to the party tonight?

01:01:54.028 --> 01:01:55.095
No.

01:01:55.097 --> 01:01:57.664
Dude, fuck that party.

01:03:31.316 --> 01:03:33.583
Oh, god. Fuck it.

01:03:33.585 --> 01:03:34.718
Here I come, Phil.

01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:37.889
You know what, Annie?

01:03:37.891 --> 01:03:39.558
I actually used
to be just like you:

01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:42.527
Young, talented,
still a mouth virgin.

01:03:42.529 --> 01:03:43.663
Heh. I had dreams too.

01:03:43.665 --> 01:03:47.467
And I chased those dreams
all the way down to Mexico.

01:03:47.469 --> 01:03:48.502
Despite the weight gain,

01:03:48.504 --> 01:03:50.404
I was actually
a very successful dancer.

01:03:50.406 --> 01:03:52.874
I'm learning about you today.
Today's not about me.

01:03:52.876 --> 01:03:54.876
It's about you,
Anna banana, okay?

01:03:54.878 --> 01:03:57.713
The point is, you need
to start living for you, okay?

01:03:57.715 --> 01:04:00.049
You can't wait around
for magic to come to you.

01:04:00.051 --> 01:04:02.452
It's gonna come in different
forms. It's gonna come to you

01:04:02.454 --> 01:04:06.291
in the form of a German juggler
with kind eyes who's a liar.

01:04:06.293 --> 01:04:08.761
Annie, he's a liar.

01:04:08.763 --> 01:04:10.696
Wait. I think there's
a difference

01:04:10.698 --> 01:04:12.164
between magic and a promise.

01:04:12.166 --> 01:04:13.900
I have faith
that Kelly and Marisa

01:04:13.902 --> 01:04:15.602
are gonna keep their promise.

01:04:15.604 --> 01:04:17.138
Oh, god, it's so sad to hear you

01:04:17.140 --> 01:04:18.873
just nurture this pipe dream.

01:04:18.875 --> 01:04:20.775
"Ma, here's my dream."

01:04:20.777 --> 01:04:23.145
Let it die, honey.

01:04:23.147 --> 01:04:25.213
You know what, Liz?

01:04:25.215 --> 01:04:26.449
This matters to me.

01:04:26.451 --> 01:04:28.318
Even if I'm the only one
who still cares,

01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:29.687
I'm still gonna finish the job

01:04:29.689 --> 01:04:31.922
because we were best friends.

01:04:31.924 --> 01:04:33.825
Well, reality called
looking for you.

01:04:33.827 --> 01:04:35.260
I said you were in the shower,

01:04:35.262 --> 01:04:37.562
but I don't know how much
more time you have,

01:04:37.564 --> 01:04:39.999
you sweet little Vienna sausage.

01:04:40.001 --> 01:04:40.900
All right.

01:04:40.902 --> 01:04:44.137
Well, Liz, I know you mean well.

01:04:45.673 --> 01:04:46.708
Fuck.

01:04:46.710 --> 01:04:49.610
Sorry. It's just...
It's like holding a clam

01:04:49.612 --> 01:04:52.247
that hasn't
been born yet, you know?

01:04:53.784 --> 01:04:56.252
Okay. Go.

01:04:56.821 --> 01:04:58.088
Go!

01:04:58.090 --> 01:05:01.625
I'm kidding. I'm not mad.

01:05:30.796 --> 01:05:33.165
Yo, fuck you.

01:05:35.402 --> 01:05:38.171
I'm talking to a wall.

01:05:42.145 --> 01:05:44.178
Fuck!

01:05:51.122 --> 01:05:52.688
Just because they're
on a skateboard

01:05:52.690 --> 01:05:54.224
doesn't mean
they couldn't be speeding.

01:05:54.226 --> 01:05:57.194
I think it literally means they
couldn't be speeding, but...

01:05:57.196 --> 01:05:59.397
This is the spot, buddy boy.
Is it?

01:05:59.399 --> 01:06:03.369
This is where I bust 'em.
My little secret spot.

01:06:48.227 --> 01:06:50.360
What?

01:06:50.362 --> 01:06:53.131
Why?

01:07:04.011 --> 01:07:05.446
Gram?

01:07:05.448 --> 01:07:08.650
Hey, baby.
Have a cannabis cookie.

01:07:08.652 --> 01:07:12.420
Oh, gram, these are raw.

01:07:12.422 --> 01:07:14.056
Mm.

01:07:14.058 --> 01:07:15.191
Oh.

01:07:15.193 --> 01:07:16.259
Okay, and very strong.

01:07:16.261 --> 01:07:19.897
Um, heh, how many
of those have you had?

01:07:19.899 --> 01:07:23.001
I don't know.
Three? Eleven?

01:07:23.003 --> 01:07:25.204
Okay, gram,

01:07:25.206 --> 01:07:28.207
let's talk about
what's up with the lawn.

01:07:28.209 --> 01:07:31.111
Oh. This handsome
young boy came by

01:07:31.113 --> 01:07:33.280
and he had
all these political signs

01:07:33.282 --> 01:07:36.417
for some woman
that's running for office.

01:07:36.419 --> 01:07:39.755
And guess what her name is.

01:07:39.757 --> 01:07:42.559
Bohner. Heh. Get it?

01:07:44.029 --> 01:07:46.063
I get it. No, I get it.
Bohner.

01:07:46.065 --> 01:07:48.065
Are you sure
that's how you say it?

01:07:48.067 --> 01:07:49.066
Yes. Bohner.

01:07:49.068 --> 01:07:52.504
Now, you know
that heifer got my vote.

01:07:52.506 --> 01:07:53.805
You know it!

01:07:53.807 --> 01:07:55.174
Bohner?

01:07:59.013 --> 01:08:00.147
Yo!

01:08:00.149 --> 01:08:01.582
Don't forget to vote.

01:08:01.584 --> 01:08:03.885
He called me a boner.

01:08:04.587 --> 01:08:07.723
Gram, you are a genius!

01:08:07.857 --> 01:08:10.326
I need to get my Annie back!

01:08:10.827 --> 01:08:12.829
No, honey, I'm a baptist.

01:08:16.602 --> 01:08:19.770
Okay. Okay, here we go.

01:08:19.773 --> 01:08:21.707
Here we go.

01:08:29.251 --> 01:08:30.818
"Do you have a condom, Phil?"

01:08:30.819 --> 01:08:34.823
"Yes, as a matter of fact,
I do know how to put it on."

01:08:34.825 --> 01:08:37.893
"Just don't forget
the reservoir tip."

01:08:37.895 --> 01:08:39.161
What?

01:08:39.162 --> 01:08:40.831
No, that's not right.

01:08:40.832 --> 01:08:42.532
Oh, come on.

01:08:42.533 --> 01:08:45.435
Oh. Heh. Hi.

01:08:46.939 --> 01:08:49.108
Wow. Annie,
you look beautiful.

01:08:49.109 --> 01:08:51.210
Wow, thanks.
You look hot.

01:08:51.212 --> 01:08:53.345
I was just practicing
what to say to you.

01:08:53.348 --> 01:08:55.649
You're ridiculous.
You don't have to do that.

01:08:55.651 --> 01:08:56.883
No? Okay, cool.
No.

01:08:56.885 --> 01:08:59.754
This whip is one of the craziest
things I've ever seen.

01:08:59.756 --> 01:09:01.022
Yeah?
Yeah. I love it.

01:09:01.024 --> 01:09:03.658
It's not how it usually is.
It's a long story.

01:09:03.661 --> 01:09:05.662
Really?
I can't wait to hear it.

01:09:05.663 --> 01:09:07.229
You do? Heh. Okay.

01:09:07.232 --> 01:09:08.231
Great.

01:09:08.233 --> 01:09:10.200
So, uh, where we going?

01:09:10.202 --> 01:09:11.368
We are rolling to the party.

01:09:11.370 --> 01:09:13.537
We just gotta
figure out where it is.

01:09:13.538 --> 01:09:17.008
Yeah, I have... I have
no idea where it's at.

01:09:17.010 --> 01:09:18.144
No?

01:09:18.145 --> 01:09:20.746
Okay, well, you know what?
Fuck the clues.

01:09:20.747 --> 01:09:23.684
We're above the clues.
We'll be smarter than the clues.

01:09:23.685 --> 01:09:25.085
We're gonna rise above
the clues.

01:09:27.390 --> 01:09:28.890
What? Right?
I dig.

01:09:28.892 --> 01:09:30.926
Okay. So we know
there's gonna be

01:09:30.928 --> 01:09:32.560
a lot of booze
at the party, right?

01:09:32.563 --> 01:09:34.831
No doubt.
Why don't you get me the number

01:09:34.832 --> 01:09:36.433
for the biggest
liquor store in town.

01:09:36.435 --> 01:09:38.734
Where's your phone?
It's right here.

01:09:38.737 --> 01:09:41.671
One off top. Here we go.
Okay.

01:09:42.140 --> 01:09:44.343
"One off top."
Like you know it already?

01:09:44.345 --> 01:09:46.078
Yeah, of course.
That's really cool.

01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:47.846
Alcoholic.
It's ringing.

01:09:47.849 --> 01:09:50.049
It's ringing? Okay.

01:09:50.051 --> 01:09:51.518
Okay.

01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:54.822
Uh, hey there. Yeah.

01:09:54.824 --> 01:09:56.491
I'm having a big party tonight

01:09:56.493 --> 01:09:58.093
and my girlfriend
is a dumb bitch

01:09:58.095 --> 01:10:00.229
and she totally doesn't know
the address she gave you.

01:10:00.231 --> 01:10:03.733
It's, like, a big delivery.
Does that ring a bell?

01:10:04.769 --> 01:10:06.970
Oh. Ugh.
He hung up on you?

01:10:06.972 --> 01:10:09.140
Yeah. I don't think
I was slutty enough.

01:10:09.142 --> 01:10:12.578
Okay, I don't think that's what
it was, but if you think so.

01:10:12.580 --> 01:10:14.947
Let me get you another one.
I got you.

01:10:14.949 --> 01:10:16.415
I really think so.

01:10:16.417 --> 01:10:18.084
You know what?
Watch slutty.

01:10:18.086 --> 01:10:19.819
I'm gonna do slutty this time.

01:10:20.589 --> 01:10:22.823
Okay, it's gotta be...

01:10:22.825 --> 01:10:24.826
It's gotta be this one.
Okay.

01:10:24.828 --> 01:10:25.894
It's ringing.

01:10:25.896 --> 01:10:28.663
Oh, my god.
Okay, slutty.

01:10:32.703 --> 01:10:35.606
Hi there, cutie.

01:10:37.676 --> 01:10:38.510
Hi.

01:10:38.512 --> 01:10:41.547
My girlfriends and I are having
a big party tonight

01:10:41.549 --> 01:10:45.819
and we placed
a large order of beer.

01:10:50.559 --> 01:10:51.325
Okay.

01:10:51.327 --> 01:10:55.731
Jessica, you left
your panties in the hot tub.

01:10:55.733 --> 01:11:01.371
Oh, your bra too.
You look amazing naked.

01:11:04.509 --> 01:11:05.476
Oh, you know what?

01:11:05.478 --> 01:11:08.814
This beer talk
is making me so fucking horny.

01:11:08.816 --> 01:11:11.517
Oh, my god.
Oh, I'm so...

01:11:11.519 --> 01:11:13.352
Heh, oh.

01:11:16.825 --> 01:11:19.059
You know what?
That is right.

01:11:19.061 --> 01:11:22.464
Thank you so much.

01:11:22.466 --> 01:11:25.100
You're so handsome.

01:11:25.102 --> 01:11:26.836
Stud.

01:11:27.538 --> 01:11:30.040
You're a genius.
Good looks on calling him stud.

01:11:30.042 --> 01:11:31.141
Thank you.
Oh, my god.

01:11:31.143 --> 01:11:34.145
Maybe I'll call you a stud.
I'd love that. What?

01:11:34.147 --> 01:11:35.112
Right? You like that?

01:11:35.114 --> 01:11:37.249
We rolling? Start the whip.
Yeah, let's go. Okay.

01:11:37.251 --> 01:11:40.119
I've always wanted
to call somebody "baby,"

01:11:40.121 --> 01:11:41.020
but I can't pull it off.

01:11:41.022 --> 01:11:42.989
Okay. Well, let's practice.
Okay.

01:11:42.991 --> 01:11:45.159
Let's go, baby.

01:11:45.161 --> 01:11:46.327
Yeah, I'm chubbin'.

01:11:54.071 --> 01:11:57.474
Seven, eight, nine,

01:11:57.476 --> 01:12:01.513
10, 11, 12, 13, 14!

01:12:02.883 --> 01:12:04.282
Yo, that felt good.
Yeah.

01:12:04.284 --> 01:12:06.151
It's really great
going down the throat.

01:12:06.153 --> 01:12:09.322
Marisa. Oh, my goodness.
Hey. What's up?

01:12:09.324 --> 01:12:11.625
You made it.
Yeah. You made it.

01:12:11.627 --> 01:12:14.061
Wow. Where's Annie?

01:12:14.063 --> 01:12:16.364
Uh...
Annie!

01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:19.868
I don't know.
We got in a fight.

01:12:19.870 --> 01:12:20.769
Oh, my gosh. No.

01:12:20.771 --> 01:12:24.007
I don't know. I feel... yeah.
Tonight? Oh, my gosh.

01:12:24.009 --> 01:12:25.575
Oh, my gosh.
Thank you.

01:12:25.577 --> 01:12:26.377
I'm...

01:12:26.379 --> 01:12:27.711
Okay. You just... you...

01:12:27.713 --> 01:12:31.383
you can't take this stuff
too seriously, you know?

01:12:31.385 --> 01:12:35.688
In the end, it's
all farts and cheeto dust.

01:12:35.690 --> 01:12:37.123
Heh. Okay.

01:12:37.125 --> 01:12:38.659
I like that. Thank you.

01:12:38.661 --> 01:12:40.727
Thank you.
Dap it.

01:12:40.729 --> 01:12:42.462
Yeah.

01:12:43.799 --> 01:12:45.934
I'll see you later.
Okay.

01:12:45.936 --> 01:12:47.503
Okay.

01:12:47.505 --> 01:12:49.438
Okay...

01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:52.642
Let's line them up for Mr. W.
Get in here, boys.

01:12:52.644 --> 01:12:54.778
Come on,
who's hot for teacher, huh?

01:12:54.780 --> 01:12:58.783
Lift this old man up.
I'm feeling rusty.

01:12:58.785 --> 01:13:01.620
All right.
Don't be gentle.

01:13:01.622 --> 01:13:05.358
See? If I just put my, like,
mouth over his thingy,

01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:07.527
and when he puts, like...
So?

01:13:07.529 --> 01:13:09.730
When are you gonna tell
everyone?

01:13:09.732 --> 01:13:10.864
What?

01:13:10.866 --> 01:13:14.402
Stanford. Your mom told me
you got into Stanford.

01:13:14.404 --> 01:13:16.037
When did you talk to my mom?

01:13:16.039 --> 01:13:21.044
Today. I mean, we talk, you
know. I text her and stuff.

01:13:22.947 --> 01:13:24.849
That's a bummer.

01:13:24.851 --> 01:13:27.118
Bummer? No, come on.
Let's get you a drink.

01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:30.155
One more shot,
and you won't feel sad.

01:13:31.358 --> 01:13:33.760
You know, Trent,
I gotta tell you

01:13:33.762 --> 01:13:35.562
I like you clean-shaven.

01:13:35.564 --> 01:13:38.099
Are you flirting with me?
I'm not flirting with you.

01:13:38.101 --> 01:13:41.035
Just giving a compliment.
You look younger and fresher.

01:13:41.037 --> 01:13:43.305
Like a high school kid.
High school?

01:13:43.307 --> 01:13:45.608
Yeah. I mean,
you're just like a teen.

01:13:45.610 --> 01:13:47.143
Like a freshman?

01:13:47.145 --> 01:13:48.678
Maybe not a freshman.
Sophomore.

01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:51.382
Well, I was gonna say...
Sophomore makes sense.

01:13:51.384 --> 01:13:54.986
Like a gargantuan sophomore.
High school. High school.

01:13:54.988 --> 01:13:56.988
Oh, my god. It's...
Right? What do you say?

01:13:56.990 --> 01:14:00.292
It was the worst... was it?
So awesome! It was awesome.

01:14:00.294 --> 01:14:02.229
Okay.
I was king of high school.

01:14:02.231 --> 01:14:03.530
Were you?
The king and the queen.

01:14:03.532 --> 01:14:06.099
How does that work?
I was prom king and queen.

01:14:06.101 --> 01:14:09.070
Four years in a row.
You took yourself to the prom?

01:14:09.072 --> 01:14:12.007
Sure did.
They voted you king and queen?

01:14:12.009 --> 01:14:12.941
Sure did.

01:14:12.943 --> 01:14:15.278
Don't think
they were making fun of you?

01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:16.479
People don't
make fun of me, bud.

01:14:16.481 --> 01:14:20.317
Right. I made most of my friends
in high school playing sports.

01:14:20.319 --> 01:14:22.053
Oh, yeah? What'd you play?
Yeah.

01:14:22.055 --> 01:14:24.423
I was a cross-country runner
and swimming.

01:14:24.425 --> 01:14:27.293
Heh. That's good.
That's funny.

01:14:27.295 --> 01:14:29.328
Running and swimming.
Those aren't sports.

01:14:29.330 --> 01:14:32.266
What are you talking about?
They gotta have a ball.

01:14:32.268 --> 01:14:34.702
Baseball, basketball,
football, tennis,

01:14:34.704 --> 01:14:36.504
soccer, hockey.
That's what I played.

01:14:36.506 --> 01:14:38.106
Hockey's not a ball.
Yes, it is.

01:14:38.108 --> 01:14:41.677
It's a flat ball. It's just
a ball that's been flattened.

01:14:41.679 --> 01:14:43.412
Thanks. What was
your favorite sport?

01:14:43.414 --> 01:14:45.615
Tennis. Loved tennis
more than anything.

01:14:45.617 --> 01:14:47.050
Really?
That surprises me.

01:14:47.052 --> 01:14:50.922
Yeah, tore my rotator cuff.
Oh, that's too bad.

01:14:50.924 --> 01:14:52.323
Hey...
hm?

01:14:52.325 --> 01:14:54.159
Shit happens, man.

01:14:54.161 --> 01:14:56.295
What did you just say?

01:14:56.297 --> 01:14:59.032
Shit happens.
Like, life happens.

01:14:59.034 --> 01:15:00.133
There's ups and downs, and...

01:15:00.135 --> 01:15:03.003
Shit doesn't happen to me, okay?
No?

01:15:03.005 --> 01:15:04.605
Not anymore.

01:15:04.607 --> 01:15:05.774
Okay.
Oh, look at this.

01:15:05.776 --> 01:15:07.609
We got one.
We got one. Here we go.

01:15:07.611 --> 01:15:10.279
That's a real one.
It's a real one.

01:15:10.281 --> 01:15:11.481
Yes! Yes!

01:15:11.483 --> 01:15:13.984
You are so excited.

01:15:13.986 --> 01:15:15.219
Light 'em up!

01:15:15.221 --> 01:15:17.121
He he he!

01:15:17.123 --> 01:15:19.791
Boy, I'm glad we are going
to this party together.

01:15:19.793 --> 01:15:22.061
And you and I are gonna
always have this

01:15:22.063 --> 01:15:23.829
to share
with each other. God.

01:15:23.831 --> 01:15:25.131
Beautiful.
Man...

01:15:25.133 --> 01:15:26.967
Hey, just so you know,
I broke my hymen

01:15:26.969 --> 01:15:28.568
in fourth grade riding a horse.

01:15:28.570 --> 01:15:30.605
Huh?

01:15:30.607 --> 01:15:32.473
- Oh! Annie, Annie.
- What? What?

01:15:32.475 --> 01:15:34.309
- You're getting pulled over.
- What? No.

01:15:34.311 --> 01:15:36.678
You're going really fast.
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

01:15:36.680 --> 01:15:37.913
We have to go faster.
What?

01:15:37.915 --> 01:15:39.249
No. Pull over.
We have to go faster.

01:15:39.251 --> 01:15:41.618
Annie, you have to pull over.
Sorry, Phil.

01:15:41.620 --> 01:15:42.853
We gotta get to the party.

01:15:45.024 --> 01:15:46.323
Is this how fast
you normally go?

01:15:46.325 --> 01:15:48.927
I usually go double this speed.
Please don't.

01:15:48.929 --> 01:15:50.930
Don't even go any more...
Do or don't?

01:15:50.932 --> 01:15:53.132
Please don't, Trent.
Come on, man...

01:15:53.134 --> 01:15:55.702
Oh, come on! No!

01:15:55.704 --> 01:15:59.474
I wanna be a lawyer. Jesus.
Yeah, buddy!

01:16:08.152 --> 01:16:11.321
Oh, my god. Shit. Slam it.
Best day of our lives.

01:16:11.323 --> 01:16:13.090
Slam it. Go!
Best day of our lives!

01:16:13.092 --> 01:16:15.893
Best day of our lives.
Okay, okay, okay.

01:16:16.362 --> 01:16:18.463
We're gonna get
this big Barney vehicle.

01:16:18.465 --> 01:16:20.667
What do you think
about this? This is easy.

01:16:20.669 --> 01:16:23.269
"Barney vehicle"?
Barney. It's a deep purple.

01:16:23.271 --> 01:16:26.173
That's not purple. That's a...
That's a magenta, right?

01:16:26.175 --> 01:16:28.442
That is for sure a fuchsia.
That's not a fuchsia.

01:16:28.444 --> 01:16:31.012
Yes, it is. If anything,
it's closer to plum.

01:16:31.014 --> 01:16:33.716
What? Are you insane?
Maybe like a pre-ripe plum.

01:16:33.718 --> 01:16:35.551
Maybe chartreuse, if anything.

01:16:35.553 --> 01:16:36.853
I think you don't know
your colors.

01:16:36.855 --> 01:16:39.389
You don't know your colors.
I know my colors!

01:16:39.391 --> 01:16:41.659
No disrespect.
I doubt that you do know

01:16:41.661 --> 01:16:43.461
your full range
of colors, Trent.

01:16:50.605 --> 01:16:52.305
Uh-uh.
Nothing from you.

01:16:52.307 --> 01:16:55.476
Have you seen Annie?
Because I can't find her.

01:16:55.478 --> 01:16:56.644
No. Why?

01:16:56.646 --> 01:16:58.447
Don't act like you give a shit.

01:16:58.449 --> 01:17:02.051
Whoa. Okay. I have
a rape whistle in my vagina.

01:17:02.053 --> 01:17:03.086
I'll use it.

01:17:03.088 --> 01:17:05.989
- I am done with your bullshit.
- What bullshit?

01:17:05.991 --> 01:17:07.558
You blaming me
for what happened.

01:17:07.560 --> 01:17:10.462
I need you to be a little bit
more specific.

01:17:10.464 --> 01:17:12.564
When you left town, Marisa,
you abandoned us,

01:17:12.566 --> 01:17:15.601
and you were so sure
I was gonna become everything

01:17:15.603 --> 01:17:16.769
that you hated about this town,

01:17:16.771 --> 01:17:19.373
but that's
what you turned me into.

01:17:19.375 --> 01:17:20.607
You turned me into this,

01:17:20.609 --> 01:17:23.244
this bullshit high-school
stereotype.

01:17:23.246 --> 01:17:26.681
I didn't create this mess
with Annie, Marisa. You did.

01:17:26.683 --> 01:17:28.317
Okay.
And fuck you, by the way

01:17:28.319 --> 01:17:29.652
for assuming
that I wouldn't be there

01:17:29.654 --> 01:17:33.256
for you when you were gone.
Whoa...

01:17:34.459 --> 01:17:35.927
you love acting
like this friendship

01:17:35.929 --> 01:17:39.397
has never mattered
to me, Marisa, but it did.

01:17:43.236 --> 01:17:44.370
Are you done?

01:17:44.372 --> 01:17:46.873
I am not this perfect thing
that you think I am.

01:17:46.875 --> 01:17:49.743
I am the same person
that I have always been.

01:17:49.745 --> 01:17:53.648
I didn't change
just because you left town.

01:17:56.520 --> 01:18:00.156
Shit. The cops.

01:18:05.265 --> 01:18:07.765
- Gotta go to the party.
- Fuck. Go.

01:18:07.767 --> 01:18:10.069
Where's that house?
We'll have so much fun. Yes!

01:18:10.071 --> 01:18:11.303
Oh, my god!

01:18:11.305 --> 01:18:13.807
Oh, my god!
Yo, they're shooting at us.

01:18:13.809 --> 01:18:15.475
They're shooting at us!
What?

01:18:15.477 --> 01:18:19.313
What the fuck? Annie, Annie!
Watch out! Watch out!

01:18:19.315 --> 01:18:21.817
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god! Annie!

01:18:21.819 --> 01:18:23.218
Oh, my god!

01:18:23.821 --> 01:18:25.722
Oh, my god, the beeramyd!

01:18:42.977 --> 01:18:45.812
Holy shit.

01:19:13.882 --> 01:19:16.618
Yes, queen! Heh!

01:19:16.620 --> 01:19:19.788
That's my, my best friend.

01:19:21.224 --> 01:19:25.028
Annie, I'm so proud of you,
dude. Did you get some dick?

01:19:25.129 --> 01:19:26.663
Hey, what's up, Phil?

01:19:26.665 --> 01:19:28.866
You're hilarious. Hi.
Hey.

01:19:28.868 --> 01:19:30.134
Hey, I'm sorry.
I love you.

01:19:30.136 --> 01:19:31.836
I love you more.
I love you the most.

01:19:31.838 --> 01:19:34.273
I love you so much.
I love you the mostest.

01:19:34.275 --> 01:19:35.808
Okay. Cool.
Okay.

01:19:35.810 --> 01:19:37.143
Kelly.

01:19:37.145 --> 01:19:39.546
I'm feeling very confident,

01:19:39.548 --> 01:19:41.949
and I request your presence.

01:19:41.951 --> 01:19:44.385
Come over here, please.

01:19:48.157 --> 01:19:50.493
I gotta pee.
No, you don't gotta pee.

01:19:50.495 --> 01:19:53.797
You're staying.
You're waiting right here.

01:19:53.799 --> 01:19:55.332
I love you guys so much.

01:19:55.334 --> 01:19:57.267
I love you more than anything.

01:19:57.269 --> 01:19:59.003
You're my best friends.

01:19:59.005 --> 01:20:01.339
There's only one way to do this.

01:20:01.341 --> 01:20:03.542
We gotta do a group hug.

01:20:04.578 --> 01:20:06.880
We gotta do a group hug.
We got to.

01:20:06.882 --> 01:20:08.315
Yes.

01:20:09.484 --> 01:20:11.953
Aw.
Shut the fuck up!

01:20:11.955 --> 01:20:16.125
Enough emotional shit!

01:20:26.539 --> 01:20:29.241
Look who we have here.

01:20:29.243 --> 01:20:32.378
Oh, busted. Busted!

01:20:41.357 --> 01:20:42.590
Andy.

01:20:42.592 --> 01:20:44.393
Over here.
Move, you basic bitches.

01:20:44.395 --> 01:20:46.629
I'm coming.
Don't start without me.

01:20:46.631 --> 01:20:48.031
Ah! Ah! Ah!

01:20:48.033 --> 01:20:48.932
Congrats, bitches.

01:20:48.934 --> 01:20:52.170
You just got front row seats
to 23 jump street.

01:20:52.172 --> 01:20:54.939
Put your gun down.
Okay.

01:20:54.941 --> 01:20:56.007
Ladies, you're busted.

01:20:56.009 --> 01:20:57.876
I'm gonna write you a ticket
for, let's see,

01:20:57.878 --> 01:21:01.347
public intoxication,
underage drinking,

01:21:01.349 --> 01:21:02.982
drinking in public...

01:21:02.984 --> 01:21:06.020
Um, excuse me.

01:21:07.856 --> 01:21:09.224
Well, well, well.

01:21:09.226 --> 01:21:10.992
Hello, Sarah.
What are you doing here?

01:21:10.994 --> 01:21:13.663
- What am I doing here?
- What are you doing here

01:21:13.665 --> 01:21:16.866
partying with all these losers?

01:21:16.868 --> 01:21:19.703
I'm actually house-sitting
for Councilwoman Bohner.

01:21:19.705 --> 01:21:21.272
Councilwoman Bohner?

01:21:21.274 --> 01:21:23.208
Boner. I have that
sometimes.

01:21:23.210 --> 01:21:24.943
Andy.
I could call her

01:21:24.945 --> 01:21:26.679
if you want.
She knows all about the party.

01:21:26.681 --> 01:21:29.481
I didn't know if you wanted
to start on a sour note

01:21:29.483 --> 01:21:32.385
with a newly-minted city
bureaucrat.

01:21:32.387 --> 01:21:33.653
Ooh.

01:21:33.655 --> 01:21:35.890
- Burn!
- Enough. That's enough!

01:21:35.892 --> 01:21:38.260
You're still getting a ticket.
You're still all...

01:21:38.262 --> 01:21:43.333
you will be arresting
nobody here, Trent.

01:21:45.302 --> 01:21:47.304
You got a lot
of nerve coming here.

01:21:47.306 --> 01:21:48.772
First, you steal my gal,

01:21:48.774 --> 01:21:51.876
then you shit in the jacuzzi
at the graduation party.

01:21:51.878 --> 01:21:54.379
That's not true.
None of that is true.

01:21:54.381 --> 01:21:56.449
I never shit in the jacuzzi.

01:21:56.451 --> 01:21:58.718
You know, I used
to wanna be you.

01:21:58.720 --> 01:21:59.820
I did.

01:21:59.822 --> 01:22:02.623
But now I got you figured out.

01:22:02.625 --> 01:22:04.459
You, sir, suck.

01:22:04.461 --> 01:22:06.995
What did you just say?
You suck.

01:22:06.997 --> 01:22:09.765
Oh, no. He did not.
Yes, he did.

01:22:09.767 --> 01:22:11.401
You suck!

01:22:11.403 --> 01:22:12.702
You suck!

01:22:12.704 --> 01:22:13.937
He doesn't suck.
He gets sucked.

01:22:13.939 --> 01:22:15.539
I get sucked.
You suck!

01:22:15.541 --> 01:22:18.943
No. I get sucked. I get sucked.
You suck! You suck!

01:22:18.945 --> 01:22:20.345
He gets sucked.
Stop it.

01:22:20.347 --> 01:22:22.080
Stop it now!
You suck! You suck!

01:22:22.082 --> 01:22:24.550
No! I'm an officer of the law!
You suck! You suck!

01:22:24.552 --> 01:22:27.387
You're all going to jail!
You're going to jail.

01:22:27.389 --> 01:22:29.790
I'm gonna get backup.
We'll shoot all of you guys.

01:22:29.792 --> 01:22:31.892
You suck! You suck! You suck!
Andy!

01:22:31.894 --> 01:22:33.828
Oh, my god.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:22:39.136 --> 01:22:41.905
He's a dumb-ass.
Yeah!

01:22:42.473 --> 01:22:44.641
- Let's go, girls.
- I'm down. What's up?

01:22:44.643 --> 01:22:46.978
Oh, my god. All of us.

01:22:57.091 --> 01:23:01.630
Guys, this is the best night
I've had in such a long time.

01:23:01.632 --> 01:23:04.900
We're back.
We're the three amigos.

01:23:04.902 --> 01:23:06.903
You mean TLC.

01:23:06.905 --> 01:23:09.840
I should probably apologize.

01:23:10.008 --> 01:23:13.310
Just for all the shit
that went down when I left.

01:23:13.312 --> 01:23:16.848
No. I get it.
I would've hated me too.

01:23:16.850 --> 01:23:18.684
Shut up, you guys.

01:23:18.686 --> 01:23:21.153
Let's just enjoy this.

01:23:32.536 --> 01:23:33.836
All right.

01:23:33.838 --> 01:23:35.305
Let's do this.

01:23:35.307 --> 01:23:37.006
Phil and I gotta fuck.

01:23:37.008 --> 01:23:39.243
Oh, my god.
