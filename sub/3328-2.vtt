WEBVTT

00:02.070 --> 00:04.698
Give me everything you got! Now!

00:04.730 --> 00:07.597
Are you deaf?!

00:10.670 --> 00:12.103
Come on!

00:12.140 --> 00:14.199
Please, I don't want
any trouble.

00:14.680 --> 00:16.204
(grunts)

00:28.420 --> 00:29.626
(gunshot)

00:32.160 --> 00:34.151
(two gunshots)

00:39.240 --> 00:40.298
(panﬁng)

00:40.340 --> 00:41.466
Please!

00:41.500 --> 00:43.707
I don't want any trouble!

00:51.310 --> 00:53.471
(birds chirping)

00:55.850 --> 00:58.080
MAN:
Dr. Watson?

00:59.460 --> 01:01.519
Joey!
(laughs):
Hey-hey!

01:01.560 --> 01:02.652
Hi.

01:02.690 --> 01:04.681
Long time.
Been a while, huh?

01:04.730 --> 01:06.789
Yeah. What, three years?
Yeah.

01:06.830 --> 01:08.718
Uh, you remembered
Dad's birthday.

01:08.760 --> 01:11.160
Well, a day
late, but yeah.

01:11.200 --> 01:12.633
Hmm.
(laughs):
You caught me.

01:12.670 --> 01:15.195
Mm. Nice thing about
coming the day after,

01:15.240 --> 01:18.209
you're less likely
to run into my mom.

01:20.580 --> 01:22.548
It's nice of you...

01:22.580 --> 01:25.105
to come and see him.

01:25.150 --> 01:27.118
I liked him.

01:27.150 --> 01:29.482
He was a good man.

01:31.490 --> 01:33.481
You're a good doctor.

01:45.830 --> 01:48.799
Hey, let me buy you a
coffee; we can catch up.

01:48.840 --> 01:51.559
I'm supposed to meet
a friend I work with, so...

01:51.610 --> 01:53.134
Come on, just one cup.

01:56.780 --> 01:59.169
BELL: Well, I think
we're wrapped up here.

01:59.220 --> 02:00.676
Why don't we make
one more sweep,

02:00.720 --> 02:02.483
make sure we got pictures.

02:02.520 --> 02:04.579
And then police have been
stationed at the hospital.

02:04.620 --> 02:06.759
In case Benny wakes up,
somebody from the team...

02:06.790 --> 02:08.758
Detective Bell.
Sorry I'm late.

02:08.790 --> 02:11.452
You're not late-- you texted me
and said you heard

02:11.490 --> 02:12.889
on your scanner
there'd been a shooting.

02:12.930 --> 02:15.228
I texted you back, told you
I didn't need any help.

02:15.260 --> 02:17.364
Actually, you wrote,
and I quote:

02:17.400 --> 02:18.867
"Yes, please, now,

02:18.900 --> 02:21.596
triple-smiley face,
with tongue protruding."
What?

02:21.640 --> 02:23.505
(scoffs) Yeah, see,
that's not from me.

02:23.540 --> 02:26.236
That's from someone named Bella,
and you got it last December.

02:26.280 --> 02:27.736
My name is Bell,

02:27.780 --> 02:30.271
no "A," but I can see how
you might've confused us.

02:30.310 --> 02:33.245
It's not like you're
into details or anything.
How embarrassing.

02:33.280 --> 02:35.271
Aanay, now that I'm here...

02:37.820 --> 02:39.412
Vic's name is Felix Soto.

02:39.460 --> 02:40.882
He's a math tutor.

02:40.920 --> 02:42.751
Lives here alone.

02:42.790 --> 02:43.859
(smacks lips)

02:46.330 --> 02:49.493
I was under the impression
that two men had been shot.

02:49.530 --> 02:52.260
Two were. Second victim,
guy named Benny Charles,

02:52.300 --> 02:55.792
was shot in the driveway
right out there.

02:55.840 --> 02:57.967
Funny thing is,
far as we can tell,

02:58.010 --> 03:00.376
they didn't know each other.
About 90 seconds

03:00.410 --> 03:02.344
before Mr. Charles
got shot last night,

03:02.380 --> 03:04.405
he mugged someone
around the corner.

03:04.450 --> 03:07.942
I think he ducked into the
driveway to count his loot.

03:07.980 --> 03:10.312
Wrong place, wrong time?

03:10.350 --> 03:12.250
Well... _
unless you believe

03:12.290 --> 03:14.383
in karma.
Yeah.

03:14.420 --> 03:16.854
So I'm assuming, from the
absence of his body,

03:16.890 --> 03:18.949
that Mr._ Charles
survwed.
Barely.

03:18.990 --> 03:22.289
First officers on the scene
managed to stop the bleeding,

03:22.330 --> 03:23.968
_ but he never
regained conscrousness.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.627
He's in surgery now.

03:25.670 --> 03:27.865
I'm hearing it
doesn't look good.

03:27.900 --> 03:31.461
Hey, where's your better
half this morning?

03:31.510 --> 03:34.638
One mystery at a time,
Detective. So...

03:34.680 --> 03:38.343
not much evidence to
suggest It was a robbery

03:38.380 --> 03:41.440
gone wrong-- too many
valuables have been left behind.

03:41.480 --> 03:43.448
A neighbor heard Mr. Soto
arguing with another man

03:43.490 --> 03:46.311
a few nights ago, but never
got a good look at the guy.

03:46.360 --> 03:48.681
We're reaching out to his
family, see if they can think

03:48.720 --> 03:50.529
of anyone who had
beef with him.

03:51.890 --> 03:53.858
Interesting space, huh?

03:53.900 --> 03:55.527
Minimalist.

03:55.560 --> 03:56.959
The other rooms aren't.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.968
There's art and
pictures hung up.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.467
I wondered for a second

04:00.500 --> 04:02.832
if maybe the shooter
took some down, but...

04:02.870 --> 04:04.701
aren't any nail holes.

04:04.740 --> 04:06.332
(chuckles)

04:06.380 --> 04:08.371
You always been this observant?

04:10.450 --> 04:11.872
I'm asking that quite sincerely.

04:11.910 --> 04:14.743
I was wondering if exposure
to my methods had...

04:14.780 --> 04:16.486
helped you in any way.

04:16.520 --> 04:18.715
Actually, before
you came along,

04:18.750 --> 04:20.559
I'd never closed
a case before.

04:20.590 --> 04:22.353
Neither had the rest
of the department.

04:22.390 --> 04:24.620
Most of us were thinking
of packing up, leaving,

04:24.660 --> 04:26.457
letting the city
fend for itself.

04:27.800 --> 04:29.688
We need to find
the black light.

04:29.730 --> 04:31.027
The what?

04:31.070 --> 04:33.368
There's a chemical known
as C.A.M. phosphor

04:33.400 --> 04:35.459
on the walls--
smells like spent matchsticks.

04:35.500 --> 04:37.707
Smell it. Smell it.

04:37.740 --> 04:39.037
It's the primary ingredient

04:39.070 --> 04:41.732
of an ink which
can only be seen

04:41.780 --> 04:42.940
when exposed to...

04:44.380 --> 04:46.541
...when it exposed to...

04:48.550 --> 04:50.745
...ultraviolet light.

04:50.790 --> 04:52.610
Hmm?

04:52.660 --> 04:53.809
Oh.

04:56.020 --> 04:57.419
Thank you.

05:05.430 --> 05:07.591
BELL:
What is it?

05:07.640 --> 05:09.528
Well, I'm going
to take a very literal

05:09.570 --> 05:13.404
stab in the dark and say...
maths.

05:13.440 --> 05:14.998
Question is...

05:15.040 --> 05:19.044
does it have anything to do
with Mr. Soto's death?

05:57.690 --> 05:58.918
JOEY: Still can't believe
you're a cop.

05:58.950 --> 06:00.588
I-I'm not a cop.

06:00.620 --> 06:02.053
I'm a consulting... Yeah.
A consulting detective.

06:02.090 --> 06:04.820
Still, you, like,
go to crime scenes

06:04.860 --> 06:06.828
and put away bad guys.
Well, it's a little more

06:06.860 --> 06:07.929
complicated than
that, but yeah.

06:07.960 --> 06:09.666
Well, sometimes
we do. Um...
(laughs)

06:09.700 --> 06:10.997
What about you?

06:11.030 --> 06:12.588
You're graduating
this year, right?

06:14.100 --> 06:15.692
Uh... I don't know.

06:15.740 --> 06:19.699
I, um... had a kind of
rough time junior year.

06:19.740 --> 06:22.038
I was thinking
about my dad a lot.

06:22.080 --> 06:25.072
(chuckles): Probably partying
a little more than I should've.

06:25.110 --> 06:28.079
Actually, um, I left...

06:28.120 --> 06:31.544
right before
my spring semester.

06:31.590 --> 06:32.852
Oh.
Yeah.

06:32.890 --> 06:34.551
I'm sorry to hear that.

06:34.590 --> 06:36.182
It is what it is, right?

06:36.220 --> 06:38.825
Besides, I got
some stuff going on,

06:38.860 --> 06:40.828
stuff I'm very
excited about.
Yeah?

06:40.860 --> 06:43.499
This is my bar.

06:43.530 --> 06:44.724
You bought a bar?

06:44.770 --> 06:45.794
Well, I'm about
to buy a bar,

06:45.830 --> 06:46.797
me and a buddy.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.159
And, you know, we're just

06:48.200 --> 06:50.009
getting together
the funding right now,

06:50.040 --> 06:52.099
but we are this close, Doc.

06:52.140 --> 06:54.438
Oh. Joan. You should
call me Joan now.

06:54.480 --> 06:55.708
Ah, sorry.

06:55.740 --> 06:58.447
Old habits. (laughs)

07:00.550 --> 07:01.744
You don't like it?

07:01.780 --> 07:03.179
No. It's just...

07:03.220 --> 07:05.211
I just remember how
excited you were

07:05.250 --> 07:07.059
about studying to
become an engineer,

07:07.090 --> 07:09.558
how happy it
made your dad.
Mm.

07:09.590 --> 07:12.457
Well, the school
took away my scholarship

07:12.500 --> 07:14.456
when I dropped out, so...

07:14.500 --> 07:16.968
so without that,
can't exactly go back.

07:17.000 --> 07:17.989
(chuckles)

07:18.030 --> 07:19.736
Yeah.

07:21.740 --> 07:24.106
It's funny, it's like
I can't help wondering

07:24.140 --> 07:27.234
if we were supposed to run
into each other this morning.

07:27.280 --> 07:28.804
My partner and me,

07:28.840 --> 07:30.478
we have big plans
for this place,

07:30.510 --> 07:32.717
and I know that anyone
that invests with us

07:32.750 --> 07:34.570
is gonna double their money.

07:34.620 --> 07:35.973
Like, at least.

07:36.020 --> 07:39.478
Are you asking me
for a loan?

07:39.520 --> 07:42.114
No, I'm-I'm offering you
an opportunity.

07:42.160 --> 07:44.549
And you were always
so good to me.

07:44.590 --> 07:46.990
You know?
You... you held my hand

07:47.030 --> 07:49.828
when Dad got sick.

07:49.870 --> 07:52.964
Now I just, you know, maybe
I can pay you back a little.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.230
Hey, I even
found this little

07:55.270 --> 07:58.967
spot in the back room
to hang his picture.

07:59.010 --> 08:01.934
You know, just so he can
always be there, always.

08:04.910 --> 08:07.674
So, how much do you need?

08:22.800 --> 08:25.268
If you're looking for Sherlock,
he's downstairs.

08:25.300 --> 08:27.962
Okay.

08:31.710 --> 08:33.678
I will go there now.

08:37.710 --> 08:39.974
HOLMES:
His name is Harlan Emple.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.817
He is the
Rachel P. Hanson Professor

08:41.850 --> 08:43.545
for Applied Mathematics
at Columbia University,

08:43.590 --> 08:45.615
and holder of the
Smithfield Endowed Chair

08:45.650 --> 08:47.208
of Algebraic Geometry
at the Huntington Institute.

08:47.260 --> 08:49.649
And he is here to help
you make sense

08:49.690 --> 08:51.829
of the equations you found.
Okay, I get that.

08:51.860 --> 08:55.091
What I don't get is
why he isn't wearing a shirt.

08:55.130 --> 08:56.768
Every great thinker
has a process, Watson.

08:56.800 --> 08:58.267
In Harlan's case,
he doesn't like anything

08:58.300 --> 09:00.063
to come between him
and the numbers.

09:00.100 --> 09:01.988
I know you can feel quite
Victorian about such matters,

09:02.040 --> 09:03.928
so I've given him a
little bell to ring

09:03.970 --> 09:06.871
should he feel the need
to disrobe entirely.

09:06.910 --> 09:08.138
Having said that,
I can't guarantee

09:08.180 --> 09:09.647
he won't sit on
the furniture.

09:09.680 --> 09:10.874
How do you know him again?

09:10.910 --> 09:13.344
In 1999, he devised
a mathematical model

09:13.380 --> 09:15.314
which he believed
could accurately predict

09:15.350 --> 09:17.739
crime patterns
in and around New York City.

09:17.790 --> 09:19.143
Ultimately, didn't work,

09:19.190 --> 09:20.782
but I found the premise
quite fascinating.

09:20.820 --> 09:22.924
We've been corresponding
ever since.

09:22.960 --> 09:24.655
Do you really think this guy

09:24.690 --> 09:26.954
was killed over math?
Mr. Soto obviously went

09:27.000 --> 09:29.321
to great lengths
to conceal his calculations.

09:29.360 --> 09:31.089
Whether they have
any real value,

09:31.130 --> 09:32.939
or are just
the numerical ramblings

09:32.970 --> 09:35.962
of a math-obsessed madman,
is for Harlan to determine.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.206
Eggs?

09:37.240 --> 09:39.231
Uh, no, thanks.

09:41.280 --> 09:44.249
Hey, I was wondering
if it was possible

09:44.280 --> 09:46.339
to get an advance
on my salary.

09:46.380 --> 09:48.814
Define "advance."

09:48.850 --> 09:50.613
$5,000.

09:51.720 --> 09:53.688
I ran into someone this morning.

09:53.720 --> 09:55.779
He's the son
of an old friend of mine.

09:55.820 --> 09:57.856
He's trying to get
this business off the ground.

09:57.890 --> 09:59.084
I thought I'd help him out.

09:59.130 --> 10:01.223
I just maxed out
on my IRA contributions,

10:01.260 --> 10:03.069
so I cannot take money back,

10:03.100 --> 10:05.364
otherwise I will get
massive penalties.

10:05.400 --> 10:08.836
You must really believe
in this young man.

10:08.870 --> 10:13.000
Well, I'd like to see him
take a shot at this.

10:13.040 --> 10:14.268
Not quite the same thing,
though, is it?

10:14.310 --> 10:16.847
HARLAN: Sherlock! I know
what the formula is!

10:16.880 --> 10:18.745
And it is a doozy.

10:18.780 --> 10:20.372
Okay, so the first thing
you need to know

10:20.420 --> 10:22.274
is that the guy who
wrote this was a genius.

10:22.320 --> 10:24.015
Guys with an "S."

10:24.050 --> 10:26.018
There were two
mathematicians at work here.

10:26.050 --> 10:27.415
One was Felix Soto.

10:27.460 --> 10:29.724
These parts of the equation
are a match

10:29.760 --> 10:31.853
for handwriting samples
I took from his home.

10:31.890 --> 10:33.858
These scribbles are
from another man

10:33.900 --> 10:34.958
yet to be identified.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.888
How-how do you know
it was a man?

10:36.930 --> 10:39.091
There is an inconsistency
to the gradient here.

10:39.130 --> 10:41.860
Some of the letters
slant to the right,
others to the left.

10:41.900 --> 10:43.765
Also, the stem
of the "P" here

10:43.810 --> 10:47.007
and the "D" here are looped
instead of doubled back.

10:47.040 --> 10:48.837
It doesn't guarantee
the writer was male,

10:48.880 --> 10:50.302
but it's a strong indicator.

10:50.350 --> 10:53.171
Fine. Then these guys
are geniuses.

10:53.220 --> 10:55.142
The point is, I know
what they were working on.

10:55.180 --> 10:57.444
It's P versus NP!

10:57.490 --> 11:00.459
Come on, it's one of the most
famous problems in math history.

11:00.490 --> 11:01.912
Harlan, if we were
mathematicians,

11:01.960 --> 11:03.325
you would not be here.

11:03.360 --> 11:06.056
In simplest terms, P versus NP
asks if every problem

11:06.090 --> 11:08.797
whose solution can be quickly
verified by a computer can also

11:08.830 --> 11:11.128
be quickly solved
by a computer.

11:11.170 --> 11:12.865
Sounds innocent enough, right?
Only it's not.

11:12.900 --> 11:14.390
It is filthy.

11:14.440 --> 11:16.738
Some experts have even theorized
that it can't be solved.

11:16.770 --> 11:19.876
Could it be a motive
for murder?
That depends.

11:19.910 --> 11:22.470
You think a million dollars
could be a motive for murder?

11:22.510 --> 11:24.102
I'm sorry. You're saying
this is worth a million dollars?

11:24.150 --> 11:25.469
No, but it is getting there.

11:25.510 --> 11:27.114
I mean, this is the farthest

11:27.150 --> 11:29.414
I have ever seen anyone
take P versus NP.

11:29.450 --> 11:31.748
I mean, if I... ifI had
to guess, I would say

11:31.790 --> 11:33.758
that these guys are months,
maybe weeks from solving it.

11:33.790 --> 11:35.155
But who would pay
a million dollars

11:35.190 --> 11:37.249
for the solution to a
mathematical problem?

11:37.290 --> 11:39.224
The Clay Mathematics Institute
in Rhode Island.

11:39.260 --> 11:41.899
They're a non-profit dedicated
to promoting math interest.

11:41.930 --> 11:43.295
But the thing
that they are most famous for

11:43.330 --> 11:44.968
is The Millennium Prizes.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.161
They offer a million dollars
to anyone who can solve

11:47.200 --> 11:50.033
just one of the seven hardest
problems in the world.

11:50.070 --> 11:52.231
And P versus NP
is one of the seven.

11:52.270 --> 11:55.376
We know that the dead man, Soto,
was working with a partner.

11:55.410 --> 11:57.048
And you said that Soto's
neighbor heard him arguing

11:57.080 --> 11:58.240
with another man
a few nights ago.

11:58.280 --> 12:00.009
Perhaps the partner thought

12:00.050 --> 12:01.847
he could complete
the problem himself.

12:01.880 --> 12:04.041
Take the prize money
without having to share it.

12:04.090 --> 12:05.341
For what it's worth,

12:05.390 --> 12:06.914
your victim would not
have been working

12:06.960 --> 12:08.450
with just any mathematician.

12:08.490 --> 12:10.754
P versus NP
is the kind of problem

12:10.790 --> 12:12.121
that people devote
their lives to.

12:12.160 --> 12:14.253
There is a whole _
P versus NP community.

12:14.300 --> 12:16.393
A community which you could
help us gain access to?

12:16.430 --> 12:17.920
Well, I sort of travel

12:17.970 --> 12:19.392
in different
mathematical circles.

12:19.430 --> 12:21.432
But I do know somebody
who's pretty involved.

12:21.470 --> 12:23.802
Tanya Barrett. She's a professor
at Triboro College.

12:23.840 --> 12:25.262
TANYA:
I heard about what happened

12:25.310 --> 12:26.777
to Felix on the news
this morning.

12:26.810 --> 12:28.107
I still can't believe it.

12:28.140 --> 12:29.505
Were you two close?

12:29.540 --> 12:31.440
I met him when I
wrote my articles,

12:31.480 --> 12:33.414
but that was
years ago.

12:33.450 --> 12:36.317
It's our understanding,
Professor Barrett,

12:36.350 --> 12:38.489
that you are a veritable
who's who guide

12:38.520 --> 12:40.511
to the world
of P versus NP.

12:40.560 --> 12:42.152
When I wrote my articles,

12:42.190 --> 12:43.919
I profiled
all the mathematicians

12:43.960 --> 12:46.019
who had really devoted
themselves to the problem.

12:46.060 --> 12:47.789
That's how
I met Felix.

12:47.830 --> 12:49.252
Do you know if he was close

12:49.300 --> 12:50.995
to any of the other people
that you interviewed?

12:51.030 --> 12:52.520
I don't think so. Why?

12:52.570 --> 12:54.788
We have reason to believe
that before he died,

12:54.840 --> 12:56.091
he was collaborating
with a partner.

12:56.140 --> 12:57.402
That doesn't
sound like Felix.

12:57.440 --> 12:59.328
He was very competitive.

12:59.370 --> 13:00.871
But I'll be
happy to walk you

13:00.910 --> 13:02.332
through the names
that I do have.

13:02.380 --> 13:05.577
These are the journals
that published me.

13:05.610 --> 13:08.010
So, um, what made
you start wanting

13:08.050 --> 13:09.881
to write about P versus NP?

13:09.920 --> 13:11.319
Oh, when I was young

13:11.350 --> 13:14.888
and very full of myself,
I decided to spend a summer

13:14.920 --> 13:16.319
trying to solve it.

13:16.360 --> 13:18.487
When I looked up,
three years had gone by.

13:18.530 --> 13:22.057
P versus NP may well be
unsolvable.

13:22.100 --> 13:25.490
So... I walked away.

13:25.530 --> 13:27.430
Do you know
who wrote this proof?

13:27.470 --> 13:29.597
CynlNauen
a total savant.

13:29.640 --> 13:31.961
He lives in Brooklyn.
Look familiar?

13:32.010 --> 13:35.104
That's the same handwriting
as our mystery mathematician.

13:35.140 --> 13:37.370
You wouldn't happen to have a
picture of Mr. Nauer, would you?

13:37.410 --> 13:39.378
WATSON:
Cyril Nauer looks
like the Unabomber.

13:39.410 --> 13:40.843
HOLMES:
Both are mathematicians,

13:40.880 --> 13:42.518
both are loners.

13:42.550 --> 13:44.939
Let's hope only one of them
ever aspired to mass casualties.

13:44.990 --> 13:48.209
Detective Bell, I believe
we may have a strong suspect

13:48.260 --> 13:49.852
in the murder
of Felix Soto.

13:49.890 --> 13:51.255
That's good.

13:51.290 --> 13:53.099
I just found out
we got a second victim.

13:53.130 --> 13:55.496
He was shot on a sidewalk
in Hell's Kitchen

13:55.530 --> 13:57.862
last night,
dragged into an alley.

13:57.900 --> 13:59.629
Initial ballistics report says

13:59.670 --> 14:02.491
it was the same gun
that killed Felix Soto.

14:02.540 --> 14:04.360
Any connection
between the two men?

14:04.410 --> 14:06.366
Right now,
all I have is a name.

14:06.410 --> 14:09.402
CynlNauen

14:09.440 --> 14:12.603
So, want to give me the name
of your suspect?

14:24.530 --> 14:27.021
Two mathematicians,

14:27.060 --> 14:30.268
both collaborating on the
same infamous problem,

14:30.300 --> 14:34.191
both killed within an hour of
each other by the same shooter.

14:34.240 --> 14:36.959
Obviously, not
a coincidence.

14:37.010 --> 14:39.467
Your friend said
that a solution

14:39.510 --> 14:42.138
to P_v_ersus NP is worth
a million dollars, right?

14:42.180 --> 14:44.239
It's hard to imagine

14:44.280 --> 14:46.919
there's only two people
trying to solve it.

14:46.950 --> 14:49.145
You think they were
killed by a competitor.

14:49.180 --> 14:51.239
Would make sense,
wouldn't it?

14:51.290 --> 14:53.952
I mean, someone realizes
how far they've come,

14:53.990 --> 14:56.288
murders them to keep them
from solving it first.

14:56.320 --> 14:58.049
Question is,

14:58.090 --> 15:00.320
how did they realize
how far they'd come?

15:00.360 --> 15:03.921
Both men clearly paranoid about
having their work uncovered.

15:03.970 --> 15:07.292
They recorded every digit
in invisible ink.

15:07.340 --> 15:11.299
Maybe one of them bragged
to the wrong person.

15:11.340 --> 15:13.399
Says here
that CSU found some dog hairs

15:13.440 --> 15:15.579
under the arms
of Cyril Nauer's coat.

15:15.610 --> 15:18.943
Transferred, presumably,
when the shooter dragged

15:18.980 --> 15:21.312
Mr. Nauer into the alleyway.

15:21.350 --> 15:23.215
Is there a picture?

15:23.250 --> 15:26.310
Yeah.

15:26.350 --> 15:28.955
They sent the samples
to the lab to try to determine

15:28.990 --> 15:31.220
the dog's...
Boston terrier.

15:32.460 --> 15:34.428
So...

15:34.460 --> 15:38.123
perhaps our shooter owns a dog.

15:39.400 --> 15:42.392
Almost something, I suppose.

15:44.140 --> 15:46.233
You know, we never finished
our conversation from yesterday.

15:46.270 --> 15:48.079
(sighs)

15:48.110 --> 15:50.647
I asked you for an advance?

15:50.680 --> 15:53.240
Just out of
curi05ity, Watson,

15:53.280 --> 15:56.443
who exactly asked
you for $5,000,

15:56.480 --> 15:58.209
and what is
their connection

15:58.250 --> 16:01.151
to the man who died under
your care three years ago?

16:05.360 --> 16:07.658
You told me you had a
doctor's appointment yesterday.

16:07.700 --> 16:09.327
That was a lie.

16:09.360 --> 16:11.419
You went to visit your
former patient's grave.

16:11.470 --> 16:15.190
You've done so quite regularly
since moving in with me.

16:17.040 --> 16:19.008
It's your sleeves; they
tend to give you away.

16:19.040 --> 16:21.600
I'm able to detect _the
fragrance of carnations,

16:21.640 --> 16:23.744
but no carnations ever
appear at the brownstone.

16:23.780 --> 16:27.341
Yo_u leave them for
him, do you not?

16:27.380 --> 16:30.281
I don't mean to pry.

16:30.320 --> 16:32.208
It's just that you
went there yesterday,

16:32.250 --> 16:33.683
and when you returned,

16:33.720 --> 16:36.154
you hoped to secure a
rather substantial loan

16:36.190 --> 16:37.555
for the "son of a friend,"

16:37.590 --> 16:40.423
neither of whom you
wished to discuss.

16:40.460 --> 16:42.451
(sighs)
I'd want to make sure

16:42.500 --> 16:46.197
that this person is not
taking advantage of you.

16:49.800 --> 16:52.303
Yeah, I guess we never really...

16:52.340 --> 16:54.604
talked about this, did we?

17:01.380 --> 17:05.248
His name was Gerald Castoro.
He was my patient.

17:05.290 --> 17:06.712
He needed surgery

17:06.750 --> 17:08.479
to remove his right
adrenal gland.

17:08.520 --> 17:10.579
He had a tumor inside it.

17:10.630 --> 17:11.824
A pheochromocytoma.

17:11.860 --> 17:13.657
It's rare.

17:13.700 --> 17:16.555
And the procedure to remove
it is pretty straightforward.

17:20.100 --> 17:22.295
I nicked his vena cava.

17:22.340 --> 17:24.661
I don't know how. I just...

17:28.680 --> 17:30.648
He lost his entire
volume of blood

17:30.680 --> 17:33.513
into his abdomen in seconds.

17:37.650 --> 17:41.416
He was a nice man.
He was a dock worker.

17:45.390 --> 17:48.598
Few weeks before the surgery,
I got to know his family.

17:48.630 --> 17:51.667
His wife, his son.

17:55.200 --> 17:57.509
Mrs. Castoro did
what most people would do

17:57.540 --> 17:59.167
in her situation.

17:59.210 --> 18:01.201
She sued me.

18:01.240 --> 18:04.607
I went to court.

18:04.650 --> 18:08.245
I had to listen to her say a lot
of terrible things about me.

18:08.280 --> 18:11.386
It was a difficult process,
as you can well imagine.

18:15.860 --> 18:18.420
Gerald's son, Joey...

18:22.800 --> 18:25.894
...he was only 17 back then.

18:25.930 --> 18:29.764
He wrote me a letter.

18:29.800 --> 18:33.179
He said that he didn't blame me,
that it wasn't my fault.

18:35.180 --> 18:38.274
That he forgave me.

18:41.580 --> 18:44.743
At the time, it meant a lot.

18:49.290 --> 18:52.589
Is this the first time
he's asked you for money?

18:59.900 --> 19:02.562
His mother needed
him around a lot.

19:02.600 --> 19:05.160
(phone ringing)

19:11.580 --> 19:13.445
Detective?

19:13.480 --> 19:15.448
BELL;
Hey. I'm at Cyril Nauer's
apartment.

19:15.480 --> 19:17.641
There's some stuff here
I think you should see.

19:17.690 --> 19:22.411
Okay, so, that's Cyril Nauer's
place right there, second floor.

19:22.460 --> 19:24.519
Figured I'd just poke around,
see ifI could find

19:24.560 --> 19:26.482
any more black bulbs
like the one you found

19:26.530 --> 19:27.827
at Felix Soto's place.

19:27.860 --> 19:29.327
There weren't, but I managed

19:29.360 --> 19:30.759
to find this
in one of the fixtures.

19:30.800 --> 19:32.199
Is that a bug?

19:32.230 --> 19:33.788
CSU is

19:33.840 --> 19:35.637
going over everything
with a fine-toothed comb.

19:35.670 --> 19:38.400
But obviously, someone was
listening in on Mr. Nauer.

19:38.440 --> 19:39.964
Think they might have been
watching him, as well.

19:40.010 --> 19:41.932
That's a municipal building.
Those cameras are theirs.

19:41.980 --> 19:44.949
Even the one pointing
directly at his apartment?

19:44.980 --> 19:47.517
Taxi!

19:50.950 --> 19:52.884
Where you going?

19:52.920 --> 19:55.480
Up.

19:55.520 --> 19:57.920
Hey!

19:57.960 --> 19:59.848
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

19:59.890 --> 20:01.596
Keep your vehicle
perfectly still,

20:01.630 --> 20:03.564
I'll give you $20
for going absolutely nowhere.

20:08.400 --> 20:10.709
Yeah.

20:13.540 --> 20:14.837
(sighs)

20:14.880 --> 20:16.677
Signal jumper.
Someone's been using it

20:16.710 --> 20:18.598
to hijack
that camera's video feed,

20:18.650 --> 20:20.675
broadcast it
to a remote location.

20:20.720 --> 20:23.280
Presumably the same person
who put a listening device

20:23.320 --> 20:24.685
inside Mr. Nauer's apartment.

20:24.720 --> 20:26.244
Good news is,

20:26.290 --> 20:27.917
the jumper's transmissions
can be traced

20:27.960 --> 20:29.689
back to a receiver.
You find the receiver...

20:29.720 --> 20:31.984
Find the person who's
been spying on Nauer.

20:33.460 --> 20:36.293
Detective Bell?

20:37.470 --> 20:38.619
I'm Linus Roe.

20:38.670 --> 20:40.865
I was told you wanted
to speak with me.

20:40.900 --> 20:42.936
Your Web site says that

20:42.970 --> 20:45.359
Roe Encryption Technologies
offers the highest level

20:45.410 --> 20:46.934
encryption services
for online retailers,

20:46.970 --> 20:48.733
banks and investment firms.

20:48.780 --> 20:51.305
No mention there
of illegal surveillance.

20:51.350 --> 20:52.908
I can't imagine
why there would be.

20:52.950 --> 20:54.918
Because your company's
been filming

20:54.950 --> 20:56.474
Cyril Nauer in his home.

20:56.520 --> 20:59.284
I'm sorry.
Am I supposed to know that name?

20:59.320 --> 21:00.958
We found a signal
jumper on a camera

21:00.990 --> 21:03.049
just outside Mr.
Nauer's apartment.

21:03.090 --> 21:05.820
Now, the department's Technical
Assistance Response Unit says

21:05.860 --> 21:08.294
it was broadcasting to
your company's server.

21:08.330 --> 21:10.423
I don't know anything
about that.

21:10.470 --> 21:12.426
Well, someone here knows
something about it, Mr. Roe.

21:12.470 --> 21:13.835
And that person
may even be responsible

21:13.870 --> 21:15.394
for Mr. Nauer's death.

21:15.440 --> 21:16.839
Cyril Nauer is dead?

21:16.870 --> 21:19.259
I thought you said
you didn't know him.

21:20.980 --> 21:22.709
Okay, you're right.

21:22.740 --> 21:24.674
We were monitoring
CynlNauen

21:24.710 --> 21:26.439
It was my idea.

21:26.480 --> 21:28.448
But I am telling you
that no one at this company

21:28.480 --> 21:29.845
would hurt him,
not in a million years.

21:29.880 --> 21:31.416
All right, well, back up.

21:31.450 --> 21:32.781
Start with why
you were spying on him.

21:32.820 --> 21:34.082
Because of his work

21:34.120 --> 21:35.849
on something called
P versus NP.

21:35.890 --> 21:37.426
It's...
Filthy maths.

21:37.460 --> 21:38.825
Virtually unsolvable,
worth a million dollars.

21:38.860 --> 21:40.396
Yes, we're
familiar with it.

21:40.430 --> 21:41.692
Is that why
you were surveilling him?

21:41.730 --> 21:43.095
Because your company
needed money?

21:43.130 --> 21:44.859
You're thinking
of the Millennium Prize, right?

21:44.900 --> 21:46.993
No. A solve

21:47.030 --> 21:50.602
for P versus NP is only worth...
a million to them.

21:50.640 --> 21:53.063
To us, it's worth tens,
maybe hundreds more.

21:53.110 --> 21:55.977
I mean, mathematicians are drawn
to P versus NP

21:56.010 --> 21:58.103
because it's math's
great white whale,

21:58.150 --> 21:59.742
but the truth is...

21:59.780 --> 22:03.341
a solution would have _massive
real world implications.

22:03.390 --> 22:05.745
Such as?

22:05.790 --> 22:08.679
A correct proof would
essentially render

22:08.720 --> 22:11.359
all modern encryption obsolete.

22:11.390 --> 22:12.618
With the right software,

22:12.660 --> 22:14.491
you could hack into any system
in the world.

22:14.530 --> 22:15.895
They won't be able
to stop you.

22:15.930 --> 22:18.524
It's one equation.
How is that possible?

22:18.570 --> 22:20.765
Encryption consists of
setting up problems

22:20.800 --> 22:23.769
so complicated that a computer
can't solve them.

22:23.810 --> 22:25.903
Solving P versus NP
lets you

22:25.940 --> 22:27.931
run through the possible answer
fast enough to crack the code.

22:27.980 --> 22:29.800
I mean, you could come and go
as you please

22:29.840 --> 22:31.376
through any server
on the planet.

22:31.410 --> 22:32.968
It's a skeleton key.
It's the key

22:33.010 --> 22:35.046
to building the skeleton key.
I mean, once you had

22:35.080 --> 22:36.968
the solution,
you'd still need to write

22:37.020 --> 22:38.840
the code to apply it.

22:38.890 --> 22:41.051
The digital world
would be your oyster.

22:41.090 --> 22:42.785
You're saying a solution
would make your company

22:42.820 --> 22:44.788
about as useful as a Pet Rock?

22:44.830 --> 22:47.128
Certainly sounds like
the kind of thing

22:47.160 --> 22:48.991
a man in your position
would kill to prevent.

22:49.030 --> 22:50.691
You don't understand.

22:50.730 --> 22:53.699
I wanted Cyril
to solve P versus NP.

22:53.740 --> 22:55.799
I approached him months ago
because I believed

22:55.840 --> 22:57.831
if anyone could solve it,
it would be him.

22:57.870 --> 22:59.667
I offered to fund his work
on the condition

22:59.710 --> 23:02.076
that if he did solve
it, we would keep
the proof under wraps.

23:02.110 --> 23:04.908
At least until he helped me
to design...

23:04.950 --> 23:06.872
cryptography to defeat it.

23:06.910 --> 23:09.413
So Roe Encryption
would be proof-proof.

23:09.450 --> 23:12.544
The only company in the world
capable of defending

23:12.590 --> 23:14.888
against P versus NP technology.

23:14.920 --> 23:16.979
Oh, Cyril refused; money
didn't mean anything to him.

23:17.020 --> 23:18.681
He wanted the acclaim.

23:18.730 --> 23:21.119
But when we found out
that he was working with

23:21.160 --> 23:26.427
a man named Felix Soto,
we... infiltrated

23:26.470 --> 23:28.529
his home, as well.

23:28.570 --> 23:31.437
We took some photos
of the work they'd done.

23:31.470 --> 23:33.108
It was a total waste of time.

23:33.140 --> 23:35.677
They weren't anywhere
near a solution.

23:35.710 --> 23:37.575
That's not our understanding.

23:37.610 --> 23:39.043
We took the pictures
to an expert.

23:39.080 --> 23:41.014
She said they were
nowhere near figuring it out.

23:41.050 --> 23:42.972
Can you tell us her name?

23:43.020 --> 23:44.044
Uh, Tanya Barrett.

23:44.090 --> 23:45.216
She wrote a bunch of articles

23:45.250 --> 23:47.855
on P versus NP
a few years ago.

23:47.890 --> 23:50.688
You talk to her, she'll confirm
everything I just told you.

23:50.730 --> 23:53.551
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
everything I knew yesterday.

23:53.600 --> 23:56.023
I just didn't think my work
with Linus had anything to do

23:56.060 --> 23:57.823
with Felix Soto's death.

23:57.870 --> 23:59.929
Did you know when you reviewed
the pictures of their work

23:59.970 --> 24:01.528
that they had been
obtained illegally?

24:01.570 --> 24:04.164
I had a feeling,
but I didn't press it.

24:04.210 --> 24:06.166
The university had cut two
of my classes this year.

24:06.210 --> 24:08.132
I needed the money.
It's my understanding

24:08.180 --> 24:10.774
that you told Mr. Roe that
the calculations were no good.

24:12.550 --> 24:15.713
That was a lie, correct?

24:15.750 --> 24:17.240
From the second I saw it,

24:17.280 --> 24:19.714
I knew that the work was
Felix and Cyril's.

24:19.750 --> 24:21.479
They had taken
P versus NP

24:21.520 --> 24:23.488
farther than I'd
ever seen anyone.

24:23.530 --> 24:26.158
And still, they were only
a third of the way through.

24:26.190 --> 24:28.158
They had years of
work ahead of them.

24:28.200 --> 24:32.068
I thought ifI told Linus
that the work was bogus,

24:32.100 --> 24:33.533
that he'd back off.

24:33.570 --> 24:34.798
I knew it was wrong.

24:34.840 --> 24:36.899
But so was what Linus was doing.

24:36.940 --> 24:39.158
I guess I convinced myself
that one bad thing

24:39.210 --> 24:40.529
could cancel out another.

24:40.580 --> 24:42.730
You're a dog owner, correct?

24:42.780 --> 24:44.077
Boston terrier?

24:44.110 --> 24:45.077
How'd you know that?

24:45.110 --> 24:46.646
You registered him with the city

24:46.680 --> 24:48.773
when you procured
a pet license in 2010.

24:48.820 --> 24:50.071
We found some dog hairs

24:50.120 --> 24:51.212
on Cyril Nauer's body
that we think

24:51.250 --> 24:52.786
were transferred
from the killer.

24:52.820 --> 24:56.654
DNA test showed it came from
a Boston terrier.

24:56.690 --> 24:59.284
Guess what else you registered
with the city.

24:59.330 --> 25:01.628
.9 millimeter handgun in 2009.

25:01.660 --> 25:03.628
It's precisely
the same kind of weapon

25:03.670 --> 25:07.060
used to perforate Misters Soto
and Nauer two nights ago.

25:07.100 --> 25:09.591
This gun was stolen from
my apartment last month.

25:09.640 --> 25:11.631
There was a burglary.
I filed...

25:11.670 --> 25:13.262
You filed a police report.
Yes, we know.

25:13.310 --> 25:15.039
Only, the gun wasn't
stolen, was it?

25:15.080 --> 25:17.230
You wanted to be
able to say it was

25:17.280 --> 25:19.771
in the event someone linked
you to the two murders.

25:19.810 --> 25:20.947
Maybe you thought
you could build

25:20.980 --> 25:22.675
on what Soto and Nauer had done.

25:22.720 --> 25:24.881
Carry their ball
over the goal line.

25:24.920 --> 25:27.912
In great success,
you claim the Millennium Prize

25:27.960 --> 25:29.689
and one million dollars.

25:29.720 --> 25:31.756
Maybe you were hoping
to sell the solution

25:31.790 --> 25:34.793
to Linus Roe yourself someday,
make even more money.

25:34.830 --> 25:36.798
This is insane.

25:36.830 --> 25:39.128
I didn't kill anyone.

25:39.170 --> 25:40.637
Then you shouldn't have
any problem accounting

25:40.670 --> 25:41.830
for your whereabouts between

25:41.870 --> 25:44.236
9:00 and 10:00 pm.
two nights ago.

25:44.270 --> 25:46.636
I was at dinner with
a friend in Midtown.

25:46.670 --> 25:48.035
I got to the restaurant
around 8:30.

25:52.310 --> 25:55.677
My friend's name
is Wayne Kaneshiro.

25:55.720 --> 25:58.041
I suggest you
contact him.

25:58.090 --> 25:59.910
So, still trying to track
Wayne Kaneshiro down,

25:59.950 --> 26:02.180
but in the meantime,
I reached out to that restaurant

26:02.220 --> 26:03.949
Ms. Barrett said she went to.

26:03.990 --> 26:05.958
They said they'd e-mail me
the security footage

26:05.990 --> 26:06.957
from two nights ago.

26:06.990 --> 26:08.753
There we go.

26:11.730 --> 26:13.220
HOLMES:
I see two underage drinkers,

26:13.270 --> 26:14.737
an affair-in-progress
and a bartender

26:14.770 --> 26:15.964
who's been stealing
from the till.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.309
Not a single
college professor.

26:21.010 --> 26:21.999
Hold up.

26:22.040 --> 26:24.201
Hold up.

26:24.250 --> 26:26.343
WATSON:
8:37.

26:26.380 --> 26:28.940
That's about 20 minutes
before Felix Soto was shot.

26:28.980 --> 26:30.880
GREGSON:
Skip to the end.

26:30.920 --> 26:32.911
See when she leaves.

26:42.330 --> 26:44.867
She was telling
the truth.

26:44.900 --> 26:47.061
She's not our shooter.

26:55.080 --> 26:57.071
(crickets chirping)

26:59.310 --> 27:02.017
So, you won't go for a jog
along the river

27:02.050 --> 27:04.985
but you will do sit-ups
facing a wall at 2:00 am.

27:05.020 --> 27:07.181
Detective Bell texted to
say that he had located

27:07.220 --> 27:09.688
Tanya Barrett's
dining companion,

27:09.720 --> 27:11.051
Wayne Kaneshiro.

27:11.090 --> 27:13.081
As if the video evidence
weren't enough,

27:13.130 --> 27:14.950
he has confirmed
that he was with her

27:15.000 --> 27:17.798
between 8:30 and 10:30
the night of the murders.

27:17.830 --> 27:19.923
We remain devoid
of a suspect.

27:19.970 --> 27:21.790
Calisthenics stimulates
the heart,

27:21.840 --> 27:23.705
which increases blood flow
to the frontal lobe,

27:23.740 --> 27:25.059
which stimulates
deductive thinking.

27:25.110 --> 27:28.204
Also, the river smells
like rancid cod.

27:28.240 --> 27:30.800
What is up
with the nerd brigade?

27:30.850 --> 27:34.877
These are the other contenders
to the P versus NP throne.

27:34.920 --> 27:37.138
We may be wrong
about Tanya,

27:37.180 --> 27:39.410
but perhaps we were right
about the killer's motive.

27:39.450 --> 27:41.281
(grunts)

27:41.320 --> 27:43.208
Well, how would
they have known, uh,

27:43.260 --> 27:45.728
how much progress Soto
and Nauer made? I mean...

27:45.760 --> 27:49.753
you don't think there were more
people spying on them, do you?

27:49.800 --> 27:52.769
Watson, conundrum.
Conundrum, Watson.

27:52.800 --> 27:55.439
Oh.

27:55.470 --> 27:57.438
On another matter,
and against my better judgment,

27:57.470 --> 28:00.234
I've decided to advance you
the money that you requested.

28:00.270 --> 28:03.103
Oh. Thanks.

28:03.140 --> 28:05.005
Uh, why-why "against
your better judgment"?

28:05.050 --> 28:07.871
(sighs) You don't think it
the least bit coincidental

28:07.920 --> 28:10.787
that both you and young
Mr. Castoro decided to visit

28:10.820 --> 28:14.119
the cemetery the day
after his father's birthday?

28:14.160 --> 28:16.355
Yes. Of course I do.

28:16.390 --> 28:18.756
But you still want
to give him the money.

28:20.760 --> 28:23.024
It's complicated.
You don't know him.
I also know--

28:23.060 --> 28:25.961
as does he-- that you blame
yourself for the man's death.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.024
Because it was my fault.

28:27.070 --> 28:28.037
It was an accident.

28:28.070 --> 28:29.264
And as loathe as I am

28:29.300 --> 28:31.768
to admit it, accidents happen.

28:31.810 --> 28:34.108
Joey's goodwill

28:34.140 --> 28:35.835
obviously means
a great deal to you.

28:35.880 --> 28:38.144
But the fact that he has
on more than one occa5ion

28:38.180 --> 28:39.807
attached a dollar figure
reveals his character.

28:39.850 --> 28:41.317
Or at least it does to me.

28:41.350 --> 28:43.818
I'm an expert on
poisons, Watson.

28:43.850 --> 28:47.149
I know virtually everything
there is to know about them.

28:47.190 --> 28:49.351
But I've come to learn
over the last few years

28:49.390 --> 28:53.326
that there is nothing on this
planet quite so toxic as guilt.

28:54.930 --> 28:56.795
Are you gonna advance me
the money or not?

28:56.830 --> 28:59.128
It's in that box.

29:09.940 --> 29:12.443
Hey. There's over
$20,000 in here.

29:12.480 --> 29:14.209
I only asked for $5,000.

29:14.250 --> 29:16.946
It's every scrap of cash
I currently have at my disposal.

29:16.980 --> 29:19.915
Consider the difference
a kind of... buyout.

29:19.950 --> 29:21.952
It's a no-strings-attached
transaction which will represent

29:21.990 --> 29:24.083
the end of all business
between you and Joey.

29:24.130 --> 29:25.427
I-I don't understand.

29:25.460 --> 29:26.882
It's quite simple, really.

29:26.930 --> 29:28.090
I'm providing you
with the means

29:28.130 --> 29:29.552
to buy the young man
out of your life.

29:29.600 --> 29:31.465
He gets the money
he needs, you get

29:31.500 --> 29:33.934
the peace of mind knowing that
he'll never approach you again.

29:33.970 --> 29:36.359
I told you. I don't mind
that he approached me.

29:36.400 --> 29:39.563
I do. You've made your mistakes,
Watson. So have I.

29:39.610 --> 29:42.238
And if there's anything
that's become apparent
during our time together,

29:42.280 --> 29:43.804
it's that the great majority
of those mistakes

29:43.850 --> 29:45.943
belong firmly in the past. Hmm?

29:45.980 --> 29:48.471
Take the money.
Use it. Consider it

29:48.520 --> 29:50.886
my gift to you.

29:58.230 --> 30:00.448
Have you considered
that Tanya Barrett

30:00.490 --> 30:02.048
might be working with a partner?

30:02.100 --> 30:04.193
Somebody who committed
the crimes for her

30:04.230 --> 30:06.323
while she alibied herself
in Midtown?

30:06.370 --> 30:07.997
Considered and discarded.

30:08.040 --> 30:09.996
Why go to the trouble of allying
yourself with a partner

30:10.040 --> 30:11.359
and then arming them
with a weapon

30:11.410 --> 30:12.866
that can be traced back to you?

30:12.910 --> 30:14.537
Hmm, you're right.

30:14.580 --> 30:18.368
That would only make it easier
to connect her to the crimes.

30:18.410 --> 30:20.503
Unless, of course,
that's the intention.

30:20.550 --> 30:22.370
What if Ms. Barrett

30:22.420 --> 30:24.513
is our lead suspect
because someone wants her to be?

30:24.550 --> 30:26.586
Are you saying someone's trying
to frame her?

30:29.920 --> 30:31.888
Professor Barrett,
might I have a word?

30:31.930 --> 30:33.898
I'm late for a class,
Mr. Holmes.

30:33.930 --> 30:36.251
And I don't feel like being
accused of any more murders.

30:36.300 --> 30:38.962
All of my accusations were based
on multiple pieces of evidence

30:39.000 --> 30:40.627
pointing firmly
in your direction.

30:40.670 --> 30:42.991
I've started to think that
might not be a c0inCIdence.

30:43.040 --> 30:45.304
What are you talking about?

30:45.340 --> 30:47.001
Did you happen to mention
to anyone else

30:47.040 --> 30:49.531
that you had seen
Cyril and Felix's work, hmm?

30:49.580 --> 30:52.549
Anyone who might have felt
threatened by their progress?

30:52.580 --> 30:54.241
No, of course not.

30:54.280 --> 30:56.373
Do you have any enemies?
Jilted lover, perhaps?

30:56.420 --> 30:59.878
Or a student unhappy
with a very bad grade?

30:59.920 --> 31:01.319
Are you saying you think
I've been framed?

31:01.360 --> 31:02.884
I'm saying it might explain

31:02.920 --> 31:05.286
why you're such
an alluring suspect.

31:08.330 --> 31:11.424
No. This is crazy.

31:11.470 --> 31:13.290
You're thinking
of someone.

31:13.330 --> 31:15.867
Who is it?
(sighs)

31:18.970 --> 31:21.677
I got out of a long-term
relationship a few months ago.

31:21.710 --> 31:24.304
My ex, Jason, was very upset.

31:24.350 --> 31:25.908
He sent me _
a couple of e-mails.

31:25.950 --> 31:27.042
Threatening ones?

31:27.080 --> 31:28.115
I didn't take it personally.

31:28.150 --> 31:29.447
He's always had a temper.

31:29.480 --> 31:31.243
I just thought
he was letting off steam.

31:31.290 --> 31:33.542
These e-mails. Do you think
I might be able to see them?

31:33.590 --> 31:35.285
Give me your e-mail address
and a couple of hours,

31:35.320 --> 31:36.412
and I'll forward you the e-mails

31:36.460 --> 31:38.985
when my class lets out.

31:40.330 --> 31:42.127
Good morning!

31:42.160 --> 31:44.628
JASON: I'm sorry.
I don't know either of them.

31:44.670 --> 31:47.559
Their names were Felix Soto
and Cyril Nauer.

31:47.600 --> 31:50.592
Ring any bells?

31:50.640 --> 31:53.461
But you were romantically
involved with Tanya Barrett.

31:53.510 --> 31:56.206
Yes, until
a few months ago.

31:56.240 --> 31:57.571
Who ended the
relationship?

31:57.610 --> 31:59.202
Tanya. What's all this
about anyway?

31:59.250 --> 32:01.969
It's our understanding it was
a pretty... nasty split.

32:02.020 --> 32:03.942
There were some...

32:03.990 --> 32:07.289
unpleasant moments,
like most breakups. Why?

32:07.320 --> 32:10.289
Tanya was nice enough
to share with us

32:10.320 --> 32:13.084
some of the e-mails
that you sent.

32:13.130 --> 32:14.358
(clears throat)

32:14.400 --> 32:17.551
On November the 11th,
2012, you wrote,

32:17.600 --> 32:20.091
"You'll be sorry
you let me go.

32:20.130 --> 32:22.633
You've made a
serious mistake."

32:22.670 --> 32:24.501
Uh, December 3, 2012:

32:24.540 --> 32:27.236
"You deserve to be hurt
the way that you hurt me."

32:27.270 --> 32:29.431
Is Tanya trying to get a
restraining order or something?

32:29.480 --> 32:31.641
Because I'm telling you
right now...
These two men were shot

32:31.680 --> 32:34.444
and killed with a .9 millimeter
handgun two days ago.

32:34.480 --> 32:36.209
We think that
whoever murdered them

32:36.250 --> 32:39.310
may be trying to frame Tanya
for the crimes.

32:39.350 --> 32:41.113
What are you talking about?

32:41.160 --> 32:43.310
You think I shot these guys?
Just because Tanya dumped me?

32:43.360 --> 32:45.385
BELL: Jason, we know
you knew them.

32:45.430 --> 32:47.386
Tanya told us you met them
back when she was writing

32:47.430 --> 32:49.352
her articles
for P versus NP.

32:49.400 --> 32:51.129
I've never seen these guys
before in my life.

32:51.170 --> 32:52.626
Your e-mails tell
a different story.

32:52.670 --> 32:54.661
The threats you made
against Tanya were enough for us

32:54.700 --> 32:57.533
to get a warrant
to search your account.

32:57.570 --> 32:59.401
In another e-mail
you wrote in 2010,

32:59.440 --> 33:01.476
you complained about getting
dragged to interviews

33:01.510 --> 33:04.047
she was doing for her articles,
you mention Mr. Soto

33:04.080 --> 33:07.277
and Mr. Nauer by name, and
you accuse her of caring more

33:07.310 --> 33:10.711
about P versus NP than she
did your relationship.

33:10.750 --> 33:12.581
I didn't write this.

33:12.620 --> 33:14.315
Nor did you place
an online order

33:14.360 --> 33:16.214
for .9 millimeter ammunition
earlier today.

33:16.260 --> 33:18.421
BELL: Here's the confirmation,
in case you want

33:18.460 --> 33:20.428
to re-familiarize
yourself.

33:20.460 --> 33:23.293
Makes me think maybe you had
a couple more mathematicians

33:23.330 --> 33:24.592
in your crosshairs.

33:29.600 --> 33:31.101
He wants a lawyer.

33:31.140 --> 33:32.698
Oh, one probably isn't
gonna be enough.

33:32.740 --> 33:34.708
I just got a call
from Stuyvesant Memorial.

33:34.740 --> 33:37.379
That mugger that got shot
outside of Felix Soto's place?

33:37.410 --> 33:39.640
The one who didn't
stand a chance in hell?

33:39.680 --> 33:40.578
He's awake.

33:40.610 --> 33:41.770
Get his statement

33:41.820 --> 33:43.344
before he takes
another turn.

33:43.380 --> 33:46.110
He identifies Jason Harrison
as his shooter,

33:46.150 --> 33:48.459
we got him.

33:48.490 --> 33:50.310
Look, man, I'm
just saying,

33:50.360 --> 33:52.225
why don't you talk to the DA.

33:52.260 --> 33:54.194
Yeah, tell him to
go easy on me.

33:54.230 --> 33:56.596
Or maybe you can describe
the person who shoot you

33:56.630 --> 33:58.769
and take comfort in the
knowledge they won't be back

33:58.800 --> 34:00.427
to finish the job.

34:02.500 --> 34:06.607
She about five-six,
mid-305, if I had to guess.

34:06.640 --> 34:08.073
You said "she."

34:08.110 --> 34:09.634
Yeah, she.

34:09.680 --> 34:11.375
Long brown hair,

34:11.410 --> 34:14.345
glasses.

34:15.820 --> 34:17.344
Yeah, that's her.

34:17.380 --> 34:19.086
That's the bitch
shot me.

34:19.120 --> 34:21.611
Right after she shot
that other dude in the house.

34:21.660 --> 34:23.082
Are you positive?

34:23.120 --> 34:25.657
She was standing
two feet from me.

34:25.690 --> 34:27.351
All right? That's her.

34:27.390 --> 34:29.199
No doubt.

34:34.870 --> 34:38.328
Benny Charles insists
he was shot by Tanya Barrett.

34:38.370 --> 34:40.361
She, of course,
has an alibi.

34:40.410 --> 34:42.878
She was dining with
Wayne Kaneshiro at the time

34:42.910 --> 34:46.573
and could not have shot
Charles, Soto or Nauer.

34:46.610 --> 34:51.513
And yet... further analysis of
the hairs found on Nauer's body

34:51.550 --> 34:53.518
have conﬁrmed
that they don't come from

34:53.550 --> 34:57.486
just any Boston terrier, but
the one owned by Ms. Barrett.

34:57.520 --> 34:59.681
She also once owned
the same type of handgun

34:59.730 --> 35:01.721
used to commit the murders.

35:01.760 --> 35:03.125
Jason Harrison, meanwhile,

35:03.160 --> 35:05.628
he has means and motive
to frame Tanya.

35:05.670 --> 35:08.764
Several e_-mails seem
to implicate him.

35:08.800 --> 35:11.303
But Benny Charles insists

35:11.340 --> 35:13.558
he was shot by Tanya Barrett.

35:13.610 --> 35:15.578
Who has an alibi.

35:15.610 --> 35:17.828
You know we're going
in circles here, right?

35:17.880 --> 35:19.848
We're in a roundabout.

35:19.880 --> 35:23.748
We just need to find
the proper exit.

35:23.780 --> 35:25.782
(exhales)

35:25.820 --> 35:28.482
You're not gonna take
my advice, are you?

35:28.520 --> 35:30.886
You're not gonna pay Joey
to go away.

35:30.920 --> 35:35.323
I think there are better
ways to spend $22,000.

35:35.360 --> 35:37.351
You could buy 8,800 beers,
for example.

35:37.400 --> 35:39.721
Mm, tempting.

35:39.770 --> 35:40.759
But no.

35:40.800 --> 35:42.336
So we're gonna continue

35:42.370 --> 35:44.736
to let him utilize you
as his own personal ATM.

35:44.770 --> 35:45.839
I didn't say that.

35:51.380 --> 35:54.770
You said 8,800 beers, right?

35:54.820 --> 35:57.345
That's only $2.50 a beer.

35:57.380 --> 35:58.745
That's what the
fat man paid.

35:58.790 --> 35:59.814
Put down ten dollars,

35:59.850 --> 36:01.784
left with four beers.

36:01.820 --> 36:03.549
WATSON:
That's pretty cheap, isn't it?

36:03.590 --> 36:04.852
HOLMES:
Cheap beer, presumably.

36:04.890 --> 36:06.528
Yeah, but this
is New York,

36:06.560 --> 36:09.256
and that isn't exactly
a dive bar.

36:09.300 --> 36:11.325
The only time you see
drinks that cheap

36:11.370 --> 36:12.621
is during happy hour.

36:12.670 --> 36:14.865
But the time is exactly...

36:14.900 --> 36:17.892
Time stamp says 9:46.

36:19.270 --> 36:20.669
Yeah.

36:23.310 --> 36:25.369
Digital time stamp.

36:27.780 --> 36:29.941
HOLMES:
You forgot to carry the one.

36:29.980 --> 36:31.618
Only joking.

36:31.650 --> 36:33.618
I'm sure your maths
is impeccable.

36:33.650 --> 36:36.619
Your plan to get away with
two murders, however...

36:36.660 --> 36:38.423
Are you out of your minds?

36:38.460 --> 36:40.325
The other day, you told us
you had dinner

36:40.360 --> 36:41.554
with a friend in Midtown.

36:41.600 --> 36:43.454
You said you were there
between 8:30

36:43.500 --> 36:45.365
and 10:30,
only you weren't.

36:45.400 --> 36:47.527
You were there
between 5:30 and 7:30.

36:47.570 --> 36:48.662
Oh, that's ridiculous.

36:48.700 --> 36:50.497
You said you got the footage

36:50.540 --> 36:52.667
from the security cameras
in the restaurant.

36:52.710 --> 36:53.802
And it did confirm
your alibi.

36:53.840 --> 36:55.432
According to the
date-time stamp,

36:55.480 --> 36:57.300
you and your friend,
Mr. Kaneshiro,

36:57.340 --> 37:00.446
arrive at 8:37
and leave at 10:44.

37:00.480 --> 37:03.017
Then I don't understand.
Why are you harassing me?

37:03.050 --> 37:06.281
When we met with Linus Roe the
other day, he explained to us

37:06.320 --> 37:07.912
that aside from its applications

37:07.950 --> 37:09.952
in the world
of theoretical maths,

37:09.990 --> 37:11.821
the solution to P versus NP

37:11.860 --> 37:13.657
would have
very real consequences,

37:13.690 --> 37:16.727
very practical consequences,
for computer science.

37:16.760 --> 37:18.523
It would be child's play,

37:18.570 --> 37:20.458
for example,
to hack the hard drive

37:20.500 --> 37:22.297
which stores and records
security footage

37:22.340 --> 37:23.591
in a Midtown restaurant

37:23.640 --> 37:25.733
and add three hours
to the date-time stamp.

37:25.770 --> 37:27.465
A few days ago,
we thought that

37:27.510 --> 37:29.000
you killed
Felix Soto and Cyril Nauer

37:29.040 --> 37:31.474
in the hopes of solving
P versus NP yourself someday.

37:31.510 --> 37:34.877
Now we know you killed them
because you'd already solved it.

37:34.920 --> 37:37.480
You teamed up with
a computer programmer,
who could write the code

37:37.520 --> 37:39.988
required to steal
several hundred million dollars

37:40.020 --> 37:42.352
_ from various
finanCIal institutions.

37:42.390 --> 37:43.880
WATSON: Problem was,
he needed time

37:43.920 --> 37:45.683
to write the appropriate code
for each one.

37:45.730 --> 37:46.958
Time that you feared

37:46.990 --> 37:49.356
you might not have
when you learned that

37:49.400 --> 37:51.368
Nauer and Soto were
just a hop, skip and a jump

37:51.400 --> 37:54.437
away from their own solution
to P versus NP.

37:54.470 --> 37:57.030
You killed them,
lest they take their work public

37:57.070 --> 38:00.733
and send shockwaves through
the digital security industry.

38:00.770 --> 38:02.476
I don't know where
you're getting this.

38:02.510 --> 38:03.636
BELL:
Wayne Kaneshiro

38:03.680 --> 38:04.908
is where we're getting this.

38:04.950 --> 38:06.645
Your dinner date
from the other night.

38:06.680 --> 38:08.648
And the computer programmer

38:08.680 --> 38:10.568
you've been working with.

38:10.620 --> 38:12.417
HOLMES:
Mr. Kaneshiro had written code

38:12.450 --> 38:14.782
which allowed you
to hack your ex's e-mail...

38:14.820 --> 38:17.050
plant incriminating letters.

38:17.090 --> 38:18.853
He'd given Detective Bell
a statement saying

38:18.890 --> 38:20.926
that the two of you
were in the restaurant

38:20.960 --> 38:23.656
between the hours
of 8:30 and 10:30.

38:23.700 --> 38:26.521
Once we were able to demonstrate
that was a lie,

38:26.570 --> 38:28.629
he told us everything.

38:31.970 --> 38:33.460
JOEY:
Hey.

38:35.380 --> 38:37.405
Hey, sorry I'm late.
That's okay.

38:37.440 --> 38:39.943
So, you said on the phone
you had news.

38:39.980 --> 38:41.971
I've decided to
make an investment.

38:42.020 --> 38:43.419
This is huge.

38:43.450 --> 38:44.986
Um, seriously,
I told my partner...

38:45.020 --> 38:47.113
I'm not investing
in the bar, Joey.

38:47.150 --> 38:49.414
I'm investing in you.

38:49.460 --> 38:52.429
You know, before your
father's surgery, he and I

38:52.460 --> 38:54.087
spent a lot of
time together.

38:54.130 --> 38:57.691
But what you probably don't know
is how much we talked about you.

38:57.730 --> 39:00.426
He was so proud that you were
gonna become an engineer,

39:00.470 --> 39:02.859
and then when you earned
that scholarship, he was...

39:02.900 --> 39:05.437
(sighs)

39:05.470 --> 39:07.904
Aanay, listen, I want to
offer you a new scholarship.

39:07.940 --> 39:10.909
A check for $22,000--

39:10.940 --> 39:13.875
enough to finish your
undergraduate degree.

39:13.910 --> 39:15.844
Um, that is a...

39:15.880 --> 39:18.587
(chuckles):
a very generous offer.

39:20.550 --> 39:23.451
But school just isn't for me
right now. Maybe after...

39:23.490 --> 39:26.618
That is the only help that
I feel comfortable offering.

39:28.630 --> 39:32.396
So you... you clearly
have the cash...

39:32.430 --> 39:36.161
but you'll only let me have it
if I do what you think is right.

39:36.200 --> 39:39.567
I want to do what's right
by your dad.
My dad.

39:39.610 --> 39:41.931
The one guy who isn't here
right now to help me

39:41.980 --> 39:43.470
because of you.

39:46.610 --> 39:49.408
I'm sorry. Just...

39:49.450 --> 39:52.647
You don't deserve that.

39:56.990 --> 39:59.857
I will support you
in whatever you do.

39:59.890 --> 40:03.189
If you open up a bar,
it'll be my new watering hole.

40:03.230 --> 40:08.099
If you need to talk,
I am just a phone call away.

40:08.130 --> 40:12.533
But I am only going to pay
for your education.

40:13.840 --> 40:15.808
So you tell me,

40:15.840 --> 40:18.741
what do you want?

40:22.550 --> 40:24.142
(horn honks)

40:25.750 --> 40:27.809
(door opens)

40:27.850 --> 40:29.579
(door closes)

40:34.900 --> 40:37.892
Hey. What are you doing?

40:37.930 --> 40:41.991
I am taking one last look
at P versus NP.

40:42.040 --> 40:44.804
What do you mean,
"last look"?

40:44.840 --> 40:48.799
The NSA has asked the NYPD
to surrender...

40:48.840 --> 40:52.003
everything and anything
pertaining to the problem,

40:52.050 --> 40:54.075
including Tanya Barrett.

40:54.110 --> 40:56.214
They want her
in federal custody?

40:56.250 --> 40:59.879
They claim it's in the interest
of protecting the country

40:59.920 --> 41:02.457
against her breakthrough.

41:04.260 --> 41:07.229
She alleges
she never kept any hard copies,

41:07.260 --> 41:09.990
and she says she will
only explain her work

41:10.030 --> 41:13.090
in exchange for a deal.

41:13.130 --> 41:16.099
District attorney, however,
has little interest.

41:16.140 --> 41:19.234
So it seems,
in spite of everything...

41:23.240 --> 41:26.539
into obsolescence after all.

41:26.580 --> 41:28.548
How was coffee?

41:28.580 --> 41:30.844
Joey said that he would think
about my offer,

41:30.880 --> 41:33.087
but I am not holding my breath.

41:33.120 --> 41:35.714
I thought your plan
was quite clever.

41:35.760 --> 41:38.115
You demonstrated your goodwill
without allowing him

41:38.160 --> 41:41.254
to take further advantage.

41:41.290 --> 41:43.599
You know that if he had
taken me up on that offer,

41:43.630 --> 41:44.995
I was going
to pay you back, right?

41:45.030 --> 41:47.590
You know I have about
as much interest in money

41:47.630 --> 41:50.133
as I do Hummel figurines.

41:50.170 --> 41:53.662
Either way, thank you.

41:56.210 --> 42:00.078
You know, I-I'd quite like
to go with you next time.

42:04.150 --> 42:06.880
To the cemetery.

42:06.920 --> 42:09.582
Obviously,

42:09.620 --> 42:12.623
the mistake that you made,
it, uh...

42:12.660 --> 42:15.026
changed the course of your life.

42:15.060 --> 42:17.756
*

42:17.800 --> 42:22.191
The man_ seems _to have left
qUIte an impressmn, as well.

42:25.170 --> 42:28.606
I'd just like
to pay my respects.

42:32.050 --> 42:34.041
I'd like that.
