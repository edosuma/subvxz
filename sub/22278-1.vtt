00:06.933 --> 00:11.800
NARRATOR: On this episode of
Life Below Zero,
it's every man for himself.

00:11.833 --> 00:15.300
Here in nature,
it's kill or be killed.

00:15.333 --> 00:17.633
NARRATOR: Sue confronts
her darkest fears.

00:17.667 --> 00:19.400
SUE: It's a man killer.

00:19.433 --> 00:22.267
It's gonna defend its life
with everything it's got
and it's got an arsenal.

00:22.300 --> 00:24.900
NARRATOR: While Andy and Kate
spill blood for guts.

00:24.933 --> 00:27.233
ANDY: We basically
have nothing stored
for the winter.

00:27.267 --> 00:29.733
NARRATOR: The Hailstones
battle the coming freeze.

00:29.767 --> 00:32.367
The ice can just form
and you lose your whole net.

00:32.400 --> 00:35.933
NARRATOR: And Erik ventures
to the edge of Alaska
in search of food.

00:47.833 --> 00:52.900
In a few short weeks,
Alaska will be held
in winter's deathly grip.

00:52.933 --> 00:56.100
For the men and women
who choose to live here,
it's an urgent race

00:56.133 --> 00:58.900
to get prepared before
the freeze takes hold.

00:58.933 --> 01:03.433
But in Kavik,
the bears are still weeks away
from hibernation.

01:03.467 --> 01:07.533
My name is Susan Aikens
and I live on
the north slope of Alaska.

01:07.567 --> 01:09.200
I'm the owner
of Kavik River Camp.

01:09.233 --> 01:11.567
It's a remote
fuelling station.

01:11.600 --> 01:14.433
For nine months
out of the year,
I'm 100% alone.

01:14.467 --> 01:17.367
The closest neighbours
that I do have
on a consistent basis

01:17.400 --> 01:20.467
are the 83 grizzlies that live
within 10 miles from my camp.

01:21.667 --> 01:23.667
Welcome to Kavik.

01:23.700 --> 01:27.433
NARRATOR: This year
the grizzlies are getting
too close for comfort.

01:27.467 --> 01:28.833
SUE: The bears are awake.

01:28.867 --> 01:31.000
I've had a couple of them
harassing camp.

01:31.033 --> 01:33.567
There was a bear
headed towards camp
last night.

01:33.600 --> 01:34.733
He got close.

01:34.767 --> 01:36.800
We're talking
an inland grizzly.

01:36.833 --> 01:40.033
This is a top predator.
It's a man killer.

01:40.067 --> 01:44.267
It's gonna defend its life
with everything it's got,
and it's got an arsenal.

01:44.300 --> 01:46.733
I've been attacked.
I don't wanna be
attacked again.

01:46.767 --> 01:49.500
One of the biggest things
that I want to do right now

01:49.533 --> 01:52.100
is go out there,
do some target practise.

01:52.133 --> 01:55.100
Take a few shots and make sure
that I'm on target.

01:55.133 --> 02:00.467
I want the safety of knowing
if I point it, and I shoot,
it will go down.

02:01.200 --> 02:02.600
And it's a challenge for me.

02:05.067 --> 02:07.167
NARRATOR: Taking down
a 1,000-pound grizzly

02:07.200 --> 02:10.467
at 400 yards requires
a perfect shot.

02:13.467 --> 02:14.967
Nope.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.433
SUE: About five,
six years ago,

02:16.467 --> 02:19.133
a smart bear who was hiding,
reached out and snatched me

02:19.167 --> 02:23.500
and drug me up into the tundra
just a few yards
from the tent.

02:25.833 --> 02:29.633
The hips were torn out
of the socket, you know,
discs spit out.

02:29.667 --> 02:33.867
I mean, you can still feel
here and here where his teeth
went into my head.

02:34.500 --> 02:35.767
(RIFLE SHOTS)

02:38.233 --> 02:42.567
Imagine the sound it makes
when a bear's crunching
on your own head

02:42.600 --> 02:44.167
and has his jaws
on your throat.

02:44.200 --> 02:45.800
You don't know if that's
your last minute.

02:48.633 --> 02:51.400
And it took 10 days for
somebody to find me,

02:51.433 --> 02:54.233
but has it changed me?
Yeah, some.

02:54.267 --> 02:56.433
I'm not gonna say
I'm more of a pussy now,

02:56.467 --> 02:59.467
but I accepted that
I may be bear crap any day.

03:01.167 --> 03:03.500
You cannot live here
and do this without accepting

03:03.533 --> 03:05.200
your place in the food chain.

03:05.233 --> 03:08.833
There's the bottom.
There's the top.
And I'm somewhere around here.

03:12.467 --> 03:14.667
Well, let's go look at it.

03:14.700 --> 03:20.033
We got one here, one there.
It's good, it's good.

03:20.067 --> 03:23.000
I'm in the kill zone.
You got to remember, I mean,

03:23.033 --> 03:28.033
the can is this big, the bear
is gonna be this big

03:28.067 --> 03:30.633
with a kill zone like that.

03:30.667 --> 03:32.267
No, I'm pleased with it.

03:32.300 --> 03:37.333
It is a mind pooch for me
to go and actively hunt
a bear.

03:37.367 --> 03:40.200
I mean, I need...
I want the meat.

03:40.233 --> 03:44.333
I want the hide.
I want the fat.

03:44.367 --> 03:46.900
I'd like to find the one
that's harassing camp.

03:46.933 --> 03:50.700
So, it's time to get
a little bit more aggressive.

03:50.733 --> 03:55.367
But in the back of my mind,
I've got a lot of memories
that are getting away.

03:55.400 --> 03:57.100
So, it's a good thing.

03:57.133 --> 03:59.133
Get back in the saddle
and see what happens.

04:04.567 --> 04:06.967
CHIP:
Subsistence is basically,
do-it-yourself.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.233
When you're subsistence
fishing, you're fishing for
your own needs, your own food.

04:10.267 --> 04:12.633
You're not buying it
from a store, it wasn't raised
in a factory.

04:12.667 --> 04:14.033
This is the way to go.

04:23.267 --> 04:24.667
We're not at the end
of the road,

04:24.700 --> 04:26.767
we're 300 miles away
from the end of the road.

04:27.533 --> 04:29.567
We fish, we trap, we hunt.

04:30.700 --> 04:32.133
I like being self-sufficient.

04:32.167 --> 04:33.967
I do what I do because it
doesn't matter who or where
you are.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.800
If you're a man, you can hunt.

04:35.833 --> 04:40.333
So I came up here in 1988
and I've decided
not to go anywhere.

04:43.100 --> 04:44.700
NARRATOR: With seven mouths
to feed at home

04:44.733 --> 04:47.633
and elders to support
in their isolated village,

04:47.667 --> 04:52.700
Chip and Agnes Hailstone
depend on the land to provide
most of the food they eat.

04:52.733 --> 04:57.000
I've been waiting to do some
fishing, but I was expecting
to do it under the ice.

04:57.033 --> 05:02.833
I don't know if there's going
to be any whitefish at all,
but I might have a hope.

05:02.867 --> 05:04.467
CHIP: We're gonna use
our boat,

05:04.500 --> 05:06.867
we're gonna go put the nets
out until it starts to freeze.

05:06.900 --> 05:08.600
Once it starts to freeze,
we'll take the nets out.

05:08.633 --> 05:10.133
But the thing is,
that the fish are going by,

05:10.167 --> 05:11.800
regardless of it freezing
over or not.

05:11.833 --> 05:15.267
It doesn't matter
if the water's hard
or the water's soft.

05:15.300 --> 05:17.467
-AGNES: Wait! One, two...
-Same time. Ready?
One, two, three!

05:18.933 --> 05:21.600
CHIP: My wife has a tradition
of fishing here all winter.

05:21.633 --> 05:24.067
Her dad grew up doing that
and her grandparents did that

05:24.100 --> 05:25.767
and the people before them
did that.

05:25.800 --> 05:28.767
NARRATOR: Unusual weather
is disrupting
Chip and Agnes's ability

05:28.800 --> 05:30.500
to find resources.

05:30.533 --> 05:32.367
Waiting is not an option.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.933
AGNES: This year
is totally different.

05:34.967 --> 05:39.367
I guess it has to do with
global warming or something,
but our river's not frozen.

05:39.400 --> 05:43.100
It's like three weeks late
and it's still running.

05:43.133 --> 05:46.700
Usually we've come put
our nets out under the ice.

05:46.733 --> 05:50.533
But we didn't get a chance
to do that.

05:50.567 --> 05:52.800
It's sun shining
and the river's flowing

05:52.833 --> 05:57.167
when it should be cold
and dark and clear. (CHUCKLES)

05:57.200 --> 06:00.400
But the fish ain't waiting
for the ice to freeze.

06:00.433 --> 06:02.967
It's just like
freaking me out a little.

06:04.933 --> 06:06.333
AGNES: Okay, just about ready?

06:06.367 --> 06:09.767
CHIP: Mmm-hmm.
So are you ready to feed?

06:09.800 --> 06:12.333
-I'm gonna go out.
-Yup!

06:18.400 --> 06:22.200
When you have your nets out
and it's not totally frozen,
the ice can just form

06:22.233 --> 06:27.633
and just come take your net
away and then you lose
your whole net.

06:27.667 --> 06:32.033
Yeah, it's a little bit risky,
but it's worth it.
The whitefish are worth it.

06:32.067 --> 06:34.633
Hopefully I'm not out here
wasting my time.

06:34.667 --> 06:37.300
-CHIP: Yeah, I'm just going
as slow as I can.
-Yup.

06:37.333 --> 06:38.400
Hold on!

06:38.433 --> 06:39.600
CHIP: You got time.

06:39.633 --> 06:42.500
Yee-hee!
I don't want it to rip my net.

06:42.533 --> 06:43.867
There! Go ahead!

06:46.833 --> 06:47.967
Okay!

06:49.200 --> 06:51.033
I think that's
at the drop-off.

06:51.067 --> 06:53.767
-I can't hear you.
-That's good!

06:53.800 --> 06:55.367
-Should I go park the boat?
-AGNES: Yup!

06:56.800 --> 06:58.767
-Thank you!
-Yup!

07:04.300 --> 07:07.400
Well, we're just gonna have to
leave it there
for a little bit

07:07.433 --> 07:12.633
and just come back later
and see how it's doing.
I hope I catch some fish.

07:12.667 --> 07:15.800
Sure wouldn't mind
a real good load of fish.

07:17.967 --> 07:20.033
ERIK: My choice in life
to live out in the bush

07:20.067 --> 07:21.633
and do the things that I do.

07:21.667 --> 07:23.500
All it is, is a choice.

07:23.533 --> 07:26.467
It's an unbelievable life
I get to live. I feel
very fortunate every day.

07:41.133 --> 07:43.933
My name is Erik Salitan,
I'm a registered
guide outfitter.

07:43.967 --> 07:46.767
I live in the Arctic of Alaska
in the village of Wiseman.

07:46.800 --> 07:51.400
Right now I'm in Iliamna,
Alaska, just finishing up
my coastal brown bear season.

07:51.433 --> 07:53.167
NARRATOR: With his
guiding season over,

07:53.200 --> 07:55.467
Erik plans to make the most
of his remaining time

07:55.500 --> 08:00.100
in the southern part
of the state to stock up
for winter.

08:00.133 --> 08:01.333
ERIK: The guiding season
is over,

08:01.367 --> 08:04.400
and I'm happy just to unwind
here, and look forward

08:04.433 --> 08:06.367
to just doing a little
personal hunting of my own

08:06.400 --> 08:09.167
and get ready for
winter trapping season,
which is my passion.

08:13.433 --> 08:17.100
Alaska has more
brown bear, grizzly bears
than ever in recorded history.

08:17.133 --> 08:21.467
There's an estimated 35,000 to
40,000 bears in the state
of Alaska.

08:21.500 --> 08:25.333
Here on the Alaska peninsula,
is one bear
every square mile.

08:25.367 --> 08:28.033
Whereas up in the Brooks Range
where I live year round,

08:28.067 --> 08:30.600
it's up to one every
50 square miles.

08:30.633 --> 08:32.967
So there's a lot more
bears here.

08:33.000 --> 08:38.733
While I was out stretching
my legs, I discovered here
a bear-killed bear.

08:38.767 --> 08:41.367
So right at the base of this
big mound you can see
the carcass

08:41.400 --> 08:44.333
of the smaller brown bear
that the larger bear killed.

08:44.367 --> 08:49.133
The bottom line is,
here in nature,
it's kill or be killed.

08:49.167 --> 08:52.500
That's a more than respectably
sized paw.

08:52.533 --> 08:55.033
You wouldn't want that
to tear into you.

08:55.067 --> 08:57.900
That was probably a
7.5 to 8' bear.

08:57.933 --> 08:59.867
And this was the loser.

08:59.900 --> 09:03.433
The big bear, he weighed more
than twice what this bear did.

09:03.467 --> 09:06.267
There's a pelvis right here
and the spine of the bear.

09:06.300 --> 09:08.333
That bear,
he entirely consumed him.

09:08.367 --> 09:13.733
He's actually cracked open
the skull to get the brains,
he's ate the tongue out of it.

09:13.767 --> 09:16.167
I mean, he's really
just chewed it all to heck.

09:16.200 --> 09:18.567
I mean,
this is freaking awesome.

09:20.067 --> 09:22.767
Nothing gets me more excited
than to come out

09:22.800 --> 09:24.967
and to see this kind of things
in the natural world.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.733
I mean, a true 10' bear.

09:26.767 --> 09:30.433
He killed this, you know,
4 or 500 pound bear,
and he ate him.

09:30.467 --> 09:31.867
And that's awesome!

09:35.333 --> 09:36.633
ANDY: No matter how much
you prepare,

09:36.667 --> 09:38.900
it seems like you're never
prepared for winter.

09:38.933 --> 09:41.233
And when it comes,
it comes with vengeance.

09:41.267 --> 09:43.367
And it comes fast.
And it comes hard.

09:56.900 --> 10:02.733
My name is Andy Bassich,
I live about 15 miles
downriver from Eagle, Alaska.

10:02.767 --> 10:05.167
I like being as independent
as I can.

10:05.200 --> 10:11.067
Everything you see around
here, I did pretty much solo
or with the help from Kate.

10:11.100 --> 10:16.600
I'm gonna pull the bulldozer
up, I want to hook the bridle
onto the chain there.

10:16.633 --> 10:20.900
These days are jam-packed
full of work, work, work.

10:20.933 --> 10:23.567
We're only two people,
but we can get it done.

10:23.600 --> 10:27.567
Living out in remote areas,
you rely on
the natural resources.

10:27.600 --> 10:30.933
And for us fishing for
chum salmon is probably

10:30.967 --> 10:33.000
the most important thing
we do every year.

10:33.033 --> 10:36.033
It feeds our dogs
for 365 days.

10:36.067 --> 10:41.800
I depend on them for safe
transportation, companionship,
and to protect us.

10:41.833 --> 10:46.233
A day or two ago we just fed
out the last stick of fish
to the dogs.

10:46.267 --> 10:50.400
Right now the total focus
in my mind is getting
that fish wheel in the river

10:50.433 --> 10:53.333
and starting to turn it
and getting slimy with fish.

10:55.233 --> 10:57.800
It's kind of
an automatic fishing machine.

10:57.833 --> 11:02.700
It's an ancient design,
brought over to North America
during the Gold Rush of 1896.

11:03.800 --> 11:05.200
It's relentless.

11:05.233 --> 11:09.033
There's no motors,
it's all by the power
of the river.

11:09.067 --> 11:12.633
I could stick
this fish wheel in
and I'll catch 500 fish a day.

11:15.900 --> 11:18.367
I've built a lot
of fish wheels over the years.

11:18.400 --> 11:22.833
This wheel here was the result
of 30 years of building them

11:22.867 --> 11:26.500
and seeing what works,
what holds up,
and what doesn't hold up.

11:26.533 --> 11:30.067
Pushing this fish wheel in
is a bit of a challenge.

11:30.100 --> 11:33.567
It's not really designed
to be twisted or turned
at all.

11:33.600 --> 11:35.600
We're going down over
a pretty steep bank,

11:35.633 --> 11:39.000
so there's gonna be a lot
of weight, a lot of momentum.

11:39.033 --> 11:43.100
If it gives out as I'm trying
to pull it down
into the river, I'm screwed.

11:43.133 --> 11:48.333
So we have to go slow
and Kate will be my
second pair of eyes here

11:48.367 --> 11:51.833
to kind of listen and watch,
and hopefully we'll get it
in the water.

11:52.667 --> 11:53.733
Without any damage.

11:59.700 --> 12:02.300
Damn it! Fuckin' eh!

12:02.333 --> 12:05.000
NARRATOR: Andy and Kate
must successfully launch
their fish wheel

12:05.033 --> 12:08.767
into the Yukon to catch
a year's supply of food
for their dogs.

12:08.800 --> 12:11.033
They cannot risk damaging it.

12:11.067 --> 12:13.733
ANDY: This isn't working
worth a shit.

12:22.133 --> 12:24.133
There's a lot on my shoulders
right now.

12:24.167 --> 12:25.933
I've got to start fishing.

12:25.967 --> 12:28.533
We basically have nothing
stored for the winter.

12:31.200 --> 12:34.500
Andy's taking
the bracing off
the fish wheel now

12:34.533 --> 12:37.867
and pretty soon we'll see
those baskets turn.

12:37.900 --> 12:41.533
Without this fish wheel,
I don't think that we could
afford to live down here.

12:41.567 --> 12:44.233
Twenty-five dogs is a lot
of mouths to feed.

12:44.267 --> 12:48.133
So it saves us thousands
of dollars a year
in dog food alone.

12:48.167 --> 12:54.167
A year's supply of salmon
for 25 dogs and two adults,
you do the math.

12:54.933 --> 12:56.600
Are we ready to roll?

12:56.633 --> 12:58.500
-ANDY: I think so.
-All right!

12:59.567 --> 13:01.567
Fish! Fish! Fish!

13:01.600 --> 13:03.167
Here we go!

13:04.000 --> 13:05.633
Yoo-hoo!

13:07.833 --> 13:09.467
(KATE LAUGHS)

13:09.500 --> 13:11.000
Feeling pretty good!

13:13.867 --> 13:17.967
So right now, the current
of the river is pushing
this thing, making it turn.

13:18.000 --> 13:21.500
Basically like a giant
water wheel with scoops.

13:21.533 --> 13:25.100
Fish are gonna swim upstream
and the scoop
will pick them up.

13:25.133 --> 13:29.500
And they'll come up in the air
and the fish come sliding out
into the box.

13:29.533 --> 13:31.067
And then they're dog food.

13:32.867 --> 13:37.667
I think the most important
thing in my life
is independence and freedom.

13:37.700 --> 13:40.567
There's very few places left
in the world
where you can go live

13:40.600 --> 13:44.467
and carve out a life
for yourself and do it
on your own terms.

13:44.500 --> 13:47.267
And that's why I work
the way I do to live here.

13:47.300 --> 13:48.800
That it for the night?

13:48.833 --> 13:51.933
-I want to go
get my tape measure.
-Fish!

13:51.967 --> 13:54.867
We got fish! (LAUGHS)

14:02.233 --> 14:04.933
It's a good thing.

14:04.967 --> 14:09.667
I think the run's happening
right now, we're kind of
missing out on it.

14:09.700 --> 14:13.033
So it's good we're getting
the wheel in now.

14:13.067 --> 14:17.700
This girl's got
a lot of buddies out there.

14:17.733 --> 14:20.267
CHIP: Our deal is to be
out here
and to get what we can.

14:21.633 --> 14:23.967
We don't survive here,
we live.

14:36.867 --> 14:40.500
AGNES: We're just about
to check our net
down the river.

14:40.533 --> 14:42.967
We set our net yesterday.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.833
Knowing if, when the ice
gets a little thicker,

14:45.867 --> 14:49.733
then it just could take my net
away, but it's just now
starting to freeze

14:49.767 --> 14:52.267
so hopefully there's still
whitefish.

14:52.300 --> 14:55.133
And hopefully there's still
fish with eggs in them.

14:57.100 --> 15:01.000
Hee! I'm so excited about
what's in the net.

15:01.833 --> 15:03.567
-Start it?
-CHIP: Yeah.

15:07.633 --> 15:09.000
(ENGINE SPUTTERS)

15:11.500 --> 15:13.000
AGNES: Hee, frozen?

15:13.033 --> 15:14.800
CHIP: Frozen.

15:14.833 --> 15:16.567
AGNES: We could...
(SPEAKS LOCAL LANGUAGE)

15:16.600 --> 15:18.700
CHIP: Yup.

15:18.733 --> 15:22.467
AGNES: Let us go that way
until it starts thawing out.

15:22.500 --> 15:24.733
CHIP: This time of year,
everything's freezing.

15:24.767 --> 15:27.333
My lower unit there,
I ran it clear of water

15:27.367 --> 15:29.033
as best I could
when I ran it last.

15:29.067 --> 15:32.933
But now it's full of ice,
and it won't turn.

15:32.967 --> 15:35.267
And we could make it turn,
but our biggest
problem is that

15:35.300 --> 15:37.400
the impeller in the pump
will strip.

15:37.433 --> 15:38.867
So I don't feel like
damaging it.

15:38.900 --> 15:41.200
That's why we didn't
fire up the motor.

15:41.233 --> 15:44.000
We should just
start breaking all this.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.367
CHIP: Catch it! Catch it!
You got the hook?

15:54.800 --> 15:55.867
(GRUNTS)

16:01.233 --> 16:03.800
AGNES: Oh, look a whitefish!

16:03.833 --> 16:06.067
I think that's a whitefish.
Yay!

16:06.100 --> 16:08.967
-One, and it has eggs!
-Oh! It's full of eggs, too!

16:09.000 --> 16:10.667
-(AGNES LAUGHS)
-CHIP: Yeah, right!

16:10.700 --> 16:12.400
Another one with eggs!

16:12.433 --> 16:14.500
I'm so happy
I could keep fishing!

16:14.533 --> 16:18.267
CHIP: According to some folks,
the animal spirit will return,
so folks up here say catch.

16:18.300 --> 16:21.000
They say catch 'cause
they're utilising it, not
'cause they're killing it.

16:21.033 --> 16:23.667
Death is a permanent thing.

16:23.700 --> 16:27.200
Death is like if you
wasted it, if you killed it,
threw it away.

16:27.233 --> 16:28.533
This was well worth our time.

16:28.567 --> 16:31.333
We got the egg-laden
whitefish that we wanted.

16:31.367 --> 16:33.733
We don't got a whole bunch of
them, but we didn't put out
a big net.

16:33.767 --> 16:36.100
We're opportunists,
but we also know
what to look for.

16:36.133 --> 16:38.233
This wasn't like something
that came up unexpectedly,

16:38.267 --> 16:40.733
this is something
we've anticipated
and waited for.

16:40.767 --> 16:44.367
AGNES: Good to know,
there's still whitefish
with eggs in the river.

16:44.400 --> 16:45.867
Look at that!

16:46.867 --> 16:47.967
Oh!

16:48.900 --> 16:51.400
That's beyond
kissing a goddamn fish.

16:51.433 --> 16:54.667
-Check it out, look
how much there is!
-I see! I see you're just...

16:54.700 --> 16:56.833
Man, I want to eat those,
just not like that, but...

16:56.867 --> 16:57.933
AGNES: Mmm.

16:57.967 --> 16:59.833
CHIP: My crazy Inupiaq wife.

16:59.867 --> 17:02.633
AGNES: Fish eggs, fish eggs,
eat them up, yum!

17:07.033 --> 17:09.133
ERIK: When I go out
into the woods,
I'm confident to know

17:09.167 --> 17:13.167
that I'm gonna be prepared
and ready to do battle
with nature.

17:26.067 --> 17:29.167
NARRATOR: Erik is on
the search for
a delicacy impossible to find

17:29.200 --> 17:32.500
at his home in Wiseman,
black-tailed deer.

17:32.533 --> 17:38.167
But to get one, he'll have to
fly to a remote area of
Kodiak Island.

17:38.200 --> 17:40.867
-Hey! What's going on, Taj?
Good to see you man.
-Hey, Erik, how's it going?

17:40.900 --> 17:42.800
-Ready to go out hunting?
-Let's do it.

17:42.833 --> 17:44.033
Where you fixing on going?

17:44.067 --> 17:45.933
Well, we're gonna go to
the south end of the island.

17:45.967 --> 17:49.867
There's a couple beaches
down there. Tide is low,
and we'll get in.

17:49.900 --> 17:50.933
Should be a good spot
for you.

17:50.967 --> 17:52.167
Cool. Let's go have
a look around.

17:52.200 --> 17:54.933
Kodiak Island is very similar
to the Alaska peninsula

17:54.967 --> 17:57.533
where I do my guiding
for coastal brown bears.

17:57.567 --> 18:00.767
The weather here is awful in
general and you need to be

18:00.800 --> 18:02.967
really careful about
what days you chose to fly.

18:03.000 --> 18:06.967
We better get out of here
'cause the weather's
gonna be coming in.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.933
Let's roll.

18:08.967 --> 18:13.267
In this country here,
if the weather is good,
you better go.

18:13.300 --> 18:15.200
'Cause you never know when
it's gonna get bad again.

18:15.667 --> 18:17.467
(ENGINE STARTS)

18:37.533 --> 18:39.867
(TAJ SPEAKING)

18:54.667 --> 18:58.000
NARRATOR: If the pilot
misjudges the terrain,
the plane could hit

18:58.033 --> 19:01.533
hidden boulders and holes
or get stuck in the mud.

19:13.500 --> 19:15.067
ERIK: Another good one, man!

19:15.100 --> 19:16.700
TAJ: Easy money!

19:16.733 --> 19:18.133
ERIK: Easy money.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.700
All right, buddy.
Hey, thanks a lot for the
ride.

19:23.733 --> 19:26.367
-No problem.
-Are you sure you dropped me
off in a real spot?

19:26.400 --> 19:28.667
-Well, we'll find out.
-Is this the camping spot
or the hunting spot?

19:28.700 --> 19:30.533
-We'll find out.
How good of a hunter are you?
-Okay.

19:30.567 --> 19:32.567
Uh-oh! Uh-oh!

19:35.233 --> 19:40.833
I'm out here on a beach
in Kodiak, and I got
a pile of stuff.

19:40.867 --> 19:44.300
I'm gonna hike around and find
a good camping spot
away from the tide,

19:44.333 --> 19:46.333
protected from the wind
and the weather,

19:46.367 --> 19:48.933
and then I'm gonna
pack my gear over there

19:48.967 --> 19:50.000
and get my camp set up.

19:53.600 --> 19:56.700
This is gonna be my home
away from home for a while.

19:56.733 --> 19:58.533
We're just throwing up
our bomb shelter here,

19:58.567 --> 20:01.233
you always want to set up
your tent as soon as
you get to your camp.

20:01.267 --> 20:04.233
I mean, it was pretty good
weather when we got here
but already

20:04.267 --> 20:08.100
you can see on the horizon
there's some...
Something ugly coming.

20:08.133 --> 20:10.667
Setting my tent up here,
I really can't help it

20:10.700 --> 20:13.767
'cause I had to get out
of the wind,
but there's a bear trail.

20:13.800 --> 20:17.700
So when I tie down my flaps
I'll have a little
alarm system with my...

20:17.733 --> 20:20.333
With my tie downs if
a bear comes through.

20:20.933 --> 20:22.067
Trip on my tent.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.200
It's known to happen.

20:27.367 --> 20:30.700
Comfort is subjective.
It's a matter of perception.

20:30.733 --> 20:34.167
I think excessive comfort
is detrimental to
one's character.

20:35.567 --> 20:37.967
Here in Alaska,
they have the same day
airborne law,

20:38.000 --> 20:40.733
but you may hunt deer
the same day you fly,

20:40.767 --> 20:43.633
so if a deer comes out
onto the tidal flat
or something,

20:43.667 --> 20:45.533
we'll be eating
venison tonight.

20:49.433 --> 20:51.467
It's raining
pretty good here, but,

20:51.500 --> 20:54.000
just more in the interest of
stretching the legs
than anything,

20:54.033 --> 20:57.867
I'm gonna go and do
a little walk around and
see if I can't spot a deer.

20:59.667 --> 21:03.800
NARRATOR: Erik's hunt starts
on the beach, where the tracks
of the deer he is hunting

21:03.833 --> 21:07.500
and the many bears
on the island are most
easily spotted.

21:08.967 --> 21:12.133
(SOFTLY)
There's a track, a deer track
along the beach.

21:16.933 --> 21:21.033
Just working my way
along the shore here,
really quiet.

21:21.067 --> 21:24.700
Walking on the beach
where I can keep
a pretty low profile.

21:24.733 --> 21:26.000
I'm hoping here about dark,

21:26.033 --> 21:28.133
I'll be able to walk up on
Sitka black-tailed buck.

21:28.167 --> 21:29.967
But we'll see what happens.

21:39.000 --> 21:42.033
I'm gonna have to pull
the plug here for the night.

21:42.067 --> 21:48.167
Tide's coming in, it's making
my beach really small
and it's getting dark.

21:48.200 --> 21:52.000
The tide comes in too much
on me, I won't be able
to walk the beach home

21:52.033 --> 21:55.267
and I'd have to deal with
quite a few miles of brush
and cliffs here in the dark,

21:55.300 --> 22:01.533
so I'm gonna start moving
back towards camp and get down
that beach before,

22:01.567 --> 22:03.567
before the tide gets
all the way back in.

22:08.200 --> 22:12.467
ANDY: There's very few places
left in the world where you
can go live on your own terms.

22:12.500 --> 22:15.133
This is one place that
you can still do that.

22:16.200 --> 22:19.300
My goal in my life is to
die here.

22:19.333 --> 22:22.467
You have to want to
live this way.

22:36.000 --> 22:40.633
ANDY: It's a shitty day on
the Yukon, second day of
fishing and

22:40.667 --> 22:42.633
it's not a very pleasant day
to be cutting fish.

22:42.667 --> 22:44.533
It's not a very good day
for drying fish,

22:44.567 --> 22:46.967
but it's a day
that has to be done.

22:47.000 --> 22:50.200
I've got a lot of fish
to hang in the next five
or 10 days

22:50.233 --> 22:52.867
and no matter what
Mother Nature throws at you,
you've got to get out there

22:52.900 --> 22:55.333
and do it when it's time
to do it.

22:55.367 --> 23:00.167
Well, it looks like the boxes
are overflowing.
Fish are flopping out.

23:00.667 --> 23:01.933
(LAUGHS)

23:04.500 --> 23:06.033
Welcome to my world.

23:08.933 --> 23:12.367
The fish wheels
are really wet all the time
because of the splashing.

23:12.400 --> 23:14.533
The snow is very wet
and very slippery,

23:14.567 --> 23:16.633
so I've got to be
extra careful today

23:16.667 --> 23:20.600
walking around on the wheel.
When you're by yourself
you can't take chances.

23:20.633 --> 23:24.633
And there's nobody out there
to help me if I fall in
or smack my head.

23:24.667 --> 23:27.033
There's no 911 out here.

23:27.067 --> 23:30.633
Fish wheels are not
incredibly efficient,

23:30.667 --> 23:32.867
but they're
absolutely relentless.

23:32.900 --> 23:38.200
They run 24/7, they catch
everything that swims
underneath of them.

23:38.233 --> 23:43.633
And my life here would be
a lot harder if I had to catch
all these fish with a net.

23:43.667 --> 23:48.200
So how's this for putting
fish on ice
right out of the water, huh?

23:49.933 --> 23:50.967
(LAUGHS)

23:52.467 --> 23:55.567
The Seattle fish market's got
nothing on me.

23:55.600 --> 23:58.567
I'm totally self-taught.
I've never gone to school
for anything.

23:58.600 --> 24:01.800
I've never really had
any close mentors
to teach me things.

24:01.833 --> 24:03.767
I just kind of figure it out
as I go.

24:03.800 --> 24:07.167
You kind of become
a Jack of all trades
living this lifestyle.

24:07.200 --> 24:09.567
But I enjoy that.
I love inventing things.

24:09.600 --> 24:12.200
This lifestyle allows me
to do that,

24:12.233 --> 24:15.233
pretty much unencumbered by
anybody or any other thing.

24:15.267 --> 24:17.833
It's a very satisfying way of
living for me.

24:20.433 --> 24:25.767
So there's 360 fish
in the boat, probably another
80 in the box here.

24:26.667 --> 24:29.333
I'll go cut these and
hang them,

24:29.367 --> 24:31.933
come back, finish out
this evening.

24:31.967 --> 24:36.600
Probably about 400, 450 fish
by the end of the day.

24:36.633 --> 24:39.833
That'll be a good start.
It's time to go cut fish.

24:45.433 --> 24:47.100
SUE: Bear hunting is intense.

24:47.133 --> 24:51.200
You can't go with half
your head, you've got to go
fully in the game.

24:59.433 --> 25:02.767
Bears hibernate.
That's what they do
during the winter.

25:02.800 --> 25:06.967
However, right now,
we have this unusual,

25:07.000 --> 25:09.367
really high temperature
warm-up.

25:09.400 --> 25:12.667
Well, they're still awake.
It's too warm for them
to go to bed.

25:13.433 --> 25:16.633
But their food source is gone.

25:16.667 --> 25:20.600
If a bear decides that
I look like a Scooby Snack,
I need to protect myself.

25:20.633 --> 25:24.100
As long as it is within
the season, I will actively
pursue that bear.

25:24.133 --> 25:26.633
I know there's one somewhere
real close to camp,

25:26.667 --> 25:28.333
I need to be
a little proactive.

25:28.367 --> 25:29.733
(STARTS ENGINE)

25:30.333 --> 25:31.333
So...

25:33.733 --> 25:36.833
Bear, zero. Sue, zero.
We'll see where we stand
at the end of the day.

25:39.667 --> 25:42.733
Little bit worried.
I haven't gone out

25:42.767 --> 25:46.667
and actively gone after a bear
in a lot of years.
Not since I got munched.

25:46.700 --> 25:48.700
If I'm gonna be effective
at doing this,

25:48.733 --> 25:52.567
I need to get over my
thought process on the attack,

25:52.600 --> 25:54.633
and get back
on the attack myself.

25:54.667 --> 25:57.900
It'll be good therapy.
Sue's tundra therapy.

25:57.933 --> 26:01.467
How to survive a bear attack
and then go back on
the attack.

26:10.867 --> 26:13.200
Cool, cool.

26:13.233 --> 26:17.800
Well, this is,
this is a good sign.
I mean, good and bad.

26:17.833 --> 26:22.667
This is definitely bear poopy.
This might be the one
that's been hassling camp.

26:22.700 --> 26:27.267
Cool. Well, got something
to keep our eyes out for,
that's for darn sure.

26:27.300 --> 26:29.033
We'll go see
if I can find him.

26:40.400 --> 26:41.600
Oh, look at that.

26:43.867 --> 26:47.700
It's not huge, but I...
And it's not defined.

26:47.733 --> 26:53.600
But you've got, toes...
One, two, claws.
A 6 to 8" paw.

26:53.633 --> 26:57.800
It's definitely a bear track.
Definitely going that way.

27:01.200 --> 27:06.600
I've had that bear, caught her
running through camp.

27:06.633 --> 27:09.300
You can't be staying
too far away.

27:09.333 --> 27:12.267
When you're actively
hunting a predator,
this is one of the things,

27:12.300 --> 27:14.367
if I can't see them
walking around,

27:14.400 --> 27:18.167
I've been here long enough,
I know they are around.

27:18.200 --> 27:22.300
So I can go from stalking to
being stalked in a heartbeat.

27:22.333 --> 27:25.300
It lets you know
there are animals

27:25.333 --> 27:29.067
that by for no other reason,
just, it's their nature,

27:29.633 --> 27:30.633
can take you out.

27:31.433 --> 27:33.267
You gotta keep on your toes.

27:34.433 --> 27:35.733
I think I see something.

27:39.067 --> 27:41.200
The bear is somewhere
over here.

27:43.900 --> 27:45.867
He's going away from us.

27:47.067 --> 27:48.567
I need to get closer.

27:48.600 --> 27:50.033
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

27:54.767 --> 27:57.267
When you see a bear, you run.
You don't walk.

27:58.400 --> 28:00.867
You gain ground
as fast as you can.

28:02.400 --> 28:03.867
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

28:07.033 --> 28:11.133
He's behind that knoll.
726 yards.

28:11.167 --> 28:13.500
I'd like to try and close
the distance.

28:13.533 --> 28:16.233
See that dark lump
on the next dry patch?

28:16.267 --> 28:18.567
I'd like to get there.

28:18.600 --> 28:19.833
It's a little spooky,
you know,

28:19.867 --> 28:22.267
because you're really
pushing a situation where

28:22.300 --> 28:26.967
you are trying to sneak up
on the apex predator.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.433
You don't have anywhere
to hide.

28:28.467 --> 28:32.067
The minute you're seen,
it's game on.

28:32.733 --> 28:35.400
(WHISPERING)

28:40.133 --> 28:41.800
ANDY: It's nothing
for the faint of heart.

28:41.833 --> 28:45.933
It's a dirty job,
it's a slimy job,
it's a bloody job.

28:45.967 --> 28:49.567
KATE: We're gonna be up to
our eyeballs in blood, guts
and gore.

28:49.600 --> 28:50.767
ANDY: But we love it.

29:03.033 --> 29:05.600
KATE: Oh, yeah. It's a real
blast of a way to spend a day.

29:05.633 --> 29:07.833
I can't feel
my fingers any more.

29:07.867 --> 29:10.667
ANDY: I'm doing what we call
whole fish.

29:10.700 --> 29:13.667
I'm basically just sticking
the knife in

29:13.700 --> 29:15.833
right at the lateral line
on the fish.

29:15.867 --> 29:17.133
There's a line right here
on them.

29:17.167 --> 29:19.867
That's right about
where their backbone is.

29:19.900 --> 29:24.267
I go right below the backbone,
and then we just hang them
on a pole like that.

29:24.300 --> 29:27.967
So they'll just hang on
a pole like this.
It opens them up,

29:28.000 --> 29:32.400
they dehydrate a little bit in
the winter, but not a lot.

29:32.433 --> 29:35.433
The advantage to that
is that this fish won't
dry out a lot,

29:35.467 --> 29:38.767
so it'll have a lot of
moisture in it, lot of water.

29:38.800 --> 29:40.967
One of the biggest challenges
with the dogs is

29:41.000 --> 29:43.667
keeping them hydrated
when it's real cold out.

29:43.700 --> 29:46.400
So feeding them this
does two things.

29:46.433 --> 29:50.433
It gives them something like
a giant popsicle to chew on,

29:50.467 --> 29:53.500
and two, it puts a lot of
water into them.

29:53.533 --> 29:57.333
When we're cutting fish,
all this is costing me
is 10 gallons of fuel,

29:58.500 --> 30:00.633
and a bunch of labour
and a bunch of calories.

30:02.933 --> 30:08.100
Right now we're gonna be
doing about 360 fish.

30:08.133 --> 30:11.000
I have to handle them once
from the fish wheel into
the boat,

30:11.033 --> 30:15.533
and once from the boat into
the tractor, and one more time
onto the rack.

30:15.567 --> 30:19.400
So for every fish I pick up
or catch out of the wheel,

30:19.433 --> 30:22.367
I've got to handle it a
minimum of three times.

30:22.400 --> 30:24.167
You start doing the math,
it's a lot of work.

30:24.900 --> 30:26.667
It's a lot of handling.

30:26.700 --> 30:31.167
And I will say one thing about
fishing season, it definitely
gets you into shape.

30:32.567 --> 30:35.933
I don't have to pay anything
to go to a gym and work out.

30:37.067 --> 30:39.900
My workout's every day here
with these fish.

30:41.633 --> 30:45.333
I don't mind doing this.
It's kind of meditative.

30:45.367 --> 30:50.800
A lot of times,
you can just kinda... I just
tend to go into daydreams,

30:50.833 --> 30:56.633
or I start creating
blueprints of my next project
in my head while I'm working.

30:56.667 --> 30:59.267
It's the best job of
the whole year for me.

30:59.300 --> 31:03.533
I love cutting fish.
I love utilising the resource.

31:03.567 --> 31:07.167
I love providing for myself
and for Kate and my dogs.

31:07.200 --> 31:09.533
And that's a really
satisfying thing for me.

31:12.167 --> 31:15.733
ERIK: What sends people
packing out of Alaska
is their mind.

31:15.767 --> 31:18.133
There's isolation,
there's darkness,

31:18.167 --> 31:21.667
there's inclement weather,
extreme temperatures.

31:23.867 --> 31:25.733
That's what eliminates people.

31:36.233 --> 31:38.167
I'm down here on
Kodiak Island,

31:38.200 --> 31:40.767
hunting
Sitka black-tailed deer.

31:40.800 --> 31:44.500
Live here in this maritime
environment on the ocean,
great eating animal,

31:44.533 --> 31:46.267
lot of fun to hunt.

31:46.300 --> 31:50.367
We don't have much snow yet
here in Kodiak, so most of
the deer are up high, but,

31:50.400 --> 31:52.133
I'm hoping I'm gonna be
able to glass one up

31:52.167 --> 31:54.100
and put a stalk on here
before evening.

31:54.133 --> 31:57.200
The tide's gone out,
and feeling good.

31:57.233 --> 32:00.267
The weather's a little bit
better than it's been
in the last couple days,

32:00.300 --> 32:04.967
and hopefully we'll have some
success to avenge
yesterday's failure.

32:10.333 --> 32:12.100
(WHISPERS)
I just spotted a deer.

32:12.967 --> 32:15.233
It's really far away though.

32:15.267 --> 32:20.900
It's gonna be a real push
if I can get him
before dark, but,

32:20.933 --> 32:24.167
I've never been afraid of
a challenge,
so let's let her rip, huh?

32:28.433 --> 32:33.900
I'm trying to run a little bit
over a mile here up this hill
to intercept him.

32:33.933 --> 32:35.800
I just see one deer up there.

32:36.467 --> 32:37.567
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

32:37.600 --> 32:40.367
It's the only deer
I saw today.

32:40.400 --> 32:44.433
I'm taking a lot of chances
crossing the open, but,

32:44.467 --> 32:46.733
if I'm not aggressive,
I don't have a chance.

32:48.667 --> 32:50.500
Hopefully he's still there.

32:50.533 --> 32:52.367
If he's still there,
we'll be able to see him

32:52.400 --> 32:53.667
right over the top here.

33:19.133 --> 33:21.633
Sounded like a hit.

33:23.167 --> 33:24.600
Yeah, I got him.

33:24.633 --> 33:27.500
I do have visual confirmation.
I can see the white belly
of the deer.

33:27.533 --> 33:29.700
The deer is down.
The deer is dead.

33:30.667 --> 33:32.333
I'm gonna need to rush
over here.

33:32.367 --> 33:34.867
I'm fighting darkness,
I'm fighting tide,

33:34.900 --> 33:37.267
and I've already seen
a couple bears
on this hillside tonight.

33:37.300 --> 33:40.400
So I'm not gonna
slap myself on the back
too much.

33:40.433 --> 33:42.567
I'm gonna get over there,
cut this deer up,
and get home.

33:44.000 --> 33:47.500
I was able to take this nice
young Sitka black-tailed buck.

33:49.367 --> 33:52.967
He's got a spike there.
Young buck.

33:53.000 --> 33:56.167
We got a hole right where
it counts.

33:56.200 --> 33:59.233
A lot of people ask me
why I hunt, why I do this

33:59.267 --> 34:03.567
and why I'm running up
the side of the hill
in the dark here,

34:03.600 --> 34:07.733
tides screwing around,
and bears screwing around
and the weather.

34:07.767 --> 34:11.133
How could you not love
this place? I mean, look out
on the ocean here,

34:12.067 --> 34:13.467
look up in the mountains.

34:14.367 --> 34:16.167
What's better than this?

34:16.200 --> 34:19.767
I'm just gonna go ahead
and leave the skin on here.

34:19.800 --> 34:23.400
It's a natural game bag and
I can skin this out later.

34:23.433 --> 34:26.333
But for right now, I'm just
gonna get off this mountain
in a hurry,

34:26.367 --> 34:29.667
'cause I got to beat any
bears that are gonna
come around.

34:29.700 --> 34:32.267
They're not that fun to
play with in the dark

34:32.300 --> 34:34.733
when you're out on the
hillside by yourself using
a headlamp,

34:35.533 --> 34:36.867
trying to butcher a deer.

34:40.900 --> 34:45.400
I grew up hunting deer,
and just being out here

34:45.433 --> 34:49.000
and smelling this deer
as I butcher it, it takes me
right back to my childhood.

34:51.267 --> 34:53.400
I've butchered a lot of
white tails

34:54.633 --> 34:57.667
in a lot darker conditions
than this. (CHUCKLES)

35:00.767 --> 35:01.867
Well...

35:03.400 --> 35:05.600
That's one
Sitka black-tailed buck

35:06.667 --> 35:08.067
in a backpack,

35:08.833 --> 35:10.000
on the side of a mountain,

35:10.767 --> 35:11.767
above a beach,

35:12.767 --> 35:14.167
a long ways from camp.

35:15.300 --> 35:17.500
There we go.
(CHEERS EXCITEDLY)

35:18.900 --> 35:20.833
We got to... (WHOOSHES)
Go down through all
this brush,

35:20.867 --> 35:22.700
down the side of the hill

35:22.733 --> 35:25.333
and then about 5, 6 miles
down the beach.

35:25.367 --> 35:28.900
So there's only one way
to get there,

35:28.933 --> 35:30.433
that's one foot in front of
the other.

35:31.467 --> 35:32.967
Tally Ho!
Waidmannsheil.

35:37.367 --> 35:38.967
CHIP: There's killers
and there's accomplices.

35:39.000 --> 35:40.700
That's really what this world
boils down to.

35:40.733 --> 35:43.967
It all leads to death.
We have to kill to eat.
That's how it goes.

35:53.500 --> 35:58.167
AGNES: It's real important
for me to teach my girls
all the stuff that I know,

35:58.200 --> 36:00.567
or what I've learned from
my parents, or my aunts,

36:00.600 --> 36:02.500
or my brothers and sisters.

36:04.833 --> 36:08.467
I really like
this cutting board for fish
'cause I can cut

36:08.500 --> 36:12.667
anywhere on the board, and all
the gunk flows that way.

36:12.700 --> 36:15.400
We eat all different kinds of
fish all year,

36:15.433 --> 36:19.833
and there's all different
types of ways we cut them
and prepare them.

36:19.867 --> 36:23.833
After I scale them,
Idi, I try to clean them up
a little bit

36:23.867 --> 36:26.400
because I'm not going to
wash them.

36:26.433 --> 36:30.267
Ooh, this one's fat.
Let me just get the
stomach out.

36:30.300 --> 36:34.267
These are the eggs,
they're the best parts
of the fish.

36:35.367 --> 36:37.300
I still have a lot
to learn, but,

36:37.333 --> 36:40.300
someday, I think I will be
able to manage my own camp,

36:40.333 --> 36:43.200
be able to live the way
my parents, and their parents,

36:43.233 --> 36:46.367
and everybody else
before them did.

36:46.400 --> 36:50.800
My girls have the real
good opportunity to learn
a real lot.

36:50.833 --> 36:54.833
If they don't get it from
someplace like me
or my husband,

36:54.867 --> 36:58.100
they could lose it,
but we're not going to let
that happen.

37:04.833 --> 37:06.967
SUE: They're top predators,
I'm not.

37:07.000 --> 37:10.733
As a human being,
I am bred to be
at total disadvantage

37:10.767 --> 37:11.900
for survival here.

37:19.867 --> 37:23.233
NARRATOR: Six years after
being attacked by a grizzly,

37:23.267 --> 37:26.700
Sue is going head-to-head
with her tundra nemesis.

37:29.967 --> 37:32.000
(WHISPERS) 386.

37:34.733 --> 37:36.700
I'd like to close
the distance more,

37:36.733 --> 37:38.533
but I'm fucking afraid
he's gonna see us.

37:44.100 --> 37:45.100
(COUGHS)

37:46.400 --> 37:49.900
Shit. He heard me cough.
He just turned.

37:49.933 --> 37:53.267
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. Shit.

37:53.300 --> 37:55.500
I gave it away.
He's looking right at us.

38:01.333 --> 38:03.467
I'm getting ready in case
he charges.

38:05.200 --> 38:06.867
First shot's critical.

38:06.900 --> 38:10.667
You're gonna make him mad.
A bear can charge
40 miles an hour.

38:10.700 --> 38:12.733
They are top, top predators.

38:14.233 --> 38:18.900
I can't see him. I lost sight.
I have no fucking clue where
he is.

38:20.000 --> 38:21.000
Oh, shit.

38:23.800 --> 38:24.800
(RIFLE SHOTS)

38:28.900 --> 38:30.100
(RIFLE SHOTS)

38:34.300 --> 38:35.300
I'm shaking.

38:40.500 --> 38:41.833
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

38:47.600 --> 38:49.933
Thank you.
Thank you, brother bear.

38:52.133 --> 38:59.233
That is a big thing for me
to actively pursue a bear.

38:59.267 --> 39:02.967
Proud of myself for doing it
and overcoming some fears,

39:03.000 --> 39:04.633
especially as he was
getting closer.

39:04.667 --> 39:08.533
But I also protected camp.
I did this to protect me,

39:08.567 --> 39:11.800
so my little grandkids could
still visit and see me.

39:12.767 --> 39:14.500
And I really appreciate...

39:15.267 --> 39:16.867
Appreciate the moment.

39:26.533 --> 39:32.833
I'm going fire, just in case.
He could just be
too injured to walk.

39:44.767 --> 39:47.133
Well, here's your kill shot.

39:47.167 --> 39:51.567
This is not a case of let's go
out and get the biggest,
baddest bear on the planet.

39:51.600 --> 39:56.300
This was a case of,
I knew I had a bear that was
coming around through camp,

39:56.333 --> 40:00.400
harassing,
getting into things.

40:00.433 --> 40:04.400
This could very well...
I mean, it's within 5, 6 miles
of my home.

40:05.333 --> 40:06.400
He was headed back there.

40:07.200 --> 40:08.267
This...

40:11.067 --> 40:12.967
...brings back a lot of
memories, man.

40:13.667 --> 40:17.567
This is a mature boar, but...

40:21.233 --> 40:24.900
That can kill you.

40:24.933 --> 40:28.233
I don't take
the taking of life lightly.

40:28.267 --> 40:31.900
I absolutely respect every
single thing about this guy,

40:33.333 --> 40:36.700
and I accepted
a long time ago
that something like this...

40:36.733 --> 40:38.867
I might be the one
laying there. Not him.

40:40.267 --> 40:41.533
Thank you, bear.

40:42.867 --> 40:44.833
Your spirit will not
go to waste.

40:46.267 --> 40:49.033
You'll bring
warmth, nutrition.

40:54.233 --> 40:57.700
I'm grateful for it,
but for perspective,

40:57.733 --> 40:59.833
this is definitely not
the end of the war.

40:59.867 --> 41:03.633
This is one skirmish
in the battle on the Arctic.

41:04.667 --> 41:06.033
It's not over.

41:09.733 --> 41:13.700
ANDY: Life is very physical
when you live out in the bush.

41:13.733 --> 41:17.767
If you're not willing to put
in the physical activity
out here,

41:17.800 --> 41:19.500
you're not gonna do
very well.

(DOGS HOWLING)

41:29.067 --> 41:30.467
What do you think, Prance?

41:32.633 --> 41:35.200
This looks pretty good.

41:35.233 --> 41:38.633
Everybody's gonna get fish
tonight. Ohh, boy.

41:38.667 --> 41:42.400
This is the first fish
of the year for the dogs.

41:42.433 --> 41:47.067
Fish wheel's fishing good,
catching 500, 600
fish a day.

41:47.100 --> 41:50.467
As soon as this fish
starts coming in, we pour
the fish to them.

41:50.500 --> 41:53.500
It's got a lot of good oils,
lot of protein,
lot of fats in it.

41:53.533 --> 41:56.000
It really makes for
healthy animals.

41:56.033 --> 41:59.667
We've got a dog right now.
He's 16 years old
and he's still doing great.

41:59.700 --> 42:04.200
You know, I think living on
this fish their whole life
really extends their life.

42:04.233 --> 42:08.400
Mmm, look at that.
That's going to make you
nice and fat.

42:08.433 --> 42:10.333
ANDY: These fish are
critically important to us.

42:10.367 --> 42:13.033
This is the most important job
of the year for me.

42:13.067 --> 42:16.567
Taking care of our dogs and
making sure they have
high quality food.

42:16.600 --> 42:20.333
It's my job to keep them
in shape, to train them,
and to feed them,

42:20.367 --> 42:22.033
and make sure
that their health is good.

42:22.067 --> 42:26.367
Their job is to do the work
that I ask them to do.

42:28.933 --> 42:31.767
It's about 700 on the rack
right now.

42:31.800 --> 42:34.433
Probably be putting
another 700 on tomorrow.

42:35.033 --> 42:36.633
And, uh...

42:36.667 --> 42:40.500
Now it's just a matter of time
and calories to cut fish,
put fish on the rack.

42:42.433 --> 42:44.600
And get a year's worth
of fish.

42:44.633 --> 42:47.667
And guys like this fat boy
will have food the rest
of the year.

42:47.700 --> 42:49.967
Won't you big guy? Huh?

42:50.900 --> 42:52.200
Gilligan, can you sit?

42:53.367 --> 42:56.267
You're a good sitter.
There you go, fat boy.

43:01.100 --> 43:04.900
It's like a symphony
of slurping up
when it's like this.
