WEBVTT

00:14.681 --> 00:15.515
[door rattles]

00:22.981 --> 00:23.940
What happened?

00:24.024 --> 00:26.234
-Does The Order have him?
-No, but they're after us

00:26.317 --> 00:28.153
-and they want blood.
-We need ideas.

00:28.820 --> 00:30.238
Actually, I think I might have one.

00:34.909 --> 00:35.785
Hi.

00:38.538 --> 00:40.331
-Oh, hell, no.
-You must be joking.

00:42.333 --> 00:43.668
She shouldn't be here.

00:46.838 --> 00:49.090
You got a problem, witchy-poo?

00:49.174 --> 00:53.386
I-- I didn't expect to see a woman here.

00:53.470 --> 00:55.513
It's the 21st century.

00:55.597 --> 00:58.183
-Women can be werewolves.
-Yeah, I know.

00:58.266 --> 00:59.184
It's just...

01:02.896 --> 01:04.522
Nothing. Sorry.

01:06.149 --> 01:07.609
She's here to help.

01:07.692 --> 01:09.319
She's in The Order.

01:09.402 --> 01:10.653
Why should we trust her?

01:10.737 --> 01:13.156
-She's in the room.
-Why should we trust you?

01:13.239 --> 01:15.575
Because I just endured torture
instead of ratting you out.

01:15.658 --> 01:18.161
-Your own people tortured you?
-It's complicated.

01:18.244 --> 01:20.705
-They thought she was a werewolf.
-That's not that complicated.

01:21.289 --> 01:24.959
-She shouldn't be here.
-She can help us find Randall.

01:25.752 --> 01:27.921
I know this divining spell.

01:28.004 --> 01:29.964
It's like a magic compass.

01:30.048 --> 01:32.383
-Do it.
-What? You can't be serious.

01:32.467 --> 01:33.885
I'm always serious.

01:35.470 --> 01:38.098
What if she needs the cerebral fluid
from an unborn baby?

01:38.181 --> 01:39.891
-Have you got some?
-[Lilith] What?

01:40.809 --> 01:43.603
Note to self, werewolves are humorless.

01:50.276 --> 01:52.028
Where's your magic go-bag?

01:52.112 --> 01:54.239
I don't have a “magic go-bag.”

01:55.156 --> 01:57.075
-I have a kit.
-[chuckles]

01:57.158 --> 01:59.994
I'm gonna need something
that's uniquely Randall's.

02:05.750 --> 02:06.751
That's good.

02:12.382 --> 02:14.008
<i>Inveniatur...</i>

02:14.467 --> 02:15.802
Randall Carpio.

02:19.639 --> 02:20.723
Where's the ringing?

02:21.516 --> 02:23.101
Maybe the spell didn't work.

02:24.269 --> 02:25.103
It's working.

02:28.523 --> 02:31.609
-What do you mean, ringing?
-It's like a magical alert for us.

02:32.193 --> 02:35.196
Maybe there's no ringing because
she's helping us, so the magic's good.

02:35.905 --> 02:36.823
Shut up.

02:36.906 --> 02:37.907
Hey!

02:37.991 --> 02:41.870
How can you be so bad at secret societies?
You're in two of them!

02:46.666 --> 02:50.170
Hello, Mr. Carpio.
My name is Dr. Hemmings.

02:51.588 --> 02:53.089
Are you gonna tell me where I am?

02:53.173 --> 02:54.591
My research facility.

02:54.674 --> 02:56.843
You signed up for my study last night.

02:56.926 --> 02:58.094
So, you're the warden?

02:58.636 --> 03:00.847
This isn't a prison.
The test is voluntary.

03:00.930 --> 03:03.057
You and your friend
thought it would be hilarious.

03:03.141 --> 03:04.893
Then, I can leave.

03:05.476 --> 03:06.895
Uh, of course you can.

03:08.271 --> 03:09.272
[thuds]

03:10.523 --> 03:11.816
It's funny, door's locked.

03:12.650 --> 03:14.194
Oh, dear. Not again.

03:15.528 --> 03:17.238
[door squeaks]

03:17.322 --> 03:19.490
Maintenance was supposed
to fix that last week.

03:19.574 --> 03:21.367
Marty, make a note.

03:22.535 --> 03:25.330
[Hemmings] I apologize for that,
but given your inebriated state,

03:25.413 --> 03:27.123
it was probably for the best.

03:27.207 --> 03:28.249
Where's the exit?

03:30.501 --> 03:32.837
Of course,
you waive the 50 dollar honorarium.

03:32.921 --> 03:33.838
I'll survive.

03:35.381 --> 03:36.424
Where's Ruby?

03:36.507 --> 03:40.303
She's already started the protocol.
I guess she couldn't survive.

03:41.763 --> 03:42.639
I want to see her.

03:42.722 --> 03:46.142
Then you can participate or wait outside.

03:47.143 --> 03:47.977
Your choice.

03:48.061 --> 03:50.104
Or are you afraid of needles?

03:52.607 --> 03:53.775
Let's do it.

03:54.400 --> 03:55.610
Excellent. Marty?

04:00.949 --> 04:03.493
-You won't feel a thing.
-What kind of test is this?

04:03.576 --> 04:07.538
I'm developing an implant that enhances
physical performance. Shall we?

04:08.665 --> 04:09.582
Leave it open.

04:25.181 --> 04:27.308
Where are you going?
The door's right there.

04:27.392 --> 04:28.434
The compass says this way.

04:30.645 --> 04:33.356
-This is a total waste of our time.
-Do you have a better idea?

04:33.439 --> 04:36.401
We track down the girl that Randall
was sniffing around last night

04:36.484 --> 04:39.195
and beat the crap out of her
until she tells us what we want to know.

04:39.279 --> 04:40.446
I said better idea.

04:41.322 --> 04:42.532
[sighs]

04:45.618 --> 04:48.121
Sorry about Lilith.
She's nice, once you get to know her.

04:48.788 --> 04:49.664
I'm told.

04:51.040 --> 04:53.251
[scoffs] Don't worry, you get used to it.

04:54.711 --> 04:56.963
Why do you sound
like the voice of experience?

04:58.214 --> 05:01.926
Uh, we had a couple of freshman classes
together. I doubt she remembers me.

05:04.971 --> 05:06.180
Up there.

05:07.015 --> 05:09.100
That's where your magic salad dressing
wants to go?

05:11.352 --> 05:13.730
Hey, whoa, whoa.
You can't just walk in there.

05:14.355 --> 05:16.399
-Sure I can.
-That's not how we do things.

05:16.482 --> 05:17.984
It's how we do things.

05:21.195 --> 05:22.113
What's she doing?

05:22.196 --> 05:23.865
[Hamish] And spoil the surprise?

05:28.703 --> 05:30.705
[door buzzer sounds]

05:33.166 --> 05:34.584
This is a restricted area.

05:35.251 --> 05:37.628
[rising magical sounds]

05:39.797 --> 05:40.757
[Randall] Now what?

05:41.424 --> 05:45.219
A small subcutaneous surgical procedure.
Uh, nothing to worry about.

05:45.762 --> 05:47.680
Marty will give you a general anesthetic.

05:47.764 --> 05:49.515
-[hiss]
-Ow!

05:49.599 --> 05:51.225
What the hell, Marty?

05:51.309 --> 05:52.310
I'm sorry.

05:52.393 --> 05:54.395
[Randall grumbles]

05:55.104 --> 05:56.230
It should’ve knocked him out.

05:57.148 --> 05:59.025
I got a kick-ass metabolism.

06:01.819 --> 06:02.820
-[hiss]
-Ah!

06:04.113 --> 06:06.949
There we go.

06:08.409 --> 06:09.869
Let's get him into surgery.

06:19.253 --> 06:20.838
Dad, I need a ride to fencing!

06:25.676 --> 06:26.511
Dad?

06:35.686 --> 06:36.604
Whoa!

06:51.327 --> 06:52.703
Magic's so cool.

06:56.082 --> 06:57.500
Maddox, put that down.

06:58.918 --> 06:59.836
Uh-oh.

07:01.254 --> 07:02.213
Don't!

07:03.005 --> 07:04.048
Dad?

07:04.424 --> 07:06.134
Get the hell away from my son.

07:10.555 --> 07:12.265
You try anything, I kill him.

07:14.475 --> 07:15.810
Cast a spell...

07:16.477 --> 07:17.728
-I kill him.
-Dad?

07:17.812 --> 07:20.022
It's okay, buddy. It's okay. Stay calm.

07:23.151 --> 07:25.778
-It's like a morgue in here.
-That's an encouraging thought.

07:25.862 --> 07:28.072
[Lilith]
I'm just saying it's going to be easy.

07:28.573 --> 07:29.949
Randall's definitely in here.

07:30.032 --> 07:32.785
If you hadn't murdered the security guard,
maybe we'd have the passcode.

07:33.536 --> 07:35.621
I didn't kill him. He's got a concussion.

07:35.705 --> 07:38.875
-Maybe a little brain damage.
-Just find Randall and get out of here.

07:38.958 --> 07:40.918
[door rattles]

07:41.002 --> 07:41.919
[growls]

07:42.003 --> 07:45.339
This door is actually pretty tough.

07:45.882 --> 07:47.091
-[Hamish grunts]
-Let me do it.

07:47.175 --> 07:49.218
You'd just end up alerting security
to our presence.

07:49.302 --> 07:50.845
You thinking <i>Reseretur?</i>

07:51.637 --> 07:53.473
<i>Mm. Aperiatur </i>would be better.

07:53.931 --> 07:56.309
Or we could try abraca-door-a.
Come on.

08:00.146 --> 08:01.647
<i>Aperiatur.</i>

08:03.024 --> 08:04.817
Okay, that's pretty cool.

08:06.986 --> 08:08.404
What?  It is.

08:11.324 --> 08:14.285
Look, whatever you want, I can get it.

08:15.119 --> 08:18.789
-But you have to release my son.
-You're not in charge here.

08:18.873 --> 08:21.375
He can't help you.
Let him go. Take me.

08:21.959 --> 08:23.002
I let him go,

08:23.586 --> 08:24.670
you betray me.

08:25.671 --> 08:27.882
[Edward]
We'll perform a mirror incantation.

08:27.965 --> 08:29.884
Whatever happens to you, happens to me.

08:34.472 --> 08:35.723
You try anything,

08:36.807 --> 08:39.143
I rip his trachea out.

08:49.195 --> 08:50.780
[both] <i>Ligemur.</i>

08:53.324 --> 08:54.492
-Dad!
-It's okay, bud.

08:55.368 --> 08:59.247
Listen, go next door to the Sandwells.
Pretend like nothing happened, understand?

08:59.330 --> 09:01.707
-Come with me.
-It's okay. I'll be fine. Go. Go.

09:08.381 --> 09:11.717
Now that our lives are entwined,
do you mind telling me your name?

09:12.552 --> 09:13.386
[sniffs]

09:15.763 --> 09:17.014
Jurgen Sawyer.

09:18.266 --> 09:20.142
I see you found my book.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.317
This was the first spell we learned.

09:28.401 --> 09:30.945
-Why would I care?
-Right. Why would you?

09:31.028 --> 09:32.238
She's trying to help--

09:32.321 --> 09:33.364
[Alyssa gasps]

09:33.447 --> 09:34.490
[Jack] Oh, crap.

09:34.949 --> 09:35.825
Sorry.

09:36.826 --> 09:38.202
We don't need magic.

09:41.080 --> 09:42.748
[Jack] That's a lot of ground to cover.

09:42.832 --> 09:45.334
Okay. Me and Alyssa, Jack and Lilith,

09:45.418 --> 09:47.420
that way both groups
have Knight and Order powers.

09:47.503 --> 09:48.713
Try again.

09:48.796 --> 09:49.630
[Hamish sighs]

09:51.132 --> 09:51.966
No!

09:52.049 --> 09:54.802
-That's probably not the best idea.
-Do not kill her.

09:54.885 --> 09:56.345
-I won't.
-No promises!

09:58.431 --> 10:01.517
It's never going to work, you know?
You and Alyssa.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.269
Thanks for the vote of confidence.

10:03.352 --> 10:05.229
Don't take it personally. It's not you.

10:05.313 --> 10:06.522
Well, it's not her.

10:08.566 --> 10:11.694
I can't imagine being in a relationship
with someone on the opposite side.

10:11.777 --> 10:13.863
It's hard enough being in one
with another Knight.

10:13.946 --> 10:15.239
You and Lilith?

10:15.323 --> 10:16.324
Or Randall?

10:16.407 --> 10:18.409
No. And he wishes.

10:19.285 --> 10:20.661
Her name was Cassie.

10:20.745 --> 10:21.746
Classic love story.

10:21.829 --> 10:24.790
Boy meets girl.
Girl turns out to be a werewolf.

10:25.541 --> 10:28.586
Boy agrees to follow girl anywhere,
and girl ends up dead.

10:28.669 --> 10:30.338
-I'm sorry, Hamish.
-Don't be.

10:32.089 --> 10:33.507
Cassie loved being a Knight.

10:34.550 --> 10:36.344
She was totally committed to the cause.

10:37.011 --> 10:38.179
What about you?

10:38.554 --> 10:39.764
I swore an oath.

10:40.348 --> 10:43.684
If you could leave, if there was a way
to get out, would you take it?

10:45.603 --> 10:46.687
Would you?

10:47.438 --> 10:48.356
[thumps on door]

10:48.439 --> 10:50.900
Hey, assholes! Get out of here!

10:50.983 --> 10:52.902
Is that the guy we fought
at the Blade & Chalice?

10:52.985 --> 10:54.570
-[Hamish] Have you seen our friend?
-Yeah!

10:54.654 --> 10:57.615
They're doing shit to him!
They've done shit to all of us.

10:57.698 --> 10:58.824
What kind of shit?

10:58.908 --> 11:00.785
They do-- They do something

11:00.868 --> 11:03.120
and it makes us change.

11:03.204 --> 11:04.705
[groans]

11:04.789 --> 11:06.082
-[Jake] What do they do?
-Ow.

11:06.165 --> 11:08.209
[Hamish] Hang on!
We'll get you out of here.

11:08.292 --> 11:11.295
-What the hell's this place built out of?
-[Jack] Holy shit!

11:11.379 --> 11:13.547
-[Hamish] That looks familiar.
-We gotta find Randall.

11:15.091 --> 11:16.717
[roaring]

11:20.388 --> 11:22.014
[groans]

11:28.270 --> 11:29.230
[whispers] Fuck.

11:44.453 --> 11:46.330
[Hemmings over loudspeaker]
<i>How are you feeling?</i>

11:48.999 --> 11:50.209
Like shit.

11:54.004 --> 11:55.131
Where's Ruby?

11:57.299 --> 11:58.801
[man] <i>You'll see her soon.</i>

11:59.719 --> 12:02.304
<i>On a scale of one to ten,</i>
<i>how much pain do you feel?</i>

12:05.474 --> 12:06.475
[groans]

12:07.560 --> 12:08.728
I don't know.

12:10.896 --> 12:11.939
A one.

12:15.609 --> 12:17.570
You told me I'd see her.

12:18.070 --> 12:21.282
[Hemmings]<i> And you will,</i>
<i>as soon as you complete your trial.</i>

12:24.535 --> 12:25.453
[door opens]

12:27.496 --> 12:31.041
Well, he certainly developed
an attraction for you.

12:32.251 --> 12:33.961
That's what makes my job so easy.

12:36.505 --> 12:38.841
The implant's been in place
for quite a while.

12:39.425 --> 12:40.760
One hour, fifteen minutes.

12:41.385 --> 12:42.303
That's odd.

12:43.012 --> 12:46.182
Usually we'd have seen physical evidence
of transformation by now.

12:46.474 --> 12:48.476
Maybe he has a natural resistance to it.

12:48.726 --> 12:49.560
Or...

12:50.811 --> 12:53.481
you made an error during the incantation.

12:53.564 --> 12:56.108
Or he has a natural inhibitor
that blocks transformations.

12:56.650 --> 12:58.110
We've been over this, Miss Speers.

12:58.194 --> 13:01.113
There is no natural resistance
to transformation magic.

13:02.072 --> 13:03.073
Or any magic.

13:03.574 --> 13:07.286
Okay. Well, then, he's just been
a giant step backwards then, hasn't he?

13:07.745 --> 13:10.998
I mean, you want to make werewolves,
right? Well, now we actually have one

13:11.081 --> 13:13.042
and you can't get him to transform.

13:13.125 --> 13:16.212
So, maybe this <i>saevbacch </i>sigil
isn't the best way to create a monster.

13:16.295 --> 13:18.422
More likely, the sigil you implanted
was compromised.

13:18.506 --> 13:22.009
I triple checked it. The only variable
here is Randall, the subject.

13:23.677 --> 13:24.595
[Ruby clears throat]

13:24.678 --> 13:27.181
We're not going to have an issue
like we did last time, are we?

13:27.264 --> 13:29.058
I told you,
last time was a security breach.

13:29.141 --> 13:31.352
I have no idea
how that other subject escaped.

13:32.353 --> 13:34.438
Expose the subject to an attack scenario.

13:35.481 --> 13:38.067
Maybe heightened adrenaline
will trigger his change.

13:39.860 --> 13:40.694
Marty?

13:41.487 --> 13:42.655
Send in a reject.

13:43.447 --> 13:44.365
<i>Hey!</i>

13:45.699 --> 13:47.201
Last chance to let me out!

13:48.244 --> 13:51.080
[buzzer sounding]

13:54.583 --> 13:55.501
[roars]

13:55.876 --> 13:57.461
Holy shit!

13:58.462 --> 13:59.463
Dude, you okay?

13:59.547 --> 14:01.549
-[snarls]
-Oh, fuck!

14:03.968 --> 14:05.135
[Randall] Dude!

14:07.638 --> 14:09.557
[Randall] Whoa! Come on! Come on!

14:09.640 --> 14:12.268
Stop! I said stop!

14:12.351 --> 14:13.477
[snarling]

14:15.688 --> 14:16.897
[gasps]

14:16.981 --> 14:18.148
[machine beeping]

14:24.280 --> 14:26.866
-What just happened?
-Elevated heart rate,

14:26.949 --> 14:29.618
increased respiration,
body temperature soared.

14:29.702 --> 14:33.080
It's like he started his transformation
and then it just stopped.

14:33.163 --> 14:34.123
That's impossible.

14:34.790 --> 14:37.501
Once they start to transform,
they can't stop.

14:38.502 --> 14:40.462
Apparently, it's not impossible.

14:40.546 --> 14:43.757
Maybe he's using a different kind
of magic, one you've never seen before.

14:43.841 --> 14:45.467
Send in another reject.

14:47.928 --> 14:49.805
Marty, we're going again.

14:50.389 --> 14:52.725
[buzzer sounding]

14:56.228 --> 14:57.104
[cellphone beeps]

15:01.358 --> 15:02.443
[Lilith] They find him?

15:03.235 --> 15:04.695
He just asked the same thing.

15:07.948 --> 15:09.491
How's your archaeology program?

15:10.910 --> 15:12.828
I dropped that, like, a year ago.

15:17.416 --> 15:19.710
[Lilith] How did you know
I was interested in archaeology?

15:20.711 --> 15:23.130
You must have mentioned it
when we were in freshmen year.

15:23.213 --> 15:24.798
We never took a class together.

15:26.800 --> 15:27.843
[Alyssa sighs]

15:27.927 --> 15:31.847
You know, those lecture halls
are so big and full of students.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.807
It's hard to keep track of everyone,
you know?

15:33.891 --> 15:35.559
Yeah, I do.

15:36.185 --> 15:38.354
I also know
that we never took a class together.

15:39.396 --> 15:41.440
We need to keep looking for your friend.

15:41.523 --> 15:45.277
[Lilith] That's another thing.
Why are you so hell-bent on helping us?

15:45.361 --> 15:46.904
You're mad at your boyfriend.

15:47.738 --> 15:49.198
He is not my boyfriend.

15:49.281 --> 15:53.077
You don't know Randall or Hamish,
and you sure as shit don't know me.

15:53.619 --> 15:55.955
You know,
maybe I'm just a nice person, Lily-Bell.

16:00.334 --> 16:02.628
The only person to call me Lily-Bell
was my grandmother.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.880
You want to tell me where you heard that?

16:05.464 --> 16:06.632
Not really.

16:08.175 --> 16:10.886
Do you want me to disembowel you
right here in this creepy science lab?

16:10.970 --> 16:12.054
Not really.

16:15.140 --> 16:18.394
[sighs] You love cotton candy,
but only if it's from a carnival.

16:18.477 --> 16:21.522
Your mom used to pinch you on the cheeks
when you were bad.

16:21.605 --> 16:23.232
You had a pet rabbit,
and when you were ten,

16:23.315 --> 16:25.109
you found it
frozen stiff after a cold night,

16:25.192 --> 16:27.486
and you never let yourself
have another pet.

16:31.573 --> 16:32.408
[scoffs]

16:35.160 --> 16:36.328
You almost had me.

16:37.079 --> 16:38.664
How did you do that?

16:38.747 --> 16:41.125
You do some kind of magical memory scan?

16:41.208 --> 16:43.669
Did you knock me out
and get me to tell you all of that?

16:43.752 --> 16:47.256
[scoffs] I know that because we
used to be in The Order together.

16:50.551 --> 16:53.053
I've been trapped inside that book...

16:53.846 --> 16:55.055
for 70 years.

16:56.181 --> 16:57.599
Then you'll want to be on your way.

16:58.017 --> 16:58.851
Mm.

16:59.768 --> 17:00.728
[Jurgen chuckles]

17:18.620 --> 17:20.622
-It's not complete.
-I'm aware.

17:21.331 --> 17:24.460
[sighs] That's why I've been so weak.

17:27.046 --> 17:28.422
The missing piece.

17:30.883 --> 17:33.635
-Perhaps you'd like to help me find it.
-[Jurgen laughs]

17:34.803 --> 17:36.388
You'll probably never finish.

17:37.347 --> 17:39.141
Always one step behind.

17:41.226 --> 17:43.604
You covet the <i>Vade Maecum...</i>

17:46.065 --> 17:48.776
but what do you actually know about it?

17:49.526 --> 17:52.321
It's the most powerful incantation
ever created.

17:53.864 --> 17:56.450
It grants its practitioner
unlimited power.

17:56.950 --> 17:57.910
Wrong.

17:58.619 --> 18:01.997
The Vade Maecum doesn't grant power.
It is power.

18:02.081 --> 18:05.084
And it's not an incantation.
It's a contract.

18:05.167 --> 18:07.169
Which you obviously failed to uphold.

18:07.252 --> 18:08.879
I was this close to finishing...

18:09.838 --> 18:11.090
before I was betrayed.

18:11.590 --> 18:12.549
By who?

18:13.675 --> 18:15.260
It's "whom."

18:16.095 --> 18:19.223
And they call themselves
The Knights of Saint Christopher.

18:21.600 --> 18:22.518
Really?

18:25.062 --> 18:26.605
Self-righteous zealots.

18:27.981 --> 18:31.568
They hate the <i>Vade Maecum.</i>
They'd destroy it if they could.

18:32.277 --> 18:35.906
They could never fully grasp
the book's potential.

18:35.989 --> 18:39.493
The Knights of Saint Christopher.
They're werewolves, aren't they?

18:40.202 --> 18:41.203
They are.

18:41.912 --> 18:43.872
[Edward]
And how did they trap you inside the book?

18:43.956 --> 18:47.835
Oh, please, that wasn't them.
That was blind luck.

18:50.462 --> 18:52.381
To finish the <i>Vade Maecum...</i>

18:53.382 --> 18:55.425
you must become one with the book.

18:56.552 --> 18:59.513
When they tore the book apart,
they tore me apart.

19:00.597 --> 19:02.349
So, the book requires a cleansing.

19:03.517 --> 19:07.354
If we can transfer my essence into
another vessel, the book will be cleansed.

19:07.855 --> 19:09.148
And I'll be free.

19:11.191 --> 19:13.152
And, of course, you won't betray me...

19:14.278 --> 19:15.737
when you get that new body.

19:16.947 --> 19:19.825
We're bound together now, aren't we?

19:20.450 --> 19:21.785
Even if I wanted to,

19:22.202 --> 19:26.081
I wouldn't have the wherewithal
to make another attempt for a long time.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.625
You free me and the book is yours.

19:29.751 --> 19:31.712
I don't know a possession magic.

19:32.588 --> 19:34.381
Provide me with a body...

19:34.965 --> 19:36.049
Hm.

19:36.133 --> 19:36.967
[sniffs]

19:37.801 --> 19:39.219
I'll talk you through it.

19:44.141 --> 19:45.851
-We found the gold coins together.
-Bullshit!

19:45.934 --> 19:47.477
We were promoted
to Medicum at the same time.

19:47.561 --> 19:49.271
-Bullshit!
-Everything okay, ladies?

19:49.354 --> 19:50.480
-We're fine!
-Fine!

19:50.564 --> 19:53.400
Let's just find Randall
and get the fuck out of here.

19:54.276 --> 19:56.236
-Be careful.
-Yeah, you, too.

19:58.280 --> 19:59.573
Are you sure you're okay?

20:00.199 --> 20:02.159
-I still outrank you, you know.
-Mm-hmm.

20:03.577 --> 20:04.828
I already searched down there.

20:07.915 --> 20:09.166
Yeah. I know.

20:11.001 --> 20:13.170
[buzzer sounding]

20:13.253 --> 20:14.880
-[roars]
-[Randall] Stop!

20:14.963 --> 20:16.673
-[snarling]
-Please, stop!

20:19.051 --> 20:21.053
[panting]

20:24.348 --> 20:25.641
[groans]

20:32.231 --> 20:34.316
<i>I don't want to do this anymore.</i>

20:36.360 --> 20:37.569
Four times.

20:38.737 --> 20:41.865
Four interrupted transformations.

20:44.076 --> 20:45.452
How is he controlling them?

20:47.037 --> 20:49.790
[Hemmings] <i>Can you rate your anger</i>
<i>on a scale of one to ten?</i>

20:49.873 --> 20:50.832
Fuck you!

20:51.833 --> 20:53.085
How about that?

20:54.753 --> 20:55.671
Fascinating.

20:56.630 --> 20:57.923
Even with increased aggression,

20:58.006 --> 21:01.802
the subject is able to repress
any full-scale transformation.

21:01.885 --> 21:03.845
He should be a monster by now.

21:05.264 --> 21:06.556
Maybe he studies yoga.

21:10.352 --> 21:11.728
We need to push him to his limit.

21:12.271 --> 21:14.606
Find something
that will push him over the edge.

21:15.023 --> 21:16.191
[Ruby] Yeah, good luck.

21:22.364 --> 21:23.949
Marty, can you come in here, please?

21:30.038 --> 21:31.123
[buzzer sounding]

21:31.206 --> 21:33.709
-Oh, come on!
-[door opens]

21:33.792 --> 21:35.460
[Ruby] Ah.

21:36.128 --> 21:37.796
Ruby? Ruby.

21:38.797 --> 21:40.007
Thank God, you're okay.

21:40.590 --> 21:43.135
-Look, Randall...
-You're okay.

21:44.261 --> 21:45.929
But don't look at them.

21:46.430 --> 21:48.598
They didn't hurt you?
They didn't do anything to you?

21:48.682 --> 21:49.599
No, I'm fine.

21:50.183 --> 21:51.518
Let me see the back of your neck.

21:54.730 --> 21:56.940
Okay, great. That's great.

21:57.024 --> 21:59.151
Listen to me. Look at me.
We're going to be okay.

21:59.234 --> 22:01.236
We're going to get out of here,
I promise.

22:01.320 --> 22:02.195
Now...

22:03.196 --> 22:05.324
Do you see any exits?
Do you know any people who work here?

22:05.407 --> 22:06.450
I don't know. I don't know.

22:06.533 --> 22:08.201
Okay, that's okay. That's okay.

22:08.285 --> 22:09.745
[Hemmings] <i>Ruby, don't be shy.</i>

22:10.370 --> 22:14.374
<i>She knows everything about this place,</i>
<i>Mr. Carpio.</i> <i>She's my assistant.</i>

22:15.334 --> 22:16.168
That--

22:17.461 --> 22:20.005
No, that-- that doesn't make any sense.

22:20.505 --> 22:22.090
<i>Ruby is the reason you're here.</i>

22:23.467 --> 22:25.510
He's lying. Right?

22:27.220 --> 22:28.221
I'm sorry.

22:32.059 --> 22:34.186
<i>All of those people who are dead--</i>

22:34.269 --> 22:35.354
Shut up!

22:35.437 --> 22:38.315
<i>-All of those people you've killed.</i>
-Shut up!

22:38.398 --> 22:40.942
Try to breathe, just calm down.
Just try to breathe.

22:41.026 --> 22:42.903
[roars]

22:42.986 --> 22:44.654
-[Randall roars]
-[Ruby screams]

22:44.738 --> 22:46.281
Oh, jeez.

22:46.865 --> 22:49.409
[Hemmings] Imagine
an army of these under our control.

22:49.493 --> 22:51.912
No one will dare challenge
the Grand Magus.

22:52.746 --> 22:54.831
Secure the subject and collect samples.

22:55.207 --> 22:56.249
[beep]

22:56.333 --> 22:57.876
[hissing]

22:59.586 --> 23:00.962
[roaring]

23:10.597 --> 23:12.224
Lilith was in The Order?

23:12.808 --> 23:14.309
Why is that so hard to believe?

23:14.393 --> 23:16.478
Have you met Lilith?
I mean, of course you have,

23:16.561 --> 23:18.939
but she just hates magic so much.

23:19.022 --> 23:22.067
I can't picture her wanting
to have anything to do with them.

23:22.150 --> 23:23.610
She was good, really good.

23:24.152 --> 23:27.489
-Why'd she get bounced?
-That's actually none of your business.

23:27.572 --> 23:29.366
I am still a member of The Order.

23:29.908 --> 23:31.034
[Alyssa] You weren't then.

23:31.118 --> 23:32.994
So, what?
I'm not authorized to know the history?

23:33.078 --> 23:34.371
Not yet, Acolyte.

23:35.747 --> 23:37.541
Were you the one that powdered her memory?

23:39.668 --> 23:41.044
Is that why you let me off?

23:42.003 --> 23:42.879
[scoffs]

23:42.963 --> 23:44.840
You know it's not all about you, right?

23:44.923 --> 23:45.799
[door opens]

23:46.675 --> 23:49.469
Dude, you are not gonna believe
what just happened to Ruby.

23:49.553 --> 23:50.846
[beeping]

23:50.929 --> 23:51.763
Yeah.

23:52.389 --> 23:55.058
-You guys aren't supposed to be here.
-[Jack] Well... uh...

23:56.435 --> 23:57.310
[coughs]

23:59.771 --> 24:02.774
-You are quick with that stuff.
-Not quick enough sometimes.

24:04.025 --> 24:05.152
So, you regret it.

24:06.319 --> 24:07.571
Can we just find Randall?

24:10.866 --> 24:12.200
[sighs]

24:15.078 --> 24:16.746
[Jack] <i>Aperiatur.</i>

24:21.251 --> 24:24.129
It must be the werewolf in you
that makes spells stronger.

24:24.588 --> 24:26.631
Too bad the Knights
don't like when I use magic.

24:27.215 --> 24:29.342
From my experience,
it's other practitioners they hate.

24:29.634 --> 24:31.261
Depends on how they're using it.

24:34.055 --> 24:35.807
-There's nothing in here.
-Hang on.

24:39.603 --> 24:40.896
[Alyssa] That's not good.

24:41.813 --> 24:43.148
We gotta find that room.

24:48.153 --> 24:51.031
[male voice] I was hoping for someone
who actually shaves.

24:52.824 --> 24:55.619
[Edward] This was the best I could do
on such short notice.

24:55.702 --> 24:56.578
[sniffs]

24:58.371 --> 24:59.331
This will do.

25:02.667 --> 25:03.919
You have your new body.

25:04.461 --> 25:06.296
Now, release your claim to the book.

25:07.005 --> 25:09.090
It was done
the moment you gave me this body.

25:09.299 --> 25:10.926
And our binding spell.

25:11.009 --> 25:12.135
I think not.

25:12.219 --> 25:13.053
[sniffs]

25:15.055 --> 25:18.308
My last body failed, but this body won't.

25:23.605 --> 25:25.565
Thank you for this second chance.

25:27.108 --> 25:29.653
[Jurgen] Ah, ah, ah, ah!
Remember the mirror incantation.

25:30.737 --> 25:33.073
You hurt me, you're only hurting yourself.

25:34.824 --> 25:35.867
Exactly.

See?

26:08.817 --> 26:09.943
[panting]

26:10.569 --> 26:12.988
Here's the thing
about a mirror incantation.

26:13.071 --> 26:14.531
It only mimics the injuries.

26:15.031 --> 26:16.866
It doesn't guarantee certain death.

26:18.451 --> 26:20.453
You never should have threatened my son.

26:21.037 --> 26:22.497
You killed yourself...

26:23.498 --> 26:24.541
[groans]

26:25.125 --> 26:26.251
...for petty revenge?

26:26.334 --> 26:27.419

[Alyssa] <i>Aperiatur.</i>

Randall?

26:45.979 --> 26:46.896
Hey.

26:47.355 --> 26:50.650
-Hey, I know you.
-[Jack] Come on, buddy.

26:50.734 --> 26:52.694
-We got to get you out of here.

26:54.696 --> 26:57.198
-[Jack] What the hell did they do to you?
-[groans]

26:57.282 --> 26:59.159
[Randall] And I know you.

26:59.242 --> 27:02.579
Oh, you guys worked things out. So great.

27:02.662 --> 27:05.081
It's a work in progress, buddy.
Come on, let's go.

27:05.165 --> 27:06.249
[Randall groans]

27:08.335 --> 27:11.630
[Randall] Oh, no. No, Ruby, no.

27:11.713 --> 27:15.133
-[Jack] Come on, we gotta get out of here.
-No. They're all dead because of me!

27:15.216 --> 27:16.718
Where are you going?

27:16.801 --> 27:18.637
To find Dr. Asshole.

27:19.262 --> 27:20.597
[panting]

27:20.680 --> 27:23.016
You want everything
the <i>Vade Maecum</i> offers...

27:24.976 --> 27:27.312
but you'll never be able to pay the price.

27:27.395 --> 27:29.147
You can die thinking that.

27:29.230 --> 27:32.317
You will never be able
to sacrifice your son.

Magus?

28:14.567 --> 28:15.402
Magus?

28:19.114 --> 28:20.198
What happened?

28:22.701 --> 28:24.035
[Edward gasps]

28:24.119 --> 28:25.745
You saved my life, kid.

28:26.830 --> 28:28.039
That's what happened.

28:28.790 --> 28:29.749
[grunts]

28:34.212 --> 28:35.839
Help me clean up this mess,

28:36.715 --> 28:38.466
and I'll buy you an island.

[Jack] <i>Aperiatur.</i>

28:44.723 --> 28:45.849

29:02.782 --> 29:04.576
This is a <i>saevbacch</i> sigil.

29:06.619 --> 29:08.538
It amplifies a person's anger.

29:09.122 --> 29:12.459
The berserkers would tattoo it on the back
of their necks before going into battle.

29:15.503 --> 29:19.924
[Alyssa] This incantation increases
your strength for short periods of time.

29:22.635 --> 29:26.306
If I'm reading this right,
this potion creates an insatiable hunger.

29:27.682 --> 29:29.142
[Randall] He's mixing magic.

29:31.019 --> 29:32.061
Why?

29:32.979 --> 29:34.355
To create monsters.

29:36.274 --> 29:38.067
Magus, it's Hemmings.

29:38.151 --> 29:40.403
Give me a call
me as soon as you get this.

29:41.446 --> 29:44.532
I think I've come up with a solution
to your werewolf problem.

29:47.285 --> 29:48.578

Guys, can I have a minute?

29:56.252 --> 29:57.504
Patient doctor privilege.

29:57.587 --> 29:59.047
Medicum, Acolyte, protect me.

29:59.589 --> 30:00.840
I gave you an order!

30:18.817 --> 30:20.819
You asshole. Don't do that again.

30:21.736 --> 30:22.779
Missed you, too, Lil.

30:25.406 --> 30:27.909
-[Hamish] Everyone, back to the Den.
-Even her?

30:27.992 --> 30:28.993
Especially her.

30:29.452 --> 30:31.412
I could destroy you
with a snap of my fingers.

30:32.038 --> 30:33.790
She can't. Not yet.

30:34.415 --> 30:37.210
You know as well as I do,
we need to talk about this.

30:44.259 --> 30:45.969
We can't just leave that mess back there.

30:49.347 --> 30:51.224
<i>Inflammetur. </i>Try it.

30:51.641 --> 30:53.142

31:04.779 --> 31:05.613
No, thanks.

31:05.697 --> 31:08.366
-You never pass up an après-kill drink.
-I'm not in the mood.

31:08.449 --> 31:09.409
Après-kill?

31:09.492 --> 31:11.953
You have your traditions, we have ours.

31:12.036 --> 31:15.748
Yeah, we have après-kill,
and you kill innocent people.

31:16.165 --> 31:17.750
That was an Order-backed operation?

31:18.084 --> 31:20.628
Doing a bang-up job
with your undercover work there, buddy.

31:20.712 --> 31:24.215
-I have never even seen that guy before.
-No one's blaming you, Jack.

31:24.299 --> 31:26.676
Hemmings went rogue.
It's the only explanation.

31:26.759 --> 31:27.760
[Randall] Of course!

31:28.219 --> 31:31.139
Because The Order isn't inherently evil.

31:31.222 --> 31:33.516
-My order would never sanction that.
-Right.

31:33.600 --> 31:35.351
They only torture people in a fun way.

31:35.435 --> 31:36.269
[scoffs]

31:36.352 --> 31:37.854
So, now torture bothers you?

31:38.313 --> 31:39.522
What's that supposed to mean?

31:39.898 --> 31:42.317
You're not the least bit curious
as to why you were kicked out?

31:43.735 --> 31:45.320
Wait, you two know each other?

31:46.696 --> 31:47.780
Lilith was in The Order.

31:48.656 --> 31:49.532
Is that true?

31:50.783 --> 31:51.618
Hey!

31:52.619 --> 31:55.163
Is that true? Are you one of them?

31:55.580 --> 31:56.706
Them?

31:56.789 --> 31:59.500
-Randall, just dial it down a notch.
-If it wasn't for us,

31:59.584 --> 32:01.753
you'd be another one
of their fucking drones.

32:01.836 --> 32:04.255
I thought they were trying to make
a difference, do something good.

32:04.339 --> 32:06.382
-We are!
-I never should've made you a knight.

32:06.466 --> 32:08.676
-No, you probably shouldn't have.
-Can we focus?

32:09.552 --> 32:11.721
You murdered
a high-ranking member tonight.

32:11.804 --> 32:12.805
\They're going to be coming for you.

32:12.889 --> 32:14.724
Can we just kill her
and get it over with already?

32:14.807 --> 32:16.100
Is that your answer for everything?

32:16.184 --> 32:18.394
-Yes.
-No one is killing anyone else tonight.

32:18.478 --> 32:21.230
-Hey, how about you let me call the shots?
-Can you make a decision

32:21.314 --> 32:23.650
-without resorting to beer pong?
-I'm not resorting.

32:23.733 --> 32:27.570
-No, you're an alcoholic.
-I'm an alcohol aficionado.

32:27.654 --> 32:29.489
-I'm leaving.
-You're not going anywhere.

32:30.365 --> 32:31.574
You really want to do this?

32:31.658 --> 32:33.743
Oh, I want to do this.

32:35.286 --> 32:36.579
[Lilith snarls]

32:36.663 --> 32:38.039
Edward Coventry is my father!

32:44.629 --> 32:47.090
You didn't think to tell us
that your father...

32:47.799 --> 32:50.176
is the leader of The fucking Order?

32:50.259 --> 32:52.845
-That's none of your business.
-I trusted you, man!

32:53.721 --> 32:55.723
-You betrayed me.
-I betrayed you?

32:56.140 --> 32:58.101
You turned me into a fucking werewolf!

32:58.184 --> 32:59.894
-That mistake I can fix right now!
-Randall,

32:59.978 --> 33:02.480
I think whatever Hemmings did to you
is still affecting you.

33:02.563 --> 33:03.982
You know what they did to me?

33:04.524 --> 33:07.193
They opened my eyes
to your fucking bullshit.

33:07.276 --> 33:08.194
[Hamish] Randall.

33:10.029 --> 33:12.240
-[yells]
-Shit!

33:12.657 --> 33:14.033
[grunts]

33:14.117 --> 33:15.159
[Jack] Randall!

33:16.953 --> 33:18.621
[grunting]

33:21.958 --> 33:25.003
-[Hamish] A little help?
-What the hell did Hemmings do to him?

33:25.086 --> 33:28.006
The <i>saevbacch</i> sigil.
It's amplifying his rage.

33:28.089 --> 33:30.258
We need to get it out of him
before he loses control!

33:30.341 --> 33:32.051
[growls]

33:37.140 --> 33:38.349
Keep him still.

33:41.978 --> 33:43.980
Sorry about dropping
that whole Order thing on you.

33:44.397 --> 33:47.066
How can you stay with them,
knowing what they're capable of?

33:47.150 --> 33:49.527
Same way you rationalize
murdering people.

33:49.610 --> 33:51.529
Maybe it's stupid,
but it's the first place I felt

33:51.612 --> 33:52.947
like I could just be who I am.

33:53.031 --> 33:55.867
Are you guys seriously talking
about your feelings right now?

33:55.950 --> 33:57.118
We're multitasking!

33:58.494 --> 34:00.913
[roars]

34:00.997 --> 34:02.582
Now would be the time to hurry up!

-[Hamish gasps]

34:14.260 --> 34:15.511
[Randall groans]

34:18.890 --> 34:20.808
Oh, shit.

34:22.060 --> 34:23.978
Did I lose at beer pong again?

34:34.572 --> 34:35.698
[Maddox] Dad!

34:35.782 --> 34:37.575
-In here, buddy.
-Dad!

34:39.160 --> 34:40.203
Hey.

34:42.705 --> 34:43.539
[Edward sighs]

34:44.207 --> 34:45.083
It's okay.

34:46.542 --> 34:47.627
It's okay.

34:47.710 --> 34:48.795
Did he hurt you?

34:50.088 --> 34:52.548
-Not as bad as I hurt him.
-Good.

34:54.592 --> 34:58.012
There's something that I need to talk
to you about. It's really important.

34:58.888 --> 35:01.849
I'll never touch anything
in your office ever again.

35:04.769 --> 35:05.603
Good.

35:07.355 --> 35:08.356
It's not that.

35:09.690 --> 35:11.651
It's going to sound a little scary,

35:11.734 --> 35:13.903
but after today,
I think you can handle it.

35:13.986 --> 35:15.154
What do you want me to do?

35:17.240 --> 35:18.825
I want you to help me...

35:21.577 --> 35:22.870
change the world.

35:33.673 --> 35:35.049
Was I good at it?

35:35.716 --> 35:37.260
You saved me the first year.

35:38.636 --> 35:42.598
I kept messing up spells.
I couldn't cut my hand without fainting.

35:43.307 --> 35:45.434
The Temple Magus hated me.

35:46.936 --> 35:50.273
-But you stuck with me.
-Why'd I get kicked out?

35:51.816 --> 35:54.110
You know how tragedy plus time
equals comedy?

35:54.819 --> 35:55.945
[sighs]

35:56.028 --> 35:58.197
-It's not comedy yet.
-Not yet.

35:58.573 --> 36:00.199
But I could tell you when it is.

36:00.700 --> 36:02.493
No. I'm good.

36:06.789 --> 36:08.583
I think I'm where I'm supposed to be,
anyhow.

36:11.043 --> 36:11.878
Hey.

36:13.296 --> 36:14.463
What's your boss up to?

36:17.758 --> 36:20.178
Edward Coventry isn't the bad guy.

36:21.971 --> 36:24.807
Make sure it stays that way
and we'll be fine.

36:27.768 --> 36:28.769
Hey, guys.

36:32.315 --> 36:35.109
Sorry I tried to kill all of you.

36:35.776 --> 36:37.737
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
about Coventry.

36:37.820 --> 36:41.282
I'm not sorry about anything,
but you're both a couple of assholes.

36:43.576 --> 36:45.119
Sorry I called you both assholes.

36:45.203 --> 36:46.162
[scoffs]

36:48.247 --> 36:50.541
Did you punch me in the face?

36:51.250 --> 36:52.126
Me?

36:52.585 --> 36:53.669
I would never.

36:54.712 --> 36:55.546
Huh.

36:59.592 --> 37:02.345
Well, this has been, uh...

37:02.803 --> 37:03.638
hell.

37:04.263 --> 37:05.514
But I've gotta to go.

37:05.890 --> 37:07.099
I'm not stopping you.

37:08.768 --> 37:10.561
And you thought I was going to kill her.

37:10.770 --> 37:12.146
Oh, I'll walk you home.

37:15.149 --> 37:17.401
[Randall]
Ah, I'm ready for that gimlet now.

37:19.153 --> 37:20.154
Make that two.

37:21.113 --> 37:21.948
On it.

37:27.161 --> 37:29.413
Did you punch me in the face?

37:30.539 --> 37:31.499
You wish.

37:55.523 --> 37:57.775
I thought it was vampires
that need to be invited in.

37:59.735 --> 38:00.736
You want me to come in?

38:01.320 --> 38:03.072
I wanted you to pick a side...

38:04.365 --> 38:06.117
but I think you already have.

38:06.200 --> 38:08.452
-Alyssa...
-It's okay.

38:09.161 --> 38:11.998
You've got a bond with them
that The Order will 

38:12.081 --> 38:13.624
never give you.

38:14.500 --> 38:15.668
[Alyssa] I understand that.

38:15.751 --> 38:17.837
It's not just about what I have with them.

38:19.088 --> 38:20.881
Hemmings is one person.

38:21.632 --> 38:23.801
-He isn't The Order.
-I know.

38:24.218 --> 38:26.137
I have seen the good side, too.

38:26.220 --> 38:28.639
It isn't enough though, is it?

38:29.181 --> 38:30.516
Not with the whole...

38:31.475 --> 38:33.602
"Edward is your dad" thing.

38:34.186 --> 38:35.521
I should have told you sooner.

38:36.314 --> 38:37.815
Why haven't you told him?

38:38.983 --> 38:40.401
Tell him what?

38:41.527 --> 38:44.196
That he magicked some girl
and forgot about her?

38:45.239 --> 38:46.949
That she never got over it?

38:48.242 --> 38:50.911
That she killed herself because of him?

38:52.955 --> 38:57.209
Or that I've spent
my whole life hating him?

38:58.544 --> 39:01.672
I'm sorry that that happened to her.

39:04.008 --> 39:05.051
And to you.

39:06.969 --> 39:07.803
[sighs]

39:08.262 --> 39:11.057
But if we can't forgive,
how can we hope to move on?

39:12.099 --> 39:15.519
-Could you get past it?
-I would like to think that I would try.

39:17.396 --> 39:22.026
Just like I'm trying to believe
that you didn't want to lie to me.

39:57.937 --> 39:58.979
I can't.

40:01.357 --> 40:02.400
I'm sorry.

40:05.319 --> 40:06.946
We're on opposite sides.

40:09.782 --> 40:11.117
Maybe we don't have to be.

40:14.078 --> 40:15.704
Maybe we always were.

40:25.631 --> 40:26.674
[sighs]

40:30.094 --> 40:31.137
I'd better go...

40:33.305 --> 40:34.974
before I try and kiss you again.

40:38.436 --> 40:39.353
Yeah.

41:04.962 --> 41:06.672
You're an idiot, Jack.

41:17.016 --> 41:18.309
[knocking]

41:22.771 --> 41:24.190
I'm so glad that you--

41:24.273 --> 41:25.941
Come with me. We have work to do.

41:48.923 --> 41:50.591
[engine starts]

41:50.674 --> 41:52.426
[car accelerates]
