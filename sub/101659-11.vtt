DR. REZNICK:
What were you doing
ten years ago?

05:01.902 --> 05:03.003
That's how long
it's been

05:03.136 --> 05:05.105
since the aneurysm
in her brain ruptured

05:05.238 --> 05:07.307
and how long Elias
has been visiting,

05:07.441 --> 05:08.609
bringing her
Peppermint Patties

05:08.742 --> 05:09.910
and hoping
for that special day

05:10.043 --> 05:11.445
she opens her eyes
and says,

05:11.579 --> 05:12.813
"Hi, honey.
Did I sleep in?"

05:12.946 --> 05:14.081
And I had
finally gotten him

05:14.214 --> 05:15.248
to give that up.

05:15.383 --> 05:16.450
Give up hope?

05:16.584 --> 05:18.118
Give up
an impossible fantasy

05:18.251 --> 05:19.587
that has paralyzed
his life.

05:19.720 --> 05:22.756
He used to have a career,
goals, a wife,

05:22.890 --> 05:25.292
things he can have again
if we let him move on.

05:25.426 --> 05:26.994
And by "we," I mean you.

05:27.127 --> 05:29.262
So you are gonna tell him
that the twitch meant nothing.

05:29.397 --> 05:30.931
But she has elevated levels
of dopamine.

05:31.064 --> 05:32.065
Which is a stress hormone,

05:32.199 --> 05:33.300
likely produced
by the adrenal

05:33.434 --> 05:34.535
when it was temporarily
shut down.

05:36.069 --> 05:38.506
But it's also
a neurotransmitter
in the brain

05:38.639 --> 05:42.175
and may be associated
with increased brain activity.

05:42.309 --> 05:44.678
We need to do a SPECT-CT
of her brain and full body

05:44.812 --> 05:46.814

the source of the dopamine.

11:16.443 --> 11:19.679
You could say we're doing
a kind of Humpty Dumpty,

11:19.813 --> 11:20.981
only this time,

11:21.114 --> 11:24.017

going to put you

11:24.151 --> 11:25.552
Don't get too excited,

11:25.685 --> 11:27.387
Dr. Andrews
wants to give us
a little reality check.

11:28.421 --> 11:29.890
If all goes well,

11:30.023 --> 11:31.925
you'll have
a restricted range
of motion

11:32.059 --> 11:33.126
and be dependent
on a walker.

11:35.062 --> 11:37.898
If all doesn't go well,
there is a risk of paralysis

11:38.031 --> 11:40.267
and, given the potential
for massive blood loss,

11:40.400 --> 11:44.037
there's a small chance you
might not survive the surgery.

11:45.672 --> 11:47.707

11:47.841 --> 11:50.143

the top neurosurgeons
in the world.

11:51.812 --> 11:53.213
So, what do you say?

11:54.281 --> 11:55.949

of increased brain activity.

12:28.681 --> 12:30.918

to the tumor
irritating her nerves.

What about this cancer?
Is it treatable?

12:40.160 --> 12:42.162
The only treatment
would be surgery,

12:42.295 --> 12:43.696
and it's in
a difficult location.

12:43.831 --> 12:44.898
Well, what happens
if you don't remove it?

12:45.032 --> 12:46.766

12:46.900 --> 12:48.568
Dannie would die
within a couple of months.

12:48.701 --> 12:49.937
Then you have to operate.

12:50.070 --> 12:51.404
She could die
in the O.R.

12:51.538 --> 12:54.207
rather than here
with you holding her hand.

12:55.308 --> 12:57.077

There's no change.

12:57.210 --> 12:58.211
There was a change.

12:59.346 --> 13:01.314
Uh, the thumb movement
was a change.

13:01.448 --> 13:03.283
And the cancer
and the dopamine
were changes.

13:03.416 --> 13:04.784
Something else
could change,

13:04.918 --> 13:07.087

that'll wake her up.

his baseball card.

14:09.116 --> 14:11.284
Your dad ever tell you
about his story?

14:12.953 --> 14:16.656
First person
to recognize his talent
was a prison guard.

14:16.789 --> 14:19.359
He helped him
get out of prison
a year early on parole

14:19.492 --> 14:21.294
so he could play
professional baseball.

14:25.232 --> 14:27.300

Gates Brown a lot.

he didn't live up
to expectations?

he wasn't good enough
for the bigs?

14:52.792 --> 14:55.228
But he kept fighting.
He kept pushing.

but you still fail?

at yourself in the mirror

the dopamine

showed over
1,200 nanograms per liter.

in dopamine,

24:18.424 --> 24:19.792

MC: That was tight.
Everyone give it up
for Travers!

37:53.505 --> 37:55.273
(APPLAUSE)

37:57.175 --> 37:59.077
Next up is...

37:59.210 --> 38:00.312
Claire.

38:01.079 --> 38:02.280
(SIGHS)

38:02.414 --> 38:04.550
Hey, you got this.

38:08.587 --> 38:09.721
Okay.

38:14.426 --> 38:18.229
Um, this is a song my...
My mother taught me.

38:18.364 --> 38:22.100
So if you don't like it,
shame on you.

38:22.233 --> 38:23.301
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

38:31.142 --> 38:34.245
(CROWDED TABLE PLAYS)

38:34.380 --> 38:38.249
****

38:44.790 --> 38:48.560
** You can hold my hand

38:48.694 --> 38:51.663
** If you need to let go

38:51.797 --> 38:55.501
** I can be your mountain

38:55.634 --> 38:58.670
** When you're
feeling valley-low

39:00.439 --> 39:06.978
** I want a house
with a crowded table

39:07.112 --> 39:13.785
** And a place by the fire
for everyone

39:13.919 --> 39:17.689
** Let us take on the world

39:17.823 --> 39:21.827
** Like we're young and able

39:21.960 --> 39:28.500
** So bring us all together
when the day is done...

39:30.869 --> 39:32.303
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

39:32.438 --> 39:34.573
I got Jeff's
post-op images.

39:34.706 --> 39:35.707
Everything looks great.

39:36.808 --> 39:37.809
Yeah.

39:39.344 --> 39:40.812
What you did
was phenomenal.

39:42.113 --> 39:43.348
It's got to feel
pretty good.

39:43.482 --> 39:45.651
(SIGHS) Feels great.

39:55.260 --> 39:56.528
Three patients
I turned down.

39:59.431 --> 40:00.999
This world needs more
people screwed up just enough

40:01.132 --> 40:03.234
they think they can
do the impossible.

40:03.368 --> 40:07.338
** Crowded table

40:07.473 --> 40:14.513
** And a place by the fire
for everyone

40:14.646 --> 40:21.252
** Let us take on the world
like we're young and able...

40:21.386 --> 40:22.854
You owe me seven bucks.

40:22.988 --> 40:24.523
This costs $6.

40:24.656 --> 40:25.857
Delivery charge.

40:25.991 --> 40:27.859
I just increased
your rent by $20.

40:28.860 --> 40:31.863
** The door is always open

40:32.898 --> 40:36.568
** Your picture's on my wall

40:36.702 --> 40:39.605
** Everyone's a little broken

40:39.738 --> 40:43.775
** But everyone belongs

40:43.909 --> 40:46.878
** Yes, everyone belongs...

40:49.915 --> 40:52.350
LEA: (LAUGHS)
His face was awesome.

40:52.484 --> 40:56.522
Mostly blind rage
with a sprinkle
of bewilderment.

40:56.655 --> 40:59.257
And how about you
leaping into the car
like the Man of Steel?

40:59.390 --> 41:00.792
I hurt my knee.

41:00.926 --> 41:03.261
Making what you did
even more spectacular.

41:03.394 --> 41:04.830
I can't believe
you stiffed the guy
like that.

41:04.963 --> 41:07.132
I didn't.

41:07.265 --> 41:11.503
I paid him $250,
which is what
he was entitled to,

41:11.637 --> 41:13.338
leaving him with no reason
to retaliate.

41:14.940 --> 41:16.007
That is fair.

41:16.141 --> 41:17.342
(SIGHS)

41:17.475 --> 41:18.610
Lea...

41:21.580 --> 41:23.915
You have been a bit...

41:26.451 --> 41:30.556
...crazy
the last two days,

41:30.689 --> 41:33.091
and I needed to help you
see what was right.

41:35.326 --> 41:37.328
****

41:38.997 --> 41:41.800
I have been a bit crazy.

41:42.968 --> 41:44.936
But it wasn't
really about the car.

41:48.907 --> 41:50.609
Two days ago,
I found out...

41:54.813 --> 41:56.014
Shaun...

41:58.784 --> 42:00.085
I'm pregnant.

42:00.218 --> 42:06.024
** With a crowded table

42:06.157 --> 42:12.731
** And a place by the fire
for everyone

42:12.864 --> 42:16.501
** Let us take on the world

42:16.635 --> 42:20.405
** Like we're young and able
