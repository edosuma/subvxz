04:07.320 --> 04:09.721
I wanna start off
by making it very clear

04:09.723 --> 04:11.655
that I didn't know
any of these girls.

04:11.657 --> 04:14.625
Any of them. I mean, I...

04:14.627 --> 04:16.028
I met them last night,

04:16.029 --> 04:18.665
but I'd never met them
before that.

04:24.838 --> 04:26.971
I read in a crime novel once

04:26.973 --> 04:28.839
that the best way
to question someone

04:28.841 --> 04:31.878
is just to let them
keep talking.

04:33.245 --> 04:35.415
That's what you're doing,
isn't it?

04:37.651 --> 04:39.853
It's totally
what you're doing.

04:43.088 --> 04:45.957
You know what the murder rate is
in Palm Springs, Jackie?

04:45.959 --> 04:47.425
Why would I know that?

04:47.427 --> 04:48.493
Five.

04:48.495 --> 04:49.493
Five per...?

04:49.495 --> 04:50.562
Year.

04:50.564 --> 04:52.331
Wow.

04:52.333 --> 04:53.300
That's really good.

04:54.435 --> 04:56.937
That's like a week in L.A.

04:59.906 --> 05:02.942
Wait,
you think this was a murder?

05:07.014 --> 05:10.081
Tell me about, um...

05:10.083 --> 05:12.849
Starfoxy.

05:12.851 --> 05:15.221
Okay, uh...

05:16.355 --> 05:17.921
We met in college.

05:17.923 --> 05:21.459
Well, Byron, Travis
and myself did.

05:21.461 --> 05:25.529
About a year ago,
we found Kirk on Craigslist.

05:25.531 --> 05:29.567
I guess our manager thought
we needed to "add keys."

05:29.569 --> 05:31.937
I don't know,
he thought the whole Green Day,

05:31.939 --> 05:33.637
power-guitar thing
was getting stale...

05:33.639 --> 05:37.909
Jump ahead. I don't need
the whole discography.

05:40.279 --> 05:43.348
Like when we got
to the house?

05:43.350 --> 05:45.649
Start in the van.

05:45.651 --> 05:47.218
Okay.

05:47.220 --> 05:48.920
Um...

05:48.922 --> 05:52.156
We left L.A. around 9 a.m.

05:52.158 --> 05:55.928
We took the 74 because we knew
everyone else would take the 10.

06:07.807 --> 06:09.440
Okay. Seriously, Jackie,

06:09.442 --> 06:11.642
what the fuck
are we listening to?

06:11.644 --> 06:13.178
Vivaldi.

06:13.180 --> 06:16.548
Thanks, but I was being
rhetorical, as to imply

06:16.550 --> 06:19.416
why the fuck are we listening
to this shit?

06:19.418 --> 06:22.152
Because it's my turn and this
is what I wanna listen to.

06:22.154 --> 06:23.654
You had your turn,

06:23.656 --> 06:25.824
and you made us sit
through Imagine Dragons.

06:25.826 --> 06:28.625
Made you?
Imagine Dragons are awesome.

06:28.627 --> 06:30.529
Imagine Dragons is awesome.

06:30.531 --> 06:31.863
See, Byron agrees.

06:31.865 --> 06:33.264
No,
just correcting your grammar.

06:33.266 --> 06:35.132
Imagine Dragons is terrible.

06:35.134 --> 06:38.702
I thought their first album
was pretty good, so...

06:38.704 --> 06:40.204
Okay, well, this is calming.

06:40.206 --> 06:43.144
We could all use a little calm
right now.

06:44.144 --> 06:46.144
I'll be calm when I'm dead.

06:46.146 --> 06:50.781
This weekend
is about partying, okay?

06:50.783 --> 06:53.319
Shit,
we should be pre-gaming now.

06:55.288 --> 06:57.322
I wanted to talk to you guys
about that.

06:57.324 --> 06:59.024
Sounds like
we're in trouble.

06:59.026 --> 07:00.591
I think we can all agree

07:00.593 --> 07:02.728
that this weekend
is very important for us.

07:02.730 --> 07:04.930
So let's skip
the festival today

07:04.932 --> 07:06.632
and just go straight
to the house.

07:06.634 --> 07:09.968
Heh. Fuck that.
We've got artists' passes,

07:09.970 --> 07:12.236
- and we're gonna use 'em.
- I second that notion.

07:12.238 --> 07:14.406
I third it.
Those badges cost 800 bucks.

07:14.408 --> 07:16.106
That's more money than
I'm gonna spend on anything

07:16.108 --> 07:17.108
in my entire life.

07:17.110 --> 07:18.676
Okay, okay.

07:18.678 --> 07:21.245
We go to the festival
for a couple of hours

07:21.247 --> 07:23.848
and then we get to the house
before sundown.

07:23.850 --> 07:25.584
Then we party.

07:25.586 --> 07:28.820
No, and then we rehearse.
And call me crazy,

07:28.822 --> 07:31.522
but maybe we actually
go to bed at a decent hour

07:31.524 --> 07:32.789
and get some sleep.

07:32.791 --> 07:35.125
Jackie,
if tomorrow goes well,

07:35.127 --> 07:36.995
we're gonna blow up. Huh?

07:36.997 --> 07:40.098
We're gonna have to get used
to playing to sold-out crowds

07:40.100 --> 07:42.067
after all-night sex
and drug binges.

07:42.069 --> 07:45.735
So we might as well start
to get used to it, huh?

07:45.737 --> 07:49.106
See... I'm confused

07:49.108 --> 07:51.608
because now you're both making
great arguments.

07:51.610 --> 07:53.678
Kirk, it's one night.

07:53.680 --> 07:55.549
Please? Just one night?

07:58.017 --> 07:59.884
All right.

07:59.886 --> 08:04.089
But only if you promise
to party twice as hard tomorrow.

08:04.091 --> 08:05.925
Scout's honor.

08:29.249 --> 08:32.115
I'm gonna check out New
Pollution. What about you guys?

08:32.116 --> 08:34.083
- Wax Battleship.
- Invasion 101.

08:34.086 --> 08:37.722
Every man for himself, then.
So...

08:37.724 --> 08:40.291
Meet back here at 5.

08:40.293 --> 08:42.296
I'll get the door.

like my grandma's house.

09:34.379 --> 09:35.780
Where'd you find it?

09:35.782 --> 09:37.248
Airbnb.

09:37.250 --> 09:39.350
The couple who owns it
lives on the East Coast

09:39.352 --> 09:43.153
- and only uses it in winter.
- What's up with these gnomes?

09:44.758 --> 09:48.258
We are gonna trash the shit
out of this place.

09:50.062 --> 09:52.329
Okay, I was wrong.

09:52.331 --> 09:55.565
My grandma's
definitely not this cool.

09:55.567 --> 09:57.569
Dude, check it out.

09:57.571 --> 09:59.671
One of these Chinese
pinball machines.

09:59.673 --> 10:00.704
Japanese.

10:00.706 --> 10:02.275
Whatever.

10:03.543 --> 10:04.541
Oh.

10:05.544 --> 10:07.046
Yes.

10:15.254 --> 10:18.388
- Could use some jizz.
- Gross.

10:18.390 --> 10:19.958
How are we picking rooms?

10:19.960 --> 10:22.127
First come, first serve,
like on <i>Real World?</i>

10:22.129 --> 10:25.765
Sure. But I found this
place, so I get the master.

11:06.173 --> 11:08.406

Want anything?

11:08.408 --> 11:09.674
- Bourbon.
- Yes. Whiskey.

11:09.676 --> 11:12.042
No. No booze.

11:12.044 --> 11:14.012
Are you fucking kidding me?

11:14.014 --> 11:15.646
Are you fucking kidding?

11:15.648 --> 11:18.517
Do you not remember the
conversation we had in the van?

11:18.519 --> 11:19.883
No partying.

11:19.885 --> 11:22.920
Having a few beers
isn't "partying," Jackie.

11:22.922 --> 11:24.224
It's a gateway.

11:28.260 --> 11:29.730
Oh, hey, grab a pizza.

11:33.033 --> 11:34.898
He's being such a dick
today.

11:34.900 --> 11:36.167
Eh, give him a break.

11:36.169 --> 11:37.569
He's just young and excited.

11:37.571 --> 11:39.369
He's like a kid
on Christmas morning

11:39.371 --> 11:41.808
that just wants
to have a couple beers.

11:43.076 --> 11:44.742
Well...

11:44.744 --> 11:47.078
we can't practice
without him, so...

11:54.453 --> 11:56.387
That's a redo.
Because you hit the net.

11:56.389 --> 11:59.056
- No, that's only on serves.
- No, it's a redo

11:59.058 --> 12:00.724
- any time you hit the net.
- What?

12:00.726 --> 12:04.094
It's only a redo on the serve.
That's the rule.

12:04.096 --> 12:07.698
- In what rule book?
- All of them.

12:07.700 --> 12:08.900
No.

12:08.902 --> 12:10.200
We have arrived.

12:10.202 --> 12:11.969
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:13.371 --> 12:14.638
You didn't get pizza.

12:14.640 --> 12:15.772
We'll order one.

12:17.009 --> 12:18.443
Who are your friends, Kirk?

12:18.445 --> 12:22.213
Uh... This is Maple,
Amber and Lucy.

12:22.215 --> 12:23.681
Lucy.

12:23.683 --> 12:26.550
We met at the liquor store.
They're going

12:26.552 --> 12:28.486
- to the festival too.
- No kidding.

12:28.488 --> 12:32.223
Wow, 75,000 people in town
for the festival

12:32.225 --> 12:33.958
and you bump
into three of them?

12:33.960 --> 12:38.695
Heh. Right? Thank you so much
for inviting us to hang out.

12:38.697 --> 12:41.431
We're staying in this sketchy
hotel in Cathedral City.

12:41.433 --> 12:43.300
I'm pretty sure
there's a meth lab

12:43.302 --> 12:45.469
- in the manager's office.
- Heh.

12:45.471 --> 12:47.972
Oh, my God, what's the address?
I'll make a run.

12:49.741 --> 12:52.108
Hey, Kirk says you guys
are playing tomorrow?

12:52.110 --> 12:53.243
That's so cool.

12:53.245 --> 12:55.345
It is so cool.

12:55.347 --> 12:57.515
Kirk, why don't I help you

12:57.517 --> 13:00.685
take these things
into the kitchen? Okay?

13:00.687 --> 13:02.621
Here you go.

13:02.623 --> 13:04.754
- You guys have a hot tub?
- Yeah, I mean...

13:04.756 --> 13:07.025
It's very small. Over there.

13:07.027 --> 13:10.864
Look, Jackie,
I know you're mad.

13:12.532 --> 13:14.998
They're all chicks.
But, look, calm down.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.536
I'll have them call bros,
we'll get them here.

13:17.538 --> 13:20.204
- We'll figure it all out.
- Huge, Kirk.

13:20.206 --> 13:21.940
Tomorrow is huge for us.

13:21.942 --> 13:24.408
Because "Castles" has had
so much airplay,

13:24.410 --> 13:26.310
there are gonna be a ton
of A&R reps...

13:26.312 --> 13:27.778
If we impress them,

13:27.780 --> 13:29.781
we could get
a three-album deal worth,

13:29.783 --> 13:32.219
what's the number,
half a million dollars, right?

13:33.253 --> 13:35.753
Jackie, I know, okay?

13:35.755 --> 13:37.988
You've told us
like a half a million times.

13:37.990 --> 13:41.758
Listen, I know that you're new
to the whole band thing.

13:41.760 --> 13:43.927
And being on tour
is still fun for you,

13:43.929 --> 13:46.330
but if we don't pull this off
and get signed,

13:46.332 --> 13:48.802
then that is it for me.
Do you understand that?

13:49.970 --> 13:51.234
I'm not gonna spend

13:51.236 --> 13:52.737
another 10 years
driving around

13:52.739 --> 13:54.705
in that shitty van,
waiting for a shot.

13:54.707 --> 13:58.575
This. This, right here,
is my shot.

13:58.577 --> 14:00.277
Which is why
I want them gone.

14:03.884 --> 14:06.884
Look, Jackie.

14:06.886 --> 14:12.055
If you wanna do this whole
Mary Poppins thing all weekend,

14:12.057 --> 14:13.156
go for it.

14:13.158 --> 14:15.229
But the thing is...

14:17.363 --> 14:19.196
you're not my mom.

14:19.198 --> 14:24.334
And I'm gonna chase it tonight,
whether you like it or not.

14:38.418 --> 14:39.717
Hi, how's it going?

14:39.719 --> 14:42.286
Jackie, come pay for this!

14:44.157 --> 14:46.223
Hi. How much?

14:46.225 --> 14:48.925
Forty-two fifty.

14:48.927 --> 14:52.964
Hey, anybody tell you you look
like the dude from <i>American Pie?</i>

14:52.966 --> 14:54.031
Who?

14:54.033 --> 14:55.367
Sherminator.

14:55.369 --> 14:57.935
Oh, because I have red hair?

14:57.937 --> 14:59.070
No.

14:59.072 --> 15:00.872
Oh.

15:00.874 --> 15:01.939
Can I get 10 back?

15:01.941 --> 15:03.708
Oh, yeah. Thank you.

15:03.710 --> 15:06.209
Surprised the Houlbrooks rented
this place out again.

15:06.211 --> 15:08.813
After what happened last year.
Here you go.

15:08.815 --> 15:11.585
Thank you very much for the tip.
Have a good night.

15:13.287 --> 15:15.822
What the fuck happened
last year?

15:17.624 --> 15:22.326
Ahem. So I said,
"Those aren't my pants."

15:23.962 --> 15:26.296
That's why we're not allowed
in Modesto anymore.

15:28.735 --> 15:32.004
So which one of you guys
writes the songs?

15:34.573 --> 15:36.174
We all do.

15:36.176 --> 15:38.776
Well, we all have ideas

15:38.778 --> 15:41.682
and we all contribute,
so we all get credit.

15:42.881 --> 15:45.081
Yeah, but Jackie does
the heavy lifting.

15:45.083 --> 15:46.886
Show 'em the book, Jackie.

15:48.355 --> 15:51.890
Mm. That's so cute.
That reminds me of my journal.

15:51.892 --> 15:54.092
I love to journal,
especially by hand.

15:54.094 --> 15:57.762
It just makes you feel, like,
so much closer to the words.

15:57.764 --> 15:59.566
That makes so much sense.

16:00.799 --> 16:03.066
She's got, like, 200 songs
in this thing.

16:03.068 --> 16:04.669
All of 'em genius.

16:04.671 --> 16:06.403
- Can I see it?
- Sorry.

16:06.405 --> 16:09.073
Mm. Industry secrets.

16:09.075 --> 16:12.509
Yeah, how do we know
you're not spies for Phantogram?

16:12.511 --> 16:13.978
Shit,
they found us out, girls.

16:13.980 --> 16:16.914
We're secretly
sexy female bandits.

16:18.384 --> 16:21.353
Hey, a couple of my friends
are leaving the festival.

16:21.355 --> 16:22.953
They're looking
for something to do.

16:22.955 --> 16:25.089
Is it cool if I tell them
to just come?

16:25.091 --> 16:26.089
Yeah, totally.

16:26.091 --> 16:27.392
No.

16:30.096 --> 16:31.498
The more the merrier.

16:33.500 --> 16:34.900
How many friends?

16:37.037 --> 16:40.238
Just a couple.

16:43.542 --> 16:45.545
Totally! You too.

16:47.614 --> 16:49.781
Know what you need?
You need sunglasses.

16:49.783 --> 16:50.915
Oh.

16:50.917 --> 16:52.583
Has anybody seen
my sunglasses?

16:53.886 --> 16:55.319
<i>♪ I know some things... ♪</i>

17:05.631 --> 17:07.565

17:07.567 --> 17:09.799
Hey, would you like
some coconut water?

17:09.800 --> 17:12.268
I have a whole case
in the fridge.

17:12.270 --> 17:13.738
No, I'm good, thanks.

17:13.740 --> 17:16.141
Okay, well,
remember to stay hydrated.

17:16.143 --> 17:18.545
We are in the desert,
after all.

17:19.877 --> 17:22.845
I'm doing it. I'm doing it.
Oh, my God.

17:30.557 --> 17:33.591
Ooh. Fire pit.

17:33.593 --> 17:35.593
I made you a drink.

17:35.595 --> 17:37.460
Thanks,
but I'm not drinking tonight.

17:37.462 --> 17:38.629
Yeah. Ahem.

17:42.734 --> 17:45.169
I just wanna say that...

17:45.171 --> 17:48.372
I've been a fan of yours
for, like,

17:48.374 --> 17:50.106
a while now.

17:50.108 --> 17:53.611
I'm talking,
like, before this album

17:53.613 --> 17:55.546
that you guys just released,
obviously.

17:55.548 --> 17:58.481
I mean,
like, <i>Section Five,</i> okay?

17:58.483 --> 18:00.851
I'm talking <i>Paper Girl.</i>

18:00.853 --> 18:03.286
Like, I even really dug
that solo EP

18:03.288 --> 18:05.890
- you put out a few years ago.
- Oh, let me guess.

18:05.892 --> 18:09.026
You prefer
the early Starfoxy stuff.

18:09.028 --> 18:13.296
I mean, not to be cliché,
but...

18:13.298 --> 18:14.465
Don't apologize.

18:14.467 --> 18:15.966
I do too.

18:15.968 --> 18:19.135
Are you still writing,
like, solo stuff?

18:19.137 --> 18:21.740
Yeah, actually. Um...

18:23.609 --> 18:25.543
Okay, hold up.

18:25.545 --> 18:27.547
Are you, like, writing
right now?

18:28.780 --> 18:30.680
- Yes.
- Can I hear it?

18:30.682 --> 18:32.883
Oh. It's just a verse
and a chorus.

18:32.885 --> 18:35.989
Oh, no, that's perfect.
I have a short attention span.

19:43.823 --> 19:45.521
Hey, look at me.
I'm Michael Phelps.

19:46.959 --> 19:49.160
Where'd she get
that bathing suit?

19:49.162 --> 19:50.393
Oh, her purse.

19:50.395 --> 19:52.296
She carries a bathing suit
in her purse?

19:52.298 --> 19:55.568
Yeah, for, like, occasions
such as this.

19:56.836 --> 19:58.936
Come on, Jackie, get in.
The water's fine.

19:58.938 --> 20:02.506
Yeah, come on, Jackie.
The water's fine. Heh.

20:02.508 --> 20:04.342
I'm gonna call it a night.

20:04.344 --> 20:05.610
You guys have fun.

20:07.346 --> 20:09.246
Yeah, that's right.

20:09.248 --> 20:11.347
I forgot,
she'll melt if she gets wet.

20:11.349 --> 20:12.615
Aah. Uh-oh.

20:12.617 --> 20:15.120
Ding-dong, the witch is mad.
Heh.

20:21.361 --> 20:22.994
<i>Hey, babe.</i>

20:22.996 --> 20:24.295
Hi.

20:24.297 --> 20:25.595
Thank you for the card.

20:26.699 --> 20:28.298
<i>No problem.</i>

20:28.300 --> 20:30.701
How is Operation
No One Parties Tonight going?

20:30.703 --> 20:32.201
<i>Yeah, it's going great.</i>

20:32.203 --> 20:34.938
We're just sitting around,
drinking kombucha,

20:34.940 --> 20:37.475
playing Settlers of Catan.

20:38.778 --> 20:41.047
I bet you are.

20:42.115 --> 20:44.614
- Getting nervous?
- <i>Getting nervous?</i>

20:44.616 --> 20:48.151
I've been nervous since the day
you got me to agree to this.

20:48.153 --> 20:50.421
So you're gonna lie in bed
all night

20:50.423 --> 20:51.721
just stressing about it

20:51.723 --> 20:53.757
<i>and not get any sleep,
right?</i>

20:53.759 --> 20:56.026
You know me too well.

20:56.028 --> 20:58.327
Take one of your knockout pills,
get some sleep.

20:58.329 --> 21:00.131
You'll thank yourself
in the morning

21:00.133 --> 21:02.165
when you wake up
fresh as a daisy.

21:02.167 --> 21:04.634
That's actually
not a bad idea.

21:04.636 --> 21:06.069
<i>Well, that's what I do.</i>

21:06.071 --> 21:08.205
<i>I come up with good ideas.</i>

21:08.207 --> 21:11.107
Well, you deserve more
than your 15 percent.

21:11.109 --> 21:14.746
Well, I mean, that's...

21:14.748 --> 21:17.748
Shit. Um...
Babe, I gotta take this call.

21:17.750 --> 21:19.682
<i>Um... I love you.</i>

21:19.684 --> 21:21.251
I love you too.

21:21.253 --> 21:22.888
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

21:31.430 --> 21:32.966
I'm coming.

21:35.201 --> 21:36.901
Mm.

21:36.903 --> 21:39.369
Hey. Switch rooms with me.

21:39.371 --> 21:40.837
What?

21:40.839 --> 21:42.107
Why?

21:43.008 --> 21:46.142
Because your bed is bigger.

21:46.144 --> 21:48.211
Are you fucking kidding me
right now?

21:48.213 --> 21:50.715
Oh, come on.

21:50.717 --> 21:52.115
- Please?
- Yeah, please.

21:52.117 --> 21:54.285
Come on, Jackie.
You owe me one.

21:54.287 --> 21:56.187
Remember that night
after Bonnaroo?

21:56.189 --> 21:58.756
<i>♪ La, la, la, la
Let's just not... ♪</i>

21:58.758 --> 22:01.392
Jug! Jug! Jug!

22:13.605 --> 22:17.242
<i>♪ Take your hands
Let it out ♪</i>

22:45.838 --> 22:50.109
Top of our game, boys,
top of our game.

23:05.290 --> 23:06.759
Hm.

23:25.411 --> 23:26.709
Hmm.

23:26.711 --> 23:28.448
Holy shit.

23:43.194 --> 23:46.697
And Jackie Simms
was just standing over you?

23:46.699 --> 23:47.998
Yes, sir.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.333
And then what?

23:49.335 --> 23:50.901
And then the police
showed up.

23:50.903 --> 23:52.469
You called the police?

23:52.471 --> 23:56.239
I mean, we didn't call them.
They showed up.

23:56.241 --> 23:57.841
Why do you suppose that is?

23:57.843 --> 24:00.311
I have no idea.

24:00.313 --> 24:01.980
Huh.

24:07.319 --> 24:09.687
Is this your handwriting?

24:09.689 --> 24:11.391
Yeah.

24:12.959 --> 24:14.394
Where did you get this?

24:16.628 --> 24:19.764
Why don't you tell me what you
and your friends did yesterday.

24:19.766 --> 24:22.365
First of all,
they're not really my friends.

24:22.367 --> 24:24.066
I've only known them
like a year.

24:24.068 --> 24:27.036
We don't hang out
outside the band.

24:27.038 --> 24:29.672
They're more like coworkers
than anything.

24:29.674 --> 24:33.544
Then tell me what you and your
coworkers did yesterday, Kirk.

24:33.546 --> 24:35.979
Start with the van.

24:35.981 --> 24:39.283
Phew.
We took off, like, 7 a.m.

24:39.285 --> 24:42.084
The 10 was full of people
trying to get to the festival,

24:42.086 --> 24:44.455
so we took Highway 74.

24:54.200 --> 24:57.433
Oh, come on. What
the fuck is this shit?

24:57.435 --> 24:58.568
It's Vivaldi.

24:58.570 --> 25:00.738
I thought
Imagine Dragons was bad.

25:00.740 --> 25:01.971
I like Imagine Dragons.

25:01.973 --> 25:03.873
Who doesn't like
Imagine Dragons?

25:03.875 --> 25:05.674
Well,
it's better than this shit.

25:05.676 --> 25:08.378
- This shit's putting me to sleep.
- It's calming.

25:08.380 --> 25:11.081
I figured we could use some calm
before the storm.

25:11.083 --> 25:12.382
Fucking party storm.

25:15.488 --> 25:18.354
Speaking of which,
I did bring a little surprise

25:18.356 --> 25:20.323
for the hearty party
tonight.

25:20.325 --> 25:21.658
- Oh, sweet.
- Presenting...

25:21.660 --> 25:22.758
Oh, nice!

25:22.760 --> 25:24.260
It's a 2009.

25:24.262 --> 25:26.296
- I figured we deserve it.
- Absolutely.

25:26.298 --> 25:27.730
How much did that
set you back?

25:27.732 --> 25:29.833
- Don't worry about it.
- Dude, pop it open.

25:29.835 --> 25:31.568
- Yes! Pop it now.
- No. Hey, no.

25:31.570 --> 25:34.970
No one's popping anything.
We are in a moving vehicle.

25:34.972 --> 25:37.073
We don't want to get
arrested.

25:37.075 --> 25:38.475
Good point.

25:38.477 --> 25:41.478
- Hey, let me check that out.
- Sure.

25:41.480 --> 25:44.280
So I decided we're
gonna go straight to the house

25:44.282 --> 25:46.385
and skip the festival today.

25:49.521 --> 25:51.020
I'm kidding.

25:51.022 --> 25:52.322
Fuck.

25:52.324 --> 25:54.423
Jesus Christ, lighten up.

25:54.425 --> 25:57.160
Oh, my God,
you had me, though.

25:57.162 --> 25:58.996
Oh, my God, I freaked out.

26:38.770 --> 26:41.270
Yeah. Yeah, this place
definitely looks

26:41.272 --> 26:42.573
like my grandma's house.

26:42.575 --> 26:45.308
I need to hang out
with your grandma.

26:45.310 --> 26:47.844
Cool, a Pachinko machine.

26:47.846 --> 26:49.513
Oh, fuck, yeah.

26:49.515 --> 26:51.181
Yeah.

26:51.183 --> 26:52.783
So how are we picking rooms?

26:52.785 --> 26:55.119
First come, first serve,
<i>Big Brother</i> style?

26:55.121 --> 26:57.054
Sure, whatever,
but I get the master.

26:57.056 --> 26:58.322
Why do you get the master?

26:58.324 --> 27:00.526
Because I said so.

27:03.362 --> 27:06.332
It's heated!
The pool is heated!

27:13.472 --> 27:15.404
Oh, hey,
I just threw my bag up there.

27:15.406 --> 27:17.240
Did you want the top bunk?

27:17.242 --> 27:19.109
I don't know.

27:19.111 --> 27:20.411
Byron, are you okay?

27:20.413 --> 27:22.412
Yeah, it's just nerves.

27:22.414 --> 27:24.515
The concert tomorrow
and everything.

27:24.517 --> 27:29.219
Dude, don't worry about it.
We're gonna kill it. All right?

27:29.221 --> 27:31.521
Yeah. Yeah, we'll kill it.

27:31.523 --> 27:34.091
Hey, are you gonna
break that thing open or what?

27:34.093 --> 27:37.326
Ah. No.
It's not even cold yet.

27:37.328 --> 27:39.261
Let me know when you do,
all right?

27:39.263 --> 27:40.697
I don't wanna miss it.

27:40.699 --> 27:43.403
All right, I promise.
Scout's honor.

28:00.752 --> 28:03.353
You have an errand.
Go to the liquor store.

28:03.355 --> 28:05.756
- Grab a couple cases of beer.
- And some whiskey.

28:05.758 --> 28:07.824
- Why do I have to go?
- You're fresh meat.

28:07.826 --> 28:10.126
Jackie, it's been like a year.

28:10.128 --> 28:12.461
Still newer than us.

28:12.463 --> 28:15.298
Okay, fine.
But I'm picking the whiskey.

28:15.300 --> 28:17.433
Just make sure
it's not in a plastic bottle.

28:17.435 --> 28:19.835
- Nothing Canadian.
- We're an American rock band,

28:19.837 --> 28:21.771
we drink American whiskey.

28:21.773 --> 28:22.972
And get some pizza!

28:31.115 --> 28:32.649
Excuse me.

28:32.651 --> 28:35.952
Do you have American whiskey
in glass bottles?

28:35.954 --> 28:37.589
Bottom shelf.

28:47.566 --> 28:50.435
Am I doing something hilarious
that I'm not aware of?

28:54.439 --> 28:57.576
Aren't you the keyboard player
from Starfoxy?

28:58.810 --> 29:01.179
I am. In the flesh.

29:02.048 --> 29:03.380
I knew it!

29:03.382 --> 29:04.914
We just saw your video
on YouTube.

29:04.916 --> 29:06.949
Yeah. We, like, love you guys.

29:06.951 --> 29:10.720

29:18.096 --> 29:19.496
Yeah.

29:19.498 --> 29:21.864
- Are you guys having a party?
- Yeah.

29:21.866 --> 29:24.802
Oh, yeah, not really.
We play at noon tomorrow,

29:24.804 --> 29:27.537
so I think we're just gonna grab
a drink, head to bed.

29:27.539 --> 29:30.774
Oh, that's pretty fucking lame.
Heh.

29:30.776 --> 29:32.875
I mean, come on,
it's festival weekend.

29:32.877 --> 29:34.978
How about
we all have a party?

29:34.980 --> 29:38.384
- Ooh. I second that notion.
- I third that.

29:41.319 --> 29:42.651
Do you guys have a car?

29:42.653 --> 29:45.423
My sweet ride
is right over there.

29:46.625 --> 29:48.158
Do you guys, uh...

29:48.160 --> 29:50.226
have a pen?

29:51.329 --> 29:52.495
Do we have a pen, girls?

29:52.497 --> 29:53.697
I think we're 2-for-2.

29:53.699 --> 29:55.266
- I've a pen.
- Look at that.

29:55.268 --> 29:56.802
We are staying...

29:58.604 --> 29:59.872
here.

30:02.407 --> 30:03.672
Nice of you to show up.

30:03.674 --> 30:05.275
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

30:05.277 --> 30:07.878
Okay, well...

30:07.880 --> 30:11.381
- Look at this place.
- Crazy.

30:11.383 --> 30:12.949
- Are you kidding me?
- Come on.

30:12.951 --> 30:15.686
- Dude, who owns this place?
- I have no idea.

30:15.688 --> 30:17.653
- Oh, wait, look.
- He's got no idea.

30:17.655 --> 30:19.189
- Gnomes.
- You gonna get it for me?

30:22.627 --> 30:24.393
- It's a pool.
- What?

30:24.395 --> 30:26.395
- Ooh. Very nice.
- Crazy.

30:26.397 --> 30:28.298
You didn't say
there was a pool.

30:28.300 --> 30:31.668
Hey, guys, this is Amber,
Lucy and Maple.

30:31.670 --> 30:34.203
I met them at the store.
They're fans of ours.

30:34.205 --> 30:36.509
Oh, my God, no way.

30:38.777 --> 30:41.577
So you guys coming
to the festival tomorrow?

30:41.579 --> 30:44.347
Yeah, we're staying
in this super-dodgy motel

30:44.349 --> 30:45.815
- in Palm Springs.
- Heh.

30:45.817 --> 30:47.717
Yeah. I'm pretty sure
there's a meth lab

30:47.719 --> 30:49.419
in the manager's office.
Heh.

30:49.421 --> 30:51.020
Oh, jeez. That sucks.

30:51.022 --> 30:53.725
Meth's, like, a total epidemic
right now.

30:54.593 --> 30:56.192
- Yeah, man.
- Hey, man,

30:56.194 --> 30:58.393
would you mind showing me
where your iPad is?

30:58.395 --> 31:00.398
Yeah, yeah.

31:03.634 --> 31:07.303
Hey, so Kirk says you guys are
playing the festival tomorrow.

31:07.305 --> 31:08.708
That's so cool.

31:10.075 --> 31:11.341
It sure is.

31:14.846 --> 31:17.014
We should probably get
these inside, huh?

31:17.016 --> 31:19.216
- Come on. Come on.
- Yeah, we should go.

31:24.356 --> 31:26.824
That's why we can't
go to Modesto anymore.

31:26.826 --> 31:29.992
Well, that's fair.

31:29.994 --> 31:32.895
So who writes the songs?

31:32.897 --> 31:35.298
We all do.

31:35.300 --> 31:36.833
Everyone has ideas.

31:36.835 --> 31:40.370
We all contribute
and we all get credit.

31:40.372 --> 31:41.938
Except for "Castles."

31:41.940 --> 31:44.275
Only one of us
wrote "Castles," huh?

31:44.277 --> 31:46.876
Oh.
Kirk, "Castles" was all you?

31:46.878 --> 31:49.078
Yup. It was the first one
I presented

31:49.080 --> 31:51.414
to the band and boom.

31:51.416 --> 31:52.981
No way. That's so sick.

31:52.983 --> 31:55.017
Yeah.
I actually have tons of songs.

31:55.019 --> 31:58.055
I've been working on them
since I was, like, a teenager.

31:58.057 --> 32:00.323
- This is so cute.
- Oh.

32:00.325 --> 32:02.593
Let me see.

32:02.595 --> 32:05.362
Oh, I wanna write my name
in a heart on the cover.

32:06.698 --> 32:08.331
Damn, you guys have enough
in here

32:08.333 --> 32:10.334
for, like, 30 more
Starfoxy albums.

32:10.336 --> 32:13.103
Well, uh...

32:13.105 --> 32:15.805
Actually,
tomorrow's gonna be my first

32:15.807 --> 32:19.109
and my last festival appearance
with Starfoxy.

32:19.111 --> 32:21.443
What? What does that mean?

32:21.445 --> 32:23.546
I've decided
to go my own way.

32:23.548 --> 32:27.049
Yeah,
but we're cool with it, though.

32:27.051 --> 32:28.518
It was a group decision.

32:28.520 --> 32:31.621
Wait, you guys are breaking up?
That's so sad.

32:31.623 --> 32:35.525
No, we're not breaking up.

32:35.527 --> 32:37.526
Starfoxy will live on.

32:37.528 --> 32:40.430
It's just without Kirk.

32:43.035 --> 32:46.569
But for now,
I say we celebrate.

32:46.571 --> 32:48.572
Mm.

32:48.574 --> 32:51.408

you can call?

33:17.269 --> 33:18.938

33:21.772 --> 33:23.806
You need to be wearing
sunglasses.

33:23.808 --> 33:26.644
Hey, has anybody seen
my sunglasses?

33:30.481 --> 33:32.282
You guys look thirsty.

33:32.284 --> 33:33.650
What is this?

33:33.652 --> 33:35.785
It's my world-famous
Old Fashioned.

33:35.787 --> 33:39.456
It's rye whiskey, bitters,
sugar, and a slice of orange.

33:39.458 --> 33:41.525
Oh, and some Rohypnol,
of course.

33:45.263 --> 33:47.263
Mm. Roofie goodness.

33:47.265 --> 33:48.465
Yeah, enjoy.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.936
So this is you singing?

33:52.938 --> 33:55.305
Like, you did this whole thing
yourself?

33:55.307 --> 33:56.639
- That's kind of awesome.
- Yeah.

33:56.641 --> 33:58.141
I got like 50 demos
in there.

33:58.143 --> 34:00.677
Hopefully somebody gets
to hear them soon.

34:00.679 --> 34:03.779
But not with Starfoxy.
That's so sad.

34:03.781 --> 34:06.583
Well, to be honest with you,

34:06.585 --> 34:09.688
I met with this agent and...

34:11.623 --> 34:14.422
Well, he told me
I don't need these guys.

34:14.425 --> 34:18.228
Like, why should I slave away
trying to make Starfoxy relevant

34:18.230 --> 34:19.862
when I can go solo

34:19.864 --> 34:22.364
and just, you know,
take credit where credit's due?

34:22.367 --> 34:25.367
I mean, this guy, he said
I could be their Peter Gabriel

34:25.369 --> 34:27.036
or Chris Cornell.

34:27.039 --> 34:28.469
Their Beyoncé.

34:30.306 --> 34:34.309
So, what, you're not gonna
play me a Kirk original live?

34:37.248 --> 34:38.248
Like, right now?

34:38.250 --> 34:40.219
Yeah, now.

34:42.454 --> 34:43.920

in the house,

ladies and gentleman?

36:18.617 --> 36:20.083
Wow.

36:20.085 --> 36:22.184
And I thought
this was a fucking party

36:22.186 --> 36:26.157
and you're killing my buzz
with your open-mic shit.

36:30.027 --> 36:31.994
Jackie, can I talk to you
in the kitchen

36:31.996 --> 36:34.296
about something real quick?

36:34.298 --> 36:35.831
So serious.

36:35.833 --> 36:38.900
- <i>♪ In the park on your skates ♪</i>

36:38.902 --> 36:41.271

36:41.273 --> 36:44.007
Can you guys
give us a second?

36:44.009 --> 36:45.277
Thanks.

36:47.045 --> 36:48.945
Seriously,
what is your problem?

36:48.947 --> 36:50.813
I don't have a problem.

36:50.815 --> 36:52.382
I'm having a great time

36:52.384 --> 36:54.950
at your fucking
going-away party.

36:54.952 --> 36:57.753
- That's what this is about.
- What else would it be about?

36:57.755 --> 37:00.557
Jackie, you said
you were okay with this.

37:00.559 --> 37:02.925
I lied, Kirk.

37:02.927 --> 37:05.662
I fucking lied.

37:05.664 --> 37:07.331
I mean,
what did you want me to say?

37:07.333 --> 37:09.465
You used us
so that you could have a hit

37:09.467 --> 37:12.200
and then you immediately told us
to go fuck ourselves.

37:12.202 --> 37:14.436
You're unbelievable.
You think I used you?

37:14.438 --> 37:17.139
- That's how this worked out?
- I didn't see anybody else

37:17.141 --> 37:19.041
jumping to hire
some 22-year-old idiot

37:19.043 --> 37:20.644
from fucking Bakersfield.

37:20.646 --> 37:22.345
Yeah, and I didn't see
anyone else

37:22.347 --> 37:25.751
jumping to join a mediocre
bar band called Starfoxy.

37:35.661 --> 37:38.630
Thanks for the champagne.
Fuck you.

37:42.067 --> 37:43.800
Oh, that one almost went in.

37:45.804 --> 37:48.470
Send, like, three balls
at a time.

37:52.878 --> 37:55.912
Hey,
Maple's looking for you.

37:55.914 --> 37:58.180
She went down there.

37:58.182 --> 38:00.052
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

38:01.119 --> 38:03.353
Maple?

38:03.355 --> 38:06.157
- Maple?
- Kirk?

38:07.726 --> 38:10.128
I was thinking
we could go for a swim.

38:17.101 --> 38:19.270
Let me see if I brought
my bathing suit.

38:25.710 --> 38:27.246
So...

38:29.547 --> 38:32.014
Where'd you get
the bathing suit from?

38:32.016 --> 38:35.318
Heh. From my purse.

38:35.320 --> 38:39.421
Well, I guess that shows us
what kind of girl you are.

38:39.423 --> 38:40.956
Good night, Jackie.

38:40.958 --> 38:42.624
Good night.

38:42.626 --> 38:44.295
Have fun.

38:48.500 --> 38:53.838
So are you the type
to get in slow or just jump?

39:01.179 --> 39:03.081
Fuck it.

39:27.172 --> 39:29.371
God, this is so weird.

39:29.373 --> 39:30.673
What?

39:30.675 --> 39:32.374
Well...

39:32.376 --> 39:35.945
I was just watching you
in a music video yesterday.

39:35.947 --> 39:38.481
And now...

39:38.483 --> 39:41.818
you are right in front of me,
inches from my face

39:41.820 --> 39:43.887
and you're about to kiss me.

39:43.889 --> 39:47.590
- Oh, am I?
- Yeah.

39:47.592 --> 39:50.059
How can you be so sure?

39:50.061 --> 39:51.628
Woman's intuition.

39:55.800 --> 39:57.534
Maple!

39:57.536 --> 39:59.101
We're leaving. Now.

39:59.103 --> 40:01.269
- Everyone out.
- What are you doing?

40:01.271 --> 40:03.072
These people
are fucking sleazebags.

40:03.074 --> 40:04.440
Get out of the pool.
Let's go.

40:04.442 --> 40:07.008
No, I'm having a good time.

40:07.010 --> 40:09.345
- What happened?
- Lucy and I are leaving

40:09.347 --> 40:13.014
and we're not gonna
leave you here alone. Come on.

40:13.016 --> 40:15.520
I'll be back in two seconds.

40:24.362 --> 40:26.862
She just, like,
came in and kicked us out.

40:26.864 --> 40:28.463
I don't know what happened.

40:28.465 --> 40:31.434
Dude,
what the fuck happened?

40:31.436 --> 40:32.869
I don't know.

40:32.871 --> 40:34.604
Seriously,
what the fuck did you do?

40:34.606 --> 40:37.240
I didn't do anything. Amber and
Lucy were in Jackie's room

40:37.242 --> 40:38.909
with Travis,
now they're pissed.

40:38.911 --> 40:40.911
They came out
and told everyone to leave.

40:40.913 --> 40:42.612
Why were they
in Jackie's room?

40:42.614 --> 40:44.213
I don't know.

40:44.215 --> 40:45.715
Well, where's Travis?

40:45.717 --> 40:47.085
I don't know.

41:06.438 --> 41:07.970
They leave?

41:07.972 --> 41:10.773
Yep. They all left.

41:10.775 --> 41:13.876
But I'm still here.

41:19.217 --> 41:21.920
You don't see nights like this
in L.A.

41:23.755 --> 41:25.356
Sure don't.

41:50.748 --> 41:52.014
Mm.

41:52.016 --> 41:54.983
Kirk.
What the fuck happened?

41:54.985 --> 41:56.251
Oh, God!

42:01.293 --> 42:03.525
Maple?

42:03.527 --> 42:04.760
Maple?

42:04.762 --> 42:06.362
- You guys,
- Come on.

42:06.364 --> 42:09.597
you're not gonna believe
what happened last night.

42:09.599 --> 42:11.168
Hey, Maple.

42:12.036 --> 42:13.572
Oh, shit.

42:30.454 --> 42:34.356
And that was the first time
you saw her that morning?

42:34.358 --> 42:35.657
Yeah.

42:35.659 --> 42:37.860
But, I mean, honestly,

42:37.862 --> 42:41.099
I barely remember her
from the night before. Look...

42:42.132 --> 42:43.898
Before we get any deeper
into this,

42:43.900 --> 42:45.534
I feel like there's...

42:45.536 --> 42:47.403
something I need to share
with you.

42:47.405 --> 42:50.305
And I know it's gonna make me
look very, very bad,

42:50.307 --> 42:54.276
but... I feel it's best
to mention it now,

42:54.278 --> 42:59.016
for the good of this whole
overall thing and all.

43:00.050 --> 43:01.286
I...

43:03.253 --> 43:08.993
I am often very high.

43:11.429 --> 43:12.862
No kidding.

43:12.864 --> 43:15.130
Like, a lot.

43:15.132 --> 43:18.200
To an unhealthy degree,
and I know that.

43:18.202 --> 43:20.036
I've done
the research online.

43:20.038 --> 43:22.403
They say
it's incredibly psychologically,

43:22.405 --> 43:25.240
if not physically,
addictive.

43:25.242 --> 43:27.677
And I have a prescription.

43:27.679 --> 43:31.280
Why don't you tell me
about what you can remember?

43:31.282 --> 43:33.148
Start with the van.

43:33.150 --> 43:35.152
Um...

43:37.855 --> 43:42.124
Well, I mean, I smoked
a breakfast bowl right...

43:42.126 --> 43:43.226
That's marijuana.

43:43.228 --> 43:44.396
- Got it.
- I was...

43:46.197 --> 43:49.298
Uh... Jackie picked me up,

43:49.300 --> 43:50.932
passed out ASAP.

43:50.934 --> 43:53.769
And when I woke up,
we were already at the festival.

43:53.771 --> 43:55.606
What about the champagne?

43:57.240 --> 43:59.043
What champagne?

44:02.012 --> 44:03.912
We're gonna crash!

44:05.382 --> 44:06.751
Wake up, dipshit.

44:07.952 --> 44:09.184
Great, we're here.

44:09.186 --> 44:10.920
Every man for himself.

44:10.922 --> 44:12.921
Meet back here at 4.

44:12.923 --> 44:15.791
- I hope they have dragons here.
- I love dragons.

44:15.793 --> 44:17.526
Who doesn't?

44:27.137 --> 44:29.637
<i>♪ And there ain't no girl ♪</i>

44:29.639 --> 44:32.441
<i>♪ With whom
I could be seen ♪</i>

44:32.443 --> 44:35.378
<i>♪ And there ain't no girl ♪</i>

44:35.380 --> 44:38.847
<i>♪ That knows
Just what to do ♪</i>

44:38.849 --> 44:42.418
<i>♪ I don't know that bad things

44:42.420 --> 44:44.420
<i>♪ They should happen

44:44.422 --> 44:46.889

44:46.891 --> 44:49.724
<i>♪ Well, they should happen

44:49.726 --> 44:52.729
<i>♪ Half of all

44:52.731 --> 44:55.063
<i>♪ Well, they should happen
To you ♪</i>

44:55.065 --> 44:58.135
<i>♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh ♪</i>

45:03.273 --> 45:04.974
Hey, where'd you find
this place?

45:04.976 --> 45:07.144
Your grandma.

45:11.181 --> 45:13.883
What's up with these gnomes?

45:16.820 --> 45:19.690
Whoa, check it out.
It's a Plinko machine.

45:24.795 --> 45:26.829
Well, first things first,

45:26.831 --> 45:28.664
I'm headed
to the liquor store.

45:28.666 --> 45:32.200
Also gonna see
if I can scrounge up some puss.

45:34.237 --> 45:36.805
- All right, this is awkward.
- I know.

45:36.807 --> 45:39.307
Yeah, you said we were
gonna do this in the van.

45:39.309 --> 45:41.276
Well, someone
was fucking sleeping.

45:41.278 --> 45:44.445
Oh, hey, look what I'm doing.
I'm poking you with my finger.

45:44.447 --> 45:46.615
Sure bet
that would wake someone up.

45:46.617 --> 45:49.016
I still think we wait
till tomorrow after the show.

45:49.018 --> 45:52.188
No, we tell him tonight
so he won't wanna play tomorrow,

45:52.190 --> 45:56.458
and that way
we call Sweaty Jeff and boom,

45:56.460 --> 45:59.862
new Starfoxy is born
on the festival stage.

45:59.864 --> 46:03.099
But how do you know he's not
gonna wanna play one last show?

46:03.101 --> 46:06.135
Man, he's a fucking baby,
okay?

46:06.137 --> 46:08.371
The moment we tell him,
he's gone.

46:08.373 --> 46:11.373
And it's, "Sayonara, Kirky."

46:11.375 --> 46:12.874
I hope you're right.

46:12.876 --> 46:14.376
Dude, trust me.

46:14.378 --> 46:15.845
I'm always right.

46:15.847 --> 46:17.979
Wanna see
if they have a Ping-Pong table?

46:17.981 --> 46:19.115
Yeah.

46:27.625 --> 46:29.224
It hit the net.
That's a redo.

46:29.226 --> 46:31.026
No, it's only a redo
on the serve.

46:31.028 --> 46:34.195
- No, it's a redo every time.
- It's only a redo on the serve.

46:34.197 --> 46:36.032
In what rule book?

46:36.034 --> 46:37.199
All of them.

46:39.204 --> 46:41.104
- Aren't they all?
- No.

46:41.106 --> 46:43.304
Hey. Girls.

46:44.876 --> 46:47.043
We're staying
in a motel in Indio.

46:47.045 --> 46:48.844
- You guys got any meth?
- No.

46:48.846 --> 46:50.579
Kirk says
you're playing tomorrow.

46:50.581 --> 46:52.213
Weather's supposed to be
so cool.

46:52.215 --> 46:55.284
Oh, come on, dude. I thought
we had a deal. No partying.

46:55.286 --> 46:56.918
This isn't partying.

46:56.920 --> 46:59.688
I think showing up with
a bottle of whiskey and groupies

46:59.690 --> 47:02.791
kind of leads to partying,
don't you think?

47:02.793 --> 47:05.360
Look, Jackie,
if you wanna do

47:05.362 --> 47:07.963
this whole Mary Poppins thing,
go right ahead.

47:07.965 --> 47:10.766
All right? I've got
some earplugs you can borrow.

47:10.768 --> 47:13.769
But you're not my mom. I'm gonna
chase it tonight whether...

47:13.771 --> 47:16.374
You're out of the band,
dude.

47:20.978 --> 47:22.411
- What?
- Yeah, we thought

47:22.413 --> 47:24.780
it was the best thing
for the group.

47:24.782 --> 47:27.816
Best for the group.
Best for the group?

47:27.818 --> 47:30.920
I've been a critical part of
this group for a fucking year.

47:30.922 --> 47:33.222
We gave it a shot
and it didn't work out.

47:33.224 --> 47:37.327
Heh. Look, there are plenty
of keyboard players out there,

47:37.329 --> 47:39.228
especially ones
who don't treat people

47:39.230 --> 47:42.097
that are supposed to be
their friends like assholes.

47:42.099 --> 47:43.898
You two agree with this?

47:46.471 --> 47:48.137
So this is how you tell me?

47:48.139 --> 47:49.704
In front of total strangers.

47:49.706 --> 47:52.340
Hey, nobody asked you
to go scrounging for puss.

47:55.612 --> 47:57.579
Well, you know what?

47:57.581 --> 48:00.215
Whether you want me
in this band or not,

48:00.217 --> 48:02.617
I'm playing that show
tomorrow.

48:02.619 --> 48:04.385
You can't deny me
that experience.

48:04.387 --> 48:06.287
I fucking earned it.

48:06.289 --> 48:07.521
He's right.

48:07.523 --> 48:09.291
Fuck, yeah, I'm right.

48:09.293 --> 48:11.260
And you know what else,
Jackie?

48:11.262 --> 48:13.362
I'm gonna party tonight

48:13.364 --> 48:16.333
like I've been waiting to
for months.

48:17.936 --> 48:19.434
Call some friends.

48:19.436 --> 48:21.403
Hot ones.

48:21.405 --> 48:25.010
Travis,
order us some pizzas.

48:29.414 --> 48:31.483
Later, dude.

48:44.461 --> 48:46.161
- Hey, man.
- Hey, how's it going?

48:46.163 --> 48:47.398
All right.

48:48.766 --> 48:50.633
Hey,
has anybody ever told you

48:50.635 --> 48:52.834
you look like the dude
from <i>American Pie?</i>

48:52.836 --> 48:53.936
Who?

48:53.938 --> 48:55.237
The Sherminator.

48:56.340 --> 48:58.539
Because I have red hair? No.

48:58.541 --> 49:01.011
Forty-two fifty.

49:02.579 --> 49:04.146
Here you go.
Keep the change.

49:04.148 --> 49:05.517
Have a good night.

49:10.221 --> 49:13.655
All right, who wants pizza?
Excuse me.

49:13.657 --> 49:16.291
Hey, man.
You want some coconut water?

49:16.293 --> 49:18.126
I got a whole case
in the fridge.

49:18.128 --> 49:19.595
No, thanks. I'm good.

49:19.597 --> 49:21.697
All right.
Well, remember to stay hydrated.

49:21.699 --> 49:24.266
We're in a desert,
after all.

49:24.268 --> 49:27.369
- Cool. Cool.
- All right.

49:27.371 --> 49:29.271
Oh, the Sazerac you requested,
sir.

49:29.273 --> 49:32.340
- Oh, why, thank you, Miss Lucy.
- You're so welcome.

49:32.342 --> 49:34.043
- Hi.
- Hey.

49:34.045 --> 49:36.345
So do you wanna go teach me
how to play your drums?

49:36.347 --> 49:40.548
Mm. I would, because people love
when you turn the music off

49:40.550 --> 49:42.583
at a party
to give a drum lesson.

49:42.585 --> 49:44.287
There's just one problem.

49:44.289 --> 49:46.121
I can't find my sunglasses.

49:46.123 --> 49:48.590
Can't give a drum lesson
without sunglasses.

49:48.592 --> 49:50.124
Okay, heh.

49:50.126 --> 49:53.329
So do you wanna go
smoke this joint, then?

49:53.331 --> 49:54.766
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

49:58.603 --> 50:00.436
So was that awkward for you,

50:00.438 --> 50:02.840
earlier
at the Ping-Pong table?

50:04.509 --> 50:06.175
What,
you don't like Ping-Pong?

50:09.481 --> 50:11.546
Yeah, of course it was.

50:11.548 --> 50:13.516
It wasn't supposed
to go down like that.

50:13.518 --> 50:15.251
We were supposed to do it
in the van.

50:15.253 --> 50:19.086
Well, at least he has Maple
to console him,

50:19.088 --> 50:21.789
and knowing her, she's gonna
do it in a bathing suit.

50:21.791 --> 50:23.494
Hm.

50:24.561 --> 50:26.929
So Jackie's pretty intense,
huh?

50:26.931 --> 50:28.831
I'm good.

50:28.833 --> 50:30.833
I was watching
the "Castles" video,

50:30.835 --> 50:32.934
and I was like,
"She seems intense,

50:32.936 --> 50:36.037
but she's probably
really down-to-earth."

50:36.039 --> 50:39.909
And then I met her
and I was like,

50:39.911 --> 50:43.211
"No,
she's really that intense."

50:43.213 --> 50:45.046
She's actually pretty chill.

50:45.048 --> 50:48.117
I think this whole Kirk thing
has been pretty rough on her.

50:48.119 --> 50:50.753
On all of us, really.

50:50.755 --> 50:52.621
But she knows
what she's doing.

50:52.623 --> 50:56.492
She's our fearless leader,
on-stage and off.

50:56.494 --> 50:59.927
Sure, sometimes she can use
some unorthodox methods

50:59.929 --> 51:02.130
to get things done,
but, you know, I trust her

51:02.132 --> 51:04.201
to do what's best
for the band.

51:09.507 --> 51:11.572
Can I ask you
a personal question?

51:11.574 --> 51:13.641
Sure.

51:13.643 --> 51:15.811
Where's the bathroom?

51:15.813 --> 51:18.514
Whew. Oh, my... I don't...
It's right there.

51:19.617 --> 51:20.949
Thanks.

51:28.592 --> 51:30.226
- Kirk!
- Seriously?

51:31.561 --> 51:32.994
Come on.

51:32.996 --> 51:34.764
Stop.

51:34.766 --> 51:36.632
- It's not even funny anymore.
- Come on.

51:36.634 --> 51:39.434
Stop. No, no. Stop.

51:39.436 --> 51:40.601
What a dick.

51:40.603 --> 51:41.970
What did you say?

51:41.972 --> 51:44.976
Oh, I wasn't talking
to you. Uh...

51:46.277 --> 51:48.409
Allison?

51:48.411 --> 51:50.345
Anne?

51:50.347 --> 51:51.479
What the fuck?

51:51.481 --> 51:53.617
Okay. Wait.

52:05.228 --> 52:07.664
Jennifer Perry?

52:29.786 --> 52:33.657
Come on. Come and look
at the stars with me.

52:48.271 --> 52:50.905
Don't see nights like this
in L.A.

52:54.043 --> 52:55.913
Nope.

52:57.081 --> 52:58.345
Look.

52:58.347 --> 53:00.048
It's Orion's Belt.

53:01.184 --> 53:03.987
Oh, shit,
I forgot to call my mom.

53:06.623 --> 53:07.789
Huh.

53:07.791 --> 53:09.958
That's weird.

53:09.960 --> 53:12.760
That you wanna call
your mom right now?

53:12.762 --> 53:15.130
Yeah, it's a little weird.

53:15.132 --> 53:16.632
No, my phone.

53:16.634 --> 53:19.233
It was on the charger
right there.

53:19.235 --> 53:20.869
I didn't notice.

53:20.871 --> 53:22.873
Yeah, it was.

53:24.809 --> 53:27.041
You sure you didn't
accidentally grab it?

53:27.043 --> 53:29.344
It had a bright green case.

53:29.346 --> 53:32.317
I'm pretty sure, yeah.

53:33.684 --> 53:36.184
Would you mind checking?

53:36.186 --> 53:38.956
Like, in your purse?

53:41.425 --> 53:42.490
Okay.

53:48.231 --> 53:50.099
I mean...

53:50.101 --> 53:51.233
I don't...

53:51.235 --> 53:52.767
Oh.

53:52.769 --> 53:54.436
Wait.

53:54.438 --> 53:56.039
Here it is.

53:57.942 --> 54:01.012
- Wait, what?
- Shh.

54:03.914 --> 54:07.648
Hey. We have a problem.

54:07.650 --> 54:09.252
Okay.

54:12.422 --> 54:14.858
- So...
- Shut up.

54:15.992 --> 54:18.693
- Are you...?
- Shut the fuck up.

54:28.771 --> 54:31.139
Nice discretion, Jen.

54:31.141 --> 54:32.740
Douche went through my purse

54:32.742 --> 54:34.510
while I was
in the bathroom, Erin.

54:34.512 --> 54:37.211
What? No. I wasn't being creepy.
I was just...

54:37.213 --> 54:38.780
I couldn't remember
her name.

54:38.782 --> 54:40.682
Oh, well, thank God.

54:40.684 --> 54:42.751
Next time,
take your purse with you.

54:42.753 --> 54:44.987
Noted. Thanks.

54:44.989 --> 54:46.987
What are we gonna do,
blow this place?

54:46.989 --> 54:49.356
No. Have you seen
their equipment?

54:49.358 --> 54:52.494
That's like 6, 7000 dollars'
worth of stuff right there.

54:52.496 --> 54:56.000
And earlier I was scoping out
the bedrooms and I found...

54:57.201 --> 54:59.771
You know, actually,
this might work out.

55:01.771 --> 55:02.905
Move.

55:02.907 --> 55:04.505
Go.

55:07.043 --> 55:08.943
Keep it cool, Cheech.

55:08.945 --> 55:10.778
Take this.

55:10.780 --> 55:12.884
Go ahead, drink.

55:13.884 --> 55:15.452
Okay.

55:22.358 --> 55:24.295
What's up, dude?

55:25.661 --> 55:28.229
Switch rooms with me.

55:28.231 --> 55:30.499
What?

55:30.501 --> 55:32.735
Why?

55:32.737 --> 55:34.503
Your bed is bigger.

55:34.505 --> 55:35.804
Oh, come on, man.

55:35.806 --> 55:38.539
Are you fucking kidding me
right now?

55:38.541 --> 55:40.675
Oh, come on. Please?

55:40.677 --> 55:42.911
Yeah, please.

55:42.913 --> 55:45.046
You owe me one, Jackie.

55:45.048 --> 55:47.751
Remember that night
after Kaaboo?

55:52.623 --> 55:55.090
Good catch.

55:55.092 --> 55:57.025
Didn't notice it
in my sweep earlier.

55:57.027 --> 55:59.228
That's why they pay me
the big bucks.

55:59.230 --> 56:01.498
So you guys are, like,
bandits or something?

56:02.900 --> 56:04.633
Like, sexy female bandits?

56:04.635 --> 56:06.901
Something like that.

56:06.903 --> 56:08.771
That's pretty cool.

56:08.773 --> 56:12.206
- What's the combination?
- To what?

56:12.208 --> 56:14.608
To the fucking safe
I'm currently pointing at.

56:14.610 --> 56:17.114
I don't know. I didn't even know
there was a safe there.

56:18.414 --> 56:20.548
What? Kirk told us
you owned this house.

56:20.550 --> 56:22.650
That sounds like
something he'd say.

56:22.652 --> 56:25.186
Was he trying to get
into your pants at the time?

56:25.188 --> 56:27.157
Shit.

56:28.257 --> 56:29.990
Okay, we'll call Rita.

56:29.992 --> 56:31.726
Rita's car is in the shop.

56:31.728 --> 56:33.229
Then we'll go pick her up.

56:33.231 --> 56:36.865
Is Rita,
like, your safecracker? Uh...

56:36.867 --> 56:38.365
Oh.

56:38.367 --> 56:41.670
I suddenly don't feel
so good.

56:41.672 --> 56:43.838
I kind of feel like...

56:50.746 --> 56:53.014
It's probably the Rohypnol.

56:53.016 --> 56:55.182
The date-rape drug?

56:55.184 --> 56:58.188
Heh. It was in the Sazerac
I made for you.

56:59.523 --> 57:02.990
It should be kicking in
pretty hardcore right about now.

57:02.992 --> 57:05.226
Are you gonna date-rape me?

57:05.228 --> 57:09.432
Heh. Guess you'll find out
in the morning, won't you?

57:24.447 --> 57:25.581
Ow.

57:25.583 --> 57:28.048
Oh, God, what the fuck?

57:28.050 --> 57:30.552
Am I in a closet?

57:36.927 --> 57:39.461
Yeah, I'm in a closet.

57:49.739 --> 57:51.072
Kirk.

57:51.074 --> 57:53.141
- What the fuck happened?
- Oh, God!

57:53.143 --> 57:55.177
Maple?

57:55.179 --> 57:59.014
You guys aren't gonna believe
what happened last night. Oh...

57:59.016 --> 58:00.914
- Hey, Maple.
- Oh, shit.

58:11.360 --> 58:13.295
Palm Springs
Police Department.

58:13.297 --> 58:14.929
You the owner
of the residence?

58:14.931 --> 58:16.530
Um, no.

58:16.532 --> 58:19.269
- Well, may I speak to the owner?
- They're not here.

58:21.606 --> 58:24.139
- You know where they are?
- East Coast?

58:24.141 --> 58:26.407
Look, we got a situation here.
There's a girl...

58:26.409 --> 58:28.346
You recognize this vehicle?

58:31.414 --> 58:33.951
Oh, shit.

58:41.625 --> 58:46.394
Appears the driver mysteriously
lost control of the vehicle

58:46.396 --> 58:48.432
and slammed
right into some rocks.

58:50.300 --> 58:52.936
Neither was wearing
a seat belt.

58:59.744 --> 59:03.146
It seems like there's something
on your mind there, Byron.

59:07.516 --> 59:10.487
You ever hear
of the prisoner's dilemma?

59:11.722 --> 59:13.287
Two suspects are arrested,

59:13.289 --> 59:15.557
charged with committing
a crime together.

59:15.559 --> 59:18.159
They're separated
and offered the same deal.

59:18.161 --> 59:21.229
Whoever rats the other one out
first walks free,

59:21.231 --> 59:24.635
while his co-conspirator goes
to jail forever.

59:26.003 --> 59:28.001
But if your friend
rats you out first,

59:28.003 --> 59:30.037
you go to jail forever

59:30.039 --> 59:32.340
and he goes free.

59:32.342 --> 59:35.077
So the question is this:

59:35.079 --> 59:36.510
How much do you trust...?

59:36.512 --> 59:39.715
I'll just tell you everything,
okay?

59:39.717 --> 59:42.050
I'll tell you the truth.

59:42.052 --> 59:44.418
I've heard a lot
of truth today, Byron.

59:44.420 --> 59:48.491
No, you've heard the story
we were supposed to tell you.

59:52.228 --> 59:54.329
We left around 9 a.m.

59:54.331 --> 59:56.532
We took the 74
because we figured

59:56.534 --> 59:58.333
there'd be less cops
than on the 10.

01:00:19.188 --> 01:00:21.088
So, Kirk,

01:00:21.090 --> 01:00:22.692
score any coke?

01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:26.630
Ask and you shall receive.

01:00:31.501 --> 01:00:34.702
All right. So we gonna dip
into that shit tonight

01:00:34.704 --> 01:00:36.738
or are we gonna wait
till tomorrow after the show?

01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:39.974
No night as good as the present.
I ain't waiting for shit.

01:00:39.976 --> 01:00:43.711
Hey, as much as I love that
shit, we're in a motor vehicle.

01:00:43.713 --> 01:00:46.280
Can you not go
waving it around?

01:00:46.282 --> 01:00:48.115
Good point.

01:00:48.117 --> 01:00:50.453
Hey. Let me see that.

01:01:08.271 --> 01:01:10.338
I'm gonna check out
New Pollution first.

01:01:10.340 --> 01:01:11.807
What about you guys?

01:01:11.809 --> 01:01:13.842
- Wax Battleship.
- Invasion 101.

01:01:13.844 --> 01:01:16.778
Every man for himself.
Let's meet back here at 4.

01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:18.112
We're good.

01:01:21.851 --> 01:01:24.422
Come on. He's waiting.

01:01:41.371 --> 01:01:43.374
It's Jackie.

01:01:46.309 --> 01:01:47.842
Jackie.

01:01:47.844 --> 01:01:50.244
Nice to see you.

01:01:50.246 --> 01:01:53.183
Have a seat, gentlemen.

01:01:54.550 --> 01:01:57.251
You want coconut water?
I got a case in the fridge.

01:01:57.253 --> 01:01:59.854
No, I'm good, thanks.

01:01:59.856 --> 01:02:01.757
Okay, well, remember
to stay hydrated.

01:02:01.759 --> 01:02:03.624
We are in the desert,
after all.

01:02:03.626 --> 01:02:04.793
One moment.

01:02:04.795 --> 01:02:09.296
Finishing something up,
and...

01:02:09.298 --> 01:02:10.498
excellent.

01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:13.534
Sorry. So how are you?

01:02:13.536 --> 01:02:14.836
Good.

01:02:14.838 --> 01:02:16.438
And Noah?

01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:18.907
How'd he like that shit
I gave him for Vegas?

01:02:18.909 --> 01:02:21.476
- Said it was A-plus.
- Excellent. Excellent.

01:02:21.478 --> 01:02:23.912
We really care
about customer service here.

01:02:23.914 --> 01:02:25.546
So let's get you set up.

01:02:25.548 --> 01:02:28.885
So like I said
in my text, 800.

01:02:29.987 --> 01:02:32.189
Yup.

01:02:39.963 --> 01:02:41.095
It's all there.

01:02:41.097 --> 01:02:44.735
I know. I trust you.

01:02:46.068 --> 01:02:47.969
We're good.

01:02:47.971 --> 01:02:49.871
So I gotta tell you,

01:02:49.873 --> 01:02:52.240
I was a little surprised
when I got your order in.

01:02:52.242 --> 01:02:56.211
This yearly gathering
of musicians flush with cash,

01:02:56.213 --> 01:02:58.278
big boom for my business,

01:02:58.280 --> 01:03:01.883
in terms of molly, shrooms,

01:03:01.885 --> 01:03:04.385
coke,

01:03:04.387 --> 01:03:07.121
and a shit-ton of weed.

01:03:07.123 --> 01:03:09.724
But you, always coming up

01:03:09.726 --> 01:03:12.793
with new, inventive ways
to keep me on my toes.

01:03:12.795 --> 01:03:14.362
Ah.

01:03:14.364 --> 01:03:16.300
Here it is.

01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:19.166
Is it pure?

01:03:19.168 --> 01:03:20.635
Pure?

01:03:20.637 --> 01:03:22.936
That is grade-A organic

01:03:22.938 --> 01:03:26.844
from-the-poppy-fields-
of-occupied-Afghanistan pure.

01:03:29.380 --> 01:03:32.680
Do you guys want some needles?
I buy 'em in bulk.

01:03:34.418 --> 01:03:36.921
That won't be necessary.

01:03:44.126 --> 01:03:45.594
Okay.

01:03:45.596 --> 01:03:47.929
So go out there,
be seen, take selfies,

01:03:47.931 --> 01:03:49.097
do keg stands, whatever.

01:03:49.099 --> 01:03:50.867
Just act normal.

01:04:37.313 --> 01:04:38.646
Check it out.
They've got one

01:04:38.648 --> 01:04:41.416
of these Chinese
pinball machines.

01:04:41.418 --> 01:04:44.387
Oh, yes.

01:04:45.788 --> 01:04:48.555
Go pick your rooms.
Byron, you're bunking with him.

01:04:48.557 --> 01:04:50.728
I'm taking the master.

01:04:57.065 --> 01:04:58.999
Daddy loves you.

01:05:01.070 --> 01:05:02.470
Whew.

01:05:05.376 --> 01:05:07.943
You getting
that 3 o'clock feeling?

01:05:07.945 --> 01:05:11.746
Little lump of sugar
in your coffee?

01:05:11.748 --> 01:05:14.248
Uh... No, not right now, man.
I'm cool.

01:05:14.250 --> 01:05:16.083
All right, suit yourself.

01:05:32.501 --> 01:05:35.202
Hey, I'm gonna hit
the liquor store.

01:05:35.204 --> 01:05:36.739
All right.

01:05:43.380 --> 01:05:44.679
We really doing this?

01:05:44.681 --> 01:05:47.182
We're really doing this.

01:05:47.184 --> 01:05:48.816
We still cool?

01:05:48.818 --> 01:05:52.853
<i>♪ Are you ready

01:05:52.855 --> 01:05:59.994
<i>♪ Are you ready

01:05:59.996 --> 01:06:01.731
Let's go.

01:06:15.144 --> 01:06:17.047
Get the demos.

01:06:21.818 --> 01:06:24.353
How much is he gonna have
to snort before...?

01:06:24.355 --> 01:06:26.487
Not much.
He'll be on the floor

01:06:26.489 --> 01:06:28.791
before he realizes
anything's wrong.

01:06:33.028 --> 01:06:35.396
Are you sure about this?
This is the point of no return.

01:06:35.398 --> 01:06:37.097
Don't give me
this bullshit right now.

01:06:37.099 --> 01:06:39.568
I don't get why he can't play
the last concert.

01:06:39.570 --> 01:06:41.334
- We can do this tomorrow night.
- No, we can't.

01:06:41.336 --> 01:06:43.871
We talked about this endlessly.
It happens tonight.

01:06:43.873 --> 01:06:45.807
I've got Jeff on standby.

01:06:45.809 --> 01:06:48.677
He's learned Kirk's parts,
can be here in the morning.

01:06:48.679 --> 01:06:50.778
- You told Jeff what we're doing?
- No, Byron.

01:06:50.780 --> 01:06:53.748
Jesus, I'm not an idiot. I told
him we were gonna fire Kirk.

01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:57.084
Hey, listen. I get it.

01:06:57.086 --> 01:07:01.856
You're having second thoughts.
It's a man's life.

01:07:01.858 --> 01:07:05.559
But look at the direction that
he's gone since "Castles" hit.

01:07:05.561 --> 01:07:08.496
All the alcohol,
all the coke.

01:07:08.498 --> 01:07:11.398
He's gonna be
shooting up soon anyway.

01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:16.739
I mean, we're just beating fate
to the punch, right?

01:07:29.119 --> 01:07:32.487

01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:06.720
What are you gonna do
with the coke?

01:08:06.722 --> 01:08:08.623
I don't know.
Save it for a rainy day?

01:08:08.625 --> 01:08:10.458
I mean, Kirk,
he gets some good shit.

01:08:10.460 --> 01:08:12.394
I'd hate for it
to go to waste.

01:08:12.396 --> 01:08:16.331
Now, come on, let's figure out
what the fuck we've been doing.

01:08:16.332 --> 01:08:18.165

- ...this entire house.
- A pool.

01:08:33.149 --> 01:08:34.883
And there's three bedrooms?

01:08:34.885 --> 01:08:36.951
- I think so.
- Very nice.

01:08:36.953 --> 01:08:39.319
Hey, Kirk.

01:08:39.322 --> 01:08:40.688
Who are your new friends?

01:08:40.689 --> 01:08:44.593
Uh... This is Maple,
Amber and Lucy.

01:08:44.595 --> 01:08:46.727
We met at the liquor store.

01:08:46.729 --> 01:08:48.728
Yeah. Thanks for having us over.

01:08:48.729 --> 01:08:50.865
We're staying in this motel
in Cathedral City

01:08:50.867 --> 01:08:52.600
that's honestly so sketchy.

01:08:52.603 --> 01:08:54.902
I'm pretty sure
that there's a meth lab

01:08:54.904 --> 01:08:56.604
in the manager's office.

01:08:56.606 --> 01:08:59.207
Would you show me
where your iPad is?

01:09:00.274 --> 01:09:01.944
Yeah, man. Yeah.

01:09:03.546 --> 01:09:06.546
Kirk says you are playing
the festival. That's so cool.

01:09:06.548 --> 01:09:08.182
Byron, stay calm, man.

01:09:08.184 --> 01:09:10.984
Stay calm?
What if he offers it to them?

01:09:10.987 --> 01:09:13.787
We just have to make sure
that doesn't happen, don't we?

01:09:13.788 --> 01:09:15.990
No, we have to get it
right now and flush it.

01:09:15.992 --> 01:09:18.125
What will you say to Kirk
when he catches you?

01:09:18.127 --> 01:09:20.126
How will you explain
his missing coke?

01:09:20.127 --> 01:09:21.928
- I don't know...
- No, goddamn it.

01:09:21.930 --> 01:09:24.298
Byron, if you try anything,
I swear to God...

01:09:24.300 --> 01:09:27.602
We just need to get these chicks
out of here as soon as we can.

01:09:27.604 --> 01:09:29.169
Don't let them
leave your sight.

01:09:29.171 --> 01:09:32.908
Stay calm.
Point of no return.

01:09:37.011 --> 01:09:41.215
This weekend's gonna be
my first and last festival show

01:09:41.216 --> 01:09:43.050
with Starfoxy.

01:09:43.051 --> 01:09:45.986
Your last festival show
with Starfoxy?

01:09:45.988 --> 01:09:48.054
What does that mean?

01:09:48.055 --> 01:09:49.924
I've decided
to go my own way.

01:09:49.926 --> 01:09:53.428
Yeah, but we're cool with it.
It was a group decision.

01:09:53.430 --> 01:09:56.530
But Starfoxy's breaking up?
That's so sad.

01:09:56.532 --> 01:09:59.834
No.
No, we're not breaking up.

01:09:59.836 --> 01:10:03.537
Starfoxy will live on, just...

01:10:03.539 --> 01:10:05.406
without Kirk.

01:10:05.408 --> 01:10:09.744
But in honor of the eve
of our last show together,

01:10:09.746 --> 01:10:12.647
I propose that we celebrate.
All right?

01:10:12.649 --> 01:10:15.450
Yeah. I have some friends
I could call.

01:10:17.252 --> 01:10:19.153

Stevie Wonder's
in the house!

01:10:57.359 --> 01:10:59.626
I thought this was supposed
to be a party,

01:10:59.628 --> 01:11:02.263
but you're killing my buzz, man.

01:11:02.265 --> 01:11:06.133
Jackie, can I talk to you
in the kitchen for a second?

01:11:06.135 --> 01:11:07.468
Sure.

01:11:34.663 --> 01:11:36.097
Oh, hey, where you going?

01:11:36.099 --> 01:11:39.302
I was gonna change
into my swimsuit.

01:11:41.170 --> 01:11:43.937
Hey, I made you
my world-famous Old Fashioned.

01:11:43.939 --> 01:11:45.772
Oh, thanks.

01:11:45.774 --> 01:11:47.775
It's super tasty.
Do you want to...?

01:11:47.777 --> 01:11:49.410
- You should try it.
- Where's Maple?

01:11:49.412 --> 01:11:51.446
You know what?
Maple's looking for you.

01:11:51.448 --> 01:11:53.246
She just went
down the hallway.

01:11:53.248 --> 01:11:54.516
Okay.

01:11:54.518 --> 01:11:56.817
Try it. It's so yummy.
I just made it.

01:11:56.819 --> 01:11:59.990
- I'll be right back.
- Oh... Okay.

01:12:04.627 --> 01:12:06.259
I don't know.

01:12:06.261 --> 01:12:09.129
It's already turning
into kind of a weird night.

01:12:09.131 --> 01:12:10.697
Then let's get weirder.

01:12:12.835 --> 01:12:15.503
Okay. I'll, uh...

01:12:15.505 --> 01:12:17.841
I'll try and find my suit.

01:12:26.983 --> 01:12:28.281
Here we go.

01:12:28.283 --> 01:12:29.650
Crazy.

01:12:31.121 --> 01:12:32.919
- Actually, uh...
- Hm.

01:12:32.921 --> 01:12:34.321
Do you party?

01:12:34.323 --> 01:12:37.625
- Do I party how?
- Uh...

01:12:37.627 --> 01:12:39.963
with blow?

01:12:41.663 --> 01:12:43.598
Oh.

01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:45.802
As a matter of fact, I do.

01:12:47.569 --> 01:12:49.536
But...

01:12:49.538 --> 01:12:52.206
I'm okay for now.

01:12:52.208 --> 01:12:55.910
Maybe later?
A little pick-me-up.

01:12:55.912 --> 01:12:57.946
Okay.

01:12:57.948 --> 01:13:00.751
All right. I'm gonna change
in here. Don't look.

01:13:09.958 --> 01:13:13.028
- <i>What's up?</i>
- I can't.

01:13:14.796 --> 01:13:15.963
What?

01:13:15.965 --> 01:13:17.164
Starfoxy will be just fine.

01:13:17.166 --> 01:13:19.136
We don't have to do this.

01:13:22.506 --> 01:13:24.804
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:13:24.806 --> 01:13:27.575
What happens halfway
into recording the first record

01:13:27.577 --> 01:13:29.543
when the label realizes
the three of you

01:13:29.545 --> 01:13:32.213
can't write a hit song
to save your fucking lives?

01:13:32.215 --> 01:13:34.382
<i>They want you
because of "Castles,"</i>

01:13:34.384 --> 01:13:35.516
<i>and that's it.</i>

01:13:35.518 --> 01:13:37.518
<i>Songs are the key here,
Byron,</i>

01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:41.858
<i>and his demos are worth
a fortune in the right hands.</i>

01:13:42.926 --> 01:13:45.626
Do the others share your...

01:13:45.628 --> 01:13:47.693
newfound sense of morality?

01:13:47.695 --> 01:13:49.229
No, they're on board.

01:13:49.231 --> 01:13:51.434
Everything's going
according to your plan.

01:13:56.439 --> 01:13:57.839
Man up, Byron.

01:13:57.841 --> 01:14:01.008
<i>Man the fuck up.</i>

01:14:01.010 --> 01:14:04.010
<i>This is what's best
for you.</i>

01:14:04.012 --> 01:14:05.612
<i>And most importantly,</i>

01:14:05.614 --> 01:14:08.816
it's what's best for us.

01:14:08.818 --> 01:14:10.884
Now...

01:14:10.886 --> 01:14:13.255
<i>can you do this?</i>

01:14:16.324 --> 01:14:17.758
Yeah.

01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:20.928
We're leaving.
Now. Everyone out!

01:14:20.930 --> 01:14:23.696
I gotta go. I love you.

01:14:23.698 --> 01:14:25.501
I love you too.

01:14:33.342 --> 01:14:36.410
- Why is everyone leaving?
- Ask your friend Travis.

01:14:36.412 --> 01:14:38.044
- <i>Come on.</i>
- Where is he?

01:14:38.046 --> 01:14:40.548
In hell, for all I care.
Come on!

01:14:40.550 --> 01:14:42.049
Let's go!

01:14:42.051 --> 01:14:44.018
- Maple, hurry up!
- Just... No...

01:14:44.020 --> 01:14:45.986
No "wait," just
get out the door.

01:14:45.988 --> 01:14:47.821
Let's go!

01:14:47.823 --> 01:14:49.389
Oh, my God, I can...

01:14:49.391 --> 01:14:52.559
Byron, what happened?

01:14:52.561 --> 01:14:54.027
I don't know.

01:14:54.029 --> 01:14:55.929
Seriously, dude,
what did you do?

01:14:55.931 --> 01:14:57.263
I didn't do anything.

01:14:57.265 --> 01:14:59.400
- Where's Travis?
- I don't know!

01:15:00.935 --> 01:15:02.572
Bro, calm down.

01:15:04.573 --> 01:15:06.473
Listen,

01:15:06.475 --> 01:15:08.608
I know I'm gonna miss
nights like this.

01:15:08.610 --> 01:15:09.943
You know, the four of us,

01:15:09.945 --> 01:15:13.113
getting crazy,
getting shit-faced.

01:15:13.115 --> 01:15:15.516
I mean, just promise me
that we'll still do this,

01:15:15.518 --> 01:15:19.122
you know, like,
even after it's over, yeah?

01:15:21.256 --> 01:15:23.357
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

01:15:23.359 --> 01:15:24.895
Good.

01:15:32.702 --> 01:15:34.101
Oh, fuck this.

01:16:33.595 --> 01:16:35.528
Oh.

01:16:35.530 --> 01:16:38.132
It's kicking in.

01:16:38.134 --> 01:16:40.235
Good night.

01:16:44.606 --> 01:16:47.607
And that's it.
I mean, that's everything.

01:16:47.609 --> 01:16:51.445
I don't know how they died.
I don't know how anybody died.

01:16:51.447 --> 01:16:52.481
I do.

01:16:53.515 --> 01:16:56.717
See, I already had
the map key.

01:16:56.719 --> 01:16:58.818
I just never had the map.

01:16:58.820 --> 01:17:03.092
And now you and your friends
have drawn it for me.

01:17:04.460 --> 01:17:05.793
Byron,

01:17:05.795 --> 01:17:09.599
do you know who owns
3855 Guadalupe Way?

01:17:10.699 --> 01:17:12.598
Donald and Mary Houlbrook.

01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:14.701
Sweet couple,
live in Boston.

01:17:14.703 --> 01:17:17.737
Own a chain
of greeting-card stores.

01:17:17.739 --> 01:17:19.906
Spoke to them
this morning and...

01:17:19.908 --> 01:17:22.843
well, they were very upset
to hear about what happened

01:17:22.845 --> 01:17:24.812
in their home.

01:17:24.814 --> 01:17:27.281
Apparently isn't
the first time, though.

01:17:27.283 --> 01:17:28.648
Last year
during the festival,

01:17:28.650 --> 01:17:31.050
someone was renting
their place

01:17:31.052 --> 01:17:33.153
and smashed their mailbox

01:17:33.155 --> 01:17:36.523
and pissed
all over the garage door.

01:17:36.525 --> 01:17:39.395
Which is why
they installed security cameras.

01:17:40.762 --> 01:17:42.229
Hm.

01:17:42.231 --> 01:17:45.435
Hidden in the garden gnomes
by the front door.

01:18:07.422 --> 01:18:09.826
<i>What's up
with these gnomes?</i>

01:18:11.961 --> 01:18:14.561
- <i>Where'd you find this place?</i>
- <i>Airbnb.</i>

01:18:14.563 --> 01:18:16.531
<i>I guess the couple lives
on the East Coast</i>

01:18:16.533 --> 01:18:19.769
<i>and they only use it
in winter.</i>

01:18:21.103 --> 01:18:22.803
<i>Who owns this house?</i>

01:18:22.805 --> 01:18:24.604
<i>That would be Travis.</i>

01:18:24.606 --> 01:18:26.940
<i>It's kind of our
weekend-getaway place</i>

01:18:26.942 --> 01:18:29.110
<i>when our pad in the Hills
gets too stuffy.</i>

01:18:29.112 --> 01:18:31.648
- <i>Yeah? That's nice.</i>
- <i>Cool.</i>

01:18:34.451 --> 01:18:36.383
- <i>Hi.</i>
- <i>Hi. Forty-two fifty.</i>

01:18:36.385 --> 01:18:38.885
<i>Hey, anybody ever tell you
you look...?</i>

01:18:38.887 --> 01:18:42.322
- <i>I think she beat us here.</i>
- <i>Yeah, she always does.</i>

01:18:42.324 --> 01:18:44.525
- <i>Awesome. I never do that.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

01:18:44.527 --> 01:18:47.428
<i>Let's go, what the hell
are we waiting for?</i>

01:18:47.430 --> 01:18:49.162
- <i>Come on!</i>
- <i>Jesus Christ!</i>

01:18:50.698 --> 01:18:53.334
<i>Nice. I actually
like it when you yell.</i>

01:18:53.336 --> 01:18:55.468
<i>Harsh, but I liked it.</i>

01:18:55.470 --> 01:18:57.705
- <i>It was out of love.</i>
- <i>It was good.</i>

01:18:57.707 --> 01:19:00.741
<i>Hey. Shh. Shut the fuck up.</i>

01:19:00.743 --> 01:19:01.878
<i>Be quiet.</i>

01:19:03.613 --> 01:19:06.649
<i>There go the witnesses
who saw the end of the party.</i>

01:19:07.850 --> 01:19:09.983
<i>Time to get to work.</i>

01:19:09.985 --> 01:19:12.785
<i>We're gonna get Rita,
help with the safe.</i>

01:19:12.787 --> 01:19:14.589
<i>We'll take the canyon,
be back in a few.</i>

01:19:14.591 --> 01:19:17.191
<i>I'll stay here,
hold things down.</i>

01:19:17.193 --> 01:19:19.259
<i>Who cares about the safe?</i>

01:19:19.261 --> 01:19:21.961
<i>We do. Call it a bonus.</i>

01:19:21.963 --> 01:19:24.330
<i>The boys aren't
even out yet, so...</i>

01:19:24.332 --> 01:19:28.101
<i>Hard to shoot heroin up
their veins if they're awake.</i>

01:19:28.103 --> 01:19:29.937
- Heh.
- <i>We'll get the safe</i>

01:19:29.939 --> 01:19:33.874
- <i>and it'll be fine.</i>
- <i>The safe isn't the priority.</i>

01:19:33.876 --> 01:19:35.409
<i>The overdoses are.</i>

01:19:35.411 --> 01:19:37.643
<i>If I wake up in the morning</i>

01:19:37.645 --> 01:19:40.848
<i>and they're still alive,
we're all gonna be fucked.</i>

01:19:40.850 --> 01:19:44.084
<i>The situation is gonna be
fucked. So we focus.</i>

01:19:44.086 --> 01:19:45.751
<i>Focus?</i>

01:19:45.753 --> 01:19:48.522
<i>Last time I checked,
it was your husband</i>

01:19:48.524 --> 01:19:50.857
<i>that was bankrolling
this tragic accident</i>

01:19:50.859 --> 01:19:53.759
<i>to kick-start your solo career.
Wasn't you.</i>

01:19:53.761 --> 01:19:56.830
<i>So why don't you
let us do our job?</i>

01:19:56.832 --> 01:20:00.166
<i>You can go pop a bar,
get a little beauty sleep,</i>

01:20:00.168 --> 01:20:02.236
<i>and let us handle it.</i>

01:20:02.238 --> 01:20:03.806
<i>Understood?</i>

01:20:05.207 --> 01:20:06.940
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:20:06.942 --> 01:20:08.474
<i>Sure.</i>

01:20:08.476 --> 01:20:10.410
<i>Go get Rita.</i>

01:20:10.412 --> 01:20:13.179
<i>Do whatever it is
that you need to do.</i>

01:20:13.181 --> 01:20:15.415
<i>We will. Hey.</i>

01:20:15.417 --> 01:20:17.587
<i>Where's the coke?</i>

01:20:18.688 --> 01:20:20.019
<i>What?</i>

01:20:20.021 --> 01:20:22.222
<i>The coke you switched
with Kirk's.</i>

01:20:22.224 --> 01:20:25.459
<i>Where is it?
Noah said we could have it.</i>

01:20:25.461 --> 01:20:28.227
<i>In my guitar case.</i>

01:20:28.229 --> 01:20:30.265
<i>Fucking twat.</i>

01:20:31.900 --> 01:20:35.236
- <i>Want some blow for the road?</i>
- <i>"Where's the coke?"</i>

01:20:35.238 --> 01:20:37.571
<i>See you in a second.</i>

01:20:37.573 --> 01:20:40.410
- <i>I'll cut it up.</i>
- <i>We'll be in the car.</i>

01:21:15.211 --> 01:21:17.945
