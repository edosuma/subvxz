00:01.468 --> 00:01.901
This is the

00:01.901 --> 00:02.202
This is
the Evergreen Forest.

00:03.937 --> 00:06.306
Quiet, peaceful, serene.

00:08.174 --> 00:10.677
That is, until
Bert Raccoon wakes up.

00:10.677 --> 00:12.345
Bert Raccoon: Yahoooo!

00:13.813 --> 00:15.815
Yeeeehaaaa!

00:16.883 --> 00:17.917
Yikes!

00:18.651 --> 00:19.819
Yaaaah...

00:22.689 --> 00:24.124
Yeaaaah!

00:24.124 --> 00:26.960
Luckily, he has some
good friends to help him out.

00:34.601 --> 00:36.803
Life would be simple
in the forest except for...

00:38.138 --> 00:39.806
Cyril Sneer!

00:43.209 --> 00:45.512
And his life would be simple
except for...

00:46.479 --> 00:47.981
the Raccoons!!

00:47.981 --> 00:50.183
♪ (show theme music) ♪

01:01.661 --> 01:04.230
The Evergreen Forest
is full of wonders.

01:04.230 --> 01:07.467
So when Melissa decided to
photograph some of them

01:07.467 --> 01:09.836
for a special feature in the
Evergreen Standard,

01:09.836 --> 01:11.738
Bert Raccoon suggested
they start

01:11.738 --> 01:14.274
with the Endless Echo Caverns.

01:16.242 --> 01:18.411
It's got to be
around here somewhere.

01:18.411 --> 01:20.413
Who knows
what we might find?

01:20.413 --> 01:22.615
There might be
hidden treasure,

01:22.615 --> 01:26.019
and there could be
a race of Mole men,

01:26.019 --> 01:28.188
lost civilizations,

01:28.188 --> 01:30.190
sacred cities.

01:30.190 --> 01:32.926
Bats!!
B-Ba-Bats?!

01:32.926 --> 01:35.361
Oh well, he-he-he,
I guess it's not here.

01:36.196 --> 01:38.798
Woa-woaaaaah!

01:38.798 --> 01:40.100
Ou!

01:41.367 --> 01:43.169
Well, that was easy.

01:46.606 --> 01:49.209
I don't see any bats!
bats-bats...

01:50.276 --> 01:53.580
Hey!
Hey this is great!

01:54.781 --> 01:57.083
Beeert Raccooooon!

01:58.718 --> 02:00.453
It's me.

02:00.453 --> 02:02.188
Bert!

02:02.188 --> 02:04.357
Raccoon!

02:04.958 --> 02:07.060
Bert, Bert, Bert!

02:10.797 --> 02:13.399
Come on,
let's look down this way Bert.

02:13.399 --> 02:17.203
I don't like this
Melissa, it's too creepy.

02:17.203 --> 02:20.540
♪ (suspenseful music) ♪

02:20.540 --> 02:22.008
Yikes!

02:22.775 --> 02:24.110
Okay.

02:24.110 --> 02:27.380
Th-this is far enough for me!

02:27.380 --> 02:29.449
Bert, look!

02:30.283 --> 02:33.019
This is fantastic, Bert!

02:33.019 --> 02:36.389
Wait. It looks to me like
prehistoric cave paintings.

02:37.090 --> 02:39.626
This could be thousands and
thousands of years old.

02:40.293 --> 02:43.296
Then it'll still
be here tomorrow.

02:43.296 --> 02:45.832
Let's get outta here, Melissa!

02:45.832 --> 02:47.734
This could be one of
the greatest

02:47.734 --> 02:49.769
historical finds ever made!

02:49.769 --> 02:51.504
Hey, where's Broo?

02:51.504 --> 02:53.006
Broo?

02:53.006 --> 02:55.408
Broo, come here, little fella!

02:55.408 --> 03:00.947
I-i-it's not s-sa-safe
wondering around by yourself.

03:02.549 --> 03:04.184
Come on, Broo!

03:04.184 --> 03:07.420
There's nothing to be...
scared off!

03:08.388 --> 03:09.789
Aaaah!

03:09.789 --> 03:12.225
Yeaaaaah!

03:12.225 --> 03:14.661
Meellisssaaaa!

03:14.661 --> 03:17.197
Aaaaah!

03:18.565 --> 03:20.934
Wait 'til
you see them, Ralph!

03:20.934 --> 03:22.035
They're thrilling!

03:23.136 --> 03:24.704
They look a lot
like cave paintings

03:24.704 --> 03:26.472
I've seen in art
history books.

03:26.472 --> 03:28.942
Don't go, Ralph.
It's dark down there

03:28.942 --> 03:32.378
and there's monsters
in that cave!

03:33.680 --> 03:35.515
I have no
intention of going,

03:35.515 --> 03:38.952
until my bouillabaisse
is finished.

03:38.952 --> 03:41.854
As a matter of fact,
don't even go outside

03:41.854 --> 03:44.724
It...
may have followed us home.

03:48.828 --> 03:52.999
Oh, Bert, there are
no monsters in that cave!

03:52.999 --> 03:56.502
If there was a monster,
why didn't I see it?

03:56.502 --> 03:59.505
Because it was lurking.

03:59.505 --> 04:00.873
Em...

04:02.542 --> 04:05.712
Pass me that bouquet
garni, will you Bert?

04:05.712 --> 04:09.382
Eh, this dish needs a soupcon,
some more fennel.

04:09.382 --> 04:11.351
Then it will be... mm-mm-mmm!

04:11.351 --> 04:12.885
Perfect!

04:12.885 --> 04:14.754
You know, I notice you
start talking funny

04:14.754 --> 04:16.889
when you put on
that chef's hat, Ralph.

04:16.889 --> 04:20.393
I really think we
need the advice of an expert.

04:20.393 --> 04:22.862
No, I'm sure,
it needs more fennel.

04:22.862 --> 04:26.532
Ralph!? I'm talking
about the cave paintings.

04:26.532 --> 04:29.402
Here Bert, try this!

04:29.402 --> 04:32.438
It's my 'piece de resistance.'

04:35.441 --> 04:36.776
Well?

04:36.776 --> 04:39.412
I know exactly,
what it needs.

04:39.412 --> 04:41.848
Perhaps a dash more
freshly ground pepper?

04:41.848 --> 04:43.416
Nah!

04:43.416 --> 04:45.752
The best spice of all!!

04:45.752 --> 04:47.253
Peanut butter!

04:48.421 --> 04:51.758
Bert!!! You've ruined it!

04:51.758 --> 04:54.060
Well... just a
matter of taste, Ralph!

04:54.827 --> 04:57.730
Professor
Witherspoon Smedley-Smithe

04:57.730 --> 05:00.199
from the museum is
excited about our find!

05:00.199 --> 05:02.735
He's coming out to have
a look at the paintings.

05:05.238 --> 05:08.474
The Pig 1: I do so
love cultural events.

05:09.142 --> 05:13.012
The Pig 2: Yes, but we
must attend more of them.

05:14.480 --> 05:17.884
The Pig 3:
They're so... enlightening

05:17.884 --> 05:19.285
Enlightening?!

05:19.285 --> 05:21.421
You porkers aren't
getting any lighter.

05:21.421 --> 05:23.456
I don't know, why I let
you talk me into this.

05:23.456 --> 05:24.657
The Pig 1: But, Sir...

05:24.657 --> 05:27.393
you're broadening
your social horizons!

05:27.393 --> 05:29.329
And you're broadening
your waistlines!

05:29.329 --> 05:32.165
Lady Baden-Baden:
Yoohoo, Mr. Sneer.

05:32.165 --> 05:35.535
Oh, it's so nice to
see you at this event!

05:35.535 --> 05:39.772
I didn't realize that
you were an art lover.

05:39.772 --> 05:41.174
Lady Baden-Baden,

05:41.174 --> 05:43.343
the only thing
I love is money.

05:43.876 --> 05:44.911
Who's art?

05:44.911 --> 05:46.546
Lady Baden-Baden:

05:46.546 --> 05:49.682
Oh Mr. Sneer,
you are such a wit!

05:50.917 --> 05:54.320
Ooh, there's Lady
Penelope Banyos.

05:54.320 --> 05:56.322
I do hope we'll
see more of you

05:56.322 --> 05:59.826
at these functions,
Mr Sneer. Ta-taaa!

05:59.826 --> 06:02.662
If there was any
more of you Anthem, lady,

06:02.662 --> 06:04.997
there wouldn't be
room for anyone else.

06:04.997 --> 06:08.501
Mr. Knox: Well, Mr Sneer,

06:08.501 --> 06:13.373
will you be bidding on any
art works this afternoon?

06:13.373 --> 06:15.875
I might.
Then again, I might not.

06:16.976 --> 06:19.178
Mr. Knox: Well I hope
to add a few

06:19.178 --> 06:22.014
definitive works
to my collection.

06:22.849 --> 06:26.519
Would you care to accompany me
to the bidding, Sir?

06:26.519 --> 06:27.854
Eh, certainly!

06:33.893 --> 06:36.362
Ehm, ladies and gentlemen,

06:36.362 --> 06:39.699
our next lot, number 32,

06:39.699 --> 06:43.369
an Henri de la Possum
from his green period.

06:43.369 --> 06:45.271
Who will start?

06:45.271 --> 06:47.673
Mr. Knox: $10,000!

06:47.673 --> 06:49.208
Are you nuts, Knox?

06:49.208 --> 06:51.411
I've seen bigger postage stamps!

06:51.411 --> 06:54.347
- $15,000!
- $20,000!!

06:54.347 --> 06:58.751
$20,000! Do I hear $25,000?

06:58.751 --> 07:02.989
Who would be crazy enough
to pay $25,000 for that?

07:02.989 --> 07:05.425
Mr. Knox: Why, his paintings
just keep going up

07:05.425 --> 07:07.593
in value, Mr. Sneer.

07:07.593 --> 07:11.230
They are a marvelous investment!

07:11.230 --> 07:13.933
$30,000.

07:13.933 --> 07:16.369
Thank you, Mr Knox.
Anyone else?

07:16.369 --> 07:19.405
Mr. Knox: In fact, Mr Mammoth

07:19.405 --> 07:22.542
purchased that painting for $50,

07:22.542 --> 07:24.277
sometime ago.

07:24.277 --> 07:26.946
Fifty?!
- $50,000 !

07:26.946 --> 07:28.114
going...

07:28.114 --> 07:30.016
...going, gone!

07:30.016 --> 07:32.618
Sold to that person
with the bent nose.

07:36.222 --> 07:38.958
Mr. Knox: Congratulations, Sir!

07:38.958 --> 07:42.195
An extremely cultured decision.

07:44.397 --> 07:46.766
$50,000?! Huh!

07:46.766 --> 07:49.602
I've seen better
pictures on a cereal box.

07:49.602 --> 07:53.139
I don't know, Pop, I
think it brightens up the room.

07:53.139 --> 07:54.540
So does a light bulb.

07:54.540 --> 07:58.110
The Pig 1: But Sir, now
you're a patron of the arts.

07:58.110 --> 08:00.947
The Pig 2: Respected
by the masses.

08:00.947 --> 08:01.948
Who cares?

08:01.948 --> 08:04.283
Pop, this
is an investment!

08:04.283 --> 08:08.721
In a while, you can sell the
painting again for a big profit!

08:08.721 --> 08:11.757
After all, Pop, this painting
has already increased

08:11.757 --> 08:14.794
in value by 1,000%.

08:14.794 --> 08:17.263
Now you're
talking my language.

08:17.263 --> 08:22.702
I'll hire this Henri de la
Possum to paint a few more.

08:22.702 --> 08:25.004
Good idea, son!

08:25.004 --> 08:27.206
Hah! Pigs, go find him.

08:27.206 --> 08:28.508
The Pig 1: But, Sir,

08:28.508 --> 08:32.478
the program says he
disappeared five years ago.

08:32.478 --> 08:34.747
Hmm! Too bad!

08:34.747 --> 08:36.649
I'll have to think
of something else.

08:37.650 --> 08:40.853
Cedric, my boy, how long will
I have to keep this painting

08:40.853 --> 08:43.155
for maximum resale value?

08:43.155 --> 08:45.157
I'll go
figure it out, Pop.

08:45.157 --> 08:48.528
It may have
cost me $50,000,

08:48.528 --> 08:51.163
but I've learned,
that art is money.

08:51.163 --> 08:55.067
Pigs, go out and get me
some masterpieces. Cheap!!

08:55.067 --> 08:57.169
You've got 24 hours!

08:57.169 --> 08:59.839
Capiche?
The Pigs: Ah, yes, Sir!

08:59.839 --> 09:01.908
Ah, capiche, capiche!

09:02.708 --> 09:06.512
Ah, yes, indeed!
The secret of great art.

09:06.512 --> 09:09.148
Buy cheap, and sell expensive.

09:11.217 --> 09:13.986
Isn't this exciting?
Exciting indeed.

09:13.986 --> 09:15.955
Now we'll find out just
how ancient and important

09:15.955 --> 09:17.990
these cave paintings are.

09:17.990 --> 09:21.327
I must say,
I certainly have

09:21.327 --> 09:24.697
high hopes for
them, young lady.

09:24.697 --> 09:28.067
Wouldn't it be better,
if I stayed out here?

09:28.067 --> 09:30.736
I could sort of.. um, he-eh,

09:30.736 --> 09:32.538
...guard the entrance.

09:32.538 --> 09:34.206
You're not still afraid

09:34.206 --> 09:36.409
of imaginary monsters, are you?

09:36.409 --> 09:39.345
No, not imaginary ones.

09:39.345 --> 09:41.948
Oh, Bert,
come on, we need you!

09:44.483 --> 09:47.587
You know, this
reminds me of the time

09:47.587 --> 09:51.524
we opened the tomb of
Emperor Ratatouille.

09:51.524 --> 09:55.227
Oh, egad what a thing that was!

09:55.561 --> 09:56.996
I'll bet.

10:00.099 --> 10:02.568
The Pig:
We looked high and low.

10:02.568 --> 10:04.670
The Pig 2: Oh, every gallery

10:04.670 --> 10:06.872
and every artist caring.

10:06.872 --> 10:08.674
The Pig 3: You wouldn't think
it'd be so hard to find

10:08.674 --> 10:10.643
cheap masterpieces.

10:10.643 --> 10:13.579
The Pig 1:
Wait, I've got an idea!

10:14.880 --> 10:17.116
The Pig 3: Oh,
that's brilliant, boy!

10:19.719 --> 10:23.122
The Pig 2: You were right.
It is a fabulous view!

it was a tree.

11:11.637 --> 11:14.306
I just can't believe

11:14.306 --> 11:15.608
its' here, in the
Evergreen Forest!

11:15.608 --> 11:18.811
(muffled) Actually
it's one the most extraordinary

11:18.811 --> 11:21.347
examples I've ever seen.

11:21.347 --> 11:24.684
Uh, those are
spectacular, Melissa!

11:25.985 --> 11:28.287
Oh, simply spectacular!

11:28.287 --> 11:30.890
Of course, we won't
know how old they are,

11:30.890 --> 11:35.928
until I analyze these
scrapings I took.

11:35.928 --> 11:38.531
If the tests are positive,

11:38.531 --> 11:42.134
why these could
well be the most

11:42.134 --> 11:45.705
valuable paintings
ever discovered!!

11:45.705 --> 11:47.206
The Pig 2: Paintings!

11:47.206 --> 11:48.874
The Pig 1: Valuable!

11:48.874 --> 11:51.310
The Pig 3: And they're
on the Boss's land too.

11:51.310 --> 11:53.813
The Pig 1: Oh goodie,
let's tell the boss!

11:54.046 --> 11:56.382
The Pig 2: If we don't
get a raise out of this,

11:56.382 --> 11:58.017
we never will.

11:59.652 --> 12:03.189
Ah! Safe... and famous!

12:03.189 --> 12:05.858
Bert Raccoon, discoverer of

12:05.858 --> 12:08.494
the Endless Echo Cave paintings.

12:08.494 --> 12:09.562
Yahoooo!

12:09.562 --> 12:12.164
Uh, well,
we'll see, Bert.

12:12.164 --> 12:17.236
Hmm, strange, you know
there's something about them.

12:18.037 --> 12:20.673
Oh, it will come to me,
I'm sure. Yes, yes.

12:20.673 --> 12:25.044
I'll take these samples straight
to the museum. Straight.

12:25.044 --> 12:29.749
Yes, we should have
the results very soon.

12:29.749 --> 12:32.017
Come on, Broo.

12:40.493 --> 12:41.927
This better be good!

12:44.063 --> 12:46.465
Now that's what
I call a painting!

12:46.465 --> 12:47.867
What a discovery!

12:47.867 --> 12:50.603
And I went and wasted $50,000

12:50.603 --> 12:53.339
on a Henri de la Possum?!

12:53.339 --> 12:55.508
The size of a pig's brain?

12:55.508 --> 12:58.277
Forget the small stuff,
the bigger the better.

12:58.277 --> 12:59.378
That's what I say.

12:59.378 --> 13:01.013
Hmmm...?

13:01.013 --> 13:04.617
I can't sell this, so the
suckers will have to come here.

13:04.617 --> 13:06.018
I'll charge admission.

13:06.018 --> 13:08.687
This will be the greatest
tourist attraction ever!

13:08.687 --> 13:10.055
Start taking notes.

13:10.055 --> 13:12.091
Measure this for a turnstile.

13:12.091 --> 13:15.227
I want the lunch counter there.
Ticket booth here.

13:15.227 --> 13:17.296
The souvenir stand right here.

13:17.296 --> 13:19.231
And check the back of this cave!

13:19.231 --> 13:22.134
Make sure there's
no way to sneak in!

13:22.134 --> 13:24.970
Everybody pays to see
my cave paintings!

13:24.970 --> 13:28.207
Oh, yes, they do
and do they ever pay!

13:28.207 --> 13:31.110
The Pig 1: Oh, the
boss sure is happy.

13:31.110 --> 13:33.612
The Pig 2:
We're sure get a raise.

13:33.612 --> 13:34.880
The Pig 1: (giggles) Yeah!

13:34.880 --> 13:36.715
A-a-ah-aaah!

13:36.715 --> 13:37.917
A raise!

13:39.451 --> 13:41.954
And nobody can look at it
for more than a minute.

13:41.954 --> 13:43.522
I don't want to wear it out.

13:43.522 --> 13:47.259
The Pigs: Boss!!
Boss! The monsters!

13:47.259 --> 13:49.328
Quit yelling,
you chicken pigs!

13:49.328 --> 13:51.630
There's no such
thing as monsters!

13:51.630 --> 13:55.334
Now take this down to
the Evergreen Standard.

13:55.334 --> 13:57.169
I want it in tomorrow's edition.

13:57.169 --> 13:59.471
The Pigs: Y-yes, Sir!

14:01.807 --> 14:04.476
The Pig 1:
Stop the presses!

14:04.476 --> 14:06.278
I always wanted to say that.

14:07.079 --> 14:10.950
This is for the next
edition, or sooner.

14:11.650 --> 14:13.152
Press conference!

14:13.152 --> 14:17.356
Endless Echo Caverns to be
renamed Sneer Caverns.

14:17.356 --> 14:19.158
Important art find.

14:19.158 --> 14:22.194
Affecting all residents
of the Evergreen Forest.

14:22.194 --> 14:23.829
Tomorrow. Be there!

14:23.829 --> 14:27.600
Signed Cyril Sneer,
patron of the arts?!

14:27.600 --> 14:31.770
Wow, I never thought Pop
would get into art this deep.

14:31.770 --> 14:34.874
How did Cyril find out
about the cave paintings?

14:34.874 --> 14:37.509
The Pig 1:
Superior intelligence!

14:37.509 --> 14:39.044
Oh, really?!

14:39.044 --> 14:40.813
So what's he planning now?

14:40.813 --> 14:43.482
The Pig 2: Oh, only the
greatest tourist attraction

14:43.482 --> 14:44.984
since the beach.

14:44.984 --> 14:48.754
He'll make millions charging
admission to the caves!

14:48.754 --> 14:52.725
The Pig 3:
And soon, a 2,000 room hotel,

14:52.725 --> 14:54.526
a theme park...

14:54.526 --> 14:56.195
The Pig 2:
...bowling alleys!

14:56.195 --> 14:58.464
The Pig 1: Parking lots!

14:58.464 --> 15:00.232
But he can't do that!

15:00.232 --> 15:03.202
A treasure like this
belongs to everyone.

15:03.202 --> 15:06.705
The Pig 2: Wrong.
It belongs to Cyril
Sneer!

15:06.705 --> 15:08.841
It's on his land!

15:19.351 --> 15:21.387
Get this Raccoons!

15:21.387 --> 15:24.390
Next time you want to
look at my paintings,

15:24.390 --> 15:26.258
bring five bucks!

15:28.327 --> 15:32.064
Um, I say what's
going on here, Melissa?

15:32.064 --> 15:35.134
Cyril Sneer is about to
announce the opening,

15:35.134 --> 15:38.170
or should I say closing
of the caves to the public,

15:38.170 --> 15:39.338
unless they pay!

15:39.338 --> 15:43.242
Um, but...
why should he do that?

15:43.242 --> 15:45.010
He owns the land.

15:45.010 --> 15:48.747
Oooh! Well,
then you'll be interested

15:48.747 --> 15:51.884
in the test results,
yes, yes, yes.

15:51.884 --> 15:56.522
Mr. Sneer, I'm from
the Museum, you see.

15:56.522 --> 15:59.692
Great! Come on up here
and join me on the stage.

15:59.692 --> 16:01.193
Thank you.
Makes it more official.

16:01.193 --> 16:02.628
You can cut the ribbon.

16:02.628 --> 16:05.965
But, you see,
what I want tell you,

16:05.965 --> 16:09.401
will only take
a moment, yes, yes.

16:09.401 --> 16:10.803
It's about the...

16:10.803 --> 16:13.205
The Pig: And now,
ladies and gentlemen,

16:13.205 --> 16:15.040
Cyril Sneer,

16:15.040 --> 16:17.242
patron of the arts.

16:19.211 --> 16:21.146
Ehm.. testing...

16:21.146 --> 16:24.550
I, Cyril Sneer, am
pleased to announce

16:24.550 --> 16:27.753
the discovery of the
Sneer Cavern paintings.

16:27.753 --> 16:32.224
The most amazing thing about
these paintings is their age.

16:32.224 --> 16:34.426
How old are they
anyway, Professor?

16:34.426 --> 16:36.795
100, 200,000 years?

16:36.795 --> 16:39.765
Oh,
good heavens, no, no.

16:39.765 --> 16:41.333
Two years.

16:41.333 --> 16:43.268
Two years?!

16:43.268 --> 16:46.171
You told me these
were priceless

16:46.171 --> 16:48.173
prehistoric paintings.

16:48.173 --> 16:49.842
They're worthless.

16:49.842 --> 16:51.910
I'm going to
look like a fool!

16:51.910 --> 16:53.746
I couldn't even
give them away!

16:55.080 --> 16:57.916
The Pig: That's it, Sir!
Give them away!

16:57.916 --> 17:01.253
The Pig 2: Yes, Sir! That's what
a real patron of the arts

17:01.253 --> 17:03.989
would do!
Think of the publicity?

17:04.990 --> 17:06.492
Ehm, ehm!

17:06.492 --> 17:10.462
As I was saying, I am
pleased to hand over

17:10.462 --> 17:12.965
these magnificent caverns

17:12.965 --> 17:15.200
and the paintings therein,

17:15.200 --> 17:16.835
worthless as they are,

17:16.835 --> 17:19.705
to the residents of the
Evergreen Forest.

17:19.705 --> 17:24.043
May they love and enjoy these
fine examples of art.

17:24.043 --> 17:29.148
Courtesy of Cyril Sneer,
patron of the arts.

17:32.518 --> 17:33.952
Way to go, Pop!

17:33.952 --> 17:35.287
That's my Pop.

17:36.889 --> 17:38.824
No more pictures, boys.

17:38.824 --> 17:40.993
I'll release a statement later.

17:40.993 --> 17:44.696
Mr. Knox: Mr Sneer, you
ain't never gonna get rich

17:44.696 --> 17:46.532
given away paintings.

17:46.532 --> 17:48.567
Money isn't
everything, Knox.

17:48.567 --> 17:50.135
The Pig:
I'm a socially

17:50.135 --> 17:52.237
acceptable philanthropist now

17:52.237 --> 17:53.972
and it didn't cost me anything.

17:55.507 --> 17:57.409
Don't think you're
off the hook yet.

17:57.409 --> 17:59.845
There's still a little
matter of the masterpieces

17:59.845 --> 18:02.247
I told you to get.
Where are they?

18:02.247 --> 18:04.116
The Pig: They're
drying now, Sir.

18:06.518 --> 18:08.620
So the
paintings are worthless?

18:08.620 --> 18:12.991
Oh heavens, no!
No work of art is worthless.

18:12.991 --> 18:15.727
You know, there's
something about them.

18:15.727 --> 18:19.364
Well, if they're not
prehistoric, who did them?

18:19.364 --> 18:21.567
Hey Broo, where you going?

18:21.567 --> 18:23.702
Come back here!

18:23.702 --> 18:26.271
Broo?!...Brooooooo!

18:26.271 --> 18:27.706
Come on, Cedric.

18:27.706 --> 18:29.041
He might need our help.

18:29.842 --> 18:34.346
Where have I seen
paintings like that before?

18:37.549 --> 18:38.750
Which way did he go?

18:38.750 --> 18:40.085
Broo?!

18:42.721 --> 18:45.858
Broo, come back!
There's monsters!!

18:45.858 --> 18:47.392
Brooooo!

18:52.698 --> 18:56.401
My little buddy, it's
got him! I gotta save him!

18:56.401 --> 18:57.636
Broooooo!

18:58.770 --> 19:00.606
Uaaaaah-oh!

19:00.606 --> 19:02.641
Uaaaaaaa!

19:05.544 --> 19:07.412
Melisaaaaaa!

19:07.412 --> 19:09.414
Do something!

19:09.414 --> 19:11.650
Hold on, Bert! Hold on!!

19:11.650 --> 19:13.852
Oh, Cedric,
what do we do?

19:16.054 --> 19:17.556
Uaaaah!

19:22.461 --> 19:24.429
Woof-woof!

19:24.429 --> 19:26.965
Uuuh! Oh, thanks, Melissa!

19:26.965 --> 19:28.934
Cedric, that was...

19:28.934 --> 19:32.171
t-th-the-the monster!!!!

19:32.171 --> 19:34.006
I am no monster!

19:34.006 --> 19:36.375
I am already Henri de la Possum,

19:36.375 --> 19:38.443
artiste extraordinaire.

19:39.611 --> 19:41.780
And by the way, a genius.

19:43.015 --> 19:44.183
Uaaaah!
Woof!

19:44.183 --> 19:47.519
Oh! And my dog, Rubens.

19:47.519 --> 19:50.856
So that's what
you were smelling, Broo!

19:50.856 --> 19:52.691
Another dog.

19:52.691 --> 19:54.693
Henri de la Possum?!

19:54.693 --> 19:58.163
But I read that you
disappeared five years ago.

19:58.163 --> 19:59.598
Of course I did!

19:59.598 --> 20:02.868
Ze artist cannot
create things above.

20:02.868 --> 20:06.205
Here I have privacy and...

20:06.205 --> 20:08.473
a monster to make sure of it.

20:08.473 --> 20:10.108
A good joke? No?

20:10.108 --> 20:13.278
No!! What are
you doing here anyway?

20:13.278 --> 20:16.949
My master piece.
I just finished it.

20:16.949 --> 20:18.116
Come and see.

20:20.919 --> 20:23.222
It's beautiful!

20:23.222 --> 20:26.225
Magnificent!

20:26.225 --> 20:28.961
Oh, amazing!

20:28.961 --> 20:30.996
But of course!

20:32.831 --> 20:35.167
Now my master piece is done.

20:35.167 --> 20:37.703
Rubens and I must move on.

20:37.703 --> 20:40.672
I have another waiting
project in mind.

20:40.672 --> 20:44.142
Sculpting El Mont Monte.

20:44.142 --> 20:45.711
Ho-ho-hooo!

20:45.711 --> 20:47.412
Enjoy it, my friends.

20:47.412 --> 20:49.681
Perhaps, we will meet again.

20:50.682 --> 20:51.717
Woof-woof!

20:56.588 --> 20:58.056
Oh boy,
oh boy, Melissa,

20:58.056 --> 21:01.460
have we got a story
or have we got a story?

21:04.630 --> 21:05.964
Well, my good son,

21:05.964 --> 21:07.399
at least I've got

21:07.399 --> 21:08.600
one great work of art.

21:08.600 --> 21:10.168
Yeah, Pop.

21:10.168 --> 21:12.938
But it's nowhere as good
as his cave paintings.

21:12.938 --> 21:14.539
Cave paintings?

21:14.539 --> 21:17.576
In the caverns,
the ones you gave away.

21:17.576 --> 21:20.178
It's covered in
Henri de la Possum.

21:20.178 --> 21:24.049
He's been painting there
for five years. I met him.

21:24.049 --> 21:26.018
It's all right here.

21:26.018 --> 21:27.953
You should come and see it, Pop.

21:27.953 --> 21:30.188
It's free, thanks to you.

21:30.188 --> 21:32.257
The Pig: They're dry now, Sir.

21:32.257 --> 21:35.060
The Pig 2: We really
outdid ourselves this time.

21:35.060 --> 21:39.197
The Pig 3: Henri de la Possum
has nothing on us, Sir.

21:42.601 --> 21:43.969
The Pig 1: We've been framed.
