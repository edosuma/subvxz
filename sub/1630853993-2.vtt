WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:06.160
This programme contains
strong language and some violent
scenes from the start.

00:06.160 --> 00:08.960
Who's your victim?
Edison Yao. Chinese national.
Assassinated in his apartment.

00:08.960 --> 00:11.320
He had CCTV all over the flat, only
the shooters are nowhere to be seen.

00:11.320 --> 00:13.960
I thought you might have
some...insight.

00:13.960 --> 00:15.440
I can't do this, I'm sorry.

00:15.440 --> 00:18.240
No, I get it.
Can't beat 'em, join 'em, right?

00:18.240 --> 00:20.120
Xanda Facial Recognition.

00:20.120 --> 00:22.240
The only security system
in the world

00:22.240 --> 00:25.000
to identify a human face
with 100% accuracy.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.560
Chinese AI technology
poses no threat.

00:27.560 --> 00:30.560
Yeah, I read the propaganda -
sorry, press release.

00:30.560 --> 00:33.600
As long as I'm Security Minister,
Britain's borders won't be monitored

00:33.600 --> 00:36.200
by a storefront for
the People's Republic of China.

00:38.640 --> 00:40.440
Ma'am? I've got something.

00:40.440 --> 00:42.920
CCTV threw up some...concerns.

00:42.920 --> 00:45.800
Our kind of concerns.
Pass on the details.

00:45.800 --> 00:47.360
I'll assign someone to take a look.

00:47.360 --> 00:50.400
Garland doesn't trust me, still.

00:50.400 --> 00:53.160
I signed up to be part of this.

00:53.160 --> 00:56.600
The Lagos care worker claims
her three-year-old son's father

00:56.600 --> 00:59.040
is Britain's Security Minister,
Isaac Turner.

00:59.040 --> 01:01.360
What?! This is them. This is Xanda.

01:01.360 --> 01:03.560
If we wanted to meddle, Mr Turner,

01:03.560 --> 01:06.200
do you think this is the best
we can do?

01:06.200 --> 01:08.640
Good afternoon,
distinguished members

01:08.640 --> 01:10.720
of the China Research Committee,

01:10.720 --> 01:12.720
and Gregory.

01:10.720 --> 01:12.720
CHUCKLING

01:12.720 --> 01:15.040
Not everybody is present
for the final vote.

01:15.040 --> 01:17.000
Where is Edison?

01:17.000 --> 01:19.680
The victim's last activity
was an attempted call.

01:19.680 --> 01:21.440
Maybe he was trying to warn someone.

01:21.440 --> 01:23.560
Caller ID?
Saved on the phone as Knox.

01:23.560 --> 01:27.800
Gregory Knox? There are armed
intruders in the building. Get in.

01:28.960 --> 01:31.440
GUNFIRE

01:28.960 --> 01:31.440
No, I haven't joined them,

01:31.440 --> 01:33.680
I am trying to beat them!

01:33.680 --> 01:36.160
And they are watching me
day and night!

01:36.160 --> 01:37.920
What's the status
with the committee?

01:37.920 --> 01:39.320
All assets are in safe houses.

01:39.320 --> 01:42.800
For all we know, the safe houses
are exactly where they want us
to take these people!

01:42.800 --> 01:46.120
Well, I'm now joined by Home Office
Security Minister Isaac Turner.

01:46.120 --> 01:48.240
Good evening, Khadija.

01:48.240 --> 01:51.200
This is it,
the reason they wanted you.

01:51.200 --> 01:55.880
I believe the right decision
is to award the UK borders contract

01:55.880 --> 01:57.840
to Xanda Facial Recognition.

02:01.840 --> 02:03.800
FAINT MEDIA BROADCAST

02:10.240 --> 02:12.920
..our security or our way of life.

02:12.920 --> 02:15.880
This decision will come as
a surprise to those who see you

02:15.880 --> 02:20.040
as a strong opponent to China's
investment in UK infrastructure.

02:20.040 --> 02:22.680
Oh, Khadija, I've always maintained
I keep an open mind.

02:22.680 --> 02:24.240
What is he doing?!

02:24.240 --> 02:27.280
I don't know. He's literally
quoting Xanda's press release.

02:27.280 --> 02:30.120
My phones are exploding, Guardian's
hounding me for a follow-up,

02:30.120 --> 02:32.200
he isn't even off air!
Did he say anything to you?

02:32.200 --> 02:35.040
Did he say anything about endorsing
the company he accused of spying?

02:35.040 --> 02:38.640
He must be scared. Edison's been
killed, Knox has been targeted.

02:38.640 --> 02:41.680
PHONE RINGS

02:38.640 --> 02:41.680
Oh, Christ, his wife's calling.

02:38.640 --> 02:41.680
Wait.

02:43.240 --> 02:45.560
Simone?
Aliza, are you watching this?

02:45.560 --> 02:47.480
Yeah. Are you OK?

02:47.480 --> 02:49.960
Yeah, I think so.
We've got police here.

02:49.960 --> 02:52.760
Why are you asking?  No, it's just,
we don't get it either.

02:52.760 --> 02:55.640
PHONE VIBRATES
Sorry, Simone, can I call you back?

02:55.640 --> 02:58.800
The programme hasn't been tested
for racial bias.

02:58.800 --> 03:02.200
Sadly, there are a number of facial
rec systems that underperform

03:02.200 --> 03:05.920
when it comes to accurately
identifying people of colour,

03:05.920 --> 03:07.720
which is totally unacceptable,
of course.

03:07.720 --> 03:09.600
MAN ON PHONE:  Has he had a stroke?

03:09.600 --> 03:11.800
Gregory! Shouldn't you be
in a safe house?

03:11.800 --> 03:14.800
I am. I had to plead with the police
to let me use their phone.

03:14.800 --> 03:18.640
I thought Turner told the Home Sec
we unanimously opposed to Xanda?

03:18.640 --> 03:19.880
We think he's scared.

03:19.880 --> 03:22.240
The way to safeguard against
racial profiling

03:22.240 --> 03:25.600
is to choose a recognition system
that's virtually 100% accurate.

03:25.600 --> 03:27.760
And Xanda gives us
that peace of mind.

03:27.760 --> 03:29.280
He doesn't look scared.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.920
If you're refusing to March down
to the BBC and get some answers...

03:40.920 --> 03:43.520
I must insist...
..I will do it myself!

03:43.520 --> 03:44.920
..insist you stay on lockdown!

03:44.920 --> 03:47.040
Zach? You know Commander Hart.

03:48.840 --> 03:50.480
Home Secretary.  Gemma.

03:51.520 --> 03:53.640
You were watching, then?  Newsnight?

03:53.640 --> 03:56.280
If I wanted to watch the Government
get its teeth kicked in,

03:56.280 --> 03:58.440
I'd turn up to PMQs.

03:58.440 --> 04:01.200
Must have been a shock, Minister.
A shock?

04:01.200 --> 04:02.640
No, not quite, Danny.

04:02.640 --> 04:05.840
Turning on the TV to see yourself
on a normal day is a shock.

04:05.840 --> 04:09.120
Turning on the TV to see yourself
when it's not yourself,

04:09.120 --> 04:11.960
saying the exact opposite
of what you fundamentally believe

04:11.960 --> 04:15.400
is a fucking mind-rape,
if you want to know the truth.

04:18.600 --> 04:19.680
Gemma?

04:21.480 --> 04:25.760
Do you think we need to, um...pull
up the drawbridge?

04:28.560 --> 04:31.520
DI Latif, DCI Carey,
await further instruction outside.

04:31.520 --> 04:33.000
Ma'am, I...  On second thoughts,

04:33.000 --> 04:35.160
DCI Carey, you don't need to wait,
you're dismissed.

04:35.160 --> 04:38.680
Report to Mapping per your
regular duties first thing.

04:38.680 --> 04:40.240
That's an interesting decision.

04:41.200 --> 04:44.360
I'm sorry?  You were the one who put
me on lockdown,

04:44.360 --> 04:46.120
which is exactly what they wanted.

04:46.120 --> 04:48.880
Detective Carey is the only one

04:48.880 --> 04:51.320
who managed to fathom
something was wrong here.

04:52.640 --> 04:56.720
Perhaps DCI Carey should stay,
given she's fully conversant.

05:04.880 --> 05:06.800
What are we going to do?

05:06.800 --> 05:10.280
Thanks to this...whatever it is,

05:10.280 --> 05:12.680
the nation is now
under the impression

05:12.680 --> 05:14.680
that I'm happy to farm out
facial rec

05:14.680 --> 05:17.240
to the same hostile foreign power
that orchestrated this.

05:17.240 --> 05:19.360
You're convinced
China's responsible?

05:19.360 --> 05:22.120
Beijing is trying to meddle
in British policy.

05:22.120 --> 05:24.720
Yan Wanglei is Xanda's man
in London.

05:24.720 --> 05:26.320
He's a part of it, I'm certain.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.600
We need to call a COBRA meeting,
obviously.

05:30.600 --> 05:33.720
SIS and the MoD should begin
drafting options immediately.

05:33.720 --> 05:35.720
We'll need a raft to formulate
our response,

05:35.720 --> 05:39.080
but first and foremost,
I would like to pay a visit

05:39.080 --> 05:40.520
to Broadcasting House.

05:45.960 --> 05:47.720
I managed to delay him.

05:51.280 --> 05:52.720
HE SIGHS

05:53.720 --> 05:56.840
There's a reason I can't let you
do that, Isaac.

05:58.560 --> 06:00.880
If you go running off to the BBC,

06:00.880 --> 06:02.920
it'll end up all over the news.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.240
Yes, Rowan, I was rather hoping
it might.

06:12.520 --> 06:14.240
Your decision, Home Secretary.

06:15.360 --> 06:16.960
Well, I think we'd better.

06:18.520 --> 06:20.280
Poor bloke's been through enough.

06:22.560 --> 06:25.480
We ought to remind you, sir,
that as a Government minister,

06:25.480 --> 06:27.760
you are bound by
the Official Secrets Act.

06:27.760 --> 06:29.920
I'm sor...
Is someone kindly going to tell me

06:29.920 --> 06:31.920
what the hell
you're all talking about?

06:33.240 --> 06:34.760
Yes.

06:36.160 --> 06:37.760
DCI Carey can explain it...

06:39.120 --> 06:41.120
..given she's fully conversant.

06:44.400 --> 06:46.840
Come on, Rachel,
we're all sitting comfortably.

06:46.840 --> 06:50.440
Why don't you tell Mr Turner
everything he needs to know...

06:51.920 --> 06:53.400
..about Correction?

07:45.320 --> 07:47.440
We'll be back, of course,
same time tomorrow.

07:47.440 --> 07:50.280
Until then, from all of us,
goodnight.

07:50.280 --> 07:51.880
We're clear.

07:53.040 --> 07:56.080
The Turner interview is causing
a sizeable Twitter storm.

07:56.080 --> 07:58.360
Certainly wasn't expecting him
to say that.

07:58.360 --> 08:00.280
#Isaacturncoat.

08:00.280 --> 08:01.760
What was he thinking?!

08:01.760 --> 08:03.720
I have a feeling we'll be
following this one up.

08:03.720 --> 08:05.560
Try to get him into the studio
next time.

08:05.560 --> 08:08.600
Remote interviews depress me
these days. Do you know what I mean?

08:08.600 --> 08:13.280
Uh-huh.  It might help if they didn't
lag and freeze like it was 1996!

08:13.280 --> 08:16.720
There shouldn't be any lagging.
Ed, you saw the lagging, right?

08:16.720 --> 08:18.440
Yeah, absolutely.

08:18.440 --> 08:21.760
Sometimes I think I'm the only one
actually watching around here.

08:23.560 --> 08:26.440
There shouldn't be any lagging.
Have a look into it, will you?

08:28.680 --> 08:32.200
So, it has a name,
what happened to me?

08:35.880 --> 08:40.240
Correction...is a method of
real-time image manipulation,

08:40.240 --> 08:42.320
using the disruption of camera feeds

08:42.320 --> 08:45.440
and the deployment
of deepfake technology.

08:45.440 --> 08:47.600
The technique was developed
in China,

08:47.600 --> 08:49.440
but its usage has spread to...

08:51.600 --> 08:52.880
..other regions.

08:54.040 --> 08:55.640
What regions?

08:58.280 --> 09:00.960
The map is constantly evolving,
but it's safe to assume

09:00.960 --> 09:03.760
Correction is in operation
in Russia, United States...

09:03.760 --> 09:05.200
The United Kingdom.

09:09.040 --> 09:11.000
Why would it be in operation here?

09:15.240 --> 09:19.160
For instance, if we have intel
on a terrorist plot,

09:19.160 --> 09:22.000
but the evidence against
the suspects is insufficient.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.240
If you can't put them away
fair and square,

09:24.240 --> 09:26.280
you fake incriminating footage?

09:28.840 --> 09:31.960
We turn intelligence into evidence.

09:37.880 --> 09:39.280
Who knows about this?

09:39.280 --> 09:42.040
It's a highly-restricted
operational tactic.

09:42.040 --> 09:46.720
No more than 50 operatives across
SO15, GCHQ and the Security Service.

09:46.720 --> 09:50.560
But who else?
The Justice Secretary? The PM?

09:50.560 --> 09:53.000
You know I can't confirm or deny.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.080
The British state
creating deep fakes?

09:57.960 --> 10:02.200
We only ever produce images
of events we know to be true.

10:08.360 --> 10:10.160
ISAAC LAUGHS

10:08.360 --> 10:10.160
This is... Huh!

10:10.160 --> 10:13.400
No. No, no, no,
this isn't happening.

10:18.640 --> 10:22.280
If it makes a difference,
this did not start on my watch.

10:23.480 --> 10:27.080
This moral minestrone
was gifted to me by my predecessor.

10:29.280 --> 10:30.320
So, why me?

10:31.680 --> 10:34.400
Where does this aberration
come into it?

10:34.400 --> 10:39.160
Sadly, with the means to create
false images of powerful people,

10:39.160 --> 10:42.800
Correction has become a tool
for disinformation.

10:42.800 --> 10:47.160
Correction is the dirty secret
we share with our adversaries.

10:47.160 --> 10:49.880
We can all deploy it covertly,

10:49.880 --> 10:52.880
but if one country accuses another
publicly,

10:52.880 --> 10:55.480
we may as well blow the whistle
on ourselves.

11:02.160 --> 11:04.000
So, what are you saying?

11:04.000 --> 11:07.080
If we were to claim your appearance
was corrected,

11:07.080 --> 11:09.880
it would leave us vulnerable
to counter-accusations.

11:09.880 --> 11:13.400
And then, the whole global
house of cards comes tumbling down.

11:15.240 --> 11:18.240
You...you expect me to keep
my mouth shut

11:18.240 --> 11:20.880
and let the world believe
that malicious bullshit was real?

11:20.880 --> 11:22.960
I'm sorry, Isaac.
Edison Yao is dead!

11:22.960 --> 11:27.080
They are killing dissidents and
attacking our national broadcasts!

11:27.080 --> 11:29.200
These are acts of
state-sponsored terror!

11:29.200 --> 11:32.000
For which, appropriate action
will be taken.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.440
So long as it doesn't upset
some spook programme?!

11:35.440 --> 11:38.160
So long as it doesn't upset
the Government,

11:38.160 --> 11:40.840
the courts, MI5 and the police.

11:42.720 --> 11:44.280
Good enough?

11:49.480 --> 11:51.680
Let's hope we can rely
on the Right Honourable Member

11:51.680 --> 11:53.960
for Haslemere South
to keep his trap shut.

11:53.960 --> 11:56.920
We keep Isaac Turner on a short
leash. Close protection officers,

11:56.920 --> 11:58.880
intercepts and monitoring
on all devices.

11:58.880 --> 12:01.120
Same goes for his staff.
They arranged that interview.

12:01.120 --> 12:02.840
Any one of them could be complicit.

12:02.840 --> 12:04.360
Do you see Correction like that?

12:07.920 --> 12:10.240
Turner's right, we're looking at
the most blatant attack

12:10.240 --> 12:11.960
by a foreign power since Salisbury.

12:13.320 --> 12:17.720
What do you need?  Tight team,
SO15, GCHQ and CIA to support.

12:17.720 --> 12:19.600
Who do you want on your team?

12:21.720 --> 12:24.040
Rachel certainly made an impression
on Turner.

12:25.120 --> 12:26.600
Wouldn't hurt to keep him onside.

12:26.600 --> 12:29.680
You seem to forget how close
she came to reporting us.

12:29.680 --> 12:31.400
That was before you won her over.

12:33.240 --> 12:35.240
Not to mention what we found.

12:36.480 --> 12:39.560
That was insurance.
You'd do the same.

12:40.640 --> 12:42.200
She's being watched, isn't she?

12:44.280 --> 12:45.640
Any concerns?

12:47.920 --> 12:50.400
If you still don't trust her, Gemma,
you know what to do.

12:53.400 --> 12:55.160
Keep her close.

12:56.640 --> 12:58.720
DOOR SLIDES OPEN AND SHUTS

13:03.240 --> 13:04.760
DOOR SLIDES SHUT

13:06.000 --> 13:08.800
I'll need a DCI to bridge Homicide
and SO15.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.840
If you're interested?  I am, Ma'am.

13:14.280 --> 13:17.040
You'll need assistance.
What do you make of the new blood?

13:17.040 --> 13:19.160
DC Tan?

13:19.160 --> 13:22.360
Couple of years ago, they'd have
called her fast-track princess.

13:22.360 --> 13:25.040
They did me.
I won't repeat what they called me.

13:28.360 --> 13:31.800
DI Latif, you have compromised
the location of a safe house.

13:31.800 --> 13:34.800
A security breach that may
warrant disciplinary action.

13:34.800 --> 13:36.880
But, Ma'am, I...
While a decision is pending,

13:36.880 --> 13:40.280
your inclusion in this operation is
suspended with immediate effect.

13:40.280 --> 13:42.680
You may return to your departmental
duties,

13:42.680 --> 13:44.480
but your time with us ends here.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.400
Be thankful the repercussions
aren't more severe.

13:52.640 --> 13:54.240
Bring DC Tan in with you.

13:54.240 --> 13:57.040
In where, Ma'am?

13:57.040 --> 13:58.960
Seventh floor.

13:58.960 --> 14:00.520
What about Mapping?

14:02.000 --> 14:03.440
Mapping runs itself.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.720
Well, you WANTED to take over
my case.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.160
Got what you wished for.

14:41.160 --> 14:43.280
FAINT MEDIA BROADCAST

14:44.280 --> 14:46.160
DEVICE BEEPS

14:59.840 --> 15:02.200
This is DCI Rachel Carey.

15:02.200 --> 15:04.280
In place of hidden camera recording,

15:04.280 --> 15:07.360
I'm filming this eyewitness
testimony for my dossier

15:07.360 --> 15:10.200
detailing the systematic
illegal practice

15:10.200 --> 15:13.760
of video-evidence tampering
known as Correction.

15:13.760 --> 15:16.560
Approximately one hour ago,

15:16.560 --> 15:20.360
I was present at a briefing
with Home Secretary Rowan Gill,

15:20.360 --> 15:23.200
who I learned has full knowledge
of Correction

15:23.200 --> 15:24.800
and its use within the UK.

15:24.800 --> 15:28.880
Also present was the Security
Minister Isaac Turner, who...

15:30.440 --> 15:34.240
..until the briefing, had no prior
knowledge of Correction.

15:41.080 --> 15:42.720
Why couldn't you call me before?

15:44.240 --> 15:46.760
Er...security.

15:46.760 --> 15:48.840
Police insisted.

15:48.840 --> 15:52.760
So, you can go on Newsnight
and talk to Khadija Khan,

15:52.760 --> 15:54.440
but you can't call your wife?

15:54.440 --> 15:56.200
I wasn't...

15:56.200 --> 15:57.960
I wasn't on Newsnight.

15:57.960 --> 15:59.880
You know what I mean.

15:59.880 --> 16:01.560
Remotely.

16:04.920 --> 16:06.640
Why did you change your mind?

16:08.400 --> 16:10.360
About the facial-rec contract?

16:12.360 --> 16:14.600
I can't talk about it, Simmy.

16:16.200 --> 16:19.800
You said "people of colour",
by the way.

16:19.800 --> 16:22.480
I thought you didn't like
that phrase?

16:24.560 --> 16:27.520
You always said it sounded too close
to "coloured people".

16:30.360 --> 16:32.040
You did good, though,

16:32.040 --> 16:33.760
in the interview.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.280
Oh, yeah?

16:35.280 --> 16:37.120
Not what you said, just...

16:38.560 --> 16:39.960
..the way you said it.

16:41.600 --> 16:45.040
You sounded...authoritative.

16:49.320 --> 16:50.920
HE SIGHS DEEPLY

16:53.560 --> 16:55.000
I want the truth, Isaac.

16:56.440 --> 16:58.640
The people who tried to kill
Gregory Knox...

17:00.400 --> 17:02.520
..are they going to try to kill you?
No. No, no.

17:02.520 --> 17:03.800
The truth.

17:05.280 --> 17:06.560
HE SIGHS

17:07.960 --> 17:09.400
I don't know.

17:11.200 --> 17:13.160
Turns out there's a lot
I don't know.

17:23.400 --> 17:25.520
BEEPING, WHIRRING

17:39.160 --> 17:40.880
RAPID BEEPING

18:14.360 --> 18:17.440
The priorities of Operation Vanguard
are as follows.

18:17.440 --> 18:20.200
To investigate a series
of targeted assassinations

18:20.200 --> 18:22.600
across the capital
in the past 36 hours,

18:22.600 --> 18:25.400
to identify the prime suspects

18:25.400 --> 18:28.440
and to gather intelligence
on a campaign of cyberattacks

18:28.440 --> 18:30.480
against UK surveillance networks

18:30.480 --> 18:32.400
and a major television broadcaster.

18:34.040 --> 18:38.360
This blatant attack
on UK infrastructure and civilians

18:38.360 --> 18:41.440
is one of the most heinous
I've come across.

18:41.440 --> 18:44.760
Not least because they've hurt
one of our own.

18:44.760 --> 18:47.560
It is our assessment
that this chain of attacks

18:47.560 --> 18:49.920
was coordinated
with a hack on the BBC

18:49.920 --> 18:52.920
in a plot to affect government
policy by a hostile foreign power.

18:54.200 --> 18:57.800
While the trawl for any trace
of the murder suspects continues,

18:57.800 --> 19:01.160
Turner himself alerted us
to this person of interest.

19:01.160 --> 19:04.080
As London CEO of Xanda Facial Rec,

19:04.080 --> 19:08.080
Yan Wanglei has the motive
and the technical capability.

19:08.080 --> 19:10.880
Now, given his status
as a high-profile Chinese national,

19:10.880 --> 19:13.920
I need hardly tell you how carefully
we need to tread here.

19:13.920 --> 19:17.520
Any arrest will constitute
a major international incident.

19:17.520 --> 19:19.840
But make no mistake,
we will arrest him

19:19.840 --> 19:21.680
if that's where the evidence
leads us.

19:21.680 --> 19:24.920
We've reached out respectfully
to Mr Wanglei this morning,

19:24.920 --> 19:27.760
and he's accepted our invitation
to be questioned.

19:27.760 --> 19:30.600
Provided it takes place
at the Chinese Embassy

19:30.600 --> 19:33.200
in the presence
of Ambassador Xiaodong.

19:33.200 --> 19:37.000
Anyone care to guess the POI's
current location?

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
Chinese Embassy?

19:39.000 --> 19:41.840
Thank God you're here, Carey,
finally.

19:41.840 --> 19:43.400
Hmm.

19:43.400 --> 19:46.360
Yes, he's tucked away
at the embassy.

19:46.360 --> 19:49.440
Let's take him up on his offer.
I'll pay the ambassador a visit.

19:49.440 --> 19:53.640
If this came from Beijing, there's
reasonable grounds he's complicit.

19:53.640 --> 19:56.400
I could come...to the embassy...

19:57.640 --> 19:59.320
..if it helps.

19:59.320 --> 20:00.960
Do you speak Mandarin?

20:00.960 --> 20:02.400
No.

20:02.400 --> 20:04.040
A couple of words.

20:04.040 --> 20:05.440
Then, why...?

20:06.960 --> 20:09.200
Well...just...

20:10.480 --> 20:12.120
Isn't that a bit...?

20:12.120 --> 20:14.320
I think that's a good idea, DC Tan.

20:14.320 --> 20:16.480
Chloe.  I'll need the support.

20:19.480 --> 20:21.680
Agreed. Excuse me.

20:25.280 --> 20:26.760
Rachel?

20:28.680 --> 20:31.840
..to China was like handing
a British radar contract

20:31.840 --> 20:34.000
to Germany in 1939.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.280
I've done my research, I found
no evidence of a link between Xanda

20:37.280 --> 20:39.240
and the Chinese authorities.

20:39.240 --> 20:42.800
As Britain's Security Minister,
I fully support the CRC's...

20:42.800 --> 20:44.600
HE STOPS VIDEO

20:47.440 --> 20:51.040
Remote interview via webcam.
All the perps would need to do is

20:51.040 --> 20:53.440
pipe in their feed to the BBC.

20:53.440 --> 20:56.160
Any remote camera has
the potential to be hacked.

20:58.280 --> 21:01.440
Interaction with the host, seamless.

21:02.600 --> 21:04.520
You suspect her involvement?

21:04.520 --> 21:06.960
Isn't it customary to send the kids
to bed

21:06.960 --> 21:08.960
when the grown-ups are talking?

21:08.960 --> 21:12.400
DCI Carey has the same right
to be here as any of us.

21:12.400 --> 21:16.080
What are you saying exactly -
Khadija Khan is complicit?

21:16.080 --> 21:20.280
Or the avatar can respond
to her questions in real time?

21:20.280 --> 21:24.000
Is it possible to create
a deepfake that sophisticated?

21:25.000 --> 21:30.040
Hmm? Oh. Well...we haven't
gotten there yet.

21:30.040 --> 21:31.880
If anyone has, it's China.

21:31.880 --> 21:34.640
I'd love to furnish you
with directions to their embassy.

21:34.640 --> 21:37.560
Why use the front door
when you can hack the mainframe?

21:37.560 --> 21:40.360
Oh, sorry, I can't help you there.

21:40.360 --> 21:43.680
Beg your pardon?  Strict orders
from the executive branch.

21:43.680 --> 21:47.560
The agency can no longer assist
in third-party counter-espionage

21:47.560 --> 21:49.880
against the People's Republic
of China.

21:49.880 --> 21:52.800
Why the hell not?!  Because you do
too much business with them,

21:52.800 --> 21:55.680
that's why! When we tell you not to
get into bed with Beijing,

21:55.680 --> 21:57.280
you bury deeper into the sheets!

21:57.280 --> 21:58.840
So, this is about money?

21:58.840 --> 22:00.560
It's about security!

22:00.560 --> 22:03.680
You know, we share a lot of intel
with the UK.

22:03.680 --> 22:06.280
I'd like to know
that China isn't listening.

22:07.760 --> 22:11.360
Message for you, ma'am. Anthony
Reid asked that you contact him.

22:11.360 --> 22:12.680
Oh.  He says it's urgent.

22:12.680 --> 22:14.960
Anthony Reid?  Yes.

22:14.960 --> 22:17.320
THE Anthony Reid?  Yes.

22:17.320 --> 22:20.800
Who the fuck's that?
Security correspondent for the BBC.

22:20.800 --> 22:22.440
It can't be a coincidence.

22:22.440 --> 22:25.000
Surely we need to investigate
there anyway?  I was hoping

22:25.000 --> 22:27.920
to keep this away from the press for
as long as humanly possible.

22:27.920 --> 22:30.840
Well, I'd like to stick around.

22:30.840 --> 22:33.680
Give me a call when your country
learns how to pick a side.

22:34.920 --> 22:36.320
Frank?!

22:40.320 --> 22:42.120
SHE BREATHES DEEPLY

22:43.440 --> 22:44.680
Frank!

22:44.680 --> 22:47.760
Look, if you need technical help
with the BBC,

22:47.760 --> 22:49.680
I'll loan you one of my guys.

22:49.680 --> 22:52.560
But if I find out you put them
on China, the deal's off.

22:54.880 --> 22:57.920
Since when did Frank Napier let
politicians call the shots?

23:00.360 --> 23:02.760
Since I found out
they were watching me.

23:06.080 --> 23:07.360
Ma'am?

23:09.600 --> 23:12.200
Like thousands of visa applicants
around the globe,

23:12.200 --> 23:15.560
Victoria Bello dreams of living
and working in the UK.

23:15.560 --> 23:18.000
This landed in Rhys Edwards' inbox
yesterday.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
..care worker claims
her three-year-old son

23:20.000 --> 23:22.320
is eligible for a British passport.

23:22.320 --> 23:25.120
According to Victoria,
the child's father

23:25.120 --> 23:27.800
is Britain's Security Minister,
Isaac Turner.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.520
Has this gone public?
No trace of it online.

23:33.520 --> 23:35.880
According to the message frenzy
that followed,

23:35.880 --> 23:38.880
Turner seemed to think it was some
kind of blackmail attempt by Xanda.

23:38.880 --> 23:41.400
I'd like to know why he didn't
mention that to us.

23:41.400 --> 23:43.800
My thoughts exactly.

23:43.800 --> 23:45.080
Ma'am?

23:47.480 --> 23:49.600
Invite him in.

23:49.600 --> 23:51.040
Under armed protection.

23:52.920 --> 23:54.800
Same goes for his staff.

23:57.400 --> 23:59.280
So, this is where the magic happens?

24:01.080 --> 24:02.840
How DID they get you?

24:04.400 --> 24:06.120
Get me?

24:08.640 --> 24:09.880
Rachel?

24:21.840 --> 24:23.280
Rhys Edwards?

25:02.480 --> 25:03.920
Commander Hart.

25:03.920 --> 25:05.960
Ambassador.
Thank you for taking the time.

25:07.960 --> 25:09.600
This is Detective Tan.

25:09.600 --> 25:11.640
HE GREETS DETECTIVE TAN IN MANDARIN

25:11.640 --> 25:13.040
Pleased to meet you.

25:15.080 --> 25:18.000
Hmm! Please, our guest is waiting.

25:20.440 --> 25:22.080
Seems a long time since you threw

25:22.080 --> 25:24.160
one of your famous soirees,
Ambassador.

25:24.160 --> 25:25.640
Whatever happened to those?

25:25.640 --> 25:27.680
Your country accused us of genocide.

25:29.240 --> 25:30.720
Fair enough.

25:35.320 --> 25:38.360
Edison Yao was a dissident
from Hong Kong.

25:38.360 --> 25:42.280
About 36 hours ago,
someone came to his apartment

25:42.280 --> 25:43.960
and put a bullet through his eye.

25:45.520 --> 25:47.160
How is he now?

25:57.280 --> 25:58.640
That's awful,

25:58.640 --> 26:01.880
but would you mind explaining
what it has to do with me?

26:01.880 --> 26:04.080
Mr Yao served on the China Research
Committee,

26:04.080 --> 26:07.640
advising the Government on your
company's facial recognition bid.

26:09.360 --> 26:13.880
24 hours later, security guard
Joseph Mwangi was shot in the neck

26:13.880 --> 26:17.040
and a police detective sergeant
was shot in the chest.

26:18.880 --> 26:20.960
Were they on the China Research
Committee?

26:20.960 --> 26:23.360
We believe the intended target was.

26:23.360 --> 26:26.000
A data scientist named Gregory Knox.

26:26.000 --> 26:30.680
In each case, the bullet was
discharged from a QSZ-92 automatic.

26:30.680 --> 26:35.080
A military-issue firearm
manufactured in mainland China.

26:35.080 --> 26:38.320
No surprise to find products
in the UK made in China.

26:38.320 --> 26:41.640
No, not when it comes to technology.
Computers...

26:41.640 --> 26:44.560
Metal, minerals, plastics.
Medical equipment.

26:44.560 --> 26:47.840
But military-grade weapons?
That's rare.

26:49.400 --> 26:52.160
China does not take revenge
on its dissidents

26:52.160 --> 26:55.200
and hunt them down on the streets
of Britain. We are not Russia.

26:56.920 --> 26:58.400
No-one mentioned revenge.

27:03.800 --> 27:05.400
I forgot to congratulate you both.

27:05.400 --> 27:09.120
Looks like the facial-rec contract
is going your way.

27:12.600 --> 27:14.040
I'm curious.

27:14.040 --> 27:17.760
Why do you think a minister known
for his stance against Chinese tech

27:17.760 --> 27:19.960
ended up going
with a Chinese company?

27:22.560 --> 27:24.760
Do you realise what you're implying,
young lady?

27:25.880 --> 27:27.560
DC Tan.

27:27.560 --> 27:29.240
Just asking.

27:30.560 --> 27:32.480
How very disappointing.

27:32.480 --> 27:34.600
Once again, we find ourselves

27:34.600 --> 27:37.680
the subject of baseless,
lurid allegations.

27:37.680 --> 27:40.480
China, the bogeyman of the world.

27:40.480 --> 27:42.160
We find it offensive.

27:42.160 --> 27:44.960
Just as we find it offensive,
Commander Hart,

27:44.960 --> 27:47.400
that you bring along a colleague
of Chinese descent

27:47.400 --> 27:49.440
to appease your brazen prejudice.

27:54.960 --> 27:57.080
I have another engagement.

27:57.080 --> 27:58.800
Perhaps we could continue this

27:58.800 --> 28:01.600
when you have something more
to go on besides bias?

28:04.680 --> 28:07.360
I'm sorry to hear about
your detective sergeant.

28:08.840 --> 28:11.800
You said he was shot,
but you didn't say if he survived.

28:14.080 --> 28:15.560
No, I didn't.

28:17.720 --> 28:21.760
Tom, I want a team car
watching the entrance 24/7.

28:21.760 --> 28:23.520
I'll assign the eyeball.

28:23.520 --> 28:26.080
How do you feel about joining
a surveillance unit?

28:26.080 --> 28:29.080
Sir, apart from basic undercover on
the fast-track, I don't have much

28:29.080 --> 28:32.080
experience.  Yeah, but you've seen
the target up close and personal.

28:32.080 --> 28:33.920
Ops and monitoring.

28:33.920 --> 28:36.760
We need verification.
Eyes on Yan Wanglei.

28:37.880 --> 28:39.120
Sir.

28:41.160 --> 28:42.440
About Nadia, Ma'am...

28:43.840 --> 28:45.560
DI Latif.

28:45.560 --> 28:48.760
She's not actually going to receive
disciplinary action, is she?

28:48.760 --> 28:52.640
Because she only breached
the safe house on my instruction.

28:53.840 --> 28:56.680
If you have the spare time or the
bandwidth to feel guilty about it,

28:56.680 --> 28:58.520
why don't you give her a call?

28:58.520 --> 29:00.200
Better yet, send flowers.

29:00.200 --> 29:03.800
In the meantime,
I'd appreciate your focus.

29:03.800 --> 29:05.440
Yes, Ma'am.

29:10.480 --> 29:12.840
So, how do you want to play this,
then, Ma'am?

29:12.840 --> 29:14.280
Just listen and learn.

29:14.280 --> 29:16.760
Gem!  Anthony!

29:16.760 --> 29:18.600
Thank you for coming to us.

29:18.600 --> 29:21.600
I've booked somewhere
we can't be overlooked.

29:27.960 --> 29:31.160
I imagine you've seen
the Isaac Turner interview.

29:31.160 --> 29:32.720
He's pro-Xanda now.

29:32.720 --> 29:36.320
Yes. Pretty surprising U-turn,
even by this Government's standards.

29:36.320 --> 29:39.240
Got us wondering if China
has something on Turner.

29:40.440 --> 29:42.880
Until we chanced upon
a different theory.

29:45.000 --> 29:48.440
Khadija complained about the
remote connection speed last night.

29:48.440 --> 29:49.680
Nothing odd about that.

29:49.680 --> 29:52.240
Khadija complains about something
MOST nights.

29:52.240 --> 29:55.480
But when the engineers
tracked Turner's IP address,

29:55.480 --> 29:57.680
they discovered something strange.

29:57.680 --> 29:59.920
The signal wasn't coming from
London.

29:59.920 --> 30:02.480
Wasn't coming from the UK at all.

30:02.480 --> 30:04.000
It was coming from China.

30:06.240 --> 30:08.040
Care to share any insights?

30:10.400 --> 30:12.480
You're right to bring this
to our attention.

30:12.480 --> 30:15.560
I suggest we arrange a discreet unit
to investigate.

30:15.560 --> 30:18.400
Rachel, with a member
of our technical team.

30:18.400 --> 30:21.560
Provided you're willing
to share any findings with us.

30:21.560 --> 30:23.880
We plan to run this
as soon as possible.

30:25.040 --> 30:26.400
Run?  The story.

30:27.760 --> 30:30.800
Is there one?  We know that Isaac
Turner wasn't in China last night,

30:30.800 --> 30:33.840
so clearly, we're looking at some
kind of foreign interference.

30:33.840 --> 30:37.040
We're juggling theories,
from hacking to full-on deep fakes.

30:37.040 --> 30:41.080
It is remarkable that Turner said
exactly what Xanda wanted him to.

30:43.880 --> 30:46.920
Of all the stories on our radar
involving that particular minister,

30:46.920 --> 30:48.440
I'd shelve this one if I were you.

30:48.440 --> 30:50.240
Because...?

30:50.240 --> 30:52.760
Because the BBC needs to maintain
its reputation

30:52.760 --> 30:55.200
as a trusted news source,
not a beacon of disinformation.

30:55.200 --> 30:57.120
Yes, we've discussed this conundrum.

30:57.120 --> 31:00.000
If we report it, we risk
undermining our credibility.

31:00.000 --> 31:03.200
But if we don't and it gets out,
that would be worse.

31:06.080 --> 31:08.080
Then let me spare you the dilemma.

31:08.080 --> 31:10.640
Already, this raises
a number of concerns.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.240
I'm sure I can count on
your cooperation.

31:16.120 --> 31:18.640
Hold the story while we investigate.

31:18.640 --> 31:20.600
Well, so long as you can
enlighten us

31:20.600 --> 31:23.720
on those concerns
while we investigate.

31:23.720 --> 31:25.560
I'm afraid I can't do that.

31:25.560 --> 31:28.680
Well, then, I'm afraid I can't allow
you to sniff around our studio.

31:28.680 --> 31:30.280
We'll come back with a warrant.

31:32.680 --> 31:35.240
You've just alerted us
to a suspected cyber attack

31:35.240 --> 31:38.200
by a foreign power. That makes
your studio a crime scene.

31:38.200 --> 31:40.880
If we don't investigate,
it'll be dereliction of duty.

31:40.880 --> 31:43.000
It'll leave you vulnerable
to further attacks.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.840
You won't get your story anyway.

31:44.840 --> 31:46.080
I don't know.

31:46.080 --> 31:49.560
What with the IP address and
the tech correspondent's analysis,

31:49.560 --> 31:52.000
I can see seven minutes
shaping up nicely.

31:55.040 --> 31:56.720
You're leaving us
with no alternative.

31:57.960 --> 31:59.640
You can't broadcast it.

31:59.640 --> 32:01.520
We'll slap a D-notice on it.

32:01.520 --> 32:03.960
A D-notice to Khadija Khan?

32:05.080 --> 32:06.800
Red rag, bull.

32:06.800 --> 32:08.920
You'll have to do more than that
to bring her onside.

32:08.920 --> 32:11.680
Come on, Gem, you know the deal.

32:11.680 --> 32:14.600
If you're going to use
the nuclear option,

32:14.600 --> 32:16.720
you've got to offer up a sweetener.

32:16.720 --> 32:19.080
You mentioned other stories.

32:21.200 --> 32:22.760
About the minister.

32:33.800 --> 32:36.600
"Fearing for my safety
and the safety of my family,

32:36.600 --> 32:40.920
"I...I decided to alter my position
on Xanda Facial Recognition."

32:40.920 --> 32:42.600
This is how you want me to play it -

32:42.600 --> 32:44.760
that I was intimidated
into changing my mind?

32:44.760 --> 32:47.360
You need an explanation
for your staff, your wife.

32:47.360 --> 32:49.640
I don't lie to my wife.

32:49.640 --> 32:51.080
Of course.

32:52.720 --> 32:56.240
Ah. Thanks for coming in to see us,
Minister. Why don't you take a seat?

32:56.240 --> 32:58.560
I appreciate you keeping me updated,
sir.

32:58.560 --> 33:00.320
What can you give me?

33:00.320 --> 33:02.080
You're looking into Xanda, right?

33:02.080 --> 33:05.240
We are running multiple lines
of inquiry, of course.

33:05.240 --> 33:08.360
And my team, you're talking to my
team - Aliza Clark, Rhys Edwards?

33:08.360 --> 33:09.840
They're helping us, yeah.

33:09.840 --> 33:12.200
Have you heard from the Home Office?
I certainly haven't.

33:12.200 --> 33:14.520
Might you be more comfortable
sitting down, Minister?

33:14.520 --> 33:18.400
No, not really, Danny. I have been
cooped in a safe house all night.

33:18.400 --> 33:20.920
We just need to ask you
a few questions, sir.

33:22.520 --> 33:23.760
OK.

33:32.080 --> 33:35.160
How...how long have you known
Aliza Clark?  Aliza?

33:35.160 --> 33:38.000
I was with Rhys and Isaac last night

33:38.000 --> 33:40.280
when we agreed to do
the Newsnight interview.

33:41.880 --> 33:44.120
Rhys went off to...
She's been with me since,

33:44.120 --> 33:46.560
well, since I became
Security Minister. A year.

33:46.560 --> 33:48.680
What do you know
about her private life?

33:49.720 --> 33:52.480
I'm not sure she has one.
I imagine there's a cat.

33:52.480 --> 33:54.680
Hmm! What about Rhys Edwards?

33:54.680 --> 33:57.360
I set up the interview, tried to
confirm it with Isaac,

33:57.360 --> 34:00.720
couldn't get through. Honestly,
I don't know what else to tell you.

34:00.720 --> 34:03.240
He's a decent spad.
He's public-school prat,

34:03.240 --> 34:05.240
but I'm in government,
I'm surrounded by them.

34:05.240 --> 34:08.240
Are you aware of any reason
either Clark or Edwards

34:08.240 --> 34:10.600
could have been compromised?

34:10.600 --> 34:13.640
Compromised?  Well, anything
that may have left them vulnerable

34:13.640 --> 34:15.880
to bribery or blackmail.

34:17.440 --> 34:19.480
Nothing in Westminster
would surprise me,

34:19.480 --> 34:23.200
but, no, I'm not aware of anything.
Why?

34:23.200 --> 34:27.560
The cyberattacks on the BBC
were coordinated so meticulously

34:27.560 --> 34:33.600
that it suggests the collusion
of one or more members of your team.

34:33.600 --> 34:35.680
Aliza and Rhys?

34:35.680 --> 34:37.280
Or indeed yourself, Minister.

34:41.840 --> 34:43.400
I thought... Huh!

34:43.400 --> 34:46.600
I thought I was brought here
for an update. Am  I  under suspicion?

34:46.600 --> 34:49.320
Well, with cases involving
foreign intervention,

34:49.320 --> 34:53.440
it's not unusual to find
that victims have been...coerced.

34:54.520 --> 34:55.800
Blackmailed.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.160
What can you tell us
about Victoria Bello?

35:02.360 --> 35:04.440
LIFT DINGS

35:04.440 --> 35:06.640
Then you agree,
it was the right move?

35:08.120 --> 35:09.720
You planted the other story,

35:09.720 --> 35:12.240
then let them think finding it
was their idea.

35:12.240 --> 35:14.080
You got the result we needed, Ma'am.

35:15.640 --> 35:17.680
The minister in charge
of Britain's borders has

35:17.680 --> 35:19.400
a foreign lovechild trying
to get in.

35:19.400 --> 35:22.240
That story will come out sooner
or later, with or without our help.

35:24.240 --> 35:25.680
I imagine so.

35:32.640 --> 35:34.360
Have you been reading our emails?

35:34.360 --> 35:37.520
Any information you could provide us
would be extremely helpful.

35:39.960 --> 35:43.200
Er...my office received
some bogus report

35:43.200 --> 35:46.280
about a woman claiming
I'm the father of her child, but...

35:46.280 --> 35:49.680
it's all lies.  And you suspected
China was behind it?

35:49.680 --> 35:52.640
Yan Wanglei made some veiled threat
about spying.

35:52.640 --> 35:55.840
"Everybody has something", he said,
but he's wrong, I don't.

35:55.840 --> 35:59.640
You're saying that they made up the
lovechild story to blackmail you?

35:59.640 --> 36:02.160
Or to defame me, discredit me.

36:02.160 --> 36:05.680
China faked your announcement. Why
would they want to discredit you?

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
I-I don't know, Detective.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.280
I'd really love to leave the job
of figuring out

36:11.280 --> 36:13.200
exactly how and why China fucked us
to you,

36:13.200 --> 36:15.120
so I can get on with the job
of figuring out

36:15.120 --> 36:17.080
how the hell
the Government's meant to respond.

36:19.560 --> 36:21.520
I assume I'm free to leave?

36:21.520 --> 36:24.080
As long as you're accompanied
by protection officers.

36:24.080 --> 36:27.320
Um, I'd just like to ask
one last question.

36:27.320 --> 36:31.520
You didn't mention anything about
the lovechild allegation to us.

36:31.520 --> 36:32.800
Why is that?

36:32.800 --> 36:35.080
I wouldn't expect you to understand.

36:38.040 --> 36:40.360
Look, I don't want something
like this

36:40.360 --> 36:42.480
getting traction, even false.

36:43.760 --> 36:45.320
We can't have it out there.

36:48.600 --> 36:50.680
DOOR SHUTS

36:53.480 --> 36:55.040
I guess I'm in the right place.

36:55.040 --> 36:56.920
I was hoping it would be you.

36:56.920 --> 36:58.920
Rachel, Louie.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.920
Frank told me to remind you
of the parameters.

37:01.920 --> 37:03.960
Frank needs a fucking holiday.

37:07.400 --> 37:10.240
That is the longest I've been
without my phone.

37:10.240 --> 37:12.640
Since?  No, that was
the end of my sentence.

37:12.640 --> 37:14.200
So, what - how bad is it?

37:14.200 --> 37:16.960
Er...well, "Isaac U-turn"
is obviously trending.

37:16.960 --> 37:18.200
There's no shortage of hate.

37:18.200 --> 37:21.120
But until now, a lot of these people
didn't know who you were, so...

37:21.120 --> 37:24.160
Approval ratings down,
brand awareness up.

37:24.160 --> 37:26.240
You know, it's this level
of incompetence

37:26.240 --> 37:28.520
that reassures me neither of you
are involved.

37:28.520 --> 37:30.680
What about the PM -
any statement, or...?

37:30.680 --> 37:33.240
Nothing from Downing Street
or the Home Office.  Nothing?

37:33.240 --> 37:35.560
Oh, wait, there's a voice message
from McKenzie.

37:35.560 --> 37:37.400
Newsnight want you back on tonight.

37:38.800 --> 37:40.600
What? What do you want to say,
Aliza?

37:40.600 --> 37:42.720
I think we'd all
just like to know what happened.

37:42.720 --> 37:45.640
VOICEMAIL: You have
one new message...

37:45.640 --> 37:49.480
Fearing for my safety
and the safety of my family,

37:49.480 --> 37:53.160
I decided to alter my position
on Xanda Facial Recognition.

37:53.160 --> 37:55.560
I knew it. It's fair enough, Isaac.

37:55.560 --> 37:58.200
Hmm!  What? YOU don't know.
YOU don't have kids.

37:58.200 --> 38:01.200
Well, neither do you, unless YOU'RE
the one with the secret lovechild.

38:01.200 --> 38:03.680
Sorry, fake secret lovechild.

38:05.280 --> 38:07.640
That's the other thing,
they know about that, too.

38:07.640 --> 38:09.440
They're not the only ones.

38:12.120 --> 38:14.880
What did you have for breakfast,
Isaac?

38:14.880 --> 38:16.720
It was so long ago,
I can't remember.

38:16.720 --> 38:18.160
Thank you. Audio level's good.

38:18.160 --> 38:19.880
Do you normally do test recordings?

38:19.880 --> 38:23.440
Whenever we link up
to a new computer or a new location.

38:23.440 --> 38:27.000
When his spad said that Isaac Turner
wanted to do a remote interview,

38:27.000 --> 38:29.120
I assumed he meant from home.

38:29.120 --> 38:31.960
But then Turner called
and said he was in London.

38:31.960 --> 38:33.720
Isaac Turner called you himself?

38:34.760 --> 38:36.120
Yes.

38:36.120 --> 38:38.240
And how did he sound?

38:38.240 --> 38:40.280
Like Isaac Turner.

38:41.400 --> 38:43.160
So, nothing unusual?  No.

38:43.160 --> 38:46.120
We sent him the link and
he jumped straight on this test.

38:46.120 --> 38:48.640
He did get a bit Christian Bale
at one point.

38:48.640 --> 38:51.360
Any chance you could raise
your laptop an inch for me, Isaac?

38:51.360 --> 38:53.520
No, I'm pretty happy with the frame.

38:53.520 --> 38:56.080
Yeah, well,
we'd prefer a bit more headroom.

38:56.080 --> 38:57.680
Or we can cancel the interview.

38:57.680 --> 38:59.800
He chose the framing.

38:59.800 --> 39:01.880
Yeah. Diva.

39:01.880 --> 39:03.280
Smart.

39:03.280 --> 39:06.520
So, what can you tell us,
off the record?

39:06.520 --> 39:08.680
Did China hack my programme,
or what?

39:08.680 --> 39:11.640
You can ask all you like, Ed,
you won't get any answers.

39:11.640 --> 39:14.080
Khadija. Er...this is...  Rachel.

39:14.080 --> 39:15.800
Hmm.

39:15.800 --> 39:18.360
Anthony told me
you'd be sniffing around.

39:18.360 --> 39:21.720
Well, I'd appreciate a few minutes,
Miss Khan, when you can spare them.

39:21.720 --> 39:24.760
You should've thought of that
before you took my story away.

39:26.240 --> 39:28.040
We're working on a better one.

39:28.040 --> 39:29.480
Yeah, we'll see.

39:31.160 --> 39:33.880
She'll warm up, possibly.

39:33.880 --> 39:37.280
You're running it, then,
the love child story?

39:37.280 --> 39:38.920
Yeah. We need to verify it first.

39:43.120 --> 39:44.520
Excuse me.

39:46.320 --> 39:49.240

from the hospital.

39:49.240 --> 39:50.760
I'm heading over there.

DISTANT SIRENS

40:17.800 --> 40:20.360
I asked you yesterday,
was there anything I should know.

40:22.040 --> 40:24.160
There was nothing then,
there's nothing now.

40:24.160 --> 40:26.560
The BBC are asking for a comment.
Tell them it's bullshit,

40:26.560 --> 40:28.720
and if they run it, we'll take
a pickaxe to their budget.

40:28.720 --> 40:30.640
Well, before we go that route,
Isaac,

40:30.640 --> 40:32.680
there is something
we need to ask you.

40:32.680 --> 40:34.000
Is it?

40:35.160 --> 40:36.880
Bullshit?

40:38.000 --> 40:39.680
It's a perfectly plausible story.

40:39.680 --> 40:41.200
You were in Lagos four years ago.

40:41.200 --> 40:43.080
Somebody's obviously done
their homework.

40:43.080 --> 40:44.800
So have you, by the looks of it.

40:44.800 --> 40:46.960
You manage to uncover
WHY I was there?

40:48.280 --> 40:51.240
No? I flew to Lagos
for my mother's funeral.

40:51.240 --> 40:54.320
Good! Um...not good.
I'm sorry for your loss.

40:54.320 --> 40:55.680
It was four years ago, Rowan.

40:55.680 --> 40:57.760
Would you be willing to take
a paternity test?

40:57.760 --> 41:00.680
For God's sake, the man's just
told you he was burying his mother!

41:00.680 --> 41:02.680
An emotional time.
What does that mean?

41:02.680 --> 41:05.480
It means it's not impossible that
while you flew to Lagos

41:05.480 --> 41:08.520
to bury your mother, you did also at
some point during that trip

41:08.520 --> 41:09.920
bury something else.

41:13.080 --> 41:15.160
Four years ago,
we'd just won the election.

41:15.160 --> 41:17.880
Do you really think I'd jeopardise
my seat in Parliament

41:17.880 --> 41:21.320
when I'd only just taken it?  We all
fuck up.  That's where you're wrong.

41:21.320 --> 41:22.640
You don't fuck up?  No.

41:22.640 --> 41:24.400
MCKENZIE LAUGHS

41:24.400 --> 41:27.320
So I'll just tell the press
that it can't be true,

41:27.320 --> 41:31.080
because the amazing Isaac Turner
never fucks up!

41:31.080 --> 41:32.560
Let me ask you something.

41:33.840 --> 41:36.560
How many Cabinet ministers
get caught with their pants down

41:36.560 --> 41:38.440
or their fingers in the expenses pot

41:38.440 --> 41:41.160
only to bounce right back,
careers unscathed?

41:42.160 --> 41:45.440
You see, it doesn't quite work
like that if you look like me.

41:46.640 --> 41:49.440
If I'M dishonest or promiscuous,

41:49.440 --> 41:51.960
I'm just confirming
everybody's worst suspicions.

41:53.040 --> 41:55.520
So there's a reason my parents
told me to work twice as hard

41:55.520 --> 41:58.280
and act twice as nice
as all the other kids in school.

41:58.280 --> 42:00.920
I took their advice,
I'm still taking it now.

42:00.920 --> 42:03.280
I treat my wife and children
with respect,

42:03.280 --> 42:05.840
but I don't do it just for
their sake or because it makes me

42:05.840 --> 42:08.160
a good Christian,
despite what everybody thinks.

42:08.160 --> 42:10.760
I do it because no-one's going
to give me a second chance!

42:11.840 --> 42:14.120
So, no, when it comes to
getting ahead in Westminster,

42:14.120 --> 42:15.800
I don't fuck up.

42:22.720 --> 42:25.040
I'll tell the BBC to bury the story.

42:25.040 --> 42:26.680
Thank fuck for that.

42:28.840 --> 42:31.600
Home Secretary,
I'd like a word, alone.

42:58.720 --> 43:02.040
but he will wake in due course.

43:08.880 --> 43:11.360
OK.  Shall we go and see him?  Yeah.

43:18.720 --> 43:21.720
Doctor? How long do you think
before he's conscious?

43:21.720 --> 43:24.360
Well, each patient is different,
but, er...

43:24.360 --> 43:27.360
well, he could be awake in
the next couple of hours.  Thank you.

45:42.320 --> 45:44.600
You're going to have to forgive me,
Home Secretary,

45:44.600 --> 45:48.360
but I've never had to navigate
around Correction before.

45:48.360 --> 45:49.760
I've no idea how it works.

45:49.760 --> 45:55.560
But I was expecting to see
a statement from you or the PM.

45:55.560 --> 45:58.040
Some reaction to my
highly-surprising announcement.

45:58.040 --> 45:59.320
There's been nothing.

45:59.320 --> 46:02.000
Well, it's sensitive whilst
the investigation's ongoing.

46:02.000 --> 46:05.360
Oh, what, so, we're just supposed
to let the disinformation fester?

46:05.360 --> 46:07.240
As long as we keep quiet,

46:07.240 --> 46:10.160
everyone's going to assume
we're going with Xanda.

46:10.160 --> 46:11.800
Beijing gets what it wants.

46:11.800 --> 46:16.560
You know, you COULD overrule
my recommendation.

46:17.520 --> 46:19.040
At least issue a statement,

46:19.040 --> 46:21.480
say you're undecided
and introduce doubt.

46:21.480 --> 46:23.720
Well, those options
are already being discussed.

46:24.960 --> 46:26.960
With who?  The PM, of course.

46:30.080 --> 46:31.440
You called a Cobra meeting?

46:31.440 --> 46:34.560
We met in the park for an ice cream.
What difference does it make?

46:34.560 --> 46:36.440
I'm talking to the PM.

46:36.440 --> 46:39.360
Look, Rowan, given how central I am
to this crisis,

46:39.360 --> 46:41.960
I strongly feel I should be
fully, actively involved

46:41.960 --> 46:43.560
in the Government's response.

46:43.560 --> 46:46.280
I think you deserve
a bloody good rest, mate.

46:48.440 --> 46:50.040
I don't NEED a rest.

46:50.040 --> 46:51.680
The UK is under attack.

46:51.680 --> 46:54.800
Not only am I Security Minister,
I'm one of the targets!

46:54.800 --> 46:59.200
And that's all the more reason for
you to maintain a healthy distance.

47:01.200 --> 47:03.720
Go home, Isaac.

47:03.720 --> 47:05.760

He's booked himself on Newsnight.

What did he say?

48:32.840 --> 48:34.600
He's promised them a bombshell.

48:36.560 --> 48:38.400
He's going to expose Correction.

52:11.720 --> 52:13.520
as Isaac Turner can tell you.

52:14.640 --> 52:17.560
Good evening, Khadija.  You contacted
us before we went on air

52:17.560 --> 52:20.320
with what you said
would be a revelatory statement.

52:20.320 --> 52:23.000
Yes. Apologies, Khadija,
for the cloak and dagger.

52:23.000 --> 52:24.400
I just wanted to make sure

52:24.400 --> 52:26.720
I had a clear channel
for what I'm about to say.

52:26.720 --> 52:31.360
Regarding yesterday's announcement,
I'd like to make a correction.

52:32.680 --> 52:35.920
The fact is, I do NOT support
Xanda's bid

52:35.920 --> 52:38.200
to supply facial rec
at Britain's borders.

52:38.200 --> 52:40.000
You've changed your mind again?

52:40.000 --> 52:43.000
Er...I-I do not support their bid,
and I strongly recommend

52:43.000 --> 52:45.200
the Government considers options
outside of China.

52:45.200 --> 52:48.120
Yesterday, you said there was
nothing to fear from...  Oh, my God!

52:48.120 --> 52:50.280

..the use of Chinese technology

52:50.280 --> 52:52.920

I-I-I didn't come here to dwell on

52:52.920 --> 52:54.080
what I did or didn't say.

52:54.080 --> 52:57.200
That was a direct quote.  Well,
nonetheless, the issue of borders...

52:57.200 --> 53:00.400
..Facial profiling is what makes us
the most effective security system.

53:00.400 --> 53:02.200
Oh, my God!  No, no, no!

53:02.200 --> 53:04.520
You've got to be fucking joking.
..But if, say,

53:04.520 --> 53:06.720
Muslim men between the ages
of 17 and 35...

53:06.720 --> 53:09.600
were the most-likely demographic
to launch an attack on an airport...

53:09.600 --> 53:11.200
PHONES DING

53:09.600 --> 53:11.200
..what's wrong with

53:11.200 --> 53:13.720
a system that...? I'd rather face
the consequences

53:13.720 --> 53:15.240
of appearing to change course

53:15.240 --> 53:17.760
than face the prospect of Xanda's
facial rec at our borders.

53:17.760 --> 53:20.160
Giving a firm with links
to the Chinese Communist Party

53:20.160 --> 53:23.000
access to our surveillance networks
would constitute...

53:23.000 --> 53:26.720
..Profiling, Xanda treats it
as a selling point.

53:26.720 --> 53:28.560
A selling point?

53:28.560 --> 53:31.680
..Changed your mind?
I've always been concerned about
undue influence of...

53:31.680 --> 53:33.640
Did the Prime Minister not back
your report?

53:33.640 --> 53:35.160
Putting together the CRC...

53:35.160 --> 53:37.640
..Like any company
with an international cloud,

53:37.640 --> 53:41.120
Xanda is in sync with
the growing number of governments

53:41.120 --> 53:43.880
around the globe who have no quarrel
with the idea...

53:43.880 --> 53:46.040
I've reached my decision
to recommend to the Cabinet

53:46.040 --> 53:47.760
that the facial-recognition contract

53:47.760 --> 53:50.080
is awarded to a technology company
whose...

53:50.080 --> 53:52.240
Stop this broadcast! Cut it!

53:52.240 --> 53:55.360
Ed, you need to terminate
this broadcast!  What? No! Fuck off!

53:55.360 --> 53:58.520
The fact that Xanda's maths adds up
ought to be a source of comfort.

53:58.520 --> 54:00.640
I'm sure the majority
of your viewers would agree.

54:00.640 --> 54:03.040
Fucking hell!  Hello?
This is a national security issue!

54:03.040 --> 54:04.800
Somebody needs to stop
this broadcast!

54:04.800 --> 54:07.760
Can someone get this woman
out of my fucking gallery?

54:07.760 --> 54:12.040
I'm trying.  National security.
Somebody stop broadcast now!

54:12.040 --> 54:13.760
..Give me an answer!  It won't cut!

54:13.760 --> 54:16.160
It's not cutting!  We're locked
on Turner!  What's going on?

54:16.160 --> 54:18.920
Racial profiling is what makes
Muslim men between the ages of...

54:18.920 --> 54:20.960
Xanda is in synch with
the growing number of...

54:20.960 --> 54:23.000
Wrap it up, Khadija.  Cut it back!

54:23.000 --> 54:26.080
Khadija, wrap it up now.
Minister, we have to move on.

54:26.080 --> 54:28.720
Now, listening to that
in our Salford studio was...

54:28.720 --> 54:30.240
What the fuck...?!

54:32.520 --> 54:33.880
PHONE RINGS

54:35.280 --> 54:36.920
Oh.

54:38.800 --> 54:40.720
Prime Minister.

54:40.720 --> 54:43.160
Ed?  Twitter's blown up.

54:43.160 --> 54:45.800
What?! Over the U-turn?
That's ludicrous!

54:45.800 --> 54:47.840
Ma'am, you need to get down here.

54:47.840 --> 54:50.680
Why has my wife called seven times?
Everybody, quiet!

54:51.960 --> 54:53.640
This is a police matter!

54:53.640 --> 54:56.400
Nobody is to leave this studio
until otherwise instructed.

54:56.400 --> 54:59.520
I need you...and you.

55:01.480 --> 55:03.600
You contacted us
before we went on air

55:03.600 --> 55:06.520
with what you said would be
a revelatory statement.

55:06.520 --> 55:09.040
What's wrong with this?!
Keep watching.

55:09.040 --> 55:13.000
Regarding yesterday's announcement,
I'd like to make a correction.

55:13.000 --> 55:16.200
You asked me if Xanda
had been tested for racial bias.

55:16.200 --> 55:18.640
I'm afraid my answer
wasn't entirely accurate.

55:18.640 --> 55:20.560
What IS this? He didn't say that.

55:20.560 --> 55:22.680
The truth is,

55:22.680 --> 55:25.640
racial profiling is what makes Xanda

55:25.640 --> 55:28.280
the most-effective security system
on the market.

55:28.280 --> 55:31.640
What?!  We've been hacked.
This has been changed! Faked!

55:31.640 --> 55:32.880
Corrected.

55:32.880 --> 55:35.040
If, and I'm not saying
this is the case,

55:35.040 --> 55:38.800
but if, say, Muslim men
between the ages of 17 and 35

55:38.800 --> 55:41.600
were the most-likely demographic
to launch an attack at an airport,

55:41.600 --> 55:44.520
what's wrong with a system
that factors that in?

55:44.520 --> 55:47.120
I-I-I-I-I would...I would nev...

55:47.120 --> 55:49.200
H-How...?  I don't know.

55:49.200 --> 55:52.040
Minister, are you suggesting

55:52.040 --> 55:54.960
the programme uses racial bias
deliberately...?

55:54.960 --> 55:58.480
That's my voice!
I'm not suggesting, I'm saying.

55:59.560 --> 56:01.960
While most
facial-recognition providers

56:01.960 --> 56:03.360
see profiling as an AI flaw,

56:03.360 --> 56:05.760
Xanda treats it as a selling point.

56:05.760 --> 56:07.960
A selling point?  Yes.

56:07.960 --> 56:09.920
Like any company...

56:09.920 --> 56:12.720
If you think you can slap a D-notice
on this, you can think again.

56:12.720 --> 56:14.800
I must ask you to sit down.
Good luck with that!

56:14.800 --> 56:17.560
You are a witness to a major
national security breach.  No shit!

56:17.560 --> 56:20.280
First time...  Everyone here is a
suspect...  ..people are going...

56:20.280 --> 56:22.480
Do not make me explain...
Furthermore, I must...

56:22.480 --> 56:24.960
..Choosing to interact
with other suspects at this time

56:24.960 --> 56:27.040
may compromise
a counter-terror investigation!

56:27.040 --> 56:29.760
Sorry, I'm going way above anyone
in here.  Khadija!

56:32.160 --> 56:33.920
Maybe we should let her
get on with it.

56:33.920 --> 56:35.560
I told you, it is not that simple!

56:35.560 --> 56:37.640
And I asked you if you had a plan!

56:40.800 --> 56:42.280
Wait here.

56:43.920 --> 56:46.720
Minister...  I can tell you that...
..to be completely clear,

56:46.720 --> 56:51.360
you're advocating the use of
racial profiling at UK airports?

56:51.360 --> 56:53.480
No, Khadija, to be completely clear,

56:53.480 --> 56:56.880
I'm advocating the use of racial
profiling wherever it keeps us safe.

56:56.880 --> 56:59.560
Minister, we have to move on.
I'm fucking finished.

57:03.680 --> 57:04.920
Khadija?

57:09.400 --> 57:12.480
Khadija!  You are not taking
this story away from me.

57:12.480 --> 57:15.520
I'm calling the channel controller
and then I'm calling legal.

57:15.520 --> 57:17.000
CALL FAILS

57:17.000 --> 57:18.600
Fucking signal!

57:19.600 --> 57:21.480
And how are you going to prove it?

57:21.480 --> 57:24.360
I just saw myself hacked
and deep-faked with my own eyes!

57:24.360 --> 57:27.080
And everybody else saw an interview,
just like every other night.

57:27.080 --> 57:29.120
It will be your word
against everybody else's.

57:29.120 --> 57:31.160
Not even your own crew
saw what happened!

57:33.080 --> 57:34.600
RINGING TONE

57:36.480 --> 57:38.680
You have no idea
what you're up against.

57:42.280 --> 57:46.160
If you're serious about
investigating it and exposing it...

57:46.160 --> 57:47.680
MAN ON PHONE:  Hello?

57:47.680 --> 57:49.960
..you need to gather evidence
meticulously.

57:49.960 --> 57:52.000
A wealth of it.

57:52.000 --> 57:55.360
You need to prove it definitively

57:55.360 --> 57:57.720
so no-one can deny it.

57:57.720 --> 57:59.440
Hello?

58:01.400 --> 58:02.840
Who is it?

58:04.240 --> 58:05.920
And how do you suggest doing that?

58:10.080 --> 58:11.520
Together.
