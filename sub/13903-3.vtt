WEBVTT

00:00.633 --> 00:03.073
Saturday afternoon at the movies.

00:04.753 --> 00:07.953
A real girlfriend...going on a real
date.

00:09.553 --> 00:11.833
I'm just not sure if that's me.

00:48.673 --> 00:52.073
You see, this is why I don't do
relationships.

00:52.073 --> 00:57.313
Dates. I don't understand the rules.
Who's in charge? Who pays?

00:57.313 --> 00:59.353
Lucky. Last two tickets.

00:59.353 --> 01:01.433
So what are we going to see again?

01:01.433 --> 01:05.753
It's a French Canadian documentary
about Alzheimer's. It's hilarious.

01:07.153 --> 01:09.193
Really?
No! No, it's a comedy.

01:09.193 --> 01:12.673
Time Out calls it "the perfect date
movie", so no pressure.

01:12.673 --> 01:16.393
I've never seen a movie without Will
Ferrell or a talking dog before.

01:16.393 --> 01:18.433
Oh, I'm touched.
You should be.

01:18.433 --> 01:21.233
Can I pay you for the tickets?
No, of course not.

01:21.233 --> 01:23.233
Can I go halves?
No, put it away.

01:23.233 --> 01:25.153
(COINS FALL)
Oh, shit!

01:26.273 --> 01:29.753
(BUZZER)
My 12:30. Tony.

01:29.753 --> 01:32.113
He also wants a girlfriend.

01:32.113 --> 01:34.193
The GFE.

01:34.193 --> 01:38.713
The Girlfriend Experience.
90 minutes. Â£400 worth of chat.

01:38.713 --> 01:40.793
And cuddles.

01:40.793 --> 01:44.513
I know it doesn't make sense but
somehow this is easier.

01:44.513 --> 01:47.793
This is the kind of girlfriend
I can be.

01:49.433 --> 01:53.073
Christ, sorry I'm late.
Total mare at the office.

01:53.073 --> 01:55.873
I know. Should have seen the FTSE 100
this morning.

01:55.873 --> 01:58.793
Up, down, buy, sell.

01:58.793 --> 02:00.873
Take the piss all you want.

02:00.873 --> 02:02.913
You know you still love us city
boys.

02:02.913 --> 02:06.793
Yeah, it's strange, isn't it? Must be
that sense of self-importance.

02:06.793 --> 02:08.752
(LAUGHS) Cheeky bint!

02:11.313 --> 02:13.273
You didn't tell me you got
a pay rise.

02:13.273 --> 02:16.313
Yeah, a guy in Mergers put me on to
his tailor. It's lovely.

02:16.313 --> 02:18.393
Thank you. He's a brilliant bloke.

02:18.393 --> 02:20.673
Trained Savile Row, works out of
Camden.

02:20.673 --> 02:22.513
Not cheap, though.

02:22.513 --> 02:25.913
Well, the best things never are.
(LAUGHS)

02:32.753 --> 02:36.873
Men like Tony...they don't have time
for a real relationship.

02:36.873 --> 02:40.753
With their six-figure salaries and
their 70-hour working weeks.

02:40.753 --> 02:44.913
They don't want to come home to PMT,
a dressing gown and a gluten
intolerance.

02:46.273 --> 02:48.313
Me...

02:48.313 --> 02:50.273
I'll eat anything.

02:50.953 --> 02:52.913
(PANTING)

02:53.393 --> 02:55.433
# My name is Blossom

02:55.433 --> 02:58.633
# I was raised in a lion's den

03:01.273 --> 03:03.673
# My nightly occupation

03:03.673 --> 03:06.193
# Stealing other women's men

03:06.193 --> 03:08.833
OK... OK, go.

03:08.833 --> 03:11.233
# I'm an evil, evil woman

03:11.233 --> 03:14.953
# But I want to do a man some good

03:16.233 --> 03:17.993
(MOANS HEAVILY)

03:17.993 --> 03:20.033
# I'm an evil, evil woman

03:20.033 --> 03:22.913
# And I want to do a man some good

03:25.073 --> 03:27.673
# I'm Gina Lollobrigida

03:27.673 --> 03:29.953
# I ain't Red Riding Hood #

03:31.793 --> 03:33.753
(BUZZER)

03:38.873 --> 03:41.313
Hello?
I want to talk to you.

03:41.313 --> 03:43.393
I'm sorry but who is this?

03:43.393 --> 03:46.673
Let me in or I will scream and I
will tell every single person

03:46.673 --> 03:49.313
in this building that you're fucking
my husband.

03:51.073 --> 03:53.073
I'm sorry, I have no idea who you
are.

03:53.073 --> 03:55.793
I'm his wife. I'm Matt's wife.

03:55.793 --> 03:58.153
Matt?
My husband.

03:58.153 --> 04:00.873
The man you're sleeping with.
I'm really sorry -

04:00.873 --> 04:04.473
I followed him. I saw him press
your number. He was here.

04:04.473 --> 04:07.753
I don't know who you're talking
about. He just left five minutes ago.

04:07.753 --> 04:09.713
Don't lie to me.

04:11.153 --> 04:13.393
Tony.
Tony?

04:14.753 --> 04:16.713
Is that what he calls himself?

04:17.952 --> 04:21.072
He's Matt. Matt Hexton and he's
married.

04:21.072 --> 04:22.993
Did he tell you that?

04:22.993 --> 04:25.193
No. No, I don't suppose he told you
much.

04:25.193 --> 04:26.793
Too busy shagging.

04:26.793 --> 04:29.513
-Please...-What? They know what you
do, don't they?

04:29.513 --> 04:31.793
They know you wreck people's
marriages.

04:31.793 --> 04:33.873
No, I'm not going anywhere!

04:33.873 --> 04:36.633
Tell me, how long have you been
having an affair?

04:36.633 --> 04:39.393
We're not having an affair.
He was here for over an hour.

04:39.393 --> 04:42.033
I was outside.
You have to go. I can't help you.

04:42.033 --> 04:45.433
I was timing you. What were you
doing if you weren't having sex?

04:46.713 --> 04:49.433
Any problem you have with your
husband -

04:49.433 --> 04:51.993
Yes, you said it, he's MY husband.
Yes, I know.

04:51.993 --> 04:53.953
Then what are you doing with him?

04:57.913 --> 04:59.873
We have an arrangement.

05:01.073 --> 05:03.313
What? What are you talking about?

05:03.313 --> 05:05.393
I'm not in love with your husband.

05:05.393 --> 05:07.513
I have no feelings for him
whatsoever.

05:07.513 --> 05:09.553
He...

05:09.553 --> 05:11.513
He pays me...

05:12.553 --> 05:14.513
..for my services.

05:18.673 --> 05:20.913
Oh, God... Oh, God...
Come through here.

05:25.033 --> 05:26.993
(VOMITS)

05:30.793 --> 05:33.233
It's nice to know I have this effect
on people.

05:50.153 --> 05:52.113
(SMASH OF GLASS)

05:53.273 --> 05:56.153
Hello? Excuse me, is everything all
right in there?

05:56.153 --> 05:58.113
(MOBILE PHONE RINGS)

06:02.313 --> 06:04.833
'Hello?'
Hey, it's Alex.

06:04.833 --> 06:06.913
I've got a quick question for you.

06:06.913 --> 06:09.633
When I'm old and prolapsed
and I can't get to the pub

06:09.633 --> 06:11.553
without help, will you kill me?

06:11.553 --> 06:14.793
I don't know. 'Come on,
I need to know you'd do it.

06:14.793 --> 06:17.193
Bag over the head, pills in the
Ovaltine?'

06:17.193 --> 06:19.353
If there's to be any future for us.

06:19.353 --> 06:21.233
Well, we'll just have...

06:22.473 --> 06:24.993
I hurt my hand.
Er, thanks for calling.

06:26.193 --> 06:28.153
Hello?

06:33.113 --> 06:35.073
I'm sure there's some up here.

06:40.033 --> 06:42.993
Oh, erm...do you want a cup of tea,
or...?

06:42.993 --> 06:46.793
A biscuit? You might need something
sweet, you know...blood sugar...

06:46.793 --> 06:48.753
Why would he pay for it?

06:50.993 --> 06:53.033
Is it something weird?
Sorry?

06:53.033 --> 06:57.633
Why he comes to you -
is it something...kinky.

06:57.633 --> 06:59.633
Does he like to dress up?
Is that it?

06:59.633 --> 07:02.113
Is he a transvestite?

07:02.113 --> 07:04.953
Why would you think that?
His dad's a vicar.

07:08.593 --> 07:10.673
It's nothing like that.

07:10.673 --> 07:15.073
Why couldn't he just get a
girlfriend or shag his secretary?

07:16.233 --> 07:18.953
He couldn't even manage that. Easier
for him just to...

07:18.953 --> 07:20.993
pull out his credit card.

07:20.993 --> 07:25.193
What happens here is...it's just sex.

07:25.193 --> 07:27.073
It's nothing...

07:28.153 --> 07:31.113
What you have, a marriage,
it's much more -

07:31.113 --> 07:33.753
Christ! What the hell would
you know?

07:33.753 --> 07:36.073
To prostitutes even have
relationships?

07:36.073 --> 07:38.033
Do they? Have you got a boyfriend?

07:45.153 --> 07:47.113
He always was a selfish bastard.

07:48.313 --> 07:51.033
That's why we waited so long before
having kids.

07:51.033 --> 07:55.513
He wasn't prepared to give up his
bachelor bloody lifestyle.

07:55.513 --> 07:57.553
You've got children?

07:57.553 --> 07:59.633
Twins. Six months.

07:59.633 --> 08:01.953
Hardly surprising
we don't have much sex.

08:03.513 --> 08:07.393
He's always working and I'm sat on
the sofa breast-feeding

08:07.393 --> 08:09.593
like some old sow.

08:13.633 --> 08:15.593
I used to have great tits.

08:18.073 --> 08:20.313
Sometimes when I'm at home,

08:20.313 --> 08:24.193
I do those survey things
where you tick a box

08:24.193 --> 08:26.673
to see how strong
your relationship is.

08:28.313 --> 08:30.273
I know they're ridiculous.

08:30.273 --> 08:33.193
I know they're just some stupid
thing in a magazine,

08:33.193 --> 08:38.232
but I always...always get a really
high score.

08:39.673 --> 08:41.633
We do...

08:45.313 --> 08:48.393
You think that sounds pathetic,
don't you? No, I don't.

08:48.393 --> 08:50.353
I do.

08:52.753 --> 08:55.513
I'm going to clean your bathroom.
There's glass.

08:55.513 --> 08:57.873
No, don't worry, it's fine.
No, I want to.

08:57.873 --> 09:00.073
No, no, no, really, it's not
necessary.

09:00.073 --> 09:02.033
Look, please, I made the mess.

09:06.193 --> 09:08.233
You must see everything here.

09:08.233 --> 09:10.273
Men...

09:10.273 --> 09:12.233
what they really want.

09:15.393 --> 09:17.353
What DO they want?

09:21.393 --> 09:23.473
Well...

09:23.473 --> 09:29.113
One gentleman likes to dress up as a
tennis player

09:29.113 --> 09:33.633
while I play with his...new balls.

09:36.953 --> 09:39.553
(GIGGLES) Men...

09:44.993 --> 09:48.513
What's this?
Oh, you don't need to touch that.

09:48.513 --> 09:50.513
Erm...it's a plug.
(BUZZES)

09:50.513 --> 09:52.473
Oh, it vibrates!

09:53.673 --> 09:55.633
It's a butt plug.

09:58.433 --> 10:00.393
Oh! (VOMITS)

10:17.314 --> 10:22.154
Is it just me or some days does it
feel like...everyone wants you?

10:23.354 --> 10:25.314
This is for you.

10:26.594 --> 10:28.674
It's Balenciaga, to say thank you.

10:28.674 --> 10:30.954
What for?
Everything.

10:30.954 --> 10:34.674
Honestly, just walking down the
street on the way here,

10:34.674 --> 10:38.274
I could feel the eyes on me.
I mean, I know I'm hot, but...

10:38.274 --> 10:40.994
You're working, aren't you?
How did you guess?

10:40.994 --> 10:43.954
It's just what happens.
When you're an escort, men...

10:43.954 --> 10:47.314
Well, some men,
they can just sense it.

10:47.314 --> 10:50.274
I don't know. Well, I'm doing it
properly this time.

10:50.274 --> 10:54.434
I've seen Stephanie
and she's taken me on.
Proper clients, proper security.

10:54.434 --> 10:57.074
(MOBILE PHONE RINGS)
Oh, sorry, babes, hang on.

10:58.994 --> 11:03.194
All right, sweetie? No, no, no,
course not. I'm just with a friend.

11:03.194 --> 11:06.314
No, not like that. (GIGGLES)

11:06.314 --> 11:10.154
Listen, I've got to go, so you hold
that thought. Ciao!

11:11.474 --> 11:13.314
Oh, he sounds really sweet.

11:13.314 --> 11:16.034
He's a time-waster
and he'll never make a booking.

11:16.034 --> 11:19.834
Tell him your not a chat line, never
take his calls again. Seriously?

11:19.834 --> 11:24.474
Look, just...don't get carried away.

11:24.474 --> 11:27.794
All right? The money, the attention -
it's just a job.

11:28.954 --> 11:32.154
And in the end, people will take what
they can and judge you for it.

11:33.354 --> 11:36.034
Be careful -
that's what I'm trying to say.

11:36.034 --> 11:39.394
See? Where would I be without you?

11:42.834 --> 11:45.874
Shit, Han.
Yeah, shit indeed.

11:45.874 --> 11:47.914
So go on, what did she do then?

11:47.914 --> 11:50.954
Screeching, bit of casual vomiting,

11:50.954 --> 11:53.594
just to show quite how disgusting
she found me.

11:53.594 --> 11:57.034
You know, I always thought something
like this might happen.

11:57.034 --> 11:59.474
Why? All these guys have wives,
don't they?

11:59.474 --> 12:01.474
Not all of them, no.
Most of them.

12:01.474 --> 12:03.554
So how did you leave it?

12:03.554 --> 12:06.674
Well, obviously she left.
Are you going to keep in touch?

12:06.674 --> 12:09.554
Course (!) We thought we'd make it
a regular thing,

12:09.554 --> 12:11.714
seeing as we had so much in common.

12:13.074 --> 12:15.194
Shall we do one?

12:15.194 --> 12:17.634
What shall we do now? I don't want
to go home.

12:17.634 --> 12:21.034
What, in case wifey's still there,
behind the door?

12:21.034 --> 12:23.634
(LAUGHS) I'm so glad you find it
amusing.

12:23.634 --> 12:26.074
Come on, I haven't been out in ages.

12:26.074 --> 12:28.154
I can't. Not tonight.

12:28.154 --> 12:33.314
We could go to that Thai place with
the fat guy. He sings on Wednesdays.

12:33.314 --> 12:35.714
I can't, I'm on kitchen duty.
What?

12:35.714 --> 12:38.954
We take it in turns cooking for each
other, me and Vanessa.

12:38.954 --> 12:44.194
Tofu Stroganoff in St Albans.
The excitement must be unbearable!

12:44.194 --> 12:46.234
You'd be surprised.

12:46.234 --> 12:48.194
Yeah, I would.

12:49.314 --> 12:53.114
Come on. Just a quick one!
Come on, one drink.

12:53.114 --> 12:56.154
I can't. She's picking me up from
the station. Your loss.

13:01.074 --> 13:04.074
All right, I'll do it.
'Too late. I've changed my mind.'

13:04.074 --> 13:07.434
Euthanasia's very last week.
That's a shame (!)

13:07.434 --> 13:10.754
You'll get over it. I was thinking
about cryogenics.

13:10.754 --> 13:12.794
Got a big freezer?

13:12.794 --> 13:14.754
Bye.

13:16.434 --> 13:18.234
Nutter.

13:19.194 --> 13:20.914
What have you done?

13:23.434 --> 13:26.194
She was here. She saw you come in.

13:26.194 --> 13:28.154
I didn't have a choice.

13:29.554 --> 13:31.634
Well, that's it, then, isn't it?

13:31.634 --> 13:36.354
That's it, it's over. It's fucking
over. Eight years of marriage.

13:36.354 --> 13:38.394
Erm...

13:38.394 --> 13:40.874
I'm really sorry, Tony.

13:40.874 --> 13:43.514
It's Matt. My name is Matt.

13:43.514 --> 13:45.594
Well, it's erm...

13:45.594 --> 13:49.274
It's really got nothing to do with
me. You need to talk to your wife.

13:49.274 --> 13:51.354
Talk to her?

13:51.354 --> 13:53.674
She won't even make eye contact
with me.

13:53.674 --> 13:55.874
She won't even let me hold
the twins.

13:55.874 --> 13:58.354
How can I even begin to fix this

13:58.354 --> 14:00.314
if she won't even look at me?

14:03.394 --> 14:05.474
Hold me, please.

14:07.394 --> 14:09.994
Matt...
I can't lose you as well.

14:11.794 --> 14:13.794
If you want to be here, then...

14:13.794 --> 14:17.154
What?
..with me, you...

14:18.674 --> 14:21.234
Oh, God, yes.

14:21.234 --> 14:23.194
Of course, I'm sorry. Sorry, erm...

14:26.594 --> 14:30.074
A client/escort relationship should
have clear boundaries.

14:30.074 --> 14:34.954
Anything else just...doesn't work.

14:37.074 --> 14:39.114
Oh, yeah.

14:39.114 --> 14:42.554
(SIGHS) Yeah...yeah...

14:42.554 --> 14:45.474
God, doesn't that give you jaw ache?

14:45.474 --> 14:47.434
Cooey!

14:49.714 --> 14:53.034
What? What's going on? Why have you
stopped? Nothing. Sorry.

14:59.914 --> 15:02.594
Oh, so that's what he likes!
What's the matter?

15:04.114 --> 15:06.074
Nothing.

15:07.754 --> 15:09.794
I can't do this with you here.

15:09.794 --> 15:11.914
Oh, Christ.

15:11.914 --> 15:16.994
Oh, dear. I thought you were
supposed to be a professional.

15:18.234 --> 15:21.554
Right, er... Let's try something
else, shall we?

15:27.674 --> 15:29.634
Ahem...

15:30.754 --> 15:33.074
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, don't stop.

15:33.074 --> 15:35.034
Please don't stop.

15:42.194 --> 15:44.154
No, sorry, I can't do this any more.

15:45.714 --> 15:47.794
What? What's happened?

15:47.794 --> 15:50.034
Sorry, I'll refund your money.
Money?

15:50.034 --> 15:52.474
I don't want the bloody money.
What's going on?

15:52.474 --> 15:55.514
This has nothing to do with me.
You need to speak to your wife.

15:55.514 --> 15:58.954
You can't just pretend this isn't
happening! The tart with the heart!

15:58.954 --> 16:03.074
Talk to your wife, sort your marriage
out. I can't see you any more. What?!

16:03.074 --> 16:05.874
You're breaking up with me?
We were never together!

16:17.994 --> 16:19.954
Relationships.

16:23.554 --> 16:25.594
How do people do them?

16:25.594 --> 16:27.554
I've no idea.

16:31.234 --> 16:33.234
# The blank pages of my diary

16:33.234 --> 16:35.794
This is why I shouldn't go anywhere
near them.

16:35.794 --> 16:39.474
# That I haven't touched
since you left me

16:39.474 --> 16:41.514
This is why I shouldn't even drive.

16:41.514 --> 16:47.154
# The closed blinds in my home

16:47.154 --> 16:51.554
# See no light of day

16:52.954 --> 16:57.554
# Dust gathers on my stereo

16:57.554 --> 16:59.594
# Cos I can't bear...

16:59.594 --> 17:01.554
Hi, Alex, it's me.

17:02.754 --> 17:04.794
Erm...

17:04.794 --> 17:06.954
Can I come over for an hour?

17:09.594 --> 17:11.634
OK.

17:11.634 --> 17:13.594
All right, bye.

17:16.074 --> 17:21.634
# I'm scared to face another day

17:21.634 --> 17:23.874
# Cos the fear in me...

17:23.874 --> 17:28.594
Here you are.
Your times starts...now. Coffee?

17:34.034 --> 17:36.834
I'm just not ready to be
a girlfriend.

17:36.834 --> 17:38.794
Shit, no milk. Sorry.

17:40.154 --> 17:42.794
Anybody's girlfriend.
Or, indeed, any coffee.

17:45.474 --> 17:47.434
I'm a mess.

17:48.274 --> 17:51.034
Alex, are you actually listening to
anything I'm saying?

17:51.034 --> 17:54.154
Of course. You're telling me in an
oh so delightful way

17:54.154 --> 17:56.834
that you want to break up with me.
The thing is...

17:56.834 --> 17:58.794
you're not a mess. You're gorgeous.

18:00.354 --> 18:03.394
I ju... I just don't think it's fair
on you

18:03.394 --> 18:05.434
to start something and...

18:05.434 --> 18:07.514
You walk out on me in my hotel room,

18:07.514 --> 18:10.674
you run out on me at dinner,
you constantly hang up on me.

18:10.674 --> 18:12.914
That sounds like a relationship
to me.

18:12.914 --> 18:16.554
Let's just stop. Let's just be
friends. I don't want to be friends.

18:16.554 --> 18:19.674
I wanna do things to you that I don't
wanna do to my friends.

18:23.474 --> 18:25.554
Alex, I can't go out with you.

18:25.554 --> 18:27.674
Irish coffee? Except without the
coffee,

18:27.674 --> 18:30.194
which would be whiskey.
I'm not what you want.

18:30.194 --> 18:32.194
You're exactly what I want.
I'm not.

18:33.034 --> 18:35.874
It's really complicated.
I love complicated.

18:35.874 --> 18:38.554
Cos it's interesting, it's exciting.

18:38.554 --> 18:43.474
It's just...I'm not very good...
erm...at just opening up.

18:43.474 --> 18:45.514
Or sharing...

18:45.514 --> 18:47.874
I'm a very private person.

18:47.874 --> 18:51.114
I'm not asking you to tell me things,
to divulge your innermost.

18:53.754 --> 18:57.754
I mean, Jesus, who really knows
everything about anyone?

18:58.754 --> 19:00.754
Why would you really want to?

19:02.074 --> 19:04.034
Do you really believe that?

19:05.594 --> 19:07.634
I do.

19:07.634 --> 19:09.594
Hannah...

19:10.634 --> 19:12.594
..we're just starting.

19:14.554 --> 19:16.514
Don't run scared already.

19:34.514 --> 19:36.554
No, don't.
Why?

19:36.554 --> 19:39.474
No, cos I'm trying to break up
with you.

19:39.474 --> 19:41.474
Tough, tough.

19:42.634 --> 19:44.594
Can't always get what you want.

20:13.554 --> 20:15.594
Shit, I'm going to be late.

20:15.594 --> 20:17.634
My boss is very punctual.

20:17.634 --> 20:19.714
An overrated quality.

20:19.714 --> 20:21.754
I've gotta go.
Oh!

20:24.914 --> 20:26.794
Oh, Hannah...
Yeah?

20:26.794 --> 20:28.914
I really enjoyed breaking up
with you.

20:28.914 --> 20:31.674
Can we do it again soon, please?
(GIGGLES)

20:40.234 --> 20:42.874
# Like a sound you hear
that lingers in your ear

20:42.874 --> 20:45.554
# But you can't forget
From sundown to sunset...

20:45.554 --> 20:48.914
My 9:30. He also wants the
girlfriend experience.

20:48.914 --> 20:52.834
He likes to lie in bed, watch movies
and hold my hand.

20:53.834 --> 20:55.674
It's nice.

20:58.354 --> 21:00.314
(PHONE RINGS)

21:05.754 --> 21:07.674
Hello?
Hey, it's me.

21:09.554 --> 21:11.394
What are you doing?

21:11.394 --> 21:14.874
Nothing much, just getting ready
for work.

21:14.874 --> 21:16.874
I hope that you're thinking about me.

21:16.874 --> 21:18.834
(GIGGLES)

21:21.314 --> 21:23.394
I met someone.
What do you mean?

21:23.394 --> 21:25.314
Hey!

21:25.314 --> 21:28.554
Is he better looking than me?
Is that actually possible?

21:28.554 --> 21:31.194
Come clean to him and I'll come and
have lunch with you.

21:31.194 --> 21:33.634
So, are you going to tell Alex the
truth or shall I?
