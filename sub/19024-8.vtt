00:01.359 --> 00:04.078
As a doctor, you spend
about a third of your nights

00:04.160 --> 00:06.435
sleeping at the hospital,
but in truth,

00:06.520 --> 00:08.715
not a lot of sleeping takes place.

00:08.800 --> 00:11.633
- Dr Reid.
- I'm not sucking my thumb.

00:11.720 --> 00:14.314
Mr Rodriguez is coding.

00:16.400 --> 00:19.437
- You look pretty.
- Thank you.

00:22.080 --> 00:24.389
You learn to appreciate
the little things,

00:24.480 --> 00:26.277
Iike waking up in your own bed.

00:26.360 --> 00:29.113
Of course, if there's someone
there with you...

00:29.200 --> 00:33.034
- Sorry I woke you.
- I'll live.

00:33.120 --> 00:35.076
... that's just gravy.

00:35.160 --> 00:37.993
Yep, there's nothing
like mornings at home.

00:38.080 --> 00:41.868
- Hey, there, sunshine.
- Morning.

00:41.960 --> 00:43.791
I forgot Carla
is staying with us

00:43.880 --> 00:46.474
while her building
is being fumigated.

00:46.560 --> 00:50.917
Hey, don't use Rowdy to cover up
your giblets. Apologize.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.753
T ell me why we have no milk
or orange juice,

00:53.840 --> 00:55.751
but, like, 40 fruit cups in here?

00:55.840 --> 00:58.354
The average resident
owes over $100,000

00:58.440 --> 01:01.352
in med school loans and makes
about as much as a waiter.

01:01.440 --> 01:03.795
So you have to do things
to make ends meet.

01:03.880 --> 01:06.235
Like you can cover
someone's shift.

01:09.800 --> 01:12.712
Or you can steal stuff
from the hospital.

01:12.800 --> 01:15.997
Or you can moonlight
at an urgent care centre.

01:18.480 --> 01:21.313
Or you can steal stuff.

01:27.360 --> 01:30.158
Or your dad
can pay for everyhing.

01:30.240 --> 01:32.071
Or... Well, you know.

01:32.160 --> 01:34.549
- Is it clear?
- Come on, come on.

01:34.640 --> 01:36.358
Go! Go! Run!

01:37.800 --> 01:39.631
- Hold up.
- Why?

01:39.720 --> 01:43.156
There's been several thefts.
We're doing bag checks.

01:43.240 --> 01:45.196
What about that guy
taking scrubs?

01:45.280 --> 01:46.679
Hey, Tom.

01:46.760 --> 01:48.876
He doesn't have a bag.

01:48.960 --> 01:51.190
Go ahead, narc. I'm clean.

01:51.280 --> 01:52.759
Yeah?

01:52.840 --> 01:56.549
Of course,
if he was checking my trunk...

01:58.600 --> 02:01.672
- Pudding. Score!
- Come on! Let's go, let's go!

02:07.640 --> 02:10.234
Get me a butterscotch, buddy.

02:10.320 --> 02:11.639
Come on!

02:13.000 --> 02:19.074

02:28.880 --> 02:31.474
I did that cardioversion,
I extubated Mrs Bays,

02:31.560 --> 02:33.755
and I finished
all the transfer summaries

02:33.840 --> 02:36.798
- on the nursing-home patients.
- Well, what can I say?

02:36.880 --> 02:40.236
You did exceptional work today,
Newbie, and I'm proud of you.

02:40.320 --> 02:42.356
Did he just wink at me?

02:42.440 --> 02:46.399
- Is there a problem?
- I'm just so happy.

02:49.160 --> 02:52.152
- No, no problem, sir.
- Attaboy.

02:52.240 --> 02:54.549
And, Laverne,

02:54.640 --> 02:58.872
what is that delightfully
naught-ay scent you're wearing?

02:58.960 --> 03:01.633
It's called Twelve-Hour Shift.

03:03.880 --> 03:06.440
- Yeah, it is.
- Why the hell is he so cheery?

03:06.520 --> 03:08.795
Because I did
exceptional work today.

03:08.880 --> 03:10.836
Hey, babe.

03:10.920 --> 03:14.674
I ordered the fight on pay-per-view,
got a six-pack of beer.

03:14.760 --> 03:18.548
- We are leaving this second.
- Hop on, Blondie. Come here.

03:18.640 --> 03:21.200
Oh, Perry gonna get
some loving

03:21.280 --> 03:24.272
Perry gonna get some loving
Oh, Perry gonna get some...

03:26.840 --> 03:29.638
Is there one bathroom
in this damn place

03:29.720 --> 03:31.950
that has toilet paper,
or do I have to start

03:32.040 --> 03:34.474
carrying around
a basket of leaves?

03:38.280 --> 03:41.033
This is the reason why
your headache didn't go away.

03:41.120 --> 03:45.398
That's actually pronounced
analgesic, not "anal"-gesic.

03:45.480 --> 03:47.869
Sir, the pills go in your mouth.

03:49.280 --> 03:51.669
We're going to be short
a doctor tomorrow,

03:51.760 --> 03:54.832
so if you've got a friend
that wants an extra 300 bucks...

03:54.920 --> 03:59.072
And they said they'll pay you
200 bucks. Cash money.

03:59.160 --> 04:02.516
Sweet! Dude, you are
like the best friend ever.

04:02.600 --> 04:05.398
Hell, yeah.

04:07.120 --> 04:09.111
My mother
lives with me all year.

04:09.200 --> 04:11.589
My Aunt has to take care of her
for one week

04:11.680 --> 04:13.511
and she won't stop bitching.

04:13.600 --> 04:16.512
My dad's coming in to town
for a conference tomorrow.

04:16.600 --> 04:19.750
- You don't seem stressed out.
- I haven't pooed in six days.

04:19.839 --> 04:23.037
Twice this morning,
and I haven't even had my coffee yet.

04:23.120 --> 04:25.509
You really pick odd things
to brag about.

04:25.600 --> 04:27.989
I'm just saying,
if I had to get three by lunch,

04:28.080 --> 04:29.832
I probably could.

04:29.920 --> 04:33.151
Hey, guys.
Gyno Girls, twelve o'clock.

04:35.800 --> 04:38.075
Obstetrics and Gynaecology
is a specialty

04:38.160 --> 04:40.071
that's usually
dominated by women.

04:43.760 --> 04:46.593
Dr Reid, I'm Dr Gerson.
We were just wondering

04:46.680 --> 04:49.114
if you have any thoughts
about your specialty,

04:49.200 --> 04:51.794
because we really think
you're OB/GYN material.

04:51.880 --> 04:54.872
Being a Gyno Girl
is a lot like being in a sorority.

05:00.280 --> 05:03.989
JD, I can't go with Dr Gerson
because I have to help you, right?

05:04.080 --> 05:07.277
Give me a second. I'm figuring
something out for a patient.

05:08.840 --> 05:11.673
I'm glad we all finally
experimented with each other,

05:11.760 --> 05:14.558
but I'll never do it again.

05:14.640 --> 05:16.596
Dammit.

05:18.400 --> 05:20.277
- Julie!
- Hey, Rob! Good to see you.

05:20.360 --> 05:22.555
Hey, Dan!

05:22.640 --> 05:26.030
God, I just hate that every doctor
you ever gave a drug sample to

05:26.120 --> 05:28.714
sniffs around you
like a little puppy dog.

05:28.800 --> 05:32.509
I never gave those guys anything.
I slept with them.

05:33.880 --> 05:35.472
Great.

05:36.440 --> 05:39.113
Those Gyno Girls
are putting the pressure on.

05:39.200 --> 05:42.192
We must have looked
at a hundred women's bajingos today.

05:42.280 --> 05:44.669
Bajingo, bajingo, bajingo.

05:44.760 --> 05:47.513
I mean, I can't even look
at my own bajingo, you know?

05:47.600 --> 05:49.989
Is that because
it looks so much like a vagina?

05:50.080 --> 05:52.514
Carla, there's people!
You know, forget it.

05:52.600 --> 05:54.875
I'm gonna tell them
I'm not interested.

05:54.960 --> 05:56.951
I think you should.

05:59.080 --> 06:03.198
- Sir, why are you laughing?
- Who knows?

06:03.280 --> 06:07.034
It could be the funny face
I made with my peas.

06:08.200 --> 06:11.476
But, gun to my head,
I'd say I'm laughing

06:11.560 --> 06:14.472
at the notion that you could
stand up to anyone.

06:20.120 --> 06:21.348
There we go.

06:21.440 --> 06:23.715
Moonlighting sucks,
but Turk and I make do.

06:23.800 --> 06:26.997
Now, will a lollipop
put a smile on your face?

06:27.080 --> 06:30.868
How about if Dr Turk sings
Jimmy Crack Corn?

06:30.960 --> 06:33.155
How about if Dr Turk sings
Jimmy Crack Corn

06:33.240 --> 06:35.674
as Neil Diamond?

06:35.760 --> 06:37.830
- OK.
- Hit it.

06:45.800 --> 06:47.153
Hold this for me.

06:58.280 --> 07:00.475
Dr Dorian, we could
use you again tomorrow

07:00.560 --> 07:04.155
if you'd like to make
another $300.

07:04.240 --> 07:06.879
300?

07:06.960 --> 07:11.317
Luckily for Turk,
revenge is a dish best served cold.

07:11.400 --> 07:13.391
Not unlike
this tapioca pudding.

07:13.480 --> 07:16.517
We're zeroing in on the guy
that's been stealing stuff.

07:16.600 --> 07:19.558
Oh. Well, that's good.

07:19.640 --> 07:24.031
Yep. In fact, right now
I'm dusting for fingerprints.

07:24.120 --> 07:27.112
- Really?
- Nah, I'm just dusting.

07:32.680 --> 07:35.672
I finished those discharge
dictations you wanted,

07:35.760 --> 07:38.797
and I was able to get
Mrs Jeskie on the transplant list.

07:38.880 --> 07:41.633
And here comes the wink.

07:41.720 --> 07:44.712
OK, maybe I'll start it off.

07:46.280 --> 07:49.909
My God, Sabrina, you had better
tell me you had laser eye surgery

07:50.000 --> 07:53.390
and they accidentally severed
the muscle that holds that lid up,

07:53.480 --> 07:55.357
because you did not
just wink at me.

07:55.440 --> 07:58.113
I didn't mean anything by it.
I wink at everybody.

07:58.200 --> 08:01.078
Hey, Dr Kelso.

08:01.160 --> 08:03.515
Save it
for the bathhouses, sport.

08:03.600 --> 08:04.874
Oh, boy.

08:04.960 --> 08:06.518
Don't be angry at Bambi.

08:06.600 --> 08:09.239
I'm not. My girlfriend
serviced most of the staff.

08:09.320 --> 08:11.470
I'm proud of her commitment
to medicine.

08:11.560 --> 08:13.630
What about the women
you've slept with?

08:13.720 --> 08:16.188
Your ex-wife, that med student,
your ex-wife,

08:16.280 --> 08:18.475
the radiology nurse,
your ex-wife...

08:18.560 --> 08:21.154
- Would you get off my ex-wife?
- I will if you will.

08:22.840 --> 08:26.276
Dammit. Gosh, now I'm too proud
of you to be mad at you.

08:28.960 --> 08:30.996
So, Dad, how are things at home?

08:31.080 --> 08:34.833
Good, good. Your mom
re-did the bedroom again.

08:34.919 --> 08:37.229
I'm going to keep mine
the way it is.

08:37.320 --> 08:41.073
You don't want to be a couple
that does everything together.

08:42.120 --> 08:44.873
Sorry.

08:44.960 --> 08:46.951
- Hello?
- I just wanted you to know,

08:47.040 --> 08:48.712
I faced up
to those Gyno Girls

08:48.800 --> 08:51.155
with a very strong and clear
"no, thank you."

08:51.240 --> 08:54.437
Yes, I heard about your note.

08:55.600 --> 08:57.556
The point is that I'm out.

08:59.080 --> 09:03.198
That was your mom.
She said to say something.

09:03.280 --> 09:05.669
So, did Dr Gerson
ever contact you?

09:05.760 --> 09:07.273
You told her to talk to me?

09:07.360 --> 09:10.193
She went to med school
with a colleague at my hospital.

09:10.280 --> 09:12.555
Come on, I want to go
see the department.

09:13.960 --> 09:18.158
Paging Dr Backbone
to the Bajingo Ward.

09:21.720 --> 09:23.950
You wanna grab
a couple of beers tonight?

09:24.040 --> 09:26.349
Can't. I'm moonlighting
at urgent care.

09:26.440 --> 09:28.476
That's funny.
The lady didn't call me.

09:28.560 --> 09:30.949
Because I found out
you stole $1 00 from me,

09:31.040 --> 09:33.110
- and I Marcia Brady'd your ass.
- What?

09:33.200 --> 09:35.395
When Marcia worked
at the ice-cream shop,

09:35.480 --> 09:37.914
and she got Jan a job,
and they liked Jan better

09:38.000 --> 09:39.399
so they fired Marcia.

09:39.480 --> 09:42.153
Marcia Gets Creamed,
season five, episode three.

09:42.240 --> 09:44.310
Don't ever question me
on The Bunch.

09:44.400 --> 09:46.789
There's no way
they liked you better than me.

09:46.880 --> 09:50.190
Then maybe it's because I told her
that you smoke the ganja.

09:50.280 --> 09:54.068
What? That's not even true.
You're a jackass.

09:54.160 --> 09:56.754
Where you going? Munchies?

09:59.040 --> 10:01.793
- Stay tuned for Survivor.
- I so don't think so.

10:01.880 --> 10:03.711
Hey, I was watching that.

10:03.800 --> 10:06.394
I know, but it's my place,
so it's house rules.

10:06.480 --> 10:09.199
Look, I feel like I owe you
an apology here.

10:09.280 --> 10:11.032
Really? For what?

10:11.120 --> 10:13.395
Just for being so jealous
and pissy lately.

10:13.480 --> 10:15.710
I guess I just kinda
got hung up on the fact

10:15.800 --> 10:17.950
that you were with,
you know, Dr Jasper,

10:18.040 --> 10:21.157
and Dr Michaels,

10:21.240 --> 10:23.435
and Dr Stone...
Was it his ear hair?

10:23.520 --> 10:26.318
Is that what was so compelling
about him? Never mind.

10:26.400 --> 10:28.755
The point is that
this relationship here

10:28.840 --> 10:31.434
is about the present,
and it's about the future,

10:31.520 --> 10:33.875
and I won't let anything
from our past

10:33.960 --> 10:35.552
ever get in our way again.

10:35.640 --> 10:37.835
- Deal?
- Deal.

10:40.240 --> 10:41.878
Keys still work.

10:46.360 --> 10:48.271
Excellent.

10:54.360 --> 10:56.555
Jordan, please tell me you
ate a raccoon

10:56.640 --> 10:59.791
and it's making its way
through your digestive system.

10:59.880 --> 11:01.711
Don't worry.
It's not your baby.

11:01.800 --> 11:04.712
Though not for lack of trying.
See, we have sex a lot.

11:04.800 --> 11:07.758
- Who are you?
- Who do you think I am?

11:07.840 --> 11:10.229
Well, you have keys
to the apartment,

11:10.320 --> 11:13.551
so I'm gonna say the maid.

11:13.640 --> 11:15.437
Julie, this is
my ex-wife, Jordan.

11:15.520 --> 11:17.670
Jordan, this is
my girlfriend, Julie.

11:17.760 --> 11:19.398
OK, that was a treat,
wasn't it?

11:19.480 --> 11:21.391
Would you like me
to call you a cab,

11:21.480 --> 11:24.597
or have the flying monkeys
bring the broom around?

11:24.680 --> 11:27.274
Oh, no.
He called you his girlfriend.

11:27.360 --> 11:30.193
If I were you,
I'd gather your tiny panties up,

11:30.280 --> 11:31.793
because I think you're done.

11:31.880 --> 11:34.713
I'm already bored by you.
I will be in the bedroom.

11:34.800 --> 11:36.677
Come join me when Tubby leaves.

11:40.480 --> 11:42.072
Who did that to you?

11:42.160 --> 11:44.355
I was at this
fabulous hotel in Greece,

11:44.440 --> 11:46.635
chock full of available,
wealthy men...

11:46.720 --> 11:49.951
- So it was the bellboy?
- Or busboy, or pool-boy.

11:50.040 --> 11:51.792
Something "boy." I don't know.

11:51.880 --> 11:54.269
Anyway, when I first
found out, I panicked.

11:54.360 --> 11:58.069
Then I thought, I've been drifting
through life all these years.

11:58.160 --> 12:01.709
I need to look into my heart
and see what really matters to me.

12:01.800 --> 12:03.916
Anyway, I decided
to keep the stupid kid.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.037
Cut out the middle man
and have a therapist deliver him.

12:07.120 --> 12:09.554
Honestly, Jordan,
why are you telling me this?

12:09.640 --> 12:13.997
Because I've also decided
that I want you back.

12:16.840 --> 12:19.274
Yep, we got him.
And he's gonna pay.

12:19.360 --> 12:22.750
They're arresting him
for stealing pudding and toilet paper?

12:22.840 --> 12:25.957
No, they found 20 bottles
of Vicodin in his backpack.

12:26.040 --> 12:28.634
Did you steal pudding
and toilet paper?

12:28.720 --> 12:31.757
What? No! I hate pudding
and I don't use toilet paper.

12:31.840 --> 12:33.637
I have one of
those French things

12:33.720 --> 12:36.473
that shoots water up your butt.

12:36.560 --> 12:39.233
- Bidet?
- Bidet to you, sir.

12:47.040 --> 12:48.632
- I miss you.
- I miss you too.

12:48.720 --> 12:51.029
I thought I was going
to see you last night.

12:51.120 --> 12:52.917
I frickin' caught an EMT shift,

12:53.000 --> 12:55.309
and I was riding
in an ambulance all night.

12:55.400 --> 12:57.675
That's cool.
Did they let you run the siren?

12:57.760 --> 12:59.876
I'm not talking to you. And yes.

12:59.960 --> 13:02.838
- Quit being such a baby.
- Bab... You stole my job.

13:02.920 --> 13:06.595
- You stole my money.
- That was a finder's fee.

13:06.680 --> 13:08.398
Oh, yeah? Well, find this!

13:08.480 --> 13:11.233
You should grab your crotch
when you say that.

13:11.320 --> 13:12.639
Wouldn't that hurt?

13:16.560 --> 13:19.438
So this is where we all hang out.
It's neat, huh?

13:19.520 --> 13:22.080
It's a hellhole.

13:22.160 --> 13:27.234
Dad, why...are you so set
on me being an OB/GYN?

13:27.320 --> 13:29.709
Look, honey,
your highest income potential

13:29.800 --> 13:33.793
as a female physician
is in obstetrics.

13:33.880 --> 13:36.474
But don't you think
that maybe it's time

13:36.560 --> 13:39.358
that you left those
sort of things up to me?

13:39.440 --> 13:41.510
Well, since I paid
for your college,

13:41.600 --> 13:43.318
your medical school, your car,

13:43.400 --> 13:46.073
and now your apartment
and your living expenses,

13:46.160 --> 13:47.832
I'd have to say "no."

13:49.120 --> 13:51.953
Good God. Someone vomited
on my hotdog.

13:52.040 --> 13:54.508
It's chilli, Dad, OK?
And you know what?

13:54.600 --> 13:57.672
I appreciate everything
you've given me, but it's my life.

13:57.760 --> 14:01.309
Now stop complaining
and enjoy your damn meal.

14:04.760 --> 14:07.433
Oh, my God. That's disgusting.

14:09.880 --> 14:12.110
Jordan, I don't know
what to tell you.

14:12.200 --> 14:13.997
Are you ever coming in, Perry?

14:14.080 --> 14:17.038
You can join us,
but I doubt you'll fit on the bed.

14:17.120 --> 14:20.317
OK, have one last fling,
but I'll be back, and until then,

14:20.400 --> 14:22.311
everywhere you look,
you'll see me.

14:22.400 --> 14:24.789
Everywhere anybody looks,
they'll see you.

14:24.880 --> 14:26.950
- Oh, it is so on.
- Bring it.

14:27.040 --> 14:29.190
Oh, God...

15:26.520 --> 15:28.909
Oh, I think I'm gonna be sick.

15:30.040 --> 15:31.871
So now you're ignoring me?

15:31.960 --> 15:34.554
Because of you I gotta ride
around in an ambulance

15:34.640 --> 15:36.596
and you know I get carsick.

15:36.680 --> 15:39.956
Come on, Turk. Turk.

15:40.040 --> 15:42.873
Hey, idiot. Ha. I said
"idiot" and you looked.

15:42.960 --> 15:45.474
Hey, help me carry
this computer to my van.

15:45.560 --> 15:47.949
You can't just take a computer.

15:48.040 --> 15:50.315
Help me or we check
the trunk of your car.

15:50.400 --> 15:52.311
Stay low.

15:55.920 --> 15:58.992
Look, morning sickness sucks.
Believe me, I know.

15:59.080 --> 16:00.911
I've been there.

16:01.000 --> 16:05.471
Hey, Jordan, are you...
Are you crying?

16:05.560 --> 16:09.030
No. I don't know.

16:09.120 --> 16:11.076
I'm just completely hormonal.

16:11.160 --> 16:13.913
I mean, you try going
from out-of-control horny

16:14.000 --> 16:16.719
to clinically depressed
six times a day.

16:16.800 --> 16:19.598
Give me a break. I can knock
that out on the way to work.

16:21.680 --> 16:25.639
Hey, lady, I'm proud
of what you're doing here.

16:25.720 --> 16:28.996
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

16:29.080 --> 16:30.957
Thanks.

16:32.560 --> 16:36.473
Last chance.
Do you want me or not?

16:38.640 --> 16:41.598
Oh, Jordan, I'm so sorry, but...

16:42.760 --> 16:47.311
Forget it. I was kidding.
I was kidding, really.

16:47.400 --> 16:50.119
- Help me up.
- Help you up? Help me up.

16:50.200 --> 16:52.316
You'll need two hands.

16:52.400 --> 16:54.595
You think you could help me out?

16:54.680 --> 16:56.636
Carla, why won't Turk
let this go?

16:56.720 --> 16:59.154
Marie, she's only with you
for one week.

16:59.240 --> 17:01.993
- Carla...
- Hold on a second.

17:02.080 --> 17:04.799
Bambi, I've got ten messages
from my mother,

17:04.880 --> 17:07.473
my Aunt Marie keeps
calling me about my mother,

17:07.560 --> 17:09.949
I gotta run home
and put out canned cat food

17:10.040 --> 17:12.429
because the dry stuff
doesn't cut it anymore,

17:12.520 --> 17:14.431
plus Turk and l
can't be together

17:14.520 --> 17:17.114
cos I'm working doubles
and he's moonlighting

17:17.200 --> 17:20.237
so we can send my mother
to a decent retirement community.

17:20.319 --> 17:23.311
- So what, Bambi, what?
- We'll talk later.

17:23.400 --> 17:26.994
Carla said something that made
me realize what I had to do.

17:27.079 --> 17:29.992
That's it for me.
I'm gonna get my stuff and leave.

17:34.040 --> 17:36.395
- What are you doing in here?
- She said "we."

17:36.480 --> 17:38.118
- What?
- Carla, she said "we."

17:38.200 --> 17:40.634
"We" need to scrape
some money together.

17:40.720 --> 17:43.280
And it wasn't just like
a "we're dating" we.

17:43.360 --> 17:46.557
It was a "we're gonna spend the
rest of our lives together" we.

17:46.640 --> 17:49.359
I don't know, man.
That just seems big to me.

17:49.440 --> 17:51.749
Yeah, I know.

17:51.840 --> 17:55.469
Can I run the siren?

17:55.560 --> 17:57.994
Yeah, all right. Make it quick.

17:58.520 --> 18:01.114
So you finally stood up
to your father?

18:01.200 --> 18:02.519
Yep.

18:02.600 --> 18:04.716
And he cut you off,
no money, no nothing?

18:04.800 --> 18:07.268
- Pretty much.
- Jerk.

18:07.360 --> 18:10.591
Wow, this is a big place.

18:10.680 --> 18:13.831
Do you know where I could
find some boxes?

18:19.720 --> 18:24.077
So, is your ex-wife like,
"all women are crazy" crazy,

18:24.160 --> 18:28.233
or more like "that assistant
who tasered David Spade" crazy?

18:28.320 --> 18:30.151
You've got to try and understand,

18:30.240 --> 18:32.629
she's going through
a rough time right now,

18:32.720 --> 18:34.711
and she's used to leaning on me,

18:34.800 --> 18:37.678
which in her current condition
is actually causing me

18:37.760 --> 18:40.752
more physical pain
than it is emotional.

18:40.840 --> 18:43.877
But, still,
it sure was silly of her

18:43.960 --> 18:47.236
to try to make me choose
between the two of you.

18:49.320 --> 18:51.993
I guess it was a pretty
easy decision, huh?

18:57.360 --> 19:00.591
Well, when I really had a chance
to think about it,

19:00.680 --> 19:04.275
it turns out it was the easiest
decision I ever made.

19:04.360 --> 19:07.033
I was always going
to wind up with you.

19:07.120 --> 19:10.112
So the whole vulnerable
crying thing worked, huh?

19:10.200 --> 19:13.795
I never had a chance.

19:13.880 --> 19:16.110
You do realize I'm pregnant,
don't you?

19:16.200 --> 19:19.397
Yeah, they're both for me.

19:19.480 --> 19:21.357
Cheers.

19:21.440 --> 19:24.716
You know, I keep waiting
to get sick of pudding,

19:24.800 --> 19:26.631
but with every cup
I love it more.

19:26.720 --> 19:27.994
Me, too.

19:30.360 --> 19:32.316
So, you gonna marry her?

19:32.400 --> 19:35.073
Yeah, I think so.

19:40.120 --> 19:42.429
- I'm sorry I ripped you off.
- Ah, forget it.

19:42.520 --> 19:44.351
You can keep the hundred bucks.

19:44.440 --> 19:47.352
I was gonna, man.

19:47.440 --> 19:49.874
I was gonna.

19:49.960 --> 19:52.679
I usually don't like
thinking about the future.

19:55.240 --> 19:58.152
Let's face it, you can't
predict what's gonna happen.

19:59.960 --> 20:02.269
But sometimes
the thing you didn't expect

20:02.360 --> 20:04.920
is what you really wanted
after all.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.798
Maybe the best thing to do
is stop trying to figure out

20:07.880 --> 20:10.394
where you're going
and enjoy where you're at.

20:10.480 --> 20:12.789
All right, now,
who wants a refill?

20:12.880 --> 20:16.919
- I can't afford this place.
- Elliot, I'm $1 30,000 in debt.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.878
You're gonna be all right.

20:21.920 --> 20:24.354
Come on, let's dance, stud.
