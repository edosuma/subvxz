00:00.042 --> 00:01.894
Previously on "Once Upon a Time"...

00:01.919 --> 00:04.563
- Drizella has always been awake.
- What does she want now?

00:04.588 --> 00:05.754
Your suffering.

00:05.856 --> 00:08.317
Regina told me things you never would...

00:08.342 --> 00:11.209
A little thing called The Dark Curse.

00:11.311 --> 00:12.544
Who the hell are you looking for?

00:12.646 --> 00:13.906
The Guardian.

00:13.931 --> 00:15.597
The Darkness will finally rest,

00:15.699 --> 00:17.365
and I will be reunited with Belle.

00:17.434 --> 00:18.833
I'm going to San Francisco.

00:18.936 --> 00:20.435
What the hell is in San Francisco?

00:20.537 --> 00:21.870
Someone who can help us.

00:21.972 --> 00:23.204
When your beliefs betray you,

00:23.307 --> 00:24.372
you must let them go.

00:24.474 --> 00:26.007
It's time.

00:26.109 --> 00:27.909
Lucy, what's wrong?

00:31.572 --> 00:34.115
Oh. Oh, no!

00:34.217 --> 00:36.045
Lucy.

00:37.654 --> 00:39.454
Mama's right here, baby.

00:40.891 --> 00:43.291
I'm right here. It's gonna be fine.

00:43.393 --> 00:44.426
We're almost there.

00:51.568 --> 00:55.203
I'd like you all to meet... Lucy.

00:56.694 --> 01:00.696
That is amazing. Henry
Mills is a father.

01:00.721 --> 01:03.457
Congratulations. She looks strong.

01:04.214 --> 01:06.281
Uh, where's my mom? She
should be here by now?

01:06.383 --> 01:08.264
Oh, Regina's fine.

01:08.289 --> 01:10.385
She's just a little detained.

01:11.455 --> 01:12.554
Stay away from my daughter.

01:12.656 --> 01:15.056
Such a worried papa.

01:15.158 --> 01:16.558
No need to be.

01:16.660 --> 01:19.527
I'm only here to deliver a message.

01:19.552 --> 01:23.387
Well, more accurately, a prophecy.

01:23.412 --> 01:24.966
A curse is coming.

01:25.068 --> 01:28.737
On your darling child's 8th birthday,

01:29.598 --> 01:32.173
all your lives as you
know them will end.

01:32.275 --> 01:34.609
Perhaps you misread the prophecy, love,

01:34.711 --> 01:36.778
because you missed the
part where we defeat you.

01:36.880 --> 01:38.780
Drizella, I wouldn't.

01:39.476 --> 01:40.842
Look down.

01:42.000 --> 01:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here

01:51.028 --> 01:53.028
This is blood magic.

01:53.130 --> 01:54.729
How is this possible?

01:54.831 --> 01:58.199
With a spatter of my blood, of course.

01:58.301 --> 02:00.669
I simply can't have you
casting the curse, dear.

02:00.771 --> 02:02.804
This changes nothing.

02:02.906 --> 02:04.873
In eight years, I'll be back,

02:04.975 --> 02:07.442
and you'll learn what true suffering is.

02:24.556 --> 02:27.658
_

02:31.535 --> 02:33.668
Thank you all for coming to celebrate

02:33.770 --> 02:36.938
the birthday of a special little girl,

02:37.040 --> 02:39.007
and to remember how lucky we are

02:39.109 --> 02:41.643
to live in a time of
peace and prosperity.

02:41.745 --> 02:44.012
Thank you, Aunt Tiana.

02:44.114 --> 02:48.616
- I mean, Queen Tiana.
- Oh.

02:48.719 --> 02:49.818
Can I light the candles?

02:49.920 --> 02:52.387
Oh, no, that's my job.

02:56.359 --> 02:58.259
Now, make a wish.

03:06.503 --> 03:07.736
What the bloody hell is that?

03:21.651 --> 03:24.119
Look at all this.

03:24.221 --> 03:28.156
Cake, presents, family.

03:28.258 --> 03:31.526
Did you really think this
would be a day of celebration?

03:32.596 --> 03:34.095
Don't try anything, love.

03:34.197 --> 03:36.531
There's no way you can
fight all of us alone.

03:36.633 --> 03:38.032
Who says I'm alone?

03:52.482 --> 03:55.817
That's impossible. Blood
magic can't be broken.

03:55.919 --> 03:57.385
Not by any single person,

03:57.487 --> 03:59.888
but together, this
family can do anything.

04:01.224 --> 04:02.724
Come, Drizella.

04:02.826 --> 04:05.927
In days, here, the
prophecy shall be fulfilled.

04:06.029 --> 04:09.653
Your curse will be cast.

04:09.766 --> 04:12.433
The suffering shall begin.

04:35.725 --> 04:38.259
She's gonna be fine, Jay.

04:38.361 --> 04:40.562
She's the toughest kid I know.

04:40.664 --> 04:42.564
Do you want to call anyone?

04:42.632 --> 04:44.199
Nick or Henry?

04:44.267 --> 04:45.333
Yeah, I should call them.

04:45.402 --> 04:46.801
And I'll call Detective Rogers.

04:46.870 --> 04:47.875
Maybe he can help us figure out

04:47.900 --> 04:50.271
where Lucy was today,
what she was doing.

04:50.373 --> 04:52.540
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

04:52.609 --> 04:53.908
That would mean a lot.

04:53.977 --> 04:55.210
I'm so glad you're here.

04:55.278 --> 04:57.719
Oh, honey, don't worry, okay?

04:57.930 --> 04:59.480
Look, one way or another,

04:59.583 --> 05:01.316
we are going to find out what happened.

05:02.485 --> 05:04.819
Yeah.

05:11.561 --> 05:14.095
Your daughter looks quite peaceful.

05:15.432 --> 05:19.100
She's adjusting to this strange,
new world, thanks to you.

05:19.202 --> 05:21.069
I never would have helped you

05:21.137 --> 05:23.071
had I known Lucy was
gonna pay the price.

05:23.173 --> 05:25.139
But you did help me

05:25.242 --> 05:27.809
because you were desperate
to find the Guardian.

05:27.878 --> 05:29.667
And I did find her.

05:29.692 --> 05:31.191
She's right there in this room.

05:31.216 --> 05:33.648
No, my daughter is not your Guardian.

05:33.750 --> 05:35.516
Gothel believed she was...

05:35.619 --> 05:37.986
and I'd like to find out for myself.

05:38.088 --> 05:39.454
And if I'm right,

05:39.522 --> 05:42.490
her magic may be able to save Lucy,

05:42.559 --> 05:44.692
but not if she dies today.

05:44.761 --> 05:48.055
Drizella and Gothel are still out there,

05:48.080 --> 05:50.055
and I very much doubt they've given up.

05:50.829 --> 05:55.203
You have no choice but
to let me protect her.

06:12.255 --> 06:14.555
Henry, is everything all right?

06:14.624 --> 06:18.426
I missed a call from Jacinda,
and now she's not picking up.

06:18.495 --> 06:19.994
I just... I don't know.

06:20.096 --> 06:21.183
I feel like something's wrong.

06:21.208 --> 06:24.456
Well, if she needs you,
that woman is not shy.

06:24.481 --> 06:25.767
Put your phone away and focus.

06:25.835 --> 06:27.802
We came here for a reason.

06:27.827 --> 06:31.039
Now... put these on.

06:34.411 --> 06:36.311
♪ Yeah ♪

06:36.490 --> 06:38.189
Now I'm even more confused.

06:38.214 --> 06:40.481
Did I just drive halfway down
the West Coast to work my quads?

06:40.583 --> 06:45.581
Just play along and pretend
you love every second of it.

06:45.606 --> 06:47.021
Good morning, beautiful souls.

06:47.123 --> 06:48.890
This is the person we're looking for.

06:48.992 --> 06:53.594
You're all about to sweat
like your life depends on it.

06:54.418 --> 06:56.764
All right, my cycling monkeys.

06:56.789 --> 06:59.434
Grab onto your bikes and fly!

06:59.536 --> 07:00.668
Whoo!

07:14.893 --> 07:17.160
Hey, Luce.

07:17.236 --> 07:19.670
We hope Drizella didn't scare you.

07:19.765 --> 07:22.699
We stopped her once,
we can stop her again.

07:22.768 --> 07:24.234
- Okay?
- That's right.

07:24.303 --> 07:27.804
We have a plan to make sure
the curse can't hurt us.

07:27.873 --> 07:29.139
Yeah. And you're a part of it.

07:29.208 --> 07:30.941
Does that mean I get a sword?

07:31.009 --> 07:33.476
One thing at a time, sweetheart.

07:33.501 --> 07:35.749
Why don't you start packing, all right?

07:42.388 --> 07:45.222
I don't know about this, Henry.

07:45.324 --> 07:47.491
Are we doing the right thing?

07:47.593 --> 07:49.025
If Regina can't stop the curse,

07:49.094 --> 07:52.429
it's the only way to keep her safe,

07:52.531 --> 07:54.498
to keep all of us safe.

08:00.132 --> 08:03.266
_

08:28.767 --> 08:30.688
I'm impressed.

08:32.169 --> 08:34.135
You're getting good.

08:35.140 --> 08:38.140
Aunt Regina.

08:38.210 --> 08:39.842
Oh, Aunt Regina, I'm so sorry.

08:39.912 --> 08:41.544
I thought you were an intruder.

08:41.570 --> 08:43.813
Well, luckily, she's
got her father's aim.

08:43.881 --> 08:45.649
Those were warning shots, weren't they?

08:45.717 --> 08:47.617
Yes, of course, Mother.
Just warning shots.

08:47.686 --> 08:49.740
Zelena, it is so good to see you.

08:50.685 --> 08:54.324
And Robin? You're, what, 23 now?

08:54.426 --> 08:55.492
25.

08:55.594 --> 08:57.561
She sure has grown up fast.

08:57.663 --> 08:59.129
Not in our realm. Right.

08:59.198 --> 09:01.987
Well, I'm not here to discuss timelines.

09:02.019 --> 09:03.900
Drizella's free.

09:03.969 --> 09:06.169
And she's trying to cast the curse.

09:06.238 --> 09:08.872
She was rescued by some creatures.

09:08.941 --> 09:10.173
Let me guess.

09:10.242 --> 09:11.541
They look like shadows in cloaks,

09:11.643 --> 09:13.109
but they scream like hyenas.

09:13.178 --> 09:14.203
You know them?

09:14.228 --> 09:16.947
They're not creatures. They're witches.

09:17.049 --> 09:19.883
It's a dark coven, and one
that I was invited to join.

09:19.985 --> 09:21.885
This was dropped off
on my porch yesterday.

09:21.987 --> 09:23.487
Have you seen it before?

09:23.589 --> 09:25.322
It's a symbol of the Coven of the Eight.

09:25.390 --> 09:27.858
When it comes to witches,
they're the worst of the worst.

09:27.960 --> 09:29.526
If they're here, I have to warn...

09:29.628 --> 09:30.594
No, don't worry.

09:30.696 --> 09:32.262
Look, darling, we'll
warn everyone, okay?

09:32.364 --> 09:34.231
We'll protect our loved ones.

09:34.333 --> 09:36.481
She's got a case of young love.

09:36.506 --> 09:39.970
Well, then, all the
more reason to get going.

09:40.420 --> 09:43.340
Hook's looking for Rumple, but...

09:43.408 --> 09:45.342
Well, you know how he is.

09:45.410 --> 09:50.380
So, I say we fight witches with witches.

09:50.449 --> 09:51.659
What do you say?

09:54.953 --> 09:56.853
Let me get my wand.

10:04.110 --> 10:06.062
What the hell are you doing here, Roni?

10:06.087 --> 10:07.464
This is my happy place,

10:07.533 --> 10:09.666
and you are the epicenter
of my unhappiness.

10:09.691 --> 10:11.768
Yes, no, I-I know.

10:11.870 --> 10:14.437
Um, I'm sorry to barge in like this,

10:14.540 --> 10:19.743
but, uh, we... we
really loved your class.

10:19.811 --> 10:22.679
Big time. Very inspiring.

10:22.748 --> 10:24.047
- Very.
- Hi.

10:24.149 --> 10:26.249
Whoever you are, stop talking.

10:26.318 --> 10:27.686
Be somewhere else.

10:27.711 --> 10:31.079
Great. Glad I came all this way.

10:33.287 --> 10:34.758
Who's that? New boyfriend?

10:34.783 --> 10:37.050
Hmm? No. No! God, no.

10:37.229 --> 10:39.696
No, no, no, no. He's, uh...

10:39.798 --> 10:41.331
He's just someone who needed help.

10:41.433 --> 10:43.833
And what do you need, Roni?

10:43.936 --> 10:45.569
Why are you even here?

10:45.594 --> 10:47.404
Because every time I see your face,

10:47.472 --> 10:49.306
I see the bitch that
ruined my daughter's life.

10:49.374 --> 10:51.541
I didn't ruin her life.

10:51.610 --> 10:54.578
You gave her a job at the
bar, a ticket to Amsterdam,

10:54.680 --> 10:57.147
and the idea that only
losers get an education.

10:57.215 --> 10:58.949
And now, instead of going to Vassar,

10:59.051 --> 11:00.637
she's at a foam party in Phuket

11:00.662 --> 11:03.896
and probably never
coming home because Mum...

11:04.629 --> 11:06.356
just isn't as cool.

11:08.325 --> 11:10.792
I'm sorry.

11:10.996 --> 11:16.132
But I don't think you
understand the whole story here.

11:17.592 --> 11:19.993
Hey, let's grab a drink.

11:20.109 --> 11:22.676
Okay? Just one.

11:22.764 --> 11:24.898
For old time's sake?

11:25.077 --> 11:27.010
Never.

11:34.470 --> 11:35.862
I got to get home.

11:35.887 --> 11:37.153
Hm? What? Why?

11:37.255 --> 11:38.888
It's Lucy. She's in the hospital.

11:38.991 --> 11:40.357
No one knows what's wrong with her.

11:40.459 --> 11:41.691
I'm... I'm getting on the
first plane to Seattle.

11:41.716 --> 11:42.649
Do you want to come with?

11:42.674 --> 11:44.340
Uh...

11:44.423 --> 11:48.999
I-I really wish I could, but I...

11:49.024 --> 11:51.724
I can't explain it.
Kelly's really important.

11:51.903 --> 11:53.637
I will be there as soon as I can.

11:53.739 --> 11:55.205
I promise. But you go.

11:55.307 --> 11:57.807
Go be with them.

11:57.909 --> 12:00.176
Be with your fam...

12:00.566 --> 12:02.600
Help Jacinda.

12:04.683 --> 12:06.616
Here.

12:21.107 --> 12:23.440
Rumplestiltskin, we need your help.

12:23.509 --> 12:24.575
Gothel has freed Drizella.

12:24.677 --> 12:26.644
The prophecy is coming true.

12:26.712 --> 12:27.811
Surely you've got some kind of magic

12:27.914 --> 12:29.747
that can stop this curse.

12:29.815 --> 12:31.982
Well... I do have this.

12:32.785 --> 12:34.818
A white elephant.

12:34.887 --> 12:36.854
Are you familiar with the expression?

12:36.923 --> 12:37.944
A name we give to things

12:37.969 --> 12:41.325
who have outlived their useful lives,

12:41.427 --> 12:43.727
and yet persist.

12:43.829 --> 12:45.663
And I find that personally quite moving.

12:45.731 --> 12:47.798
Enough games.

12:47.867 --> 12:49.566
Will this help stop the
curse from happening?

12:49.669 --> 12:51.402
Stop it? No, deary.

12:51.470 --> 12:52.903
Nothing can stop it.

12:52.972 --> 12:53.980
But when the curse comes,

12:54.005 --> 12:58.542
that can keep your most
precious relationship intact.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.611
Alice.

13:00.713 --> 13:02.613
So we will remember who we are?

13:02.682 --> 13:04.214
No.

13:04.283 --> 13:06.250
Your memories will be replaced.

13:06.319 --> 13:08.419
But in the random tumult of the curse,

13:08.521 --> 13:12.489
it ensures you will still
be father and daughter.

13:12.591 --> 13:13.991
You're doing this for me?

13:15.167 --> 13:17.795
I'm doing it for her.

13:19.616 --> 13:20.931
Alice?

13:27.173 --> 13:29.173
Are you sure this is
still where you want to be?

13:29.275 --> 13:31.475
Knowing what he gave up for me,

13:31.765 --> 13:34.253
I owe it to him to stay by his side.

13:35.081 --> 13:37.681
And who knows,

13:37.783 --> 13:39.824
maybe our cursed
memories would be better.

13:43.422 --> 13:46.056
Fewer trees and walls in the way.

13:46.125 --> 13:48.258
Yes.

13:48.327 --> 13:50.426
But, Papa, if it
happens, I will lose her.

13:50.451 --> 13:53.188
No, don't say that, love. Don't.

13:53.730 --> 13:56.467
True love can win out over so much more.

13:57.548 --> 13:59.103
I hope so.

14:01.251 --> 14:04.241
Please give this to her for me.

14:04.310 --> 14:08.912
I don't have one for you, but
you already know how I feel.

14:10.883 --> 14:12.449
I'll deliver it.

14:13.753 --> 14:14.985
But I'm gonna do my best to make sure

14:15.054 --> 14:16.620
that nothing parts any of us.

14:16.722 --> 14:19.923
I hope that's enough.

14:19.992 --> 14:21.358
Take it.

14:35.597 --> 14:39.232
Anything you can remember about
seeing this girl around yesterday.

14:44.917 --> 14:46.683
Things disappear if you don't
look at them quick enough.

14:46.786 --> 14:48.318
Tilly, I don't have time for riddles.

14:48.387 --> 14:49.586
There's a little girl in the hospital.

14:49.688 --> 14:51.722
This is bigger than a little girl.

14:51.791 --> 14:53.724
Do you remember that symbol
from Eloise's notebook?

14:53.793 --> 14:56.326
And the dead man's tattoo.
I'd hardly forget it.

14:59.999 --> 15:03.467
Then look before it disappears.

15:08.674 --> 15:10.107
What the hell is going on here?

15:17.464 --> 15:18.696
Hey.

15:18.721 --> 15:21.132
I came as soon as I got your message.

15:53.619 --> 15:54.929
What are you still doing here?

15:56.011 --> 15:57.087
I waited for you,

15:57.156 --> 15:58.489
and you'll be glad I did,

15:58.557 --> 15:59.923
because I know deep down

16:00.025 --> 16:03.393
underneath all that overwhelming
anger and resentment,

16:03.462 --> 16:05.662
you'll soon see that all
of this was meaningless.

16:05.764 --> 16:07.764
- It wasn't meaningless.
- You'll see.

16:07.789 --> 16:09.322
You'll remember.

16:11.739 --> 16:14.106
You know, we were like sisters.

16:14.874 --> 16:16.507
I'm sorry I ever felt that way.

16:18.744 --> 16:20.110
You need a drink.

16:23.215 --> 16:24.248
I'd rather have some of that

16:24.350 --> 16:25.682
cucumber-mint-honey lavender water

16:25.784 --> 16:27.795
if it will make you leave me alone.

16:30.365 --> 16:32.623
No, no, no.

16:32.725 --> 16:34.491
I am not leaving

16:34.593 --> 16:37.494
until you have a real drink with me.

16:52.378 --> 16:53.510
Ugh.

16:55.245 --> 16:56.046
I wish I had

16:56.071 --> 16:58.238
the cucumber-mint-honey lavender water.

16:59.399 --> 17:00.817
Ugh.

17:00.927 --> 17:02.000
Okay.

17:02.025 --> 17:04.488
Okay, I've never been great at subtle.

17:04.589 --> 17:05.722
We're cursed.

17:05.790 --> 17:08.025
You don't remember it,
but we really are sisters.

17:08.127 --> 17:09.259
Evil Queen, Wicked Witch.

17:09.284 --> 17:10.627
What are you talking ab...

17:16.935 --> 17:17.968
Sister.

17:18.069 --> 17:19.670
There's only one name
I can think of... Robin.

17:19.771 --> 17:21.371
We're not done, Regina.

17:21.473 --> 17:22.906
Not today.

17:30.993 --> 17:31.992
Zelena?

17:32.962 --> 17:34.484
What's going on?

17:36.222 --> 17:39.890
Oh, Regina.

17:39.959 --> 17:41.725
I teach pedaling.

17:41.794 --> 17:44.061
Oh, Zelena. Thank God.

17:44.163 --> 17:46.697
Oh. Oh, I was cursed.

17:46.799 --> 17:48.031
To be a hippie!

17:48.133 --> 17:50.267
Listen to me. We have a problem.

17:50.874 --> 17:52.669
Gothel's out,

17:52.771 --> 17:54.738
and Lucy's in terrible danger.

17:54.840 --> 17:55.939
Things have been changing so fast.

17:56.041 --> 17:57.674
I need you to come back
with me to Hyperion Heights.

17:57.776 --> 18:00.544
Yeah, you're right. Someone
needs to pay for this.

18:01.698 --> 18:04.381
I am so glad you're back.

18:06.885 --> 18:08.452
What is it?

18:08.554 --> 18:09.886
It's just my...

18:09.989 --> 18:13.290
My curse persona, Kelly.

18:13.392 --> 18:14.791
I mean, I had a life here.

18:14.860 --> 18:17.327
Yeah, I know. I saw it.

18:17.352 --> 18:18.867
But it's time to leave all that behind.

18:18.892 --> 18:20.792
Regina.

18:22.601 --> 18:24.301
It's not that easy.

18:28.707 --> 18:30.641
I'm getting married.

18:41.620 --> 18:44.921
Now, I've performed
this test many times.

18:44.990 --> 18:47.724
Carried these blades a long way.

18:47.826 --> 18:49.226
It's quite simple.

18:49.295 --> 18:51.194
All you have to do

18:51.263 --> 18:55.707
is tell me which one of these has magic.

19:04.329 --> 19:06.153
Is it that one?

19:06.748 --> 19:08.915
No. It isn't.

19:26.984 --> 19:30.077
I think maybe it's in there.

19:44.777 --> 19:46.717
I don't want power if it's
gonna do things like that.

19:46.742 --> 19:49.252
Don't be afraid.

19:49.355 --> 19:51.555
This power can be used to help people,

19:51.657 --> 19:54.291
to heal people.

19:54.393 --> 19:57.361
In fact, there's a little girl

19:57.463 --> 20:00.063
who desperately needs your help.

20:00.088 --> 20:02.132
So, if you're ready,

20:02.681 --> 20:04.601
it's time to show what you can do.

20:10.126 --> 20:12.561
He's a good bloke, Regina.

20:12.586 --> 20:14.553
A real solid, regular guy.

20:14.622 --> 20:19.658
And I may have been
cursed, but... I was happy.

20:19.760 --> 20:22.027
Well, after we save Lucy

20:22.096 --> 20:25.697
and dispatch Gothel and Drizella,

20:25.766 --> 20:27.466
maybe you can come back
here and marry him then.

20:27.535 --> 20:29.768
Regina, how can I promise
to be faithful and true

20:29.870 --> 20:31.570
if I'm lying to him?

20:31.639 --> 20:33.605
It's no longer me, but it is also me.

20:33.674 --> 20:35.541
It's like I'm both.

20:35.566 --> 20:37.833
I mean, I still love him.

20:38.012 --> 20:40.979
I'm sorry, Zelena.

20:41.048 --> 20:43.715
Coming here was a big mistake.

20:43.740 --> 20:46.574
You have a life.

20:46.754 --> 20:48.120
I don't mean to screw it up.

20:48.222 --> 20:50.489
No, you're not. L-Listen.

20:50.591 --> 20:52.090
Look, I love you.

20:53.427 --> 20:56.361
And we have to save our family

20:56.464 --> 20:57.963
and our people,

20:58.065 --> 20:59.546
no matter what it means personally.

21:01.469 --> 21:04.470
I mean, that's what heroes do, right?

21:08.309 --> 21:09.475
Right.

21:13.380 --> 21:14.980
Okay.

21:15.082 --> 21:17.516
Let's go.

21:28.472 --> 21:31.296
She's so still right now.

21:31.365 --> 21:33.198
It's not right.

21:34.235 --> 21:36.602
She's a great kid.

21:38.055 --> 21:40.856
I just wish I could do more.

21:42.276 --> 21:45.944
Well, maybe you could read to her.

21:52.638 --> 21:57.356
From the second she saw the book
you wrote, she needed to have it.

21:57.424 --> 22:00.325
Whenever she looked at
it, it gave her strength.

22:00.427 --> 22:01.994
Yeah, okay.

22:06.184 --> 22:08.600
I know exactly what part to read, too.

22:30.991 --> 22:33.525
This is the oldest part of this realm...

22:33.594 --> 22:35.627
The original Enchanted Forest.

22:35.696 --> 22:38.964
This tree has the same magic
that took my mom to Storybrooke.

22:39.066 --> 22:40.766
How did you find this one tree

22:40.868 --> 22:43.869
with so many regular trees around it?

22:46.094 --> 22:48.224
I had some help from an old friend.

22:48.568 --> 22:50.542
Lucy, this is Tiger Lily.

22:50.611 --> 22:52.277
She's from Neverland, and she's a fairy.

22:52.379 --> 22:53.812
Pleased to meet you.

22:53.914 --> 22:55.147
Pleased to meet you, Lucy.

22:55.249 --> 22:58.216
I found Geppetto's axe.

22:58.995 --> 23:00.619
I think this should be up to the task.

23:00.688 --> 23:03.522
- Yeah.
- What are you going to do?

23:03.591 --> 23:05.390
Why are you cutting it down?

23:05.492 --> 23:07.793
Okay. Lucy, remember the wardrobe?

23:07.895 --> 23:10.227
No. No!

23:11.109 --> 23:13.142
Lucy, it's okay.

23:13.167 --> 23:15.000
It's okay. This is a last resort.

23:15.102 --> 23:17.035
If the curse happens,

23:17.137 --> 23:20.606
you and I go to the Land
Without Magic before it hits.

23:20.708 --> 23:22.388
Then we find our people.

23:24.157 --> 23:26.106
And with this book,

23:27.615 --> 23:29.481
we can help them believe again.

23:30.106 --> 23:32.517
It'll be dark soon.
You should get to work.

23:32.620 --> 23:34.186
Okay.

23:34.288 --> 23:36.488
Take Lucy to your place to sleep, okay?

23:38.292 --> 23:40.459
It's okay. It's okay.

23:40.561 --> 23:42.227
Just believe in me.

24:26.974 --> 24:28.507
Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.

24:28.609 --> 24:30.042
What is it, Father?

24:30.144 --> 24:32.344
It's time. They found us.

24:32.446 --> 24:34.572
Don't be frightened. It'll be all right.

24:34.597 --> 24:36.381
I'll stay behind, give
you time to escape.

24:36.450 --> 24:38.083
No, I won't leave you.

24:38.185 --> 24:40.775
- I'll help you fight.
- No, no, you can't.

24:40.800 --> 24:43.221
You have to make sure it stays safe.

24:43.323 --> 24:44.222
You have it, don't you?

24:44.324 --> 24:46.024
Of course.

24:46.126 --> 24:48.226
Oh. Oh, good.

24:48.976 --> 24:50.121
Daddy.

24:50.146 --> 24:51.563
Don't worry about me. You need to go.

24:51.665 --> 24:53.732
- I...
- I know.

24:53.834 --> 24:56.334
I know. Me, too.

24:56.593 --> 24:58.226
Go. Go!

25:13.679 --> 25:14.912
Mother!

25:15.222 --> 25:17.022
Lucy.

25:17.124 --> 25:18.156
What are you doing back here?

25:18.225 --> 25:19.591
They got him... The witches.

25:19.693 --> 25:20.725
They got Father.

25:20.827 --> 25:21.893
Then we have to get him back.

25:21.995 --> 25:23.762
Go. I'll stay with Lucy.

25:23.830 --> 25:25.363
Nothing will happen to her.

25:25.582 --> 25:27.282
Wait.

25:28.085 --> 25:30.468
This is exactly what Drizella wants...

25:30.763 --> 25:32.920
To distract us from stopping this curse.

25:33.025 --> 25:37.094
And if we don't, nothing will matter.

25:38.111 --> 25:39.711
Not even Henry.

26:09.176 --> 26:12.944
I have waited so many
years to cast this curse.

26:15.348 --> 26:17.982
Thank you for everything.

26:19.386 --> 26:22.087
You finally found a mother figure.

26:24.257 --> 26:27.525
You do realize that
she's just using you.

26:27.627 --> 26:29.994
You can't control me anymore.

26:30.097 --> 26:33.140
Now I'm going to control you.

26:33.165 --> 26:34.810
You see, in this new land,

26:34.835 --> 26:39.775
you're going to think
that you cast this curse.

26:39.915 --> 26:42.140
Why the hell would I cast a curse?

26:42.242 --> 26:44.509
To save Anastasia, of course.

26:44.578 --> 26:47.145
You're going to think
that you did all of this

26:47.214 --> 26:48.913
to help her,

26:48.982 --> 26:52.967
when actually, you'll
be in service to me.

26:52.992 --> 26:57.178
And then, I'm going to
rip her from your arms...

26:57.245 --> 26:58.826
forever.

26:59.420 --> 27:01.793
Now, stop asking silly questions,

27:01.895 --> 27:03.528
and go to sleep.

27:06.228 --> 27:09.234
Still working through
those mommy issues, I see.

27:09.595 --> 27:12.013
I bet we can help with that.

27:12.038 --> 27:13.404
We pretty much invented that.

27:13.507 --> 27:15.740
Regina. Zelena.

27:15.809 --> 27:17.142
Sisters together again.

27:17.210 --> 27:18.851
Afraid that's not going to be enough.

27:18.876 --> 27:21.310
Oh, she's not the only one I brought.

27:22.015 --> 27:24.382
Hello again, love.

27:24.484 --> 27:26.491
Always a pleasure, Captain.

27:26.991 --> 27:28.216
Ooh.

27:28.241 --> 27:32.247
A pirate, a princess, and
Jack and the beanstalk.

27:32.272 --> 27:34.788
Ooh, how will I ever defeat you?

27:40.467 --> 27:42.967
You want a witch fight?

27:43.434 --> 27:44.833
Happy to oblige.

27:50.797 --> 27:52.830
But as you can see,

27:53.137 --> 27:56.214
you will not be casting this curse.

27:56.626 --> 27:57.725
I know.

27:58.552 --> 28:00.952
That's why you're going to cast it.

28:01.054 --> 28:02.554
What?

28:02.656 --> 28:04.355
Show her.

28:05.035 --> 28:06.301
May I?

28:26.669 --> 28:28.202
Henry!

28:38.216 --> 28:39.715
Baby.

28:42.186 --> 28:43.395
What did you do to him?

28:43.420 --> 28:45.354
What witches do best...

28:45.423 --> 28:46.922
We poisoned him.

28:55.674 --> 28:57.666
It's not working!

28:57.768 --> 28:59.268
And it's not going to.

28:59.370 --> 29:02.461
As a matter of fact,
the only thing that can

29:02.491 --> 29:05.758
is a trip to a land without magic.

29:06.336 --> 29:08.937
Don't do this, Drizella.

29:09.498 --> 29:12.132
I can't just... can't just cast a curse.

29:12.201 --> 29:15.302
It takes time, and... ingredients.

29:15.404 --> 29:18.672
Eight, to be exact.

29:18.774 --> 29:22.008
And I have seven of them right here.

29:22.077 --> 29:25.712
The only one I'm missing...
the most important one,

29:25.814 --> 29:28.782
and, of course, the hardest to find...

29:28.817 --> 29:31.384
is magic from a witch

29:31.487 --> 29:34.112
who crushed the heart of
the thing she loves most.

29:35.672 --> 29:37.362
So...

29:38.293 --> 29:39.980
Regina.

29:41.287 --> 29:42.687
What'll it be?

29:44.199 --> 29:46.433
My curse...

29:49.526 --> 29:51.058
Hey.

29:51.396 --> 29:52.472
Or his life?

29:59.134 --> 30:00.480
I don't understand.

30:00.582 --> 30:02.115
How does this help that girl?

30:02.217 --> 30:04.284
It's a spell,

30:04.309 --> 30:07.277
but it can only activate
if it's imbued with magic,

30:07.422 --> 30:10.690
and, in this land, you're
the only one who has it.

30:10.792 --> 30:12.692
I am?

30:12.794 --> 30:14.461
But what about...

30:16.598 --> 30:20.167
Ana? What's wrong, sweetheart?

30:20.823 --> 30:22.622
Someone's here.

30:23.964 --> 30:25.169
It's her.

30:28.082 --> 30:30.510
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

30:30.612 --> 30:33.113
What's going on?

30:33.215 --> 30:35.020
She's losing control.

30:35.098 --> 30:38.018
Anastasia, look at me.

30:38.043 --> 30:40.110
You have to calm down.

30:45.260 --> 30:47.494
Hello, Ana.

31:09.051 --> 31:12.018
Ana! Oh, thank God.

31:14.397 --> 31:16.797
Drizella, is that you?

31:16.822 --> 31:19.593
I know. I grew up,
but I promise it's me.

31:19.695 --> 31:21.394
Mom called me. She told
me what was going on.

31:21.496 --> 31:22.829
I-I brought something to help.

31:22.931 --> 31:25.479
These will dampen your magic.

31:25.619 --> 31:26.833
Can I?

31:32.269 --> 31:33.340
Does that feel better?

31:33.442 --> 31:35.108
Yeah, I think so.

31:35.210 --> 31:36.810
But, Drizella, the witch is in there.

31:36.912 --> 31:37.944
She's after me.

31:38.046 --> 31:39.012
It's okay. It's okay.

31:39.114 --> 31:40.313
I'm here to help. Just come with me.

31:40.415 --> 31:41.781
I'll keep you safe, all right?

31:41.806 --> 31:44.150
I won't let anything happen to you.

31:53.870 --> 31:55.536
Ella.

31:55.605 --> 31:56.570
Henry.

31:56.639 --> 31:58.072
I'm so, so, sorry.

31:59.438 --> 32:01.338
We have to do something.

32:02.170 --> 32:05.660
There's nothing you can
do except cast the curse.

32:12.026 --> 32:13.258
Fine. I'll do it.

32:13.283 --> 32:15.181
- No, no, no!
- Regina.

32:15.284 --> 32:17.050
Zelena, move.

32:17.119 --> 32:18.818
This is not what he wants.

32:18.920 --> 32:20.820
Wouldn't you do it for Robin?

32:21.625 --> 32:23.499
I would for Alice.

32:24.926 --> 32:26.530
Let her do it, Zelena.

32:33.902 --> 32:35.201
All right.

32:37.486 --> 32:39.219
Let's do this.

32:44.124 --> 32:46.214
But know one thing.

32:46.335 --> 32:48.981
It is not over.

32:55.807 --> 32:58.073
Okay. Henry.

33:25.819 --> 33:26.920
Is this it?

33:29.291 --> 33:30.716
Take this.

33:31.570 --> 33:33.912
I've put Mr. Gold in a room...

33:33.937 --> 33:35.770
in my mind.

33:35.904 --> 33:38.769
This is the key.

33:38.794 --> 33:41.448
Get it to me, and it'll open.

33:41.831 --> 33:45.174
If it doesn't, you know
what you have to do.

33:45.199 --> 33:46.698
Alice.

33:49.361 --> 33:50.561
I got your letter.

33:50.663 --> 33:52.096
You came.

33:52.164 --> 33:53.931
Of course I came.

34:03.166 --> 34:05.133
I just had to see your
face one last time.

34:05.235 --> 34:08.202
No, no, not the last.

34:08.304 --> 34:10.177
We'll always know each other.

34:10.318 --> 34:12.005
Even if we don't.

34:13.877 --> 34:15.275
Oh.

34:33.250 --> 34:36.630
In this land, what's
going to happen to Lucy?

34:36.733 --> 34:38.600
She's just a kid.

34:38.702 --> 34:41.664
How will I find her if I
don't even know she exists?

34:45.858 --> 34:47.757
With this.

34:51.313 --> 34:53.481
You'll know.

35:36.493 --> 35:38.993
"Every curse can be broken.

35:39.460 --> 35:41.493
You just need belief,

35:42.459 --> 35:45.107
maybe the help of your family.

35:46.202 --> 35:48.670
It took time, but Emma learned that.

35:48.738 --> 35:50.438
And when she did, she
knew she could believe

35:50.540 --> 35:53.841
in anything if it would
save her child's life."

35:53.943 --> 35:55.938
Now I get it.

35:57.147 --> 35:59.414
I really get it.

36:00.055 --> 36:02.950
Because I would do anything to save you,

36:03.019 --> 36:04.852
no matter how crazy.

36:07.257 --> 36:09.023
So, Lucy, if that means
there's some other world

36:09.125 --> 36:11.478
where I really am your dad, then...

36:12.762 --> 36:15.863
I believe it, Lucy.

36:18.092 --> 36:20.192
I believe.

37:06.182 --> 37:08.082
That was Henry.

37:08.184 --> 37:09.350
Lucy's no better.

37:12.021 --> 37:13.888
Well, tell him to try True Love's Kiss.

37:13.990 --> 37:16.224
He already did.

37:16.292 --> 37:17.625
Belfrey must have done the one thing

37:17.694 --> 37:20.461
she's been trying to do for years...

37:20.530 --> 37:23.164
She took Lucy's belief.

37:23.233 --> 37:26.467
It doesn't work unless both
of you believe in True Love.

37:26.536 --> 37:29.114
So, if we want to help Lucy...

37:30.940 --> 37:33.941
we both have to get our magic back.

37:34.043 --> 37:36.410
And there's only one way to do that.

37:42.549 --> 37:44.516
Break the curse.

37:45.955 --> 37:51.159
But if we do that, Henry dies.

37:51.261 --> 37:56.964
And if we don't, Lucy does.

38:12.515 --> 38:13.815
Where are we?

38:15.218 --> 38:16.617
In a gathering place...

38:18.121 --> 38:20.288
for me and my family.

38:21.424 --> 38:22.757
What is she doing here?

38:26.396 --> 38:27.728
What's going on, Drizella?

38:27.831 --> 38:29.964
What's going on

38:30.066 --> 38:32.524
is I'm sick of living in your shadow,

38:32.751 --> 38:35.269
so I'm going to steal your magic

38:35.371 --> 38:38.539
like you have stolen everything from me.

38:43.479 --> 38:45.112
What are you doing? Let go.

38:45.215 --> 38:46.447
I can't!

38:56.359 --> 38:58.860
What the hell just happened?

38:58.962 --> 39:01.329
Exactly what I planned.

39:01.431 --> 39:05.700
I didn't use that vine
to give her magic to you.

39:05.802 --> 39:09.403
I used that vine to
give your magic to her.

39:13.243 --> 39:15.509
You betrayed me.

39:15.578 --> 39:18.346
Well, you should have
listened to your mother, then.

39:24.944 --> 39:26.043
Aah!

39:36.796 --> 39:38.663
Don't even look at me.

39:39.083 --> 39:41.602
No. No!

39:44.073 --> 39:46.007
Oh, it's all upside-down.

39:46.109 --> 39:47.708
Weaver?

39:47.810 --> 39:49.810
Yeah, I'm over here.

39:49.913 --> 39:51.512
What the hell happened?

39:51.614 --> 39:52.680
And don't tell me you'd explain,

39:52.782 --> 39:54.289
but I wouldn't believe it anyway.

39:54.570 --> 39:56.550
Honestly, Detective,

39:56.653 --> 39:58.406
I don't quite believe it myself.

39:58.431 --> 40:00.755
Well, there's something
else you won't believe.

40:00.857 --> 40:03.424
Tilly and I found
something over by the troll.

40:03.526 --> 40:05.126
There's a symbol painted there.

40:05.228 --> 40:06.327
Let me guess.

40:06.429 --> 40:08.596
Did it look like this?

40:08.698 --> 40:10.698
Yeah.

40:10.800 --> 40:12.199
It's the symbol from Eloise's notebook.

40:12.302 --> 40:14.435
What the devil does it mean?

40:14.460 --> 40:16.178
It means...

40:17.974 --> 40:19.774
they're here.

41:02.500 --> 41:05.045
They're beautiful, aren't they?

41:09.194 --> 41:11.102
Who do these belong to?

41:11.876 --> 41:15.244
Right now, they belong to the darkness.

41:17.029 --> 41:20.501
But soon, we'll find the women
who were meant to wear them.

41:21.435 --> 41:23.170
Our sisters.

41:23.647 --> 41:26.467
And then the Coven of
the Eight will be joined.
