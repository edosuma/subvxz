WEBVTT

00:02.051 --> 00:03.085
>> ANDRE: I'm all for a good

00:03.085 --> 00:04.219
laugh when it's at my expense.

00:04.219 --> 00:05.621
But not my cat!

00:05.621 --> 00:06.822
What kind of animal humiliates

00:06.822 --> 00:07.823
another animal?

00:07.823 --> 00:08.824
It's not funny, all right?

00:08.824 --> 00:09.825
I had to send Milady to

00:09.825 --> 00:10.826
a cat spa!

00:10.826 --> 00:11.827
Hopefully when she comes back

00:11.827 --> 00:12.828
in a week, she'll be normal

00:12.828 --> 00:13.829
again.

00:13.829 --> 00:14.830
>> RUXIN: That was an epic cat

00:14.830 --> 00:15.831
prank, Pete.

00:15.831 --> 00:16.832
>> PETE: Thank you.

00:16.832 --> 00:17.833
>> You know it went viral in

00:17.833 --> 00:18.834
Korea?

00:18.834 --> 00:19.835
>> I'm very proud of it, but I

00:19.835 --> 00:20.836
have to say Jenny's prank was

00:20.836 --> 00:22.104
number one this weekend.

00:22.104 --> 00:23.105
I mean, her poopsicle really

00:23.105 --> 00:24.106
took the cake.

00:24.106 --> 00:25.107
>> Classic.

00:25.107 --> 00:26.108
>> Which is why I am changing my

00:26.108 --> 00:28.077
team name to The Shit Heads.

00:28.077 --> 00:29.078
>> KEVIN: You can't use that

00:29.078 --> 00:30.079
picture and you can't use that

00:30.079 --> 00:31.080
name!

00:31.080 --> 00:32.081
That name's offensive.

00:32.081 --> 00:33.082
>> You can't control my team

00:33.082 --> 00:34.049
name.

00:34.049 --> 00:35.050
>> Well, I can control the

00:35.050 --> 00:36.051
standings page and the

00:36.051 --> 00:37.052
transaction page.

00:37.052 --> 00:38.053
I could just "Phil Simms" it

00:38.053 --> 00:39.054
and-and call it Pete's Team.

00:39.054 --> 00:40.322
>> Wow. We got a real Redskins

00:40.322 --> 00:41.624
situation happening.

00:41.624 --> 00:42.625
>> Yeah, Jenny and I won't

00:42.625 --> 00:43.626
stand for it.

00:43.626 --> 00:45.194
We will not be part of using a

00:45.194 --> 00:46.362
name that a cross-section of our

00:46.362 --> 00:47.730
league finds offensive.

00:47.730 --> 00:48.731
>> Okay, this is not inherently

00:48.731 --> 00:49.732
offensive.

00:49.732 --> 00:50.733
I am celebrating the grand

00:50.733 --> 00:51.734
tradition of Jenny's bowels.

00:51.734 --> 00:52.735
>> Well, Jenny and I don't want

00:52.735 --> 00:53.736
you to use that name.

00:53.736 --> 00:54.737
>> You got a lot of sand

00:54.737 --> 00:55.738
up in the vag today, bud.

00:55.738 --> 00:56.739
What's going on?

00:56.739 --> 00:57.740
>> I just don't need this Shit

00:57.740 --> 00:59.241
Head thing in my life... and my

00:59.241 --> 01:00.476
father-in-law's in town for a

01:00.476 --> 01:01.677
night, so...

01:01.677 --> 01:02.678
>> Bruce!

01:02.678 --> 01:03.679
>> Bruce Banger!

01:03.679 --> 01:04.680
>> Bang! Bang! Bang!

01:04.680 --> 01:05.681
>> TACO: Bruce Banger!

01:05.681 --> 01:07.216
>> Bruce Banger, the man's man.

01:07.216 --> 01:08.684
Constantly emasculating me in my

01:08.684 --> 01:09.818
own home.

01:09.818 --> 01:10.819
>> Oh, come on, how can you be

01:10.819 --> 01:11.820
more emasculated than you are

01:11.820 --> 01:12.821
right now?

01:12.821 --> 01:13.822
>> Yeah, you got a broke dick,

01:13.822 --> 01:15.057
your wife's the champion and she

01:15.057 --> 01:16.091
literally shit on your face.

01:16.091 --> 01:17.092
>> Oh, you mean this?

01:17.092 --> 01:18.093
Is that shit on your face?

01:18.093 --> 01:19.094
Oh, my God!

01:19.094 --> 01:20.095
>> Thank goodness, unlike you

01:20.095 --> 01:21.096
guys, I only have to put up with

01:21.096 --> 01:22.097
Bruce for one night.

01:22.097 --> 01:22.631
>> Where's he going?

01:22.631 --> 01:23.632
>> Then he's off to DeKalb

01:23.632 --> 01:24.633
county to his property he calls

01:24.633 --> 01:25.634
Manland.

01:25.634 --> 01:26.635
>> "Manland"?

01:26.635 --> 01:27.636
>> Mm-hmm.

01:27.636 --> 01:28.637
>> Sounds like a gay amusement

01:28.637 --> 01:29.638
park.

01:29.638 --> 01:30.739
>> Oh, God, this Pinot Grigio is

01:30.739 --> 01:32.374
swill.

01:32.374 --> 01:33.375
I'm gonna get another drink.

01:33.375 --> 01:34.376
Anyone want anything?

01:34.376 --> 01:35.377
>> Yeah, I'll take one.

01:35.377 --> 01:36.378
>> Hold on, let me get this

01:36.378 --> 01:37.513
round.

01:37.513 --> 01:39.214
Okay. There you go.

01:39.214 --> 01:41.817
>> Thank you.

01:41.817 --> 01:43.185
>> What are you doing?

01:43.185 --> 01:44.186
>> Why are you throwing your

01:44.186 --> 01:45.187
money on the floor?

01:45.187 --> 01:46.188
>> I read an article in the <i>NY</i>

01:46.188 --> 01:47.189
<i>Times</i> that said they're

01:47.189 --> 01:48.190
probably gonna get rid of the

01:48.190 --> 01:49.291
penny, so the rest of the coins

01:49.291 --> 01:50.292
are probably not far behind.

01:50.292 --> 01:51.293
I don't want to be the last

01:51.293 --> 01:52.294
person on my block carrying

01:52.294 --> 01:52.828
around that garbage.

01:52.828 --> 01:53.829
>> If you're gonna throw your

01:53.829 --> 01:54.830
change away, can you give it to

01:54.830 --> 01:55.831
me?

01:55.831 --> 01:56.832
>> I appreciate that, brother,

01:56.832 --> 01:57.566
but it's my problem.

01:57.566 --> 01:58.567
I'll deal with it.

01:58.567 --> 01:59.568
>> Excuse me, barkeep?

01:59.568 --> 02:00.569
>> Hey, what's up, man?

02:00.569 --> 02:01.570
>> Hey, dude, what's going on?

02:01.570 --> 02:02.304
>> How you doing?

02:02.304 --> 02:04.306
Going to get some wine, right?

02:04.306 --> 02:05.307
>> Oh, yes...

02:05.307 --> 02:06.308
>> What can I get you, fellas?

02:06.308 --> 02:07.309
>> Well, it's about 54 degrees,

02:07.309 --> 02:08.310
the leaves are falling, it's

02:08.310 --> 02:09.545
sort of a low pressure system.

02:09.545 --> 02:11.313
I would like a malbec.

02:11.313 --> 02:12.314
>> Great choice.

02:12.314 --> 02:13.682
Two malbecs, please.

02:13.682 --> 02:14.717
>> Something from the Mendoza

02:14.717 --> 02:16.318
Valley, 2011 or earlier if you

02:16.318 --> 02:17.453
have it.

02:17.453 --> 02:18.454
>> We have a red.

02:18.454 --> 02:19.488
(both laugh)

02:19.488 --> 02:20.522
>> What kind of red?

02:20.522 --> 02:22.091
>> A cabriolet sauvignon.

02:22.091 --> 02:23.092
(both laugh)

02:23.092 --> 02:24.093
>> I'm sorry.

02:24.093 --> 02:25.094
>> <i>Pardonnez-moi.</i>

02:25.094 --> 02:26.095
>> Just read the label

02:26.095 --> 02:27.096
one more time.

02:27.096 --> 02:28.097
>> Cabriolet sauvignon.

02:28.097 --> 02:29.098
>> That's what I thought he

02:29.098 --> 02:30.099
said.

02:30.099 --> 02:31.100
>> "Cabriolet sauvignon."

02:31.100 --> 02:32.101
I want to drink it, not drive

02:32.101 --> 02:33.102
it.

02:33.102 --> 02:34.103
>> You know what?

02:34.103 --> 02:35.104
I'm not gonna serve you guys.

02:35.104 --> 02:36.105
>> What?

02:36.105 --> 02:37.106
>> We're trying to teach you

02:37.106 --> 02:38.173
about wine through dry humor.

02:38.173 --> 02:39.174
>> Yeah, like the British

02:39.174 --> 02:40.175
<i>Office.</i>

02:40.175 --> 02:41.176
>> You guys can get out now.

02:41.176 --> 02:42.177
>> We're not gonna go, okay?

02:42.177 --> 02:43.178
I just...

02:43.178 --> 02:44.379
>> No, no. Andre, it's fine.

02:44.379 --> 02:45.714
We're gonna go someplace better.

02:45.714 --> 02:46.815
>> Where?

02:46.815 --> 02:47.816
>> I have an idea I've been

02:47.816 --> 02:49.351
meaning to talk to you about.

02:49.351 --> 02:50.352
>> You know what?

02:50.352 --> 02:51.553
This place sucks.

02:51.553 --> 02:53.222
That's why we are gonna open a

02:53.222 --> 02:55.124
wine bar!

02:55.124 --> 02:56.191
>> Don't say it like that.

02:56.191 --> 02:57.292
It's a wine bar.

02:57.292 --> 02:58.293
>> Hey! I said get out!

02:58.293 --> 02:59.294
>> We will not have rude

02:59.294 --> 03:00.295
employees like this at our wine

03:00.295 --> 03:01.296
bar.

03:01.296 --> 03:02.297
>> Get out!

03:02.297 --> 03:03.365
>> So, for anyone who wants a

03:03.365 --> 03:04.700
glass of Riesling, come to my

03:04.700 --> 03:06.635
brand-new wine bar!

03:06.635 --> 03:07.636
>> We'll be open in a couple of

03:07.636 --> 03:08.637
months hopefully.

03:08.637 --> 03:09.638
>> Hey!

03:09.638 --> 03:10.639
>> Okay, yes.

03:10.639 --> 03:11.507
>> You guys with them?

03:11.507 --> 03:12.207
>> No.

03:12.207 --> 03:12.708
>> No.

03:12.708 --> 03:13.408
>> What a couple of assholes.

03:13.408 --> 03:14.109
>> Oh, yeah, yeah.

03:14.109 --> 03:14.610
>> Yeah.

03:14.610 --> 03:16.578
>> Yeah.

03:22.284 --> 03:23.318
(grunting)

03:23.318 --> 03:24.319
>> It's probably hard to twist

03:24.319 --> 03:25.320
it.

03:25.320 --> 03:26.321
>> JENNY: How's it going, Daddy?

03:26.321 --> 03:27.356
>> Oh, we almost got it.

03:27.356 --> 03:28.423
>> No more leak.

03:28.423 --> 03:29.691
Pipe's as good as mine.

03:29.691 --> 03:31.393
>> Oh! We did it! We did it!

03:31.393 --> 03:32.394
>> Yeah, you did.

03:32.394 --> 03:33.395
He's my little flashlight

03:33.395 --> 03:34.396
holder.

03:34.396 --> 03:35.397
>> Really? That used to be my

03:35.397 --> 03:36.431
job when I was little.

03:36.431 --> 03:37.466
>> How's that boo-boo?

03:37.466 --> 03:38.534
>> It's really deep.

03:38.534 --> 03:39.601
I might not be able to hold a

03:39.601 --> 03:41.103
pen for a week.

03:41.103 --> 03:41.837
>> Ah, thank you so much

03:41.837 --> 03:42.538
for doing all this.

03:42.538 --> 03:43.772
>> Anything for my little

03:43.772 --> 03:44.773
Peanut!

03:44.773 --> 03:45.774
>> Oh, you're so good to me.

03:45.774 --> 03:46.775
>> Now you know what it's like

03:46.775 --> 03:47.776
to have a man around the house,

03:47.776 --> 03:48.777
huh?

03:48.777 --> 03:49.778
>> Stop it!

03:49.778 --> 03:50.779
>> Uh, I'm sorry I'm not the

03:50.779 --> 03:51.780
Marlboro Man, but I do things

03:51.780 --> 03:52.781
around my house.

03:52.781 --> 03:53.782
>> What do you do?

03:53.782 --> 03:54.750
>> Specifically what do I do?

03:54.750 --> 03:55.751
>> What do you do?

03:55.751 --> 03:56.752
>> What do you do?

03:56.752 --> 03:57.753
>> Well, who do you think resets

03:57.753 --> 03:58.754
the router?

03:58.754 --> 03:59.755
You think that just magically

03:59.755 --> 04:00.756
happens and everyone gets the

04:00.756 --> 04:01.757
Wi-Fi? No!

04:01.757 --> 04:02.758
Someone's got to pull the plug

04:02.758 --> 04:03.759
out the back, wait the ten

04:03.759 --> 04:04.760
seconds and then put it back in.

04:04.760 --> 04:05.761
I do that once a month!

04:05.761 --> 04:06.762
>> Stop! What the (bleep) is a

04:06.762 --> 04:07.763
router?

04:07.763 --> 04:08.530
>> It's for the computer.

04:08.530 --> 04:09.531
>> Oh, that's a ninny thing.

04:09.531 --> 04:10.532
>> It's not a ninny thing.

04:10.532 --> 04:11.533
>> It's a ninny thing.

04:11.533 --> 04:12.534
>> Bruce, it is not a ninny...

04:12.534 --> 04:13.535
Ow! Ow! Ow!

04:13.535 --> 04:14.536
Bruce! Bruce! Bruce!

04:14.536 --> 04:15.537
>> Say, "I'm a ninny."

04:15.537 --> 04:16.271
>> No.

04:16.271 --> 04:16.805
>> Say it.

04:16.805 --> 04:17.539
>> No!

04:17.539 --> 04:18.273
>> Say it.

04:18.273 --> 04:18.807
>> No.

04:18.807 --> 04:19.541
>> Say it.

04:19.541 --> 04:20.275
>> No. (squeals quietly)

04:20.275 --> 04:21.276
>> Say, "I'm a ninny."

04:21.276 --> 04:22.277
>> I'm a ninny! I'm a ninny!

04:22.277 --> 04:23.278
Let it go! Let it go! Ow!

04:23.278 --> 04:24.279
I'm not a ninny!

04:24.279 --> 04:25.280
>> Kevin, you're up!

04:25.280 --> 04:26.281
Get in here!

04:26.281 --> 04:27.249
>> I got to go.

04:27.249 --> 04:28.250
>> Ninny.

04:28.250 --> 04:29.751
>> Yeah.

04:29.751 --> 04:31.186
>> Hold it, hold it. All right.

04:31.186 --> 04:32.754
My fifth pick in the

04:32.754 --> 04:34.823
hypothetical mid-season redraft

04:34.823 --> 04:36.792
instead of Ryan Mathews, I

04:36.792 --> 04:38.760
select Knile Davis.

04:38.760 --> 04:40.229
>> Wow!

04:40.229 --> 04:41.230
>> Nice!

04:41.230 --> 04:42.231
>> See? Much better!

04:42.231 --> 04:43.232
>> What the hell is going on

04:43.232 --> 04:44.233
here?

04:44.233 --> 04:45.234
>> Oh, this is our redraft.

04:45.234 --> 04:46.235
We're halfway through the season

04:46.235 --> 04:47.236
so this is where we sort of

04:47.236 --> 04:48.303
hypothetically redraft the

04:48.303 --> 04:49.371
players we should've chosen.

04:49.371 --> 04:50.372
>> It's a theoretical exercise.

04:50.372 --> 04:51.373
Like, wouldn't you rather have

04:51.373 --> 04:53.108
drafted Giovani Bernard than the

04:53.108 --> 04:54.576
currently worthless

04:54.576 --> 04:55.577
Doug Martin?

04:55.577 --> 04:56.678
>> No, no. This is not exercise.

04:56.678 --> 04:58.380
Exercise is done outdoors.

04:58.380 --> 05:00.315
This is ninny behavior.

05:00.315 --> 05:01.750
>> "Ninny behavior"?

05:01.750 --> 05:03.318
Would a ninny open his own wine

05:03.318 --> 05:04.553
bar that sells crepes and

05:04.553 --> 05:05.754
canapés?

05:05.754 --> 05:07.222
>> You tell me, Sinatra.

05:07.222 --> 05:08.223
(laughs)

05:08.223 --> 05:09.224
I'm gonna go sharpen my saws.

05:09.224 --> 05:10.225
>> Okay, Daddy.

05:10.225 --> 05:11.226
>> You know when he said

05:11.226 --> 05:12.227
"Sinatra," he meant Nancy?

05:12.227 --> 05:13.495
>> Well, these shoes were made

05:13.495 --> 05:14.763
for walking and that's just what

05:14.763 --> 05:16.231
they'll do with you, Jenny, when

05:16.231 --> 05:17.633
you take me and Russell out to

05:17.633 --> 05:19.201
find a perfect spot for our wine

05:19.201 --> 05:20.235
bar.

05:20.235 --> 05:21.270
>> Really? You guys are really

05:21.270 --> 05:22.504
going to do this?

05:22.504 --> 05:23.572
>> Yeah, we just figured, you

05:23.572 --> 05:25.107
know, with Russell's expertise

05:25.107 --> 05:26.775
and my je ne sais quoi, we will

05:26.775 --> 05:27.776
make an unbeatable combination.

05:27.776 --> 05:29.111
(phone chirps)

05:29.111 --> 05:30.112
>> I just looked up "je ne sais

05:30.112 --> 05:31.246
quoi" on Google Translate.

05:31.246 --> 05:32.381
Did you know that it means "man

05:32.381 --> 05:33.415
pussy"?

05:33.415 --> 05:34.683
>> That is not what it means.

05:34.683 --> 05:36.151
>> Oh, speaking of Russell, he

05:36.151 --> 05:37.419
sent us a little poll.

05:37.419 --> 05:38.487
Question, everyone.

05:38.487 --> 05:39.488
Which will happen first-- Andre

05:39.488 --> 05:41.390
gets laid or wins The Shiva?

05:41.390 --> 05:42.791
>> Wait, he put that up?

05:42.791 --> 05:43.792
>> I know the answer to that.

05:43.792 --> 05:44.793
>> Whoa, not by his own hand

05:44.793 --> 05:45.794
though.

05:45.794 --> 05:46.795
>> All right, then I'm out.

05:46.795 --> 05:47.796
>> Andre, this is coming from

05:47.796 --> 05:48.797
your business partner.

05:48.797 --> 05:49.798
>> He's... just having fun.

05:49.798 --> 05:50.799
>> All right, back to the draft,

05:50.799 --> 05:51.800
okay?

05:51.800 --> 05:53.101
Instead of the soul-crushing

05:53.101 --> 05:54.102
Dwayne Bowe, I think The Shit

05:54.102 --> 05:55.103
Heads will be taking Brandin

05:55.103 --> 05:56.104
Cooks.

05:56.104 --> 05:57.105
>> Nope, nope.

05:57.105 --> 05:58.106
>> Please stop.

05:58.106 --> 05:59.107
>> We're not saying that name.

05:59.107 --> 06:00.242
>> I, Peter, am offended.

06:00.242 --> 06:01.643
>> You tell them, Jenny Banger.

06:01.643 --> 06:02.644
>> Hey, that is not my name

06:02.644 --> 06:04.179
anymore.

06:04.179 --> 06:06.114
>> ♪ Jenny Banger! ♪

06:06.114 --> 06:07.616
>> Stop it! No, no, no.

06:07.616 --> 06:09.084
>> No, that is not my name!

06:09.084 --> 06:10.585
I am now Jenny MacArthur!

06:10.585 --> 06:12.087
>> Peanut, Peanut, I'm sorry.

06:12.087 --> 06:13.288
Banger was not the greatest name

06:13.288 --> 06:14.489
growing up for a little girl.

06:14.489 --> 06:15.724
>> No, Daddy, it's fine.

06:15.724 --> 06:16.758
>> I swear, the only reason she

06:16.758 --> 06:17.759
married Doris here was to change

06:17.759 --> 06:18.760
her last name.

06:18.760 --> 06:19.761
(laughter)

06:19.761 --> 06:20.829
>> You know what, Bruce, I am

06:20.829 --> 06:22.364
sick and tired of you

06:22.364 --> 06:23.365
emasculating me in my own home.

06:23.365 --> 06:24.366
All right?

06:24.366 --> 06:25.367
>> Whoa, Kevin...

06:25.367 --> 06:26.368
>> I am just as much of a man as

06:26.368 --> 06:27.369
you are.

06:27.369 --> 06:28.370
>> Oh, you are, are you?

06:28.370 --> 06:29.371
>> Yeah, I am.

06:29.371 --> 06:30.372
>> Prove it.

06:30.372 --> 06:31.373
>> How?

06:31.373 --> 06:32.374
>> Come hunting with me.

06:32.374 --> 06:33.408
>> That's great idea.

06:33.408 --> 06:34.543
>> Where, Manland?

06:34.543 --> 06:35.711
>> (laughs): Yeah, why don't you

06:35.711 --> 06:37.412
and your gal pals here log out

06:37.412 --> 06:39.348
of the Matrix and join me in the

06:39.348 --> 06:40.615
real world for a couple of days.

06:40.615 --> 06:41.583
>> Fine.

06:41.583 --> 06:42.584
>> Yeah?

06:42.584 --> 06:43.585
>> Fine, we'll go to Manland

06:43.585 --> 06:44.586
with you.

06:44.586 --> 06:45.587
>> I'm sorry. What?

06:45.587 --> 06:46.588
>> I mean, I would go, but my

06:46.588 --> 06:47.589
cat's coming back from the spa

06:47.589 --> 06:48.590
this week and I'm getting these

06:48.590 --> 06:49.324
nosebleeds.

06:49.324 --> 06:50.325
It's like I'm bleeding once a

06:50.325 --> 06:51.326
month.

06:51.326 --> 06:52.327
>> You know what, Andre?

06:52.327 --> 06:53.328
You're not helping, okay?

06:53.328 --> 06:54.329
We're all in for Manland.

06:54.329 --> 06:55.330
>> Good.

06:55.330 --> 06:56.331
Lace up your boots, Suzy.

06:56.331 --> 06:57.232
>> Consider them laced.

06:57.232 --> 06:59.368
Ow! Ow!

07:05.925 --> 07:07.593
>> Welcome to Manland!

07:07.593 --> 07:08.594
>> This sucks.

07:08.594 --> 07:09.829
>> Where are all the men?

07:09.829 --> 07:10.830
>> Come on, come on, come on!

07:10.830 --> 07:11.964
Let's hit it, ladies!

07:11.964 --> 07:12.998
>> Hit what? What do you

07:12.998 --> 07:13.999
actually do out here?

07:13.999 --> 07:14.967
>> Anything we want.

07:14.967 --> 07:15.701
That's the beauty of Manland.

07:15.701 --> 07:16.235
(gunshot)

07:16.235 --> 07:17.236
(screams)

07:17.236 --> 07:18.571
Relax, Renee.

07:18.571 --> 07:19.605
>> It's not "Renee," Bruce.

07:19.605 --> 07:20.606
It's Kevin.

07:20.606 --> 07:21.607
>> Not out here, it ain't.

07:21.607 --> 07:22.908
Let's go-- we got snakes, we got

07:22.908 --> 07:24.043
wolves, we got 32 kinds of

07:24.043 --> 07:25.978
spiders, mountain lions

07:25.978 --> 07:26.946
and a bear!

07:26.946 --> 07:28.647
>> More change?

07:28.647 --> 07:30.616
Get rid of this junk.

07:35.187 --> 07:37.723
>> Couple more miles to camp.

07:37.723 --> 07:39.258
>> Taco, I'm serious.

07:39.258 --> 07:40.259
Do not fire that gun.

07:40.259 --> 07:41.560
>> Don't worry.

07:41.560 --> 07:42.828
Gun safety 101.

07:42.828 --> 07:43.829
A gun should never go off unless

07:43.829 --> 07:44.830
it's by accident.

07:44.830 --> 07:45.831
>> Hey, Ruxin, why don't you

07:45.831 --> 07:46.832
lead?

07:46.832 --> 07:47.833
You were in the Boy Scouts.

07:47.833 --> 07:48.801
>> So were you.

07:48.801 --> 07:49.802
>> No, I was in the Cub Scouts,

07:49.802 --> 07:50.803
okay?

07:50.803 --> 07:51.804
When I found out the next level

07:51.804 --> 07:52.938
was called "Webelo" I bailed.

07:52.938 --> 07:53.939
You stayed in until you were

07:53.939 --> 07:54.940
like 19.

07:54.940 --> 07:55.941
>> 18 and it was just for my

07:55.941 --> 07:57.042
college application.

07:57.042 --> 07:57.910
>> Ruxin, what was the toughest

07:57.910 --> 07:59.245
badge to get, holding it till

07:59.245 --> 08:00.112
you got out of the woods?

08:00.112 --> 08:01.013
>> Ah... no, it was American

08:01.013 --> 08:02.081
culture, and I can tie knots

08:02.081 --> 08:03.215
like a mofo.

08:03.215 --> 08:04.717
>> Did I just hear that you were

08:04.717 --> 08:05.651
a Boy Scout?

08:05.651 --> 08:06.685
>> Yeah.

08:06.685 --> 08:07.987
>> You are up front with me.

08:07.987 --> 08:08.854
(slap)

08:08.854 --> 08:09.955
>> Oh... that brought back a lot

08:09.955 --> 08:10.923
of memories.

08:10.923 --> 08:13.158
>> I was a Scout Leader.

08:13.158 --> 08:14.760
I shaped a lot of boys with

08:14.760 --> 08:15.794
these hands.

08:15.794 --> 08:16.896
>> I bet you did.

08:16.896 --> 08:17.763
(rustling)

08:17.763 --> 08:18.631
(Kevin screaming)

08:18.631 --> 08:19.298
>> What?

08:19.298 --> 08:20.165
>> What's in there?

08:20.165 --> 08:21.033
What's in there?

08:21.033 --> 08:21.967
Get it, get it, get it, get it!

08:21.967 --> 08:22.968
>> Shh! Quiet.

08:22.968 --> 08:23.969
Back up.

08:23.969 --> 08:25.271
Could be a wild pig.

08:25.271 --> 08:27.072
You girls like bacon?

08:27.072 --> 08:28.040
>> Ho! (laughs)

08:28.040 --> 08:28.741
>> Rafi?

08:28.741 --> 08:29.742
>> Hey!

08:29.742 --> 08:30.743
>> What's up, jerks?

08:30.743 --> 08:31.744
>> Ugh... Rafi.

08:31.744 --> 08:32.678
>> Rafi.

08:32.678 --> 08:33.913
>> What are you doing here?

08:33.913 --> 08:34.847
>> I've been out here for

08:34.847 --> 08:35.614
days, Brian.

08:35.614 --> 08:36.181
I'm tracking you.

08:36.181 --> 08:37.116
>> I told you not to track me.

08:37.116 --> 08:38.617
>> I got to keep you safe, bro.

08:38.617 --> 08:39.685
>> Wait, you're a tracker?

08:39.685 --> 08:40.286
>> Oh, yeah.

08:40.286 --> 08:41.220
>> My kind of man.

08:41.220 --> 08:41.987
Bruce.

08:41.987 --> 08:42.855
>> Rafi.

08:42.855 --> 08:44.156
>> Welcome to Manland.

08:44.156 --> 08:45.257
>> Oh.

08:45.257 --> 08:46.859
Are we not in America anymore?

08:46.859 --> 08:48.127
Awesome.

08:48.127 --> 08:49.128
What's happening, Rux?

08:49.128 --> 08:50.062
>> Eat shit, Rafi.

08:50.062 --> 08:50.930
>> Already did, bro.

08:50.930 --> 08:53.065
Second harvest-- delicious.

08:53.065 --> 08:54.967
>> Only knot I remember is the

08:54.967 --> 08:56.201
Windsor knot.

08:56.201 --> 08:57.202
>> According to Scout's Law, a

08:57.202 --> 08:58.837
Scout is trustworthy, loyal,

08:58.837 --> 09:00.239
helpful, friendly, courteous,

09:00.239 --> 09:01.974
kind, obedient, cheerful,

09:01.974 --> 09:03.842
thrifty, brave, clean and

09:03.842 --> 09:04.810
reverent.

09:04.810 --> 09:05.578
You are none of those things,

09:05.578 --> 09:06.111
Ruxin.

09:06.111 --> 09:07.012
>> I am clean.

09:07.012 --> 09:07.980
>> Not on the inside.

09:07.980 --> 09:09.114
Taco, how's the fire?

09:09.114 --> 09:10.115
>> The outdoor bong's coming

09:10.115 --> 09:11.216
along great.

09:11.216 --> 09:12.084
>> Nice.

09:12.084 --> 09:12.985
>> I can't get a cell signal

09:12.985 --> 09:13.886
anywhere.

09:13.886 --> 09:14.753
I mean, it's like there's no

09:14.753 --> 09:15.688
coverage out here at all.

09:15.688 --> 09:16.889
>> Exactly. That is the beauty

09:16.889 --> 09:18.257
of the great outdoors.

09:18.257 --> 09:19.925
No cell!

09:19.925 --> 09:22.061
No Internet!

09:22.061 --> 09:23.295
No routers.

09:23.295 --> 09:24.597
>> Forget Korea.

09:24.597 --> 09:25.731
This is worse than North Korea.

09:25.731 --> 09:26.765
>> The games are tomorrow.

09:26.765 --> 09:27.866
We gotta set our lineups.

09:27.866 --> 09:28.801
>> Yeah, I need to line up my

09:28.801 --> 09:29.668
Shit Heads.

09:29.668 --> 09:30.569
>> Hey, what did I tell you

09:30.569 --> 09:31.604
about that? It is offensive.

09:31.604 --> 09:32.705
>> Would you stop being such a

09:32.705 --> 09:33.739
skin-thin ninny?

09:33.739 --> 09:34.907
Prove it to me-- prove to me

09:34.907 --> 09:36.508
that you were not born with a

09:36.508 --> 09:37.710
cheetah parlor down there.

09:37.710 --> 09:39.778
>> I have a penis, Bruce, okay?

09:39.778 --> 09:41.280
And I've used it...

09:41.280 --> 09:42.681
in-in your daughter.

09:42.681 --> 09:43.949
>> (chuckles) Not lately.

09:43.949 --> 09:46.185
>> Gentlemen, dinner is served.

09:46.185 --> 09:47.853
About one klick that way, I

09:47.853 --> 09:49.855
found a huge pile of bear shit.

09:49.855 --> 09:51.523
Picked through that, found

09:51.523 --> 09:52.725
some pretty good nuggies.

09:52.725 --> 09:53.859
Brian, can I interest you in

09:53.859 --> 09:54.760
some second harvest?

09:54.760 --> 09:55.594
>> No.

09:55.594 --> 09:56.261
>> It's delicious.

09:56.261 --> 09:57.162
>> No, no, I don't want bear

09:57.162 --> 09:58.597
poop; I want real food and

09:58.597 --> 09:59.565
cell service.

09:59.565 --> 10:00.599
Can we go somewhere, please?

10:00.599 --> 10:01.233
>> Yes.

10:01.233 --> 10:01.967
>> Okay, all right, all right,

10:01.967 --> 10:02.901
quiet, Lucy.

10:02.901 --> 10:03.736
I know a bar that's not far

10:03.736 --> 10:04.603
from here.

10:04.603 --> 10:05.537
Tonight I'm gonna take you

10:05.537 --> 10:06.538
there, but then we're gonna come

10:06.538 --> 10:07.272
back here and we're gonna start

10:07.272 --> 10:08.140
acting like men.

10:08.140 --> 10:09.108
>> No, no bar for me.

10:09.108 --> 10:10.209
I've got a real hunting

10:10.209 --> 10:11.243
boner now.

10:11.243 --> 10:12.277
I'm gonna stay right here, I'm

10:12.277 --> 10:13.846
gonna track this bear, I'm gonna

10:13.846 --> 10:15.247
kill it, I'm gonna eat its

10:15.247 --> 10:16.615
heart, I'm gonna gain its

10:16.615 --> 10:18.017
wisdom, and then when you guys

10:18.017 --> 10:19.551
come back, I'm gonna have the

10:19.551 --> 10:20.753
bear meat grilling on the fire.

10:20.753 --> 10:22.121
>> All right, all this talk of

10:22.121 --> 10:23.789
poo, I gotta go drop a log.

10:23.789 --> 10:25.090
>> Oh, put it someplace I can

10:25.090 --> 10:26.525
find it. (laughs)

10:26.525 --> 10:28.060
I'm gonna eat that guy's shit.

10:28.060 --> 10:29.862
>> What?

10:29.862 --> 10:31.864
>> Wait, where are we going?

10:31.864 --> 10:33.232
Ooh, second harvest.

10:33.232 --> 10:34.199
>> Oh, you want a piece?

10:34.199 --> 10:35.668
>> Yeah.

10:35.668 --> 10:37.136
>> It's fresh.

10:37.136 --> 10:38.504
>> Mmm, fancy.

10:38.504 --> 10:39.571
>> So I think it's a real

10:39.571 --> 10:41.073
great find.

10:41.073 --> 10:42.775
You know, it needs some work.

10:42.775 --> 10:44.076
>> But look at all this space.

10:44.076 --> 10:45.077
>> Yeah.

10:45.077 --> 10:46.045
>> I love the textures.

10:46.045 --> 10:47.279
It's very urban but yet

10:47.279 --> 10:48.247
very homey.

10:48.247 --> 10:49.248
>> It's like a canvas that we

10:49.248 --> 10:50.849
can paint upon with wine.

10:50.849 --> 10:52.685
>> It is a little bit more than

10:52.685 --> 10:54.019
you were thinking of spending.

10:54.019 --> 10:55.154
>> But it's worth it.

10:55.154 --> 10:56.088
>> It is.

10:56.088 --> 10:57.589
>> Yes, because a bar is an

10:57.589 --> 10:58.657
investment for the future.

10:58.657 --> 10:59.591
>> Yeah.

10:59.591 --> 11:00.626
>> No one's ever lost money in a

11:00.626 --> 11:01.627
wine bar-- am I right?

11:01.627 --> 11:02.594
>> No, people love to drink

11:02.594 --> 11:03.796
wine, and they hate to drink it

11:03.796 --> 11:04.730
at home.

11:04.730 --> 11:05.664
>> I'm psyched-- I love this

11:05.664 --> 11:06.598
place, I feel like it has

11:06.598 --> 11:07.266
history, and we're gonna

11:07.266 --> 11:08.934
continue its proud tradition.

11:08.934 --> 11:10.703
What was this place before?

11:10.703 --> 11:11.704
>> It was a wine bar.

11:11.704 --> 11:12.805
>> Oh.

11:12.805 --> 11:13.839
>> Oh, good bones.

11:13.839 --> 11:14.840
>> That is true.

11:14.840 --> 11:16.108
>> And it didn't have the name

11:16.108 --> 11:17.242
that is perfection.

11:17.242 --> 11:18.143
>> Oh, you guys have a name

11:18.143 --> 11:19.044
already?

11:19.044 --> 11:20.245
>> Oh, yeah-- Ménage à Cinq.

11:20.245 --> 11:21.580
What do you think?

11:21.580 --> 11:23.248
"Ménage" from "ménage à trois."

11:23.248 --> 11:25.250
>> And <i>cinq</i> like the five noble

11:25.250 --> 11:26.952
grapes of the Bordeaux.

11:26.952 --> 11:28.520
>> So you guys are calling your

11:28.520 --> 11:29.955
bar "The Five-Way."

11:29.955 --> 11:30.956
>> Nothing wrong with a

11:30.956 --> 11:31.890
five-way.

11:31.890 --> 11:32.891
>> But we're saying it in French

11:32.891 --> 11:33.859
so it's classy.

11:33.859 --> 11:34.860
>> If you guys are going to do

11:34.860 --> 11:36.295
this together, I do recommend

11:36.295 --> 11:37.730
you sign some sort of

11:37.730 --> 11:38.997
partnership agreement.

11:38.997 --> 11:40.132
>> Absolutely, yes, let's sign

11:40.132 --> 11:41.533
the paperwork right now.

11:41.533 --> 11:42.267
>> Okay.

11:42.267 --> 11:43.235
>> Ready to be partners.

11:43.235 --> 11:44.636
>> Uh, yes, but one second.

11:44.636 --> 11:45.704
I just want to talk to you for a

11:45.704 --> 11:46.805
second before we, you know, make

11:46.805 --> 11:47.940
this official.

11:47.940 --> 11:48.907
>> Oh, what's up, partner?

11:48.907 --> 11:49.842
>> Just want to make sure we're

11:49.842 --> 11:50.642
on the same page, okay?

11:50.642 --> 11:51.577
>> Yeah.

11:51.577 --> 11:52.277
>> 'Cause here in real life, we

11:52.277 --> 11:53.278
work well together, but on the

11:53.278 --> 11:54.146
fantasy board, you're being so

11:54.146 --> 11:55.214
mean to me there, and I just

11:55.214 --> 11:56.582
want to make sure that, you

11:56.582 --> 11:57.850
know, there's a mutual respect.

11:57.850 --> 11:59.518
>> Look, that's fantasy.

11:59.518 --> 12:00.519
This is reality.

12:00.519 --> 12:01.520
I mean, in real life, do you own

12:01.520 --> 12:02.521
an NFL team?

12:02.521 --> 12:03.522
>> No.

12:03.522 --> 12:04.523
>> No, that's a fantasy.

12:04.523 --> 12:05.524
>> Right.

12:05.524 --> 12:06.525
>> And my polls about you never,

12:06.525 --> 12:07.526
ever getting laid again-- that's

12:07.526 --> 12:08.527
a fantasy, too.

12:08.527 --> 12:09.528
>> It's a fantasy.

12:09.528 --> 12:10.529
>> Right.

12:10.529 --> 12:11.530
To Ménage à Cinq.

12:11.530 --> 12:12.531
>> To Ménage à Cinq.

12:12.531 --> 12:13.532
>> Five grapes, 14 holes.

12:13.532 --> 12:14.533
>> That... we're not gonna...

12:14.533 --> 12:15.501
that won't be the tagline.

12:15.501 --> 12:16.502
>> You got your vaginas, you got

12:16.502 --> 12:17.503
your rear holes...

12:17.503 --> 12:18.504
>> No, I know what the holes

12:18.504 --> 12:19.505
are; it's nothing about holes.

12:19.505 --> 12:20.506
>> Do the math.

12:20.506 --> 12:21.507
>> I got... I have the math.

12:21.507 --> 12:22.274
>> There's 14 holes.

12:22.274 --> 12:24.543
>> Okay.

12:28.655 --> 12:29.656
>> All right, let's go.

12:29.656 --> 12:30.657
>> Please have Wi-Fi.

12:30.657 --> 12:31.658
Please have Wi-Fi.

12:31.658 --> 12:32.659
>> Yeah, no gun.

12:32.659 --> 12:33.660
>> What? But I'm over 18.

12:33.660 --> 12:34.661
>> Put it down.

12:34.661 --> 12:36.963
>> Aw...

12:37.997 --> 12:40.466
>> ♪ When Irish eyes are

12:40.466 --> 12:41.734
smiling... ♪

12:41.734 --> 12:43.102

but no grab-ass if you want to

12:44.404 --> 12:45.171
keep your nuts.

12:45.171 --> 12:46.472
I got to drain it.

12:46.472 --> 12:47.874
>> Ugh. I'm gonna go perform the

12:47.874 --> 12:49.142
ancient rite of tinker-stinker.

12:49.142 --> 12:50.410
I haven't gone to the bathroom

12:50.410 --> 12:51.144
since we left home.

Alfred Morris versus that shitty

13:17.840 --> 13:19.041
I'm starting DeSean Jackson

13:19.041 --> 13:20.910

13:26.716 --> 13:28.517
The Shit Heads and the Redskins

13:28.517 --> 13:29.518
are the same thing.

13:29.518 --> 13:30.052
Same situation.

13:30.052 --> 13:30.786
>> No, they're not.

13:30.786 --> 13:31.520
>> Yes, they are.

13:31.520 --> 13:32.388
>> No.

13:32.388 --> 13:33.022
>> There is no difference

13:33.022 --> 13:33.723
between a Redskin and a

13:33.723 --> 13:34.490
Shit Head-- no difference,

13:34.490 --> 13:35.291
Kevin!

13:35.291 --> 13:35.825
>> Excuse me?

13:35.825 --> 13:36.792
>> I'm just saying how the

13:36.792 --> 13:37.793
Redskins... Oh.

13:37.793 --> 13:39.395
>> I happen to be an American

13:39.395 --> 13:41.297
Indian, and most of us in here

13:41.297 --> 13:43.399
are American Indians, seeing how

13:43.399 --> 13:44.967
the reservation's right down

13:44.967 --> 13:46.651
the road.

13:46.651 --> 13:47.985
Now, what were you saying about

13:47.985 --> 13:49.754
the Potawatomi tribe being a

13:49.754 --> 13:50.888
bunch of shitheads?

13:50.888 --> 13:51.989
>> No, sir, this is just a huge

13:51.989 --> 13:53.057
misunderstanding.

13:53.057 --> 13:54.625
I was using my iPad to set

13:54.625 --> 13:55.593
my lineup.

13:55.593 --> 13:56.561
>> Oh.

13:56.561 --> 13:57.595
The white man's plague, huh?

13:57.595 --> 13:58.629
>> Typhoid?

13:58.629 --> 13:59.997
>> Fantasy football.

13:59.997 --> 14:01.065
>> No, I think it's typhoid.

14:01.065 --> 14:02.366
>> Yeah, it's typhoid.

14:02.366 --> 14:03.668
>> Hey, hey, hey, hey, look, all

14:03.668 --> 14:05.737
these boys said was "Redskins."

14:05.737 --> 14:07.138
Now, last I heard, they're still

14:07.138 --> 14:08.606
a football team in the NFL.

14:08.606 --> 14:10.007
>> Yes, sir, it is.

14:10.007 --> 14:11.609
But I don't like it.

14:11.609 --> 14:12.610
>> Yeah, well, I'm sorry about

14:12.610 --> 14:13.945
that, chief-- but just like

14:13.945 --> 14:14.979
getting your first sniff of tail

14:14.979 --> 14:15.880
in the backseat of a

14:15.880 --> 14:17.615
convertible, it is a tradition.

14:17.615 --> 14:19.016
An American tradition-- if I

14:19.016 --> 14:20.718
am talking about football, I got

14:20.718 --> 14:22.053
a God-given right to say

14:22.053 --> 14:23.588
"Redskins."

14:23.588 --> 14:24.589
>> Whoa.

14:24.589 --> 14:26.824
(patrons murmuring)

14:26.824 --> 14:28.426
>> Gentlemen, gentlemen,

14:28.426 --> 14:29.460
gentlemen, look.

14:29.460 --> 14:30.561
This is a very sensitive issue,

14:30.561 --> 14:31.763
and a little give and take is

14:31.763 --> 14:32.630
natural, unlike the odors

14:32.630 --> 14:33.631
emanating out of your bathroom.

14:33.631 --> 14:34.499
Smells like sickly elk shit

14:34.499 --> 14:35.500
in there.

14:35.500 --> 14:36.033
>> What?

14:36.033 --> 14:36.868
>> Not-not helping.

14:36.868 --> 14:37.668
>> No, no, no...

14:37.668 --> 14:38.536
>> Just trying to paint a

14:38.536 --> 14:39.537
picture here.

14:39.537 --> 14:40.471
>> Don't worry.

14:40.471 --> 14:41.439
We're cool, guys.

14:41.439 --> 14:42.039
Yeah, our trophy's actually a

14:42.039 --> 14:43.141
little Indian girl.

14:43.141 --> 14:44.142
>> What?

14:44.142 --> 14:45.376
>> Yeah, yeah, if you win, you

14:45.376 --> 14:46.377
get to do whatever you want with

14:46.377 --> 14:47.578
her for a full year.

14:47.578 --> 14:48.546
She basically becomes your

14:48.546 --> 14:49.480
property.

14:49.480 --> 14:50.548
I kept her in the closet for a

14:50.548 --> 14:51.616
year 'cause, honestly, I didn't

14:51.616 --> 14:52.483
want to lose her.

14:52.483 --> 14:53.417
>> What the (bleep) happening

14:53.417 --> 14:54.418
here?

14:54.418 --> 14:55.119
>> What are you shitheads

14:55.119 --> 14:56.053
talking about?

14:56.053 --> 14:57.054
>> See, I find that offensive.

14:57.054 --> 14:58.156
>> You know what, I've had

14:58.156 --> 14:59.423
enough of you, Custer.

14:59.423 --> 15:00.158
>> Oh.

15:00.158 --> 15:02.025
>> Okay, uh, we should...

15:02.025 --> 15:02.893
>> Wrap it up.

15:02.893 --> 15:03.427
(gunshot)

15:03.427 --> 15:06.963
(Ruxin gasps)

15:06.963 --> 15:08.265
>> Run! (screams)

15:08.265 --> 15:09.499
>> He pulled a knife!

15:09.499 --> 15:10.634
>> He shot a gun!

15:10.634 --> 15:11.902
>> I clogged both their toilets!

15:11.902 --> 15:12.903
>> Whoa!

15:12.903 --> 15:14.671
>> Go, go, go!

15:14.671 --> 15:16.573
>> Jenny, thanks to you, Ménage

15:16.573 --> 15:18.642
à Cinq will become a reality.

15:18.642 --> 15:20.410
>> I am so glad you're happy.

15:20.410 --> 15:22.045
Honestly, Andre, I had a blast

15:22.045 --> 15:23.146
finding it.

15:23.146 --> 15:24.214
And thank you for this

15:24.214 --> 15:25.115
whole spread.

15:25.115 --> 15:25.916
This was too nice.

15:25.916 --> 15:26.650
You didn't have to do it.

15:26.650 --> 15:27.684
>> Well, I am excited to be with

15:27.684 --> 15:29.086
you because it's been a very

15:29.086 --> 15:30.120
long time since you and I

15:30.120 --> 15:31.221
have talked.

15:31.221 --> 15:32.222
>> Ugh...

15:32.222 --> 15:33.423
>> You know, like, really,

15:33.423 --> 15:35.292
really talk-- like girl talk.

15:35.292 --> 15:36.293
You know, I mean, who says the

15:36.293 --> 15:37.127
hunters have to have all

15:37.127 --> 15:37.928
the fun?

15:37.928 --> 15:38.428
>> Mmm...

15:38.428 --> 15:39.129
(gunshots)

15:39.129 --> 15:39.963
>> We're being shot at by

15:39.963 --> 15:40.964
the Redskins!

15:40.964 --> 15:41.965
>> Offensive!

15:41.965 --> 15:42.966
>> We're being shot at by the

15:42.966 --> 15:43.967
Washingtons!

15:43.967 --> 15:44.968
>> Why are football players

15:44.968 --> 15:46.937
shooting at us?

15:48.271 --> 15:49.272
(panting)

15:49.272 --> 15:50.273
>> Oh, my God.

15:50.273 --> 15:51.274
>> Where are we?

15:51.274 --> 15:52.275
>> I don't know.

15:52.275 --> 15:53.276
>> We don't have any supplies.

15:53.276 --> 15:54.010
>> We can't go back to

15:54.010 --> 15:54.911
the truck.

15:54.911 --> 15:55.679
>> We're gonna die out here.

15:55.679 --> 15:56.580
>> I didn't even get to set my

15:56.580 --> 15:57.381
lineup.

15:57.381 --> 15:58.382
>> I still have my gun, but I

15:58.382 --> 15:59.416
was only able to get out of

15:59.416 --> 16:00.450
there with one beer.

16:00.450 --> 16:01.451
How am I gonna keep my buzz

16:01.451 --> 16:02.452
going?

16:02.452 --> 16:03.286
>> Hey.

16:03.286 --> 16:04.287
(screaming)

16:04.287 --> 16:05.222
Oh, I'm glad you made it out of

16:05.222 --> 16:05.989
there.

16:05.989 --> 16:07.023
Look who I found.

16:07.023 --> 16:08.492
>> Rafi Bomb! What's up?

16:08.492 --> 16:09.693
>> What are you doing, Rafi?

16:09.693 --> 16:11.194
>> Oh, God, since I left you

16:11.194 --> 16:12.562
guys, I was tracking the bear

16:12.562 --> 16:13.563
most of the night.

16:13.563 --> 16:15.232
Didn't get him, but I did find a

16:15.232 --> 16:16.666
big, fresh pile of shit that I

16:16.666 --> 16:18.001
thought I'd second harvest

16:18.001 --> 16:19.002
'cause it was full of Hershey

16:19.002 --> 16:20.070
Kisses.

16:20.070 --> 16:21.071
Spoiler alert, they weren't

16:21.071 --> 16:22.072
Hershey Kisses.

16:22.072 --> 16:23.173
It was just more shit.

16:23.173 --> 16:24.408
I ate it all anyway, got sick to

16:24.408 --> 16:26.510
my tummy, puked, pooped, jerked

16:26.510 --> 16:28.178
off and now I'm here with you

16:28.178 --> 16:29.179
bros.

16:29.179 --> 16:30.580
What have you guys been up to?

16:30.580 --> 16:32.582
(crickets chirping)

16:32.582 --> 16:35.352
>> You and Kevin and Bruce have

16:35.352 --> 16:36.553
a very complicated relationship,

16:36.553 --> 16:38.155
but I get that 'cause I also

16:38.155 --> 16:39.156
have a complicated relationship.

16:39.156 --> 16:40.290
>> Are you talking about your

16:40.290 --> 16:41.291
cat?

16:41.291 --> 16:42.292
>> Yes, thank you for asking.

16:42.292 --> 16:44.261
Milady and I are having a very

16:44.261 --> 16:45.495
rough patch right now.

16:45.495 --> 16:47.130
I think that she feels like I

16:47.130 --> 16:48.198
betrayed her on some level, and

16:48.198 --> 16:49.499
since she's been away, I haven't

16:49.499 --> 16:50.967
heard a thing.

16:50.967 --> 16:52.202
There's supposed to be a camera

16:52.202 --> 16:53.403
in her kennel, but she doesn't

16:53.403 --> 16:54.404
even go in front of it.

16:54.404 --> 16:55.405
I think she's sleeping under it.

16:55.405 --> 16:56.673
She's avoiding me.

16:56.673 --> 16:58.108
>> You know, let's get back to

16:58.108 --> 16:59.676
Ménage à Cinq.

16:59.676 --> 17:00.911
>> But even this I can't even be

17:00.911 --> 17:02.012
excited about because I have my

17:02.012 --> 17:03.013
relationship with Russell.

17:03.013 --> 17:04.014
>> God.

17:04.014 --> 17:05.182
>> I mean, in real life, we are

17:05.182 --> 17:06.483
like this, tight, okay?

17:06.483 --> 17:08.685
But on the fantasy gridiron, he

17:08.685 --> 17:10.120
is so abusive and mean.

17:10.120 --> 17:11.555
It's like, how do you deal with

17:11.555 --> 17:12.489
that?

17:12.489 --> 17:13.957
>> What are you talking, Andre?

17:13.957 --> 17:14.991
That's why we play fantasy

17:14.991 --> 17:16.026
football.

17:16.026 --> 17:17.294
Okay, I threaten to sodomize

17:17.294 --> 17:18.361
Kevin all the time.

17:18.361 --> 17:20.964
I don't actually sodomize Kevin.

17:20.964 --> 17:21.965
>> Even if he asks?

17:21.965 --> 17:22.966
>> What?

17:22.966 --> 17:23.967
>> I mean, if he ever asked you

17:23.967 --> 17:24.601
to, like, you know, put a finger

17:24.601 --> 17:25.335
up there...

17:25.335 --> 17:26.336
>> No, he doesn't ask!

17:26.336 --> 17:27.237
>> You surprise him with it?

17:27.237 --> 17:28.305
>> I'm not talking about this

17:28.305 --> 17:29.306
with you.

17:29.306 --> 17:30.307
>> It is a sexual organ.

17:30.307 --> 17:31.308
>> Stop.

17:31.308 --> 17:32.309
>> Little real talk,

17:32.309 --> 17:33.343
guys like it.

17:33.343 --> 17:34.377
>> Just keep it all

17:34.377 --> 17:35.445
compartmentalized, okay?

17:35.445 --> 17:37.447
Fantasy is one thing,

17:37.447 --> 17:38.482
business is another.

17:38.482 --> 17:39.583
You're fine.

17:39.583 --> 17:40.684
>> You know what?

17:40.684 --> 17:41.685
Russell, I think in the spirit

17:41.685 --> 17:43.153
of being good partners, wants to

17:43.153 --> 17:44.221
do a trade.

17:44.221 --> 17:45.522
He wants me to give him Keenan

17:45.522 --> 17:47.157
Allen and then he's gonna give

17:47.157 --> 17:48.158
me Knowshon Moreno.

17:48.158 --> 17:49.359
What do you think? Good?

17:49.359 --> 17:50.327
>> Yeah, yeah, just take it.

17:50.327 --> 17:51.294
>> Take the trade?

17:51.294 --> 17:52.128
Take the trade, right?

17:52.128 --> 17:52.662
>> Take it.

17:52.662 --> 17:53.396
>> You're the best.

17:53.396 --> 17:54.998
I mean, you know, you and I, we

17:54.998 --> 17:56.032
got stuff to do.

17:56.032 --> 17:57.133
I hope those guys stay out in

17:57.133 --> 17:59.269
the woods for a very long time.

17:59.269 --> 18:01.538
>> All right, we'll hide out

18:01.538 --> 18:04.140
here, find the highway

18:04.140 --> 18:05.141
in the morning.

18:05.141 --> 18:06.409
>> This isn't working.

18:06.409 --> 18:07.944
This iPad is not throwing heat.

18:07.944 --> 18:09.145
>> You want to survive the cold,

18:09.145 --> 18:10.514
here's what you got to do.

18:10.514 --> 18:11.548
Huddle up.

18:11.548 --> 18:13.149
Come on, you and me,

18:13.149 --> 18:14.451
Girl Scout.

18:14.451 --> 18:15.552
>> Brian, you come cuddle with

18:15.552 --> 18:16.686
me.

18:16.686 --> 18:17.687
>> Uh, no, Pete and I are

18:17.687 --> 18:19.089
closer.

18:19.089 --> 18:20.423
>> Taco, you want to cuddle for

18:20.423 --> 18:21.424
warmth?

18:21.424 --> 18:22.459
>> I'm actually really hot.

18:22.459 --> 18:23.460
I'm gonna take this off.

18:23.460 --> 18:25.462
>> Oh, yeah, okay, cool.

18:25.462 --> 18:26.997
I'm hot, too, so I'm just gonna

18:26.997 --> 18:28.231
cuddle with myself, I think.

18:28.231 --> 18:29.399
>> Look, I want you to know, if

18:29.399 --> 18:31.101
we get out here alive, I'm

18:31.101 --> 18:32.903
changing my team name.

18:32.903 --> 18:34.271
>> Thank you, Pete.

18:34.271 --> 18:35.572
>> To The Banging Jenny Bangers.

18:35.572 --> 18:37.073
>> Oh, you know what?

18:37.073 --> 18:38.942
Asshole.

18:38.942 --> 18:40.010
>> Ooh, we got a little lovers'

18:40.010 --> 18:41.044
quarrel.

18:41.044 --> 18:42.412
(chuckles)

18:42.412 --> 18:43.413
>> Stop it, Bruce, okay?

18:43.413 --> 18:45.148
I'm a man who is a little cold

18:45.148 --> 18:46.149
right now.

18:46.149 --> 18:47.284
>> Hey, can I ask you a

18:47.284 --> 18:48.151
question?

18:48.151 --> 18:49.019
>> What?

18:49.019 --> 18:50.020
>> Are you and Tall Guy lovers?

18:50.020 --> 18:51.021
>> No!

18:51.021 --> 18:52.022
>> 'Cause Bruce just said you

18:52.022 --> 18:53.023
were having a lovers' quarrel.

18:53.023 --> 18:54.090
>> Rafi, Bruce is an idiot,

18:54.090 --> 18:55.158
okay? We're not lovers.

18:55.158 --> 18:56.159
He's just making fun of me.

18:56.159 --> 18:56.993
>> Don't let him make fun

18:56.993 --> 18:57.527
of you.

18:57.527 --> 18:58.528
You need to reach deep inside

18:58.528 --> 19:00.030
and let your inner Brian out,

19:00.030 --> 19:02.132
okay, because that guy is scary.

19:02.132 --> 19:03.400
>> You're insane, Rafi.

19:03.400 --> 19:04.568
>> Yeah, sometimes we all got to

19:04.568 --> 19:05.902
be a little insane, Brian, to

19:05.902 --> 19:07.103
get what we want.

19:07.103 --> 19:08.305
Now let's get back down there.

19:08.305 --> 19:09.439
You take your pants off, and

19:09.439 --> 19:10.440
we'll cuddle until you fall

19:10.440 --> 19:11.441
asleep.

19:11.441 --> 19:12.442
>> What? No, no.

19:12.442 --> 19:13.610
I-I'm gonna go take a walk.

19:13.610 --> 19:14.945
>> Do you want a hot mouthful of

19:14.945 --> 19:16.179
not-milk before bed?

19:16.179 --> 19:18.548
>> No, I want to be by myself.

19:18.548 --> 19:20.517
(dings, groaning)

19:26.077 --> 19:27.078
(snoring)

19:27.078 --> 19:29.047
(birds chirping)

19:31.749 --> 19:32.750
>> Wake up.

19:32.750 --> 19:33.751
>> (groaning) What?

19:33.751 --> 19:34.752
>> Time to wake up.

19:34.752 --> 19:37.622
>> Hey, cut it out, man.

19:37.622 --> 19:38.623
(gasps)

19:38.623 --> 19:39.624
What did you do?

19:39.624 --> 19:40.758
>> Did I get my merit badge in

19:40.758 --> 19:41.626
knot tying?

19:41.626 --> 19:42.860
>> You untie me, asshole.

19:42.860 --> 19:44.062
(stammering)

19:44.062 --> 19:45.063
>> Untie yourself, piggy.

19:45.063 --> 19:46.364
>> You are the worst Boy Scout

19:46.364 --> 19:46.898
ever.

19:46.898 --> 19:47.799
>> Yeah, fat little piggy?

19:47.799 --> 19:48.800
>> Oh, you are so dead.

19:48.800 --> 19:49.700
You are so dead.

19:49.700 --> 19:50.535
>> Has anybody seen my ninny

19:50.535 --> 19:51.569
son-in-law?

19:51.569 --> 19:52.670
>> Bear.

19:52.670 --> 19:53.771
>> Ah, no, he's just a big

19:53.771 --> 19:54.806
pussycat.

19:54.806 --> 19:56.607
>> No, look, bear.

19:56.607 --> 19:57.108
Hi.

19:57.108 --> 19:58.776
>> Whoa.

19:58.776 --> 19:59.777
>> Oh, shit.

19:59.777 --> 20:00.778
(growling)

20:00.778 --> 20:03.114
Oh, shit! Bear!

20:03.114 --> 20:05.083
>> Taco, get your gun.

20:05.083 --> 20:06.684
>> Good idea.

20:06.684 --> 20:08.753
(bellowing)

20:08.753 --> 20:10.054
>> (groans) Help!

20:10.054 --> 20:11.055
Untie me!

20:11.055 --> 20:13.524
>> Stand back!

20:16.727 --> 20:18.129
Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm much more

20:18.129 --> 20:19.397
relaxed now.

20:19.397 --> 20:20.398
>> Your gun is a bong?

20:20.398 --> 20:21.466
>> Yeah, it's my forest bong.

20:21.466 --> 20:23.468
>> What the hell are you doing?

20:23.468 --> 20:24.535
>> Taking a picture for my team

20:24.535 --> 20:25.670
page.

20:25.670 --> 20:26.871
>> Oh!

20:26.871 --> 20:28.106
>> Oh, God, oh, we're all

20:28.106 --> 20:29.107
gonna die, and I'm never gonna

20:29.107 --> 20:30.408
see my Laguna beach house.

20:30.408 --> 20:31.109
>> You were never gonna see it,

20:31.109 --> 20:31.909
anyway. You weren't gonna

20:31.909 --> 20:32.677
win the league.

20:32.677 --> 20:33.778
>> I am rock-hard right now!

20:33.778 --> 20:34.545
Anybody else?

20:34.545 --> 20:35.980
(bellowing)

20:35.980 --> 20:36.948
>> Oh, God.

20:36.948 --> 20:37.782
>> All right, everybody, just

20:37.782 --> 20:39.650
back up, slowly back up.

20:39.650 --> 20:42.520
>> Ooh, welcome to Manland.

20:42.520 --> 20:43.387
(bellowing)

20:43.387 --> 20:46.657
(Kevin yelling)

20:46.657 --> 20:47.658
>> Get out of here!

20:47.658 --> 20:48.659
>> Kevin!

20:48.659 --> 20:50.495
(bellowing)

20:50.495 --> 20:52.463
(yelling)

20:54.499 --> 20:56.934
>> Get out of here!

20:56.934 --> 20:58.936
>> It's working!

20:58.936 --> 21:00.938
(continues yelling)

21:00.938 --> 21:02.106
Yes!

21:02.106 --> 21:04.375
>> Get out of here! Go! Go!

21:04.375 --> 21:05.543
>> Yeah!

21:05.543 --> 21:06.544
>> MacArthurs in the mist are

21:06.544 --> 21:07.545
back!

21:07.545 --> 21:08.546
>> Holy shit, what the hell

21:08.546 --> 21:09.514
was that?

21:09.514 --> 21:10.515
>> I'll tell you what that was.

21:10.515 --> 21:12.984
That was his inner Brian.

21:12.984 --> 21:14.418
>> That took cajones, son.

21:14.418 --> 21:15.920
You're all right in my book.

21:15.920 --> 21:16.921
>> Thanks, Bruce.

21:16.921 --> 21:17.855
We should get out of here,

21:17.855 --> 21:18.623
though. Let's go.

21:18.623 --> 21:19.457
>> How are we gonna get out of

21:19.457 --> 21:20.525
here?

21:20.525 --> 21:22.827
>> Uh, I got nothing.

21:22.827 --> 21:23.861
>> Wait, what's with all this

21:23.861 --> 21:24.862
change?

21:24.862 --> 21:25.897
>> Oh, that's me.

21:25.897 --> 21:26.898
I've been dumping it out since

21:26.898 --> 21:27.832
we got here.

21:27.832 --> 21:28.699
I'm almost done.

21:28.699 --> 21:29.534
>> That's it.

21:29.534 --> 21:30.768
We can follow the change trail

21:30.768 --> 21:31.536
right to the highway.

21:31.536 --> 21:32.036
>> Yeah.

21:32.036 --> 21:33.037
>> Let's go, come on.

21:33.037 --> 21:33.838
>> Great idea.

21:33.838 --> 21:34.639
>> Hey, Ruxin, you got to

21:34.639 --> 21:35.139
untie me.

21:35.139 --> 21:36.374
>> Oh, I don't have an untying

21:36.374 --> 21:37.542
badge. Peace!

21:37.542 --> 21:38.576
>> Hey, Rafi, a little help,

21:38.576 --> 21:39.577
please?

21:39.577 --> 21:40.578
>> Sorry, Tall Guy, I got to go

21:40.578 --> 21:42.813
murder that bear with my dick.

21:42.813 --> 21:45.883
>> Run, little bear, run!

21:45.883 --> 21:48.753
>> Oh, thank God it's the road.

21:48.753 --> 21:49.954
Hey, it's a car.

21:49.954 --> 21:52.023
Hey! Stop! Hey! Hey! Help!

21:52.023 --> 21:53.457
>> Thank God.

21:53.457 --> 21:55.660
>> Oh, thank God.

21:55.660 --> 21:56.894
(laughs)

21:56.894 --> 21:57.962
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

21:57.962 --> 21:59.564
Oh, shit.

21:59.564 --> 22:00.565
>> What do you know?

22:00.565 --> 22:01.899
White men lost in the forest.

22:01.899 --> 22:04.535
>> Um, please don't hurt us.

22:04.535 --> 22:05.736
>> Don't worry.

22:05.736 --> 22:06.571
We're not gonna hurt you.

22:06.571 --> 22:07.405
In fact, we're here to give you

22:07.405 --> 22:08.005
a lift.

22:08.005 --> 22:08.739
>> Oh, great.

22:08.739 --> 22:09.740
>> Great.

22:09.740 --> 22:10.741
>> As soon as you drop the

22:10.741 --> 22:11.876
players.

22:11.876 --> 22:12.877
>> From our lineups?

22:12.877 --> 22:14.378
>> Which players?

22:14.378 --> 22:15.546
>> Washington!

22:15.546 --> 22:16.914
>> Oh, no.

22:16.914 --> 22:18.516
>> All right, guys, you sign

22:18.516 --> 22:19.684
this paperwork, and you two are

22:19.684 --> 22:21.018
the proud owners of your very

22:21.018 --> 22:22.920
own wine bar.

22:22.920 --> 22:24.855
>> To Ménage à Cinq.

22:24.855 --> 22:26.023
>> <i>Oui, oui.</i>

22:26.023 --> 22:27.058
>> Now, Andre, are you sure

22:27.058 --> 22:28.392
you're comfortable providing the

22:28.392 --> 22:30.094
capital, the collateral and the

22:30.094 --> 22:31.696
bank loan while Russell is

22:31.696 --> 22:32.763
merely providing...

22:32.763 --> 22:33.598
>> An overall positive attitude

22:33.598 --> 22:34.632
and a keen nose for adventure.

22:34.632 --> 22:35.132
>> Yeah?

22:35.132 --> 22:36.934
>> Yes, I am, because we're

22:36.934 --> 22:38.402
always looking out for each

22:38.402 --> 22:39.070
other.

22:39.070 --> 22:39.937
>> I got your back.

22:39.937 --> 22:40.671
>> I got your back.

22:40.671 --> 22:41.672
>> No, no, I got your back more.

22:41.672 --> 22:42.640
>> I got your back.

22:42.640 --> 22:43.708
>> I got your back more.

22:43.708 --> 22:44.976
>> Okay!

22:44.976 --> 22:46.110
Let's just sign the paperwork.

22:46.110 --> 22:47.411
>> Sure.

22:47.411 --> 22:48.446
(phone chirps)

22:48.446 --> 22:50.348
Knowshon Moreno is injured?

22:50.348 --> 22:51.782
You just traded him to me.

22:51.782 --> 22:53.050
>> Oh, did he get injured again?

22:53.050 --> 22:54.518
>> You screwed me over.

22:54.518 --> 22:55.586
How am I supposed to trust you

22:55.586 --> 22:56.954
if I can't trust you here?

22:56.954 --> 22:58.756
>> This is business.

22:58.756 --> 23:00.658
That is fantasy.

23:00.658 --> 23:01.692
>> No, it isn't.

23:01.692 --> 23:02.793
He's injured in real life.

23:02.793 --> 23:03.828
>> Oh, it works like that?

23:03.828 --> 23:05.029
>> And you, you told me to take

23:05.029 --> 23:06.397
this trade.

23:06.397 --> 23:07.531
>> Okay, as your Realtor, I give

23:07.531 --> 23:09.100
you solid advice on closing this

23:09.100 --> 23:10.568
deal.

23:10.568 --> 23:12.403
When it comes to fantasy, I am

23:12.403 --> 23:13.704
your opponent, and mama is gonna

23:13.704 --> 23:16.507
get that beach house!

23:16.507 --> 23:17.508
>> Okay, you know what, I'm

23:17.508 --> 23:18.509
screwed. It's Sunday morning.

23:18.509 --> 23:19.510
I have no one to pick up.

23:19.510 --> 23:20.511
(phone chirping)

23:20.511 --> 23:21.712
All right, and I...

23:21.712 --> 23:22.847
Whoa, look at this.

23:22.847 --> 23:23.814
Ruxin just dropped Pierre

23:23.814 --> 23:24.815
Garçon, Pete just dropped Alfred

23:24.815 --> 23:25.916
Morris, and Kevin dropped

23:25.916 --> 23:27.585
DeSean Jackson?

23:27.585 --> 23:28.586
>> No, no, no, no.

23:28.586 --> 23:29.587
>> And I'm number one on the

23:29.587 --> 23:30.688
waiver wire.

23:30.688 --> 23:32.556
>> (groans) Tefl-Andre is back.

23:32.556 --> 23:33.691
>> Oh, this is gonna be great.

23:33.691 --> 23:34.759
>> So, we're still doing this

23:34.759 --> 23:35.893
partnership thing, right?

23:35.893 --> 23:36.894
>> Yeah, yeah, whatever. Oh!

23:36.894 --> 23:38.062
>> Okay, great.

23:38.062 --> 23:39.063
>> Who does Daddy want?

23:39.063 --> 23:40.097
>> And I'm gonna sign for you,

23:40.097 --> 23:40.965
too.

23:40.965 --> 23:41.899
>> (laughs): Look out.

23:41.899 --> 23:43.367
>> And here.

23:43.367 --> 23:44.001
>> Andre.

23:44.001 --> 23:46.137
>> Look at this lineup.

23:50.675 --> 23:51.776
(groans)

23:51.776 --> 23:52.977
>> Oh, how'd it go?

23:52.977 --> 23:54.078
How was Manland?

23:54.078 --> 23:56.013
How'd my little ninny do, Daddy?

23:56.013 --> 23:57.114
>> Oh, Kevin's no ninny.

23:57.114 --> 23:58.382
He's a man.

23:58.382 --> 23:59.417
>> He is?

23:59.417 --> 24:00.484
>> You can go hunting with me

24:00.484 --> 24:01.485
anytime.

24:01.485 --> 24:02.520
>> Thank you, Bruce.

24:02.520 --> 24:03.521
Come here, babe.

24:03.521 --> 24:04.522
I missed you so much.

24:04.522 --> 24:05.690
>> I missed you.

24:05.690 --> 24:06.824
Hey.

24:06.824 --> 24:07.858
>> Let's go upstairs.

24:07.858 --> 24:09.126
Come here.

24:09.126 --> 24:10.461
>> Whoa! Who is this?

24:10.461 --> 24:11.495
(laughs)

24:11.495 --> 24:12.530
>> I'm Brian.

24:12.530 --> 24:13.531
>> Bye, Daddy.

24:13.531 --> 24:15.766
>> There goes my little Banger.
