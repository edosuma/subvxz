09:10.384 --> 09:12.760
In my room?

09:12.802 --> 09:14.846
Michelle, you have to learn

09:12.802 --> 09:14.846
how to share.

09:14.888 --> 09:17.140
Now, today it's Tony's room too,

09:14.888 --> 09:17.140
okay?

09:17.182 --> 09:18.850
This is nuts.

09:20.810 --> 09:22.562
Alright, big Ton.

09:20.810 --> 09:22.562
Let me sing you a little song.

09:22.603 --> 09:24.398
You can go to sleep, okay?

09:22.603 --> 09:24.398

Uncle Jesse

09:45.710 --> 09:49.464
doesn't like me anymore.

09:55.220 --> 09:56.555
Hey, guys, I finally got it.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.723
I finally figured out

09:56.596 --> 09:58.723
D.J.'s math problem.

09:58.765 --> 10:01.059
According to my calculations,

09:58.765 --> 10:01.059
Bill can buy

10:01.101 --> 10:03.478
a pound of walnuts for..

10:08.442 --> 10:10.527
...fifty three thousand dollars.

10:12.529 --> 10:14.906
Well, that's what

10:12.529 --> 10:14.906
the Pentagon would pay.

10:22.830 --> 10:24.916
Too spicy?

10:24.958 --> 10:28.295
No, no. I always cry

10:24.958 --> 10:28.295
when I eat chicken.

10:30.547 --> 10:32.382
It's pasta.

10:34.134 --> 10:36.677
Uncle Jesse,

10:34.134 --> 10:36.677
come with me, please.

10:36.719 --> 10:39.389
- Okay, where are we going?

10:36.719 --> 10:39.389
- To see Tony.

10:39.431 --> 10:42.058
- What's the matter with Tony?

10:39.431 --> 10:42.058
- He's still here.

10:43.851 --> 10:45.728
Come on, Beck,

10:43.851 --> 10:45.728
check this out with me.

10:45.770 --> 10:48.398
- What about my dinner?

10:45.770 --> 10:48.398
- Uh, just let it fester.

10:52.735 --> 10:54.862
I mean simmer.

10:54.904 --> 10:56.697
Ow!

10:56.739 --> 10:59.284
Hello, Mohammed's House of Nuts?

11:05.415 --> 11:08.751
Yes, hello,

11:05.415 --> 11:08.751
my name is, uh, Bill.

11:11.796 --> 11:14.048
Yeah, look, I'm, uh,

11:11.796 --> 11:14.048
I'm having a party

11:14.090 --> 11:17.594
and my nut budget is exactly..

11:17.636 --> 11:21.139
...seven dollars and 50 cents.

11:21.181 --> 11:23.766
Now, if a third of my friends

11:21.181 --> 11:23.766
like almonds

11:23.808 --> 11:27.562
and almonds cost,

11:23.808 --> 11:27.562
let's see, $4 a pound..

11:29.648 --> 11:31.899
No, this isn't for homework.

11:35.612 --> 11:39.366
Yes, I know I'll-I'll never

11:35.612 --> 11:39.366
learn if I don't do it myself.

11:44.538 --> 11:47.040
Time to go home. Bye-bye, Tony.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.252
Oh, Michelle, that wasn't

11:49.000 --> 11:51.252
very cool. You woke up the kid.

11:51.294 --> 11:53.588
Good, now he could go home.

11:53.630 --> 11:55.382
Oh, Michelle,

11:53.630 --> 11:55.382
you don't mean that.

11:55.423 --> 11:58.759
- Oh, yes, I do.

11:55.423 --> 11:58.759
- Alright, come on, buddy.

11:58.801 --> 12:01.221
Here we go. Here we go, Tony.

12:01.262 --> 12:03.931
- Okay, bud.

12:01.262 --> 12:03.931
- My turn. Carry me.

12:03.973 --> 12:05.724
Michelle, I'm taking care

12:03.973 --> 12:05.724
of the baby right now.

12:05.766 --> 12:07.310
I'll carry you later, okay?

12:07.352 --> 12:09.521
You okay, Ton? You okay, buddy?

12:11.730 --> 12:13.608
Hey, Jess.

12:13.650 --> 12:16.236
I think that Michelle's jealous

12:13.650 --> 12:16.236
because baby Tony's

12:16.277 --> 12:18.697
getting all

12:16.277 --> 12:18.697
of her uncle's attention.

12:18.737 --> 12:21.408
- Now she wants to be the baby.

12:18.737 --> 12:21.408
- Hey, baby, hey..

12:21.449 --> 12:23.868
What would give you

12:21.449 --> 12:23.868
a crazy idea like that?

12:23.910 --> 12:27.581
Well, intuition, instinct.

12:27.622 --> 12:29.123
And the fact that Michelle's

12:27.622 --> 12:29.123
sitting in the crib

12:29.165 --> 12:31.125
sucking her thumb.

12:33.169 --> 12:34.753
I'm a baby.

12:36.339 --> 12:37.632
Here.

12:37.674 --> 12:41.177
Michelle, you're not a baby.

12:37.674 --> 12:41.177
You're a big girl.

12:41.219 --> 12:44.013
Goo goo ga ga.

12:44.055 --> 12:46.099
Beck, we gotta do something

12:44.055 --> 12:46.099
about this.

12:46.140 --> 12:47.726
Well, I think

12:46.140 --> 12:47.726
the obvious thing to do

12:47.766 --> 12:51.396
is to reward Michelle

12:47.766 --> 12:51.396
for acting like a big girl.

12:51.438 --> 12:55.108
You obviously know nothing

12:51.438 --> 12:55.108
about child psychology.

12:55.149 --> 12:57.652
- Oh, really?

12:55.149 --> 12:57.652
- Yes, really. It's very simple.

12:57.694 --> 13:00.363
You just have to look them in

12:57.694 --> 13:00.363
the eye and lay down the law.

13:00.405 --> 13:03.241
Watch...and learn.

13:04.825 --> 13:07.495
Should I take notes,

13:04.825 --> 13:07.495
oh, wise one?

13:09.289 --> 13:11.124
Wouldn't hurt.

13:11.165 --> 13:13.000
Alright, Michelle, now come on,

13:11.165 --> 13:13.000
stop clowning around.

13:13.042 --> 13:14.835
You get out of that thing

13:13.042 --> 13:14.835
and start showing us

13:14.877 --> 13:16.879
what a big girl you are.

13:16.921 --> 13:18.715
[imitating baby cry]

13:21.050 --> 13:22.761
Ready to try the reward method?

13:22.801 --> 13:25.179
Oh, please, that never works.

13:25.221 --> 13:28.141
Well, if you try it, I'll give

13:25.221 --> 13:28.141
you one of my special back rubs.

13:28.182 --> 13:30.226
It's worth a shot.

13:30.268 --> 13:32.979
Why, because

13:30.268 --> 13:32.979
I'm gonna reward you?

13:36.899 --> 13:38.359
Well, maybe.

13:38.401 --> 13:39.569
Just because you tricked me

13:38.401 --> 13:39.569
doesn't mean

13:39.611 --> 13:41.738
Michelle's dumb enough

13:39.611 --> 13:41.738
to fall for it.

13:49.120 --> 13:51.498
Deej, I've been working on

13:49.120 --> 13:51.498
this problem for over an hour

13:51.539 --> 13:52.957
and the answer is..

13:52.999 --> 13:56.169
...you're never gonna use

13:52.999 --> 13:56.169
algebra in real life.

13:56.210 --> 13:58.212
- Joey--

13:56.210 --> 13:58.212
- No, I let you down.

13:58.254 --> 14:00.256
Now you'll never

13:58.254 --> 14:00.256
get into college.

14:00.298 --> 14:02.049
You'll end up working

14:00.298 --> 14:02.049
in some diner

14:02.091 --> 14:04.469
serving chicken-fried steaks

14:02.091 --> 14:04.469
and creamed corn

14:04.511 --> 14:09.390
to truck drivers named

14:04.511 --> 14:09.390
Tiny, and Duke, and Buck.

14:09.432 --> 14:11.017
Joey, relax.

14:11.058 --> 14:13.770
I called the Homework Hotline

14:11.058 --> 14:13.770
and they helped me do it.

14:13.812 --> 14:18.274
See, X is the total, Y is the

14:13.812 --> 14:18.274
price of a pound of walnuts.

14:18.316 --> 14:21.194
So the walnuts are Z

14:18.316 --> 14:21.194
and Z equals X minus Y

14:21.235 --> 14:24.071
divided by two which makes

14:21.235 --> 14:24.071
the price of the walnuts

14:24.113 --> 14:26.115
five dollars and 50 cents.

14:26.157 --> 14:30.787
Oh, sure, it's easy when you use

14:26.157 --> 14:30.787
letters. I was using real nuts.

14:30.829 --> 14:32.706
Alright, Deej,

14:30.829 --> 14:32.706
give me another problem.

14:32.747 --> 14:34.457
- Okay.

14:34.499 --> 14:37.627
Here we go. Page 62.

14:37.669 --> 14:42.507
And numbers one through 20. Show

14:37.669 --> 14:42.507
all your work, neatness counts.

14:42.549 --> 14:45.176
I'll get right on it.

14:45.218 --> 14:48.346
Doing my homework.

14:45.218 --> 14:48.346
Can't talk now.

14:48.388 --> 14:51.140
Who wanted to talk to him?

14:51.182 --> 14:53.100
Alright, listen, girls,

14:51.182 --> 14:53.100
I'm having a little problem.

14:53.142 --> 14:54.853
I wanna ask you about something.

14:54.894 --> 14:56.771
You know, I've been kinda

14:54.894 --> 14:56.771
hanging around with Tony

14:56.813 --> 14:58.565
and Michelle's

14:56.813 --> 14:58.565
startin' to get jealous.

14:58.606 --> 15:01.067
You know, and Tony's a baby so

14:58.606 --> 15:01.067
Michelle's acting like a baby

15:01.108 --> 15:03.570
and I figured maybe I'd give her

15:01.108 --> 15:03.570
something really special

15:03.611 --> 15:05.488
to reward her

15:03.611 --> 15:05.488
for acting like a big girl.

15:05.530 --> 15:07.782
So do you guys have any ideas?

15:07.824 --> 15:10.410
Well, you know, Michelle has

15:07.824 --> 15:10.410
had her eye on Mr. Bear

15:10.451 --> 15:12.620
ever since she could crawl.

15:15.039 --> 15:18.251
So, what's your point?

15:18.292 --> 15:20.211
Well, you always said that

15:18.292 --> 15:20.211
one day you were gonna give

15:20.253 --> 15:22.630
Mr. Bear to Michelle.

15:22.672 --> 15:26.384
Well, when I said one day,

15:22.672 --> 15:26.384
I meant like her wedding day.

15:28.386 --> 15:31.598
Here, why don't you give her

15:28.386 --> 15:31.598
your Pillow Person?

15:31.639 --> 15:35.184
Because Mr. Bear

15:31.639 --> 15:35.184
is a child's toy.

15:35.226 --> 15:38.938
My Pillow Person

15:35.226 --> 15:38.938
is a sophisticated companion.

15:41.274 --> 15:43.484
Please. Sophisticated?

15:43.526 --> 15:47.196
It's got arms and legs

15:43.526 --> 15:47.196
growing out of its face.

15:49.407 --> 15:53.994
- I say we let Michelle decide.

15:49.407 --> 15:53.994
- Fine with me.

15:57.331 --> 16:01.127
It is a stupid-looking pillow.

16:01.168 --> 16:03.045
Michelle, pick a toy.

16:03.087 --> 16:06.215
Haven't you always wanted

16:03.087 --> 16:06.215
this darling, little bear?

16:06.257 --> 16:10.177
I'm sure you'd rather have

16:06.257 --> 16:10.177
this sophisticated companion.

16:10.219 --> 16:14.014
You don't want this

16:10.219 --> 16:14.014
boring, square person.

16:14.056 --> 16:18.937
But he's much better than

16:14.056 --> 16:18.937
this disgusting, yucky old bear.

16:18.978 --> 16:20.855
I'll explain later.

16:22.356 --> 16:24.692
Michelle, if you get one

16:22.356 --> 16:24.692
of these toys

16:24.734 --> 16:26.068
you're gonna have to act

16:24.734 --> 16:26.068

And when he does, I'll be

18:18.723 --> 18:22.142
waiting with a doggy yummy.

18:22.184 --> 18:23.686
Danny, I'm glad you're here.

18:22.184 --> 18:23.686
I have some..

18:23.728 --> 18:25.855
I'm having a little problem

18:23.728 --> 18:25.855
with Michelle.

18:25.897 --> 18:28.024
You know how I've been

18:25.897 --> 18:28.024
hanging out with Tony?

18:28.066 --> 18:29.483
Well, Michelle's

18:28.066 --> 18:29.483
starting to freak out.

18:29.525 --> 18:30.944
She's acting like a baby.

18:30.985 --> 18:33.613
Ah, poor kid.

18:30.985 --> 18:33.613
How did you handle it?

18:33.654 --> 18:35.573
Well, I told her

18:33.654 --> 18:35.573
to straighten up

18:35.615 --> 18:37.700
and start acting like an adult.

18:37.742 --> 18:40.828
And when that didn't work,

18:37.742 --> 18:40.828
what did you do?

18:40.870 --> 18:42.413
Well, we tried giving her

18:40.870 --> 18:42.413
a reward

18:42.455 --> 18:44.457
for acting, uh, like a big girl.

18:44.498 --> 18:46.084
You tried to bribe her?

18:46.125 --> 18:49.796
Don't cheapen it.

18:46.125 --> 18:49.796
What should I do?

18:49.837 --> 18:52.632
Well, I think if you want

18:49.837 --> 18:52.632
Michelle to act like a big girl

18:52.673 --> 18:55.051
you have to talk to her

18:52.673 --> 18:55.051
like she's a big girl

18:55.093 --> 18:58.096
in words

18:55.093 --> 18:58.096
that she'll understand.

18:58.137 --> 19:00.056
You got it, dude.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.144
Alright, Michelle.

19:05.185 --> 19:08.355
It's time for a special

19:05.185 --> 19:08.355
uncle-to-niece talk, okay?

19:08.397 --> 19:10.858
I'm not giving Willie back.

19:13.152 --> 19:15.404
Alright, Michelle.

19:15.446 --> 19:16.656
Now you tell your Uncle Jesse

19:16.697 --> 19:18.616
why you're having

19:16.697 --> 19:18.616
a bummer of a day.

19:18.658 --> 19:20.910
You like Tony better than me.

19:22.536 --> 19:24.664
Michelle, that's not true.

19:24.705 --> 19:27.834
You're my best pal.

19:24.705 --> 19:27.834
We go back three years.

19:27.875 --> 19:32.338
You gave Tony my room

19:27.875 --> 19:32.338
and my song.

19:32.379 --> 19:35.800
I-I was just trying to be nice

19:32.379 --> 19:35.800
to our new friend.

19:35.842 --> 19:38.260
But I should have

19:35.842 --> 19:38.260
asked you first

19:38.302 --> 19:41.806
'cause I'd never wanna

19:38.302 --> 19:41.806
hurt your feelings, pal.

19:41.848 --> 19:44.433
- You wanna know why?

19:41.848 --> 19:44.433
- Why?

19:44.475 --> 19:46.393
Come here.

19:46.435 --> 19:49.063
I'll tell you why.

19:49.105 --> 19:51.899
[instrumental music]

19:51.941 --> 19:54.861
'Cause you make me laugh,

19:51.941 --> 19:54.861
Michelle.

19:54.902 --> 19:56.863
You make me smile.

19:56.904 --> 19:59.740
You make me feel good

19:56.904 --> 19:59.740
about caring about somebody.

19:59.782 --> 20:02.785
- I do that?

19:59.782 --> 20:02.785
- Yeah, you do that.

20:04.411 --> 20:08.749
Michelle, you and I

20:04.411 --> 20:08.749
are gonna be together forever

20:08.791 --> 20:10.793
and Tony's leaving tomorrow.

20:10.835 --> 20:13.420
He is?

20:13.462 --> 20:15.048
Yes, he is.

20:15.089 --> 20:17.884
And I want you to know

20:15.089 --> 20:17.884
something.

20:17.925 --> 20:20.845
There's gonna be a lot of people

20:17.925 --> 20:20.845
that come in and out of my life.

20:20.887 --> 20:23.430
But you're always

20:20.887 --> 20:23.430
gonna be number one.

20:23.472 --> 20:27.018
You're gonna be my best pal,

20:23.472 --> 20:27.018
my buddy, my sidekick.

20:27.060 --> 20:28.936
- You know why?

20:27.060 --> 20:28.936
- Why?

20:28.978 --> 20:31.189
'Cause I love you

20:28.978 --> 20:31.189
very, very much.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.607
- How much?

20:31.230 --> 20:33.607
- You wanna know how much?

20:33.649 --> 20:37.444
I'll show you how much.

20:33.649 --> 20:37.444
I love you this much.

20:37.486 --> 20:40.073
- Wow!

20:37.486 --> 20:40.073
- How much do you love me?

20:40.114 --> 20:41.908
- This much.

20:40.114 --> 20:41.908
- That much?

20:41.949 --> 20:43.701
Oh, our arms are open.

20:41.949 --> 20:43.701
We have to hug.

20:43.743 --> 20:45.953
It's a given, it's a given.

20:47.705 --> 20:51.291
Michelle, I've been thinking

20:47.705 --> 20:51.291
about it, and, you know

20:51.333 --> 20:53.836
you might need that bear

20:51.333 --> 20:53.836
more than I do.

20:53.878 --> 20:56.047
So have a nice life

20:53.878 --> 20:56.047
with Mr. Bear.

20:56.089 --> 20:58.549
I mean, Willie.

21:01.301 --> 21:03.512
Here, you can have Mr. Bear.

21:05.848 --> 21:09.476
Michelle, I love you so much.

21:09.518 --> 21:11.729
Everybody loves me.

21:14.107 --> 21:16.442
That was a wet kiss.

21:18.236 --> 21:20.362
I'm hip.

21:20.404 --> 21:22.448
Come here.

21:22.489 --> 21:23.950
Now, let me tell you

21:22.489 --> 21:23.950
something, Michelle.

21:23.991 --> 21:27.120
That was very nice

21:23.991 --> 21:27.120
that you gave the bear back.

21:27.161 --> 21:29.329
You really are a big girl.

21:29.371 --> 21:31.082
I'm hip.

21:33.042 --> 21:36.045
- How did we do?

21:33.042 --> 21:36.045
- We did pretty good, didn't we?

21:36.087 --> 21:38.047
Wanna make friends with Tony?

21:38.089 --> 21:39.715
Yes, I would.

21:39.757 --> 21:42.676
Tony, you're a nice baby.

21:42.718 --> 21:45.054
Give Tony a kiss.

21:42.718 --> 21:45.054
Give him a kiss.

21:47.014 --> 21:49.558
You know, one day

21:47.014 --> 21:49.558
you're gonna make a great dad.

21:49.600 --> 21:53.437
Give Jesse a kiss.

21:49.600 --> 21:53.437
Give him a kiss.

21:53.479 --> 21:55.731
Oh, yeah. Have mercy.

21:55.773 --> 21:57.691
- Can you say have mercy?

21:55.773 --> 21:57.691
- Can you say that, little guy?

21:57.733 --> 22:01.612
Have mercy. Have mercy.

21:57.733 --> 22:01.612
You will someday.

22:01.654 --> 22:05.908
Here we go. Time to go to sleep.

22:01.654 --> 22:05.908
There you go, big Ton-o-rama.

22:05.950 --> 22:08.911
Here we go, man.

22:05.950 --> 22:08.911
Brr. Brr.

22:08.953 --> 22:10.704
Goodnight, Tony.

22:10.746 --> 22:16.210
Oh, Michelle,

22:10.746 --> 22:16.210
that's so sweet. Come on.

22:16.252 --> 22:19.421
You're going home tomorrow,

22:16.252 --> 22:19.421
you remember?
