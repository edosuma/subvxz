You and me,

Mm-hmm.

00:10.469 --> 00:11.800
Come on.

00:15.349 --> 00:16.680
You call them
Freelancers.

00:16.767 --> 00:19.258
They have
no formal identity.

00:19.437 --> 00:20.426
(GUNSHOTS)

00:20.855 --> 00:23.221
They're more of a cult,
and the time continuum

00:23.316 --> 00:24.476
is their chess board.

00:24.567 --> 00:25.852
And people like us
are a liability

00:25.943 --> 00:28.150
because we understand
what's at stake.

00:28.237 --> 00:30.193
I had this memory
from when l was little...

00:30.281 --> 00:32.647
SADLER: It was me,
my mom, and Jason.

00:32.783 --> 00:35.525
What if Jason's my...
It's easy enough
to gather the proof.

00:35.620 --> 00:37.235
EMILY: A little DNA.

00:37.330 --> 00:38.410
ESCH ER: What is it, Emily?

00:38.497 --> 00:39.998
I need you to pull me out.

00:40.124 --> 00:42.490
You have feelings
for him?
Yes.

00:42.585 --> 00:44.871
He's a good man,
and I think he's
doing the right thing.

00:45.004 --> 00:46.369
And I don't believe
that we're...
Emily.

00:46.464 --> 00:48.420
I don't pay you to think.

KIERA: Excuse me.

01:09.987 --> 01:12.239
CPS coming through,
excuse me.

01:16.577 --> 01:18.192
The victim's name
is Ramona Cathers.

01:18.287 --> 01:20.994
SadTech Engineer.
I know, I already
spoke with her wife.

01:21.082 --> 01:23.824
BioReckon places

at 23:42:18.

01:24.877 --> 01:26.492
Liber8's getting lazy.

01:26.837 --> 01:29.328
They had to know
we'd have covered this
from every angle.

01:50.403 --> 01:52.018
What's wrong with

01:52.113 --> 01:54.069
CPS Main, this is
Officer Cameron

01:54.156 --> 01:57.193
requesting enhancement,
grid points 3A to 3F.

02:01.414 --> 02:03.075
It's some kind of
cloaking tech.

02:03.165 --> 02:05.451
Yeah, and more
advanced than ours.

02:05.543 --> 02:09.331
They're scrambling
digital signals from
every conceivable angle.

02:11.549 --> 02:12.880
Excuse me.

02:15.845 --> 02:18.461
This grid disruption
is unbelievable.

02:18.556 --> 02:20.296
We have no way
of identifying
the killer.

02:20.391 --> 02:21.927
We're doing
everything
we can, sir.

02:22.018 --> 02:24.100
According to her wife,
Ms. Cathers was working

02:24.186 --> 02:25.926
on a high-security
project for SadTech.

02:26.022 --> 02:27.137
Any details?

02:27.231 --> 02:28.562
Apparently she never
discussed it,

02:28.649 --> 02:31.356
butlaccessed
her message service
and I pulled the logs.

02:31.444 --> 02:34.106
Most of them were routine,
but this one...

02:34.947 --> 02:36.733
Was marked "urgent."

02:37.616 --> 02:38.651
What is it?

02:38.743 --> 02:40.950
I've already run
the schematic through
the CPS data hub,

02:41.037 --> 02:42.197
couldn't find a match,

02:42.288 --> 02:45.530
but her engineering
specialization
was anti-matter.

02:46.417 --> 02:48.453
Data tracking shows her
visiting the penitentiary

02:48.544 --> 02:50.660
over a dozen times
in the past two weeks.

02:50.755 --> 02:52.666
It doesn't add up.
Why there?

02:52.757 --> 02:53.837
Excellent work,
Cameron.

02:53.924 --> 02:55.050
I'll take over
from here.

02:55.134 --> 02:56.749
Sir, if I could speak to
someone from SadTech,

02:56.844 --> 02:59.130
maybe find out
a little bit more
about her assignment,

02:59.221 --> 03:01.507
it might have
something to do
with the execution.

03:01.599 --> 03:02.805

03:02.892 --> 03:04.553
This case is being
bumped upstairs.

03:04.643 --> 03:06.144

Officer Cameron.

03:06.228 --> 03:07.559

03:28.542 --> 03:29.531
KIERA: 2077.

03:29.627 --> 03:31.993
My time, my city, my family.

03:32.088 --> 03:34.295
When terrorists killed
thousands of innocents,

03:34.382 --> 03:35.838
they were condemned to die.

03:35.925 --> 03:37.040
They had other plans.

03:37.134 --> 03:39.841
A time-travel device
sent us all back 65 years.

03:41.097 --> 03:44.385

what / will return to

03:44.475 --> 03:45.464
Their plan,

03:45.559 --> 03:48.722
to corrupt
and control the present
in order to win the future.

03:48.813 --> 03:50.644
What they didn’t plan on
was me.

04:02.993 --> 04:04.324
What the hell is this?

04:04.870 --> 04:06.121
lt's play money.

04:06.622 --> 04:08.237

04:08.332 --> 04:09.833

what you're playing.

04:10.584 --> 04:12.245
We have a
bigger problem,

04:12.420 --> 04:14.160
and I'm still waiting
for you to solve it.

04:14.255 --> 04:15.461
You mean Escher?

04:15.548 --> 04:16.788
I'm not interested.

04:16.882 --> 04:19.544
You see, you don't get
to dictate the terms

04:19.635 --> 04:21.091

04:21.178 --> 04:22.634

anything that I need.

05:31.332 --> 05:32.321
Come again?

05:32.416 --> 05:33.747
The last place I could
track Gardiner to

05:33.834 --> 05:36.246
was a law firm,
Fisker and Associates.

05:36.462 --> 05:37.577
He'd found a trail,

05:37.671 --> 05:39.536
thought they might be
working with Freelancers.

05:39.632 --> 05:41.839
The landlord said
he dropped by on a Monday

05:41.926 --> 05:43.837
and the place had
been cleaned out.

05:43.928 --> 05:45.213
Businesses close,

05:45.304 --> 05:47.295
and it's safe to assume that
Gardiner had other cases.

05:47.389 --> 05:49.971
No, Gardiner was
obsessed with this.

05:50.684 --> 05:51.935

05:56.732 --> 06:00.520
No, but his shrinks say that
he's psychotic and violent.

06:00.653 --> 06:03.565
He's going to be
roped and doped for
the foreseeable future.

06:03.656 --> 06:05.362
As long as he's alive,
he's a threat.

06:05.449 --> 06:07.861
He keeps telling the medical
staff that he's from 2077

06:07.952 --> 06:10.284

to dead people.

out of reality,

09:08.048 --> 09:09.208
The amount of energy

isn't something you can
just pick up

09:11.468 --> 09:12.548
at your local
hardware store.

09:12.636 --> 09:13.876
But it is available.

09:13.971 --> 09:15.256
Theoretically, yes.

09:15.347 --> 09:17.724
A company named LaRoche
is working on an anti-matter
power generation,

09:17.808 --> 09:19.298
it's huge yield stuff.

09:19.393 --> 09:22.305

viable until the 2040s.

09:22.604 --> 09:23.855
In your history.

09:23.939 --> 09:25.179
But, your good friend Escher

09:25.274 --> 09:27.356
just bought LaRoche Energy
recently, coincidence?

09:27.443 --> 09:28.478

09:28.569 --> 09:29.729
Then I'll talkto him.

l'll persuade him to let us
take a look at it.

provide the power source,

09:33.449 --> 09:35.815
there's still other factors.

Say you returned to the
exact time and place

09:38.162 --> 09:39.618

09:39.705 --> 09:41.821
There's no guarantee
that it's the same

I'm willing to take
that risk.

to whoever took the bodies.

10:43.894 --> 10:44.929
Hello.

10:45.020 --> 10:46.885
I'm gonna call this in.

10:47.564 --> 10:48.599
CARLOS: Wha...

10:48.690 --> 10:49.645
I need to look at that.

10:49.733 --> 10:51.314
Come on, Carlos.
You know procedure.

10:51.401 --> 10:52.356
She's my partner.

10:52.444 --> 10:53.559
He's a federal agent!

10:53.654 --> 10:57.397
There's no way that I...
Just hold off on filing it,
for an hour, tops.

10:57.491 --> 10:59.356
So you can wipe away all
the incriminating evidence?

10:59.576 --> 11:01.077
You know me better
than that.

11:02.287 --> 11:03.322
Hey!

11:03.539 --> 11:05.029
We take care of our own.

11:21.890 --> 11:22.970
Hey!

11:25.352 --> 11:26.853
I understand
you're the genius

11:26.937 --> 11:28.848
who persuaded Alec
to destroy Arc.

11:28.939 --> 11:30.224
I can't make him
do anything.

11:30.315 --> 11:31.771

that's not true.

laid for the first
time in his life,

11:33.527 --> 11:35.017
he'd rob a bank
ifyou asked him.

11:35.112 --> 11:36.568
Pretty much what you did
the moment you asked him

11:36.655 --> 11:38.020
to go into business with you.

11:38.115 --> 11:39.901
Hey, I've invested
millions in Alec Sadler.

11:39.992 --> 11:41.448
I'm all in.

11:41.535 --> 11:43.071
And my plans aren't
about to be hijacked

11:43.161 --> 11:46.369
by some smug piece
of ass, however buoyant.

11:47.416 --> 11:48.656
Whoa, whoa.

11:49.251 --> 11:50.286
You don't want to do that.

11:50.377 --> 11:51.708
You know what else
I don't want to do?

11:51.795 --> 11:55.708
Tell Alec what I found out
about Maya Hartwell.

11:56.842 --> 11:58.207
It's a cute last name.

11:58.302 --> 12:00.088
Two years, less a day,
for extortion,

12:00.178 --> 12:02.385

no convictions...

12:02.472 --> 12:04.463
The last 18 months
are murky for now,

12:04.558 --> 12:06.389
but I do love how
you disappeared

12:06.476 --> 12:09.183
right after the mysterious
death of a boyfriend.

12:09.271 --> 12:10.556

12:10.647 --> 12:12.057
Aw, you must have been
heartbroken.

12:12.149 --> 12:13.389
l was.

12:13.483 --> 12:15.223
You know who else
would be heartbroken?

12:15.485 --> 12:17.771
Alec, after he learns
you work for Escher

12:17.863 --> 12:19.194
and that you've been
stringing him along

12:19.281 --> 12:22.239
so your boss can screw him
out of his future.

12:24.578 --> 12:26.864
You've been a bad
influence so far.

12:26.955 --> 12:30.118
I'm giving you a chance
to turn your life around.

12:30.626 --> 12:32.833
Convince Alec
to resurrect Arc.

12:33.295 --> 12:35.502
Or better yet,
have Escher give it back.

12:36.632 --> 12:37.712
I can't do that.

12:37.799 --> 12:39.414
Can, and will.

12:39.843 --> 12:41.708
Or it all comes out.

12:41.887 --> 12:42.922
He may think he loves you,

12:43.013 --> 12:45.129
but he hasn't really
met you yet, has he?

12:45.682 --> 12:46.842
Hey.

12:47.559 --> 12:50.642
I'm thrilled we made a real
connection here, Maya.

12:51.688 --> 12:53.019
Big kiss.

12:56.610 --> 12:59.147
You know this is a CSlS
key drive, right?

12:59.363 --> 13:01.945
And I'm not supposed to ask
why you have it?

13:02.032 --> 13:03.192
Sinking ship.

13:03.283 --> 13:05.319
You sure you want to board?

13:06.036 --> 13:07.116
Okay.

13:08.080 --> 13:10.696
So what I'm about to do
neverhappened.

13:10.958 --> 13:12.118
Thanks.

That's weird,
there's no encryption.

a thing for Kiera,

13:20.467 --> 13:22.708
but this is stalker level.

13:22.803 --> 13:26.091
Is there anything
about dead bodies,
or the morgue?

13:26.181 --> 13:28.467
Hmm. As far as I can see,
this is all about

13:28.558 --> 13:31.686
making Kiera look like
she was linked to Liber8.

13:32.729 --> 13:34.890
It's pretty compelling, too.

13:36.066 --> 13:39.433
Maybe she was more
sympathetic to their cause
than we realized.

13:39.528 --> 13:40.768

13:41.405 --> 13:43.896
Some of the things
they stand for...

13:44.491 --> 13:45.947
Make sense.

13:46.910 --> 13:48.821
That could be what Gardiner
found out and er...

13:48.912 --> 13:50.277
This was planted.

13:50.372 --> 13:52.033
Kiera's being setup.

Eventually I'll be able
to tell you everything.

any other way.

all right?

for a while.

14:40.797 --> 14:42.537
I'm sorry, I know
it's kind of sudden,

14:42.632 --> 14:43.621
itjust can't be helped.

14:43.717 --> 14:44.923
And it's not you,
don't even go there.

14:45.010 --> 14:46.045
What is it?

14:46.136 --> 14:48.343
Hopefully I can come back
in a few weeks.

14:48.430 --> 14:49.385
Hopefully?

14:49.473 --> 14:50.758

to a few months?

Wait, just stop!

what's wrong, I mean it!

You know I've had
trouble with my past.

14:59.816 --> 15:02.273
It looks like some of it
is catching up with me,

15:02.360 --> 15:05.352

if I hit the road.

the police?
I can't.

as the killer.

I do this, and you
just kill us both.

to dry up the pond.

I could get back to my

sent me here.

And its inventor.

He would be willing
to work with you.

So we were a lie?
Everything was...

32:08.344 --> 32:09.333
Of course, it was!

32:09.428 --> 32:12.215
Jesus, you were asking
about the lab on
the second date!

32:12.306 --> 32:14.592
I'm in love
with you, Alec!

32:14.683 --> 32:17.766
It stopped being
an assignment
a long time ago!

32:18.813 --> 32:20.428
He bought a lot,

32:20.856 --> 32:22.187
but, he couldn't
buy that.

32:22.274 --> 32:24.265
Who is he?
Why would you do this?

32:24.360 --> 32:26.191
JASON: Hey, I got crackers!

32:26.278 --> 32:27.267
Guys?

32:27.363 --> 32:28.478
Here.

32:28.572 --> 32:30.278
Oh, come on!

32:30.366 --> 32:34.109
You gotta put that
thing away, they can
find us with that!

32:34.203 --> 32:35.283
Who can find us?

32:35.371 --> 32:36.451
The Freelancers!

32:36.539 --> 32:37.949
They'd kill for
that thing!

32:38.040 --> 32:40.076
They've done
worse for less,
believe me.

32:40.167 --> 32:42.954
I mean, come on.
I got through it.
I mean, I'm here now...

32:43.045 --> 32:45.627
Can these,
what'd you call them...
Freelancers,

32:45.714 --> 32:46.840
really find us
through that?

32:46.924 --> 32:49.506
Yeah, it's like
sending up a smoke signal!

32:49.593 --> 32:51.094
Is there another exit?

32:51.178 --> 32:52.167
Now see, she's smart.

32:52.263 --> 32:54.424
She knows how
dangerous they are.

32:54.515 --> 32:56.255
Call the last number!

32:58.269 --> 33:00.305
Back the hell away!

33:08.237 --> 33:09.818
She's working for Escher.

33:09.905 --> 33:14.615
She's been lying to you
about who she is from day one.

33:14.702 --> 33:15.908
I know.

33:17.538 --> 33:18.994
Then you can't
trust her.

33:19.081 --> 33:20.821
Ladies, dude!

33:20.916 --> 33:22.702
Try to keep this a
weapons-free zone!

33:22.793 --> 33:24.829
That whole thing about
leaving the country...

33:24.920 --> 33:26.581
Escher threatened me.

33:26.672 --> 33:29.163
Said if I grabbed
that sphere for him
he'd let me off the hook.

33:29.258 --> 33:31.374
Let me be with you
for real.

33:34.138 --> 33:35.799
I still want that.

33:37.391 --> 33:39.222
And whose number was it?

33:39.685 --> 33:40.925
Escher's.

33:41.228 --> 33:42.809
Whatever else he is,
he doesn't want you hurt.

33:42.897 --> 33:46.264
I know that for a fact.
He's dangerous,
and he's a liar!

33:46.358 --> 33:48.314
How did Travis get
into the lab?

33:48.402 --> 33:49.482
Kellog.

33:49.570 --> 33:50.685
VVhy?

33:50.779 --> 33:52.735
He set Travis up
with that suit

33:52.823 --> 33:55.155
to take care of his
Escher problem.

33:57.494 --> 33:58.870
You have the device.

33:59.163 --> 34:00.198
What is with that thing?

34:00.289 --> 34:02.655
That is truly none of
your business.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.365
It's a time travel device.

34:04.460 --> 34:06.416
It's how Kiera got here
from the future.
Alec!

34:06.503 --> 34:08.459
Her, Jason,
all the Liber8
terrorists...

34:08.547 --> 34:09.627
Escher, for all we know.

34:09.715 --> 34:11.251
Uh, no, not exactly.

34:11.342 --> 34:14.004
Time travel?
Are you serious?
Yes.

34:14.094 --> 34:15.834
And Escher wants it.

34:15.930 --> 34:17.466
So ifwe destroy it,

34:17.556 --> 34:20.468
then Escher has no
reason to pursue us!

34:21.310 --> 34:22.390
Listen, Alec, no!
You can't do this!

34:22.478 --> 34:24.218
It has caused nothing
but violence
ever since it arrived.

34:24.313 --> 34:25.803
I'm sorry, Kiera,
but there's
no other option.

34:25.898 --> 34:27.729
You know what that
means to me!

34:27.816 --> 34:30.273
Kiera, you need to
understand what it
means to me!

34:32.655 --> 34:33.940
Just send me back.

34:34.823 --> 34:37.656
Before Liber8 arrived.
I can prevent all of
this from happening!

34:37.743 --> 34:39.779
I told you, I don't know
if it's gonna work.

34:40.663 --> 34:41.652
lmean...

34:42.081 --> 34:43.287
Guns down.

34:43.374 --> 34:44.454
Now!

34:46.877 --> 34:48.663
I'm not going back there!

35:00.683 --> 35:02.264
Acquire the targets.

35:02.351 --> 35:04.467
The rest are expendable.

35:10.651 --> 35:11.891
Hand it over.

35:21.537 --> 35:22.572
Alec!

Get down! Get off the roof.

37:37.756 --> 37:39.462
JASON: Fourteen...
Come on!

37:49.643 --> 37:50.974
We have to get off this roof!

40:04.111 --> 40:05.567
Just hold on,
Emily, please, okay?

40:05.654 --> 40:07.064
Just hold on!

40:09.741 --> 40:11.572
I told you the truth.
You did.

40:11.660 --> 40:12.900
We both did.

40:15.330 --> 40:17.161
He couldn't take that.
