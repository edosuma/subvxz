00:06.110 --> 00:07.980
[Isabelle] <i>Previously
on</i> Shadowhunters...

00:08.070 --> 00:10.740
- Can you pledge your loyalty to the Clave?
- No, I can't.

00:10.820 --> 00:12.740
[Jace] <i>Valentine
has the Soul-Sword.</i>

00:12.830 --> 00:13.966
<i>He slaughtered the
Silent Brothers.</i>

00:13.990 --> 00:15.820
Take my son. Kill the other one.

00:15.910 --> 00:17.910
- [Aldertree] Get the Sword!
- [grunts]

00:18.620 --> 00:19.950
[Alec] What did I do?

00:20.040 --> 00:22.606
[Jace] <i>What happened with Jocelyn,
that wasn't you. That was the demon.</i>

00:22.630 --> 00:23.800
[Clary] It's inside her.

00:24.210 --> 00:25.530
Go back to Hell
where you belong.

00:26.550 --> 00:28.606
[Aldertree] <i>Something can
make the infection go away.</i>

00:28.630 --> 00:29.750
<i>It's called</i> yin fen.

00:29.840 --> 00:32.800
[Clary] <i>Mom...</i>
[Alec] <i>Clary, I'm so sorry.</i>

00:32.890 --> 00:34.810
[Clary] <i>I wish I could
get ahold of Luke.</i>

00:35.310 --> 00:37.060
- [Elaine] Simon!
- Oh, my...

00:41.440 --> 00:43.206
[Jace] <i>What the hell was that?</i>
[Clary] <i>I saw this vision,</i>

00:43.230 --> 00:45.070
- so I drew it.
- Let's keep this to ourselves.

00:46.530 --> 00:48.160
[Iron Sisters marching]

01:20.560 --> 01:24.320
<i>- Ignis aurum probat.</i>
- Always.

01:31.110 --> 01:32.820
[both yell]

01:51.720 --> 01:52.720
[yells]

01:52.800 --> 01:54.010
[both grunting]

02:04.350 --> 02:05.680
[chuckles]

02:06.560 --> 02:08.729
You let your mind
wander, Sister Cleophas.

02:08.820 --> 02:10.280
[both panting]

02:10.360 --> 02:12.490
A job well done, Iron Sisters.

02:13.150 --> 02:14.860
The swords pass inspection.

02:14.950 --> 02:16.700
[Dolores] Sisters.
I have news from Idris.

02:17.370 --> 02:20.210
The Circle has attacked
the City of Bones.

02:20.290 --> 02:22.840
Only a few survived.

02:22.910 --> 02:26.410
Valentine has taken
the Soul-Sword.

02:27.170 --> 02:29.090
Nobody is safe.

02:29.170 --> 02:30.880
Reinforce the Citadel.

02:59.200 --> 03:00.840
Yeah, I'm not seeing
it in the Gray Book.

03:00.870 --> 03:03.290
{\an8}Well, isn't that thing supposed
to have every single rune?

03:03.370 --> 03:04.410
{\an8}Some of them are removed.

03:04.500 --> 03:06.396
{\an8}They're reserved for the most
elite members of the Clave.

03:06.420 --> 03:09.510
{\an8}I'm not exactly elite,
so why do I know it?

03:09.590 --> 03:10.976
{\an8}Maybe you saw it somewhere
and you don't remember.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.960
{\an8}No, it just...
It appeared, like a vision.

03:14.050 --> 03:17.470
{\an8}Like someone or something was
trying to send me a message.

03:19.890 --> 03:21.100
Maybe it's from our mom.

03:21.930 --> 03:22.996
Clary, I know you miss her...

03:23.020 --> 03:24.560
How else do you explain it?

03:25.230 --> 03:26.860
{\an8}[sighs] I don't know.

03:27.560 --> 03:29.310
{\an8}You know,
I'll just go ask Izzy and Alec.

03:29.400 --> 03:30.786
{\an8}-Maybe they'll know something.
- No.

03:30.810 --> 03:32.310
{\an8}Absolutely not.

03:33.530 --> 03:35.910
{\an8}If you tell anyone else,
they could be in danger, too.

03:37.700 --> 03:41.910
{\an8}The Clave is quick to persecute anyone
or anything they don't understand.

03:44.330 --> 03:46.090
- [sighs]
- [knocking on door]

03:46.790 --> 03:47.920
Come in.

03:50.290 --> 03:54.580
{\an8}Just wanted to see how Clary was doing.
But if I'm interrupting something...

03:54.670 --> 03:55.920
{\an8}-Nope.
- No.

03:56.010 --> 03:57.600
{\an8}Not at all.

03:58.590 --> 04:01.090
{\an8}[Raphael] You've been home
for, what, a day?

04:01.180 --> 04:02.486
{\an8}And already you're letting
a mundane see you feed?

04:02.510 --> 04:05.406
{\an8}It's not like I invited her in.
Besides, I wouldn't be in this predicament

04:05.430 --> 04:07.760
{\an8}if you hadn't just brought
me the O-neg I asked for.

04:07.850 --> 04:09.640
Do I look like a
delivery boy to you?

04:09.730 --> 04:11.740
Raphael, I have no idea
what she's gonna do.

04:11.810 --> 04:13.940
- You need to fix this.
- [inhales deeply]

04:14.030 --> 04:16.240
Sounds like I don't have a
choice, do I?

04:16.820 --> 04:18.700
{\an8}There'll be consequences, <i>amigo.</i>

04:19.610 --> 04:21.690
[stutters] Wait.
What do you mean, consequences?

04:25.240 --> 04:27.570
{\an8}[shuddering] Raphael.

04:29.830 --> 04:31.750
{\an8}How is he? Is he sleeping?

04:32.330 --> 04:35.750
{\an8}Everything is gonna be just
fine, Mrs. Lewis.

04:43.390 --> 04:44.690
{\an8}You holding up okay?

04:45.810 --> 04:48.520
{\an8}I miss her... [sighs] a lot.

04:49.190 --> 04:51.360
{\an8}And then there's Luke.
He's just vanished.

04:51.440 --> 04:53.990
{\an8}Luke'll be fine.
And so will you.

04:54.940 --> 04:56.230
{\an8}It just takes time.

04:57.110 --> 04:58.120
{\an8}How's Alec doing?

04:59.150 --> 05:01.710
{\an8}I can tell he still feels horrible
for what happened to your mom.

05:01.740 --> 05:03.960
{\an8}He can't keep blaming himself.

05:06.290 --> 05:08.710
{\an8}He's strong. He'll heal.

05:09.910 --> 05:11.120
{\an8}I see you've healed.

05:12.540 --> 05:14.410
{\an8}I've never stabbed
a friend before,

05:14.500 --> 05:17.500
{\an8}so I figure I at least
owe you an apology, or...

05:17.590 --> 05:18.640
{\an8}There's no need.

05:18.710 --> 05:20.460
You destroyed that demon.

05:21.380 --> 05:23.170
And besides,
I'm all healed up now.

05:24.260 --> 05:26.380
{\an8}[chuckles] Aldertree
cleared me for mission.

05:28.770 --> 05:31.440
{\an8}Are the Iron Sisters anything
like the Silent Brothers?

05:31.520 --> 05:34.490
{\an8}For starters,
the Sisters' mouths aren't sewn shut.

05:35.310 --> 05:38.440
They're badass warriors who
create all of our weapons.

05:38.530 --> 05:39.820
Wow.

05:40.740 --> 05:42.370
I see why you wanted to be one.

05:42.450 --> 05:45.330
If you're lucky enough to be
accepted into the sisterhood,

05:45.410 --> 05:47.120
you're marked by sacred runes.

05:47.200 --> 05:50.820
It's what allows the Iron
Sisters to shape pure <i>adamas.</i>

06:01.380 --> 06:03.710
The Sisters call upon
the power of the angels

06:03.800 --> 06:05.710
to imbue our blades
with their energy.

06:24.860 --> 06:26.490
I hate to leave you.

06:29.120 --> 06:30.750
Then I guess I have
to come with you.

06:30.830 --> 06:32.880
- Clary, you just lost...
- My mom.

06:32.950 --> 06:35.950
I know. But I...
I can't sit here and mope.

06:36.960 --> 06:40.430
I need to do something...
anything to stop Valentine.

06:40.500 --> 06:43.210
He is the reason
my mother is dead.

06:48.430 --> 06:49.640
[Aldertree] Ah, Isabelle.

06:50.260 --> 06:51.760
A welcome reprieve from work.

06:52.930 --> 06:55.456
Before I move out on mission,
I would like to get a refill for...

06:55.480 --> 06:58.650
<i>Yin fen.</i>
You're using as directed?

06:58.730 --> 07:01.400
Absolutely.
A little goes a long way.

07:07.860 --> 07:09.530
One more thing.

07:09.620 --> 07:11.790
Clary would like to join
the mission to the Citadel.

07:11.870 --> 07:13.250
But she's not trained.

07:13.330 --> 07:14.540
I'll keep an eye on her.

07:15.830 --> 07:17.740
You and Clary have grown close.

07:19.090 --> 07:21.090
But how well do you
really know her?

07:22.920 --> 07:24.380
Pretty well.

07:28.970 --> 07:30.980
She's Valentine's daughter.

07:31.060 --> 07:33.770
And the Clave,
they've expressed their concern

07:33.850 --> 07:36.980
that Valentine may have
experimented on Clary.

07:37.060 --> 07:39.270
Injected her with
demon blood as well.

07:39.360 --> 07:40.610
There's no way.

07:40.690 --> 07:44.320
You grew up with Jace.
Never suspected he had demon blood.

07:45.780 --> 07:48.740
- I will grant your request.
- Mmm.

07:48.820 --> 07:52.570
But I'm gonna need you to report back
to me everything Clary says and does.

07:52.660 --> 07:55.290
You're asking me
to spy on Clary?

08:03.380 --> 08:04.430
[Clary] <i>Wait, what?</i>

08:04.510 --> 08:06.300
You moved your stuff
back to the boat basin?

08:06.380 --> 08:08.540
[Simon] Turns out being a
vampire who only drinks blood

08:08.590 --> 08:10.630
doesn't jive really well
with a Jewish mother

08:10.720 --> 08:13.406
- who's always trying to feed you.
<i>- She doesn't remember you coming home?</i>

08:13.430 --> 08:15.300
Seems a bit much
to wipe her memory.

08:15.390 --> 08:17.600
Yeah. Well, she saw me...

08:17.680 --> 08:20.060
um, in an awkward situation.

08:20.150 --> 08:22.820
- What situation?
<i>- I know I tell you everything,</i>

08:22.900 --> 08:26.160
but in this case, just take my word.
It was bad.

08:26.240 --> 08:28.660
I just wish I was at the
funeral with you instead.

08:28.740 --> 08:31.910
I can't believe the Clave and
their stupid ban on Downworlders.

08:32.659 --> 08:35.500
You should've been able to go.
Luke, too.

08:35.580 --> 08:37.789
<i>He still hasn't called.
I'm worried.</i>

08:37.870 --> 08:40.120
My mom was everything to him.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.559
Maybe I shouldn't go
on this mission...

08:43.630 --> 08:45.260
No, Clary. I'll find Luke.

08:45.340 --> 08:47.470
I'll check with the pack.
See if they have any leads.

08:47.550 --> 08:49.760
<i>- You go with Izzy.</i>
- You're the best.

08:49.840 --> 08:51.510
<i>Bye.</i>

08:53.600 --> 08:55.640
[traditional Chinese
music playing]

08:57.560 --> 09:00.400
- So, that's it? You're giving up on Luke?
- We looked everywhere.

09:00.480 --> 09:03.280
- His trail's gone cold.
- But he's your friend, your pack leader.

09:03.360 --> 09:05.720
Yeah, well, if you find him,
you can remind him of all that.

09:06.780 --> 09:09.586
Lately, Luke's been far more concerned
with Shadowhunters than his own pack.

09:09.610 --> 09:10.610
Wow.

09:11.610 --> 09:13.290
You did not strike me
as the jealous type.

09:13.370 --> 09:16.250
Maybe I'm just getting tired of
you leaving your stink around here.

09:17.200 --> 09:19.780
Alaric, come on.
What if Luke's in real trouble?

09:21.000 --> 09:22.750
He's a wolf.

09:22.830 --> 09:24.910
I'd be far more worried for
whoever crosses his path.

09:27.460 --> 09:28.670
[sighs]

09:46.060 --> 09:48.060
[panting]

09:55.910 --> 09:57.460
[grunting]

09:57.530 --> 09:58.780
[bones cracking]

10:04.120 --> 10:05.540
[snarling]

10:14.930 --> 10:16.560
[Magnus] Good on jam.

10:18.100 --> 10:19.310
Hmm.

10:21.270 --> 10:23.320
- Restock werewolf.
- Magnus.

10:24.230 --> 10:26.360
I got your fire message.
What's the emergency?

10:28.110 --> 10:29.360
- Are those...
- Fangs?

10:29.440 --> 10:32.110
Yes. Very potent.

10:32.190 --> 10:34.020
Good for digestion.

10:37.660 --> 10:39.620
I'm sorry about
the emergency call,

10:39.700 --> 10:42.070
but it was the only way
to get your attention.

10:43.830 --> 10:47.660
Well, since you're okay,
I should probably get back.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.420
I'm not okay...

10:51.800 --> 10:53.510
because you're not okay.

10:54.430 --> 10:55.640
[Magnus sighs]

10:58.140 --> 10:59.310
Alexander...

10:59.970 --> 11:01.550
you've been to hell and back.

11:01.640 --> 11:04.600
And you haven't stopped for a
second, taken a moment for yourself.

11:04.690 --> 11:06.230
Magnus,
we're in the middle of a war.

11:06.310 --> 11:09.310
[sighs] There will
always be a war.

11:09.400 --> 11:11.990
A mission. A...
a problem to solve.

11:12.070 --> 11:14.370
Look, I speak from experience.

11:14.450 --> 11:17.290
If you fail to grant time for
the things you care about,

11:17.360 --> 11:19.900
you'll forget why you're
even fighting at all.

11:25.210 --> 11:27.300
[inhales deeply] What
do you have in mind?

11:29.670 --> 11:31.840
[door opens and slams shut]

11:33.090 --> 11:34.970
I got the hint, Alaric.

11:35.050 --> 11:37.350
This is me leaving.
I'm just about packed.

11:37.430 --> 11:38.950
[Maia] Looks like
you barely moved in.

11:46.310 --> 11:47.650
You sleep in a canoe?

11:47.730 --> 11:48.820
[stammers] Yeah, uh...

11:49.520 --> 11:53.060
I guess it's not exactly Posturepedic,
but it's better than a coffin, though.

11:53.150 --> 11:55.820
Although, I've never really slept in one.
So I wouldn't...

11:55.900 --> 11:57.780
At home I have memory
foam, which I really miss.

11:57.820 --> 12:01.070
It's, uh, developed by NASA,
which I highly recommend.

12:01.160 --> 12:04.330
But you're... you're probably
not in the market for a bed,

12:04.410 --> 12:06.870
so, uh... never mind.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.120
Do you always talk this much?

12:08.160 --> 12:10.250
- When I'm nervous.
- Why would you be nervous?

12:10.330 --> 12:12.290
It's just my natural
disposition, I guess.

12:12.380 --> 12:14.390
- I'm... I'm Simon.
- Maia.

12:14.460 --> 12:16.130
I heard you back
there with Alaric.

12:16.210 --> 12:17.460
How do you know Luke?

12:17.550 --> 12:19.260
Me and Luke go way back.

12:19.340 --> 12:21.210
He's kinda like a dad
to my friend Clary.

12:21.300 --> 12:23.220
He coached my
little league team.

12:23.300 --> 12:26.930
Well, even though the pack stopped
looking for Luke, I haven't.

12:27.980 --> 12:29.320
Really? That's such a relief.

12:29.400 --> 12:30.800
'Cause I could
really use the help.

12:30.850 --> 12:33.440
- Um, we should totally...
- There is no "we."

12:33.520 --> 12:37.110
You know it's too dangerous for a vampire
to hunt a werewolf while he's wolfing out.

12:38.150 --> 12:39.400
When we first Turn,

12:39.490 --> 12:43.160
any stress or emotion can set us off.
Especially sadness.

12:43.240 --> 12:44.700
Like if someone
close to you died.

12:44.790 --> 12:47.460
If Luke's lost control,
he could be out there hurting someone.

12:47.540 --> 12:50.500
No. Luke would never do that.

12:50.580 --> 12:53.120
I mean, can you think of
anywhere he might've gone?

12:53.210 --> 12:54.550
Somewhere removed?

12:54.630 --> 12:56.510
- Away from people?
- I don't know.

12:58.130 --> 12:59.130
We used to go camping.

12:59.840 --> 13:01.050
Here. I'll drive.

13:01.130 --> 13:03.260
- One condition.
- Yeah.

13:03.340 --> 13:05.550
We keep the talking to a minimum.
Yeah?

13:16.400 --> 13:17.610
[Clary gasps]

13:21.700 --> 13:22.700
Whoa.

13:22.780 --> 13:25.740
[Isabelle] This is more
amazing than I imagined.

13:30.120 --> 13:32.620
I can't believe I'm
actually going inside.

13:38.460 --> 13:39.590
[bell tolls]

13:39.670 --> 13:41.380
[high-pitched ringing]

13:45.390 --> 13:46.390
[gasps]

13:49.100 --> 13:50.440
Speak your names.

13:50.520 --> 13:51.940
Isabelle Lightwood.

13:54.900 --> 13:55.900
Clary Fairchild.

13:56.860 --> 13:58.110
Valentine's daughter.

14:00.360 --> 14:02.440
Your father killed
the Silent Brothers.

14:02.530 --> 14:04.790
He's taken our most
valuable weapon.

14:04.870 --> 14:06.330
You must leave immediately.

14:06.410 --> 14:08.540
Clary's done nothing wrong.

14:08.620 --> 14:09.750
[Cleophas] Allow me.

14:10.870 --> 14:12.080
What answers do you seek?

14:12.160 --> 14:15.750
Why did Valentine go to all that
trouble to steal the Soul-Sword?

14:23.220 --> 14:27.480
Yes, Valentine is my father,
but that man killed my mother.

14:27.550 --> 14:29.430
He experimented on my brother.

14:29.520 --> 14:31.310
I want to stop him
more than anyone.

14:31.890 --> 14:34.390
And if we have any chance
at defeating him...

14:35.480 --> 14:36.990
we need your help.

14:46.070 --> 14:49.450
Sister Cleophas,
how long have you been in the order?

14:50.450 --> 14:52.410
Fourteen beautiful years.

14:52.500 --> 14:55.340
I never planned on following
in my mother's footsteps.

14:55.420 --> 14:58.300
I was happy living in Idris
with my sister Amatis,

14:58.380 --> 15:00.880
when my brother Lucian was
scratched in a werewolf attack.

15:02.130 --> 15:04.500
I did what I had to do to
restore our family's honor.

15:04.590 --> 15:05.590
Do you mean Luke?

15:07.140 --> 15:08.850
Are you Luke's sister?

15:12.100 --> 15:13.100
I am.

15:13.810 --> 15:15.770
We must begin the purity trial.

15:15.850 --> 15:17.020
What's that?

15:17.900 --> 15:20.780
For the answers you seek,
we must go inside the Citadel.

15:21.820 --> 15:24.160
But we cannot allow any
demonic impurities to pass.

15:25.240 --> 15:27.040
The <i>adamas</i> is too fragile.

15:27.110 --> 15:31.610
So, the heavenly energy in the water
will help us determine if you may enter.

15:33.200 --> 15:35.990
It will destroy any
contaminant upon contact.

15:39.130 --> 15:41.526
[Aldertree] Your demon blood
makes it impossible to trust you.

15:41.550 --> 15:44.850
So, how about telling me why you and
Clary are studying the Gray Book.

15:46.260 --> 15:47.890
I have eyes everywhere.

15:48.890 --> 15:51.350
What are Valentine's
little children up to?

15:52.220 --> 15:55.220
I was teaching her about
the history of runes.

15:55.310 --> 15:58.480
Last time I checked, educating a
fellow Shadowhunter wasn't a crime.

15:59.520 --> 16:03.310
It's a shame you won't have
much time for tutoring anymore.

16:03.400 --> 16:05.620
I'm placing you on ichor duty.

16:07.610 --> 16:10.530
Do I look like a
first-year grunt to you?

16:11.450 --> 16:13.750
I can have you clean the
latrines if you'd prefer.

16:18.710 --> 16:20.550
[upbeat music playing]

16:24.960 --> 16:26.710
[indistinct chatter]

16:33.600 --> 16:35.980
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome. [Chuckles]

16:37.060 --> 16:38.440
I'm not much of a beer drinker,

16:38.520 --> 16:41.110
but my bartender friend
swears by this IPA.

16:41.190 --> 16:44.700
Oh, well, I'm not much of a drinker,
period, but I'll take your word for it.

16:44.780 --> 16:45.860
Cheers.

16:50.950 --> 16:52.000
You hate it.

16:52.070 --> 16:54.490
No, it's, um... It's great.

16:59.210 --> 17:02.050
You see that?
It's just like archery.

17:02.790 --> 17:06.750
- It's all about the aim, Magnus.
- Who knew there were so many similarities.

17:16.060 --> 17:17.060
[Alec sighs]

17:19.520 --> 17:20.819
Can't win 'em all.

17:26.520 --> 17:28.150
[balls clattering]

17:33.030 --> 17:36.530
- Wait, did you do your... thing?
- Haven't you heard the saying?

17:37.240 --> 17:40.200
"If you can't find the one being
hustled in the pool hall...

17:40.870 --> 17:42.040
then it's probably you."

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
- Okay. Okay?
- Okay. Yeah.

17:47.920 --> 17:48.960
Let's play.

17:59.810 --> 18:01.900
- Who's Clary?
- Hmm?

18:03.140 --> 18:04.560
Luke's kind of daughter?

18:04.650 --> 18:05.900
Oh, Clary, um...

18:05.980 --> 18:09.400
We met in first grade.
Miss Hiddleston's art class.

18:09.480 --> 18:12.520
She ran to get the nurse when I
had an allergic reaction to clay.

18:12.610 --> 18:15.280
So, naturally,
we've been best friends ever since.

18:16.070 --> 18:17.900
- Best friends, huh?
- Mmm-hmm.

18:17.990 --> 18:19.410
There some other guy she's into?

18:20.250 --> 18:24.000
Well, I mean...
she was into this one guy, Jace,

18:24.080 --> 18:25.950
but it's kind of a long story.

18:26.040 --> 18:27.580
Jace Wayland?

18:27.670 --> 18:29.220
You know him?

18:30.300 --> 18:32.140
I kind of tried to kill him.

18:34.510 --> 18:36.770
- Really?
- Yeah, typical Shadowhunter.

18:36.850 --> 18:38.230
They act like
they're our allies,

18:38.300 --> 18:41.196
but really, they don't know what we go
through just to get through the day.

18:41.220 --> 18:42.470
Tell me about it.

18:42.560 --> 18:46.070
You know, and just when I thought I
was starting to get the hang of... it,

18:46.150 --> 18:49.360
I sank to the all...
all-time low.

18:49.440 --> 18:50.440
What happened?

18:53.950 --> 18:55.870
Oh, now you're quiet?

18:55.950 --> 18:57.790
[chuckles]

18:57.870 --> 19:01.460
Look, man, I've been through some pretty
horrible things myself, so I get it.

19:03.290 --> 19:04.840
Like what?

19:05.920 --> 19:07.050
Uh...

19:08.790 --> 19:11.170
Okay, I've actually never
told anyone this, but, um...

19:11.840 --> 19:15.010
You know that nightmare you have
about showing up to school naked?

19:15.090 --> 19:16.340
Mmm-hmm. [Chuckles]

19:16.430 --> 19:20.350
Well, after an unexpected
transformation... [chuckles]

19:20.430 --> 19:24.470
I came out of it butt naked
and late for calculus.

19:25.190 --> 19:26.360
No.

19:26.440 --> 19:28.230
- [both laughing]
- It was horrible.

19:28.310 --> 19:30.310
What did you do?

19:30.400 --> 19:33.570
[stammers] I hid in an empty
classroom until everybody left,

19:33.650 --> 19:38.360
and, luckily,
I found a band uniform to wear,

19:38.450 --> 19:44.000
but, in hindsight, it probably would've
been less embarrassing to just be naked.

19:44.080 --> 19:45.130
[both laugh]

19:45.210 --> 19:46.460
Okay.

19:47.540 --> 19:48.870
I will raise you one.

19:52.460 --> 19:56.000
I was holed up at home with...
with nothing to feed on.

19:56.090 --> 19:57.500
No food.

19:58.130 --> 20:01.470
And we've been having, like, a...
a rodent problem lately.

20:02.470 --> 20:04.260
- You didn't.
- Oh, yeah. I did.

20:04.350 --> 20:07.480
My mom walked in on me just
sucking the blood out of a rat.

20:07.560 --> 20:09.430
[laughing] That's so vile.

20:09.520 --> 20:10.680
Munching down. [Chuckling]

20:12.190 --> 20:14.940
Yuck, but it could be worse.

20:15.030 --> 20:18.200
You could've been
sucking on a rat naked.

20:18.280 --> 20:19.620
[both laughing]

20:26.250 --> 20:28.250
[upbeat music playing]

20:30.630 --> 20:34.430
I suppose we both have a healthy
dose of the competitive spirit.

20:34.500 --> 20:35.580
I grew up with Jace.

20:36.420 --> 20:39.710
- I didn't have much of a choice.
- Some people can't be around that energy.

20:39.800 --> 20:44.720
I, in turn, find it invigorating,
as I'm sure your exes did as well.

20:45.640 --> 20:46.800
Lydia never complained.

20:46.890 --> 20:49.970
I thought you knew Lydia for a
millisecond before your arranged marriage.

20:54.230 --> 20:55.230
Wait.

20:55.860 --> 20:56.870
Lydia...

20:57.690 --> 20:59.110
Is she your only ex?

20:59.200 --> 21:01.330
I just haven't had, uh...

21:02.490 --> 21:05.320
you know,
time for a real relationship.

21:06.740 --> 21:07.740
You know...

21:08.620 --> 21:11.120
This is... This is good.

21:13.540 --> 21:14.920
Alexander...

21:15.000 --> 21:16.670
just so I'm clear...

21:17.960 --> 21:20.420
have you ever been
in a relationship?

21:29.640 --> 21:32.310
[Isabelle] Clary, you can't do this.
[Clary] Why not?

21:32.400 --> 21:34.650
You heard her. It's dangerous.

21:35.230 --> 21:38.190
The water only affects demonic energy.
We'll be fine.

21:38.280 --> 21:39.660
But what if it's not fine?

21:40.530 --> 21:43.160
You think I have demon blood.
Like Jace.

21:44.200 --> 21:45.410
[scoffs]

21:46.240 --> 21:48.450
There's only one
way to find out.

22:06.930 --> 22:09.180
<i>Ignis aurum probat.</i>

22:21.780 --> 22:23.160
Clary Fairchild...

22:24.160 --> 22:27.160
you are deemed clear of
all demonic impurities.

22:43.340 --> 22:45.840
<i>Ignis aurum probat.</i>

22:56.440 --> 22:57.530
[gasps]

22:57.610 --> 22:58.780
Izzy! No!

23:04.900 --> 23:06.690
[Clary] Give me your hand.

23:07.820 --> 23:09.450
- [Isabelle gasping]
- Come on!

23:13.330 --> 23:15.250
- [panting]
- Izzy, are you okay?

23:15.330 --> 23:17.620
- What happened?
- I have no idea.

23:17.710 --> 23:19.190
[Magdalena] The
water does not lie...

23:19.840 --> 23:21.010
but perhaps you do.

23:21.090 --> 23:23.010
I don't know what
you're talking about.

23:23.090 --> 23:26.350
- You are tainted with demonic impurities.
- I'm sorry, Isabelle.

23:26.430 --> 23:28.220
We can't let you
inside the Citadel.

23:29.050 --> 23:30.340
No, this has to be a mistake.

23:30.430 --> 23:33.930
She had a demon wound,
maybe that's what the water reacted to.

23:34.020 --> 23:36.070
But she's fine now.
She's healed.

23:36.140 --> 23:38.680
You are free to leave,
if that is what you desire.

23:38.770 --> 23:40.020
[panting] No.

23:41.270 --> 23:44.520
You go ahead. We need answers.

23:53.740 --> 23:55.950
[Magdalena] Your friend has no
idea, does she?

23:56.750 --> 23:58.710
<i>Yin fen</i> permeates your body.

23:58.790 --> 24:00.750
Vampire venom churns
through your veins.

24:01.750 --> 24:02.750
What?

24:04.000 --> 24:07.500
You didn't know?
<i>Yin fen</i> is made from vampire venom.

24:07.590 --> 24:10.510
I was injured. It was given
to me so I could heal quickly.

24:11.430 --> 24:12.940
<i>Yin fen</i> will not heal you.

24:15.230 --> 24:16.610
Be careful.

24:21.940 --> 24:24.910
[Maia] Full disclosure, I'd rather
be hunting in the woods of <i>Far Cry 3.</i>

24:26.240 --> 24:27.780
Really?

24:27.860 --> 24:30.490
I just never would have
pegged you for a gamer.

24:31.620 --> 24:34.210
[Maia] When I first Turned,
I'd spend hours playing video games.

24:34.290 --> 24:37.460
- Just me and endless bags of potato chips.
- [Simon chuckles]

24:37.540 --> 24:40.130
I was terrified to go out.

24:40.210 --> 24:43.840
Afraid that I would hurt someone.
That I wouldn't be able to control myself.

24:47.300 --> 24:51.640
Well, you seem very in control now.
At least, as far as I can tell.

24:51.720 --> 24:53.430
Yeah, well, thank Luke for that.

25:04.110 --> 25:05.610
It's Maia, right?

25:06.730 --> 25:08.650
You're gonna be okay.

25:11.110 --> 25:12.940
Probably just going
through shock.

25:15.080 --> 25:16.460
How about I sit right here?

25:16.540 --> 25:18.130
Ride with you to the hospital?

25:18.200 --> 25:20.910
What am I gonna say, "No"?
You're a cop.

25:26.340 --> 25:28.220
I gather you're not a
big fan of the police.

25:28.300 --> 25:30.470
Probably met a few who
abused their power.

25:30.550 --> 25:32.130
Well, I'm not like them.

25:32.970 --> 25:35.310
- I know what you're going through.
- How?

25:35.390 --> 25:37.140
I don't even know what
I'm going through.

25:39.890 --> 25:42.520
The last thing I remember,
there was this girl...

25:43.900 --> 25:45.070
and...

25:47.230 --> 25:48.810
[cries] Oh, God.

25:50.200 --> 25:53.160
- Did I?
- No, no. She... she'll live.

25:53.240 --> 25:55.040
We just have to watch her.

25:56.030 --> 25:57.200
Make sure she doesn't Turn.

25:58.080 --> 26:00.080
Turn?
What are you talking about?

26:05.920 --> 26:07.170
Are you...

26:09.130 --> 26:10.140
Am I?

26:10.220 --> 26:11.760
Yes.

26:14.050 --> 26:16.340
No, no. This isn't happening.
[Crying]

26:16.430 --> 26:18.690
Maia. Maia, calm down.
You have to control yourself.

26:19.520 --> 26:21.400
Our changes are
linked to our emotion.

26:23.140 --> 26:25.180
Now, you don't wanna hurt
anybody else, do you?

26:25.860 --> 26:27.950
- No.
- Okay.

26:28.020 --> 26:29.140
[crying]

26:36.240 --> 26:39.530
The first time...
that's always the worst.

26:39.620 --> 26:41.830
But you learn to control it.

26:41.910 --> 26:43.950
You just can't give
in to yourself.

26:45.120 --> 26:46.500
You gotta fight.

26:48.090 --> 26:51.640
And those who care about you...
they'll fight with you.

26:53.550 --> 26:56.180
I don't have anyone
that cares about me.

26:58.140 --> 26:59.730
You do now.

27:07.360 --> 27:09.740
- You smell that?
- Blood.

27:09.820 --> 27:10.820
This way.

27:17.370 --> 27:19.620
- Oh, no. Are... are those...
- Claw marks.

27:22.410 --> 27:24.620
[mellow music playing]

27:26.500 --> 27:28.300
- You're weirded out.
- Mmm.

27:29.380 --> 27:31.090
Who says I'm weirded out?

27:34.010 --> 27:36.720
You wanna know why I haven't
been in a relationship?

27:36.800 --> 27:37.840
Because of this.

27:37.930 --> 27:41.270
'Cause... I didn't wanna feel like
there was something wrong with me,

27:41.350 --> 27:44.190
[stammers] because I grew up
in the Institute, because...

27:45.140 --> 27:46.940
I always knew I couldn't
have what I wanted...

27:50.650 --> 27:52.280
until you came along.

27:56.070 --> 27:57.570
Nothing's wrong with you.

27:58.240 --> 27:59.700
Far from it.

28:02.120 --> 28:03.620
But you're so...

28:05.200 --> 28:06.240
innocent.

28:06.330 --> 28:08.040
In some ways, but...

28:09.540 --> 28:12.370
I don't want you to
treat me any different.

28:12.460 --> 28:14.040
But you are different.

28:14.130 --> 28:15.430
And it's a good thing.

28:18.010 --> 28:21.560
What about you?
I mean, you must have had plenty of exes.

28:22.890 --> 28:23.940
What do you mean?

28:25.770 --> 28:27.020
You know what I mean.

28:28.020 --> 28:32.070
Alexander, look,
I've lived for centuries.

28:32.150 --> 28:35.450
I've been with men, women,
Seelies, warlocks, vampires...

28:36.150 --> 28:38.270
- a djinn or two.
- How many?

28:42.160 --> 28:44.830
- How many?
- It's not a trick question.

28:44.910 --> 28:47.530
- You can round down if you want.
- Okay.

28:48.620 --> 28:50.580
If you wanna know,
I'll tell you.

28:52.290 --> 28:53.410
Seventeen.

28:57.210 --> 28:58.540
Seventeen.

28:59.760 --> 29:02.270
That... that's...

29:07.390 --> 29:10.010
Seventeen... hundred?

29:12.230 --> 29:14.740
- Seventeen thousand?
- It was all in the past.

29:14.820 --> 29:16.450
[chuckles] Ancient history.

29:17.440 --> 29:20.440
But right now I'm here.
With you.

29:20.530 --> 29:25.530
Yeah, me and...
17,000 other memories.

29:26.740 --> 29:28.030
Look...

29:29.080 --> 29:30.710
I am who I am.

29:30.790 --> 29:33.000
And you are who you are.

29:33.080 --> 29:35.040
And all the magic in the
world can't change that.

29:35.130 --> 29:38.470
So... let's just try
to make the best of it.

29:42.510 --> 29:44.050
[sighs heavily]

29:45.930 --> 29:47.090
Sure.

30:15.250 --> 30:16.250
[man] Make it shine.

30:18.920 --> 30:21.026
I at least thought you'd last
till the end of your shift.

30:21.050 --> 30:22.350
Why are you doing this to me?

30:22.430 --> 30:24.350
I proved that I wasn't
in league with Valentine,

30:24.430 --> 30:25.906
but you're still
treating me like I was.

30:25.930 --> 30:28.230
And everyone else here is
questioning my allegiance.

30:28.310 --> 30:29.310
As they should.

30:31.350 --> 30:33.600
- [beeps]
- [Aldertree on video] <i>Final question.</i>

30:34.440 --> 30:37.280
<i>Can you pledge your unconditional
loyalty to the Clave?</i>

30:37.360 --> 30:38.860
Facilis descensus Averno.

30:38.940 --> 30:40.980
- [Aldertree] <i>I asked you a question.</i>
- Turn it off.

30:41.860 --> 30:42.860
[beeps]

30:44.280 --> 30:45.910
[sighs]

30:47.580 --> 30:49.120
What do you want from me?

30:51.370 --> 30:54.080
It's my job to make sure our
Shadowhunters are protected.

30:54.160 --> 30:57.660
To do that,
they must know the truth about you.

31:01.760 --> 31:03.890
You want me to leave.

31:03.970 --> 31:05.736
But you don't have the
authority to kick me out,

31:05.760 --> 31:07.050
so you're making my life hell.

31:07.140 --> 31:11.810
And now you're trying to sabotage
any shred of credibility I have left?

31:15.020 --> 31:16.820
If you choose to stay,

31:16.900 --> 31:21.030
I'll have no other choice but to show
everyone who they're living with.

31:21.110 --> 31:23.030
Who they're fighting alongside.

31:24.860 --> 31:25.940
[sighs]

31:45.630 --> 31:49.210
[Clary] Sister Cleophas,
I don't wanna scare you, but I'm worried.

31:50.180 --> 31:51.770
- It's Luke.
- [Cleophas] Lucian?

31:52.350 --> 31:55.110
He's the closest thing
I've ever had to a father.

31:55.180 --> 31:57.850
- But since my mother died...
- Jocelyn.

31:59.100 --> 32:00.520
I'm so sorry for your loss.

32:01.690 --> 32:04.350
Since then...
Luke has gone missing.

32:04.440 --> 32:07.190
He's not returning calls.
He's not showing up to work.

32:07.280 --> 32:10.370
No one has seen
or heard from him.

32:10.450 --> 32:11.460
He did love her.

32:11.530 --> 32:14.160
Lucian always had a
strong sense of loyalty.

32:14.240 --> 32:16.740
Almost to his detriment.

32:16.830 --> 32:19.910
My sweet girl,
I fear you are right.

32:21.090 --> 32:22.550
My brother is in danger,

32:22.630 --> 32:24.510
but not for the
reasons you think.

32:25.130 --> 32:26.460
What kind of danger?

32:35.100 --> 32:38.690
[Cleophas] Long ago, the Angel Raziel
bestowed the Mortal Instruments

32:38.770 --> 32:40.070
to the first Shadowhunter.

32:40.150 --> 32:42.150
Among them, the Soul-Sword.

32:42.900 --> 32:45.570
Its primary purpose is
to compel the truth,

32:45.650 --> 32:47.440
but it has a secondary purpose.

32:48.280 --> 32:51.330
If ever the day came where Shadowhunters
failed in their holy mission,

32:51.410 --> 32:53.210
and demons overtook the world...

32:58.460 --> 33:00.500
- [mouthing] Oh, my God.
- As a last resort,

33:00.580 --> 33:02.500
the Sword could be activated
with angelic energy,

33:02.590 --> 33:06.800
releasing heavenly light that will destroy
demon-blooded creatures in its path.

33:06.880 --> 33:08.250
[Clary] Oh, my God.

33:09.800 --> 33:11.550
Demon-blooded creatures.

33:12.890 --> 33:16.020
- Does that mean...
- Downworlders. Yes.

33:23.900 --> 33:25.860
[straining]

33:28.070 --> 33:30.580
- [bones cracking]
- [grunting]

33:36.700 --> 33:37.700
[grunting]

33:37.790 --> 33:39.580
[woman giggling]

33:43.960 --> 33:44.970
Did you hear that?

33:45.040 --> 33:46.500
[growling]

33:48.510 --> 33:50.100
It's probably just a deer.

33:51.590 --> 33:52.840
Mmm.

33:53.680 --> 33:55.230
[Luke growling]

33:57.930 --> 34:00.850
Luke, no! Don't do it.

34:07.820 --> 34:09.699
[Maia] Simon! [Simon] Stay back.
I got this.

34:09.780 --> 34:11.659
[gasps] Uh,
doesn't look like it.

34:11.739 --> 34:13.659
- [woman] Who's out there?
- Stay in the tent.

34:13.739 --> 34:14.909
[snarling]

34:16.030 --> 34:18.320
Luke, it's me.

34:18.409 --> 34:21.239
Simon.
The guy you taught to shave.

34:21.330 --> 34:23.370
Go with the grain, right?

34:23.460 --> 34:25.010
[growling softly]

34:25.580 --> 34:26.580
Remember?

34:26.670 --> 34:29.050
When we were kids, Clary and
I, you brought us here.

34:29.130 --> 34:31.600
We roasted marshmallows.

34:31.670 --> 34:34.760
Clary got one stuck in her hair. And...
and Jocelyn had to cut it out.

34:35.760 --> 34:37.469
Yeah?

34:37.550 --> 34:40.300
Clary cried, like,
the whole way home

34:40.389 --> 34:44.219
because she thought she looked like a boy.
But you told her that...

34:44.310 --> 34:45.980
she was still beautiful,

34:46.940 --> 34:48.989
and that you would
always love her.

34:50.940 --> 34:52.060
Yeah.

34:57.870 --> 35:00.000
[breathing heavily]

35:03.790 --> 35:05.550
The Sword needs angelic energy?

35:05.620 --> 35:08.000
To activate the Sword,
it must wielded by an angelic being,

35:08.090 --> 35:09.226
and struck by a
bolt of lightning.

35:09.250 --> 35:13.540
Then it's capable of mass murder.
Of killing my friends, my family.

35:14.800 --> 35:18.050
If Valentine does activate the
Sword, how do we turn it off?

35:18.140 --> 35:19.730
It is impossible.

35:19.810 --> 35:22.410
So there has to be a way to stop
Valentine before he activates it.

35:22.470 --> 35:23.800
I can't lose Luke, too.

35:23.890 --> 35:26.130
You mustn't let the Downworld
know what the Sword can do.

35:26.560 --> 35:28.230
Panic and chaos could ensue.

35:28.310 --> 35:31.770
Uprisings.
We cannot let that happen.

35:47.290 --> 35:50.250
[Clary] Sister Cleophas,
I need to ask you something.

35:51.340 --> 35:54.260
When my mother died,
I was given a message.

35:54.340 --> 35:55.810
An image of a rune.

35:55.880 --> 35:58.090
- What kind of rune?
- [Clary] I don't know.

35:58.180 --> 36:00.026
- It's not in the Gray Book.
- I need you to show me.

36:00.050 --> 36:01.470
- Can you do that?
- Yeah.

36:21.490 --> 36:23.910
Do you think it's possible
my mother sent it?

36:24.620 --> 36:25.670
As an angel?

36:27.500 --> 36:30.710
[Cleophas] Jocelyn
was kind and loving.

36:30.790 --> 36:32.290
And an angel to you, perhaps.

36:33.130 --> 36:36.260
But no, she's not an
angel in the Shadow World.

36:36.340 --> 36:40.090
Our angels are beloved
winged celestial beings.

36:42.510 --> 36:45.970
So... what about my mom?

36:47.480 --> 36:49.400
What happens to her?

36:49.480 --> 36:53.240
That, my dear, has always been as
much a mystery to Shadowhunters

36:53.320 --> 36:54.950
as it is to mundanes.

36:58.030 --> 37:02.160
When I heard Jocelyn died,
I've never felt pain like that.

37:03.030 --> 37:05.360
Not since my family disowned me.

37:05.450 --> 37:06.820
That's why I came up here.

37:09.040 --> 37:10.170
So nobody would get hurt.

37:10.250 --> 37:12.130
- Nobody got hurt.
- Barely.

37:12.210 --> 37:14.050
Luke, that wasn't you.

37:15.550 --> 37:17.140
That was the grief.

37:18.630 --> 37:20.800
[inhales shakily]
She's really gone.

37:20.890 --> 37:22.180
But we're here.

37:23.550 --> 37:26.550
Please come back with us.
We need you.

37:26.640 --> 37:28.180
Clary needs you.

37:28.270 --> 37:30.480
You think that I don't
wanna be there for Clary?

37:30.560 --> 37:32.100
For all of you?

37:32.190 --> 37:34.190
But what use am I if I
can't control myself?

37:36.780 --> 37:38.450
Luke, you've gotta fight.

37:41.490 --> 37:44.040
And those that care about
you will fight with you.

37:56.670 --> 37:58.830
For a guy so used to Portals,

37:58.920 --> 38:02.920
I have to admit, nothing beats a
late night stroll through the city.

38:03.010 --> 38:06.050
Yeah. Gives you time to think.

38:07.430 --> 38:09.090
You must have thought a lot.

38:09.180 --> 38:10.350
[Alec sighs]

38:10.430 --> 38:12.310
You barely said a word
the whole way home.

38:17.190 --> 38:18.190
Magnus...

38:20.280 --> 38:24.910
- Do you think... maybe we're too...
- Different?

38:26.030 --> 38:28.280
[sighs] Yeah.

38:32.710 --> 38:35.630
We're from totally
different worlds.

38:37.250 --> 38:39.790
Different centuries.

38:44.380 --> 38:47.260
Look, I... I should go.

38:56.400 --> 38:57.400
[sighs]

39:02.150 --> 39:04.360
Look, I don't care how many
people you've been with.

39:05.910 --> 39:07.000
[sighs]

39:08.120 --> 39:10.670
I don't care how many people
you haven't been with.

39:27.300 --> 39:32.800
I hear that relationships, they, um...
take effort.

39:35.440 --> 39:36.650
I'm all for effort.

39:39.360 --> 39:40.530
[door closes]

39:42.990 --> 39:44.570
Sorry for killing the mood.

39:47.110 --> 39:48.820
You got a spare room?

39:51.700 --> 39:53.976
I just can't believe how close
I came to being Luke's dinner.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.300
A wolf that size,
more like an hors d'oeuvre.

39:56.370 --> 39:58.830
[both chuckling]

39:58.920 --> 40:01.720
[sighs] Man,
I miss hors d'oeuvres.

40:01.800 --> 40:04.760
Oh... I miss chocolate.

40:05.380 --> 40:07.840
Ever since I Turned,
it makes me puke.

40:07.930 --> 40:10.140
- That's awful.
- [both chuckling]

40:11.850 --> 40:13.480
Simon...

40:13.560 --> 40:18.280
what you did back there, with Luke,
that was, like, seriously inspiring.

40:19.350 --> 40:22.350
Really? I... I don't think I've
ever inspired anyone before.

40:23.320 --> 40:26.240
- [Maia] I'm sure you have.
- No, no.

40:26.320 --> 40:28.820
Almost came to me, but just...
just ran right away.

40:28.910 --> 40:31.540
[Maia laughing] Oh,
come on, come on.

40:31.620 --> 40:33.766
[Simon] What? Okay, how would I
have inspired someone, tell me.

40:33.790 --> 40:35.540
[Luke] Hey, kiddo.

40:35.620 --> 40:36.830
Hey.

40:36.910 --> 40:39.040
Simon called me
when he found you.

40:39.960 --> 40:41.550
I am so sorry I
wasn't there for you.

40:42.590 --> 40:45.140
You're here now.
That's all that matters.

40:58.190 --> 41:00.820
- Clary doesn't have demon blood.
- You're sure?

41:00.900 --> 41:04.740
There was a purity trial.
She passed with flying colors.

41:04.820 --> 41:06.160
A purity trial?

41:08.070 --> 41:10.570
- How did you fare?
- I almost died!

41:10.660 --> 41:13.370
I'm sorry, Isabelle.
I had no idea there'd be a purity trial,

41:13.450 --> 41:15.926
- otherwise I never would have sent you.
- How can I believe you?

41:15.950 --> 41:17.870
I wanted you to heal.

41:17.950 --> 41:19.726
So you could go on mission
to the Iron Sisters,

41:19.750 --> 41:22.010
just like you wanted
so desperately.

41:22.080 --> 41:24.040
I would never
cause you any harm.

41:24.130 --> 41:27.470
But if you don't want any
more, I understand. It's...

41:27.550 --> 41:28.680
Wait.

41:34.850 --> 41:36.440
All I ever wanted
was to help you.

41:36.520 --> 41:38.110
But now,
I'm going to need your help.

41:40.100 --> 41:43.390
If there's anything you
neglected to tell me,

41:43.480 --> 41:46.690
anything about Clary
Fairchild, I need to know.

41:52.530 --> 41:54.440
I've told you everything I know.

41:58.580 --> 42:00.000
Sister Cleophas, wait!

42:00.080 --> 42:01.750
Return to the Citadel.

42:01.830 --> 42:03.450
You never saw me.
Do you understand?

42:03.540 --> 42:04.750
I cannot do that.

42:04.830 --> 42:06.370
I thought this was
all behind you.

42:06.960 --> 42:10.380
Cleophas, please. Stay.
