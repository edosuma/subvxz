15:54.787 --> 15:55.996
IT'S OKAY NOW.

15:55.996 --> 15:57.957
THE NURSE
GAVE HER MEDICATION.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.124
WHAT'S THE DOCTOR SAY?

15:59.124 --> 16:02.461

WAITING ON A CAST.

16:06.048 --> 16:07.758

16:07.758 --> 16:09.927
I CAME HOME
FROM THE GROCERY,

16:09.927 --> 16:11.762
AND I HAD JUST GOT
THE DOOR OPEN

16:11.762 --> 16:13.681
WHEN I FELT
A SHOVE FROM BEHIND.

16:13.681 --> 16:15.265
HE MUST HAVE BEEN WAITING
IN THE ALCOVE

16:15.265 --> 16:17.142
WHERE THE SUPER
WON'T FIX THE LIGHT.

16:17.142 --> 16:19.269
HE PINNED ME ON THE GROUND

16:19.269 --> 16:22.147
AND THEN HE STARTED
PUNCHING AND PUNCHING.

16:22.147 --> 16:24.608
WAS THERE ANYTHING ABOUT HIM
YOU COULD RECOGNIZE?

16:24.608 --> 16:26.276
A TATTOO OR A SCAR?

16:26.276 --> 16:28.153
IT HAPPENED SO FAST, ANTONIO.

16:28.153 --> 16:30.030
DID HE SAY ANYTHING?

16:30.030 --> 16:33.951
HE SAID HE WAS GOING
TO RAPE ME AND THEN KILL ME,

16:33.951 --> 16:36.662
BUT I SCREAMED
AND I SCRATCHED AT HIM

16:36.662 --> 16:38.163
UNTIL HE WENT AWAY.

16:39.540 --> 16:41.458
WHO WOULD DO THIS,
ANTONIO?

16:41.458 --> 16:43.210
SOMEONE WHO'S GOING
TO GET TAKEN CARE OF.

16:43.210 --> 16:46.088
DON'T GET YOURSELF HURT
ON ACCOUNT OF ME, ANTONIO.

16:46.088 --> 16:48.340
JUST --
MAMA, JUST RELAX, OKAY?

16:51.010 --> 16:52.594
DON'T WORRY ABOUT A THING.

THIS MORNING FROM THE SHOOTING.

17:05.524 --> 17:06.734

17:06.734 --> 17:08.819
YOU KNOW A GUY
NAMED MARK LERNER?

17:08.819 --> 17:10.487
YES.

17:10.487 --> 17:11.989
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW HIM?

17:11.989 --> 17:13.824
LAST WEEK, I GUESS. WHY?

17:13.824 --> 17:15.409
HOW ARE THINGS
BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU?

17:15.409 --> 17:17.453
PRETTY STEADY
OR A LOT OF DUSTUPS?

17:17.453 --> 17:19.288
WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?

17:19.288 --> 17:20.914
WERE YOU AND MARK LOVERS?

17:20.914 --> 17:22.666
GREAT. THIS IS JUST GREAT.

17:22.666 --> 17:24.293
DO I NEED AN ATTORNEY
OR SOMETHING?

17:24.293 --> 17:26.295
WHY WOULD YOU NEED
AN ATTORNEY?

17:26.295 --> 17:27.713
I JUST DON'T FEEL
LIKE GOING TO JAIL

17:27.713 --> 17:29.256
FOR SOMETHING I HAD
NOTHING TO DO WITH.

17:29.256 --> 17:31.633
THEN JUST TELL
THE TRUTH, DONNA.

17:31.633 --> 17:33.719
WE'LL DO OUR BEST
TO KEEP YOU OUT OF JAIL.

17:36.055 --> 17:37.973
WE WERE LOVERS.
HE BROKE IT OFF.

17:37.973 --> 17:39.308
Sipowicz: WHEN?

17:39.308 --> 17:41.935
TWO WEEKS AGO,
BUT NO MATTER WHAT HE SAYS,

17:41.935 --> 17:43.312
I AM NOT A STALKER
OR A VANDAL.

17:43.312 --> 17:45.105
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
HE'S CALLING YOU THAT?

17:45.105 --> 17:47.691
WHY ELSE WOULD I BE HERE?

17:47.691 --> 17:49.610
HE RUNS OVER A NAIL,

17:49.610 --> 17:52.780
AND SUDDENLY I'M GLENN CLOSE,
I'M GOING TO BOIL HIS RABBIT.

17:52.780 --> 17:55.449
I'M STUDYING
TO BE A NEWS PERSONALITY.

17:55.449 --> 17:57.826
I'M NOT A TIRE SLASHER.

17:57.826 --> 17:58.952
MARK GOT A NAIL
IN HIS TIRE,

17:58.952 --> 18:00.496
AND HE THINKS
YOU PUT IT THERE?

18:00.496 --> 18:02.164
THE DAY
AFTER HE CALLED IT OFF,

18:02.164 --> 18:03.540
HE GOT A FLAT.

18:03.540 --> 18:05.125
IT WAS A COINCIDENCE.

18:05.125 --> 18:08.962
DO YOU KNOW
WHERE MARK IS NOW, DONNA?

18:08.962 --> 18:11.048
TEACHING
EXPERIMENTAL AMERICAN LIT?

18:11.048 --> 18:12.132
NO.

18:12.132 --> 18:13.842
HE WAS SHOT
THIS AFTERNOON.

18:13.842 --> 18:15.302
WHAT?

18:15.302 --> 18:16.637
IS HE ALL RIGHT?

18:16.637 --> 18:17.846
HE DIDN'T MAKE IT.

18:17.846 --> 18:20.307
SO LET'S TALK
A LITTLE MORE

18:20.307 --> 18:22.518
ABOUT HIM WANTING
TO BREAK THINGS OFF.

18:22.518 --> 18:24.853
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

18:24.853 --> 18:26.021
HE'S DEAD?

18:26.021 --> 18:28.357
WHERE WERE YOU
AROUND 11:30 THIS MORNING?

18:28.357 --> 18:31.360
I-I DON'T KNOW.

18:31.360 --> 18:32.778
HE'S REALLY DEAD?

18:32.778 --> 18:34.029
YEAH, HE'S REALLY DEAD,

18:34.029 --> 18:35.656
AND YOU'RE NOT
EXPLAINING YOUR WHEREABOUTS.

18:35.656 --> 18:39.493
11:30, I WAS AT MY
ELECTIVE AT SUNY --

18:39.493 --> 18:40.911

18:40.911 --> 18:43.038
PEOPLE SAW YOU THERE?

18:43.038 --> 18:44.706
DID YOU EVER MENTION
YOUR RELATIONSHIP TROUBLES

18:44.706 --> 18:48.127
TO ANYONE ELSE --
MAYBE SOMEONE WITH A GUN?

18:48.127 --> 18:50.254
I DON'T KNOW
ANYONE WITH A GUN.

18:50.254 --> 18:52.589
HOW ABOUT SOMEONE
WHO MIGHT TAKE INITIATIVE,

18:52.589 --> 18:55.092
MAYBE SOMEONE WHO WAS LOOKING
TO GET IN YOUR GOOD GRACES?

18:55.092 --> 18:57.386
YOU THINK I HAD SOMETHING
TO DO WITH THIS?

18:57.386 --> 18:59.388
I LOVED HIM.

18:59.388 --> 19:00.848
I WOULDN'T HURT HIM,

19:00.848 --> 19:02.099
AND I DON'T
KNOW ANYONE WHO WOULD,

19:02.099 --> 19:03.475
OR ANYONE WITH A GUN,

19:03.475 --> 19:05.894
OR ANYONE WHO'S CAPABLE
OF KILLING SOMEONE.

19:05.894 --> 19:09.356
I'VE NEVER EVEN MET
ANYONE LIKE THAT...

19:09.356 --> 19:10.649
EXCEPT FOR YOU.

19:16.071 --> 19:17.823
LIEUTENANT, HOW'S YOUR MOM?

19:17.823 --> 19:19.867
SHE'S FINE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

19:19.867 --> 19:21.660

FROM THE APARTMENT.

19:21.660 --> 19:22.786
WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL ME?

19:22.786 --> 19:24.246
I WAS IN THE AREA.

19:24.246 --> 19:26.623
"UP TO THE SECOND"
MEANS "UP TO THE SECOND,"

19:26.623 --> 19:29.001
NOT "I GOT INFORMATION,
NOW I'M GOING TO SIT ON IT."

19:31.670 --> 19:33.297

TWO MONTHS, AND I HEAR --

19:37.259 --> 19:38.594
DID YOU BRING HIM IN?

19:38.594 --> 19:40.012
NO, WE CAN'T FIND HIM.

19:40.012 --> 19:41.138
DID YOU CHECK
HIS ADDRESSES?

19:41.138 --> 19:42.264
THEY'RE BOGUS OR OLD.

19:42.264 --> 19:44.349
WHAT ABOUT THE NUMBERS
HE CALLED

19:44.349 --> 19:45.142
AFTER HIS COLLARS?

19:45.142 --> 19:46.894
MOST HAVE BEEN CHECKED.
WE GOT NOTHING.

19:46.894 --> 19:50.063
SO YOU WASTE TIME
TO BRING ME THE NAME OF A GHOST?

19:50.063 --> 19:52.357
I WANTED TO KNOW
IF THE PHOTO RANG ANY BELLS

19:52.357 --> 19:53.734
ON WHERE TO LOOK FOR HIM,
SEEING HOW IT WAS YOU

19:53.734 --> 19:55.527
THAT PUT HIM AWAY
EIGHT YEARS AGO.

19:58.989 --> 20:01.658
I'M TOLD HE USED TO
DYE HIS HAIR BLOND,

20:01.658 --> 20:03.869
CALL HIMSELF KIKI.

20:03.869 --> 20:06.079
SON OF A BITCH.

20:06.079 --> 20:07.789
WHAT'D HE DO?

20:07.789 --> 20:10.542
BIG-WEIGHT TRAFFICKER.

20:10.542 --> 20:12.461
AND HE DID
AT LEAST TWO HOMICIDES,

20:12.461 --> 20:14.087
BUT HE BEAT THEM AT TRIAL.

20:14.087 --> 20:16.757
DID HE GIVE YOU A HARD TIME
AFTER THE COLLAR?

20:16.757 --> 20:20.552
DIDN'T SEEM ANY MORE
THAN USUAL AT THE TIME.

20:20.552 --> 20:22.554
BUT I GOT CLOSE
TO THIS GUY.

20:22.554 --> 20:24.056
I SPENT A YEAR WITH HIM.

20:24.056 --> 20:27.017
LOOKS LIKE HELL.

20:27.017 --> 20:29.895
ANY IDEA
WHERE TO LOOK FOR HIM?

20:29.895 --> 20:31.230
NO.

20:31.230 --> 20:34.399
SO IF I ACCEPTED THAT
AND SPLIT,

20:34.399 --> 20:36.693
THE NEXT PLACE YOU HEAD
WOULDN'T BE ACEVEDO'S HANGOUT?

20:36.693 --> 20:38.403
YOU'RE CALLING ME A LIAR?

20:38.403 --> 20:39.738
JUST ASKING A QUESTION.

20:39.738 --> 20:41.323
DID YOU FORGET
THAT I'M A BOSS

20:41.323 --> 20:43.408
OR THAT THE VICTIM
IS MY MOTHER?

20:43.408 --> 20:45.327
I KNOW SHE'S YOUR MOTHER,
BUT THIS IS MY CASE.

20:45.327 --> 20:47.829
I CAN'T LET YOU
LOOK FOR HIM ALONE.

20:47.829 --> 20:49.998
ANOTHER HOMICIDE
IN THE STREET, BOSS.

20:49.998 --> 20:51.291
HOUSTON AND COLUMBIA.

20:51.291 --> 20:52.751
YOU GUYS ROLL ON IT.

20:59.258 --> 21:02.928
KIKI HAD A BABY MAMA
IN HELL'S KITCHEN.

21:02.928 --> 21:04.221
YOU DRIVING OR ME?

21:04.221 --> 21:05.931
I'LL DRIVE.

21:24.908 --> 21:26.827
WE'LL START THE CANVASS.

21:26.827 --> 21:28.996
Man: JUST DOING
BUSINESS AS USUAL,
THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN...

21:28.996 --> 21:30.289
WHAT DO WE GOT?

21:30.289 --> 21:32.124
GUY WAS WALKING ALONG,
JUST DROPPED.

21:32.124 --> 21:33.625
ANYBODY SEE A SHOOTER?

21:33.625 --> 21:34.793
NO ONE EVEN HEARD A SHOT.

21:34.793 --> 21:37.337
ALL RIGHT, THANKS.

21:37.337 --> 21:40.215
"CHARLES SPIVEY."
NYU LIBRARY CARD.

21:40.215 --> 21:42.092
THE D.O.A.
FROM THIS MORNING -- LERNER.

21:42.092 --> 21:43.468
HE WAS FACULTY AT NYU.

21:43.468 --> 21:45.595
ANYTHING THERE
ABOUT THIS GUY BEING FACULTY?

21:45.595 --> 21:47.222
NO, LOOKS LIKE
A STUDENT CARD.

21:47.222 --> 21:49.224
STILL, BOTH NYU.
COULD BE RELATED.

21:49.224 --> 21:52.060
SOME PSYCHO ON A KILLING SPREE,
I'M TRYING TO GET TO MY KID.

21:52.060 --> 21:53.770
ANYTHING JUMP OUT?

21:53.770 --> 21:56.148
HOT DOG VENDOR SAID THE GUY
WENT DOWN LIKE HE TRIPPED.

21:56.148 --> 21:57.274
THEN HE SAW THE BLOOD.

21:57.274 --> 21:58.275
SO NOTHING.

21:58.275 --> 21:59.818
NOTHING.

21:59.818 --> 22:02.154
ENTRY AND EXIT WOUND
THE SAME AS LERNER,

22:02.154 --> 22:04.489
SO GET ESU
TO SEARCH FOR THE SLUG.

22:04.489 --> 22:05.824
WHAT, ARE WE THINKING
THESE TWO ARE CONNECTED?

22:05.824 --> 22:07.826
WITH MY LUCK,
YES, WE ARE.

22:20.589 --> 22:21.757
OVER THERE.

22:21.757 --> 22:23.008
HERE WE GO.

22:27.929 --> 22:29.890
WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING, HUH?

22:32.267 --> 22:34.936
WE'VE GOT SOME QUESTIONS, KIKI.
WE NEED YOU TO TAKE A RIDE.

22:34.936 --> 22:36.313
COME ON.

22:36.313 --> 22:38.190
I DIDN'T DO NOTHING!
SHUT YOUR MOUTH!

22:39.399 --> 22:40.484
WAIT, IS THAT
ANTONIO RODRIGUEZ?

22:40.484 --> 22:42.027
SHUT UP, KIKI!

22:42.027 --> 22:43.236
YO, MAN,
YOU GOT SERIOUS, BRO.

22:43.236 --> 22:44.946
YOU NEED SOME PRISON LIFE
TO GET THAT SMILE BACK.

22:44.946 --> 22:47.074
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE'RE NOT GOING TO BROOKLYN.

22:47.074 --> 22:48.992
15's CLOSER.

22:48.992 --> 22:50.660
WHAT, ARE YOU TRYING
TO GET ME TO JACKPOT?

22:50.660 --> 22:54.081
NO, I'M JUST TELLING YOU
WHERE WE'RE GOING.

22:54.081 --> 22:55.290
I GOT TO CALL MY LIEUTENANT.

22:55.290 --> 22:57.334
HE'S GOING TO WANT
TO ROLL ON THIS.

22:57.334 --> 22:58.877
THAT'S UP TO YOU.

23:06.760 --> 23:09.346
NO, SON, YOU'LL BE BACK
IN SCHOOL TOMORROW.

23:09.346 --> 23:12.557
I JUST WANTED YOU OUT
A LITTLE EARLY TODAY.

23:12.557 --> 23:14.017
GO HAVE FUN,

23:14.017 --> 23:16.269
AND, YEAH, WE'LL TALK
ABOUT IT LATER, OKAY?

23:16.269 --> 23:18.313
ALL RIGHT, WHY DON'T
YOU PUT JOHN ON NOW?

23:18.313 --> 23:22.067
YEAH. OKAY. BYE-BYE.

23:22.067 --> 23:24.736
CATCH ME UP
ON THE SHOOTINGS.

23:24.736 --> 23:26.405
RUN IT FOR HIM.
I'LL BE RIGHT IN.

23:28.073 --> 23:29.991
HEY, HEY, JOHN?
[ TELEPHONE RINGS ]

23:29.991 --> 23:32.536
HANG ON A SEC, WILL YOU?

23:32.536 --> 23:35.497
SIPOWICZ.

23:35.497 --> 23:37.541
NO COMMENT. CALL DCPI.

23:37.541 --> 23:38.875
JOHN --
[ TELEPHONE RINGS ]

23:38.875 --> 23:40.669
HOLD ON.

23:40.669 --> 23:43.672
CALL DCPI.

23:43.672 --> 23:46.800
NO. NO, NOT YOU, SARGE.

23:46.800 --> 23:49.261
YEAH. WHAT DO YOU GOT?

23:51.638 --> 23:55.058
WORKING ON A POSSIBLE CONNECTION
BETWEEN LERNER AND SPIVEY,

23:55.058 --> 23:57.602
AND EVERY THURSDAY AT 9:50,

23:57.602 --> 23:59.896
BOTH GOT OUT OF CLASS
WITHIN A FLOOR OF EACH OTHER

23:59.896 --> 24:02.190
IN THE NYU MAIN BUILDING.

24:02.190 --> 24:03.608
AND THESE TWO
PASSING IN THE HALL

24:03.608 --> 24:05.235
SOMEHOW INVOKED THE RAGE
OF A THIRD PARTY?

24:05.235 --> 24:06.945
FACTOR IN LERNER'S MISTRESS,

24:06.945 --> 24:09.906
AND THUS FAR, YOU'VE GOT
A DEFINITE NYU THEME.

24:09.906 --> 24:12.075
ANYTHING ON SPIVEY?

24:12.075 --> 24:14.411
NO SHEET. HIS ROOMMATE
SAID HE WAS FROM FRESNO.

24:14.411 --> 24:16.204
PHILOSOPHY MAJOR,
MADE GOOD GRADES.

24:16.204 --> 24:18.957
DID THE ROOMMATE MENTION
A MARK LERNER OR THE MISTRESS?

24:18.957 --> 24:20.292
NEITHER OF THEM.

24:20.292 --> 24:22.294
AND ESU COULDN'T
LOCATE EITHER SLUG.

24:22.294 --> 24:24.796
GUESS WE HEAD OUT
AND RECANVASS.

24:25.881 --> 24:27.215
KNOCK, KNOCK.

24:27.215 --> 24:28.425
EXCUSE ME.

24:28.425 --> 24:29.468
WE GOT SHOTS FIRED

24:29.468 --> 24:31.344
AT A GAS STATION
AT SECOND AND "B."

24:31.344 --> 24:32.762
BULLETS OUT OF NOWHERE,
BUT UNIFORM SAYS

24:32.762 --> 24:34.389
THAT THERE'S A SLUG
IN THE SHEETROCK WALL,

24:34.389 --> 24:35.682
COULD BE INTACT.

24:35.682 --> 24:38.351
GET DOWN THERE
AND FOLLOW IT TO BALLISTICS.

24:42.189 --> 24:43.857
WE'LL GET YOU
A LITTLE BELL TO RING

24:43.857 --> 24:45.192
SO NEXT TIME, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO SAY "KNOCK, KNOCK."

24:47.152 --> 24:50.197
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT I'M DOING DOWN HERE,

24:50.197 --> 24:52.282
AND I GOT
TO GET MY BALLS BROKE?

24:52.282 --> 24:55.410
PERP WAS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
I WAS JUST TRYING TO SAVE TIME.

24:55.410 --> 24:57.162
YOU TALKED TO HIM?

24:57.162 --> 24:58.413
I WAS WAITING
FOR THE BIG GUNS.

24:58.413 --> 24:59.998
LET'S DO IT.

25:07.881 --> 25:09.883
COME ON, BLOUNT.

25:13.136 --> 25:15.430
SO WHAT'S UP?

25:15.430 --> 25:16.848
WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?

25:16.848 --> 25:19.226
WHAT WE'RE DOING, HOMEBOY,

25:19.226 --> 25:21.019
IS TELLING YOU TO SHUT UP,

25:21.019 --> 25:23.730
'CAUSE I'M
WHO ASKS THE QUESTIONS.

25:25.815 --> 25:28.360
EXPRESS YOUR WHEREABOUTS
NOON TODAY.

25:29.694 --> 25:31.655
Kiki: EXPRESS MY WHEREABOUTS?

25:31.655 --> 25:35.158
I HEREBY TELL YOU
THAT I WAS OUT AND ABOUT.

25:35.158 --> 25:37.160
ANYBODY VOUCH FOR YOU?

25:37.160 --> 25:39.704
WHERE'S RODRIGUEZ?
I WAS EXPECTING A REUNION.

25:39.704 --> 25:41.873
THAT YOU BACK THERE, TONIO?
WHAT'S UP --

25:41.873 --> 25:44.459
HEY! EYES FRONT, STUPID.

25:44.459 --> 25:46.878
YO, MAN, YOU'RE GOING
TO BREAK THE TABLE.

25:46.878 --> 25:50.298
YO, WHY YOU DISRESPECTING ME
WITH THIS LOW-RENT CHUMP, BRO?

25:50.298 --> 25:51.591
KEEP TALKING TRASH,
YOU'RE GOING

25:51.591 --> 25:53.677
TO FIND YOUR ASS BACK IN JAIL.
YOU WANT THAT, KIKI?

25:53.677 --> 25:55.262
NO, MA'AM.

25:55.262 --> 25:57.764
EXPLAIN THE SCRATCHES.

25:57.764 --> 26:02.269
I'M NAILING THIS REALLY FEISTY
PIECE OF ASS.

26:02.269 --> 26:05.397
NAME AND NUMBER.

26:05.397 --> 26:07.274
WHAT AM I DOING HERE, MAN?

26:07.274 --> 26:08.817
ELDERLY WOMAN FOUGHT HER WAY
OUT OF A RAPE THIS MORNING.

26:08.817 --> 26:10.277
YOUR NAME CAME UP.

26:10.277 --> 26:13.196
LOOK, I'VE BEEN OUT OF THE CAN
JUST TWO MONTHS, BABY.

26:13.196 --> 26:14.447
MY NOSE IS CLEAN.

26:14.447 --> 26:16.241
EXPLAIN YOUR FINGERPRINT
IN HER APARTMENT.

26:16.241 --> 26:18.159
WHERE'S THE APARTMENT?

26:18.159 --> 26:19.286
CADMON TOWER, 6B.

26:19.286 --> 26:20.704
SEE, I WORK FOR A PLUMBER

26:20.704 --> 26:22.414
WHO'S GOT A CONTRACT
WITH CADMON TOWER.

26:22.414 --> 26:24.124
I'VE BEEN IN A LOT
OF THOSE APARTMENTS.

26:24.124 --> 26:25.625
I'VE TOUCHED
A LOT OF STUFF.

26:25.625 --> 26:27.127
OKAY.

26:27.127 --> 26:29.629
EXPLAIN WHAT YOUR PRINT'S
DOING IN THIS WOMAN'S BLOOD.

26:34.426 --> 26:35.594
WHAT'S THAT NOW?

26:35.594 --> 26:36.928
THE ONLY WAY YOUR PRINT
WINDS UP IN HER BLOOD

26:36.928 --> 26:38.888
IS IF YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO DID HER HARM.

26:38.888 --> 26:39.931
NOW EXPLAIN THAT.

26:39.931 --> 26:42.183
OR WE COULD STOP
WASTING TIME

26:42.183 --> 26:44.561
AND START TALKING ABOUT WAYS
OF GETTING YOU IN FRONT OF THIS.

26:44.561 --> 26:46.271
SWEATING NOW, EH, STUPID?

26:46.271 --> 26:47.480
Tony: SHUT UP, BLOUNT.

26:47.480 --> 26:48.773
LISTEN, AMIGO,

26:48.773 --> 26:51.234
YOU CAN'T BEAT A COP'S MOM
AND SKATE FREE.

26:51.234 --> 26:53.111
YOU WILL LEAVE EVIDENCE --

26:53.111 --> 26:55.739
FIBERS IN THE CARPET,
HAIRS IN A SWEATER,

26:55.739 --> 26:57.032
OR BLOOD PRINTS

26:57.032 --> 26:59.701
RIGHT SMACK IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE KITCHEN LINOLEUM.

27:02.787 --> 27:04.456
RIGHT IN THE KITCHEN, HUH?

27:05.957 --> 27:08.501
I'VE NEVER BEEN
IN THE KITCHEN --

27:08.501 --> 27:10.003
LEGIT OR OTHERWISE.

27:10.003 --> 27:13.131
HE BLEW IT.

27:13.131 --> 27:14.549
IT'S JUST AN EXAMPLE, KIKI.

27:14.549 --> 27:16.259
LET'S GET BACK
TO HELPING YOU OUT.

27:16.259 --> 27:19.137
YOU DON'T GOT MY PRINT
IN NOBODY'S BLOOD.

27:19.137 --> 27:22.057
BESIDES, YOU KNOW,
I GET PLENTY OF TRIM.

27:22.057 --> 27:23.391
I DON'T NEED TO GO

27:23.391 --> 27:27.437
BANGING NO COP'S
CHILI-PICKING MAMA.

27:27.437 --> 27:29.022
THAT ATTITUDE
MIGHT STRAIGHTEN OUT

27:29.022 --> 27:31.483
WITH SOME LOST TEETH.
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

27:37.947 --> 27:40.283
I WANT A LAWYER, HOMEBOY.

27:42.661 --> 27:43.828
SOUNDS GOOD.

27:43.828 --> 27:45.622
I'LL MEET YOU OVER THERE.

27:50.960 --> 27:51.961
LIEU.

27:51.961 --> 27:53.004
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

27:53.004 --> 27:54.673
GREAT NEWS.
GOOD, I COULD USE SOME.

27:54.673 --> 27:56.883
BALLISTICS
GOT US ON THE AIR.

27:56.883 --> 27:59.678
THEY ALREADY RESPONDED
TO THE CRIME SCENE.

27:59.678 --> 28:00.929
THEY I.D.'d THE BULLET

28:00.929 --> 28:03.723
AS COMING
FROM A RARE HUNTING RIFLE.

28:03.723 --> 28:05.350
THERE'S THREE
REGISTERED IN THE STATE,

28:05.350 --> 28:06.726
ONE IN THE CITY.

28:06.726 --> 28:08.353
WELL, WE LOCATE THE OWNER
IN THE CITY?

28:08.353 --> 28:09.688
GERALD VENNIT.

28:09.688 --> 28:11.356
HE LIVES WITH HIS PARENTS,
WHO HAVEN'T SEEN HIM,

28:11.356 --> 28:14.859
BUT HIS EMPLOYER SAYS
THAT VENNIT DOES SCUT WORK

28:14.859 --> 28:16.820
AT VARIOUS
CONSTRUCTION SITES.

28:16.820 --> 28:19.864
ONE IS NEAR A BUILDING
AT THIRD AND "C,"

28:19.864 --> 28:21.324
WHICH, IF YOU WERE
MOVING AROUND,

28:21.324 --> 28:23.743
DIFFERENT SIDES
ON HIGHER FLOORS

28:23.743 --> 28:25.161
OR THE ROOFTOP,

28:25.161 --> 28:28.206
AND YOU HAD A HIGH-POWERED
HUNTING RIFLE WITH A SCOPE,

28:28.206 --> 28:30.792
YOU COULD NAIL
ALL THREE SHOOTING SPOTS.

28:30.792 --> 28:33.753
I-I FIGURED THAT OUT
LOOKING AT THE MAP.

28:33.753 --> 28:36.548
YEAH, ANDY SUGGESTED
THAT I DO SO.

28:36.548 --> 28:37.882
GOOD WORK, BOTH OF YOU.

28:37.882 --> 28:42.554
BUT, UM, UNTIL WE ACTUALLY
TALK WITH THE PERP,

28:42.554 --> 28:44.472
WE DON'T KNOW
IF THESE ARE RANDOM SHOOTINGS,

28:44.472 --> 28:46.349
WHICH THEY APPEAR TO BE.

28:46.349 --> 28:47.934
HOW IS ACTUALLY
GETTING A PERP FACILITATED

28:47.934 --> 28:50.270
BY YOU STANDING HERE
TALKING TO ME?

28:50.270 --> 28:51.563
GO.

28:56.151 --> 28:57.944
YOU KICKED ACEVEDO.

28:57.944 --> 28:59.696
YEAH, BLOUNT'S WALKING HIM OUT
WITH SOME STERN WORDS.

28:59.696 --> 29:01.281
GOOD, 'CAUSE THOSE WERE
GREAT IN THE ROOM.

29:01.281 --> 29:02.282
WE'LL RECANVASS,

29:02.282 --> 29:03.658
YOUR MOM SAID
THAT HE SPOKE TO HER,

29:03.658 --> 29:04.993
WE CAN RUN A VOICE LINEUP.

29:04.993 --> 29:06.828
THAT'LL WORK.

29:06.828 --> 29:09.414
YOU GOING TO HUNT
THIS GUY DOWN?

29:09.414 --> 29:10.790
IT'S NOT YOUR BUSINESS,

29:10.790 --> 29:12.751
BUT I'M GOING TO THE HOSPITAL
TO SEE MY MOM.

29:12.751 --> 29:14.544
SHE WAS RELEASED
AN HOUR AGO.

29:14.544 --> 29:18.465
THEN I'M GOING
TO HER APARTMENT. ARE WE DONE?

29:35.815 --> 29:36.941
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

29:36.941 --> 29:38.693
I WAS GOING
TO ASK YOU THE SAME THING.

29:38.693 --> 29:40.987
GET OUT OF THIS CAR

29:40.987 --> 29:42.489
IF YOU'RE GOING
TO TALK TO MY SUSPECT,

29:42.489 --> 29:45.366

I OUGHT TO BE THERE?

29:45.366 --> 29:48.536

YOU CROSSED THE LINE.
I'M A COP.

30:55.478 --> 30:57.438
BUSTING SCUMBAGS IS MY JOB.

30:57.438 --> 30:59.899
A COP PRETENDING
TO BE A SCUMBAG KIND OF
BLURS THAT LINE, EH, TONY?

30:59.899 --> 31:02.193

TO COME AFTER MY FAMILY!

31:02.193 --> 31:05.071
HEY, YOU WERE LIKE A BROTHER.
YOU CAME AFTER ME, REMEMBER?

31:05.071 --> 31:06.364
I WAS WORKING AN ASSIGNMENT.

31:06.364 --> 31:07.740

MY GIRL'S 12 NOW.

31:11.744 --> 31:13.663
SHE DON'T EVEN RECOGNIZE
HER FATHER.

31:13.663 --> 31:16.291
YOU<i> CHOSE </i>TO BE A CRIMINAL.
YOU KNEW THE RISKS.

31:16.291 --> 31:17.292
YEAH?

31:17.292 --> 31:18.793
WELL, NOW YOU KNOW YOURS.

31:18.793 --> 31:20.211

TO WRITE A STATEMENT NOW

31:20.211 --> 31:21.337
OR BACK AT THE HOUSE?

31:21.337 --> 31:22.881
WHY DON'T YOU GO GET

31:34.893 --> 31:36.185
NO LAWYERS, KIKI.

31:36.185 --> 31:37.478

31:37.478 --> 31:39.022
THAT'S HOW WE'RE GOING
TO PLAY IT.

31:39.022 --> 31:40.857
YOU CAN'T DO THIS. YO, LADY,
WHY DON'T YOU COME ON?

31:40.857 --> 31:41.858

31:46.613 --> 31:48.948
LOOK, YOU SOLD ME OUT, OKAY?

31:52.744 --> 31:55.705
DID YOU BREAK IN ON MY MOTHER,
OR ARE YOU A DEAD MAN?!

32:02.003 --> 32:03.421
I DID THE BREAK-IN.

32:03.421 --> 32:05.006
YOU'RE GOING
TO STAND UP TO THAT

32:05.006 --> 32:07.884
IN YOUR STATEMENT TO THE D.A.
AND ANYBODY WHO ASKS.

32:07.884 --> 32:09.844
YOU COME OFF OF IT,
AND I'LL KILL YOU.

32:09.844 --> 32:11.596

33:02.063 --> 33:03.898

TO HANG ONTO IT.

33:03.898 --> 33:05.692
I DIDN'T HURT THOSE PEOPLE.

33:17.787 --> 33:19.706
WON'T NOBODY KNOW
WHO'S THE MAN.

33:19.706 --> 33:21.916
YOU'RE WORRIED NOBODY
WILL KNOW YOU'RE THE MAN?

33:21.916 --> 33:23.960

33:53.573 --> 33:55.992

MAJOR WACKO.

WE'LL WALK OUT REAL SLOW

COMING AFTER YOUR FAMILY.

DID MARK'S DEATH
HAVE ANYTHING TO DO

WITH HIM MAYBE
HAVING AN AFFAIR?

37:03.346 --> 37:05.640
WHY DO YOU ASK?

37:05.640 --> 37:09.227
I WAS GOING THROUGH
A DRAWER IN HIS DESK,

AND I FOUND A NOTE,

37:12.104 --> 37:14.523

DID YOU FIND ANY EVIDENCE
THAT MARK HAD A MISTRESS?

37:17.318 --> 37:19.195
NO.

WAS A RANDOM OCCURRENCE,

HOWEVER, THE DEATH OF THOSE
HEROIC OFFICERS AND FIREFIGHTERS

DID SERVE TO UNDERSCORE
A MAINSTAY OF THE JOB,

TO SACRIFICE

41:13.137 --> 41:14.472
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

41:14.472 --> 41:16.056
WHEN YOUR FATHER
HAS 26 YEARS ON THE JOB,

41:16.056 --> 41:17.683
YOU CONSULT HIM

41:17.683 --> 41:19.602
BEFORE PLANTING YOURSELF
IN A HELLHOLE.

41:19.602 --> 41:21.228
YOU AFRAID HE'S GOING
TO WORK ACTUAL CRIME

41:21.228 --> 41:23.355
INSTEAD OF GETTING CATS
OUT OF TREES WITH YOU?

41:23.355 --> 41:24.815
GO DRINK YOUR GRADE PAY.

41:24.815 --> 41:26.150
DON'T FORGET
THE WAY YOU GOT IT --

41:26.150 --> 41:27.276
COST MY SON
A HOLE IN HIS ARM.

41:27.276 --> 41:28.861
NO, DAD,
HE SAVED MY ASS.

41:28.861 --> 41:29.862
Sipowicz: FORGET IT.

41:29.862 --> 41:31.071
I'LL SEE YOU AROUND.

41:42.124 --> 41:44.752
NEXT TIME,
WE'LL GO EARLY IN THE MORNING.

41:44.752 --> 41:46.212
IT'S BETTER
EARLY IN THE MORNING.

41:46.212 --> 41:49.256
ARE THE FISH
MORE HUNGRY THEN?

41:49.256 --> 41:53.093
THEY'RE HUNGRIER, YEAH.
THAT'S HOW YOU SAY THAT.

41:53.093 --> 41:54.678
HUNGRIER.

41:56.805 --> 41:58.891
THEO, UH, WHY DON'T WE
SIT HERE FOR A MINUTE

41:58.891 --> 42:00.893
AND WATCH THE BOATS
GO BY, OKAY?

42:06.857 --> 42:08.025
SO, UH...

42:10.903 --> 42:13.447
YOU HAD A FUN DAY
RUNNING AROUND WITH JOHN?

42:13.447 --> 42:16.367
I DIDN'T
HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL.

42:16.367 --> 42:18.827
YEAH, WELL, THAT'S NOT
GOING TO HAPPEN A LOT.

42:18.827 --> 42:20.412
YOU SEE, THEO,

42:20.412 --> 42:22.998
DADDY WAS ON THE NEWS TODAY

42:22.998 --> 42:25.209
BECAUSE A BAD MAN
HAD TO BE STOPPED

42:25.209 --> 42:26.961
FROM HURTING PEOPLE.

42:26.961 --> 42:29.755
WHAT HAPPENED?

42:29.755 --> 42:32.925
DADDY HAD TO SHOOT THE MAN.

42:32.925 --> 42:35.135
DID HE DIE?

42:35.135 --> 42:38.138
THAT'S NOT WHAT I WANTED
TO HAPPEN,

42:38.138 --> 42:40.474
BUT, YES, HE DID DIE.

42:43.060 --> 42:46.272
I KNOW THAT'S SCARY
TO THINK ABOUT,

42:46.272 --> 42:48.816
BUT I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND
THAT I DID IT

42:48.816 --> 42:51.360
TO SAVE
GOOD PEOPLE'S LIVES.

42:51.360 --> 42:55.072
WILL SOMEONE SHOOT YOU?

42:57.157 --> 42:58.617
NO.

42:58.617 --> 43:00.619
NO, SON.

43:00.619 --> 43:03.497
NOBODY'S GOING
TO SHOOT DADDY.

43:03.497 --> 43:05.624
DADDY WILL ALWAYS
BE HERE WITH YOU.

43:08.335 --> 43:10.671
[ SHIP HORN BLOWS ]

43:10.671 --> 43:12.214
LOOK AT THAT BOAT.

43:12.214 --> 43:14.216
IT'S PRETTY NEAT, HUH?

43:14.216 --> 43:16.093
NEAT.

43:18.512 --> 43:19.888
YOU OKAY?

43:22.099 --> 43:24.059
READY TO HEAD HOME?

43:24.059 --> 43:27.021
FIRST, CAN I GO LOOK
AT THAT MAN'S FISH?

43:29.148 --> 43:30.357
ALL RIGHT.

43:30.357 --> 43:32.318
GO LOOK AT THE FISH.

43:32.318 --> 43:33.485
WHEN I GROW UP,

43:33.485 --> 43:35.696
I'M GOING TO BE
LIKE YOU, DADDY.

43:35.696 --> 43:37.615
I WANT TO KILL
BAD PEOPLE.

43:41.952 --> 43:44.038
OOH, NICE FISH.
