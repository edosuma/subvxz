00:06.840 --> 00:09.110
APPARENTLY,
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY GUY

00:09.143 --> 00:11.479
WHO THINKS BIG MEDIA
AND BIG BUSINESS

00:11.512 --> 00:14.115
ARE CRUSHING THE HUMANITY
OUT OF HUMANITY.

00:14.148 --> 00:15.649
I'M GONNA CRUSH THE HUMANITY
OUT OF YOU

00:15.683 --> 00:17.318
IF YOUNO, SERIOUSLY.LKING.

00:17.351 --> 00:18.986
SOUNDS LIKE YOU

00:46.347 --> 00:47.481

IT COULD USE A LITTLE LIME.

YOU MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER

01:03.397 --> 01:05.533
A SLIGHTLY LESS
MELODRAMATIC APPROACH.

01:05.566 --> 01:07.368
IT'S NOT ABOUT
THE MONEY, DOC.

01:07.401 --> 01:09.337
IT'S ABOUT
THE WORKING CONDITIONS.

01:09.370 --> 01:12.540

A LITTLE COMMON COURTESY.

01:50.578 --> 01:51.945
COME NOW, OLD BOY.

01:53.147 --> 01:56.250

THE AWKWARD SYNTAX.

"SLAVISHLY FAWNING

02:01.589 --> 02:03.757
CLEARLY THE WORDS
HAVE BEEN TWISTED

02:03.791 --> 02:05.926
AROUND SOME SORT OF
HIDDEN MESSAGE.

02:05.959 --> 02:08.196
THERE'S MY BOY.

IT'S HOW THE FRENCH

DURING WORLD WAR II --

02:30.484 --> 02:31.685

COULD SEE.

02:38.158 --> 02:39.593

HAVE WORK TO DO.

ON THE FRONT PAGE?

POSSIBLY THERE AREN'T ANY?

IN SOME RANDOM PIECE OF TEXT
MAKING THIS MUCH SENSE?

03:04.852 --> 03:06.620
OR IT COULD BE SOMETHING
COMPLETELY INNOCENT.

03:06.654 --> 03:08.789
THEN WHY HIDE IT
IN A CODE?

03:08.822 --> 03:11.091
LOOK AT THE GUY'S NAME --
JAMES SMITH.

03:11.124 --> 03:13.193
IT'S GOT TO BE THE MOST COMMON
NAME IN AMERICA.

03:13.227 --> 03:14.862
IT'S OBVIOUSLY AN ALIAS.

03:14.895 --> 03:16.964
AND WHY USE AN ALIAS UNLESS
YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING ILLICIT?

03:16.997 --> 03:19.933
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, THE LETTER
PROBABLY CAME IN VIA E-MAIL.

03:19.967 --> 03:22.002
THERE MIGHT BE SOME WAY
TO TRACE THE I.P.,

03:22.035 --> 03:24.505
BUT IT COULD BE FROM
AN INTERNET CAFé IN SINGAPORE.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.474

TAKING THIS SERIOUSLY?

03:26.507 --> 03:28.509

OKAY,
WE'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

03:40.153 --> 03:42.356
THAT WAS THE CPD.

03:42.390 --> 03:43.757
THEY NEED OUR HELP WITH
A POSSIBLE TERRORIST ATTACK.

03:43.791 --> 03:46.460
A LAWYER DOWNTOWN
OPENED UP A PACKAGE

AND GOT SPRAYED IN THE FACE
WITH SARIN.

03:48.161 --> 03:50.130

GOT THERE.

03:50.163 --> 03:51.532
OF COURSE, A LAWYER,

03:51.565 --> 03:54.835
BECAUSE THE BUTCHER TOLD HIM
WHERE TO START.

03:54.868 --> 03:56.670
WHAT THE [BLEEP]
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

03:56.704 --> 03:58.171
IT'S SHAKESPEARE --
"HENRY VI, PART 2."

03:58.205 --> 03:59.873
DICK THE BUTCHER SAYS,
"FIRST THING WE DO,

03:59.907 --> 04:01.375
LET'S KILL
ALL THE LAWYERS."

04:01.409 --> 04:02.776
A SARIN ATTACK.

04:02.810 --> 04:06.179
THAT SOUNDS LIKE
FRONT-PAGE NEWS TO ME.

04:15.323 --> 04:17.791
Maya: [ Voice breaking ]
NORMALLY, I OPEN

04:17.825 --> 04:19.993
MR. SCANTLIN'S MAIL

04:20.027 --> 04:22.796
BUT THERE WAS A BOX
MARKED "PERSONAL."

04:22.830 --> 04:24.798
HE THOUGHT SOMEONE
SENT HIM A PRESENT,

04:24.832 --> 04:27.000
SO HE OPENED IT HIMSELF.

04:27.034 --> 04:30.404
AND THERE WAS A POP,
LIKE A FIRECRACKER,

04:30.438 --> 04:33.273
AND SOME KIND OF SPRAY
CAME OUT.

04:33.307 --> 04:35.075
AND HE STARTED TWITCHING.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.677
I TRIED TO HELP HIM.

04:36.710 --> 04:39.112
THERE'S NOTHING YOU COULD
HAVE DONE, MISS BENOWITZ.

04:39.146 --> 04:40.814

THAN CYANIDE.

04:40.848 --> 04:43.250
Kate:
CAN YOU THINK OF ANYBODY

04:43.283 --> 04:45.619
WHO MIGHT HAVE HAD A REASON
TO DO THIS?

04:45.653 --> 04:48.956
TOM WAS A MENSCH.
EVERYBODY LOVED HIM.

04:48.989 --> 04:52.593
BUT HE WAS A TRIAL LAWYER.
HE WON A LOT OF CASES.

04:52.626 --> 04:55.929
I MEAN, THE --
THE LOSERS WEREN'T HAPPY.

04:55.963 --> 04:58.599
THERE IS NOTHING
ON THE PACKAGE --

04:58.632 --> 05:00.200
NO PRINTS,
NO RETURN ADDRESS.

05:00.233 --> 05:02.770
ALL RIGHT, WELL, WE'LL TALK
TO HIS FRIENDS, RELATIVES,

05:02.803 --> 05:04.271

05:04.304 --> 05:06.273
BUT I THINK WE SHOULD START
WITH HIS CASE FILES.

FARRINGTON
v. AWAKAMA SUSHI.

05:08.642 --> 05:10.110

MILLER v. KLAUSNER

05:15.082 --> 05:17.485
KLAUSNER WAS ORDERED TO PAY
$70,000 IN MEDICAL EXPENSES,

05:17.518 --> 05:19.653
$1.4 MILLION PUNITIVE.

05:19.687 --> 05:20.854
THIS COULD BE OUR GUY.

05:20.888 --> 05:23.056
WHY HIM
OUT OF ALL THESE CASES?

05:23.090 --> 05:24.625
SARIN'S A NERVE AGENT,

05:24.658 --> 05:26.494
BUT IT WAS ORIGINALLY DEVELOPED
AS A PESTICIDE.

05:26.527 --> 05:28.496
AN EXTERMINATOR WOULD HAVE
EVERYTHING HE NEEDED

05:28.529 --> 05:30.330
TO MIX UP A BATCH,
RIGHT ON THE SHELF.

05:31.499 --> 05:34.134

I HATE TOM SCANTLIN.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.470

FROM NOTHING.

05:39.507 --> 05:41.675
CONTRACTS WITH EVERY SCHOOL
DISTRICT IN THE COUNTY.

05:41.709 --> 05:44.812
NOT BAD FOR A GUY WHO NEVER
GOT PAST EIGHTH GRADE, HUH?

05:44.845 --> 05:46.814
AND THAT S.O.B.
TOOK IT ALL AWAY.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.482
ACTUALLY,
IT WAS A JURY OF YOUR PEERS

05:48.516 --> 05:50.484
WHO DECIDED AGAINST YOU.

05:50.518 --> 05:52.085
THEY DECIDED WRONG.

05:52.119 --> 05:54.488
LBJ ELEMENTARY HAD ROACHES
THE SIZE OF CHIPMUNKS.

05:54.522 --> 05:56.089
SO MY GUYS SPRAYED
WITH A VERY RELIABLE PESTICIDE

05:56.123 --> 05:58.492
I IMPORTED FROM MEXICO.

05:58.526 --> 05:59.960
WHICH YOU HAD TO DO

05:59.993 --> 06:01.995
BECAUSE IT WASN'T YET APPROVED
HERE IN THE U.S.

06:02.029 --> 06:04.297
THEY USE THAT STUFF LIKE KETCHUP
ON FRIES SOUTH OF THE BORDER,

06:04.331 --> 06:05.699
AND NO ONE'S COMPLAINING.

06:05.733 --> 06:08.101
SOMEONE NORTH OF THE BORDER
SURE COMPLAINED.

06:08.135 --> 06:09.537
ONE KID CRIES SICK,

06:09.570 --> 06:10.838
AND HIS PARENTS
GET A FAST-TALKING LAWYER

06:10.871 --> 06:12.205
WHO SUES THE CRAP
OUT OF ME.

06:13.441 --> 06:15.208
ON THE NEWS,
HE MADE IT SOUND

06:15.242 --> 06:17.144
LIKE I DELIBERATELY SET OUT
TO POISON SCHOOLCHILDREN.

06:20.814 --> 06:24.351
YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY THAT
YOU SHOULD MENTION THE NEWS,

06:24.384 --> 06:26.186
BECAUSE THERE WAS
A LETTER TO THE EDITOR

06:26.219 --> 06:27.821
IN TODAY'S PAPER

06:27.855 --> 06:30.624
ABOUT HOW THE MEDIA IS STACKED
AGAINST THE LITTLE GUY.

06:30.658 --> 06:32.292
YOU MIGHT
FIND IT INTERESTING.

06:32.325 --> 06:35.195
GO AHEAD. READ IT.

06:35.228 --> 06:37.698
SORRY, I DON'T HAVE
MY READING GLASSES.

06:37.731 --> 06:39.700
MAYBE YOU DON'T NEED
TO READ IT

06:39.733 --> 06:40.734
BECAUSE YOU ALREADY KNOW WHAT
IT SAYS BECAUSE YOU WROTE IT.

06:40.768 --> 06:42.002
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

06:42.035 --> 06:43.637
I DON'T WRITE LETTERS
TO THE PAPERS.

06:43.671 --> 06:44.905
LISTEN, JUST BECAUSE
I HATED SCANTLIN

06:44.938 --> 06:46.306
DOESN'T MEAN
THAT I KILLED HIM.

06:46.339 --> 06:48.075
SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

06:48.108 --> 06:51.479
I JUST -- I WANTED TO OFFER
MR. KLAUSNER MY READING GLASSES.

06:54.247 --> 06:58.085
YEAH, UH, I PROBABLY GOT
A DIFFERENT PRESCRIPTION.

06:58.118 --> 07:00.087
ALL RIGHT. I THINK
I UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON.

07:00.120 --> 07:03.056
DO -- DO YOU HAVE DYSLEXIA,
MR. KLAUSNER?

07:03.090 --> 07:04.458
HOW DID YOU --

07:04.492 --> 07:06.894
IT WOULD HELP EXPLAIN
WHY A MAN AS SMART AS YOU

07:06.927 --> 07:08.261
DIDN'T MAKE IT
PAST EIGHTH GRADE,

07:08.295 --> 07:09.396
AND WHY YOU DON'T
WANT TO READ THE LETTER.

07:09.429 --> 07:11.465
IT'S NOTHING
TO BE ASHAMED OF.

07:11.499 --> 07:12.700
IT JUST MEANS
YOU'RE NOT OUR MAN.

07:12.733 --> 07:13.967
Probert:
JUST BECAUSE HE'S DYSLEXIC

07:14.001 --> 07:15.603
DOESN'T MEAN HE'S INNOCENT.

07:15.636 --> 07:18.672
PROBERT, FOR HIM, WORDS AND
LETTERS SWIM AROUND THE PAGE.

07:18.706 --> 07:21.441
SO, SADLY, HE AVOIDS READING
AND WRITING ALTOGETHER.

07:21.475 --> 07:23.711
IT'S NOT LIKE HE SUDDENLY
WOKE UP ONE MORNING

07:23.744 --> 07:25.479
AND DECIDED TO START
COMMUNICATING

07:25.513 --> 07:27.180
BY CONSTRUCTING
ELABORATE CODES

07:27.214 --> 07:29.049
BURIED INSIDE
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR.

07:29.082 --> 07:32.052
SO IT'S BACK TO THE
NEEDLE-IN-A-HAYSTACK STRATEGY.

07:32.085 --> 07:34.387
ACTUALLY,
I'VE BEEN THINKING.

07:34.421 --> 07:38.091
THERE MAY BE A WAY TO GET
THE NEEDLE TO COME TO US.

07:38.125 --> 07:42.295
IN HIS CODE, THE KILLER SAYS,
"YOU'LL BE PROUD OF ME."

07:42.329 --> 07:44.865
HE'S LOOKING
FOR APPROVAL.

07:44.898 --> 07:46.299
IF I WRITE HIM BACK,

07:46.333 --> 07:47.768
TELL HIM WHAT A GREAT JOB
I THINK HE'S DOING,

07:47.801 --> 07:49.269
MAYBE HE'LL TALK TO ME.

07:49.302 --> 07:51.605
YOU PLAN ON MAKING FRIENDS
WITH THIS LUNATIC?

07:51.639 --> 07:54.775
WE'RE PEAS IN A POD.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.744
Kate:
"YOU THINK YOU HAVE GUTS,

07:56.777 --> 07:58.812
BUT ALL I HEAR IS WHINING
AND SELF-PITY."

07:58.846 --> 08:00.080
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO,

08:00.113 --> 08:01.582
GET HIM TO SARIN-GAS
THE WHOLE CITY?

08:01.615 --> 08:03.216
I THOUGHT THIS WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE A FAN LETTER.

08:03.250 --> 08:04.952
HAVE YOU CONSIDERED REQUESTING
A NEW PARTNER?

08:04.985 --> 08:07.621
YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO GET
HIS ATTEXACTLY.RIGHT?

08:07.655 --> 08:09.122
IF HE'S AS SMART
AS I THINK HE IS,

08:09.156 --> 08:10.390
HE'LL SEE
THE HIDDEN MESSAGE.

08:10.423 --> 08:11.759
EVERY 10 WORDS,
YOU SAID?

08:14.928 --> 08:16.463

08:16.496 --> 08:20.634
"I WISH I HAD YOUR GUTS.

08:33.346 --> 08:35.048
"KINDRED SPIRIT."
I LIKE THAT.

08:35.082 --> 08:36.917
WE SHOULD RUSH A COPY OF THIS
TO THE PAPER

08:36.950 --> 08:38.185
SO THEY CAN GET IT
IN TOMORROW'S EDITION.

08:38.218 --> 08:40.153
MAYBE WE COULD
BRING IT OVER THERE

08:40.187 --> 08:41.521
IN A HORSE AND BUGGY.

08:41.555 --> 08:42.990
IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO BE FUNNY?

08:43.023 --> 08:44.658
LISTEN, PAPERS
HAVE ONLINE EDITIONS.

08:44.692 --> 08:46.493
I'M JUST GONNA POST THIS
AS A COMMENT

08:46.526 --> 08:47.995
TO THE ORIGINAL LETTER,
OKAY?

08:54.034 --> 08:55.803
MAYBE HE'S NOT CHECKING
THE COMMENTS.

08:55.836 --> 08:57.504
MAYBE HE DOESN'T EVEN
OWN A COMPUTER.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.206
YOU KNOW,
MAYBE HE'S LIKE ME.

08:59.239 --> 09:01.675
SOME PEOPLE STILL LIKE THE FEEL
OF A NEWSPAPER IN THEIR HANDS.

09:01.709 --> 09:03.210
WHAT ARE YOU, A LUDDITE?

09:03.243 --> 09:05.345
THE LUDDITES
WERE ONTO SOMETHING.

09:06.814 --> 09:09.349
STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT PEOPLE
WHO SPEND TOO MUCH TIME ONLINE

09:09.382 --> 09:11.284
LOSE THE ABILITY TO IDENTIFY
SIMPLE EMOTIONS

09:11.318 --> 09:13.053
EXPRESSED IN PHOTOGRAPHS
OF HUMAN FACES.

09:13.086 --> 09:15.589
I MEAN, COMPUTERS MAY BE THE
GREATEST TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCE

09:15.623 --> 09:18.058
OF THE LAST 100 YEARS, BUT THIS
WHOLE INTERNET THING IS --

09:18.091 --> 09:20.728
INVALUABLE IN MAKING
INSTANTANEOUS CONTACT

09:20.761 --> 09:22.229
AT CRUCIAL TIMES?

09:22.262 --> 09:24.231
HE ANSWERED?
WHAT DID HE SAY?

09:24.264 --> 09:25.532
"HEY, KINDRED SPIRIT.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.868
"GLAD TO KNOW
I'M NOT ALONE.

09:27.901 --> 09:29.202
"YOU'LL GET
YOUR ANSWER TOMORROW

09:29.236 --> 09:30.604
"WHEN THE NEXT [BLEEP]
GETS HIS MAIL.

09:30.638 --> 09:32.472
"BUT IF YOU'RE AS SMART
AS I THINK YOU ARE,

09:32.505 --> 09:34.041
YOU CAN BE THERE
WHEN IT HAPPENS."

09:34.074 --> 09:35.075
WHAT THE [BLEEP] IS THAT?

09:37.110 --> 09:38.979
IT'S ANOTHER CIPHER.

09:39.012 --> 09:40.714
HE WANTS TO MAKE SURE I'M THE
ONLY ONE THAT GETS THE MESSAGE.

09:40.748 --> 09:42.616
CAN YOU DECIPHER IT?

09:42.650 --> 09:45.152
Codebreaker:
THAT'S A NASTY ONE.

09:49.056 --> 09:52.025
AND IT'S ONLY, WHAT?

09:52.059 --> 09:54.762
SIX HOURS BEFORE
THE MORNING POST COMES 'ROUND.

09:56.797 --> 09:59.767
NOT SURE IF WE CAN CRACK IT
IN TIME.

10:10.443 --> 10:12.880
NO. NO. NO.

10:12.913 --> 10:15.716
IT'S NOT A VIGENèRE SEQUENCE.

10:15.749 --> 10:17.885
AND IT'S NOT A POLYALPHABETIC
SUBSTITUTION, EITHER.

10:17.918 --> 10:19.552
WHAT THE [BLEEP] IS THAT?

10:19.586 --> 10:21.755
WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE
IF IT'S NOT WHAT IT IS?

10:21.789 --> 10:24.658
TRACED THE I.P. ADDRESS THE GUY
USED TO SEND THE REPLY FROM.

10:24.692 --> 10:26.226
CAME UP EMPTY.

10:26.259 --> 10:27.795
CODEBREAKERS AT THE NSA
COME UP WITH ANYTHING?

10:27.828 --> 10:29.462
NOTHING YET.

10:29.496 --> 10:31.398
WELL, THEN
HE BETTER HURRY UP,

10:31.431 --> 10:33.266
BECAUSE THE CHICAGO
POSTAL WORKERS

10:33.300 --> 10:35.402
ARE ABOUT TO HAVE
THEIR MORNING COFFEE!

10:35.435 --> 10:37.938
YEAH, DO YOU NOT THINK I'M
EXCRUCIATINGLY AWARE OF THAT?

10:37.971 --> 10:39.572
I CAN'T --
DON'T -- I CAN'T --

10:39.606 --> 10:42.109
I CAN'T DO THIS WITH EVERYBODY
HOVERING AROUND ME.

10:45.012 --> 10:47.480
[ SIGHS ]
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

10:47.514 --> 10:51.418
THOUGHT YOU COULD USE
A LITTLE BIT OF HELP.

10:51.451 --> 10:53.586
YEAH,
YOU'VE BEEN A BIG HELP.

10:53.620 --> 10:55.923
WHAT FUN IS THERE
PLAYING A GAME

10:55.956 --> 10:59.459
IF THE OTHER FELLOW
HASN'T GOT A SPORTING CHANCE?

10:59.492 --> 11:02.662
YOU'RE TALKING IN RIDDLES.
I HAVE ENOUGH OF THOSE.

11:02.696 --> 11:06.099
I'M SIMPLY SAYING IT WOULDN'T
BE CRICKET FOR THIS FELLOW

11:06.133 --> 11:07.667
TO WRITE A CODE

11:07.701 --> 11:10.637
WITHOUT SENDING ALONG AT LEAST
A HINT OF HOW TO CRACK IT.

11:10.670 --> 11:14.641
YOU THINK THE KILLER HID A KEY
WITHIN THE CODE ITSELF.

11:14.674 --> 11:20.147
WELL, IF HE HAD,
HE'D LIKELY OPEN WITH IT...

11:20.180 --> 11:22.215
WOULDN'T HE?

11:24.818 --> 11:28.789
LOOK AT THE NUMBERS,
PIERCE.

11:28.822 --> 11:33.660
LOOK VERY CLOSELY
AT THE NUMBERS.

11:36.897 --> 11:40.868
WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN THE GROUPS OF FIGURES?

11:40.901 --> 11:42.970
[ SIGHS ]

11:43.003 --> 11:46.807
14, 41...

11:46.840 --> 11:50.210
NO. 144. 12.

11:50.243 --> 11:52.379
144 IS THE SQUARE OF 12.

11:52.412 --> 11:54.381
225 IS THE SQUARE
OF 15.

11:54.414 --> 11:56.049
SQUARES AND THEIR ROOTS.

11:56.083 --> 12:00.153
WELL, THAT'S GOT
TO MEAN SOMETHING.

12:00.187 --> 12:02.489
WHAT? WHAT?
S-SQUARE ROOTS.

12:02.522 --> 12:03.723
SQUARES.

12:03.757 --> 12:06.226
N-NOT "ROOT"
LIKE A POTATO.

12:06.259 --> 12:08.528
A ROUTE --
LIKE A HIGHWAY!

12:08.561 --> 12:10.998
IT'S A ROUTE CIPHER.

12:11.031 --> 12:13.166

THE NUMBERS WERE THE TELL.

12:13.200 --> 12:14.501
SQUARES AND THEIR ROOTS.

12:14.534 --> 12:16.069
BUT THE THREE STOOD APART,

12:16.103 --> 12:18.071
MEANING YOU BREAK
EACH STRING OF LETTERS

12:18.105 --> 12:19.773
INTO THREE EQUAL ROWS.

12:19.807 --> 12:21.842
THEN YOU JUST -- YOU JUST HAVE
TO FIGURE OUT THE ROUTE.

12:21.875 --> 12:23.343
IT COULD BE

12:23.376 --> 12:24.477
OR IN A SPIRAL PATTERN --

12:24.511 --> 12:25.712

THIS IS FANTASTIC,

12:25.745 --> 12:27.514
BUT CAN YOU JUST TELL ME
WHAT IT SAYS?

HERE.

HAVE THEM CLEAR THE BUILDING

12:38.458 --> 12:41.061
AND WARN THEIR EMPLOYEES
NOT TO OPEN UP ANY MAIL.

12:41.094 --> 12:42.562
I'M GONNA GET
AN AMBULANCE OVER THERE.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.431
TELL THEM TO BRING ATROPINE
AND PRALIDOXIME CHLORIDE

12:47.400 --> 12:48.802
PRESIDENT OF
FIRST MONUMENT BANK

12:48.836 --> 12:50.237
OPENED A PACKAGE
10 MINUTES AGO.

12:50.270 --> 12:51.371
HE GOT BLASTED WITH SARIN.

12:51.404 --> 12:53.740
HIS NAME'S RUSS ANDERSON.

12:53.773 --> 12:55.408
HE'S ON HIS WAY
TO THE E.R.

13:01.281 --> 13:02.782
IF I'D BEEN
10 MINUTES FASTER,

13:02.816 --> 13:04.684
HE WOULD NOT BE LYING IN THERE
ON LIFE SUPPORT.

13:04.717 --> 13:06.553
DANIEL,
THIS IS NOT YOUR FAULT.

13:06.586 --> 13:08.255
OKAY, YOU DIDN'T
POISON THOSE MEN.

13:08.288 --> 13:10.057
AND WE CAN STILL CATCH THE GUY
WHO DID THIS

13:10.090 --> 13:11.591
BEFORE HE HITS
SOMEONE ELSE.

13:11.624 --> 13:14.828
HAVE YOU GOTTEN AHOLD
OF MR. ANDERSON'S WIFE?

13:14.862 --> 13:18.098
SHE'S ON A PLANE.
SHE'LL BE HERE IN AN HOUR.

13:18.131 --> 13:21.234
I DON'T KNOW
IF HE'LL LAST THAT LONG.

13:21.268 --> 13:22.569
CAN WE TALK TO HIM?

13:22.602 --> 13:23.937
HE'S GONE INTO A COMA.

13:25.172 --> 13:26.706
THAT DOESN'T
NECESSARILY MEAN

13:26.739 --> 13:28.608
WE CAN'T TRY TO ASK HIM
SOME QUESTIONS.

13:35.115 --> 13:38.418
MR. ANDERSON,
MY NAME IS DR. DANIEL PIERCE.

13:38.451 --> 13:40.120

ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENED TO YOU.

YOU'VE BEEN POISONED.

13:41.855 --> 13:43.756

EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO HELP YOU.

13:43.790 --> 13:45.658

FROM COLORADO RIGHT NOW.

IN THE MEANTIME,
WE NEED YOUR HELP

13:48.195 --> 13:51.431
CATCHING WHOEVER IT IS
THAT TRIED TO KILL YOU.

13:51.464 --> 13:54.101
I'M GONNA ASK YOU
A SERIES OF QUESTIONS.

13:54.134 --> 13:56.636
WHEN YOU WANT
TO ANSWER "YES,"

13:56.669 --> 13:58.471
THINK ABOUT
THROWING A BASEBALL.

13:58.505 --> 14:03.944
AND FOR "NO," THINK ABOUT
SINGING "HAPPY BIRTHDAY."

14:03.977 --> 14:05.778
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

14:11.051 --> 14:12.785
THAT'S THE CEREBELLUM,
THE REGION OF THE BRAIN

14:12.819 --> 14:14.287
RESPONSIBLE FOR HAND-EYE
COORDINATION.

14:14.321 --> 14:15.788
HE'S THINKING
ABOUT THROWING A BASEBALL.

14:15.822 --> 14:17.624
THIS IS EXTRAORDINARY.

14:17.657 --> 14:19.159
SO HE'S SAYING "YES."

14:19.192 --> 14:21.328
DO YOU KNOW
WHO ATTACKED YOU?

14:22.896 --> 14:24.697
THAT'S THE MEDIAL
PRE-FRONTAL CORTEX.

14:24.731 --> 14:26.533
WHERE WE STORE OUR MEMORIES
OF MUSIC.

14:26.566 --> 14:28.668
HE'S THINKING ABOUT SINGING
"HAPPY BIRTHDAY."

14:28.701 --> 14:30.803
SO HE'S SAYING "NO," HE DOESN'T
KNOW WHO ATTACKED HIM.

14:30.837 --> 14:33.373
DO YOU KNOW A LAWYER
NAMED THOMAS SCANTLIN?

14:33.406 --> 14:35.042
"YES."

14:35.075 --> 14:37.978
DO YOU KNOW MR. SCANTLIN
IN A PERSONAL CAPACITY?

14:38.011 --> 14:40.047
"NO."

14:40.080 --> 14:43.150
IN A PROFESSIONAL
CAPACITY?

14:43.183 --> 14:45.152
"YES."

14:45.185 --> 14:46.486
MR. SCANTLIN
WAS ATTACKED YESTERDAY

14:46.519 --> 14:47.654
THE SAME WAY YOU WERE.

14:47.687 --> 14:50.257
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHY?

14:52.059 --> 14:53.826
"YES."

14:53.860 --> 14:57.164
MR. ANDERSON, I'M GONNA ASK YOU
TO SPELL OUT THAT REASON.

14:57.197 --> 14:58.565
I'LL RUN THROUGH THE ALPHABET
LETTER BY LETTER,

14:58.598 --> 15:01.401
AND WHEN I SAY A LETTER
THAT'S CORRECT,

15:01.434 --> 15:03.236
I WANT YOU THINK ABOUT
THROWING THAT BASEBALL.

15:03.270 --> 15:04.437
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

15:05.738 --> 15:08.541
OKAY. HERE WE GO.

15:08.575 --> 15:10.210
"A"...

15:10.243 --> 15:12.479
"D," "E"...

15:13.880 --> 15:16.883
GOT IT.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.718
"DA-FOE." "DAFOE."
I MEAN, IT COULD BE A LAST NAME.

15:18.751 --> 15:22.522
IS THAT RIGHT, MR. ANDERSON?
IS DAFOE SOMEBODY THAT YOU --

16:00.593 --> 16:03.796
MR. DAFOE,
THANK YOU FOR COMING IN.

16:03.830 --> 16:05.465
OF COURSE. YEAH.

16:05.498 --> 16:07.767
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE
RUSS ANDERSON'S DEAD.

16:07.800 --> 16:08.935
HE HAD CHILDREN.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.603
TOM SCANTLIN, TOO.

16:10.637 --> 16:12.705
YOU WERE FRIENDS?

16:12.739 --> 16:14.474
MORE BUSINESS ACQUAINTANCES,
REALLY.

16:14.507 --> 16:16.976
A LUNCH OR TWO A YEAR

16:17.010 --> 16:19.512
AND SHARE A TABLE
AT A CHARITY EVENT,

16:19.546 --> 16:20.880
THAT SORT OF THING.

16:20.913 --> 16:23.316
WE ASKED MR. ANDERSON
IF HE HAD ANY IDEA

16:23.350 --> 16:25.785
WHY HE AND MR. SCANTLIN
WERE TARGETED,

16:25.818 --> 16:28.088
AND THE ONLY THING
HE COULD GIVE US

16:28.121 --> 16:30.023
BEFORE HE DIED
WAS YOUR NAME.

16:30.057 --> 16:31.258
MY NAME?

16:32.325 --> 16:35.995
WAIT, YOU DON'T THINK I HAD
SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE K--

16:36.029 --> 16:39.332
NO. NO. THE KILLER
SEEMS TO HAVE A GRIEVANCE
AGAINST POWERFUL MEN.

16:39.366 --> 16:42.302
YOUR BEING THE C.E.O. OF A
GLOBAL AGRICULTURAL CONGLOMERATE

16:42.335 --> 16:44.137
CERTAINLY PUTS YOU
IN THAT CLUB.

16:44.171 --> 16:46.306
BUT THE KILLER'S
ALSO MADE IT CLEAR

16:46.339 --> 16:49.176
THAT HE HAS THREE MORE VICTIMS
ON HIS LIST.

16:49.209 --> 16:50.243
OH, MY GOD.

16:50.277 --> 16:52.479
WHAT WE NEED
TO DO NOW IS

16:52.512 --> 16:55.482
DETERMINE WHAT POSSIBLY
CONNECTS THE THREE OF YOU

16:55.515 --> 16:58.818
SO WE CAN GET A BETTER IDEA
OF WHO THIS KILLER MIGHT BE.

16:58.851 --> 17:00.420
WELL, CHICAGO'S ULTIMATELY
A SMALL TOWN.

17:00.453 --> 17:02.422
WE'VE DONE SO MUCH BUSINESS
TOGETHER OVER THE YEARS.

17:02.455 --> 17:05.458
DID ANY OF THAT BUSINESS
SCREW SOMEBODY SO BADLY

17:05.492 --> 17:07.827
THAT THEY'D WANT TO SEE ALL
THREE OF YOU FAT CATS DEAD?

17:07.860 --> 17:09.028
I-I'M SORRY,

17:09.062 --> 17:11.364
SORRY.
THIS IS DR. DANIEL PIERCE.

17:11.398 --> 17:15.068
HE'S A SPECIAL CONSULTANT

17:15.102 --> 17:17.170
HE GETS A LITTLE PASSIONATE

17:17.204 --> 17:19.839
WHAT HE'S
TRYING TO ASK IS,

17:19.872 --> 17:23.343
COULD ANY OF YOUR DEALINGS
WITH MR. SCANTLIN OR ANDERSON

17:23.376 --> 17:26.946
HAVE POSSIBLY GIVEN ANYONE
MOTIVE FOR MURDER?

17:26.979 --> 17:30.083
WELL, SCANTLIN'S FIRM
DREW UP THE I.P.O.

17:30.117 --> 17:31.818
THAT WE DID LAST YEAR,

17:31.851 --> 17:35.455
AND A DIVISION OF ANDERSON'S
BANK HANDLED THE OFFERING.

17:35.488 --> 17:39.058
AND WHAT ABOUT THAT
WOULD HAVE SET SOMEONE OFF?

17:39.092 --> 17:41.361
WE HAD TO LAY OFF
13 EXECUTIVES

17:41.394 --> 17:43.863
AND ABOUT 250
LOW-LEVEL EMPLOYEES.

17:43.896 --> 17:46.466
SURE, NOTHING LIKE A LITTLE

17:46.499 --> 17:48.067

THE STOCK PRICE.

17:48.101 --> 17:49.869

17:49.902 --> 17:51.571
IS STANDARD BEFORE AN I.P.O.

BREAKING A FEW EGGS, RIGHT?

17:54.006 --> 17:55.308
NO, YOU CAN'T.

17:55.342 --> 17:57.744
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
WE'RE GONNA NEED A LIST

17:57.777 --> 18:03.416
OF THOSE 263 EMPLOYEES,
INCLUDING THE LOW-LEVEL ONES.

18:05.252 --> 18:08.087
ANOTHER NEEDLE
IN ANOTHER HAYSTACK.

18:08.121 --> 18:10.590
MEANWHILE, THE KILLER
COULD BE AT THE POST OFFICE,

18:10.623 --> 18:12.925
DROPPING HIS NEXT DELIVERY
DOWN THE MAIL SLOT.

18:12.959 --> 18:14.894
Daniel: I'LL SEND HIM
ANOTHER FAN LETTER.

18:14.927 --> 18:16.396
MAYBE HE'LL SEND ME
ANOTHER CLUE.

18:16.429 --> 18:18.064
MAYBE THIS TIME I'LL FIGURE
IT OUT FAST ENOUGH.

18:18.097 --> 18:20.066
ALL RIGHT, I'LL LOG BACK
ONTO THE THREAD.

18:20.099 --> 18:23.336
OKAY. UH, NO CODE THIS TIME --
JUST MESSAGE.

18:23.370 --> 18:25.572
UH, "NOW I UNDERSTAND.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.407
"YOU'RE DOWNSIZING

18:27.440 --> 18:28.941
"THE SAME WAY
THEY DOWNSIZED YOU.

18:28.975 --> 18:31.611
WHO'S NEXT?
YOURS, KINDRED."

"FRONT-PAGE NEWS."

28:35.181 --> 28:38.050
JUST LIKE HE SAID.

28:38.084 --> 28:41.821
I TRIED TO CALL HIM
AFTER I READ ABOUT SCANTLIN,

28:41.854 --> 28:43.823
BUT HIS PHONE WAS TURNED OFF.

28:43.856 --> 28:45.892

THE POLICE.

TO TURN HIM IN.

AFTER THIS ALL WENT DOWN,

28:58.737 --> 29:00.572

29:00.606 --> 29:05.077
BUT I SWEAR TO YOU,
HE'S A GOOD BOY.

IN OVER A MONTH.

TO HIS APARTMENT, EITHER.

WE NEED TO FIND HIM
BEFORE SOMEONE ELSE DIES.

29:27.967 --> 29:31.303
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHERE HE IS?

29:33.405 --> 29:36.742
THERE'S A -- THERE'S A PLACE
HE USED TO LIKE TO GO TO THINK.

29:38.344 --> 29:40.146

OF OUR OLD FARM.

BUT HE DID NOT MEAN TO KILL
AN INNOCENT COLLEGE STUDENT,

OR CONFLICTED.

38:14.860 --> 38:16.862
YOU LIED TO ME BEFORE.

38:18.797 --> 38:21.066
HOW DO I KNOW
YOU'RE NOT LYING TO ME NOW?

38:21.099 --> 38:22.368
I GOT THE SHTAKE IT.

38:23.469 --> 38:25.236
EDDIE,
GET AWAY FROM THAT WINDOW!

38:25.971 --> 38:27.573
GOD!

38:35.280 --> 38:37.516
WHY THE [BLEEP]
DID YOU DO THAT, HUH?

38:39.084 --> 38:41.553
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST
LET THEM KILL ME?

38:41.587 --> 38:44.222
BECAUSE I MEANT
WHAT I SAID, EDDIE.

38:44.255 --> 38:46.658
NOBODY ELSE HAS TO DIE.

38:54.833 --> 38:57.736
I COULD STILL
PUSH THIS BUTTON.

38:57.769 --> 39:00.606
YEAH, YOU CAN.

39:04.142 --> 39:05.911
BUT I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE GOING TO.

39:22.694 --> 39:25.196
COME ON. COME ON. COME ON.
WHAT THE [BLEEP] GOING ON?

39:35.340 --> 39:36.908
HOLD YOUR FIRE!

39:36.942 --> 39:38.276
HE'S SURRENDERING!

39:38.309 --> 39:40.512
HE LEFT
THE DETONATOR INSIDE!

39:40.546 --> 39:42.814
GO! GO! GO! GO!

39:42.848 --> 39:45.651
[ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ]

39:46.718 --> 39:50.221
YOU DID THE RIGHT THING,
EDDIE.

39:56.662 --> 39:58.430
[ EDDIE GRUNTS ]

39:58.464 --> 40:00.432
YEP.YOU OKAY?

40:00.466 --> 40:01.633
YOU SURE?

40:01.667 --> 40:03.802
YEAH. THAT --

40:03.835 --> 40:05.437
THAT COULD HAVE GONE
A WHOLE DIFFERENT WAY.

40:05.471 --> 40:06.805
I KNEW YOU WERE CRAZY.

40:06.838 --> 40:08.507
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE THAT CRAZY.

40:08.540 --> 40:10.442
YEAH. ME NEITHER.

40:13.912 --> 40:16.548
Daniel:
WHAT IS A CONSCIENCE?

40:16.582 --> 40:22.554
IS IT SOMETHING WE CAN LOCATE
ON AN MRI?

40:22.588 --> 40:24.389
STUDIES HAVE SHOWN

40:24.422 --> 40:27.526
THAT PEOPLE WITH DAMAGE TO THE
VENTROMEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX

40:27.559 --> 40:31.463
ARE ACTUALLY MORE WILLING
TO SACRIFICE A HUMAN LIFE

40:31.497 --> 40:36.968
AS LONG AS THEY PERCEIVE THAT
IT'S FOR SOME GREATER GOOD.

40:37.002 --> 40:39.738
BUT WHAT ABOUT PEOPLE
WHO HAVE NO TROUBLE

40:39.771 --> 40:42.741
SACRIFICING OTHERS
TO THEIR OWN SELFISH ENDS?

40:42.774 --> 40:46.111
IS HEARTLESS CRUELTY
OUR TRUE NATURE

40:46.144 --> 40:48.480
AND EMPATHY THE ABERRATION?

40:48.514 --> 40:51.683
MY GRANDMOTHER USED TO SAY,
"IT'S NICE TO BE NICE."

40:51.717 --> 40:53.251
AND THAT MAY BE TRUE.

40:53.284 --> 40:56.121
OR ARE WE BETTER OFF
SPENDING EVERY WAKING MOMENT

40:56.154 --> 40:59.457
TENDING OUR OWN SELFISH NEEDS?

40:59.491 --> 41:00.926
THE GOOD NEWS IS,

41:00.959 --> 41:03.361
IT TURNS OUT THERE'S
AN EVOLUTIONARY ADVANTAGE

41:03.394 --> 41:05.196
TO SIMPLE HUMAN KINDNESS.

41:05.230 --> 41:07.198
WE COULDN'T GET THROUGH
A COLD PALEOLITHIC WINTER

41:07.232 --> 41:09.501
WITHOUT A LITTLE COOPERATION.

41:09.535 --> 41:14.506
STILL, ON SOME PREHISTORIC LEVEL
WE'RE ALL LONE HUNTERS.

41:14.540 --> 41:17.509
SO IT CAN FEEL DANGEROUS
TO SHOW ANY SOFTNESS

41:17.543 --> 41:19.645
TO OTHER MEMBERS OF THE TRIBE.

41:25.283 --> 41:28.286
BUT IF WE MANAGE TO LAY DOWN OUR
CLUBS AND OUR SHARPENED ROCKS,

41:28.319 --> 41:33.592
ANSWERING THE CALL
OF THE ALTRUISTIC IMPERATIVE

41:33.625 --> 41:36.361
CAN BE ITS OWN REWARD.
