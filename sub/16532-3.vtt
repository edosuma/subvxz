15:44.590 --> 15:46.830
it's great that you're letting
dwight live with you.

You're taking
dwight in?

at the concession stand.

How long were you
working on that one?

15:58.840 --> 16:02.480
Is that one of the gems that
you wrote into luke's speech?

I will have you know
that luke wrote his own speech.

like nicki minaj?

16:21.360 --> 16:23.530
My mom and jay said
it made me more relatable.

I feel like an idiot.

16:24.630 --> 16:26.600
Yeah. Me too.

16:26.600 --> 16:29.200
My mom forced me to wear this
so I'd be more like you.

Yeah, because I'd wear
a brown belt with black shoes?

16:31.940 --> 16:33.310
You know what
we should do?

16:33.310 --> 16:35.510
Throw out our speeches
and speak from the heart.

16:35.510 --> 16:38.280
That's a great idea.

didn't you?

Luke and I are here
because we each want your votes.

want to change us

into being something
each of us is not.

17:44.910 --> 17:47.550
They're publicly
shaming us.
We deserve it.

17:47.550 --> 17:49.380
The important thing is
you two leaned something.

17:49.390 --> 17:50.850
Save it, patriarch.

17:50.850 --> 17:53.220
The point is,
we are two individuals

and ideas.

Oh.
Any one of these people
could buy this house.

18:28.320 --> 18:31.590
And if they do, you give us
a percentage of your commission.

we make money.
