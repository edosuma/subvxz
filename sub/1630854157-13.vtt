Gene, they're coming.

They're coming fast, Gene.

Start recording, Gene. Gene!

00:51.701 --> 00:53.944
Chris, your mother and I
divided all our stuff

00:54.113 --> 00:55.295
after a recent argument,

00:55.447 --> 00:57.705
and I came across
something very special:

00:57.800 --> 00:59.892
the Nintendo NES.

01:01.287 --> 01:04.121
This is a day I've been
waiting for for 30 years,

01:04.139 --> 01:06.623
and now, I get to share it
with my son.

01:06.642 --> 01:09.717
Get ready for the greatest
video game of all time,

01:09.812 --> 01:11.052
<i> Donkey Kong.</i>

01:11.146 --> 01:13.363
('80s video game music playing)

01:15.134 --> 01:18.635
-This game sucks.
-What are you talking about?

01:18.654 --> 01:21.413
Uh, what universe does this
even take place in?

01:21.565 --> 01:23.824
Everything needs to take place
in a universe.

01:23.976 --> 01:26.993
It's a warehouse with ladders
where a monkey took a girl.

01:27.088 --> 01:29.162
What about
the micro-transactions

01:29.315 --> 01:31.256
that slowly bankrupt our family?

01:31.483 --> 01:34.576
Or the children slinging racist
taunts into your earpiece?

01:34.595 --> 01:37.504
It has two buttons, and I have
to look down when I press them.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.080
<i> Donkey Kong</i> sucks.

01:39.174 --> 01:42.008
I could build the same game
on our house.

01:42.161 --> 01:44.520
-(music stops)
<i> -Donkey Kong</i> house?

01:48.334 --> 01:50.016
Sorry I put you
in a dress, Stewie.

01:50.111 --> 01:52.778
-We needed a damsel.
-Hey, do I look upset?

01:52.929 --> 01:54.113
What do we got today?

01:54.340 --> 01:56.431
Looks like
a<i> Donkey Kong</i> house.

01:56.600 --> 01:58.283
(sighs) What a mess.

01:58.435 --> 02:00.527
-Want a beer?
-Yes, sir.

02:00.621 --> 02:02.287
-Is that a YETI?
-It is.

02:02.439 --> 02:04.289
You mind if I talk about it
for 45 minutes?

02:04.441 --> 02:06.199
Oh, I know I can't stop you.

02:06.293 --> 02:09.035
-('80s video game music playing)
-Barrel.

02:09.130 --> 02:12.339
Barrel. Barrel.

02:13.634 --> 02:15.467
What is all this noise?

02:15.619 --> 02:18.028
I'm trying to buy everything
on Amazon in here.

02:18.121 --> 02:19.263
PETER:
Barrel.

02:20.290 --> 02:23.142
Ah! My foot.
Oh, I think it's broken.

02:23.293 --> 02:24.977
Uh-oh. Next level.

02:25.128 --> 02:27.729
(imitates
<i> Donkey Kong</i> sound effects)

02:33.212 --> 02:35.988
(sighs) The doctor said
I'm gonna be laid up for a week,

02:36.139 --> 02:37.972
so you'll have
to take care of the kids,

02:37.992 --> 02:40.159
but that'll give you
some quality time

02:40.386 --> 02:42.219
with them, huh?
Are you excited?

02:42.312 --> 02:43.978
No, and you know that.

02:43.998 --> 02:45.647
Are you brushing
with a grill brush?

02:45.666 --> 02:49.059
I left my toothbrush
at a hotel three years ago.

02:49.077 --> 02:51.003
Look, now, don't worry,
it's just a week,

02:51.154 --> 02:53.154
and taking care of kids
is not that hard.

02:53.174 --> 02:55.248
The Facebook status
of every girl

02:55.401 --> 02:57.417
I went to high school with
would disagree.

02:57.511 --> 02:59.845
Plus, you know I'm not very good
at taking care of things.

02:59.996 --> 03:01.922
Remember, I even lost custody
of our orchid.

03:02.016 --> 03:04.382
Please, you can't take my baby.

03:04.535 --> 03:06.910
-How often did you water her?
-Every day.

03:06.929 --> 03:09.262
-Every day?
-I thought water was good.

03:09.415 --> 03:11.915
Not that much. What about sun?

03:11.934 --> 03:13.174
I put it in the front window.

03:13.194 --> 03:15.194
A western-facing window?

03:15.421 --> 03:19.180
That's direct, afternoon
sunlight, you... monster!

03:19.200 --> 03:20.682
It's not worth it, O'Malley.

03:20.743 --> 03:24.594
Why do these guys get to have
one while me and Molly...

03:24.613 --> 03:28.114
-(sniffles)
-Hey, it's gonna happen
for you and Molly, I know it.

03:28.267 --> 03:29.449
Stress doesn't help.

03:29.601 --> 03:30.858
Why don't you guys
come over tonight?

03:31.027 --> 03:32.285
We'll hang out on the patio.

03:32.362 --> 03:35.697
Yeah, okay. That sounds nice.

03:35.716 --> 03:37.031
Want me to bring anything?

03:37.092 --> 03:39.033
How about the food
and the drinks?

03:39.127 --> 03:42.429
That feels like everything,
but okay.

03:47.728 --> 03:48.727
Breakfast?

03:48.878 --> 03:50.395
You're supposed
to make breakfast.

03:50.564 --> 03:52.064
Oh, right.

03:54.960 --> 03:55.976
(groans)

03:56.128 --> 03:57.310
Maybe we should
go out for food.

03:57.404 --> 03:59.463
Having a little trouble
this morning?

03:59.481 --> 04:00.647
No, no, I'm doing great.

04:00.741 --> 04:03.483
Look, I already got
Stewie and Brian changed.

04:03.635 --> 04:05.244
BOTH:
Ow.

04:05.395 --> 04:08.396
Okay, maybe I'm having
a little trouble, but I'm a dad.

04:08.474 --> 04:10.749
The only thing I know
how to use is a Shop-Vac.

04:10.900 --> 04:12.918
I already made myself
some toast,

04:13.069 --> 04:15.295
so I don't need your help.

04:16.999 --> 04:19.716
Dads need to eat first.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.265
Get out.

04:26.374 --> 04:28.767
There's a grenade in here.

04:28.994 --> 04:30.102
Use it to get a better lunch.

04:30.329 --> 04:32.846
I got a sandwich in mine.

04:32.998 --> 04:35.348
You got the wrong bag.

04:35.517 --> 04:37.442
(sighs)

04:37.594 --> 04:39.736
Finally.

04:41.097 --> 04:43.699
Aw, crap, three kids.

04:49.865 --> 04:51.272
(grunts)

04:51.366 --> 04:53.333
(panting)

04:55.687 --> 04:58.130
I don't know what
I'm supposed to bring in.

05:00.375 --> 05:02.192
You're doing a great job, Dad.

05:02.285 --> 05:04.878
-So cute.
-#DanceLikeADad.

05:04.972 --> 05:06.788
I'm waving to someone
behind you.

05:06.882 --> 05:09.123
Wow, everybody's being so nice.

05:09.143 --> 05:11.201
Hey, we normally order
at the counter,

05:11.294 --> 05:13.294
but it looks like you've got
your hands full today.

05:13.463 --> 05:14.554
What can I get you?

05:14.648 --> 05:16.297
Can you stuff
a blueberry muffin into a cup

05:16.317 --> 05:17.816
and pour coffee all over it?

05:17.967 --> 05:21.486
Normally, no, but I can't say
"no" to a super dad like you.

05:21.638 --> 05:23.822
Where's this little guy's mom?
Is she coming in, too?

05:23.973 --> 05:24.990
No, she's not with us.

05:25.159 --> 05:27.217
Oh, my, she's dead?
I'm so sorry.

05:27.310 --> 05:29.995
-Oh, actually...
-Is there anything else
I can bring you?

05:30.222 --> 05:32.164
We make a great homemade
banana cream pie.

05:32.315 --> 05:33.332
It's on the house.

05:33.559 --> 05:35.575
Uh... yeah.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.151
My wife is dead.

05:37.171 --> 05:38.411
I'll have that pie.

05:38.564 --> 05:40.897
-I'll bring it right away.
-(sighs)

05:40.916 --> 05:42.749
-Is everything okay?
-Uh...

05:42.901 --> 05:44.843
I'll never forget
her last words,

05:45.070 --> 05:48.421
"Get free extra whipped cream
on your Frappuccino."

05:48.515 --> 05:51.516
It already comes
with a lot of whipped cream.

05:51.668 --> 05:54.019
(crying): She was very specific
about more.

06:01.862 --> 06:03.177
There he is.

06:03.197 --> 06:05.605
How's the week going
as the solo dad?

06:05.757 --> 06:08.182
And how is Lois' foot?

06:08.276 --> 06:10.927
I'm not rooting for her
to lose it, but...

06:10.946 --> 06:12.562
Are you guys about to talk
about your kids?

06:12.564 --> 06:15.189
You said I can look at my phone
when you talk about your kids.

06:15.209 --> 06:18.043
This is the closest
I've ever been to Mr. Quagmire.

06:18.194 --> 06:19.360
He's wearing makeup.

06:19.380 --> 06:21.438
You know, I thought this week
was gonna suck,

06:21.531 --> 06:24.457
but everywhere I go people
are super helpful and nice.

06:24.551 --> 06:26.218
That's because
you're a dad alone.

06:26.445 --> 06:29.145
That's the closest thing
people get to seeing a hero.

06:29.147 --> 06:30.780
It's right after wounded veteran

06:30.799 --> 06:32.206
or ugly person who sings well.

06:32.300 --> 06:34.709
Totally. A mom alone
with her kids is a mess,

06:34.803 --> 06:37.729
but when a woman sees a dad
doing the same thing,

06:37.881 --> 06:39.456
total panty dropper.

06:39.474 --> 06:40.624
Ew, Joe.

06:40.717 --> 06:42.792
I've also been lying
about Lois being dead

06:42.794 --> 06:43.902
to get free things.

06:44.053 --> 06:46.387
-Thoughts?
-What kind of free things?

06:46.407 --> 06:47.239
Pie, mostly.

06:47.390 --> 06:48.798
-Good pie?
-Homemade.

06:48.892 --> 06:50.575
That's better than regular-made.

06:50.652 --> 06:53.153
Bonnie lies about me being dead
all the time. You're fine.

06:53.305 --> 06:56.322
Just as long as you share
that pie with Kirby here.

06:56.475 --> 06:58.475
-Right, little guy?
-Who's Kirby?

06:58.568 --> 07:00.902
-Your son. Kirby.
-His name is Stewie.

07:00.996 --> 07:02.812
Huh. Looks like a Kirby.

07:02.906 --> 07:04.089
No one looks like a Kirby.

07:04.316 --> 07:08.135
You'll see. I've never been
wrong about a Kirby.

07:10.580 --> 07:11.913
(bell rings)

07:11.932 --> 07:14.040
Peter? Can you come up here?

07:14.192 --> 07:15.175
Need something, Lois?

07:15.269 --> 07:17.494
Oh, well, I just need
the Apple TV remote.

07:17.512 --> 07:20.105
Well, I am great
at fetch. (laughs)

07:20.332 --> 07:22.149
Just the remote, please.

07:23.001 --> 07:24.834
Whoa. Did you feel that?

07:24.928 --> 07:27.504
(chuckles) This isn't gonna
turn into an<i> English Patient</i>

07:27.506 --> 07:29.339
-type of thing, is it?
-What does that mean?

07:29.432 --> 07:31.432
You know, caregiver and patient.

07:31.526 --> 07:34.268
A strong bond develops.
Intimacy.

07:34.362 --> 07:35.770
Oh, maybe.

07:35.864 --> 07:38.848
Our fingers did touch
when you handed me that remote.

07:38.942 --> 07:42.109
-I know.
-You know, I've been in this bed
for a long time.

07:42.129 --> 07:44.779
I... I sure could use
a sponge bath.

07:44.798 --> 07:45.872
Oh, word?

07:45.966 --> 07:49.509
Why don't you start
down by my cast?

07:51.120 --> 07:53.213
Oh, God, your leg
is covered in hair.

07:53.307 --> 07:55.532
That's right.
I can't shave down there

07:55.550 --> 07:56.958
'cause the cast will get wet.

07:56.977 --> 07:59.460
-Look at it. Smell it.
-(grunts) No.

07:59.480 --> 08:01.721
Take a deep breath and smell it.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.965
(sniffs) Ah! What is that?

08:04.059 --> 08:05.484
Four days of sweat
and a dinner fork

08:05.711 --> 08:07.969
that got stuck
when I scratched my ankle.

08:08.063 --> 08:09.212
Please, let me go.

08:09.231 --> 08:10.897
This<i> English Patient</i>
enough for you?

08:11.066 --> 08:12.324
I don't know, I never saw it.

08:12.551 --> 08:14.326
Every door you walk through
isn't a scenario

08:14.477 --> 08:16.661
you've typed
into the search bar of Pornhub.

08:16.813 --> 08:18.497
This is real life,
and it stinks.

08:18.665 --> 08:21.241
-Please, let me go.
-Now, you listen to me.

08:21.393 --> 08:23.727
-Every 90 minutes,
I'm gonna ring this bell...
-(bell rings)

08:23.745 --> 08:26.396
...and you're gonna come in
and take out a bowl of my waste.

08:26.414 --> 08:28.414
If that's us forming
a strong bond,

08:28.509 --> 08:31.918
then you and I are gonna form
a very strong bond. Now, go.

08:31.995 --> 08:34.095
(whimpers)

08:38.167 --> 08:41.335
(sniffs) Oh, buddy,
this smells like a big one.

08:41.429 --> 08:44.523
You've been feeding me nothing
but Chick-fil-A, so, yeah.

08:44.674 --> 08:48.009
-A dad's changing a diaper.
-A dad changing a diaper?

08:48.103 --> 08:49.677
No biting, Aidan.

You're the single dad,

Two feet under, yes.
The shallow graves were cheaper.

09:49.256 --> 09:52.148
I was wondering if you wanted

getting along well.

10:07.182 --> 10:10.667
Yeah. So, how long
have you had a pet cloud?

10:10.685 --> 10:13.670
That's... a skylight.

10:13.688 --> 10:14.762
Does it bite?

10:14.856 --> 10:16.522
(laughs)

10:16.675 --> 10:19.192
Do you want a beer?
I can make some snacks,

10:19.286 --> 10:21.119
maybe pull out the
popcorn machine for the kids.

10:21.270 --> 10:23.179
Or we don't tell them,

10:23.198 --> 10:26.032
and we keep all the popcorn
for ourselves.

10:26.184 --> 10:28.184
(laughs) You're fantastic.

10:28.203 --> 10:31.521
(laughs) I'm...
I'm-I'm serious, though.

10:31.614 --> 10:33.590
Hey, cheers.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.450
I'm glad we did this.

10:36.470 --> 10:39.453
Having to entertain
a kid all day is exhausting.

10:39.473 --> 10:41.197
How long have you been
doing it alone?

10:41.366 --> 10:44.033
-Ah, feels like forever.
-Yeah, I know.

10:44.202 --> 10:45.477
Doesn't get any easier.

10:45.628 --> 10:47.812
I thought that after
my late husband, Scott...

10:47.964 --> 10:50.023
(yawns) Huh?

10:51.134 --> 10:52.984
Hey, Mom, can I show
Stewie my room?

10:53.136 --> 10:55.654
-Sure.
-Yes! Come on, Stewie.

10:55.805 --> 10:56.896
Door open, bud.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.306
Dad.

10:59.326 --> 11:02.552
You know, we could make this
a regular thing.

11:02.645 --> 11:05.312
It'll take the pressure off us
having to entertain them.

11:05.332 --> 11:08.833
Yeah, I'd like that a lot.
Oh, no, your pet cloud got out.

11:08.985 --> 11:10.910
That's a-a window.

11:11.062 --> 11:13.505
So... so it'll come back?

11:17.903 --> 11:20.086
-(fly buzzing)
-Go away.

11:20.238 --> 11:22.997
-Stop it. Damn it.
-(bell rings)

11:23.016 --> 11:24.574
Need help, Mom?

11:24.592 --> 11:25.909
Can you get rid of this fly?

11:25.927 --> 11:28.353
There's a swatter in the
top drawer of the dresser.

11:28.580 --> 11:31.597
Okay, that drawer
is full of sex toys.

11:31.750 --> 11:34.083
Oh. Well, we must've moved
the fly swatter.

11:34.102 --> 11:36.510
Uh, try the middle drawer.

11:36.530 --> 11:39.013
Is this a bit?
Because that drawer

11:39.032 --> 11:41.274
is also filled to the brim
with sex toys.

11:41.426 --> 11:43.660
Sorry.
Look in the bottom drawer.

11:44.763 --> 11:46.279
Wrong again.

11:46.431 --> 11:47.747
(crying)

11:52.620 --> 11:56.122
These last few days have been
really fun for me and T.J.

11:56.274 --> 11:57.607
I really like you, Peter.

11:57.625 --> 11:59.700
It's rare that
you can relate to someone

11:59.794 --> 12:01.611
on a deeper level like we can.

12:01.629 --> 12:03.704
I know.
Can I tell you something?

12:03.798 --> 12:06.950
I know this is crazy, and
I-I don't use this word lightly,

12:07.043 --> 12:10.453
but I love the way
you cut sandwiches.

12:10.455 --> 12:13.122
Perfect triangles.
You're amazing.

12:13.141 --> 12:14.548
You're amazing, too.

12:14.568 --> 12:17.736
You've got a childish wonder
about you,

12:17.887 --> 12:19.312
just like my late husband Scott,

12:19.464 --> 12:21.906
-who used...
-(yawns) Huh?

12:22.058 --> 12:23.649
So, should we go back
to my place?

12:23.744 --> 12:24.909
Keep the playdate going?

12:25.061 --> 12:27.061
Maybe take out
the popcorn machine?

12:27.080 --> 12:28.580
Let me touch all the buttons.

12:28.731 --> 12:30.749
You can pour in the kernels.

12:30.900 --> 12:33.142
-You think I'm ready?
-No,

12:33.161 --> 12:35.295
but I'll make sure
you don't spill.

12:40.652 --> 12:42.594
(moans)

12:42.821 --> 12:45.171
I wonder what Scott
would think of this.

12:45.265 --> 12:47.432
(sighs) Give her a break.
She was acquitted.

12:53.331 --> 12:54.606
And then she kissed me.

12:54.757 --> 12:56.107
I don't know what to do.

12:56.259 --> 12:58.926
I guess lying about having
a dead wife to eat popcorn

12:58.945 --> 13:00.111
wasn't the best idea.

13:00.188 --> 13:01.595
That's a nice story, Peter.

13:01.689 --> 13:04.431
Did anyone else break
any sacraments this week?

13:04.451 --> 13:06.267
Well, there's two things
you can do from here:

13:06.361 --> 13:08.269
break it off or go full scumbag.

13:08.363 --> 13:11.681
If you're interested in going
scumbag, I sell a starter kit.

13:11.699 --> 13:13.866
It includes a second phone,
fake addresses,

13:13.943 --> 13:15.109
and some golf shirts.

13:15.128 --> 13:16.702
-I don't golf.
-Nobody does.

13:16.855 --> 13:17.962
Golf was invented purely

13:18.189 --> 13:19.947
so husbands can cheat
on their wives.

13:19.966 --> 13:22.358
A six-hour game
in a completely different town

13:22.377 --> 13:25.695
where you need special shirts?
I-I don't think so.

13:25.713 --> 13:28.381
I was only hanging out
with Becky to help with Stewie.

13:28.457 --> 13:30.700
She clearly saw it
as something else.

13:30.718 --> 13:32.977
I got to break it off
before Lois finds out.

13:33.129 --> 13:35.038
You need to break it off 'cause

13:35.172 --> 13:37.148
it's the right thing to do.

13:37.300 --> 13:38.817
When did you get glasses?

13:38.968 --> 13:41.528
You like them?
They're Kirby Parkers.

13:44.324 --> 13:46.991
"Becky, please accept this GIF

13:47.143 --> 13:50.644
"of Forrest Gump waving
on a boat as goodbye.

13:50.664 --> 13:52.388
"You are a great person,

13:52.481 --> 13:54.574
"but things are moving
a little too fast.

13:54.726 --> 13:57.985
"Almost as fast as this GIF
of Forrest Gump

13:58.004 --> 14:00.079
-running out of his driveway."
-(phone whooshes)

14:00.231 --> 14:01.297
(doorbell rings)

14:02.509 --> 14:05.902
-Surprise.
-Becky? What are you doing here?

14:05.995 --> 14:08.179
I wanted to come over
and make you dinner.

14:08.331 --> 14:09.663
It's probably been
a while since you've had

14:09.757 --> 14:11.015
a nice, home-cooked meal.

14:11.242 --> 14:12.258
You don't have to do this.

14:12.352 --> 14:15.186
-Hey, Mom Two is here.
-Hey, Stewie.

14:15.263 --> 14:17.004
What's going on? Who's this?

14:17.023 --> 14:18.915
You didn't tell me
you had a dog.

14:18.933 --> 14:21.100
He's very close
to being put down.

14:21.252 --> 14:22.585
I didn't want you
to get attached.

14:22.604 --> 14:24.863
Aw, but he's so cute.

14:25.090 --> 14:26.589
(moans)

14:26.608 --> 14:30.017
Oh, I don't care who she is.
She can stay.

14:30.036 --> 14:31.852
-(bell rings)
-I'll be right back.

14:31.872 --> 14:33.613
(grunts)

14:33.765 --> 14:35.264
Hello, dear.

14:35.358 --> 14:37.208
I heard the doorbell,
who was it?

14:37.377 --> 14:38.710
Delivery guy. We ordered dinner.

14:38.861 --> 14:41.437
-Oh, where did you order from?
-That place you hate.

14:41.456 --> 14:42.788
-Oh.
-Yeah.

14:42.957 --> 14:45.942
Well, maybe I'll just come
downstairs and join you anyway.

14:45.960 --> 14:47.034
You know,
it's been about a week,

14:47.128 --> 14:48.611
and I'm starting to feel better.

14:48.704 --> 14:49.779
Uh, no, no, no. Trust me,

14:49.797 --> 14:51.297
you-you-you don't want
to go downstairs.

14:51.449 --> 14:54.041
Uh, Brian is talking
about the Electoral College.

14:54.060 --> 14:55.618
-Oh.
-Yeah.

14:55.787 --> 14:57.896
-I'll just eat dinner up here.
-(doorbell rings)

14:58.123 --> 14:59.731
<i> Excusez moi.</i>

15:00.734 --> 15:02.475
(yelps, chuckles)

15:02.569 --> 15:06.295
Hi, I have your boner
and butt pills from Gladiator.

15:06.314 --> 15:08.740
That's supposed to be discreet.

15:08.891 --> 15:11.300
Hey, Dad. Where's Mom?

15:11.319 --> 15:14.637
Upstairs-- Uh, the big upstairs.

15:14.656 --> 15:17.916
-That's what we call heaven.
-Mm. I get it.

15:18.143 --> 15:20.401
I tell T.J. that
my late husband Scott's...

15:20.420 --> 15:22.328
-(yawns) Huh?
-(bell rings)

15:22.480 --> 15:23.479
Mom's calling.

15:23.498 --> 15:26.149
I-I told them every time
a bell rings,

15:26.317 --> 15:27.833
that's their mom saying hello.

15:27.928 --> 15:29.652
-LOIS: Help.
-Help, help. Saying-saying help.

15:29.671 --> 15:33.097
She-she died very painfully.
<i> Pardonnez moi.</i>

15:33.249 --> 15:36.750
You forgot your box
of boner and butt pills.

15:36.919 --> 15:38.478
It's discreet.

15:39.588 --> 15:40.846
(grunts)

15:40.999 --> 15:42.848
(singsongy):
Mur-der the carpet.

15:43.001 --> 15:44.591
Hello.

15:44.611 --> 15:45.777
I-- What are you doing?

15:45.928 --> 15:47.278
Can you help me down the stairs?

15:47.430 --> 15:49.113
Uh, th-the doctor said
to stay in bed a week.

15:49.265 --> 15:50.949
You know, I just need
to get out of this room.

15:51.176 --> 15:52.766
My back is killing me.

15:52.786 --> 15:54.510
(inhales sharply) Lois,

15:54.603 --> 15:57.029
if you stay up here
for the rest of the night,

15:57.123 --> 15:59.532
I will use
the marital tongue on you.

15:59.626 --> 16:02.126
Okay, but this time,
I get to pick the spot.

16:02.353 --> 16:04.353
In the meantime, can you just
get me the heating pad

16:04.372 --> 16:06.339
for my back? It's in the attic.

16:08.451 --> 16:10.677
-(timer dings)
-The roast.

16:12.547 --> 16:15.181
Wait a minute,
I'm not cooking dinner.

16:16.367 --> 16:18.551
Heating pad, heating pad,
heating pad...

16:18.703 --> 16:21.270
-(door closes)
-Oh, crap.

16:22.465 --> 16:24.798
Hey. H-Hey,
what are you doing, Bonnie?

16:24.818 --> 16:28.152
I told Lois I would bring her
a loaf of my sourdough bread.

16:28.304 --> 16:30.046
-She doesn't want it.
-What?

16:30.064 --> 16:31.731
I just talked to her.

16:31.883 --> 16:33.807
She's dead. Lois died. Go away.

16:33.827 --> 16:35.476
Oh, my God.

16:35.495 --> 16:38.054
What are you doing
with her washing machine?

16:38.072 --> 16:40.890
It's not for sale.
You'd need a furniture dolly

16:40.908 --> 16:42.241
to get it out
of the basement anyway.

16:42.393 --> 16:45.336
We have one. I'll give you $100.

16:45.488 --> 16:48.247
Yeah, y-- O-O-Okay.
Maybe. Maybe.

16:48.399 --> 16:49.749
Will it fit through
the bulkhead door?

16:49.843 --> 16:52.084
Yeah, it looks like it'll fit.

16:52.178 --> 16:53.753
It'll totally fit.

16:53.847 --> 16:56.347
Yeah, all right.
Let's do it. $100.

16:56.499 --> 16:59.350
Heating pad.

17:02.838 --> 17:05.732
(laughs) Ah, wonderful.

17:07.360 --> 17:09.027
(yelps)

17:11.180 --> 17:13.606
Ugh, terrific.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.199
(stomping on roof)

17:15.426 --> 17:18.094
(scoffs) Probably a prowler.
It's cool, I know him.

17:18.187 --> 17:19.746
He'll just go right into my bed.

17:21.357 --> 17:23.524
-Hey.
-Hey, Meg's eating dinner.

17:23.543 --> 17:25.117
That's cool, I'll wait.

17:25.211 --> 17:27.712
(laughing):
It's kind of my thing.

17:31.776 --> 17:33.626
How am I gonna get down?

17:33.778 --> 17:36.054
If you hold this feather,
you can fly.

17:36.205 --> 17:39.615
Really? Wow, thanks, little rat.

17:39.634 --> 17:41.467
Ow! (grunts)

17:41.619 --> 17:44.729
That's for putting locks
on your garbage cans, you dick.

17:44.956 --> 17:47.381
(gasps)

17:47.400 --> 17:48.841
Heating pad.

17:48.993 --> 17:50.884
Where did you go?
And why was your box

17:50.904 --> 17:52.645
of boner and butt pills
on the stairs?

17:52.739 --> 17:53.646
I almost tripped.

17:53.740 --> 17:54.888
Those are discreet.

17:54.982 --> 17:56.482
Now, let's get you
back upstairs.

17:56.634 --> 17:57.724
(gasps, grunts)

17:57.744 --> 17:59.243
(groans) It's all right, Peter,

17:59.395 --> 18:01.079
-just open the Calm app.
-(phone beeps)

18:01.306 --> 18:04.490
"Your credit card
has been decli..." Whee!

18:04.642 --> 18:06.826
There you are, Peter.
Are you okay?

18:06.978 --> 18:08.327
Is this your mother?

18:08.496 --> 18:11.589
I'm sorry. Who the hell are you,
and why are you holding my baby?

18:11.816 --> 18:13.499
See? Total bitch, right?

18:13.651 --> 18:16.410
Boy, this-this is gonna be
a really funny story

18:16.504 --> 18:19.171
when I tell you both separately
far away from each other.

18:19.248 --> 18:21.173
-Hey, Mom.
-Mom?

18:21.250 --> 18:22.842
Peter said you were dead.

18:22.994 --> 18:24.418
Dead? I am not dead.

18:24.587 --> 18:26.512
I was just recovering
from foot surgery,

18:26.681 --> 18:28.347
so I put him
in charge of the kids.

18:28.441 --> 18:30.833
-Now, what the hell happened?
-Heating pad?

18:30.926 --> 18:32.259
I cannot believe this, Peter.

18:32.278 --> 18:33.945
You've been lying to me?

18:34.096 --> 18:35.613
I thought we had something.

18:35.764 --> 18:38.282
And what kind of a mother
leaves their husband

18:38.434 --> 18:41.101
with the kids for a week?
It is a miracle they're alive.

18:41.121 --> 18:43.846
-Excuse me?
-I'll tell you
what kind of mother,

18:43.865 --> 18:45.957
the best mom there is.

18:46.184 --> 18:48.184
I'm sorry I lied to you, Becky.

18:48.202 --> 18:50.277
All I wanted was free popcorn.

18:50.296 --> 18:52.630
Taking care of kids
is relentless.

18:52.781 --> 18:53.965
There's no escape.

18:54.116 --> 18:55.782
You know, unless you
"accidentally" leave them

18:55.951 --> 18:56.876
in a hot car.

18:56.970 --> 18:58.136
I mean, you'd get less jail time

18:58.212 --> 18:59.953
than actual murder, right?

18:59.973 --> 19:02.381
And-and prison has to be
quieter than your actual life.

19:02.475 --> 19:05.201
Anyway, if I've learned
anything this week,

19:05.219 --> 19:07.628
it's that all mothers
are heroes,

19:07.722 --> 19:09.538
and the biggest hero I know

19:09.632 --> 19:12.817
is the one I'm lucky enough
to call my wife.

19:12.968 --> 19:14.134
Oh, Peter,

19:14.228 --> 19:17.613
that almost cancels out
everything you've done.

19:20.994 --> 19:24.053
Look, Becky, I don't blame you
for what happened.

19:24.071 --> 19:25.221
Nobody does.

19:25.239 --> 19:26.647
But you're a beautiful woman,

19:26.666 --> 19:30.317
you can do better than a
44-year-old morbidly obese guy.

19:30.336 --> 19:32.561
You know what, you're right.

19:32.580 --> 19:34.672
Ever since I lost
my late husband Scott, I...

19:34.823 --> 19:36.632
GRIFFINS:
(yawns) Huh?

19:40.329 --> 19:42.180
The other mom just left,
and now,

19:42.331 --> 19:44.015
Bonnie's dragging
a washing machine

19:44.166 --> 19:45.090
out from the bulkhead.

19:45.243 --> 19:47.243
(chuckles) Never a dull moment.

19:47.261 --> 19:48.853
Hey, grab me a beer
from the YETI.

19:49.080 --> 19:51.171
-You know it'll be cold, right?
-Mm-hmm.

19:51.191 --> 19:55.008
Just picture it, the place:
Dripping Springs, Texas.

19:55.102 --> 19:56.769
Roy and Ryan Seiders,

19:56.921 --> 19:59.438
brothers tired of their
conventional coolers breaking

19:59.532 --> 20:01.974
when they would stand-cast
into the Gulf Coast,

20:02.126 --> 20:03.926
took matters
into their own hands

20:04.019 --> 20:06.704
and created the cooler
to end all coolers.

20:06.931 --> 20:08.113
<i> ANNOUNCER:</i>
<i> Yeti coolers:</i>

20:08.266 --> 20:10.124
<i> for the man in your life</i>
<i> with no personality.</i>

20:15.957 --> 20:18.216
(sighs) Well, I'm glad
my foot's all healed.

20:18.367 --> 20:20.443
It's so nice
to be back downstairs.

20:20.536 --> 20:22.703
Yeah, and I'm happy
our relationship

20:22.722 --> 20:25.448
is stronger than ever, and
everything is back to normal.

20:25.541 --> 20:27.225
Well, except every time
I look out the window,

20:27.452 --> 20:30.061
the beginning of "Kiss Me"
by Sixpence None the Richer

20:30.137 --> 20:31.637
-starts playing.
