And it seems, to him,

19:41.267 --> 19:44.705
that it's a good thing to try
and help that person.

19:44.748 --> 19:49.318
It couldn't be the very, very
worst way to spend his time.

19:52.495 --> 19:55.237
-♪ Dan, you'll be
a great public defender ♪

19:55.281 --> 19:57.805
♪ You're gonna be here
forever ♪

19:57.848 --> 20:00.503
-Don't sing sentences.

20:00.547 --> 20:03.941
And I'm still just here
temporarily.

20:03.985 --> 20:06.683
But now that I am
the whole package,

20:06.727 --> 20:08.250
New York is gonna
have to brace itself

20:08.294 --> 20:11.775
for the number of criminals
I am gonna set free.

20:11.819 --> 20:15.866
-Not exactly what I had in mind
but enough to cross "Fix Dan"

20:15.910 --> 20:16.954
off my list.

20:16.998 --> 20:18.478
-I knew I was on there!

20:18.521 --> 20:20.741
-You're on there
like four more times.

20:24.875 --> 20:28.618
So, the Getty Museum Nikolai
almost had his painting in

20:28.662 --> 20:30.272
wasn't the famous one in L.A.,
it was --

20:30.316 --> 20:33.667
-It was The Estelle
Getty Museum in Miami, Florida.

20:36.235 --> 20:38.411
Apparently, Nikolai learned
American painting

20:38.454 --> 20:40.282
from watching
"Golden Girls" reruns,

20:40.326 --> 20:42.415
and that's all he can paint.

20:44.417 --> 20:47.333
I might not be a big-swing guy.

20:48.508 --> 20:51.032
-I appreciate you trying.

20:51.075 --> 20:53.513
I know it probably doesn't feel
like it right at this moment,

20:53.556 --> 20:56.298
but I really believe
we're on the right track.

20:56.342 --> 20:57.821
People are starting
to buy in.

20:57.865 --> 20:59.693
And at least you made
one big improvement --

20:59.736 --> 21:01.564
you got the birds
out of the ceiling.

21:01.608 --> 21:02.696
They're finally gone.

21:02.739 --> 21:05.916
-They're not gone.

21:05.960 --> 21:07.657
They're just waiting.

21:07.701 --> 21:10.965
But next time,
I will be ready.

21:14.664 --> 21:16.187
-Hey, shouldn't he be
cleaning this up?

21:16.231 --> 21:17.319
-Are you gonna tell him?

21:17.363 --> 21:20.279
-Nope.
-Yeah.
