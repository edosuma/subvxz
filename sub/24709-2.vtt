WEBVTT

00:33.324 --> 00:34.242
MORNING, DETECTIVES.

00:34.325 --> 00:35.952
AND A VERY GOOD MORNING
TO YOU.

00:36.411 --> 00:37.787
WHAT'S THE STORY?

00:37.871 --> 00:40.165
BAR'S ROBBED,
ONE OF THE STICKUP MEN
SHOT THIS GUY.

00:40.248 --> 00:42.751
FROM THE LOOK OF IT,
HE MUST HAVE BEEN TRYING
TO GET OUT.

00:42.834 --> 00:44.919
CAUGHT IT IN THE BACK
OF THE HEAD.

00:47.047 --> 00:48.840
"JEROME LESTER."

00:48.923 --> 00:50.216
40 BUCKS
IN HIS WALLET.

00:50.300 --> 00:51.217
THAT'S WHY HE RAN.

00:51.301 --> 00:52.260
WHAT YOU MEAN?

00:52.343 --> 00:54.054
TAKE A LOOK
AT THIS GUY'S SHOES.

00:54.137 --> 00:56.514
40 BUCKS MEANT
A LOT TO HIM.

00:56.598 --> 00:57.974
FIGURE HE RISKED HIS LIFE
FOR 40 BUCKS?

00:58.058 --> 00:59.684
MIGHT'VE BEEN WORTH
THE GAMBLE, YOU KNOW?

00:59.768 --> 01:02.687
CAN I GO NOW?
I GOTTA GET MY DAUGHTER
OFF TO SCHOOL.

01:02.771 --> 01:04.397
YOU KNOW THIS GUY?
I DON'T KNOW HIM.

01:04.481 --> 01:05.565
YOU SEE WHO SHOT HIM?
NOPE.

01:05.648 --> 01:06.858
WASN'T LOOKING.

01:06.941 --> 01:10.487
THEY SHOT THE HELL
OUT OF HIM,
DIDN'T THEY?

01:10.570 --> 01:12.113
CAN I LEAVE NOW?
I GOTTA GET TO WORK.

01:12.197 --> 01:13.198
NOBODY'S LEAVING.

01:13.281 --> 01:14.866
WELL, HOW LONG YOU
GONNA KEEP ME HERE?

01:14.949 --> 01:16.326
YOU KNOW,
THE LEAST YOU CAN DO
IS BUY THE DRINKS.

01:16.409 --> 01:18.286
FORGET IT.
JUST GET OUT OF HERE.

01:19.954 --> 01:23.124
NEW YORK'S FINEST.
DON'T SAY MUCH FOR NEW YORK.

01:23.208 --> 01:25.001
GO ON.
GET OUT OF HERE.

01:25.085 --> 01:26.878
ANY OF
THE OTHER ONES HERE

01:26.961 --> 01:29.130
GONNA BE
SOBER ENOUGH
TO MAKE A STATEMENT?

01:29.214 --> 01:30.799
ALL RIGHT,
CUT OUT THE DRINKING.

01:30.882 --> 01:31.883
WELL, IT'S A LITTLE LATE
FOR THAT.

01:31.966 --> 01:33.051
YOU SHOULD HAVE
SUSPENDED SERVICE

01:33.134 --> 01:34.385
THE MINUTE
YOU WALKED IN HERE.

01:34.469 --> 01:36.221
THEY SAW THE GUY GET SHOT.
THEY ALL NEED A DRINK.

01:36.304 --> 01:37.889
THESE ARE
YOUR HARD-CORE BOOZERS
IN HERE THIS EARLY.

01:37.972 --> 01:39.182
YOU'RE MAKING
EXCUSES FOR THEM?

01:39.265 --> 01:41.017
ALL OF THEM GOT
THEIR OWN EXCUSE.

01:41.101 --> 01:42.227
NO, I'M JUST SAYING.

01:42.310 --> 01:44.604
ONE THING I HATE
IS A DRUNK WITNESS.

01:44.687 --> 01:45.688
LOOK OUT.

01:46.856 --> 01:48.066
Man: DETECTIVE.

01:48.149 --> 01:51.152
ANY OF THIS POLICE TECHNIQUE
COMING BACK TO YOU?

01:51.319 --> 01:52.237
HEY, SIR,

01:52.403 --> 01:54.155
PUT THE BOTTLE DOWN.

01:54.239 --> 01:55.490
I'M DETECTIVE SIPOWICZ.

01:55.573 --> 01:57.033
THIS IS
DETECTIVE SIMONE.

01:57.117 --> 01:58.368
WE WANNA KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED HERE.

01:58.451 --> 02:00.411
AND DON'T BE GIVING
THESE PEOPLE NO MORE DRINKS.

02:00.495 --> 02:01.496
THERE WAS 3 OF THEM.

02:01.579 --> 02:03.414
ONE OF THEM CAME
AROUND THE BAR

02:03.498 --> 02:04.666
AND EMPTIED
THE CASH REGISTER.

02:04.749 --> 02:07.377
THEN THEY SHOT THE MAN,
AND THEY ALL RAN OUT.

02:07.460 --> 02:08.962
WHY'D THEY SHOOT HIM?

02:09.045 --> 02:10.004
THEY JUST SHOT HIM.

02:10.088 --> 02:11.589
THEY TOLD US,
"DON'T NOBODY LEAVE,"

02:11.673 --> 02:12.757
AND THAT'S WHY
THEY SHOT HIM.

02:12.841 --> 02:14.509
HE WAS LEAVING?
THAT'S RIGHT.

02:14.592 --> 02:15.635
SO WHAT DID
THIS GUY LOOK LIKE,

02:15.718 --> 02:17.137
THE ONE THAT
PULLED THE TRIGGER?

02:17.220 --> 02:18.388
Old man: TALL,
HAD A HAT ON.

02:18.471 --> 02:19.430
A BLACK HAT.

02:19.514 --> 02:21.057
IT WAS A BROWN HAT.

02:21.141 --> 02:22.183
Woman: A BLACK HAT.

02:22.267 --> 02:24.185
NEVER MIND HIS HAT.
WHAT ABOUT THE GUY?

02:24.269 --> 02:25.270
WAS HE WHITE,
BLACK, OR WHAT?

02:25.353 --> 02:27.355
BLACK. IT WAS
ALL 3 OF THEM BLACK.

02:27.438 --> 02:29.315
THEY WAS
3 HARD-LOOKING GUYS,
I TELL YOU THAT.

02:29.399 --> 02:30.733
THEY WOULD HAVE KILLED ME
IN A SECOND.

02:30.817 --> 02:32.443
HOW ABOUT
THEIR AGES?

02:32.527 --> 02:34.112
LOOKED TO ME
ABOUT 30.

02:34.195 --> 02:36.656
UH, NOTHING
OUT OF THE ORDINARY
AS FAR AS APPEARANCES.

02:36.739 --> 02:39.117
RUN-OF-THE-MILL,
AS FAR AS LOOKS GO.

02:39.200 --> 02:41.661
ANYONE OVER HERE
RECOGNIZE THESE GUYS?

02:41.744 --> 02:43.163
NO.
NO.

02:43.246 --> 02:45.039
MAYBE FROM DRINKING HERE
BEFORE.

02:46.958 --> 02:47.959
I NEVER SEEN THEM.

02:48.042 --> 02:49.419
HOW MANY SHOTS FIRED?
Woman: ONE.

02:49.502 --> 02:51.129
2.
IT WAS ONE!

02:51.212 --> 02:54.465
ALL RIGHT. STOP BICKERING
ABOUT THE SHOTS, ALL RIGHT?

02:54.549 --> 02:56.176
I KNEW I SHOULDN'T
HAVE ASKED THAT.

02:56.259 --> 02:58.219
EVERYBODY GET SOME I.D.
ON THE TABLE HERE.

02:58.303 --> 03:00.305
WE'RE GONNA NEED TO
TAKE DOWN YOUR NAMES.

03:00.388 --> 03:01.556
HE WAS WEARING
A BROWN HAT

03:01.639 --> 03:03.224
WITH ONE OF THEM
LITTLE BIRD FEATHERS--

03:03.308 --> 03:05.476
SIR! SIR! SIR!

03:05.560 --> 03:07.228
WE'RE DONE
WITH THE HAT, OK?

03:07.312 --> 03:09.105
YOU GONNA TELL ME
YOU ACTUALLY MISSED THIS?

03:09.189 --> 03:11.065
WOULD'VE HAD TO
BEAT IT OUT OF ME.

03:11.149 --> 03:13.484
LET'S SEE SOME I.D.

04:30.186 --> 04:31.938
I DIDN'T REALLY
SEE HIM THAT GOOD.

04:33.314 --> 04:35.358
HE CAME OUT
FROM BEHIND ME.

04:35.441 --> 04:37.068
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
HE WAS THERE.

04:37.151 --> 04:39.696
AND I'D JUST UNLOCKED
MY DOOR

04:39.779 --> 04:41.197
AND HE GRABBED ME

04:41.281 --> 04:43.324
AND HE PUSHED ME IN...

04:43.408 --> 04:45.827
AND HE HAD HIS HAND
OVER MY MOUTH.

04:47.036 --> 04:49.163
HE GOT ME DOWN
ON THE FLOOR,

04:49.247 --> 04:52.125
AND HE SAID HE'D KILL ME
IF I SCREAMED.

04:52.208 --> 04:55.044
NOW, THE COP SAID
YOU TOLD HIM

04:55.128 --> 04:56.921
YOU COULD TELL
THE ASSAILANT WAS WHITE.

04:57.005 --> 04:59.215
I SAW HIM WHEN HE LEFT.

04:59.299 --> 05:00.717
IT WAS REALLY DARK,

05:00.800 --> 05:02.552
BUT THE LIGHT WAS
COMING IN FROM THE STREET.

05:02.677 --> 05:03.720
CAN YOU REMEMBER
ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT HIM?

05:04.304 --> 05:06.806
HE HAD, UM...AN EARRING,

05:07.265 --> 05:08.891
LIKE A HOOP.

05:09.475 --> 05:12.395
AND HE HAD
STUBBLE WHISKERS.

05:12.478 --> 05:14.605
OH, HE LOOKED...

05:14.689 --> 05:17.525
HE LOOKED LIKE HE WAS
MAYBE LATE 20s.

05:17.608 --> 05:19.152
HE MUCH TALLER
THAN YOU?

05:19.360 --> 05:21.404
WELL, IT SEEMED
LIKE HE WAS, BUT...

05:21.487 --> 05:22.697
HE WASN'T REAL BIG.

05:22.905 --> 05:24.115
MAYBE 6 FEET?

05:24.574 --> 05:26.159
YEAH, I GUESS HE WAS.

05:28.119 --> 05:29.996
I'M NOT GOING BACK
TO THAT HOTEL.

05:30.163 --> 05:33.082
I WAS ONLY STAYING THERE
TILL I FOUND AN APARTMENT.

05:33.166 --> 05:34.876
NOW I DON'T KNOW
WHERE TO GO.

05:34.959 --> 05:36.627
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF I WANT TO LIVE
IN NEW YORK ANYMORE.

05:36.711 --> 05:37.754
WHERE IS YOUR HOME,
MOLLY?

05:37.920 --> 05:39.339
PROVIDENCE.

05:39.422 --> 05:41.424
I MEAN, I HAVEN'T
BEEN HERE THAT LONG.

05:41.507 --> 05:42.842
I JUST GOT A JOB HERE,

05:42.925 --> 05:44.927
BUT MAYBE I'LL QUIT
AND MOVE BACK
TO RHODE ISLAND.

05:46.929 --> 05:49.265
ONLY I CAN'T
FACE MY PARENTS.

05:50.516 --> 05:52.727
THIS WILL KILL THEM.

05:52.810 --> 05:55.271
BUT I'M AFRAID TO GO
BACK TO THAT HOTEL.

05:55.355 --> 05:57.690
YOU'VE SEEN A COUNSELOR
HERE, HAVEN'T YOU?

05:57.774 --> 05:59.984
YEAH. SHE CAME IN HERE
A LITTLE WHILE AGO.

06:00.234 --> 06:01.694
YOU SHOULD CALL
YOUR PARENTS.

06:01.778 --> 06:03.029
WHEN YOU'RE READY
TO LEAVE HERE,

06:03.112 --> 06:04.864
THEY COULD
COME FOR YOU

06:04.947 --> 06:05.865
AND GO GET
YOUR THINGS.

06:05.948 --> 06:07.158
WOULD YOU
CALL THEM FOR ME?

06:07.367 --> 06:09.660
SURE, I'LL CALL THEM.
WHAT'S THEIR NUMBER?

06:10.787 --> 06:12.622
LOOK, I DON'T WANT THEM
TO KNOW YET.

06:12.705 --> 06:15.792
LET ME JUST THINK
ABOUT THIS A LITTLE MORE.

06:15.958 --> 06:17.627
OK.

06:20.296 --> 06:21.547
[CRYING]

06:33.142 --> 06:34.560
CAN I HELP YOU?

06:34.644 --> 06:38.022
YEAH. I WANNA SPEAK
TO THE DETECTIVES
AT THE BAR.

06:38.106 --> 06:39.357
Gina: DETECTIVE SIPOWICZ.

06:41.442 --> 06:42.485
WILL BARTLETT.

06:42.568 --> 06:43.945
I WAS AT THE BAR.

06:44.028 --> 06:46.781
SOMETHING WAS WRONG
WITH WHAT THE PEOPLE
WERE SAYING.

06:46.864 --> 06:49.575
UH, SO, WHY DON'T YOU
COME ON IN HERE.

06:52.829 --> 06:53.955
SIT DOWN.

06:56.707 --> 06:59.001
HOW DO YOU MEAN, WRONG?

06:59.085 --> 07:01.421
WELL, I SEEN THE MAN
GET SHOT,

07:01.504 --> 07:03.631
AND IT WASN'T
ONE OF THEM
STICKUP GUYS

07:03.714 --> 07:04.882
WHO DONE IT.

07:04.966 --> 07:06.384
IT WASN'T, HUH?

07:06.467 --> 07:07.844
I MEAN, EVERYBODY
SAY IT WAS,

07:07.927 --> 07:10.346
BUT I KNOW
WHAT I SEEN.

07:10.430 --> 07:11.931
IT WAS
EMMIT PURCELL.

07:12.014 --> 07:13.433
WHO'S THAT?

07:13.516 --> 07:15.101
HE COMES IN
EVERY NOW AND AGAIN,

07:15.184 --> 07:17.979
SOME KIND OF JAIL GUARD
ON RIKERS ISLAND.

07:18.062 --> 07:19.063
YOU KNOW HIM?

07:19.147 --> 07:20.523
DON'T KNOW HIM GOOD.

07:20.606 --> 07:21.774
TALKED TO HIM
A TIME OR TWO.

07:21.858 --> 07:22.900
WAS HE WITH
THESE STICKUP GUYS?

07:22.984 --> 07:24.444
NO. HE HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH THEM.

07:24.527 --> 07:26.279
HE WAS JUST
HAVING A DRINK,

07:26.362 --> 07:27.780
AND I WAS DOWN AT
HIS END OF THE BAR

07:27.864 --> 07:28.990
AND I SEEN
WHAT HAPPENED.

07:29.073 --> 07:30.783
THEY WAS STICKING
THE PLACE UP,

07:30.867 --> 07:32.702
AND I SEE PURCELL'S
HOLDING A PISTOL.

07:32.785 --> 07:34.328
AND HE WENT
AND SHOT THAT MAN.

07:34.412 --> 07:36.289
NOW, THE ROBBERS,
THEY TOOK OFF.

07:36.372 --> 07:38.249
PURCELL, HE LIT OUT
THE BACK.

07:38.332 --> 07:40.793
BUT EVERYBODY'S
TALKING HOW
THE ROBBERS DONE IT.

07:40.877 --> 07:42.753
NOW, I DON'T KNOW
WHETHER I SHOULD
STAY QUIET OR WHAT.

07:42.837 --> 07:45.756
BUT IT WAS PURCELL
SHOT THE MAN.

07:45.840 --> 07:47.425
SO THE CUSTOMERS
COVERED UP FOR HIM?

07:47.508 --> 07:49.135
NAH. MOST OF THEM
HAD THEIR HEAD DOWN.

07:49.218 --> 07:50.636
PLUS THEY'RE DRUNKS.

07:50.720 --> 07:52.889
YOU KNOW WHERE WE CAN
FIND THIS GUY PURCELL?

07:52.972 --> 07:54.390
NO, SIR, I DON'T.

07:54.474 --> 07:55.975
BUT YOU ARE SURE ABOUT
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING HERE?

07:56.058 --> 07:57.351
I KNOW WHAT I SEEN.

07:57.435 --> 07:58.811
I'M A SITUATIONAL
DRINKER,

07:58.895 --> 08:00.480
UNLIKE THEM OTHERS.

08:00.563 --> 08:03.232
FORGIVE ME.
I DON'T INQUIRE
ABOUT THE SITUATION.

08:03.316 --> 08:06.569
LET CALL THE INSPECTOR
GENERAL'S OFFICE
AT CORRECTIONS.

08:06.652 --> 08:08.070
YOU GUYS GONNA
NEED ME ANYMORE?

08:08.154 --> 08:09.989
WE GOT YOUR ADDRESS,
RIGHT?

08:10.072 --> 08:11.991
YEAH. HE TOOK IT DOWN
AT THE BAR FROM MY
DRIVER'S LICENSE.

08:12.074 --> 08:15.161
SO WE GOT THAT
IF WE NEED YOU.

08:15.244 --> 08:16.746
AM I GONNA HAVE
TO TESTIFY?

08:16.829 --> 08:17.914
WE'RE NOT SURE YET.

08:17.997 --> 08:20.333
LISTEN, WE APPRECIATE
YOUR COMING IN.

08:20.416 --> 08:22.835
YEAH. SURE.

08:23.669 --> 08:25.171
LISTEN,

08:25.254 --> 08:28.674
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
PURCELL HAD IN MIND,

08:28.758 --> 08:30.218
BUT HIM SHOOTING
THAT MAN,

08:30.301 --> 08:32.470
THAT HAD TO HAVE
BEEN A MISTAKE.

08:34.013 --> 08:36.057
THIS IS DETECTIVE SIMONE
OVER AT 15th SQUAD.

08:36.140 --> 08:39.310
I'M DOING A CHECK ON ONE
OF YOUR OFFICERS,

08:39.393 --> 08:40.686
A PURCELL.

08:44.440 --> 08:45.733
HOW'S YOUR RAPE VICTIM?

08:45.816 --> 08:46.943
OH, LOUSY.

08:47.026 --> 08:48.694
RAPED HER
AND GAVE HER
A BAD BEATING.

08:48.778 --> 08:50.363
WHITE MALE, MAYBE LATE 20s.
HOOP EARRING.

08:50.446 --> 08:51.656
MATCHES THE OTHER RAPES.

08:51.739 --> 08:52.949
IT'S GOTTA BE
THE SAME GUY.

08:53.032 --> 08:54.825
THEY OUGHTA HAVE
A SECURITY GUARD
IN THAT HOTEL,

08:54.909 --> 08:56.327
BUT THE LANDLORD
DON'T GIVE A DAMN.

08:56.410 --> 08:57.828
HE'S LIVING
SOMEPLACE IN EUROPE.

08:57.912 --> 08:59.872
PROBABLY
ON THE RIVIERA.

08:59.956 --> 09:01.290
A MONTH BETWEEN THE FIRST
AND SECOND RAPE.

09:01.374 --> 09:03.501
ONLY A WEEK BETWEEN
THIS AND THAT ONE.

09:03.584 --> 09:04.919
HANG ON.

09:07.296 --> 09:08.673
JILL.

09:08.756 --> 09:09.924
GREG.

09:18.182 --> 09:19.559
WHAT'S GOING ON, LIEU?

09:19.642 --> 09:22.061
DIANE AND JAMES ARE
WORKING ANOTHER RAPE
AT THAT HOTEL.

09:22.144 --> 09:23.604
I WANT YOU IN THERE
ON SURVEILLANCE.

09:23.688 --> 09:25.398
YOU CAN SET UP
IN A COUPLE OF ROOMS.

09:25.481 --> 09:26.899
THEY GAVE US
PERMISSION BEFORE.

09:26.983 --> 09:28.859
PLACE GOT A VIDEO
SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM?

09:28.943 --> 09:30.069
THEY GOT AN OLD
SYSTEM IN THERE,

09:30.152 --> 09:31.195
BUT THEY NEVER
BOTHER USING IT.

09:31.279 --> 09:32.738
WE CHECKED THAT OUT
ON THE LAST RAPE.

09:32.822 --> 09:35.074
ALL RIGHT. I'LL SEND
TARR AND RUE OVER THERE.

09:35.157 --> 09:36.742
THEY CAN HOOK UP MONITORS
TO THE WHOLE SYSTEM.

09:36.826 --> 09:38.869
OK, GET OVER THERE
AND START NOW.

09:38.953 --> 09:40.204
OK, BOSS.

09:42.748 --> 09:44.584
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

09:44.667 --> 09:46.127
JUST GOT A TIP
A CORRECTIONS OFFICER

09:46.210 --> 09:47.795
WAS THE SHOOTER
IN OUR BAR HOMICIDE.

09:47.878 --> 09:49.422
YOU THINK HE WAS PART
OF THE STICKUP TEAM?

09:49.505 --> 09:51.591
UH, NO. HE WAS JUST
IN THERE DRINKING.

09:51.674 --> 09:53.759
A GUY NAMED PURCELL.
WORKS OUT AT RIKERS.

09:53.843 --> 09:56.887
INSPECTOR GENERAL'S OFFICE
SAID HE'S BEEN OUT SICK
FOR THE LAST 2 MONTHS.

09:56.971 --> 09:58.681
GETS TO THE BARS
PRETTY EARLY
FOR A SICK MAN.

09:58.764 --> 09:59.724
WE'LL GO
TALK TO HIM.

09:59.807 --> 10:00.808
MAYBE THIS GUY
WAS MISTAKEN,

10:00.891 --> 10:02.059
'CAUSE EVERYBODY
ELSE IN THE JOINT

10:02.143 --> 10:04.270
SAID ONE
OF THE SKELLS
BLASTED THE GUY.

10:04.353 --> 10:06.022
HEY, BOBBY.

10:06.105 --> 10:07.940

10:08.024 --> 10:09.859
YEAH. THANKS, LIEU.

10:16.324 --> 10:17.867

10:19.035 --> 10:20.286
GOOD MORNING, JAMES.

10:20.369 --> 10:21.245
GOOD MORNING.

10:21.329 --> 10:22.788
I HOPE I DIDN'T
WORRY YOU.

10:22.872 --> 10:24.915
WHERE ARE YOU
GONNA BE SAFER
THAN AT YOUR MOTHER'S?

10:24.999 --> 10:26.792
I WAS USING
THE TIME TO THINK.

10:26.876 --> 10:29.587
YEAH, I FIGURED
AS MUCH.

10:29.670 --> 10:31.839
AND, UH, I'D LIKE
TO TELL YOU THAT...

10:31.922 --> 10:34.759
I'D VERY MUCH LIKE
TO ACCEPT YOUR PROPOSAL.

10:36.052 --> 10:38.846
YOU JUST MADE ME
THE HAPPIEST GUY
IN AMERICA, GINA.

10:38.929 --> 10:41.390
AND I WOULD VERY MUCH
LIKE TO ACCEPT.

10:41.474 --> 10:42.808
CONSIDER IT DONE.

10:42.892 --> 10:45.478
WE, UH, OWE
EACH OTHER A KISS.

10:45.561 --> 10:46.687
MINIMUM.

10:46.771 --> 10:48.397
MR. PURCELL, THIS IS
DETECTIVE BOBBY SIMONE.

10:48.481 --> 10:49.815
I'M CALLING FROM
THE 15th SQUAD.

10:49.899 --> 10:51.067
WE'RE INVESTIGATING
AN AUTOMOBILE REPORT.

10:51.150 --> 10:54.070
THE WITNESS GAVE US
YOUR LICENSE NUMBER.

10:54.153 --> 10:56.614
NO, SIR, I DON'T
KNOW ANYTHING

10:56.697 --> 10:58.783
ABOUT AN INCIDENT
AT A BAR.

10:58.866 --> 11:00.493
NO. I WAS TOLD
TO CONTACT YOU

11:00.576 --> 11:01.952
ABOUT A TRAFFIC ACCIDENT.

11:02.036 --> 11:03.245
THAT'S RIGHT.

11:05.373 --> 11:06.415
HEY, JAMES.

11:06.499 --> 11:07.958
LET'S GO.

11:08.042 --> 11:10.419
Bobby: WOULD IT BE
CONVENIENT FOR US
TO COME AROUND NOW?

11:11.504 --> 11:12.505
GREAT. GREAT.

11:12.588 --> 11:13.422
GREAT.

11:13.506 --> 11:14.674
HE BOUGHT IT?

11:14.757 --> 11:15.758
HE BOUGHT IT.

11:18.010 --> 11:19.428
WELL, SO LONG.

11:35.403 --> 11:36.779
WHAT WAS THAT?

11:36.862 --> 11:38.322
WHAT WAS THAT?

11:38.406 --> 11:39.865
THAT'S THIS.

12:04.014 --> 12:06.225
MR. PURCELL?

12:06.308 --> 12:07.685
Man: WHAT
DO YOU WANT?

12:07.768 --> 12:11.605
DETECTIVE SIMONE.
WE SPOKE ON THE PHONE.

12:11.689 --> 12:13.149
SOME OTHER TIME.

12:13.232 --> 12:15.359
I CAN'T COME
TO THE DOOR.

12:15.443 --> 12:17.403
PROBABLY TOO DRUNK.

12:17.486 --> 12:19.196
OPEN UP, MR. PURCELL.
COME ON.

12:19.280 --> 12:21.073
WE'LL STRAIGHTEN THIS OUT
REAL QUICK.

12:28.831 --> 12:29.749
DETECTIVE SIMONE.

12:29.832 --> 12:31.417
THIS IS DETECTIVE
SIPOWICZ.

12:33.753 --> 12:36.297
I'M--I'M NOT FOCUSING.

12:36.380 --> 12:37.840
DETECTIVE'S SHIELD, HUH?

12:37.923 --> 12:40.843
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU?

12:40.926 --> 12:43.554
MY HEAD'S SWIMMING.
I'M NOT FEELING GOOD.

12:43.637 --> 12:46.640
ALL RIGHT. YOU SAID
SOMETHING ABOUT
A TRAFFIC ACCIDENT?

12:46.724 --> 12:48.642
YEAH. WHY DON'T YOU
LET ME EXPLAIN
WHY WE'RE HERE.

12:48.726 --> 12:50.019
I CAN PROVE
IT WASN'T ME,

12:50.102 --> 12:51.604
'CAUSE I DON'T
DRIVE NO MORE.

12:51.687 --> 12:53.022
WHY DON'T YOU
BE QUIET

12:53.105 --> 12:54.690
AND LISTEN TO WHAT
MY PARTNER'S GONNA
TELL YOU?

12:54.774 --> 12:55.858
WE WANT TO KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED

12:55.941 --> 12:57.985
AT THAT BAR THIS MORNING,
MR. PURCELL.

12:58.068 --> 13:01.530
YEAH, EVEN IF YOU SAID
YOU DIDN'T ON THE PHONE.

13:01.614 --> 13:02.907
YEAH, WELL, WE GOT
SOME WITNESSES

13:02.990 --> 13:04.325
THAT PUT YOU THERE

13:04.408 --> 13:06.994
AND WE NEED TO HEAR
YOUR SIDE.

13:08.496 --> 13:11.957
WELL, I WAS IN THERE,
THAT'S TRUE ENOUGH.

13:13.083 --> 13:16.128
YOU SEE A ROBBERY
HAPPEN?

13:16.212 --> 13:18.255
IT'S KIND OF HARD TO SAY
WHAT ALL WENT ON THERE.

13:18.339 --> 13:20.132
THEY WAS ROBBING
THE PLACE.

13:20.216 --> 13:21.383
DID YOU RECOGNIZE THEM?

13:21.467 --> 13:22.551
I DON'T REMEMBER.

13:22.635 --> 13:24.595
YOU DON'T REMEMBER
IF YOU RECOGNIZED THEM?

13:24.678 --> 13:26.013
YEAH, UH-HUH.

13:26.096 --> 13:27.139
HEY, HEY. PAY ATTENTION.

13:27.223 --> 13:28.557
I'M ASKING, DID YOU
RECOGNIZE THEM?

13:28.641 --> 13:30.768
UM...NO.

13:30.851 --> 13:32.019
YOU DRUNK?

13:32.102 --> 13:33.521
I'M KINDA VAGUE.

13:33.604 --> 13:36.148
I MIGHT HAVE HAD
2 OR 3 DRINKS.

13:36.232 --> 13:38.442
DID YOU SEE
THE SHOOTING HAPPEN?

13:38.526 --> 13:39.443
MR. PURCELL?

13:39.527 --> 13:40.736
SHOOTING.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.279
YEAH, THE SHOOTING.
THERE WAS A SHOOTING
THERE.

13:42.363 --> 13:44.406
DID YOU SEE IT
HAPPEN?

13:44.490 --> 13:46.325
THIS YOUR WEAPON?

13:48.661 --> 13:52.540
UH, YES.
I'M A CORRECTIONS OFFICER.

13:52.623 --> 13:53.749
RIKERS ISLAND.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.251
THAT'S RIGHT.

13:55.334 --> 13:56.418
DID YOU HAVE THIS
WITH YOU AT THE BAR?

13:56.502 --> 13:59.088
WELL, I TAKE IT
WHEN I GO OUT.

13:59.171 --> 14:02.508
YOU GOT AN EXPENDED ROUND
IN HERE, PURCELL.

14:02.591 --> 14:04.593
YOU WANT TO TELL ME
ABOUT THAT?

14:04.677 --> 14:07.054
HMM? WHEN'D YOU
FIRE THIS BULLET?

14:07.137 --> 14:09.598
WHEN DID YOU FIRE
THIS BULLET?

14:09.682 --> 14:12.184
I'M ASKING YOU
FOR SOME ANSWERS!

14:12.268 --> 14:14.812
A CUSTOMER GOT
SHOT DEAD IN THAT BAR,

14:14.895 --> 14:17.731
WHICH WE GOT A WITNESS
SAYS HE SAW YOU SHOOT.

14:17.815 --> 14:20.609
NOW YOU BETTER
START EXPLAINING
THIS EMPTY CASING.

14:20.693 --> 14:21.819
LOOK--LOOK...

14:21.902 --> 14:24.280
I'M A DYING MAN.

14:24.363 --> 14:28.951
I GOT CANCER OF
THE PANCREATIC GLAND...

14:29.034 --> 14:31.996
AND THEY CAN'T OPERATE.

14:35.165 --> 14:36.667
DO YOU HEAR
WHAT I'M SAYING?

14:36.750 --> 14:40.504
AND I'M LOADED
ON PAIN MEDICATION.

14:42.548 --> 14:44.925
I WAS DRINKING
IN THERE,

14:45.009 --> 14:47.928
AND I TOOK
MY MEDICATION.

14:48.012 --> 14:50.973
AND THAT WAS
A BAD COMBINATION.

14:51.056 --> 14:53.225
JUST SET MY HEAD
SWIMMING.

14:55.144 --> 14:57.646
I WAS IN A CONFUSION
WHEN THEY PULLED
THAT HOLDUP.

14:57.730 --> 14:59.899
THEY WAS THREATENING
TO SHOOT PEOPLE,

14:59.982 --> 15:02.610
AND I THOUGHT SOMEBODY
OUGHTA PUT A STOP TO IT.

15:02.693 --> 15:03.986
IS THAT WHAT YOU
WERE TRYING TO DO?

15:04.069 --> 15:06.989
I WAS GONNA
POP ONE OF THEM.

15:07.072 --> 15:08.407
OH, MAN...

15:10.993 --> 15:12.453
YOU WERE THINKING
CLEAR ENOUGH

15:12.536 --> 15:13.829
TO LEAVE THE BAR
AFTER YOU DID IT.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.331
THERE WAS A COMMOTION.

15:15.414 --> 15:16.832
NOBODY EVEN STOPPED ME,

15:16.916 --> 15:18.834
SO I WASN'T EVEN SURE
IF I'D DONE IT OR NOT.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.836
THIS IS GOING
TO BALLISTICS.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.504
YOU GOTTA COME IN.

15:22.588 --> 15:27.176
IF I WENT AND KILLED
A CUSTOMER HAVING A DRINK,

15:27.259 --> 15:29.219
I DON'T KNOW HOW
I'M GONNA LIVE WITH THAT.

15:29.303 --> 15:30.763
LOOK, WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO TAKE YOU IN
TO THE STATION HOUSE

15:30.846 --> 15:32.514
SO WE CAN SORT
THIS WHOLE THING OUT.

15:32.598 --> 15:36.060
I DON'T WANNA DIE
IN THE LOCKUP.

15:36.143 --> 15:37.311
NOW DON'T GO
THINKING LIKE THAT.

15:37.394 --> 15:38.312
COME ON, LET'S GO.

15:38.395 --> 15:39.480
COME ON.

15:39.563 --> 15:41.482
TAKE WHAT YOU NEED
WITH YOU.

15:44.401 --> 15:45.319
[SIGHS]

15:45.402 --> 15:46.487
WHAT'S WRONG?

15:46.570 --> 15:49.448
I KILLED AN INNOCENT MAN,
DIDN'T I?

15:50.783 --> 15:52.201
WHAT ABOUT
YOUR MEDICATION?

15:52.284 --> 15:53.786
YOU NEED
TO TAKE THAT?

16:11.512 --> 16:13.514
YOU WANT A DRINK
OF SOME KIND?

16:13.597 --> 16:14.723
NO.

16:14.807 --> 16:17.101
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO NOW,

16:17.184 --> 16:18.185
WRITE UP MY CONFESSION?

16:18.268 --> 16:19.979
COLLECT YOURSELF
A LITTLE THERE.

16:20.062 --> 16:22.106
WE'LL COME TAKE
YOUR STATEMENT.

16:22.189 --> 16:24.817
KEEP AN EYE
ON HIM.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.782
YOU KNOW
A GOOD TRAIT IN ME?

16:31.865 --> 16:34.702
GUY COULD HAVE A HATCHET
SPLITTING HIS FOREHEAD,

16:34.785 --> 16:36.495
MORTAL ILLNESS
LIKE THIS GUY,

16:36.578 --> 16:38.914
I'LL LAND HARD ON THEM
FOR THEIR DRINKING.

16:38.998 --> 16:40.374
HIM BEING SO SICK,

16:40.457 --> 16:42.751
MAYBE THEY'LL
DECLINE PROSECUTION.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.628
YOU WOULDN'T WANNA
MAKE BOOK ON THAT?

16:44.712 --> 16:45.421
DETECTIVE.

16:45.504 --> 16:47.006
HEY, WHAT'S UP, GINA?

16:47.089 --> 16:49.633
BELLEVUE REPORTED
THEY HAD A BLACK MALE
COME INTO EMERGENCY

16:49.717 --> 16:51.719
WITH A BULLET WOUND.

16:51.802 --> 16:52.970
GINA?

16:53.053 --> 16:57.933
YOU GOT ANY GOOD NEWS
YOU MIGHT WANNA CONFESS?

16:58.017 --> 16:59.101
YOU MIGHT WANNA
TALK TO JAMES.

16:59.184 --> 17:01.103
'CAUSE YOU WERE
THE SUBJECT

17:01.186 --> 17:04.231
OF A LOT OF SMILES
AND SIGNIFYING BEFORE.

17:04.314 --> 17:06.108
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
TALK TO HIM.

17:08.110 --> 17:09.111
WHAT THIS WAS--

17:09.194 --> 17:11.280
MARTINEZ IS DOING
THE RIGHT THING.

17:11.363 --> 17:13.657
LOOK, PURCELL'S NOT
GOING ANYWHERE.

17:13.741 --> 17:15.617
WE SHOULD GO
CHECK THIS GUY
AT BELLEVUE OUT.

17:15.701 --> 17:17.745
"BLACK MALE WITH
A GUNSHOT WOUND."

17:17.828 --> 17:20.122
HERE'S A ONCE-
IN-A-LIFETIME EVENT.

17:25.794 --> 17:27.796
WE WENT TO WORK ON HIM
AS SOON AS HE SHOWED UP.

17:27.880 --> 17:28.964
HE WAS LOSING
CONSIDERABLE BLOOD.

17:29.048 --> 17:30.299
WE GOT MOST
OF THE BULLET OUT.

17:30.382 --> 17:31.425
HE'S STILL GOT
A FRAGMENT INSIDE.

17:31.508 --> 17:32.551
DID ANYBODY
COME IN WITH HIM?

17:32.634 --> 17:34.219
NO. HE WALKED IN
BY HIMSELF.

17:38.515 --> 17:41.977
HOW YOU FEELING,
MR. WELLS?

17:42.061 --> 17:43.896
OH...ABOUT AS, YOU KNOW,

17:43.979 --> 17:46.940
ABOUT AS GOOD AS YOU
CAN EXPECT, CONSIDERING.

17:47.024 --> 17:47.983
MUCH PAIN?

17:48.067 --> 17:49.902
NOTHING I CAN'T HANDLE.

17:49.985 --> 17:51.695
I WOULDN'T WANT
NO MORE, THOUGH.

17:51.779 --> 17:54.406
THESE GENTLEMEN ARE FROM
THE POLICE DEPARTMENT.

17:54.490 --> 17:55.783
DETECTIVE SIMONE
AND, UH...

17:55.866 --> 17:56.825
SIPOWICZ.

17:56.909 --> 17:58.952
HOW'D YOU COME
TO GET SHOT, LEVON?

17:59.036 --> 18:00.996
THAT'S WHAT
I BEEN WONDERING.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.081
DON'T MAKE NO SENSE.

18:02.164 --> 18:04.833
I MEAN, I'M WALKING
DOWN THE STREET

18:04.917 --> 18:07.086
LOOKING TO GET ME
SOME ORANGE JUICE,

18:07.169 --> 18:10.172
AND THIS CAR COME AROUND
AND BOOM--I'M HIT.

18:10.255 --> 18:11.882
YOU SEE WHO DID IT?

18:11.965 --> 18:13.967
GUY HANGING OUT
A WINDOW.

18:14.051 --> 18:15.677
YOU GOT ANY IDEA WHY
HE WAS SHOOTING AT YOU?

18:15.761 --> 18:17.346
JUST 'CAUSE
I WAS THERE, I GUESS.

18:17.429 --> 18:19.348
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
DRIVE-BY THING.

18:19.431 --> 18:21.100
IT LOOKED LIKE, UM...

18:21.183 --> 18:23.977
LIKE A PUERTO RICAN
DUDE.

18:24.061 --> 18:26.814
HIM AND THE DRIVER BOTH.

18:26.897 --> 18:28.524
ANY WITNESSES
SEE THIS HAPPEN?

18:28.607 --> 18:30.234
NAH. IT WASN'T
NOBODY AROUND.

18:30.317 --> 18:34.029
IT WAS DOWN THERE
BELOW HOUSTON STREET.

18:34.113 --> 18:35.989
HOW'D YOU GET YOURSELF
TO THE HOSPITAL?

18:36.073 --> 18:37.574
I HAILED ME A CAB.

18:37.658 --> 18:38.992
MM-HMM.

18:39.076 --> 18:40.869
NOBODY'S AROUND, BUT A CAB
JUST HAPPENED TO COME BY.

18:40.953 --> 18:44.331
YOU EVER BEEN IN TROUBLE
WITH THE LAW, LEVON?

18:44.414 --> 18:47.751
UM, NOTHING TO SPEAK OF.

18:47.835 --> 18:50.379
I MEAN, SHORT OF
A SPEEDING TICKET

18:50.462 --> 18:51.713
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

18:51.797 --> 18:52.923
THIS GUY THAT SHOT YOU,
WHAT'D HE LOOK LIKE?

18:53.006 --> 18:54.049
DESCRIBE HIM.

18:54.133 --> 18:55.759
HE WAS...

18:55.843 --> 18:58.804
A YOUNG...
PUERTO RICAN GUY.

19:00.514 --> 19:05.018
IF YOU SAW HIM AGAIN,
YOU THINK YOU'D
RECOGNIZE HIM?

19:05.102 --> 19:07.146
I GUESS. I WASN'T...

19:07.229 --> 19:09.815
I DIDN'T REALLY TRY
AND STUDY HIM.

19:09.898 --> 19:11.441
YOU KNOW, I WAS...

19:11.525 --> 19:14.695
REALLY WONDERING ABOUT
WHAT THE HELL HAD JUST
HAPPENED TO ME.

19:14.778 --> 19:16.321
I DIDN'T KNOW, MAYBE
I WAS GONNA DIE.

19:17.322 --> 19:18.615
BUT THE DOC, YOU KNOW,

19:18.699 --> 19:20.450
HE DID A GREAT JOB.

19:20.534 --> 19:22.828
HOW ABOUT SHOWING ME
WHERE THE PHONE IS?

19:24.037 --> 19:26.456
SURE. UH, THERE'S ONE
RIGHT DOWN THE HALL.

19:26.540 --> 19:28.375
TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF, LEVON.

19:28.458 --> 19:29.585
RIGHT.
THANK YOU.

19:34.256 --> 19:35.382
DOC.

19:37.509 --> 19:39.720
SAY YOU WAITED
A FEW HOURS

19:39.803 --> 19:40.971
BEFORE YOU TOOK THE REST
OF THAT BULLET OUT.

19:41.054 --> 19:42.723
COULD HE WALK
OUT OF HERE?

19:42.806 --> 19:44.057
HE COULD.

19:44.141 --> 19:46.059
I'M NOT SURE HOW RESPONSIBLE
IT WOULD BE TO LET HIM.

19:46.143 --> 19:48.353
THERE WAS A HOMICIDE
IN A BAR THIS MORNING.

19:48.437 --> 19:51.023
THIS GUY FITS
THE DESCRIPTION.

19:51.106 --> 19:52.399
WE GOT THE WITNESSES.

19:52.482 --> 19:54.443
ALL WE NEED IS TIME
TO PUT HIM IN A LINEUP.

19:54.526 --> 19:55.694
THEN YOU COULD
HAVE HIM BACK HERE,

19:55.777 --> 19:57.112
YOU CAN DO ALL
THE SURGERY YOU WANT.

19:57.196 --> 19:58.405
YOU GOT THE AUTHORITY?

19:58.488 --> 20:00.032
AS LONG AS
IN MY JUDGMENT,

20:00.115 --> 20:01.783
I'M NOT ENDANGERING
THE PATIENT.

20:01.867 --> 20:03.702
SO, WHAT DOES
YOUR JUDGMENT
TELL YOU, DOC?

20:06.872 --> 20:08.290
IF HE STARTS BLEEDING,

20:08.373 --> 20:09.625
YOU HAVE TO BRING HIM
RIGHT IN.

20:09.708 --> 20:11.126
DEFINITELY.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.629
ALL RIGHT. GO AHEAD
AND TAKE HIM.

20:13.712 --> 20:16.548
I LIKE THIS GUY'S ETHICS.

20:27.809 --> 20:29.061
[YAWNING]

20:31.104 --> 20:33.523
OH. I'D BETTER
GET SOME COFFEE.

20:33.607 --> 20:35.734
GET ME ONE,
TOO, HUH?

20:35.817 --> 20:36.902
BLACK, HUH?

20:36.985 --> 20:38.820
YEAH.

20:38.904 --> 20:41.031
IT'S A WOMAN
COMING IN.

20:41.114 --> 20:43.575
YEAH. I DON'T
LIKE MINE BLACK.

20:43.659 --> 20:45.619
I USED TO TAKE IT
WITH CREAM AND SUGAR.

20:45.702 --> 20:47.246
SHE'S OUT OF VIEW.

20:47.329 --> 20:49.790
NOW I'M RESTRICTING
MY CALORIES.

20:49.873 --> 20:51.541
I'VE BEEN TAKING IT
WITH LOW-FAT MILK

20:51.625 --> 20:52.876
AND JUST A DASH
OF SUGAR.

20:52.960 --> 20:55.045
COURSE OF THE DAY,
THAT MAKES A BIG
DIFFERENCE.

20:55.128 --> 20:56.255
SHE'S IN THE ELEVATOR.

20:56.338 --> 20:59.007
ABBY, NOW, SHE SAYS
RENOUNCING COFFEE

20:59.091 --> 21:01.009
IS ONE OF THE BIG
ADJUSTMENTS

21:01.093 --> 21:02.594
OF HER ENTIRE PREGNANCY.

21:02.678 --> 21:04.137
HEY, WHO'S THAT GUY?

21:04.221 --> 21:05.639
WHERE'D HE
COME FROM?

21:08.642 --> 21:09.851
THAT'S HIM.

21:09.935 --> 21:11.353
THAT'S HIM.

21:13.939 --> 21:16.608
POSSIBLE SUSPECT
JUST ENTERED
THE ELEVATOR.

21:16.692 --> 21:18.652
THERE'S A GIRL
IN THERE.

21:18.735 --> 21:19.861
THEY'RE GOING UP.

21:19.945 --> 21:20.946
YEAH. WE SEE HIM.

21:22.781 --> 21:23.907
IT'S THE FIFTH FLOOR.

21:27.703 --> 21:28.870
LET'S GO.

21:30.163 --> 21:31.081
HELP!

21:31.164 --> 21:32.082

21:43.760 --> 21:47.097
SHUT UP, OR
I <i>WILL SHOOT YOU.</i>
DON'T SHOOT.

21:47.180 --> 21:49.433
ARE YOU OK?
ARE YOU HURT?

21:49.516 --> 21:50.434
UHH!

22:18.712 --> 22:19.671
[PAINFULLY]

22:20.881 --> 22:22.674
OHH! MAN, I DON'T

22:24.718 --> 22:27.387
YOU'LL BE ABLE

22:36.897 --> 22:39.232
WHY DON'T YOU JUST

22:39.316 --> 22:41.109
I'M NOT STANDIN'
IN NO DAMN LINEUP.

22:41.193 --> 22:42.694

<i>LOOKIN' AT A LINEUP.</i>

22:42.778 --> 22:44.696

22:44.780 --> 22:47.032
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
YOU AIN'T GOT NOTHIN'

22:47.115 --> 22:48.950

22:49.034 --> 22:50.994
THEN JUST SIT THERE.
YOU'RE NOT FEELING GOOD,

22:51.078 --> 22:52.871
AND WE NEED AN EXTRA
GUY. WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

22:52.954 --> 22:54.706
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

22:54.790 --> 22:59.920
WE'RE TRYING TO I.D. A GUY
WHO WAS COPPING A FEEL

23:00.879 --> 23:02.297
OHHH.

23:04.716 --> 23:06.134
THAT'S REAL SICK, MAN.

23:06.218 --> 23:09.137

23:09.221 --> 23:10.639
EVER. I MEAN...AND...

23:10.722 --> 23:12.474
YOU KNOW THAT,
AND I KNOW THAT.

23:12.557 --> 23:14.643
YOU AIN'T

23:16.686 --> 23:18.647

23:20.774 --> 23:22.359
MOVE YOUR LEG OVER,

YOU HEARD ME.

23:25.278 --> 23:28.657
OH. HERE. LET ME
STRAIGHTEN THAT

23:33.787 --> 23:35.539

23:35.622 --> 23:38.875
ALL RIGHT. LIKE I SAID,
THIS IS A ONE-WAY GLASS.
THEY CAN'T SEE YA.

23:38.959 --> 23:40.794
I WANT YOU TO
TAKE A GOOD LOOK
AT EACH ONE OF 'EM.

23:40.877 --> 23:45.006
IF YOU RECOGNIZE ANYBODY,
YOU TELL US WHICH NUMBER AND
WHERE YOU RECOGNIZE HIM FROM.

23:45.090 --> 23:46.341

23:46.425 --> 23:47.759
LET'S DO IT.

23:53.223 --> 23:55.725

HE WAS ONE OF 'EM.

23:55.809 --> 23:58.603
YOU SURE?
YEAH. HE WAS
RIGHT IN MY FACE YELLING
HE WAS GONNA KILL ME.

23:58.687 --> 24:00.105
HE SHOOT
THE CUSTOMER?

24:00.188 --> 24:03.233
NO. IT WAS ONE
OF THE OTHERS
THAT DID IT.

24:03.316 --> 24:06.111
YOU SEE THIS GUY
HERE GET SHOT?
I DIDN'T KNOW
HE GOT SHOT.

24:07.571 --> 24:09.406
MAYBE THEY SHOT HIM
SOMEPLACE ELSE.

24:10.740 --> 24:12.909
ALL RIGHT,
HOLD NUMBER 2.
THE REST CAN GO.

24:12.993 --> 24:14.286

YOU LYIN' BITCH!

24:16.997 --> 24:18.415

24:18.498 --> 24:20.292

24:20.375 --> 24:21.960
YOU NEVER SEEN ME BEFORE,

24:22.043 --> 24:24.045
WHY DON'T YOU COME OUT HERE

24:26.047 --> 24:29.217

24:34.014 --> 24:35.140
Harold: SHUT UP!

24:36.224 --> 24:37.726

24:37.809 --> 24:39.519
I NEVER PUT MY HANDS

24:39.603 --> 24:41.188
THE JUDGE'LL
THROW THIS
OUTTA COURT!

24:41.271 --> 24:43.648
TRYIN' TO RUN SOME
STUPID-ASS FRAME-UP
LIKE THIS.

24:43.732 --> 24:45.025
YOU AIN'T
GOT NOTHIN'.

24:45.108 --> 24:46.318
OH, NOTHIN'.

24:46.401 --> 24:48.528
NO. YOU JUST

24:48.612 --> 24:51.615

ON SECOND AVENUE,

24:51.698 --> 24:53.325
AND WE GOT
7 OTHER WITNESSES

24:53.408 --> 24:55.327
THAT SAW YOU
PULLING THAT STICKUP.

24:55.410 --> 24:59.039
YOU THINK THEY'RE
GONNA FORGET A FACE
LIKE YOU GOT?

24:59.122 --> 25:00.040
SIT DOWN.

25:04.002 --> 25:06.922
I'M WEAK
FROM LOSIN' MY BLOOD,
AND YOU HARASSIN' ME.

25:07.005 --> 25:08.798
I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT NO STICKUP.

25:08.882 --> 25:10.592
YOU'RE LOOKING
AT FIRST DEGREE MURDER.
WE'RE HARASSING <i>YOU.</i>

25:10.675 --> 25:11.968
I NEVER MURDERED
NOBODY!

25:12.052 --> 25:13.887
WELL, WHO KNOWS?
THAT MAY BE TRUE.

25:13.970 --> 25:16.014
IF IT IS, YOU NEED
TO CLEAR THIS WHOLE
THING UP FOR US,

25:16.097 --> 25:20.101
'CAUSE RIGHT NOW
YOU ARE LOOKING
AT THE DEATH PENALTY.

25:20.185 --> 25:22.562
THEY WANNA CROAK
SOMEBODY FOR THIS,
LEVON,

25:22.646 --> 25:24.481
BUT IT DON'T

25:24.564 --> 25:27.275

PULLED THE TRIGGER,
WE'LL GO TO THE D.A.

25:27.359 --> 25:29.736
AND GET
THIS MURDER CHARGE

25:34.699 --> 25:36.618
WILL YOU

ON THE ROBBERY?

25:36.701 --> 25:40.163
WE WILL DO OUR BEST.
D.A. TENDS TO LISTEN
TO US.

25:40.247 --> 25:42.666
SON OF A BITCH...
PUT ME IN A HOSPITAL.

25:42.749 --> 25:44.084
I'M--I'M THE VICTIM.

25:44.167 --> 25:46.628
HOW DID YOU HAPPEN
TO GET SHOT THERE, LEVON?

25:46.711 --> 25:48.380
IN THE BAR.

25:48.463 --> 25:50.674
YOU GOT SHOT
AT THE BAR.
YEAH.

25:50.757 --> 25:52.676
WE WENT IN THERE.
ONE OF THOSE DAMN FOOLS
WAS SO HIGH,

25:52.759 --> 25:54.553
HE DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT HE WAS DOIN'.

25:54.636 --> 25:56.513
WE WAS ALL HIGH
WHEN WE WENT IN THERE.

25:56.596 --> 25:58.890
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.

25:58.974 --> 26:00.809
YOUR PARTNER
IS STUPID ENOUGH
TO SHOOT YOU.

26:00.892 --> 26:03.770
WHY IN THE HELL
ARE YOU GONNA WANT TO
TAKE THE FALL FOR HIM?

26:03.853 --> 26:06.356
'CAUSE THIS IS ALL
COMING DOWN ON <i>YOU.</i>

26:06.439 --> 26:08.525
WHO DID THE SHOOTING
IN THERE, LEVON?

26:08.608 --> 26:10.110
GIVE US A NAME.

26:12.737 --> 26:14.614
THEY KILL YOU
WITH A NEEDLE
FULL OF POISON--

26:14.698 --> 26:16.575
I KNOW HOW

26:21.413 --> 26:23.707
IT'S A DUDE

YEAH, YOU GOTTA

WHAT DO YOU THINK?

26:28.795 --> 26:32.591
WE DON'T COME UP
WITH THESE GUYS, YOU
DON'T GET NO DEAL.

26:33.925 --> 26:35.176
IT'S RICHIE DAY.

26:35.260 --> 26:37.012
WHERE WE GONNA
FIND THESE GUYS?

26:37.095 --> 26:38.972
I DON'T KNOW

26:39.055 --> 26:41.558
DROPPED ME OFF
AT THE HOSPITAL AND
WENT OFF SOMEPLACE.

26:41.641 --> 26:43.560
HOW ABOUT YOUR CUT
OF THE MONEY?

26:43.643 --> 26:46.605
I'M SUPPOSED
TO PICK IT UP
FROM THEM LATER ON.

26:46.688 --> 26:49.441
THEY GOT A BEEPER NUMBER
I WAS GONNA CALL.

26:49.524 --> 26:51.735
YOU TRUST THESE GUYS
ARE GONNA BE
WAITING FOR YOU?

26:53.153 --> 26:54.738
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE I DON'T.

26:54.821 --> 26:56.197
WHAT'S
THE BEEPER NUMBER?

26:56.281 --> 26:58.199
I WANT TO SEE
THIS D.A. FIRST.

26:58.283 --> 26:59.743
YOU'LL SEE THE D.A.
WHEN WE GOT SOMETHING
TO OFFER HIM.

26:59.826 --> 27:01.536
WHAT'S
THE BEEPER NUMBER?

27:07.125 --> 27:08.084
OVER THERE.

27:12.130 --> 27:14.257
CAN I SAY SOMETHING,
PLEASE?

27:14.341 --> 27:15.925
THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE HERE FOR.

27:16.009 --> 27:18.637
I'M JUST SORRY ABOUT
THIS WHOLE THING, OK?

27:18.720 --> 27:21.097
IT WAS MORE JUST
LIKE A MISUNDERSTANDING.

27:21.181 --> 27:22.265
OH.

27:22.349 --> 27:25.226
WELL. THEN THAT OUGHT
TO TAKE CARE OF IT.

27:25.310 --> 27:26.895
LOOK, I LIKED
HER LOOKS, OK?

27:26.978 --> 27:29.105
I--I JUST WANTED
TO TALK TO HER.

27:29.189 --> 27:31.274
I JUST WENT ABOUT IT
THE WRONG WAY.
YEAH.

27:31.358 --> 27:34.944
YEAH, I GUESS ATTEMPTED
RAPE ISN'T THE BEST WAY
TO INTRODUCE YOURSELF.

27:35.028 --> 27:37.364
HOLD IT. YOU THINK
I'M TRYIN' TO RAPE
THAT GIRL, YOU'RE WRONG.

27:37.447 --> 27:39.783
THERE'VE BEEN 3 RAPES
COMMITTED IN THAT HOTEL.

27:39.866 --> 27:43.912
SO WHAT? THAT WASN'T ME.
I NEVER DONE IT, NEVER WILL.
I'M NOT INTERESTED IN THAT.

27:43.995 --> 27:47.457
LOOK, I'M
INTO CONSENSABLE SEX.

27:47.540 --> 27:49.626
EVEN PAY FOR IT
IF I HAVE TO.

27:49.709 --> 27:52.128
IS THIS A KIND OF JOKE
OR SOMETHING?

27:52.212 --> 27:54.130
LOOK, IT WAS A ROBBERY,
PURE AND SIMPLE.

27:54.214 --> 27:56.132
I SAW THIS GIRL
AT THE ATM MACHINE.

27:56.216 --> 27:58.134
SHE TOOK OUT
ABOUT $100 AT LEAST,
SO I FOLLOWED HER.

27:58.218 --> 27:59.928
I WAS GONNA TAKE HER PURSE
RIGHT THEN AND THERE, BOOM,

28:00.011 --> 28:01.429
BUT THERE'S TOO MANY
PEOPLE AROUND.

28:01.513 --> 28:03.014
SO SHE DUCKED
INTO THE HOTEL.

28:03.098 --> 28:04.891
I'M THINKIN' I'LL RIP HER
OFF FROM THERE. THAT'S ALL.
NO, BARRY.

28:04.974 --> 28:09.562
THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED.
YOU WERE GONNA RAPE HER
LIKE YOU DID THE OTHER TWO.

28:09.646 --> 28:11.606
AND YOU'RE GONNA GO AWAY
FOR MOST OF YOUR LIFE

28:11.690 --> 28:14.734
IF YOU DON'T START
THINKING ABOUT COPPING
A PLEA RIGHT NOW.

28:14.818 --> 28:16.277
LOOK, I'M NOTHIN'
BUT A THIEF.

28:16.361 --> 28:18.279
I'M NONVIOLENT.
I COULDN'T
EVEN DO A RAPE.

28:18.363 --> 28:20.156
I'M NOT MADE
LIKE THAT.

28:21.241 --> 28:22.617
I'M A LOVER,
NOT A RAPIST.

28:22.701 --> 28:25.161
YOU'RE A LIAR.
THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE.

28:26.955 --> 28:28.456
ALL RIGHT,
WE GOT BARRY'S SHEET.

28:28.540 --> 28:31.710
ROBBERY, SHOPLIFTING,
PURSE SNATCHING,
PETTY LARCENY OF A DOG.

28:33.002 --> 28:34.587
A DOG?

28:34.671 --> 28:35.880
THIS DOG FOLLOWED ME.

28:35.964 --> 28:38.425
HUH. WITH YOU
PULLING THE LEASH?

28:38.508 --> 28:42.387
I WAS TAKING THE DOG BACK
WHEN I GOT BUSTED.

28:42.470 --> 28:44.639
THE POINT IS, YOU SEE
ANY RAPES ON THERE?

28:44.723 --> 28:45.724
NO.

28:46.725 --> 28:48.309
NO.

28:48.393 --> 28:49.310
HUH?

28:49.394 --> 28:51.187
I'M NOTHIN'
BUT A TWO-BIT THIEF.

28:51.271 --> 28:54.274
CAN'T YOU SEE
THAT YOU GOT
THE WRONG GUY HERE?

28:57.652 --> 29:00.029
I'M GONNA RUN OVER
TO THE HOSPITAL.

29:00.113 --> 29:01.364

AND I GOTTA TELL YA--
THERE'S NOBODY THE JURY

35:13.027 --> 35:14.904
A JUDGE,

PLENTY OF THEM.

35:14.987 --> 35:16.948
THEY SHOW REMORSE
FOR WHAT THEY DID,

35:17.031 --> 35:18.908
HE CAN UNDERSTAND
AS HUMAN BEINGS
THAT THEY'VE

35:18.991 --> 35:20.618
LOST CONTROL
AND MADE A MISTAKE.

35:20.701 --> 35:22.120
A JURY...NO.

35:22.203 --> 35:24.497
THEY'RE GONNA BE
OUT FOR BLOOD.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.669

35:56.654 --> 36:00.116
ASK ME, STANLEY,

36:01.826 --> 36:03.744

36:03.828 --> 36:06.247
BUT LET ME TELL YA,
IT'S IMPORTANT...

36:06.330 --> 36:09.250
IF YOU SHOW REMORSE
AND THEY THINK
YOU WANT TO CHANGE.

36:09.333 --> 36:10.626
BUT YOU GOTTA BE
GENUINE.

36:10.710 --> 36:12.628

36:12.712 --> 36:15.840

MAKE YOURSELF FEEL IT.

36:20.052 --> 36:22.013
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO
IS WRITE IT OUT

36:22.096 --> 36:24.640
AND EXPLAIN TO THE JUDGE
HOW IT HAPPENED.

36:24.724 --> 36:26.309
THEY WERE YOUNG ONCE.

36:26.392 --> 36:29.437
THEY KNOW HOW A GUY
CAN GO AROUND THINKING
ABOUT IT ALL DAY,

36:29.520 --> 36:32.440
STREETS FULL OF GIRLS,
MAYBE GET DRUNK,
GET A LITTLE CRAZY.

36:32.523 --> 36:35.401
YOU LOST CONTROL,
AND YOU'RE SORRY
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.

36:35.484 --> 36:37.320
I REALLY AM SORRY.

36:37.403 --> 36:39.238

37:11.938 --> 37:13.356

GO FOR THE BULLET.

37:40.925 --> 37:43.010
BUT HE'S ALL RIGHT?

37:43.094 --> 37:44.762
BULLET IN THE DEAD GUY

37:51.477 --> 37:52.937

38:41.444 --> 38:44.905
WENT TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM
WITH A GUNSHOT WOUND.

38:44.989 --> 38:49.869

38:55.541 --> 38:56.876
I DIDN'T SEE IT.

38:56.959 --> 38:59.378
I DIDN'T SEE IT.

38:59.462 --> 39:01.881
THE WAY WE FIGURE IT--

39:01.964 --> 39:03.549
[THUD]
UHH...

39:05.009 --> 39:06.927
YOU DIDN'T HEAR
THE OTHER GUN GO OFF

39:07.011 --> 39:11.390
'CAUSE, UH, YOU SHOT
ABOUT SIMULTANEOUS
WITH THE STICKUP GUY,

39:11.474 --> 39:14.393
PLUS YOUR SENSES
BEING DULLED.

39:14.477 --> 39:16.395
I HAD A FEW DRINKS,

39:16.479 --> 39:19.398
AND I REMEMBER
I TOOK MY MEDICATION,

39:19.482 --> 39:21.359
AND I HADN'T HAD
NO BREAKFAST,

39:21.442 --> 39:23.402
SO I SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
CARRYING A GUN LIKE THAT.

39:23.486 --> 39:25.905
TRUTH IS, WITHOUT YOU
SHOOTING THAT SKEL
IN THE SHOULDER,

39:25.988 --> 39:27.948
WE PROBABLY
WOULDN'T HAVE FOUND
NONE OF THEM.

39:28.032 --> 39:30.326
EVEN SO, FROM NOW ON,
YOU SHOULD LEAVE
THAT GUN HOME.

39:30.409 --> 39:31.952
OH, THAT'S...

39:32.036 --> 39:34.997
THAT'S A WEIGHT OFF ME,
KNOWING I DIDN'T
KILL NOBODY.

39:35.081 --> 39:38.376
WELL, WE'RE GLAD ENOUGH
TO BE ABLE TO TELL YOU.

39:39.377 --> 39:40.544
[COUGHS]

39:40.628 --> 39:43.381
YOU THINK THEY GONNA
NEED ME IN COURT LATER ON?

39:43.464 --> 39:45.424
WE'LL KEEP YOU POSTED
ON THAT.

39:45.508 --> 39:48.260
WHY DON'T YOU GO HOME NOW
AND GET SOME REST?

39:50.971 --> 39:54.392
YOU KNOW...I WOULD LIKE
TO WRITE UP A STATEMENT,

39:54.475 --> 39:56.852
THOUGH I DON'T KNOW
HOW MUCH LONGER
I'M GONNA BE HERE.

39:56.936 --> 39:57.853
YOU KNOW,
I'M KNOCKING OFF.

39:57.937 --> 40:00.022
WHY DON'T I
GIVE YOU A RIDE?

40:00.106 --> 40:02.817
YEAH. WE'RE BOTH
KNOCKING OFF.

40:02.900 --> 40:06.445
COME ON.
WE'LL GIVE YOU
A RIDE HOME.

40:32.012 --> 40:34.390
OHH...
HA HA HA!

40:34.473 --> 40:37.393
I THINK THIS <i>IS</i>
THE HONEYMOON SUITE.

40:37.476 --> 40:39.812
NO. I SEEN PICTURES.
THIS ISN'T IT.

40:39.895 --> 40:41.939
WELL,
IT'S <i>A HONEYMOON SUITE.</i>

40:42.022 --> 40:43.899
AH...

40:43.983 --> 40:46.902
THE ONE TIME I THOUGHT
MY UNCLE BEING
A DEGENERATE GAMBLER

40:46.986 --> 40:49.280
WOULD ACTUALLY
WORK OUT A PLUS.

40:49.363 --> 40:51.699
THE SUITE'S FINE,
JAMES.

40:51.782 --> 40:53.075
YEAH.

40:53.159 --> 40:55.411
NO REASON
WE SHOULD ALLOW
ROOM DISAPPOINTMENT

40:55.494 --> 40:57.913
TO OVERSHADOW
THE OCCASION.

40:57.997 --> 41:00.499
I'M GLAD WE DID IT
LIKE THIS.

41:00.583 --> 41:01.959
NO SAYING
IF YOU DECIDE LATER

41:02.042 --> 41:04.920
WE CAN'T HAVE
A SECOND CEREMONY
FOR THE FAMILIES.

41:05.004 --> 41:06.922
IT'S OUR MARRIAGE.
IT'S OUR BABY.

41:07.006 --> 41:08.299
IT'S OUR LIFE TOGETHER.

41:08.382 --> 41:10.468
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN.

41:17.516 --> 41:18.934
HUSBAND AND WIFE NOW.

41:19.018 --> 41:20.895
I CAN UNDRESS
IN FRONT OF YOU.

41:20.978 --> 41:24.607
WHOA. IF I HAD KNOWN THAT,
I WOULD'VE REALLY INSISTED.

41:34.700 --> 41:36.285
YOUR SWEET BELLY.

41:36.368 --> 41:38.329
SAY "I LOVE YOU"
TO YOUR CHILD.

41:50.466 --> 41:52.885
I LOVE YOU.

41:52.968 --> 41:54.929
AND I LOVE YOUR MOTHER.

42:49.942 --> 42:53.862
THAT WAS NICE,
SET THEM COMPARTMENTS UP
FOR HIS MEDICATIONS.

42:53.946 --> 42:58.367
LEFT FIELD HOW HE IS,
HE'LL PROBABLY USE 'EM
FOR DINNER UTENSILS.

42:58.450 --> 42:59.451
YEAH.

43:01.453 --> 43:02.788
ANYWAYS, UH...

43:04.456 --> 43:07.376
GOOD TO BE BACK
WORKING WITH YOU.

43:07.459 --> 43:08.961
SAME HERE, BOBBY.

43:11.964 --> 43:12.965
GOOD NIGHT, PARTNER.

43:16.552 --> 43:17.511
SEE YOU TOMORROW.

43:17.595 --> 43:20.347
YOU TAKE CARE.
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.
