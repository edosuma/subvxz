WEBVTT

01:40.938 --> 01:42.356
All right, mama.

01:43.148 --> 01:44.400
You look well.

01:44.400 --> 01:45.526
- Okay.
I do?

01:45.526 --> 01:47.278
Yes, you do. You look nice.

01:47.278 --> 01:49.446
It's a lot.
It is a lot.

02:00.040 --> 02:01.250
Okay.

02:01.250 --> 02:02.584
You like isolation, huh?

02:06.213 --> 02:09.049
You want a special invitation?
Get your ass in the line. Let's go!

02:09.049 --> 02:10.801
Fuck off! Don't come over here.

02:34.783 --> 02:36.535
Ain't no damn way
you coming back up in here.

02:36.535 --> 02:37.911
- Why not?
- Back up.

02:40.748 --> 02:43.083
I was wondering
why the hell you disappeared.

02:43.751 --> 02:46.754
RAP sheet as long
as a goddamned sidewalk.

02:46.754 --> 02:48.756
I'ma call the cops,
you keep standing there.

02:48.756 --> 02:50.883
All right, well,
then give me my two weeks back.

02:50.883 --> 02:53.802
- From a year and a half ago?
- Then give me my job back.

02:54.428 --> 02:55.930
You know what?

02:57.431 --> 02:58.766
Here. Here-- Here you go.

02:59.767 --> 03:01.018
That good enough for you?

03:05.439 --> 03:07.900
Is that Inez?

03:08.525 --> 03:11.946
- Oh, my God!
- How you doing, mama?

03:13.072 --> 03:14.531
I thought you moved
to another shelter.

03:14.531 --> 03:16.033
No, you know I was in Rikers.

03:16.033 --> 03:18.160
They had me in there
for boosting and shit.

03:18.160 --> 03:19.912
Can't wait for you
to get at this hair, though.

03:19.912 --> 03:22.331
If I go get the dye,
will you please do it for me next week?

03:22.331 --> 03:23.999
I really missed you, girl.

03:23.999 --> 03:25.376
Yeah, and apparently these roots too.

03:25.376 --> 03:26.585
- What you been doing?

03:26.585 --> 03:28.045
- What she been doing?
Nothing.

03:28.045 --> 03:29.338
Yes, the roots missed you too.

03:29.338 --> 03:30.422
Terry, hurry up!

03:30.422 --> 03:31.507
Hey-hey-hey-hey...

03:31.507 --> 03:34.051
You ain't getting nothing from
the store if you keep acting like that!

03:34.051 --> 03:36.428
Inez, whatever happened
to that scammer you was fucking with?

03:36.428 --> 03:38.013
You ever hear from him?

03:38.013 --> 03:39.348
We missed you, yo.

03:42.309 --> 03:43.477
Terry.

03:46.146 --> 03:47.648
You don't hear me calling you?

03:49.984 --> 03:51.777
You don't remember me now?

03:53.237 --> 03:56.240
Just let me see your eyes, T,
so I know you're not mad at me.

03:57.199 --> 03:58.742
He not gonna answer.

03:58.742 --> 04:00.828
I'm back across the street
at the shelter.

04:00.828 --> 04:03.163
And, look,
I'm staying out of trouble this time.

04:03.163 --> 04:06.041
I'ma be around here for good now.
You hear that, T?

04:07.835 --> 04:09.837
Just want to make sure you're doing okay.

04:12.256 --> 04:15.175
Here. Get you another Icee.

04:15.175 --> 04:17.302
Look, y'all keep this between us, aight?

04:17.970 --> 04:19.804
Don't let nobody know I came by here.

04:19.804 --> 04:20.931
Okay.

04:22.308 --> 04:24.560
You're pretty.
See y'all around.

04:25.519 --> 04:27.479
Man, stop flirting with people.

04:42.119 --> 04:44.580
Hey! Hey-hey-hey! None of that!

04:44.580 --> 04:47.249
Get up. Get up. Okay, let's go!

04:47.249 --> 04:51.211
Everybody, if you don't know how to act,
then we not coming to the park!

04:51.837 --> 04:53.464
Turn around. Let's go!

05:02.890 --> 05:05.809
I got the perms, the hairs, the weaves!

05:05.809 --> 05:08.312
Fuck off the street!
- Wash and dry.

05:08.312 --> 05:11.482
- I know you want that hair done.
Next time, I'ma hit you!

05:11.482 --> 05:12.650
Hey-hey-hey, ma-ma-ma-ma!

05:12.650 --> 05:13.984
- Excuse me, excuse me.

05:13.984 --> 05:15.361
Hold on. Slow down.

05:15.361 --> 05:17.196
Hey, you know you want me
to do your hair.

05:17.196 --> 05:19.990
Bitch, move!
What the fuck is wrong with you?

05:21.450 --> 05:22.701
Thank you, baby.

05:23.744 --> 05:24.954
Hey, come here.

05:25.579 --> 05:26.580
How are you?

05:26.580 --> 05:29.458
I want to take this French roll out
and put me some length in.

05:29.458 --> 05:31.543
Yeah, you know, I do braids for 75.

05:31.543 --> 05:32.670
- Call me.
- All right.

05:32.670 --> 05:34.296
My number's right there, right there.

05:35.130 --> 05:36.173
Aight.

05:36.173 --> 05:38.259
I'm about to ask y'all
a serious question.

05:38.259 --> 05:40.511
Who is y'all best player of all time?

05:40.511 --> 05:42.513
Bro, what?

05:43.555 --> 05:45.683
- Michael Jordan!

05:46.725 --> 05:47.935
Shawn.
- Huh? Oh. Oh, hi.

05:47.935 --> 05:49.687
How's your friend doing?
I need to know he's okay.

05:49.687 --> 05:51.480
Terry not here no more.
Stop asking!

05:51.480 --> 05:52.940
Well, figure out a better answer.

05:53.816 --> 05:56.568
Now, if I tell you, what you gonna gimme?

05:59.029 --> 06:00.698
- Here.
- Thank you.

06:00.698 --> 06:01.782
Now what's up?

06:02.408 --> 06:03.450
He at the hospital.

06:03.951 --> 06:06.078
The hospital? Why?
What happened?

06:06.078 --> 06:07.663
Running from our foster mother.

06:07.663 --> 06:10.416
Fell out the window, hit his head.

06:19.174 --> 06:20.175
Let me see.

06:24.430 --> 06:25.472
It hurt?

06:27.391 --> 06:29.810
You know, you could've died
doing something like that?

06:37.818 --> 06:39.653
What's wrong with the one I gave you?

06:39.653 --> 06:40.946
It's corny.

06:41.780 --> 06:44.199
All right, well,
then buy your own fucking toy, then.

06:51.790 --> 06:52.875
What you like?

06:54.793 --> 06:56.503
Power Rangers.

07:01.300 --> 07:03.010
Tell me more
about your foster mother.

07:03.010 --> 07:04.136
You like her?

07:09.642 --> 07:11.644
She probably gone anyway.

07:12.478 --> 07:15.689
When I was in foster care,
stuff like this happened all the time.

07:17.942 --> 07:19.860
My sister used to look out for me.

07:20.653 --> 07:22.279
But she ran away.

07:22.279 --> 07:23.864
Where's she at now?

07:25.115 --> 07:26.200
I don't know.

07:28.118 --> 07:29.495
I can't find her.

07:31.121 --> 07:33.040
My family's gone, boo.

07:43.384 --> 07:46.178
You left me on the street corner?

07:51.684 --> 07:53.560
Who would tell you something like that?

07:55.020 --> 07:57.231
Why the fuck would they tell you
some shit like that?

08:02.736 --> 08:04.071
Get that out your head.

08:16.959 --> 08:18.836
Hey, yo, what's up, ma?
What you doing?

08:18.836 --> 08:21.422
Pushing my way. Where you going?
What's happenin'?

08:21.422 --> 08:25.301
Yo, he got his feelings hurt.
He got his feelings hurt.

09:05.132 --> 09:06.300
Wow, really?

09:07.635 --> 09:09.345
Hold up. Hold up, hold up, hold up.

09:10.679 --> 09:11.722
Want to split this?

09:11.722 --> 09:12.806
Yeah.

09:14.350 --> 09:15.559
Okay.

09:28.989 --> 09:30.407
Um,

09:30.407 --> 09:31.492
T...

09:33.369 --> 09:36.413
I just wanted to come say bye.

09:36.413 --> 09:38.040
Just for a little while.

09:38.040 --> 09:39.583
Um...

09:39.583 --> 09:41.043
I think they gonna move you.

09:42.836 --> 09:46.173
I don't know where yet,

09:46.840 --> 09:48.175
but I'll see you soon.

09:58.352 --> 10:00.187
Save my beeper number,

10:01.605 --> 10:03.065
just in case,

10:04.692 --> 10:06.318
till I find you, okay?

10:10.406 --> 10:11.490
When?

10:15.035 --> 10:16.203
I don't know yet.

10:21.417 --> 10:23.627
Why you keep leaving me?

10:38.851 --> 10:42.563
Well, that means you have bad luck,

10:42.563 --> 10:47.651
because I'm about to do a karate kick!

10:48.652 --> 10:50.404
Pow! Pow!

11:25.022 --> 11:27.733
Would it make you feel better
if you came to stay with me?

11:29.401 --> 11:31.278
Just for a couple days?

11:31.904 --> 11:33.364
Yeah.

turn into the suburbs?

12:19.451 --> 12:21.328
- How's the pizza?
- Good.

12:29.336 --> 12:30.671
Where's my dad at?

12:34.633 --> 12:36.051
He's gone.

12:38.178 --> 12:41.181
You wouldn't have liked him anyway.
I got somebody else in mind.

12:47.438 --> 12:48.689
You miss your old friends?

12:48.689 --> 12:50.441
They're not my friends.

12:51.275 --> 12:54.570
Yeah. Sometimes
I feel like I ain't got no friends either.

12:57.865 --> 12:58.866
Except you.

13:04.204 --> 13:05.205
Ugh.

13:27.937 --> 13:29.563
How much longer?

13:32.149 --> 13:35.194
- How much longer?

13:35.194 --> 13:36.946
<i>We're sorry.</i>

13:36.946 --> 13:39.490
- How much--
- Terry, just gimme a minute, please.

13:39.490 --> 13:40.866
We gonna sleep out here?

13:40.866 --> 13:42.159
- You want to?
- No.

13:42.159 --> 13:44.620
All right, then shut the fuck up
and let me finish!

13:44.620 --> 13:46.038
<i>...and try your call again.</i>

13:47.706 --> 13:50.084
- Sorry for cursing.

13:50.084 --> 13:52.670
Damn, Terry! Just go, go.
Go back to Brooklyn.

13:52.670 --> 13:54.838
- Go back to Brooklyn!
- I don't want to go back!

13:54.838 --> 13:58.008
- I'll call your social workers right now!
- I want to stay with you!

13:58.008 --> 13:59.635
Well, then stop crying
and look at me.

13:59.635 --> 14:02.429
All you got is me. Okay?

14:03.931 --> 14:05.891
I'll go to war for you, you know that?

14:05.891 --> 14:08.560
Do you understand that?
Against anybody.

14:08.560 --> 14:11.188
Against this whole fucked-up city.

14:11.188 --> 14:12.564
They can try all they want.

14:12.564 --> 14:15.985
They can try all they want,
but they not breaking us up this time.

14:17.069 --> 14:18.612
You want to find a new home?

14:19.363 --> 14:20.364
Hmm?

14:20.364 --> 14:22.157
Yes.

14:22.157 --> 14:24.451
But I need to know
we in this thing together.

14:25.286 --> 14:26.495
Tell me.

14:26.495 --> 14:29.540
- We're in this together.
- Tell me!

14:29.540 --> 14:31.333
We're in this together!

14:55.232 --> 14:56.275
<i>Hello?</i>

14:56.275 --> 14:58.277
Kim? Boo, it's Inez.

14:58.277 --> 15:00.529
Oh, my God,
thank God you got the same number.

15:00.529 --> 15:01.989
Listen, I'm uptown.

15:10.623 --> 15:13.584
Y'all go sit in the living room
while I talk to her real quick.

15:13.584 --> 15:15.502
- Is that Ghetto Inez in my living room?
- Shh!

15:15.502 --> 15:17.004
When did you start hanging
with her again?

15:17.004 --> 15:19.465
She's with her son.
Please don't say anything.

15:20.841 --> 15:22.885
She needs a place to stay.

15:24.511 --> 15:26.263
Want to come say hi?

15:26.263 --> 15:28.849
Girl, I'm tired.

15:31.268 --> 15:32.478
For how long?

15:33.354 --> 15:34.813
I don't know.

15:34.813 --> 15:36.857
We'll deal with this tomorrow.

15:39.443 --> 15:41.362
Good morning, sunshine.

15:43.155 --> 15:45.616
If y'all are hungry,
I'ma make breakfast downstairs.

15:45.616 --> 15:47.201
Come on, dance with me.

15:49.870 --> 15:51.956
Oh.

15:51.956 --> 15:54.875
Look at you. Look at you.

15:57.795 --> 15:59.672
You get your GED?

15:59.672 --> 16:02.424
- Inside.
- Really?

16:02.424 --> 16:04.760
Yo, that's fly.

16:04.760 --> 16:07.888
Bruh, you get, like, excited
about the weirdest things.

16:07.888 --> 16:10.099
- I'm proud of you!

16:10.808 --> 16:11.809
So what's your plan?

16:12.393 --> 16:14.853
You up here for good or...

16:15.396 --> 16:18.565
I don't know.
I'm tired of these catty-ass shops.

16:19.858 --> 16:22.486
- Start your own.
- With what money?

16:22.486 --> 16:24.822
What am I supposed to do right now?

16:24.822 --> 16:27.241
Me and my son
need something to eat right now.

16:28.951 --> 16:30.369
Yeah.

16:30.369 --> 16:34.331
You know, I've been meaning
to ask you about Terry.

16:36.083 --> 16:40.004
So, you have him with, uh, Lucky?

16:43.632 --> 16:46.010
Me and Lucky were broken up
when I had T.

16:46.010 --> 16:47.428
He still locked up?

16:48.262 --> 16:49.471
Yeah.

16:49.471 --> 16:51.098
I'll introduce them when he gets out.

17:00.441 --> 17:01.609
The city had him.

17:01.609 --> 17:03.777
He's not supposed
to be with me.

17:05.029 --> 17:07.239
Yo, can't you get locked up
for some shit like that?

17:07.239 --> 17:09.157
Not if you keep it to yourself.

17:15.455 --> 17:16.749
Um...

17:20.961 --> 17:22.253
It's safe with me.

17:31.931 --> 17:33.515
Nez, we good.

17:35.309 --> 17:38.354
Look at the cute little dinosaurs.

17:39.772 --> 17:41.732
- They look dumb.
- Okay, no, they don't.

17:41.732 --> 17:43.484
Stop being mean.

17:45.235 --> 17:46.695
She working?

17:46.695 --> 17:48.989
I think she went job hunting today.

17:49.865 --> 17:52.618
You can't go to anybody's place
looking and talking like that.

17:52.618 --> 17:54.078
And all that yakking.

17:54.078 --> 17:55.996
Ma, she can borrow my stuff.

17:57.456 --> 17:59.625
Terry, you like the coloring books, baby?

18:00.834 --> 18:04.380
Good. You know, when I was your age,
my mother taught me how to read.

18:04.380 --> 18:06.006
She spent a lot of time with me.

18:06.006 --> 18:08.592
Well, let me get a loosie, a Big Burst

18:08.592 --> 18:11.011
and some sunflower seeds,
the nacho cheese ones.

18:12.179 --> 18:14.390
<i>...a six-year-old boy snatched.</i>

18:14.390 --> 18:16.392
<i>Brookdale, one of the city's most troubled</i>

18:16.392 --> 18:19.603
<i>and underfunded hospitals,
reports the child was spending</i>

18:19.603 --> 18:21.647
<i>one of his last mornings in patient care.</i>

18:21.647 --> 18:24.483
Um, they talking about that kid
that got snatched in Brooklyn?

18:25.484 --> 18:27.278
I don't know that story.

18:27.278 --> 18:29.488
All right, matter of fact,
let me get a newspaper too.

18:29.488 --> 18:32.283
<i>...information
to please call Crime Stoppers</i>

18:32.283 --> 18:35.995
<i>at 800-577-1212.</i>

18:49.592 --> 18:50.926
<i>Jones residence.</i>
- Yeah, Kim.

18:50.926 --> 18:53.053
I need you to make sure
you keep Terry in your sight.

18:53.053 --> 18:55.097
-<i>Don't let him out of your sight.</i>
- What?

18:55.889 --> 18:57.766
Just keep him in the house.

18:57.766 --> 19:01.145
- Inez, where are you?
-<i>Just do it! Please, Kim!</i>

19:01.145 --> 19:02.980
<i>I don't want nobody asking questions.</i>

19:02.980 --> 19:05.691
-<i>I got to handle some things.</i>
- Of course.

19:10.404 --> 19:12.072
- She say where she was at?
- Uh-uh.

19:12.072 --> 19:14.950
Doesn't make sense. It doesn't
take this long to look for work.

19:14.950 --> 19:17.411
You like to play games, Terry?
- This is ridiculous.

19:19.580 --> 19:21.248
So quiet.

19:24.293 --> 19:25.836
Who's hiding in there?

19:29.423 --> 19:30.591
Mmm?

19:35.262 --> 19:36.764
I found work.

19:43.729 --> 19:45.856
Come on, boo,
so you can try these on.

19:48.859 --> 19:49.944
You like 'em?

19:51.654 --> 19:53.238
They're too big.

19:53.989 --> 19:55.282
You'll grow into them.

19:57.201 --> 19:58.786
Why don't you take 'em upstairs?

20:04.166 --> 20:06.752
Kim, check the stove for me, please.

20:07.294 --> 20:08.629
Okay.

20:09.296 --> 20:11.215
<i>♪ Pray for you, darlin' ♪</i>

20:11.215 --> 20:15.511
<i>♪ Till you decide to come home... ♪</i>

20:15.511 --> 20:17.930
Can you just at least
act like you see me here?

20:19.014 --> 20:22.268
Exactly what do you expect
and want from me?

20:23.018 --> 20:24.937
Strolling in here
after being God-knows-where...

20:24.937 --> 20:26.146
Doing what I had to.

20:26.146 --> 20:28.148
Like some kind of streetwalker.

20:28.941 --> 20:30.609
What the fuck did you just call me?

20:30.609 --> 20:32.278
Shit.

20:32.278 --> 20:33.696
Run that back again.

20:33.696 --> 20:35.114
Ma, Inez...

20:35.114 --> 20:38.325
You always treated me like I'm not
good enough to be around your daughter.

20:39.451 --> 20:41.870
Whatever you think of me,
just spit it out!

20:41.870 --> 20:43.956
I don't think anything of you.

20:46.500 --> 20:48.085
- Inez, what's up with you?
- What!

20:48.085 --> 20:50.337
- What!
- No! I'm fine.

20:50.879 --> 20:52.840
- Glass almost cut my foot.

20:52.840 --> 20:55.676
Turning my house
into damn 125th Street.

20:56.635 --> 20:58.512
- Ma!
- No, no.

21:02.016 --> 21:04.476
The hell are you teaching
that little boy up there?

21:06.687 --> 21:09.773
Twenty-two years old,
acting like a child.

21:09.773 --> 21:13.027
You want them to take you serious,
be from Harlem, not of Harlem.

21:16.196 --> 21:17.531
So that's it?

21:18.198 --> 21:20.284
You don't have nothing else to say?

21:23.704 --> 21:25.205
- I said I was...
- To me!

21:28.709 --> 21:30.753
Was I wrong? Yes.

21:30.753 --> 21:34.465
But what else do you want me to say?
That I'm nothing? A streetwalker?

21:34.465 --> 21:37.676
You can't keep fighting
everyone you disagree with.

21:38.177 --> 21:40.304
We got to grow up.

21:40.304 --> 21:42.973
Okay, look, my mom's gonna be
who she's gonna be, but, like...

21:42.973 --> 21:44.516
But, like, what?

21:46.060 --> 21:49.563
When are you going to realize
that you are enough?

21:49.563 --> 21:51.357
Who cares what she says?

21:51.357 --> 21:54.818
Why even let any of that shit get to you?

22:00.407 --> 22:01.408
She...

22:03.452 --> 22:05.287
She said I was a bad mother.

22:10.125 --> 22:12.586
Come here. Come here.

22:20.427 --> 22:23.013
She forgets you don't have one.

22:30.562 --> 22:31.563
Hey, you.

22:32.356 --> 22:34.900
You better get that chip
off your shoulder.

22:36.277 --> 22:37.611
I know you hear me.

22:40.155 --> 22:41.156
Come on.

22:46.078 --> 22:48.455
All right, promise me
you're gonna be good for Mommy?

23:17.484 --> 23:18.652
T, don't go up.

23:20.487 --> 23:22.573
We don't really know anybody here.

23:25.326 --> 23:26.327
I lied.

23:33.334 --> 23:35.002
Don't look at me like that.

23:35.002 --> 23:36.170
Get off me.

23:37.504 --> 23:40.299
- Why you being mean to me?
- 'Cause you keep fucking up!

23:40.299 --> 23:41.926
Ow!

23:41.926 --> 23:43.844
Who said you could talk to me like that?

23:43.844 --> 23:46.597
- I liked them!
- Okay, well, yeah. What about me?

23:46.597 --> 23:48.140
What about me, Terry?

23:48.140 --> 23:50.851
Some shit is more important
than some coloring books.

23:59.652 --> 24:01.070
I didn't mean to hurt you.

24:09.787 --> 24:11.538
- Wait right here.

24:22.549 --> 24:24.301
<i>Hey, this is Wanda.</i>

24:24.301 --> 24:26.720
<i>Leave a message after the beep,
and I'll call you back.</i>

24:50.327 --> 24:51.662
<i>Hello?</i>
- Hi. This Cynthia?

24:51.662 --> 24:53.247
-<i>Who this</i>?
- Listen, I need a favor.

24:53.247 --> 24:54.748
-<i>What?</i>
- The building that I'm living in,

24:54.748 --> 24:56.667
it got asbestos,
and they cleared everybody out.

24:56.667 --> 24:58.419
<i>Inez, I'm sorry. You can't stay here.</i>

24:59.753 --> 25:02.381
<i>The number you are calling
is no longer in service.</i>

25:03.299 --> 25:05.134
<i>Hello.</i>
- It's your old hairdresser, Inez.

25:05.134 --> 25:06.552
-<i>You said who?</i>
- Just give me the address,

25:06.552 --> 25:08.554
- and we'll come by later. Terry!
-<i>I did not say...</i>

25:13.392 --> 25:15.227
Terry, are you crazy?
Where were you going!

25:15.227 --> 25:17.396
- Get off me! Get off me!
- Are you crazy?

25:17.396 --> 25:18.939
- Our stuff was in there!

25:56.602 --> 25:58.395
I can't go back to that shelter.

25:59.480 --> 26:00.981
How long you been
on the street?

26:02.107 --> 26:03.108
Long enough.

26:05.986 --> 26:07.112
Where are your people?

26:12.284 --> 26:13.285
Gone.

26:13.911 --> 26:14.912
Gone where?

26:15.704 --> 26:17.206
You from up here?

26:19.792 --> 26:20.918
I lost 'em.

26:21.835 --> 26:23.045
Lost them how?

26:33.681 --> 26:34.682
Yeah.

26:35.683 --> 26:37.059
You and the rest of us.

26:40.521 --> 26:42.648
My baby girl's still struggling.

26:42.648 --> 26:45.192
Her son's about the same age
as your little boy.

26:48.529 --> 26:49.530
Pea?

26:51.073 --> 26:52.283
Pea?

26:52.283 --> 26:54.660
You can take the little room
on the second floor.

26:54.660 --> 26:55.786
Yes?

26:55.786 --> 26:58.622
Clear your things
from Sadie's old room. Mmm?

26:58.622 --> 27:00.040
- Okay?
- Okay.

27:01.083 --> 27:02.835
And like I tell all my tenants,

27:03.544 --> 27:05.713
try anything, I keep a .44 ready.

27:07.631 --> 27:09.425
Go show him where to go, baby.

27:09.425 --> 27:10.551
Is this your house?

27:13.178 --> 27:15.889
Ooh!

27:16.557 --> 27:17.933
Mmm!

27:17.933 --> 27:19.184
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm.

27:19.184 --> 27:21.520
Mmm. Girl.

27:22.062 --> 27:23.564
It's nothing.

27:23.564 --> 27:25.399
Does that mean
I don't have to pay you?

27:27.568 --> 27:28.569
Well...

27:29.695 --> 27:31.530
Girl, I feel like something.

27:40.873 --> 27:42.791
- Thank you, sweetie.
- Mm-hmm.

27:47.004 --> 27:48.756
I can't even get it this time.

27:48.756 --> 27:50.466
Where does the rent go?

27:50.466 --> 27:51.800
That-- No.

27:52.635 --> 27:54.762
Just leave it right there.

27:55.429 --> 27:57.014
Got him.

27:57.014 --> 27:58.390
Yeah.

27:59.433 --> 28:00.434
Oh, no, wait.

28:01.560 --> 28:04.104
- You ever see her?
Who? Oh, Crystal?

28:04.104 --> 28:05.439
Yeah, your daughter.

28:06.065 --> 28:07.066
She, um...

28:09.109 --> 28:11.445
She's cleaned up a few times.

28:12.071 --> 28:13.739
That's a battle I can't fight.

28:15.282 --> 28:17.576
She'll come home for good
when she's ready.

28:21.664 --> 28:23.958
By the way,
if you're still looking for better money,

28:23.958 --> 28:28.712
uh, a friend of mine
might have a job for you.

28:28.712 --> 28:30.631
Really? Where at?

28:30.631 --> 28:33.217
Cleaning staff for a nursing home
on Jamaica Avenue.

28:33.217 --> 28:34.969
- In Queens?
- Yes, Queens.

28:34.969 --> 28:36.428
That's, like, a two-hour train ride.

28:36.428 --> 28:39.515
Well...
...do what you want.

28:39.515 --> 28:42.184
Just don't waste anymore time
feeling sorry for yourself.

28:47.481 --> 28:50.567
Your generation don't know
just how good you have it.

28:58.951 --> 29:01.870
<i>Jaywalking is a fact of life here.</i>

29:01.870 --> 29:03.872
<i>"No more," says Mayor Giuliani.</i>

29:03.872 --> 29:05.916
<i>He plans to crack down on pedestrians</i>

<i>who cross where and when
they're not supposed to.</i>

29:08.127 --> 29:10.004
I'll walk where I want to walk!
Motherfucker...

29:10.004 --> 29:11.547
<i>Plan with me</i>

29:16.927 --> 29:18.887
<i>better than they are right now,</i>

29:18.887 --> 29:21.348
<i>and work hard with me</i>

<i>This is the foundation

29:49.251 --> 29:50.669
Say, "Hi, Mommy."

29:51.378 --> 29:53.047
- Hey.
- Hi.

29:54.131 --> 29:56.175
Tell Mommy what books we read today.

29:57.509 --> 29:58.594
Hey, girl.

30:12.191 --> 30:13.317
The dash is missing.

30:13.984 --> 30:14.985
Huh?

30:17.404 --> 30:18.822
Never mind.

30:25.955 --> 30:27.498
Yo, how much they charge you?

30:28.248 --> 30:30.668
- 350.
- Okay.

30:30.668 --> 30:32.211
You did good, babe.

30:34.588 --> 30:36.257
How you like the job?

30:39.802 --> 30:41.262
I miss doing hair.

30:45.391 --> 30:47.059
He back in school yet?

30:47.810 --> 30:49.311
Hand me a screw.

30:56.568 --> 30:59.405
Got to get a copy
of his birth certificate and all that.

31:02.116 --> 31:04.285
I, um, started applying too.

31:05.953 --> 31:07.997
I'm going to Clark Atlanta in the fall.

31:09.290 --> 31:11.875
- You leaving us?
- I wouldn't say it like that.

31:18.966 --> 31:21.010
I'm happy for you.

31:21.010 --> 31:22.428
You could go back too.

31:23.762 --> 31:26.223
Even if it's part-time
or something like that.

31:28.142 --> 31:29.768
Yeah, someday.

31:35.024 --> 31:36.066
All right, baby.

31:36.066 --> 31:39.695
You got cereal and milk.
Leftovers is in the fridge.

31:39.695 --> 31:42.197
And don't heat it up
for over 60 seconds,

31:42.197 --> 31:44.074
'cause if you do,
your mouth will get burnt.

31:44.074 --> 31:46.994
And do not answer the door for anybody.

31:47.620 --> 31:48.829
If the phone rings,

31:48.829 --> 31:51.332
wait for the answering machine
to come on to see if it's me.

31:53.459 --> 31:54.543
Okay?

31:56.503 --> 31:58.505
I'll be back from work around 6:00.

32:08.057 --> 32:09.058
Okay?

32:09.600 --> 32:10.601
Be good, boo.

32:33.666 --> 32:37.002
<i>Today the streets

32:37.002 --> 32:38.462
<i>You like flying?</i>

32:38.462 --> 32:41.465
<i>I got something
that'll really make you fly.</i>

<i>So talk to your kids

33:04.071 --> 33:06.490
<i>Quincy Jones has made his mark in music</i>

33:06.490 --> 33:09.493
<i>as a composer, conductor

<i>during a time
when it was almost unheard of</i>

33:11.787 --> 33:14.415
<i>for a Black composer
to do a Hollywood movie.</i>

33:15.249 --> 33:19.128
<i>The imagination's always been
a comfort zone, safety zone, really,</i>

33:19.128 --> 33:22.506
<i>because it's something you can run to</i>

<i>and make it anything you want, really.</i>

33:46.405 --> 33:47.406
This house look--

33:52.369 --> 33:53.412
Everything okay?

33:59.126 --> 34:01.462
Why nobody looking for me?

34:04.798 --> 34:06.884
Because we made it too hard for them.

34:08.969 --> 34:10.804
That was the whole point, remember?

34:16.142 --> 34:17.144
Come here.

34:25.986 --> 34:26.987
Hey.

34:32.618 --> 34:33.619
Look.

34:34.495 --> 34:36.622
I don't know what the fuck to tell you, T.

34:37.665 --> 34:40.209
But there's more to life
than fucked-up beginnings.

34:44.588 --> 34:46.173
You're not holding it right!

34:47.548 --> 34:49.677
Hey, talk to me nice. I got this.

34:51.135 --> 34:52.095
You ready?

34:52.095 --> 34:53.805
You ready-ready?

34:57.517 --> 34:58.936
Yeah!

34:58.936 --> 35:01.105
You did it! You did it! You did it!

35:04.650 --> 35:06.360
You gonna throw it all the way over--

35:10.572 --> 35:12.324
Throw that thing better than that.

35:18.789 --> 35:21.375
Now you just being lazy.

35:23.377 --> 35:24.378
You ready?

35:25.796 --> 35:26.797
Yeah.

35:27.756 --> 35:28.799
Mmm.

35:32.469 --> 35:33.637
Ooh!

35:33.637 --> 35:35.347
Okay, yeah, you did it.

35:37.933 --> 35:40.019
I never had my own room growing up.

35:40.936 --> 35:42.187
You wanna try?

35:43.147 --> 35:44.815
Who lived here before us?

35:45.899 --> 35:47.651
I don't know. A bunch of immigrants.

35:47.651 --> 35:49.987
- And before them?
- I don't know, baby.

35:49.987 --> 35:52.072
We can go to the library
and look it up.

35:53.282 --> 35:56.493
Down and up. Down--

36:06.920 --> 36:07.922
Who's that?

36:12.635 --> 36:13.969
This is me.

36:14.845 --> 36:17.222
When I was first coming out
of the group home.

36:18.057 --> 36:19.183
Cute little thing.

36:23.854 --> 36:26.899
My body was a playground for
a thousand niggas before you came along.

36:26.899 --> 36:28.317
- That's nasty.

36:28.317 --> 36:29.860
Hey, I got more of us,

36:29.860 --> 36:32.321
but things get lost
when we moving around so much.

36:32.321 --> 36:34.281
Yo. Open up.
- Hold on, hold on.

36:35.324 --> 36:36.533
It's Rudy.

36:38.285 --> 36:39.954
- Hello.
- Hey.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.753
My bad I'm late.
Some of the papers took longer to get.

36:47.753 --> 36:49.713
What if he needs to go
to the doctor?

36:49.713 --> 36:52.049
Just show up and say he's sick.

36:52.049 --> 36:54.176
And I got one for the city
so it looks legit.

36:54.176 --> 36:55.261
Okay.

36:56.303 --> 36:58.472
Hotbox, numbers.

36:59.431 --> 37:01.392
- Whatever you need, hit me up.
- Okay.

37:01.392 --> 37:02.768
- Okay?
- Okay.

37:07.898 --> 37:11.944
Okay, I went with Daryl,
last name Raymond.

37:11.944 --> 37:14.321
We just moved in from Jersey.

37:14.321 --> 37:16.615
- Your middle name is Terry.

37:16.615 --> 37:18.117
I don't like it.

37:21.954 --> 37:22.955
Hi, Kim.

37:26.709 --> 37:27.960
Daryl Raymond.

37:27.960 --> 37:31.255
<i>...three, two, one. Now!</i>

37:46.687 --> 37:47.688
That's him?

37:53.277 --> 37:55.321
Why you standing there
looking scared?

37:59.366 --> 38:02.369
Neighbor down the hall
walks him home for me after school.

38:04.496 --> 38:06.749
Terry, I want you to meet Lucky.

38:13.213 --> 38:14.214
Hey, Lucky.

38:15.883 --> 38:17.217
What's up, little man?

38:17.927 --> 38:19.887
Lucky's gonna be moving in with us.

38:21.680 --> 38:22.890
For how long?

38:24.892 --> 38:26.018
Damn.

38:29.229 --> 38:32.149
Little nigga trying
to kick me out already.

38:32.149 --> 38:33.400
Come here.

38:40.074 --> 38:41.575
What's this cut on your face?

38:49.333 --> 38:52.586
Let me get one for good luck, babe.
Let me get one for good luck.

38:52.586 --> 38:53.837
Mmm, mmm-mmm-mmm.

38:53.837 --> 38:56.966
You can get a shot. You want a shot?
You can get a shot. Go ahead. Take a shot.

38:57.675 --> 38:59.927
Terry! Terry!

38:59.927 --> 39:01.095
Yeah, get it, Pea!

39:01.095 --> 39:02.680
- Pea, out! Pea, out!
Out of my kitchen!

39:02.680 --> 39:05.140
- Out of my kitchen!
Look at the D! Look at the D!

39:05.140 --> 39:06.934
Good job, Pea.

39:09.937 --> 39:11.730
Shoot! Pass it. Pass it.

39:11.730 --> 39:13.190
- Let me get another.
- No.

39:13.190 --> 39:14.275
Pass it.

39:16.277 --> 39:17.695
Want to go again?

39:20.239 --> 39:21.615
What's wrong?

39:36.964 --> 39:38.382
Where was he before?

39:40.092 --> 39:41.927
How many times
you gonna ask me that?

39:41.927 --> 39:43.095
Till I get an answer.

39:46.098 --> 39:48.309
He belongs with his mother.

39:49.143 --> 39:50.436
Nobody's even looking for him.

39:51.145 --> 39:53.564
Course they're not looking for him
because they're looking for me.

39:53.564 --> 39:56.317
And every other nigga round here
with a target on they back.

39:56.817 --> 39:59.194
Hey, how many times
I been locked up for you, Lucky?

39:59.194 --> 40:00.821
I just got out, man!

40:01.822 --> 40:04.241
Trying to move on from all that shit.

40:04.241 --> 40:07.328
Do you remember what it felt like
to grow up without a father?

40:10.623 --> 40:13.500
Just want us to be a family. That's all.

40:15.461 --> 40:17.046
That's not my fucking kid.

40:19.798 --> 40:21.175
I just wanted you.

40:26.013 --> 40:27.598
But you fucked up in the head.

40:27.598 --> 40:30.351
Yeah, nuts for thinking
you would fucking understand.

40:30.351 --> 40:32.227
I didn't sign up for this shit.

40:39.860 --> 40:41.820
"You are not a cow."

40:41.820 --> 40:45.950
"You are not a boat
or a plane or a snore."

40:45.950 --> 40:47.618
-"Snort."
-"Snort."

40:48.577 --> 40:51.622
- Stop.
-<i>"You are not a boat."</i>

40:51.622 --> 40:53.791
-"Or..."
-"Or a plane

40:53.791 --> 40:55.626
- or a snort."
-"Snort."

40:57.878 --> 40:59.713
"You are my mother."

40:59.713 --> 41:02.299
"You are a bird,

41:02.299 --> 41:03.968
and you are my mother."

41:03.968 --> 41:05.386
Yeah.

41:06.053 --> 41:09.098
"And you are my mother.

41:09.098 --> 41:11.684
And you are my mother.
And you are..."

41:51.056 --> 41:54.101
I literally saw you look at her
with my own eyes.

41:56.437 --> 41:58.063
Is it 'cause she lighter than me?

41:58.939 --> 42:01.191
- 'Cause her hair's nicer?
- You're too sensitive.

42:01.191 --> 42:03.402
Well, then just be sensitive
to my sensitivity.

42:08.907 --> 42:10.784
Where'd you stay this whole time?

42:12.119 --> 42:14.163
Was posted up with Mike.

42:14.163 --> 42:17.082
- That bike not hot, is it?
- No.

42:20.753 --> 42:21.795
One.

42:25.132 --> 42:26.842
All right,
I need another can of broth.

42:29.011 --> 42:30.721
Come on, let me do that after the game.

42:30.721 --> 42:32.640
No. Can you go now?

42:33.349 --> 42:35.309
And why don't you take Terry with you?

42:59.583 --> 43:01.168
How you doing, Lucky?

43:01.168 --> 43:03.379
I'm good, 'Licia.
How you doing, shorty?

43:03.379 --> 43:04.588
You should call me.

43:10.302 --> 43:11.762
Do me a favor.

43:11.762 --> 43:13.555
Walk on this side of me.

43:14.682 --> 43:16.058
It's for your protection.

43:23.148 --> 43:24.525
You always this quiet?

43:28.404 --> 43:29.822
Sometimes.

43:30.447 --> 43:32.157
And what you thinking about?

43:34.368 --> 43:35.869
Well, it sounds like a lot.

43:38.330 --> 43:40.708
How did you get that name Lucky?

43:42.918 --> 43:44.712
Made a few mistakes, that's all.

43:45.713 --> 43:47.339
That's a story for another time.

43:48.382 --> 43:51.594
- And I'm a mistake too?
- Who told you that?

43:51.594 --> 43:53.637
It's why you don't want me around.

43:53.637 --> 43:54.722
That's not true.

43:57.057 --> 43:58.058
You're a blessing.

43:58.851 --> 44:00.352
For your mom especially.

44:02.062 --> 44:03.105
Everything is just...

44:06.233 --> 44:07.693
just complicated.

44:09.194 --> 44:10.988
Aight? Come on.

44:23.208 --> 44:24.668
How'd you get that one?

44:31.258 --> 44:33.010
Guy cut me with a knife.

44:33.010 --> 44:34.094
Why?

44:42.061 --> 44:43.479
He wanted something I took.

45:00.496 --> 45:01.705
You see this one right here?

45:02.957 --> 45:03.958
See it?

45:06.168 --> 45:07.711
On the East Side,

45:07.711 --> 45:10.297
everybody hide they box cutters
right here.

45:10.839 --> 45:12.216
It hurt?

45:14.802 --> 45:16.178
Yeah, a little bit.

45:22.893 --> 45:25.646
<i>HOT 97.</i>

45:34.613 --> 45:36.407
Everything's changing.

45:37.324 --> 45:38.742
A couple of years from now,

45:38.742 --> 45:41.120
we're not gonna have to worry
about this at all.

45:57.219 --> 46:00.097
What do two crooks know
about raising a family?

46:10.190 --> 46:11.358
<i>Yeah!</i>

46:12.192 --> 46:13.319
<i>Yes!</i>

46:13.319 --> 46:14.862
Let me get a picture.

46:14.862 --> 46:16.905
Girl,
he holding you like he love you, okay?

46:16.905 --> 46:18.198
- Terry, now!

46:18.198 --> 46:21.410
And we on the block
right now celebrating.

46:21.410 --> 46:24.038
Shout-out to the newlyweds,
Lucky and Inez.

46:24.038 --> 46:26.665
Yes, girl, show me the ring!
Okay! All right!

46:29.043 --> 46:30.544
What the ring like?

46:31.086 --> 46:33.130
That's exactly
what we bringing here to the block.

46:33.130 --> 46:34.506
Right here, right now.

46:34.506 --> 46:36.967
Come get a plate. Come get a cup.

46:36.967 --> 46:40.095
Come get whatever you need,
and come rock out with your boy.

46:40.095 --> 46:41.263
Come here.

46:42.056 --> 46:44.558
You look good, ma.
You look good!

46:46.185 --> 46:47.186
T...

46:50.689 --> 46:52.149
your mother's my wife now.

46:53.859 --> 46:56.028
But I want you to know
from the bottom of my heart

46:56.028 --> 46:57.696
that I'm here for the both of you.

47:00.532 --> 47:01.825
We blood now.

47:05.079 --> 47:06.747
You scared
I'ma take her away from you?

47:06.747 --> 47:07.957
No.

47:09.583 --> 47:11.710
Nobody's going anywhere,
from this point on.

47:13.754 --> 47:15.714
I promise
to protect you and your mother.

47:16.882 --> 47:17.925
You understand?

47:18.926 --> 47:19.969
Yes.

47:20.928 --> 47:23.180
We're gonna give you
the life that we never had.

47:24.932 --> 47:27.726
Aight? You hear me?

47:28.269 --> 47:29.395
Mmm?

47:31.772 --> 47:32.856
Come here.

47:37.778 --> 47:40.531
Up-up-up. There we go. There we go.

47:40.531 --> 47:42.783
Girl, you got you a family now.

47:42.783 --> 47:45.327
Whoo!

47:45.327 --> 47:47.621
King of the world!

47:47.621 --> 47:48.664
Aw.

47:48.664 --> 47:50.666
We got to get this.
Hold on, hold on. Here we go.

47:50.666 --> 47:51.959
Wait.
- Look at the camera, T.

47:51.959 --> 47:53.836
- Look at the camera.
- Ready?

47:53.836 --> 47:54.962
Ah!

47:55.671 --> 47:57.047
Say, "Family!"

47:57.047 --> 47:58.257
Family.

48:04.763 --> 48:06.265
I'm so happy for y'all.

48:21.989 --> 48:23.157
Let me see.

48:41.300 --> 48:42.760
What you want to hear?

48:43.802 --> 48:45.846
- That one.

48:46.764 --> 48:49.516
<i>If Federal Court
lets new zoning laws take effect,</i>

48:49.516 --> 48:50.601
<i>starting today,</i>

48:50.601 --> 48:53.646
<i>42nd Street will have
to take on a different look, or else.</i>

48:53.646 --> 48:56.065
<i>According to the mayor,
the crackdown on low-level offenses</i>

48:56.065 --> 48:57.274
<i>is a quality-of-life issue.</i>

48:57.274 --> 48:59.652
<i>If you change, in fact,</i>

48:59.652 --> 49:01.695
<i>the true nature of the establishment,</i>

49:01.695 --> 49:03.530
<i>then you probably have a defense
under the law.</i>

49:03.530 --> 49:05.407
Turn it up!
<i>Today, at 11:00,</i>

49:05.407 --> 49:07.242
<i>the police officer said
he sodomized Abner Louima</i>

49:07.242 --> 49:08.535
<i>in the presence of another officer,</i>

49:08.535 --> 49:10.746
<i>although, he did not implicate
any of the four other officers.</i>

49:10.746 --> 49:13.332
<i>...there are serious questions
about police practice and race.</i>

49:13.332 --> 49:15.250
-<i>A young African immigrant died...</i>
Shit's fucked up!

49:15.250 --> 49:17.878
<i>...when four plainclothes cops
shot him 19 times,</i>

49:17.878 --> 49:19.630
<i>firing 41 bullets.</i>

49:19.630 --> 49:22.424
<i>The shock waves are still
being felt in New York City tonight</i>

49:22.424 --> 49:25.010
<i>following the acquittals

49:25.010 --> 49:27.972
<i>An officer
is allowed to stop, question you,</i>

49:27.972 --> 49:30.766
<i>if he develops any more suspicions,
he can frisk you.</i>

49:30.766 --> 49:32.810
<i>So really, it should be described as</i>

49:32.810 --> 49:36.188
<i>stop-question-frisk.</i>

49:41.443 --> 49:42.444
Yer.

49:42.444 --> 49:43.570
What up, T?

49:44.363 --> 49:45.364
Yer.

49:47.199 --> 49:48.659
How you been?

49:48.659 --> 49:50.661
I'm not starting freshman year
without no pussy, B.

49:50.661 --> 49:53.330
Light skin, fatty, exotic,

49:53.330 --> 49:55.666
hair down to the ass,
no medium to hot breath...

49:55.666 --> 49:56.792
Them shorties
don't want you.

49:56.792 --> 49:59.795
No, nigga, that's standards.
Don't fault me for caring about my heart.

50:01.714 --> 50:02.715
Go get that!

50:04.758 --> 50:06.844
Nah. Nah.

50:06.844 --> 50:08.512
- I'm good.
-"Nah." Keep not listening.

50:08.512 --> 50:09.680
I am listening!

50:09.680 --> 50:11.557
See how they respond
to that nice shit, man?

50:11.557 --> 50:14.393
- What's good with that?
- I just got my own style.

50:14.393 --> 50:16.604
Since when is "bum nigga" a style?

50:16.604 --> 50:18.939
Hey, hey! You, you. Now.
Up against the wall, right now.

50:18.939 --> 50:20.691
Yeah, just put your hands
where I can see 'em.

50:20.691 --> 50:22.901
- Don't make any sudden move.
Damn, bro.

50:22.901 --> 50:24.153
Thought you looked older.

50:24.153 --> 50:26.530
<i>Daryl can be a little aloof sometimes.</i>

50:26.530 --> 50:28.365
He daydreams a lot.

50:28.365 --> 50:31.285
But, overall, he's a very bright kid.

50:31.285 --> 50:33.787
I was surprised to see
that you were his mother.

50:33.787 --> 50:37.750
Most of our students here
aren't as articulate.

50:40.628 --> 50:42.379
Oh, is that so?

50:42.379 --> 50:45.716
To be honest, Mrs. Raymond, um,

50:46.842 --> 50:48.969
I don't think Daryl belongs here.

50:50.054 --> 50:54.016
Have you thought about applying
to the specialized high schools?

50:55.267 --> 50:56.268
No.

50:56.977 --> 50:58.771
I'd like you to meet Ms. Tucker.

50:58.771 --> 51:00.105
Hi.

51:00.105 --> 51:02.816
She's a counselor
at Tech, Science and Leadership.

51:02.816 --> 51:05.736
I also run an outreach program
on the side

51:05.736 --> 51:08.489
to get more students like Daryl
to take the test.

51:09.740 --> 51:11.992
Would you be open to that, Daryl?

51:14.536 --> 51:16.038
If they got girls.

51:17.164 --> 51:21.585
A lot of the kids
go on to MIT, Harvard.

51:21.585 --> 51:23.712
It might take some getting used to.

51:23.712 --> 51:26.465
There wouldn't be as many minorities.

51:26.465 --> 51:28.092
Ma, you know
the laundromat shut down?

51:28.092 --> 51:30.094
Yeah. They sold the building.

51:30.094 --> 51:31.679
So, where we supposed to go?

51:32.513 --> 51:35.307
Go down to Ramirez.
What's a couple of blocks?

51:36.016 --> 51:37.518
I don't like going over there.

51:38.477 --> 51:39.478
Well...

51:41.438 --> 51:42.898
We got stopped by the cops again.

51:45.401 --> 51:47.403
Um, were they looking for someone?

51:47.403 --> 51:48.487
I don't know.

51:49.113 --> 51:50.489
Did they take your name?

51:51.365 --> 51:52.366
No.

51:52.908 --> 51:55.202
I'm just calling it out
so you know it ain't me.

51:57.371 --> 52:00.040
Girl, and then
he talk about he want to move in.

52:00.040 --> 52:01.709
I'm like, "Are you paying half the rent?"

52:01.709 --> 52:04.128
- Hey, girl. How you doing?
- Hey, girl, what's up?

52:04.128 --> 52:05.754
Hello.

52:05.754 --> 52:07.631
Girl, so you know,
like, I'm a woman.

52:07.631 --> 52:10.134
I shouldn't be paying rent
if a man stay here.

52:10.134 --> 52:12.428
- You know what I'm saying?
- What's going on over there?

52:12.428 --> 52:13.887
Girl, you know
they bought the building.

52:15.723 --> 52:18.142
But anyway, girl,
what you think I should do, though?

52:18.142 --> 52:20.978
You think I should,
like, split the rent?

52:20.978 --> 52:22.271
Girl, I don't know.

52:22.271 --> 52:24.523
Right, 'cause I ain't doing that.

52:31.488 --> 52:33.073
Ah!
- Scared me half to death!

52:33.073 --> 52:35.075
- Here, let me get that.
- Anything else?

52:36.535 --> 52:37.911
Mom, I'm hungry.

52:39.496 --> 52:41.332
Well then, go to the store.

52:41.332 --> 52:42.416
With what money?

52:42.416 --> 52:44.543
I gave you money earlier this week, Terry.

52:44.543 --> 52:46.253
Come on.

52:48.297 --> 52:51.425
Look, I only got ten dollars to my name.
I'm giving you five.

52:52.551 --> 52:53.552
Here.

52:58.557 --> 53:00.684
You thought any more about what she said?

53:00.684 --> 53:03.228
- Who said?
- Your teacher.

53:03.228 --> 53:05.481
Why does everything good mean
I got to go somewhere else?

53:06.440 --> 53:07.650
Well...

53:10.444 --> 53:12.029
- You'll probably fit right in.

53:12.029 --> 53:15.282
As soft as you are, I'd rather that
than you chasing after Pea.

53:16.033 --> 53:17.785
Speaking of him,
I'm switching to the night shift

53:17.785 --> 53:19.578
so I can be here after school.

53:20.287 --> 53:22.247
Make sure you're not just running around.

53:22.247 --> 53:23.749
What's up with you and Luck?

53:25.250 --> 53:26.585
Excuse me?

53:26.585 --> 53:28.337
Y'all not talking or something?

53:32.967 --> 53:35.469
Stop trying to change the subject.

53:38.138 --> 53:39.223
Listen.

53:40.307 --> 53:42.101
I'm not saying you gotta go.

53:42.810 --> 53:44.353
But at least think about it.

53:46.105 --> 53:48.023
I'll buy you a new pair of Jordans.

53:51.110 --> 53:52.569
In each portion,

53:52.569 --> 53:55.322
you will have approximately ten minutes
per section...

54:23.601 --> 54:26.186
You want me to pull up there
with you or something?

54:26.186 --> 54:27.771
'Cause you acting mad-pussy right now.

54:37.990 --> 54:39.325
Anything else?

54:39.325 --> 54:41.160
Yeah, where can I call you?

54:42.536 --> 54:44.079
Simone, quit playing!

54:44.079 --> 54:47.499
- Aight, give me your name on AOL.
-"Unavailable222."

54:47.499 --> 54:48.959
Wow.
So I can't even get to know you?

54:48.959 --> 54:50.044
Yeah, get her, T.

54:50.044 --> 54:53.088
Listen, there's nothing else
I need to know about you

54:53.088 --> 54:55.966
or your little dirty-ass,
smelly-ass friend.

54:55.966 --> 54:58.677
Stop acting like
we ain't doing you a favor, Midnight.

54:58.677 --> 55:01.764
- Nappy-head ass.
Next customer.

55:07.895 --> 55:09.271
Knew you wasn't getting that.

55:10.230 --> 55:11.315
I ain't tripping on her.

55:11.315 --> 55:13.233
'Cause I already tried four times.

55:13.233 --> 55:15.778
- Got to be a dyke!
- Shut the hell up, Pea.

55:15.778 --> 55:18.113
That's why I want one
of them Indian-looking girls.

55:18.113 --> 55:19.490
Shoot, they fire.

55:19.490 --> 55:22.576
Let me see. Let me see it.

55:24.411 --> 55:25.412
Oh, my...

55:26.413 --> 55:27.915
You got into Tech?

55:28.582 --> 55:30.000
I don't see the big deal.

55:30.000 --> 55:32.753
Thought all I had to do
was prove that I can get in.

55:33.712 --> 55:34.964
I changed my mind.

55:34.964 --> 55:36.840
Well, I didn't! I ain't going!

55:37.424 --> 55:40.803
Boy, you know how hard I'm busting my ass
to get you chances I never had?

55:42.388 --> 55:43.931
You make me feel like a damn fool.

55:43.931 --> 55:46.600
- Be a fool, then.
- Boy!

55:50.813 --> 55:53.816
I need you to talk some sense
into him. Please.

55:58.612 --> 56:00.531
Saying what, exactly?

56:00.531 --> 56:02.616
That he should go
to a better school.

56:04.743 --> 56:06.203
He doesn't want to be controlled.

56:06.203 --> 56:08.497
Who gives a fuck
about what he wants?

56:08.497 --> 56:09.957
What does he need?

56:11.250 --> 56:12.376
I don't know.

56:21.802 --> 56:23.387
Matter of fact, I do.

56:25.889 --> 56:27.182
It's you.

56:28.142 --> 56:29.602
Like how?

56:31.145 --> 56:32.646
You're too tough.

56:36.483 --> 56:38.402
Okay. What else?

56:38.402 --> 56:39.862
I'm listening.

56:43.449 --> 56:45.618
Maybe if you quiet down some...

56:48.203 --> 56:50.164
he would actually hear
what you have to say.

56:54.418 --> 56:55.586
Okay.

56:55.586 --> 56:58.672
I don't even remember
the last time I raised my voice.

56:59.506 --> 57:02.009
He'd do good at any school.

57:11.185 --> 57:13.646
You used to like when I got spicy.

57:17.149 --> 57:19.276
"Try and be quiet."

57:21.695 --> 57:24.073
"You should try and be quiet."

57:24.073 --> 57:25.324
Right?

57:26.867 --> 57:28.786
Quiet like when
you went missing for weeks,

57:28.786 --> 57:30.579
and I sat here and said nothing?

57:31.580 --> 57:33.791
- And never mind who you was with.
- See, there it go.

57:33.791 --> 57:37.002
If I get any more quieter,
I won't even have a fucking voice at all.

57:37.002 --> 57:38.754
I'm not about to sit here
and argue with you.

57:38.754 --> 57:41.882
That's real easy for you to say,
'cause you get to be the saint, right?

57:41.882 --> 57:43.133
You get to be the saint,

57:43.133 --> 57:45.177
while I'm stuck here
fighting these wars all by myself.

57:45.177 --> 57:47.263
- See how loud you're getting?
- What...

57:47.263 --> 57:49.890
- Well, then fucking show up for me, Lucky.
- Fuck this shit.

57:50.891 --> 57:52.393
Show up for me!

58:01.235 --> 58:03.862
I wonder what'd happen if I leave too.

58:19.169 --> 58:20.838
You scared.

58:23.882 --> 58:25.593
Something's gonna happen.

58:28.596 --> 58:30.806
I can feel it.

58:32.474 --> 58:34.101
- I can feel it.

58:34.101 --> 58:36.895
Did he tell you
he got stopped by the cops again?

58:37.980 --> 58:39.315
A few times.

58:40.899 --> 58:42.776
Then let him use his other name.

58:43.986 --> 58:46.780
- He doesn't have an--
- That's not the fucking point, Lucky!

58:48.240 --> 58:50.701
Shit. I don't know, aight?

58:50.701 --> 58:53.287
They's bound to come any-fucking-where.

59:14.808 --> 59:16.644
Take care of your moms, T!

59:17.811 --> 59:19.355
Where Luck going?

59:19.355 --> 59:21.857
And you-- I'ma say this one time.

59:21.857 --> 59:23.817
You look at me when I'm fucking talking.

59:25.110 --> 59:29.073
It's either you go to that school,
or you find somewhere else to live.

59:29.073 --> 59:30.157
You hear me?

1:00:07.903 --> 1:00:09.613
<i>...where to push
and where not to push.</i>

1:00:09.613 --> 1:00:12.241
<i>But I'ma take but so much,
and she gon' take but so much,</i>

1:00:12.241 --> 1:00:14.076
<i>so we compromise.</i>

1:00:14.076 --> 1:00:17.871
<i>It works out for you guys.
So, you gonna get married or...</i>

1:00:18.539 --> 1:00:20.958
<i>Uh--</i>
<i>All right, all right, all right.</i>

1:00:20.958 --> 1:00:22.126
<i>That's a whole 'nother show.</i>

1:00:22.126 --> 1:00:23.877
<i>I'm sorry. You had a comment. Yes?</i>

1:00:23.877 --> 1:00:25.838
<i>You say you do it for the attention.</i>

1:00:25.838 --> 1:00:27.298
<i>There are other ways of getting attention.</i>

1:00:27.298 --> 1:00:30.134
<i>Doesn't it cost you a lot of friendships
and relationships, being a bitch?</i>

1:00:30.134 --> 1:00:33.971
<i>Well, it has cost me a lot
of friendships and a lot of relationships,</i>

1:00:33.971 --> 1:00:36.599
<i>but I find in life that sometimes,</i>

1:00:36.599 --> 1:00:39.435
<i>having a friend in yourself
is better than having--</i>

1:00:39.435 --> 1:00:40.978
<i>worrying about having people
as your friends,</i>

1:00:40.978 --> 1:00:42.730
<i>'cause no one's
gonna look out for you but you,</i>

1:00:42.730 --> 1:00:44.481
-<i>and I've learned that in life.</i>

1:00:44.481 --> 1:00:47.067
<i>I've looked out for people,
you know, but--</i>

1:00:47.901 --> 1:00:49.987
<i>You seem to make some sense.</i>

1:00:49.987 --> 1:00:53.115
<i>I mean, I'm saying,
I have friends now.</i>

1:00:53.115 --> 1:00:55.993
-<i>They're bitchy like me, so we get along.</i>

1:00:55.993 --> 1:00:58.454
<i>We-- I'm serious.
We understand each other.</i>

1:00:58.454 --> 1:01:00.789
-<i>And, like, I'm generous...</i>
<i>They got a little dog pound.</i>

1:01:00.789 --> 1:01:03.834
<i>Right. And I help--
I help out some of my family members,</i>

1:01:03.834 --> 1:01:05.294
<i>as well as they help me.</i>

1:01:05.294 --> 1:01:08.380
<i>But they also know
where to push my buttons</i>

1:01:08.380 --> 1:01:10.841
<i>and where to go also, as Paul said.</i>

1:01:10.841 --> 1:01:11.926
<i>Okay, yes?</i>

1:01:11.926 --> 1:01:13.844
<i>I know I like to get what I want,</i>

1:01:13.844 --> 1:01:15.512
<i>but I think there are other ways
to do that--</i>

1:01:15.512 --> 1:01:17.181
<i>That only makes people...</i>

1:01:36.450 --> 1:01:38.577
- Come shoot some hoops with me.

1:01:38.577 --> 1:01:40.037
I'm about to go to the store.

1:01:40.788 --> 1:01:41.956
Come here.

1:01:48.337 --> 1:01:49.713
You need some money?

1:01:49.713 --> 1:01:51.507
- Ma gave me some.
- Here.

1:01:53.634 --> 1:01:54.802
Take it anyway.

1:01:55.970 --> 1:01:58.430
A man should always have some money
in his pocket.

1:02:01.433 --> 1:02:03.769
So, um, where you been at?

1:02:15.155 --> 1:02:16.782
I needed some time to clear my head.

1:02:24.415 --> 1:02:26.959
Feels like it's been a lot longer
than that this time.

1:02:27.835 --> 1:02:29.503
Y'all breaking up or something?

1:02:33.215 --> 1:02:34.550
Want to shoot?

1:02:47.354 --> 1:02:49.106
Your mother ever tell you how we met?

1:02:54.028 --> 1:02:55.070
No.

1:02:55.070 --> 1:02:58.866
She used to work at this coffee shop
that closed down a few years ago.

1:02:59.658 --> 1:03:01.952
I used to get my hair cut
right across the street.

1:03:01.952 --> 1:03:04.246
I'd go in,
I'd order me a bagel or whatever.

1:03:04.246 --> 1:03:06.999
But I'm still not sure
how I'ma kick it to her.

1:03:07.875 --> 1:03:09.710
And ended up telling her the truth.

1:03:12.588 --> 1:03:14.715
That she was the most beautiful woman...

1:03:17.217 --> 1:03:18.677
that I ever seen.

1:03:23.057 --> 1:03:24.516
Were you nervous?

1:03:28.687 --> 1:03:30.564
I just felt like she should know.

1:03:33.067 --> 1:03:35.069
But something told me to go back, right?

1:03:36.528 --> 1:03:38.697
This is when I had my other bike.

1:03:38.697 --> 1:03:43.243
A few days later,
I said, "Let me take you for a ride."

1:03:44.161 --> 1:03:46.080
We been rocking ever since.

1:03:56.924 --> 1:03:58.092
T...

1:04:01.595 --> 1:04:04.306
don't get caught up in none of this shit
that you see around here.

1:04:04.306 --> 1:04:05.516
Have I ever?

1:04:08.060 --> 1:04:09.895
Took me too long to learn that.

1:04:10.562 --> 1:04:14.108
I don't want to see you fall into
the same traps as me and your mother.

1:04:18.112 --> 1:04:20.114
I want you
to make better choices than me.

1:04:20.948 --> 1:04:22.741
When it comes to her.

1:04:23.284 --> 1:04:24.827
When it comes to everything.

1:04:31.208 --> 1:04:32.209
I, uh...

1:04:34.211 --> 1:04:36.422
I got into the specialized high school.

1:04:37.464 --> 1:04:39.133
Oh, yeah?

1:04:40.259 --> 1:04:42.553
- So what you gon' do?
- I don't know.

1:04:43.596 --> 1:04:45.055
What you think?

1:04:45.055 --> 1:04:46.473
It's not up to me, T.

1:04:49.101 --> 1:04:50.603
You getting older now.

1:04:52.313 --> 1:04:54.565
Time for you
to start thinking for yourself.

1:05:21.342 --> 1:05:22.635
What?

1:05:28.390 --> 1:05:29.725
I love you.

1:05:31.226 --> 1:05:33.228
You hear me?

1:05:33.228 --> 1:05:34.313
Yeah.

1:05:37.358 --> 1:05:38.525
Check up.

1:05:45.699 --> 1:05:47.034
Oh, got it.

1:05:50.496 --> 1:05:52.206
Psst, psst.

1:05:52.206 --> 1:05:53.832
Ayo, ma!

1:05:55.626 --> 1:05:57.336
What are you doing here?

1:05:57.336 --> 1:05:59.421
I can't walk with my lady?

1:06:14.228 --> 1:06:17.231
- How was work?
- Good.

1:06:17.231 --> 1:06:20.276
Good morning.

1:06:20.276 --> 1:06:22.528
Yo, you remember what it's like
when we were coming up?

1:06:22.528 --> 1:06:23.612
I remember.

1:06:23.612 --> 1:06:26.782
You should be proud of yourself, Inez.

1:06:27.700 --> 1:06:29.076
We made it.

1:06:36.250 --> 1:06:38.043
You don't seem happy.

1:06:42.673 --> 1:06:44.425
Think Terry resents me?

1:06:47.678 --> 1:06:49.179
Teenagers hate everybody.

1:06:49.179 --> 1:06:51.348
But I do sense a little void in him.

1:06:52.266 --> 1:06:55.019
First couple years of his life,
he ain't had nobody.

1:06:55.019 --> 1:06:57.896
Kid's still walking around here
with a broken heart.

1:07:00.691 --> 1:07:03.027
Maybe it's time for y'all
to have that conversation.

1:07:04.278 --> 1:07:07.072
Give him some of the answers
that he been looking for.

1:07:09.116 --> 1:07:11.452
Yeah, I'll know when the time's right.

1:07:15.873 --> 1:07:16.957
Um...

1:07:18.292 --> 1:07:20.210
I was thinking,
when Terry goes off to school,

1:07:20.210 --> 1:07:23.213
maybe I'll get to doing hair again.

1:07:23.213 --> 1:07:25.049
Maybe open up a shop.

1:07:28.802 --> 1:07:30.304
Can't wait.

1:07:41.023 --> 1:07:42.316
<i>Thank you.</i>

1:07:43.651 --> 1:07:47.279
<i>Citizens, I am honored
and humbled to serve</i>

1:07:47.279 --> 1:07:50.491
<i>as the 108th mayor
of the city of New York.</i>

1:07:50.491 --> 1:07:53.077
<i>As Toni Morrison has said,</i>

1:07:53.077 --> 1:07:56.038
<i>"New York is the last true city."</i>

1:07:56.038 --> 1:08:01.085
<i>And it is the vitality
of our neighborhoods that define us.</i>

1:08:01.085 --> 1:08:02.711
<i>In the next four years,</i>

1:08:02.711 --> 1:08:06.257
<i>I will devote myself
to building a better New York--</i>

1:08:06.257 --> 1:08:07.508
<i>safe, strong</i>

1:08:07.508 --> 1:08:10.928
<i>and ready to lead the world
in the 21st century.</i>

1:08:10.928 --> 1:08:12.429
<i>Thank you.</i>

1:08:16.809 --> 1:08:20.728
<i>I, Michael R. Bloomberg,
mayor of the city of New York...</i>

1:08:20.728 --> 1:08:23.440
<i>Do solemnly swear...</i>
-<i>Do solemnly swear...</i>

1:08:23.440 --> 1:08:24.775
<i>That I will...</i>

1:08:31.115 --> 1:08:33.992
So, um, which one you, uh...

1:08:34.660 --> 1:08:36.328
which one you want to hear?

1:08:40.666 --> 1:08:42.793
Let me hear that one.

1:08:42.793 --> 1:08:45.129
It's mad old, though.

1:08:46.170 --> 1:08:47.464
Old?

1:08:47.464 --> 1:08:49.300
The fuck is The Delfonics, B?

1:08:49.300 --> 1:08:51.134
Why don't you pass me
that one right there.

1:08:51.134 --> 1:08:53.053
- Yeah, who?
- Yeah.

1:08:59.393 --> 1:09:00.477
What does it say?

1:09:03.856 --> 1:09:05.441
The sample.

1:09:05.441 --> 1:09:08.819
Wasn't too old for the Fugees.

1:09:10.821 --> 1:09:13.782
Yo, come on.

1:09:13.782 --> 1:09:15.492
You don't even know your own taste.

1:09:15.492 --> 1:09:18.495
Yo, these shits is, like,
mad random, though, like...

1:09:19.413 --> 1:09:22.333
Yo, you deadass a old head.
Like, what are you talking about?

1:09:22.333 --> 1:09:25.501
Cassettes in here. What's going on?

1:09:25.501 --> 1:09:27.463
- Come on.

1:09:29.882 --> 1:09:30.925
T.

1:09:32.134 --> 1:09:34.428
Hey, I want you to hang on to that.

1:09:37.598 --> 1:09:41.059
That way, you can take your time
flipping through everything.

1:09:46.440 --> 1:09:48.442
So, which college you decided on?

1:09:50.902 --> 1:09:51.904
I don't know yet.

1:09:51.904 --> 1:09:53.864
You should be more excited.

1:09:55.908 --> 1:09:57.076
Nah.

1:09:58.994 --> 1:10:01.038
- I am.
- Aight.

1:10:01.038 --> 1:10:02.289
Well, go somewhere far.

1:10:03.290 --> 1:10:04.625
You know, my era,

1:10:06.460 --> 1:10:08.295
we ain't get those kind of shots.

1:10:09.004 --> 1:10:10.297
Yeah.

1:10:10.923 --> 1:10:12.258
Maybe.

1:10:13.008 --> 1:10:15.636
Go on and show off
that legacy of Harlem.

1:10:24.311 --> 1:10:26.480
Hi. I'm Jerry.

1:10:27.481 --> 1:10:29.483
Uh, I'm your new landlord.

1:10:31.902 --> 1:10:35.239
The lady across the hall said
that your husband has cancer.

1:10:35.239 --> 1:10:36.490
Really sorry to hear that.

1:10:37.449 --> 1:10:38.867
It's all right.

1:10:38.867 --> 1:10:41.412
So you own those buildings
across the street too?

1:10:41.412 --> 1:10:42.997
Yeah. Yeah.

1:10:43.956 --> 1:10:46.417
Everything working okay?

1:10:46.417 --> 1:10:49.878
Heat coming up?
Hot water? All that?

1:10:49.878 --> 1:10:51.839
I actually just realized that, um,

1:10:51.839 --> 1:10:54.592
I got a few loose tiles
around my shower area.

1:10:54.592 --> 1:10:56.969
Oh! Yeah. Let's go look at it.

1:10:57.678 --> 1:10:58.846
Uh-oh.

1:11:00.848 --> 1:11:02.016
Something happen here?

1:11:02.975 --> 1:11:04.435
Yeah.

1:11:04.435 --> 1:11:08.147
We tried to fix it a few times,
but it keeps falling off.

1:11:09.857 --> 1:11:11.984
- I can fix this for you.
- Really?

1:11:11.984 --> 1:11:14.320
Yeah.
This is no problem at all.

1:11:15.529 --> 1:11:16.947
Um...

1:11:16.947 --> 1:11:18.198
Wow.

1:11:18.741 --> 1:11:20.534
Maybe some new cabinets, too,

1:11:20.534 --> 1:11:23.537
because these have to be
at least 20 years old.

1:11:24.163 --> 1:11:26.582
- Have you met Javier?
- Who?

1:11:26.582 --> 1:11:29.126
- Uh, the new super.
- No.

1:11:29.126 --> 1:11:32.296
Okay, let me see
when I can get my guys in here

1:11:32.296 --> 1:11:34.632
to take care of all of this,

1:11:34.632 --> 1:11:37.801
- and then also your tiles, okay?

1:11:37.801 --> 1:11:40.387
- Thank you.
- Yeah. You got it. No problem.

1:11:42.598 --> 1:11:43.682
Hey.

1:11:51.523 --> 1:11:53.192
Anybody else come by?

1:11:57.404 --> 1:11:58.739
How you feeling?

1:14:20.214 --> 1:14:23.717
Yeah, I-- I just wanted to let you know
I think you're the most, uh...

1:14:26.262 --> 1:14:30.641
well, you're the most, uh, beautiful girl,
you know, or whatever, you know.

1:14:30.641 --> 1:14:32.142
I was just trying to see if you...

1:14:32.142 --> 1:14:34.728
Would you please
stop fucking calling here? I'm working.

1:14:38.941 --> 1:14:40.276
Well, call me tonight, then.

1:14:43.612 --> 1:14:44.863
Fine.

1:14:52.204 --> 1:14:53.747
To stay or to go?

1:14:54.415 --> 1:14:57.751
Look. The whole sink is gone.
Look at the hole by the shower.

1:14:58.544 --> 1:15:00.754
It wasn't so big at first,

1:15:00.754 --> 1:15:03.841
but more fell down this morning.

1:15:03.841 --> 1:15:05.509
All we got left is the kitchen sink.

1:15:05.509 --> 1:15:09.305
Yeah, I know. I know. I know.

1:15:09.972 --> 1:15:13.309
- Let me show you the kitchen.
- No, no, I already saw it.

1:15:13.309 --> 1:15:14.727
Um...

1:15:17.146 --> 1:15:20.107
Inez, this--
this is my... this is my mistake.

1:15:20.107 --> 1:15:23.277
The guys,
they thought this was a full flip,

1:15:23.277 --> 1:15:24.528
like some of the other units,

1:15:24.528 --> 1:15:27.489
so I'm happy to have them
come back in and finish up,

1:15:27.489 --> 1:15:29.450
and I won't charge you anything or...

1:15:29.450 --> 1:15:31.535
Okay, yeah, just let me know the day.

1:15:31.535 --> 1:15:34.538
I can stay home from work or Terry
could be here, if it's after school.

1:15:34.538 --> 1:15:38.250
Well, we'd actually need you to--
uh, to clear out of the apartment.

1:15:38.250 --> 1:15:40.210
'Cause there's--
there's just too much damage.

1:15:40.210 --> 1:15:42.379
I mean, everything's got to get lifted--

1:15:42.379 --> 1:15:43.464
Like how long?

1:15:43.464 --> 1:15:46.133
I mean, as long as it--
you know, until it's done.

1:15:46.133 --> 1:15:47.384
A couple months.

1:15:47.384 --> 1:15:49.219
What are we supposed to do
in the meantime?

1:15:49.219 --> 1:15:50.971
- Calm down.
- Don't tell me to calm down.

1:15:50.971 --> 1:15:52.640
Like two adults, okay?

1:15:53.349 --> 1:15:55.225
There's no reason here to get loud.

1:15:57.978 --> 1:16:01.565
We have no bathroom,
no shower, Jerry.

1:16:02.650 --> 1:16:05.945
- We have no stove, Jerry.

1:16:05.945 --> 1:16:09.531
Is-- There's not, like, a family member
or a friend you could stay with?

1:16:10.449 --> 1:16:12.576
Look, this building is too old.

1:16:12.576 --> 1:16:14.244
I come in and fix something,

1:16:14.244 --> 1:16:17.206
I got to come back a couple months later
and do it again.

1:16:17.206 --> 1:16:20.250
You know, this way, we come in here,

1:16:20.250 --> 1:16:22.419
we replace everything all at once.

1:16:22.419 --> 1:16:24.797
There's got to be another option.

1:16:24.797 --> 1:16:26.507
Or you could leave.

1:16:31.971 --> 1:16:33.555
My hands are tied.

1:16:33.555 --> 1:16:35.975
Give me a call.
Let me know what you decide.

1:16:41.855 --> 1:16:44.233

1:17:16.932 --> 1:17:18.142
Hey, yo, home.

1:17:20.060 --> 1:17:21.854
Can you walk
on the other side of me?

1:17:22.563 --> 1:17:23.814
Hmm?

1:17:23.814 --> 1:17:25.899
It's for your protection.

1:17:29.069 --> 1:17:30.070
Come on.

1:17:45.252 --> 1:17:47.254
Think you put enough?

1:17:47.254 --> 1:17:49.089
You know you want one.

1:17:49.590 --> 1:17:50.674
Mmm.

1:17:50.674 --> 1:17:53.302
Why you always acting all stank
whenever we come around?

1:17:53.302 --> 1:17:57.306
That's not a act. Your friends
are dumb as fuck, especially Pea.

1:17:57.306 --> 1:17:59.725
"What you gonna do about that kitchen?"

1:17:59.725 --> 1:18:02.269
"Damn, when you gonna eat
some more meals?"

1:18:02.269 --> 1:18:05.481
-"Wow! What up, Midnight?"

1:18:05.481 --> 1:18:07.274
Aight, aight. I get it. I get it.

1:18:08.776 --> 1:18:10.861
I'm sorry. I know those are your friends.

1:18:10.861 --> 1:18:12.112
Is that how you act too?

1:18:17.034 --> 1:18:18.619
You see me here, right?

1:18:19.662 --> 1:18:22.414
I'm not here for anybody
trying to make me hate myself.

1:18:26.126 --> 1:18:29.088
So how'd you miss a year of school
and still end up at Tech?

1:18:29.088 --> 1:18:30.172
You like it?

1:18:32.508 --> 1:18:33.509
It's okay.

1:18:33.509 --> 1:18:36.470
Okay? And? What else?
What don't you like about it?

1:18:37.054 --> 1:18:41.517
I don't know. Just don't.

1:18:42.977 --> 1:18:45.145
There's nothing wrong
with being smart, you know.

1:18:45.854 --> 1:18:47.648
We could use a few more engineers
around here.

1:18:47.648 --> 1:18:49.483
I just don't care
about none of that, though.

1:18:49.483 --> 1:18:51.485
Okay. So, what you want to do?

1:18:52.361 --> 1:18:53.654
Oh.

1:18:53.654 --> 1:18:57.116
I mean, I like a lot of things, you know. Uh...

1:18:58.659 --> 1:19:01.078
Right now, I'm-- I'm into music.

1:19:01.829 --> 1:19:02.997
You want to rap?

1:19:02.997 --> 1:19:04.623
Nah. Like...

1:19:06.458 --> 1:19:07.459
Like, uh...

1:19:09.670 --> 1:19:11.088
You ever seen <i>The Wiz</i>?

1:19:11.755 --> 1:19:12.590
Yeah.

1:19:12.590 --> 1:19:14.633
Yeah, like, stuff like that.

1:19:16.468 --> 1:19:18.596
This Black dude, uh, Quincy Jones,

1:19:18.596 --> 1:19:22.600
he, uh, did the whole score
for the movie, you know.

1:19:22.600 --> 1:19:24.435
Did some other movies too.

1:19:24.435 --> 1:19:27.938
Like a composer.

1:19:27.938 --> 1:19:30.274
Yeah. Yeah.

1:19:32.359 --> 1:19:34.111
PS, I know who Quincy Jones is.

1:19:35.237 --> 1:19:36.864
You should be in some art school.

1:19:37.781 --> 1:19:39.283
You could go to Juilliard.

1:19:39.283 --> 1:19:41.160
I can help you figure out what it takes.

1:19:42.369 --> 1:19:43.370
No.

1:19:43.370 --> 1:19:46.206
Kids trying to get in there
have been training for years.

1:19:46.206 --> 1:19:47.791
Well, where'd Quincy Jones go?

1:19:51.545 --> 1:19:52.880
He didn't go to school.

1:20:13.233 --> 1:20:14.568
I want to see you again.

1:20:17.905 --> 1:20:19.740
I should be honest with you. Um...

1:20:21.075 --> 1:20:23.118
I'm moving in a couple weeks.

1:20:23.744 --> 1:20:25.245
To my uncle's in Florida.

1:20:26.789 --> 1:20:29.416
This white guy
was trying to help us save the house,

1:20:29.416 --> 1:20:31.168
but took the deed or something.

1:20:33.629 --> 1:20:35.172
But we can keep in touch, though.

1:20:36.757 --> 1:20:38.259
I'm gonna miss Harlem.

1:20:42.137 --> 1:20:43.138
<i>What's her name?</i>

1:20:43.138 --> 1:20:44.932
I don't know what you talking 'bout.

1:20:46.016 --> 1:20:48.269
So who's the girl
I saw you hanging out with?

1:20:48.269 --> 1:20:49.770
Just a girl, Ma.

1:20:49.770 --> 1:20:51.397
Well, is she your girlfriend?

1:20:51.397 --> 1:20:56.110
Come on.
You know I like Spanish girls, Ma.

1:20:57.319 --> 1:20:58.320
Pardon me?

1:20:59.071 --> 1:21:02.074
What, she look too much like you
for you to take seriously?

1:21:04.243 --> 1:21:05.369
You know what, little boy?

1:21:05.369 --> 1:21:08.622
I love you. I really do.

1:21:09.540 --> 1:21:11.542
But I'm starting not to like you anymore.

1:21:29.059 --> 1:21:30.853
Now, what's this all about?

1:21:30.853 --> 1:21:33.564
Showing up late, not handing in your work.

1:21:33.564 --> 1:21:35.024
Something's on your mind.

1:21:37.610 --> 1:21:39.403
I said I'm fine.

1:21:39.403 --> 1:21:41.947
What's going on with college?
You make a decision yet?

1:21:45.492 --> 1:21:46.493
Daryl?

1:21:50.831 --> 1:21:52.875
- Not yet.
- And why's that?

1:21:52.875 --> 1:21:54.668
You discuss it with your mother?

1:21:56.545 --> 1:21:57.588
Yeah.

1:21:58.631 --> 1:21:59.632
A little.

1:22:04.345 --> 1:22:06.597
You know this is a safe place.

1:22:12.686 --> 1:22:15.189
How have things been at home
since your father got worse?

1:22:19.276 --> 1:22:23.322
They, uh... They don't think
he's gonna come home.

1:22:26.867 --> 1:22:28.535
I'm sorry to hear that.

1:22:33.040 --> 1:22:37.378
I think the landlord's trying
to push us out or something.

1:22:43.550 --> 1:22:45.886
Do you wanna come work
with me at CCA?

1:22:47.554 --> 1:22:49.223
I run the after-school program.

1:22:50.891 --> 1:22:52.559
Part-time, a few hours.

1:22:54.895 --> 1:22:56.188
How much it pay?

1:22:56.188 --> 1:22:57.773
Enough to help.

1:22:58.983 --> 1:23:02.319
You do good, we'll work
on something better this summer.

1:23:03.612 --> 1:23:06.115
I don't need working papers from you
since you're turning 18 soon.

1:23:06.115 --> 1:23:09.285
Just ask your mother for
your birth certificate and Social, okay?

1:23:19.128 --> 1:23:20.462
Um...

1:23:21.213 --> 1:23:23.257
Thank you, Ms. Tucker.

1:23:23.257 --> 1:23:25.009
I'm happy to help.

1:23:30.264 --> 1:23:31.265
Yo, Ma!

1:24:26.987 --> 1:24:29.365
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey.

1:24:30.074 --> 1:24:31.241
Okay, breathe.

1:24:34.411 --> 1:24:35.955
Okay, okay. Okay.

1:24:38.165 --> 1:24:40.167
Maybe you should try
and eat some food.

1:24:41.877 --> 1:24:42.920
Yeah?

1:24:42.920 --> 1:24:44.713
- I'm not hungry.
- Okay.

1:24:56.767 --> 1:24:58.185
Why do you love me?

1:25:00.145 --> 1:25:02.231
The same reason everybody does.

1:25:05.526 --> 1:25:06.986
That's not an answer.

1:25:10.823 --> 1:25:12.283
I wanna know why.

1:25:13.993 --> 1:25:15.202
You should, um...

1:25:16.537 --> 1:25:19.123
You should probably stop talking
and get some rest, okay?

1:25:27.214 --> 1:25:29.717
I never really knew where it came from.

1:25:34.847 --> 1:25:36.140
Or whether or not...

1:25:42.271 --> 1:25:44.189
whether or not I deserved it.

1:25:48.736 --> 1:25:50.571
Maybe that's why I never...

1:25:53.741 --> 1:25:55.868
I never fully gave it back.

1:25:58.746 --> 1:26:00.039
Now I wonder...

1:26:02.625 --> 1:26:04.418
I wonder if it's too late.

1:26:07.755 --> 1:26:10.174
Damaged people
don't know how to love each other.

1:26:11.842 --> 1:26:12.843
That's all.

1:26:54.218 --> 1:26:55.386
T, sit down.

1:26:56.804 --> 1:26:59.014
I need to talk to you
about a few things.

1:27:13.654 --> 1:27:14.947
Um...

1:27:16.282 --> 1:27:19.285
Before Lucky got sick, we wanted to
have a conversation with you about...

1:27:19.285 --> 1:27:20.911
I don't wanna talk to you about Lucky.

1:27:20.911 --> 1:27:22.037
It's not about him.

1:27:22.037 --> 1:27:24.456
Yo, I don't wanna talk to you
about anything!

1:27:25.958 --> 1:27:26.959
Yeah?

1:27:28.085 --> 1:27:31.839
Only thing I ever wanted more
than a mother was a fucking father!

1:27:38.304 --> 1:27:39.388
Maybe...

1:27:41.849 --> 1:27:44.268
Maybe if you--
if you weren't so hard on him,

1:27:44.268 --> 1:27:45.936
walking around here
so miserable all the time,

1:27:45.936 --> 1:27:47.688
he'd still fucking be here!

1:27:50.608 --> 1:27:51.734
Hmm.

1:28:00.367 --> 1:28:01.660
You don't mean that.

1:28:23.766 --> 1:28:27.269

1:28:48.040 --> 1:28:49.041
Yo, Ma.

1:28:50.334 --> 1:28:52.544
- Ma.
- What?

1:28:53.462 --> 1:28:56.340
This lady over there,
she keep looking over here.

1:28:56.340 --> 1:28:57.508
Who is that?

1:29:00.803 --> 1:29:03.055
That's Lucky's daughter
and her mother.

1:29:05.891 --> 1:29:07.434
Make 'em a plate.

1:29:08.769 --> 1:29:09.770
She's what?

1:29:11.105 --> 1:29:12.439
We'll talk about it later.

1:29:49.184 --> 1:29:50.269
Fuck!

1:29:53.314 --> 1:29:55.524
- Terry!
- Ma, what happened?

1:29:55.524 --> 1:29:56.900
Come move this stuff!

1:29:58.235 --> 1:30:00.112
One of the pipes!

1:30:00.112 --> 1:30:01.196
I-- I got it!

1:30:01.989 --> 1:30:04.033
Ma! Yo.

1:30:04.033 --> 1:30:05.326
Come on, come on.

1:30:21.842 --> 1:30:22.843
Sweetheart.

1:30:25.512 --> 1:30:27.014
You seen Javier?

1:30:27.014 --> 1:30:29.224
- Who?
- The super.

1:30:29.224 --> 1:30:31.435
Oh, um, not since yesterday.

1:30:32.186 --> 1:30:33.187
Sorry.

1:30:44.198 --> 1:30:46.075
Daryl, we need to talk.

1:30:46.075 --> 1:30:47.701
Your paperwork was denied.

1:30:49.119 --> 1:30:50.287
What?

1:30:50.287 --> 1:30:53.290
The Social Security number
you gave me isn't valid.

1:30:53.290 --> 1:30:55.459
I'm glad I caught it
before somebody else did.

1:30:55.459 --> 1:30:58.671
Yeah-- I-- I forgot. It-- It expired.

1:30:59.463 --> 1:31:01.048
That's not how it works.

1:31:01.882 --> 1:31:06.136
So, then wh--
That mean, like, I don't get the job or...

1:31:06.136 --> 1:31:08.305
Well, before I can even look
into any of that,

1:31:08.305 --> 1:31:11.600
we need to sort out
how you ended up with phony papers.

1:31:12.184 --> 1:31:13.811
Did you really ask your mom?

1:31:17.231 --> 1:31:19.316
She don't-- She don't have 'em.

1:31:20.567 --> 1:31:21.860
You're from here, right?

1:31:23.237 --> 1:31:25.739
- What you mean?
- Born in the States.

1:31:26.782 --> 1:31:29.952
Yea-- Yeah. Nah, yeah, yeah.

1:31:30.744 --> 1:31:34.123
Well...
...this could mean a lot of hell for you.

1:31:34.123 --> 1:31:36.292
To get a job, to do anything.

1:31:36.292 --> 1:31:39.461
I mean, it's still probably, you know,
like, with the city.

1:31:40.254 --> 1:31:42.590
From when I was in foster care.

1:31:45.009 --> 1:31:46.093
Huh.

1:31:50.139 --> 1:31:52.975
Oh, I have a friend
down in Social Services who can help.

1:31:52.975 --> 1:31:55.019
No, no, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool.

1:31:55.019 --> 1:31:57.021
It's all good. It's all good.
We just-- It's all good.

1:31:57.021 --> 1:31:58.856
Hey, Janice.

1:31:59.773 --> 1:32:02.318
Listen, I need a favor.
I have a student here whose paperwork is...

1:32:02.318 --> 1:32:04.945
Hey, no, no.
Hey, yo, yo, Ms. Tucker, come on!

1:32:07.781 --> 1:32:09.408
It's all-- It's all good.

1:32:12.286 --> 1:32:13.454
Um...

1:32:15.414 --> 1:32:18.208
They-- They don't--
They don't know I'm with my mother.

1:32:18.208 --> 1:32:19.501
- You know?
- And why is that?

1:32:19.501 --> 1:32:21.170
Who are you supposed to be with?

1:32:22.671 --> 1:32:25.049
- Um...
- Have you told anyone else about this?

1:32:27.134 --> 1:32:29.803
- Nah.
- Is Daryl your real name?

1:32:31.972 --> 1:32:34.642
If you lied on your college applications,
it's a felony.

1:32:34.642 --> 1:32:35.893
It's Terry!

1:32:43.484 --> 1:32:45.778
It's-- It's Terry Wallace.

1:32:50.824 --> 1:32:52.534
How long ago did this happen?

1:32:56.455 --> 1:32:58.123
When-- When I was little.

1:33:00.000 --> 1:33:01.961
I was a social worker for years.

1:33:02.670 --> 1:33:06.382
If the city didn't want to give you back,
it's likely because something happened.

1:33:06.382 --> 1:33:09.551
Regardless of what,
you are still a ward of the state.

1:33:09.551 --> 1:33:11.428
By law, I have to report this.

1:33:11.428 --> 1:33:14.265
No. Do any of that even matter, though?

1:33:14.265 --> 1:33:16.892
You know, I'm finna be 18
in a few weeks, you know, so...

1:33:16.892 --> 1:33:18.143
I can't keep this to myself.

1:33:19.144 --> 1:33:20.729
I have to speak with your mother.

1:33:33.409 --> 1:33:36.370
- Can I talk to you?
- It'd be nicer if you could help.

1:33:37.663 --> 1:33:39.873
- What happened?
- What does it look like, Terry?

1:33:40.833 --> 1:33:43.002
Called the super ten times
since yesterday.

1:33:44.378 --> 1:33:45.921
It's about the job with Ms. Tucker.

1:33:45.921 --> 1:33:49.758
She, um-- She want
my birth certificate and my Social.

1:33:49.758 --> 1:33:51.594
The real ones.

1:33:51.594 --> 1:33:53.053
What do you mean, the real one?

1:33:53.053 --> 1:33:55.264
The papers I found in your room,
they didn't work--

1:33:55.264 --> 1:33:57.558
What do you mean, the papers you found
in my room? You went through my stuff?

1:33:57.558 --> 1:33:59.893
- Why wouldn't you ask me?
- I didn't know I had to!

1:34:01.687 --> 1:34:05.024
She want to come by tomorrow evening
and talk to you.

1:34:05.024 --> 1:34:06.108
For what?

1:34:06.108 --> 1:34:08.944
Well, I mean, I don't know.
What was I supposed to say?

1:34:16.035 --> 1:34:18.412
I don't know how the hell
we gonna get ahold of those.

1:34:24.460 --> 1:34:25.878
Come with me outside. I...

1:34:27.379 --> 1:34:28.505
I need to smoke.

1:34:29.590 --> 1:34:31.508
Starting to smell in here.

1:34:44.772 --> 1:34:46.148
You wanted to leave me.

1:34:49.068 --> 1:34:50.069
No.

1:34:51.695 --> 1:34:52.780
No, Ma.

1:34:53.697 --> 1:34:55.449
Why would you say something like that?

1:34:57.910 --> 1:34:58.911
Forget it.

1:35:03.832 --> 1:35:05.960
What time
your teacher coming tomorrow?

1:35:05.960 --> 1:35:08.963
- Around 6:00 or something. I think.

1:35:17.137 --> 1:35:18.180
T, you should probably see

1:35:18.180 --> 1:35:21.767
if you can stay with Pea
and Miss Annie a little while,

1:35:21.767 --> 1:35:24.061
till they finish working on the apartment.

1:35:29.316 --> 1:35:30.526
Where you gonna go?

1:35:33.320 --> 1:35:34.321
I'll figure it out.

1:35:37.157 --> 1:35:38.993
I'll go to your school tomorrow

1:35:39.618 --> 1:35:43.330
and get everything straightened out
with Ms. What's-Her-Face.

1:36:02.474 --> 1:36:03.559
Yo, Ma.

1:36:14.695 --> 1:36:17.031
Yo, hey, Titi. What's up?

1:36:17.865 --> 1:36:19.408
Um...

1:36:19.408 --> 1:36:21.952
Yeah, you-- you heard from my mother yet?

1:36:24.913 --> 1:36:29.710
Nah, I been--
I been trying to call her all morning.

1:36:29.710 --> 1:36:31.253
No, she, um...

1:36:32.338 --> 1:36:33.505
Yeah, just, um...

1:36:35.674 --> 1:36:38.385
Yeah, just give me a call back
when you-- when you do.

1:36:46.060 --> 1:36:47.937
Hey, y-yeah.

1:36:47.937 --> 1:36:50.189
Yeah, Aunt Kim. Hold on. Let me...

1:36:51.023 --> 1:36:53.150
Hey, no, let, uh--
let me give you a call back.

1:36:57.696 --> 1:37:00.616
Hi, Terrance. Is your mother home?

1:37:01.408 --> 1:37:02.534
Um...

1:37:03.410 --> 1:37:04.578
N-- No.

1:37:05.496 --> 1:37:06.872
She left for work already?

1:37:08.248 --> 1:37:11.418
Yeah, um, I think so.

1:37:14.338 --> 1:37:17.216
Do you mind if we come in
and talk for a bit?

1:37:18.133 --> 1:37:19.176
Uh...

1:37:20.094 --> 1:37:22.596
Yeah. I mean, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.

1:37:23.222 --> 1:37:24.556
Thank you.

1:37:25.432 --> 1:37:27.643
- This is Anne.
- Hey.

1:37:27.643 --> 1:37:31.063
And this is Officer Philips.
Officer Russo.

1:37:31.939 --> 1:37:33.190
May we have a seat?

1:37:34.650 --> 1:37:36.568
How long ago did she leave?

1:37:38.529 --> 1:37:39.780
Yesterday evening.

1:37:40.406 --> 1:37:42.866
What was the last thing
she said to you?

1:37:42.866 --> 1:37:45.202
Did she say anything
out of the ordinary?

1:37:45.202 --> 1:37:47.121
Anything unusual?

1:37:47.621 --> 1:37:51.292
Well... not that I remember.

1:37:52.126 --> 1:37:53.877
Everything seemed fine.

1:37:53.877 --> 1:37:55.337
Excuse me, sir, could you--
could you--

1:37:55.337 --> 1:37:58.215
could y'all, you know,
not go through all our stuff?

1:37:58.215 --> 1:38:00.884
Terrance, we really need
your cooperation on this.

1:38:00.884 --> 1:38:03.220
Uh, she, like, gonna get in trouble
or something?

1:38:03.220 --> 1:38:06.223
You know, 'cause, I mean,
you know, why does it even matter?

1:38:06.223 --> 1:38:08.809
I mean, you know,
I'm almost 18, you know, so.

1:38:10.477 --> 1:38:11.687
Um...

1:38:12.438 --> 1:38:13.606
Well, about that.

1:38:15.441 --> 1:38:18.819
It's difficult for me to say
what I have to say right now.

1:38:21.989 --> 1:38:22.990
Inez...

1:38:24.450 --> 1:38:26.160
is not your biological mother.

1:38:30.748 --> 1:38:31.790
N--

1:38:32.666 --> 1:38:34.501
Like some joke or something?

1:38:34.501 --> 1:38:35.836
No, it's not.

1:38:43.093 --> 1:38:45.054
This is the woman who abducted you.

1:38:47.932 --> 1:38:51.018
Whatever story she told you
was just a lie that she cooked up.

1:38:53.187 --> 1:38:55.898
I am so sorry
you have to find out like this.

1:38:55.898 --> 1:38:58.108
Are you sure
you don't know where she is?

1:38:58.108 --> 1:38:59.360
Any ideas at all?

1:39:01.278 --> 1:39:02.905
Give him some room, please.

1:39:05.032 --> 1:39:09.119
For now, we need to focus on
what's best for Terry moving forward.

1:39:09.119 --> 1:39:10.788
What's best for me?

1:39:10.788 --> 1:39:13.332
He doesn't have any known relatives
that we can trust.

1:39:13.332 --> 1:39:14.959
That's all right.

1:39:14.959 --> 1:39:17.503
We can place him at Sheltering Arms
for the time being.

1:39:18.629 --> 1:39:20.798
It's a family services program. It's...

1:39:20.798 --> 1:39:22.091
I know what it is.

1:39:22.091 --> 1:39:25.928
Just for a couple of weeks,
until we can navigate next steps.

1:39:29.682 --> 1:39:31.433
If that's all right with you.

1:39:33.477 --> 1:39:35.980
I don't know if your parents
are still on the street,

1:39:35.980 --> 1:39:37.731
but we can work on that.

1:39:39.650 --> 1:39:41.610
Everything was such a mess back then.

1:39:43.737 --> 1:39:46.407
In my office, the only record
you had on some kids was...

1:39:48.242 --> 1:39:49.743
just an index card.

1:39:57.251 --> 1:39:58.377
Hello?

1:39:59.253 --> 1:40:00.963
- Terry, is that you?

1:40:00.963 --> 1:40:03.632
<i>Yeah. Y-- Titi--</i>

1:40:04.758 --> 1:40:08.304
I stopped by the group home, but
nobody seems to know where you are.

1:40:08.304 --> 1:40:09.888
<i>I'm at-- I'm at a pay phone.</i>

1:40:09.888 --> 1:40:12.349
<i>I can't stay there.</i>

1:40:12.349 --> 1:40:13.934
You want to meet me back here?

1:40:15.019 --> 1:40:17.354
<i>I want you to come stay with me.</i>

1:40:17.354 --> 1:40:19.523
- Yeah.
-<i>Okay.</i>

1:40:19.523 --> 1:40:22.151
<i>I think you should
stop by the house first,</i>

1:40:22.151 --> 1:40:24.903
pick up any last things
you might want to take with you.

1:40:27.281 --> 1:40:28.699
Yeah.

1:40:28.699 --> 1:40:31.243
-<i>I'll see you soon, baby.</i>
- Okay.

1:40:33.621 --> 1:40:34.747
Okay.

1:41:09.323 --> 1:41:11.992
- Ma?
- Hey, Terry.

1:41:17.289 --> 1:41:18.874
What you-- What you doing?

1:41:20.000 --> 1:41:21.335
I left some things.

1:41:22.169 --> 1:41:24.213
Look, don't stand over there
looking over me.

1:41:24.213 --> 1:41:27.466
I'm sure they already got to you,
so feel free to run along.

1:41:31.428 --> 1:41:32.763
Can we talk, though?

1:41:33.514 --> 1:41:34.682
Talk about what?

1:41:35.808 --> 1:41:37.101
You serious right now?

1:41:40.187 --> 1:41:42.690
Fine. You want to talk, let's talk.

1:41:52.032 --> 1:41:53.534
Fetch me my Newports.

1:41:55.494 --> 1:41:57.830
- You was just over there...
- Over on the stand.

1:42:11.844 --> 1:42:13.178
What you want me to say?

1:42:13.846 --> 1:42:15.639
That I fucked up?

1:42:15.639 --> 1:42:17.474
Yeah, T, I fucked up.

1:42:17.474 --> 1:42:18.809
But life goes on. So what?

1:42:18.809 --> 1:42:20.394
Well, as long as it's your call, right?

1:42:20.394 --> 1:42:22.521
Who was the one who made the choice,
standing in that hospital?

1:42:22.521 --> 1:42:24.273
- Was it you or me?
- Thinking you was my fucking mother!

1:42:24.273 --> 1:42:25.691
Lower your fucking tone!

1:42:26.567 --> 1:42:29.069
You better watch
how the fuck you talking to me.

1:42:31.405 --> 1:42:32.406
Did Lucky know?

1:42:37.911 --> 1:42:39.496
Yes, he knew.

1:42:41.415 --> 1:42:43.667
He didn't agree with it, but he knew.

1:42:44.835 --> 1:42:46.920
Why? Why you do it?

1:42:52.760 --> 1:42:54.470
I don't know why I did it, T.

1:42:54.470 --> 1:42:57.181
It was something small
that turned into something else.

1:42:57.181 --> 1:42:59.099
And that's supposed
to make it right or something?

1:42:59.099 --> 1:43:01.101
Who made you the chief
of right or wrong?

1:43:02.311 --> 1:43:04.229
You don't think I have feelings too?

1:43:04.229 --> 1:43:07.775
After all those years I took care of you,
who the fuck was there to take care of me?

1:43:07.775 --> 1:43:10.694
I stood up for everybody else!
What the fuck was it for?

1:43:11.779 --> 1:43:13.364
Every chance you had,

1:43:13.364 --> 1:43:15.991
every chance you had,
you turned your back on me!

1:43:15.991 --> 1:43:17.952
- That's not true.
- Oh, please.

1:43:17.952 --> 1:43:20.454
Nobody else give a shit about Black women
except for other Black women,

1:43:20.454 --> 1:43:22.456
and even that shit get messy.

1:43:29.296 --> 1:43:31.298
Who heard me when I was hurt?

1:43:33.968 --> 1:43:35.135
It wasn't you.

1:43:35.970 --> 1:43:37.554
And it damn sure wasn't Lucky.

1:43:37.554 --> 1:43:39.223
But you were my mother!

1:43:40.849 --> 1:43:44.144
Mmm? Now, how am I supposed to feel?

1:44:02.913 --> 1:44:05.332
I need to know what was real.

1:44:20.514 --> 1:44:22.683
I never left you on that corner.

1:44:26.020 --> 1:44:27.730
I was the one that found you.

1:44:32.359 --> 1:44:36.363
Little two-year-old
running around outside the shelter.

1:44:40.034 --> 1:44:43.787
I waited outside on that block
for hours with you.

1:44:45.956 --> 1:44:48.626
Waiting for anybody to show up.

1:44:50.878 --> 1:44:53.422
I saw so much of myself.

1:44:56.383 --> 1:44:59.553
I just... I just wanted
to look out for you.

1:45:01.972 --> 1:45:04.308
I didn't want you getting chewed out
like I was.

1:45:06.018 --> 1:45:09.146
I seen somebody who needed me.

1:45:09.146 --> 1:45:10.314
But...

1:45:11.357 --> 1:45:13.901
But maybe I'm the one who needed you.

1:45:15.027 --> 1:45:16.862
And, T, for that, I'm sorry.

1:45:18.739 --> 1:45:20.699
I'm... I'm sorry.

1:45:25.579 --> 1:45:27.081
I tried to change.

1:45:30.000 --> 1:45:33.253
But I don't-- I don't want it.
I don't want this.

1:45:34.922 --> 1:45:38.384
Not if... Not if it's built on a lie.

1:45:40.094 --> 1:45:44.431
Not if being loved by you or anybody else
means not loving myself.

1:45:47.142 --> 1:45:49.478
They not gonna let you get away with it.

1:45:49.478 --> 1:45:50.771
I ain't going to jail.

1:45:51.480 --> 1:45:54.066
I already know what the fuck
they gonna say anyway.

1:45:54.066 --> 1:45:55.693
Already know. And guess what?

1:45:55.693 --> 1:45:57.736
I don't give a fuck.

1:45:57.736 --> 1:45:59.321
Because I still won.

1:46:00.781 --> 1:46:02.032
I won.

1:46:03.075 --> 1:46:05.786
Because I know you gonna grow up
to be somebody.

1:46:10.416 --> 1:46:13.085
I wish I didn't know.

1:46:16.046 --> 1:46:19.717
I wish-- I wish you could've did a better
job of keeping that lie to yourself.

1:46:20.634 --> 1:46:24.013
I wish it could've continued
so that we could've continued, and I...

1:46:27.683 --> 1:46:29.560
I wish I knew how to be better to you

1:46:29.560 --> 1:46:32.229
so you didn't feel like
you had to leave me alone.

1:46:36.066 --> 1:46:37.484
'Cause I'm scared.

1:46:41.071 --> 1:46:43.741
I'm scared
that I won't have no home no more.

1:46:45.117 --> 1:46:46.577
And one day I'm gonna show up,

1:46:46.577 --> 1:46:49.246
and it's gonna feel like
we ain't never happened.

1:46:51.081 --> 1:46:52.499
Ma!

1:46:53.417 --> 1:46:55.461
Like this wasn't our living room?

1:46:57.087 --> 1:46:58.255
Our home?

1:47:02.676 --> 1:47:04.678
I miss my bed, Ma.

1:47:09.683 --> 1:47:11.685
The one that you made for me.

1:47:21.195 --> 1:47:22.905
Where's home for me now?

1:49:38.248 --> 1:49:39.833
This isn't goodbye.

1:49:41.835 --> 1:49:45.172
I promise. This isn't goodbye, T.

1:49:47.007 --> 1:49:48.175
I promise.

1:49:54.848 --> 1:49:56.100
I love you, Ma.

1:50:00.020 --> 1:50:01.230
I love you.

1:50:06.277 --> 1:50:07.736
I think you should go.

1:51:07.922 --> 1:51:10.716
Okay, miss. Where to?
