WEBVTT

00:02.070 --> 00:05.439
WOMAN: Paul's been having
a difficult time of late.

00:12.012 --> 00:14.648
FX presents Baskets.

00:14.682 --> 00:16.750
MAN: Get on with it!

00:20.554 --> 00:23.357
Oh. "Hymn Worksheet."

00:23.391 --> 00:25.359
Christine, I can't wait to see
what comes out of your mind.

00:25.393 --> 00:27.395
Dale cancelled
the French clowns?

00:27.428 --> 00:29.530
Dale said we were going
over budget.

00:29.563 --> 00:31.699
Mom, $500 per firework?

00:32.800 --> 00:33.867
Ah!

00:33.901 --> 00:37.338
Oh! Mother!

00:37.371 --> 00:39.173
Yes, hello, my name
is Dale Baskets.

00:39.207 --> 00:41.175
I'd like to sue someone, please.

00:41.209 --> 00:42.610
Yes, I can hold.

00:44.945 --> 00:46.947
MAN: You know, maybe
you can clean this bus up

00:46.980 --> 00:48.949
a little bit next time.

00:48.982 --> 00:50.618
All right.

00:50.651 --> 00:52.386
Hey, ma'am. Uh, sir.

00:52.420 --> 00:55.523
Ma'am, do you know where, uh,
Shitty Grove Terrace is?

00:55.556 --> 00:57.291
WOMAN:
Yeah. It's two blocks up.

00:57.325 --> 00:59.393
MAN: Yeah. Okay. All right.
That's good.

00:59.427 --> 01:02.230
Okay. I'm proceeding
with caution.

01:02.263 --> 01:03.864
Where'd those birds go?

01:03.897 --> 01:05.433
Oh, my, look at that.

01:05.466 --> 01:07.568
Wow, if I had my camera
right now.

01:07.601 --> 01:09.303
Oh, those people
must've moved out.

01:09.337 --> 01:11.205
All right.

01:11.239 --> 01:12.706
No kidding.

01:12.740 --> 01:14.074
Oh, roadkill.

01:14.108 --> 01:17.445
This is a funky neighborhood.

01:19.113 --> 01:20.948
-Hi.

01:20.981 --> 01:23.784
-Good. -Um, I have
a special delivery for you

01:23.817 --> 01:26.120
and that's if you are,

01:26.154 --> 01:30.991
uh, Christine... Basket.

01:31.024 --> 01:32.593
Baskets.

01:32.626 --> 01:33.961
-Baskets.
-Yes.

01:33.994 --> 01:35.429
That's-that's a tongue twister.

01:35.463 --> 01:38.599
Um, I-I was supposed
to bring this yesterday,

01:38.632 --> 01:41.302
and I know it's Thursday,
it's Thanksgiving.

01:41.335 --> 01:43.471
I don't celebrate holidays--
I don't know about you--

01:43.504 --> 01:45.473
but this is for you.

01:45.506 --> 01:47.941
-Okay, thank you.

01:47.975 --> 01:50.478
-Thank you very much. -Please,
ma'am, uh, if-- I was hoping

01:50.511 --> 01:53.414
I could borrow, I was hoping
I could borrow a glass of water.

01:53.447 --> 01:55.583
I... my water bottle
on the bus rolled

01:55.616 --> 01:57.451
under this big, scary menace.

02:00.388 --> 02:01.822
Ooh. Ooh, my God.

02:01.855 --> 02:03.657
That's a huge turkey. Wow.

02:03.691 --> 02:06.360
Boy, you're gonna cook that
all by yourself, huh? Oh, man.

02:06.394 --> 02:08.296
I bet you know how to do that.
That's good.

02:08.329 --> 02:11.499
: Anyway, um, I wonder
what that turkey was thinking

02:11.532 --> 02:14.935
right before the guys at
the farm chopped his head off.

02:14.968 --> 02:19.307
Oh. Oh, my gosh,
you're getting sued.

02:19.340 --> 02:21.309
I didn't open the envelope.

02:21.342 --> 02:23.043
I didn't open it.

02:23.076 --> 02:26.380
Perhaps, glanced a little
when they were putting it in

02:26.414 --> 02:28.148
at the place
and I just saw that...

02:28.182 --> 02:30.117
I'm... I better go.

02:30.150 --> 02:32.720
I'm-- that sucks.

02:32.753 --> 02:34.888
Thanks for the water.

02:40.828 --> 02:43.331
Are we gonna do anything for,
uh, Thanksgiving this year

02:43.364 --> 02:45.233
or should we just skip it?

02:45.266 --> 02:47.801
I thought we would eat at 3:00.

02:47.835 --> 02:49.036
Well, I have plans.

02:49.069 --> 02:50.304
Oh, you do, do you?

02:50.338 --> 02:51.905
-Yeah, I'm going to Martha's.
-Hmm.

02:51.939 --> 02:53.474
She's a fan of my clowning,

02:53.507 --> 02:55.075
so I think it's better
to go where I'm wanted.

02:55.108 --> 02:56.877
But Eddie's gonna be here,
right?

02:56.910 --> 02:59.547
No, he's going rock climbing
with his sponsor in Yosemite.

02:59.580 --> 03:01.515
Okay. See you, Mom.

03:01.549 --> 03:04.318
Bye.

03:04.352 --> 03:06.153
Say hi to Martha for me.

03:06.186 --> 03:07.221
KEN:
Hey, Christine.

03:07.255 --> 03:08.656
Can you pass the salt?

03:08.689 --> 03:10.591
-I sure can.

03:10.624 --> 03:12.893
I got a salt right here for you.

03:12.926 --> 03:17.265
Here, let me let you have a bite
of this stuffing that Ivy made.

03:17.298 --> 03:19.900
Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.

03:19.933 --> 03:21.435
-Oh.

03:21.469 --> 03:22.603
Wow, what's in that?

03:22.636 --> 03:23.904
Is that a little basil?

03:23.937 --> 03:25.506
KEN:
A little bit of everything.

03:25.539 --> 03:28.175
Oh, it was delicious
and no calories.

03:29.943 --> 03:32.446
-You know,
you should have come out.

03:32.480 --> 03:35.115
Oh, when I fly,
I just swell so much.

03:35.148 --> 03:38.519
Is everything good between us?

03:38.552 --> 03:40.854
Oh!
-MONICA: Hi, Christine!

03:40.888 --> 03:42.456
How are you?

03:42.490 --> 03:45.293
Happy Thanksgiving.

03:45.326 --> 03:46.794
-Happy Thanksgiving to you, too.
-Happy Thanksgiving.

03:46.827 --> 03:48.529
Oh, I wish I was there.

03:48.562 --> 03:49.863
IVY:
Where you at?

03:49.897 --> 03:53.066
Oh, I'm in Bakersfield
in my kitchen.

03:53.100 --> 03:55.903
-WOMAN: Hey. -Oh, my gosh.
-Ooh, let me help. Let me help.

03:55.936 --> 03:57.971
-Let me help.

03:58.005 --> 03:59.407
Chris, baby, I'm gonna have
to call you back.

03:59.440 --> 04:00.908
Gina just showed up
with the new baby. Love you.

04:00.941 --> 04:02.576
-Uh, bye.

04:02.610 --> 04:04.412
Oh. Bye.

04:04.445 --> 04:07.047
Hi, Cody.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.949
Hi, Logan.

04:08.982 --> 04:11.084
It's your mother.

04:11.118 --> 04:13.220
Happy Thanksgiving.

04:13.253 --> 04:15.756
I hope you're having
a nice home-cooked meal

04:15.789 --> 04:17.658
with some nice people.

04:17.691 --> 04:22.396
Uh, we miss you,
we love you, and, um,

04:22.430 --> 04:25.466
I can almost smell the turkey
from here.

04:25.499 --> 04:27.167
I hope you're enjoying it.

04:27.200 --> 04:29.370
Happy Thanksgiving, boys.

04:47.521 --> 04:49.523
*

04:58.632 --> 05:01.969
* Dear Lord, it's me

05:02.002 --> 05:04.304
* Can't you see...

05:04.338 --> 05:05.973
No.

05:06.006 --> 05:08.208
* Dear Lord, it's me...

05:08.241 --> 05:10.544
Dear Lord, it's me.

05:10.578 --> 05:12.546
Christine.

05:12.580 --> 05:14.682
* Dear Lord, it's me

05:14.715 --> 05:17.851
* Christine

05:17.885 --> 05:22.990
* I'm really sick
of these times I see... *

05:23.023 --> 05:25.393
No. The...

05:25.426 --> 05:28.396
* I'm really tired

05:28.429 --> 05:31.565
* Of this rodeo

05:31.599 --> 05:34.001
* S-Scene...

05:34.034 --> 05:37.070
Scheme?

05:52.252 --> 05:55.255
W

05:55.288 --> 05:56.724
You got to work
on your greetings.

05:56.757 --> 05:58.158
You invited me,
like, two weeks ago.

05:58.191 --> 06:01.028
Shit.

06:01.061 --> 06:03.030
What about being
with your family?

06:03.063 --> 06:05.365
I work with them.
I need a break.

06:05.399 --> 06:06.767
Thank you.

06:06.800 --> 06:09.437
Um, um, well, I guess come in.

06:11.805 --> 06:13.774
Chip, look, I have
to be honest with you.

06:13.807 --> 06:15.242
You caught my family

06:15.275 --> 06:17.377
in the middle of a squabble
on turkey day.

06:17.411 --> 06:19.246
Should I come back in an hour
or something?

06:19.279 --> 06:20.247
I don't know.

06:20.280 --> 06:21.849
My mom's not cooking.

06:21.882 --> 06:24.685
A-Actually, she's not even
coming out of her room.

06:26.587 --> 06:27.755
MRS. BROOKS:
I told you,

06:27.788 --> 06:30.290
I am not cooking.

06:30.323 --> 06:32.059
Mom, you're out of your room.

06:32.092 --> 06:33.727
You know, I know
you're not cooking.

06:33.761 --> 06:36.063
Chip and I were just gonna
figure it out.

06:36.096 --> 06:38.365
-CHIP: Hi, Mrs. Brooks.

06:38.398 --> 06:39.700
It's Chip. Chip Baskets.

06:39.733 --> 06:42.202
Did she tell you
that my husband thinks

06:42.235 --> 06:44.271
he doesn't need
his pills anymore?

06:44.304 --> 06:45.973
-Mom.
-No.

06:46.006 --> 06:47.608
I don't know how he thinks
he can live.

06:47.641 --> 06:49.477
I've been chopping up
the vitamins

06:49.510 --> 06:52.746
to put on his cinnamon toast
for years.

06:52.780 --> 06:54.648
Mom, Chip doesn't want
to hear this.

06:54.682 --> 06:57.451
No, it's-it's nice to hear
other families arguing

06:57.485 --> 06:58.652
other than my own.

06:58.686 --> 07:00.087
MRS. BROOKS:
Well, I'm done.

07:00.120 --> 07:01.555
Done, done, done.

07:01.589 --> 07:03.256
MARTHA:
Okay, well...

07:03.290 --> 07:04.625
Chip and I will handle it.

07:04.658 --> 07:06.393
We can make the turkey, right?

07:06.426 --> 07:09.329
No turkey. Anything but turkey.

07:09.362 --> 07:11.164
Bye, Mrs. Brooks.

07:11.198 --> 07:12.966
Nice to see you.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.669
Chip, I'm really sorry
about this.

07:15.703 --> 07:17.938
You know, you can leave
if you want to.

07:17.971 --> 07:20.273
This is really embarrassing.

07:20.307 --> 07:22.409
My mom gave me a rodeo, Martha.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.678
I don't think it gets any more
embarrassing than that.

07:24.712 --> 07:26.313
I like your mom.

07:26.346 --> 07:28.315
Well, maybe we should
do a switch,

07:28.348 --> 07:30.283
a little swap
or something like that.

07:30.317 --> 07:33.987
Hey, Mom, would you eat
frozen tilapia?

07:34.021 --> 07:38.191
And there's also some venison
from that deer Dad hit.

07:38.225 --> 07:39.660
I'll have some of that
dead deer meat.

07:39.693 --> 07:41.829
MARTHA:
Oh, okay.

07:41.862 --> 07:44.698
-Well...

07:52.139 --> 07:55.208
Uh... oh!

07:55.242 --> 07:57.511
Oh...

07:57.545 --> 07:59.112
MRS. BASKETS:
Yeah, 911?

07:59.146 --> 08:01.214
Oh, my neck.

08:01.248 --> 08:04.652
Describe 'em? Well,
they're hooligans, I think.

08:04.685 --> 08:06.219
I thought they were gypsies,
but they're

08:06.253 --> 08:08.689
more ruffians than gypsies,
I think.

08:08.722 --> 08:10.357
Uh, there's no,
there's no money.

08:10.390 --> 08:13.493
Nothing to be had here.

08:13.527 --> 08:15.696
The silverware you could have
because it's a bitch to clean.

08:15.729 --> 08:18.899
-We are looking for Chip.

08:18.932 --> 08:22.870
Oh, my son drags every
Tom, Dick and Harry home.

08:22.903 --> 08:26.540
Listen, no ambulance, no police.
All under control.

08:26.574 --> 08:28.676
-Thanks.
-Excuse me.

08:28.709 --> 08:31.178
My-my friend and I
have come to town

08:31.211 --> 08:34.481
to do clowning at
the Baskets rodeo family

08:34.514 --> 08:36.349
-with Chip Baskets.
-Oh.

08:36.383 --> 08:37.651
He called me for the opera.

08:37.685 --> 08:39.920
The French clowns!

08:39.953 --> 08:41.354
-Oh.

08:41.388 --> 08:43.223
I thought you were gypsies.

08:43.256 --> 08:44.558
I'll open the door.

08:44.592 --> 08:47.861
Oh, so relieved. Oh...

08:54.768 --> 08:57.504
Mom, I've got your tilapia.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.106
-MRS. BROOKS: Leave it.
-Mom...

08:59.139 --> 09:00.741
Just leave it.

09:00.774 --> 09:03.476
:
First and 17...

09:10.784 --> 09:12.786
Ugh.

09:12.820 --> 09:14.554
REFEREE :
Illegal use of the hands...

09:14.588 --> 09:15.689
on the offense...

09:15.723 --> 09:17.224
-Green Bay Packers.

09:17.257 --> 09:18.792
-They-they won.

09:18.826 --> 09:21.795
-Uh...

09:21.829 --> 09:24.464
Football team.
Green Bay Packers.

09:24.497 --> 09:26.767
No, I don't, I don't much
follow football anymore.

09:26.800 --> 09:29.369
-I used to follow
the Denver Nuggets, but, yeah...

09:29.402 --> 09:31.071
Really? Huh.

09:31.104 --> 09:34.875
Martha, what is this?
Is this fish or chicken?

09:34.908 --> 09:36.910
I think
I'm gonna take off. -It's...

09:36.944 --> 09:38.879
Oh, okay.
Well, bye, Chip.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.213
-Okay, bye, Chip.
-Bye, Mr. Brooks.

09:40.247 --> 09:41.749
Bye, Martha.

09:41.782 --> 09:43.917
Um, that's tilapia, Dad.
It's fish.

09:43.951 --> 09:46.820
Fish? Huh. Okay.

09:46.854 --> 09:50.624
-It's all right.

09:50.658 --> 09:53.460
Well, happy Thanksgiving.

09:53.493 --> 09:55.829
Yeah, happy Thanksgiving.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.299
Kirkland products coming up.

09:59.332 --> 10:02.102
Mango, tropical mango.

10:02.135 --> 10:06.940
Or would you like organic?
I thought you might be.

10:06.974 --> 10:09.777
How about a--
ooh, tuning the old violin.

10:09.810 --> 10:11.078
How 'bout a drink?

10:11.111 --> 10:13.346
Not too cold,
but best I could do

10:13.380 --> 10:14.782
on a short notice.

10:14.815 --> 10:17.685
-Ah, drinks.

10:17.718 --> 10:21.621
Well, sort of, it's,
you know, got grapes in it.

10:21.655 --> 10:23.791
-Ah-ha.
-CLAUDIA: Ah-ha.

10:23.824 --> 10:25.292
MRS. BASKETS:
Ah-ah.

10:25.325 --> 10:26.827
Ta-da.

10:26.860 --> 10:29.462
My, what is it?

10:29.496 --> 10:30.964
Surprise.

10:30.998 --> 10:32.800
Surprises?
I love 'em.

10:32.833 --> 10:34.367
Oh...

10:36.403 --> 10:39.172
-Oh!

10:39.206 --> 10:42.109
-Tiny burgers!

10:42.142 --> 10:45.112
Thank you so much.

10:45.145 --> 10:46.714
They look like
little sugar burgers.

10:46.747 --> 10:48.348
-They should be in a museum.
-I know. Delicious.

10:48.381 --> 10:50.517
MRS. BASKETS:
So French. Oh...

10:50.550 --> 10:53.854
-CLAUDIA: Mm-hmm.

10:53.887 --> 10:56.456
Oh! I've got a big head.

10:56.489 --> 10:58.491
-Oh, it fits.
-CLAUDIA: Perfect.

10:58.525 --> 11:00.894
-CLAUDIA: Amazing.

11:00.928 --> 11:03.330
Really? Oh. Ah!

11:03.363 --> 11:05.799
I never thought of
doing that with my Kirkland.

11:07.367 --> 11:09.036
MRS. BASKETS: Oh, I feel like
part of your troupe.

11:09.069 --> 11:12.572
So thoughtful of you all.

11:12.605 --> 11:14.574
I really appreciate it.

11:14.607 --> 11:16.877
-Wow, kitty cat.

11:16.910 --> 11:19.679
-Ronald Reagan!

11:19.713 --> 11:21.014
Don't juggle him.

11:21.048 --> 11:23.884
Oh, he likes you all.

11:23.917 --> 11:26.419
Thank you for having us,
Mama Baskets.

11:26.453 --> 11:28.155
-You're welcome.
-We are honored

11:28.188 --> 11:30.023
to be able to perform
for your rodeo.

11:30.057 --> 11:34.161
Rodeo? Oh,
talk about that later.

11:34.194 --> 11:37.664
Oh. Who wants to see
Chip home movies,

11:37.697 --> 11:38.999
when he was a little boy?

11:39.032 --> 11:40.834
-Sure. Yeah, yeah.
-Yeah.

11:40.868 --> 11:42.870
-I'll bring the cookies.

11:48.541 --> 11:49.777
-Oh, he loved to throw things.
-Twins.

11:49.810 --> 11:52.379
-MRS. BASKETS: Twins, yes.
-Ah.

11:52.412 --> 11:54.748
Seems like 100 years ago.

11:54.782 --> 11:57.217
-Or yesterday, I'm not sure.
-I know.

11:57.250 --> 11:59.787
MRS. BASKETS:
Oh, I miss my garden.

11:59.820 --> 12:02.122
Ah, there's Cat Nixon!

12:02.155 --> 12:04.057
I named her after
the president's wife, Pat Nixon.

12:04.091 --> 12:05.392
-Right, the president.
Yeah, yeah. -Uh-huh, yeah.

12:05.425 --> 12:06.894
He was a lovely person.

12:06.927 --> 12:11.031
-Oh, shoot.

12:11.064 --> 12:13.533
MRS. BASKETS:
My mother. She passed away

12:13.566 --> 12:16.536
not too long ago.

12:19.006 --> 12:21.274
*

12:22.509 --> 12:24.945
Hey, Mom.

12:28.982 --> 12:32.519
The first Thanksgiving
without my mother.

12:41.694 --> 12:45.833
-My father.

12:45.866 --> 12:49.269
Always yelling, always
telling us what to do.

12:49.302 --> 12:51.704
Telling my mother
what to do.

13:10.057 --> 13:12.025
He loved to stomp around.

13:17.797 --> 13:20.433
It's a mess in here!
It's a mess!

13:20.467 --> 13:22.335
-I'm sorry, Daddy.

13:22.369 --> 13:24.771
The face.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.940
* Dear Lord,
it's me, Christine... *

13:26.974 --> 13:29.476
Oh, that's, uh,
something I'm working on.

13:29.509 --> 13:31.778
-That's not really finished.
-* I'm so sick of this

13:31.811 --> 13:36.116
-* Rodeo scene

13:36.149 --> 13:40.320
* I'm not job,
never claimed to be... *

13:40.353 --> 13:44.057
Job. It's "Job."
It's a common mistake.

13:44.091 --> 13:49.796
* I'm not Job,
never claimed to be *

13:49.829 --> 13:52.732
* I know you like
to challenge me *

13:52.765 --> 13:57.337
* But this is ridiculous

13:57.370 --> 14:00.340
BOTH:
* Abraham was willing to kill

14:00.373 --> 14:02.675
* His son for thee

14:02.709 --> 14:04.711
* I will kill

14:04.744 --> 14:07.380
* Two of my sons with glee!

14:08.949 --> 14:10.317
-CLAUDIA: Chip!

14:10.350 --> 14:11.584
Chip...

14:11.618 --> 14:12.752
-Hey!
-Hey, hey, hey.

14:12.785 --> 14:15.255
* Tra, la, la, la, la, la...

14:15.288 --> 14:17.557
-CHIP:
How did you guys get here?

14:17.590 --> 14:19.526
-We busked all over the place.
-Oh, well,

14:19.559 --> 14:22.395
-it's so great to see you.
-Like, like train, bicycle,

14:22.429 --> 14:23.663
-I don't know.
-CHIP: Oh, my God, okay.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.098
* La, la, la

14:25.132 --> 14:27.034
Hold on one second.
Hold on one second.

14:27.067 --> 14:28.401
* La, la, la

14:28.435 --> 14:30.537
-* La, la, la, la, la, la
Hey! -Chip, Chip, Chip!

14:37.978 --> 14:40.280
Ah! Wow.

14:40.313 --> 14:41.881
: Oh.

14:41.915 --> 14:45.118
-Good one.
-Just trying to...

14:45.152 --> 14:47.887
join in the revelry
with the clowning.

14:47.921 --> 14:48.956
Really?

14:48.989 --> 14:50.924
: I'm sorry.
I don't want to...

14:50.958 --> 14:52.692
-Oh, dear.
-I'm sorry.

14:52.725 --> 14:55.595
Why are you wearing
this costume?

14:55.628 --> 14:59.967
This is my French clown outfit.
This is... Renoir.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.602
JULIEN:
No, no, no. Chip, Chip.

15:02.635 --> 15:05.238
It's like someone, you know,
looking at a funny

15:05.272 --> 15:08.775
French copy of something
he saw in a photo

15:08.808 --> 15:10.643
on Google image search.

15:10.677 --> 15:13.146
It is offensive to me.

15:13.180 --> 15:16.316
It is offensive and also it-it's
offensive to my mother,

15:16.349 --> 15:19.086
you know, i-it's offensive
to her mother, you know.

15:19.119 --> 15:21.288
To his mother, you know,
her mother, their mothers.

15:21.321 --> 15:22.755
I mean, it's... in a way,

15:22.789 --> 15:25.558
it is offensive to
all the French mothers.

15:25.592 --> 15:28.061
And, uh, I think

15:28.095 --> 15:29.596
it's not about
the French mother...

15:29.629 --> 15:31.231
I-I don't know what...

15:31.264 --> 15:32.765
Come on, guys, I mean,
what do you...

15:32.799 --> 15:35.935
You see, they're offended,
like if somebody came here

15:35.969 --> 15:39.172
and tried to do
some Bakersfield thing.

15:39.206 --> 15:41.441
You know, like the
Bakersfield shuffle.

15:41.474 --> 15:43.343
Yeah, if I did
a Bakersfield shuffle,

15:43.376 --> 15:44.644
that would be offensive.

15:44.677 --> 15:46.079
MRS. BASKETS:
Yes. And...

15:46.113 --> 15:48.815
he probably couldn't even do it
'cause it's not easy.

15:48.848 --> 15:49.983
CLAUDIA:
Mm-hmm.

15:50.017 --> 15:51.584
You're not a French cloon.

15:51.618 --> 15:53.020
-Yeah.

15:53.053 --> 15:57.190
But, you know, be proud 'cause
you're a Bakersfield cloon.

15:57.224 --> 15:59.759
-JULIEN: That's right.
-Be proud of it.

15:59.792 --> 16:03.096
-Yeah, be proud of that. -Yeah.

16:03.130 --> 16:05.465
Clown.
-I love that. -Very French.

16:05.498 --> 16:08.801
-I wish I can be a Bakersfield
cloon. -Yeah, me, too.

16:08.835 --> 16:10.503
-I mean...
-JULIEN: Yeah, I would.

16:10.537 --> 16:13.540
I mean, that would be offensive
to him and to his mother.

16:13.573 --> 16:15.675
Thank you.

16:15.708 --> 16:19.846
Okay, Chip, maybe, you know,
maybe Renoir must die.

16:19.879 --> 16:21.114
Yeah.

16:21.148 --> 16:22.782
What?

16:22.815 --> 16:26.019
Renoir must just die. That's it.

16:26.053 --> 16:27.487
CLAUDIA:
Yeah, die.

16:30.823 --> 16:32.825
*

16:57.184 --> 16:58.585
All right,
we're gonna start the tour

16:58.618 --> 17:00.187
because this is just
the tip of the iceberg.

17:00.220 --> 17:03.156
We got two turkeys.
We got two chickens right here.

17:03.190 --> 17:05.192
Here are the chicken--
oh, they've...

17:05.225 --> 17:07.060
Hey, I've got
a confession to make.

17:07.094 --> 17:10.163
I'm not running
the rodeo anymore.

17:10.197 --> 17:14.401
So, talk to Chip if you want
to know about the rodeo.

17:14.434 --> 17:16.836
Um... Dale has kind of, um,

17:16.869 --> 17:21.574
frozen the-the, uh,
clowning budget at this time.

17:21.608 --> 17:23.676
I'm really sorry, you guys.

17:23.710 --> 17:26.513
-MRS. BASKETS: Me, too.
-Hey, it's not your fault.

17:26.546 --> 17:30.717
Uh, it happens
all the time, I...

17:30.750 --> 17:33.120
-Oh, well.

17:33.153 --> 17:34.587
HUELL HOWSER :
Those are friendly, aren't they?

17:34.621 --> 17:36.723
WOMAN : They are.
They're like big dogs, you know.

17:36.756 --> 17:38.858
-It's marijuana, madame.

17:38.891 --> 17:41.528
We will smoke it outside.

17:41.561 --> 17:45.532
Oh, no. Uh...
is that the same as grass?

17:45.565 --> 17:47.200
JULIEN:
Yes.

17:50.337 --> 17:53.039
-Sure, yeah. If you want to.
-Wait a second. Mom, no.

17:53.072 --> 17:54.474
What?

17:54.507 --> 17:56.609
You're weird enough.
Mom, don't do that.

17:56.643 --> 17:59.045
I don't take orders
from you anymore, Chip.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.447
I'm out of the rodeo.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.115
JULIEN:
Here you go.

18:02.149 --> 18:04.651
All right.

18:06.153 --> 18:07.954
Oh, God.

18:16.996 --> 18:18.431
-Oh.

18:18.465 --> 18:20.667
JULIEN:
No, that-that's good. Yeah.

18:20.700 --> 18:22.135
Oh.

18:22.169 --> 18:25.004
-Yeah.
-Mom, that's enough.

18:25.037 --> 18:26.773
Ooh.

18:26.806 --> 18:28.341
Oh.

18:28.375 --> 18:30.977
Sorry about Renoir, Chip.

18:31.010 --> 18:34.147
Sorry I was mean
to you at the rodeo.

18:34.181 --> 18:35.848
The opera and everything.

18:35.882 --> 18:39.852
I just... I just feel like
you could dig deeper.

18:39.886 --> 18:43.656
I feel like you could find
your true clown.

18:43.690 --> 18:46.326
Or cloon,
whatever you want to call it,

18:46.359 --> 18:48.195
but I think you have
a lot of talent,

18:48.228 --> 18:51.631
and I just want you to
dig a little deeper and...

18:51.664 --> 18:53.266
you know, get to it.

18:53.300 --> 18:54.767
JULIEN:
In a way, I mean, you...

18:54.801 --> 18:57.970
you got to get out
of your cocoon, you know.

18:58.004 --> 18:59.539
MRS. BASKETS: Right.
Get out of your little cocoon.

18:59.572 --> 19:01.708
-CLAUDIA: Yeah.
: Cocoon.

19:02.909 --> 19:05.144
Oh, you French.

19:05.178 --> 19:07.347
Now, you know, where would I be
if I didn't have my son?

19:07.380 --> 19:09.115
-JULIEN: Yeah. Oh, no.
-I wouldn't be,

19:09.148 --> 19:10.650
I wouldn't be able to meet
all these interesting people.

19:10.683 --> 19:11.851
JULIEN:
There you go. That's right.

19:11.884 --> 19:13.286
-CLAUDIA: It's true.

19:13.320 --> 19:15.154
-That's why you're here, man.
-I don't think you realize

19:15.188 --> 19:17.023
-what you-you add to my life.
-He's cool.

19:17.056 --> 19:19.526
Why, I'd be just an old woman

19:19.559 --> 19:23.496
sitting on a...
on a couch alone.

19:23.530 --> 19:26.733
You know? But here I am with,

19:26.766 --> 19:28.468
you know, world travellers,

19:28.501 --> 19:31.070
clowns, performers.

19:31.103 --> 19:32.839
-Cocoon. -CLAUDIA:
And a joint in your hand.

19:32.872 --> 19:35.174
-You cocoon.

19:35.208 --> 19:37.744
Cocoon.

19:37.777 --> 19:40.213
You know, some words
are just funny.

19:40.247 --> 19:42.181
-Cocoon.

19:42.215 --> 19:44.417
For the cloon.

19:44.451 --> 19:47.754
Get out of your...
get out of your cocoon.

19:47.787 --> 19:49.055
You little cloon.

19:49.088 --> 19:52.124
Spread your wings.

19:54.126 --> 19:55.428
: Oh.

19:55.462 --> 19:56.696
MRS. BASKETS:
Hey.

19:56.729 --> 19:59.332
-I have one question
for all of us.

19:59.366 --> 20:02.001
Is ev

20:17.384 --> 20:18.585
Hey.

20:18.618 --> 20:20.420
You look good, playa.

20:20.453 --> 20:22.455
Thanks for, uh, opening for us.

20:22.489 --> 20:24.691
Anything for my boy
on Thanksgiving.

20:24.724 --> 20:28.127
You got to help. You're the
only one that knows the kitchen.

20:28.160 --> 20:29.596
You sure?

20:29.629 --> 20:32.131
Yeah, man, you were one of
my best guys, Chip.

20:32.164 --> 20:34.434
-It still fits.
-Looks good.

20:34.467 --> 20:35.735
Do you have any new, uh,

20:35.768 --> 20:37.737
signature sauces that
I should know about?

20:37.770 --> 20:40.740
We have arrived.

20:40.773 --> 20:42.742
Take a deep breath.

20:42.775 --> 20:47.246
Ooh, I'm home!

20:47.280 --> 20:49.449
Welcome to Arby's.
What can I do for you?

20:49.482 --> 20:51.718
Welcome is right.
These are my new friends.

20:51.751 --> 20:55.888
And they have never had
the Arby's experience, so...

20:55.922 --> 20:57.490
Well, you got to get
curly fries.

20:57.524 --> 20:59.659
Curly fries!
They're like french fries,

20:59.692 --> 21:01.794
but they're curly,

21:01.828 --> 21:04.096
they're seasoned,
and they're better.

21:04.130 --> 21:07.400
No offense to the French,
but they are.

21:07.434 --> 21:09.936
Hey, Jode.
This, uh, Arby's sign fell.

21:09.969 --> 21:11.938
It's all right, man,
just set it down.

21:11.971 --> 21:13.473
MRS. BASKETS:
Hey, bring that home.

21:13.506 --> 21:16.108
I'd love to have that
in the kitchen.

21:16.142 --> 21:18.911
Oh, thank you for
saving Thanksgiving.

21:18.945 --> 21:20.513
Ah, don't thank me.

21:20.547 --> 21:22.081
Thank Arby.

21:22.114 --> 21:24.183
I do every day.
