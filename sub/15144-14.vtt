20:50.375 --> 20:53.291
[all speaking at once]

20:58.458 --> 21:01.959
- Kids, kids, quiet.

20:58.458 --> 21:01.959
Quiet.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.750
[whispers]

21:02.000 --> 21:03.750
Mom's smiling.

21:06.333 --> 21:07.542
What are you smiling at?

21:07.583 --> 21:11.667
- The kids.

21:07.583 --> 21:11.667
You.

21:11.709 --> 21:14.208
This is my happy place.

21:14.250 --> 21:16.667
all: It is?

21:14.250 --> 21:16.667
- It is.

21:16.709 --> 21:20.208
- You-- you're not mad?

21:20.250 --> 21:22.667
- To be honest

21:20.250 --> 21:22.667
I expected a lot worse.

21:22.709 --> 21:24.667
I mean,

21:22.709 --> 21:24.667
everyone's wearing pants.

21:24.709 --> 21:26.625
The couch isn't on fire,

21:24.709 --> 21:26.625
and there's no donkeys.

21:26.667 --> 21:28.458
I'm good.

21:28.500 --> 21:30.750
- Yes.

21:28.500 --> 21:30.750
Super Dad does it again.

21:30.792 --> 21:33.583
- Mom, Dad, we're really sorry.

21:30.792 --> 21:33.583
- Yeah.

21:33.625 --> 21:36.166
None of this would have happened

21:33.625 --> 21:36.166
if we'd just followed the rules.

21:36.208 --> 21:39.125
- Guess that's why you guys

21:36.208 --> 21:39.125
make them for us.

21:39.166 --> 21:41.917
- Well, I guess there's only

21:39.166 --> 21:41.917
one thing left for you to do.

21:41.959 --> 21:43.917
- Clean up?

21:41.959 --> 21:43.917
- Yep.

21:43.959 --> 21:47.041
But first, why don't you

21:43.959 --> 21:47.041
play me that song?

21:47.083 --> 21:51.041
- This one's for a very special

21:47.083 --> 21:51.041
