It's a special coverage we at

Judge kavanaugh himself is about

the senate hearing room where

very open mind and that's why I
already voted yes for kavanaugh

blacked out?

Alyssa Milano behind you?

you look at the piece of paper

also squint and make your mouth

because I didn't have sex for
many, many, many years.

Judge Brett kavanaugh and

35:31.384 --> 35:33.354
Dr. Christine blasey Ford
appeared Thursday in front of

35:33.354 --> 35:35.184
the senate judiciary committee.
It was a classic debate of she

35:35.184 --> 35:36.554
said, she yelled.
This and his testimony, I guess

35:36.554 --> 35:37.984
kavanaugh thought the hearing
was about whether he was cool in

35:37.984 --> 35:39.084
high school.
We drank beer.

35:39.084 --> 35:40.784
I liked beer.
Still like beer.

35:40.784 --> 35:42.514
I worked out with other guys at
Tobin's house.

35:42.514 --> 35:45.814
We drank beer, we liked beer.
Working out, lifting weights.

35:45.814 --> 35:49.684
Just to meet up and have some
beers.

35:49.684 --> 35:51.554
I got to say, you're not
really helping yourself in a

35:51.554 --> 35:53.584
drunken assault case when you
yell about how much you liked

35:53.584 --> 35:54.714
drinking and how strong you were
at the time.

35:54.714 --> 35:57.614
Pretty much the only ones who
kept their composure in the

35:57.614 --> 35:59.954
entire hearing were the woman
being questioned and the women

35:59.954 --> 36:02.214
Republicans had to hire to talk
to the woman being questioned.

36:02.214 --> 36:05.184
Now, I know on an optics level,
I understand why the Republicans

36:05.184 --> 36:07.584
did that.
But if you're not the right

36:07.584 --> 36:10.454
person to ask questions at a
senate hearing, maybe you're not

36:10.454 --> 36:17.684
the right person to be a
senator.

36:17.684 --> 36:23.514
I just want to remind
everybody that all that yelling

36:23.514 --> 36:27.884
and crying happened at a job
interview.

36:27.884 --> 36:35.214
I mean typically when you're
asked about a sexual assault and

36:35.214 --> 36:40.814
your drinking problem at job
interview, you don't get the

36:40.814 --> 36:44.684
damn job.
I don't know if Mr. Kavanaugh

36:44.684 --> 36:46.454
has a history of assault or if
he actually has a drinking

36:46.454 --> 36:47.884
problem.
But I do know that he might.

36:47.884 --> 36:51.214
And you shouldn't be on the
supreme court if you might.

36:51.214 --> 36:52.614
I mean you shouldn't be on the
people's court if you might.

36:52.614 --> 36:53.554
Sometimes might is enough.
Okay?

36:53.554 --> 37:00.784
Like you can't board a plane if
you might be a terrorist.

37:00.784 --> 37:05.214
We can't have sex if you might
have dated Charlie sheen.

37:05.214 --> 37:11.084
And then, of course, there
are his calendars.

37:11.084 --> 37:12.514
You know, I have to say, if you
have calendars from 1982, it

37:12.514 --> 37:13.854
does not just prove you're
innocent.

37:13.854 --> 37:19.984
It does prove you're a hoarder,
you know when most people throw

37:19.984 --> 37:23.514
out their calendars from 1982?
1983.

37:23.514 --> 37:24.954
Also if you're drinking a bunch
and you keep a calendar, it's

37:24.954 --> 37:26.714
probably to help piece together
what happened in your life.

37:26.714 --> 37:28.614
He kept a calendar the same way
the guy in "momento" got

37:28.614 --> 37:31.384
tattoos.
Now, to be fair to

37:31.384 --> 37:42.114
judge kavanaugh, it's insane
that he has to answer questions

37:42.114 --> 37:46.014
about his high school year book.
If you looked into anyone's high

37:46.014 --> 37:52.414
school year book, there would be
something super embarrassing.

37:52.414 --> 37:54.914
Like I regret that my senior
quote was a smash mouth Lyric.

37:54.914 --> 38:00.614
And I very much regret that my
hair style was "the Rachel."

38:00.614 --> 38:10.484
But it they do ask about your
year book, why would you lie?

38:10.484 --> 38:12.084
Which reminds me that devil's
triangle is not a drinking game.

38:12.084 --> 38:14.284
But speaking of drinking games,
if you took a shot for every

38:14.284 --> 38:16.784
time kavanaugh lied about his
year book, you'd be as drunk as

38:16.784 --> 38:20.154
Brett kavanaugh was in the
summer of '82.

38:20.154 --> 38:22.384
You know, these hearings, I
learned a lot about what happens

38:22.384 --> 38:25.584
at white prep schools.
And I'm sending my kids to a

38:25.584 --> 38:34.654
black school where it's safe.
Of course this is a big deal.

38:34.654 --> 38:40.784
Because the supreme court judge
a lifetime job and sadly that's

38:40.784 --> 38:43.284
more importedant to congress
than the concerns off thankful

38:43.284 --> 38:47.414
country.
Kavanaugh could be the deciding

38:47.414 --> 38:49.314
vote on issues concerning the
very people he makes feel

38:49.314 --> 38:51.254

drop everything else and only

If you can't be a person of

59:23.784 --> 59:25.884
integrity while having all of
these things, what does it

59:25.884 --> 59:29.714
matter?
What does it mean?

59:29.714 --> 59:41.854
The value is internal.
Your value is internal.

A couple of league of the

01:00:10.614 --> 01:00:12.484
They have been selling
confederate flag blankets.

01:00:12.484 --> 01:00:15.754
All proceeds go to the troops.
And there's been some complaints

01:00:15.754 --> 01:00:16.754
about our fantasy football
league.

01:00:16.754 --> 01:00:18.884
We're going to go ahead and say
you can pick black players on

01:00:18.884 --> 01:00:20.454
your team.
So that's going to help things

01:00:20.454 --> 01:00:21.784

Now Jim has something important

01:00:21.784 --> 01:00:27.248
to say.
Oh, friends, you've seen it.

01:00:27.250 --> 01:00:29.050
It's been over a year since we
marched on charlottesville and

01:00:29.050 --> 01:00:32.110
things haven't gotten better.
More foreigners coming in.

01:00:32.110 --> 01:00:35.050
More strangers who don't respect
our way of life.

01:00:35.050 --> 01:00:38.680

Okay.

01:00:39.682 --> 01:00:45.995
All right.
So tonight, I have a plan.

01:00:45.997 --> 01:00:49.627
A grand vision.
If they're going to keep coming

01:00:49.627 --> 01:00:51.227
here, then we're going to go
someplace else.

01:00:51.227 --> 01:00:55.157
Our own place for our own
people.

01:00:55.157 --> 01:00:57.357
All right, no immigrants, no
minorities.

01:00:57.357 --> 01:00:59.727
An aguarian community where
everyone lives in Harmony

01:00:59.727 --> 01:01:00.997
because every single person is
white.

01:01:00.997 --> 01:01:04.597
Yes, sir.
I know that place.

01:01:04.597 --> 01:01:10.027
That sounds like Vermont.
Vermont?

01:01:10.027 --> 01:01:11.827
No, sir.
What I'm talking about is a

01:01:11.827 --> 01:01:15.157
place purely for caucasians,
where even the folks who wash

01:01:15.157 --> 01:01:17.297
the dishes and pick the fruit
are white.

01:01:17.297 --> 01:01:24.697
Oh, yeah, that's Vermont.
Excuse me, are you new here?

01:01:24.697 --> 01:01:25.727
Yeah, I'm originally from up
north.

01:01:25.727 --> 01:01:27.797
Oh, whoa, whoa.
No, no, don't worry, I'm from

01:01:27.797 --> 01:01:33.227
Boston.
Okay, okay, good, good.

01:01:33.227 --> 01:01:34.797
I've been to Vermont many times
and it's just like what you're

01:01:34.797 --> 01:01:36.697
saying.
I'm sorry but you don't seem

01:01:36.697 --> 01:01:39.097
to understand.
What I'm proposing is a whole

01:01:39.097 --> 01:01:43.757
new society going back to a time
when a white man can take the

01:01:43.757 --> 01:01:45.697
things that he grew from the
ground and trade them with

01:01:45.697 --> 01:01:49.097
another white man who grew
things from the ground.

01:01:49.097 --> 01:01:53.227
That's the farmer's market
and they're all over Vermont.

01:01:53.227 --> 01:01:54.897
Damn it, this ain't some
yankee commune.

01:01:54.897 --> 01:01:58.397
The place I'm envisioning is a
paradise.

01:01:58.397 --> 01:01:59.727
Country stores.
Yep.

01:01:59.727 --> 01:02:06.157
We've got covered Bridges.
Oh, yeah.

01:02:06.157 --> 01:02:07.627
The kind of place where you
can drive around in an old car

01:02:07.627 --> 01:02:08.997
and wave to folks on porches
having breakfast.

01:02:08.997 --> 01:02:14.697
Yeah, I'm sorry, I saw that
last week in Vermont.

01:02:14.697 --> 01:02:16.127
Yeah, well, okay, well be
that as it may, no one wants to

01:02:16.127 --> 01:02:18.627
move to Vermont, right?
I don't know.

01:02:18.627 --> 01:02:20.897
It sounds kind of nice.
Are there lots of dogs running

01:02:20.897 --> 01:02:31.157
around wearing bandanas?
Of course they are.

01:02:31.157 --> 01:02:39.427
We're getting off track.
You know how we were going to

01:02:39.427 --> 01:02:43.127
go to colonial williamsburg
again?

01:02:43.127 --> 01:02:44.227
Maybe we should go to Vermont.
Come on.

01:02:44.227 --> 01:02:45.997
You want colonial williamsburg.
It's things as it should be.

01:02:45.997 --> 01:02:47.127
I know, Jim, but this place
sounds nice.

01:02:47.127 --> 01:02:50.527
Pancakes on the porch.
Spiked apple compost, the leaves

01:02:50.527 --> 01:02:54.157
change colors but the people
never do.

01:02:54.157 --> 01:02:57.457
Why wouldn't we want to go?
And I just found an airbnb in

01:02:57.457 --> 01:03:00.257
shelburne and listen to this.

01:03:00.257 --> 01:03:03.327

Vermont, why would I want to
go there?

There's no hip-hop on the radio,
people paying to run around in a
