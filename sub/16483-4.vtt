00:01.252 --> 00:03.337
<i>Previously on</i>
Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D....

00:03.504 --> 00:05.756
You've already met Aida,
as a voice on the computer.

00:05.923 --> 00:07.133
I built her a body.

00:07.299 --> 00:09.593
God, Lucy, look at you.
What happened?

00:09.760 --> 00:11.679
We shouldn't have used
the Darkhold.

00:11.846 --> 00:14.223
That book can help us now.
Fix us.

00:14.390 --> 00:17.393
We're gonna find the book,
and stop anyone who tries to get it.

00:17.560 --> 00:19.020
Stay away from me!

00:19.186 --> 00:21.605
- She was touched by a ghost.
- We're gonna have to kill her.

00:21.772 --> 00:23.024
Wake up!

00:24.233 --> 00:26.694
<i>There's a group called
the Watchdogs. They're hunting Inhumans.</i>

00:26.777 --> 00:28.237
And who knows
what kind of weapon they stole

00:28.320 --> 00:29.697
<i>from the energy lab in Pasadena.</i>

00:29.864 --> 00:33.159
What are you?

00:35.286 --> 00:37.663
You know someone that worked
at that Momentum facility?

00:37.830 --> 00:38.748
My uncle.

00:38.831 --> 00:41.709
Uncle Elias Morrow?
Doing time at South Ridge Penitentiary?

00:41.876 --> 00:44.128
<i>He's a good man,
and he did a bad thing.</i>

00:44.295 --> 00:45.504
<i>Going to go see him.</i>

00:54.764 --> 00:56.057
It checks all our boxes.

00:56.223 --> 00:59.852
Hardwood floors, breakfast nook,
bay window, cosy and charming.

01:00.019 --> 01:02.813
Yeah, well, "cosy" means small
and "charming" means old.

01:02.980 --> 01:04.230
<i>Where did you find this place?</i>

01:04.315 --> 01:05.399
An e-mail offer.

01:05.441 --> 01:07.234
Honestly, it was almost
too good to be true.

01:07.359 --> 01:09.320
This is the one, Fitz. I can feel it.

01:09.487 --> 01:11.530
And it's, uh... It's definitely
within our price range?

01:11.697 --> 01:14.325
Can one really put a dollar
amount on the perfect home?

01:14.492 --> 01:16.452
<i>Yes, one can, and we did.</i>

01:16.619 --> 01:19.789
And it'll be well worth it,
I promise.

01:20.414 --> 01:21.707
Shame you can't be here.

01:21.874 --> 01:24.376
<i>My one day not working,
and you're in the thick of it.</i>

01:24.543 --> 01:26.337
Yeah, but I'm heading to Radcliffe's.

01:26.629 --> 01:28.422
It seems you're spending
all your time there lately.

01:28.506 --> 01:29.924
<i>Does it? Uh, I guess so.</i>

01:30.174 --> 01:34.220
Trying to figure out a less deadly way
to cure our ghost victims.

01:34.386 --> 01:35.387
<i>Take lots of pictures!</i>

01:35.554 --> 01:37.681
You've got it. Plenty of pictures.

01:37.848 --> 01:39.558
And good luck. I'll see you tonight.

01:39.725 --> 01:42.144
<i>- Love you.</i>
- Yeah, I love you, too.

01:52.696 --> 01:53.864
Hello?

01:54.615 --> 01:56.575
I'm here about the apartment.

02:04.416 --> 02:06.210
Is anybody here?

02:27.523 --> 02:29.483
Daisy?

02:29.650 --> 02:33.571
Sorry.
I had nowhere else to turn.

02:46.458 --> 02:48.252
Eli, you've got a visitor.

03:17.489 --> 03:19.867
- Who the hell are you?
- Agent Phil Coulson.

03:20.034 --> 03:22.119
I'm with
the Strategic Homeland Intervention,

03:22.286 --> 03:23.954
Enforcement and Logistics Division.

03:26.040 --> 03:28.500
S.H.I.E.L.D.? Still a thing?

03:28.876 --> 03:30.169
We're making a comeback.

03:30.711 --> 03:32.254
I'm here about an incident that occurred

03:32.421 --> 03:35.257
at Momentum Alternative Energy
Lab when you worked there.

03:35.674 --> 03:37.176
Is there anything you can tell me?

03:37.551 --> 03:39.178
There's not much information
out there.

03:39.637 --> 03:42.097
Think tank working
on undisclosed projects,

03:42.264 --> 03:43.432
and then there's an accident.

03:44.266 --> 03:45.184
"Accident."

03:46.227 --> 03:49.438
- Are you saying it was something else?
- I'm not saying anything.

03:49.647 --> 03:51.440
I'm sure it wasn't easy growing
up where you did,

03:51.607 --> 03:54.401
but you were 1 in 10 from your high school
to graduate from college

03:54.568 --> 03:56.820
and the only one
to go on and get a PhD.

03:56.987 --> 03:59.657
You worked hard to provide
for your sister and her kids,

03:59.823 --> 04:01.158
so I think you're a decent guy.

04:01.325 --> 04:05.079
Sure, some petty theft as a kid,
but no history of violence.

04:05.496 --> 04:08.582
But then one bad situation
turned into a manslaughter charge.

04:08.832 --> 04:11.752
I don't expect you to open up
to a suit with a badge...

04:11.919 --> 04:13.337
Suits like you is why I'm in here.

04:13.504 --> 04:16.882
But there's a chance, if you help me,
that I can help you get out of here.

04:27.226 --> 04:29.895
Let me get that for you, Agent May.

04:31.272 --> 04:32.731
Apologies.

04:32.940 --> 04:34.149
That must have been annoying.

04:34.233 --> 04:35.526
Incredibly.

04:36.110 --> 04:37.820
Oh, speaking of which...

04:38.070 --> 04:39.697
You seem to be feeling better,
Agent May.

04:40.447 --> 04:42.533
No doubt in part to the care
Aida has given to you.

04:43.367 --> 04:46.203
Aida's my assistant.
She's been tending to you since...

04:47.037 --> 04:49.290
- Since the procedure.
- Procedure?

04:49.456 --> 04:51.625
Dr Radcliffe stopped your heart
for seven minutes

04:51.792 --> 04:53.711
in order to reboot
your central nervous system.

04:53.877 --> 04:55.045
You did what?

04:55.212 --> 04:59.091
Well, in order to quell the hyperactivity
in your reticular activating system,

04:59.258 --> 05:04.888
we had to... very carefully, gently...
kill you. Just a little bit.

05:06.557 --> 05:09.268
- I died.
- Yes, and came back.

05:09.601 --> 05:12.855
- Killed, by Radcliffe.
- All for a good cause.

05:13.355 --> 05:14.690
And hopefully,
we have learned a great deal

05:14.857 --> 05:17.067
that will help us cure others
who have been similarly affected.

05:17.234 --> 05:18.277
By killing them?

05:19.570 --> 05:20.696
No, no.

05:21.280 --> 05:22.573
Well, hopefully not.

05:22.740 --> 05:25.200
Agent Fitz and I are working
on our chemical solve

05:25.367 --> 05:27.328
for this... ghost virus.

05:27.828 --> 05:30.122
But to do so, we need
to run a few more tests.

05:30.873 --> 05:31.999
You're saying I can't leave.

05:32.916 --> 05:34.835
Soon. We're close.

05:35.169 --> 05:36.962
But Aida will be on hand
to help with further testing

05:37.129 --> 05:39.131
and to take care of your needs.

05:39.381 --> 05:40.424
Mm.

05:41.633 --> 05:44.011
You can trust me with your life,
Agent May.

05:47.306 --> 05:49.641
Whoever took this bullet out
did an awful job.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.352
I don't get an "A" for effort?

05:51.518 --> 05:53.103
You haven't been to a proper doctor?

05:53.312 --> 05:54.938
You're hard to get
an appointment with.

05:57.232 --> 05:58.942
I knew this place
was too good to be true.

06:00.486 --> 06:01.862
You've been tracking
my search history.

06:02.029 --> 06:04.823
Yeah, well, you were always
a sucker for a breakfast nook.

06:05.240 --> 06:07.159
But don't worry,
the place is yours.

06:07.326 --> 06:09.703
And it's rent-controlled now, so...

06:10.954 --> 06:13.207
- You really should not have...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:13.791 --> 06:15.793
You also searched
for double-vanity sinks.

06:16.043 --> 06:18.670
- Things with Fitz must be going well.
- Yeah.

06:18.837 --> 06:22.132
Though moving in together
will put it to the test, I'm sure.

06:23.509 --> 06:24.593
It'll be great.

06:25.552 --> 06:26.804
I'm really happy for you.

06:27.471 --> 06:28.555
Are you now?

06:33.477 --> 06:34.978
Oh, self-medicating.

06:35.938 --> 06:38.148
Those bone-restoration pills
you've been stealing

06:38.315 --> 06:39.483
don't relieve pain.

06:40.025 --> 06:41.568
Are you using your arm gauntlets?

06:41.860 --> 06:43.070
They don't work perfectly,

06:43.237 --> 06:45.030
but we specifically designed
them so that they...

06:45.197 --> 06:49.493
They're not exactly incognito.
Stop mothering me, please.

06:53.038 --> 06:53.956
There.

06:54.123 --> 06:56.917
Now you can get back
to Lone Rangering,

06:57.084 --> 06:59.378
- or whatever it is you've been doing.
- Not yet.

07:00.629 --> 07:03.424
I didn't come to you
just for the Band-Aids.

07:03.590 --> 07:06.343
I thought I'd kill
two birds with one stone.

07:06.510 --> 07:08.262
Am I the bird or the stone?

07:10.848 --> 07:12.266
- These are...
- Inhuman asset numbers

07:12.474 --> 07:15.018
- and GPS coordinates.
- Why do you have these?

07:15.185 --> 07:17.855
Snagged them from a group
of Watchdogs on my way here.

07:18.313 --> 07:20.190
Got a bullet for my trouble.

07:20.941 --> 07:24.069
They're hacking into S.H.I.E.L.D. servers.
That's how they find their victims.

07:24.236 --> 07:25.154
Impossible.

07:25.320 --> 07:27.156
S.H.I.E.L.D. servers are more secure now
than they've ever been.

07:27.322 --> 07:29.867
They're held offline
in protected government facilities to...

07:30.033 --> 07:32.744
Keep out people like me?
Yeah, well, they're getting in somehow.

07:33.245 --> 07:36.415
And... I need you
to do the same for me.

07:37.499 --> 07:40.127
You want me to help you hack
my own organisation?

07:40.836 --> 07:43.464
Simmons, they're targeting Inhumans.
They are murdering us.

07:43.630 --> 07:46.675
There are protocols, Daisy.
I take mandatory lie-detection tests.

07:46.842 --> 07:50.053
I can't just voluntarily aid
a wanted vigilante.

07:57.978 --> 07:59.396
What if it wasn't voluntary?

08:02.983 --> 08:05.694
I've missed you too.

08:07.821 --> 08:09.531
<i>It's hard to lose people
you care about.</i>

08:09.698 --> 08:10.824
<i>Believe me, I know.</i>

08:10.991 --> 08:13.202
Somewhere along the way,
something went wrong,

08:13.368 --> 08:16.955
and colleagues of yours,
friends of yours, died.

08:18.332 --> 08:20.334
I like to keep the past where it is.

08:20.501 --> 08:24.129
Well, unfortunately, your past
has come back to haunt you.

08:24.296 --> 08:25.672
Because your colleagues...

08:26.840 --> 08:28.133
Turns out they didn't die that day.

08:28.884 --> 08:29.968
What the hell
are you talking about?

08:30.135 --> 08:33.054
They're alive,
and they've gained abilities...

08:33.222 --> 08:35.140
abilities they're using to hurt people.

08:37.183 --> 08:38.309
Doesn't make any sense.

08:38.477 --> 08:40.604
Well, that's usually when
I enter the picture.

08:41.270 --> 08:43.023
I'm hoping
you can help me understand.

08:44.399 --> 08:45.776
Look, this is, uh...

08:47.903 --> 08:49.321
I don't want to get involved.

08:50.572 --> 08:51.949
I have to move on with my life.

08:52.324 --> 08:55.827
Any detail, even if it seems small,
could lead us to something.

08:56.495 --> 08:58.956
I can't talk to the only other
person related to this case

08:59.122 --> 09:00.707
because you put them in a coma.

09:01.333 --> 09:02.501
You're all I've got.

09:03.502 --> 09:04.836
Just point me in a direction.

09:07.005 --> 09:08.215
There's a direction for you.

09:14.972 --> 09:16.723
- Stonewalled?
- Is it all over my face?

09:17.307 --> 09:18.767
- Yeah.
- It was a first attempt.

09:18.934 --> 09:20.269
I didn't think he'd be
the trusting type.

09:20.978 --> 09:22.312
Besides, it's not easy to find out

09:22.479 --> 09:24.231
your colleagues are back
from the dead.

09:24.856 --> 09:26.149
Yeah, I can imagine.

09:36.118 --> 09:37.703
- No way.
- What?

09:40.998 --> 09:42.332
It's him, the matchstick guy.

09:42.499 --> 09:44.418
- From Momentum Lab?
- Yeah, get in the car. I'm driving.

09:44.585 --> 09:45.669
Oh, hell no.

10:21.788 --> 10:23.624
What do you weigh, 210, 220?

10:23.790 --> 10:25.500
That's not the extra weight,
it's your driving!

10:25.709 --> 10:28.337
- You should've let me take the wheel!
- My car. I drive.

10:28.712 --> 10:30.505
You wouldn't fit behind the wheel anyway.

10:35.677 --> 10:37.763
- Duck!
- No, no, no, no!

11:00.744 --> 11:02.454
Oh, you're gonna have to do
better than that.

11:17.552 --> 11:20.847
Can't be a standard Magnum under the hood.
That's got to be at least a 426 Hemi.

11:21.181 --> 11:23.100
Maybe admire his car after we catch him.
What do you think?

11:24.768 --> 11:25.644
Yeah, we'll never catch him.

11:25.811 --> 11:28.355
I told you, you should've let me fix
the flight functionality in this thing.

11:28.522 --> 11:30.357
Don't worry. It's not gonna be
a problem this time.

12:00.095 --> 12:02.639
I get his car now, right?
Isn't that how this works?

12:06.810 --> 12:09.187
Okay.
Let's go over it one more time.

12:09.354 --> 12:10.272
Is that necessary?

12:10.439 --> 12:11.815
Yes, because we cannot afford
to slip up.

12:11.982 --> 12:13.942
Okay. So, in that high-security building

12:14.109 --> 12:16.319
is one of the Inhuman registration
information servers.

12:16.486 --> 12:18.655
I'm aware of how my own agency
operates, thank you.

12:18.822 --> 12:19.948
Every day at the same time,

12:20.115 --> 12:23.869
Agent Elizabeth Albee brings a drive
with updated information to this location.

12:24.035 --> 12:25.412
I'm to steal her I.D. badge...

12:25.579 --> 12:27.956
So I can clone it and put
a fake identity on top of it.

12:28.123 --> 12:31.835
And then, you're
gonna take this flash drive...

12:32.753 --> 12:35.380
- Insert it into the server...
- And it'll give me remote access.

12:38.049 --> 12:40.427
Oh, there she is. Right on time.

12:41.052 --> 12:42.345
Okay, so we need to...

12:43.472 --> 12:45.515
Simmons. Simmons!

12:52.564 --> 12:54.232
What the hell is she doing?

13:09.122 --> 13:10.457
Nailed it.

13:10.957 --> 13:13.543
What do you mean you nailed it?
What did you even do?

13:13.710 --> 13:15.212
I simply told Agent Albee

13:15.378 --> 13:16.922
that there was new information
on the flash drive

13:17.005 --> 13:18.632
and she's going to deliver it
with the rest.

13:19.090 --> 13:20.133
That should give us access.

13:20.592 --> 13:22.886
And how did you get her
to agree to that?

13:23.303 --> 13:26.223
Well, technically, as S.H.I.E.L.D.'s
Special Advisor in Science and Technology,

13:26.389 --> 13:27.682
she works for me.

13:30.018 --> 13:31.186
I'm the boss.

13:34.898 --> 13:37.400
There must be a way to synthesise
the necessary neurotransmitters

13:37.567 --> 13:39.653
to regulate thalamocortical activity.

13:39.820 --> 13:41.404
Or block reception altogether.

13:41.571 --> 13:43.865
You know, a way to trick
the brain out of fear

13:44.032 --> 13:45.826
and the resultant
physical strain on the body.

13:45.992 --> 13:48.036
Hm. What I wouldn't have given
for that in primary school.

13:48.203 --> 13:50.163
I used to get so nervous,
my eyes would all bug out,

13:50.330 --> 13:51.623
and... And lose my breath.

13:54.459 --> 13:57.087
Aida, she's out.
Why... Why... Why would she be out?

13:58.547 --> 14:01.049
Oh, you're right. Your eyes do
all bug out when you get nervous.

14:01.758 --> 14:02.926
Why are you not nervous?

14:03.844 --> 14:05.053
Because I let her out.

14:06.054 --> 14:08.640
- Are you mad?
- No, I'm just a scientist.

14:08.807 --> 14:10.225
This is... This is a huge risk.

14:10.308 --> 14:11.810
You can't... You can't
just parade her about.

14:11.893 --> 14:12.978
No one's supposed to know
about her.

14:13.144 --> 14:15.605
I know it's a risk,
but it's a risk we have to take.

14:15.772 --> 14:18.733
You have improved
her social cues dramatically.

14:18.942 --> 14:23.196
We are on the cusp.
This is the ultimate Turing Test.

14:23.363 --> 14:25.907
I mean, who better
to put Aida through her paces

14:26.074 --> 14:29.744
than the most discerning, formidable agent
that S.H.I.E.L.D. has to offer?

14:31.913 --> 14:35.834
Fitz, art and science
have their meeting in method.

14:36.042 --> 14:39.838
Oh, do... do not go quoting
bloody Bulwer-Lytton at me.

14:40.213 --> 14:41.339
Fitz.

14:48.638 --> 14:50.682
Hello, Fitz. Always nice to see you.

14:50.849 --> 14:54.060
Hello. Um, how... What is...

14:54.227 --> 14:55.854
What is... How is everything
going in here?

14:57.063 --> 15:00.358
Still waiting for them to finish the test
so I can get the hell out of here.

15:00.525 --> 15:03.737
Just assessing any last glitches
before we send May on her way.

15:06.781 --> 15:07.699
Good.

15:09.284 --> 15:10.911
We'll leave the women to it,
shall we?

15:15.957 --> 15:19.044
Every Inhuman has a wristwatch,
an Asset Communication Device

15:19.210 --> 15:20.962
that tracks location, vital signs,
et cetera.

15:21.129 --> 15:22.422
I mean, it's for their own safety.

15:22.797 --> 15:24.424
Yeah, how's that working out so far?

15:24.591 --> 15:25.675
Well, I...

15:29.554 --> 15:30.972
Elizabeth Albee came through.

15:31.139 --> 15:33.975
Looks like an encrypted third party's
hijacking the stream of information...

15:34.142 --> 15:36.144
As the devices send and receive signals.

15:36.686 --> 15:38.355
So much for new security measures.

15:38.521 --> 15:40.482
If they can tap into the data
directly, then they have...

15:40.649 --> 15:42.651
Information on a lot of Inhumans.

15:44.945 --> 15:46.613
I warned everyone on this list, but...

15:46.780 --> 15:48.198
Let's just see
how many compromised names

15:48.365 --> 15:49.407
you weren't able to...

15:50.116 --> 15:52.285
Wait. I recognise that number.
Who is it?

15:56.498 --> 15:58.416
James.

15:58.875 --> 16:01.419
I haven't seen him since... Hive.

16:01.586 --> 16:04.422
Right. Well, withdrawal from Hive's sway

16:04.589 --> 16:06.716
- hit him even harder than you.
- I can imagine.

16:06.883 --> 16:09.386
We did everything we could
for him, but, like yourself,

16:09.552 --> 16:11.429
it seemed he couldn't get away
from us fast enough.

16:12.222 --> 16:14.349
Only shows his face
at mandatory check-ins.

16:17.769 --> 16:20.021
Thank you for your help.

16:20.188 --> 16:21.439
It was good to see you.

16:21.606 --> 16:22.607
Where are you going?

16:22.774 --> 16:25.276
James is next on their to-do list.
I have to get to him before they do.

16:25.360 --> 16:26.444
We have to get to him!

16:26.528 --> 16:28.363
In case you don't remember,
that's my job.

16:28.530 --> 16:32.158
I appreciate the help, Simmons,
but I can take it from here... on my own.

16:32.409 --> 16:34.077
You can't have it both ways, Daisy.

16:34.244 --> 16:36.579
You can't push us away and then
come crawling back, half-dead,

16:36.746 --> 16:39.249
only when you feel like it.
It isn't fair.

16:39.416 --> 16:41.001
You've already put a gun to my head.

16:41.501 --> 16:42.752
We're in this together now.

16:43.837 --> 16:44.754
So suck it up.

16:53.263 --> 16:54.848
Damn. Not even a dent.

16:55.140 --> 16:57.100
I wouldn't mind
having a superpower like that

16:57.267 --> 16:58.143
for a day or two.

16:58.309 --> 16:59.644
Hands off my ride, man.

17:00.186 --> 17:01.396
The car is safe.

17:02.522 --> 17:04.398
Your situation's a little more precarious.

17:04.566 --> 17:06.151
You really think
this thing can hold me?

17:08.111 --> 17:10.320
It's contained a lot more
dangerous people than you.

17:10.821 --> 17:11.781
Is that a dare?

17:12.531 --> 17:14.325
I've heard rumours
from your part of the world

17:14.992 --> 17:16.828
about a man
with a flaming skull.

17:16.994 --> 17:18.829
Always seemed like
an urban legend to me.

17:18.997 --> 17:21.207
You've managed to escape capture
all this time.

17:21.374 --> 17:23.042
And we nab you in a parking lot.

17:23.209 --> 17:24.377
That's gotta hurt.

17:26.378 --> 17:27.464
We got facts, too.

17:27.839 --> 17:29.799
Robbie Reyes...
dropped out of Garfield High.

17:30.050 --> 17:32.635
Took work at Canelo Auto
and Body to help pay the rent.

17:32.802 --> 17:34.054
A halfway decent driver.

17:34.220 --> 17:35.346
With a few bad habits.

17:35.638 --> 17:38.349
Well, one really bad habit
of killing people.

17:39.726 --> 17:41.019
Only those who have it coming.

17:41.603 --> 17:43.396
From what I can tell,
that seems to be true.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.148
Which makes you
a little more interesting.

17:45.231 --> 17:46.941
Well, I have a code I try to live by.

17:47.025 --> 17:48.985
And a penchant
for spontaneous combustion,

17:49.152 --> 17:50.612
which, I must say, sounds painful.

17:50.779 --> 17:52.906
How do you do it?
You're not an Inhuman, are you?

17:53.615 --> 17:54.908
Why do you guys
keep asking me that?

17:55.075 --> 17:56.493
Then where does your power
come from?

17:59.370 --> 18:01.122
I made a deal with the devil.

18:02.457 --> 18:05.418
Right. Okay. Just...

18:10.465 --> 18:11.382
Okay.

18:12.175 --> 18:13.718
Ghosts, devils...

18:14.969 --> 18:16.471
You believe any of this stuff
we're dealing with?

18:16.638 --> 18:19.057
I believe in God, so I gotta
believe in the other thing.

18:19.224 --> 18:23.770
Well, in my experience, gods
usually turn out to be aliens.

18:24.104 --> 18:26.648
Alien would definitely explain
the things he can do.

18:27.857 --> 18:31.528
He was at the Momentum Lab
and showed up at the prison, too.

18:31.945 --> 18:33.279
We're chasing the same things.

18:34.364 --> 18:36.699
- You said Daisy trusts him?
- Maybe.

18:37.033 --> 18:39.869
- Huh.
- Why? Why, what are you thinking?

18:42.497 --> 18:43.540
Coulson!

18:46.751 --> 18:47.836
What the hell are you doing?

18:48.837 --> 18:51.131
I think it's time I make
a deal with the devil myself.

19:11.860 --> 19:13.069
This is where James works?

19:13.528 --> 19:14.612
Afraid so.

19:15.029 --> 19:18.908
Well, whoever's running the
Terrible Ideas Division is crushing it.

19:27.083 --> 19:28.960
Now, stop me
if you've heard this before.

19:29.794 --> 19:33.381
Five-hundred-gram repeater,
ten shots of gold chrysanthemum.

19:33.965 --> 19:36.509
I've seen it take
a man's arm clear off.

19:37.093 --> 19:38.636
So if you boys
have got a death wish...

19:39.762 --> 19:40.889
Mm?

19:45.018 --> 19:46.936
- This bomb's for you.
- We'll take five.

19:47.312 --> 19:48.521
Excellent choice.

19:49.397 --> 19:50.398
Hello, James.

19:53.067 --> 19:55.612
Uh, go see Sean.
Uh, he'll take care of you.

20:00.116 --> 20:01.284
Agent Simmons.

20:01.451 --> 20:02.493
How are you?

20:04.412 --> 20:06.414
Surprised to see S.H.I.E.L.D.
at my doorstep,

20:06.956 --> 20:09.167
and with the infamous vigilante in tow.

20:09.584 --> 20:10.919
Quake now, isn't it?

20:11.085 --> 20:13.379
I didn't come up with it.
But it's growing on me.

20:14.339 --> 20:15.673
Burn the candle at both ends.

20:16.007 --> 20:19.886
Speaking of burning, fireworks? Really?
With your powers?

20:22.639 --> 20:25.558
Sean over there...
long-time smoker, 30 years.

20:25.808 --> 20:26.726
He gave up last summer.

20:27.852 --> 20:29.979
He keeps a single cigarette on his desk

20:30.688 --> 20:33.316
as a constant reminder
of what he doesn't want to be.

20:33.983 --> 20:36.319
- It's kind of like that.
- We're just glad to see you're safe.

20:37.028 --> 20:38.238
Why wouldn't I be?

20:38.404 --> 20:39.822
The recent Watchdog attacks.

20:40.031 --> 20:42.909
They're finding their targets
by hacking into asset comms devices.

20:44.452 --> 20:45.662
They can track your location.

20:46.412 --> 20:47.413
So you think they're after me.

20:47.705 --> 20:48.831
It's only a matter of time.

20:49.958 --> 20:51.000
Take it off.

20:52.001 --> 20:54.671
I wasn't really a willing participant
in this little security measure.

20:55.463 --> 20:56.839
Mine doesn't come off.

20:59.842 --> 21:01.177
Daisy.

21:02.887 --> 21:04.472
- We have to get you out of here.
- Nuh-huh

21:04.639 --> 21:06.724
I'm just trying to live
a quiet, normal life.

21:06.933 --> 21:09.352
You don't understand.
That can't happen anymore.

21:09.686 --> 21:12.438
The Watchdogs won't let you.
They are coming to take that life.

21:14.190 --> 21:16.067
What's it worth, anyway, hmm?

21:16.234 --> 21:18.778
I go from my rubbish job
to my rubbish apartment.

21:19.654 --> 21:21.072
I got no family...

21:21.698 --> 21:23.032
no reason to...

21:26.911 --> 21:28.454
You know what that feels like,
don't you?

21:29.664 --> 21:32.041
S.H.I.E.L.D. is here
to help you move on, James.

21:33.001 --> 21:34.502
Or you can take a stand with me.

21:36.045 --> 21:38.548
Fight back.
That's how you move on.

21:38.840 --> 21:40.925
Take control of your life again.

21:49.851 --> 21:52.186
I've got some stuff
to finish up, but, um...

21:52.770 --> 21:55.315
meet me after closing at the
public-storage place next door.

21:56.107 --> 21:57.650
Pod 212, second floor.

21:59.235 --> 22:00.778
I got something that might help.

22:07.702 --> 22:10.913
Damn, you two must be straight <i>loco</i>
letting me out of my cage like that.

22:11.080 --> 22:13.291
Yeah, I was just thinking
the same thing.

22:13.458 --> 22:15.668
I flame up, I can bring
this whole plane crashing down.

22:15.835 --> 22:18.004
With you in it?
I don't think you'll do that.

22:18.171 --> 22:20.089
Flying isn't one
of your special talents.

22:20.715 --> 22:23.926
I'm opening a door for you, Mr Reyes,
both literally and figuratively.

22:25.178 --> 22:29.349
- And in return you want...
- Same thing you do. Answers.

22:29.724 --> 22:32.393
And your Uncle Eli has them.
That's why you were going to see him.

22:32.935 --> 22:35.938
See, I think we're on the same side,
but I need you to prove it to me.

22:37.315 --> 22:39.067
Prove you're not the demon
the stories say you are.

22:39.275 --> 22:42.236
You saved a friend of mine from a guy
my bullets went straight through.

22:42.403 --> 22:44.655
You're the only one we know
that can hurt those things.

22:44.822 --> 22:45.990
So let's help each other.

22:46.157 --> 22:48.409
Eli won't talk to us,
but he'll talk to you.

22:48.951 --> 22:51.496
All we ask is that you let us
listen in on the conversation.

22:53.873 --> 22:54.916
And if I say no?

22:55.458 --> 22:56.417
Well...

22:57.377 --> 23:01.005
then we open another door for you,
but we won't land first.

23:05.093 --> 23:07.387
So, you see,
to cease the hormonal cascade

23:07.553 --> 23:08.721
produced by the adrenal medulla

23:08.888 --> 23:10.807
and prevent further
physical degradation...

23:10.973 --> 23:12.100
You shut off my brain.

23:12.266 --> 23:13.518
- Exactly.
- Mm.

23:13.768 --> 23:15.186
I'm glad you understand.

23:15.353 --> 23:16.604
Oh, that's the only thing
I understand.

23:16.771 --> 23:20.316
The point is, even though
you may be feeling better,

23:20.483 --> 23:24.028
you suffered some very real,
very severe brain trauma.

23:24.195 --> 23:26.114
That said,
we're gonna have to keep you

23:26.280 --> 23:28.116
just a wee bit longer
for further testing.

23:28.282 --> 23:29.951
Just to track your improvements
before we release you.

23:31.577 --> 23:32.662
Excuse me?

23:32.745 --> 23:34.580
Agent May says you can shove
all your tests up your ass.

23:34.664 --> 23:35.706
Well,
that's not very nice.

23:35.873 --> 23:38.251
You speak Chinese?
Where are you from?

23:38.418 --> 23:39.460
Well, most of me
is Chinese.

23:39.627 --> 23:44.215
Canadian. She's a Ca...
She's Canadian, Ontario.

23:44.382 --> 23:45.800
Yeah, yeah,
big Chinese population there.

23:45.967 --> 23:47.718
She did move around a lot
as a kid,

23:47.885 --> 23:49.262
- 'cause she's an army brat.
- Oh.

23:49.637 --> 23:50.805
Um, Aida, if you could go

23:50.972 --> 23:52.974
and ready the framework
for one last scan, please?

23:53.599 --> 23:54.600
Of course.

23:57.603 --> 23:59.188
You've been hiding Aida
from me.

24:03.609 --> 24:05.027
It's too bad.

24:05.194 --> 24:06.112
I like her.

24:06.279 --> 24:08.030
No nonsense, just business.

24:08.197 --> 24:09.198
Very impressive.

24:10.074 --> 24:10.992
Yeah.

24:12.034 --> 24:13.536
Yeah, they don't make them
like Aida, do they?

24:19.292 --> 24:20.460
How's my baby doing?

24:21.878 --> 24:23.212
You mean our baby.

24:24.213 --> 24:25.840
Had to replace
the fan belt.

24:26.215 --> 24:28.050
She's been overheating a bit lately.

24:29.010 --> 24:30.303
Nothing to worry about.

24:31.053 --> 24:33.598
- Your brother's good?
- He's good.

24:39.145 --> 24:41.272
It's not Christmas,
it's not my birthday.

24:41.772 --> 24:43.774
Can't I just come visit
my uncle when I want to?

24:43.983 --> 24:45.818
Yeah, I got S.H.I.E.L.D.
and you visiting me on the same day?

24:45.902 --> 24:47.028
Come on, Robbie.

24:49.906 --> 24:51.115
They just want to help.

24:52.241 --> 24:53.534
They just want answers.

24:53.701 --> 24:54.785
Answers for what?

24:56.621 --> 24:59.123
They say that this woman
that you used to work with

24:59.290 --> 25:02.126
- is out there killing people.
- Is that what they're saying?

25:03.544 --> 25:05.004
I'm just trying
to understand, man.

25:05.505 --> 25:07.089
I only know what you told me,

25:07.590 --> 25:10.092
that you put a beatdown
on your boss, that he deserved it.

25:11.636 --> 25:13.930
Why? Who is she?

25:16.849 --> 25:18.226
Dr Lucy Bauer.

25:19.352 --> 25:20.520
Joseph's wife.

25:21.646 --> 25:22.897
<i>You put him into a coma.</i>

25:23.981 --> 25:25.525
<i>What were they getting
into up there?</i>

25:25.691 --> 25:26.734
<i>Madness.</i>

25:26.901 --> 25:29.946
<i>They were the project leaders
of this privately funded think tank.</i>

25:30.112 --> 25:32.782
<i>- Momentum Labs.
- Yeah. Next-level R&D.</i>

25:32.949 --> 25:35.076
They needed an engineer
to help them build their design.

25:35.243 --> 25:36.994
They said they were very impressed
with me.

25:37.453 --> 25:40.206
But what they really wanted was someone
who wouldn't ask too many questions.

25:40.706 --> 25:41.874
And what were you building?

25:43.960 --> 25:45.711
A Quantum Particle Generator.

25:46.462 --> 25:49.966
It's a machine that can create matter
out of practically nothing at all.

25:50.466 --> 25:52.385
That sounds... impossible.

25:52.552 --> 25:53.719
Yeah, it's insane.

25:54.470 --> 25:56.180
Defies all the laws of physics.

25:56.347 --> 25:57.723
See, they thought
they were pushing boundaries,

25:57.807 --> 25:59.141
and I thought they were playing God.

25:59.308 --> 26:01.227
- And it blew up in their faces.
- Yeah, literally.

26:02.186 --> 26:03.688
They should've listened to me.

26:04.105 --> 26:07.358
The police said it was an accident,
but Joe made them move forward,

26:07.525 --> 26:10.528
and it killed them,
killed the whole team, his wife.

26:11.070 --> 26:12.238
Joe killed them.

26:12.863 --> 26:14.407
I was so pissed
at what he'd done,

26:15.199 --> 26:18.786
that I couldn't stop him.
But I just... I just... I snapped

26:19.495 --> 26:20.830
and I'm doing the time.

26:21.622 --> 26:24.083
You see, Robbie,
what I wanted was...

26:24.250 --> 26:25.334
Revenge.

26:29.171 --> 26:30.756
Why didn't you tell me
any of this before?

26:33.342 --> 26:35.136
Because you were just a kid.

26:36.512 --> 26:37.680
And I was...

26:38.014 --> 26:40.683
I was supposed to take care of you
and I let you down.

26:41.809 --> 26:44.604
But these are my demons.
They're not yours.

26:44.770 --> 26:46.272
Robbie, Lucy Bauer isn't dead.

26:46.439 --> 26:48.482
This accident must be how
she got her powers.

26:48.649 --> 26:50.985
Find out where she'd go.
What is she after?

26:51.152 --> 26:52.570
What is she after?

26:55.197 --> 26:56.365
She's gonna go after the book.

26:56.949 --> 27:00.119
<i>- Book? What book?
- I don't know what it's called.</i>

27:00.286 --> 27:02.788
<i>They say it gave them the knowledge
to build their machine.</i>

27:03.456 --> 27:04.874
<i>It has all the knowledge</i>

27:04.957 --> 27:06.500
<i>that anyone could ever need.</i>

27:07.376 --> 27:10.046
<i>- They all read it?
- Yeah. They were obsessed with it.</i>

27:10.755 --> 27:12.506
This book is evil, Robbie.

27:12.673 --> 27:14.842
I don't want you involved
with any of this.

27:15.009 --> 27:16.093
Coulson.

27:17.261 --> 27:19.597
We got to move.
We got a situation with an asset.

27:21.307 --> 27:22.433
A volatile one.

27:40.242 --> 27:41.577
Joseph.

27:43.245 --> 27:45.373
Wake up, Joseph. I need you.

27:45.998 --> 27:47.375
Wake up, please.

27:48.751 --> 27:50.086
Wake up.

28:01.097 --> 28:02.098
There you are.

28:03.391 --> 28:07.603
Now, tell me... Where's the book?

28:25.246 --> 28:26.330
What's going on?

28:26.497 --> 28:27.998
Took a while to catch up
with you guys.

28:28.165 --> 28:29.333
Had to get a head start.

28:29.500 --> 28:30.918
We going after that book?

28:31.085 --> 28:32.878
Not yet. Something came up.

28:33.587 --> 28:36.298
Yo, listen, I held up my end
of the deal, all right?

28:36.465 --> 28:39.343
Either we go and get after it,
or I take my car and I do it myself.

28:42.680 --> 28:43.764
That's not how things work here.

28:43.931 --> 28:45.516
We need to make a detour.

28:45.683 --> 28:47.893
We could use your help if you're still
interested in our arrangement.

28:48.060 --> 28:49.186
That depends on you.

28:59.155 --> 29:00.614
May I ask you a question?

29:01.282 --> 29:02.575
Of course. Ask me anything.

29:03.492 --> 29:06.245
Why did Fitz lie to Agent May
about where I'm from?

29:07.705 --> 29:09.415
You're still in the testing phase, Aida.

29:09.582 --> 29:13.335
The point of you is to pass for human.
You must always act accordingly.

29:15.963 --> 29:17.673
But you programmed me not to lie.

29:18.257 --> 29:19.300
It's one of my tenets,

29:19.467 --> 29:20.926
along with not harming humans
and being able to...

29:21.093 --> 29:24.138
Well, lies themselves
are not always inherently bad.

29:30.436 --> 29:31.896
Their intent can vary.

29:33.314 --> 29:35.441
Sometimes, it's okay to lie

29:35.608 --> 29:38.402
to shield people
from certain truths,

29:39.153 --> 29:41.989
to spare their feelings
or to save a life.

29:43.407 --> 29:45.409
Whose life was Fitz saving
when he lied?

29:46.327 --> 29:48.287
Why, yours.

29:58.547 --> 30:02.009
So, you're dragging James
into your vigilante quest.

30:02.551 --> 30:06.388
Is he your sidekick now?
Quake and the Amazing Bomb Boy?

30:06.555 --> 30:08.224
How about you go wait in the van?

30:08.390 --> 30:11.685
- We're supposed to be helping him.
- I am helping him.

30:12.520 --> 30:15.064
You've chosen to walk
your brooding path. Fine.

30:15.231 --> 30:16.690
Don't drag him down with you.

30:18.567 --> 30:20.986
I never tire of hearing
two women fight over me.

30:21.445 --> 30:24.240
What do you have for me?
We should be on the move.

30:24.782 --> 30:29.161
Oh. Well, that's a nice how-do-you-do.
You're gonna like this.

30:29.328 --> 30:31.872
We keep a lot of our raw materials
here in storage.

30:32.456 --> 30:34.667
Figure some explosives
might come in handy.

30:34.834 --> 30:36.168
It's a start.

30:36.335 --> 30:38.212
I could use a different type
of firepower right now.

30:38.379 --> 30:39.713
I've got you covered.

30:40.214 --> 30:43.050
Remember, I was lighting fuses long
before I was the fuse.

30:43.801 --> 30:46.512
Maybe doing some good
will make you feel better.

30:47.513 --> 30:49.598
I think it might. Yeah.

30:54.103 --> 30:56.772
This is your plan?
Explosives? What is wrong with you?

30:57.022 --> 30:58.774
This is not the solution
to anything.

30:58.941 --> 31:00.734
The Watchdogs are killing people.

31:00.901 --> 31:03.153
Violence, retaliation.
That is all they understand.

31:03.320 --> 31:05.114
If I have to speak their language,
then so be it.

31:07.908 --> 31:08.826
Hey.

31:09.577 --> 31:10.786
Just take it easy on her.

31:10.953 --> 31:12.621
She doesn't understand
what it's like...

31:13.330 --> 31:16.166
To change, to lose everything.

31:16.876 --> 31:19.295
I know. That's the point.

31:24.633 --> 31:25.843
Don't move. Stay right there.

31:26.760 --> 31:28.178
Put your hands up!

31:29.805 --> 31:31.265
Easy.

31:32.725 --> 31:33.726
Fight back, right?

31:35.311 --> 31:36.520
Only thing is...

31:39.815 --> 31:41.692
the Watchdogs aren't my enemy.

31:43.193 --> 31:46.697
You gave them access to your watch,
let them hijack the signal.

31:47.656 --> 31:50.784
You son of a bitch.
How could you do this to us?

31:50.951 --> 31:52.870
How could you do this to me?

31:53.037 --> 31:55.789
You're the one that turned me
into this freak of nature.

31:55.956 --> 31:58.417
You were obsessed
with going through Terrigenesis.

31:58.584 --> 31:59.835
I gave you what you wanted.

32:00.002 --> 32:04.006
I didn't ask for this.
Hive? And bloody misery.

32:04.173 --> 32:05.883
If I could take it all back,
I would.

32:06.050 --> 32:08.427
S.H.I.E.L.D. is putting everything
into helping Inhumans.

32:08.594 --> 32:10.137
Inhumans are a scourge.

32:10.304 --> 32:13.641
The Watchdogs have the right idea,
so I struck a deal with them.

32:14.141 --> 32:16.226
Help them hunt
and kill every Inhuman.

32:16.644 --> 32:18.437
Hey!

32:18.604 --> 32:20.773
Hunted like the animals that we are.

32:24.526 --> 32:26.570
And I'm gonna be the last one to go.

32:29.073 --> 32:30.783
You really hate yourself that much?

32:31.784 --> 32:34.828
I don't hate myself.
I hate all of us.

32:41.210 --> 32:42.419
I told you to wait in the van.

32:56.100 --> 32:57.267
Catch them!

33:02.731 --> 33:04.233
This is gonna be fun.

33:07.027 --> 33:10.114
- Where the hell are they?
- Find them! Split up!

33:10.280 --> 33:11.824
Gotta be here somewhere.

33:25.254 --> 33:26.630
Are you all right?

33:28.007 --> 33:29.091
I've been better.

33:30.217 --> 33:32.594
- Thanks for the assist.
- Likewise.

33:32.970 --> 33:33.971
Throw another move like that

33:34.138 --> 33:35.639
and you're likely to break
every bone in your arms.

33:35.806 --> 33:37.474
Yeah, I might've done that already.

33:40.310 --> 33:41.603
How many shots do you have left?

33:45.441 --> 33:46.650
Not enough.

33:49.737 --> 33:51.530
<i>It's a perfect night
for a little mayhem.</i>

33:52.031 --> 33:53.949
Wouldn't you say, Quake?

34:05.961 --> 34:07.463
We have to get out of here.

34:08.714 --> 34:11.632
You know, killing you
may not bring me peace...

34:16.889 --> 34:19.516
but it sure as hell
will feel good.

34:47.335 --> 34:48.504
I'm on fire.

34:49.338 --> 34:51.172
Well, a little more than usual.

34:58.764 --> 35:00.140
Huh.

35:05.604 --> 35:07.815
I don't know
who the hell you think you are,

35:08.273 --> 35:10.692
- but you just made a big mistake.
- Funny.

35:10.859 --> 35:13.654
I was gonna say the same thing...
without the accent.

35:13.821 --> 35:14.905
Robbie?

35:16.740 --> 35:18.659
Take the stairs, find Agent Coulson.

35:18.992 --> 35:20.202
- Coulson?
- Go.

35:39.054 --> 35:40.639
It's time to pay for your sins.

35:57.322 --> 35:58.782
Let's head back up, check it out.

36:00.826 --> 36:02.327
Not smart to fire a gun in here.

36:05.914 --> 36:07.124
That makes six.

36:07.541 --> 36:08.834
No telling how many more are around.

36:09.459 --> 36:11.170
They're like cockroaches,
these guys.

36:15.215 --> 36:16.133
Oh, Coulson.

36:16.216 --> 36:17.509
- Simmons.
- Just in time.

36:17.593 --> 36:19.428
- What the hell are you doing here?
- We came to find James.

36:19.511 --> 36:21.180
We thought he may be targeted
by the Watchdogs, but...

36:21.346 --> 36:22.472
"We"?

36:27.311 --> 36:28.687
That's exactly why we're here.

36:31.106 --> 36:32.900
His GPS signal went out,

36:33.066 --> 36:34.693
so we came
to his last recorded location

36:34.860 --> 36:36.820
and found it overrun
with these guys.

36:36.987 --> 36:38.113
Check that back room.

36:46.914 --> 36:49.541
James turned on us.
He's working with the Watchdogs.

36:49.875 --> 36:52.044
Then it's a good thing
we brought Robbie Reyes.

36:52.211 --> 36:53.420
Fight fire with fire.

36:54.588 --> 36:55.923
That's a saying, isn't it?

36:58.759 --> 37:00.093
I won't let you take me yet!

37:03.305 --> 37:05.140
I will be the last one to die.

37:17.903 --> 37:20.989
Did two fire dudes just drop into
a warehouse full of fireworks?

37:21.490 --> 37:22.783
You had to see that coming.

37:23.325 --> 37:25.327
Let's go! Go, go, go!

37:57.526 --> 37:58.819
You said alive, right?

38:31.351 --> 38:34.771
Thank you for saving
Simmons and I back there.

38:36.732 --> 38:37.858
You're welcome.

38:39.651 --> 38:42.029
Are you gonna say anything else?

38:42.529 --> 38:45.407
Nothing else to say.
I'm just glad you're safe.

38:49.828 --> 38:52.289
- The Watchdogs are...
- The Watchdogs took a hit.

38:52.372 --> 38:53.332
They continue to be a threat,

38:53.415 --> 38:55.292
but we have to put them
on the back burner for now.

38:55.375 --> 38:56.585
They're not gonna stop
just because we...

38:56.668 --> 38:58.045
We have a more pressing
threat on our hands.

38:58.128 --> 38:59.921
Sorry, but for me,
nothing is more pressing than...

39:00.088 --> 39:01.465
Look, I know you two
like to work alone,

39:02.132 --> 39:03.884
settling the scores
that are personal to you,

39:04.176 --> 39:05.719
but that's not how we work here
at S.H.I.E.L.D.

39:06.303 --> 39:08.513
We work together
to keep everyone safe.

39:09.097 --> 39:10.640
From things like this.

39:13.727 --> 39:15.312
Is that the book my uncle
was talking about?

39:15.479 --> 39:16.563
I think so.

39:17.439 --> 39:19.483
- Well, you know where to find it?
- No one ever has.

39:19.649 --> 39:22.235
Not Daniel Whitehall,
not the Red Skull,

39:22.402 --> 39:24.029
not even Nick Fury himself.

39:27.157 --> 39:29.743
He's an old friend,
sort of a mentor, really.

39:30.202 --> 39:31.745
But they all went looking for it.

39:31.912 --> 39:33.413
It's called the Darkhold.

39:34.122 --> 39:36.124
It's been referred to
as a book of sins,

39:36.291 --> 39:39.252
a book of spells,
infinite knowledge.

39:39.920 --> 39:43.173
I don't know what it is, but I do know
that it's in all of our best interests

39:43.340 --> 39:44.800
to keep it out of the wrong hands.

39:45.300 --> 39:47.260
That shipment you were tracking
in Los Angeles.

39:47.469 --> 39:48.553
Yeah, I thought it was a weapon.

39:48.720 --> 39:50.806
- In the form of a person.
- Lucy Bauer.

39:50.972 --> 39:54.226
Who your uncle said was playing God.
Now she's after it.

39:54.393 --> 39:55.519
So you may want to be solo,

39:55.602 --> 39:57.562
but forces beyond our control
are driving us together.

39:59.439 --> 40:02.359
You don't need us? Fine.
Right now, we need you.

40:10.367 --> 40:11.743
Do you have any idea where to start?

40:11.910 --> 40:13.370
Joseph Bauer,

40:13.537 --> 40:15.664
the man Robbie's uncle said
was at the centre of all this,

40:16.373 --> 40:17.958
he's been in a coma all these years.

40:19.793 --> 40:21.545
Well, he just woke up.

40:27.634 --> 40:30.470
I would like to thank you again,
Agent May, for all your help.

40:30.637 --> 40:32.097
Yeah, we know the tests

40:32.180 --> 40:34.224
were obnoxious enough
to make you want to hit someone.

40:34.391 --> 40:36.017
Just glad that person wasn't me.

40:38.854 --> 40:40.856
- Need a lift?
- Desperately.

40:41.356 --> 40:42.983
It's good to see you back
in fighting form.

40:43.150 --> 40:45.026
- Dying takes a lot out of you.
- I've heard.

40:45.193 --> 40:46.820
We should start a club,
get some T-shirts made up.

40:46.987 --> 40:49.990
We got a problem.
I need you with me on this.

40:50.157 --> 40:51.241
You know I'm in.

40:53.493 --> 40:56.037
- Thank you for your help.
- It was my pleasure, Agent May.

40:56.204 --> 40:58.123
I don't think we've met.
Phil Coulson.

40:58.290 --> 41:01.168
- Agent Coulson. I'm Aida.
- My assistant.

41:03.503 --> 41:05.797
How long have you been lending a hand
to our friend Dr Radcliffe?

41:05.964 --> 41:07.674
Since he gave me hands.

41:12.554 --> 41:16.016
Wow. Impeccable work.
I'm a fellow amputee.

41:17.100 --> 41:18.602
What happened,
if you don't mind me asking?

41:19.102 --> 41:21.313
Not at all. I've actually
been this way since birth.

41:21.980 --> 41:24.483
Thank God for Dr Radcliffe
and Dr Fitz's work.

41:24.649 --> 41:26.526
- Couldn't agree more.
- Hey.

41:27.194 --> 41:29.070
Now I see why you've been spending
so much time here.

41:29.237 --> 41:30.405
What?

41:30.989 --> 41:34.910
- Aida. She's beautiful.
- Is she?

41:35.368 --> 41:37.787
Ah, yeah, she is all right, I guess.
I prefer a classical beauty myself.

41:37.954 --> 41:41.166
She's so real.
Her conversational responses,

41:41.500 --> 41:42.834
her range of motion...

41:44.211 --> 41:45.921
Those are weird things
to say about a person.

41:46.296 --> 41:47.589
Fitz, she's an android.

41:49.841 --> 41:51.176
You do know she's an android, right?

41:51.343 --> 41:53.178
Yeah, of course,
I know that she's an android,

41:53.345 --> 41:54.304
because I helped out.

41:54.471 --> 41:56.515
Why do you think her dynamic
reaction force is so low?

41:56.681 --> 41:58.558
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Well, I wanted to.

41:58.725 --> 42:00.227
Obviously,
you can't tell the new director,

42:00.393 --> 42:02.312
and what with your lie-detector
tests becoming more frequent,

42:02.395 --> 42:04.481
who knows the next time they're
gonna call you in and then...

42:04.564 --> 42:07.067
Tomorrow. It's tomorrow.

42:07.567 --> 42:08.818
Well, that's not good.

42:12.614 --> 42:14.574
This is one lie
you're gonna have to tell.

42:20.372 --> 42:22.165
Actually, I'll have a few.
