00:50.917 --> 00:53.010
Grimesby!

00:53.086 --> 00:54.519
Get out here, you rat bastard!

00:54.587 --> 00:57.112
You know why I'm here.
Come and face me like a man!

00:57.190 --> 00:59.215
Grimesby, Roderick Grimesby!

00:59.292 --> 01:01.556
You don't take favors
with a man's wife

01:01.628 --> 01:02.856
and not answer for it!

01:02.929 --> 01:05.762
By the faith Jesus, that hurts.

01:06.466 --> 01:10.095
Ah, there's you done for,
Roddy boy.

01:20.647 --> 01:22.012
What have we here?

01:22.082 --> 01:23.811
Roderick "Roddy" Grimesby.

01:23.883 --> 01:24.815
45.

01:24.884 --> 01:27.045
Part-time dock worker,
full-time drunk,

01:27.120 --> 01:28.178
according to the neighbors.

01:28.254 --> 01:31.451
Alcoholic drinks himself
to death, not that unusual.

01:31.524 --> 01:32.616
Why was I called?

01:32.692 --> 01:34.489
Cause of death is still unknown,
Detective.

01:34.561 --> 01:37.155
Quite right, Doctor.
Have you a time of death?

01:37.230 --> 01:39.960
Between 4:00 and 5:00 a.m.
this morning.

01:40.033 --> 01:41.728
Very good.

01:41.801 --> 01:45.293
George, this, uh, Stanley Paulk,
the man who found the body,

01:45.371 --> 01:46.338
why was he here?

01:46.406 --> 01:48.431
He came seeking satisfaction,
sir.

01:48.508 --> 01:49.532
I beg your pardon.

01:49.609 --> 01:53.409
For his wife's liaisons
with the deceased here.

01:53.480 --> 01:55.573
Ah, thus the broken-down door.

01:55.648 --> 01:56.842
I'd like to have a word
with him, George.

01:56.916 --> 01:58.383
Sir.

02:01.888 --> 02:04.857
The tongue and throat
are swollen and burned.

02:04.924 --> 02:07.984
Strong aroma.
Some kind of paint product.

02:08.061 --> 02:08.993
Varnish?

02:09.062 --> 02:11.292
Surely, he would have known
it would be fatal.

02:11.364 --> 02:12.922
Perhaps that was the point.

02:12.999 --> 02:15.399
Suicide? I don't think so.
Look here.

02:15.468 --> 02:18.301
This bruising, it's recent.

02:18.371 --> 02:19.838
He was held down.

02:21.541 --> 02:22.599
By the shape of it,

02:22.675 --> 02:25.576
I would say the attacker
was right-handed.

02:25.645 --> 02:27.203
Then he poured varnish
down his throat?

02:27.280 --> 02:29.043
Murder.

02:30.817 --> 02:32.842
Detective, Stanley Paulk.

02:32.919 --> 02:34.648
There he is,
the stinking pile of sheep...

02:34.721 --> 02:36.416
Mr. Paulk,
I'm Detective William Murdoch.

02:36.489 --> 02:39.424
I take it the door was locked
when you arrived, Mr. Paulk.

02:39.492 --> 02:41.619
I didn't crack my shoulder
for exercise.

02:41.694 --> 02:43.525
No, I guess not.

02:43.596 --> 02:45.120
And when you broke down
the door,

02:45.198 --> 02:46.665
this is how you found
Mr. Grimesby?

02:46.733 --> 02:47.757
Facedown in his own filth.

02:47.834 --> 02:49.768
Fitting, I'd say.

02:49.836 --> 02:51.963
Do you know of anyone who might
have wanted to harm him?

02:52.038 --> 02:53.699
You don't have time to hear
the whole list.

02:53.773 --> 02:54.967
And where was Mrs. Paulk
last night?

02:55.041 --> 02:55.973
Home.

02:56.042 --> 02:58.033
I don't let the tramp
out of my sight these days.

02:58.111 --> 03:00.136
If your wife was safely at home,

03:00.213 --> 03:03.205
then why did you choose last
night to confront Mr. Grimesby?

03:03.283 --> 03:05.183
It was time to settle the score,
once and for all.

03:05.251 --> 03:07.014
I guess he settled it for me.

03:07.086 --> 03:10.317
Did you know
the Grimesby family?

03:10.390 --> 03:12.051
We've been neighbors
almost 15 years.

03:12.125 --> 03:13.092
Turns out for half of them,

03:13.159 --> 03:14.592
he was having at it
with my missus.

03:14.661 --> 03:15.650
Yes, thank you, Mr. Paulk.

03:15.728 --> 03:17.457
Do you know
where the family is now?

03:17.530 --> 03:19.521
Wife's been dead 15 years.

03:19.599 --> 03:20.531
And the boy?

03:20.600 --> 03:22.363
Harcourt.
Odd one, that.

03:22.435 --> 03:24.130
But he did all right
by the old man.

03:24.204 --> 03:25.136
Meaning?

03:25.205 --> 03:27.173
Regular visits, food, and so on.

03:27.240 --> 03:29.470
Drunken bugger
didn't deserve the care.

03:29.542 --> 03:31.032
It's by rights
he's dead and cold.

03:31.110 --> 03:32.202
Thank you.

03:32.278 --> 03:33.711
Constable, see to it

03:33.780 --> 03:36.806
that Mr. Paulk receives
medical attention.

03:36.883 --> 03:38.817
Sir.

03:39.752 --> 03:41.913
Sir, do you really
want to let him go?

03:41.988 --> 03:43.649
I mean, the cheated-on husband?

03:43.723 --> 03:46.749
George,
the attacker was right-handed.

03:46.826 --> 03:49.056
He's still here.

03:49.629 --> 03:52.154
He's still here.

04:05.478 --> 04:07.810
He's still here.

04:11.784 --> 04:13.115
By Jesus, that's him.

04:13.186 --> 04:15.814
- Who?
- Harcourt. The son.

04:18.024 --> 04:20.288
Ask me. Ask me.

04:20.360 --> 04:22.055
Harcourt killed his own father!

04:24.097 --> 04:25.689
How do you like them apples?

04:36.342 --> 04:37.809
Hey!

04:37.877 --> 04:40.402
What's your name, copper?

04:40.480 --> 04:44.314
Constable Crabby or something?
Eh?

04:44.384 --> 04:47.751
Ooh, what's the matter?

04:47.820 --> 04:50.983
You don't like wooden people,
Crabby?

04:51.057 --> 04:52.718
That's quite enough from you.

04:52.792 --> 04:54.191
Thought so.

04:54.260 --> 04:59.527
Now, this Detective Murdoch,
serious fellow.

04:59.599 --> 05:00.588
Thoughtful, clever.

05:00.667 --> 05:03.295
Mr. Grimesby, if you could
just sign this confession,

05:03.369 --> 05:04.495
if you don't mind.

05:04.570 --> 05:07.698
That coroner's not too shabby,
either.

05:07.774 --> 05:11.335
Willowy.
I like that.

05:11.411 --> 05:12.343
She married?

05:12.412 --> 05:13.470
Okay, that's quite enough.

05:13.546 --> 05:15.343
No!
Don't.

05:15.415 --> 05:17.508
He stays with me.

05:28.895 --> 05:29.919
Everything all right, Constable?

05:29.996 --> 05:30.963
Fine, sir.

05:31.030 --> 05:33.055
Well, that'll be
the written confession, then.

05:33.132 --> 05:34.793
Why would a man
who's clearly right-handed

05:34.867 --> 05:35.799
write with his left hand?

05:35.868 --> 05:37.392
Because he's as mad
as a box of frogs.

05:37.470 --> 05:40.268
I'll wait for the postmortem
report before I speak with him.

05:40.340 --> 05:42.501
A confession's not good enough.

05:42.575 --> 05:45.203
Now, you tell me
who the madman is...

05:45.278 --> 05:49.271
Crabby.

05:58.124 --> 06:00.718
Good timing, William.
I've opened Mr. Grimesby up.

06:00.793 --> 06:02.624
Excruciating death,
I should think.

06:02.695 --> 06:04.094
Someone wanted him to suffer,

06:04.163 --> 06:06.563
perhaps suggesting
a personal motive.

06:06.632 --> 06:10.033
Yes, well,
Harcourt was a drunkard's son.

06:10.103 --> 06:11.866
Then you, of all people,
should understand the motive.

06:11.938 --> 06:14.429
I suppose so.

06:14.507 --> 06:16.236
You sound unconvinced.

06:16.309 --> 06:18.903
Well, for years,
Harcourt played the good son,

06:18.978 --> 06:20.775
caring
for an undeserving father.

06:20.847 --> 06:22.041
Why choose now to kill?

06:22.115 --> 06:23.241
Maybe he'd simply had enough.

06:23.316 --> 06:25.614
I suppose.
What about the eyes?

06:25.685 --> 06:27.448
One dark, one light.

06:27.520 --> 06:29.988
Condition called heterochromia.
Usually a genetic phenomenon.

06:30.056 --> 06:32.320
Oh, genetics.
Heady stuff.

06:32.392 --> 06:33.416
I read Gregor Mendel's

06:33.493 --> 06:35.290
"Experiments
in Plant Hybridization"

06:35.361 --> 06:36.419
last July at the beach.

06:36.496 --> 06:38.521
For some light summer reading.

06:38.598 --> 06:40.259
Yes.

06:42.435 --> 06:44.460
I'll need a sample
of the stomach contents

06:44.537 --> 06:46.266
to verify the poisoning
by varnish.

06:46.339 --> 06:48.330
A mystery under every rock,
eh, William?

06:48.408 --> 06:50.399
Yes.

06:55.148 --> 06:58.845
George, I'd like you
to bring in Mrs. Paulk.

06:58.918 --> 07:00.681
But Harcourt Grimesby
has just written a confession.

07:00.753 --> 07:01.685
Yes, I understand.

07:01.754 --> 07:03.722
However, there are still
some unanswered questions,

07:03.790 --> 07:07.226
and given Mrs. Paulk's alleged
relationship with the deceased,

07:07.293 --> 07:08.726
I believe she might be
able to answer them.

07:08.795 --> 07:10.285
- I'll bring her in straightaway.
- Thank you.

07:10.363 --> 07:12.854
Oh, and, George,
how are things with the puppet?

07:12.932 --> 07:16.390
It stares at me, sir,
like it knows what I'm thinking.

07:16.469 --> 07:18.130
And it's always grinning
this grin.

07:18.204 --> 07:19.796
Basswood and wires, Constable.

07:19.872 --> 07:21.169
Murdoch, a word.

07:21.240 --> 07:22.935
And when you pull
a puppet's strings...

07:23.009 --> 07:25.068
Sir, if this is about
the Grimesby case...

07:25.144 --> 07:27.806
Don't talk to me about that
nutcase and his demon puppet.

07:27.880 --> 07:31.316
A friend of ours has dropped by
for a visit.

07:31.384 --> 07:32.544
William.

07:32.618 --> 07:35.052
Hail fellow, well met.

07:35.121 --> 07:36.520
Mr. Doyle.

07:36.589 --> 07:38.352
I am delighted to see you.

07:38.424 --> 07:40.619
And it's Arthur, please.

07:40.693 --> 07:42.251
My God, you're looking fit.

07:42.328 --> 07:44.922
Thomas, have you shared my news
with our detective?

07:44.997 --> 07:46.521
I thought I'd leave that to you,
Arthur.

07:46.599 --> 07:47.531
My office.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.761
- News?
- Brace yourself, William.

07:49.836 --> 07:52.270
For I have decided
to base my next creation,

07:52.338 --> 07:54.203
my next great detective, on you.

07:54.273 --> 07:55.205
Me?

07:55.274 --> 07:57.970
Well, not you precisely,
but a character very similar.

07:58.044 --> 07:59.238
A colonial detective.

07:59.312 --> 08:02.145
New World meets Old World,
science meets sleuthing.

08:02.215 --> 08:04.410
But I thought you were basing
your next Sherlock Holmes' novel

08:04.484 --> 08:05.451
on the inspector's idea

08:05.518 --> 08:07.008
of the vicious hound
that kills the man

08:07.086 --> 08:08.018
in the Scottish Highlands.

08:08.087 --> 08:09.611
Much more compelling,
I should think.

08:09.689 --> 08:10.986
Yes, and I just may someday.

08:11.057 --> 08:12.991
But, unfortunately,
Mr. Holmes and I remain

08:13.059 --> 08:14.083
at tiresome loggerheads.

08:14.160 --> 08:16.822
You are the fresh blood
needed to fire my imagination.

08:16.896 --> 08:18.454
But I'm working
on a case currently.

08:18.531 --> 08:19.463
Oh, nonsense.

08:19.532 --> 08:21.557
The inspector tells me
you already have a confession.

08:21.634 --> 08:22.658
True.

08:22.735 --> 08:24.965
However, this case
is more complicated

08:25.037 --> 08:26.800
than we had originally thought.

08:26.873 --> 08:28.033
That's the first
I've heard of this.

08:28.107 --> 08:29.938
I'll hardly be any bother
at all.

08:30.009 --> 08:32.169
I've already decided
that I will use a real-life case

08:32.245 --> 08:33.371
as the basis of my story.

08:33.446 --> 08:36.414
I merely require you to guide me
through your process.

08:36.482 --> 08:40.350
And allow me, on occasion,
to observe your methodology.

08:40.419 --> 08:42.216
What say you?

08:42.288 --> 08:44.552
Do you really think that people
are interested in reading

08:44.624 --> 08:46.615
about investigations
that are over and done with?

08:46.692 --> 08:48.319
Cold cases, if you will.

08:48.394 --> 08:49.622
Yes, I do.

08:49.695 --> 08:51.560
So much so that I believe
that my little idea

08:51.631 --> 08:54.600
will generate a lot of publicity
for this station house.

08:54.667 --> 08:57.363
Then, again, of course,
fame can be such a nuisance.

08:57.436 --> 09:00.564
Murdoch, on second thought,
what would be the harm, really?

09:00.640 --> 09:01.902
Sir, with all due respect, I...

09:01.974 --> 09:04.204
And what better case to let
Arthur Conan Doyle observe

09:04.277 --> 09:06.040
than one that's already solved?

09:06.112 --> 09:07.670
Impress him with your usual zeal

09:07.747 --> 09:10.443
to see that even the scoundrels,
the obviously guilty,

09:10.516 --> 09:12.211
get a fair crack at the whip.

09:12.285 --> 09:14.583
Explore any wild theories
you like, Murdoch.

09:14.654 --> 09:18.090
As long as you arrive
at the foregone conclusion.

09:18.157 --> 09:21.024
Arthur, you have
our full cooperation.

09:32.572 --> 09:33.834
Give me some soup.

09:33.906 --> 09:35.237
No.
It's for me.

09:35.308 --> 09:37.776
Cream of celery is my favorite.

09:37.843 --> 09:40.676
Everything is your favorite.

09:40.746 --> 09:43.772
If you don't feed me,
I could get upset.

09:43.849 --> 09:45.680
You don't want that.

09:45.751 --> 09:48.914
I need food.
You're made of wood.

09:48.988 --> 09:51.650
Wood doesn't get hungry?

09:52.925 --> 09:54.290
Where shall we begin, Detective?

09:54.360 --> 09:56.055
Perhaps with the interrogation
of your suspect.

09:56.128 --> 09:57.459
That would be improper,
I'm afraid.

09:57.530 --> 09:59.395
Oh, then, I suppose I'll
just dive into the research

09:59.465 --> 10:00.432
on my cold case.

10:00.499 --> 10:01.727
Which case would that be?

10:01.801 --> 10:03.598
It's the death
of an elderly Chinese gentleman

10:03.669 --> 10:04.601
this March 22nd.

10:04.670 --> 10:06.297
I read about the trial
when I was last here.

10:06.372 --> 10:07.396
It stayed with me ever since.

10:07.473 --> 10:09.065
I believe you're referring
to the Lee case.

10:09.141 --> 10:10.301
Precisely.

10:10.376 --> 10:12.708
As I recall, the victim
was beaten to death.

10:12.778 --> 10:13.710
An open and shut case.

10:13.779 --> 10:15.303
Why would it be of interest
to you?

10:15.381 --> 10:17.906
The Chinese community
is an exotic backdrop.

10:17.984 --> 10:20.817
Now, how would you handle
this case, Detective?

10:20.886 --> 10:23.286
I would visit the crime scene.

10:23.356 --> 10:25.722
Long gone, unfortunately.
Next.

10:25.791 --> 10:27.986
- Speak to the witnesses.
- Presumably in the files.

10:28.060 --> 10:29.459
Could you arrange for me
to see them?

10:29.528 --> 10:31.723
Yes, I'll have
Constable Crabtree see to it.

10:31.797 --> 10:33.128
Next step?

10:33.199 --> 10:36.532
I would speak to the doctor
that conducted the postmortem.

10:36.602 --> 10:38.035
Ah, the lovely Dr. Ogden.

10:38.104 --> 10:39.935
Yes, it will be a great pleasure
to see her again.

10:40.006 --> 10:41.530
You'll soon have your chance.

10:41.607 --> 10:43.837
William, I have a...

10:43.909 --> 10:46.377
Mr. Doyle,
what a lovely surprise.

10:46.445 --> 10:48.811
Dr. Ogden.
Enchanting as always.

10:48.881 --> 10:51.247
I wonder
if I might speak with you.

10:51.317 --> 10:52.682
Speak with me?

10:52.752 --> 10:55.050
Yes. I'm conducting research
on my new book,

10:55.121 --> 10:57.214
partially inspired
by Detective Murdoch.

10:57.289 --> 10:58.221
A most intriguing idea.

10:58.290 --> 10:59.814
Yes, I'd like to discuss
some details

10:59.892 --> 11:01.553
surrounding a postmortem,

11:01.627 --> 11:03.561
and perhaps you might also
enlighten me

11:03.629 --> 11:05.961
on some of our good detective's
personal habits.

11:07.166 --> 11:09.396
Certainly.
When would be convenient?

11:09.468 --> 11:10.662
Now's as good a time as any.

11:10.736 --> 11:13.102
Unfortunately, Mr. Doyle
is unavailable at the moment.

11:13.172 --> 11:15.299
He'll be observing my interview
with Harcourt Grimesby.

11:15.374 --> 11:18.639
I will? Splendid.
Perhaps later.

11:18.711 --> 11:20.008
Are you fond of French cuisine?

11:20.079 --> 11:22.172
There are no French restaurants
in Toronto.

11:22.248 --> 11:23.681
Perhaps something else, then.

11:23.749 --> 11:24.841
I would love to.

11:24.917 --> 11:28.284
I'd be more than happy to answer
any questions you might have.

11:28.354 --> 11:31.016
I would prefer to discuss
the victim's stomach contents.

11:31.090 --> 11:33.718
That's hardly
a suitable dinner topic.

11:33.793 --> 11:35.420
He means this, Mr. Doyle.

11:35.494 --> 11:38.657
Ah, yes, well, perhaps
it is best we dine later.

11:38.731 --> 11:41.666
I must be off.
Gentlemen.

11:53.245 --> 11:55.270
Oh, a belly speaker, no less.

11:55.347 --> 11:57.838
From the ancient Greek
Baal Obh,

11:57.917 --> 11:59.043
meaning spirit voices

11:59.118 --> 12:01.416
emanating from
the ventriloquist's stomach.

12:01.487 --> 12:03.216
Thank you.

12:03.289 --> 12:06.053
Meet Harcourt Grimesby
and Mycroft.

12:06.125 --> 12:08.025
A name
I'm all too familiar with.

12:08.094 --> 12:10.426
I saw Fred Russell
and his puppet Joe

12:10.496 --> 12:11.827
at the Palace Theatre.

12:11.897 --> 12:15.389
Previously, they'd all used
hand puppets or small dolls.

12:15.468 --> 12:17.766
That night, Russell introduced
the single figure puppet

12:17.837 --> 12:18.769
like Mycroft.

12:18.838 --> 12:19.896
Caused a sensation.

12:19.972 --> 12:21.462
Now, of course,
everyone's using it.

12:21.540 --> 12:23.064
Yes, well,
the entertainment industry

12:23.142 --> 12:25.508
isn't exactly known
for its originality, now, is it?

12:25.578 --> 12:27.978
Precisely my sentiments.

12:28.047 --> 12:30.174
What sort of approach
do you intend on taking

12:30.249 --> 12:31.614
in this interview, Detective?

12:31.684 --> 12:33.515
I thought I'd talk to him.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.554
Somewhat banal,
but effective, I'm sure.

12:35.621 --> 12:37.350
Yes, I must ask that you remain
out here, please.

12:37.423 --> 12:38.355
No interruptions.

12:38.424 --> 12:41.052
Oh, no, you have my word.

12:44.330 --> 12:46.855
Thank you, George.
You may step out.

12:46.932 --> 12:49.457
Thank you, sir.

12:52.404 --> 12:54.702
Good afternoon,
Detective Murdoch.

12:54.774 --> 12:57.402
So good of you to drop by.

12:57.476 --> 12:59.535
I'm sorry to have kept you
waiting, Mr. Grimesby.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.477
Any audience is a good audience.

13:01.547 --> 13:03.913
Oh, watch this, Willy boy!

13:03.983 --> 13:06.508
Whoo, whoo, whoo,
whoo, whoo, whoo!

13:08.420 --> 13:09.648
Thanks.

13:09.722 --> 13:13.590
So, Detective,
what's on your mind?

13:13.659 --> 13:16.355
Oh, there are
a great many things on my mind.

13:16.428 --> 13:18.020
A great many things.

13:18.097 --> 13:21.692
Ooh, things aren't looking good
for you.

13:21.767 --> 13:24.258
Not good at all.

13:33.045 --> 13:35.013
I don't understand
these questions.

13:35.080 --> 13:37.241
My father was a violent,
drunken terror

13:37.316 --> 13:38.578
who drove my mother to suicide.

13:38.651 --> 13:40.619
- What more do you need to know?
- Please bear with me.

13:40.686 --> 13:42.313
This is strictly
for our records,

13:42.388 --> 13:43.582
and establishing a timeline

13:43.656 --> 13:45.123
would be a great help
in that regard.

13:45.191 --> 13:47.455
Ooh! Ask me.
I know!

13:47.526 --> 13:50.017
Please, sir.
I will have the puppet removed.

13:50.095 --> 13:52.620
No, please.
He'll be good.

13:52.698 --> 13:53.858
I really must insist.

13:53.933 --> 13:55.867
Otherwise...

13:57.002 --> 13:58.560
Pardon me.

14:03.075 --> 14:04.667
What is it, Mr. Doyle?

14:04.743 --> 14:07.143
Brilliant strategy, threatening
to take away the puppet.

14:07.213 --> 14:08.805
It wasn't strategy.

14:08.881 --> 14:10.473
The puppet
is extremely annoying.

14:10.549 --> 14:14.576
Ah, well, then, yes, straight
back at it, then, I suppose.

14:14.653 --> 14:17.247
Off you go.
Go on.

14:19.158 --> 14:22.025
Pardon the interruption.

14:22.094 --> 14:23.152
We were discussing the events

14:23.229 --> 14:24.821
leading up to the death
of your father.

14:27.399 --> 14:31.335
Mycroft and I had just finished
our performance...

14:31.403 --> 14:32.995
prematurely.

14:33.072 --> 14:35.040
The little girl's songbird
escapes and is killed.

14:35.107 --> 14:37.701
- She's compelled to bury it.
- Yeah?

14:37.776 --> 14:39.744
But she's digging a big hole.

14:39.812 --> 14:40.938
And the woman next door says,

14:41.013 --> 14:44.278
"Dearie, why such a big hole
for your wee songbird? "

14:44.350 --> 14:45.408
And the little girl says...

14:45.484 --> 14:48.044
I needed room for your damn cat!

14:49.788 --> 14:52.188
Don't you get it?
The cat ate the bird.

14:52.258 --> 14:54.522
So, okay, just stop that!

14:56.395 --> 14:59.387
Then I went home
and drank to excess.

14:59.465 --> 15:02.696
And that's when the rage
against your father took hold?

15:02.768 --> 15:04.702
Yes.

15:04.770 --> 15:06.829
I set out for my father's flat,

15:06.906 --> 15:12.139
and that's all I remember
until the end.

15:12.711 --> 15:15.612
If, as you claimed,
you despised your...

15:25.858 --> 15:27.621
You gave me your word,
Mr. Doyle.

15:27.693 --> 15:29.957
Yes, but is it not unusual
that Harcourt,

15:30.029 --> 15:32.725
if he was so hell-bent on murder
as he says he was,

15:32.798 --> 15:35.323
that he brought
his puppet along?

15:35.401 --> 15:38.564
I don't know.
Why don't you ask him yourself?

15:38.637 --> 15:40.229
- That would be improper.
- Yes, highly.

15:40.306 --> 15:41.364
But I'm afraid it may be

15:41.440 --> 15:43.237
the only way I can get
this interview.

15:43.309 --> 15:45.800
- Be my guest.
- If you insist.

15:45.878 --> 15:48.403
Who's the walrus?

15:48.480 --> 15:49.811
Arthur Conan Doyle.

15:49.882 --> 15:52.783
That supposed to mean something?

15:52.851 --> 15:55.479
Mr. Doyle is here
to lend his expertise.

15:55.554 --> 15:57.784
Oh, he's an expert.

15:57.856 --> 15:59.687
I'm curious, Mr. Grimesby,

15:59.758 --> 16:01.282
on why you brought
your puppet along

16:01.360 --> 16:02.850
if you intended to murder
your father.

16:02.928 --> 16:03.758
What are ya?
Stupid?

16:03.829 --> 16:05.057
Of course I brought him along.

16:05.130 --> 16:08.224
You don't leave your best friend
alone in the dead of night.

16:08.300 --> 16:09.858
And, yes, I know he's a puppet.

16:09.935 --> 16:12.165
We don't like you, Doyle.

16:12.237 --> 16:15.729
I take it you made Mycroft
yourself, Mr. Grimesby?

16:15.808 --> 16:17.833
Excellent craftsmanship.

16:17.910 --> 16:19.434
You should see my good side.

16:19.511 --> 16:20.944
Thank you, Detective.

16:21.013 --> 16:23.208
He looks very much like you.

16:23.282 --> 16:26.740
- It gets the laughs.
- Says you.

16:26.819 --> 16:28.616
One more thing.

16:28.687 --> 16:31.884
If your father was
a vile drunkard, as you say,

16:31.957 --> 16:33.447
why have anything to do with him
at all?

16:33.525 --> 16:36.392
I'm an only child, Detective.

16:36.462 --> 16:38.487
Regardless of my feelings
towards him,

16:38.564 --> 16:41.397
a son has a duty to his father.

16:42.801 --> 16:45.599
Yes, well, that'll be all.

16:47.439 --> 16:50.567
Oh, you're right-handed,
I take it.

16:50.642 --> 16:53.543
Yet you employ your left hand
almost exclusively.

16:53.612 --> 16:55.546
To protect my right hand.

16:55.614 --> 16:59.675
Operating Mycroft has caused
pain and numbness in it.

16:59.752 --> 17:02.414
If I'm not careful, my days
on stage may soon be over.

17:02.488 --> 17:05.480
Big parade on that day.

17:05.557 --> 17:07.718
What am I saying?
I'm for the noose.

17:07.792 --> 17:10.454
They can hack off both my hands,
and it's all the same.

17:20.539 --> 17:23.508
Might he be angling
for an insanity defense?

17:23.575 --> 17:25.270
Spare himself the noose.

17:25.344 --> 17:27.868
And guarantee a wretched life
in an asylum?

17:27.945 --> 17:30.847
Well, you were even throughout.
Never judgmental.

17:30.916 --> 17:32.440
You praised the accused.

17:32.518 --> 17:35.351
Do you pity the doomed?

17:35.421 --> 17:39.050
A fragile psyche like Harcourt's
requires a delicate approach.

17:39.124 --> 17:42.423
He seemed uncomfortable
in his own skin, didn't he?

17:42.494 --> 17:44.519
Mind you, I suspect I'd feel
the same way

17:44.596 --> 17:48.692
were I constantly barraged
with insults by my own puppet.

17:48.767 --> 17:51.827
There does seem to be no love
lost on the puppet's part.

17:51.904 --> 17:53.838
What are you suggesting?

17:53.906 --> 17:55.931
Merely an observation.

17:56.008 --> 17:58.909
He claims that his right hand
pains him with numbness,

17:58.977 --> 18:03.607
yet the killer used the right
hand to hold the victim down.

18:09.588 --> 18:11.852
No.
He wouldn't do that.

18:42.287 --> 18:45.313
And in a drunken rage,
he thought to lock the door.

18:45.390 --> 18:46.618
The Lee murder file, Mr. Doyle.

18:46.692 --> 18:48.250
Yes, thank you very much,
Constable.

18:48.327 --> 18:49.817
I don't know
why you're interested

18:49.895 --> 18:50.862
in this particular case.

18:50.929 --> 18:53.921
It's rather open and shut.
No secret panels or whatnot.

18:53.999 --> 18:56.763
The suspect, Mr. Sing,
is he incarcerated?

18:56.835 --> 18:59.065
He is.
Awaiting the noose, I believe.

18:59.138 --> 19:00.435
Unfortunate.

19:00.506 --> 19:01.996
I suppose for him.

19:02.074 --> 19:04.440
Although he was found
standing over the deceased.

19:04.510 --> 19:05.442
Was he?

19:05.511 --> 19:07.536
Yes. The other tenants
in the rooming house

19:07.613 --> 19:08.875
heard the victim moaning
in distress

19:08.947 --> 19:10.812
and the police were called.

19:11.383 --> 19:13.681
Could you find out for me
where he's being held?

19:13.752 --> 19:14.980
Right away.

19:15.053 --> 19:16.213
Um, I think it's quite something

19:16.288 --> 19:18.313
that you're basing your new
novel on Detective Murdoch.

19:18.390 --> 19:20.984
He's got an uncanny grasp
of the criminal mind

19:21.059 --> 19:23.289
and just an unbelievably
observational eye.

19:23.362 --> 19:26.195
Yes, you see, all these
platitudes are well and good,

19:26.265 --> 19:29.132
but what I really need to know
is how he thinks.

19:29.201 --> 19:30.930
Platitudes.

19:31.003 --> 19:33.733
Sounds like you're talking
about a sea creature, sir.

19:33.805 --> 19:36.069
Yes, I believe that you're
thinking of the platypus.

19:36.141 --> 19:37.165
I don't believe I am.

19:37.242 --> 19:39.005
George,
has Mrs. Paulk arrived yet?

19:39.077 --> 19:40.567
She has.
She's in the interview room.

19:40.646 --> 19:41.578
Very good.

19:41.647 --> 19:44.138
Now, go immediately
to Harcourt's flat.

19:44.216 --> 19:46.411
Retrieve any and all bottles
of shellac, varnish, lacquer,

19:46.485 --> 19:47.417
anything of the sort.

19:47.486 --> 19:48.783
I wish to compare their contents

19:48.854 --> 19:51.152
to what we find in Roderick
Grimesby's stomach sample.

19:51.223 --> 19:53.123
Now, sir, we have found
a bottle of varnish

19:53.192 --> 19:54.250
there at the crime scene.

19:54.326 --> 19:56.226
Yes, but someone took the time
to pour the varnish

19:56.295 --> 19:57.455
from a can into a bottle.

19:57.529 --> 20:00.293
So, if we find that same varnish
at Harcourt's,

20:00.365 --> 20:01.889
it furthers our case.

20:01.967 --> 20:03.764
The only thing is I was
about to help Mr. Doyle find...

20:03.835 --> 20:05.302
I'm sure it can wait.

20:05.370 --> 20:06.962
Sir.

20:07.039 --> 20:11.305
William, I sense a reluctance
on your part

20:11.376 --> 20:12.365
in this endeavor of mine.

20:12.444 --> 20:13.376
Mr. Doyle...

20:13.445 --> 20:15.208
- Arthur.
- Arthur.

20:15.280 --> 20:18.113
How do I provide you
with insight into my mind?

20:18.183 --> 20:19.741
It simply works as it does.

20:19.818 --> 20:21.979
There you are, Arthur.

20:22.054 --> 20:23.954
Creative juices flowing,
I trust?

20:24.022 --> 20:25.455
All is well?

20:25.524 --> 20:26.786
Excellent.

20:26.858 --> 20:28.951
I've got a stomach that thinks
its throat's been cut.

20:29.027 --> 20:30.995
Perfect opportunity for lunch,
yes?

20:31.063 --> 20:33.497
Yes, is there ale involved,
Inspector?

20:33.565 --> 20:34.725
Is the Pope a Catholic, Arthur?

20:34.800 --> 20:37.064
Well, in that case,
I'm your man.

20:37.135 --> 20:38.067
I've also had the idea

20:38.136 --> 20:39.831
of adapting
my "Hounds of the Highlands"

20:39.905 --> 20:40.963
to one of your new stories.

20:41.039 --> 20:44.133
My character is investigating
a terrible murder

20:44.209 --> 20:45.198
over at Scarborough Cliffs.

20:45.277 --> 20:46.938
Murdoch, of course,
is assisting me.

20:47.012 --> 20:48.980
Come on,
I'll tell you on the way.

20:49.047 --> 20:52.380
Bluffs, sir.
Scarborough Bluffs.

20:52.451 --> 20:54.248
Roddy never gave me a key.

20:54.319 --> 20:56.287
'Fraid I'd get into his booze.

20:58.991 --> 21:00.549
- Would you have?
- Of course.

21:00.626 --> 21:02.116
Mrs. Paulk,
where were you this morning

21:02.194 --> 21:03.161
between 3:00 and 6:00 a.m.?

21:03.228 --> 21:04.160
Home.

21:04.229 --> 21:06.254
Me husband Stanley says
he's got the nerve up

21:06.331 --> 21:07.593
to take it to Roddy.

21:07.666 --> 21:10.863
I says, "Rubbish, you've not got
the nerve, you spineless fish,

21:10.936 --> 21:12.563
which is why
I've been flyin' me flag

21:12.638 --> 21:14.503
on account
of your girlie aspect. "

21:15.574 --> 21:17.201
And then I went back to sleep.

21:19.144 --> 21:20.771
Are you sure
this demonstration's

21:20.846 --> 21:22.006
absolutely necessary, Thomas?

21:27.919 --> 21:29.079
Note the form, Arthur.

21:29.154 --> 21:30.712
My character in battle

21:30.789 --> 21:32.120
against that ferocious hound
on the cliffs.

21:32.190 --> 21:34.658
Ah, yes, of course,
the climactic boxing match

21:34.726 --> 21:37.126
between man and dog.

21:40.899 --> 21:42.992
Fine form.
Now, what about Murdoch?

21:43.068 --> 21:45.559
I can't fathom him
one little bit.

21:45.637 --> 21:49.573
Uh, just spends half his time
sitting and thinking.

21:49.641 --> 21:52.872
But he's done well,
all because of you.

21:52.944 --> 21:54.206
Indeed, indeed.

21:54.279 --> 21:56.747
But he lacks the fighter's
instincts to turn the screws.

21:56.815 --> 21:59.648
A little fear of God
gets results.

21:59.718 --> 22:00.878
None of this "Let's sit down

22:00.952 --> 22:02.419
and have a nice, little,
friendly chat" business.

22:02.487 --> 22:04.819
Mrs. Paulk, what do you know

22:04.890 --> 22:07.518
about the relationship between
Mr. Grimesby and his son?

22:07.592 --> 22:08.957
Was there any bad blood?

22:09.027 --> 22:10.494
Haven't the faintest idea.

22:10.562 --> 22:13.292
I was there to knock boots
with Roddy boy, Mr. Murdoch.

22:13.365 --> 22:14.957
I'm not otherwise taking notice.

22:15.033 --> 22:17.058
Well, that will be quite enough.

22:17.135 --> 22:19.103
There was one odd thing.

22:19.171 --> 22:20.934
One odd thing?

22:21.006 --> 22:23.668
Every while in his cups,
Roddy'd get all teary-eyed,

22:23.742 --> 22:25.801
talk about
that godforsaken Mycroft.

22:25.877 --> 22:27.174
- The puppet?
- Yeah.

22:27.245 --> 22:28.974
Nothing you could make out.

22:29.047 --> 22:31.072
Just Mycroft this
and Mycroft that.

22:31.149 --> 22:32.639
Boohoo and all.

22:32.718 --> 22:34.208
I figure the loving's
top drawer.

22:34.286 --> 22:36.481
If the man wants to bring
puppets into it,

22:36.555 --> 22:37.920
I'm not complaining, am I?

22:45.330 --> 22:47.264
You know, I...
Thank you, good fellows.

22:47.332 --> 22:49.266
I was wondering
if I could meet the suspect

22:49.334 --> 22:50.426
in the Lee case, Mr. Sing.

22:50.502 --> 22:51.560
The suspect?

22:51.636 --> 22:52.660
Oh, yes, I find it

22:52.738 --> 22:54.205
as important to understand
the psychology of the villain

22:54.272 --> 22:55.569
as it is the hero.

22:55.640 --> 22:57.198
I suppose it can be arranged,
but I doubt you'll get much.

22:57.275 --> 22:58.207
Why?

22:58.276 --> 23:00.073
Well, my understanding is that
when they raided the flat,

23:00.145 --> 23:02.045
they found a room
full of roots and herbs.

23:02.114 --> 23:04.742
Most likely an opium eater.

23:04.816 --> 23:06.807
Yes, well, nonetheless,
if I could speak to him,

23:06.885 --> 23:08.079
I'd be in your debt.

23:08.153 --> 23:10.087
Repay me with another pint,
Arthur?

23:11.857 --> 23:12.846
Splendid.

23:15.560 --> 23:18.188
These are samples
of the varnishes found

23:18.263 --> 23:20.094
in Harcourt Grimesby's home.

23:20.999 --> 23:21.988
Methanol.

23:23.702 --> 23:25.169
Ethanol.

23:25.237 --> 23:26.670
Isopropanol.

23:26.738 --> 23:29.206
And methyl isobutyl ketone.

23:29.274 --> 23:31.105
In other words, he only used
high-quality shellac

23:31.176 --> 23:32.108
on his puppet.

23:32.177 --> 23:33.109
Yes.

23:33.178 --> 23:37.979
Now the stomach contents.

23:44.156 --> 23:46.215
That's just low-grade varnish.

23:46.291 --> 23:47.849
That would be consistent
with my findings.

23:47.926 --> 23:48.858
How so?

23:48.927 --> 23:50.326
Shellac affects
the muscular system,

23:50.395 --> 23:51.885
while varnish
causes gastric bleeding.

23:51.963 --> 23:54.261
Mr. Harcourt only suffered
gastric bleeding.

23:54.332 --> 23:58.928
So, for some reason, instead
of using the shellac on hand,

23:59.004 --> 24:01.837
Harcourt went to the trouble
of purchasing low-grade varnish

24:01.907 --> 24:03.306
with which to kill his father?

24:03.375 --> 24:04.842
Yet another inconsistency.

24:04.910 --> 24:07.743
Yes.
Yet another inconsistency.

24:08.313 --> 24:11.749
He's still there.

24:11.817 --> 24:13.182
Shut up.

24:13.251 --> 24:15.617
What did you do?

24:15.687 --> 24:17.746
What did you do?

24:17.823 --> 24:19.222
Shut up, you creature.

24:19.291 --> 24:21.521
What did you do?
What did you do?

24:21.593 --> 24:23.060
Shut up! Shut up!

24:23.128 --> 24:25.653
Shut up!

24:35.907 --> 24:38.375
What's happened to your puppet,
Mr. Grimesby?

24:38.443 --> 24:40.809
We had an altercation.

24:40.879 --> 24:42.608
Oh?
About?

24:43.915 --> 24:46.076
Mycroft has a mind of his own,
doesn't he?

24:46.151 --> 24:47.982
If I say yes, you'll
think me insane. I'm not.

24:49.788 --> 24:52.382
You and I are very much alike,
Mr. Grimesby.

24:52.457 --> 24:53.981
We are?

24:54.059 --> 24:55.185
Yes.

24:55.260 --> 24:57.125
Both our fathers were alcoholic.

24:57.195 --> 24:59.163
Our mothers died
when we were very young.

24:59.231 --> 25:01.597
And as a boy,
I, too, had an alter ego.

25:01.666 --> 25:03.793
A stuffed bear toy.

25:03.869 --> 25:05.632
What was his name?

25:07.439 --> 25:08.428
Bear.

25:09.808 --> 25:11.537
Straightforward.
Fitting.

25:11.610 --> 25:16.570
My point is that my stuffed bear
also spoke for me on occasion.

25:16.648 --> 25:18.275
He knew all of my secrets,

25:18.350 --> 25:20.978
as I suspect Mycroft knows
all of yours.

25:21.052 --> 25:24.078
May I see him?

25:31.796 --> 25:34.356
You take very good care of him,
don't you?

25:34.432 --> 25:36.992
He can be difficult,
but he means no harm.

25:37.068 --> 25:38.399
I think he likes you, Detective.

25:38.470 --> 25:40.665
He's very glossy.

25:40.739 --> 25:41.967
It's shellac, I assume.

25:42.040 --> 25:44.338
It strains the budget,
but he's worth it.

25:44.409 --> 25:46.570
Yes. Low-grade varnish
would damage the basswood.

25:46.645 --> 25:48.806
I wouldn't dream
of using the stuff.

25:48.880 --> 25:50.575
Then, how is it
your father came to be poisoned

25:50.649 --> 25:51.581
by cheap varnish?

25:51.650 --> 25:54.448
We've taken very careful note
of your father's injuries.

25:54.519 --> 25:57.079
They are not consistent
with poisoning by shellac.

25:57.155 --> 25:59.453
You must be mistaken.

25:59.524 --> 26:04.518
Why are you so determined
to hang for this crime?

26:04.596 --> 26:06.894
Let me help you.

26:15.040 --> 26:17.440
Here it is.
Haw See Lee.

26:17.509 --> 26:19.534
I know you didn't personally
perform the postmortem, Doctor,

26:19.611 --> 26:21.408
but anything you could tell me
would be most helpful.

26:21.479 --> 26:22.446
Of course, Mr. Doyle.

26:22.514 --> 26:24.038
I must say,
it seems rather routine.

26:24.115 --> 26:27.312
Yes, yes, but it is the minutiae
that is the texture of a tale.

26:27.385 --> 26:30.718
Well, the victim was found dead
in his rooming house.

26:30.789 --> 26:33.349
He had suffered extensive
bruising to the upper torso.

26:33.425 --> 26:34.653
And what was the cause of death?

26:34.726 --> 26:35.954
The victim was elderly.

26:36.027 --> 26:38.393
The beating was thought to have
contributed to heart failure.

26:38.463 --> 26:40.021
The bruising,
was it to the back?

26:40.098 --> 26:41.326
Yes.

26:41.399 --> 26:44.300
By any chance, were there
specific shapes to the bruises?

26:44.369 --> 26:47.167
Yes.
Distinct circular patterns.

26:47.238 --> 26:50.503
The examiner thought perhaps a
potato masher or a large pestle,

26:50.575 --> 26:51.940
some such item.

26:52.010 --> 26:54.137
Tell me, Mr. Doyle, how did you
know about the shape?

26:54.212 --> 26:56.407
I must have read about it
in the newspaper article.

26:56.481 --> 26:59.109
Was the victim suffering
from consumption?

27:00.018 --> 27:02.179
Mr. Doyle, you seem to know
far more about this case

27:02.253 --> 27:04.653
than what one would find
in a newspaper article.

27:04.723 --> 27:07.817
Tell me, Doctor,
have you ever heard of cupping?

27:12.964 --> 27:14.591
Always
with the blackboard, Murdoch,

27:14.666 --> 27:15.826
always with the blackboard.

27:15.900 --> 27:17.265
Must you persist?

27:17.335 --> 27:18.359
As I've said before, sir,

27:18.436 --> 27:20.165
Harcourt Grimesby
is not being truthful.

27:20.238 --> 27:22.331
He claims to have killed
his father with shellac,

27:22.407 --> 27:24.102
yet the poison used
was a cheaper varnish.

27:24.175 --> 27:25.107
- A quibble.
- A lie.

27:25.176 --> 27:26.643
I reiterate, he confessed.

27:26.711 --> 27:28.235
- But why?
- He's guilty.

27:28.313 --> 27:30.008
- Of what?
- Killing his father?

27:30.081 --> 27:32.174
But would guilt consume
Harcourt Grimesby

27:32.250 --> 27:34.275
if he despised his father
as he claims?

27:34.352 --> 27:37.082
Is this another of your
confounding Jesuit arguments?

27:37.155 --> 27:38.986
I'll admit, it is possible.

27:39.057 --> 27:40.024
I'm simply saying

27:40.091 --> 27:42.116
that there are inconsistencies
in his confession

27:42.193 --> 27:43.125
which make no sense.

27:43.194 --> 27:44.957
Unless...

27:46.231 --> 27:48.290
Bloody hell, Murdoch, say it!
Unless what?

27:54.873 --> 27:57.341
Unless there was a third party
involved.

27:57.409 --> 27:58.341
A third party?

27:58.410 --> 28:00.708
All right,
I'll go along with that.

28:00.779 --> 28:02.906
We've eliminated the cuckolded
husband and his lovely wife,

28:02.981 --> 28:04.812
and Mrs. Grimesby is long dead.

28:04.883 --> 28:07.374
So, you tell me, Detective,
who does that leave?

28:15.694 --> 28:17.525
Stop it!
You'll kill him!

28:17.595 --> 28:20.325
That's the whole idea, stupid!

28:23.535 --> 28:25.503
I have no relevant theory
at the moment, sir.

28:25.570 --> 28:27.902
Well, until you do, the belly
speaker stays locked up.

28:27.972 --> 28:30.566
What I find puzzling
is Harcourt was in the room.

28:30.642 --> 28:32.405
He saw the killer.

28:32.477 --> 28:34.172
And if so, why does he insist

28:34.245 --> 28:35.303
on protecting
the killer's identity.

28:35.380 --> 28:36.438
William?

28:36.514 --> 28:39.449
Inspector.
May we have a word?

28:39.517 --> 28:40.575
Yes, of course.

28:40.652 --> 28:41.619
Mr. Doyle has convinced me

28:41.686 --> 28:43.381
that a great miscarriage
of justice has been carried out.

28:43.455 --> 28:44.786
What are you talking about?

28:44.856 --> 28:46.323
Thomas, it has to do
with Mr. Lee's death.

28:46.391 --> 28:47.619
It was not murder.

28:47.692 --> 28:49.250
This is very serious.
Are you sure, Mr. Doyle?

28:49.327 --> 28:51.056
The bruising
on the deceased body

28:51.129 --> 28:53.393
was a result
of an ancient Oriental treatment

28:53.465 --> 28:54.693
for congestion of the lungs.

28:54.766 --> 28:56.233
It's a technique called cupping.

28:56.301 --> 28:57.893
Cupping?
What the bloody hell is that?

28:57.969 --> 28:59.095
Yes,
I've heard of this technique.

28:59.170 --> 29:00.865
It involves a heated cup
placed on the skin

29:00.939 --> 29:01.928
to create a partial vacuum.

29:02.006 --> 29:03.405
Drawing up
the underlying tissues.

29:03.475 --> 29:04.635
And after a few moments,

29:04.709 --> 29:06.142
the blood is drawn
to the surface of the skin.

29:06.211 --> 29:08.111
Yes, much like...
What is the colloquialism?

29:08.179 --> 29:09.271
- Love bites.
- Correct.

29:09.347 --> 29:11.406
But more importantly,
the marks appear to be bruises

29:11.483 --> 29:13.417
causing the illusion
that the victim has been beaten.

29:13.485 --> 29:14.816
So, the victim
was cupped to death?

29:14.886 --> 29:15.875
No, no.

29:15.954 --> 29:17.854
The victim was suffering
from consumption.

29:17.922 --> 29:19.913
Mr. Sing is an Oriental
medical practitioner.

29:19.991 --> 29:21.891
That's what the herbs
in his flat were for.

29:21.960 --> 29:23.621
So, Mr. Sing was employing
this cupping technique

29:23.695 --> 29:24.889
to try and cure the victim.

29:24.963 --> 29:27.397
But, being elderly,
he suffered a heart attack.

29:27.465 --> 29:28.762
This all sounds like weird,

29:28.833 --> 29:29.765
African witch-doctor business
to me.

29:29.834 --> 29:31.734
Eastern medical practices
are very different from ours.

29:31.803 --> 29:33.896
Regardless, Mr. Sing is innocent
and must be released.

29:33.972 --> 29:36.099
Well, unfortunately,
you're a tad late, I'm afraid.

29:36.174 --> 29:37.106
What are you talking about?

29:37.175 --> 29:39.609
Well, I tried to get you in to
speak with the Oriental old dog,

29:39.677 --> 29:41.770
but, uh, he met his maker
three days ago.

29:41.846 --> 29:43.108
Damnation!

29:43.181 --> 29:45.411
Mr. Doyle?
What on earth?

29:45.483 --> 29:46.950
What's wrong with Arthur?

29:47.018 --> 29:48.815
I'll speak with him.

30:02.066 --> 30:05.126
Mr. Doyle, you have led me
on quite a chase.

30:05.203 --> 30:07.103
Ah, if it's not
the great detective,

30:07.172 --> 30:10.266
staring blankly into the face of
death without skipping a beat.

30:10.341 --> 30:11.330
Sir, I am not Sherlock Holmes.

30:11.409 --> 30:12.740
Now, please tell me.
What is going on?

30:12.811 --> 30:14.574
What are you talking about, sir?

30:14.646 --> 30:16.944
You are not here to write
some book about me, are you?

30:17.015 --> 30:18.312
Barkeep, another!

30:18.383 --> 30:19.748
Whatever it is
you are doing here

30:19.818 --> 30:21.376
has something to do
with this cupping incident.

30:21.452 --> 30:24.182
My reasons for being here
are my own, damn it!

30:24.255 --> 30:25.415
Damn it all to hell!

30:34.632 --> 30:37.999
Barkeep, I said another!

30:54.853 --> 30:58.516
Barkeep, I want another drink!

31:00.692 --> 31:01.681
Murdoch!

31:01.759 --> 31:03.556
You can't do this to me,
Murdoch!

31:03.628 --> 31:06.153
I demand to speak
to Inspector Brackenreid!

31:06.231 --> 31:10.190
You will speak to him,
Mr. Doyle, once you are sober.

31:11.369 --> 31:12.768
You can't do this to me!

31:12.837 --> 31:15.362
I demand to speak
to Inspector Crabandpeed.

31:16.975 --> 31:19.637
That all you got, Doyle?
Huh?

31:19.711 --> 31:23.613
Oh, something on your mind,
Doyle?

31:42.000 --> 31:43.831
Why are you mean to me?

31:43.902 --> 31:44.994
You know.

31:45.069 --> 31:47.833
I've done so much for you.
I made you part of the family.

31:47.906 --> 31:50.272
- Oh, now we're brothers, are we?
- I tried.

31:50.341 --> 31:51.308
Yeah, big deal.

31:51.376 --> 31:53.708
Ooh, the pugilist wakes.

31:53.778 --> 31:55.245
How's your head, Doyle?

31:55.313 --> 31:56.541
How's your nose, puppet?

31:56.614 --> 31:58.343
Clever.
You should be a writer.

31:58.416 --> 32:00.850
Sherlock, Shmerlock.

32:00.919 --> 32:01.851
You did what?

32:01.920 --> 32:02.909
Doyle was drunk and disorderly,
sir.

32:02.987 --> 32:04.921
Choffing hell, Murdoch.
He's not a thug.

32:04.989 --> 32:06.820
Drag him out the pub,
let him cool down, yes.

32:06.891 --> 32:08.188
But don't lock him up!

32:08.259 --> 32:09.453
The man is a literary lion,

32:09.527 --> 32:11.552
possibly the world's
greatest living author.

32:11.629 --> 32:13.927
And now he's locked up in a jail
cell like a common ruffian.

32:13.998 --> 32:15.465
Miller, release him!

32:15.533 --> 32:19.731
If the broadsheets get hold
of this, we'll be demonized.

32:19.804 --> 32:24.241
Arthur, please,
please forgive this injustice.

32:24.309 --> 32:26.504
- I am appalled beyond outrage.
- It's quite all right, Thomas.

32:26.577 --> 32:28.101
I beg your pardon,
but like bloody hell it is.

32:28.179 --> 32:31.239
Allow me to buy you breakfast
by way of atonement.

32:31.316 --> 32:32.681
A welcome gesture, Thomas.

32:32.750 --> 32:36.447
Murdoch, I believe
you have something to say.

32:36.521 --> 32:38.284
Yes, sir.

32:38.356 --> 32:40.187
Inspector, if I might have
a word alone with the detective,

32:40.258 --> 32:41.190
I'll be with you straightaway.

32:41.259 --> 32:42.920
If you insist.

32:44.796 --> 32:46.923
Set this straight.

32:48.333 --> 32:49.664
- Arthur.
- William.

32:49.734 --> 32:51.929
I apologize profusely.
I behaved a fool.

32:52.003 --> 32:54.938
Hey, I'm the one you punched.
Talk to me.

32:55.006 --> 32:56.473
Would someone please put
a termite

32:56.541 --> 32:58.099
up that puppet's applecart?

32:58.176 --> 32:59.609
Oh, now, that is just rude.

32:59.677 --> 33:01.042
I have an applecart?

33:01.112 --> 33:03.637
That's enough, Mr. Grimesby.

33:04.882 --> 33:06.577
Apologies notwithstanding,
Mr. Doyle,

33:06.651 --> 33:08.050
I daresay your behavior
last night

33:08.119 --> 33:10.019
was not entirely
the fault of drink.

33:10.088 --> 33:12.921
Yes, I suppose not.

33:12.991 --> 33:14.652
Touie's very ill.

33:14.726 --> 33:15.750
Touie?

33:15.827 --> 33:17.226
That's my wife, Louise.

33:17.295 --> 33:19.320
I call her Touie.
She has consumption.

33:19.397 --> 33:21.422
Ooh, so sad.

33:23.034 --> 33:24.365
So sad!

33:24.435 --> 33:26.596
Stop it!
You stop it this instant!

33:26.671 --> 33:28.161
William, what are you doing?

33:29.073 --> 33:30.734
- Uh-oh.
- George, get in here!

33:30.808 --> 33:31.934
William!

33:32.010 --> 33:33.477
Get him away!

33:33.544 --> 33:35.978
No!
Leave him alone!

33:36.781 --> 33:39.079
Give him back!

33:39.150 --> 33:41.311
- Please.
- Come on.

33:41.386 --> 33:44.549
Please, please, please,
please give him back!

33:44.622 --> 33:47.182
Give him back, please!

33:49.560 --> 33:52.688
You and I, William,
have much in common.

33:53.464 --> 33:56.456
My father, like yours,
was a terrible alcoholic.

33:56.534 --> 33:58.468
I felt my only hope
was to have him committed.

33:58.536 --> 34:01.528
He died recently.

34:01.606 --> 34:02.868
I'm sorry.

34:02.940 --> 34:04.635
And now Touie's illness.

34:04.709 --> 34:06.006
Same that took your Liza.

34:08.012 --> 34:11.504
Is that the reason for
the interest in the Lee case?

34:11.581 --> 34:13.311
Consumption.

34:13.384 --> 34:16.148
I've traveled extensively,
seeking some cure.

34:16.219 --> 34:19.313
After I left Toronto,
I traveled the Midwest.

34:19.389 --> 34:20.982
Chicago.

34:21.059 --> 34:22.788
And there I met a man
who told me about cupping.

34:22.860 --> 34:23.827
So I've heard.

34:23.895 --> 34:26.226
Then I remembered reading
about Mr. Lee's murder

34:26.297 --> 34:27.559
and the strange bruising.

34:27.632 --> 34:29.759
I realized there must be
a practitioner here.

34:29.833 --> 34:31.391
That's why you returned.

34:31.469 --> 34:33.402
Yes, to confirm my suspicions.

34:33.471 --> 34:36.065
And to free the practitioner.

34:36.139 --> 34:38.438
Mr. Doyle,
why not simply tell me?

34:38.509 --> 34:41.478
Pride, I suppose.

34:41.545 --> 34:45.572
Fear of failure,
as is now the case.

34:46.284 --> 34:48.684
I'm becoming
increasingly agitated,

34:48.753 --> 34:51.483
as last night
painfully demonstrates.

34:51.556 --> 34:53.319
Mr. Doyle,
I am truly sorry for you,

34:53.391 --> 34:55.859
but I still don't believe
you're telling me the truth.

34:55.927 --> 34:57.554
I assure you.

34:57.628 --> 35:00.961
There is a very large
Oriental population in London.

35:01.032 --> 35:02.829
Surely, you could have sought
treatment for her there.

35:02.900 --> 35:05.494
Then what possible reason
could I have for being here?

35:05.570 --> 35:06.798
I believe you're running, sir.

35:06.871 --> 35:09.066
Running?

35:11.342 --> 35:13.469
I know how painful it can be,

35:13.544 --> 35:17.139
watching the woman you love
slowly die.

35:17.215 --> 35:19.649
Powerless to do anything
to help.

35:21.919 --> 35:24.285
How does one rise above it,
William?

35:26.390 --> 35:28.688
You don't.

35:28.759 --> 35:31.660
You descend into it.

35:31.729 --> 35:35.392
And you cherish every moment
you have left with each other.

35:35.466 --> 35:38.958
Mr. Doyle, go home.

35:39.036 --> 35:40.503
Be with her.

35:43.441 --> 35:44.373
Sir, pardon me.

35:44.442 --> 35:45.670
I thought you might want to know

35:45.743 --> 35:47.335
the suspect has become
quite agitated

35:47.411 --> 35:49.504
since we took his puppet.

35:49.580 --> 35:51.980
That might not be a bad thing,
George.

35:52.049 --> 35:53.573
Just keep an eye on him.

35:53.651 --> 35:56.176
- Please.
- Sir.

35:57.855 --> 36:00.722
If I may return the favor,
William, of helpful words.

36:00.791 --> 36:02.725
- An observation?
- Of course.

36:02.793 --> 36:05.284
Your prisoner and his puppet
had a roiling bond between them.

36:05.363 --> 36:07.593
I've seen it.
Its meaning escapes me.

36:07.665 --> 36:10.225
It's like a war of the wills
or conscience.

36:10.301 --> 36:12.132
Like I had on occasion
with my brother.

36:12.203 --> 36:16.196
In fact, the puppet calls
Harcourt his brother.

36:16.274 --> 36:19.175
Dismissively, but I think
it may be significant.

36:19.243 --> 36:21.643
Ooh, ask me.
I know!

36:21.712 --> 36:23.270
Hoo-hoo!

36:25.650 --> 36:27.049
Thank you, Arthur.

37:07.358 --> 37:09.292
Here are
all the "G" birth records

37:09.360 --> 37:11.760
between 1865 and 1870.

37:11.829 --> 37:13.626
Excellent.
Thank you.

37:14.765 --> 37:19.168
So, I understand that you and
Mr. Doyle had a disagreement.

37:19.237 --> 37:21.137
Yes.
We've sorted matters out.

37:21.205 --> 37:23.696
And?

37:23.774 --> 37:26.971
He revealed personal reasons
which explain his being here

37:27.044 --> 37:28.875
that I'm not at liberty
to discuss.

37:28.946 --> 37:32.473
So he won't be writing stories
based on you, then?

37:32.550 --> 37:36.782
Uh, well, he didn't say exactly,
but I'd rather expect not.

37:36.854 --> 37:38.651
Ah, here we are.

37:38.723 --> 37:41.487
Baby Grimesby.

37:41.559 --> 37:43.424
- Aha.
- What is it?

37:43.494 --> 37:45.689
There are two Grimesby
birth certificates.

37:45.763 --> 37:46.889
Two?

37:46.964 --> 37:50.229
Mr. Doyle suggested that
Harcourt and his puppet Mycroft

37:50.301 --> 37:51.768
were at a war of conscience.

37:51.836 --> 37:52.768
Like brothers.

37:52.837 --> 37:55.965
There was a twin, named Mycroft.

37:56.040 --> 37:56.972
Oh.

37:57.041 --> 38:00.204
I've been speaking
to the wrong witness.

38:00.278 --> 38:03.008
I must speak to the conscience
of the killer.

38:03.080 --> 38:05.014
He saw it all.

38:07.952 --> 38:08.884
Mycroft.

38:08.953 --> 38:10.887
Thank you, Detective.

38:10.955 --> 38:12.786
I will only speak to Mycroft.

38:12.857 --> 38:14.518
You can't be serious.

38:14.592 --> 38:16.822
Only to him or I take him away.

38:19.964 --> 38:21.431
All right, give him to me.

38:26.671 --> 38:28.070
Mycroft...

38:29.807 --> 38:30.899
why are there two?

38:30.975 --> 38:33.034
Two what?
Two what? Show me.

38:33.110 --> 38:34.737
I'm not speaking to you,
Harcourt.

38:37.581 --> 38:42.678
Mycroft, in our first interview,
you said, "Ask me. "

38:42.753 --> 38:44.744
You said you knew what happened.

38:44.822 --> 38:47.586
There are two
birth certificates.

38:47.658 --> 38:49.626
So, now tell my why.

38:49.694 --> 38:51.559
No, don't answer.

38:51.629 --> 38:53.256
- It's a trick.
- Let Mycroft answer.

38:53.331 --> 38:54.423
No, Mycroft, don't.

38:54.498 --> 38:57.126
Mycroft, you've been wanting
to tell me the whole time.

38:57.201 --> 38:59.101
You speak
for Harcourt's twin brother.

38:59.170 --> 39:01.297
- I don't have a twin.
- Be quiet.

39:01.372 --> 39:04.068
Look at it.
Look!

39:04.842 --> 39:06.673
The birth record.
Three minutes after yours.

39:06.744 --> 39:08.075
It's not true.
It's a mistake.

39:08.145 --> 39:09.305
He was there, wasn't he?

39:09.380 --> 39:11.143
You watched your twin brother
murder your father.

39:11.215 --> 39:12.147
I did not.

39:12.216 --> 39:14.275
Who else would you be willing
to go to the grave for?

39:14.352 --> 39:15.319
- Huh?
- Stop.

39:15.386 --> 39:16.478
- Harcourt?
- Stop.

39:16.554 --> 39:17.486
The truth is out.

39:17.555 --> 39:19.216
You can't protect your brother
any longer.

39:19.290 --> 39:20.279
It's over.

39:26.464 --> 39:28.762
Where did you get that?
You have no right to have that!

39:28.833 --> 39:30.425
Why isn't he in the photograph?

39:30.501 --> 39:32.435
What happened to him?

39:32.503 --> 39:36.599
He's still there.
He's still there.

39:36.674 --> 39:39.438
Did your brother
kill your father?

39:40.945 --> 39:42.503
Did he?

39:45.282 --> 39:46.715
Yes.

39:46.784 --> 39:49.582
It was Mycroft.

39:57.495 --> 39:58.427
Why?

39:58.496 --> 40:01.988
Mother and Father
couldn't afford to keep us both,

40:02.066 --> 40:04.296
so Mycroft was given away
at birth.

40:04.368 --> 40:06.495
Damn them, they didn't even
tell me he existed.

40:06.570 --> 40:08.401
I had to find out
from Mycroft himself.

40:08.472 --> 40:10.565
Mycroft found you?

40:10.641 --> 40:12.268
By accident.

40:12.343 --> 40:14.402
He saw a show poster
with me on it

40:14.478 --> 40:16.844
and realized he had
an identical twin.

40:18.015 --> 40:21.212
He wanted to be
a part of the family,

40:21.285 --> 40:24.516
so I told him
where our father lived.

40:24.588 --> 40:26.146
God forgive me.

40:26.223 --> 40:27.884
You didn't know
he was bent on revenge

40:27.958 --> 40:30.358
or that he would frame you
for the crime.

40:30.428 --> 40:34.023
Harcourt,
the day of the murder...

40:34.098 --> 40:36.862
I went to look in on Father.

40:41.038 --> 40:43.632
You did this to me.

40:43.707 --> 40:46.335
This is your doing, Brother.

40:55.786 --> 40:58.118
Where is he now,
the real Mycroft?

40:58.189 --> 41:00.316
I don't know.
He lives on the streets.

41:00.391 --> 41:02.222
So, why just accept the blame?

41:07.164 --> 41:10.429
I'm the reason
that my brother lives in hell.

41:10.501 --> 41:13.231
I couldn't also send him
to the gallows.

41:14.605 --> 41:17.005
Don't you understand, Detective?

41:19.009 --> 41:22.536
Why was I the one they kept?

41:22.613 --> 41:24.444
Why me?

41:33.657 --> 41:35.454
Just dropping in to say
my goodbyes, William,

41:35.526 --> 41:37.460
and to congratulate you
on a job well done.

41:37.528 --> 41:38.620
Thank you, Arthur.

41:38.696 --> 41:40.425
If you ever tire
of this detecting business,

41:40.498 --> 41:43.228
may I say a career
as an alienist awaits?

41:43.300 --> 41:44.733
What?
Still at it?

41:44.802 --> 41:47.134
The Grimesby murder
even though Harcourt's released?

41:47.204 --> 41:48.728
Well, we've yet to find Mycroft.

41:48.806 --> 41:51.036
I'm confident
you will apprehend him.

41:51.108 --> 41:53.338
You know, it's not the case
that bothers me.

41:53.410 --> 41:54.672
It's the family decimated.

41:54.745 --> 41:57.111
Yes, family, as we can attest.

41:57.181 --> 41:58.671
Well, I thought
you'd like to know,

41:58.749 --> 42:00.649
I've opted for the story
of the hounds,

42:00.718 --> 42:02.709
with my old friend Sherlock.

42:02.786 --> 42:04.845
Oh, the inspector
will be thrilled.

42:04.922 --> 42:06.719
Perhaps.

42:10.160 --> 42:12.594
Yes, there will be certain
modifications to his story,

42:12.663 --> 42:13.755
however.

42:15.065 --> 42:16.293
And your next adventure?

42:16.367 --> 42:18.358
Home.
With Louise, where I belong.

42:18.435 --> 42:21.768
Would you relay my apologies
to Dr. Ogden?

42:21.839 --> 42:24.103
You could do worse than spend
more time with that one,

42:24.174 --> 42:25.607
- I estimate.
- Oh?

42:26.176 --> 42:29.168
Well, thank you, William,
until next time.

42:29.246 --> 42:30.235
Good luck, Arthur.

42:30.314 --> 42:31.542
And sad fortunes reversed.

42:31.615 --> 42:34.083
Yes.
Reversed.

42:36.820 --> 42:39.288
Sorry?

42:45.062 --> 42:46.757
I can't believe it.

42:46.830 --> 42:49.424
It's been right in front
of my eyes the whole time.

42:49.500 --> 42:51.365
- What has?
- Look here.

42:51.435 --> 42:53.926
The boy's eyes.
One dark, one light.

42:54.004 --> 42:55.562
Yes, the heterochromia.
What of it?

42:55.639 --> 42:57.072
The eye colors,
they're reversed!

42:57.141 --> 42:59.234
- From what?
- From our suspect's eyes.

42:59.310 --> 43:01.437
We never had Harcourt Grimesby
in custody.

43:01.512 --> 43:03.207
It was Mycroft all along?

43:03.280 --> 43:05.407
Well, good God, sir.

43:05.482 --> 43:07.450
Where the devil
is the real Harcourt Grimesby?

43:07.518 --> 43:09.986
He's still here.

43:10.054 --> 43:12.386
He's still here.

43:12.456 --> 43:14.549
Inspector!

43:41.986 --> 43:44.079
So, this is Harcourt?

43:44.154 --> 43:46.088
He looks to be
about 10 years of age.

43:46.156 --> 43:48.454
And his body has lay hidden here
all these years.

43:48.525 --> 43:49.958
So, Mycroft lived life
as Harcourt.

43:50.027 --> 43:52.018
Apparently seeking out revenge
on his father

43:52.096 --> 43:53.222
for a lifetime of wrongs

43:53.297 --> 43:54.855
and perhaps also
for his brother.

43:54.932 --> 43:56.991
Mycroft told a story
just contradictory enough

43:57.067 --> 43:59.058
that you end up exonerating him

43:59.136 --> 44:00.660
and believing the real killer
is on the run.

44:00.738 --> 44:03.764
We'd have searched a lifetime
in vain.

44:03.841 --> 44:04.933
Crabtree, come on.

44:05.009 --> 44:06.670
I want every available man
looking for this nutcase.

44:06.744 --> 44:07.904
Sir.

44:13.484 --> 44:17.648
Harcourt Grimesby,
my sincerest apologies.
