03:32.713 --> 03:36.466
- Have you eaten anything?
- No.

03:36.717 --> 03:40.888
Hey, look, what is this, a picnic?
Come on. Let's go, man.
We got ten minutes to go.

03:48.562 --> 03:51.732
- Punch me out, man.
- You got it.

04:31.104 --> 04:35.526
Any word from the LAPD intelligence,
if there is such a thing?

04:35.692 --> 04:38.111
- Not yet, sir.
- Of course not.

04:38.237 --> 04:42.115
Because we're a covert
anti-terrorism team that is so secret...

04:42.199 --> 04:44.201
that when we snap our fingers
nothin' happens!

04:55.838 --> 04:58.048
Sheriff's department?
Airport police?

04:58.215 --> 05:00.968
Still waiting. But Interpol
insists he's in Tripoli.

05:01.176 --> 05:04.638
Yeah, well, you-you trust... You trust
that billion-dollar satellite, okay?

05:04.721 --> 05:07.808
I'll trust a ten-dollar snitch
at this point.

05:09.226 --> 05:12.187
- Sean, look...
- What?

05:12.312 --> 05:15.065
Why don't you just give 'em
a little break, okay?

05:15.232 --> 05:18.902
We'll take a break
when the case breaks, okay?

05:24.908 --> 05:26.827
Hallelujah

05:26.910 --> 05:30.998
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah

05:31.165 --> 05:33.041
Hallelujah

05:33.167 --> 05:35.752
Hallelujah, hallelujah

05:35.919 --> 05:41.008
For the Lord God
Omnipotent reigneth

05:41.175 --> 05:42.926
Hallelu... Hallelu...
Hallelujah

05:43.093 --> 05:47.097
For the Lord God
Omnipotent reigneth

05:47.264 --> 05:50.934
Hallelu... Hallelu...
Hallelu... Hallelu... Hallelujah

05:51.101 --> 05:57.024
For the Lord God
Omnipotent reigneth

05:57.191 --> 06:00.861
Hallelujah

06:00.944 --> 06:05.365
- And he shall reign for ever and ever
- I never really enjoyed The Messiah.

06:05.532 --> 06:08.619
- In fact, I think it's fucking boring.
- And he shall reign for ever and ever

06:08.785 --> 06:13.790
But your voice makes even a hack
like Handel seem like a genius.

06:14.958 --> 06:18.629
Hallelujah, hallelujah

06:18.795 --> 06:20.881
Hallelujah, hallelujah

06:20.964 --> 06:23.133
Hallelujah

06:23.300 --> 06:25.469
Hallelujah, hallelujah

06:25.636 --> 06:32.976
Hallelujah

06:33.810 --> 06:36.063
Victor... When we...
When we put this thing to bed,

06:36.230 --> 06:38.649
y-you can brand
the Fourth Amendment on my butt.

06:38.815 --> 06:42.319
- Thank you.
- Sir, excuse me.
Your wife is on line one.

06:42.486 --> 06:46.073
Sean! A jet was just chartered.
Anderson Airfield.

06:46.240 --> 06:48.825
Guess who paid the bill in cash?
Pollux Troy.

06:48.992 --> 06:51.828
- Put one of our people on that plane.
- Wait! We still got no sign of Castor!

06:51.995 --> 06:55.916
Pollux doesn't fly without
Big Brother. Now come on!

07:36.123 --> 07:40.544
You're 26 minutes late.
The casing didn't fit, right?

07:40.711 --> 07:43.547
Yeah, I told you goddam Dietrich
would try to pawn off some...

07:43.714 --> 07:45.716
cheap-shit North Korean plastic.

07:45.883 --> 07:48.886
Casing fit like a condom.

07:49.052 --> 07:52.389
You didn't deviate
from the plan, did you, Pollux?

07:52.556 --> 07:55.225
Well, how long did you want me
to sit here twiddling my thumbs?

07:55.392 --> 07:59.062
I paid for the jet.
Save us some time.

07:59.229 --> 08:03.650
That's what the boys are for,
to hide our famous faces.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.662
If I didn't love you so damn
much, I'd have to kill you, bro.

08:15.829 --> 08:18.499
I hate it when you
call me bro.

08:27.508 --> 08:29.510
You guys are paid
to protect him from everybody,

08:29.676 --> 08:31.929
including himself.

08:32.095 --> 08:36.600
And stay away from downtown on the 18th.
It's gonna be a little, um, smoggy.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.855
Okay, my passengers are here.
I gotta go.

08:47.277 --> 08:49.947
Let's go. Let's go.
I'm bored. Let's go.

08:50.113 --> 08:52.783
- Here you go.
- Bravo.

08:52.950 --> 08:55.702
Would you like anything else
once we're airborne?

08:55.869 --> 08:57.955
Oh, a peach.

08:59.873 --> 09:02.793
Sit. Come here.

09:07.297 --> 09:10.884
You know, I can, uh,
eat a peach for hours.

09:13.804 --> 09:16.223
Um, come here.

09:16.390 --> 09:20.978
If I were to send you flowers,
where would I, uh...

09:21.144 --> 09:23.564
No, wait. Let me rephrase.

09:23.730 --> 09:28.068
If I were to let you
suck my tongue,

09:29.403 --> 09:32.239
would you be grateful?

09:53.760 --> 09:55.929
There's someone on the runway.

09:59.349 --> 10:02.102
Get off of me!

10:15.532 --> 10:18.535
- Archer.
- FBI!

10:24.833 --> 10:28.212
This is a very big gun.
Fly the fuckin' plane!

10:32.341 --> 10:34.551
Come on. That's it.

10:38.555 --> 10:42.184
- Come on. Let's go!
- Goddam it. Don't play chicken
with a goddam jet!

10:46.146 --> 10:48.148
Come on.

10:54.238 --> 10:58.200
- He's got Winters! Goddam it!
- Damn it, Sean!

11:08.669 --> 11:11.338
All units, pin 'em in!

11:13.090 --> 11:15.342
Close in on 'em!

11:21.598 --> 11:24.101
One of yours, Sean?

11:26.103 --> 11:27.855
Shit!

11:41.618 --> 11:44.705
Out. Come on. Go, go!

11:47.040 --> 11:48.959
Goddam it, Sean!

12:01.138 --> 12:03.974
Take off now.

12:09.229 --> 12:12.149
- Fly!
- I can't!

12:12.316 --> 12:14.818
Fly, bitch!

12:26.997 --> 12:29.833
All units, locked and ready.
Follow Archer's lead.

12:39.760 --> 12:41.762
What the fuck are you doing?

12:41.845 --> 12:45.015
There's an engine out.
We gotta stop.

13:31.478 --> 13:33.480
- Move, move, move!
- Get back! Back up!

14:05.929 --> 14:08.432
Pollux!

14:11.768 --> 14:13.687
- Cas!
- Get over here.

14:15.606 --> 14:17.608
Back him to me.
Back him to me. He's mine!

14:29.786 --> 14:32.039
Cas.

14:36.043 --> 14:37.961
Secure the hangar.

15:03.987 --> 15:06.073
Berkley, down!

15:20.254 --> 15:23.006
Down!

16:06.717 --> 16:09.052
Give up, Castor. Your time's up.

16:11.388 --> 16:14.725
Well, you better hit me, Sean,
'cause you only got one bullet left.

16:14.892 --> 16:17.561
So do you.

16:17.644 --> 16:22.316
Wow. We've got
something in common.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.735
We both know our guns.

16:24.902 --> 16:29.656
What we don't have in common is that
I don't care if I live, and you do.

16:29.823 --> 16:33.660
Sean, that hurts.

16:33.827 --> 16:36.330
You're not having
any fun, are you, Sean?

16:36.497 --> 16:39.166
Why don't you come with us?
Try terrorism for hire?

16:39.333 --> 16:41.835
- We'll blow some shit up.
It's more fun.
- Shut the fuck up.

16:42.002 --> 16:44.588
You watch your fuckin' mouth!

16:44.755 --> 16:48.926
I'm about to unleash
the biblical plague "Hell-A" deserves,

16:49.092 --> 16:51.595
but I'll give this shithole
a break if my brother and I walk.

16:51.762 --> 16:56.016
- Bullshit.
- Oh-Oh no, I-I see, I see.
Y-You think I'm bluffing.

16:56.099 --> 16:59.520
Maybe I am.
But, then, maybe I'm not.

16:59.686 --> 17:01.939
More importantly, what would
you do with me locked up?

17:02.105 --> 17:04.358
You'd drive your wife
and kid crazy.

17:04.441 --> 17:06.527
Say, how is your daughter,
anyway? Is she ripening by now?

17:06.693 --> 17:09.195
Your... Your darling Janie,
your little peach?

17:09.363 --> 17:12.031
Is she ripe?

17:14.785 --> 17:16.619
Okay.

17:16.787 --> 17:19.039
O-Okay.

17:19.205 --> 17:21.375
Policeman, don't shoot me.

17:23.544 --> 17:26.296
I'm scared, Seanie!

17:29.299 --> 17:31.468
Well, I think you better pull
the trigger,

17:31.635 --> 17:33.554
because I don't give a fuck!

17:33.637 --> 17:35.973
I'm ready

17:36.139 --> 17:39.893
Ready for the big ride, baby

18:08.338 --> 18:12.259
Well, Sean, looks like
Elvis done left the buildin'.

18:24.688 --> 18:28.692
It wasn't my fault.
Why won't you ever be on my side?

18:28.859 --> 18:32.029
I am always on your side,
but you have to give me a chance...

18:32.237 --> 18:34.448
Now what?

18:34.615 --> 18:37.618
She was suspended again. Some kid
made a crack about her clothes...

18:37.743 --> 18:40.704
- She started a fight.
- That's right, Dad.
Don't even ask me what happened.

18:40.871 --> 18:43.540
Okay. What happened?

18:49.213 --> 18:53.467
- Ah, I see.
- Not like you would believe me anyway.

18:53.550 --> 18:56.136
Jamie, look,
it-it-it's not easy, okay?

18:56.303 --> 19:00.474
I mean, loo... You change the way
you look every week.

19:00.557 --> 19:05.103
And-And the way you act.
Who are you supposed to be now?

19:05.229 --> 19:07.481
I'm supposed to be me.

19:07.689 --> 19:11.109
Not like you have a clue
who I am anyway.

19:18.909 --> 19:21.411
I have to work tonight.

19:21.578 --> 19:25.415
I called to tell you,
but I was on hold for ten minutes,
and I couldn't wait any longer.

19:25.582 --> 19:28.669
I got him, Eve.

19:31.421 --> 19:33.966
It's over.

19:34.091 --> 19:36.051
It's over.

19:38.637 --> 19:40.556
Oh, Sean.

19:43.851 --> 19:47.229
I'll make it up to you
and Jamie. I promise.

19:47.437 --> 19:51.608
I'll put in for a desk job...
Well, I'll... I'll do counselling,
sit down, talk about Mike...

19:51.775 --> 19:53.861
I'll do it, anything you want.

19:55.279 --> 19:57.656
I just want you.

19:57.781 --> 20:00.534
Well, good, 'cause that's
what you're gonna get.

20:00.701 --> 20:02.536
You happy?

20:02.703 --> 20:04.872
Yes. Yeah.

20:34.067 --> 20:36.236
What is all this?

20:37.654 --> 20:41.325
Sir, the CIA sent this over.

20:41.450 --> 20:44.578
I didn't know they catered.
Send it back.

20:44.661 --> 20:46.914
No, wait.

20:48.665 --> 20:51.335
How about, uh...

20:51.376 --> 20:54.171
What about to Anderson,
Montgomery,

20:54.338 --> 20:56.423
Berkley,

20:58.592 --> 21:02.763
Pincus, Gianelli, Winters...

21:41.885 --> 21:43.846
How's Loomis?

21:43.971 --> 21:47.641
Uh, he's gonna need
a little surgery, but, uh,

21:47.808 --> 21:50.644
he'll be okay.

21:50.727 --> 21:53.772
- What's up?
- Special ops. They want a word.

21:53.897 --> 21:55.983
Aw, forget it.
I don't have the time.

21:56.149 --> 21:59.069
Better make time, Sean.

21:59.236 --> 22:01.488
Recovered from the jet wreckage.

22:01.572 --> 22:03.657
Found in Pollux Troy's
briefcase.

22:22.009 --> 22:24.178
Porcelain casing.

22:24.344 --> 22:26.180
Thermal cloak.

22:26.346 --> 22:29.349
Nerve gas
and biological payload.

22:29.474 --> 22:31.602
It's enough to flatten
a square mile.

22:31.810 --> 22:34.354
Then depending on
the prevailing winds,

22:34.438 --> 22:39.443
the fallout'll be a tad worse
than Gulf War syndrome.

22:41.195 --> 22:44.072
A biblical...
A biblical plague to LA.

22:45.699 --> 22:48.368
Where is he?
Where is Pollux Troy?

22:52.581 --> 22:55.959
Why draw the schematic if you're
not gonna build the bomb?

22:56.126 --> 22:58.962
What, is it now a crime
in this country to exercise the mind?

22:59.129 --> 23:03.217
- I'm interested in bomb...
- I won't say another word
until I see my brother.

23:05.052 --> 23:07.471
Any progress?

23:07.638 --> 23:10.307
- I need about ten minutes alone
with this guy.
- Ah, give it a rest.

23:10.474 --> 23:12.726
You got Castor. Just go home.

23:12.893 --> 23:15.145
Look, we're not gonna evacuate
the city on your hunch.

23:15.312 --> 23:18.315
Look, I know Castor too well
for this to be a hunch.

23:18.482 --> 23:23.403
You know what, just-just run
the goddam bureau any way you like.

23:32.162 --> 23:36.250
I could put an agent in his cell.
Maybe Pollux will let it slip.

23:36.416 --> 23:40.087
Oh, come on.
He's a paranoid sociopath.

23:40.254 --> 23:43.674
The only person he'd talk to about
that bomb is his brother, and he's dead.

23:45.175 --> 23:47.761
There is one other possibility.

24:13.287 --> 24:16.707
Oh, God.
You're keeping him alive.

24:16.874 --> 24:20.043
Relax, Archer. He's a turnip.

24:22.713 --> 24:24.715
Oh.

24:24.882 --> 24:28.135
What if you could walk
into Erewhon Prison...

24:28.302 --> 24:32.556
and give Pollux a nice, big
brotherly hug as Castor Troy?

24:34.224 --> 24:36.476
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

24:36.643 --> 24:39.980
Let me try. Malcolm Walsh.

24:40.063 --> 24:42.649
- I run the bio-cover unit
for special ops.
- I know who you are.

24:42.816 --> 24:45.235
- But you don't know what I can do.
- Uh...

24:45.402 --> 24:48.322
Physical alteration.
Augmentation.

24:48.405 --> 24:52.576
Dr Walsh can alter the likeness,
even the voice of a government witness.

24:52.743 --> 24:55.662
I think you'll recognize
this patient.

24:59.166 --> 25:02.669
We had to build your friend Loomis
a whole new ear from scratch.

25:11.762 --> 25:15.516
What we're suggesting for you, Archer,
isn't a permanent transplant like that,

25:15.682 --> 25:18.602
just a temporary trade.

25:18.769 --> 25:20.604
Come here.

25:23.273 --> 25:27.277
With the new anti-inflammatories,
healing takes days, not weeks.

25:27.444 --> 25:29.613
Your blood types won't match,
but Pollux won't know that.

25:29.780 --> 25:32.616
Height difference is negligible.

25:34.368 --> 25:39.206
Skin pigment, eye pigment:
Both almost identical.

25:39.289 --> 25:44.628
We'll use laser shears for the hairline,
microplugs for body hair.

25:44.795 --> 25:49.633
We'll do an abdominoplasti...
take care of those, uh, love handles.

25:49.800 --> 25:53.637
But all that's the easy part.
Here's the real science.

25:53.804 --> 25:57.224
This is a state-of-the-art,
morphogenetic template.

25:57.307 --> 26:00.477
The inside is modeled
on your skull,

26:00.644 --> 26:03.063
the outside exactly like Troy's.

26:03.146 --> 26:07.067
Then we fit his face on top.
Not a replica, but the real thing.

26:07.150 --> 26:09.903
Then we simply connect the muscles,
tear ducts and nerve endings.

26:10.070 --> 26:13.073
- So, you wanna take his face and mine...
- Borrow.

26:13.157 --> 26:15.659
The procedure's
completely reversible.

26:15.826 --> 26:18.579
Y-You think that I want
to do this?

26:18.745 --> 26:20.914
- No. No.
- There's no one else, Sean.

26:20.998 --> 26:24.418
- No!
- You have lived and breathed
Castor Troy for years.

26:24.585 --> 26:26.587
I'll get his gang to talk.
That's what I do.

26:26.753 --> 26:31.758
What if you can't? The bomb will blow,
and Castor Troy will win.

26:35.012 --> 26:38.265
Get out. Go ahead.
Wipe your ass.

26:38.432 --> 26:40.350
Damn, what the hell is
that smell?

26:40.517 --> 26:44.271
He shit in his pants.
Where's Dietrich?

26:44.354 --> 26:49.276
Hello, Sasha. When was the last
time you saw Castor Troy?

26:49.359 --> 26:51.612
- Who cares? He's dead.
- Answer the question.

26:51.778 --> 26:54.281
I know my rights. I don't have
to answer shit.

26:54.448 --> 26:56.366
You're right, but know this:

26:56.533 --> 26:59.953
You're a convicted felon on probation
for harbouring Castor Troy.

27:00.120 --> 27:03.624
One phone call from me, and your son
will end up in a foster home.

27:08.212 --> 27:12.049
I understand why
you would use such a threat.

27:12.216 --> 27:14.885
But you try to take him away
from me, I swear to you...

27:20.140 --> 27:23.393
I haven't seen him for years.

27:37.741 --> 27:40.911
This reeks of you. It's got
your signature all over it.

27:43.413 --> 27:47.835
Maybe, but you ain't got nothin'
on me and you know it.

27:48.001 --> 27:52.005
Maybe so, but I can keep you
within city limits,

27:52.172 --> 27:54.174
or I can talk
to your sister again.

27:54.341 --> 27:57.094
She's right outside.

27:57.261 --> 27:59.847
Only this time I'll be nice.

28:01.265 --> 28:03.600
Hey, Sean,

28:03.767 --> 28:06.019
how's your dead son?

28:14.194 --> 28:19.366
I don't know any...
Okay, okay, I heard somethin'
about the 18th, but that's all I know.

28:28.458 --> 28:32.129
Great. So we got a date.
Now where the hell's the damn bomb?

28:32.296 --> 28:34.548
Only Pollux Troy'll know that.

28:34.631 --> 28:37.134
It's your call, Sean.

28:37.301 --> 28:41.388
- Does Lazarro know your plan?
- No, this is a black bag operation.

28:41.555 --> 28:46.310
Strictly off the books. You can't tell
Lazarro, and you can't tell your wife.

28:48.979 --> 28:50.981
Oh, God.

28:51.148 --> 28:54.735
What are you asking me to do?
Okay, let's see.

28:54.902 --> 28:58.489
You're asking me to...
to break the law,

28:58.655 --> 29:01.408
risk my neck.

29:01.492 --> 29:04.578
And you're asking me to put
in the dark all the people...

29:04.745 --> 29:06.830
that love me...

29:06.997 --> 29:08.832
and trust me.

29:18.342 --> 29:20.260
I'll do it.

30:00.884 --> 30:02.970
Sean.

30:04.137 --> 30:05.973
Sorry I woke you.

30:06.139 --> 30:09.643
I'm glad it's you that woke me.

30:09.726 --> 30:12.563
And not a phone call telling me
you won't be coming home.

30:14.147 --> 30:16.984
But that's a fear I can
finally let go of, huh?

30:27.911 --> 30:31.498
Oh, it's all right, Sean.
It's okay.

30:33.584 --> 30:36.003
I keep...

30:36.086 --> 30:39.173
I keep wanting to move this...

30:39.339 --> 30:41.675
over here, you know?

30:41.758 --> 30:45.429
If it had only been an...
an inch to the left,

30:46.597 --> 30:49.016
Mikey'd be alive.

30:49.099 --> 30:53.604
And you wouldn't be.

30:53.770 --> 30:56.857
Sean, things are gonna get
better now that you're home.

30:57.024 --> 31:01.195
The scar won't move,
but it will heal if you let it.

31:01.278 --> 31:05.699
Everything will be better
now that he is forever out of our lives.

31:16.126 --> 31:19.713
Eve, if I told you
that I realize that...

31:19.796 --> 31:22.132
that this thing
won't fully end...

31:24.718 --> 31:27.471
u-until I did one last thing...

31:28.889 --> 31:31.558
Eve, something vital.

31:34.478 --> 31:38.065
Okay... I... You're going
back on assignment again.

31:39.316 --> 31:41.568
This one last time.

31:42.819 --> 31:45.239
Come on, Eve.

31:49.409 --> 31:52.913
"I'm going anywhere,"
that's what you told me.

31:53.080 --> 31:54.915
Oh.

32:00.671 --> 32:04.258
You don't need me to tell you
what to do, Sean. You never have. So go.

32:05.759 --> 32:07.594
But go now.

32:33.954 --> 32:38.375
Sean, I changed my mind.
This is a suicide mission.

32:38.542 --> 32:40.711
Yeah, I know, I know.

32:43.130 --> 32:47.134
You know, maybe this, uh...
this doctor... if he... if he...

32:47.301 --> 32:50.721
If he can do even half
of what he says he can do,

32:50.888 --> 32:53.807
maybe it'll work, I don't know.

32:53.974 --> 32:56.476
I'd become Castor Troy,
be in control.

32:56.643 --> 32:58.979
That's the part that scares me.

33:04.818 --> 33:07.488
Doctor, I have, uh, something...

33:08.655 --> 33:10.741
I have this scar... that... that...

33:10.908 --> 33:15.829
that if you can p-put this back
after, after all this is over...

33:15.913 --> 33:18.165
It... It's important to me.
It's... It's like a reminder.

33:18.332 --> 33:20.751
Sure.

33:25.005 --> 33:29.009
Tito, please,
hold this for me. Please.

33:32.179 --> 33:34.932
Okay. Let's go.

34:45.335 --> 34:47.670
Oh, G...

35:50.400 --> 35:52.319
Oh, my God.

37:03.724 --> 37:06.643
Hey, you okay? Come on.
Talk to me, Sean.

37:16.320 --> 37:19.656
Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

37:19.865 --> 37:21.950
- Sean! Sean!
- Fuck you!

37:22.075 --> 37:25.829
Sean, come on. Sit down.
Sit down. Sit down.

37:25.954 --> 37:28.499
Sean! Sean! Archer!

37:28.665 --> 37:31.168
You're Sean Archer.

37:31.335 --> 37:35.255
Sean Archer. Sean Archer.

37:40.052 --> 37:44.932
When this is over,
I want you to take this face...

37:46.099 --> 37:48.393
and burn it.

37:48.519 --> 37:52.523
Hey. I still
sound like me.

37:55.818 --> 37:59.822
I've implanted a microchip
on your larynx. It's fantastic,
but you'll have to be careful.

38:00.030 --> 38:03.784
Pressure, sharp blow,
even a violent sneeze could dislodge it.

38:03.951 --> 38:08.956
- Just repeat what you hear.
- Peach. I can eat a peach for hours.

38:09.122 --> 38:12.376
Peach. I can eat a peach
for hours.

38:13.710 --> 38:16.296
There's a scratchy tickle.

38:16.463 --> 38:20.884
Peach. I can eat a peach
for hours.

38:22.928 --> 38:26.014
Peach. I can eat a peach
for hours.

38:30.394 --> 38:34.898
- Once again.
- Peach. I can eat a peach for hours.

38:36.984 --> 38:40.487
- Perfect.
- Now, Sean, six days until the 18th.

38:40.654 --> 38:43.782
The clock's ticking,
and so is the bomb.

39:00.507 --> 39:03.177
You got two days
to get Pollux to talk.

39:03.343 --> 39:08.098
Either way, Miller comes in,
pulls you out. You got me?

39:12.477 --> 39:15.272
- What's the matter?
- Face itches.

39:19.067 --> 39:21.612
You all right?
Come on. Let's go.

39:25.491 --> 39:28.202
Archer's gonna be pissed when he comes
back from his training op and finds out.

39:28.368 --> 39:31.038
The guy is knee-deep
in Georgia swamp.

40:23.674 --> 40:27.427
You are now the property
of Erewhon Prison,

40:27.594 --> 40:30.430
a citizen of nowhere.

40:30.556 --> 40:33.642
The Geneva Convention
is void here.

40:33.851 --> 40:36.937
Amnesty International
doesn't know we exist.

40:37.104 --> 40:40.357
When I say
your ass belongs to me,

40:40.566 --> 40:42.860
I mean exactly that.

40:52.786 --> 40:55.455
This entire prison's
one big magnetic field.

40:55.539 --> 40:58.292
The boots tell us where you are.

40:58.458 --> 41:01.253
621 to Population!

42:19.706 --> 42:24.127
H-H-Hey, what's the matter, pal?
Don't you remember the little people?

42:26.630 --> 42:28.715
- Burke Hicks.
- Oh, yeah.

42:28.799 --> 42:31.802
I bust...

42:31.969 --> 42:34.972
believe Sean Archer busted you
for stalkin' the UN Secretary General.

42:35.097 --> 42:38.934
Oh, no. Archer framed me.
I ain't had nothin' to do with that.

42:39.059 --> 42:41.311
No... Word was you got wasted.

42:49.361 --> 42:52.656
You wanna see what wasted
looks like, little man?

42:56.994 --> 42:58.829
Pollux.

43:12.843 --> 43:15.304
Yeah!

43:21.768 --> 43:24.938
Out of the way. Central,
there's a disturbance in the population.

43:25.022 --> 43:27.774
- Go to lockdown.
- Hold that lockdown.

43:47.044 --> 43:49.838
Come on, you pussy!

43:55.052 --> 43:57.638
You watch your fuckin' mouth.

43:57.721 --> 44:00.557
You watch your fuckin' mouth!

44:10.734 --> 44:13.987
'Cause I'm Castor Troy! Yeah!

44:14.154 --> 44:17.407
I'm Castor Troy!

44:18.742 --> 44:21.745
- Castor! Castor!
- I'm Castor Troy!

44:21.912 --> 44:24.581
Yeah! Yeah!

44:29.169 --> 44:31.004
Yeah!

44:59.533 --> 45:01.785
Lock 'em down.

45:11.795 --> 45:15.132
I stop the fights, not you.

45:17.217 --> 45:22.389
That's two strikes for you, Dubov.
One more, you know where you're goin'.

45:22.514 --> 45:25.475
- When I get out of here...
- If you get out of here...

45:27.144 --> 45:30.314
I'm gonna have you fired.

46:48.559 --> 46:51.144
Lars, it's me.

46:52.312 --> 46:54.398
Believe it.

46:54.565 --> 46:56.984
Someone...

46:57.151 --> 47:00.904
They took... switched my... wh...

47:01.071 --> 47:03.157
F... Some fucking...

47:06.410 --> 47:09.913
But it's cool.
We're gonna deal with it.

47:17.754 --> 47:21.341
Oh, yes, we're gonna deal
with it.

47:50.787 --> 47:54.208
- What's this about?
- Dr Walsh.

47:54.291 --> 47:57.544
I was just, uh, enjoying some
of your greatest hits here.

47:57.628 --> 48:00.547
Oh-Oh, I hope you don't mind.
I-I, uh, I partook...

48:00.714 --> 48:03.550
of your groovy, uh...
your groovy painkillers.

48:03.717 --> 48:08.639
You know, this is fabulous work.
This is... This is... Oh, bravo.

48:10.057 --> 48:12.976
Bra-fucking-vo.

48:13.143 --> 48:17.147
Oh, God. This is excellent.
Bravo.

48:17.314 --> 48:19.733
- Bravo.
- What do you want?

48:25.322 --> 48:28.325
Take one goddam guess.

48:35.999 --> 48:40.087
I wish they'd play some of those
salmon spawning scenes again.
I found them intensely erotic.

48:41.171 --> 48:43.757
Fuckin' nature channel.

48:43.924 --> 48:47.594
One more waterfall,
I'm gonna foam at the mouth.

48:47.678 --> 48:51.014
It's like
they're begging us to riot.

48:51.181 --> 48:53.016
Excuse me.

48:57.354 --> 48:59.690
Not feeling very coordinated
lately, are you?

49:02.526 --> 49:06.947
Look, bro, you gotta help me.

49:07.114 --> 49:09.950
I am so fried.

49:10.117 --> 49:15.539
If the psychos in here
find out I'm misfiring,
we're both gonna be dead meat.

49:15.706 --> 49:17.958
Shock treatment?
What's the matter with you?

49:18.125 --> 49:20.210
Did they operate?

49:20.377 --> 49:24.047
I was in a coma. Jesus, you're
still so fuckin' paranoid.

49:24.214 --> 49:26.049
Aren't they giving you
your medication in here?

49:26.216 --> 49:28.719
What was my medication?

49:32.806 --> 49:36.476
Pollux, I hand-fed you
those pills for years.

49:36.560 --> 49:39.563
Vivex. I haven't forgotten that.

49:39.730 --> 49:42.483
It's just everything else.
It's...

49:42.649 --> 49:46.570
senses, my reflexes, my memory.

49:46.737 --> 49:50.324
It's like a tab of bad Quantrex.

49:50.491 --> 49:54.828
I don't even know why that fucking Yeti
jumped me yesterday.

49:54.995 --> 49:57.164
Dubov?

49:57.331 --> 50:02.503
You had a sex sandwich with his wife and
his sister the night he was sent here.

50:02.586 --> 50:06.507
I guess that explains
why he's so upset.

50:06.673 --> 50:08.592
Wow.

50:10.928 --> 50:14.348
We're gonna blow up LA, bro.
Ain't it cool?

50:14.515 --> 50:17.017
Oh, right. Rub my nose
in it, why don't you?

50:17.184 --> 50:22.606
$10 million design, and now those
militia nutjobs get to keep their cash.

50:22.773 --> 50:24.691
It's so fucking unfair.

50:26.193 --> 50:30.197
That bomb you built
does deserve an audience.

50:30.280 --> 50:32.616
It's a work of art.

50:32.783 --> 50:35.118
It belongs in the Louvre.

50:35.285 --> 50:39.206
Yes, it does. Oh, well.

50:39.289 --> 50:42.459
I guess the LA Convention
Centre'll have to do.

50:52.219 --> 50:54.638
- What?
- Thank you.

50:54.805 --> 50:56.557
For what?

50:58.308 --> 51:00.644
You are so fucking pathetic.

51:18.495 --> 51:20.581
You got a visitor.

52:26.563 --> 52:30.734
Ooh-wee, you good-lookin'.
You're hot!

52:34.071 --> 52:37.991
It's like looking
in a mirror, only not.

52:42.079 --> 52:45.999
- Troy?
- Now that is between us, okay?

52:46.166 --> 52:49.670
- But you were...
- In a coma?

52:49.837 --> 52:54.341
Nothing like having your face
cut off to disturb your sleep.
Read the newspaper lately?

52:58.929 --> 53:02.933
- You killed them?
- Well, beats paying the bill, huh?

53:03.100 --> 53:06.687
Come on. I mean, uh, if
a face-lift costs five grand...

53:06.854 --> 53:09.523
See anything you like?

53:15.195 --> 53:16.864
Tito.

53:26.957 --> 53:29.793
I torched all the evidence
that proves you're you, okay?

53:29.960 --> 53:34.715
So, wow, looks like you're gonna be
in here for the next hundred years!

53:37.301 --> 53:39.636
Now, I have got to go.

53:39.803 --> 53:45.225
I've got a government job to
abuse and a lonely wife to fuck.

53:45.309 --> 53:47.895
Oh, did I say that?
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't say that.

53:47.978 --> 53:50.147
Make love to.

53:50.314 --> 53:52.983
Oh, God, I miss that face.

53:54.902 --> 53:57.571
Die!

53:57.738 --> 54:00.741
Die!

54:07.664 --> 54:11.835
- Sorry, Agent Archer.
- No, don't you worry about it,
Mr Walton.

54:12.002 --> 54:15.255
Clearly he's, uh, had
a traumatic childhood,

54:15.422 --> 54:17.841
and, uh, thank you.

54:20.511 --> 54:24.765
What's givin' you the will
to live is lookin' for revenge

54:24.848 --> 54:30.270
Look at this place. I'm in hell.

54:30.437 --> 54:33.106
I may never get
a hard-on again.

54:36.860 --> 54:40.864
Don't lose your head

54:48.121 --> 54:50.457
Oh, yes.

54:50.624 --> 54:52.793
There we go.

55:10.394 --> 55:14.731
Well, I suppose it was only a matter of
time before you forgot where we lived.

55:15.899 --> 55:18.152
Come on. Give me a break.

55:18.318 --> 55:23.490
Every house in this block looks
the same. Then I spotted you.

55:23.657 --> 55:25.659
Eve.

55:25.826 --> 55:28.495
My one and only Eve.

55:28.579 --> 55:31.248
So how was your
vital assignment?

55:31.415 --> 55:34.001
Which one was that?

55:34.168 --> 55:37.171
How should I know, Sean?

55:37.254 --> 55:41.425
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh, yes. The, um...
the out of body experience.

55:41.592 --> 55:43.677
Yes. That one.

55:45.179 --> 55:49.016
- Where you goin'?
- To the hospital.

55:49.099 --> 55:53.520
- No. No. What's the matter?
- Sean, come on.

55:53.687 --> 55:56.690
- Oh, what?
- Quit teasing me. Stop it.
I'm still really hurt, okay?

55:56.857 --> 55:59.943
- There are leftovers in the fridge.
- No, no.

56:00.110 --> 56:03.780
I want to stay hungry
for you, my peach.

56:03.947 --> 56:06.116
- Give me that tongue.
- Sean, come on.

56:06.283 --> 56:08.952
- What are you doing?
What are you doing?
- What does Evie want?

56:09.119 --> 56:13.624
Eve, I hate to see you go,
but I love to watch you leave.

56:46.990 --> 56:49.576
"Date night fizzled again.

56:49.660 --> 56:52.412
We haven't made love
in two months."

56:53.580 --> 56:55.415
What a loser.

56:58.502 --> 57:01.839
Come here, sister

57:02.005 --> 57:05.592
- Papa's in the swing
- Got your E-mail, Karl.

57:05.676 --> 57:08.762
- The poem you sent me was pretty kinky.
- He ain't too hip

57:08.929 --> 57:12.599
About that new-breed babe

57:12.683 --> 57:16.353
- The plot thickens.
- He ain't no drag

57:16.520 --> 57:21.108
- Papa's got a brand new bag
- Hang on a second.

57:21.275 --> 57:23.944
- Come here, Mama
- I'll have to call you back.

57:24.111 --> 57:27.531
- And dig this crazy scene
- You're not respecting my boundaries.

57:27.698 --> 57:31.451
- I'm coming in, Janie.
- He's not too fancy
- Janie?

57:31.618 --> 57:35.706
- But this line is pretty clean
- I don't think you heard me, Jamie.

57:35.873 --> 57:38.876
- He ain't no drag
- You got something that I crave.

57:39.042 --> 57:41.712
Papa's got a brand new bag

57:43.964 --> 57:47.134
He's doin' the jerk
He's doin' the fly

57:47.301 --> 57:49.636
- Don't play him cheap
'cause you know he ain't shy
- Clarissa left those here.

57:49.803 --> 57:52.639
- Well, I won't tell Mom
if you don't.
- He's doin' the Monkey

57:52.723 --> 57:55.726
- The Mashed Potato, Jump-back Jack
- When did you start smoking?

57:55.893 --> 58:01.482
- See you later, alligator
- You'll be seeing a lot
of changes around here.

58:01.648 --> 58:05.903
- Papa's in the swing
- Papa's got a brand new bag. Ow!

58:06.069 --> 58:08.989
He ain't too hip now

58:09.072 --> 58:13.160
- But I can dig that new breed
- I can do the j... do the s...

58:13.327 --> 58:16.747
He's doin' the twist
just like this

58:32.846 --> 58:36.266
Bye, bro.
Drop me a line sometime.

58:39.019 --> 58:42.022
Gonna be kind of lonely
with Pollux gone, huh?

58:42.189 --> 58:44.191
Po... Pollux what?

58:44.358 --> 58:48.529
That big-shit cop, Archer, cut him
a deal for turnin' state's evidence.

58:48.695 --> 58:51.615
Your brother's been released.

58:54.618 --> 58:58.622
I'm Sean Archer. There is a bomb
at the LA Convention Centre.

58:58.789 --> 59:01.208
I'm Sean Archer and... Ow!

59:16.223 --> 59:20.227
Tiramisu, tiramisu

59:22.896 --> 59:26.567
- Sir, we just wanted you to know...
- We're all really sorry about Tito.

59:26.733 --> 59:29.403
Oh, hey, shit happens, you know?

59:29.486 --> 59:32.239
So is our star witness talking?

59:32.406 --> 59:36.243
Yeah. About what kind of mustard
he likes on his tongue sandwiches.

59:36.410 --> 59:40.247
If that bomb is out there,
we're almost out of time.

59:40.414 --> 59:42.416
Archer!

59:44.168 --> 59:47.671
You made the deal with Pollux Troy.
That isn't like you.

59:47.838 --> 59:51.425
Well, when all else fails,
fresh tactics.

59:51.592 --> 59:53.510
Fresh? Well, let me tell you
my fresh tactic.

59:53.677 --> 59:57.264
From now on everything to do with
this case goes through me, understood?

59:57.431 --> 59:59.850
Good. Thanks.

01:00:13.614 --> 01:00:16.700
You're supposed to be snitching
and making me look good.

01:00:16.867 --> 01:00:20.037
- Look good?
- Mm-hmm.

01:00:20.204 --> 01:00:24.625
Seeing that face on you makes me afraid
my tiramisu might come back up.

01:00:24.708 --> 01:00:29.796
Well, think about me. This nose.
This hair. This ridiculous chin.

01:00:31.632 --> 01:00:33.717
Brother, we're going straight.

01:00:33.884 --> 01:00:37.804
Oh, my goodness. Did you
exchange brains as well?

01:00:37.971 --> 01:00:41.975
The first thing I need you to confess to
is the location of the bomb.

01:00:42.059 --> 01:00:43.977
What about our $10 million?

01:00:44.144 --> 01:00:49.149
What about when I become
an American hero for defusing
the bomb? What's that worth?

01:00:49.316 --> 01:00:52.736
Know that. Thank you.
Next question.

01:00:56.573 --> 01:01:00.244
- You're not the only one
in the family with brains.
- No.

01:01:00.410 --> 01:01:04.248
- Although now I am
the only one with the looks.
- Touche.

01:01:05.666 --> 01:01:08.836
This is an emergency evacuation.

01:01:11.588 --> 01:01:13.924
This is an emergency evacuation.

01:01:14.091 --> 01:01:17.761
Let's go. Police. Go! Go!

01:01:31.275 --> 01:01:35.028
- Any ideas?
- Yeah, run.

01:01:35.112 --> 01:01:39.533
Sir, it's protected by a tamper switch,
and it'll take us hours to bypass.

01:01:42.119 --> 01:01:45.539
- Evacuate your team, Captain.
- No, but, sir, we can't...
we can't disarm.

01:01:45.622 --> 01:01:47.541
Leave.

01:02:04.892 --> 01:02:10.063
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah

01:02:10.147 --> 01:02:12.399
Hallelujah

01:02:12.483 --> 01:02:15.652
Ha-Ha. Ha, ha, ha.

01:02:23.243 --> 01:02:25.245
Oh, baby. Oh...

01:02:29.166 --> 01:02:31.668
That was the scene
at the LA Convention Centre,

01:02:31.835 --> 01:02:34.838
where an FBI agent became
a city saviour.

01:02:35.005 --> 01:02:40.761
Sean Archer disarmed a massive bomb just
one second before it was set to blow.

01:02:40.844 --> 01:02:45.516
The apparent targets were
three Supreme Court justices
scheduled to speak here today...

01:02:45.682 --> 01:02:48.769
and anyone unlucky enough to be
within a mile of the scene.

01:02:48.852 --> 01:02:53.607
We asked Agent Archer if the FBI had
any leads on who planted the device.

01:02:53.774 --> 01:02:56.360
Well, that is, uh,
classified information.

01:02:56.527 --> 01:03:00.614
But if he... If he's listening,
I wouldn't mind giving him a message:

01:03:00.781 --> 01:03:03.951
Interception. Now our side's got
the ball. Sorry.

01:03:47.661 --> 01:03:49.746
Wanda? Everybody.

01:03:49.913 --> 01:03:55.669
Hey, look, I...
I wanna thank you for, uh,

01:03:55.836 --> 01:04:01.341
enduring all these years
that I was an insufferable bore.

01:04:01.425 --> 01:04:04.178
Sir, did you just have
a surgical procedure?

01:04:05.762 --> 01:04:07.848
- What do you mean?
- Well, was the stick...

01:04:07.931 --> 01:04:10.767
successfully removed
from your ass?

01:04:14.188 --> 01:04:17.274
Sir. The White House on one.

01:04:17.441 --> 01:04:19.943
It's the president.
Oh, and your wife on line two.

01:04:20.110 --> 01:04:22.613
- Well, you tell the president to hold.
- Okay.

01:04:54.645 --> 01:04:56.730
- I got it.
- Sean, you scared the hell out of me.

01:04:56.897 --> 01:04:59.733
- It's date night.
- Oh, my God.

01:04:59.817 --> 01:05:02.319
Oh, congratulations.

01:05:02.486 --> 01:05:04.738
Oh, big deal.

01:05:07.241 --> 01:05:10.410
Okay, I said, uh,
"Mr President,

01:05:10.577 --> 01:05:13.247
"I want the authority...

01:05:13.413 --> 01:05:15.749
"and I want the funds
and the personnel...

01:05:15.916 --> 01:05:19.002
to take over the whole gamut
of global terrorism," right?

01:05:21.672 --> 01:05:26.760
And he said, "The next name
on my calling list is Lazarro,

01:05:26.927 --> 01:05:32.432
and I'm telling him that Sean Archer
writes his own ticket," okay?

01:05:35.352 --> 01:05:37.521
What's the matter?

01:05:37.688 --> 01:05:39.690
I... I don't know, Sean.
You just...

01:05:39.857 --> 01:05:44.778
You just seem so different.
I mean, what is th... all this about?

01:05:44.945 --> 01:05:49.449
What... This intimate
candlelight dinner? Huh?

01:05:49.616 --> 01:05:52.870
And I'm supposed to forget
all the promises 'cause
you're going back into the fray?

01:06:13.474 --> 01:06:16.977
If the top cop in this country
can't come home...

01:06:17.144 --> 01:06:22.065
every night to his wife,
then the hell with the country.

01:06:22.232 --> 01:06:27.321
Because the only place
I'm going is upstairs with you.

01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:46.006
Exercise. One hour.

01:06:56.099 --> 01:06:58.685
How can I get out of here?

01:06:58.852 --> 01:07:00.854
You can't.

01:07:01.939 --> 01:07:03.857
How can I get these boots off?

01:07:03.941 --> 01:07:06.193
They only take 'em off
in the clinic.

01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:08.612
Right before
they fry your skull.

01:07:19.540 --> 01:07:21.375
Hey.

01:07:23.794 --> 01:07:26.797
- I'm out of cigarettes.
- Get back in line, Troy.

01:07:29.550 --> 01:07:31.969
I said I'm out of cigarettes.

01:07:39.726 --> 01:07:41.812
Kick his ass!

01:07:47.151 --> 01:07:49.570
Hey, what the hell!
That's not right!

01:07:59.663 --> 01:08:02.916
I need a light! I need a light!

01:08:03.083 --> 01:08:05.169
- Anybody got a light?
- All right!

01:08:05.335 --> 01:08:08.755
Anybody got a light?
Got a light?

01:08:21.350 --> 01:08:24.104
You better bring the bastard down
before he chokes himself to death.

01:08:40.703 --> 01:08:43.790
Well, happy day,
it's Castor Troy.

01:08:47.294 --> 01:08:50.796
Wait. H-Hold it, hold it.
Can I, uh... Can I have a light?

01:08:50.881 --> 01:08:53.050
You know, those things'll kill you.

01:08:54.218 --> 01:08:56.970
Get his boots, Walton.

01:09:03.060 --> 01:09:07.064
Dubov, I didn't touch your wife.

01:09:07.231 --> 01:09:10.984
And I didn't touch your sister.

01:09:11.109 --> 01:09:15.738
But I know your wife loves you,
is waiting for you.

01:09:15.906 --> 01:09:18.158
So let's get out of here.

01:09:18.325 --> 01:09:20.410
You're more brain-dead than Dubov.

01:09:26.667 --> 01:09:28.752
- Out.
- Out.

01:09:28.919 --> 01:09:31.505
- Get him!
- Grab his arms!

01:09:31.671 --> 01:09:33.756
Look out!

01:09:40.848 --> 01:09:44.518
Shots have been fired.
We have men down in C-4.

01:09:44.643 --> 01:09:47.145
- I got 'em.
- Throw 'em down!

01:10:04.955 --> 01:10:07.332
Move!

01:10:28.604 --> 01:10:30.856
Get down!

01:10:56.548 --> 01:10:59.718
Dubov! No!

01:11:01.053 --> 01:11:03.347
Get out.

01:11:50.519 --> 01:11:52.938
Dubov!

01:11:56.984 --> 01:12:00.445
Now, give me your hand.

01:12:00.612 --> 01:12:02.823
Come on.

01:12:02.948 --> 01:12:05.450
You can do it.

01:12:11.623 --> 01:12:13.542
No!

01:12:47.117 --> 01:12:50.287
No. No.

01:12:50.454 --> 01:12:52.247
No!

01:14:12.703 --> 01:14:16.165
Sean! Wait!

01:14:18.750 --> 01:14:21.211
- What are you doing?
- Uh, I'm sorry.

01:14:24.006 --> 01:14:26.633
- Have a nice day.
- Have a nice day?

01:14:26.758 --> 01:14:31.221
What is with you? Is this your way
of just not dealing with this morning?

01:14:32.431 --> 01:14:34.391
Yeah. Yeah, maybe.

01:14:35.934 --> 01:14:39.271
Sean! Sean!

01:14:39.396 --> 01:14:44.359
I know it's hard for you, but it's hard
for me too, and we still have to go.

01:15:13.013 --> 01:15:15.432
Happy birthday, Mikey.

01:15:21.438 --> 01:15:25.025
He took our baby, Sean.
He took our little boy.

01:15:37.496 --> 01:15:39.665
You turned your beeper off.

01:15:39.790 --> 01:15:42.459
Yes, well... my son's birthday.

01:15:42.584 --> 01:15:44.962
Well, uh, here's
some poetic justice, sir.

01:15:45.087 --> 01:15:50.008
- Castor Troy is dead.
- He got killed trying to escape
from Erewhon.

01:15:50.133 --> 01:15:53.470
Where's his body?
I-I wanna see his body.

01:15:53.554 --> 01:15:58.392
- It hasn't been recovered yet.
- It hasn't been recovered yet?

01:15:58.517 --> 01:16:01.145
Get the LAPD on this!

01:16:01.270 --> 01:16:04.606
Even if he is alive, Castor isn't
stupid enough to come back to the city.

01:16:07.526 --> 01:16:11.989
You must... You must trust me.
He's already here.

01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:57.075
County General.
How may I direct your call?

01:16:57.201 --> 01:16:59.369
Dr Archer, please.
It's an emergency.

01:16:59.453 --> 01:17:02.748
- May I say who's calling?
- Her husband.

01:17:02.873 --> 01:17:05.667
Dr Archer, call on line three.

01:17:09.087 --> 01:17:11.673
I know this sounds crazy,
but... Shit!

01:17:13.342 --> 01:17:15.844
- Sean?
- Eve, listen carefully.

01:17:15.928 --> 01:17:18.430
The man you think is
your husband isn't.

01:17:18.555 --> 01:17:20.808
- Who is this?
- Please, just listen.

01:17:20.933 --> 01:17:25.229
Take Jamie. Go to your mother's. Don't
tell him where you're going, just go.

01:17:25.312 --> 01:17:28.315
Uh, whoever you are,
don't call again.

01:17:38.450 --> 01:17:41.578
- Operations.
- I need Victor Lazarro immediately.

01:17:41.703 --> 01:17:44.456
- Regarding?
- I have information about Castor Troy.

01:17:44.581 --> 01:17:48.085
I'll transfer you, sir.

01:17:48.210 --> 01:17:50.879
Sean Archer here. Who's calling?

01:17:50.963 --> 01:17:54.800
Well, if you're Sean Archer,
I guess I'm Castor Troy.

01:18:02.266 --> 01:18:04.601
Ah, yes.

01:18:04.685 --> 01:18:08.063
This escaped convict is
considered extremely dangerous.

01:18:08.147 --> 01:18:12.192
If you have any information concerning
the whereabouts of Castor Troy...

01:18:27.416 --> 01:18:30.335
You goddam right. Yeah!

01:18:30.460 --> 01:18:32.546
This shit's so good,
gonna make your dick hard.

01:18:32.671 --> 01:18:35.632
Huh? Cheryl? Cheryl's a liar.

01:18:35.757 --> 01:18:37.801
Dietrich.

01:18:39.553 --> 01:18:43.724
So you're still selling hops
and drugs to Cheryl and Phil Roy.

01:18:47.519 --> 01:18:49.480
Castor fucking Troy!

01:18:49.563 --> 01:18:52.232
Aw, man. You scared me, man!

01:18:52.357 --> 01:18:55.152
All right. All right.

01:18:55.277 --> 01:18:58.530
You know, I never should've sold
you those bombs. It's my curse.
I can't say no to a friend.

01:18:58.655 --> 01:19:00.657
- You can't say no to money.
- Yeah, that's my other curse.

01:19:00.782 --> 01:19:02.993
- You drug dealer.
- What's the matter?

01:19:03.118 --> 01:19:05.078
- What?
- You look like you just fucked
your mother. Come on.

01:19:05.204 --> 01:19:07.998
Let's go relax, huh?

01:19:16.381 --> 01:19:18.842
Hey!

01:19:22.221 --> 01:19:24.348
- Hey, Castor.
- Oh, Castor Troy!

01:19:24.431 --> 01:19:27.267
I don't believe this.
Castor Troy!

01:19:27.392 --> 01:19:31.647
What are you doing?

01:19:31.730 --> 01:19:34.191
Wanna hit?

01:19:34.274 --> 01:19:38.278
Hey, baby. Remember me?
I'm your favourite peach.

01:19:40.364 --> 01:19:42.407
Oh, I thought
I was your favourite.

01:19:44.451 --> 01:19:47.955
- You make me crazy
- Look at this guy.

01:19:48.038 --> 01:19:50.541
You know, you look pretty good
for a dead guy.

01:19:50.582 --> 01:19:52.918
Hey!

01:19:57.714 --> 01:20:00.092
- Mescal.
- Two?
- Yeah.

01:20:03.387 --> 01:20:05.681
So what do you wanna do?

01:20:14.898 --> 01:20:17.151
You wanna get out
of the country?

01:20:17.234 --> 01:20:21.280
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm gonna get Sean Archer.

01:20:22.447 --> 01:20:24.992
With your help.

01:20:25.075 --> 01:20:28.495
Okay.

01:20:35.752 --> 01:20:37.629
Welcome home, baby.

01:20:52.519 --> 01:20:54.730
How we supposed to do that?

01:20:56.648 --> 01:20:58.901
He's vulnerable at home.

01:20:58.984 --> 01:21:02.070
No. I mean, this is
Sean Archer we're talkin' about.

01:21:02.154 --> 01:21:04.740
- This isn't just some Boy Scout.
- Fitch.

01:21:04.865 --> 01:21:08.243
No. Besides, his house is
probably alarmed up the wazoo.

01:21:08.327 --> 01:21:10.496
The code is 10-19-86.

01:21:10.621 --> 01:21:14.208
That's his dead son's birthday.

01:21:14.291 --> 01:21:16.919
Don't it just break your heart?

01:21:19.296 --> 01:21:23.175
- That's brilliant.
- That's sick.

01:21:24.843 --> 01:21:28.639
How is it that you know
so much about Sean Archer?

01:21:28.764 --> 01:21:32.309
Uh... I, uh...

01:21:32.434 --> 01:21:34.937
sleep with his wife.

01:21:40.484 --> 01:21:42.361
Well.

01:21:56.834 --> 01:21:59.294
This is gra... This is great.

01:21:59.378 --> 01:22:03.882
So, once we kidnap supercop,
then what?

01:22:07.636 --> 01:22:09.972
Tiny...

01:22:10.097 --> 01:22:12.349
surgery.

01:22:13.725 --> 01:22:17.688
I'd like to take his...
his face...

01:22:17.813 --> 01:22:20.482
off.

01:22:20.566 --> 01:22:23.318
Yes.

01:22:23.402 --> 01:22:25.487
Now, if you'll excuse me,

01:22:25.612 --> 01:22:30.868
I have to use
the little boy's wee-wee room.

01:22:35.747 --> 01:22:37.666
Cas.

01:22:39.209 --> 01:22:42.254
You wanna take his face...

01:22:42.379 --> 01:22:47.009
Yes. His face off.

01:22:47.092 --> 01:22:49.344
Eyes.

01:22:49.470 --> 01:22:52.014
Nose. Skin.

01:22:52.097 --> 01:22:55.684
It's coming off.

01:22:55.767 --> 01:22:57.853
The face...

01:22:59.855 --> 01:23:02.191
off.

01:23:06.862 --> 01:23:09.615
No more drugs
for that man.

01:23:41.939 --> 01:23:44.233
I'm not me.

01:23:44.316 --> 01:23:46.485
I'm me.

01:23:46.610 --> 01:23:48.904
Not me.
Me.

01:23:51.824 --> 01:23:54.409
Castor Archer.

01:23:55.953 --> 01:23:57.871
Castor Archer.

01:24:11.301 --> 01:24:13.762
I thought you were dead.

01:24:13.887 --> 01:24:16.640
I'm not dead.
I'm me.

01:24:20.727 --> 01:24:22.855
No, no, no. Look. What I... What
I'm trying to tell you, brother,

01:24:22.980 --> 01:24:26.191
Pollux, is once we get the
full protection and resources...

01:24:26.316 --> 01:24:29.736
of the government to help us
get rid of our rivals, right?

01:24:29.820 --> 01:24:32.114
Then we'll be set.

01:24:32.197 --> 01:24:35.242
Then maybe, just maybe, I'll
get my frickin' face back.

01:24:35.325 --> 01:24:38.787
Then I'll just have one jag-off
to take care of.

01:24:44.793 --> 01:24:49.673
- Hey, where ya goin'? Where ya goin'?
- Karl, stop it.

01:24:49.798 --> 01:24:51.717
- Maybe two. Hold on.
- Karl, stop it!

01:24:51.842 --> 01:24:53.802
- Calm down, would ya? Calm down.
- Karl!

01:24:53.927 --> 01:24:55.888
Karl, my dad's home!
Let go!

01:24:56.013 --> 01:24:57.973
- Happy hunting. I'll catch ya later.
- Stop it!

01:24:58.098 --> 01:25:01.852
Yeah, like Mr Fuckin' Invisible
gives a shit about you anyway.
So fuckin' hold still.

01:25:01.977 --> 01:25:03.896
Calm down!

01:25:20.704 --> 01:25:22.456
- Okay, say you're sorry.
- I'm sorry.

01:25:22.539 --> 01:25:24.041
- I didn't hear it.
- I'm sorry!

01:25:24.166 --> 01:25:25.959
- Mean it.
- I'm so sorry!

01:25:37.805 --> 01:25:42.893
Dress up like Halloween and
ghouls will try to get in your pants.

01:25:43.018 --> 01:25:47.189
Typical, Dad. Some guy tries
to rape me, and I'm to blame?

01:26:02.579 --> 01:26:05.999
This isn't you.

01:26:06.083 --> 01:26:09.127
Now you haven't been the same
since Mike died.

01:26:09.253 --> 01:26:13.132
Hiding behind
someone else's face.

01:26:13.257 --> 01:26:16.885
Hoping you wouldn't
feel the pain.

01:26:16.969 --> 01:26:21.723
While we're talking,
do you have protection?

01:26:21.807 --> 01:26:23.559
What? You mean
like condoms?

01:26:29.606 --> 01:26:31.316
Protection.

01:26:33.485 --> 01:26:37.781
Next time, let Karl
take his pants down.

01:26:37.865 --> 01:26:41.493
Slip this in his thigh, twist
it so the wound won't close.

01:26:54.339 --> 01:26:56.800
Now go on.
Get outta here.

01:27:03.056 --> 01:27:04.391
I am the king.

01:27:12.649 --> 01:27:14.818
Eve.

01:27:19.948 --> 01:27:22.326
Jesus, Cas!
It's me!

01:27:24.077 --> 01:27:26.038
It's me.

01:27:27.539 --> 01:27:31.001
Cas. Shh.

01:27:31.084 --> 01:27:36.423
Come on.
It's me. Jesus.

01:27:39.635 --> 01:27:41.512
Come on.

01:27:41.595 --> 01:27:44.723
- Don't you wanna talk?
- The only talk I ever heard
from you is...

01:27:44.848 --> 01:27:47.935
"Suck my tongue," "I love
your ass," and "See ya,"

01:27:48.060 --> 01:27:51.188
and "Take the filthy shit off,"
"Put this on and get outta here."

01:27:51.313 --> 01:27:54.358
- No, I'm not goin' anywhere.
- Oh, really?

01:27:54.441 --> 01:27:56.276
What do you... What do you
expect me, after all this time...

01:27:56.401 --> 01:27:59.363
Just to... Just to
jump on you?

01:27:59.488 --> 01:28:01.532
- That's not what I...
- Is that what you expect?

01:28:01.615 --> 01:28:03.450
- That's not what I meant.
- What did you mean?

01:28:03.575 --> 01:28:07.037
- I meant...
- Huh? Is this what you meant?

01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:10.666
That? That? How about this?
Is that good? Huh?

01:28:17.381 --> 01:28:19.216
- Sean Archer.
- Bro.

01:28:19.341 --> 01:28:22.386
Well, I figured he might drop in
on some of our old friends.

01:28:22.469 --> 01:28:26.765
And if my eyes don't deceive,
I think this fellow's
beginning to enjoy being you.

01:28:27.933 --> 01:28:29.810
Good.

01:28:36.650 --> 01:28:40.154
Look, look, look. Okay.
L-Look, Sasha.

01:28:41.905 --> 01:28:45.325
What I meant is, uh, that
I'm not going anywhere...

01:28:45.450 --> 01:28:48.203
until your brother
helps me, uh, first.

01:28:50.873 --> 01:28:54.168
Cas. If the FBI finds out
that you were here,

01:28:54.293 --> 01:28:56.962
I'll lose my son.

01:28:57.087 --> 01:28:58.964
Please, Cas,
you just gotta go.

01:29:05.554 --> 01:29:08.557
I've said and done some things
that have made your life harder.

01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:11.268
- I know.
- How would you?

01:29:11.351 --> 01:29:13.770
When you left,
you never looked back.

01:29:13.854 --> 01:29:15.772
I... I just know.

01:29:27.618 --> 01:29:31.788
Look, Sasha, I'm not
the same person you remember.

01:29:31.914 --> 01:29:34.333
And for what it's worth,
I'm sorry.

01:29:40.714 --> 01:29:43.342
- They're nice-looking clothes.
- Yeah, of course. They're yours.

01:29:43.467 --> 01:29:46.261
Look, I know, I...

01:29:46.345 --> 01:29:48.514
just like 'em.

01:29:49.765 --> 01:29:53.477
That's a nice-lookin' kid too.

01:29:53.602 --> 01:29:55.979
Yeah. Of course.

01:29:57.856 --> 01:30:00.150
He's yours too.

01:30:19.253 --> 01:30:21.755
- How old is he?
- Five.

01:30:23.549 --> 01:30:26.009
Nobody knows he's yours.
I was...

01:30:26.135 --> 01:30:29.596
scared someone would try
to hurt him just to hurt you.

01:30:29.721 --> 01:30:32.391
Adam. Adam.

01:30:32.516 --> 01:30:35.853
Don't want you playing with those
things. They are very, very dangerous.

01:30:35.978 --> 01:30:40.232
Okay? Now come on, sweetie.

01:30:40.357 --> 01:30:44.278
I want you to meet
your father.

01:30:44.403 --> 01:30:47.739
Look at him.
It's okay. Say hi.

01:30:47.865 --> 01:30:49.741
Hi.

01:31:06.049 --> 01:31:08.594
Hi.

01:31:12.139 --> 01:31:15.058
Michael.

01:31:15.142 --> 01:31:18.187
- Michael. Michael?
- Cas.

01:31:18.270 --> 01:31:21.398
- Cas. Cas, you're scaring him.
- Michael?

01:31:21.523 --> 01:31:24.401
Let him go.

01:31:24.526 --> 01:31:27.279
What is the matter
with you?

01:31:30.532 --> 01:31:32.784
Get down!

01:31:44.087 --> 01:31:46.673
Okay, Red Team!
Red Team, break off!

01:31:46.799 --> 01:31:50.219
How'd you get to be so brave?
How'd you get to be so brave?

01:31:52.888 --> 01:31:54.932
- Come out now with your hands up!
- Put these on.

01:31:55.015 --> 01:31:58.227
Okay. That's a good idea,
baby. Listen to your music.

01:31:58.310 --> 01:31:59.937
- Come on.
- Come out now!

01:32:00.062 --> 01:32:02.481
Somewhere

01:32:02.606 --> 01:32:04.274
- Go! Go! Go!
- We have a warrant for your arrest!

01:32:06.193 --> 01:32:08.654
Cops.

01:32:10.906 --> 01:32:13.742
I hate cops.

01:32:13.826 --> 01:32:16.328
Come on, kid.

01:32:23.836 --> 01:32:28.132
- Move! Move!
- Go left, left!
First door to the right!

01:32:33.554 --> 01:32:35.055
Go! Go! Go!

01:32:36.348 --> 01:32:37.850
Go! Go!

01:32:50.737 --> 01:32:53.657
Someday I'll wish
upon a star

01:32:53.740 --> 01:32:56.785
- And wake up...
- Let's get outta here! Come on.

01:32:57.870 --> 01:32:59.580
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

01:33:13.302 --> 01:33:14.928
Damn, my place
is gettin' fucked up.

01:33:25.230 --> 01:33:26.857
Take him.

01:33:36.575 --> 01:33:39.244
Cas! Cas,
give me the boy!

01:33:42.831 --> 01:33:46.460
Really? Really?
Come on! Shit!

01:33:48.295 --> 01:33:50.839
Come on, come on!
Let's go! Go, go, go!

01:33:57.304 --> 01:33:59.223
Cas, be careful
with him!

01:34:09.107 --> 01:34:12.861
- Don't be scared, All right? All right?
- Somewhere

01:34:12.945 --> 01:34:18.867
Over the rainbow

01:34:18.951 --> 01:34:24.915
Skies are blue

01:34:27.960 --> 01:34:30.754
And the dreams

01:34:30.838 --> 01:34:34.967
That you dared to dream

01:34:35.092 --> 01:34:41.306
Really do come true

01:34:41.431 --> 01:34:45.269
Someday I'll wish
upon a star

01:34:45.394 --> 01:34:48.313
And wake up
where the clouds

01:34:48.438 --> 01:34:52.109
- Are far behind
- Adam!

01:34:52.192 --> 01:34:55.737
Me

01:34:56.780 --> 01:35:03.912
Birds fly over the rainbow

01:35:03.996 --> 01:35:07.124
Why then, oh, why

01:35:07.207 --> 01:35:11.462
Can't I

01:35:11.545 --> 01:35:14.173
Adam! Adam!

01:35:15.466 --> 01:35:18.218
Get him out back!
Go, go, go!

01:35:21.972 --> 01:35:23.640
Put the boy down.

01:35:23.765 --> 01:35:26.477
Honey, sweetie,
don't touch that.

01:35:26.602 --> 01:35:28.145
It isn't nice!

01:35:28.270 --> 01:35:30.314
I don't ever
wanna see you do that.

01:35:33.567 --> 01:35:36.111
They're like cockroaches!

01:35:36.236 --> 01:35:38.155
Hey. Drop it.

01:35:39.656 --> 01:35:41.575
That's it.

01:35:43.869 --> 01:35:45.579
Buzz.

01:35:45.662 --> 01:35:47.164
Hey!

01:35:52.294 --> 01:35:54.338
Told him
not to fuck with me.

01:36:40.717 --> 01:36:42.678
Take the boy
and get outta here.

01:36:42.761 --> 01:36:44.680
- Are you all right?
- Go!

01:36:49.685 --> 01:36:51.812
Hurry up.

01:36:57.234 --> 01:37:00.195
Hey, man.

01:37:00.320 --> 01:37:02.948
We had some good times,
didn't we?

01:37:37.816 --> 01:37:42.237
I don't know what I hate
wearing worse:

01:37:42.362 --> 01:37:44.573
Your face or your body.

01:37:46.825 --> 01:37:49.244
I mean, I enjoy
boning your wife,

01:37:49.328 --> 01:37:51.288
but, uh, well,
let's face it.

01:37:51.413 --> 01:37:55.667
We both like it better
the other way, yes?

01:37:55.793 --> 01:37:57.795
So why don't we just
trade back.

01:37:57.920 --> 01:38:00.255
You can't give back
what you've taken from me.

01:38:02.132 --> 01:38:06.428
Oh, well.
Plan "B."

01:38:06.553 --> 01:38:08.597
Let's just kill each other.

01:40:11.845 --> 01:40:15.432
Sir, why are you
so upset?

01:40:15.557 --> 01:40:18.018
It's just Pollux Troy.

01:40:46.672 --> 01:40:50.551
Sir, look. You're
on the cover of Time.

01:40:50.676 --> 01:40:52.803
Listen. "In a single week,
Agent Sean Archer...

01:40:52.886 --> 01:40:55.097
"has ordered a stunning series
of blitzkrieg-style raids...

01:40:55.180 --> 01:40:58.851
"on the hideouts, staging grounds and
safe houses of our nation's assassins.

01:40:58.976 --> 01:41:00.978
Car bombs..."

01:41:04.731 --> 01:41:08.485
Sean. Look we're friends,
so I'm gonna tell you face to face.

01:41:08.569 --> 01:41:11.321
I don't give a damn if you are
Time's Man of the Year.

01:41:11.446 --> 01:41:15.742
After last night's bloodbath,
I'm terminatin' your war on terrorists.

01:41:20.539 --> 01:41:25.502
Is that, uh, because I'm getting
all the kudos and you're not?

01:41:25.586 --> 01:41:28.172
Jesus Christ. I don't know where
you're gettin' your intelligence.

01:41:28.297 --> 01:41:32.426
It's not from field agents.
Sometimes I think you know too much.

01:41:32.551 --> 01:41:34.595
Washington's
starting to worry.

01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:39.016
Justice wants a hearing.
Shoot.

01:41:39.099 --> 01:41:42.102
They're concerned
about the constitutionality
of your gestapo tactics!

01:41:42.227 --> 01:41:44.605
And frankly,
so am I! I'm...

01:41:47.024 --> 01:41:49.067
Uh, okay, Victor,

01:41:49.193 --> 01:41:53.030
I'll give the, uh,
taxpayers a break.

01:41:53.155 --> 01:41:55.115
But, um,

01:41:57.409 --> 01:42:00.704
I have something, uh,
I want to confess.

01:42:00.829 --> 01:42:03.999
And I don't think
you're gonna like it.

01:42:04.082 --> 01:42:06.502
I am Castor Troy.

01:42:17.404 --> 01:42:20.407
- Kimmy. Kim?
- Yes, sir.

01:42:20.491 --> 01:42:23.827
Call the paramedics. Victor
Lazarro's had a heart attack.

01:42:23.953 --> 01:42:26.121
- Oh, God. Right away.
- Thank you.

01:42:51.981 --> 01:42:53.899
Home.

01:43:17.423 --> 01:43:19.341
Eve.

01:43:21.760 --> 01:43:23.596
Eve.

01:43:23.679 --> 01:43:26.348
No. Honey, please,
please don't scream.

01:43:26.432 --> 01:43:28.350
Don't scream.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:43:28.434 --> 01:43:31.061
Okay, just don't,
don't, don't, don't.

01:43:31.145 --> 01:43:33.272
Just don't...
don't look at my face.

01:43:33.397 --> 01:43:36.567
And the voice.
Don't listen.

01:43:36.650 --> 01:43:39.862
- Just...
- I know who you are!
You killed our son!

01:43:39.987 --> 01:43:42.615
I did not kill our son.

01:43:42.740 --> 01:43:44.617
I'm Sean.

01:43:49.747 --> 01:43:52.583
The last time I saw you...

01:43:52.666 --> 01:43:54.668
was in this room.

01:43:54.793 --> 01:43:58.422
We had a fight when I said
I had to go away again.

01:43:58.505 --> 01:44:01.592
And I spent the night
in Mike's old bed.

01:44:14.772 --> 01:44:17.358
I'm tired, Eve.

01:44:17.483 --> 01:44:22.071
The assignment was to enter
a federal prison as Castor Troy.

01:44:22.196 --> 01:44:25.157
It's just fucking insane.

01:44:25.241 --> 01:44:29.328
And it's... A special ops
surgeon, uh, gave me, uh,

01:44:29.453 --> 01:44:31.455
Castor's face!

01:44:34.208 --> 01:44:37.878
Then, uh... And then, somehow,
Castor came out of his, uh,

01:44:39.672 --> 01:44:44.343
his-his coma, and
he killed everybody...

01:44:44.426 --> 01:44:46.679
who knew about the mission.

01:44:46.804 --> 01:44:50.558
But, but not before
transforming into me.

01:45:12.580 --> 01:45:16.417
I know you don't believe a word
I'm saying. Well, here's proof, Doctor.

01:45:16.542 --> 01:45:20.379
Your husband, me, my,
Sean's blood type is O-negative.

01:45:20.504 --> 01:45:23.215
Castor's is AB.

01:45:32.516 --> 01:45:35.144
And I love you.

01:45:49.116 --> 01:45:51.035
Get some backup.

01:45:55.664 --> 01:45:58.209
What a day.

01:46:01.587 --> 01:46:04.381
You look tense.

01:46:08.761 --> 01:46:13.098
I know I've been acting
different lately. Strange.

01:46:14.600 --> 01:46:18.312
I've got a confession
to make, Eve.

01:46:18.437 --> 01:46:21.440
You're not gonna like it.

01:46:21.524 --> 01:46:24.985
Oh, Eve. I feel...
I feel so close to you.

01:46:26.487 --> 01:46:29.907
I read your diary. I know
I shouldn't have. I'm ashamed.

01:46:29.990 --> 01:46:32.076
But I did.

01:46:32.159 --> 01:46:34.787
I just wanna be the man
that you deserve...

01:46:34.912 --> 01:46:37.498
passionate, tender.

01:46:41.627 --> 01:46:45.381
Victor Lazarro died today.
He had a heart seizure.

01:46:45.506 --> 01:46:48.342
My mentor, gone.

01:46:49.718 --> 01:46:52.179
First Tito, then Victor.
So what?

01:46:54.932 --> 01:46:57.726
I hope this doesn't mean
I'm losing you.

01:46:57.852 --> 01:46:59.728
Of course not.

01:47:07.653 --> 01:47:10.281
You're the only family
I've got.

01:48:00.623 --> 01:48:02.541
Oh, God.

01:48:06.587 --> 01:48:11.175
- Oh, God.
- I was hoping you'd come here.

01:48:11.258 --> 01:48:14.011
Thank you for trusting me.

01:48:16.597 --> 01:48:21.852
Right now,
I don't trust anyone.

01:48:21.936 --> 01:48:25.022
Eve, wh-where'd
you get that gun?

01:48:25.105 --> 01:48:27.316
I took it
from my fake husband.

01:48:27.441 --> 01:48:30.694
Put it down.
You know I'm Sean.

01:48:30.778 --> 01:48:34.448
Do I? Maybe Sean's
already dead, huh?

01:48:34.573 --> 01:48:37.493
I'm moving very slowly.

01:49:00.516 --> 01:49:04.019
I was thinking
the other day, I...

01:49:04.144 --> 01:49:06.021
I remember...

01:49:06.146 --> 01:49:09.275
I once took a date out...

01:49:09.400 --> 01:49:11.485
for surf and turf,

01:49:11.610 --> 01:49:15.573
not knowing she was
a vegetarian.

01:49:15.656 --> 01:49:20.202
So she ate bread.

01:49:20.327 --> 01:49:23.539
And, uh, and broke her tooth
on a rye seed.

01:49:27.126 --> 01:49:30.462
And we, we drove around
all night,

01:49:30.588 --> 01:49:34.592
uh, looking for a...
for a all-night dentist.

01:49:34.675 --> 01:49:38.220
And, and he, uh...
He was so drunk,

01:49:38.345 --> 01:49:40.890
he fixed the wrong tooth.

01:49:46.854 --> 01:49:50.482
And it... When I
finally brought her home...

01:49:53.694 --> 01:49:59.074
Even though it must have
hurt like hell,

01:49:59.200 --> 01:50:02.786
you, you, you kissed me.

01:50:14.590 --> 01:50:18.260
Sean,

01:50:18.385 --> 01:50:22.223
that man...

01:50:22.348 --> 01:50:25.643
You know we've been living
together as man and wife for a week.

01:50:25.726 --> 01:50:28.562
Yeah, I...

01:50:28.687 --> 01:50:33.317
I know.
Eve. Eve.

01:50:33.400 --> 01:50:36.362
I put you
in that position and, and...

01:50:36.445 --> 01:50:39.198
l-l-I can never
make it up to you.

01:50:46.080 --> 01:50:48.749
Well, you're damn well
gonna try.

01:50:48.874 --> 01:50:51.710
Let me take a look at that wound
before you bleed to death.

01:50:59.301 --> 01:51:01.554
With Lazarro out of the way,

01:51:01.679 --> 01:51:04.723
Castor's the new acting director
of the Bureau.

01:51:04.807 --> 01:51:08.060
- He's untouchable.
- Not tomorrow.

01:51:08.185 --> 01:51:10.354
Tomorrow he'll
be at Victor's service.

01:51:10.437 --> 01:51:14.066
Tomorrow.

01:51:14.149 --> 01:51:16.569
That will be the day.

01:51:20.239 --> 01:51:22.825
I want you and Jamie away from
there. Give him a good excuse.

01:51:22.908 --> 01:51:24.827
I can cover for Jamie,

01:51:24.952 --> 01:51:27.079
but if I'm not coming he's
gonna know that something's up.

01:51:28.956 --> 01:51:31.709
And besides, I'm the only one
who can try and explain the truth.

01:51:33.627 --> 01:51:36.672
Excuse me, Mr Archer.
May I help you?

01:51:36.755 --> 01:51:38.924
Dr Levine to X Ray.

01:51:50.895 --> 01:51:53.480
Sean, what are you
doing here?

01:51:58.903 --> 01:52:01.655
Sorry, darling, it...

01:52:01.780 --> 01:52:05.242
I just get so,
so jealous, I...

01:52:05.326 --> 01:52:08.037
I mean, wh-wh-what is a guy
to think when his, uh,

01:52:08.120 --> 01:52:10.039
his wife runs off
in the middle of the night?

01:52:10.122 --> 01:52:13.375
That I'm a doctor that's on call,
so please let me get back to work, okay?

01:52:13.459 --> 01:52:15.377
Sorry.

01:52:18.797 --> 01:52:22.968
Lies, distrust,
mixed messages.

01:52:23.093 --> 01:52:25.012
This is turning
into a real marriage.

01:52:45.658 --> 01:52:49.537
How's Adam?

01:52:49.662 --> 01:52:52.998
I took him over to my cousin's
until this whole thing blows over.

01:52:53.123 --> 01:52:55.626
- Where's Jamie?
- That's what I'd like to know.

01:52:55.709 --> 01:52:58.504
She stole $50 from my purse
and took off.

01:53:00.798 --> 01:53:04.969
- So what's the next move?
- This isn't your fight.

01:53:05.094 --> 01:53:08.639
Oh, come on. You're surprised?
Our daughter won't even
visit Michael's grave.

01:53:08.722 --> 01:53:11.183
You think she gives a damn
about your boss?

01:53:16.856 --> 01:53:20.985
He killed my brother. I'm not
gonna let him take you too.

01:53:35.708 --> 01:53:40.504
Whatever happens,
I promise...

01:53:40.588 --> 01:53:43.299
Sean Archer is
off your back for good.

01:53:57.021 --> 01:54:00.941
My dear friends, we are here
to celebrate the life of Victor Lazarro.

01:55:32.700 --> 01:55:35.286
Somebody back there asked me
to give this to you.

01:55:57.516 --> 01:56:00.144
In peace now, let us take
our brother Victor...

01:56:00.269 --> 01:56:02.354
to his place of rest.

01:56:49.026 --> 01:56:51.070
Isn't this religious?

01:56:54.240 --> 01:56:58.911
Ah, yes. The eternal battle
between good and evil,

01:56:59.036 --> 01:57:00.913
saint and sinner.

01:57:01.038 --> 01:57:03.499
But you're still
not having any fun!

01:57:13.092 --> 01:57:15.135
Honey? Honey?

01:57:17.680 --> 01:57:19.807
Come here.

01:57:22.893 --> 01:57:27.064
And guess what.
Your daughter's on the way.

01:57:27.147 --> 01:57:29.650
History repeats itself.

01:57:35.614 --> 01:57:39.243
This is between us.
Leave them out of it.

01:57:39.368 --> 01:57:43.998
No, you should've
left them out of it.

01:57:44.123 --> 01:57:47.626
Your son was an accident.
I wanted to kill you.

01:57:50.421 --> 01:57:53.549
But you took it
so personally.

01:57:53.632 --> 01:57:57.219
Why didn't you just
kill yourself or let it go?

01:57:57.303 --> 01:58:00.389
- No father could.
- No brother could either.

01:58:00.472 --> 01:58:03.475
Neither could a sister.

01:58:03.601 --> 01:58:05.603
Hey, baby.

01:58:08.981 --> 01:58:11.942
Sasha, what the fuck
are you doing here?

01:58:12.067 --> 01:58:14.069
Gee, Archer, I guess
I'm crashing.

01:58:14.153 --> 01:58:18.741
- You okay, baby?
- Yeah. Thanks.

01:58:18.824 --> 01:58:20.951
Sasha, baby.

01:58:21.076 --> 01:58:23.704
I'm Castor.
That's Archer.

01:58:23.829 --> 01:58:26.749
And I'm bored.

01:58:26.832 --> 01:58:30.544
- Put the fucking gun down.
- Why don't you put your guns down?

01:58:37.510 --> 01:58:39.929
What a predicament!

01:59:38.153 --> 01:59:40.489
Take care of our boy.

01:59:41.740 --> 01:59:44.201
You love him so much.

01:59:44.326 --> 01:59:47.663
Don't let him grow up
to be like us, promise?

01:59:49.915 --> 01:59:51.876
- Yeah.
- Say yeah.

02:00:21.488 --> 02:00:23.073
Mom?

02:00:42.092 --> 02:00:43.886
Jamie!

02:00:49.266 --> 02:00:52.019
Jamie, don't!

02:00:58.859 --> 02:01:01.195
Hello, Wanda?
Wanda, this is Eve Archer.

02:01:08.494 --> 02:01:10.246
I have something
crazy to tell you.

02:01:22.758 --> 02:01:26.387
It's a capital crime to try to kill
the next big boss of the FBI, yes?

02:01:26.470 --> 02:01:28.556
- Yes.
- Ah, yes.

02:01:28.639 --> 02:01:30.766
- The penalty...
- What?

02:01:30.891 --> 02:01:32.935
The penalty is death!

02:01:44.238 --> 02:01:46.448
Die. Please, God, die.

02:01:46.532 --> 02:01:48.909
Hold it!

02:01:48.993 --> 02:01:51.203
Good girl, Jamie!
Shoot him!

02:01:51.328 --> 02:01:54.874
Honey, don't listen to him,
honey! He's not your father!
Hear my voice. I'm your father!

02:01:56.375 --> 02:01:58.127
Use your eyes, Jamie.
Shoot him!

02:01:58.252 --> 02:01:59.962
Don't listen to him!
Don't shoot! Just, just...

02:02:00.087 --> 02:02:04.008
This scumbag... This scumbag shot
your brother, Jamie! Kill him!

02:02:07.178 --> 02:02:09.346
Clod.

02:02:09.471 --> 02:02:13.475
No daughter of mine
would shoot so wide.

02:02:13.559 --> 02:02:17.605
Dad, put the gun down.
Put it down.

02:02:19.315 --> 02:02:21.859
Dad, put it down.

02:02:21.984 --> 02:02:26.363
Now we're gonna find out
what's in Papa's bag. Peaches.

02:02:31.577 --> 02:02:33.662
Say goodbye to Papa.

02:02:35.915 --> 02:02:37.583
Jamie!

02:02:44.548 --> 02:02:48.511
Jamie! Jamie! Jamie,
are you all right? Oh, my God.

02:02:49.720 --> 02:02:51.472
Sir, are you okay?

02:03:00.856 --> 02:03:03.984
Please, someone please tell me
what planet I'm on?

02:03:18.958 --> 02:03:21.085
Get down!

02:04:35.201 --> 02:04:36.827
Stop! This is the police!

02:04:36.952 --> 02:04:40.206
Stop immediately or we'll
be forced to open fire!

02:04:41.207 --> 02:04:43.709
Fire! Fire!

02:09:11.227 --> 02:09:14.647
You're right, Sean.
I've misbehaved.

02:09:14.730 --> 02:09:16.482
I need to be punished.

02:09:21.862 --> 02:09:24.448
But remember,
every time...

02:09:24.573 --> 02:09:27.993
you look in the mirror,
you'll see my face.

02:09:45.094 --> 02:09:47.388
Die!

02:10:05.739 --> 02:10:08.450
Ready

02:10:08.576 --> 02:10:12.162
Ready for the big ride

02:10:12.288 --> 02:10:14.915
Baby

02:10:19.169 --> 02:10:21.755
Off of Pico in the middle
of the street.

02:10:29.180 --> 02:10:31.223
You okay, Archer?

02:10:35.436 --> 02:10:38.731
- What did you call me?
- He called you Archer, sir.

02:10:52.828 --> 02:10:58.000
Sean, they're bringing in
their top surgical team from DC.
You're going to be okay.

02:11:45.047 --> 02:11:47.716
When you wake up,
everything will be restored...

02:11:47.842 --> 02:11:50.511
just the way it was.

02:11:52.221 --> 02:11:57.601
My scar.
The one near my heart.

02:11:57.726 --> 02:12:00.521
This old bullet wound.

02:12:00.646 --> 02:12:03.065
- I won't need it any more.
- Okay.

02:13:01.373 --> 02:13:04.543
Dad?

02:13:16.597 --> 02:13:19.308
Dad?

02:13:19.433 --> 02:13:22.895
I'm sorry I shot you.

02:13:31.153 --> 02:13:34.573
I've got something
I have to ask both of you.

02:13:45.251 --> 02:13:47.962
This is, um, Adam.

02:13:48.087 --> 02:13:52.132
And he needs
a place to live.

02:13:52.258 --> 02:13:57.054
Hi. My name's Jamie.

02:13:57.179 --> 02:14:00.975
I'm Adam.

02:14:01.058 --> 02:14:03.435
Why don't you show Adam
his new room?

02:14:03.519 --> 02:14:06.772
Come on.

02:14:06.856 --> 02:14:08.774
Okay.
