00:00.159 --> 00:03.271
The police are back and they want to
talk to you both about Sophia Morton.

00:03.306 --> 00:04.466
Do you know Emily?

00:04.501 --> 00:05.699
No.

00:05.734 --> 00:08.248
We heard you three were quite chummy.

00:08.283 --> 00:09.388
I met her once.

00:09.423 --> 00:13.007
- Do you know someone gave her drugs the night she died?
- Ain't got nothin' on us.

00:13.042 --> 00:15.019
It was me who sold her the MDMA.

00:15.054 --> 00:16.962
You've been checking up on me?

00:16.997 --> 00:18.050
Was it you she killed herself for?

00:18.085 --> 00:19.382
She stalked me.

00:21.552 --> 00:24.146
- She went through my rubbish.
- We started again before.

00:24.181 --> 00:25.157
Will you do it now?

00:25.192 --> 00:26.705
I don't think so.

00:26.740 --> 00:28.175
I've lost the gym.

00:28.747 --> 00:31.607
- You're unemployed?
- Yeah, love. I'm bankrupt.

00:31.642 --> 00:34.467
It's you I spent all summer thinking about.

00:43.310 --> 00:45.039
Who fucking wants one now?

01:42.189 --> 01:43.887
James Cook.

01:51.321 --> 01:53.596
Your brief wants to meet you.

01:53.631 --> 01:54.626
He any good?

01:55.645 --> 01:57.476
Plead guilty. Right?

02:09.294 --> 02:11.019
Right?

02:11.054 --> 02:14.000
You wouldn't feed this to a pig.

02:14.035 --> 02:15.964
Not even a pig you hated.

02:15.999 --> 02:17.914
Life is this.

02:19.259 --> 02:20.500
This.

02:22.705 --> 02:29.207
You get born, eat some
processed crap, then you die.

02:29.242 --> 02:32.609
Right. And you're gonna get me
off somewhere in-between, yeah?

02:32.644 --> 02:34.113
Sit down.

02:37.576 --> 02:40.416
I'm your legal aid brief and, er,

02:40.451 --> 02:44.342
I'll make sure you... Face the right way,

02:44.377 --> 02:47.131
say yes or no in the right order...

02:47.166 --> 02:50.306
And probably waste too much of
everybody's bloody time, basically.

02:52.465 --> 02:54.969
GBH... affray...

02:55.004 --> 03:00.032
Punched the fuck out
of... Shanky Jenkinson.

03:00.067 --> 03:02.005
Do you know him? Do you know Shanky?

03:02.040 --> 03:03.251
No.

03:03.286 --> 03:05.538
Any particular reason?

03:05.573 --> 03:07.273
I was provoked...

03:07.308 --> 03:09.184
By Shanky?

03:09.219 --> 03:11.024
By who?

03:11.059 --> 03:12.367
Who? Who provoked you?

03:14.300 --> 03:15.483
No?

03:20.707 --> 03:22.613
It's your first offence.

03:22.648 --> 03:25.845
Plead guilty and, by the
miracle of British justice,

03:25.880 --> 03:28.356
you'll get a bullshit
Community Service Order.

03:28.391 --> 03:29.360
Not guilty.

03:33.479 --> 03:37.916
James, you did punch the
fuck out of, er, Shanky

03:37.951 --> 03:42.690
in front of... 83 witnesses.

03:49.384 --> 03:50.888
Not guilty.

03:50.923 --> 03:52.356
Pardon?

03:52.391 --> 03:55.827
Sorry. I thought you
said "not guilty" there.

03:58.058 --> 03:59.972
Yeah... Yeah, he is,

04:00.007 --> 04:02.687
pleading not guilty.

04:04.954 --> 04:06.717
Really?

04:06.752 --> 04:08.413
Really.

04:08.448 --> 04:10.075
Right.

04:12.224 --> 04:16.535
Right. Well, trial for the
15th of this month at 10am.

04:16.570 --> 04:20.846
Remanded on bail with an
electronic tagging order.

04:20.880 --> 04:21.615
And Duncan...

04:21.649 --> 04:22.701
Yeah.

04:22.736 --> 04:29.266
Really looking forward to
hearing you defend this one.

04:30.946 --> 04:32.516
Yeah, it's too tight, man.

04:32.551 --> 04:33.959
Good.

04:33.994 --> 04:35.461
Just checking.

04:35.496 --> 04:38.361
Every day, between the
hours of 7pm and 7am,

04:38.396 --> 04:41.081
you've got to be in your
house. Right? Or it goes off.

04:41.116 --> 04:42.243
I haven't got a house.

04:42.278 --> 04:46.009
It says here you'll be
staying with a Miss Ruth Byatt.

04:46.044 --> 04:47.016
What?!

04:47.051 --> 04:49.313
I ain't staying with her. No way!

04:49.348 --> 04:54.166
Yes, you are. Otherwise,
bleep, bleep, we'll arrest you,

04:54.701 --> 04:57.625
bang you up, and probably bang you
about a bit while we're doing it.

04:57.754 --> 04:59.209
He's joking.

05:10.955 --> 05:13.446
And he said, "Is that what
you call a broom handle?"

05:15.117 --> 05:16.684
Miss Byatt?

05:18.576 --> 05:20.271
Mum.

05:21.735 --> 05:24.389
Hello, Jimmy. How you been?

05:24.424 --> 05:27.044
Nobody calls me Jimmy now, Mum.

05:28.370 --> 05:30.292
Hello... Smelly.

06:02.401 --> 06:04.057
He's dying to see you.

06:11.021 --> 06:13.229
Go on. Go on!

06:13.264 --> 06:15.178
Right!

06:15.213 --> 06:17.050
I'm home!

06:18.538 --> 06:20.620
Where's my little sex monkey?

06:46.010 --> 06:47.694
Wet willy!

06:49.509 --> 06:52.319
Cook!

06:57.550 --> 06:59.347
Nipple cripple!

07:07.100 --> 07:11.366
Mum says she forgives
you and you can come back.

07:11.401 --> 07:12.841
Yes.

07:14.256 --> 07:15.393
Yeah.

07:15.428 --> 07:18.418
And we got pizza to celebrate.

07:18.453 --> 07:22.366
Oh, yeah. That's great, innit, bruv?

07:22.401 --> 07:24.240
Pizza.

07:29.345 --> 07:30.976
Oh, fuck me, you monkey!

07:35.010 --> 07:36.261
Oh, fucking hell!

07:48.282 --> 07:51.491
Oh, fuck me!

08:03.536 --> 08:06.310
Fuck me, you monkey!

08:43.405 --> 08:45.749
Wasn't me.

09:02.494 --> 09:04.041
Fuck them.

09:05.856 --> 09:08.694
Oh, here he is. Come
and have some breakfast.

09:08.729 --> 09:12.324
Jimmy, this is Alex. He's
going to be doing a piece on me.

09:12.359 --> 09:15.125
Your mother is a genius.

09:15.160 --> 09:18.311
The greatest conceptual
artist since Duchamp.

09:18.346 --> 09:19.776
He's going to be doing me all week.

09:21.920 --> 09:22.957
Great.

09:22.992 --> 09:23.871
Jimmy's a criminal.

09:25.279 --> 09:26.540
But we're forgiving him.

09:26.575 --> 09:29.044
Ruth says you're her greatest creation.

09:29.079 --> 09:33.266
A walking conceptual
installation. That's cool, man.

09:34.398 --> 09:36.969
But all your work's mesmerising.

09:37.004 --> 09:38.650
I mean, look at this.

09:38.685 --> 09:42.733
Composition, confluence, concept, wow!

09:42.768 --> 09:45.987
- Mum, whose tits are those?
- Don't be silly! Can't you tell?

09:46.022 --> 09:48.763
It's tactile, you know?

09:48.798 --> 09:52.154
Yeah. You just want to touch them...

09:52.189 --> 09:54.050
You just want to come on them!

10:01.497 --> 10:03.439
Will you go to prison?

10:03.474 --> 10:04.600
I might.

10:05.671 --> 10:08.160
But if you say sorry,

10:08.195 --> 10:10.650
won't they let you go?

10:10.685 --> 10:12.085
I'm not sorry.

10:12.120 --> 10:13.080
Why not?

10:13.115 --> 10:14.462
Never say sorry, kid.

10:14.497 --> 10:15.547
Why?

10:15.582 --> 10:17.300
Cos you're not a pussy, are you?

10:17.335 --> 10:18.348
No.

10:18.383 --> 10:21.390
We don't play their game, do
we? We don't play anyone's game.

10:21.425 --> 10:25.407
- Except for Rock Band. We can play that.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, we can play that.

10:26.777 --> 10:27.503
Finished?

10:27.538 --> 10:28.584
Yeah.

10:33.107 --> 10:34.688
You're barmy!

10:36.761 --> 10:38.308
Cor, this is posh.

10:38.343 --> 10:39.737
It's rubbish!

10:39.772 --> 10:41.001
Who's giving you shit, then, dude?

10:41.036 --> 10:43.771
Him.

10:43.806 --> 10:46.506
Erm... him and him. No, not him, he's nice.

10:46.541 --> 10:48.831
Him, he kicked me in the balls twice.

10:50.470 --> 10:51.414
Lads!

10:58.117 --> 10:59.270
Right, in.

10:59.305 --> 11:00.751
But I want to hang out with you.

11:00.786 --> 11:02.528
In!

11:02.563 --> 11:04.270
I'm gonna be enjoying my freedom.

11:04.305 --> 11:05.758
Doing what?

11:05.793 --> 11:07.988
I'm going to have a white riot! Touch me.

11:16.959 --> 11:18.700
Oh, yes!

11:18.735 --> 11:22.341
Look, you cannot spin it.
You're not allowed to spin it.

11:27.409 --> 11:30.344
Anyway, it was two
against one, you wankers.

11:33.107 --> 11:36.508
Hey! Do you think we
should go cheer her up?

11:36.543 --> 11:38.027
How do you expect to do that, J?

11:38.062 --> 11:40.535
Her boyfriend's just cheated on her
with the hottest of the hot, mate.

11:40.570 --> 11:41.878
Yup.

11:41.913 --> 11:44.782
Andrea is maximo hot. I
think about her sometimes.

11:44.817 --> 11:48.412
When I'm in bed. When I'm cosy.

11:48.447 --> 11:49.823
Just before I go to sleep.

11:51.352 --> 11:52.329
Sorry.

11:52.364 --> 11:54.047
Ok, I'm back. Right.

12:02.193 --> 12:04.002
Y'all right, Panda Pops?

12:04.037 --> 12:05.398
Not really.

12:07.541 --> 12:11.188
You know, love's thoroughly
over-rated, Panda.

12:11.223 --> 12:14.977
I've never even had a girlfriend
and look how happy I am.

12:15.012 --> 12:17.687
In between minor psychological breakdowns.

12:17.722 --> 12:22.728
Sure, all the serotonin, endorphins
and sex, et cetera, feel good.

12:22.763 --> 12:27.483
But really, "love" is an illusion.

12:27.518 --> 12:29.700
It can't last.

12:29.735 --> 12:31.278
Nope.

12:32.813 --> 12:34.963
Nicely done.

13:05.730 --> 13:08.699
Well,
howdy-fucking-doody.

13:08.734 --> 13:09.666
Hi, Cook.

13:11.579 --> 13:15.879
I just swarmed by, really, to
see how deep everyone's rolling.

13:15.914 --> 13:17.588
See who's up for a pint and a poke?

13:17.623 --> 13:18.891
JJ? Panda?

13:18.926 --> 13:20.160
No, thanks.

13:20.195 --> 13:21.749
No?

13:21.784 --> 13:23.260
Why?

13:23.295 --> 13:25.559
Just don't want to.

13:31.241 --> 13:35.496
Naomi, what about you? Bring
your lady, make it a threesome.

13:37.319 --> 13:40.413
What's up with you two?

13:40.448 --> 13:41.456
Black guy?

13:43.700 --> 13:44.812
Anyone?

13:44.847 --> 13:46.348
Aren't you scared, Cooky?

13:46.383 --> 13:47.503
Of what?

13:47.538 --> 13:48.869
Of going to the blimmin' chokey!

13:51.637 --> 13:52.633
We'll come.

13:52.668 --> 13:54.204
Nah, you're all right.

13:55.599 --> 13:58.853
- What happened to you?
- You don't remember?

13:58.888 --> 14:00.651
No, remember what?

14:02.269 --> 14:03.713
Who fucked you?

14:05.895 --> 14:08.181
Ah. Finally. The famous Mr. Cook.

14:09.227 --> 14:11.100
Hi. Dave.

14:11.135 --> 14:16.072
Dave Blood. We have met before,
in fact, but take my card.

14:19.940 --> 14:22.420
We should powwow.

14:23.709 --> 14:27.025
I can see that this college
has failed you, Mr. Cook.

14:27.060 --> 14:31.531
And I am deeply sorry. But that
is ten years of willy-nilly policy

14:31.566 --> 14:33.717
and red tape nonsensery for you.

14:33.752 --> 14:38.542
So unfortunately, since you've
been implicated, as it were,

14:38.577 --> 14:42.739
by the law, you have been
automatically... expelled.

14:42.774 --> 14:44.104
Expunged.

14:44.139 --> 14:45.678
Excommunicated.

14:45.713 --> 14:48.716
And I'm going to have to
ask you to... scoot off.

14:48.751 --> 14:49.732
Or what?

14:49.767 --> 14:53.294
Well, or Jonathan here
will escort you with,

14:53.329 --> 14:55.185
er, you know,

14:55.220 --> 14:56.414
extreme prejudice.

14:56.415 --> 14:59.373
Dude...

14:59.408 --> 15:01.369
Jonathan can kiss my arse.

15:01.404 --> 15:04.476
Unless he's tired from
licking yours, that is.

15:04.511 --> 15:05.504
Jonathan?

15:05.539 --> 15:08.868
Yes, that is tremendously amusing.

15:08.903 --> 15:13.067
Nevertheless, you are
going to have to abrogate

15:13.102 --> 15:15.740
and egress from the premises.

15:18.834 --> 15:20.290
Don't touch me!

15:20.325 --> 15:21.376
This way.

15:21.411 --> 15:24.130
- Get your fucking hands off, pussy!
- Come on!

15:25.285 --> 15:27.697
What the fuck are you doing?!

15:28.508 --> 15:32.644
It's an incident, certainly.

15:32.679 --> 15:36.547
Reasonable force utilised in self-defence.

15:38.079 --> 15:40.218
Defence.

15:40.253 --> 15:45.407
Luckily, it's all over now and,
er, you can all go back to normal.

15:45.942 --> 15:47.495
Good morning.

15:50.394 --> 15:52.812
- Cook, are you all right?
- Fuck off, you!

16:59.519 --> 17:01.658
When did you get so
sorry for yourself, Cook?

17:03.540 --> 17:06.023
We can talk about her.

17:06.059 --> 17:09.028
That's why you're here, isn't it?

17:11.582 --> 17:13.242
We gave that girl Sophia drugs.

17:13.278 --> 17:15.194
I didn't give her nothing.

17:15.230 --> 17:16.598
And I had an affair with her as well.

17:17.634 --> 17:18.646
What?

17:19.768 --> 17:22.828
And now she's dead.

17:26.627 --> 17:29.778
That's why you're here. You feel bad.

17:31.771 --> 17:33.907
Fuck off!

17:33.942 --> 17:37.400
I just come round to see if you
wanted that non-lezza willy waggle.

17:37.435 --> 17:38.879
That's all.

17:38.914 --> 17:40.283
Yeah, right.

17:40.318 --> 17:42.707
Do you want to know how I feel?

17:43.614 --> 17:48.665
I feel fucking terrible. My
girlfriend won't look at me.

17:48.666 --> 17:50.165
I could cry every minute.

17:50.200 --> 17:54.614
I feel shit and all I can do is...

17:54.649 --> 17:55.909
feel it.

18:00.479 --> 18:01.605
Deal with it!

18:05.816 --> 18:07.761
Waggle me!

18:20.155 --> 18:21.340
Yes?

18:21.375 --> 18:24.219
Come to see how my case is going, Duncan.

18:24.254 --> 18:25.469
You haven't got a case.

18:25.504 --> 18:27.847
That's a matter of opinion, that is, mate.

18:27.882 --> 18:29.189
Matter of opinion.

18:35.852 --> 18:39.644
Well...

18:39.679 --> 18:43.194
In summary, you've got about
as much chance of getting off

18:43.229 --> 18:45.700
as I have of blagging a
shag with Angelina Jolie.

18:45.735 --> 18:48.651
Well, lose the moustache, then, probably.

18:52.922 --> 18:54.469
It's just not happening, kid.

18:56.927 --> 18:59.344
To use legal terminology,
you're guilty as fuck.

18:59.379 --> 19:01.762
Yeah, me mum says I
should get a proper lawyer.

19:03.642 --> 19:05.299
What?

19:05.334 --> 19:07.802
You don't care?

19:07.837 --> 19:10.604
No.

19:10.639 --> 19:14.097
I really, really don't.
You see, I get paid anyway.

19:14.132 --> 19:15.699
She's filthy rich, man.

19:15.734 --> 19:16.840
She's famous.

19:16.875 --> 19:17.943
Yeah?

19:18.078 --> 19:20.180
- Yeah.
- Lucky you.

19:20.215 --> 19:22.920
Look, Duncan, stuff's happened to me, man.

19:22.955 --> 19:25.981
You should know about this. You
should be out there telling them

19:26.016 --> 19:27.879
all the shit that's gone down in my life.

19:27.914 --> 19:30.166
Duncan, are you smoking a number?

19:32.620 --> 19:34.018
You got a problem?

19:34.053 --> 19:36.126
Yeah, problem! You're
taking the fucking piss!

19:36.161 --> 19:39.483
Doesn't anyone owe me anything
here? Don't I get a hearing, no?!

19:39.518 --> 19:41.430
You put a kid in hospital.

19:41.465 --> 19:43.306
Remember?

19:43.341 --> 19:44.615
What's your excuse?

19:44.650 --> 19:46.724
People.

19:46.759 --> 19:48.906
People fucked me up, man.

19:48.941 --> 19:51.353
Well, go tell that to a judge.

19:51.388 --> 19:52.583
"Mummy fucked me up."

19:52.618 --> 19:54.410
Don't fucking speak about my mother!

19:54.445 --> 19:56.168
You don't talk about her, all right?

19:56.203 --> 19:57.192
I'm not.

19:58.589 --> 20:00.102
You are.

20:03.876 --> 20:07.949
Proper shit, aren't ya?
Proper fucking shit, aren't ya?

20:43.217 --> 20:44.912
What do you think?

20:44.947 --> 20:46.045
Is it true?

20:46.080 --> 20:48.719
Jimmy, art is always true.

20:51.666 --> 20:54.742
Why did you leave my dad?

20:54.777 --> 20:57.818
Because he was a twat.

20:57.853 --> 20:58.853
Agreed?

20:58.888 --> 21:00.992
He was entertaining.

21:01.027 --> 21:02.199
Good in bed.

21:02.234 --> 21:04.677
Didn't give a flying fuck
for anyone or anything.

21:04.712 --> 21:07.120
Ultimately it just gets
on your tits. Bit boring.

21:12.001 --> 21:13.684
Is that why you threw me out?

21:15.494 --> 21:18.884
You sold my wedding rings to buy dope.

21:18.919 --> 21:21.933
You wanted me to throw you out.

21:21.968 --> 21:23.391
Didn't you?

21:25.547 --> 21:28.994
But hey, that's over.

21:28.995 --> 21:30.963
You've come to see my work.

21:30.998 --> 21:32.956
I love that.

21:32.991 --> 21:35.304
And look. I'm hot!

21:35.339 --> 21:37.692
Aren't you proud of what I've done?

21:37.727 --> 21:41.288
Oh, my God! Ruth! This
is... I am totally engaged!

21:41.323 --> 21:43.375
Come and see the masterpiece.

21:43.410 --> 21:46.902
It's going to make Damien Hirst want
to cut his cock off and pickle it.

21:51.004 --> 21:53.276
- Lights, darling.
- What?

22:01.251 --> 22:04.687
I want to strip naked, it's so good.

22:04.722 --> 22:07.565
Yes, it is. Thank you.

22:07.566 --> 22:08.874
It's real, you know.

22:08.909 --> 22:11.652
So, so real.

22:13.320 --> 22:16.164
What do you reckon, kidder?
Has the girl done good?

22:23.840 --> 22:25.453
You little shit!!

22:25.488 --> 22:26.946
- You did that on purpose.
- No!

22:26.981 --> 22:30.064
You smart bastard! Don't
think I don't know! Get out!

22:30.099 --> 22:31.163
Go on, get out!

23:03.134 --> 23:05.182
Yeah, is Shanky in, please?

23:06.875 --> 23:08.240
Shanky!

23:09.706 --> 23:10.980
Friend!

23:16.174 --> 23:18.647
Yeah, Shanky.

23:18.682 --> 23:21.120
You Shanky, yeah?

23:21.155 --> 23:23.933
Look...

23:23.968 --> 23:25.731
This is weird...

23:27.400 --> 23:32.633
Look, I didn't... I've come round
to say sorry, well, you know, like...

23:32.668 --> 23:36.501
It wasn't your fault, d'you know, like.

23:36.536 --> 23:40.753
See, they're going to send me
down, so if you could say anything,

23:40.788 --> 23:44.971
like, I dunno, how I come over
and said sorry. I am sorry, mate.

23:45.006 --> 23:47.209
You know?

23:47.244 --> 23:50.805
I hope they get you in the
showers and fuck you up the arse.

24:08.578 --> 24:11.149
Mate, listen. Thank Christ you're here.

24:11.184 --> 24:13.709
Your mum's on one, again.
I've just come round...

24:13.744 --> 24:15.049
Yeah? I want to talk to you.

24:15.084 --> 24:19.418
Well, look who it is. The man who's
just cost me ninety thousand quid.

24:19.453 --> 24:21.917
Hello, you sweet little turd.

24:21.952 --> 24:24.910
- Mum?
- That's right, still your mum.

24:24.945 --> 24:26.065
And... yep.

24:28.138 --> 24:29.122
Where's Paddy?

24:29.157 --> 24:31.812
Oh, he's gone to see that friend.

24:31.847 --> 24:34.468
What's his name... Never mind.

24:34.503 --> 24:36.211
Look who's here.

24:36.246 --> 24:39.249
Freddie! Freddie, Freddie.
Long time no see, Freddie!

24:39.284 --> 24:41.269
What do you want, man?

24:41.304 --> 24:42.334
I came to see if you're
all right, if that's ok.

24:42.369 --> 24:44.030
Yeah, I'm fine!

24:44.065 --> 24:45.828
Mm-hm. Tipsy-topsy!

24:45.863 --> 24:49.080
Well, I'm glad that someone
is. Cos we've got a...

24:49.115 --> 24:52.298
Hey, now we can have a
proper party, can't we?

24:58.274 --> 25:00.947
Come on, what's the matter with you?!

25:00.948 --> 25:02.105
Sitting on your fat arses.

25:14.070 --> 25:15.327
Mum!

25:15.362 --> 25:16.585
What's the fucking matter with you?!

25:16.620 --> 25:17.838
Come on!

25:19.977 --> 25:23.788
What's wrong with you?!
We're all fucking... adults...

25:36.625 --> 25:38.092
She hasn't changed, then.

25:42.395 --> 25:43.665
Your 15th birthday party.

25:43.700 --> 25:45.952
What?!

25:49.753 --> 25:51.835
Where was I?

25:51.870 --> 25:53.100
Drunk.

25:53.135 --> 25:56.684
You had six coconut daiquiris. And
anyway, I was last man standing,

25:56.719 --> 25:57.865
and I was still fucked off my head.

25:57.900 --> 25:59.015
So you fucked my mum?!

25:59.050 --> 26:00.127
It wasn't like that!

26:00.162 --> 26:02.050
Well, tell me, Fred.
What the fuck was it like?

26:02.085 --> 26:06.293
Hang on. No, don't answer that shit.

26:07.654 --> 26:09.210
It was just a blow job.

26:09.245 --> 26:11.668
Oh! What a relief, man! Thank goodness!

26:11.703 --> 26:13.038
I'll make it up to you.

26:13.073 --> 26:15.426
How are you going to do that, Freddie?

26:15.461 --> 26:18.385
I let you take the one fucking
girl I've ever loved, man.

26:20.035 --> 26:23.698
Is there anyone else I care about
that you want to slip one to, mate?

26:23.733 --> 26:24.881
I'm sorry.

26:26.685 --> 26:28.050
I'm sorry.

26:29.658 --> 26:31.250
It's fine.

26:35.136 --> 26:37.443
Sorted. Everything's cool.

26:37.478 --> 26:38.912
Effy loves me. How can I...

26:38.947 --> 26:40.711
Stop talking about it!

26:45.657 --> 26:47.705
You smashed JJ, Cook.

26:49.571 --> 26:51.323
I...

26:53.390 --> 26:54.903
I didn't.

26:57.995 --> 26:59.405
He loves you, Cook.

27:01.341 --> 27:03.684
Well, that's all.

27:17.761 --> 27:19.240
And I love you too.

27:20.829 --> 27:22.831
Whatever you're doing, you can stop.

27:25.535 --> 27:28.083
All you got to do is stop.

28:29.415 --> 28:33.055
And I don't want to see
you again. Understand?

28:33.090 --> 28:35.299
I thought he was with his friends.

28:35.334 --> 28:37.509
He was. Just not in a good way.

28:37.544 --> 28:40.078
You want to speak to him.

28:40.113 --> 28:42.613
I will. I'm going to.

28:42.648 --> 28:43.747
Don't you worry.

28:43.782 --> 28:44.778
Ok.

28:44.813 --> 28:47.839
If I hear about you again...

28:49.039 --> 28:50.700
Anyway.

28:52.815 --> 28:53.780
Good evening.

28:53.815 --> 28:54.745
Good evening.

28:58.396 --> 28:59.317
What did you do?

28:59.352 --> 29:01.493
Me and Paul drank six Red Bulls each,

29:01.528 --> 29:04.308
we farted in a lift, we swam in a fountain,

29:04.343 --> 29:08.188
stole bras from M&S and we
started a fire on College Green

29:08.223 --> 29:09.936
and all the filth showed up.

29:09.971 --> 29:11.800
Daft little boot, you are.
What d'you do that for?

29:11.835 --> 29:13.791
Cos I'm not a pussy.

29:16.799 --> 29:20.872
Every time I try and do
something for this family!

29:20.907 --> 29:23.260
Mum!

29:23.295 --> 29:25.753
See?!

29:25.788 --> 29:28.222
That's what you get! All right?!

29:29.660 --> 29:32.242
Everything's gone wrong
since you've come back.

29:32.277 --> 29:34.378
You're like an infection!

29:34.413 --> 29:39.198
Go on, that's right! You
all bugger off in the end.

29:39.233 --> 29:43.983
That's right, just go on!
Go on! Just bugger off!

30:06.643 --> 30:08.622
Keep it steady.

30:15.397 --> 30:17.255
Ah! Get off!

30:25.743 --> 30:30.134
Go on, mate! Go on, kid!

31:14.201 --> 31:17.113
Take it easy.

31:19.463 --> 31:25.743
I fucking love you,
Pads, you hear me, yeah?

31:25.778 --> 31:27.342
It's just you and me, mate.

31:28.951 --> 31:30.475
No-one else understands.

31:32.093 --> 31:36.518
Yeah. Fuck everybody! Fuck Mum!

31:36.553 --> 31:38.036
Fuck everybody!

31:38.071 --> 31:40.938
Everybody else is a fucking
tosser! A fucking tosser!

31:43.596 --> 31:46.150
A fucking tosser, I hate them!

32:12.786 --> 32:14.401
Ey up. Look out your window.

32:17.331 --> 32:19.526
Looking good.

32:44.940 --> 32:46.976
We didn't kill her, you know.

32:49.875 --> 32:52.275
She killed herself.

32:53.880 --> 32:55.302
It doesn't help, though.

32:57.602 --> 33:00.400
I still spend every day
feeling like I want to puke.

33:09.019 --> 33:11.988
How's Emily?

33:12.023 --> 33:13.430
Angry.

33:15.912 --> 33:18.642
So... lonely.

33:29.395 --> 33:31.841
It all means so much to you, doesn't it?

33:31.876 --> 33:35.387
- What?
- Life.

33:35.422 --> 33:40.314
You just live a bit harder
than everybody else does.

33:40.349 --> 33:42.782
You splash about.

33:42.817 --> 33:45.175
You wallow in it.

33:45.210 --> 33:46.893
Like you can't lose a moment.

33:49.047 --> 33:50.514
Yeah, I'm well hard.

34:17.554 --> 34:20.261
The thing is, Naomi, you splash about,

34:21.849 --> 34:23.396
other people get wet.

34:27.536 --> 34:30.471
I don't give a fuck or
anything, it's just...

34:32.083 --> 34:33.766
You get a bit...

34:33.802 --> 34:35.219
You know.

34:52.348 --> 34:55.920
Fuck's sake! I'm never going
to get to bone you, am I?

34:55.955 --> 34:58.458
No.

34:58.493 --> 35:00.931
I love someone.

35:00.966 --> 35:02.820
You and me both, girl.

35:05.518 --> 35:06.985
You and me both.

35:25.625 --> 35:27.399
Lot of people looking for you.

35:32.213 --> 35:33.873
Where's your brother?

35:33.908 --> 35:36.372
Friend's house. He's sleeping.

35:36.407 --> 35:38.794
- Got to give him back.
- I know.

35:38.829 --> 35:42.333
I'd, er, I'd probably get
another lawyer, if I were you.

35:44.561 --> 35:49.601
Cos, I'm pretty fucking
shit all round, you know.

35:49.636 --> 35:53.200
Yeah, you're shit.

35:53.235 --> 35:56.204
But you're my shit. Ok?

35:56.239 --> 35:58.639
I'm the only defence lawyer I
know with a 100% conviction rate.

35:58.674 --> 36:00.818
Oh, jeez.

36:03.172 --> 36:05.458
They're going to put you in jail, James.

36:09.442 --> 36:12.252
What's eating you? What
are you rebelling against?

36:12.287 --> 36:14.712
What've you got?

36:14.747 --> 36:18.137
There you go, you see. You're
too fucking smart for most people.

36:18.672 --> 36:21.614
They don't even know you're
quoting Marlon Brando. Do they?

36:21.649 --> 36:24.844
You're pretty sharp
yourself, for a shit lawyer.

36:24.879 --> 36:28.775
Well, it's easier, ain't it? Blaming
all your shit on everyone else.

36:28.810 --> 36:32.672
Well, come on, then, why don't you
tell me something you have done?

36:32.707 --> 36:37.237
That you did... all by
your shitty little self.

36:37.272 --> 36:41.768
Last year, I stole my
best friend's girlfriend

36:41.803 --> 36:44.115
just because I could.

36:44.150 --> 36:48.678
Then I fucked her mate, best mate,
multiple times, man, just because I could.

36:48.713 --> 36:52.330
It's chicken feed, James.

36:52.365 --> 36:54.548
What is this? Oprah?

36:54.583 --> 36:56.972
Tell me something fucking worthwhile!

36:57.007 --> 36:59.792
Come on, you dick!

37:02.143 --> 37:07.308
- Just wanted to fucking crack someone.
- Right.

37:09.011 --> 37:10.866
He just...

37:10.901 --> 37:12.722
Freddie, man.

37:16.396 --> 37:19.456
I couldn't stand the way that
she was fucking looking at him.

37:24.517 --> 37:27.668
And I was thinking, why does
everybody get to piss on me?

37:31.007 --> 37:35.171
Everybody always fucking pisses on me.

37:39.931 --> 37:41.569
My fucking mum.

37:44.551 --> 37:47.577
My dad is a fucking tosser.

37:49.232 --> 37:50.654
And no-one gives a shit!

37:53.794 --> 37:56.206
Everybody's just out
for them-fucking-selves!

37:56.241 --> 37:58.020
Ah, grow up.

37:58.055 --> 38:00.908
They won't give a shit. So fucking what?!

38:00.943 --> 38:03.659
So I fucking smashed
the shit out of that kid!

38:03.694 --> 38:07.937
I fucking kicked the shit out
of him and I fucking enjoyed it!

38:09.544 --> 38:11.239
I enjoyed it, ok?

38:11.274 --> 38:12.794
Ok.

38:14.479 --> 38:16.333
That's pretty good.

38:34.701 --> 38:36.974
- Duncan?
- Yeah, kid?

38:37.009 --> 38:40.289
There's something else.

38:40.324 --> 38:43.384
The kid was pestering me, man.

38:45.007 --> 38:47.908
She kept on asking me for MDMA.

38:47.943 --> 38:49.455
- Sophia?
- Yeah.

38:51.586 --> 38:54.340
Yeah. So eventually, you know, I just...

38:56.375 --> 39:00.245
I just gave her some just to
shut her up more than anything.

39:00.280 --> 39:04.165
Then, I didn't see her again
until she fell off the balcony.

39:09.892 --> 39:14.625
- Do you want a lawyer here, James?
- No. It's fine.

39:14.660 --> 39:18.232
- He knows what I'm telling you.
- And nobody else was involved?

39:21.440 --> 39:23.874
Nope, nobody but me.

40:07.607 --> 40:11.566
- Been up to much?
- Oh, you know.

40:11.601 --> 40:13.626
I bet it's all action.

40:13.661 --> 40:15.264
Ballroom dancing in the morning,

40:15.299 --> 40:18.132
followed by a gin rummy tournament
and bumming in the showers.

40:18.167 --> 40:20.588
Yeah, I can barely sit.

40:22.198 --> 40:24.132
We're coming to your trial thing tomorrow.

40:24.167 --> 40:26.568
- We?
- Yeah. We.

40:28.160 --> 40:30.515
Freddie's worried sick.

40:30.550 --> 40:31.975
I bet he is.

40:33.731 --> 40:36.734
Probably scared I'm going to get
off and steal his woman again.

40:40.760 --> 40:44.764
I love him, Cook. That's
what I came to say.

40:51.923 --> 40:53.456
How is the love?

40:53.491 --> 40:57.222
It's a bit of a head fuck, to be honest.

40:57.257 --> 40:59.266
Not simple.

40:59.301 --> 41:01.656
I know you'd understand that.

41:01.691 --> 41:03.843
But I'm giving it a go.

41:06.459 --> 41:09.019
That's what I always loved about you, Cook.

41:09.054 --> 41:11.304
Brave.

41:21.600 --> 41:24.210
Eff?

41:24.245 --> 41:27.089
Would you tell JJ... you know.

41:47.478 --> 41:50.584
- You care.
- I don't.

41:50.619 --> 41:52.865
Yeah.

41:54.999 --> 41:57.854
Good job this isn't no win, no
fee, otherwise you'd be fucked.

42:12.793 --> 42:14.863
James Cook.

42:17.131 --> 42:21.888
Cook! Cook! No! Let go!

42:21.923 --> 42:23.680
- Cook!
- What are you doing here?

42:23.715 --> 42:27.515
- I bunked off school. I don't give a shit. I want to watch!
- Listen!

42:27.550 --> 42:29.453
Be a big man for me, ok?

42:29.488 --> 42:32.796
I need you to sit there for
us and wait. You can't come in.

42:32.831 --> 42:36.105
- Come and sit over here.
- Tell them to piss off!

42:36.140 --> 42:39.485
Tell them you didn't anything!

42:45.333 --> 42:48.222
And how do you plead?

42:48.257 --> 42:49.735
Guilty.

42:52.028 --> 42:56.374
Mr. Cook, you've wasted a lot of our time,

42:56.409 --> 43:00.318
and bail has been a disaster.

43:00.353 --> 43:02.926
Your mother says she's unable
to control your behaviour

43:02.961 --> 43:06.533
and she is unwilling to accept
you back into the family home.

43:06.568 --> 43:08.372
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

43:08.407 --> 43:11.695
So I'm afraid a custodial
sentence is inevitable.

43:11.730 --> 43:14.983
In any case, I'm told
there may be other charges.

43:15.018 --> 43:19.196
However, since you
wisely changed your plea,

43:19.231 --> 43:22.006
we're going to remand you
into custody for reports.

43:22.041 --> 43:24.782
You should expect to be
there for several months.

43:24.817 --> 43:27.821
And James, while you're there,

43:27.856 --> 43:31.990
I strongly advise you to behave yourself.

43:32.025 --> 43:35.927
Sentence set for two weeks
from today. Take him down.

43:38.941 --> 43:41.297
Cook! What's happening?

43:41.332 --> 43:46.019
What's happening, Cook?!
Tell them to piss off! Cook!

44:08.290 --> 44:11.733
It seems your father has
let us down once again.

44:11.768 --> 44:17.172
Because of his stupidity, this
house is being taken from us.

44:17.207 --> 44:18.935
Who the fuck do you think you are?

44:20.978 --> 44:24.129
I'm Katie fucking Fitch.
Who the fuck are you?

44:29.736 --> 44:31.500
Do you fancy me?

44:31.600 --> 44:33.700
- Just checking.
- Of course.
