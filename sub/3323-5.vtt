I wanna show you something.

29:08.748 --> 29:11.581
We got a little lucky here,
the video store didn't have any cameras,

29:11.792 --> 29:13.999
but a security camera
that was watching another parking lot

29:14.212 --> 29:15.497
happened to grab a few frames.

29:16.797 --> 29:18.378

29:46.160 --> 29:47.366
Can't say I have either.

29:49.080 --> 29:50.035
You've got a problem here.

29:51.249 --> 29:54.241
My first instinct was it was a bear,
but bears don't walk on two legs.

29:54.502 --> 29:56.959
No, they drop to all fours.

29:59.715 --> 30:01.501
Look, like I said,
you really need an expert here.

30:01.968 --> 30:05.335
Yeah, yeah, but...
Could this still be a mountain lion?

30:06.389 --> 30:08.254
I'm sorry. I've got a sick Doberman that

30:08.474 --> 30:09.884
needs my attention.

30:10.434 --> 30:13.517
- No other ideas?
- I'm sorry.

I could help you, but I've got a sick...

Yeah.Dog.

30:18.359 --> 30:19.815

weren't coming home

as "unusually driven."

he might ease up on himself a little.

32:08.260 --> 32:10.000
"It's the need to please, the overachieving,"

erratic behavior?

32:43.712 --> 32:45.998
I'm not the one who told her she had to
choose who she wants to live with,

32:46.215 --> 32:48.126
as if that wouldn't warp a 16-year-old girl.

32:48.509 --> 32:50.374

33:15.286 --> 33:17.117
I thought "Stiles" was his last name.

33:17.413 --> 33:18.528
His last name is "Stilinski."

33:19.165 --> 33:21.747
You named your kid "Stiles Stilinski"?

33:22.084 --> 33:24.951
No, that's just what he likes to be called.

Oh. Well, I like to be called "Cupcake."

I don't even know how to pronounce that.

what you mean by "home situation."
