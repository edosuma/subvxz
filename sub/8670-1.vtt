## [soft rock]

02:15.235 --> 02:16.167
[Woman]
Ouch.

02:16.236 --> 02:17.168
[Man]
Shit. Shit.

02:17.237 --> 02:19.398
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

02:19.472 --> 02:21.997
It's okay.
I have another one.

02:22.075 --> 02:23.440
All right.

02:26.813 --> 02:28.212
Slow down.

02:28.281 --> 02:30.511
Just follow me.

02:30.583 --> 02:31.982
[Man]
You like that?

02:32.051 --> 02:33.075
[Woman]
Uh-huh.

02:33.153 --> 02:35.713
Tell me you like it.

02:35.788 --> 02:38.154
I just did.

02:47.567 --> 02:49.091
Please don't tell me you're taking
lessons from that Neanderthal.

02:49.169 --> 02:51.228
No. No.

02:51.304 --> 02:53.772
Good.
I want us to be special.

02:53.840 --> 02:56.400
[man coughs]

02:56.476 --> 02:58.842
Ah-choo!

02:58.912 --> 03:00.209
[snorts]

03:04.350 --> 03:07.251
That's disgusting.

03:07.320 --> 03:09.185
Hey, let's explore.

03:18.798 --> 03:20.595
[woman laughs]

03:26.839 --> 03:29.501
Marco.

03:34.847 --> 03:35.871
[horns honking]

03:35.949 --> 03:37.246
Hey, what's the holdup?
This sucks.

03:37.317 --> 03:38.409
Why is there traffic?

03:38.484 --> 03:39.917
What is going on?
What is that?

03:39.986 --> 03:41.385
This is crazy.

03:41.454 --> 03:42.819
[radio]
A spokesman released a statement

03:42.889 --> 03:43.947
ten minutes ago

03:44.023 --> 03:47.789
saying that the quarantine exercise
will be for 24 hours...

03:47.860 --> 03:49.521
[military radio]
Charlie 1-4, this is Charlie...

03:49.596 --> 03:51.461
We have visual contact.

03:51.531 --> 03:54.022
We got reservations at 7.
You mean to tell me we can't get through?

03:54.100 --> 03:55.965
This is bullshit. Bullshit.

03:56.035 --> 03:58.094
You can't do this.
We're in America.

03:58.171 --> 04:00.071
Who gave the order
for this exercise?

04:00.139 --> 04:02.471
Sir, my orders are to keep
this road sealed off

04:02.542 --> 04:04.100
for the next 24 hours.

04:04.177 --> 04:06.475
You can take your son
to the hospital in town.

04:06.546 --> 04:08.776
Those guys don't know their asses
from a hole in the ground.

04:08.848 --> 04:10.076
I want to go to a real hospital.

04:10.149 --> 04:11.548
Sir, I understand.

04:11.618 --> 04:13.643
Not unless you have kids,
you don't fucking understand.

04:13.720 --> 04:16.086
Honey,
you're not helping.

04:16.154 --> 04:18.055
We're going to Boulder.

04:18.124 --> 04:21.389
Corporal Cross? Platoon up.

04:21.461 --> 04:24.328
You heard the man.
Let's go. Let's go.

04:24.397 --> 04:26.558
Sir, I'm asking you politely.

04:26.633 --> 04:29.431
Please turn
your car around. Please.

04:35.875 --> 04:37.968
Mrs. Leitner?
What?

04:38.044 --> 04:40.103
Sarah, what are you
doing here?

04:40.179 --> 04:41.942
Your mom told me
you were never coming back.

04:42.015 --> 04:44.711
Well, you know
how she exaggerates.

04:44.784 --> 04:46.843
Besides, I'm needed here.

04:46.919 --> 04:48.477
Look, I'm sorry
that I yelled,

04:48.554 --> 04:50.818
but can you
get us out of here?

04:50.890 --> 04:52.323
Cody is really sick.

04:52.392 --> 04:54.053
Mr. Leitner, I understand
that you're upset,

04:54.127 --> 04:56.652
but the best thing that
you can do for Cody right now

04:56.729 --> 04:57.923
is to get him
to the medical center.

04:57.997 --> 04:59.760
The Army's
brought in specialists.

04:59.832 --> 05:01.595
They're already there
at the hospital.

05:01.668 --> 05:03.761
That'll be much quicker
than driving to Boulder.

05:03.836 --> 05:06.202
She's right.

05:06.272 --> 05:07.466
[Sarah]
Thank you.

05:14.914 --> 05:17.314
All right, get the rest
of these cars turned around.

05:17.383 --> 05:18.577
[Man]
Okay, you heard the captain.

05:18.651 --> 05:20.414
Let's get all of the cars turned around.

05:20.486 --> 05:21.817
Excuse me, sir.

05:21.888 --> 05:23.913
Sir.

05:23.990 --> 05:26.424
Did I just
tell them the truth?

05:26.492 --> 05:29.757
Corporal, your orders are
to keep this shit hole town--

05:29.829 --> 05:32.855
Excuse me.
Your shit hole town sealed off.

05:32.932 --> 05:34.092
Now do it.

05:34.167 --> 05:35.566
Yes, sir.

05:35.635 --> 05:37.728
[radio]
0616, over.

05:37.804 --> 05:39.863
Yeah, where the hell
are those med 'chines?

05:39.939 --> 05:41.634
They were supposed to
be here three hours ago.

05:41.708 --> 05:42.936
They haven't reported in, sir.

05:43.009 --> 05:44.567
We've got teams searching now.

05:44.644 --> 05:46.544
No. Both of them?

05:56.789 --> 05:58.586
Nina?

05:58.658 --> 06:00.922
[mice squeaking]

06:19.245 --> 06:20.872
Nina?

06:22.548 --> 06:24.379
Hello.

06:28.054 --> 06:30.545
Gotcha!
Aah!

06:33.192 --> 06:34.750
I got you.

06:34.827 --> 06:37.125
Not really.
Yeah, right.

06:40.333 --> 06:42.028
What'd you find?

06:42.101 --> 06:44.797
I don't know.

06:44.871 --> 06:46.133
You want to check it out?

06:46.205 --> 06:49.038
Find a cool little spot?

06:49.108 --> 06:53.374
In a dark hole?
I don't think so.

06:54.414 --> 06:56.075
Hey, didn't you
say something

06:56.149 --> 06:58.947
about your mother
being sick with the flu?

06:59.018 --> 07:01.418
Yeah, she's in bed.

07:01.487 --> 07:04.388
You think she'd know
if we were on your couch?

07:05.558 --> 07:06.957
[claps]
Zip it up, Kyle.

07:07.026 --> 07:08.618
What?

07:08.694 --> 07:10.525
We're out of here.
Come on.

07:12.298 --> 07:13.390
I'm not really done here.

07:16.035 --> 07:18.663
You want a ride? You're done.

07:20.773 --> 07:23.003
Your friend's
a real buzz kill.

07:23.075 --> 07:24.838
Tell me about it.

07:28.514 --> 07:29.572
Oh, God.

07:32.418 --> 07:33.646
Jesus, you okay, man?

07:37.256 --> 07:39.019
Chill. It stopped.
Are you my mom?

07:39.091 --> 07:40.922
Okay, okay, come on. We gotta go.

07:40.993 --> 07:43.188
Nina and I have, you know, plans.

07:47.934 --> 07:50.232
My parents aren't getting home
for a couple of hours.

07:50.303 --> 07:51.531
Want to come over?

07:51.604 --> 07:53.697
Are you nuts?

07:53.773 --> 07:55.400
If you got me sick,
I'll kill you.

07:55.475 --> 07:56.407
No.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.273
Come on, Kyle!
Bus is leaving!

07:58.344 --> 07:59.436
Let's go!
Wait!

07:59.512 --> 08:01.377
This is KSWT,
broadcasting live

08:01.447 --> 08:03.881
from downtown
Leadville, Colorado.

08:03.950 --> 08:05.781
[Man]
So I have some travel news

08:05.852 --> 08:08.184
for all of you trying to get out of town.

08:08.254 --> 08:11.553
Route 40 will be closed
until 7:30 tomorrow night.

08:11.624 --> 08:15.958
Still, they keep saying
this is just an exercise.

08:16.028 --> 08:18.826
Now, Uncle Sam wouldn't be
trying to lie to us, would he?

08:18.898 --> 08:22.265
No. Stay tuned for further bulletins.

08:22.335 --> 08:25.896
In the meantime, when the man
gives them to me,

08:25.972 --> 08:27.837
I'll give them to you.

08:27.907 --> 08:31.673
And now, some more
inane bull stuff.

08:31.744 --> 08:35.770
So, as a cog in the military
industrial complex,

08:35.847 --> 08:37.315
are you capable of
independent thought?

08:37.383 --> 08:39.613
Sir, my orders are to relay
the information to you

08:39.684 --> 08:41.346
so you can pass it on
to the public.

08:41.419 --> 08:43.820
This ain't about
that flu thing, is it?

08:43.890 --> 08:45.687
So what the fuck
is it about?

08:48.628 --> 08:51.358
You are gonna talk to me,
so help me God.

08:51.430 --> 08:55.389
Or...Celine Dion.

08:56.402 --> 08:58.302
You probably like her.

08:58.371 --> 09:01.568
## [rock]

09:03.276 --> 09:04.641
Well, hey, come on.

09:04.710 --> 09:06.803
You know, it was
just my allergies.

09:06.879 --> 09:08.506
Look,
I'll give you money.

09:08.581 --> 09:09.605
What?

09:09.682 --> 09:11.547
Well--
Fuck you.

09:11.617 --> 09:13.278
I'm walking home.

09:21.594 --> 09:23.721
Where'd she go?

09:23.796 --> 09:26.128
She said she needed
some exercise.

09:28.467 --> 09:30.298
# Everything is all right #

09:30.369 --> 09:33.202
# Things can be
as they should #

09:33.272 --> 09:35.137
# If you look after me #

09:35.207 --> 09:38.142
# The way
I looked after you #

09:40.079 --> 09:42.377
We're so over, Kyle.

09:43.382 --> 09:45.282
[creaking]

09:45.351 --> 09:46.841
Kyle?

10:02.101 --> 10:05.002
[loud growl]

10:05.071 --> 10:06.766
Aah!

10:08.407 --> 10:11.103
[panting]

10:17.550 --> 10:18.915
Whoa!

10:23.289 --> 10:24.221
Aargh!

10:24.290 --> 10:28.124
Aah!

10:36.402 --> 10:37.391
[siren]

10:43.542 --> 10:45.407
Hey, Private,
why don't you be all you can be

10:45.478 --> 10:46.911
and grab them damn batteries?

10:52.151 --> 10:55.143
Can you believe they're
gonna give that bitch a gun?

10:59.125 --> 11:00.717
Get this to Captain Rhodes
as soon as you can.

11:00.793 --> 11:02.784
Corporal Cross.

11:02.862 --> 11:05.228
We were given orders
to report to your squad.

11:09.535 --> 11:11.435
Think I'm gonna like it here.

11:11.504 --> 11:13.665
You were at Fort Bragg, right?

11:13.739 --> 11:15.138
Yes.

11:15.207 --> 11:16.265
Yeah, I heard about you.

11:16.342 --> 11:18.173
You and my homie Henry Fat

11:18.244 --> 11:21.042
was hitting it for
a couple months, right?

11:21.113 --> 11:23.479
You and your homie
got your wires crossed.

11:23.549 --> 11:24.481
It didn't happen.

11:24.550 --> 11:25.812
If you say so.

11:25.885 --> 11:27.443
As of now, you two
are on guard duty.

11:27.520 --> 11:28.817
This is your barricade.

11:28.888 --> 11:31.220
No one gets through.
You got that?

11:31.290 --> 11:32.222
Crain, you the driver?

11:32.291 --> 11:33.758
Yes, sir. Um, God.

11:33.826 --> 11:34.758
Ma'am.

11:34.827 --> 11:36.692
You up for a road trip?

11:36.762 --> 11:37.751
Yeah.

11:39.298 --> 11:40.492
No one gets through.

11:44.336 --> 11:45.928
How long we supposed
to stay here?

11:46.005 --> 11:47.370
We'll try and be back
before breakfast.

11:47.440 --> 11:49.169
That's, like, 12 hours!

11:49.241 --> 11:51.266
We'll bring you a bagel.

11:51.343 --> 11:54.437
Ahem. Are we really
spending the night together?

11:54.513 --> 11:55.707
Not a chance.
Okay, good,

11:55.781 --> 11:58.545
because that wouldn't be appropriate.

11:58.617 --> 12:00.983
He was definitely
hitting that.

12:01.053 --> 12:02.611
Shut up.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.593
I-- I thought
you wanted me to drive.

12:10.663 --> 12:12.130
I know the way.

12:12.198 --> 12:13.756
You just join?

12:13.833 --> 12:15.664
Really? You can tell?

12:15.735 --> 12:17.464
Yeah, seven months ago.

12:17.536 --> 12:19.163
I was studying
radar and countermeasures.

12:19.238 --> 12:21.001
My first time being called out.

12:21.073 --> 12:23.439
Kind of wish it was something
a little more exciting.

12:23.509 --> 12:24.703
Be careful what you wish for.

12:24.777 --> 12:26.802
I've seen exciting.

12:26.879 --> 12:28.346
You don't have to worry.

12:28.414 --> 12:29.904
Nothing really happens
in this town anyway.

12:29.982 --> 12:32.644
Yeah, it seems
like a real shit hole.

12:33.886 --> 12:35.319
Where are we going anyway?

12:35.387 --> 12:37.048
My house.

12:38.090 --> 12:39.990
Oh, so you're from here?

12:40.059 --> 12:43.290
Born and raised.

12:43.362 --> 12:46.798
Well, it's kind of
a charming shit hole.

12:58.811 --> 13:01.609
All right, I'll be back.

13:01.680 --> 13:04.274
Listen,
Crain sounds so formal.

13:04.350 --> 13:06.284
What do your friends
call you?

13:06.352 --> 13:08.513
Um, my friends call me Bud.

13:08.587 --> 13:11.579
Bud. Okay.

13:11.657 --> 13:15.024
Well, when we're not around the others,
you can call me Sarah.

13:18.531 --> 13:20.055
[car door shuts]

13:25.504 --> 13:26.766
Whoo.

13:28.307 --> 13:30.172
## [rock]

13:37.483 --> 13:39.075
Nothing on TV?

13:40.286 --> 13:41.810
Sarah?

13:41.887 --> 13:43.445
Haven't you heard of knocking?

13:43.522 --> 13:44.921
Uh, this is
my house, too.

13:44.990 --> 13:47.959
You want privacy,
find a new place.

13:48.027 --> 13:50.393
What's going on, Nina?
Nothing, really.

13:50.462 --> 13:52.089
Your father still
teaching Sunday school?

13:52.164 --> 13:53.290
This is so not cool.

13:53.365 --> 13:54.423
You know what, you missed
a button right there.

13:54.500 --> 13:55.694
What the hell are
you doing here?

13:55.768 --> 13:56.894
Enforcing the quarantine.

13:56.969 --> 13:58.061
What's up with not
returning my calls?

13:58.137 --> 13:59.468
What quarantine?
What calls?

13:59.538 --> 14:00.664
You're kidding me.

14:00.739 --> 14:02.639
I called your cell phone,
like, five or six times.

14:02.708 --> 14:04.903
You know what?
Where's Mom?

14:04.977 --> 14:05.966
In bed, I guess.

14:06.045 --> 14:07.569
You guess.
I just got home.

14:07.646 --> 14:08.635
She wasn't feeling well
this morning.

14:08.714 --> 14:09.578
And you didn't
check on her?

14:09.648 --> 14:10.615
I check on her every day.

14:10.683 --> 14:11.615
That's a lot more
than some people.

14:11.684 --> 14:13.276
Get over it, Trevor.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.517
Hey, Mom.

14:20.025 --> 14:22.186
Sarah, honey.

14:22.261 --> 14:24.229
I didn't know you were coming.

14:24.296 --> 14:25.490
[cough]

14:25.564 --> 14:28.397
I guess you were too busy to call.

14:28.467 --> 14:29.661
How are you feeling, Mom?

14:29.735 --> 14:30.929
I'm okay.

14:31.003 --> 14:32.630
No, you're not.
You're burning up.

14:32.705 --> 14:34.673
Please, you have more
important things to do

14:34.740 --> 14:36.571
than worry about me.

14:36.642 --> 14:38.109
What are you doing here?

14:38.177 --> 14:39.439
I'm taking you
to the hospital.

14:39.511 --> 14:41.536
Don't be silly.

14:41.614 --> 14:44.139
It's just a cold.
I took some vitamins.

14:44.216 --> 14:46.207
Mom, I'm taking you
to the hospital, okay?

14:46.285 --> 14:47.513
Let's get you dressed.

14:47.586 --> 14:50.282
[panting]

14:50.356 --> 14:51.721
[coughing]

14:53.492 --> 14:56.188
My dad's left a dozen messages.
They're at the hospital.

14:56.262 --> 14:57.388
How long has Mom been sick?

14:57.463 --> 14:58.953
Since this morning.
It's a cold.

14:59.031 --> 15:00.658
Everyone's got it.
And when did you start caring?

15:00.733 --> 15:01.825
Don't start with me.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.027
Kyle had it really bad.

15:03.102 --> 15:04.467
His nose
was gushing blood.

15:04.536 --> 15:06.333
Where is he now?

15:06.405 --> 15:08.839
Home. He found his dad's
supply of medical hash.

15:08.908 --> 15:11.308
I'm gonna run over there
and check on him.

15:11.377 --> 15:12.571
Wait, wait.

15:12.645 --> 15:14.135
Wait, you can't even
go upstairs

15:14.213 --> 15:15.407
to check on your own mother,

15:15.481 --> 15:17.847
and now you want to go
all the way across town?

15:17.917 --> 15:20.715
No. You're gonna
go upstairs,

15:20.786 --> 15:22.879
make sure
Mom gets dressed,

15:22.955 --> 15:24.047
and don't leave
until I get back.

15:24.123 --> 15:25.852
Do you think
you can handle that?

15:25.925 --> 15:27.586
I'll go check on Kyle.

15:27.660 --> 15:30.424
Aye-aye, Admiral Bitch.

15:33.565 --> 15:34.497
Everything okay?

15:34.566 --> 15:36.193
No, it's not.

16:15.207 --> 16:16.765
[knocking]

16:18.477 --> 16:20.445
Kyle.

16:20.512 --> 16:23.106
Anybody here?

16:31.724 --> 16:33.658
Oh, shit.

16:33.726 --> 16:35.694
Don't worry. It's not loaded.

16:58.984 --> 17:01.282
Oh, my God.

17:25.077 --> 17:26.806
What the hell happened here?

17:30.249 --> 17:31.944
Aah! Fuck!

17:32.017 --> 17:34.611
Fuck! Uhh! Oh!

17:40.325 --> 17:41.758
What's there?

17:44.530 --> 17:45.462
The phone is dead.

17:45.531 --> 17:47.089
Fuck.

17:51.270 --> 17:52.760
Oh, God.

17:52.838 --> 17:54.271
[beeping]

17:54.339 --> 17:55.601
I don't have any service.

17:57.342 --> 17:58.866
Yeah.
Come on.

17:58.944 --> 18:00.002
Let's go.

18:01.046 --> 18:04.311
Fitzsimmons,
14 Cypress Pond Road.

18:04.383 --> 18:06.044
The boy Kyle is missing.

18:06.118 --> 18:07.915
The bodies look like they
were mauled by something.

18:07.986 --> 18:10.546
I couldn't call the police.
All the phones are dead. Over.

18:10.622 --> 18:11.816
[Rhodes]
Yes, I know, Corporal.

18:11.890 --> 18:13.414
We're blocking all phone lines

18:13.492 --> 18:15.722
until we get control
of the situation.

18:15.794 --> 18:18.558
Got a whole lot of wild
rumors running around here.

18:18.630 --> 18:20.825
I'll get that info to the police.

18:20.899 --> 18:22.025
Where are you?

18:22.101 --> 18:23.796
I need to take my mother
to the hospital, Sir.

18:23.869 --> 18:25.427
Well, I'm headed
over there right now

18:25.504 --> 18:27.028
to see if I can find
some missing doctors.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.801
You get back to
that roadblock ASAP.

18:28.874 --> 18:31.069
Yes, sir. Over and out.

18:34.646 --> 18:36.443
Why isn't your gun loaded?

18:37.716 --> 18:39.581
It's complicated.

18:42.488 --> 18:43.420
Cool.

18:43.489 --> 18:46.583
I'm a vegetarian, by the way.

18:46.658 --> 18:49.092
Maybe we should just
keep that between us.

19:05.777 --> 19:06.971
Was Kyle stoned?

19:08.180 --> 19:10.341
He wasn't there.

19:10.415 --> 19:12.280
Did his parents
know where he was?

19:12.351 --> 19:13.283
No.

19:13.352 --> 19:14.910
Oh, oh. I'm bleeding.

19:15.921 --> 19:17.786
There's gauze
in the kit.

19:17.856 --> 19:19.346
All right.
Here, here, I got it.

19:19.424 --> 19:20.356
Here,
tilt your head back.

19:20.425 --> 19:22.620
Careful.
You got it?

19:24.663 --> 19:26.927
So when are you
going back to Denver?

19:32.571 --> 19:34.436
[coughing]

19:34.506 --> 19:36.133
[siren]

19:36.208 --> 19:37.869
[Sarah]
Park it and meet us inside.

19:37.943 --> 19:39.274
[Bud]
Yes, Ma'am.

19:55.227 --> 19:57.422
[coughing]

20:02.701 --> 20:03.690
Slow down!

20:03.769 --> 20:05.259
Oh!

20:05.337 --> 20:07.362
Jerk!

20:07.439 --> 20:10.374
Excuse me, ma'am,
my mom needs a doctor.

20:10.442 --> 20:12.239
Yeah, her and everyone else.

20:12.311 --> 20:13.642
Look, here.

20:13.712 --> 20:16.340
Just write her name on the list,
and we'll get to her.

20:17.816 --> 20:18.874
I-I can't wait.

20:18.951 --> 20:20.851
Listen, lady,
half the town's sick.

20:20.919 --> 20:22.443
We're overwhelmed
and understaffed.

20:22.521 --> 20:24.614
Just write her name
down on the list.

20:25.791 --> 20:27.816
[coughing]

20:29.194 --> 20:31.822
Mom... look, they're
a bit overwhelmed, okay?

20:31.897 --> 20:33.330
We're going to have to wait.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.160
What?

20:37.236 --> 20:38.362
Do you mind?

20:42.441 --> 20:43.931
I found my mom and dad.

20:44.009 --> 20:45.374
They're in a room,
waiting for the doctor.

20:45.444 --> 20:47.036
You want to come with?
Yeah. I'll be right back.

20:47.112 --> 20:49.273
Trevor, wait!

20:52.351 --> 20:54.876
Stay here.

20:54.953 --> 20:57.683
Salazar, you're supposed
to be on guard duty.

20:57.756 --> 20:58.882
Williams and Elders
have it covered.

20:58.957 --> 21:00.117
Captain had me
come with him.

21:00.192 --> 21:01.682
You know the phone lines
are down.

21:01.760 --> 21:02.818
The cell phones
aren't even working.

21:02.894 --> 21:04.919
I heard it was orders
from Washington.

21:04.997 --> 21:06.396
[coughing]

21:06.465 --> 21:08.558
You think this is still
just an exercise?

21:08.634 --> 21:12.832
Nah. There's some real
serious shit going down.

21:12.904 --> 21:14.269
Corporal Cross.

21:21.280 --> 21:22.907
Sir.

21:24.616 --> 21:26.413
There's a doctor here
from the CDC.

21:26.485 --> 21:29.181
He wants to ask you about
the bodies at Cypress Pond.

21:29.254 --> 21:31.984
He was annoyingly insistent.

21:32.057 --> 21:33.581
[coughing]

21:40.799 --> 21:42.426
Sarah's great, huh?

21:42.501 --> 21:45.527
I wish
she were around more.

21:45.604 --> 21:49.040
Um, does she have
a boyfriend?

21:49.107 --> 21:50.335
She's hot, huh?

21:52.311 --> 21:55.178
Oh, she's so hot.

21:56.948 --> 21:59.143
You think she'd ever
go out with a private?

21:59.217 --> 22:02.015
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
I'm a little bit--

22:03.522 --> 22:05.387
Are you all right?

22:05.457 --> 22:07.482
Oh, my God.

22:07.559 --> 22:09.254
You're freezing.

22:09.328 --> 22:10.852
[Man]
I need some help over here!

22:10.929 --> 22:12.021
Come on, man.

22:12.097 --> 22:13.928
Stay with me.
Talk to me, talk to me.

22:13.999 --> 22:15.557
Talk to me,
talk to me, talk to me.

22:15.634 --> 22:16.931
Um...

22:18.370 --> 22:19.701
Okay, um, Mrs. Cross,

22:19.771 --> 22:21.705
I'm going to go get Sarah.

22:21.773 --> 22:23.001
Okay?

22:24.810 --> 22:25.799
Corporal Cross!

22:29.881 --> 22:31.280
It has to be airborne.

22:31.350 --> 22:32.374
But once in the blood,

22:32.451 --> 22:33.782
it mutates faster
than anything else--

22:33.852 --> 22:35.911
Dr. Logan,
this is Corporal Cross.

22:37.489 --> 22:38.615
Thanks for coming.

22:38.690 --> 22:40.817
Can you give us a minute?

22:42.694 --> 22:43.922
I find people
speak more freely

22:43.995 --> 22:46.759
without a superior
officer around.

22:50.936 --> 22:53.427
I'll be outside.

22:55.340 --> 22:57.331
You've had quite a night.

22:57.409 --> 22:59.434
You could say that.

22:59.511 --> 23:01.001
About the bodies,

23:01.079 --> 23:02.842
you said they looked
like they were mauled.

23:02.914 --> 23:04.108
Could it have been
an animal attack?

23:04.182 --> 23:07.151
If an animal can hide
a body in a closet.

23:07.219 --> 23:08.151
The son is missing?

23:08.220 --> 23:09.744
Yes.

23:09.821 --> 23:12.119
Did the wounds
look like bite marks?

23:12.190 --> 23:13.122
What?

23:13.191 --> 23:15.659
It's a simple question.

23:15.727 --> 23:16.887
How would I know?

23:16.962 --> 23:18.259
Maybe it's the avian flu.

23:18.330 --> 23:19.354
Don't say that.

23:19.431 --> 23:21.763
Dad, seriously,
that's so not possible.

23:21.833 --> 23:24.961
I heard about this case
in France where--

23:26.605 --> 23:27.697
Dad?

23:27.773 --> 23:29.968
Daddy, what's wrong?

23:31.910 --> 23:32.968
Dad?

23:35.781 --> 23:38.045
[echoing]
Daddy?

23:38.116 --> 23:40.107
What's going on?

23:42.487 --> 23:43.681
Daddy?

23:43.755 --> 23:45.848
Dad!

23:49.261 --> 23:50.558
Dad?

23:51.763 --> 23:52.889
[growling]

23:52.964 --> 23:54.522
Okay, we-- we really
need a doctor.

23:56.435 --> 23:57.493
Aah!

23:57.569 --> 23:59.332
Aah!

23:59.404 --> 24:00.666
Raah!

24:00.739 --> 24:02.832
Aah!

24:02.908 --> 24:04.876
[crunching]

24:08.780 --> 24:11.146
Sir? Sir?

24:17.456 --> 24:19.185
Corporal, you gotta
come to the waiting room.

24:19.257 --> 24:20.349
Something's happening.

24:20.425 --> 24:22.086
To my mom?
To everybody.

24:22.160 --> 24:24.492
What is it?
Something bad. I don't know.

24:43.715 --> 24:46.741
[Woman]
Hey, I thought you guys left hours ago.

24:46.818 --> 24:49.252
[grunting]

24:49.321 --> 24:50.583
What the--

24:50.655 --> 24:53.249
[screeching]

24:53.325 --> 24:54.952
No! No!

24:56.194 --> 24:59.322
No! Oh! Aah!

24:59.397 --> 25:01.388
Aah!

25:10.775 --> 25:12.402
[zombies groaning]

25:12.477 --> 25:13.774

Oh, my God! Anybody!

25:27.759 --> 25:30.353
[woman crying]
[yelling]

25:30.428 --> 25:33.795
So this chick takes
her top off, right?

25:33.865 --> 25:35.332
[laughs]
And I swear to God--

25:38.837 --> 25:41.931
[electricity crackling]

25:42.007 --> 25:44.498
What the--
[laughs]

25:44.576 --> 25:47.010
Now this here's just
a little too much for this cowboy.

25:47.078 --> 25:48.511
Now, you see this button here?

25:48.580 --> 25:50.070
You press it, and you talk into that

25:50.148 --> 25:51.740
if you've got something
to say to the folks

25:51.816 --> 25:56.082
because my shift has now ended,
and I am going to mosey on home.

25:56.154 --> 25:57.178
[woman screaming]

26:01.159 --> 26:02.148
Or not.

[horn honking, tires squealing]

[car crashes]

26:16.942 --> 26:19.467
Hey, where the hell are you going?

26:28.386 --> 26:30.820
Hey, I thought you said
there were two bodies.

26:30.889 --> 26:32.880
Yeah.
Now there's three.

26:32.958 --> 26:34.721
Show me.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.059
[pounding at door]

26:45.170 --> 26:47.035
Freeze!
Oh!

26:47.105 --> 26:48.402
[gunshots]

27:05.724 --> 27:08.557
Are you sure
this is a good idea?

27:08.627 --> 27:12.154
Hey, maybe you shouldn't
go down there!

27:17.202 --> 27:19.295
Huh?
[groaning]

27:21.740 --> 27:24.732
Aah! Aah!

27:25.977 --> 27:28.309
What the fuck?

27:28.380 --> 27:31.543
[shrieking]

27:45.964 --> 27:48.228
What the fuck?

27:48.299 --> 27:49.561

Aah! Aah!

Come on, come on,
come on.

28:14.459 --> 28:16.120
[screaming]

28:16.194 --> 28:17.559
Go, go, go, go.

Here they come!

28:45.657 --> 28:46.885
Aah!

28:46.958 --> 28:49.290
What the fuck was that?

28:58.269 --> 28:59.395
Let me in!

29:02.941 --> 29:04.169
Come on. Come on.

29:19.557 --> 29:20.956
What the hell?

29:28.333 --> 29:30.198
What the hell is happening
to these people?

29:30.268 --> 29:31.360
I don't know.

29:31.436 --> 29:32.835
Where's the basement?

29:32.904 --> 29:33.893
Right there.

29:33.972 --> 29:35.530
My mom's in there.

29:35.607 --> 29:36.596
We'll go undercover.

29:36.674 --> 29:37.732
That's an order, Corporal!

29:55.927 --> 29:57.053
Come on!

30:00.999 --> 30:01.931
Here.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.490
We're safe!

30:09.007 --> 30:09.974
Grrr!

30:10.041 --> 30:11.440
Aah!

30:17.849 --> 30:20.340
What the hell was that?
You almost got me killed.

30:20.418 --> 30:22.511
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?

30:22.587 --> 30:24.282
[Sarah]
Bud! Help me.

30:24.355 --> 30:25.754
[knocking]

30:39.671 --> 30:41.104
[horn honks]

30:42.807 --> 30:43.796
Oh, my God.

30:48.046 --> 30:49.741
[knocking]

30:49.814 --> 30:51.475
What are we going to do?

31:06.197 --> 31:07.323
Aah!
Aah!

31:07.398 --> 31:08.330
Fuck!

31:08.399 --> 31:09.491
[sobbing]

31:09.567 --> 31:10.659
Come on.

31:17.008 --> 31:18.737
Aah!

31:39.764 --> 31:41.959
Look at the radio station.

31:42.033 --> 31:44.001
Look, there's somebody
in there.

31:45.770 --> 31:48.000
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

31:48.072 --> 31:49.232
Hey.

31:49.307 --> 31:52.174
We're going to make it,
okay?

31:52.243 --> 31:53.938
I swear.

32:21.940 --> 32:24.534
We can make Molotov cocktails.

32:24.609 --> 32:27.669
Great, and I'll just build a bus
and drive us out of here.

32:27.745 --> 32:29.212
Come on,
we have weapons.

32:29.280 --> 32:30.611
I don't have a gun.
What?

32:30.682 --> 32:32.582
I'm in communications.
We aren't issued weapons.

32:32.650 --> 32:34.140
So basically you're useless.

32:34.218 --> 32:35.185
Shut up, Logan.

32:35.253 --> 32:36.345
Come on.
You've got one.

32:36.421 --> 32:37.649
We can shoot
enough of them.

32:37.722 --> 32:39.087
It's not loaded.

32:39.157 --> 32:41.182
Oh, you've got
to be kidding me.

32:41.259 --> 32:43.124
What the hell kind
of soldier are you?

32:43.194 --> 32:45.719
You don't want to find out
right now, okay?

32:45.797 --> 32:47.560
Bud, where did you park the Humvee?

32:47.632 --> 32:50.601
The lot was full, so l--
Oh, shit.

32:50.668 --> 32:52.260
They must have come out
when I was--

32:52.337 --> 32:55.101
Great. A driver without keys
and a soldier without bullets.

32:55.173 --> 32:56.731
It must be my fucking birthday.

32:56.808 --> 32:58.275
What's with you two?

32:58.343 --> 33:00.334
You know what?
It's complicated, okay, pal?

33:00.411 --> 33:01.605
How did you get here?

33:01.679 --> 33:02.611
Taxi.

33:02.680 --> 33:04.272
Great. Well, you're nominated

33:04.349 --> 33:06.374
to go out
and hail us another one.

33:15.860 --> 33:17.919
Captain Rhodes' Humvee.

33:17.996 --> 33:20.556
He should have the keys on him.
We've got to go get them.

33:20.631 --> 33:22.326
What? No! No. No way!

33:22.400 --> 33:23.628
Those things are everywhere.

33:27.305 --> 33:29.500
Not everywhere.

33:35.246 --> 33:36.474
Come on.

33:42.487 --> 33:44.478
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

33:44.555 --> 33:45.852
Hello.

33:45.923 --> 33:47.914
Hello. Hello, hello, hello!

33:47.992 --> 33:48.924
Somebody.

33:48.993 --> 33:50.517
Hello! Hello?

33:50.595 --> 33:52.153
Stop pounding. Look!

33:52.230 --> 33:53.788
Oh, God! Oh, God!

33:53.865 --> 33:56.197
Oh, God!
Shh!

33:56.267 --> 33:57.393
Oh, God, I'm gonna die!

33:57.468 --> 33:58.799
Open the damn door!

33:58.870 --> 34:00.030
Grrr!

34:00.104 --> 34:02.629
Open the door now!

34:02.707 --> 34:03.799
Open up!

34:03.875 --> 34:05.342
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

34:05.410 --> 34:06.570
Open the door!

34:06.644 --> 34:08.110
Someone help!

34:08.179 --> 34:09.873
Someone open the door!

34:09.947 --> 34:11.938
Oh, God! Hurry! Hurry!

34:14.719 --> 34:16.687
Are you one of them?
No!

34:16.754 --> 34:18.016
Are you sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.

34:18.089 --> 34:19.317
You better not be!

34:26.664 --> 34:29.632
Mr. and Mrs. Leitner.
Oh, you're all right.

34:29.699 --> 34:32.760
Where's Cody?
Is he okay? Is he--

34:33.905 --> 34:36.339
We wanted to get Cody
to a doctor,

34:36.407 --> 34:38.637
but your sister
wouldn't let us,

34:38.708 --> 34:39.869
and now he's dead.

34:39.944 --> 34:41.377
[Mrs. Leitner]
Andrew, stop it!

34:41.446 --> 34:42.844
[cough]

34:46.918 --> 34:50.149
My cough--
I had it before all this.

34:50.221 --> 34:51.984
I'm not sick.

34:52.056 --> 34:54.047
[coughing]

35:04.402 --> 35:05.391
Come on.

35:18.749 --> 35:21.741
[zombies growling]

35:22.753 --> 35:23.879
Jesus.

35:32.063 --> 35:33.223
Raah!

35:33.297 --> 35:35.765
Sweet mother of God!
Don't--

35:37.201 --> 35:38.634
Yuck!

35:39.804 --> 35:41.066
God.

35:59.991 --> 36:01.515
[Bud]
Do you want me to go?

36:01.592 --> 36:05.050
Yeah. But I outrank you.

36:10.635 --> 36:12.262
Okay.

36:26.417 --> 36:27.441
[door opens]

36:29.754 --> 36:32.222
Salazar. Are you all right?

36:32.290 --> 36:35.123
Not if you keep
karate kicking me.

36:36.794 --> 36:38.284
How did you get away?

36:38.362 --> 36:42.389
When everybody started tripping,
I just jumped in the closet.

36:42.466 --> 36:43.956
Keep laughing, bitch.

36:44.035 --> 36:46.663
All right,
I'm taking Rhodes' Humvee.

36:46.737 --> 36:48.204
Oh, man.

36:48.272 --> 36:50.467
You won't be needing this.

36:57.081 --> 36:58.810
I got 'em. Let's go.

37:01.686 --> 37:04.120
Correct, my shit. Uhh!

37:04.188 --> 37:05.655
Go.

37:27.311 --> 37:28.369
Grrr!
No!

37:28.446 --> 37:29.640
What?
What happened?

37:29.714 --> 37:31.204
What is it?
Aah!

37:32.383 --> 37:34.180
Give me some room! Go!

37:34.252 --> 37:35.651
Come on!

37:35.720 --> 37:37.119
He's got me!

37:37.188 --> 37:38.212
Grrr!

37:39.890 --> 37:41.050
Stop!

37:42.860 --> 37:45.226
Pull!

37:45.296 --> 37:46.923
Let's go! Come on!

37:46.998 --> 37:48.090
Go!

38:19.297 --> 38:20.628
Aah!

38:30.975 --> 38:32.567
Aah!

38:39.550 --> 38:41.017
Catch! Come on!

38:42.186 --> 38:43.676
Pull!

39:11.048 --> 39:13.516
Tell me you remembered
the keys.

39:13.584 --> 39:15.108
Raah!

39:15.186 --> 39:17.313
Aah! God!

39:19.190 --> 39:20.418
God!

39:22.059 --> 39:23.492
Ah, fuck, he got me.

39:23.561 --> 39:26.121
Oh, fuck, he got me.

39:26.197 --> 39:28.597
Oh, fuck, he got me.
He got me.

39:28.666 --> 39:30.657
I'm sorry.

39:30.735 --> 39:35.297
Aah! Aah! Aah!

39:35.373 --> 39:38.240
Aah! Oh, fuck!

39:40.778 --> 39:42.302
This is gonna be quick.

39:42.380 --> 39:43.608
No, no!

39:43.681 --> 39:45.148
You saw what happened
to Rhodes

39:45.216 --> 39:47.343
when he got bit, okay?

39:47.418 --> 39:48.612
This is the only way.

39:48.686 --> 39:50.017
I put bleach on it.

39:50.087 --> 39:52.749
[growling from above]

39:52.823 --> 39:54.188
Shut up!

39:54.258 --> 39:56.249
Put the gun down.
That's an order.

39:56.327 --> 39:58.522
I don't know if you noticed,

39:58.596 --> 40:00.826
but there's people out there
eating each other, okay?

40:00.898 --> 40:02.763
So fuck you and your orders.

40:02.833 --> 40:04.164
[growling from above]

40:04.235 --> 40:06.601
I said shut up!

40:07.872 --> 40:10.306
What are you going to do?
You going to shoot me?

40:10.374 --> 40:12.672
Hey, look, Rhodes was bitten
hundreds of times, him once.

40:12.743 --> 40:14.973
Besides, bleach kills
just about everything.

40:15.045 --> 40:16.307
Who the fuck are you?

40:16.380 --> 40:18.712
Look, I'm a doctor, okay?
I know exactly what's--

40:18.783 --> 40:21.343
Man, ain't nobody trying
to hear that CSI bullshit.

40:21.419 --> 40:23.319
He gotta go.

40:23.387 --> 40:25.287
[growling from above]

40:25.356 --> 40:27.984
Didn't I say
shut the fuck up?

40:32.730 --> 40:34.391
Sir.

40:34.465 --> 40:36.695
Look, I will take responsibility for him.

40:36.767 --> 40:40.669
And if the time comes, I'll
do what has to be done, okay?

40:40.738 --> 40:42.365
So just back down!

40:52.316 --> 40:55.410
Look, I ain't got time
for this bullshit.

40:55.486 --> 40:58.011
We need to figure out
how to get the fuck out of here.

40:58.088 --> 40:59.214
I'm watching.

40:59.290 --> 41:00.917
My eye's on you!

41:11.135 --> 41:14.901
Call the police, the National Guard,

41:14.972 --> 41:18.965
and if by any slim chance
the fucking FCC are listening,

41:19.043 --> 41:20.340
they might take notice.

41:20.411 --> 41:23.141
[coughing]

41:25.716 --> 41:27.206
I gotta take a break.

41:27.284 --> 41:29.514
This fucking blood
pressure's killing me.

41:29.587 --> 41:32.556
I shouldn't have done
that kumquat diet.

41:32.623 --> 41:35.456
It's probably too late
to stop smoking.

41:40.998 --> 41:42.397
I'm the one who should be worried.

41:42.466 --> 41:44.400
Your wife's been hacking up
a storm since you got here.

41:44.468 --> 41:45.560
What are you trying to say?

41:45.636 --> 41:46.762
Can I give this a try?

41:46.837 --> 41:48.065
Hey, you got a license?

41:48.138 --> 41:49.332
No.

41:49.406 --> 41:50.395
Me, neither.

41:52.476 --> 41:54.341
I ain't got a fucking license.

42:02.686 --> 42:03.653
If anyone's there--

42:03.721 --> 42:04.915
You go, kid.

42:04.989 --> 42:07.457
If anyone can hear this,
we are trapped at the radio station

42:07.525 --> 42:11.154
KXWT on Elm Street
in Leadville, Colorado.

42:11.228 --> 42:15.096
Uh, uh, we are under attack.
Repeat. We are under attack.

42:15.165 --> 42:17.065
If anyone is there at all--

42:17.134 --> 42:18.396
[growling, moaning]

42:18.469 --> 42:21.029
... we need help. Okay?
Something 's happening.

42:21.105 --> 42:22.936
People are going out of their minds.

42:23.007 --> 42:24.907
Please, please,
please, send help.

42:24.975 --> 42:26.067
There's five of us here.

42:26.143 --> 42:28.077
It's me, my girlfriend Nina,

42:28.145 --> 42:29.737
Mr. and Mrs. Leitner, and the DJ.

42:29.813 --> 42:31.974
Just somebody
send something, okay?

42:32.049 --> 42:35.348
We're at the radio station
KXWT on Elm Street.

42:35.419 --> 42:40.186
Oh, oh, and if you hear my voice,
do not go to the Pine Valley Hospital.

42:40.257 --> 42:41.485
Okay? It's not safe there.

42:41.559 --> 42:44.119
Repeat. Do not go to the hospital.

42:49.266 --> 42:51.200
[Sarah]
We should go now.

42:53.170 --> 42:54.694
Okay.

42:54.772 --> 42:56.262
Take this and give me
one of your guns.

42:56.340 --> 42:58.535
What, you little
Miss MacGyver now?

42:58.609 --> 43:00.372
That shit ain't gonna work.

43:02.813 --> 43:04.747
Give me one of your guns.

43:04.815 --> 43:05.907
If something happens to you,

43:05.983 --> 43:07.245
we can't risk
losing both of them.

43:10.988 --> 43:13.957
I know how to shoot
one of those.

43:14.024 --> 43:16.015
I bet you do.

43:17.061 --> 43:18.551
Sweet spear.

43:19.897 --> 43:21.956
You see a black man
with a sharp stick

43:22.032 --> 43:23.056
and it's supposed
to be a spear?

43:23.133 --> 43:24.623
Oh, no,
that's not what l--

43:24.702 --> 43:27.535
Bud, can you throw this
chair through the window?

43:27.605 --> 43:29.038
Yeah.

43:31.208 --> 43:32.698
Do you have your lighter?
Yeah.

43:32.776 --> 43:34.073
Let's do this.
Are you ready?

43:34.144 --> 43:36.339
Yeah.

43:36.413 --> 43:38.711
Okay...Now!

43:57.534 --> 43:59.297
You gotta shoot them
in the head.

43:59.370 --> 44:00.598
Raah!

44:02.306 --> 44:04.638
Oh, my God!

44:09.613 --> 44:10.602
Jesus!

44:13.951 --> 44:15.543
Oh, my God.

44:18.022 --> 44:19.387
Let's go, Doc!

44:24.628 --> 44:25.686
Watch out!

44:33.337 --> 44:34.895
Shit!

44:37.341 --> 44:39.571
Watch out!

44:45.783 --> 44:48.650
[Sarah]
Oh, shit.

44:52.122 --> 44:53.453
Let's go.

45:38.535 --> 45:40.264
Please help me.

45:40.337 --> 45:41.998
I'll help you.

45:43.574 --> 45:44.973
Aah!

45:52.282 --> 45:53.749
Come on, y'all!

45:55.619 --> 45:56.608
I got him!

45:58.922 --> 45:59.854
I'm out.

45:59.923 --> 46:02.050
Me, too. Shit.

46:02.126 --> 46:04.094
Where's Logan?

46:04.161 --> 46:06.095
[car engine starts]

46:06.163 --> 46:08.859
[woman screams]

46:12.236 --> 46:14.830
What a dick.

46:17.508 --> 46:19.373
There's more of
these motherfuckers?

46:19.443 --> 46:20.876
Light 'em.

46:22.146 --> 46:24.580
Come on.

46:24.648 --> 46:26.707
Okay.

46:33.657 --> 46:35.784
Oh, shit!

46:51.775 --> 46:53.265
That worked.

46:53.343 --> 46:54.537
Yeah.

47:05.956 --> 47:07.082
Behind you!

47:12.596 --> 47:13.688
Nice shot.

47:13.764 --> 47:15.629
It was kinda gangsta, huh?

47:20.671 --> 47:22.104
We gotta get some more ammo.

47:22.172 --> 47:24.072
Hang on.

47:41.558 --> 47:44.322
This is bullshit.

48:36.013 --> 48:38.311
Hey, yo, Gomer.

48:38.382 --> 48:40.350
Don't give up, man.

48:42.920 --> 48:44.649
Yeah, I won't.

48:47.724 --> 48:49.191
Shit!

48:56.199 --> 48:58.759
What you dodging them for?
Run their ass over.

48:58.835 --> 48:59.767
They're still somebody.

48:59.836 --> 49:01.736
Not anymore.

49:41.945 --> 49:43.173
That was kinda fun.

49:45.716 --> 49:47.274
That is unbelievable.

49:47.351 --> 49:48.784
We have
to get out of here.

49:48.852 --> 49:50.046
Do you have a car?

49:50.120 --> 49:51.417
No, I ain't going out there.

49:51.488 --> 49:53.752
Hey, dude, if you're feeling lucky,
you go for it.

49:53.824 --> 49:55.655
I'd be like prime rib
to those fuckers.

49:55.726 --> 49:57.591
I'm sitting my fat ass right here
till the help comes.

49:57.661 --> 49:59.492
Let's just wait.
Somebody will come.

49:59.563 --> 50:01.224
They have to.

50:01.298 --> 50:02.959
[door creaks]

50:18.148 --> 50:20.548
So which one of you
had the nosebleed?

50:20.617 --> 50:22.312
What?
You heard her.

50:22.386 --> 50:23.512
Anybody have a nosebleed?

50:23.587 --> 50:26.886
Just sit down and
answer the question.

50:26.957 --> 50:28.254
What is wrong with you?

50:28.325 --> 50:30.623
Nina, put that down.
What are you doing?

50:30.694 --> 50:32.161
Everyone who changed
had a nosebleed.

50:32.229 --> 50:33.196
Who's lying?

50:33.263 --> 50:34.423
Had to be one of them.

50:34.498 --> 50:36.762
I said sit down.

50:36.833 --> 50:39.631
Hey, you don't wanna eat this.
Major indigestion.

50:39.703 --> 50:41.728
She hasn't had a nosebleed,
and neither have l.

50:41.805 --> 50:43.102
Look at them.
They're covered in blood.

50:43.173 --> 50:44.572
Shut up!

50:44.641 --> 50:45.630
My son attacked a nurse.

50:45.709 --> 50:47.108
It's her blood!

50:47.177 --> 50:48.269
Hey, check them
for bite marks.

50:48.345 --> 50:49.312
No one's touching my wife.

50:49.379 --> 50:50.346
Just answer
the fucking question!

50:50.414 --> 50:52.541
Don't you get it?

50:52.616 --> 50:54.675
Someone in here is infected.

50:54.751 --> 50:57.652
We're all in danger.

51:10.600 --> 51:11.692
[Sarah]
All right. Let's make this quick.

51:11.768 --> 51:14.532
What about
your boy back here?

51:14.604 --> 51:18.040
Bud, I'm sorry.

51:18.108 --> 51:20.668
No, no. I understand.

51:26.116 --> 51:27.413
You all right?

51:27.484 --> 51:29.247
Yeah.

51:29.319 --> 51:30.308
Do me a favor.

51:30.387 --> 51:31.979
Yeah. Anything.

51:32.055 --> 51:37.789
Grab me a gun, too,
and, um, load mine.

51:52.409 --> 51:55.606
Yeah, that's the type of
shit I'm talking about.

51:57.080 --> 51:59.981
Ooh. Uh-huh. Yeah.

52:21.571 --> 52:23.732
Fucking tell us.

52:23.807 --> 52:24.831
Yeah. Now, just--

52:24.908 --> 52:25.932
Ah...

52:27.410 --> 52:28.536
choo!

52:31.181 --> 52:32.614
Oh, God.

52:32.682 --> 52:34.513
You scared me.

52:34.584 --> 52:36.449
Paul?

52:38.188 --> 52:39.815
Get off the couch!

52:53.837 --> 52:54.769
Okay.

52:54.838 --> 52:55.862
Is anyone alive out there?

52:55.939 --> 52:57.873
Can anyone hear me?
Anyone? Anyone?

52:57.941 --> 53:00.239
The police? Someone?
We just need someone.

53:00.310 --> 53:01.504
Something's fucking happened.

53:01.578 --> 53:03.546
We need someone. Please, anyone.

53:05.882 --> 53:07.713
Don't think they know
who they fucking with.

53:07.784 --> 53:09.513
Automatics
have no firepower.

53:09.586 --> 53:13.044
Oh, yeah? Says who?

53:17.627 --> 53:20.755
This shit right here
was made for me.

53:20.830 --> 53:22.195
Uh-huh. Whoo.

53:22.265 --> 53:24.927
By the power of Grayskull.

53:26.002 --> 53:27.060
Okay.
Yeah.

53:27.137 --> 53:28.069
Stop fucking around

53:28.138 --> 53:29.070
and start loading
the stuff up.

53:29.139 --> 53:30.902
How long you gonna
keep cussing at me?

53:30.974 --> 53:33.340
You see this? This is a machete.

53:33.410 --> 53:37.471
Unappreciative ass.
See if I save your ass again.

53:44.955 --> 53:46.183
Oh, shit.

53:46.256 --> 53:48.816
No! He's restrained.

53:48.892 --> 53:49.916
What if he gets loose?

53:51.928 --> 53:53.862
Then I'll shoot him.

53:53.930 --> 53:55.363
Look, I'm not riding
with this motherfucker.

53:55.432 --> 53:58.230
Yes!
Shut the fuck up!

53:59.869 --> 54:01.131
My, God, he listened.

54:22.225 --> 54:24.659
[Radio]
Sales of new homes rose--

54:24.728 --> 54:26.821
Plus, with pop--

54:26.896 --> 54:29.057
Ever since day one--

54:29.132 --> 54:30.156
I don't understand.

54:30.233 --> 54:32.224
They're not saying
anything about this.

54:32.302 --> 54:33.633
Word hasn't gotten out yet.

54:33.703 --> 54:34.931
... the Army, the National Guard,

54:35.005 --> 54:36.529
anyone with weapons...

54:36.606 --> 54:37.538
Oh, my God.

54:37.607 --> 54:38.801
Is anyone still alive?

54:40.477 --> 54:42.911
What the hell are you doing?

54:44.247 --> 54:46.078
Out of town
is the other way.

54:48.852 --> 54:50.251
That's my brother.

54:50.320 --> 54:51.719
Your brother's a DJ?

54:53.823 --> 54:55.586
Just send someone.
We're being attacked.

54:55.659 --> 54:57.889
We need help.
We need help now.

54:57.961 --> 55:00.521
Damn it, where the fuck
is the cavalry?

55:00.597 --> 55:02.428
What are you doing?

55:06.269 --> 55:07.759
Oh, my God. Mom!

55:07.837 --> 55:09.737
Trevor!
I have to let her in!

55:09.806 --> 55:11.034
Trevor, wait!

55:24.954 --> 55:26.421
Oh, shit!

55:28.825 --> 55:30.793
That's what I'm talking about!

55:30.860 --> 55:33.090
Run their ass over!

55:36.333 --> 55:37.994
Now you're driving.

55:40.770 --> 55:42.328
Wait! Wait!

55:42.405 --> 55:43.997
She could be infected!
No!

55:45.208 --> 55:47.199
Why'd you lie
about the nosebleed?

55:47.277 --> 55:49.142
Don't worry. It'll be fine.

55:49.212 --> 55:50.702
I promise.

55:50.780 --> 55:51.712
Mom!

55:51.781 --> 55:53.271
Trevor!

55:57.354 --> 55:58.821
Aah!

56:00.990 --> 56:02.184
Oh, God.

56:05.395 --> 56:06.919
Trevor.

56:08.431 --> 56:09.762
Trevor, it wasn't her.

56:09.833 --> 56:12.165
Not anymore.

56:14.904 --> 56:16.735
Nina, is there
anybody else up there?

56:16.806 --> 56:17.932
Yes.

56:18.007 --> 56:19.565
Bring them down.
We're getting out of here.

56:19.642 --> 56:20.574
We are?

56:20.643 --> 56:22.304
Go!

56:22.379 --> 56:23.539
Okay. Okay. Okay.

56:25.815 --> 56:28.249
Mr. and Mrs. Leitner,
we've been rescued. Come on.

56:30.220 --> 56:33.053
It's time to go.

56:42.532 --> 56:44.329
[clatter]

56:48.204 --> 56:51.139
Mr. and Mrs. Leitner?

57:14.264 --> 57:16.232
No!

57:18.968 --> 57:21.528
Raah!
Aah!

57:24.741 --> 57:27.574
Trevor, I'm sorry.

57:30.213 --> 57:32.044
Yo, survivors.

57:32.115 --> 57:33.446
Hello!

57:35.218 --> 57:36.150
[Salazar]
Come on.

57:36.219 --> 57:39.120
It's soldiers. Come on!

57:39.189 --> 57:41.487
Aah!

57:57.941 --> 58:00.307
Nina! Hey!

58:12.689 --> 58:14.054
Quick, get over here.

58:14.123 --> 58:15.556
Come on, man.
They're coming, man.

58:15.625 --> 58:16.751
Hurry up. They're coming!

58:16.826 --> 58:20.159
Aah! Oh, no! Oh, no!

58:21.798 --> 58:22.787
We need to leave.

58:38.515 --> 58:41.382
[zombies moaning]

58:44.053 --> 58:46.078
Let's go!

59:01.204 --> 59:03.138
This shit is ridiculous.

59:03.206 --> 59:06.334
I mean, why Thriller over here
ain't trying to eat us?

59:06.409 --> 59:08.604
He's a vegetarian.

59:10.813 --> 59:13.338
That's the best explanation
you can come up with?

59:13.416 --> 59:15.543
You got a better one?

59:15.618 --> 59:18.178
All I'm saying, as long
as he don't try to mistake me

59:18.254 --> 59:20.814
for a soybean burger,
we gonna be all right.

59:24.727 --> 59:27.457
They seem to retain
some part of themselves

59:27.530 --> 59:29.327
before they were infected.

59:29.399 --> 59:30.559
Must've retained his hormones

59:30.633 --> 59:32.567
because he definitely
remembers who you are.

59:34.938 --> 59:37.873
Guess that also means
he remembers who was boss,

59:37.941 --> 59:39.636
huh, bitch?
[groans]

59:39.709 --> 59:42.371
Bad soldier.

59:42.445 --> 59:43.810
Ten hut!

59:48.451 --> 59:50.646
That's some crazy-ass shit.

01:00:04.901 --> 01:00:06.232
Williams,
Captain Rhodes is down.

01:00:06.302 --> 01:00:08.031
Do you have any idea
where--

01:00:08.104 --> 01:00:10.004
[screaming, shouting]

01:00:27.090 --> 01:00:29.251
Check if the SATCOM's working.

01:00:30.326 --> 01:00:32.385
[shouting]

01:00:42.038 --> 01:00:43.562
Come on. Let's go!

01:00:46.976 --> 01:00:49.103
Let's get out of here!

01:01:16.305 --> 01:01:17.237
Whoo!

01:01:17.306 --> 01:01:19.103
Them fools were shooting at me!

01:01:24.781 --> 01:01:26.806
What we taking,
a back road out of here?

01:01:26.883 --> 01:01:28.145
There is no back road.

01:01:28.217 --> 01:01:30.048
Sarah, go up
Hidden Lake Road.

01:01:30.119 --> 01:01:31.711
We could get to Boulder
on the fire road.

01:01:31.788 --> 01:01:34.552
Yeah, you're right.
Good thinking.

01:01:36.559 --> 01:01:38.220
Okay, hold on.

01:02:08.958 --> 01:02:11.222
Hey.

01:02:11.294 --> 01:02:13.489
You okay?

01:02:14.897 --> 01:02:17.024
Remember I said
we're gonna make it?

01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:19.330
We are.

01:02:24.006 --> 01:02:26.338
[sighs]

01:02:26.409 --> 01:02:28.400
Never going back, are we?

01:02:28.478 --> 01:02:32.346
I don't know, Trevor.

01:02:32.415 --> 01:02:35.680
You know, why did you
leave in the first place

01:02:35.752 --> 01:02:36.844
instead of opening
the bike shop?

01:02:36.919 --> 01:02:38.409
You think I was gonna
wait around for you

01:02:38.488 --> 01:02:39.978
to get your shit together?
Who built the first bike?

01:02:40.056 --> 01:02:41.580
That broke
and almost killed me

01:02:41.657 --> 01:02:43.682
when we were, like,
50 miles from home?

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:46.558
Could y'all save that shit
for Oprah, please?

01:02:46.629 --> 01:02:48.392
[hiss]

01:02:48.464 --> 01:02:50.091
What the fuck was that?

01:02:58.141 --> 01:02:59.165
Kyle.

01:03:02.145 --> 01:03:04.272
[hissing, shouting]

01:03:24.534 --> 01:03:26.024
Come on, get out!

01:03:28.671 --> 01:03:31.367
What's happening, player?

01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:32.532
[groans]

01:03:32.608 --> 01:03:33.802
At ease, soldier.

01:03:41.284 --> 01:03:43.514
All right.

01:03:43.586 --> 01:03:45.417
Kyle.

01:03:49.125 --> 01:03:51.059
Is there any reason
why we're keeping this bitch around?

01:03:51.127 --> 01:03:54.722
Everyone grab as much
firepower as you can.

01:03:54.797 --> 01:03:56.287
Look at that shit.

01:03:56.365 --> 01:03:58.299
He likes you.

01:03:58.367 --> 01:04:00.301
Got a little zombie crush.

01:04:00.369 --> 01:04:03.270
We need to find cover,
some place we an defend.

01:04:03.339 --> 01:04:04.863
The old Nike site's
about a mile from here.

01:04:04.941 --> 01:04:07.273
Yeah, you're right,
we can hole up there,

01:04:07.343 --> 01:04:08.708
wait for daylight.
Good call.

01:04:08.778 --> 01:04:11.246
All right, we're gonna
keep Bud with us.

01:04:11.314 --> 01:04:12.542
Why?

01:04:12.615 --> 01:04:14.014
He might be useful
against them.

01:04:14.083 --> 01:04:16.176
And he follows orders.
I like that.

01:04:16.252 --> 01:04:18.379
But if he tries anything...

01:04:18.454 --> 01:04:21.150
Head shot.

01:04:21.224 --> 01:04:23.818
Yeah, come on,
Mr. Follows Orders.

01:04:23.893 --> 01:04:25.121
About face!

01:04:28.631 --> 01:04:29.723
Oh, my--

01:04:29.799 --> 01:04:31.630
Forward march!

01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:39.507
[growling]

01:04:39.575 --> 01:04:40.940
What was that?

01:04:41.010 --> 01:04:43.672
I don't know,
but be ready for anything.

01:04:43.746 --> 01:04:45.714
Let's move out!

01:05:10.373 --> 01:05:12.534
Come on, let's go.

01:05:13.743 --> 01:05:16.211
Have a seat.

01:05:17.747 --> 01:05:19.305
[door closes]

01:05:21.217 --> 01:05:22.514
What the hell
you looking at?

01:05:25.221 --> 01:05:27.416
I know you're not
looking at her ass.

01:05:27.490 --> 01:05:29.390
I think ol' Gomer
over here wants--

01:05:29.458 --> 01:05:30.390
Grrr!

01:05:30.459 --> 01:05:32.950
Salazar,
leave him alone!

01:05:33.029 --> 01:05:34.291
Trevor.

01:05:34.363 --> 01:05:35.295
Good idea.

01:05:35.364 --> 01:05:36.956
I'll lead with this.

01:05:37.033 --> 01:05:39.126
Don't count on me.

01:05:39.201 --> 01:05:41.897
Look, you wanna drop
the passive aggressive bullshit

01:05:41.971 --> 01:05:43.632
for once, please?

01:05:43.706 --> 01:05:46.300
Over some bicycles?
What's with you two?

01:05:46.375 --> 01:05:48.536
It's complicated.

01:05:49.578 --> 01:05:50.875
He's a kid.

01:05:50.947 --> 01:05:52.710
Yeah, but we all have
to grow up sometime.

01:05:52.782 --> 01:05:54.215
Now would be nice.

01:05:54.283 --> 01:05:55.511
[groaning, moaning]

01:05:55.584 --> 01:05:57.142
[screaming]

01:05:57.219 --> 01:05:59.210
Bud! Bud! Stop it!

01:05:59.288 --> 01:06:00.755
[screaming]

01:06:00.823 --> 01:06:03.815
Bud! Bud, stop it!

01:06:03.893 --> 01:06:05.360
[screaming]

01:06:10.533 --> 01:06:12.501
Aah!

01:06:15.104 --> 01:06:16.765
Let's go!

01:06:19.342 --> 01:06:21.537
Hey! Follow me!

01:06:41.897 --> 01:06:42.829
This way!

01:06:42.898 --> 01:06:44.024
Let's go!

01:06:45.434 --> 01:06:46.765
Whoa.

01:07:05.287 --> 01:07:07.118
Hey, guys.

01:07:09.959 --> 01:07:12.189
Come on!
Cover him!

01:07:27.443 --> 01:07:28.432
Nice shot.

01:07:28.511 --> 01:07:29.535
Thanks.

01:07:33.416 --> 01:07:35.441
Hey, come on.

01:07:40.556 --> 01:07:42.990
[Salazar]
What the hell?

01:07:49.198 --> 01:07:50.859
A Puffy video.

01:08:02.711 --> 01:08:05.043
Of course.
[crash]

01:08:05.114 --> 01:08:07.275
Yo, we got company.

01:08:07.349 --> 01:08:08.714
Trevor, you loaded?

01:08:08.784 --> 01:08:10.513
Full up.

01:08:10.586 --> 01:08:12.918
All right, stay here with Nina, okay?
We'll be back.

01:09:12.281 --> 01:09:14.715
Wait, please don't shoot!
Don't shoot!

01:09:14.783 --> 01:09:16.683
The fuck are you doing here?

01:09:16.752 --> 01:09:19.118
I-- I was trying to get away.

01:09:19.188 --> 01:09:20.678
Those things were after me.

01:09:20.756 --> 01:09:22.689
I found this compound.
I just came here for shelter.

01:09:22.758 --> 01:09:24.589
So you took off
to save your own ass?

01:09:24.660 --> 01:09:25.786
No.

01:09:25.861 --> 01:09:27.089
And destroy some kind
of evidence, huh?

01:09:29.064 --> 01:09:31.294
Says something
about Project Wildfire.

01:09:31.367 --> 01:09:34.598
Your name's on every one of them.

01:09:34.670 --> 01:09:36.136
What is
Project Wildfire?

01:09:36.205 --> 01:09:37.433
I don't know how my name--

01:09:37.506 --> 01:09:39.269
Listen to me!
My mom's dead.

01:09:39.341 --> 01:09:42.139
My hometown's turned into
a fucking slaughterhouse.

01:09:42.211 --> 01:09:43.542
You either tell me
what you know,

01:09:43.612 --> 01:09:45.671
or so help me, I will
shoot you dead right here.

01:09:45.747 --> 01:09:47.773
Look, if you'll just
give me a second to explain--

01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:49.578
[chambers round]

01:09:49.652 --> 01:09:50.913
Don't lie to her.

01:09:50.986 --> 01:09:51.975
If you'll let me finish--

01:09:52.054 --> 01:09:54.078
Go ahead.

01:09:55.291 --> 01:09:58.158
There were a few select scientists
studying certain biochemical agents.

01:09:58.227 --> 01:09:59.717
Including you?

01:10:00.796 --> 01:10:02.195
Were you studying them
or creating them?

01:10:02.264 --> 01:10:05.825
Look, I was in Washington
to give a report.

01:10:05.901 --> 01:10:07.630
I couldn't reach anyone here.

01:10:07.703 --> 01:10:10.695
Then I heard about the quarantine.

01:10:10.773 --> 01:10:13.765
Look, we don't know our
research has anything to do

01:10:13.842 --> 01:10:14.968
with this outbreak.

01:10:15.044 --> 01:10:16.739
Yes, we do.

01:10:21.817 --> 01:10:23.580
Ahem.

01:10:23.652 --> 01:10:25.017
The virus--

01:10:25.087 --> 01:10:26.054
It was three days ago.

01:10:26.121 --> 01:10:28.589
...has mutated, and somehow

01:10:28.657 --> 01:10:31.592
we have all become
infected or eaten,

01:10:31.660 --> 01:10:33.127
and I'm the last.

01:10:33.195 --> 01:10:34.685
I think I've killed them all:

01:10:34.763 --> 01:10:38.563
Tom, Grace, and everyone.

01:10:38.634 --> 01:10:41.296
I, uh...[gagging]

01:10:41.370 --> 01:10:44.168
have sealed myself
inside this bunker.

01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:47.505
I've destroyed the samples
and archived my notes.

01:10:47.576 --> 01:10:51.034
And I don 't know why the infection
is moving so slowly,

01:10:51.113 --> 01:10:53.206
but I can feel it.

01:10:53.282 --> 01:10:55.716
I can feel the malevolence.

01:10:55.784 --> 01:11:00.380
I'll die here like the pharaohs

01:11:00.456 --> 01:11:04.392
with my legacy,
a beautiful weapon...

01:11:04.460 --> 01:11:07.520
beautiful weapon.

01:11:17.773 --> 01:11:20.003
What was this virus
supposed to do?

01:11:20.075 --> 01:11:21.804
It was designed
to paralyze enemy troops

01:11:21.877 --> 01:11:23.242
by shutting down
their neural system

01:11:23.312 --> 01:11:25.371
for six to seven hours.

01:11:25.447 --> 01:11:26.914
We didn't think
it would mutate.

01:11:26.982 --> 01:11:28.313
Come on,
this would have allowed us

01:11:28.384 --> 01:11:30.249
to capture people
without killing them.

01:11:30.319 --> 01:11:31.718
It was intended to save lives.

01:11:31.787 --> 01:11:33.584
Yeah,
hell of a job, Doc.

01:11:35.457 --> 01:11:37.118
He got out.

01:11:37.192 --> 01:11:39.422
Yeah, the door was open
when Nina and I got here.

01:11:41.463 --> 01:11:42.452
Why aren't we all sick?

01:11:42.531 --> 01:11:44.465
Some people have
a natural immunity

01:11:44.533 --> 01:11:45.500
to specific viruses.

01:11:45.567 --> 01:11:47.831
Lucky us.

01:11:47.903 --> 01:11:49.598
But from what l
understand,

01:11:49.672 --> 01:11:51.367
once bitten,
there's no protection.

01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:53.271
Whatever, man.
Where's the back door?

01:11:53.342 --> 01:11:54.502
There isn't one.

01:11:54.576 --> 01:11:55.770
[distant growling]

01:12:05.988 --> 01:12:07.421
Oh, shit.

01:12:19.068 --> 01:12:20.501
Stay here.

01:12:24.073 --> 01:12:25.040
You back?

01:12:25.107 --> 01:12:27.200
I'm not going to
die down here,

01:12:27.276 --> 01:12:31.406
but you,
you knew about this.

01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:33.004
No, I didn't know.
I swear.

01:12:33.082 --> 01:12:36.245
Nina, Nina, no.
He's not worth it.

01:12:42.024 --> 01:12:43.389
He's smarter than the others.

01:12:46.562 --> 01:12:47.995
Don't believe this shit.

01:12:48.063 --> 01:12:50.759
I'm not going back
into that airshaft.

01:12:50.833 --> 01:12:52.391
Raah!

01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:00.301
Shut up, bitch.

01:13:02.144 --> 01:13:04.203
Hey, did you guys get him?

01:13:04.279 --> 01:13:05.371
He's in the ventilation system.

01:13:05.447 --> 01:13:07.142
Yeah, I got his little girlfriend, though.

01:13:07.216 --> 01:13:09.707
[clanking, groaning]

01:13:14.123 --> 01:13:15.613
That's Dr. Engel.

01:13:15.691 --> 01:13:17.386
He was the best man
on the team.

01:13:17.459 --> 01:13:20.360
If they do retain
something of what they were,

01:13:20.429 --> 01:13:23.227
we are so screwed.

01:13:23.298 --> 01:13:24.856
We have to find a way out.

01:13:24.933 --> 01:13:25.991
That's the only way out.

01:13:26.068 --> 01:13:27.330
That's why
we chose this place.

01:13:27.403 --> 01:13:29.394
Man, I thought scientists
were supposed to be smart.

01:13:29.471 --> 01:13:31.905
Here, follow me.

01:13:31.974 --> 01:13:32.998
Dumb asshole.

01:13:33.075 --> 01:13:34.508
This place
is a Nike site, right?

01:13:34.576 --> 01:13:35.804
Yeah.

01:13:35.878 --> 01:13:37.778
Well, they weren't making
sneakers up in here.

01:13:37.846 --> 01:13:40.246
Nike sites were built
during the Cold War

01:13:40.315 --> 01:13:42.249
to house missiles.

01:13:42.317 --> 01:13:43.682
What?

01:13:43.752 --> 01:13:46.846
What, you were smoking weed
during history class?

01:13:46.922 --> 01:13:51.222
Anyways, there were missiles,
and there had to be missile silos.

01:13:51.293 --> 01:13:55.024
We find one of those,
and we'll have our escape route.

01:13:58.233 --> 01:14:01.532
Hey, what happened
to Fuck-Face?

01:14:01.603 --> 01:14:03.400
[gasps]

01:14:03.472 --> 01:14:05.099
Oh, Jesus.

01:14:05.174 --> 01:14:07.836
[groaning]

01:14:09.278 --> 01:14:11.746
We have to find
that silo.

01:14:31.900 --> 01:14:34.130
It's going to take forever
to search all these hallways.

01:14:34.203 --> 01:14:36.103
We've got to split up.

01:14:36.171 --> 01:14:38.264
We meet back here
in five minutes.

01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:41.207
Why do white people
always want to split up?

01:14:41.276 --> 01:14:42.504
I'm not doing it.

01:14:42.578 --> 01:14:44.773
He's right.

01:14:44.847 --> 01:14:46.508
Whatever. It's y'all's funeral.
Who is going with who?

01:14:46.582 --> 01:14:47.514
Trevor, you're gonna
go with me.

01:14:47.583 --> 01:14:50.916
No. Trevor and l
stick together.

01:14:50.986 --> 01:14:53.147
We'll be okay.

01:14:53.222 --> 01:14:54.951
All right. Five minutes.

01:14:55.023 --> 01:14:56.149
Not a second longer.

01:14:56.225 --> 01:14:58.159
Be careful.

01:15:06.902 --> 01:15:08.335
You look hot.

01:15:09.771 --> 01:15:12.535
Shut the fuck up.

01:15:20.349 --> 01:15:23.876
Lucky somebody paid attention
during history class.

01:15:23.952 --> 01:15:26.648
Yeah, you're not
as dumb as you look.

01:15:26.722 --> 01:15:28.280
Oh, yeah?

01:15:28.357 --> 01:15:31.155
Well, you're not
as annoying as you look.

01:15:38.834 --> 01:15:41.029
Just in case.

01:16:11.466 --> 01:16:14.367
Go!

01:16:14.436 --> 01:16:17.200
Sarah, run!

01:16:28.517 --> 01:16:31.816
[Salazar screams]

01:16:38.293 --> 01:16:39.419
Are you all right?

01:16:39.494 --> 01:16:42.190
Yeah. Salazar?

01:16:43.899 --> 01:16:45.423
Great.

01:16:47.402 --> 01:16:49.063
Holy shit.
What?

01:16:49.137 --> 01:16:51.105
It's missile propulsion tanks.

01:16:51.173 --> 01:16:52.197
Are you sure?

01:16:52.274 --> 01:16:53.536
Yeah.

01:16:53.609 --> 01:16:55.975
We can rig these
like giant flamethrowers,

01:16:56.044 --> 01:16:57.477
get all those things
in one place,

01:16:57.546 --> 01:16:59.377
and just blast
the shit out of them.

01:16:59.448 --> 01:17:00.847
All right.

01:17:00.916 --> 01:17:04.374
As soon as Nina knocks
the nozzles off the tanks,

01:17:04.453 --> 01:17:07.911
all I have to do is--

01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:14.054
Are you all right?

01:17:14.129 --> 01:17:15.118
It's fine.

01:17:23.305 --> 01:17:25.569
All right, I'm going
to be running like hell.

01:17:25.641 --> 01:17:27.939
As soon as I clear,
you fire the tanks, okay?

01:17:28.010 --> 01:17:29.136
Got it.

01:17:29.211 --> 01:17:30.473
And don't worry,
it's going to work.

01:17:30.545 --> 01:17:33.343
I know.

01:17:33.415 --> 01:17:34.347
Hey, Sarah?

01:17:34.416 --> 01:17:36.111
Yeah?

01:17:36.184 --> 01:17:37.446
Don't get eaten.

01:17:58.940 --> 01:18:01.101
[growling]

01:18:24.700 --> 01:18:26.327
Hey!

01:18:57.099 --> 01:19:00.159
[screaming]

01:19:46.882 --> 01:19:48.406
Now!

01:20:33.995 --> 01:20:37.431

[Radio]
An update on the outbreak
in Leadville, Colorado.

01:20:56.918 --> 01:20:58.442
We're getting sketchy reports

01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:00.488
that bodies are still being discovered,

01:21:00.555 --> 01:21:03.524
but a spokesman
for the military has assured us

01:21:03.592 --> 01:21:06.356
that the flu-like virus
has been fully contained.

01:21:06.428 --> 01:21:08.293
So while travel to and from the area

01:21:08.363 --> 01:21:10.729
won 't be fully restored
for several days,

01:21:10.799 --> 01:21:13.359
it looks like the danger is over.

01:21:13.435 --> 01:21:17.303
This is Haley Schue reporting
for KDSX, Colorado County.

01:21:17.372 --> 01:21:18.498
Aah!
