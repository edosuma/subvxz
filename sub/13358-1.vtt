00:26.987 --> 00:29.321
No. No, I'm at my
fiancee's house right now.

00:29.423 --> 00:31.023
Have him call me at
my apartment tonight.

00:33.493 --> 00:36.494
Okay, well, then we'll have to postpone
until halpern has documentation

00:36.597 --> 00:40.565
to justify these corporate deductions.
Exactly.

00:40.667 --> 00:41.844
And, Carla, make sure you
bill them for this phone call.

00:41.868 --> 00:44.681
I am all packed.
We'll go as soon as Peter's off his call.

00:44.705 --> 00:47.211
Yeah, okay, look, I'm gonna be
in the office in about an hour.

00:47.212 --> 00:49.941
- We'll deal with this then. Okay.
- Awesome!

00:50.043 --> 00:52.911
I'm gonna go get my suitcase.
Vegas, baby!

00:53.013 --> 00:54.779
Vegas, baby.

00:54.881 --> 00:57.927
See, I just... I don't understand
why you go to Vegas, of all places.

00:57.951 --> 00:59.217
Jordan, you could have

00:59.319 --> 01:01.720
a perfectly awesome bachelorette
party right here in town.

01:01.822 --> 01:04.066
I'm the first one to get married,
and the girls want to send me off right.

01:04.090 --> 01:05.790
Yeah, I'll bet they do.

01:05.892 --> 01:07.792
Listen...

01:07.894 --> 01:10.695
- You're not going to drink, are you?
- Do I ever?

01:10.797 --> 01:15.667
Peter, this is me we're talking
about here, boring, predictable me.

01:15.769 --> 01:17.669
I have the weekend
planned out to the minute.

01:17.771 --> 01:20.476
There's no room for shenanigans.
I promise.

01:20.511 --> 01:23.182
- What a pair we make.
- Yes, we do.

01:24.511 --> 01:26.111
Hey, Jordan?

01:30.017 --> 01:31.594
Listen, why don't you leave
the ring with me?

01:31.618 --> 01:34.185
- Why?
- It was my grandmother's.

01:34.288 --> 01:36.521
- It has very sentimental value.
- You don't trust me?

01:36.623 --> 01:41.159
No, it's not you, it's all those
vagrants and addict gamblers in Vegas.

01:41.261 --> 01:43.928
- Take care of it for me.
- I will.

01:44.031 --> 01:45.563
This beautiful ring will be in my safe,

01:45.666 --> 01:47.399
awaiting the return of
my beautiful fiancee.

01:47.501 --> 01:52.337
- Let's go to Vegas.
- Let's go to Vegas.

02:11.725 --> 02:12.824
That looks disgusting.

02:12.926 --> 02:16.394
Jordy, this is your big night,
your last hurrah, so to speak.

02:16.496 --> 02:20.699
I like being in control.
It suits me. Plus I promised Peter.

02:20.801 --> 02:24.769
Jordy... You know we love you.

02:24.871 --> 02:27.450
So we say this with nothing
but your best interests at heart.

02:27.474 --> 02:31.609
As your friends, we're concerned
Peter just isn't the one for you.

02:31.712 --> 02:33.523
- Subtle, Jess.
- Sorry, I couldn't help myself.

02:33.547 --> 02:35.980
I know you guys aren't
big fans of Peter's,

02:36.083 --> 02:37.563
but he's just been really stressed out

02:37.617 --> 02:39.351
and I'm trying to make
things easier on him.

02:39.453 --> 02:41.197
He'll go back to normal
once he gets this promotion.

02:41.221 --> 02:43.388
Okay, if you say so.

02:43.490 --> 02:45.724
- Drinks, ladies?
- Yes!

02:45.826 --> 02:47.292
Can I have a pina colada?

02:47.394 --> 02:49.728
Oh, I'll have the same.
Virgin, please, no rum.

02:49.830 --> 02:51.830
Wh... what?

02:51.932 --> 02:53.412
You guys remember the Winter Formal.

02:53.467 --> 02:56.434
The last time Jordan was truly fun.

02:56.536 --> 02:58.370
I ended up on the back of a motorcycle

02:58.472 --> 03:00.438
30 miles away with a guy
named "snake breath".

03:00.540 --> 03:02.340
And you lost my favorite shoes.

03:02.442 --> 03:05.777
Which is why I am not drinking.
Virgin, definitely.

03:05.879 --> 03:08.480
I will have another
one of these, please.

03:08.582 --> 03:11.049
The best thing about being single,
nobody cares what I do.

03:12.219 --> 03:13.885
And I will take her rum in my pina,

03:13.987 --> 03:16.588
and then a little extra
on top of that, please.

03:16.690 --> 03:17.856
Okay.

03:17.958 --> 03:20.859
And did you want the pint or the yard?

03:20.961 --> 03:22.038
We want the biggest you got.

03:22.260 --> 03:24.127
We are celebrating.

03:25.132 --> 03:26.831
Well, some of us are.

03:26.933 --> 03:29.801
I promise to let loose
as much as humanly possible.

03:29.903 --> 03:32.904
You never know.

03:33.006 --> 03:34.572
My gosh. My gosh, my gosh.

03:34.674 --> 03:36.341
- What?
- Matt Swift.

03:36.443 --> 03:37.308
The Matt Swift?

03:37.411 --> 03:39.310
The movie star.

03:39.413 --> 03:42.213
Wow, it's Matt Swift.

03:42.315 --> 03:44.516
- I lovehim.
- I love him.

03:44.618 --> 03:46.396
- I don't like his movies.
- Who cares about his movies?

03:46.420 --> 03:49.988
He's gorgeous, he's famous, and he's
five feet away, and I am freaking out.

03:50.090 --> 03:51.234
I can't turn around.

03:51.258 --> 03:55.860
He's kind of short.

03:55.962 --> 04:01.466
All right, two straws, virgin, and
one straw, extra super lots of rum.

04:01.568 --> 04:02.612
- Is he looking over here?
- My...

04:02.636 --> 04:04.202
We need to make him look this way.

04:04.304 --> 04:05.837
- He is gorgeous.
- My... he's so hot.

04:07.541 --> 04:09.140
- Hello.
- Yes!

04:09.242 --> 04:10.842
Wow, girl.

04:10.944 --> 04:14.913
- And, um... Virgin.
- Thank you.

04:15.015 --> 04:19.083
- And extra super lots of rum.
- Whoo, yeah!

04:19.185 --> 04:20.918
No, we should cheers Matt.

04:21.021 --> 04:23.121
- Matt!
- Matt!

04:24.991 --> 04:28.232
He cheers-ed back. Cheers.

04:33.433 --> 04:36.067
This is delicious. Cheers, ladies.

04:36.169 --> 04:38.815
You think that's delicious? You
should try the one with the rum in it.

04:42.676 --> 04:44.843
So anyway...

04:44.945 --> 04:47.545
so, all of a sudden,
there's a knock at the door,

04:47.647 --> 04:49.327
and I open the door,
and I said "hello... "

05:15.208 --> 05:19.911
My head's gonna explode.

05:20.847 --> 05:23.081
I have some aspirin if you need it.

05:23.183 --> 05:25.984
Um, hello?

05:26.086 --> 05:27.584
Hi.

05:30.857 --> 05:33.057
Headache?

05:33.159 --> 05:36.294
- I'm Matt. We met last night.
- I know who you are.

05:36.396 --> 05:39.531
Last night a little hazy?

05:39.633 --> 05:44.002
I'm... I mean...

05:44.445 --> 05:47.705
- You're Matt Swift.
- I am.

05:47.807 --> 05:52.977
And I'm here with you
in your hotel room.

05:53.079 --> 05:56.614
- Yes.
- Right.

05:56.716 --> 06:00.985
Well, you and your wonderful mask

06:01.087 --> 06:03.054
couldn't remember your room number,
let alone walk back to it.

06:03.156 --> 06:05.790
So I slept here...

06:05.892 --> 06:08.660
On this couch.

06:08.762 --> 06:09.894
Yeah.

06:09.996 --> 06:12.363
And I slept in the next room, in my bed.

06:16.136 --> 06:19.337
- Where are my friends?
- Your friends.

06:19.439 --> 06:21.217
They went with my manager
Eric, to go celebrate.

06:21.241 --> 06:23.775
- Celebrate what?
- Let me help you.

06:23.877 --> 06:27.011
- Celebrate the wedding.
- Without me?

06:27.113 --> 06:29.647
And they just... they...
they... they just...

06:29.749 --> 06:33.718
Left me here with a stranger?

06:33.820 --> 06:37.622
Wh... stranger?
I'm a pretty respectable guy.

06:43.029 --> 06:44.896
Don't panic.

06:44.998 --> 06:49.867
Everything has an explanation.

06:52.572 --> 06:58.576
Please tell me this is a dream.
It's a dream, right?

06:58.678 --> 07:02.880
'Cause if it's not a dream,
then I have just stolen

07:02.983 --> 07:08.152
somebody's really
humongous, gorgeous diamond.

07:10.190 --> 07:11.536
Room service.

07:14.127 --> 07:18.229
Nice.

07:18.331 --> 07:20.898
All right. You like pancakes?

07:21.001 --> 07:23.635
- Can we talk about last night?
- Amazing, right?

07:24.818 --> 07:27.705
Thank you, my friend.
Amazing?

07:27.807 --> 07:30.575
Yeah, and, you know, I'm shooting
this super stressful movie right now,

07:30.677 --> 07:32.288
so I really needed to
blow off some steam.

07:32.312 --> 07:33.611
Thank you for that.

07:33.713 --> 07:35.613
We were on stage with
a Journey cover band.

07:35.715 --> 07:37.915
Journey is my absolute favorite.

07:38.018 --> 07:40.251
I know, I know. That's
how you got me on stage.

07:40.353 --> 07:42.654
You were really going
for the high notes.

07:42.756 --> 07:45.523
- And then what happened?
- Well, you don't remember.

07:45.625 --> 07:48.926
You won me $6,000 at the craps table.
It was so great.

07:49.029 --> 07:50.306
Every time you'd go to roll the dice...

07:50.330 --> 07:51.941
Okay, you're welcome.
Then what happened?

07:51.965 --> 07:53.364
We went to that new club,

07:53.466 --> 07:56.012
the one where all the waiters, they
wear the outfits made out of tinfoil.

07:56.036 --> 07:58.169
That sounds really weird. What else?

07:58.271 --> 08:02.340
And then we got married.

08:02.442 --> 08:03.741
All right, let's eat.

08:03.843 --> 08:06.344
No.

08:06.446 --> 08:12.617
I mean, I kind of thought that...
no, this is really, really, really bad.

08:12.719 --> 08:18.690
- Is it legal?
- It sure was, wife.

08:18.792 --> 08:21.793
Why do I feel so
horrible? I didn't drink.

08:21.895 --> 08:24.462
I don't...

08:24.564 --> 08:28.166
She must have switched our drinks.

08:28.268 --> 08:30.668
One straw was rum. I got the rum!

08:30.770 --> 08:32.970
Look, I really think
you're just overreacting.

08:33.073 --> 08:36.041
Do you now? Really?
Do you know why I was in town?

08:36.109 --> 08:37.341
It's my bachelorette party.

08:37.443 --> 08:39.744
The bachelorette...

08:39.846 --> 08:42.145
wait, you... Are the bride?

08:42.248 --> 08:44.582
I didn't tell you that last night?

08:44.684 --> 08:47.885
No, you just kept saying that
weddings were stressful and overrated,

08:47.987 --> 08:49.765
and that you just wished
you could get it over with,

08:49.789 --> 08:50.955
which, technically, we did.

08:51.057 --> 08:53.558
- This is so bad.
- Come on.

08:53.660 --> 08:54.959
Let's eat. Come on.

08:55.061 --> 08:56.494
I'm gonna call the lawyers.

08:56.596 --> 08:58.262
Tomorrow, we're gonna get an annulment.

08:58.364 --> 09:01.165
Boom, two days from now,
we are both gonna be single again.

09:01.267 --> 09:02.366
- Really?
- Yes. Sit.

09:02.469 --> 09:03.534
It's that easy?

09:03.636 --> 09:05.937
I pay a lot of money
for these lawyers.

09:06.039 --> 09:07.839
Eat. You will feel better.

09:07.941 --> 09:11.976
Eat.

09:22.322 --> 09:25.056
Good morning, Julie.

09:25.158 --> 09:28.159
Do you remember me?
Eric, Matt's manager?

09:28.261 --> 09:29.371
Sure. Sort of, a little bit,

09:29.395 --> 09:30.806
- but not really at all.
- Can I help you?

09:30.830 --> 09:31.863
You look a little lost.

09:31.965 --> 09:33.698
I lost my key and forgot
my room number.

09:33.800 --> 09:35.666
We having some regrets, Julie?

09:35.769 --> 09:38.703
Yes, thousands. You
promise I'll hear from him?

09:38.805 --> 09:39.805
I promise.

09:39.906 --> 09:41.339
- And what if I don't?
- You will.

09:41.441 --> 09:42.940
- But what if I don't?
- But you will.

09:43.042 --> 09:44.253
But I don't know either of you.

09:44.277 --> 09:45.721
I don't know if you're
telling me the truth.

09:45.745 --> 09:47.645
All right, look, here is my card.

09:47.747 --> 09:48.824
If you need anything,
just give me a call.

09:48.848 --> 09:50.281
You got nothing to worry about.

09:50.383 --> 09:52.683
We're gonna take care of this.
We got it covered, trust me.

09:52.786 --> 09:56.954
And, by the way, for the
annulment and everything,

09:57.056 --> 09:59.991
my name is Jordan. Jordan Grady.

10:00.093 --> 10:01.093
Jordan. Got it.

10:01.997 --> 10:03.730
The toughest cops in the city...

10:03.832 --> 10:06.966
- ... to clean up the mean streets.
- Freeze.

10:07.069 --> 10:10.403
- This guy wasn't one of them.
- Freeze!

10:10.505 --> 10:13.640
From the comedy team that makes
the movies that make you laugh

10:13.742 --> 10:15.875
comes the story of one man's fight

10:15.977 --> 10:17.544
- for truth, justice...
- Freeze!

10:17.646 --> 10:20.380
- And pastrami.
- Freeze!

10:20.482 --> 10:25.885
<i>Matt Swift is Mike storm: Rookie cop.</i>

10:25.987 --> 10:28.354
What have I done?

10:28.457 --> 10:29.701
Of course I have
photographic evidence.

10:29.725 --> 10:31.791
I'm not an idiot.

10:31.893 --> 10:34.060
That's what you're offering?

10:34.162 --> 10:36.963
Daily Gossip offered three times that.

10:37.065 --> 10:38.743
Well, I'm sorry we couldn't
do business together.

10:38.767 --> 10:40.567
Wait, wait, hang on, hang on.

10:40.669 --> 10:43.403
- What's that?
- $25,000.

10:43.505 --> 10:47.207
That is a number I can work with.

10:50.145 --> 10:53.480
Wait, wait, turn it off, turn it off.

10:53.582 --> 10:55.248
No, you two have
some explaining to do.

10:57.986 --> 11:02.756
Okay, okay, can you guys
please tell me... what is this?

11:04.826 --> 11:07.026
That's your list of things
to do while in Vegas.

11:07.129 --> 11:10.430
And do you see anywhere
on this list where it says

11:10.532 --> 11:13.666
"marry someone who is not your fiance"?

11:13.769 --> 11:15.702
Yeah, I don't see that on there.

11:15.804 --> 11:22.342
Jordan, you are Mrs. Matt Swift.
That is huge. That is super huge.

11:22.444 --> 11:24.088
He wouldn't even marry
that chick from that sitcom

11:24.112 --> 11:25.945
that he dated for,
like, five years, so...

11:27.082 --> 11:29.315
It's Peter.

11:29.417 --> 11:31.028
- What are you gonna tell him?
- Nothing! Nothing.

11:31.052 --> 11:33.319
Matt said that we could
get a quickie annulment,

11:33.421 --> 11:34.499
and it could be over in,
like, one to two days.

11:34.523 --> 11:40.093
So... Peter will not understand.
We take this to the grave.

11:40.195 --> 11:41.528
- To the grave.
- Okay.

11:41.630 --> 11:43.129
I promise.

11:43.231 --> 11:46.099
Hi, sweetie, how are you?

11:46.201 --> 11:48.479
Good, you're awake.
Didn't want you to miss your flight.

11:48.503 --> 11:51.838
That is so sweet. You
always think of me, honey.

11:51.940 --> 11:55.229
I'm heading into the office for a little
before picking you girls up.

11:55.310 --> 11:57.755
You know, you work too hard.
You should give yourself a break.

11:57.779 --> 12:01.214
Idle hands don't make partner
by summer. Billable hours do.

12:01.316 --> 12:03.883
You're right. I understand, honey.

12:03.985 --> 12:11.658
So is last night's wedding the biggest
mistake of her life, or is this one?

12:18.633 --> 12:22.268
There he is. All right.

12:22.370 --> 12:25.538
Hey.

12:26.765 --> 12:29.209
There's my bride. How you doing, honey?

12:29.311 --> 12:30.977
Great.

12:31.079 --> 12:36.082
And... I kept it safe for you.

12:36.184 --> 12:40.787
Thank you. Felt so weird without it,
like something was missing.

12:41.837 --> 12:45.558
Betty, Wilma, you two
look worse for the wear.

12:45.660 --> 12:47.905
Now, if you didn't drink, like Jordy,
you'd be feeling much better today.

12:47.929 --> 12:51.965
Yeah, Jordy's way
better off than us today.

12:56.738 --> 13:00.807
- So how was the bachelor bash?
- Terrible.

13:00.909 --> 13:03.343
I drank two beers and
triple-bogeyed every hole.

13:03.445 --> 13:05.523
Just can't think straight
under the influence, you know?

13:05.547 --> 13:08.948
- Really ruined my day.
- I know how you feel.

13:11.253 --> 13:15.655
So we can put the Martins
at table 11 with the Busbys,

13:15.757 --> 13:17.657
or the Buzzkills, as
I like to call them.

13:17.759 --> 13:19.759
What do you think, sweetie?

13:19.861 --> 13:23.162
- What, mom?
- Aren't you paying attention?

13:23.265 --> 13:28.468
This is your wedding.
I'm not doing this because I enjoy it.

13:28.570 --> 13:31.538
I just can't seat people I don't know.
It doesn't feel right.

13:31.967 --> 13:33.473
Don't mind her.

13:33.575 --> 13:36.409
She's still tired and cranky
from her little bachelorette bash.

13:36.511 --> 13:37.956
I keep saying that Vegas
is one disgusting town.

13:37.980 --> 13:41.247
You know, I've never understood
the draw of gambling.

13:41.350 --> 13:42.882
It seems ridiculous to throw your money

13:42.985 --> 13:44.718
at something with such
a low rate of return.

13:44.820 --> 13:47.220
It's the thrill,

13:47.322 --> 13:48.962
the challenge of trying
to beat the house.

13:50.792 --> 13:52.659
Are you feeling okay?

13:52.761 --> 13:55.962
I certainly hope that you are
not coming down with something.

13:56.064 --> 13:58.999
I'm fine. Just a little tired.

13:59.101 --> 14:01.101
Get over it, darling.

14:01.203 --> 14:04.337
Weddings don't plan themselves.

14:09.378 --> 14:12.178
Why hasn't he called?
It's been two days.

14:12.280 --> 14:14.681
It's been one day.

14:14.783 --> 14:16.383
- It feels like ten.
- He'll call.

14:16.485 --> 14:17.829
- How do you know?
- I'm very psychic.

14:17.853 --> 14:19.519
No, you're not.

14:19.621 --> 14:22.349
Look, he's married too.
It's not just you.

14:22.384 --> 14:23.323
Though I find it highly unfair

14:23.425 --> 14:26.326
that Jess and I can't find one husband,
and at the present time, you have two.

14:26.428 --> 14:29.896
Don't envy me. I am a very bad person,
who can't own up to my own mistakes.

14:29.998 --> 14:31.709
I'm having a very hard
time living with myself.

14:31.733 --> 14:36.002
- You can always come clean.
- Not that hard a time.

14:36.104 --> 14:38.972
- These aren't the right size.
- They were cute.

14:39.074 --> 14:40.774
These are the big size.

14:40.876 --> 14:42.453
We have to have the small size
with these tins.

14:42.477 --> 14:45.612
They bubble.

14:45.714 --> 14:48.915
Good morning. Hi, Benny.

15:15.744 --> 15:16.744
- Hello?
- Hey, Jordy.

15:16.845 --> 15:21.681
- Alan's on his way in.
- Thank you.

15:21.783 --> 15:25.953
- The Welby House has closed.
- That was so quick.

15:26.054 --> 15:28.621
You're doing a good job, Jordan.
It's not going unnoticed.

15:28.724 --> 15:32.892
Thank you, Alan.

15:33.427 --> 15:35.591
- Is that your fiance?
- Where?

15:35.626 --> 15:38.529
- He's still your fiance?
- Yes, of course.

15:41.670 --> 15:42.714
Hi, sweetie. What a nice surprise.

15:42.738 --> 15:46.339
- Hey, Peter.
- Hi.

15:50.579 --> 15:51.579
I can explain.

15:53.750 --> 15:57.296
So Vegas was so uneventful
that you simply forgot to mention this?

15:57.320 --> 15:59.832
I'm so sorry.
It was really just a big misunderstanding

15:59.856 --> 16:02.023
that spiraled out of
control, and I am fixing it.

16:02.125 --> 16:06.472
The foundation of a solid relationship is
trust, and you go and pull a stunt like this?

16:06.496 --> 16:08.429
Peter, I am so sorry.
You have to know that.

16:08.531 --> 16:09.875
And you said you wouldn't drink, Jordan.

16:09.899 --> 16:13.067
And I didn't. I mean, I tried not to.

16:13.169 --> 16:16.337
But what?
You were force-fed by Jose Cuervo?

16:16.439 --> 16:20.174
Peter, there was a mix-up.
I accidentally got Claire's drink,

16:20.276 --> 16:22.087
and then, the next thing
I knew, we were married.

16:22.111 --> 16:24.879
I knew you would react like this, which
is why I wanted to handle it first.

16:24.981 --> 16:26.247
Of course I react like this.

16:26.349 --> 16:27.460
What, were you
looking for my blessing?

16:27.484 --> 16:30.618
Peter, nothing happened.

16:30.720 --> 16:33.387
No, a marriage happened, Jordan.
That's not nothing.

16:33.490 --> 16:38.759
It was an innocent, yet
severe lapse of judgment,

16:38.862 --> 16:42.330
and I promise it will
not ever happen again.

16:42.432 --> 16:45.878
And how does all this not interfere
with our impending nuptials?

16:45.902 --> 16:49.337
- Matt's taking care of it.
- Matt's taking care of it.

16:49.439 --> 16:50.538
So he's "Matt" to you now.

16:50.640 --> 16:54.208
Listen, we are going
to get an annulment,

16:54.310 --> 16:57.945
and then we can just pretend
like none of this ever happened.

16:58.047 --> 16:58.946
When?

16:59.048 --> 17:00.781
As soon as his lawyers call me.

17:00.884 --> 17:04.685
And then I am going to marry you,

17:04.787 --> 17:08.890
and we are going to have
a great life together.

17:08.992 --> 17:14.262
Stuff to bring on honeymoon...

17:14.364 --> 17:18.499
Okay.

17:22.505 --> 17:25.272
I am not giving any interviews.
No comment.

17:25.375 --> 17:26.674
That's good, that's good.

17:26.776 --> 17:28.787
They're gonna keep calling you.
Just keep saying that.

17:28.811 --> 17:30.478
- You have no comment.
- Who is this?

17:30.580 --> 17:32.880
It's Matt.

17:32.982 --> 17:35.550
Please tell me you're calling
to say we have our annulment.

17:35.652 --> 17:37.586
No, not yet, but we should know
something in the next few days.

17:37.620 --> 17:39.687
Time is of the essence here, Matt.

17:39.789 --> 17:42.034
I know, I know, and Eric's
informed the attorneys of that.

17:42.058 --> 17:45.126
Look, Jordan, I'm sorry you
got dragged into my madness.

17:45.228 --> 17:47.706
I can't blow my nose these days
without it making it into the tabloids.

17:47.730 --> 17:50.398
Who did this? Who
gave them that picture?

17:50.500 --> 17:52.633
Could have been anyone.

17:52.735 --> 17:55.080
Room service guy, the chapel
people, a cab driver... anyone.

17:55.104 --> 17:56.482
People are always looking
to make a quick buck.

17:56.506 --> 17:57.872
At our expense.

17:57.974 --> 18:00.241
Look, we're gonna get this
taken care of. We'll get it done.

18:00.343 --> 18:05.780
As soon as possible, please.
My fiance is not happy.

18:09.419 --> 18:10.618
Who wants some moo shu?

18:10.720 --> 18:13.754
I'll trade you for
sweet and sour chicken.

18:13.856 --> 18:15.834
- Do you have any chopsticks?
- In the utensil drawer.

18:15.858 --> 18:19.894
I should've brought
them from my apartment.

18:19.996 --> 18:22.330
- He's so moody.
- You would be too

18:22.432 --> 18:23.475
if your fiancee married
someone who wasn't you.

18:23.499 --> 18:25.533
I blame you.

18:25.635 --> 18:28.035
Well, I blame you too,
for my predicament.

18:28.137 --> 18:31.005
Boo-hoo, poor you.
I married a movie star.

18:31.107 --> 18:32.818
My husband's the hottest
guy in the universe.

18:32.842 --> 18:34.542
Turn the oven on, I am so going in.

18:34.644 --> 18:38.257
I didn't want this, all right?
I don't even think he's a good actor.

18:38.281 --> 18:39.480
Then can I have him?

18:39.582 --> 18:43.384
- You don't have chopsticks.
- I'm sorry, I thought I did.

18:43.486 --> 18:46.954
It's no problem.
Let's just put in the movie.

18:47.056 --> 18:50.725
I hear it's funny.

18:50.827 --> 18:53.661
And we all could use a little
bit of a laugh right now.

18:53.763 --> 18:56.864
<i>...mystery wife of
movie star Matt Swift.</i>

18:56.966 --> 19:00.001
<i>Hollywood has learned exclusively</i>

19:00.103 --> 19:02.637
<i>that the bride, Jordan Grady,
works as a real estate agent...</i>

19:02.739 --> 19:04.705
<i>For Pratt brothers realty.</i>

19:04.807 --> 19:07.808
<i>Not only was this marriage
kept well under wraps,</i>

19:07.910 --> 19:10.211
<i>but evidently Ms. Grady
was scheduled to marry</i>

19:10.313 --> 19:14.315
<i>this man, attorney Peter Drake,
in just a few weeks.</i>

19:14.417 --> 19:17.685
While this top secret wedding seemed
to catch all of Hollywood off guard,

19:17.787 --> 19:20.888
no one seems to be more
surprised than Lauren Deblanc.

19:20.990 --> 19:23.391
I've always said that
Matthew is a narcissist

19:23.493 --> 19:26.761
that suffers from a severe
case of arrested development,

19:26.863 --> 19:31.265
and unless one can marry oneself,
he would never tie the knot.

19:31.367 --> 19:33.868
But color me in the wrong.

19:33.970 --> 19:37.271
Go ahead and do it, because how silly!

19:37.373 --> 19:41.008
He just up and married some
random gold digger he just met.

19:41.110 --> 19:44.111
Jordan.

19:44.213 --> 19:47.882
Undoubtedly, we have not heard
the last of Jordan Grady.

19:51.487 --> 19:54.755
You just went from anonymous
to notorious in, like, 15 flat.

19:54.857 --> 20:00.405
Yeah, that was a great laugh.
I need to... I need to get some air.

20:11.808 --> 20:14.475
- Hello.
- Come, come on.

20:14.577 --> 20:17.645
So here's the latest report
from Studio Marketing.

20:17.747 --> 20:20.347
<i>- Rookie cop.
- Oh, thanks.</i>

20:20.450 --> 20:22.516
Okay. Well, it's tracking better.

20:22.618 --> 20:26.353
Wow... Much better.

20:26.456 --> 20:27.855
Your plan is working.

20:27.957 --> 20:32.626
Scandal broke two days ago, and
interest in the movie's up 240% already.

20:32.729 --> 20:35.596
- Wow, that's a lot of percent.
- It is.

20:35.698 --> 20:39.667
Matt is going to be on the cover
of People Magazine next week.

20:39.769 --> 20:42.903
Yay! Quest P.R. called this morning.

20:43.005 --> 20:45.005
His wife too.

20:45.108 --> 20:47.708
This whole thing has made
Matt Swift quite intriguing.

20:47.810 --> 20:49.276
Yay, I love that.

20:50.947 --> 20:52.513
Burt Feedler called this morning,

20:52.615 --> 20:56.617
and he is ready to go
through with the annulment.

20:56.719 --> 20:58.919
He just needs a little
bit more information, so...

20:59.021 --> 21:02.590
You know what? Let's hold off.

21:02.692 --> 21:06.093
Let it ride for a little while,
at least until the movie opens.

21:06.195 --> 21:07.394
Should I let Matt know?

21:07.497 --> 21:09.563
I'll let him know when
I see him on the set later.

21:09.665 --> 21:14.201
- Okay, I will not say a word.
- Why are you whispering?

21:14.303 --> 21:15.536
Halfway there.

21:15.638 --> 21:18.672
Thank you so much for
helping with the place cards.

21:18.775 --> 21:21.809
I just hope it isn't all for nothing.

21:21.911 --> 21:25.246
Passive-aggressive doesn't suit you, mom.
I prefer you aggressive-aggressive.

21:25.348 --> 21:27.882
Fine, then I will be
aggressive-aggressive.

21:27.984 --> 21:30.618
Jordan Elizabeth Grady,
you have no one to blame

21:30.720 --> 21:32.153
for this predicament but yourself.

21:32.255 --> 21:33.587
I don't mean to pry,

21:33.689 --> 21:36.557
but why would you have gone
and done something like this?

21:36.659 --> 21:39.994
I don't know. I guess
I just freaked out.

21:40.096 --> 21:42.341
I mean, things have been so
crazy with the wedding planning,

21:42.365 --> 21:43.497
and Peter was stressed.

21:43.599 --> 21:47.701
I guess I just got
carried away by a moment.

21:47.804 --> 21:50.271
Moments are just that,
sweetie... moments.

21:50.373 --> 21:51.906
Marriage is forever.

21:52.008 --> 21:54.375
So you better make
sure it was just a moment,

21:54.477 --> 21:57.778
and not some sort of... Cry for help.

21:57.880 --> 22:00.447
It was just a moment.
I am positive of that,

22:00.550 --> 22:02.349
and I am doing everything
I can to fix it.

22:02.451 --> 22:04.351
Well, good, or your dad's
going to lose it,

22:04.453 --> 22:08.322
because he's already put down $4,300
in non-refundable deposits.

22:08.424 --> 22:13.627
Okay, please tell daddy not to worry.
This wedding is happening.

22:13.729 --> 22:17.364
I am sure the annulment is
going through as we speak.

22:25.575 --> 22:27.119
All right, come on,
give me your best.

22:27.143 --> 22:28.383
Show me what you got. I'm ready.

22:30.079 --> 22:32.479
- No problem.
- You are out of shape.

22:32.582 --> 22:34.982
Come on, don't blame me
for my avatar's shortcomings?

22:35.084 --> 22:36.984
I'm a phone jockey.
What do you want from me?

22:37.086 --> 22:40.265
Hey, which, by the way, is ringing
off the hook for you, my friend.

22:40.289 --> 22:41.289
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

22:41.357 --> 22:42.467
- New business or old business?
- New.

22:42.491 --> 22:43.691
Quite new.

22:43.793 --> 22:44.793
- Yeah?
- Come on.

22:44.861 --> 22:46.827
Quest P.R. tells me that suddenly.

22:46.929 --> 22:49.530
<i>Rookie cop is 72% interest.</i>

22:49.632 --> 22:52.833
Forget this.

22:52.935 --> 22:54.668
Yeah, yeah, yeah, man,
you're up from 12%.

22:54.770 --> 22:55.636
This is good for you.

22:55.738 --> 22:58.339
Is this 'cause of the marriage?

22:58.441 --> 23:00.774
It most definitely is
because of the marriage.

23:00.877 --> 23:02.910
Go figure, Hollywood.

23:03.012 --> 23:06.947
The only place where bad publicity
suddenly is good for your career.

23:07.049 --> 23:09.450
What are you talking about,
bad publicity? It's just publicity.

23:09.552 --> 23:12.119
And if we hold off on the annulment
until after the movie opens,

23:12.221 --> 23:14.922
we are looking at a very
big weekend, my friend.

23:15.024 --> 23:16.268
She's supposed to
get married really soon.

23:16.292 --> 23:18.893
I'm just talking about
a little while, a matter of days.

23:18.995 --> 23:21.161
She'll have plenty of
time to get married.

23:21.264 --> 23:22.529
Everybody wins here, Matt.

23:22.632 --> 23:25.232
Come on, we need this.

23:25.334 --> 23:29.236
You need this. Your career needs this.

23:29.338 --> 23:30.816
Okay, but the second the movie opens,

23:30.840 --> 23:34.642
- you make this thing happen.
- Done, you got it.

23:36.345 --> 23:38.545
There she is, there she is.

23:38.648 --> 23:39.546
- Got it?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:39.649 --> 23:42.016
No!

23:44.687 --> 23:47.321
- My goodness.
- I was violated.

23:47.423 --> 23:50.457
There's a peeping tom outside,
and he just saw me naked.

23:50.559 --> 23:53.994
- What are you talking about?
- Go look, go look.

23:56.699 --> 23:57.898
They found out where I live.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.668
My gosh, they're probably
going through our trash.

24:00.770 --> 24:01.914
This is insane. It's been two days.

24:01.938 --> 24:03.070
I want my life back.

24:03.172 --> 24:05.139
You call them today
and rail into them...

24:05.241 --> 24:08.375
Okay, don't worry. I will
put a stop to this today.

24:08.477 --> 24:10.945
No, no, no.

24:11.047 --> 24:13.247
You're... shh.

24:13.349 --> 24:17.651
Over here, over here. Hey, Jordy.

24:17.753 --> 24:23.590
I will have you know that this is illegal.
You are trespassing on private property.

24:23.693 --> 24:25.960
Hey, the grass may be
private property,

24:26.062 --> 24:28.195
but the sidewalk lives in
the public domain, toots.

24:28.297 --> 24:30.164
Okay, well, my fiance's a lawyer.

24:30.266 --> 24:32.166
All right.

24:32.268 --> 24:34.335
Jordy, Jordy, one more shot.

24:34.437 --> 24:36.370
Come on. Hey, roll down
your window, at least!

24:47.412 --> 24:49.516
Eric Spencer's office.

24:49.618 --> 24:51.051
Hi, my name is Jordan Grady...

24:51.153 --> 24:54.521
Hold please.

24:57.326 --> 25:00.227
This is going to need signatures asap.

25:05.835 --> 25:07.134
Eric Spencer's office.

25:07.236 --> 25:08.796
- My name is Jor...
- One moment please.

25:08.838 --> 25:11.705
I'm so sorry. We are just...
the phones are on fire today.

25:15.411 --> 25:16.744
Eric Spencer's office.

25:16.846 --> 25:19.880
Listen, it is imperative
that I speak with Matt Swift.

25:19.982 --> 25:22.694
My name is Jordan Grady, and
I desperately need to talk with him.

25:22.718 --> 25:25.998
Okay, desperate, sounds important.
Hold, please. I have that number.

25:26.022 --> 25:27.432
Oh, hate when that happens.

25:27.456 --> 25:29.957
It's my first day.
I have that number here.

25:30.059 --> 25:33.127
Somewhere... If you could...
my goodness, outsmarted myself.

25:33.229 --> 25:37.031
All righty.
818-555-0124.

25:37.133 --> 25:39.733
Thank you so much.
I really appreciate your help.

25:39.835 --> 25:43.037
Thank you.

25:50.813 --> 25:52.179
Hey, it's Belinda here,

25:52.281 --> 25:55.282
and you've reached the official
Matt Swift fan club line!

25:55.384 --> 25:57.551
If you'd like to join,
leave your name and address

25:57.653 --> 26:00.154
after the tone, and I'll
send you a membership kit.

26:00.256 --> 26:06.293
We can be united forever as soul sisters
in our love for Matt Swift!

26:12.670 --> 26:14.069
I don't know how people do it.

26:14.171 --> 26:15.482
I feel like I'm living in a fish bowl.

26:15.506 --> 26:17.172
I feel like a public spectacle.

26:17.275 --> 26:18.674
Peter is so humiliated.

26:18.776 --> 26:21.510
I can't even look at him.
I'm just racked with guilt.

26:21.612 --> 26:23.479
- Try calling that manager guy.
- I did.

26:23.581 --> 26:25.892
And my autographed picture
will arrive in four to six weeks.

26:25.916 --> 26:27.716
He said he'd take my calls.

26:27.818 --> 26:29.029
Guess what. He's not taking my calls.

26:29.053 --> 26:31.687
- So now what?
- I don't know.

26:31.789 --> 26:35.569
You need to go to the premiere.
Rookie cop is opening tomorrow night.

26:35.593 --> 26:36.903
Vanessa's firm is covering publicity.

26:36.927 --> 26:38.605
- Could she get me in?
- Please, I'm her roommate.

26:38.629 --> 26:39.495
She can't even get me in.

26:39.597 --> 26:41.497
Great plan. Well thought-out.

26:41.599 --> 26:42.599
Just show up.

26:42.700 --> 26:46.201
Talk to him. How hard can it be?

26:54.612 --> 26:58.881
Silly of me to think
this would be difficult.

26:58.983 --> 27:01.216
There he is, there he is. Matt!

27:01.319 --> 27:02.785
- Hey, Matt!
- Matt, Matt, Matt!

27:02.887 --> 27:05.054
- Come here, come here.
- Matt!

27:05.156 --> 27:06.433
- Matt, come here.
- This is a great plan.

27:06.457 --> 27:07.890
Come here. Matt, Matt, come here.

27:07.992 --> 27:10.159
Listen, Matt, Matt... go, just go.

27:10.261 --> 27:11.627
- No.
- Go, go, just go.

27:11.729 --> 27:13.307
There is a barricade
here for a reason, Claire.

27:13.331 --> 27:15.698
As if you can't jump
over a three-foot rope.

27:15.800 --> 27:17.077
I'm gonna distract
the security guard.

27:17.101 --> 27:18.434
You just go. Hey, hey, hey!

27:18.536 --> 27:20.602
Excuse me! Excuse me.
Yeah, you, come on.

27:20.705 --> 27:23.706
Come on. Come here.

27:23.808 --> 27:25.541
Do you work out?

27:25.643 --> 27:27.843
I just love a guy in uniform.

27:27.945 --> 27:29.089
Is that a bulletproof vest under there?

27:29.113 --> 27:31.513
- It is, isn't it?
- No.

27:31.615 --> 27:34.316
Sorry, sorry, excuse me.
I need to talk to Matt.

27:34.418 --> 27:35.584
I know you! You're...

27:35.686 --> 27:36.985
my name is Jordan Grady.

27:37.088 --> 27:38.354
I am Matt's wife.

27:38.456 --> 27:39.933
And I have been trying
to get a hold of you.

27:39.957 --> 27:42.825
Right, right, of course. I...
that's where I've seen you.

27:42.927 --> 27:44.671
Look, I am so sorry I haven't
gotten back in touch with you.

27:44.695 --> 27:46.729
I mean, it has been crazy
with this movie premiere.

27:46.831 --> 27:48.442
Well, it's been a
little crazy for me too,

27:48.466 --> 27:50.226
seeing as how I can't
get my marriage license

27:50.267 --> 27:52.334
for my upcoming wedding
until I'm single...

27:52.436 --> 27:53.869
which will be when exactly?

27:53.971 --> 27:56.705
Yeah, one sec, okay?

27:56.807 --> 27:58.307
Hey, Matt, excuse me. I am so sorry.

27:58.409 --> 28:00.008
Please, come here, just for a second.

28:00.111 --> 28:01.910
Look who's here. Your wifey showed up.

28:02.012 --> 28:03.156
I'd prefer if you
didn't call me that.

28:03.180 --> 28:04.324
- Hey, whoa, guys, guys.
- Excuse me, whoa.

28:04.348 --> 28:05.748
Guys, it's okay. She's with me.

28:05.850 --> 28:08.016
- Okay, okay.
- Sorry about that.

28:08.119 --> 28:10.352
Thank you, I wasn't really
in the mood to go to jail.

28:10.454 --> 28:11.754
Can we please talk?

28:11.856 --> 28:14.823
Yes, I... Need to
take care of this first.

28:14.925 --> 28:17.826
Do you... Do you want to see the movie?

28:17.928 --> 28:20.562
- Then can we talk?
- Definitely, definitely.

28:20.664 --> 28:22.264
Here.

28:31.842 --> 28:36.545
There she goes.

28:36.647 --> 28:37.858
Jordan, I'm sorry I took so long

28:37.882 --> 28:39.081
to get in touch with you.

28:39.183 --> 28:40.849
What's your name?

28:40.951 --> 28:41.817
- Shelly.
- With an "e-y"?

28:41.919 --> 28:43.118
No, just "y".

28:43.220 --> 28:45.788
You didn't get in touch with me.

28:45.890 --> 28:47.256
I stalked you and risked arrest.

28:47.358 --> 28:49.024
Right, and I'm sorry about that.

28:49.126 --> 28:51.293
I've just been so busy
promoting the film.

28:51.395 --> 28:52.915
Shelly, you are as pretty as your name.

28:53.664 --> 28:55.931
We need to talk about
our little problem here.

28:56.033 --> 28:59.067
Wait, can you sign
one for my sister Beth?

28:59.170 --> 29:00.903
How about "to my good friend, Beth"?

29:01.005 --> 29:02.805
She'd like that a really lot.

29:02.907 --> 29:04.873
Peter and I have
done some research,

29:04.975 --> 29:07.743
and apparently getting an
annulment is not as easy

29:07.845 --> 29:08.744
as what you might think.

29:08.846 --> 29:10.612
Eric's got it covered.

29:10.714 --> 29:12.181
You have documents and pie charts.

29:12.283 --> 29:14.750
This is not the same
girl I met in Vegas.

29:14.852 --> 29:15.852
My guard was down.

29:15.953 --> 29:17.653
There you go. Well, maybe you should

29:17.755 --> 29:18.865
let your guard down a little more often.

29:18.889 --> 29:20.489
- It is!
- Look, Matt...

29:20.591 --> 29:22.157
- can we have one?
- Sure, of course.

29:22.259 --> 29:24.259
Thank you so much. My name is Suzie.

29:24.361 --> 29:28.297
There you go, Suzie.

29:28.399 --> 29:30.499
So you gonna see my movie?

29:30.601 --> 29:32.401
Yeah, of course I am.

29:32.503 --> 29:33.936
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

29:34.038 --> 29:36.705
And I wanted to
give this back to you.

29:36.807 --> 29:38.407
Keep it. I bought it for you.

29:38.509 --> 29:40.242
Or you could sell it.

29:40.344 --> 29:42.144
Thank you, but I can't.

29:42.246 --> 29:43.812
It's blood money.

29:43.914 --> 29:47.149
My happy future may have died for it.

29:47.251 --> 29:48.451
What's your favorite charity?

29:48.552 --> 29:51.687
- Cancer society.
- We'll donate it to them.

29:51.789 --> 29:54.823
Really? You'd do that?

29:54.925 --> 29:57.493
If you'll sit back down.

29:57.595 --> 30:00.095
Listen, I feel horrible about this...

30:00.197 --> 30:03.732
Although, it does take two to marry.

30:03.834 --> 30:04.911
I still can't believe we did that.

30:04.935 --> 30:07.469
<i>I can't believe I did that.</i>

30:07.571 --> 30:09.938
Why did you do it? Why'd you marry me?

30:10.040 --> 30:12.374
Well, you know, I've
thought about it a lot,

30:12.476 --> 30:13.916
and I really think it was your smile.

30:14.011 --> 30:16.445
- It hooked me.
- There she is.

30:16.547 --> 30:17.947
There's the girl I know and married,

30:18.048 --> 30:19.381
the no-nonsense smart aleck.

30:19.483 --> 30:20.627
She comes out every once in a while.

30:20.651 --> 30:23.785
Well, keep her coming. I like that girl.

30:23.888 --> 30:26.288
Although you still haven't
answered my question.

30:26.390 --> 30:29.224
Why'd you do it?

30:29.326 --> 30:31.226
Honestly, I think...

30:31.328 --> 30:33.362
All the time, about everything.

30:33.464 --> 30:35.597
My brain never shuts up.

30:35.699 --> 30:38.300
And that night, I just turned it off

30:38.402 --> 30:39.535
and lived in the moment.

30:39.637 --> 30:42.838
Turn it off. Words to live by.

30:42.940 --> 30:45.707
- If only I could.
- You can.

30:45.809 --> 30:50.646
You just choose not to.

30:50.748 --> 30:51.748
Why did you marry me?

30:51.782 --> 30:53.482
Because we had a blast.

30:53.584 --> 30:56.952
My philosophy's always
been look before you leap...

30:57.054 --> 31:00.055
Then look again, ten more times.

31:00.157 --> 31:01.890
My way's more fun than yours.

31:01.992 --> 31:05.594
Well, my way's less
complicated than your way.

31:05.696 --> 31:06.862
You might have a point.

31:06.964 --> 31:09.598
As evidenced by the
endless stream of flashbulbs

31:09.700 --> 31:11.800
- currently bombarding us.
- You know what,

31:11.902 --> 31:12.979
let's get you out of
here before you go blind.

31:13.003 --> 31:14.269
I've got my car at the theater.

31:14.371 --> 31:15.737
I'll give you a ride home.

31:15.839 --> 31:17.150
Eric's taking care of things.
Soon this will be done.

31:17.174 --> 31:18.718
Then you can rush off
and marry hubby number two

31:18.742 --> 31:19.753
and live happily ever after.

31:19.777 --> 31:21.410
Where are you guys staying tonight?

31:21.512 --> 31:23.378
- No comment!
- Atta girl.

31:23.480 --> 31:25.681
Come on, Matt, smile.

31:25.783 --> 31:28.250
Yes!

31:28.352 --> 31:30.786
Initial box office numbers are in.

31:30.888 --> 31:32.888
$8 million on the day,

31:32.990 --> 31:34.456
projecting to a $32 million weekend

31:34.558 --> 31:37.225
and the number one spot.
The studio is pleased.

31:37.328 --> 31:39.895
They are quite pleased.
They're talking sequel already.

31:39.997 --> 31:42.230
This is a fluke. Don't they get it?

31:42.333 --> 31:43.565
A sequel would be ridiculous.

31:43.667 --> 31:46.535
All they care about is
the bottom line, my friend.

31:46.637 --> 31:48.882
And right now, the bottom line
is looking quite appealing.

31:48.906 --> 31:51.306
Great, then let's revisit
that indie movie that I like.

31:51.408 --> 31:53.642
Matt, you can't go
and do $2 million indies

31:53.744 --> 31:54.643
when you're this hot.

31:54.745 --> 31:57.813
They want franchises with you.

31:57.915 --> 31:59.292
I know what I'm talking
about on this, Matt.

31:59.316 --> 32:00.816
- You've got to trust me.
- I know.

32:00.918 --> 32:02.951
I know, I trust you.

32:03.053 --> 32:04.853
This is a big weekend for you.

32:04.955 --> 32:06.588
You won it. Enjoy it.

32:06.690 --> 32:09.458
- You won it!
- At someone else's expense.

32:10.761 --> 32:12.038
Hey, now that the movie's open,

32:12.062 --> 32:13.306
let's make this annulment
thing happen, okay?

32:13.330 --> 32:15.130
You got it, buddy.

32:15.232 --> 32:17.099
I will get Burt on it right away.

32:17.201 --> 32:18.201
- Cool.
- All right.

32:18.268 --> 32:19.379
- You have a good shoot today.
- Great.

32:19.403 --> 32:21.403
- Later.
- Thanks.

32:21.505 --> 32:23.005
Come on, Gibbs.

32:23.107 --> 32:25.607
This isn't a settlement,
this is an insult.

32:25.709 --> 32:26.608
No, i...

32:26.710 --> 32:27.854
when they showed up last night

32:27.878 --> 32:29.378
to the premiere of his new movie...

32:29.480 --> 32:32.147
I'll call you back.

32:32.249 --> 32:35.517
And heartthrob Matt
Swift wasted no time

32:35.619 --> 32:37.185
squiring his new bride around town.

32:37.287 --> 32:41.189
No, listen, our
position remains the same.

32:41.291 --> 32:43.425
We have no comment.

32:43.527 --> 32:46.595
Yeah, and in terms of
those pregnancy rumors...

32:46.697 --> 32:47.896
really?

32:47.998 --> 32:49.309
I thought everyone had heard those.

32:49.333 --> 32:51.044
Yeah, people are calling
me left and right asking me,

32:51.068 --> 32:54.136
but... no, again no comment!

32:57.408 --> 32:58.774
She's pregnant?

32:58.876 --> 33:00.020
I didn't say she was pregnant.

33:00.044 --> 33:02.044
I didn't say she wasn't pregnant.

33:02.146 --> 33:05.480
She very well may
be... Or she may not be.

33:05.582 --> 33:07.482
- Who knows?
- Keeping it fresh in the press.

33:07.584 --> 33:11.186
I don't want a $32
million weekend, Vivienne.

33:11.288 --> 33:15.090
- No.
- I want a $42 million weekend.

33:15.192 --> 33:16.491
- Yes!
- Come on.

33:16.593 --> 33:18.093
- Up top! High five!
- Yes!

33:18.195 --> 33:19.061
- Taste it! Taste it!
- Yes.

33:19.163 --> 33:21.363
- Yes!
- Yes!

33:21.465 --> 33:23.176
All right, all right, come on.
What's next? What've we got?

33:23.200 --> 33:24.733
Let's ratchet it down. All right.

33:24.835 --> 33:28.203
Moving onward and upward...
let me get my pen, sorry.

33:37.548 --> 33:39.526
No, no, no, no, put
that down, put that down.

33:39.550 --> 33:40.749
Let me help you.

33:40.851 --> 33:42.095
You are not supposed to
be lifting heavy things.

33:42.119 --> 33:43.279
What are you talking about?

33:47.357 --> 33:48.601
Now they're just making stuff up.

33:48.625 --> 33:50.859
You need to sit down
and not over-exert yourself.

33:50.961 --> 33:51.827
I can't believe I had
to find out this way.

33:51.929 --> 33:53.128
I am your best friend.

33:53.230 --> 33:54.910
I don't need to,
'cause I'm not pregnant.

33:54.998 --> 33:56.342
Are you sure? Have you taken a test?

33:56.366 --> 33:58.246
I don't need to take a
test. I'm not pregnant.

33:59.536 --> 34:00.714
How do you feel about
your fiancee Jordan

34:00.738 --> 34:02.070
marrying Matt Swift?

34:02.172 --> 34:04.284
I'm going to go out on a
limb and guess that's Peter.

34:04.308 --> 34:05.607
I am a lawyer.

34:05.709 --> 34:07.943
This is private property.
You all are trespassing.

34:08.045 --> 34:09.210
Open the door, honey!

34:09.313 --> 34:11.545
Give us something.

34:11.648 --> 34:15.150
Let's go talk in my room.

34:15.252 --> 34:17.319
And then bishop,

34:17.420 --> 34:19.020
he came into my office, and he said,

34:19.123 --> 34:20.889
"is this really the
image you want to portray

34:20.991 --> 34:21.889
to the senior partners?"

34:21.992 --> 34:23.391
None of it's true.

34:23.494 --> 34:27.262
One part is true. You
went to his premiere.

34:27.364 --> 34:29.431
I had no choice.

34:29.533 --> 34:31.166
I had to find out what was going on.

34:31.268 --> 34:33.168
And what is going on?

34:33.270 --> 34:34.735
His lawyers are working on it.

34:34.838 --> 34:36.838
It does not take this
long to file a petition.

34:36.940 --> 34:38.706
I've done it a thousand times.

34:38.809 --> 34:40.253
He assured me that
everything is on track

34:40.277 --> 34:41.143
for the annulment to
go through this week.

34:41.245 --> 34:42.677
It had better be,

34:42.780 --> 34:44.190
or I'm taking matters into my own hands.

34:44.214 --> 34:46.915
- I am tired of waiting.
- So am I.

34:50.286 --> 34:51.319
- Are you?
- Yes.

34:51.420 --> 34:52.821
I hope that's true, Jordan.

34:52.922 --> 34:55.791
Now, I have to get back to the office.

34:55.893 --> 34:57.325
You just... you...

34:57.427 --> 35:00.228
you sit here and you
think about what you did.

35:21.620 --> 35:22.886
It's a sham.

35:22.988 --> 35:25.188
Don't insult the nice lady, Jordan.

35:25.290 --> 35:27.691
It's a beautiful dress.

35:27.793 --> 35:30.627
That's not what I mean. I'm an imposter.

35:30.729 --> 35:32.607
You're only supposed to wear
white to your first wedding.

35:32.631 --> 35:35.699
Elizabeth Taylor wore white
at five out of eight weddings.

35:35.801 --> 35:37.567
It really is an archaic concept,

35:37.669 --> 35:40.870
so could we do away with
that large Scarlet a, please?

35:40.972 --> 35:43.206
This is supposed to be
the happiest day of my life,

35:43.308 --> 35:44.841
and he's ruining it.

35:44.943 --> 35:49.312
Yeah, if only he hadn't
clubbed you over the head

35:49.414 --> 35:50.574
and dragged you to the altar,

35:50.649 --> 35:52.049
you wouldn't be in this predicament.

35:52.084 --> 35:55.251
By the way, we could always
let it out in the stomach area

35:55.354 --> 35:58.521
to accommodate any unexpected
growth, couldn't we?

35:58.623 --> 36:00.168
Mom, how many times
do I have to tell you?

36:00.192 --> 36:01.624
I'm not pregnant.

36:01.727 --> 36:03.326
These days, Jordy,

36:03.428 --> 36:06.863
I just don't know what to believe.

36:09.835 --> 36:12.335
I'm not pregnant.

36:12.437 --> 36:15.271
He called? The security guard?

36:15.374 --> 36:16.639
Yes, his name is Chris,

36:16.742 --> 36:18.541
and he's an aspiring screenwriter.

36:18.643 --> 36:20.710
We're going out on Saturday night.

36:20.812 --> 36:22.045
He was cute.

36:22.147 --> 36:23.046
I'm glad some good came
out of this debacle.

36:23.148 --> 36:24.681
You have to come with me.

36:24.783 --> 36:26.361
Claire, I can't go with
you on your first date.

36:26.385 --> 36:27.450
You have to!

36:27.552 --> 36:29.219
I do everything wrong,

36:29.321 --> 36:30.601
and I don't want to screw it up.

36:30.655 --> 36:33.390
I need you to run interference
between me and my mouth.

36:33.492 --> 36:35.759
Okay, I will see
if Peter wants to go.

36:35.861 --> 36:37.238
We can double date if
you need a chaperone.

36:37.262 --> 36:39.996
I've got to go. Okay, goodbye.

36:40.098 --> 36:41.331
'Kay, bye.

36:41.433 --> 36:43.433
Hey, you got a minute?

36:43.535 --> 36:44.912
I was just going
over my new listings.

36:44.936 --> 36:48.138
So this circus is getting
a little out of hand,

36:48.240 --> 36:51.374
don't you think?

36:51.476 --> 36:55.412
I am so, so sorry, Alan.

36:55.514 --> 37:00.250
I'm really, really trying
to handle the situation.

37:00.352 --> 37:01.629
Maybe you should take some time off,

37:01.653 --> 37:03.486
get the whole thing squared away.

37:03.588 --> 37:05.422
Are you firing me?

37:05.524 --> 37:07.557
No, nothing like that.

37:07.659 --> 37:10.093
It's just, it's a bit disruptive to me

37:10.195 --> 37:12.829
and co-workers and...

37:12.931 --> 37:14.776
You were going to take
time off for the honeymoon.

37:14.800 --> 37:16.766
You'll just... Start a little sooner.

37:16.868 --> 37:21.171
- Okay.
- Okay.

37:31.349 --> 37:33.383
- Eric Spencer's office.
- Do not put me on hold.

37:33.485 --> 37:34.485
This is Jordan Grady,

37:34.553 --> 37:35.763
I am the current wife of Matt Swift,

37:35.787 --> 37:37.231
and I need to speak with Eric urgently.

37:37.255 --> 37:41.591
Okay, just one moment, please.

37:47.199 --> 37:48.264
Hey, Jordan, how are you?

37:48.366 --> 37:50.366
I'm not happy. Thank you for asking.

37:50.469 --> 37:52.802
Is there anything
I can do about that?

37:52.904 --> 37:55.371
I am sick of waiting for
you people to contact me.

37:55.474 --> 37:57.006
I know, I know, I'm so sorry.

37:57.108 --> 37:59.676
These things take time.

37:59.778 --> 38:01.155
You know, I keep hearing
that and still no progress.

38:01.179 --> 38:04.948
So I need you to put me in
touch with Matt Swift today.

38:05.050 --> 38:07.884
That is easier said than
done. He's a busy guy.

38:07.986 --> 38:09.185
He's shooting a movie.

38:09.287 --> 38:12.055
All I have to do is
walk outside my front door,

38:12.157 --> 38:14.924
and I have the attention
of the entire press corps,

38:15.026 --> 38:16.993
so you have him call
me or I go out there

38:17.095 --> 38:20.163
and I make up some very dirty... Dirt.

38:22.968 --> 38:25.001
Okay, um, I'll tell you what,

38:25.103 --> 38:28.671
why don't you come by the
studio Monday, say 1:00-ish?

38:28.773 --> 38:32.675
That's what I thought you'd say.

38:32.777 --> 38:37.747
I'm actually pretty pleased
with the latest draft, so...

38:37.849 --> 38:39.949
I'll hear if the agent's
interested next week.

38:40.051 --> 38:42.252
That's great, Chris.
Good luck with that.

38:42.354 --> 38:43.486
Thanks.

38:43.588 --> 38:46.222
You know who would
actually be great for this

38:46.324 --> 38:48.625
is Matt Swift.

38:48.727 --> 38:50.860
I know it's a lot to
ask, but do you think that

38:50.962 --> 38:54.864
there's any way you
could slip him a script?

38:57.836 --> 39:02.605
I don't really know him.

39:02.707 --> 39:04.027
Wh... I thought that you were...

39:05.777 --> 39:09.913
You know, I read something today,

39:10.015 --> 39:13.216
that the term "getting fired",

39:13.318 --> 39:15.785
it actually stems from olden days

39:15.887 --> 39:18.555
where they would just
burn people's houses down

39:18.657 --> 39:19.800
- and get rid of them.
- Really?

39:19.824 --> 39:20.690
Wow, where did you read

39:20.792 --> 39:25.328
that random yet fascinating tidbit?

39:25.430 --> 39:28.197
<i>Cosmo.</i>

39:28.300 --> 39:29.911
It's really great that
we have evolved as a people.

39:29.935 --> 39:32.802
Have we evolved?

39:32.904 --> 39:34.070
'Cause I don't think so.

39:43.548 --> 39:45.848
- Hi, my name is Jordan...
- yes, miss Grady.

39:45.951 --> 39:47.650
Your husband's expecting you.

39:47.752 --> 39:49.419
So you just want to
go straight down here,

39:49.521 --> 39:50.731
make a left, and then you'll see

39:50.755 --> 39:52.533
a parking space clearly
marked with your name.

39:52.557 --> 39:55.458
- Have a nice day.
- Thanks.

40:07.939 --> 40:10.974
Can we get this lovely
lady leaning on the car?

40:11.076 --> 40:13.242
Thank you.

40:13.345 --> 40:17.213
And the older gentleman,
we need him on his mark.

40:19.751 --> 40:21.050
Hi, miss Grady.

40:21.152 --> 40:22.430
We have a chair for you over here.

40:22.454 --> 40:23.920
Thank you. And it's Jordan.

40:24.022 --> 40:26.589
- Rolling!
- Marks.

40:26.691 --> 40:28.925
We're about to break for lunch.

40:29.027 --> 40:34.030
You can watch the
action in that monitor.

40:38.069 --> 40:39.069
Marks.

40:39.104 --> 40:40.837
And... Action.

40:40.939 --> 40:45.308
You think you've got problems?

40:45.410 --> 40:48.311
We all got problems, Mickey.

40:48.413 --> 40:52.248
Some of us just deal with
them better than others.

40:52.350 --> 40:53.916
Some of us don't rat out our friends

40:54.019 --> 40:56.786
when the going gets tough.

40:56.888 --> 41:02.291
Some of us live by a code of loyalty...

41:02.394 --> 41:04.727
And others don't.

41:04.829 --> 41:07.530
So... Where do you live, Mickey?

41:07.632 --> 41:10.400
Where do you live?

41:10.502 --> 41:14.804
And cut. Beautiful, gentlemen.

41:14.906 --> 41:17.774
All right, that's the one.

41:17.876 --> 41:20.510
- And, that's lunch.
- Background, back to places.

41:20.612 --> 41:23.579
Hey, little lady. First
time on a movie set?

41:23.682 --> 41:25.081
You are quite the show off.

41:25.183 --> 41:28.117
Well, thank you very
much. What'd you think?

41:28.219 --> 41:30.687
I'm no expert, but I thought

41:30.789 --> 41:32.855
you were a little stiff.

41:32.957 --> 41:35.825
Stiff?

41:35.927 --> 41:37.694
Really? How?

41:37.796 --> 41:40.697
I don't know, it just
didn't seem very natural.

41:44.169 --> 41:46.636
Hold that thought.

41:46.738 --> 41:48.071
Cal...

41:48.173 --> 41:50.840
I want to go again.
I just... another one.

41:50.942 --> 41:53.276
Buddy, it was perfect. You
don't need another take.

41:53.378 --> 41:54.410
No, no, no, I was stiff.

41:54.512 --> 41:55.945
I was stiff.

41:56.047 --> 41:58.681
Guys, I'm sorry about this.
We're gonna go one more time.

41:58.783 --> 42:00.049
Let's take it back to one.

42:00.151 --> 42:02.118
- All right, everybody back.
- Good.

42:02.220 --> 42:05.054
Back to one.

42:05.156 --> 42:08.491
One more time.

42:14.933 --> 42:17.266
- Thank you.
- There you go.

42:17.368 --> 42:18.234
- How nice.
- Enjoy.

42:18.336 --> 42:20.403
Thank you.

42:20.505 --> 42:22.038
My last three films have bombed,

42:22.140 --> 42:24.640
<i>Rookie cop, it's a fluke.</i>

42:24.743 --> 42:26.709
I've been getting bad
advice for too long now,

42:26.811 --> 42:27.877
and I trust your judgment.

42:27.979 --> 42:29.545
Why? You don't even know me.

42:29.647 --> 42:31.481
'Cause you call it as it is, Jordan.

42:31.583 --> 42:33.649
You never ask for anything.
You don't have an angle.

42:33.752 --> 42:36.285
That's not true. I want an annulment.

42:36.387 --> 42:38.020
See?

42:38.123 --> 42:39.600
You're blowing holes
in my theory already.

42:39.624 --> 42:41.023
That's what I'm talking about.

42:41.126 --> 42:43.893
Hollywood is this opportunistic world.

42:43.995 --> 42:45.228
You never know who to trust.

42:45.330 --> 42:48.331
And then along comes
this big blue-eyed girl

42:48.433 --> 42:49.913
who... not to brag... is in a position

42:49.968 --> 42:51.312
that a lot of girls would want to be in,

42:51.336 --> 42:52.336
and all you want is out.

42:52.437 --> 42:54.370
So I should consider myself lucky?

42:54.472 --> 42:55.905
Absolutely. Sweepstakes lucky.

42:57.108 --> 42:58.486
You did say that night it was fate.

42:58.510 --> 43:00.510
Are you sure I said
"fate" and not "fake"?

43:00.612 --> 43:02.389
I don't think you said
"fake brought us together".

43:02.413 --> 43:03.591
Maybe you should
have your ears checked.

43:03.615 --> 43:05.448
I think you need
to realize you said it

43:05.550 --> 43:07.261
- and you should own it.
- Okay, fine, I said it.

43:07.285 --> 43:09.263
But just because I said
it doesn't mean I meant it.

43:09.287 --> 43:11.587
Of course, whatever you say.

43:11.689 --> 43:13.623
Look, Matt...

43:13.725 --> 43:16.726
You are not the vapid,
egotistical, Hollywood actor

43:16.828 --> 43:19.595
that I thought you were.

43:19.697 --> 43:20.857
Well, give me some time.

43:20.899 --> 43:22.231
I'll actually get to that point.

43:22.333 --> 43:25.067
But I would like my
life to go back to normal.

43:25.170 --> 43:26.447
No more cameras in my bathroom window,

43:26.471 --> 43:29.005
<i>no more timeline: Hollywoodreports.</i>

43:29.107 --> 43:30.339
Peter can't even look at me.

43:30.441 --> 43:32.175
He's like a stranger,
and I don't blame him.

43:32.277 --> 43:34.777
Does he know how hard you're
working to fix this mess?

43:34.879 --> 43:37.446
I don't think he cares.
He wants results now.

43:37.549 --> 43:38.749
Well, he's gonna get results.

43:38.817 --> 43:40.383
We're going to be single by Friday.

43:40.485 --> 43:41.529
Just try to keep your week open.

43:41.553 --> 43:43.052
I hope so.

43:43.154 --> 43:46.355
If you'll notice, in this article,

43:46.457 --> 43:47.990
not all annulments are granted.

43:48.092 --> 43:49.103
It really depends on the judge.

43:49.127 --> 43:51.160
Organized there.

43:51.262 --> 43:53.329
Look, Eric's told us... he's assured me,

43:53.431 --> 43:54.642
they're going to tell us
whatever we need to know

43:54.666 --> 43:57.133
so that the annulment will be granted.

43:57.235 --> 44:02.738
I guess I have no
choice but to trust you.

44:02.841 --> 44:05.474
And, just so you know,

44:05.577 --> 44:09.412
I wouldn't have gone
to the press about you.

44:09.514 --> 44:12.381
Well, by the way, just so you know,

44:12.483 --> 44:14.083
I never really thought you would.

44:14.185 --> 44:16.853
You're a good person, Jordan Grady.

44:16.955 --> 44:18.654
You're not the best
judge of acting talent,

44:18.756 --> 44:22.725
but you're a good person.

44:22.827 --> 44:25.228
Come on, Mickey.

44:25.330 --> 44:28.331
What's it gonna be?

44:28.433 --> 44:33.069
I told you, carmine,
I'm in it with you 100%.

44:33.171 --> 44:34.203
I ain't no rat.

44:37.942 --> 44:39.475
Really? That's the best you can do?

44:39.577 --> 44:41.377
It's no worse than what you just did.

44:41.479 --> 44:43.813
Thank you, thank you.

44:43.915 --> 44:45.275
All right, this is serious, Jordan.

44:45.316 --> 44:46.849
- Okay?
- Okay.

44:46.951 --> 44:50.453
You're playing an
80-year-old lifetime gangster.

44:50.555 --> 44:52.188
Channel the mobster.

44:52.290 --> 44:55.324
Just feel the mobster.

44:55.426 --> 44:56.959
- Just be the mobster.
- Okay, okay.

44:57.061 --> 44:58.294
I'm sorry to ruin your scene.

44:58.396 --> 44:59.396
Let's try this again.

45:01.666 --> 45:03.733
I told you, carmine.

45:03.835 --> 45:07.737
I'm in it wit' you 100%.

45:07.839 --> 45:08.938
I ain't no rat.

45:09.040 --> 45:10.306
Yeah, you know what,

45:10.408 --> 45:13.209
I'm thinking you're more
of the gangster's moll.

45:13.311 --> 45:14.977
Let's... let's try that, the Lana scene.

45:15.079 --> 45:16.079
- Okay.
- Yeah.

45:16.114 --> 45:19.015
Yeah, let's try that.

45:29.394 --> 45:31.861
- Hey, how you doing, sir?
- Good.

45:31.963 --> 45:33.562
I'm Matt Swift's attorney.

45:33.665 --> 45:34.875
I have these documents for him to sign.

45:34.899 --> 45:36.632
Okay. What's your name?

45:36.734 --> 45:39.502
Look, guy, I'm here
every other day to see him.

45:39.604 --> 45:41.871
You do this to me every time.

45:41.973 --> 45:45.241
Thank you very much.

45:49.881 --> 45:51.981
I've had enough of you, all right?

45:52.083 --> 45:54.383
You think you work for rocko?
No, you work for me now.

45:54.485 --> 45:58.688
You watch him, all right?

45:58.790 --> 46:02.658
Hey, hey, hey, you are on my set.

46:02.760 --> 46:05.061
- Whoa!
- What's going on?

46:05.163 --> 46:06.362
Who is this guy?

46:06.464 --> 46:07.608
What is going on here?

46:07.632 --> 46:10.266
No problem, I'm all set here.

46:10.368 --> 46:12.012
Please escort that
gentleman off the lot.

46:12.036 --> 46:14.203
- Don't worry about it.
- Are you all right?

46:14.305 --> 46:16.172
Who is this man?

46:19.078 --> 46:20.411
We can work around this, Matt.

46:20.513 --> 46:23.147
Yeah, we can't cover it
until the swelling goes down.

46:23.249 --> 46:24.348
- It won't match.
- Okay.

46:24.450 --> 46:29.753
Great, once again,
I don't make my day.

46:29.855 --> 46:32.489
You, you go down to security,

46:32.591 --> 46:34.358
and you tell them no
one gets on this set

46:34.460 --> 46:37.828
without a pass, a picture
I.D., and a note from god!

46:37.930 --> 46:39.897
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, sir.

46:39.999 --> 46:42.900
Then go! Move! Move faster.

46:43.002 --> 46:46.236
Nice shiner. You're supposed to duck.

46:46.338 --> 46:47.971
Well, he's fast for an attorney.

46:48.074 --> 46:48.939
Sugar ray lawyer.

46:49.041 --> 46:50.908
Sugar ray lawyer.

46:51.010 --> 46:53.677
That's good... Any messages?

46:53.779 --> 46:55.657
Your mom wanted to make
sure you're eating meat

46:55.681 --> 46:56.681
for dinner next weekend.

46:56.749 --> 46:58.182
When did I stop?

46:58.284 --> 47:00.417
he read it in Movieline's
Famous Vegetarians issue,

47:00.519 --> 47:02.186
and wanted to double check.

47:02.288 --> 47:03.887
And Burt feedler called,

47:03.989 --> 47:06.168
wanted to know if he should file
the petition for annulment yet.

47:06.192 --> 47:07.391
Wait a minute.

47:07.493 --> 47:08.937
It was filed right
after the movie opened.

47:08.961 --> 47:10.561
Not according to Burt.

47:10.663 --> 47:12.796
He said he was supposed to
hold off, per your orders,

47:12.898 --> 47:14.398
until Eric gave him the go-ahead.

47:14.500 --> 47:17.801
You mean this process
hasn't even started yet?

47:17.903 --> 47:20.871
Evidently not.

47:20.973 --> 47:26.243
- Wait, wait, wait.
- I'll get the other one.

47:26.345 --> 47:29.747
That... Is gross.

47:34.353 --> 47:35.385
Hi.

47:35.488 --> 47:37.855
Hey.

47:37.957 --> 47:40.023
What's all this junk?

47:40.126 --> 47:42.359
Nice to see you too, honey.

47:42.461 --> 47:44.461
I thought I'd start slowly
bringing my things over,

47:44.563 --> 47:45.929
so I don't bombard you all at once.

47:46.031 --> 47:47.642
- Sheets and towels.
- I have sheets and towels.

47:47.666 --> 47:48.866
For one person,

47:48.968 --> 47:50.512
but there are going to
be two people living here,

47:50.536 --> 47:52.803
which is why I brought
closet organizers.

47:52.905 --> 47:54.204
Great.

47:54.306 --> 47:56.218
So now I'll have a bunch of
mismatched sheets and towels

47:56.242 --> 47:57.107
littering my linen closet.

47:57.209 --> 47:59.610
I have it all charted out.

47:59.712 --> 48:00.822
It will hardly be littering.

48:00.846 --> 48:03.147
Hey, do whatever you want, Jordan.

48:03.249 --> 48:04.448
Did I do something to you?

48:04.550 --> 48:07.718
I mean, aside from the obvious.

48:07.820 --> 48:11.922
What were you doing at
the movie studio today?

48:12.024 --> 48:14.391
- What?
- I followed you.

48:14.493 --> 48:17.561
I went to talk to
him about the annulment.

48:17.663 --> 48:19.530
And is it done?

48:19.632 --> 48:21.965
This week, by Friday.

48:22.067 --> 48:24.468
- I see.
- Peter...

48:24.570 --> 48:27.004
I'll tell you when this
is gonna be done, Jordan...

48:27.106 --> 48:29.406
never, because you like this life.

48:29.508 --> 48:30.874
You love being in the limelight.

48:30.976 --> 48:32.609
Hollywood premieres, movie studios...

48:32.711 --> 48:33.951
I've never seen you this happy.

48:34.046 --> 48:36.346
Yeah, that's right,
I'm just ecstatic.

48:36.448 --> 48:38.415
I have no job, no privacy,

48:38.517 --> 48:40.083
and a fiance who will hardly look at me.

48:40.186 --> 48:42.319
Well, gosh, whose
fault is this, Jordan?

48:42.421 --> 48:44.555
How many times do
I have to apologize?

48:44.657 --> 48:46.690
I made a mistake that
I am trying to remedy.

48:46.792 --> 48:48.292
When will you stop punishing me?

48:48.394 --> 48:52.029
I don't think I can trust you again.

48:55.067 --> 48:58.602
Thank you, Peter.

48:58.704 --> 49:01.772
Thank you for being so forthcoming.

49:01.874 --> 49:03.874
I am glad to know who you really are

49:03.976 --> 49:08.378
before we pledge our
lives to each other.

49:08.480 --> 49:11.448
Hey, I hope Matt enjoys
the sheets and towels

49:11.550 --> 49:14.484
and closet organizers.

49:15.855 --> 49:17.754
Very big money.

49:17.857 --> 49:20.557
Hey, look, you know I have a deal...

49:20.659 --> 49:22.726
can I call you back? Great.

49:22.828 --> 49:26.463
- Nice shiner.
- Whoa, nice shiner.

49:26.565 --> 49:30.801
Thanks... To you.

49:30.903 --> 49:33.470
The annulment was supposed
to be taken care of by now.

49:33.572 --> 49:36.006
That... yeah, you've
got to trust that

49:36.108 --> 49:37.352
I know what I'm doing here, Matt.

49:37.376 --> 49:38.609
No, I told you to end this.

49:38.711 --> 49:41.011
Yeah, and I needed
to keep you in the news,

49:41.113 --> 49:42.646
whether you wanted it or not.

49:42.748 --> 49:46.250
<i>Rookie cop has exceeded
all expectations,</i>

49:46.352 --> 49:50.287
and... Boom! I got your quote up.

49:50.389 --> 49:53.724
And what about her?

49:53.826 --> 49:56.460
Who "her"? You mean the wifey?

49:56.562 --> 50:00.464
Yes, my wife, and her name is Jordan.

50:00.566 --> 50:02.532
You're messing with someone's life here.

50:02.635 --> 50:05.435
So what? She's freeloading.

50:05.537 --> 50:07.905
She's latched herself
onto your celebrity.

50:08.007 --> 50:09.439
They're a dime a dozen in this town.

50:09.541 --> 50:13.210
She doesn't deserve this.

50:13.312 --> 50:15.345
Okay, fine. Okay.

50:15.447 --> 50:18.448
No, she's a wonderful, terrific girl,

50:18.550 --> 50:20.617
and we will fix this now, okay?

50:20.719 --> 50:25.589
But you, my friend,
should be thanking me.

50:27.259 --> 50:32.763
You hired me to manage you
because you trust my judgment.

50:32.865 --> 50:34.998
Everything I've ever
done has been for you.

50:35.100 --> 50:36.111
No, everything you've ever done is

50:36.135 --> 50:37.312
because you got 10% riding on it.

50:37.336 --> 50:39.002
My...

50:39.104 --> 50:42.339
come on, man, don't
go... overreact here.

50:42.441 --> 50:44.541
I'm not doing overreact,

50:44.643 --> 50:46.310
just questioning whether or not

50:46.412 --> 50:49.313
I need you as my manager any more.

50:52.785 --> 50:55.152
I'll sue you.

50:55.254 --> 50:58.288
- We have a contract.
- Well, thanks, Eric.

50:58.390 --> 51:03.727
You just made that
decision a lot easier.

51:03.829 --> 51:06.930
Look, okay, just take some
time to cool off, all right?

51:07.032 --> 51:09.666
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

51:09.768 --> 51:12.269
Come on, Matt.

51:12.371 --> 51:14.171
Great. This is great.

51:14.273 --> 51:15.939
- Vivienne.
- Yes, I am right here.

51:16.041 --> 51:16.907
I didn't hear anything
that was happening.

51:17.009 --> 51:19.276
- Unbelievable.
- Sorry.

51:19.378 --> 51:21.011
Peter hasn't called.

51:21.113 --> 51:24.047
- The wedding's off.
- He'll call, Jordy.

51:24.149 --> 51:25.415
Once he cools off.

51:25.517 --> 51:27.517
He's not gonna throw away
your entire relationship.

51:29.955 --> 51:35.559
Maybe that's prince charming right now.

51:43.202 --> 51:45.268
- I'm... I'm sorry?
- Come in.

51:45.371 --> 51:46.414
Ooh, come in, please, good sir.

51:46.438 --> 51:48.872
Why is she talking like that?

51:48.974 --> 51:50.140
Jordan, hi.

51:50.242 --> 51:51.975
Matt Swift is here in my house.

51:52.077 --> 51:55.946
- Nice shiner.
- Yeah.

51:56.048 --> 51:58.315
Stunt gone awry. Occupational hazard.

51:58.417 --> 51:59.427
That's why you get the big bucks.

51:59.451 --> 52:02.219
Um... Could we have a minute?

52:02.321 --> 52:06.923
Yeah, yeah, we'll just...
we'll leave you two alone.

52:07.026 --> 52:09.126
Don't forget to tell
him about Chris' script.

52:09.228 --> 52:11.228
Yeah, okay.

52:11.330 --> 52:13.196
- Bye.
- Yes.

52:13.298 --> 52:16.633
So I hope it's okay that I just came by.

52:16.735 --> 52:19.236
Yeah, we were just eating pizza.

52:19.338 --> 52:21.138
Okay.

52:21.240 --> 52:24.074
And... I'm sorry.

52:24.176 --> 52:25.809
I mean, the whole thing's my fault.

52:25.911 --> 52:28.979
My first mistake was thinking
Eric and I were friends.

52:29.081 --> 52:31.715
Yeah, aside from my family
and childhood friends,

52:31.817 --> 52:34.651
most of the people in my
world are paid to be there.

52:34.753 --> 52:36.686
That's sad.

52:36.789 --> 52:40.457
Yeah. I trust too easily, I guess.

52:40.559 --> 52:41.758
When you're in my position,

52:41.860 --> 52:44.628
people just tell you
what you want to hear...

52:44.730 --> 52:46.930
Except for you.

52:47.032 --> 52:48.999
You never seem to do that, Jordan.

52:49.101 --> 52:50.901
You never seem to.

52:51.003 --> 52:53.904
Well, I'm glad I'm able to
please somebody these days.

52:54.006 --> 52:55.439
Peter's still mad.

52:55.541 --> 52:57.374
He's not speaking to me.

52:57.476 --> 52:59.509
I don't know if we're on or we're off.

52:59.611 --> 53:03.046
I know I'm at fault, but
he's got to give a little.

53:03.148 --> 53:04.426
Otherwise, I don't know what we have.

53:04.450 --> 53:07.417
Yeah, and at least now we
know what the hold up was.

53:07.519 --> 53:08.785
The annulment's moving forward.

53:08.887 --> 53:10.327
I don't think that matters anymore.

53:10.355 --> 53:11.488
I mean, the urgency.

53:11.590 --> 53:12.756
What's he saying?

53:12.858 --> 53:14.691
I can't hear what he's saying.

53:14.793 --> 53:16.526
- Does he love her?
- Hold on.

53:16.628 --> 53:20.330
- Well...
- Go, go, go, go.

53:20.432 --> 53:23.500
I want to tell you that
Eric wasn't the only one.

53:23.602 --> 53:24.901
Excuse us!

53:25.003 --> 53:26.681
We thought you guys might
want a little mood food.

53:26.705 --> 53:28.839
Thank you. I'm good.

53:28.941 --> 53:32.008
- Yes.
- Yeah, you are.

53:32.111 --> 53:35.879
Wow.

53:35.981 --> 53:38.381
Yeah.

53:38.484 --> 53:40.851
Do you want to go out?

53:40.953 --> 53:42.419
<i>I mean, out.</i>

53:42.521 --> 53:43.386
Out?

53:43.489 --> 53:45.021
Of here.

53:45.124 --> 53:46.924
Yeah, we both could
use a little fun, right?

53:50.329 --> 53:51.862
What else?

53:51.964 --> 53:53.597
Milkshakes. Black and white.

53:53.699 --> 53:55.165
Ooh, ooh, and mini corndogs!

53:55.267 --> 53:57.300
Excuse me?

53:57.402 --> 53:59.614
Two black and white milkshakes
and an order of mini corndogs.

53:59.638 --> 54:00.638
Good call.

54:00.706 --> 54:02.339
You want a drink drink?

54:02.441 --> 54:04.141
Right. Sorry.

54:04.243 --> 54:05.253
That's what got us into this mess.

54:05.277 --> 54:06.409
Thank you.

54:06.512 --> 54:08.478
I really think that a
table full of junk food

54:08.580 --> 54:10.013
is exactly what we needed right now.

54:10.115 --> 54:11.148
Agreed.

54:11.250 --> 54:12.883
Just don't tell my personal trainer.

54:12.985 --> 54:14.784
I already put it on my blog, sorry.

54:16.054 --> 54:18.555
- You play?
- What?

54:18.657 --> 54:20.624
Competitive air hockey.

54:20.726 --> 54:22.425
- Never.
- Not even once?

54:22.528 --> 54:24.861
- I don't know how.
- It's a piece of cake.

54:24.963 --> 54:26.630
- Come on.
- We should get some cake.

54:26.732 --> 54:28.532
Well, yeah, right
after the air hockey.

54:28.634 --> 54:29.766
But my corndogs.

54:29.868 --> 54:31.401
They have to cool. Come on.

54:31.503 --> 54:33.136
- All right.
- Come on.

54:33.238 --> 54:34.315
I just don't want to embarrass you

54:34.339 --> 54:35.739
by beating you mercilessly.

54:35.841 --> 54:36.951
You think you're gonna beat me.

54:36.975 --> 54:38.275
I could.

54:38.377 --> 54:40.421
You're cute and all, but
you don't seem very athletic.

54:40.445 --> 54:42.679
Are you... look, look
at these guns right here.

54:42.781 --> 54:46.183
I once learned how to joust
for a movie in four days.

54:46.285 --> 54:48.062
I think I can take you
in a little air hockey.

54:48.086 --> 54:50.120
Care to put your money
where your mouth is?

54:50.222 --> 54:51.733
My money is always where my mouth is.

54:51.757 --> 54:52.856
What does that even mean?

54:52.958 --> 54:57.027
It means you're about
to get slaughtered.

54:57.129 --> 54:58.129
Bring it on.

55:04.136 --> 55:06.836
She shoots, she scores.

55:06.939 --> 55:10.507
It's a hat trick for
gretzky. The crowd goes wild.

55:10.609 --> 55:13.043
- Whoooooo.
- I can't believe it.

55:13.145 --> 55:15.245
You... you're a ringer.

55:15.347 --> 55:16.747
You practically forced me to play.

55:16.815 --> 55:18.949
What was I supposed to do, let you win?

55:19.051 --> 55:20.450
I don't cave to celebrity.

55:20.552 --> 55:23.687
This, this is the
Jordan I know and love.

55:23.789 --> 55:25.300
You ought to blow off
steam a little more often.

55:25.324 --> 55:26.489
Do you think I'm uptight?

55:26.592 --> 55:28.291
Perhaps a wee bit rigid.

55:28.393 --> 55:30.093
I'm gonna pretend
you didn't say that,

55:30.195 --> 55:34.397
and I'm gonna go bask in my
glory with a mini corndog.

55:34.499 --> 55:36.600
How do they find you?

55:36.702 --> 55:38.969
Someone tweets, and
it's a matter of minutes.

55:39.071 --> 55:41.771
<i>- Information super highway.
- Informationautobahn.</i>

55:41.873 --> 55:44.808
Come on, guys, give us a chance?

55:51.383 --> 55:53.516
- Where'd they go?
- I don't know.

55:53.619 --> 55:58.321
- You okay?
- Yeah.

55:58.423 --> 56:02.392
Maybe out front.

56:02.494 --> 56:05.762
Corndog.

56:05.864 --> 56:07.397
Corndogs.

56:08.667 --> 56:10.200
Missy, missy.

56:10.302 --> 56:12.146
Looks like someone's been
out past their curfew.

56:12.170 --> 56:13.303
And it also looks like

56:13.405 --> 56:14.882
someone hasn't been
answering their cell...

56:14.906 --> 56:20.710
Because Peter called me on
my cell, looking for you.

56:34.559 --> 56:37.193
Listen, I've got to go.
I'll see you at the office.

56:37.296 --> 56:40.163
- Hi.
- Hi.

56:40.265 --> 56:41.609
Listen, I hope you don't
mind I already ordered,

56:41.633 --> 56:43.333
but I have to get back to the office.

56:43.435 --> 56:46.436
It's okay, I don't
have much of an appetite.

56:46.538 --> 56:48.938
So I've been doing a
lot of thinking about us.

56:49.041 --> 56:50.674
So have I.

56:50.776 --> 56:52.709
And I know I've disappointed you,

56:52.811 --> 56:56.046
but is it really worth throwing
away eight years together?

56:56.148 --> 56:58.982
Yes.

56:59.084 --> 57:00.650
Yes, it is.

57:00.752 --> 57:03.153
What?

57:03.255 --> 57:04.465
Jordan, maybe you
can get past all this,

57:04.489 --> 57:06.656
but I can't.

57:06.758 --> 57:08.892
The woman I fell in love
with, she was responsible

57:08.994 --> 57:11.161
and considerate.

57:11.263 --> 57:13.663
She would never do
the things you've done.

57:13.765 --> 57:15.632
I'm still the same person.

57:15.734 --> 57:18.368
Well, then you're not
who I thought you were.

57:18.470 --> 57:23.306
So what are you saying?

57:23.408 --> 57:28.778
I'm saying I don't
want to marry you anymore.

57:28.880 --> 57:31.781
I'm saying I'd like my
grandmother's ring back.

57:46.601 --> 57:47.900
Mom, I am not in the mood

57:48.002 --> 57:49.569
to hear about how I've ruined my life.

57:49.671 --> 57:52.204
Well, good, because I
didn't come to tell you that.

57:52.307 --> 57:54.640
I came, actually, because
I thought you might need me.

57:54.742 --> 57:56.075
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

57:56.177 --> 57:59.779
You're gonna do exactly
what you have been doing.

57:59.881 --> 58:01.747
It'll just be without Peter.

58:01.849 --> 58:04.450
Claire, have you found
a new roommate yet?

58:04.552 --> 58:06.630
The press scared everyone off,
so it's fate that you're back.

58:06.654 --> 58:09.121
What are we going to tell everyone?

58:09.223 --> 58:11.691
That the wedding has
been indefinitely postponed.

58:11.793 --> 58:13.693
You don't owe anyone an explanation.

58:13.795 --> 58:16.228
I think they'll be
able to do the math.

58:16.331 --> 58:18.364
Yes, but you can't
keep the crystal bowls.

58:18.466 --> 58:20.166
I love the crystal bowls.

58:20.268 --> 58:24.070
Everything has to go back.

58:24.172 --> 58:25.771
I had my whole life planned out.

58:25.873 --> 58:28.140
I knew exactly what it was going to be.

58:28.242 --> 58:29.775
I think that, deep down,

58:29.877 --> 58:31.811
you weren't ready to marry Peter.

58:31.913 --> 58:34.347
You said it yourself. You
got caught up in a moment.

58:34.449 --> 58:37.049
Whenever I'm with Matt,
there's just no stress.

58:37.151 --> 58:39.163
I can just be me and not
worry about what people think.

58:39.187 --> 58:43.656
Sounds to me like maybe Vegas
was more than just a moment.

58:43.758 --> 58:44.969
I don't know what I'm going to do.

58:44.993 --> 58:47.059
I'm so confused.
Everything's just a mess.

58:47.161 --> 58:52.365
Jordy, everything
is going to be okay.

58:52.467 --> 58:56.669
And when the time is right,
and when the guy is right,

58:56.771 --> 59:00.306
your life is going to
fall into place perfectly.

59:00.408 --> 59:05.144
I hope so.

59:05.246 --> 59:07.847
Hello?

59:07.949 --> 59:11.183
Jordy, it's for you.

59:16.157 --> 59:19.659
- Hello.
- We have our hearing date.

59:23.031 --> 59:25.531
Thanks.

59:25.633 --> 59:26.766
Since it's evident

59:26.868 --> 59:28.634
that you were both
clearly of unsound mind

59:28.736 --> 59:31.070
at the time of this marriage,

59:31.172 --> 59:34.940
I'm gonna Grant you this annulment.

59:35.043 --> 59:37.777
Marriage is an institution

59:37.879 --> 59:41.447
that too many people
take too lightly the days.

59:41.549 --> 59:44.383
I expect that you both
will think long and hard

59:44.485 --> 59:47.219
before jumping into these waters again.

59:47.321 --> 59:48.754
Your honor.

59:48.856 --> 59:51.290
Jordan, talk to us. Sad
day. Matt dumped you.

59:51.392 --> 59:52.536
- What are you feeling right now?
- Guys, guys.

59:52.560 --> 59:53.640
Come on, Matt. Talk to us.

59:53.728 --> 59:55.027
It's been a really tough day.

59:55.129 --> 59:56.273
- What was it like in court?
- Jordan, do you have a comment?

59:56.297 --> 59:57.408
- Why now?
- Please, no comments.

59:57.432 --> 59:58.609
- Why such a short one?
- No comment, guys.

59:58.633 --> 59:59.932
No comment.

01:00:00.034 --> 01:00:01.278
Jordan, just talk to us
for a couple of seconds here.

01:00:01.302 --> 01:00:02.780
Give us some time.
Please, guys, come on.

01:00:02.804 --> 01:00:04.503
- Excuse me, thank you.
- What was it like?

01:00:04.605 --> 01:00:05.649
- Matt, who dumped who?
- Matt!

01:00:05.673 --> 01:00:08.674
No comment.

01:00:08.776 --> 01:00:10.276
You okay?

01:00:10.378 --> 01:00:11.555
None of this matters anymore.

01:00:11.579 --> 01:00:12.778
Peter called off the wedding.

01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:16.215
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:00:16.317 --> 01:00:17.516
It's okay.

01:00:17.618 --> 01:00:19.118
It's better to know who Peter is

01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:20.397
before things get complicated.

01:00:20.421 --> 01:00:21.854
Yeah, I guess.

01:00:21.956 --> 01:00:25.057
Times have been pretty trying
for us lately, haven't they?

01:00:25.159 --> 01:00:26.470
Do you always speak
in movie dialogue?

01:00:26.494 --> 01:00:30.062
Sorry. Occupational hazard.

01:00:30.164 --> 01:00:32.698
Listen, I'm going down
to San Diego this weekend,

01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:35.401
see my parents for some
rest, home-cooked meals,

01:00:35.503 --> 01:00:38.704
and some serious board
games with Ethel and Mike.

01:00:38.806 --> 01:00:41.774
Would you want to join us?

01:00:41.876 --> 01:00:44.143
Why?

01:00:44.245 --> 01:00:46.445
Because it's fun.

01:00:46.547 --> 01:00:48.714
It's well off the beaten
path from these guys.

01:00:48.816 --> 01:00:51.784
Give you a chance to
decompress undisturbed.

01:00:51.886 --> 01:00:53.686
Besides, me and my ego need a chance

01:00:53.788 --> 01:00:55.955
to redeem ourselves from
that air hockey debacle.

01:00:56.057 --> 01:00:58.657
As if that's possible.

01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:02.695
I happen to know that fun
is the best medicine for you.

01:01:02.797 --> 01:01:06.265
- What do you say?
- Okay, I'll go.

01:01:10.138 --> 01:01:13.139
Here he is at the senior prom.

01:01:13.241 --> 01:01:15.908
- Isn't he precious?
- Mom!

01:01:17.378 --> 01:01:19.011
There it is, proof.

01:01:19.113 --> 01:01:21.847
A mother loves her child no
matter how big of a dork he is.

01:01:21.949 --> 01:01:24.283
Yeah, or how big his head gets.

01:01:24.385 --> 01:01:25.662
You see? That's why I come home.

01:01:25.686 --> 01:01:29.155
These two remind me of
all my awkward years,

01:01:29.257 --> 01:01:30.501
and the insecurities come flooding back.

01:01:30.525 --> 01:01:32.057
You were pretty cute.

01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:33.526
And there he is,

01:01:33.628 --> 01:01:34.908
the only year he played baseball.

01:01:34.962 --> 01:01:37.029
Only the most
humiliating year of my life.

01:01:37.131 --> 01:01:39.431
Yeah, well, all my
life, all I ever wanted...

01:01:39.534 --> 01:01:40.677
- Here we go.
- Was a son who was in

01:01:40.701 --> 01:01:41.867
the major leagues.

01:01:41.969 --> 01:01:43.769
But my son, what does he decide to do?

01:01:43.871 --> 01:01:46.005
Wear tights.

01:01:46.107 --> 01:01:51.043
Yes, Michael, if only our son
had made something of himself.

01:01:51.145 --> 01:01:53.746
Bam! He's out of there!

01:01:53.848 --> 01:01:57.550
So, um, you know everything?

01:01:57.652 --> 01:02:01.320
Matt and I are very close.

01:02:01.422 --> 01:02:03.133
Then you must not
think very highly of me.

01:02:03.157 --> 01:02:05.257
On the contrary.

01:02:05.359 --> 01:02:06.519
I think you're the one person

01:02:06.594 --> 01:02:08.294
that hasn't wanted
something from my son.

01:02:08.396 --> 01:02:11.630
I have never done
anything that crazy.

01:02:11.732 --> 01:02:14.633
I take marriage very seriously.

01:02:14.735 --> 01:02:20.005
I believe you, Jordan.

01:02:20.107 --> 01:02:22.641
So, what do you think of Matthew?

01:02:22.743 --> 01:02:24.510
- I like him.
- Good.

01:02:24.612 --> 01:02:25.732
He's funny and sarcastic...

01:02:25.813 --> 01:02:29.415
And annoyingly famous,

01:02:29.517 --> 01:02:32.651
but... He makes me laugh.

01:02:32.753 --> 01:02:34.153
I think you're good for him.

01:02:34.255 --> 01:02:37.857
We're just friends.

01:02:37.959 --> 01:02:40.559
Just thrown together through
outrageous circumstances.

01:02:40.661 --> 01:02:43.329
Maybe so.

01:02:43.431 --> 01:02:45.342
But I haven't seen Matthew
look this happy with a girl

01:02:45.366 --> 01:02:48.267
for a very long time.

01:02:54.808 --> 01:02:57.242
It's really good.

01:02:57.344 --> 01:02:58.810
It needs some work,

01:02:58.913 --> 01:03:00.153
but it's just the kind of thing

01:03:00.214 --> 01:03:02.314
that Eric would have passed
on without telling me.

01:03:02.416 --> 01:03:05.784
I think it gives you a
chance to show what you've got.

01:03:05.886 --> 01:03:08.554
Yeah. I'll call the studio tomorrow.

01:03:08.656 --> 01:03:11.690
We'll see how much
Eric told me was true.

01:03:11.792 --> 01:03:13.236
I wonder if they'd
back me on this, though.

01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:14.993
I bet they would.

01:03:15.095 --> 01:03:17.362
You're a ridiculously huge star.

01:03:17.464 --> 01:03:19.498
I mean, I don't marry just anyone.

01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:21.266
I have pretty high standards.

01:03:21.368 --> 01:03:25.470
Is that so?

01:03:25.573 --> 01:03:29.441
It's pretty out here, isn't it?

01:03:29.543 --> 01:03:34.213
You want to... you wanna go in?

01:03:34.315 --> 01:03:37.182
Um, I don't want to get my hair wet.

01:03:37.284 --> 01:03:40.485
You don't want to get... come on.

01:03:40.588 --> 01:03:42.754
You don't have to go underwater.

01:03:42.856 --> 01:03:44.723
You could just, you know...

01:03:44.825 --> 01:03:49.228
Well, I, um, don't
really know how to swim.

01:03:49.330 --> 01:03:53.365
I never really learned.

01:03:53.467 --> 01:03:56.368
Okay.

01:03:56.470 --> 01:03:58.704
Would you want me to get
you some of the arm floaties?

01:03:58.806 --> 01:04:00.839
I know that my nephew
has some around here.

01:04:00.941 --> 01:04:04.209
That's okay. I don't need floaties.

01:04:07.815 --> 01:04:11.116
Is this... is this like
the air hockey moment?

01:04:11.218 --> 01:04:12.762
You're gonna tell me you
don't know how to swim,

01:04:12.786 --> 01:04:14.631
and then you pull an olympic
medal out of your pocket?

01:04:14.655 --> 01:04:17.956
No, really, truly, I
don't know how to swim.

01:04:18.058 --> 01:04:20.459
Not that hard. I could show you.

01:04:20.561 --> 01:04:24.129
In your clothes?

01:04:24.231 --> 01:04:26.109
What, you don't think
I'll go in in my clothes?

01:04:26.133 --> 01:04:27.966
No.

01:04:28.068 --> 01:04:30.202
I'll... that sounds
like a dare to me.

01:04:30.304 --> 01:04:34.072
I will show you.

01:04:36.243 --> 01:04:38.977
I'm serious, I will do this.

01:04:41.682 --> 01:04:43.815
Yeah!

01:04:46.153 --> 01:04:49.655
You see? You see, I did it!

01:04:49.757 --> 01:04:50.757
And I survived.

01:04:50.858 --> 01:04:52.324
So you are, but you can swim.

01:04:52.426 --> 01:04:53.725
Well, trust me.

01:04:53.827 --> 01:04:57.529
I am feeling very, very
optimistic about your abilities.

01:04:57.631 --> 01:05:00.198
Come on!

01:05:00.301 --> 01:05:01.833
You're thinking too much again.

01:05:01.935 --> 01:05:04.036
You've got to turn it off, Jordan Grady.

01:05:04.138 --> 01:05:05.704
Turn it off and let go.

01:05:05.806 --> 01:05:08.573
Do the thing that scares you to death.

01:05:08.676 --> 01:05:12.244
- Drowning?
- Yeah, I should rephrase that.

01:05:12.346 --> 01:05:13.623
I promise you, I won't let you drown.

01:05:13.647 --> 01:05:17.015
You can do it.

01:05:21.155 --> 01:05:23.088
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:05:23.190 --> 01:05:26.191
- You did it.
- You told me to let go.

01:05:26.293 --> 01:05:30.429
You took a chance and you survived.

01:05:42.209 --> 01:05:45.310
Good night.

01:05:57.591 --> 01:06:00.325
So I love your parents.

01:06:00.427 --> 01:06:03.061
- They're a bit much at times.
- They're very sweet.

01:06:03.163 --> 01:06:05.664
Well, I hope my mom with her photos

01:06:05.766 --> 01:06:06.631
didn't go overboard.

01:06:06.734 --> 01:06:07.899
I loved the photos.

01:06:08.001 --> 01:06:09.901
- And my dad.
- He's kooky.

01:06:10.003 --> 01:06:11.136
He's more than kooky.

01:06:11.238 --> 01:06:13.338
Trust me, he was on his
best behavior that weekend.

01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:14.973
I wish he would heat the pool.

01:06:15.075 --> 01:06:18.243
Yeah, he gets a little cheap.

01:06:18.345 --> 01:06:20.946
So, Do you want to come in?

01:06:21.048 --> 01:06:23.448
Yeah, I'd love to, but
I've got a ton of meetings.

01:06:23.550 --> 01:06:25.083
Call you soon?

01:06:25.185 --> 01:06:28.420
Thank you for this weekend...

01:06:28.522 --> 01:06:29.388
For everything.

01:06:29.490 --> 01:06:32.391
It was nice.

01:06:42.970 --> 01:06:46.338
- Yeah?
- Matthew.

01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:48.240
Eric, why are you calling me?

01:06:48.342 --> 01:06:50.709
We had a disagreement.

01:06:50.811 --> 01:06:51.977
It's not the first time

01:06:52.079 --> 01:06:54.780
I had a knockdown drag-out
with one of my clients.

01:06:54.882 --> 01:06:56.042
Happens in all relationships,

01:06:56.116 --> 01:06:59.017
so now we dust ourselves
off and we move forward.

01:06:59.119 --> 01:07:00.930
Yeah, well, I've got
different ideas for my career,

01:07:00.954 --> 01:07:02.198
and I'm sorry, you don't
fit in the picture anymore.

01:07:02.222 --> 01:07:05.390
Buddy, come on, we had
six great years together.

01:07:05.492 --> 01:07:07.125
Eric, it's done.

01:07:07.227 --> 01:07:08.693
I'm going with Cathy Riley at cbk.

01:07:08.796 --> 01:07:11.630
You still have one year
left on your contract with me.

01:07:11.732 --> 01:07:13.064
Let's do this civilized.

01:07:13.167 --> 01:07:14.766
When you mess with my livelihood,

01:07:14.868 --> 01:07:17.636
we are way beyond civilized.

01:07:26.046 --> 01:07:27.679
I'm so happy I have you back.

01:07:27.781 --> 01:07:29.192
It's kind of like I was never gone.

01:07:29.216 --> 01:07:30.427
Yeah, well, some of your stuff was,

01:07:30.451 --> 01:07:31.451
and I really missed it.

01:07:31.552 --> 01:07:32.784
Help me put it away,

01:07:32.886 --> 01:07:34.297
and maybe it will never leave you again.

01:07:34.321 --> 01:07:35.387
You know how I am.

01:07:35.489 --> 01:07:36.888
I can't rest until it's all done.

01:07:36.990 --> 01:07:39.257
Okay, well, I'm only helping you

01:07:39.359 --> 01:07:41.004
because you're going
back to work tomorrow,

01:07:41.028 --> 01:07:42.308
not because you're an ocd freak.

01:07:44.798 --> 01:07:47.132
It's Eric Spencer, Matt's agent.

01:07:47.234 --> 01:07:49.835
Hello, Mr. Spencer?

01:07:49.937 --> 01:07:53.004
Jordan, I have some information

01:07:53.106 --> 01:07:56.842
about your precious Matt that
you might find interesting.

01:07:56.944 --> 01:08:00.078
He just might not be the
catch you think he is.

01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:01.700
Does that pique your interest, sweetie?

01:08:20.202 --> 01:08:23.970
Hey.

01:08:24.073 --> 01:08:26.439
- What's the matter?
- Eric called me.

01:08:26.542 --> 01:08:28.942
I see.

01:08:29.044 --> 01:08:30.654
You told him to wait
until the vie opened

01:08:30.679 --> 01:08:33.180
- to start the annulment?
- Look, Jordan...

01:08:33.282 --> 01:08:34.492
Why would you use me like that?

01:08:34.515 --> 01:08:36.227
Look, I never should
have gone along with it.

01:08:36.251 --> 01:08:39.453
It was stupid and
insensitive, and I'm sorry.

01:08:39.555 --> 01:08:42.656
So I'm just supposed to
make all of this okay for you.

01:08:42.758 --> 01:08:43.902
No, no, that's not what I'm asking.

01:08:43.926 --> 01:08:46.760
Jordan, just let me say this.

01:08:46.862 --> 01:08:48.862
Ever since the weekend at my parents',

01:08:48.964 --> 01:08:50.140
I can't stop thinking about you.

01:08:50.165 --> 01:08:53.767
You're amazing, beautiful,

01:08:53.868 --> 01:08:55.279
and just knowing you has made me realize

01:08:55.304 --> 01:08:59.072
how cheap my little Matt
Swift world has become.

01:08:59.174 --> 01:09:00.652
I will do anything and everything I can

01:09:00.676 --> 01:09:01.707
to make this up to you.

01:09:01.810 --> 01:09:03.609
That's a great performance, Matt.

01:09:03.712 --> 01:09:05.345
- Jordan, please...
- please leave.

01:09:05.447 --> 01:09:06.712
- No.
- Just go.

01:09:06.814 --> 01:09:08.615
- Go.
- Come on.

01:09:08.716 --> 01:09:11.917
Leave.

01:09:15.524 --> 01:09:19.024
Thank you, Sarah.

01:09:19.127 --> 01:09:23.330
The nisslers are getting restless.

01:09:23.432 --> 01:09:25.076
They want to know why
escrow's taking so long.

01:09:25.100 --> 01:09:27.634
The mortgage company has
to do their due diligence,

01:09:27.736 --> 01:09:29.080
and they don't have the
greatest credit in the world,

01:09:29.104 --> 01:09:30.737
so they're gonna need to be patient.

01:09:40.349 --> 01:09:41.559
Are you gonna answer that?

01:09:41.582 --> 01:09:43.216
No. I know who it is.

01:09:43.318 --> 01:09:44.551
It's not important.

01:09:44.653 --> 01:09:47.953
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I really am.

01:09:48.055 --> 01:09:49.868
And I know the nisslers
are good friends of yours,

01:09:49.892 --> 01:09:51.024
so please tell them

01:09:51.126 --> 01:09:52.703
that I am going to get
them their dream house.

01:09:52.728 --> 01:09:54.494
- I promise.
- I will.

01:09:54.596 --> 01:09:55.874
I know you've been through a lot,

01:09:55.898 --> 01:09:57.864
but I just need you to
keep your head in the game.

01:09:57.966 --> 01:09:59.933
- Okay?
- I will.

01:10:00.035 --> 01:10:02.469
- I promise to focus.
- All right.

01:10:13.515 --> 01:10:15.460
Hello, it's Jordan Grady.
Please leave a message.

01:10:15.484 --> 01:10:18.852
Jordan, it's me, Matt.

01:10:18.954 --> 01:10:22.556
I'm trying to reach you. I'm sorry.

01:10:22.658 --> 01:10:25.559
Please talk to me?

01:10:25.661 --> 01:10:27.961
- Great yard.
- Yeah.

01:10:28.063 --> 01:10:29.274
The thing I like about this house

01:10:29.298 --> 01:10:31.231
is the breakfast nook.
Come on and check it out.

01:10:31.333 --> 01:10:33.413
Jordan, please, come on.
I'm trying to talk to you.

01:10:33.502 --> 01:10:36.203
Would you...

01:10:36.305 --> 01:10:40.207
all right, I'll call
you at home tonight.

01:10:43.278 --> 01:10:44.845
Mom.

01:10:44.947 --> 01:10:48.048
How you holding up?

01:10:48.150 --> 01:10:50.717
- Today was my wedding day.
- I know.

01:10:50.819 --> 01:10:53.253
That's why I'm here. Are you okay?

01:10:53.355 --> 01:10:55.956
I guess so.

01:11:03.498 --> 01:11:04.364
Aren't you going to answer that?

01:11:04.466 --> 01:11:07.300
No, it's him again.

01:11:07.402 --> 01:11:09.903
Wow, a celebrity stalking a civilian.

01:11:10.005 --> 01:11:13.607
Now that's a first.

01:11:13.709 --> 01:11:15.942
So maybe you should
hear what he has to say.

01:11:16.044 --> 01:11:17.811
Why? What's the point?

01:11:17.913 --> 01:11:20.580
Because, you said
yourself, he's a good person.

01:11:20.682 --> 01:11:24.217
What he did was wrong, but
he's trying to apologize.

01:11:24.319 --> 01:11:27.254
You know firsthand how that feels.

01:11:27.356 --> 01:11:28.889
He used me for his career.

01:11:32.427 --> 01:11:34.327
Did he?

01:11:34.429 --> 01:11:38.131
People do things that
they regret all the time,

01:11:38.233 --> 01:11:41.301
don't they, Jordan?

01:11:41.403 --> 01:11:44.137
You think about that.

01:11:44.239 --> 01:11:46.706
You want some tea?
I'll make you some tea.

01:11:52.748 --> 01:11:53.748
Hey, Jordan.

01:11:53.849 --> 01:11:57.617
It's me, Matt, calling again.

01:11:57.719 --> 01:12:00.353
I know you're home
and you can hear this,

01:12:00.455 --> 01:12:03.823
because... Well, I'm standing
outside of your place right now.

01:12:03.926 --> 01:12:09.095
Look, I let myself be manipulated,

01:12:09.197 --> 01:12:13.466
and I let other people call the shots,
and I am the biggest jerk ever.

01:12:13.568 --> 01:12:18.004
I did that thing. I
listened to my manager

01:12:18.106 --> 01:12:22.342
and my press, and I believed it.

01:12:22.444 --> 01:12:25.478
And, I don't know, I thought
I had it all figured out.

01:12:25.580 --> 01:12:28.715
But then I met... You.

01:12:28.817 --> 01:12:33.119
And you were so real and honest,

01:12:33.221 --> 01:12:36.056
not to mention funny,

01:12:36.158 --> 01:12:37.402
and you never asked for anything.

01:12:37.426 --> 01:12:41.461
And for once...

01:12:41.563 --> 01:12:45.498
I felt like I could let someone in.

01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:48.435
So I want to thank you

01:12:48.537 --> 01:12:52.472
for letting me be me.

01:12:52.574 --> 01:12:55.075
Look, I... I know you're furious,

01:12:55.177 --> 01:12:56.354
and I'm gonna stop bothering you,

01:12:56.378 --> 01:12:59.412
so I will... Count to five,

01:12:59.514 --> 01:13:01.948
and if you don't answer it by then,

01:13:02.050 --> 01:13:07.420
I... I guess I'll just
never call you again.

01:13:07.522 --> 01:13:08.989
Okay?

01:13:09.091 --> 01:13:11.691
So... So here goes.

01:13:11.793 --> 01:13:14.661
One,

01:13:14.763 --> 01:13:18.064
two,

01:13:18.166 --> 01:13:21.935
three,

01:13:22.037 --> 01:13:24.904
four...

01:13:25.007 --> 01:13:27.507
Come on, Jordan.

01:13:27.609 --> 01:13:30.510
Five.

01:13:43.959 --> 01:13:45.992
Looks like he's not done trying.

01:13:46.094 --> 01:13:48.194
I have more for you. I'll be right back.

01:13:48.296 --> 01:13:49.562
Thanks.

01:13:49.664 --> 01:13:51.376
He's always gotten
everything he ever wanted.

01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:53.277
People trip over themselves
to give him what he wants.

01:13:53.301 --> 01:13:54.801
He's just feeling sorry for himself.

01:13:54.903 --> 01:13:57.270
It's from Chris.

01:13:57.372 --> 01:14:01.408
Matt got Chris' movie sold.

01:14:01.510 --> 01:14:02.854
He's doing the movie. Good for him.

01:14:02.878 --> 01:14:07.013
Great, I finally meet this amazing man,
and he sends you flowers.

01:14:07.115 --> 01:14:10.150
Here you go, ladies.

01:14:10.252 --> 01:14:11.985
Have a good day.

01:14:12.087 --> 01:14:13.219
Thanks.

01:14:15.581 --> 01:14:17.357
Must've been some script.

01:14:24.332 --> 01:14:27.267
They're for me.

01:14:32.574 --> 01:14:36.943
"Every single part of my
life is because of you.

01:14:37.045 --> 01:14:38.511
Love, Chris".

01:14:38.613 --> 01:14:41.714
I stand corrected.

01:14:41.816 --> 01:14:45.118
Matt, how does it feel
to be back in the $100 million club.

01:14:45.220 --> 01:14:47.754
<i>Rookie cop?</i>

01:14:49.324 --> 01:14:53.860
It feels... Cheap.

01:14:53.962 --> 01:14:55.628
The movie is so embarrassingly bad,

01:14:55.730 --> 01:14:57.141
it should be a crime to
charge the public to see it.

01:14:57.165 --> 01:14:58.664
That's how it feels.

01:14:58.767 --> 01:15:00.133
Wow, well, it...

01:15:00.235 --> 01:15:01.434
It's still in the theater.

01:15:01.536 --> 01:15:06.806
You're messing with my box office,
you stupid, ungrateful actor.

01:15:06.908 --> 01:15:08.107
You have so many fans.

01:15:08.209 --> 01:15:11.310
Do you really think it's a crime for
them to support one of your films?

01:15:11.413 --> 01:15:13.546
No, let me be clear,
I support my fans,

01:15:13.648 --> 01:15:16.582
and I appreciate them
coming out to see my work,

01:15:16.684 --> 01:15:19.719
but this particular
project... Be forewarned.

01:15:19.821 --> 01:15:24.724
Okay, well... Let's get personal
and talk about your secret wedding.

01:15:24.826 --> 01:15:27.860
What possessed you to run
off and go get hitched?

01:15:27.962 --> 01:15:31.030
You've been linked to so many
a- list leading ladies.

01:15:31.132 --> 01:15:33.232
What was special and
different about this girl

01:15:33.334 --> 01:15:34.233
that made you want to settle down?

01:15:34.335 --> 01:15:37.503
We're calling in sick.

01:15:37.605 --> 01:15:39.350
Well, I know everyone's
looking for some dramatic story,

01:15:39.374 --> 01:15:43.009
but it wasn't that. It was... A moment.

01:15:43.111 --> 01:15:46.045
And I don't regret it for a second,

01:15:46.147 --> 01:15:49.315
because I met the most
amazing woman I've ever known.

01:15:49.417 --> 01:15:52.919
She's really the only person
outside of my family that knows me,

01:15:53.021 --> 01:15:55.888
not the Matt Swift
that publicists created.

01:15:55.990 --> 01:16:00.526
She's funny and adoringly charming,

01:16:00.628 --> 01:16:04.997
and... Just sweet.

01:16:05.099 --> 01:16:08.641
How difficult is it to be
in a relationship in the public eye?

01:16:08.703 --> 01:16:11.337
That's a good question.

01:16:11.439 --> 01:16:14.740
Look, I know my life
has been incredibly charmed,

01:16:14.843 --> 01:16:18.678
but being a celebrity isn't always easy.

01:16:18.780 --> 01:16:21.514
Being the wife of one is even harder,

01:16:21.616 --> 01:16:27.320
and just knowing me
has caused her a great deal of harm.

01:16:27.422 --> 01:16:31.190
I'll always be indebted to
her for being real with me

01:16:31.292 --> 01:16:34.360
and inspiring me...

01:16:34.462 --> 01:16:37.096
And just listening to
me 'cause she wanted to.

01:16:37.198 --> 01:16:41.300
Look, Holly, I live my
life with no regrets,

01:16:41.402 --> 01:16:44.470
but I have caused her
a great deal of pain,

01:16:44.572 --> 01:16:49.041
and, for that, I... Do have regrets,

01:16:49.143 --> 01:16:54.614
and let's just say
I'm truly, truly sorry.

01:16:54.716 --> 01:16:56.364
Very insightful.

01:16:57.485 --> 01:17:02.755
More with my revealing interview with
Matt Swift coming up after the break.

01:17:13.868 --> 01:17:16.035
He's so in love with you.

01:17:16.137 --> 01:17:18.071
- Do you think so?
- Did you not just see that?

01:17:18.173 --> 01:17:19.839
Okay, I've got to think.

01:17:19.941 --> 01:17:21.474
Call him.

01:17:21.576 --> 01:17:22.875
I'm gonna call him. Yeah.

01:17:22.978 --> 01:17:25.011
Okay, yeah, I'm gonna call
him. I'm gonna call him.

01:17:25.113 --> 01:17:27.447
Right, okay, I don't know his number.

01:17:27.549 --> 01:17:28.448
You don't have his number?

01:17:28.550 --> 01:17:30.850
No, no, he always called me.
I've never called him.

01:17:30.952 --> 01:17:32.063
What about all the
messages he's left you?

01:17:32.087 --> 01:17:33.119
I erased them.

01:17:33.221 --> 01:17:34.787
- Call his manager!
- He fired him.

01:17:34.889 --> 01:17:36.623
Um, um, he'll call again.

01:17:36.725 --> 01:17:39.226
No, no, no, because he counted
to five and I didn't pick up.

01:17:39.261 --> 01:17:40.381
He's never gonna call again,

01:17:40.462 --> 01:17:42.428
because I didn't pick up
when he counted to five.

01:17:42.530 --> 01:17:44.097
I completely ruined it. I've blown it.

01:17:44.199 --> 01:17:46.532
No, you know where he
works! Go to the studio.

01:17:46.635 --> 01:17:49.235
I'm gonna go to the studio!
I've been there! They like me.

01:17:49.337 --> 01:17:50.514
I'm gonna go to the studio,
I'm gonna take a risk,

01:17:50.538 --> 01:17:52.739
I'm just gonna dive in
face first, so to speak.

01:17:52.841 --> 01:17:54.574
I'm gonna do that. Okay, okay.

01:17:54.676 --> 01:17:56.342
- Jordy!
- What? I'm going to the studio.

01:17:56.444 --> 01:17:58.911
- Put some clothes on first.
- Yeah. Right.

01:17:59.014 --> 01:18:01.047
Yes, okay. Jacket.

01:18:01.149 --> 01:18:03.516
I found one. Okay, I'm gonna go,

01:18:03.618 --> 01:18:04.884
I'm gonna go to the studio.

01:18:07.055 --> 01:18:10.290
- All right, bye.
- Bye!

01:18:10.392 --> 01:18:13.326
She's in her pajamas. Boy.

01:18:18.300 --> 01:18:19.198
Hey, I'm here to see Matt.

01:18:19.301 --> 01:18:20.933
- Name, please.
- Jordan Grady.

01:18:21.036 --> 01:18:25.471
- I'm Matt Swift's wife.
- Matt doesn't have a wife.

01:18:25.573 --> 01:18:28.474
Okay? And no one gets on
the lot without a drive-on.

01:18:28.576 --> 01:18:31.311
You don't remember me? You've
let me on the lot before.

01:18:31.413 --> 01:18:33.112
- Was your name on the list?
- Yes.

01:18:33.214 --> 01:18:34.325
Well, is it on the list now?

01:18:34.349 --> 01:18:35.515
- No, but he's...
- okay.

01:18:35.617 --> 01:18:39.352
No one gets on the
lot without a drive-on.

01:18:39.454 --> 01:18:42.088
Please, sir, have a heart.

01:18:42.190 --> 01:18:44.757
My future happiness depends
on me getting on this lot.

01:18:44.859 --> 01:18:50.296
My future employment depends
on this list, so turn it around.

01:19:00.775 --> 01:19:02.553
Jordan Grady, you
could spend the entire day

01:19:02.577 --> 01:19:05.122
sitting outside the studio,
just hoping he comes out the gate,

01:19:05.146 --> 01:19:06.279
or you could go get him.

01:19:06.381 --> 01:19:09.882
I am always sneaking into places
and breaking rules for this guy.

01:19:09.984 --> 01:19:11.117
He is worth it.

01:19:11.219 --> 01:19:14.788
He's a movie star, and
he's amazing, and he loves you.

01:19:14.823 --> 01:19:18.324
Okay, I'm going in.

01:19:21.396 --> 01:19:23.429
- I'm in.
- Okay.

01:19:23.531 --> 01:19:25.331
Well, just... just keep
talking to me, okay?

01:19:25.433 --> 01:19:26.966
But... but talk like you belong there,

01:19:27.068 --> 01:19:29.402
like you're doing a big
movie deal or something.

01:19:29.504 --> 01:19:33.673
And of course, casting is a major
stipulation in the green light process.

01:19:33.775 --> 01:19:37.343
"Green light process",
really good movie term usage.

01:19:37.445 --> 01:19:39.005
I think I've been spotted.

01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:40.580
Hey!

01:19:40.682 --> 01:19:43.850
Hey, you! Come back here!

01:19:43.952 --> 01:19:46.619
We have a 415 in front of stage two.

01:19:46.721 --> 01:19:49.122
A young woman in weird
pants and a weirder top.

01:19:49.224 --> 01:19:52.158
I'm en route!

01:19:55.397 --> 01:19:58.476
Okay, I am being chased by
a studio rent-a-cop in a golf cart.

01:19:58.500 --> 01:20:00.566
I don't believe this.

01:20:00.668 --> 01:20:02.735
You... you are... you
are like "The Fugitive".

01:20:02.837 --> 01:20:06.072
You are Harrison Ford!

01:20:07.709 --> 01:20:08.608
Hey, watch out.

01:20:08.710 --> 01:20:10.176
Move it back. Let's go.

01:20:10.278 --> 01:20:11.544
I'm almost to Matt's trailer.

01:20:13.014 --> 01:20:14.981
Hello? Matt?

01:20:16.985 --> 01:20:18.785
Matt!

01:20:18.887 --> 01:20:20.219
Hold it.

01:20:20.321 --> 01:20:21.687
Don't move.

01:20:21.790 --> 01:20:23.267
I think I better go. I'll
call you from jail, okay?

01:20:23.291 --> 01:20:25.425
Jail? Hel... you're kidding, right?

01:20:25.527 --> 01:20:26.793
Hello? Hello?

01:20:26.895 --> 01:20:30.696
Kerry, Kerry, please help me.
Can you get Matt?

01:20:30.799 --> 01:20:32.999
I'm sorry, Jordan. He left more than
half an hour ago.

01:20:33.101 --> 01:20:34.211
No, no. He... he can't be gone.

01:20:34.235 --> 01:20:35.268
Let me call him.

01:20:35.370 --> 01:20:36.614
Okay, let's not go crazy here, guys.

01:20:36.638 --> 01:20:38.204
Hello?

01:20:38.306 --> 01:20:40.273
Studio security is not a joke.

01:20:40.375 --> 01:20:44.204
It is here for the visitors
and the employees and their safety.

01:20:44.245 --> 01:20:45.445
Point taken.

01:20:45.547 --> 01:20:47.291
There's no need to bring
the real police into this.

01:20:47.315 --> 01:20:50.049
Not that you're not real law
enforcement, because you so are.

01:20:50.151 --> 01:20:51.195
Just hold on... Matt will
clear this whole thing up.

01:20:51.219 --> 01:20:52.752
Wait... just wait. Just wait, okay?

01:20:52.854 --> 01:20:55.388
That hurts a little bit.

01:20:55.490 --> 01:20:57.056
Six days on one, and then I did...

01:20:57.158 --> 01:20:59.158
Matt!

01:20:59.260 --> 01:21:01.227
Jor... Jordan?

01:21:01.329 --> 01:21:02.829
Henry, what's going on?

01:21:02.931 --> 01:21:04.341
Well, Mr. Swift, she was trespassing

01:21:04.365 --> 01:21:05.365
on private property.

01:21:05.433 --> 01:21:06.799
I'm sorry.

01:21:06.901 --> 01:21:09.335
Henry, she's on the list.
She's on the permanent list.

01:21:09.437 --> 01:21:11.115
You're just doing your
job. I appreciate it.

01:21:11.139 --> 01:21:13.017
Maybe next time, you just
call me and double check.

01:21:13.041 --> 01:21:14.521
- Yes, sir. Will do, sir.
- All right.

01:21:14.576 --> 01:21:16.876
Sorry. Henry!

01:21:16.978 --> 01:21:18.611
The cuffs?

01:21:18.713 --> 01:21:21.514
- Right, sir.
- Wow.

01:21:21.616 --> 01:21:24.116
What are you... are you in your pajamas?

01:21:24.219 --> 01:21:26.886
It's a blazer and my
pajamas and other stuff.

01:21:26.988 --> 01:21:30.423
It's a... I've never done
anything that crazy before.

01:21:30.525 --> 01:21:32.792
I happen to know that's not the case.

01:21:32.894 --> 01:21:35.127
Jordan, why are you here?

01:21:35.230 --> 01:21:37.630
- I saw the interview.
- Yeah?

01:21:37.732 --> 01:21:38.931
- And...
- and...

01:21:39.033 --> 01:21:41.968
I want to be with you too.

01:21:42.070 --> 01:21:44.737
Look, this world gets really crazy.

01:21:44.839 --> 01:21:45.839
Are you sure?

01:21:45.907 --> 01:21:47.187
You have to earn my trust back.

01:21:47.242 --> 01:21:51.444
I'm gonna make it up to you.

01:21:51.546 --> 01:21:53.145
Even if it takes forever.

01:21:53.248 --> 01:21:55.848
It's kind of funny how
we did things backwards.

01:21:55.950 --> 01:21:58.050
First, marriage, then dating.

01:21:58.152 --> 01:22:02.321
Yeah, it's like our souls
connected before we did.

01:22:03.725 --> 01:22:05.391
There's that movie dialogue again.

01:22:05.493 --> 01:22:07.860
I know. The writers are
so much more eloquent than me.

01:22:07.962 --> 01:22:10.429
I actually think they're pretty cheesy.

01:22:10.532 --> 01:22:12.565
If you don't kiss me by
the time I count to five...

01:22:12.667 --> 01:22:14.433
One...

01:22:14.536 --> 01:22:16.469
- I wrote that.
- Two...

01:22:16.571 --> 01:22:19.171
4 3/4...

01:22:19.274 --> 01:22:21.741
4 11/27...

01:22:27.097 --> 01:22:28.229
Come on.

01:23:06.487 --> 01:23:10.923
Congratulations!
