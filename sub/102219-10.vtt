00:09.134 --> 00:11.761
["Marley Purt Drive" playing]

00:38.079 --> 00:39.330
What time is it?

00:40.331 --> 00:41.666
Time to sleep in.

00:42.250 --> 00:43.835
Are the kids up?

00:43.918 --> 00:45.170
I got it.

00:46.254 --> 00:47.547
You da best.

00:47.630 --> 00:50.425
[song continues playing]

00:59.809 --> 01:01.019
Breakfast time!

01:01.102 --> 01:02.687
-[imitates shooting]
-[kids scream]

01:02.771 --> 01:04.022
Wake up, nuggets!

01:04.105 --> 01:05.982
-[Dean laughs]
-[exclaims]

01:12.822 --> 01:14.324
I'm up.

01:14.407 --> 01:16.534
K-man. If you're not up in five,

01:16.618 --> 01:18.912
I'm coming back
with the fire extinguisher again.

01:49.400 --> 01:51.236
[indistinct chatter on TV]

01:54.823 --> 01:55.698
Oh!

01:55.782 --> 01:58.201
Hey. Look at what I got.

01:58.284 --> 02:01.454
Mint. I got maple cream,

02:01.538 --> 02:04.791
I got birthday cake
and I got double stuff.

02:04.874 --> 02:08.670
Trade amongst yourselves. Mix and match.
But do not tell your mother.

02:08.753 --> 02:11.005
Where… Wait. Where is she, by the way?

02:11.089 --> 02:13.508
-Work.
-Okay, well…

02:13.591 --> 02:16.136
We're supposed to
load up the minivan. Right?

02:16.219 --> 02:17.095
I don't know.

02:18.680 --> 02:21.182
-When's she coming home?
-I don't know.

02:22.267 --> 02:23.852
But she said no snacks.

02:25.478 --> 02:27.897
[Rio] Ink. Chemicals. Paper.

02:29.149 --> 02:32.235
-The hologram is polymer.
-One-stop shop.

02:32.318 --> 02:33.528
Everything you need.

02:34.904 --> 02:36.447
Why are you making it so easy?

02:36.531 --> 02:38.491
Because you bitches made it so messy.

02:39.868 --> 02:41.244
What happens when I gotta wash it?

02:41.327 --> 02:44.330
-Don't worry about it.
-Where am I supposed to do it?

02:45.206 --> 02:48.042
Duty Free? Tim Hortons downtown?

02:48.126 --> 02:50.170
-They take Canadian?
-You don't have to.

02:51.296 --> 02:53.381
-What about my cut?
-What about it?

02:53.464 --> 02:55.508
-Does it come in loonies?
-Elizabeth?

02:59.971 --> 03:03.808
[exhales] All you have to do
is print and drop.

03:07.937 --> 03:09.564
Your husband's here.

03:15.904 --> 03:17.697
Just need to…

03:18.740 --> 03:19.991
trade cars.

03:22.660 --> 03:23.620
Now?

03:25.163 --> 03:28.249
Thought we'd hit the road
early for, you know…

03:28.875 --> 03:31.002
Oh! Kenny's game, yeah.

03:35.465 --> 03:36.341
[clicks tongue]

03:36.424 --> 03:38.468
You're not supposed to be here.

03:39.594 --> 03:40.762
Yeah, neither are you.

03:40.845 --> 03:42.430
-[Rio laughs]
-[ankle bracelet beeps]

03:42.513 --> 03:46.059
No, man, I mean, it's not gonna be good
for anybody when the cops come.

03:47.435 --> 03:49.812
I'm within range. It's low battery.

03:52.774 --> 03:53.983
Please, just go.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.962
[Stan] How you feel about baby blue?

04:15.129 --> 04:16.005
[Ruby] Eh.

04:16.547 --> 04:20.009
[Stan] Okay. How about… ostrich?

04:21.052 --> 04:22.178
Better.

04:23.179 --> 04:24.264
Okay. Okay.

04:25.139 --> 04:26.182
What if…

04:29.143 --> 04:30.853
we combined the two?

04:30.937 --> 04:33.690
-That the new one?
-Yep.

04:33.773 --> 04:36.025
She said we can swap whatever we want.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.485
Awesome.

04:37.568 --> 04:39.779
Yeah, lowers our cost, like, 8%.

04:39.862 --> 04:42.657
-Good for you.
-This is good for sales.

04:42.740 --> 04:44.659
Next party's gonna be pure profit, baby.

04:44.742 --> 04:46.327
Oh, I'm not going.

04:49.872 --> 04:51.874
-Hey, what now?
-Can't.

04:53.584 --> 04:55.586
I didn't even tell you when it is.

04:55.670 --> 04:56.838
Doesn't matter.

04:58.089 --> 05:01.592
Wait. Baby, you're the one
that wanted to keep this train running.

05:01.676 --> 05:04.679
Not if you two are gonna keep
clapping at each other.

05:04.762 --> 05:07.098
Oh, my God. Ruby.

05:07.181 --> 05:09.058
No one is clapping at anyone.

05:09.142 --> 05:12.061
No, it's worse.
Last party, you didn't speak to her.

05:12.145 --> 05:13.521
What? I got nothing to say.

05:13.604 --> 05:16.566
I had to be the go-between
for my husband and best friend.

05:16.649 --> 05:19.485
-Then don't be.
-You don't have to love her.

05:19.569 --> 05:20.611
Don't.

05:20.695 --> 05:23.531
-Don't even have to like her.
-Oh, I don't.

05:23.614 --> 05:25.450
Just take the high road.

05:28.244 --> 05:29.329
What for?

05:30.288 --> 05:31.164
Me.

05:33.624 --> 05:34.667
[sighs]

05:36.210 --> 05:37.628
You say all this to her?

05:46.429 --> 05:47.889
She can take the high road.

05:50.266 --> 05:51.768
[Kevin] <i>Our first family meeting.</i>

05:54.645 --> 05:56.481
-Just meeting.
-One sec.

06:01.235 --> 06:04.322
Okay. First up,
let's go over the bathroom rules.

06:04.405 --> 06:06.240
I know, I know. Off limits.

06:06.324 --> 06:08.576
No, we're cool if you use it.

06:09.243 --> 06:10.912
But I got the bucket.

06:10.995 --> 06:15.124
Yeah. We'd actually like you
to get rid of that.

06:15.208 --> 06:16.250
Mmm.

06:16.793 --> 06:20.421
Number two, do not wash
your underwear in the kitchen sink.

06:20.505 --> 06:22.381
Mmm. Let me guess. Bathroom.

06:22.465 --> 06:24.342
Washer. It's in the basement.

06:24.425 --> 06:25.927
And it's free.

06:26.511 --> 06:28.763
What? [chuckles]

06:30.348 --> 06:32.141
Okay. Um…

06:33.267 --> 06:35.728
Where do you guys stand on parties?

06:35.812 --> 06:36.729
Anti.

06:36.813 --> 06:40.149
We're also anti your music,
and the shopping cart

06:40.233 --> 06:42.735
that's parked in the hallway
with the cans in it.

06:42.819 --> 06:43.778
My bank account?

06:44.403 --> 06:45.404
Got to go.

06:48.783 --> 06:52.161
Which I believe brings us to the timeline.

06:53.246 --> 06:55.039
How long are we talking here?

06:55.957 --> 06:57.125
For what?

06:58.126 --> 07:00.586
For the length of stay.

07:01.963 --> 07:05.466
-I don't understand the question.
-When will you be leaving?

07:05.550 --> 07:07.009
When's graduation?

07:09.053 --> 07:10.346
Uh…

07:19.272 --> 07:20.231
[door closes]

07:21.357 --> 07:23.443
Is his name Chris or Kevin?

07:24.277 --> 07:26.195
It is way too late to ask.

07:34.537 --> 07:37.290
Car is packed. They hit the ice at 7:00.

07:38.332 --> 07:39.375
Okay.

07:40.293 --> 07:42.170
[Dean] Next year, he'll be bantamweight,

07:42.253 --> 07:44.881
so you won't have to get up
at the crack of dawn.

07:44.964 --> 07:45.965
Dean.

07:46.841 --> 07:48.885
I mean, I really wish I could take him.

07:50.595 --> 07:52.680
No one knew this would happen.

07:52.763 --> 07:54.807
Can you FaceTime me when he plays?

07:54.891 --> 07:57.268
Not me, not the Secret Service…

07:57.351 --> 08:00.229
-Don't.
-I'm trying to explain what you saw.

08:00.313 --> 08:01.647
I didn't see anything.

08:04.942 --> 08:05.902
All right.

08:09.030 --> 08:12.116
-Just FaceTime me, please.
-Yeah.

08:22.585 --> 08:24.295
How are you doing, dear?

08:26.797 --> 08:27.757
Good.

08:30.259 --> 08:32.386
I'll have them to you in an hour.

08:33.095 --> 08:35.681
What happened with the Klein <i>bat mitzvah?</i>

08:36.933 --> 08:38.768
The one with the pop-up <i>Torahs?</i>

08:39.435 --> 08:42.939
-They were a week late.
-Yeah, but she loved them.

08:43.940 --> 08:46.859
She didn't really have a choice, did she?

08:48.653 --> 08:50.029
Is everything okay?

08:51.489 --> 08:53.991
We need to talk about Megan.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.703
Oh, God. That wasn't on her.

08:57.787 --> 08:59.121
I'm gonna make some changes.

08:59.205 --> 09:02.667
No, no. I was just going through some
personal stuff. That was totally my fault.

09:03.918 --> 09:06.003
She's getting promoted.

09:08.047 --> 09:09.966
Oh. To what?

09:10.925 --> 09:12.301
Shift manager.

09:16.681 --> 09:17.890
Isn't that my job?

09:20.101 --> 09:21.936
You're a wonderful mother.

09:22.019 --> 09:25.147
Spend more time at home.
They grow up so fast.

09:25.231 --> 09:27.733
My husband's out of work.
I really need this job.

09:27.817 --> 09:29.652
I need someone I can rely on.

09:29.735 --> 09:31.237
Megan's in eleventh grade.

09:31.320 --> 09:34.365
[chuckles] Sweetie, it's just a job.

09:34.448 --> 09:38.578
Oh, Dorothy. It is so much more than that.

09:40.788 --> 09:41.872
[sighs]

09:41.956 --> 09:45.334
I'm gonna need you
to clean out your craft cubby.

09:52.466 --> 09:53.718
I still don't get it.

09:54.552 --> 09:55.761
What's there to get?

09:55.845 --> 09:59.890
How will they know who they want to marry
if they can't see each other?

09:59.974 --> 10:01.601
[Ruby] That's literally the point.

10:01.684 --> 10:02.768
[Annie] But they're blind.

10:04.020 --> 10:09.358
For four episodes, she thought
this show was about blind people dating?

10:10.693 --> 10:12.028
-It's not?
-Thank you.

10:13.029 --> 10:14.614
What is wrong with y'all?

10:14.697 --> 10:18.409
We have bigger issues right now
than Amber and Barnett.

10:18.492 --> 10:20.953
Yeah. Jessica won't hump Mark.

10:21.037 --> 10:23.039
You know, I don't see why.

10:23.122 --> 10:25.833
She can't see anything. Excuse me.

10:25.916 --> 10:28.169
We don't have anywhere to print, guys.

10:29.128 --> 10:31.464
Ugh. Can't we just sneak in?

10:31.547 --> 10:34.050
Yeah. Middle of the night, do one big run?

10:34.133 --> 10:37.303
Because it's never one.
He always wants more.

10:37.386 --> 10:38.596
So, we'll go back.

10:39.430 --> 10:40.973
Then she'll change the alarm.

10:41.057 --> 10:44.226
-Why don't we steal the whole thing?
-Hey. Now you're talking.

10:44.310 --> 10:47.855
Okay. And then, what do we do
with a two-ton printing press?

10:48.481 --> 10:50.900
I don't know. We'd put it in your garage.

10:51.525 --> 10:54.987
So Mrs. Karpinski can just drop in
and borrow the leaf blower?

10:55.071 --> 10:57.365
What's she gonna do, call a Mountie?

10:57.448 --> 10:59.950
Or my kids walk in
and Mom's printing cash.

11:00.034 --> 11:02.119
I can see that that could be a problem.

11:02.203 --> 11:03.663
I got a place.

11:03.746 --> 11:06.540
Let's just get another storage unit,
you know?

11:07.375 --> 11:10.836
Electricity, drainage, ventilation.

11:10.920 --> 11:12.797
-Calm down.
-Guys.

11:12.880 --> 11:15.424
Not to mention space, privacy.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.468
It's called a brainstorming sesh.

11:17.551 --> 11:19.261
I know where we can do it.

11:21.764 --> 11:22.681
Where?

11:23.432 --> 11:25.810
Strip club. Still shut down.

11:25.893 --> 11:27.645
Can Stan get us in?

11:30.689 --> 11:34.652
-What do we have to do to convince him?
-Not "we."

11:42.159 --> 11:43.035
What?

11:43.744 --> 11:45.621
[woman] <i>We have</i>
<i>a Philly cheesesteak special.</i>

11:45.704 --> 11:49.291
That'll come on an onion roll,
choice of side, fries or coleslaw.

11:50.209 --> 11:51.836
I think we need a couple minutes.

11:51.919 --> 11:53.587
[woman] Set you up with some waters.

12:00.928 --> 12:02.930
-Want to share something?
-The answer's no.

12:03.013 --> 12:04.974
Or just get your own.

12:05.057 --> 12:07.643
I'm not putting my neck
on the line for you.

12:08.394 --> 12:09.645
It's not just for me.

12:09.728 --> 12:12.356
I don't want my wife
in anything else you got going.

12:12.440 --> 12:13.816
Well, it's a little late for that.

12:16.444 --> 12:19.530
-[woman] Ready to order?
-She's on her own.

12:19.613 --> 12:20.990
Couple more minutes.

12:24.952 --> 12:27.037
This guy doesn't care about what you want.

12:27.121 --> 12:30.082
-Find someplace else, okay?
-There is nowhere else.

12:30.166 --> 12:34.420
Beth. The less you and I
got to deal with each other, the better.

12:34.503 --> 12:37.798
You think he's gonna let us off
the hook because you're pissed at me?

12:37.882 --> 12:41.844
You've got to worry about your family
and I've got to worry about mine.

12:42.595 --> 12:43.804
I'm sorry.

12:45.931 --> 12:47.057
[sighs]

12:49.435 --> 12:50.978
Is that what you want to hear?

12:53.898 --> 12:55.232
What for?

13:01.947 --> 13:03.157
What you sorry for?

13:09.663 --> 13:10.956
I am sorry…

13:13.375 --> 13:16.420
that you feel that I have…

13:19.465 --> 13:22.301
somehow put your family in a…

13:23.802 --> 13:27.264
not ideal situation.

13:28.891 --> 13:32.269
Okay. All right, let me try this one on.

13:34.104 --> 13:37.107
So, you're sorry
that I feel you should be sorry.

13:37.191 --> 13:39.777
-What else do you want?
-I want you to mean it.

13:42.738 --> 13:43.948
Okay.

13:46.158 --> 13:47.409
I am sorry.

13:47.493 --> 13:48.661
Better.

13:49.620 --> 13:54.250
I'm sorry that what I got your wife into
makes her happy.

13:54.333 --> 13:56.585
That's how you're gonna play this?

13:56.669 --> 13:58.587
Not to mention pays your bills.

14:05.386 --> 14:06.637
You know what I want?

14:10.099 --> 14:11.308
Please.

14:13.519 --> 14:15.396
I want you out of her life.

14:25.072 --> 14:25.990
Okay.

14:28.075 --> 14:29.076
Okay.

14:32.454 --> 14:35.666
You get us in that club,
and she'll never see me again.

14:38.002 --> 14:38.878
Maid of honor.

14:39.503 --> 14:43.424
-I know.
-You're just gonna give all that up.

14:45.926 --> 14:47.636
Dean's facing 20 to 30.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.557
Can't stick around for a trial.

14:59.148 --> 15:00.691
What looks good, folks?

15:07.448 --> 15:09.158
We'll share the chili fries.

15:16.624 --> 15:19.835
And sea kelp moisturizer's up 50%.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.045
-All right!
-Nice!

15:21.128 --> 15:25.299
Guys, we've got to push
the spot-fading serums, though, right?

15:25.382 --> 15:27.718
Maybe they'd sell
if they didn't smell like ass.

15:27.801 --> 15:28.969
[men laughing]

15:30.179 --> 15:31.972
Active ingredients.

15:32.973 --> 15:34.391
Smell means what?

15:35.267 --> 15:36.310
It's working.

15:37.478 --> 15:39.897
Right. It's a joke.

15:40.773 --> 15:41.690
I like jokes.

15:42.608 --> 15:45.819
You know what else is a joke?
Your numbers.

15:47.655 --> 15:48.989
It's just one month.

15:49.073 --> 15:50.157
[Vance] Till it's two.

15:50.240 --> 15:54.995
Then three. Then four.
Then you're flat on your face.

15:55.079 --> 15:58.707
-I'm on it.
-What happens if he isn't on it, fellows?

15:58.791 --> 16:00.292
[men] We pick him up!

16:02.795 --> 16:05.172
-What's holding you back?
-Uh…

16:05.756 --> 16:07.591
Thing with Jules' mom again.

16:07.675 --> 16:09.593
How long does she want to stay this time?

16:09.677 --> 16:11.971
She bought a one-way ticket.

16:12.054 --> 16:13.722
[man] Oh, boy.

16:25.025 --> 16:27.569
-What's he got to do, fellows?
-[men] Stand up!

16:28.404 --> 16:31.699
[Vance] Evolution has given us
the ability to stand up.

16:32.574 --> 16:34.618
We stand up for our families.

16:35.327 --> 16:36.954
Stand up for our community.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.623
Stand up when we pee.

16:39.707 --> 16:41.750
It's not that easy.

16:42.793 --> 16:44.336
Then let's do it together.

16:48.549 --> 16:50.634
-[all applauding]
-[Brian] Good boy, Cory!

16:54.304 --> 16:56.807
Now, you go home
and you stand up to Jules.

16:56.890 --> 16:58.642
-Yeah.
-Strong sales!

16:58.726 --> 17:00.644
-[men] Strong hearts!
-Here we go.

17:01.395 --> 17:04.982
Dean. You put up
some solid numbers this week.

17:07.026 --> 17:07.901
Thanks.

17:09.278 --> 17:10.571
Let's keep it that way.

17:11.280 --> 17:12.781
What's going on with you?

17:15.784 --> 17:16.952
I'm fine.

17:17.494 --> 17:20.039
You don't get slapped with
an ankle bracelet by being fine.

17:22.541 --> 17:27.004
Look, I love selling the products.
Because they're great. It's just…

17:27.880 --> 17:30.007
You know, all this, it's just…

17:30.090 --> 17:31.800
not really my thing.

17:37.473 --> 17:39.099
All right, let's wrap it up, fellows.

17:39.183 --> 17:41.310
-Strong sales!
-[men] Strong hearts!

17:50.027 --> 17:50.944
Hey, Dean?

17:53.864 --> 17:56.033
-No pressure.
-Cool.

17:56.658 --> 17:58.410
Do you really want to make it here?

17:58.494 --> 17:59.912
I mean, yeah.

18:01.747 --> 18:04.541
Then you're gonna need
all the help you can get.

18:42.621 --> 18:44.832
[indistinct chatter on TV]

18:46.333 --> 18:47.376
Hi.

18:51.755 --> 18:52.673
Excuse me.

18:56.718 --> 19:00.222
Any idea where, uh, your friend is?

19:00.305 --> 19:01.890
You mean Kevin?

19:02.599 --> 19:04.268
Kevin. Thank you.

19:05.435 --> 19:08.105
Oh, hey. Uh, you're all out of shampoo.

19:09.148 --> 19:11.191
That was a brand-new bottle.

19:11.275 --> 19:14.444
Yeah. You know, we were all pretty gnarly.

19:19.158 --> 19:21.785
Can I speak with you outside for a moment?

19:22.536 --> 19:23.412
Yeah.

19:27.749 --> 19:30.294
-[Annie] I thought I said no parties.
-I know.

19:30.377 --> 19:32.004
What the hell is that?

19:33.005 --> 19:34.214
It's laundry club.

19:34.923 --> 19:35.924
That is not a thing.

19:36.508 --> 19:37.926
Well, not for the homed.

19:38.510 --> 19:41.138
Okay. You know what?
This is not gonna work.

19:41.221 --> 19:44.600
-[Kevin] It's only once a month.
-No. No. This.

19:44.683 --> 19:47.102
This. You here with us.

19:47.978 --> 19:50.272
Well, I have no place else to go.

19:50.355 --> 19:53.358
Can't you bunk with that old man?

19:53.442 --> 19:55.569
Oh, no, Murphy's super private.

19:55.652 --> 19:57.154
[Annie groans]

19:57.237 --> 19:59.448
It's just… It's too weird.

19:59.531 --> 20:01.450
Just give it a chance.

20:01.533 --> 20:03.285
It's too weird for my son.

20:04.161 --> 20:05.454
Well, I'm his guardian.

20:06.371 --> 20:07.706
On paper.

20:09.208 --> 20:10.209
[sighs]

20:12.336 --> 20:14.546
Yeah, all right. Fine.

20:16.965 --> 20:18.133
I'll, uh…

20:20.219 --> 20:21.595
I'll go get my stuff.

20:22.179 --> 20:23.388
Thank you.

20:23.472 --> 20:26.266
And, yeah, I'll let the school know.

20:26.350 --> 20:27.184
Whoa-ho.

20:27.893 --> 20:29.686
Let the school know what?

20:30.896 --> 20:33.899
I'm no longer your domestic partner.

20:35.275 --> 20:36.401
You can't do that.

20:36.485 --> 20:37.819
Well, I can't lie.

20:37.903 --> 20:39.321
I mean, you can.

20:39.404 --> 20:40.948
But I'm not gonna.

20:41.823 --> 20:43.408
It's for my kid.

20:43.492 --> 20:44.451
[Kevin] Sorry.

20:46.036 --> 20:47.454
It's just too weird.

20:51.667 --> 20:52.626
[sighs]

20:58.548 --> 21:00.926
[Annie] That woman
could only own a paper store.

21:01.760 --> 21:03.553
Mmm, I don't know.

21:04.554 --> 21:06.348
Name literally anything else.

21:06.431 --> 21:07.641
Christmas tree farm.

21:07.724 --> 21:08.892
Same diff.

21:08.976 --> 21:11.520
Or, like, a jam store in Vermont.

21:11.603 --> 21:14.731
I mean something
that wouldn't be in a Lifetime movie.

21:14.815 --> 21:16.775
Okay. Then, I don't know.

21:22.864 --> 21:24.283
Okay, let's go.

21:25.158 --> 21:27.577
We have a weird thing going on
with the neighbors.

21:27.661 --> 21:29.830
Yeah, so the quicker, the better.

21:29.913 --> 21:31.331
And quieter.

21:31.415 --> 21:33.292
We'd do it during business hours, but…

21:33.375 --> 21:35.836
The new model arrives in the morning, so…

21:35.919 --> 21:38.839
And we've really got to
hit the ground running, right?

21:38.922 --> 21:42.301
Yes, Mother's Day, graduation…
They're all right around the corner.

21:42.384 --> 21:43.427
Father's Day?

21:43.510 --> 21:44.720
Can't leave out the dads.

21:44.803 --> 21:46.096
Gonna stop you right there.

21:46.847 --> 21:47.723
We have cash.

21:48.307 --> 21:49.808
We're not doing this.

21:51.184 --> 21:52.394
A lot of cash.

21:52.978 --> 21:54.187
It's not the money.

21:54.730 --> 21:57.232
Okay, you know what?
I'll be real with you.

21:58.191 --> 22:00.193
We are straight-up stealing this thing.

22:01.236 --> 22:04.698
You don't need to know the why,
but know that our life depends on it.

22:04.781 --> 22:07.534
And you can waste time
with morality, that's fine.

22:07.617 --> 22:11.913
But just know that you are looking at
three mostly good moms

22:11.997 --> 22:13.540
who really need your help.

22:15.876 --> 22:18.378
We don't have a problem with any of that.

22:20.464 --> 22:22.090
Thing just won't fit.

22:22.174 --> 22:24.259
It's too big, won't go through the door.

22:27.512 --> 22:30.557
But if you've got anything
smaller you want to steal,

22:31.433 --> 22:32.726
we're cool with that.

22:38.815 --> 22:40.525
[Ruby] How did it get in here?

22:40.609 --> 22:43.070
[Annie] Maybe they built
the building around it.

22:45.197 --> 22:49.034
This ancient machine from Germany
was just sitting here.

22:49.910 --> 22:51.119
Maybe.

22:52.204 --> 22:53.330
In a field.

22:54.456 --> 22:55.290
Maybe.

22:55.373 --> 23:01.546
Until Dorothy stumbles upon it
and decides… card shop.

23:02.756 --> 23:03.799
Maybe.

23:03.882 --> 23:06.218
Someone must've
put it together piece by piece.

23:06.301 --> 23:07.594
Can't we find that guy?

23:07.677 --> 23:08.845
How?

23:09.429 --> 23:10.889
Well, who services it?

23:10.972 --> 23:12.307
-Repair guy.
-[Annie] Okay.

23:12.390 --> 23:13.642
So, we find that guy…

23:13.725 --> 23:15.018
Who knows Dorothy.

23:15.894 --> 23:18.355
Then can we just get somebody
who's, like, "handy"?

23:18.438 --> 23:19.356
At this hour?

23:19.940 --> 23:21.024
[Annie] There are apps.

23:21.108 --> 23:22.359
[Ruby] What, TaskRabbit?

23:22.943 --> 23:24.319
There are others.

23:25.403 --> 23:27.572
-What's it like inside there?
-Guys…

23:27.656 --> 23:30.492
Earth still round? Is the sky even blue?

23:30.575 --> 23:31.660
Dean.

23:34.079 --> 23:35.372
You think he could do it?

23:35.455 --> 23:37.582
He took apart our dishwasher last week.

23:37.666 --> 23:40.252
I guess this is kind of like an appliance.

23:40.335 --> 23:41.545
Would he?

23:45.215 --> 23:47.134
So, how do we convince him?

23:48.927 --> 23:50.095
Not we.

23:52.806 --> 23:53.765
<i>Honey, wake up.</i>

23:54.432 --> 23:56.017
-Come on.
-What's going on?

23:56.101 --> 23:57.686
Come on, we need your help.

23:57.769 --> 23:59.813
-Now?
-Yeah, can't wait. I'm sorry.

23:59.896 --> 24:01.982
-Is it the kids?
-No.

24:02.065 --> 24:03.191
Is it my mom?

24:03.275 --> 24:04.985
No. I need your toolbox.

24:05.068 --> 24:08.530
-Oh, it's the toilet again.
-No.

24:09.114 --> 24:10.532
[Dean] Well, what is it?

24:12.659 --> 24:13.869
Dean.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.084
No.

24:22.919 --> 24:23.837
Listen.

24:23.920 --> 24:25.130
No.

24:25.797 --> 24:28.133
This is the only way
we're gonna turn this around.

24:30.927 --> 24:32.512
How does helping him help me?

24:32.596 --> 24:36.391
If I keep him in business, he won't
notice what I'm doing on the side.

24:37.309 --> 24:39.436
What are you doing on the side now?

24:39.519 --> 24:41.146
I am saving up.

24:41.229 --> 24:42.814
For my lawyer?

24:42.898 --> 24:44.482
-To run.
-Where?

24:45.066 --> 24:47.819
I don't care,
as long as they can't find us.

24:50.238 --> 24:51.489
I'd rather have a lawyer.

24:51.573 --> 24:54.951
You would need the entire
bar association to save you now.

25:01.041 --> 25:02.250
I'll get my tools.

25:05.128 --> 25:07.422
["Laugh at Me" playing]

26:12.195 --> 26:13.738
[imperceptible]

26:42.058 --> 26:43.059
What?

26:45.645 --> 26:46.730
Um…

26:48.315 --> 26:49.858
Can you guys give us a minute?

26:50.608 --> 26:52.652
[Annie] But my pulp's gonna dry.

26:55.238 --> 26:56.906
Let's check out the pole.

27:06.750 --> 27:08.168
How's it going?

27:09.002 --> 27:10.420
It's almost there.

27:13.673 --> 27:14.716
Thank you.

27:16.301 --> 27:19.971
I never realized
what went into all of this.

27:21.514 --> 27:24.809
Yeah. I mean, it took a second
for us to find our groove.

27:24.893 --> 27:26.061
It's impressive.

27:28.980 --> 27:29.898
Yeah?

27:32.108 --> 27:34.903
And terrifying.

27:42.494 --> 27:43.370
Why?

27:43.995 --> 27:46.164
When we get to where we're going…

27:47.582 --> 27:49.501
how do I know he won't be there?

27:52.462 --> 27:54.464
I'm not gonna forward our mail.

27:54.547 --> 27:55.423
[Dean] Like…

27:56.007 --> 27:58.885
How do I know
he's not gonna be in your head?

28:00.387 --> 28:01.388
Because…

28:03.473 --> 28:05.558
he never belonged there
in the first place.

28:07.936 --> 28:09.437
And what about all this?

28:10.021 --> 28:10.897
What about it?

28:13.525 --> 28:15.068
What's gonna replace it?

28:19.948 --> 28:21.574
You and the kids.

28:24.828 --> 28:25.870
[Dean scoffs]

28:34.879 --> 28:36.423
Where are you going?

28:38.216 --> 28:41.177
We've never made you smile
like all this just did.

28:42.971 --> 28:45.765
-You have to finish.
-Why?

28:45.849 --> 28:47.934
Because, I told you.
This is what gets us out.

28:48.017 --> 28:49.936
No, that's what gets you off.

28:51.980 --> 28:54.733
This whole time,
I thought he was the problem.

28:59.070 --> 29:00.739
He's just the excuse.

29:12.208 --> 29:13.543
What's it look like?

29:13.626 --> 29:16.087
[Ruby] Even if we find it,
how will we put it together?

29:16.171 --> 29:19.174
We can figure out five pieces.
It's not like it's 50.

29:19.257 --> 29:21.009
Okay. Does it look like this?

29:21.092 --> 29:22.260
[Beth] Kind of.

29:22.343 --> 29:23.845
Okay. Or more like this?

29:25.930 --> 29:27.724
-Kind of.
-Just get both.

29:29.476 --> 29:30.518
Uh…

29:31.352 --> 29:33.271
Mmm. It's in Germany.

29:35.940 --> 29:37.650
You've got to talk to him.

29:38.902 --> 29:40.361
What's there to say anymore?

29:41.488 --> 29:42.697
What did you say to Stan?

29:44.491 --> 29:47.160
I just told him what he wanted to hear.

29:47.911 --> 29:49.204
Then, do the same.

29:51.498 --> 29:52.373
[Annie] Mmm.

29:53.041 --> 29:55.877
Really, really sucks to be you this week.

29:57.587 --> 29:58.755
Going… [exhales sharply]

30:00.924 --> 30:03.718
Hey, hey. What are you doing?

30:03.802 --> 30:05.470
Yo, this is super fly.

30:05.553 --> 30:06.596
That is not yours.

30:06.679 --> 30:09.015
Like the Tesla of lacrosse sticks.

30:09.098 --> 30:10.183
Give it back.

30:10.266 --> 30:11.476
[Kevin exclaims]

30:12.685 --> 30:14.521
-Score!
-Stop. Okay, that is enough.

30:14.604 --> 30:16.731
That's enough.
I can't take it anymore, okay?

30:16.815 --> 30:17.774
I'm relocating you.

30:18.566 --> 30:21.110
-Huh?
-Yeah. I'm gonna lease you a house.

30:23.279 --> 30:25.156
-For real?
-Yep.

30:25.240 --> 30:26.950
On wheels.

30:27.659 --> 30:30.286
See? It's got a shower and a foldout bed,

30:30.370 --> 30:33.039
and it gets 14 miles to the gallon,
and there's a stove.

30:33.122 --> 30:34.749
How can you afford that?

30:34.833 --> 30:35.917
I can't.

30:36.000 --> 30:39.504
But I also can't afford to have
my son be kicked out of his school.

30:40.630 --> 30:43.174
Ow. You want me out that bad.

30:43.925 --> 30:45.468
I never wanted you in.

30:49.347 --> 30:50.849
[Kevin clears throat]

30:51.891 --> 30:53.560
Well, uh…

30:55.979 --> 30:58.022
Yeah, if we're being honest…

30:58.898 --> 31:01.067
Please. [sighs]

31:02.652 --> 31:05.488
I kind of just assumed
he was a little dick.

31:06.865 --> 31:08.157
My son.

31:08.241 --> 31:12.036
You know, he goes to some
fancy-ass school.

31:12.954 --> 31:14.247
He has a bathroom.

31:15.456 --> 31:18.543
But, uh… And now that I've hung with him,

31:18.626 --> 31:21.713
he's, like, a regular dude.

31:22.422 --> 31:23.965
Thanks. I think.

31:25.592 --> 31:28.636
Yeah, that school could probably
use someone dope like him.

31:30.722 --> 31:32.891
That's why I've got to do
whatever it takes.

31:35.727 --> 31:36.811
[sighs]

31:38.855 --> 31:40.440
You know what? Just, uh…

31:41.482 --> 31:44.569
Yeah, you can forget about
the home on wheels.

31:47.697 --> 31:49.407
What are you gonna want instead?

31:50.116 --> 31:52.368
Oh, just keep him in lacrosse.

31:53.077 --> 31:56.497
You know, don't let him
become some theater kid.

31:57.790 --> 31:59.375
Where are you gonna live?

31:59.459 --> 32:00.835
With Murphy.

32:01.336 --> 32:03.379
I thought he was too private.

32:03.463 --> 32:07.258
I snagged him a refrigerator box
from Best Buy, so he owes me.

32:07.342 --> 32:08.593
Gotcha.

32:09.302 --> 32:10.178
[Kevin] Uh…

32:13.306 --> 32:15.183
Can I put on <i>Maddow</i> while I pack?

32:16.059 --> 32:17.143
Sure.

32:19.395 --> 32:21.689
[presenter speaking through TV]

32:26.945 --> 32:30.323
Corporate has given us
an extra 3% margin on all of these.

32:30.406 --> 32:31.491
-Cha-ching.
-[Vance] Yep.

32:31.574 --> 32:34.619
-Get them out there as fast as possible.
-Rosehips.

32:34.702 --> 32:37.830
Pair it with the Restorative Night Cream.
Great add-on.

32:37.914 --> 32:40.249
Do we use it before
or after the face wash?

32:40.333 --> 32:41.334
[Vance] I don't know.

32:41.417 --> 32:45.338
You're gonna wash off $90 face cream
right after you put it on?

32:45.421 --> 32:47.507
I robbed a greeting card store.

32:54.639 --> 32:55.765
What's that, Dean?

32:57.558 --> 32:59.185
I stole a printing press.

33:03.439 --> 33:05.400
Is that how you got the bracelet?

33:05.984 --> 33:07.068
That's…

33:08.987 --> 33:12.198
because my wife
was laundering a gang's money

33:12.281 --> 33:13.741
through my business.

33:16.577 --> 33:19.122
Yeah, but what did you need the press for?

33:21.082 --> 33:23.042
She uses it to make counterfeit.

33:31.884 --> 33:32.969
What happened to her?

33:37.390 --> 33:38.933
Not a damn thing.

33:40.560 --> 33:42.645
[Vance] And you're the one
in the bracelet.

33:46.315 --> 33:47.567
I owed her.

33:49.235 --> 33:50.611
That's a big-time debt.

33:54.073 --> 33:55.700
I messed up big-time.

33:57.660 --> 33:58.745
Girl at work?

34:00.747 --> 34:02.373
More than just one of them.

34:04.042 --> 34:05.209
[Vance] Still going on?

34:05.293 --> 34:07.003
God, no. It was forever ago.

34:09.380 --> 34:11.049
What's manslaughter get you, Z?

34:11.132 --> 34:14.677
Good behavior? Few years, tops.

34:14.761 --> 34:17.055
-I didn't murder anyone.
-[Vance] Exactly.

34:17.638 --> 34:20.099
You just put your penis in some strange.

34:20.183 --> 34:21.684
Human nature, bro.

34:21.768 --> 34:24.145
[Vance] People make mistakes.

34:26.856 --> 34:28.441
She doesn't feel that way.

34:29.859 --> 34:31.569
[Vance] Then you've got to let it go.

34:38.910 --> 34:40.453
I don't know that I can.

34:43.331 --> 34:46.334
-Johnny, give me the key.
-[Brian] All right.

34:46.417 --> 34:48.169
[men whooping and clapping]

34:49.087 --> 34:51.714
Come on. Come with me.
You've got to get up, buddy.

34:51.798 --> 34:53.257
Come on. Come on.

34:55.093 --> 34:56.803
Right over here. Right there.

34:58.012 --> 34:59.055
Get ready.

34:59.138 --> 35:00.264
[keys jangling]

35:04.060 --> 35:05.144
[Vance] Come on, Dean.

35:05.228 --> 35:07.271
Don't let her keep you behind those bars.

35:07.355 --> 35:09.398
Nope. Come on, buddy.

35:09.482 --> 35:11.776
-Do it.
-There you go. Come on.

35:11.859 --> 35:12.944
Uh-huh. Good boy.

35:13.027 --> 35:14.028
That's right.

35:18.116 --> 35:19.534
It's okay, it's okay.

35:19.617 --> 35:20.868
[man 3 exclaims]

35:20.952 --> 35:22.036
[man 4] Yeah!

35:23.704 --> 35:24.705
[man 5] Yeah.

35:33.589 --> 35:34.966
You're free.

35:37.260 --> 35:38.427
Free.

35:47.395 --> 35:48.563
Dad!

35:48.646 --> 35:50.481
[Dean] I'm in here, bud.

35:50.565 --> 35:52.608
[Danny] I got one goal and one assist.

35:52.692 --> 35:55.528
What? Nice!

35:55.611 --> 35:57.071
That's amazing.

35:57.864 --> 35:59.532
Come on. Go get in the bath.

36:06.455 --> 36:07.874
Tried to FaceTime you.

36:09.041 --> 36:10.376
I was busy.

36:17.466 --> 36:20.761
I can't promise you
that I won't get bored.

36:25.266 --> 36:26.225
Or…

36:28.686 --> 36:31.189
think it might be fun
to hit a grocery store again.

36:39.113 --> 36:40.740
But at least we'll have a shot.

36:44.368 --> 36:46.621
Because if we stay here,
nothing's gonna change.

36:54.420 --> 36:55.630
You can print.

36:56.964 --> 36:58.257
I finished it.

37:01.469 --> 37:02.470
Why?

37:05.681 --> 37:07.058
I just let it go.

37:20.905 --> 37:23.491
[Dean] D-man! Give me the recap!

37:29.497 --> 37:30.790
Braid emergency.

37:31.624 --> 37:33.125
So, you're just gonna take my job?

37:33.209 --> 37:35.920
-You weren't home.
-I got them.

37:36.003 --> 37:38.589
Work emergency trumps braid emergency.

37:38.673 --> 37:39.924
Let me see.

37:40.841 --> 37:42.218
That's not bad, right?

37:42.301 --> 37:44.845
I don't think Alicia Keys
will be calling you, but…

37:44.929 --> 37:46.430
Snoop might, though.

37:46.514 --> 37:48.057
So, now you do locks?

37:48.140 --> 37:49.517
You want to give it a go?

37:49.600 --> 37:50.810
I'm all good.

37:50.893 --> 37:52.270
[Stan chuckles]

37:57.024 --> 37:57.984
How did it go?

37:58.901 --> 38:01.153
Couple of speed bumps,
but we pulled it off.

38:01.237 --> 38:03.197
Okay. How long is it gonna take?

38:04.198 --> 38:06.242
Till we find somewhere else, I guess.

38:06.325 --> 38:09.578
The city will put that place
up for auction soon.

38:09.662 --> 38:10.997
What's soon?

38:11.080 --> 38:13.582
You'll know
when the sticker's on the door.

38:15.334 --> 38:16.294
[sighs]

38:22.341 --> 38:23.843
Thanks for making that work.

38:25.344 --> 38:26.846
I just gave you a key.

38:27.555 --> 38:28.848
I meant with her.

38:29.682 --> 38:30.683
[Stan] Mmm.

38:31.517 --> 38:32.935
Well, she's your girl.

38:34.312 --> 38:35.855
What did she say to you?

38:37.106 --> 38:38.858
Everything I wanted to hear.

38:38.941 --> 38:39.817
[chuckles]

38:41.277 --> 38:42.778
What? What's funny?

38:43.863 --> 38:46.282
She said the exact same thing to me.

38:46.365 --> 38:47.241
[Stan] Mmm.

38:53.414 --> 38:54.957
Hey. Where is he?

38:55.791 --> 38:57.877
-He's in the shower.
-[Annie] Oh, God.

38:59.545 --> 39:02.673
I got us all new peanut butter,

39:02.757 --> 39:07.136
mayo, mustard, and soy sauce.

39:08.888 --> 39:10.389
Where is he gonna go?

39:11.349 --> 39:14.101
To a lovely DIY duplex.

39:15.811 --> 39:17.605
I used his move today.

39:18.606 --> 39:20.524
-What do you mean?
-Rusty gate.

39:20.608 --> 39:22.860
-Ew!
-It's this really tough check.

39:22.943 --> 39:24.820
If you do it wrong, you get a penalty.

39:26.280 --> 39:28.532
Wait, hang on.
He taught you a lacrosse move?

39:28.616 --> 39:31.327
-He was All-American.
-What?

39:31.911 --> 39:33.120
Played for Maryland.

39:34.038 --> 39:37.208
Okay. Just need
five more minutes and I'm out.

39:38.793 --> 39:41.921
Oh, and hey, if you ever want to work
on more defense stuff,

39:42.004 --> 39:44.131
just come by the dumpster
behind the Kroger.

39:44.215 --> 39:46.592
-You still coming to the game?
-I wouldn't miss it.

39:49.220 --> 39:51.931
Unless I can't find
someone to watch my cart.

39:53.891 --> 39:54.725
Check.

39:54.809 --> 39:55.935
Ooh.

39:56.018 --> 39:58.020
Benjamin, nice reflexes.

40:00.898 --> 40:02.650
All right. [exhales]

40:03.192 --> 40:04.360
[Beth] <i>So, he's back in?</i>

40:04.443 --> 40:06.821
What do you want from me? I caved.

40:07.405 --> 40:08.781
What about that bucket?

40:11.075 --> 40:12.785
He held strong.

40:12.868 --> 40:14.870
-Dude.
-[Annie] Yeah.

40:17.373 --> 40:18.624
What's up, ladies?

40:19.917 --> 40:21.127
Just business.

40:29.927 --> 40:31.303
Knew you still got it.

40:32.263 --> 40:33.722
It wasn't easy.

40:33.806 --> 40:37.101
That maple leaf is, like,
four different colors.

40:37.685 --> 40:38.519
Cool.

40:39.603 --> 40:41.439
When do you want the rest of it?

40:44.316 --> 40:45.443
I don't.

40:49.071 --> 40:50.448
Why?

40:51.031 --> 40:53.325
My guys can't clean the Queen here.

40:55.786 --> 41:00.249
-You said all we had to do was print it.
-Yeah. And then drop it.

41:01.000 --> 41:05.254
I assumed that you meant in our country.

41:07.214 --> 41:08.883
Jesus, not again.

41:08.966 --> 41:11.218
[sighs] Why can't it ever be Mexico?

41:14.346 --> 41:15.264
When?

41:16.724 --> 41:18.017
When I'm ready.

41:22.396 --> 41:24.398
-Avoided it for so long.
-Don't…

41:24.482 --> 41:27.234
But I think
we all knew this day would come.

41:27.818 --> 41:29.570
It's like you want it to happen.

41:29.653 --> 41:31.322
I'm just saying.

41:31.405 --> 41:33.616
You stay in the game long enough,

41:33.699 --> 41:36.035
something's bound to wind up in your ass.
