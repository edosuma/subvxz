WEBVTT

00:02.524 --> 00:05.005
[music]

00:34.295 --> 00:37.515
Guys, it might be
because I'm The Easter Bunny

00:37.559 --> 00:43.956
but uh, I tell you Easter is my
absolute favorite time of year.

00:44.000 --> 00:49.919
In fact, it's safe to say I
count down 364 days to get to it

00:49.962 --> 00:52.704
each and every year.

00:52.748 --> 00:54.750
Tell us something
we don't know Benny

00:54.793 --> 00:58.058
but for the record I
think I can speak for Henrietta

00:58.101 --> 01:00.930
when I say we agree
with you a hundred percent.

01:00.973 --> 01:04.716
No doubt. This is going
to be the best Easter ever.

01:04.760 --> 01:06.675
You say that every year, Hen.

01:06.718 --> 01:09.460
That doesn't make it
any less true, Cosmo.

01:09.504 --> 01:13.856
Easter's the number one
Holiday, hands down.

01:13.899 --> 01:15.597
Everybody knows that.

01:15.640 --> 01:19.949
Nah-ah, I bet Santa Claus
would differ with you on that

01:19.992 --> 01:24.040
but, but I sure won't.
Easter forever!

01:26.521 --> 01:29.306
[Bad Clyde] Ah, this is it.
Another Easter

01:29.350 --> 01:33.049
and you know what makes this one
different than all the others.

01:33.093 --> 01:37.358
Everybody's gonna be oh so happy
to get painted Easter eggs

01:37.401 --> 01:39.534
while we get nothing.

01:39.577 --> 01:41.753
Our whole country side is

01:41.797 --> 01:43.973
gonna smell like rotten eggs

01:44.016 --> 01:45.931
after all those
Easter egg hunts.

01:45.975 --> 01:49.196
Good guesses both of you,
FrizzleBun and Frizzlebat,

01:49.239 --> 01:53.330
but no this year's Easter's
gonna be a whole lot different

01:53.374 --> 01:57.421
because of one
small detail [chuckles].

01:57.465 --> 02:03.079
It's gonna be completely
ruined. [laughs] That's right.

02:03.123 --> 02:06.735
With your help I'll accomplish
my most sinister plot yet.

02:06.778 --> 02:10.260
I'm gonna turn Easter
into a horrible time

02:10.304 --> 02:11.827
everybody's gonna hate

02:11.870 --> 02:15.091
and that will be
the end of Easter.

02:15.135 --> 02:18.964
So you're saying
E-- Easter will suck eggs?

02:19.008 --> 02:21.053
But, Bad Clyde,
we've been trying

02:21.097 --> 02:23.055
to ruin this
pesky Easter Holiday

02:23.099 --> 02:25.406
for a thousand years.

02:25.449 --> 02:27.669
Ugh, what makes
this year different?

02:27.712 --> 02:30.193
I'll tell you
my dear, Frizzlebuns.

02:30.237 --> 02:33.762
Feast your beady little eyes
on the magical talisman

02:33.805 --> 02:36.721
that's going to
change Easter forever.

02:38.984 --> 02:42.858
Uh, oh, what--
what am I looking at?

02:42.901 --> 02:45.600
Yeah, what are we
looking at, Bad Clyde?

02:45.643 --> 02:48.994
-But there's
there's nothing there.
-Think again.

02:49.038 --> 02:51.780
I'm thinking,
but I'm not seeing.

02:51.823 --> 02:54.826
You two lucky fellas
are staring right through

02:54.870 --> 02:59.048
The Great Invisible
Easter Egg of Muffet Land.

02:59.091 --> 03:01.355
The... Oh... the what?

03:01.398 --> 03:05.097
The Great Invisible Easter
Egg of Muffet Land [laughs].

03:05.141 --> 03:09.667
Of course, I've heard of it,
but I had never seen it before.

03:09.711 --> 03:13.715
I'm still not seeing it
because it's-- it's not there.

03:13.758 --> 03:17.762
It is, you bonehead.
Right before your very eyes.

03:17.806 --> 03:19.068
Nope not seeing it.

03:19.111 --> 03:23.594
Argh. Anyway if I may go on.

03:23.638 --> 03:27.207
This object holds
great and mighty powers.

03:27.250 --> 03:30.732
Powers that will at
the very least, ruin Easter

03:30.775 --> 03:34.692
for all those annoying
children around the world.

03:34.736 --> 03:36.912
And at the very most?

03:36.955 --> 03:39.436
At the very most, huh,

03:39.480 --> 03:43.484
it'll get rid of that pesky
Easter Bunny forever.

03:43.527 --> 03:45.790
That sounds delectable, boss.

03:45.834 --> 03:48.663
[laughs] Uh, how does it work?

03:48.706 --> 03:51.187
Still not seeing it.

03:51.231 --> 03:55.713
Well, Frizzlebat,
The Great Invisible Easter Egg
of Muffet Land

03:55.757 --> 03:59.804
works much the same
as a crystal ball.

03:59.848 --> 04:05.375
That is a crystal ball
with bad intentions [laughs].

04:05.419 --> 04:07.421
Instead of foreseeing events

04:07.464 --> 04:13.340
my new invisible talisman
leaves the foresight to its user

04:13.383 --> 04:17.648
and instead makes
whatever it is imagined, real.

04:17.692 --> 04:21.522
Wow! What do you plan
to do with it, Clyde?

04:21.565 --> 04:23.959
Excellent question, Frizzlebat.

04:24.002 --> 04:27.702
I intend to banish our old
friend Benny The Easter Bunny

04:27.745 --> 04:29.965
to The Land of
the Holiday Misfits

04:30.008 --> 04:32.924
from whence
nobody has ever returned.

04:32.968 --> 04:36.101
Brrr! I hate that place.

04:37.102 --> 04:41.063
Scary, dreary,
he-he, no fun at all.

04:41.106 --> 04:45.720
If that egg actually existed
it would be the best thing
that could happen to Easter.

04:45.763 --> 04:50.855
But, Bad Clyde, no, uh
Easter Bunny means
no Easter right?

04:50.899 --> 04:54.903
I never said there'd be no more
Easter. Did I, Frizzlebuns?

04:54.946 --> 04:59.211
But if, uh, if
Benny The Easter Bunny
gets banished

04:59.255 --> 05:03.041
to The Land of the Holiday
Misfits forever, then who is--

05:03.085 --> 05:07.132
You are looking at
the new Easter mascot.

05:07.176 --> 05:09.396
You are planning
to take Benny's place?

05:09.439 --> 05:13.356
I am [laughs].
I will take his place

05:13.400 --> 05:17.229
and crown myself
as the new Easter King.

05:17.273 --> 05:20.842
As King, I'll be
in charge of the Easter holidays

05:20.885 --> 05:25.673
and mark my words, all
those Easter morning smiles

05:25.716 --> 05:27.762
will turn to tears [laughs].

05:27.805 --> 05:32.506
[sinister laughter continues
and eagle shrieks in distance]

05:32.549 --> 05:34.856
But, but, but, Bad Clyde. I uh--

05:34.899 --> 05:36.118
What is it, Frizzlebuns?

05:36.161 --> 05:38.076
You can't beat The Easter Bunny.

05:38.120 --> 05:41.210
He may be cute
and all, but he's very powerful.

05:41.253 --> 05:43.125
Especially
considering I can't even see

05:43.168 --> 05:45.519
The Great Invisible
Easter Egg of Muffet Land.

05:45.562 --> 05:49.566
I am much more powerful
than that fluffy bag of carrots.

05:49.610 --> 05:51.699
I still don't see no egg.

05:51.742 --> 05:54.702
Fine. You'll
experience the powers of

05:54.745 --> 05:58.488
The Great Invisible Easter
Egg of Muffet Land for yourself.

05:58.532 --> 06:03.450
From dark and dismal Land
of the Holiday Misfits, be gone!

06:04.929 --> 06:09.673
Wow! [laughs] Did you really
just send Frizzlebuns

06:09.717 --> 06:11.327
to The Land of
the Holiday Misfits?

06:11.371 --> 06:13.547
I did indeed, Frizzlebat,

06:13.590 --> 06:17.986
but don't worry, he'll
send us a postcard [laughs].

06:18.029 --> 06:20.945
How about you?
Do you believe I possess

06:20.989 --> 06:24.558
the power of The Great Invisible
Easter Egg of Muffet Land?

06:24.601 --> 06:26.429
Yep. Yes, I do.

06:26.473 --> 06:28.779
Good. This was just a tune-up.

06:28.823 --> 06:32.479
Now to prepare
the egg for its real work.

06:32.522 --> 06:35.525
Getting rid of
Benny The Easter Bunny
once and for all.

06:35.569 --> 06:38.789
Can't wait, boss.
I just can't wait.

06:38.833 --> 06:41.836
Glad to hear that,
That makes two of us.

06:41.879 --> 06:43.838
Come, times a wastin'.

06:43.881 --> 06:46.449
[wind howling]

06:46.493 --> 06:50.018
Ho-ho, ah, I'm
quite bummed, Gargaff.

06:50.061 --> 06:53.021
Why, Santa? Did the naughty
boys and girls give you

06:53.064 --> 06:54.370
extra trouble this year?

06:54.414 --> 06:57.417
Well, they're no picnic either

06:57.460 --> 07:01.246
but really it's
because of the Easter holidays.

07:01.290 --> 07:03.858
Why? What's there
not to like about Easter?

07:03.901 --> 07:08.602
Because it means our
Christmas season is long over

07:08.645 --> 07:12.910
and it'll still be months
before it comes back around.

07:12.954 --> 07:16.261
Oh, yeah.
I see your point [sighs].

07:16.305 --> 07:19.351
What a drag. Nobody needs us.

07:19.395 --> 07:23.312
What on earth will we do for uh,

07:24.269 --> 07:27.272
seven months and 24 days?

07:27.316 --> 07:28.926
[both sigh]

07:28.970 --> 07:30.493
[gentle music]

07:31.712 --> 07:35.585
I got it, Santa. Why don't we,
oh-okay follow me here,

07:35.629 --> 07:37.413
celebrate Easter?

07:37.457 --> 07:41.330
Ho-ho-ho-ho.
Gargaff, my trusty reindeer

07:41.373 --> 07:45.595
you're always a ray
of sunshine through the snow.

07:45.639 --> 07:47.902
That's what I'm here for.
Well, that and keeping us

07:47.945 --> 07:50.208
on schedule
on the big day, eh? [laughs].

07:50.252 --> 07:53.516
Indeed, but do tell me more.

07:53.560 --> 07:55.431
Why don't we just relax,

07:55.475 --> 07:57.564
meet up with
Benny The Easter Bunny

07:57.607 --> 08:01.524
go on Easter egg hunts and enjoy
one of those
good Easter dinners?

08:01.568 --> 08:05.049
Mm, with all the trimmings?

08:05.093 --> 08:07.922
With all the trimmings.

08:07.965 --> 08:10.577
By George, Gargaff,
you're right.

08:10.620 --> 08:14.406
Ah, don't mention it.
Uh, wait who's George?

08:14.450 --> 08:17.584
Hey, you're not thinking
of pairing me up with
a partner again, are you?

08:17.627 --> 08:22.066
If I said it once,
I've said it a thousand times,
I work best alone.

08:22.110 --> 08:25.766
Or, you know, with one partner.
A jolly partner with
a big beard and loud--

08:25.809 --> 08:30.161
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho.
Relax Gargaff.

08:30.205 --> 08:33.643
You're the one
and only reindeer I need.

08:33.687 --> 08:36.472
Say, my belly growls

08:36.516 --> 08:38.909
just thinking
about that Easter feast.

08:38.953 --> 08:40.694
But you know

08:40.737 --> 08:44.393
we still have
a whole 'nother day

08:44.436 --> 08:46.787
before anyone's
going to sit down

08:46.830 --> 08:49.050
to enjoy an Easter dinner.

08:49.093 --> 08:50.573
What should we do then?

08:50.617 --> 08:52.532
How about some adventuring?

08:52.575 --> 08:55.360
Uh-oh. I've heard
you talk like this before.

08:55.404 --> 08:57.319
Remember
the Antarctica incident?

08:57.362 --> 09:00.496
Well, perhaps not
that much adventuring.

09:00.540 --> 09:04.587
I admit that was
a tad too wild [laughs].

09:04.631 --> 09:06.937
Even for my standards.

09:06.981 --> 09:08.852
Phew. Glad to hear that.

09:08.896 --> 09:10.593
I'm not much for big adventures.

09:10.637 --> 09:13.596
Especially if they
come with heaps of danger.

09:13.640 --> 09:17.295
But, ho-ho, a little adventure

09:17.339 --> 09:19.950
keeps you young
and on your toes.

09:19.994 --> 09:22.170
On my hooves, you mean [laughs].

09:22.213 --> 09:25.303
You know who could help us
pick up some adventure?

09:25.347 --> 09:27.175
My good pal, Babu.

09:27.218 --> 09:30.265
Babu! If anyone knows
how to get Santa

09:30.308 --> 09:32.615
and his reindeer
in trouble, it's Babu.

09:32.659 --> 09:34.922
That's the last
creature I wanna see.

09:34.965 --> 09:38.578
Now, now, Gargaff.
Let's just go
to see my old friend.

09:38.621 --> 09:40.797
We can only get in trouble

09:40.841 --> 09:43.539
if trouble is
what we're looking for.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.019
Oh, that's reassuring.

09:46.716 --> 09:50.372
Ho-ho, well, well.
As fate would have it

09:50.415 --> 09:53.593
look where we are.
Babu's homeland.

09:54.506 --> 09:55.943
I was hoping you two showed up.

09:55.986 --> 10:00.208
Babu. How are you old friend?

10:00.251 --> 10:04.038
I'm fine, but Benny the Easter
Bunny is not doing so great.

10:04.081 --> 10:08.259
He's in a world of trouble
and only we can help him.

10:08.303 --> 10:10.087
What happened?

10:10.131 --> 10:13.047
Nothing yet but, but,
something is bound to happen.

10:13.090 --> 10:14.352
Whatever do you mean?

10:14.396 --> 10:16.485
Bad Clyde is at it again.

10:16.528 --> 10:18.966
He's hatched a plan
to take Easter from Benny,

10:19.009 --> 10:21.882
and ruin the day
for kids everywhere.

10:21.925 --> 10:25.059
Oh, ho-ho-ho, no!

10:25.102 --> 10:29.803
-Bad Clyde, he can't
do that. Can he?
-I'm afraid so, Gargaff.

10:29.846 --> 10:33.676
This time Bad Clyde
has serious power on his side.

10:33.720 --> 10:36.984
The power of The Great
Invisible Easter Egg
of Muffet Land.

10:37.027 --> 10:40.204
The Great Invisible
Easter Egg of Muffet Land.

10:40.248 --> 10:41.379
Sounds like trouble.

10:41.423 --> 10:42.685
Tell us, Babu,

10:42.729 --> 10:46.080
what's Bad Clyde's plan?

10:46.123 --> 10:48.343
Well, let me tell you
from the beginning.

10:49.561 --> 10:52.173
[Babu] Somehow, Bad Clyde
has come into possession

10:52.216 --> 10:55.306
of The Great Invisible
Easter Egg of Muffet Land

10:55.350 --> 10:57.308
and its powers can end Easter

10:57.352 --> 11:00.703
as we know it for all time.

11:00.747 --> 11:06.448
Mm, this Great Invisible
Easter Egg of Muffet Land

11:06.491 --> 11:10.495
sounds downright
dangerous, ho-ho-ho.

11:10.539 --> 11:13.411
It is. Last time it
was used by a wicked troll

11:13.455 --> 11:16.893
to turn Halloween
from a feel-good Holiday
of sweetest pie elves

11:16.937 --> 11:18.982
delivering candy
to all good children.

11:19.026 --> 11:22.682
To the dark and spooky
holiday we know today?

11:22.725 --> 11:27.121
Full of ghosts and ghouls
and scary creatures of all kind?

11:27.164 --> 11:29.514
Yes, that is so.

11:29.558 --> 11:34.519
-Oh, gee, I wouldn't want that
to ever happen to Christmas.
-Or Easter.

11:34.563 --> 11:38.262
So the powers of The Great
Invisible Easter Egg
of Muffet Land

11:38.306 --> 11:41.918
-a-- are real?
-They are.

11:41.962 --> 11:44.225
The Great Egg gives
anyone who possesses it

11:44.268 --> 11:46.793
supernatural powers

11:46.836 --> 11:48.838
that can be used for good.

11:48.882 --> 11:50.318
Or for evil.

11:50.361 --> 11:52.755
That's right,
and knowing Bad Clyde

11:52.799 --> 11:58.587
He-- he-- he will use
these powers to wreak havoc
upon this land and Easter.

11:58.630 --> 12:00.458
There's no time to spare.

12:00.502 --> 12:03.679
We must find Benny
The Easter Bunny at once,

12:03.723 --> 12:05.376
and warn him.

12:05.420 --> 12:07.770
If I may make
a suggestion, Santa.

12:07.814 --> 12:10.991
I say we hightail it
back to the North Pole, stat!

12:11.948 --> 12:15.778
Some good old relaxation,
a massage-- [chuckles]

12:15.822 --> 12:18.868
Maybe a mud mask?
Until work picks up in December.

12:18.912 --> 12:20.391
Sounds just peachy to me.

12:20.435 --> 12:23.220
Not so fast, Gargaff. Ho-ho.

12:23.264 --> 12:28.791
If Benny really is in danger,
it's our duty to warn him.

12:28.835 --> 12:31.881
It's our duty to deliver
presents on Christmas morning.

12:31.925 --> 12:33.927
Battling loonies with
invisible magical weapons

12:33.970 --> 12:36.799
is for someone else
like Babu here.

12:36.843 --> 12:38.670
Babu, you can
handle that, right?

12:38.714 --> 12:41.848
Well, let's see, yeah, no.

12:41.891 --> 12:43.501
I think you guys have the edge.

12:43.545 --> 12:46.113
It's up to us to stop Bad Clyde

12:46.156 --> 12:49.594
-and save Easter.
-Why don't we think it through.

12:49.638 --> 12:52.728
I mean, why rush off
into the wild unknown?

12:53.598 --> 12:55.862
Taking on Bad Clyde and his
Easter Egg of Muffet Land

12:55.905 --> 12:58.342
sounds like a scary proposition.

12:58.386 --> 13:03.043
Gargaff you forget,
I'm Santa Claus

13:03.086 --> 13:06.133
and you're my trusty
right-hand reindeer

13:06.176 --> 13:08.570
and we are a fearless team

13:08.613 --> 13:11.616
always on the side of justice.

13:11.660 --> 13:14.445
Oh boy, here goes Santa.

13:14.489 --> 13:17.448
I've seen him like this before.
Which means we're gonna get

13:17.492 --> 13:20.060
into all sorts of wild
and dangerous adventures.

13:20.103 --> 13:22.453
And there is no telling
how it will all end.

13:22.497 --> 13:25.456
That's what I was
hoping for, Gargaff.

13:25.500 --> 13:27.023
That makes one of us.

13:27.067 --> 13:29.112
On with the mission, Gargaff.

13:29.156 --> 13:32.637
Away in a flash.

13:33.595 --> 13:37.294
You know, Henrietta, no matter
how many Easters we enjoy,

13:37.338 --> 13:39.862
it never gets old.

13:39.906 --> 13:42.909
Our holiday is
the best holiday around.

13:42.952 --> 13:45.433
And it's an honor to work it
with an Easter Bunny

13:45.476 --> 13:47.696
as awesome as you are, Benny.

13:47.739 --> 13:50.481
Oh my. Am-- am I blushing?

13:50.525 --> 13:52.309
You flatter me.

13:52.353 --> 13:55.747
[clucks and laughs]
You're so modest.

13:55.791 --> 13:58.489
Benny, you make
so many children happy

13:58.533 --> 14:01.101
even if it's
just one day a year.

14:01.144 --> 14:03.755
That one day is full of memories

14:03.799 --> 14:05.975
that lasts lifetimes.

14:06.019 --> 14:09.936
Hey, I-- I just enjoy seeing
all of them smiles

14:09.979 --> 14:11.676
on the kids' faces.

14:11.720 --> 14:13.069
That's what I'm in it for.

14:13.113 --> 14:15.289
Well, if I've
never told you before

14:15.332 --> 14:17.465
I'm just happy to help.

14:17.508 --> 14:20.033
You're the best
bunny boss I could ask for.

14:24.254 --> 14:27.910
I only hope we can reach
Benny The Easter Bunny in time

14:27.954 --> 14:31.174
to deter
Bad Clyde's crazy plans.

14:31.218 --> 14:35.787
With all due respect, Santa
I had a feeling when you said
you wanted to see Babu

14:35.831 --> 14:38.747
that we'd find ourselves in
some kind of crazy adventure

14:38.790 --> 14:41.271
and on the eve of Easter
nonetheless.

14:41.315 --> 14:45.145
Oh, boy, I was planning to kick
my hooves up by the fire tonight

14:45.188 --> 14:48.670
and enjoy a mug or two
of Mrs. Claus's
world famous hot chocolate.

14:48.713 --> 14:51.934
-Mm
-Aho-ho-ho-ho-hoo!

14:51.978 --> 14:54.763
I'd almost forgotten
Mrs. Claus's

14:54.806 --> 14:56.634
hot chocolate myself.

14:56.678 --> 14:59.202
Gargaff old boy, tell you what.

14:59.246 --> 15:01.291
As soon as we warn Benny

15:01.335 --> 15:03.337
and thwart Bad Clyde,

15:03.380 --> 15:05.687
we'll head back
to the North Pole

15:05.730 --> 15:09.125
and pour ourselves
as many mugs as we want.

15:09.169 --> 15:10.692
How's that sound?

15:10.735 --> 15:13.782
[foreboding music
and eagle shrieks]

15:13.825 --> 15:15.305
This is it, Frizzlebat

15:15.349 --> 15:19.005
the realization
of a lifelong dream.

15:19.048 --> 15:20.484
I will be

15:20.528 --> 15:23.705
the King of Easter.

15:23.748 --> 15:26.447
And once King,
you will turn Easter

15:26.490 --> 15:30.451
into the worst
holiday of all [laughs].

15:30.494 --> 15:33.193
That's right.
All that needs doing now

15:33.236 --> 15:35.847
is to recite
the magic incantation

15:35.891 --> 15:39.764
then we'll be rid of
that pesky Easter Bunny forever.

15:39.808 --> 15:41.375
[laughs]

15:42.245 --> 15:44.247
I can't believe it, boss.

15:44.291 --> 15:47.033
I never thought I'd see the day.

15:47.076 --> 15:50.123
No more Easter Bunny.

15:50.166 --> 15:53.604
The day is here,
my trusty Frizzlebat.

15:53.648 --> 15:56.651
[chuckles] Let's make
it happen [chuckles].

15:56.694 --> 15:59.871
Recite the magic incantation,
Bad Clyde.

15:59.915 --> 16:04.833
[clears his throat] O Forces of
darkness opposed to the light.

16:04.876 --> 16:08.619
O Powers of pain.
O Bearers of fright.

16:08.663 --> 16:11.927
Deliver this subject
by day or by night.

16:11.971 --> 16:15.148
The Bunny named Benny
who gives me the fits.

16:15.191 --> 16:18.890
Banish him to The Land
of the Holiday Misfits.

16:19.761 --> 16:23.895
Benny, look,
is that Santa Claus?

16:23.939 --> 16:26.594
Hm, It sure is.

16:26.637 --> 16:28.639
What's he doing out
this time of year?

16:28.683 --> 16:30.206
I don't know.

16:32.078 --> 16:35.081
Benny, we need to talk.

16:35.124 --> 16:38.693
What is it, Santa?
What's the ruckus about?

16:38.736 --> 16:41.043
[magical sound]

16:41.087 --> 16:43.350
Hey, where did they go?

16:43.393 --> 16:46.353
Oh, no. Ho, ho, ho.

16:46.396 --> 16:49.182
Bad Clyde's incantation worked.

16:49.225 --> 16:51.488
We're too late, Gargaff.

16:51.532 --> 16:54.100
Easter is lost.

16:54.143 --> 16:56.711
[wind blowing]

16:59.105 --> 17:02.630
For parsnips sake,
what just happened?

17:02.673 --> 17:04.936
I'm not sure.

17:04.980 --> 17:07.461
Where in the world
are we, Benny?

17:10.594 --> 17:13.075
I don't think you're
in the world anymore.

17:13.119 --> 17:15.817
At least any world
you're familiar with.

17:15.860 --> 17:19.908
Frizzlebuns, what's the meaning
of this? Where's Bad Clyde?

17:19.951 --> 17:23.912
Yeah, where he goes, you're
sure to follow right behind.

17:23.955 --> 17:27.002
He's not here.
I'm here all alone.

17:27.046 --> 17:29.787
Where is here?

17:29.831 --> 17:32.529
Welcome to The Land of
the Holiday Misfits, fellas.

17:32.573 --> 17:37.534
-Dreary, scary,
and downright gloomy.
-[both] No.

17:37.578 --> 17:40.798
I know, and we're
never to return whence we came.

17:42.104 --> 17:43.932
Such is
the nature of this place.

17:43.975 --> 17:47.631
Sorcery, how is this possible?

17:47.675 --> 17:50.460
Easy. Bad Clyde got his mitts,

17:50.504 --> 17:53.768
on The Great Invisible Easter
Egg of Muffet Land. That's how.

17:53.811 --> 17:58.512
The Great Invisible...
It's real?

17:58.555 --> 18:01.036
I thought it was
just a children's fable.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.430
I did too
and look where it got me.

18:03.473 --> 18:05.606
But you're usually

18:05.649 --> 18:10.306
in cahoots with Clyde.
Why are you here?

18:10.350 --> 18:13.570
I dared question his powers
and then now here I am,

18:13.614 --> 18:15.790
in The Land of
the Holiday Misfits.

18:15.833 --> 18:19.576
Frizzlebuns, is there a way
out of here or are we trapped?

18:19.620 --> 18:21.883
Yeah, can we get back home?

18:21.926 --> 18:25.234
For all intents
and purposes we're trapped but--

18:25.278 --> 18:28.150
-But?
-But?

18:28.194 --> 18:33.068
There is one way, but I don't
know of anyone ever
trying it successfully.

18:33.112 --> 18:36.115
What is it? What's the one way?

18:36.158 --> 18:39.988
You gotta find the elusive
Great King of The Land of
Holiday Misfits.

18:40.031 --> 18:42.991
The Great King
of The Land of Holiday Misfits,

18:43.034 --> 18:45.863
well he can't
be too hard to find.

18:45.907 --> 18:48.170
Hold on, rabbit ears,
that ain't all.

18:48.214 --> 18:50.781
Once you find him,
if you find him,

18:50.825 --> 18:54.959
you gotta convince him to grant
your request to leave
The Land of Holiday Misfits.

18:55.003 --> 18:58.354
That's it? We just have
to convince him to let us go?

18:58.398 --> 19:00.878
That doesn't sound too hard.

19:00.922 --> 19:02.880
Yeah well, huh,
good luck with that.

19:02.924 --> 19:07.189
I hear he can't stand birds,
they poop all over his subjects.

19:07.233 --> 19:11.062
[clucking]
Oh, for all the eggs of Easter,

19:11.106 --> 19:13.935
I make a point
to look before I poop.

19:13.978 --> 19:17.591
And he can't stand bunnies
as they hop all over
his vegetable garden.

19:17.634 --> 19:21.290
We'll just have to
make sure he likes us.

19:21.334 --> 19:23.640
And if I see a vegetable garden,

19:23.684 --> 19:25.860
I'll make sure I tiptoe
around it [chuckles].

19:25.903 --> 19:28.645
Now, let's go find the King.

19:28.689 --> 19:32.997
You'll never find him.
This land is as wide
as it is dreary.

19:33.041 --> 19:34.390
Any ideas where to look?

19:34.434 --> 19:36.218
Ha, you think I'd tell you?

19:36.262 --> 19:38.699
I'd already be back
talking to him on my own

19:38.742 --> 19:42.311
trying to get back to my bad
deeds if I knew where he was.

19:42.355 --> 19:45.271
Of course you would,
you after all,

19:45.314 --> 19:49.492
-are one of Bad Clyde's minions.
-You best know it.

19:49.536 --> 19:52.887
Say, how about
you come with us, Frizzlebuns,

19:52.930 --> 19:55.803
stick together, the three of us.

19:55.846 --> 20:00.286
Why would you offer to help me,
Fluffball? We're enemies.

20:00.329 --> 20:02.418
We're not enemies, Frizzlebuns.

20:02.462 --> 20:04.290
You're just Bad Clyde's
evil minion [chuckles].

20:04.333 --> 20:07.728
But there's no reason
we can't be friends.

20:07.771 --> 20:11.253
Ew! No, I won't.
I'm a bad Frizzlebuns,

20:11.297 --> 20:14.735
and bad Frizzlebuns
don't make friends
with Easter Bunnies.

20:14.778 --> 20:19.609
Suit yourself, Frizzlebuns.
Just remember, the offer stands.

20:19.653 --> 20:22.612
I think I'd rather
eat dirt and drink rainwater.

20:22.656 --> 20:23.918
Scram, rodent.

20:23.961 --> 20:25.441
Have it your way.

20:25.485 --> 20:27.095
Don't worry, I will.

20:27.138 --> 20:30.620
Let's go, Benny.
Our help is not appreciated.

20:31.665 --> 20:33.319
We blew it, Gargaff.

20:33.362 --> 20:35.538
This was an absolutely

20:35.582 --> 20:39.063
ho-ho-hoorrible turn of events.

20:39.107 --> 20:40.543
Our good friend Benny

20:40.587 --> 20:43.851
is gone, perhaps forever

20:43.894 --> 20:45.548
and Easter itself

20:45.592 --> 20:48.203
is in dire straits.

20:48.247 --> 20:51.119
Oh shucks, Santa.
That's a bummer.

20:51.162 --> 20:53.208
I feel as if I could
have done something more.

20:53.252 --> 20:55.819
There, there, my good Gargaff.

20:55.863 --> 20:57.908
This is no fault of yours.

20:57.952 --> 20:59.997
Thanks. I think.

21:00.041 --> 21:03.436
We tried our best,
but we're up against

21:03.479 --> 21:07.788
powerful forces of evil
outside our control.

21:07.831 --> 21:13.184
This is all the doing
of one very wicked individual,

21:13.228 --> 21:15.099
Bad Clyde!

21:15.143 --> 21:17.580
Oh Santa, what can we do?

21:17.624 --> 21:21.410
There is only one who might
be able to help us now.

21:21.454 --> 21:23.282
Who is it? Speak, Santa.

21:23.325 --> 21:25.327
Make that white beard
flap at once, my gosh,

21:25.371 --> 21:27.329
I must know who can help us.

21:27.373 --> 21:32.160
The only inter-dimensional
magical peacemaker I know.

21:32.203 --> 21:34.510
Balthazar The Magician.

21:34.554 --> 21:36.207
Balthazar The Magician?

21:36.251 --> 21:38.079
But his homeland
is the most treacherous terrain

21:38.122 --> 21:39.689
this side of Dark-Like mountain.

21:39.733 --> 21:42.736
Yes, I know, but I'm afraid

21:42.779 --> 21:44.651
we've no choice, Gargaff.

21:44.694 --> 21:47.349
It's either that or say goodbye

21:47.393 --> 21:49.873
to our dear friends forever.

21:49.917 --> 21:51.005
And Easter.

21:51.048 --> 21:52.659
And Easter.

21:52.702 --> 21:55.357
-And chocolate eggs?
-And chocolate eggs.

21:55.401 --> 21:58.491
-And Easter dinner?
-And Easter dinner.

21:58.534 --> 22:02.146
[sighs] Balthazar
The Magician it is then.

22:02.190 --> 22:06.412
That's my reindeer, ho-ho-ho.
Off we go.

22:06.455 --> 22:08.414
I knew I should've
stayed in bed today.

22:09.763 --> 22:14.245
Frizzlebat, now that
Benny The Easter Bunny
is out of the picture,

22:14.289 --> 22:18.380
our next move
is to take over his lair.

22:18.424 --> 22:23.907
Wow! [laughs] A downright
Shakespearean plan, boss!

22:23.951 --> 22:27.955
We don't have to shake
our spears at anything,
Frizzlebat.

22:27.998 --> 22:29.826
We have the mighty egg

22:29.870 --> 22:33.395
and the egg is all powerful.

22:33.439 --> 22:37.747
I-I meant Shakespeare.
The uh, the-- you know,
the playwright?

22:37.791 --> 22:40.402
-What? Who?
-Never mind.

22:40.446 --> 22:42.883
Anyway, once we're inside

22:42.926 --> 22:46.930
-the Easter Bunny's lair, we--
-Raid the fridge.

22:46.974 --> 22:50.891
Well, that's nothin'. I mean,
the-- yes, of course,
we'll raid the fridge

22:50.934 --> 22:55.330
but, but, but, but
that's not our primary goal.

22:55.374 --> 22:57.071
Lair is like that. [laughs]

22:57.114 --> 23:01.380
I bet you they got
two fridges, maybe three.

23:01.423 --> 23:03.425
I'll bet they do, Frizzlebat.

23:03.469 --> 23:05.601
I'll bet they do.

23:05.645 --> 23:08.735
Full of delish Easter treats.

23:08.778 --> 23:11.172
Yes. Easter treats.

23:11.215 --> 23:13.261
Okay. Well, le-- let's
stay on point.

23:13.304 --> 23:15.611
Follow me here. Once we're in,

23:15.655 --> 23:17.700
I will use the power

23:17.744 --> 23:20.529
of The Great Invisible
Easter Egg of Muffet Land

23:20.573 --> 23:23.967
to take over Benny's
Easter machine controls

23:24.011 --> 23:26.840
and turn that
whole blasted holiday

23:26.883 --> 23:30.365
upside down. [laughs]

23:30.409 --> 23:32.933
[chuckles]
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

23:32.976 --> 23:34.761
S-- So how are
you gonna do it, boss or

23:34.804 --> 23:37.546
how are you gonna
make Easter stink?

23:37.590 --> 23:39.635
I'm glad you asked, Frizzlebat

23:39.679 --> 23:43.422
because I think
my plan is so simple.

23:43.465 --> 23:46.468
It's, it's, it's genius.

23:46.512 --> 23:48.644
Tell me. Tell me. [laughs]

23:48.688 --> 23:50.690
Tell me. The suspense
is killing me.

23:50.733 --> 23:53.867
I'm going
to give out rotten eggs

23:53.910 --> 23:56.260
to every boy and girl

23:56.304 --> 23:58.872
across the land. [laughs]

23:58.915 --> 24:01.831
Eggs so foul and putrid

24:01.875 --> 24:04.486
that every child in the world

24:04.530 --> 24:07.924
will hate Easter
once and for all.

24:07.968 --> 24:11.275
Eeeeeeew.

24:11.319 --> 24:13.190
I wouldn't
wanna be in their shoes

24:13.234 --> 24:15.454
when they crack open
those things!

24:15.497 --> 24:16.803
[laughs]

24:17.891 --> 24:20.589
You're a genius, Bad Clyde.

24:20.633 --> 24:23.070
I know. That's why
you're the minion

24:23.113 --> 24:25.115
and I'm the boss, Frizzlebat.

24:25.159 --> 24:28.031
Hmm. Yeah but, uh,
I'm clever too

24:28.075 --> 24:29.816
aren't I, Bad Clyde? Huh?

24:29.859 --> 24:33.210
Sure, you are. I couldn't
do a thing as audacious

24:33.254 --> 24:35.648
as destroying Easter
without good help.

24:35.691 --> 24:40.000
But remember, heavy is the head
that wears the crown.

24:40.043 --> 24:42.306
Evil doings' a lot of work!

24:42.350 --> 24:46.528
And I have a pretty heavy head.
[laughs]

24:46.572 --> 24:48.791
No doubt, boss. [laughs]

24:48.835 --> 24:51.968
You're heavy all over. [laughs]

24:53.056 --> 24:55.842
Speaking of, how will we
get to the Easter lair?

24:55.885 --> 24:58.322
It's far and you're fat.

24:58.366 --> 24:59.715
What did you say?

24:59.759 --> 25:02.239
I said you're
pretty fit. [chuckles]

25:02.283 --> 25:05.286
Uh, but the lair is far away.
That's what I said.

25:05.329 --> 25:09.551
That's right.
I am fit, very fit,

25:09.595 --> 25:11.292
but we must make haste.

25:11.335 --> 25:13.773
We haven't got
much time before Easter.

25:13.816 --> 25:16.079
With the help of my magical egg

25:16.123 --> 25:18.038
we'll be there in no time.

25:18.081 --> 25:21.302
[music]

25:21.345 --> 25:24.610
If you would have told me
yesterday that
I wouldn't be relaxing

25:24.653 --> 25:26.612
with some
springtime eggnog right now

25:26.655 --> 25:29.005
but insist in trying
to rescue The Easter Bunny

25:29.049 --> 25:32.879
and Easter's very existence
from an evil spell,

25:32.922 --> 25:35.577
I'd have left you,
right out of the North Pole!

25:35.621 --> 25:40.234
The Great Invisible
Easter Egg of Muffet Land
is no laughing matter.

25:40.277 --> 25:43.150
Just when you thought
the Holiday world was safe.

25:43.193 --> 25:45.935
I see that now,
the foolishness of my ways.

25:45.979 --> 25:49.852
Gargaff, think.
Use your reindeer brain.

25:49.896 --> 25:54.030
There must be something we can
do to save Benny and Henrietta.

25:54.074 --> 25:56.685
Thinking is not my forte, Santa.

25:56.729 --> 25:58.469
I do best when I sip eggnog.

25:58.513 --> 26:01.864
I need you
on your A-game, Gargaff.

26:01.908 --> 26:04.301
Drop the eggnog-talk and think.

26:04.345 --> 26:07.087
Hm-mm. I might
know someone who can help.

26:07.130 --> 26:10.960
Really? Tell me,
my trusty reindeer. Who?

26:11.004 --> 26:13.746
A few years ago,
before I came to the North Pole

26:13.789 --> 26:16.139
I made some runs
for The Great Sage.

26:16.183 --> 26:18.968
If anyone can break
the egg spell, it's him.

26:19.012 --> 26:21.841
The Great Sage.

26:21.884 --> 26:24.974
You think he'd
be interested in helping us?

26:25.018 --> 26:28.630
Why wouldn't he be?
He's a great and powerful sage.

26:28.674 --> 26:31.851
That he is, but, uh, ho-ho,

26:31.894 --> 26:35.245
he's also ornery
and short-tempered.

26:35.289 --> 26:39.510
What else we got, Santa? We must
try ornery or short tempered.

26:39.554 --> 26:41.861
We need help
and we need it stat.

26:41.904 --> 26:46.648
The Great Sage it is then.
Let's go. Ho-ho-ho.

26:47.649 --> 26:49.695
[music]

26:52.698 --> 26:54.264
Let's make haste, Henrietta.

26:54.308 --> 26:55.962
We must make it
to The Great King

26:56.005 --> 26:59.966
before Bad Clyde
ruins Easter forever.

27:00.009 --> 27:03.099
Should we bring The Mushroom
King some gifts of tidings?

27:03.143 --> 27:04.318
What do you suggest?

27:04.361 --> 27:05.754
I could lay an egg.

27:05.798 --> 27:08.191
He hates birds, remember?

27:08.235 --> 27:11.717
An egg is just
a bird in an oval box.

27:11.760 --> 27:17.548
Yeah, you're right.
Maybe some butter or something.

27:17.592 --> 27:20.290
[music]

27:22.641 --> 27:26.819
Hold on, helium heads.
Just where do you two think
you're going?

27:26.862 --> 27:29.386
We are looking
for The Great King.

27:29.430 --> 27:31.345
Can you tell us
where to find him?

27:31.388 --> 27:35.349
They're looking for The Great
King and they need our help.

27:35.392 --> 27:37.612
[speaks to his alter ego]
-Isn't that special?
-Sure is.

27:37.656 --> 27:39.266
How much you got, Bunny?

27:39.309 --> 27:43.705
Excuse me? Uh, oh, uh,
we don't have any money.

27:43.749 --> 27:46.403
You hear that?
They don't have no money.

27:46.447 --> 27:49.842
Uff, you two are in
for a long hard road ahead.

27:49.885 --> 27:51.713
Ha, I guess you haven't heard.

27:51.757 --> 27:55.021
This is our land
and you must pay the toll.

27:55.064 --> 27:57.240
Yeah. The hen will do.

27:57.284 --> 27:59.199
In return, we'll tell you

27:59.242 --> 28:02.550
exactly where to find
The Great King, more or less.

28:02.593 --> 28:06.336
What are we going to do, Benny?
We're penniless

28:06.380 --> 28:09.862
and I sure don't wanna
stay behind in The Land
of Holiday Misfits.

28:09.905 --> 28:11.515
Let me handle this.

28:11.559 --> 28:14.736
Handle it quickly, Benny
or I might be tempted.

28:14.780 --> 28:18.174
Dear, dear fellas,
we appreciate the barter idea

28:18.218 --> 28:22.135
but I have
a third option to propose.

28:22.178 --> 28:26.487
You're in no position
to make demands, rabbit,
but I'll humor you.

28:26.530 --> 28:32.841
-What do you propose?
-I propose you help two lost
travelers on their journey home

28:32.885 --> 28:35.583
by telling us where we
can find The Great King,

28:35.626 --> 28:40.370
out of the kindness
of your own hearts.

28:40.414 --> 28:44.984
-Doesn't he know
that our hearts are black as--
-But sweetness,

28:45.027 --> 28:47.421
I said we should
spread some sweet kindness

28:47.464 --> 28:50.380
and help those lost
travelers find The Great King

28:50.424 --> 28:52.208
so that they can get home safe.

28:52.252 --> 28:53.949
What's happening?

28:53.993 --> 28:56.778
Shh! You don't get
to be The Easter Bunny

28:56.822 --> 28:59.085
without learning some
neat tricks. Watch this.

28:59.128 --> 29:03.742
[chuckles] Barry,
which direction will
take us to the King?

29:03.785 --> 29:07.354
Look for narrow pathway
along the tall oak trees.

29:07.397 --> 29:10.183
-And then?
-Follow the narrow pathway

29:10.226 --> 29:14.143
until you find yourself
in the Magic Valley. [laughs]

29:14.187 --> 29:18.017
There is where
The Great King dwells.

29:18.060 --> 29:20.976
Thanks, guys.
You've been a great help.

29:21.020 --> 29:24.763
Oooh, goody, uh.
Nice to meet you both.

29:24.806 --> 29:26.155
Be safe out there.

29:26.199 --> 29:28.331
[music]

29:28.375 --> 29:30.333
[wind howling]

29:30.377 --> 29:33.336
On our way, we go
to meet The Great King.

29:33.380 --> 29:36.557
Um, what in the world

29:36.600 --> 29:40.387
-just happened back there?
-The oldest trick in the book.

29:40.430 --> 29:47.046
Uh, I simply showed
those two that sweetness trumps
bitterness every time.

29:47.089 --> 29:49.875
You know, after all this time

29:49.918 --> 29:52.616
you never fail
to surprise me, Benny.

29:52.660 --> 29:56.751
Back at you, Hen.
Now, keep your eyes peeled
for the Magic Valley.

29:56.795 --> 29:59.145
We have a king to catch.

29:59.188 --> 30:01.887
[music]

30:01.930 --> 30:06.935
Hm, I could eat a horse,
figuratively speaking I mean.

30:06.979 --> 30:08.981
Santa, what do you
say we take a break

30:09.024 --> 30:11.287
and order up
some pre-Easter brunch?

30:11.331 --> 30:13.333
[laughs] I'm famished.

30:13.376 --> 30:16.379
That sounds delightful, Gargaff.

30:16.423 --> 30:21.080
[chuckles] My belly could use
a little filling as well

30:21.123 --> 30:22.995
but first things first.

30:23.038 --> 30:27.477
We must handle our business
and find The Great Sage.

30:27.521 --> 30:30.306
[music]

30:35.616 --> 30:37.313
Excuse me, good sir,

30:37.357 --> 30:40.664
you look like
you know your way around here.

30:40.708 --> 30:43.842
I'm looking for The Great Sage.

30:43.885 --> 30:48.977
[snorts] My name is Marley Quinn

30:49.021 --> 30:54.026
and does it say
tour guide on my forehead?

30:54.069 --> 30:57.333
Mm. No, it doesn't.

30:57.377 --> 30:58.726
It most certainly doesn't.

30:58.769 --> 31:01.424
Then why are you asking me

31:01.468 --> 31:04.036
gramps and goofy mule?

31:04.079 --> 31:08.344
Goofy Mule? How dare you!
I'm a Christmas reindeer.

31:08.388 --> 31:11.260
Whatever, you two look

31:11.304 --> 31:13.306
goofy to me.

31:13.349 --> 31:14.698
[chuckles]

31:14.742 --> 31:18.485
Hey, eyes don't lie.

31:18.528 --> 31:21.836
Fine. I can't fault your eyes
for seeing what's not there.

31:22.793 --> 31:24.360
Regardless, I must ask you

31:24.404 --> 31:25.927
do-- do you know
where we can order

31:25.971 --> 31:27.798
some good bangers and mash
around here?

31:27.842 --> 31:31.541
Here we go again with
the tour guide questions.

31:31.585 --> 31:34.936
Okay, comedians, tell you what,

31:34.980 --> 31:37.069
I know the answers

31:37.112 --> 31:39.723
to both your questions

31:39.767 --> 31:41.421
and I'll tell you

31:41.464 --> 31:45.729
on one condition.

31:45.773 --> 31:48.080
Sure. What is it?

31:48.123 --> 31:49.908
You must answer

31:49.951 --> 31:55.130
my unsolvable riddle first.

31:55.174 --> 31:59.787
Oh no, a riddle? I'm terrible
at brain crunches
on an empty stomach.

31:59.830 --> 32:04.444
Oh, have it your way.
Good luck, rubes.

32:04.487 --> 32:05.793
[laughs]

32:05.836 --> 32:09.144
Let me know how life goes.

32:09.188 --> 32:12.539
We can always try.
What's the harm in that?

32:12.582 --> 32:16.978
Well, the harm is
that if you fail

32:17.022 --> 32:19.502
I will turn you

32:19.546 --> 32:22.941
into bog frogs.

32:22.984 --> 32:27.597
And I tell you
life as a bog frog is [laughs]

32:27.641 --> 32:30.339
muddy, stinky,

32:30.383 --> 32:34.387
and downright unpleasant.

32:34.430 --> 32:37.259
Ho-ho-ho-no!

32:37.303 --> 32:40.088
For all the snowflakes
in the universe

32:40.132 --> 32:42.612
that doesn't
sound like a good deal.

32:42.656 --> 32:44.571
I say we go back
to the North Pole, Santa

32:44.614 --> 32:47.748
and get that massage and mud
mask we've been talking about.

32:47.791 --> 32:50.316
Just chill out until
Christmas comes rolling around.

32:50.359 --> 32:53.232
No way, no how!

32:53.275 --> 32:56.757
We must find The Great Sage
no matter the risk.

32:56.800 --> 32:59.455
Go ahead, good fella, ask away.

32:59.499 --> 33:03.068
Oh, boy,
I better practice my croak.

33:03.111 --> 33:05.635
[laughs]

33:05.679 --> 33:08.769
Here it goes.

33:08.812 --> 33:12.903
What has a mouth
but cannot talk?

33:12.947 --> 33:14.688
What can run

33:14.731 --> 33:17.908
but never walks?

33:17.952 --> 33:22.435
What has a head,
but cannot weep?

33:22.478 --> 33:26.221
What has a bed,
but cannot sleep?

33:26.265 --> 33:28.876
Answer me that and I'll tell you

33:28.919 --> 33:32.401
all you want to know.

33:32.445 --> 33:34.838
You had to ask
didn't you, Santa?

33:34.882 --> 33:39.147
Come now, Gargaff. Life is full
of obstacles and opportunities.

33:39.191 --> 33:43.325
We never get anywhere if we
can't tell one from the other.

33:43.369 --> 33:45.936
This is an opportunity.

33:45.980 --> 33:47.982
Well, I have
a head that can weep,

33:48.026 --> 33:50.289
watch me cry a river

33:50.332 --> 33:53.118
as I get ready to be
turned into a bog frog.

33:53.161 --> 33:56.686
That's it, Gargaff,
you just solved the riddle.

33:56.730 --> 33:58.297
-I did?
-Yes.

33:58.340 --> 34:00.386
-What did I say?
-Think about it.

34:00.429 --> 34:04.520
You said you have
a head that can weep and what?

34:04.564 --> 34:06.609
Watch me cry a river if, if--

34:06.653 --> 34:11.092
Yes. What has a mouth,
but cannot talk?

34:11.136 --> 34:13.355
What can run, but never walks?

34:13.399 --> 34:16.184
What has a head,
but cannot weep?

34:16.228 --> 34:19.231
What has a bed,
but cannot sleep?

34:19.274 --> 34:23.235
A river!
Are we right, Marley Quinn?

34:23.278 --> 34:28.066
Oh yes, you are correct.

34:28.109 --> 34:31.678
It i-- it is a river.

34:31.721 --> 34:35.247
You two
are smarter than you look.

34:35.290 --> 34:39.686
Ho-ho-ho. One for the good guys.

34:39.729 --> 34:42.297
Woot-woot. Uh-huh. Woot-woot.

34:42.341 --> 34:46.475
Oh, stop your hullabaloo,
you annoying creatures.

34:46.519 --> 34:49.957
We won't stop until you tell
us where to find The Great Sage.

34:50.000 --> 34:54.004
In that case,
follow the great path

34:54.048 --> 34:59.184
to the un-chanted woods
of Gwen Hail Falls.

34:59.227 --> 35:02.143
There you will find

35:02.187 --> 35:05.799
The Great Sage.

35:06.669 --> 35:08.889
Hens in the coop

35:08.932 --> 35:12.153
makes the best hangers and mash.

35:12.197 --> 35:13.807
[laughs] Tell her

35:13.850 --> 35:17.202
Marley Quinn sent you.

35:18.725 --> 35:21.467
I still can't believe
we did it. [chuckling]

35:21.510 --> 35:25.340
We're going to
destroy Easter forever.

35:25.384 --> 35:29.170
Not so fast, Frizzlebat.
It's true, we're almost there.

35:29.214 --> 35:31.172
But our mission
won't be complete

35:31.216 --> 35:34.393
until the children
awake Easter morning

35:34.436 --> 35:37.483
in their stench-filled homes
to find nothing

35:37.526 --> 35:41.617
but fitted baskets
of rotten eggs. [laughs]

35:45.230 --> 35:48.276
Yeah, but with Benny
The Easter Bunny out of the way

35:48.320 --> 35:50.713
nothing can stop us now.
[chuckles]

35:50.757 --> 35:55.414
It's gonna be
glorious and stinky.

35:55.457 --> 35:59.635
There is one small problem
that could give us trouble

35:59.679 --> 36:02.029
if we don't eliminate it now.

36:02.072 --> 36:05.598
Benny's helper, Cosmo,
is still around.

36:05.641 --> 36:09.210
He's not The Easter Bunny,
but he is dedicated

36:09.254 --> 36:13.301
and will do anything
to save this lousy Holiday.

36:13.345 --> 36:15.434
[Frizzlebat sighs]

36:15.477 --> 36:18.045
You're thinking
what I'm thinking, boss?

36:18.088 --> 36:20.874
I am, Frizzlebat.
It's time to get rid

36:20.917 --> 36:23.224
of the last snag in our plan.

36:23.268 --> 36:26.053
Cosmo, watch out! [laughs]

36:26.096 --> 36:27.837
Here we come.

36:29.187 --> 36:30.884
[music]

36:36.455 --> 36:38.326
O Great Sage.

36:38.370 --> 36:41.982
We come from far
and wide to see you.

36:42.025 --> 36:47.248
I see. Who are you
and what do you seek?

36:47.292 --> 36:49.337
Ho-ho, I am Santa,

36:49.381 --> 36:52.819
and this is my Christmas
reindeer, Gargaff.

36:52.862 --> 36:54.429
We come to seek help.

36:54.473 --> 36:58.172
A wicked creature has
gotten his evil hands on

36:58.216 --> 37:01.828
The Great Invisible
Easter Egg of Muffet land.

37:01.871 --> 37:05.135
And used it
to cast a banishment spell

37:05.179 --> 37:06.963
on The Easter Bunny.

37:07.007 --> 37:09.270
Great Scott, the egg is capable

37:09.314 --> 37:11.925
of great good and great harm.

37:11.968 --> 37:16.756
Where has the Easter Bunny
been banished to?

37:16.799 --> 37:18.888
The Land of the Holiday Misfits.

37:18.932 --> 37:22.327
Oh boy!
He-- he-- he's in trouble.

37:22.370 --> 37:26.287
I am afraid so,
O Great Sage of sages.

37:26.331 --> 37:29.812
This is why we've come.
We seek your help.

37:29.856 --> 37:32.989
If the Bunny has
already crossed over,

37:33.033 --> 37:35.731
there's not much we can
do to bring him back.

37:35.775 --> 37:39.387
Huh-huh, it's entirely
up to him to escape.

37:39.431 --> 37:42.172
I was afraid of that.

37:42.216 --> 37:43.522
Bummer of bummers.

37:43.565 --> 37:46.438
-However...
-however?

37:46.481 --> 37:51.051
There is one surefire way
to defeat an invisible egg

37:51.094 --> 37:53.314
-evil doers.
-There is?

37:53.358 --> 37:58.188
Yes, and if you defeat him
you can still save Easter.

37:58.232 --> 38:02.192
-But how?
-The power of
a Christmas reindeer

38:02.236 --> 38:07.328
can topple even the most
evil egg wielder, you see.

38:07.372 --> 38:10.505
[snorts]
Come on. Are you serious?

38:10.549 --> 38:14.553
I am indeed.
Whether you realize it or not

38:14.596 --> 38:17.164
you hold your own power

38:17.207 --> 38:20.689
and it can move mountains
if you let it, my friend.

38:20.733 --> 38:22.909
Oh get out, that can't be true.

38:22.952 --> 38:25.607
It is true.
Back in the olden days

38:25.651 --> 38:30.525
reindeers were capable of
reversing any and all spells.

38:30.569 --> 38:31.831
Have you forgotten?

38:31.874 --> 38:34.355
Mm. I guess I have.

38:34.399 --> 38:37.880
You must remember
your powers, reindeer.

38:37.924 --> 38:40.013
It's up to you
to use your powers

38:40.056 --> 38:42.972
to make wrong things
right again.

38:43.016 --> 38:45.235
Oh, boy. The pressure is on.

38:45.279 --> 38:46.846
Can you tell
I'm sweating, Santa?

38:54.636 --> 38:57.204
We have arrived!
We should find The Great King

38:57.247 --> 39:00.294
of The Land of Holiday Misfits
somewhere around here.

39:01.208 --> 39:03.906
[jolly music]

39:07.170 --> 39:10.435
Halt! Who goes there?

39:10.478 --> 39:14.264
[clears throat] Greetings,
O great and mighty King.

39:14.308 --> 39:17.485
Forgive our intrusion
but we seem to have become lost

39:17.529 --> 39:20.270
and would love
to find our way home.

39:20.314 --> 39:25.885
Home? What say you, strangers?
This is home.

39:25.928 --> 39:30.411
For you, King, but for us
home is back in Easterland.

39:30.455 --> 39:35.198
Easter? I haven't heard
that word in a dragon's age.

39:35.242 --> 39:37.505
Is it still celebrated?

39:37.549 --> 39:39.681
It's bigger
than ever, great King.

39:39.725 --> 39:43.859
In fact, meet Benny,
The Easter Bunny.

39:43.903 --> 39:46.253
He's the ambassador of Easter.

39:46.296 --> 39:48.124
You are the--

39:48.168 --> 39:51.519
In the flesh.
Pleasure to meet you, King.

39:51.563 --> 39:55.697
Ew, I hate bunnies!

39:55.741 --> 39:58.439
They hop all over
my vegetable garden.

39:58.483 --> 40:01.703
I don't hop in vegetable
gardens, O Great King.

40:01.747 --> 40:05.054
I'm too busy running
the Easter holidays.

40:05.098 --> 40:08.014
So what are you doing here?

40:08.057 --> 40:12.888
Uh, shouldn't you be preparing
eggs and, uh gifts, and whatnot?

40:13.889 --> 40:18.981
What time of year
is it over there?

40:19.025 --> 40:22.507
We keep time
differently here, you know.

40:22.550 --> 40:24.770
It's Easter eve
where we come from.

40:24.813 --> 40:28.121
Well, what in the world
are you doing here?

40:28.164 --> 40:30.471
Shouldn't you be working?

40:30.515 --> 40:33.561
That's what we're hoping
to talk to you about, King.

40:33.605 --> 40:37.086
You see, we-- we don't
want to miss Easter at all,

40:37.130 --> 40:39.828
but a real bad guy
cast a spell on us

40:39.872 --> 40:43.789
and banished us here
against our will.

40:43.832 --> 40:48.924
If I had one farthing
every time I heard that one, oh.

40:48.968 --> 40:52.362
We were told you could help us
get back home, O Great King.

40:52.406 --> 40:54.452
Is that so, uh, and then

40:54.495 --> 40:57.585
why exactly would I do that?

40:57.629 --> 41:00.109
Because you're
a kind and fair king

41:00.153 --> 41:03.069
who doesn't want
to see The Easter Bunny
trapped in your world

41:03.112 --> 41:07.247
while millions and millions
of children go without Easter.

41:07.290 --> 41:10.511
And who are you?

41:10.555 --> 41:13.558
Oh, this is my good friend
Henrietta the hen.

41:13.601 --> 41:15.647
She's a great Easter helper.

41:15.690 --> 41:19.912
[clucking]
Oh, Benny, you flatter me.

41:19.955 --> 41:23.698
A bird, urgh!

41:23.742 --> 41:27.180
I hate birds.
They poop everywhere.

41:27.223 --> 41:31.532
I don't poop everywhere.
I only poop where I should.

41:31.576 --> 41:36.102
Which is in the most
inappropriate places.

41:36.145 --> 41:39.279
-Not true.
-Ah, fine.

41:39.322 --> 41:43.805
While you two are busy not
hopping nor pooping [chuckles]

41:43.849 --> 41:46.634
I'll return to my kingly duties.

41:46.678 --> 41:48.897
I'm mu-- much too busy

41:48.941 --> 41:51.770
to waste my time with you two.

41:51.813 --> 41:55.861
Uh, King before you go,
do you think you could maybe

41:55.904 --> 41:58.428
uh, grant us
passage back to our world?

41:58.472 --> 42:01.780
No, is that
a simple enough answer?

42:01.823 --> 42:07.525
Scram or I know what I'll
be eating for dinner tonight,

42:07.568 --> 42:10.310
rabbit and hen stew.

42:10.353 --> 42:13.531
Say, Great King,
we heard your son

42:13.574 --> 42:17.970
the Prince has abandoned
his royal duties and run off
to The Land of Magic.

42:19.014 --> 42:23.279
If we were to,
say, return the Prince to you,

42:23.323 --> 42:26.195
do you think you could
repay us by sending us home?

42:26.239 --> 42:28.546
My son? Oh...

42:28.589 --> 42:32.114
Others have tried to convince
the Prince to return to me,

42:32.158 --> 42:35.901
but, uh, he's headstrong
and independent

42:35.944 --> 42:38.164
just like his old man.

42:38.207 --> 42:40.819
Sounds like
a chip off the old block.

42:40.862 --> 42:43.561
You got that right, eh. Alas!

42:43.604 --> 42:48.435
If you return the Prince to me,
I will grant your wish.

42:48.478 --> 42:50.045
We'll do our best, King, and,

42:50.089 --> 42:52.482
and thank you for
the opportunity to help.

42:52.526 --> 42:55.355
Good luck, Hopper and Pooper!
[laughs]

42:55.398 --> 42:57.749
I hope you succeed.

42:58.750 --> 43:02.580
There's the Easter lair, boss.
Dead ahead.

43:02.623 --> 43:05.278
Yes, we are right on course
Frizzlebat.

43:05.321 --> 43:08.760
When we get there, Cosmo
will come out to greet us.

43:08.803 --> 43:10.413
When he does

43:10.457 --> 43:14.592
we'll have the invisible egg
ready and zap!

43:14.635 --> 43:16.942
Zap! [laughs]

43:16.985 --> 43:19.858
And that goofy Cosmo
will join his friends

43:19.901 --> 43:23.513
in The Land of The Holiday
Misfits forever [laughs].

43:25.080 --> 43:28.910
And Easter will be ours.
[laughs]

43:32.435 --> 43:34.524
Pace yourself, Gargaff, remember

43:34.568 --> 43:37.963
the future of Easter
rides on your powers.

43:38.006 --> 43:41.096
Thanks, Santa,
[sarcastic laugh]
no pressure or anything.

43:41.140 --> 43:44.056
I have the utmost faith in you,
my friend.

43:44.099 --> 43:47.712
You've been a hero
to children across the globe,

43:47.755 --> 43:51.019
keeping us
on schedule every year.

43:51.063 --> 43:55.241
Now you'll be a hero
on Easter Sunday too.

43:55.284 --> 43:57.591
A two-holiday reindeer.

43:57.635 --> 44:01.987
You'll go down in history,
ho-ho-ho.

44:02.030 --> 44:04.511
Where have I heard that before?

44:04.554 --> 44:07.732
Ho-ho-ho. Onward, Gargaff

44:07.775 --> 44:10.386
we've an Easter to rescue.

44:10.430 --> 44:12.475
[music]

44:17.002 --> 44:18.568
I gotta hand it to you, Hen

44:18.612 --> 44:20.658
that was a gutsy play back there

44:20.701 --> 44:23.008
wagering our release
on the Prince's return.

44:23.051 --> 44:25.140
It was worth a try.

44:25.184 --> 44:27.882
Besides, I've seen
you work wonders, Benny.

44:27.926 --> 44:29.188
I think we can do it.

44:30.319 --> 44:32.234
Look, down there.

44:32.278 --> 44:35.498
[Henrietta] Is that Pippen
the Christmas Elf?

44:35.542 --> 44:39.633
Last I heard, he was
kicked out of the North Pole
for stealing presents

44:39.677 --> 44:41.330
and selling them on the side.

44:41.374 --> 44:43.637
It is. Should we talk to him?

44:43.681 --> 44:45.770
He, he's-- he's back boop crazy!

44:45.813 --> 44:48.642
Maybe he knows where
to find the Mushroom Prince.

44:48.686 --> 44:49.687
You're right.

44:50.862 --> 44:53.908
Hello again, Pippen,
it's been a while.

44:53.952 --> 44:57.912
Fancy meeting you here, Hoppy.
[laughs]

44:57.956 --> 45:01.611
Don't you have an Easter
to attend to?

45:01.655 --> 45:03.962
We're uh, we're working on that.

45:04.005 --> 45:08.401
Say you-- you don't happen to
know where we might find
the Prince, do you?

45:08.444 --> 45:12.579
I know everything
that goes on around here,

45:12.622 --> 45:14.233
cottontail.

45:14.276 --> 45:16.583
You ought to know that by now

45:16.626 --> 45:20.021
nothing escapes my eye.

45:20.065 --> 45:24.722
Great! You could tell us where
we can find the Prince
of the Land of Misfits.

45:24.765 --> 45:27.289
Sure, I could, but--

45:27.333 --> 45:30.989
But what kind of fun
would that be for me?

45:31.032 --> 45:33.774
[laughs] No, I-- I think

45:33.818 --> 45:36.559
you gotta answer
a question for Pippen

45:36.603 --> 45:38.692
before Pippen will

45:38.736 --> 45:42.087
answer a question for you.

45:42.130 --> 45:44.480
Okay, uh, what's your question?

45:44.524 --> 45:47.135
Riddle me this, Lucky Foot

45:47.179 --> 45:50.182
um, I'm as light as a feather

45:50.225 --> 45:52.837
yet the strongest man

45:52.880 --> 45:57.580
can't hold me
for more than five minutes.

45:57.624 --> 46:00.758
What am I?

46:00.801 --> 46:03.891
-Uh, I'm stumped.
-We can do this, Benny.

46:03.935 --> 46:08.026
It's a trick question.
It's got to be simple, right?

46:08.069 --> 46:12.813
Probably ridiculously simple,
but we-- we're running
out of time fast.

46:12.857 --> 46:18.340
Let's think, let's think.
I'm as light as a feather
yet the strongest man

46:18.384 --> 46:23.911
can't hold me
for more than five minutes, hmm.

46:23.955 --> 46:26.958
I'm not holding my breath we can
solve this one, Henrietta.

46:27.001 --> 46:30.918
Wait, that's it.
You solved it, Benny.

46:30.962 --> 46:36.010
I'm as light as a feather,
yet the strongest man can't hold
me for more than five minutes.

46:36.054 --> 46:39.535
I'm breath, right?

46:39.579 --> 46:43.452
Ah, you two are no fun.
Yeah, that's right.

46:43.496 --> 46:46.934
The Great Prince is hiding
from his father that way

46:46.978 --> 46:49.632
in the Valley of No.

46:49.676 --> 46:52.810
-You can't miss him.
-Thank you, Pippen.

46:52.853 --> 46:55.638
Yeah, yeah,
give Santa my regards.

46:57.466 --> 47:00.252
[Clyde laughs]
Back off, foolish creatures.

47:00.295 --> 47:04.256
Easter's ours now,
and so is this place.

47:04.299 --> 47:06.606
He-he yeah, airhead. [laughs]

47:06.649 --> 47:08.869
Kiss your Holiday goodbye.

47:08.913 --> 47:12.133
Bad Clyde's
gonna run the show now.

47:12.177 --> 47:16.181
What?
Where's Bunny and Henrietta?
What have you done with them?

47:16.224 --> 47:20.011
Nothing we aren't going to do
to you too, poultry creature.

47:20.054 --> 47:26.495
Yeah. Prepare to join your
buddies in The Land of
the Holiday Misfits.

47:26.539 --> 47:29.934
The Land of the Holiday Misfits?
But tomorrow is Easter.

47:29.977 --> 47:32.327
We don't have time
for this foolishness.

47:32.371 --> 47:34.852
Correction. [laughs]

47:34.895 --> 47:38.290
Tomorrow was Easter. [laughs]

47:40.335 --> 47:44.600
Now, it will be a day
of darkness, misery,

47:44.644 --> 47:48.169
and rotten eggs. [laughs]

47:49.040 --> 47:53.174
That's right. And after kids
all over the world

47:53.218 --> 47:56.569
find their basket full
of rotten eggs in the morning

47:56.612 --> 48:00.747
it will be known as
the worst day in history.

48:00.790 --> 48:03.097
You can't do this. I forbid you.

48:03.141 --> 48:06.405
You can forbid us
all you want, you bore.

48:06.448 --> 48:08.363
It won't do you any good.

48:08.407 --> 48:12.585
Prepare to meet your fluffy
friends in the great beyond.

48:12.628 --> 48:13.978
[wind howling]

48:14.021 --> 48:16.806
Hello there,
are you the great Prince

48:16.850 --> 48:19.070
of The Land
of the Holiday Misfits?

48:19.113 --> 48:22.725
That's me,
and who are you two bros?

48:22.769 --> 48:24.510
I'm Benny, The Easter Bunny

48:24.553 --> 48:28.340
and this here's Henrietta,
the Easter Hen.

48:28.383 --> 48:31.256
Sweet!
Hey-- hey, you wanna hang out?

48:31.299 --> 48:34.346
It's just me here so,
you got plenty of room.

48:34.389 --> 48:37.218
Where did you guys
come from anyway?

48:37.262 --> 48:39.177
Funny you asked, Prince.

48:39.220 --> 48:42.571
We indeed have quite a story.

48:42.615 --> 48:45.661
We were banished here
by an evil spell

48:45.705 --> 48:48.664
and we're-- we're trying to get
back home in time to deliver

48:48.708 --> 48:51.102
Easter gifts to all the kids.

48:51.145 --> 48:56.672
No way. Hey, are you the--

48:56.716 --> 49:01.068
Great Prince,
meet Benny The Easter Bunny.

49:01.112 --> 49:05.551
Sweet. I thought
you looked familiar, dude.

49:05.594 --> 49:07.727
I'm a big fan of yours.

49:07.770 --> 49:11.165
Really? Well, uh, I'm honored.

49:11.209 --> 49:13.385
The honor is all mine, bro

49:13.428 --> 49:16.431
but uh, you guys
gotta get out of here.

49:16.475 --> 49:19.086
It's gonna be
Easter this year, right?

49:19.130 --> 49:22.394
It is,
but-- but we have one problem.

49:22.437 --> 49:24.700
This spell's holding us trapped,

49:24.744 --> 49:27.877
and only your father,
The Great King
can reverse it.

49:27.921 --> 49:30.010
We need him to grant us release

49:30.054 --> 49:33.187
or we're stuck here forever.

49:33.231 --> 49:37.061
Bummer,
my old man's a real hard case.

49:37.104 --> 49:42.501
I'm sure he can be, but he was
actually kind enough
to agree to let us go.

49:42.544 --> 49:45.460
He was? Whoa, he never just,

49:45.504 --> 49:47.680
you know, helps people.

49:47.723 --> 49:49.464
We negotiated with him.

49:49.508 --> 49:51.814
Must have been
a tough negotiation.

49:51.858 --> 49:55.470
Well, that depends on you.

49:55.514 --> 49:58.430
Me? Whoa!

49:58.473 --> 50:00.998
We promised to return his son,

50:01.041 --> 50:04.827
The Great Prince back to him
in exchange for our release.

50:04.871 --> 50:09.528
Oh, wow! [chuckles]
So, Easter's in my hands?

50:09.571 --> 50:11.182
It looks that way, Prince.

50:11.225 --> 50:12.748
And if you don't get home

50:12.792 --> 50:15.055
kids won't get anything
in their baskets?

50:15.099 --> 50:17.579
Actually,
we don't know what'll happen.

50:17.623 --> 50:20.365
Bad Clyde is in control and no,

50:20.408 --> 50:23.107
no telling
what he might do to our Holiday.

50:23.150 --> 50:25.457
Drag, man. [chuckles]

50:25.500 --> 50:29.809
Sounds like my old man.
Never lets me have any fun.

50:29.852 --> 50:34.944
He's all about obligation
and duty, and tradition.

50:34.988 --> 50:37.382
Huh, I just wanna chill, dudes.

50:37.425 --> 50:40.602
Maybe you guys can talk it out
and find a middle ground.

50:40.646 --> 50:43.910
Uh, the King may not be
the easiest guy to live with

50:43.953 --> 50:46.739
but we can tell he loves you

50:46.782 --> 50:49.046
and he wants the best for you.

50:49.089 --> 50:52.223
I love my pop too.
It's, It's not that
I don't support him

50:52.266 --> 50:55.487
it's just that I want to
do my own thing, you know

50:55.530 --> 50:57.228
and follow my own dreams.

50:57.271 --> 51:00.883
I wanna be a famous trombone
player, yeah. [chuckles]

51:00.927 --> 51:02.972
If you explain that to him

51:03.016 --> 51:05.018
maybe you'll come
to a new understanding

51:05.062 --> 51:07.499
and it'll be easier
to live with each other.

51:07.542 --> 51:09.544
Yeah, you're growing up

51:09.588 --> 51:13.026
but to your dad,
you're still his little Prince.

51:13.070 --> 51:15.985
I'm sure if you tell him
your dreams, he'll understand.

51:16.029 --> 51:17.074
You sure?

51:17.117 --> 51:18.945
Sure, we're sure.

51:18.988 --> 51:20.686
Sure, we're sure.

51:20.729 --> 51:23.428
You two are pretty level-headed.
[chuckles]

51:23.471 --> 51:25.082
Now let's go save Easter.

51:27.040 --> 51:30.130
And you'll
never be able to return.

51:30.174 --> 51:33.090
[laughs]
This is the end for you,

51:33.133 --> 51:36.571
your friends
and your irksome holiday.

51:36.615 --> 51:38.747
Give him my regards
when you see him

51:38.791 --> 51:41.315
and tell him Bad Clyde
sent all the kids

51:41.359 --> 51:44.188
rotten eggs. [laughs]

51:45.972 --> 51:49.845
Yeah, [chuckles]
and they cried and cried

51:49.889 --> 51:54.720
and couldn't believe the
Easter Bunny turned on them
like that. [chuckles]

51:54.763 --> 51:56.417
You'll never get away with this.

51:56.461 --> 51:58.071
I already have.

51:58.115 --> 52:00.987
Now say goodbye
to this world forever

52:01.030 --> 52:04.164
and hello to
The Land of Holiday Misfits.

52:04.208 --> 52:08.168
O Forces of darkness
opposed to the light.

52:08.212 --> 52:11.998
O Powers of pain,
O Bearers of fright.

52:12.041 --> 52:15.349
Deliver this subject
by day or by night.

52:15.393 --> 52:19.484
The foolish creature named Cosmo
who gives me the fits.

52:19.527 --> 52:22.182
Banish him to
The Land of the Holiday Mis--

52:22.226 --> 52:23.140
Stop!

52:25.577 --> 52:28.536
Release that bird
at once, Bad Clyde.

52:28.580 --> 52:31.583
Stick a stocking
in your pie-hole, fat man.

52:31.626 --> 52:33.715
I run this place now.

52:33.759 --> 52:37.328
Yeah, you ain't invited
down this chimney. [chuckles]

52:37.371 --> 52:40.200
[victorious music]

52:40.244 --> 52:42.811
Ah, you have returned.

52:42.855 --> 52:44.552
[chuckles] Well, let me guess

52:44.596 --> 52:47.773
The Great Prince
refused to come home.

52:47.816 --> 52:49.253
Wrong!

52:49.296 --> 52:53.039
Say hello to The Great Prince.

52:53.909 --> 52:55.346
Uh, the-- Son?

52:55.389 --> 52:57.957
Hey, yo-- yo, Dad.

52:58.000 --> 53:00.960
I, I'm sorry I ran away
in such a huff.

53:01.003 --> 53:03.658
Oh, oh, oh, my boy!

53:03.702 --> 53:05.704
I'm so glad you're back.

53:05.747 --> 53:09.664
So glad in fact, I will never
put down your dreams.

53:09.708 --> 53:13.625
You shall become a--
a great trombone player

53:13.668 --> 53:15.627
if that is what you want.

53:15.670 --> 53:18.543
I can? Really? Truly?

53:18.586 --> 53:20.327
You pinky swear?

53:20.371 --> 53:24.331
Yes, you can become
a trombone player

53:24.375 --> 53:26.725
if-- if that is
what makes you happy.

53:26.768 --> 53:30.381
Whoa, bro,
that's rave. [chuckles]

53:30.424 --> 53:34.820
Although, uh, I--
I decided I wanna be
a Pan-flute player instead.

53:34.863 --> 53:38.258
A trombone or
a Pan-flute, whatever.

53:38.302 --> 53:41.522
Uh, thanks, Dad.
Then I promise you I will attend

53:41.566 --> 53:44.612
to my royal duties
without complaining.

53:44.656 --> 53:49.443
You will be the great son
I have always longed for.

53:49.487 --> 53:50.792
I will!

53:50.836 --> 53:54.274
Aw, I'm clucking up, Benny.

53:54.318 --> 53:58.626
You did it,
you two returned my boy to me.

53:58.670 --> 54:01.368
How can I ever repay you?

54:01.412 --> 54:04.545
Send us back home
so we may save Easter.

54:04.589 --> 54:08.375
Uh, yes, I remember.
Well. [chuckles]

54:08.419 --> 54:10.421
It looks as though it's hello,

54:10.464 --> 54:12.858
goodbye Easter Bunny, but uh,

54:12.901 --> 54:16.775
but first, a going away party
for new friends.

54:16.818 --> 54:20.735
Oh, Great King, we--
we don't have much time!

54:20.779 --> 54:27.089
Nonsense.
We have all the time in the
world, uh, your world that is.

54:27.133 --> 54:30.963
We're not bound by
your minutes and hours here

54:31.006 --> 54:33.270
in The Land of Holiday Misfits,

54:33.313 --> 54:36.055
uh, time stands still.

54:36.098 --> 54:39.101
Well, in that case.

54:39.145 --> 54:42.322
It's party time.

54:42.366 --> 54:46.283
Yeah, bros. [chuckles]
Get the eggnog flowing, man.

54:46.326 --> 54:47.371
[chuckles]

54:47.414 --> 54:49.286
I want to thank you again,

54:49.329 --> 54:50.852
Benny and Henrietta

54:50.896 --> 54:54.552
for reuniting me with my boy.

54:54.595 --> 54:58.077
Don't mention it,
and he's all grown up

54:58.120 --> 55:00.384
in case you haven't noticed,
O Great King.

55:00.427 --> 55:02.560
What a fine fellow he is.

55:02.603 --> 55:04.692
I'm very lucky.

55:05.606 --> 55:09.349
You sure are. A-- and
despite all that we've heard

55:09.393 --> 55:13.875
The Land of the Holiday Misfits
can be a pretty cool place.

55:13.919 --> 55:17.879
Benny The Easter Bunny
and lovely Henrietta,

55:17.923 --> 55:21.796
you'll always be
welcomed in our land.

55:21.840 --> 55:23.668
Thank you, Great King.

55:23.711 --> 55:26.366
Maybe we'll visit
on vacation next winter.

55:26.410 --> 55:28.847
You guys have a deal.

55:28.890 --> 55:31.676
Henrietta, let's go home.

55:31.719 --> 55:34.635
Are you ready
for your journey back?

55:34.679 --> 55:36.463
Ready as we'll ever be.

55:36.507 --> 55:40.815
Friends, they come
and friends they go.

55:40.859 --> 55:44.341
Stay safe and warm
on your way home.

55:46.560 --> 55:48.649
[Bad Clyde] After we
take care of Cosmo here

55:48.693 --> 55:51.435
you two pesky
creatures are next.

55:51.478 --> 55:55.613
Then Christmas will
be mine too. [laughs]

55:58.398 --> 55:59.791
Back off, Bad Clyde!

55:59.834 --> 56:02.750
Or you'll do what, donkey face?

56:02.794 --> 56:05.492
Or I'll do something
I'd-- I'd might regret.

56:05.536 --> 56:09.366
Ooh, I'm real scared.

56:09.409 --> 56:10.976
Why don't you go back
to the kitchen

56:11.019 --> 56:13.500
and bake some cookies
for your fatty buddy?

56:13.544 --> 56:16.634
I actually lost ten pounds
on an all vegan diet.

56:16.677 --> 56:19.288
You did? You have
to give me some recipes.

56:19.332 --> 56:22.117
I can stand losing
a couple of pounds too.

56:22.161 --> 56:24.206
Oh, shut up, you two!

56:24.250 --> 56:27.514
Clyde, if you don't
let go of Cosmo right now

56:27.558 --> 56:29.734
w-- we're gonna
have a serious problem.

56:29.777 --> 56:32.693
He already told you once,
fancy feet.

56:32.737 --> 56:35.696
It sounds like you
prefer a clobbering!

56:35.740 --> 56:38.699
Uh-huh, that's enough, you guys.

56:38.743 --> 56:40.005
What the--

56:40.048 --> 56:42.268
Hey, what are they doing here?

56:42.311 --> 56:44.836
I thought we'd
banished them forever.

56:44.879 --> 56:49.014
Benny, Henrietta, you're back!

56:49.057 --> 56:50.885
-[Gargaff] But how?
-Miss me?

56:50.929 --> 56:52.365
No!

56:52.409 --> 56:54.367
Nice try, you losers

56:54.411 --> 56:56.804
but it's gonna take more
than an invisible toy

56:56.848 --> 57:00.025
and a bad attitude to
get rid of The Easter Bunny.

57:00.068 --> 57:03.202
Oh, yeah? Well then,
let's try again.

57:03.245 --> 57:06.466
Only this time
we'll send you all the way

57:06.510 --> 57:09.208
to The Land of Dust and Bones.

57:09.251 --> 57:12.472
Huh, let's see you try
to get back from there

57:12.516 --> 57:14.605
while you're still young.

57:14.648 --> 57:16.215
Where is that exactly?

57:16.258 --> 57:19.000
Benny, how did you two get here?

57:19.044 --> 57:21.742
We heard there was no way back

57:21.786 --> 57:24.223
from The Land
of the Holiday Misfits.

57:24.266 --> 57:27.748
It's a long story, Santa,
but i-- in short

57:27.792 --> 57:30.316
we met some pretty
rad dudes out there

57:30.359 --> 57:32.144
who helped us get home safe.

57:32.187 --> 57:34.712
And some nasty ones too.

57:34.755 --> 57:38.890
How about we tell you
all about it over Easter dinner?

57:38.933 --> 57:42.067
That sounds delightful,
ho-ho-ho.

57:42.110 --> 57:45.287
What are we, chopped ham?
We're still right here with

57:45.331 --> 57:48.508
The Great Invisible Easter Egg
of Muffet Land, mind you.

57:48.552 --> 57:53.818
And you're all about
to beat it to The Land
of Dust and Bones, forever!

57:53.861 --> 57:57.256
Then all
the holidays will be ours.

57:57.299 --> 57:58.475
[chuckles]

57:58.518 --> 58:00.346
Well, just the major ones.

58:00.389 --> 58:02.740
Oh, yeah,
I mean the ones that matter.

58:02.783 --> 58:04.132
Right! The big ones.

58:04.176 --> 58:06.613
Thanksgiving's pretty big too.

58:06.657 --> 58:10.487
Yeah, but it's like
it doesn't have a mascot.

58:10.530 --> 58:11.966
Turkeys.

58:12.010 --> 58:14.447
I know turkeys,
but they're not like

58:14.491 --> 58:18.103
The Thanksgiving Turkey,
like The Easter Bunny.

58:18.146 --> 58:20.671
-Right, right.
-Okay, here we go.

58:20.714 --> 58:23.717
O Forces of darkness,
opposed to the light.

58:23.761 --> 58:27.068
O Powers of pain,
O Bearers of fright.

58:27.112 --> 58:29.593
Oh, enough of this!
I'll take it from here.

58:29.636 --> 58:32.726
Reverse this dark spell,
cast straight from the pit.

58:32.770 --> 58:36.295
And banish these villains to
The Land of the Holiday Misfits.

58:36.338 --> 58:39.037
[music]

58:39.080 --> 58:41.996
[screams]

58:51.136 --> 58:55.096
Well, well, well. [chuckles]

58:55.140 --> 58:57.185
Look who showed up late
to the party.

58:57.229 --> 58:59.448
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

58:59.492 --> 59:02.408
Oh no,
I don't old pal. [chuckles]

59:02.451 --> 59:05.454
Welcome to the wonderful
Land of the Holiday Misfits.

59:05.498 --> 59:07.195
I think you'll enjoy it.

59:07.239 --> 59:10.068
Frizzlebuns, buddy,
thank goodness you're okay.

59:10.111 --> 59:12.244
I was worried sick about you.

59:12.287 --> 59:14.855
Mm-hmm, I'll bet you were.

59:14.899 --> 59:18.555
I was. I hardly slept at all.
[chuckles]

59:18.598 --> 59:22.036
I couldn't eat,
I was distraught.

59:22.080 --> 59:23.603
And I'll bet you didn't go along

59:23.647 --> 59:25.953
with a single thing
this guy said, did you?

59:25.997 --> 59:30.479
Bad Clyde?
Pft, no, of course not.

59:30.523 --> 59:34.309
After what he did to you?
Mm... monster.

59:34.353 --> 59:38.487
I can't possibly spend eternity
trapped with you two morons.

59:38.531 --> 59:41.229
Frizzlebuns, tell me
how to get out of here.

59:41.273 --> 59:43.797
If there was a way, don't you
think I'd have found it?

59:43.841 --> 59:47.409
Frizzlebuns, I'm not sure
you could tell your belly button

59:47.453 --> 59:48.933
from a hole in the ground.

59:48.976 --> 59:50.804
Now, Benny The Easter Bunny

59:50.848 --> 59:52.545
and that bag of feathers
named Henrietta

59:52.589 --> 59:54.852
got out of here somehow.

59:54.895 --> 59:56.767
I want to know how.

59:56.810 --> 1:00:00.248
The Easter Bunny was here
in The Land of the
Holiday Misfits?

1:00:00.292 --> 1:00:05.036
-Huh, I never saw him.
-You saw him
and you know it, Frizzlebuns.

1:00:05.079 --> 1:00:09.649
Nope, not me! And if he got out
of here, I have no idea how.

1:00:09.693 --> 1:00:12.347
So it looks like
you're stuck forever.

1:00:12.391 --> 1:00:15.655
Now if you'll excuse me
I have an appointment to keep.

1:00:15.699 --> 1:00:17.614
An appointment with whom?

1:00:17.657 --> 1:00:21.269
My friend The Great Prince,
we're having a mad party.

1:00:21.313 --> 1:00:24.272
Hnhu, and he's gonna play
the Pan flute, toodle-loo.

1:00:24.316 --> 1:00:25.534
[music]

1:00:27.014 --> 1:00:29.060
[Benny] Okay, you guys,
if we were smart about this

1:00:29.103 --> 1:00:31.366
we can still deliver
Easter baskets

1:00:31.410 --> 1:00:34.021
to each and every kid out there.

1:00:34.065 --> 1:00:36.589
And no one will ever know

1:00:36.633 --> 1:00:39.592
that Easter was
almost lost this year.

1:00:39.636 --> 1:00:42.160
Oh, Benny, it's late.

1:00:42.203 --> 1:00:44.510
Do you really think
we can do it all?

1:00:44.553 --> 1:00:46.468
After the great teamwork
we pulled off

1:00:46.512 --> 1:00:47.905
in The Land
of the Holiday Misfits

1:00:47.948 --> 1:00:50.472
I know we can, Hen.

1:00:50.516 --> 1:00:53.171
I have no idea
what you're talking about

1:00:53.214 --> 1:00:56.783
but you know I can fly fast,
and I'll help any way I can.

1:00:56.827 --> 1:01:00.482
Before we continue,
let me just say, you two

1:01:00.526 --> 1:01:04.269
are the best friends
an Easter Bunny could ask for.

1:01:04.312 --> 1:01:06.793
I couldn't do half of this
without you guys.

1:01:06.837 --> 1:01:10.057
Ha, coolax, where do we start?

1:01:10.101 --> 1:01:13.365
With our maps and--
and we travel smart

1:01:13.408 --> 1:01:15.715
to make up lost time
as we know the earth

1:01:15.759 --> 1:01:19.414
is encircled
by six major wind belts,

1:01:19.458 --> 1:01:22.809
three in each hemisphere.
Starting at the North Pole,

1:01:22.853 --> 1:01:27.248
we ride the polar easterlies
down, catch the westerlies,

1:01:27.292 --> 1:01:31.513
and then we hop to the
tradewinds to finish up by dawn.

1:01:31.557 --> 1:01:33.341
[jolly music]

1:01:33.385 --> 1:01:36.170
[Henrietta] I still can't
believe we did it, Benny.

1:01:36.214 --> 1:01:38.607
We escaped The Land
of the Holiday Misfits,

1:01:38.651 --> 1:01:42.437
saved Easter from the clutches
of Bad Clyde and his gang,

1:01:42.481 --> 1:01:44.570
and delivered gift baskets

1:01:44.613 --> 1:01:48.269
to each and every boy and girl
around the world.

1:01:48.313 --> 1:01:51.708
I need a massage,
a pedi, and some cornmeal.

1:01:51.751 --> 1:01:54.362
We did it, ha ha,

1:01:54.406 --> 1:01:57.757
and that's all that matters.

1:01:57.801 --> 1:01:59.150
[music]

1:02:01.065 --> 1:02:06.070
O-ho-ho-ho.
How did Easter go, guys?

1:02:06.113 --> 1:02:08.159
It came off without a hitch.

1:02:08.202 --> 1:02:11.205
We delivered
each and every Easter basket

1:02:11.249 --> 1:02:13.512
to the very last one.

1:02:13.555 --> 1:02:16.167
That warms my heart, Benny.

1:02:16.210 --> 1:02:19.692
I shudder to think
of a world without Easter.

1:02:19.736 --> 1:02:22.042
Well, you'll never have
to think of it again

1:02:22.086 --> 1:02:26.786
-'cause Easter's here to stay.
-Hear, hear!

1:02:26.830 --> 1:02:31.051
Santa, we-- we heard about
all you guys did in our absence

1:02:31.095 --> 1:02:34.533
and-- and I just
want to say thank you.

1:02:34.576 --> 1:02:36.840
Yeah, thanks a bunch, you guys.

1:02:36.883 --> 1:02:40.104
Don't mention it, ho-ho-ho.

1:02:40.147 --> 1:02:43.237
Both of you would
have done the same for us.

1:02:43.281 --> 1:02:46.327
I am certain of it and besides,

1:02:46.371 --> 1:02:49.766
we Holiday icons
have to stick together.

1:02:49.809 --> 1:02:51.158
You got that right.

1:02:51.202 --> 1:02:53.987
Gargaff, I had no idea
you were a wizard

1:02:54.031 --> 1:02:56.685
at magic spells
and incantations.

1:02:56.729 --> 1:02:57.817
Neither did I.

1:02:57.861 --> 1:02:59.297
He's not kidding.

1:02:59.340 --> 1:03:01.429
We all just found out,

1:03:01.473 --> 1:03:04.258
and even then,
it took some convincing.

1:03:04.302 --> 1:03:08.088
And all this time
I thought it was only good

1:03:08.132 --> 1:03:10.612
for guiding my sleigh
through the night.

1:03:10.656 --> 1:03:12.353
Gee, thanks, Santa.

1:03:12.397 --> 1:03:16.923
He-hey, guiding my sleigh
is a task in itself, reindeer.

1:03:16.967 --> 1:03:20.448
And no one
could do it like you do.

1:03:20.492 --> 1:03:21.841
If not for Gargaff,

1:03:21.885 --> 1:03:25.845
I'd have hit
a mountainside years ago.

1:03:25.889 --> 1:03:28.848
That's quite the vote
of confidence, Gargaff.

1:03:28.892 --> 1:03:31.155
He's just hoping we'll
get into one more adventure

1:03:31.198 --> 1:03:34.506
before settling in at the North
Pole for a few months of R&R.

1:03:34.549 --> 1:03:37.291
Well-deserved R&R, I might add.

1:03:37.335 --> 1:03:40.468
Truer words
have never been spoken.

1:03:40.512 --> 1:03:42.296
Indeed.

1:03:42.340 --> 1:03:45.299
Benny, Henrietta,
it's been a pleasure

1:03:45.343 --> 1:03:48.433
getting to spend this time
with you this season.

1:03:48.476 --> 1:03:51.088
Hopefully, we can
do it again soon,

1:03:51.131 --> 1:03:55.788
maybe over my Christmas Holiday
ho-ho-ho.

1:03:56.789 --> 1:03:59.836
And maybe without the evil
spells and those close calls.

1:03:59.879 --> 1:04:02.186
I'll second that, Gargaff.

1:04:02.229 --> 1:04:03.230
And third.

1:04:03.274 --> 1:04:04.536
And fourth.

1:04:04.579 --> 1:04:06.886
Like Mrs. Claus always says,

1:04:06.930 --> 1:04:11.848
"The reindeer is the brains
of the operation." Ho-ho-ho.

1:04:11.891 --> 1:04:13.501
I mean [chuckles]
she's not wrong.

1:04:13.545 --> 1:04:17.070
She's never wrong,
just ask her. Ho-ho-ho.

1:04:17.114 --> 1:04:19.812
Seeing each other again
sounds nice, Santa.

1:04:19.856 --> 1:04:22.597
Maybe we'll swing by
the North Pole next winter.

1:04:22.641 --> 1:04:26.558
Yeah, after we come back
from our Land of the Holiday
Misfits vacation.

1:04:26.601 --> 1:04:28.386
What? That's a joke, right?

1:04:28.429 --> 1:04:30.301
No, she's being serious.

1:04:30.344 --> 1:04:32.433
But we, but you-- you--

1:04:32.477 --> 1:04:34.783
Why would you ever
want to go back there?

1:04:34.827 --> 1:04:37.961
We made some really nice friends
when we were there.

1:04:38.004 --> 1:04:39.571
You should meet them.

1:04:39.614 --> 1:04:41.834
Nooo, thank you.

1:04:41.878 --> 1:04:46.883
I think Gargaff's had
enough adventuring
for a good while, Henrietta.

1:04:46.926 --> 1:04:50.538
Tell you what, old boy
that's enough
flying for a while.

1:04:50.582 --> 1:04:53.498
What say we head
north back to The Pole

1:04:53.541 --> 1:04:56.109
and I have Mrs. Claus boil us

1:04:56.153 --> 1:04:59.808
some of that scrumptious
hot chocolate for us.

1:04:59.852 --> 1:05:03.116
Here we go.
Bye, Benny, bye, Henrietta.

1:05:03.160 --> 1:05:05.945
Easy boy, easy.

1:05:05.989 --> 1:05:09.470
See you next Christmas,
my friends, ho-ho-ho.

1:05:13.518 --> 1:05:17.304
There they go, Hen,
two of a kind.

1:05:17.348 --> 1:05:21.308
They sure are. Friends like
them two are hard to find.

1:05:21.352 --> 1:05:25.399
We'll see them again, hopefully
under calmer circumstances.

1:05:26.444 --> 1:05:29.490
Maybe, I don't know
if my new toy

1:05:29.534 --> 1:05:33.494
-will leave much time
for relaxation.
-What new toy?

1:05:33.538 --> 1:05:36.671
The Great Invisible
Easter Egg of Muffet Land.

1:05:36.715 --> 1:05:38.717
-You're kidding, right?
-No.

1:05:38.760 --> 1:05:39.631
Where is it?

1:05:39.674 --> 1:05:40.588
Right there.

1:05:40.632 --> 1:05:43.548
Get out, really?

1:05:43.591 --> 1:05:45.942
Mm-hm, I grabbed it
back at the lair

1:05:45.985 --> 1:05:48.727
after Gargaff banished
Bad Clyde.

1:05:48.770 --> 1:05:51.991
Whoa, what are you
gonna do with it?

1:05:52.035 --> 1:05:54.689
I don't know,
try out some spells.

1:05:54.733 --> 1:05:57.301
Spells? What spells?

1:05:57.344 --> 1:06:01.958
Hmm, I only know one.

1:06:02.001 --> 1:06:05.396
O Forces of darkness,
opposed to the light.

1:06:05.439 --> 1:06:09.313
O Powers of pain.
O Bearers of fright.

1:06:09.356 --> 1:06:12.446
Oh, no.

1:06:12.490 --> 1:06:14.535
[music]
