[Nicole] Previously on
What About Brian:

00:02.166 --> 00:04.250
- Hi. I'm Summer.
- [all] Hi, Summer.

00:04.333 --> 00:07.542
[gasps] Oh, my God.
I am so sorry. Are you OK?

00:07.625 --> 00:08.625
How about dinner?

00:08.709 --> 00:10.417
It may be time to consider

00:10.500 --> 00:12.291
that your marriage is over.

00:12.375 --> 00:15.583
Tomorrow morning start looking
for a place to live.

00:15.667 --> 00:18.667
- Can't deny you had feelings.
- It was sex. You knew that.

00:18.750 --> 00:19.750
What is going on?

00:19.834 --> 00:21.667
Leviathan's going
a different direction.

00:21.750 --> 00:23.250
You were gonna
take care of it,

00:23.333 --> 00:25.500
- nothing to worry about.
- Nothing you did.

00:25.583 --> 00:29.375
You can buy your game back for
the bargain price of $75,000.

00:29.458 --> 00:32.917
- Dave and I need an investor.
- Come to work for me. Here.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.250
That's not what I'm asking for.
Can I cash out my CDs, my IRA?

00:36.333 --> 00:38.500
[Dave] It's the game.
Someone's grabbing it.

00:38.583 --> 00:41.500
It uploaded to a free site.
I gave Suzanne the password.

00:41.583 --> 00:43.000
It was not my dad's!

00:43.083 --> 00:45.834
It was every penny I had,
and then some!

00:45.917 --> 00:48.834
Angelo's coming home? Oh,
my God! Is that the surprise?

00:48.917 --> 00:51.083
- Pull over, pull over.
- What's going on?

00:51.166 --> 00:52.917
That was police calling
from Angelo's phone.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.208
- Is he OK?
- He's dead.

00:57.625 --> 01:00.458
[Dave] There's this Italian
restaurant, it's a chain.

01:00.542 --> 01:03.875
You know the one.
There's one on La Cienega.

01:03.959 --> 01:06.792
Lots of salads, lots of bread.

01:06.875 --> 01:08.417
Anyway, they have
this commercial

01:08.500 --> 01:11.291
with a big Italian family
eating dinner.

01:11.375 --> 01:13.166
They're just having
a great time.

01:13.250 --> 01:17.583
They're passing the bread,
eating the pasta and laughing.

01:17.667 --> 01:21.125
There's just such a warm,
happy feeling of family.

01:21.208 --> 01:24.834
It's heartwarming.

01:24.917 --> 01:28.458
Every time I see
one of those commercials,

01:28.542 --> 01:31.041
I can't help
but think about Angelo.

01:32.542 --> 01:35.792
Because he hated
those commercials.

01:35.875 --> 01:38.500
You should've seen his face
every time they came on.

01:38.583 --> 01:42.083
He'd start screaming
at the TV in Italian.

01:42.166 --> 01:46.750
I guess he didn't think it was
a real picture of family or...

01:48.208 --> 01:50.667
It was offensive to him.
In some way.

01:50.750 --> 01:52.208
[sobs]

01:52.291 --> 01:55.500
[Dave] Screaming at the TV
made him feel better.

01:56.750 --> 01:59.375
I'm going to miss that.

02:01.083 --> 02:05.834
It's funny when... when tragedy
happens, you swear to yourself

02:05.917 --> 02:08.166
that things are
going to be different,

02:08.250 --> 02:09.625
that you're going to...

02:09.709 --> 02:12.750
...appreciate life more.

02:12.834 --> 02:15.834
"Sneeze the day,"
as Angelo would say.

02:17.709 --> 02:21.625
And you do.
For about a week.

02:21.709 --> 02:24.875
And then you go back to normal
life because you have to.

02:24.959 --> 02:28.583
Well, do me a favor.
Don't do that.

02:30.208 --> 02:32.917
Remember this feeling
that you have right now.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.125
How short life is.
How fragile and unfair.

02:36.208 --> 02:39.917
And use it to inspire yourself.

02:40.959 --> 02:42.333
I think that's
what Angelo'd do.

02:42.417 --> 02:45.083
I know that's what
he'd want us to do.

02:45.166 --> 02:48.625
And if you ever see
one of those commercials...

02:48.709 --> 02:52.959
Turn off your TV
and think of our friend.

02:53.041 --> 02:55.875
- [sobs]
- Thanks.

03:01.333 --> 03:03.000
[Dave] I love you.

03:07.041 --> 03:10.917
- Good job.
- [Jimmy] You did a good job.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.959
Don't do this if you're not
ready, people will understand.

03:15.041 --> 03:18.709
No, it's OK.
I want to do it.

03:25.166 --> 03:28.458
[clears throat, exhales]

03:28.542 --> 03:32.917
Dave's right. Angelo did
hate those commercials.

03:33.000 --> 03:37.125
But it had nothing to do
with his picture of a family.

03:37.208 --> 03:41.291
The truth is that he auditioned
for one and was rejected.

03:45.417 --> 03:48.458
I didn't know what to say, so...

03:48.542 --> 03:52.208
I wrote a list of things
that I love about Angelo.

03:52.291 --> 03:54.959
So here it goes.

04:14.959 --> 04:20.083
This... boy from
a small town in Italy.

04:20.166 --> 04:22.500
He went to the beach
the first day he got here.

04:22.583 --> 04:28.041
He loved the Santa Monica Pier
and the Ferris wheel.

04:28.125 --> 04:31.333
Angelo was just a big kid who

04:31.417 --> 04:34.458
loved soccer and cartoons...

04:35.583 --> 04:37.750
...and me.

So don't feel

...Angelo and I enjoyed
every moment we had together.

04:48.417 --> 04:51.625
I can honestly say
that I have no regrets.

04:54.875 --> 04:56.875
And even though
it's hard knowing that

04:56.959 --> 04:59.792
he'll never get to
see his daughter,

05:01.834 --> 05:05.417
it's comforting knowing that
he'll always live on in her.

Ahh, it's just so strange
that he's gone.

05:33.417 --> 05:34.542
I know.

05:34.625 --> 05:36.041
[Adam] This is
the first person

05:36.125 --> 05:37.542
our age I've known
who's died.

05:37.625 --> 05:39.750
It's actually
my first funeral.

05:39.834 --> 05:41.417
You're lucky.
I think I'm actually

05:41.500 --> 05:44.000
going on double
digits. It's creepy.

05:44.083 --> 05:46.375
All I keep thinking about
is that Angelo died

05:46.458 --> 05:48.458
in a freak one-car-accident

05:48.542 --> 05:51.375
a month after I walked away
from getting hit by a semi.

05:51.458 --> 05:54.041
What was he doing
in Naples?

05:54.125 --> 05:57.500
- Weren't they shooting in Rome?
- Maybe he was on vacation.

05:58.875 --> 06:00.959
I wonder if he knew
what was happening.

06:02.625 --> 06:06.083
You know? If he had time
to think about things.

06:06.166 --> 06:11.000
- How's Nic doing?
- Hmm. Better than
the rest of us.

06:11.875 --> 06:13.250
She's a rock.

06:13.333 --> 06:15.875
Well, I don't think
she should be alone this week.

06:15.959 --> 06:18.500
I worked out a schedule
of who should sleep over.

06:18.583 --> 06:19.959
We can all take shifts.

06:20.041 --> 06:22.333
Deena, I have you
on for tonight.

06:25.333 --> 06:28.291
Seriously. You got to get rid
of that girl. She's insane.

06:28.375 --> 06:30.083
I know, I will. I swear.

06:32.625 --> 06:34.291
Hey, guys.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.458
Oh, no.
None for me. Thanks.

06:38.542 --> 06:40.125
I've been meaning to ask you,

06:40.208 --> 06:43.333
been able to find the dough you
needed to buy back your game?

06:47.375 --> 06:50.125
No. No, not yet.
But we're going to be OK.

06:50.208 --> 06:51.709
OK? We're going to be great.

06:51.792 --> 06:53.291
We got a lot of
irons in the fire.

06:53.375 --> 06:56.333
- Yeah.
- Well, I'm
wishing you the best.

06:56.417 --> 06:58.875
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

06:58.959 --> 07:02.500
Oh, boy. I should
probably get some more trash.

07:04.750 --> 07:07.000
OK, Brian, we both know
what's going on.

07:07.083 --> 07:08.792
It's enough. It's time.

07:08.875 --> 07:12.000
- Time for what?
- It's time for you
to grow up a little.

07:12.083 --> 07:14.959
Come on. Are you really
about to lecture me now? Today?

07:15.041 --> 07:17.625
- The day of Angelo's funeral?
- That's the point.

07:17.709 --> 07:19.500
Your sister's husband just died.

07:19.583 --> 07:23.709
I just wish that you'd see
the big picture for a change.

07:23.792 --> 07:25.500
Thanks for the advice.

07:25.583 --> 07:27.417
- I'm your father.
- Biologically.

07:27.500 --> 07:29.583
Don't act like my friend.
It's too late.

07:29.667 --> 07:33.000
I can't change the past, but I
can help you with your future.

07:33.083 --> 07:35.625
I offered you a job,
the job still stands.

07:35.709 --> 07:37.333
I got to go.

07:37.417 --> 07:39.667
Do me a favor.
Look after your sister.

07:39.750 --> 07:42.208
I'm worried. She's going
through a rough time.

07:42.291 --> 07:44.125
She'll be fine.
Nicole's pretty tough.

07:44.208 --> 07:47.250
I know, but I'm worried. I'm
worried she might fall into...

07:47.333 --> 07:49.583
Fall into what?

07:49.667 --> 07:54.041
Come on. We both know your
mother's mental health history.

07:54.125 --> 07:57.208
Yeah, yeah,
we do know Mom's history.

07:57.291 --> 07:59.667
And we all know
whose fault it was, too.

08:04.709 --> 08:07.542
- Hang in there.
- Thanks.

08:11.500 --> 08:13.291
I'm going to go home
and get some stuff,

08:13.375 --> 08:15.333
I'll be back
to spend the night.

08:15.417 --> 08:18.917
- You really don't have to.
- I know. I want to.

08:20.959 --> 08:22.792
Why don't I give you
a ride home

08:22.875 --> 08:24.583
and we'll switch cars
in the morning.

08:24.667 --> 08:25.875
That's fine.

08:25.959 --> 08:28.792
- OK, I'm going to get my coat.
- I'll get it.

08:31.959 --> 08:35.291
Listen, Karen.
I'm really sorry

08:35.375 --> 08:37.917
because this is
terrible timing,

08:38.000 --> 08:40.375
but I should tell you
before we get too serious.

08:40.458 --> 08:42.875
This day really has made me
think about things.

08:42.959 --> 08:45.083
I don't think
it's going to work out.

08:45.166 --> 08:48.000
You and me. Us.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.166
I was going
to say the same thing.

09:00.166 --> 09:03.250
- You were?
- Yeah.

09:03.333 --> 09:06.792
You know, after hearing how much
Ang and Nic loved each other,

09:06.875 --> 09:11.667
I realized we're forcing it.
Like we have to work too hard.

09:11.750 --> 09:14.417
We get together, we break up,
we get back together.

09:14.500 --> 09:16.125
It's like we're one of those...

09:17.834 --> 09:20.333
- Seesaws.
- No. Never mind.

09:20.417 --> 09:22.291
It's just...

09:24.041 --> 09:27.792
It's not how it should be,
you know? It's not natural.

09:27.875 --> 09:30.125
Um...

09:30.208 --> 09:32.583
Yeah, sure.

09:32.667 --> 09:34.625
But I'm glad
we're on the same page.

09:34.709 --> 09:36.625
Yeah.

09:36.709 --> 09:40.125
- And I hope we can be friends.
- OK.

09:49.625 --> 09:52.917
I'll call you tomorrow. OK.

09:57.542 --> 09:59.458
You have got to
break up with her.

09:59.542 --> 10:01.083
I think I just did.

10:02.583 --> 10:04.000
Deena's waiting.

10:05.208 --> 10:07.959
Dave? You OK?

10:09.417 --> 10:14.375
Bri, what did the urn look like
that Angelo was resting in,

10:14.458 --> 10:16.000
in a wall?

10:16.083 --> 10:18.667
I think it was red,
about a foot high.

10:18.750 --> 10:21.250
Yeah.
Kind of like this one?

10:24.458 --> 10:26.375
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

10:26.458 --> 10:29.750
- That can't be the same one.
- You think it's a coincidence?

10:29.834 --> 10:32.875
- People keep extra urns around?
- Oh, man. This is bad.

10:32.959 --> 10:35.875
Yeah and I saw the funeral guy
put it in a wall and close it.

10:35.959 --> 10:37.083
He did.
He definitely did.

10:37.166 --> 10:39.458
Which means
your sister went back.

10:39.542 --> 10:42.125
Somehow she got the ashes
of her dead husband

10:42.208 --> 10:44.709
and put them
in her own closet.

10:44.792 --> 10:46.125
There's an explanation.

10:46.208 --> 10:48.208
You make it sound
crazy like that.

10:48.291 --> 10:51.333
You think? How'd you put it
so it doesn't sound so crazy?

10:54.583 --> 10:57.125
We cannot tell her.
She doesn't want us to know.

10:57.208 --> 10:58.875
- I'm saying something?
- Yeah!

10:58.959 --> 11:01.917
What am I going to say?
"Hey, you seen Angelo lately?"

- The plan to save Zap Monkey.

12:17.208 --> 12:20.125
The irons, the fire. Everything
you were talking about.

12:20.208 --> 12:23.959
Actually, it's iron. Singular.

12:24.041 --> 12:26.375
I may have exaggerated
to shut my dad up.

12:26.458 --> 12:29.792
I didn't want to hear him tell
me I need to grow up again.

12:29.875 --> 12:33.291
Yeah, we're as grown-up
as he is. Sort of.

12:34.542 --> 12:36.417
All right,
what's the iron? Come on.

12:39.125 --> 12:42.333
That game we started before
Vision State, with the gorilla?

12:42.417 --> 12:44.166
Evolution Revolution?
I loved that.

12:44.250 --> 12:46.041
Good, it's our
last chance.

12:46.125 --> 12:48.667
We pitch it to KC Gaming.
I made the appointment.

12:48.750 --> 12:51.333
You are a genius. I love you!
That's the way to go!

12:51.417 --> 12:53.333
We go in, sell that,
get some money.

12:53.417 --> 12:55.333
- That's the plan.
- I'll do some sketches.

12:55.417 --> 12:57.917
I got a bunch laying around.
It's great.

13:02.750 --> 13:06.000
[Adam] We need a complete
list of all of Angelo's assets.

13:06.083 --> 13:10.792
Real estate, stock,
bonds, savings accounts.

13:10.875 --> 13:12.917
His credit cards
need to be cancelled.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.208
And you need to file
a tax return for him.

13:15.291 --> 13:17.709
Does he have a will?

13:17.792 --> 13:21.166
Not that I know of.
I mean, why would he?

13:24.250 --> 13:26.375
So how you doing, really?

13:28.166 --> 13:29.208
Still hard to get used to

13:29.291 --> 13:33.083
because I wasn't
seeing him every day.

13:33.166 --> 13:37.041
I mean, he would send me
an e-mail every morning.

13:37.125 --> 13:38.875
Sometimes that was
our only contact,

13:38.959 --> 13:41.959
- so it just hasn't sunk in.
- Yeah.

13:43.959 --> 13:47.041
I know it's...

13:47.125 --> 13:50.417
I mean, I feel guilty
even talking about this
with you, but...

13:53.458 --> 13:56.000
I'm having
a hard time with this.

13:57.917 --> 13:58.959
Everyone is.

13:59.041 --> 14:01.125
I don't know how
you gave that speech.

14:01.208 --> 14:03.291
To be honest,
neither do I.

14:03.375 --> 14:06.458
I guess I was kind of numb,
but I...

14:06.542 --> 14:09.667
The thing I kept
telling myself was,

14:09.750 --> 14:12.083
"Angelo had a great life."

14:12.166 --> 14:14.458
He really did. He was happy.

14:14.542 --> 14:19.834
He got married,
we were starting a family.

14:19.917 --> 14:21.875
He finally got a part
in a movie.

14:21.959 --> 14:25.917
He really did do
everything he wanted to do.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.834
How many people can say that?

14:28.959 --> 14:32.750
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

14:32.834 --> 14:35.583
He even started
playing golf with you guys.

14:35.667 --> 14:39.125
That's right. You bought him
that lame hat he always wore.

14:39.208 --> 14:41.291
I thought it looked
kind of cute on him.

14:41.375 --> 14:42.959
I wish I knew
where that thing was.

14:43.041 --> 14:45.959
Anyway, he wore it
just to bug you.

14:46.041 --> 14:47.625
He knew how much
you guys hated it.

14:47.709 --> 14:49.625
Well, he was right.

14:57.667 --> 14:59.917
[Dave sighs]

15:00.000 --> 15:01.834
They're finally down.

15:01.917 --> 15:05.458
Is it me or are kid's books
getting longer?

15:05.542 --> 15:07.041
What's up with that?

15:07.125 --> 15:09.208
It used to be cute bunny,
pet his ears, the end.

15:09.291 --> 15:11.875
Now the bunny has to go to
the store and he's got to

15:11.959 --> 15:13.375
buy food and cook dinner.

15:13.458 --> 15:16.667
The bunny's got parents and
siblings, they all have stories.

15:16.750 --> 15:20.041
- It just never ends
and I'm exhausted.
- Shh, shh.

15:22.875 --> 15:25.000
Thanks for letting me
read to the girls.

15:28.709 --> 15:31.959
- What are we going to do?
- I don't know, Deen.

15:32.041 --> 15:33.875
Because I can't stop
thinking about

15:33.959 --> 15:36.208
what you said
at the funeral.

15:36.291 --> 15:39.083
- And, uh, I just know...
- [girl] Mommy!

15:41.417 --> 15:43.667
- Mommy!
- Ah, you're up.

15:43.750 --> 15:44.875
OK.

15:49.583 --> 15:51.792
Give me a second, OK? Shh.

15:57.041 --> 16:00.917
You know what you said,
um, your eulogy?

16:01.000 --> 16:04.750
Oh, Dave, it was so beautiful.
And you were right.

16:04.834 --> 16:06.875
You know, life is short.

16:06.959 --> 16:10.667
And we should live it
while we can.

16:10.750 --> 16:12.417
I've been thinking
the same thing.

16:12.500 --> 16:16.375
But this...
This isn't life.

16:16.458 --> 16:22.375
- It's just limbo.
- So what are you saying?

16:22.458 --> 16:25.291
Angelo's death has really
shaken everyone up.

16:27.208 --> 16:31.792
But it hasn't changed the way
we felt before it happened.

16:37.166 --> 16:38.959
I think we should
talk to a lawyer.

16:42.917 --> 16:44.625
I guess you're right.

16:53.917 --> 16:56.834
OK, I know you guys didn't
come down here to chat with me.

16:56.917 --> 16:59.333
I got a meeting
in ten minutes, so...

17:01.458 --> 17:04.917
Well, we've been
having issues in our marriage.

17:05.834 --> 17:08.375
Yeah?

17:08.458 --> 17:12.583
And... we want to
explore our options.

17:12.667 --> 17:17.583
- Your options?
- Yeah, we're splitting up.

17:17.667 --> 17:19.375
So we thought we should
talk to a lawyer.

17:19.458 --> 17:22.333
Wait, you're thinking
about getting a divorce?

17:28.041 --> 17:29.458
If you want to explore it,

17:29.542 --> 17:31.291
you're going to
have to say it, people.

17:31.375 --> 17:34.000
Yes, Jimmy. A divorce.

17:34.083 --> 17:36.125
We're thinking
about getting a divorce.

17:37.875 --> 17:40.333
I don't think you should
think about divorce.

17:40.417 --> 17:44.000
- Why?
- It's serious. I mean...

17:44.083 --> 17:47.125
Are you a 100% sure about this?
You thought this through?

17:47.208 --> 17:50.000
Yes, that's all we've done
is thought about it.

17:50.083 --> 17:51.625
And talked about it.

17:51.709 --> 17:56.333
And we went to therapy.
We've argued. We're sure.

17:56.417 --> 18:01.041
We just want know
what we have to do.

18:03.750 --> 18:06.583
If you're
really considering this,

18:06.667 --> 18:10.166
there are steps to be taken
and things to understand.

18:10.250 --> 18:12.000
If we filed today,

18:12.083 --> 18:14.667
there's six months before
anything becomes finalized.

18:14.750 --> 18:16.500
A "cooling off" period.

18:16.583 --> 18:19.125
To make sure this isn't
a heat of the moment thing.

18:19.208 --> 18:23.333
There's a lot of legalities and
paperwork to deal with, so...

18:23.417 --> 18:25.500
You should get separate lawyers.

18:25.583 --> 18:27.208
Yeah, we can work
through all of that.

18:27.291 --> 18:29.709
[Jimmy] I know you
believe that right now,

18:29.792 --> 18:33.250
- but things change.
- We won't let that happen.

18:37.250 --> 18:40.250
[Adam] Ah, there it is. [laughs]

18:43.250 --> 18:45.417
Angelo's stupid hat.

18:46.625 --> 18:48.041
I think it's kind of cute.

18:48.125 --> 18:51.750
Yeah, well, you're the
only one besides Nicole.

18:51.834 --> 18:54.333
I stole this so we
would never see it again.

18:54.417 --> 18:56.667
It's really sweet
to find it for her.

18:56.750 --> 18:58.500
Whoa, whoa!
What is that?

18:58.583 --> 19:01.542
- Your high school yearbook.
- Please don't look at that.

19:01.625 --> 19:04.542
No way, man!
I want to see your picture.

19:07.000 --> 19:11.333
- Oh! Look how cute you were.
- Let's go.
This is embarrassing.

19:11.417 --> 19:13.000
Not until I'm done.

19:13.083 --> 19:16.667
You made me come here
before lunch, I'm going
to take my time.

19:16.750 --> 19:19.709
- Isn't that your friend, Brian?
- Yeah.

19:19.792 --> 19:23.208
- It's his senior page.
- Nice goals for the future.

19:23.291 --> 19:26.750
"Get a sports car,
get married, write a book,
meet Sharon Stone."

19:26.834 --> 19:29.375
- I wonder how he's
doing on those.
- Oh for four.

19:29.458 --> 19:32.291
Ah, here's your senior page.

19:32.375 --> 19:36.375
"Go to Alaska, run a marathon,
throw out the first pitch
at Wrigley Field."

19:36.458 --> 19:40.458
- Yeah, OK, that's enough.
- What? It's adorable.

19:40.542 --> 19:42.583
Yeah, it's depressing, actually.

19:44.166 --> 19:47.041
- Can we just go?
- Sure.

19:47.125 --> 19:48.917
All right.

19:56.166 --> 20:00.083
It's called
Evolution Revolution.

20:03.041 --> 20:05.625
You hear it all the time.
Survival of the fittest.

20:05.709 --> 20:08.667
Here's your chance to prove
that you're the fittest.

20:08.750 --> 20:10.792
This is a game
Darwin would love.

20:12.375 --> 20:14.083
From the dawn of man
to current day.

20:14.166 --> 20:15.709
You begin the game as a chimp.

20:16.959 --> 20:18.959
Your goal is to
get to today. To evolve.

20:19.041 --> 20:23.417
You got to survive
climate changes, predators,
other dominant species.

20:23.500 --> 20:25.709
You have to learn
how to walk upright.

20:25.792 --> 20:27.625
To make fire. To use tools.

20:27.709 --> 20:31.625
It's like Survivor,
but millions of years ago.

20:31.709 --> 20:34.875
- Maybe get Jeff Probst
to do the voice.
- Mm-hmm.

20:38.709 --> 20:42.083
And the higher the level,
the more difficult it gets.

20:42.166 --> 20:46.000
- Right.
- All you want is for
your species to survive.

20:50.125 --> 20:52.917
Yeah, obviously, we haven't
worked it all out yet.

20:53.000 --> 20:56.500
- No.
- I mean, look how long
it took Darwin.

20:56.583 --> 20:58.959
That's right. Took him a while.

21:08.375 --> 21:09.667
[sighs]

21:09.750 --> 21:11.500
- Don't you knock?
- Don't bother.

21:11.583 --> 21:15.500
You don't have to hide it.
I already saw it here
the other day.

21:15.583 --> 21:17.333
You went into my closet?

21:17.417 --> 21:19.917
Why is it here?
How is it here?

21:21.917 --> 21:24.834
After the funeral.
I changed my mind.

21:24.917 --> 21:30.583
I couldn't stand the idea of
Angelo being put in that wall.

21:30.667 --> 21:33.542
It was just so... wrong.

21:33.625 --> 21:38.166
So I went back and I convinced
them to open it back up for me

21:38.250 --> 21:40.208
and I took the urn.

21:45.125 --> 21:47.917
So what? You gonna keep it
in your room all the time?

21:48.000 --> 21:51.583
Maybe. I have no idea
what I'm going to do.

21:51.667 --> 21:54.166
You're kidding, right?

21:54.250 --> 21:56.208
Can we not have this
conversation?

21:56.291 --> 22:00.083
Nic, you should take it back.
This sounds like something
Mom would do.

22:00.166 --> 22:02.709
- I'm not crazy.
- I know. That's not
what I meant.

22:02.792 --> 22:05.709
Put the ashes where they belong.
It'll be good for you.

22:05.792 --> 22:09.083
How do you know what'd be good
for me? Did your husband die?

22:09.166 --> 22:12.291
I get it. You're upset.
You'd feel better if you just...

22:12.375 --> 22:16.125
You know what will make me
feel better? If everybody
would leave me alone.

22:16.208 --> 22:19.125
- You don't mean that.
- Yes, I do! I'm not an invalid.

22:19.208 --> 22:21.250
I don't need
24-hour nursing care!

22:21.333 --> 22:22.750
No one's saying that you do.

22:22.834 --> 22:25.250
But, clearly,
you have some stuff going on.

22:25.333 --> 22:28.583
Shut up, Brian!
Just shut up!

22:28.667 --> 22:31.083
You don't know
anything about this.

22:31.166 --> 22:34.834
You don't know what it's like
to lose somebody you love.

22:34.917 --> 22:37.667
You don't know what
it's like to love at all.

22:37.750 --> 22:39.250
Don't talk about Marjorie,

22:39.333 --> 22:42.917
that was some dumb fantasy
in your head so you wouldn't
grow up.

22:43.000 --> 22:46.792
Wouldn't have to take
responsibility because you
knew it would never happen.

22:46.875 --> 22:49.417
So you could stay poor,
immature Brian!

22:49.500 --> 22:53.625
This has nothing to do
with Marjorie or me.
I'm just trying to help.

22:53.709 --> 22:55.125
Then leave me alone.

22:56.583 --> 22:58.542
Go!

23:11.583 --> 23:14.625
- [bell rings]
- [kids chattering]

23:14.709 --> 23:17.333
Go, fellas, go, fellas!
Go, go, go, go, go!

23:20.875 --> 23:24.458
Hey. What're you doing here?
Is something wrong?

23:24.542 --> 23:27.166
No, nothing's wrong.
I wanted to pick up the girls.

23:27.250 --> 23:31.333
- Take them out for ice cream.
- Oh, we have a play date.

23:31.417 --> 23:34.208
- Oh.
- Maybe you should just

23:34.291 --> 23:36.542
check with me in the future,
before you show up.

23:36.625 --> 23:40.667
Didn't know I needed to check
before I saw my kids. I guess
that's what divorce is about.

23:40.750 --> 23:45.458
Why don't we go inside?
They're probably waiting for us.

23:45.542 --> 23:48.500
So can we consider this
me checking in?

23:48.583 --> 23:52.250
I'd like to pick up
after school, spend the
afternoons with the girls.

23:52.333 --> 23:54.375
That's not going to
work for us, Dave.

23:54.458 --> 23:56.667
The girls and I
have a schedule, too.

23:56.750 --> 24:00.500
If you want to help out,
why don't you try stopping
by in the mornings?

24:00.583 --> 24:04.458
Because I can't do that.
Especially not now since
I'm hustling for work.

24:04.542 --> 24:06.625
I take it the pitch
didn't go so great.

24:06.709 --> 24:10.667
There you go. No. You know what?
Don't worry about it.

24:10.750 --> 24:14.709
- We have to figure
something else out.
- Yeah, or our lawyers will.

24:14.792 --> 24:18.083
I think Jimmy's right.
I think we should get
separate lawyers.

24:24.959 --> 24:27.250
[Jimmy] I know where
you're headed with this.

24:27.333 --> 24:29.709
Look, no. I don't
want you to make a big deal.

24:29.792 --> 24:32.083
- I am telling the truth.
- [knocking]

24:32.166 --> 24:34.667
Let me call you back.
Adam just walked in.

24:34.750 --> 24:37.917
No, I don't want to...
No, I don't...

24:38.000 --> 24:41.375
All right, fine.
I love your hot body. Bye!

24:42.792 --> 24:46.041
- Is that your mother?
- That's funny stuff.

24:46.125 --> 24:48.041
Want to play racquetball
Wednesday?

24:48.125 --> 24:50.792
Uh, I can't. We can
play Friday instead.

24:50.875 --> 24:53.333
They going to announce
these partnerships?

24:53.417 --> 24:57.291
Because it's kind of driving me
crazy. I'd like to know already.

25:11.250 --> 25:12.875
- When?
- Last night.

25:12.959 --> 25:14.333
Are you serious?

25:19.000 --> 25:22.834

- I did.

25:22.917 --> 25:26.542

- Just me. And Richardson.

- I'm sorry, man.

25:28.333 --> 25:30.333

25:32.000 --> 25:37.083
Don't apologize. It's good,
you deserved it. You earned it.

But Richardson over me?

25:40.834 --> 25:44.542
[stammers] I'd really like
to know what they're thinking.

25:46.458 --> 25:49.000
- You want to know, really?
- Yeah.

25:49.083 --> 25:53.458
OK. Well, truth is, you know,
they have their concerns.

25:53.542 --> 25:55.834
You were in a bar fight.
You were in jail.

25:55.917 --> 25:59.542
From their perspective, not
exactly partner material there.

you're back on track.

I told her about the ashes.

a little slack.

26:33.041 --> 26:35.000

26:35.083 --> 26:39.750
You know, Deena and I
are talking about a divorce.

26:41.583 --> 26:43.709
What?

26:43.792 --> 26:46.583
- Don't say anything to anybody.
- No. Of course not.

26:46.667 --> 26:49.291
- You all right?
- I really don't know anymore.

26:49.375 --> 26:53.166
I'm just so confused
about everything, man.
My marriage and work.

26:57.083 --> 27:00.291
I know this is probably
a stupid question, but...

27:02.208 --> 27:05.583

the guys at KC?
- They called this morning.

27:05.667 --> 27:07.333

27:07.417 --> 27:09.750
Wait, do they want to
buy the game?

27:09.834 --> 27:13.458
No, they don't. They don't want
to buy the game. They hated it.

27:14.959 --> 27:16.458
But...

27:17.834 --> 27:19.917

- And I took it.
- You took it?

27:37.291 --> 27:38.709
Yeah, I had to take it, Bri.

27:38.792 --> 27:42.542
But what about this?
What about us?

27:42.625 --> 27:44.709

27:44.792 --> 27:47.834
We can't pay the rent. We let
everybody go. We're in debt.

- We are partners.

28:26.041 --> 28:29.542

your real estate license.

the summer I turned 18.

28:54.917 --> 28:56.500
You told me
I'd thank you for it.

28:56.583 --> 28:59.458
I'm still waiting
for that thank you.

29:01.333 --> 29:06.125
Anyway, I really think this is
the best move for you right now.

29:06.208 --> 29:09.250
I need a job and money and I
appreciate what you're offering.

29:09.333 --> 29:11.125
That's why I took you up on it.

29:11.208 --> 29:14.041
I'm only here until I
figure out the next step.

29:18.583 --> 29:22.500
- So...
- So, you said something to me
on the day of the funeral.

29:22.583 --> 29:26.208
Now I let it slide because
we were there for Nicole,

29:26.291 --> 29:28.125
but I want to talk
about it now.

29:28.208 --> 29:30.875
- I want to talk about
your mother.
- I don't want to.

29:30.959 --> 29:34.458
You said that I was responsible
for her mental health.

29:34.542 --> 29:37.375
- Dad...
- You have a picture
in your mind, son,

29:37.458 --> 29:41.458
of what went on back then.
But it's the wrong picture.
You were ten years old.

29:41.542 --> 29:44.834
- I was eight.
- That's the point.
You were a child.

29:44.917 --> 29:47.417
You have no idea
what was going on then.

29:50.834 --> 29:54.375
You don't remember,
or you choose not to remember,

29:54.458 --> 29:58.041
but your mother was having
those episodes ever since
you were a baby.

29:58.125 --> 30:01.083
She was very ill
long before I left,

30:01.166 --> 30:03.458
something to do with
her chemical makeup.

30:03.542 --> 30:05.500
But you can't
hold me responsible.

30:05.583 --> 30:07.917
You think that makes it OK?

30:08.000 --> 30:10.583
You left someone
who had those kind of problems.

30:10.667 --> 30:11.875
What should I have done?

30:11.959 --> 30:13.917
Put yourself in my place
for a change.

30:14.000 --> 30:18.667
What would you do if
you were married to a woman
you couldn't get through to?

30:18.750 --> 30:22.208
You couldn't communicate with?
I had my life to live.

30:22.291 --> 30:25.542
Sure. There were other women
to marry and leave, right?

30:28.625 --> 30:31.875
Maybe we should
just stick to business.
