00:11.344 --> 00:13.388
<i>So let's look at the statistics.</i>

00:13.471 --> 00:17.560
<i>The United States is home
to 5% of the world's population...</i>

00:19.352 --> 00:22.022
<i>but 25% of the world's prisoners.</i>

00:24.567 --> 00:26.193
<i>Think about that.</i>

00:28.529 --> 00:31.198
<i>A little country with 5%
of the world's population</i>

00:31.281 --> 00:34.785
<i>having 25% of the world's prisoners?</i>

00:34.868 --> 00:35.953
One out of four?

00:36.036 --> 00:40.040
One out of four human beings
with their hands on bars, shackled,

00:40.123 --> 00:43.919
in the world are locked up here,
in the land of the free.

00:46.338 --> 00:49.299
We had a prison population of 300,000
in 1972.

00:49.382 --> 00:53.178
Today, we have a prison population
of 2.3 million.

00:53.261 --> 00:56.724
The United States now has the highest rate
of incarceration in the world.

00:59.226 --> 01:02.145
So, you see, now suddenly
they're in an awakening that,

01:02.229 --> 01:05.608
"Oh, perhaps we need to downsize
our prison system.

01:05.691 --> 01:09.486
It's gotten too expensive.
It's gotten out of hand."

01:09.570 --> 01:15.158
Um, but the very folks
who often express so much concern,

01:15.242 --> 01:19.329
uh, about the cost
and the expanse of the system

01:19.412 --> 01:23.250
are often very unwilling
to talk in any serious way

01:23.333 --> 01:25.878
about remedying the harm
that has been done.

01:28.546 --> 01:32.009
History is not just
stuff that happens by accident.

01:32.092 --> 01:36.596
We are the products of the history
that our ancestors chose, if we're white.

01:36.680 --> 01:39.516
If we are black, we are products
of the history that our ancestors

01:39.600 --> 01:41.310
most likely did not choose.

01:41.393 --> 01:45.063
Yet here we all are together,
the products of that set of choices.

01:45.147 --> 01:48.776
And we have to understand that
in order to escape from it.

01:54.031 --> 01:56.366
<i>The 13th Amendment to the Constitution</i>

01:56.449 --> 02:00.871
<i>makes it unconstitutional
for someone to be held as a slave.</i>

02:00.954 --> 02:03.248
<i>In other words, it grants freedom...</i>

02:06.168 --> 02:08.628
<i>to all Americans.</i>

02:09.545 --> 02:13.967
<i>There are exceptions, including criminals.</i>

02:15.510 --> 02:19.097
<i>There's a clause, a loophole.</i>

02:19.681 --> 02:21.892
<i>If you have that
in the structure,</i>

02:21.975 --> 02:24.561
<i>in this constitutional language,</i>

02:24.645 --> 02:26.897
<i>then it's there to be used as a tool</i>

02:26.980 --> 02:29.608
<i>for whichever purposes
one wants to use it.</i>

02:50.045 --> 02:52.422
<i>One of the things
to bear in mind is that</i>

02:52.505 --> 02:55.342
when we think about slavery,
it was an economic system.

02:55.425 --> 02:59.722
And the demise of slavery
at the end of the Civil War

02:59.805 --> 03:04.101
left the Southern economy in tatters.
Uh, and so this presented a big question.

03:04.184 --> 03:07.104
There are four million people
who were formerly property,

03:07.187 --> 03:10.023
and they were formerly
kind of the integral part

03:10.107 --> 03:12.943
of the economic production system
in the South.

03:13.026 --> 03:14.527
And now those people are free.

03:18.365 --> 03:20.909
<i>And so what do you do with these people?</i>

03:24.162 --> 03:26.164
<i>How do you rebuild your economy?</i>

03:28.166 --> 03:32.755
The 13th Amendment loophole
was immediately exploited.

03:32.838 --> 03:37.259
After the Civil War,
African Americans were arrested en masse.

03:37.342 --> 03:40.553
<i>It was our nation's first prison boom.</i>

03:43.431 --> 03:46.309
<i>You were basically a slave again.
The 13th Amendment says that</i>

03:46.393 --> 03:48.233
"Except for criminals,
everybody else is free."

03:48.311 --> 03:52.232
Well, now if you're criminalized,
that doesn't apply to you.

03:52.315 --> 03:55.235
<i>They were arrested
for extremely minor crimes,</i>

03:55.318 --> 03:58.321
<i>like loitering or vagrancy.</i>

04:00.365 --> 04:03.493
And they had to provide labor

04:03.576 --> 04:07.205
to rebuild the economy
of the South after the Civil War.

04:13.461 --> 04:16.757
<i>What you got after that
was a rapid transition</i>

04:16.839 --> 04:19.384
to a kind of mythology
of black criminality.

04:21.094 --> 04:24.431
<i>Go back and, you know, read the rhetoric
that people used then.</i>

04:25.390 --> 04:27.893
<i>They would say that the Negro
was out of control,</i>

04:27.976 --> 04:30.395
<i>that there's a threat of violence
to white women.</i>

04:32.230 --> 04:34.941
So the same sort of image
that we had of Uncle Remus

04:35.025 --> 04:37.652
<i>and these genial, kind of, black figures</i>

04:37.735 --> 04:44.159
was replaced by this rapacious,
uh, menacing, Negro male evil

04:44.242 --> 04:45.869
<i>that had to be banished.</i>

04:52.167 --> 04:53.836
Birth of a Nation <i>was</i>

04:53.919 --> 04:57.130
<i>just a profoundly important
cultural event.</i>

04:58.631 --> 05:00.550
<i>It's the first major blockbuster film,</i>

05:00.633 --> 05:04.805
hailed for both its artistic achievement
and for its political commentary.

05:04.888 --> 05:07.557
And when it was released,
it had this rapturous response.

05:07.641 --> 05:11.102
<i>You know, there were lines everywhere
that it was being shown.</i>

05:12.229 --> 05:15.148
<i>Birth of a Nation</i> confirmed the story

05:15.232 --> 05:19.777
that many whites wanted to tell
about the Civil War and its aftermath.

05:21.196 --> 05:25.200
<i>To erase defeat and to take out of it
sort of a martyrdom.</i>

05:27.410 --> 05:31.081
Woodrow Wilson, the sitting president,
had a private screening

05:31.164 --> 05:34.292
of it in the White House. He calls it,
"History written with lightning."

05:34.376 --> 05:36.544
And every image you see of a black person

05:36.628 --> 05:39.547
<i>is a demeaned, animal-like image.</i>

05:40.465 --> 05:42.259
<i>Cannibalistic, animalistic.</i>

05:43.551 --> 05:46.679
The image of the African American male.

05:48.181 --> 05:51.768
<i>There's a famous scene
where a woman throws herself off a cliff</i>

05:51.851 --> 05:55.688
<i>rather than be raped
by a black male criminal.</i>

05:56.231 --> 05:59.609
In the film, you see black people
being a threat to white women.

05:59.692 --> 06:04.907
All the myths of black men as rapists
was ultimately stemmed by the reality

06:04.990 --> 06:08.076
that the white political elite
and the business establishment

06:08.160 --> 06:09.369
needed black bodies working.

06:19.212 --> 06:21.965
<i>What we overlook</i>
<i>about</i> Birth of a Nation

06:22.049 --> 06:25.427
<i>is that it was also
a tremendously accurate prediction</i>

06:25.510 --> 06:28.346
of the way in which race
would operate in the United States.

06:40.943 --> 06:44.571
Birth of a Nation
<i>was almost directly responsible</i>

06:44.654 --> 06:46.198
for the rebirth of the Ku Klux Klan.

06:47.907 --> 06:53.288
<i>It had received this romantic,
glowing, heroic portrait.</i>

06:54.998 --> 06:58.376
<i>The Klan never had the ritual
of burning the cross.</i>

06:58.460 --> 07:00.628
<i>That was something
that D.W. Griffith came up with</i>

07:00.712 --> 07:03.006
<i>because he thought
that it was a great cinematic image.</i>

07:04.799 --> 07:07.761
<i>So it was literally
an instance of life imitating art.</i>

07:09.762 --> 07:11.431
The ripples emanate far out

07:11.514 --> 07:14.434
from just the simple fact
that it's a movie

07:14.517 --> 07:16.937
in the early motion picture age.

07:18.646 --> 07:21.649
<i>With the tremendous
burst of popularity</i>

07:21.733 --> 07:25.988
<i>that the Ku Klux Klan</i>
<i>had as a result of</i> Birth of a Nation

07:26.071 --> 07:28.781
came another wave of terrorism.

07:42.129 --> 07:45.298
<i>We had lynchings
between Reconstruction and World War II.</i>

07:45.382 --> 07:49.052
<i>Thousands of African Americans
murdered by mobs</i>

07:49.136 --> 07:52.180
under the idea
that they had done something criminal.

07:52.264 --> 07:55.600
<i>At the National Democratic
Convention in New York in 1924,</i>

07:55.683 --> 07:59.980
<i>it is estimated that at least
350 delegates were Klansmen.</i>

08:00.063 --> 08:03.941
<i>The demographic geography
of this country was shaped by that era.</i>

08:04.026 --> 08:05.943
<i>Now we have African Americans
in Los Angeles,</i>

08:06.028 --> 08:10.573
<i>in Oakland, and Chicago, and Cleveland,
Detroit, Boston, New York.</i>

08:10.657 --> 08:14.077
And very few people appreciate that
the African Americans in those communities

08:14.160 --> 08:18.248
did not go there as immigrants
looking for new economic opportunities.

08:18.331 --> 08:20.667
They went there as refugees from terror.

08:20.750 --> 08:24.129
We didn't just land in Oakland,
in LA, in Compton,

08:24.212 --> 08:27.590
in Harlem, in Brownsville in 2015.

08:27.674 --> 08:30.218
This is generational...
generational trauma.

08:30.301 --> 08:32.804
<i>The letters "KKK"
were carved with a penknife</i>

08:32.886 --> 08:35.765
<i>on the chest and stomach
of this man in Houston, Texas,</i>

08:35.847 --> 08:40.687
<i>after he had been hanged by his knees
from an oak tree and flogged with a chain.</i>

08:42.438 --> 08:45.650
<i>The Chicago Negro boy,
Emmett Till, is alleged</i>

08:45.733 --> 08:51.156
<i>to have paid unwelcome attention
to Roy Bryant's most attractive wife.</i>

09:02.792 --> 09:05.337
<i>And then
when it became unacceptable</i>

09:05.420 --> 09:07.922
<i>to engage in that kind of open terrorism,</i>

09:08.005 --> 09:10.133
then it shifted to something more legal.

09:10.217 --> 09:12.302
Segregation. Jim Crow.

09:13.928 --> 09:18.100
<i>Laws were passed
that relegated African Americans</i>

09:18.183 --> 09:21.061
to a permanent second-class status.

09:25.440 --> 09:30.278
These things really begin to live out
the prophecy that Griffith was making

09:30.362 --> 09:32.239
about the way that race operates.

09:32.322 --> 09:35.283
And this fear of crime
is central to all of this.

09:35.367 --> 09:37.577
Every time you saw a sign
that said "white and colored,"

09:37.660 --> 09:39.913
every time you had to deal
with the indignation

09:40.497 --> 09:42.499
of being told you can't go
through the front door.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.334
Every day you weren't allowed to vote,

09:44.417 --> 09:45.794
weren't allowed to go to school,

09:45.877 --> 09:48.755
you were bearing a burden
that was injurious.

09:52.342 --> 09:54.719
<i>Civil rights activists
began to see the necessity</i>

09:54.802 --> 09:57.180
of building not just
a civil rights movement,

09:57.264 --> 09:58.640
but a human rights movement.

09:58.723 --> 10:01.601
<i>And I think we should start now preparing</i>

10:01.684 --> 10:02.977
<i>for the inevitable.</i>

10:03.060 --> 10:04.146
<i>Yeah!</i>

10:04.229 --> 10:07.607
<i>And let us,
when that moment comes...</i>

10:09.401 --> 10:12.570
<i>go into the situations that we confront</i>

10:12.654 --> 10:18.576
<i>with a great deal of dignity,
sanity and reasonableness.</i>

10:26.251 --> 10:29.129
<i>They want to throw
white children and colored children</i>

10:29.212 --> 10:32.340
<i>into the melting pot of integration,</i>

10:32.424 --> 10:35.177
<i>through out of which
will come a conglomerated,</i>

10:35.260 --> 10:38.596
mulatto, mongrel class of people.

10:38.680 --> 10:41.308
Both races will be destroyed
in such a movement.

10:41.891 --> 10:45.061
<i>We just got a report here
on this end that the students are in.</i>

10:45.978 --> 10:48.981
<i>Negroes were trying
to integrate the bathing beaches.</i>

10:49.065 --> 10:52.527
<i>And the Florida Advisory Committee
to the US Civil Rights Commission</i>

10:52.610 --> 10:57.657
<i>warned that the city was becoming
a racial superbomb with a short fuse.</i>

10:59.492 --> 11:03.246
<i>Civil rights activists
began to be portrayed in the media</i>

11:03.329 --> 11:06.666
and among, you know,
many politicians as criminals.

11:06.749 --> 11:09.669
<i>People who are deliberately
violating the law,</i>

11:09.752 --> 11:12.297
<i>segregation laws
that existed in the South.</i>

11:14.799 --> 11:17.927
<i>For years now,
I have heard the word "wait."</i>

11:18.845 --> 11:23.975
<i>It rings in the ear of every Negro
with piercing familiarity.</i>

11:24.058 --> 11:28.396
<i>This wait has almost always meant never.</i>

11:29.939 --> 11:35.194
<i>Justice too long delayed
is justice denied.</i>

11:36.153 --> 11:39.241
I think that one of the most brilliant
tactics of the civil rights movement

11:39.324 --> 11:41.993
was its transformation
of the notion of criminality.

11:42.702 --> 11:45.747
Because for the first time,
being arrested was a noble thing.

11:47.624 --> 11:51.210
Being arrested by white people
was your worst nightmare.

11:51.294 --> 11:54.088
Still is, uh, for many African Americans.

11:54.171 --> 11:55.172
So what'd they do?

11:55.257 --> 11:59.051
They voluntarily defined a movement
around getting arrested.

11:59.135 --> 12:00.428
They turned it on its head.

12:04.432 --> 12:06.100
<i>If you looked at the history</i>

12:06.183 --> 12:09.103
<i>of black people's
various struggles in this country,</i>

12:09.186 --> 12:13.566
the connecting theme
is the attempt to be understood

12:13.650 --> 12:15.818
<i>as full, complicated human beings.</i>

12:18.446 --> 12:22.534
We are something other than
this, uh, visceral image of criminality

12:22.617 --> 12:26.162
<i>and menace and threat
to which people associate with us.</i>

12:36.047 --> 12:41.177
We're willing to be beaten for democracy,
and you misuse democracy in the street.

12:41.260 --> 12:44.597
Let us lay aside irrelevant differences...

12:45.932 --> 12:47.559
and make our nation whole.

12:51.354 --> 12:53.773
<i>The Civil Rights Act
and the Voting Rights Act said,</i>

12:53.856 --> 12:55.567
<i>"Finally, we admit it."</i>

12:55.650 --> 12:58.152
Though slavery ended in December 1865...

12:59.111 --> 13:03.115
"we took away these people's rights,
and now we're gonna fix it."

13:05.284 --> 13:06.661
<i>For the first time,</i>

13:06.744 --> 13:10.957
you know, promise of equal justice
becomes at least a possibility.

13:11.040 --> 13:14.794
Their cause must be our cause, too.

13:14.877 --> 13:16.754
<i>Unfortunately,
at the very same time</i>

13:16.838 --> 13:21.217
that the civil rights movement
was gaining steam,

13:21.300 --> 13:24.178
crime rates were beginning to rise
in this country.

13:24.261 --> 13:27.724
Crime was increasing
in the baby boom generation

13:27.807 --> 13:30.685
that had emerged
immediately after World War II.

13:30.768 --> 13:31.769
Now they were adults.

13:31.853 --> 13:37.734
So, just through sheer demographic change,
we had an increase in the amount of crime.

13:37.817 --> 13:41.363
And became very easy
for politicians then to say,

13:41.446 --> 13:47.910
um, that the civil rights movement itself
was contributing to rising crime rates,

13:47.994 --> 13:51.664
and that if we were to give
the Negroes their freedom, um,

13:51.748 --> 13:55.460
then we would be repaid,
as a nation, with crime.

13:57.294 --> 14:00.297
<i>The prison population
in the United States was largely flat</i>

14:00.382 --> 14:02.091
<i>throughout most of the 20th century.</i>

14:02.174 --> 14:04.511
<i>It didn't go up a lot.
It didn't come down a lot.</i>

14:04.594 --> 14:07.221
<i>But that changed in the 1970s.</i>

14:07.304 --> 14:09.682
And in the 1970s, we began an era

14:09.766 --> 14:13.895
which has been defined by this term,
"mass incarceration."

14:13.978 --> 14:18.065
This is a nation of laws,
and as Abraham Lincoln has said,

14:18.149 --> 14:21.528
"No one is above the law.
No one is below the law."

14:21.611 --> 14:23.446
And we're going to enforce the law

14:23.530 --> 14:27.241
and Americans should remember that,
if we're going to have law and order.

14:48.220 --> 14:53.393
<i>Each moment in history
is a fleeting time, precious and unique.</i>

14:53.476 --> 14:56.521
<i>But some stand out
as moments of beginning...</i>

14:57.480 --> 15:03.528
<i>in which courses are set
that shape decades or centuries.</i>

15:03.611 --> 15:06.113
<i>This can be such a moment.</i>

15:07.698 --> 15:12.829
It's with the Nixon era,
and the law and order period

15:12.912 --> 15:16.416
when crime begins to stand in for race.

15:16.499 --> 15:19.669
If there is one area
where the word "war" is appropriate,

15:19.752 --> 15:21.838
it is in the fight against crime.

15:21.921 --> 15:24.340
Part of what he talked about
was a war on crime.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.968
But that was one of those code words,

15:27.051 --> 15:29.471
what we might call
"dog-whistle politics" now,

15:29.554 --> 15:31.222
which really was referring to

15:31.305 --> 15:34.601
the black political movements of the day,
Black Power, Black Panthers,

15:34.684 --> 15:35.935
<i>the antiwar movement,</i>

15:36.018 --> 15:38.563
<i>the movements for women's
and gay liberation at that time,</i>

15:38.646 --> 15:41.608
which Nixon felt compelled
to fight back against.

15:41.691 --> 15:45.903
Once the federal government,
through the FBI, moves into an area,

15:45.987 --> 15:48.740
this should be warning
to those who engage in these acts

15:48.823 --> 15:52.494
<i>that they eventually
are going to be apprehended.</i>

15:52.577 --> 15:55.162
<i>There's this outcry
for law and order.</i>

15:55.997 --> 15:59.333
And Nixon becomes the person
who articulates that perfectly.

15:59.416 --> 16:03.254
<i>There can be no progress
in America without respect for law.</i>

16:03.337 --> 16:06.298
Many people felt like, uh,
we were losing control.

16:07.967 --> 16:11.596
<i>We need total war
in the United States</i>

16:11.679 --> 16:15.432
against the evils, uh,
that we see in our cities.

16:17.143 --> 16:20.897
<i>Federal spending
for local law enforcement will double.</i>

16:20.980 --> 16:22.439
<i>Time is running out
for the merchants</i>

16:22.524 --> 16:25.151
<i>of crime and corruption
in American society.</i>

16:26.318 --> 16:29.697
The wave of crime is not going to be
the wave of the future

16:29.781 --> 16:32.074
<i>in the United States of America.</i>

16:32.158 --> 16:34.994
We must wage
what I have called "total war"

16:35.077 --> 16:38.540
against public enemy number one
in the United States,

16:38.623 --> 16:39.957
the problem of dangerous drugs.

16:40.041 --> 16:41.626
"A war on drugs."

16:41.709 --> 16:46.172
And that utterance gave birth to this era,

16:46.255 --> 16:49.717
where we decided to deal
with drug addiction and drug dependency

16:49.801 --> 16:52.428
as a crime issue
rather than a health issue.

16:52.512 --> 16:54.681
Hundreds of thousands of people

16:54.764 --> 16:57.433
were sent to jails and prisons
for simple possession of marijuana,

16:57.517 --> 16:59.310
for low-level offenses.

17:00.978 --> 17:06.733
America's public enemy number one
in the United States is drug abuse.

17:07.694 --> 17:09.779
In order to fight and defeat this enemy,

17:09.862 --> 17:14.325
it is necessary to wage
a new, all-out offensive.

17:15.660 --> 17:19.288
This call for law and order
becomes integral to something that

17:19.371 --> 17:22.374
<i>comes to be known
as the Southern strategy.</i>

17:22.458 --> 17:26.753
<i>Nixon begins to recruit Southern whites,
formerly staunch Democrats,</i>

17:26.838 --> 17:29.215
<i>into the Republican fold.</i>

17:29.298 --> 17:31.300
<i>Persuading poor
and working-class whites</i>

17:31.383 --> 17:34.637
<i>to join the Republican Party in droves...</i>

17:34.721 --> 17:38.725
By speaking to,
in subtle and non-racist terms...

17:38.808 --> 17:41.143
a thinly veiled racial appeal...

17:41.227 --> 17:42.519
talking about crime,

17:42.604 --> 17:46.733
by talking about law and order
or the chaos of our urban cities

17:46.816 --> 17:48.484
unleashed by the civil rights movement.

17:48.568 --> 17:51.278
<i>We have launched
an all-out offensive against crime,</i>

17:51.362 --> 17:54.281
against narcotics,
against permissiveness in our country.

17:54.365 --> 17:57.034
<i>The rhetoric of
"get tough" and "law and order,"</i>

17:57.118 --> 18:02.164
<i>um, was part and parcel of the backlash
of the civil rights movement.</i>

18:03.332 --> 18:06.127
<i>A Nixon administration official
admitted the war on drugs</i>

18:06.210 --> 18:08.379
was all about
throwing black people in jail.

18:08.462 --> 18:09.463
<i>He said, quote,</i>

19:13.069 --> 19:15.697
Raise your right hand and repeat after me.

19:15.780 --> 19:18.407
I, Ronald Reagan, do solemnly swear...

19:18.490 --> 19:20.827
I, Ronald Reagan, do solemnly swear...

19:20.910 --> 19:23.537
that I will faithfully
execute the Office...

19:23.620 --> 19:28.876
The election of Ronald Reagan was, uh,
in many ways, transformative,

19:28.960 --> 19:30.837
in a negative sense.

19:30.920 --> 19:34.423
President Richard Nixon
was the first to coin the term

19:34.506 --> 19:35.842
"a war on drugs,"

19:35.925 --> 19:40.722
but President Ronald Reagan turned
that rhetorical war into a literal one.

19:40.805 --> 19:43.474
It's back to school time
for America's children.

19:43.557 --> 19:47.103
And while drug and alcohol abuse
cuts across all generations,

19:47.186 --> 19:49.521
it's especially damaging
to the young people

19:49.605 --> 19:51.315
<i>on whom our future depends.</i>

19:51.398 --> 19:56.403
The modern war on drugs was declared
by Ronald Reagan in 1982.

19:56.487 --> 19:59.115
As we mobilize for this national crusade,

19:59.198 --> 20:02.576
I'm mindful that drugs
are a constant temptation for millions.

20:02.660 --> 20:04.870
Popular opinion polls of the day

20:04.954 --> 20:07.915
show that it wasn't an issue
for most people in the United States.

20:07.999 --> 20:09.834
But Reagan was determined

20:09.917 --> 20:12.628
to put this onto the agenda
to define it as a problem.

20:12.712 --> 20:15.798
A war against drugs
is a war of individual battles.

20:15.882 --> 20:19.593
Reagan used his wife, for example,
in this "Just Say No" campaign.

20:19.676 --> 20:24.431
<i>She has helped so many of our young people
to say no to drugs.</i>

20:24.515 --> 20:26.934
<i>Nancy, much credit belongs to you.</i>

20:27.018 --> 20:28.310
This is your brain.

20:29.270 --> 20:30.897
This is drugs.

20:36.443 --> 20:38.195
This is your brain on drugs.

20:38.279 --> 20:39.446
I joined it.

20:39.530 --> 20:42.366
And some people said,
"Well, how can you join

20:42.449 --> 20:46.287
a person declaring a war on drugs,
someone like Ronald Reagan?"

20:46.370 --> 20:50.958
I joined with Nancy Reagan
because she said, "Just say no."

20:51.042 --> 20:55.254
Just say no so loud
that everyone around you can hear it.

20:55.337 --> 20:58.715
We're talking about a general education
that we're talking about.

20:58.800 --> 21:00.802
We're not talking about locking up people.

21:00.885 --> 21:05.306
We're talking about educating people.
We're talking about prevention.

21:05.389 --> 21:07.767
There was a crisis
in the US economy at that time.

21:07.850 --> 21:11.062
I regret to say
that we're in the worst economic mess

21:11.145 --> 21:12.729
<i>since the Great Depression.</i>

21:12.814 --> 21:14.982
There is a frontal assault

21:15.066 --> 21:19.195
on institutions that are designed
to assist human beings,

21:19.278 --> 21:23.950
<i>on the education system, welfare,
on jobs, healthcare.</i>

21:24.033 --> 21:27.829
Government programs that can't be paid for
out of a balanced budget

21:27.912 --> 21:30.331
must be paid for out of your pocket.

21:30.414 --> 21:33.459
<i>The rich are getting richer
and the poor are getting poorer.</i>

21:33.542 --> 21:37.171
The idea of expanding, uh,
the freedom of American business

21:37.254 --> 21:38.589
and the entrepreneurial class...

21:38.672 --> 21:43.219
We will save $1.8 billion
in fiscal year 1982.

21:43.302 --> 21:46.263
<i>Luxury stores like
Neiman Marcus predicts record sales.</i>

21:46.347 --> 21:49.225
<i>The number of Americans
dipping under the poverty level</i>

21:49.308 --> 21:51.685
<i>has reached the highest rate
in two decades.</i>

21:52.269 --> 21:55.898
Yes, there has been
an increase in poverty,

21:55.982 --> 21:59.526
but it is a lower rate of increase
than it was in the preceding years,

21:59.610 --> 22:00.777
before we got here.

22:00.862 --> 22:03.823
It has begun to decline,
but it is still going up.

22:03.906 --> 22:05.157
<i>In the mid-1980s,</i>

22:05.241 --> 22:08.494
we were already starting to embark
on a war on drugs

22:08.577 --> 22:11.956
and then all of a sudden,
along comes this new drug, crack cocaine.

22:12.039 --> 22:15.584
Steve Young reports
on a new kind of cocaine called crack.

22:15.667 --> 22:18.504
It's dangerous. It's deadly.
It will kill you.

22:18.587 --> 22:22.216
"The drug epidemic is as dangerous
as any terrorist that we face."

22:22.299 --> 22:25.302
<i>That is just some of what was said today
to House and Senate committees</i>

22:25.386 --> 22:27.179
<i>holding hearings on drug abuse in America.</i>

22:27.263 --> 22:30.933
<i>We have this drug that
could be marketed in very small doses,</i>

22:31.017 --> 22:32.977
relatively inexpensively,

22:33.060 --> 22:35.437
this was going to just
take over communities,

22:35.521 --> 22:38.232
and particularly
African American communities.

22:38.315 --> 22:42.153
Crack was largely an inner-city issue
and cocaine was largely a suburban issue.

22:42.236 --> 22:45.281
Smokable cocaine,
otherwise known as crack,

22:45.364 --> 22:47.574
<i>it is an uncontrolled fire.</i>

22:47.658 --> 22:50.202
<i>Congress,
in virtually record time,</i>

22:50.286 --> 22:54.039
established
mandatory sentencing penalties for crack

22:54.123 --> 22:57.584
that were far harsher than those
for powder cocaine.

22:57.668 --> 23:01.630
The same amount of time in prison
for one ounce of crack cocaine

23:01.713 --> 23:03.757
<i>that you get for 100 ounces
of powder cocaine.</i>

23:03.841 --> 23:06.552
<i>Police here are cracking down
on crack dealers.</i>

23:06.635 --> 23:13.559
Usually black or Hispanic, Latino,
they were getting long sentences

23:13.642 --> 23:15.102
for possession of crack.

23:15.185 --> 23:16.465
You're black with crack cocaine,

23:16.520 --> 23:19.148
you goin' to prison
for basically the rest of your life.

23:19.231 --> 23:22.609
Um, and if you're white, you're
pretty much getting slapped on the wrist.

23:22.693 --> 23:26.030
Cocaine... was more
sophisticated.

23:26.113 --> 23:27.990
It was just a powder.

23:28.074 --> 23:31.702
<i>By next year,
our spending for drug law enforcement</i>

23:31.785 --> 23:34.496
will have more than tripled
from its 1981 levels.

23:37.207 --> 23:41.587
All of a sudden, a scythe
went through our black communities,

23:42.129 --> 23:45.967
literally cutting off men
from their families,

23:46.050 --> 23:50.012
literally huge chunks
just disappearing into our prisons,

23:50.096 --> 23:52.514
and for really long times.

23:52.598 --> 23:54.516
<i>Millions of dollars
will be allocated</i>

23:55.351 --> 23:57.353
<i>for prison and jail facilities.</i>

23:57.436 --> 23:59.521
<i>These sorts of disparities
under Reagan</i>

23:59.605 --> 24:03.859
quickly exploded
into the era of mass incarceration.

24:03.942 --> 24:06.445
What Reagan ultimately does is...

24:06.528 --> 24:10.992
takes the problem of economic inequality,

24:11.075 --> 24:16.205
of hypersegregation in America's cities,
and the problem of drug abuse,

24:16.288 --> 24:21.210
and criminalizes all of that
in the form of the war on drugs.

24:21.293 --> 24:24.213
We absolutely should have treated
crack and cocaine,

24:24.296 --> 24:26.215
uh, as exactly the same thing.

24:26.298 --> 24:30.552
I think it was an enormous burden
on the black community,

24:30.636 --> 24:33.889
but it also fundamentally violated
a sense of core fairness.

24:33.972 --> 24:37.393
When crack cocaine hit
in the early '80s,

24:37.476 --> 24:40.562
there were a lot of mayors who felt
very strongly that this is a real threat

24:40.646 --> 24:41.981
and they wanted to crack down.

24:42.064 --> 24:45.234
And Rangel was one of the guys
pushing for stronger sentencing.

24:45.317 --> 24:48.445
It may have seemed
like a good idea at the time,

24:48.529 --> 24:51.240
but it sure didn't work out
as being effective.

24:51.323 --> 24:54.535
Then, years later,
there was an effort to rewrite history,

24:54.618 --> 25:00.374
that it was a racial disparity
put in by mean white people.

25:00.958 --> 25:02.501
Um, it's not where it came from.

25:02.584 --> 25:06.172
In many ways,
the so-called war on drugs

25:06.255 --> 25:09.091
was a war on communities of color,

25:09.175 --> 25:14.596
a war on black communities,
a war on Latino communities.

25:14.680 --> 25:18.600
And you see a rhetorical war that was,
you know,

25:18.684 --> 25:22.271
announced as part of a political strategy
by Richard Nixon

25:22.354 --> 25:26.233
and which morphed into a literal war
by Ronald Reagan,

25:26.317 --> 25:32.073
um, turning into something
that began to feel nearly genocidal

25:32.156 --> 25:34.700
in many poor communities of color.

25:34.783 --> 25:37.203
<i>So Nixon's Southern strategy</i>

25:37.286 --> 25:40.289
<i>was implemented right after
the civil rights movement.</i>

25:40.372 --> 25:41.707
<i>He played on fear of crime,</i>

25:41.790 --> 25:44.751
<i>and law and order
to win the election easily.</i>

25:46.337 --> 25:48.630
<i>Reagan promised tax cuts to the rich,</i>

25:48.714 --> 25:51.300
<i>and to throw all the crack users in jail,</i>

25:51.383 --> 25:53.969
<i>both of which devastated
communities of color</i>

25:54.053 --> 25:56.472
<i>but were effective
in getting the Southern vote.</i>

25:59.100 --> 26:03.354
There's really no understanding
of our American political culture

26:03.437 --> 26:05.189
without race at the center of it.

26:05.272 --> 26:08.901
<i>And in 1981,
just before Reagan assumed the presidency,</i>

26:08.984 --> 26:11.487
<i>his campaign strategist, Lee Atwater,</i>

26:11.570 --> 26:15.199
<i>was caught on tape
explaining the Southern strategy.</i>

26:15.282 --> 26:17.326
<i>In other words, you start out...</i>

27:30.607 --> 27:33.694
<i>The war on drugs had become
part of our popular culture,</i>

27:33.777 --> 27:35.362
<i>in television programs like</i> Cops.

27:38.156 --> 27:41.702
When you cut on your local news at night,
you see black men

27:41.785 --> 27:44.288
being paraded across the screen
in handcuffs.

27:45.747 --> 27:48.750
Black people, black men
and black people in general,

27:48.834 --> 27:53.755
<i>are overrepresented in news as criminals.</i>

27:53.839 --> 27:56.675
When I say overrepresented,
that means they are shown as criminals

27:56.758 --> 27:58.302
more times than is accurate,

27:58.385 --> 28:02.138
that they are actually criminals, right,
based on FBI statistics.

28:03.056 --> 28:06.768
I mean, I'm a big believer
in the power of media

28:06.852 --> 28:09.771
<i>full of these clichés
that basically present</i>

28:09.855 --> 28:12.816
<i>mostly black and brown folks
who seem like animals in cages,</i>

28:12.899 --> 28:16.069
and then someone
can turn off the TV thinking...

28:16.152 --> 28:17.488
"It's a good thing for prisons,

28:17.571 --> 28:20.366
because, otherwise, those crazy people
would be walking on my block."

28:20.449 --> 28:23.619
Creating a context
where people are afraid.

28:23.702 --> 28:25.537
And when you make people afraid,

28:25.621 --> 28:28.624
you can always justify
putting people in the garbage can.

28:28.707 --> 28:30.876
Chances are you could run into a kid

28:30.959 --> 28:33.629
waiting to relieve you
of your purse or wallet.

28:33.712 --> 28:36.340
Every media outlet in the country
thinks I'm less than human.

28:36.423 --> 28:41.177
I began to hear the word "super predator"
as if that was my name.

28:41.261 --> 28:42.512
Super predator.

28:42.596 --> 28:44.973
- <i>Super predator.</i>
- "Super predators," end quote.

28:45.056 --> 28:48.143
That's the word they used
to describe this generation,

28:48.227 --> 28:50.520
<i>and it was very, very effective.</i>

28:50.604 --> 28:52.356
Experts call them super predators.

28:52.439 --> 28:55.025
They are not just gangs of kids anymore.

28:55.108 --> 28:58.820
They are often the kinds of kids
that are called super predators.

28:58.904 --> 29:00.656
No conscience, no empathy.

29:00.739 --> 29:02.491
<i>A group of kids growing up</i>

29:02.574 --> 29:05.201
<i>essentially fatherless,
godless and jobless.</i>

29:05.285 --> 29:06.411
For me, what's disturbing

29:06.495 --> 29:08.747
is the degree to which black people
bought into that.

29:08.830 --> 29:12.167
Animals, beasts that needed
to be controlled.

29:12.960 --> 29:15.337
When those grandmothers say,
"But he's a good boy.

29:16.422 --> 29:19.215
He never did anything,"
don't you believe it.

29:19.299 --> 29:20.842
<i>Black communities began</i>

29:20.926 --> 29:24.430
to actually support policies
that criminalized their own children.

29:24.513 --> 29:27.223
<i>Last night, the eight teens
accused of the attack</i>

29:27.308 --> 29:30.143
<i>were arraigned on charges of rape
and attempted murder.</i>

29:30.227 --> 29:34.564
<i>In the Central Park jogger case,
they put five innocent teens in prison,</i>

29:34.648 --> 29:35.899
<i>because the public pressure</i>

29:35.983 --> 29:38.777
<i>to lock up these quote, unquote animals
was so strong.</i>

29:38.860 --> 29:41.447
You better believe
that I hate the people

29:41.530 --> 29:44.366
that took this girl
and raped her brutally.

29:44.449 --> 29:46.827
- You better believe it.
<i>- Donald Trump wanted to give</i>

29:46.910 --> 29:48.370
<i>these kids the death penalty,</i>

29:48.454 --> 29:51.332
<i>and he took out a full page ad
to put the pressure on.</i>

29:52.082 --> 29:55.043
<i>These children, four of them under 18,</i>

29:55.126 --> 29:58.297
<i>all went to adult prisons
for six to eleven years,</i>

29:58.380 --> 30:02.050
<i>before DNA evidence proved
they were all innocent.</i>

30:02.133 --> 30:04.553
We make them their crime.
That's how we introduced them.

30:04.636 --> 30:06.116
"That's a rapist. That's a murderer."

30:06.179 --> 30:08.223
That's a robber.
That's a sex offender.

30:08.307 --> 30:10.559
"That's a burglar.
That's a gang leader."

30:10.642 --> 30:13.895
And through that lens,
it becomes so much easier

30:13.979 --> 30:16.857
to accept that they're guilty
and that they should go to prison.

30:18.400 --> 30:23.989
The objective reality is...
that virtually no one who is white

30:24.656 --> 30:29.453
understands the challenge
of being black in America.

30:29.953 --> 30:36.543
So you have then educated a public,
deliberately, over years, over decades,

30:36.627 --> 30:42.132
to believe that black men in particular,
and black people in general,

30:42.215 --> 30:43.759
are criminals.

30:43.842 --> 30:45.010
I want to be clear,

30:45.093 --> 30:47.693
because I'm not just saying
that white people believe this, right?

30:47.763 --> 30:53.477
Black people also believe this
and are terrified of our own selves.

30:54.061 --> 30:56.855
You want to go back to the days
of military weakness,

30:56.938 --> 30:59.107
caring more about criminals than victims?

30:59.190 --> 31:02.110
We can't risk that.
I'd like your vote on Tuesday.

31:02.194 --> 31:05.572
<i>Leadership that's on your side.
Michael Dukakis for president.</i>

31:05.656 --> 31:07.949
In the midst of the, uh,
presidential campaign,

31:08.033 --> 31:12.954
an ad was released about a person
by the name of Willie Horton.

31:13.038 --> 31:15.749
<i>Bush and Dukakis on crime.</i>

31:15.832 --> 31:18.209
<i>Dukakis not only
opposes the death penalty,</i>

31:18.293 --> 31:21.797
<i>he allowed first degree murderers
to have weekend passes from prison.</i>

31:21.880 --> 31:23.173
<i>One was Willie Horton.</i>

31:23.256 --> 31:28.303
This became a focal point
of an entire presidential campaign.

31:28.387 --> 31:30.514
<i>Horton fled,
kidnapped a young couple,</i>

31:30.597 --> 31:33.224
<i>stabbing the man
and repeatedly raping his girlfriend.</i>

31:33.308 --> 31:36.853
<i>Weekend prison passes.
Dukakis on crime.</i>

31:36.937 --> 31:40.774
Dukakis had protected the program,
vetoed an effort to repeal it,

31:40.857 --> 31:43.985
in that he favored letting murderers
out on the weekend.

31:44.069 --> 31:46.738
<i>That Dukakis
had a double-digit lead over Bush</i>

31:46.822 --> 31:50.451
before the campaign
focused on Willie Horton,

31:50.534 --> 31:54.079
and after that, Bush overtook Dukakis
and won the election.

31:54.162 --> 31:58.083
<i>Which candidate for president
can you count on to be tough on crime?</i>

31:58.166 --> 31:59.668
<i>George Bush.</i>

31:59.751 --> 32:04.548
Bush won the election by creating fear
around black men as criminal,

32:04.631 --> 32:07.092
without saying that's what he was doing.

32:07.175 --> 32:10.345
A very racially, um...

32:10.429 --> 32:13.765
you know, divisive moment.

32:13.849 --> 32:16.477
Depicting an African American criminal,
I think, was deliberate

32:16.560 --> 32:18.311
on the part of that campaign.

32:18.394 --> 32:20.105
There's no one who can tell me otherwise.

32:20.188 --> 32:23.942
Liberals call him Willie Horton to make it
sound like you're being dismissive.

32:24.443 --> 32:28.655
Original article was <i>Reader's Digest.</i>
William Horton, no picture.

32:28.738 --> 32:30.699
The Democrats want you to know
he's black.

32:31.658 --> 32:32.826
Thanks, Grover.

32:35.161 --> 32:37.080
It was not his name,

32:37.163 --> 32:40.709
it was his image
that was sensationalized.

32:40.792 --> 32:44.546
Liberals that announced that it was mean
to pick on a murderer and a rapist

32:44.630 --> 32:47.799
lose all credibility on this discussion.
They just lose it.

32:47.883 --> 32:48.967
And people go,

32:49.050 --> 32:51.650
"We don't want to hear anything else
you have to say about crime."

32:51.720 --> 32:54.139
No matter what anybody says
or what anybody does,

32:54.222 --> 32:59.227
they know exactly what button
they were trying to hit with that ad.

32:59.311 --> 33:01.563
<i>Stabbing the man
and raping his girlfriend.</i>

33:01.647 --> 33:07.861
It went to a kind of primitive fear,
a primitive American fear,

33:07.944 --> 33:13.158
because Willie Horton
was metaphorically the black male rapist

33:13.241 --> 33:16.119
<i>that had been a staple
of the white imagination</i>

33:16.202 --> 33:18.246
<i>since the time just after slavery.</i>

33:20.874 --> 33:24.252
<i>Here was a black man
convicted of rape.</i>

33:25.045 --> 33:28.882
<i>"I will be the savior and protector
of the white population."</i>

33:28.965 --> 33:35.305
Never minding the fact that the history
of interracial rape in this country,

33:35.388 --> 33:41.352
that that record is far more marked
by white rape against black women

33:41.436 --> 33:43.772
than of black men against white women.

33:55.075 --> 33:56.159
Patsey.

34:00.330 --> 34:05.126
<i>This idea
that had such great artistic utility</i>

34:05.210 --> 34:07.629
<i>in 1915 in</i> Birth of a Nation

34:07.713 --> 34:10.215
<i>still had a great deal
of political utility</i>

34:10.297 --> 34:11.842
almost at the end of that century.

34:11.925 --> 34:18.098
The way that we appeal to voters'
sense of fear and anxiety in our nation

34:18.181 --> 34:20.350
runs through black bodies.

35:03.935 --> 35:07.230
<i>A new generation
of Democrats, Bill Clinton and Al Gore.</i>

35:07.314 --> 35:09.441
<i>They don't think the way
the old Democratic party did.</i>

35:09.524 --> 35:13.153
<i>They've sent a strong signal to criminals
by supporting the death penalty.</i>

35:13.236 --> 35:18.574
Looking at the way in which
Democrats were defeated in 1988,

35:18.659 --> 35:21.995
<i>or they were defeated in 1984,
or they were defeated in 1980,</i>

35:22.078 --> 35:24.497
there comes to be a sentiment
among the Democrats

35:24.580 --> 35:29.044
that they have to adopt a position
that is much more, uh, kind of, centrist.

35:29.127 --> 35:30.879
It became virtually impossible

35:30.962 --> 35:34.549
for a politician to run
and appear soft on crime.

35:34.633 --> 35:37.343
I was not for the bill
that he was talking about

35:37.427 --> 35:39.554
because it was not tough enough
on the criminal.

35:39.638 --> 35:42.432
<i>In an environment
where everybody's doing the same thing,</i>

35:42.515 --> 35:44.434
<i>everybody's competing
to be tough on crime,</i>

35:44.517 --> 35:46.728
you quickly all end up in the same space,

35:46.812 --> 35:49.690
so it doesn't become a political advantage
unless you do something more.

35:49.773 --> 35:52.025
We need more police on the street.

35:52.108 --> 35:54.628
There is a crime bill which would
put more police on the street,

35:54.694 --> 35:57.447
which was killed for this session
by a filibuster in the Senate,

35:57.530 --> 35:59.825
mostly by Republican senators.

35:59.908 --> 36:03.578
We'd consistently had,
"Squishy, soft liberal won't protect you.

36:03.662 --> 36:06.873
Tough, conservative will protect you."
And we won that fight every time.

36:06.957 --> 36:09.876
And by the late '80s, early '90s,
people like Bill Clinton

36:09.960 --> 36:12.921
had begun to figure out
they had to be able to match us.

36:13.004 --> 36:17.718
I will faithfully execute the Office
of President of the United States.

36:17.801 --> 36:20.971
Bill Clinton is trying to figure out

36:21.054 --> 36:25.475
how he can deal with a country
that's still basically Reagan's country,

36:25.558 --> 36:28.186
but he's trying to govern as a Democrat.

36:28.269 --> 36:33.108
Violent crime and the fear it provokes
are crippling our society.

36:33.191 --> 36:37.653
Then some high-profile,
very horrendous crimes take place.

36:37.738 --> 36:41.700
Residents pull together
in the search for 12-year-old Polly Klaas.

36:41.783 --> 36:44.619
They are now coping with the discovery
of her body over the weekend.

36:44.703 --> 36:50.125
<i>Polly Klaas, abducted from
her bedroom at home and ultimately killed,</i>

36:50.208 --> 36:53.837
which led to the California
"three strikes and you're out" law.

36:53.920 --> 36:56.089
When you commit a third violent crime,

36:56.172 --> 36:58.967
you will be put away
and put away for good.

36:59.050 --> 37:01.552
Three strikes and you are out.

37:01.636 --> 37:03.679
A person's convicted
of their third felony,

37:03.764 --> 37:07.475
<i>essentially that person is mandated
to prison for the rest of their lives.</i>

37:07.558 --> 37:10.353
<i>So many third-strike defendants
awaiting trial,</i>

37:10.436 --> 37:12.063
<i>the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department</i>

37:12.147 --> 37:16.359
<i>is forced to release 4,200
misdemeanor inmates every month</i>

37:16.442 --> 37:19.570
<i>to make room for incoming
three-strike prisoners.</i>

37:19.654 --> 37:21.823
It's in line with many other policies
we've created,

37:21.907 --> 37:23.616
<i>particularly mandatory minimums.</i>

37:23.699 --> 37:27.453
"Mandatory sentencing." We said
we were no longer going to let judges

37:27.537 --> 37:29.831
consider the circumstances around a crime.

37:29.915 --> 37:32.250
We're just going to impose
a mandatory sentence.

37:32.333 --> 37:33.893
And that's a difficult thing for judges

37:33.919 --> 37:37.756
because they are trying
to dispense justice on a daily basis

37:37.839 --> 37:39.715
and are unable to do so.

37:39.800 --> 37:44.262
<i>In many California communities,
all civil trials have been canceled</i>

37:44.345 --> 37:46.222
<i>to catch up
with the criminal case workload.</i>

37:46.306 --> 37:49.184
<i>We've taken discretion
away from judges,</i>

37:49.267 --> 37:51.394
arguably the most neutral party
in the court,

37:51.477 --> 37:53.897
and given it over to prosecutors.

37:53.980 --> 38:00.737
Ninety-five percent of elected prosecutors
throughout the United States are white.

38:00.821 --> 38:04.950
Serious, violent criminals
serve at least 85% of their sentence.

38:05.033 --> 38:07.786
<i>We passed Truth in Sentencing
that kept people imprisoned</i>

38:07.869 --> 38:09.204
<i>for 85% of their sentence.</i>

38:09.287 --> 38:12.665
<i>Truth in Sentencing.
You're sentenced to an amount of time.</i>

38:12.748 --> 38:14.125
<i>The public wants to be confident</i>

38:14.209 --> 38:17.087
<i>that you're gonna do
just about every bit of that time.</i>

38:17.170 --> 38:19.005
We've done away with parole.

38:19.089 --> 38:24.177
So, in the federal system, when you get
20 years or 30 years, that's what you got.

38:24.260 --> 38:25.929
We had parole in this country

38:26.012 --> 38:29.057
as a mechanism for getting people
out of jails and prisons

38:29.140 --> 38:31.860
when it was clear that they were
no longer a threat to public safety.

38:31.935 --> 38:35.521
Sharanda has spent the last 16 years
in prison, and she'll die there,

38:35.605 --> 38:37.899
because she was sentenced
to life without parole.

38:37.983 --> 38:39.985
Her only crime?
Transporting cocaine.

38:40.068 --> 38:42.904
And when I say "only crime,"
I mean only crime.

38:42.988 --> 38:44.739
She had no other arrests. None.

38:44.823 --> 38:50.703
The judge was required...
required to send Sharanda away for life.

38:50.787 --> 38:53.832
<i>Longer sentences,
three strikes and you're out,</i>

38:54.332 --> 38:58.419
almost 60
new capital punishment offenses...

38:58.503 --> 39:00.588
<i>And then comes the Congress</i>

39:00.671 --> 39:06.344
with a proposal for a $30 billion
federal crime bill of 1994

39:06.427 --> 39:10.515
that was heavily loaded towards
law enforcement incarceration.

39:10.598 --> 39:13.935
I propose a 21st century crime bill

39:14.018 --> 39:16.354
to deploy
the latest technologies and tactics

39:16.437 --> 39:19.190
<i>to make our communities even safer.</i>

39:19.274 --> 39:21.276
That omnibus crime bill was responsible

39:21.359 --> 39:24.779
for a massive expansion
of the prison system.

39:24.863 --> 39:29.450
<i>And beyond that, it provided all kinds
of money and perverse incentives</i>

39:29.534 --> 39:31.953
for law enforcement
to do a lot of the things

39:32.037 --> 39:34.164
that we nowadays consider to be abusive.

39:34.247 --> 39:39.044
It will be used to build prisons to keep
100,000 violent criminals off the street.

39:39.127 --> 39:42.713
<i>Not only does he increase
funding to states to build prisons</i>

39:42.797 --> 39:46.301
<i>to lock up as many people
involved in drug crimes,</i>

39:46.384 --> 39:49.804
but also to put
100,000 police officers on the street.

39:49.888 --> 39:55.726
Crime has been a hot political issue
used too often to divide us.

39:55.810 --> 39:58.438
What President Clinton did in 1994

39:58.521 --> 40:02.317
is actually far more harmful
than his predecessors

40:02.400 --> 40:05.111
because he actually built
that infrastructure that we see today,

40:05.195 --> 40:10.951
the militarization all the way down
to small, rural police departments

40:11.034 --> 40:13.078
that have SWAT teams.

40:13.161 --> 40:15.163
<i>And again we see
this kind of notching up</i>

40:15.246 --> 40:18.416
<i>of the number of people who were
being arrested at every level</i>

40:18.499 --> 40:22.712
<i>and this kind
of exploding prison population.</i>

40:24.672 --> 40:26.882
<i>We are a nation
that professes freedom,</i>

40:26.967 --> 40:31.137
yet we have this mass incarceration,
this hyperincarceration,

40:31.221 --> 40:35.016
uh, that is trawling into it,
grinding into it,

40:35.100 --> 40:37.102
our most vulnerable citizenry,

40:37.185 --> 40:40.271
and is overwhelmingly biased
towards people of color.

40:51.992 --> 40:54.077
<i>But I want to say
a few words about it.</i>

40:56.955 --> 41:00.124
Because I signed a bill
that made the problem worse.

41:00.625 --> 41:02.418
And I want to admit it.

41:02.502 --> 41:06.922
His 1994 crime bill, something
that he now admits was a mistake...

41:07.007 --> 41:08.799
There were longer sentences.

41:10.843 --> 41:15.140
And most of these people
are in prison under state law,

41:15.223 --> 41:18.226
but the federal law set a trend.

41:20.353 --> 41:22.647
And that was overdone.
We were wrong about that.

41:22.730 --> 41:27.902
Well, I think it's important
that President Clinton, um, acknowledges

41:27.986 --> 41:34.700
that things didn't turn out exactly
as he and all of us would've wished.

41:34.784 --> 41:38.579
I'm happy that he realizes
the error of his ways.

41:38.663 --> 41:41.791
I think he knew back then that
it wasn't good policy, I'll be honest.

41:41.874 --> 41:46.004
Back then, there was an outcry
over the rising crime rate.

41:46.087 --> 41:50.091
And people from all communities
were asking that action be taken.

41:50.175 --> 41:54.095
Now, my husband said
at the NAACP last summer

41:54.179 --> 41:57.932
that it solved some problems,
but it created other problems,

41:58.016 --> 41:59.100
and I agree.

41:59.184 --> 42:02.353
I'm glad to see that he is apologetic,

42:02.437 --> 42:06.024
but I think he has to take responsibility
and accountability for that,

42:06.107 --> 42:07.317
and so does Hillary,

42:07.400 --> 42:10.445
because she supported it,
then and up until recently.

42:10.528 --> 42:14.990
<i>Bill Clinton faced off against
a group of Black Lives Matter protestors</i>

42:15.075 --> 42:17.577
<i>protesting a 1994 crime bill</i>

42:17.660 --> 42:21.247
<i>that they say led to a surge
in the imprisonment of black people.</i>

42:21.330 --> 42:24.083
I don't know how you would characterize

42:24.167 --> 42:28.963
the gang leaders who got
13-year-old kids hopped up on crack

42:29.047 --> 42:34.260
and sent 'em out onto the street
to murder other African American children.

42:34.344 --> 42:37.888
Maybe you thought they were good citizens.
She didn't.

42:37.972 --> 42:39.599
She didn't!

42:39.682 --> 42:44.437
You are defending the people
who kill the lives you say matter.

42:44.520 --> 42:45.855
<i>Tell the truth.</i>

42:46.356 --> 42:48.858
We can't ignore the reality of force here.

42:48.941 --> 42:52.112
The policies
that Bill Clinton put forward,

42:52.195 --> 42:54.739
you know, mandatory minimums,
three strikes...

42:54.822 --> 42:57.242
Those were a use of political force.

42:57.325 --> 42:59.160
They forced millions of people,

42:59.244 --> 43:02.413
who would not otherwise
be in prison today, into prison.

43:02.497 --> 43:04.374
They forced families to be broken.

43:04.457 --> 43:06.834
They forced children
to live without their parents.

43:06.917 --> 43:07.960
That's what happened.

43:15.301 --> 43:16.385
<i>Why?</i>

43:18.429 --> 43:21.766
We shouldn't ask,
"Why is Bill Clinton so strong?"

43:21.849 --> 43:24.394
We should ask,
"Why is the black community so weak

43:24.477 --> 43:26.521
in our inability to defend ourselves?"

43:26.604 --> 43:31.192
Let's not forget how many martyrs
we put in the ground in the '60s and '70s.

43:31.276 --> 43:35.863
Let's not forget how many of our leaders
had to leave the country or are in prison.

43:35.946 --> 43:40.034
You stripped out
a whole generation of leadership.

43:40.118 --> 43:42.828
You ran them out the country,
you put them in prison,

43:42.912 --> 43:45.540
you put them in... in cemeteries.

43:45.623 --> 43:48.083
And then you unleash this blitzkrieg,

43:48.168 --> 43:50.753
and we don't have the ability
to defend ourselves.

43:50.836 --> 43:56.884
You can tell the story
of white leadership in America

43:56.967 --> 43:59.011
and never mention the FBI one time.

43:59.095 --> 44:03.057
You can't tell the story
of black leadership, not one,

44:03.433 --> 44:06.561
without having to deal
with the full weight

44:06.644 --> 44:09.689
of the criminal justice system
weaponizing its black dissent.

44:09.772 --> 44:13.484
I'm tired of living every day
under the threat of death.

44:13.568 --> 44:15.570
I have no martyr complex.

44:15.653 --> 44:19.407
I want to live as long
as anybody in this building tonight.

44:19.490 --> 44:23.953
<i>Dr. King, people forget,
was not this beloved figure</i>

44:24.036 --> 44:25.996
<i>that everybody wants to put on a pedestal.</i>

44:26.080 --> 44:29.417
<i>Uh, he was considered one
of the most dangerous people in America</i>

44:29.500 --> 44:32.462
<i>by the head
of the Federal Bureau of Investigations.</i>

44:34.172 --> 44:36.632
Don't tell me
that Dr. King has no relevance

44:36.716 --> 44:38.009
to young brothers in the street.

44:38.092 --> 44:40.720
They dealing with little cops.
He was dealing with the top cop.

44:40.803 --> 44:43.764
We were brought here
against our will.

44:43.848 --> 44:46.934
We were not brought here
to be made citizens.

44:47.017 --> 44:52.482
We were not brought here
to enjoy the, uh, constitutional gifts

44:52.565 --> 44:54.567
that they speak so beautifully about.

44:54.650 --> 44:58.738
<i>Malcolm's whole entourage
was infiltrated with police.</i>

44:58.821 --> 45:00.573
<i>He may have had as many police</i>

45:00.656 --> 45:03.493
as he had regular folk
in his entourage, under cover.

45:03.576 --> 45:05.245
So afraid of black dissent.

45:05.328 --> 45:08.289
FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover
today asserted that the Black Panthers

45:08.373 --> 45:10.750
represent the greatest internal threat
to the nation.

45:11.292 --> 45:12.793
<i>J. Edgar Hoover said</i>

45:12.877 --> 45:17.047
<i>these Panthers represent
the greatest threat</i>

45:17.131 --> 45:19.467
to American democracy at the time.

45:20.885 --> 45:23.846
<i>The Panthers never were that big.</i>

45:23.929 --> 45:26.766
I mean, no one in their right mind
could ever believe

45:26.849 --> 45:29.560
that the Black Panthers
were gonna bring down

45:29.644 --> 45:33.648
the greatest military force
in the history of the world.

45:33.731 --> 45:35.983
The whole movement was criminalized

45:36.066 --> 45:39.236
and destroyed systematically
by the government.

45:39.320 --> 45:41.989
People haven't thought about
what it means to lose a Fred Hampton,

45:42.072 --> 45:45.576
<i>who somehow was able to pull together
blacks and whites</i>

45:45.660 --> 45:48.120
<i>and Puerto Ricans and Native Americans</i>

45:48.203 --> 45:50.831
to fight for justice at 21.

45:50.915 --> 45:53.501
We're going to say it after this
and after I'm locked up

45:53.584 --> 45:55.085
and after everybody's locked up,

45:55.169 --> 45:58.798
that you can jail revolutionaries,
but you can't jail a revolution.

45:58.881 --> 46:00.341
He had to go.

46:00.425 --> 46:05.596
The head of the Black Panthers in Illinois
was killed today by police in Chicago.

46:05.680 --> 46:08.641
<i>Illinois Panther Chairman
Fred Hampton and another Panther leader</i>

46:08.724 --> 46:11.101
<i>from Peoria, Illinois, were killed.</i>

46:11.185 --> 46:13.980
This is where our chairman
had his brains blown out

46:14.063 --> 46:17.900
as he lay in his bed
sleeping at 4:30 in the morning.

46:17.983 --> 46:21.571
<i>They literally went
and shot his whole house up,</i>

46:21.654 --> 46:24.532
<i>with his pregnant wife
next to him in the bed.</i>

46:25.408 --> 46:29.870
So afraid of a leader
that could unite people.

46:29.954 --> 46:31.872
We know the history of folks

46:31.956 --> 46:34.834
who've done this kind of standing up
to these systems,

46:34.917 --> 46:37.545
and we know how the system has
murdered them, assassinated them,

46:37.628 --> 46:42.007
exiled them, excluded them,
or found ways to discredit them.

46:43.551 --> 46:46.554
Assata Shakur was one of the great leaders
of the Black Liberation Army.

46:46.637 --> 46:50.641
That, um, order given by J. Edgar Hoover

46:50.725 --> 46:56.856
was essentially
to destroy any black, progressive...

46:58.190 --> 47:00.568
Third World movement in this country.

47:00.651 --> 47:02.069
<i>They put her in prison,</i>

47:02.152 --> 47:05.280
and her allies said,
"We're not gonna leave her in prison."

47:05.364 --> 47:07.764
Her white allies said,
"We're not gonna leave her in prison."

47:07.825 --> 47:10.745
<i>And pulled her out of prison and got her
to Cuba. She's in Cuba right now.</i>

47:10.786 --> 47:13.748
<i>And within the next five years,</i>

47:13.831 --> 47:19.462
something like, uh, 300 prisons
are in the planning stages.

47:19.545 --> 47:20.921
This government has the intentions

47:21.005 --> 47:24.008
of throwing more and more people
in prison.

47:25.175 --> 47:27.970
<i>Criminalization of Assata Shakur,</i>

47:28.053 --> 47:33.976
the use of the media to represent her
as a dangerous criminal.

47:34.059 --> 47:36.604
And of course, in my own case,

47:36.687 --> 47:42.109
where I was represented by the FBI
as being armed and dangerous.

47:42.192 --> 47:44.945
The FBI has put
black militant Angela Davis

47:45.029 --> 47:47.448
on its list
of the Ten Most Wanted Fugitives.

47:47.532 --> 47:51.452
<i>Then with Angela Davis,
the power of the black intellect...</i>

47:51.535 --> 47:53.454
<i>One thing
that we have to talk about,</i>

47:53.538 --> 47:56.707
coming to grips with,
is this whole question of crime.

47:56.791 --> 48:00.210
What does it mean
to be a criminal in this society?

48:00.294 --> 48:01.671
That had to be broken up.

48:01.754 --> 48:05.466
<i>And in my case, Ronald Reagan
was the governor of California,</i>

48:05.550 --> 48:07.802
<i>Richard Nixon was
the president of the US.</i>

48:07.885 --> 48:12.473
<i>The whole apparatus of the state
was set up against me,</i>

48:12.557 --> 48:16.644
<i>and they really meant to send me
to the death chamber</i>

48:16.727 --> 48:18.395
<i>in order to make a point.</i>

48:18.479 --> 48:21.649
The actions of the FBI
in apprehending Angela Davis,

48:21.732 --> 48:25.319
a rather remarkable, uh, story again...

48:25.402 --> 48:28.072
<i>The system tried
to put the sister on trial,</i>

48:28.155 --> 48:30.908
and the sister said,
"No, we puttin' you on trial."

48:34.244 --> 48:36.664
Comes in, the big Afro,
she didn't go press her hair.

48:36.747 --> 48:38.541
<i>She was facing major time.</i>

48:38.624 --> 48:41.085
You know, most people,
they'd have got a nice little press.

48:41.168 --> 48:44.004
You know? They'd have been
in there with little white gloves on,

48:44.088 --> 48:45.923
praying to Jesus.
She came in like this.

48:46.841 --> 48:51.261
And she devastated the prosecution
and walked out of there free.

48:53.973 --> 48:56.058
<i>But the question is
how do you get there?</i>

48:56.141 --> 48:58.769
Do you get there
by confrontation, violence?

48:58.853 --> 49:00.563
Oh, was that the question you were asking?

49:00.646 --> 49:01.814
Yeah.

49:01.897 --> 49:04.149
So, I grew up in Birmingham, Alabama.

49:04.233 --> 49:05.442
Uh...

49:06.151 --> 49:11.031
Uh, after the four young girls who were...
who lived very...

49:11.115 --> 49:14.118
who lived...
One of them lived next door to me.

49:14.201 --> 49:17.287
I was very good friends
with the sister of another one.

49:17.371 --> 49:19.373
<i>My sister was good friends
with all three of them.</i>

49:19.456 --> 49:22.126
<i>My mother taught one of them in her class.
And they went down.</i>

49:22.209 --> 49:26.672
<i>And what did they find? They found limbs
and heads just strewn all over the place.</i>

49:27.172 --> 49:29.884
<i>I remember,
from the time I was very small,</i>

49:29.967 --> 49:33.763
<i>I remember the sounds of bombs
exploding across the street.</i>

49:33.846 --> 49:35.305
Our house shaking.

49:35.389 --> 49:39.894
I remember my father having to have guns
at his disposal at all times

49:39.977 --> 49:46.108
because of the fact that at any moment
we might expect to be attacked.

49:46.191 --> 49:50.404
I mean, that's why,
when someone asks me about violence, uh...

49:51.446 --> 49:53.991
I just, uh...
I just find it incredible.

49:54.074 --> 49:57.411
Because what it means is that
the person who's asking that question

49:57.494 --> 50:01.165
has absolutely no idea
what black people have gone through,

50:01.248 --> 50:03.543
what black people have experienced
in this country

50:03.626 --> 50:08.130
since the time the first black person
was kidnapped from the shores of Africa.

50:09.048 --> 50:11.717
<i>And when you strip out
a whole generation of leadership,</i>

50:11.801 --> 50:14.804
running folk out the country,
killing folk, framing folk,

50:14.887 --> 50:18.098
you will be vulnerable
to Bill Clinton or anybody else.

50:18.182 --> 50:20.142
They'll do to you what they will.

51:23.080 --> 51:24.874
<i>An armed
neighborhood watch leader</i>

51:24.957 --> 51:28.252
<i>saw Martin walking inside
a gated subdivision near Orlando.</i>

51:28.335 --> 51:30.838
<i>He thought the 17-year-old
looked suspicious.</i>

51:31.463 --> 51:34.299
<i>He's got his hand in his waistband.</i>

51:36.426 --> 51:37.970
<i>And he's a black male.</i>

51:40.264 --> 51:42.516
<i>These assholes,
they always get away.</i>

51:43.684 --> 51:46.186
<i>- Are you following him?
- Yep.</i>

51:46.270 --> 51:49.064
<i>We don't need you to.</i>

51:49.773 --> 51:51.817
<i>Do you think he's yelling "help"?</i>

51:52.151 --> 51:53.861
<i>- Yes.
- All right, what is your...</i>

51:56.155 --> 51:57.906
<i>A deadly shooting in Sanford.</i>

51:57.990 --> 52:00.701
<i>Police have the gun,
they've got the shooter,</i>

52:00.785 --> 52:02.452
<i>but they have not arrested him.</i>

52:03.329 --> 52:05.080
<i>Zimmerman, armed with a gun,</i>

52:05.164 --> 52:08.000
<i>followed this
quote, unquote suspicious kid</i>

52:08.083 --> 52:10.294
<i>after the dispatcher told him not to.</i>

52:11.420 --> 52:13.505
<i>They ended up on the ground in a fight,</i>

52:13.588 --> 52:16.759
<i>and George Zimmerman
shot and killed Trayvon Martin.</i>

52:19.053 --> 52:21.263
<i>The police could not arrest Zimmerman</i>

52:21.346 --> 52:24.266
<i>because of this Florida law called
Stand Your Ground,</i>

52:24.350 --> 52:27.019
<i>which says that you can kill someone
if you feel threatened.</i>

52:27.436 --> 52:29.021
<i>Even though it was Zimmerman</i>

52:29.104 --> 52:32.357
<i>who had pursued Martin
throughout the neighborhood with a gun.</i>

52:32.441 --> 52:38.030
Mr. Zimmerman felt that he,
in self-defense, needed to, uh...

52:38.113 --> 52:39.489
to fire his weapon.

52:39.573 --> 52:41.784
<i>Not only was he not arrested,</i>

52:41.867 --> 52:45.037
<i>but in court,
Zimmerman actually pleaded self-defense</i>

52:45.120 --> 52:47.873
<i>and got off
under the Stand Your Ground law.</i>

52:47.957 --> 52:51.126
We, the jury,
find George Zimmerman not guilty.

52:52.086 --> 52:54.421
<i>That Stand Your Ground law
that was passed in Florida</i>

52:54.504 --> 52:57.257
<i>played a huge role
in the Trayvon Martin tragedy</i>

52:57.341 --> 53:00.677
<i>and this really ignited the movement
that we see today.</i>

53:02.471 --> 53:04.390
<i>In the wake
of Trayvon Martin's death,</i>

53:04.473 --> 53:07.184
<i>Florida's Stand Your Ground law
came into the spotlight.</i>

53:07.267 --> 53:11.146
How did this law not only get in place
in Florida, but around the country?

53:11.230 --> 53:13.774
And all the fingers kept pointing
back to ALEC.

53:16.861 --> 53:19.696
ALEC sounds like the name
of a high school lacrosse player

53:19.780 --> 53:21.949
who just got baked
and wrecked his dad's Saab.

53:22.032 --> 53:26.036
But incredibly, it's actually even worse.

53:26.120 --> 53:30.374
- ALEC is a political lobbying group.
- ALEC is a political lobbying group.

53:30.457 --> 53:32.960
- They write laws...
- They write laws...

53:33.043 --> 53:36.463
- and give them to Republicans.
- And give them to Republicans.

53:36.546 --> 53:38.632
- Stand Your Ground...
- Stand Your Ground...

53:38.716 --> 53:41.343
- was written by ALEC.
- Was written by ALEC.

53:42.052 --> 53:43.846
<i>ALEC is this private club,</i>

53:43.929 --> 53:47.516
<i>and its members are
politicians and corporations.</i>

53:47.599 --> 53:48.934
<i>But the real question is,</i>

53:49.018 --> 53:53.063
<i>should politicians and corporations
be in the same private club?</i>

53:53.147 --> 53:55.107
<i>Under the umbrella of ALEC</i>

53:55.190 --> 53:59.653
<i>corporate members, uh, get to propose laws
to their political counterparts,</i>

53:59.736 --> 54:01.571
<i>most of whom are Republicans.</i>

54:02.406 --> 54:05.910
<i>So, through ALEC, corporations have
a huge say in our lawmaking.</i>

54:05.993 --> 54:07.661
<i>And at ALEC task force meetings,</i>

54:07.744 --> 54:11.706
<i>corporate lobbyists
secretly vote as equals with lawmakers</i>

54:11.791 --> 54:14.001
<i>on bills that those lawmakers
then introduce</i>

54:14.084 --> 54:16.503
<i>to become laws in our states.</i>

54:16.586 --> 54:18.047
ALEC is everywhere.

54:18.130 --> 54:21.091
Roughly one in four state legislators
are members.

54:21.175 --> 54:24.053
And I'm proud to stand with ALEC today.

54:24.136 --> 54:28.015
And it's not hard to see why.
ALEC makes their jobs troublingly easy.

54:28.098 --> 54:30.434
Here's their model
Electricity Freedom bill,

54:30.517 --> 54:33.353
which at one point says,
"Be it therefore enacted,

54:33.437 --> 54:38.358
that the State of repeals
the renewable energy mandate."

54:38.442 --> 54:42.696
So, as long as you can remember
and spell the name of your state,

54:42.779 --> 54:44.698
you can introduce legislation.

54:44.781 --> 54:46.992
We've also seen ALEC bills introduced

54:47.075 --> 54:50.537
where a lawmaker forgot
to take the ALEC letterhead off the bill.

54:50.787 --> 54:52.957
Without remembering to take off
the ALEC letterhead

54:53.040 --> 54:57.502
to try to distance the real role of ALEC
and ALEC corporations from those bills.

54:57.586 --> 54:58.906
I'm just curious. Does it have...

54:58.962 --> 55:01.840
Does the legislation have
some connection to ALEC?

55:01.924 --> 55:06.220
Representative Atkins, I'm not sure why
we're pursuing this course of questioning.

55:06.303 --> 55:08.722
This bill is my bill.
It's not ALEC's bill.

55:08.805 --> 55:12.517
The reason I ask is because
earlier you passed out a handout

55:12.601 --> 55:16.438
that says "Gottwalt" at the top,
and it says "Health Care Compact,"

55:16.521 --> 55:19.399
and there's a logo
right in the middle of that page.

55:19.483 --> 55:21.902
And I went to the ALEC website,

55:21.986 --> 55:27.449
and there's exactly the same font,
the same size and the same logo.

55:27.532 --> 55:29.493
I mean, literally, it's verbatim.

55:29.576 --> 55:30.828
<i>It's shocking to know</i>

55:30.911 --> 55:33.914
<i>that ALEC has been around
for more than four decades now.</i>

55:34.581 --> 55:37.877
<i>And it's even more startling
to see how it began.</i>

55:37.960 --> 55:40.212
<i>ALEC has forged
a unique partnership</i>

55:40.295 --> 55:44.674
between state legislators and leaders
from the corporate and business community.

55:44.758 --> 55:47.761
<i>Corporations have influenced
laws for decades, through ALEC.</i>

55:47.845 --> 55:50.138
They want everybody to vote.

55:50.680 --> 55:52.682
I don't want everybody to vote.

55:52.766 --> 55:56.353
As a matter of fact, our leverage
in the elections quite candidly goes up

55:56.436 --> 55:58.188
as the voting populace goes down.

55:59.148 --> 56:02.276
<i>Nearly every ALEC bill
benefits one of its corporate funders.</i>

56:04.694 --> 56:08.115
<i>And the corporation Wal-Mart
was a long-standing member of ALEC</i>

56:08.198 --> 56:11.911
at the time that it adopted
the so-called Stand Your Ground law.

56:11.994 --> 56:16.540
<i>It's a law that created
an atmosphere where gun sales boomed.</i>

56:16.623 --> 56:19.960
Wal-Mart is the biggest seller
of long guns in the US,

56:20.044 --> 56:23.130
<i>has been the largest retailer
of bullets in the world.</i>

56:24.464 --> 56:26.633
<i>So it's reasonable to think
that Wal-Mart benefited</i>

56:26.716 --> 56:29.136
<i>from these Stand Your Ground laws
that ALEC pushed</i>

56:29.219 --> 56:33.265
that initially prevented the arrest
of the killer of Trayvon Martin, uh,

56:33.348 --> 56:36.726
and was designed to prevent the arrest,
prosecution and conviction

56:36.810 --> 56:40.010
of the killer of Trayvon Martin, including
through changing the jury instructions

56:40.064 --> 56:41.690
to require that a jury be told

56:41.773 --> 56:44.443
that someone like George Zimmerman
has a right to stand his ground,

56:44.526 --> 56:47.529
but not that someone like Trayvon Martin
has a right to stand his ground

56:47.612 --> 56:51.491
against someone like George Zimmerman
with a gun assailing him.

56:57.081 --> 57:00.917
<i>After the outcry over Stand Your Ground
and the Trayvon Martin tragedy...</i>

57:01.001 --> 57:04.421
Wal-Mart stepped out of ALEC.
It left ALEC, abandoned ALEC.

57:04.504 --> 57:06.965
But the Wal-Mart family
continues to fund ALEC.

57:07.049 --> 57:10.219
<i>Other corporations
followed suit and stepped away from ALEC,</i>

57:10.302 --> 57:13.597
<i>but many corporations
are still members, including...</i>

57:13.680 --> 57:16.141
<i>Koch Industries,
State Farm Insurance,</i>

57:16.225 --> 57:19.269
PhRMA, which is the lobbying group
for the pharmaceutical industry.

57:19.353 --> 57:21.855
ALEC has been supported
by the tobacco industry

57:21.939 --> 57:23.773
<i>as well as AT&T and Verizon.</i>

57:23.857 --> 57:25.692
<i>And for nearly two decades,</i>

57:25.776 --> 57:28.195
one corporation was
Corrections Corporation of America.

57:28.778 --> 57:31.531
<i>Every day,
we serve our communities.</i>

57:31.615 --> 57:33.325
<i>From small towns to large cities,</i>

57:33.408 --> 57:36.495
<i>at more than 60 locations
across our country.</i>

57:36.578 --> 57:39.248
<i>As the nation's fifth largest
correctional system,</i>

57:39.331 --> 57:43.793
<i>we build, own and manage
secure correctional facilities.</i>

57:43.877 --> 57:46.380
<i>CCA was the first
private prison corporation in the US.</i>

57:46.463 --> 57:49.341
<i>It started as a small company,
in Tennessee, in 1983.</i>

57:50.425 --> 57:52.636
These folks started
making contracts with states.

57:52.719 --> 57:54.554
And they had to protect their investments,

57:54.638 --> 57:58.225
so the states were required
to keep these prisons filled

57:58.308 --> 57:59.828
<i>even if nobody was committing a crime.</i>

58:00.394 --> 58:03.981
<i>And in the late '80s and early '90s,
this became a growth industry</i>

58:04.064 --> 58:07.317
unlike very few growth industries
in America's history.

58:07.401 --> 58:12.197
Uh, it was absolutely
a model guaranteed to succeed.

58:13.698 --> 58:18.745
<i>And one of the ways we see that
is through the role of CCA within ALEC</i>

58:18.828 --> 58:20.705
to advance a series of bills.

58:20.789 --> 58:22.791
All the legislation you could think of

58:22.874 --> 58:26.628
that we fight so hard against,
"three strikes, you're out..."

58:26.711 --> 58:28.963
Three strikes and you are out.

58:29.048 --> 58:30.715
Mandatory minimum sentencing laws...

58:30.799 --> 58:33.302
serve at least 85% of their sentence.

58:33.385 --> 58:35.554
Were the ones
they were putting out there

58:35.637 --> 58:39.599
like on a premiere
pre-fixed dinner menu,

58:39.683 --> 58:44.229
<i>a steady influx of bodies
to generate the profit</i>

58:44.313 --> 58:46.481
that would go to the shareholders.

58:47.691 --> 58:51.236
<i>Through ALEC,
CCA became the leader in private prisons.</i>

58:51.945 --> 58:56.658
<i>It's a multibillion-dollar business today
that gets rich off punishment.</i>

58:56.741 --> 58:59.661
<i>We are America's leader
in partnership corrections.</i>

58:59.744 --> 59:01.080
<i>We are CCA.</i>

59:01.163 --> 59:02.622
<i>And so, through ALEC,</i>

59:02.706 --> 59:06.293
CCA had a hand in shaping crime policy
across the country,

59:06.376 --> 59:11.173
including, not just prison privatization,
but the rapid increase in criminalization.

59:11.757 --> 59:15.927
I think this accusation, you know,
quite frankly, is just false.

59:16.010 --> 59:21.641
That somehow ALEC was in favor
of imprisoning a bunch of people, uh,

59:21.725 --> 59:23.435
because of private prisons...

59:23.518 --> 59:28.148
I think that's just, unfortunately,
one of these tactics they do on ALEC.

59:28.232 --> 59:32.152
ALEC pushed forward a number of policies
to increase the number of people in prison

59:32.236 --> 59:35.114
and to increase the sentences
of people who are in prison.

59:35.197 --> 59:39.326
I'm trying to think how you address it.
It's hard to address something that's like

59:39.409 --> 59:41.286
almost like folklore at this point.

59:41.370 --> 59:44.414
They are not doing anything
to really clean up that past

59:44.498 --> 59:47.167
or to address the real consequences
for real people

59:47.251 --> 59:48.918
of the extreme policies they've pushed.

59:49.002 --> 59:51.004
In fact, it doesn't talk about
its past history.

59:51.088 --> 59:55.008
I mean, it's hard for me
to even understand, uh,

59:55.092 --> 59:57.469
what they're even talking about.
A lot of it.

59:57.552 --> 01:00:00.805
CCA directly benefited,
directly profited from its investment

01:00:00.889 --> 01:00:03.057
in ALEC,
the American Legislative Exchange Council.

01:00:03.142 --> 01:00:06.520
And the American people, in many ways,
were harmed by these policies

01:00:06.603 --> 01:00:10.023
due to the mass incarceration
of people, particularly people of color.

01:00:10.107 --> 01:00:15.529
Look, right now our position
is that we want less people in prison.

01:00:15.612 --> 01:00:18.823
I don't think that helps the private
prison industry, quite frankly.

01:00:18.907 --> 01:00:20.367
I think myself and the lawmakers,

01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:23.828
we're just always looking for better,
innovative ways to run government.

01:00:23.912 --> 01:00:24.955
I think that's one thing

01:00:25.038 --> 01:00:27.878
as conservatives, who believe in
the free market and limited government,

01:00:27.916 --> 01:00:28.834
we pride ourselves on.

01:00:28.917 --> 01:00:31.211
We're supposed to be
the party of innovation.

01:00:32.045 --> 01:00:36.425
<i>Another bill
that ALEC innovated was SB 1070.</i>

01:00:36.508 --> 01:00:39.303
<i>CCA was on the ALEC task force
that pushed that law</i>

01:00:39.386 --> 01:00:41.763
<i>that gave police
the right to stop anyone</i>

01:00:41.846 --> 01:00:43.807
<i>they thought looked like an immigrant.</i>

01:00:45.642 --> 01:00:47.977
<i>This law filled
immigration detention facilities,</i>

01:00:48.061 --> 01:00:51.148
<i>and it directly benefited
an ALEC member, CCA.</i>

01:00:53.107 --> 01:00:56.695
CCA could potentially reap
huge financial benefits from SB 1070,

01:00:56.778 --> 01:01:01.241
since 1070 was designed to lock up
a lot more people in Arizona

01:01:01.325 --> 01:01:03.577
on federal immigration charges.
Cha-ching!

01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:07.206
<i>An influx of undocumented
immigrants, many of them children...</i>

01:01:07.289 --> 01:01:11.460
<i>In Arizona, Corrections
Corporation of America, or CCA,</i>

01:01:11.543 --> 01:01:14.713
<i>holds the federal contract
to house detained immigrants.</i>

01:01:14.796 --> 01:01:18.883
<i>It's worth more than $11 million
every month.</i>

01:01:20.594 --> 01:01:23.388
Our, uh, immigration facilities
are a disgrace.

01:01:23.472 --> 01:01:28.059
<i>There are families kept there,
uh, in horrible conditions.</i>

01:01:29.018 --> 01:01:32.231
They're called "detention facilities,"
but they're really prisons for immigrants.

01:01:32.314 --> 01:01:34.900
Calling them "detention facility"
doesn't make them not a prison.

01:01:34.983 --> 01:01:36.943
They're a prison.
They just have a different name.

01:01:37.026 --> 01:01:42.073
We're having what some people are saying
is a creation of a "crimmigration" system.

01:01:42.156 --> 01:01:45.702
That there's the merger
of our immigration enforcement

01:01:45.785 --> 01:01:47.954
and our law enforcement system.

01:01:48.037 --> 01:01:51.500
And so, that's some of the same things
that were used in the war on drugs,

01:01:51.583 --> 01:01:53.793
are now migrating to other populations.

01:01:53.877 --> 01:01:58.673
You heard it, uh, with Donald Trump,
not about blacks but with Mexicans.

01:01:58.757 --> 01:02:01.468
You know,
"Oh, well, they're rapists, murderers.

01:02:01.551 --> 01:02:04.137
Oh, and by the way,
some of 'em may be good people."

01:02:05.597 --> 01:02:08.225
Oh, boy. You know, where do you start
on something like that?

01:02:09.601 --> 01:02:13.897
<i>In late 2010, CCA left ALEC
after a big NPR story came out</i>

01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:17.108
<i>accusing ALEC of pushing SB 1070.</i>

01:02:17.442 --> 01:02:20.153
ALEC doesn't do anything on immigration.

01:02:20.237 --> 01:02:24.324
No. No which way. Not to the right,
not to the left. Nothing.

01:02:24.408 --> 01:02:27.160
So, I don't really have anything
for you on that one. Sorry.

01:02:27.244 --> 01:02:30.497
ALEC has recently made
what I would describe as a PR move

01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:32.624
to say that it's gonna be right on crime.

01:02:32.707 --> 01:02:36.044
That it's gonna be on the right side
of criminal justice policy and reform.

01:02:36.127 --> 01:02:41.466
That move comes in the wake of its loss
of a massive number of corporations.

01:02:42.842 --> 01:02:47.681
What ultimately happened is our board
looked at the issues that ALEC worked on

01:02:47.764 --> 01:02:50.183
and decided
that we don't do social issues,

01:02:50.267 --> 01:02:52.352
we're focused on economic issues.

01:02:52.436 --> 01:02:57.691
We jettisoned basically almost
all of our legislation that was pre-2007.

01:02:57.774 --> 01:03:00.694
So we basically...
Fresh slate going forward.

01:03:00.777 --> 01:03:02.570
A fresh start going forward.

01:03:03.154 --> 01:03:05.490
<i>This industry knows that it's dying...</i>

01:03:06.616 --> 01:03:10.620
and is actually preparing
for the next thing.

01:03:10.704 --> 01:03:14.416
And the animating factors that have
led to such a system like bail.

01:03:14.499 --> 01:03:19.379
We're always gonna see
new permutations of a cancer. Right?

01:03:19.463 --> 01:03:20.589
And that's what this is.

01:03:20.672 --> 01:03:23.550
And over the last couple years,
since 2008,

01:03:23.633 --> 01:03:27.637
we've been involved really
in a wholesale reform effort,

01:03:27.721 --> 01:03:32.559
where 31 states have now adopted
positive changes on sentencing,

01:03:32.642 --> 01:03:34.728
on parole and probation reforms.

01:03:34.811 --> 01:03:38.565
ALEC has a concerted effort to privatize
almost every aspect of government,

01:03:38.648 --> 01:03:40.775
but we had no idea
that they were also aiming

01:03:40.859 --> 01:03:43.361
<i>to try to privatize probation and parole.</i>

01:03:43.653 --> 01:03:47.073
ALEC is no longer concerned
about CCA and CCA's interest.

01:03:47.156 --> 01:03:49.618
CCA no longer has
a seat at the table with ALEC,

01:03:49.701 --> 01:03:52.746
so it doesn't have a financial interest
in advancing policies

01:03:52.829 --> 01:03:55.164
<i>that increase the profits of CCA.</i>

01:03:55.248 --> 01:03:57.709
<i>But the American Bail Coalition
is still part of ALEC.</i>

01:03:57.792 --> 01:04:00.504
Today, our state penitentiaries

01:04:00.587 --> 01:04:05.008
are filled to the brim
and overflowing with inmates.

01:04:05.091 --> 01:04:07.886
<i>When I think
of systems of oppression,</i>

01:04:07.969 --> 01:04:11.973
uh, historically, in this country
and elsewhere, they're durable.

01:04:12.056 --> 01:04:15.309
And they tend to reinvent themselves,
and they do it right under your nose.

01:04:15.394 --> 01:04:18.062
One of the things they want to do
is GPS monitoring.

01:04:18.146 --> 01:04:21.358
Having a home confinement system
for juveniles, I think, is a great thing

01:04:21.441 --> 01:04:24.318
'cause it forces the parents
to take responsibility and step up.

01:04:24.403 --> 01:04:27.822
Prisons would be
more embedded in our homes.

01:04:27.906 --> 01:04:30.266
Some of them would be monitored
on GPS and things like that.

01:04:30.324 --> 01:04:34.621
So folks won't be locked up in a cage,
in a cell, inside of an institution,

01:04:34.704 --> 01:04:37.832
but they will have ankle bracelets on.
They'll have wrist bracelets on.

01:04:37.916 --> 01:04:40.960
Would that help to solve
the prison overcrowding problem?

01:04:41.044 --> 01:04:42.211
Absolutely.

01:04:42.295 --> 01:04:46.425
And what I worry about is that
we fall asleep at the wheel and wake up,

01:04:46.508 --> 01:04:49.302
and realize that we may not
have people in prisons

01:04:49.386 --> 01:04:51.304
in rural communities all over America,

01:04:51.388 --> 01:04:54.182
but that we're incarcerating people
right in their communities.

01:04:54.265 --> 01:04:57.852
That is what I see,
what a lot of the focus is on,

01:04:57.936 --> 01:04:59.270
is taking people from prison,

01:04:59.353 --> 01:05:01.690
putting them in community corrections
parole and probation,

01:05:01.773 --> 01:05:04.275
and really investing in those programs.

01:05:04.358 --> 01:05:05.819
How much progress is it really,

01:05:05.902 --> 01:05:10.657
if communities of color are still under
perpetual surveillance and control,

01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:15.662
but now there's a private company
making money off the GPS monitor,

01:05:15.745 --> 01:05:18.623
rather than the person
being locked in a literal cage?

01:05:18.707 --> 01:05:21.751
If we can help you...

01:05:23.253 --> 01:05:26.464
save crime victims
in your legislative district...

01:05:28.007 --> 01:05:29.926
you don't mind me making a dollar.

01:05:31.219 --> 01:05:34.973
<i>And so, ALEC continues
to be a body that,</i>

01:05:35.056 --> 01:05:37.183
<i>while it may have some
really strong rhetoric</i>

01:05:37.266 --> 01:05:41.145
on why it supports
crime reform now, suddenly,

01:05:41.229 --> 01:05:42.772
uh, sort of out of the blue,

01:05:42.856 --> 01:05:45.442
it actually has real financial interests.

01:05:45.525 --> 01:05:47.193
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

01:05:48.778 --> 01:05:53.032
If you're in the prison business,
uh, you don't want reform.

01:05:53.116 --> 01:05:54.476
You may say you do, but you don't.

01:05:54.534 --> 01:05:57.871
And there are a bunch of people out there
desperately trying to make sure

01:05:57.954 --> 01:06:00.874
that that prison population
does not drop one person,

01:06:00.957 --> 01:06:03.835
because their economic model needs that.

01:06:03.918 --> 01:06:09.591
Prison industrial complex refers
to the system of mass incarceration

01:06:09.674 --> 01:06:12.426
and companies that profit
from mass incarceration.

01:06:12.511 --> 01:06:14.763
<i>That includes
both operators of private prisons,</i>

01:06:14.846 --> 01:06:20.184
<i>which get a lot of attention,
as well as a vast sea of vendors.</i>

01:06:20.268 --> 01:06:24.397
From SECURUS Technologies,
that supplies telephone services,

01:06:24.481 --> 01:06:27.817
that made $114 million
in profits last year...

01:06:27.901 --> 01:06:32.280
Those calls to family and friends are
costing a pretty penny in state prisons.

01:06:32.363 --> 01:06:36.242
They inflate the price that they charge
the inmate and the inmate's family.

01:06:36.325 --> 01:06:39.037
<i>For example, in Maryland,
if you earn minimum wage,</i>

01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:42.791
<i>you'd have to work an hour and a half
to afford a ten minute phone call.</i>

01:06:46.169 --> 01:06:50.339
<i>There's also Aramark,
one of the big food service providers.</i>

01:06:50.924 --> 01:06:53.009
<i>In more than one state,
they have been accused</i>

01:06:53.092 --> 01:06:55.887
<i>of having maggots in the food
that they've served.</i>

01:06:59.015 --> 01:07:03.394
Corizon Healthcare provides healthcare
services in 28 different states.

01:07:03.477 --> 01:07:05.855
Multimillion-dollar contracts
for this service.

01:07:05.939 --> 01:07:11.235
Huge incentives given to contractors
for very long contracts,

01:07:11.319 --> 01:07:13.822
so it's actually a disincentive
to provide the service,

01:07:13.905 --> 01:07:15.657
because you're going to be paid anyway.

01:07:22.455 --> 01:07:24.332
One of the reasons it's so difficult

01:07:24.415 --> 01:07:27.710
to talk about mass incarceration
in this country, and to question it,

01:07:27.794 --> 01:07:31.548
is because it has become
so heavily monetized.

01:07:31.631 --> 01:07:33.675
A little company called UNICOR,

01:07:33.758 --> 01:07:36.678
<i>that does $900 million
in business annually.</i>

01:07:36.761 --> 01:07:38.471
How do they do it?

01:07:38.555 --> 01:07:40.264
Volume.

01:07:40.348 --> 01:07:42.433
<i>- Also, prison labor.</i>

01:07:42.517 --> 01:07:45.270
<i>Partnerships between
correctional industries</i>

01:07:45.353 --> 01:07:46.521
<i>and private business</i>

01:07:46.605 --> 01:07:50.567
<i>are a rapidly growing segment of
a multibillion dollar industry in America.</i>

01:07:50.650 --> 01:07:53.653
<i>We talk about sweatshops and we,</i>

01:07:53.737 --> 01:07:58.992
you know, we beat our fists at people
overseas for exploiting poor, free labor,

01:07:59.075 --> 01:08:01.786
but we don't look that it's happening
right here at home every day.

01:08:01.870 --> 01:08:03.537
You have corporations

01:08:03.622 --> 01:08:06.540
who are now invested
in this free labor.

01:08:06.625 --> 01:08:08.710
It's all over.

01:08:08.793 --> 01:08:14.090
It's from sports, uniform,
hats, Microsoft, Boeing.

01:08:14.173 --> 01:08:16.134
<i>Federal inmates are making
the guidance systems</i>

01:08:16.216 --> 01:08:17.457
<i>for the Patriot missile system.</i>

01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:19.763
<i>JCPenney jeans are made in Tennessee.</i>

01:08:19.845 --> 01:08:21.723
<i>Victoria's Secret.</i>

01:08:22.223 --> 01:08:24.600
Anderson flooring wood products
are made in Georgia.

01:08:24.684 --> 01:08:26.770
<i>It's always been Idaho potatoes.</i>

01:08:26.853 --> 01:08:31.733
They're planted, grown, harvested,
packed and shipped by inmates.

01:08:31.816 --> 01:08:35.361
<i>Victoria's Secret and JCPenney
switched suppliers</i>

01:08:35.444 --> 01:08:37.822
<i>once their ties came to light.</i>

01:08:38.113 --> 01:08:42.076
<i>Simply put,
corporations are operating in prisons</i>

01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:44.037
<i>and profiting from punishment.</i>

01:08:45.663 --> 01:08:49.250
Prison industries have gotten so big

01:08:49.332 --> 01:08:52.295
that it's very difficult now
to try and do away with them.

01:08:52.377 --> 01:08:53.546
Too much money out there,

01:08:53.630 --> 01:08:57.341
too many lawmakers that support it
because they're being lobbied.

01:08:57.425 --> 01:09:00.261
So, the public's got to stand up
and take it back.

01:09:00.344 --> 01:09:01.763
It'll never get done if they don't.

01:09:22.241 --> 01:09:23.701
<i>The night of his arrest,</i>

01:09:23.785 --> 01:09:27.037
Kalief Browder was walking home from
a party with his friends in the Bronx,

01:09:27.121 --> 01:09:28.747
<i>when he was stopped by police.</i>

01:09:30.792 --> 01:09:36.089
Kalief was, um, charged with a crime,
a really petty crime,

01:09:36.171 --> 01:09:38.299
that it turns out he didn't commit.

01:09:38.381 --> 01:09:40.676
Then they said,
"We're gonna take you to the precinct,

01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:42.511
and most likely,
we'll let you go home."

01:09:42.595 --> 01:09:45.180
But then, I never went home.

01:09:45.264 --> 01:09:49.185
- They told you that you could post bail.
- Yes, that's correct.

01:09:49.268 --> 01:09:50.644
- $10,000.
- Yes.

01:09:50.729 --> 01:09:53.272
- And, of course...
- I couldn't make that.

01:09:53.356 --> 01:09:54.941
- Hmm.
- My family couldn't pay it.

01:09:55.024 --> 01:09:58.361
There are thousands of people
in jails right this moment

01:09:58.444 --> 01:10:00.780
that are sitting there for no other reason

01:10:00.864 --> 01:10:03.282
than because they're too poor to get out!

01:10:03.366 --> 01:10:05.576
We have a criminal justice system
that treats you better

01:10:05.659 --> 01:10:08.371
if you're rich and guilty
than if you're poor and innocent.

01:10:08.454 --> 01:10:10.957
Wealth, not culpability, shapes outcomes.

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:12.520
I think what most Americans think of,

01:10:12.583 --> 01:10:16.004
'cause they've watched so many
courtroom dramas and things like that,

01:10:16.087 --> 01:10:19.132
they think that the criminal justice
system is about judges and juries.

01:10:19.215 --> 01:10:21.384
Well, that's really
stopped being the case.

01:10:21.467 --> 01:10:26.973
This system simply cannot exist
if everyone decides to go to trial.

01:10:27.056 --> 01:10:28.682
If everybody insisted on a trial,

01:10:28.767 --> 01:10:30.226
<i>the whole system would shut down.</i>

01:10:30.309 --> 01:10:32.603
What typically happens
is the prosecutor says,

01:10:32.686 --> 01:10:35.481
"You know, you can make a deal
and we'll give you three years,"

01:10:35.564 --> 01:10:38.026
or you can go to trial
and we'll get you 30.

01:10:38.109 --> 01:10:40.069
"So, you want to take that chance,
feel free."

01:10:40.611 --> 01:10:42.655
Nobody in the hood goes to trial.

01:10:42.739 --> 01:10:46.075
<i>97% of those people
who were locked up</i>

01:10:46.159 --> 01:10:47.368
have plea bargain.

01:10:48.536 --> 01:10:53.750
And that is one of the worst violations
of human rights

01:10:53.833 --> 01:10:56.127
that you can imagine in the United States.

01:10:56.210 --> 01:10:58.379
We have, in this country,
people pleading guilty

01:10:58.462 --> 01:10:59.881
to crimes they didn't commit,

01:10:59.964 --> 01:11:03.843
just because the thought of going to jail
for what the mandatory minimums are

01:11:03.927 --> 01:11:05.219
is so excruciating.

01:11:05.762 --> 01:11:08.681
<i>Kalief Browder decided,
"I'm not gonna take the plea."</i>

01:11:08.765 --> 01:11:12.601
So, you had to choose between
being in prison for up to 15 years

01:11:12.685 --> 01:11:15.729
and going home right then by admitting
you did a crime you didn't do.

01:11:15.814 --> 01:11:17.023
I felt like I was done wrong.

01:11:17.106 --> 01:11:20.485
I felt like something needed to be done.
I felt like something needs to be said.

01:11:20.568 --> 01:11:24.030
If I just cop out and say that I did it,
nothing's gonna be done about it.

01:11:24.113 --> 01:11:26.074
I didn't do it.
No justice is served.

01:11:26.157 --> 01:11:31.037
What you're not taught is that
if you exercise that right to a trial,

01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:34.290
and you are convicted,
we will punish you more.

01:11:34.373 --> 01:11:36.625
The courts basically punished him

01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:40.254
for having the audacity
to not take a plea deal

01:11:40.338 --> 01:11:41.881
and to want to take it to trial.

01:11:41.964 --> 01:11:43.257
In that time, those three years

01:11:43.341 --> 01:11:46.385
that he was sitting there
and not being charged for anything,

01:11:46.469 --> 01:11:50.139
that's when, um, the mental health issue
started to deteriorate

01:11:50.223 --> 01:11:52.100
<i>and he started to get into fights.</i>

01:11:55.061 --> 01:11:57.230
<i>After a while,
I kept hearing the same thing</i>

01:11:57.313 --> 01:11:58.898
<i>from the whole three years,</i>

01:11:58.982 --> 01:12:02.443
<i>and I just learned to cope
with just being in there,</i>

01:12:02.526 --> 01:12:05.196
<i>and that was rough.
I already knew...</i>

01:12:05.947 --> 01:12:08.074
<i>After a while, I just gave up hope.</i>

01:12:15.498 --> 01:12:19.418
Three years on Rikers Island,
two of that in solitary confinement,

01:12:19.502 --> 01:12:21.254
and he was a child, a baby.

01:12:21.337 --> 01:12:23.422
You miss everything.
Everything about being home.

01:12:23.506 --> 01:12:27.385
The fresh air, your family,
certain events. You want to be home.

01:12:27.468 --> 01:12:29.929
When they give you an offer
to go home right then and there,

01:12:30.013 --> 01:12:32.653
it's like, "I want to go home,"
but then you know you didn't do it,

01:12:32.723 --> 01:12:34.058
so you don't wanna plea,

01:12:34.142 --> 01:12:36.352
take the plea and say that you do it,
it's not right.

01:12:42.275 --> 01:12:45.611
<i>I was scared all day because I didn't know
where it would come from.</i>

01:12:45.694 --> 01:12:48.156
<i>I don't know where any harm would come.</i>

01:12:48.239 --> 01:12:50.199
<i>Kalief suffered through
so many beatings,</i>

01:12:50.283 --> 01:12:53.327
<i>both by the people he was locked up with
and the guards,</i>

01:12:53.411 --> 01:12:56.664
<i>he ended up attempting suicide
on several occasions.</i>

01:12:58.207 --> 01:13:01.335
<i>After almost three years in jail,
waiting his trial,</i>

01:13:01.419 --> 01:13:04.172
<i>they dropped all the charges,
and he was set free.</i>

01:13:07.341 --> 01:13:10.094
<i>He spent two years
in an environment that</i>

01:13:10.178 --> 01:13:13.014
people have argued
is designed to break you within 30 days.

01:13:13.556 --> 01:13:16.684
I mean, I can't really tell you
what's next, but...

01:13:18.561 --> 01:13:20.271
<i>This happens every day.</i>

01:13:21.605 --> 01:13:23.774
<i>Two years after
his release from jail,</i>

01:13:23.857 --> 01:13:27.820
<i>Kalief Browder hanged himself
at his home in the Bronx.</i>

01:13:33.284 --> 01:13:35.369
<i>He was 22 years old.</i>

01:13:50.093 --> 01:13:54.180
If I would've just pled guilty,
then my story would've never been heard.

01:13:54.263 --> 01:13:56.515
Nobody would've took the time
to listen to me.

01:13:56.599 --> 01:13:59.352
I'd have been just another criminal.

01:14:01.770 --> 01:14:04.857
Prison industrial complex,
the system, the industry,

01:14:04.941 --> 01:14:08.027
it is a beast.

01:14:08.111 --> 01:14:11.948
It eats black and Latino people

01:14:12.031 --> 01:14:14.533
for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

01:14:16.785 --> 01:14:19.538
<i>We didn't even think about
who gets the jobs</i>

01:14:19.622 --> 01:14:21.332
<i>of spending time with these folks.</i>

01:14:22.583 --> 01:14:24.961
Otherwise, we'd want
social workers and teachers.

01:14:25.044 --> 01:14:28.714
We'd want people
with understanding of human behavior.

01:14:30.841 --> 01:14:32.385
<i>And we do the opposite.</i>

01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:43.104
<i>You become numb.</i>

01:14:43.187 --> 01:14:46.149
I think that's what jail does to humans.

01:14:46.232 --> 01:14:49.568
That immediate dehumanization
and sensory deprivation

01:14:49.652 --> 01:14:52.780
<i>that nobody can really understand
unless they live through it.</i>

01:14:55.491 --> 01:14:59.620
So the last 14 years,
my son has not had any human contact,

01:14:59.703 --> 01:15:03.041
other than to be handcuffed by an officer.

01:15:03.124 --> 01:15:05.334
Uh, he doesn't even have
a window in his cell,

01:15:05.418 --> 01:15:07.836
and that's one thing
that really disturbs me.

01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:09.047
<i>It troubles me.</i>

01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:12.633
<i>I just couldn't believe it.</i>

01:15:12.716 --> 01:15:14.593
<i>I couldn't believe</i>

01:15:14.677 --> 01:15:18.764
that we would even have such
an architectural design in our country.

01:15:18.847 --> 01:15:21.725
I never realized that there was
prison cells built like that.

01:15:21.809 --> 01:15:26.480
Human beings are not born
to be locked up and encaged.

01:15:26.564 --> 01:15:30.068
<i>Most people wouldn't keep
their pets in the kind of conditions</i>

01:15:30.151 --> 01:15:31.652
<i>that we keep people in.</i>

01:15:31.735 --> 01:15:35.114
Prisons and jails have become warehouses,
in the sense that, um,

01:15:35.198 --> 01:15:37.200
where we've moved as a society is that

01:15:37.283 --> 01:15:41.245
it's not enough
to just deprive you of your liberty.

01:15:41.329 --> 01:15:43.872
Um, but we want to punish you, too.

01:15:43.956 --> 01:15:47.210
Most of the society, um,

01:15:47.293 --> 01:15:50.879
don't understand what it means
to be behind those big gates

01:15:50.963 --> 01:15:52.256
<i>and those barb wires.</i>

01:15:55.884 --> 01:15:59.138
<i>Once somebody is arrested
and convicted, they're gone.</i>

01:15:59.221 --> 01:16:01.307
<i>Nobody particularly cares about them.</i>

01:16:02.225 --> 01:16:05.436
In many ways, the prison systems
are sort of in the dark.

01:16:05.519 --> 01:16:08.981
So it makes it a lot easier,
you know, cognitively and emotionally.

01:16:09.065 --> 01:16:11.442
It makes it a lot easier to say,
"Send people there."

01:16:13.069 --> 01:16:15.863
<i>If you look at the whole problem,
you say, "What are we doing?"</i>

01:16:15.946 --> 01:16:19.158
We have too many laws locking
too many people up for too many things,

01:16:19.242 --> 01:16:22.953
giving them sentences that are too harsh,
putting them in prison,

01:16:23.037 --> 01:16:24.246
and while they're in prison,

01:16:24.330 --> 01:16:26.832
doing very little, if anything,
to rehabilitate them

01:16:26.915 --> 01:16:29.502
so that they can reenter civil society
when they get out.

01:16:29.585 --> 01:16:32.004
And then when they get out, we shun them.

01:16:32.088 --> 01:16:35.508
Over 40,000 collateral consequences

01:16:35.591 --> 01:16:38.219
for people that come through
our criminal justice system.

01:16:38.302 --> 01:16:40.721
It's that question,
"Have you been convicted of a felony?"

01:16:40.804 --> 01:16:42.890
that appears on the job application.

01:16:42.973 --> 01:16:45.643
In some cases, it can affect
your access to student loans.

01:16:45.726 --> 01:16:48.729
They can't get many business licenses,
food stamps if they're hungry.

01:16:48.812 --> 01:16:50.856
Private rentals in regards to housing.

01:16:50.939 --> 01:16:54.110
It's that question
that appears on life insurance.

01:16:54.193 --> 01:16:58.156
The scarlet letter follows you
for the rest of your life in this country.

01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:00.658
<i>In March of 2015,</i>

01:17:00.741 --> 01:17:03.619
<i>we had tens of thousands of people
come to Selma</i>

01:17:03.702 --> 01:17:05.163
<i>to celebrate the 50th anniversary</i>

01:17:05.246 --> 01:17:07.415
of the crossing
of the Edmund Pettus Bridge.

01:17:07.498 --> 01:17:09.583
And very few of those people realized

01:17:09.667 --> 01:17:13.254
that nearly 30% of the black male
population of Alabama today

01:17:13.337 --> 01:17:17.508
<i>has permanently lost the right to vote
as a result of a criminal conviction.</i>

01:17:19.260 --> 01:17:22.138
If you do something wrong,
you should pay it back,

01:17:22.221 --> 01:17:23.847
and then move forward with your life.

01:17:23.931 --> 01:17:27.310
But yet, in America,
there's absolutely zero closure.

01:17:27.393 --> 01:17:32.731
We actually tell American citizens,
when they pay back their debt to society,

01:17:32.815 --> 01:17:35.526
their citizenship
will still be denied from them.

01:17:35.609 --> 01:17:39.863
So many aspects of the old Jim Crow
are suddenly legal again

01:17:39.947 --> 01:17:42.908
<i>once you've been branded a felon.</i>

01:17:42.991 --> 01:17:47.580
And so it seems that in America,
we haven't so much ended racial caste,

01:17:47.663 --> 01:17:49.540
but simply redesigned it.

01:18:10.060 --> 01:18:11.437
We are now in an era

01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:14.607
where Democrats and Republicans alike
have decided

01:18:14.690 --> 01:18:20.571
that it's not in their interest anymore
to maintain the prison system as it is.

01:18:20.654 --> 01:18:21.739
Now, all of a sudden,

01:18:21.822 --> 01:18:24.408
Hillary Clinton is meeting
with Black Lives Matter activists,

01:18:24.492 --> 01:18:25.493
and talking about it.

01:18:25.576 --> 01:18:31.957
It's time to change our approach
and end the era of mass incarceration.

01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:33.834
She's made a major address on it.

01:18:33.917 --> 01:18:39.047
We will reform our criminal justice system
from end to end

01:18:39.131 --> 01:18:45.388
and rebuild trust between law enforcement
and the communities they serve.

01:18:45.471 --> 01:18:48.807
President Obama going to prison, you know,
as the first sitting President

01:18:48.891 --> 01:18:50.100
<i>to ever visit a prison.</i>

01:18:50.183 --> 01:18:52.853
We've got an opportunity to make
a difference at a time when

01:18:52.936 --> 01:18:55.773
overall violent crime rates
have been dropping

01:18:55.856 --> 01:18:57.816
at the same time
as incarcerations last year

01:18:57.900 --> 01:18:59.943
dropped for the first time in 40 years.

01:19:00.027 --> 01:19:04.240
And conservatives, who were always seen
or understood within the narrative

01:19:04.323 --> 01:19:07.743
as being the tough-on-crime ones, um,

01:19:07.826 --> 01:19:10.746
have now embraced justice reform.

01:19:10.829 --> 01:19:13.081
It's very, uh, man bites dog.

01:19:13.165 --> 01:19:18.170
You see, Texas used to spend billions
locking people up for minor offenses.

01:19:18.754 --> 01:19:21.840
We shifted our focus
to diversionary programs,

01:19:21.924 --> 01:19:23.676
like community supervision.

01:19:23.759 --> 01:19:25.010
We got to ask ourselves,

01:19:25.093 --> 01:19:29.056
"Do we feel comfortable with people
taking the lead of a conversation,

01:19:29.139 --> 01:19:31.517
in a moment
where it feels right politically?"

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:38.106
Historically, when one
looks at efforts to create reforms,

01:19:38.190 --> 01:19:43.446
they inevitably lead to more repression.

01:19:43.529 --> 01:19:45.569
So, if we leave it up to them,
what they're gonna do

01:19:45.614 --> 01:19:47.283
is they're gonna tinker with the system.

01:19:47.366 --> 01:19:49.535
They're not gonna do the change
that we need to see

01:19:49.618 --> 01:19:51.537
as a country to get us out of this mess.

01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:53.789
And they're certainly not
gonna go backwards

01:19:53.872 --> 01:19:55.458
and fix the mess that they have made,

01:19:55.541 --> 01:19:57.501
because they're not ready
to make that admission.

01:19:57.585 --> 01:20:01.464
But as a country, I don't think we've
ever been ready to make the admission

01:20:01.547 --> 01:20:04.592
that we have steamrolled
through entire communities

01:20:04.675 --> 01:20:06.469
and multiple generations

01:20:06.552 --> 01:20:09.054
when you think about things like
slavery and Jim Crow,

01:20:09.138 --> 01:20:13.225
and all the other systems of oppression
that have led us to where we are today.

01:20:14.518 --> 01:20:16.729
So much fun! I love it, I love it!

01:20:16.812 --> 01:20:19.064
We havin' a good time?

01:20:19.147 --> 01:20:20.983
USA! USA!

01:20:21.066 --> 01:20:25.153
USA! USA! USA! USA!

01:20:25.237 --> 01:20:27.531
USA! USA! USA! USA!

01:20:27.615 --> 01:20:30.534
- Fuck you! Fuck you!
- Fuck you! Fuck you!

01:20:30.617 --> 01:20:33.495
Don't you dare do that!
Don't you dare do that!

01:20:33.579 --> 01:20:36.248
<i>Knock the crap out of 'em,
would you? Seriously!</i>

01:20:36.332 --> 01:20:38.959
<i>Get him out.
Get him out of here!</i>

01:20:43.797 --> 01:20:46.091
<i>In the good old days,
this doesn't happen,</i>

01:20:46.174 --> 01:20:49.302
<i>because they used to treat them
very, very rough.</i>

01:20:49.387 --> 01:20:51.597
<i>And when they protested once,</i>

01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:53.807
<i>you know,
they would not do it again so easily.</i>

01:20:53.891 --> 01:20:57.353
<i>I'd like to punch him
in the face, I'll tell you.</i>

01:21:02.024 --> 01:21:03.484
<i>I love the old days.</i>

01:21:03.567 --> 01:21:07.029
<i>You know what they used to do
to guys like that in a place like this?</i>

01:21:08.113 --> 01:21:10.991
<i>They'd be carried out
on a stretcher, folks.</i>

01:21:13.201 --> 01:21:14.495
<i>Yeah, it's true.</i>

01:21:14.578 --> 01:21:15.954
Knock the hell out of that mouth.

01:21:16.038 --> 01:21:18.540
The next time we see him,
we might have to kill him.

01:21:19.542 --> 01:21:21.710
<i>In the good old days,</i>

01:21:21.794 --> 01:21:24.963
<i>they'd rip him out of that seat so fast...</i>

01:21:28.509 --> 01:21:30.678
- Shut up. Shut the hell up.
- No, fuck no.

01:21:30.761 --> 01:21:32.095
<i>No, I will not shut the hell up.</i>

01:21:32.179 --> 01:21:33.472
Why are you even here?

01:21:34.139 --> 01:21:35.724
Get the fuck out of here, man.

01:21:36.100 --> 01:21:37.393
Get out of here.

01:21:39.186 --> 01:21:41.772
<i>- Be respectful!
- I care about my son's future!</i>

01:21:44.608 --> 01:21:46.109
<i>In the good old days...</i>

01:21:47.152 --> 01:21:50.989
<i>law enforcement
acted a lot quicker than this.</i>

01:21:52.700 --> 01:21:53.742
<i>A lot quicker.</i>

01:21:54.910 --> 01:21:56.620
<i>And we are going
to enforce the law,</i>

01:21:56.704 --> 01:21:59.832
<i>and Americans should remember that,
if we're going to have law and order.</i>

01:22:01.208 --> 01:22:06.922
I am...
the law and order candidate.

01:22:09.842 --> 01:22:13.762
We thought... I mean,
they called the end of slavery "jubilee."

01:22:13.846 --> 01:22:15.597
We thought we were done then.

01:22:15.806 --> 01:22:19.142
And then you had 100 years
of Jim Crow, terror and lynching.

01:22:20.352 --> 01:22:24.022
Dr. King, these guys come on the scene,
Ella Jo Baker, Fannie Lou Hamer,

01:22:24.106 --> 01:22:26.191
we get the bills passed to vote,

01:22:26.274 --> 01:22:28.026
and then they break out the handcuffs.

01:22:28.110 --> 01:22:31.363
Label you felon,
you can't vote or get a job.

01:22:31.447 --> 01:22:35.534
So, we don't know
what the next iteration of this will be,

01:22:35.617 --> 01:22:38.036
but it will be. It will be.

01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:39.788
And we will have to be vigilant.

01:23:03.646 --> 01:23:08.734
<i>The Bureau of Justice reported
That one in three young, black males</i>

01:23:08.817 --> 01:23:11.361
<i>is expected to go to jail or prison
during his lifetime,</i>

01:23:11.444 --> 01:23:14.364
<i>which is
an unbelievably shocking statistic.</i>

01:23:22.289 --> 01:23:26.251
<i>Black men account
for roughly 6.5% of the US population.</i>

01:23:26.334 --> 01:23:30.213
<i>They make up 40.2%
of the prison population.</i>

01:23:34.259 --> 01:23:37.763
We now have more African Americans
under criminal supervision

01:23:37.846 --> 01:23:39.890
than all the slaves back in the 1850s.

01:23:39.973 --> 01:23:42.810
The prison industrial complex, uh...

01:23:42.893 --> 01:23:47.480
relies historically
on the inheritances of slavery.

01:23:50.192 --> 01:23:51.860
<i>The 13th Amendment says,</i>

01:23:51.944 --> 01:23:55.739
<i>"No involuntary servitude except for those
who have been duly convicted of a crime."</i>

01:23:55.823 --> 01:23:59.702
<i>So once you've been convicted of a crime,
you are in essence a slave of the state.</i>

01:24:01.203 --> 01:24:03.831
The stroke of a pen is not self-enforcing.

01:24:03.914 --> 01:24:07.034
And so, while the 13th Amendment is hailed
as this great milestone for freedom,

01:24:07.084 --> 01:24:10.879
and abolitionists celebrate,
and this is the end of a lifelong quest,

01:24:10.963 --> 01:24:12.673
the reality is much more problematic.

01:24:12.756 --> 01:24:16.051
Well, once that clause is inserted
in there, it becomes a tool.

01:24:16.134 --> 01:24:18.220
It's there.
It's embedded in the structure.

01:24:18.303 --> 01:24:22.808
And for those who seek to use
this criminality clause as a tool,

01:24:22.891 --> 01:24:25.602
it can become a pretty powerful one,
because it's privileged.

01:24:25.686 --> 01:24:28.355
It's in the constitution,
it's the supreme law of the land.

01:24:30.899 --> 01:24:33.110
Throughout American history,

01:24:33.193 --> 01:24:35.988
African Americans
have repeatedly been controlled

01:24:36.071 --> 01:24:39.908
through systems of racial
and social control that appear to die,

01:24:39.992 --> 01:24:42.327
but then are reborn in new form,

01:24:42.410 --> 01:24:44.997
tailored to the needs and constraints
of the time.

01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:46.999
<i>You know, after the collapse of slavery,</i>

01:24:47.082 --> 01:24:50.252
<i>a new system was born,
convict leasing,</i>

01:24:50.335 --> 01:24:53.631
<i>which was a new form of slavery.</i>

01:24:54.882 --> 01:24:59.261
<i>And once convict leasing faded away,
a new system was born,</i>

01:24:59.344 --> 01:25:00.804
<i>a Jim Crow system,</i>

01:25:00.888 --> 01:25:06.268
<i>that relegated African Americans
to a permanent second-class status.</i>

01:25:07.686 --> 01:25:08.812
<i>And here we are,</i>

01:25:08.896 --> 01:25:12.399
<i>decades after the collapse
of the old Jim Crow,</i>

01:25:12.482 --> 01:25:15.694
<i>and a new system
has been born again in America.</i>

01:25:15.778 --> 01:25:19.197
A system of mass incarceration
that, once again,

01:25:19.281 --> 01:25:21.825
strips millions of poor people,

01:25:21.909 --> 01:25:24.161
overwhelmingly poor people of color,

01:25:24.244 --> 01:25:27.915
of the very rights supposedly won
in the civil rights movement.

01:25:27.998 --> 01:25:30.417
And so instead of talking about it,

01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:32.085
we just tried to move on.

01:25:32.169 --> 01:25:34.963
After the Civil Rights Act was passed
and after the civil rights laws,

01:25:35.047 --> 01:25:36.423
we tried to play it off.

01:25:36.506 --> 01:25:37.746
Because we didn't deal with it,

01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:40.385
that narrative
of racial difference continued.

01:25:40.468 --> 01:25:44.181
And it turned into this presumption
of dangerousness and guilt

01:25:44.264 --> 01:25:47.267
that follows every black and brown person
wherever they are.

01:25:51.063 --> 01:25:53.899
<i>You need to get out
of the street immediately.</i>

01:25:53.982 --> 01:25:55.358
Get out of the way!

01:25:58.195 --> 01:25:59.988
This is St. Louis County Police.

01:26:00.072 --> 01:26:01.448
Stay off the roadway.

01:26:01.949 --> 01:26:05.243
<i>Ferguson was not simply
about Mike Brown.</i>

01:26:05.327 --> 01:26:11.166
It was also this pattern of mass
criminalization and mass incarceration.

01:26:12.167 --> 01:26:14.544
Back off. Back off.

01:26:15.170 --> 01:26:18.674
There was an average of three warrants
per household in Ferguson.

01:26:19.800 --> 01:26:22.678
<i>And so people rose up
because they understood</i>

01:26:22.761 --> 01:26:27.515
<i>that they were also enemies of the state,
seen as enemies of the state.</i>

01:26:29.517 --> 01:26:34.272
<i>The communities in which black people live
really become occupied territories,</i>

01:26:34.356 --> 01:26:40.112
and black people have become seen
as, um, enemy combatants, right,

01:26:40.195 --> 01:26:42.072
who don't have any rights,

01:26:42.155 --> 01:26:45.658
and who can be stopped and frisked

01:26:45.743 --> 01:26:48.996
and, you know, arrested
and detained and questioned

01:26:49.079 --> 01:26:50.706
and killed with impunity.

01:26:57.004 --> 01:26:59.089
<i>If we were to look at</i>

01:26:59.172 --> 01:27:03.676
the larger-scale riots that we know of
in, you know, our recent history,

01:27:03.761 --> 01:27:05.303
<i>from Rodney King,</i>

01:27:05.387 --> 01:27:07.765
<i>to the Detroit riot in 1967,</i>

01:27:07.848 --> 01:27:09.766
<i>the Newark riot in 1967,</i>

01:27:09.850 --> 01:27:13.437
<i>Harlem riot in 1964,
Watts in 1965.</i>

01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:16.940
Every single one of those riots
was a result of police brutality.

01:27:17.024 --> 01:27:18.064
That is the common thread.

01:27:18.108 --> 01:27:21.737
- Fight back! Fight back!
- Fist up! Fist up!

01:27:21.820 --> 01:27:25.907
<i>It would be a mistake to say,
as many do in the current context,</i>

01:27:25.991 --> 01:27:28.827
<i>that if you're against the police,
then you're against law and order.</i>

01:27:28.910 --> 01:27:32.247
<i>These are hardworking civil servants
putting their lives on the line every day.</i>

01:27:32.330 --> 01:27:33.331
<i>And that's true.</i>

01:27:33.415 --> 01:27:37.669
<i>People who join the police do so,
you know, to do these sorts of things.</i>

01:27:38.670 --> 01:27:44.092
But if you dismiss black complaints
of mistreatment by police

01:27:44.176 --> 01:27:46.344
as being completely rooted
in our modern context,

01:27:46.428 --> 01:27:48.068
then you're missing the point completely.

01:27:48.138 --> 01:27:50.348
There has never been
a period in our history

01:27:50.432 --> 01:27:56.229
where the law and order branch
of the state has not operated against

01:27:56.313 --> 01:27:59.817
the freedoms, the liberties,
the options, the choices

01:27:59.900 --> 01:28:02.903
that have been available for
the black community, generally speaking.

01:28:02.986 --> 01:28:07.825
And to ignore that racial heritage,
to ignore that historical context,

01:28:07.908 --> 01:28:09.868
means that you can't have
an informed debate

01:28:09.952 --> 01:28:13.288
about the current state
of blacks and police relationship today,

01:28:13.371 --> 01:28:15.248
'cause this didn't just appear
out of nothing.

01:28:15.332 --> 01:28:18.376
This is the product
of a centuries-long historical process.

01:28:18.460 --> 01:28:22.047
And to not reckon with that
is to shut off solutions.

01:28:22.130 --> 01:28:25.675
We may have lost the sheets
of the Ku Klux Klan,

01:28:25.758 --> 01:28:28.887
but, clearly, when you see
black kids being shot down...

01:28:29.471 --> 01:28:32.808
then, obviously,
we didn't cut out this cancer.

01:28:34.852 --> 01:28:36.228
For many of us, you know,

01:28:36.311 --> 01:28:39.147
whose families
lived through this,

01:28:39.231 --> 01:28:41.691
who are extensions
of this kind of oppression,

01:28:41.774 --> 01:28:44.652
we don't need to see pictures
to understand what's going on.

01:28:44.736 --> 01:28:47.865
It's really to kind of, like,
speak to the masses

01:28:47.948 --> 01:28:50.325
who have been ignoring this
for the majority of their life.

01:28:50.408 --> 01:28:53.411
But I also think there's trouble
of just showing,

01:28:53.495 --> 01:28:56.414
you know,
black bodies as dead bodies, too.

01:28:56.498 --> 01:28:59.751
Too much of anything
becomes unhealthy, unuseful.

01:29:00.961 --> 01:29:05.298
I think they need to be seen,
if the family is okay with it.

01:29:05.841 --> 01:29:09.761
It wasn't until things were made visual
in the civil rights movement,

01:29:09.845 --> 01:29:12.555
that we really saw, uh,

01:29:12.639 --> 01:29:16.518
folks come out
and being shocked into movement.

01:29:16.601 --> 01:29:19.646
You have to shock people
into paying attention.

01:29:19.729 --> 01:29:23.566
But there's a kind of historical
trajectory that we can trace here, um,

01:29:23.650 --> 01:29:25.818
through media and technology.

01:29:25.903 --> 01:29:29.156
We went back to, um, the slavery era,

01:29:29.239 --> 01:29:32.450
when people were writing autobiographies
or slave narratives.

01:29:34.202 --> 01:29:35.828
<i>Later in the 19th century,</i>

01:29:35.913 --> 01:29:37.455
when people began to use photographs

01:29:37.539 --> 01:29:39.374
<i>and they showed images.</i>

01:29:40.500 --> 01:29:43.420
<i>There's a famous image
of slave Gordon and his back,</i>

01:29:43.503 --> 01:29:46.839
<i>and you can see just this
kind of lattice of scar tissue</i>

01:29:46.924 --> 01:29:50.552
<i>that is evidence of the whippings
that he received.</i>

01:29:50.635 --> 01:29:54.681
<i>Or the images of lynchings,
which white people produced.</i>

01:29:56.599 --> 01:29:59.477
<i>The murder of Emmett Till
was really thought of as being</i>

01:29:59.561 --> 01:30:02.898
<i>one of the primary catalysts
for the civil rights movement.</i>

01:30:04.024 --> 01:30:06.109
<i>The willingness of his mother</i>

01:30:06.193 --> 01:30:09.612
<i>to have an open-casket funeral.</i>

01:30:12.365 --> 01:30:15.994
<i>Hundreds and hundreds
of black folks filed past</i>

01:30:16.078 --> 01:30:18.205
<i>and see this young boy</i>

01:30:18.288 --> 01:30:21.458
<i>who had been killed
by white supremacists in the South.</i>

01:30:23.376 --> 01:30:26.964
<i>To publish those photographs
in black publications</i>

01:30:27.047 --> 01:30:31.801
<i>so the entire black world, like
our Facebook or our Twitter now, right?</i>

01:30:31.884 --> 01:30:35.722
<i>So that the whole black world
could see what had happened.</i>

01:30:35.805 --> 01:30:39.934
In the 1950s, Dr. King
and the civil rights movement

01:30:40.018 --> 01:30:41.269
used television in this way.

01:30:41.353 --> 01:30:43.480
<i>"Look, this is what segregation
looks like.</i>

01:30:43.563 --> 01:30:47.484
<i>These are dogs attacking children.
These are people being fire hosed."</i>

01:30:49.402 --> 01:30:54.241
<i>Searching for the medium of technology,
that will confirm your experience</i>

01:30:54.324 --> 01:30:57.119
such that your basic humanity
can be recognized.

01:30:57.202 --> 01:31:00.330
The difference now is
somebody can hold up one of these,

01:31:00.413 --> 01:31:01.748
get what's going on.

01:31:01.831 --> 01:31:06.336
They can put it on YouTube,
and the whole world has to deal with it.

01:31:06.419 --> 01:31:07.629
That's what's new.

01:31:07.712 --> 01:31:10.007
It's not the protest.
It's not the brutality.

01:31:10.090 --> 01:31:12.509
It's the fact that we can force
a conversation about it.

01:31:12.592 --> 01:31:16.596
We have been consistently been murdered
as a result of police aggression.

01:31:16.679 --> 01:31:20.600
They generally would excuse it
by calling us criminals.

01:31:21.268 --> 01:31:23.270
<i>When they was killing Oscar Grant...</i>

01:31:30.443 --> 01:31:32.279
When they got to Eric Garner...

01:31:32.862 --> 01:31:34.531
I can't breathe.

01:31:34.614 --> 01:31:35.865
I can't breathe.

01:31:35.948 --> 01:31:38.618
I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.

01:31:38.701 --> 01:31:40.078
I can't breathe.

01:31:40.162 --> 01:31:42.539
I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.

01:31:42.622 --> 01:31:44.582
<i>Everyone pointed out
that he was saying,</i>

01:31:44.666 --> 01:31:46.418
<i>"I can't breathe.
I can't breathe."</i>

01:31:46.501 --> 01:31:48.211
But the sentences before that were,

01:31:48.295 --> 01:31:50.505
"Why are you always stopping me?

01:31:50.588 --> 01:31:55.468
Why is it, day in and day out,
week in and week out, you're stopping me?"

01:31:55.552 --> 01:31:58.930
And that, I think, is hugely important.

01:31:59.013 --> 01:32:02.975
When we think about the children
who were killed at the hands of the state,

01:32:03.060 --> 01:32:06.313
I think about Tamir Rice at 12 years old,

01:32:06.396 --> 01:32:09.941
<i>and the way that he was killed,
you know, it hits my heart.</i>

01:32:10.900 --> 01:32:14.154
Go ahead and take
your seat belt off. Stop. Stop!

01:32:22.995 --> 01:32:24.164
You good?

01:32:30.128 --> 01:32:32.672
- Roll on your stomach. Now!
- Stop fighting!

01:32:35.217 --> 01:32:38.345
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Oh, shit.

01:32:38.428 --> 01:32:41.306
He shot me, man. I was shot.

01:32:41.389 --> 01:32:43.016
He didn't do shit.
You didn't.

01:32:43.099 --> 01:32:45.685
- I'm losing breath.
- Fuck your breath.

01:32:45.768 --> 01:32:47.437
Stay with me.

01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:50.773
We got pulled over
for a busted taillight in the back.

01:33:17.342 --> 01:33:18.968
<i>Police violence,</i>

01:33:19.051 --> 01:33:21.888
<i>that isn't the problem
in and of itself.</i>

01:33:21.971 --> 01:33:26.017
It's reflection of a much larger,
brutal system

01:33:26.100 --> 01:33:29.604
of racial and social control
known as mass incarceration,

01:33:29.687 --> 01:33:33.608
which authorizes
this kind of police violence.

01:33:33.691 --> 01:33:36.653
That's why, for me,
the brilliance of Black Lives Matter...

01:33:36.736 --> 01:33:41.574
They have a distributed leadership model.
You can't find their address.

01:33:41.658 --> 01:33:44.661
I mean, Black Lives Matter
is not a stoppable phenomenon,

01:33:44.744 --> 01:33:46.454
by a bullet or anything else.

01:33:46.538 --> 01:33:48.415
And so, there's hope there
because of that.

01:33:49.081 --> 01:33:51.543
Having people truly understand

01:33:51.626 --> 01:33:54.379
that when black lives matter,

01:33:55.046 --> 01:33:57.006
everybody's life matters,

01:33:57.089 --> 01:34:02.011
including every single person
that enters this criminal justice system

01:34:02.094 --> 01:34:04.096
and this prison industrial complex.

01:34:04.181 --> 01:34:07.058
It's not just even about
only black lives, right?

01:34:07.141 --> 01:34:11.646
<i>It's about changing the way
this country understands human dignity.</i>

01:34:24.951 --> 01:34:28.580
<i>That's what, really,
this Black Lives Matter moment is about.</i>

01:34:28.663 --> 01:34:33.125
<i>This question of whose life
do we recognize as valuable?</i>

01:34:45.513 --> 01:34:48.558
<i>The opposite of criminalization
is humanization.</i>

01:34:48.641 --> 01:34:51.477
<i>That's the one thing I hope
that people will understand.</i>

01:34:53.020 --> 01:34:56.608
It's about rehumanizing us,
as a people,

01:34:56.691 --> 01:34:59.652
and us, right, as a people,
all of us.

01:35:08.245 --> 01:35:11.414
The system of mass incarceration
has grown,

01:35:11.498 --> 01:35:14.417
and sprawled and developed an appetite

01:35:14.501 --> 01:35:19.088
that is gobbling up people
in communities of all colors.

01:35:19.171 --> 01:35:20.757
But if it hadn't been for the fact

01:35:20.840 --> 01:35:25.553
that it began with a group of people
defined by race,

01:35:25.637 --> 01:35:28.848
that we as a nation
have learned not to care about,

01:35:28.931 --> 01:35:33.603
we wouldn't be talking about
two million people behind bars today.

01:35:33.686 --> 01:35:34.729
People say all the time,

01:35:34.812 --> 01:35:37.148
"I don't understand how people
could've tolerated slavery."

01:35:37.231 --> 01:35:39.359
How could they have made peace with that?

01:35:39.442 --> 01:35:43.280
How could people have gone to a lynching
and participated in that?

01:35:43.363 --> 01:35:47.074
How did people make sense
of the segregation,

01:35:47.158 --> 01:35:50.286
this white and colored-only drinking...
That's so crazy.

01:35:50.370 --> 01:35:54.374
"If I was living at that time, I would
have never tolerated anything like that."

01:35:54.457 --> 01:35:57.752
And the truth is, we are living
at this time, and we are tolerating it.
