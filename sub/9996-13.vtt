00:16.850 --> 00:19.690
Well,well, look who finally
decided to wake up.

00:20.190 --> 00:24.210
Joe... Where are we? Whats this place?

00:24.220 --> 00:26.060
What do you mean,at iis place?

00:26.080 --> 00:28.550
This is our bedroom.
You're in our bed.

00:28.560 --> 00:31.440
Con,hurry up,'cause I got
to meet Terry at 10:00.

00:31.840 --> 00:33.630
Are you wearing tennis whites?

00:33.650 --> 00:36.980
Yes,I'm wearing tennis whites.
The are the rules at the club.

00:36.990 --> 00:40.330
Come on. Come on. Girls got their
riding lessons in 45 minutes.

00:44.580 --> 00:46.970
Joe,I don't know what's going on here.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.120
But this is not our house.

00:48.150 --> 00:51.650
What are you talng about? This is
our house. Of course it's our house.

00:51.660 --> 00:54.360
I'll show you the deed
if you don't believe me.

01:05.519 --> 01:09.330
Damn. I know how to live.

01:10.400 --> 01:12.920
Dad,I think the heater
in the pool's broken.

01:14.020 --> 01:15.320
We have a pool?

01:15.360 --> 01:17.340
Of course we have a pool.

01:17.370 --> 01:20.030
How else would we swimming every day?

01:21.990 --> 01:23.480
Are you okay Mom?

01:23.510 --> 01:25.740
Yeah, I-I guess so.

01:26.540 --> 01:29.820
Actually,I think I'm... I'm great.

01:30.400 --> 01:32.420
This place is amazing.

01:32.460 --> 01:35.010
It's everything we ever wanted.

01:36.480 --> 01:40.290
What's back there? well,let me guess.
It's maid's quarters?

01:40.300 --> 01:42.400
Hey,Allison. Allison,hey,hey,hey!
What are you doing?

01:42.410 --> 01:44.950
What do you mean?
I'm checking out my house.

01:44.960 --> 01:49.280
Okay,that's fine. But we don't
go in that room. You ow that.

01:49.830 --> 01:53.130
Oh,come on,everybody.
Lighten up. It's just a room.

01:53.140 --> 01:55.580
Mom,we're not allowed to go in there.

01:55.600 --> 01:57.490
Not ever. That's the deal,remember?

01:57.500 --> 01:58.940
Deal? What deal?

01:58.950 --> 02:01.390
This is our house,isn't it?
This is our room.

02:01.400 --> 02:03.410
- Allison!
- Mom!

"Roof is to house as summit is to..."

03:02.030 --> 03:04.100
- Mountain?
- Good.

03:04.110 --> 03:07.750
"Composer is to melody as autr is to..."

03:07.760 --> 03:09.690
- Uh,book.
- Excellent.

03:09.700 --> 03:12.310
That is the dumbest
question I have ever heard.

03:12.340 --> 03:14.630
What's that supposed to teach you?

03:14.640 --> 03:17.420
"If you're looking for a melody,
don't look in a book?"

03:17.440 --> 03:18.680
I don't t it.

03:18.700 --> 03:19.910
It's an analogy.

03:19.940 --> 03:21.360
It's not supposed
to teach you anything.

03:21.410 --> 03:23.190
It tests your understanding of language.

03:23.220 --> 03:25.420
And Daddy's helping me
get ready for the PSATs.

03:25.440 --> 03:27.380
- What's that?
- It's a test.

03:27.390 --> 03:30.380
Okay,and if I do well enough,that
means I might get into a good college,

03:30.410 --> 03:32.240
which means I can move far away
and never see you again.

03:32.270 --> 03:35.500
So,please,
leave me alone so I can practice.

03:37.460 --> 03:39.650
Any chance you could take
the girls in today?

03:39.680 --> 03:42.330
Lee just called me. He wants me
to meet him at Fountain Hills.

03:42.340 --> 03:44.150
Yeah.

03:49.840 --> 03:50.940
Hello?

03:50.970 --> 03:52.920
May I speak with Allison Dubois?

03:52.940 --> 03:54.060
Well,may I ask who's calling?

03:54.080 --> 03:55.350
My name is Caitlyn Lynch.

03:55.360 --> 03:57.320
I'm with the Lydecker Corporation.

03:57.340 --> 03:59.980
I know this is going
to sound kind of out of the blue,

04:00.000 --> 04:03.130
but I've been tracking
your career for some time now.

04:03.160 --> 04:06.240
I was wondering if it might be
possible to set up a meeting withou

04:06.250 --> 04:08.600
to discuss a potential
business opportunity.

04:08.610 --> 04:10.830
Uh,what kind of "business opportunity"?

04:10.850 --> 04:13.390
Well,I'd rely prer to discuss
that with you person.

04:13.410 --> 04:16.230
I actually have an opening
in my schedule at 1:00 today.

04:16.250 --> 04:18.790
Is there any possibility
we could meet for lunch?

04:18.829 --> 04:21.769
Lunch today?
I don't think so. I'm working.

04:21.779 --> 04:23.420
Well,I'm happy to come to you.

04:23.440 --> 04:26.090
I was thinking
we could meet at Firmament.

04:26.580 --> 04:28.640
Firmament?
Well,that's very nice of you,

04:28.650 --> 04:31.320
but don't think I can meet you
for lunch today at Firmament.

04:31.360 --> 04:33.710
Is there a day that might be better?

04:36.400 --> 04:38.050
I don't think so.

04:38.060 --> 04:42.320
You know,I really have to get going,uh,
Caitlyn,but thank you for thinking of me.

04:43.100 --> 04:46.130
You just turned down lunch at Firmament?

04:46.150 --> 04:48.580
That's the hottest place in town.

04:48.590 --> 04:50.160
Who wanted to take you there?

04:50.190 --> 04:53.060
I don't know. Some woman
from the Lydecker Corporation.

04:53.790 --> 04:56.840
She wanted to talk to me
about a "business opportunity."

04:56.870 --> 04:58.840
The Lydecker Corporation?

04:58.870 --> 05:01.200
Don't they make everything?

05:01.720 --> 05:03.830
Maybe you should hear
what she has to say.

05:03.850 --> 05:05.000
No,I don't think so.

05:05.030 --> 05:06.910
She probably read about me
in the papers last year,

05:06.930 --> 05:10.570
wants to hire me for
some kind of "private reading."

05:10.860 --> 05:13.680
You know I'm not really
interested in that kind of thing.

05:14.460 --> 05:19.340
I don't know,for a lunch at Firmament,
maybe you could feign a little interest.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.240
Her name's Autumn Colville.

05:21.260 --> 05:22.810
She's a paralegal who works downtown.

05:22.860 --> 05:25.270
Her mother reported
her missing yesterday.

05:25.290 --> 05:27.480
Autumn's car is still
parked in her parking spot.

05:27.520 --> 05:31.050
Her parents found groceries,still in
their bags,melting on her kitchen counter,

05:31.080 --> 05:35.070
so I think it's highly likely
she was abducted from her apartment.

05:36.070 --> 05:39.060
Autumn's mom said we're welcome
to do another walk-through.

05:39.100 --> 05:41.220
Tell me if you can see anything.

05:42.100 --> 05:45.850
Sure,of course. I just hope
I can be of some kind of help.

05:52.600 --> 05:53.990
Oh,my God...

05:54.010 --> 05:55.920
What's the matter?

05:56.730 --> 06:00.140
Oh,the blood. And that corpse.

06:00.150 --> 06:02.260
What corpse?

06:08.330 --> 06:10.750
She was right there.

06:10.760 --> 06:12.830
Autumn Colville.

06:12.840 --> 06:15.780
She was lying right there,dead.

06:16.290 --> 06:19.720
Oh,her eyes...
Someone had taken her eyes.

06:20.050 --> 06:21.300
We've been through
this lace a few times;

06:21.320 --> 06:24.540
there's been no idence to suggest
that kind of violence occurred here.

06:24.550 --> 06:27.480
I mean,look at this place.

06:27.510 --> 06:29.180
Well,I saw it.

06:29.220 --> 06:33.000
Who's to say that the killer
didn't clean up after himself?

06:33.520 --> 06:36.850
Well,I guess we'll get the crime scene
boys to come back,take another look.

06:37.360 --> 06:39.490
Thank you.

06:40.640 --> 06:43.060
T-minus 13 days and counting.
You ready?

06:43.070 --> 06:44.870
I don't know.
I've been taking practice tests,

06:44.871 --> 06:47.171
but I have to find a way
to go my verbal aptitude.

06:47.350 --> 06:50.700
I'm thinking about asking permission
to come to school on Saturday.

06:50.730 --> 06:54.150
Sit in an empty classroom and
just take a simulated test.

06:54.180 --> 06:56.340
So I know what it's gonna feel like
on the d of the real one, you know?

06:56.350 --> 06:58.890
- Seriously?
- Yeah,why not?

06:58.900 --> 07:00.960
Ariel! Ashley!

07:02.860 --> 07:04.250
Did you guys hear the news?

07:04.280 --> 07:06.340
What news? What's going on?

07:08.440 --> 07:10.150
Do you remember Stacey Anne Burrows?

07:10.180 --> 07:13.310
Yeah,she transferred to Holy
Child after junior high. Why?

07:13.950 --> 07:16.320
- She died yesterday.
- What?

07:16.620 --> 07:18.820
Her parents got her
a car for her 16th birthday.

07:18.840 --> 07:21.060
And she rolled it yesterday
on her way home from school.

07:21.070 --> 07:23.380
Landed upside-down in a ravine.

07:23.390 --> 07:25.710
You know what the creepiest part is?

07:25.730 --> 07:27.880
The crash didn't kill her.

07:27.890 --> 07:30.840
Her car filled up with
water and she drowned.

07:41.520 --> 07:43.390
Allison Dubois?

07:46.630 --> 07:48.840
- Do I know you?
- No.

07:49.070 --> 07:50.880
But I know all about you.

07:50.890 --> 07:53.650
I'm Caitlyn Lynch.
We spoke this morning.

07:54.300 --> 07:55.530
Right. Hi.

07:56.340 --> 07:58.000
Sorry to ambush you like this,

07:58.001 --> 08:01.701
but I don't know if I was able to get
my point across to you on the phone.

08:01.710 --> 08:04.080
No,I think you were perfectly clear.

08:04.110 --> 08:06.880
but frankly,private readings,
things like that I...

08:06.881 --> 08:07.581
Hey wait a second.

08:07.590 --> 08:10.430
Is that... Is that what you
thought I was calling about?

08:10.440 --> 08:11.990
A private reading?

08:12.020 --> 08:15.640
Let me,let me explain
who I am,what I do.

08:15.980 --> 08:20.450
I'm what people refer
to as a "corporatentuitionist."

08:20.470 --> 08:23.440
That a job title you've heard before?

08:23.480 --> 08:26.150
Like you,I sense things.

08:26.190 --> 08:28.510
See things,for a living.

08:28.540 --> 08:30.630
But while you use your gifts
in the public sector,

08:30.650 --> 08:34.250
I'm under contract to
a multinational corporation.

08:34.270 --> 08:36.320
- Wait a second. You're a...
- Psychic?

08:36.600 --> 08:42.280
Well,my official title is Executive
Vice President of Corporate Strategy.

08:42.330 --> 08:46.210
But,yes,I've developed
a reputation for being...

08:46.240 --> 08:49.470
sensitive to business trends.

08:49.500 --> 08:53.530
The success or failure
of products in development.

08:53.540 --> 08:55.660
Shifts in public appetites.

08:55.700 --> 08:59.010
It's brought me a lot of money.

08:59.240 --> 09:02.480
The man I work for,Mr. Lydecker,

09:02.520 --> 09:07.990
is a great believer in unconventional
thinking when it comes to business.

09:08.020 --> 09:11.370
He's a leader,not a follower.

09:11.380 --> 09:13.570
And he and I were wondering

09:13.571 --> 09:17.371
if we could possibly entice you
into coming and working with us.

09:18.310 --> 09:20.550
You offering me a job?

09:21.590 --> 09:24.640
Well,that's...that's very flattering,

09:24.650 --> 09:28.070
but I genuinely like what
I'm doing now,what I'm doing here.

09:28.300 --> 09:32.390
And besides,I-I don't know anything
about pducts or trends or appetites.

09:32.440 --> 09:36.490
Believe me,I didn't start out
dreaming about market shortfalls,

09:36.530 --> 09:41.350
or,or impulse buys based
on psychographic data.

09:41.390 --> 09:45.190
But I do now. And you will,too.

09:46.640 --> 09:48.720
Think about it.

09:51.180 --> 09:54.970
Obviously,we're talking about
a high six-figure salary.

09:57.130 --> 09:59.470
Discuss it with your husband.

09:59.480 --> 10:02.620
If ye intrigued,givee a call.

10:09.610 --> 10:10.910
What did you say?

10:10.950 --> 10:13.440
I didn't say anything.
I didn't really get a chance.

10:14.070 --> 10:16.880
She told me to call her
if I was interested.

10:16.910 --> 10:19.820
Well,you are interested,aren't you?

10:19.830 --> 10:23.490
I don't know. I don't know.

10:24.420 --> 10:26.470
I guess I'm intrigued.

10:26.500 --> 10:29.020
That's the word
she kept using-- intrigued.

10:29.050 --> 10:32.820
What exactly does it mean
when they say higsix figures?

10:33.220 --> 10:34.810
It means you need toall her tomorrow.

10:34.850 --> 10:36.640
You need to find out
what this is all about.

10:36.670 --> 10:40.760
I didn't even know people like me
worked for big corporations.

10:40.770 --> 10:42.900
This woman Caitlyn
said she spots trends.

10:42.930 --> 10:44.410
I don't know anything about trends.

10:44.440 --> 10:46.110
Come on. Don't do that.

10:46.780 --> 10:48.290
Don't do what?
What am I doing?

10:48.300 --> 10:51.990
You're just doing this "shucks thing".
Don't do that shucks thing.

10:52.630 --> 10:54.390
Look,I'd just like
to see you acknowledge

10:54.391 --> 10:55.991
the fact that you're
very good at what you do.

10:56.030 --> 10:58.380
and an enormous corporation
has taken notice of that

10:58.381 --> 11:01.481
and according to this Caitlyn woman,
they're willing to pay you

11:01.500 --> 11:04.630
hundreds of thousands of dollars
a year to do it for them.

11:05.150 --> 11:07.720
I think you need to take this seriously.

11:07.750 --> 11:09.260
I think you need to calthis woman.

11:09.290 --> 11:11.790
If you don't like what
you hear,then fine.

11:11.800 --> 11:15.740
But you owe it to yourself,to the kids,
to me to at least give it a listen.

11:55.070 --> 11:56.950
Sir,I'm sorry to bother you.

11:56.990 --> 11:59.550
Oh,hey,you must have read my mind.

12:00.380 --> 12:02.550
Really,what did it say?

12:03.930 --> 12:06.300
I'm sorry. You came to see me.

12:07.130 --> 12:10.780
Yes,um,I need to take a little
personal time this afternoon.

12:10.810 --> 12:12.260
I know it's short notice,but...

12:12.270 --> 12:13.590
Nah,that's all right.

12:13.610 --> 12:15.400
I have to be in court
most of the day anyway.

12:15.430 --> 12:17.740
Truth is,I probably wouldn't
have even noticed you were gone

12:17.760 --> 12:20.190
if you hadn't told me,
so thanks for the heads-up.

12:20.230 --> 12:22.950
Yo uh,you want to walk with me?

12:24.500 --> 12:26.180
So after you called me last night,

12:26.181 --> 12:28.781
I had the team go and dredge
beneath thrthur Bridge.

12:29.200 --> 12:32.170
Scanlon just called. They found
the remains of Autumn Colville.

12:32.180 --> 12:33.760
In three separate duffle bags.

12:33.780 --> 12:35.980
- Oh,my God.
- That's not all.

12:35.990 --> 12:37.640
There were several more
duffel bags down there.

12:37.660 --> 12:41.360
When they opened them up,they found the
butchered body parts of two more girls.

12:41.390 --> 12:43.360
And their eyes were missing as well.

12:43.370 --> 12:46.490
Looks like we got
ourselves a serial killer.

12:47.560 --> 12:50.350
Do whatever it is you need to do.
I'll find you if I need you.

12:50.910 --> 12:52.620
And stop looking so guil.

12:52.630 --> 12:55.630
Everybody takea little
personal time now and then.

13:15.480 --> 13:19.340
My name's Allison Dubois.
I'm here to see Caitlyn Lynch.

13:37.540 --> 13:40.790
<i>Thinking globally.
Ating globally.</i>

13:40.800 --> 13:42.540
Allison?

13:42.580 --> 13:45.780
I'm so pleased you decided to come by.

13:45.790 --> 13:48.180
Maybe I could work in the lobby.

13:49.080 --> 13:52.600
Well,if you're up for it,I thought
maybe you could sit in on my 2:00.

13:52.620 --> 13:55.350
Get a feel for the kind of work
you'll be doing here

13:55.351 --> 13:57.251
if you decide
to take us up on our offer.

13:57.260 --> 13:58.590
That would be great.

13:58.610 --> 14:01.780
Terrific. And don't look so nervous.

14:01.790 --> 14:06.080
Like your boss said,everybody takes
a little persal time now and then.

14:35.260 --> 14:37.270
Oh,my God.

14:37.660 --> 14:41.650
Stacey Anne? Is that you?

14:56.220 --> 14:59.050
Whereverou are,with live video
chatting on the L-Phone,

14:59.051 --> 15:00.751
you never have to miss a meeting.

15:00.770 --> 15:02.940
Whether your traveling,
working from home,

15:02.980 --> 15:06.190
or just somewhere else,
the L-Phone makes your presence felt.

15:06.220 --> 15:11.610
The all-new L-Phone from Lydecker: Changing
the way we communicate one face at a time.

15:12.900 --> 15:16.240
I'm sorry. I don't think it works.

15:17.120 --> 15:21.990
Everything is aimed squarely at
upwardly mobile people on the go.

15:22.000 --> 15:26.080
Overachievers with
a lot of disposable income.

15:26.090 --> 15:29.460
But that's not who's
going to buy ts phone.

15:30.300 --> 15:33.430
Well,Caitlyn,it's a $900 cell phone.

15:33.460 --> 15:39.320
Now granted,it's a $900 cell phone
with video chat,but still,a $900 phone.

15:39.960 --> 15:41.600
Who do you suggest we sell it to?

15:41.630 --> 15:44.610
Or more importantly,who do
you think is going to buy it?

15:44.650 --> 15:46.610
Kids.

15:46.630 --> 15:48.550
I know what you're thinking.

15:48.620 --> 15:51.420
Video chatting is all the ra right now.

15:51.450 --> 15:54.590
Nobody even buys a computer
unless it's vid chat-capable.

15:54.610 --> 15:56.060
But here's the thing.

15:56.110 --> 16:00.190
Grownups are going to realize that they
don't want to be seen by other grownups

16:00.230 --> 16:03.440
unless it's absolutely necessary.

16:03.900 --> 16:06.870
They're not going to want
to have to put on clothes,

16:06.900 --> 16:10.950
check their makeup put out the cigarette
they're not even supposed to be smoking

16:10.960 --> 16:13.840
just for a simple phone nversation.

16:14.490 --> 16:19.100
Teenagers,on the other hand,
love to be seen.

16:19.110 --> 16:24.200
They erect virtualonuments to
themselves onocial networking sites.

16:24.530 --> 16:28.710
This phone is for them-- not us.

16:29.380 --> 16:31.870
You're sure about that?

16:31.880 --> 16:34.850
Of course I'm sure,Ted.

16:34.860 --> 16:37.060
I dreamt it.

16:48.200 --> 16:49.680
So...

16:49.720 --> 16:52.500
So,it's very impresve.

16:52.540 --> 16:54.170
You're very impressive.

16:54.200 --> 16:59.390
This office,the salary,
all of it,but that meeting...

16:59.680 --> 17:01.220
I don't know if I could do that.

17:01.270 --> 17:04.030
I do. I'm certain of it.

17:04.420 --> 17:08.250
Besides,those meetings are
a relatively small part of the job.

17:08.280 --> 17:13.170
Most of my work is done right here,
in this chair,actually.

17:14.089 --> 17:16.319
- What do you mean?
- Please.

17:18.050 --> 17:22.589
Twice a day I take two hours
of contemplation time.

17:22.599 --> 17:26.160
Which is a fancy way of saying
that I lay in that chair,

17:26.180 --> 17:30.230
shut my eyes and dream
about the future of Lydecker.

17:30.240 --> 17:32.780
I'm having one made just for you.

17:32.790 --> 17:33.920
Why?

17:33.950 --> 17:36.270
What kind of question is that?

17:36.290 --> 17:38.790
No,I appreciate your confidence.
I do.

17:38.800 --> 17:40.610
I just don't understand
why this company

17:40.611 --> 17:43.311
would want to invest in me
when they already have you.

17:43.350 --> 17:49.110
Lydecker is a multi-national conglomerate
with branches all over the world.

17:49.120 --> 17:54.190
I'm good,Allison,better than good,
but I'm still just one woman.

17:54.200 --> 17:57.150
Even I can't keep track of everything.

17:58.960 --> 18:00.880
That's a lot to think about.

18:00.910 --> 18:03.080
I don't know what to say.

18:03.110 --> 18:06.400
How about "Yes,"
and you'll start on Monday.

18:06.450 --> 18:08.110
Monday?

18:08.160 --> 18:10.330
I don't think I could do that.

18:10.360 --> 18:12.800
I've worked for the District
Attorney's office for years.

18:12.840 --> 18:15.180
I feel like I'd need
to give them some notice.

18:15.210 --> 18:18.480
Allison,I respect your loyalty,

18:18.490 --> 18:23.570
but Lydecker has just made you an offer
th will completely change your life.

18:24.020 --> 18:29.180
I think it's safe to say that the company
has taken a big step in your direction.

18:29.190 --> 18:33.500
If you want this job,you're going
to have to take a step towards us.

18:34.820 --> 18:36.260
Sorry to interrupt,Ms. Lynch.

18:36.270 --> 18:38.940
Mr. Lydecker is on the phone from Tokyo.

18:38.960 --> 18:40.170
Thanks,Donald.

18:40.190 --> 18:42.480
I'm sorry. I've got to take this.

18:42.730 --> 18:45.200
Allison,it's a lot to digest.

18:45.210 --> 18:47.970
Why don't you take until
the end of the week.

18:48.010 --> 18:51.310
But by Friday,
I'm going to need your answer.

18:51.860 --> 18:53.900
Yes?

18:56.970 --> 19:02.110
According to my calculations,this time
next week you will be making one dollar

19:02.120 --> 19:05.220
for every star that I see.

19:06.500 --> 19:08.270
No,wait a second. Scratch that.

19:08.280 --> 19:10.980
Make that two dollars.

19:10.990 --> 19:12.510
Well,I haven't said yes yet.

19:12.540 --> 19:16.520
I mean,that woman Caitlyn saidhat the
hours are gonna be long,unpredicble,

19:16.560 --> 19:21.170
that I won't be able to be home as much,
pick the girls up from school anymore.

19:21.180 --> 19:23.420
We can make th work.

19:23.430 --> 19:24.790
How?

19:24.810 --> 19:27.760
Ariel's gonna be 16 in like a minute.

19:27.790 --> 19:28.980
You think if we got her a car,

19:28.981 --> 19:32.181
she wouldn't be willing to play
chauffeur for her sisters?

19:32.190 --> 19:34.590
Well,I don't know if
I wanto do that to her.

19:34.620 --> 19:36.820
And what about Mr. Devalos?

19:36.850 --> 19:38.500
He's probably an excellent driver,

19:38.501 --> 19:41.201
but I doubt he'd be interested
in driving the girls.

19:41.210 --> 19:43.200
He's been so good to me.

19:43.250 --> 19:44.720
Because he likes you.

19:44.740 --> 19:47.350
And he's gonna want this for you.

19:47.360 --> 19:49.810
He's your friend,right?

19:50.100 --> 19:52.200
So ask him,get his advice.

19:52.240 --> 19:55.190
If you're honestly worried about how
this decision is gonna affect him,

19:55.200 --> 19:57.360
I say make him a part of it.

20:23.420 --> 20:27.950
Time. Time's up. Time to trade
and grade our practice tests.

20:28.380 --> 20:31.130
But I didn't answer
the last five questions.

20:31.150 --> 20:32.880
You're kidding me.

20:33.860 --> 20:37.210
You always answer all the
questions,even if you have to guess.

20:40.060 --> 20:42.490
- Hey,are you okay?
- Yeah,I'm fine.

20:43.590 --> 20:45.380
You want to talk about it?

20:45.400 --> 20:47.910
I really don't think you'd understand.

20:51.780 --> 20:54.260
Is this about Stacey Anne?

20:55.250 --> 20:57.760
I've been thinking about her a lot,too.

20:57.770 --> 20:59.250
I mean...

20:59.280 --> 21:02.240
we knew her,and now she's dead.

21:03.030 --> 21:05.320
It's kind of a lot.

21:05.600 --> 21:08.900
I tried studying last night,
and I couldn't.

21:08.910 --> 21:12.470
No matter how rd I tried,
I couldn't get focused.

21:14.410 --> 21:16.410
Can you keep a secret?

21:19.160 --> 21:21.580
I used thave problems concentrating.

21:21.600 --> 21:24.030
Like,I'd get worked up over stuff.

21:24.060 --> 21:26.040
My doctor gave me these.

21:30.510 --> 21:32.460
Paroxetine?

21:32.480 --> 21:35.770
Yeah,he told my parents
I have a mild anxiety disorder.

21:35.800 --> 21:38.890
I mean,I started taking those,
and now I get "A"s.

21:40.070 --> 21:42.820
No one knows about this,Ariel. No one.

21:43.200 --> 21:46.090
I mean,I'm only telling you
'cause you're my best friend.

21:47.170 --> 21:49.830
So,do you want to try one,
see if it helps?

21:50.020 --> 21:52.480
But I don't have an anxiety disorder.

21:52.520 --> 21:53.900
How do you know?

21:53.930 --> 21:56.940
I mean,it sounds like you have anxiety.

22:04.070 --> 22:07.130
Okay. Maybe just one.

22:07.710 --> 22:11.160
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,I'm
afraid that it gives me no pleasure at all

22:11.170 --> 22:13.200
to talk to you this afternoon.

22:13.230 --> 22:17.450
As you know,the defendant has served
our municipality as city controller

22:17.460 --> 22:20.220
for more than 12 years now...

22:20.230 --> 22:23.860
- How's it going?
- Oh,great. He's just about done.

22:24.280 --> 22:26.930
The judge is gonna call
lunch recess any minute.

22:27.440 --> 22:29.000
Well,I need to talk to him.

22:29.040 --> 22:30.670
Will you tell him
I'll be waiting outside?

22:30.671 --> 22:31.071
Yeah.

22:31.080 --> 22:35.720
an abuse of power so flagrant,
the mayor's office itself contacted...

22:37.000 --> 22:39.310
I don't want to leave. I really don't.

22:41.010 --> 22:43.760
I just don't know how
I could pass this up.

22:48.360 --> 22:50.910
Sir,you're not saying anything.

22:51.840 --> 22:54.240
Sorry,I was thinking
about my stock portfolio.

22:54.250 --> 22:57.900
I have a small position in
the Lydecker Corporation,and...

22:58.570 --> 23:02.120
I'm thinking now might be
a good time to double it.

23:04.310 --> 23:06.740
So you're saying I should take it.

23:06.760 --> 23:08.850
How do you not take it?

23:08.890 --> 23:12.030
I wish I could tempt you with a
counteroffer,but this is a city office;

23:12.080 --> 23:14.620
the numbers that you're talking about,
the benefits,

23:14.621 --> 23:17.321
the governor doesn't make that much.

23:19.440 --> 23:20.870
Look,uh...

23:20.910 --> 23:24.260
as sad as I'm gonna be
to see you go,and...

23:25.670 --> 23:31.530
as valuable as you are,you're talking
about your family's future here. I...

23:32.250 --> 23:34.790
I don't see how you can
leave that on the table.

23:38.140 --> 23:39.510
They want me to start right away.

23:39.540 --> 23:42.930
In fact,they're insisting
that I start on Monday. But...

23:42.940 --> 23:46.720
leaving you while we're in the middle
of this whole serial killer thing,I...

23:46.740 --> 23:51.320
Allison,I admire your dedication,
but believe it or not,

23:51.370 --> 23:53.760
we used to catch criminals
before you came to work for us,

23:53.800 --> 23:57.850
and I'm betting that we can keep
on catching 'em once you're gone.

23:57.870 --> 24:00.160
But,uh...

24:01.500 --> 24:03.650
damn,I'm gonna miss you.

24:07.090 --> 24:09.440
I'm gonna miss you.

24:09.780 --> 24:12.160
That doesn't mean I can't pick up
the phone and give you a...

24:12.170 --> 24:15.200
a call from...
from time to time,right?

24:15.210 --> 24:17.120
You better.

24:38.760 --> 24:40.830
I'm home!

24:46.470 --> 24:48.330
What's going on?
What's all this stuff?

24:48.340 --> 24:51.280
- Hi,Mom!
- I've got presents.

24:51.290 --> 24:54.600
Caitlyn Lynch and the people
at Lydecker sent them over.

24:56.500 --> 24:59.430
We love Lydecker! We love Lydecker!

25:10.600 --> 25:13.150
Oh,man,I hope I'm doing the right thing.

25:13.170 --> 25:16.200
Well,if it makes you feel any better,
they certainly sent nice gifts.

25:16.220 --> 25:19.310
I'm not psychic,
but I know what you're thinking.

25:19.320 --> 25:21.070
Just because good things
are happening for you,

25:21.110 --> 25:23.950
just because good things are happening
for us does not necessarily mean that

25:23.980 --> 25:26.280
there are bad things
right around the corner.

25:26.310 --> 25:27.430
It doesn't?

25:27.460 --> 25:30.060
Why aren't you entitled to a nice job?

25:30.100 --> 25:32.110
Working with people
who want to pay you well

25:32.111 --> 25:35.011
and treat you like
you're special,which you are.

25:35.070 --> 25:36.560
Why? Come on.

25:36.570 --> 25:38.700
You be happy for you;
I'm happy for you.

25:38.730 --> 25:41.470
You deserve it. Now you be
happy for you. Now,come on.

25:41.480 --> 25:43.020
Get up off that bed.

25:43.050 --> 25:45.450
Let's round up the girls,
and let's go celebrate.

25:45.470 --> 25:48.050
Yeah,I'm talking,
let's go crazy. Crazy.

25:48.060 --> 25:50.400
Let's order appetizers and desserts.

25:50.420 --> 25:53.430
Yeah,I'm talking...
I'm talking valet the car.

25:53.940 --> 25:55.450
I don't know if I can handle this.

25:55.470 --> 25:58.170
Oh,yeah,yeah,yeah.
I'm talking let's lose our minds.

25:58.180 --> 26:00.280
I'm-I'm gonna throw
caution to the wind.

26:00.300 --> 26:03.550
I might even... I might
even draw on the place mat.

26:03.560 --> 26:06.060
Girls,your father's
starting to scare me!

26:06.080 --> 26:08.110
Ooh,yeah,yeah.

26:36.760 --> 26:38.480
Knock,knock.

26:39.340 --> 26:42.990

26:47.960 --> 26:49.780
Great.Thanks.

26:49.850 --> 26:53.870
Hey I saw your baby mom yesterday
in court, she looks great.

26:53.880 --> 26:56.140
I can right prepare the day.

26:57.160 --> 27:01.350
You takin ever.
So the rumor ever's true.

27:01.898 --> 27:04.000

27:04.010 --> 27:07.710
I'm sorry Lee, I wanna do told you myself
I've just wanna make sure the official

27:07.720 --> 27:10.930
I'm supposed to go over there and
sign some contracts this afternoon.

27:10.960 --> 27:13.680
Heard they were backing up
a Brink's truck to your ple.

27:14.160 --> 27:16.430
Something like that.

27:17.450 --> 27:19.630
Well,I know it's not the last time
we're gonna see each other or anything,

27:19.640 --> 27:22.090
but I want you to know...

27:22.390 --> 27:24.730
I'm gonna miss working with you.

27:25.020 --> 27:27.020
Me,too.

27:38.990 --> 27:40.530

27:40.540 --> 27:42.220
So what?

27:42.260 --> 27:44.560
The P-I-L-L,stupid.
Did it help?

27:44.570 --> 27:46.950
Honestly,I kind of
forgot I even took it.

27:46.980 --> 27:48.490
You're kidding me.

27:48.500 --> 27:52.160
I mean,as far as I can tell,
it didn't do anything to me.

27:52.190 --> 27:54.840
I didn't feel any different.

27:55.570 --> 27:58.700
I guess I did get a lot of studying
done when I got home from school.

27:58.730 --> 28:00.440
The Paroxetine totally helps.

28:00.460 --> 28:02.170
I don't know. Maybe.

28:02.180 --> 28:04.650
Well,did you stop
thinking about Stacey Anne?

28:05.030 --> 28:08.220
Yeah. She didn't really give
me a reason to think about her.

28:08.630 --> 28:11.030
- Uh,library after school?
- Okay.

29:00.930 --> 29:02.890
Ariel Dubois.

29:03.190 --> 29:05.960
You're not supposed to be
in this class until third period.

29:05.970 --> 29:09.520
Sorry,Mr. Parker.
I got a little turd around.

29:11.920 --> 29:14.590
I think I know where I'm going now.

29:19.750 --> 29:22.940
Okay,last chance.

29:22.950 --> 29:26.130
You know,I'm really not
the superstar you think I am.

29:26.150 --> 29:29.350
I'm wrong almost
as often as I am right.

29:29.390 --> 29:33.320
Allison,if you actually
bat anywhere near 500,

29:33.330 --> 29:36.090
everyone here will be
deliriously happy.

29:37.860 --> 29:41.840
Okay,so first order of business.

29:41.850 --> 29:46.110
I remember reading that your insights
often come to you in your dreams.

29:46.111 --> 29:47.611
Is that true?

29:48.000 --> 29:49.480
Well,not all the time,
but certainly a lot of

29:49.481 --> 29:52.381
what I see comes to me in my sleep.

29:52.420 --> 29:53.320
What's this?

29:53.350 --> 29:55.230
That is your new file cabinet.

29:55.260 --> 29:57.090
Your company hard drive.

29:57.110 --> 30:01.030
I want you to write all your
dreams in it,all your impressions.

30:01.040 --> 30:02.650
The ones that come to you at night,

30:02.651 --> 30:05.051
the ones that come
to you during the day.

30:05.090 --> 30:07.260
I want you to log them in that book.

30:07.290 --> 30:09.410
Even if you think they have
nothing to do with Lydecker,

30:09.411 --> 30:11.511
I want you to make a note of that.

30:12.250 --> 30:14.390
You sure about "everytng"?

30:14.410 --> 30:17.330
That's a lot to write down.
That's gonna be a lot to sort through.

30:17.340 --> 30:23.500
Allison,we have just agreed to pay a small
fortune for the contents of your head.

30:24.060 --> 30:27.400
We certainly don't want to miss
anything that might pass through it.

30:29.240 --> 30:30.840
Oh,sorry.

30:31.150 --> 30:34.350
Oh,it's my boss.
It's my,my other boss.

30:34.360 --> 30:37.800
My,my current boss. Hello?

30:37.810 --> 30:40.120
Allison,I hope I haven't
gotten you at a bad time,

30:40.130 --> 30:44.340
but apparently Human Resources needs you
to sign some forms and surrender your IDs

30:44.380 --> 30:47.980
and parking pass before I can put through
the requisition for your final paycheck,

30:48.010 --> 30:52.570
so I just wanted to make sure you were,
in fact,coming back today.

30:52.600 --> 30:55.800
Ohabsolutely. I still have people
I need to say good-bye to.

30:56.060 --> 30:58.840
- Um,I should be there around 4:00.
- Fine.

30:58.850 --> 31:03.130
Just,I probly won't see you,
so,uh,leave the pass,your keys,

31:03.170 --> 31:04.650
all that stuff in your top drawer,

31:04.651 --> 31:07.851
and I'll leave all the things
you need to sign on your desk,okay?

31:07.890 --> 31:09.670
Gotta run. Due in court.

31:09.680 --> 31:11.650
Uh,bye.

31:12.840 --> 31:15.890
lcomto the Lydecker Corporation,Allison.

31:15.920 --> 31:18.590
I think you're going
to be very happy here.

31:53.250 --> 31:55.650
Surprise!

32:01.540 --> 32:04.260
Lynn's sorry she couldn't make it.
She had some doctor thing.

32:04.270 --> 32:06.450
Oh,you guys have it so easy.

32:06.470 --> 32:07.690
All you have to do is be born.

32:07.720 --> 32:09.700
You don't have to do any of the bearing.

32:09.730 --> 32:11.830
I don't want to hear it.
I didn't write the rules.

32:12.450 --> 32:15.870
That was so great.
I had no clue,none.

32:15.880 --> 32:17.710
I heard that.

32:17.730 --> 32:20.580
It's because I'm a master party planner.

32:20.600 --> 32:24.650
A master surprise party planner,
an M.S.P.P.

32:28.690 --> 32:30.590
Oh,we're gonna miss you.

32:30.610 --> 32:33.360
Come on. Don't be ridiculous.
You guys are my friends.

32:33.370 --> 32:35.430
I'm gonna call you.
You're gonna call me.

32:35.600 --> 32:37.110
Nothing's gonna change.

32:37.140 --> 32:39.020
Yeah,except you're gonna
be doing really,really well.

32:39.060 --> 32:41.050
You probably won't even want
to hang around your poor friends.

32:41.090 --> 32:42.130
Yeah,but that's okay.

32:42.140 --> 32:44.620
We'll just drive by your big,
new house,wave.

32:44.640 --> 32:46.330
Give the butler notes to give to you.

32:46.350 --> 32:48.430
- That's if we can get in the gate.
- Yeah.

32:48.440 --> 32:49.570
Well,this is nice.

32:49.610 --> 32:52.820
Now that I'm leaving,you guys are gonna
hook up and make a little comedy team.

32:52.850 --> 32:54.140
Keep each other company.

32:54.170 --> 32:55.290
She is psychic.

32:55.320 --> 32:58.730
Hate to quip and run,
but I'm a busy boy.

32:59.150 --> 33:01.410
I'm sorry I can't say anything
serious 'cause I can't...

33:01.411 --> 33:03.411
seriously believe you're going.

33:03.720 --> 33:05.720
Besides that,duty calls.

33:05.750 --> 33:07.290
Thanks to you and your damn dreams,

33:07.300 --> 33:09.130
a couple of us detectives have
to go canvass the neighborhoods

33:09.140 --> 33:11.890
around each of the victims'
apartments tonight.

33:11.900 --> 33:13.250
I feel so bad for you.

33:13.280 --> 33:18.380
Maybe if I go up to my new 30th-floor
office with the big windows,

33:18.410 --> 33:20.840
and I'll look down
and see you canvassing.

33:20.850 --> 33:23.590
That's it. I'm going. There's my ride.

33:32.530 --> 33:36.060
I'd like to introduce to you to the lead
detective on the Autumn Colville case,

33:36.100 --> 33:38.020
Detective Brad Auerbach.

33:38.050 --> 33:40.660
The famous Allison Dubois.
It's nice to meet you.

33:41.470 --> 33:43.400
Sorry to hear you're moving on.

33:43.430 --> 33:46.930
We can use all the help we can get
to figure out who's killing those girls.

33:51.850 --> 33:56.100
I'm telling you,that's the same man,
the one that I saw in my dream,

33:56.130 --> 33:58.930
the one that I saw in
Autumn Colville's apartment.

33:58.960 --> 34:00.330
Tell me you don't see it.

34:00.350 --> 34:01.620
Sure,I see it. So what?

34:01.630 --> 34:03.430
So what? What do you mean,"so what"?

34:03.440 --> 34:05.410
Allison,you're talking about
Detective Brad Auerbach.

34:05.430 --> 34:07.320
There's no way he killed those women.

34:07.340 --> 34:08.850
That man's been on
the force for 20 years.

34:08.870 --> 34:10.520
He's got more commendations
than I can count.

34:10.530 --> 34:13.020
He trained me when
I got out of the academy.

34:13.050 --> 34:15.570
Now,does Brad look like the guy
in this sketch? Yeah,sure.

34:15.580 --> 34:18.130
Truth be told,he and I had a pretty
good laugh about it earlier today.

34:18.170 --> 34:20.800
But if you're telling me
that's supposed to be Brad...

34:20.810 --> 34:24.110
Lee,that is the man I saw,
and I'm sure of it.

34:24.489 --> 34:25.730
I don't know what to say.

34:25.760 --> 34:29.020
Maybe,uh,you know,maybe you had
a little too much champagne in there.

34:29.040 --> 34:31.650
Maybe between that and everything
you've had on in your head this week,

34:31.679 --> 34:33.250
maybe you got your wires crossed.

34:33.270 --> 34:35.560
Oh,so that's it?
That's my good-bye?

34:35.570 --> 34:37.139
"Maybe you got your wires crossed?"

34:37.159 --> 34:39.460
What do you want me to do?

34:40.060 --> 34:43.739
I'm not gonna interrogate
the senior detective on the case.

34:44.730 --> 34:47.199
I can't!

34:54.530 --> 34:57.990
Let's not do this. Not today.

34:58.940 --> 35:01.150
You got too much to celebrate.

35:01.180 --> 35:05.230
I got too much to do.
You go. Make lots of money.

35:05.240 --> 35:08.570
I've got this from here,okay?

35:10.710 --> 35:13.620
I promise. I'll let you
know how it all works out.

35:16.030 --> 35:18.880
Hey,remind me: irregardless.
Word or not a word?

35:19.480 --> 35:21.850
Not a word,I think.

35:21.860 --> 35:24.300
Hey,Ash,can I ask you something?

35:24.890 --> 35:27.330
That pill you gave me the other day?

35:27.340 --> 35:29.780
It turns out you were right.
It really did help me.

35:29.790 --> 35:32.260
Think you could spare any more?

35:32.980 --> 35:35.930
Okay,well,he didn't listen to you.

35:35.940 --> 35:38.060
Or maybe he just couldn't hear you.

35:38.100 --> 35:40.430
Maybe he couldn't allow
himself to hear you.

35:40.470 --> 35:41.390
On the other hand,

35:41.391 --> 35:44.591
you gotta feel better about your
decision to leave that place,right?

35:44.600 --> 35:47.180
I mean,this time next week,
if you tell the people at Lydecker

35:47.210 --> 35:52.480
that Godzilla is gonna rise up out of the
ocean and stomp his way towards Phoenix,

35:52.490 --> 35:55.660
they're gonna start
mobilizing the National Guard.

35:55.670 --> 35:58.560
By next week,I'll be helping
the people at Lydecker decide

35:58.580 --> 36:03.060
whether the cover of their annual
report should be blue or periwinkle.

36:03.070 --> 36:07.620
But tonight,right now,
I'm worried about stopping a murderer.

36:08.040 --> 36:09.370
I get it.

36:09.400 --> 36:13.300
But you gotta remember,Scanlon and
Devalos are good at what they do.

36:13.330 --> 36:15.540
They are. They're gonna find this guy.

36:15.550 --> 36:18.920
And in the meantime,get excited.

36:18.950 --> 36:21.360
Come on! You're about
to start a new job.

36:21.370 --> 36:26.350
They're gonna be paying you money for
writing down your dreams in a book.

36:26.360 --> 36:30.880
It's more money than either of us
have ever made in our entire lives.

36:30.890 --> 36:32.480
I know,but what if I'm right?

36:32.510 --> 36:35.480
What if this detective
really is the killer?

36:35.520 --> 36:37.580
And how are Devalos and
Scanlon ever gonna catch him

36:37.630 --> 36:40.010
when he's the one heading
up the investigation?

36:40.050 --> 36:43.710
Look,you're not gonna like it,but I gotta
say,in answer to all three questions,

36:44.060 --> 36:46.800
it's not your problem anymore.

37:00.690 --> 37:01.910
Hey,this is Monica.

37:01.930 --> 37:05.570
You missed me,but if you leave your name
and number,I'll call you right back.

37:12.040 --> 37:13.480
You okay?

37:13.490 --> 37:15.860
No,no,no,I'm fine.
I just gotta call Lee.

37:15.870 --> 37:17.210
Lee? Why?

37:17.220 --> 37:19.660
You don't work for those guys anymore.

37:19.680 --> 37:22.440
Aren't you supposed to be writing
your dreams down in a journal

37:22.480 --> 37:25.630
instead of calling people
in the middle of the night?

37:31.220 --> 37:32.310
It's Scanlon.

37:32.340 --> 37:36.520
Lee,it's me. I just had another dream.
I think it happened again. Another murder.

37:36.530 --> 37:37.480
Allison...

37:37.500 --> 37:39.630
I don't know where,but I know
the girl's first name was...

37:39.640 --> 37:41.510
Monica. Dead girl's name is Monica Dobbs.

37:41.520 --> 37:43.590
I'm standing in her house right now.

37:43.900 --> 37:45.610
Her boyfriend got back
early from a business trip.

37:45.630 --> 37:47.560
Came over to surprise her.

37:47.590 --> 37:49.300
He's the one who found the body.

37:49.330 --> 37:51.710
The scene's a mess. We think the
boyfriend probably scared the killer off

37:51.720 --> 37:54.160
before he could tidy up
like he usually does.

37:54.180 --> 37:55.870
You need to find Detective Auerbach.

37:55.900 --> 37:57.760
You need to bring him in right away.

37:57.790 --> 38:00.370
- It wasn't him,Allison.
- You don't know that!

38:00.380 --> 38:01.940
Actually,I do.

38:01.950 --> 38:06.100
I've been with him all night since the
moment we left your party until right now.

38:06.110 --> 38:09.100
And the medical examiner tells us the
girl was killed about 90 minutes ago,

38:09.140 --> 38:13.450
so I don't know what you think you
saw in your dream,but you're wrong.

38:14.220 --> 38:17.020
Brad Auerbach didn't do this.
He didn't do any of it.

38:17.030 --> 38:19.340
He couldn't have.

38:33.440 --> 38:34.670
Good morning. May I help you?

38:34.680 --> 38:37.460
Yes. My name is Allison Dubois.
I'm a new employee.

38:37.470 --> 38:40.880
I was hoping that you'd have
directions and a pass here for me.

38:40.910 --> 38:42.750
Allison?

38:42.780 --> 38:45.660
I had a feeling you'd be
getting here about this time.

38:45.680 --> 38:47.580
I thought I'd welcome you in person.

38:47.600 --> 38:49.430
Are you excited about your first day?

38:49.460 --> 38:52.520
I'm excited. I'm nervous.

38:52.690 --> 38:54.410
I'm terrified.

38:54.440 --> 38:57.250
I can completely relate.
I was all of the above.

38:57.550 --> 38:59.950
Come on. Let's get started.

39:01.680 --> 39:04.080
We have a meeting with
Mr. Lydecker at 10:00.

39:04.110 --> 39:06.380
- The Mr. Lydecker?
- The one and only.

39:06.840 --> 39:08.650
He doesn't bite.

39:08.700 --> 39:10.700
Not unless he's really hungry.

39:10.940 --> 39:12.020
No,I know,I know.

39:12.040 --> 39:14.850
I just didn't expect
to meet him on the first day.

39:15.470 --> 39:17.680
Guess who works here.

39:18.390 --> 39:20.890
Someone else who has
the same name as me?

39:22.980 --> 39:24.860
Go on in.

39:33.540 --> 39:36.730
Yeah. Takes your breath away,doesn't it?

39:42.050 --> 39:46.320
- What's wrong? You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah. No,I'm fine.

39:47.120 --> 39:50.060
I just had a bad dream
about the new job.

39:50.090 --> 39:52.250
It's the first-day jitters,I guess.

39:52.280 --> 39:54.330
Well,don't worry about it.

39:54.360 --> 39:57.790
- This time tomorrow,it'll be...
- This time tomorrow.

40:00.030 --> 40:01.430
Thanks for that.

40:01.460 --> 40:03.780
That's what I'm here for.

40:05.050 --> 40:07.270
I just don't want to look out of place.

40:07.310 --> 40:11.460
Well,I've never been to the place,
so I can't be of any help in that regard.

40:11.490 --> 40:14.440
But I like... that one.

40:14.450 --> 40:16.690
No,no,no. I have a bad
feeling about that one.

40:16.700 --> 40:18.520
About a suit?

40:19.020 --> 40:22.040
I just... I want to make
a good first impression.

40:22.050 --> 40:24.540
Well,these people came after you.

40:24.550 --> 40:28.190
You have met the burden of
a first impression and conquered it.

40:28.210 --> 40:31.320
Mom,there's a big black
car in our driveway.

40:31.330 --> 40:34.560
The limo's already here,
and I'm not even dressed.

40:34.570 --> 40:37.490
Is that a limo? What's going on?

40:37.500 --> 40:40.990
Did Mommy get famous and
someone forget to tell us?

40:41.040 --> 40:42.660
No,no,no,honey. Nobody got famous.

40:42.670 --> 40:45.190
Mommy just got a new car
with her new job.

40:45.220 --> 40:46.570
They're picking me up this morning,

40:46.571 --> 40:49.271
so I'm able to drive the new car
home this evening.

40:49.280 --> 40:50.860
Cool.

40:50.890 --> 40:54.770
Wait,can we take the limo to school
and make all the other kids jealous?

40:54.800 --> 40:56.120
Bridgette.

40:56.140 --> 40:59.420
Well,can I at least go outside
and take pictures of it?

40:59.590 --> 41:02.880
You know what? You're going to have
to handle this. I don't have time.

41:06.840 --> 41:10.380
Yep? Allison?

41:10.680 --> 41:13.950
I just needed to be reassured
at God doesn't smite people

41:13.960 --> 41:17.010
who ride to work in big black
limousines with handsome drivers

41:17.050 --> 41:20.860
who offer you hot coffee and
your choice of newspapers.

41:20.900 --> 41:22.550
I can't. God does.

41:22.560 --> 41:25.760
But I hear they're all
smiling when the end does come.

41:25.800 --> 41:28.510
So,uh,they're treating you well,huh?

41:28.750 --> 41:34.180
Well,I really haven't started yet,but
"well" doesn't even begin to describe it.

41:35.900 --> 41:38.600
Do you want to hear the nutty part?

41:39.390 --> 41:41.910
I miss City Hall.

41:41.930 --> 41:44.200
Allison,it's early Monday morning.
No one's even here yet.

41:44.210 --> 41:46.210
There's nothing to have missed.

41:46.240 --> 41:49.190
You know,just before the weekend,
I had kind of a crazy hunch.

41:49.220 --> 41:52.540
Detective Scanlon didn't happen
to mention it to you,did he?

41:52.550 --> 41:54.430
It involved Detective Auerbach.

41:54.440 --> 41:57.310
No. But I've got Lee standing
in my doorway right now.

41:57.320 --> 42:00.210
Is there something
you want me to ask him?

42:00.220 --> 42:03.270
It's Allison Dubois calling from
her chauffeured limousine

42:03.271 --> 42:05.071
to say hi to the little people.

42:05.090 --> 42:07.550
Oh,yeah. Dubois.
Which one was she?

42:08.920 --> 42:10.580
All right. Never mind.

42:10.590 --> 42:13.630
Allison. Forget about this case.
Start your new job.

42:13.890 --> 42:15.560
Make a lot of money.
I may need to borrow some.

42:15.570 --> 42:18.070
Yeah,me,too. You were
always my favorite,Allison.

42:33.340 --> 42:35.290
Good morning. May I help you?

42:35.300 --> 42:36.980
Allison!

42:37.020 --> 42:39.570
I had a feeling you'd be
getting here about this time.

42:39.590 --> 42:42.250
I thought I'd welcome you in person.

42:42.260 --> 42:45.100
Excited about your first day?

42:49.550 --> 42:51.600
Guess who works here.

42:51.610 --> 42:54.250
Someone else with the same name as me?

42:56.130 --> 42:58.190
Go on in.

42:58.470 --> 43:00.910
Please. You do the honors.

43:07.790 --> 43:11.010
Yeah. Takes your breath away,
doesn't it?

43:18.270 --> 43:19.570
It's amazing.

43:19.600 --> 43:21.760
I'm glad you like it.

43:22.500 --> 43:25.760
You're going to be spending
a lot of time in here.

43:25.770 --> 43:27.630
I'm going to be forwarding you
a lot of material,

43:27.631 --> 43:30.231
and I want your impression
on all of it.

43:30.240 --> 43:35.600
As far as how you get those impressions,
well,if you need to kick off your shoes,

43:35.630 --> 43:39.220
stretch out on your chair,
let your mind wander...

43:39.230 --> 43:40.800
It's all part of the job.

43:40.850 --> 43:43.090
What,napping's part
of my job description?

43:43.490 --> 43:45.720
I call it "contemplation time."

43:45.730 --> 43:48.950
It keeps the other people
around here from getting jealous.

43:48.960 --> 43:52.400
But,to answer your question,yes.
Naps are cool.

43:52.960 --> 43:58.870
As long as you keep an accurate log of
everything you see and pass it on to me.

43:59.470 --> 44:03.520
There is one other thing that
I think we should take care of today

44:03.530 --> 44:06.100
after our meeting with Mr. Lydecker.

44:07.810 --> 44:10.980
How about you and I go
on a little shopping trip?

44:11.930 --> 44:13.990
Shopping?

44:15.790 --> 44:19.660
I don't pretend to understand
exactly what it is that Caitlyn does,

44:19.670 --> 44:23.150
but I am pragmatic enough
to see that it works.

44:25.680 --> 44:27.930
And now I found you,Allison.

44:28.360 --> 44:30.660
Caitlyn tells me you have quite a gift.

44:30.670 --> 44:33.000
Yes. That's what
she keeps telling me,too.

44:33.010 --> 44:36.610
I will try to not you down

44:36.630 --> 44:38.810
no u won't.

44:39.240 --> 44:42.170
Because I have enormous
confidence in you.

44:43.170 --> 44:47.630
This corporation thrives
because we excel at two things:

44:47.670 --> 44:51.270
innovation and secrecy.

44:51.560 --> 44:53.980
We breed the next generation of ideas.

44:54.020 --> 44:56.640
And then we manage and
we cultivate those ideas,

44:56.670 --> 45:02.020
confident that our competitors
have no clue what we're up to.

45:02.300 --> 45:06.720
So,naturally,that creates a lot
of temptation for our employees.

45:06.730 --> 45:09.210
It would be very easy for
someone to supplement their income

45:09.240 --> 45:14.770
by leaking company secrets to
the press or to one of our competitors.

45:15.250 --> 45:18.520
These our employee dossiers.

45:18.530 --> 45:20.970
I'd like you to spend
some time with them.

45:21.940 --> 45:25.820
See if there's anyone among
this group that gives you pause.

45:40.720 --> 45:43.570
I'd be very anxious
to hear what you have to say.

45:45.200 --> 45:48.700
Ariel,I don't believe it.
You got a perfect score. In math.

45:48.710 --> 45:50.640
I didn't even think that was possible.

45:50.660 --> 45:52.380
It was just a practice test.

45:52.410 --> 45:54.440
Still,I hate you.

45:55.110 --> 45:57.660
It's your fault,you know.
It's those pills.

45:57.670 --> 46:00.670
I don't know. I look the pills,
too,and I only got a 488.

46:01.630 --> 46:06.670
No,I mean,without those pills,
there's no way I'd be able to do this.

46:06.680 --> 46:10.280
There's no way I'd be able
to focus or concentrate.

46:11.460 --> 46:13.410
That reminds me...

46:13.440 --> 46:15.690
I'm going to need some more.

46:15.880 --> 46:17.910
Look,I don't think I can.

46:17.940 --> 46:20.940
I just gave you a bunch. I don't
refill my prescription till next week.

46:22.500 --> 46:24.080
How about just one?

46:24.120 --> 46:26.340
I don't have one.

46:26.350 --> 46:29.100
You know my father counts these.

46:29.780 --> 46:31.130
Stop looking at me like that.

46:31.140 --> 46:33.930
You're forgetting
I actually need this stuff.

46:38.670 --> 46:40.790
I don't get it.

46:40.830 --> 46:43.980
I thought this was about you
being upset over Stacey Anne.

46:44.860 --> 46:47.500
You're not still upset
about her,are you?

46:53.930 --> 46:56.550
Look,all right,
but I can only give you two more.

46:56.560 --> 46:59.950
This is the last time,seriously.

47:32.380 --> 47:34.670
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

47:36.880 --> 47:39.450
Okay,I give up.

47:39.460 --> 47:41.820
I'm sorry? Did you say something?

47:41.830 --> 47:46.650
I said,"I give up," trying to figure out
what's going on in that brain of yours.

47:46.970 --> 47:48.970
I can't read your expression.

47:49.010 --> 47:51.780
Well,my expression,that's,uh...

47:51.810 --> 47:55.070
Exhaustion. And amazement.

47:55.420 --> 47:57.920
This has been an incredible day.

47:57.950 --> 47:59.270
You're happy?

47:59.300 --> 48:00.630
No,I'm miserable.

48:00.650 --> 48:04.570
You're buying me clothes,
buying me a car.

48:04.610 --> 48:07.360
I get to meet Mr. Lydecker...

48:07.380 --> 48:09.090
He's pretty impressive,isn't he?

48:09.120 --> 48:13.430
He's one of the most charismatic,
uh,intimidating,fascinating...

48:13.450 --> 48:15.620
Tell me about it.

48:17.270 --> 48:19.860
You know,I saw him cry.

48:20.040 --> 48:21.590
I'm sorry?

48:21.620 --> 48:25.180
Well,we were sitting in
his office and I had a...

48:25.190 --> 48:27.920
I mean,he was just sobbing.

48:27.950 --> 48:30.530
It was as if someone had died.

48:30.540 --> 48:33.080
Have you ever seen anything like that?

48:33.090 --> 48:38.780
I've worked for the man
for almost a decade,and no.

48:40.320 --> 48:43.540
You must be very good.

48:44.630 --> 48:49.560
I think that this is one insight that
you should probably keep out of your log.

48:50.870 --> 48:53.420
Yes,of course.

48:55.060 --> 48:57.200
- See anything?
- Nope.

48:59.460 --> 49:01.300
Yep.

49:02.780 --> 49:08.250
Dad! Ariel! I think she's coming!

49:11.610 --> 49:13.630
Can I borrow it?

49:15.160 --> 49:18.330
Hey,ask me how my first day was.

49:22.930 --> 49:25.480
You're smiling.

49:25.740 --> 49:27.300
I'm sorry. Did you say something?

49:27.310 --> 49:29.700
I said,"You're smiling."

49:29.720 --> 49:32.270
Oh,I guess I am.

49:33.280 --> 49:36.400
I actually had a pretty wonderful day.

49:36.800 --> 49:40.060
I can't believe
I hesitated to take this job.

49:40.070 --> 49:42.530
Everyone there is so nice.

49:42.570 --> 49:46.690
I mean,not that everybody at the district
attorney's office isn't nice,but...

49:48.410 --> 49:52.590
It's kind of refreshing not
to ponder death and evil every day.

50:02.710 --> 50:04.340
So what now?

50:04.360 --> 50:09.040
Dreams of new products and
profit and loss statements?

50:09.060 --> 50:11.370
We can only hope.

50:12.030 --> 50:15.250
We can only hope.

50:32.920 --> 50:35.710
<i>750 Wick Ave APT B</i>

51:12.670 --> 51:15.170
<i>Sleep tight</i>

51:56.100 --> 51:57.420
I saw it,Lee.

51:57.460 --> 52:00.560
Someone texted him the address
of Autumn Colville's apartment.

52:00.580 --> 52:01.780
But he didn't kill her.

52:01.810 --> 52:03.760
He just cleaned up after whoever did.

52:03.790 --> 52:05.820
You sound like what
I'm saying is absurd.

52:05.860 --> 52:07.670
I know. There's a reason for that.

52:08.000 --> 52:09.700
Allison,why would Brad Auerbach,

52:09.701 --> 52:12.301
the guy who's heading up the task
force to catch this butcher,

52:12.350 --> 52:13.730
drive out in the middle of the night

52:13.731 --> 52:17.131
and cut up bodies into easily
disposable pieces for him?

52:17.160 --> 52:18.120
Doesn't make sense.

52:18.150 --> 52:20.880
I don't know,maybe he knows the killer
and he's trying to protect him.

52:20.890 --> 52:22.780
Maybe he's getting paid for it.

52:22.810 --> 52:24.770
What difference does it make,Lee?

52:24.800 --> 52:26.550
He's doing it.

52:27.280 --> 52:29.830
No. Sorry.

52:29.840 --> 52:31.650
You're talking about Brad Auerbach.

52:31.680 --> 52:33.810
You're talking about a fellow detective.

52:33.830 --> 52:35.050
Okay,look,I get it.

52:35.051 --> 52:38.051
You respect the guy.
And-and maybe I'm crazy.

52:38.860 --> 52:40.120
But there has got to be a way

52:40.121 --> 52:42.621
that you can look into this without
setting off alarms,

52:42.650 --> 52:44.890
without embarrassing yourself.

52:44.920 --> 52:47.310
If you could just ask him about the bag.

52:47.350 --> 52:52.730
There,there was this case that
he was using,this big,rolling black bag.

52:53.120 --> 52:56.520
He put all his tools in it,
everything he needed to clean up.

52:56.550 --> 53:00.000
It was like a,a salesman's case.

53:01.890 --> 53:04.070
Or don't.

53:04.510 --> 53:06.980
- Say hi to Lynn.
- Don't do that.

53:09.440 --> 53:12.710
A big,black case. I'll try.

53:14.400 --> 53:16.250
Thank you.

53:22.250 --> 53:22.970
Hello?

53:22.971 --> 53:26.371
Joe,hi. This is Bill Whitaker,
Ashley's dad.

53:26.380 --> 53:29.430
Uh,we met at one of those,
uh,parent-teacher tngs.

53:29.450 --> 53:31.250
Do you have a minute?

53:31.260 --> 53:34.390
And this is the only employee
that you're worried about?

53:34.410 --> 53:37.320
Well,he's really the only
person who jumped out at me.

53:37.350 --> 53:41.030
I mean,he's the only person
I had a strong response to.

53:41.040 --> 53:43.730
A strong negative response.

53:43.750 --> 53:47.200
It's... it's hard to put into words.

53:47.860 --> 53:51.570
So there's nothing specific,
nothing that you can...

53:52.080 --> 53:53.200
put your finger on. Just...

53:53.210 --> 53:58.010
Just a kind of darkness.
Towards the company. Towards you.

54:02.860 --> 54:04.790
I'm sorry. I wish I had more to offer.

54:04.800 --> 54:07.450
I really don't even know
what he es for the company.

54:07.480 --> 54:10.680
Most of the information in his file
was blacked out with a marker.

54:10.700 --> 54:12.880
That's quite all right.

54:13.710 --> 54:16.340
I'm very familiar with
this particular employee.

54:16.370 --> 54:18.650
I appreciate your input.

54:19.030 --> 54:21.870
I'll handle this matter personally.

54:22.210 --> 54:24.710
When Mr. Lydecker says he's going
to handle something personally,

54:24.711 --> 54:25.811
what does that mean?

54:25.840 --> 54:27.030
What does it mean?

54:27.060 --> 54:30.360
It means that if he suspects
someone of being dislol,

54:30.390 --> 54:35.060
that person usually find themselves
being transferred off of our key projects.

54:35.100 --> 54:38.580
Basically,they're benched
until their contract runs out.

54:38.610 --> 54:42.040
Usually,they get the message
before then and move on.

54:42.070 --> 54:46.330
So if I share my impressions about
someone,I could ruin their career?

54:46.350 --> 54:49.170
Are you worried about
that kid you pointed out?

54:49.180 --> 54:52.350
Relax. Nothing's going to happen to him.

54:52.360 --> 54:55.450
He's kind of a... special case.

54:55.980 --> 54:59.600
He's Justin Lydecker.
Mr. Lydecker's son.

54:59.610 --> 55:02.480
Oh,my God. I just accused
the CEO's son of,of...

55:02.490 --> 55:05.640
Being exactly who he is.

55:05.650 --> 55:07.530
Trust me,Allison.

55:07.560 --> 55:11.000
You are not the first person
to point out that Justin Lydecker

55:11.040 --> 55:14.440
is never going to become
the employee of the month.

55:14.470 --> 55:20.860
He's kind of a running joke around here,the
poster boy for just say yes to anything.

55:21.060 --> 55:23.110
Drugs,clubbing...

55:23.120 --> 55:26.460
Lots of days Justin doesn't even
bother to show up around here.

55:26.490 --> 55:30.330
I don't know why Mr. Lydecker
even bothers to keep him around.

55:30.350 --> 55:34.660
I know he used to think that one day
maybe Justin would take over for him.

55:34.680 --> 55:38.400
Now,I think he prays
that kid lives to see 30.

55:38.410 --> 55:40.910
Mrs. Dubois? Your husband
called several times.

55:40.920 --> 55:43.620
He said he needs to speak
with you as soon as possible.

55:43.680 --> 55:46.420
Thank you. Excuse me.

56:00.290 --> 56:03.060
Aren't you guys
supposed to be at work?

56:03.070 --> 56:06.230
I got a call from
Ashley's father today.

56:06.250 --> 56:07.970
He's convinced that
his daughter is sharing

56:07.971 --> 56:10.171
 her antianxiety medication with you.

56:11.270 --> 56:12.970
Tell us this isn't true.

56:13.000 --> 56:16.820
Or that there's some aspect
of it that we don't understand.

56:18.940 --> 56:21.010
It's complicated.

56:21.050 --> 56:23.290
I'll bet it is.

56:24.090 --> 56:26.840
It wasn't for fun or anything.

56:26.880 --> 56:29.820
There was nothing fun about it.

56:30.330 --> 56:31.750
I just...

56:31.780 --> 56:33.750
the PSATs are coming up,and...

56:33.751 --> 56:35.951
there's this girl and
she won't leave me alone,

56:35.980 --> 56:38.850
and she won't let me
study or concentrate...

56:38.851 --> 56:40.151
Wait a second. Hold on.
Hold on. What girl?

56:40.960 --> 56:43.650
Stacey Anne Burrows.

56:43.660 --> 56:46.930
Okay,so you took drugs?
That makes no sense.

56:46.940 --> 56:49.770
Not drugs.

56:50.470 --> 56:53.290
It's like you said.
It's Ashley's prescription.

56:53.780 --> 56:55.640
And she takes it so she can concentrate.

56:55.660 --> 56:58.610
And that's why I took it,and it worked.

56:59.110 --> 57:01.950
She left me alone.

57:03.700 --> 57:06.110
Stacy Anne just...

57:13.010 --> 57:15.870
Wha... wha-what am I missing?

57:20.790 --> 57:24.060
Stacey Anne... is she dead?

57:33.650 --> 57:38.650
I was 14 when I first started stealing
beers to push the voices down

57:38.660 --> 57:40.890
to keep the ghosts away.

57:40.900 --> 57:42.720
I hate this.

57:42.780 --> 57:44.220
I already lived through this once.

57:44.230 --> 57:46.530
Why does she have to live through it?

57:48.400 --> 57:51.140
I want to be smart about this.

57:51.150 --> 57:53.700
We need to be smart about this.

57:53.710 --> 57:55.660
Of course.

58:22.580 --> 58:24.300
Lee?

58:25.300 --> 58:27.590
Jeez,buddy. What the hell are
you doing here at this hour?

58:27.600 --> 58:30.930
It's a good thing I got
a change of underwear inside.

58:30.940 --> 58:32.700
New development in the case.

58:32.740 --> 58:35.660
I was in the area,knew you
were just getting off detail...

58:35.680 --> 58:37.340
Thought I'd take a shot.

58:37.380 --> 58:39.000
At 2:00 in the morning?

58:39.020 --> 58:41.160
You sure you weren't waiting for me?

58:41.200 --> 58:43.990
It seems like maybe
you were waiting for me.

58:45.900 --> 58:48.550
Yeah,well,I guess maybe I was.

58:48.560 --> 58:51.010
Maybe I was waiting for you.

58:51.020 --> 58:54.330
All right,so what's the big break?

58:54.340 --> 58:57.810
Turns out it's a team. Two guys.

58:58.850 --> 59:00.690
One guy does the deed.

59:00.720 --> 59:04.800
The other,he comes in after the fact,
gets rid of the body,cleans up.

59:04.830 --> 59:06.660
Knows what he's doing,too.

59:06.700 --> 59:09.150
Leaves the place forensically spotless.

59:09.540 --> 59:11.390
Okay.

59:11.430 --> 59:13.440
And where'd you get this?

59:13.450 --> 59:15.460
I mean who are you talking
to that I'm not talking to ?

59:15.461 --> 59:17.161
Why? You want a name?

59:17.370 --> 59:19.960
Yeah. I want a name.

59:20.040 --> 59:23.260
I want to talk to the guy,'cause
I got to say,that doesn't sound right.

59:24.190 --> 59:27.610
I mean,I've heard of serial
killers working in pairs before.

59:27.630 --> 59:33.930
You know,like thrill-killers taking turns,
but nothing like what you're describing.

59:36.720 --> 59:40.010
No,it doesn't make sense. I mean,
what's in it for the guy who cleans?

59:40.300 --> 59:42.100
I don't know. Money maybe.

59:42.610 --> 59:45.390
Maybe the guy doesn't make that much.

59:47.640 --> 59:49.890
Maybe the guy's a cop.

59:52.130 --> 59:54.130
Well,that's nuts.

59:54.140 --> 59:58.020
Yeah,well,the thing is,
I need to look in that case,Brad.

01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:04.320
Me? You think it's me?

01:00:04.330 --> 01:00:07.240
I think I need to look in that case.

01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:13.630
What are you doing,man?
Have you lost your mind?

01:00:14.550 --> 01:00:16.590
It's me. It's Brad.

01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:19.160
Well,then the case doesn't matter.

01:00:23.140 --> 01:00:25.340
Fine.

01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:28.780
I'm not a good forgetter,Lee.

01:00:29.610 --> 01:00:34.680
Just so you know,when this is over,
I'm not a good forgetter.

01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:45.770
- Yeah?
- Lee,it's Allison.

01:00:45.780 --> 01:00:47.190
Are you all right?

01:00:47.230 --> 01:00:48.780
Yeah. Yeah,I'm fine.

01:00:48.790 --> 01:00:51.350
My God,I just had
the most horrible dream.

01:00:51.380 --> 01:00:55.030
Detective Auerbach shot you.

01:00:55.410 --> 01:00:57.860
Yeah,well,not to worry.
Your dream was wrong.

01:00:57.870 --> 01:01:00.620
Detective Auerbach didn't kill me.

01:01:01.220 --> 01:01:03.850
I killed him.

01:01:17.370 --> 01:01:19.130
You okay?

01:01:19.730 --> 01:01:22.110
I don't know.
Manny's gonna tell us in a minute.

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:24.480
He's been on the phone for an hour.

01:01:24.510 --> 01:01:28.120
The governor,
the chief of police,forensics.

01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:29.930
You're still shaking.

01:01:29.970 --> 01:01:31.600
No,I'm fine.

01:01:32.790 --> 01:01:34.330
Good news.

01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:37.240
Forensics just finished it's
preliminary analysis on the items

01:01:37.250 --> 01:01:40.000
from that black case
in Auerbach's garage.

01:01:40.030 --> 01:01:44.260
For starters,there was a power saw with
traces of skin,blood,and bone on the blade.

01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:47.580
Obviously,we still need to make
a DNA match with the victims,

01:01:47.610 --> 01:01:51.660
but,um,from the sound of it,
I think you're going to be okay.

01:01:51.670 --> 01:01:54.000
Maybe even better than okay.

01:01:54.020 --> 01:01:57.990
Everybody's on board: the mayor,
the governor,the chief of police.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.070
You're a hero,Lee.

01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:03.630
The guy drew on me. I'm no hero.

01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:06.450
Sorry it took me so long to hear you.

01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:08.550
It's okay.
I'm just happy you're alive.

01:02:09.060 --> 01:02:11.900
We're all just happy that you're alive.

01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:14.650
Doesn't seem fair.

01:02:14.690 --> 01:02:17.130
We can review Brad's bank statements,
check out his phone logs,

01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:21.620
see if we can figure out who his sick
partner is,but if nothing shakes loose...

01:02:21.630 --> 01:02:22.920
I didn't just kill a bad cop.

01:02:22.940 --> 01:02:28.000
I shot the only guy on the planet who
can definitely tell us who our killer is.

01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:44.420
You scared me.

01:02:44.450 --> 01:02:46.210
Sorry.

01:02:47.090 --> 01:02:49.800
I was out most of the night.

01:02:49.820 --> 01:02:51.590
Stuff from my old job.

01:02:51.610 --> 01:02:55.430
When I finally got back here,
I couldn't get to sleep.

01:02:56.370 --> 01:02:59.120
I just kept thinking...

01:02:59.130 --> 01:03:01.530
thinking about you.

01:03:03.110 --> 01:03:06.150
Hey,I want you to go to the doctor.

01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:10.260
But it has to be somebody who
knows about me... about how I am.

01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:14.040
Hopefully have some kind of
sympathy for how difficult it can be.

01:03:17.170 --> 01:03:20.530
I don't think I get what you're saying.

01:03:20.900 --> 01:03:25.660
I did a little research on
that medicine you were taking.

01:03:27.070 --> 01:03:29.260
It's pretty common.

01:03:29.270 --> 01:03:31.590
A lot of people take it.

01:03:31.830 --> 01:03:34.580
The Web site says that...

01:03:34.590 --> 01:03:37.860
the side effects are very minimal.

01:03:38.780 --> 01:03:40.670
Only...

01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:46.980
I started wondering what high
school would have been like for me

01:03:46.990 --> 01:03:51.030
if I had a drug like that,
people to talk to.

01:03:56.510 --> 01:03:58.490
What?

01:04:01.150 --> 01:04:02.960
I'm awake,right?

01:04:02.970 --> 01:04:07.610
Hey,I still think what you did
was incredibly reckless.

01:04:09.030 --> 01:04:11.610
Incredibly dangerous.

01:04:11.620 --> 01:04:14.230
You can never do that again.

01:04:15.130 --> 01:04:19.770
And part of me cannot even believe
that we're having this conversation.

01:04:22.970 --> 01:04:25.370
But Daddy and I talked.

01:04:27.300 --> 01:04:29.140
And...

01:04:29.180 --> 01:04:34.050
if the doctor thinks that medication
will improve the quality of your life...

01:04:34.890 --> 01:04:38.060
Mom,can I ask you something?

01:04:39.050 --> 01:04:41.500
If you can't get me
an appointment right away,

01:04:41.530 --> 01:04:44.930
can I just use the rest of Ashley's
pills just to get me through the test?

01:04:44.940 --> 01:04:50.930
No. Honey,we promised we would give
those pills back to Ashley's parents.

01:04:51.270 --> 01:04:56.640
And until a doctor tells us that there's
a medicine that makes sense for you...

01:04:58.530 --> 01:05:03.760
But I promise that I will try to get
that appointment as soon as possible.

01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:09.550
And until then,well,
I'm a good listener.

01:05:12.270 --> 01:05:16.500
So do you want early breakfast,or do
you want to sleep another 30 minutes?

01:05:16.510 --> 01:05:18.240
Sleep.

01:05:18.990 --> 01:05:20.450
Okay.

01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:25.310
Mom.

01:05:30.620 --> 01:05:33.110
Shove over.

01:05:55.460 --> 01:05:57.920
When did you realize he was my son?

01:06:01.060 --> 01:06:03.240
Caitlyn told me.

01:06:08.780 --> 01:06:11.160
Why do you look so frightened?

01:06:11.190 --> 01:06:13.450
Do I look frightened?

01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:15.970
Yes,you look terrified.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:19.520
And why are you standing by the door?

01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:21.880
Come into the room. Have a seat.

01:06:29.540 --> 01:06:32.090
I went to see Justin yesterday.

01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:35.520
I told him I had some
concerns about his lifestyle.

01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:38.410
It's nothing I haven't said
to him before.

01:06:38.430 --> 01:06:41.030
Usually he ignores me.

01:06:41.050 --> 01:06:43.910
But this time he insisted
that I was wrong.

01:06:43.930 --> 01:06:47.020
Says that he's finally ready
to become a grown-up.

01:06:47.050 --> 01:06:50.180
Take some responsibility for his life...

01:06:50.190 --> 01:06:52.280
his work.

01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:56.990
I was wondering if you'd mind
meeting with him.

01:06:57.010 --> 01:07:00.130
I'd be very curious
to hear your impressions.

01:07:00.140 --> 01:07:03.440
See if you think that he has
actually turned a corner in his life.

01:07:11.010 --> 01:07:14.220
So,this is exciting.

01:07:14.230 --> 01:07:17.840
I'm one of the first people in the
company to get a look at my dad's new toy.

01:07:19.070 --> 01:07:21.560
I don't think your father
thinks of me as a toy.

01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:23.190
No,I know.

01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:26.360
But you should realize that
you are now officially topic #1

01:07:26.370 --> 01:07:29.530
around the water
cooler here at Lydecker.

01:07:31.070 --> 01:07:36.090
Everybody knows you do the same thing
that Caitlyn does,and honestly,

01:07:36.140 --> 01:07:38.860
I think they're
a little surprised that...

01:07:38.861 --> 01:07:41.561
my dad would bring
in another six-figure napper.

01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:46.590
There's far more to my job
than taking naps.

01:07:46.610 --> 01:07:50.470
Your father is interested
in my impressions of things...

01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:53.700
people,which is why I think he
wanted me to sit down with you.

01:07:53.710 --> 01:07:55.520
Yeah. That's what I figured.

01:07:55.530 --> 01:07:57.590
He wants you to tell him
if his only son is

01:07:57.591 --> 01:07:59.791
permanently screwed up
or if I can be...

01:08:00.020 --> 01:08:01.660
salvaged.

01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:04.020
That's not exactly the way he put it.

01:08:04.070 --> 01:08:07.880
No,but that is what he wants to know.

01:08:07.890 --> 01:08:11.180
And honestly,
I can't really blame him.

01:08:11.190 --> 01:08:14.610
I've spent most of the last
decade disappointing the man.

01:08:14.630 --> 01:08:19.300
DUIs,assault charges,
all those stints in rehab.

01:08:19.319 --> 01:08:19.930
I mean,it's...

01:08:19.930 --> 01:08:24.131
it's hardly a secret that I've been
a total disaster for a long time.

01:08:30.279 --> 01:08:34.350
Look... I know that my dad
doesn't trust me.

01:08:35.290 --> 01:08:37.450
I can't blame him.

01:08:37.470 --> 01:08:39.069
But I'm 26 years old,

01:08:39.071 --> 01:08:43.270
and my greatest accomplishment
in life is-is sleeping with a girl

01:08:43.279 --> 01:08:47.069
who came in second place
on a reality show.

01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:54.359
I guess I'm just tired of being a joke.

01:08:55.250 --> 01:08:58.590
And all that dark stuff is in the past.

01:08:59.380 --> 01:09:01.620
And I want to change.

01:09:01.670 --> 01:09:03.750
I have changed.

01:09:32.189 --> 01:09:33.529
Look,I have to be honest with you.

01:09:33.580 --> 01:09:36.979
I don't really believe in what you do.

01:09:37.350 --> 01:09:41.470
But I know that my dad does.

01:09:41.939 --> 01:09:43.600
So please...

01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:47.901
I'd really appreciate it if you'd tell him
that his prodigal son is doing just fine.

01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:12.530
I remember you.

01:10:13.450 --> 01:10:14.940
You hungry?

01:10:14.990 --> 01:10:19.530
That would involve chewing and I don't
think I have the strength for that.

01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:22.800
Where is everybody?

01:10:22.810 --> 01:10:25.070
They're asleep.
It's after 10:00,sweetie.

01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:27.150
Great.

01:10:27.510 --> 01:10:29.330
Suicide?

01:10:29.370 --> 01:10:35.200
I kept leaving messages for Mr. Lydecker,
explaining that it was urgent.

01:10:35.220 --> 01:10:36.140
He never called back.

01:10:36.170 --> 01:10:41.310
Then I tried to tell Caitlyn,
but she was with him behind closed doors.

01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:46.830
I just feel like crying.

01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:49.180
I mean,that boy...

01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:54.440
That boy must have had every
possible advantage in life.

01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:57.430
And even with that,he's so unhappy.

01:10:57.480 --> 01:11:01.090
He's ready to stick a gun
in his mouth and pull the trigger.

01:11:03.650 --> 01:11:05.870
How does that happen?

01:11:06.310 --> 01:11:09.770
I don't know. I've been
asking myself that for hours.

01:11:10.150 --> 01:11:12.270
What didn't he get?

01:11:12.290 --> 01:11:14.390
What didn't his father give him?

01:11:14.410 --> 01:11:15.900
Time,maybe?

01:11:15.930 --> 01:11:19.630
Was he too busy building
an empire to be a good father?

01:11:20.340 --> 01:11:23.080
And the punch line is...

01:11:24.620 --> 01:11:30.360
I come home from work and I miss dinner
again and my girls are already asleep.

01:11:30.370 --> 01:11:32.410
Oh,come on.
I don't think it's the same thing.

01:11:32.420 --> 01:11:34.660
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

01:11:36.030 --> 01:11:38.340
I hope you're right.

01:11:39.900 --> 01:11:43.020
Take one test booklet
and pass the others back.

01:11:43.850 --> 01:11:48.590
You will have 25 minutes
for part one of the exam.

01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:53.670
Before you begin,be sure to complete
the personal information in section A.

01:11:54.350 --> 01:11:57.870
Please be sure that you fill
in all of the ovals completely.

01:11:59.100 --> 01:12:01.800
You should be using a #2 pencil.

01:12:01.810 --> 01:12:04.260
If your pencil breaks,
I have extras here at my desk.

01:12:04.290 --> 01:12:07.470
Please raise your hand and
you may come up to get one.

01:12:12.590 --> 01:12:14.970
Eyes on your own paper,please.

01:12:18.180 --> 01:12:22.390
Abraham Lincoln was
America's greatest president.

01:12:23.130 --> 01:12:24.470
Check your spelling on "president."

01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:27.010
I think you've got a couple of
extra Es kicking around in there.

01:12:27.020 --> 01:12:29.130
Okay,Daddy.

01:12:29.140 --> 01:12:31.730
Lincoln's mother died in infancy.

01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:35.120
And he was born in a log cabin,
which he built.

01:12:35.820 --> 01:12:37.550
You might want to check
your facts on that.

01:12:37.580 --> 01:12:41.460
If Lincoln's mom died when she was
an infant,there would be no Lincoln.

01:12:41.470 --> 01:12:44.930
Nope. I think you're wrong about that.
That's what our teacher told us.

01:12:44.940 --> 01:12:47.340
Yeah,I heard that,too.

01:12:47.350 --> 01:12:50.470
Uh,Dad? Where's Mom?

01:12:50.790 --> 01:12:53.650
Uh,I don't know,sweetie.
She had to go in extra early today.

01:12:55.350 --> 01:12:57.120
Is something wrong?

01:12:57.130 --> 01:13:00.570
Do you think there's any way that you
could get me in to see the doctor today?

01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:03.260
Today? Uh,I don't think so,honey.

01:13:03.270 --> 01:13:06.700
Um,the doctor that Mom has in mind is
out of town till the end of the week.

01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:07.660
Why? What's going on?

01:13:07.670 --> 01:13:11.290
Just... I had this dream,
this crazy dream.

01:13:11.300 --> 01:13:12.830
Okay.

01:13:12.870 --> 01:13:16.420
Well,you know,bad dreams are really
your mom's area of expertise. But,uh...

01:13:16.430 --> 01:13:18.630
It's okay. It's probably nothing.

01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:20.730
It's not like it even
made a lot of sense.

01:13:20.750 --> 01:13:22.720
I just... I was taking the PSATs,

01:13:22.721 --> 01:13:25.221
and I was in a classroom
that I'd never been in before,

01:13:25.230 --> 01:13:27.350
and the teacher was giving the exam.

01:13:27.380 --> 01:13:30.100
I'd never seen her,either,and...

01:13:30.410 --> 01:13:32.720
It's,uh,it's probably nothing.

01:13:32.740 --> 01:13:35.210
Are you sure? Because maybe
I could reach Mom on the phone.

01:13:35.220 --> 01:13:37.030
We could figure something out.

01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:40.510
No,it's okay. Thanks.

01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:46.860
- Did you hear?
- What?

01:13:46.870 --> 01:13:50.170
Okay,apparently,Mr. Rutherford
has some radical stomach virus.

01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:51.290
What do you mean?

01:13:51.330 --> 01:13:53.420
He was in first period,
going on about Charlemagne,

01:13:53.421 --> 01:13:55.921
and then he just
pukes all over the place.

01:13:55.950 --> 01:13:59.770
Like,geyser-style,on his desk,
his chair,his shoes...

01:14:00.020 --> 01:14:02.130
His classroom is a biohazard.

01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:03.890
There's a note on e door that
we have to go to some room

01:14:03.891 --> 01:14:06.191
in the auxiliary
building for second period.

01:14:06.420 --> 01:14:07.860
Wait. It gets better.

01:14:07.870 --> 01:14:10.420
Some student teacher is
taking over his class for him,

01:14:10.450 --> 01:14:13.180
which probably means she'll make
the whole class into a study hall.

01:14:13.210 --> 01:14:16.730
So I'm betting we can squeeze
in another practice test.

01:14:20.420 --> 01:14:22.900
- Oh,my God.
- What?

01:14:23.380 --> 01:14:26.050
There's something
familiar about this room.

01:14:26.060 --> 01:14:29.080
Okay. Everyone,let's settle down.

01:14:36.260 --> 01:14:38.930
Please. Take a seat.

01:14:41.790 --> 01:14:44.970
As most of you probably already know,
Mr. Rutherford went home sick.

01:14:44.990 --> 01:14:46.730
My name is Ms. Snowden.

01:14:46.740 --> 01:14:49.530
I'll be your teacher until
he gets back on his feet.

01:14:49.540 --> 01:14:52.720
Authorities continue to investigate
a possible connection

01:14:52.721 --> 01:14:55.421
between slain police detective
Brad Auerbach

01:14:55.450 --> 01:14:58.850
and the recent string of serial
killings in the Phoenix area.

01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:03.190
So far,they're refusing to confirm
whether they consider Auerbach a suspect

01:15:03.220 --> 01:15:04.810
or just person of
interest in this case...

01:15:04.820 --> 01:15:07.090
Mr. Lydecker? I'm sorry.

01:15:07.100 --> 01:15:09.540
Your assistant told me
to come right in.

01:15:12.270 --> 01:15:13.950
Thank you.

01:15:16.810 --> 01:15:19.040
You left me a number of urgent messages.

01:15:19.050 --> 01:15:21.940
Sir,I'm concerned about your son.

01:15:22.670 --> 01:15:25.930
I sense that he's in
a real moment of crisis.

01:15:25.950 --> 01:15:29.470
He's consumed by
a profound sense of despair.

01:15:29.510 --> 01:15:32.620
And I'm fairly certain
he's going to attempt to hurt himself.

01:15:33.030 --> 01:15:35.640
I appreciate your concern.

01:15:35.660 --> 01:15:38.550
And I've sensed the same thing myself.

01:15:38.870 --> 01:15:41.990
Now,rest assured,he's being watched.

01:15:42.380 --> 01:15:46.190
I've reached out to a number
of mental health professionals.

01:15:46.670 --> 01:15:49.780
Truth be told,at this moment,

01:15:49.790 --> 01:15:53.360
I am less concerned about Justin's
well-being than I am with yours.

01:15:55.310 --> 01:16:00.980
Caitlyn and I have been
reviewing your log,your dreams,

01:16:01.290 --> 01:16:03.550
your impressions.

01:16:04.570 --> 01:16:07.460
I fear we may have a problem,Allison.

01:16:07.510 --> 01:16:09.260
Really? I'm sorry.

01:16:09.270 --> 01:16:13.000
The dreams you've been having about
this,uh,this police detective...

01:16:13.030 --> 01:16:14.090
the one who just died,

01:16:14.091 --> 01:16:16.891
the one that you believe is connected
to this recent spate of murders?

01:16:16.900 --> 01:16:18.550
Can I ask you about those?

01:16:18.580 --> 01:16:19.810
Please.

01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:23.470
The fact that he was slain
by a former colleague of yours

01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:25.200
the night after you dreamed

01:16:25.201 --> 01:16:28.001
that he was connected to
this horrible string of murders.

01:16:29.020 --> 01:16:32.040
I suspect that that's not a coincidence.

01:16:32.330 --> 01:16:34.900
I'm not following where you're going...

01:16:34.940 --> 01:16:37.610
Did you mention your dreams
to your colleague?

01:16:38.910 --> 01:16:41.450
Yes,I did.

01:16:44.410 --> 01:16:46.440
Okay,well,I understand
that you're new here.

01:16:46.450 --> 01:16:48.830
I understand that you're...

01:16:48.860 --> 01:16:51.350
You are still finding your footing.

01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:55.800
But I need to be completely
clear about one thing.

01:16:57.450 --> 01:17:01.880
We are paying you
an extremely large sum of money.

01:17:03.410 --> 01:17:07.870
Your thoughts,your
dreams,your impressions...

01:17:08.650 --> 01:17:11.290
they belong to Lydecker now.

01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:16.200
They are actually the intellectual
property of this company,

01:17:16.210 --> 01:17:20.860
so any attempt on your part to share those
thoughts,those dreams,those impressions,

01:17:20.900 --> 01:17:26.480
with anyone outside of this company
would actually constitute an act of theft.

01:17:28.660 --> 01:17:31.250
And I would hate
to have to prosecute you.

01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:32.670
Sir,I take your point,

01:17:32.671 --> 01:17:35.671
but the dreams that we're talking
about have nothing to do with Lydecker,

01:17:35.710 --> 01:17:38.370
and everything to do with
an open police investigation

01:17:38.380 --> 01:17:41.870
in which lives clearly
hang in the balance.

01:17:41.890 --> 01:17:44.240
Certainly,you can
appreciate that distinction.

01:17:44.270 --> 01:17:45.990
Yeah,of course I do.

01:17:46.020 --> 01:17:50.780
And I do appreciate your sense
of civic responsibility. However...

01:17:52.210 --> 01:17:55.950
If you ever breach your contract again,

01:17:55.990 --> 01:18:00.440
if you ever breach my confidence again,

01:18:00.910 --> 01:18:02.100
I will litigate you

01:18:02.101 --> 01:18:06.901
with a vigor unlike anything you have
ever experienced in your life.

01:18:08.350 --> 01:18:11.950
I will see to it that between
the cost of defending yourself

01:18:11.980 --> 01:18:14.850
and the time it takes
to mount that defense,

01:18:14.900 --> 01:18:18.030
both you and your husband
will be absolutely penniless.

01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:22.970
Your house will be gone.
Your children will have no futures.

01:18:24.140 --> 01:18:26.870
Don't misunderstand,Allison.

01:18:26.890 --> 01:18:31.590
It's my expectation that you will
work here for a very long time.

01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:35.550
Maybe the rest of your life.
I want you to be happy.

01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:42.150
I want us both to be happy.

01:19:02.370 --> 01:19:04.460
How long are you going to sit out here?

01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:06.190
Till I make sense of it.

01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:08.250
I'll get you some blankets and a pillow.

01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:11.450
How can you be so sanguine about this?

01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:13.690
Those dreams that I was sharing
with the authorities

01:19:13.691 --> 01:19:15.291
had nothing to do with Lydecker.

01:19:15.300 --> 01:19:16.170
I know that.

01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:18.420
All right.Then you tell me
how the company is affected

01:19:18.430 --> 01:19:21.560
if I help the police catch
whoever is killing these women.

01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:23.320
I can't. I don't think it would be.

01:19:23.330 --> 01:19:24.470
Exactly.

01:19:24.510 --> 01:19:27.150
Mr. Lydecker treated me like
I was some kind of traitor.

01:19:27.190 --> 01:19:29.970
Like I was sharing secrets
with his biggest competitor.

01:19:30.010 --> 01:19:33.470
I started to think that he was going
to fire me right then and there.

01:19:33.520 --> 01:19:34.490
Well,he could have.

01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:37.030
I mean,you did violate
the terms of your contract.

01:19:37.050 --> 01:19:40.200
Excuse me to help stop a murderer.

01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:42.180
But that's not his concern.

01:19:42.220 --> 01:19:44.570
That's not the business that he's in.

01:19:44.590 --> 01:19:47.990
Look,is this guy going to be
named citizen of the year? No.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.680
But... hold on a sec.
Don't jump down my throat here.

01:19:50.690 --> 01:19:52.530
He does have kind of a point.

01:19:52.580 --> 01:19:56.620
Your ideas,your thoughts are one
of the things that he's paying for.

01:19:56.650 --> 01:19:58.520
It was the same thing when
I worked at Aerodytech.

01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:01.500
Everything that I thought up
belonged to them.

01:20:01.530 --> 01:20:03.840
No,you want to talk
smic right and wrong?

01:20:03.880 --> 01:20:06.710
Yeah,you did a good
thing by calling Scanlon.

01:20:06.740 --> 01:20:08.080
And that's to your credit.

01:20:08.140 --> 01:20:09.420
But let's just say that I...

01:20:09.460 --> 01:20:13.290
I dreamed up an idea where I could
solve all the world's energy problems

01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:16.770
while I was at Aerodytech and
I brought it straight to the UN.

01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:19.950
Do you think that my employers
would have patted me on the back,

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.880
or do you think they would have
sued me for everything I had?

01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:24.930
Doesn't make sense.
None of this makes sense.

01:20:24.940 --> 01:20:27.870
Yeah,well,welcome to corporate America.

01:20:58.350 --> 01:20:59.960
Oh,God.

01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:03.850
Oh,God... Oh,God.

01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:33.390
<i>750 Wick Ave APT B</i>

01:21:43.500 --> 01:21:45.200
Justin.

01:21:45.230 --> 01:21:47.540
Oh,my God,it was Justin.
