01:12.185 --> 01:14.585
<i>My expertise is in deception.</i>

01:17.691 --> 01:21.627
The thing that sets magicians apart
from con men...

01:23.163 --> 01:25.358
...and other kinds
of thieves and liars...

01:25.532 --> 01:27.159
...is that we're honest liars.

01:27.334 --> 01:29.529
It's the moral contract.

01:29.703 --> 01:32.228
Please give it up for Jamy Ian Swiss.
Give it up!

01:32.406 --> 01:35.967
Good evening. Thank you.
Thanks a lot.

01:36.143 --> 01:40.671
We'll begin at the beginning
with incontrovertible evidence...

01:40.847 --> 01:42.212
...of a misspent youth.

01:42.382 --> 01:45.374
<i>I'm saying, "I'm gonna fool you,</i>
<i>but it's okay." Right?</i>

01:45.552 --> 01:49.921
"That's my job, and I'm gonna bring you
back in a not severely altered condition."

01:50.123 --> 01:52.887
You ever seen anybody take cards,
wave their hands...

01:53.059 --> 01:55.425
-...and have it change into another card?
-No.

01:55.629 --> 01:58.689
You wave your hands over it,
and it changes just like that.

01:58.865 --> 02:01.425
You don't always have
to wave your hands over it.

02:01.635 --> 02:05.162
Sometimes you just give it a little snap.
It changes just like that.

02:05.338 --> 02:08.273
-Watch again, just a little snap.
-No.

02:08.442 --> 02:10.568
It changes just like that.

02:11.745 --> 02:13.679
<i>I make an honest living, right?</i>

02:13.847 --> 02:15.439
<i>Therefore, it offends me...</i>

02:15.649 --> 02:19.415
...when someone takes the skills
of my honest living, if you will...

02:19.586 --> 02:22.714
...and uses it to twist and distort
and manipulate people...

02:22.889 --> 02:26.188
...and their sense of reality
and how the world works.

02:27.694 --> 02:29.184
<i>I know how to fool people...</i>

02:29.362 --> 02:32.889
<i>...and I know how to recognize</i>
<i>when people are being fooled.</i>

02:40.974 --> 02:43.465
<i>Dioxins, pesticides,</i>
<i>chemicals in general.</i>

02:45.078 --> 02:47.706
There's no evidence
that these are harming us.

02:56.423 --> 02:59.984
<i>Asbestos, designed to last a lifetime...</i>

03:00.193 --> 03:03.754
<i>...a trouble-free lifetime.</i>

03:16.142 --> 03:18.337
Catastrophic global warming is a hoax.

03:18.512 --> 03:20.446
There's no scientific consensus.

03:20.614 --> 03:22.809
There is no consensus. This is a myth.

03:31.925 --> 03:34.758
Cigarette smoking
does not cause cancer, yes or no?

03:34.928 --> 03:37.590
<i>It is not known</i>
<i>whether cigarettes cause cancer.</i>

03:37.764 --> 03:39.925
There really isn't
a scientific consensus.

03:44.371 --> 03:47.135
<i>Do you accept the basic premise</i>
<i>that smoking kills?</i>

03:48.241 --> 03:52.507
No, I think that the scientists
who make statements like that...

03:52.679 --> 03:57.116
...are making political statements,
not scientific statements.

04:37.891 --> 04:41.349
-How do you spell your name?
-G-L-A-N-T-Z.

04:41.528 --> 04:43.291
-I got it.
-I can give you a card.

04:43.430 --> 04:45.398
-No, it's all right. Stan, right?
-No?

04:45.565 --> 04:47.294
-Or Stanton. Stan.
-Are you a...?

04:47.434 --> 04:51.302
<i>I got involved in the tobacco issue</i>
<i>in 1978...</i>

04:52.672 --> 04:57.803
...over clean indoor air. Then, the radical
thing was to have a nonsmoking section.

04:57.944 --> 05:02.438
Good evening, the captain
has turned off the no-smoking sign.

05:03.416 --> 05:05.008
<i>Smoking was everywhere.</i>

05:05.185 --> 05:06.812
<i>It was on airplanes.</i>

05:06.953 --> 05:08.716
<i>It was in restaurants.</i>

05:08.888 --> 05:10.446
<i>I work in a hospital.</i>

05:10.624 --> 05:13.422
<i>People were smoking in the hospital.</i>

05:14.394 --> 05:17.852
What in the world is so wrong
about smoking in the workplace?

05:18.031 --> 05:21.262
I mean, I smoke on my job every night.
I'm not hurting anyone.

05:21.434 --> 05:24.028
-Well, that's bullshit.
-Is it?

05:24.204 --> 05:28.140
One thing you've gotta be willing to do
when you're doing science...

05:28.341 --> 05:32.072
...that is not in the interest
of these giant corporations...

05:32.245 --> 05:35.112
...when people come after you
for baloney reasons...

05:35.281 --> 05:37.772
...you've gotta be willing
to stand up to them.

05:38.418 --> 05:41.046
I don't know of any evidence,
conclusive evidence.

05:41.221 --> 05:44.054
-Here. You could read this.
-Let me ask you something.

05:44.224 --> 05:46.158
-Let me ask you something.
-Read this.

05:46.359 --> 05:50.295
Let me ask you one simple
damn question. Hold on.

05:50.463 --> 05:53.796
We spent a long time
banging our heads up against the wall...

05:53.967 --> 05:58.427
...because these guys are rich,
they're politically powerful...

05:58.605 --> 05:59.765
<i>...and they're mean.</i>

05:59.939 --> 06:01.463
-How old are you?
-I'm 42.

06:01.641 --> 06:04.974
Forty-two. Now, I smoke four packs
of cigarettes a day.

06:05.145 --> 06:07.136
I am 55.

06:07.313 --> 06:09.247
Wait a sec, wait a sec, wait a sec.

06:09.416 --> 06:13.512
Tell me if I don't look
20 years younger than this asshole.

06:13.687 --> 06:15.086
Come on.

06:16.589 --> 06:19.149
<i>But when you went to policy makers</i>
<i>or the media...</i>

06:19.325 --> 06:22.886
...and talk about just how dishonest
and manipulative they were...

06:23.029 --> 06:26.590
...people would kind of think
you were a little paranoid delusional.

06:27.600 --> 06:31.127
<i>And then the whole situation changed.</i>

06:31.304 --> 06:34.899
<i>I'm sitting in my office</i>
<i>on the 11th floor of the hospital...</i>

06:35.041 --> 06:37.134
<i>...and a box arrives.</i>

06:38.311 --> 06:41.144
<i>And in there</i>
<i>was thousands of pages...</i>

06:41.314 --> 06:45.011
<i>...of internal</i>
<i>tobacco industry documents.</i>

06:47.353 --> 06:51.016
<i>The documents in the box</i>
<i>came from somebody on the inside...</i>

06:51.191 --> 06:52.852
<i>...working for the companies...</i>

06:53.026 --> 06:55.961
<i>...copying a bunch of documents</i>
<i>and sneaking them out...</i>

06:56.129 --> 06:59.530
<i>...and making them available</i>
<i>to people on the outside.</i>

07:03.203 --> 07:05.797
<i>We now have over 80 million pages...</i>

07:05.972 --> 07:08.805
<i>...and the great bulk of those</i>
<i>have become available...</i>

07:08.975 --> 07:12.741
<i>...because of lawsuits</i>
<i>against the tobacco companies.</i>

07:13.880 --> 07:16.713
The thing that is so important
about the documents...

07:16.883 --> 07:21.217
...is it gets you behind the veil,
it gets you inside the companies...

07:21.387 --> 07:24.652
...where you don't have to speculate
about what they're doing.

07:24.824 --> 07:26.052
You could read about it.

07:27.527 --> 07:31.520
<i>That the tobacco companies knew</i>
<i>smoking caused cancer in the '50s.</i>

07:31.698 --> 07:35.259
<i>It is not known</i>
<i>whether cigarettes cause cancer.</i>

07:35.468 --> 07:38.369
<i>That they knew smoking</i>
<i>caused heart disease in the '60s.</i>

07:39.739 --> 07:43.231
<i>No causal relationship between</i>
<i>cigarette smoking and heart disease?</i>

07:43.409 --> 07:45.240
<i>No, as a matter of fact there are</i>--

07:45.411 --> 07:48.403
<i>That they knew nicotine</i>
<i>was an addictive drug in the '60s.</i>

07:51.351 --> 07:55.845
<i>Yet 30 years later, the CEOs</i>
<i>of all the big tobacco companies...</i>

07:56.022 --> 08:01.619
<i>...stood up under oath and told Congress</i>
<i>that nicotine wasn't addictive.</i>

08:01.795 --> 08:06.095
-<i>You believe nicotine is not addictive?</i>
-<i>I believe nicotine is not addictive, yes.</i>

08:06.266 --> 08:08.757
<i>I don't believe our products</i>
<i>are addictive.</i>

08:08.935 --> 08:10.562
-<i>Not addictive.</i>
-<i>Not addictive.</i>

08:10.737 --> 08:13.001
-<i>It's not addictive.</i>
-<i>Not addictive.</i>

08:18.211 --> 08:22.910
<i>The science that they did internally</i>
<i>was very good, often decades ahead...</i>

08:23.082 --> 08:26.074
<i>...of what people on the outside</i>
<i>were doing.</i>

08:26.252 --> 08:29.244
<i>It's just that you don't want the people</i>
<i>on the outside...</i>

08:29.422 --> 08:31.515
<i>...to know</i>
<i>what that evidence is saying.</i>

08:33.259 --> 08:38.162
<i>The tobacco issue broke</i>
<i>into the public consciousness in 1953.</i>

08:38.731 --> 08:43.429
<i>Faced with undeniable evidence</i>
<i>that smoking was killing people...</i>

08:43.602 --> 08:47.903
...they did what any self-respecting
big corporation would do.

08:48.074 --> 08:50.406
They hired a public relations firm.

08:56.115 --> 08:59.949
<i>And Hill and Knowlton said to the heads</i>
<i>of all the big tobacco companies:</i>

09:00.119 --> 09:01.814
<i>"You can't deny the evidence.</i>

09:01.988 --> 09:05.253
You can't say smoking
doesn't cause cancer.

09:05.925 --> 09:09.326
<i>But what you can do is cast doubt."</i>

09:15.969 --> 09:20.702
<i>I think there's a great deal of doubt as</i>
<i>to whether or not cigarettes are harmful.</i>

09:20.874 --> 09:22.967
<i>Smoking may be hazardous,</i>
<i>it may not be.</i>

09:23.142 --> 09:25.269
<i>Smoking may be hazardous,</i>
<i>it may not be.</i>

09:25.445 --> 09:28.175
<i>It may be or it may not be.</i>
<i>We don't know.</i>

09:28.348 --> 09:31.476
None of the things which have
been found in tobacco smoke...

09:33.152 --> 09:36.144
...are at concentrations
which can be considered harmful.

09:36.322 --> 09:41.089
But the components themselves
can be considered harmful, can they not?

09:41.227 --> 09:43.457
Anything can be considered harmful.

09:43.630 --> 09:47.623
Applesauce is harmful
if you get too much of it.

09:47.800 --> 09:50.496
I don't think many people
are dying from applesauce.

09:50.670 --> 09:52.797
They're not eating that much.

09:54.974 --> 09:58.102
<i>The playbook that big tobacco</i>
<i>developed to attack science...</i>

09:59.913 --> 10:01.608
<i>...worked for them for 50 years.</i>

10:03.216 --> 10:08.711
<i>Because every day that they can delay</i>
<i>effective policy action...</i>

10:08.888 --> 10:12.688
<i>...is one more day</i>
<i>that they can make more money.</i>

10:14.193 --> 10:16.354
<i>They can be out there</i>
<i>selling a product...</i>

10:16.529 --> 10:21.159
<i>...that's killing a half-a-million Americans</i>
<i>a year and get away with it.</i>

10:21.334 --> 10:25.498
And so other businesses that were faced
with regulatory challenges...

10:25.672 --> 10:29.631
...had to look at this and say,
"Boy, if this works for tobacco...

10:29.776 --> 10:32.574
...we ought to be able
to use that playbook too."

10:36.282 --> 10:40.582
<i>What's happened is that people working</i>
<i>on a whole range of other issues...</i>

10:40.753 --> 10:43.745
<i>...that you wouldn't think had much</i>
<i>to do with tobacco...</i>

10:43.923 --> 10:46.585
<i>...have gone into the documents</i>
<i>and found things...</i>

10:46.759 --> 10:49.660
<i>...that we never would have thought</i>
<i>to have looked for.</i>

11:06.079 --> 11:08.104
<i>My partner and I,</i>
<i>we were both ready...</i>

11:08.281 --> 11:11.808
...to take on a new project,
something we could sink our teeth into.

11:13.219 --> 11:14.584
And almost everybody said:

11:16.322 --> 11:18.756
"You should be looking
at flame retardants."

11:20.259 --> 11:24.423
<i>I had no idea that there were flame</i>
<i>retardants in my couches, my chairs.</i>

11:26.099 --> 11:28.932
These are chemicals measured
by ounces and pounds.

11:29.102 --> 11:34.130
In the average couch, there could be
up to 2 pounds of flame retardants.

11:34.307 --> 11:37.572
<i>We all wind up with the chemicals</i>
<i>in our bodies because of it.</i>

11:37.744 --> 11:41.840
<i>Because those chemicals come out</i>
<i>of the foam, they migrate in the dust.</i>

11:42.348 --> 11:45.112
<i>American babies are born</i>
<i>with the highest levels...</i>

11:45.284 --> 11:48.276
<i>...of flame retardant chemicals</i>
<i>of any place in the world.</i>

11:49.655 --> 11:51.452
<i>They're linked to health problems.</i>

11:53.359 --> 11:55.589
And kids are the most vulnerable.

11:56.596 --> 12:01.363
<i>So then the big question was,</i>
<i>"Do they really protect us from fires?"</i>

12:01.534 --> 12:03.661
<i>One of the early breakthroughs was...</i>

12:03.836 --> 12:06.862
...when we talked
to the leading fire scientist.

12:07.040 --> 12:11.477
<i>It was his study that the chemical</i>
<i>industry was holding up as proof...</i>

12:11.644 --> 12:14.044
<i>...that flame retardants work.</i>

12:15.048 --> 12:19.815
<i>And yet when we talked to him, he said,</i>
<i>"They're grossly distorting my work."</i>

12:19.986 --> 12:23.649
<i>That flame retardants in your house...</i>

12:23.823 --> 12:26.451
<i>...they don't protect you from anything.</i>

12:26.959 --> 12:29.154
And then I thought, "Wow, okay.

12:29.328 --> 12:32.855
We have them in our bodies,
they're rising exponentially...

12:33.032 --> 12:35.296
...and they don't work?

12:35.468 --> 12:36.662
How can that be?"

12:39.272 --> 12:45.541
<i>In the '70s, thousands of people</i>
<i>were dying in fires started by cigarettes.</i>

12:45.711 --> 12:48.179
<i>When you smoked a cigarette</i>
<i>and put it down...</i>

12:48.347 --> 12:52.511
<i>...it could burn for up to 30 minutes</i>
<i>after you'd put it down.</i>

12:53.219 --> 12:55.414
<i>The tobacco industry</i>
<i>was under pressure...</i>

12:55.588 --> 12:58.557
<i>...to create</i>
<i>a self-extinguishing cigarette.</i>

12:58.724 --> 13:01.852
Tobacco kept insisting,
"We can't do it."

13:02.428 --> 13:04.487
You start tampering
with a cigarette...

13:04.664 --> 13:09.033
...it is a very highly technical
and complex undertaking.

13:09.202 --> 13:11.227
<i>They didn't want to alter a product...</i>

13:11.404 --> 13:15.363
<i>...that was making them</i>
<i>billions of dollars a year.</i>

13:15.541 --> 13:17.441
So what they needed
was a scapegoat.

13:17.610 --> 13:20.807
And they had this perfect scapegoat,
and it was furniture.

13:20.947 --> 13:22.710
<i>The furniture was to blame here.</i>

13:22.882 --> 13:27.012
<i>You need to fireproof the world</i>
<i>around the cigarette.</i>

13:27.186 --> 13:30.849
The cigarette industry at that time
was having credibility problems...

13:31.023 --> 13:36.051
...so they needed a credible third party
to go out there and deliver their message.

13:38.264 --> 13:40.858
<i>There was this document</i>
<i>in the tobacco archives...</i>

13:41.033 --> 13:45.094
<i>...that laid bare their strategy</i>
<i>in pretty callous language.</i>

13:45.271 --> 13:49.332
<i>"You have to try to understand</i>
<i>who is a potential threat to you...</i>

13:49.475 --> 13:51.409
...so you can neutralize them.

13:51.577 --> 13:54.910
Example,
the self-extinguishing cigarette.

13:55.081 --> 13:58.209
Who would be involved
in the self-extinguishing cigarette...

13:58.384 --> 14:01.911
...on the other side of the fence?
The firefighting community."

14:02.088 --> 14:04.420
This is an international group
of executives.

14:04.590 --> 14:06.751
He's saying,
"This is what you need to do.

14:06.926 --> 14:09.451
Find your enemies.
In this case the fire service.

14:09.629 --> 14:12.723
Those folks are a real threat to us.
Neutralize them."

14:14.667 --> 14:16.931
<i>"We had turned them around</i>
<i>and made allies.</i>

14:17.103 --> 14:20.595
<i>Third-party defenders for ourselves."</i>

14:22.241 --> 14:27.235
<i>So there was a guy at the Tobacco</i>
<i>Institute named Peter Sparber.</i>

14:27.413 --> 14:30.314
<i>The Tobacco Institute</i>
<i>planted Peter Sparber...</i>

14:30.483 --> 14:34.749
<i>...inside the National Association</i>
<i>of State Fire Marshals.</i>

14:37.657 --> 14:42.287
<i>And the fire marshals named him</i>
<i>their legislative representative.</i>

14:44.697 --> 14:47.791
<i>What the fire marshals didn't know</i>
<i>was that big tobacco...</i>

14:47.967 --> 14:52.495
<i>...was paying him $200 an hour for work</i>
<i>they thought was volunteer work.</i>

14:53.906 --> 14:55.999
So in some ways
he's almost like a spy.

14:56.175 --> 14:58.973
He would go in,
he would talk to the fire marshals.

14:59.145 --> 15:04.549
And he convinced them that they should
deliver the message of big tobacco.

15:05.184 --> 15:09.120
<i>That it's not cigarettes causing</i>
<i>all these fatal fires, it's the furniture.</i>

15:12.992 --> 15:15.859
<i>Manufacturers had to put pounds</i>
<i>of toxic chemicals...</i>

15:16.028 --> 15:17.859
<i>...into the cushions of your couch.</i>

15:19.632 --> 15:21.566
You have to hand it
to Peter Sparber.

15:21.734 --> 15:25.033
I don't think there's too many guys
that could pull that off.

15:25.204 --> 15:28.469
<i>He said, "If you can do tobacco...</i>

15:28.641 --> 15:32.509
<i>...you can do just about anything</i>
<i>in public relations."</i>

15:33.246 --> 15:38.081
<i>Peter Sparber went on to work</i>
<i>for the pesticide industry, the oil industry.</i>

15:38.251 --> 15:40.719
<i>There are other Peter Sparbers</i>
<i>out there.</i>

15:41.687 --> 15:46.590
<i>You see the same small group of people</i>
<i>that the tobacco industry used...</i>

15:46.759 --> 15:48.989
<i>...working on all kinds of other issues.</i>

15:49.161 --> 15:51.823
This is not what the drunk driving debate
is about.

15:51.998 --> 15:55.024
This is political sound bites
instead of good science.

15:55.201 --> 15:57.965
<i>They had developed</i>
<i>a certain set of skills...</i>

15:58.104 --> 16:00.766
<i>...that a lot of industries</i>
<i>are gonna want.</i>

16:00.973 --> 16:03.601
Dioxins, pesticides,
chemicals in general.

16:03.776 --> 16:06.176
There's no evidence
that these are harming us.

16:06.345 --> 16:09.178
<i>The only way these guys</i>
<i>are actually effective...</i>

16:09.348 --> 16:12.840
<i>...is if the public thinks</i>
<i>they're an independent voice.</i>

16:13.019 --> 16:15.749
Steve, first of all,
are you in bed with big oil...

16:15.921 --> 16:18.856
...and if so, how good in bed are they?

16:19.025 --> 16:23.587
Not in bed with anyone, just trying
to do the right thing on climate change.

16:33.572 --> 16:34.273
Red. Watch it. You win. You lose.

16:34.273 --> 16:35.934
Red. Watch it. You win. You lose.

16:36.108 --> 16:38.303
You lose. See.

16:40.379 --> 16:42.142
How did you miss that one?

16:42.315 --> 16:44.943
Nobody ever won
at Three-Card Monte in history.

16:45.117 --> 16:48.086
They've been playing it for 150 years,
and nobody's won.

16:48.254 --> 16:50.449
That one's your red.
That one's your black.

16:52.024 --> 16:54.549
<i>People want to think</i>
<i>that the Three-Card Monte...</i>

16:54.727 --> 16:58.458
<i>...is all about the sleight-of-hand</i>
<i>maneuver the Monte operator uses...</i>

16:58.631 --> 17:00.963
...to switch one card for another.

17:01.133 --> 17:02.327
That's the least of it.

17:03.936 --> 17:07.337
<i>The Monte operator, he wants</i>
<i>to instill that confidence in you.</i>

17:07.540 --> 17:09.906
That's where "con" comes
in con game.

17:10.076 --> 17:13.944
<i>And so he enlists</i>
<i>the assistance of confederates...</i>

17:14.113 --> 17:18.413
...shills, people who stand there
and bet with money and watch the game.

17:19.819 --> 17:22.413
<i>The shill wins so that you have</i>
<i>the confidence...</i>

17:22.588 --> 17:24.579
...that the Monte operator will pay.

17:24.757 --> 17:27.851
Pay me. Thank you. Thank you.

17:29.295 --> 17:32.162
<i>They're gonna look</i>
<i>like they're independent.</i>

17:32.331 --> 17:34.629
<i>The idea of how to mask the shill...</i>

17:34.800 --> 17:37.860
...how to make the shill
look legitimate to the audience...

17:38.070 --> 17:41.335
...so that they're not suspect
when they're playing the game...

17:41.507 --> 17:43.270
<i>...is all part of the psychology.</i>

17:43.442 --> 17:46.605
<i>The game does not work</i>
<i>without that concealment.</i>

17:50.883 --> 17:53.317
<i>The evidence does not support</i>
<i>the notion...</i>

17:53.486 --> 17:55.647
<i>...that humans are causing</i>
<i>global warming.</i>

17:55.821 --> 17:57.982
<i>There is no scientific basis for alarm.</i>

17:58.157 --> 18:01.183
<i>We do not know enough</i>
<i>about what affects climate.</i>

18:01.360 --> 18:03.191
<i>We don't know if there's a problem.</i>

18:03.362 --> 18:05.694
<i>Climate scientists</i>
<i>have a political agenda...</i>

18:05.865 --> 18:10.097
<i>...and they are using science</i>
<i>to drive that political agenda.</i>

18:17.042 --> 18:21.536
First of all, Dr. Hansen, say your name,
spell your last name, give your title.

18:21.714 --> 18:23.306
Well, I'm James Hansen.

18:23.482 --> 18:27.612
I'm the head of the Goddard Institute
for Space Studies. And it's H-A-N-S-E-N.

18:27.753 --> 18:28.879
Okay.

18:30.723 --> 18:32.657
You've created quite a stir.

18:32.825 --> 18:36.352
Are you glad that the stir is happening?

18:36.529 --> 18:39.521
Well, I think that it's important
to have the attention...

18:39.698 --> 18:42.758
...on the possible climate changes.

18:43.669 --> 18:45.899
-Let's try that again.
-Sure.

18:46.071 --> 18:47.902
-You want to ask the question?
-No.

18:48.073 --> 18:50.633
No, you just go ahead
and answer them.

18:50.776 --> 18:56.737
Well, I think that--
What I'd like to say is that, frankly...

18:56.916 --> 19:01.376
...I would rather do my research
than be interviewed for TV.

19:05.691 --> 19:09.388
<i>What made you fall in love</i>
<i>with science?</i>

19:09.562 --> 19:11.189
<i>Well, that's what I could do.</i>

19:11.363 --> 19:14.423
I could do physics and mathematics.
That was easy for me.

19:17.169 --> 19:19.797
<i>I got into science with NASA...</i>

19:19.972 --> 19:22.566
<i>...as the space program</i>
<i>was just getting started.</i>

19:22.741 --> 19:27.542
<i>I had proposed an experiment to go</i>
<i>to Venus on the Pioneer Venus mission.</i>

19:27.713 --> 19:32.707
<i>The question was,</i>
<i>"Well, why was Venus so hot?"</i>

19:32.885 --> 19:36.412
<i>As it turned out, the greenhouse effect</i>
<i>was the reason...</i>

19:36.589 --> 19:41.549
<i>...why Venus had a temperature</i>
<i>of about 600 degrees.</i>

19:44.330 --> 19:49.199
<i>We started realizing</i>
<i>that our own atmosphere was changing.</i>

19:49.335 --> 19:52.634
So I then began to work full-time...

19:52.805 --> 19:57.208
...on understanding our planet
instead of Venus.

19:59.445 --> 20:03.006
<i>The CO2 that we put in the air</i>
<i>by burning fossil fuels...</i>

20:03.215 --> 20:06.776
<i>...will stay in the climate system</i>
<i>for millennia.</i>

20:08.120 --> 20:11.112
<i>It's like putting a blanket</i>
<i>around the planet.</i>

20:11.290 --> 20:12.723
<i>It holds in the heat.</i>

20:16.262 --> 20:19.595
<i>Civilization has developed</i>
<i>in the last several thousand years...</i>

20:19.765 --> 20:22.325
<i>...in a climate</i>
<i>that has been very stable...</i>

20:22.501 --> 20:26.665
<i>...varying by no more</i>
<i>than about one degree.</i>

20:27.239 --> 20:29.366
<i>So if you warm up a few degrees...</i>

20:29.542 --> 20:34.138
<i>...you're putting the planet</i>
<i>outside that which has existed...</i>

20:34.313 --> 20:37.544
<i>...for hundreds of thousands of years.</i>

20:41.387 --> 20:46.324
We'd just assumed that humanity
would take sensible actions...

20:46.492 --> 20:50.189
...to avoid undesirable consequences.

20:50.362 --> 20:51.989
Thank you for being here.

20:52.164 --> 20:55.463
Dr. Hansen, if you'd start us off,
we'd appreciate it.

20:55.968 --> 20:57.697
Mr. Chairman and members--

20:57.870 --> 21:00.270
You have to talk
right into the microphone.

21:00.406 --> 21:02.806
These are not high-tech microphones.

21:02.975 --> 21:07.344
You have to pull it right over close
and talk right into it or people can't hear.

21:07.513 --> 21:09.037
-Okay.
-There you go.

21:09.214 --> 21:12.650
<i>Most scientists</i>
<i>are not good communicators.</i>

21:12.818 --> 21:14.308
We're not trained to do that.

21:14.486 --> 21:16.317
Science itself is hard enough...

21:16.488 --> 21:21.585
...without trying to communicate
with the public.

21:21.794 --> 21:24.058
The global warming
is now large enough...

21:24.229 --> 21:27.392
...that we can ascribe
with a high degree of confidence...

21:27.566 --> 21:31.832
...a cause-and-effect relationship
to the greenhouse effect.

21:32.004 --> 21:37.533
<i>So in 1988, Jim Hansen testifies,</i>
<i>and the news media reports it.</i>

21:39.378 --> 21:42.040
It could mean devastating changes
to life on Earth.

21:42.214 --> 21:45.115
John Passacantando,
executive director of Greenpeace.

21:46.518 --> 21:48.543
I just trundled into this fight...

21:48.721 --> 21:51.952
...as really just another
earnest environmentalist.

21:54.126 --> 21:56.617
<i>I've worked on this for 20 years.</i>

21:56.829 --> 22:01.391
<i>Environmentalists, we thought</i>
<i>this was a fight about science.</i>

22:01.567 --> 22:04.035
Get the science out there,
into the media...

22:04.203 --> 22:06.569
...politicians will listen,
we can solve this.

22:06.739 --> 22:09.572
The question is,
what will the White House do about it?

22:09.742 --> 22:13.974
Politicians, even President Bush,
say, "We're gonna tackle this."

22:14.146 --> 22:16.740
Those who think we're powerless
with this greenhouse effect...

22:18.150 --> 22:20.641
...are forgetting
about the White House effect.

22:21.286 --> 22:25.746
So the fossil fuel industry realizes
it has an enormous problem.

22:25.924 --> 22:29.951
Bill O'Keefe is executive vice president
of the American Petroleum Institute.

22:30.129 --> 22:33.223
He's also a board member
of the Global Climate Coalition...

22:33.399 --> 22:37.301
...made up of oil and electric companies,
automakers and others.

22:37.469 --> 22:40.905
We believed it was a war on oil,
they had an off-oil agenda.

22:42.675 --> 22:44.438
Climate change was part of that.

22:44.610 --> 22:47.602
I think that it's unfortunate
that the science...

22:47.780 --> 22:49.771
...is so distorted and misstated....

22:49.948 --> 22:53.406
The science is complicated,
and there are lots of factors.

22:53.585 --> 22:55.815
You have to understand
the whole picture.

22:55.988 --> 22:59.583
There is a natural variability
that has nothing to do with man.

22:59.792 --> 23:01.419
Climate is changing naturally.

23:01.593 --> 23:05.427
It has to do with sunspots,
the wobble of the Earth.

23:05.597 --> 23:08.031
<i>And so it's not too difficult...</i>

23:08.200 --> 23:12.466
...to persuade some of the public
that we really don't know for sure.

23:12.638 --> 23:15.436
So let's wait awhile.
We need to have more proof.

23:15.607 --> 23:17.472
We need more data.

23:17.643 --> 23:20.203
The science isn't there
to make a determination.

23:20.412 --> 23:24.007
There is no need for us to rush
to this kind of judgment....

23:24.183 --> 23:28.677
Others put out ads saying
more pollution is gonna be good for us.

23:28.854 --> 23:31.288
A doubling of the CO2
in the atmosphere...

23:31.457 --> 23:34.449
...will produce a tremendous greening
of Planet Earth.

23:34.626 --> 23:36.025
CO2 benefits plant life.

23:36.195 --> 23:39.028
It's increasing
the bounty of the planet...

23:39.198 --> 23:41.496
...our ability to feed populations.

23:41.667 --> 23:43.726
What you see
from the coal industry...

23:43.936 --> 23:46.837
...is analogous to what
the tobacco industry used to do.

23:47.005 --> 23:50.964
They refuse to change. They're trying
to convince us that it's good for us.

23:51.143 --> 23:54.806
The way they used to say,
"Luckys make you healthy."

23:54.980 --> 23:59.679
So there's this hope that,
as the science continues to emerge...

23:59.852 --> 24:02.013
...the public will become aware...

24:02.187 --> 24:05.850
...and our political leaders
will solve this problem.

24:06.024 --> 24:08.219
But that's not what happened.

24:20.672 --> 24:24.699
<i>I was always interested in broader</i>
<i>questions about scientific knowledge.</i>

24:24.877 --> 24:27.038
<i>Why we believe some things</i>
<i>and not others.</i>

24:27.212 --> 24:29.043
<i>How do scientists come</i>
<i>to consensus?</i>

24:29.214 --> 24:32.843
What does it take for scientists to say,
"Yes, we know this is true"?

24:33.018 --> 24:36.044
The problem is, there's no consensus
on what's causing it.

24:36.221 --> 24:38.883
Consensus has not been met
among scientists....

24:39.057 --> 24:41.753
<i>A decade after Hansen</i>
<i>had testified in Congress...</i>

24:41.927 --> 24:43.918
<i>...that climate change</i>
<i>was happening...</i>

24:44.096 --> 24:47.554
<i>...the media are still presenting this</i>
<i>as a big scientific debate.</i>

24:47.733 --> 24:52.033
Gentlemen, I'm sure that this debate
is gonna continue for a long, long time.

24:52.204 --> 24:54.764
I had the idea
that we could test this question...

24:54.940 --> 24:58.137
...of whether or not there was
a consensus among scientists.

24:58.310 --> 25:01.006
Active scientists,
people who are doing research...

25:01.146 --> 25:02.738
...and publishing in journals.

25:02.915 --> 25:05.907
Not the public at large,
not politicians, but scientists.

25:09.621 --> 25:12.784
<i>And so we got a list</i>
<i>of all of the papers...</i>

25:12.958 --> 25:16.951
<i>...that had been published</i>
<i>from 1992 to 2002...</i>

25:17.129 --> 25:20.621
<i>...that had used that key word phrase</i>
<i>"global climate change."</i>

25:20.799 --> 25:22.528
And then we read them.

25:22.668 --> 25:24.295
<i>The question was...</i>

25:24.469 --> 25:29.406
<i>...how many of these papers disagree</i>
<i>that most of the observed warming...</i>

25:29.575 --> 25:33.739
<i>...is due to the increase</i>
<i>in greenhouse gas concentrations?</i>

25:34.479 --> 25:38.347
<i>So I certainly thought</i>
<i>we would get some that disagreed.</i>

25:40.185 --> 25:41.948
<i>And when we found nothing...</i>

25:42.120 --> 25:46.147
...then I thought, "Oh, this is a result
that needs to be published."

25:47.259 --> 25:50.194
<i>When my article</i>
<i>on the scientific consensus came out...</i>

25:50.362 --> 25:54.298
<i>...I started getting threatening e-mails,</i>
<i>saying that I was a communist...</i>

25:54.466 --> 25:57.264
<i>...that I should be fired from my job.</i>

25:59.972 --> 26:01.769
<i>A few people began to say to me:</i>

26:01.940 --> 26:05.637
<i>"Other people have also been attacked</i>
<i>in a way that seems similar."</i>

26:05.811 --> 26:09.076
People who worked on acid rain,
who worked on the ozone hole.

26:11.350 --> 26:14.513
<i>I started doing research on the people</i>
<i>who were attacking me.</i>

26:15.487 --> 26:18.115
<i>And that's when I discovered</i>
<i>a startling fact.</i>

26:18.290 --> 26:20.121
<i>They were the same people...</i>

26:20.292 --> 26:23.227
<i>...who had attacked the scientists</i>
<i>on all these issues.</i>

26:24.997 --> 26:29.331
Then I began to realize, "This is a debate,
but this is not a scientific debate."

26:29.501 --> 26:32.527
And if it's not scientific,
then the question becomes:

26:32.704 --> 26:35.673
"Well, what sort of a debate is it?"

26:51.823 --> 26:54.314
<i>Dr. Fred Singer was greeted</i>
<i>like a rock star...</i>

26:54.493 --> 26:57.053
<i>...at a recent meeting</i>
<i>of global warming skeptics.</i>

26:57.229 --> 27:00.062
<i>This 84-year-old,</i>
<i>Princeton-trained physicist...</i>

27:00.232 --> 27:02.200
<i>...is the grandfather</i>
<i>of a movement...</i>

27:02.367 --> 27:05.427
<i>...that rails against</i>
<i>the broad scientific understanding...</i>

27:05.637 --> 27:10.665
<i>...that global warming is real,</i>
<i>man-made and potentially catastrophic.</i>

27:10.842 --> 27:13.367
It's all bunk. It's all bunk.

27:13.545 --> 27:16.708
There are so many scientists
who disagree with you.

27:16.882 --> 27:20.340
The IPCC, NASA, NOAA,
the National Academy of Sciences...

27:20.519 --> 27:23.511
...American Association
for the Advancement of Science...

27:23.689 --> 27:27.352
...The American Geophysical Union,
The American Meteorological Society.

27:27.526 --> 27:30.427
We're talking about scientists
all over the globe.

27:30.595 --> 27:32.586
What can I say? They're wrong.

27:32.764 --> 27:37.098
When we talk about scientists,
there are really two camps.

27:37.269 --> 27:41.729
Those of us who wish to have decisions
that are evidence-based...

27:43.408 --> 27:47.674
...are called, not just skeptics,
which is a good word...

27:47.813 --> 27:49.906
...but they're called deniers.

27:50.082 --> 27:52.573
And some of us are called criminals.

27:52.751 --> 27:54.275
What would you call yourself?

27:54.453 --> 27:59.447
Well, I consider myself,
primarily, a scientist.

28:00.993 --> 28:03.291
<i>A major part of the mystery</i>
<i>of this story...</i>

28:03.462 --> 28:06.920
<i>...was to understand</i>
<i>the scientists in the story.</i>

28:07.099 --> 28:10.466
This whole thing doesn't work
unless there are credible voices.

28:12.070 --> 28:14.937
<i>Eminent scientists,</i>
<i>Drs. Singer and Seitz...</i>

28:15.107 --> 28:17.473
<i>...promote the skeptic view</i>
<i>on climate change.</i>

28:19.077 --> 28:22.513
<i>Singer and Seitz rose to high positions</i>
<i>of influence and power...</i>

28:22.714 --> 28:25.911
<i>...within the American</i>
<i>scientific establishment.</i>

28:27.085 --> 28:31.818
<i>Fred Seitz was one of the most important</i>
<i>American physicists of the 20th century.</i>

28:31.990 --> 28:35.653
<i>He was the president of the U.S.</i>
<i>National Academy of Sciences.</i>

28:35.827 --> 28:39.228
<i>But now we see him starting</i>
<i>to attack science and scientists...</i>

28:39.364 --> 28:42.128
<i>...in areas</i>
<i>in which he has no expertise.</i>

28:42.934 --> 28:47.098
So why would a man like that question
the work of his own scientific colleagues?

28:48.273 --> 28:51.106
<i>One of the other things</i>
<i>that emerged was that Seitz...</i>

28:51.276 --> 28:54.803
<i>...had worked for the R.J. Reynolds</i>
<i>Tobacco Company.</i>

28:56.381 --> 28:59.509
The blame for smoking
should be placed upon smokers.

29:01.386 --> 29:04.651
If they buy them,
it's their responsibility.

29:04.823 --> 29:06.814
Yeah, but you know
that in the '80s...

29:06.992 --> 29:11.452
...the tobacco company very clearly
said that there wasn't a direct linkage.

29:11.630 --> 29:15.623
If people wanted to believe that,
it was their own doing.

29:15.801 --> 29:19.259
But was that also political on the part
of the tobacco companies?

29:19.404 --> 29:22.032
-Well, they wanted to keep up sales.
-Yeah.

29:22.207 --> 29:25.768
Was it irresponsible on the part
of the tobacco companies?

29:27.879 --> 29:31.315
It was irresponsible
on the part of the smokers.

29:33.418 --> 29:37.377
<i>Fred Singer, like Fred Seitz,</i>
<i>also worked with the tobacco industry.</i>

29:37.556 --> 29:42.357
<i>You can find many documents that attest</i>
<i>to his relationship with Philip Morris.</i>

29:42.527 --> 29:46.327
I still think that the EPA has cooked
the data on secondhand smoke.

29:46.498 --> 29:51.094
I am annoyed by the fact
that this tobacco business...

29:51.303 --> 29:57.105
...comes up every time
when I speak about global warming...

29:57.309 --> 29:59.402
...which has nothing to do
with tobacco.

30:00.078 --> 30:02.103
<i>So why did Seitz and Singer do this?</i>

30:02.314 --> 30:05.374
<i>Why would they make common cause</i>
<i>with the tobacco industry?</i>

30:05.550 --> 30:07.882
<i>Most people assume</i>
<i>the answer's money.</i>

30:08.053 --> 30:11.545
But it was clear to me early on
that that wasn't the whole story.

30:11.723 --> 30:12.815
<i>Lift off.</i>

30:13.558 --> 30:16.254
<i>Lift off at 34 minutes....</i>

30:16.428 --> 30:19.192
<i>Both Seitz and Singer</i>
<i>are Cold War scientists.</i>

30:19.364 --> 30:23.130
<i>They both worked on Cold War</i>
<i>weapons and rocketry programs.</i>

30:23.335 --> 30:26.429
<i>I was primarily concerned</i>
<i>with building instrumentation...</i>

30:26.605 --> 30:29.699
...to be put into captured V2 rockets.

30:30.609 --> 30:34.705
<i>We felt the threat</i>
<i>of the Soviet Union quite strongly.</i>

30:34.880 --> 30:39.078
They also shared a kind of political
ideology, deeply, deeply anti-communist.

30:39.885 --> 30:41.546
<i>When the Cold War ends...</i>

30:41.720 --> 30:46.714
<i>...they begin systematically attacking</i>
<i>all these other issues.</i>

30:47.292 --> 30:51.160
<i>There's a bit of a mystery. What do</i>
<i>these things all have in common?</i>

30:51.730 --> 30:54.893
<i>All of these issues are issues</i>
<i>that involve...</i>

30:55.066 --> 30:57.500
<i>...the need for government action.</i>

30:57.669 --> 30:59.261
<i>That's when the penny dropped.</i>

30:59.437 --> 31:02.429
<i>I began to realize,</i>
<i>none of this is about the science.</i>

31:03.909 --> 31:06.969
This is a political debate
about the role of government.

31:07.879 --> 31:10.939
<i>So in a number of places,</i>
<i>we found these people saying...</i>

31:11.116 --> 31:13.880
<i>...they see environmentalists</i>
<i>as creeping communists.</i>

31:14.019 --> 31:17.011
They're Reds under the bed,
they call them watermelons...

31:17.189 --> 31:19.180
...Green on the outside,
Red inside...

31:19.391 --> 31:21.951
...and they worry
that environmental regulation...

31:22.127 --> 31:24.118
...is a slippery slope to socialism.

31:24.296 --> 31:29.165
Socialism will not be buried
under the ruins of the Berlin Wall.

31:30.302 --> 31:32.270
<i>We're not seeing</i>
<i>the end of communism.</i>

31:32.437 --> 31:37.773
<i>But the beginning of a new threat to free</i>
<i>enterprise and to liberal democracies.</i>

31:38.410 --> 31:39.809
<i>By any other name...</i>

31:39.978 --> 31:45.041
<i>...government control of the economy is</i>
<i>still government control of the economy.</i>

31:51.223 --> 31:52.622
I call them watermelons.

31:52.791 --> 31:55.692
They're Green on the outside,
but Red on the inside.

32:01.032 --> 32:03.500
<i>You know,</i>
<i>at the end of the Cold War...</i>

32:03.668 --> 32:06.034
...we threw these people
out the window Red...

32:06.204 --> 32:09.196
...and now they've walked
back in the front door Green.

32:10.242 --> 32:13.643
I'll tell you what the environmental
movement is in this country.

32:13.812 --> 32:16.337
It is the modern home...

32:16.514 --> 32:21.508
...of the socialist-slash-communist
movement in America.

32:26.024 --> 32:31.360
This bill is Green on the outside
and inside it's deep communist Red.

32:47.345 --> 32:51.042
<i>The further down the road somebody</i>
<i>gets in terms of their commitment...</i>

32:51.216 --> 32:54.617
...behaviorally and ideologically
with a social group, a tribe--

32:56.221 --> 32:58.985
"Our tribe doubts climate change.
That's what we do."

32:59.124 --> 33:02.184
Whether you care or not,
your tribe believes a bunch...

33:02.360 --> 33:06.091
...of other things that you also believe,
so you buy the package.

33:08.933 --> 33:12.528
I am Michael Shermer,
director of The Skeptic Society.

33:12.704 --> 33:15.298
We investigate the paranormal,
pseudoscience...

33:15.507 --> 33:18.032
...and cults and claims
of all kinds between.

33:18.209 --> 33:20.268
<i>Some people call us debunkers...</i>

33:20.445 --> 33:24.745
...but there's a lot of bunk that needs
debunking and that's part of our job.

33:24.916 --> 33:28.079
When I say, "Where's the spacecraft?"
You say, "They hid it."

33:28.253 --> 33:30.278
Your whole case is based
on anecdotes.

33:30.455 --> 33:34.118
You gotta have a piece of the spacecraft,
as I've always said.

33:34.292 --> 33:36.419
Bring back one of those probes.

33:36.594 --> 33:38.425
We did one on Holocaust deniers.

33:38.596 --> 33:41.121
Vaccinations,
"Do Vaccines Cause Autism?"

33:41.299 --> 33:43.665
We've done many issues
on climate change.

33:43.835 --> 33:46.531
<i>I became skeptical</i>
<i>of the environmental movement...</i>

33:46.671 --> 33:49.640
...when a lot of the predictions
they made in the '70s--

33:49.808 --> 33:53.107
When I was in college
and taking classes in these subjects.

33:53.278 --> 33:56.270
--it was clear they weren't coming true.
They exaggerated.

34:01.286 --> 34:04.084
Sometime in the next 15 years,
the end will come.

34:04.255 --> 34:07.918
An utter breakdown of the capacity
of the planet to support humanity.

34:08.092 --> 34:10.789
And when civilization collapses
on this earth...

34:10.962 --> 34:15.422
...as it will within this decade,
it's going to hit the U.S. first.

34:17.068 --> 34:20.868
<i>Rain forests would disappear</i>
<i>and we'd run out of oil, and all that.</i>

34:21.072 --> 34:23.130
<i>Overpopulation will destroy the Earth.</i>

34:23.308 --> 34:26.141
<i>And billions of people</i>
<i>would be starving to death...</i>

34:26.311 --> 34:28.779
<i>...because we don't have food</i>
<i>to feed them.</i>

34:31.649 --> 34:34.482
None of that happened,
It didn't even remotely happen.

34:41.092 --> 34:43.583
<i>By the late '90s,</i>
<i>the global warming thing...</i>

34:43.728 --> 34:46.094
<i>...it became kind of</i>
<i>a secular apocalypse...</i>

34:46.231 --> 34:50.292
<i>...sort of a millenarianism for liberals.</i>

34:50.467 --> 34:53.164
It's not just a prediction,
it was like, "Oh, boy.

34:53.338 --> 34:57.034
Disaster is coming, and we,
the chosen ones, well, we were right.

34:57.208 --> 35:00.541
We'll come out the other side
and say, 'See, we were right."'

35:00.712 --> 35:03.806
So I was a climate skeptic
for several decades, actually.

35:03.982 --> 35:05.506
<i>But data trumps politics.</i>

35:05.683 --> 35:08.652
<i>In the end,</i>
<i>you have to follow the data.</i>

35:09.888 --> 35:13.483
<i>I read, you know, all the leading books</i>
<i>and scientific papers.</i>

35:13.658 --> 35:17.651
<i>I'm trained enough to realize</i>
<i>what the data actually show.</i>

35:18.530 --> 35:21.727
<i>I thought,</i>
<i>"Oh, my God, this stuff is real."</i>

35:21.900 --> 35:23.925
<i>Take all the politics out...</i>

35:24.135 --> 35:26.126
...the Earth is getting warmer...

35:26.271 --> 35:28.671
...and we're the cause,
no question about it.

35:28.840 --> 35:32.401
So this isn't the greatest hoax
ever sold to the American people?

35:32.577 --> 35:35.740
No, climate change is not
the greatest hoax ever sold to us.

35:35.914 --> 35:39.509
But people on the right,
they really think it is, even Libertarians.

35:39.684 --> 35:44.087
<i>I go to this Libertarian conference every</i>
<i>summer, Freedom Fest in Las Vegas.</i>

35:50.228 --> 35:52.696
The Cato Institute
is a Libertarian think tank.

35:52.864 --> 35:55.697
We're dedicated to free markets
and individual liberty.

35:55.867 --> 35:58.165
Freedom from government,
limited government.

35:58.303 --> 36:01.363
The Heartland Institute believes
warming is not man-made.

36:01.539 --> 36:05.532
This is our event today. James Taylor
is with The Heartland Institute.

36:05.710 --> 36:07.109
-Okay.
-Who is he debating?

36:07.278 --> 36:09.746
He is debating Mr. Shermer...

36:09.914 --> 36:12.940
...who is--
He writes for <i>Skeptic Magazine</i>...

36:13.117 --> 36:16.553
...but James Taylor
is doing the skeptic side today.

36:16.721 --> 36:20.248
We'll see what happens at the debate.
Yeah, we'll go to that.

36:20.425 --> 36:25.453
They think of me as some liberal crazy,
conspiracy-- Putting together this con--

36:25.630 --> 36:27.689
This made-up story
about climate change.

36:27.832 --> 36:31.461
I'm like, "I used to be on your side.
All I did was look at the data."

36:33.137 --> 36:36.072
<i>I've been Libertarian</i>
<i>my whole adult life.</i>

36:36.241 --> 36:39.768
Since I read <i>Atlas Shrugged</i> in college,
like everybody else here.

36:39.944 --> 36:42.435
I prefer to read
<i>The Wall Street Journal...</i>

36:42.614 --> 36:44.104
...and ignore <i>The NY Times...</i>

36:44.282 --> 36:47.479
...because <i>The Journal</i> tells me
what I like to know is true.

36:47.652 --> 36:50.849
So what flipped me
was just sort of looking at the data...

36:51.022 --> 36:54.014
...and all the new data
that had come in the early 2000s.

36:54.225 --> 36:57.592
Ninety-nine percent
of the world's glaciers are retreating.

36:57.762 --> 37:01.630
<i>Why don't people change their minds</i>
<i>when new data comes in about climate?</i>

37:01.799 --> 37:03.767
Because it isn't about the data.

37:03.935 --> 37:06.836
It's about me being
a consistent tribal member...

37:07.005 --> 37:10.771
...and showing to my fellow tribe
members that you can count on me.

37:10.942 --> 37:15.379
The whole global warming debate
is based upon your team...

37:15.547 --> 37:17.139
-...starting out--
-"My team."

37:17.315 --> 37:20.307
Yeah, your team. Starting out
by making the declaration...

37:20.485 --> 37:23.045
...that carbon dioxide
causes temperature change.

37:23.254 --> 37:24.881
First, it's not fifty-fifty.

37:25.056 --> 37:28.753
It's not like half of scientists say this
and the other half say that.

37:28.893 --> 37:31.953
Almost none of them
say what my opponent says.

37:32.130 --> 37:35.566
-That's a lie.
-No, none. I showed you the chart. No.

37:35.767 --> 37:38.395
-Ninety-nine percent of scientists--
-That's a lie!

37:38.570 --> 37:40.902
You can repeat it,
but it won't make it true.

37:41.072 --> 37:43.836
Ninety-nine percent
have said that it's real.

37:44.008 --> 37:46.533
-That is a bold-faced lie.
-No, it is not.

37:49.814 --> 37:52.806
<i>When I go into these debates,</i>
<i>it feels like I'm going...</i>

37:52.984 --> 37:56.317
<i>...into a <i>Twilight Zone</i> episode.</i>

37:57.989 --> 38:00.321
<i>You know, where black is white,</i>
<i>up is down...</i>

38:00.491 --> 38:03.790
<i>...and everything is just the opposite</i>
<i>of what you think it is.</i>

38:05.663 --> 38:10.066
Two parallel worlds
that exist side by side.

38:12.070 --> 38:16.871
And each of us
has a counterpart in this world.

38:17.041 --> 38:19.566
Carbon dioxide increases
have followed--

38:19.744 --> 38:23.874
<i>Whenever I deal with climate deniers,</i>
<i>it's almost like a mirrored reality.</i>

38:24.682 --> 38:27.515
<i>I put up the slide showing</i>
<i>the Earth getting warmer...</i>

38:27.685 --> 38:29.949
...and the other guys put up
the same slide:

38:30.121 --> 38:31.816
"The Earth is getting cooler."

38:31.956 --> 38:34.083
Temperatures now
are not abnormally warm.

38:34.258 --> 38:35.919
They're abnormally cool.

38:36.761 --> 38:40.595
Another dimension?
Another world parallel to ours?

38:40.765 --> 38:42.198
You call that rational?

38:44.102 --> 38:46.070
<i>When you look</i>
<i>at climate scientists...</i>

38:46.237 --> 38:49.035
<i>...we know who they are,</i>
<i>they work in science labs.</i>

38:50.074 --> 38:52.634
<i>On the other side,</i>
<i>people are not scientists.</i>

38:52.844 --> 38:53.970
Global warming....

38:54.145 --> 38:57.205
<i>Or if they are scientists,</i>
<i>they're not climate scientists.</i>

38:57.382 --> 38:59.850
<i>They're a political, ideological group...</i>

38:59.984 --> 39:03.886
...that just mines the data
that somebody else gets...

39:04.055 --> 39:09.127
...and cherry-picks data that fits
what they already want to be true.

39:09.394 --> 39:13.592
<i>An international group of scientific</i>
<i>experts said in no uncertain terms...</i>

39:13.765 --> 39:15.596
...global warming is real...

39:15.767 --> 39:20.261
...and it's almost certainly caused
by what we humans do to this planet.

39:21.472 --> 39:25.169
<i>The IPCC is the Intergovernmental</i>
<i>Panel on Climate Change...</i>

39:25.376 --> 39:29.506
<i>...and it literally consists of thousands</i>
<i>of professional climate scientists...</i>

39:29.681 --> 39:31.808
<i>...from all over the world.</i>

39:31.983 --> 39:34.918
<i>And then we have the NIPCC.</i>

39:35.086 --> 39:39.079
<i>You can say "Not IPCC."</i>
<i>We call it "nip-ick."</i>

39:39.257 --> 39:41.987
<i>We reached the opposite conclusion.</i>

39:42.160 --> 39:46.460
I want to-- I want to stress that
we didn't add any new scientific work.

39:48.032 --> 39:50.000
They present themselves
as scientific.

39:50.168 --> 39:53.660
They use graphics to make them
look like the scientific reports...

39:53.838 --> 39:55.601
...they're trying to discredit.

39:55.773 --> 40:00.938
This is a report produced by the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

40:01.112 --> 40:05.481
And here is the mirror of that
produced by the Cato Institute.

40:10.822 --> 40:15.020
<i>They've adopted the exact</i>
<i>same page layout and design.</i>

40:19.063 --> 40:23.966
<i>If you're a congressman, how do you tell</i>
<i>the difference between this and this one?</i>

40:24.802 --> 40:27.635
And that's the point of this deception.

40:28.740 --> 40:30.731
This is kind of an extended summary.

40:30.942 --> 40:33.035
-It's called a synthesis report.
-Yeah.

40:33.211 --> 40:37.671
The actual IPCC report
is about so thick.

40:37.849 --> 40:40.875
And how thick is your NIPCC report?

40:41.052 --> 40:42.952
Same.

40:43.087 --> 40:45.385
-It's same.
-You're as thick as they are?

40:45.556 --> 40:48.753
We strictly use the same thickness.

40:48.960 --> 40:51.326
So it's 97 percent of them
and one of you.

40:51.963 --> 40:55.262
There's hundreds of us,
hundreds, thousands of us.

40:55.466 --> 40:59.197
Look, 31,000 scientists
and engineers...

40:59.370 --> 41:02.897
...signed a statement to the contrary
to what you just read.

41:03.074 --> 41:05.167
-The Oregon Petition?
-Yes.

41:06.711 --> 41:10.044
<i>The Oregon Petition claims</i>
<i>to be signed by climate scientists...</i>

41:10.214 --> 41:13.980
<i>...who disagree with the mainstream</i>
<i>view of the scientific community.</i>

41:14.118 --> 41:17.281
If you actually look at it,
what you find is in many cases...

41:17.488 --> 41:19.251
...they aren't scientists at all.

41:21.259 --> 41:23.784
<i>Somebody put on there</i>
<i>the Spice Girls.</i>

41:25.396 --> 41:27.796
<i>Somebody else put on there</i>
<i>Michael J. Fox.</i>

41:29.300 --> 41:31.427
<i>Even Charles Darwin made the list.</i>

41:32.804 --> 41:35.364
And in fact the claim
was so obviously false...

41:35.540 --> 41:38.373
...the National Academy
took the unprecedented step...

41:38.543 --> 41:42.104
...of publicly disavowing this petition.

41:42.280 --> 41:44.805
More than 31,000 scientists
signed a petition....

41:45.016 --> 41:47.382
<i>And yet, it gets cited</i>
<i>and it gets repeated.</i>

41:47.552 --> 41:49.747
More than 31,000 scientists....

41:49.921 --> 41:54.824
More than 31,000 American scientists
rejecting global warming alarmism.

41:55.893 --> 41:59.954
<i>They give the impression that it's a very</i>
<i>big network with lots of scientists.</i>

42:00.131 --> 42:01.792
But if you look closely...

42:01.966 --> 42:05.732
...you see it's a small number of people,
really just a handful.

42:06.838 --> 42:08.271
Hey, Fred.

42:08.439 --> 42:11.670
<i>It's kind of an amazing accomplishment</i>
<i>when you think of it...</i>

42:11.843 --> 42:16.405
<i>...that such a small group of people have</i>
<i>an enormous impact on public opinion.</i>

42:16.581 --> 42:20.915
<i>So that more than half the American</i>
<i>people think that the science isn't settled.</i>

42:27.458 --> 42:30.256
Reach out and touch another one.
This one here? Okay.

42:30.428 --> 42:33.329
Jason's card. Take a look at that.
Try and remember it.

42:33.497 --> 42:37.160
Don't tell me what it is.
I just want you to tell me when you see it.

42:37.335 --> 42:42.432
<i>As a magician I work hard to prevent my</i>
<i>audience from seeing through the trick.</i>

42:42.607 --> 42:45.576
A lot of people think
the hand is quicker than the eye.

42:45.710 --> 42:50.773
It's not really true. It's just the eye sees
a lot of things the mind never notices.

42:50.948 --> 42:52.472
Having trouble, I can tell.

42:52.650 --> 42:55.619
What card are you looking for,
maybe I can help. What?

42:55.786 --> 42:58.687
The four of--? Really?
Was it really the four of hearts?

42:58.856 --> 43:02.348
-It's under my cocktail. Show it to them.
-No, it's not.

43:02.526 --> 43:04.494
Yeah.

43:05.963 --> 43:07.225
Yeah.

43:07.398 --> 43:12.802
And now maybe if you watch it enough
times with the benefit of a recording...

43:12.970 --> 43:15.461
<i>...maybe you figure out the trick.</i>

43:15.640 --> 43:19.701
I don't want you to tell me what it is,
I want you to tell me when you see it.

43:19.877 --> 43:24.143
But if you actually see the method,
once you see that, you won't un-see it.

43:24.315 --> 43:28.752
Then you can see me
put it there time and time again.

43:28.920 --> 43:32.378
Once revealed, never concealed.

43:37.361 --> 43:40.330
<i>It sort of comes back</i>
<i>to that idea of a playbook, right?</i>

43:40.498 --> 43:42.659
<i>What shape is it gonna take next?</i>

43:42.833 --> 43:45.324
But look at this, see? See, there's this.

43:45.503 --> 43:49.997
<i>As science started catching up</i>
<i>to the flame-retardant chemical makers...</i>

43:50.174 --> 43:52.165
...their tactics got even bolder.

43:52.343 --> 43:54.641
Senate Bill 1-4-7.

43:54.779 --> 43:59.148
<i>In 2011, a bill was up</i>
<i>that would have changed the rule...</i>

43:59.283 --> 44:03.242
<i>...so companies didn't have to add</i>
<i>pounds of flame retardants to furniture.</i>

44:03.421 --> 44:05.582
Firefighters get cancer
at alarming rates.

44:05.756 --> 44:10.216
<i>There were firefighters</i>
<i>arguing that the rule didn't work.</i>

44:10.394 --> 44:14.888
<i>There were breast-feeding mothers</i>
<i>arguing they don't want it in babies' milk.</i>

44:15.066 --> 44:18.968
<i>Public health officials saying this isn't</i>
<i>good for us. I wanted to see...</i>

44:19.170 --> 44:20.865
...what does the other side say?

44:21.038 --> 44:23.097
Hi, I'm Dr. David Heimbach.

44:23.274 --> 44:25.765
<i>The real star-witness</i>
<i>was the burn surgeon.</i>

44:25.943 --> 44:28.969
And I've actually gotten
a Compassion Award...

44:29.180 --> 44:30.977
...from the Dalai Lama last year.

44:31.182 --> 44:35.676
He told this sad and dramatic story.

44:35.820 --> 44:38.482
A 7-week-old baby was in a crib...

44:38.689 --> 44:41.988
...laying on a fire-retardant mattress...

44:42.193 --> 44:45.287
...on a non-fire retardant pillow.

44:45.463 --> 44:48.762
Mom put a candle in the crib...

44:48.933 --> 44:53.393
...candle fell over,
the baby sustained a 50-percent burn.

44:53.571 --> 44:55.903
The entire upper half
of her body was burned.

44:56.073 --> 45:01.238
Now, this is a tiny, little person, no bigger
than my Italian greyhound at home.

45:01.412 --> 45:03.437
She ultimately died...

45:03.614 --> 45:07.414
...after about three weeks
of pain and misery in the hospital.

45:07.585 --> 45:11.021
I literally heard a gasp
when he told the story about this baby.

45:11.222 --> 45:13.087
He had the room in his hand.

45:13.257 --> 45:14.246
-Price?
-No.

45:14.425 --> 45:15.653
Price, no. Emerson?

45:15.826 --> 45:21.230
<i>When David Heimbach finished</i>
<i>speaking, you knew the bill would fail.</i>

45:22.466 --> 45:23.000
Okay, can I tuck you in?

45:23.000 --> 45:24.228
Okay, can I tuck you in?

45:24.368 --> 45:29.328
<i>I remember flying back to Chicago and</i>
<i>seeing my boys sleeping in their cribs...</i>

45:29.507 --> 45:32.874
<i>...and I'm thinking,</i>
<i>"Why would any mother...</i>

45:33.044 --> 45:37.037
<i>...put a candle in her baby's crib?"</i>

45:39.750 --> 45:42.685
<i>I got back to the newsroom,</i>
<i>what I talked to Sam about:</i>

45:42.853 --> 45:44.844
<i>"So, what have they argued</i>
<i>in the past?</i>

45:45.022 --> 45:48.514
<i>When have these bills come up before?</i>
<i>Did Dr. Heimbach show up?"</i>

45:48.692 --> 45:49.818
Last month I won a...

45:51.362 --> 45:55.059
...Unsung Heroes of Compassion
Award from the Dalai Lama.

45:55.266 --> 45:57.461
<i>Sure enough,</i>
<i>Heimbach had testified...</i>

45:57.635 --> 46:00.468
...and he told different stories
about babies...

46:00.638 --> 46:02.765
...who burned to death in candle fires.

46:02.907 --> 46:05.467
Tell you about a child
I took care of in April...

46:05.643 --> 46:09.272
...about a 9-week-old baby,
about the size of a teddy bear....

46:09.413 --> 46:11.881
<i>And that's when Sam and I</i>
<i>sat down, we're like:</i>

46:12.049 --> 46:15.018
"We got three babies
who died in candle fires...

46:15.186 --> 46:18.917
...all treated at Dr. Heimbach's hospital.
We gotta find those babies."

46:22.693 --> 46:24.991
<i>So I called</i>
<i>the medical examiner's office.</i>

46:25.162 --> 46:29.929
Asked them to run a computer program of
18 years of deaths of babies or toddlers...

46:30.101 --> 46:33.662
<i>...where Dr. Heimbach</i>
<i>had his hospital and practice.</i>

46:34.371 --> 46:37.204
<i>There was not any death of any child...</i>

46:37.374 --> 46:40.707
<i>...that matched</i>
<i>Dr. Heimbach's description.</i>

46:41.612 --> 46:44.877
I thought the best thing to do
was just to call him at home.

46:46.183 --> 46:51.712
<i>I said, "Those kids you talked about,</i>
<i>did they all die in your hospital?"</i>

46:51.889 --> 46:56.189
And he said,
"It wasn't factual, it was anecdotal."

46:56.360 --> 47:00.524
And he said, "Listen, the details
don't matter. The principle matters."

47:00.698 --> 47:03.599
I go, "What's the principle?"
He says, "The principle...

47:03.767 --> 47:07.533
...is flame retardants work." I said,
"That's not what you testified."

47:07.905 --> 47:10.703
And he said,
"Well, I wasn't under oath."

47:10.875 --> 47:14.709
Were either one of you paid for your
time here in opposition to the bill?

47:14.879 --> 47:16.039
Citizens for Fire Safety.

47:16.213 --> 47:17.237
Okay, thank you.

47:17.414 --> 47:20.906
Citizens for Fire Safety
are paying for my trip here, yes.

47:21.085 --> 47:26.489
<i>Records showed that they paid</i>
<i>Dr. Heimbach $2 40,000.</i>

47:26.657 --> 47:29.888
So who is
Citizens for Fire Safety, right?

47:30.060 --> 47:33.052
<i>What they were claiming was,</i>
<i>they were a broad coalition.</i>

47:33.564 --> 47:37.933
<i>Their website had this picture</i>
<i>of five smiling kids holding...</i>

47:38.102 --> 47:41.230
<i>...a hand-drawn banner</i>
<i>with the words "Fire Safety" on it...</i>

47:41.405 --> 47:43.464
<i>...and there was a heart dotting the I.</i>

47:43.641 --> 47:47.475
<i>Turns out, that in California, that if</i>
<i>you have fewer than 50 members...</i>

47:47.645 --> 47:53.140
...in your trade group, you have
to disclose who your members are.

47:55.252 --> 47:59.086
<i>Who were the members? The members</i>
<i>were the three largest makers...</i>

47:59.256 --> 48:02.748
<i>...of flame retardants in the world.</i>
<i>All that was in that group.</i>

48:02.927 --> 48:05.452
So there was no question...

48:05.629 --> 48:08.189
...Citizens for Fire Safety
was a front group.

48:09.533 --> 48:14.129
<i>The story came out,</i>
<i>and Citizens for Fire Safety folded.</i>

48:14.305 --> 48:17.399
<i>And the law changed.</i>
<i>So now companies can make furniture...</i>

48:17.541 --> 48:19.270
<i>...without flame retardants.</i>

48:19.443 --> 48:23.209
<i>But that took two years</i>
<i>of investigating.</i>

48:24.782 --> 48:29.412
<i>Citizens for Fire Safety was pretending</i>
<i>to be looking out for consumers...</i>

48:29.553 --> 48:33.353
<i>...when in reality it was looking out</i>
<i>for the interests of its funders.</i>

48:34.692 --> 48:37.684
<i>How many other groups are out there</i>
<i>doing the same thing?</i>

49:01.485 --> 49:04.477
<i>In the 1980s, after I had testified,</i>
<i>I decided to...</i>

49:06.323 --> 49:08.985
...bail out of the public aspect
of this problem...

49:09.159 --> 49:12.356
...because I was very uncomfortable
in that role.

49:13.364 --> 49:16.458
<i>And I thought,</i>
<i>as the story becomes clearer...</i>

49:16.600 --> 49:19.694
<i>...we will then take the actions</i>
<i>that are needed.</i>

49:19.870 --> 49:25.069
By the year 2000, it had become so clear
that we were not doing anything.

49:28.712 --> 49:32.478
<i>The science has become so clear.</i>

49:33.384 --> 49:37.514
<i>The things that we predicted</i>
<i>are actually happening...</i>

49:37.688 --> 49:41.556
<i>...and some of them are even</i>
<i>happening faster than we thought.</i>

49:41.725 --> 49:44.057
<i>The ice cap has shrunk 23 percent.</i>

49:44.228 --> 49:46.628
<i>The ice is already 50 percent smaller.</i>

49:46.797 --> 49:50.733
-<i>Every state in the U.S. set a heat record.</i>
-<i>Driest year in half a century.</i>

49:50.901 --> 49:52.698
<i>Massive Arizona wildfire....</i>

49:52.870 --> 49:56.237
<i>This storm may be the strongest</i>
<i>tropical cyclone on Earth...</i>

49:56.407 --> 49:58.637
-<i>...to make landfall.</i>
-<i>A category five...</i>

49:58.809 --> 50:02.905
<i>...and that is only because</i>
<i>there are no categories above five.</i>

50:03.080 --> 50:06.572
<i>We know as much about</i>
<i>how the climate works...</i>

50:06.750 --> 50:10.083
<i>...as doctors know about</i>
<i>how your body works.</i>

50:12.656 --> 50:17.923
<i>The scientific method is, you have to</i>
<i>continually reassess your conclusions.</i>

50:18.095 --> 50:22.327
<i>As soon as there's new data, you ask,</i>
<i>"How does that affect my interpretation?"</i>

50:22.533 --> 50:24.967
<i>And you're open-minded.</i>

50:25.135 --> 50:28.901
What we're up against is people
who have a preferred answer...

50:29.073 --> 50:32.531
...and so then they take
the position of a lawyer.

50:32.676 --> 50:36.407
They're going to defend their client,
and they will only present you...

50:36.580 --> 50:39.310
...with the data that favors their client.

50:41.151 --> 50:44.245
<i>As the scientific community</i>
<i>coalesces around believing...</i>

50:44.421 --> 50:48.653
...climate change is underway, it's at that
moment that we see the think tanks...

50:48.826 --> 50:53.058
...moving into the media environment
and trying to argue the opposite.

51:02.573 --> 51:05.838
<i>In the missile age, it is vital</i>
<i>to try to picture in advance...</i>

51:06.009 --> 51:07.499
<i>...how crises might develop.</i>

51:08.846 --> 51:11.144
<i>So the idea behind a think tank</i>
<i>is to think.</i>

51:11.315 --> 51:14.443
<i>One early example of a think tank</i>
<i>is the RAND Corporation...</i>

51:14.618 --> 51:16.643
<i>...which was set up to give advice...</i>

51:16.820 --> 51:20.119
<i>...about how to solve problems</i>
<i>that the military faced.</i>

51:20.290 --> 51:24.124
I find it difficult to see how we could
say it was an air-dropped weapon.

51:24.294 --> 51:27.627
<i>What is of use is if you have</i>
<i>an independent group who can...</i>

51:27.798 --> 51:30.130
<i>...look at data,</i>
<i>work through the issue of...</i>

51:30.300 --> 51:32.894
<i>...what would solutions</i>
<i>to that problem look like.</i>

51:33.103 --> 51:35.901
Is there a capability of tracking them?
I don't know.

51:36.473 --> 51:39.909
<i>It devolves into something</i>
<i>that's highly partisan...</i>

51:40.110 --> 51:43.671
<i>...and has made up its mind</i>
<i>in advance what the answer is.</i>

51:49.119 --> 51:53.681
<i>So what we begin to see is think tanks</i>
<i>taking up climate change as an issue...</i>

51:53.857 --> 51:58.692
<i>...but not from the point of view of science</i>
<i>but from the point of view of the politics.</i>

51:59.897 --> 52:04.891
<i>And one of the first groups to do that</i>
<i>is the George C. Marshall Institute.</i>

52:14.778 --> 52:16.905
<i>I work on motorcycles.</i>

52:17.080 --> 52:19.844
<i>Either the bike starts and runs right,</i>
<i>or it doesn't.</i>

52:20.017 --> 52:23.384
And if it doesn't, there's no weaseling
your way out of the fact.

52:26.290 --> 52:29.748
And I like that about it.
You might say the BS quotient is low.

52:30.694 --> 52:35.256
Unless you're working on Harleys, in
which case it can actually be pretty high.

52:42.739 --> 52:46.869
<i>I got myself</i>
<i>into a PhD program at Chicago.</i>

52:47.044 --> 52:50.673
<i>So when I finished, I got a phone call</i>
<i>from a former teacher...</i>

52:50.814 --> 52:52.975
<i>...who informed me about this job...</i>

52:53.183 --> 52:55.743
...at the Marshall Institute.

52:56.453 --> 53:00.082
And, you know, the salary was huge.

53:01.492 --> 53:05.223
<i>At Marshall Institute, coming into it</i>
<i>knowing that they were sort of...</i>

53:05.395 --> 53:08.387
<i>...on the skeptical side</i>
<i>of the global warming stuff...</i>

53:08.565 --> 53:12.433
...you know, I was more or less
down with that.

53:12.603 --> 53:15.902
At the same time that I started,
there was a new president.

53:16.573 --> 53:18.939
<i>O'Keefe was a different kind</i>
<i>of animal.</i>

53:19.109 --> 53:22.943
<i>He had come</i>
<i>from sort of the business world...</i>

53:23.113 --> 53:25.081
<i>...so he had a different mentality.</i>

53:25.249 --> 53:27.615
He liked to mention
that he knew Karl Rove.

53:27.784 --> 53:31.982
So in other words, he's plugged-in
and he's an operator.

53:32.155 --> 53:38.094
It's an incredibly complex subject,
and it's really about politics...

53:38.262 --> 53:40.526
...and political control...

53:40.731 --> 53:46.226
...and control of economic means
of production.

53:46.370 --> 53:48.861
Climate is just a mechanism.

53:49.873 --> 53:52.000
I'm pleased to be part
of your program...

53:52.175 --> 53:55.542
...and you're in the offices
of the George C. Marshall Institute.

53:57.014 --> 53:58.811
A small science-policy think tank.

53:58.982 --> 54:01.143
Is Marshall actually doing science?

54:01.318 --> 54:03.183
No, we're not doing science.

54:03.987 --> 54:08.287
<i>What I try to do is make sure</i>
<i>our work reaches decision makers...</i>

54:08.458 --> 54:10.289
<i>...reaches people in the media...</i>

54:10.460 --> 54:14.328
...so that we are part of shaping
the public policy debate.

54:16.033 --> 54:20.697
<i>I think a lot of people who get into that</i>
<i>think tank world start out as intellectuals...</i>

54:20.871 --> 54:23.635
<i>...but, you know,</i>
<i>in the mixing pot of Washington...</i>

54:23.807 --> 54:26.469
<i>...arguments become weapons.</i>

54:26.643 --> 54:30.135
Part of this was gathering arguments
that were already out there...

54:30.314 --> 54:32.976
...they weren't always compatible
with one another.

54:33.150 --> 54:36.313
Sometimes the argument was that,
"The Earth is not warming."

54:36.486 --> 54:41.014
We don't see a warming
of the atmosphere in the last 50 years.

54:41.191 --> 54:45.093
<i>At another time the argument would be,</i>
<i>"Well, yes, the Earth is warming...</i>

54:45.295 --> 54:47.991
<i>...but it's not due to human activities."</i>

54:48.165 --> 54:51.999
The fact that glaciers are melting
does not mean that the cause is human.

54:52.169 --> 54:54.194
It only means that it's getting warmer.

54:54.371 --> 54:57.534
<i>At another time the argument would be,</i>
<i>"Yes, it is warming...</i>

54:57.708 --> 55:02.168
<i>...and it's due to human activities, but</i>
<i>the cost of doing something about it...</i>

55:02.346 --> 55:04.610
<i>...would be ruinous for society."</i>

55:04.815 --> 55:07.545
Of course there is a human influence
on climate.

55:07.718 --> 55:09.709
We've known it for a decade or more.

55:09.886 --> 55:12.719
If they go ahead
and regulate CO2 as a pollutant...

55:12.889 --> 55:16.552
...it will basically stop economic growth
in the United States.

55:16.727 --> 55:19.821
And this is what many
of the enviros want.

55:24.368 --> 55:27.269
<i>The occasion for me finally quitting...</i>

55:27.437 --> 55:30.201
<i>...was that I got a call</i>
<i>from somebody...</i>

55:30.374 --> 55:36.438
<i>...who was updating</i>
<i>a directory of lobbyists...</i>

55:38.882 --> 55:42.579
<i>...and they wanted to know</i>
<i>if Bill O'Keefe...</i>

55:42.753 --> 55:46.450
...was indeed the president
of the George C. Marshall Institute.

55:46.623 --> 55:50.582
I said, "Yeah, but why are you asking?

55:50.761 --> 55:54.390
Why--? Is he part of this directory?"
And they said, "Yes."

55:55.666 --> 56:01.298
<i>I confronted O'Keefe and said,</i>
<i>"Are you a registered lobbyist?"</i>

56:01.471 --> 56:03.666
<i>And he got extremely angry.</i>

56:03.874 --> 56:08.868
<i>I tried to get him to tell me, if he was,</i>
<i>who his clients were. He wouldn't tell me.</i>

56:10.580 --> 56:12.275
<i>And when you went to Marshall...</i>

56:12.449 --> 56:17.386
...were you still connected in any way
to the petroleum business?

56:18.588 --> 56:22.490
I think I had--
Yes, I had an oil company as a client.

56:22.659 --> 56:27.392
So were you a lobbyist
when you went to work for Marshall?

56:27.531 --> 56:30.432
I was still registered as a lobbyist.

56:30.600 --> 56:34.195
That seemed
utterly preposterous to me...

56:34.404 --> 56:36.304
...that you would have...

56:36.473 --> 56:41.342
...as the president of a think tank
a guy who's a registered lobbyist.

56:41.511 --> 56:45.971
It's just the whole pretense of the place
goes out the window at that point.

56:46.450 --> 56:49.180
<i>And so we had sort of a blowup</i>
<i>and I quit.</i>

56:51.421 --> 56:56.449
<i>So for me, at least, there's more</i>
<i>real thinking going on in a bike shop...</i>

56:56.626 --> 56:59.060
<i>...than there was in the think tank.</i>

57:00.030 --> 57:03.363
If you were hired by
a Greenpeace organization to figure out...

57:03.533 --> 57:07.867
...how to present climate as a problem,
what would you--?

57:08.038 --> 57:11.940
-What would you suggest to them?
-They couldn't afford me.

57:14.211 --> 57:17.544
At the same time
O'Keefe is a lobbyist for ExxonMobil....

57:18.982 --> 57:22.884
When I was at Greenpeace, we looked
into who was funding these think tanks.

57:24.755 --> 57:27.053
And you started to find ExxonMobil...

57:27.224 --> 57:29.259
<i>...and the Koch brothers</i>
<i>and the Southern Company.</i>

57:29.259 --> 57:30.521
<i>...and the Koch brothers</i>
<i>and the Southern Company.</i>

57:30.694 --> 57:35.324
ExxonMobil has been a major funder
of climate change disinformation.

57:36.666 --> 57:39.032
<i>They funded</i>
<i>over 30 different organizations...</i>

57:39.202 --> 57:40.999
<i>...that promoted disinformation...</i>

57:41.171 --> 57:44.038
<i>...or misleading information</i>
<i>about climate change.</i>

57:44.975 --> 57:47.068
<i>Nobody's gonna believe ExxonMobil.</i>

57:47.244 --> 57:51.613
But if they can say it through somebody
else who seems independent...

57:51.782 --> 57:53.682
...there's power in that for them.

57:53.850 --> 57:57.081
<i>Myron Ebell is Director of Energy</i>
<i>and Global Warming Policy...</i>

57:57.254 --> 57:59.279
<i>...for Competitive Enterprise</i>
<i>Institute.</i>

57:59.489 --> 58:02.549
<i>Senior fellow and science director</i>
<i>of Heartland Institute.</i>

58:02.726 --> 58:06.628
-<i>The idea that cooling....</i>
-<i>It creates a new cast of characters.</i>

58:06.797 --> 58:10.893
<i>These people who become well-known</i>
<i>for casting doubt on global warming.</i>

58:11.067 --> 58:14.628
-<i>Dr. Marlo Lewis, a senior fellow....</i>
-<i>What these institutes do...</i>

58:14.805 --> 58:18.536
...is they promote their own "experts"
as contrary experts...

58:18.708 --> 58:22.610
...who give you the "other side"
of the issue, and journalists fall for it.

58:22.779 --> 58:26.647
-Fall for it lock, stock, and barrel.
-<i>Let's talk to a couple of experts.</i>

58:26.817 --> 58:29.217
-<i>Joining us....</i>
-<i>Scientists will be invited...</i>

58:29.386 --> 58:32.446
<i>...to explain the science</i>
<i>and then against the scientist...</i>

58:32.622 --> 58:36.422
<i>...they will have a so-called expert</i>
<i>from a think tank.</i>

58:36.593 --> 58:39.562
And so the public is presented
with dueling experts.

58:39.729 --> 58:43.460
<i>Steven Zebiak is General Director</i>
<i>of International Research Institute...</i>

58:43.633 --> 58:45.658
<i>...and Climate and Society at Columbia.</i>

58:45.836 --> 58:49.033
<i>James Taylor is a senior fellow</i>
<i>at the Heartland Institute.</i>

58:49.172 --> 58:51.834
<i>If you actually ask</i>
<i>what are their credentials...</i>

58:52.042 --> 58:54.636
...the answer's often very little,
sometimes none.

58:54.811 --> 58:59.839
In college, I majored in government.
I also took atmospheric science courses.

59:02.185 --> 59:04.983
That makes me well-positioned
to bring together...

59:05.155 --> 59:10.058
...all the aspects of this debate because
it's scientific, it's economic, it's political.

59:12.462 --> 59:17.559
<i>There are think tanks that do nothing</i>
<i>but crank out op-ed pieces every day.</i>

59:18.101 --> 59:21.935
<i>If you start tracking them, you'll see</i>
<i>it's the same handful of people...</i>

59:22.105 --> 59:25.074
<i>...that just keep pumping out</i>
<i>this material.</i>

59:25.842 --> 59:29.869
<i>Some of these so-called experts,</i>
<i>they become go-to people.</i>

59:30.080 --> 59:33.641
<i>A handful of them turn out</i>
<i>to be very, very good at it.</i>

59:36.453 --> 59:39.980
The global warming alarm spread
by Al Gore and the United Nations...

59:40.156 --> 59:42.147
...is in utter scientific collapse.

59:42.325 --> 59:45.488
We've gone 18 years without global
warming according to data.

59:45.662 --> 59:49.655
Akin to medieval witchcraft where we
blame witches for controlling weather.

59:49.966 --> 59:53.800
<i>You were described as the godfather</i>
<i>of climate change denying.</i>

59:53.970 --> 59:57.098
-<i>The mastermind of the whole</i>-- <i>Yes.</i>
-<i>Yeah. Yeah.</i>

59:57.240 --> 01:00:00.141
What do you call yourself?
Are you...?

01:00:02.646 --> 01:00:04.876
What do I call myself?

01:00:07.217 --> 01:00:10.243
I guess I'm an environmental journalist
on some level.

01:00:10.420 --> 01:00:14.117
After the Greens out there finish puking
after hearing me say that...

01:00:14.257 --> 01:00:16.623
...I will say, that's how I started.

01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:18.751
And will, to the best of my ability--

01:00:20.163 --> 01:00:23.155
<i>I was a volunteer for Ronald Reagan</i>
<i>in 1980, at age 12.</i>

01:00:23.333 --> 01:00:24.732
When you were growing up...

01:00:24.901 --> 01:00:27.836
-...you were a door-to-door salesman?
-Yeah.

01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:32.665
<i>I learned so much</i>
<i>from door-to-door sales.</i>

01:00:32.842 --> 01:00:35.333
<i>I did gutter cleaning.</i>

01:00:35.512 --> 01:00:38.379
<i>You learn then</i>
<i>what communication tactics worked...</i>

01:00:38.548 --> 01:00:40.345
<i>...and what didn't.</i>

01:00:40.517 --> 01:00:43.645
How did you meet Rush Limbaugh?

01:00:43.787 --> 01:00:47.018
Rush Limbaugh I met in 1991.

01:00:47.190 --> 01:00:48.452
Our man in Washington...

01:00:48.658 --> 01:00:52.059
...an ever more and more
popular part of this show.

01:00:52.228 --> 01:00:53.889
<i>There he is sneaking in.</i>

01:00:54.064 --> 01:00:57.591
I used to hang out at the men's room
at these events...

01:00:57.767 --> 01:01:01.168
<i>...so I'd guarantee</i>
<i>I'd get just about every big name.</i>

01:01:01.304 --> 01:01:03.795
As the night went on,
they'd be drinking more...

01:01:03.974 --> 01:01:06.408
...so you'd always get
much better interviews.

01:01:06.576 --> 01:01:07.941
Women should deny sex...

01:01:09.312 --> 01:01:11.940
...until we clean up this planet.
Not all women.

01:01:12.115 --> 01:01:15.084
You decided to go to work
for Senator James Inhofe.

01:01:15.251 --> 01:01:18.482
-Wow, you're jumping. Okay.
-Your energy--

01:01:18.688 --> 01:01:22.556
I thought this was Marc Morano, my life.
No. Oh, okay.

01:01:24.294 --> 01:01:28.993
-Catastrophic global warming is a hoax.
-<i>I got a call from Inhofe's office...</i>

01:01:29.199 --> 01:01:32.794
...to be the new communications
director. It was the lowest point...

01:01:32.969 --> 01:01:37.303
...when I started, in June 2008,
for global warming skeptics.

01:01:47.017 --> 01:01:50.282
<i>If you look at the 10 hottest years</i>
<i>ever measured...</i>

01:01:50.453 --> 01:01:53.013
<i>...they've all occurred</i>
<i>in the last 14 years...</i>

01:01:53.223 --> 01:01:56.158
<i>...and the hottest of all was 2005.</i>

01:01:57.827 --> 01:02:00.125
Al Gore's film--
I'd just watched the movie.

01:02:00.296 --> 01:02:03.231
I watched it the week
before I started the job.

01:02:04.834 --> 01:02:08.361
<i>It was poised to win awards.</i>
<i>Later, he won the Nobel Prize for it.</i>

01:02:08.538 --> 01:02:11.166
So we decided for Inhofe
to go on the offensive.

01:02:11.341 --> 01:02:13.741
NASA scientist
and alarmist James Hansen--

01:02:13.877 --> 01:02:17.836
He's NASA's vocal man-made-
global-warming-fear soothsayer--

01:02:18.014 --> 01:02:20.847
He'd say almost anything
you asked him to say.

01:02:21.017 --> 01:02:24.680
On some levels, it was not so much
directly talking about science...

01:02:24.854 --> 01:02:27.755
...but it was going after
the scientists themselves?

01:02:27.891 --> 01:02:30.951
I mean, that was a change
that you brought to Inhofe.

01:02:31.127 --> 01:02:33.288
Yes, in fact we went after...

01:02:33.463 --> 01:02:36.057
...James Hansen
and Michael Oppenheimer...

01:02:36.266 --> 01:02:38.200
...and had a lot of fun with it.

01:02:39.636 --> 01:02:41.570
<i>We mocked and ridiculed Hansen.</i>

01:02:41.771 --> 01:02:44.399
<i>I couldn't believe they let me do this.</i>

01:02:47.544 --> 01:02:50.877
<i>I did a two-part, 10,000-word,</i>
<i>scathing critique on Hansen.</i>

01:02:52.549 --> 01:02:57.179
I'm not gonna question his scientific work,
but in terms of his influencing the public.

01:02:57.353 --> 01:03:00.789
And actually his scientific work
isn't really in question...

01:03:00.924 --> 01:03:04.223
...it's more of his public claims
and publicity and interviews.

01:03:04.394 --> 01:03:08.592
<i>I still felt restrained,</i>
<i>so I started doing what I call...</i>

01:03:08.798 --> 01:03:10.698
<i>... "the underground newsletters"...</i>

01:03:10.867 --> 01:03:14.098
...which went much further
than anything else, had more fun...

01:03:14.304 --> 01:03:17.034
...more humor, wit, sarcasm,
and sometimes nastiness.

01:03:17.207 --> 01:03:19.937
That went out and became
the basis for Climate Depot.

01:03:23.546 --> 01:03:25.878
<i>This is the new media's new world.</i>

01:03:26.049 --> 01:03:30.008
<i>This is an office where you rent it</i>
<i>as you need it, but we all know...</i>

01:03:30.186 --> 01:03:33.587
<i>...most of the work happens</i>
<i>on the road or in your home office.</i>

01:03:33.756 --> 01:03:37.248
They find no evidence
of a human fingerprint in that drought.

01:03:38.328 --> 01:03:41.320
<i>A lot of it's done in a taxicab</i>
<i>heading to, you know...</i>

01:03:41.464 --> 01:03:45.093
<i>...Fox News or CNN studio,</i>
<i>or even on the runway in an airplane.</i>

01:03:45.268 --> 01:03:48.032
James Hansen,
I call him NASA's resident ex-con...

01:03:48.204 --> 01:03:52.140
...is inspiring these people
to potential acts of eco-terrorism.

01:03:54.077 --> 01:03:56.409
Communication is about sales.
Keep it simple.

01:03:56.579 --> 01:04:00.208
People will fill in the blank with their own,
I hate to say biases...

01:04:00.383 --> 01:04:02.214
...but with their own perspective.

01:04:02.385 --> 01:04:05.786
<i>A global environmental organization</i>
<i>that'll police the world.</i>

01:04:07.123 --> 01:04:09.921
<i>Think of the</i>-- <i>Our own EPA,</i>
<i>that speaks French.</i>

01:04:10.093 --> 01:04:13.426
I'm not a scientist, although I do
play one on TV occasionally.

01:04:13.596 --> 01:04:15.587
Okay, hell, more than occasionally.

01:04:15.765 --> 01:04:18.734
Joining me, Bill Nye the Science Guy
and Marc Morano.

01:04:18.902 --> 01:04:22.394
<i>You go up against a scientist,</i>
<i>most of them...</i>

01:04:22.572 --> 01:04:26.736
...are gonna be in their own little,
policy-wonk world or area of expertise.

01:04:26.910 --> 01:04:31.973
So you look in the ice
and you find bubbles of trapped gas--

01:04:32.148 --> 01:04:35.879
Very arcane, very hard to understand,
hard to explain...

01:04:36.019 --> 01:04:38.180
...and very boring.

01:04:38.388 --> 01:04:41.118
Bottom line, new study
in <i>Nature,</i> peer-reviewed...

01:04:41.291 --> 01:04:43.885
...no change in U.S. drought
in the last 80 years.

01:04:44.027 --> 01:04:45.995
Bottom line,
a new study out shows--

01:04:46.162 --> 01:04:49.928
You can't be afraid of the absolute
hand-to-hand combat, metaphorically.

01:04:50.099 --> 01:04:53.000
You've gotta name names,
you gotta go after individuals.

01:04:53.169 --> 01:04:57.003
You can't just go after a system.
I think that's what I enjoy the most...

01:04:57.173 --> 01:05:00.802
...is going after the individuals,
where something lives or dies.

01:05:04.013 --> 01:05:08.416
<i>As a scientist, you're trained to defend</i>
<i>the science that you do.</i>

01:05:08.551 --> 01:05:10.781
<i>What you don't expect</i>
<i>is to have people...</i>

01:05:10.954 --> 01:05:13.821
...threaten you with all kinds
of dire consequences...

01:05:13.990 --> 01:05:18.017
...for continuing to do the research
that you do.

01:05:19.229 --> 01:05:25.168
<i>I was contacted by the IPCC</i>
<i>to act as convening lead author...</i>

01:05:25.335 --> 01:05:30.739
<i>...for one chapter</i>
<i>of the second assessment report.</i>

01:05:30.940 --> 01:05:35.240
<i>That final sentence,</i>
<i>"The balance of evidence suggests...</i>

01:05:35.445 --> 01:05:38.243
<i>...a discernible human influence</i>
<i>on global climate"...</i>

01:05:38.448 --> 01:05:42.179
<i>...was finalized</i>
<i>at the end of November, 1995.</i>

01:05:42.352 --> 01:05:47.380
I had no idea that my life
would be so dramatically changed...

01:05:47.557 --> 01:05:48.956
...by that one sentence.

01:05:49.726 --> 01:05:52.456
These are a few e-mails...

01:05:52.595 --> 01:05:56.087
...from a large number of e-mails
that I received.

01:05:56.266 --> 01:06:00.760
"Yeah, you-- You arrogant,
fucking piece-of-crap con man.

01:06:00.970 --> 01:06:03.530
I hope you are hung
by your pathetic, little neck.

01:06:03.706 --> 01:06:06.834
I'd love nothing more than
to beat you with a large stick...

01:06:07.010 --> 01:06:09.706
...you shit-eating Yank. Go die."

01:06:09.879 --> 01:06:14.714
It's possible I posted Santer's e-mail
in the early days of Climate Depot.

01:06:14.884 --> 01:06:17.375
He's far from the only one
I've done that to.

01:06:17.553 --> 01:06:21.512
"You're an effing terrorist,
you and your colleagues...

01:06:21.691 --> 01:06:25.024
...ought to be fed to the pigs,
along with your whole families."

01:06:26.396 --> 01:06:30.560
"How come no one has beat
the living piss out of you yet?

01:06:30.733 --> 01:06:35.193
I was hoping I would see the news
and you committed suicide."

01:06:35.371 --> 01:06:38.932
"You stupid bitch. I would like
to see you convicted and beheaded.

01:06:40.810 --> 01:06:44.610
If you have a child, then women
in the future will be even more leery...

01:06:44.781 --> 01:06:49.013
...of lying to get ahead when they see
your baby crying next to the guillotine."

01:06:49.152 --> 01:06:52.212
Sometimes it's one a week.
When your e-mail address...

01:06:52.388 --> 01:06:57.655
...gets posted online at Morano's website,
it's 200 or more in a day.

01:06:57.827 --> 01:07:02.025
Well, I think the most disturbing e-mails
and letters were ones that...

01:07:02.165 --> 01:07:04.224
...suggest there will be harm to you...

01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:06.834
...direct physical harm to you
and your family.

01:07:07.036 --> 01:07:09.061
I don't know what his complaint is--

01:07:09.238 --> 01:07:13.072
-I'll give you the philosophy behind it.
-Yeah, that's more important.

01:07:13.242 --> 01:07:15.676
Is he ready?
This is one of my favorite topics.

01:07:15.845 --> 01:07:20.339
In fact, I got on <i>ABC Nightly News</i>
just because I posted e-mails.

01:07:20.550 --> 01:07:21.847
I did a whole segment.

01:07:22.051 --> 01:07:24.849
The public is appropriately angry
at these scientists.

01:07:25.054 --> 01:07:28.854
No one's advocating violence,
but it is refreshing to see...

01:07:29.058 --> 01:07:31.549
...these scientists hear from the public.

01:07:31.694 --> 01:07:35.323
I think people should be thanking me.
I was doing a service.

01:07:35.498 --> 01:07:39.332
People go, "Oh, your death threats."
I get death threats. I enjoy them.

01:07:39.502 --> 01:07:42.869
It was one of the healthiest things
that could have happened...

01:07:43.072 --> 01:07:44.369
...in the climate debate.

01:07:44.574 --> 01:07:47.844
I make no apologies.
I still do it. I enjoy doing it.

01:07:51.314 --> 01:07:54.772
Every time we see the world
beginning to act on the science...

01:07:54.951 --> 01:07:57.852
...we see some kind of attack
designed to undermine it.

01:07:59.288 --> 01:08:03.884
<i>1995, the IPCC comes out with its</i>
<i>second assessment report that says...</i>

01:08:04.093 --> 01:08:06.527
<i>...yes, there's climate change.</i>
<i>What do we get?</i>

01:08:06.696 --> 01:08:11.133
<i>Massive attack on Ben Santer,</i>
<i>who's the lead author of the key chapter.</i>

01:08:11.300 --> 01:08:14.963
<i>In the second case, before the run-up</i>
<i>to the Kyoto negotiations...</i>

01:08:15.138 --> 01:08:18.198
<i>...when it looked like the world</i>
<i>was going to agree...</i>

01:08:18.374 --> 01:08:19.966
<i>...we had the Oregon Petition.</i>

01:08:21.511 --> 01:08:23.843
<i>It's a completely discredited document...</i>

01:08:24.013 --> 01:08:26.982
<i>...nevertheless, it did a lot of damage.</i>

01:08:28.117 --> 01:08:31.484
<i>Third time, Copenhagen.</i>
<i>Finally, we're gonna get an agreement.</i>

01:08:31.654 --> 01:08:34.350
<i>The U.S. is on board.</i>
<i>Obama has gone to Copenhagen.</i>

01:08:34.524 --> 01:08:36.492
<i>What do we get? Climategate.</i>

01:08:36.658 --> 01:08:39.423
A new scandal
that's burning up the Net these days...

01:08:39.629 --> 01:08:42.826
...that began with e-mails
that were stolen--

01:08:42.999 --> 01:08:46.264
<i>Suddenly, we see this release</i>
<i>of stolen e-mails.</i>

01:08:46.435 --> 01:08:49.269
<i>Lines taken out of context</i>
<i>to make it seem as if...</i>

01:08:49.439 --> 01:08:52.430
<i>...scientists were involved</i>
<i>in nefarious activities.</i>

01:08:52.642 --> 01:08:55.577
People started saying,
"What's going on in Copenhagen?"

01:08:55.745 --> 01:08:58.737
This is the upper echelon
of the U.N. It's been exposed...

01:08:58.915 --> 01:09:02.544
...as the best science that politics
and activists can manufacture.

01:09:02.718 --> 01:09:06.051
My initial reaction with the Climategate,
I thought, "Okay...

01:09:06.221 --> 01:09:09.214
...gosh, I hope I didn't flip
at the wrong point there.

01:09:09.392 --> 01:09:11.256
Maybe this is all baloney."

01:09:11.426 --> 01:09:14.725
<i>When you actually read the e-mails</i>
<i>in context, you go, "Okay...</i>

01:09:14.897 --> 01:09:18.697
<i>...he's not actually saying what</i>
<i>Rush Limbaugh said he was saying."</i>

01:09:18.868 --> 01:09:22.462
There's been three investigations
into Climategate, where they had...

01:09:22.671 --> 01:09:26.267
...independent committees go through
every e-mail. There was nothing.

01:09:26.442 --> 01:09:29.411
<i>They were trying</i>
<i>to find yet new ways to weaken...</i>

01:09:29.578 --> 01:09:32.377
<i>...this growing international accord.</i>

01:09:32.548 --> 01:09:35.881
All they have to do is slow down action.

01:09:36.953 --> 01:09:40.116
Gridlock is the greatest friend
a global warming skeptic has.

01:09:40.288 --> 01:09:43.986
That's all you really want.
There's no legislation we're championing.

01:09:44.193 --> 01:09:46.957
We're the negative force,
just trying to stop stuff.

01:09:47.129 --> 01:09:49.893
It's all about distraction,
it's all about confusion.

01:09:50.066 --> 01:09:53.593
It's about preventing you from looking
where the action really is...

01:09:53.769 --> 01:09:55.259
...which is in the science.

01:10:07.450 --> 01:10:11.716
Misdirection is the use
of the little lie to sell the big lie.

01:10:11.854 --> 01:10:16.120
The big lie and the floating lady,
the classic levitation illusion...

01:10:16.292 --> 01:10:20.353
<i>...is the mechanism that's used</i>
<i>to make the woman rise.</i>

01:10:20.530 --> 01:10:24.330
<i>The little lie is the passing of the hoop.</i>

01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:26.434
<i>The floating raises your skepticism.</i>

01:10:26.602 --> 01:10:28.968
<i>There must be a wire.</i>
<i>There must be threads.</i>

01:10:29.138 --> 01:10:30.628
<i>There must be something.</i>

01:10:30.806 --> 01:10:37.177
<i>And then the hoop is used</i>
<i>to specifically undo that. Cancel that.</i>

01:10:37.346 --> 01:10:40.440
So, really, misdirection is about focus.

01:10:40.616 --> 01:10:43.642
It's not so much about directing away
or misdirecting...

01:10:43.819 --> 01:10:45.150
...it's about direction.

01:10:45.321 --> 01:10:49.382
It's about bringing your attention
to something that engages you.

01:10:49.559 --> 01:10:53.362
And then, you don't see
anything else in the frame.

01:11:06.342 --> 01:11:10.836
<i>The tobacco companies knew</i>
<i>they have to appeal to something more...</i>

01:11:11.013 --> 01:11:13.709
...basic than this intellectual pursuit
of science.

01:11:13.883 --> 01:11:15.908
How do you do it?
Do it with freedom.

01:11:16.085 --> 01:11:19.020
<i>That's the way freedom dies.</i>
<i>Today it's smoking.</i>

01:11:19.188 --> 01:11:21.315
<i>But what will they try to regulate next?</i>

01:11:21.490 --> 01:11:25.187
<i>What will they try to regulate next?</i>
<i>What we can say? What we can read?</i>

01:11:25.361 --> 01:11:29.024
<i>I don't want Big Brother breathing</i>
<i>down my neck telling me what to do.</i>

01:11:29.198 --> 01:11:31.359
<i>Not just for smokers</i>
<i>but for nonsmokers...</i>

01:11:31.534 --> 01:11:34.298
<i>...and all others</i>
<i>who want to live their lives...</i>

01:11:34.437 --> 01:11:37.838
<i>...making their own decisions,</i>
<i>not having them made for them...</i>

01:11:38.007 --> 01:11:41.670
<i>...by the benevolent bureaucracy</i>
<i>of Washington wisdom or these other</i>--

01:11:41.844 --> 01:11:44.608
<i>By turning it into an abstract issue</i>
<i>of freedom...</i>

01:11:44.814 --> 01:11:47.681
<i>...and moving it away</i>
<i>from their corporate interests...</i>

01:11:47.850 --> 01:11:52.116
<i>...they can get people behind it.</i>
<i>Who can possibly be against freedom?</i>

01:11:52.321 --> 01:11:54.812
What happened was,
these other companies...

01:11:54.957 --> 01:11:59.053
...and other industries realized, like:
"Hey, this is a pretty good idea."

01:12:04.433 --> 01:12:08.597
<i>Everywhere you turn, somebody</i>
<i>is telling us what we can't eat.</i>

01:12:08.771 --> 01:12:12.935
<i>Do you ever feel like you're</i>
<i>always being told what not to do?</i>

01:12:13.109 --> 01:12:15.270
<i>These people tell us where to work...</i>

01:12:15.444 --> 01:12:18.277
...how many children to have,
how much energy to use...

01:12:18.447 --> 01:12:20.074
...how much water we can--

01:12:20.249 --> 01:12:23.082
On global warming,
you see the same thing happening.

01:12:23.252 --> 01:12:28.485
For literally decades, David Koch
has been just a tireless defender...

01:12:28.658 --> 01:12:31.092
...of our economic
and individual freedoms.

01:12:31.260 --> 01:12:33.421
I'd like to introduce
to you David Koch...

01:12:33.596 --> 01:12:36.224
...our chairman
at the Americans for Prosperity.

01:12:41.103 --> 01:12:46.939
<i>Koch Industries is heavily invested</i>
<i>in coal, oil, tar sands.</i>

01:12:47.109 --> 01:12:50.101
<i>They are some of the biggest polluters</i>
<i>in the country...</i>

01:12:50.279 --> 01:12:52.179
...received the largest fines.

01:12:53.883 --> 01:12:57.410
<i>They needed an army of people</i>
<i>to fight against regulation...</i>

01:12:57.586 --> 01:13:00.384
<i>...in the name of freedom.</i>

01:13:00.790 --> 01:13:05.022
Good afternoon,
fellow freedom fighters!

01:13:05.461 --> 01:13:09.522
<i>The group, Americans for Prosperity,</i>
<i>is holding a nationwide...</i>

01:13:09.699 --> 01:13:11.462
...<i>hot-air balloon tour.</i>

01:13:11.634 --> 01:13:14.694
<i>They're spreading a message</i>
<i>of global warming alarmism...</i>

01:13:14.904 --> 01:13:17.805
<i>...lost jobs, higher taxes,</i>
<i>and less freedom.</i>

01:13:17.973 --> 01:13:21.272
Over eight years ago,
we launched Americans for Prosperity...

01:13:23.612 --> 01:13:27.605
...and the goal behind it
was to provide grassroots support...

01:13:27.783 --> 01:13:30.115
...at the local and state level...

01:13:30.286 --> 01:13:32.982
...to push free-market policies.

01:13:34.790 --> 01:13:38.157
<i>And we have just over two million</i>
<i>people who've taken action.</i>

01:13:38.928 --> 01:13:41.021
<i>We now have an army too.</i>

01:13:42.465 --> 01:13:46.333
Do you try to figure out
if the science is real or not?

01:13:46.502 --> 01:13:50.063
-Or you don't even think of that?
-No. We're on the economic side.

01:13:50.239 --> 01:13:51.228
Howdy.

01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:55.376
<i>We study what they'll do to American</i>
<i>people in the name of global warming.</i>

01:13:55.544 --> 01:13:58.513
They won't drill for oil.
Guys, let's get moving here.

01:13:58.681 --> 01:14:02.583
Come on, it's not a really hard--
Not a really hard decision. Let's--

01:14:02.752 --> 01:14:05.744
For a long time it was just,
hey, <i>An Inconvenient Truth...</i>

01:14:05.955 --> 01:14:10.016
...and all these polar bears that seemed
to be drowning and horrible things...

01:14:10.192 --> 01:14:13.184
...that seemed to be happening.
A lot of Americans said:

01:14:13.362 --> 01:14:15.387
"Gosh. That seems like a bad thing."

01:14:15.564 --> 01:14:18.761
But then, through the education efforts
of a lot of groups...

01:14:18.968 --> 01:14:21.334
<i>...like Americans for Prosperity</i>
<i>and others...</i>

01:14:21.504 --> 01:14:24.871
...Americans began going,
"Wait, I'll pay more for everything.

01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:27.008
It means a little bit less freedom."

01:14:27.176 --> 01:14:29.736
<i>I think the American public</i>
<i>has moved our way.</i>

01:14:29.912 --> 01:14:32.039
<i>The polls confirm that.</i>

01:14:32.214 --> 01:14:34.580
<i>We want to make sure</i>
<i>that both parties know...</i>

01:14:34.750 --> 01:14:37.920
<i>...we'll hold them accountable.</i>
<i>Republicans, too, absolutely.</i>

01:14:42.391 --> 01:14:45.383
Should I think of you as a liberal,
a conservative, or...?

01:14:45.561 --> 01:14:48.121
Pretty conservative
is how you should think of me.

01:14:49.632 --> 01:14:52.226
Ninety-three American Conservative
Union Rating...

01:14:52.401 --> 01:14:55.495
...100 percent Christian Coalition,
National Right to Life.

01:14:55.638 --> 01:15:00.405
With your help,
we can reclaim the Congress.

01:15:00.576 --> 01:15:03.306
<i>I represented the 4th District</i>
<i>of South Carolina...</i>

01:15:03.512 --> 01:15:08.108
<i>...which is probably the reddest district</i>
<i>in the reddest state in the nation.</i>

01:15:09.084 --> 01:15:11.917
<i>When I was first in Congress,</i>
<i>I was a complete denier.</i>

01:15:12.087 --> 01:15:15.648
I said, "That's hooey, absolute nonsense.
Al Gore's imagination."

01:15:15.825 --> 01:15:20.524
I just that knew if it was coming from
the other team, it had to be wrong.

01:15:23.599 --> 01:15:25.533
<i>I got on the science committee...</i>

01:15:25.668 --> 01:15:30.731
<i>...and had the opportunity to go</i>
<i>to Antarctica twice, actually.</i>

01:15:31.740 --> 01:15:34.072
<i>I saw the evidence in the ice core.</i>

01:15:34.243 --> 01:15:37.144
<i>You can pull it up</i>
<i>and examine the CO2 levels.</i>

01:15:37.313 --> 01:15:38.974
<i>They were really stable.</i>

01:15:39.148 --> 01:15:42.811
And then coinciding with the
industrial revolution, there's an uptick.

01:15:42.985 --> 01:15:47.979
<i>The chemistry is real clear, that you're</i>
<i>changing the chemistry of the air.</i>

01:15:48.157 --> 01:15:50.557
So I decided,
really right then and there...

01:15:50.693 --> 01:15:53.287
...I'm gonna go back
and I'm gonna do something.

01:15:55.097 --> 01:15:57.622
Madam Speaker,
what I'd like to say tonight...

01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:00.826
...is that there is a need to act--

01:16:01.003 --> 01:16:03.699
And to come together
to find a solution...

01:16:03.873 --> 01:16:07.809
...that breaks our addiction to oil,
that creates new energy jobs...

01:16:07.977 --> 01:16:09.569
...and that cleans up the air.

01:16:09.712 --> 01:16:11.703
That was to my great peril...

01:16:11.881 --> 01:16:15.180
...with the Tea Party coming
and the Great Recession happening.

01:16:19.989 --> 01:16:23.083
<i>Tim Phillips is helping to organize</i>
<i>some protest parties.</i>

01:16:23.225 --> 01:16:25.853
It's a genuine grassroots uprising.

01:16:26.028 --> 01:16:29.395
Groups like Americans For Prosperity,
we're organizing.

01:16:31.667 --> 01:16:35.501
There's a tide of doubt that comes out
of the Great Recession...

01:16:35.671 --> 01:16:38.663
...where we started to doubt
every institution, you know.

01:16:39.174 --> 01:16:41.802
Along comes some people
that see the opportunity.

01:16:41.977 --> 01:16:44.673
Coming up next is
a global warming tax.

01:16:44.847 --> 01:16:47.338
It's a pretty cold night
in April here, right?

01:16:48.484 --> 01:16:51.317
<i>Americans For Prosperity has</i>
<i>been amazingly effective.</i>

01:16:51.487 --> 01:16:56.424
They're able to organize
that discontent.

01:16:56.625 --> 01:16:59.025
In the name of Al Gore-ism.

01:16:59.194 --> 01:17:03.221
And by the way, can we just talk
about Al Gore for a moment?

01:17:05.434 --> 01:17:09.564
If you see Republicans
becoming sympathetic...

01:17:09.738 --> 01:17:15.267
...to carbon tax, do you view it as
your job to knock those guys out?

01:17:15.444 --> 01:17:17.639
Well, we hold both parties accountable.

01:17:17.780 --> 01:17:20.442
We don't always see eye to eye,
do we, Newt?

01:17:20.649 --> 01:17:25.518
No, but we do agree our country must
take action to address climate change.

01:17:25.688 --> 01:17:29.920
The facts of global warming
demand our urgent attention.

01:17:30.092 --> 01:17:31.787
We have had climate change.

01:17:31.961 --> 01:17:34.452
Clearly, humans have something
to do with it.

01:17:34.663 --> 01:17:37.461
<i>I remember in the mid-2000s,</i>
<i>so many Republicans...</i>

01:17:37.666 --> 01:17:42.194
...they had a lot of the same tenets of faith
that Democrats still many have today.

01:17:42.371 --> 01:17:45.169
Well, I think the risks
of climate change are real.

01:17:45.307 --> 01:17:47.707
I think human activity
is contributing to it.

01:17:47.876 --> 01:17:50.674
Those days are over.
Few Republicans play that game.

01:17:50.813 --> 01:17:52.405
A lot of Democrats bailed too.

01:17:52.581 --> 01:17:55.209
You have Newt Gingrich
at the beginning of '08...

01:17:55.384 --> 01:17:57.682
...on the couch with Nancy Pelosi.

01:17:57.820 --> 01:18:00.880
<i>And by the end of 2008....</i>

01:18:01.056 --> 01:18:03.581
Do you believe
in man-made global warming?

01:18:03.759 --> 01:18:05.249
I don't think we know.

01:18:06.962 --> 01:18:12.923
My view is that we don't know what's
causing climate change on this planet.

01:18:13.102 --> 01:18:18.734
George, the idea that carbon dioxide
is harmful to our environment...

01:18:18.907 --> 01:18:20.807
...is almost comical.

01:18:20.976 --> 01:18:23.774
We've run TV ads
in Republican states...

01:18:23.946 --> 01:18:26.471
...with Republican senators,
like South Carolina.

01:18:28.083 --> 01:18:29.744
Sit down!

01:18:42.131 --> 01:18:44.759
What happened in your election?

01:18:45.467 --> 01:18:46.991
Well, it wasn't even close.

01:18:47.169 --> 01:18:50.832
Bob Inglis ran into a buzz saw
of voter frustration with incumbents.

01:18:51.006 --> 01:18:53.474
<i>Inglis lost every county in the district.</i>

01:18:53.642 --> 01:18:57.009
<i>He is a seasoned congressman</i>
<i>going down to a huge defeat tonight.</i>

01:19:09.992 --> 01:19:14.190
Are we--? Is there not cell phone
reception? Where are we?

01:19:16.031 --> 01:19:17.794
Can you hear me now?

01:19:18.767 --> 01:19:23.466
Did Price brief you on the climate views
of this radio show?

01:19:23.639 --> 01:19:24.663
No.

01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:27.274
All right, well,
we better find that out, huh?

01:19:27.409 --> 01:19:30.071
We can turn on the radio,
see what he's saying.

01:19:44.393 --> 01:19:50.923
We're after-- The target audience
is red-state Republicans.

01:19:51.100 --> 01:19:54.831
And so I think we found some...

01:19:55.003 --> 01:19:57.665
-...in Mississippi.
-<i>From SuperTalk Mississippi....</i>

01:19:57.840 --> 01:20:00.900
Eight-o-two. We go on at 8:08.

01:20:01.076 --> 01:20:05.945
<i>Paul Gallo, a shining example</i>
<i>of the Fairness Doctrine as it should be.</i>

01:20:06.115 --> 01:20:09.516
<i>You think polar bears are in trouble?</i>
<i>No, they're not in trouble.</i>

01:20:09.685 --> 01:20:12.916
<i>In some cases, we've got</i>
<i>more polar bears than we've ever had.</i>

01:20:13.088 --> 01:20:16.683
<i>We got polar-bear problems out there</i>
<i>in some cases.</i>

01:20:23.432 --> 01:20:27.266
Former South Carolina GOP
Representative Bob Inglis...

01:20:27.436 --> 01:20:29.768
...is urging conservatives
to stop denying...

01:20:29.938 --> 01:20:32.532
...humans are contributing
to global warming.

01:20:32.708 --> 01:20:35.233
I don't understand.
How do you come up with this?

01:20:35.410 --> 01:20:39.471
Because to me, every fiber in my body
is saying you're a conservative.

01:20:39.648 --> 01:20:41.946
You can't believe this,
that conservatives--

01:20:42.117 --> 01:20:47.214
You're asking me, as a dyed-in-the-wool
native-born Mississippian...

01:20:47.389 --> 01:20:51.155
...will die here and blessed to do so...

01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:54.921
...to believe that humans are responsible
for global warming...

01:20:55.097 --> 01:20:56.792
...and we must admit that.

01:20:56.965 --> 01:20:58.159
Mic's yours, sir.

01:20:58.367 --> 01:21:01.666
The challenge here is
it's a conversation started by liberals.

01:21:01.870 --> 01:21:05.237
What we're used to, as conservatives,
is they gin up hysteria...

01:21:05.407 --> 01:21:08.672
...and then they drive through regulations
and tax increases...

01:21:08.877 --> 01:21:10.071
...and grow government.

01:21:10.245 --> 01:21:16.241
And so it's natural that we respond
with, "No, we don't wanna do that."

01:21:16.952 --> 01:21:20.012
But what if we had
a different conversation?

01:21:20.189 --> 01:21:21.520
It's all about economics.

01:21:21.690 --> 01:21:25.023
You're taxing something
you want more of, which is income...

01:21:25.194 --> 01:21:30.154
...and you're not taxing something
you maybe want less of, which is CO2.

01:21:30.332 --> 01:21:33.665
Why do we need to be talking
about the global-warming tax again?

01:21:33.835 --> 01:21:37.965
Because if you believe in taking care
of this part of Eden that's left...

01:21:38.140 --> 01:21:41.632
-...and if you believe in creation care--
-Now you're confusing me.

01:21:41.810 --> 01:21:45.610
Now you're saying you do believe
that we are, as humans...

01:21:45.781 --> 01:21:47.214
...creating global warming.

01:21:47.416 --> 01:21:50.908
-We are part-and-parcel responsible.
-Yes.

01:21:51.053 --> 01:21:54.284
I don't believe that humans
are creating this, because--

01:21:54.456 --> 01:22:01.157
And neither do, apparently,
a vast majority of climatologists out there.

01:22:01.697 --> 01:22:03.358
-I was tracking--
-That humans--

01:22:03.532 --> 01:22:07.559
I was tracking with you until that last part.
You're wrong on that last part.

01:22:07.736 --> 01:22:09.931
Good luck to you.
It was good meeting you.

01:22:10.072 --> 01:22:12.040
-Good to talk with you.
-Lots to do...

01:22:12.207 --> 01:22:15.074
...in the final two segments
coming up next.

01:22:15.244 --> 01:22:18.236
<i>Okay, lots to do</i>
<i>in the final two segments....</i>

01:22:18.447 --> 01:22:20.540
-We'll put you down as undecided.
-Sorry?

01:22:20.716 --> 01:22:23.844
-We'll put you down as undecided.
-I don't think so.

01:22:26.054 --> 01:22:28.682
Okay, Perez, we are ready to roll.

01:22:28.857 --> 01:22:32.156
<i>And as for climate change,</i>
<i>we're in the middle of it right now.</i>

01:22:32.327 --> 01:22:34.158
<i>It's called winter into spring.</i>

01:22:34.329 --> 01:22:37.355
<i>For him to say that we need</i>
<i>to change the conversation...</i>

01:22:37.532 --> 01:22:40.968
<i>...is to cave in to these liberals</i>
<i>and their way of thinking.</i>

01:22:41.103 --> 01:22:42.900
<i>When they're wrong, they're wrong.</i>

01:22:43.071 --> 01:22:45.335
I can't take this.
Can we get out of here?

01:22:45.507 --> 01:22:49.273
It's so easy to fall back into the:
"The weather always changes."

01:22:49.478 --> 01:22:51.469
Yeah.

01:22:51.613 --> 01:22:54.605
It's a battleship, Bob.
It takes a while to turn around.

01:22:54.783 --> 01:22:56.341
That's right.

01:23:02.491 --> 01:23:08.191
<i>I mean, it's not just a head thing.</i>
<i>This is very much a heart issue.</i>

01:23:09.498 --> 01:23:12.296
<i>It's not the science that's affecting us.</i>

01:23:12.501 --> 01:23:14.867
I mean, the science is pretty clear.

01:23:15.037 --> 01:23:18.734
It's something else
that's causing this rejection.

01:23:21.777 --> 01:23:25.804
<i>Many conservatives, I think,</i>
<i>see action on climate change...</i>

01:23:26.014 --> 01:23:29.381
<i>...as really an attack on a way of life.</i>

01:23:32.621 --> 01:23:36.216
<i>The reason that we need</i>
<i>the science to be wrong...</i>

01:23:36.391 --> 01:23:41.021
<i>...is otherwise,</i>
<i>we realize that we need to change.</i>

01:23:43.298 --> 01:23:45.789
<i>That's really a hard pill to swallow...</i>

01:23:45.967 --> 01:23:49.459
<i>...that the whole way I've created my life</i>
<i>is wrong, you're saying?</i>

01:23:49.638 --> 01:23:52.106
<i>That I shouldn't have this house</i>
<i>in the suburb?</i>

01:23:52.274 --> 01:23:57.576
<i>I shouldn't be driving this car</i>
<i>that I take my kids to soccer?</i>

01:23:58.413 --> 01:24:02.816
<i>And you're not gonna tell me</i>
<i>to live the way that you want me to live.</i>

01:24:04.152 --> 01:24:06.643
And along comes some people
sowing some doubt...

01:24:06.822 --> 01:24:10.451
...and it's pretty effective
because I'm looking for that answer.

01:24:10.625 --> 01:24:13.685
I want it to be
that the science is not real.

01:24:20.702 --> 01:24:22.829
<i>Top U.S. oil company ExxonMobil...</i>

01:24:23.004 --> 01:24:25.472
<i>...and Russia's Rosneft</i>
<i>have signed a deal...</i>

01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:28.666
<i>...to develop oil and gas reserves</i>
<i>in the Russian Arctic.</i>

01:24:32.381 --> 01:24:35.009
<i>One of the reasons</i>
<i>this deal is now possible...</i>

01:24:35.183 --> 01:24:39.586
...is the human-induced global warming
that has rolled the ice back.

01:24:40.288 --> 01:24:45.783
<i>It's warmer in the Arctic</i>
<i>than it's been in at least 40,000 years.</i>

01:24:45.961 --> 01:24:48.521
<i>And yet there's ExxonMobil</i>
<i>looking at that...</i>

01:24:48.697 --> 01:24:51.791
<i>...thinking they can drill more.</i>

01:24:52.701 --> 01:24:57.638
The very thing they paid groups
to tell us wouldn't happen...

01:24:57.806 --> 01:25:00.104
...has now benefited them.

01:25:00.242 --> 01:25:03.109
We could be into the hundreds
of billions of dollars...

01:25:04.846 --> 01:25:08.612
...over the life of developing
all of the potential prospects up there.

01:25:08.750 --> 01:25:11.719
<i>We now know</i>
<i>they were using climate change...</i>

01:25:11.887 --> 01:25:16.517
<i>...as a source of insight</i>
<i>into exploration.</i>

01:25:18.627 --> 01:25:24.429
<i>There's a point at which you realize</i>
<i>you are part of the losing end of a hustle.</i>

01:25:25.133 --> 01:25:26.896
And it can make you feel very sad.

01:25:27.068 --> 01:25:29.832
And I know many environmentalists
who feel very sad.

01:25:30.005 --> 01:25:32.030
Each of you solemnly swear that....

01:25:33.141 --> 01:25:37.544
<i>But at some point,</i>
<i>the public catches up with you.</i>

01:25:37.712 --> 01:25:40.408
<i>The legal system catches up with you.</i>

01:25:40.582 --> 01:25:44.245
An extraordinary punishment for
the country's big cigarette companies.

01:25:44.419 --> 01:25:46.785
A federal judge said they lied...

01:25:46.955 --> 01:25:51.016
...and they have to take out ads
and admit it publicly.

01:25:51.193 --> 01:25:52.956
<i>Specifically, they have to say...</i>

01:25:53.161 --> 01:25:56.062
<i>...they "deliberately deceived</i>
<i>the American public...</i>

01:25:56.231 --> 01:26:01.692
<i>...about the dangers of cigarettes"</i>
<i>and they designed them to be addictive.</i>

01:26:03.438 --> 01:26:05.770
<i>We know the truth</i>
<i>about the harms of tobacco.</i>

01:26:05.941 --> 01:26:09.775
<i>And the tobacco industry has been</i>
<i>prosecuted for its illegal activities.</i>

01:26:09.945 --> 01:26:12.937
So that's the good news, right?
The truth has come out...

01:26:13.114 --> 01:26:16.242
...and people who deserve
to be punished have been punished.

01:26:16.418 --> 01:26:18.409
The bad news is that it took 50 years.

01:26:20.989 --> 01:26:23.253
<i>If we look at the case</i>
<i>of climate change...</i>

01:26:23.425 --> 01:26:25.620
<i>...we can imagine that eventually...</i>

01:26:25.794 --> 01:26:28.820
<i>...people will come to understand</i>
<i>the scientific evidence.</i>

01:26:28.997 --> 01:26:32.330
<i>But the problem is,</i>
<i>we don't have 50 years.</i>

01:26:34.436 --> 01:26:38.736
<i>Climate change is happening,</i>
<i>it's underway, and it's not reversible.</i>

01:26:40.342 --> 01:26:44.210
<i>As sea level rises and hurricanes</i>
<i>become more intense, people get killed.</i>

01:26:44.346 --> 01:26:46.576
<i>Their houses and communities</i>
<i>get destroyed.</i>

01:26:46.748 --> 01:26:51.515
<i>Think about heat waves and droughts</i>
<i>that ruin agricultural communities.</i>

01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:56.714
<i>These are problems that it will require</i>
<i>government intervention to address.</i>

01:26:59.961 --> 01:27:02.521
<i>The great irony of the story to me...</i>

01:27:02.731 --> 01:27:07.031
<i>...is that people who don't like big</i>
<i>government are going to get more of it.</i>

01:27:08.503 --> 01:27:11.529
<i>And we're gonna see</i>
<i>more money being spent...</i>

01:27:11.740 --> 01:27:15.267
<i>...on dealing with the aftermath</i>
<i>of these disasters.</i>

01:27:17.245 --> 01:27:20.976
<i>There will be billions of dollars</i>
<i>in real-estate losses.</i>

01:27:21.149 --> 01:27:25.347
<i>But more than that, people will die.</i>

01:27:26.454 --> 01:27:28.513
That's why it matters.

01:27:28.690 --> 01:27:30.749
That's why this is meaningful for us...

01:27:30.892 --> 01:27:33.827
...not just for polar bears
or people in Bangladesh.

01:27:37.832 --> 01:27:40.767
<i>That's why so many people</i>
<i>in the scientific community...</i>

01:27:40.902 --> 01:27:43.769
...are really starting to talk
in very worried tones.

01:27:43.905 --> 01:27:46.772
There's a growing sense
in the scientific community...

01:27:46.908 --> 01:27:51.046
...that we're running out of time
to prevent a train wreck.

01:27:54.182 --> 01:27:57.777
<i>Our parents did not know</i>
<i>the things they were doing...</i>

01:27:57.919 --> 01:28:01.821
<i>...were going to have</i>
<i>major consequences for young people...</i>

01:28:01.990 --> 01:28:04.390
<i>...and future generations.</i>

01:28:04.559 --> 01:28:08.586
<i>But we cannot say that.</i>
<i>We can only pretend that we don't know.</i>

01:28:10.365 --> 01:28:13.232
<i>If we warm up the planet</i>
<i>a few degrees...</i>

01:28:13.401 --> 01:28:17.030
<i>...we're talking about eventual</i>
<i>sea-level rise of tens of meters...</i>

01:28:17.205 --> 01:28:20.106
...which would wipe out
all the coastal cities.

01:28:37.325 --> 01:28:40.522
<i>If the ice sheets begin to disintegrate...</i>

01:28:40.695 --> 01:28:44.131
<i>...then by that time,</i>
<i>you've passed a tipping point...</i>

01:28:44.332 --> 01:28:46.459
...so that it's....

01:28:46.635 --> 01:28:50.731
You're going to get consequences
that are out of our control.

01:28:52.474 --> 01:28:55.534
<i>I've been arrested, I think, four times.</i>

01:28:57.345 --> 01:29:00.337
<i>We should be going</i>
<i>and beating on the president's desk...</i>

01:29:00.482 --> 01:29:03.246
<i>...telling him, "We have a problem."</i>

01:29:08.256 --> 01:29:11.248
You don't have to accept things
the way they are.

01:29:11.426 --> 01:29:13.656
There are things we can do to change.

01:29:15.664 --> 01:29:19.259
<i>The lie is that we can't do it,</i>
<i>that we can't innovate.</i>

01:29:19.434 --> 01:29:24.167
<i>We gotta keep relying</i>
<i>on petroleum, coal....</i>

01:29:24.372 --> 01:29:27.170
<i>We gotta have just those things.</i>

01:29:27.375 --> 01:29:29.366
<i>Why?</i>

01:29:30.378 --> 01:29:32.175
To be in this situation...

01:29:32.380 --> 01:29:36.510
...where those fossil fuels
are imperiling our future...

01:29:36.685 --> 01:29:38.744
...and future generations...

01:29:38.920 --> 01:29:43.016
...and we're not accountable for that...

01:29:43.191 --> 01:29:46.490
...that really becomes a moral problem.

01:29:48.830 --> 01:29:51.765
<i>We're leaving our children</i>
<i>and grandchildren a legacy...</i>

01:29:51.933 --> 01:29:54.493
<i>...of people who failed to lead.</i>

01:29:55.003 --> 01:29:59.838
People who, when it came their time
to be awakened...

01:30:00.008 --> 01:30:01.441
...they slept.

01:30:02.711 --> 01:30:07.705
<i>We didn't have enough faith in the future</i>
<i>that could be brought about...</i>

01:30:07.916 --> 01:30:10.009
<i>...so we just gave up.</i>

01:30:11.653 --> 01:30:14.713
<i>We couldn't rise to higher things.</i>

01:30:16.424 --> 01:30:19.552
I don't wanna be a part of that.
I wanna be a part of saying:

01:30:19.728 --> 01:30:23.289
"No, we did rise to it. You bet we did."

01:30:24.305 --> 01:30:30.465
