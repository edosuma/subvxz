01:04.315 --> 01:06.776
- None of that ever happened.
- Ever.

02:55.593 --> 02:57.011
God, dude,
this campus is awesome!

02:57.178 --> 03:00.265
This is friggin' awesome.
Are you looking at this shit?

03:00.431 --> 03:01.975
This is beautiful.

03:02.141 --> 03:03.142
Do you go to school here?

03:03.309 --> 03:05.436
No, I don't go to school here.
I'm too dumb.

03:05.603 --> 03:07.772
But my best friend
from high school goes here.

03:07.939 --> 03:11.025
Yeah, it's his 21st birthday and me
and my friend are going to surprise him.

03:11.192 --> 03:13.903
Foaming.

03:14.070 --> 03:16.865
- Wait, is that a beer?
- What? No. What are you talking about?

03:17.031 --> 03:19.492
Honestly, man, I'm just so
psyched to see my friends, man.

03:19.659 --> 03:21.286
You know what I'm saying?
Here's the train station.

03:21.452 --> 03:22.453
Yeah, dude,
that's him on the corner.

03:22.620 --> 03:24.163
Yeah, can you just honk
your horn a little bit?

03:24.330 --> 03:26.499
Yeah, thanks, man.

03:26.666 --> 03:29.252
Hey, you fucking Jew,
get in the cab!

03:29.419 --> 03:32.338
Dude, he is
such a fucking tool. What is he wearing?

03:32.505 --> 03:35.466
I love him, but, like, he does dress
like a fucking tool.

03:35.633 --> 03:38.011
- Miller! What's up, man?
- Yo, what's up?

03:38.177 --> 03:39.804
- Come on, bring it in, baby.
- How you doing?

03:39.971 --> 03:41.723
- Dude, how you fucking doing, dude?
- Good.

03:41.890 --> 03:43.641
- You look fat.
- What?

03:43.808 --> 03:44.976
- Yeah.
- I mean, I've had midterms.

03:45.143 --> 03:46.436
- I've been stress eating a little bit.
- A little bit?

03:46.603 --> 03:48.271
- A little bit.
- Dude, stop talking about your weight.

03:48.438 --> 03:50.148
- How's Stanford? Good?
- Stanford's great. Honestly.

03:50.315 --> 03:51.858
Actually, yeah,
how's Hakakiqua State?

03:52.025 --> 03:54.652
- It's good, dude, I'm killing it. Yeah.
- Yeah? Kill it! Good.

03:54.819 --> 03:57.572
Dude, how's your family?
And your sister?

03:57.739 --> 03:59.490
- How's your sister?
- My sister? Why are you...?

03:59.657 --> 04:01.951
What? No reason.
I'm just checking in.

04:02.118 --> 04:03.870
You don't have to check in.
She's my sister.

04:04.037 --> 04:05.580
She's 16 years old now.

04:05.747 --> 04:08.875
OK, yeah, she's 16,
but in real life she's, like, 18.

04:09.042 --> 04:11.002
No, in real life she's 16.
That's the whole thing.

04:11.044 --> 04:13.004
And her Facebook photos
are fucking awesome.

04:13.171 --> 04:15.173
Is that Cancun, where does she...?

04:16.173 --> 04:18.843
You know, there's always this moment
right before I see you, where I'm like,

04:19.010 --> 04:20.720
"Why haven't I seen Miller
in so long? It's ridiculous.

04:20.887 --> 04:24.182
We should keep in better touch."
And then I see you and I'm like,

04:24.349 --> 04:26.935
"Oh, yeah, that's right,
he's a fucking idiot."

04:27.101 --> 04:29.312
I'm just kidding, man, come on.

04:29.479 --> 04:30.959
What if I said that
about your sister?

04:31.022 --> 04:33.024
What if I was like, "I wanna fuck
Danielle." What would you say?

04:33.191 --> 04:36.069
Dude, honestly, I would love
for you to fuck my sister.

04:36.235 --> 04:37.695
- Really? Why?
- Yeah.

04:37.862 --> 04:39.530
It would seriously be
an honor to my entire family

04:39.697 --> 04:41.449
- if you fucked my sister.
- What?

04:41.616 --> 04:43.910
I'll bet you five bucks that I fuck
your sister before you fuck my sister.

04:44.077 --> 04:47.080
I bet you five bucks that I fuck
my sister before you fuck my sister.

04:47.246 --> 04:49.666
I'll give you five bucks
if you fuck your sister.

04:49.832 --> 04:52.418
OK, can we cool it
with the sister fucking?

04:53.461 --> 04:55.546
This is your friend's place, all right?
Get out.

04:55.713 --> 04:58.841
Oh, great. This is awesome.

04:59.008 --> 05:01.302
- Jesus Christ, this place is quaint.
- Thank you.

05:01.469 --> 05:04.889
- I don't know.
- Jesus! Who is that guy?

05:06.224 --> 05:08.559
He's kind of a good dancer.

05:11.521 --> 05:13.731
What's up, VisionQuest? Boom.

05:13.898 --> 05:16.901
Dude, if we're not as fucked up as
that guy in two hours, we have failed.

05:17.068 --> 05:18.788
I'd definitely wash
that hand if I were you.

05:18.820 --> 05:20.460
Did you see the headdress?
He's The Chief.

05:20.488 --> 05:21.728
No, he's a street person, dude.

05:25.326 --> 05:27.704
Nice tie. You look like
Jason Gordon-Levitz.

05:27.870 --> 05:30.915
It's actually
Joseph Gordon-Levitt.

05:31.082 --> 05:32.834
I actually really like him
in 500 Days <i>of</i> Summer.

05:33.001 --> 05:34.752
- He's actually a really good actor.
- He is a really good actor.

05:34.919 --> 05:36.504
Had a nice little
transitional period, right?

05:36.671 --> 05:38.191
- <i>Third City from the Sun</i> or...
- Yeah.

05:38.214 --> 05:39.632
- Jeff Chang!
- Hey!

05:39.799 --> 05:41.467
Yeah! What's up, bud?

05:41.634 --> 05:43.720
Happy birthday,
you tiny yellow son of a bitch!

05:43.886 --> 05:45.930
- Surprise, buddy!
- What are you guys doing here?

05:46.097 --> 05:48.099
I want you to call your lame
friends and cancel your plans

05:48.266 --> 05:51.227
because we're taking you out tonight
and melt your fucking face off!

05:51.394 --> 05:53.813
- Yes. Yes, we are!
- No. Wait, no, no, wait!

05:53.980 --> 05:56.315
- Your face will be fine.
- Guys! Miller, I'm not...

05:56.482 --> 05:57.442
- Yeah, dude.
- Yeah!

05:57.608 --> 05:59.861
- No, no, hey, guys.
- Man, nice place!

06:00.028 --> 06:01.738
- Guys, guys, guys, listen to me.
- What?

06:01.904 --> 06:04.490
I really appreciate you coming
all the way down here, but...

06:04.657 --> 06:05.992
Do you have any weed?
I smoked all mine on the train.

06:06.159 --> 06:07.910
No, no. Seriously,
I can't go out tonight.

06:08.077 --> 06:10.872
OK? I have my biggest med school
interview, ever, tomorrow morning.

06:11.039 --> 06:12.915
Shit! We should've called.

06:13.082 --> 06:16.836
Jeff Chang! You're 21 years old, man.
Your asshole dad isn't here anymore.

06:17.003 --> 06:19.255
- Gentlemen.
- Holy fuck, he is totally here.

06:19.422 --> 06:22.550
Nice to see you again,
Dr. Chang. How's Cathy?

06:22.717 --> 06:25.720
I mean, Mrs. Chang?
I mean, Dr. Mrs. Chang? Fuck me.

06:25.887 --> 06:29.891
You still owe me $17.50
for that hole in my fence, Altman.

06:30.058 --> 06:32.101
Really? That was from,
like, eighth grade.

06:34.312 --> 06:37.565
I didn't know you still
associated with these... people.

06:37.732 --> 06:40.276
No, Dad, I swear,
I didn't know they were coming.

06:40.443 --> 06:43.780
Your interview with Dr. Collins
is at 8:00 a.m. tomorrow morning.

06:43.946 --> 06:45.114
I'll pick you up at seven.

06:45.281 --> 06:47.116
- Your suit is pressed?
- Yeah.

06:47.283 --> 06:50.578
I had to call in a lot of favors
to get you this interview.

06:50.745 --> 06:54.415
Be rested, be sharp,
do not embarrass me.

06:54.582 --> 06:56.292
I won't.

06:58.753 --> 07:00.546
Dick wads.

07:04.342 --> 07:06.969
Look, it was so nice
of you guys to surprise me,

07:07.136 --> 07:09.013
but, listen, I can't go out tonight, OK?

07:09.180 --> 07:10.900
This is like my whole life
in one interview.

07:10.973 --> 07:13.559
- Dude, I totally get it.
- That's funny 'cause I don't.

07:13.726 --> 07:15.561
- I don't totally get it.
- Could we go out tomorrow night?

07:15.728 --> 07:18.022
No, we cannot go out tomorrow night,
because I've got tickets to Soundgarden.

07:18.189 --> 07:19.857
You're a straight-A student, dude.
You can go out one night.

07:20.024 --> 07:21.192
He can't go out, dude.

07:21.359 --> 07:22.860
Casey, first of all,
you need to shut the fuck up.

07:23.027 --> 07:24.487
- And Jeff Chang, you need to sit down.
- No.

07:24.654 --> 07:28.366
Come on, just take a seat,
please, on your nice futon.

07:28.533 --> 07:30.774
Because you have the wrong
attitude right now, my friend.

07:30.868 --> 07:32.995
Look, Jeff Chang,
this isn't just any birthday.

07:33.162 --> 07:34.789
OK? This is your 21st birthday.

07:34.956 --> 07:37.500
- Here we go.
- This is the day that you become a man.

07:37.667 --> 07:40.878
This is the day that you get to tell
every bouncer who's ever carded you,

07:41.045 --> 07:44.632
"You know what? Sure, I get it. Yes, I
look like a nine-year-old Chinese girl."

07:44.799 --> 07:46.217
- What the fuck?
- "But guess what?"

07:46.384 --> 07:48.386
Today is my 21st fucking birthday."

07:48.553 --> 07:50.847
So, step aside
and let the man come through.

07:51.013 --> 07:52.849
Miller, I totally get it,
but I can't go out tonight.

07:53.015 --> 07:55.393
It's actually not your fault.
It's your people's fault.

07:55.560 --> 07:58.312
Your people haven't been in this
country for a very "rong" time.

07:58.479 --> 08:01.691
- What? He's more American than you.
- My family built the rail roads.

08:01.858 --> 08:04.110
Yeah, but, well, you know
what I mean. Like, your people.

08:04.277 --> 08:06.737
- What? What?
- China. I don't know. Are you Chinese?

08:06.904 --> 08:08.573
- Listen, the point is...
- I understand what you're saying,

08:08.739 --> 08:10.116
- but I can't...
- In America,

08:10.283 --> 08:13.077
in the United States of America,
bald eagles and Budweiser,

08:13.244 --> 08:16.038
you go out and drink because
it's a sacred rite of passage.

08:16.205 --> 08:17.915
- It's just like in Africa when...
- Oh, my God.

08:18.082 --> 08:19.709
If we were in Africa...
You are so lucky we're not in Africa.

08:19.876 --> 08:21.460
If we were in Africa, you would
have to leave the village

08:21.627 --> 08:22.795
and not come back
till you killed a bear.

08:22.962 --> 08:24.088
None of that is true.

08:24.255 --> 08:26.340
- There's no bears in Africa? Really?
- No.

08:26.507 --> 08:28.593
- You have to read a book.
- You're 21 years old.

08:28.759 --> 08:32.263
This, as they say in Casey's
home country, is a bar mitzvah.

08:32.429 --> 08:34.671
- It's the American bar mitzvah.
- I was born in America.

08:34.807 --> 08:37.768
It's like... OK, it's like when an
Eskimo kills his first penguin, right?

08:37.934 --> 08:40.655
- Nope, they definitely don't do that.
- Yes, they fucking do, Casey.

08:40.688 --> 08:43.107
- I hate you.
- In this country, Jeff Chang,

08:43.274 --> 08:45.860
your best friends take you out
and they fuck you with alcohol.

08:46.027 --> 08:48.738
- I'm gonna fuck you with alcohol.
- Oh, my God.

08:48.905 --> 08:50.907
- Now who's with me?
- Nope.

08:51.073 --> 08:52.825
Come on, fuckers!

08:52.992 --> 08:53.951
Whatever.

08:54.118 --> 08:55.870
I'm fucking taking you out
whether you want to or not!

08:56.037 --> 08:57.663
I don't care if you're
scared of your fucking dad.

08:57.830 --> 08:59.207
Dude, we're all scared
of his fucking dad.

08:59.373 --> 09:01.375
I'm not! A little bit.

09:01.542 --> 09:03.502
Also, if you do not
come out tonight,

09:03.669 --> 09:06.109
I will stand outside your
bedroom window all night doing this.

09:07.882 --> 09:09.683
- OK, OK, OK, I'll go out!
- I can't hear you!

09:09.800 --> 09:12.386
- This thing is super loud!
- I'll go out, just stop! Just stop!

09:12.553 --> 09:15.056
That's what I'm saying.
That wasn't so hard.

09:15.223 --> 09:17.808
What kind of asshole brings
an air horn in his backpack?

09:17.975 --> 09:19.310
Honestly, it comes in handy
more than you'd think.

09:19.477 --> 09:22.063
- Just one beer. One beer.
- That's all I wanted.

09:22.230 --> 09:23.439
- We'll take care of you.
- That's it, man.

09:23.606 --> 09:26.006
Nothing's gonna happen to you.
You're my little baby tonight.

09:26.150 --> 09:29.695
<i>♪ You may bury me with an enemy
in Mount Calvary!</i>

09:29.862 --> 09:33.824
<i>♪ You can stack me on a pyre
and soak me down with whiskey</i>

09:33.991 --> 09:35.534
<i>♪ Roast me to a blackened crisp</i>

09:35.701 --> 09:37.286
<i>- Give me a shot!
- ♪ And throw me in a pyre!</i>

09:37.453 --> 09:40.665
<i>♪ I don't really give a shit
I'm going out in style! ♪</i>

09:42.124 --> 09:45.544
I'm gonna be 21 forever,
you motherfuckers!

09:50.299 --> 09:52.551
- Dude! How you doing?
- I'm doing great, dude.

09:52.718 --> 09:54.358
- Good to see you guys!
- What's up, dude?

09:54.512 --> 09:57.139
It's awesome to see you. Honestly,
'cause I miss you. I miss your hugs.

09:57.306 --> 09:59.350
- Yeah. OK. OK.
- Give me a hug.

09:59.517 --> 10:03.271
Are you... are you...
Are you sure you're OK, man?

10:03.437 --> 10:05.481
You're fine, like,
should we maybe get going?

10:05.648 --> 10:07.441
No, Casey, look at me. I'm fine.

10:07.608 --> 10:08.943
- I'm fine.
- You look fine.

10:09.110 --> 10:10.319
- I'm fine.
- He's fine.

10:10.486 --> 10:12.363
- You know what this bar reminds me of?
- What?

10:12.530 --> 10:15.449
The night we won Rothenberg's
Beer Pong tournament, and Jeff Chang

10:15.616 --> 10:17.827
hooked up with that nine-foot tall
chick who played the banjo.

10:17.994 --> 10:19.315
- Yeah, what was her name?
- Tara.

10:19.328 --> 10:20.496
- Tara!
- Yeah, Tara!

10:20.663 --> 10:22.039
She was gigantic.

10:22.206 --> 10:24.125
Man, high school was so awesome.

10:24.292 --> 10:26.133
Speaking of the banjo,
you still writing music?

10:26.168 --> 10:29.463
Dude, I'm pre-med, man. I don't
write music. I don't listen to music.

10:29.630 --> 10:31.507
I can't even remember
the last time I went to a show.

10:31.674 --> 10:33.217
- Fuck, man.
- Yeah.

10:33.384 --> 10:35.553
Hey, you're still in for Sidewinder
at The Gorge this summer, right?

10:35.720 --> 10:38.389
- Hell, yeah! The Gorge!
- Right, OK! The Gorge!

10:38.556 --> 10:39.932
Casey, what about you, man?

10:40.099 --> 10:42.601
- The Gorge, Sidewinder.
- I don't know, man.

10:42.768 --> 10:46.522
Aren't we too old to be doing
the whole music festival thing?

10:46.689 --> 10:48.524
I don't know, Casey, are
we too old to have fun times?

10:48.691 --> 10:50.359
- No.
- Are we too old to spend a week

10:50.526 --> 10:52.903
enjoying 250 bands play
the seminal music of our generation?

10:53.070 --> 10:55.698
Are we too old to drop acid and make
love to white chicks in dreadlocks?

10:55.865 --> 10:57.865
- I don't like dreadlocks.
- Are we too old to take

10:57.867 --> 11:00.077
handfuls of Ecstasy and dance around
in fur... with other people in fur?

11:00.244 --> 11:02.121
Yeah, we are too old
for all of those things.

11:02.288 --> 11:03.289
I don't like dreadlocks.

11:03.456 --> 11:05.976
But, guys, all I'm saying is
that we all graduate in May, right?

11:06.125 --> 11:09.628
This could be the last summer all three
of us ever spend together. You know?

11:11.130 --> 11:14.258
Right, but I have a job
lined up after graduation.

11:15.217 --> 11:16.677
- What?
- You got a fucking job?

11:16.844 --> 11:20.890
Yeah. I'm working for
Newbury Capital in New York.

11:21.057 --> 11:23.851
- Dude, congrats, that's a great firm!
- Thanks, Jeff Chang. See?

11:24.018 --> 11:26.395
Yeah, awesome. What about Sidewinder
at The Gorge, Casey?

11:26.562 --> 11:28.105
I'll think about it, all right?
That's all I'm saying.

11:28.272 --> 11:31.650
- Yeah. You're selfish. That's bullshit.
- Jeff! Jeff!

11:31.817 --> 11:34.153
- Oh, Nicole!
- Holy shit, game on.

11:34.320 --> 11:36.572
- Hey, how are you doing?
- Happy birthday!

11:36.739 --> 11:38.824
Hey. Meet my oldest friends,
Miller, Casey.

11:38.991 --> 11:40.534
We used to tear shit up
in high school.

11:40.701 --> 11:42.495
Casey.
Nice to meet you, Nicole.

11:42.661 --> 11:44.413
That's quite a firm shake.

11:44.580 --> 11:46.123
That's 'cause he masturbates a lot.

11:46.290 --> 11:49.126
Oh, yeah? Me too. I can't get to sleep
without flicking the bean.

11:49.293 --> 11:53.714
What? I guess we already
have a lot in common. That's great.

11:53.881 --> 11:55.508
Yeah, I masturbate a lot, too.

11:55.674 --> 11:57.134
- He does.
- Like a lot.

11:57.301 --> 12:00.096
At weird places too, like malls,

12:00.262 --> 12:02.223
bathrooms, handicap stalls.
They're bigger.

12:02.390 --> 12:04.150
Name some more spots
you jerk off in, Miller.

12:04.183 --> 12:06.185
Sometimes I wear flannel.
Made me feel like a lumberjack.

12:06.352 --> 12:08.646
- What the fuck?
- I am so sorry for him.

12:08.813 --> 12:10.648
I don't even know you.
I feel terrible.

12:10.815 --> 12:12.900
What are you talking about? I feel like
she's picking up what I'm putting down.

12:13.067 --> 12:14.151
Yeah, but then again,

12:14.318 --> 12:17.029
- she's putting it down again.
- But then she picks it back up.

12:17.196 --> 12:19.198
I feel like she'd never
really pick it up twice.

12:19.365 --> 12:22.034
OK, look, I'm just gonna ask.
Who would you rather...?

12:22.201 --> 12:24.036
- Him.
- Oh, my God.

12:24.203 --> 12:26.122
- OK, it's over. It's over.
- Oh, my God.

12:26.288 --> 12:27.915
- This is embarrassing.
- That's fine, that's fine.

12:28.082 --> 12:29.917
Fuck you all, I'm gonna
go play some darts.

12:30.084 --> 12:32.336
Have a really boring life
with my boring friend Casey,

12:32.503 --> 12:34.463
who played the flute in band.

12:34.630 --> 12:36.757
OK, thanks, buddy. Enjoy.

12:36.924 --> 12:39.135
Thank you for that. My God.

12:39.301 --> 12:41.512
- Here, sit down.
- You're welcome. Thank you.

12:41.679 --> 12:44.348
So... So, that's your friend?

12:44.515 --> 12:46.356
Yeah, we were best friends
back in high school,

12:46.517 --> 12:48.269
but we're not really that close anymore.

12:48.436 --> 12:51.036
Yeah. Your oldest friends are always
your weirdest friends, right?

12:51.147 --> 12:53.441
- Yeah, what is that about?
- I don't know.

12:53.607 --> 12:55.609
People change when
they go to college, right?

12:55.776 --> 12:58.654
Like, I'm sure he wasn't that
big of an idiot back in high school.

13:00.030 --> 13:02.470
No, actually, that's exactly
how big of an idiot he was, yeah.

13:02.616 --> 13:04.910
- Hundred percent same amount of idiot.
- Really? OK.

13:05.077 --> 13:09.498
Yeah. So you're in,
Sigma... Zeta...

13:09.665 --> 13:11.500
- ...circle with a line in it.
- Oh, OK.

13:11.667 --> 13:13.252
- I get it, you're not in a frat?
- No.

13:13.419 --> 13:17.089
'Cause I'm not angry and secretly gay.

13:17.256 --> 13:18.424
So, what are you drinking?

13:24.054 --> 13:26.807
Oh, dude, I'm so glad you guys came.
I really needed this.

13:26.974 --> 13:28.934
- My dad's been driving me crazy.
- Yeah man, we love you.

13:29.101 --> 13:31.896
- We wouldn't miss it for anything.
- Miller!

13:32.062 --> 13:34.502
Honestly, I'm sorry Casey's
being such a little bitch, though.

13:34.523 --> 13:36.066
- He's not being a bitch.
- Dude, yeah, he is.

13:36.233 --> 13:38.235
Honestly, I feel like he thinks that
he's too good for us and it's like,

13:38.402 --> 13:39.570
"Bro, you're a nerd."

13:39.737 --> 13:41.405
He's not a nerd.
He's our friend.

13:41.572 --> 13:43.199
You're lucky to be hanging out
with us because we're awesome.

13:43.365 --> 13:45.159
Dude, he's just trying to be happy.

13:45.326 --> 13:47.620
So, you leave for Brazil tomorrow?

13:47.786 --> 13:51.582
Yes, and then Chile,
Ecuador and Argentina.

13:51.749 --> 13:53.542
What about you? What are
you doing for spring break?

13:53.709 --> 13:56.212
I have a two week externship
at J.P. Morgan.

13:56.378 --> 13:58.172
It's private equity stuff.
It's pretty cool.

13:59.173 --> 14:02.343
- You know? It's not that cool.
- Wait.

14:02.510 --> 14:07.139
So, on the last spring break
of your entire life, you're working?

14:07.306 --> 14:09.558
Yeah, why? Aren't we supposed
to be starting our lives?

14:09.725 --> 14:12.186
- Did your mom tell you that?
- Yeah, my mom did tell me that.

14:12.353 --> 14:14.271
- She did?
- Yeah. Why you hating on my mama?

14:14.438 --> 14:17.066
No, it's just...
I mean, look around. OK?

14:17.233 --> 14:19.318
In ten years, everyone in this
bar will be married with kids,

14:19.485 --> 14:23.072
driving to some boring job
in a fucking minivan.

14:23.239 --> 14:26.242
I mean, we got to do as much
crazy shit as we can before then.

14:26.951 --> 14:29.078
No, yeah, exactly.
I totally agree.

14:31.038 --> 14:32.831
We're not too big on crazy here,
are we?

14:32.998 --> 14:36.168
What? No, I'm a huge
proponent of the crazy.

14:36.335 --> 14:38.095
Are you kidding?
I'm the mayor of Crazyville.

14:38.254 --> 14:40.965
- Oh, my God, you're such a dork.
- No! Are you...?

14:41.131 --> 14:45.427
What? Check it. Look, V-neck
sweater with an un-tucked shirt.

14:45.594 --> 14:48.138
My shit is bananas, girl.

14:48.305 --> 14:51.559
I'm just saying, the point is, is that

14:51.725 --> 14:53.852
he's changed and I can tell
that you're upset by it.

14:54.019 --> 14:55.396
- I'm not upset. I'm not.
- Yeah, you are.

14:55.563 --> 14:57.690
OK, whatever, message received.
I'm gonna talk to him.

14:57.856 --> 14:59.400
- Dude, no.
- This can't go on. He's hurting you.

14:59.567 --> 15:01.443
- He's hurting both of us.
- You don't need to talk to him.

15:01.610 --> 15:03.320
Holy shit, dude!

15:03.487 --> 15:04.822
- Fuck me!
- That's awesome.

15:04.989 --> 15:06.323
It went all the way through.
I can see it.

15:06.490 --> 15:08.867
Oh, my God. Hey, hey...
Oh, my God, I am so sorry, man.

15:09.034 --> 15:10.953
- I'm so sorry.
- Problem, homeboy?

15:11.120 --> 15:13.289
- No, no. Here, let me take a look.
- Get your hands off me!

15:13.455 --> 15:14.915
I'm gonna be a medical student.
I'll just check...

15:15.082 --> 15:16.163
- Back off!
- Hey, hey, hey!

15:16.250 --> 15:18.711
- Step Up, 3D. Take a step back.
- Miller, help me.

15:18.877 --> 15:21.463
- You want to fight?
- Calm down. Nobody wants to dance, OK?

15:21.630 --> 15:23.716
- It was an accident.
- Sorry, we won't touch you.

15:23.882 --> 15:25.009
It was an accident.

15:25.175 --> 15:29.513
Oh, well, guys, I guess
it was just an accident.

15:29.680 --> 15:31.515
You know, my face
doesn't even hurt anymore,

15:31.682 --> 15:33.601
now that I know that
it's an accident.

15:33.767 --> 15:36.353
I mean, accidents, they happen
all the time when you're drinking.

15:36.520 --> 15:38.280
People get hit by things
like flying darts...

15:38.314 --> 15:40.024
- What's happening?
- ...and flying stools.

15:40.190 --> 15:42.234
What are you doing with the bar stool?
What, you're gonna throw it at us?

15:42.401 --> 15:44.820
Jesus Christ, man! Are you OK?

15:44.987 --> 15:47.197
Now if I ever see
you fucking tampons again,

15:47.364 --> 15:49.617
I will come at you like
a fucking spider monkey!

15:49.783 --> 15:51.785
I'll rip your face off, bitch.

15:51.952 --> 15:53.370
I think we should
get the fuck out of here.

15:53.537 --> 15:55.456
- Yeah, let's get the fuck out of here.
- Let's get the fuck out of here.

15:55.623 --> 15:58.250
You seriously need to get laid.

15:58.417 --> 16:00.210
I know, what do you think
I'm trying to do right now?

16:00.377 --> 16:02.880
- Oh, really, is that what this is?
- Yeah.

16:03.047 --> 16:05.341
Why, how am I doing? Is it not...

16:05.507 --> 16:07.384
Do you have any, like,
notes or comments or anything?

16:07.551 --> 16:08.510
We gotta go.

16:08.677 --> 16:10.137
What? No, I'm talking to Nicole.

16:10.304 --> 16:11.555
That's a really great story.
We gotta go.

16:11.722 --> 16:12.803
- Yeah.
- No, I'm not going.

16:12.931 --> 16:14.171
We need to get out of this bar.

16:23.192 --> 16:25.033
OK, what could have
possibly went down in there

16:25.152 --> 16:26.487
that you had to pull me away from her?

16:26.654 --> 16:29.365
What? Dude, that wasn't gonna happen.
She's a hard nine, you are a soft six.

16:29.531 --> 16:31.992
What the fuck, man?

16:32.159 --> 16:34.411
- Shit.
- OK, where we going? Let's go.

16:34.578 --> 16:36.914
No, man, it's eleven o'clock.
We're done.

16:37.081 --> 16:39.041
OK. OK.

16:39.708 --> 16:41.835
Oh, dude, there's like 20 bars nearby.
That's awesome. Let's do it.

16:42.002 --> 16:45.923
No, we gotta get Jeff Chang home, man.
His dad is gonna fucking flip.

16:46.090 --> 16:48.842
What are you? A pussy?

16:49.009 --> 16:50.844
- That's awesome.
- You fucking pussy!

16:51.011 --> 16:52.346
How many fuckin' shots
did you give him in there?

16:52.513 --> 16:54.598
Relax, OK? He drank us both
under the table in high school.

16:54.765 --> 16:56.767
- Yeah, I remember.
- Oh, shit, the Galway.

16:56.934 --> 16:58.694
These fuckers have been
carding me for years.

16:58.769 --> 17:01.271
Jeff Chang! Car!

17:01.438 --> 17:03.607
- Fuckers!
- What the hell? Where is he going?

17:03.774 --> 17:05.818
All right, dude, relax, one more bar
and then we'll go home. I promise.

17:05.983 --> 17:09.279
- All right. She was cute, right?
- Yeah, she was cute.

17:09.445 --> 17:11.031
- She's just not my type.
- What is your type?

17:11.198 --> 17:12.616
Girls that wanna
have sex with me.

17:13.826 --> 17:15.536
- ID?
- On.

17:15.703 --> 17:18.664
You got ID or not, man? Just
come back when you hit puberty.

17:19.330 --> 17:22.584
Twenty-one. Blackjack,
motherfucker!

17:22.751 --> 17:24.044
- Whatever, just go the fuck inside.
- What?

17:24.211 --> 17:26.505
- What? What?
- You're good, go in.

17:26.672 --> 17:28.507
Where are the white women at?

18:25.314 --> 18:27.566
Drink, drink, drink, drink!

18:43.248 --> 18:45.125
Yeah!

18:45.292 --> 18:47.503
Take it off, yeah!

18:52.382 --> 18:54.259
Oh, my God!

18:59.056 --> 19:01.558
Holy shit, dude! Stop pissing!
Stop pissing! Stop it!

19:01.725 --> 19:03.018
What the hell are you doing?

19:05.437 --> 19:07.064
I'll just talk to myself.
Awesome.

19:07.606 --> 19:08.899
Man, this is ridiculous.

19:13.862 --> 19:15.364
Miller, we have to get him home.

19:15.531 --> 19:18.200
- Three waters, please.
- Dude, it's too late.

19:48.897 --> 19:51.692
- They're gonna need a new bull.
- This is not funny.

19:51.859 --> 19:53.902
Yeah, let's put him down.
He's really heavy.

19:54.403 --> 19:55.487
Oh, my God.

19:55.654 --> 19:57.948
Jeff Chang's dad is gonna
fucking honor kill him

19:58.115 --> 19:59.283
if we don't get him
to that interview.

19:59.449 --> 20:02.077
Relax, he's gonna be fine, man.
Let's just get him home.

20:11.128 --> 20:12.170
Yeah, so where are we?

20:14.172 --> 20:16.717
How do I feel like
none of this looks familiar?

20:16.884 --> 20:18.135
Did we come from...?

20:19.469 --> 20:21.638
Jeff Chang, where do you live?

20:23.181 --> 20:26.602
- Home...
- Yeah, home, how do we get home, bud?

20:28.979 --> 20:31.857
- Suck my shit.
- OK, hey, hey.

20:32.024 --> 20:34.785
Get you home, we can get you rested.
Just give us your address, buddy.

20:34.943 --> 20:36.987
We'll get you a good night's sleep,
a nice cup of coffee.

20:37.154 --> 20:38.572
Dude, that's not gonna work.
You gotta shake him.

20:38.739 --> 20:40.073
- What?
- Wake up, asshole!

20:40.240 --> 20:41.880
- Tell us where you live.
- Didn't you...?

20:41.909 --> 20:44.786
I know that you're in there
and I know that you can hear me.

20:44.953 --> 20:47.497
- Didn't you have his address?
- Yeah, I do...

20:47.664 --> 20:49.207
It's back at his apartment, though.

20:49.374 --> 20:50.626
All right, well,
maybe it's in his wallet?

20:50.792 --> 20:54.254
Yeah, check his wallet.
He's really passed out, man.

20:54.421 --> 20:56.965
No, that's his parents' address.
I know that one. Fuck!

20:57.674 --> 21:00.052
- Yeah, let's call his parents.
- Yeah, let's.

21:00.218 --> 21:03.388
Let's call Dr. Chang, the scariest man
in the entire world, and be like,

21:03.555 --> 21:05.474
"Hey, what's going on,
Dr. Chang?"

21:05.641 --> 21:07.351
We took your son out,
got him shitfaced

21:07.517 --> 21:09.561
"and totally ruined his future.
Oops. Sorry."

21:09.728 --> 21:12.009
OK, look, Casey, we don't know
where Jeff Chang lives. OK?

21:12.022 --> 21:13.690
We don't know anybody who knows
where Jeff Chang lives,

21:13.857 --> 21:15.901
- so it seems like...
- Wait. Oh, my God. Nicole.

21:16.068 --> 21:17.235
Dude, stop thinking
with your penis.

21:17.402 --> 21:19.988
No, no, no. Nicole,
she's friends with Jeff Chang.

21:20.155 --> 21:22.658
- She might know where he lives.
- OK, cool. Did you get her number?

21:22.824 --> 21:24.660
- No.
- No, because you can't close.

21:24.826 --> 21:26.620
No, because you pulled me away
from her before I fucking could.

21:26.787 --> 21:28.455
- You know that.
- You could never close.

21:28.622 --> 21:31.208
She was closeable. I would've closed.
Jeff Chang could've closed.

21:31.375 --> 21:32.626
You know what?
Nicole lives in a sorority.

21:32.793 --> 21:35.504
If we could find her sorority house,
we could find her.

21:35.671 --> 21:38.423
OK, Casey, there's 40,000
people at this university.

21:38.590 --> 21:41.051
There is no way that I'm gonna
go looking for one person,

21:41.218 --> 21:42.970
who may or may not
know where he lives.

21:43.136 --> 21:45.973
That is dumb. No. No.

21:46.139 --> 21:48.100
"No." No, never.

22:01.822 --> 22:02.906
Oh, hey, it's The Chief.

22:03.073 --> 22:05.617
Dude, what is The Chief doing
all the way over here?

22:05.784 --> 22:07.786
- I wish I was homeless.
- Oh, my God.

22:07.953 --> 22:11.039
Think about it, man, they got no stress.
They have no responsibilities.

22:11.206 --> 22:12.958
What responsibilities
do you have?

22:13.125 --> 22:15.252
Dude, I have a cat that
needs love and affection

22:15.419 --> 22:17.254
and I have to take her on walks.

22:17.421 --> 22:21.091
- You don't take cats on walks.
- I take my cat on walks.

22:21.258 --> 22:22.884
She has fat legs.

22:27.681 --> 22:29.349
Dude, I really don't
want to fuck this up.

22:29.516 --> 22:31.768
Jeff Chang has wanted to be
a doctor his whole life.

22:31.935 --> 22:33.103
Maybe he should've
thought about that

22:33.270 --> 22:34.312
before he went out drinking tonight.

22:34.479 --> 22:37.774
- Yeah, 'cause this is all his fault.
- What is that supposed to mean?

22:37.941 --> 22:39.985
You forced him to go out
and made him get drunk.

22:40.152 --> 22:42.272
Jeff Chang is a grown man
and he made his own choices.

22:42.362 --> 22:43.739
There was no air horn
involved anywhere?

22:43.905 --> 22:45.115
Nope.

22:45.282 --> 22:47.743
Great. Seems like you haven't
changed at all, that's nice.

22:47.909 --> 22:50.120
Yeah, well, you've changed
because in high school,

22:50.287 --> 22:51.788
- you were sorta cool, Casey.
- What is this jabbing my leg?

22:51.955 --> 22:55.250
But now, you are not cool.
Now you're just super douchey.

22:55.417 --> 22:57.294
- What the fuck?
- Holy shit.

22:57.461 --> 22:59.781
- What is Jeff Chang doing with a gun?
- I don't know, man.

23:00.464 --> 23:01.757
Take him.

23:03.008 --> 23:04.968
- Dude, this is a real gun, man.
- I know.

23:05.135 --> 23:07.804
I got it.
He's on the riflery team, right?

23:08.680 --> 23:11.683
You think this guy's OK?
He didn't say anything to you, did he?

23:11.850 --> 23:13.060
No one's trying
to hurt him or anything?

23:13.226 --> 23:15.562
No. But we don't talk as much
as we used to. You know?

23:17.147 --> 23:19.399
All right, let's just
keep going, I guess, right?

23:19.566 --> 23:22.086
I want to shoot something
if I have this fucking gun in my hand.

23:22.110 --> 23:24.230
- Please don't. Please don't.
- Can I kill a squirrel?

23:24.362 --> 23:26.990
- Miller, put the fucking gun away.
- OK.

23:27.157 --> 23:29.534
- Let's go.
- I'll kill one later.

23:37.793 --> 23:41.338
- So, what sorority is Nicole in?
- Sigma Zeta something.

23:41.505 --> 23:43.215
Dude, her sorority letters
were written on her rack.

23:43.381 --> 23:44.633
How do you not remember them?

23:44.800 --> 23:46.426
I was more interested
in what she had to say, dude.

23:46.593 --> 23:47.886
Yeah, well, if you
had been a normal guy

23:48.053 --> 23:49.813
and stared at her tits,
we'd be home already.

23:50.055 --> 23:53.183
- Speaking of tits, how is your sister?
- Oh, my God.

23:53.350 --> 23:54.851
Sigma Zeta Theta,
could that be it?

23:55.018 --> 23:56.520
Yeah, that's actually right.

23:57.354 --> 23:59.606
Vaginas!

23:59.773 --> 24:01.274
Yeah, you wanna tell us
where you live, man?

24:01.441 --> 24:02.859
Big vagina.

24:03.026 --> 24:06.196
OK. Let's just lock that away for
a few minutes and act normal, OK?

24:06.363 --> 24:09.491
- Oh, hello!
- Hello. How are you?

24:09.658 --> 24:11.243
- Hi.
- Hi.

24:12.202 --> 24:14.830
Awesome. Is Nicole in?

24:16.039 --> 24:17.374
Is this some sort of
pledge thing?

24:17.541 --> 24:20.502
- I want cereal. Count Chocula.
- Jeff Chang.

24:20.669 --> 24:22.337
- All right.
- You don't have to write.

24:22.504 --> 24:24.047
The answer is...

24:24.214 --> 24:26.633
Oh, no, don't even worry about it.
Just tell Nicole to come downstairs.

24:26.800 --> 24:27.968
Just tell her it's Casey.

24:28.135 --> 24:31.179
It's a funny story, actually.
She'll totally love this.

24:31.346 --> 24:33.056
Fuck! Well, what are
we gonna do now, man?

24:33.223 --> 24:34.349
That was so weird.

24:34.516 --> 24:35.809
Hold him.

24:37.769 --> 24:40.981
- What are you doing?
- Come on.

24:41.148 --> 24:43.233
- Don't leave me with the baby.
- Bring the baby. Come on.

24:43.400 --> 24:45.402
- I can't... fuckin'...
- Let's go around the back.

24:46.820 --> 24:48.029
Motherfucker.

24:48.196 --> 24:52.159
Hey. Dude, no, we're not
breaking into a sorority.

24:52.325 --> 24:54.411
Don't be scared. They're just girls.

24:56.037 --> 24:57.706
Oh, jackpot. Yes.

24:57.873 --> 25:00.375
What? Do you have a better idea?

25:01.668 --> 25:04.254
- Come on.
- I fucking hate you.

25:05.630 --> 25:07.090
Watch his head. Watch his head.

25:07.257 --> 25:09.259
It's gonna be fine,
everything's gonna be fine.

25:11.178 --> 25:14.097
- Oh, Jesus. I'm sure he's fine.
- Great.

25:16.391 --> 25:17.934
Oh, God,
Jeff Chang, be careful.

25:21.271 --> 25:24.816
Hey, wait, wait, wait.
Was Nicole Latina?

25:24.983 --> 25:26.234
She could be half-tina.

25:26.401 --> 25:29.571
I don't know, man.
She seemed pretty Nordic to me.

25:29.738 --> 25:33.950
Dude, Cameron Diaz is Latina. It's just
a meaningless ethnic signifier. Come on.

25:35.577 --> 25:37.418
You know, sometimes,
you say the stupidest shit

25:37.454 --> 25:40.749
and other times it's like, Cameron Diaz,
Latina, I never even thought of that.

25:40.916 --> 25:43.335
Yeah, I really liked her in Shrek.

25:43.501 --> 25:45.337
Yeah, dude,
<i>Shrek</i> was fucking tight.

25:45.503 --> 25:48.840
I'm hungry!

25:49.007 --> 25:50.967
- I want waffles!
- Shit.

25:51.134 --> 25:53.470
- Go.
- I want waffles!

25:53.637 --> 25:56.556
He is way too loud.
We definitely can't bring him with us.

25:56.723 --> 25:58.003
Right, so, what are we gonna do?

25:58.058 --> 26:00.060
Well, we can't just
leave him here, man.

26:05.815 --> 26:08.335
Chill out with the rain dance.
I'm trying to tie you to the can.

26:09.778 --> 26:12.489
- Is this really the best idea?
- Probably not.

26:12.656 --> 26:15.659
- Let's hump and dump.
- That's not an expression, but OK.

26:25.377 --> 26:28.046
"Rosa. Maria"?

26:28.213 --> 26:31.299
"Incarnazion"?
Dude, something is wrong...

26:37.472 --> 26:39.182
Dude, what are you doing?

26:57.993 --> 26:58.994
Lupe?

27:00.287 --> 27:03.123
Honey, are you OK?

27:05.125 --> 27:07.794
Got a little cramp?
Need a tamp?

27:08.712 --> 27:09.963
Have you seen my bra?

27:10.130 --> 27:11.691
- Go, go, go.
- Maybe it's in your room.

27:11.798 --> 27:13.508
Fuck, it's a dead end.

27:13.675 --> 27:14.884
Go, go, go!

27:21.224 --> 27:25.687
Pledge Gomez and Pledge Aguilar are
eager for our spanking, Pledge Mistress!

27:27.063 --> 27:28.898
Lupita, are you OK?

27:34.070 --> 27:37.407
Lupe.

27:38.033 --> 27:38.950
Lupe.

27:39.117 --> 27:40.869
Is something wrong,
Pledge Mistress?

27:41.036 --> 27:42.662
Why are we not being spanked?

27:44.414 --> 27:47.375
- Don't, don't, don't.
- We wait eagerly, Pledge Mistress.

27:49.753 --> 27:52.172
Pledge Mistress, we are
deserving of this spanking.

27:52.339 --> 27:54.632
- Yes, they are.
- What are you doing?

27:54.799 --> 27:56.259
I'm gonna spank that ass.

27:56.426 --> 27:58.762
- No.
- I hear something.

27:58.928 --> 28:00.513
- Go check the door.
- We want to be spanked by you,

28:00.680 --> 28:02.265
Pledge Mistress.

28:08.897 --> 28:11.149
I feel nothing. Again.

28:11.316 --> 28:14.152
Pledge Aguilar requests
a spanking of her own, Pledge Mistress.

28:23.912 --> 28:25.455
What the fuck?

28:30.210 --> 28:32.045
- Fucking...
- I love sorority chicks.

28:34.547 --> 28:36.508
Pledge Mistress,
is there a man in the room?

28:39.260 --> 28:41.012
Well, say something.

28:41.179 --> 28:44.849
That's right, pledges.
This is a new part of your initiation.

28:45.016 --> 28:47.727
- Really, because that's not...
- Yeah, I don't know about that...

28:47.894 --> 28:49.771
Girls, this is
what the Pledge Mistress said.

28:49.938 --> 28:51.564
Guys, do you want me
to have to call Pledge Mistress?

28:51.731 --> 28:53.775
- No, no.
- I don't want to call Pledge Mistress.

28:53.942 --> 28:55.819
You know how she gets this time
of night, but I will wake her up

28:55.985 --> 28:57.529
and tell her you're
being disobedient pledges.

28:57.695 --> 28:59.823
- We're sorry.
- Yeah.

28:59.989 --> 29:03.201
- That's better.
- What's our new assignment?

29:03.368 --> 29:05.370
Find Nicole. Find Nicole.

29:05.537 --> 29:07.414
- Your new assignment...
- Find Nicole.

29:07.580 --> 29:09.582
- ...Is to start making out.
- What?

29:22.554 --> 29:23.805
Candy.

29:24.848 --> 29:26.683
I'm hungry-

29:35.567 --> 29:37.235
Who the fuck is this?

30:14.522 --> 30:15.899
Candy bar.

30:17.108 --> 30:18.526
This is so wrong.

30:21.321 --> 30:25.158
Relax, all the kids go les nowadays.
Isn't that right, Becca?

30:25.325 --> 30:28.912
Yeah, totally, but how is this
part of our sorority training again?

30:30.121 --> 30:32.832
I have no idea, but I love you.

30:33.708 --> 30:36.044
I want to make beautiful lesbian
babies with both of you.

30:36.211 --> 30:37.504
Look, do either of you guys...

30:37.670 --> 30:39.310
- God, they're really going at it.
- Yeah.

30:39.339 --> 30:41.591
Do either of you guys know
which room Nicole is in?

30:41.758 --> 30:44.135
Nicole? There's no Nicole
in this sorority.

30:44.302 --> 30:46.179
- What?
- She's not here.

30:46.346 --> 30:48.598
Dude... we're in the wrong sorority.

30:48.765 --> 30:51.309
No, dude, we're
in the right sorority.

30:56.814 --> 30:58.358
Eyes!

30:58.525 --> 30:59.776
Throat!

30:59.943 --> 31:01.986
Groin!

31:02.153 --> 31:04.322
All right, we do have
to get going soon.

31:04.489 --> 31:05.949
Yeah. No, we'll get going.

31:06.115 --> 31:08.576
Becca? Hey, sorry.

31:08.743 --> 31:11.343
- Will you grab her boobie a little bit?
- Come on, man, that's...

31:11.454 --> 31:15.833
Intruder in the house! Intruder!

31:16.000 --> 31:17.877
I'm so sorry.

31:18.044 --> 31:20.255
- Go, go!
- Go, go, go!

31:20.421 --> 31:22.131
Hey, get your ass back here!

31:25.468 --> 31:27.069
- Jeff Chang!
- Jeff Chang, we're coming!

31:28.888 --> 31:29.889
What the hell?

31:30.974 --> 31:32.058
Hey!

31:33.768 --> 31:35.228
We're gonna kick your ass!

31:35.395 --> 31:38.106
Ladies, please,
can we just talk about this?

31:38.273 --> 31:40.024
- Holy shit!
- Oh, window!

31:40.191 --> 31:42.819
Go, 90, 99, 99!

31:42.986 --> 31:46.114
- We're gonna fuck you up!
- Motherfuckers!

31:48.783 --> 31:50.118
How we gonna get him down?

31:53.246 --> 31:55.039
- We're gonna throw him off.
- What? No.

31:55.206 --> 31:57.500
Trust me. A pool cover's like a giant
pillow. I've done this a thousand times.

31:57.667 --> 32:00.753
- You have?
- We're gonna beat your ass!

32:00.920 --> 32:03.756
- OK, on three.
- Oh, my God, look.

32:03.923 --> 32:05.049
That's Nicole's sorority.

32:05.216 --> 32:06.718
- Oh, cool. OK.
- All right.

32:07.719 --> 32:10.054
One... two...

32:10.221 --> 32:12.098
- Fuck.
- ...three!

32:17.061 --> 32:18.062
Oh, my God.

32:21.065 --> 32:22.400
Did we just kill Jeff Chang?

32:25.528 --> 32:26.529
Jump!

32:31.784 --> 32:32.827
Oh, my God!
Dude, they're everywhere!

32:32.994 --> 32:34.996
Jeff Chang is
covered in rose thorns.

32:35.163 --> 32:36.803
- Open the fucking door!
- Can I help you?

32:36.956 --> 32:39.751
- Oh, my God, thank God you're white.
- Is Nicole here?

32:39.917 --> 32:41.711
- Yes, but... OK...
- Awesome.

32:41.878 --> 32:43.963
She doesn't want to see you.

32:44.672 --> 32:46.424
- OK, just be careful.
- Oh, my Lord.

32:46.591 --> 32:47.925
I'm looking at his asshole.

32:48.092 --> 32:50.219
So, whose idea was it
to throw Jeff off the roof?

32:50.386 --> 32:53.056
Casey. It was Casey's idea.

32:53.222 --> 32:55.808
I was all wrong about you.

32:55.975 --> 32:57.852
Had you pegged for
a real straight arrow.

32:58.019 --> 32:59.459
Oh, no, he is.
He went to space camp.

32:59.479 --> 33:01.230
- Thanks, man.
- Straight arrow.

33:01.397 --> 33:03.232
Yeah. I have a bit of a wild side.

33:03.399 --> 33:04.442
Oh, yeah?

33:04.609 --> 33:07.987
Sometimes after eating,
I jump right into the pool.

33:08.154 --> 33:10.698
- I don't even wait 20 minutes.
- You're a fucking renegade.

33:10.865 --> 33:11.991
- Yeah, you think so?
- Yeah.

33:12.158 --> 33:14.744
Sometimes at night...
I don't even wear my mouth guard.

33:14.911 --> 33:16.311
- Oh, my God.
- And I'm supposed to.

33:16.412 --> 33:17.997
That's recommended.

33:18.164 --> 33:19.666
- You're funny.
- Thanks.

33:19.832 --> 33:21.584
- I think you're funny too.
- Thank you.

33:21.751 --> 33:23.836
What the fuck are you guys doing?
OK, look, I go to the window

33:24.003 --> 33:25.421
to check out for our safety,
and I come back,

33:25.588 --> 33:28.466
it's all bananas in pajamas.
Let's get serious.

33:28.633 --> 33:31.719
- Do you know where Jeff Chang lives?
- I don't, I'm sorry.

33:31.886 --> 33:33.566
Do you know
any of his friends or anything?

33:33.638 --> 33:35.723
I met Jeff in my remedial
science study group,

33:35.890 --> 33:37.767
but he didn't really talk
to anyone else so...

33:37.934 --> 33:40.311
There we go, back at square one.
Not a single clue.

33:40.478 --> 33:43.272
Wait, your remedial
science group?

33:43.439 --> 33:45.600
Yeah, I'm a Bio major.
I tutor kids who are struggling.

33:45.692 --> 33:47.026
OK, no, Jeff Chang is Asian.

33:47.193 --> 33:49.320
- There's no remedial in that language.
- Yeah.

33:49.487 --> 33:52.240
Nicole, Jeff Chang
invented science, OK?

33:52.407 --> 33:54.409
Actually, he's failing
out of school.

33:56.536 --> 33:59.956
- This Jeff Chang, right here?
- Yeah. This Jeff Chang.

34:00.123 --> 34:01.207
You guys didn't know that?

34:01.374 --> 34:02.875
- No. No.
- What?

34:03.042 --> 34:06.212
What is going on with Jeff Chang?
First the gun and now this?

34:06.379 --> 34:07.899
Why wouldn't he tell us
he was failing?

34:07.964 --> 34:10.004
I don't know. Maybe he was
embarrassed or something.

34:10.049 --> 34:12.342
We're his best friends. You tell
your best friends stuff like that.

34:12.510 --> 34:13.886
Maybe we're not friends
like that anymore.

34:14.053 --> 34:16.889
What? OK, we're
in the middle of a crisis here.

34:17.056 --> 34:18.975
You're just gonna drop that
kind of shit on me right now?

34:19.141 --> 34:21.476
Listen, Nicole, is there
like a campus address book,

34:21.643 --> 34:24.188
or do you know anyone that
might know where he lives?

34:24.355 --> 34:26.399
No. Oh, wait,

34:26.565 --> 34:28.485
- Randy might know where Jeff lives.
- Oh, great.

34:28.568 --> 34:31.154
He's the campus pep leader.
He has every student's address

34:31.320 --> 34:33.121
in his phone for sending out
flyers and stuff.

34:33.281 --> 34:35.449
- So Randy is a cheerleader?
- Yell leader.

34:35.616 --> 34:37.255
- Oh, yell leader.
- Completely different.

34:37.326 --> 34:39.911
- Yeah, I didn't realize, OK.
- Straight to voice-mail.

34:40.079 --> 34:41.371
He's at the pep rally.

34:41.539 --> 34:43.081
You know what? I'm going to
a party on that side of campus,

34:43.248 --> 34:45.042
- I can take you guys over there.
- Great!

34:45.208 --> 34:46.668
OK, look, no, guys.
We can't just run out of here.

34:46.835 --> 34:48.295
We're surrounded by
Latins right now.

34:48.463 --> 34:49.964
They're coming in hot.
They're frickin' everywhere.

34:50.130 --> 34:52.507
- No worries. I have a car.
- She has a car!

34:52.675 --> 34:55.052
Nice. A little bit of a road trip?
We're on a mission.

34:55.219 --> 34:58.222
- OK, there she is.
- Go that way!

34:58.389 --> 35:00.433
Oh, fuck, what is that?
It looks like a toy.

35:00.600 --> 35:02.685
- Look over here!
- It's fine, it's a car.

35:02.852 --> 35:03.853
- We're coming.
- Dude, there's no way.

35:04.020 --> 35:05.354
There's Hispanics everywhere.

35:05.521 --> 35:07.064
- Check the bushes.
- OK, we gotta go, come on!

35:07.231 --> 35:09.692
No, no. This is stupid.
We're not gonna fit in that thing.

35:09.859 --> 35:12.195
- We'll be fine.
- I've taken shits bigger than that.

35:12.361 --> 35:14.363
I cannot believe you're jeopardizing
our mission for some girl.

35:14.530 --> 35:16.282
- Why? You think she likes me?
- No, you're a fucking nerd.

35:16.449 --> 35:18.075
That's what I was saying. It's like,

35:18.242 --> 35:19.911
I think she would date a guy
that rides a mountain bike...

35:20.077 --> 35:22.205
or like surfs in Costa Rica.

35:22.371 --> 35:24.373
Where do I fit in?

35:24.540 --> 35:26.751
- Fuck, this really isn't gonna work.
- I told you.

35:29.879 --> 35:32.715
There they are!

35:32.882 --> 35:34.884
Go, go, go!

35:40.807 --> 35:42.391
Get the fucking van.

35:58.407 --> 36:00.076
Is the pep rally
even still going on?

36:00.243 --> 36:02.161
Oh, yeah,
we've got State tomorrow.

36:02.328 --> 36:04.048
This campus is gonna
be going off all night.

36:04.163 --> 36:05.998
Oh, nice.

36:06.165 --> 36:07.917
Well, thanks for the ride.

36:08.084 --> 36:10.127
So, how are we gonna
find this Randy guy?

36:10.294 --> 36:12.839
Pep rally's right down that path.
Just look for the big truck.

36:13.005 --> 36:15.766
It's called the Spirit Mobile.
Randy should be around there somewhere.

36:15.883 --> 36:17.444
You sure you don't
want to come with us?

36:17.468 --> 36:20.388
I'd love to, but I'm already
super late to my party.

36:20.555 --> 36:22.598
And why is Randy gonna give us
Jeff Chang's address?

36:22.765 --> 36:23.975
Because he's my boyfriend.

36:24.767 --> 36:25.726
What?

36:25.893 --> 36:28.396
- Didn't I tell you that?
- No.

36:28.563 --> 36:30.481
- Yeah.
- Nicole, have a great night.

36:30.648 --> 36:33.568
- Thank you so much. You're a gem.
- OK, well, good luck.

36:33.734 --> 36:35.570
- OK.
- Great. Thank you.

36:35.736 --> 36:36.779
Bye.

36:39.282 --> 36:42.493
- Just don't.
- Casey, I'm not gonna say anything.

36:43.452 --> 36:45.037
Can't believe she has
a boyfriend, though, right?

36:45.204 --> 36:46.581
I thought she would have
said something earlier.

36:46.747 --> 36:50.376
It makes sense. That's why she wasn't,
you know, feeling me.

36:50.543 --> 36:52.128
But I'm not gonna say anything.
I won't say anything.

36:52.295 --> 36:55.295
I don't want to rub salt in your wound
'cause I could tell you're hurting...

36:55.631 --> 36:57.258
But I didn't know
she had a boyfriend.

36:57.425 --> 36:59.051
Let's just find this guy, OK?

36:59.218 --> 37:01.053
I bet he's huge, by the way.

37:01.220 --> 37:04.640
Probably super flexible.
The guy could probably blow himself.

37:04.807 --> 37:07.935
I'd blow myself,
but I have a long torso.

37:08.102 --> 37:09.862
But seriously,
does your sister ask about me?

37:11.939 --> 37:12.940
Check the alley!

37:13.107 --> 37:15.109
Let's find these motherfuckers!

37:19.280 --> 37:20.990
What the hell's going on out here?

37:22.658 --> 37:25.578
Hey... have you seen these guys?

37:25.745 --> 37:26.996
I've been looking
for them all night.

37:27.163 --> 37:29.665
They were also carrying
a drunk Asian kid.

37:29.832 --> 37:32.877
I got you, you little turds.

37:51.646 --> 37:53.856
Hey, let's check over there
by the big truck.

37:55.858 --> 37:58.486
Look, cheerleaders!
Let's ask the cheerleaders.

37:58.653 --> 38:00.780
Excuse me! Excuse me!

38:00.947 --> 38:03.387
- Do you know where Randy is?
- He's behind the Spirit Mobile.

38:03.491 --> 38:04.617
Oh, thank you.

38:14.377 --> 38:16.796
Excuse me, hey, are you Randy?

38:18.089 --> 38:20.633
- Oh, no.
- What the fuck you doing here?

38:20.800 --> 38:22.551
Who's this guy, Randy?

38:22.718 --> 38:24.720
These are the motherfuckers
that threw a dart at my face.

38:24.887 --> 38:27.139
- Break them down, Randy.
- Wait, this is the guy from the bar?

38:27.306 --> 38:28.140
Yeah.

38:28.307 --> 38:30.977
You got a lot of nerve
coming into my house.

38:31.143 --> 38:33.562
You are not cool enough
to call something your house.

38:33.729 --> 38:36.732
Plus, we're outside, so it doesn't
even make sense. There's no house.

38:36.899 --> 38:38.859
- It's a metaphor, bitch.
- Dude, dude.

38:39.026 --> 38:42.154
I'm sorry about my friend.
Look, we just talked to Nicole and...

38:42.321 --> 38:43.906
You talked to my girl?

38:44.073 --> 38:45.574
Yeah, I wouldn't
have gone that route.

38:45.741 --> 38:47.576
Yeah, listen, we're just trying
to get our friend home

38:47.743 --> 38:49.662
and she said you might have
his address in your phone?

38:49.829 --> 38:51.914
Nicole said that?

38:52.081 --> 38:53.916
- Lock him up, Randy.
- Sweep the leg, Randy.

38:54.083 --> 38:55.710
"Sweep the leg"?

38:55.876 --> 38:58.421
- Hurt his feelings, Randy.
- Crush his spirit, Randy.

38:58.587 --> 39:01.549
Well, I mean, I should
probably help them out, right?

39:03.384 --> 39:04.677
Here's my phone, motherfuckers.

39:05.803 --> 39:08.044
- Come and get it.
- Can we just be grown-ups about this?

39:08.097 --> 39:10.599
- OK, I'm done talking. What's up?
- Dude, what are you doing?

39:10.766 --> 39:12.446
- Oh, shit, Randy!
- He's got a gun, Randy!

39:12.518 --> 39:14.478
- I'm scared, Randy.
- Give me your fucking phone, Randy!

39:14.645 --> 39:17.606
- Put the fucking gun away, OK?
- No, dude, you know what? I know guns.

39:17.773 --> 39:19.775
- That shit ain't even real.
- Is this real?

39:23.821 --> 39:26.449
Yeah, baby, kick his ass, Randy!

39:26.615 --> 39:30.077
- Yeah, boy! Fuck him up!
- Yeah, beat his ass, Randy!

39:30.244 --> 39:31.871
Break a leg, baby!

39:37.960 --> 39:40.588
Oh, shit, Randy.

39:40.755 --> 39:41.922
I got it, I got the phone.

39:43.007 --> 39:45.885
- Pussies!
- Where the hell are you going?

39:46.052 --> 39:49.221
- Hey!
- Get up, Randy. Let's get him, Randy!

39:51.640 --> 39:54.643
Move, move, get out the way!
Watch it!

39:55.895 --> 39:56.937
Fuck!

40:03.778 --> 40:04.987
Fuck!

40:15.998 --> 40:18.125
There he is! I see him!

40:23.005 --> 40:24.173
Yeah, we got you now!

40:24.340 --> 40:25.382
You're cornered, dude!

40:25.549 --> 40:28.010
- We're gonna fuck up your face!
- Miller!

40:29.178 --> 40:30.387
Get in, get in, get in!

40:30.554 --> 40:32.181
Hey! I'm in, I'm in!
Go, go, go!

40:36.685 --> 40:39.605
Find 'em? All right, go.
Look for them. Come on, I want...

40:45.528 --> 40:48.447
That was so dumb. That was so dumb.

40:48.614 --> 40:51.454
This Randy guy's a massive douche,
but I actually really like his phone.

40:51.617 --> 40:53.702
Just tell me that Jeff Chang's
address is in there.

40:53.869 --> 40:56.372
OK, Jeffrey Reginald Chang.

40:56.539 --> 40:59.875
- Four-nineteen Oak Street, number two.
- Oh, thank God.

41:00.042 --> 41:04.547
And that is located... six blocks away.
And boom goes the dynamite.

41:04.713 --> 41:07.049
- Nice. Finally!
- Nice.

41:07.216 --> 41:09.093
Finally.
We're gonna get you home, buddy.

41:10.719 --> 41:13.013
- I'm glad we didn't ruin his life.
- He's still breathing, right?

41:13.180 --> 41:14.515
Who cares? Go straight here.

41:14.682 --> 41:16.976
OK, so this is good.
We're gonna have him home by four.

41:17.143 --> 41:20.396
He'll be able to nap it out for
a few hours and be good to go by seven.

41:20.563 --> 41:22.231
His asshole father
will never know.

41:28.154 --> 41:32.992
Hello? Honey, I told you.

41:33.159 --> 41:36.620
I knocked on his door,
he didn't answer.

41:36.787 --> 41:38.467
I called his cell phone.
He didn't pick up.

41:39.748 --> 41:41.750
<i>- Oh, man, he's gonna pay for this.
- Why didn't you wake him up?</i>

41:41.917 --> 41:46.297
No, he's not asleep.
He's out here. I can feel it in my knee.

41:48.507 --> 41:50.593
So, what about that buffalo,
you think it's OK?

41:50.759 --> 41:52.344
- No, they're gonna kill it.
- Really?

41:52.511 --> 41:55.264
Buffalos only live for like
three years anyway, man.

41:55.431 --> 41:57.183
- Was that The Chief again?
- Yes, it is.

41:57.349 --> 41:59.393
Stay awesome, Chief!

41:59.560 --> 42:00.603
Hey!

42:19.371 --> 42:21.248
Oh, my God. Oh, God!

42:21.415 --> 42:23.417
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

42:23.584 --> 42:25.252
- Awesome.
- You were right, man.

42:25.419 --> 42:26.253
Golf carts go down stairs.

42:26.420 --> 42:29.423
Holy shit, I fucking love college, man.
I don't know why I ever left.

42:30.299 --> 42:31.467
Wait, what?

42:31.967 --> 42:33.052
What?

42:34.094 --> 42:36.180
Did you drop out of college?

42:36.347 --> 42:39.642
It's me, man. You can tell me whatever
you want. I'm not gonna make a big deal.

42:39.808 --> 42:41.644
- OK, yeah, I dropped out of college.
- What?

42:41.810 --> 42:43.103
- Two years ago.
- Two...

42:43.270 --> 42:45.111
What have you been doing
for fucking two years?

42:45.272 --> 42:47.650
I work at a gas station, man.

42:47.816 --> 42:50.361
I get, you know, free snacks.
I get free smokes.

42:50.527 --> 42:52.571
Like, I hang out
with my boy Varaj... Varag.

42:52.738 --> 42:54.156
You have a boy "Varaj"?

42:54.323 --> 42:56.659
- Yeah, he's pretty...
- This is... Oh, my God.

42:56.825 --> 42:59.203
Dude, look, Casey, I don't know why
you're acting so surprised, man.

42:59.370 --> 43:01.288
Like, I'm not Jeff Chang,
I'm not you.

43:01.455 --> 43:03.415
I wasn't gonna do
awesome stuff with my life.

43:03.582 --> 43:07.086
- Like... this is what's up.
- OK. What a cop-out.

43:07.253 --> 43:10.172
You're one of the smartest
people I've ever met.

43:10.339 --> 43:12.007
Really?

43:12.174 --> 43:14.343
- Top 25. Whatever, man.
- Fuck you.

43:14.510 --> 43:17.221
- You aced your SAT's, right?
- Yeah.

43:17.388 --> 43:19.890
And remember Mary what's-her-name?
The hot born-again chick?

43:20.057 --> 43:21.100
No one could get near her,

43:21.267 --> 43:23.644
and then you stole third base
with her at the book fair.

43:23.811 --> 43:24.971
- She liked to read.
- I know.

43:24.979 --> 43:28.232
I don't know what you said to her,
but it must have been pretty smart.

43:28.399 --> 43:30.359
I told her I had leukemia.

43:31.527 --> 43:33.696
That's actually pretty dark.

43:33.862 --> 43:36.115
Whatever, man. The point is
you're really smart.

43:36.282 --> 43:38.909
- You're just lazy as fuck.
- Yeah.

43:39.076 --> 43:41.495
- I'm not bullshitting, man.
- I know, you're right.

43:41.662 --> 43:43.622
I just gotta get my shit
together, man.

43:43.789 --> 43:45.708
I just gotta get my shit together.

43:50.921 --> 43:52.047
I miss you, dude.

43:52.214 --> 43:55.592
We don't really get to talk
like this much anymore.

43:58.220 --> 44:00.472
Look, maybe I could take
a couple weeks off this summer

44:00.639 --> 44:02.766
and catch up with you guys
at the Sidewinder Festival.

44:02.933 --> 44:04.018
- Yeah?
- Yeah, man.

44:04.184 --> 44:06.270
- That's awesome, Casey!
- I miss you guys too.

44:06.437 --> 44:09.982
Dude, I'm gonna fuck so much unwashed
hippie ass it's gonna be embarrassing.

44:10.149 --> 44:11.942
- Right.
- I like the hippie chicks, man.

44:12.109 --> 44:13.235
They don't shave their legs.

44:13.402 --> 44:15.154
That means they have
a huge bush and you know me...

44:15.321 --> 44:17.823
- Yeah, you love bushes. Yeah.
- I like a good bush. Fuck.

44:17.990 --> 44:20.576
OK, Jeff Chang's apartment
is right up here on the left.

44:20.743 --> 44:23.287
Nice. We got you home, buddy.

44:23.454 --> 44:26.290
- This doesn't look right.
- What the shit is this?

44:34.923 --> 44:37.676
- You sure this is the right address?
- Yeah.

44:37.843 --> 44:39.928
Must be an old address.

44:40.929 --> 44:43.265
- Fuck.
- Fuck.

44:45.267 --> 44:46.907
All right, well, come on,
let's go inside.

44:46.935 --> 44:49.188
Maybe someone in his old room
knows where he lives now.

45:11.293 --> 45:12.294
Jesus.

45:14.004 --> 45:15.381
Look at this place, man.

45:15.547 --> 45:18.008
Yeah, these nerds
know how to party, bro!

45:18.175 --> 45:20.469
Oh, dude, Beer Pong?
We gotta play. We gotta play.

45:20.636 --> 45:22.956
Yeah, man. That would be great,
but we got some shit to do.

45:23.055 --> 45:24.556
Hey, your elbow's
over the table!

45:24.723 --> 45:26.475
- Shut up, you piece of shit!
- Hey, fuck you, man!

45:26.642 --> 45:28.522
- Watch your elbow, asshole!
- Thirty seconds...

45:28.644 --> 45:31.980
- I'm gonna kick that guy's ass!
- Dude, what is wrong with you?

45:38.028 --> 45:41.281
- Oh, my God. You are so cute.
- Hello. Oh, my God.

45:41.448 --> 45:44.201
Bang on my door one more fucking time
and I'll claw your fucking eyes out.

45:44.368 --> 45:45.661
What?

45:45.828 --> 45:47.704
OK... Do you know this guy?

45:47.871 --> 45:49.164
Why, because I'm Asian?

45:49.331 --> 45:51.458
We don't all know each other,
you racist mother...

45:51.625 --> 45:54.545
Wait, I do know this guy.
Yeah, he used to live here.

45:54.711 --> 45:56.755
Do you know where he lives now?

45:56.922 --> 45:59.258
No, I used to live across the hall
and he never talked to anyone.

45:59.425 --> 46:00.384
Of course he didn't.

46:00.551 --> 46:03.053
That's why I was shocked when the cops
came and arrested his bitch ass.

46:03.220 --> 46:04.388
Wait, what?

46:04.555 --> 46:06.348
What would the cops
possibly want with Jeff Chang?

46:06.515 --> 46:10.811
I don't fucking know, but he moved out
after that and I never saw him again.

46:10.978 --> 46:13.355
What is going on with Jeff Chang?

46:13.522 --> 46:15.190
Motherfucker took
my laundry detergent.

46:15.357 --> 46:18.694
He's packing heat, he's failing out
of school, and now he's a criminal?

46:18.861 --> 46:21.901
Maybe he's a Yakuza or something. This
chick is really fucking turning me on.

46:21.905 --> 46:24.408
Do you have a forwarding address
for Jeff Chang?

46:24.575 --> 46:27.995
Yeah, yeah, no, I do.
No, you fucking cock lickers.

46:28.162 --> 46:29.842
You could check with our RA.
He might know.

46:29.955 --> 46:33.417
- Your RA, where is your RA? Miller!
- What, the fuck...

46:33.584 --> 46:36.545
Top floor. His name is PJ Brill
and he's throwing this fucking party

46:36.712 --> 46:37.752
if you could believe that.

46:37.838 --> 46:39.798
- She has such a mouth on her.
- I believe it. I believe it.

46:39.965 --> 46:41.605
Yeah, and when you see
the beaver muncher,

46:41.633 --> 46:44.219
tell him to get all the titties
and butt-fuckers out of my foyer.

46:44.386 --> 46:46.555
I got fucking field hockey tomorrow.

46:50.225 --> 46:52.186
Here we go.

46:52.352 --> 46:54.646
- Where do you think you're going?
- We're going up.

46:54.813 --> 46:56.982
- No way. Tower of Power, dude.
- What?

46:57.149 --> 46:58.692
- What's the Tower of Power?
- Yeah.

46:58.859 --> 47:01.904
You gotta win the event on each
floor to move up a level. Hey.

47:02.070 --> 47:04.156
- You have to be kidding me.
- Nope.

47:04.323 --> 47:06.450
- OK, how many levels are there?
- There's eight.

47:06.617 --> 47:09.453
OK, we just need to talk
to this guy named PJ Brill?

47:09.620 --> 47:11.455
PJ Brill is Tower Master.

47:11.622 --> 47:14.500
You wanna talk to him,
you gotta get to the top level.

47:14.666 --> 47:16.502
How do big dumb animals
like you even get into college?

47:16.668 --> 47:19.963
Just 'cause I look like this...
doesn't mean I don't have feelings.

47:21.131 --> 47:23.258
Look, we just need
to get our friend home, OK?

47:23.425 --> 47:25.636
- Can you help us out? Please?
- Come on, man.

47:25.802 --> 47:26.970
Tower of Power, dude.

47:28.096 --> 47:29.848
- Tower of Power, dude?
- Tower of Power.

47:30.015 --> 47:31.455
What are we gonna
do with Jeff Chang?

47:33.519 --> 47:35.187
Oh, stoners.

47:37.147 --> 47:39.149
- Hey, what's up, dudes?
- What's going on?

47:39.316 --> 47:41.036
You guys mind watching
our friend for a bit?

47:41.193 --> 47:44.154
Sure, man. Killer.

47:44.321 --> 47:47.783
These guys look super high.
You sure this is a good idea?

47:47.950 --> 47:50.077
Relax, dude, these morons
aren't going anywhere.

47:50.244 --> 47:52.644
Now, come on! Let's show these
clown dicks how to pong, baby.

47:52.663 --> 47:54.289
- Fuck, yeah!
- Fuck, yeah!

48:16.270 --> 48:19.147
Ethnic Serbs.
These guys can pong.

48:19.314 --> 48:22.025
Fuck the Balkan states.
OK, bros, when we beat you,

48:22.192 --> 48:26.154
you can't rape us and steal our land,
OK? No rapey. No rapey.

48:27.656 --> 48:28.782
OK. Nice shot.

48:29.491 --> 48:30.367
Mazel tov.

48:34.371 --> 48:36.039
Fucking Serbs.

48:37.207 --> 48:38.292
Here we go.

48:39.209 --> 48:40.460
And we're back!

48:40.627 --> 48:41.795
Twinkle, twinkle, baby.
Twinkle, twinkle.

48:41.962 --> 48:42.963
- Good.
- Drink up, Serb.

48:43.130 --> 48:44.756
Know what that tastes like?
Freedom.

48:45.507 --> 48:46.758
Yeah!

48:46.925 --> 48:49.803
Hey, Ivan Drago, this one's
for you and your sweet jumpsuit.

48:49.970 --> 48:51.972
Sucka.

48:52.139 --> 48:53.819
Say something, bro.
You're freaking me out.

48:53.932 --> 48:56.351
This one's for Apollo Creed.
His spirit lives on.

48:57.686 --> 48:58.937
- Yeah!
- That's what I'm talking about!

48:59.104 --> 49:01.464
- That's what I'm talking about!
- Paper covers rock, bitch.

49:01.481 --> 49:04.901
- Rock covers your Russian ass!
- That's right... different cultures.

49:06.361 --> 49:07.529
Sky hook.

49:09.364 --> 49:10.407
That's unbelievable!

49:10.574 --> 49:13.493
- Last shot, last shot.
- Kiss it. Kiss it.

49:19.625 --> 49:20.584
Yeah!

49:20.751 --> 49:22.419
That's unbelievable!

49:22.586 --> 49:24.129
USA! USA!

49:24.296 --> 49:25.936
- Red, white and blue!
- Undefeated, baby!

49:26.048 --> 49:28.383
- Give me my beads, bitch!
- Sorry, he doesn't mean that.

49:28.550 --> 49:30.302
Tower of fucking Power!

49:30.469 --> 49:33.263
All day!

49:36.058 --> 49:39.227
That's right, baby!
You did it. You know you did it.

49:45.567 --> 49:47.319
Yes!

49:52.115 --> 49:54.451
- What's the name of the game?
- Thumper!

49:54.618 --> 49:57.829
- And why do we play?
- To get fucked up!

50:03.460 --> 50:04.294
Yeah!

50:10.300 --> 50:12.678
- Yeah!
- Give me my beads.

50:19.184 --> 50:20.864
That's what I'm talking about,
right there!

50:21.937 --> 50:23.271
Dude, what?

50:29.444 --> 50:32.656
Chug, chug, chug, chug!

50:38.620 --> 50:40.872
Almost there!
Holy shit! You can do this!

50:43.792 --> 50:44.960
No.

50:54.219 --> 50:56.471
- Suck and Blow!
- Fucking child's play.

50:56.638 --> 50:58.348
All right, last event,
get in line.

50:58.515 --> 51:01.309
I'm gonna go get in there.
Let's go, Suck and Blow party.

51:02.477 --> 51:03.645
Casey?

51:05.021 --> 51:06.064
Nicole?

51:06.231 --> 51:08.984
- So this was your party.
- Hey.

51:09.151 --> 51:11.194
- Did you get Jeff home OK?
- No, actually,

51:11.361 --> 51:13.405
we left him downstairs
with a couple random stoners.

51:13.572 --> 51:16.450
Wait, are you serious?

51:16.616 --> 51:18.827
Yeah, actually, now that I think
about it, it's kind of a horrible idea.

51:18.994 --> 51:20.154
I don't know why we did that.

51:26.001 --> 51:28.378
- Hey, Walsh.
- Yeah, bro?

51:28.545 --> 51:30.672
Hey, man, who's this dude?

51:35.761 --> 51:37.846
So, Randy didn't
have Jeff's address?

51:38.013 --> 51:40.932
Yeah, no, your boyfriend actually
turned out to be a bit of a dead end.

51:41.099 --> 51:42.309
Balls, I'm sorry.

51:42.476 --> 51:44.561
Can I ask you what
you see in that guy?

51:44.728 --> 51:46.396
- Is this you being jealous?
- No!

51:46.563 --> 51:47.856
- Is that what that is?
- I'm not jealous.

51:48.023 --> 51:49.691
- Yes, you are.
- Why am I jealous?

51:49.858 --> 51:54.279
Why, 'cause he's handsome
and has phenomenal school spirit?

51:54.446 --> 51:57.365
Randy is pretty crazy,
but he's also fun.

51:57.532 --> 51:59.534
And he's passionate
and I like that in a guy.

51:59.701 --> 52:02.913
Yeah, but he's passionate about
cheerleading and fighting people.

52:03.079 --> 52:05.248
It's like the two worst things
to be passionate about.

52:05.415 --> 52:08.460
OK, all right, what are you
passionate about, Casey?

52:12.130 --> 52:15.050
- I'm passionate about a lot of things.
- What NPR?

52:15.217 --> 52:19.387
Yeah, yeah, I actually like NPR a bit.
They have a nice little Morning Edition,

52:19.554 --> 52:21.274
sometimes I get some
cooking tips from them.

52:23.517 --> 52:24.726
- Cute ringtone.
- Sorry.

52:24.893 --> 52:26.394
I thought that
might have been him.

52:26.561 --> 52:30.357
He hasn't returned my texts all night.
I... hate it when he does this.

52:31.483 --> 52:33.735
Well, enough about Randy.

52:33.902 --> 52:35.463
Would you like
to Suck and Blow with me?

52:35.612 --> 52:37.739
I thought you'd never ask.

52:42.536 --> 52:45.038
Dude, does it look
like the bear's...

52:45.205 --> 52:49.584
- ...blowing him enough yet or what?
- It looks great, I believe it.

52:49.751 --> 52:54.756
What about the face...
Should I write, "Douchebag"?

52:54.923 --> 52:58.593
Or "Fucktard"?

53:05.183 --> 53:08.436
Very nice form.
Where did you learn to play?

53:08.603 --> 53:10.272
Hanover Lake every summer.

53:10.438 --> 53:12.358
No way, I used to spend
every winter break there.

53:12.524 --> 53:13.859
- No!
- I swear to God.

53:15.986 --> 53:18.426
The card needs to be a little
higher, Danielle. For next time.

53:18.488 --> 53:21.283
Yeah, people say that
it's like old and run down,

53:21.449 --> 53:23.410
but I think it's the most
beautiful place in the world.

53:23.577 --> 53:26.121
Yes! Well, except for that
creepy guy that sells pinecones.

53:26.288 --> 53:28.748
- Creepy Dan the Pinecone Man!
- Yes! Oh, my God!

53:30.750 --> 53:32.168
I can tell you don't like me,
but if you have a sister

53:32.335 --> 53:33.837
who looks like you...

53:35.088 --> 53:36.840
I can't believe that
you know Hanover Lake.

53:37.007 --> 53:38.800
It is literally
my favorite place on earth.

53:38.967 --> 53:41.511
It's like, all you need
to know about me.

53:41.678 --> 53:44.598
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah, I know exactly what you mean.

53:46.975 --> 53:49.415
Jesus Christ, we're playing
Suck and Blow, people. Game faces.

53:53.189 --> 53:55.817
Oh, God.
Randy's in the hospital.

53:55.984 --> 53:58.236
He got mauled
by a fucking buffalo.

53:58.403 --> 54:01.406
Some asshole stole his phone.
That's why he hasn't texted.

54:01.573 --> 54:05.160
- Oh, my God, I'm such a bitch.
- Do you want me to come with you?

54:05.327 --> 54:07.412
Probably not, right?

54:08.496 --> 54:09.623
All right, bye.

54:12.959 --> 54:14.169
Let her go, man.

54:14.336 --> 54:16.504
Sometimes the heart
is a lonely hunter.

54:18.173 --> 54:21.468
Do you want to cry?
I'll fucking cry for you.

54:23.011 --> 54:24.763
Do you want to make out with me?

54:24.930 --> 54:26.473
No? Kenny, you can come too.

54:27.599 --> 54:29.100
You look like a watcher.

54:36.524 --> 54:37.901
He's waking up, dude.

54:38.068 --> 54:40.153
I can't just leave it.
It says "DOUCHEBA"...

54:40.320 --> 54:42.447
- No one's gonna get it.
- The public will understand.

54:42.614 --> 54:44.741
- This is my art.
- Stop being such a diva.

54:46.701 --> 54:49.037
Fuck, dude... we gotta go!

54:52.791 --> 54:54.334
What the fuck?

54:58.838 --> 55:01.132
Top floor, baby, top floor!

55:03.718 --> 55:06.179
- What the hell is this?
- Holy shit.

55:06.346 --> 55:08.473
- What is this place?
- OK, shit just got weird.

55:08.640 --> 55:11.226
Congratulations, players.

55:11.393 --> 55:13.436
You've completed
the Tower of Power.

55:13.603 --> 55:17.232
- You PJ Brill?
- Please, call me Tower Master.

55:17.399 --> 55:18.900
These are my sweet bitches.

55:19.067 --> 55:21.569
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- What's up, sweet bitches?

55:21.736 --> 55:25.991
- Look, we're friends with Jeff Chang...
- Now, here is your reward.

55:27.367 --> 55:29.869
Gold beads?
You gotta be kidding me, dude.

55:30.036 --> 55:31.705
All right, are you fucking serious, man?

55:31.871 --> 55:33.311
I want more than gold fucking beads.

55:33.331 --> 55:35.375
Miller, it's not
about the beads, man.

55:35.542 --> 55:37.335
They gave me 50 bucks
for this whole party, all right?

55:37.502 --> 55:39.879
Fifty bucks!
The chair, it was 40! All right?

55:40.046 --> 55:41.881
These chicks, I'm paying them
five bucks each tonight.

55:42.048 --> 55:43.568
So maybe you guys
could cut me a break.

55:43.591 --> 55:45.593
Maybe he can cut us a break
'cause I just chugged a gallon of milk.

55:45.760 --> 55:48.054
Went through your little rat race.
I'm all excited, get to the top floor

55:48.221 --> 55:49.582
and look what I got, look at this.

55:49.639 --> 55:51.683
I have a baby wizard Elvis
with gold beads.

55:51.850 --> 55:54.185
I'm sorry you got free booze
and free milk. Shit!

55:54.352 --> 55:56.855
My fault, buddy! OK, do you know
how much milk costs?

55:57.022 --> 55:59.274
- Like, it's more than gasoline.
- We're friends with Jeff Chang...

55:59.441 --> 56:02.777
Hey, can I get my banana? These dudes
are like stressing me. Thanks.

56:04.446 --> 56:07.449
- OK, who are we talking about?
- Jeff Chang. He used to live here.

56:07.615 --> 56:08.950
You were his RA.
The cops came in here...

56:09.117 --> 56:10.493
Oh, yeah, yeah!

56:10.660 --> 56:13.371
He got super wasted and we're
just trying to get him home.

56:13.538 --> 56:15.618
No, I don't know where
that little psycho lives, man.

56:15.707 --> 56:17.587
Why you calling him a psycho?
What's that about?

56:17.625 --> 56:19.786
Dude, the guy got arrested
for attempted murder, right?

56:19.794 --> 56:21.337
- What?
- Yeah, that's fucking psycho, right?

56:21.504 --> 56:24.132
- Murder? Are you kidding me?
- Bullshit. Who did he try to kill?

56:24.299 --> 56:26.659
I don't know, but he had a gun
and he fucking used it, dude.

56:26.801 --> 56:28.803
- That doesn't make any sense.
- Yeah. Right?

56:28.970 --> 56:30.972
You know, the boy's a little nuts.

56:32.724 --> 56:34.100
Coming from a man in a diaper,
eating a banana.

56:34.267 --> 56:35.977
OK, I get it.

56:36.144 --> 56:38.980
I might not look
like your average dude. OK?

56:39.147 --> 56:40.356
- That's for sure.
- But I've got bitches

56:40.523 --> 56:43.485
and I've got goblets and
I wake up in the morning happy.

56:43.651 --> 56:45.012
- Miller...
- Your nipples are just

56:45.153 --> 56:47.238
- looking right at me.
- What the fuck, man?

56:47.405 --> 56:49.074
- Thanks for nothing.
- OK.

56:49.240 --> 56:50.700
- PJ Brill, you fucking weirdo.
- Let's get out of here.

56:50.867 --> 56:52.327
Have some beer, have some milk.

56:52.494 --> 56:55.705
I'll try to get iPods for you guys
next time. That'd be great, right?

56:55.872 --> 56:58.166
This is bullshit.

56:58.333 --> 57:00.960
You don't think Jeff Chang
actually tried to kill someone, do you?

57:01.127 --> 57:04.798
No, I don't. I think Jeff Chang is fine.
I think everything is fine.

57:04.964 --> 57:08.843
- Look at that asshole.
- Yeah, what an idiot.

57:09.010 --> 57:11.513
- Wait. Is that Jeff Chang?
- What is he wearing?

57:11.679 --> 57:12.959
Oh, my God, he's drinking again.

57:13.098 --> 57:14.557
- Fuck me!
- Move.

57:14.724 --> 57:17.393
- Jeff Chang! We're coming!
- Put the bottle down, buddy!

57:21.523 --> 57:24.526
Yeah!

57:24.692 --> 57:27.612
Mommy, look at me dance!
Look at me dance!

57:28.613 --> 57:30.198
Look at me dance!

57:31.241 --> 57:34.244
- Holy shit!
- Oh, my God.

57:35.286 --> 57:36.579
Suck my dick, bear!

57:36.746 --> 57:39.415
Suck my motherfucking dick, bear!

57:40.041 --> 57:42.669
Yeah!

57:42.836 --> 57:45.255
Hey, chipmunk, hey,
I'm one of the good guys.

57:45.421 --> 57:47.215
We're gonna get you
some clothes, OK?

57:47.382 --> 57:48.550
It's all gonna be OK.

57:49.801 --> 57:51.177
You'll never catch me alive.

57:53.847 --> 57:54.848
Fuck!

57:57.225 --> 57:59.018
Fuck!

58:00.562 --> 58:02.689
I'm gonna kick his ass!

58:02.856 --> 58:05.859
We're not gonna kick your ass!
We do need you to come back, though!

58:36.181 --> 58:38.474
Oh, shit! Lookit...

58:38.641 --> 58:41.895
- It's the big bad po-po!
- Get down, sir.

58:42.061 --> 58:44.522
Get down immediately.

58:46.774 --> 58:49.110
- What are you doing, sir?
- I think he's getting down.

58:49.277 --> 58:51.154
- Yeah, I know, I see that.
- I'm just saying, technically,

58:51.321 --> 58:53.656
he's doing what you asked him to do.

58:55.200 --> 58:56.534
What the fuck?

58:56.701 --> 58:58.244
OK, sir,
please remove yourself...

58:58.411 --> 59:00.371
He's our friend!

59:00.538 --> 59:01.706
What the hell is this?

59:02.832 --> 59:04.500
- Dr. Chang! Hi. What are you...
- Hey.

59:04.667 --> 59:07.003
- It's so good to see you, man!
- Great to see you.

59:07.170 --> 59:09.964
Where's my son?

59:11.424 --> 59:13.927
He's home. He's in bed.
He's sleeping.

59:14.552 --> 59:17.513
- Why don't I believe you?
- Because you're suspicious and mean?

59:18.431 --> 59:20.642
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, touch my fucking ass, dude!

59:20.808 --> 59:23.144
Come on! OK. OK.

59:23.311 --> 59:26.606
Hey! Why are you asking
about Jeffrey? Is everything OK?

59:26.773 --> 59:29.776
I have reason to believe that
the three of you have been out drinking.

59:29.943 --> 59:34.864
What? No. We put Jeff to bed
at like nine o'clock, right, Miller?

59:35.031 --> 59:37.992
Yeah, we watched Cold Case,
made paninis and then went to bed.

59:38.159 --> 59:41.329
Yeah, then Miller and I came out
for a drink, or nine.

59:41.496 --> 59:44.165
What?

59:46.042 --> 59:48.044
Your parents must be
so proud of you.

59:48.211 --> 59:49.879
- Get him!
- Free OJ!

59:50.046 --> 59:51.756
Free the dolphins!

59:52.757 --> 59:54.133
Fuck you, cop!

59:54.300 --> 59:55.760
- Oh, my God.
- Fuck.

59:55.927 --> 59:58.471
You kids today.

59:58.638 --> 01:00:01.891
Every one of you is spoiled,
drunk and fat!

01:00:02.058 --> 01:00:04.602
- Oh, my God, right?
- Thank you, sir.

01:00:04.769 --> 01:00:05.770
- Appreciate it.
- Look.

01:00:07.730 --> 01:00:10.358
- Miller, look.
- Fuck that!

01:00:33.089 --> 01:00:36.009
Here are tonight's winners.

01:00:42.515 --> 01:00:43.766
Jesus.

01:00:43.933 --> 01:00:46.728
I feel like someone
should break those two up, right?

01:00:46.894 --> 01:00:48.730
Do you see your friend or what?

01:00:48.896 --> 01:00:51.733
No, is there anywhere else
you might have taken him?

01:00:51.899 --> 01:00:54.610
- Jeffrey Reginald Chang?
- Yeah.

01:00:54.777 --> 01:00:56.612
What? What is it?

01:00:56.779 --> 01:00:58.531
They've taken him
to Health Services.

01:00:59.824 --> 01:01:02.493
- What does that mean?
- I wouldn't want to speculate.

01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:04.746
Look, I'm sure he's OK.

01:01:04.912 --> 01:01:07.123
No, he's not OK, Miller.
He could be in a coma.

01:01:07.290 --> 01:01:08.875
- You understand that?
- No, yeah. Absolutely.

01:01:09.042 --> 01:01:10.418
All right, how do we get
to Health Services?

01:01:10.585 --> 01:01:12.420
- You're gonna wanna go...
- I can take you.

01:01:12.587 --> 01:01:13.963
Who are you? Why is
she wearing an orange vest?

01:01:14.130 --> 01:01:16.382
I'm Cara.
I'm a campus security escort.

01:01:16.549 --> 01:01:18.259
- Why don't you come with me?
- Of course you are.

01:01:18.426 --> 01:01:20.136
- I will come with you. Casey.
- What?

01:01:20.303 --> 01:01:22.889
- She's an escort. Whatever.
- She not that kind of escort.

01:01:23.056 --> 01:01:25.767
No, I love the name Cara.
In fact, my mother's name is Cara.

01:01:25.933 --> 01:01:27.853
Your mother's name is Beth.
Everybody knows that.

01:01:28.019 --> 01:01:29.812
Yeah, but I call her Cara,
sometimes.

01:01:29.979 --> 01:01:33.024
But, Cara, where are
your people from? Italy?

01:01:33.191 --> 01:01:34.734
- Mexico.
- Latinas.

01:01:34.901 --> 01:01:36.444
Ladies...

01:01:36.611 --> 01:01:39.072
A lot of Latinas.
Ladies, let's just talk about this.

01:01:43.409 --> 01:01:45.286
- What the fuck?
- What the fuck, dude?

01:01:45.453 --> 01:01:48.414
- Where the fuck are we?
- I don't like this.

01:01:48.581 --> 01:01:51.501
- What are you freaks looking at?
- Why are we here?

01:01:51.667 --> 01:01:54.253
- What the fuck is going on right now?
- I don't want to be here.

01:01:54.420 --> 01:01:57.215
- Why aren't you guys saying anything?
- Holy shit, dude.

01:01:57.382 --> 01:01:59.675
- We are shackled.
- Why are we shackled?

01:01:59.842 --> 01:02:00.968
Why are you wearing
a fucking tube sock?

01:02:01.135 --> 01:02:02.303
Why are you wearing a sock?

01:02:02.470 --> 01:02:04.764
- They match. Whose socks are these?
- We are so fucked.

01:02:04.931 --> 01:02:07.225
Welcome to the Tribunal of Justice.

01:02:07.392 --> 01:02:08.518
What?

01:02:08.684 --> 01:02:12.522
These two men stand accused
of infiltrating our sacred home,

01:02:12.688 --> 01:02:14.816
violating the dignity
of two of our pledges,

01:02:14.982 --> 01:02:18.069
and destroying
our award-winning rose garden.

01:02:18.236 --> 01:02:19.529
Look, if I could just respond
to all that...

01:02:19.695 --> 01:02:22.782
- What sayest the sisterhood?
- Guilty as charged!

01:02:22.949 --> 01:02:25.535
OK, look,
in our country, America,

01:02:25.701 --> 01:02:27.902
usually there's like a trial
and some evidence and shit!

01:02:27.912 --> 01:02:30.498
- You're not just guilty.
- The punishment shall match the crime.

01:02:30.665 --> 01:02:32.959
The aggrieved may enter
the circle of vengeance.

01:02:33.126 --> 01:02:36.879
The circle of what? Hold on.
Holy shit, look who it is.

01:02:37.046 --> 01:02:39.841
Holy shit, these chicks
are gonna tear us up.

01:02:40.007 --> 01:02:42.885
- Assume the position.
- Wait, actually, you know what?

01:02:43.052 --> 01:02:45.972
I didn't even spank them.
That was all him. I wasn't even...

01:02:46.139 --> 01:02:47.807
- What are you...?
- Fuck you, dude. I'm sorry.

01:02:47.974 --> 01:02:49.809
Punishment grows more severe
every second you delay.

01:02:49.976 --> 01:02:52.228
- Ready, sister?
- Ready.

01:02:55.773 --> 01:02:57.024
Assume the position.

01:02:58.067 --> 01:03:00.445
- OK, OK, OK.
- Oh, my God.

01:03:02.238 --> 01:03:04.949
OK, Chantelle, I have a rare
skin condition on my upper thighs,

01:03:05.116 --> 01:03:06.617
so if you could
just avoid that area.

01:03:06.784 --> 01:03:09.036
- Oh, yeah, totally.
- Thanks, Chantelle.

01:03:09.203 --> 01:03:10.683
I'll totally watch it while I just...

01:03:10.746 --> 01:03:13.082
Oh, my God, holy shit!

01:03:13.249 --> 01:03:15.460
My God!

01:03:15.626 --> 01:03:17.837
You just had to fuck
with these girls, didn't you?

01:03:18.004 --> 01:03:19.422
Holy shit!

01:03:19.589 --> 01:03:21.674
Yeah, when a lady asks you to spank
her ass, you spank that ass!

01:03:21.841 --> 01:03:24.594
Great. You know what?
You are fucking unbelievable, man!

01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:27.096
- It's called having manners, Casey!
- Fuck my face!

01:03:27.263 --> 01:03:29.223
Enough. Turn around.

01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:32.602
It hurts. It hurts.

01:03:33.186 --> 01:03:34.228
It hurts.

01:03:35.646 --> 01:03:38.024
Look, Goat Mask Lady...

01:03:38.191 --> 01:03:39.650
Please.

01:03:39.817 --> 01:03:42.278
- I mean, like, we're really sorry.
- Yeah.

01:03:42.445 --> 01:03:44.238
We're just trying to get
our friend Jeff Chang home.

01:03:44.405 --> 01:03:46.491
- Justice has been served...
- Oh, thank God.

01:03:46.657 --> 01:03:47.825
For the first offense.

01:03:47.992 --> 01:03:50.828
- What?
- To address the second offense,

01:03:50.995 --> 01:03:52.872
the offenders will
now commence making out.

01:03:53.039 --> 01:03:54.279
- Oh, fuck! Yeah, right.
- What?

01:03:54.415 --> 01:03:55.708
You guys really
don't want to see that.

01:03:55.875 --> 01:03:57.543
That's a joke,
that's disgusting. You're weird.

01:03:57.710 --> 01:03:59.754
The longer you wait,
the longer the kiss.

01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:04.220
- Look, there's no way I'm kissing him.
- Yeah I'm sorry, that's just...

01:04:04.258 --> 01:04:06.260
All those who want to see
the offenders kiss,

01:04:06.427 --> 01:04:07.553
stomp your feet.

01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:09.472
That's unfair!
Clearly we're outnumbered.

01:04:09.639 --> 01:04:11.920
Yeah, OK, look, you guys
can stomp your feet all you want,

01:04:11.933 --> 01:04:13.573
there's no way
I'm making out with a dude!

01:04:13.684 --> 01:04:18.147
Do it. Or be forever branded
with the mark of the sisterhood.

01:04:18.314 --> 01:04:19.482
Holy shit.

01:04:19.649 --> 01:04:21.651
Dude, I can't get branded.

01:04:21.817 --> 01:04:24.862
I'm gonna like not be able
to get buried in a Jewish cemetery or...

01:04:25.029 --> 01:04:26.447
Fuck it.

01:04:27.990 --> 01:04:29.075
Really?

01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:30.910
Fuck it, dude.

01:04:34.288 --> 01:04:37.333
I just... I wish you were wearing more
than a tube sock, but fuck it, baby.

01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:39.544
I really wish you
didn't call me baby.

01:04:40.461 --> 01:04:41.546
OK.

01:04:43.172 --> 01:04:44.715
- Tongue?
- Of course, tongue.

01:04:44.882 --> 01:04:46.259
Really? You had to fucking ask
for tongue?

01:04:46.425 --> 01:04:48.052
I'm sorry, that was stupid.

01:04:56.435 --> 01:04:58.646
- Grab his boobie.
- You never even did that.

01:04:58.813 --> 01:05:00.273
Do it, offender.

01:05:09.156 --> 01:05:12.910
Dude, are you getting
a chubby right now?

01:05:13.077 --> 01:05:15.580
Dude, I can't help it. You're
actually kind of a good kisser.

01:05:16.581 --> 01:05:17.873
You know what?
I'm fucking done.

01:05:27.133 --> 01:05:29.844
- None of that ever happened.
- Ever.

01:05:31.345 --> 01:05:33.180
- Hi, how are you?
- Hi.

01:05:33.347 --> 01:05:35.516
We need to find
some clothes, man.

01:05:35.683 --> 01:05:37.852
We'll get some
at Health Services.

01:05:40.313 --> 01:05:41.731
- Thanks, dude.
- Hey.

01:05:41.897 --> 01:05:42.898
All right,
it's already 6:00 a.m.

01:05:43.065 --> 01:05:44.505
We gotta hurry up
and get Jeff Chang.

01:05:44.525 --> 01:05:47.111
Dude, if I walk any
faster my sock's gonna fall off.

01:05:48.487 --> 01:05:51.240
- This is all your fault.
- What?

01:05:51.407 --> 01:05:53.326
You made Jeff Chang go out,
got him wasted,

01:05:53.492 --> 01:05:56.370
you fucked with the Latin sorority
girls, you pulled a gun out on Randy.

01:05:56.537 --> 01:05:58.378
OK, look, you cannot pin
all this on me, Casey.

01:05:58.456 --> 01:06:00.856
You're the reason why we are
currently walking through campus

01:06:00.875 --> 01:06:02.995
at six in the morning wearing
only socks on our cocks!

01:06:03.044 --> 01:06:05.630
OK. I'm sorry for trying
to show you guys a good time.

01:06:05.796 --> 01:06:08.557
You know what, man, we're done. OK?
When this is over don't e-mail me,

01:06:08.633 --> 01:06:09.873
don't text me, don't call me...

01:06:10.009 --> 01:06:11.769
don't poke me...
you and me are fucking over!

01:06:11.844 --> 01:06:14.388
And another thing,
Sidewinder sucks!

01:06:15.890 --> 01:06:16.849
Take it back.

01:06:17.016 --> 01:06:18.696
It's hot, it's dirty,
the people are gross,

01:06:18.851 --> 01:06:20.212
and half the acts are fucking DJs.

01:06:20.353 --> 01:06:21.812
Why would I want
to spend a week of my life

01:06:21.979 --> 01:06:23.898
watching some asshole
in a pink track suit

01:06:24.065 --> 01:06:25.225
play his fucking iPod for me?

01:06:25.274 --> 01:06:26.484
Because your friends
are gonna be there...

01:06:26.651 --> 01:06:28.736
I'm not going to some
stupid fucking music festival

01:06:28.903 --> 01:06:31.783
just to preserve the illusion that
we're still friends because we're not.

01:06:31.906 --> 01:06:33.949
We're not still friends
anymore, Miller.

01:06:35.910 --> 01:06:38.204
OK. It's cool, man.

01:06:40.289 --> 01:06:42.500
So since we're not friends, I can tell
you how fucking lame you've been.

01:06:42.667 --> 01:06:44.335
I can tell you that you probably
should go to Wall Street

01:06:44.502 --> 01:06:47.338
and that you should spend the funnest
years of your life in an office.

01:06:47.505 --> 01:06:49.385
Working for the man,
wearing a cute little suit.

01:06:49.423 --> 01:06:52.176
It's called growing up, dude.
Why don't you look into it?

01:06:52.343 --> 01:06:54.383
I don't need to grow up, bro,
you need to grow down.

01:06:54.470 --> 01:06:56.430
- That's not even an expression!
- Well, today it is! OK?

01:06:56.597 --> 01:06:58.015
Do you remember what it's like
to have fun, to be cool,

01:06:58.182 --> 01:06:59.183
to give a shit
about your friends?

01:06:59.350 --> 01:07:01.102
- You've changed.
- Oh, my God.

01:07:01.268 --> 01:07:03.396
You don't have fucking balls
anymore. You're a little bitch.

01:07:03.562 --> 01:07:07.233
Well, you know what, man? You're just
the fucking same desperate, low-life,

01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:08.984
- fucking loser that you've always been.
- Yeah?

01:07:09.151 --> 01:07:12.191
- Yeah. So fucking kudos to you, man!
- Don't fucking push me. Don't start...

01:07:12.196 --> 01:07:14.116
You're a fucking dick, dude!
Fucking white trash!

01:07:14.281 --> 01:07:16.200
Fucking hands off!

01:07:16.367 --> 01:07:18.077
Yeah, take it, bitch!

01:07:18.244 --> 01:07:20.329
- Fucking asshole!
- Could fight...

01:07:22.248 --> 01:07:24.500
You fight like a girl.

01:07:33.384 --> 01:07:35.344
Health Services,
how can I direct your call?

01:07:38.597 --> 01:07:39.932
I'll call you back.

01:07:43.310 --> 01:07:45.396
Mental Health, third floor.

01:07:45.563 --> 01:07:48.315
- You're hilarious.
- We're here to pick up our friend.

01:07:48.482 --> 01:07:49.692
Name of patient?

01:07:49.859 --> 01:07:51.986
Jeffrey Reginald Chang.

01:07:52.153 --> 01:07:55.156
Plus if you had any clothes,
that would be greatly appreciated.

01:07:56.282 --> 01:07:58.743
He's here. Let me get his file.

01:07:58.909 --> 01:08:01.579
And if you could please
hurry up, we're in a rush here.

01:08:03.330 --> 01:08:05.166
Thank God I don't know
anyone at this school.

01:08:07.418 --> 01:08:08.419
Casey?

01:08:09.837 --> 01:08:12.715
Nicole. Hi.

01:08:12.882 --> 01:08:15.676
Where are your clothes?

01:08:15.843 --> 01:08:18.595
We just got jumped by some girls
It's a long story.

01:08:18.763 --> 01:08:20.514
- I bet.
- What are you doing here?

01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:23.600
Randy got mauled
by a buffalo, remember?

01:08:23.768 --> 01:08:25.770
Right, yes! How is that guy?

01:08:25.935 --> 01:08:28.606
- He's fine, I guess.
- Yeah?

01:08:28.773 --> 01:08:33.652
I mean, I came over here to check on him
and he got all agro on me again.

01:08:33.819 --> 01:08:37.198
And then, I got pissed
and we broke up.

01:08:37.363 --> 01:08:38.657
Yeah.

01:08:38.823 --> 01:08:41.035
So, we're pretty much done.

01:08:41.202 --> 01:08:43.037
Really?

01:08:43.203 --> 01:08:45.038
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, it's fine.

01:08:45.206 --> 01:08:47.124
I mean, we weren't
really that serious.

01:08:47.291 --> 01:08:50.044
- But, still, I mean...
- Yeah, it was a long time coming.

01:08:50.211 --> 01:08:51.462
- OK.
- Anyway...

01:08:51.629 --> 01:08:54.965
it looks like I'm going
to South America by myself now, so...

01:08:55.131 --> 01:08:56.759
Oh, right, the trip.

01:08:56.926 --> 01:08:58.803
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, no, I'm still going.

01:08:58.969 --> 01:08:59.970
Cool.

01:09:00.136 --> 01:09:03.765
Yeah, my flight leaves
in a few hours, so...

01:09:05.559 --> 01:09:07.520
I guess this is goodbye.

01:09:14.484 --> 01:09:15.653
OK.

01:09:16.319 --> 01:09:17.446
Bye.

01:09:20.073 --> 01:09:22.368
- Can I go with you?
- No thanks, I'm good.

01:09:22.535 --> 01:09:24.078
OK, well, whenever
you're not good,

01:09:24.245 --> 01:09:26.205
I'll be right here,
reading Perfect Bride.

01:09:27.497 --> 01:09:29.917
<i>What, I can't read
Perfect Bride, bro?</i>

01:09:31.836 --> 01:09:34.212
I'm sorry, Jeffrey Chang
is on 24-hour hold.

01:09:34.380 --> 01:09:36.215
He can't be released
until tomorrow morning.

01:09:36.381 --> 01:09:37.800
- What?
- No, he's gotta be home by 7:00 a.m.

01:09:37.966 --> 01:09:40.176
- Why is he on hold?
- It's confidential.

01:09:40.344 --> 01:09:41.863
It's confidential, Casey.
Give me that.

01:09:41.886 --> 01:09:45.599
Hey! Give that back immediately!
Give me that! You, stop!

01:09:45.765 --> 01:09:47.350
My God, look how many times
he's been in here, man.

01:09:47.518 --> 01:09:49.435
Give that back to me,
you little shit!

01:09:50.604 --> 01:09:52.064
Oh, my God.

01:09:52.231 --> 01:09:54.316
"Patient was brought in
for attempted murder.

01:09:54.483 --> 01:09:58.404
Later determined his weapon
misfired during a suicide attempt."

01:09:58.571 --> 01:10:00.656
Jeff Chang tried
to commit suicide?

01:10:02.491 --> 01:10:04.368
Get out. Now!

01:10:10.207 --> 01:10:12.042
Dude, what the fuck is going on?

01:10:13.419 --> 01:10:16.130
I mean, Jeff Chang
was always the happy one.

01:10:16.297 --> 01:10:19.174
What were we supposed to do?
He didn't tell us anything.

01:10:19.341 --> 01:10:22.261
Dude, look, fuck that. OK?

01:10:22.428 --> 01:10:25.973
We are his best friends, and he felt
like he couldn't even call us.

01:10:26.974 --> 01:10:28.183
That sucks.

01:10:29.518 --> 01:10:30.686
We suck.

01:10:34.523 --> 01:10:35.983
What happened, man?

01:10:36.984 --> 01:10:38.777
We used to be so close and...

01:10:39.486 --> 01:10:40.988
Fuck.

01:10:44.491 --> 01:10:46.827
- Thanks, Erin.
- No problem, Gary. See you next time.

01:10:48.704 --> 01:10:51.040
Jesus, not The Chief again.

01:10:51.206 --> 01:10:52.875
What's up, Chief?

01:10:53.042 --> 01:10:55.002
Hey, dudes. How was your night?

01:10:55.169 --> 01:10:57.338
- Pretty terrible, actually.
- Tell me about it.

01:10:57.504 --> 01:11:00.090
I ripped two sheets of LSD
and spent the whole night

01:11:00.257 --> 01:11:02.593
dancing in front of my house again.

01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:04.553
Now I gotta go teach.

01:11:09.850 --> 01:11:11.518
Wait. Did The Chief just say

01:11:11.685 --> 01:11:13.765
he was dancing in front of his house
the whole night?

01:11:13.812 --> 01:11:15.564
- Yeah, so what?
- That's it!

01:11:15.731 --> 01:11:17.171
- What's it?
- Oh, my God, that's it!

01:11:17.274 --> 01:11:18.317
What's it?
What are you talking about?

01:11:18.484 --> 01:11:19.693
OK. So, the first time
we saw The Chief

01:11:19.860 --> 01:11:21.111
was in front
of Jeff Chang's place, right?

01:11:21.278 --> 01:11:22.988
And then we saw him
like nine more times.

01:11:23.155 --> 01:11:25.532
Right, and we thought that he was
just wandering around campus all night,

01:11:25.699 --> 01:11:28.452
just like we were.
But what if he wasn't?

01:11:28.619 --> 01:11:32.247
What if The Chief was
in the exact same place the entire time?

01:11:32.414 --> 01:11:35.542
Then that would mean we walked past
Jeff Chang's place a dozen times.

01:11:35.709 --> 01:11:37.510
- Oh, my God!
- Yes, and that's why Jeff Chang

01:11:37.544 --> 01:11:38.671
kept mumbling those Indian chants.

01:11:38.837 --> 01:11:40.547
It was because he was trying
to tell us where he lived.

01:11:40.714 --> 01:11:42.257
It's like The Da Vinci Code
except it makes sense.

01:11:42.424 --> 01:11:45.304
Oh, my God, we are officially the two
biggest morons in the entire world.

01:11:45.344 --> 01:11:47.513
Yeah. Hey, Chief,
where do you live?

01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:50.557
- Fifth and Broadway.
- Fifth and Broadway.

01:11:50.724 --> 01:11:52.226
All right, so wait,
here's what we gotta do.

01:11:52.393 --> 01:11:53.811
- We gotta break Jeff Chang out.
- Break him out.

01:11:53.978 --> 01:11:56.146
- Get him home, gotta get him sober...
- Sober him up.

01:11:56.313 --> 01:11:57.481
And then we gotta
get him showered and dressed

01:11:57.648 --> 01:12:00.442
before his dad shows up,
which is in 36 minutes.

01:12:00.609 --> 01:12:03.153
- That sounds totally impossible.
- Yeah?

01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:04.446
Well, I'm not gonna let
Jeff Chang down again.

01:12:04.613 --> 01:12:06.281
No, let's get that
little fucker home.

01:12:07.074 --> 01:12:08.784
Wait, wait.
Are we best friends again?

01:12:08.951 --> 01:12:10.703
- No.
- Right. No, I'm not either.

01:12:10.869 --> 01:12:11.704
Cool.

01:12:15.708 --> 01:12:18.252
Hey, hey, you can't be in here!

01:12:19.628 --> 01:12:20.963
- Jeff Chang!
- Jeff Chang!

01:12:21.130 --> 01:12:22.381
- Jeff Chang!
- God, God!

01:12:24.508 --> 01:12:26.260
- Jeff Chang!
- Jeff Chang!

01:12:26.427 --> 01:12:28.637
Have you seen a little Asian
with shit on his face? No? Thank you.

01:12:28.804 --> 01:12:30.264
- Jeff Chang!
- Jeff Chang!

01:12:30.431 --> 01:12:32.558
- Hey, he's in here!
- Nice!

01:12:32.725 --> 01:12:34.226
We're gonna break you out,
buddy.

01:12:34.393 --> 01:12:35.853
- Jeff Chang!
- He's barely coherent.

01:12:37.271 --> 01:12:38.605
Man, how're we gonna
get him outta here?

01:12:38.772 --> 01:12:40.691
There's like orderlies everywhere!

01:12:40.858 --> 01:12:43.485
Casey.
I just had an awesome idea.

01:12:43.652 --> 01:12:45.779
This is definitely
not an awesome idea.

01:12:45.946 --> 01:12:47.906
It'll be fine.
I've done this a thousand times.

01:12:48.073 --> 01:12:49.491
No, that's what you said last time.

01:12:49.658 --> 01:12:52.286
Hey, you gotta trust me.
Now bring him a little to the left. OK.

01:12:52.453 --> 01:12:54.038
No, no, we gotta
pull him back up.

01:12:54.204 --> 01:12:56.373
That's the Spirit Mobile.
It's super tall.

01:12:56.540 --> 01:12:58.876
- I don't like this ride, guys.
- No, it's too far down!

01:12:59.043 --> 01:13:01.324
- Pull him back up!
- OK. You're right. Let's pull him up.

01:13:01.336 --> 01:13:02.296
- Oh, shit!
- Miller!

01:13:04.673 --> 01:13:07.676
Oh, my God!
Did we just kill Jeff Chang again?

01:13:12.181 --> 01:13:14.892
- Where's...? Where's the Spirit Mobile?
- I don't know. It was right here.

01:13:15.059 --> 01:13:17.311
Oh, no. Did they drive off
with Jeff Chang on it?

01:13:17.478 --> 01:13:18.771
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

01:13:18.937 --> 01:13:21.648
I thought it was only 20 feet.
How am I supposed to know?

01:13:26.653 --> 01:13:28.113
Come on, guys.
Get in. We're late.

01:13:29.323 --> 01:13:31.575
- What the fuck?
- Randy, look!

01:13:31.742 --> 01:13:33.535
It's the guys who stole
your smart phone.

01:13:33.702 --> 01:13:35.454
- Fuckers.
- Why are they taking your truck, Randy?

01:13:35.621 --> 01:13:38.248
- Get out of the Spirit Mobile!
- Oh shit! Go, go, go!

01:13:39.208 --> 01:13:40.167
- Go!
- You're dead!

01:13:40.334 --> 01:13:41.585
Hey!

01:13:44.088 --> 01:13:47.341
- Bitch.
- Hey, what was that all about?

01:13:47.508 --> 01:13:49.349
Don't worry about it,
just drive, drive, drive.

01:13:49.843 --> 01:13:52.096
- How'd you even start the car?
- The keys were in the ignition.

01:13:52.262 --> 01:13:55.057
Fuck! I'm so late.
My dad's gonna kill me.

01:14:09.113 --> 01:14:12.616
Hey, why is there a teddy bear
glued to my penis?

01:14:12.783 --> 01:14:15.035
No idea, no idea
how that could have happened.

01:14:15.202 --> 01:14:16.870
I miss you guys.

01:14:17.037 --> 01:14:18.914
How come we never
hang out anymore?

01:14:19.289 --> 01:14:21.041
- Wrong lane, wrong lane!
- Wrong lane!

01:14:21.208 --> 01:14:23.544
You're in the wrong lane!

01:14:25.379 --> 01:14:27.540
Oh, my God, Jeff Chang,
you're fucking crazy right now!

01:14:27.548 --> 01:14:28.748
I feel really alert right now.

01:14:28.757 --> 01:14:30.259
- I feel like Spider-Man.
- What?

01:14:30.425 --> 01:14:32.761
I just really wish I had my contacts on.

01:14:32.928 --> 01:14:33.971
- Oh, my God!
- Fuck!

01:14:34.138 --> 01:14:36.890
Parking meter, parking meter,
parking meter...!

01:14:38.433 --> 01:14:41.311
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!
Oh, my God, oh, my God...

01:14:41.478 --> 01:14:44.189
Oh, shit! What are you doing?
What are you doing?

01:14:51.905 --> 01:14:53.782
Hit the brake, dude.
Dude, hit the brake! Hit the brake!

01:14:53.949 --> 01:14:55.033
- No, stop!
- Dude, do it!

01:14:55.200 --> 01:14:57.411
Get off!

01:15:01.707 --> 01:15:03.667
Look, I don't want to die.
I want to go back to college.

01:15:03.834 --> 01:15:06.378
I want to go to Alaska, I want
to make out with a black chick!

01:15:06.545 --> 01:15:08.547
- I wanna fuck Casey's sister!
- What?

01:15:08.714 --> 01:15:10.340
- You dropped out of school?
- Yeah!

01:15:10.507 --> 01:15:12.009
Why would you do that, Miller?

01:15:12.176 --> 01:15:14.428
Turn around and drive the car, please!

01:15:18.557 --> 01:15:21.393
Oh, my God, we're going to jail.
We're going to jail.

01:15:23.020 --> 01:15:24.980
- I can shake them, no problem.
- No, don't shake them.

01:15:25.147 --> 01:15:26.857
Don't shake them!

01:15:27.024 --> 01:15:29.276
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:15:29.443 --> 01:15:31.528
We're not on the street anymore.
This is not where cars go.

01:15:31.695 --> 01:15:33.780
Cars don't go here.
Cars don't go here, Jeff Chang!

01:15:37.993 --> 01:15:39.453
Oh, my God. Are your eyes open?

01:15:39.620 --> 01:15:40.996
- Fuck you.
- I can't tell.

01:15:41.163 --> 01:15:44.458
- Oh, no. Oh, my God.
- Out of my way, nerds!

01:15:46.460 --> 01:15:47.794
Hey, did you see that guy?

01:15:49.463 --> 01:15:51.048
Casey, we need to neutralize the target

01:15:51.215 --> 01:15:52.966
'cause he doesn't know
what the fuck's going on right now.

01:15:53.133 --> 01:15:55.052
- Come on, guys.
- Shit, shit, shit.

01:16:10.817 --> 01:16:13.987
Yeah, maybe I shouldn't be driving.

01:16:29.378 --> 01:16:33.423
It's 6:51, we have nine minutes to clean
him up before his dad gets here.

01:16:33.590 --> 01:16:34.424
Guys, my back hurts.

01:16:34.591 --> 01:16:36.218
Yeah, we threw you out
a third-story window onto a SUV.

01:16:36.385 --> 01:16:38.345
- What? Why would you do that?
- You told us to.

01:16:38.512 --> 01:16:39.680
Why would I say that?

01:16:39.846 --> 01:16:40.973
Because we're your best friends.
We love you.

01:16:41.139 --> 01:16:42.419
Get him in the house!
Get him in!

01:16:44.643 --> 01:16:45.811
What do we do about the bear?

01:16:45.978 --> 01:16:47.604
I don't know, man, just fucking
hold him or something.

01:16:47.771 --> 01:16:49.606
- Oh, my God.
- Let's go.

01:16:49.773 --> 01:16:52.192
- Holy shit! What are you doing?
- Pull harder.

01:16:52.359 --> 01:16:54.861
- I don't want to rip his dick off!
- I don't want that either!

01:16:55.028 --> 01:16:56.708
- Fuck you!
- Seriously, pull harder, dude!

01:16:56.863 --> 01:16:59.324
I don't know, man, Jeff Chang has
a super stretchy penis!

01:16:59.491 --> 01:17:01.910
- Pull harder, dude!
- I'm trying to!

01:17:02.077 --> 01:17:04.037
Fucking come on!

01:17:05.330 --> 01:17:07.374
Oh, my God!

01:17:08.375 --> 01:17:10.252
Dude, we just circumcised Jeff Chang.

01:17:10.419 --> 01:17:12.796
- Who cares? Get him in the bathroom.
- Come on, buddy!

01:17:22.723 --> 01:17:24.891
Dude, I can't believe
we actually pulled this off.

01:17:25.058 --> 01:17:26.810
Yeah, of course we did, man,
we're fucking awesome.

01:17:26.977 --> 01:17:29.771
- Small arms.
- Whatever. Come on.

01:17:29.938 --> 01:17:32.399
- There we go.
- I don't know if I can do this.

01:17:32.566 --> 01:17:34.735
- What are you talking about?
- Yeah, what do you mean?

01:17:34.901 --> 01:17:37.738
I mean, like, I don't know
if I want go to med school

01:17:37.904 --> 01:17:39.740
or be a doctor or any of it.

01:17:42.284 --> 01:17:44.578
- Now you fucking tell us?
- Miller, shut up.

01:17:44.745 --> 01:17:46.747
No, dude, are you serious?
I fucking kissed a guy for you!

01:17:46.913 --> 01:17:47.914
- Miller!
- What?

01:17:48.081 --> 01:17:50.917
Yeah, I kissed Casey.
It was fucking gross.

01:17:51.084 --> 01:17:52.544
- Yeah.
- Miller, shut up.

01:17:52.711 --> 01:17:53.712
- What?
- Let him talk.

01:17:53.879 --> 01:17:56.631
Look, I'm sort of losing
my shit up here.

01:17:59.343 --> 01:18:01.803
We heard that you tried to off yourself.

01:18:01.970 --> 01:18:04.222
- Miller, really?
- What?

01:18:04.389 --> 01:18:06.141
- Why'd you do it, man?
- I didn't.

01:18:06.308 --> 01:18:09.853
- So then, what...?
- I mean, I did, sort of. I...

01:18:10.020 --> 01:18:12.773
I was up for 72 hours studying.
I was cracked out on pills.

01:18:12.939 --> 01:18:15.192
I was literally
hallucinating in my room,

01:18:15.359 --> 01:18:17.027
but I didn't actually try to...

01:18:17.194 --> 01:18:19.196
Right.
I do weird shit when I hallucinate too.

01:18:19.363 --> 01:18:20.655
Yeah.

01:18:21.907 --> 01:18:24.034
- You know?
- The doctors say I'm not suicidal.

01:18:24.201 --> 01:18:26.578
They just think I'm fucking
stressed out of my mind.

01:18:26.745 --> 01:18:28.497
- I mean, you guys know my dad.
- Yeah.

01:18:28.663 --> 01:18:31.458
Yeah. He's been
riding me my whole life

01:18:31.625 --> 01:18:34.503
to go to med school and be
a doctor, but I hate medicine.

01:18:34.669 --> 01:18:37.923
I suck in science.
I'm fucking miserable.

01:18:38.090 --> 01:18:40.133
- So, don't do it.
- Yeah. Fuck it.

01:18:40.300 --> 01:18:43.136
Oh, shit, he's here. What should I do?

01:18:43.303 --> 01:18:45.423
Honestly, I think you
have to tell him the truth, man.

01:18:45.472 --> 01:18:47.015
I think that's pretty obvious
to everybody in this room.

01:18:47.182 --> 01:18:49.518
- You gotta tell him the truth.
- Oh, my God, you guys are so white.

01:18:49.684 --> 01:18:51.436
What?
Dude, that's really racist.

01:18:51.603 --> 01:18:53.243
Yeah. White people
have feelings too, man.

01:18:53.397 --> 01:18:54.856
I can't just tell him the truth.

01:18:55.023 --> 01:18:57.943
I come from like five generations
of doctors. I'm the first-born son.

01:18:58.110 --> 01:19:00.153
This is what's expected of me.

01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:03.907
Fuck!

01:19:04.074 --> 01:19:06.952
Dude, it's the rest of your life, man.
Stop being such a fucking pussy.

01:19:07.994 --> 01:19:09.955
He's your dad, dude.
He'll understand.

01:19:10.122 --> 01:19:11.748
- I promise.
- Yeah.

01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:19.714
- Holy shit!
- What the fuck?

01:19:19.881 --> 01:19:21.425
You just got rocked, boy!

01:19:21.591 --> 01:19:22.968
- You OK, buddy?
- What?

01:19:23.135 --> 01:19:25.095
- Bat me.
- That was so hot, Randy.

01:19:25.262 --> 01:19:28.306
Look, man, we're sorry that we stole
your truck, but like, calm down, man.

01:19:28.473 --> 01:19:32.185
No, this isn't about my truck.

01:19:32.352 --> 01:19:33.395
- OK! OK!
- Chill, chill!

01:19:33.562 --> 01:19:36.022
That lamp will
never work again, Randy!

01:19:36.189 --> 01:19:38.358
- Yeah!
- OK, OK, OK, what is this about?

01:19:38.525 --> 01:19:41.069
- Is this about your phone?
- Right, OK, we're sorry, Randy,

01:19:41.236 --> 01:19:43.029
that we stole your truck
and your cell phone.

01:19:43.196 --> 01:19:47.367
- This ain't about my phone neither.
- Wait!

01:19:47.534 --> 01:19:48.910
- Stop!
- Bitch!

01:19:49.077 --> 01:19:50.579
That's my fucking boom box, man.

01:19:50.745 --> 01:19:52.831
- What is it about? Is it about Nicole?
- Calm down!

01:19:52.998 --> 01:19:54.799
Oh, my God, you didn't
even close with Nicole.

01:19:54.958 --> 01:19:56.358
Yeah, but I was really close,
right?

01:19:56.460 --> 01:19:58.044
No, there's no such thing as
almost fucking his girlfriend.

01:19:58.211 --> 01:20:00.380
You either fucked his girlfriend
or you didn't.

01:20:00.547 --> 01:20:02.132
- Stop talking, assholes!
- He didn't fuck your girlfriend!

01:20:02.299 --> 01:20:03.717
- No, no, no, no.
- He didn't fuck your girlfriend!

01:20:03.884 --> 01:20:05.564
- That's what I'm saying.
- Is this a joke?

01:20:05.635 --> 01:20:06.803
I almost... I almost did.

01:20:06.970 --> 01:20:09.389
Then you've almost
fucked every girl you know.

01:20:09.556 --> 01:20:11.933
This is not about my truck
or my phone...

01:20:12.100 --> 01:20:14.728
or... my... girl!

01:20:14.895 --> 01:20:16.521
- That's my laptop!
- Fuck your laptop!

01:20:16.688 --> 01:20:18.398
Get a desktop, bitch!

01:20:18.565 --> 01:20:21.234
You know what? This is definitely
about the dart in the face.

01:20:21.401 --> 01:20:23.904
Honestly, I completely forgot about
the dart in your face. Are you OK?

01:20:24.070 --> 01:20:25.911
- He's had a really rough night too.
- Shut up!

01:20:25.989 --> 01:20:28.617
Come on, Randy! Do what I said,
fuck me in the ass, Randy!

01:20:29.951 --> 01:20:31.870
What?

01:20:32.370 --> 01:20:34.623
I mean, fuck them in the ass!
Just...

01:20:34.789 --> 01:20:38.710
- What...
- The hell is going on here?

01:20:38.877 --> 01:20:40.003
- Oh, shit.
- Fuck.

01:20:40.170 --> 01:20:42.797
- Who the fuck is this guy?
- Hey.

01:20:42.964 --> 01:20:45.675
I'm Jeffrey's father.
Who the fuck are you?

01:20:46.801 --> 01:20:47.928
I'm Randy.

01:20:48.094 --> 01:20:49.930
- He's Randy.
- That's Randy.

01:20:51.640 --> 01:20:55.101
OK, Randy... I'm here to take my son
to his interview.

01:20:55.268 --> 01:20:58.308
Well, he's not going with you, so why
don't you just get the fuck outta here?

01:20:59.189 --> 01:21:03.109
Oh, no, he's definitely
coming with me.

01:21:03.276 --> 01:21:04.319
Oh, shit.

01:21:04.486 --> 01:21:07.864
Look, old man... don't make me
beat you in front of your son.

01:21:08.031 --> 01:21:09.115
I wouldn't do that.

01:21:12.494 --> 01:21:14.079
- Holy shit!
- Shit!

01:21:15.789 --> 01:21:17.457
That's what fucking happens, man.

01:21:17.624 --> 01:21:20.877
Oh, your dad's a dick.
Oh, my arm.

01:21:21.044 --> 01:21:21.920
You should probably stay down.

01:21:22.087 --> 01:21:23.129
Let's go!

01:21:24.965 --> 01:21:27.300
OK, you need to tell him that you
don't want to be a doctor right now.

01:21:27.467 --> 01:21:28.927
I don't think this is a good time.

01:21:29.094 --> 01:21:30.814
- Just fucking tell him.
- No. You tell him.

01:21:30.929 --> 01:21:31.972
- No, no, no.
- I'm not fucking telling him.

01:21:32.138 --> 01:21:33.598
- You fucking tell him.
- You fucking tell him.

01:21:33.765 --> 01:21:35.517
- You're not a pussy.
- I am a pussy.

01:21:35.684 --> 01:21:37.143
- Tell him right now.
- Let's go, Jeffrey.

01:21:37.310 --> 01:21:38.937
Holy shit...

01:21:45.860 --> 01:21:47.362
No, I'm not going.

01:21:47.529 --> 01:21:49.197
What the hell are you talking about?

01:21:49.364 --> 01:21:50.685
I don't want to go to med school.

01:21:50.782 --> 01:21:52.826
- I don't want to be a doctor.
- Jeffrey.

01:21:52.993 --> 01:21:54.633
I'm not...
No, I'm not a kid anymore, Dad.

01:21:54.703 --> 01:21:59.040
I'm 21 years old and...
from here on out,

01:21:59.207 --> 01:22:01.408
I'm gonna decide what I do
with my life and that's that.

01:22:02.502 --> 01:22:05.342
What are you gonna do? Throw me off
a roof? These guys already did that.

01:22:09.259 --> 01:22:10.510
OK.

01:22:12.178 --> 01:22:13.221
I get it.

01:22:14.723 --> 01:22:17.017
- See, I told you he'd understand, man.
- I get it.

01:22:17.183 --> 01:22:19.728
You're even dumber
than I thought.

01:22:19.894 --> 01:22:22.230
- Get in the goddamn car, Jeffrey.
- No. No.

01:22:22.397 --> 01:22:25.775
- You ungrateful little shit.
- Dad!

01:22:25.942 --> 01:22:29.029
I can't believe I raised a worthless
piece of shit like you...

01:22:29.195 --> 01:22:30.780
Oh, shit! Dude, what?

01:22:30.947 --> 01:22:32.387
- That's my friend!
- Miller! Miller!

01:22:32.490 --> 01:22:35.243
- That's my friend, dude.
- Just calm down.

01:22:38.079 --> 01:22:39.414
No, Dad.

01:22:41.541 --> 01:22:42.917
Why don't you just leave?

01:22:44.461 --> 01:22:45.795
Just leave.

01:22:47.881 --> 01:22:49.049
Now.

01:22:58.642 --> 01:23:00.143
Yeah,

01:23:00.310 --> 01:23:01.710
you just punched
my dad in the face.

01:23:01.811 --> 01:23:04.105
I know. It felt good, though.

01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:08.735
Hey, man.

01:23:11.279 --> 01:23:13.031
My dad's a dick, too.

01:23:13.198 --> 01:23:16.242
I... I'm sorry I broke
your apartment.

01:23:18.161 --> 01:23:19.412
What the fuck is this?

01:23:22.666 --> 01:23:24.459
Just listen to your heart.

01:23:26.044 --> 01:23:29.589
- Listen to your heart.
- Yeah. All right, man. OK.

01:23:32.467 --> 01:23:35.762
- Nice apology, Randy.
- That was heartfelt, Randy.

01:23:37.097 --> 01:23:39.224
See ya, guys!

01:23:40.892 --> 01:23:43.311
- Who are those guys?
- Those guys are the weirdest guys.

01:23:43.478 --> 01:23:45.063
- They're so weird.
- Yeah.

01:23:47.982 --> 01:23:50.694
- Dude, another good birthday.
- Yeah.

01:23:50.860 --> 01:23:53.238
Yeah.

01:23:53.405 --> 01:23:55.281
So, what are you gonna do now?

01:23:55.448 --> 01:23:58.618
God, I don't know. You know,
I can do whatever the fuck I want.

01:23:58.785 --> 01:24:02.205
You know, for once in my life, I don't
have to do what other people tell me.

01:24:03.707 --> 01:24:07.085
I'm just gonna travel
and write music again and...

01:24:07.252 --> 01:24:09.838
Fuck it. You know,
I'm just gonna live my life.

01:24:10.672 --> 01:24:11.673
Yeah.

01:24:13.550 --> 01:24:15.051
I'm glad you guys came.

01:24:15.218 --> 01:24:17.095
Seriously, thanks for
being such good friends.

01:24:17.262 --> 01:24:18.471
Yeah, dude.

01:24:19.931 --> 01:24:21.307
Me and Casey will always
be there for you.

01:24:21.474 --> 01:24:24.394
- I gotta go.
- What?

01:24:24.561 --> 01:24:28.690
- Sorry, just... I'll call you.
- Yeah, way to ruin the moment, dick!

01:24:28.857 --> 01:24:33.445
Love you guys! Good job standing
up to your dad, Jeff Chang!

01:24:33.611 --> 01:24:36.322
My fucking dick hurts.

01:24:46.791 --> 01:24:50.044
Nicole, Nicole! Wait, wait.
No, no, no! Stop, stop!

01:24:50.211 --> 01:24:51.546
Don't go! Don't...

01:24:51.713 --> 01:24:54.382
God damn it! Fuck.

01:24:58.219 --> 01:24:59.387
Fuck.

01:25:01.389 --> 01:25:03.641
Why are you yelling
at my roommate?

01:25:06.811 --> 01:25:07.812
But...

01:25:09.731 --> 01:25:12.442
- Hey.
- I lent her my car while I'm traveling.

01:25:13.610 --> 01:25:15.737
That's great.

01:25:17.864 --> 01:25:20.533
Was there something
you wanted to ask me?

01:25:20.700 --> 01:25:22.869
Yes. Yeah.

01:26:23.555 --> 01:26:27.183
<i>God, look at all these freaks.
I love this!</i>

01:26:27.350 --> 01:26:29.018
All right, guys, but seriously,
tomorrow at 9:00 a.m.,

01:26:29.185 --> 01:26:30.854
I have my big admissions
interview at Northern.

01:26:31.020 --> 01:26:32.260
So don't let me get too stupid.

01:26:32.939 --> 01:26:34.607
I'm so psyched you're
going back to college, dude.

01:26:34.774 --> 01:26:35.984
- Yeah.
- But seriously,

01:26:36.150 --> 01:26:39.445
don't let me get too messed up.
It's really important to me.

01:26:39.612 --> 01:26:41.281
- Of course, man.
- OK.

01:26:41.447 --> 01:26:42.615
- We'll take care of you, dude.
- Yeah.

01:26:42.782 --> 01:26:44.367
- OK.
- Yeah.

01:26:44.534 --> 01:26:46.327
You're our little baby tonight.

01:26:57.964 --> 01:27:00.216
Shit, shit, shit!

01:27:00.383 --> 01:27:02.385
Shit, I am so fucking late!

01:27:04.470 --> 01:27:07.849
I am so sorry that I'm late,
this is not like me.

01:27:08.016 --> 01:27:09.475
This is actually
very unprofessional.

01:27:09.642 --> 01:27:12.020
You would not believe
what happened to me last night.

01:27:12.186 --> 01:27:15.857
I've been taking my academics really
serious lately so this is a shock to me.

01:27:16.024 --> 01:27:18.818
But I'm very serious about this
university, I want you to know that.

01:27:18.985 --> 01:27:22.530
- You know, I'm just trying to...
- Hey, man, how you doin'?

01:27:22.697 --> 01:27:26.367
No way. Oh, my God! Chief!

01:27:26.534 --> 01:27:29.746
Dude, you look like shit!

01:27:30.305 --> 01:27:36.359
