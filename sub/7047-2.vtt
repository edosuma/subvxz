WEBVTT

00:02.211 --> 00:03.836
Previously on Justified...

00:03.921 --> 00:05.922
This is supreme bullshit.

00:08.300 --> 00:11.094
You do know that we're not allowed
to shoot people on sight anymore?

00:11.178 --> 00:13.054
I'm gonna reassign you.
Eastern District of Kentucky.

00:13.138 --> 00:14.180
I don't wanna go back there.

00:14.264 --> 00:17.016
- Still got family here in Kentucky?
- Ex-wife here.

00:17.226 --> 00:18.935
Next time I see you, I'm gonna...

00:19.812 --> 00:21.229
Fire in the hole!

00:22.564 --> 00:24.357
How well did you know Boyd Crowder?

00:24.441 --> 00:26.401
Boyd and I dug coal together
when we were 19.

00:26.485 --> 00:28.945
Did you know Boyd's brother?
The girl he married, Ava.

00:29.029 --> 00:32.073
She ended the union last night with a.30-06.

00:32.156 --> 00:35.952
I had a crush on you
from the time I was 12 years old.

00:36.036 --> 00:37.537
...that you get out of Harlan County
by tomorrow noon

00:37.621 --> 00:39.497
- or I'm gonna come looking for you.
- Now you're talking.

00:43.377 --> 00:46.379
I guess I just never thought of myself
as an angry man.

00:46.463 --> 00:50.550
Honestly, you're the angriest man
I have ever known.

01:10.946 --> 01:13.156
Looks like it hurts.

01:13.240 --> 01:16.159
Why, yes, Raylan. Thank you for noticing.

01:16.994 --> 01:19.620
Somebody shot me in the chest
the other day.

01:20.414 --> 01:22.123
You getting something for the pain?

01:22.499 --> 01:26.586
Well, I can goose it as needed,
but I've been holding off.

01:27.629 --> 01:29.547
I was hoping that you'd stop by.

01:30.215 --> 01:34.969
I wanted my mind clear and my mouth
not all full of rubber when I saw you.

01:37.431 --> 01:38.473
Let's hear it.

01:38.557 --> 01:41.934
- What do you think I'm gonna say, Raylan?
- I wouldn't know.

01:45.022 --> 01:50.026
You know, if Ava hadn't come in that room
and distracted me with that rifle,

01:51.403 --> 01:53.362
you think I could have got you first?

01:53.614 --> 01:56.324
- I don't know.
- Well, it don't matter.

01:56.909 --> 02:00.036
The real question is, why didn't you kill me?

02:03.624 --> 02:05.666
Did you miss my heart on purpose?

02:07.252 --> 02:11.130
No. I was aiming to kill.
That's the way I was taught.

02:12.216 --> 02:14.133
Sometimes you don't hit the bull's-eye.

02:14.510 --> 02:16.260
No, I suppose not.

02:17.513 --> 02:21.057
But, you see, I have this belief,

02:21.266 --> 02:24.435
this conviction
that it wasn't just an accident

02:24.978 --> 02:28.856
and that, I was wondering
if the fact that we were friends,

02:29.733 --> 02:31.776
if that played any part.

02:32.569 --> 02:37.156
Then last night I woke up,
and I knew why you didn't kill me.

02:38.534 --> 02:41.786
I was laying here in pain,

02:42.830 --> 02:44.372
in awful pain.

02:45.332 --> 02:47.416
But I didn't hit the pump

02:48.252 --> 02:52.046
because I knew it wasn't just
pain from a gunshot wound.

02:52.130 --> 02:56.050
It was something deeper.
It was a pain from my very soul.

02:57.803 --> 02:59.637
And I realized that,

03:00.389 --> 03:04.100
well, I couldn't any more blame you
for my situation here

03:04.184 --> 03:07.937
than a farmer could blame his neighbor
for a hailstorm.

03:08.272 --> 03:10.731
A hailstorm being an act of God.

03:11.775 --> 03:12.942
That's right, Raylan.

03:13.569 --> 03:15.945
Me shooting you was an act of God?

03:16.113 --> 03:19.907
Well, God was acting through you, Raylan,
through your gun,

03:20.868 --> 03:25.037
to get my attention,
to set me on a new course.

03:26.290 --> 03:31.127
Now, I know not yet what his will for me is,
but I have faith. I have faith

03:31.962 --> 03:35.381
that the path will be illuminated before me
as I need it to be.

03:35.632 --> 03:39.594
For even through this searing pain,
I am at peace.

03:41.138 --> 03:44.807
For I am born again
in the eyes of the Lord, Raylan.

03:45.726 --> 03:49.395
And I wanted to thank you
for playing your part.

03:52.482 --> 03:54.650
Now, if you will excuse me,

03:55.819 --> 03:59.488
I must tend to the needs of the flesh.
You understand?

04:06.288 --> 04:07.496
Raylan?

04:08.749 --> 04:12.001
Did you come all the way out here
just to see me?

04:14.171 --> 04:15.963
What do you think?

04:17.507 --> 04:21.344
Initial here, here, and here. Stand up.

04:22.346 --> 04:23.429
How come?

04:23.764 --> 04:27.600
We're gonna play pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey.
Just stand up.

04:28.477 --> 04:31.020
Come through and stand on the feet.

04:34.024 --> 04:36.359
You got your feet on backwards?

04:36.944 --> 04:38.361
Turn around.

04:41.323 --> 04:44.033
Just checking you for visible injury.

04:45.535 --> 04:47.787
- All's I see is the nose.
- Which I got

04:47.871 --> 04:50.873
when he hit me with a shotgun barrel
for no good reason.

04:50.958 --> 04:53.376
- Is that how you remember it?
- You should thank him.

04:53.627 --> 04:56.462
That nose's the only reason
you got to spend two days here

04:56.546 --> 04:58.839
instead of going straight to Big Sandy.

04:59.007 --> 05:00.549
Hey, careful with the teeth.

05:00.884 --> 05:02.385
You got any more Marshals in the car?

05:02.469 --> 05:06.722
- Task force is undermanned, just me.
- Want to put him in leg irons?

05:09.059 --> 05:11.310
I think I can handle Mr. Crowe.

05:19.653 --> 05:22.238
Marshals drive Lincolns now?

05:22.864 --> 05:24.865
Or is this confiscated?

05:25.826 --> 05:27.576
Yeah, I had a Town Car myself one time

05:27.661 --> 05:30.329
when I was down
visiting Cousin Dale in Florida,

05:30.414 --> 05:34.000
till I sold it for parts
and went to work at Disney's.

05:34.084 --> 05:37.253
You know what I tried out for?
To play Goofy...

05:38.714 --> 05:40.548
Mickey Mouse's friend.

05:43.343 --> 05:47.179
Only, you had to water-ski.
I couldn't get the hang of that,

05:47.264 --> 05:49.181
so they put me selling ice cream.

05:49.266 --> 05:52.184
But Disney's got a lot of Negroes
and homosexuals working there,

05:52.269 --> 05:54.687
- so I came back home.
- If you're gonna talk,

05:54.771 --> 05:57.356
I'm gonna put you in the trunk,
and I'll drive myself.

06:00.694 --> 06:03.946
You grew up in Harlan, huh?
I grew up in Corbin.

06:05.532 --> 06:09.118
You ready for this?
My dad has never been outside of Kentucky.

06:09.244 --> 06:14.206
Whole life, never been closer to the border
than Parisville, where he is now.

06:14.291 --> 06:17.460
You know, we're gonna be going by there.

06:17.544 --> 06:22.631
If we was to get off on Route 9,
we could stop by and see him.

06:23.592 --> 06:26.927
It wouldn't be
more than a few miles out of our way.

06:27.763 --> 06:29.805
What do you say to that?

06:31.767 --> 06:33.142
Not much, huh?

06:33.226 --> 06:37.605
Your old dad's never crossed the state lines,
but he's been up to Manchester, hasn't he?

06:37.689 --> 06:40.274
He's seen the inside
of the Kentucky State Prison.

06:40.358 --> 06:45.279
You got an uncle who came out of there,
and another did his time in McCreary.

06:45.655 --> 06:48.157
I think we'll skip
seeing any of your kin this trip.

06:48.283 --> 06:51.202
- My uncles are both dead.
- By gunshot, huh?

06:51.703 --> 06:53.829
You understand how I see your people?

07:14.351 --> 07:16.519
Put one on your left wrist.

07:20.190 --> 07:22.274
Now snap the other one to the wheel.

07:22.359 --> 07:24.568
To the wheel, Chinatown. Let's go.

07:25.195 --> 07:27.863
I can't drive
handcuffed to the damn steering wheel.

07:28.490 --> 07:30.574
You'll get the hang of it.

07:34.246 --> 07:35.663
Now drive.

08:15.579 --> 08:17.830
You gonna report what I did?

08:18.415 --> 08:21.625
I don't take what you did personally,
you understand?

08:21.751 --> 08:26.338
Want to lean on you. Or wish you get
any more time than you deserve.

08:26.423 --> 08:30.509
But what you'll have to do now
is ride the rap, as they say.

08:32.304 --> 08:34.471
It's all anybody has to do.

08:51.781 --> 08:54.158
Let's go. Come on down, fellas.

08:58.121 --> 08:59.788
All right. Next.

09:03.043 --> 09:05.920
Where the hell did they get
these stupid costumes, anyway?

09:06.004 --> 09:07.171
Shit.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.966
Well, this is an embarrassment.

09:12.135 --> 09:16.639
Piss and moan all you please, Cooper.
This is what they want to see.

09:16.723 --> 09:19.850
"Hey, Martha, look.
They're making fun of themselves."

09:19.976 --> 09:23.854
They eat that shit up.
All a part of what sells the CDs.

09:24.522 --> 09:27.149
Of which we don't get one red cent.

09:27.692 --> 09:30.736
Now, you want out, buddy,
you just say the word.

09:30.820 --> 09:35.991
We'll be out here, playing parties,
eating good food, looking at pretty women.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.661
You can be back at the tiers,

09:38.745 --> 09:41.872
making yourself another chess set
out of cardboard, huh, Henry?

09:41.998 --> 09:43.457
I heard that.

09:43.541 --> 09:48.003
And if they wanted suit and ties,
we'd be wearing suit and ties.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.882
All right. Let's head on out.

10:42.767 --> 10:44.268
Free Bird!

10:46.021 --> 10:49.023
Hell, these horses live better
than most people I know.

10:49.399 --> 10:51.108
Hey, Price, you're not eating?

10:51.943 --> 10:54.111
No, Henry. You have at it.

10:57.949 --> 11:00.617
Hey, Henry, I got to take a leak.

11:01.953 --> 11:05.080
Coop's already in the Porta-Potty. Use a tree.

11:05.498 --> 11:08.542
Hell, Henry, now, that ain't civilized.

11:11.921 --> 11:16.342
You're back on. We're gonna
start with the cake and Happy Birthday.

11:19.220 --> 11:21.430
Price, let's go. We got to get back out there.

11:21.514 --> 11:24.183
Come on, Henry. I really got to drain it.

11:24.267 --> 11:26.435
Come on, Cooper! Let's go!

11:27.020 --> 11:29.938
- Hey, Henry. What do you want to do?
- You walk them out.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.648
- I'll bring these two.
- All right.

11:31.900 --> 11:35.361
Come on, Coop.
They want to do Happy Birthday now.

11:35.737 --> 11:36.904
Coop!

11:37.906 --> 11:39.615
Stand over there.

11:41.826 --> 11:43.577
Coop, open this door.

11:43.661 --> 11:46.580
- Open this door! Come on, Coop!
- Hey, Henry,

11:46.873 --> 11:48.332
watch this.

11:57.634 --> 11:59.718
- Hello, Art.
- Where are you?

11:59.803 --> 12:01.929
- Just heading back.
- How far are you from the prison?

12:02.013 --> 12:04.640
Not far. Just passed through Parisville.

12:04.724 --> 12:07.935
Well, I want you to go back.
They had a breakout.

12:08.019 --> 12:10.896
- No shit.
- There was a bluegrass convict band

12:10.980 --> 12:12.815
that was playing a birthday
up near Parisville,

12:12.899 --> 12:16.276
and the bass player and the drummer
decided to make a run for it,

12:16.361 --> 12:18.904
so I need you to go back up
to Big Sandy and,

12:18.988 --> 12:20.864
you know, check their cells,
see what you can find.

12:20.949 --> 12:24.243
I sent a couple of deputies up to Parisville.
And get this,

12:24.327 --> 12:28.789
the bass player was about to be released
in 3 months after a 15-year stretch.

12:29.207 --> 12:30.416
You got some names?

12:30.500 --> 12:32.960
They couldn't have gotten very far.
See what you can find out.

12:57.569 --> 12:59.403
- Evening.
- Evening.

13:00.113 --> 13:01.321
You...

13:03.074 --> 13:04.616
You need help with something?

13:04.701 --> 13:07.244
No, I'm just looking for some road food.

13:19.716 --> 13:21.842
There's no way in hell
you're gonna be able to draw and fire

13:21.926 --> 13:23.469
before your head comes off.

13:24.304 --> 13:26.722
- I could get him.
- Fine with me.

13:26.806 --> 13:28.724
- What?
- Set your weapon down on the ground,

13:28.808 --> 13:30.434
please, sir.

13:34.731 --> 13:36.398
And your backup.

13:44.616 --> 13:46.617
Kick them back this way.

13:52.457 --> 13:55.000
On your belly. Hands on your neck.

14:01.925 --> 14:05.552
See, I told you.
Turn the light on, we'll get us a car.

14:06.095 --> 14:08.722
- Got us some more guns, too. Give me one.
- Oh, no.

14:09.891 --> 14:11.558
- You're gonna run.
- What?

14:11.643 --> 14:15.187
As far and as fast as you can,
'cause I swear to you,

14:15.271 --> 14:16.522
if I ever see you again, I'll kill you.

14:16.606 --> 14:18.065
But we just busted out
of the damn joint together.

14:18.149 --> 14:19.483
You got five seconds.

14:19.567 --> 14:20.609
What is this, a joke?

14:22.946 --> 14:24.112
Shit!

14:35.458 --> 14:37.417
All right. You can sit up.

14:37.502 --> 14:39.461
Wallet, ID, keys, hand them over.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.964
- What are you, state police?
- US Marshal.

14:42.048 --> 14:44.299
Marshal? Like in Gunsmoke?

14:45.468 --> 14:47.469
More like The Fugitive.

14:48.388 --> 14:51.223
"Deputy US Marshal Raylan...

14:51.307 --> 14:52.349
"Givens."

14:52.559 --> 14:56.353
I knew a fella up in Manchester
named Givens, Arlo Givens.

14:56.938 --> 14:58.438
Any relation?

14:59.023 --> 15:02.150
I suppose there's still some. He's my father.

15:02.694 --> 15:05.696
No shit.
And here you've become a US Marshal.

15:06.197 --> 15:09.116
- How'd that go down with him?
- I wouldn't know.

15:09.200 --> 15:12.578
Now take your handcuffs out
and cuff your hands behind your back.

15:12.662 --> 15:14.371
So, you Cooper or Price?

15:16.082 --> 15:17.207
I'm one of them.

15:18.585 --> 15:22.421
Fine. I'll wait and find out tomorrow
when your picture's in the paper.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.967
My name is Douglas Cooper.
Glad to meet you.

15:27.051 --> 15:30.053
- You didn't care so much for Price, huh?
- Get on your feet.

15:30.513 --> 15:32.055
What was he in for?

15:32.140 --> 15:35.100
His real crime? Being a lousy drummer.

15:35.727 --> 15:39.021
He's not incompetent. The man could
play a paradiddle, but he's showy,

15:39.105 --> 15:40.397
has no sense of time.

15:40.481 --> 15:43.066
How can you tell
there's a bad drummer at your door?

15:43.151 --> 15:45.277
- I don't know. How?
- The knock speeds up.

15:45.361 --> 15:47.237
Nice. You a musician?

15:47.447 --> 15:49.615
No, just someone who likes music.

15:49.699 --> 15:52.659
Yeah, and shitty jokes. Come on. Let's go.

15:53.369 --> 15:58.040
- And what were you in for, Mr. Cooper?
- I expect you know that already.

15:58.124 --> 16:01.126
Fifteen years is a long time for one bank job.

16:01.210 --> 16:04.338
Well, the thing is,
a fella died as a direct result.

16:04.422 --> 16:06.256
Foreseeable circumstances.

16:06.591 --> 16:10.802
But, honestly, if you hire a moron
for a driver, it's foreseeable.

16:10.887 --> 16:14.348
You taking my badge and my car
to get past any roadblocks, huh?

16:16.351 --> 16:19.019
And your hat. Good night, deputy.

16:20.438 --> 16:22.439
Good night, Mr. Cooper.

16:28.738 --> 16:31.031
Well... Shit.

16:40.166 --> 16:41.875
Come in. Come in.

16:42.919 --> 16:46.088
Now, let me get this straight.
He took your gun...

16:46.839 --> 16:48.548
Sorry, two guns.

16:48.633 --> 16:51.968
Your badge, your car, and your hat.

16:53.304 --> 16:56.139
- He take anything else?
- Not that I can remember.

16:56.307 --> 16:58.350
He didn't rape you, did he?

16:58.434 --> 17:00.310
We found your car at the airport,

17:00.478 --> 17:04.690
which means that Cooper either left town
or he wants us to think that he left town.

17:04.773 --> 17:07.943
We found this in the trunk.
That look familiar?

17:11.446 --> 17:14.116
- You didn't find any guns, did you?
- No. Sorry.

17:14.242 --> 17:17.618
The dogs chased Price into a culvert,
and then Rachel talked to him.

17:17.869 --> 17:19.788
She and Tim can bring you up to speed.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.248
All right.

17:22.959 --> 17:26.127
Raylan, just a second. Shut that door.

17:28.589 --> 17:32.384
I got a call this morning from
AUSA David Vasquez.

17:32.468 --> 17:35.053
Wants to talk to you
about your shooting Boyd Crowder.

17:35.388 --> 17:39.224
Well, what's there to talk about?
He pulled first. There was a witness.

17:39.308 --> 17:42.978
But, you see, 10 days ago,
you shot a man in Miami.

17:43.104 --> 17:47.649
Put it like this. If you was in the first grade
and you bit somebody every week,

17:47.775 --> 17:50.736
they'd start to think of you as a biter.

17:50.820 --> 17:54.656
He also wants Ava to come up to Lexington
to talk about it.

17:54.991 --> 17:56.992
- Well, fine with me.
- Which part?

17:57.118 --> 17:58.744
The part about her talking to Vasquez

17:58.828 --> 18:01.580
or the part about her
coming up to Lexington?

18:01.664 --> 18:04.666
- Raylan, you can't sleep with her.
- I know.

18:04.751 --> 18:06.460
- Raylan...
- I won't.

18:09.505 --> 18:12.007
You starting to regret me coming here?

18:12.091 --> 18:13.341
Not yet.

18:15.678 --> 18:18.096
Price says the only reason why he helped
Cooper escape

18:18.181 --> 18:20.348
is because Cooper promised him
a lot of money.

18:20.433 --> 18:23.268
Which could be from his last job.
He got away with $180,000.

18:23.352 --> 18:25.020
Never recovered.

18:25.146 --> 18:27.272
Tell me about the dead driver.

18:27.356 --> 18:30.776
He was a Mensa candidate
named Drew Baxter.

18:30.860 --> 18:33.695
A few hours after the robbery,
Cooper and Baxter headed out of town.

18:33.780 --> 18:37.365
Baxter's driving.
They get pulled over for a traffic violation.

18:37.658 --> 18:39.826
Baxter decides to floor it.

18:40.161 --> 18:43.789
Hilarious hijinks ensue.
Baxter drives head-on into a tree,

18:43.873 --> 18:47.375
goes through the windshield,
and into the afterlife.

18:47.502 --> 18:50.796
And it all fell under commission,
so Cooper got charged with his murder.

18:50.880 --> 18:53.965
So, why is he breaking out
with only three months left on his bit?

18:54.050 --> 18:56.051
I mean, has he got
a daughter getting married

18:56.135 --> 18:58.220
or a granddaughter graduating school?

18:58.346 --> 19:01.014
No kids, and his mother and father passed.

19:01.182 --> 19:03.475
He was married when he went inside.

19:03.559 --> 19:06.812
Younger woman, one-time exotic dancer,
named Shirley Kelso.

19:06.896 --> 19:09.815
Didn't divorce until five years ago.
Still lives in town.

19:09.899 --> 19:11.316
I thought I'd go have a word.

19:11.400 --> 19:13.735
I'm gonna take a team
and check acquaintances.

19:14.153 --> 19:16.738
I'm gonna go with him.
Nothing against acquaintances,

19:16.823 --> 19:19.866
but one-time-exotic-dancer Shirley
sounds a little more fun.

19:30.044 --> 19:31.753
What the hell did you say to him?

19:32.004 --> 19:34.548
I'll catch up with you at the car.

19:39.095 --> 19:41.680
- Hello, Winona.
- What did you say to Gary?

19:41.848 --> 19:44.766
I believe I said, "Hi, Gary."

19:45.101 --> 19:47.936
- Why? Why did he say I said?
- He didn't. Just he didn't sleep

19:48.020 --> 19:50.188
the rest of that night,
and the next morning, he was still shaking.

19:50.273 --> 19:52.190
And every night since then,
he checks the windows,

19:52.275 --> 19:55.193
and he checks the doors,
and then he checks them again.

19:55.278 --> 19:58.613
I don't know.
Winona, does Gary spook easy?

20:01.284 --> 20:03.535
What are you implying?
You wouldn't be startled

20:03.619 --> 20:05.453
if somebody broke into your home
in the middle of the night?

20:05.580 --> 20:07.247
I'm not implying anything.

20:18.801 --> 20:20.719
I heard you got jumped by an old convict.

20:20.803 --> 20:22.637
Does 55 still seem old to you?

20:22.763 --> 20:24.973
Are you gonna shoot him if you catch him?

20:25.474 --> 20:27.642
All right, look,
I won't show up unannounced anymore.

20:27.810 --> 20:30.312
You won't show up at all anymore.

20:37.820 --> 20:41.156
Art tells me
you were a sniper with the Rangers.

20:42.325 --> 20:43.783
Yeah, I was.

20:45.036 --> 20:47.454
What's the longest
you ever had to watch a target?

20:47.538 --> 20:48.997
Three days.

20:50.875 --> 20:53.668
Shitty little village outside Kandahar.

20:54.545 --> 20:55.629
You watch a man that long,

20:55.713 --> 20:58.548
you can get to know him
better than his wife does.

20:58.674 --> 21:01.468
How he reads the paper, picks his nose,

21:02.136 --> 21:05.388
what glass he likes for tea,
what one for milk...

21:06.682 --> 21:11.019
If he jerks off,
what he looks at when he does.

21:12.855 --> 21:15.857
If he's nice to the dog
when no one's around.

21:15.983 --> 21:18.360
What's the trick to something like that?

21:18.819 --> 21:20.862
Keeping your focus?

21:20.988 --> 21:24.407
Well, they told us to come up with stories
about ourselves and the target.

21:24.533 --> 21:27.035
- What do you mean, "stories"?
- Well, nothing elaborate.

21:27.161 --> 21:29.871
Imagine taking Shirley to the movies,

21:30.748 --> 21:34.042
watching Price is Right,
eating takeout Chinese.

21:34.710 --> 21:37.879
They eventually stopped that,
the business with the stories.

21:38.005 --> 21:39.422
Why is that?

21:40.091 --> 21:44.803
They found some folks get so involved
in the tales they're telling themselves,

21:44.887 --> 21:46.763
they grow to like the target.

21:47.515 --> 21:50.433
And when they got the green light,
they couldn't pull.

21:55.564 --> 21:57.565
That ever happen to you?

21:58.025 --> 22:00.235
- Is that her?
- Looks like it.

22:06.909 --> 22:08.076
US Marshals.

22:10.871 --> 22:12.414
Shirley Kelso?

22:12.540 --> 22:15.917
You think he's here?
You're welcome to look around.

22:24.927 --> 22:26.386
Who's this?

22:26.470 --> 22:29.681
They're with the Marshals.
I'm guessing they're looking for my ex.

22:29.765 --> 22:34.519
My cousin Dupree. He's staying with me
till he gets on his feet in construction.

22:34.603 --> 22:37.397
- Y'all want a beer or something?
- Yeah, love one.

22:37.773 --> 22:40.150
- Pabst, Schlitz, Mickey's...
- It was a joke.

22:40.276 --> 22:43.361
- We can't have a beer.
- Well, I don't want your job, then, do I?

22:43.446 --> 22:45.572
Either of you seen or heard
from Douglas Cooper?

22:45.656 --> 22:47.866
You mean since he broke out or since ever?

22:47.950 --> 22:49.159
Since last night.

22:49.410 --> 22:53.121
No, and I swear to you, you give me a card
or a number and he turns up,

22:53.247 --> 22:55.457
you'll be the first person I call.

22:55.583 --> 22:57.876
Marrying him was
the biggest mistake of my life.

22:57.960 --> 23:00.336
You stayed married to him
till five years ago.

23:01.130 --> 23:03.006
There were tax advantages.

23:03.799 --> 23:07.635
Any idea why he'd bust out
with just a few months left on his bit?

23:07.762 --> 23:09.929
None at all.
I mean, you ask me, he's long gone.

23:10.014 --> 23:11.890
I mean, there is nothing for him here.

23:11.974 --> 23:13.933
When's the last time you saw him?

23:14.018 --> 23:16.144
Before the divorce, yeah.

23:18.939 --> 23:20.190
What do you think?

23:20.316 --> 23:22.692
Sure made a big deal
about running down her ex-husband.

23:22.818 --> 23:25.862
Of course, that might have been
for Dupree's benefit.

23:25.988 --> 23:27.739
You don't think they're cousins?

23:27.823 --> 23:31.117
Maybe, maybe not.
Either way, she's banging him.

23:31.827 --> 23:33.328
That's got to suck.

23:33.454 --> 23:37.373
To break out of prison,
expecting a blissful marital reunion.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.126
I got to think, no matter
how long you've been divorced,

23:40.211 --> 23:42.921
seeing your old lady
shack up with someone else

23:43.005 --> 23:45.632
is gonna annoy the shit out of you.

23:52.640 --> 23:53.723
If Cooper does show up,

23:53.849 --> 23:56.392
you sure as hell won't
call the number on that Marshal's card.

23:56.519 --> 23:57.644
Oh, yeah?

23:57.728 --> 24:00.146
Well, Coop might not be
so happy to see us, you know?

24:00.231 --> 24:04.651
Who gives a shit? He's the only one
who knows which house to go into.

24:05.069 --> 24:06.861
It doesn't matter. I hope he shows up.

24:09.240 --> 24:11.407
I'm glad you feel that way.

24:11.867 --> 24:14.369
Sit down. Take a seat right there.

24:20.876 --> 24:22.377
How'd you pick the houses?

24:23.587 --> 24:27.048
I saw reports on the TV in prison
about somebody

24:27.174 --> 24:29.968
breaking into houses in Riverbrook,
tearing up the floors.

24:30.052 --> 24:31.344
Now, I know you haven't
found the money yet.

24:31.428 --> 24:34.180
I knew that the minute I saw this shit hole.

24:34.265 --> 24:35.932
How did you pick the houses?

24:37.685 --> 24:42.355
You told me you hid the money in a house
under construction in a development,

24:42.439 --> 24:44.399
and I just figured out
it had to be Riverbrook.

24:44.525 --> 24:45.817
Picked the houses at random?

24:45.901 --> 24:48.736
Well, you always said
your lucky number was 3-2-3,

24:48.863 --> 24:52.073
so we went for houses
with 3-2-3 in the address.

24:54.243 --> 24:55.368
Y'all sleeping together?

24:55.452 --> 24:56.703
We're cousins!

24:57.079 --> 25:01.166
Well, from all the lotions, condoms, and
devices I saw sitting on your nightstand,

25:01.250 --> 25:03.209
it's clear you're sleeping with somebody.

25:03.294 --> 25:05.628
Well, it ain't like
we're first cousins or anything.

25:05.754 --> 25:07.547
There's no need to hide it from him.
He already knows.

25:07.631 --> 25:09.090
There was one device,

25:09.216 --> 25:11.759
kind of a vibrating thing
with ball bearings going all around,

25:11.886 --> 25:13.094
making it wobble all over.

25:13.220 --> 25:14.762
That's Randy Rabbit. It's our best seller.

25:14.889 --> 25:18.016
If I'd known you wanted something like that,
I'd have got it for you back in the day.

25:18.100 --> 25:21.102
I was 22 when you went in.
You were the first man I ever slept with.

25:21.187 --> 25:23.271
I didn't know what I wanted.

25:23.397 --> 25:25.773
Hey, we can all have
a real interesting conversation later

25:25.858 --> 25:28.610
about the merits of various sex toys,
but right now, maybe we ought to

25:28.736 --> 25:31.196
focus on how we're gonna get you out
from under the eyes of that Marshal.

25:31.280 --> 25:33.281
And what's all this "we" shit?

25:33.407 --> 25:35.950
I'm just here to make sure
you hadn't already found the money.

25:36.035 --> 25:39.621
Yeah, but we can help. We got tools.
We got pry bar, a Sawzall.

25:39.705 --> 25:40.705
Fine. I'll take 'em.

25:40.789 --> 25:43.708
How you gonna get out?
You know they got Marshals watching.

25:43.792 --> 25:45.460
I'll wait till after dark, and I'll sneak out back.

25:45.586 --> 25:47.712
You're gonna walk to Riverbrook?
I got a car.

25:47.796 --> 25:48.880
I'll steal one.

25:48.964 --> 25:52.884
You know, you just leave us, what's gonna
stop us from just calling the Marshal?

25:52.968 --> 25:55.386
Good point. Maybe I'll just kill you.

25:58.098 --> 26:00.058
I'm not gonna kill you.

26:00.142 --> 26:02.227
And you aren't gonna call that Marshal

26:02.311 --> 26:04.395
and get sent away
for all them burglaries you've done.

26:04.480 --> 26:06.814
- You know how to bypass burglar alarms?
- I do.

26:06.899 --> 26:09.817
Burglar alarms that have come along
in the last 15 years?

26:09.902 --> 26:14.072
Fiber optics, net-based?
I was an alarm installer before.

26:14.156 --> 26:17.408
How do you think we got in and out
of all those houses without getting caught?

26:17.493 --> 26:19.744
All right. You're in.

26:19.828 --> 26:21.329
- All right.
- 10%.

26:22.164 --> 26:24.832
- Shirley, too. We're a team.
- Fine.

26:24.959 --> 26:26.668
But you share the 10%.

26:28.337 --> 26:30.755
Now, why don't you run out
on the porch and sit down for a spell

26:30.839 --> 26:32.924
and keep an eye on that Marshal.

26:34.176 --> 26:35.677
Cousin Dupree?

26:37.638 --> 26:39.430
Yeah, I'll do that.

26:49.650 --> 26:51.693
I know you must be angry,

26:51.777 --> 26:56.531
but I swear I kept my knees together
for 10 years after you went in.

26:56.615 --> 26:58.616
Finally, I realized I had to live.

26:58.701 --> 27:00.702
Baby, I understand that.

27:01.537 --> 27:04.539
Frankly, I'm surprised
you hadn't gone after my money before now.

27:04.623 --> 27:07.667
Well, we only went after it now
'cause we had to.

27:08.168 --> 27:09.294
Folks in Riverbrook,

27:09.378 --> 27:12.547
they've been remodeling instead of selling
'cause of the downturn,

27:12.673 --> 27:15.967
and we just didn't want
someone to stumble on it. That's all.

27:16.051 --> 27:18.469
- That was the reason, huh?
- Yeah.

27:18.971 --> 27:22.307
Nothing to do with me getting out
in three months.

27:24.727 --> 27:26.811
I told Dupree about it a couple months ago,

27:26.895 --> 27:30.815
and he knows alarms and all,
and he just thought we should try it.

27:30.899 --> 27:33.985
You know, Dupree has ambitions, plans.

27:34.570 --> 27:38.072
- For what, a chain of dildo stores?
- Not just dildos.

27:53.422 --> 27:54.589
Ava.

27:55.591 --> 27:58.009
I told the manager I was your girlfriend.

27:58.093 --> 28:00.762
I'm not being presumptuous
and saying that I am.

28:00.888 --> 28:03.014
I just wanted to surprise you.

28:03.098 --> 28:04.599
And you did.

28:10.439 --> 28:12.690
I can't sleep with you, Ava.

28:14.777 --> 28:17.362
Now look who's being presumptuous.

28:19.114 --> 28:22.617
I know about the assistant attorney
who wants to talk to you.

28:22.701 --> 28:27.455
I can't be getting amorous with a witness
in a shooting I was involved in.

28:28.624 --> 28:31.751
- Couldn't we just make out a little?
- No.

28:34.380 --> 28:37.298
You want me to drive back to Harlan?

28:37.383 --> 28:41.469
You can stay.
I could always sleep on the floor.

28:42.971 --> 28:45.973
Well, it's your bed. I'll take the floor.

28:48.811 --> 28:51.813
Can we just put on a little music and dance?

28:53.649 --> 28:57.068
Do you know why the Pentecostals
don't have sex standing up?

28:57.152 --> 28:59.237
It could lead to dancing.

29:01.824 --> 29:03.825
People talk about cars having
a new-car smell.

29:03.909 --> 29:07.662
This car has an
"old car somebody died in" smell.

29:09.456 --> 29:13.167
- You had a car somebody died in.
- You mean Baxter?

29:14.086 --> 29:17.672
Technically, he died outside the car,
when he hit the tree.

29:17.798 --> 29:21.926
No, I'm not talking about Baxter.
I'm talking about the red car.

29:23.137 --> 29:26.806
My Lord. That '71 Valiant.
I called it the Rocket.

29:27.182 --> 29:29.100
The Rocket. That's right.

29:29.685 --> 29:32.854
He told me he got it cheap
'cause the old guy who owned it died in it

29:32.980 --> 29:35.273
and no one wants to buy a dead man's car.

29:35.357 --> 29:38.192
And I kept joking maybe it was haunted.

29:38.277 --> 29:39.944
And then we went for a drive in the country,

29:40.028 --> 29:43.281
you know, windows down,
breathing in the night air.

29:43.365 --> 29:47.702
And all of a sudden
I hear this moaning sound, this...

29:50.164 --> 29:52.165
You know, like a ghost.

29:52.249 --> 29:54.709
And I about shit a brick.

29:55.294 --> 29:57.795
And this one can't stop laughing.

29:58.297 --> 30:00.173
And then he shows me
a tape recorder under the seat

30:00.257 --> 30:01.841
playing him sounding like a ghost.

30:01.925 --> 30:02.967
Can you believe that?

30:03.051 --> 30:04.886
Y'all want to keep jawing
about the old days,

30:04.970 --> 30:08.723
or y'all want stay on the money train?
What address are you looking for?

30:09.099 --> 30:10.391
I'm not.

30:11.435 --> 30:14.270
When I stashed the money,
these houses were still being built.

30:14.354 --> 30:16.272
They didn't have addresses.

30:16.356 --> 30:17.815
Then what are you looking for?

30:17.900 --> 30:21.527
You were onto something
with my lucky number, 3-2-3.

30:21.612 --> 30:23.863
But it's not in the address.

30:25.240 --> 30:26.532
Are you gonna tell us or not?

30:26.617 --> 30:30.119
All right. The first thing they built out here
was that school we passed back yonder.

30:30.204 --> 30:31.954
Now, that was my starting point.

30:32.039 --> 30:36.250
I took the third right and the second left,
and the third house on the right,

30:36.710 --> 30:38.920
3-2-3. Which puts it

30:40.088 --> 30:41.506
right here.

31:00.984 --> 31:04.529
No burglar alarm.
Apparently, I didn't need your help after all.

31:04.613 --> 31:07.406
About as much as we needed
your car-stealing skills.

31:07.491 --> 31:08.991
Well, I stole one.

31:09.076 --> 31:12.370
Could have rented one faster,
and it wouldn't have smelled like a grave.

31:12.454 --> 31:15.998
- Keep it up, and your 10% is gonna be 5%.
- Whatever you say, old man.

31:16.083 --> 31:18.501
You guys want to argue,
or you want to find some money?

31:26.426 --> 31:28.344
Come on, Martha Stewart. Just drop that.

31:28.428 --> 31:31.055
- Here we go. Right here.
- I'm coming.

32:38.457 --> 32:40.499
Maybe you counted wrong.

32:42.169 --> 32:43.878
I counted right.

32:43.962 --> 32:46.464
Maybe you counted wrong 15 years ago.

32:46.548 --> 32:50.217
I didn't count wrong, not then, not now.

32:50.636 --> 32:54.972
The only possibilities are some other folks
found the money and are long gone

32:55.057 --> 32:57.933
or that school got up and moved somehow.

32:58.018 --> 33:00.895
- Now, which do you think is more likely?
- Let me get this straight.

33:00.979 --> 33:02.480
After all this time,

33:02.564 --> 33:04.857
you don't have any idea
where that money is?

33:07.069 --> 33:09.445
- No, I guess I don't.
- Well,

33:09.529 --> 33:11.864
I guess we don't really need you then,
after all, do we?

33:28.298 --> 33:30.049
Come on. Let's go.

33:31.134 --> 33:35.596
I'm sorry. You were gone so long,
I just couldn't wait.

33:36.807 --> 33:38.182
I'm sorry.

33:42.104 --> 33:43.938
You look good, Coop.

33:45.440 --> 33:48.025
Come on! We've got some shit to do.

33:49.444 --> 33:52.738
- Do you know where the money is?
- Well, I do now.

33:54.241 --> 33:56.075
Where are you going?

33:56.868 --> 33:58.953
I ain't getting in that shit heap again.

33:59.037 --> 34:01.372
We get the money,
we'll take ourselves another car.

34:01.456 --> 34:04.333
Ain't nobody gonna stop us. Now, come on.

34:37.826 --> 34:41.120
- Raylan?
- I think I know where Cooper's money is.

34:44.416 --> 34:45.791
Come on, baby.

34:45.876 --> 34:49.795
We're gonna get that money,
I'm gonna buy you anything you want.

34:52.757 --> 34:54.091
Shit.

35:00.223 --> 35:02.641
Got to ask. Why the hat?

35:03.935 --> 35:05.227
Honestly,

35:05.312 --> 35:07.229
I tried it on one time, and it fit.

35:08.190 --> 35:09.398
Oh, shit!

35:21.870 --> 35:26.665
You don't do exactly as I say, you're gonna
get two in the chest and one in the head!

35:28.168 --> 35:30.085
You boosted a Gremlin?

35:30.754 --> 35:34.465
Oh, hell, with all the alarms and stuff
they got on cars these days,

35:34.549 --> 35:38.093
that's all I could get.
I tried to get a Mustang.

35:38.178 --> 35:41.263
So, what happened?
They take the money and run?

35:41.348 --> 35:43.224
No. There wasn't any.

35:44.518 --> 35:46.268
Well, why'd they shoot you?

35:46.353 --> 35:48.896
I don't know. I don't care.

35:51.441 --> 35:55.694
I thought I broke out 'cause of the money,
but then I saw Shirley.

35:59.032 --> 36:02.201
Well, maybe Dupree figured out
where the money is.

36:02.285 --> 36:04.912
Well, I don't see how. I told him

36:04.996 --> 36:07.957
either the money was here
and somebody found it and took off

36:08.041 --> 36:09.750
or that school up and moved.

36:10.794 --> 36:13.796
Yeah, I knew where the money was
in relation to the school.

36:14.756 --> 36:15.923
Which one?

36:16.925 --> 36:18.551
We passed two driving around.

36:21.179 --> 36:22.513
Oh, shit.

36:23.807 --> 36:25.808
Fifteen years is a long time.

36:28.436 --> 36:30.062
I told you we shouldn't have
taken the money.

36:30.146 --> 36:32.439
- You enjoyed it just as much as I did.
- Shut up!

36:32.524 --> 36:34.441
- How'd you find it?
- Well,

36:34.526 --> 36:38.112
Mr. "I'm too cheap to hire a plumber"
tried to put in a new dishwasher

36:38.572 --> 36:42.032
and flooded the entire place,
and then we had to replace the floor.

36:42.117 --> 36:43.576
Oh, yeah, I'm an idiot.

36:43.660 --> 36:45.661
But if it wasn't for me,
we never would have found the money.

36:45.745 --> 36:47.580
And we wouldn't be sitting here now!

36:47.664 --> 36:49.915
Where was all your second-guessing
when you got your new boobs?

36:50.000 --> 36:51.917
You enjoyed them a hell of a lot more
than I ever did!

36:52.002 --> 36:53.085
They're very nice.

36:53.169 --> 36:54.962
- Thank you.
- Shut up!

36:57.007 --> 37:01.343
Now, I want what's left of the money
right now, or I start shooting.

37:03.096 --> 37:05.306
- There is none.
- I'll start with you.

37:05.473 --> 37:07.224
No! No! He's telling the truth.

37:07.309 --> 37:11.896
After the boat and the car and my boobs
and the TVs, it's all gone.

37:13.523 --> 37:14.940
Man.

37:19.654 --> 37:21.280
He's got them tied to chairs.

37:21.364 --> 37:24.325
We take the back.
Rachel and Raylan, you take the front.

37:24.409 --> 37:27.745
- You got a story for Cousin Dupree?
- Yeah. But it's pretty simple.

37:27.829 --> 37:31.290
If he does anything out of line,
I get to shoot him.

37:31.625 --> 37:33.459
That's a good story.

37:39.341 --> 37:42.217
- How much those shoes run you?
- Seven hundred.

37:43.178 --> 37:45.554
$700 for a pair of shoes?

37:46.056 --> 37:47.598
They're alligator.

37:51.227 --> 37:53.896
Got your alligator's attention?

37:54.105 --> 37:57.942
We'll get you every last cent we have!
Just please don't shoot anymore!

37:59.152 --> 38:00.361
My foot!

38:00.445 --> 38:03.781
Shirley, untie the woman.
She might could take us to the bank.

38:03.865 --> 38:05.074
Okay.

38:05.158 --> 38:07.034
No. Shit. Stop.

38:08.536 --> 38:11.914
The banks ain't open this hour. Shit!

38:12.624 --> 38:13.874
Let me think.

38:14.292 --> 38:15.834
US Marshals.

38:15.919 --> 38:17.878
I was wondering if I could come inside.

38:17.963 --> 38:19.588
No, you can't come inside!

38:19.673 --> 38:22.967
Dupree, this isn't your home. Mr. Lonner,

38:23.927 --> 38:25.135
may I come inside?

38:25.220 --> 38:27.054
God, yes! Come inside!

38:27.138 --> 38:28.472
Hey, you ain't calling the shots here.

38:28.556 --> 38:31.141
Just coming inside to explain things to you.

38:31.977 --> 38:34.812
- There ain't nothing to explain.
- Ten seconds. Huh?

38:34.896 --> 38:37.690
Dupree, can you just keep your gun down
for 10 seconds?

38:37.774 --> 38:40.192
I can tell you both what's what.

38:42.320 --> 38:43.570
You can see my hands.

38:46.533 --> 38:47.908
All right?

38:49.160 --> 38:51.412
- All right.
- All right.

38:52.038 --> 38:54.415
You mind standing where I can see you?

38:57.711 --> 39:00.004
Now I'm gonna give you a choice.

39:00.088 --> 39:02.965
You won't like it, but it's real simple.

39:03.717 --> 39:06.927
If you raise your gun again, you're dead.

39:07.971 --> 39:10.556
Aim at the family, you're dead.

39:10.640 --> 39:14.226
If you move too fast
from where you're standing, dead.

39:14.811 --> 39:18.105
In fact, I'd say dropping your weapons
and putting your hands behind your head's

39:18.189 --> 39:21.358
the only viable option,
but that's your choice.

39:27.198 --> 39:30.534
- Well, we got guns and hostages here.
- I see that.

39:31.786 --> 39:35.330
Do you really think you can draw and fire
before one of us pulls the trigger?

39:35.623 --> 39:39.501
This ain't about me.
This is about Deputy Tim Gutterson,

39:40.170 --> 39:42.254
sniper in the Afghan War.

39:43.465 --> 39:45.382
Well, I don't see him.

39:45.967 --> 39:48.093
You got a little sniper in your pocket?

39:48.178 --> 39:50.971
Well, he's out back, across the street there.

39:52.140 --> 39:53.807
He bullshitting?

39:55.685 --> 39:56.852
Well,

39:57.937 --> 40:01.273
I see cars and people. I don't see a sniper.

40:01.357 --> 40:05.069
No, no, no, no.
He's there, or I wouldn't be here.

40:06.154 --> 40:07.905
Where's the light switch for this room?

40:07.989 --> 40:10.449
Now, Dupree, I know
that wasn't on the list, but...

40:10.533 --> 40:12.201
Where's the goddamn light switch?

40:12.327 --> 40:14.495
- On the wall, by your friend.
- Shirley, find that switch.

40:14.579 --> 40:16.580
- Shirley...
- On the count of three, flip the switch.

40:16.664 --> 40:19.708
- Shirley, don't do it.
- One, two, three!

40:39.521 --> 40:41.438
Why'd you turn the light back on?

40:42.190 --> 40:44.775
He had no need to shoot my husband.

40:47.070 --> 40:50.072
Initial here, here, and here.

40:50.907 --> 40:52.574
Going solo again?

40:52.700 --> 40:54.034
Another deputy in the car.

40:54.119 --> 40:56.703
- Learned your lesson?
- Until I forget.

40:57.038 --> 41:00.374
Stand up, walk through.
Put your feet on the feet.

41:03.128 --> 41:04.962
You know the drill.

41:05.922 --> 41:08.757
- How's the gut?
- Well, they tell me my plumbing's okay,

41:09.050 --> 41:11.718
but every which way I move hurts.

41:13.888 --> 41:15.139
I think we're good.

41:16.391 --> 41:18.142
Did you find the money?

41:18.226 --> 41:20.227
The couple in the house found it.

41:21.396 --> 41:22.646
They enjoy it?

41:25.275 --> 41:26.608
They bought a lot of stuff.

41:28.444 --> 41:31.572
- Have you seen Shirley?
- I'm sorry, I haven't.

41:32.240 --> 41:34.241
I know she's in custody.

41:35.410 --> 41:38.871
But she helped you guys nail Dupree, right?
That ought to count for something.

41:38.955 --> 41:41.456
She's still gonna pull some time.

41:44.586 --> 41:47.754
Maybe we'll get out about the same time.

41:47.839 --> 41:50.090
Maybe. Maybe.

41:51.509 --> 41:52.676
Man.

41:54.762 --> 41:56.430
She looked good.
