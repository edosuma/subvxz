02:41.987 --> 02:44.020
- Everything looks so beautiful
from up here.

02:47.762 --> 02:49.729
- I'll say.

02:57.068 --> 02:59.838
- I've been thinking about you
all week.

02:59.873 --> 03:02.709
I can't get you
out of my mind.

03:02.744 --> 03:04.843
- I've been thinking
about you, too.

03:10.455 --> 03:13.082
- God, you're amazing.

03:13.117 --> 03:14.853
You know that?

03:17.462 --> 03:18.923
What's wrong?

03:18.958 --> 03:23.334
- It's just you deserve
more than this.

03:23.369 --> 03:28.504
- This moment right here,
this is all I need.

03:28.539 --> 03:30.869
- Tom.
-

03:34.446 --> 03:38.580
- I'm sorry. I can't.

03:38.615 --> 03:42.078
- It's okay. It's okay.

03:51.331 --> 03:53.991
Emma, you've gotta
talk to me.

04:00.802 --> 04:03.803
- This isn't gonna work.

04:03.838 --> 04:05.970
We can't do this anymore.

04:08.777 --> 04:14.550
- Listen...

04:14.585 --> 04:17.586
I know this is not
how we expected things to go.

04:19.656 --> 04:24.428
But I really care about you.

04:27.532 --> 04:30.929
You can't say you don't feel
the same way about me.

04:33.769 --> 04:35.538
- How I feel doesn't matter.

04:38.642 --> 04:39.839
- Emma.

04:39.874 --> 04:44.173
Emma, wait.
Just meet with me tomorrow.

04:44.208 --> 04:46.813
I don't want this to be
the last time I see you.

04:48.355 --> 04:52.885
- We can't.
- Why?

04:56.726 --> 04:59.496
- Because it's my anniversary.

05:03.403 --> 05:07.900
I'm sorry. It's over.

05:53.343 --> 05:56.751
- Mark Webster's office,
please hold.

05:56.786 --> 05:58.819
Happy anniversary,
Mrs. Webster.

05:58.854 --> 06:01.184
- Oh, they're beautiful.
Thank you.

06:01.219 --> 06:03.923
- Thanks for waiting.
How can I help you?

06:03.958 --> 06:06.365
No, I've already stated
that we have no comment.

06:33.922 --> 06:36.428
- Stop it!

07:00.850 --> 07:02.278
- Thanks, Selena.

07:06.493 --> 07:08.284
Hello, pumpkin.

07:08.319 --> 07:10.352
I thought you were
gonna wear the red dress.

07:13.324 --> 07:15.830
You know that's my favorite.

07:15.865 --> 07:18.228
- I know. I just thought
that maybe we could

07:18.263 --> 07:20.736
try something
a little different.

07:20.771 --> 07:22.606
- It's okay.

07:22.641 --> 07:25.103
There's still time to stop
by the apartment and change.

07:27.712 --> 07:28.942
What's that?

07:28.977 --> 07:30.779
- Nothing.

07:36.622 --> 07:40.118
- Emma, you know that's only
going to trigger your anxiety.

07:41.858 --> 07:45.629
- I'm sorry.

07:45.664 --> 07:47.697
What are you
doing with my file?

07:47.732 --> 07:50.502
- They're revoking his parole.

07:50.537 --> 07:52.933
- Don't you wish you were still
putting guys like that in jail

07:52.968 --> 07:55.034
instead of keeping them out?

07:59.975 --> 08:02.041
- I don't miss living out
of a shoebox in Birmingham

08:02.076 --> 08:03.977
wearing cheap suits,

08:04.012 --> 08:06.518
and I don't miss doing
everyone else's dirty work.

08:08.016 --> 08:10.819
Up here everyone else
does the dirty work for me.

08:14.484 --> 08:16.385
Do you know
what I do miss, though?

08:20.897 --> 08:24.360
I miss that carefree girl.

08:24.395 --> 08:26.032
One of the few photos
I have of you

08:26.067 --> 08:28.903
in front of the camera.

08:28.938 --> 08:30.707
What was she thinking?

08:32.777 --> 08:34.403
- I don't remember.

08:51.598 --> 08:56.425
- Oh, sir.

08:56.460 --> 08:57.426
Pardon me.

08:57.461 --> 08:58.999
- You've met my wife,
haven't you?

09:01.135 --> 09:02.838
I don't think so.

09:02.873 --> 09:06.204
- Emma, this is Tom Gorman.

09:06.239 --> 09:09.372
- We met at the Christmas party
last year, actually.

09:09.407 --> 09:11.616
- That's right. You auctioned
off some of your photographs

09:11.651 --> 09:13.046
you took for charity.

09:13.081 --> 09:15.246
They were stunning.
- No, no.

09:15.281 --> 09:18.084
You both know
it wasn't the Christmas party.

09:21.386 --> 09:23.419
It was the holiday party,

09:23.454 --> 09:25.553
lest we offend the PC police.

09:27.667 --> 09:29.227
Much on for the weekend?

09:29.262 --> 09:31.966
- Just paperwork,
somebody's gotta keep the--

09:43.177 --> 09:44.572
- Emma, darling.

09:44.607 --> 09:47.146
- Yes?

09:47.181 --> 09:51.117
- I drove.
- Right.

09:51.152 --> 09:52.756
- Nice to meet you again.

09:54.584 --> 09:55.858
Monday.

09:58.192 --> 10:02.293
- Now, that was delicious.

10:05.265 --> 10:07.672
- Would you like some dessert?

10:07.707 --> 10:11.005
- I'm fine. Thank you.
- How is the gateau a la creme?

10:11.040 --> 10:13.172
- It's to die for.
- Perfect.

10:13.207 --> 10:14.976
We'll take two.

10:15.011 --> 10:16.538
- Of course.

10:24.053 --> 10:26.185
- I thought we
weren't doing gifts.

10:26.220 --> 10:28.385
- I wanted to surprise
you tonight.

10:33.524 --> 10:36.096
They say diamonds
are a girl's best friend,

10:36.131 --> 10:41.101
but 11 years apparently
makes it our steel anniversary,

10:41.136 --> 10:43.675
so I had this specially made.

10:43.710 --> 10:46.634
- It's beautiful.

10:46.669 --> 10:49.472
Thank you.

10:49.507 --> 10:51.980
- Try it on.
- Oh, my gosh!

10:53.478 --> 10:56.017
- Yay!

11:02.025 --> 11:06.731
- That was you not so long ago.

11:06.766 --> 11:08.733
Hey.

11:08.768 --> 11:10.834
You still with us?

11:10.869 --> 11:11.868
- Yeah.

11:19.108 --> 11:21.207
- I thought we weren't
doing gifts.

11:24.784 --> 11:25.882
Super Bowl?

11:25.917 --> 11:27.884
- Fifty yard line,
you did always say

11:27.919 --> 11:29.314
that you wanted to go,
and I thought

11:29.349 --> 11:33.087
that maybe this year
the Steelers would be in it.

11:33.122 --> 11:35.254
- Not a chance.

11:35.289 --> 11:36.255
They suck this year.

11:36.290 --> 11:38.389
They're, like, 4-12.

11:39.722 --> 11:40.897
Let me.

12:02.712 --> 12:05.383
Happy anniversary, pumpkin.

12:44.864 --> 12:48.162
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

12:51.332 --> 12:53.464
- I know it is none
of my business,

12:53.499 --> 12:56.302
and I know that you feel
like you just made

12:56.337 --> 12:59.404
a huge commitment out there,

12:59.439 --> 13:00.471
but I just want you
to understand

13:00.506 --> 13:02.979
that nothing is set in stone.

13:04.642 --> 13:07.478
- Yeah, you're right.
It's none of your business.

13:07.513 --> 13:11.185
- No, I--
I know, you're right.

13:11.220 --> 13:12.681
I'm sorry.

13:18.359 --> 13:20.623
Congratulations.

13:35.882 --> 13:37.915
Thank you.

14:02.238 --> 14:03.501
- Before we head on home,

14:03.536 --> 14:06.306
there's one
final surprise, babe.

14:06.341 --> 14:08.110
Check your pockets.

14:44.049 --> 14:46.280
- Can you please just tell me
where we're going?

14:46.315 --> 14:49.250
- No.

14:49.285 --> 14:50.878
We're almost there, I promise.

14:50.913 --> 14:51.956
- You've been saying that
for an hour.

14:51.991 --> 14:54.057
- Yeah, but this time
I mean it.

14:54.092 --> 14:57.753
Just try and have some fun,
would you? Come on.

14:57.788 --> 14:59.425
- Being blindfolded
for over an hour

14:59.460 --> 15:01.427
really isn't my idea of fun.

15:01.462 --> 15:03.561
- It was when we first
got married.

15:18.413 --> 15:20.248
- I'm not--I'm not doing this.

15:20.283 --> 15:21.381
I can't do it. I feel carsick.

15:21.416 --> 15:23.383
I'm taking it off. I don't--

15:23.418 --> 15:24.780
- Stop.

15:27.818 --> 15:29.961
You're gonna
ruin the surprise.

15:32.823 --> 15:37.067
- Mark, I really don't know

15:37.102 --> 15:38.464
what kind of weird game
you're playing,

15:38.499 --> 15:41.170
but I don't want
to fool around.

15:54.449 --> 15:58.451
Mark.

15:58.486 --> 16:02.026
Mark.
Mark, where are we going?

16:08.034 --> 16:10.100
The lake house?

16:10.135 --> 16:14.830
- Surprise. I had them
prepare it for us today.

16:16.867 --> 16:19.670
- It's so strange
in the winter.

16:24.314 --> 16:27.216
- We have a lot of
happy memories here.

16:27.251 --> 16:31.583
I thought maybe
we can rekindle some of them.

16:49.867 --> 16:53.572
- 75, 76,

16:53.607 --> 17:00.480
77, 78, 79--

17:00.515 --> 17:01.943
Fuck it.

17:28.114 --> 17:30.609
- "I love you
with all my heart.

17:30.644 --> 17:31.973
Till death do us part."

19:12.042 --> 19:15.813
-

19:59.188 --> 20:02.761
and heat and ground

20:20.385 --> 20:23.848
- Took you long enough.

20:23.883 --> 20:27.258
You know, it's really not fair.

20:27.293 --> 20:28.523
- What?

20:28.558 --> 20:30.888
- That you just get more
beautiful as you get older.

20:32.826 --> 20:35.794
- Well, I started out
very ugly.

20:37.765 --> 20:38.896
- Mm.

21:05.925 --> 21:11.665
- Emma, I know

21:11.700 --> 21:14.800
that things
have been bad between us,

21:14.835 --> 21:17.770
been bad for a while,

21:17.805 --> 21:20.641
and I'm sorry.

21:20.676 --> 21:22.973
You've been through so much,

21:23.008 --> 21:25.712
and I haven't been
a good husband.

21:27.782 --> 21:30.816
I know one stupid
anniversary surprise

21:30.851 --> 21:34.622
isn't gonna fix everything,

21:34.657 --> 21:36.624
but it's a start.

21:39.288 --> 21:41.530
We owe it that much, don't we?

21:56.481 --> 22:00.142
what man receives

22:04.148 --> 22:08.788
my knees are falling

22:12.827 --> 22:18.369
falling leaves?

23:02.272 --> 23:04.943
- Oh, my God.
It's freezing.

23:06.980 --> 23:09.618
- Morning, sweetheart.

23:09.653 --> 23:11.312
How are you feeling?

23:12.755 --> 23:14.458
- Hungover.

23:16.462 --> 23:19.089
- Mm.

23:19.124 --> 23:21.399
Did you dream
beautiful things?

23:23.832 --> 23:28.769
- Ah--

23:28.804 --> 23:30.771
What the fuck is this?

23:32.841 --> 23:36.546
What is this?

23:36.581 --> 23:40.418
Mark? Mark?

23:44.820 --> 23:47.887
- It's time to wake up.

24:15.950 --> 24:18.522
Oh, shit!

24:20.482 --> 24:23.054
Help!

25:14.008 --> 25:16.008
Please.

25:46.942 --> 25:50.075
Oh.

26:11.736 --> 26:13.296
Oh.

27:49.834 --> 27:51.559
Ah!

27:54.234 --> 27:56.036
Uh!

27:59.668 --> 28:01.437
Oh.

28:28.235 --> 28:30.103
Ow.

29:52.220 --> 29:56.618
Oh, come on. Come on.

29:56.653 --> 30:01.260
Please help me,
please, please.

30:01.295 --> 30:02.723
Yes!

30:04.364 --> 30:07.761
No, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

30:07.796 --> 30:10.137
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no! Fuck!

30:44.503 --> 30:47.669
Keys. Fuck yes!

31:09.693 --> 31:16.236
Oh.

32:34.844 --> 32:37.449
Thought you would be lighter
without all that blood.

32:39.222 --> 32:44.489
Oh. Okay. Oh, come on.

32:44.524 --> 32:46.491
Come on, come on, come on.

32:46.526 --> 32:48.724
Yes!

32:58.340 --> 33:01.638
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

33:01.673 --> 33:04.113
Fuck.

33:06.876 --> 33:10.020
Oh, motherfucker.

33:11.485 --> 33:15.355
Why?
-

33:22.067 --> 33:23.660
- Our wedding tune.
-

33:23.695 --> 33:26.861
- Remember?
-

33:28.997 --> 33:33.571
I have to admit. I'm impressed
you made it this far.

33:33.606 --> 33:35.573
You should have knelt
at my feet

33:35.608 --> 33:38.411
after everything
I did for you.

33:38.446 --> 33:41.007
When I met you,
you were nothing--

33:41.042 --> 33:44.318
a failed photographer
with no money, no hope.

33:44.353 --> 33:46.584
My only regret
is not being there

33:46.619 --> 33:49.917
to see the look
on your face right now.

33:50.854 --> 33:53.393
I don't want to give you
the satisfaction of thinking

33:53.428 --> 33:54.724
I put a bullet in my head

33:54.759 --> 33:57.529
because of your disobedience,

33:57.564 --> 34:00.565
but I was being called away,

34:00.600 --> 34:03.436
and I couldn't just sit back
and watch you live

34:03.471 --> 34:06.505
happily ever after, with him.

34:06.540 --> 34:09.508
Happy anniversary, pumpkin.

34:19.949 --> 34:24.655
some people say

35:14.278 --> 35:16.410
- No.

35:16.445 --> 35:19.248
No, fuck.

35:19.283 --> 35:21.074
Ah.

35:21.109 --> 35:24.110
Ohh!

35:24.145 --> 35:27.289
No!

36:03.426 --> 36:06.328
Okay. Okay.

36:18.705 --> 36:22.575
Fuck.

36:34.787 --> 36:39.592
You can do this.

36:39.627 --> 36:41.123
I can do this.

37:02.045 --> 37:03.484
Ah!

37:09.052 --> 37:13.395
You fucking hypocrite!

37:13.430 --> 37:17.025
How many fucking times
did I wash lipstick and glitter

37:17.060 --> 37:19.236
off of your fucking shirts?

37:44.593 --> 37:48.089
I was dragging around
that lifeless corpse of yours

37:48.124 --> 37:53.798
long before you put a bullet
in that deranged head of yours.

37:53.833 --> 37:57.604
You just didn't know it yet.

38:18.957 --> 38:22.530
Ahh.

38:25.964 --> 38:27.964
- I'm gonna cut myself
free of you,

38:27.999 --> 38:30.230
if it's the last thing I do.

38:45.181 --> 38:47.049
Oh.

38:48.888 --> 38:50.426
Ow.

40:38.096 --> 40:41.229
- It's 11:26 a.m.
July 2nd.

40:41.264 --> 40:43.231
I'm the assistant
district attorney,

40:43.266 --> 40:47.576
and we'll be personally
overseeing your case.

40:47.611 --> 40:50.942
I know you're weak and tired,
but we need you

40:50.977 --> 40:54.308
to tell us everything
about the attack last night.

40:56.345 --> 41:00.919
- He came out of the shadows,
and he--

41:00.954 --> 41:04.659
he ripped the camera
out of my hands.

41:04.694 --> 41:07.530
I made a--a run for it.

41:07.565 --> 41:10.863
I tried to run, and then
that's when I felt, um...

41:12.130 --> 41:14.064
the--the knife.

41:16.068 --> 41:19.465
I-I went to scream for help
but--

41:19.500 --> 41:21.676
- It's okay.

41:21.711 --> 41:26.879
The detective mentioned
you mutilated your attacker.

41:26.914 --> 41:28.782
- My keys--um, I had--

41:28.817 --> 41:30.982
I had my keys
clenched in my fist, and--

41:31.017 --> 41:33.787
-

41:33.822 --> 41:36.053
- That's the last thing
that I remember.

41:36.088 --> 41:39.122
- Hey, you're safe now.
You're safe.

41:39.157 --> 41:41.993
I promise.
We've apprehended--

41:44.063 --> 41:46.327
Fuck!
