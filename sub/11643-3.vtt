00:04.954 --> 00:06.879
The storm, it's done something to us.

00:06.914 --> 00:10.359
Something's happened to me, too. I turned invisible. Look at me!

00:12.159 --> 00:13.719
Time went backwards.

00:13.754 --> 00:15.079
What, you turned back time?

00:15.114 --> 00:17.239
I've got to have sex with you right now.

00:17.274 --> 00:19.159
What is happening to me?

00:19.194 --> 00:20.919
Everyone can do something, except me?

00:23.719 --> 00:26.039
She can't throw me out. She's my mum.

00:26.074 --> 00:27.959
You killed our probation worker!

00:27.994 --> 00:30.199
If there's no body, there's no crime.

00:30.234 --> 00:32.519
I'm pretty sure this breaches the terms of my ASBO.

00:32.554 --> 00:33.999
Someone knows.

00:34.034 --> 00:36.119
They know we killed our probation worker.

01:52.997 --> 01:54.597
Someone knows we killed him.

01:54.632 --> 01:56.197
Do you think it could be Sally?

01:56.232 --> 01:57.397
Who's Sally?

01:57.432 --> 01:58.437
The probation worker.

01:58.472 --> 02:00.397
Ooh! Sally! Why d'you know her name?

02:00.432 --> 02:01.757
She told us.

02:01.792 --> 02:04.157
You're a twat, because Sally

02:04.192 --> 02:07.077
didn't show up till the day after we killed the other worker.

02:07.112 --> 02:08.877
I suppose you know his name, too?

02:08.912 --> 02:10.077
Tony.

02:11.117 --> 02:12.797
Do you love him?

02:12.832 --> 02:15.237
He's right. She wasn't here.

02:15.272 --> 02:19.036
If I'm invisible, I can see if anyone puts anything else in our lockers.

02:19.071 --> 02:20.516
Sounds like a plan.

02:23.316 --> 02:24.836
You all right with that, yeah?

02:24.871 --> 02:26.636
Works for me.

02:26.671 --> 02:28.716
Go on then.

02:28.751 --> 02:30.156
Turn invisible.

02:32.276 --> 02:34.716
I can't do it when everyone's watching me.

02:34.751 --> 02:38.596
So I guess it's like pissing at a urinal if you've got a tiny cock.

02:42.596 --> 02:45.036
Well, that's, er, really impressive.

02:54.636 --> 02:57.836
Hey, you lot! Did you see it?

03:02.196 --> 03:06.116
OK, so, all these clothes have been donated by members of the public

03:06.151 --> 03:08.755
and we need to sort them before we ship them out to Africa.

03:08.790 --> 03:10.235
Just another day in paradise.

03:10.270 --> 03:12.195
Yeah, well, I'm sure the people

03:12.230 --> 03:14.515
receiving them will be grateful for your hard work.

03:14.550 --> 03:16.635
They should be. They're getting a new wardrobe.

03:16.670 --> 03:17.875
You are so wrong.

03:17.910 --> 03:19.995
These are the categories to sort them into.

03:20.030 --> 03:22.875
It's children's clothes, shoes, coats, that kind of thing.

03:22.910 --> 03:25.115
OK, so, if you've got any questions, just ask.

03:27.795 --> 03:31.515
If a bear and a shark had a fight, who would win?

03:35.475 --> 03:38.075
If you've got any relevant questions, just ask.

03:39.195 --> 03:41.115
Oh, and if it's on dry land,

03:41.150 --> 03:42.755
I'd bet on the bear.

04:11.514 --> 04:13.234
Ski wear. Classic.

04:13.269 --> 04:16.834
Try walking ten miles to the well in these.

04:16.869 --> 04:19.314
Hey, hey, hey. Who am I?

04:33.994 --> 04:36.354
C'mon!

04:36.389 --> 04:38.714
OK.

04:38.749 --> 04:41.954
All right, all right - I'll give you a clue. I'm an annoying cunt.

04:41.989 --> 04:43.434
Yeah, we know that.

04:43.469 --> 04:45.034
I'm Bono!

04:48.433 --> 04:49.033
Who's that?

04:49.068 --> 04:50.833
It's the girl I had the fight with.

04:50.868 --> 04:53.593
I've got to do some restorative justice bollocks with her.

04:54.713 --> 04:56.633
Hey, Bono, yeah?

04:56.668 --> 04:57.793
What?

04:59.073 --> 05:00.433
I don't know why I bother.

05:00.468 --> 05:01.513
Jodi's here. Come on.

05:05.353 --> 05:07.473
Suits ya.

05:29.473 --> 05:33.793
So, have you anything you'd like to say to Kelly?

05:33.828 --> 05:35.953
I've got nothin' to say to her.

05:35.988 --> 05:38.992
Kelly - would you like to tell Jodi why you hit her?

05:39.027 --> 05:41.832
Yeah. Cos if you go round saying someone's a slag,

05:41.867 --> 05:43.072
you're gonna get a slap.

05:44.187 --> 05:46.472
Is there something up with your teeth?

05:46.507 --> 05:48.712
OK. How you are you two going to resolve this?

05:48.747 --> 05:52.952

06:09.267 --> 06:10.672
Yeah.

06:10.707 --> 06:12.512
I heard he dumped ya. What's that about?

06:12.547 --> 06:13.752
What is it to you?

06:13.787 --> 06:15.272
Let's keep things friendly.

06:15.307 --> 06:17.192
I think you're better off without him. He's a rat face glue sniffer.

06:17.227 --> 06:18.192
Kelly.

06:18.227 --> 06:19.032
Are you sayin' he's got a rat face?

06:19.067 --> 06:20.392
Yeah, he's proper ratty.

06:20.427 --> 06:22.392
Don't even be talking about him!

06:22.427 --> 06:24.232
What d'you care?
Cos he dumped ya!

06:24.267 --> 06:25.272
Fuckin'...

06:26.512 --> 06:27.671
Kelly!

06:27.706 --> 06:29.071
You see how it feels, bitch!

06:33.631 --> 06:35.151
She's getting life. She head butt me!

06:35.186 --> 06:36.191
Just get out.

06:36.226 --> 06:37.351
You slut whore!

06:37.386 --> 06:38.391
Calm down.

06:38.426 --> 06:40.151
Shut up, you twat!

06:40.186 --> 06:41.391
Kelly!

06:41.426 --> 06:44.071
I was tryin' to be nice!

06:50.151 --> 06:51.791
I think that went pretty well.

07:06.191 --> 07:09.391
How comes you never talk about what happened when you got arrested?

07:09.426 --> 07:10.991
Nothin' to talk about.

07:11.026 --> 07:14.551
See. That just makes me more curious.

07:14.586 --> 07:15.991
C'mon. Give it up!

07:18.110 --> 07:20.030
I was buying some coke.

07:21.870 --> 07:24.270
Me and this girl I was seeing.

07:24.305 --> 07:25.470
Sam.

07:26.710 --> 07:29.030
The police caught us.

07:29.065 --> 07:30.310
That sucks.

07:30.345 --> 07:32.950
I had one wrap on me.

07:32.985 --> 07:35.670
She had the rest of it.

07:35.705 --> 07:38.190
She was done for intent to supply.

07:38.225 --> 07:39.390
What happened?

07:40.550 --> 07:41.510
She went to prison.

07:42.790 --> 07:43.990
Six months.

07:44.025 --> 07:45.430
Shit.

07:48.070 --> 07:49.950
Are you still with her?

07:49.985 --> 07:53.750
Everything that was happening - it was too messy.

07:53.785 --> 07:57.910
So, you're not with anyone?

07:57.945 --> 08:00.150
Nah.

08:03.830 --> 08:05.510
What?

08:07.589 --> 08:08.709
What?

08:08.744 --> 08:09.709
You know what.

08:11.349 --> 08:12.909
I know you want to.

08:14.069 --> 08:16.749
All I have to do is touch you.

08:16.784 --> 08:17.749
Don't.

08:20.469 --> 08:22.189
I could have you

08:23.829 --> 08:26.309
any time I want.

08:26.344 --> 08:28.749
Quit doing that, man. Leave it!

08:28.784 --> 08:30.189
Stop being such a dick.

08:38.828 --> 08:40.109
You're so beautiful.

08:44.269 --> 08:45.589
Curtis, wait!

08:45.624 --> 08:46.989
Curtis!

08:48.749 --> 08:49.829
Curtis!

08:59.428 --> 09:02.428
I'm always thinking of you. I just want to be with you.

09:02.463 --> 09:03.868
I know you do. Come on.

09:46.787 --> 09:50.147
Oh, man! That is wrong.

09:50.182 --> 09:51.667
Don't freak out.

09:51.702 --> 09:53.227
You can't be doing that to people.

09:53.262 --> 09:54.547
Trust me. You enjoyed it.

09:54.582 --> 09:55.587
That wasn't me!

09:55.622 --> 09:57.987
But you were so up for it.

09:58.022 --> 10:00.187
You kept telling me how much you wanted to be with me.

10:00.222 --> 10:01.747
When I want to tell you something,

10:01.782 --> 10:04.147
I'll tell you myself. You don't know what I'm feeling.

10:04.182 --> 10:05.707
Yeah, well, I see how you look at me.

10:05.742 --> 10:07.787
Yeah? I won't be looking at you any more.

10:07.822 --> 10:09.067
Yes, you will.

10:10.307 --> 10:13.467
You think cos you're beautiful, you can treat people any way you want?

10:13.502 --> 10:15.347
Yeah, that's pretty much how it works.

10:15.382 --> 10:17.107
Haven't you figured that out yet?

10:17.142 --> 10:19.027
You're so messed up.

10:19.062 --> 10:20.747
And you don't even know it.

10:34.080 --> 10:35.840
Are you all right?

10:35.875 --> 10:37.760
Fine.

10:37.795 --> 10:40.080
If you need someone to talk to,

10:40.115 --> 10:42.160
I'm a really good listener.

10:48.200 --> 10:51.360
Hurray! It's the starlet of justice!

10:51.395 --> 10:54.639
I was only saying that the lad that she used to go out with was a dick.

10:54.674 --> 10:56.239
I was only being nice.

10:56.274 --> 10:58.119
Oh, yeah, you were being lovely.

10:58.154 --> 11:00.119
Right up until you threw the chair at her.

11:04.439 --> 11:07.159
Don't be doing that shit around me!

11:07.194 --> 11:08.999
You been in all day?

11:09.034 --> 11:10.679
Yeah.

11:10.714 --> 11:13.519
What happened?

11:13.554 --> 11:15.359
Nothing.

11:15.394 --> 11:17.359
No-one came in.

11:17.394 --> 11:19.759
That's an anti-climax!

11:40.114 --> 11:42.838

I mean, I'm not saying you do.

I don't remember us having sex.

We had sex, right?

11:55.273 --> 11:58.238

Hi.

14:18.630 --> 14:21.115
Nice shirt. That colour really suits you.

14:21.150 --> 14:22.555
Blue.

14:24.155 --> 14:25.595
Are you OK?

15:03.994 --> 15:05.514
We've got a problem.

15:05.549 --> 15:07.714
Will you shut up?!
I nearly had it.

15:07.749 --> 15:08.994
What's he doing?

15:09.029 --> 15:12.354
He's trying to smash the bottle with his mind.

15:18.474 --> 15:20.194
I think he's gonna shit himself.

15:22.594 --> 15:25.034
Oh, bullshit!

15:26.314 --> 15:27.354
We've got a problem.

15:27.389 --> 15:29.954
I've got a power, I know it. I can feel it in my balls.

15:29.989 --> 15:31.194
Listen to me!

15:31.229 --> 15:33.994
It's like a soft vibrating. You get that, yeah?

15:34.029 --> 15:35.034
No.

15:35.069 --> 15:36.874
They're gonna dig up the bodies!

15:36.909 --> 15:40.434
They're building an environmental monitoring station under the flyover.

15:40.469 --> 15:43.194
They're building a what?
That sounds made up.

15:43.229 --> 15:45.034
Are we supposed to know what that is?

15:45.069 --> 15:47.794
It's to measure the carbon monoxide from the flyover.

15:47.829 --> 15:50.673
When they dig the foundations, they'll find the bodies.

15:51.913 --> 15:53.633
We need to move them.

15:53.668 --> 15:57.153
A couple of questions. "How?" "Where?" "Are you out of your mind?!"

15:57.188 --> 15:58.673
If we leave them, they'll find them.

15:58.708 --> 16:02.473
Digging them up and wandering around with them's a low-risk strategy

16:02.508 --> 16:03.473
You got a better idea?

16:03.508 --> 16:05.273
Yeah, I do have a better idea.

16:05.308 --> 16:06.313
Why don't you...

16:06.348 --> 16:09.513
and stop us killing the probation worker in the first place.

16:09.548 --> 16:11.513
You show me how it works, and I'll do it.

16:11.548 --> 16:14.313
We need a car.

16:14.348 --> 16:15.433
Have you got a car?

16:15.468 --> 16:17.593
No.

16:17.628 --> 16:20.033
We should call a cab. A seven-seater.

16:23.313 --> 16:24.273
Where've you been?

16:24.308 --> 16:25.913
I had to go doctor's.

16:25.948 --> 16:27.713
While you were getting your smear test,

16:27.748 --> 16:29.833
we heard the bodies are about to be dug up.

16:29.868 --> 16:33.313
They're building an environmental monitoring station.

16:33.348 --> 16:35.033
Sounds like bullshit.

16:35.068 --> 16:35.393
Can you steal a car?

16:35.428 --> 16:36.393
Can you get a car?

16:36.428 --> 16:38.233
Will you all fuck off?!

16:40.752 --> 16:43.872
All right, touchy. Look, we're a bunch of young offenders

16:43.907 --> 16:47.512
and not one of us knows how to steal a car? That is pathetic.

16:47.547 --> 16:49.352
Look, I'll borrow my dad's car.

16:49.387 --> 16:51.272
You're banned from driving so that makes sense!

16:51.307 --> 16:53.872
You're a whiny little bitch!

16:53.907 --> 16:55.872
Guys, we need to work together.

16:55.907 --> 17:00.352
Think of it as a team-building exercise, huh? I'm feeling this.

17:00.387 --> 17:01.912
Are we feeling this?

17:01.947 --> 17:03.352
Prick.

17:12.152 --> 17:14.392
So what do we do with them when we dig them up?

17:14.426 --> 17:16.791
We weigh them down and toss them in the lake.

17:16.827 --> 17:18.912
Then you know what happens next week?

17:18.946 --> 17:21.952
The council are like, "Let's drag the lake!" So predictable.

17:21.987 --> 17:23.952
Yeah, so we bury them somewhere else.

17:23.987 --> 17:26.512
Enough with the digging and the burying already.

17:26.547 --> 17:28.632
You come up with something then.

17:28.667 --> 17:33.111
We boil them in a bath of sulphuric acid, serial killer style.

17:33.146 --> 17:36.911
Store them at the Community Centre till we decide what to do with them.

17:36.946 --> 17:39.071
Oh, great, the Community Centre!

17:39.106 --> 17:42.071
Cos they have a special room for storing rotting corpses.

17:42.106 --> 17:44.711
There's a disused storeroom upstairs. I've got a key.

17:44.746 --> 17:46.311
Why have you got a key?

17:50.831 --> 17:54.551
I nicked them because I'm living in the Community Centre, OK?

17:54.586 --> 17:58.591
Happy?
Big secret revealed.

17:58.626 --> 17:59.471
Yeah.

18:02.271 --> 18:04.071
This is a sweet ride.

18:25.990 --> 18:27.710
Oh, man!

18:29.350 --> 18:31.270
It stinks!

18:31.305 --> 18:33.510
We must be getting close.

18:44.510 --> 18:47.150
I'm fine.

18:54.385 --> 18:56.030
I've got something.

19:01.230 --> 19:04.990
Oh! Oh! Oh!

19:06.910 --> 19:08.790
Oops.

19:08.825 --> 19:10.229
Ah, man!

19:44.589 --> 19:46.309
You all right?

19:46.344 --> 19:47.749
What?

19:47.784 --> 19:50.149
You're usually a whole lot gobbier than this.

19:50.184 --> 19:51.469
No, I'm not.

19:51.504 --> 19:55.229
Come on, you haven't punched me in a few hours. I'm worried about you.

19:55.264 --> 19:57.269
I'm fine.

20:01.868 --> 20:04.348
How comes you're living in the Community Centre, anyway?

20:06.628 --> 20:09.668
Do we have to be that intimate with each other's lives?

20:09.703 --> 20:11.988
No, I don't think so.

20:12.023 --> 20:14.188
Not so big on the sharing.

20:14.223 --> 20:17.188
I'm not getting a shag now I'm a homeless.

20:17.223 --> 20:18.828
Those Big Issue guys aren't getting any.

20:18.863 --> 20:21.028
Ah, shit! She can hear that!

20:21.063 --> 20:23.388
When are you gonna learn?!

20:28.028 --> 20:29.988
We're set.

20:30.023 --> 20:31.108
Let's go.

20:31.143 --> 20:33.428
Uh, hello?

20:33.463 --> 20:35.868
Don't you think you're forgetting something?

20:37.588 --> 20:39.508
Argh!

20:40.988 --> 20:42.308
Jesus!

20:42.343 --> 20:44.428
Sorry.

20:44.463 --> 20:45.908
Fuck's sake!

21:08.747 --> 21:10.147
Fuck's sake!

21:19.667 --> 21:20.947
I like your cap.

21:20.982 --> 21:22.187
No!

21:22.222 --> 21:23.747
Oh!

21:24.827 --> 21:25.987
Wha...?

21:34.200 --> 21:36.040
Did you know she was bald?

21:36.075 --> 21:38.760
Course not! Twat.

21:38.795 --> 21:40.880
Jesus.

21:40.915 --> 21:42.560
She looked like an alien.

21:42.595 --> 21:44.400
Don't be mean.

21:44.435 --> 21:49.040
She did, didn't she?
A bald alien.

21:49.075 --> 21:50.080
Shh.

21:50.115 --> 21:52.560
I should probably try and find her.

21:52.595 --> 21:53.920
You know.

22:02.199 --> 22:05.639
Can't you see we're trying to have an awkward conversation?

22:07.399 --> 22:08.839
Move.

22:10.519 --> 22:13.679
Go!

22:13.714 --> 22:15.559
The sex wasn't that bad, was it?

22:17.319 --> 22:19.639
You don't get it, do you?

22:22.559 --> 22:25.199
There's nothing wrong with me!

22:25.234 --> 22:27.079
You're the one with the problem!

22:41.479 --> 22:42.919
Kelly?

22:58.638 --> 23:00.078
Kelly?

23:01.998 --> 23:03.438
Oh, sorry, mate.

23:12.958 --> 23:14.038
Kelly?

23:14.073 --> 23:15.518
Go away!

23:15.553 --> 23:16.838
Are you all right?

23:16.873 --> 23:19.238
No, I'm not all right, you prick. I'm bald!

23:20.838 --> 23:24.718
I've got your cap, and your wig.

23:24.753 --> 23:25.718
I don't want you seeing me like this.

23:25.753 --> 23:28.118
All right, I'll close my eyes.

23:28.153 --> 23:30.118
I'll throw them down, OK?

23:30.153 --> 23:32.838
Keep them shut. Don't look!

23:38.237 --> 23:41.917
So I thought that whole moving the bodies thing went pretty well,

23:41.952 --> 23:43.517
you know, considering.

23:45.597 --> 23:48.077
If you laugh at me, I will kick the shit out of ya.

23:48.112 --> 23:50.517
I'm not gonna laugh. Who's laughing?

23:51.637 --> 23:53.077
Well, don't.

23:59.197 --> 24:01.437
So what's with the baldness?

24:03.077 --> 24:07.037
This morning, I was in the shower, and me hair started falling out.

24:07.072 --> 24:08.397
What did the doctor say?

24:08.432 --> 24:11.797
They don't know. They're gonna have to send me for some tests.

24:14.037 --> 24:15.677
So what are we talking about here?

24:15.712 --> 24:17.277
Are we talking about upstairs and down?

24:17.312 --> 24:18.197
What?!

24:18.232 --> 24:19.237
You know.

24:19.272 --> 24:22.157
Do you have a bald fanny?

24:22.192 --> 24:24.077
For fuck's sake! Ow!

24:24.112 --> 24:27.836
Shit, I'm sorry! I'm serious.

24:27.871 --> 24:29.276
Sorry.

24:34.836 --> 24:36.796
Do you want me to walk you home?

24:39.556 --> 24:40.996
All right.

25:13.156 --> 25:16.435
Jodi! Jodi!

25:18.710 --> 25:22.315
Open the door, you bitch!
I know you did it to me!

25:22.350 --> 25:26.315
Open the door! Jodi!

25:44.195 --> 25:48.395
It was her ex-boyfriend, and he's bald! It's Jodi!

25:48.430 --> 25:50.715
She's got this power or something. Oh!

25:50.750 --> 25:53.115
That bitch did this to me!

25:53.150 --> 25:55.995
She has the power to turn people bald?

25:56.030 --> 25:58.795
That is rubbish. Bald, bald, bald.

25:58.830 --> 26:02.155
When I catch her, I'm going to batter her. I'm gonna rip her tits off.

26:04.714 --> 26:06.874
We should bury the bodies under the foundations

26:06.909 --> 26:11.714
of the environmental monitoring station before they pour in the concrete.

26:11.749 --> 26:15.834
So your plan is, we dig up the bodies, and then we re-bury them

26:15.869 --> 26:18.474
in exactly the same place?
You're a genius

26:18.509 --> 26:20.274
That works.

26:20.309 --> 26:22.714
Yeah, that's dead smart.

26:24.314 --> 26:25.634
It's OK.

26:25.669 --> 26:29.194
OK, guys, if you want to grab a box and follow me.

26:30.874 --> 26:32.754
Guys, do you wanna grab a box?

26:32.789 --> 26:37.074
Anyone? Everybody, quick as you can.

26:37.109 --> 26:39.234
Thank you. OK, this way!

26:51.474 --> 26:53.954
Can you get your dad's car again?

26:56.993 --> 26:59.713
So you're talking to me now you want something.

26:59.748 --> 27:01.553
Let's just get this done, all right?

27:01.588 --> 27:03.433
Ask me nicely and I'll think about it.

27:03.468 --> 27:04.233
I ain't begging you.

27:04.268 --> 27:05.633
You're not all that, you know.

27:05.668 --> 27:07.473
You're not even famous any more. You should be grateful.

27:07.508 --> 27:09.673
Grateful? I don't want you near me.

27:09.708 --> 27:11.673
Yeah?

27:12.793 --> 27:15.353
What are you up to now?

27:15.388 --> 27:17.593
Er, I was just going home.

27:17.628 --> 27:19.673
Do you want to go out to the park?

27:21.833 --> 27:25.593
Er... yeah, yeah. Sure.

27:30.553 --> 27:31.633
Where's she going?

27:31.668 --> 27:33.913
Urgh. Is she hooking up with him?

27:33.948 --> 27:35.553
Oh, that is definitely on.

27:35.588 --> 27:37.993
How do we move the bodies without her dad's car?

27:38.028 --> 27:39.593
You need to get that tart on the phone,

27:39.628 --> 27:42.073
and tell her we need her dad's car to shift the stiffs.

27:42.108 --> 27:44.632
Where you going?
We need to move the bodies.

27:44.667 --> 27:46.432
You deal with it!

27:49.752 --> 27:51.712
We could take Sally's car.

27:51.747 --> 27:53.112
Who's Sally?

28:05.832 --> 28:07.672
Pete?

28:07.707 --> 28:09.912
What is it? What's happened?

28:11.512 --> 28:13.312
No, just tell me now.

28:15.312 --> 28:18.272
OK. Give me half an hour, OK? Bye.

28:25.872 --> 28:27.672
I'm sorry you're bald.

28:27.707 --> 28:29.712
Thanks.

28:34.071 --> 28:36.991
Do you want to give us a hand?

28:37.026 --> 28:38.791
I'm the designated driver.

28:38.826 --> 28:40.391
Help us, you prick!

28:44.591 --> 28:48.271
Which one's this?

28:48.306 --> 28:49.671
The probation worker.

28:49.706 --> 28:51.191
He's a fat bastard.

28:54.751 --> 28:56.471
Oh, shit!

28:58.071 --> 29:00.711
Get down, keep down.

29:13.631 --> 29:17.431
You're the one with all the big ideas. What do we do?

29:17.466 --> 29:18.791
Where's the keys?

29:33.910 --> 29:36.230
Shit!

29:48.750 --> 29:51.070
This all right for you?

29:52.710 --> 29:54.830
It's my last day at the community centre tomorrow.

29:56.470 --> 29:58.750
We ship all the clothes out to Africa.

29:59.790 --> 30:01.350
I was there last year.

30:01.385 --> 30:04.830
You should see the conditions these people live in.

30:04.865 --> 30:09.030
No clean water, barely any food.

30:09.065 --> 30:10.430
Makes you think, doesn't it?

30:12.030 --> 30:12.990
What?

30:15.149 --> 30:16.949
Makes you realise how lucky you are.

30:16.984 --> 30:18.709
Oh, shut up.

30:18.744 --> 30:21.149
Where you going?

30:21.184 --> 30:22.549
I want to shag you!

30:22.584 --> 30:25.909
No, please! No, please!

30:25.944 --> 30:26.989
You're so beautiful and slutty.

30:27.024 --> 30:28.109
No, please!

30:28.144 --> 30:32.869
Leave her alone! Get off her! Oh!
I want to have sex with you.

30:32.904 --> 30:34.469
Yeah, me, too.

30:34.504 --> 30:35.109
Me first!

30:35.144 --> 30:36.589
Wait, let me get some...

30:36.624 --> 30:39.029
Get off me! Get off!

30:43.469 --> 30:47.309
Alisha! Alisha!

30:48.989 --> 30:52.269
Someone left the keys in the ignition, but there's no point

30:52.304 --> 30:55.229
naming names at this stage, it's done now. So the probation worker

30:55.264 --> 30:58.989
is driving around with the stiffs in the boot of her car.

30:59.024 --> 31:00.789
Just thought you'd want to know.

31:00.824 --> 31:04.428
Anyway, call me.

31:05.268 --> 31:07.548
I left a message.

31:07.583 --> 31:09.028
Well, I guess that's it.

31:10.468 --> 31:11.628
We're going to prison.

31:11.663 --> 31:13.588
My career teacher said that's where I'd end up.

31:13.623 --> 31:15.028
She'll be giving it all this.

31:15.063 --> 31:19.548
You'll do all right in prison. You've got the whole bald thing. You're well butch.

31:19.583 --> 31:21.868
Ow! Ow!
You know, you hit me a lot.

31:21.903 --> 31:23.508
Yeah, cos you're a dick.

31:23.543 --> 31:25.748
Maybe Sally won't look in the boot.

31:25.783 --> 31:27.668
Fingers crossed, eh?

31:39.948 --> 31:42.548
Alisha! Wait! Wait!

31:43.908 --> 31:45.388
Stop!

31:45.423 --> 31:48.148
Don't touch me!

31:48.183 --> 31:50.028
All right.

31:51.308 --> 31:55.867
Look, whatever I said, or did,

31:55.902 --> 31:57.787
that wasn't me.

31:57.822 --> 31:59.387
I know.

31:59.422 --> 32:00.907
It's me.

32:13.587 --> 32:16.547
I'm gonna stay over here,

32:16.582 --> 32:17.987
all right?

32:21.067 --> 32:23.547
It used to be a good thing, you know...

32:23.582 --> 32:27.227
people wanting to have sex with you. It was nice.

32:28.827 --> 32:30.907
Now it's shit.

32:30.942 --> 32:33.907
I don't know if someone actually wants to sleep with me,

32:33.942 --> 32:36.107
or if it's just this bullshit.

32:36.142 --> 32:38.107
Guys still want to have sex with you.

32:38.142 --> 32:38.907
You didn't.

32:38.942 --> 32:40.427
I did.

32:40.462 --> 32:42.746
Just not like that.

32:45.226 --> 32:47.906
You don't need to use your power on me.

32:49.666 --> 32:52.186
I'm already there.

32:55.226 --> 32:57.626
I don't know how to be like this.

32:57.661 --> 33:00.826
We'll work something out.

33:00.861 --> 33:03.106
It's gonna be all right.

33:08.901 --> 33:11.026
It's Nathan.

33:11.061 --> 33:13.386
They were moving the bodies.

33:13.421 --> 33:15.146
I gotta take it.

33:17.666 --> 33:19.106
What's going on?

33:22.826 --> 33:24.626
What?!

33:34.985 --> 33:37.425
So what's happening?

33:39.225 --> 33:40.585
We think Tony's alive.

33:42.345 --> 33:44.865
He used his credit card to book a flight.

33:44.900 --> 33:48.065
No. It's not him. It can't be.

33:48.100 --> 33:49.665
It was booked in his name.

33:49.700 --> 33:53.025
It's one way, to Spain.

33:53.060 --> 33:54.505
He got on the plane?

33:54.540 --> 33:56.345
The flight's not for another couple of weeks.

33:56.380 --> 33:58.505
Someone must be using his credit card. It's them!

33:58.540 --> 34:01.505
They were the last people to see him. They know something.

34:01.540 --> 34:03.545
I know this is hard.

34:05.865 --> 34:07.745
Maybe he left you.

34:07.780 --> 34:09.985
I don't know.

34:10.020 --> 34:11.705
Maybe there's someone else.

34:13.304 --> 34:15.905
He'd never do that to me.

34:15.940 --> 34:17.344
He wouldn't.

34:42.384 --> 34:44.623
Did any of yous get any sleep last night?

34:44.659 --> 34:47.623
We would have been arrested by now if she'd found the bodies.

34:47.659 --> 34:48.904
Maybe they're waiting until we're all together.

34:48.938 --> 34:50.944
Why would you say something like that?

34:50.978 --> 34:52.464
What time does she usually get here?

34:52.498 --> 34:53.904
About eight o'clock.

35:22.583 --> 35:23.983
She didn't look in the boot.

35:24.018 --> 35:26.383
We're gonna be OK. We're not going to prison!

35:39.503 --> 35:40.703
That's it. That's it.

35:40.738 --> 35:44.503
Yeah, go on, have a nice cup of tea.

35:44.538 --> 35:47.783
I'm shittin' my pants.

35:47.818 --> 35:48.783
Don't, don't...

35:48.818 --> 35:49.903
Oh!

35:54.903 --> 35:57.303
Oh, no!

36:09.422 --> 36:12.622
She didn't look in the boot.

36:12.657 --> 36:15.142
We're gonna be OK. We're not going to prison!

36:17.702 --> 36:21.222
She's going to get out the car walk to the boot, and find the bodies.

36:21.257 --> 36:22.262
How do you know?

36:22.297 --> 36:24.582
It's already happened once.

36:24.617 --> 36:26.182
So now you rewind time?

36:31.422 --> 36:32.862
Get the bodies!

36:36.942 --> 36:39.022
What the hell are you doing?!

36:39.057 --> 36:42.622
It's just pure, mindless vandalism.

36:42.657 --> 36:46.462
What is the matter with you?
Are you mentally deficient?

36:46.497 --> 36:49.422
If I was mentally deficient, I would have missed.

36:49.457 --> 36:52.261
Check that out. Bull's-eye.

36:52.296 --> 36:54.901
My office, now!

36:54.936 --> 36:56.141
Now!

37:35.014 --> 37:37.094
What did you do to me, you fucking bitch?!

37:45.574 --> 37:47.294
What happened to your hair?

37:47.329 --> 37:48.894
I've got alopecia.

37:50.614 --> 37:52.214
It happened when my dad walked out.

37:52.249 --> 37:54.174
I was well stressed.

37:54.209 --> 37:59.294
Oh, this thing itches like a bastard.

37:59.329 --> 38:00.454
You're telling me!

38:05.294 --> 38:06.614
Are you allowed to smoke?

38:06.649 --> 38:08.014
It's not cancer.

38:12.254 --> 38:15.934
Darren broke up with me when my hair started falling out.

38:15.969 --> 38:19.173
He made me feel like no-one would want to be with me.

38:19.208 --> 38:20.493
Such a wanker.

38:20.528 --> 38:24.293
Sometimes I just want people to know how it feels when you feel shit about yourself.

38:24.328 --> 38:26.893
When I feel like that, people go bald.

38:26.928 --> 38:29.733
Please don't tell me this lasts forever.

38:29.768 --> 38:32.693
It only lasts a couple of days. Your hair just comes back.

38:32.728 --> 38:34.133
What about yours?

38:35.733 --> 38:37.253
Man, I hope so.

38:38.893 --> 38:42.253
I'm sorry I hit you - you know, the first time.

38:42.288 --> 38:45.333
Yeah, I'm sorry I called you a slag.

38:45.368 --> 38:48.253
I saw Darren.

38:48.288 --> 38:51.293
Every time I see him, he keeps going bald.

38:51.328 --> 38:52.573
I try to stay away from him.

38:52.608 --> 38:54.533
No way! Bald him up.

38:57.173 --> 38:59.733
Oh, mate, that fucking storm!

39:03.693 --> 39:08.012
Yesterday, in the car, I don't even know what happened.

39:08.047 --> 39:09.732
Forget it.

39:09.767 --> 39:12.772
What's up with her anyway?
One minute we're...

39:12.807 --> 39:14.412
having sex,

39:14.447 --> 39:16.812
the next she won't even talk to me.

39:16.847 --> 39:20.812
She's nuts. Anyway, see you around.

39:49.492 --> 39:51.012
You're a mess.

39:51.047 --> 39:54.212
Yeah... I know.

39:57.851 --> 40:02.611
I want to be with you.

40:04.571 --> 40:07.451
If we're gonna be together,

40:07.486 --> 40:11.091
there's no-one else, yeah?

40:11.126 --> 40:13.331
This is it.

40:17.411 --> 40:19.891
I don't know how to do this. You can't touch me.

40:19.926 --> 40:21.891
I don't want to.

40:21.926 --> 40:23.411
I do...

40:25.491 --> 40:27.851
I really do.

40:27.886 --> 40:29.931
I really want you to.

40:29.966 --> 40:31.371
But you can't.

40:31.406 --> 40:32.811
I know.

40:34.691 --> 40:36.651
So how do we,

40:36.686 --> 40:39.411
you know?

40:39.446 --> 40:41.731
Cos we need to work something out.

40:48.250 --> 40:52.250
We could try phone sex, without the phone.

40:52.285 --> 40:54.130
How's that work?

40:54.165 --> 40:55.770
You know.

40:55.805 --> 40:58.570
We stare at each other and wank ourselves off.

41:00.290 --> 41:02.210
Works for me.

41:05.010 --> 41:07.410
Doesn't matter who's after us now.

41:07.445 --> 41:09.130
They'll never find the bodies.

41:09.165 --> 41:11.690
See ya.

41:11.725 --> 41:14.250
They're gonna think the probation worker's still alive.

41:15.850 --> 41:17.570
I stole his credit card.

41:17.605 --> 41:20.010
I used it to book a flight.

41:20.045 --> 41:21.650
That is smart!

41:21.685 --> 41:23.770
You're dead good at stuff like that.

41:23.805 --> 41:27.090
Yeah! Nice one, weird kid.

41:27.125 --> 41:29.010
I cannot believe we got away with this shit.

41:29.045 --> 41:31.970
We should all go out for a drink - you know, to celebrate.

41:32.005 --> 41:35.610
It's like an ironic "fuck you" to the probation worker.

41:35.645 --> 41:38.929
We're all out having a good time - you're buried under the foundations

41:38.964 --> 41:40.969
of an environmental monitoring station.

41:47.009 --> 41:49.449
See you all tomorrow, yeah?

41:54.409 --> 41:56.129
Later.

42:01.089 --> 42:02.529
Yeah...

42:04.129 --> 42:05.729
D'you want to come for a drink?

42:05.764 --> 42:07.809
Are you asking me out on a date?

42:07.844 --> 42:09.489
No. I meant all of us.

42:09.524 --> 42:11.689
Did you?

42:11.724 --> 42:13.689
I am not your whore.

42:17.369 --> 42:21.489
There is no way I'm going out until my hair grows back.

42:21.524 --> 42:22.969
Sorry.

42:26.368 --> 42:28.528
# I'm naked

42:28.563 --> 42:31.928
# I'm numb I'm stupid

42:31.963 --> 42:33.328
# I'm staying...

42:35.123 --> 42:38.448
# And if Cupid's got a gun

42:38.483 --> 42:39.888
# Then he's shootin'

42:42.688 --> 42:44.848
# Lights black

42:44.883 --> 42:46.528
# Heads bang

42:46.563 --> 42:49.408
# You're my drug, we live it...

42:52.403 --> 42:54.768
# You need it

42:54.803 --> 42:57.848
# Real love, I'll give it

42:57.883 --> 43:00.648
# So we're bound to...

43:00.683 --> 43:05.768
# linger on

43:05.803 --> 43:12.968
# We drink the fatal drop

43:13.003 --> 43:19.967
♪ Then love until we bleed... ♪

43:25.247 --> 43:27.327
My life is fucked!
And that's on you!

43:27.362 --> 43:31.327
I asked you to buy the gear. I should've went to prison.

43:31.362 --> 43:33.247
Hey! Police, hey!

43:35.927 --> 43:38.727
If you're not gonna do anything, then I will.

43:38.762 --> 43:39.807
It's you.

43:39.842 --> 43:40.847
Do I know you?

43:43.567 --> 43:45.047
Ah! Help me!

43:45.082 --> 43:47.647
C'mon, you wankers! Let's have it!

43:47.682 --> 43:49.407
You want me to come with ya?

43:49.442 --> 43:50.847
Give me the fucking money!

43:50.882 --> 43:51.727
I did!

43:53.127 --> 43:54.687
What you smiling about?

43:54.722 --> 43:55.687
I changed the future.
