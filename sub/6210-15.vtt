20:13.789 --> 20:15.544
Well, this whole pirate ordeal started

20:15.711 --> 20:17.466
because we were looking
for the board you need

20:17.634 --> 20:18.989
to decode the family secret.

20:19.155 --> 20:20.955
I see.
So the punishment continues?

20:22.159 --> 20:24.802
- Salem!
SALEM: I tried so hard.

20:24.962 --> 20:26.796
I'm not a puzzle person.

20:26.964 --> 20:29.083
It's okay. It's the effort that counts.

20:30.368 --> 20:31.439
Were you drunk?

20:31.609 --> 20:33.204
We'll just have
to use the other board.

20:33.371 --> 20:35.444
Th--? There's another board?

20:36.014 --> 20:37.450
Duh-heh.

20:40.018 --> 20:42.981
Okay, these are my clues
to the family secret.

20:45.465 --> 20:47.139
Which relative gave me
a picture of fire?

20:47.307 --> 20:49.585
SALEM: One of the pirates.
- I'm related to them?

20:49.749 --> 20:50.867
It involves a third cousin

20:51.031 --> 20:53.229
and a crazy night
in Kingston, Jamaica.

20:53.393 --> 20:56.356
You know, with all the clues
nicely displayed like that,

20:56.517 --> 20:58.556
I still can't begin
to figure out the family secret.

20:58.719 --> 21:00.440
Think it has something
to do with manure?

21:00.601 --> 21:04.441
- Where do you get that?
- I just like saying manure.

21:04.606 --> 21:07.283
[PIRATES YELLING]

21:07.489 --> 21:09.244
- Please?
- I've got an idea.
