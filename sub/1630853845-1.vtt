00:35.708 --> 00:42.583
Okay, this is it, everyone.
We're here to have some fun! Come on!

00:42.708 --> 00:45.458
LANDO: <i>Welcome aboard the</i> Halcyon,

00:45.541 --> 00:49.208
<i>the most luxurious star cruiser</i>
<i>in the galaxy.</i>

00:49.541 --> 00:55.250
<i>I'm Lando Calrissian, newly-appointed</i>
<i>ambassador of the Chandrila Star Line,</i>

00:55.333 --> 00:58.333
<i>where your journey is our privilege.</i>

00:58.625 --> 01:02.000
Hey, look, guys! It's Lando! Hey, Lando!

01:02.083 --> 01:03.500
That's a holo-vid, Finn.

01:03.583 --> 01:07.375
Isn't it great?
No Stormtroopers. No TIE Fighters.

01:07.458 --> 01:09.291
No threat of galactic annihilation.

01:09.375 --> 01:12.708
It'll be an adventure.
A vacation adventure!

01:12.791 --> 01:15.166
It's a nice idea, buddy, but...

01:15.250 --> 01:16.791
Do heroes even take vacations?

01:16.875 --> 01:20.291
Just look at
all these activities. (LAUGHS)

01:20.375 --> 01:23.583
Poe, you love your activities, buddy.

01:23.666 --> 01:27.041
I do. I do love activities.

01:27.125 --> 01:30.583
Okay, first we take a private bridge tour,
followed by a holo-sabacc tournament,

01:30.666 --> 01:33.083
then a quick bite
in the Crown of Corellia Dining Room.

01:33.166 --> 01:36.875
But eat fast, because after that,
it's a brisk walk around the sun deck.

01:36.958 --> 01:40.916
Poe, it's a vacation.
When do we, you know, relax?

01:41.125 --> 01:43.250
I can schedule
five minutes of relaxing time

01:43.333 --> 01:47.000
in between shuffleboard and
the engineering room experience.

01:47.083 --> 01:49.583
-"Engineering room experience"?
-(GRUNTS)

01:49.666 --> 01:54.541
That's the spirit, Poe.
And here, to catch some rays, Rey.

01:54.666 --> 01:56.000
Hmm.

01:56.083 --> 02:01.125
I could use a little R and R and R.
Rest, relaxation, and reading.

02:01.208 --> 02:03.625
Relaxing. With a Jedi text?

02:03.750 --> 02:06.458
You relax your way, I relax mine.

02:07.208 --> 02:08.208
(SLURPING)

02:08.458 --> 02:12.625
-Mmm. This is pretty nice.
-They even have a spa.

02:12.708 --> 02:18.125
Oil baths for everyone.
Finally, we are on holiday.

02:18.208 --> 02:20.958
-It's not that kind of holiday.
-Let it go.

02:21.041 --> 02:23.375
Yeah, but it's... Letting it go.

02:23.458 --> 02:27.583
See? It's gonna be great. We need this.

02:28.333 --> 02:31.125
Especially since it's the last time
we'll all be together.

02:32.458 --> 02:34.333
Anyway, uh, I'll go check us in.

02:34.416 --> 02:37.208
Okay, people, time's wasting.
Let's get a move on.

02:37.291 --> 02:38.291
Where are you going?

02:38.375 --> 02:39.375
REY: To the sun deck.

02:39.458 --> 02:42.416
I'd try to talk you out of it,
but we're already behind schedule.

02:44.791 --> 02:48.625
Okay, Rose and Rey, you're on deck seven,
room three-o-one...

02:48.708 --> 02:54.833
Rey? Rose? Where'd everyone go?
Whole point was to do this all together.

02:56.250 --> 03:01.166
<i>Attention, passengers.</i>
<i>The</i> Halcyon <i>is now departing Chandrila.</i>

03:01.250 --> 03:05.791

03:06.416 --> 03:07.916
<i>Strap in, baby.</i>

03:23.166 --> 03:27.791
Hello, I am BV-RJ, human-cyborg libations.

03:27.875 --> 03:29.291
May I offer you a beverage?

03:29.375 --> 03:31.875
What do you recommend for someone
whose friends ditched him?

03:31.958 --> 03:33.208
BV-RJ: Better friends?

03:34.500 --> 03:37.916
I have just the drink. The Yerdua drop.

03:40.416 --> 03:42.458
This trip sure isn't going like I'd hoped.

03:42.541 --> 03:44.208
MAN: They rarely do.

03:44.291 --> 03:49.875
Right? I, uh... Whoa! What is in this?

03:51.500 --> 03:52.583
Who are you?

03:52.666 --> 03:55.250
Obi-Wan Kenobi. Hello, there.

03:55.375 --> 03:58.291
Obi-Wan Kenobi?
From the Battle of Geonosis?

03:58.375 --> 04:00.583
And the attack on Felucia?
And the Siege of Ryloth?

04:00.666 --> 04:03.083
And... I'm kind of a Clone Wars expert.

04:03.166 --> 04:07.500
It is an honor, sir. General.
Sir General. General Kenobi.

04:07.583 --> 04:10.375
No need to stand on ceremony, young Finn.

04:10.458 --> 04:14.500
Call me Obi-Wan.
We're on vacation after all.

04:16.875 --> 04:20.291
Rey once told me that past Jedi may
appear to help guide us in times of need.

04:20.375 --> 04:24.250
Is that why you're here?
What is it? Is it another Death Star?

04:24.333 --> 04:28.083
A Second Order? Is the Emperor
coming back again... again?

04:28.166 --> 04:32.083
No, I sensed a Jedi in need of counsel.

04:32.208 --> 04:33.916
Oh. Uh...

04:34.125 --> 04:37.250
Rey's somewhere on the ship.
But I'm not sure where.

04:37.333 --> 04:39.250
I'm talking about you.

04:39.333 --> 04:42.833
Me? Oh, I'm good. Ha!

04:42.916 --> 04:46.375
My friends are gone, but I'm hanging out
in an empty lounge with a Jedi ghost.

04:46.458 --> 04:47.708
Finn.

04:47.791 --> 04:48.833
Okay, I'm not good.

04:48.916 --> 04:52.458
My friends are gone and I'm hanging out
in an empty lounge with a Jedi ghost.

04:52.541 --> 04:56.500
It is a vacation, Finn.
They're enjoying themselves.

04:56.583 --> 05:00.083
You must learn to enjoy yourself.

05:00.166 --> 05:02.833
Wait, wait, wait.
What do you know about vacations?

05:02.916 --> 05:08.041
You're telling me the great
Obi-Wan Kenobi took a vacation? Ha!

05:08.208 --> 05:13.416
Well, from a certain point of view.
It was back on Tatooine.

I've been here all day.

05:52.458 --> 05:53.833
STORMTROOPER: There she is.

05:57.208 --> 05:59.541
Show us your identification, Rebel spy.

05:59.625 --> 06:05.083
Me? Oh, I'm no spy.
I'm on vacation with my husband.

06:06.333 --> 06:09.333
STORMTROOPER 1: Vacation? In Mos Eisley?

06:09.500 --> 06:11.333
Mos definitely.

06:11.708 --> 06:13.791
STORMTROOPER 1: Hmm. Identification.

06:13.875 --> 06:17.000
Oh. Identification. Where would I...
Dank farrik.

06:17.083 --> 06:20.416
Honey, did I leave our identification
at the Great Pit of Carkoon?

06:20.875 --> 06:23.333
Which, by the way,
is at best just an okay pit.

06:25.541 --> 06:27.333
I'd stay out of it.

06:28.333 --> 06:31.375
She'd forget her own head
if it weren't already snapped on.

06:31.458 --> 06:33.291
STORMTROOPER 1: Identification. Now.

06:33.791 --> 06:36.166
You don't need to see her identification.

06:36.250 --> 06:38.625
STORMTROOPER 1:
We don't need to see her identification.

06:38.708 --> 06:40.875
She's not the spy you're looking for.

06:40.958 --> 06:43.208
STORMTROOPER 2:
She's not the spy we're looking for.

06:43.291 --> 06:45.208
She will enjoy her trip.

06:45.458 --> 06:47.083
STORMTROOPER 1: Enjoy your trip.

06:48.666 --> 06:53.000
-Whoa. Thank you.
-Ben. My pleasure.

06:53.750 --> 06:56.500
Sorry I can't stay and chat, Ben.
I'm kind of in a rush.

06:57.416 --> 07:00.083
Seriously, don't get involved.

07:00.500 --> 07:02.750
Wait, uh, Miss...

07:03.750 --> 07:06.208
Valeria. Colvett Valeria.

07:06.458 --> 07:10.125
Perhaps you could use
some assistance on your spy mission.

07:10.458 --> 07:13.000
Don't worry, your secret is safe with me.

07:13.083 --> 07:16.916
And your secret is safe with me, Jedi.

07:18.791 --> 07:20.375
So, are you coming or what?

07:22.875 --> 07:25.625
My Rebel cell intercepted
a shipment of coaxium,

07:25.708 --> 07:27.583
but we were ambushed in Hutt Space.

07:27.666 --> 07:30.500
Now Jabba is selling it
back to the Empire.

It's all going down at
Jabba's annual birthday barbecue,

07:35.666 --> 07:39.166
the one day a year
he opens his palace to everyone.

07:39.250 --> 07:41.833
Clever. Doing the deal in plain sight

07:41.916 --> 07:45.125
eliminates the fear
of a double-cross by either side.

07:45.250 --> 07:47.500
Hmm. They won't feel so clever
after we steal it back.

07:48.250 --> 07:49.250

Right. (CLEARS THROAT) Okay.
Here I am, blending in.

Or just relaxed?

08:26.416 --> 08:30.291
Have some food. Mingle.
Maybe you'll overhear something useful.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.583
I moved on to eating.

08:42.166 --> 08:43.791
Have you located the coaxium?

08:43.875 --> 08:47.833
I think so. But it's surrounded by
those Imperials and Jabba's goons.

08:47.916 --> 08:50.625
Somehow, I have to get to it
without them noticing.

08:50.708 --> 08:53.916
-Well, that sounds rather difficult.
-You don't know the half of it.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.916
Turns out, I've had run-ins
with some of these folks in the past.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.625
Them, and them, and them.

09:01.458 --> 09:04.791

give me a life lesson from the Emperor?

that can be sometimes.

27:22.458 --> 27:23.458
FINN: Leia?

27:23.541 --> 27:26.083
That's General Organa to you.

27:26.166 --> 27:28.166
Right, sorry, General.

27:28.791 --> 27:31.750
Finn, I'm teasing. You seem a little lost.

27:31.916 --> 27:33.250
I'm working through some stuff.

27:33.333 --> 27:36.250
Like how to have fun in the moment
like Master Kenobi told me.

27:36.333 --> 27:39.541
Obi-Wan Kenobi said to have fun?

27:39.625 --> 27:41.750
(LAUGHS)

27:42.000 --> 27:44.708
Really? Obi-Wan? Kenobi?

27:44.791 --> 27:48.375
And then, Anakin Skywalker
told me to do what I love.

27:49.250 --> 27:52.208
I've spent more time today
with ghosts than my friends.

27:53.000 --> 27:56.791
No offense, General. And I'm starting
to regret even taking this trip.

27:57.333 --> 28:01.875
Finn, we all need to get away
every now and then. I certainly did.

28:01.958 --> 28:06.708
You? The war hero? The Resistance General?

28:07.208 --> 28:08.625
You're those things, too.

28:08.708 --> 28:10.375
Then why am I having such a hard time?

28:10.458 --> 28:15.833
Because sometimes a vacation is about
more than just having fun. A lot more.

Let me tell you about a trip
Han and I once took.

Great? When a bunch of Stormtroopers
threw you in a pit for him to eat you?

we were gonna make a "fun stop,"

29:04.041 --> 29:06.750
I assumed it would actually be fun.

29:18.958 --> 29:22.666
I never had family vacations growing up.
Or a family.

29:22.750 --> 29:25.166
Oh, he's getting older, Han.

29:25.250 --> 29:28.166
He doesn't wanna slosh around
in his father's memories.

29:28.250 --> 29:30.458
He wants his own adventures.

29:30.541 --> 29:31.750

29:49.458 --> 29:52.708
I'm not. It's this fancy new resort.

29:52.791 --> 29:57.166
It'll be fun family bonding.
What do you say, Son?

29:57.666 --> 29:59.791
Dad! You know what would be really fun?

29:59.875 --> 30:01.708
If I flew us there.

30:03.125 --> 30:07.250
Fly the <i>Falcon?</i>
Uh, maybe someday when you're older.

30:07.333 --> 30:09.583
Oh, you never let me do anything.

30:13.458 --> 30:15.250
You flew at his age.

30:15.333 --> 30:20.583
Speeders and swoops.
And I crashed. A lot. He isn't ready.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.416
Is it possible that you're not ready?

30:23.916 --> 30:28.083
I'm ready. I'm so ready.
Not ready for what?

30:28.666 --> 30:30.625
To let him go.

they were staying with us.

This is so cool!
Oh, and can I have some credits?

32:09.041 --> 32:11.125

He may have other interests.

32:36.375 --> 32:38.708
Maybe later. Have fun.

(SCOFFS) Who's the mouse droid?

33:06.500 --> 33:09.541
Lay off, Rad. This is Ben Solo.

33:09.625 --> 33:12.666
He was just about to tell us what it's
like to fly the <i>Millennium Falcon.</i>

Pff! This little womp rat?

33:15.250 --> 33:16.875

33:18.500 --> 33:20.958
He couldn't even reach the controls,
much less fly.

33:21.041 --> 33:23.208
I fly the <i>Falcon</i> all the time.

33:23.291 --> 33:26.958
Just because your last name is Solo,
it doesn't mean you're a pilot.

33:27.041 --> 33:29.208
Oh, yeah? I'll prove it.

33:31.416 --> 33:34.666
Solo? More like "so low."

34:01.791 --> 34:03.666
Oh, yeah!

34:08.541 --> 34:12.083
This is an awfully long walk
to get to the reception desk.

34:13.291 --> 34:14.916
Oh, it's not much further.

34:15.000 --> 34:20.083
I have to say, when I saw your names
on the guest list, I was intrigued.

34:22.125 --> 34:26.250
You're right, Chewie. We haven't
seen one Ewok since we got here.

34:26.333 --> 34:29.125
Count your blessings. Ewoks, ugh!

34:29.333 --> 34:30.666
They may seem cute and cuddly,

34:30.750 --> 34:33.875
but they're actually
vicious little monsters.

34:33.958 --> 34:38.416
In fact, that's what I wanted
to talk to you about! (YELPS)

34:38.833 --> 34:42.083
Blast it! Oh, you see? Monsters.

34:42.166 --> 34:44.833
But you're not gonna push me
around anymore, you little creeps.

34:44.916 --> 34:46.666
Look who's on my side now.

I am once again a golden god.
You may proceed with the worshipping.

35:18.458 --> 35:20.000
What's going on, Wick?

35:20.083 --> 35:23.666
Yeah. I'm starting to think
this isn't the reception desk.

35:24.625 --> 35:28.625
I might have had an ulterior motive
bringing you out here.

35:28.708 --> 35:32.166
You know, it seems the locals haven't
been exactly quote-unquote thrilled

35:32.250 --> 35:35.333
with my resort, and, you know,
they're trying to muscle me out.

35:35.416 --> 35:38.291
You know, the ush, throwing rocks,

35:38.375 --> 35:41.541
log-rolling the tents,
threatening to eat my guests.

35:41.625 --> 35:44.125
So, I thought if someone
of your stature talked to them,

35:44.208 --> 35:45.708
that maybe they would back off.

35:45.791 --> 35:49.500
And now that I see you are all friends...

35:50.833 --> 35:55.166
I don't know. Real estate disputes
aren't exactly our area of expertise.

35:55.250 --> 35:57.333
Besides, it was their moon first.

35:57.416 --> 36:01.291
I know, but a guy gets a little unlucky,
makes a bad deal?

36:01.375 --> 36:03.166
Gets out over his skiffs?

36:03.250 --> 36:05.791
-I kind of relate.

agree to back off on one condition.

I didn't mean to!

There are no known asteroid fields

38:48.375 --> 38:50.583
Great, kid. Don't get cocky.

38:53.750 --> 38:54.791
SIDERO: Look out, Ben!

38:55.291 --> 38:57.166
(ALL SCREAMING)

39:08.625 --> 39:09.875
Yahoo!

39:10.041 --> 39:12.166
HAN: <i>I couldn't have done it</i>
<i>any better myself.</i>

39:15.000 --> 39:17.791
Are they, uh, definitely okay?

39:17.875 --> 39:19.625
(SIGHS IN RELIEF) Absolutely.

39:19.708 --> 39:22.041
Then, could somebody cut me down?

39:22.125 --> 39:24.583
Because the blood is rushing to my head.

39:29.541 --> 39:31.541
(GRUNTS)

39:32.791 --> 39:36.083
C-3PO: Artoo, thank the stars
you are safe.

39:37.083 --> 39:38.458
Oh, cool, a barbecue!

39:42.166 --> 39:45.291
Oh, my sweet little girl. (KISSING)

39:45.833 --> 39:51.666
Oh, Daddy is so glad his brave little
porgie-worgie pie is okay.

39:51.750 --> 39:56.083
-Dad, everyone's watching.
-I don't care.

39:56.375 --> 39:58.375
(CHEWBACCA BELLOWS)

39:58.458 --> 40:00.625
Thanks, Chewie. (LAUGHS)

40:04.291 --> 40:08.250
Ben! You were amazing up there
with the lasers, and the blasting.

40:08.333 --> 40:10.500
And the turning in the... Oh, my gosh.

40:10.583 --> 40:12.250
Oh, it was nothing.

40:13.250 --> 40:14.458
See you around, Ben.

40:14.541 --> 40:17.041
-(LAUGHING)
-(R2-D2 WHISTLES)

40:18.375 --> 40:21.833
-Best vacation ever!
-(R2-D2 BEEPS)

40:39.708 --> 40:41.166
(BELLOWS)

40:41.250 --> 40:43.416
I'll miss you, too, Chewie.

40:45.875 --> 40:48.000
You're going to love lightsaber training.

40:48.083 --> 40:51.375
Try not to lose a hand.
It's kind of a thing in our family.

40:51.458 --> 40:54.500
-Okay, Mom.
-We love you so much.

40:55.041 --> 40:57.208
You flew the <i>Falcon</i>
through a debris field,

40:57.291 --> 40:59.416
saved the day, and got your first kiss.

40:59.500 --> 41:00.500
Dad.

41:00.583 --> 41:03.666
I'm just saying,
the trip wasn't all bad, right?

41:04.041 --> 41:07.666
-I guess not.
-Well, I guess this is it.

41:08.041 --> 41:10.500
-Yeah.
-You listen to your Uncle Luke.

41:10.791 --> 41:11.791
I will.

41:14.916 --> 41:18.458
Son? I love you.

41:19.750 --> 41:20.750
I know.

41:31.833 --> 41:33.791
-FINN: Was it hard?
-Was what hard?

41:33.875 --> 41:34.916
Saying goodbye.

41:35.375 --> 41:40.250
It was the hardest. But it was also time.
Why do you ask?

41:40.333 --> 41:43.333
'Cause I'm starting to realize that
I don't know if I can do it.

41:43.416 --> 41:45.416
We're all about to go our separate ways.

41:45.500 --> 41:48.333
Rey is headed to the Unknown Regions
to search for Jedi temples.

41:48.416 --> 41:51.666
Poe's training new X-Wing pilots.
Rose is off to lead relief missions,

41:51.750 --> 41:54.625
and I'm gonna scour the galaxy
for others like me.

41:54.708 --> 41:56.625
Others who are strong in the Force.

41:56.708 --> 41:58.666
Who knows when
we'll all be together again?

41:58.750 --> 42:01.458
Perhaps that's why this trip
has been so difficult.

42:01.541 --> 42:03.458
-For all of you.
-All of us?

42:03.541 --> 42:07.291
Is it possible that none of you
are ready to say goodbye?

42:08.583 --> 42:13.416
Finn, a wise Jedi once told me,
"No one's ever really gone."

42:15.041 --> 42:16.250
Thank you, General.

42:18.083 --> 42:21.791
-C-3PO: Oh, there is Master Finn.
-We've been looking all over for you.

42:21.875 --> 42:24.583
-FINN: And I've been looking for you.
-We're sorry, buddy.

42:24.666 --> 42:25.791
For what?

42:25.875 --> 42:28.458
You arranged this amazing vacation
for us to be together,

42:28.541 --> 42:31.625
but we all went off
and did our own things.

42:32.125 --> 42:36.625
That's okay. I realized I planned this
trip because I was avoiding something.

42:36.708 --> 42:38.000
Saying goodbye.

42:38.083 --> 42:39.083
He's right.

42:39.166 --> 42:41.666
-I've been feeling it, too.
-This trip is the end.

42:41.750 --> 42:44.583
Exactly.
But a trip isn't about the destination.

42:44.666 --> 42:48.583
It's about the journey. Enjoying
the moments for as long as they last.

42:48.666 --> 42:51.416
Oh, no. Don't you do it.
Don't go mushy on me.

42:51.500 --> 42:53.000
Remember how we first met?

42:53.083 --> 42:55.750
FN-2187.
That's the only name they ever gave me.

42:55.833 --> 42:58.750
Well, I ain't using it. I'm gonna
call you Finn. Is that all right?

42:59.166 --> 43:00.708
You gave me a name, Poe.

43:00.791 --> 43:03.708
Oh, you did it. You went mushy on me.

43:04.416 --> 43:06.125
(BLOWS NOSE)

43:08.375 --> 43:10.708
And, Rey, remember
the marketplace on Jakku?

43:11.583 --> 43:13.291
-(GRUNTS)
-(COUGHS)

43:15.583 --> 43:16.583
Follow me.

43:17.708 --> 43:23.458
You gave me purpose, Rey.
And, Rose, you gave me hope.

43:23.541 --> 43:24.666
Why would you stop me?

43:24.750 --> 43:28.708
I saved you. That's how we win.
Saving what we love.

43:31.375 --> 43:34.625
I've been told that you have to
do what you love.

43:34.708 --> 43:38.708
Well, I've loved fighting alongside
all of you. I'm gonna miss that.

43:38.791 --> 43:42.166
I didn't want to admit it to myself,
but I never wanted those feelings to end.

43:42.250 --> 43:44.041
That's why I planned this trip.

43:44.125 --> 43:48.125
But with the memories we've shared,
well, no one's ever really gone.

43:50.416 --> 43:56.291
Hey! The trip's just getting started.
Oh! I know what we should do now.

43:56.375 --> 44:01.250
-Better not be a trash compactor.
-Group hug? Come on.

44:01.333 --> 44:05.791
C-3PO: This is really
quite pleasant. Chewbacca!

44:05.875 --> 44:08.291
-(CHEWBACCA BELLOWS)
-No, Chewie. That hug's perfect.

44:08.875 --> 44:13.458
<i>We hope you are enjoying your adventure</i>
<i>aboard the</i> Halcyon.

44:13.541 --> 44:19.458
<i>Although every trip must eventually end,</i>
<i>the memories never do.</i>

44:19.541 --> 44:25.916
<i>So, we thank you, for joining us,</i>
<i>and may the Force be with you.</i>
