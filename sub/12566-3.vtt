Oh, hi.

00:02.115 --> 00:03.182
I'm Evan R. Lawson,

00:03.216 --> 00:04.783
your Interim Hospital Administrator,

00:04.818 --> 00:07.319
here to let you know about
my new weekly video blog,

00:07.354 --> 00:08.721

00:08.755 --> 00:11.457
Check it out on the
internal employee website,

you probably already have

00:12.992 --> 00:14.326

00:14.361 --> 00:17.162

00:17.197 --> 00:19.932
that my door is always open.

00:19.966 --> 00:21.934
My mind is always open.

00:21.968 --> 00:24.603
Basically I just want things
to be really open around here.

00:24.637 --> 00:26.905
I believe in complete transparency,

00:26.940 --> 00:28.407
and I hope you do too.

00:28.441 --> 00:29.641
So if you see me in the halls,

00:29.676 --> 00:31.043
don't be afraid to come up to me,

00:31.077 --> 00:33.245
look me right in the eye,
and engage with me.

00:33.279 --> 00:34.646
Just to sum up:

00:34.681 --> 00:38.517
Evan R. Lawson. Complete. Transparency.

00:38.551 --> 00:40.986
Thanks a lot for watching.
I'll see you next week.

00:49.496 --> 00:50.462
- Very.
- Great.

00:50.497 --> 00:51.764
I just want everyone to know that while

00:51.798 --> 00:53.132
I'm only here temporarily,
I'm fully committed.

00:53.166 --> 00:54.466
Nailed it.

00:54.501 --> 00:55.667
And I think it'll help if the hospital staff

00:55.702 --> 00:56.769
knows they can talk to me about anything.

00:56.803 --> 00:58.036
So that's why I'm going for...

00:58.071 --> 00:59.104
- Complete transparency.
- Yeah.

00:59.139 --> 01:00.539
Yes, that is completely transparent.

01:00.573 --> 01:01.540
Great.

Now I just have to motivate them, right?

01:32.172 --> 01:33.672
On the bright side,

01:33.706 --> 01:35.073
these loose-fitting pants they suggested

01:35.108 --> 01:36.542
are insanely comfortable.
