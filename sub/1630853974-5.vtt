WEBVTT

00:21.063 --> 00:23.899
Hurry up, girls!
We're about to call places!

00:23.899 --> 00:25.317
Hurry up.

00:25.317 --> 00:27.236
Dede, pass me the Vaseline.

00:27.236 --> 00:29.571
Going live
in three minutes.

00:29.571 --> 00:31.323
Does anybody have
a pin?

00:31.323 --> 00:32.491
Uh, where is it?

00:32.491 --> 00:34.326
- Oh, my God, thank you.
- Is it all right?

00:34.326 --> 00:35.786
Toni, where's my makeup bag?

00:35.786 --> 00:37.204
You think I need
more padding?

00:38.413 --> 00:39.748
Ugh, the strap!

00:39.748 --> 00:41.667
Fix your hair, Mary.

00:41.667 --> 00:43.794
Hurry up.
Let's go.

00:43.794 --> 00:46.672
The truth is,
beauty is just a cover.

00:46.672 --> 00:50.509
It makes things seem better,
but it's still a lie.

00:50.509 --> 00:54.429
The truth is, this is
the worst day of my life.

00:54.429 --> 00:56.848
<i>I only entered pageants
'cause I was tired</i>

00:56.848 --> 00:59.351
<i>of seeing blonde-haired girls
take the crown.</i>

00:59.351 --> 01:01.061
<i>Seeing that as a kid meant</i>

01:01.061 --> 01:03.313
<i>that girls like me
were invisible.</i>

01:03.313 --> 01:07.609
<i>Heck no!
I was gonna change that.</i>

01:07.609 --> 01:11.363
Well, tell us about yourself,
Miss Black Rhode Island.

01:11.363 --> 01:15.784
Me? Well, I just graduated
from Coventry High School.

01:15.784 --> 01:17.744
I made
the National Honor Society

01:17.744 --> 01:19.621
and varsity cheerleader.

01:19.621 --> 01:21.039
I play softball.

01:21.039 --> 01:24.167
I'm a teen usher
at Ebenezer Baptist.

01:24.167 --> 01:27.713
And I hope to be the first
Black female president.

01:27.713 --> 01:30.048
Hi.

01:30.048 --> 01:32.050
I'm Miss Oklahoma,
your roommate.

01:32.050 --> 01:34.636
Oh, hi, I'm mortified.

01:34.636 --> 01:35.929
Kycia.
Don't be.

01:35.929 --> 01:37.264
It's all right.

01:37.264 --> 01:39.558
I'm mortified by myself
at least six times a day.

01:39.558 --> 01:41.810
Desiree Washington.
I talk a lot.

01:41.810 --> 01:43.729
I was voted most talkative
in school.

01:43.729 --> 01:46.773
I mean, I'm nervous.
Can you tell?

01:46.773 --> 01:48.608
Girl, I'm pinching myself.

01:48.608 --> 01:50.402
I hear Jesse Jackson,
Johnny Gill,

01:50.402 --> 01:52.529
and Danny Glover
are around here somewhere.

01:52.529 --> 01:54.906
Okay, that would
make me shut up.

01:54.906 --> 01:56.700
Wouldn't even
remember my name.

01:56.700 --> 01:58.452
Right, 'cause
we don't have famous people

01:58.452 --> 02:00.245
like that in Oklahoma.

02:00.245 --> 02:03.832
We do in Rhode Island,
but not the good kind.

02:03.832 --> 02:06.335
I didn't realize
how big a deal this was.

02:06.335 --> 02:07.669
Oh, it's a big deal.

02:07.669 --> 02:09.171
And we're gonna get
in big trouble

02:09.171 --> 02:11.965
if we don't get to rehearsal,
like, now.

02:11.965 --> 02:14.634
The Miss Black America
franchise was started

02:14.634 --> 02:17.220
because Black women
were not presented

02:17.220 --> 02:18.805
in the Miss America Pageant.

02:18.805 --> 02:22.351
You young women are expected
to set the standard

02:22.351 --> 02:24.686
for Black beauty
and Black excellence.

02:24.686 --> 02:28.315
Today, Miss Black America,
tomorrow, Miss America.

02:28.315 --> 02:31.151
Maybe one of us'll be
the next Vanessa Williams.

02:31.151 --> 02:32.903
Fun fact,
a lot of Black girls wanted

02:32.903 --> 02:35.947
to go to Syracuse University
after she won, like a lot.

02:35.947 --> 02:39.159
As contestants of the
Miss Black America franchise,

02:39.159 --> 02:43.205
you are required to take
an Oath of Positivity.

02:43.205 --> 02:46.958
Would you please stand
and recite this with me?

02:46.958 --> 02:48.835
My actions
and my attitude

02:48.835 --> 02:51.838
will always reflect
positivity in my mind.

02:51.838 --> 02:54.841
My illustrious smile
will always express

02:54.841 --> 02:57.469
the pleasure I receive
from living...

02:57.469 --> 02:59.096
All right.

02:59.096 --> 03:01.223
Maybe that sounds
like corn right off the cob,

03:01.223 --> 03:05.727
but in that moment,
I was celebrating Black women.

03:05.727 --> 03:08.605
I was proud to be one of them.

03:08.605 --> 03:09.940
Later, this man...

03:09.940 --> 03:11.358
Will always express--

03:11.358 --> 03:14.361
Accused Mike of being
a serial buttocks fondler

03:14.361 --> 03:17.781
and sued him for $20 million.

03:30.001 --> 03:33.380
Suzanna, it's not the left.
Everyone's turning right.

03:33.380 --> 03:37.426
Kick ball change, jazz square,
kick ball change, jazz square.

03:37.426 --> 03:40.846
It's Mike!

03:40.846 --> 03:44.474
Ladies, ladies,
calm down, calm down.

03:48.061 --> 03:49.896
Mike.

03:49.896 --> 03:52.274
Thanks for coming.
Thanks for doing the promo.

03:52.274 --> 03:55.277
Happy to help shine a light
on all this Black excellence.

03:55.277 --> 03:57.362
Mm-hmm, ladies,
did you hear that?

03:57.362 --> 03:59.698
Let's show Mike
what we've been working on.

03:59.698 --> 04:02.284
Mike, all you'll have to do
is recite your lines,

04:02.284 --> 04:04.369
and the girls will do the rest,
all right?

04:04.369 --> 04:08.248
Ladies, here we go,
five, six, seven, eight, and...

04:09.458 --> 04:11.251
Action, rehearsal.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.670
I'm in a dream
day after day.

04:13.670 --> 04:15.964
Beautiful women
in such an array.

04:15.964 --> 04:18.133
What can I say?

04:22.596 --> 04:24.931
You're a nice
little Christian girl, huh?

04:24.931 --> 04:27.809
You look like a nice
little Christian girl.

04:27.809 --> 04:33.231
Yeah, I am... a girl--
a Christian, I mean, yeah.

04:33.231 --> 04:36.067
Do you want
to go out tonight?

04:36.067 --> 04:38.069
Um, sure.

04:38.069 --> 04:39.529
That means you gotta
give me your number

04:39.529 --> 04:41.531
so I can call you later.

04:41.531 --> 04:44.493
Come here, come here.

04:50.790 --> 04:52.292
Hello?

04:52.292 --> 04:54.503
<i>Desiree?</i>

04:54.503 --> 04:58.507
It's him, it's him.

04:58.507 --> 05:00.300
Hello?
<i>Is this is Desiree?</i>

05:00.300 --> 05:02.344
Yeah, this is Desiree.

05:02.344 --> 05:03.887
<i>I'm outside.</i>
- It's Mike Tyson.

05:03.887 --> 05:06.139
<i>Can you come out?
I want to see you.</i>

05:06.139 --> 05:08.433
Right now?
<i>Yeah.</i>

05:08.433 --> 05:11.228
- You come up.
- Bitch, I'm in rollers.

05:11.228 --> 05:12.812
Maybe my friend Pasha
can come with me.

05:13.855 --> 05:15.023
Now, come on.

05:15.023 --> 05:16.358
I just wanna talk.

05:16.358 --> 05:18.151
I don't wanna know Pasha.
I wanna know you.

05:18.151 --> 05:19.528
He's probably gonna take you

05:19.528 --> 05:21.321
to one of those celebrity
after-parties.

05:21.321 --> 05:23.740
You have to go.

05:23.740 --> 05:25.909
Okay.

05:30.997 --> 05:33.250
Oh, no.
No, no, no.

05:33.250 --> 05:34.543
<i>Who are you?</i>

05:35.877 --> 05:37.546
<i>Perfect!</i>

05:37.546 --> 05:39.297
Yes, yes, yes!

05:39.297 --> 05:40.590
- You good.
- Yes!

05:40.590 --> 05:42.759
Okay, go!
Go, you're in a race!

05:44.386 --> 05:47.597
My dad is gonna want
a photo of me and Mike Tyson!

05:49.391 --> 05:51.059
Oh, my God!
I know!

06:05.448 --> 06:08.451
How may I help you, dear?

06:10.579 --> 06:12.706
I was raped.

06:17.002 --> 06:18.503
I'm going to insert a speculum

06:18.503 --> 06:20.755
into your vagina to check
for internal injuries, okay?

06:30.390 --> 06:33.476
My initial exam shows damage
to her introitus.

06:33.476 --> 06:35.061
What does that mean?

06:35.061 --> 06:37.814
It means that
something happened to you.

06:39.190 --> 06:43.403
I've only seen injuries like
that in nonconsensual sex.

06:43.403 --> 06:46.406
What if I'm pregnant
or--or something?

06:46.406 --> 06:48.366
What if he has a disease?

06:48.366 --> 06:50.493
The likelihood
of pregnancy is unlikely,

06:50.493 --> 06:52.037
given that you're menstruating,

06:52.037 --> 06:54.706
but we will need to run
an STD panel,

06:54.706 --> 06:56.499
including an HIV test.

06:56.499 --> 06:58.877
AIDS?

06:58.877 --> 07:01.880
What?
I can't.

07:04.924 --> 07:08.386
How is this happening?

07:08.386 --> 07:11.306
I grabbed my camera
because I knew

07:11.306 --> 07:14.309
my dad would want pictures
of me and Mike.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.815
Can I be anonymous?

07:20.815 --> 07:24.569
I mean, do you have
to use my name?

07:24.569 --> 07:27.781
I don't want anyone
to know what happened to me.

07:29.658 --> 07:32.285
You'll have to testify.

07:32.285 --> 07:34.287
Publicly.

07:37.082 --> 07:39.084
You don't have to do this.

07:39.084 --> 07:41.044
We can take you home right now.

07:41.044 --> 07:42.545
I'm so stupid.

07:42.545 --> 07:46.675
No, don't say that.
This is not your fault.

07:46.675 --> 07:50.053
We can put all this behind us.

07:50.053 --> 07:52.263
I'm so sorry, Mom.

07:52.263 --> 07:54.891
I have to do this.

07:54.891 --> 07:56.768
Baby...

08:04.442 --> 08:06.569
"Some African American
religious leaders

08:06.569 --> 08:09.406
"are asking Washington
to drop the case

08:09.406 --> 08:12.117
for the sake
of African American unity."

08:12.117 --> 08:14.035
Un-fucking believable.

08:14.035 --> 08:15.954
It's too much.

08:15.954 --> 08:18.039
There's too many out there
with too many opinions.

08:18.039 --> 08:20.250
Who's gonna protect Desiree?
- Mom--

08:20.250 --> 08:24.337
No, you're just a baby,
my baby.

08:24.337 --> 08:27.465
Some Black folks
will fight us on this.

08:27.465 --> 08:30.093
They don't want us
taking away their hero.

08:30.093 --> 08:31.636
Free Mike, free Mike!

08:31.636 --> 08:35.306
Free Mike, free Mike,
free Mike, free Mike!

08:35.306 --> 08:37.434
Mike Tyson has been
in the ring before,

08:37.434 --> 08:39.144
but now he must fight
his accuser.

08:39.144 --> 08:41.062
He--now he is
in the fight of his life,

08:41.062 --> 08:43.690
and I support him 1,000%.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.988
Free Mike Tyson!

08:56.995 --> 09:00.790
<i></i> Our Father,
who art in heaven,

09:00.790 --> 09:02.709
hallowed be thy name.

09:02.709 --> 09:04.377
Thy kingdom come...

09:04.377 --> 09:07.630
<i>I don't want to just
be the girl who got raped.</i>

09:07.630 --> 09:09.841
<i>I want to be Desiree.</i>

09:12.177 --> 09:15.221
Dez for prez, go Oakers.

09:15.221 --> 09:17.140
Out!

09:17.140 --> 09:19.559
Boo-yah!

09:22.020 --> 09:24.147
I'm still that girl.

09:31.112 --> 09:32.697
<i>When I walked in,</i>

09:32.697 --> 09:35.867
<i>I kept telling myself,
"Just look straight ahead.</i>

09:35.867 --> 09:38.703
<i>"Don't cry.
Don't cry.</i>

09:38.703 --> 09:41.164
<i>"Don't give him
that satisfaction.</i>

09:41.164 --> 09:43.958
<i>Don't let him
take another thing."</i>

09:45.919 --> 09:48.421
Please raise your right hand,
Ms. Washington.

09:48.421 --> 09:49.964
Do you swear to tell the truth,

09:49.964 --> 09:52.634
the whole truth, and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?

09:52.634 --> 09:54.636
I do.

10:02.644 --> 10:04.771
Ms. Washington.

10:04.771 --> 10:06.481
Now, in your own words,
please tell the court

10:06.481 --> 10:08.483
about the events that occurred
in Mike Tyson's suite

10:08.483 --> 10:11.986
in the early hours
of July 19th, 1991.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.707
Wow.

10:24.707 --> 10:27.752
There's three of us in a room
half this size at the Omni.

10:27.752 --> 10:29.295
But it's cool.

10:29.295 --> 10:31.172
The girls are
so super sweet and--

10:31.172 --> 10:33.550
The TV's in there.

10:33.550 --> 10:35.802
I thought you just needed
to grab something

10:35.802 --> 10:38.763
before we go out.

10:38.763 --> 10:42.433
I just wanna talk
a little bit.

11:04.330 --> 11:07.417
So tell me about yourself.

11:07.417 --> 11:10.962
Well, I'm 18.

11:10.962 --> 11:13.756
I'm gonna be a freshman
in college,

11:13.756 --> 11:15.967
which I'm
kind of nervous about.

11:15.967 --> 11:19.596
I mean, I've never been away
from home or my sister.

11:19.596 --> 11:21.598
They even honored me
in my home church.

11:21.598 --> 11:24.601
Well, not just me,
all the graduating seniors.

11:24.601 --> 11:29.647
They're all rooting for us.
But I'm gonna make them proud.

11:29.647 --> 11:33.985
You can stop me at any time.
I talk a lot.

11:33.985 --> 11:35.653
Yeah, you talk a lot.

11:35.653 --> 11:37.322
I know.

11:41.200 --> 11:44.537
You like birds, right?
Pigeons?

11:44.537 --> 11:47.081
So you know a little
about me, huh?

11:47.081 --> 11:49.876
My dad, my brother,
and my grandfather--

11:49.876 --> 11:51.753
they're all big fans.

11:51.753 --> 11:54.005
You think they'd like me?

11:54.005 --> 11:56.424
Sure, you seem okay.

11:56.424 --> 11:59.052
Okay.

11:59.052 --> 12:02.222
You keep talking like that.
You're turning me on.

12:03.806 --> 12:06.059
I...

12:06.059 --> 12:08.519
I'm not that kind of girl.

12:08.519 --> 12:10.521
One-night stands
are not my thing.

12:10.521 --> 12:12.774
I don't do that.

12:12.774 --> 12:14.901
Yeah, you're
a good Christian girl.

12:14.901 --> 12:16.611
I get it.

12:16.611 --> 12:18.905
I just thought
we could have a little fun.

12:21.908 --> 12:25.161
Um... I gotta use
the restroom.

12:25.161 --> 12:26.621
Excuse me.

12:26.621 --> 12:28.498
Yeah, sure.

13:20.383 --> 13:22.218
<i>Leave me alone.</i>

13:22.218 --> 13:25.054
Leave me alone.

13:25.054 --> 13:27.557
Don't fight me.
Don't do this.

13:27.557 --> 13:31.227
<i>He started sticking his hands
in my vagina</i>

13:31.227 --> 13:34.647
<i>and sucking on my breast,</i>

13:34.647 --> 13:38.109
<i>and then he licked me
from my rectum to my vagina.</i>

13:38.109 --> 13:39.777
<i>And then he penetrated me.</i>

13:43.072 --> 13:47.118
I was trying to squirm away,
but just he kept saying,

13:47.118 --> 13:49.078
"Don't fight me.
Just relax."

13:49.078 --> 13:51.956
And he kept saying that
and saying that, like,

13:51.956 --> 13:54.417
that was the thing
at that point.

13:54.417 --> 13:57.670
"Don't fight me.
Don't fight me, just relax."

13:57.670 --> 13:59.380
And I was very nervous,

13:59.380 --> 14:02.425
and I said, "I don't do
one-night stands,"

14:02.425 --> 14:04.719
and "you don't have
a condom on,"

14:04.719 --> 14:06.471
and "Leave me alone.

14:06.471 --> 14:08.014
"I have a future ahead of me.

14:08.014 --> 14:10.183
You're gonna get me pregnant."
Don't do this...

14:10.183 --> 14:13.102
I was trying really hard
to get away,

14:13.102 --> 14:15.229
but the harder I fought,

14:15.229 --> 14:20.318
the more aggressive
and violent he became.

14:20.318 --> 14:24.030
He said,
"I don't need a condom."

14:24.030 --> 14:27.742
He says,
"We'll just have a baby."

14:27.742 --> 14:30.328
That was the statement he made.

14:30.328 --> 14:32.830
And I'm just like,

14:32.830 --> 14:36.292
"I'm gonna go to college.
I don't care who you are.

14:36.292 --> 14:38.252
"I don't care
that you're a celebrity.

14:38.252 --> 14:40.004
I just don't do this."

14:40.004 --> 14:44.383
And I made that
very, very clear to him.

14:44.383 --> 14:48.638
And he just kept
saying over again,

14:48.638 --> 14:52.600
"Don't fight me.
Don't fight me."

15:13.704 --> 15:16.624
You don't love me no more?

15:25.716 --> 15:30.346
When I met him,
I thought he was a nice person.

15:30.346 --> 15:32.390
People are gonna think
it's my fault.

15:37.562 --> 15:40.523
A lot of people
want to know why you would

15:40.523 --> 15:43.818
show up at a man's hotel room
at 2:00 a.m.

15:43.818 --> 15:46.612
He said he needed
to grab something.

15:46.612 --> 15:48.447
I thought we were going
to a party.

15:48.447 --> 15:51.033
I didn't think anything of it.
He's famous.

15:51.033 --> 15:52.535
I don't want to be up here

15:52.535 --> 15:54.662
attacking
a successful Black man.

15:54.662 --> 15:58.291
I really don't,
but I should be able to go out

15:58.291 --> 16:00.585
with any man
and not expect to be raped.

16:14.473 --> 16:17.018
<i>You bring
a hawk to a chicken yard,</i>

16:17.018 --> 16:19.604
and you wonder why
the chickens get eaten up.

16:19.604 --> 16:23.024
You bring Mike
to a beauty contest,

16:23.024 --> 16:28.196
and all these fine foxes are
parading in front of Mike.

16:28.196 --> 16:30.907
Mike's eyes begin
to dance like a hungry man

16:30.907 --> 16:33.534
looking at a Wendy's
beef burger or something.

16:33.534 --> 16:37.622
<i>He wants to see if it's
as good as it looks.</i>

16:41.292 --> 16:45.171
How was she out
at 1:00 in the morning?

16:45.171 --> 16:47.590
Who'd she tell?
- 2:00 in the morning!

16:47.590 --> 16:50.593
2:00 in the morning?
That's even worse.

16:50.593 --> 16:54.263
What, you gon' sit
in a limo with Mike?

16:54.263 --> 16:58.351
You know, "Honest Mike"?

16:58.351 --> 17:00.436
Come on, sisters.

17:00.436 --> 17:01.854
<i>How many times have
you said no,</i>

17:01.854 --> 17:03.439
<i>and you really mean
yes all the time?</i>

17:03.439 --> 17:04.982
Bring it on!

17:04.982 --> 17:07.902
No, wait, no, wait,

17:07.902 --> 17:10.154
I'm talking to the women now.

17:10.154 --> 17:12.615
'Cause we gonna talk now!

17:12.615 --> 17:15.743
See, the days
of your BS is over!

17:15.743 --> 17:18.496
You're not dealing with a man
that don't know you

17:18.496 --> 17:23.459
<i>and the damn deceitful games
you women play.</i>

17:23.459 --> 17:26.796
<i>The people call
Mary Washington to the stand.</i>

17:26.796 --> 17:31.842
Desiree is--was--

17:31.842 --> 17:35.680
always so happy,

17:35.680 --> 17:39.976
always smiling and dancing.

17:39.976 --> 17:43.813
She was so confident,

17:43.813 --> 17:46.274
the daughter
every parent wants.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.944
Then when I saw her
after what happened,

17:49.944 --> 17:52.363
she was a different girl.

17:53.906 --> 17:58.494
We took her home,
back to Rhode Island.

17:58.494 --> 18:03.457
I hoped that her being
around people that loved her

18:03.457 --> 18:05.459
would help
bring back her spark.

18:08.212 --> 18:10.381
<i>
You have another nightmare?</i>

18:10.381 --> 18:13.884
I'm afraid to fall asleep.
He's always there.

18:13.884 --> 18:17.596
We're gonna get through this,
you and me.

18:17.596 --> 18:20.891
He doesn't get to take
anything else from you.

18:20.891 --> 18:23.644
Don't give him
that much of your soul.

18:23.644 --> 18:26.522
And you telling the truth?

18:26.522 --> 18:29.108
It's gonna set you free, Desiree.

18:33.362 --> 18:36.574
I'm not Desiree anymore.

18:36.574 --> 18:39.535
Desiree's gone,
and she's not coming back.

18:45.583 --> 18:51.422
She slept in our bed
all summer--all summer long--

18:51.422 --> 18:54.216
till it was time for her
to go back to college.

18:57.011 --> 18:59.180
The nightmares never stopped.

19:02.933 --> 19:06.062
I just want my daughter back.

19:11.984 --> 19:14.153
Thank you, Mrs. Washington.

19:14.153 --> 19:16.238
No further questions.

19:32.046 --> 19:33.464
<i>Now that the state
has rested their case,</i>

19:33.464 --> 19:35.049
<i>Tyson's attorney,
Vincent Fuller,</i>

19:35.049 --> 19:36.634
<i>more known as a tax attorney
than a criminal litigator,</i>

19:36.634 --> 19:39.261
<i>is gearing up to present
his side of the story.</i>

19:39.261 --> 19:41.347
<i>Early polling data
suggests many,</i>

19:41.347 --> 19:43.641
<i>including 56%
of African Americans,</i>

19:43.641 --> 19:45.142
<i>are on Tyson's side.</i>

19:45.142 --> 19:47.019
<i>This, following
the recent high-profile case</i>

19:47.019 --> 19:48.521
<i>of William Kennedy Smith</i>

19:48.521 --> 19:50.439
<i>who was acquitted
after lurid details</i>

19:50.439 --> 19:51.941
<i>about his accuser's
sex life</i>

19:51.941 --> 19:53.943
<i>were brought into
the courtroom by the defense.</i>

19:53.943 --> 19:55.653
<i>And, of course,
the Clarence Thomas</i>

19:55.653 --> 19:57.321
<i>Supreme Court
confirmation hearings</i>

19:57.321 --> 19:59.865
<i>where Justice Thomas denied
his accuser Anita Hill's</i>

19:59.865 --> 20:02.201
<i>claims of inappropriate
workplace conduct,</i>

20:02.201 --> 20:04.662
<i>saying he was the victim
of a "high tech lynching."</i>

20:06.247 --> 20:09.333
Michael G. Tyson's
reputation preceded him.

20:09.333 --> 20:12.211
There was not a single attendee
at the Black Expo

20:12.211 --> 20:15.881
who was not aware
that Mr. Tyson was a vulgarian,

20:15.881 --> 20:18.759
in thrall to his natural
carnal instincts,

20:18.759 --> 20:21.887
with a voracious appetite
for the fairer sex.

20:21.887 --> 20:23.848
<i>
Natural carnal instincts?</i>

20:23.848 --> 20:26.225
<i>It's like he couldn't
help himself.</i>

20:26.225 --> 20:27.893
<i>I could see the women
in the jury</i>

20:27.893 --> 20:29.437
<i>could see right through it.</i>

20:29.437 --> 20:31.814
Miss Whittington,
can you please walk us through

20:31.814 --> 20:34.191
how you came to be acquainted
with Mr. Tyson?

20:34.191 --> 20:35.693
I was
the Wisconsin representative

20:35.693 --> 20:37.695
in the Miss Black America pageant.

20:37.695 --> 20:39.697
<i>We could all see
what he wanted.</i>

20:39.697 --> 20:42.491
Hey, Catholic school,
you wanna come to my place?

20:42.491 --> 20:44.285
Come party?

20:44.285 --> 20:45.953
I batted him away.

20:45.953 --> 20:47.746
I like Southern girls.

20:47.746 --> 20:50.916
You like to cook,
and I like to eat.

20:50.916 --> 20:52.710
What is she saying?

20:52.710 --> 20:55.588
It was up to me
to bat him away?

20:55.588 --> 20:58.257
And when Miss Washington
discussed Mr. Tyson,

20:58.257 --> 21:00.092
what did she say?

21:00.092 --> 21:02.803
She said
that he's not intelligent,

21:02.803 --> 21:05.097
that he's dumb, ignorant.

21:05.097 --> 21:07.433
Look at the money
Robin Givens got.

21:07.433 --> 21:09.435
Mike doesn't know
how to speak.

21:09.435 --> 21:11.937
He'll make the money,
and I'll do the talking.

21:11.937 --> 21:14.440
Thank you, Ms. Alexander.

21:16.609 --> 21:20.154
The defense calls
Michael G. Tyson.

21:33.792 --> 21:35.669
What happened that night?

21:35.669 --> 21:37.880
I called her.
And she was tired,

21:37.880 --> 21:40.174
so I said, "Don't worry,
just comb your hair,

21:40.174 --> 21:41.842
throw some water
on your face."

21:41.842 --> 21:43.427
Then I asked her
to wear something short,

21:43.427 --> 21:45.888
like a short dress,
or some loose, baggy shorts,

21:45.888 --> 21:47.389
or something like that.

21:47.389 --> 21:50.518
Then she came down to the car,
and we started kissing.

21:50.518 --> 21:52.728
After that, we went around
the corner to my hotel.

21:52.728 --> 21:55.648
We got upstairs.
I sat on the bed.

21:55.648 --> 21:57.691
She was talking.

21:57.691 --> 22:01.403
And we started kissing,
and she started getting hot,

22:01.403 --> 22:04.782
she started undressing,
and we had oral sex.

22:04.782 --> 22:06.951
Eventually,
it graduated to sex.

22:06.951 --> 22:08.994
And afterwards,
I invited her to stay.

22:08.994 --> 22:11.413
But she didn't want to stay.
She wasn't one of those.

22:11.413 --> 22:13.499
And she asked me
to take her downstairs.

22:13.499 --> 22:16.168
And I didn't wanna take her.
I was tired.

22:16.168 --> 22:17.670
I had to get up at 5:00 a.m.
the next morning,

22:17.670 --> 22:19.088
in a couple of hours.

22:19.088 --> 22:20.756
Maybe I should have just
walked her downstairs,

22:20.756 --> 22:22.216
you know, Christ.

22:22.216 --> 22:24.635
She just left irritated
with me after that.

22:27.471 --> 22:29.890
Did she ever say no?

22:29.890 --> 22:31.600
She did not.

22:31.600 --> 22:34.144
I mean, she says she cried,
and she screamed, and all,

22:34.144 --> 22:36.021
but you must understand,

22:36.021 --> 22:37.773
we were in a hotel room
in the middle of the night.

22:37.773 --> 22:39.858
Somebody would've heard her.

22:39.858 --> 22:44.488
So what is your version
of what happened that night?

22:44.488 --> 22:46.365
She was not raped.

22:46.365 --> 22:48.868
Now take us back once again

22:48.868 --> 22:51.537
to when you met
Ms. Washington.

22:51.537 --> 22:56.333
What verbiage did you use
to propose your rendezvous?

22:56.333 --> 22:58.627
How did I ask her out?

22:58.627 --> 23:00.504
Yes, sir.

23:02.464 --> 23:04.383
Well, I said I wanted
to fuck her.

23:06.510 --> 23:08.053
Order!

23:08.053 --> 23:10.639
<i>
Hearing him say those words,</i>

23:10.639 --> 23:12.725
<i>"I wanted to fuck her."</i>

23:12.725 --> 23:16.520
<i>It was like he was
trying to define me.</i>

23:16.520 --> 23:20.065
<i>He was trying
to take every part</i>

23:20.065 --> 23:23.152
<i>away from me of who I was.</i>

23:23.152 --> 23:25.821
<i>I didn't want
to be that girl now.</i>

23:30.284 --> 23:32.828
"I want to fuck you."

23:32.828 --> 23:35.748
The defendant claims
that's what he directly stated

23:35.748 --> 23:38.792
to this 18-year-old
high school honors student.

23:38.792 --> 23:43.756
And she just laughs and says,
"Yeah, sure, give me a call."

23:43.756 --> 23:46.050
That's
the ridiculous fairy tale

23:46.050 --> 23:47.593
the defendant is
asking you to accept.

23:47.593 --> 23:50.304
Witness
after witness attested

23:50.304 --> 23:53.015
to Miss Washington's
clear-eyed goal

23:53.015 --> 23:56.101
to separate a simple man
from his money.

23:56.101 --> 23:58.103
She's given
slightly different versions

23:58.103 --> 24:00.439
of that night
to different people.

24:00.439 --> 24:03.400
She was so desperate
to escape that room,

24:03.400 --> 24:05.694
she didn't even put
her shoes back on.

24:05.694 --> 24:08.280
Ms. Washington
didn't cry out.

24:08.280 --> 24:12.284
In fact, Mr. Tyson
was attentive to her needs.

24:12.284 --> 24:14.370
The only part
of Miss Washington

24:14.370 --> 24:17.873
that was injured that night
was her pride.

24:17.873 --> 24:20.751
She was being treated
like a one-night stand.

24:20.751 --> 24:23.003
She went in there
thinking she was going

24:23.003 --> 24:25.839
to grab the gold ring
and left an embarrassed,

24:25.839 --> 24:29.301
humiliated woman
bent on revenge.

24:29.301 --> 24:32.012
<i>
"Stay the night," Mike said.</i>

24:32.012 --> 24:34.181
Think about that.

24:34.181 --> 24:36.600
If you want
in Mike Tyson's life,

24:36.600 --> 24:38.602
and he makes love to you

24:38.602 --> 24:41.063
and invites you
to sleep with him,

24:41.063 --> 24:42.773
how are you rejected?

24:42.773 --> 24:47.528
If you're the little weasel
who wants Mike Tyson's money,

24:47.528 --> 24:49.863
wants to be
the next Robin Givens,

24:49.863 --> 24:52.116
you've just kicked one
through the goalposts.

24:52.116 --> 24:56.412
There's only one victim here,
and it's not

24:56.412 --> 25:00.582
the multi-millionaire
heavyweight champion.

25:00.582 --> 25:05.587
It's this brave young lady
who had the unmitigated gall

25:05.587 --> 25:08.507
to stand up to a man
with unlimited power

25:08.507 --> 25:10.968
and resources
and tell the truth.

25:14.930 --> 25:17.808
If you believe

25:17.808 --> 25:21.061
this beautiful,

25:21.061 --> 25:26.191
honest kid got deceived
by a professional deceiver,

25:26.191 --> 25:31.613
was lied to, schmoozed,
romanced, isolated,

25:31.613 --> 25:35.117
and raped,

25:35.117 --> 25:39.246
then guilty
must be your judgment.

25:42.166 --> 25:44.918
That's all.

25:52.593 --> 25:55.304
Thank you.

25:56.263 --> 25:58.474
<i>As jury deliberations continue,</i>

25:58.474 --> 26:00.392
<i>Tyson's supporters keep vigil</i>

26:00.392 --> 26:02.519
<i>outside the Indianapolis courthouse.</i>

26:02.519 --> 26:04.271
Somebody
in that hotel would have

26:04.271 --> 26:05.898
heard something
if there had been a rape.

26:05.898 --> 26:07.858
Mike Tyson has done
some bad things,

26:07.858 --> 26:09.401
but he didn't rape nobody.

26:09.401 --> 26:10.778
She raped herself.

26:10.778 --> 26:12.321
I've done a lot of research,

26:12.321 --> 26:14.990
and it's physically impossible
to rape a woman

26:14.990 --> 26:18.619
who isn't, shall we say, ready.

26:18.619 --> 26:21.205
From where I'm standing,
this isn't a crime,

26:21.205 --> 26:24.208
just an unfortunate incident.

26:24.208 --> 26:26.001
You really feel hatred,
you know.

26:26.001 --> 26:28.003
That becomes a part
of you, too.

26:28.003 --> 26:30.714
I don't know yet
if that'll ever go away.

26:30.714 --> 26:33.383
So... you know.

26:38.347 --> 26:42.059
No means no!
We believe Desiree!

26:42.059 --> 26:45.562
No means no!
We believe Desiree!

26:45.562 --> 26:47.856
No means no!

26:47.856 --> 26:51.693
We believe Desiree!
No means no!

26:51.693 --> 26:53.904
We believe Desiree!

26:55.531 --> 26:57.699
We believe Desiree!

26:57.699 --> 27:00.661
The jury's back.

27:07.084 --> 27:10.546
Has the jury reached a verdict?

27:10.546 --> 27:13.090
Yes, we have.

27:24.810 --> 27:28.230
As to count one, rape,

27:28.230 --> 27:31.942
we the jury find the defendant
Michael Tyson...

27:31.942 --> 27:32.943
guilty.

27:34.653 --> 27:38.282
Count 2, guilty.

27:38.282 --> 27:39.324
<i>I did it.</i>

27:39.324 --> 27:41.034
Count three...

27:41.034 --> 27:44.997
<i>I survived it,
just like Mom said I would.</i>

27:44.997 --> 27:48.959
<i>They tried to break me, but...</i>

27:48.959 --> 27:52.129
Now what?

27:52.129 --> 27:54.047
The day after the rape,

27:54.047 --> 27:57.342
you went back to the pageant
and participated.

27:57.342 --> 27:59.887
You danced in it.
How could you do that?

27:59.887 --> 28:01.638
I'm not a quitter.

28:01.638 --> 28:03.140
If I were a quitter,

28:03.140 --> 28:05.183
I would have never gone
through with this trial.

28:05.183 --> 28:08.020
This is what happened.
This is the truth.

28:08.020 --> 28:11.523
What are your feelings
towards Mike Tyson?

28:11.523 --> 28:15.485
I pity him.
That's all I can feel for him.

28:15.485 --> 28:18.488
After he did what he did,
he said to me,

28:18.488 --> 28:20.198
"Don't you love me now?"

28:20.198 --> 28:25.871
And all I could think is,
this man is sick.

28:26.830 --> 28:29.625
If I saw him today,
I would tell him,

28:29.625 --> 28:33.295
"You hurt me real bad.
I didn't do this to hurt you.

28:33.295 --> 28:35.088
"I didn't do this
to take your career away.

28:35.088 --> 28:37.132
"I did this
because you need help,

28:37.132 --> 28:39.551
"and if your so-called friends
aren't big enough

28:39.551 --> 28:41.261
to tell you that, then I will."

28:41.261 --> 28:43.263
You've said
this is the only interview

28:43.263 --> 28:44.681
you're going to do,

28:44.681 --> 28:47.017
but are you going
to write a book?

28:47.017 --> 28:49.561
I have no plans
to write a book.

28:49.561 --> 28:53.065
This is the last time
I will address society.

28:53.065 --> 28:55.442
Desiree was so sweet.

28:55.442 --> 28:57.444
She was voted friendliest
in our school.

28:57.444 --> 28:58.904
No one brings it up.

28:58.904 --> 29:01.073
But everybody knows
what happened to her.

29:01.073 --> 29:03.575
- I heard she changed her name.
- And her face.

29:03.575 --> 29:05.452
But that's just, like,
a total rumor.

29:05.452 --> 29:07.037
And her parents got divorced.

29:07.037 --> 29:08.664
Everyone's parents
get divorced.

29:08.664 --> 29:11.708
But yeah, it was so sad.

29:11.708 --> 29:15.504
Mike wasn't gonna get
no fair trial!

29:15.504 --> 29:19.466
Successful Black man
in a white man's court?

29:19.466 --> 29:21.176
<i>
What Tyson didn't know is,</i>

29:21.176 --> 29:23.428
<i>his words were caught
on a hot mic.</i>

29:23.428 --> 29:25.973
I should've just killed
that slimy bitch.

29:25.973 --> 29:29.893
I should've just
killed that slimy bitch.

29:29.893 --> 29:32.062
<i>That was a response
to an uppity lady reporter</i>

29:32.062 --> 29:33.563
<i>who asked
a ridiculous question.</i>

29:33.563 --> 29:34.815
<i>Nothing to do
with that other woman.</i>

29:34.815 --> 29:36.566
Now, this conviction
was all a plot

29:36.566 --> 29:38.443
by a racist,
corrupt justice system

29:38.443 --> 29:41.780
to imprison the greatest man
America has ever produced...

29:41.780 --> 29:44.616
A true hero.
