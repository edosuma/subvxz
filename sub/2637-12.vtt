00:05.955 --> 00:09.049
Here's the problem with teleportation.

00:11.795 --> 00:13.729
Lay it on me.

00:13.897 --> 00:15.660
Assuming a device could be invented...

00:15.832 --> 00:19.495
...which would identify the state of matter
of an individual in one location...

00:19.669 --> 00:22.502
...and transmit that to a distant location
for reassembly...

00:22.672 --> 00:24.936
...you wouldn't have
transported the individual...

00:25.108 --> 00:30.239
...you would have destroyed him in one
location and re-created him in another.

00:31.314 --> 00:33.441
How about that.

00:34.250 --> 00:35.877
I would never use a transporter.

00:36.052 --> 00:38.714
The original Sheldon
would have to be disintegrated...

00:38.888 --> 00:41.618
...in order to create a new Sheldon.

00:42.092 --> 00:46.153
Would the new Sheldon be in any way
an improvement on the old Sheldon?

00:47.097 --> 00:49.361
No, he would be exactly the same.

00:49.532 --> 00:51.432
That is a problem.

00:51.601 --> 00:52.829
So you see it too?

00:53.803 --> 00:55.930
Dr. Hofstadter, Dr. Cooper.

00:56.106 --> 00:57.300
Dr. Gablehauser.

00:57.474 --> 00:59.840
Gentlemen,
I'd like you to meet Dennis Kim.

01:00.009 --> 01:02.842
Dennis is a highly sought-after
doctoral candidate.

01:03.012 --> 01:05.138
We're hoping to have him
do graduate work here.

01:05.315 --> 01:08.580
- Graduate work, very impressive.
- And he's only 15 years old.

01:08.752 --> 01:12.620
Not bad.
I myself started graduate school at 14.

01:12.789 --> 01:16.281
Well, I lost a year while my family
was tunneling out of North Korea.

01:18.661 --> 01:21.459
Advantage, Kim.

01:21.998 --> 01:24.057
I thought maybe you
could show Dennis around.

01:24.234 --> 01:27.601
Let him see why we're the best
physics research facility in the country.

01:27.771 --> 01:28.795
I know you're not.

01:28.972 --> 01:32.305
You don't have an Open Science Grid
computer or a free electron laser.

01:32.475 --> 01:35.035
The string theory research
being done is a dead end.

01:35.211 --> 01:38.942
Excuse me, that is my research,
and it is by no means a dead end.

01:39.115 --> 01:42.141
Well, obviously, you don't see it yet,
but trust me, you will.

01:44.921 --> 01:46.513
Dennis, we've discussed this.

01:46.689 --> 01:49.055
We're in the process
of updating our equipment.

01:49.225 --> 01:51.386
We welcome your input
on our research goals.

01:51.561 --> 01:54.121
We agree to look the other way
if you use 20 percent...

01:54.297 --> 01:57.664
...of the money you attract to smuggle
your grandfather out of Pyongyang.

01:59.335 --> 02:01.462
We want him here, boys.

02:01.638 --> 02:03.105
- Make it happen.
- Yes, sir.

02:03.273 --> 02:05.138
You can count on us. We're on it.

02:05.308 --> 02:07.572
What the hell do you mean, "dead end"?

02:08.011 --> 02:10.946
I mean, the whole landscape
of false vacuums in string theory...

02:11.114 --> 02:13.446
...could be as large
as 10 to the 500th power.

02:13.616 --> 02:14.640
In addition-

02:14.818 --> 02:16.183
Ooh, look, chocolate milk.

02:19.189 --> 02:22.090
I sense a disturbance in the force.

02:22.258 --> 02:25.557
A bad feeling I have about this. Mm.

02:27.000 --> 02:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:51.054 --> 02:52.817
So how long have you been in America?

02:52.989 --> 02:54.456
- A year and a half.
- No kidding.

02:54.624 --> 02:57.855
- You speak English really well.
- So do you.

02:58.261 --> 03:02.698
Except for your tendency
to end sentences with prepositions.

03:02.966 --> 03:05.230
What are you talking about?

03:06.369 --> 03:08.269
That.

03:08.638 --> 03:09.935
He's not wrong.

03:10.974 --> 03:13.238
All right, and this is my office.

03:13.409 --> 03:15.809
- Is this part of the tour?
- Nope. Goodbye.

03:16.913 --> 03:18.938
Sheldon,
we've hardly shown him anything.

03:19.115 --> 03:22.744
All right, this is my desk.
These are my books.

03:22.919 --> 03:25.683
This is my door.
Please close it behind you, goodbye.

03:27.857 --> 03:30.189
You're doing work
in quantum loop corrections.

03:30.360 --> 03:34.854
- Keen observation, goodbye.
- You see where you went wrong, don't you?

03:35.932 --> 03:37.229
- Leonard.
- Ha.

03:37.400 --> 03:40.198
- Yeah?
- Get him out.

03:40.970 --> 03:44.098
Come, I'll show you the rec center.
They've got Nautilus equipment.

03:44.274 --> 03:46.037
Do I look like I lift weights?

03:47.277 --> 03:49.643
Not heavy ones.

03:49.812 --> 03:53.680
It's startling you haven't considered
a Lorentz invariant or field theory approach.

03:54.617 --> 03:56.209
You think I haven't considered it?

03:56.386 --> 03:59.651
- You really think I haven't considered it?
- Have you considered it?

04:01.357 --> 04:03.450
- Get him out, Leonard.
- Come on, Dennis.

04:03.626 --> 04:06.424
I'll show you the radiation lab.

04:06.763 --> 04:08.856
Wow. You won the Stevenson Award?

04:09.232 --> 04:13.134
Yes. In fact,
I am the youngest person ever to win it.

04:13.503 --> 04:15.630
Really? How old?

04:15.805 --> 04:17.136
Fourteen and a half.

04:17.307 --> 04:19.399
Mm. You were the youngest
ever to win it.

04:23.246 --> 04:25.714
It's like looking
into an obnoxious mirror, isn't it?

04:30.019 --> 04:33.682
Mm. This is really delicious, isn't it?

04:36.759 --> 04:40.058
Still can't talk to me
unless you're drunk, huh?

04:41.030 --> 04:45.194
Oh, sweetie, you are so damaged.

04:46.169 --> 04:48.831
Hey, I'm damaged too.

04:49.005 --> 04:51.371
How about a hug for Howie?

04:51.541 --> 04:54.738
Sure. Raj, hug Howard.

04:58.948 --> 05:00.438
Something you'd like to share?

05:01.517 --> 05:03.883
A tale of woe perhaps?

05:04.387 --> 05:05.718
Fifteen years old.

05:05.888 --> 05:09.722
Dennis Kim is 15 years old
and he's already correcting my work.

05:09.892 --> 05:13.760
Today, I went
from being Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart to...

05:13.930 --> 05:15.363
You know, that other guy.

05:15.531 --> 05:16.623
Antonio Salieri?

05:17.500 --> 05:20.128
Oh, God,
now even you're smarter than me.

05:21.371 --> 05:25.740
You know, you don't have so many friends
that you can afford to start insulting them.

05:26.876 --> 05:28.741
Just eat, Sheldon. You'll feel better.

05:28.911 --> 05:30.139
Why waste food?

05:30.313 --> 05:32.713
When a cow goes dry,
they don't keep feeding it...

05:32.882 --> 05:36.215
...they just take her out
and shoot her between the eyes.

05:36.619 --> 05:40.419
I'm confused.
Did Sheldon stop giving milk?

05:41.157 --> 05:42.886
You can't let this kid get to you.

05:43.059 --> 05:46.495
You knew that someday, someone would
come along who's younger and smarter.

05:46.662 --> 05:49.358
Yes, but I assumed
I would've been dead hundreds of years.

05:49.532 --> 05:53.059
And that there'd be an asterisk
by his name because he'd be a cyborg.

05:54.370 --> 05:57.737
So you got a little competition.
I really don't see what the big deal is.

05:57.907 --> 06:02.037
Of course you don't.
You've never excelled at anything.

06:03.012 --> 06:06.743
I don't understand, exactly how did
he get any friends in the first place?

06:07.583 --> 06:09.847
We liked Leonard.

06:11.587 --> 06:13.350
What are you gonna do, just give up?

06:13.856 --> 06:18.623
Yes, it's what a rational person does
when his entire life's work is invalidated...

06:18.795 --> 06:21.593
...by a postpubescent Asian wunderkind.

06:22.231 --> 06:26.725
He ceases his fruitless efforts,
he donates his body to scientific research...

06:26.903 --> 06:29.428
...and he waits to die.

06:30.606 --> 06:35.475
I'm confused again. Is he waiting, or do
we get to shoot him between the eyes?

06:38.114 --> 06:39.877
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:40.049 --> 06:41.448
I've decided you're right.

06:41.617 --> 06:43.778
- My career is not over.
- Great.

06:43.953 --> 06:46.979
But since Dennis Kim
has rendered my research pointless...

06:47.156 --> 06:49.624
...I just have to find
something else to focus on.

06:49.792 --> 06:50.952
Great.

06:51.127 --> 06:53.721
So I've decided
I'm going to collaborate with you.

06:56.933 --> 06:58.457
Great.

06:58.634 --> 07:00.465
So, what exactly is it you do?

07:01.504 --> 07:05.531
I know you chatter on about it all the time,
but I've never really paid attention.

07:06.275 --> 07:09.472
Right now, I'm designing an experiment
to study the soft component...

07:09.645 --> 07:12.375
...of cosmic radiation at sea level,
but I don't need help.

07:12.548 --> 07:14.573
Oh, sure you do.

07:15.051 --> 07:17.713
Now see, what's this here in the schematic,
a laser array?

07:17.887 --> 07:19.582
- Yes.
- Now, hmm...

07:22.925 --> 07:25.985
What happens if you use argon lasers
instead of helium-neon?

07:26.395 --> 07:28.488
- It would blow up.
- Are you sure?

07:28.998 --> 07:31.489
- Pretty sure.
- "Pretty sure" is not very scientific.

07:31.667 --> 07:35.433
Is this how you normally work?
Just hunches and guesses and stuff?

07:36.339 --> 07:37.465
Okay.

07:37.640 --> 07:40.666
I understand that you're going
through a bit of a career crisis.

07:40.843 --> 07:44.677
You're searching for some other area
where you can feel valuable and productive.

07:44.847 --> 07:47.372
But I need to tell you something,
and listen carefully.

07:47.550 --> 07:50.849
- All right.
- Go away.

07:53.189 --> 07:57.956
If you're concerned about sharing credit
with me, your name can go first- I'm going.

08:01.764 --> 08:04.198
It's a small brown paper bag, Ma.

08:04.367 --> 08:07.302
I'm looking at it right now.

08:07.570 --> 08:12.166
Why would I make that up?
There's no Ding Dong in it.

08:14.043 --> 08:18.207
How are two Ding Dongs tomorrow
gonna help me today?

08:19.649 --> 08:22.743
So this is Engineering, huh?

08:22.919 --> 08:25.046
I'll talk to you later.

08:25.221 --> 08:27.951
Engineering,
where the noble semiskilled laborers...

08:28.124 --> 08:30.991
...execute the vision
of those who think and dream.

08:32.227 --> 08:34.253
Hello, Oompa Loompas of science.

08:36.732 --> 08:38.631
Sheldon, what are you doing here?

08:39.068 --> 08:41.058
I just came by to say hello.

08:41.236 --> 08:43.899
For three years,
you've never come by to say hello.

08:44.073 --> 08:46.564
Well, up until now,
I've had better things to do.

08:47.643 --> 08:49.634
So, what are we making today?

08:49.812 --> 08:54.044
A small payload support structure for
a European science experimental package...

08:54.217 --> 08:57.744
-... that's going up on the next space shuttle.
- Really? How does it work?

08:57.920 --> 09:00.047
It will be attached to the payload bay...

09:00.223 --> 09:03.784
...and the sensor apparatus will rest on it.

09:04.193 --> 09:05.421
Ah-ha.

09:05.895 --> 09:08.363
So it's a shelf.

09:11.400 --> 09:12.560
No, you don't understand.

09:12.735 --> 09:16.000
During acceleration, it needs
to stay perfectly level and provide-

09:16.172 --> 09:17.605
Yeah, okay, it's a shelf.

09:18.341 --> 09:19.865
I notice you're using titanium.

09:20.042 --> 09:22.408
Did you give any consideration
to carbon nanotubes?

09:22.578 --> 09:25.513
They're lighter, cheaper
and have twice the tensile strength.

09:25.681 --> 09:31.278
Sheldon, there's a diploma in my office
that says I have a master's in engineering.

09:31.454 --> 09:35.288
And you also have a note from your mother
that says, "I love you, Bubula. "

09:37.126 --> 09:40.960
But neither of those is a cogent argument
for titanium over nanotubes.

09:41.697 --> 09:42.959
- Sheldon.
- Yes?

09:43.132 --> 09:45.293
Go away.

09:45.901 --> 09:47.459
Did Leonard tell you to say that?

09:48.037 --> 09:49.800
No, I thought of it all by myself.

09:51.440 --> 09:54.841
Huh? Can't be a coincidence.

09:55.011 --> 09:58.469
There must be some causal link
I'm missing.

10:00.716 --> 10:03.844
Go away.

10:11.027 --> 10:14.326
Curiouser and curiouser.

10:18.534 --> 10:22.231
- Is he here?
- If he were, I wouldn't be.

10:22.405 --> 10:24.703
You know what he did?
He watched me work...

10:24.874 --> 10:29.368
...and then started to design a simple piece
of software that could replace me.

10:30.346 --> 10:31.779
Is that even possible?

10:31.947 --> 10:33.812
As it turns out, yes.

10:35.551 --> 10:38.111
- Something's gotta be done about him.
- Like what?

10:38.287 --> 10:41.552
He'll never cope with the fact
that some 15-year-old is smarter...

10:41.724 --> 10:43.419
...and more accomplished than he is.

10:44.160 --> 10:48.187
What if something were to happen to him
so he was no longer a threat to Sheldon?

10:49.732 --> 10:52.200
Then our problem would be solved.

10:52.868 --> 10:55.598
Hang on,
are we talking about murdering Dennis Kim?

10:56.872 --> 10:58.772
I'm not saying no.

10:59.642 --> 11:02.110
We don't have to go that far.
There are other means.

11:02.611 --> 11:05.102
We can't send him back to North Korea.

11:05.281 --> 11:06.509
He knows how to get out.

11:08.984 --> 11:12.351
The only thing we need to do
is make this Kim kid lose his focus.

11:12.521 --> 11:15.388
It won't happen.
He is not interested in anything but physics.

11:15.558 --> 11:17.287
- What about biology?
- What?

11:17.460 --> 11:20.452
You know, biology.

11:20.629 --> 11:23.530
The one thing that can completely derail
a world-class mind.

11:23.699 --> 11:25.758
- Howard, he's 15.
- Yeah, so?

11:25.935 --> 11:27.698
When I was 15, I met Denise Palmeri...

11:27.870 --> 11:31.966
...and my grade point average
fell from a 5.0 to a 1.8.

11:32.141 --> 11:33.403
She was sleeping with you?

11:33.876 --> 11:38.506
No, I just wasted a lot of time thinking
about what it would be like if she did.

11:39.815 --> 11:41.282
Oh, good, you're all here.

11:41.450 --> 11:45.716
I've decided that if the three of you drop
whatever you're working on and join me...

11:45.888 --> 11:50.416
...we could lick cold fusion
in less than a decade, 12 years tops.

11:52.628 --> 11:53.652
Go away?

11:56.098 --> 11:57.326
Hmm.

11:57.867 --> 11:58.891
Could it be me?

12:03.139 --> 12:04.163
Hey, guys, what's up?

12:04.340 --> 12:07.776
We need a hot 15-year-old Asian girl
with a thing for smart guys.

12:08.711 --> 12:10.338
- What?
- Howard, that's racist.

12:10.513 --> 12:14.176
Any 15-year-old girl will do the trick.

12:19.488 --> 12:22.946
It's possible
she may have misunderstood us.

12:28.631 --> 12:31.794
- Dr. Cooper. Oh, are we interrupting?
- No, no, please come in.

12:31.967 --> 12:34.435
I think you'll appreciate this.
This is very exciting.

12:34.603 --> 12:36.798
- What are you working on?
- Something remarkable.

12:36.972 --> 12:41.306
Since my prospects for the Nobel Prize
in Physics have disappeared- Thank you.

12:41.477 --> 12:44.913
- I've decided to refocus my efforts
and use my people skills...

12:45.080 --> 12:46.570
...to win the Nobel Peace Prize.

12:46.749 --> 12:49.217
Look, I'm going
to solve the Middle East crisis...

12:49.385 --> 12:54.220
...by building an exact replica of Jerusalem
in the middle of the Mexican desert.

12:54.857 --> 12:55.881
To what end?

12:56.058 --> 13:00.461
You know, it's like the baseball movie.
"Build it and they will come. "

13:01.230 --> 13:02.254
Who will come?

13:02.431 --> 13:04.296
The Jewish people.

13:04.467 --> 13:05.729
What if they don't come?

13:05.901 --> 13:07.732
We'll make it nice, put out a spread.

13:09.238 --> 13:11.103
Okay, well, speaking of spreads...

13:11.273 --> 13:14.174
...we're having a welcoming party
this afternoon for Mr. Kim...

13:14.343 --> 13:18.245
-... who's agreed to join us at the university.
- Of course he has.

13:18.414 --> 13:22.441
The oracle told us little Neo was the one.

13:23.686 --> 13:25.278
You can see the matrix, can't you?

13:25.454 --> 13:30.221
Okay, well, obviously, you're very busy
with your, ah, um...

13:30.392 --> 13:31.416
Come, Dennis.

13:33.395 --> 13:37.161
You'll have to excuse Dr. Cooper.
He's been under a lot of, um...

13:37.333 --> 13:39.494
He's nuts.

13:45.508 --> 13:49.205
They'll come, they'll settle
And I'll win the prize

13:50.946 --> 13:53.642
I don't understand your objections,
Professor Goldfarb.

13:53.816 --> 13:57.445
Why wouldn't the Sonora Desert
make a perfectly good Promised Land?

13:58.220 --> 13:59.710
Go away.

14:00.990 --> 14:03.686
We could call it Nuevo Jerusalem.

14:04.527 --> 14:06.017
Please go away.

14:07.129 --> 14:09.290
Said Pharaoh to Moses.

14:10.533 --> 14:12.524
Why are all these young women here?

14:12.701 --> 14:14.532
It's Take Your Daughter to Work Day.

14:15.070 --> 14:16.628
Really? I was not aware of that.

14:16.805 --> 14:19.103
Oh, yes.
There was a very official e-mail...

14:19.275 --> 14:21.869
...that was sent to everyone
whose files indicated...

14:22.044 --> 14:24.877
...they had daughters
between the ages of 14 and 16.

14:25.214 --> 14:26.238
Hmm.

14:26.415 --> 14:28.474
- Smooth.
- Thank you.

14:29.818 --> 14:32.787
There's the man of the hour.

14:33.355 --> 14:37.792
So we have a socially awkward genius in
a room of attractive age-appropriate women.

14:37.960 --> 14:39.689
All he has to do is hook up with one.

14:48.671 --> 14:52.004
Anyone else see the flaw in this plan?

14:52.508 --> 14:53.907
We need a social catalyst.

14:54.076 --> 14:57.978
Like what?
We can't get 15-year-old girls drunk.

14:58.147 --> 15:00.081
- Or can we?
- No, we can't.

15:01.150 --> 15:04.119
I don't think you mean we can't.
I think you mean we shouldn't.

15:04.286 --> 15:06.948
Hey, Howard, you're a Jew.

15:07.122 --> 15:10.353
If there was another Wailing Wall
exactly like the one in Jerusalem...

15:10.526 --> 15:13.222
...but close to taco stands
and cheap prescription drugs...

15:13.395 --> 15:15.056
...would you still wail at it?

15:17.199 --> 15:19.463
Okay, it's definitely me.

15:21.670 --> 15:24.138
We cannot leave this to chance.
Let's pick a girl...

15:24.306 --> 15:26.536
...and figure out
how to get her with Dennis.

15:27.509 --> 15:28.533
How about that one?

15:29.912 --> 15:33.439
Uh-uh. I know the type. Cheerleader,
student council, goes out with jocks.

15:33.616 --> 15:35.777
Won't look at anybody
in the gifted program.

15:35.951 --> 15:38.681
If she does agree to go out,
it turns out to be a setup.

15:38.854 --> 15:42.722
You're in your mom's car with your pants off
while the whole football team laughs.

15:46.261 --> 15:49.719
- Are you crying?
- No, I have allergies.

15:50.766 --> 15:52.063
Okay. Uh...

15:52.234 --> 15:54.259
Oh, hey, how about her?

15:54.970 --> 15:57.666
Sure, if he wants to spend years
doing her homework...

15:57.840 --> 16:01.071
...while she drinks herself into a stupor
with nonfat White Russians.

16:01.243 --> 16:03.643
And you're holding her head
while she's puking...

16:03.812 --> 16:06.007
...and wishes
more guys were like you.

16:06.181 --> 16:08.547
She gets into Cornell,
because you wrote her essay.

16:08.717 --> 16:12.915
And you drive up to visit her one weekend
and she acts like she doesn't know you.

16:15.491 --> 16:17.254
Okay, so not her either.

16:18.927 --> 16:20.292
How about her?

16:20.462 --> 16:24.330
Interesting, kind of pretty, a little chubby,
so probably low self-esteem.

16:24.500 --> 16:25.592
I think that's our girl.

16:25.768 --> 16:27.360
One of us should go talk to her.

16:27.536 --> 16:29.333
I can't talk to her, you do it.

16:29.505 --> 16:31.473
I can't just go up and talk to her.

16:31.640 --> 16:32.800
Howard, you talk to her.

16:33.676 --> 16:37.339
I don't know, she'll never go for the kid
once she gets a peek at this.

16:39.515 --> 16:41.107
In India, this would be simpler.

16:41.283 --> 16:44.480
Five minutes with her dad, 20 goats
and a laptop, and we'd be done.

16:45.120 --> 16:46.348
Well, we're not in India.

16:46.522 --> 16:48.285
Why don't we do it your way, then?

16:48.457 --> 16:53.827
We'll arrange for her to move in across the
hall so he can pathetically moon over her.

16:55.764 --> 16:58.096
- Okay, that was uncalled for.
- You started it, dude.

16:59.635 --> 17:01.796
Could I have everyone's attention,
please?

17:02.538 --> 17:05.837
What a wonderful occasion this is.

17:06.008 --> 17:09.375
And how fortunate that it should
fall on Take Your Daughter to Work Day.

17:10.813 --> 17:14.874
We're here to welcome Mr. Dennis Kim
to our little family.

17:15.050 --> 17:17.314
Welcome, Dennis Kim.

17:18.252 --> 17:22.121
Mr. Kim was not only the valedictorian
at Stanford University...

17:22.290 --> 17:27.593
...he is also the youngest recipient
of the prestigious Stevenson Award.

17:27.762 --> 17:30.163
Youngest till the cyborgs rise up.

17:30.999 --> 17:32.933
And now, without any further ado...

17:33.102 --> 17:38.734
...let me introduce the man of the hour,
Mr. Dennis Kim.

17:39.842 --> 17:42.777
Dennis? Dennis.

17:42.945 --> 17:45.106
What?

17:45.881 --> 17:48.577
Would you like to tell us
about your upcoming research?

17:48.751 --> 17:51.948
Oh, no, thanks.
I'm going to the mall with Emma.

17:57.126 --> 17:59.594
The kid got a girl.

17:59.995 --> 18:01.724
Unbelievable.

18:01.897 --> 18:05.389
Did anyone see how he did it?

18:06.135 --> 18:07.568
Don't worry, I've got this.

18:07.736 --> 18:11.695
Ladies and gentlemen,
honored daughters...

18:11.874 --> 18:15.037
...while Mr. Kim,
by virtue of his youth and naiveté...

18:15.210 --> 18:18.509
...has fallen prey to the inexplicable need
for human contact...

18:18.680 --> 18:22.480
...let me step in and assure you
that my research will go on uninterrupted.

18:22.651 --> 18:27.782
And that social relationships
will continue to baffle and repulse me.

18:28.423 --> 18:29.549
Thank you.

18:32.427 --> 18:34.554
- He's back.
- Yeah, mission accomplished.

18:34.730 --> 18:37.961
Forget the mission. How did that
little yutz get a girl on his own?

18:38.700 --> 18:40.895
I guess times have changed
since we were young.

18:41.069 --> 18:43.162
Smart is the new sexy.

18:43.972 --> 18:46.941
Then why do we go home alone
every night? We're still smart.

18:47.409 --> 18:49.001
Maybe we're too smart.

18:49.178 --> 18:50.975
So smart, it's off-putting.

18:52.314 --> 18:54.805
Yeah, let's go with that.
