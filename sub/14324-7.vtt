20:41.323 --> 20:41.949
WHAT'S UP WITH THAT?

20:41.323 --> 20:41.949
{\an1}HEY!

20:42.032 --> 20:44.785
{\an1}JUST, YOU KNOW,
NOT AS MUCH.

20:44.868 --> 20:46.161
{\an1}I MEAN,
SANTA BRINGS US TOYS,

20:46.244 --> 20:48.830
{\an1}AND CHRISTMAS BRINGS
OUR FAMILIES TOGETHER.

20:48.914 --> 20:50.290
BIRTHDAY BOY'S
GOT A POINT.

20:50.374 --> 20:53.126
{\an5}ALL I DO IS LEAVE
EGGS THAT GO BAD
IF YOU DON'T FIND THEM.

20:53.210 --> 20:57.464
{\an4}AND ALL I DO IS GET KIDS
TO PLAY HORRIBLE PRANKS
ON ONE ANOTHER.

20:57.547 --> 21:01.510
{\an4}YEAH, BUT I MAKE KIDS
FALL IN LOVE
WITH EACH OTHER.

21:01.593 --> 21:03.595
Kids: EWW!

21:03.679 --> 21:04.846
POINT TAKEN.

21:04.930 --> 21:08.684
{\an4}WE'RE SORRY, SANTA.
WE WERE BOTH STUPID
AND JEALOUS.

21:15.983 --> 21:18.944
Kids: YAY, SANTA!

21:19.027 --> 21:20.529
{\an1}CAN YOU EVER
FORGIVE US, SANTA?

21:20.612 --> 21:22.072
I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO FORGIVE YOU.

21:22.155 --> 21:24.616
{\an5}TOMORROW'S CHRISTMAS
AGAIN, AND AS LONG
AS IT'S STILL CHRISTMAS,

21:24.700 --> 21:27.369
I HAVE TO GIVE THE KIDS
WHAT THEY WISHED FOR.

21:27.452 --> 21:28.578
THAT'S IT!
THAT'S HOW WE FIX THIS!

21:28.662 --> 21:31.456
DO YOU KNOW WHY IT WILL BE
CHRISTMAS AGAIN TOMORROW?

21:31.540 --> 21:37.045
{\an4}BECAUSE WE KEEP TELLING SANTA
WE WANT SOME TOY OR DOLL
OR SOME STUPID THING,

21:37.129 --> 21:38.046
AND CHRISTMAS DAY,

21:38.130 --> 21:40.048
{\an1}SANTA GRANTS OUR WISHES,
WHATEVER THEY MAY BE.

21:40.132 --> 21:43.593
{\an5}BUT IF EVERY KID IN THE WORLD
WISHED FOR IT TO BE THE DAY
AFTER CHRISTMAS,

21:43.677 --> 21:46.638
THAT'S WHAT SANTA
WOULD HAVE TO BRING TO US--

21:46.722 --> 21:47.597
DECEMBER 26!

21:47.681 --> 21:49.516
{\an1}QUICK! EVERYONE
WRITE SANTA A LETTER!
