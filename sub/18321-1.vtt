They are what they are.

Cannot be changed.

00:18.085 --> 00:21.553
Scrooge turned
to look at the ghost.

00:21.589 --> 00:23.622
He could see..

00:23.657 --> 00:25.391
...that they were parts
of all of the faces

00:25.426 --> 00:27.793
that had shown him
from his past.

00:27.828 --> 00:30.929
Spirit, remove me.

00:30.965 --> 00:32.564
I cannot bear it.

00:34.602 --> 00:39.138
Soon, Scrooge was conscious
of being exhausted and..

00:39.173 --> 00:42.574
(Eve on PA)
'And overcome
by an irresistible drowsiness'

00:42.610 --> 00:44.810
'and further of being back
in to his own bedroom.'

00:47.615 --> 00:49.915
'He barely had time to reel
to his bed before he sank'

00:49.950 --> 00:52.618
'into a heavy sleep.'

00:55.122 --> 00:58.824
Awaking later to the sound
of his clock as it struck 1:00.

00:58.859 --> 01:00.437
(Eve and Miranda)
Scrooge could see
a ghostly light

01:00.461 --> 01:02.327
from the adjoining room.

01:03.898 --> 01:06.198
'He got up softly'

01:06.233 --> 01:07.733
'and shuffled to the door.'

01:10.371 --> 01:14.273
Peeping around the door,
he heard a blooming voice.

01:14.308 --> 01:17.276
I am the Ghost Of Christmas
Present.

01:17.311 --> 01:19.845
(Miranda)

first thing in the morning,
we'll have the units staged

01:45.739 --> 01:47.017

01:47.041 --> 01:50.242
People will be standing
in line to sign a lease.

01:50.277 --> 01:51.510
Great, great.

01:51.545 --> 01:52.589
I'll have my assistant e-mail

01:52.613 --> 01:53.712
over the contract.

01:53.747 --> 01:55.681
No, thank you.

01:57.184 --> 01:58.428

a truck standing by

01:59.653 --> 02:00.686
Where is he going?

02:00.721 --> 02:02.054
Garber's new building on Fifth.

02:02.089 --> 02:03.055
I just closed the deal to stage

02:03.090 --> 02:04.623
all three condo floor plans.

02:04.658 --> 02:06.002
I thought he already
turned us down.

02:06.026 --> 02:09.294
Annie, what's the first rule
of staging any new home?

02:09.330 --> 02:11.597
Let the potential buyer
see themself in the home.

02:11.632 --> 02:13.543
Which is why I told Garber
we will put a Christmas tree

02:13.567 --> 02:14.833
in all the model units.

02:14.869 --> 02:16.079
Nothing says
welcome to your new home

02:16.103 --> 02:17.936
like that fresh holiday smell.

02:17.972 --> 02:19.905
[chuckles]
Nice.

02:19.940 --> 02:22.285
Oh, could you ask Mr. Turner
if we can push back that meeting

02:22.309 --> 02:23.408
by a few hours?

02:23.444 --> 02:25.277
The folks from Portland
are in town

02:25.312 --> 02:26.590
and I told them
we could have lunch.

02:26.614 --> 02:28.358
Speaking of Mr. Turner,
he wanted me to remind you

02:28.382 --> 02:29.948
about his Christmas party
on Saturday.

02:29.984 --> 02:32.050
- Is that this Saturday?
- Well, yeah.

02:32.086 --> 02:35.187
I mean, with Christmas only
a week away and all.

02:35.222 --> 02:38.257
Um, tell him
I will let him know.

02:38.292 --> 02:41.793
The Sandlers called again about
Christmas dinner at their house.

02:41.829 --> 02:44.897
I will let them know.

02:44.932 --> 02:46.331
Your building super
wants to know

02:46.367 --> 02:48.233
what you're gonna bring
to the holiday potluck

02:48.269 --> 02:50.002
this year.

02:50.037 --> 02:51.570
You'll let him know. Right?

02:51.605 --> 02:53.438
Hey, I will let them know.

02:53.474 --> 02:56.808
I just, I have a lot
on my plate right now.

02:56.844 --> 02:59.077
It's Christmas, Miranda.

02:59.113 --> 03:00.879
Y-you're supposed to celebrate.

03:00.915 --> 03:04.583
Give thanks, exchange gifts, eat
too much, wear ugly sweaters.

03:04.618 --> 03:07.352
Annie, I appreciate
what you're trying to say

03:07.388 --> 03:09.621
but I have work to do.

03:09.657 --> 03:11.034
Speaking of which,
are there any messages

03:11.058 --> 03:13.258
that aren't about Christmas?

03:13.294 --> 03:17.095
Um, a guy named
Rick Torrance called.

03:17.131 --> 03:19.409
He said it was important and
wants to talk to you right away.

03:19.433 --> 03:21.711
Doesn't ring a bell. If he calls
back, find out what he wants?

03:21.735 --> 03:22.801
Will do.

so distracted, they can
barely stay in their seats.

03:36.283 --> 03:37.416
Not that I can blame them.

03:37.451 --> 03:39.184
- It's almost Christmas.
- Yeah?

03:39.220 --> 03:41.453
Thank goodness, there's only
one more day to the break.

03:41.488 --> 03:42.966
Though, I'm not exactly
looking forward

03:42.990 --> 03:44.089
to flying for the holidays.

03:44.124 --> 03:45.057
No, you'll have a good time

03:45.092 --> 03:47.326

03:47.361 --> 03:48.727
What about you?

03:48.762 --> 03:50.229
Any plans this year?

03:50.264 --> 03:52.197
Um, yeah, yeah.

03:52.233 --> 03:55.400
Um, I'll-I'll probably
just catch up on work.

03:55.436 --> 03:57.369
You mean, like last year.

03:57.404 --> 03:58.904
And the year before that.

03:58.939 --> 04:00.806
Okay, why is everyone

04:00.841 --> 04:03.208
suddenly so concerned
with my Christmas plans?

04:03.244 --> 04:06.144
Because, my dear,
we care about you.

04:06.180 --> 04:09.314
Being alone for Christmas
is hard for anyone.

04:09.350 --> 04:11.416
But for you..

04:11.452 --> 04:13.185
...I can't imagine
how it must feel.

04:16.724 --> 04:19.291
I don't know
what's wrong with me, Blair.

04:19.326 --> 04:20.625
I mean, it's been 20 years.

04:20.661 --> 04:22.628
She was your mother.

04:22.663 --> 04:24.096
You lost her at Christmas.

04:24.131 --> 04:26.665
Yeah, but she loved
being an actress

04:26.700 --> 04:28.667
and to go that way,
on-on the stage

04:28.702 --> 04:32.671
performing "A Christmas Carol,"
she's probably still smiling.

04:32.706 --> 04:34.506
That doesn't make it
any easier for you.

04:35.643 --> 04:37.943
No.

04:37.978 --> 04:40.846
But I am not
a little girl anymore.

04:40.881 --> 04:43.615
I have stability,
I'm not wandering in the country

04:43.651 --> 04:45.117

04:46.854 --> 04:50.022
But it's the same thing
every year.

the lights, the smell.

[sighs]

04:57.231 --> 04:58.897
It just reminds me that

04:58.932 --> 04:59.976
maybe she would have eventually

05:00.000 --> 05:00.966
told me who my father was

05:01.001 --> 05:03.402
but she never got the chance.

05:03.437 --> 05:04.836
She must have had her reasons.

- Yeah.
- I remember you too.

She played Miranda.

why hide the program?

have to do with Shakespeare

about anything.

12:49.870 --> 12:51.736

14:27.234 --> 14:28.466
Uh, just visiting.

14:28.501 --> 14:30.301
Well, you picked
the perfect time of the year.

14:30.337 --> 14:32.003
Oh, yeah, it's beautiful.

14:32.038 --> 14:33.771
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

14:33.807 --> 14:34.906
My name is Katherine.

14:34.941 --> 14:36.641
I am the owner of the inn

14:36.676 --> 14:38.142
along with my husband, Andrew.

14:38.178 --> 14:40.089
If you need anything,
please don't hesitate to ask.

14:40.113 --> 14:41.179
Thank you.

14:41.214 --> 14:42.180
How about a nice cup

14:42.215 --> 14:43.681
of tea after your long trip?

14:43.717 --> 14:44.983
You can cozy up by the fire.

14:45.018 --> 14:45.950
Um, there's actually something

14:45.986 --> 14:47.552
I wanted to see in town first.

14:47.587 --> 14:50.288
- Could I take a rain check?
- Anytime you like.

14:50.323 --> 14:51.601
And your room is at the top
of the stairs.

14:51.625 --> 14:52.991
- Thanks.
- Enjoy your stay.

14:53.026 --> 14:54.425
Thank you.

15:03.837 --> 15:05.970
Come on.

15:06.006 --> 15:07.305
Come on.

15:10.076 --> 15:11.676
Need some help?

15:11.711 --> 15:14.045
Yeah, my GPS isn't working.

15:16.149 --> 15:18.950
Uh, cell service
is a bit spotty up here.

15:18.985 --> 15:20.518
'Where you headed?'

15:20.553 --> 15:23.454
Um, I need to find
an address in town.

15:23.490 --> 15:26.824
- It's 2625 Bexley Lane.
- Oh, that's no problem.

15:26.860 --> 15:28.326
It's three blocks down that way.

15:28.361 --> 15:30.962
You'll run into the old church.
That's Bexley Lane.

15:30.997 --> 15:34.232
Then hang a left, go another
two blocks and you'll be there.

15:34.267 --> 15:36.000
- Thanks.
- Yeah, my pleasure.

15:37.504 --> 15:39.804
- You work at the inn?
- Yeah.

15:39.839 --> 15:42.240
I just checked in.
It's really nice.

15:42.275 --> 15:44.575
- Miranda.
- Ian.

15:44.611 --> 15:46.044
- Ah.
- Nice to meet you.

15:46.079 --> 15:47.412
- That looks heavy.
- Little bit.

15:47.447 --> 15:49.280
Sorry.

15:49.316 --> 15:51.382
- Maybe, I'll see you around?
- Yeah.

15:51.418 --> 15:53.551
- Three blocks?
- Yeah, you can't miss it.

15:53.586 --> 15:54.953
Thanks. Again.

we make them right here.

- No, I'm fine. Thank you.

17:26.780 --> 17:29.213
We know Carlton Heath
as well as anyone.

17:29.249 --> 17:31.983
Yeah, it-it's really
not important.

17:32.018 --> 17:33.496
You come all the way
across the country

the week before Christmas
all alone to a place

17:36.222 --> 17:39.624
you've never been before
to find something.

17:39.659 --> 17:41.926
I have a feeling it must be
very important.

17:41.961 --> 17:45.096
[chuckles]
Only to me.

17:45.131 --> 17:46.342
I'm pretty sure
now that I'm here

17:46.366 --> 17:49.000
it would just sound silly
to anyone else.

17:49.035 --> 17:50.802
Though it never hurts to try.

17:53.106 --> 17:55.940
Alright, um, ahem..

17:55.975 --> 17:56.908
Have you ever heard

17:56.943 --> 17:59.343
of the Carlton Heath
Photography Studio?

17:59.379 --> 18:01.679
Yep. On Bexley Lane.

18:01.714 --> 18:04.248
It was run by the
Halverson family for years.

18:04.284 --> 18:05.349
But it's closed now.

18:05.385 --> 18:06.818
Right, but, um, do you know

18:06.853 --> 18:10.321
where they are?
The, the family who ran it?

18:10.356 --> 18:12.924
The kids grew up
and moved away years ago.

18:12.959 --> 18:17.361
Jane and Eric, they retired
to Arizona, I think.

18:17.397 --> 18:18.663
Are you a friend of the family?

18:18.698 --> 18:19.864
No, um..

18:21.601 --> 18:23.067
This was taken at their studio.

18:25.071 --> 18:28.473
[laughs]
What a cutie.

18:28.508 --> 18:30.475
Who are they?

18:30.510 --> 18:33.077
Um, that's why I came.

18:33.113 --> 18:34.879
To find out.

18:34.914 --> 18:37.048
You came all this way
because of a photograph

18:37.083 --> 18:38.516
of someone you don't know?

18:38.551 --> 18:40.485
Told you it would sound silly.

18:40.520 --> 18:42.186
Well, where'd you get this?

18:42.222 --> 18:45.123
My mother, um,
it was important to her

18:45.158 --> 18:47.225
and I wanted to find out why.

18:47.260 --> 18:49.193
You couldn't just ask her?

18:49.229 --> 18:50.628
I never got the chance.

18:52.365 --> 18:55.166
That doesn't sound silly at all.

18:55.201 --> 18:57.268
Well, doesn't matter anyway.

18:57.303 --> 19:00.404
The studio's closed, and I'm
sure they threw everything away.

19:02.208 --> 19:03.908
There is something
familiar about it.

19:03.943 --> 19:05.309
- Really?
- Yeah.

19:05.345 --> 19:07.578
Maybe it's just the way
Santa's dressed.

19:07.614 --> 19:09.313
We called him Father Christmas
back then.

19:09.349 --> 19:10.593
It was an old tradition
around here

19:10.617 --> 19:12.850
from when the English
settled the village.

19:12.886 --> 19:15.753
But you've never actually
seen that photo, have you?

19:18.057 --> 19:19.335
You know who you should talk to?

19:19.359 --> 19:20.958
Andrew, my husband.

19:20.994 --> 19:22.860
At the very least
he maybe able to tell you

19:22.896 --> 19:25.029
where the Halversons retired to.

19:25.064 --> 19:26.497
Do you think he'd mind?

19:26.533 --> 19:28.533
[chuckles]
Not at all.

19:28.568 --> 19:29.934
But he's still in town

19:29.969 --> 19:32.770
and I have to keep an eye
on things around here.

19:33.940 --> 19:35.039
I'll get my son.

19:35.074 --> 19:37.008
He'd be happy
to show you the way.

your parents owned the inn.'

'No, you asked if
I worked there, which I do.'

19:55.762 --> 19:57.028
Chopping wood?

19:57.063 --> 19:58.496
I also shovel snow

19:58.531 --> 20:00.865

20:00.900 --> 20:03.301

I make a pretty decent maid.

last part to impress you.

- This town is so beautiful.
- Yeah, I love it here.

20:13.079 --> 20:16.380

always knew I'd come back home.

No family, just me.

20:27.493 --> 20:30.661

and a lot of questions.

20:30.697 --> 20:32.230
Well..

...hopefully, we can help you
find the answers.

still existed.

20:41.774 --> 20:43.808
It gets better, come on.

20:46.145 --> 20:47.712
When this was built,
it was the first

20:47.747 --> 20:49.513
brick church in New England.

20:49.549 --> 20:51.415
Before the Revolution,
the locals met here

20:51.451 --> 20:53.217
to plot against the British.

20:53.253 --> 20:54.619
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

20:54.654 --> 20:56.387
Legend has it that
one Christmas Eve

20:56.422 --> 20:57.733
the British surrounded
the church to try

20:57.757 --> 20:59.857
and catch them
during the service.

20:59.892 --> 21:03.261
But when they went inside,
there was no one to be found.

21:03.296 --> 21:04.562
What?

21:04.597 --> 21:05.563
They didn't know that
there was secret passageway

21:05.598 --> 21:06.964
that led from under the church

21:07.000 --> 21:08.799
and into the woods.

21:08.835 --> 21:10.079
But some say
that on Christmas Eve

21:10.103 --> 21:12.069
if you listen closely enough

21:12.105 --> 21:15.406
you can hear them singing
from under the church.

21:15.441 --> 21:17.808
- Get out of town.
- No, it's true.

21:17.844 --> 21:18.854

that I've ever heard

21:18.878 --> 21:19.989

21:20.013 --> 21:21.445
Oh, of course not.

21:21.481 --> 21:23.381

and legends.

about 30 years ago.

was a Christmas play.

for the renovation.

the theatre after him.

Right now,
we should get back to the inn

25:22.722 --> 25:24.588

25:45.444 --> 25:46.777
Alright, Katherine, off we go.

25:46.812 --> 25:47.845
Oh, before you go.

25:47.880 --> 25:48.846
Ellie, um, I'd like

25:48.881 --> 25:50.381
to introduce you, Miranda.

25:50.416 --> 25:52.816
Uh, this is Miranda Chester,
she's visiting our little town

25:52.852 --> 25:54.018
for the first time ever.

25:54.053 --> 25:56.186
Welcome to Carlton Heath.
I'm Ellie Whitcomb.

25:56.222 --> 25:58.556
This is my daughter, Julia
and my son, Mark.

25:58.591 --> 26:00.524
It's very nice to meet you.

26:00.560 --> 26:03.093
We had hot chocolate with
a candy cane to stir it with.

26:03.129 --> 26:05.229
- Oh, that sounds delicious.
- 'It is.'

26:05.264 --> 26:06.275
We have it every Christmas

26:06.299 --> 26:08.799
before we go shopping
for presents.

26:08.834 --> 26:10.901
A little
Whitcomb family tradition.

26:10.937 --> 26:13.871
Whitcomb? I saw a plaque
at the theatre yesterday.

26:13.906 --> 26:15.773
Are you related
to James Whitcomb?

26:15.808 --> 26:16.985
Yeah, that's
my husband's father.

26:17.009 --> 26:18.375
Mm-hmm, wonderful man.

26:18.411 --> 26:20.088
We wouldn't have a theatre
if it wasn't for him.

26:20.112 --> 26:22.246
Oh, speaking of which,
I hope you plan on attending

26:22.281 --> 26:23.559
the Christmas show
while you're here.

26:23.583 --> 26:25.516
I'm not sure
how long I can stay.

26:25.551 --> 26:27.351
Aww! That's a shame.

26:27.386 --> 26:29.620
Well, you must come to
the tree lighting tonight then.

26:29.655 --> 26:32.957
- Oh, yeah!
- Yes, you should.

26:32.992 --> 26:35.893
Yeah, we have a fire and we sing
carols, it's a lot of fun.

26:35.928 --> 26:39.730
And a certain someone makes
a special appearance every year.

26:39.765 --> 26:42.666
She means Santa Claus.

26:42.702 --> 26:44.868
Yes, she does. Well, I hope
we see you tonight.

26:44.904 --> 26:45.914

to meet you, Miranda.

27:14.533 --> 27:15.833
I have a question.

27:15.868 --> 27:18.035
Is there somewhere in town
I can get internet?

27:18.070 --> 27:19.370
Library or something.

27:19.405 --> 27:21.939
Well, you could use my office.

27:21.974 --> 27:23.507

- Uh-huh!

27:25.478 --> 27:26.744

- Yeah.

27:30.950 --> 27:32.483

most of the day

as long as you want.

discreetly in the corner?

27:52.772 --> 27:54.905
Oh, those..

27:54.940 --> 27:59.510
- Yeah, I'm also a lawyer.
- Excuse me?

27:59.545 --> 28:02.613
I mean, I have my degree
and passed the bar.

28:02.648 --> 28:04.693
I even practiced for a couple
of years in Burlington.

28:04.717 --> 28:06.350
But not any more?

28:06.385 --> 28:08.619

tort in a pinch.

with estates.

reading contracts

28:12.558 --> 28:16.093

Those are the best.

a bit about your quest.

29:02.675 --> 29:04.108

No. No, he doesn't
look familiar.

Katherine thought you might know
how to reach the Halversons.

sends some Christmas cards.

35:55.120 --> 35:57.487
who made their living
on the stage.

35:57.523 --> 36:00.257
- Really?
- Yeah, um..

36:00.292 --> 36:02.726
I didn't know

36:02.761 --> 36:05.262

You'll get used to it.

36:05.297 --> 36:06.763
- Y-your father?
- My mother.

36:08.467 --> 36:09.799
Tell me,
what was it like for you

36:09.835 --> 36:12.702
growing up in the shadow
of the theater lights.

36:12.738 --> 36:16.139
- Uh, it was different.
- Yes, it was.

36:18.410 --> 36:20.277
I should help Ellie.

36:20.312 --> 36:22.646
- Uh, enjoy your visit.
- Thank you. Thanks.

36:22.681 --> 36:24.181
- Bye.
- Bye.

36:29.154 --> 36:31.755
Miranda. Hey.

36:31.790 --> 36:34.524
Um, listen,
my parents and I, um..

36:34.560 --> 36:36.237
...we're going caroling
with a bunch of friends

36:36.261 --> 36:38.206
and then we're heading over
to Peter and Ellie's afterwards

36:38.230 --> 36:39.529
to celebrate.

36:39.565 --> 36:41.464
We just thought we'd invite you

36:41.500 --> 36:43.366
if you're up for it.

36:43.402 --> 36:46.937
Oh, that's really sweet, Ian,
but I don't wanna impose.

36:46.972 --> 36:48.605
No, you wouldn't be imposing.

36:48.640 --> 36:50.674
Besides, I have a feeling
that caroling is another

36:50.709 --> 36:52.787
one of those things that you
might have missed out on.

36:52.811 --> 36:54.811
[chuckles]

36:54.846 --> 36:57.714
There's just one

I always wanted to have
a house with a fireplace

37:29.181 --> 37:31.348
so I could hang a stocking
by the chimney with care.

37:33.518 --> 37:36.386

do that every Christmas.

Yeah, he sure does.

But he tends to overdo it.

Oh, no, no, no.
He's not gonna let us do that.

Oh, Ellie, you have
such a beautiful home.

39:18.023 --> 39:20.824
Aw, thank you, love.
This is Peter's family home.

39:20.859 --> 39:22.826
- He grew up here.
- Oh.

39:22.861 --> 39:25.428
Well, I love the way
you've decorated it.

- No.

I just, um,
you hardly said a word

40:28.760 --> 40:32.429
on the way back, so I-I wanted
to make sure you're okay.

40:32.464 --> 40:34.531
Yeah, I think I'm just
a little tired, that's all.

40:35.700 --> 40:37.500
Look, if you need anything..

40:37.536 --> 40:40.069
- If you need to talk or...
- I'm fine.

40:41.907 --> 40:44.974
- Okay. Um, goodnight then.
- Goodnight.

40:46.211 --> 40:47.343
Ian.

40:50.649 --> 40:53.817
Earlier today, Ellie Whitcomb
mentioned my mother..

40:53.852 --> 40:55.952
...about her being an actress.

40:55.987 --> 40:58.555
And you're the only one
I told about that.

40:59.157 --> 41:01.458
Oh, um..

41:01.493 --> 41:04.027
...yeah, I-i-it just kinda
came up.

41:04.062 --> 41:06.062
Should I not have said anything?

41:06.998 --> 41:08.565
[sighs]

41:08.600 --> 41:11.067
I met her husband, Peter,
and we talked about

41:11.102 --> 41:12.669
both having actors
in the family

41:12.704 --> 41:15.772
and he didn't seem
too happy about it.

41:15.807 --> 41:19.542
Yeah, well, his father was away
a lot while he was growing up.

41:19.578 --> 41:21.611
Doing shows and all that.

41:21.646 --> 41:23.847
I'm sure that was tough
on Peter.

41:23.882 --> 41:25.315
Yeah.

41:25.350 --> 41:28.551
Maybe that's why he's always
stayed so close to his family.

41:28.587 --> 41:31.387
Because he missed his father
so much.

41:36.595 --> 41:38.795
- Thanks for checking on me.
- Sure.

41:40.899 --> 41:42.499
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

41:52.177 --> 41:54.344
Good morning. Hi.

41:54.379 --> 41:57.814
- Oh, good morning.
- Mm. Morning.

41:57.849 --> 42:00.049
I wanted to let you know

42:00.085 --> 42:02.952
I may have a lead
on that photograph of yours.

42:02.988 --> 42:04.354
- Really?
- 'Yes.'

42:04.389 --> 42:06.256
I was speaking with
Ben Hailey this morning

42:06.291 --> 42:07.557
he's the pharmacist.

42:07.592 --> 42:09.559
He got a call
a few months ago

42:09.594 --> 42:11.661
from a pharmacy in Tucson.

42:11.696 --> 42:14.464
Now, they were inquiring
about a prescription refill

42:14.499 --> 42:16.232
for Eric Halverson.

42:16.268 --> 42:18.535
He's the fellow that owns
the photo studio.

42:18.570 --> 42:21.070
Turns out, he and his wife,
Jane, are still there.

42:21.106 --> 42:24.741
And, uh, Ben gave me his
e-mail address... somewhere..

42:24.776 --> 42:26.576
Ah! Here it is.

42:26.611 --> 42:29.178
And I thought if you wanted
to get in touch with him

42:29.214 --> 42:31.648
'they might be able to help.'

42:31.683 --> 42:33.750
If you still want to, that is.

42:35.487 --> 42:37.287
That is why I'm here.

42:37.322 --> 42:39.389
Well, I'm off to learn my lines!

42:39.424 --> 42:41.024
Only two more days
until the show

42:41.059 --> 42:43.760
and my mind has been
such a sieve lately.

42:43.795 --> 42:45.628
- Thank you, Andrew.
- You're welcome.

43:00.378 --> 43:02.011
[drill whirring]

43:10.422 --> 43:12.956

Hi! What are you doing here?

43:14.993 --> 43:17.827
Uh, I'm workin' on the set
before rehearsal starts.

43:17.862 --> 43:20.229
After last night, I wanted
to give my dad a break.

43:20.265 --> 43:22.832
You know, I saw him this
morning. He really seemed fine.

43:22.867 --> 43:24.812
Yeah, well, the way he looks
forward to the show every year

43:24.836 --> 43:26.480
he wouldn't let a little
thing like exhaustion

43:26.504 --> 43:28.538
keep him from that stage.

43:28.573 --> 43:29.817
He's been playin'
this role ever since

43:29.841 --> 43:31.608
James Whitcomb passed away.

43:32.777 --> 43:34.577
Wish I could have met him.

43:34.613 --> 43:36.312
Yeah, well,
stick around for Christmas.

43:36.348 --> 43:37.313
You can meet Margaret.

43:37.349 --> 43:39.782
- Margaret?
- Yes, his wife.

43:39.818 --> 43:41.417
She comes back
for the holidays.

43:41.453 --> 43:43.353
They were married
almost 40 years.

43:43.388 --> 43:45.054
Forty years, wow.

43:45.090 --> 43:47.557
I'm sure she has
lots of stories to tell.

43:47.592 --> 43:49.092
Come on, check out the set.

43:49.127 --> 43:52.428
Um, actually, I have to go home.

43:53.698 --> 43:56.132
But I thought that you..

43:56.167 --> 44:00.236
Oh, okay, well,
I-I'm sorry to hear that.

44:00.271 --> 44:02.472
Um, I-I guess you won't
get to see the show then.

44:03.608 --> 44:04.641
No.

44:07.445 --> 44:09.178
I gotta go, I'm sorry.

44:10.148 --> 44:12.615
It's the theater.

44:12.651 --> 44:15.284
For someone whose mother
was an actress..

44:15.320 --> 44:17.587
...you sure get very nervous
inside a theater.

44:22.427 --> 44:25.028
I have stayed away from theaters
since I was nine years old.

44:26.931 --> 44:27.931
Why?

44:34.906 --> 44:37.073
I was in her dressing room
just like every other night.

44:38.843 --> 44:42.345
And I couldn't understand
why she just... stopped.

44:45.350 --> 44:47.684
She was gone before
I made it to the stage.

44:48.987 --> 44:50.219
I'm sorry.

44:52.590 --> 44:54.791
I didn't have any other family
and nowhere to go.

44:56.327 --> 44:58.428
If it wasn't for
a friend of my mother's

44:58.463 --> 45:00.296
I don't know
what I would have done.

45:00.331 --> 45:01.931
Then what about your father?

45:03.935 --> 45:06.469
She never told me
who my father was.

45:07.939 --> 45:10.640
And I have spent
my whole life wondering.

45:13.078 --> 45:16.145
I used to walk down the street
and wonder, "Is that him?"

45:17.515 --> 45:19.482
"Is that my father?"
"Is that him?"

45:22.253 --> 45:24.654
Um, then, a few days ago..

45:25.523 --> 45:26.856
...I found this.

45:29.928 --> 45:31.761
This is the picture
mom told me about?

45:31.796 --> 45:32.796
Mm.

45:34.733 --> 45:35.976
'Yeah, my mother kept it hidden'

45:36.000 --> 45:39.569
and I came here
to find out why.

45:39.604 --> 45:42.105
And you think he lived in
Carlton Heath because of this.

45:43.475 --> 45:45.508
Uh-huh, and..

45:46.878 --> 45:47.878
'...this.'

45:49.547 --> 45:51.414
It belonged to my mother.

45:53.384 --> 45:56.519
- That's our Christmas Angel.
- What?

45:56.554 --> 45:58.621
It's kind of an old tradition
around here.

45:58.656 --> 46:00.156
You give it to someone
you care about

46:00.191 --> 46:02.625
to let them know that
they're always in your thoughts.

46:07.699 --> 46:10.700
Um, I also found this.

46:13.071 --> 46:15.404
- 'My mother played Miranda.'
- 'Hmm.'

46:15.440 --> 46:17.473
That's how she picked my name.

46:17.509 --> 46:18.875
And when I found it

46:18.910 --> 46:23.079
I just assumed
that was why she kept it.

46:23.114 --> 46:26.649
- What, there's another reason?
- Mm-hmm.

46:26.684 --> 46:27.962
After I got here,
I realized that

46:27.986 --> 46:30.186
the dates of the performances..

46:31.990 --> 46:33.656
...they're nine months
before I was born.

46:36.528 --> 46:37.805
That's why I asked
to use your computer.

46:37.829 --> 46:41.197
I wanted to look up the names.

46:41.232 --> 46:43.699
You think your father had
somethin' to do with the show.

46:43.735 --> 46:44.801
I do.

46:46.437 --> 46:48.371
Only now I'm afraid
of the answer.

46:49.474 --> 46:50.740
Why is that?

46:52.777 --> 46:55.411
Last night at the Whitcombs,
I saw that photo.

46:57.081 --> 46:59.148
And I have to ask..

47:00.285 --> 47:01.350
"Is that him?"

47:03.188 --> 47:04.854
"Is James Whitcomb my father?"

47:06.825 --> 47:10.126
- James..
- I know, it..

47:10.161 --> 47:11.661
His name isn't anywhere
in the program

47:11.696 --> 47:13.040
and he doesn't seem
to have had anything to do

47:13.064 --> 47:14.764
with the production, but..

47:14.799 --> 47:18.167
"Special thanks for the support
of the Gray Hall Theater."

47:18.203 --> 47:20.770
Yeah, I saw that, I've never
heard of the Gray Hall Theater.

47:22.073 --> 47:23.873
You're sitting in it.

47:25.510 --> 47:29.612
The name was changed
to the James Whitcomb Theater.

47:35.153 --> 47:36.485
He was there.

47:38.156 --> 47:40.289
They met..

47:40.325 --> 47:41.390
[door opens]

47:42.594 --> 47:45.161
Um, I..

47:45.196 --> 47:47.096
I have to go.

47:47.131 --> 47:49.866
- Miranda..
- This isn't your problem.

47:49.901 --> 47:51.133
- Let me help you.
- You can't.

47:51.169 --> 47:52.802
- I can try.
- Please..

47:52.837 --> 47:54.470
Just stop feeling sorry for me.

47:54.505 --> 47:57.640
I know I never
have to feel sorry for you.

47:57.675 --> 47:59.876
You came all this way
to find the truth.

47:59.911 --> 48:02.178
Takes a very strong person
to do that.

48:02.213 --> 48:04.313
Then why don't I know
what to do?

48:08.720 --> 48:10.286
You will.

48:12.824 --> 48:14.724
Wait for me... at the end.

48:23.434 --> 48:25.001
Miranda!

48:25.036 --> 48:26.369
Oh, Julia, hi!

48:26.404 --> 48:28.638
- Well, hello, Miranda.
- Hello.

48:28.673 --> 48:29.939
We've come for rehearsal.

48:29.974 --> 48:32.508
And the show's tomorrow.
Christmas Eve.

48:32.543 --> 48:34.143
I didn't know
you were in the show.

48:34.178 --> 48:36.312
Mark's in it too.
He even has lines.

48:36.347 --> 48:38.014
Yeah, I play young Scrooge
in scenes

48:38.049 --> 48:40.116
with the ghost
of Christmas past.

48:40.151 --> 48:41.884
And then,
the next day is Christmas.

48:41.920 --> 48:43.719
How exciting.

48:43.755 --> 48:46.322
You two should get a move on.
You're going to be late!

48:46.357 --> 48:47.357
- Bye.
- Bye!

48:47.392 --> 48:50.159
- Bye, Miranda! Bye!
- Have fun.

48:50.194 --> 48:52.061
I hope you enjoyed
the party last night.

48:52.096 --> 48:53.596
Very much.

48:53.631 --> 48:55.376
Yeah, I couldn't help noticing,
but you seemed interested

48:55.400 --> 48:57.333
in one of
the family photographs.

48:57.368 --> 49:00.336
Oh, yes, um, it was the one
with the little boy

49:00.371 --> 49:04.307
on Father Christmas' lap.
He had such a sweet smile.

49:04.342 --> 49:08.277
You couldn't tell by looking,
but that little boy was me.

49:08.313 --> 49:11.547
And behind that beard
was my father, James.

49:12.517 --> 49:13.849
Your father?

49:13.885 --> 49:16.096
With all of his traveling,
Christmas, it was the one time

49:16.120 --> 49:18.521
that I knew I would be with him.

49:18.556 --> 49:20.756
Well, you must've looked forward
to that time very much.

49:20.792 --> 49:23.125
Well, as I'm sure,
you know, life as an actor

49:23.161 --> 49:25.261
puts a lot of strain
on a family.

49:25.296 --> 49:27.964
Yeah, I treasured those times
when everyone was happiest.

49:27.999 --> 49:30.366
It made Christmas very special.

49:32.804 --> 49:35.338
Well, it's a lovely photograph.

49:35.373 --> 49:36.739
I have to go.

49:43.581 --> 49:45.448
(Ian)
'Whoa! Whoa!'

49:48.086 --> 49:49.552
'Whoa! Whoa!'

49:50.989 --> 49:53.089
Hey! What do you think?

49:53.124 --> 49:54.991
Um, what?

49:55.026 --> 49:56.726
Well, say hello to Prancer.

49:57.395 --> 49:58.928
Hi, Prancer.

49:58.963 --> 50:00.341
'And, yes, in case
you were wondering'

50:00.365 --> 50:03.366
this is what
they wrote the song about.

50:03.401 --> 50:05.568
A one horse open sleigh?

50:05.603 --> 50:08.204
Mm-hmm.
With one minor adjustment.

50:08.239 --> 50:10.740
Wheels. Much more practical.

50:10.775 --> 50:12.708
- Of course.
- Come on up.

50:12.744 --> 50:13.976
I had to borrow him from Santa

50:14.012 --> 50:16.345
so we have to have him back
in a couple of hours.

50:16.381 --> 50:19.382
- Where are we going?
- Where ever you like.

50:19.417 --> 50:20.716
- Thanks.
- Here we go. Mm-hmm.

50:20.752 --> 50:23.552
- I also have hand warmers.
- Okay.

50:23.588 --> 50:26.889
And a thermos
full of hot chocolate.

50:26.924 --> 50:29.058
And best of all..

50:30.161 --> 50:32.561
...a hat, with ear flaps

50:32.597 --> 50:35.197
guaranteed to keep your head
nice and toasty warm

50:35.233 --> 50:37.800
while you look
utterly ridiculous.

50:37.835 --> 50:39.301
Yeah, no.

50:39.337 --> 50:41.270
I guess so.
It can be optional.

50:43.674 --> 50:45.041
Step up!

50:52.183 --> 50:55.251
- Another Christmas first?
- Definitely.

50:55.286 --> 50:57.620
- Ho-ho-ho!
- What?

51:05.763 --> 51:07.696
Easy. Easy.

51:07.732 --> 51:08.831
Easy.

51:11.269 --> 51:14.203
I am beginning to understand
why you never wanted to leave.

51:14.238 --> 51:16.105
Wait until you see
the next heavy snowfall.

51:16.140 --> 51:17.540
I'd like that.

51:19.377 --> 51:21.977
You can.

51:22.013 --> 51:25.314
I don't belong here, Ian,
not the way you do.

51:25.349 --> 51:27.016
It's a tricky thing, belonging.

51:27.051 --> 51:28.951
Tricky? Huh?
What does that mean?

51:28.986 --> 51:30.986
Well, take me for example.

51:31.022 --> 51:32.188
After I finished law school

51:32.223 --> 51:34.290
'I had job offers coming in
from all over.'

51:34.325 --> 51:36.358
New York, Los Angeles,
you name it.

51:36.394 --> 51:37.893
Some of them
were pretty good too.

51:37.929 --> 51:38.994
I'm sure they were.

51:39.030 --> 51:40.563
When I told them
that I was happy here

51:40.598 --> 51:43.699
they assumed that it was because
this was were I grew up.

51:43.734 --> 51:47.269
- 'Cause it was so comfortable.
- It's true though, isn't it?

51:47.305 --> 51:50.239
Yeah, but there's
something else too.

51:50.274 --> 51:51.941
It just feels right.

51:51.976 --> 51:56.312
And when you find that,
that connection in your heart

51:56.347 --> 51:58.114
why would you want to go
anywhere else?

51:58.149 --> 52:00.116
How do you know
when you find it?

52:01.285 --> 52:02.551
You just do.

52:15.900 --> 52:17.633
Whoa! Whoa!

52:19.971 --> 52:20.971
[sighs]

52:22.874 --> 52:25.307
It's beautiful.

52:25.343 --> 52:28.177
Yeah, I've been coming up here
since I was a boy.

52:28.212 --> 52:29.490
I always felt like
I could see things

52:29.514 --> 52:32.281
more clearly from up here.

52:32.316 --> 52:34.116
'It's a good place to think.'

52:40.258 --> 52:42.858
I made up my mind, Ian.

52:42.894 --> 52:44.393
I have to go.

52:44.428 --> 52:45.394
But you still don't even know...

52:45.429 --> 52:47.963
I saw Peter
at the theater earlier.

52:47.999 --> 52:49.698
And he told me.

52:49.734 --> 52:51.967
He's the little boy
in the photo.

52:52.003 --> 52:54.303
And he's sitting on James' lap.

52:54.338 --> 52:57.573
Father Christmas is his father.
My father.

52:58.876 --> 52:59.876
You're sure?

52:59.911 --> 53:02.511
There really isn't
any other explanation.

53:02.547 --> 53:04.914
I mean, they had
to have met during that play.

53:04.949 --> 53:07.650
Who else could have given her
the bracelet?

53:07.685 --> 53:09.763
And then when it was time for
James to go back to his family

53:09.787 --> 53:11.431
my mother wanted something
to remember him by

53:11.455 --> 53:13.255
and so she took the picture.

53:14.959 --> 53:18.561
Okay, even if you're right..

53:18.596 --> 53:20.362
...even if that is the truth

53:20.398 --> 53:22.498
it-it still doesn't mean
you have to go.

53:22.533 --> 53:25.501
Ian, if I stay

53:25.536 --> 53:29.071
and they find out
the real reason I'm here..

53:29.106 --> 53:31.207
...nothing would ever
be the same for that family.

53:33.311 --> 53:37.012
Everything that James
ever was or did

53:37.048 --> 53:40.049
everything he meant to them
all these years..

53:41.619 --> 53:43.619
...they would question.

53:43.654 --> 53:45.621
Doubt..

53:45.656 --> 53:46.822
...and lose.

53:49.860 --> 53:51.505
Whatever happened
between my mother and James

53:51.529 --> 53:53.862
I know now she was right
to keep it a secret.

53:56.634 --> 53:58.634
Even if it means never being
a part of that family.

54:01.072 --> 54:02.938
It's better than hurting
so many good people.

54:06.210 --> 54:09.178
Okay.

54:09.213 --> 54:12.648
- So we don't say anything.
- Ian..

54:12.683 --> 54:14.350
No, what about
what's right for you?

54:16.287 --> 54:18.721
You said so yourself
you don't have anyone in Seattle

54:18.756 --> 54:20.756
to have Christmas with.

54:22.093 --> 54:23.093
So..

54:24.895 --> 54:26.629
...have Christmas with us.

54:28.266 --> 54:29.398
With me.

54:44.148 --> 54:47.316
I have wanted to do that since
the first time I saw you.

55:02.366 --> 55:05.768
I made reservations to fly out
of Boston tomorrow morning.

55:07.705 --> 55:10.873
I'm leaving, Ian. I-I have to.

55:26.324 --> 55:28.257
[horse neighs]

55:28.292 --> 55:31.293
Well, um, I'll drive the cart
back to the stable

55:31.329 --> 55:34.096
and get Prancer bedded down.

55:34.131 --> 55:36.398
I think I'm gonna take a walk.

55:36.434 --> 55:38.334
See the town one more time
before I go.

55:38.369 --> 55:40.936
Really? It's, it's pretty cold.

55:42.106 --> 55:43.706
Guess I'm getting used to it.

55:43.741 --> 55:46.809
[cell phone ringing]
Yeah. Uh, excuse me.

55:51.582 --> 55:53.449
Hello?

55:53.484 --> 55:55.884
Peter?

55:55.920 --> 55:57.853
What? What happened?

55:59.757 --> 56:00.889
I'll be right there.

56:02.293 --> 56:05.194
Is everything alright, Ian?

56:05.229 --> 56:06.762
It's my father.

56:06.797 --> 56:08.530
They rushed him to the hospital.

56:15.373 --> 56:16.483
(Dr. Colter)
'Mrs. McKendrick?'

56:16.507 --> 56:18.173
- Yes?
- I'm Dr. Colter.

56:18.209 --> 56:19.675
Andrew is resting comfortably.

56:19.710 --> 56:21.443
He's tired,
but he's gonna be just fine.

56:21.479 --> 56:23.345
Oh, thank goodness.

56:23.381 --> 56:24.446
What happened, doctor?

56:24.482 --> 56:26.115
We've been running some
preliminary tests

56:26.150 --> 56:27.483
and it appears that Andrew

56:27.518 --> 56:28.784
had a mild heart attack.

56:28.819 --> 56:30.352
What exactly does mild mean?

56:30.388 --> 56:31.820
His ECG didn't show any signs

56:31.856 --> 56:33.288
of permanent damage
to his heart.

56:33.324 --> 56:36.358
- Oh, thank God.
- But this is a warning.

56:36.394 --> 56:38.605
Andrew's in good shape, but
we need to take a closer look

56:38.629 --> 56:39.828
at his diet and his schedule

56:39.864 --> 56:41.241
to make sure
this doesn't happen again.

56:41.265 --> 56:43.065
Okay. Absolutely. Of course.

56:43.100 --> 56:45.000
Right now,
what he needs most is rest.

56:45.035 --> 56:46.902
I'd like to keep him overnight
for observation

56:46.937 --> 56:48.871
and then, for the next
couple of weeks

56:48.906 --> 56:50.973
he's gonna have
to slow things down.

56:51.008 --> 56:53.842
- Take things very easy.
- Okay.

57:00.751 --> 57:03.118
- Hey.
- Hey.

57:03.154 --> 57:05.687
What are the two of you
looking so glum about?

57:05.723 --> 57:07.100
I just got a little dizzy,
that's all.

57:07.124 --> 57:09.458
No, that's not what
the doctor said.

57:09.493 --> 57:11.927
Oh, what does he know?

57:11.962 --> 57:13.295
There's nothing wrong with me

57:13.330 --> 57:15.264
that a good night's sleep
wouldn't cure.

57:17.001 --> 57:19.301
I-I told them,
I need to get out of here.

57:19.336 --> 57:20.302
We've got that show
tomorrow night.

57:20.337 --> 57:22.070
Andrew, no.

57:22.106 --> 57:25.007
That is absolutely not possible.

57:25.042 --> 57:26.308
What are you talking about?

57:26.343 --> 57:28.777
You've been overdoing it
for weeks, dad.

57:28.813 --> 57:31.013
You need to rest up.
Take better care of yourself.

57:31.048 --> 57:33.282
Those are the doctors orders.

57:33.317 --> 57:36.018
Oh, what about the show?

57:36.053 --> 57:38.020
Can't do "A Christmas Carol"
without Scrooge.

57:38.055 --> 57:39.266
And I can't imagine
getting through

57:39.290 --> 57:41.190
one single day without you.

57:41.225 --> 57:43.158
[instrumental music]

57:49.433 --> 57:51.767
Thirty years.

57:51.802 --> 57:53.268
We've never missed
a performance.

57:55.105 --> 57:58.140
Just won't seem like Christmas
around here without it.

57:58.175 --> 58:00.542
Well, it's a small
sacrifice for us

58:00.578 --> 58:02.911
to make sure that Scrooge
is back to do the show

58:02.947 --> 58:05.380
for many more years.

58:05.416 --> 58:07.349
[music continues]

58:12.423 --> 58:16.658
As long as Andrew's gonna be
okay, that's all it matters.

58:16.694 --> 58:18.494
Well, but he's so disappointed.

58:18.529 --> 58:19.895
He didn't wanna let
everybody down.

58:19.930 --> 58:21.597
Not after all these years.

58:21.632 --> 58:23.298
Well, can we do the show anyway?

58:23.334 --> 58:24.833
I-I don't see how, Ellie.

58:24.869 --> 58:27.369
I mean,
all the lines and the blocking.

58:27.404 --> 58:29.705
It's too much for someone
to learn in one day.

58:29.740 --> 58:31.306
I'm afraid Katherine's right.

58:32.676 --> 58:34.176
We have to cancel.

58:35.779 --> 58:38.080
But there must be something
we can do.

58:38.115 --> 58:41.750
I mean, Peter, the show meant
too much to your father.

58:41.785 --> 58:43.151
It's too important.

58:43.187 --> 58:44.887
We don't have a choice, Miranda.

58:47.658 --> 58:48.891
Sorry.

58:52.630 --> 58:55.230
I'm stayin' at the hospital
with dad tonight.

58:55.266 --> 58:57.432
Gonna give mom a rest.

58:57.468 --> 59:00.435
I have an early flight, so I
probably won't see you again.

59:02.573 --> 59:05.107
No.

59:05.142 --> 59:07.209
- So..
- Yeah.

59:08.379 --> 59:10.979
[instrumental music]

59:11.015 --> 59:14.016
Thank you for everything.

59:15.686 --> 59:17.185
Take care, Miranda.

59:20.124 --> 59:21.890
If you're ever
in the northwest..

59:23.327 --> 59:24.860
Sure.

59:26.497 --> 59:27.529
Bye.

59:29.700 --> 59:31.633
[instrumental music]

59:44.148 --> 59:45.280
[music continues]

01:00:35.799 --> 01:00:37.466
Looks like they were right.

01:00:38.669 --> 01:00:39.968
We're havin' a white Christmas.

01:00:43.874 --> 01:00:45.507
I've never seen anything
like it before.

01:00:47.611 --> 01:00:49.211
Yeah, feels like home.

01:00:54.551 --> 01:00:57.419
Shouldn't you be
with your dad?

01:00:57.454 --> 01:01:00.322
Uh, my mom went to the hospital
first thing this morning.

01:01:00.357 --> 01:01:02.658
She's with him now.

Please say goodbye for me.

- Ian..

Look, you've told me
all the reasons

01:01:18.042 --> 01:01:20.709
why you should leave.

01:01:20.744 --> 01:01:22.904
But you're ignoring the one
reason why you should stay.

01:01:25.416 --> 01:01:28.150
You've had to be strong
your entire life..

01:01:28.185 --> 01:01:29.484
...with no one to depend on.

01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:30.719

But coming here to find
the answer to who you are..

...that has to be the hardest
thing you've ever done.

01:01:42.066 --> 01:01:43.565
But if you leave now..

01:01:45.002 --> 01:01:46.568
...nothing changes.

01:01:46.603 --> 01:01:50.972
Yeah, but I didn't come here
to change anything, Ian.

01:01:51.008 --> 01:01:53.208
I came here to see if this might
be a place where...

01:01:53.243 --> 01:01:54.543
A place where you could belong.

01:01:56.413 --> 01:01:57.779

call home.

let them.

the exact same way.

right now.

get on that plane.

But you have to promise
me something.

01:03:12.856 --> 01:03:15.557
Can you promise me you won't say
anything to anyone?

01:03:17.094 --> 01:03:19.761
'Cause no one can know
why I came here.

01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:24.800

that I would play Scrooge.

Hello, Ian.
How is your father?

- He's better, thank you.
- Oh, I'm so glad.

Hmm... and here you are.

Ian told me about your husband.

About how the theater
was named after him.

01:05:09.339 --> 01:05:11.273
You must be very proud.

a lot of memories for me.

Which is why I come every
Christmas, not just to see

a cast party back at the house.

of a Christmas Eve tradition.

Well, um,
I hope you're hungry.

01:11:59.649 --> 01:12:01.260
There's gonna be enough food
to feed an army.

01:12:01.284 --> 01:12:03.451
I need to ask you something.

01:12:03.486 --> 01:12:05.053
What's wrong?

01:12:05.088 --> 01:12:08.823
Last night, did you tell
Margaret about me?

01:12:08.858 --> 01:12:10.658
- About the photograph?
- What?

01:12:10.694 --> 01:12:13.795
No. No, of course not.

01:12:13.830 --> 01:12:15.930
I told you, you could trust me.

01:12:15.965 --> 01:12:17.365
I saw you talking to her

01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:19.967
and she was holding it,
so I just thought...

01:12:20.003 --> 01:12:23.738
It's Christmas, Miranda.
It a picture of her husband.

01:12:23.773 --> 01:12:25.606
She still misses him
very, very much.

01:12:28.244 --> 01:12:29.544
Sorry.

01:12:31.281 --> 01:12:32.681
Just when I was talking
to her later

01:12:32.716 --> 01:12:36.584
the way she looked at me,
just... felt like she..

01:12:38.121 --> 01:12:41.122
...knew something about me.

01:12:42.792 --> 01:12:44.292
Maybe I, I shouldn't go.

01:12:45.962 --> 01:12:47.295
Like, I really
don't belong there.

01:12:52.102 --> 01:12:54.535
I wasn't sure when I was
gonna give this to you.

01:12:56.139 --> 01:12:57.872
Now seems like a good time.

01:12:57.907 --> 01:12:59.273
What?

01:12:59.309 --> 01:13:00.608
[chuckles]
Open it.

01:13:06.149 --> 01:13:07.382
Oh.

01:13:09.018 --> 01:13:10.418
Ian..

01:13:10.453 --> 01:13:13.521
That's your very own
Christmas Angel

01:13:13.556 --> 01:13:18.426
to remind you, no one else
can tell you where you belong.

01:13:18.461 --> 01:13:20.828
It's what you feel in your heart
that guides you hope.

01:13:29.939 --> 01:13:32.140
Merry Christmas.

01:13:32.175 --> 01:13:33.508
It's beautiful. Thank you.

01:13:48.358 --> 01:13:50.057
- Ready?
- Mm-hmm.

01:13:56.332 --> 01:13:58.099
Oh, where are we going?

01:13:58.134 --> 01:13:59.934
Come see. It's a surprise.

01:13:59.969 --> 01:14:01.089
- What is it?
- It's for you.

01:14:03.173 --> 01:14:05.673
Oh, Julia.

01:14:05.708 --> 01:14:07.575
It's beautiful, thank you.

01:14:07.610 --> 01:14:08.876
Don't thank me.

01:14:08.912 --> 01:14:11.546
- It was Santa.
- Of course.

01:14:11.581 --> 01:14:13.225
I will be sure to thank him
the next time I see him.

01:14:13.249 --> 01:14:14.215
[giggling]

01:14:14.250 --> 01:14:16.417
Well, come on.

01:14:16.453 --> 01:14:17.563
Don't you want to see
what he brought you?

01:14:17.587 --> 01:14:19.053
Yes, I do. Thank you.

01:14:20.957 --> 01:14:22.990
(Katherine)
'Uh-oh, posture.'

01:14:23.026 --> 01:14:25.860
You know, Andrew,
I think Ian may have stolen

01:14:25.895 --> 01:14:27.528
some of your thunder
in this year's show.

01:14:27.564 --> 01:14:31.098
Well, he's always been
a bit of a ham.

01:14:31.134 --> 01:14:32.211
And I wonder where
he gets that from?

01:14:32.235 --> 01:14:33.801
Oh..

01:14:33.837 --> 01:14:35.203
Let me say, for the record

01:14:35.238 --> 01:14:36.537
that I am perfectly willing

01:14:36.573 --> 01:14:38.539
to pass the dramatic torch

01:14:38.575 --> 01:14:39.907
to the next generation.

01:14:39.943 --> 01:14:41.053
Oh, no, no, no.
No, you don't.

01:14:41.077 --> 01:14:42.610
I am not going
through that again.

01:14:42.645 --> 01:14:43.711
- Oh, what?
- 'What?'

01:14:43.746 --> 01:14:46.347
Oh, no, but you were
so wonderful.

01:14:46.382 --> 01:14:49.383
- Oh, no offence, Andrew.
- None taken.

01:14:49.419 --> 01:14:51.452
Now, Miranda,
I'm sure you've never seen

01:14:51.488 --> 01:14:54.422
"A Christmas Carol" quite like
ours back in Seattle, have you?

01:14:54.457 --> 01:14:56.657
I don't think anyone has.

01:14:56.693 --> 01:14:58.826
- Oh. Oh!
- Oh! Ow!

01:14:58.862 --> 01:15:00.539
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn't mean it like that.

01:15:00.563 --> 01:15:02.163
'No, I really enjoyed it.'

01:15:02.198 --> 01:15:05.299
I-I can't remember the last time
I've had this much fun.

01:15:05.335 --> 01:15:09.170
This whole trip,
you all have been so generous

01:15:09.205 --> 01:15:10.538
'welcoming me into your home'

01:15:10.573 --> 01:15:13.040
and you've really
reminded me that Christmas

01:15:13.076 --> 01:15:15.343
can be very special.

01:15:15.378 --> 01:15:16.911
So, thank you.
All of you.

01:15:18.748 --> 01:15:20.381
It's a lovely bracelet, Miranda.

01:15:20.416 --> 01:15:23.251
I see that you've discovered
our town's Christmas Angel.

01:15:24.954 --> 01:15:26.621
Ian gave it to me.

01:15:26.656 --> 01:15:27.656
- Hmm..
- Oh!

01:15:27.690 --> 01:15:30.124
- 'Ian.'
- Oh.

01:15:30.159 --> 01:15:32.360
[Andrew giggling]

01:15:32.395 --> 01:15:34.462
Tell me, were you
born in Seattle?

01:15:34.497 --> 01:15:37.765
Um, no, mm-hmm,
I was born in California

01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:39.044
but we moved to Seattle
when I was very young.

01:15:39.068 --> 01:15:40.668
How come?

01:15:40.703 --> 01:15:42.370
Well, my mother got a job there.

01:15:42.405 --> 01:15:44.038
What kind of job?

01:15:44.073 --> 01:15:45.306
She was an actress.

01:15:45.341 --> 01:15:46.908
Like my grandfather?

01:15:46.943 --> 01:15:48.009
'That's right.'

01:15:48.044 --> 01:15:50.511
What about your dad?

01:15:50.547 --> 01:15:53.247
Good heavens,
where is my head?

01:15:53.283 --> 01:15:55.149
Do you know that
I have another present

01:15:55.184 --> 01:15:56.184
for you two upstairs?

01:15:56.219 --> 01:15:57.919
- 'I completely forgot.'
- Really?

01:15:57.954 --> 01:16:00.621
Mm-hmm, so why don't you two run
upstairs?

01:16:00.657 --> 01:16:02.557
They're on my bed.
You can open them up there.

01:16:02.592 --> 01:16:05.159
- Thanks, grandmother.
- Thank you.

01:16:05.194 --> 01:16:06.260
Beautiful kids.

01:16:06.296 --> 01:16:08.696
Was your mother a stage actress?

01:16:08.731 --> 01:16:10.231
Mm-hmm, yes.

01:16:10.266 --> 01:16:11.432
And what was her name?

01:16:13.703 --> 01:16:15.303
Eve, Eve Chester.

01:16:16.539 --> 01:16:17.905
Eve?

01:16:23.146 --> 01:16:24.946
"Whoever in this failed heart."

01:16:30.587 --> 01:16:33.454
You know, I should, um..

01:16:33.489 --> 01:16:36.824
- I-I really think I need to...
- And your father?

01:16:36.859 --> 01:16:38.559
[instrumental music]

01:16:50.673 --> 01:16:52.173
My father was also an actor.

01:16:53.943 --> 01:16:56.644
And his name was James Whitcomb.

01:17:04.087 --> 01:17:06.354
My mother never told me
who my father was.

01:17:06.389 --> 01:17:09.590
And my whole life,
I never knew his name.

01:17:09.626 --> 01:17:11.737
And then, a couple of days ago,
I found this photograph

01:17:11.761 --> 01:17:14.261
and all it said
was Carlton Heath, and..

01:17:14.297 --> 01:17:19.033
And that's why I'm here
to, to find out...

01:17:19.068 --> 01:17:21.369
- Stop.
- Peter, I can show it to you.

01:17:21.404 --> 01:17:23.304
It's the same one
that you have here.

01:17:23.339 --> 01:17:25.139
And when you told me that,
that was him

01:17:25.174 --> 01:17:28.709
your father, James Whitcomb,
that's when I knew.

01:17:28.745 --> 01:17:30.478
- I said stop.
- I was sure.

01:17:30.513 --> 01:17:32.491
They-they did a show together.
I-I have the program.

01:17:32.515 --> 01:17:35.816
- I can show you the program.
- What?

01:17:35.852 --> 01:17:37.685
Can't you see what she's doing?

01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:39.286
This is obviously
some sort of scam.

01:17:39.322 --> 01:17:41.389
- She-she wants money.
- No, please..

01:17:41.424 --> 01:17:43.290
You had it all planned.

01:17:43.326 --> 01:17:45.626
You fooled us all
with your touching story.

01:17:45.662 --> 01:17:48.162
'Well, I won't listen
to another word of it.'

01:17:48.197 --> 01:17:49.964
I want you out. Leave.

01:17:49.999 --> 01:17:51.899
Alright, that's enough, Peter.

01:17:51.934 --> 01:17:53.668
- Stop.
- What?

01:18:01.177 --> 01:18:02.576
You have your father's eyes.

01:18:05.348 --> 01:18:06.847
You knew.

01:18:06.883 --> 01:18:08.849
I suspected..

01:18:08.885 --> 01:18:10.751
...from the first moment
that I saw you.

01:18:12.021 --> 01:18:14.889
But it was the poem
that convinced me.

01:18:16.893 --> 01:18:17.992
Eve was your mother.

01:18:20.263 --> 01:18:21.629
Just never knew her name.

01:18:22.699 --> 01:18:26.133
Mother, I don't understand..

01:18:26.169 --> 01:18:29.070
Peter, you were too young
to remember.

01:18:29.105 --> 01:18:30.771
You were just a toddler
when your father

01:18:30.807 --> 01:18:33.374
started to have success
as an actor.

01:18:33.409 --> 01:18:35.976
The more successful he became..

01:18:36.012 --> 01:18:38.813
...the harder it was for us
to be together.

01:18:38.848 --> 01:18:40.514
Finally, I just had had enough

01:18:40.550 --> 01:18:44.452
and I, I asked him
for a divorce.

01:18:44.487 --> 01:18:46.120
What?

01:18:46.155 --> 01:18:48.889
We were waiting
for the divorce to become final

01:18:48.925 --> 01:18:50.991
when James got a call
from a friend of his

01:18:51.027 --> 01:18:53.060
in San Francisco
who was directing

01:18:53.096 --> 01:18:55.062
a production of "The Tempest."

01:18:55.098 --> 01:18:57.932
He had to replace his lead actor
and he begged James

01:18:57.967 --> 01:18:59.867
to step in and..

01:19:01.671 --> 01:19:03.270
...he was on a plane that night.

01:19:05.108 --> 01:19:06.674
And that's when
he met your mother.

01:19:08.611 --> 01:19:11.278
Initially, it was strictly
professional.

01:19:11.314 --> 01:19:15.616
But soon James began
to open up about our divorce

01:19:15.651 --> 01:19:18.319
and they grew closer, and..

01:19:21.958 --> 01:19:23.158
...finally, they fell in love.

01:19:23.192 --> 01:19:26.093
So, why did he leave?

01:19:26.129 --> 01:19:30.464
Now, the story might have ended
there, but Peter got sick.

01:19:32.101 --> 01:19:33.400
Pneumonia.

01:19:34.871 --> 01:19:36.570
James told Eve,
and she was the one

01:19:36.606 --> 01:19:38.606
who convinced him to come home

01:19:38.641 --> 01:19:40.741
to look after his son,
to take care of his family.

01:19:42.678 --> 01:19:43.844
She let him go.

01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:47.081
And when Peter started
to recover

01:19:47.116 --> 01:19:48.482
we realized that
we really wanted

01:19:48.518 --> 01:19:54.355
to try to save the marriage,
and-and... we did.

01:19:54.390 --> 01:19:57.958
I mean, it-it wasn't easy,
but we, we worked things out

01:19:57.994 --> 01:20:01.762
and I was with him
until he died.

01:20:04.901 --> 01:20:08.135
I still don't understand how you
know all this about my mother.

01:20:08.171 --> 01:20:10.704
Because he told me everything.

01:20:10.740 --> 01:20:12.406
Except for her name.

01:20:14.544 --> 01:20:15.810
And I forgave him.

01:20:18.648 --> 01:20:20.014
I realize that your mother..

01:20:21.651 --> 01:20:24.518
Oh, she must have loved him
very, very much.

01:20:24.554 --> 01:20:27.621
So much that she was willing
to let him go.

01:20:27.657 --> 01:20:30.157
I have no idea
how she did that.

01:20:30.193 --> 01:20:32.193
I..

01:20:32.228 --> 01:20:34.662
I mean, I can only imagine
how heart-broken she was.

01:20:37.099 --> 01:20:38.799
But I have always been grateful.

01:20:41.938 --> 01:20:44.471
But wh-what about me?

01:20:46.642 --> 01:20:49.043
Miranda..

01:20:49.078 --> 01:20:50.511
Honey, I promise you

01:20:50.546 --> 01:20:53.247
if James had had any idea
that he had another child

01:20:53.282 --> 01:20:56.584
he would have moved
heaven and earth to find you

01:20:56.619 --> 01:20:59.386
to take care of you.

01:20:59.422 --> 01:21:00.487
Yeah.

01:21:03.693 --> 01:21:06.760
That's why she never told me.

01:21:06.796 --> 01:21:09.430
Because it would have been
too painful to see him again

01:21:09.465 --> 01:21:12.132
knowing she couldn't
be with him.

01:21:14.670 --> 01:21:17.304
So she raised me on her own.

01:21:17.340 --> 01:21:20.808
And she gave me all the love
that she couldn't give him.

01:21:20.843 --> 01:21:22.243
Oh..

01:21:22.278 --> 01:21:25.212
God, he would have loved you
so much.

01:21:25.248 --> 01:21:26.647
Thank you.

01:21:26.682 --> 01:21:28.082
Come here.

01:21:42.431 --> 01:21:43.497
Miranda..

01:21:45.434 --> 01:21:48.068
...about what I said..

01:21:48.104 --> 01:21:50.104
...I'm sorry.

01:21:50.139 --> 01:21:52.606
It's alright.

01:21:52.642 --> 01:21:54.642
The truth is, growing up

01:21:54.677 --> 01:21:56.844
I used to wish I had a brother
or a sister.

01:21:58.481 --> 01:22:00.247
Maybe we can find out
what that's like.

01:22:02.351 --> 01:22:03.450
Yeah.

01:22:06.389 --> 01:22:08.289
Listen. Can you hear them?

01:22:08.324 --> 01:22:09.501
