WEBVTT

00:02.267 --> 00:04.603
Okay, great,
we'll see you then.

00:04.636 --> 00:08.340
Okay, that was Jim,
he's at the airport with Mom.
They'll be here in 45 minutes.

00:08.374 --> 00:11.110
Whoa! I just got
that knot in my stomach.

00:11.143 --> 00:12.578
(GROANS)

00:12.611 --> 00:14.581
I've had it since
I knew she was coming.

00:16.114 --> 00:18.083
Do you guys have that
knot in your stomach?

00:18.117 --> 00:20.053
Yeah.

00:20.085 --> 00:22.354
It's even worse
now that she's bringing
what's-his-name.

00:22.388 --> 00:25.258
Hey, hey, hey.
Her boyfriend's name
is Frank.

00:25.291 --> 00:26.626
Ow!

00:25.291 --> 00:26.626
Ow!

00:27.626 --> 00:29.829
Frank, oh,
isn't that perfect?

00:29.861 --> 00:31.797
I'm Frank,
I'm glad your
dad's dead.

00:31.830 --> 00:33.131
I kiss your mom
on the lips.

00:33.164 --> 00:34.801
Oh!

00:34.834 --> 00:37.236
All right, all right.
Dad's been gone
for two years

00:37.268 --> 00:39.439
and Mom finally
found somebody
who made her happy.

00:39.472 --> 00:41.274
We should support her.

00:41.307 --> 00:43.276
Look who's still
desperate to be
the favorite.

00:43.308 --> 00:46.178
Sorry, peaches,
you'll never be
the baby.

00:46.212 --> 00:50.083
Please. I've given her
three grandchildren.
It's not even a contest.

00:51.484 --> 00:53.419
Hi, Mommy!

00:51.484 --> 00:53.419
Oh! Oh!

00:53.451 --> 00:55.287
Okay! Mom,
you look great!

00:55.320 --> 00:56.388
Thank you, honey.

00:56.421 --> 00:58.256
I thought you were
45 minutes away.

00:58.289 --> 00:59.558
Oh, I love that gag.

00:59.591 --> 01:01.560
All you need is
a phone and a sucker.

01:01.594 --> 01:02.829
(LAUGHS)

01:02.862 --> 01:05.531
Frank, let me
introduce you
to everyone.

01:05.563 --> 01:06.631
This is Cheryl.

01:06.665 --> 01:07.700
Hi.

01:06.665 --> 01:07.700
Cheryl, hi.

01:07.733 --> 01:08.768
And Dana.

01:08.801 --> 01:09.835
Hello, Dana.

01:08.801 --> 01:09.835
Hi.

01:09.868 --> 01:12.237
And there's my baby.

01:12.271 --> 01:13.338
Hugs?

01:18.710 --> 01:19.778
Hey.

01:25.683 --> 01:27.420
You have a lovely
home, Cheryl.

01:27.453 --> 01:28.487
Thanks for
opening it
to us.

01:28.521 --> 01:30.156
Oh, it's
my pleasure.

01:30.188 --> 01:32.524
So anybody for some
peach strawberry
iced tea?

01:32.558 --> 01:34.327
Oh, yeah.

01:34.359 --> 01:36.228
What, did a gay
delivery truck hit
a pot hole out front?

01:37.730 --> 01:40.733
So, honey, how is
the job hunt going?
Any nibbles?

01:40.766 --> 01:42.401
Oh, yeah,
there's plenty
of nibbles.

01:42.433 --> 01:44.203
Plenty of nibbles,
yeah, yeah.

01:44.236 --> 01:45.505
Oh, good.
Any jobs?

01:45.537 --> 01:48.406
Oh, jobs.
Jobs, jobs...

01:48.439 --> 01:50.676
No.

01:50.709 --> 01:53.612
Just remember,
on your next
job interview,

01:53.646 --> 01:55.414
show off the bosom.

01:55.447 --> 01:56.816
Powerful men like that.

01:56.849 --> 01:58.551
(LAUGHING)

01:58.584 --> 02:00.552
That's how your mom
reeled me in.

02:02.888 --> 02:04.790
How about a kiss
on the lips?

02:08.661 --> 02:10.663
Uncle Frank is
getting a boat.

02:10.695 --> 02:13.265
Uncle Frank is
gonna teach us
how to tie knots.

02:13.299 --> 02:15.234
Hmm.

02:13.299 --> 02:15.234
You're a sailor,
huh, Frank?

02:15.266 --> 02:18.670
That's right,
it was my passion
until I met your mother.

02:18.704 --> 02:19.838
Now it's just a hobby.

02:19.872 --> 02:21.240
Oh!

02:21.272 --> 02:23.276
My father was
a landlubber.

02:23.308 --> 02:25.377
But, by God,
we loved him.

02:28.413 --> 02:31.383
Andy's kind of an idiot.
Maggie's already
told you, right?

02:32.418 --> 02:33.453
Yes.

02:35.955 --> 02:39.325
So, Uncle Frank.
Wow, I just...

02:39.358 --> 02:42.194
I remember when
you had to be related
to use that title.

02:42.228 --> 02:43.896
Did you hear
that, Frank?

02:43.929 --> 02:47.466
No, Maggie,
I was otherwise
engaged.

02:47.498 --> 02:49.467
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

02:49.501 --> 02:52.572
Oh, my God,
you guys are
getting married?

02:52.604 --> 02:54.873
I guess we just
can't hide
our bliss, huh?

02:54.907 --> 02:56.342
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

02:56.375 --> 02:57.644
(ALL GROANING)

02:59.544 --> 03:01.280
Welcome to the family.

03:01.312 --> 03:02.714
Here, change
your grandson.

03:07.953 --> 03:09.322
(EXCLAIMS)

03:10.389 --> 03:11.724
Oh, baby!

03:13.000 --> 03:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:24.703 --> 03:27.840
Is that Ruby's diary?
You shouldn't read that.

03:27.872 --> 03:30.209
This is how we keep
one step ahead of her.

03:32.510 --> 03:34.980
You know, I just don't
like that Frank.

03:35.014 --> 03:38.016
Did you see the way he was
massaging my mother's
shoulders in the kitchen?

03:38.050 --> 03:40.552
And the way he keeps
calling her "honey"?

03:40.586 --> 03:43.289
And then
he pulls her chair
out at the table.

03:44.757 --> 03:46.960
Yeah, you're right,
he's a real psychopath.

03:48.926 --> 03:50.562
Oh, look,

03:50.596 --> 03:53.466
she thinks her
dad's a hero.

03:53.498 --> 03:54.567
Really?

03:54.599 --> 03:56.269
No, I'm writing it in.

04:01.907 --> 04:04.477
Hey, Jim, Jim.
I need you to focus.

04:04.509 --> 04:07.479
You know, they've only
known each other two months
and they're getting married?

04:07.513 --> 04:09.515
I just... I think there's
something rotten here.

04:09.548 --> 04:10.748
I think you're
being paranoid.

04:10.782 --> 04:13.852
Am I? You know, she's
giving him the money
to buy that boat.

04:13.885 --> 04:15.454
Wait, wait,
I didn't hear about this.
What's that about?

04:15.486 --> 04:16.855
Yes.

04:16.889 --> 04:19.858
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna run
a background check on Frank.

04:19.891 --> 04:21.761
All I need is
his driver's license.

04:24.663 --> 04:26.699
What do you know about
background checks?

04:26.732 --> 04:28.367
Dana ran one on you
before we got married.

04:28.399 --> 04:29.534
What?

04:31.803 --> 04:33.805
I am totally outraged!

04:33.838 --> 04:36.009
That is an invasion
of privacy.

04:38.744 --> 04:41.314
Oh, look who's got
a crush on Harry Potter.

04:42.480 --> 04:43.615
Jim!

04:46.117 --> 04:48.353
Now this knot is
the yachtsmen's favorite.

04:48.387 --> 04:51.589
It won't jam
and it's easy to
undo in a pinch.

04:51.622 --> 04:53.358
Cool.

04:51.622 --> 04:53.358
Ooh!

04:53.391 --> 04:56.394
Isn't he just a wizard
with the knots?

04:56.427 --> 04:57.829
Yeah, a real wizard.

04:59.764 --> 05:01.567
Like your boyfriend,
Harry Potter.

05:01.600 --> 05:02.969
He's not my boyfriend!

05:04.435 --> 05:05.437
Jim.

05:08.807 --> 05:12.378
Listen, Frank,
Jim and I were thinking
about getting a boat.

05:12.411 --> 05:14.413
Really? You guys
can afford a boat?

05:14.446 --> 05:16.549
Yes.

05:16.581 --> 05:19.552
And we were wondering,
do you need some sort of
special license or...

05:19.584 --> 05:21.586
Oh, sure, I've had
my license for years.

05:21.620 --> 05:22.655
Oh...

05:22.687 --> 05:23.990
Can I see it?

05:27.158 --> 05:28.728
I mean, you know, it's...

05:28.761 --> 05:30.596
It's a kind of
a hobby of mine.

05:31.863 --> 05:34.032
I like looking
at licenses.

05:35.634 --> 05:37.470
I didn't know that
about you, Jim.

05:37.502 --> 05:39.538
Oh, sure, Maggie.

05:39.571 --> 05:42.975
My father was a...
A laminator.

05:46.512 --> 05:48.447
I'm sorry,
I left it in Florida.

05:48.480 --> 05:50.649
Oh. Well...

05:50.682 --> 05:53.119
Can I see your
driver's license?

05:53.151 --> 05:56.421
I mean, I can picture you
with a captain's hat on.

05:56.454 --> 05:58.557
It's an old
laminator's trick,
you know.

06:00.158 --> 06:01.860
It's in my wallet upstairs.

06:03.461 --> 06:04.863
You really need to
see it right now?

06:04.896 --> 06:06.731
Well, you know...

06:04.896 --> 06:06.731
No, no, no, no.

06:06.764 --> 06:08.867
Wait. We've got
nothing but time.

06:08.901 --> 06:11.504
Yeah, you know,
maybe I should
go start lunch.

06:11.536 --> 06:12.837
Jim, Andy, Dana,
will you help me?

06:12.870 --> 06:14.873
Yeah.

06:14.906 --> 06:17.642
Now, girls,
this is a sheepshank.

06:17.675 --> 06:18.877
Cool.

06:17.675 --> 06:18.877
Cool.

06:18.911 --> 06:20.879
My daddy tied
his shoes every day,

06:20.913 --> 06:22.749
but we didn't
sell tickets to it.

06:24.182 --> 06:25.418
JIM: Andy!

06:27.519 --> 06:29.155
"My father was a laminator"?

06:29.187 --> 06:30.423
(SIGHS)

06:31.088 --> 06:32.824
Lunch at 9:30?

06:34.660 --> 06:36.629
You guys can afford a boat?

06:38.497 --> 06:39.365
What's going on?

06:39.398 --> 06:41.167
We wanna run
a background check
on Frank.

06:41.199 --> 06:42.868
Oh, like we did with Jim?

06:45.103 --> 06:46.771
Dana thought
you had crazy eyes.

06:46.805 --> 06:48.072
What?

06:48.105 --> 06:49.207
You were the one
who said that.

06:49.240 --> 06:50.475
Well, look at him,
am I wrong?

06:50.509 --> 06:51.811
No.

06:50.509 --> 06:51.811
The guy's...

06:51.843 --> 06:53.711
I'm mad right now,
not crazy!

06:51.843 --> 06:53.711
All right, all right.

06:53.745 --> 06:56.081
Guys, we need
you to keep Mom
and Frank occupied

06:56.113 --> 06:57.882
while we go upstairs
and go through
Frank's wallet.

06:57.915 --> 06:59.050
Right.

06:57.915 --> 06:59.050
All right.

06:59.084 --> 07:01.052
Listen...

06:59.084 --> 07:01.052
CHERYL: What?

07:01.086 --> 07:04.956
If something goes wrong
and one of us doesn't make it
to the other side,

07:04.990 --> 07:06.859
I just wanna say...

07:06.891 --> 07:07.992
Well, damn it,
I love you guys.

07:08.026 --> 07:09.728
Oh, get out
of here!

07:12.497 --> 07:14.666
Oh, jeez. Oh!

07:15.766 --> 07:16.968
Look at this.

07:17.903 --> 07:20.706
Three shoehorns,
two feet.

07:22.673 --> 07:25.911
You're right, Cheryl,
something doesn't add up.

07:25.944 --> 07:27.947
Jim, would you stop it?
Hurry up.

07:27.980 --> 07:29.148
All right.

07:32.250 --> 07:33.751
You know what,
you should just relax.

07:33.785 --> 07:35.221
This is our bedroom.
We can always say...

07:35.254 --> 07:36.822
Oh, my God,
your mom's underwear.

07:36.855 --> 07:37.890
Trade places.

07:40.225 --> 07:42.795
It's 10:00, honey.
It's time for
your heart medication.

07:42.827 --> 07:43.962
Oh, yes,
I should get that.

07:43.995 --> 07:45.130
No!

07:47.533 --> 07:50.235
(STAMMERING)
I mean, I'll get it.

07:50.269 --> 07:52.271
Don't be silly,
I'll run up
and grab it.

07:52.303 --> 07:54.706
No. wait.
Mom, um...

07:54.740 --> 07:56.175
I kissed a girl in college!

07:59.745 --> 08:01.146
Me too.

08:02.247 --> 08:04.050
Andy, don't tell stories.

08:05.884 --> 08:07.819
(WHISPERING)
Do something.

08:07.853 --> 08:08.653
(WHISPERING)
I'll head up the back
stairs and cut her off.

08:08.687 --> 08:09.855
Okay.

08:09.887 --> 08:11.257
Oh, oh, oh, oh!
Ah-ha! Ah-ha!

08:11.290 --> 08:12.525
What? You got it?

08:11.290 --> 08:12.525
Okay.

08:12.557 --> 08:13.992
Yes, "Frank Crowley."

08:14.026 --> 08:16.929
Remember this number,
"B-9-4-8-7-3-6-1-9."

08:16.961 --> 08:18.163
Wait!

08:19.697 --> 08:21.299
How am I supposed to
remember that?

08:21.333 --> 08:24.203
Jim, it's easy, B-9,
like benign.

08:24.235 --> 08:27.238
4-8, it's the
San Francisco 49ers,
minus one.

08:27.271 --> 08:29.675
73. Andy was
born in '73.

08:29.708 --> 08:32.010
And 6-1-9 is
the area code
for San Diego.

08:34.812 --> 08:36.749
Are you wearing a bra?

08:36.782 --> 08:38.049
(INAUDIBLE)

08:38.350 --> 08:39.619
Oh!

08:40.619 --> 08:41.886
What's going on here?

08:41.919 --> 08:43.788
Well, we were just...

08:43.822 --> 08:45.090
(STAMMERING) Uh...

08:45.123 --> 08:47.225
(PANTING)
Hurry, she's coming.

08:48.259 --> 08:49.528
(EXCLAIMS)

08:54.332 --> 08:56.067
God, you're fast.

09:06.812 --> 09:09.315
I can't believe that
you would go through
Frank's things like that.

09:09.347 --> 09:11.115
Well, Mom, you're
gonna marry the guy,

09:11.149 --> 09:13.018
and we just
wanted to find out
a little bit about him...

09:13.051 --> 09:15.721
I thought
I raised my children
better than this.

09:15.754 --> 09:19.358
Oh...

09:15.754 --> 09:19.358
Well, I have an excuse,
I'm the middle child.

09:19.390 --> 09:21.726
And I'm the baby,
Cheryl made me do it.

09:21.759 --> 09:22.927
Hugs.

09:22.961 --> 09:24.930
Give it a rest, Andy.

09:24.962 --> 09:28.099
Now, take these pills
down to Frank.

09:29.934 --> 09:32.136
Not now.

09:32.169 --> 09:34.872
Mom, I didn't really
kiss a girl in college.

09:34.905 --> 09:35.974
Me neither.

09:38.110 --> 09:39.677
(SIGHING)

09:39.711 --> 09:41.947
Oh, come on, Mom,
can you blame us?

09:41.980 --> 09:43.615
I mean,
you've only known
Frank two months

09:43.649 --> 09:44.883
and you're buying
him a boat?

09:44.916 --> 09:47.152
I am not buying it.

09:47.184 --> 09:51.122
I am lending him the money
until the apartment building
that he sold in Boca Raton

09:51.155 --> 09:52.657
closes escrow.

09:52.691 --> 09:56.095
Maggie, I got to tell you,
if I were gonna take advantage
of a vulnerable widow,

09:56.128 --> 09:58.030
that's exactly
how I would do it.

09:59.931 --> 10:03.902
What? My mind wanders
while I'm driving.

10:03.934 --> 10:06.738
Mom, you know,
you do hear all the time
about smooth talkers

10:06.772 --> 10:08.641
taking advantage of

10:08.673 --> 10:09.975
people like you.

10:10.008 --> 10:13.245
Oh, you mean,
old and alone?

10:13.278 --> 10:15.748
No...

10:13.278 --> 10:15.748
You know, maybe Frank
and I should just leave.

10:15.780 --> 10:17.849
Don't go, Maggie.
Maggie, Maggie,
don't do that.

10:17.883 --> 10:19.317
They're just worried
about you, that's all.

10:19.350 --> 10:20.918
Come on, they
really love you, Maggie.

10:20.951 --> 10:22.855
Mom, we love you.
Don't go.

10:23.688 --> 10:24.956
Well what about Frank?

10:24.990 --> 10:26.191
Totally forgotten.

10:26.224 --> 10:27.725
Oh, can't
we start over?

10:27.759 --> 10:28.826
Do-over. A do-over!

10:28.860 --> 10:29.927
Yeah.

10:28.860 --> 10:29.927
Yeah.

10:29.961 --> 10:31.096
(LAUGHING)

10:31.129 --> 10:33.399
Okay. Thank you.

10:33.432 --> 10:35.868
Okay, I know,
I know, we can do
a girls' night out,

10:35.900 --> 10:37.301
like an impromptu
bridal shower.

10:37.335 --> 10:40.272
Yeah, hey, you can
use my registry.

10:37.335 --> 10:40.272
Yeah!

10:40.304 --> 10:42.240
Yeah, I already
set one up.

10:42.274 --> 10:43.808
(LAUGHS)

10:43.841 --> 10:46.245
What? It comforts me.

10:46.278 --> 10:48.913
Stop looking at me.

10:48.947 --> 10:51.316
And, Jim, Jim,
maybe you and Andy
can take Frank out.

10:51.349 --> 10:52.918
A bachelor party?

10:56.087 --> 10:58.089
Well, I mean,
I'm not really,
you know,

10:58.123 --> 11:00.158
a boobs-and-liquor
kind of guy.

11:01.993 --> 11:04.330
But, you know,
if you think
it would help...

11:07.131 --> 11:08.867
(SULTRY MUSIC BLARING)

11:17.375 --> 11:19.445
You know,

in recent years.

11:23.215 --> 11:24.450
Do you come here a lot?

11:24.482 --> 11:26.184
Ah, once or twice.

11:26.217 --> 11:27.819
Hey, Misty. Yeah.

11:27.852 --> 11:29.487
How's your son?

11:29.520 --> 11:31.823
If he's still
having a problem with
those fractions, call me.

11:33.524 --> 11:35.727
Maybe three times.

11:35.760 --> 11:37.929
All right, here we go,
another round.

11:37.962 --> 11:39.397
Oh, Jim, I said
I'd get the next round.

11:39.431 --> 11:43.335
Oh, no, don't be silly,
this is your bachelor party.
I wouldn't hear of it.

11:43.368 --> 11:45.471
We'll settle up
at the end of the night.

11:46.403 --> 11:48.874
To Frank and Maggie.

11:50.375 --> 11:51.844
Mmm. Mmm.

11:51.876 --> 11:53.211
Oh! Whoa!

11:53.245 --> 11:55.480
I don't usually
drink tequila.

I can't imagine why.

how are you doing?

Hey, Venus,
how's the new puppy?

12:05.389 --> 12:08.192
Oh, Mr. Patches,
he is so cute.

12:08.225 --> 12:10.162
So, who am I shaking
my business at?

12:10.195 --> 12:13.265
Right there.
I'm buying you
a dance, my friend.

12:13.298 --> 12:14.365
No, no, no,
I couldn't.

my daughter braces.

had soup here.

12:30.816 --> 12:32.785
Why?

12:32.817 --> 12:35.153
I don't know.
There's something about
naked women and soup.

to talk to you.

we, you know,
had a few drinks

talking about?

a strip club and you
bought him a lap dance.

a bachelor party.

What? You want me
to take him
to Color Me Mine?

do that kind of thing.

what happened
the other day,

and run that background
check on Frank.

an inkling about something,
you're usually right.

about you but...

the record straight.

And?

16:12.437 --> 16:14.639
Cheryl, Frank was a con man.

He did time for fraud.

16:16.640 --> 16:18.075
Get out!

16:18.109 --> 16:20.278
Oh, no, he's been
scamming widows
for years.

16:20.311 --> 16:22.346
He was gonna take
Maggie for everything.

16:22.379 --> 16:24.216
Oh, my God.

16:24.249 --> 16:26.652
Hey, what about that
apartment complex
in Boca Raton?

16:28.253 --> 16:31.023

if there ever was
a Boca Raton.

16:33.124 --> 16:34.292
Where're you going?

16:34.325 --> 16:36.094
I got to go tell my mom.

16:34.325 --> 16:36.094
Why?

16:36.126 --> 16:38.096
So something like this
doesn't happen again.

16:38.129 --> 16:39.464
So instead of just
feeling heartbroken,

16:39.496 --> 16:41.198
she's got to feel
heartbroken and stupid?

16:41.231 --> 16:43.568

I think I know what's best.

16:45.803 --> 16:47.672

Oh, no, no, no, no,
you're coming.

16:47.705 --> 16:49.541
You killed him.

16:47.705 --> 16:49.541
I didn't kill him!

make a sandwich.

where I'd wash dishes

17:08.291 --> 17:11.796
and you would stand on
a stool next to me and be
my dryer and we'd talk?

17:11.829 --> 17:13.396
Yeah.

17:13.431 --> 17:16.201
Life goes by so fast.

with Ruby and Gracie?

a sandwich by himself before.

labels on these things.

18:02.747 --> 18:04.316

to kill her?

18:04.348 --> 18:07.284
What? No! Tell her.

18:07.317 --> 18:09.587
Honey, if you're
gonna whisper,
you need to enunciate.

18:09.621 --> 18:11.288
Imagine if I had
acted immediately.

18:11.321 --> 18:13.691
Oh, come on, sweetheart.
Just... Please do it.
Please tell her.

18:13.724 --> 18:15.759
No, no, I told you
I didn't wanna do it
in the first place.

18:15.792 --> 18:17.194
Honey, I'm begging you.

18:17.228 --> 18:18.897

I am begging you.
Please, please, please.

18:18.930 --> 18:20.865
No, I'm not gonna do it. No.

18:20.898 --> 18:22.667

18:34.578 --> 18:38.817
So, Maggie,
how's the healing
process going?

18:41.519 --> 18:44.923
Jim, Frank died
last night.

18:44.955 --> 18:47.125
So... Slowly?

18:51.828 --> 18:54.398
You know, every time
I'd walk into a room,

18:54.432 --> 18:55.834
he would look up at me
and he would say,

18:55.866 --> 18:57.769
"You know what,

18:57.801 --> 19:00.337
"I'm really happy."

19:00.371 --> 19:02.841
And for the first time,

19:02.874 --> 19:04.875
boy, in a long time,

19:04.909 --> 19:06.678
I felt so...

19:07.377 --> 19:08.547
So alive.

19:11.548 --> 19:13.617
Yeah.

19:13.651 --> 19:15.554
Maggie,
Frank was a thief.

19:18.288 --> 19:19.290
What?

19:19.324 --> 19:20.358
JIM: Yeah...

19:19.324 --> 19:20.358
Because he...

19:20.391 --> 19:21.927
He stole your heart,

19:21.960 --> 19:24.895
and that's
what thieves do.
They steal.

19:24.929 --> 19:28.567
But this is
a good kind
of stealing.

19:28.599 --> 19:32.303
Because Frank was
a good man, Mom.

19:32.336 --> 19:34.839
And that's how
we'll always
remember him.

19:36.473 --> 19:38.710
Right?
Jim, isn't that
what you meant?

19:38.742 --> 19:40.178
Uh, apparently.

19:43.280 --> 19:45.282
Thank you, honey.
You too.

19:45.316 --> 19:46.951
Oh, yeah, Maggie.

19:46.984 --> 19:49.420
I'm gonna go
upstairs and pack.

19:46.984 --> 19:49.420
Okay.

You did the right thing.

19:53.691 --> 19:55.927
Oh, thank you.

19:55.960 --> 19:59.698
You know, Cheryl,
while I was running that
background check on Frank,

19:59.730 --> 20:01.398
I also ran one on you.

20:01.432 --> 20:03.401
What?

20:03.433 --> 20:05.002
Don't worry,
don't worry.

20:05.036 --> 20:08.373
You know, you came up
perfectly clean.

20:05.036 --> 20:08.373
Okay.

20:08.405 --> 20:09.607
Mabel.

20:08.405 --> 20:09.607
(EXCLAIMS)

20:10.974 --> 20:12.810
You told me
you didn't have
a middle name.

20:12.844 --> 20:14.778
I hate it.
Don't you ever
use that again.

20:14.811 --> 20:17.348
All right,
your secret's
fine with me.

20:19.483 --> 20:21.019
(IN SINGSONG VOICE)
Mabel, Mabel,
set the table.

20:21.051 --> 20:22.486
Stop it, stop it,
I mean it,
I mean it, Jim.

20:22.519 --> 20:23.855
Pour the drinks
if you're able.

20:22.519 --> 20:23.855
Stop it!

20:23.887 --> 20:25.356
La, la, la, la, la...
