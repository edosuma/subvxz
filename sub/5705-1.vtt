When enemy forces attacked

14:45.384 --> 14:47.443
although it can repulse them

14:47.453 --> 14:50.251
but if they are approached in this way

14:50.256 --> 14:53.225
our position is weak,
if they suddenly attacked

14:53.259 --> 14:55.386
If you want to reduce losses

14:55.427 --> 14:58.328
we cut their way out

14:58.364 --> 15:00.264
Give warning shots

Suppose clashes

40:20.351 --> 40:22.376
Did not you used to wear the right hand?

40:42.506 --> 40:46.408
Later, because she wants to
use the technique of cutting

40:46.444 --> 40:50.312
commander's eyes and hands
helmsman must adjust to each other

40:50.314 --> 40:51.508

44:44.314 --> 44:45.406
Fast

44:55.459 --> 44:57.484

01:04:16.385 --> 01:04:18.512
You do not have to worry

01:04:19.322 --> 01:04:22.450

01:51:21.541 --> 01:51:23.304
There are levels of difficulty

01:51:23.309 --> 01:51:25.334
But the hull is not inverted or tilted

01:51:25.378 --> 01:51:27.471
I think the search could be easier

01:51:27.480 --> 01:51:29.380
You mean, the ship
was standing straight?

01:51:29.416 --> 01:51:30.405

01:58:16.489 --> 01:58:19.458
The second fleet command headquarters
filled with the sound muffled

01:58:19.459 --> 01:58:21.518
Due to the handover

01:58:21.527 --> 01:58:25.361
the sound generated by
naval special assistance

while securing 16 of the

At that time, we would like to alert

01:58:56.395 --> 01:58:59.330
but the enemy kept heading south

01:58:59.332 --> 01:59:03.359
So we are trying to cut their way

01:59:03.369 --> 01:59:07.328
Other than usual, they kept coming

01:59:07.373 --> 01:59:11.275
When aligned with our ships

01:59:11.277 --> 01:59:13.211

At that time, surveillance Cao was

At that time he told
me, I was going to die

01:59:42.341 --> 01:59:44.434
I look at the commander

01:59:44.477 --> 01:59:47.503

02:00:03.429 --> 02:00:06.421
The other was seriously wounded

02:00:06.432 --> 02:00:08.491
He began to give instructions

02:00:08.501 --> 02:00:11.265

02:00:11.304 --> 02:00:13.272
I say, it seems she has fallen

02:00:13.439 --> 02:00:17.273
Sometimes you can
dream of those who died

02:00:17.276 --> 02:00:21.235
Dream to fight again

02:00:21.280 --> 02:00:23.339
