WEBVTT

00:01.305 --> 00:03.307
- Oh, whoa, whoa,
when did that start happening?

00:03.351 --> 00:04.613
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

00:04.656 --> 00:06.441
- Lauren Dumont with
the Aviation Authority.

00:06.484 --> 00:08.704
I'll be coming by the hangar
to speak with you and your crew.

00:08.747 --> 00:10.358
- I kind of forgot about
the wedding.

00:10.401 --> 00:12.099
- Maybe you needed a break
from thinking about it.

00:12.142 --> 00:14.579
- Wait, that was you?
- Orion 24?

00:14.623 --> 00:16.016
- Why did you do this for me?

00:16.059 --> 00:17.539
- My mom died of cancer.

00:17.582 --> 00:20.716
- I'll take you to dinner,
but I'll expect you to put out

00:20.759 --> 00:22.631
with a good reference letter.
- You're applying to med school?

00:22.674 --> 00:24.459
- The only thing I've ever known
about my birth parents

00:24.502 --> 00:25.808
is that they never wanted me.

00:25.851 --> 00:27.288
And I never want my kid
to feel that.

00:27.331 --> 00:30.030
- We're gonna be a family,
Bodie.

00:31.031 --> 00:33.381
[birds chirping]

00:35.296 --> 00:38.168
[serene music]

00:42.868 --> 00:46.872
[energetic music]

01:24.171 --> 01:25.998
- The smoke...

01:26.042 --> 01:27.348
It's so ominous.

01:27.391 --> 01:29.611
- Wildfire Season happens
like clockwork now.

01:29.654 --> 01:32.004
The sky's dramatic,
but the fires are still way off.

01:32.048 --> 01:35.138
- Going once, going twice.
Madison?

01:35.182 --> 01:36.531
- No, I can't.
Baby on board!

01:36.574 --> 01:39.708
- Right, sorry.
I keep forgetting. Bodes?

01:40.883 --> 01:43.581
- Best part of wildfire season
is the planes.

01:43.625 --> 01:45.192
- Hey, you see the 215s
on the ramp yesterday?

01:45.235 --> 01:46.193
- Ugh, water bomber talk.

01:46.236 --> 01:48.064
[squealing]

01:48.108 --> 01:49.805
[laughing]

01:55.941 --> 01:58.857
- Pizza and wings from the Lion?
I'll call it in.

01:58.901 --> 02:00.903
- Yeah. No wimping out
on peppers this time.

02:00.946 --> 02:02.644
- Alright...
- See you tomorrow, Bodes.

02:04.080 --> 02:06.909
- Hey, so I think I might go
visit my grandparents this week.

02:07.910 --> 02:09.259
- Uh-huh.

02:10.347 --> 02:12.393
[indistinct chattering]

02:15.700 --> 02:18.747
- From this day forward,
for better and for worse,

02:18.790 --> 02:20.183
in sickness and in health,

02:20.227 --> 02:23.969
to love and to cherish,
till death do us part.

02:25.449 --> 02:29.236
- I, Petra, take you...
[clears throat]

02:29.279 --> 02:30.672
[sniffles]

02:30.715 --> 02:33.240
Sorry. Um.

02:33.283 --> 02:34.502
[cameras clicking]

02:34.545 --> 02:36.373
I....
[sniffles]

02:36.417 --> 02:38.810
[coughing]

02:40.029 --> 02:41.596
[sniffles]

02:41.639 --> 02:45.034
I, uh... I can't.

02:45.077 --> 02:46.862
I'm sorry, I just can't.

02:46.905 --> 02:48.646
- Petra, wait!

02:48.690 --> 02:49.952
[sniffles]

02:51.040 --> 02:54.217
- I tried, Glen.
I really tried, but...

02:54.261 --> 02:55.218
[cameras clicking]

02:55.262 --> 02:56.306
[coughing]

02:56.350 --> 02:57.960
[crowd shouting]

02:58.003 --> 03:00.180
[tense music]

03:08.013 --> 03:09.711
- Have you had stomach
issues recently?

03:09.754 --> 03:12.148
- Um, I've been taking
a lot of antacids.

03:12.192 --> 03:14.368
- How many a day?
- Two...

03:15.238 --> 03:17.545
...bottles.
- A day?!

03:17.588 --> 03:19.938
- Yeah.
- I think you may have
a perforated ulcer.

03:19.982 --> 03:22.114
I'll monitor your vitals to make
sure you don't go into shock,

03:22.158 --> 03:23.855
and we'll get you
to the hospital for surgery.

03:23.899 --> 03:27.468
- I knew it wasn't right.
Glen's just not the right one,

03:27.511 --> 03:30.253
but everything was arranged,
and all those deposits...

03:30.297 --> 03:32.429
- Nothing good comes from
bottling up your feelings.

03:32.473 --> 03:34.170
They always find their
way out somehow.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.564
- Not if you're Polish.

03:38.043 --> 03:40.481
- Hey Kookoo, just checking in,

03:40.524 --> 03:42.178
see how smoky it was up there.

03:42.222 --> 03:45.442
Let me know if you need
anything, 'kay? Kisâkihitin.

03:45.486 --> 03:47.488
- Hey, there you are.

03:47.531 --> 03:51.100
Patient needs to be intubated.
I want you to observe.

03:53.145 --> 03:55.278
Thought you might like
a preview of med school.

03:55.322 --> 03:57.541
- And to show me how cool
you are?

03:57.585 --> 03:59.021
[chuckling]

03:59.064 --> 04:01.937
I used to work with a doc
who was scared to do these,

04:01.980 --> 04:03.765
because if you screw 'em up...

04:03.808 --> 04:06.811
He'd always page RT instead.
- Just takes practice.

04:06.855 --> 04:08.204
[air whooshing]

04:08.248 --> 04:10.250
See, take the laryngoscope...

04:11.555 --> 04:13.862
and you insert the blade.

04:15.385 --> 04:18.388
Use the bracket to push
the tongue out of the way.

04:18.432 --> 04:22.087
Now inch your way down
until you see the epiglottis.

04:22.131 --> 04:23.654
That's the tricky part.

04:25.177 --> 04:28.268
Carefully lift the epiglottis
out of the way.

04:28.311 --> 04:31.183
Blade goes into the vallecula.

04:31.227 --> 04:33.795
And I insert the ET tube.

04:40.454 --> 04:42.107
Now attach the BVM.

04:48.418 --> 04:50.115
- Just that easy, huh?

04:50.159 --> 04:51.900
- Ooh, no, not at first.

04:51.943 --> 04:55.207
But if you want
to start practicing now.

04:55.251 --> 04:56.774
Can you get your hands
on a dummy?

04:56.818 --> 04:58.689
- Got a house full of 'em.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.823
[radio static]

05:01.866 --> 05:03.477
[Chopper over radio]:
Hey, Emma. You there?

05:04.608 --> 05:06.001
- Hey!

05:06.044 --> 05:07.829
- What's the sky doing in
North House?

05:07.872 --> 05:10.092
You know, just checking
for visibility.

05:10.135 --> 05:12.224
- Yeah, um, it's kind
of an apocalyptic pink?

05:12.268 --> 05:15.358
It's my first real wildfire
season here, so...

05:15.402 --> 05:17.273
I'm a little bit nervous.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.797
- It's scary the first time.
But the reports say the fires

05:19.841 --> 05:21.146
are headed away from you.

05:22.496 --> 05:25.412
- Hey, it's really good to hear
your voice.

05:26.413 --> 05:29.938
Um... because I was wondering
if you were you the crew that

05:29.981 --> 05:33.637
picked up the runaway bride?
- Uh. No, no, that was 922.

05:33.681 --> 05:36.597
- Right. I was wondering if
she might be willing to sell
her dress for a discount.

05:36.640 --> 05:39.687
- Heh... Right.

05:39.730 --> 05:41.602
[door opening]

05:41.645 --> 05:44.387
- Uh, gotta go, Ryan.
- I need an enema kit.

05:44.431 --> 05:47.216
- Hey, Isabelle. You okay?
Do you need medical attention?

05:47.259 --> 05:49.610
- I don't need your "medicine".
That stuff doesn't work.

05:49.653 --> 05:52.439
I just need an enema kit
to clean out my dog's ears.

05:52.482 --> 05:54.441
- Let me see.

05:54.963 --> 05:57.357
- A lot of fuss
for cheap embroidery.

05:57.400 --> 05:59.576
In my day, weddings were simple.

05:59.620 --> 06:02.971
Divorce too. A man came home to
find his shoes waiting outside.

06:03.014 --> 06:05.103
Pfft, he knew.

06:05.147 --> 06:06.888
- Well, I can't spare an enema
kit for a dog,

06:06.931 --> 06:08.585
but would these work?

06:08.629 --> 06:10.239
[door opening]

06:10.282 --> 06:12.328
- Hey, Tansi!

06:14.156 --> 06:16.114
I got you something special.

06:16.158 --> 06:18.900
- Why'd you waste your money
on this?

06:18.943 --> 06:20.815
- So the dog stops stealing
your bannock, Auntie.

06:20.858 --> 06:22.904
- Awas, you.
Drive me home.

06:22.947 --> 06:24.122
- Okay.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.566
[tense music]

06:34.872 --> 06:36.526
- Let's get a bomber up
to Bear River.

06:36.570 --> 06:38.180
And we need somewhere
to park this pumper.

06:38.223 --> 06:40.617
- I don't care where you put it,
just get it off my runway.

06:40.661 --> 06:43.359
God damn it. Every year,
we're overrun by nozzle jockeys,

06:43.403 --> 06:45.361
strutting around,
taking up hangar space.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.189
- Fighting wildfires,
saving lives?

06:47.232 --> 06:50.148
- Whatever. Look. Av's doing
interviews about Wheezer's crash

06:50.192 --> 06:51.323
at North House today.

06:51.367 --> 06:53.369
You're gonna do the smart thing,
right?

06:53.413 --> 06:55.153
Help us both out.

06:55.197 --> 06:58.069
- Brad, you doubled the cargo.

06:58.113 --> 07:00.420
You didn't care the straps
weren't secure.

07:00.463 --> 07:03.901
- And you walked away
without telling anyone.

07:03.945 --> 07:06.164
It's just as much your fault
as much as mine, Lexi.

07:06.208 --> 07:08.689
Which is why you're going
to say that you loaded the cargo
like normal,

07:08.732 --> 07:11.039
and the straps were fine.
Because if you don't,

07:11.082 --> 07:13.171
we are both going down.

07:13.215 --> 07:16.610
- I'll risk it. If I get fired,
I'll go somewhere else.

07:16.653 --> 07:19.656
- Oh yeah? Where? Portage,
Spruce?

07:19.700 --> 07:21.179
[gasps]
Mountain Air.

07:21.223 --> 07:23.094
I know guys at all those places,

07:23.138 --> 07:25.836
and they're not gonna want
to hire a pilot who won't have
their back.

07:25.880 --> 07:28.143
So if you ever want
to fly again...

07:29.274 --> 07:31.363
be smart.

07:34.845 --> 07:38.196
- Captain Austen Bodie,
this is Aviation Authority
Representative Edwards.

07:38.240 --> 07:40.068
Part of the team investigating
William's crash.

07:40.111 --> 07:42.723
- Captain Bodie, pleasure to
meet you. Sit down.

07:42.766 --> 07:44.725
I understand that you
and your colleagues

07:44.768 --> 07:47.510
got William out of the plane
before it caught on fire.
Well done.

07:47.554 --> 07:49.164
- He'd have done the same
for me.

07:49.207 --> 07:50.513
- You're close
with William Heaseman?

07:50.557 --> 07:52.080
- He's like a brother to me.

07:52.123 --> 07:54.256
He trained me,
did my Line Indoc.

07:54.299 --> 07:56.737
- And did you see him
in the 12-hours leading up
to the crash?

07:56.780 --> 07:59.566
- Yeah, the night before,
we stayed up late, we talked.

07:59.609 --> 08:02.264
- And did you witness William
consume any alcohol

08:02.307 --> 08:04.788
or narcotics during that
12-hour period?

08:04.832 --> 08:06.877
- What? Of course not.
- You're sure?

08:06.921 --> 08:09.445
- Wheezer wouldn't do that.
He's a good pilot

08:09.489 --> 08:11.447
- I just need to understand
if there's any way

08:11.491 --> 08:13.318
that he might have been
impaired.

08:13.362 --> 08:16.060
- No way. When it comes to
flying, Wheezer's by the book.

08:16.104 --> 08:17.584
His barbecuing,
on the other hand...

08:17.627 --> 08:19.237
[chuckling]

08:19.281 --> 08:21.544
Sorry. That was inappropriate.

08:21.588 --> 08:23.938
- When you arrived at the scene,
what did you observe?

08:23.981 --> 08:26.418
- O-GHR9 had gone off the west
side of the runway.

08:26.462 --> 08:29.291
The electrics were
still running, and there was
a ruptured fuel line.

08:29.334 --> 08:30.727
- And what about
Captain Heasemen?

08:30.771 --> 08:32.207
- He was pinned against
the control panel,

08:32.250 --> 08:33.948
so we had to remove several
boxes so I could

08:33.991 --> 08:35.993
get him in a collar
and out of the plane.

08:36.037 --> 08:38.082
- Now, why did you have
to remove boxes?

08:38.126 --> 08:41.303
- The cargo had all
come loose and slid forward
into the cockpit.

08:41.346 --> 08:46.961
- So would you say then that
it looked like the cargo was not
properly secured?

08:47.004 --> 08:48.005
- Yes.

08:48.049 --> 08:49.441
- Care to elaborate?

08:49.485 --> 08:51.618
- No.

08:53.489 --> 08:56.318
- I understand you loaded
the cargo.

08:56.361 --> 08:59.974
- That's right. I loaded
the Caravan as per usual.

09:00.017 --> 09:01.845
- And the cargo
was within limits?

09:01.889 --> 09:03.586
- Yes.
- And were you able

09:03.630 --> 09:06.589
to secure the cargo using
the appropriate tie downs?

09:07.851 --> 09:12.639
- Yes. The load was properly
strapped down last I saw it.

09:13.291 --> 09:16.773
- Sorry to interrupt.
Constable Jennifer Lee,
Northern Police.

09:16.817 --> 09:19.863
- I thought this was an Aviation
Authority investigation.

09:19.907 --> 09:21.517
- Just sitting in.

09:21.561 --> 09:24.825
- You were saying
that the cargo you loaded

09:24.868 --> 09:28.350
was securely fastened using
appropriate tie downs, correct?

09:28.393 --> 09:29.917
- Yes, I--
- Ms. Martine,

09:29.960 --> 09:32.615
did you confirm the cargo
matched the manifest?

09:32.659 --> 09:37.359
- It's standard practice
to cross-check all cargo with
the manifest.

09:37.402 --> 09:39.622
- But did you personally
confirm that the cargo

09:39.666 --> 09:43.234
on PAF O-GHR9 matched
the manifest?

09:43.887 --> 09:46.020
- Yes. They matched.

09:48.413 --> 09:50.720
- What can
you tell me about this?

09:53.114 --> 09:56.204
- They taste good with rice?
[chuckles]

09:56.247 --> 10:00.295
- We found about a dozen cans of
baked beans at the crash site.

10:00.338 --> 10:03.341
Funny thing. Guess
what's not on the manifest?

10:04.995 --> 10:06.431
- Baked beans.

10:06.475 --> 10:08.956
- How do you explain that,
Ms. Martine?

10:08.999 --> 10:12.307
- No idea. What I loaded
matched the manifest.

10:12.350 --> 10:14.962
- That's your official
statement?

10:17.094 --> 10:18.792
[sighing]

10:21.751 --> 10:23.535
[breathing heavily]

10:23.579 --> 10:26.234
- Hey. You okay?

10:26.277 --> 10:30.630
- Yeah. Just low blood sugar.
Never skip lunch.

10:33.458 --> 10:35.417
- My focus was on Wheezer's...

10:35.460 --> 10:38.202
Sorry, William's potential
spinal injury.

10:38.246 --> 10:40.291
- Was Jeremy Wood
at the airstrip that day?

10:40.335 --> 10:41.771
- Um...

10:42.816 --> 10:45.645
There were a lot of volunteers
from the community.

10:45.688 --> 10:48.082
- And was Jeremy Wood
one of them?

10:48.648 --> 10:50.127
- Yeah, yes.

10:50.171 --> 10:52.782
I'm sorry, what does this have
to do with the crash?

10:52.826 --> 10:56.177
- Ms. Roberts, when you arrived
at the North House airstrip...

10:56.220 --> 10:59.615
- Um, Wheezer was conscious,
but disoriented.

10:59.659 --> 11:03.619
Nurse Highway assessed
his injuries while I assembled
a staging area.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.752
[pager beeping and buzzing]

11:05.795 --> 11:08.711
Um, sorry, I'm on duty,
I have a medevac.

11:08.755 --> 11:10.931
- We'll call if there's
anything else.

11:16.414 --> 11:20.418
- 22-year-old woman, thrown from
a horse. Appaloosa, I believe.

11:20.462 --> 11:21.942
Beautiful animal.

11:21.985 --> 11:25.075
No signs of internal
bleeding or concussion,

11:25.119 --> 11:26.642
she was wearing a helmet.

11:26.686 --> 11:29.776
Needs to go to Thompson
for imaging.

11:29.819 --> 11:32.648
Patient is 20 weeks pregnant.

11:32.692 --> 11:35.346
She'll need an ultrasound
to confirm

11:35.390 --> 11:39.133
no fetal or placental injury.

11:39.176 --> 11:42.614
- Please.
Just don't tell Bodie.

11:42.658 --> 11:46.053
[tense music]

11:49.012 --> 11:51.841
[fire crackling]

11:53.538 --> 11:57.107
It's still safe to be flying
in this? I can smell the smoke.

11:57.151 --> 11:59.501
- It drifts pretty far.

11:59.544 --> 12:02.199
But Chopper says the fires feel
closer than they are.

12:03.157 --> 12:06.682
- Kind of late for me to be
worrying about safety now, huh?

12:06.726 --> 12:08.640
I can't believe I was so stupid.

12:08.684 --> 12:10.251
- Have you always ridden?

12:10.294 --> 12:13.167
- Yeah, since I was 10.

12:13.210 --> 12:15.125
It's my grandpa's horse.

12:15.169 --> 12:17.824
I've known him for years, but
I haven't been on for a while.

12:17.867 --> 12:21.175
I guess I've just been so busy
with work, and Bodie, and...

12:21.218 --> 12:23.133
I guess I just...

12:23.177 --> 12:24.831
Everything's been changing
so fast,

12:24.874 --> 12:28.748
I just wanted something that
felt normal again, you know?

12:30.184 --> 12:32.403
- You're allowed to want normal,
Madison.

12:33.578 --> 12:35.667
- But what if I hurt the baby?

12:38.279 --> 12:41.891
- Let's take it one step
at a time, okay?

12:44.589 --> 12:47.244
[soft music]

12:48.768 --> 12:50.552
- I know you didn't know.

12:50.595 --> 12:54.077
About me or...
this when you and Bodie...

12:54.121 --> 12:57.820
- I, uh... I wouldn't have...

12:58.778 --> 13:00.257
- I know.

13:02.259 --> 13:04.958
If it wasn't for this, I...

13:07.525 --> 13:10.746
I don't think Bodie and
I would still be together.

13:10.790 --> 13:13.705
It doesn't even really feel like
we're dating anymore.

13:13.749 --> 13:16.796
It just feels like
we're playing house, or...

13:17.797 --> 13:19.842
like, putting on a show.

13:19.886 --> 13:21.017
[sighs]

13:23.454 --> 13:25.935
If I lose the baby, I...

13:25.979 --> 13:27.937
- Let's... Let's wait for
the ultrasound.

13:29.634 --> 13:31.680
One step at a time, right?

13:43.387 --> 13:44.954
- Does Bodie know?

13:44.998 --> 13:47.304
We have to tell him.
That's his baby.

13:47.348 --> 13:50.133
- Madison is the patient.
And she has the right to
confidentiality.

13:50.177 --> 13:52.701
Who she calls, or doesn't,
that's up to her.

13:57.314 --> 13:58.620
[door slamming]

13:58.663 --> 14:00.578
[engine starts]

14:01.623 --> 14:03.103
[phone beeps]

14:03.146 --> 14:05.540
[ringing tone]

14:05.583 --> 14:07.107
[beeps]

14:12.982 --> 14:15.115
22-year-old woman,
20 weeks pregnant,

14:15.158 --> 14:17.421
suffered a fall from a horse.
Vitals stable during flight.

14:17.465 --> 14:20.207
- Wait! Come with me.

14:20.250 --> 14:22.470
- Madison, I'm supposed to
transfer care--

14:22.513 --> 14:24.298
- Please. I don't want
to be alone.

14:24.341 --> 14:27.083
[phone ringing in distance]

14:33.263 --> 14:35.222
[sighs]

14:45.667 --> 14:47.756
[heart beating softly]

14:48.626 --> 14:52.587
- I have a heartbeat.
That's a good sign.

14:56.112 --> 14:58.332
- I'm gonna call Bodie
now that we know it's okay.

14:59.594 --> 15:02.249
[breathing heavily]

15:14.783 --> 15:16.872
- Okay, thanks
for letting me know.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.656
[phone beeps]

15:18.700 --> 15:22.356
Hey. Heard about Madison.
- Look, I know, okay?

15:22.399 --> 15:25.489
Bodie's your friend,
you don't think it was right
to keep him in the dark.

15:25.533 --> 15:28.101
- You protected your patient.
Good work.

15:29.929 --> 15:31.452
[indistinct background chatter]

15:31.495 --> 15:33.845
- Have you had your interview
with Aviation Authority yet?

15:33.889 --> 15:35.717
- No, I had practicum today.

15:35.760 --> 15:38.198
I'll go in tomorrow before
I head up to North House for
my day off.

15:38.241 --> 15:40.200
- Okay, well, you should know
that the police are sitting in,

15:40.243 --> 15:42.071
and they're asking a lot of
questions.

15:42.115 --> 15:43.768
They asked me about Jeremy.

15:44.944 --> 15:46.554
Don't worry.

15:46.597 --> 15:48.425
I didn't mention anything about
the night you sewed him up.

15:49.687 --> 15:51.559
- Thanks.

15:51.602 --> 15:53.561
[country music]

15:54.692 --> 15:58.000
- Okay, is it just me,
or is this place full of...?

15:58.044 --> 16:00.698
- There's a reason we call
wildfire time Snagging Season.

16:00.742 --> 16:03.049
- Oh, yeah.
[laughing]

16:05.268 --> 16:07.053
- Everything alright?

16:07.096 --> 16:08.184
- Peachy.

16:08.837 --> 16:11.057
How small is the aviation
industry?

16:11.100 --> 16:12.797
Could one person torch
your career?

16:12.841 --> 16:16.192
- Before you came up here,
we had this guy, Rossi.

16:16.236 --> 16:17.802
Liked to sleep with people's
girlfriends,

16:17.846 --> 16:19.543
including his captain's.

16:19.587 --> 16:21.023
No one would fly with him
after that.

16:21.067 --> 16:23.330
So he just decided he'd drive
to the next town,

16:23.373 --> 16:24.896
get hired there.

16:24.940 --> 16:26.376
- And...?

16:26.420 --> 16:28.422
- Last I heard,
he's still driving.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.688
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:33.731 --> 16:35.385
- You made it!

16:35.429 --> 16:39.433
- How's Madison?
- Good. She was in good hands.

16:39.476 --> 16:41.870
- Does anybody need a drink?

16:46.309 --> 16:49.312
[indistinct background chatter]

16:49.356 --> 16:51.923
- So, what do we know about
Transport?

16:51.967 --> 16:53.838
- Still doing interviews
tomorrow.

16:53.882 --> 16:57.320
And I... kinda felt like
they were trying to pin this
on Wheezer.

16:57.364 --> 16:59.931
- I'm sure they'll find
whatever, or whoever, caused
this crash.

16:59.975 --> 17:03.370
- No, if someone's
to blame for hurting Wheezer,
their ass is mine.

17:06.460 --> 17:09.506
- Two years. That's a long time
to be up here.

17:09.550 --> 17:12.292
- Yeah. It's starting
to feel like home.

17:12.335 --> 17:16.035
- Are there any good hikes
around here?

17:16.078 --> 17:17.645
- You like a casual stroll,

17:17.688 --> 17:20.213
or something that takes a little
more... effort?

17:20.256 --> 17:21.736
[chuckles]

17:21.779 --> 17:23.825
- I don't mind working for it.

17:23.868 --> 17:27.568
You see, back in cadets, Nowak
used to know all the good hikes.

17:27.611 --> 17:29.135
These days, he's pretty
much useless.

17:29.178 --> 17:31.137
- I don't hike because
I only have time for my job

17:31.180 --> 17:32.877
and my other job.

17:32.921 --> 17:34.314
[laughing]

17:34.357 --> 17:36.446
- I still can't believe you guys
are friends. I mean,

17:36.490 --> 17:39.319
Eric's so charming.
And you're... Nowak.

17:39.362 --> 17:40.972
[chuckles]

17:41.016 --> 17:43.801
- Don't let that stern Polish
brunch daddy vibe fool you.

17:43.845 --> 17:46.065
When I first started boot camp,
I hated it.

17:46.108 --> 17:47.370
I couldn't do any of the drills,

17:47.414 --> 17:49.503
and all the other guys wanted
to kick my ass.

17:49.546 --> 17:51.896
Except Nowak.

17:52.419 --> 17:55.726
He used to get up at dawn
every day

17:55.770 --> 17:57.902
to help me practice until
I got it down.

17:57.946 --> 18:00.079
- Still less painful than
watching you drop your rifle

18:00.122 --> 18:01.471
every five minutes.
On my toes.

18:02.385 --> 18:03.778
[phone ringing]

18:07.825 --> 18:09.305
- And that's my mom.

18:09.349 --> 18:13.222
She, uh, worries.
I'll catch up with you later?

18:13.266 --> 18:14.484
- You better.

18:17.052 --> 18:19.054
[chuckles]

18:22.536 --> 18:24.146
So what's his deal?
- Don't waste your time.

18:24.190 --> 18:25.365
- Why? Is he straight?

18:25.408 --> 18:26.975
- No. He's just not for you.

18:27.018 --> 18:28.542
- What's that supposed to mean?

18:29.325 --> 18:32.850
Hey, I decide who's for me.

18:34.330 --> 18:36.158
Thanks.

18:39.727 --> 18:41.337
[sighs]

18:41.381 --> 18:44.558
[tense music]

18:47.865 --> 18:50.999
[fire crackling]

18:58.572 --> 19:00.400
[sighs]

19:00.443 --> 19:02.532
- It was clear the patient had
a spinal injury,

19:02.576 --> 19:05.579
and I did everything I could
to keep Wheezer conscious
and talking.

19:05.622 --> 19:07.537
- And what was Jeremy Wood
doing?

19:07.581 --> 19:10.149
- Helping to get Wheezer out.
- By moving cargo?

19:10.192 --> 19:11.454
- Everyone was moving cargo.

19:11.498 --> 19:13.195
There was imminent danger
of fire.

19:13.239 --> 19:16.851
- And can you describe
the boxes Jeremy removed
from the Caravan?

19:16.894 --> 19:19.245
What they looked like,
what was in them?

19:19.288 --> 19:21.595
What happened to them
after the crash?

19:24.206 --> 19:26.252
- Wind's turned,
fires are on the move.

19:26.295 --> 19:27.949
We're getting dropped in
to hold the line,

19:27.992 --> 19:29.994
but North House needs to be
evacuated as soon as possible.

19:30.038 --> 19:32.954
- That's my community.
- Go.

19:32.997 --> 19:36.000
[tense music]

19:54.454 --> 19:55.542
- We got everyone?

19:55.585 --> 19:57.413
- One unaccounted for,
I'll go get her.

19:57.457 --> 19:58.893
- This is the last plane
for North House,

19:58.936 --> 20:00.242
then we're moving on
to Deep Lake.

20:00.286 --> 20:01.548
We've got hundreds of people
to evacuate,

20:01.591 --> 20:02.853
we can't stall.

20:02.897 --> 20:04.333
- I'll bring her to
the airstrip.

20:04.377 --> 20:07.423
[tense music]

20:13.690 --> 20:15.518
Isabelle, North House
is being evacuated.

20:15.562 --> 20:16.911
- I know.

20:16.954 --> 20:18.652
- So we need to get going.
The plane's waiting.

20:18.695 --> 20:20.523
- I'm looking for my dog.

20:20.567 --> 20:21.959
- The fires are moving fast.

20:22.003 --> 20:23.700
If we're not there,
they'll move on to Deep Lake.

20:23.744 --> 20:26.094
- You go. I'm not leaving
without Buttercup.

20:26.137 --> 20:28.923
Buttercup!
[whistles]

20:28.966 --> 20:30.664
I usually find her hiding here,

20:30.707 --> 20:32.187
after she steals the fish guts.

20:32.231 --> 20:34.755
- Isabelle, we really need
to get to the airstrip now.

20:34.798 --> 20:36.278
- I spoiled the damn thing.

20:36.322 --> 20:37.758
She can't take care of herself
out here.

20:37.801 --> 20:39.368
- I'm sure she'll be fine.
When you come back--

20:39.412 --> 20:41.240
- She was my husband's dog.

20:41.283 --> 20:43.416
Roy's spirit still visits me,

20:43.459 --> 20:46.245
and if I don't take care
of his dog, he'll give me shit.

20:50.031 --> 20:51.815
- No, no, no.
They can't go yet. Wait!

20:51.859 --> 20:54.427
Wait, stop! We're still here!
[thudding]

20:54.470 --> 20:55.950
Argh!

20:55.993 --> 20:58.300
- Oh! You're gonna need
some bear grease on that.

21:02.304 --> 21:04.567
- That's beautiful.

21:04.611 --> 21:06.961
I always wished I could be more
artistic.

21:07.004 --> 21:08.179
- Why can't you?

21:08.223 --> 21:09.833
There.

21:09.877 --> 21:11.966
That'll help with healing.

21:12.009 --> 21:13.968
And I'll get the tea
for the pain.

21:14.011 --> 21:16.840
- Isabelle, how are we getting
out of here?

21:16.884 --> 21:18.625
The fires are headed in
this direction.

21:18.668 --> 21:22.324
- Holeh, settle down. When
it's time, we'll go by boat.

21:22.368 --> 21:24.152
- You have a boat?

21:24.195 --> 21:26.763
- You didn't think there
was only one way out of here,
did you?

21:26.807 --> 21:28.548
- Well, okay, great. Let's go.

21:28.591 --> 21:30.985
- I need to find Buttercup.

21:32.682 --> 21:34.510
- You love your husband
very much.

21:34.554 --> 21:35.990
[sighs]

21:36.686 --> 21:39.646
- Once in a while,
some old man will come around

21:39.689 --> 21:41.474
and try to shack up.

21:41.517 --> 21:42.866
But...

21:44.390 --> 21:48.132
I never one time wanted
to leave Roy's shoes outside.

21:49.743 --> 21:52.354
- How did you know he was
the one?

21:52.398 --> 21:55.618
- Love isn't like that.
There isn't a "one".

21:55.662 --> 21:57.577
You choose someone to be with,

21:57.620 --> 22:00.623
and then you're together
as long as it works,

22:00.667 --> 22:02.364
until you're not.

22:03.191 --> 22:04.845
- How do you know if it works?

22:04.888 --> 22:06.977
- My kookum always told me,

22:07.021 --> 22:10.851
"Don't listen to your heart.
Your heart can be confused.

22:10.894 --> 22:14.028
And don't listen to your head,
your head can be fooled.

22:15.116 --> 22:16.900
Listen to your spirit.

22:16.944 --> 22:19.163
Spirit always knows."

22:19.207 --> 22:21.731
What does your spirit tell you?

22:27.563 --> 22:29.913
- That we have
to find Buttercup.

22:29.957 --> 22:31.175
[chuckles]

22:32.394 --> 22:34.396
[tense music]

22:39.140 --> 22:41.447
[indistinct chattering]

22:43.536 --> 22:46.408
- How's your COPD been
with all this smoke, Wayne?

22:46.452 --> 22:48.410
- It's crap.
He's been wheezing a lot.

22:48.454 --> 22:50.238
[muttering]

22:50.281 --> 22:51.848
- Well, you keep an eye on him,
okay?

22:51.892 --> 22:53.502
Let me know if it gets
any worse.

22:53.546 --> 22:55.199
- Maskwa, astam.

22:55.243 --> 22:57.332
Want to pass out these
sandwiches out? Thanks, man.

22:58.159 --> 23:02.685
- I'm always saying I want
to see my aunties and uncles
more, but not like this.

23:02.729 --> 23:04.687
- Yeah. Wildfires never used
to happen

23:04.731 --> 23:08.038
when we did controlled burns.
But what do our people know?

23:08.735 --> 23:10.650
- How close are they
to North House?

23:11.520 --> 23:13.087
- Too close.

23:13.130 --> 23:16.046
- They only get one bag.
If the community burns, then...

23:16.090 --> 23:18.440
- Hey, have you seen Emma?

23:18.484 --> 23:20.224
- No, I'm the only nurse here.

23:20.268 --> 23:22.575
- She was supposed to be on the
last flight out of North House,

23:22.618 --> 23:24.098
but it just landed.

23:24.141 --> 23:25.926
You, uh, haven't heard from
her at all, have you?

23:25.969 --> 23:27.406
- No.

23:28.537 --> 23:30.931
- Okay, we can fit eight,
so let's keep it coming!

23:30.974 --> 23:32.715
Hopefully, we can have you back
in Deep Lake soon.

23:32.759 --> 23:34.413
[speaking Anishinaabemowin]

23:34.456 --> 23:36.110
- Alright, there you go.

23:36.153 --> 23:37.981
- Here, watch your head, okay?

23:38.025 --> 23:39.548
- Keep on coming,
keep on coming.

23:41.289 --> 23:43.770
Everything okay?
- You came back.

23:44.466 --> 23:45.598
- Sorry?

23:45.641 --> 23:47.338
- You're Jolene's son.

23:48.992 --> 23:50.211
You look just like her.

23:54.868 --> 23:57.392
- Sorry.
Guess I have a familiar face.

23:59.655 --> 24:02.441
Uh, we've got people
to board still, so...

24:04.834 --> 24:09.230
Uh... Bags on the plane.
Walk around the back to get on.

24:21.024 --> 24:23.070
- Crystal! Uncle Wayne,
he can't breathe.

24:25.899 --> 24:28.162
- I called 911,
but with the fires, I...

24:28.205 --> 24:30.251
Just get here, okay?

24:32.862 --> 24:35.778
- He's cyanotic. There's
no time. Get him on his back.

24:35.822 --> 24:37.737
[wheezing]

24:43.177 --> 24:45.614
Okay, hold this over his mouth,
20 breaths per minute.

24:45.658 --> 24:47.268
- No...
- Yes.

24:49.966 --> 24:52.099
Wayne, I'm going to put
a tube in to help you breathe.

24:54.231 --> 24:57.496
[tense music]

25:02.239 --> 25:06.461
Okay, hold his head still.
Yeah.

25:09.290 --> 25:12.511
[tense music]

25:37.492 --> 25:39.276
Here, yeah.

25:40.016 --> 25:41.583
Okay, now hold this.

25:47.458 --> 25:49.983
[soft music]

25:55.162 --> 25:58.426
- Is he going to be okay?
- The tube's in.

26:04.084 --> 26:06.956
- Get him on Norepi,
run an ABG.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.437
Did you intubate this man?
- Yes.

26:09.480 --> 26:11.613
- You're not certified, Crystal.
You haven't been trained.

26:11.657 --> 26:13.746
- I know.
- You could lose your license.

26:13.789 --> 26:15.748
- I couldn't just let him die.

26:15.791 --> 26:18.577
Are you going to report me?
- You're lucky it worked.

26:24.713 --> 26:27.803
- I saw something run this way.
Buttercup!

26:27.847 --> 26:29.022
[coughing]

26:29.065 --> 26:31.764
[whimpering]
Buttercup? Come here!

26:31.807 --> 26:33.287
- Is that her?

26:33.330 --> 26:34.810
- She won't move

26:34.854 --> 26:36.725
- Probably spooked
by the smoke.

26:36.769 --> 26:38.509
[whimpering]

26:38.553 --> 26:40.294
- Do you have any bannock?

26:40.337 --> 26:42.513
- Oh, of course...

26:44.646 --> 26:47.997
- Come on, you little thief.
Yeah, good girl!

26:48.041 --> 26:50.870
- That's my girl.
- Good girl, good girl.

26:53.220 --> 26:54.221
- Is this safe?

26:54.264 --> 26:56.136
- Keep a grip, she hates water.

26:56.179 --> 26:58.747
We'll go down-river,
away from the fire.

26:58.791 --> 27:00.531
[coughing]

27:00.575 --> 27:02.359
[plane engine roaring]

27:02.403 --> 27:04.492
[coughing]

27:04.535 --> 27:07.321
- The last plane left hours ago.

27:19.159 --> 27:21.074
- Emma?
- Chopper!

27:26.296 --> 27:27.863
[laughing]

27:27.907 --> 27:29.299
Thanks, Chopper.

27:29.343 --> 27:31.301
- And they all laughed
when I did my Float Rating.

27:31.345 --> 27:32.476
You guys okay?

27:32.520 --> 27:34.870
- No. I need help getting
on the plane.

27:35.654 --> 27:39.483
Ooh... I'm taken, but I have
a granddaughter who's available!

27:39.527 --> 27:40.920
[chuckles]

27:43.226 --> 27:45.011
[barking]

27:48.797 --> 27:51.191
[tense music]

27:55.238 --> 27:57.545
- Hoses off!
It's spreading too fast!

27:57.588 --> 28:00.287
At this rate, we could
lose North House and Deep Lake.

28:00.330 --> 28:03.072
We need a control line,
box it into the river!

28:03.116 --> 28:06.206
Start laying retardant
20 feet from the tree line.

28:06.249 --> 28:07.816
All of this all needs
to be cleared.

28:07.860 --> 28:09.339
Eric, you're with me
on explosives.

28:11.428 --> 28:13.343
[Fire Captain]: Gotta clear
anything that can burn

28:13.387 --> 28:14.867
before the fire gets here.

28:14.910 --> 28:18.697
I'll lay a line of C4 while you
roll out the deck cord.

28:18.740 --> 28:20.786
[Eric]: Line set.

28:25.921 --> 28:27.140
Grounding.

28:27.183 --> 28:28.707
- Careful opening the circuit.

28:28.750 --> 28:31.187
Any stray spark or static
electricity can set it off.

28:31.231 --> 28:33.276
Phones and radios off.

28:34.843 --> 28:37.716
[tense music]

28:40.283 --> 28:42.546
[phone ringing]

28:42.590 --> 28:44.244
Back away slowly.

28:51.207 --> 28:52.992
[groaning]

28:54.820 --> 28:57.953
Eric! Eric!

29:00.913 --> 29:03.480
[Fire Captain]: He had his phone
in his pocket. When it rang,

29:03.524 --> 29:06.570
it created enough static
electricity to set off
the charges.

29:06.614 --> 29:08.355
He pushed me out of the way.

29:08.398 --> 29:10.400
- Okay, he's alive.

29:10.444 --> 29:13.403
We have to cool him down,
his skin is still burning.

29:13.447 --> 29:15.101
- I'll get more saline
from the truck.

29:15.144 --> 29:17.233
- Nowak, help me cover
his burns.

29:17.277 --> 29:18.452
[groaning]

29:18.495 --> 29:21.629
- You... I never gave you
my number.

29:21.672 --> 29:23.370
But you're here?

29:23.413 --> 29:26.677
- Yep. Gotta say, Eric,
shitty spot for a hike.

29:26.721 --> 29:27.678
[chuckles]

29:28.636 --> 29:31.291
[groaning]

29:32.422 --> 29:34.207
Okay, you're going to be okay.

29:34.250 --> 29:36.383
We'll cool you down,
get some fluids into you.

29:36.426 --> 29:38.864
Time to get you out of here.
- No, no! I can't leave.

29:38.907 --> 29:41.388
- Eric, you're severely burned,
you need treatment.

29:41.431 --> 29:44.086
- I can't leave my team.

29:45.958 --> 29:47.786
- You're a liability, soldier.

29:47.829 --> 29:50.353
You need to get out of the way
so the team can finish the job.

29:53.139 --> 29:54.488
- Okay.

29:58.666 --> 30:01.234
[indistinct chattering]

30:02.670 --> 30:04.585
- You get everyone out
of North House?

30:04.628 --> 30:06.761
- Wheezer,
what are you doing here?

30:06.805 --> 30:08.371
- All hands on deck, right?

30:08.415 --> 30:10.417
Don't need a good back to help
out in Dispatch.

30:10.460 --> 30:12.201
Just a couple of ice packs.

30:14.813 --> 30:17.076
Lynn's family,
they're from North House.

30:17.990 --> 30:19.295
They're my family too.

30:19.339 --> 30:22.951
- Well, we got them all out.

30:22.995 --> 30:25.736
We're evacuating Deep Lake now,
then we're on to Black Tree.

30:25.780 --> 30:28.435
- Don't let me stop you from
being a hero.

30:28.478 --> 30:30.741
Good work, Lexi.

30:35.007 --> 30:36.965
- You hear about this bullshit
with his crash?

30:37.009 --> 30:38.271
- No, what?
- Aviation Authority's

30:38.314 --> 30:40.360
gonna hang it all on Wheezer.
"Pilot error."

30:40.403 --> 30:42.057
- They can't do that.
- They'll pull his license.

30:42.101 --> 30:44.277
He may never fly again.

30:44.320 --> 30:46.583
- But it's not his fault.

30:50.718 --> 30:52.241
[sighs]

30:58.769 --> 31:00.249
Chief?

31:01.816 --> 31:03.774
I need to amend my statement.

31:03.818 --> 31:07.561
In the interview,
I didn't tell the truth.

31:08.518 --> 31:11.565
But you need to know the crash
wasn't Wheezer's fault.

31:12.218 --> 31:13.872
The plane was overloaded.

31:13.915 --> 31:16.613
Brad told me to double the load
on the sched,

31:16.657 --> 31:18.702
but there was no way to secure
it properly with the tie downs,

31:18.746 --> 31:20.443
so I refused.

31:20.487 --> 31:22.663
I thought I was doing the right
thing, walking off the job,

31:22.706 --> 31:24.883
but... That's all I did.

31:25.405 --> 31:29.844
I knew it wasn't safe,
and I just... walked away.

31:29.888 --> 31:31.585
I should have reported it.

31:31.628 --> 31:34.893
Instead, I let it happen.

31:35.458 --> 31:37.373
- I see.

31:38.897 --> 31:42.335
- I know you'll probably
fire me. I accept that.

31:42.378 --> 31:44.554
- What made you come
forward now?

31:45.077 --> 31:48.384
- Wheezer is a good pilot, sir.

31:48.428 --> 31:50.169
He's a good person.

31:51.344 --> 31:53.824
When any of us put on
our gold bars,

31:53.868 --> 31:56.523
it doesn't just mean we know
how to fly a plane,

31:56.566 --> 32:00.962
or that we put in our time
on the ramp to get to a cockpit.

32:01.006 --> 32:04.835
It means we will put the safety
of everyone in the plane first.

32:06.663 --> 32:09.101
It means we have integrity.

32:11.451 --> 32:14.193
Even if you took my bars away
now...

32:15.672 --> 32:20.764
I don't think I would've
been able to put them on again
anyway, if I hadn't told you.

32:23.767 --> 32:25.987
- That'll be all, Martine.

32:34.256 --> 32:35.910
[indistinct chattering]

32:35.954 --> 32:39.609
[laughing]

32:41.568 --> 32:43.787
[indistinct chattering]

32:46.486 --> 32:48.401
- Hey!
- Kookum!

32:48.444 --> 32:49.837
[dog whining]

32:53.058 --> 32:54.798
- Isabelle is your grandmother?

32:54.842 --> 32:58.541
- Yeah. We can never get her
to evacuate by plane.

32:58.977 --> 33:01.675
The first time she was on
one was when she was stolen
from her parents

33:01.718 --> 33:03.894
and forced
to a residential school.

33:07.159 --> 33:11.380
- Well, come on! If you're
serious about beading.

33:18.300 --> 33:20.824
[phone ringing]
- Hello?

33:22.087 --> 33:24.002
[laughing]

33:24.045 --> 33:26.569
The fire changed direction.
North House is safe!

33:26.613 --> 33:28.397
[cheering]

33:34.403 --> 33:35.796
[sighs]

33:38.277 --> 33:41.497
[siren wailing in the distance]

33:49.027 --> 33:50.941
- You're obsessed with me.

33:50.985 --> 33:53.161
- We had to see how you're doing
after the surgery.

33:53.205 --> 33:56.295
Well, I had to see.
Nowak's here for your pudding.

33:56.338 --> 33:57.905
[chuckles]

33:57.948 --> 34:01.430
- Thanks for the tough love.
- Any time.

34:02.866 --> 34:04.172
- Did the line hold?

34:04.216 --> 34:05.652
- Long enough for the fire
to change directions.

34:05.695 --> 34:07.958
You saved North House.
[exhales]

34:10.874 --> 34:12.876
- Scars are sexy, right?

34:12.920 --> 34:14.443
- Oh, yeah, totally.

34:14.487 --> 34:17.403
Especially that one right
there, kinda...

34:17.446 --> 34:18.882
looks like Italy.

34:18.926 --> 34:20.449
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

34:21.755 --> 34:24.671
You can ease up on
the daggers, I get it now.

34:24.714 --> 34:26.325
Eric's a literal hero.

34:26.368 --> 34:28.327
That's why you think
I'm not good enough for him.

34:28.370 --> 34:31.373
- I didn't say that.
- Jesus. Really, Nowak?

34:31.417 --> 34:33.680
You've been pretty clear
you don't want me to date him.

34:33.723 --> 34:36.074
- He's not good enough for you.

34:37.075 --> 34:41.122
[upbeat music]

35:13.981 --> 35:19.726
- There's PJs in the top drawer,
and a toothbrush.

35:19.769 --> 35:22.685
- Thanks for letting me crash
here, by the way.

35:22.729 --> 35:24.513
- Hey, it's the least
I could do,

35:24.557 --> 35:25.993
after what you did for Kookoo.

35:26.036 --> 35:29.649
- How long until people
can go back to North House?

35:29.692 --> 35:31.346
- They'll start organizing
flights back up

35:31.390 --> 35:32.956
now that Fire's cleared it,

35:33.000 --> 35:34.697
but it can take a while,

35:34.741 --> 35:36.656
and a lot of people
want to get home sooner.

35:36.699 --> 35:39.093
But you're welcome to stay here
as long as you want.

35:41.835 --> 35:44.185
[door closing]

35:49.712 --> 35:51.758
[Devon]: Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

35:51.801 --> 35:53.455
- Oh, hey! I didn't recognize
the number.

35:53.499 --> 35:54.891
- Oh, the internet's out, Dev.

35:54.935 --> 35:56.806
We've had some really crazy
wildfires.

35:56.850 --> 35:58.982
North House actually had
to be evacuated,

35:59.026 --> 36:00.854
so I'm crashing in Thompson
for a bit.

36:00.897 --> 36:02.943
- Oh, wow. But you're good?

36:02.986 --> 36:04.814
- Honestly,
it was kind of amazing.

36:04.858 --> 36:06.512
There was this woman
and she didn't want to leave,

36:06.555 --> 36:09.254
but then after, I got invited
to sit with some of the women,

36:09.297 --> 36:11.647
and now they're teaching me
how to bead!

36:11.691 --> 36:13.867
- Beading, like...
making earrings?

36:13.910 --> 36:16.565
What are you going to do,
start an Etsy?

36:16.609 --> 36:18.654
[scoffs]

36:18.698 --> 36:21.266
- I should let you go,
you're going to be late.

36:21.309 --> 36:24.225
- Glad you're safe.
Love you, Em.

36:24.269 --> 36:26.488
- Love you too.

36:27.272 --> 36:28.664
[phone beeps]

36:33.103 --> 36:34.540
- You're not going home?

36:34.583 --> 36:37.195
- I didn't want to wake Madison.
She needs sleep.

36:38.283 --> 36:42.417
- Hey, that guy, when we were
evacuating Deep Lake,

36:42.461 --> 36:44.419
he mentioned something
about your mom?

36:45.420 --> 36:47.640
Jolene, is that...?

36:51.426 --> 36:53.994
I'm sorry, that's none
of my business.

36:54.037 --> 36:55.604
- Wait.

36:57.954 --> 36:59.304
[sighs]

37:01.219 --> 37:02.698
My dad was Jamaican.

37:02.742 --> 37:04.178
My mom was from Deep Lake.

37:04.222 --> 37:05.875
That's all I know about
my birth parents.

37:06.963 --> 37:10.445
That, and my mom gave me up
the day after I was born.

37:12.447 --> 37:15.929
So, when I was looking
for places to up my hours,

37:15.972 --> 37:19.019
and I realized Poplar Air was up
here in Thompson, I figured...

37:21.761 --> 37:23.241
Dumb, right?

37:25.852 --> 37:27.419
- Did you find her?

37:27.462 --> 37:30.422
- The band office tried to help,
but I didn't even know her name.

37:31.510 --> 37:35.557
Today's the first time
I've heard it. And...

37:37.037 --> 37:38.473
now that I know,

37:38.517 --> 37:40.649
I'm not even sure what
I'm supposed to do with that.

37:41.476 --> 37:44.653
I can't be like them,
abandoning their child.

37:55.664 --> 37:57.840
- You should go home, Bodie.

37:57.884 --> 37:59.625
Madison needs you.

38:07.546 --> 38:08.373
And, uh...

38:08.982 --> 38:10.853
You know, maybe...

38:12.725 --> 38:15.249
...take her out
on a date sometime.

38:26.695 --> 38:28.523
- Have you slept?

38:29.002 --> 38:31.134
- I heard med school
can be tiring.

38:31.178 --> 38:32.701
Might as well get used to it.

38:33.572 --> 38:35.965
And I wanted to check on Wayne.

38:36.009 --> 38:38.316
- He's stable.
You saved his life.

38:40.056 --> 38:42.581
- Look, I know I overstepped.

38:42.624 --> 38:46.802
- You did. But I'm partly
also responsible.

38:46.846 --> 38:49.065
I showed you how to intubate.

38:49.109 --> 38:51.851
I forget sometimes that
you're not in med school yet.

38:51.894 --> 38:54.984
- I like that you're pushing me.
- It's not because I like you.

38:55.768 --> 38:56.986
- Good to know.

38:57.030 --> 38:58.945
[chuckles]

38:58.988 --> 39:00.860
- I do care about you, Crystal.

39:00.903 --> 39:03.036
But the reason I push you

39:03.079 --> 39:05.081
is because you're incredibly
talented.

39:10.652 --> 39:12.132
- Ms. Highway?

39:12.175 --> 39:13.699
I'm sorry we didn't get
the chance to talk yesterday.

39:13.742 --> 39:15.788
I was hoping you could spare
me a few minutes now.

39:15.831 --> 39:18.225
- It's not a great time.
- Just a few questions.

39:18.268 --> 39:20.575
You and Jeremy Wood
grew up together.

39:20.619 --> 39:24.405
Would you say you were close?
- I wouldn't. Not anymore.

39:24.449 --> 39:27.408
- Hmm. I understand
you're studying to be
a nurse practitioner.

39:27.452 --> 39:29.671
So you'll be able to write
prescriptions soon?

39:29.715 --> 39:31.673
- What's this got to do
with the crash?

39:31.717 --> 39:35.111
- I know what Jeremy is doing,
what he's bringing up here.

39:35.155 --> 39:38.245
- Okay, yeah. He brings things
into the community.

39:38.288 --> 39:41.509
Alcohol is not illegal.
- Dealing Oxy is.

39:42.815 --> 39:45.818
Call me if you think of anything
that might be relevant.

39:51.780 --> 39:53.782
- Jesus, Jeremy.

39:55.218 --> 39:56.655
- Wheezer.

39:59.571 --> 40:03.226
Man, you leaving?
- You just missed Pierce.

40:05.968 --> 40:08.536
Guess who's not responsible
for the crash?

40:08.580 --> 40:09.929
[laughing]
- No shit.

40:09.972 --> 40:11.452
- Yeah, the plane was
overloaded,

40:11.496 --> 40:13.236
the cargo straps weren't
secured properly.

40:13.280 --> 40:15.369
Poplar Air, they're gonna
take a hit on a load fine,

40:15.413 --> 40:17.719
but it's no pilot error.
- I knew it!

40:17.763 --> 40:19.591
I knew they couldn't keep
a good driver down.

40:19.634 --> 40:22.071
When are you back?
- Soon as I ditch the sticks.

40:22.115 --> 40:23.899
Just figured I should probably
re-stake my claim

40:23.943 --> 40:26.162
before some dumb greenhorn
tries to scoop it.

40:26.206 --> 40:27.642
Hey, would you look at that?

40:28.600 --> 40:30.428
That's my lucky sock.

40:30.471 --> 40:31.907
- I didn't know
you had a lucky sock.

40:31.951 --> 40:34.257
- Well, anything I wasn't
wearing during the crash

40:34.301 --> 40:35.607
is lucky.

40:35.650 --> 40:37.173
[laughing]

40:37.217 --> 40:39.437
- Glad to have you back, man.
It, um...

40:39.480 --> 40:41.613
It wasn't the same without you
around here.

40:41.656 --> 40:43.092
You miss it?

40:43.876 --> 40:45.791
- Honestly?

40:45.834 --> 40:48.663
I'm just glad to be home with
Lynn and the kids.

40:48.707 --> 40:51.405
I used to think that flying
was my life.

40:52.667 --> 40:56.062
But I think there's more
important things to live for,
you know?

40:56.845 --> 41:00.675
[soft music]

41:02.851 --> 41:07.682
- There's the head,
and here are the baby's feet.

41:08.117 --> 41:09.641
- They're huge.

41:09.684 --> 41:11.425
- I'm sure they get that
from you.

41:11.469 --> 41:12.818
[laughing]

41:19.172 --> 41:21.043
[heart beating softly]

41:23.742 --> 41:25.874
- That's our baby.

41:43.109 --> 41:44.806
- I couldn't let them hang it
on Wheezer.

41:44.850 --> 41:48.157
- Yeah, sure, you, uh...
did what you had to do.

41:48.201 --> 41:50.420
- Yeah. And I'm keeping my job.

41:50.464 --> 41:52.771
- Cool. So am I.

41:52.814 --> 41:54.512
Two-week suspension.

41:54.555 --> 41:56.688
With pay.
[laughing]

41:56.731 --> 42:00.343
Turns out it's real hard to find
good Lead Hands around here.

42:00.909 --> 42:02.432
See ya around!

42:04.086 --> 42:05.914
[sighs]

42:10.571 --> 42:12.965
- Get some sleep?
- Barely.

42:13.008 --> 42:15.968
You know, I don't think I'll
ever get used to shift work.

42:16.011 --> 42:17.970
What are you working on?

42:18.013 --> 42:20.755
- Some women from North House
are teaching me.

42:21.103 --> 42:23.715
I know, it's, um...
It's a little bit rough.

42:23.758 --> 42:25.194
- Yeah, that is not good.

42:26.544 --> 42:28.284
[chuckles]

42:29.677 --> 42:31.636
It's pretty cool
you're learning, though.

42:31.679 --> 42:35.640
That's a big deal, getting
included in something like that.

42:36.815 --> 42:38.991
[birds chirping]

42:45.214 --> 42:46.476
Oh.

42:57.966 --> 43:00.926
- I'm sorry. I can't be doing
this. I have a fiancé.

43:00.969 --> 43:03.798
- Right. Yeah, yeah, of course.

43:08.150 --> 43:10.762
[breathing heavily]

43:12.415 --> 43:13.852
- Oh crap.

43:14.896 --> 43:16.332
Subtitling: difuze
