incredibly rare species

00:08.405 --> 00:09.638
of abnormal spider

00:09.639 --> 00:12.208
that requires a warm-blooded
host to survive.

00:12.209 --> 00:15.544
It is a subspecies offshoot
of a marine-dwelling abnormal

00:15.545 --> 00:17.746

00:17.747 --> 00:20.549

who makes the earth move.

00:20.550 --> 00:21.784
And the waters rise.

00:21.785 --> 00:24.320
They may well have a chemical
or even psychic bond

00:24.321 --> 00:27.423
that allows the host a deeper
connection to Big Bertha.

00:27.424 --> 00:30.359
[Will]: Kali. That's the woman
of my visions.

00:30.360 --> 00:31.627

00:31.628 --> 00:32.728
You killed her
four years ago, yes?

00:32.729 --> 00:34.363
Not exactly.

00:34.364 --> 00:36.332
You kept her alive
and lied about it?

00:36.333 --> 00:38.934
Historically, creatures
as powerful as Big Bertha

00:38.935 --> 00:40.469
have a symbiotic relationship

00:40.470 --> 00:42.471
with other lifeforms
on this planet.

00:42.472 --> 00:44.273
I felt that euthanizing her

00:44.274 --> 00:45.541
would create
far greater problems.

00:45.542 --> 00:47.676
We need to initiate an immediate

Go to hell.

11:20.726 --> 11:23.528
Look, I'm not asking
you to forget Magnus

11:23.529 --> 11:26.064
or trample on her
memory in any way,

11:26.065 --> 11:29.467
but there's millions of lives
at stake here.

11:44.717 --> 11:47.652
No injuries to report.
Damage was minimal,

11:47.653 --> 11:48.987
but we did take on
a lot of water.

11:48.988 --> 11:51.489
Luckily, we rode
the wave bow-on.

11:51.490 --> 11:53.625
I put the old woman in a
stateroom to calm her down.

11:53.626 --> 11:54.659
Yeah, good luck with that.

11:57.396 --> 11:58.696
Mr. Forsythe,
I have to ask--

11:58.697 --> 11:59.931
what do you want
us to do now?

11:59.932 --> 12:02.967
Now?

12:02.968 --> 12:05.670
There is no "now,"
thanks to Magnus.

12:06.939 --> 12:08.573
Sir? You okay?

12:08.574 --> 12:12.777
No. I'm not.

12:22.621 --> 12:23.455
Nothing.

12:25.458 --> 12:27.425
Keep trying.

12:32.465 --> 12:34.032
No, no, no, no, no.
We have no time for this.

12:34.033 --> 12:36.701
Come on, we need to go.
We need to go over there.

12:36.702 --> 12:38.636
It's okay.

12:38.637 --> 12:40.772
Come on. Come on, everyone.

12:48.047 --> 12:49.614
[Sirens wail]

12:49.615 --> 12:53.718
Come on. Jaldi. Keep going.

13:08.634 --> 13:10.635
Jaldi. Jaldi.

13:10.636 --> 13:12.003
Kate.

13:12.004 --> 13:13.571
[Ravi]:
The wave is very close.

13:13.572 --> 13:14.906
You need to get back here.

13:14.907 --> 13:16.341
[Kate]: I can't.
We're not done here.

13:16.342 --> 13:18.710
Kate, listen to me.
There's no time.

13:18.711 --> 13:19.844
Janu!

13:19.845 --> 13:22.547
Janu! Janu!

13:22.548 --> 13:23.548
Look, I gotta go.

13:23.549 --> 13:24.415
Wait, Kate--

13:24.416 --> 13:26.584
I'll be fine.

13:26.585 --> 13:27.418
What's going on?

13:32.424 --> 13:36.394
Okay. [Speaking Hindi]

13:36.395 --> 13:37.395
It's fine. I'll find him.

13:37.396 --> 13:39.063
I'll find him.

13:39.064 --> 13:42.000
Come on, go.
Everyone, go!

13:42.001 --> 13:43.001
I'll find him.

13:43.002 --> 13:44.969
Janu!

13:46.805 --> 13:48.673
Janu!

13:50.209 --> 13:51.075
[Coughing]

13:53.879 --> 13:54.879
Oh, no, no, no, no.

13:54.880 --> 13:56.181
No, you guys can't be here.

13:56.182 --> 13:58.016
We need to go, now.
Come on.

14:07.426 --> 14:08.693
Come on!

14:15.467 --> 14:17.035
Come on.

14:17.036 --> 14:19.437
Come on!

14:19.438 --> 14:20.972
[Crashing, screaming]

14:22.808 --> 14:23.908
Run!

14:34.111 --> 14:36.212
Aw, satyanash.

14:36.213 --> 14:37.313
What happened?

14:37.314 --> 14:38.648
The wave just took out Dharavi.

14:38.649 --> 14:41.317
I can't reach Kate.

14:52.430 --> 14:55.198
That's funny, I thought I said
I wasn't to be disturbed.

14:55.199 --> 14:56.633
Sorry, sir.

14:56.634 --> 14:58.101
But there's something
you need to see.

14:58.102 --> 14:59.936
Yeah, I highly doubt that.

14:59.937 --> 15:02.072
In fact, I've pretty much seen
everything I need to see

15:02.073 --> 15:04.908
for the rest of my life.

15:04.909 --> 15:08.878
You're gonna want
to come for this.

15:10.581 --> 15:11.848
Ooh, can I guess?

15:11.849 --> 15:14.050
Is a giant squid
attacking the ship?

15:14.051 --> 15:16.786
Does Gisele Bundchen
want my phone number?

15:16.787 --> 15:19.122
Did Grimsby win the FA Cup?

15:21.158 --> 15:23.693
We just fished her
out of the water.

15:25.629 --> 15:27.964
Well, I'll be damned.

15:35.072 --> 15:36.573
What the hell is this?

15:36.574 --> 15:38.641
Mr. Foss, I asked you
to fix the computers,

15:38.642 --> 15:40.376
not ship them home
piece by piece.

15:40.377 --> 15:41.377
I hate to break it to you.

15:41.378 --> 15:43.179
When a giant spider
fries your system,

15:43.180 --> 15:44.714
it takes a little more
than "control-alt-delete"

15:44.715 --> 15:45.949
to get things running again.

15:45.950 --> 15:47.217
I hope you understand

15:47.218 --> 15:47.851
if we don't
track Bertha down

15:47.852 --> 15:48.985
and neutralize her--

15:48.986 --> 15:50.253
Yeah, I know, the
whole world will end,

15:50.254 --> 15:51.821
cats will rule the
Earth, I get it.

15:51.822 --> 15:53.757
You gave me the sales
pitch already.

15:53.758 --> 15:57.093
But there's a lot of
damage here, dude.

15:57.094 --> 15:59.963
I want this mess
fixed in an hour.

15:59.964 --> 16:02.766
You get me, dude?

16:05.302 --> 16:06.770
[Sotto]: Jackass.

16:06.771 --> 16:08.671
[Coughing]

16:08.672 --> 16:11.141
[Sirens wail]

16:12.710 --> 16:15.311
You okay? Yeah?

16:18.883 --> 16:21.184
Get up.

16:25.890 --> 16:28.057
[Kate]: Hey, I told you
I'd be fine.

16:28.058 --> 16:29.058
Don't do that again.

16:29.059 --> 16:29.893
How bad is it?

16:29.894 --> 16:34.898
[Alarms wailing]

16:54.051 --> 16:58.354
It's Darjeeling summer tea.

16:58.355 --> 17:00.957
They say it gets its taste
from the Himalayan breeze

17:00.958 --> 17:03.827
that cools the valley
where it grows.

17:05.695 --> 17:06.796
Not impressed?

17:08.732 --> 17:10.133
I have to say

17:10.134 --> 17:13.837
I am so honored to
be here with you.

17:13.838 --> 17:14.771
I'm such a fan.

17:14.771 --> 17:16.973
I've been a fan
of yours

17:16.973 --> 17:18.308
for a long, long time,

17:18.309 --> 17:20.844
ever since I heard that speech
you did in Maldives

17:20.845 --> 17:23.780
about the new genus of bakunawa.

17:27.284 --> 17:28.117
Really?

17:31.755 --> 17:33.423
Why? Why do I even
hire these guys?

17:33.424 --> 17:36.426
This is not a social call.

17:36.427 --> 17:39.229
I appreciate you saving my life,

17:39.230 --> 17:40.864
but your utter recklessness

17:40.865 --> 17:42.832
has caused unimaginable
pain and suffering

17:42.833 --> 17:44.234
to the people of this region,

17:44.235 --> 17:46.469
and it promises to do much worse
before this is over.

17:47.504 --> 17:48.771
Are you gonna kill me?

17:48.772 --> 17:50.740
No.

17:50.741 --> 17:53.710
You are going to communicate
with Bertha

17:53.711 --> 17:55.378
and convince her
to stop these waves.

17:55.379 --> 17:57.213
Yeah, I can't do that.

17:57.214 --> 17:59.816
No, really.

17:59.817 --> 18:01.150
I can't do it.

18:01.151 --> 18:02.785
Why not?

18:02.786 --> 18:03.720
Same reason as I don't
really give a crap

18:03.721 --> 18:06.356
about that gun being in my face.

18:15.466 --> 18:17.000
The Makri.

18:17.001 --> 18:20.270
Yeah. It died
about an hour ago.

18:20.271 --> 18:23.940
Apparently these rare
form of arachnid species

18:23.941 --> 18:25.742
has a low tolerance
for stress.

18:25.743 --> 18:30.179
And, of course,
as its former host,

18:30.180 --> 18:31.314
I'm a dead man as well.

18:33.117 --> 18:36.486
So, sorry, but without him,

18:36.487 --> 18:38.755
I can't connect to Bertha
any more than you can.

18:42.259 --> 18:43.526
[Ravi]: We were lucky.

18:43.527 --> 18:44.794
Most of the residents

18:44.795 --> 18:46.296
were able to get
to high ground in time.

18:46.297 --> 18:48.998
If it hadn't been
for Dr. Magnus's warning,

18:48.999 --> 18:51.501
things would have
been much worse.

18:51.502 --> 18:52.735
What's the news on
the other waves?

18:52.736 --> 18:54.270
None good, I'm afraid.

18:54.271 --> 18:57.974
ESA satellite imagery indicates
both have increased in size,

18:57.975 --> 19:01.277
no doubt as a result of passing
through shallow water.

19:01.278 --> 19:06.916
This is the projected fallout
once they make landfall.

19:06.917 --> 19:10.053
Evacuations are proceeding
in Salalah and Karachi,

19:10.054 --> 19:13.389
but there's no way we can
clear the entire area in time.

19:13.390 --> 19:14.891
In other words...

19:14.892 --> 19:17.760
We need
a bloody miracle.

19:28.906 --> 19:30.773
Bibi!

19:30.774 --> 19:33.209
So nice of you to
have joined us.

19:33.210 --> 19:35.078
Haven't you done enough?

19:35.079 --> 19:36.813
Troublesome
Kali cult member,

19:36.814 --> 19:38.114
meet Dr. Helen Magnus.

19:40.384 --> 19:42.986
From the Sanctuary?

19:42.987 --> 19:44.120
Cha Kali maki.

19:44.121 --> 19:45.054
Cha Kali maki.

19:45.055 --> 19:46.422
You guys know each other?

19:46.423 --> 19:47.824
She is well known
among my people

19:47.825 --> 19:49.459
for protecting the special
creatures of the Earth.

19:49.460 --> 19:51.294
I'm so sorry

19:51.295 --> 19:53.262
about
what happened to the Makri.

19:53.263 --> 19:54.464
Your people have done
a remarkable job

19:54.465 --> 19:55.398
of keeping it safe.

19:55.399 --> 19:57.266
It wasn't your fault.

19:57.267 --> 19:59.602
It was the fault
of this [Hindi epithet].

19:59.603 --> 20:00.737
Ouch, Bibi.

20:00.738 --> 20:03.940
We need to get
in contact with Kali.

20:03.941 --> 20:05.174
Is their a way we can do that
without the Makri?

20:05.175 --> 20:07.377
You wish her to help
stop the destruction.

20:07.378 --> 20:08.511
I believe it's still possible.

20:08.512 --> 20:09.979
With Kali,

20:09.980 --> 20:11.347
anything is possible.

20:11.348 --> 20:13.149
But only if

20:13.150 --> 20:14.917
her true host pleases her.

20:14.918 --> 20:16.386
If there is no Makri,

20:16.387 --> 20:18.621
then he must dance
the Rapati Sungu.

20:18.622 --> 20:22.091
Yes, we tried that already,
and it worked at first,

20:22.092 --> 20:24.193
but one of my own
people interfered,

20:24.194 --> 20:25.328
and the connection
was lost.

20:27.297 --> 20:29.599
Please, is there anything else?

20:43.147 --> 20:44.180
Magnus?

20:44.181 --> 20:45.615
Hello, Will.

20:45.616 --> 20:47.917
How did you...?

20:47.918 --> 20:48.851
Where are you?

20:48.852 --> 20:50.920
I'll explain later.

20:50.921 --> 20:52.555
Listen, I've just found out
that there may be a way

20:52.556 --> 20:54.057
to restore communication
with Kali.

20:54.058 --> 20:55.591
That's great. How?

20:55.592 --> 20:58.294
There is a belief
amongst the members of the cult

20:58.295 --> 21:00.163
that Kali will appear
to a former host

21:00.164 --> 21:01.264
one final time,

21:01.265 --> 21:03.433
at the gates
to the spirit realm.

21:07.071 --> 21:08.304
Spirit realm?
As in...

21:08.305 --> 21:10.573
I'm afraid so.

21:10.574 --> 21:14.977
In order to talk to Kali,
you have to die.

21:24.590 --> 21:25.657
You're kidding, right?

21:25.658 --> 21:29.328
Since when do we trade
on blind faith?

21:29.329 --> 21:31.997
And even if it's true,
Kali may not listen,

21:31.998 --> 21:33.332
or she may not be able
to stop the waves.

21:33.333 --> 21:34.166
Give me a minute?

21:34.167 --> 21:35.634
Of course.

21:35.635 --> 21:37.703
Tell me you're not
seriously considering this.

21:37.704 --> 21:41.540
Just...give me the room.

21:51.551 --> 21:54.086
How sure are you about this?

21:54.087 --> 21:55.620
Not very.

21:55.621 --> 21:56.722
Like all beliefs,

21:56.723 --> 21:57.823
it comes down
to a leap of faith.

21:57.824 --> 22:00.559
We do know that Bertha
shares some connectivity

22:00.560 --> 22:02.027
with the rest of the world.

22:02.028 --> 22:03.495
We've seen evidence of this

22:03.496 --> 22:05.297
in the abnormals
that reacted to her outbursts,

22:05.298 --> 22:07.666
but whether or not
she can control the waves

22:07.667 --> 22:08.734
is anyone's guess.

22:11.070 --> 22:12.037
Walk me through it.

22:12.038 --> 22:13.572
We induce cardiac arrest,

22:13.573 --> 22:15.507
but continue to monitor
your brain activity

22:15.508 --> 22:19.311
so we can revive you.

22:19.312 --> 22:20.145
What if it doesn't work?

22:20.146 --> 22:21.213
It will.

22:21.214 --> 22:23.081
No..

22:24.517 --> 22:26.351
I mean what if
it's not long enough?

22:28.354 --> 22:31.990
I'm just saying,
I'm dead anyway.

22:31.991 --> 22:34.025
Once the Makri leaves the host,
the host dies.

22:34.026 --> 22:36.294
Those are the rules.

22:36.295 --> 22:37.863
So what exactly
am I coming back for?

22:37.864 --> 22:40.132
Because I'm not prepared to
give up on you that easily.

22:40.133 --> 22:42.033
Magnus--

22:42.034 --> 22:43.335
the decision to do
this may be yours,

22:43.336 --> 22:46.505
but the decision about how far
to take it is absolutely mine.

22:46.506 --> 22:47.439
No argument, Will.

23:09.028 --> 23:10.595
Mr. Foss?

23:12.131 --> 23:13.265
How are we doing here?

23:13.266 --> 23:14.199
Well, I've managed
to reconnect

23:14.200 --> 21:34.571
with Navstar,

23:15.268 --> 23:16.268
but the readings are all wrong.

23:16.269 --> 23:17.436
According to this,

23:17.437 --> 23:18.403
we're sailing
through the Arctic.

23:18.404 --> 23:20.071
This is taking too long.

23:20.072 --> 23:21.773
Well, I'm working
as fast as I can.

23:21.774 --> 23:23.341
Somehow I don't believe you.

23:23.342 --> 23:26.077
Sir? We have an incoming
transmission for you.

23:26.078 --> 23:28.547
An unknown source.

23:35.221 --> 23:36.021
Helen?

23:36.022 --> 23:37.222
Doc!

23:37.223 --> 23:38.590
Hello, Terence. Henry.

23:38.591 --> 23:39.691
You're alive.

23:39.692 --> 23:41.793
Sorry to burst your bubble.

23:41.794 --> 23:42.928
That's not fair, Helen.

23:42.929 --> 23:45.197
I know
we've had our differences,

23:45.198 --> 23:47.499
but I've always had
the utmost respect for you,

23:47.500 --> 23:49.334
the best interests
of the Sanctuary at heart.

23:49.335 --> 23:52.437
Good. Then pay attention.

23:52.438 --> 23:55.173
We think we've found a way
for Will to reconnect with Kali.

23:55.174 --> 23:56.608
He's going to attempt
to convince her

23:56.609 --> 23:57.576
to stop the waves.

23:57.577 --> 23:58.443
How?

23:58.444 --> 23:59.744
We don't know yet,

23:59.745 --> 24:01.079
but if he can reason with her--

24:01.080 --> 24:02.214
Reason with her?

24:02.215 --> 24:03.448
And if I'm right about
her interconnectedness

24:03.449 --> 24:05.050
to other life forms--

24:05.051 --> 24:06.251
Helen, are you
listening to yourself?

24:06.252 --> 24:07.152
All I'm asking for

24:07.153 --> 24:08.787
is a bit of time,
Terence.

24:08.788 --> 24:10.155
Bertha isn't a threat
at the moment.

24:10.156 --> 24:11.389
According to who?

24:11.390 --> 24:13.258
If you attack her,
as you did before,

24:13.259 --> 24:15.660
you will not only
put Will's life in danger,

24:15.661 --> 24:16.761
but you risk angering her again.

24:16.762 --> 24:17.729
We've been through this.

24:17.730 --> 24:19.331
My orders,

24:19.332 --> 24:21.299
as given to me by the heads
of the Sanctuary Network,

24:21.300 --> 24:24.302
are to eliminate Bertha.

24:24.303 --> 24:26.605
Now if you're smart,
you'll stay out of my way.

24:26.606 --> 24:28.039
I can't do that, Terence.

24:28.040 --> 24:29.508
There's too much at stake.

24:29.509 --> 24:31.810
Then I can't
guarantee your safety.

24:33.145 --> 24:34.779
I'm sorry it's come to this,
Helen.

24:34.780 --> 24:38.517
And yet, here we are.

24:41.087 --> 24:41.920
She's on a ship nearby.

24:41.921 --> 24:44.356
Find out which one.

24:44.357 --> 24:45.323
Right away, sir.

24:45.324 --> 24:47.392
Mr. Foss, step away
from the console.

24:47.393 --> 24:48.727
What?

24:48.728 --> 24:50.362
I will not have you
sabotage my efforts

24:50.363 --> 24:52.163
now that you know
Magnus is alive.

25:01.073 --> 25:02.340
Take him to a secure room.

25:02.341 --> 25:04.543
Dude, that is gross!

25:04.544 --> 25:06.077
Ow!

25:10.750 --> 25:11.583
Dammit!

25:11.584 --> 25:13.151
I told you.

25:13.152 --> 25:15.153
That last magnetic burst
completely wiped our systems.

25:15.154 --> 25:16.688
Let me widen
the parameters,

25:16.689 --> 25:18.490
run it again.

25:18.491 --> 25:19.758
Thank you, Charles.

25:19.759 --> 25:22.394
Charles?
I thought your name was Carl.

25:22.395 --> 25:23.428
Charles.

25:23.429 --> 25:25.163
You know,
you could help,

25:25.164 --> 25:27.365
instead of lounging around
like a frat boy.

25:27.366 --> 25:28.700
I gave you Carl,
didn't I?

25:28.701 --> 25:29.568
Charles.

25:29.569 --> 25:30.769
Anyway,
why should I care?

25:30.770 --> 25:33.371
My days are numbered in hours.

25:33.372 --> 25:35.607
If Wexford finds Bertha
before we do,

25:35.608 --> 25:37.742
it'll ruin any chance we have
of stopping those waves.

25:37.743 --> 25:39.244
Not to mention
what she'll do

25:39.245 --> 25:41.580
if he attacks again.

25:41.581 --> 25:43.281
Not really my problem, is it?

25:43.282 --> 25:44.716
But it's a wonder
to see you work.

25:52.258 --> 25:53.558
Could you pass me my ball,
please?

26:04.670 --> 26:05.804
For the record,

26:05.805 --> 26:08.373
I still
think this is a crazy idea.

26:08.374 --> 26:09.641
Most ancient myths

26:09.642 --> 26:12.711
are designed
to freak people out.

26:12.712 --> 26:14.179
In the bottom drawer
of my desk,

26:14.180 --> 26:15.113
there's an envelope.

26:15.114 --> 26:17.349
I wrote some things
down, and--

26:17.350 --> 26:19.618
No.

26:19.619 --> 26:20.919
No, no way.

26:20.920 --> 26:21.586
We are not having
this conversation.

26:21.587 --> 26:22.754
Yes, we are.

26:22.755 --> 26:24.823
Because nothing's
gonna happen.

26:28.894 --> 26:30.128
Yes, it is.

26:30.129 --> 26:31.830
Look,

26:31.831 --> 26:35.300
I don't give a crap about
your "last requests," okay?

26:35.301 --> 26:36.768
And if that
pisses you off,

26:36.769 --> 26:38.269
then you're welcome
to cross my name

26:38.270 --> 26:39.537
off of whatever is in
that envelope

26:39.538 --> 26:41.206
when you get back.

26:44.176 --> 26:46.177
Do you got it?

26:48.347 --> 26:49.714
Yep.

26:56.689 --> 26:58.523
Thanks, you guys.

26:58.524 --> 27:00.425
I know, rock and
a hard place, right?

27:00.426 --> 27:01.660
Go ahead.
Do your jobs.

27:01.661 --> 27:03.528
I'm fine.

27:30.322 --> 27:31.923
Dr. Magnus, I'm receiving
an incoming data stream.

27:31.924 --> 27:34.225
What does it say?

27:34.226 --> 27:35.326
It's a simple
binary code.

27:35.327 --> 27:37.195
What do you suppose that means?

27:40.499 --> 27:41.433
They're coordinates.

27:41.434 --> 27:42.901
What for? Who sent them?

27:42.902 --> 27:43.868
Henry.

27:43.869 --> 27:46.705
He's giving us
Bertha's location.

27:52.878 --> 27:53.845
Plot a course.

27:57.416 --> 27:59.718
I think we're
ready to go.

27:59.719 --> 28:01.186
You sure you wanna
go through with this?

28:01.187 --> 28:03.188
Oh, yeah.

28:03.189 --> 28:04.923
Today is a good day to die.

28:07.860 --> 28:09.194
Okay.

28:09.195 --> 28:10.161
This is going to hurt a lot
while you're conscious.

28:10.162 --> 28:11.629
Do it quickly, then.

28:13.833 --> 28:16.167
Charging to 150.

28:17.536 --> 28:18.369
Clear!

28:26.946 --> 28:28.213
Charging to 200.

28:28.214 --> 28:29.781
Clear!

28:33.786 --> 28:36.287
[Flatlining]

28:57.877 --> 28:59.344
Asystole.

28:59.345 --> 29:00.445
Start the clock.

29:00.446 --> 29:01.246
How long until
we bring him back?

29:01.247 --> 29:02.881
Five minutes.

29:02.882 --> 29:03.948
Max.

29:20.666 --> 29:22.534
Kali.

29:49.762 --> 29:52.797
[Flatlining]

29:52.798 --> 29:54.632
Kate. How much time?

29:54.633 --> 29:55.834
Three minutes,
six seconds.

30:01.440 --> 30:02.640
How do I get across?

30:26.398 --> 30:27.699
Leap of faith.

30:33.906 --> 30:36.808
Okay.

30:36.809 --> 30:38.776
Leap of faith.

30:56.395 --> 30:57.762
Four and a half minutes.
Let's get him back out.

30:57.763 --> 30:59.564
No argument from me.

31:03.502 --> 31:05.370
Charging to 300.

31:06.672 --> 31:08.473
Clear!

31:15.581 --> 31:17.348
Ravi...

31:17.349 --> 31:21.019
Charging to 360.

31:21.020 --> 31:22.053
Clear!

31:41.407 --> 31:43.508
You are a loyal host, Durga.

31:52.761 --> 31:54.562
Captain, we have a problem.

31:54.563 --> 31:55.563
It t looks like someone
was transmitting

31:55.564 --> 31:56.797
some sort of rudimentary code

31:56.798 --> 31:59.300
through our
communications array.

31:59.301 --> 32:01.535
That son of a bitch.
It's Foss.

32:01.536 --> 32:03.671
He transmitted Bertha's
location to Magnus.

32:03.672 --> 32:05.272
Plot that course
immediately.

32:05.273 --> 32:06.307
We need to catch up to her.

32:06.308 --> 32:09.410
Sir.

32:09.411 --> 32:11.479
He's not responding.
Starting compressions.

32:11.480 --> 32:12.680
Bag him!

32:12.681 --> 32:15.683
Take this bag
and squeeze it into his lungs.

32:15.684 --> 32:17.818
One, two, three, four, bag.

32:17.819 --> 32:20.721
One, two, three, four.
Bag.

32:20.722 --> 32:22.156
Come on, Will.

32:25.093 --> 32:26.760
What is this place?

32:26.761 --> 32:29.129
It is very special.

32:29.130 --> 32:32.733
Only a select few
are allowed inside.

32:32.734 --> 32:33.701
Who are they?

32:33.702 --> 32:35.569
So many questions, Durga!

32:35.570 --> 32:38.138
Is that why you came to see me?

32:38.139 --> 32:40.107
No.

32:40.108 --> 32:42.376
I came to ask for your help.

32:42.377 --> 32:43.544
For your mercy.

32:43.545 --> 32:46.580
[Kali]:
You wish me to stop the waves.

32:46.581 --> 32:48.315
Yes.

32:48.316 --> 32:49.416
Can you do that?

32:49.417 --> 32:51.285
Mmm...

32:51.286 --> 32:54.188
Perhaps.

32:54.189 --> 32:55.523
But why should I?

32:55.524 --> 32:57.324
Because millions
of people will die.

32:57.325 --> 32:58.425
My people.

32:58.426 --> 32:59.660
Your people attacked me.

32:59.661 --> 33:01.395
Only some of them.

33:01.396 --> 33:02.530
The ones who don't
understand you.

33:02.531 --> 33:04.632
And you understand me, Durga?

33:04.633 --> 33:09.069
No, not completely.

33:09.070 --> 33:10.638
I didn't even know
who you were

33:10.639 --> 33:11.839
until recently.

33:11.840 --> 33:14.174
But now that I do,

33:14.175 --> 33:16.844
I see how deeply connected
you are to my world.

33:16.845 --> 33:21.181
You communicate
with many things,

33:21.182 --> 33:22.850
and we must learn
to communicate with you,

33:22.851 --> 33:26.854
but right now, many lives
are in your hands.

33:26.855 --> 33:28.389
Please, Kali.

33:28.390 --> 33:30.424
To show mercy
means nothing to you,

33:30.425 --> 33:32.626
but it will mean everything
to us.

33:34.396 --> 33:36.630
[Flatlining]

33:36.631 --> 33:37.631
How much time?

33:39.634 --> 33:42.236
Kate, how long?

33:42.237 --> 33:43.470
Eight minutes, 15 seconds.

33:47.275 --> 33:48.375
I'm so sorry.

33:48.376 --> 33:49.743
We can't stop.

33:49.744 --> 33:52.079
But, Kate, he's had
no brain activity

33:52.080 --> 33:53.147
for over eight minutes.

33:53.148 --> 33:55.549
We can not stop! Push!

33:57.385 --> 33:58.252
Push!

34:00.221 --> 34:02.122
Go!

34:07.395 --> 34:08.696
You spoke well,
Durga.

34:08.697 --> 34:11.699
You have served me loyally.

34:11.699 --> 34:14.501
I will attempt
to grant you your wish.

34:16.304 --> 34:17.338
Thank you.

34:33.455 --> 34:35.723
We're approaching
the coordinates.

34:35.724 --> 34:38.759
I'm picking up another
magnetic disturbance.

34:38.760 --> 34:39.693
I know.

34:39.694 --> 34:41.161
What on earth is she doing?

34:46.201 --> 34:48.502
We've got company.

34:58.947 --> 34:59.780
It's the Sanctuary ship.

34:59.781 --> 35:01.548
Get her on the radio.

35:01.549 --> 35:02.583
Aye, sir.

35:02.584 --> 35:04.551
Helen, come in.

35:06.187 --> 35:07.454
This is Magnus.

35:07.455 --> 35:09.223
You need to give way, Helen.

35:09.224 --> 35:10.958
I can't do that,
Terence.

35:10.959 --> 35:12.393
I told you not to interfere.

35:12.394 --> 35:13.360
Arm weapons.

35:15.363 --> 35:16.563
Dr. Magnus?

35:16.564 --> 35:18.799
I'm receiving an
urgent call for you.

35:18.800 --> 35:20.734
Hello?

35:20.735 --> 35:22.202
Just so you know,
I wasn't worried.

35:22.203 --> 35:25.205
It's good to hear your voice,
old friend.

35:25.206 --> 35:26.173
What've you got?

35:26.174 --> 35:27.408
Report out
of Salalah.

35:27.409 --> 35:29.443
The wave bearing down
on the coast of Oman...

35:29.444 --> 35:30.844
Neutralized.

35:30.845 --> 35:32.246
What? How?

35:32.247 --> 35:33.614
Red tide.

35:33.615 --> 35:37.284
Giant algae bloom
stretching the entire coast.

35:37.285 --> 35:40.988
I'm sending you the
satellite image now.

35:40.989 --> 35:41.822
It's amazing.

35:41.823 --> 35:44.591
Hundreds of miles of red algae

35:44.592 --> 35:46.593
would've completely altered
the viscosity of the water.

35:46.594 --> 35:48.929
[Wexford]: Helen, I
have limited patience.

35:48.930 --> 35:50.664
You need to stand down.

35:51.900 --> 35:54.301
I'll get back to you.

35:54.302 --> 35:55.536
Listen.

35:55.537 --> 35:57.604
I'm sending you a report
out of Salalah.

35:57.605 --> 35:59.406
I'm convinced
Bertha did this.

35:59.407 --> 36:00.774
Will's attempt to
communicate with Bertha

36:00.775 --> 36:02.976
was a success!

36:02.977 --> 36:04.144
For all we know, this
could be a coincidence,

36:04.145 --> 36:05.479
or perhaps

36:05.480 --> 36:06.947
the abnormal community
acting independently.

36:06.948 --> 36:08.449
Be reasonable,
Terrence.

36:08.450 --> 36:09.516
All I'm asking for
is a little more time

36:09.517 --> 36:12.352
to allow what's happening
to run its course.

36:12.353 --> 36:13.887
Our scans indicate

36:13.888 --> 36:16.256
that Bertha is generating
magnetic energy as we speak.

36:16.257 --> 36:17.091
The risks are too high.

36:17.092 --> 36:17.925
Terence--

36:17.926 --> 36:19.326
We're done!

36:19.327 --> 36:20.828
You need to clear
the target area immediately,

36:20.829 --> 36:22.262
or you will be fired upon.

36:22.263 --> 36:23.397
Target that ship.

36:25.633 --> 36:26.734
What are we
going to do now?

36:26.735 --> 36:28.102
We stay put.

36:28.103 --> 36:31.004
We need to give her time
to stop the other wave.

36:31.005 --> 36:33.440
We don't all
have to.

36:33.441 --> 36:36.610
It only takes one person
to control the ship,

36:36.611 --> 36:37.444
doesn't it?

36:37.445 --> 36:40.848
And I'm a
dead man, right?

36:40.849 --> 36:43.584
There's a launch below, so
you guys need to get on it.

36:43.585 --> 36:45.586
[Coughing]: Charles,

36:45.587 --> 36:47.688
go and tell everybody else,

36:47.689 --> 36:49.590
and don't forget
about the old woman, all right?

36:49.591 --> 36:52.559
Yes, sir.

36:52.560 --> 36:53.427
You don't have to do this.

36:56.431 --> 36:58.832
'Course I do.

37:00.902 --> 37:02.970
Pangea. That was your plan.

37:02.971 --> 37:05.372
A private colony out here.

37:05.373 --> 37:06.573
Your own Sanctuary.

37:06.574 --> 37:10.244
Bertha
was to be the jewel.

37:10.245 --> 37:11.612
Oh, it was gonna be beautiful.

37:13.648 --> 37:22.689
The island of Dr. Moreau,
but... done properly.

37:22.690 --> 37:25.526
You can't blame me
for dreaming big.

37:25.527 --> 37:27.928
It's a rare quality these days.

37:27.929 --> 37:29.429
Yeah.

37:30.999 --> 37:32.800
Get going, darlin',
before I change my mind.

37:32.801 --> 37:35.803
Thank you, Mr. Forsythe.

37:38.807 --> 37:40.641
Edward.

37:42.544 --> 37:44.778
Edward.

37:59.994 --> 38:01.662
Helen, come in.

38:03.298 --> 38:04.565
Helen!

38:04.566 --> 38:06.700
This is your final warning.

38:06.701 --> 38:08.769
Oh, shut up.

38:08.770 --> 38:10.971
You need to clear
the target area immediately.

38:13.942 --> 38:17.411
This is H.M.S.
I-don't-give-a-crap.

38:17.412 --> 38:20.414
If you happen to be an uptight
amphibian martinet

38:20.415 --> 38:21.415
with a Napoleon complex,

38:21.416 --> 38:23.483
please bugger off.

38:23.484 --> 38:24.952
Otherwise, leave a message
after the tone,

38:24.953 --> 38:27.955
and we'll get back to you
as soon as possible.

38:30.825 --> 38:32.492
Beep!

38:32.493 --> 38:34.728
Fire the missiles.

38:34.729 --> 38:35.629
Sir, that's
a civilian ship.

38:35.630 --> 38:36.496
Do it!

38:36.497 --> 38:37.698
I will not, sir.

38:37.699 --> 38:38.899
Then you're relieved.
Fire the missiles.

38:38.900 --> 38:39.833
Captain--

38:39.834 --> 38:41.134
fire the damn missiles!

38:51.579 --> 38:53.881
Good.

38:53.882 --> 38:56.817
Now, target Bertha,
all batteries.

38:59.053 --> 39:00.120
Craft approaching
starboard.

39:02.457 --> 39:05.692
Get us closer
to the boarding ladder.

39:14.936 --> 39:16.169
Report!

39:16.170 --> 39:17.671
Tactical communication
tower's down.

39:17.672 --> 39:18.505
Targeting system's
offline.

39:18.506 --> 39:19.606
Fire everything.

39:19.607 --> 39:21.041
Sir, we have
no guidance system.

39:21.042 --> 39:23.844
If we fire now, we have no
control of where it goes--

39:23.845 --> 39:24.711
get out of my way!

39:24.712 --> 39:25.545
Sir, no...

39:41.663 --> 39:42.729
Kali!

39:49.871 --> 39:52.472
Still headed for Karachi.

39:52.473 --> 39:54.841
Estimated impact
in three minutes.

39:59.356 --> 40:01.758
Please.
I don't know who you guys are,

40:01.759 --> 40:03.626
but if you're in here with her,
you must be powerful.

40:03.627 --> 40:04.494
Please.

40:04.495 --> 40:05.995
Save her life.

40:05.996 --> 40:10.033
My world depends
on her survival.

40:27.718 --> 40:28.584
Will!

40:28.585 --> 40:29.819
What happened?

40:29.820 --> 40:31.354
Unbelievable.
Get the ice off.

40:35.359 --> 40:36.959
I told you you'd be back.

40:41.665 --> 40:44.133
Stand down, Terrence.

40:44.134 --> 40:46.636
How dare you try
to commandeer this ship?

40:46.637 --> 40:47.770
Arrest her.

40:47.771 --> 40:49.172
I think I speak
for everyone here

40:49.173 --> 40:51.607
when I say
we respectfully refuse.

40:57.514 --> 40:58.548
Look at yourself.

40:58.549 --> 41:00.049
What have you become?

41:03.454 --> 41:05.455
It's over.

41:21.772 --> 41:22.805
Are you getting this?

41:22.806 --> 41:24.073
Earthquakes.

41:24.074 --> 41:25.675
Three of them. Land-based.

41:25.676 --> 41:27.510
At the southern tip of Pakistan.

41:27.511 --> 41:29.779
My good God.

41:46.063 --> 41:47.130
I don't believe it.

41:48.966 --> 41:50.900
Captain, Dr. Magnus,

41:50.901 --> 41:52.768
we're receiving
multiple reports.

41:52.769 --> 41:54.504
The third wave was stopped
by a massive counterwave

41:54.505 --> 41:55.605
30 klicks offshore.

41:55.606 --> 41:56.873
Was it Bertha?

41:56.874 --> 41:58.441
Negative.

41:58.442 --> 41:59.842
She's alive but inactive.

41:59.843 --> 42:01.744
Were we tracking any abnormal
sea life in the area?

42:01.745 --> 42:03.713
No other information.

42:03.714 --> 42:04.747
Just calm seas off Karachi.

42:04.748 --> 42:06.983
Incredible.

42:06.984 --> 42:08.851
Captain, set a course
for Mumbai.

42:08.852 --> 42:10.186
We'll collect the rest
of the lifeboats en route.

42:10.187 --> 42:12.688
Yes, ma'am.

42:24.968 --> 42:26.035
Remarkable.

42:26.036 --> 42:27.537
Whatever happened to
you when you died

42:27.538 --> 42:29.005
must have cured the
effects of the Makri.

42:29.006 --> 42:31.140
And yet you still have
no recollection of it?

42:31.141 --> 42:32.575
Uh-uh.

42:32.576 --> 42:34.777
For all I know, I could have
been chatting with Elvis.

42:34.778 --> 42:36.979
Don't be ridiculous.
Elvis is--

42:39.383 --> 42:40.917
never mind.

42:40.918 --> 42:43.085
I was really hoping
you could shed some light

42:43.086 --> 42:44.754
on those mysterious
earthquakes

42:44.755 --> 42:46.189
that canceled out
the third wave.

42:46.190 --> 42:49.559
I've been going over the data,
but none of it makes any sense.

42:49.560 --> 42:51.527
Their timing
and geographic placement

42:51.528 --> 42:52.862
are far too coincidental

42:52.863 --> 42:54.664
for it to have been
a natural occurrence,

42:54.665 --> 42:55.898
and Bertha was already
down by then.

42:55.899 --> 42:57.567
Which means?

42:57.568 --> 43:01.637
Which means, Will...

43:01.638 --> 43:03.206
I don't know what happened.
