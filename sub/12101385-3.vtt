WEBVTT

00:13.000 --> 00:14.625
The Easttown Police Department

00:14.709 --> 00:18.417
received a call reporting
a dead body in Creedham Creek.

00:19.041 --> 00:20.792
Kenny McMenamin's daughter.

00:22.083 --> 00:23.083
Erin?

00:24.417 --> 00:25.583
We'll find out who did this.

00:25.959 --> 00:29.500
One person did this.
Dylan Hinchey. DJ's father.

00:30.125 --> 00:33.250
Hi, bud! Thanks for bringing him
to see me.

00:33.333 --> 00:35.375
Oh, sure, he was so excited
to come.

00:35.834 --> 00:38.834
I want full custody.
I'm his mom. Not her.

00:39.583 --> 00:41.041
If you got somethin'
you wanna tell me,

00:41.125 --> 00:42.959
-you better do it now.
-I didn't kill her.

00:43.375 --> 00:45.000
I'm gonna start digging
through your life,

00:45.083 --> 00:46.625
and I'm gonna find out
everything.

00:47.875 --> 00:48.959
Drive.

00:50.625 --> 00:52.792
-Hey, Trish.
-Can we talk in private?

00:53.458 --> 00:56.041
There's something
about Erin I wanna tell you.

00:56.125 --> 00:57.125
What is it?

00:57.208 --> 00:59.083
Dylan isn't the baby's
real father.

00:59.166 --> 01:00.125
Walk.

01:00.208 --> 01:01.208
Mr. McManamin, please.

01:01.291 --> 01:02.208
Shut up and walk!

01:02.709 --> 01:05.083
She wouldn't tell me who was,
but I think it's Frank Sheehan.

02:02.083 --> 02:05.000
Decedent
is Erin Catherine McMenamin.

02:05.083 --> 02:08.917
A hundred and nine pounds
and sixty inches in length.

02:09.000 --> 02:13.041
Approximate time of death
between midnight and 2:00 a.m.

02:27.083 --> 02:28.333
I-- I'm sorry, Johnny.

02:28.417 --> 02:29.959
I-- I was so tired last night,
I just...

02:30.041 --> 02:31.417
Hey, Billy, it's not your fault.

02:31.500 --> 02:32.834
He took the fucking gun.

02:33.792 --> 02:35.125
Jesus Christ.

02:35.208 --> 02:37.166
He probably blew
his brains out by now.

02:38.500 --> 02:40.834
No tears, abrasions, ecchymosis.

02:41.458 --> 02:42.625
Any signs of rape?

02:42.709 --> 02:44.333
There's no evidence to suggest

02:44.417 --> 02:45.542
she was sexually assaulted.

02:45.625 --> 02:47.667
No semen was found
inside the body.

02:47.750 --> 02:51.000
No evidence of vaginal
or anal trauma.

02:51.083 --> 02:53.166
The bruises on her body
are consistent,

02:53.250 --> 02:54.667
meaning they appeared
to have happened

02:54.750 --> 02:56.166
all around the same time.

02:56.250 --> 02:58.250
Wait. When she was
ambushed in the woods?

02:58.333 --> 03:01.500
-Or not long after.
-What about the missing finger?

03:01.583 --> 03:03.959
Appears to
have been severed by a bullet.

03:04.041 --> 03:06.375
I sent the fingernails scrapings
out to the lab,

03:06.458 --> 03:07.834
along with the underwear,

03:07.917 --> 03:10.000
but I'm not confident
we'll find much.

03:10.083 --> 03:12.125
What the hell are we doing
out here, anyway?

03:12.208 --> 03:13.750
Graham said
he saw his truck parked

03:13.834 --> 03:15.917
on Edmonds Road late last night.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.166
He's gotta be out here
somewhere.

03:17.250 --> 03:19.458
John. Ken. Ken.

03:21.041 --> 03:22.250
-Hey, Ken!
-Kenny!

03:23.458 --> 03:24.458
Kenny!

03:30.125 --> 03:31.750
What the hell are you doing
down there?

03:34.291 --> 03:35.417
I got him.

03:36.542 --> 03:37.917
I got him, Johnny.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.083
Got who?

03:40.959 --> 03:42.000
Dylan.

03:43.125 --> 03:44.458
I killed that son of a bitch.

03:51.166 --> 03:55.125
If it's not a sexual assault,
why take all of her clothes off?

03:56.417 --> 03:58.333
Maybe they wanted to make
it look like it was.

03:59.458 --> 04:00.625
Could have been
a date gone wrong.

04:00.709 --> 04:02.375
They start to have sex,
she stops it,

04:02.458 --> 04:05.000
-which pisses him off.
-No.

04:05.083 --> 04:07.083
Come on. It was 28 degrees
that night.

04:07.166 --> 04:08.417
Why mess around
in the freezing cold

04:08.500 --> 04:11.000
when you can take it
to the backseat of a warm car?

04:12.417 --> 04:14.041
Right.

04:14.125 --> 04:17.500
So, the ME said she was killed
between 12:00 and 2:00.

04:17.583 --> 04:19.291
There were still kids
out on those woods then,

04:19.375 --> 04:21.041
and we know
no one heard a gunshot.

04:21.125 --> 04:24.917
No. Erin wasn't murdered
out in those woods.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.667
She was killed somewhere else
and her body was dumped there.

04:28.792 --> 04:30.750
-That would explain

04:30.834 --> 04:32.458
why her bike's still missing.

04:32.542 --> 04:33.917
She rode it out of there
that night.

04:35.834 --> 04:36.834
Hey, John.

04:39.166 --> 04:40.166
All right.

04:42.458 --> 04:44.834
All right. I'll-- I'll meet you
at the station.

04:47.166 --> 04:49.792
Knowing
and understanding your rights
as I've explained them,

04:49.875 --> 04:51.500
are you willing
to talk to us today

04:51.583 --> 04:53.041
without an attorney present?

04:55.542 --> 04:57.875
-Yeah.
-All right, Kenny.

04:57.959 --> 05:00.083
Tell us why you've come
to the station today.

05:00.166 --> 05:01.834
Last night,
I picked up Dylan Hinchey

05:01.917 --> 05:05.041
outside of the gas station
on Bridge Street.

05:06.500 --> 05:08.417
I had my gun with me.

05:08.500 --> 05:11.250
I made him drive out
to Leahy Road,

05:11.333 --> 05:12.375
and I, uh...

05:17.208 --> 05:18.375
I shot him.

05:19.417 --> 05:20.542
I killed him.

05:21.792 --> 05:23.041
I killed him...

05:24.709 --> 05:26.333
for killing my little girl.

05:29.041 --> 05:30.542
You didn't kill him, Kenny.

05:32.542 --> 05:34.125
Dylan Hinchey's alive.

05:38.166 --> 05:40.333
The bullet went
through his posterior flank.

05:40.417 --> 05:42.333
Fortunately,
it didn't hit any organs.

05:42.417 --> 05:45.583
So we performed a laminectomy
and removed the bullet.

05:47.750 --> 05:49.542
Is he gonna walk again?

05:50.125 --> 05:51.083
We don't know.

05:51.166 --> 05:52.250
Once he regains consciousness,

05:52.333 --> 05:54.834
we'll begin to evaluate
for any deficits.

05:54.917 --> 05:57.625
Your son is very lucky
that he was brought in.

05:57.709 --> 05:59.083
I don't know
that he would have survived

05:59.166 --> 06:01.667
if he were left out there
much longer.

06:09.709 --> 06:10.667
Siobhan.

06:10.750 --> 06:13.959
Kevin, your sister's
so fucking annoying.

06:14.375 --> 06:15.709
Goddamn.

06:16.667 --> 06:17.875
Get the fuck out of here.

06:17.959 --> 06:19.083
Watch your language.

06:19.166 --> 06:21.041
Oh. 'Cause of the baby?

06:21.125 --> 06:22.417
-Yes.

06:34.458 --> 06:36.709
The first time I realized
my brother was different

06:36.792 --> 06:39.875
was when my mom took us
to see Harry Potter.

06:39.959 --> 06:44.542
Kevin's tics were bad that day.
He started snorting.

06:44.625 --> 06:46.291
The kids in front of us
turned around,

06:46.375 --> 06:49.333
and one of them said,
"Fucking weirdo."

06:50.792 --> 06:51.959
My mom was so embarrassed,

06:52.041 --> 06:53.667
we left
before the trailers ended.

07:01.750 --> 07:03.750
Okay, everyone,
don't forget to get

07:03.834 --> 07:06.000
your documentary edits in
by Friday.

07:06.083 --> 07:08.792
-Thank you. Have a good day.

07:08.875 --> 07:10.500
-Ow! Ow!

07:10.583 --> 07:12.083
Ow! That hurts.

07:12.166 --> 07:13.250
-Ow! Ow!
-No. Come on.

07:13.333 --> 07:14.583
Hey, hey, hey. Come on.

07:14.667 --> 07:18.000
Hold still, all right?
I'm not gonna hurt you.

07:18.959 --> 07:23.125
I spy with my little eye
a ukulele.

07:25.250 --> 07:27.000
-Yes.

07:27.083 --> 07:28.375
One more. Do more.

07:28.458 --> 07:32.959
Uh, I spy
with my little eye a turtle.

07:33.792 --> 07:34.917
-Found him.
-Yes.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.125
His name is Kevin.

07:36.208 --> 07:37.542
-You got it.

07:37.625 --> 07:41.041
Nana said I might need
to live with my mom.

07:47.041 --> 07:50.166
Well, she is so silly.

07:51.250 --> 07:53.792
That's-- that's not gonna
happen, all right?

07:53.875 --> 07:56.125
You're gonna stay
right here with us.

07:56.208 --> 07:57.709
Always. Mom?

07:59.208 --> 08:00.208
All right. Go.

08:00.291 --> 08:02.542
I spy with my little eye...

08:03.709 --> 08:05.625
Window looks pretty great, huh?

08:05.709 --> 08:09.375
Yeah. Ellen Clark's youngest son
came out this morning to fix it.

08:09.458 --> 08:10.834
All right. I'm going to Dad's.

08:10.917 --> 08:12.083
-Bye.
-Bye.

08:15.333 --> 08:16.792
The fuck?
Why are you telling him

08:16.875 --> 08:18.417
he might have to go
live with his mom?

08:18.500 --> 08:20.625
'Cause he might have to
go live with his mom.

08:20.709 --> 08:23.166
Shit, Mom. Jesus fucking Christ.

08:23.250 --> 08:24.291
He's four years old, Mom.

08:24.375 --> 08:25.792
We don't know
what's gonna happen, all right?

08:25.875 --> 08:27.417
Don't be telling him
stuff like that.

08:27.500 --> 08:29.333
He's lived this house
his entire life, Mom.

08:29.417 --> 08:31.125
Which is why
we need to prepare him.

08:31.208 --> 08:32.834
Otherwise he'll feel
like the ground is just

08:32.917 --> 08:34.125
falling out beneath him.

08:34.208 --> 08:36.250
-I called Kathy Dryers today.
-You did what?

08:36.333 --> 08:38.333
She works over at
the Child and Youth Services.

08:38.417 --> 08:39.834
And I thought
that she might be--

08:39.917 --> 08:41.542
I know where Kathy Dryers works.
Why the hell are you
calling her?

08:41.625 --> 08:43.875
Because I wanna find out how
this whole custody thing works.

08:43.959 --> 08:46.166
-But that is not
your place, Mom. All right?
-She told me, Carrie has a--

08:46.250 --> 08:49.333
-a place to stay, and a job...
-It's so fucking out of line
for you to be telling him

08:49.417 --> 08:51.458
-stuff like that, Mom.
-...and she stays clean,
and takes her meds!

08:51.542 --> 08:52.959
She is his mother!

08:55.417 --> 08:59.083
She's the mother.
She'll get custody.

08:59.166 --> 09:02.458
And there's not a damn thing
you or I can do about it.

09:04.500 --> 09:05.667
I'll figure something out.

09:05.750 --> 09:07.041
What's there to figure out?

09:07.125 --> 09:08.333
-Hello?

09:08.417 --> 09:10.000
You're not his guardian,
all right?

09:10.083 --> 09:12.709
-I know that!
You don't have to say that!
-Mom. Stay out of it.

09:12.792 --> 09:13.959
-Hey.
-Understand me?

09:14.041 --> 09:15.083
Hey, hey.

09:15.625 --> 09:16.792
Hey. Hi.

09:18.125 --> 09:20.333
-Want a beer?
-Sure.

09:23.792 --> 09:25.792
Picking up on
a weird energy in here.

09:25.875 --> 09:27.959
Yeah.
It's the energy of betrayal.

09:28.041 --> 09:30.709
Oh, cut it out, Mare.
Jesus Christ.

09:30.792 --> 09:32.458
Can I talk to you for a minute?

09:32.542 --> 09:34.542
That's your cue to fuck off.

09:34.625 --> 09:37.417
-Oh, God. Sorry.
-Good luck.

09:37.500 --> 09:39.959
She's in one of her giant
asshole moods tonight.

09:40.041 --> 09:43.000
-You know what? Fuck you.
-Yeah, fuck you, too.

09:45.417 --> 09:47.917
-My God.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.291
Next time
she goes to church,

09:49.375 --> 09:51.166
I swear to God,
I'm gonna take all of her stuff

09:51.250 --> 09:53.208
and I'm gonna fucking burn it.

09:54.417 --> 09:55.667
What's going on?

09:56.125 --> 09:57.458
Mm...

09:57.542 --> 10:00.750
Jess Riley came over
to the house late last night.

10:00.834 --> 10:02.417
You know, she was Erin's friend.

10:02.500 --> 10:03.709
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

10:03.792 --> 10:09.166
And she told me Dylan Hinchey
isn't DJ's real father.

10:11.625 --> 10:12.959
What?

10:15.166 --> 10:17.083
What? Why would she come to you
with that information,

10:17.166 --> 10:18.125
and not the police?

10:18.208 --> 10:20.083
Well, that's what I asked her,
and she said

10:20.166 --> 10:22.667
she didn't wanna come to you,
because...

10:23.166 --> 10:24.166
What?

10:26.250 --> 10:28.417
...she thinks
the real father is Frank.

10:30.458 --> 10:31.542
Frank?

10:32.959 --> 10:34.709
My Fr-- What?

10:37.000 --> 10:38.667
No, Lor, this--
No way that's...

10:38.750 --> 10:40.250
That's what I said too,
but she said

10:40.333 --> 10:42.208
she saw the two of them
together.

10:42.291 --> 10:45.250
Together? Like, what--
what does that mean?

10:45.333 --> 10:48.458
-How? Lor? I mean--
-Twice at Erin's house

10:48.542 --> 10:49.834
after school...

10:50.792 --> 10:52.792
she saw Frank
pull into the driveway

10:52.875 --> 10:54.667
with Erin in the car.

10:54.750 --> 10:58.125
And she said that he got out
with diapers

10:58.208 --> 11:02.125
and wipes and formula
and brought it in for her.

11:02.208 --> 11:04.792
And I just...

11:04.875 --> 11:08.291
Why... would Frank do
all of that?

11:12.917 --> 11:14.166
I'm gonna go find out.

11:14.250 --> 11:18.250
Hey. Mare, slow down.
Don't go now.

11:18.333 --> 11:19.917
-Mare.
-Don't stop me, please.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.959
-Please don't stop me.
-Oh, shit. Mare.

11:23.041 --> 11:24.333
-No, no, no. Not--
-Oh!

11:24.417 --> 11:25.792
-Cheater.
-Do-over.

11:33.500 --> 11:34.834
Hey, Mare.

11:34.917 --> 11:36.834
C-- can we talk?

11:36.917 --> 11:40.542
Um. You remember,
this is Faye's son, Patrick,

11:40.625 --> 11:42.667
and his girlfriend, Rose?

11:42.750 --> 11:44.166
-Uh-huh.
-Mare?

11:44.250 --> 11:45.750
It'll--
it'll only take a minute.

11:45.834 --> 11:47.166
Well, can we do it tomorrow?

11:47.250 --> 11:48.500
We're in the middle
of the game here.

11:48.583 --> 11:50.959
I'd prefer
if we did it now.

11:51.041 --> 11:52.375
We're in the middle
of something, Mare.

11:52.458 --> 11:55.917
-Can we do this tomorrow?
-You lied to me the other night.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.500
Erin McMenamin, you said
you never really talked to her.

11:59.458 --> 12:00.500
It was a lie.

12:04.792 --> 12:06.792
Will you excuse me for a minute?

12:17.166 --> 12:19.792
So you knew her more
than you were letting on, huh?

12:19.875 --> 12:20.875
Yes.

12:20.959 --> 12:22.709
But we could have
this conversation

12:22.792 --> 12:23.875
in a different way.

12:23.959 --> 12:26.000
What different way?
I'm investigating her murder.

12:26.083 --> 12:28.500
Or not when Faye's son
is here, who just got here
from California!

12:28.583 --> 12:30.208
So excuse me for forgetting
my fucking manners!

12:30.291 --> 12:31.583
Mom! What's going on?

12:31.667 --> 12:33.917
Ask your father. He lied to me.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.917
He knew Erin McMenamin
when he told me he didn't.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.250
And there's a rumor
he's the father of her baby.

12:40.333 --> 12:41.834
What? What the fuck is--

12:44.917 --> 12:47.291
So what's the truth, huh?

12:52.667 --> 12:54.375
Yeah, I helped her out.

12:57.250 --> 12:59.125
It was after Kevin died, and...

13:02.375 --> 13:04.208
She confided in me
after class one day.

13:04.291 --> 13:07.000
She was upset.
Things weren't good at home.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.792
She needed things
for her baby and...

13:11.250 --> 13:14.542
I felt sorry for her,
so I bought her a few things.

13:16.041 --> 13:17.166
Did you have sex with her?

13:17.250 --> 13:19.083
Mom, are you fucking serious
right now?

13:19.166 --> 13:20.333
Get back in the house, Siobhan.

13:20.417 --> 13:21.792
-No, stay right there.
-No. Fuck you.

13:21.875 --> 13:23.542
-Don't talk to me like that.
-I'm not afraid-- Stay--

13:23.625 --> 13:26.500
-Please, get back in the house.
-No, you stay right there.

13:28.208 --> 13:32.083
No. I never had sex with her.

13:32.166 --> 13:34.417
And you know I never did.
You know I never would.

13:35.875 --> 13:37.333
Besides, where the hell
did you even hear

13:37.417 --> 13:39.500
-crap like that anyway?
-Lori.

13:40.333 --> 13:41.500
Someone told Lori.

13:45.792 --> 13:47.125
Wow.

13:47.208 --> 13:50.166
Are you willing...
...to take a paternity test?

13:53.000 --> 13:55.291
Sure, Mare. I'll take your test.

13:56.458 --> 13:58.000
Have your lab guys
come over to the house.

13:58.083 --> 14:01.125
-That's not how it works.
-Well, you tell me how it works.

14:01.208 --> 14:02.375
I'm not afraid of their test,

14:02.458 --> 14:04.750
just like I'm not afraid
to talk about our son!

14:27.500 --> 14:28.750
Come on. Let's go in.

14:31.208 --> 14:33.458
Hey, guys, sorry about that.

14:36.542 --> 14:39.083
She was a good mother, Erin.

14:39.166 --> 14:42.709
On our weekends with him,
she would call me and say,

14:42.792 --> 14:45.208
"I'm dying to see him."

14:45.291 --> 14:47.041
And I'd sneak him
out of the house,

14:47.125 --> 14:48.625
and she'd be
waiting in the driveway

14:48.709 --> 14:50.625
-in her dad's truck.

14:51.709 --> 14:53.792
She'd just squeeze him
for a minute.

14:55.291 --> 14:57.625
Dylan didn't like
that I let her do that, but...

14:57.709 --> 15:00.375
as a mother,
I understood, you know?

15:00.458 --> 15:03.667
I'm really sorry
about what happened to your son.

15:03.750 --> 15:05.583
What can we help
you with, detective?

15:06.500 --> 15:09.166
I need Dylan
to submit a DNA sample.

15:11.625 --> 15:13.625
He didn't kill Erin.

15:15.250 --> 15:16.250
We received information

15:16.333 --> 15:18.375
that he might not be
DJ's real father.

15:20.875 --> 15:21.917
What?

15:22.000 --> 15:24.083
No. That's impossible.
Who even told you that?

15:24.166 --> 15:25.375
-I mean--
-It might be just a rumor.

15:25.458 --> 15:28.083
They're not sure
he's ever gonna walk again.

15:28.166 --> 15:29.166
I understand,

15:29.250 --> 15:31.834
but I'm investigating a murder
right now.

15:33.542 --> 15:36.625
So, I'm sorry,
but I-- I do need to be sure.

15:37.417 --> 15:39.000
This could help his case.

15:41.417 --> 15:43.291
Okay. Okay. We'll talk to Dylan.

15:44.250 --> 15:46.166
The night
of Friday the 10th,

15:46.250 --> 15:47.375
where were you?

15:47.458 --> 15:49.834
I was celebrating my engagement.

15:49.917 --> 15:51.709
We had a small party
at my house,

15:51.792 --> 15:53.458
with, uh, friends and family.

15:53.542 --> 15:56.333
About 10:00,
we went to the Forest Lodge.

15:56.417 --> 16:00.959
I got home around...
2:30 in the morning.

16:01.041 --> 16:02.291
How'd you get home?

16:02.375 --> 16:03.458
A friend.

16:03.542 --> 16:05.667
-Which friend?
-John Ross.

16:07.208 --> 16:08.500
And who's John Ross?

16:08.583 --> 16:10.750
Mare knows him.
He's married to her best friend.

16:12.875 --> 16:14.709
Of course.

16:15.250 --> 16:16.375
Um...

16:17.291 --> 16:19.792
Will you submit to a DNA sample?

16:19.875 --> 16:23.542
Yes. But I want you to know
something, detective.

16:23.625 --> 16:26.291
I never had sex
with Erin McMenamin.

16:26.375 --> 16:28.041
And I certainly didn't kill her.

16:37.542 --> 16:39.625
-Morning.
-Morning.

16:39.709 --> 16:42.417
Erin McMenamin's cell phone
records just came in.

16:42.500 --> 16:44.125
I left them on your desk.

16:44.208 --> 16:45.458
Okay.

16:45.542 --> 16:49.750
-Frank's here... with Faye.

16:50.834 --> 16:53.709
-Okay. Thanks for the heads up.
-Hmm.

17:01.125 --> 17:02.208
Morning.

17:18.792 --> 17:21.041
All right. You're all done.

17:46.083 --> 17:49.083
So, how'd it go at the hospital
with the Hincheys?

17:49.166 --> 17:50.875
They're gonna speak to Dylan
about, uh,

17:50.959 --> 17:53.000
giving us a DNA sample
when he wakes up.

17:54.417 --> 17:57.375
Time-stamped records from
Erin McMenamin's cell phone.

17:57.458 --> 18:00.959
Last call made was at 10:55 p.m.

18:01.041 --> 18:02.709
After the fight in the woods?

18:02.792 --> 18:05.792
-Who did she call?
-Deacon Mark Burton.

18:06.709 --> 18:09.583
He's a priest
at Saint Michael's Parish.

18:19.750 --> 18:20.875
Hey.

18:20.959 --> 18:23.000
Have you finally heard
the call of God?

18:24.000 --> 18:26.583
Detective Zabel,
Father Hastings.

18:26.667 --> 18:27.834
Expert Manhattan drinker

18:27.917 --> 18:29.166
and pastor here
at Saint Michael's.

18:29.250 --> 18:31.333
Also happens to be my cousin.

18:32.750 --> 18:33.750
Nice to meet you, Father.

18:33.834 --> 18:35.125
You as well, detective.

18:35.208 --> 18:36.959
We're looking for Deacon Mark.
Is he in?

18:37.041 --> 18:39.959
Yeah. Uh. Well, he's--
he's over at the church.

18:40.041 --> 18:41.709
-I'll walk you over.
-No. That's okay.

18:41.792 --> 18:43.333
Stay. We'll go over and get him.

18:46.166 --> 18:48.041
Is there anybody
you're not related to?

18:48.125 --> 18:49.834
No.

18:49.917 --> 18:51.959
So what do we do?
Do we bring him in?

18:52.041 --> 18:54.083
Nope. We're gonna
question him right here.

18:55.542 --> 18:57.250
In the house of God?

18:57.333 --> 18:59.041
Makes it harder for him to lie.

18:59.917 --> 19:02.125
Since, uh...

19:02.208 --> 19:04.500
you were the last call
Erin McMenamin made

19:04.583 --> 19:06.166
the night she was killed,
you'd agree it's important

19:06.250 --> 19:09.041
for us to get the context
of that, uh, conversation.

19:09.125 --> 19:11.458
-Is that all right, deacon?
-Yes. Of course.

19:11.542 --> 19:13.208
-All right.

19:16.125 --> 19:18.291
Where were you
the night of January 10th?

19:18.375 --> 19:21.417
I was here at the rectory
all night with Father Peter.

19:21.500 --> 19:24.166
Can you tell us what you
and Erin discussed on your call?

19:24.250 --> 19:26.709
We spoke briefly.
A couple of minutes, I think.

19:26.792 --> 19:30.000
And she-- she was very upset.
I could tell she'd been crying.

19:30.083 --> 19:31.583
There was some betrayal,
I gathered,

19:31.667 --> 19:33.000
but I-- I didn't get
into specifics.

19:33.083 --> 19:35.583
-Why would she call you?
-Uh, pardon?

19:35.667 --> 19:37.542
Well, a 16-year-old girl
with friends, a dad.

19:37.625 --> 19:39.291
I mean, why call Deacon Mark
at Saint Michael's?

19:39.375 --> 19:41.375
Seems kinda like
an odd choice, right?

19:41.458 --> 19:44.917
I don't see it as odd. No.
I-- We had a relationship.

19:46.375 --> 19:48.083
A friendship that began
while she was

19:48.166 --> 19:49.667
in our parish youth group.

19:49.750 --> 19:52.750
I-- I make myself available
to all members of our parish,

19:52.834 --> 19:54.583
but especially our youth.

19:54.667 --> 19:56.041
I find that they need me
the most.

19:56.125 --> 19:57.667
Do other members
of the youth group call you

19:57.750 --> 20:00.792
-at eleven o'clock at night?
-No. Not usually, no.

20:00.875 --> 20:02.667
But if they did, I would answer.

20:02.750 --> 20:04.583
Were you ever alone with Erin?

20:05.959 --> 20:08.291
Yes. There were--
Over the years, there were times

20:08.375 --> 20:09.834
that we were alone.

20:09.917 --> 20:13.166
Does that, um, does
that worry you at all, deacon?

20:13.250 --> 20:15.208
I mean, you know,
being alone with a child,

20:15.291 --> 20:18.667
with all the recent reports
of priests, uh--

20:18.750 --> 20:20.417
Of course. There were, yeah.

20:20.500 --> 20:24.458
But I can't allow it to stop me
from fulfilling my vocation.

20:24.542 --> 20:26.208
That's a battle I can't avoid.
I won't.

20:26.291 --> 20:27.792
And what are you, uh...

20:28.625 --> 20:30.291
what are you battling, exactly?

20:31.792 --> 20:33.208
Human weakness.

20:33.291 --> 20:36.417
Loneliness, doubt,
hatred, irresolution.

20:36.500 --> 20:39.041
It's not my battle.
It's Christ's battle.

20:39.125 --> 20:41.875
So I-- I don't ever see it
as me offering mercy.

20:41.959 --> 20:44.875
It's Christ himself
working through me.

20:44.959 --> 20:46.125
I'm his vessel.

20:47.250 --> 20:48.542
Just so we're all clear,
was it you

20:48.625 --> 20:50.917
on the phone with Erin
or Christ himself?

20:53.000 --> 20:56.083
-That was me, detective.
-Hmm. Hmm.

20:56.166 --> 20:58.125
And did she say
where she was going?

20:59.542 --> 21:00.667
No.

21:00.750 --> 21:03.250
Seems odd
you wouldn't call and tell us

21:03.333 --> 21:07.667
that she, uh, phoned you
the same night she was murdered.

21:07.750 --> 21:09.792
Did she, uh--
How did you end the call?

21:11.375 --> 21:13.417
I told her that, uh,
she was loved,

21:13.500 --> 21:15.625
and I said, "God bless."

21:20.166 --> 21:21.750
-Thanks.
-All right.

21:21.834 --> 21:22.875
Thank you.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.417
Appreciate your time, deacon.

21:27.500 --> 21:29.458
Yes. Of course.
Anything I can do to help.

21:29.542 --> 21:31.500
Oh. Oh, uh, one last thing.

21:31.583 --> 21:34.041
Will you give us consent
to look at your cell phone?

21:34.959 --> 21:36.250
Or we can head back
to the station,

21:36.333 --> 21:37.583
get a warrant, come back for it.

21:37.667 --> 21:41.000
-It's your choice.
-There's... no need.

21:42.667 --> 21:46.000
-What's your passcode?
-It's four, eight, five, two.

21:47.875 --> 21:49.041
Have a nice day.

21:55.375 --> 21:56.750
Everything go all right?

22:06.208 --> 22:07.291
Where's Siobhan?

22:07.375 --> 22:08.959
-Huh?
-Mom?

22:09.041 --> 22:12.333
Her room's a goddamn disaster,
and it smells like pot.

22:15.291 --> 22:20.083
The band has a radio show
over at Haverford College.

22:21.458 --> 22:23.834
You look nice.
Where are you going?

22:23.917 --> 22:25.125
I have a date.

22:26.208 --> 22:27.500
No shit.

22:27.583 --> 22:29.959
All right.
Don't act so surprised.

22:30.041 --> 22:32.959
Well, I mean,
is-- is it somebody I know?

22:33.583 --> 22:35.375
No. His name is Richard.

22:35.458 --> 22:39.041
And, uh... And he--
and he's a writer.

22:39.125 --> 22:42.709
-That's wonderful, Mare.
-All right. Just don't-- Like--

22:42.792 --> 22:44.709
Like, you haven't met him yet,
you know?

22:44.792 --> 22:47.917
Like, what if the Elephant Man
walks through the door?

22:48.000 --> 22:50.542
I'm just glad he exists.

22:50.625 --> 22:53.208
And-- and that you're--
you're going out and...

22:54.208 --> 22:55.583
moving on with your life.

22:56.083 --> 22:57.375
Mm-hmm.

22:57.458 --> 22:59.208
Hey, you know
what you should do?

22:59.291 --> 23:01.875
You should parade him
right past Frank's house.

23:01.959 --> 23:03.667
You know, maybe grab his ass.

23:03.750 --> 23:04.875
-Yeah.

23:04.959 --> 23:06.750
I don't think that would be
very wise right now.

23:06.834 --> 23:08.959
-That's probably him.

23:15.417 --> 23:16.542
-Hey.
-Hi.

23:16.625 --> 23:17.500
You look great.

23:17.583 --> 23:19.000
-Oh, thanks.
-Richard.

23:19.083 --> 23:21.125
-Uh, come on in.
-Hi.

23:21.208 --> 23:23.458
Mare, aren't you gonna
introduce us?

23:23.542 --> 23:27.208
Uh. Richard, this is my mother,
Mrs. Fahey.

23:27.291 --> 23:29.083
Oh,
nice to meet you, Mrs. Fahey.

23:29.166 --> 23:30.875
I see where Mare
gets her beauty.

23:30.959 --> 23:33.500
Um, well, it was very nice
to meet you too.

23:33.583 --> 23:36.375
-And, please, call me Helen.
-Helen. Of course.

23:36.458 --> 23:37.792
Mare has told me all about you.

23:37.875 --> 23:39.250
-That's a lie.
-Really?

23:39.333 --> 23:41.834
I literally told her about you
30 seconds ago. Mom!

23:41.917 --> 23:43.291
So, where'd you two meet?

23:43.375 --> 23:45.375
-Forest Tavern.
-But I have managed

23:45.458 --> 23:47.041
to coax her out
to a restaurant this evening.

23:47.125 --> 23:51.000
Oh, I bet that didn't take
too much coaxing.

23:51.083 --> 23:52.417
-Okay. We're leaving.

23:52.500 --> 23:54.709
-Let's go. Let's go.
-Okay. All right.

23:54.792 --> 23:57.583
-Good night, Helen.
-Good night. Bye, Richard.

23:57.667 --> 24:01.417
-All right. I am Anne Harris,

24:01.500 --> 24:06.792
and you're listening
to WWXU Haverford College Radio.

24:06.875 --> 24:08.542
That was Mannequin Pussy.

24:08.625 --> 24:11.417
Next up, I saw these guys
play a few weeks back,

24:11.500 --> 24:14.208
and their set
totally blew me away.

24:14.291 --> 24:18.083
So get ready for a local band
with big promise.

24:18.166 --> 24:21.625
Androgynous,
coming up live in our studio.

24:26.250 --> 24:27.333
Becca?

24:28.041 --> 24:29.583
Becca, we go on in two minutes.

24:29.667 --> 24:31.250
Are you gonna be okay?

24:31.333 --> 24:34.542
I'm fine. I'm totally fine.

24:34.625 --> 24:36.542
I'm just resting.

24:38.291 --> 24:40.667
Thought we talked about
how this was a big opportunity

24:40.750 --> 24:42.500
and you guys
weren't gonna pre-game.

24:42.583 --> 24:44.291
Well, w-- we-- we didn't.

24:44.375 --> 24:47.375
But, yeah, Becca definitely ate
a handful of edibles

24:47.458 --> 24:48.458
before we got here.

24:48.542 --> 24:50.250
-Speaking of, I was thinking

24:50.333 --> 24:51.792
that we could take ours now,

24:51.875 --> 24:54.667
and then they would hit us
right after the set.

24:54.750 --> 24:56.458
No. No.

24:56.542 --> 24:57.667
-God.

24:57.750 --> 24:59.792
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

25:01.333 --> 25:04.500
Hey, so I just wanted to give
you, like, a little preview.

25:04.583 --> 25:06.166
So I'll do
a little introduction.

25:06.250 --> 25:07.500
-Mm-hmm.
-And then

25:07.583 --> 25:09.125
I'll turn it over to...

25:11.583 --> 25:12.875
-To me, yeah.
-Okay.

25:12.959 --> 25:14.583
-I wasn't sure, so...
-Thanks.

25:14.667 --> 25:16.208
-Okay. I just wasn't sure.
-Yeah.

25:17.750 --> 25:19.125
-Oh, my God.
-Oh.

25:19.208 --> 25:21.709
-Oh, god. Shit. Shit.

25:21.792 --> 25:24.166
Fuck me. Jesus Christ.

25:24.250 --> 25:26.000
-I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry.

25:26.083 --> 25:28.250
-I'm so sorry.
-It's okay, I think
I have an extra sweatshirt.

25:28.333 --> 25:29.500
Gabeheart, help us out, man.

25:29.583 --> 25:31.917
No. No. I'm fine.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.875
Here. Put this on her, and I'll
run and get some towels.

25:33.959 --> 25:36.375
Thank you.
Thank you so much. I'm so sorry.

25:36.458 --> 25:37.959
Sorry, Anne.

25:38.041 --> 25:40.542
-Arms up.
Arms up, Becca. Come on.
-Guys? I have to pee.

25:43.333 --> 25:45.458
He's so funny right now.
He's-- God, he's cute.

25:45.542 --> 25:49.041
He has a loose tooth.
Finally out of diapers at night.

25:49.125 --> 25:50.291
My daughter is great with him.

25:50.375 --> 25:51.834
She's in her last year
of high school.

25:51.917 --> 25:53.834
-What's her name?
-Siobhan.

25:53.917 --> 25:56.750
-So...

25:56.834 --> 25:58.709
why did you become a writer?

25:58.792 --> 26:01.750
Oh, uh... well...

26:02.667 --> 26:04.375
my home life
was shit, you know?

26:04.458 --> 26:07.208
My, um... my mom was basically

26:07.291 --> 26:10.375
a string of major depressive
episodes, you know?

26:10.458 --> 26:12.291
She was there, not there. And...

26:13.875 --> 26:16.458
and my father, uh...

26:20.542 --> 26:22.000
You close to your father?

26:23.542 --> 26:26.709
He was my-- my best friend.

26:26.792 --> 26:28.667
And he passed away
when I was 13.

26:28.750 --> 26:30.375
-Oh.

26:30.458 --> 26:31.667
He was a detective.

26:32.959 --> 26:34.000
-Really?
-Yeah.

26:34.083 --> 26:35.250
You know, if he'd been
a bartender,

26:35.333 --> 26:36.667
I would've been a bartender.

26:36.750 --> 26:39.250
If he had shoveled shit,
I probably would have

26:39.333 --> 26:41.375
-shoveled shit, you know?
-Ah.

26:41.458 --> 26:44.458
-You must miss him?
-Yeah, I do.

26:44.542 --> 26:46.458
Well, at least you still have
your mother.

26:46.542 --> 26:50.875
-Oh, we can't stand each other.
-Oh, come on. You live together.

26:50.959 --> 26:55.542
Well, when Frank moved out,
she moved in to help, uh,

26:55.625 --> 26:58.125
take care of Drew
after my, uh...

26:59.709 --> 27:01.834
uh, my-- my son died.

27:03.417 --> 27:06.500
Oh, Mare. I'm-- I'm sorry.
I didn't know that.

27:06.583 --> 27:09.041
I didn't tell you, so...

27:09.125 --> 27:10.667
Had-- had he been sick?

27:12.667 --> 27:13.709
Uh. Yeah.

27:16.500 --> 27:17.625
Yeah. And now, his--

27:17.709 --> 27:20.333
his girlfriend, Drew's mother,
wants custody.

27:21.375 --> 27:22.625
But he's always lived with us,

27:22.709 --> 27:25.208
and she's been in and out
of rehab, so...

27:26.583 --> 27:28.542
I'm trying to figure out
a way to keep him.

27:28.625 --> 27:31.208
Yeah. It's a big mess
at the moment.

27:32.875 --> 27:34.000
Yeah.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.333
My ex took my son away. And...

27:39.291 --> 27:41.125
she had every right to
at the time.

27:41.208 --> 27:44.417
You know, I-- I was not ready
to be a father.

27:44.500 --> 27:49.667
I mean, this was '96,
and-- and Luke was two.

27:49.750 --> 27:52.375
You know, I'd written the book.
Everyone loved it.

27:53.542 --> 27:56.166
Uh, women, especially, loved it.

27:56.250 --> 27:59.417
And I loved it
that they wanted to know...

27:59.500 --> 28:02.250
hear what I had to say. So...

28:03.750 --> 28:06.375
suffice to say,
I s-- spent many years

28:06.458 --> 28:09.458
waking up with women
I didn't wanna see anymore.

28:09.542 --> 28:13.083
What-- So, what happened
with your son?

28:13.166 --> 28:15.959
I mean... d'you get to see him
or what?

28:16.041 --> 28:19.375
Yeah. It's okay, you know? We--

28:19.458 --> 28:21.375
We're good.
We have a good relationship now.

28:21.458 --> 28:22.625
-Yeah.
-Mm.

28:24.375 --> 28:27.000
I know it's not
the same thing, but I...

28:27.083 --> 28:28.959
I think you ought to sit
with Drew's mother

28:29.041 --> 28:31.458
and-- and-- and tell her...

28:31.542 --> 28:33.291
that you wanna be
part of his life.

28:35.250 --> 28:37.208
And if it feels like you--
you're conceding something

28:37.291 --> 28:38.917
or whatever, you're not.

28:40.500 --> 28:42.000
Okay? He's your grandson.

28:43.500 --> 28:45.625
-You don't wanna lose him.

28:50.792 --> 28:53.000
-Sorry. I forgot my purse.
-Oh, your purse?

28:53.083 --> 28:54.583
-Yeah, I have it.

28:54.667 --> 28:55.875
Yeah.

28:59.083 --> 29:00.291
Here you go.

29:00.375 --> 29:02.542
-Thanks.
- Um...

29:02.625 --> 29:03.750
Is she okay?

29:03.834 --> 29:05.834
Yeah. Yeah. She'll be fine.

29:05.917 --> 29:09.667
She just needs to party less.
A lot less.

29:11.458 --> 29:14.750
I thought you guys
were great at Bryn Mawr.

29:14.834 --> 29:16.166
Thank you.

29:17.166 --> 29:19.208
You have
a really beautiful voice.

29:21.166 --> 29:24.500
- Oh, sorry. Um...

29:24.583 --> 29:26.875
So, do you guys have a show
this weekend?

29:26.959 --> 29:28.458
No. No. We're off.

29:30.083 --> 29:33.375
Well, I have an extra ticket
to see Boygenius

29:33.458 --> 29:35.542
at the Met on Friday night.

29:36.917 --> 29:38.083
Oh. Um...

29:39.583 --> 29:42.750
Oh, yeah. That's me asking you
out on a date, Siobhan.

29:46.792 --> 29:48.375
Uh, I can't.

29:48.458 --> 29:51.875
-I'm sorry.
-Oh. No, that's okay.

29:52.709 --> 29:55.250
-Thank you.
-Sure. Yeah.

30:07.166 --> 30:09.917
A group of kids were playing
football and came across it.

30:13.125 --> 30:16.083
-We get the K-9 out?
-He's here now.

30:16.166 --> 30:18.709
Alerted to something over
by the amphitheater already.

30:23.959 --> 30:25.667
Should we be looking
for Erin's bike?

30:26.959 --> 30:30.125
The ME said she was killed
between midnight and 2:00 a.m.

30:30.208 --> 30:32.875
We're 13.7 miles away
from Creedham Creek.

30:32.959 --> 30:35.458
There's no way she rode
her bike that far.

30:35.542 --> 30:36.959
Someone must've picked her up.

30:40.500 --> 30:44.417
Hi. Detective Sheehan.
This is, uh, Detective Zabel.

30:44.500 --> 30:45.959
So what did we find?

30:46.041 --> 30:48.375
The dog hit on scents
in two places.

30:48.458 --> 30:50.417
Over there,
where finger was found,

30:50.500 --> 30:53.000
and right here,
all along this bridge.

30:58.083 --> 30:59.750
Okay. Thank you.

30:59.834 --> 31:03.250
Boyle, I wanna yellow tape
this entire area

31:03.333 --> 31:05.667
right around the pond,
50 yards back.

31:05.750 --> 31:08.000
Nobody in or out,
except forensics.

31:08.083 --> 31:10.041
-All right? Nobody.
-You got it, Mare.

31:12.083 --> 31:14.750
Okay. I think we found
our crime scene.

31:14.834 --> 31:15.959
Mm-hmm.

31:19.750 --> 31:21.208
All right, Zabel.

31:21.291 --> 31:24.583
The killer shoots her here.
Why drag her body over there?

31:25.000 --> 31:26.125
Come on.

31:26.875 --> 31:28.750
To hide the body.

31:28.834 --> 31:31.875
He puts her there,
goes and gets his car...

31:31.959 --> 31:33.500
then comes back
and picks her up.

31:33.583 --> 31:35.041
Takes her body out
to Creedham Creek.

31:35.125 --> 31:36.959
-He?
-She.

31:37.041 --> 31:39.875
There's no bullet found
lodged in Erin's body, right?

31:39.959 --> 31:41.667
-Who knows where that went.
-Right.

31:41.750 --> 31:43.083
There's probably casings
and projectiles

31:43.166 --> 31:45.125
-right around here.
-Right.

31:45.208 --> 31:47.000
And we know there's at least
two bullets

31:47.083 --> 31:48.375
'cause she was shot twice.

31:48.458 --> 31:51.208
No, she was hit twice.
Maybe just once,

31:51.291 --> 31:53.500
if her hand was up
protecting her face.

31:53.583 --> 31:55.375
She could have been shot at
a hundred times

31:55.458 --> 31:56.667
for all we know.

31:56.750 --> 31:59.125
There could be bullet fragments
all over this fucking park.

31:59.208 --> 32:01.333
Right. Right.

32:02.375 --> 32:03.458
Uh...

32:04.375 --> 32:06.083
we could bring in
metal detectors,

32:06.166 --> 32:10.792
but depending on the angle,
it's-- it's a very large area.

32:10.875 --> 32:14.000
Yeah. That's why we're calling
out the firearm K-9s.

32:14.083 --> 32:15.917
You guys even have firearm K-9s?

32:16.000 --> 32:18.500
No. No. But county does.

32:19.875 --> 32:22.917
Top-notch dogs, too,
from what I hear.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.542
Just need someone
to make the call.

32:28.041 --> 32:31.250
Those bullets could be
half a mile in any direction.

32:31.333 --> 32:33.333
Mm-hmm.

32:33.417 --> 32:35.250
You really want me round up
all the dogs out here

32:35.333 --> 32:37.333
on a-- on a long shot like this?

32:38.583 --> 32:40.000
Unless you got a better idea...

32:41.208 --> 32:42.333
hero detective.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.792
Yeah, it's Zabel. Uh.

32:58.875 --> 33:00.875
Can you tell county radio,
I need...

33:03.083 --> 33:07.166
all six firearm dogs
out at Brandywine Park, ASAP?

33:09.792 --> 33:11.458
Dude, I don't give a shit
if they're off duty.

33:11.542 --> 33:13.125
You gotta get me these dogs.

33:13.208 --> 33:14.375
-Thanks, guys.

33:14.458 --> 33:17.250
-You just got that overtime.
-Yeah.

33:25.000 --> 33:26.375
What the fuck?

33:36.083 --> 33:38.083
Let's call it a night, huh?

33:38.166 --> 33:40.000
We've been out here
five hours now.

33:40.083 --> 33:42.583
Those dogs picked up
something around here.

33:43.291 --> 33:45.333
You heard 'em.

33:45.417 --> 33:49.250
Well, sometimes they're wrong.
Even the top-notch county dogs.

33:50.875 --> 33:51.959
It's fucking freezing out.

33:52.041 --> 33:54.375
We checked every inch
of this place, twice.

33:55.166 --> 33:57.166
-Cold?
-Yeah.

33:57.250 --> 33:59.208
You should have worn
a thicker jacket.

33:59.291 --> 34:00.583
Look at this.

34:03.917 --> 34:05.792
There. You see that nick?

34:06.750 --> 34:08.458
-Yeah.
-It's a ricochet.

34:11.709 --> 34:12.834
What?

34:18.041 --> 34:19.125
What?

34:43.875 --> 34:45.000
Zabel.

34:56.500 --> 34:58.333
Good work, hero detective.

35:02.250 --> 35:03.834
-Can you feel that?
-Mm-hmm.

35:03.917 --> 35:06.083
See if you can put some
pressure on my palm.

35:06.166 --> 35:08.125
-Wonderful.

35:09.792 --> 35:12.834
Dylan, you are
a very lucky young man.

35:12.917 --> 35:15.208
Best thing you can do right now
is rest, okay?

35:15.291 --> 35:16.583
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

35:16.667 --> 35:19.959
-Thanks, doc.

35:21.667 --> 35:24.125
I'm gonna walk around,
see if he'll go to sleep.

35:24.208 --> 35:26.959
Dr. Evans to recovery, please.

35:27.041 --> 35:29.041
-Dr. Evans to recovery.

35:29.125 --> 35:30.333
Shh.

35:32.709 --> 35:34.000
Listen.

35:34.542 --> 35:35.583
D...

35:36.291 --> 35:37.709
A, uh, detective...

35:38.709 --> 35:40.208
came by the hospital
the other day.

35:40.291 --> 35:44.083
She said there were some rumors
going around about DJ.

35:44.709 --> 35:46.542
What kind of rumors?

35:48.208 --> 35:49.250
About him...

35:50.500 --> 35:51.542
maybe...

35:52.375 --> 35:53.750
not being your son.

35:54.583 --> 35:56.625
What the fuck?

35:56.709 --> 35:58.792
-Of course he's my son.
-That's what I said.

35:58.875 --> 36:00.250
-I know--
-Like, that's
the last fucking thing

36:00.333 --> 36:02.291
-I need to hear right now.
-I get it. It's bullshit. I do.

36:02.375 --> 36:03.667
Who's going around
saying that, anyway?

36:03.750 --> 36:06.458
Hey, hey. I'm sorry
I brought it up, okay?

36:06.542 --> 36:08.709
But I think you should do
the test to be sure.

36:14.583 --> 36:18.709
Everybody,
welcome to the 37th Annual
Winter Food Drive.

36:18.792 --> 36:21.000
Meal and raffle tickets
can be ordered

36:21.083 --> 36:23.750
at the main tent
across from the west bleachers.

36:27.750 --> 36:30.041
Hey. Thank you.
Ooh, Superman pants.

36:30.125 --> 36:32.000
Reminder,
all proceeds go to supporting

36:32.083 --> 36:33.750
the Easttown Food Bank.
Thank you.

36:33.834 --> 36:36.667
Mm. Yeah, you get
the spaghetti dinner,
five dollars each.

36:36.750 --> 36:39.750
I swear that the police
ought to be looking at him.

36:40.291 --> 36:41.333
Who? Who's that?

36:41.417 --> 36:43.625
Kathy Lahey's son.

36:43.709 --> 36:46.083
They live right behind us,
and he's very strange.

36:46.166 --> 36:47.417
-Thank you.
- Thank you.

36:47.500 --> 36:49.166
I don't think
he's strange, Betty.

36:49.250 --> 36:50.834
-How many?
- Just two.

36:50.917 --> 36:53.333
Well, he's-- he's one of those
people that leaves town...

36:53.417 --> 36:55.000
-Here you go.
- Thanks so much.

36:55.083 --> 36:56.709
...and you find out
ten years later

36:56.792 --> 36:59.834
that he murdered somebody
down in Florida.

36:59.917 --> 37:01.709
Do you mind?
There's a child present.

37:01.792 --> 37:03.625
And you say, "Yep!"

37:03.709 --> 37:06.792
-Just one-- Oh, two? Okay.
- "Not surprised."

37:10.917 --> 37:12.542
Thank you. Here you go.

37:12.625 --> 37:14.083
Is he looking at me?

37:15.583 --> 37:18.166
-Yep.
-Is he still?

37:18.959 --> 37:20.250
Yep.

37:20.333 --> 37:22.625
- Two more burgers...
-Sure. Yes. Two tickets.

37:22.709 --> 37:25.667
-...and two more hotdogs.
-One water, please. Thank you.

37:25.750 --> 37:26.917
Thank you very much.

37:27.000 --> 37:28.834
-Hey, Lor, uh...

37:28.917 --> 37:30.208
...let me, uh,
have one of those.

37:30.291 --> 37:33.375
-It's warm.

37:33.458 --> 37:35.709
I need cheese. We're out.

37:35.792 --> 37:37.792
I'm not in charge
of the cheese, Mare.

37:38.667 --> 37:40.625
What's up your ass, anyway?

37:40.709 --> 37:41.750
We're two feet apart,

37:41.834 --> 37:43.458
and you haven't said
a word to me all day.

37:43.542 --> 37:46.458
Well, Frank told me you made him
submit a DNA sample.

37:48.667 --> 37:50.917
I didn't make him
do anything, all right?

37:51.000 --> 37:52.834
He willingly came
to the station.

37:54.333 --> 37:57.125
You really think Frank had
anything to do with this, Mare?

37:58.500 --> 38:01.333
-Well, if he needs an alibi...

38:03.000 --> 38:05.250
I brought him home,
2:30 in the morning,

38:05.333 --> 38:07.041
singing "Uptown Girl. "

38:07.125 --> 38:09.041
Then he took a piss
in the closet.

38:12.959 --> 38:15.250
-Okay?
-Hey, Mare!

38:23.500 --> 38:24.709
-Hey.
-Hey.

38:24.792 --> 38:26.041
A message on the tip line.

38:26.125 --> 38:28.417
Anonymous caller asking us
to look into the circumstances

38:28.500 --> 38:30.625
of Deacon Mark's transfer
to Saint Michael's.

38:30.709 --> 38:32.041
Circumstances of the transfer?

38:32.125 --> 38:33.375
What does that mean?

38:33.458 --> 38:36.000
It means he was at one parish
and got shipped off to another

38:36.083 --> 38:37.750
for a reason.

38:37.834 --> 38:39.083
Has your cousin
mentioned anything

38:39.166 --> 38:41.041
about why Deacon Mark
was transferred?

38:42.542 --> 38:43.583
No.

38:45.166 --> 38:46.583
But I haven't asked.

39:10.583 --> 39:11.750
Light's on.

39:16.083 --> 39:17.917
Where does he drink
those Manhattans?

39:19.208 --> 39:20.417
Whatever.

39:31.750 --> 39:34.333
What's that?
You want that there?

39:34.417 --> 39:36.083
Put some of those there?

39:36.750 --> 39:37.917
Yeah.

39:38.041 --> 39:40.083
Will you bring him
over here, Dad?

39:40.166 --> 39:42.792
Just put him on my lap.

39:42.875 --> 39:45.792
-The doctor said you're
not supposed to put--
-Just put him on my lap.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.583
-Come here.

39:53.417 --> 39:54.583
Go see Dada.

39:55.792 --> 39:57.333
Here we go.

40:21.667 --> 40:23.750
Oh, for fuck's sake.

40:23.834 --> 40:26.417
I want those removed right now.

40:26.500 --> 40:28.875
-Settle down, B.
-Settle down?

40:28.959 --> 40:31.709
What if it was your penis
painted out there?

40:31.792 --> 40:33.583
I don't know
what the big deal is.

40:33.667 --> 40:35.709
They don't even look like yours.

40:37.000 --> 40:38.667
I know who did it, too.

40:38.750 --> 40:41.083
That little bastard
sitting right there.

40:41.166 --> 40:43.583
No, we don't know that.
It could have been anybody.

40:43.667 --> 40:46.583
Did you get that, uh,
security camera set up,
Mr. Carroll?

40:46.667 --> 40:48.875
Yeah. Yeah.
Let me get my glasses.

40:51.458 --> 40:52.625
Oh, this is awful.

40:52.709 --> 40:54.750
Well, you shouldn't
have been spreading rumors

40:54.834 --> 40:56.875
about him, Betty.
It serves you right.

40:56.959 --> 41:00.000
This is humiliating.

41:00.083 --> 41:02.458
I don't think I can even
go outside in this neighborhood.

41:02.542 --> 41:05.208
I can't set foot in the church.
This is terrible.

41:07.166 --> 41:08.375
Got 'em, Mare.

41:11.333 --> 41:13.166
-Anything?
-Nope.

41:13.250 --> 41:15.000
Still don't seem like
it's working, Mr. Carroll.

41:15.083 --> 41:16.750
What do you mean
it's not working?

41:16.834 --> 41:19.333
Big surprise.

41:19.417 --> 41:23.500
-Can't you do anything right?
-Will you let it rest?

41:25.291 --> 41:27.041
How's it been going here?

41:28.041 --> 41:29.959
It's going.

41:30.041 --> 41:32.083
We got a new batch
of roommates in today.

41:32.166 --> 41:34.667
One of them
brought bedbugs with her.

41:34.750 --> 41:36.458
Everyone is freaking out.

41:36.542 --> 41:39.208
I washed my bedsheets
four times already.

41:43.083 --> 41:46.417
I'm assuming you're here
'cause you got the court papers.

41:48.166 --> 41:50.417
You had to know I was
gonna come for him.

41:53.750 --> 41:55.583
Yeah. I was, uh...

41:56.875 --> 41:57.834
hoping we could wait

41:57.917 --> 41:59.458
until at least
the school year was over.

41:59.542 --> 42:01.166
I've waited long enough.

42:01.250 --> 42:04.041
I've missed
enough of his life already.

42:04.125 --> 42:06.667
I, uh, signed a lease
on a new apartment.

42:06.750 --> 42:10.250
I just think a change right now
could really disrupt him.

42:10.333 --> 42:12.458
Kids are resilient, right?

42:12.542 --> 42:13.625
Do you remember anything

42:13.709 --> 42:15.750
from when you were
four years old? 'Cause I don't.

42:16.709 --> 42:17.959
Soon we'll get into a routine,

42:18.041 --> 42:19.959
then he won't remember his life
without me.

42:24.333 --> 42:25.625
Did Frank tell you
about the tics

42:25.709 --> 42:26.875
we've been noticing recently?

42:26.959 --> 42:28.959
I don't care
about any of that shit.

42:31.750 --> 42:33.291
Well, I don't wanna give him up.

42:33.917 --> 42:35.041
So if we go to court,

42:35.125 --> 42:36.959
I'm gonna tell the judge
that you're an unfit mother,

42:37.041 --> 42:39.250
and that you have
psychotic breaks,

42:39.333 --> 42:40.875
and that you couldn't raise
a fucking kid

42:40.959 --> 42:42.166
to save your life.

42:42.250 --> 42:45.375
And that you see ghosts
in the trees,

42:45.458 --> 42:48.625
and you fucking talk to people
who aren't fucking there.

42:48.709 --> 42:51.875
And I'll tell the judge
that I'm on medication now,

42:51.959 --> 42:54.917
and I haven't had an episode
in sixteen months.

42:55.000 --> 42:57.875
And he's my son,
goddammit! Mine!

42:57.959 --> 42:59.125
Not yours!

43:06.166 --> 43:08.000
Kevin fucking hated you.

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
Do you know
how much he despised you?

43:14.208 --> 43:17.375
And if he knew you were raising
our son...

43:19.417 --> 43:22.458
So, yes, I want my son back
for me, but also for Kevin.

43:23.750 --> 43:26.166
'Cause he deserves
a lot better than you.

43:41.375 --> 43:43.625
E-trace records
came back.

43:43.709 --> 43:46.333
Besides Kenny, nobody else
has any registered firearms,

43:46.417 --> 43:48.792
including Dylan
and Brianna's parents.

43:48.875 --> 43:50.291
As far as suspects go,

43:50.375 --> 43:53.709
we're looking at family member
or intimate partner.

43:53.792 --> 43:57.041
Which gives us Dylan and Kenny.

43:57.125 --> 43:59.375
We can't confirm Kenny's
whereabouts all night.

44:00.625 --> 44:02.417
Maybe he kills Erin
in a heated argument

44:02.500 --> 44:04.542
over the baby,
and shoots Dylan

44:04.625 --> 44:06.667
in a drunken rage
for causing it.

44:08.792 --> 44:11.125
Why confess to shooting Dylan
but not Erin?

44:11.208 --> 44:12.458
You'd be surprised at the things

44:12.542 --> 44:14.792
that people will
and won't confess to.

44:14.875 --> 44:16.083
Well, what about Brianna?

44:16.166 --> 44:17.750
We know she had
bad blood with Erin.

44:18.875 --> 44:21.417
Erin's body was moved
from Brandywine Park

44:21.500 --> 44:24.250
and dumped all the way out
at Creedham Creek.

44:24.333 --> 44:26.834
You think Brianna could have
done all of that on her own?

44:27.750 --> 44:29.041
Not on her own,

44:29.125 --> 44:30.625
-but if Dylan helped her--
-I mean,
Dylan could've helped her.

44:30.709 --> 44:33.417
Jinx! You owe me a Coke.

44:37.750 --> 44:39.375
Then there's the deacon.

44:39.458 --> 44:41.041
You run his cell phone?

44:41.125 --> 44:43.834
Yep. Nothing substantial.

44:43.917 --> 44:47.208
Uh, a few texts
between him and Erin.

44:47.291 --> 44:49.625
Mostly around the time
she had the baby.

44:49.709 --> 44:53.083
-Wanna take another run at him?
-No. Not yet.

44:54.041 --> 44:55.333
May only get one more chance.

44:55.417 --> 44:57.333
Once the diocese knows
we're sniffing around,

44:57.417 --> 44:58.458
he'll lawyer up.

45:03.250 --> 45:04.458
Everything all right?

45:05.417 --> 45:09.000
Just tired of staring
at this stuff,

45:09.083 --> 45:10.417
hoping for an answer.

45:16.250 --> 45:17.583
How'd you crack it?

45:18.667 --> 45:21.625
That case in Upper Darby
with the ten-year-old girl.

45:21.709 --> 45:23.792
Oh, um...

45:26.417 --> 45:27.875
No magic.

45:27.959 --> 45:31.625
Just, uh...
...worked the case.

45:31.709 --> 45:35.041
Became consumed with it.
Obsessed.

45:35.125 --> 45:37.750
I read through statements.
Read them again.

45:37.834 --> 45:41.500
Went back to interview people,
friends, family, neighbors.

45:42.458 --> 45:44.458
Everyone. And, uh...

45:45.750 --> 45:47.250
I just kept doing it.

45:47.333 --> 45:50.709
Seeing whose story changed,
whose timeline shifted.

45:50.792 --> 45:53.291
looking for inconsistencies...

45:53.375 --> 45:55.875
over and over and over
until, uh...

45:57.166 --> 45:58.208
uh...

45:59.875 --> 46:01.250
a crack.

46:01.333 --> 46:03.417
In that case, her neighbor.

46:03.500 --> 46:05.583
There was an hour
he couldn't account for.

46:05.667 --> 46:08.041
I knew he worked
construction out on Ridge Pike.

46:09.417 --> 46:11.166
There was a dump site
out that way.

46:12.166 --> 46:13.834
That's where her body was found?

46:18.792 --> 46:20.000
We brought her home.

46:22.000 --> 46:23.208
That's all that matters.

47:32.834 --> 47:34.667
A month before
he killed himself,

47:34.750 --> 47:36.709
my brother left the house
one morning.

47:38.250 --> 47:42.000
He didn't say goodbye.
He didn't kiss his son.

47:42.083 --> 47:44.500
He left a burnt waffle
in the toaster.

47:44.583 --> 47:47.125
And then two days later,
he sent me this video.

47:47.208 --> 47:50.542
He says something at the end,
but it's cut off.

47:50.625 --> 47:52.583
It was the last time
I heard his voice.

47:54.000 --> 47:56.500
He and Carrie
weren't getting along then.

47:56.583 --> 47:59.125
And I've always wondered
who was with him.

48:00.041 --> 48:01.125
Was he alone?

48:46.917 --> 48:47.959
Hi.

48:48.250 --> 48:49.291
Hey.

48:51.333 --> 48:53.458
I just wanted to get this back.

48:54.125 --> 48:55.667
Thanks.

49:00.542 --> 49:01.750
Is that, um...

49:01.834 --> 49:04.333
Is that concert ticket
still available?

49:05.709 --> 49:08.834
Yeah. Yeah,
it's still available.

49:08.917 --> 49:10.166
Come in.

49:29.709 --> 49:32.125
Well, howdy-do there, partner.

49:32.208 --> 49:34.875
-How are ya?
-Hey. What are you doing here?

49:35.583 --> 49:37.583
Uh. Drinking.

49:37.667 --> 49:41.125
It's the, uh,
post-game with the boys.

49:41.208 --> 49:42.458
We had our, uh,

49:42.542 --> 49:46.834
fifteen-year high school reunion
over tonight at McGillin's.

49:48.041 --> 49:51.709
It's, uh, Ridley High Raiders,
class of '05.

49:52.959 --> 49:54.834
What are you doing?
What about you?

49:54.917 --> 49:55.917
What's going on?

49:56.000 --> 49:58.333
I'm just trying to drink away
a bad thought.

50:00.375 --> 50:01.834
Let me help you.

50:01.917 --> 50:04.375
Uh, bar guy!

50:04.458 --> 50:07.000
Sorry,
I won't do that again. Uh...

50:07.083 --> 50:09.792
Can we get one more
for the milady,

50:09.875 --> 50:12.000
and, uh, I'll do one of those.

50:12.083 --> 50:13.208
And, um...

50:16.250 --> 50:17.917
I'll do a shot of Jameson.

50:18.750 --> 50:19.750
Thank you.

50:22.208 --> 50:23.417
So...

50:24.375 --> 50:27.625
how was it? The, uh, reunion?

50:29.917 --> 50:33.250
Uh. It was good. It was, uh...

50:36.583 --> 50:37.750
It was pretty awful.

50:38.500 --> 50:39.750
My ex was there.

50:40.500 --> 50:42.709
Almost ex-wife.

50:44.375 --> 50:46.792
She, uh...

50:48.083 --> 50:50.333
She called it off two weeks
before the wedding.

50:50.417 --> 50:53.625
But... what're you gonna do?

50:55.542 --> 50:59.375
I'm sorry, Zabel.
That's, uh... I'm sorry.

50:59.458 --> 51:01.417
It's okay. It's just like...

51:03.709 --> 51:05.458
You know?

51:05.542 --> 51:08.041
-Hey. Here's to, uh...

51:08.125 --> 51:11.000
To uh, being us.

51:18.959 --> 51:19.875
I still don't--

51:19.959 --> 51:22.125
I still don't know
what happened, you know?

51:23.667 --> 51:27.875
I woke up one morning
and she goes, "Nope.

51:27.959 --> 51:29.667
Not in love with you anymore."

51:32.959 --> 51:36.000
Okay. Just...

51:36.625 --> 51:38.667
let me put my bagel down.

51:39.917 --> 51:41.417
You know what I mean?

51:44.500 --> 51:48.041
I'm, uh...
I don't know.

51:49.500 --> 51:51.875
I'm getting to that age, right?

51:51.959 --> 51:54.458
Forgive me, but I'm--
like, I'm getting to that age

51:54.542 --> 51:57.166
where I'm starting to look
at my life and I'm going...

51:58.792 --> 52:00.875
"Well, here's what I thought
it would be...

52:02.041 --> 52:03.500
and...

52:06.333 --> 52:08.166
here's what it actually is."

52:14.875 --> 52:16.875
Am I making any fucking sense?

52:17.792 --> 52:18.834
Well...

52:19.875 --> 52:21.667
I always imagined I'd be a cop.

52:21.750 --> 52:24.583
It's the life around me
I didn't expect to fall apart

52:24.667 --> 52:26.083
so spectacularly.

52:32.709 --> 52:34.333
Sorry about your son.

52:39.709 --> 52:41.417
I bet you were a good mother.

52:43.208 --> 52:44.458
No.

52:46.917 --> 52:48.041
No, I wasn't.

52:49.125 --> 52:52.000
Zabes! Zabes, shots!

52:52.083 --> 52:54.083
Fuck yes!

52:56.333 --> 52:58.417
-Sorry.

52:59.583 --> 53:00.750
Sorry.

53:01.667 --> 53:02.834
Go on.

53:02.917 --> 53:05.041
-Go back with your friends.

53:07.875 --> 53:10.834
I don't know
if I wanna go back with them.

53:10.917 --> 53:13.083
I think I'd rather stay here
with you.

53:31.750 --> 53:33.959
Hey, I talk you
out of that bad thought?

53:34.041 --> 53:35.875
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

53:35.959 --> 53:39.583
-Yeah. Thanks.
-Oh, thank God.

53:41.125 --> 53:45.125
All right. Well... cheers.

53:45.709 --> 53:46.792
To nuts.

53:47.959 --> 53:50.333
To hazelnuts.

53:56.959 --> 53:59.542
'Scuse me. 'Scuse me.

55:18.000 --> 55:20.750
Good morning, Chief.
What's going' on?

55:20.834 --> 55:22.208
Let's talk outside.

55:23.500 --> 55:24.458
What for?

55:24.542 --> 55:26.709
Get your coat on
and come outside.

55:38.917 --> 55:40.458
-What's going on?
-Uh...

55:40.542 --> 55:42.834
Where'd you go last night?

55:42.917 --> 55:47.291
Last night? I-- I stayed home.
Got some sleep.

55:47.375 --> 55:49.834
Station got a call early
this morning from a young woman

55:49.917 --> 55:52.583
named Carrie Layden.
Ring a bell?

55:53.917 --> 55:54.750
Yeah.

55:54.834 --> 55:56.583
Said she got pulled over

55:56.667 --> 55:59.000
late last night
out in Kennett Square.

55:59.083 --> 56:02.000
Cops found two packets of heroin
in her glove compartment.

56:02.083 --> 56:04.291
-Oh, Jesus.
-She swore
the drugs weren't hers.

56:04.375 --> 56:07.500
-That you must have
planted them on her.

56:07.583 --> 56:10.625
'Cause you wanted to make sure
she never got custody of Drew.

56:10.709 --> 56:12.750
She's...
She's a drug addict.

56:12.834 --> 56:15.625
-She'll say anything, that girl.
-That's what I thought.

56:15.709 --> 56:19.041
Until she described the stamp
on the heroin packets.

56:19.125 --> 56:23.208
A stamp I remembered
from the Barnett case last year.

56:23.291 --> 56:26.583
So I took a walk
into the evidence closet

56:26.667 --> 56:30.875
and noticed
someone changed the logs.

56:30.959 --> 56:35.417
Yesterday afternoon.
From 66 packets down to 64.

56:35.500 --> 56:37.166
And-- and you think
that was me?

56:37.250 --> 56:38.792
Cut the bullshit, Mare.

56:40.083 --> 56:41.333
I know it was you.

56:43.750 --> 56:45.542
I'm gonna have a conversation
with the DA

56:45.625 --> 56:47.959
about withdrawing
Carrie's charges.

56:49.458 --> 56:53.875
Part of me... wants to make sure
you never wear a badge again.

56:53.959 --> 56:55.208
No, come on, Chief. I--

56:55.291 --> 56:58.333
I'm placing you
on administrative leave.

56:58.417 --> 57:01.458
-What? No.
-Story is you're overworked.

57:01.542 --> 57:02.959
These two cases
have taken a toll,

57:03.041 --> 57:05.458
and you're still struggling to
deal with the loss of your son.

57:05.542 --> 57:08.000
-No, that's--
-I recommended grief counseling,

57:08.083 --> 57:11.500
and you agreed it was necessary.

57:14.291 --> 57:16.959
I'm doing you
a favor here, Mare.

57:17.041 --> 57:20.000
Because I know
what you've been through, and...

57:21.000 --> 57:22.959
I know you're worth saving.

57:24.750 --> 57:25.792
Please.

57:29.375 --> 57:30.500
Gun and badge.

57:35.750 --> 57:37.458
No. No.

58:24.375 --> 58:27.583
If it crosses your mind to keep
going on the McMenamin case,

58:28.083 --> 58:29.250
don't do it, Mare.

58:30.417 --> 58:31.458
Don't do it.

1:00:42.875 --> 1:00:44.375
-Dr. Graham?

1:00:44.458 --> 1:00:47.208
I don't want you to get
discouraged if there's not...

1:00:47.542 --> 1:00:49.709
a big hallelujah moment.

1:00:50.792 --> 1:00:51.709
Understood.

1:00:52.542 --> 1:00:53.834
Let the healing begin.

1:00:54.875 --> 1:00:55.583
Deacon Mark.

1:00:55.875 --> 1:00:57.375
I just wanted to ask you
some questions

1:00:57.458 --> 1:00:59.125
about the circumstances
of your transfer.

1:00:59.208 --> 1:01:01.208
You can understand
why I'd be concerned, right?

1:01:01.667 --> 1:01:03.625
Hello? Who are you?
Why are you calling me?

1:01:03.709 --> 1:01:05.125
Do you miss your daughter, Dawn?

1:01:05.333 --> 1:01:07.417
Five thousand dollars
by tomorrow night.

1:01:09.250 --> 1:01:11.500
Jess, did Erin
tell you how she was planning

1:01:11.583 --> 1:01:13.375
on getting the money
for that ear surgery?

1:01:13.667 --> 1:01:15.917
The only person you're helping
by keeping silent

1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:17.083
is the person who killed her.

1:01:17.875 --> 1:01:19.834
I already told you everything
that happened.

1:01:20.041 --> 1:01:20.875
Everything?

1:01:22.917 --> 1:01:23.750
Oh, my god.

1:01:25.750 --> 1:01:26.709
What are you doing here?
