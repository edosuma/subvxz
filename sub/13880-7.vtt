08:02.549 --> 08:04.021
Don't you, you little rascal?

08:04.021 --> 08:05.024
Frylock:
Carl, listen to me, man.

08:05.024 --> 08:06.194
You don't have to do this!

08:06.194 --> 08:08.969
Carl: Shut up.
I ain't doin' nothin'.

08:08.969 --> 08:10.708
Look, you're a good friend.

08:10.708 --> 08:14.921
So be a pal and split town
while I screw your girlfriend.

08:14.921 --> 08:16.827
Shake:
And is this what Freda wants?

08:16.827 --> 08:18.933
Carl: No, dude.
She wants me to kill you.

08:18.933 --> 08:21.842
- Look at her.
- Do it. Do it. Do it.

08:21.842 --> 08:24.918
Shake: Maybe -- maybe if I could
just talk to her. Honey!

08:24.918 --> 08:26.557
Frylock: Shake, you just got
to let this go, man.

08:26.557 --> 08:27.827
It's for the best.

08:27.827 --> 08:29.398
Shake:
Freda, tell me this isn't true!

08:29.398 --> 08:32.575
Look at me!
I know that you want this!

08:32.575 --> 08:35.417
I won't be ignored!

08:36.520 --> 08:38.359
We're sorry.
You have reached a number

08:38.359 --> 08:39.395
that has been disconnected

08:39.395 --> 08:40.533
or is no longer in service.

08:40.533 --> 08:42.639
Shake: Hey! Freda!

08:42.639 --> 08:45.448
I know you're getting
these messages. Whatever.

08:45.448 --> 08:47.621
I just thought I'd call ya.

08:47.621 --> 08:49.661
I stopped by our pad yesterday,

08:49.661 --> 08:52.603
and I-I noticed the key
you gave me does not work

08:52.603 --> 08:55.211
any of those brand-new locks.

08:55.211 --> 08:56.983
[ Sobs ]

08:56.983 --> 08:59.458
- Please hang up.
- Shake: Was it something I did?

08:59.458 --> 09:01.730
Is it 'cause I'm too muscular?

09:01.730 --> 09:03.235
I'll work out less!

09:03.235 --> 09:04.473
Frylock: Look at this, Shake.

09:04.473 --> 09:05.609
She looks just like Freda.

09:05.609 --> 09:07.382
She acts like her, too. See?

09:07.382 --> 09:09.153
You look very handsome.

09:09.153 --> 09:10.692
Let's go explode some ducks.

09:10.692 --> 09:13.165
Ducks. Ducks. D-d-d-d-d--ducks.

09:13.165 --> 09:14.637
Frylock: And look --
she's even got a gallon

09:14.637 --> 09:16.041
of vinegar and some antacids!

09:16.041 --> 09:18.482
Shake: I can barely tape
an m-80 to a duck

09:18.482 --> 09:20.655
without my Freda.

09:20.655 --> 09:22.093
I'm gonna win her back!

09:22.093 --> 09:23.999
Frylock: Please don't, Shake.
It's pathetic, man.

09:23.999 --> 09:26.607
Shake: What?!
I'm just gonna strut my stuff

09:26.607 --> 09:27.744
in front of her apartment

09:27.744 --> 09:29.315
and let her know
what she's missing.

09:29.315 --> 09:32.424
If you don't come out here now,
I'm gonna kill myself!

09:32.424 --> 09:33.728
Not like last Tuesday!

09:33.728 --> 09:35.501
This time, I mean it!

09:35.501 --> 09:37.239
Okay, these are mints
just like Tuesday,

09:37.239 --> 09:40.383
but if they were pills,
I would threaten to eat them!

09:40.383 --> 09:41.787
- Yeah!
- Carl: Yeah!

09:41.787 --> 09:43.191
- Shake: Freda?
- Yeah!

09:43.191 --> 09:45.298
- Shake: Carl?
- Meatwad: I'm-a be a daddy!

09:45.298 --> 09:46.735
Shake: Meatwad?!

09:46.735 --> 09:48.608
Meatwad: It was purely sexual.

09:48.608 --> 09:50.179
She didn't mean nothing to me.

09:50.179 --> 09:52.386
Carl: Us. She didn't mean
nothing to both of us.

09:52.386 --> 09:53.690
Meatwad: Us, yeah. Both us.

09:53.690 --> 09:55.228
Carl:
At the same friggin' time, dude.

09:55.228 --> 09:57.335
- Oh, man!
- Meatwad: Double bounce.

09:57.335 --> 09:58.571
Shake: Did she mention me?

09:58.571 --> 10:01.748
Oh, Carl. Oh, Meatwad.

10:01.748 --> 10:03.620
Carl:
No, pretty much just our names.

10:03.620 --> 10:05.159
So hot.

10:07.331 --> 10:08.502
Shake: What a coincidence!

10:08.502 --> 10:09.839
This is weird, right?

10:09.839 --> 10:12.180
What are you doing here?
Are you following me?

10:12.180 --> 10:14.922
Shake: What? Don't I get
a hug for old times' sake?

10:14.922 --> 10:17.128
I-I don't think
this is a good idea.

10:17.128 --> 10:18.533
Shake: Hey, what do you got
going on for lunch?

10:18.533 --> 10:21.542
You know, there is a great
noodle place over here,

10:21.542 --> 10:24.584
and it is not the one that
gave me the violent diarrhea.

10:24.584 --> 10:26.624
I got to go.

10:26.624 --> 10:27.794
[ Train whistle blows ]

10:27.794 --> 10:30.168
[ Horn blares ]

10:30.168 --> 10:31.439
Shake: Freda!

10:31.439 --> 10:33.812
Stop goofing off! I'm serious!

10:34.649 --> 10:35.785
Just climb on up here

10:35.785 --> 10:36.989
and listen to this mix tape!

10:36.989 --> 10:40.332
It will tell you
everything I feel!

10:41.369 --> 10:42.673
Fine.
You want to do it that way?

10:42.673 --> 10:44.078
I've moved on, too!

10:44.078 --> 10:46.919
Good luck with your new life!

10:46.919 --> 10:48.926
I'm doing great!

10:52.971 --> 10:54.710
Let's go explode
some d-d-d-ducks.

10:54.710 --> 10:57.419
Shake: Yes, that's what
we're doing, Doris. Thank you.

10:57.419 --> 11:00.260
- Let's go explode
some d-d-d-ducks.
- Shake: Yes.

11:00.260 --> 11:01.932
Let's go explode
some d-d-d-ducks.

11:01.932 --> 11:03.337
Shake: You realize
this is illegal, right?

11:03.337 --> 11:05.376
Let's go explode some
d-d-d-ducks.

11:05.376 --> 11:07.081
Shake: Look, I know
that the therapist said

11:07.081 --> 11:09.857
we needed
to do stuff together

11:09.857 --> 11:13.735
but you are starting
to suck the joy

11:13.735 --> 11:15.808
out of everything that I love.

11:15.808 --> 11:17.079
Let's go explode
some d-d-d-ducks.

11:17.079 --> 11:18.684
Shake: You know what?
You explode your duck,

11:18.684 --> 11:19.853
and I'll explode mine, okay?

11:19.853 --> 11:22.662
Let's go explode
some d-d-d-ducks.

11:22.662 --> 11:24.000
