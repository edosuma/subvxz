00:03.000 --> 00:05.878
<i>One of the reasons Turk and I
<i>are so popular around here</i></i>

00:05.960 --> 00:07.996
<i>is we love helping</i>
<i>our fellow doctors.</i>

00:08.080 --> 00:11.390
- Hey, Hooch.
- That's my name. Don't wear it out.

00:11.480 --> 00:14.358
Classic Hooch. Even though
I'm not gonna be paid,

00:14.440 --> 00:17.876
I'll cover your shift
so you can do Mr Schindler's endoscopy.

00:17.960 --> 00:20.235
I'll cross-cover Dr Turner's patients

00:20.320 --> 00:22.550
so Turner can assist you
on the procedure.

00:22.640 --> 00:24.835
Why are you going
through so much trouble?

00:24.920 --> 00:27.309
Who's doing the endoscopy
on Mr Schindler?

00:27.400 --> 00:29.436
- Turner and Hooch!
- Turner and Hooch!

00:30.720 --> 00:32.631
All right!

00:32.720 --> 00:34.517
Were you just Hooch?

00:34.600 --> 00:36.238
Everyone hates you guys.

00:36.320 --> 00:39.073
- Hooch.
- Hooch is crazy!

00:39.160 --> 00:42.357
<i>As much as Hooch loved us, it was</i>
<i>even better to see Turk happy.</i>

00:42.440 --> 00:46.399
<i>He and Carla started couples therapy,</i>
<i>and I'm not sure he was enjoying it.</i>

00:47.800 --> 00:49.950
Carla says you cry after you orgasm.

00:50.040 --> 00:53.032
- Would you like to talk about that?
- No, not really.

00:54.240 --> 00:56.708
<i>I decided to help their marriage</i>
<i>by moving out,</i>

00:56.800 --> 01:00.429
<i>partly because Carla and I accidentally</i>
<i>kissed and messed things up,</i>

01:00.520 --> 01:04.069
<i>but mostly because it was time.</i>
<i>Finding an apartment has not been easy.</i>

01:04.160 --> 01:05.798
I'm so sorry about your father.

01:05.880 --> 01:08.030
I'm sure he lived a wonderful life

01:08.120 --> 01:11.112
at 14 Maple Drive, apartment 4B.

01:11.200 --> 01:14.272
Was he lucky enough to enjoy
a washer and dryer in his unit

01:14.360 --> 01:16.555
while he was alive?

01:17.560 --> 01:19.357
Ever mention any hot neighbours?

01:21.520 --> 01:23.476
What are you doing
in the on-call room?

01:23.560 --> 01:24.549
Nothing.

01:24.640 --> 01:26.358
- I gotta go.
- OK.

01:27.040 --> 01:29.474
<i>Thankfully, Turk got over the kissing.</i>

01:29.560 --> 01:32.393
<i>There's a weird new thing he does</i>
<i>when he says goodbye.</i>

01:32.480 --> 01:33.959
OK, I'll see you around.

01:35.360 --> 01:36.759
Peace, homey.

01:37.880 --> 01:40.952
Do you guys think that Clarissa
is more attractive than me?

01:41.040 --> 01:42.029
Yes.

01:43.080 --> 01:44.638
Who's Clarissa?

01:44.720 --> 01:47.029
The short, balding woman
in the pharmacy.

01:47.120 --> 01:48.712
Oh, then, definitely yes.

01:48.800 --> 01:51.633
She just got engaged,
bad combover and all.

01:51.720 --> 01:54.632
She beats you to the altar,
time to hang up the ovaries.

01:54.720 --> 01:57.996
Too mean. How am I supposed
to meet a guy working in this place?

01:58.080 --> 01:59.638
Are the guys here that bad?

02:01.520 --> 02:03.875
Twelve minutes door to door!

02:03.960 --> 02:06.110
That's a personal best, suckos!

02:08.440 --> 02:10.431
Nurse, suction.

02:10.520 --> 02:12.875
The patient's not even here yet.

02:13.000 --> 02:13.989
I know.

02:15.240 --> 02:18.755
I just wish once a cute, thoughtful guy
would walk through the door.

02:21.520 --> 02:23.511
Can I get help?
My neighbour fainted.

02:23.600 --> 02:26.558
She doesn't like ambulances,
so I brought her in myself.

02:26.640 --> 02:28.870
Let me take this one.
You've got a phone call.

02:28.960 --> 02:31.633
- I'll call them back.
- Your mom died.

02:31.720 --> 02:33.119
What?

02:33.880 --> 02:36.678
Her mom's fine. It's just
a little running joke we have.

02:36.760 --> 02:39.228
She'll be laughing later.
Gotcha, Jenny!

02:40.560 --> 02:42.551
Dead mom joke's always funny.

02:44.000 --> 02:50.074

02:57.200 --> 02:59.031
So, Betty, you're back with us.

02:59.120 --> 03:00.758
And you brought a handsome buck.

03:00.840 --> 03:03.673
Are you trying to make me jealous?
You know you're my gal.

03:03.760 --> 03:04.988
Who are you?

03:05.080 --> 03:07.640
I'm Dr Dorian. I'm the one
that's taken care of you

03:07.720 --> 03:09.597
the last 19 times you've been in here.

03:09.680 --> 03:12.194
She's getting a little forgetful.

03:12.280 --> 03:14.430
- Are you a relative?
- No. Neighbour.

03:14.520 --> 03:15.748
Well, I met her once.

03:15.840 --> 03:19.628
It was raining, and you were
wearing a blue sweater.

03:19.720 --> 03:22.951
That's a lovely memory.
You know what else is a lovely memory?

03:23.040 --> 03:27.238
That Sunday I spent eight hours helping
you join the Wilford Brimley fan club.

03:27.320 --> 03:28.799
You don't remember that?

03:28.880 --> 03:30.996
I'm kind of on my way to the airport.

03:31.080 --> 03:33.640
I'm going kayaking
with friends in New Zealand.

03:33.720 --> 03:36.109
Cool. So, what are you
gonna do there?

03:36.200 --> 03:37.428
Mostly kayaking.

03:39.360 --> 03:42.113
So, Betty, I'll check on you
the second I get back, OK?

03:42.200 --> 03:43.792
You get better now.

03:43.880 --> 03:47.031
So, Elliot, the first thing
we're gonna need to do is...

03:47.120 --> 03:49.350
Is Dr Reid coming back?

03:49.440 --> 03:52.273
Don't worry. You're in
good hands with Dr Dorian.

03:52.360 --> 03:55.875
- Who's that?
- That's me, Betty. Dr Dorian.

03:55.960 --> 03:59.191
<i>Cocoon.</i> Wilford Brimley.
Steve Guttenberg, the whole day. No?

04:00.640 --> 04:05.350
Jake. So you're probably rushing home
to wipe the old person smell off?

04:05.440 --> 04:06.509
Excuse me?

04:06.600 --> 04:08.795
I'm just kidding. I love old people.

04:08.880 --> 04:11.474
There's no denying
they have a distinctive smell.

04:11.560 --> 04:15.314
I mean, it's nothing bad.
It's like a... general mustiness.

04:17.200 --> 04:19.793
Like, you know, when you get
your cast taken off,

04:19.880 --> 04:22.029
and... skin mould.

04:24.360 --> 04:25.918
Well, I got a flight to catch.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.992
- You guys need me to sign anything?
- No. You're good.

04:29.080 --> 04:30.877
OK, then.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.592
Hats off there, Barbie.

04:35.680 --> 04:39.719
The was one potent combination of
verbal diarrhoea and stunned silence.

04:39.800 --> 04:42.030
You should have asked him out.
Men love that.

04:42.120 --> 04:44.111
No, Carla, men don't love that.

04:44.200 --> 04:46.760
We don't love picnics,
foreplay, candles,

04:46.840 --> 04:49.673
baths, photo albums, or when
you drive so we can relax.

04:49.760 --> 04:52.399
And, as always, we're not that big
on Hugh Jackman.

04:52.480 --> 04:57.031
The only thing men care about as far
as dating is concerned is the chase.

04:57.120 --> 04:59.156
If you want that guy
to look your way,

04:59.240 --> 05:02.437
listen to me carefully,
ignore the living hell out of him.

05:02.960 --> 05:05.110
That's the worst advice
I've ever heard.

05:05.200 --> 05:06.189
Good point.

05:06.280 --> 05:09.909
You don't happen to have any other gems
before you run to couples therapy

05:10.000 --> 05:13.436
to sift through the wreckage that is
the first year of your marriage?

05:13.520 --> 05:17.593
Look, Dr Cox, I'm sure that you are
fantastic at picking up men. Really.

05:18.760 --> 05:21.149
But I can handle this one
on my own, thank you.

05:23.400 --> 05:26.472
Some people just cannot take a good
"your mom is dead" joke.

05:28.200 --> 05:32.159
Anyway, I worry that sometimes
when I'm tense,

05:32.240 --> 05:34.390
I can be a little condescending.

05:34.480 --> 05:36.198
Actually, I've noticed that.

05:36.280 --> 05:38.669
Have you really noticed it,
"Mr Therapist"?

05:38.760 --> 05:43.550
- Chris, what's going on with you?
- Nothing worth talking about.

05:43.640 --> 05:47.269
This is your third visit and you've
yet to say how you're feeling.

05:47.360 --> 05:50.557
I don't think there's anything wrong
with our relationship.

05:50.640 --> 05:53.552
You pretend everything's OK,
even though deep inside,

05:53.640 --> 05:55.232
a lot of things bother you.

05:55.320 --> 05:58.756
So come on, tell me what
you're thinking right now.

05:58.840 --> 06:00.910
I'm staring at that picture.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.878
Is that one of those
psychological ink blot tests

06:03.960 --> 06:07.270
where I try and figure out what it is?
Because, if so...

06:07.360 --> 06:09.316
...l'm seeing a duck.

06:10.920 --> 06:12.990
- Let's take a break.
- OK.

06:14.560 --> 06:17.358
But, Hooch, if the patient
just has simple cellulitis,

06:17.440 --> 06:19.351
why aren't the antibiotics working?

06:19.440 --> 06:22.750
Damn it, Turner,
it just doesn't make sense!

06:22.840 --> 06:24.273
<i>Even though I had created</i>

06:24.360 --> 06:26.999
<i>a super medical</i>
<i>crime-fighting team, I felt lousy.</i>

06:27.080 --> 06:29.355
<i>I told Betty her lungs</i>
<i>had given out,</i>

06:29.440 --> 06:31.749
<i>and she wasn't gonna</i>
<i>leave the hospital.</i>

06:31.840 --> 06:33.239
So...

06:34.520 --> 06:36.670
...what are my choices?

06:36.760 --> 06:39.274
Well, we could put you
on a breathing machine,

06:39.360 --> 06:41.794
but it's unlikely
you'd ever come off of it.

06:41.880 --> 06:45.031
Or I could just make sure
you're as comfortable as possible.

06:45.120 --> 06:46.997
<i>"As comfortable as possible."</i>

06:47.080 --> 06:49.913
<i>I've said that a million times,</i>
<i>but no idea what it means.</i>

06:50.000 --> 06:51.353
There you go, Betty.

06:51.440 --> 06:54.238
That's every cotton ball
in the hospital.

06:54.320 --> 06:58.916
I am very, very comfortable!

07:00.840 --> 07:02.353
Then you're ready to die.

07:03.440 --> 07:06.557
Look, is there anyone you'd
like to talk this over with?

07:09.760 --> 07:12.513
She just wants to talk to you
for a minute.

07:12.600 --> 07:13.635
Yeah? About what?

07:13.720 --> 07:16.188
Just about how and when
she should die.

07:16.280 --> 07:19.556
I counsel most of my random
neighbours on their deathbeds.

07:19.640 --> 07:21.596
This woman is alone,
she's depressed,

07:21.680 --> 07:24.672
and for some reason
feels like she's connected with you.

07:24.760 --> 07:27.991
- Sorry. I wouldn't know what to say.
- Open with a joke.

07:28.080 --> 07:31.516
Then you and your raft will be
on a four-hour trip to New Zealand.

07:31.600 --> 07:33.397
No, it's more like 14 hours.

07:33.480 --> 07:36.870
<i>You're close to revealing geography</i>
<i>is your Achilles heel.</i>

07:36.960 --> 07:39.190
<i>Say something smart</i>
<i>to regain credibility.</i>

07:39.280 --> 07:42.670
Vesa-vegal syncopy is mediated
by the autonomic nervous system.

07:42.760 --> 07:45.513
And Betty needs you, pal.
Come on. Do it.

07:45.600 --> 07:47.158
You'll feel good. Trust me.

07:47.240 --> 07:49.435
You don't even know
where New Zealand is.

07:50.200 --> 07:52.760
You can dance your way there
from Old Zealand.

07:52.840 --> 07:54.751
Are you an idiot?

07:56.280 --> 07:58.999
Elliot, my neighbour fainted too.

07:59.080 --> 08:00.354
You want to go clubbing?

08:00.440 --> 08:03.750
I don't mean dancing, I mean
going up to the roof and killing rats.

08:03.840 --> 08:07.196
- I thought we were done with this.
- Thought I'd give it a shot.

08:08.360 --> 08:10.351
Just put her back in her room.

08:10.440 --> 08:12.795
She's not a patient.
I got her at the mall.

08:13.560 --> 08:15.437
Better get you back
to the food court.

08:15.520 --> 08:17.556
Your husband's probably
come to by now.

08:19.040 --> 08:20.439
<i>Oh, my God, here he comes.</i>

08:20.520 --> 08:22.829
<i>OK, this is easy.</i>
<i>Just compliment him.</i>

08:22.920 --> 08:24.638
<i>Tell him he has a square head.</i>

08:24.720 --> 08:27.439
<i>That's not a compliment.</i>
<i>What shape is a compliment?</i>

08:27.520 --> 08:29.636
<i>Triangle? Pyramid?</i>
<i>Circle. Circle head.</i>

08:29.720 --> 08:32.871
<i>You're stuck on shapes,</i>
<i>and square head's almost here!</i>

08:32.960 --> 08:34.996
<i>Just do what Dr Cox said</i>
<i>and ignore him.</i>

08:35.080 --> 08:36.195
Hey, Elliot.

08:38.440 --> 08:41.955
That girl's kind cute.
What's her story?

08:42.039 --> 08:44.429
- She's a dude.
- Yeah?

08:44.520 --> 08:47.353
Gotta look at the Adam's apple, buddy.

08:47.440 --> 08:50.159
- Therapy is killing me.
- I don't know how you do it.

08:50.240 --> 08:53.312
Make love with your lady in front
of some old dude filming you?

08:53.400 --> 08:56.437
- That's not couples therapy, Todd.
- Then what did I do?

08:56.520 --> 08:58.988
- You did amateur porn.
- Sweet.

09:01.080 --> 09:02.229
J.D., you got a sec?

09:02.320 --> 09:04.470
- Sure. I'll be with you in a minute.
- OK.

09:04.560 --> 09:05.549
So check this out.

09:05.640 --> 09:08.871
Our therapist says I'm the type
who pretends everything's OK,

09:08.960 --> 09:11.349
even when I'm upset
deep down inside.

09:11.440 --> 09:13.431
If you look at the whole kissing thing,

09:13.520 --> 09:16.990
intellectually you moved on,
but emotionally you're still upset.

09:17.080 --> 09:19.310
- You'll get there.
- I'm not upset.

09:19.400 --> 09:22.472
Really? Oh, OK.
I'll see you later. Bye.

09:22.560 --> 09:24.835
- You see?
- See what?

09:24.920 --> 09:27.639
Let's try it again.
I'll see you later, buddy. Bye.

09:27.720 --> 09:29.790
- Bye.
- Always the same spot!

09:29.880 --> 09:32.030
It's like your fingers are stone.

09:32.120 --> 09:34.190
Last time. I'll see you later, b...

09:34.280 --> 09:35.508
Hey! Look at yourself.

09:38.040 --> 09:39.234
I've been hitting you?

09:39.320 --> 09:41.038
Yeah. You're like The Brown Hulk.

09:42.440 --> 09:44.954
Hey, how's it going in here, you two?

09:45.040 --> 09:48.112
Well, pretty good. Pretty good.
We talked about her past.

09:48.200 --> 09:51.510
Betty even let me in on a few romantic
trysts from her younger days.

09:51.600 --> 09:53.670
Are you familiar with
Mr David Brinkley?

09:53.760 --> 09:54.749
- No way.
- Yeah.

09:54.840 --> 09:56.432
Betty.

09:56.520 --> 09:59.353
Then when we finally got down
to talking for real,

09:59.440 --> 10:03.752
well, it became pretty obvious that
Betty had already made a decision.

10:04.640 --> 10:06.039
OK.

10:06.120 --> 10:07.917
<i>What impressed me</i>
<i>most about Jake,</i>

10:08.000 --> 10:10.230
<i>besides his perfectly square head,</i>

10:10.320 --> 10:13.118
<i>was that he faced this whole</i>
<i>Betty thing straight on.</i>

10:13.200 --> 10:15.873
He thinks I'm cute.
He thinks I'm cute.

10:15.960 --> 10:19.236
<i>He didn't hide because he was afraid</i>
<i>to admit someone was right.</i>

10:19.320 --> 10:21.231
- I'm cute...
- Barbie.

10:21.320 --> 10:23.959
- Why so happy?
- No reason.

10:26.320 --> 10:29.517
<i>He didn't run because he was</i>
<i>scared of facing his own feelings.</i>

10:29.600 --> 10:32.319
Baby, I'm not gonna be able
to make therapy tonight.

10:32.400 --> 10:34.914
- I got surgery.
- Fine.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.276
<i>He wouldn't be able to do it</i>
<i>if it weren't for his secret weapon...</i>

10:38.360 --> 10:39.429
Dr John Dorian.

10:39.520 --> 10:40.714
- What?
- What?

10:40.800 --> 10:43.268
You said your name in a weird
summing up way.

10:43.360 --> 10:46.716
- No, I didn't, Jake.
- Oh, so you're Jake.

10:46.800 --> 10:51.032
As I understand it, you just talked
my sister into ending her life.

10:51.120 --> 10:52.599
Long story short.

10:52.680 --> 10:54.238
I'm a lawyer. I'm suing you.

10:54.320 --> 10:58.598
Once again. Sister dying,
brother lawyer, suing you!

11:00.000 --> 11:03.959
See, that's summing up in a weird way.
Yeah.

11:04.040 --> 11:06.031
"Brother lawyer..." That's it.

11:10.280 --> 11:12.111
I can't believe this is happening.

11:12.200 --> 11:14.270
Everything's gonna be fine.
Trust me.

11:14.360 --> 11:15.952
- Is that him?
- Yes. Here's Ted,

11:16.040 --> 11:18.873
our brilliant hospital attorney.
Sharp as a tack.

11:18.960 --> 11:22.509
Mark my words, Jake, we're gonna
take every last cent you have!

11:22.600 --> 11:24.192
No, no, Ted. We're on his side.

11:24.280 --> 11:26.635
Oh. Here's my card.

11:27.200 --> 11:28.838
This is a Post-lt.

11:28.920 --> 11:31.559
I don't get real cards
until I win a case.

11:32.640 --> 11:33.709
Go take a nap, Ted.

11:34.720 --> 11:36.278
He spelled "attorney" wrong.

11:36.360 --> 11:39.750
"Buy groceries, kill self."

11:39.840 --> 11:42.070
You're sent from the future
to destroy me.

11:42.160 --> 11:44.116
I am not from the future, Jake.

11:44.200 --> 11:45.269
Gesundheit, Carol.

11:45.360 --> 11:47.749
Yes! It finally worked!
What are the odds?

11:47.840 --> 11:51.469
I don't know, J.D. What I do know
is I'm about to go down to my truck,

11:51.560 --> 11:54.120
get my kayak paddle,
and go Greg Barton on your ass.

11:54.200 --> 11:56.077
- Who's Barton?
- Famous kayaker.

11:56.160 --> 11:57.752
Oh, Greg Barton.

11:57.840 --> 11:59.637
I hate you, J.D.

11:59.720 --> 12:01.119
I know.

12:04.320 --> 12:06.470
This is the most painful thing
I've done,

12:06.560 --> 12:08.835
and I was a cutter for a week
in high school.

12:08.920 --> 12:12.629
My shop teacher thought scars were
sexy, but that's a whole other story.

12:12.720 --> 12:16.269
Your advice really worked
and I'd appreciate some more help.

12:16.360 --> 12:17.713
No problem, Barbie.

12:17.800 --> 12:20.268
Let me just finish
writing this prescription,

12:20.360 --> 12:21.918
and you'll be squared away.

12:22.880 --> 12:24.871
This is a prescription for "no."

12:24.960 --> 12:28.475
To be taken with food every Saturday
night while you're eating alone.

12:28.560 --> 12:30.869
You don't understand
the severity of this.

12:30.960 --> 12:33.679
I am dangerously close
to giving up men altogether.

12:33.760 --> 12:37.469
On behalf of men everywhere,
including the ones in the mud huts,

12:37.560 --> 12:40.120
let me be the first to say
thanks and hallelujah.

12:40.200 --> 12:43.272
See the problem with trying
to appeal to its human side?

12:43.360 --> 12:47.114
- He doesn't have one.
- Exactly. But what does he have?

12:47.200 --> 12:50.158
A shaved chest, tiny t-shirts,
and the eyes of a madman.

12:50.240 --> 12:54.791
I'm sorry. The correct answer
she was looking for is a giant ego.

12:54.880 --> 12:57.075
I have a giant ego.

12:57.160 --> 12:58.229
Damn it! I knew that.

12:58.320 --> 13:01.198
Would you just appeal to it
so I can get something to eat?

13:01.280 --> 13:04.670
- You're amazing.
- And I'm in.

13:11.240 --> 13:13.071
Dr Kelso, you can't do that.

13:13.160 --> 13:16.357
I didn't.
Your friend Turkleton did.

13:16.440 --> 13:18.829
But I can do whatever I want.

13:20.760 --> 13:22.239
You look ridiculous.

13:24.760 --> 13:27.149
I thought we were doing
moustaches on Sunday.

13:27.240 --> 13:28.878
I didn't do this. Kelso did!

13:28.960 --> 13:32.509
- You invited Kelso to Moustache Sunday?
- Enough with the moustaches.

13:32.600 --> 13:34.397
Did you break up Turner and Hooch?

13:34.480 --> 13:37.278
I needed an excuse to get out
of couples counselling.

13:37.360 --> 13:39.396
I can't open up, man.
I just can't do it.

13:39.480 --> 13:41.277
Besides, this way no one gets hurt.

13:47.400 --> 13:49.789
We had a hell of a run, man.

13:49.880 --> 13:51.233
Just get out of here.

13:57.560 --> 13:59.391
Maybe I should just go talk to him.

13:59.480 --> 14:01.550
Forget Dennis.
He's a horrible person.

14:01.640 --> 14:04.359
We'll never change his mind.
We need to focus on Betty.

14:04.440 --> 14:08.115
We'll just have her explain
how she feels. Problem solved.

14:08.200 --> 14:10.714
"Betty's in a coma."
I'm gonna talk to Dennis.

14:10.800 --> 14:12.518
He seems like a reasonable guy.

14:14.520 --> 14:17.114
Hey, Jake. How's it goin'?

14:17.200 --> 14:19.475
I've had better days.
How are you?

14:21.040 --> 14:23.713
Listen to me, Barbacious,
you gotta stay the course.

14:23.800 --> 14:24.994
Keep ignoring him.

14:25.080 --> 14:27.958
But I'm already ignoring him.
How do I ignore him more?

14:28.040 --> 14:31.350
Piece of cake. First you engage him,
then you ignore him.

14:31.760 --> 14:34.513
Elliot? I said how are you?

14:34.600 --> 14:37.398
I don't have time for this, OK?
I'm a doctor.

14:37.480 --> 14:38.799
But you asked me how I was.

14:38.880 --> 14:41.440
Trying to save lives.
It's not always about you.

14:43.040 --> 14:45.634
You would not believe
the day I'm having.

14:45.720 --> 14:48.712
Quiet, jackass. What did you say
to Elliot to make her run?

14:48.800 --> 14:51.030
- If you hurt her...
- I didn't say anything.

14:51.120 --> 14:53.031
- Everyone here is crazy.
- Not true.

14:53.120 --> 14:56.157
Let me put down my bag of rats
and explain something to you.

14:56.800 --> 15:00.190
- A bag of rats. Are those alive?
- I put a dead one in the middle.

15:00.280 --> 15:03.431
All the live ones get a good look,
they start toeing that line.

15:03.520 --> 15:06.512
- Know what I'm saying?
- I very much don't.

15:07.160 --> 15:09.151
It's pretty simple.

15:09.240 --> 15:10.878
Take a canvas bag...

15:13.280 --> 15:14.872
Jailbreak!

15:16.880 --> 15:19.394
You'll do whatever you want
with your sister,

15:19.480 --> 15:20.959
but Jake's trying to help.

15:21.040 --> 15:24.112
He's a stand-up guy, and I think
you should leave him alone.

15:24.200 --> 15:26.236
If you do I think it will be
dy-no-mite.

15:26.320 --> 15:29.630
Sorry, I was just watching
<i>Good Times</i> in the doctors' lounge.

15:29.720 --> 15:32.518
Yeah. I'm gonna
screw him to the wall.

15:34.360 --> 15:35.873
Can you believe this guy?

15:35.960 --> 15:37.951
Son, look around.

15:38.040 --> 15:41.476
There's an old man with Alzheimer's
who no one bothers to come visit.

15:41.560 --> 15:44.677
I had a chat with a woman
who refuses to stop using cocaine.

15:44.760 --> 15:46.239
She's six months pregnant.

15:46.320 --> 15:48.914
Last week I saw an older woman
fall and break her hip

15:49.000 --> 15:51.560
because some guy was
too busy to hold the door open.

15:51.640 --> 15:53.676
So you laughed and pointed.

15:53.760 --> 15:56.672
I didn't say it wasn't funny.
I just said it happened.

15:56.760 --> 16:00.594
When's the last time you saw
a glimpse of humanity in this place?

16:00.680 --> 16:02.830
<i>Kelso had a point.</i>
<i>In the outside world,</i>

16:02.920 --> 16:06.276
<i>you'll see a stream of cars drive by</i>
<i>an old woman with a flat tyre.</i>

16:06.360 --> 16:08.749
<i>Around here, every time</i>
<i>you round a corner,</i>

16:08.840 --> 16:11.638
- <i>well...</i>
- She fell again.

16:11.720 --> 16:13.995
<i>Anyway, I knew what I had to do.</i>

16:14.080 --> 16:16.389
Just go. No one here
knows your last name.

16:16.480 --> 16:18.198
They'll never be able to find you.

16:18.280 --> 16:20.794
Go enjoy your rafting thing
in New Zealand.

16:20.880 --> 16:23.952
Which, incidentally, is
10,000 miles east of Australia

16:24.040 --> 16:26.429
and famous for alcoholism
and clam chowder.

16:27.440 --> 16:28.839
Brushing up on New Zealand.

16:28.920 --> 16:31.275
You've been brushing up
on New England.

16:31.360 --> 16:34.716
Well, go anyway.
Wherever it is you're rafting.

16:36.800 --> 16:38.870
- Where's he going?
- He just left.

16:40.440 --> 16:42.192
Barbie! Go get him!

16:42.280 --> 16:44.589
I... believe in you.

16:44.680 --> 16:47.877
No, you don't. You want me to
embarrass myself to laugh at me.

16:47.960 --> 16:51.270
Like when you told me the hospital
fund raiser was a costume party.

16:51.360 --> 16:54.272
I walked into a black-tie dinner
as Clarence Thomas.

16:54.360 --> 16:55.918
I was in a costume too.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.514
You wore an Armani tux.

16:58.600 --> 17:01.558
I went as someone who doesn't
make a fool out of himself.

17:01.640 --> 17:03.392
How'd you not get that?

17:06.040 --> 17:07.439
Thank you.

17:08.079 --> 17:10.752
I just got my sister into
the hospital across town.

17:10.839 --> 17:13.035
I can finally get her out
of this hell hole.

17:13.119 --> 17:15.714
I personally see to it
every inch of this building

17:15.800 --> 17:18.189
is up to the highest
standards and codes.

17:20.280 --> 17:22.271
Well, that's just bad timing.

17:22.359 --> 17:24.316
Get back here! I'm sorry!

17:27.720 --> 17:29.278
Come on, fellas!

17:29.880 --> 17:32.030
<i>And then something</i>
<i>surprising happened.</i>

17:34.520 --> 17:35.873
Well, look who's back.

17:35.960 --> 17:36.949
Look, buddy, I...

17:37.040 --> 17:39.918
I barely know your sister,
I certainly don't know you,

17:40.000 --> 17:43.470
but she told me what she wanted,
and I'm gonna honour that.

17:43.560 --> 17:45.437
I'm gonna go ahead and stay here

17:45.520 --> 17:47.829
till I figure out a way
to make you understand,

17:47.920 --> 17:49.433
even if I have to get a lawyer.

17:50.280 --> 17:51.508
Not you.

17:53.960 --> 17:56.349
They're smart, they are organised,

17:56.440 --> 17:58.237
and they've got my keys.

17:59.760 --> 18:03.116
<i>It's amazing how a selfless gesture</i>
<i>can affect so many people.</i>

18:03.920 --> 18:06.639
<i>One man saw someone who didn't</i>
<i>run away from a problem</i>

18:06.720 --> 18:08.551
<i>and found the courage to do the same.</i>

18:08.640 --> 18:10.949
I got something
I'd like to share today.

18:11.040 --> 18:12.758
- Really?
- Yeah.

18:12.840 --> 18:16.276
I don't like it when Carla pinches
my nipples when we're having sex.

18:16.360 --> 18:19.033
Baby, that's... That's one of
the reasons why I cry,

18:19.120 --> 18:22.032
because you pinch them
too hard, and it hurts.

18:22.800 --> 18:25.268
<i>One man was pushed</i>
<i>to make the right decision.</i>

18:25.360 --> 18:27.749
Just make her
as comfortable as possible.

18:30.560 --> 18:34.030
<i>And another man realised it's OK</i>
<i>to be a decent human being for once.</i>

18:35.280 --> 18:37.953
He's definitely leaving for good
this time, Barbie.

18:38.040 --> 18:40.429
I'd... I say go for it.

18:40.520 --> 18:43.273
- Why won't you leave me alone?
- I don't know.

18:43.360 --> 18:46.716
The NHL is on strike, and I'm not
getting my fill of toothless men

18:46.800 --> 18:48.677
knocking the hell out of each other.

18:48.760 --> 18:52.548
Maybe because for the first time in
four years, I'd like to see you happy.

18:52.640 --> 18:55.108
Believe whatever you want.
I don't really care.

18:55.200 --> 18:57.077
Jake the Snake
is bearing down on you.

18:57.160 --> 18:58.832
If I were you, I'd step up to him,

18:58.920 --> 19:02.196
look him straight in the eye
with those beautiful blues and...

19:03.120 --> 19:06.112
...invite him out for a cup of coffee
before he escapes.

19:08.360 --> 19:12.273
Hey... Can I buy you a cup of coffee
before you escape?

19:12.360 --> 19:15.238
- What now?
- I mean... I mean, go.

19:15.320 --> 19:18.278
- Yeah. That'd be nice.
- Great.

19:20.480 --> 19:22.471
That's a cute couple.

19:22.560 --> 19:23.959
I give 'em a week.

19:25.280 --> 19:26.508
I can make sure of that.

19:27.560 --> 19:29.391
- Rat?
- No, thanks.

19:29.480 --> 19:31.357
Oh, congratulations, Clarissa.

19:32.640 --> 19:35.712
<i>As for me, seeing Jake</i>
<i>come back and do the right thing</i>

19:35.800 --> 19:37.791
<i>restored my faith in humanity.</i>

19:38.800 --> 19:41.189
I can't believe that six young men

19:41.280 --> 19:45.558
stopped to help an old lady
change a tyre.

19:45.640 --> 19:47.631
And don't you forget
who put that tyre on

19:47.720 --> 19:49.711
and tightened those lug nuts, Martha.

19:49.800 --> 19:53.156
OK, sweetie, have fun
at the swap meet. Drive safe.

19:53.240 --> 19:56.118
<i>Yep, it sure feels good</i>
<i>to do the right thing.</i>

20:00.800 --> 20:02.950
Righty loosey, lefty tighty.

20:04.120 --> 20:07.430
<i>Righty tighty, lefty loosey.</i>

20:07.520 --> 20:10.512
<i>Man. It still feels good.</i>
