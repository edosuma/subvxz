00:06.740 --> 00:08.332
How did you get here?

00:08.408 --> 00:12.208
<i>One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, zero.</i>

00:12.278 --> 00:14.940
I came across 190,
and then I came up the 110.

00:15.015 --> 00:18.348
<i>One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, zero.</i>

00:18.418 --> 00:21.546
<i>- This is asinine.
- One, two, three, four, five...</i>

00:21.621 --> 00:23.521
<i>Hey, brownie monsters.</i>

00:24.424 --> 00:25.891
<i>You guys are weird.</i>

00:25.959 --> 00:27.620
Drink!

00:32.631 --> 00:33.997
That's it for this one.

00:34.067 --> 00:36.763
- He floated it by himself!
- What else you got?

00:36.836 --> 00:39.896
Dude, my dad bought me that keg.
My dad owns a dealership.

00:39.973 --> 00:41.497
His dad own dealership.

00:41.574 --> 00:45.066
Oh, yeah? Well, my dad bought me
this magic talking knife.

00:45.145 --> 00:47.579
What it say? What knife say?

00:49.949 --> 00:52.076
Walk away, dude. It's not worth it.

00:52.152 --> 00:54.450
Is there a hole back here?
Is this noticeable?

00:56.990 --> 00:58.890
This is great. Thank you so much.

01:00.160 --> 01:01.354
I'm gonna look so cool.

01:01.428 --> 01:02.952
I bought a house in Belize.

01:03.029 --> 01:06.556
- Me always want go there.
- For dirt cheap.

01:06.633 --> 01:10.330
- Belize is a very expensive city, actually.
- It's a country.

01:10.537 --> 01:14.633
Excuse me, is this the baby shower?
I made lemon squares.

01:14.707 --> 01:16.436
Mine says, "Sweaters. All you can eat".

01:16.509 --> 01:19.637
<i>I was in the future.
It was too late to RSVP.</i>

01:20.713 --> 01:23.648
<i>What, did you two
call each other last night?</i>

01:25.985 --> 01:30.149
<i>- Check that out! Did you hear me?
- Silence, everyone, please.</i>

01:30.223 --> 01:32.851
<i>- You heard the man. Shut up!
- Ignignort, what's up?</i>

01:32.926 --> 01:37.295
We need complete silence
so your digital ruler can approacheth.

01:37.363 --> 01:40.855
- Look at him and beholdeth.
- You have all been brought here...

01:40.934 --> 01:44.392
to celebrate the bruising
of the Aqua Teens' asses.

01:44.471 --> 01:46.166
That's the reason for the season.

01:46.239 --> 01:48.571
- Now, roll call.
- Prepare to kiss ass.

01:48.675 --> 01:51.906
When I say your dumb name,
please stand up briefly...

01:51.978 --> 01:56.244
but then quickly drop to your knees
and forsake all others before me.

01:56.583 --> 01:59.677
- Here's a dumb name: Mothmonsterman.
- Right here.

02:01.788 --> 02:04.951
Did someone leave a window open?
I think I heard the wind.

02:05.024 --> 02:07.857
Boy, you better drop to your knees
and do it right!

02:07.927 --> 02:09.417
So, who am I doing it to?

02:09.496 --> 02:11.828
Hang on. Who's he doing this to?

02:11.898 --> 02:14.389
'Cause no one told me.
I didn't get to read the manual.

02:14.467 --> 02:16.765
- All right, fine... it.
- Yeah,... it.

02:16.836 --> 02:19.828
Just say, "Here,"
and let's consider the word "here"...

02:19.906 --> 02:23.842
to be short for "Here I am,
rock you like a hurricane".

02:23.910 --> 02:25.969
You do as the Scorpions have before you.

02:26.045 --> 02:29.208
- Romulox.
- Here I am, rock you like a hurricane.

02:29.282 --> 02:30.647
Happy Time Harry.

02:32.185 --> 02:33.914
- To Klaus.
- The trees.

02:35.188 --> 02:37.713
Did anyone see a large tree
in the bathroom?

02:37.790 --> 02:40.088
Yeah, they left a message.
They're running late.

02:40.160 --> 02:43.186
- They're going with Flargan and Dingle.
- Flargan and what?

02:43.530 --> 02:46.829
I told you, this wooden ship
ain't going anywhere!

02:46.900 --> 02:49.232
Shut up, Merle! Light it. We're late.

02:49.302 --> 02:51.031
- Fate.
- Flargan, no.

02:53.139 --> 02:55.004
Who is Zarnold Edward...

02:55.074 --> 02:58.532
Zarnold? What kind of... name is Zarnold?

02:59.012 --> 03:01.310
...I never heard such...

03:04.317 --> 03:05.875
Dude, you gonna take that?

03:05.952 --> 03:09.444
- Zarnold Edward Quig...
- Bros call me Skeeter, dude.

03:09.522 --> 03:11.683
Where are the Chi Os?
I thought this was a mixer.

03:11.758 --> 03:15.057
There's one right now,
and she's eyeing you like she wants it.

03:15.128 --> 03:17.187
Somebody be doing
some meat-slapping tonight.

03:17.263 --> 03:20.198
- My dad owns a dealership.
- Dude, she was eyeing me!

03:20.266 --> 03:22.757
What? Is it a little cold out there...

03:24.637 --> 03:26.400
Shot down, dude.

03:27.073 --> 03:29.871
- Dealership...
- Sloppy seconds.

03:31.511 --> 03:34.412
Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past
from the Future.

03:34.480 --> 03:37.278
<i>Thousands of years ago,
before Sigourney Weaver...</i>

03:37.350 --> 03:39.409
"Here" will work just fine, thank you.

03:39.485 --> 03:41.578
<i>- Here.
- And no smoking!</i>

03:41.654 --> 03:43.349
Give me a smoke!

03:43.423 --> 03:45.584
Stay with the patch. Your blood pressure.

03:45.658 --> 03:47.023
You tell another story.

03:47.093 --> 03:50.620
<i>Thousands of years ago,
I survived the quickening...</i>

03:51.164 --> 03:52.756
Smooth and mentholly.

03:53.333 --> 03:55.665
I know. We're getting to you.

03:55.735 --> 03:58.533
Just wait your turn.
You're coming up on the list.

04:01.541 --> 04:03.168
Okay, Brownie monsters.

04:04.277 --> 04:06.211
Emory and Oglethorpe.

04:08.982 --> 04:11.576
"Were not invited,"
is the end of that sentence.

04:11.651 --> 04:15.815
- Damn straight. Put a period on that.
- Plutonians are teh suck.

04:15.888 --> 04:18.447
Maybe the invitation got lost in the mail.

04:18.524 --> 04:20.788
- Maybe we weren't invited.
- Improbable!

04:20.860 --> 04:24.523
We went to high school together.
Did you not see the yearbook?

04:24.597 --> 04:27.327
Yeah, I know.
You told me all about the bus stop, but...

04:27.400 --> 04:29.891
Look at that.
Looks like they're having fun in there.

04:29.969 --> 04:31.903
Ignore them! We are having fun...

04:31.971 --> 04:34.735
in an important meeting
with our own league.

04:34.807 --> 04:37.742
Vice Chairman,
tell us about the new pledge class.

04:37.810 --> 04:41.075
Hi, everybody. Commence to jiggling.

04:42.081 --> 04:44.447
- I like jiggling.
- Stop vibrating, Emory.

04:44.517 --> 04:46.610
He's just trying to control us.

04:46.886 --> 04:48.877
Did anyone see an 8 foot spider...

04:48.955 --> 04:51.515
wearing a diaper
in the parking lot anywhere?

04:51.591 --> 04:54.617
<i>I did see that spider,
but when I was in this parking lot...</i>

04:54.694 --> 04:57.925
<i>it was about 375,000 years ago.</i>

04:57.997 --> 05:01.091
Down here, my Negroes.
It's me, MC to the Pee.

05:01.534 --> 05:04.560
<i>- Never mind.
- You look smaller in real life.</i>

05:04.637 --> 05:06.571
I know, man.
I been through lots of changes.

05:06.639 --> 05:10.541
I'm in hell, right? Satan says, "Go fish".
I'm like, "I don't see any cards".

05:10.610 --> 05:12.840
And next thing I know, I'm a worm.

05:13.346 --> 05:15.314
- Step directly on that.
- No, wait a minute.

05:15.381 --> 05:16.643
I got plans, see?

05:16.716 --> 05:18.377
We take these monsters, right?

05:18.451 --> 05:21.181
We start a haunted house, yeah?
You feeling me?

05:21.254 --> 05:23.188
We invite everyone to the haunted house...

05:23.256 --> 05:25.724
and they come thinking
it's gonna be all scary and...

05:25.792 --> 05:28.727
But in fact, that house is also for sale...

05:28.795 --> 05:31.320
'cause it's a condo, get it?
Like in Hilton Head.

05:31.397 --> 05:35.663
People gonna pay big-ass cash money
and then we take all that money...

05:35.735 --> 05:38.363
and buy more psychedelic mushrooms.
You feeling me?

05:38.438 --> 05:40.065
- More?
- I already ate a bunch of them.

05:40.139 --> 05:42.232
What are we trying to do?
Get me a record deal?

05:42.308 --> 05:43.741
'Cause my label keeps dropping me...

05:43.810 --> 05:46.938
'cause I keep on getting killed,
but I'm like, "I'm gonna come back.

05:47.013 --> 05:48.105
"Come on, I need this job".

05:48.181 --> 05:50.115
- Squash him, Err.
- I will be back, man.

05:50.183 --> 05:53.914
There is only one plan, and it involves this:

05:54.487 --> 05:56.387
the screw of damnation.

05:58.658 --> 06:01.923
- I found it behind the armoire.
- Of Despair!

06:01.994 --> 06:05.828
- I know where y'all live.
- The Aqua Teens shall suffer deeply...

06:05.898 --> 06:09.026
as this is bored within each
and every one of their skulls.

06:09.102 --> 06:11.002
One screw, goodbye.

06:11.137 --> 06:13.605
Everyone understands
how this will come about?

06:13.673 --> 06:16.369
Remember, there are no dumb questions.

06:16.642 --> 06:18.667
- Yeah, right here.
- In the back. Yes?

06:18.745 --> 06:20.610
The retard with the dumb question.

06:20.680 --> 06:22.875
How are you gonna get that
into their heads?

06:22.949 --> 06:25.679
Are you just gonna say, "Stay still,"
or something?

06:26.853 --> 06:27.979
No, you will say that...

06:28.054 --> 06:32.047
while Major Shake utilizes
his Phillips head death driver.

06:32.125 --> 06:33.387
- My what?
- You better have it.

06:33.459 --> 06:35.984
What is a death driver?
I don't know what that is.

06:36.062 --> 06:38.292
- Oh, God.
- Okay, does anyone have any money?

06:38.364 --> 06:43.097
Excuse me. I have a plan.
Cans go in one bag, trash in another...

06:43.169 --> 06:45.831
and be sure to split up
the brown and green glass.

06:45.905 --> 06:48.032
<i>There's the can in front of you. Pick it up.</i>

06:48.107 --> 06:50.974
- I have a can that's full.
- I'll take that, thank you.

06:51.677 --> 06:55.340
And we'll use this glass
to remove all hair from the planet?

06:55.415 --> 06:58.111
What? No, man, we're not.
He said, "Save the world".

06:58.184 --> 07:00.482
I was there,
and he said, "Shave the world".

07:00.553 --> 07:02.885
- No, he said "save".
- He did.

07:03.656 --> 07:05.624
Mutiny. And who named us Click-Click?

07:09.295 --> 07:10.922
There's a snake over here...

07:13.332 --> 07:17.735
- Okay, what have we all learned today?
- Me hungry. When we break for lunch?

07:17.804 --> 07:20.796
<i>If you're hungry, there's some
sun-dried tomatoes next to you.</i>

07:20.873 --> 07:22.500
<i>They're huge in Europe.</i>

07:22.575 --> 07:25.806
Not bad.
I mean, they're not the real deal, but...

07:25.878 --> 07:28.608
<i>- He disappeared.
- It's about damn time.</i>

07:28.681 --> 07:31.616
Okay, look.
Me feels no agenda to meeting...

07:31.684 --> 07:33.584
and vacuum in leadership positions.

07:33.653 --> 07:37.589
So me has composed 12-point plan
for good, happy success.

07:37.657 --> 07:40.854
How childish. Look, an animal bone.

07:40.927 --> 07:42.918
Bone! Good!

07:44.964 --> 07:48.559
Well, does anyone else
have any other plans?

07:48.634 --> 07:50.363
Excuse me. I have another plan.

07:50.436 --> 07:53.098
Mooninites duplicate,
reunite, and you-nihilate.

07:53.172 --> 07:54.537
Plug in.

07:56.209 --> 07:59.076
- Was this in your plan?
- I don't think it was.

07:59.145 --> 08:02.046
Square the Quad laser
and you have, behold...

08:02.114 --> 08:04.605
- the Quad Glaser.
- I thought it was "glacier," man.

08:04.684 --> 08:06.982
Yes, the Quad Glacier. That's what I said.

08:07.053 --> 08:09.112
Will you hurry up and fire?
It's getting heavy.

08:09.188 --> 08:12.646
You, with all the great plans.
You shall not see the next decade.

08:12.725 --> 08:15.285
You shall never know
that turtlenecks will come back...

08:15.361 --> 08:18.057
- in a big way.
- Hurry, I can't hold it. My legs are gonna...

08:18.130 --> 08:20.462
- Damn!
- Fire.

08:23.669 --> 08:25.102
Why do they call it the Glacier?

08:25.171 --> 08:28.299
Do you want it done fast, Err?
Or do you want it done right?

08:28.374 --> 08:30.604
I just want it done, and damn! My legs!

08:30.676 --> 08:32.837
Okay, we're moving the podium over here.

08:32.912 --> 08:35.176
You stay in your seat.

08:35.248 --> 08:38.706
The rest of you,
we're going to pass out trophies now.

08:38.784 --> 08:43.118
- Err, get the participation trophies.
- Yeah, right. My legs are broken.

08:43.188 --> 08:46.215
I'm not going to get the trophies.
I'm the digital ruler.

08:46.292 --> 08:48.089
You get a slave to do that.

08:48.761 --> 08:51.628
Who would like to join
our slavery program?

08:51.964 --> 08:53.192
Anyone?

08:53.866 --> 08:55.663
You'll get college credit.

08:56.836 --> 08:59.396
So, shoot. What else?

09:01.607 --> 09:03.871
Look, are we gonna do something here?

09:03.943 --> 09:07.208
I'm supposed to get this tattoo done
at 4:00, and I'm supposed to go...

09:07.280 --> 09:08.577
Yes. Tattoos.

09:08.648 --> 09:11.549
We shall all get tattoos of our rad name.

09:13.419 --> 09:15.944
- What is our rad name?
- I got one.

09:16.022 --> 09:19.480
Why don't we call ourselves "Let's get
off our... asses and do something...

09:19.559 --> 09:21.550
"because my parole officer really loves it...

09:21.627 --> 09:23.788
"when I don't tell him
that I spent my day off...

09:23.863 --> 09:25.694
"dicking around on the... moon"?

09:25.765 --> 09:27.323
No, we have an idea now...

09:27.400 --> 09:30.233
and we're not moving
until we come up with a rad name.

09:30.303 --> 09:33.272
<i>- Who's got a rad name?
- Gignowanasanafonicon.</i>

09:33.339 --> 09:35.273
<i>Super Awesome Villains Forever.</i>

09:35.341 --> 09:36.865
<i>Wait. Gigliowanananacom.</i>

09:36.943 --> 09:38.808
- Bon Scott.
- No, that sucks.

09:38.878 --> 09:40.903
- Banner Thomas.
- The Evil Gang of 11.

09:40.980 --> 09:43.710
<i>- Super Awesome Villains Forever.
- How about the Midnighters?</i>

09:43.783 --> 09:46.251
- The Illin' Villains.
- You know, we're out at night.

09:46.319 --> 09:49.254
- How about Got Villains?
- Nasty Midnighters.

09:49.322 --> 09:53.850
<i>- Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday...
- Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.</i>

09:53.926 --> 09:55.655
Typical. Robots.

09:55.728 --> 09:57.559
I like that name. It's identifiable.

09:57.930 --> 10:01.058
Aqua Teens,
come out and meet your doom...

10:01.133 --> 10:04.899
for we are Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday, Friday, Saturday...

10:04.971 --> 10:06.336
<i>Sunday, Monday...</i>

10:06.439 --> 10:08.737
No, it's just one week. Please stop.

10:08.808 --> 10:11.208
- Throw the screw at them.
- Yes, launch the screw.

10:11.277 --> 10:13.040
They're in Honolulu.

10:13.746 --> 10:17.341
- Shoot. Really?
- When will they be back?

10:17.416 --> 10:20.283
What, you looking at me here?
What do I look like to you?

10:20.353 --> 10:24.255
Brother, you look like a fat man
in dire need of an ass-bruising.

10:24.490 --> 10:27.288
- Nice.
- If you see them, give them this note.

10:27.360 --> 10:29.828
- Hang on a sec.
- Get your mouth off of me.

10:29.895 --> 10:32.523
- We haven't moved to Honolulu.
- You know what?

10:32.632 --> 10:36.898
They actually moved to Honolulu.
You believe that? I just found this out.

10:38.938 --> 10:41.304
- Then give me my note back.
- Did you hear...

10:41.374 --> 10:42.705
They're in the house.

10:42.775 --> 10:45.107
That's impossible.
They moved to Honolulu.

10:45.177 --> 10:49.170
- We didn't move to no Honolulu.
- Can I help someone?

10:49.315 --> 10:53.149
Excuse me,
I feel safer parking this in a garage.

10:53.219 --> 10:55.210
- Kick some ass.
- Man, you can't leave me here.

10:55.287 --> 10:57.346
Get back here! I got no legs!

10:58.724 --> 11:02.057
Okay. Who's driving me to the mall?

11:04.230 --> 11:07.358
<i>- Satan, my man. What's...
- Just shut up and fish!</i>

11:09.135 --> 11:11.535
<i>Satan like funny box.</i>
