the team to another building.

giving you one residence.

to prove yourself to us

14:35.575 --> 14:37.744
before we're gonna give you
that, you know,

14:37.777 --> 14:40.080
much of an assignment.

14:40.080 --> 14:43.283
It's a big step for us to give
you even just the one residence.

didn't include a penthouse.

This is the neighborhood
of artists,

18:11.925 --> 18:14.494
<i>lofts, crazy stores</i>
<i>and restaurants.</i>

18:14.527 --> 18:17.230
<i>I'm right next to</i>
<i>a vintage pop-up shop,</i>

18:17.263 --> 18:20.333
so I am going
to embrace that vibe.

18:20.367 --> 18:21.901
[exhales]

18:21.935 --> 18:24.037
Boss.
Nice.

18:24.070 --> 18:26.406
For this open house,
I invited 12 female artists...

18:26.439 --> 18:28.475
Hi. Hey.
- Hello, how are you?

18:28.508 --> 18:32.045
<i>- To showcase their art</i>
<i>on the beautiful gallery walls</i>

18:32.078 --> 18:33.413
that are featured
in the penthouse.

18:33.446 --> 18:36.049
- We're looking forward
to instilling confidence

18:36.082 --> 18:37.317
in some women,

18:37.350 --> 18:40.120
bringing their work
to the forefront.

18:40.153 --> 18:41.688
- Awesome.

18:41.721 --> 18:43.523
Welcome.
Thanks for coming.

18:43.556 --> 18:46.526
Welcome to the penthouse
at 154 Spring.

18:46.559 --> 18:48.528
There's three units,
and so this apartment

18:48.561 --> 18:52.499
is a triplex with massive roof
space as you go upstairs.

18:52.532 --> 18:55.702
And the three units are these
huge full-floor apartments.

18:55.735 --> 18:57.470
So this is just over
4,000 square feet.

18:57.504 --> 19:01.041
<i>You've got amazing finishes,</i>
<i>high ceilings.</i>

19:01.074 --> 19:03.043
<i>There's a three-bedroom</i>
<i>with outdoor space,</i>

19:03.076 --> 19:04.477
<i>there's a two-bedroom</i>
<i>with outdoor space,</i>

19:04.511 --> 19:06.312
<i>then there's a triplex</i>
<i>penthouse</i>

19:06.346 --> 19:08.248
<i>with an amazing roof deck,</i>

19:08.281 --> 19:11.217
which, for Soho,
is impossible to find.

19:11.251 --> 19:13.553
They bought two buildings
and they combined the interiors.

19:13.586 --> 19:15.789
So this is actually 152 Spring,

19:15.822 --> 19:18.625
and up those steps is 154.

19:18.658 --> 19:20.060
- Oh.
- So it's pretty crazy.

19:20.093 --> 19:21.461
If you go outside and go
across the street and see it,

19:21.494 --> 19:23.830
<i>this is the roof of 152.</i>

19:23.863 --> 19:25.265
You know, I think the place
works really well

19:25.298 --> 19:26.833
just 'cause it's only
three units,

19:26.866 --> 19:30.236
and then you're surrounded by
everybody who's also super rich.

19:32.806 --> 19:36.142
- This is a huge penthouse.
Did you see the whole thing?

19:36.176 --> 19:39.479
$10 million, three floors,
over 4,000 square feet interior.

19:39.512 --> 19:42.048
[background chatter]

19:44.050 --> 19:46.619
And everything
was going so well.

19:46.653 --> 19:49.823
<i>When I was doing my co-listing</i>
<i>with Luis, he was really,</i>

19:49.856 --> 19:52.425
really pissed that
I got this building from Soly.

19:52.459 --> 19:54.928
- I don't trust you anymore.
You and I are done.

19:56.396 --> 19:58.298
- What, um...

19:58.331 --> 20:00.166
what are you doing here?

20:00.200 --> 20:01.868
- What do you mean,
what I'm doing here?

20:01.901 --> 20:03.803
It's an open house.
- Sure, I just didn't--

20:03.837 --> 20:06.373
I didn't expect
to see you here.

20:07.574 --> 20:09.476
- I didn't expect
a lot of things either.

20:15.782 --> 20:17.917
- What's wrong with just
adding two of my friends

20:17.951 --> 20:20.220
who specialize
in this kind of product?

20:25.759 --> 20:26.226
<i>[suspenseful music]</i>

20:28.962 --> 20:31.664
<i>- I have some friends</i>
<i>that work at Douglas Elliman,</i>

20:31.698 --> 20:32.699
the Alexander brothers.

20:32.732 --> 20:34.467
They sell premium
penthouse projects.

20:34.501 --> 20:36.503
- I know them very well.
What do you want from them?

20:36.536 --> 20:40.306
- My idea that I'm sort of
formulating right now...

20:40.340 --> 20:41.741
- Stop formulating,
I don't like it.

20:41.775 --> 20:44.811
- Is that we bring them on
to sell the penthouse.

20:44.844 --> 20:46.913
- I've sold out 45 buildings.

20:46.946 --> 20:49.849
I've seen and heard everything,
I thought, up to this moment.

20:49.883 --> 20:53.153
I mean, threatening to bring out
more brokers for the penthouses

20:53.186 --> 20:56.022
<i>when I haven't even</i>
<i>had a week to sell it--</i>

20:56.056 --> 20:57.891
I mean, come on.

20:57.924 --> 20:59.793
Why do you want me
to sell it so quickly now?

20:59.826 --> 21:01.227
I have five more days
to the party.

21:01.261 --> 21:02.595
This is not fair to me.

21:02.629 --> 21:04.297
I can't have other brokers
compete within the building.

21:04.330 --> 21:05.765
It's very confusing
to consumers.

21:05.799 --> 21:07.367
Douglas Elliman?
No, it doesn't make any sense.

21:07.400 --> 21:08.702
It's my building.

21:08.735 --> 21:11.738
- What's wrong with just
adding two of my friends

21:11.771 --> 21:14.441
who specialize
in this kind of product?

21:14.474 --> 21:15.909
- They're actually
really good brokers,

21:15.942 --> 21:17.577
so if they get up there,
get in there,

21:17.610 --> 21:19.079
<i>what if they sell it?</i>

21:19.079 --> 21:20.513
I could lose the commission.

21:20.547 --> 21:22.148
And it's a slippery slope,
because it starts up there,

21:22.182 --> 21:23.717
he puts them up there,

21:23.750 --> 21:26.353
and all of a sudden it's like
we share the whole building.

21:26.386 --> 21:28.121
Listen, you can do
whatever you want.

21:28.154 --> 21:29.589
It's your building
in the end, right?

21:29.622 --> 21:32.125
But give me the party,
my party in New York,

21:32.158 --> 21:33.660
'cause it's the first time
anyone in the world,

21:33.693 --> 21:35.995
including me and you,
sees the sales gallery.

21:40.767 --> 21:42.669
- All right.
- I'm gonna get out of here.

21:44.637 --> 21:46.439
You can measure.

21:47.807 --> 21:50.777
- He's difficult.
- Uh, yeah.

21:50.810 --> 21:52.979
<i>[both chuckle]</i>

21:55.582 --> 21:57.650

21:57.684 --> 21:59.319
- I didn't expect
to see you here.

21:59.352 --> 22:01.321
- I didn't expect
a lot of things either.

22:02.389 --> 22:03.556
- This is the last thing
I need.

22:03.590 --> 22:05.258
Be right back.
Be right back.

22:05.291 --> 22:06.459
Be right back.

22:06.493 --> 22:07.627
<i>I'm trying to do</i>
<i>everything I can</i>

22:07.660 --> 22:09.763
to repair
my relationship with Soly.

22:09.796 --> 22:12.065
I can't get into a big argument
right now with Luis

22:12.065 --> 22:13.733
in the middle of my open house
for this building.

22:13.767 --> 22:16.569
What the f---
are you doing here?

22:16.603 --> 22:18.338
- Can I tell you something?
Uh...

22:20.440 --> 22:23.143
You did a great job.

22:23.176 --> 22:25.512
You did an amazing job.

22:27.080 --> 22:28.915
- I'm emotionally unprepared
for this moment.

22:28.948 --> 22:30.817
- The place looks amazing.

22:30.850 --> 22:33.453
The people are loving it.

22:33.486 --> 22:36.423
- Are you on drugs?
What's wrong with you right now?

22:36.456 --> 22:38.992
- What do you mean?

22:39.092 --> 22:40.360
- Last time I saw you,

22:40.393 --> 22:43.897
I'm pretty sure, one,
I was super pissed off.

22:43.930 --> 22:45.999
I'm pretty sure you were
super pissed off as well.

22:46.099 --> 22:48.535
I knew I never should have
taken this f---ing thing.

22:48.568 --> 22:49.969
- You called me
to come back.

22:50.003 --> 22:52.005
Now you're blaming me
for your losing Spring Street?

22:52.105 --> 22:53.406
F--- you, man.

22:53.440 --> 22:55.008
Forget about that.

22:55.108 --> 22:58.111
That's--that's--I already
moved on from that.

22:58.111 --> 23:00.447
<i>We parted ways very tense</i>

23:00.480 --> 23:02.649
but I'm willing to let that go,

23:02.682 --> 23:05.485
because I know
that that side of Ryan

23:05.518 --> 23:07.687
that I saw that day at the bar

23:07.721 --> 23:10.290
<i>where he opened up to me--</i>

23:10.323 --> 23:12.525
It's the real him.

23:12.559 --> 23:14.394
- There's 60,000 brokers
in the city.

23:14.427 --> 23:17.063
There's probably five of them
that I'd want to work with,

23:17.097 --> 23:18.264
and you're one of them.

23:18.298 --> 23:20.300
<i>- He has a big heart.</i>
<i>You can tell.</i>

23:20.333 --> 23:24.537
And I want to explore
the real side of him.

23:24.571 --> 23:26.373
The place looks amazing.

23:26.406 --> 23:28.608
I mean, of course, if it
would've been done with me,

23:28.641 --> 23:31.578
it would've looked...
amazingness.

23:31.611 --> 23:33.313
- It would've looked
amazingness.

23:33.346 --> 23:35.415
You're right.
- [laughs]

23:35.448 --> 23:37.350
- I think I actually
agree with you.

23:37.384 --> 23:39.953
I think I didn't get it
as amazingness as I could have.

23:39.986 --> 23:42.689
- [laughing]

23:42.722 --> 23:45.425
How's Emilia?
How's the wedding going?

23:45.458 --> 23:48.161
- We finally picked the place.
Finally. Oh, my God.

23:48.194 --> 23:50.630
It's gonna be in Greece.
- Good job, man. Really.

23:50.663 --> 23:52.799
- Thanks.
- Good job.

23:52.832 --> 23:54.601
I'm glad you're doing great.

23:54.634 --> 23:58.405
- He's so genuine
about everything he says.

23:58.438 --> 24:00.040
<i>I know that I make fun</i>
<i>of it a lot</i>

24:00.040 --> 24:02.509
<i>and that I give him</i>
<i>a lot of sh-- for it,</i>

24:02.542 --> 24:03.710
but that's everything

24:03.743 --> 24:06.046
that I kind of
secretly admire about him.

24:06.046 --> 24:08.214
I need you at my wedding.

24:10.216 --> 24:12.185
- What do you mean?
- Luis.

24:12.218 --> 24:13.787
- Stop!
[laughing]

24:13.820 --> 24:15.455
Look, your people
are looking at you.

24:15.488 --> 24:16.523
- Will you come to
my wedding, please?

24:16.556 --> 24:17.624
- Yes, but stand up!

24:17.657 --> 24:18.625
- Will you please
come to my wedding?

24:18.658 --> 24:19.859
- I will.
- Please?

24:19.893 --> 24:21.961
Did I just invite
Luis Ortiz to my wedding?

24:22.062 --> 24:23.697
<i>[light music]</i>

24:23.730 --> 24:24.698
Oh, sh--.

24:24.731 --> 24:25.865

to Greece?

24:25.899 --> 24:27.334
- I would love to go
to Greece.

24:27.367 --> 24:29.369
- He's not gonna be
my best man, now.

24:29.402 --> 24:31.705
I can't even
imagine that speech.

24:31.738 --> 24:33.606
"Mostly, I don't like Ryan."

How's business with you?
Everything good?

24:35.842 --> 24:38.144
- You know,
things are very interesting.

24:39.713 --> 24:41.548
- What do you mean?

24:41.581 --> 24:44.417
- There's gonna be
a lot of changes. Good changes.

24:44.451 --> 24:47.087
- With what?
- With...everything.

24:47.087 --> 24:50.990
Lately, at night,
as soon as I get home,

24:51.091 --> 24:52.926
I think and think
and think and think,

24:52.959 --> 24:57.530
and I think I finally realized

24:57.564 --> 25:00.567
what has been going on
in my head for all this time.

25:00.600 --> 25:02.702
It's just not the right time
to talk about it.

25:02.736 --> 25:04.304
First, I need to let
Ronita know.

25:04.337 --> 25:07.040
With life, with--
- The team and everything, or--

25:09.576 --> 25:11.378
- Everything is amazing.
Let's just put it that way.

25:11.411 --> 25:12.912
- Get the f--- out of here.

25:12.946 --> 25:15.615

<i>Everybody wants Seaport.</i>

Since my meeting with Jonathan,
I sold three more units.

25:31.664 --> 25:33.066
- You do?
- Yes.

25:33.066 --> 25:35.268
- Eee!

<i>I'm only one unit away</i>
<i>from my 25% sold out goal.</i>

25:39.472 --> 25:42.075
But that doesn't seem
to matter to Jonathan.

25:42.108 --> 25:44.377
All he's obsessive about
is the penthouse.

25:44.411 --> 25:47.380
The duplex is 4.65 million.

25:47.414 --> 25:49.149
But I'm not really interested
in selling that one to you.

25:49.182 --> 25:51.551
I want you to buy the penthouse.
It's very, very simple.

25:51.584 --> 25:54.421
If you want the penthouse,
it's 18 million or nothing.

25:54.454 --> 25:55.755
No, no, no.
You don't understand.

25:55.789 --> 25:58.158
I haven't even launched

27:19.406 --> 27:21.341
Oh, look. Big Ben.
Big Ben. Big Ben.

27:23.677 --> 27:26.846
- [kissing]

27:26.880 --> 27:29.482
Wait, do you want
to go into the pouch?

27:29.516 --> 27:32.585
The kangaroo baby?
Okay.

27:32.619 --> 27:35.488
This trip has been everything.

27:35.522 --> 27:36.723
I mean, everything.

27:36.756 --> 27:38.458
- Oh, it's beautiful.

27:38.491 --> 27:41.561
- I'm a dad.
I'm a father.

27:41.594 --> 27:43.963
It's not like--
I got it all wrong.

27:44.064 --> 27:46.633
It's just in here.

27:46.666 --> 27:47.901
- Okay, one last one.

27:47.934 --> 27:49.235
<i>- It's really a decision</i>
<i>you make,</i>

27:49.269 --> 27:51.071
<i>as a man, to be a father.</i>

27:51.104 --> 27:52.639
It's your actions
that makes you a father.

27:52.672 --> 27:54.541
Everybody says "family."

27:54.574 --> 27:56.576
- Family!

27:56.609 --> 27:57.811
- Aw...

27:59.612 --> 28:01.815
- Oh, okay!
Let's do it again.

28:03.450 --> 28:04.617
- Can I tell you something?

28:04.651 --> 28:06.019
It's a little bit less business.

28:06.019 --> 28:07.187
It's a little bit more personal.

28:13.059 --> 28:13.426
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

28:16.029 --> 28:19.899
* *

28:19.933 --> 28:22.035
- What is that?
What is all that?

28:22.068 --> 28:26.706
I don't--I mean,
it's like glass on the floor.

28:26.740 --> 28:30.043
<i>Even though my art open house</i>
<i>was packed with people,</i>

28:30.076 --> 28:32.846
apparently very messy people,

28:32.879 --> 28:35.448
not one of them
brought an offer yet.

28:35.482 --> 28:37.617
Hey. Ryan, how are you?

28:37.650 --> 28:40.687
- Good, Jeff.
- I just washed my hands.

28:40.720 --> 28:42.188
Sweet. Thanks for coming.

28:42.222 --> 28:43.656
- You're welcome.

28:43.690 --> 28:46.593
- Jeff and his wife
are film producers,

28:46.626 --> 28:49.195
and they need
something big in Soho.

28:49.229 --> 28:51.064
So this is the penthouse.

28:51.064 --> 28:52.665
It's the top three floors.

28:52.699 --> 28:54.601
It's basically two buildings
that have been combined,

28:54.634 --> 28:56.202
<i>two landmark buildings.</i>

28:56.236 --> 28:58.672
- What's the square footage?
- 4,100 square feet and change.

28:58.705 --> 29:00.707
<i>Four-bedroom spread throughout,</i>

29:00.740 --> 29:03.510
and so you have this massive
front living room.

29:03.543 --> 29:06.046
- What kind of stove's that?
- It's a La Cornue stove.

29:06.079 --> 29:08.214
- That's a good stove.
- You cook?

29:08.248 --> 29:10.150
- I make eggs.

29:10.183 --> 29:11.618
- Good.

29:11.651 --> 29:14.521
That's like a $20,000 stove
for making eggs right there.

29:14.554 --> 29:16.089
- [sighs]
Yeah.

29:16.122 --> 29:18.758
- Jeff...he's a little quirky.

29:18.792 --> 29:21.027
- [whistling]

29:21.027 --> 29:23.129
- But, hey, aren't we all?

29:23.163 --> 29:25.065
- I like
the industrial situation.

29:25.098 --> 29:28.068
It's situated very nicely,
very metallically.

29:28.101 --> 29:32.072
- If I could do a man-bun,
I would totally do it.

29:32.105 --> 29:34.607
Up the industrial stairs.

29:34.641 --> 29:37.043
You get all this outdoor space.

29:37.043 --> 29:41.448
- I like it, but I think I may
need a little bit more space.

29:41.481 --> 29:42.849
- More space?

29:42.882 --> 29:45.285
- Just like an office for
myself, an office for my wife.

29:45.318 --> 29:50.090
You know, we have, like,
no guest room here really.

29:50.123 --> 29:52.492
- Because you have live-ins?
- Yeah.

29:52.525 --> 29:53.693
- And nannies and babies
and all that stuff.

29:53.727 --> 29:54.761
- Yeah, correct.

29:54.794 --> 29:57.630
- That's gonna be really
hard to find.

29:57.664 --> 30:00.667
Like, that over there is just
under 5,000 square feet,

30:00.700 --> 30:03.703
but I mean,
then that's like $30 million.

30:03.737 --> 30:06.006
- I don't want to spend
$30 million, for sure.

30:07.307 --> 30:09.576
- Okay.
I mean, what's your budget?

30:09.609 --> 30:12.045
- Like, around
15 would be great.

30:13.313 --> 30:14.581
- I'm just trying to think.

30:14.614 --> 30:16.483
'Cause, you know,
there's two units below this.

30:16.516 --> 30:19.552
There's a two-bedroom
right below

30:19.586 --> 30:21.321
and a three-bedroom
right below that.

30:21.354 --> 30:23.223
- Can we combine them?

30:25.658 --> 30:28.762
- E...excuse me, what?

30:28.795 --> 30:30.163
- I mean, I don't know if--

30:30.196 --> 30:31.865
but let's go look
at the units.

30:31.898 --> 30:33.199
- Yeah, you want to see it?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

30:33.233 --> 30:35.502
Let's check it out.
- Yeah? Okay. Cool.

30:35.535 --> 30:37.170
New York is a big city,

30:37.203 --> 30:38.972
but it's also
very, very, very small.

30:39.005 --> 30:42.809
<i>And so people try to expand</i>
<i>their living space</i>

30:42.842 --> 30:45.679
by combining next door,
which we can't do here,

30:45.712 --> 30:47.914
or they go up, or they go down.

30:47.947 --> 30:50.483
The kitchen and living room
space is very, very similar.

30:50.517 --> 30:51.751
- Oh, good.

30:51.785 --> 30:53.219
- And then all of a sudden,
they have a duplex,

30:53.253 --> 30:55.922
a triplex,
a quadruplex, an octuplex.

30:55.955 --> 30:58.158
Two bedrooms, two bathrooms.
Lots of closets.

30:58.191 --> 31:00.193
And then you get
all this outdoor space.

31:00.226 --> 31:01.394
It's cool, right?
- Yeah.

31:01.428 --> 31:04.364
I just don't know
how we would combine it.

31:04.397 --> 31:07.200
- Or, you use the penthouse
for your family and yourself.

31:07.233 --> 31:09.202
You use,
like, this two bedroom

31:09.235 --> 31:10.670
as, you know,
for guests, et cetera.

31:10.704 --> 31:11.838
- Ah.
- And then this one--

31:11.871 --> 31:13.406
You said you need an office,
wife needs an office.

31:15.308 --> 31:16.910
- Yeah.

31:16.943 --> 31:18.078
- Yeah, that's a good idea.

31:23.249 --> 31:25.251
What does he want
for all of it?

31:25.285 --> 31:29.222
- For all three units? 18.5.

31:29.255 --> 31:31.224
- Get it for 15,
and I would probably do it.

31:31.257 --> 31:33.660
- In any other situation,
I'd be pretty excited,

31:33.693 --> 31:35.995
but I know this developer,
and he's very, very tough.

31:36.096 --> 31:39.499
And 15 million is gonna be--I
just know it's gonna be too low.

31:44.204 --> 31:45.839
- Okay.

31:45.872 --> 31:47.340
I only have a couple weeks
left on this listing.

31:47.374 --> 31:49.743
- I don't know.
<i>- So I cannot fail.</i>

31:49.776 --> 31:52.912
I cannot get fired
from this building twice.

31:52.946 --> 31:54.247
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you for coming.

31:54.280 --> 31:55.882
- Pleasure to meet you.
- I will keep you posted.

31:55.915 --> 31:57.851
[Jeff whistling]

32:06.159 --> 32:09.629
- I have to tell Ronita
something big.

32:09.662 --> 32:11.731
And I'm nervous.

32:13.867 --> 32:15.068
Hello.
- Hi.

32:15.101 --> 32:16.469
- I got you some wine.

32:16.503 --> 32:20.140
- Oh, nice. Just what I need.
- Yes.

32:20.173 --> 32:21.574
- Perfect, cheers.

32:24.444 --> 32:25.879
So what's going on?

32:27.213 --> 32:28.915
- Can I tell you something?
- Yes.

32:31.651 --> 32:33.219
What, you weirdo?

32:33.253 --> 32:35.588
- [laughing]

32:35.622 --> 32:37.891
It's, you know,
it's a little bit less business.

32:37.924 --> 32:39.092
It's a little bit
more personal.

32:39.125 --> 32:40.894
- Okay.

32:40.927 --> 32:42.228
- The thing is that,
you know,

32:42.262 --> 32:45.098
about a month,
maybe some weeks ago,

32:45.131 --> 32:47.367
I was sad in a way
that I've never been sad

32:47.400 --> 32:48.702
in my entire life.

32:48.735 --> 32:51.338
So I really this time
pay attention to it.

32:52.639 --> 32:53.940
- I mean,
you have to understand

32:53.973 --> 32:55.408
that not everybody's happy
every day...

32:55.442 --> 32:56.643
- I understand, but...
- Right?

32:56.676 --> 32:58.511
- Let me
just finish this part.

32:58.545 --> 33:01.715
There was a point that I finally
understood what it was.

33:01.748 --> 33:04.818
<i>[pensive music]</i>

33:04.851 --> 33:06.619
Okay, so...

33:06.653 --> 33:10.357
* *

33:10.390 --> 33:12.759
I don't want to do
real estate anymore, Ron.

33:12.792 --> 33:15.962
<i>[dramatic chords]</i>

33:16.062 --> 33:19.899
It's been a very intense
past couple of months.

33:19.933 --> 33:23.303
I thought it was me needing
a partner, but it wasn't that.

33:23.336 --> 33:25.739
My body was speaking to me
all this time.

33:25.772 --> 33:27.841
I've been thinking about this
for quite some time,

33:27.874 --> 33:29.175
but I've always tried
to ignore it,

33:29.209 --> 33:31.911
because real estate
has been my safety net.

33:33.413 --> 33:35.982
The things that you do
define who you are,

33:36.082 --> 33:38.818
and I'm constantly doing
the exact same thing.

33:38.852 --> 33:40.587
And I feel that
that's why I was sad.

33:40.620 --> 33:42.222
- You've built something
so big.

33:42.255 --> 33:43.690
I think it's such
a big mistake, Luis.

33:43.723 --> 33:46.459
- I know. And probably most
people would think that too.

33:46.493 --> 33:48.328
- The time is not right now.
- The time is right now.

33:48.361 --> 33:50.263
- The time is not right now.
- It is for me.

33:50.296 --> 33:52.699
When I thought about it--
- So what's the plan?

33:52.732 --> 33:55.101
You're gonna leave?
What are you gonna do?

33:55.135 --> 33:57.337
- Well, there's an exciting part
as to not knowing

33:57.370 --> 33:58.605
exactly what it is
that you want to do.

33:58.638 --> 34:01.341
- You worked so hard
for the last seven years.

34:01.374 --> 34:03.677
You hustled your way
to get to where you are.

34:03.710 --> 34:05.845
You didn't go to college.
I went to college.

34:05.879 --> 34:07.447
I understand
how to run a business.

34:07.480 --> 34:09.215
You don't, and you
still got this far.

34:10.784 --> 34:12.719
I'm getting emotional,
because it's kind of

34:12.752 --> 34:15.955
ridiculous to me
that you feel this way.

34:16.056 --> 34:18.692
<i>- It is very hard for me</i>
<i>to tell her this,</i>

34:18.725 --> 34:20.694
<i>because for the past</i>
<i>five years,</i>

34:20.727 --> 34:25.932
<i>she has put her heart</i>
<i>into my business.</i>

<i>This woman knows everything</i>
<i>there is to know about me.</i>

34:29.135 --> 34:33.073

34:33.073 --> 34:35.375
<i>And I cannot wait another day</i>

34:35.408 --> 34:39.379
that I know has been the cause
to all of my confusion.

34:39.412 --> 34:40.880
- The answer's not quitting
your job and leaving.

34:40.914 --> 34:42.082
That's not the answer.

34:42.115 --> 34:44.551
- I don't feel like
I can grow here anymore.

34:44.584 --> 34:47.354
And now I'm ready to take what
I've learned in this industry,

34:47.387 --> 34:48.955
combined with everything else
I've learned in the past,

34:48.988 --> 34:50.690
and take it into
something new.

34:50.724 --> 34:53.827
- I'm not okay with that.

34:53.860 --> 34:56.863
You're not done yet.

34:56.896 --> 34:59.699
- The bottom line is,
I've made the decision.

34:59.733 --> 35:02.669
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

35:02.702 --> 35:05.372
I'm going to finish
all the listings that we have.

35:05.405 --> 35:08.041
And once we've sold everything,
I am out.

35:10.176 --> 35:12.412
- I think it's bullsh--.

35:12.445 --> 35:14.047
That's bullsh--!

35:14.080 --> 35:19.285
* *

35:20.620 --> 35:23.056

square feet Jean-Georges.

- Hey.

35:26.092 --> 35:27.394
- Why is he here?

35:27.427 --> 35:28.928
You gotta take responsibility
for--no, this is fine.

35:28.962 --> 35:29.929
You can just apologize.

35:39.439 --> 35:40.473
- I'm going to finish
all the listings that we have,

35:42.442 --> 35:45.078
and once we've sold everything,
I am out.

35:45.078 --> 35:47.447
- You're not understanding
what you're really feeling.

35:47.480 --> 35:50.583
You've told me personal things
about people in your family,

35:50.617 --> 35:52.285
people suffering
from depression.

35:52.318 --> 35:53.953
- I'm not depressed.
- I don't think

35:53.987 --> 35:55.755
you're depressed.
But when you go through a down,

35:55.789 --> 35:57.624
you think,
"I have to change something."

35:57.657 --> 35:59.125
So what do you blame it on?
Real estate.

35:59.159 --> 36:00.694
You can't blame it
on a bad relationship

36:00.727 --> 36:01.928
with a girl,
'cause you don't have one.

36:02.028 --> 36:03.396
You can't blame it
on your parents,

36:03.430 --> 36:07.067
'cause they're wonderful.
But it's not real estate.

36:07.100 --> 36:09.202
The problem is--is--

36:09.235 --> 36:11.638
in you!
- Oh yes, I'm a very emotional--

36:11.671 --> 36:13.873
- Extreme highs
and extreme lows.

36:13.907 --> 36:16.509
- Yes, yes.
But listen to me, Ronnie.

36:18.411 --> 36:21.648
I've gambled all my life,
at the right moment.

36:21.681 --> 36:23.583
At the right moment,
the moments were--

36:23.616 --> 36:27.620
They felt so, um...

36:27.654 --> 36:29.055
When I could
lose everything.

36:29.055 --> 36:30.357
That was the decisive moment.

36:30.390 --> 36:32.759
I mean, my instinct
always grows harder

36:32.792 --> 36:35.495
when it's the worst time
to leave.

36:35.528 --> 36:37.564
When I was 16,
I have my family

36:37.597 --> 36:39.199
and my friends
and my surroundings.

36:39.232 --> 36:40.967
But I said, "F--- it,
this is the time."

36:41.067 --> 36:43.703
And I've learned,
in every single growth,

36:43.737 --> 36:45.872
and I became bigger
and bigger

36:45.905 --> 36:48.975
and knowledgable,
and I mature, and I...

36:49.075 --> 36:51.478
and I kept on learning
more and more about myself.

36:51.511 --> 36:53.246
This is the reason
I have succeeded

36:53.279 --> 36:55.115
in everything I've done.

36:55.148 --> 36:59.085
In life, if you don't gamble,
you can never win big.

37:00.720 --> 37:03.189
I was never born
to do something specific.

37:03.223 --> 37:07.560
<i>I've done skateboarding,</i>
<i>film directing, real estate.</i>

37:07.594 --> 37:11.598
And I think courage is
the ability to leave something

37:11.631 --> 37:14.100
or to let go of something
that makes you comfortable

37:14.134 --> 37:15.835
<i>for something completely new.</i>

37:15.869 --> 37:17.337
That's what's exciting
about life.

37:17.370 --> 37:19.706
I'm actually more worried
if I stay

37:19.739 --> 37:21.608
than if I don't move
forward.

37:21.641 --> 37:25.145
I cannot wait to find out

37:25.178 --> 37:28.848
what the next step
of my life will be.

37:28.882 --> 37:31.451
- You know that I don't
doubt your ability to succeed

37:31.484 --> 37:32.819
in whatever you do.

37:32.852 --> 37:34.888
- I'm gonna be fine.

37:36.222 --> 37:38.525
Thank you for...

37:38.558 --> 37:41.494
for caring.

37:41.528 --> 37:43.329
I love you very much.

37:43.363 --> 37:46.433
But I need you to trust.

37:46.466 --> 37:47.934
Have I ever let you down?

37:47.967 --> 37:50.136
- No!
- So I will come through.

37:51.838 --> 37:53.373
<i>Here's to a new life.</i>

37:53.406 --> 37:55.175
[glasses clink]

37:55.208 --> 37:58.078
<i>[intense music]</i>

37:58.111 --> 38:01.314

38:01.348 --> 38:04.551
- I know that you are buying
the penthouse from me tonight

38:04.584 --> 38:06.619
at 1 Seaport.

38:06.653 --> 38:08.188
The night has come, my friend.

38:08.221 --> 38:11.257
I got back to New York
from London yesterday.

38:11.291 --> 38:13.626
But without selling
the penthouse yet.

38:13.660 --> 38:17.063
This is it.

38:17.097 --> 38:19.466
All of it, Jonathan,
the penthouse,

38:19.499 --> 38:21.768
<i>the pressure,</i>
<i>the $300 million.</i>

38:21.801 --> 38:24.404
Like, it all comes
down to tonight.

38:24.437 --> 38:26.573
Okay, here we go.

38:26.606 --> 38:30.910
So thank God
the sales gallery is finished.

38:30.944 --> 38:34.447
Oh...my...God.

38:34.481 --> 38:37.317
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

38:37.350 --> 38:39.252
<i>It is beyond--</i>
<i>the finishes are beyond.</i>

38:39.285 --> 38:41.755
<i>The attention to detail,</i>
<i>the craftsmanship,</i>

38:41.788 --> 38:43.723
the money
that was spent into it.

38:43.757 --> 38:46.459
I mean, this is unbelievable.

38:46.493 --> 38:48.428
<i>I mean, we have</i>
<i>the cashmere carpets.</i>

38:48.461 --> 38:50.096
<i>We have the window mock-up</i>
<i>wall.</i>

38:50.130 --> 38:51.297
<i>We have the incredible,</i>

38:51.331 --> 38:53.066
<i>beautiful flooring</i>
<i>in the apartment.</i>

38:53.066 --> 38:56.536
<i>The master bathroom,</i>
<i>the five-piece master bath.</i>

38:56.569 --> 38:59.239
<i>And then the views.</i>

38:59.272 --> 39:01.207
Holy S!

39:01.241 --> 39:02.676
Can I say that?

39:02.709 --> 39:05.545
Pssh!
Pssh!

39:05.578 --> 39:06.780
Pssh!

39:06.813 --> 39:08.248
* *

39:08.281 --> 39:10.283
I mean, you gotta love
New York.

39:10.316 --> 39:14.020
Welcome to 1 Seaport launch!
Come in!

39:14.054 --> 39:15.255
<i>When I was in London,</i>

39:15.288 --> 39:17.023
my office got called
left and right,

39:17.023 --> 39:18.391
<i>people trying to get in.</i>

39:18.425 --> 39:20.427
- This is Jordan Shea, from
the office of Fredrik Eklund.

39:20.460 --> 39:23.029
- We capped the list
at a perfect 600.

39:23.029 --> 39:25.165
People, come on, come in.
What are you waiting for?

39:25.198 --> 39:26.266
Everybody.

39:26.299 --> 39:27.701
We're talking about press,

39:27.734 --> 39:29.302
<i>real estate brokers, buyers,</i>

39:29.336 --> 39:30.637
<i>international celebrities.</i>

39:30.670 --> 39:32.172
<i>Everyone is here.</i>

39:32.205 --> 39:33.540
It's like--
it's not an open house.

39:33.573 --> 39:35.809
This is an event.
It's like the Oscars.

39:35.842 --> 39:37.844
And you've got to wear
Tom Ford.

39:37.877 --> 39:38.845
Yes, honey.

39:38.878 --> 39:40.613
[background chatter]

39:40.647 --> 39:42.582
Welcome to 1 Seaport.

39:42.615 --> 39:45.719
[crowd cheering]

39:45.752 --> 39:50.523
Never before has a 700-foot
tower been built.

39:50.557 --> 39:53.593
New construction,
residences on the water.

39:53.626 --> 39:55.261
I mean, have you
ever seen views?

39:55.295 --> 39:56.396
This is from
the 17th floor.

39:56.429 --> 39:57.597
- I know.
- Imagine it going up to like,

39:57.630 --> 39:59.432
40th floor, 60th floor.

39:59.466 --> 40:01.601
I mean, actually, don't imagine.

40:01.634 --> 40:04.237
Bam. 56th floor.

40:04.270 --> 40:06.239
The door in the master bathroom,

40:06.272 --> 40:09.876
in the shower,
the shower door is $17,000.

40:09.909 --> 40:12.512
I mean, it's the most
gorgeous finishes I've seen

40:12.545 --> 40:14.147
in probably a long time.

40:16.282 --> 40:17.484
[laughter]

40:17.517 --> 40:18.952
- Why are you laughing?
It's true.

40:18.985 --> 40:21.021
[laughter]

40:22.722 --> 40:24.457
That's the 40,000 square feet
Jean-Georges.

40:24.491 --> 40:26.326
That's the new movie cinema
right there.

40:26.359 --> 40:28.361
Absolutely the right time
to buy in this neighborhood.

40:28.395 --> 40:29.396
- Hey.

40:33.299 --> 40:34.834
- Why is he here?

40:34.868 --> 40:36.836
I mean, I told my team

40:36.870 --> 40:39.072
<i>to take certain people</i>
<i>off the guest list.</i>

40:39.105 --> 40:41.775
<i>For years, he's caused</i>
<i>disrespect to me.</i>

40:41.808 --> 40:43.810
Oh, my God.

40:43.843 --> 40:45.211
- I'll talk slowly,
because I understand

40:45.245 --> 40:47.313
that English
is your second language.

40:47.347 --> 40:50.684
<i>- Yet, he's never come to me</i>
<i>and said, "I'm sorry.</i>

40:50.717 --> 40:54.721
I shouldn't have,
I wouldn't have, I apologize."

40:54.754 --> 40:57.624
We've not been in the same room
for over a year.

40:57.657 --> 40:59.192
<i>But you know what?</i>

40:59.225 --> 41:02.128
I'm gonna take
the opportunity right now.

41:02.162 --> 41:03.530
- It's a nice view, right?

41:06.232 --> 41:07.567
Nice coat.

41:10.370 --> 41:11.938
- You're saying that
you're the number one team

41:11.971 --> 41:13.206
in New York City.
You can't say that

41:13.239 --> 41:14.441
in New York City.
You just can't.

41:14.474 --> 41:15.642
- You say that every day.

41:27.087 --> 41:29.689
- It's a nice view, right?

41:33.493 --> 41:34.894
Nice coat.

41:37.464 --> 41:40.834
It's been about a year since
I've seen or spoken to Fredrik.

41:40.867 --> 41:44.671
But I have a client
who's interested in the Seaport.

41:44.704 --> 41:46.773
They buy a lot
of apartments downtown.

41:46.806 --> 41:48.308
I can barely hear you.

41:48.341 --> 41:49.843
You want to talk?
Yeah, let's talk.

41:49.876 --> 41:50.910
- Let's go over here.

41:50.944 --> 41:52.512
- Luis came to my open house,

41:52.545 --> 41:54.681
and he behaved himself properly.

41:54.714 --> 41:57.317
So I can do the same thing here.

41:57.350 --> 41:58.685
- Anyway, I wanted to talk
to you,

41:58.718 --> 42:00.920
because
the 56 Walker situation.

42:03.656 --> 42:07.160
- Eklund out,
Serhant in at 56 Walker.

42:07.193 --> 42:08.762
Can you just make sure you blast
that out to everyone we know

42:08.795 --> 42:10.497
and maybe post it?
Thank you.

42:10.530 --> 42:13.833
- You win some and you lose
some, and obviously I lost it.

42:13.867 --> 42:15.568
It's what happens.

42:15.602 --> 42:18.438
But then you start putting
on your Instagram

42:18.471 --> 42:20.940
that the former
broker couldn't do it,

42:20.974 --> 42:24.711
no units were sold,
to make me look bad.

42:24.744 --> 42:26.179
I think we're better
than that.

42:26.212 --> 42:28.314
At this point in our careers,
like why--

42:28.348 --> 42:30.617
- Don't throw that Instagram
post in my face, man.

42:30.650 --> 42:33.420
I see your posts,
and you say the same thing.

42:33.453 --> 42:35.388
- First of all,
I take responsibility.

42:35.422 --> 42:36.656
I have done that.
I'm never gonna do it again,

42:36.690 --> 42:38.692
because I realize
how tacky that is.

42:38.725 --> 42:40.293
But you've got to take
responsibility for--

42:40.326 --> 42:41.861
No, this is fine.
You can just apologize, and say,

42:41.895 --> 42:43.196
"I shouldn't have
posted those things."

42:43.229 --> 42:46.499
56 Walker was
a very dear product to me.

42:46.533 --> 42:48.401
I was given a raw
shell of a building

42:48.435 --> 42:50.437
I developed with the developer,

42:50.470 --> 42:52.539
and I designed it with Jordan
Carmichael, with Jason Lee.

42:52.572 --> 42:53.907
I worked on it
for two years.

42:53.940 --> 42:55.775
I put my heart and soul
into it.

42:55.809 --> 42:58.445
When he's showing 56 Walker
to his buyers,

42:58.478 --> 43:01.681
<i>I think he leaves out</i>
<i>the very important fact</i>

43:01.715 --> 43:04.317
that he didn't do any of
the pre-development.

43:04.351 --> 43:07.153
So it's not really...
it's not really fair.

43:07.187 --> 43:09.089
I just--I wonder sometimes
with you. I really do.

43:09.122 --> 43:12.459
Like, you buy the followers,
you buy the likes.

43:12.492 --> 43:13.626
- What--what?
What do I do?

43:13.660 --> 43:15.261
- You buy
the Instagram followers,

43:15.295 --> 43:16.496
you buy the Instagram likes.

43:16.529 --> 43:17.564
I don't like that.
I don't like it.

43:17.597 --> 43:18.832
Nobody likes it.
Everybody knows.

43:18.865 --> 43:20.867
- What--what--what--what
the--what are you talking about?

43:20.900 --> 43:22.669
- Be excited and happy
for who you really are

43:22.702 --> 43:26.172
and not, like, pretend to be
like, this big--

43:26.206 --> 43:28.108
I mean, the ranking's
another thing.

43:28.141 --> 43:30.243
Like, you're saying that
you're the number one broker

43:30.276 --> 43:31.578
in the state.

43:31.611 --> 43:34.848
You keep blowing that horn--
beep, beep, beep!

43:34.881 --> 43:36.616
It doesn't look good
for you.

43:36.649 --> 43:38.351
- So how does it work?
You tell me.

43:38.385 --> 43:39.919
- You're saying that
you're the number one team

43:39.953 --> 43:41.287
in New York City--you can't say
that in New York City.

43:41.321 --> 43:42.422
You just can't say those things.

43:42.455 --> 43:44.457
- You say that every day.

43:44.491 --> 43:46.359
- Because I am!

43:46.393 --> 43:47.994
- How many people are
on your team here?

43:48.094 --> 43:49.295
- 10.
- Yeah.

43:49.329 --> 43:51.598
I have four times that many.

43:51.631 --> 43:53.800
So it depends
on how you slice the data.

43:53.833 --> 43:57.103
- Last time I checked, you know,
you were, like, top 12.

43:57.137 --> 43:59.406
- Who is the number one broker
in this city?

43:59.439 --> 44:01.574
Who's the single agent
who sells the most? Single?

44:01.608 --> 44:03.510
- I don't know.
- It's not either of us.

44:05.412 --> 44:08.615
<i>If you're gonna talk about the</i>
<i>number one broker in New York,</i>

44:08.648 --> 44:10.817
the one guy who's done, like,

44:10.850 --> 44:14.187
almost double what
each of Fredrik and I have done.

44:14.220 --> 44:17.891
I think, like, John Burger,
Serena Boardman are number one.

44:17.924 --> 44:19.359
<i>We're talking about teams.</i>

44:19.392 --> 44:21.861
And so my number
is obviously gonna be bigger,

44:21.895 --> 44:23.697
because I have a very,
very large team.

44:23.730 --> 44:25.298
I have 40 people.

44:25.331 --> 44:28.468
I have 40 people, so what
are you so pissed off for?

44:36.276 --> 44:38.411
- The price is 5.8 million.

44:38.445 --> 44:40.780
<i>It's a 3 bedroom,</i>
<i>3 1/2 bathroom.</i>

44:40.814 --> 44:42.349
<i>2,800 square feet,</i>
<i>which is much larger</i>

44:42.382 --> 44:43.950
<i>than the normal three bedrooms</i>
<i>around the area.</i>

44:43.983 --> 44:46.553
- How high are the ceilings?
- These are 12-foot ceilings.

44:46.586 --> 44:48.355
- 12, wow.
- Which is very special.

44:48.388 --> 44:49.622
- Dramatic.

44:49.656 --> 44:50.824
- Since my meeting with Ronita,

44:50.857 --> 44:52.926
I have been showing
400 Park Avenue South

44:52.959 --> 44:54.194
like there was no tomorrow.

44:54.227 --> 44:55.462
Good to see you.
Hey.

44:55.495 --> 44:56.730
Because it is still
my responsibility

44:56.763 --> 44:59.733
and my commitment to the seller
until I get it sold.

44:59.766 --> 45:01.334
- Oh, my God.
- The Empire State Building,

45:01.368 --> 45:03.803
completely unobstructed.
- It's beautiful, right?

45:03.837 --> 45:05.872
- Yeah.
- This is the money.

45:16.916 --> 45:18.651
- Hello.
- Hello, sir.

45:18.685 --> 45:20.220
- What a beautiful day.

45:20.253 --> 45:22.689
- Yes, welcome to 100 Barrow.
- Thank you very much.

45:22.722 --> 45:23.890
Well, this is beautiful.

45:23.923 --> 45:25.258
It's a beautiful,
beautiful project.

45:25.291 --> 45:26.259
I saw it from downstairs.

45:26.292 --> 45:27.560
- Thanks a lot.
- But let's see.

45:27.594 --> 45:29.696
I came here to talk to you
about 26-C.

45:29.729 --> 45:30.864
- Oh, yeah? What's this?
- Yes.

45:30.897 --> 45:32.766
I finally got someone
to come up to the plate

45:32.799 --> 45:34.401
and give us an offer.

45:34.434 --> 45:36.636
And it's a very,
very good offer.

45:36.670 --> 45:39.572
It's not full ask,
but it's 5.7 million.

45:42.776 --> 45:45.311
W-what's with the face?
This is a great offer.

45:46.946 --> 45:48.515
<i>I'm hearing crickets,</i>

45:48.548 --> 45:50.450
and I'm very high up
for crickets.

45:50.483 --> 45:52.419
Crickets are normally
down there.

45:53.787 --> 45:55.388
They made it very clear
that this was going to be

45:55.422 --> 45:56.623
their best and final.

45:56.656 --> 45:58.692
And I know why you want
asking price.

45:58.725 --> 46:00.160
I think you have
amazing product.

46:00.193 --> 46:01.561
I think you probably
have the best product

46:01.594 --> 46:03.363
in entire Park Avenue South.

46:03.396 --> 46:05.632
But I think that 5.7
is just the right number.

46:05.665 --> 46:06.866
And I think we should
accept this.

46:06.900 --> 46:08.168
It'll look great
for the building.

46:08.201 --> 46:11.137
It'll prove that sales
are continuing to happen here

46:11.171 --> 46:12.205
and nowhere else...
- Luis.

46:14.507 --> 46:16.309
It's less than
1% discount.

46:16.343 --> 46:17.844
Of course
I'm gonna take it!

46:17.877 --> 46:19.279
- Oh!
- Thank you!

46:19.312 --> 46:21.047
[both laughing]

46:21.081 --> 46:22.215
- Yes!

46:22.248 --> 46:23.817
Ha ha!

46:27.520 --> 46:28.955
So what did you
make me sweat for?

46:29.055 --> 46:30.623
- I love the way you talk.

46:30.657 --> 46:33.059
- The beauty is always
in the exit,

46:33.059 --> 46:37.664
and this was a $5.7-million exit
with gold.

46:37.697 --> 46:39.499
Listen, it was a pleasure.
It really was.

46:39.532 --> 46:41.067
- Yeah. Thanks a lot.
- It was short but amazing.

46:41.067 --> 46:42.369
- Yeah, it was great
working with you.

46:42.402 --> 46:44.170
- Well, likewise.
I'll see you later, David.

46:44.204 --> 46:45.638
- Wait, Luis.
- Yes?

46:47.440 --> 46:49.843
- It's time to talk about
the next one.

46:49.876 --> 46:51.244
We got a lot of new projects
coming up.

46:51.277 --> 46:52.412
It was great working
with you,

46:52.445 --> 46:54.481
and I'd like to do
something more with you.

46:54.514 --> 46:57.650
<i>[suspenseful music]</i>

46:57.684 --> 47:01.321
- Am I really gonna
walk away from this?

47:01.354 --> 47:04.524
This is one of the biggest
players in New York City.

47:04.557 --> 47:07.427
This is what I've been wanting.

47:07.460 --> 47:09.662
All of these years
in my career,

47:09.696 --> 47:11.364
and now it's right
in front of me.

47:11.398 --> 47:12.899
* *

47:12.932 --> 47:14.801
- What do you think?

47:21.474 --> 47:23.043
- So what are you
so pissed off for?

47:23.043 --> 47:24.811
- You know, I worked really long
and hard to get here,

47:24.844 --> 47:26.246
to this point.
You did too,

47:26.279 --> 47:28.114
but there's something
about you that you're like--

47:28.148 --> 47:30.550
I don't know what's real.
I don't know what's--

47:30.583 --> 47:33.453
- I think you're just upset
because you can't control me.

47:33.486 --> 47:35.889
And you control everything else
that you do.

47:36.956 --> 47:38.925
When we first met,
you were here,

47:38.958 --> 47:40.627
and I was all the way
down here.

47:40.660 --> 47:42.562
And I've risen
incredibly quickly.

47:42.595 --> 47:43.563
- Yeah. You have, you have.

47:43.596 --> 47:44.764
- And I think it really
pisses you off.

47:44.798 --> 47:46.499
- No. No, it's not true.
- I think it does.

47:46.533 --> 47:47.934
- No, it's not true.
- I think it upsets you.

47:47.967 --> 47:50.537
- I am very competitive,
too competitive for my own good.

47:50.570 --> 47:51.738
But I learn things this year,
I really have.

47:51.771 --> 47:53.173
We don't know
each other like that.

47:53.206 --> 47:54.407
You don't know
what I've went through.

47:54.441 --> 47:56.276
- Of course not.
- I've learned things this year.

47:56.309 --> 47:58.144
- I have no idea
what you go through.

47:58.178 --> 47:59.813
I don't know
what it's like to be you.

47:59.846 --> 48:01.381
But it doesn't mean
you have to be hostile.

48:01.414 --> 48:03.350
It doesn't mean
I have to be hostile.

48:05.785 --> 48:07.253
- I acknowledge
what you're saying.

48:09.522 --> 48:11.424
Let me think about that.

48:11.458 --> 48:13.326
I take what you're saying.

48:16.296 --> 48:18.765
- I've done things in the past
that I'm not proud of,

48:18.798 --> 48:20.600
100 percent.

48:20.633 --> 48:22.035
<i>I brought you into a room</i>

48:22.035 --> 48:24.170
<i>and pretended</i>
<i>to show porn to people.</i>

48:24.204 --> 48:25.305
In the scene
you're about to watch,

48:25.338 --> 48:28.308
they take it for one another.

48:28.341 --> 48:30.677
If I could go back in time,
I wouldn't do that.

48:30.710 --> 48:33.246
Just like you've grown
in the last year,

48:33.279 --> 48:35.415
and I know you have,
so have I.

48:35.448 --> 48:38.351
We are in this crazy
world together.

48:38.385 --> 48:40.620
And I, as much
as he pisses me off,

48:40.653 --> 48:42.422
<i>I do admire him,</i>
<i>what he's able to do.</i>

48:42.455 --> 48:44.924
And maybe we can
at least understand

48:44.958 --> 48:46.226
each other a little bit more.

48:46.259 --> 48:49.596
When we first started,
I first met you, five years ago,

48:49.629 --> 48:52.198
it was, like, to be
at the same table

48:52.232 --> 48:55.402
with you was, like,
"Oh, my God.

48:55.435 --> 48:57.270
You're f---ing Fredrik Eklund."

48:57.303 --> 48:59.339
- Why didn't you say
that to me then?

48:59.372 --> 49:00.840
Why you said,
"Is this Chinatown?"

49:00.874 --> 49:02.208
when it was Tribeca.

49:02.242 --> 49:04.611
- Where are we? Kind of feels
like Chinatown, right?

49:05.879 --> 49:07.213
Remember I had a building
on Johns Street,

49:07.247 --> 49:08.548
and you came down here
and you said,

49:08.581 --> 49:09.749
"Why would anyone live
in the financial district?"

49:13.219 --> 49:16.022
- That was a joke.
- Oh, was it really?

49:18.591 --> 49:20.193
I think we're two
very different people now

49:20.226 --> 49:22.362
than we were five years ago.

49:22.395 --> 49:24.397
A lot of things have happened.
We're older.

49:24.431 --> 49:26.099
But you look younger than me.

49:26.132 --> 49:28.401
That's what so infuriating.
That's why I'm pissed off.

49:28.435 --> 49:31.371
- Well, you know, a little bit
of restoration here and there.

49:31.404 --> 49:33.673
[both laughing]

49:33.707 --> 49:36.910
After six years together
not being able to communicate,

49:36.943 --> 49:39.346
<i>he's actually trying.</i>

49:39.379 --> 49:42.749
For the first time, he's saying
things that mean something

49:42.782 --> 49:46.286
and that...are real.

49:46.319 --> 49:48.555
Thank you for being genuine.

49:48.588 --> 49:50.123
I mean it.

49:50.156 --> 49:52.459
It's like I can see you for
the first time in a long time.

49:52.492 --> 49:53.860
- I'm sorry.

49:53.893 --> 49:55.895
- You're doing better

49:55.929 --> 49:58.932
than any broker's ever done
in New York City.

49:58.965 --> 50:01.134
At your age, you are.

50:01.167 --> 50:03.269
I'll be the first one
to admit it.

50:08.508 --> 50:09.976
Nice suit.

50:12.479 --> 50:13.613
This is when you say,
"Nice tux."

50:13.646 --> 50:16.016
- Nice tux.
- Thanks.

50:16.049 --> 50:18.952
- I feel like there's hope that
we can put the past behind us

50:18.985 --> 50:20.286
and move on.

50:20.320 --> 50:21.855
<i>And I feel pretty good</i>
<i>about that.</i>

50:21.888 --> 50:25.392
Come here.
- Ow! Shoot, you're strong--ow!

50:25.425 --> 50:26.893
- Okay, don't make it weird.
Let's go.

50:26.926 --> 50:28.395
- Let's sell this city out.

50:30.997 --> 50:32.932
- Are we celebrating?
- Remember when I told you

50:32.966 --> 50:34.334
I had a lot of buyers
for the building?

50:34.367 --> 50:35.969
- Yeah.
- I don't.

50:44.911 --> 50:45.812
<i>- It's time to talk about</i>
<i>the next one.</i>

51:01.528 --> 51:05.365
But I'm gonna have to pass.

51:05.398 --> 51:07.500
- Wow.

51:07.534 --> 51:10.203
- And I cannot believe
I'm actually saying no

51:10.236 --> 51:13.540
to someone I was
so eager to work with

51:13.573 --> 51:16.076
for a very,
very long time.

51:16.109 --> 51:20.180
But I'm going to try
and do something else,

51:20.213 --> 51:22.315
and I mean
not in the business.

51:22.349 --> 51:24.284
- You're getting
out of real estate.

51:25.885 --> 51:27.754
I hope I didn't chase you
out of the business.

51:27.787 --> 51:29.422
- No! No, are you crazy?

51:29.456 --> 51:32.659
Are you crazy? It has--
it's completely personal.

51:32.692 --> 51:35.528
- If you ever change your mind,
I'd love to work with you again.

51:35.562 --> 51:36.830
- Thank you.

51:36.863 --> 51:39.666
Although, maybe there's someone
you should consider.

51:39.699 --> 51:41.468
This year, I have worked

<i>from, people that I respect.</i>

And I think it's only right
that I recommend

51:48.708 --> 51:50.610
the person who's going to
benefit the most

51:50.643 --> 51:52.345
from this relationship

51:52.379 --> 51:54.314
I have already established
with Toll Brothers.

51:54.347 --> 51:57.117
You know who I think
you should consider talking to?

51:59.219 --> 52:01.054
Her name is Ronita.

52:01.054 --> 52:03.890
And I tell you something,
she's going to be a superstar.

52:03.923 --> 52:05.325
And I think she'll do better
than anybody

52:05.358 --> 52:06.793

will ever do for you.

52:06.826 --> 52:09.162
- I'd like to talk to her.
- Ah...

52:09.195 --> 52:10.463
- All right.
- Thank you so much.

52:10.497 --> 52:13.133

Good luck.

- All right.
- Ciao.

52:18.538 --> 52:20.273
whether you're making
the right decision

52:20.306 --> 52:23.343
until the right moment comes
and just affirms it.

52:23.376 --> 52:25.211
All right.

52:25.245 --> 52:26.946
It's time.

52:26.980 --> 52:29.082
It's time for me to go.

52:29.082 --> 52:31.651
It's time for me to move on.

- Yeah.

with Soly,

Again, one buyer,

- You would assume wrong.
- Here we go.

54:18.758 --> 54:20.960

- What are you talking about,
a low number?

54:28.835 --> 54:30.203
It's a million and a half
lower

on the whole building.

You just sold out.

54:33.907 --> 54:37.344

That's the number.

come to you in six months...

- Ryan, stop talking.
- And they're gonna say,

54:52.225 --> 54:53.393
"Hey, I've got this
other little offer,"

54:53.426 --> 54:54.694
