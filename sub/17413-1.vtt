00:07.448 --> 00:10.300
Guess who's back from
Austin's first big tour?

00:10.301 --> 00:12.941
Oh, Trish, Dez!

00:13.017 --> 00:14.788
Oh my goodness.

00:14.789 --> 00:19.845
I brought you a souvenir. An actual
Philly cheese steak from Philadelphia.

00:19.846 --> 00:21.661
Is that mold?

00:21.662 --> 00:26.241
It was from our first
stop two months ago.

00:26.242 --> 00:32.142
Yeah, I have this thing about not
eating food that'll make me sick.

00:32.215 --> 00:33.938
More for me.

00:36.007 --> 00:38.271
So how's your album
coming along?

00:38.272 --> 00:41.140
Well, I have six songs recorded.

00:41.141 --> 00:44.865
But for some reason I can't
finish writing any new ones.

00:44.866 --> 00:48.593
I've just been distracted
thinking about...

00:48.594 --> 00:50.453
Ally?

00:51.514 --> 00:53.554
Austin.

01:10.203 --> 01:12.123
Ally?

01:15.383 --> 01:16.549
What?

01:16.550 --> 01:19.114
I was just showing the
delivery guy a new dance move.

01:19.115 --> 01:22.535
You're doing great, Frank.

01:22.929 --> 01:24.560
I'm worried about you, sweetie.

01:24.561 --> 01:27.990
Every time I come down here
you're twirling someone.

01:29.093 --> 01:32.933
What can I say? I love dancing.

01:35.841 --> 01:38.661
Austin's gonna be gone on
tour for another month.

01:38.662 --> 01:40.569
Are you sure you'll be
able to last that long?

01:40.570 --> 01:43.305
Dad, I'm having enough trouble
trying to finish these songs.

01:43.306 --> 01:46.175
Austin is the furthest
thing from my mind.

01:46.176 --> 01:49.356
Somebody order a pizza?

01:51.981 --> 01:56.001
I'm here for my
sousaphone lesson.

01:59.188 --> 02:01.589
What are you looking at?

02:01.590 --> 02:03.024
Okay.

02:03.025 --> 02:05.894
Maybe I miss Austin a little.

02:05.895 --> 02:07.162
Yes, honey.

Good night, Chicago!

04:56.396 --> 04:59.276
Ally, you're here.

05:03.311 --> 05:05.833
He's doing it again.

05:05.834 --> 05:08.310
Wow. He must really miss ally.

05:08.311 --> 05:12.465
Or he just really likes
security guards.

05:12.466 --> 05:16.546
Yeah, it's probably
the ally thing.

05:21.578 --> 05:23.307
Congratulations.

05:23.308 --> 05:28.025
You each purchased a v.I.P. Autograph
and photo session with Austin moon.

05:28.026 --> 05:29.679
Everybody's gonna get a turn.

05:29.680 --> 05:35.580
So when he gets here let's all
behave in a nice orderly fashion.

05:37.575 --> 05:38.875
Whoa.

05:38.876 --> 05:40.844
Ow! Hey!

05:42.088 --> 05:45.267
- Whoa!
- Guys! I got his sock! I got his sock!

05:45.268 --> 05:46.404
Mine.

05:46.405 --> 05:49.405
I need that.

05:50.663 --> 05:53.624
Okay. Everybody drop the clothes.
Get off the bus.

05:53.625 --> 05:56.128
Let's go. Give me this.

05:56.129 --> 05:59.249
- Not you, Dez.
- Oh.

05:59.598 --> 06:01.563
If we're gonna keep doing
these meet and greets,

06:01.564 --> 06:03.800
I'm gonna need to
wear more clothes.

06:07.078 --> 06:09.649
Hey, it's ally.

06:09.650 --> 06:10.708
Hey, everybody.

06:10.709 --> 06:12.225
- Hi, ally.
- I miss you.

06:12.226 --> 06:13.506
How was Chicago?

06:13.507 --> 06:15.646
Amazing. All three
nights sold out.

06:15.647 --> 06:18.683
I ate an entire deep dish pizza
on the top of the sears tower.

06:18.684 --> 06:21.500
And I got to watch Dez throw
up an entire deep dish pizza

06:21.501 --> 06:24.081
off the top of the sears tower.

06:24.082 --> 06:26.758
Well, I had a pretty
exciting weekend too.

06:26.759 --> 06:29.109
You know that yellow top
I got for my birthday?

06:29.110 --> 06:31.830
The cross-back knit
sleeveless v-neck?

06:31.831 --> 06:33.598
Uh...

06:33.599 --> 06:35.362
Yeah.

06:35.363 --> 06:37.208
Anyway, I spilled
some jelly on it.

06:37.209 --> 06:39.268
I thought I would never
get that stain out.

06:39.269 --> 06:44.294
But get this, I took some tonic water,
mixed it with baking soda and...

06:44.295 --> 06:47.192
I just realized my weekend
wasn't as exciting as yours.

06:47.193 --> 06:48.369
Clearly.

06:48.370 --> 06:50.226
Finish the story. What happened?

06:50.227 --> 06:52.026
I got the stain out.

06:52.027 --> 06:54.786
Yes! Great story. Tell it again.

06:54.787 --> 06:56.017
Dez.

06:56.018 --> 06:58.756
Ally, I'm only gonna be on
tour for a few more weeks.

06:58.757 --> 07:00.934
Maybe it's time for you
to use that thing.

07:00.935 --> 07:02.280
What thing?

07:02.281 --> 07:04.227
The thing I put in
the card I gave her.

07:04.228 --> 07:07.614
The thing that you put in
the card that you gave her?

07:07.615 --> 07:11.348
Guys, Austin gave me a
plane ticket to anywhere

07:11.349 --> 07:14.425
so that I could meet up with
you wherever you are on tour.

07:14.426 --> 07:15.606
How romantic.

07:15.607 --> 07:17.934
Ally, you have to come meet us.

07:17.935 --> 07:21.750
But I still have all these songs
that I'm having trouble finishing.

07:21.751 --> 07:23.965
Maybe you need a few days off.

07:23.966 --> 07:25.380
I'm not sure.

07:25.381 --> 07:27.414
- Do it! Do it!
- Come on. Please, please?

07:27.415 --> 07:31.274
You know what? I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna join you guys on tour.

07:31.275 --> 07:32.757
- All right!
- Yes!

07:32.758 --> 07:34.592
I just have to be
back by Monday.

07:34.593 --> 07:36.594
I have a meeting
with Ronnie ramone.

07:36.595 --> 07:38.382
So where's your next stop?

07:38.383 --> 07:40.802
Uh, Portland.

07:40.803 --> 07:43.701
Okay then. I'll see you
guys tomorrow in Portland.

07:43.702 --> 07:48.802
I can't wait to hear the
stain story in person.

08:03.176 --> 08:04.933
Ally, where are you?

08:04.934 --> 08:07.942
I just got off the plane.
Where are you guys?

08:07.943 --> 08:11.090
Uh, we're by gate 27.

08:12.166 --> 08:14.498
Me too. I don't see you.

08:14.499 --> 08:16.634

08:23.719 --> 08:25.879
Stop it.

08:26.531 --> 08:28.668
I don't get it. How can
we be at the same gate

08:28.669 --> 08:33.409
in the same airport and
not see each other?

08:34.619 --> 08:38.692
Because maybe we're not
at the same airport?

08:38.693 --> 08:40.643
Which Portland are you in?

08:40.644 --> 08:42.130
Portland, Oregon.

08:42.131 --> 08:44.832
I'm in Portland, Maine.

08:44.833 --> 08:48.220
There are two portlands?
Why would they do that?

08:48.221 --> 08:52.116
I don't know why they do
that or who "they" are.

08:52.117 --> 08:56.465
But now I'm 3,000
Miles away from you.

08:56.466 --> 08:58.607
That's why she doesn't see us.

08:58.608 --> 09:00.442
<i>♪ She's in the wrong state.</i>

09:00.443 --> 09:01.832

09:01.833 --> 09:05.253
<i>♪ So she don't see me...</i>

09:14.195 --> 09:15.653
Thanks.

09:15.654 --> 09:18.523
So I guess I can catch the
next flight into Washington.

09:18.524 --> 09:20.492
That gets in at 9:00
in the morning.

09:20.493 --> 09:22.921
We'll still get to spend
two full days together.

09:22.922 --> 09:25.657
Well, two days are
better than nothing.

09:25.658 --> 09:27.700
Wait, do you have enough
money for a ticket?

09:27.701 --> 09:30.577
Because we don't have a way to get
you any cash before the flight.

09:30.578 --> 09:33.031
Yeah, my dad gave me
some emergency funds.

09:33.032 --> 09:37.172
- See you guys tomorrow.
- Bye.

09:41.256 --> 09:45.690
Eight dollars and a coupon
for a free car wash?

09:45.691 --> 09:48.511
And it's expired.

09:48.928 --> 09:53.608
Guess I'll have to raise
the money myself.

You're a lot less peaceful
when you're awake.

11:21.973 --> 11:24.975

that means I win.

11:24.976 --> 11:27.077

11:27.078 --> 11:28.474
Let's see that three.

11:28.475 --> 11:30.256
Give me a three.
Give me a three.

11:30.257 --> 11:32.675
Will you just roll
the dice already?

11:32.676 --> 11:35.736
Three. It's a three!

11:36.577 --> 11:39.381
Oops. I accidentally
knocked over the board.

11:39.382 --> 11:42.537

11:48.515 --> 11:51.575
Ha! Beat you. I win.

12:14.960 --> 12:17.494
Ha! Beat you again.

12:19.280 --> 12:21.263

12:21.264 --> 12:24.801

the same bathroom schedule?

12:24.802 --> 12:26.487
So cool.

12:26.488 --> 12:30.234
I'm gonna go use the
bathroom in the rest stop.

12:59.339 --> 13:01.840
Here. Thanks for letting
me use your toothbrush.

13:01.841 --> 13:04.391
I didn't say you could
use my toothbrush.

13:04.392 --> 13:06.745
I said tooth paste.

13:06.746 --> 13:10.706
Pfft! I know. I
was just kidding.

13:10.784 --> 13:14.595
Here's your toothbrush
that I didn't use.

13:19.959 --> 13:21.793
Hmm. It's ally.

13:21.794 --> 13:23.774
Hello?

13:24.080 --> 13:26.384
What do you mean you
missed your plane?

13:26.385 --> 13:27.637
Are you serious?

13:27.638 --> 13:29.157
She missed the plane?
Aw, come on.

13:29.158 --> 13:31.970
Surprise!

13:31.971 --> 13:33.514
Ally, what are you doing here?

13:33.515 --> 13:36.325
I thought we were gonna pick
you up from the airport?

13:36.326 --> 13:39.334
My plane landed early and I
wanted to surprise you guys.

13:39.335 --> 13:41.808
- Dez!
- Don't sneak up on people like that.

13:41.809 --> 13:44.006
What were you thinking? You
scared the heck out of me.

13:45.772 --> 13:47.229
Anyway.

13:47.230 --> 13:50.170
Ally, I missed you.

13:51.094 --> 13:53.353
- Where's Austin?
- He's still asleep.

13:53.354 --> 13:59.114
Let's go sneak up on him and
scare the heck out of him.

14:05.012 --> 14:07.532
Surprise!

14:11.619 --> 14:13.719
I know.

14:16.015 --> 14:18.175
Surpri...

14:20.067 --> 14:22.189
He's not in here either.

14:22.190 --> 14:24.633
Remind me to lock the door when
I use the bathroom on the bus.

14:24.634 --> 14:26.178
Yeah.

14:26.179 --> 14:28.861
If Austin isn't here,
then where is he?

14:49.313 --> 14:52.253
I can't believe Austin moon
is actually on our bus.

14:55.250 --> 14:57.642
I must have gotten on your
bus by mistake last night.

14:57.643 --> 15:00.488
- Where are we?
- How would I know? I'm a little girl.

15:00.489 --> 15:03.755
But we've been driving all night
since we left that rest stop.

15:03.756 --> 15:08.095
Seriously? No, you need to turn around.
You need to take me back to Washington.

15:08.096 --> 15:09.625
We can't.

15:09.626 --> 15:12.469
We're on our way to the
buttercup jamboree.

15:12.470 --> 15:15.714
I can't believe I'm trapped on a bus
with a bunch of screaming buttercups.

15:15.715 --> 15:16.715
I know!

15:20.787 --> 15:22.212
Nobody's seen him.

15:22.213 --> 15:24.990
I looked everywhere.
He's not here.

15:24.991 --> 15:28.526
So he just left his phone
on the bus and disappeared?

15:28.527 --> 15:30.451
- Found 'em.
- Where is he?

15:30.452 --> 15:32.407
Austin? I have no
idea where he is.

15:32.408 --> 15:34.231
I found crunchkins!

15:34.232 --> 15:36.218
The crunchiest cheese
puffs in the world.

15:36.219 --> 15:41.439
They sell them at the
vending machine here.

15:43.809 --> 15:46.509
I got two bags.

15:49.647 --> 15:53.984
Hey, this is Austin moon. You've reached
hilary b.'S phone. Leave a message. Bam.

15:56.655 --> 16:00.591
Hey, this is Austin moon. You've reached
hilary h.'S phone. Leave a message. Bam.

16:02.933 --> 16:05.197
Okay. That's everyone's
outgoing message.

16:05.198 --> 16:07.665
Now can I please use your phone
to call one of my friends?

16:07.666 --> 16:10.238
- I can't believe Austin moon...
- I know what you're gonna say.

16:10.239 --> 16:13.438
You can't believe Austin moon
is gonna use your phone.

16:13.439 --> 16:16.159
I can't believe Austin moon
knew what I was gonna say.

16:20.448 --> 16:21.497
Oh.

16:21.498 --> 16:23.593
Hello? Austin?

16:23.594 --> 16:25.107
You're where?

16:25.108 --> 16:26.501
You're gonna what?

16:26.502 --> 16:29.864
I can't here you. Dez,
please stop crunching.

16:35.794 --> 16:38.315
Go ahead, Austin.

16:38.316 --> 16:42.466
Yes. Dez finally found crunchkins.
What's going on?

16:42.467 --> 16:44.303
Yeah, so now we're in Idaho.

16:44.304 --> 16:46.516
And they're gonna drop me
off at the nearest airport.

16:46.517 --> 16:49.507
Hopefully I won't have to wait too
long to catch the next flight.

16:49.508 --> 16:51.676
I can't wait to see you.

16:51.677 --> 16:54.249
I can't wait to see you too.

16:54.250 --> 16:57.925
I'm just bummed that now we only
have one day to spend together.

16:58.875 --> 17:03.644
Hey, cheer up. A whole day is
better than two half days.

17:03.645 --> 17:06.589
Actually, two half days
are the same as...

17:06.590 --> 17:08.093
Never mind.

17:08.094 --> 17:10.742
Well, I'll see you
in Washington.

17:10.742 --> 17:11.973
I'll be there.

17:11.973 --> 17:16.112
I just have to finish making
15 friendship bracelets.

17:22.210 --> 17:24.012
I don't see him.

17:24.013 --> 17:26.843
You don't think he
missed his flight?

17:26.844 --> 17:28.711
- Found 'em.
- Where is he?

17:28.712 --> 17:30.097
Huh? Oh, not Austin.

17:30.098 --> 17:32.313
Flame o's. The world's
hottest cheese puffs.

17:32.314 --> 17:34.617
You can only get
these in airports.

17:34.618 --> 17:36.082
Mmm.

17:41.193 --> 17:42.625
Hot hot!

17:48.208 --> 17:50.734
- Austin?
- Hot hot hot hot!

17:50.735 --> 17:53.470
Dez, shh. Go ahead, Austin.

17:53.471 --> 17:56.136
Yes, Dez finally found flame o's.
Where are you?

17:56.137 --> 17:58.082
I just got off the plane.
Where are you guys?

17:58.083 --> 18:00.385
We're by the arrival gate.

18:00.386 --> 18:03.206
I don't see you.

18:06.584 --> 18:09.106
You're in Washington
D.C., aren't you?

18:09.107 --> 18:10.653
Yeah.

18:10.654 --> 18:11.935
Why?

18:11.936 --> 18:14.590
We're in Washington state.

18:14.591 --> 18:16.151
There are two Washingtons?

18:16.152 --> 18:18.427
Why do they keep doing that?

18:18.428 --> 18:21.463
I can't believe we're
3,000 Miles apart again.

18:21.464 --> 18:23.101
This stinks.

18:23.102 --> 18:26.931
By the time you get here, we'll
only have a half hour together.

18:26.932 --> 18:29.121
Well, I don't care how
much time we have.

18:29.122 --> 18:31.133
I just want to see you.

18:31.134 --> 18:34.565
I just want to see you too.

18:34.566 --> 18:36.612
You know who else
wants to see you?

18:36.613 --> 18:39.143
10,000 fans who bought tickets
for tonight's concert.

18:39.144 --> 18:43.377
You better be on the next flight. You're
supposed to be on stage in eight hours.

18:43.378 --> 18:46.821
I'll be there in six. Okay, bye.

18:46.822 --> 18:48.706
Don't worry, ally.

18:48.707 --> 18:51.347
He'll make it.

18:53.999 --> 18:57.419
Oh... sorry. I'll get it.

18:57.632 --> 19:00.668
It's coming right out.

19:00.669 --> 19:04.483
Austin Austin Austin!

19:04.484 --> 19:07.484
Austin Austin Austin!

19:13.582 --> 19:16.840
He was supposed to be on
stage 20 minutes ago.

19:16.841 --> 19:19.851
- This isn't good.
- My plane is gonna take off soon.

19:19.852 --> 19:23.120
I can't believe I'm
not gonna see him.

19:23.121 --> 19:24.593
I found 'em.

19:24.594 --> 19:26.101
Little golden toes.

19:26.102 --> 19:28.756
Nobody cares about
your dumb snacks.

19:28.757 --> 19:33.463
No, I found Austin. I always
call him little golden toes.

19:33.464 --> 19:35.384
Ally!

19:36.187 --> 19:38.227
Austin.

19:41.614 --> 19:45.754
- I missed you.
- I missed you too.

19:49.862 --> 19:53.489
I hate to break this up, but little
golden toes needs to get on stage.

19:53.490 --> 19:57.321
Hey, only Dez can call me that.

19:57.322 --> 19:59.795
I am so glad you're here.

19:59.796 --> 20:01.970
I'll see you after the show?

20:01.971 --> 20:04.274
Austin, I can't.

20:04.275 --> 20:09.607
You got here so late, I have to
leave before the show is over.

20:09.608 --> 20:11.183
Oh.

20:11.184 --> 20:15.433
After all we went through to
get together and that's it?

20:15.434 --> 20:18.734
I guess this is goodbye.

20:38.502 --> 20:42.342
Seattle, are you ready to rock?!

20:49.942 --> 20:51.904
Sorry Seattle, uh...

20:51.905 --> 20:55.205
Just give me one second.

20:56.373 --> 20:58.333
Ally, please stay.

20:58.334 --> 20:59.855
Oh.

20:59.856 --> 21:02.106
Austin, I wish I could.

21:02.107 --> 21:04.909
I have that meeting with
Ronnie ramone tomorrow.

21:04.910 --> 21:06.631
I know.

21:06.632 --> 21:09.113
I just thought I'd
give it a shot.

21:09.114 --> 21:11.542
It's just that everything's
better with you.

21:11.543 --> 21:14.344
My singing's better.
My dancing's better.

21:14.345 --> 21:17.251
My everything's better.

21:17.252 --> 21:18.789
I know.

21:18.790 --> 21:22.853
And I write better
when you're around.

21:22.854 --> 21:26.334
Yeah. We make a good team.

21:28.299 --> 21:30.279
Sorry.

21:30.714 --> 21:32.166
I...

21:32.167 --> 21:34.867
Should get back.

21:45.278 --> 21:49.298
Seattle, are you
ready to do this?

21:57.830 --> 21:58.896
Um...

22:01.123 --> 22:02.671
My bad, Seattle.

22:02.672 --> 22:05.846
Um, just give me a second.
Last time, I promise.

22:05.847 --> 22:07.767
Okay.

22:10.073 --> 22:14.432
I finally realized why I've had
so much trouble finishing songs.

22:14.433 --> 22:16.856
I need somebody to
bounce my ideas off of.

22:16.857 --> 22:19.737
I need inspiration.

22:20.499 --> 22:22.020
I need you.

22:24.566 --> 22:26.426
That means a lot.

22:26.427 --> 22:30.094
- I'm gonna miss you.
- Wait wait.

22:30.095 --> 22:31.523
I was thinking...

22:31.524 --> 22:35.840
What's the point of going to a meeting
with a bunch of unfinished songs?

22:35.841 --> 22:41.229
Wouldn't it make more sense to reschedule
the meeting and go in with finished songs?

22:41.230 --> 22:43.764
Yeah. It makes sense to me.

22:43.765 --> 22:45.243
Well, see you.

22:45.244 --> 22:47.417
Wait, no! Austin.

22:47.418 --> 22:51.858
I want you to help
me finish the songs.

22:52.571 --> 22:54.723
I'm gonna stay with you
for the rest of the tour.

22:56.345 --> 22:58.205
Yes!

23:00.926 --> 23:04.498
Austin Austin Austin!

23:08.967 --> 23:14.629
I hate to break this up again, but 10,000
people are kind of waiting for you.

23:14.630 --> 23:16.610
Right.

23:22.557 --> 23:24.993
I'm so happy you're
gonna stay with us.

23:24.994 --> 23:27.094
Me too.

23:32.266 --> 23:34.546
Oh. Sorry.

23:38.040 --> 23:40.500
It gets out.

23:45.431 --> 23:48.479
Guys, I'm so glad ally's going to
spend the rest of the tour with us.

23:48.480 --> 23:51.217
The next few weeks are
going to be so much fun.

23:51.218 --> 23:54.335
Yeah... let's go wake her up
and scare the heck out of her.

23:54.336 --> 23:57.396
Okay shh, shh, shh...

23:58.969 --> 24:01.489
- Shh!
- Shh!

24:01.688 --> 24:03.548
Shh!

24:05.272 --> 24:07.917
Surprise!

24:10.346 --> 24:13.389
I can't believe I'm actually
on Austin moon's tour bus!

24:16.850 --> 24:19.401
Uh, where's ally?

24:19.402 --> 24:23.062
You've got to be kidding me.
