00:10.385 --> 00:11.886
[woman] <i>Let's be honest.</i>

00:11.970 --> 00:14.681
<i>You're not going for a cookie</i>
<i>for sustenance.</i>

00:19.185 --> 00:23.023
<i>You're going for a cookie</i>
<i>for the beauty of indulgence,</i>

00:23.106 --> 00:25.692
<i>for the spirit of just letting free</i>
<i>and being like,</i>

00:25.775 --> 00:28.903
<i>"I know maybe this cookie isn't the thing</i>

00:28.987 --> 00:31.239
<i>that's gonna round out my diet</i>
<i>for the day,</i>

00:32.407 --> 00:34.576
<i>but it's what's gonna bring me joy...</i>

00:38.246 --> 00:40.206
and remind me that life's too short

00:40.290 --> 00:42.167
to worry about how many cookies
I ate today."

00:48.214 --> 00:50.842
<i>And so I started asking myself</i>
<i>this question, </i>

00:51.342 --> 00:55.930
<i>"What is it that you can do every</i>
<i>single day for the rest of your life?"</i>

00:56.431 --> 00:58.224
<i>And I was like,</i>

00:58.308 --> 00:59.559
"Make cookies."

00:59.642 --> 01:01.644
[opening theme playing]

02:30.233 --> 02:32.944
[man]
<i>Christina Tosi is this force of nature.</i>

02:33.027 --> 02:35.530
She puts on her headband
and she's like a superhero.

02:37.073 --> 02:41.077
[woman 2] <i>Christina created</i>
<i>this insane pop culture phenomenon.</i>

02:42.036 --> 02:44.497
<i>Milk Bar is a bakery empire.</i>

02:44.581 --> 02:49.168
It changed the way people eat desserts
on a daily basis.

02:50.253 --> 02:54.382
[woman 3] <i>I mean, where in the world</i>
<i>did a cornflake cookie exist?</i>

02:54.465 --> 02:56.342
<i>Where in the world did a truffle ball or--</i>

02:56.426 --> 03:00.221
What is that? And can you finish it?
Or crack pie? I mean, come on.

03:01.806 --> 03:03.725
It was something your mom might make,

03:04.309 --> 03:07.896
<i>but made by someone that was, like,</i>
<i>a superstar pastry chef.</i>

03:09.564 --> 03:11.900
<i>She's someone that understands nostalgia</i>

03:12.775 --> 03:15.862
<i>and someone that wants</i>
<i>to destroy nostalgia simultaneously.</i>

03:16.779 --> 03:19.073
[Courtney] <i>She's worked for some</i>
<i>of the best chefs in the world,</i>

03:19.157 --> 03:21.034
<i>but she's also so very lowbrow at heart.</i>

03:21.534 --> 03:24.037
<i>She's very much a junk food junkie.</i>

03:24.746 --> 03:29.292
<i>And so she just put the food</i>
<i>that she loves into her desserts.</i>

03:29.542 --> 03:32.921
I remember one day buying her a box
of Take5 candy bars.

03:33.004 --> 03:35.965
Like, and I challenged her,
"How many can you eat in a week?"

03:36.049 --> 03:37.884
<i>She ate the whole damn box.</i>

03:38.301 --> 03:40.595
<i>Sometimes, she would just come in</i>
<i>with raw cookie dough.</i>

03:40.678 --> 03:43.681
I was like, "Who makes raw cookie dough
just to snack on?"

03:43.765 --> 03:46.643
And then we'd joke, like,
"You're gonna get diabetes." [chuckles]

03:46.726 --> 03:51.064
This is not food that you can eat a lot
and feel good ever.

03:51.689 --> 03:56.110
<i>But there's something about Christina's</i>
<i>baking that just overrides my off switch.</i>

03:56.569 --> 03:58.029
<i>I can't stop eating it.</i>

03:58.863 --> 04:01.115
<i>Christina is a uniquely American chef.</i>

04:01.199 --> 04:04.577
She's not trying to be French.
She's not running off to Japan.

04:05.161 --> 04:08.039
She is America.

04:09.332 --> 04:10.875
<i>And America's delicious.</i>

04:26.182 --> 04:27.267
Mmm.

04:27.642 --> 04:29.727
I mean, caramel and apple every time.

04:33.314 --> 04:36.818
-[Christina] Thank you.
-[girl] Yes! What is that? Mama.

04:36.901 --> 04:40.238
[Christina]
That's a very generous serving of bacon.

04:41.489 --> 04:43.908
<i>I was a very picky eater,</i>
<i>growing up as a kid.</i>

04:44.617 --> 04:47.954
<i>I liked the standards like mac and cheese,</i>

04:48.329 --> 04:51.666
<i>hot dogs, cereal,</i>
<i>all times of the day and night.</i>

04:52.125 --> 04:58.214
May I have a deep-fried Snickers bar,
deep-fried Oreos, deep-fried Twinkies?

04:58.298 --> 05:01.342
No judgment. [laughs]

05:01.676 --> 05:03.845
Wait, also deep-fried
chocolate chip cookie dough.

05:03.928 --> 05:05.471
And I had a crazy sweet tooth.

05:05.555 --> 05:07.557
Like ice cream, cookie dough,

05:07.640 --> 05:12.312
anything out of the oven,
baked, with sugar on top was mine.

05:15.606 --> 05:16.816
Dude!

05:21.154 --> 05:24.449
<i>I ate these very, very American desserts</i>

05:24.532 --> 05:27.452
<i>like apple pie and soft-serve ice cream.</i>

05:29.662 --> 05:30.663
<i>Like Dairy Queen.</i>

05:31.664 --> 05:34.000
<i>It was the thing that,</i>
<i>no matter what was going on in life, </i>

05:34.083 --> 05:38.963
<i>if you drove by it,</i>
<i>you were gonna stop and get it.</i>

05:39.047 --> 05:41.716
Oh, look at that. That's gonna be ours.

05:41.799 --> 05:43.926
<i>It just brings joy and happiness</i>
<i>to people.</i>

05:44.010 --> 05:45.845
And it makes that moment in life,

05:45.928 --> 05:49.432
that tiny, little snapshot in life
a little sweeter.

05:49.515 --> 05:51.642
[man] You'll be able to handle
all that, Charlie?

05:51.726 --> 05:54.020
-Oh, yeah. [chuckles]
-It looks pretty epic!

05:54.103 --> 05:55.855
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

05:57.732 --> 05:59.025
[woman laughs]

06:00.359 --> 06:02.445
[Christina]<i> I think the world</i>
<i>is more often your oyster</i>

06:02.528 --> 06:06.657
<i>when you approach it</i>
<i>with more of a childlike sensibility.</i>

06:07.241 --> 06:09.285
Wait, what are you gonna win?

06:09.368 --> 06:12.455
<i>The world is a more curious place.</i>
<i>It's a more beautiful place.</i>

06:12.538 --> 06:13.956
-[Christina] Soft.
-[woman] Like this.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.500
-There, yeah! Like that!
-Oh!

06:15.583 --> 06:18.503
It's not always sunshine and rainbows,
but...

06:19.420 --> 06:23.091
<i>within any given day in life,</i>
<i>there should always be a moment</i>

06:23.174 --> 06:26.511
<i>where the weight of the world is just</i>
<i>a little bit lighter on your shoulders.</i>

06:26.594 --> 06:27.595
Good?

06:35.770 --> 06:40.024
You know, this recipe was such a favorite
of my dad's, right?

06:40.108 --> 06:43.945
Because your great-grandpa, my grandpa,
had an apple orchard.

06:44.362 --> 06:46.364
-This was during the Depression.
-[Christina] Yeah.

06:46.447 --> 06:48.407
The bad ones, they call them "drops,"

06:48.491 --> 06:50.618
when they fall on the ground,
and they're bruised,

06:50.701 --> 06:52.120
and you really can't sell those, right?

06:52.203 --> 06:55.456
So, instead,
my grandma would take the apples

06:55.540 --> 06:57.959
and bring 'em in and either make
applesauce or apple dumplings.

06:58.960 --> 07:01.712
Grandma used to even save the peels
and make applesauce with them.

07:01.796 --> 07:02.755
[Christina] Oof.

07:03.548 --> 07:07.051
[woman] She was gonna make sure
nothing went to waste, you know?

07:07.135 --> 07:08.428
[Christina] You know it.

07:14.100 --> 07:16.936
My mom's mom, my joke with her

07:17.019 --> 07:21.899
was that I could make the same
exact recipe standing next to her,

07:21.983 --> 07:25.653
and somehow hers always tasted better.

07:27.071 --> 07:28.948
<i>But I think that's the beauty of...</i>

07:29.490 --> 07:32.410
<i>what nurturing and love and care</i>
<i>through food tastes like,</i>

07:32.493 --> 07:37.748
<i>whether it's mental or emotional,</i>
<i>or truly scientific in your taste buds. </i>

07:37.832 --> 07:40.877
They always tasted better
when she made them.

07:44.672 --> 07:49.135
<i>My grandmas, my aunts, my mom,</i>
<i>they all baked. </i>

07:49.218 --> 07:53.014
<i>Baked every day, never anything fancy.</i>

07:53.097 --> 07:57.477
<i>Baking to always have a fresh-baked good,</i>
<i>or baking to give someone, </i>

07:57.560 --> 08:01.397
or to bring when you go out,
that was just the way it was in life.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.485
[woman] <i>I guess, in some respects,</i>
<i>you would say</i>

08:05.568 --> 08:08.654
<i>she's been doing it all of her life.</i>
<i>From a child.</i>

08:08.738 --> 08:12.617
She wasn't one to want a pony
or anything of that nature.

08:13.201 --> 08:15.411
<i>She wanted an Easy-Bake Oven, and I said:</i>

08:15.495 --> 08:18.206
[scoffs] "We are not spending money
on an Easy-Bake Oven.

08:18.289 --> 08:19.874
We have a real oven in the kitchen.

08:19.957 --> 08:21.542
Come on.
We're going to the kitchen, kiddo."

08:21.626 --> 08:23.669
-Okay, sweet pea.
-[Christina] I love you.

08:23.753 --> 08:25.421
Come right up there. Okay.

08:25.505 --> 08:29.467
[Christina] <i>It's just what happens in life</i>
<i>and in home life in my family. </i>

08:29.550 --> 08:33.429
<i>And these women that have</i>
<i>this incredible power and influence,</i>

08:33.513 --> 08:36.349
<i>I just thought they were</i>
<i>the coolest women in the world.</i>

08:36.432 --> 08:38.434
[all chattering indistinctly]

08:40.603 --> 08:42.313
Oh, you got it.

08:42.396 --> 08:44.815
<i>We're not just eating</i>
<i>all these things ourselves.</i>

08:44.899 --> 08:48.069
<i>We're baking so we can go out</i>
<i>and give them to someone.</i>

08:51.197 --> 08:54.617
<i>I love baking</i>
<i>'cause it reminds me of my grandmas.</i>

08:54.700 --> 08:57.119
It makes me feel like I'm a kid
trying to sneak cookie dough

08:57.203 --> 08:58.204
when they're not looking,

08:58.287 --> 09:02.124
and it makes me feel like I'm with them
and that I'm one of them.

09:02.583 --> 09:06.462
Wow, nice. Oh, you can just smell cinnamon
in the air, can't you?

09:06.546 --> 09:10.091
-Mmm, I had one before. They're great!
-[Greta] Aren't those great?

09:10.174 --> 09:12.260
[girl] I think we should add
a little more sugar.

09:27.149 --> 09:32.572
[Christina] <i>I'm raised by women that are</i>
<i>hyper-positive and they love to please.</i>

09:32.655 --> 09:34.240
Like, "Oh, my God, it's your birthday.

09:34.323 --> 09:38.327
We're gonna celebrate you until your face
is red and you wanna go hide in a corner."

09:38.411 --> 09:41.664
Whatever little celebration it was,
like,"I wanna make you a cake."

09:42.665 --> 09:45.376
<i>But I never really thought much of cake.</i>

09:45.960 --> 09:49.964
Cake is the thing that you're raised
as a child in America to be,

09:50.047 --> 09:54.677
like, the most exciting,
most celebratory dessert you can have,

09:55.136 --> 09:57.346
and... "This is okay."

09:58.889 --> 10:00.266
It's spongy.

10:00.683 --> 10:04.270
<i>It usually doesn't have that much flavor,</i>
<i>it's usually a little dry,</i>

10:04.353 --> 10:05.605
<i>there's not a lot of texture.</i>

10:05.688 --> 10:07.982
Just like a world of missed opportunities.

10:10.401 --> 10:14.905
<i>I knew I needed to define</i>
<i>my own relationship with cake.</i>

10:14.989 --> 10:19.410
<i>And that cake could be</i>
<i>a lot better than what it was.</i>

10:24.415 --> 10:26.834
<i>Also, from being in culinary school, </i>

10:26.917 --> 10:32.006
around all of these insane masters
of beauty and perfection

10:32.089 --> 10:34.842
when it comes to finishing a cake...

10:36.927 --> 10:39.597
They had tired me out completely
to the point where I was like,

10:39.680 --> 10:40.973
"I don’t think cake should be frosted."

10:41.057 --> 10:44.352
<i>I've seen how obsessed you can get</i>
<i>with frosting a cake,</i>

10:44.435 --> 10:46.812
<i>and that time should be spent elsewhere. </i>

10:46.896 --> 10:50.024
<i>That time should be spent</i>
<i>in the actual layers of cake</i>

10:50.107 --> 10:52.026
<i>or frostings or fillings</i>
<i>or whatever it is,</i>

10:52.485 --> 10:54.737
but it shouldn't be spent on a turntable

10:54.820 --> 11:00.159
trying to make the perfect,
perfect, perfect frosted cake.

11:00.242 --> 11:01.285
For what?

11:01.369 --> 11:03.037
We're not in pottery class.

11:06.666 --> 11:09.043
<i>There's a world of flavors,</i>
<i>there's a world of texture.</i>

11:09.126 --> 11:11.212
<i>Cake should be delivering more than that.</i>

11:12.797 --> 11:14.048
<i>And when I start to think</i>

11:14.131 --> 11:17.676
<i>about all of these different moments</i>
<i>and decisions and time and work </i>

11:17.760 --> 11:20.513
<i>put into making the most delicious cake</i>

11:20.596 --> 11:25.059
<i>and cake soak and frosting</i>
<i>and crumb and filling...</i>

11:27.395 --> 11:29.897
why would I cover it up?

11:30.731 --> 11:34.026
<i>It is that dollhouse moment</i>
<i>of looking in and being like, </i>

11:34.110 --> 11:37.947
"I wanna see the world of amazing things
that's happening on the inside."

11:38.030 --> 11:43.035
<i>The little intricacies of how I'm thinking</i>
<i>about your perfect bite of layer cake.</i>

11:43.494 --> 11:46.914
So we don't frost the sides of the cake.
That's my diatribe on cake.

11:57.216 --> 11:58.718
Are you gonna help me pour the milk?

12:01.053 --> 12:04.223
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

12:04.306 --> 12:07.017
My mom was an accountant. My dad worked
at the Department of Agriculture.

12:07.101 --> 12:11.814
They were both professionals. They both
had the same job for their entire life.

12:11.897 --> 12:16.402
<i>And they raised me to be</i>
<i>a very studied, steady person. </i>

12:16.485 --> 12:18.779
<i>If you brought home</i>
<i>anything less than an A,</i>

12:18.863 --> 12:22.533
folks would be like, "Hey, girlfriend,
what's going on? That's not okay."

12:22.616 --> 12:25.494
"Tosis don't get any less than an A"
sort of thing.

12:25.578 --> 12:26.454
[slurping]

12:27.538 --> 12:29.457
-Ah.
-Nice job.

12:31.876 --> 12:35.254
<i>There was this turning point</i>
<i>nearing graduating college</i>

12:35.337 --> 12:36.881
<i>where I started to realize, like,</i>

12:36.964 --> 12:40.759
<i>"Wait a second.</i>
<i>Where is this actually gonna get me? </i>

12:40.843 --> 12:44.346
Where do I direct
this overachieving mentality?

12:44.430 --> 12:49.143
Because if I'm not careful,
it's kind of gonna be directed nowhere."

12:49.226 --> 12:52.646
And then it becomes this sad, silly thing,
where you're like,

12:52.730 --> 12:56.025
"What have I been doing
my whole life getting A's?

12:56.108 --> 12:57.359
Where is that gonna take me?"

13:00.279 --> 13:01.906
<i>I'm about to be a grown-up.</i>

13:01.989 --> 13:04.617
<i>I don’t want to suit up</i>
<i>and go to work every day. </i>

13:06.327 --> 13:10.039
<i>I knew deep down inside of me</i>
<i>that I'd die, I'd suffocate.</i>

13:11.248 --> 13:13.125
<i>And so I started asking myself,</i>

13:13.209 --> 13:16.378
<i>"What is the thing that's gonna get you up</i>
<i>in the morning and excited?"</i>

13:16.921 --> 13:18.422
<i>And it was baking.</i>

13:19.006 --> 13:22.301
And if I could do that for a living,
like, that's me.

13:22.927 --> 13:24.136
<i>That would be my dream.</i>

13:25.054 --> 13:28.974
I always felt New York City
was this energetic, amazing place

13:29.058 --> 13:30.392
where anything is possible.

13:32.061 --> 13:34.563
<i>That really helped form this idea of like,</i>

13:34.647 --> 13:37.024
<i>"I'm gonna move to New York</i>
<i>and be a pastry chef."</i>

13:38.150 --> 13:39.735
<i>My mom had a hard time with it.</i>

13:40.402 --> 13:43.072
<i>Baking was something that you did</i>
<i>every day in your free time</i>

13:43.155 --> 13:45.032
<i>once you were done with regular work.</i>

13:45.115 --> 13:47.368
<i>She just couldn't fathom, like,</i>

13:47.451 --> 13:51.497
<i>"How could something so menial</i>
<i>drive someone so greatly?" </i>

13:51.789 --> 13:55.751
And I said, "I know that you worked
your butt off for me to have this life,

13:55.834 --> 13:57.545
and I don't want it.

13:57.628 --> 13:59.255
I wanna do something over here."

13:59.338 --> 14:01.715
I think I knew that
that was a little heartbreaking.

14:02.383 --> 14:06.011
<i>But I just knew that I was gonna go,</i>
<i>and so I went.</i>

14:15.896 --> 14:20.067
<i>I moved to New York.</i>
<i>I had never been there before.</i>

14:20.818 --> 14:23.946
<i>I had my résumé,</i>
<i>which listed very few things.</i>

14:24.071 --> 14:26.031
And I just hit the pavement.

14:37.084 --> 14:39.128
<i>I was living my dream.</i>

14:39.837 --> 14:43.465
<i>And I had my Zagat book,</i>
<i>which was really the only caliber</i>

14:43.549 --> 14:46.135
<i>of what a great restaurant</i>
<i>in New York City was back then.</i>

14:47.428 --> 14:52.182
And I had dog-eared all of the restaurants
that had any sort of reputation.

14:54.560 --> 14:57.980
I just needed a job
and I wanted it to be in a restaurant.

14:59.273 --> 15:00.816
<i>I knew, once I got my foot in the door,</i>

15:00.900 --> 15:06.071
I could work harder and longer than
anyone else to get where I needed to go.

15:07.698 --> 15:11.619
<i>I'm going to culinary school by day</i>
<i>and working by night. </i>

15:12.786 --> 15:16.624
<i>And I fell in love with restaurant life.</i>

15:17.750 --> 15:23.255
<i>After a year, I finally got a job</i>
<i>at a restaurant called Bouley.</i>

15:23.339 --> 15:24.882
Four star, <i>New York Times,</i>

15:24.965 --> 15:28.719
one of the three or four great restaurants
in New York City at the time.

15:30.512 --> 15:33.140
[Christine] <i>Christina went to</i>
<i>French Culinary Institute. </i>

15:33.223 --> 15:35.726
<i>She worked at Bouley,</i>
<i>which was a very big deal. </i>

15:35.809 --> 15:37.394
<i>She did the work.</i>

15:38.228 --> 15:40.689
<i>She's so light and easy.</i>

15:40.773 --> 15:45.819
It distracts you from just how incredibly
ambitious and hardworking she is.

15:46.779 --> 15:49.406
[Christina] <i>I just, like a locomotive,</i>
<i>would keep going.</i>

15:50.908 --> 15:57.122
Just, like, pale, bags under my eyes,
and blissfully in love with this pursuit.

15:58.624 --> 16:02.878
<i>I didn't stop</i>
<i>to really consider much at all.</i>

16:12.721 --> 16:16.767
<i>I probably worked in basements</i>
<i>of New York City for over a decade</i>

16:16.850 --> 16:23.065
before anything that anyone cares about
in my life actually happened.

16:29.989 --> 16:34.159
<i>When you are in it</i>
<i>for your first five, ten years,</i>

16:34.702 --> 16:37.997
<i>your only job</i>
<i>is to be someone else's soldier.</i>

16:40.666 --> 16:43.877
No one gave a S-H-I-T about my opinion

16:43.961 --> 16:46.296
until I started working
for Wylie Dufresne.

16:48.173 --> 16:50.300
<i>wd~50 was known for being</i>

16:50.384 --> 16:55.806
<i>this super-duper, fancy-schmancy,</i>
<i>haute-technique restaurant,</i>

16:55.889 --> 16:59.643
<i>and Wylie was its cerebral,</i>
<i>creative, artistic chef.</i>

17:01.603 --> 17:04.440
I had seen what being
a great pastry cook looked like,

17:04.523 --> 17:07.026
but in my head I was like, "I don't wanna
just be a great pastry cook.`

17:07.109 --> 17:10.112
I wanna be the best pastry cook
that this restaurant's ever seen."

17:11.905 --> 17:13.532
<i>In a restaurant, if you wanna show </i>

17:13.615 --> 17:16.785
<i>that you're really serious</i>
<i>about climbing the ranks,</i>

17:16.869 --> 17:19.121
<i>there are things that you just do.</i>

17:19.204 --> 17:22.666
You show up earlier than everyone else
and leave later than everyone else.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.169
<i>And you make something for family meal,</i>

17:25.252 --> 17:29.256
the pre-meal at 4:00 p.m.
before we fed our customers.

17:29.339 --> 17:32.634
<i>I either made brownies or</i>
<i>chocolate chip cookies on the first day.</i>

17:32.718 --> 17:34.762
-This is the best jam we came up with.
-Okay.

17:35.721 --> 17:40.601
<i>Wylie comes into the kitchen</i>
<i>and he says, "Hey, did you make this?"</i>

17:40.684 --> 17:42.478
And he would give me his assessment.

17:43.187 --> 17:47.483
It does have that amazing canned blueberry
that you put into your blueberry pie.

17:47.566 --> 17:48.400
[woman] Yeah.

17:48.484 --> 17:52.112
"What did you do to get it
to be this fudgy in the center?"

17:52.196 --> 17:56.867
<i>Or, "Are you happy with the balance</i>
<i>of chocolate to butter?"</i>

17:57.743 --> 18:00.037
<i>Every day was a day that he pushed me.</i>

18:00.829 --> 18:03.123
So we started this routine where I'd make

18:03.207 --> 18:06.043
a batch of chocolate chip cookies
one day a week,

18:06.126 --> 18:08.629
I'd make a batch of English muffins
one day a week,

18:08.712 --> 18:10.756
and he would critique them with me.

18:11.215 --> 18:14.134
What's hard is the flavor
that you get of the blueberry

18:14.218 --> 18:18.639
in the drum-dried is pretty magical
when you eat it with the milk crumbs.

18:18.722 --> 18:21.183
Yeah. Compared to the freeze-dried.

18:21.266 --> 18:23.393
"These are pretty good.
What do you think about 'em?

18:23.477 --> 18:26.897
Let me tell you what I like
in an English muffin. I like X, Y, and Z."

18:26.980 --> 18:29.817
And he would pick apart
every little part of an English muffin.

18:29.900 --> 18:32.069
I thought that the drum-dried
tasted better, too.

18:32.152 --> 18:33.320
There's something when you...

18:33.403 --> 18:37.574
It's magical. Makes you wanna
close your eyes and take a deep breath.

18:38.534 --> 18:40.786
<i>And it wasn't until I started working</i>
<i>at wd~50</i>

18:40.869 --> 18:45.916
<i>that my curiosity with how food is made</i>
<i>really started to come.</i>

18:56.510 --> 18:58.554
[clicking tongue]

19:11.150 --> 19:12.526
All right.

19:20.367 --> 19:24.496
One Sunday, I came in,
was gonna go make family meal,

19:24.580 --> 19:27.833
and I open our fridge, and there's
not really anything in the fridge.

19:29.501 --> 19:32.337
<i>I became obsessed with reading about pies</i>
<i>from different regions,</i>

19:32.421 --> 19:36.675
<i>and reading about this chess pie,</i>
<i>this American dessert</i>

19:36.758 --> 19:40.345
that they make down south
when they don't really have anything left.

19:42.764 --> 19:46.143
<i>And I loved the idea of it,</i>
<i>'cause it's Sunday, I got nothing,</i>

19:46.226 --> 19:49.229
<i>I need to make a pie</i>
<i>with nothing to make a pie with.</i>

19:50.522 --> 19:56.361
<i>And I decide that I'm gonna make</i>
<i>this buttery, gooey, sugary filling.</i>

19:56.987 --> 20:01.408
<i>I grabbed some freeze-dried corn that we</i>
<i>were making cornbread ice cream with</i>

20:01.491 --> 20:03.702
<i>and I threw that in the filling.</i>

20:03.785 --> 20:06.330
Truth be told,
I kind of didn't really measure anything.

20:06.413 --> 20:09.499
I was just kind of being very spiritual
about the moment,

20:09.583 --> 20:13.378
<i>which is oftentimes what I did</i>
<i>when I baked for family meal,</i>

20:13.462 --> 20:16.048
because the rest of the day
was so precise.

20:18.967 --> 20:21.136
For me, all I wanted to do was be myself,

20:21.220 --> 20:23.889
but I wanted to be myself
in this community of people.

20:24.765 --> 20:29.019
<i>It's your rite of passage with them,</i>
<i>for them to believe that you're talented,</i>

20:29.102 --> 20:31.563
<i>and for them to believe you know</i>
<i>what good food tastes like.</i>

20:36.818 --> 20:41.657
<i>I baked the pie</i>
<i>and the filling never quite set, </i>

20:42.866 --> 20:44.952
but it smelled really good, so I was like,

20:45.035 --> 20:48.038
"All right, I need to pull this pie out.
It's gonna start burning if I don't."

20:48.121 --> 20:50.916
So, I pull it out
and I throw it in the freezer

20:50.999 --> 20:54.127
in hopes that the filling,
the center, will just set thick enough

20:54.211 --> 20:57.631
that I'm not serving
this atrocious, soupy pie.

20:57.714 --> 20:59.883
Like, you can't put that up
for family meal.

21:00.884 --> 21:02.636
<i>And a few minutes into family meal,</i>

21:02.719 --> 21:06.014
<i>I start hearing these noises</i>
<i>in the kitchen.</i>

21:06.306 --> 21:10.143
<i>And one of my buddies is like,</i>

21:10.519 --> 21:13.438
"Did you make that pie
that's up there on the table?"

21:13.522 --> 21:17.859
And I'm like, "Yeah, I know.
It's not perfect, it's not awesome."

21:17.943 --> 21:21.154
He's like, "You gotta go into the kitchen.
People are freaking out right now."

21:21.697 --> 21:24.199
<i>And the rest of these guys,</i>

21:24.283 --> 21:26.868
they're taking a slice
and they're pushing it away from them.

21:26.952 --> 21:29.246
Like, "Do not let me have
any more of that pie."

21:30.497 --> 21:34.793
And this Australian cook was like,
"I don't know what you just did,

21:34.876 --> 21:37.462
but this pie is like crack.
It's crack pie."

21:38.213 --> 21:42.009
<i>It became this underground</i>
<i>wd~50 family meal dessert</i>

21:42.092 --> 21:43.969
<i>that I made on Sundays.</i>

22:03.071 --> 22:04.072
Hey, how are you?

22:04.156 --> 22:05.574
[man] Hi. What can I get you?

22:05.657 --> 22:11.330
May I have an everything bagel
with scallion cream cheese?

22:11.413 --> 22:12.748
You want it toasted?

22:12.831 --> 22:16.418
Uh, not toasted. Um, bacon and tomato.

22:20.922 --> 22:23.342
<i>I was working at wd~50,</i>

22:23.425 --> 22:27.596
<i>and I had been there</i>
<i>for just shy of two years, </i>

22:28.221 --> 22:31.975
and something happened where I had pushed
and pushed and pushed and pushed.

22:32.059 --> 22:37.606
And the only other step I could take
was the step to become the pastry chef,

22:37.689 --> 22:40.233
and I wasn't interested in it.

22:45.030 --> 22:49.659
<i>The dream was to move to New York</i>
<i>to become a pastry chef.</i>

22:49.743 --> 22:51.953
Did I really know what that meant? Um, no.

22:52.954 --> 22:55.582
-[man] Thank you very much.
-[Christina] Thank you.

22:56.541 --> 23:00.545
<i>Going to culinary school, they teach you</i>
<i>the fanciest of French techniques.</i>

23:01.129 --> 23:03.673
In working at Bouley,
there's no cookies there.

23:03.757 --> 23:04.591
That's not a thing.

23:06.385 --> 23:11.556
<i>And I think, when I slowed down,</i>
<i>I realized that being the pastry chef</i>

23:11.640 --> 23:16.770
of an incredibly cutting-edge restaurant
was just not who I was.

23:23.902 --> 23:26.029
<i>I had worked my butt off.</i>

23:27.656 --> 23:29.991
<i>I stayed in New York. I never left.</i>

23:30.409 --> 23:34.496
I missed weddings and birthdays
and births and holidays

23:34.579 --> 23:37.290
<i>and everything for a very long time.</i>

23:39.876 --> 23:46.258
I remember wishing that I had friends
or family that lived in the city.

23:49.803 --> 23:51.847
<i>It's a very solitary life.</i>

23:56.309 --> 23:59.771
<i>Early on, I would fill that loneliness</i>
<i>with work.</i>

23:59.855 --> 24:04.109
But at some point I realized that
that is probably

24:04.192 --> 24:08.530
the most boring, one-dimensional thing
a human being can be,

24:08.989 --> 24:11.116
and that I was becoming that.

24:24.129 --> 24:26.756
<i>At that time,</i>
<i>I was a little bit in a space</i>

24:26.840 --> 24:29.676
<i>of not really knowing</i>
<i>what my next step was.</i>

24:29.759 --> 24:33.054
<i>I was so zoomed in.</i>
<i>I knew I needed to kind of zoom out.</i>

24:45.775 --> 24:48.486
<i>Because I had poked and prodded Wylie</i>

24:48.570 --> 24:53.575
<i>to give me whatever side jobs</i>
<i>that he needed help with,</i>

24:53.658 --> 24:56.161
<i>I had experience</i>
<i>working with the health department.</i>

24:56.912 --> 24:59.414
<i>And, one day, he said,</i>
<i>"My buddy needs some help.</i>

24:59.497 --> 25:01.791
<i>Do you mind going up there</i>
<i>and just sussing it out?</i>

25:01.875 --> 25:03.543
<i>I'm not really sure what's going on."</i>

25:04.085 --> 25:10.091
I basically was put on double
secret probation by the health department.

25:10.467 --> 25:12.052
And I was in hell.

25:12.844 --> 25:16.640
<i>This is when Momofuku was</i>
<i>really flying by the seat of its pants,</i>

25:16.723 --> 25:17.933
<i>and we needed help.</i>

25:18.642 --> 25:23.021
I called Wylie Dufresne, and he's like,
"I have someone that can help you out."

25:23.980 --> 25:28.860
[Christina]<i> I remember going in for lunch</i>
<i>because I wanted to check this guy out.</i>

25:28.944 --> 25:32.530
And Dave was just crushing a cook,

25:32.614 --> 25:36.201
just laying into him
because something wasn't done properly.

25:37.202 --> 25:41.748
A few minutes later, he's pushing everyone
out of the way in the kitchen,

25:41.831 --> 25:45.418
and he's got a mop in one hand
and a bottle of all-purpose cleaner,

25:45.502 --> 25:48.630
spraying down the floor
and mopping the floor vigorously.

25:49.089 --> 25:52.634
<i>He's the one in there,</i>
<i>just grinding it out.</i>

25:53.176 --> 25:59.224
And that's the salt-of-the-earth stuff
that I was raised to be like and for.

26:00.225 --> 26:04.771
<i>I knew that I would do whatever I could</i>
<i>to help this guy out.</i>

26:04.854 --> 26:06.356
[David]<i> I hired her specifically</i>

26:06.439 --> 26:09.359
to get me back into the good graces
of the health department.

26:09.442 --> 26:10.610
She was so great at it.

26:10.694 --> 26:13.113
I was like, "My God, I need someone
to help me in the office.

26:13.196 --> 26:16.116
<i>You're so good at paperwork stuff.</i>
<i>Can you help me out here?"</i>

26:17.617 --> 26:22.706
He took me out to lunch
and offered me a job.

26:24.833 --> 26:26.084
[Christina] How's it looking?

26:26.167 --> 26:28.295
[man] Great. Just doing the final scrape.

26:31.006 --> 26:32.048
So good.

26:35.969 --> 26:37.804
-[woman] Thank you.
-[Christina] Smells delicious.

26:37.887 --> 26:39.514
-Thank you.
-Yep.

26:42.225 --> 26:44.269
Hi. Hi, guys.

26:44.352 --> 26:45.437
Hello.

26:45.520 --> 26:48.440
-Everything going okay? <i>¿Todo bien?</i>
<i>-Sí.</i>

26:51.401 --> 26:54.154
<i>The job with Dave</i>
<i>was a different kind of job.</i>

26:54.237 --> 26:59.617
<i>It was becoming a facilities manager,</i>
<i>becoming the director of operations.</i>

26:59.701 --> 27:01.411
I was helping run a business.

27:02.495 --> 27:07.083
So, in a weird way,
my bakingness retreated.

27:08.251 --> 27:13.048
<i>After week two,</i>
<i>Dave realized that he was getting,</i>

27:13.131 --> 27:15.925
<i>maybe, a slightly different version of me.</i>

27:16.634 --> 27:18.887
<i>Dave just straight-up called me out</i>

27:18.970 --> 27:22.182
<i>and was like, "Hey, you used to be</i>
<i>a pastry cook for Wylie.</i>

27:22.265 --> 27:25.018
<i>He tells me all of these things</i>
<i>that you used to do.</i>

27:25.101 --> 27:29.147
Where's my family meal?
Where are my cookies? WTF?"

27:32.275 --> 27:35.403
<i>I go home,</i>
<i>and I just cut to the chase and bake.</i>

27:35.987 --> 27:40.241
<i>And the next day,</i>
<i>I brought in miso crack pie.</i>

27:41.659 --> 27:44.371
She made a sweet miso salty pie.

27:44.454 --> 27:47.999
I tasted it, and I was like, "Who the hell
would make something like this?"

27:49.084 --> 27:50.418
<i>Someone insanely creative,</i>

27:50.919 --> 27:54.506
<i>but also someone</i>
<i>that has a strong personality.</i>

27:55.799 --> 27:59.928
<i>I brought it in and everyone ate it</i>
<i>in two seconds flat.</i>

28:00.553 --> 28:03.306
<i>And once I made that miso crack pie,</i>

28:03.390 --> 28:06.726
<i>I just made dessert and brought it in</i>
<i>every day for family meal.</i>

28:09.688 --> 28:12.524
<i>One day, Dave called me into the office</i>

28:12.607 --> 28:15.985
and he's crushing whatever dessert
I brought in,

28:16.069 --> 28:19.989
<i>and with his mouth full</i>
<i>because when he gets really excited,</i>

28:20.073 --> 28:22.075
he can't wait to share his thought.

28:23.993 --> 28:26.913
He was like, "I don't understand.
Let's just put this on the menu."

28:29.416 --> 28:30.667
<i>But it would be something</i>

28:30.750 --> 28:34.379
<i>that I would be horrified at ever thinking</i>
<i>about putting on a menu.</i>

28:35.713 --> 28:40.510
<i>Those are the things that I would make</i>
<i>for myself, and it wasn't fancy food.</i>

28:40.760 --> 28:42.971
And I was like,
"No, that's not a good idea."

28:44.556 --> 28:47.851
<i>He did this with me every day</i>
<i>for that week.</i>

28:47.934 --> 28:50.353
"How about this?
This one should go on the menu."

28:50.437 --> 28:53.064
I'd be like, "I don't think so.
It's not a thing."

28:54.399 --> 28:56.609
[David] <i>It was maddening for myself</i>
<i>'cause, finally,</i>

28:56.693 --> 28:59.404
I have someone
that obviously loves cooking.

28:59.487 --> 29:02.323
That was the most important thing.
She fucking loves to cook.

29:02.407 --> 29:04.242
She loves it, but she refused to do it.

29:06.202 --> 29:08.955
<i>And I remember, probably it taking</i>
<i>a month or two to being, like,</i>

29:09.038 --> 29:10.957
<i>"I'm sorry, I'm not taking no</i>
<i>for an answer right now.</i>

29:11.040 --> 29:13.585
<i>Your food is gonna be on the menu tonight.</i>

29:13.668 --> 29:16.087
You got like three hours to..." [chuckles]

29:17.213 --> 29:18.673
"...to produce enough for service.

29:18.757 --> 29:20.175
And you better get started."

29:20.717 --> 29:24.137
[Christina]<i> I had to figure something out,</i>
<i>and I had to figure it out pretty quickly.</i>

29:24.220 --> 29:29.559
<i>So, I decided to just make a super-duper</i>
<i>American strawberry shortcake.</i>

29:29.642 --> 29:31.394
<i>It's rolled in a little</i>
<i>confectioners' sugar,</i>

29:31.478 --> 29:33.480
<i>which is what my grandma would do.</i>

29:34.230 --> 29:37.442
[Christine] <i>You have to understand</i>
<i>Ssäm Bar and Chang at the time.</i>

29:37.525 --> 29:40.069
<i>You'd go in, it was super loud,</i>
<i>there's tons of music,</i>

29:40.153 --> 29:42.030
<i>and the food was sort of the equivalent.</i>

29:42.113 --> 29:45.867
They didn't give a shit.
They had one kind of wine, you know,

29:45.950 --> 29:49.245
and at the end of the meal,
they put down this mochi ice cream,

29:49.329 --> 29:52.791
which was probably from the Trader Joe's
around the corner on 14th Street,

29:52.874 --> 29:55.376
so you're just, like,
"Mmm, here's your dessert. Thanks."

29:58.254 --> 30:03.051
<i>And then one day, there was</i>
<i>this strawberry shortcake on a plate.</i>

30:03.134 --> 30:04.761
<i>It wasn't just a strawberry shortcake.</i>

30:04.844 --> 30:09.432
There were layers of intelligence
with crazy going on,

30:09.516 --> 30:11.017
which was the Ssäm experience.

30:11.684 --> 30:13.895
<i>So she perfectly complemented him.</i>

30:15.814 --> 30:17.690
[David] <i>What dawned on me</i>
<i>very quickly with Christina</i>

30:17.774 --> 30:22.111
was that here was a person that still
needed an outlet to express herself.

30:24.864 --> 30:26.032
<i>That's when I realized,</i>

30:26.115 --> 30:29.786
<i>"Oh, the only way to get her to do it</i>
<i>is just to push her off the cliff."</i>

30:45.093 --> 30:49.472
[Christina]<i> One day, as we were conceiving</i>
<i>how we would build this Momofuku empire,</i>

30:50.890 --> 30:54.018
we had decided to open
a tasting menu-only restaurant,

30:54.102 --> 30:55.395
and so we were building it out.

30:56.229 --> 30:58.231
<i>It's a highly anticipated opening,</i>

30:58.314 --> 31:01.526
<i>and I was gonna be responsible</i>
<i>for making dessert.</i>

31:04.863 --> 31:09.534
<i>There's this bodega in the East Village.</i>
<i>It's open 24/7.</i>

31:09.617 --> 31:12.704
It feels like it has every ingredient
under the sun.

31:14.581 --> 31:20.837
<i>And it's oftentimes where I go</i>
<i>when I'm looking to be inspired.</i>

31:21.379 --> 31:24.257
And so I went back to my pastry arsenal,
I dug deep.

31:24.340 --> 31:28.720
"What's an elegant, easy dessert
to prepare? Panna cotta."

31:29.554 --> 31:32.557
It's flavored milk.
You set it with gelatin.

31:32.640 --> 31:34.642
It's luxurious.
It's elegant if done right.

31:34.726 --> 31:35.894
I can get down with that.

31:37.312 --> 31:42.066
<i>The only thing about panna cotta</i>
<i>is panna cotta is usually pretty boring.</i>

31:42.483 --> 31:44.694
<i>Maybe it's vanilla panna cotta,</i>
<i>maybe it's chocolate.</i>

31:44.777 --> 31:47.196
<i>If it's really elegant, it's lemon.</i>

31:47.280 --> 31:51.159
That was the breadth of flavors
of panna cotta.

31:51.242 --> 31:56.414
But now I'm landed on this one place
to create, which is flavored milk.

31:57.874 --> 32:01.878
<i>And I walk to the cereal aisle.</i>

32:02.921 --> 32:06.049
<i>It's the aisle I know very well</i>
<i>from my childhood.</i>

32:08.217 --> 32:12.430
I think to myself, "There is such a thing
as cereal-flavored milk."

32:12.513 --> 32:15.850
That's like the best part of when
you're done eating all your cereal,

32:15.934 --> 32:19.562
is like the bottom's-up moment
of drinking this flavored milk.

32:20.104 --> 32:24.025
<i>It feels like a dessert that I would make</i>
<i>if I were a teenager.</i>

32:24.108 --> 32:27.946
<i>But I'm in that weird in-between place</i>
<i>of like, I know I'm not a kid.</i>

32:28.279 --> 32:30.782
I want to be taken seriously
through my dessert.

32:31.574 --> 32:34.827
<i>I don't know what I think,</i>
<i>but I grab a box of cornflakes</i>

32:34.911 --> 32:38.081
and I go back to the kitchen
and I start making panna cottas.

32:44.629 --> 32:46.923
<i>I wait for the cornflakes</i>
<i>to steep 20 minutes...</i>

32:51.135 --> 32:54.180
<i>and I wring as much of the milk out</i>
<i>as I can.</i>

32:59.686 --> 33:02.981
I taste a little, and I'm like,
"Okay, this is interesting.

33:03.064 --> 33:04.190
Maybe this is something."

33:04.774 --> 33:06.609
<i>I bring one to Dave.</i>

33:06.693 --> 33:09.988
<i>I don't say anything because I'm worried</i>
<i>if I tell them it's cereal milk,</i>

33:10.071 --> 33:13.116
<i>they're gonna think</i>
<i>it's too cutesy or too lame,</i>

33:13.199 --> 33:15.410
and I don't know
how they're gonna receive it.

33:15.493 --> 33:18.204
And I walk away,
and I go back into the kitchen.

33:18.287 --> 33:22.291
Dave comes running at me

33:22.375 --> 33:28.339
with his eyes wide open and is like,
"What is this?"

33:28.423 --> 33:29.924
<i>And I said, "Well, it's cereal milk."</i>

33:30.008 --> 33:33.219
And he just, "This is it. This is it."

33:34.887 --> 33:36.597
[David]<i> I was like, "Oh, my God!"</i>

33:36.681 --> 33:40.268
When you eat it,
you're immediately at your childhood.

33:40.351 --> 33:44.063
And that was when I tasted something,
I was like, "This is a world-class dish."

33:46.649 --> 33:49.402
<i>And I remember, like,</i>
<i>"Christina, we need to put</i>

33:49.485 --> 33:52.405
whatever the fuck cereal milk is
in everything.

33:52.864 --> 33:53.781
It's that amazing.

33:53.865 --> 33:55.533
I don't know what the fuck you did,

33:56.034 --> 33:58.995
but we need to put it
in everything possible."

34:18.556 --> 34:22.477
Good morning.
How's it going, lovely woman?

34:22.560 --> 34:24.687
-Can I help you with anything?
-[woman] Yes.

34:25.396 --> 34:27.690
[man] It'll be $5.44 for the two coffees.

34:29.317 --> 34:32.403
-Thank you so much.
-Hey, what are you getting today?

34:36.282 --> 34:37.366
[Christina] <i>Dave was like,</i>

34:37.450 --> 34:40.787
"Yo, you need to take this flavor,
and you need to run with it

34:40.870 --> 34:45.666
as far and as quickly as possible,
and people are gonna be chasing you down.

34:47.543 --> 34:51.089
<i>All of the big ice cream brands are gonna</i>
<i>start making cereal milk ice cream,</i>

34:51.172 --> 34:54.675
<i>and they're all gonna try</i>
<i>and bite off your idea,</i>

34:54.759 --> 34:57.762
and you need to figure out
where you wanna be in that space."

34:57.845 --> 34:59.263
[Christina] Going out front.

34:59.889 --> 35:03.768
<i>We were getting a new landlord in</i>
<i>one of our buildings in the East Village,</i>

35:03.935 --> 35:06.562
<i>and we have to take this space</i>

35:06.646 --> 35:08.731
<i>or somebody else is gonna</i>
<i>move in next to Ssäm Bar</i>

35:08.815 --> 35:10.775
<i>and it can be a whole thing for us.</i>

35:10.858 --> 35:12.944
And Dave was like,
"Why don't you take it?"

35:15.696 --> 35:17.490
A small empty cup? You got it.

35:17.573 --> 35:18.491
[woman] Hi.

35:20.034 --> 35:21.410
[David] <i>You bet on the person.</i>

35:21.828 --> 35:23.704
-Have a good one.
-[woman] What can I get for you?

35:23.788 --> 35:25.706
<i>She expressed that she wanted</i>
<i>to spread her wings,</i>

35:25.790 --> 35:28.126
and Tosi needed to get out of the house.

35:29.418 --> 35:32.797
<i>My job is just to give her the freedom</i>
<i>to do what she needs to do.</i>

35:33.673 --> 35:37.510
Dave helped give me permission to be like,

35:37.593 --> 35:38.928
"I don't owe anyone anything,

35:39.011 --> 35:41.514
and I don't actually need
anyone's permission." [chuckles]

35:43.516 --> 35:47.937
A little bit like,
"F the world, it's mine for the taking"

35:48.020 --> 35:49.730
<i>approach to life.</i>

35:50.481 --> 35:54.694
As opposed to all of the other times
in our friendship,

35:54.777 --> 35:56.904
it only took him joking about it once
for me to be like,

35:56.988 --> 35:59.657
"Great, let's do it. Let's do it."

36:14.297 --> 36:17.842
Three weeks before we're
supposed to open the doors to Milk Bar.

36:19.969 --> 36:22.972
<i>I'm baking, making desserts</i>
<i>for the restaurants,</i>

36:23.055 --> 36:24.807
<i>and then in the middle of the night,</i>

36:24.891 --> 36:29.520
<i>trying to scrape paint off a brick wall,</i>
<i>trying to strip a column.</i>

36:31.731 --> 36:34.442
She was scared. We were all scared.

36:34.525 --> 36:39.280
But I think this was the next level
of me forcing Christina off the ledge.

36:41.407 --> 36:43.201
In true form, I needed help.

36:45.119 --> 36:49.957
<i>I mean, I had people</i>
<i>that I hadn't worked with in years </i>

36:50.041 --> 36:53.252
<i>come by at 2:00 a.m. to help sand benches.</i>

36:54.086 --> 36:57.673
<i>It was like this beautifully imperfect</i>
<i>New York family.</i>

37:00.593 --> 37:05.723
<i>For some reason,</i>
<i>what I was doing attracted these people.</i>

37:06.224 --> 37:11.270
I was like, "Holy shit!
All those people came out to help me."

37:12.730 --> 37:15.024
<i>It literally took a village</i>
<i>to get Milk Bar open.</i>

37:22.740 --> 37:25.993
<i>November 15th, 2008. Opening day.</i>

37:26.702 --> 37:29.247
We opened the doors, 8:00 a.m. Boom.

37:30.539 --> 37:32.583
<i>There was a line out the door,</i>

37:32.667 --> 37:35.253
<i>around the corner of Second Avenue.</i>
<i>Just like that.</i>

37:36.796 --> 37:38.756
<i>And we were in it.</i>

37:41.926 --> 37:47.890
It was this tiny slip of a bakery,
like the size of this bar. It really was.

37:47.974 --> 37:49.433
And there was four or five of us

37:49.517 --> 37:52.645
all scrunched in there,
working and baking all day.

37:52.728 --> 37:57.108
<i>A bunch of young kids just like,</i>
<i>"Hey, we're gonna do this bakery,</i>

37:57.191 --> 38:00.820
<i>and Christina's our fearless leader,</i>
<i>and she knows what she's doing,"</i>

38:00.903 --> 38:03.531
even though she was half a step
ahead of us the whole time.

38:05.533 --> 38:07.576
[Christina]
<i>I finally had something that was mine,</i>

38:07.660 --> 38:08.995
<i>that I had figured out,</i>

38:09.078 --> 38:14.458
<i>and the only thing I needed to do</i>
<i>was create awesome food.</i>

38:17.837 --> 38:21.299
[Courtney]<i> It all happened so quickly,</i>
<i>and we were so crazy busy.</i>

38:21.382 --> 38:24.677
<i>Like, we were exploding out the seams.</i>

38:24.760 --> 38:26.887
Then all of a sudden,
I'd be out and people are like,

38:26.971 --> 38:29.265
"What do you do?"
I was like, "Oh, I work at Milk Bar."

38:29.348 --> 38:31.309
They'd be like, "Oh, my God!"

38:34.145 --> 38:35.771
[Christina]
<i>We thought we were already busy,</i>

38:35.855 --> 38:39.233
and then we got this press
and it was an explosion.

38:39.317 --> 38:41.610
There is this bakery in New York
that I just discovered

38:41.694 --> 38:43.612
that has changed the way--

38:43.696 --> 38:45.364
I didn't know cookies could taste so good.

38:45.448 --> 38:47.074
You told me the name of it.

38:47.158 --> 38:49.702
Anderson Cooper blew Milk Bar up.

38:49.785 --> 38:52.788
I think it's called Milk.
It's next to a restaurant called Momofuku.

38:52.872 --> 38:55.833
He talks about it
for three minutes straight

38:55.916 --> 38:59.086
in a way that, you're like,
you could not have dreamed this.

38:59.170 --> 39:01.589
You couldn't have paid for it.
You could just...

39:01.672 --> 39:04.467
-They have a pie. It's called crack pie...
-You told me about the pie.

39:04.550 --> 39:07.845
...that is literally crack.
There is crack in that pie,

39:07.928 --> 39:09.805
<i>because once you have that pie,</i>

39:09.889 --> 39:12.850
<i>you can think of nothing else</i>
<i>but having more of that pie.</i>

39:12.933 --> 39:17.104
It could not have come
at a more beautiful, challenging time.

39:17.188 --> 39:21.025
To be like, oh, so now, not only does
everyone in New York City

39:21.108 --> 39:23.110
want to know what crack pie is,

39:23.194 --> 39:26.238
<i>now everyone across America</i>

39:26.322 --> 39:30.159
<i>is obsessed with getting their hands</i>
<i>on this crack pie.</i>

39:30.242 --> 39:32.828
<i>And I was just living in that moment.</i>

39:38.751 --> 39:43.422
<i>It wasn't until people that worked</i>
<i>with my mom would say, like,</i>

39:44.215 --> 39:47.051
<i>"I saw your daughter</i>
<i>on Martha Stewart," or,</i>

39:47.134 --> 39:51.597
"Look at this article of your kid
in a magazine doing something,"

39:51.680 --> 39:56.560
that she actually realized
that maybe she could breathe a little bit.

39:58.938 --> 40:02.483
<i>God bless my parents.</i>
<i>They were sure running a number on me.</i>

40:02.566 --> 40:05.861
But I do think that it set me up
for success in life.

40:06.987 --> 40:11.909
<i>And I have notes from them saying,</i>
<i>like, "You've been through it all.</i>

40:11.992 --> 40:14.662
<i>You've had such a hard time,</i>
<i>and I'm so proud of you."</i>

40:16.205 --> 40:19.834
I was her brother.
I still consider myself her older brother.

40:19.917 --> 40:22.294
But even older brothers
with little sisters,

40:22.378 --> 40:25.589
the sister gets to a point, like,
"I'm not gonna listen to brother anymore."

40:26.215 --> 40:29.427
<i>But I'm okay if the sister</i>
<i>outshines the brother.</i>

40:30.845 --> 40:32.430
<i>Totally okay with that.</i>

40:34.473 --> 40:36.434
She's her own boss now.

40:54.535 --> 40:57.163
[Christina] <i>The spirit of Milk Bar is,</i>

40:57.246 --> 41:01.459
<i>"Come in. You're welcome.</i>
<i>We're here for you." </i>

41:01.542 --> 41:03.961
<i>It's not this elitist place.</i>

41:06.297 --> 41:07.590
And that’s important to me.

41:07.673 --> 41:10.134
It's not about, like,
only if you can get a reservation,

41:10.217 --> 41:12.052
and only if you have
a certain amount of money

41:12.136 --> 41:13.387
or a certain amount of time.

41:15.973 --> 41:21.103
<i>You don't need to go to a fine dining,</i>
<i>multi-course menu to indulge.</i>

41:52.760 --> 41:56.805
<i>I think there is something about my path</i>
<i>that is very American Dreamy,</i>

41:56.889 --> 42:00.351
<i>and it's representative of the opportunity</i>

42:00.434 --> 42:05.147
<i>that you see, that you take,</i>
<i>that you carve out for yourself.</i>

42:08.901 --> 42:10.736
<i>And what you go out and get.</i>

42:13.322 --> 42:16.450
<i>You're allowed to be anything</i>
<i>that you wanna be,</i>

42:16.534 --> 42:19.578
<i>and no one gets to tell you differently.</i>

42:25.876 --> 42:30.256
<i>I'm a pastry chef</i>
<i>that can do basically anything.</i>

42:31.423 --> 42:35.553
<i>But I choose to do something</i>
<i>that is more down-to-earth.</i>

42:44.478 --> 42:48.107
<i>It's not something that I went out to do</i>
<i>to send a message.</i>

42:50.150 --> 42:52.486
<i>But it's something that,</i>
<i>when I stop to think about,</i>

42:52.570 --> 42:53.779
<i>I'm really proud of.</i>

43:18.012 --> 43:22.516
<i>The food that I think of and bake</i>
<i>and feed people with...</i>

43:25.436 --> 43:29.189
<i>has a sense of comfort and joy and care.</i>

43:34.069 --> 43:36.405
<i>And it's through the style</i>
<i>of these baked goods</i>

43:36.488 --> 43:42.411
<i>that have existed in America</i>
<i>for generations and generations before me,</i>

43:43.662 --> 43:47.333
and I'm confident for generations
and generations to come.

43:51.712 --> 43:55.007
<i>And that, when kids think</i>
<i>about making a cake,</i>

43:55.633 --> 43:58.719
a lot of them are thinking
about not frosting the sides of it.

43:59.386 --> 44:04.391
<i>And they're thinking about using</i>
<i>their imagination with limitless bounds.</i>

44:05.142 --> 44:08.020
<i>And to think that that started with me,</i>

44:08.103 --> 44:11.523
<i>and that I get to be a part of that</i>
<i>for every generation that comes,</i>

44:11.607 --> 44:14.985
and I have the opportunity to honor
all of the generations before me,

44:15.069 --> 44:17.988
and to take it and run with it...

44:19.281 --> 44:22.451
It just leaves me speechless.
It's pretty cool.
