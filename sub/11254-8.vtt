harassed by creditors.

08:07.069 --> 08:08.321
{\an1}- Oh.

08:08.404 --> 08:09.989

the man leased a castle?

08:10.072 --> 08:11.782

{\an1}- Yes. Let the free market
do the work.

08:36.057 --> 08:39.434
Stop sucking off
the city's teat.

08:39.519 --> 08:41.062
- So if it were up to you,
we would have

08:41.145 --> 08:43.231
a city full of dumb kids
with nowhere to play

08:43.313 --> 08:46.442
but burned-down houses.

08:46.525 --> 08:48.027
- I'm sorry, Connie,
but as I sit here

08:48.110 --> 08:49.946
and I watch Pastor Ballentine
attack the good doctor

08:50.029 --> 08:51.530
like this,
I can't help but think

08:51.614 --> 08:53.991
how these campaigns
have a way of turning ugly.

08:54.075 --> 08:56.118
I mean, don't the people
deserve to hear

08:56.202 --> 08:59.997
{\an3}these issues debated
in a calm and civilized manner?

09:00.081 --> 09:02.667
{\an3}I mean, this--this should be
a--a conversation,

09:02.750 --> 09:04.293
not a cage match.

09:04.377 --> 09:05.670
- Hold--hold on, Ron.

09:05.753 --> 09:08.047
I said those exact words
to you earlier.

09:08.130 --> 09:10.049
- Now, if Boyce is referring
to approaching me

09:10.132 --> 09:12.093
before the debate,
it's true; he did.

09:12.176 --> 09:13.636
- Thank you, Ron.

09:13.719 --> 09:15.763
{\an3}- And I firmly told him
that Ron Saxby

09:15.846 --> 09:19.642
does not engage in those
shady backroom dealings.

09:19.725 --> 09:20.977
- Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:21.060 --> 09:22.353
That's not what happened.

09:22.436 --> 09:24.814
{\an3}- So you didn't
approach him backstage?

09:24.897 --> 09:26.524
{\an1}- No, no, I approached him,
you know?

09:26.607 --> 09:29.193
{\an1}But what I was--what I had--
I had started to, uh--

09:29.277 --> 09:32.071
{\an3}- A lot of hedging
for a man of the cloth.

09:32.154 --> 09:34.740
- Shame, shame, shame.

09:34.824 --> 09:36.826
- You know,
you and this crazy dentist

09:36.909 --> 09:38.494
are twisting my words, man.

09:38.577 --> 09:40.079
- I was hoping we could
keep this friendly.

09:40.162 --> 09:41.664
{\an1}- No, no, no,
I'm the one who wanted

09:41.747 --> 09:43.958
{\an1}to keep it friendly;
I'm the nice one.

09:44.041 --> 09:45.584
- We'll be back
after a short break.

09:45.668 --> 09:46.544
{\an1}- I mean,
come on.

09:46.627 --> 09:47.670
<i>[dramatic fanfare]</i>

09:47.753 --> 09:49.171
[inaudible]

09:49.255 --> 09:51.340
It's some bull[bleep],
is what it is.

09:51.424 --> 09:54.176
- We are still on the air.
- Oh.

10:00.766 --> 10:02.351
{\an3}- Okay, guys.
We're back on in two minutes.

10:02.435 --> 10:04.729
{\an3}- Keesha, I need powder.
I'm feeling shiny.

10:06.439 --> 10:07.356
{\an3}- [groans]

10:07.440 --> 10:10.026
{\an3}- Boyce, can I ask you
something?

10:10.109 --> 10:12.236
Is this a setup?
- What?

10:12.320 --> 10:15.531
{\an3}- Is your whole campaign
a long con to ruin my career?

10:15.615 --> 10:18.701
{\an3}Because I've never seen anybody
debate like that on purpose.

10:18.784 --> 10:22.246
{\an1}- Why couldn't you just say,
"Chin up! Attaboy!

10:22.330 --> 10:23.873
Go get 'em, tiger!"

10:23.956 --> 10:28.002
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Baby, you are killin' it!

10:29.253 --> 10:33.382
- Were you even watching?
- Mm-hmm.

10:33.466 --> 10:36.135
- Lolli, will you please talk
some sense into your husband?

10:36.218 --> 10:39.347
{\an3}I've got some grade-A dirt
on Saxby, but he won't use it.

10:39.430 --> 10:42.558
- I agree with Boyce.
You can't do that to the Saxbys.

10:42.641 --> 10:44.060
Linda's my friend.

10:44.143 --> 10:46.062
{\an3}- You've known that woman
for 20 minutes.

10:46.145 --> 10:48.272
- And some people
you like instantly.

10:48.356 --> 10:52.068
Others, you know for months--
and nothing.

10:52.151 --> 10:53.944
{\an1}- Okay.

10:54.028 --> 10:56.530
{\an3}- Boyce, I respect
your integrity,

10:56.614 --> 10:58.407
as irritating as it is,

10:58.491 --> 11:00.242
{\an3}but you are
getting creamed out there.

11:00.326 --> 11:03.037
{\an3}Why won't you at least
listen to what I've got?

11:03.120 --> 11:06.791
{\an1}- Fine. What is it?
Come on.

11:10.211 --> 11:12.880
{\an1}- All right.
I know for a fact

11:12.963 --> 11:14.173
{\an1}that the mayor
of St. Louis

11:14.256 --> 11:15.257
is into something

11:15.341 --> 11:17.635
called "pony play."

11:17.718 --> 11:21.180
- What? He--he plays
with ponies? What--

11:21.263 --> 11:25.142
{\an1}- No, no, no.
He <i> is</i> the pony.

11:25.226 --> 11:28.771
{\an1}And he likes to have women
ride him around.

11:28.854 --> 11:30.606
Naked.
- Oh.

11:30.689 --> 11:33.609
Come on, that sounds like
one of those crazy rumors.

11:33.692 --> 11:35.277
I don't--
- Oh, really?

11:35.361 --> 11:38.572
Is this a rumor?
- Oh. Oh, wow.

11:38.656 --> 11:43.244
{\an3}Whoa, he--I mean, he got
the hooves on and everything.

11:43.327 --> 11:46.247
{\an3}So how does he
keep the tail on?

11:46.330 --> 11:49.583
{\an3}Oh! Oh, oh!
No, no, no, no.

11:49.667 --> 11:51.335
You know what?

11:51.419 --> 11:53.129
{\an3}That's the freakiest thing
I've ever seen,

11:53.212 --> 11:56.715
{\an3}and I shared a tour bus
with R. Kelly, so...

11:56.799 --> 11:58.467
{\an1}<i>- Back on the air in one,</i>
<i>my friends.</i>

11:58.551 --> 12:00.469
- Okay.
- So you're gonna use it, right?

12:00.553 --> 12:02.888
{\an1}- No, it--it's just
too vicious right there.

12:02.972 --> 12:05.391
{\an1}If I use that against Saxby,
then I'm no better

12:05.474 --> 12:07.017
{\an1}than the politicians
I hate, so...

12:07.101 --> 12:09.145
{\an3}- You're just gonna
go out there and roll over.

12:09.228 --> 12:11.313
{\an1}- No, I can
win this thing, still,

12:11.397 --> 12:12.356
on my own terms.

12:12.440 --> 12:13.941
{\an1}I'm just gonna go out there
and fight.

12:14.024 --> 12:15.776
{\an1}You got to remember,
I come from the streets.

12:15.860 --> 12:17.069
- You come from Frontenac.

12:17.153 --> 12:18.487
{\an3}That's a very nice
neighborhood.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.990
- Well, they got streets.

12:21.073 --> 12:22.575
{\an1}You know,
stuff went down out there.

12:22.658 --> 12:24.702
I mean, people's bikes
got stolen, you know?

12:24.785 --> 12:29.206
{\an1}Sometimes kids
couldn't find their book bags.

12:29.290 --> 12:31.459
I admit, Saxby caught me
off guard in round one,

12:31.542 --> 12:33.919
{\an1}but in round two,
I'm coming out swinging.

12:34.003 --> 12:34.920
- Hey, Boyce.

12:35.004 --> 12:36.088
{\an3}Stormy,
this is my son Boyce

12:36.172 --> 12:37.965
I was telling you about.

12:38.048 --> 12:39.508
He's the one
that laughed at me

12:39.592 --> 12:41.677
for wearing a parka
to Summerfest '98.

12:41.760 --> 12:45.681
{\an3}- Ah, yes, a late-season
cold front came barreling in

12:45.764 --> 12:46.682
from Lake Superior.

12:46.765 --> 12:49.393
- This boy
was wearing flip-flops.

12:49.477 --> 12:51.312
[laughter]

12:51.395 --> 12:53.439
{\an1}- You know, it's great to go
down memory lane, guys,

12:53.522 --> 12:55.065
{\an1}but, Dad, I got to
get back to the debate.

12:55.149 --> 12:56.275
- You're doing great
out there, son.

12:56.358 --> 12:58.444
You're crushing Saxby.

12:58.527 --> 13:02.239
{\an1}- Is nobody in my family
watching this thing?

13:02.323 --> 13:04.158
<i>[dramatic fanfare]</i>

13:04.241 --> 13:06.702
- Welcome back
to KTAZ's Mayoral Debate.

13:06.785 --> 13:08.204
Mayor Saxby, moving on

13:08.287 --> 13:10.414
{\an3}to the topic of pension reform,
how would you--

13:10.498 --> 13:12.917
{\an1}- Sorry to interrupt you,
Connie, but I'd like to clarify

13:13.000 --> 13:15.085
{\an1}a few things
from last round,

13:15.169 --> 13:17.838
{\an1}as long as my good friend Ron
here doesn't mind.

13:17.922 --> 13:19.465
- Well, actually, Boyce,
I don't think it's--

13:19.548 --> 13:21.425
{\an1}- Good.

13:21.509 --> 13:25.054
Now, you all saw me lose
my temper, and you know what?

13:25.137 --> 13:28.390
I'm glad you did,
because if I have to get mad

13:28.474 --> 13:30.726
to let the people of St. Louis
know that Saxby

13:30.809 --> 13:32.937
is ripping them off,
that he is balancing his budget

13:33.020 --> 13:36.899
on their backs,
then damn right I'll get mad,

13:36.982 --> 13:40.194
and I'll make mad matter.

13:41.487 --> 13:43.030
- Mayor Saxby, care to respond?
- Yes, I would.

13:43.113 --> 13:45.908
I find it interesting
that Pastor Ballentine brings up

13:45.991 --> 13:48.911
the city's budget,
when there were years

13:48.994 --> 13:50.788
the man couldn't even
balance his own.

13:50.871 --> 13:52.831
- Uh, say what, now?

13:52.915 --> 13:53.999
- The truth is,
even as Boyce Ballentine

13:54.083 --> 13:56.669
raked it in
as a show business celebrity,

13:56.752 --> 13:59.380
his extravagant
and irresponsible lifestyle

13:59.463 --> 14:03.384
kept him from paying the rent
on his castle.

14:03.467 --> 14:07.096
{\an3}- You told him?
I-I thought we were friends.

14:07.179 --> 14:08.097
{\an1}- Well, of course
we're friends.

14:08.180 --> 14:09.682
This stuff's just politics.

14:09.765 --> 14:11.892
{\an1}Come on, Lolli.
Don't be mad.

14:11.976 --> 14:13.852
- How can I not
be mad, Linda?

14:13.936 --> 14:15.354
You stabbed me in the back.

14:15.437 --> 14:16.939
{\an1}- No, no, no, no, no,
my husband

14:17.022 --> 14:19.316
{\an1}stabbed your husband
in the back.

14:19.400 --> 14:21.527
{\an3}- 'Cause you gave him
the knife!

14:21.610 --> 14:24.363
{\an1}- I'm sorry.
I forgot you're new at this.

14:24.446 --> 14:26.699
{\an1}I hope we're still on
for "Scandal" Thursday.

14:26.782 --> 14:28.576
{\an3}- Don't make me
take off my earrings.

14:28.659 --> 14:29.868
- Okay. Oh.

14:29.952 --> 14:31.120
- So I ask you,

14:31.203 --> 14:32.621
can we afford
to have this man

14:32.705 --> 14:35.124
in charge of
our city's checkbook?

14:35.207 --> 14:37.042
- Pastor, is all this true?

14:37.126 --> 14:41.297
- We'll be right back.
Right, Connie?

14:41.380 --> 14:43.007
We'll be right back.

14:43.090 --> 14:44.508
Please say it.

14:47.469 --> 14:49.263
- Where the hell did Saxby
get that info?

14:49.346 --> 14:51.098
{\an3}The only people that knew about
that time in my life

14:51.181 --> 14:53.142
{\an3}were me, Lolli,
and my old accountant,

14:53.225 --> 14:55.060
Dennis Chen.
- Do you trust him?

14:55.144 --> 14:58.772
{\an3}- No, he's the one who told us
we could afford the castle.

14:58.856 --> 15:00.816
- Baby, we need to talk.
- Look, babe, can it wait?

15:00.899 --> 15:02.776
I mean, we're
in crisis mode right now.

15:02.860 --> 15:04.945
{\an1}I believe Saxby
has an inside man.

15:05.029 --> 15:07.489
- Or woman.
- Okay, sure, it's 2016.

15:07.573 --> 15:09.241
Yes, I get it.

15:09.325 --> 15:11.493
The point is, it's like
he has a spy, you know--

15:11.577 --> 15:14.580
{\an3}- A spy
who loves you very much

15:14.663 --> 15:17.875
{\an3}and thought she was friends
with that snitch Linda.

15:17.958 --> 15:21.003
{\an1}- You mean
your bestie Linda?

15:21.086 --> 15:22.963
- So you told her?
Why?

15:23.047 --> 15:24.882
- Babe, we were chatting.

15:24.965 --> 15:28.677
I mean, that's what ladies do
when you're locked in a room

15:28.761 --> 15:33.307
with sushi, wine,
and nothing on TV.

15:33.390 --> 15:35.851
- I'm debating on TV.

15:35.934 --> 15:37.686
{\an1}- Boyce, I hope
this opens your eyes

15:37.770 --> 15:39.855
{\an1}to the type of people
we're up against.

15:39.938 --> 15:42.066
- You know what?
The man tells lies about me.

15:42.149 --> 15:44.735
He steals my ideas.
He manipulates my wife.

15:44.818 --> 15:45.986
It's going down.

15:46.070 --> 15:47.821
{\an3}- Yes.
Baby, whatever dirt

15:47.905 --> 15:50.282
{\an3}you have on Saxby,
you use it.

15:50.366 --> 15:51.533
- What are you
talking about?

15:51.617 --> 15:53.535
- I finally woke up, Dad.

15:53.619 --> 15:55.537
{\an1}Everything that I want
to accomplish

15:55.621 --> 15:57.873
means nothing
if I don't win this election.

15:57.956 --> 16:01.251
So I'm about to go in there
and take that man down

16:01.335 --> 16:02.836
in his own filth.

16:02.920 --> 16:06.048
{\an1}- I am so proud
of you right now.

16:06.131 --> 16:08.842
{\an1}This is what it must feel like
to be a mother.

16:08.926 --> 16:10.344
{\an1}- I sure hope you know
what you're doing,

16:10.427 --> 16:11.887
{\an1}going out there,
slinging mud.

16:11.970 --> 16:17.059
{\an3}- Mud kills more people
every year than hurricanes.

16:17.142 --> 16:18.686
- And he would know.

16:18.769 --> 16:21.397
{\an3}- Dad, I can't let Saxby
just walk all over me.

16:21.480 --> 16:26.527
{\an3}- Boyce, you've got to think
about your reputation.

16:26.610 --> 16:28.570
- Why am I getting
political advice

16:28.654 --> 16:30.447
from Stormy Hernandez?

16:30.531 --> 16:33.200
{\an1}- Son, go ahead
and do what you got to do.

16:33.283 --> 16:35.411
{\an1}All I'm saying is,
anytime you sling mud,

16:35.494 --> 16:37.913
{\an1}you end up
getting some on yourself.

16:37.996 --> 16:39.540
{\an3}- But what choice
do I have?

16:39.623 --> 16:40.874
<i>- All right, friends,</i>
<i>places.</i>

16:40.958 --> 16:42.459
<i>We're back live</i>
<i>in one minute.</i>

16:47.089 --> 16:48.590
{\an1}- You ready for
another round, Pastor?

16:48.674 --> 16:50.843
- [sighs]
- That Saxby plays dirty, huh?

16:50.926 --> 16:53.095
{\an3}- Believe me, you don't know
the half of it.

16:53.178 --> 16:54.430
- What are you
talking about?

16:54.513 --> 16:56.140
{\an3}- [sighs]

16:59.268 --> 17:00.561
{\an3}- I'd like to focus
this round

17:00.644 --> 17:02.271
{\an3}on the city's
budget shortfall.

17:02.354 --> 17:05.816
Dr. Zagelman, you fancy
yourself a fiscal wonk.

17:05.898 --> 17:08.444
- Correct, and after studying
the great monetary theorists,

17:08.527 --> 17:09.653
I have to conclude...

17:09.737 --> 17:11.946
{\an1}Mayor Saxby
is a freaking sex pervert!

17:12.030 --> 17:13.115
- Whoa!
- What?

17:13.198 --> 17:14.450
- Please.
- I know for a fact

17:14.532 --> 17:15.784
{\an1}that he dresses up
like a pony

17:15.867 --> 17:17.618
{\an1}and has women
ride him around.

17:17.703 --> 17:20.664
{\an3}- That is an outrageous
accusation.

17:20.748 --> 17:22.540
- So you deny it?

17:22.624 --> 17:24.667
{\an1}- I'm not even gonna
dignify it with a response.

17:24.752 --> 17:26.086
- That's not a denial.

17:26.170 --> 17:27.963
- Okay, now, now, now.
Look, guys.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.757
Things are getting
pretty unseemly.

17:29.840 --> 17:32.259
I think the voters would like us
to get back to the issues.

17:32.342 --> 17:33.635
- Yes.
- They're not interested

17:33.719 --> 17:36.555
in whether or not
a man likes to saddle up

17:36.638 --> 17:40.476
and have a lady
trot him around the yard.

17:40.559 --> 17:42.936
- Which I never admitted to.

17:43.020 --> 17:44.313
- Or denied.

17:44.396 --> 17:46.148
- There's no reason
for me to deny something

17:46.231 --> 17:47.441
so patently ridiculous.

17:47.524 --> 17:49.777
- Still not a denial.

17:49.860 --> 17:53.030
{\an3}- This is way better
than "Scandal."

17:53.113 --> 17:54.323
<i>- Okay, gentlemen.</i>

17:54.406 --> 17:55.574
{\an3}Let's get
back on track here.

17:55.657 --> 17:57.284
- Please.
- Yes, you know what?

17:57.367 --> 17:59.536
The candidates' personal lives
should be off-limits.

17:59.620 --> 18:01.663
And even if
these sordid allegations

18:01.747 --> 18:04.249
were true,
my reaction as a pastor

18:04.333 --> 18:06.168
would be to offer him
counseling

18:06.251 --> 18:08.253
or perhaps a sugar cube.

18:08.337 --> 18:09.838
[laughs]

18:09.922 --> 18:11.006
- The real question is,

18:11.089 --> 18:13.175
{\an1}do we want this man
to represent our city?

18:13.258 --> 18:15.219
And I say, "Neigh!"

18:15.302 --> 18:16.678
- You son of a bitch!
- Oh, yeah!

18:16.762 --> 18:18.263
- Hey, okay, gentlemen.
- You have no right--

18:18.347 --> 18:19.765
- Come on, boy--
- Gentlemen!

18:19.848 --> 18:21.308
[all shouting]

18:22.100 --> 18:24.019
- Well played, Ballentine.

18:24.102 --> 18:25.521
- Excuse me?
- I know it was you.

18:25.604 --> 18:27.356
{\an1}- I don't know
what you're talking about.

18:27.439 --> 18:29.441
- Please, Zagelman's
not capable of this.

18:29.525 --> 18:30.901
{\an3}Look at him.
He's unhinged.

18:30.984 --> 18:34.029
{\an3}- I, uh, like
my government small,

18:34.112 --> 18:36.323
like my women.

18:36.406 --> 18:38.283
{\an1}- The Twittersphere
is going crazy.

18:38.367 --> 18:40.661
{\an1}Our "Boyce the Choice"
hashtag is trending.

18:40.744 --> 18:45.207
{\an3}- I don't understand
a single word you just said.

18:45.290 --> 18:48.460
- Boyce did good.
- Say that next time.

18:48.544 --> 18:50.254
{\an1}- Okay, look, we both
got our licks in,

18:50.337 --> 18:52.172
{\an1}so let's agree to keep it
above the belt from here on out.

18:52.256 --> 18:54.675
{\an3}- No, no, that's not
the way it works.

18:54.758 --> 18:55.884
{\an3}You're one of us now,
Pastor, okay?

18:55.968 --> 18:58.136
{\an3}The difference is,
I've been here before.

18:58.220 --> 18:59.388
- Yeah, I know.

18:59.471 --> 19:01.348
It's not your first rodeo.
- Oh!

19:01.431 --> 19:03.517
- Okay, okay, that's funny.
I'm gonna destroy you.

19:03.600 --> 19:04.810
- Yeah, well,
bring it, man--

19:04.893 --> 19:06.144
{\an3}- Yeah, you know,
why don't you

19:06.228 --> 19:07.437
{\an3}stay out of
my husband's face?

19:07.521 --> 19:09.273
{\an1}- Why don't you
rein your husband in?

19:09.356 --> 19:09.982
- Oh, that's a good one.
- Oh!

19:10.065 --> 19:11.817
- Shut up, you quack.

19:11.900 --> 19:13.360
{\an1}- Quack?
Who you calling quack? Me?

19:13.443 --> 19:15.904
{\an1}- Don't point your finger
at my husband's face.

19:15.988 --> 19:20.576
[all shouting at once]

19:20.659 --> 19:23.328
