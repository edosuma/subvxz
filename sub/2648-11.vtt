WEBVTT

00:03.295 --> 00:05.786
- Good night, sweet pea.
- Good night, honey.

00:08.425 --> 00:11.841
- Mitchell, there's a stranger in our hot tub.
- Who is it?

00:11.929 --> 00:14.005
You do know what "stranger" means,
don't you?

00:14.097 --> 00:16.968
Oh, my G... Oh, my God!
How long has he been there?

00:17.059 --> 00:20.428
I saw him exactly one second before you.
You know everything I know.

00:20.521 --> 00:23.557
- Okay, I'm calling 911.
- I'm getting my bat.

00:26.235 --> 00:27.693
Maybe we're overreacting.

00:27.778 --> 00:29.984
- He could have a very good reason.
- We should at least say hello.

00:30.072 --> 00:31.981
- It's only polite.
- Okay.

00:33.408 --> 00:35.235
<i># Hey, hey #</i>

00:35.327 --> 00:37.367
<i># Hey, hey #</i>

00:37.454 --> 00:39.447
<i># Hey, hey #</i>

00:39.540 --> 00:41.413
<i># Hey, hey #</i>

00:41.500 --> 00:42.662
<i># Hey ##.</i>

00:44.461 --> 00:47.035
So I looked that coyote dead in the eye...

00:47.130 --> 00:49.704
and I let him know,
without saying a word...

00:49.800 --> 00:52.125
"I will not harm you...

00:52.219 --> 00:54.377
but I'm the alpha here."

00:54.471 --> 00:57.887
And he just stared back at me,
mesmerized.

00:59.685 --> 01:01.143
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

01:01.228 --> 01:02.639
Amazing.

01:02.729 --> 01:05.814
Turns out Barry just moved
into the apartment upstairs...

01:05.899 --> 01:08.141
and thought the hot tub
was for the whole building.

01:08.235 --> 01:10.192
Anyway, he's a super cool guy...

01:10.279 --> 01:12.900
and he's straight,
so there's no weirdness.

01:12.990 --> 01:15.029
Aside from you turning
into a 16-year-old girl.

01:15.117 --> 01:18.201
- I did not.  
- Yeah.

01:18.287 --> 01:20.410
- Cameron, give me your arm.
- Okay.

01:24.877 --> 01:28.080
- What you doing?
- Oh, I'm studying to be a Reiki master.

01:28.172 --> 01:31.422
What I'm doing is I'm transferring
my positive energy into Cameron...

01:31.508 --> 01:34.462
- and I'm taking out all the negative energy.
- Okay.

01:34.553 --> 01:36.095
- Do you feel that?
- I do.

01:36.180 --> 01:39.430
- Does it feel warm?
- It does. It feels warm, Mitchell.

01:39.516 --> 01:42.186
Imagine that, in a hot tub.

01:42.269 --> 01:44.558
What are you gonna do
when he drives by?

01:44.646 --> 01:46.271
I'm gonna tell him to slow down.

01:46.356 --> 01:48.978
I think you should drag him
out of his car...

01:49.067 --> 01:52.068
and we all get turns punching him
in the stomach until he barfs.

01:52.154 --> 01:54.823
Honey, I think I'm just gonna
turn over his license plate to the police.

01:54.907 --> 01:56.401
Please.

01:56.491 --> 01:58.531
Order a pizza and call the cops.

01:58.619 --> 02:00.161
We'll see who gets here first.

02:00.245 --> 02:02.915
<i>Ever since they put</i>
<i>those speed bumps on Oakmont...</i>

02:02.998 --> 02:06.165
some lunatic driver in
a crazy sports car...

02:06.251 --> 02:08.788
has been racing down our street,
and it is dangerous.

02:08.878 --> 02:11.037
We've got kids here
and babies in strollers...

02:11.131 --> 02:12.590
and moms who like to jog.

02:12.674 --> 02:14.418
She has to run every day
or she goes crazy.

02:14.510 --> 02:15.968
She's like a border collie.

02:16.053 --> 02:18.045
You're comparing me to a dog?

02:19.139 --> 02:21.132
The smartest dogs in the world.

02:25.103 --> 02:27.939
- What are you guys doing?
- What the cops won't.

02:28.023 --> 02:29.517
We are catching that speeder.

02:29.608 --> 02:31.684
And when we do,
he's gonna get an earful of this.

02:31.777 --> 02:33.105
Slow down, jerk!

02:33.195 --> 02:35.567
- Okay. Easy.
- Oh, my God. Mom, what are you doing?

02:35.656 --> 02:38.360
- Why are you being such a freak?
- I am being a freak for safety.

02:38.450 --> 02:39.779
And I'm doing this for you...

02:39.868 --> 02:41.742
because I don't want
anything bad to happen to you.

02:41.828 --> 02:44.117
Well, it's embarrassing.
Mom, you need a life.

02:44.206 --> 02:48.453
Why can't you just volunteer at the
museum or bring pudding to old people?

02:48.544 --> 02:50.620
Honey, if anybody's being embarrassing
right now, it's you.

02:50.712 --> 02:53.464
 Luke, I am your father.

02:53.549 --> 02:55.625
That takes me back to the delivery room.

02:55.717 --> 02:58.387
That's what I said to you when you were
coming out of your mom's lady parts.

02:58.470 --> 03:00.262
Oh, my God, Dad!

03:00.347 --> 03:01.972
Oh, my God. I know those girls.

03:03.684 --> 03:05.723
- Yes!
 Sweet Valley High!

03:05.811 --> 03:09.014
- This is that woman from the house on Seventh Street.
- Ooh, good.

03:09.106 --> 03:10.897
If I sell it by the end of next month...

03:10.983 --> 03:13.271
I dethrone Gil Thorpe
as salesman of the quarter.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.269
- That's awesome, Dad.
- It <i>is</i> awesome.

03:16.905 --> 03:18.649
- Phil Dunphy. Yeah.
- That's it. That's the speeder.

03:18.740 --> 03:20.532
Slow down, jerk! Slow down!

03:20.617 --> 03:23.488
- Yeah, that's great. Okay, fire away.
- 2-U-R-N-8-0...

03:23.579 --> 03:25.904
- Yeah. What's the address?
- 2-U-R-N-8-0-1.

03:25.998 --> 03:27.326
- Yeah. Okay, 1-0...
- A pen.

03:27.416 --> 03:29.989
- I gave it to Dad.
- Okay, 101 North...

03:30.085 --> 03:32.042
- 2-U-R... Oh, God.
- Seventh Street.

03:32.129 --> 03:33.504
Okay. 10-4.

03:33.589 --> 03:36.922
This is gonna be my best year
since 2006.

03:38.427 --> 03:40.965
Let's go, kid. Back to the salt mine.

03:41.054 --> 03:43.842
- That's okay, Jay. I'm biking to school today.
- Good for you.

03:43.932 --> 03:47.467
There's a bunch of cool kids who ride their
bikes every day. Thought I'd join them.

03:47.561 --> 03:49.470
Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

03:49.563 --> 03:52.136
- What the hell is that?
- My new bike.

03:52.232 --> 03:54.604
Mom got it for me yesterday.
Pretty sweet, huh?

03:54.693 --> 03:57.896
- It's got training wheels.
- Nice ones. Custom-made.

03:57.988 --> 04:00.064
- They don't usually come on bikes this size.
- Gloria!

04:00.157 --> 04:02.196
- What's wrong?
- You don't know how to ride a bike?

04:02.284 --> 04:06.447
- I know how to ride this bike.
- Stephen Hawking could ride that bike.

04:06.538 --> 04:10.203
- <i>Ay.</i> What happened? Did he fall?
- How could he fall?

04:10.292 --> 04:13.708
You can't send him to school on a bike with
training wheels. They'll make fun of him.

04:13.795 --> 04:15.455
Didn't you teach him how to ride a bike?

04:15.547 --> 04:17.374
How could I?
I don't know how to ride a bike.

04:17.466 --> 04:19.672
Two-thirds of my house
can't do what a billion Chinese do.

04:19.760 --> 04:22.215
My mother thought
that riding a bike was dangerous.

04:22.304 --> 04:24.297
She would say,
"That's how people grab you."

04:24.389 --> 04:27.556
Okay. This is how it's going down.
Today I'm driving you to school.

04:27.643 --> 04:30.560
On the weekend, I'm buying you a bike
and I'm teaching both of you.

04:30.646 --> 04:33.101
I'm nervous, but I'm excited.

04:33.190 --> 04:36.107
You two have fun. I pass.
It makes no sense.

04:36.193 --> 04:38.150
There's no reason
that thing should stay upright.

04:38.237 --> 04:40.692
There's no reason you should
stay upright, but it just works.

04:44.868 --> 04:47.953
- Hey, Phil. Come on in.
- Laura, good day.

04:48.038 --> 04:51.905
Boy, I couldn't love this entry any more.
It's very welcoming.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.491
Yeah, I got a thing in 10 minutes,
so I have to make this quick.

04:54.586 --> 04:58.251
Great. Let me run through my three-pronged
approach to selling this place.

04:58.340 --> 05:00.498
I only need one prong: sell the house.

05:00.592 --> 05:04.424
I don't want to be that yutz who prices her
house too high so it sits around for a year...

05:04.513 --> 05:07.086
while every looky-loo
without something to do on Sundays...

05:07.182 --> 05:08.760
is going through my underwear drawer.

05:08.851 --> 05:11.092
- What's a number?
- There are quite a few factors to take into...

05:11.186 --> 05:12.680
Need a number.

05:12.771 --> 05:16.105
We list at 1.4.
We take anything north of 1.25.

05:16.191 --> 05:17.769
Done!

05:17.860 --> 05:19.235
Great.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.775
- I got all the paperwork right here.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:21.864 --> 05:24.355
You gotta buy me a beer before you
could put your hand up my sweater.

05:24.449 --> 05:26.359
Oh, I had no intention...

05:26.451 --> 05:29.452
Put on a great open house this weekend,
the listing's yours.

05:31.290 --> 05:34.990
Bring it, Laura. You wanna test me?
I've been tested my whole life.

05:35.085 --> 05:37.541
They could never find anything.

05:37.629 --> 05:40.583
So, uh, Sunday, 12:00 to 4:00
for the open house?

05:40.674 --> 05:42.133
- That works for you?
- Great.

05:42.217 --> 05:45.302
Great. And if you have any questions
or you need anything, just call.

05:45.387 --> 05:48.258
- When you work with me, you're working with a friend.
- That is so sweet.

05:48.348 --> 05:51.018
I like you.
God, I hope I don't have to fire you.

05:58.609 --> 06:00.897
- <i>Hi. This is Claire. Leave a message.</i>
- <i> </i>

06:00.986 --> 06:04.651
Hey, honey, it's me. I just finished
the meeting, and she is the perfect client.

06:08.035 --> 06:10.822
She's a real character.
You gotta meet her.

06:16.001 --> 06:18.872
But she's moving soon,
so what's the point?

06:24.927 --> 06:26.884
- Hey!
- Wow. You worked late.

06:26.970 --> 06:29.177
Yes. Brutal day. I just wanna sit.

06:29.264 --> 06:31.934
Perfect. Lily's asleep.
Barry's meeting us in the hot tub.

06:32.017 --> 06:34.508
- If you're feeling stressed, he can give you a treatment.
- Ah, that's all right.

06:34.603 --> 06:37.723
- I have an appointment with Dr. Bigfoot tomorrow.
- Okay, here comes the judge.

06:37.814 --> 06:41.100
  Reiki is a bunch of nonsense, Cam.
That guy's a nut.

06:41.193 --> 06:43.020
You do this every time.
We meet a new friend.

06:43.111 --> 06:45.353
They say one thing you don't like
and you just write 'em off.

06:45.447 --> 06:47.523
- I do not.
- Oh, really? What about "But yet" Rachel?

06:47.616 --> 06:50.451
  "I'd love to go,
but yet I don't feel like parking."

06:50.536 --> 06:52.445
It's either "but" or "yet," not both.

06:52.538 --> 06:54.614
You're lucky no one's kicked your butt yet.
What about Thomas?

06:54.706 --> 06:57.280
You wrote him off because he serves
a salad <i>after</i> the meal...

06:57.376 --> 06:59.534
which, by the way,
is very common in Europe.

06:59.628 --> 07:01.668
What part of Europe is he from?
Pretentioustan?

07:01.755 --> 07:03.878
Okay, fine. Keep judging.
Don't let anyone in.

07:03.966 --> 07:06.124
- I could care less.
- I think you mean you couldn't care less...

07:06.218 --> 07:08.543
because if you could care less,
it means you care a little bit.

07:08.637 --> 07:12.386
I'm going to the hot tub. If I stay here one
more minute, my head is literally gonna explode.

07:12.474 --> 07:13.803
I hope not, because if
you mean literally...

07:13.892 --> 07:15.885
I don't feel safe in my own home!

07:18.856 --> 07:21.062
 Phil, honey, I need your help.
- With what?

07:21.149 --> 07:23.985
What is the one thing
a speeder can't outrun?

07:24.069 --> 07:26.145
Ooh. Bullets. A laser.

07:26.238 --> 07:27.732
Oh, I know. A falcon.

07:27.823 --> 07:29.282
- Dad, jump in.
- Not a good time.

07:29.366 --> 07:30.860
- A laser-falcon.
- That's awesome.

07:32.202 --> 07:33.696
Shame.

07:34.788 --> 07:37.575
"Slow down your neighbors"?

07:37.666 --> 07:41.580
No. "Slow down," talking to the speeder.

07:41.670 --> 07:43.912
Who's talking to the speeder?
"Your neighbors."

07:44.006 --> 07:46.841
- It doesn't say that.
- Yeah, it just says, "Slow down your neighbors."

07:46.925 --> 07:49.001
- Phil.
- I know what you were going for...

07:49.094 --> 07:51.051
but now all I can see is
"Slow down your neighbors."

07:51.138 --> 07:54.423
Well, you're all wrong, 'cause this is incredibly clear.
And it's really important.

07:54.516 --> 07:56.473
We need to put these signs up
all over the neighborhood.

07:56.560 --> 07:58.517
- I don't know. It seems kind of cowardly.
- Mm-mmm.

07:58.604 --> 08:00.680
Why don't you just make
an anonymous call to the police?

08:00.772 --> 08:03.263
I called the police,
and they were totally unhelpful.

08:03.358 --> 08:05.150
Surprise, surprise.

08:05.235 --> 08:07.394
- Phil, come on. You with me or not?
- Of course I'm with you.

08:07.487 --> 08:10.405
Who else would I be with? This guy?
I have no connection to this guy.

08:10.490 --> 08:11.605
- Good.
- No!

08:13.368 --> 08:14.697
Fine.

08:14.786 --> 08:17.622
Before you judge me,
I have come in second to Gil Thorpe...

08:17.706 --> 08:20.707
for salesman of the quarter
seven quarters in a row.

08:20.792 --> 08:22.619
Seven.

08:22.711 --> 08:24.538
Nobody remembers second best.

08:24.630 --> 08:28.497
Oh, yeah, everybody loves Michael Jordan,
but nobody thinks of Scottie Pippen.

08:28.592 --> 08:32.636
The only reason I remember him is because
he's named after my favorite musical.

08:34.640 --> 08:36.134
Oh. Hey, Mitch.

08:36.225 --> 08:38.217
- Hey, it's Barry.
- I just wanna let you guys know...

08:38.309 --> 08:40.136
you got a sprinkler head
that's leaking out there.

08:40.229 --> 08:41.806
Thanks, Barry. I'll let the gardener know.

08:41.897 --> 08:45.681
All right. Or maybe I can just wave
my hands over it and heal it that way.

08:47.194 --> 08:48.474
I'm joking.

08:48.570 --> 08:49.899
Oh.

08:49.988 --> 08:52.823
- Oh, God! That was a good one.
- Look, don't worry about it.

08:52.908 --> 08:54.486
As soon as I started talking about Reiki...

08:54.576 --> 08:56.485
I could tell you thought
I might be a little nutty.

08:56.578 --> 08:58.487
Ah. Was I that obvious?

08:58.580 --> 09:00.739
- You roll your eyes a lot.

09:03.418 --> 09:06.419
I once saw a picture of myself
at a friend's poetry slam...

09:06.505 --> 09:09.422
and all you could see
were the whites of my eyes.

09:09.508 --> 09:11.999
Yeah, I looked like Little Orphan Annie.

09:12.094 --> 09:13.173
The cartoon.

09:13.262 --> 09:15.171
I'm sorry if I offended you.

09:15.264 --> 09:17.422
No, don't apologize. Look, I...

09:17.516 --> 09:20.351
Only thing that offends me
is a man who doesn't live in his own truth.

09:22.187 --> 09:24.678
And I appreciate how hard you're trying
not to roll your eyes right now.

09:24.773 --> 09:26.896
- 'Cause I'm about to pass out.
- I see it.

09:27.943 --> 09:30.268
Okay, I'm ready!

09:33.782 --> 09:35.276
What the hell is he wearing?

09:35.367 --> 09:36.861
Protection pads. He needs more?

09:36.952 --> 09:39.241
We're riding bikes.
We're not training police dogs.

09:39.329 --> 09:40.989
All right, kid, come on. Get on.

09:42.624 --> 09:44.533
On board.

09:44.626 --> 09:46.702
That-a-boy. All right, we ready?

09:46.795 --> 09:48.539
Ride.

09:48.630 --> 09:50.872
- Be careful, <i>papi.</i>
- Ignore her.

09:50.966 --> 09:53.753
I've seen the kid fall down
on that moving sidewalk at the airport...

09:53.844 --> 09:55.552
so I didn't have high hopes.

09:56.346 --> 09:58.304
- Whoa.

09:58.390 --> 10:00.715
<i>But what do you know,</i>
<i>the kid was a natural.</i>

10:00.809 --> 10:02.766
Mom, it's so easy.

10:02.853 --> 10:04.762
- Bravo, Manny!
- I told you.

10:04.855 --> 10:06.847
Be careful with the bump.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.565
Hey, wait a minute. Who's that guy?

10:08.650 --> 10:10.192
Jay, he's gonna grab him!

10:10.277 --> 10:12.649
Ah, no one's grabbing anyone.
It's a neighbor.

10:12.738 --> 10:15.692
Gloria, on the other hand,
was a natural disaster.

10:15.782 --> 10:19.068
There are three things you wanna do
before you ride. Manny.

10:19.161 --> 10:22.364
Check your shoelaces,
adjust your mirror and test your bell.

10:22.456 --> 10:25.576
Okay, shoelaces tied. The mirror is good.

10:28.504 --> 10:30.247
- Okay, now what?
- Ride.

10:30.339 --> 10:32.877
<i>Ay,</i> no, no, no, Jay.
Don't push me. I don't want to get hurt.

10:32.966 --> 10:35.374
Trust me, I'm not gonna hurt you.
You're a work of art.

10:35.469 --> 10:37.260
If you get scratched,
the value goes down.

10:37.346 --> 10:39.718
- I'm making a joke to lighten the mood.
- It's not working.

10:39.806 --> 10:41.265
Let's just do this.

10:41.350 --> 10:43.389
Okay.

10:43.477 --> 10:45.101
Slowly.

10:45.187 --> 10:46.847
Jay, slowly.

10:46.939 --> 10:49.097
Relax. You're not gonna fall. I got ya.

10:49.191 --> 10:51.764
Put your feet on the pedals.
Now look where you're going.

10:51.860 --> 10:53.402
- Look where you're going.
- No, I'm falling.

10:53.487 --> 10:55.147
Look straight ahead. Go, go, go. Pedal!

10:55.239 --> 10:56.733
- No, Jay!

10:56.823 --> 10:58.567
- What are you ringing the bell for?
- <i>¡Ay!</i>

10:58.659 --> 11:00.782
- Why you let me go, Jay?
- No, no! Pedal!

11:00.869 --> 11:04.072
No, look where you're going!
Look where you're going!

11:04.164 --> 11:05.623
I'm gonna kill you, Jay!

11:05.707 --> 11:08.198
Okay. Good day's work.

11:08.293 --> 11:10.535
What do you say we hit the jewelry store?

11:17.135 --> 11:20.089
- Phil?
- Laura.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.722
What are you doing?

11:21.807 --> 11:24.512
Taking this... sign down.

11:24.601 --> 11:26.808
I recognized your license plate.

11:26.895 --> 11:30.264
- This is ridiculous.
- I know. They're all over the neighborhood.

11:30.357 --> 11:33.940
- What kind of lunatic does something like this?
- Who knows?

11:34.027 --> 11:35.771
It's probably some bored housewife...

11:35.863 --> 11:37.939
who hates her husband
and hates her life...

11:38.031 --> 11:39.989
so she takes it out on the rest of us!

11:40.075 --> 11:43.159
Or things are so good at home,
she's out looking for problems.

11:43.245 --> 11:45.997
Trust me. This woman needs to get laid.

11:46.081 --> 11:48.157
I don't think that's the issue.

11:48.250 --> 11:49.993
Here. Stick this up.

11:50.085 --> 11:52.327
Send her a message from me.

11:52.421 --> 11:54.045
Okay.

11:57.259 --> 11:59.002
- Hey!
- Hey!

11:59.094 --> 12:01.929
- Oh, my gosh. What happened to my sign?
- I don't know.

12:02.014 --> 12:05.050
I put it up. I went away. I came back.

12:05.142 --> 12:07.016
It was in pieces.

12:07.102 --> 12:08.846
- This is so crazy.
- Crazy!

12:08.937 --> 12:11.345
Claire, this whole thing is crazy.

12:11.440 --> 12:13.397
Maybe we should back off a little bit.

12:13.483 --> 12:16.935
You know what, Phil? No.
I am not gonna back off.

12:17.029 --> 12:20.528
Okay? I am doing this
for the safety of our neighborhood.

12:30.459 --> 12:33.626
Oh! Well, what's going on here?

12:33.712 --> 12:36.547
Hey, Cam.
Just getting rid of some negative energy.

12:36.632 --> 12:38.790
Oh. Well, in that case,
we'll be back Tuesday.

12:38.884 --> 12:41.209
You're all set, Mitch.

12:41.303 --> 12:43.675
- Oh, Barry.
- Hmm.

12:43.764 --> 12:45.840
- Oh, man, that was... that was great.
- Yeah?

12:45.933 --> 12:47.842
<i>Namaste,</i> man.

12:47.935 --> 12:49.595
- <i>Namaste.</i>
- <i>Namaste.</i>

12:49.686 --> 12:51.394
All right. I'm gonna get out of your hair.

12:51.480 --> 12:54.896
I'm gonna grab a quick tub
and see if I can rustle up some food.

12:54.983 --> 12:57.901
Oh, no. Hey, don't rustle.
We're making dinner tonight. You're coming.

12:57.986 --> 12:59.445
- Yeah, come down.
- Yeah?

12:59.530 --> 13:01.522
- Yes. Yes.
- Thank you, Mitch.

13:01.615 --> 13:04.569
- See? It's working already.
- Oh!

13:04.660 --> 13:06.154
- <i>Namaste.</i>

13:10.040 --> 13:12.033
- What?
- You know what I'm looking for.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.118
- He's a very nice guy.
- That's not it.

13:14.211 --> 13:16.203
- I'm sorry I made a snap judgment.
- Still not it.

13:16.296 --> 13:18.668
- You were right.
- <i>There</i> she is.

13:22.636 --> 13:24.095
Hello, Mitchell.

13:24.179 --> 13:27.180
Oh, Mrs. Ko.
I'm Cameron. Mitchell's the other one.

13:27.266 --> 13:30.136
- What are you doing here?
- I just finish showing the apartment upstairs.

13:30.227 --> 13:31.721
What do you mean? What about Barry?

13:31.812 --> 13:33.436
- Who's Barry?
- The new tenant.

13:33.522 --> 13:35.099
- Nobody living up there. It's empty.

13:35.190 --> 13:37.681
- But...
- You see anybody up there, you call me.

13:40.445 --> 13:42.237
I'm coming!

13:42.322 --> 13:45.323
You two so lucky
they don't let you get married.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.586
The problem wasn't me. It was Jay.

14:06.680 --> 14:08.803
He's a very bad teacher. Very bossy.

14:08.891 --> 14:10.634
I don't respond to that.

14:10.726 --> 14:13.976
I need somebody gentle, nurturing...
like a woman.

14:15.898 --> 14:18.021
Hey, Gloria. What's up?

14:18.108 --> 14:19.982
Can you teach me how to ride a bike?

14:20.068 --> 14:22.108
You can't ride a bike?
I love that about you.

14:22.196 --> 14:23.939
I was beginning to think
you didn't have any flaws.

14:24.031 --> 14:26.319
Listen, I wish I could,
but I'm late for an open house.

14:26.408 --> 14:27.736
- Oh.
- Yeah.

14:29.661 --> 14:31.321
- Really?
- Sure.

14:31.413 --> 14:34.699
I'm a great bike rider.
I've taught a bunch of my friends.

14:35.542 --> 14:37.582
I never taught anyone anything.

14:37.669 --> 14:40.587
But my playdate canceled,
so I was wide open.

14:44.801 --> 14:47.174
- Barry?
- Yep.

14:51.892 --> 14:53.351
Oh. Hey, Cameron.

14:53.435 --> 14:55.095
What are you doing in there?

14:55.187 --> 14:57.429
I'm just tidying up a little bit.
What's up?

14:57.523 --> 14:59.432
Are you living
in our daughter's princess castle?

14:59.525 --> 15:01.897
What? No. Don't be ridiculous.

15:01.985 --> 15:03.480
I'm living in here, man.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.029
I'm sleeping in there.

15:05.113 --> 15:07.272
You said you had just moved in upstairs.

15:07.366 --> 15:11.031
No, I said I just moved in. I'm...
I'm sorry. I thought it was implied...

15:11.119 --> 15:12.614
That you're living in a dollhouse?

15:12.704 --> 15:14.697
- Let's not do this outside, all right?

15:14.790 --> 15:16.782
You wanna go inside
and talk about this like two adults?

15:16.875 --> 15:18.998
- Yes, let's do that.
- Great.

15:19.086 --> 15:21.577
- No. No.
- It's okay. I just cleaned up.

15:24.842 --> 15:26.336
Come on in.

15:27.886 --> 15:30.128
Oh, my God. You <i>are</i> living in here!

15:30.222 --> 15:32.630
Shh, shh, shh, shh. Inside voices.

15:35.227 --> 15:36.638
All right.

15:37.312 --> 15:39.020
- Barry.
- Uh-huh?

15:39.106 --> 15:40.600
Are you homeless?

15:40.691 --> 15:42.648
Homeless?

15:42.734 --> 15:44.727
Are you insane? Look at this place.

15:44.820 --> 15:46.444
I mean...

15:46.530 --> 15:48.819
Okay, I can't even believe
I'm having to say this...

15:48.907 --> 15:52.691
- but you can't... you can't stay here.
- Oh, boy.

15:52.786 --> 15:55.657
This is about the bodywork
I did with Mitchell, isn't it?

15:55.747 --> 15:57.740
- I would understand if that was...
- No.

15:57.833 --> 16:01.118
You are living in a little girl's toy,
and you have to move out.

16:01.211 --> 16:03.583
- Well, this is gonna make dinner really awkward.
- There's no dinner.

16:03.672 --> 16:05.878
Dinner is off, okay?
Now come on. Let's go.

16:05.966 --> 16:08.635
No, no. Don't-Don't touch me.
I don't like to be touched.

16:08.719 --> 16:10.546
You're a massage therapist.

16:10.637 --> 16:12.677
I'm a Reiki master. Very little touching.

16:12.764 --> 16:14.674
Okay. Barry, listen to me.

16:14.766 --> 16:16.973
- Okay.
- You're a very nice man.

16:17.060 --> 16:19.551
- Mitchell and I like you very much.
- Thank you.

16:19.646 --> 16:22.896
But I'm... You're welcome.
I'm going to take your hand.

16:22.983 --> 16:25.189
Yes, I am.

16:25.277 --> 16:27.566
Don't give me the coyote look.
I'm not a canine.

16:27.654 --> 16:29.943
- We're gonna walk out of here together.
- Mmm.

16:30.032 --> 16:31.277
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

16:31.366 --> 16:33.359
- This is not gonna end very well.
- Let... Give me your hand.

16:39.625 --> 16:41.866
- Barry! Give me your...
- Oh.

16:45.130 --> 16:47.039
- What's happening?
- Barry's a nut!

16:47.132 --> 16:49.291
He's been living in Lily's castle! Ouch!

16:49.384 --> 16:53.299
- Hey, Mitchell.
- Oh, my God. I thought he was living upstairs.

16:53.388 --> 16:56.224
Just call the police. You want me to stop
and give you the whole story?

16:56.308 --> 16:58.265
I never... I never said upstairs.

16:58.352 --> 17:01.056
Mitchell, call 911!

17:01.146 --> 17:04.348
- Stop pinching me!
- Okay, just for the record, I was right.

17:04.441 --> 17:07.015
I still don't think you
should judge people!

17:07.109 --> 17:08.605
I said get off me!

17:08.694 --> 17:08.737
Okay, Gloria,
what scares you about riding a bike?

17:08.737 --> 17:12.236
Okay, Gloria,
what scares you about riding a bike?

17:12.324 --> 17:14.281
Losing control and falling down.

17:14.367 --> 17:15.826
Great. What else?

17:15.911 --> 17:17.489
Somebody grabbing me.

17:17.579 --> 17:19.618
That's weird. What else?

17:19.705 --> 17:22.079
- Looking foolish.
- Okay.

17:22.166 --> 17:24.409
See, all these bad thoughts
are holding you back.

17:24.502 --> 17:27.338
- Hmm.
- So how do we get rid of these bad thoughts?

17:28.423 --> 17:30.297
- We shoot 'em out.
- No, don't you dare.

17:30.384 --> 17:32.423
- Ride!
- Don't you dare!

17:32.511 --> 17:34.088
- Luke, stop it!
- Ride!

17:34.179 --> 17:36.670
- No! No, no!
- I said ride! Ride!

17:36.765 --> 17:39.303
- I'm gonna tell your mother!
- What, that you're riding a bike?

17:39.393 --> 17:41.184
No, that you're...

17:41.270 --> 17:43.428
Yes, I'm driving the bike!

17:43.522 --> 17:45.016
Whoo-hoo!

17:45.107 --> 17:47.514
<i> </i> <i>It was the
greatest feeling in the world.</i>

17:47.609 --> 17:50.978
Luke was right.
There was nothing to be afraid of.

17:51.071 --> 17:52.862
<i>Ay.</i>

18:01.164 --> 18:02.789
- Get off the bike!
- <i>¡Ay!</i> Don't grab me!

18:02.875 --> 18:04.701
- Give it to me.
- No, no. Don't grab me.

18:04.793 --> 18:06.252
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

18:06.336 --> 18:08.329
Laces, mirror, bell.

18:15.387 --> 18:18.056
Thanks so much for coming.
It was great to meet you both.

18:21.643 --> 18:23.719
- See you later.

18:23.812 --> 18:26.350
- How's it going?
- Hey. Great. Lots of people.

18:26.440 --> 18:29.061
- Listen, I was thinking about those signs.
- "Slow down your neighbors."

18:29.151 --> 18:31.274
Actually, I think they meant "Slow down,"
talking to you.

18:31.361 --> 18:33.401
- Who's talking? "Your neighbors."
- Anyway.

18:33.488 --> 18:36.110
Yeah, you think maybe it's possible
that you do drive a little too fast...

18:36.200 --> 18:38.239
in a residential neighborhood
with children present?

18:38.327 --> 18:41.244
Oh, Phil, I appreciate your concern,
but I'm not the problem.

18:41.330 --> 18:43.571
It's the crazy sign lady
who can't put a sentence together.

18:43.665 --> 18:45.160
That's your problem.

18:57.638 --> 19:00.592
Phil?

19:00.682 --> 19:02.342
- Honey?
- Claire?

19:02.434 --> 19:05.554
Oh, God. I gotta get some water.

19:05.646 --> 19:07.638
I was chasing that crazy maniac.

19:07.731 --> 19:09.391
I got so close.

19:09.483 --> 19:10.942
- And you just gave up?
- Mmm.

19:11.026 --> 19:13.861
That's not the Claire that I know.
Get back out there.

19:13.946 --> 19:15.440
- Really?
- Yeah.

19:15.531 --> 19:17.607
Phil, I left my phone at the drugstore.
I'll be right back.

19:17.699 --> 19:19.573
- Okay, bye.
- Hey, hi. I'm Claire Dunphy.

19:19.660 --> 19:22.151
- I'm Phil's wife.
- Let's not talk her ear off. She's gotta go.

19:22.246 --> 19:24.618
- I'm Laura. Nice to meet you.
- Oh, beautiful house.

19:24.706 --> 19:25.702
Thanks.

19:25.791 --> 19:27.618
- Hey, are you going by Greenleaf?
- Mmm.

19:27.709 --> 19:31.624
- Actually, yeah.
- I just overdid it on my bike. I cannot get back on there.

19:31.713 --> 19:34.287
- No problem. I'll give you a ride.
- That's a terrible idea.

19:34.383 --> 19:35.841
Why?

19:35.926 --> 19:37.919
<i>I wish I were one of those people...</i>

19:38.011 --> 19:40.681
who thrives on the danger
of leading a double life.

19:40.764 --> 19:44.465
You know, Bruce Wayne,
Peter Parker, Hannah Montana.

19:44.560 --> 19:47.763
That's a terrible idea...

19:47.855 --> 19:50.180
because your bike is here.

19:50.274 --> 19:52.895
What are you gonna do?
You leave it? That's rude.

19:52.985 --> 19:55.986
- Oh, just pick it up whenever.
- Whenever? What's whenever?

19:56.071 --> 19:58.111
- That's so open-ended.
- Oh, stop it.

19:58.198 --> 20:01.235
- Come on, Claire. Let's fly.
- I love her energy.

20:01.326 --> 20:02.821
I'm coming.

20:07.374 --> 20:09.746
So, why do you wanna move?

20:09.835 --> 20:12.290
Eh. I want a high-rise with a doorman.

20:12.379 --> 20:13.659
Mm-hmm.

20:13.755 --> 20:15.997
Besides, this neighborhood's
getting a little crazy.

20:16.091 --> 20:18.664
- Oh, tell me about it.
- There's this one wackjob.

20:18.760 --> 20:21.880
Don't say another word.
I bet I know exactly who you're thinking of.

20:34.860 --> 20:38.027
Claire was furious.
She said I betrayed her on every level.

20:38.113 --> 20:40.865
So, I called the florist...

20:40.949 --> 20:46.110
and I have ordered
one dozen Mylar balloons.

20:46.205 --> 20:48.612
Good luck staying mad, honey.

20:51.710 --> 20:51.752
- Which civilization invented the alphabet?
- I don't know.

20:51.752 --> 20:54.706
- Which civilization invented the alphabet?
- I don't know.

20:54.796 --> 20:57.584
Yes, you do.
We've been over this a hundred times.

20:57.674 --> 21:00.878
Allow me, Dad. I'm a great teacher.

21:00.969 --> 21:02.879
Who invented the alphabet?

21:02.971 --> 21:05.427
I... don't... know.

21:06.767 --> 21:09.472
- I got soaked! What are you doing?
- Say it!

21:09.561 --> 21:11.554
- Luke, that's enough.
- Oh, my God!

21:11.647 --> 21:14.434
I don't know! I don't know!
The Phoenicians! The Phoenicians!

21:15.400 --> 21:16.895
That's... right.

21:16.985 --> 21:18.859
Teacher of the year.

21:21.365 --> 21:22.859
She's all yours, buddy.

21:34.878 --> 21:35.909
