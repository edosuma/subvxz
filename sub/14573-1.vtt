**

00:04.772 --> 00:06.474
(Louie)
Um...

00:06.507 --> 00:09.810
I've been
doing comedy now for...

00:09.843 --> 00:12.146
uh, well, I started when
I was 18

00:12.180 --> 00:13.581
and now I'm 31...

00:13.614 --> 00:17.518
so, I think that's, that's
about-- No.

00:17.551 --> 00:20.554
I'm 46-- I just
turned 46 and I didn't--

00:20.588 --> 00:23.091
I thought last year I
was 44.

00:23.124 --> 00:24.758
That's how dumb I am.

00:24.792 --> 00:27.595
I totally was walking
around going, "Yeah, I'm 44."

00:27.628 --> 00:29.930
And then on my birthday,
somebody said,

00:29.963 --> 00:31.099
"How old are you today ?"

00:31.132 --> 00:32.500
And I said, "I'm 45."

00:32.533 --> 00:35.236
And my friend who knows me goes,
"No you're not.

00:35.269 --> 00:37.338
You were
45 all year-- You're 46 now."

00:37.371 --> 00:40.774
And I was like-- Like I aged two
years in like a minute.

00:40.808 --> 00:42.843
Like, "Oh...

00:42.876 --> 00:44.645
Ahh!"

00:47.981 --> 00:52.520
(truck motor rumbling)

00:52.553 --> 01:00.128
**

01:02.763 --> 01:06.434
(indistinct conversation)

01:06.467 --> 01:07.468
Hey...

01:07.501 --> 01:09.270
Listen--

01:09.303 --> 01:16.043
(indistinct conversation)

01:16.076 --> 01:18.946
(metal crashing)

01:18.979 --> 01:22.350
(indistinct conversation)

01:28.956 --> 01:30.391
Hey!

01:30.424 --> 01:33.294
Hey, hey listen!
Right up!

01:33.327 --> 01:34.462
Heads up!

01:34.495 --> 01:41.602
(garbage man)
Hey, let her go!
Hey!

01:41.635 --> 01:49.510
(crashing, metal banging)

01:52.146 --> 01:54.315
(hooting and hollering)

02:02.323 --> 02:06.126
We have an orangutan--
Come on!

02:06.160 --> 02:08.329
Oh!

02:14.034 --> 02:15.803
**

02:15.836 --> 02:17.805
(machine buzzing)

02:25.746 --> 02:27.648
Hey, what's up,
comedian?

02:27.681 --> 02:29.383
Hey, Tony--
How's it going?

02:29.417 --> 02:32.119
Hey, I got
a joke for you.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.321
It's not going to be
another racist--

02:33.354 --> 02:35.456
No, no, no--
This is about Pinocchio.

02:35.489 --> 02:36.890
I mean, you know Pinocchio,
right?

02:36.924 --> 02:38.226
Mm-hmm.

02:38.259 --> 02:40.228
So Pinocchio is going down
on this chick.

02:40.261 --> 02:41.895
Okay, I know--
No, no, no.

02:41.929 --> 02:45.366
So Pinocchio is like, going
down on his girlfriend, like,

02:45.399 --> 02:47.067
eating her pussy, you know?
I know this joke, Tony.

02:47.100 --> 02:49.503
I mean, Pinocchio is down
there eating pussy.

02:49.537 --> 02:52.306
I mean, he's down there
eating and licking it all up

02:52.340 --> 02:53.741
and she goes:

02:53.774 --> 02:56.844
"Oh yeah, oh yeah, eat that
pussy, Pinocchio!

02:56.877 --> 02:58.178
Come on, get it!"

02:58.212 --> 03:02.683
(laughing)

03:07.355 --> 03:08.922
I think
you got the joke wrong.

03:08.956 --> 03:11.058
No, I don't.

03:11.091 --> 03:15.028
Yeah, she's supposed to say,
"Lie to me, lie to me."

03:15.062 --> 03:16.730
See, 'cause see--

03:16.764 --> 03:19.066
His nose grows
and it goes in her vagina.

03:19.099 --> 03:20.268
That's--
No, no, no, no.

03:20.301 --> 03:21.935
You ruined it--
That's not the joke.

03:21.969 --> 03:23.404
Yes it is because...

03:23.437 --> 03:25.906
when Pinocchio lies,
his nose gets bigger.

03:25.939 --> 03:26.907
It goes up...

03:26.940 --> 03:28.909
No, no, no--
It's Pinocchio.

03:28.942 --> 03:31.445
I mean, the joke is it's
Pinocchio, you see?

03:31.479 --> 03:33.046
Pinocchio, he's a puppet.

03:33.080 --> 03:34.615
He's going down
there eating pussy.

03:34.648 --> 03:36.617
I mean, it's hilarious!

03:36.650 --> 03:38.218
Why do you
gotta clutter it up?

03:38.252 --> 03:41.088
I mean, aren't you
a comedian?

03:41.121 --> 03:47.595
**

03:49.797 --> 03:51.098
Ugly cocksucker.

03:51.131 --> 03:57.405
**

03:57.438 --> 04:00.040
So you want
to go to a movie later?

04:00.073 --> 04:01.275
By yourself?

04:01.309 --> 04:03.611
(laughing)

04:05.646 --> 04:07.114
Do you want to go to
a movie later?

04:07.147 --> 04:10.083
I can't-- I gotta pick up
the kids at school.

04:10.117 --> 04:12.486
Don't sound very excited
about it.

04:12.520 --> 04:14.655
I'm not particularly
excited about it.

04:14.688 --> 04:16.657
It's just, you
know what, it's Tuesday.

04:16.690 --> 04:17.958
And Tuesdays are hard,
'cause that's like,

04:17.991 --> 04:20.661
the transition
day between from, like,

04:20.694 --> 04:23.263
show hours, you know,
nighttime work

04:23.297 --> 04:24.965
to, like,
morning with the kids.

04:24.998 --> 04:26.233
Yeah.

04:26.266 --> 04:28.101
Get up early-- It's just
hard-- It's stressful.

04:28.135 --> 04:29.169
Yeah.

04:29.202 --> 04:31.104
Can I make a suggestion?

04:31.138 --> 04:32.306
Sure.

04:32.340 --> 04:33.674
Abandon your kids.

04:33.707 --> 04:36.076
Then you
can sleep later.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.678
No, I can't do that.

04:37.711 --> 04:38.812
Why not?

04:38.846 --> 04:40.280
You're not their mom--
You're their dad.

04:40.314 --> 04:42.483
No one
cares about dads.

04:42.516 --> 04:44.284
Dads don't matter, man.

04:44.318 --> 04:46.454
Is your
dad not around?

04:46.487 --> 04:49.423
My dad-- He's great.

04:49.457 --> 04:51.525
He showed me
unconditional continuous love

04:51.559 --> 04:53.461
since the day I
was born.

04:53.494 --> 04:55.128
I'd be
nowhere without my dad.

04:55.162 --> 04:58.599
So why is it okay for me to
walk out on my kids?

04:58.632 --> 05:00.300
Because your kids suck.

05:00.334 --> 05:03.003
(laughing)

05:03.036 --> 05:06.540
And you suck at comedy.

05:06.574 --> 05:09.877
I hate your kids-- I've
met them-- I don't like them.

05:09.910 --> 05:11.612
I drew little pictures
of them when I saw them

05:11.645 --> 05:16.484
and I ripped the pictures up
right in front of their faces.

05:17.317 --> 05:20.153
**

05:20.187 --> 05:21.822
Daddy.

05:21.855 --> 05:22.990
What?

05:23.023 --> 05:24.324
My backpack is
too heavy.

05:24.358 --> 05:25.893
Can you carry
it for me please?

05:25.926 --> 05:28.128
No, I would never do
that to you.

05:28.161 --> 05:29.329
Do what?

05:29.363 --> 05:30.731
Take your
burden away from you.

05:30.764 --> 05:32.299
Daddy, that's not taking,
that's helping.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.735
No, it's not because, see,
it would deprive you

05:34.768 --> 05:36.504
of your growth
and development.

05:36.537 --> 05:37.871
Daddy,
my back hurts.

05:37.905 --> 05:39.507
If I don't help
you and you struggle,

05:39.540 --> 05:41.041
then you get stronger.

05:41.074 --> 05:42.075
No.

05:42.109 --> 05:43.977
By doing more than you
believe you can do--

05:44.011 --> 05:45.145
That's not true.

05:45.178 --> 05:47.147
You put yourself in a moment
of doubt and pain--

05:47.180 --> 05:48.348
Just stop, just stop!

05:48.382 --> 05:50.518
Give it to me, give it
to me.

05:50.551 --> 05:52.386
Here--
Thank you, Lily.

05:52.420 --> 05:55.623
Shut up, Jane.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.929
What are you making
for dinner?

06:01.962 --> 06:04.031
Broccoli and pasta.

06:04.064 --> 06:05.566
Ew-- Yuck.

06:05.599 --> 06:09.737
Get away from me-- Get away--
get far away from me.

06:09.770 --> 06:10.738
"Yuck."

06:19.813 --> 06:20.781
Homework?

06:20.814 --> 06:22.816
Mm-hmm.

06:24.818 --> 06:26.286
"Dear AIDS"?

06:26.319 --> 06:28.221
We have to write a letter
to AIDS.

06:28.255 --> 06:31.459
As an assignment.

06:31.492 --> 06:32.726
Okay.

06:32.760 --> 06:35.128
I don't know
what to say to AIDS.

06:35.162 --> 06:36.697
Um...

06:36.730 --> 06:42.436
"Dear AIDS,
Please cut it out."

06:42.470 --> 06:46.640
Uh... "How's the weather
in AIDS Land?"

06:46.674 --> 06:50.778
It's not funny, Dad--
It's serious.

06:50.811 --> 06:51.779
Okay.

06:51.812 --> 06:54.314
It's very serious.

06:54.347 --> 06:56.450
Very serious.

06:56.484 --> 06:58.919
"Dear AIDS."

07:00.153 --> 07:04.792
Daddy, do the Beatles.

07:04.825 --> 07:06.627
Daddy, can
I get my own bedroom?

07:06.660 --> 07:09.296
Not really, there's no more
rooms in this apartment.

07:09.329 --> 07:10.430
Can we move?

07:10.464 --> 07:13.967
(laughing)
No.

07:14.001 --> 07:17.871
Goodnight.
(kissing)
Goodnight.

07:19.473 --> 07:23.677
Do the Beatles!

07:23.711 --> 07:25.412
Daddy, are you going
out tonight?

07:25.445 --> 07:26.980
Yeah, but not till
you're sleeping.

07:27.014 --> 07:28.482
But who's
going to stay with us?

07:28.516 --> 07:30.450
It doesn't
matter, you'll be asleep.

07:30.484 --> 07:32.452
Yeah, but who?

07:32.486 --> 07:33.621
Mrs. Frame.

07:33.654 --> 07:36.690
(kids)
Ew!
Okay, don't do that.

07:36.724 --> 07:38.526
Daddy.
No...

07:38.559 --> 07:40.460
Goodnight.

07:40.494 --> 07:41.995
Daddy, please.
What?

07:42.029 --> 07:43.631
Do the Beatles.
No, goodnight.

07:43.664 --> 07:44.798
Daddy, do the Beatles--
Please!

07:44.832 --> 07:47.134
Daddy, please.
Come on.

07:47.167 --> 07:50.771
Please.

07:50.804 --> 07:52.540
(English accent)
Hello, I'm John.

07:52.573 --> 07:54.141
And I'm Paul.

07:54.174 --> 07:55.475
And I'm George.

07:55.509 --> 07:56.977
And I'm Ringo.

07:57.010 --> 07:58.345
(giggling)

07:58.378 --> 07:59.513
All right, goodnight.

07:59.547 --> 08:00.548
Good night.

08:00.581 --> 08:03.651
Goodnight, Daddy.

08:06.153 --> 08:08.321
I'll be back
in just a couple hours.

08:08.355 --> 08:10.624
Okay, that's fine.

08:10.658 --> 08:11.959
Uh, thanks
for helping out again.

08:11.992 --> 08:17.030
I appreciate it.
Okay, that's fine.

08:17.064 --> 08:18.031
But life is short.

08:18.065 --> 08:20.968
A lot of people are fond
of saying that.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.570
Life is short.

08:22.603 --> 08:24.071
And it is.

08:24.104 --> 08:27.374
Life is short if,
uh, you're a child who died.

08:27.407 --> 08:30.678
But it's...

08:30.711 --> 08:31.845
it's not.

08:31.879 --> 08:33.914
At 46
it's not short anymore.

08:33.947 --> 08:35.583
It's long, man-- Life is--

08:35.616 --> 08:37.885
It feels like it's taking
a long time

08:37.918 --> 08:40.053
to get through this shit.

08:40.087 --> 08:41.021
This is long.

08:41.054 --> 08:42.590
There are
days that are long.

08:42.623 --> 08:44.257
You ever have a day where
you're like,

08:44.291 --> 08:45.926
"All right with this one--

08:45.959 --> 08:50.698
"Can we just-- On and on,
this one goes.

08:50.731 --> 08:53.166
"Can I go to bed yet?

08:53.200 --> 08:56.236
"It's four p.m.--
I'm going to bed.

08:56.269 --> 08:58.271
That's p.m."

08:58.305 --> 09:01.675
If it was socially acceptable
to go to bed at four p.m.

09:01.709 --> 09:06.279
and wake up at two p.m.,
I would totally do that.

09:06.313 --> 09:09.216
If it was socially acceptable
to have an electric wheelchair

09:09.249 --> 09:14.554
when there's
nothing wrong with you.

09:17.257 --> 09:21.094
**

09:21.128 --> 09:23.196
Okay, I'll call.

09:23.230 --> 09:24.264
Oh, shit.

09:24.297 --> 09:25.365
What's the matter?

09:25.398 --> 09:27.534
I forgot
to jack off today.

09:27.567 --> 09:28.769
You forgot?

09:28.802 --> 09:30.437
Yeah, I guess
it just slipped my mind.

09:30.470 --> 09:31.805
You need a personal
assistant.

09:31.839 --> 09:33.907
You should tie
a string around your finger.

09:33.941 --> 09:36.276
How many times a day
you jack off?

09:36.309 --> 09:37.444
Maybe once.

09:37.477 --> 09:39.613
I'm old now--
It used to be seven.

09:39.647 --> 09:41.281
Used to be
like, seven, exactly?

09:41.314 --> 09:42.582
Seven on the nose.

09:42.616 --> 09:44.718
On the no--
You jerk off on your nose?

09:44.752 --> 09:46.386
(laughing)

09:46.419 --> 09:47.921
Gym, tan, laundry.

09:47.955 --> 09:49.990
(Louie)
What?
I don't know.

09:50.023 --> 09:50.958
(man)
GTL.

09:50.991 --> 09:52.392
Who jacks
off the most here?

09:52.425 --> 09:53.627
I'll volunteer.

09:53.661 --> 09:56.163
I'm good for between six
and eight a day

09:56.196 --> 09:58.398
depending on
what else I got going on.

09:58.431 --> 09:59.667
That sounds like
a lot.

09:59.700 --> 10:00.768
Does to my neighbors.

10:00.801 --> 10:02.102
(chuckling)
How about you?

10:02.135 --> 10:04.337
How many times do you do
whatever you guys do?

10:04.371 --> 10:06.273
(laughing)

10:06.306 --> 10:08.608
(Sarah)
Maybe even up to like four or
five times if I'm home sick.

10:08.642 --> 10:10.310
Really.
Not homesick, but home.

10:10.343 --> 10:11.645
Not feeling well.

10:11.679 --> 10:13.113
And I'm always pressing it.

10:13.146 --> 10:16.583
If I'm home,
I'm like, pressing on it.

10:16.616 --> 10:17.751
If I'm home alone.

10:17.785 --> 10:18.986
What do you mean,
pressing it?

10:19.019 --> 10:20.821
I don't know, I'm like,
pressing it.

10:20.854 --> 10:22.690
What is it, a Panini?

10:22.723 --> 10:23.991
(laughing)

10:24.024 --> 10:25.492
What kind
of toys do you use?

10:25.525 --> 10:27.961
Why does everyone think
that girls need toys to get off?

10:27.995 --> 10:29.596
'Cause I need toys to
get off.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.264
What, like a fire truck?

10:31.298 --> 10:32.966
Like a chess set?

10:33.000 --> 10:34.301
Frisbee?

10:34.334 --> 10:36.804
(all laughing)

10:36.837 --> 10:38.638
Your niece's Big Wheel?

10:38.672 --> 10:40.007
(laughing)

10:40.040 --> 10:41.474
(Jim)
Can I explain?

10:41.508 --> 10:44.778
This is for real.

10:44.812 --> 10:46.013
He's all upset.

10:46.046 --> 10:48.148
"Come on, fellas, give me
a chance."

10:48.181 --> 10:49.783
Yeah, I mean,
you're asking me something,

10:49.817 --> 10:51.484
I'm trying to tell you
and all of a sudden.

10:51.518 --> 10:52.786
You use toys?

10:52.820 --> 10:54.121
Yeah-- I got a vibrator
and a dildo.

10:54.154 --> 10:56.724
A dildo?
Yeah, a dildo.

10:56.757 --> 10:58.525
How do
you use them?

10:58.558 --> 10:59.659
It's no
great mystery.

10:59.693 --> 11:00.961
Yeah, it is.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.295
No, it's not.
No, it really is.

11:02.329 --> 11:03.563
No, it's not.

11:03.596 --> 11:05.966
No-- I hold the vibrator
against the shaft

11:05.999 --> 11:08.635
and then I slowly
rotate it against the balls.

11:08.668 --> 11:12.205
I love the way he talks about
his dick in the third person.

11:12.239 --> 11:13.306
Third person!

11:13.340 --> 11:15.008
I start off with
a nice circular motion

11:15.042 --> 11:16.744
and then I pick
up speed.

11:16.777 --> 11:18.311
And then kablowy.

11:18.345 --> 11:19.179
(laughing)

11:19.212 --> 11:21.982
Kablowy--
You come like Batman?

11:22.015 --> 11:23.416
(Louie)
Very nice.
Yeah.

11:23.450 --> 11:26.053
Yeah, a little sign shoots
out of my dick.

11:26.086 --> 11:27.587
Right into
Robin's mouth.

11:27.620 --> 11:30.257
(laughing)

11:30.290 --> 11:33.761
You need to tell us, where
does the dildo go?

11:33.794 --> 11:35.763
Oh, it stays in
the drawer.

11:35.796 --> 11:42.903
But that's--
my question is how.

11:42.936 --> 11:44.671
(laughing)

11:44.704 --> 11:47.107
No, it's just knowing that
I have a dildo in the drawer.

11:47.140 --> 11:48.575
It makes me feel bad.

11:48.608 --> 11:49.609
And that helps
me come.

11:49.642 --> 11:52.279
(laughing)

11:52.312 --> 11:53.280
Jesus.

11:53.313 --> 11:57.184
Oh my God, Jim,
I love you so much.

11:57.217 --> 11:59.119
All right, all right--
We need a ruling on this.

11:59.152 --> 12:00.453
Is that gay?

12:00.487 --> 12:02.555
Well, as the Chief Justice of
the Supreme Court

12:02.589 --> 12:04.457
of Everything That's Gay,

12:04.491 --> 12:05.425
that's pretty gay.

12:05.458 --> 12:06.760
It's not gay.

12:06.794 --> 12:07.928
Oh, it's pretty gay.
No it's not.

12:07.961 --> 12:08.929
Yeah.
That's the point.

12:08.962 --> 12:10.397
That's pretty gay.

12:10.430 --> 12:12.800
If I was gay, I'd just ram
that jolly dildo

12:12.833 --> 12:14.401
right up
my stupid asshole.

12:14.434 --> 12:15.769
Thatta girl.

12:15.803 --> 12:17.404
It's because I'm straight

12:17.437 --> 12:21.308
and I know that I got this big
black dildo in my desk drawer--

12:21.341 --> 12:23.310
Oh, it's black.

12:23.343 --> 12:25.112
You have a desk?

12:25.145 --> 12:26.546
You see?

12:26.579 --> 12:27.614
It's long.

12:27.647 --> 12:28.782
It should say on
the dildo

12:28.816 --> 12:31.318
"From the desk
of Jim Norton."

12:31.351 --> 12:33.553
I've never known a guy to
have a vibrator.

12:33.586 --> 12:34.721
How do you--

12:34.754 --> 12:35.989
A vibrator makes
you come?

12:36.023 --> 12:39.626
Oh, it makes
me come so good.

12:39.659 --> 12:42.595
That-- it's taken my orgasms
from threes to 10s.

12:42.629 --> 12:44.597
I don't even fantasize
about choking you anymore.

12:44.631 --> 12:47.134
(laughing)

12:47.167 --> 12:50.103
That little gizmo
has made my life good.

12:50.137 --> 12:51.438
Really-- It's that good?

12:51.471 --> 12:52.439
Oh.

12:52.472 --> 12:54.842
Asks the future purchaser
of a vibrator.

12:54.875 --> 12:56.109
You want
to borrow mine, Lou?

12:56.143 --> 12:57.677
No, I'm not asking--

12:57.710 --> 13:01.281
"No, I'm not gonna go get a
vibrator immediately."

13:01.314 --> 13:03.817
Not pre-owned.
I'm just curious.

13:06.053 --> 13:07.187
Dude, did you
see the other day,

13:07.220 --> 13:08.989
the guy who stole
the panties?

13:09.022 --> 13:10.590
(woman)
No, what happened?

13:10.623 --> 13:11.959
I just stopped him.

13:11.992 --> 13:13.961
I scared him, he dropped them
and he just ran out.

13:13.994 --> 13:15.628
(laughing)

13:15.662 --> 13:16.830
Always happens.

13:16.864 --> 13:18.365
Hilarious.

13:21.468 --> 13:24.471
Hi, can I help you find
something?

13:24.504 --> 13:27.207
Um...

13:27.240 --> 13:31.211
Just, uh...
some vibrators.

13:31.244 --> 13:32.479
Okay.
Some vibrators.

13:32.512 --> 13:34.514
If you have any.
It's no problem

13:34.547 --> 13:36.283
We have some here.

13:36.316 --> 13:39.953
Is this
for your girlfriend?

13:39.987 --> 13:41.955
This is for you?

13:41.989 --> 13:43.857
That's no problem.

13:43.891 --> 13:45.692
I can personally recommend
these.

13:45.725 --> 13:47.127
It's kind of-- Those
are silvery.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.695
I don't know
about the silvery thing.

13:48.728 --> 13:49.963
Okay.

13:49.997 --> 13:51.498
We have a few
more colors here.

13:51.531 --> 13:54.334
I think we need to stop
ordering cock rings.

13:54.367 --> 13:55.802
Well, I'm not
ordering the cock rings.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.337
They're building up.

13:57.370 --> 13:59.572
I didn't have anything to do
with all those cock rings.

13:59.606 --> 14:00.740
We have a whole bunch.

14:00.773 --> 14:03.310
Better talk to Niecey.

14:03.343 --> 14:04.912
Was there anything else you
were interested in?

14:04.945 --> 14:08.415
Well, I don't know
about the penis-colored ones.

14:08.448 --> 14:09.416
Okay.

14:09.449 --> 14:10.583
Um, well--

14:10.617 --> 14:12.152
What about the--
Ahh!

14:12.185 --> 14:13.553
Sorry.
Are you okay?

14:13.586 --> 14:15.088
Ahh.

14:15.122 --> 14:16.589
I don't know
what I just did.

14:16.623 --> 14:17.657
Ah.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.092
Do you
need me to call someone?

14:19.126 --> 14:20.160
Ah.

14:20.193 --> 14:21.561
No, no, no.

14:21.594 --> 14:23.563
Do you want to sit down--
I can call an ambulance.

14:23.596 --> 14:25.332
No, no, no, thank
you, thank you very much.

14:25.365 --> 14:26.366
Ah.

14:26.399 --> 14:27.400
Okay.
Oh.

14:27.434 --> 14:32.105
**

14:44.117 --> 14:46.786
Yo, look at him sitting all
fat on the curb.

14:46.819 --> 14:50.991
Shit.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.928
Taxi.

14:54.962 --> 14:56.696
Taxi, taxi!

14:56.729 --> 14:59.232
Taxi, taxi, please.

15:00.333 --> 15:02.469
Are you okay-- Did you fall
down?

15:02.502 --> 15:04.137
No, no, I hurt my back.

15:04.171 --> 15:06.273
Should I, should I call
an ambulance?

15:06.306 --> 15:08.041
No, thank you very--
No, thank you.

15:08.075 --> 15:10.877
I'm just trying to get a taxi
and I can't get high enough.

15:10.910 --> 15:16.783
Taxi, Taxi!
Oh.

15:16.816 --> 15:21.654
**

15:21.688 --> 15:25.425
I didn't--
Oh.

15:26.693 --> 15:28.495
Oww!

15:28.528 --> 15:31.331
Oh...oh.

15:34.201 --> 15:37.337
Thank you very much.
Oh.

15:48.648 --> 15:51.618
**

16:08.668 --> 16:11.471
(door bell buzzing)

16:11.504 --> 16:12.705
(dog barking)

16:14.141 --> 16:16.309
(dog barking)

16:32.659 --> 16:33.693
Hello.

16:33.726 --> 16:35.495
Yes?

16:35.528 --> 16:38.165
Uh, I'm, uh, I live in
the building

16:38.198 --> 16:39.866
and I
have-- my doctor.

16:39.899 --> 16:41.801
I have a doctor,
but he's dead.

16:41.834 --> 16:45.138
So, I guess
I was just wondering

16:45.172 --> 16:48.341
if I could meet Dr. Bigelow
about maybe

16:48.375 --> 16:50.543
being his patient
starting now

16:50.577 --> 16:52.645
because I
have a back thing.

16:52.679 --> 16:56.049
Well, the doctor
is eating his lunch.

16:56.083 --> 16:58.151
But let me see.

16:58.185 --> 17:00.087
That's all right--
I'll just check with him.

17:00.120 --> 17:03.223
Thank you--
Thank you.

17:07.360 --> 17:09.229
He'll see you now--
Go right in.

17:09.262 --> 17:10.430
Thank you so much.

17:10.463 --> 17:15.068
Thank you very
much.

17:48.568 --> 17:51.604
What can
I do for you?

17:51.638 --> 17:54.841
Uh, well, I hurt my back
today really bad.

18:00.980 --> 18:02.582
Uh.

18:02.615 --> 18:04.417
Can you help me with
my back?

18:04.451 --> 18:06.286
I mean...

18:06.319 --> 18:07.720
What's wrong
with your back?

18:07.754 --> 18:10.657
It hurts.

18:10.690 --> 18:13.826
My professional diagnosis is
your back hurts.

18:13.860 --> 18:15.528
Well, what
can I do about it?

18:18.965 --> 18:20.433
Nothing.

18:20.467 --> 18:21.601
Nothing?

18:21.634 --> 18:25.172
The problem is
you're using it wrong.

18:25.205 --> 18:30.277
The back isn't done
evolving yet.

18:30.310 --> 18:34.281
You see, the spine
is a row of vertebrae.

18:34.314 --> 18:37.150
It was designed to be
horizontal.

18:37.184 --> 18:41.788
Then people came
along and used it vertical.

18:41.821 --> 18:42.922
Wasn't meant for that.

18:42.955 --> 18:47.026
So the disks
get all floppy, swollen.

18:47.059 --> 18:49.462
Pop out left, pop
out right.

18:49.496 --> 18:52.765
It'll take another.

18:52.799 --> 18:54.967
I'd say 20,000 years to get
straightened out.

18:55.001 --> 18:56.669
Till then,
it's going to keep hurting.

18:56.703 --> 18:57.804
So that's it?

18:57.837 --> 18:59.972
It's an engineering design
problem.

19:00.006 --> 19:02.375
It's a misallocation.

19:02.409 --> 19:05.612
We were
given a clothesline

19:05.645 --> 19:09.982
and we're using it as
a flagpole.

19:10.016 --> 19:12.452
So what should I do?

19:12.485 --> 19:14.454
Use your back
as it was intended.

19:14.487 --> 19:19.158
Walk around on your hands
and feet.

19:19.192 --> 19:21.127
Or accept
the fact that your back

19:21.160 --> 19:22.529
is going to hurt
sometimes.

19:22.562 --> 19:27.800
Be very grateful for
the moments that it doesn't.

19:27.834 --> 19:31.137
Every second spent without
back pain

19:31.170 --> 19:33.740
is a lucky second.

19:33.773 --> 19:35.975
String enough of those lucky
seconds together,

19:36.008 --> 19:39.346
you have
a lucky minute.

19:42.949 --> 19:44.551
Okay.

19:44.584 --> 19:46.853
Come see me when you have
something fun

19:46.886 --> 19:48.888
like a blood disease.

19:48.921 --> 19:52.859
That's what I
went to school for.

19:55.928 --> 19:57.530
Okay, I think I
got it.

19:57.564 --> 19:59.732
All right.
Thank you very much.

19:59.766 --> 20:01.434
Bad back, huh?

20:01.468 --> 20:03.836
Yeah--
I guess there's no cure.

20:03.870 --> 20:07.374
Want to
know what I do?

20:07.407 --> 20:09.876
My back always hurts because
of this chair.

20:09.909 --> 20:12.078
This really works.

20:12.111 --> 20:13.280
(whirring)

20:13.313 --> 20:16.949
You just rub it all over
your upper back,

20:16.983 --> 20:19.286
lower,

20:19.319 --> 20:22.955
wherever
you can reach.

20:22.989 --> 20:25.725
Mmm.

20:25.758 --> 20:27.093
Oh.

20:27.126 --> 20:29.762
(audience laughing)

20:29.796 --> 20:33.065
(Louie)
Yeah, life is
long and then it's over.

20:33.099 --> 20:36.303
And, uh, a lot of people wonder
what happens after that.

20:36.336 --> 20:37.604
What happens after you die?

20:37.637 --> 20:40.106
It's a big question for
human beings.

20:40.139 --> 20:41.608
What happens after you die?

20:41.641 --> 20:43.810
Actually, lots of things happen
after you die,

20:43.843 --> 20:46.913
just none
of them include you.

20:46.946 --> 20:52.251
'Cause. you're not in
anything anymore.

20:52.285 --> 20:53.486
But there's
all kinds of shit.

20:53.520 --> 20:56.323
There's the Super Bowl
every year

20:56.356 --> 21:01.027
and there's
a dog catching a Frisbee.

21:03.763 --> 21:05.798
I just met somebody who's 31
and she was like,

21:05.832 --> 21:09.436
"I'm getting
old, I'm in my 30s."

21:09.469 --> 21:11.738
31 is not old.

21:11.771 --> 21:13.640
Maybe you think that when you
turn 31, but it's not.

21:13.673 --> 21:16.943
You don't know till
you're 46, which is what I am,

21:16.976 --> 21:19.912
how young 31 really is.

21:19.946 --> 21:23.149
31 is young enough
that you could murder somebody

21:23.182 --> 21:27.687
and get caught and still have
a pretty good life.
