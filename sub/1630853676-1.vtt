WEBVTT

00:40.413 --> 00:42.215
This is Dr. Evelyn Sawyer.

00:42.250 --> 00:44.415
The date is March 13.

00:44.450 --> 00:49.849
I'm here with James
Fisher, prisoner ID B1359.

00:49.884 --> 00:51.422
Continuing
psychological assessment

00:51.457 --> 00:56.724
for criminal court
case 21-1-90305

00:56.759 --> 00:58.099
at the behest of the state.

01:04.932 --> 01:06.767
James, I need a few
more details about what

01:06.802 --> 01:09.275
took place last summer.

01:09.310 --> 01:11.376
Sounds great.

01:11.411 --> 01:13.180
This is the last time.

01:13.215 --> 01:14.874
I promise.

01:14.909 --> 01:18.515
I feel like I've
heard that before.

01:18.550 --> 01:21.221
I'd like to talk
about motivation.

01:21.256 --> 01:23.388
Can we start with
the assignment?

01:23.423 --> 01:25.456
Sure.

01:25.491 --> 01:27.293
OK.

01:27.328 --> 01:32.595
In your own words, please
describe it for me.

01:32.630 --> 01:34.531
I was instructed
to protect a body.

01:40.308 --> 01:42.374
Did anything seem
out of the ordinary,

01:42.409 --> 01:46.213
either about the assignment
or anything in general?

01:51.649 --> 01:55.321
I'm trying to help you James.

01:55.356 --> 01:55.783
Are you?

01:58.689 --> 02:00.623
I'm your last chance
to save yourself.

02:06.433 --> 02:08.334
All of it.

02:08.369 --> 02:08.796
Excuse me?

02:14.870 --> 02:17.244
All of it felt out
of the ordinary.

02:25.683 --> 02:27.650
Winters left.

02:27.685 --> 02:29.916
Broke protocol.

02:29.951 --> 02:31.291
And I didn't have a vehicle.

02:35.396 --> 02:37.297
Don't stop.

02:37.332 --> 02:38.826
We're close.

02:38.861 --> 02:40.300
You've got to keep digging.

02:54.547 --> 02:57.680
What did you just say?

02:57.715 --> 03:00.617
You're holding something back.

03:00.652 --> 03:01.552
Help me see it.

03:04.590 --> 03:05.325
Help you see it?

03:10.860 --> 03:11.298
OK.

03:26.876 --> 03:31.582
This is MAtia Ableman, 43.

03:31.617 --> 03:34.519
Hikers found her last night.

03:34.554 --> 03:37.753
Lucky they did, people don't
come through here often.

03:37.788 --> 03:38.919
What the hell was she doing?

03:43.057 --> 03:45.761
When does the coroner get here?

03:45.796 --> 03:47.532
Hes doesn't.

03:47.567 --> 03:49.600
What?

03:49.635 --> 03:51.030
Why not?

03:51.065 --> 03:52.867
When we notified
her family they said

03:52.902 --> 03:54.737
they needed to come pick her up.

03:54.772 --> 03:56.574
Nobody else.

03:56.609 --> 03:58.378
Can they do that?

03:58.413 --> 04:01.579
According to their
lawyer they can.

04:01.614 --> 04:05.748
But the ME said that she
died from natural causes,

04:05.783 --> 04:08.751
so it doesn't really matter.

04:08.786 --> 04:14.889
So we just hang out
and babysit a DB?

04:14.924 --> 04:17.463
Yep.

04:17.498 --> 04:20.829
Family was adamant that nothing
happen to her until then.

04:20.864 --> 04:24.030
Happens to her?

04:24.065 --> 04:26.670
What else could happen
to her, she's dead.

04:26.705 --> 04:28.540
No disrespect.

04:28.575 --> 04:31.576
For Christ sake's Fisher.

04:31.611 --> 04:33.644
They asked us to watch
her so we watch her.

04:46.593 --> 04:48.087
You OK?

04:48.122 --> 04:49.594
Yeah.

04:50.432 --> 04:50.793
Fine.

04:53.831 --> 04:55.600
Is there something
you're not telling me?

04:58.803 --> 04:59.406
Sure?

05:02.807 --> 05:03.410
No.

05:06.811 --> 05:09.449
It's just really odd.

05:11.717 --> 05:13.079
The way that they said it.

05:15.622 --> 05:20.020
There was real urgency.

05:23.828 --> 05:26.994
Protect the body.

05:28.030 --> 05:30.899
They emphasized
that a few times.

05:31.165 --> 05:33.539
Protect the body from what?

05:34.641 --> 05:36.509
I don't know.

05:37.138 --> 05:38.137
They didn't say.

05:38.172 --> 05:39.380
You didn't ask?

05:53.022 --> 05:55.121
Look Fisher, if
this was your sister

05:55.156 --> 05:56.496
would you want her
out here alone?

06:00.535 --> 06:02.502
It's the least we could do.

06:03.670 --> 06:04.834
That is the job.

06:06.772 --> 06:08.442
Serve and Protect.

06:32.567 --> 06:35.568
This is Mobile Unit
1, copy that 10-96.

06:35.603 --> 06:36.536
Is this a Code 1?

06:36.571 --> 06:36.932
Over.

06:38.001 --> 06:38.736
Code 1.

06:38.771 --> 06:39.503
Over.

06:41.268 --> 06:42.773
We gotta get these
planes for Lucy.

06:42.808 --> 06:44.544
Come on.

06:44.579 --> 06:46.612
Dig.

06:46.647 --> 06:47.943
All right Fisher,
looks like you're

06:47.978 --> 06:50.748
going to have to keep
watch until I get back.

06:51.113 --> 06:52.750
Wait, what?

06:58.252 --> 06:58.855
Alone?

07:03.961 --> 07:06.533
Looks like it.

07:06.568 --> 07:07.600
OK, fine.

07:07.635 --> 07:11.703
But what are the rules?

07:11.738 --> 07:12.539
Rules.

07:12.574 --> 07:12.935
Yeah.

07:17.810 --> 07:18.545
Protect the body.

07:21.616 --> 07:21.977
Got it.

07:28.656 --> 07:30.249
I'll be back to help
in a couple of hours.

07:50.007 --> 07:51.138
It's you and me.

07:59.885 --> 08:01.247
Relax Fisher, it could be worse.

08:30.883 --> 08:34.588
Really, five minutes in
and we're doing this?

08:37.153 --> 08:40.352
OK Fisher, come on.

08:40.387 --> 08:44.862
Everything had a
feeling to it that day.

08:44.897 --> 08:47.062
Wrong feeling.

08:47.097 --> 08:55.301
That circle she was in, the
woods, the truck, that cabin.

08:55.336 --> 08:56.335
All of it.

08:58.878 --> 09:00.141
Wrong.

09:00.814 --> 09:01.681
How?

09:03.751 --> 09:06.345
It was alive.

09:06.380 --> 09:08.820
Alive?

09:08.855 --> 09:10.217
Yeah.

09:10.252 --> 09:11.922
They put those flowers there.

09:16.060 --> 09:17.730
The red poppy?

09:17.765 --> 09:21.261
The one you mentioned
in the report?

09:21.296 --> 09:23.901
It was a puzzle piece.

09:23.936 --> 09:27.168
Lucy collected flowers.

09:27.203 --> 09:28.004
She had this list.

09:31.438 --> 09:35.374
And you believe
it was put there.

09:35.409 --> 09:37.750
It couldn't have
just been there?

09:52.426 --> 09:53.062
No way.

09:56.265 --> 09:59.101
Winters should have never left.

09:59.136 --> 10:02.236
Do you blame her?

10:02.271 --> 10:06.108
Everything changed after that.

10:06.143 --> 10:09.078
They wanted me to
go into that truck.

10:09.113 --> 10:12.444
They had something to show me.

10:12.479 --> 10:16.118
Who are we talking about James?

10:16.153 --> 10:16.723
Who are they?

10:20.289 --> 10:21.761
The keepers of the puzzle.

10:24.260 --> 10:26.832
The ones who control the game.

10:29.837 --> 10:32.772
Are we talking about
God and the devil?

10:37.306 --> 10:39.911
Sure.

10:39.946 --> 10:42.309
If that helps you understand.

10:53.454 --> 10:59.194
Were these keepers
controlling you?

11:14.882 --> 11:21.887
Ah, Oh, Oh, Jesus.

11:28.896 --> 11:29.730
Oh my God.

11:46.914 --> 11:47.880
Asshole bird.

11:58.893 --> 12:00.321
What did you eat?

12:04.360 --> 12:06.393
Oh God, it's in my eye.

12:55.378 --> 12:58.115
Matia Ableman.

12:58.150 --> 13:00.414
Curator of Occult Antiquities.

13:06.290 --> 13:09.621
Antiquities.

13:09.656 --> 13:10.055
Really?

13:10.090 --> 13:10.996
That's a job?

13:21.041 --> 13:22.909
What is this?

13:26.277 --> 13:27.848
What in the world?

13:34.021 --> 13:34.987
Soul gathering.

13:57.209 --> 14:00.012
What?

14:00.047 --> 14:01.442
Oh, you're kidding me.

14:06.218 --> 14:09.516
What the hell were you
doing out here Mrs Ableman?

14:23.169 --> 14:25.499
Whoa.

14:25.534 --> 14:28.469
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:32.409 --> 14:32.913
Weird shit.

15:02.505 --> 15:03.240
Winters, that you?

15:03.275 --> 15:04.109
Over.

15:07.444 --> 15:10.115
Winters, what time did you say
they were going to get her?

15:10.150 --> 15:10.582
Over.

15:13.450 --> 15:14.383
You there partner?

15:14.418 --> 15:17.683
Come back.

15:17.718 --> 15:19.223
Unit, report your call sign.

15:19.258 --> 15:22.094
Over.

15:22.129 --> 15:23.062
Call sign?

15:23.097 --> 15:24.393
Let's see, callsign.

15:24.428 --> 15:27.264
How about Tweedle Dee.

15:27.299 --> 15:28.232
Which would make you--

15:28.267 --> 15:29.266
Unit, please report.

15:29.301 --> 15:30.762
Over.

15:30.797 --> 15:31.429
Nope.

15:31.465 --> 15:33.303
That would be Tweedle Dumb.

15:33.338 --> 15:35.734
Sir, this is an
official channel.

15:35.769 --> 15:37.340
You need to desist immediately.

15:37.375 --> 15:38.143
Over.

15:41.115 --> 15:42.411
Desist.

15:42.446 --> 15:45.117
First rodeo then?

15:45.152 --> 15:48.450
Sir, this is a
restricted frequency.

15:48.485 --> 15:50.254
What you're doing
is against the law.

15:50.289 --> 15:52.223
Over.

15:52.258 --> 15:54.093
OK, OK cowboy.

15:54.128 --> 15:56.293
Just though you could use
a second pair of eyes.

15:56.328 --> 15:58.163
That's all.

15:58.198 --> 16:00.297
Help you see what
you're not seeing.

16:00.332 --> 16:03.531
Sir, you need to keep
this frequency clear.

16:03.566 --> 16:04.664
Over and out.

18:52.702 --> 18:55.967
This is important to
clarify for the jury.

18:56.002 --> 19:00.840
From that moment, when you
touched the deceased's hand,

19:00.875 --> 19:02.347
is that when they took control?

19:05.946 --> 19:06.516
Control.

19:11.721 --> 19:14.656
I would flash from one place to
another with no memory of how

19:14.691 --> 19:17.494
I got there.

19:17.529 --> 19:18.297
Things just happened.

19:21.995 --> 19:23.533
Why didn't you call for help?

19:25.834 --> 19:28.835
They wouldn't let me.

19:28.870 --> 19:31.574
Did you talk to them?

19:31.609 --> 19:33.939
No.

19:33.974 --> 19:36.216
Then how did you know what
they wanted you to do?

19:39.045 --> 19:46.688
I could feel them inside,
worming around, poking at me.

19:50.925 --> 19:52.232
And you couldn't stop them?

19:54.566 --> 19:55.400
Clearly.

20:02.904 --> 20:06.873
James, is it your
belief that you are

20:06.908 --> 20:09.315
possessed by a demonic entity?

20:15.455 --> 20:18.423
Hey, you're the expert.

21:02.029 --> 21:03.028
Holy shit.

21:14.811 --> 21:15.612
Winter, come back.

21:15.647 --> 21:16.481
Over.

21:19.915 --> 21:20.683
Winters, come in.

21:20.718 --> 21:21.486
Over.

21:25.855 --> 21:27.459
Shit, where are you?

21:42.674 --> 21:45.906
Throw the ball daddy, Throw it.

21:55.654 --> 21:56.015
Lucy.

22:01.990 --> 22:02.626
Lucy.

22:02.661 --> 22:03.022
Lucy.

22:05.730 --> 22:06.366
Lucy.

23:14.634 --> 23:15.061
Oh, shit.

26:05.035 --> 26:08.366
Did you want to hurt yourself?

26:08.401 --> 26:11.237
Every day.

26:11.272 --> 26:15.615
You blame yourself for
Lucy's death, the drowning?

26:19.379 --> 26:23.953
I think it's important that
we talk about Lucy and Mary.

26:26.892 --> 26:27.253
Why?

26:29.455 --> 26:34.293
Well James, to be
blunt, I'm wondering

26:34.328 --> 26:38.770
if their deaths are what
precipitated this leap into--

26:42.941 --> 26:45.271
Madness.

26:45.306 --> 26:48.912
I'd use the term disassociation.

26:48.947 --> 26:50.716
Oh, OK.

26:53.853 --> 26:59.120
Do you think these keepers,
these entities that you saw out

26:59.155 --> 27:03.157
there, could they just be a
manifestation of your guilt?

27:07.328 --> 27:08.327
What does the folder say?

27:17.305 --> 27:18.106
OK.

27:18.141 --> 27:19.910
All right.

27:19.945 --> 27:20.746
Right there.

27:28.954 --> 27:30.756
Stay right there Mrs Ableman.

27:45.168 --> 27:46.332
Protect the body.

27:49.535 --> 27:50.842
This is insane.

27:59.017 --> 28:02.183
OK, sure.

28:32.116 --> 28:33.016
Jesus Christ.

28:33.051 --> 28:36.019
Get it together Fisher.

28:36.054 --> 28:37.823
No.

28:37.858 --> 28:41.090
I saw you.

28:41.125 --> 28:41.893
You were moving.

30:21.489 --> 30:23.357
OK.

30:23.392 --> 30:24.589
You're shot.

30:24.624 --> 30:25.260
I'm shot.

30:30.498 --> 30:34.401
How about we just hang
in for a bit Mrs Ableman.

30:34.436 --> 30:35.336
What do you say?

30:46.316 --> 30:47.513
Hey, it's me.

30:47.548 --> 30:49.053
Before you come home
tonight, will you

30:49.088 --> 30:51.352
make sure to send that
check to Three Rivers?

30:51.387 --> 30:55.422
I just-- I really want to make
sure it gets there on time, OK?

30:55.457 --> 30:56.291
See you soon.

30:56.326 --> 30:56.896
I love you.

31:00.231 --> 31:12.208
So I told him one
thing at a time I suppose.

31:12.243 --> 31:15.340
I need to let him get his
head wrapped around it.

31:19.415 --> 31:21.921
Things haven't been
great since Lucy.

31:26.356 --> 31:28.224
Well, I know that.

31:28.259 --> 31:29.423
But try telling him.

31:33.660 --> 31:34.560
Trust me.

31:34.595 --> 31:36.232
It's not as easy as that.

31:36.267 --> 31:39.103
You can't snap your fingers
and make it go away.

31:43.736 --> 31:46.407
Yeah, he's out back, digging.

34:03.744 --> 34:05.183
What are you doing?

34:08.386 --> 34:10.089
Jesus, you scared me.

34:16.361 --> 34:17.129
Checking the time.

34:20.233 --> 34:23.861
In the decedents car?

34:23.896 --> 34:25.401
Yeah.

34:25.436 --> 34:27.865
Just use your phone.

34:27.900 --> 34:28.503
Right.

34:33.510 --> 34:36.181
Fisher?

34:36.216 --> 34:36.577
Uh huh?

34:40.484 --> 34:41.186
Where's the body?

34:47.425 --> 34:48.589
I moved it into the house.

34:53.200 --> 34:58.302
And is there a
reason you did that?

35:01.769 --> 35:03.274
Yes.

35:03.309 --> 35:05.276
Wait.

35:05.311 --> 35:06.211
Just.

35:06.246 --> 35:07.872
Look.

35:07.907 --> 35:10.578
Just.

35:10.613 --> 35:11.678
Wait, wait, wait, wait, look.

35:11.713 --> 35:15.286
Look, look, look.

35:15.321 --> 35:15.748
I found it.

35:19.523 --> 35:22.392
Uh huh.

35:22.427 --> 35:24.295
It was taped to this.

35:30.303 --> 35:30.664
OK.

35:34.670 --> 35:35.933
I found it in one of her books.

35:40.676 --> 35:41.840
One of whose books?

35:47.584 --> 35:50.420
Mrs Ableman's.

35:50.455 --> 35:50.816
I see.

35:54.690 --> 35:58.560
Listen Nancy Drew.

35:58.595 --> 36:00.628
I came here to let you
know the family's running

36:00.663 --> 36:02.795
a little bit behind schedule.

36:02.830 --> 36:05.435
OK.

36:05.470 --> 36:07.767
But I'm having serious
second thoughts about having

36:07.802 --> 36:09.208
you stay up here alone.

36:12.037 --> 36:12.469
Why?

36:16.349 --> 36:17.645
Call it intuition.

36:17.680 --> 36:20.615
Winters, look.

36:20.650 --> 36:23.948
I know how horsey this looks
but I promise you, I'm fine.

36:23.983 --> 36:25.554
OK?

36:25.589 --> 36:27.655
I'm fine.

36:27.690 --> 36:29.822
All right.

36:29.857 --> 36:31.659
Why haven't you been
answering your radio?

36:35.401 --> 36:38.369
My radio hasn't gone on.

36:38.404 --> 36:42.032
I've been calling you every
15 minutes for the past hour.

36:42.067 --> 36:43.539
You could have
saved me this trip.

36:43.574 --> 36:44.540
I don't know.

36:44.575 --> 36:44.969
It's on.

36:48.513 --> 36:49.545
Just make sure it's on.

36:49.580 --> 36:50.645
Yeah, of course.

36:57.390 --> 36:57.722
Shit.

36:57.757 --> 36:58.752
I forgot.

36:58.787 --> 37:01.524
I got you something.

37:01.559 --> 37:04.560
Got me something?

37:04.595 --> 37:07.497
Uh huh.

37:07.532 --> 37:09.598
I know I'm a few weeks late.

37:09.633 --> 37:12.865
I'm shit with this stuff.

37:12.900 --> 37:14.273
Happy birthday anyway.

37:17.674 --> 37:18.409
Here, take them.

37:22.613 --> 37:25.779
It's opera.

37:25.814 --> 37:29.717
Experiences are
the latest thing.

37:29.752 --> 37:33.721
I could have bought you a
desk lamp but it would break.

37:33.756 --> 37:36.724
Experiences stick with you.

37:36.759 --> 37:37.923
So the logic goes.

37:42.732 --> 37:46.932
There's a-- there's two of them.

37:46.967 --> 37:48.703
You know, I think I
figured out how you

37:48.738 --> 37:52.773
graduated top of the academy.

37:52.808 --> 37:54.841
Call a friend.

37:54.876 --> 37:58.383
Heard the term?

37:58.418 --> 37:59.648
No, it's good.

37:59.683 --> 38:00.616
It's good.

38:00.651 --> 38:02.783
I can do that.

38:02.818 --> 38:07.458
Listen, if you can't find
someone to throw with, call me.

38:07.493 --> 38:11.792
I could use a night out.

38:11.827 --> 38:15.631
Would it be OK with Brad?

38:15.666 --> 38:16.665
Fuck Brad.

38:21.573 --> 38:22.341
OK.

38:25.170 --> 38:28.512
Thanks Amy.

38:28.547 --> 38:33.385
Seriously, you deserve
to have a life.

38:33.420 --> 38:35.354
You've put it on pause
for long enough, yeah?

38:43.661 --> 38:45.958
Hey boss?

38:45.993 --> 38:47.993
Where's your car?

38:48.028 --> 38:51.865
I left it down by the road.

38:51.900 --> 38:55.506
Needed to stretch my legs, soak
up the sunshine while it lasts.

39:17.222 --> 39:18.562
Found your ball.

39:31.742 --> 39:33.038
Keep that radio on.

39:40.014 --> 39:42.850
Throw the ball daddy.

39:42.885 --> 39:45.853
Throw it.

39:45.888 --> 39:47.690
Did I lose you?

39:47.725 --> 39:49.021
Come on.

39:49.056 --> 39:51.661
We gotta get these planted.

39:51.696 --> 39:53.157
For Lucy.

39:53.192 --> 39:53.762
Dig.

40:47.917 --> 40:49.114
Keep digging.

41:06.804 --> 41:10.135
Let's get back to your
family for a brief moment.

41:10.170 --> 41:12.643
The police report said
you saw both Lucy and Mary

41:12.678 --> 41:13.809
out there that day.

41:13.844 --> 41:15.239
Yes.

41:15.274 --> 41:18.748
But you know that's
not possible.

41:18.783 --> 41:20.684
Yes.

41:20.719 --> 41:23.720
Can you explain how those
two statements can coexist?

41:23.755 --> 41:26.954
They make you see what
they want you to see.

41:26.989 --> 41:29.990
Are they here now?

41:30.025 --> 41:32.157
Not anymore.

41:32.192 --> 41:35.699
But they were before?

41:35.734 --> 41:37.096
They come and they go.

41:40.706 --> 41:41.903
I see.

41:41.938 --> 41:43.575
No you don't.

41:49.682 --> 41:50.175
But you will.

41:52.817 --> 41:54.146
Just like you asked.

43:52.970 --> 43:53.804
Shit.

44:28.038 --> 44:29.136
Hey partner.

44:29.171 --> 44:30.808
You out there?

44:30.843 --> 44:32.711
I could really use
someone to talk to.

44:35.881 --> 44:38.310
Sir, I told you to keep
this frequency clear.

44:38.345 --> 44:41.115
Over.

44:41.150 --> 44:42.116
OK, bud.

44:42.151 --> 44:43.282
Calm down.

44:43.317 --> 44:44.448
Look, if we're
going to be friends,

44:44.483 --> 44:45.988
can we skip the formalities?

44:46.023 --> 44:47.187
Maybe drop the overs?

44:53.030 --> 44:53.897
Who are you?

44:58.838 --> 44:59.804
Nobody really.

44:59.839 --> 45:01.201
A friend I guess.

45:05.570 --> 45:07.042
you OK friend?

45:07.077 --> 45:08.175
You sound kind of rattled.

45:13.116 --> 45:14.852
It's nothing.

45:14.887 --> 45:17.184
It's just a--

45:17.219 --> 45:21.353
I thought I saw something.

45:21.388 --> 45:23.894
Bad dream I guess.

45:23.929 --> 45:27.359
Yeah, but I've
been seeing things.

45:27.394 --> 45:30.527
I can't keep track of time.

45:33.202 --> 45:36.368
Something's happening
out here to me.

45:36.403 --> 45:38.876
I'm not there right now.

45:38.911 --> 45:42.407
OK, so I wasn't telling
you the full truth earlier.

45:45.247 --> 45:46.785
I'm out here
watching over a body.

45:50.054 --> 45:53.088
Protecting it.

45:53.123 --> 45:54.419
No, it's different.

45:54.454 --> 45:58.588
It's like-- OK, look, I
know this sounds insane,

45:58.623 --> 46:06.596
but thoughts in my head,
feelings, memories,

46:06.631 --> 46:08.972
they're becoming--

46:09.007 --> 46:09.808
God, I don't know.

46:13.979 --> 46:14.912
Yeah, OK.

46:18.610 --> 46:20.379
Yeah, that's
probably a good idea.

46:33.493 --> 46:35.966
You told the police you
were speaking with a Park

46:36.001 --> 46:36.868
Ranger on the radio.

46:41.171 --> 46:42.599
Yes.

46:42.634 --> 46:45.173
Did they tell you there wasn't
a park Ranger within 100

46:45.208 --> 46:47.109
miles of where you were?

46:47.144 --> 46:50.277
They would have been out
of range of radio signal.

46:50.312 --> 46:53.181
Yeah, they did.

46:53.216 --> 46:56.118
And do you believe them?

46:56.153 --> 46:57.152
Sure.

46:57.187 --> 46:57.889
Why not?

47:03.028 --> 47:07.261
So if that's the case,
who were you talking to?

47:29.252 --> 47:30.119
You there partner?

47:30.154 --> 47:30.614
Come back.

48:03.088 --> 48:04.648
Hey partner, I made
it back to the cabin.

48:04.683 --> 48:05.253
Come back.

48:11.195 --> 48:15.428
I can't talk right now James.

48:15.463 --> 48:16.231
Yeah, copy that.

48:16.266 --> 48:16.693
Over and out.

48:23.570 --> 48:24.635
Hey Winters, you out there?

48:24.670 --> 48:25.075
Come back.

49:19.659 --> 49:20.592
OK, come Mrs Ableman.

49:20.627 --> 49:24.233
Come on, up you go.

49:24.268 --> 49:25.432
OK.

49:25.467 --> 49:26.763
I got you.

49:26.798 --> 49:28.006
There we go.

49:41.351 --> 49:42.350
Oh, hell no.

50:17.453 --> 50:18.320
Witness.

50:18.355 --> 50:18.749
Come back.

50:18.784 --> 50:21.191
Over.

50:21.226 --> 50:25.360
Winters, come the fuck
back right fucking now.

50:25.395 --> 50:25.789
Over.

50:29.366 --> 50:29.727
OK.

50:32.732 --> 50:34.204
Hi.

50:34.239 --> 50:36.536
Did I lose you?

50:36.571 --> 50:39.539
We gotta get these
planted, for Lucy.

51:12.277 --> 51:14.706
No family, huh?

51:14.741 --> 51:17.577
No.

51:17.612 --> 51:19.546
Don't you hate
waiting on people?

51:22.485 --> 51:26.421
Can we-- can we go now?

51:26.456 --> 51:27.125
Not yet.

51:28.788 --> 51:31.426
Any idea how much longer?

51:31.461 --> 51:31.855
Soon.

51:35.927 --> 51:43.504
Winters, something's been
happening to me up here.

51:43.539 --> 51:45.737
How do you mean?

51:45.772 --> 51:48.245
I don't know exactly.

51:48.280 --> 51:53.580
Everything's been twisty
since you left this morning.

51:58.488 --> 52:02.721
Well, I'm sure it's just--

52:02.756 --> 52:04.624
something in the air.

52:09.829 --> 52:13.633
That thing gives me the creeps.

52:13.668 --> 52:14.304
Shit detail.

52:17.342 --> 52:21.575
What do you say you help
me move it out of here?

52:21.610 --> 52:24.479
What?

52:24.514 --> 52:26.448
Come on.

52:26.483 --> 52:28.648
Don't make me do this by myself.

52:28.683 --> 52:31.321
We're supposed to
be protecting it.

52:31.356 --> 52:33.521
You've done a bang up
job of that so far.

52:33.556 --> 52:34.753
Whoa, but you said--

52:34.788 --> 52:37.492
I say a lot of things.

52:37.527 --> 52:40.363
Come on.

52:40.398 --> 52:41.958
No.

52:41.993 --> 52:43.960
Seriously.

52:43.995 --> 52:45.665
Come on.

52:45.700 --> 52:47.370
I said no.

52:55.413 --> 52:58.546
She'll probably just
come back anyway.

52:58.581 --> 53:01.351
Her?

53:01.386 --> 53:02.385
The dead body?

53:05.852 --> 53:06.290
Yep.

53:12.331 --> 53:13.759
What are you doing?

53:13.794 --> 53:14.991
Would you dance with me?

53:18.568 --> 53:20.931
What?

53:20.966 --> 53:22.438
Please?

53:22.473 --> 53:24.374
It's been such a long
time since I've danced.

53:28.512 --> 53:30.644
I can't.

53:30.679 --> 53:31.711
You owe it to yourself.

53:40.755 --> 53:43.426
That's an order Deputy Fisher.

53:47.399 --> 53:47.760
Come on.

53:51.370 --> 53:51.731
Trust me.

54:47.723 --> 54:50.625
Jesus, Fisher.

54:50.660 --> 54:53.463
Holy shit.

54:53.498 --> 54:53.863
Let's go.

54:53.899 --> 54:55.058
Follow him.

54:55.093 --> 54:55.927
I'll cut him off around back.

54:55.962 --> 54:56.664
No, no, no, no, no.

54:56.699 --> 54:57.632
It's a bad idea.

54:57.667 --> 54:58.666
We need to stick together.

54:58.701 --> 54:59.502
What the hell's wrong with you?

54:59.537 --> 54:59.766
Just do your job.

55:02.771 --> 55:03.341
Oh, shit.

55:13.683 --> 55:15.617
Winters.

55:15.652 --> 55:18.015
James, you there?

55:18.050 --> 55:20.116
You need to get off
the line right now.

55:20.151 --> 55:23.020
No James, you need
to listen to me.

55:23.055 --> 55:25.759
You need to get off
this line immediately.

55:25.794 --> 55:27.090
Winters.

55:27.125 --> 55:28.927
She's not who she says she is.

55:31.569 --> 55:33.096
Excuse me?

55:33.131 --> 55:37.969
Your boss, she's lying to you.

55:38.004 --> 55:39.135
She's been lying to you.

55:41.876 --> 55:43.810
About what?

55:43.845 --> 55:44.976
She seem right to you?

55:45.011 --> 55:49.552
Is she acting normal?

55:53.789 --> 55:57.527
James, stop.

55:57.562 --> 55:59.760
Winters.

55:59.795 --> 56:03.126
Stop right now.

56:03.161 --> 56:04.127
It's a trap.

56:08.606 --> 56:09.572
Holt shit.

56:12.907 --> 56:14.874
Hey, calm down.

56:14.909 --> 56:15.677
Winters, it's Fisher.

56:15.712 --> 56:16.645
It's me.

56:16.680 --> 56:18.713
It's Fisher.

56:18.748 --> 56:20.847
Calm down.

56:20.882 --> 56:22.684
What the fuck happened to you?

56:22.719 --> 56:23.718
What the fuck happened?

56:23.753 --> 56:25.951
You fucking happened you freak.

56:25.986 --> 56:26.721
Shh.

56:26.756 --> 56:27.689
Okay. okay.

56:29.561 --> 56:31.759
What the hell
are you talking about?

56:31.794 --> 56:33.497
Okay, I'm gonna get you out.

56:42.607 --> 56:43.705
Wait, wait...

57:31.150 --> 57:32.655
What happened to
Sheriff Winters?

57:35.319 --> 57:36.560
She died.

57:39.565 --> 57:43.699
The autopsy says
the cause of death

57:43.734 --> 57:48.506
was due to penetrating
injuries to the abdomen.

57:51.610 --> 57:52.268
Did you do it?

57:55.306 --> 57:57.845
I was the only one out there.

57:57.880 --> 57:59.308
Right?

57:59.343 --> 58:02.586
I mean, that's what
you keep telling me.

58:05.349 --> 58:08.185
Did you have a
relationship with her?

58:08.957 --> 58:10.121
Nope.

58:12.323 --> 58:15.830
Did you want to have a
relationship with her?

58:15.865 --> 58:18.327
Come on, Doc.

58:18.362 --> 58:20.197
You got to do better than that.

59:41.379 --> 59:43.621
Why don't you shoot her James?

59:48.452 --> 59:50.793
I was you put them
in your pocket.

59:59.133 --> 1:00:01.265
I saw you dance with her.

1:00:03.335 --> 1:00:05.742
You never danced with me.

1:00:09.110 --> 1:00:11.748
Do you love her?

1:00:11.783 --> 1:00:13.783
Is she prettier than me?

1:00:14.313 --> 1:00:15.653
Stop.

1:00:17.921 --> 1:00:18.986
Stop.

1:00:19.351 --> 1:00:22.660
Am I so easy to forget?

1:00:23.960 --> 1:00:25.157
I'm sorry.

1:02:04.093 --> 1:02:04.520
Daddy?

1:02:14.433 --> 1:02:15.905
Why did you let me go?

1:02:21.440 --> 1:02:22.406
Why didn't you save me?

1:02:26.082 --> 1:02:30.414
I can't breathe.

1:02:30.449 --> 1:02:33.054
I can't breathe daddy.

1:02:33.089 --> 1:02:33.450
Baby.

1:02:39.293 --> 1:02:40.589
It's so dark here.

1:02:40.624 --> 1:02:41.023
I can't see you.

1:02:41.058 --> 1:02:42.899
Where are you?

1:02:42.934 --> 1:02:44.593
Why are you hiding?

1:02:44.628 --> 1:02:45.803
Where are you?

1:02:49.303 --> 1:02:52.271
You're not Lucy.

1:02:52.306 --> 1:02:53.976
This isn't real.

1:02:56.376 --> 1:02:58.475
Mommy's here.

1:02:58.510 --> 1:02:59.916
She wants to talk to you.

1:03:07.926 --> 1:03:08.287
Where?

1:03:11.457 --> 1:03:14.392
She won't stop coughing.

1:03:14.427 --> 1:03:17.593
I want to .

1:03:17.628 --> 1:03:18.836
Go that way.

1:03:36.614 --> 1:03:37.184
Lucy.

1:04:07.711 --> 1:04:12.219
I know you will
fuck me for sure.

1:04:12.254 --> 1:04:16.190
I see the way you watch me.

1:04:16.225 --> 1:04:17.059
Fuck you.

1:04:19.723 --> 1:04:20.898
You're not real.

1:06:00.164 --> 1:06:00.591
Fisher.

1:06:50.148 --> 1:06:50.509
Daddy?

1:06:56.880 --> 1:06:59.518
Lucy?

1:06:59.553 --> 1:07:00.519
It's so dark here.

1:07:05.163 --> 1:07:06.162
Lucy, wait.

1:07:14.403 --> 1:07:15.204
Why aren't you helping?

1:07:27.548 --> 1:07:29.416
Why didn't you save me?

1:07:29.451 --> 1:07:31.517
Lucy?

1:07:31.552 --> 1:07:32.518
Where are you?

1:09:00.773 --> 1:09:02.641
They're still out there.

1:09:02.676 --> 1:09:04.313
I'm not sure that's
a good idea partner.

1:09:09.848 --> 1:09:10.286
Yeah.

1:09:15.018 --> 1:09:17.953
I'm not so sure about
anything anymore.

1:09:17.988 --> 1:09:20.824
You have to confront this James.

1:09:20.859 --> 1:09:22.760
Who is the Park Ranger
you were speaking to?

1:09:26.865 --> 1:09:29.833
OK, let me see your pencil.

1:09:29.868 --> 1:09:31.571
Why?

1:09:31.606 --> 1:09:33.672
Because I'm going to stab
you in the neck with it.

1:09:36.545 --> 1:09:39.645
It's not funny James.

1:09:39.680 --> 1:09:41.350
I'm just kidding.

1:09:41.385 --> 1:09:43.649
Come on, let me see it.

1:09:43.684 --> 1:09:45.618
I can't do that.

1:09:45.653 --> 1:09:49.952
Let me see it.

1:10:00.338 --> 1:10:01.337
Paper too please.

1:10:09.072 --> 1:10:10.280
Thank you.

1:10:30.599 --> 1:10:31.400
What is that?

1:10:36.407 --> 1:10:39.672
That's the answer
to your question.

1:10:39.707 --> 1:10:41.542
Who I was talking to.

1:10:41.577 --> 1:10:44.677
Hey, do you see what he's
holding behind his back?

1:10:47.781 --> 1:10:48.747
There's nothing there.

1:10:52.687 --> 1:10:54.852
Sure there is.

1:10:54.887 --> 1:10:58.625
But you've got to
use your imagination.

1:10:58.660 --> 1:11:00.792
Just because you
can't see the knife

1:11:00.827 --> 1:11:02.860
doesn't mean it's not there.

1:12:08.158 --> 1:12:08.761
James.

1:12:11.733 --> 1:12:14.129
Hello?

1:12:14.164 --> 1:12:16.670
Jimmy.

1:12:16.705 --> 1:12:18.606
Hi.

1:12:18.641 --> 1:12:19.541
Did I lose you?

1:12:19.576 --> 1:12:21.136
Fucking finish it already.

1:12:56.877 --> 1:13:01.715
OK, OK, OK.

1:13:01.750 --> 1:13:02.683
OK Fisher.

1:13:02.718 --> 1:13:03.552
They're fucking with you.

1:13:03.587 --> 1:13:04.916
That's what they do.

1:13:10.726 --> 1:13:13.056
OK.

1:13:13.091 --> 1:13:14.563
Hey Winters, come back.

1:13:16.765 --> 1:13:17.665
Winters, it's Fisher.

1:13:17.700 --> 1:13:18.567
Come back.

1:13:29.074 --> 1:13:31.844
Why did you let me go?

1:13:31.879 --> 1:13:32.845
Why didn't you save me?

1:14:09.147 --> 1:14:10.245
Sheriff's Department.

1:14:10.280 --> 1:14:10.883
Open up.

1:14:14.823 --> 1:14:15.624
I know you're in there.

1:14:20.730 --> 1:14:21.289
Winters.

1:14:21.324 --> 1:14:21.689
Winters.

1:14:21.725 --> 1:14:22.664
No, no, no.

1:14:22.699 --> 1:14:23.258
It's me.

1:14:23.293 --> 1:14:23.962
Open your eyes.

1:14:23.997 --> 1:14:24.666
Look at me.

1:14:24.701 --> 1:14:25.832
Back off.

1:14:25.867 --> 1:14:26.668
No, no, no, they're
doing something.

1:14:26.703 --> 1:14:27.262
Back the fuck up.

1:14:27.297 --> 1:14:28.296
Listen to me.

1:14:28.331 --> 1:14:29.000
Put your hands behind your head.

1:14:29.035 --> 1:14:29.770
Look at me.

1:14:29.805 --> 1:14:30.133
Look at me.

1:14:30.168 --> 1:14:30.804
OK?

1:14:30.839 --> 1:14:32.069
Back up.

1:14:32.104 --> 1:14:32.773
They're doing something
something to you.

1:14:32.808 --> 1:14:33.807
I promise.

1:14:33.842 --> 1:14:34.203
Put your hands behind your head.

1:14:34.238 --> 1:14:35.578
OK.

1:14:35.613 --> 1:14:36.612
Winters, it's me.

1:14:36.647 --> 1:14:37.107
It's Fisher.

1:14:37.142 --> 1:14:38.779
OK?

1:14:38.814 --> 1:14:40.143
Sit.

1:14:40.178 --> 1:14:41.078
Amy.

1:14:41.113 --> 1:14:41.782
What did you call me?

1:14:41.817 --> 1:14:42.981
Sheriff.

1:14:43.016 --> 1:14:43.916
I'm telling you.

1:14:43.951 --> 1:14:45.148
They're doing something.

1:14:45.183 --> 1:14:48.217
You've got to-- you
have to listen, OK?

1:14:48.252 --> 1:14:49.592
Sit.

1:14:49.627 --> 1:14:49.922
Now.

1:14:49.957 --> 1:14:50.923
Hold on.

1:14:50.958 --> 1:14:51.825
I'm going.

1:14:51.860 --> 1:14:52.694
I'm going.

1:14:52.729 --> 1:14:54.223
Please, please, please.

1:14:54.258 --> 1:14:55.631
OK?

1:14:55.666 --> 1:14:57.963
I want you to put
the gun away, OK?

1:14:57.998 --> 1:14:59.635
Jesus Christ Amy.

1:14:59.670 --> 1:15:02.000
Take your fucking
finger off the trigger.

1:15:02.035 --> 1:15:02.836
Put that on.

1:15:02.871 --> 1:15:03.837
What?

1:15:03.872 --> 1:15:05.773
Now.

1:15:05.808 --> 1:15:07.302
OK.

1:15:07.337 --> 1:15:09.271
Hold on.

1:15:09.306 --> 1:15:09.876
Hold on.

1:15:12.848 --> 1:15:13.847
Amy.

1:15:13.882 --> 1:15:15.178
Why do you keep calling me that?

1:15:15.213 --> 1:15:19.149
Put the fucking gun away.

1:15:19.184 --> 1:15:20.689
What have you been
doing in here?

1:15:23.727 --> 1:15:24.319
Jesus Christ.

1:15:46.948 --> 1:15:49.817
All right.

1:15:49.852 --> 1:15:50.587
Start talking.

1:15:53.086 --> 1:15:54.184
Start talking about what?

1:15:57.255 --> 1:15:59.156
You're bad at this game.

1:16:02.227 --> 1:16:06.328
Was I not clear about the rules?

1:16:06.363 --> 1:16:12.037
Tell me, what happened with
our little friend over here?

1:16:20.179 --> 1:16:22.080
I don't know.

1:16:22.115 --> 1:16:23.279
Oh, come on.

1:16:27.252 --> 1:16:29.692
You can do better than
that you old snoop you.

1:16:34.094 --> 1:16:36.358
You did something.

1:16:40.298 --> 1:16:41.968
You finished what
she had started.

1:16:47.239 --> 1:16:49.107
I gave you one rule.

1:16:52.244 --> 1:16:55.443
Do you remember
what that rule was?

1:16:55.478 --> 1:16:57.951
Yeah.

1:16:57.986 --> 1:16:58.985
I remember the rule.

1:17:01.957 --> 1:17:02.318
Say it.

1:17:06.995 --> 1:17:07.829
Say it.

1:17:13.496 --> 1:17:16.200
Protect the body.

1:17:16.235 --> 1:17:17.135
And have you?

1:17:20.338 --> 1:17:22.107
She's still there isn't she?

1:17:37.322 --> 1:17:40.461
Everything has to be
just your way doesn't it?

1:17:44.329 --> 1:17:47.836
Everything in neat little rows.

1:17:52.370 --> 1:17:55.811
Did you exert your
authority over her, pervert?

1:18:09.387 --> 1:18:10.727
You want to know what I heard?

1:18:15.327 --> 1:18:17.228
I hear he killed his family.

1:18:22.367 --> 1:18:26.534
The whole lot of them.

1:18:26.569 --> 1:18:29.405
That's not true.

1:18:29.440 --> 1:18:30.879
Why would I lie about that?

1:18:34.049 --> 1:18:37.149
We have a 10-96 in progress
at Midland Heights.

1:18:37.184 --> 1:18:38.513
Over.

1:18:38.548 --> 1:18:40.449
This is Mobile Unit 1 dispatch.

1:18:40.484 --> 1:18:43.892
Copy that.

1:18:43.927 --> 1:18:44.926
Look at that.

1:18:51.264 --> 1:18:52.802
Saved by the bell.

1:19:10.415 --> 1:19:12.283
Guess we need to wrap this up.

1:19:14.958 --> 1:19:16.122
What are you doing?

1:19:16.157 --> 1:19:17.189
What are you doing.

1:19:17.224 --> 1:19:17.585
Stop.

1:19:17.620 --> 1:19:20.192
Stop.

1:19:20.227 --> 1:19:21.259
I know what you're doing.

1:19:24.330 --> 1:19:25.527
I know what you want me to do.

1:19:30.237 --> 1:19:30.939
Go ahead.

1:19:34.109 --> 1:19:36.571
Take her.

1:19:36.606 --> 1:19:39.244
Do you hear me?

1:19:39.279 --> 1:19:39.816
You can have her.

1:19:43.613 --> 1:19:44.282
I don't care.

1:19:48.222 --> 1:19:48.990
Take her.

1:20:00.201 --> 1:20:00.903
Oh, sweetie.

1:20:04.007 --> 1:20:04.874
They already did.

1:20:20.023 --> 1:20:20.956
Tell me who you are.

1:20:25.358 --> 1:20:26.192
An admirer.

1:20:30.330 --> 1:20:30.999
A coveter.

1:20:35.467 --> 1:20:37.038
I don't understand.

1:20:42.474 --> 1:20:44.045
You finished what I started.

1:20:47.083 --> 1:20:49.545
I've wanted nothing
more than to gaze

1:20:49.580 --> 1:20:55.551
upon them, to bask in their
all consuming darkness.

1:20:58.391 --> 1:20:59.962
It's been my life's work.

1:21:03.396 --> 1:21:07.629
But your aura, it's so shadow.

1:21:11.041 --> 1:21:13.305
The deepest black
I've ever seen.

1:21:21.117 --> 1:21:29.057
All this work, a lifetime,
they still want you.

1:21:36.396 --> 1:21:39.694
This is your fault.

1:21:39.729 --> 1:21:43.170
That would be easy, wouldn't it?

1:21:43.205 --> 1:21:45.271
So clean.

1:21:45.306 --> 1:21:45.942
But no.

1:21:59.353 --> 1:22:00.550
Keep digging.

1:22:17.503 --> 1:22:18.975
What time is it?

1:22:29.581 --> 1:22:31.119
Did I fall asleep?

1:22:38.359 --> 1:22:40.458
What were we talking about?

1:22:45.366 --> 1:22:46.398
I remember.

1:22:58.478 --> 1:23:00.148
Out baby's name.

1:23:04.748 --> 1:23:07.452
I always liked the name Lucy.

1:23:18.168 --> 1:23:19.200
It won't be long now.

1:23:21.666 --> 1:23:23.501
Just the three of us.

1:24:05.248 --> 1:24:06.148
What's the matter James?

1:24:10.418 --> 1:24:11.252
Aren't you happy?

1:24:20.263 --> 1:24:21.196
Don't be afraid.

1:24:55.529 --> 1:24:56.726
Keep digging.

1:26:09.702 --> 1:26:11.273
Hey there partner.

1:26:13.035 --> 1:26:15.343
When's the last time you ate?

1:26:15.642 --> 1:26:18.379
You look horrible.

1:26:18.414 --> 1:26:20.480
You've got to keep
your strength up James.

1:26:20.515 --> 1:26:22.812
There's work to be done.

1:26:23.518 --> 1:26:25.320
Not hungry.

1:26:33.660 --> 1:26:36.892
I didn't do those things.

1:26:37.367 --> 1:26:38.960
I didn't kill them.

1:26:42.064 --> 1:26:46.000
Like you want me
to believe I did.

1:26:46.035 --> 1:26:49.036
You've got to watch
Lucy a little closer.

1:26:49.071 --> 1:26:52.039
Mary thought you were
watching her didn't she?

1:26:52.074 --> 1:26:55.515
You said you were
always watching.

1:26:55.550 --> 1:26:59.684
I hear her screaming out
for you all the time.

1:26:59.719 --> 1:27:01.983
Begging for you to make it stop.

1:27:02.018 --> 1:27:04.425
Can you do that for her James?

1:27:04.460 --> 1:27:05.921
Can you make it stop?

1:27:08.860 --> 1:27:13.027
I never asked for any of this.

1:27:13.062 --> 1:27:16.569
You have to confront this James.

1:27:16.604 --> 1:27:18.769
No.

1:27:18.804 --> 1:27:20.276
I was following orders.

1:27:23.105 --> 1:27:25.578
Protect the body.

1:27:25.613 --> 1:27:26.909
What happened to
Sheriff Winters?

1:27:29.815 --> 1:27:30.913
I broke the rule.

1:27:30.948 --> 1:27:32.717
When you touched
the deceased hand,

1:27:32.752 --> 1:27:36.919
is that when they took control?

1:27:36.954 --> 1:27:40.054
So I never had control.

1:27:40.089 --> 1:27:41.858
Then even.

1:27:41.893 --> 1:27:43.365
Tell me, did you love her?

1:27:45.930 --> 1:27:48.766
Do you think she knew it?

1:27:48.801 --> 1:27:52.374
Did you tell her
enough while you could?

1:27:52.409 --> 1:27:54.937
I'm not so sure.

1:27:54.972 --> 1:27:56.906
She's here with me you know?

1:27:56.941 --> 1:27:59.744
Here in the dark.

1:27:59.779 --> 1:28:02.615
Lucy too.

1:28:02.650 --> 1:28:05.750
You want to know a secret?

1:28:05.785 --> 1:28:10.590
She actually thinks
you can save her.

1:28:10.625 --> 1:28:13.560
Break time's almost over.

1:28:13.595 --> 1:28:14.792
Eat up.

1:28:14.827 --> 1:28:17.729
then let's get back to it, huh?

1:29:04.679 --> 1:29:06.041
Good bye James.

1:29:36.843 --> 1:29:37.413
James.

1:31:04.997 --> 1:31:07.129
This is it my friend.

1:31:07.164 --> 1:31:10.264
This is where we part ways.

1:31:10.299 --> 1:31:12.266
Don't worry.

1:31:12.301 --> 1:31:15.071
There's nothing left to say.

1:31:15.106 --> 1:31:16.644
But I hear you anyway.

1:31:16.679 --> 1:31:18.272
I've always heard you.

1:31:41.836 --> 1:31:43.836
Yeah.

1:31:43.871 --> 1:31:45.541
Yes, you--

1:31:48.205 --> 1:31:50.139
Can
we meet in the dark?

1:31:50.174 --> 1:31:54.242
We don't have to say much.

1:31:54.277 --> 1:31:58.015
If you have to go, have to go.

1:32:02.318 --> 1:32:04.692
If we didn't know what we know.

1:32:10.733 --> 1:32:15.164
It's the end of the world
at the palm of my hand.

1:32:19.401 --> 1:32:23.007
When it all goes to Hell
will you still be my friend?

1:32:28.784 --> 1:32:32.214
My my face to the sea,
my back's to the land.

1:32:36.792 --> 1:32:41.157
If you can't come with
me, I'll understand.

1:32:45.130 --> 1:32:47.064
Can we Meet in the dark?

1:32:47.099 --> 1:32:49.099
We don't have to say much.

1:32:53.677 --> 1:32:55.710
And if you have
to go, have to go.

1:33:02.246 --> 1:33:04.620
I'll let you go, let you go.

1:33:08.054 --> 1:33:10.021
I'll let you go, let you go.

1:33:12.993 --> 1:33:15.631
If we didn't know what we know.

1:33:20.000 --> 1:33:27.676
Cause when you travel light,
some things are left behind.

1:33:36.852 --> 1:33:39.050
It's the end of the world
at the palm of my hand.

1:33:44.992 --> 1:33:50.127
When it all goes to Hell
will you still be my friend?

1:33:55.167 --> 1:33:58.399
My face to the sea,
my back to the land.

1:34:03.340 --> 1:34:06.847
If you can't come with
me I'll understand.

1:34:14.450 --> 1:34:17.957
Well, this is it for us James.

1:34:17.992 --> 1:34:19.453
Did you get what you needed?

1:34:19.488 --> 1:34:22.126
Enough.

1:34:22.161 --> 1:34:23.259
I truly wish you the best.

1:34:26.968 --> 1:34:28.264
That's so kind of you.

1:34:57.031 --> 1:34:58.195
Did you drop something?

1:35:04.434 --> 1:35:07.743
Mr Fisher, I need that back.
