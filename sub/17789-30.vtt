<font color="#fff00">Corrected & Synced by Bakugan</font>

00:14.181 --> 00:15.547
And the
interconnecting strands

00:15.549 --> 00:16.949
won't lose
their elasticity.

00:16.951 --> 00:18.951
And that's how you make
a homemade hairnet.

00:18.953 --> 00:20.519
Yeah, that's great, Dad.

00:20.521 --> 00:22.554
But what we asked was, "Why are
you wearing that helmet?"

00:22.556 --> 00:24.156
Oh, sorry,
I can't hear you that well.

00:24.158 --> 00:26.625
I'm wearing a helmet.
You're probably wondering why.

00:26.627 --> 00:28.727
You see, your mother
sent me to buy myself some

00:28.729 --> 00:31.430
exercise equipment, and I was
going to get an exercise bike,

00:31.432 --> 00:33.265
but I thought I'd need
a helmet first.

00:33.267 --> 00:34.933
For an exercise bike?

00:34.935 --> 00:36.702
No, for the exercise bike.

00:36.704 --> 00:38.404
I tried this one on,
and guess what?

00:38.406 --> 00:40.672
It was too small and you
couldn't take it off, so you had

00:40.674 --> 00:42.808
to buy it, or they wouldn't
let you leave the store?

00:42.810 --> 00:45.144
No. It was too small
so I couldn't take it off,

00:45.146 --> 00:48.380
and I had to buy it, or they
wouldn't let me leave the store.

00:48.382 --> 00:49.948
Huh?

00:51.185 --> 00:52.551
Ah!
What are you doing there?

00:52.553 --> 00:54.453
Sorry, that was getting
really annoying.

00:54.455 --> 00:56.355
Hmm.
So I can't hear very well,

00:56.357 --> 00:58.857
and I have extremely
limited peripheral vision.

00:58.859 --> 01:01.093
Do you kids want to hop in
the car and go for a drive?

01:01.095 --> 01:02.494
Absolutely not.

01:02.496 --> 01:04.430
Great!
Let's go grab some lunch!

01:05.933 --> 01:07.199
Mind the Steps!

01:07.201 --> 01:09.034
Shouldn't we do
something about that?

01:09.036 --> 01:11.036
And the trash!

01:11.038 --> 01:13.906
Hmm, you're right.

01:13.908 --> 01:16.775
There.
Now we can hear the TV again.

01:16.777 --> 01:18.577
Hmm.
It's so quiet today.

01:18.579 --> 01:20.379
Hardly any traffic on the roads.

01:21.949 --> 01:23.882
Shame about all
these potholes, though.

01:23.884 --> 01:28.720
A parking spot right
outside Joyful Burger!

01:32.827 --> 01:35.427
You kids wait here.
I'll get lunch.

01:35.429 --> 01:37.429
For the last time, Bill,

01:37.431 --> 01:39.631
this is a bank
not a dating agency.

01:39.633 --> 01:41.400
Oh.

01:44.738 --> 01:46.705
Oh, my gosh,
this is really happening!

01:47.775 --> 01:49.441
Remember what they
told us, Larry...

01:49.443 --> 01:51.844
Employees can be replaced,
money can't!

01:52.913 --> 01:54.279
Oh, forget the training!

01:54.281 --> 01:56.081
We're being robbed!
We're being Robbed!

01:57.551 --> 01:59.751
Hmm.
Must be someone's birthday.

01:59.753 --> 02:03.856
Everybody throw
your hands in the air!

02:03.858 --> 02:07.025
Okay.
You have a choice to make.

02:07.027 --> 02:10.395
Ah, heck, let's just make this
easy on both of us.

02:10.396 --> 02:11.830
I'll take everything
you've got.

02:11.832 --> 02:13.532
Uh, how do
you want that, sir?

02:13.534 --> 02:15.634
Uh, just in the normal
brown bags is fine.

02:15.636 --> 02:18.437
Don't be a hero, Larry!
I'm not being a hero!

02:18.439 --> 02:20.839
Just give him what he wants,
Larry, don't be hero!

02:20.841 --> 02:22.040
I'm not!

02:24.000 --> 02:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:38.058 --> 02:40.392
Okay, sir,
that's everything.

02:40.394 --> 02:42.461
Pleasure doing business
with you, gentlemen.

02:42.463 --> 02:44.463
Don't do it, Larry!
Don't press the alarm!

02:44.465 --> 02:45.964
Don't be a hero!

02:45.966 --> 02:48.333
What is your problem!?
What do you think you're doing?!

02:48.335 --> 02:50.602
Oh, yeah, that reminds me.

02:50.604 --> 02:52.538
We need to settle up.

02:52.540 --> 02:54.139
No, no, no!
Please don't!

02:54.141 --> 02:55.807
Okay!

03:00.381 --> 03:02.581
What a great day.

03:02.583 --> 03:04.816
We got a free lunch,
roads are all quiet.

03:04.818 --> 03:07.119
Even you two are behaving
yourselves.

03:07.121 --> 03:09.388
So even though Larry is
screaming like a baby,

03:09.390 --> 03:11.056
I managed to keep a cool head.

03:11.058 --> 03:12.958
I said to the robber, "If you're
going to hurt these citizens,

03:12.960 --> 03:15.027
you're going to have
to come through me first."

03:15.029 --> 03:16.528
Wow, so brave.

03:16.530 --> 03:19.565
I'm gonna make sure the mayor
gives you a medal for this.

03:19.567 --> 03:21.099
Uh, that's not actually
what hap...

03:21.101 --> 03:23.302
Hey, we're gonna get to your
cowardly ramblings in a second.

03:23.304 --> 03:25.037
Don't let this man
bother you, sir.

03:25.039 --> 03:26.738
Please, continue.

03:26.740 --> 03:29.608
Then Larry handed over all
the money and the guy ran off.

03:29.610 --> 03:33.312
If you ask me, Larry was
a bit <i>too</i> cooperative.

03:33.314 --> 03:36.248
So you think this was
an inside job?

03:36.250 --> 03:38.417
Ah, what do I know?
I'm just a hero.

03:38.419 --> 03:41.320
I've heard enough.
Arrest this man!

03:41.322 --> 03:42.588
Case closed!

03:42.590 --> 03:44.456
Uh, Chief, we don't
have the money.

03:44.458 --> 03:46.058
Or the man who took it.

03:46.060 --> 03:48.360
I'm reopening the case.

03:48.362 --> 03:51.597
Okay, boys, I want roadblocks
here, here, and here.

03:51.599 --> 03:53.832
You do realize
that's a map of Paris.

03:53.834 --> 03:56.101
Like I said, we think he's gonna
skip the country,

03:56.103 --> 03:57.336
most likely to Paris.

03:57.338 --> 03:58.904
Beautiful city, Chief...
City of Love.

03:58.906 --> 04:00.939
Why aren't you out there
catching this guy?!

04:00.941 --> 04:04.576
Sir, please, don't make us give
you another full body search.

04:04.578 --> 04:06.912
Uh, Chief?
Take a look at the TV.

04:08.382 --> 04:11.016
If its that video of the owl
riding the llama, I've seen it.

04:11.018 --> 04:12.317
No, that.

04:12.319 --> 04:13.719
<i>And now a breaking story.</i>

04:13.721 --> 04:15.254
<i>A bank robber
is making his getaway.</i>

04:15.256 --> 04:17.822
Normally, we would call it
a high-speed police chase,

04:17.825 --> 04:20.192
but the police haven't really
started following him yet.

04:20.194 --> 04:22.561
So at the moment, it's more
of a leisurely drive.

04:22.563 --> 04:24.496
Can you guys believe
what's on TV?

04:24.498 --> 04:27.232
I know!
That owl is riding a llama!

04:27.234 --> 04:28.767
What a time
to be alive.

04:28.769 --> 04:31.136
No, you butt-clowns.
On Channel 6.

04:31.138 --> 04:32.971
Cool! Cool!

04:32.973 --> 04:35.440
Oh, I love these things!
Sometimes they get out and run.

04:35.442 --> 04:37.342
It's like, "Dude,
what are you doing?!"

04:37.344 --> 04:38.543
You're in a car!

04:38.545 --> 04:39.911
That's our car!

04:39.913 --> 04:41.880
The bank robber
must have stolen it!

04:41.882 --> 04:43.482
Oh, I hope
Richard's okay!

04:43.484 --> 04:45.651
Uh, Mom,
that's Dad driving it.

04:45.653 --> 04:47.052
I'll kill him!

04:47.054 --> 04:49.354
Yes, sir, no one
is gonna get through

04:49.356 --> 04:50.789
a roadblock like this.

04:50.791 --> 04:53.425
Why not build
the actual roadblock?!

04:53.427 --> 04:54.893
What would be the point
in spending

04:54.895 --> 04:56.795
all that taxpayer money
building the model

04:56.797 --> 04:58.430
if we're not
even going to use it?

04:58.432 --> 05:00.165
Then I'm not going
to pay my taxes.

05:00.167 --> 05:01.533
Really?
Boys!

05:03.170 --> 05:05.404
To give the illusion
of varied coverage,

05:05.406 --> 05:06.905
let's go to our man
in the street

05:06.907 --> 05:08.940
and get his eyewitness report.
Mike?

05:08.942 --> 05:12.311
Well, I'm at ground level, so I
can't really see anything.

05:12.313 --> 05:14.179
Uh, back to the chopper.

05:16.450 --> 05:18.550
And we've lost him.

05:25.826 --> 05:27.793
You'll never believe
what happened!

05:27.795 --> 05:29.394
I got us a free lunch!

05:29.396 --> 05:31.596
No, Richard,
you robbed a bank!

05:31.598 --> 05:33.332
Mom, he can't hear
with that thing on.

05:34.902 --> 05:37.769
It's all over the news!
It's on every channel!

05:37.771 --> 05:40.205
Really, for free burgers?
Slow news day.

05:40.207 --> 05:42.674
Richard, you didn't go
to Joyful Burger.

05:42.676 --> 05:45.444
You went to the bank,
and you stole $2 million.

05:48.782 --> 05:51.283
Oh, my gosh!

05:51.285 --> 05:53.285
We have no lunch!

05:54.755 --> 05:57.456
We gotta return that money.

05:57.458 --> 05:59.958
But we're gonna need
to be clever about it.

06:02.296 --> 06:03.829
Taxi!

06:03.831 --> 06:05.764
Why didn't we use
a suitcase like that?

06:05.766 --> 06:07.132
This is all we had.

06:07.134 --> 06:08.934
Besides, I don't want
to give away a nice one.

06:08.936 --> 06:11.436
Richard, just go!

06:11.438 --> 06:13.405
Ah.
One thing.

06:13.407 --> 06:14.806
Good luck.

06:14.808 --> 06:16.475
It feels good
to do the right thing, Mom.

06:16.477 --> 06:18.844
I mean sure, that $2 million
could have paid off the house,

06:18.846 --> 06:21.213
our debt, and let you take
an early retirement, but...

06:21.215 --> 06:22.581
Somebody, stop him!

06:22.583 --> 06:25.484
Bring him down, bring him down!
Stop that man!

06:26.820 --> 06:29.788
- Oh, hi, Mr. Watterson!
- Hi.

06:29.790 --> 06:31.723
I mean, hi.

06:33.560 --> 06:35.227
Say, I'd love
to stay and chat,

06:35.229 --> 06:37.462
but we're on the trail
of a bank robber.

06:37.464 --> 06:39.431
Oh, yeah.
I heard about that, ha.

06:39.433 --> 06:40.899
Maybe it was an accident?

06:40.901 --> 06:43.034
Accidental bank robbery?
That actually carries

06:43.036 --> 06:45.203
a higher jail time than
regular bank robberies.

06:45.205 --> 06:47.305
Hey, Earl, what we looking at
for accidental?

06:47.307 --> 06:49.007
Life... at least.
And that's too good

06:49.009 --> 06:50.942
for 'em, if you ask me!
Am I right, fellas?!

06:50.944 --> 06:52.411
- Yeah, yeah, you're right!
- The worst!

06:52.413 --> 06:54.279
- I know, right?
- Don't even get me started!

06:54.281 --> 06:57.282
Anyway, what brings you here?

06:59.153 --> 07:00.552
We need another plan.

07:00.554 --> 07:03.321
Uh, excuse me.
So sorry to interrupt.

07:03.323 --> 07:05.090
Uh, you forgot your...

07:05.092 --> 07:08.226
Here you go.

07:08.228 --> 07:10.662
Okay, well, uh...

07:10.664 --> 07:12.697
enjoy your alleyway.

07:14.067 --> 07:16.868
All right, here's the plan.
We do a heist.

07:16.870 --> 07:19.538
- Huh?!
- But in reverse.

07:19.540 --> 07:21.306
It's a normal day at the bank,

07:21.308 --> 07:24.209
and a mailman brings
a mysterious package.

07:24.211 --> 07:26.411
He takes it to an unsuspecting
Larry at the counter,

07:26.413 --> 07:28.647
who signs for it and reads
instructions telling him

07:28.649 --> 07:30.315
not to open it until
Christmas.

07:30.317 --> 07:33.118
Naturally, Larry would want
to keep the box safe.

07:33.120 --> 07:35.387
And where is safer
than the bank's vault?

07:35.389 --> 07:37.823
At the end of the day,
when everyone has left,

07:37.825 --> 07:39.825
I make my move.

07:41.628 --> 07:43.628
I make my way to
the safety deposit boxes,

07:43.630 --> 07:46.998
avoiding the high-tech state-
of-the-art security system.

07:48.735 --> 07:51.603
All I have to do is put
the money back.

07:51.605 --> 07:53.371
I put the money back...

07:53.373 --> 07:54.606
Really?

07:54.608 --> 07:56.942
I put the money back...

07:56.944 --> 07:58.643
in our account.
We purchase first-class

07:58.645 --> 08:00.879
one-way tickets to Martinique
and spend the rest of our lives

08:00.881 --> 08:02.481
living in sunshine
and total luxury!

08:02.483 --> 08:03.682
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!

08:03.684 --> 08:05.016
Should have seen
that coming.

08:05.018 --> 08:07.085
Ooh, ooh!
I've got one!

08:07.087 --> 08:10.121
It's the dead of night,
and I've got the cash.

08:10.123 --> 08:13.625
I go to an ATM, but instead
of taking money out,

08:13.627 --> 08:15.994
I put the money in.

08:20.133 --> 08:22.834
Hold your horses,
bucky-o.

08:22.836 --> 08:25.971
I've been eyeballing you
cramming that there money box

08:25.973 --> 08:28.406
full of Benjamins for
the last three days.

08:28.408 --> 08:30.575
It's a first-class ticket
to the birdhouse for you.

08:30.577 --> 08:31.776
Kapoosh?

08:31.778 --> 08:33.745
- Birdhouse?
- Bucky-o?

08:33.746 --> 08:35.046
Kapoosh?!

08:35.048 --> 08:36.448
What?
That's how cops talk!

08:36.450 --> 08:37.883
No one speaks like that

08:37.885 --> 08:40.118
in this or any other branch
of reality, kapoosh?

08:40.120 --> 08:42.120
Agh!
Okay, here's what we do.

08:42.121 --> 08:44.489
We put the money back
from inside.

08:44.491 --> 08:47.859
You see, the bank accepts
one internship every year.

08:47.861 --> 08:49.995
I study to take
the financial services exam

08:49.997 --> 08:51.663
and pass
with distinction.

08:51.665 --> 08:52.964
Working weekends

08:52.966 --> 08:54.866
and taking every hour
of overtime available,

08:54.868 --> 08:57.068
I work my way up from
intern to assistant manager,

08:57.070 --> 08:58.770
assistant manager
to manager,

08:58.772 --> 09:00.772
and from manager
to regional manager.

09:00.774 --> 09:02.741
All I need to do then
is deposit a dollar a day

09:02.743 --> 09:04.042
into the bank's central account

09:04.044 --> 09:06.011
as an aggregated
transactional fee every day,

09:06.013 --> 09:07.279
thus returning the money.

09:07.281 --> 09:09.481
One single dollar
every single day.

09:09.483 --> 09:11.249
Practically undetectable.

09:11.251 --> 09:13.952
Wait, giving back
$2 million one day at a time?

09:13.954 --> 09:17.622
Wouldn't you have to work there
for like...

09:17.624 --> 09:20.158
two m-mi-million days?

09:20.160 --> 09:23.161
Oh, yeah.

09:23.163 --> 09:25.163
No, wait...
I've got it!

09:25.165 --> 09:26.998
Just before
the police catch me,

09:27.000 --> 09:29.534
I manage to bury the money
somewhere no one will find it.

09:29.536 --> 09:32.604
And so I know where it is,
I leave myself a subtle clue.

09:32.606 --> 09:34.439
After being apprehended,
I'm sentenced

09:34.441 --> 09:36.808
to 20 years in
the state penitentiary.

09:36.810 --> 09:38.310
But I have a plan!

09:38.312 --> 09:40.378
I'm going to tunnel
my way out.

09:40.380 --> 09:43.915
Unfortunately, all they had in
the canteen was plastic forks.

09:43.917 --> 09:46.851
It took me 20 years,
but I was out.

09:55.362 --> 09:58.863
Then all I have to do
is collect the money.

09:58.865 --> 10:00.932
What the...

10:05.439 --> 10:08.006
Hey?
What's going on?!

10:08.008 --> 10:10.909
Oh, Richard darling!
Mwah! Mwah!

10:10.911 --> 10:12.277
How lovely to see you.

10:12.279 --> 10:13.878
Did you spend
all the money?

10:13.880 --> 10:15.947
Well, it seemed rather
a shame not to.

10:15.949 --> 10:18.116
Yes, Papa, it wasn't even
earning interest.

10:18.118 --> 10:19.784
Wait, how did you know
where I hid it?

10:19.786 --> 10:21.386
We're watching
your flash-forward.

10:21.388 --> 10:23.254
Oh, come on!
That doesn't seem fair!

10:23.256 --> 10:25.757
You did rob a bank.
Hmph!

10:25.759 --> 10:28.226
Darwin,
do you have an idea?

10:28.228 --> 10:29.628
Darwin?

10:29.630 --> 10:31.096
I did it!

10:31.098 --> 10:32.964
I just dropped the money
back in the bank.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.332
Problem solved!

10:34.334 --> 10:36.501
We did it!
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

10:36.503 --> 10:38.870
Uh, you guys are gonna
have to clear the area.

10:38.872 --> 10:41.106
We just found a suspicious
package in the bank!

10:41.108 --> 10:43.875
But don't worry, we're going
to do a controlled explosion!

10:47.047 --> 10:48.847
Well, we tried.

10:48.853 --> 10:50.853
