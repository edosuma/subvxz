DRAGON: /In a land of myth
and a time of magic,

00:05.173 --> 00:09.969
the destiny of a great kingdom

00:10.344 --> 00:13.431
His name, Merlin.

00:33.117 --> 00:37.580

00:45.338 --> 00:47.965
(CHANTING) Uther Pendragon!

00:59.644 --> 01:02.897
UTHER: Do you solemnly swear,
to govern the people of this kingdom

01:02.980 --> 01:06.150
and its dominions,
according to the statutes,

01:06.234 --> 01:09.654
customs and laws,
laid down by your forebears?

01:09.737 --> 01:13.699
- I do, Sire.
-Do you promise to exercise mercy

01:14.200 --> 01:17.828
and justice
in your deeds and judgments?

01:17.954 --> 01:22.124
- I do, Sire.
-Do you swear allegiance to Camelot,

01:22.208 --> 01:24.961
now, and for as long
as you shall live?

01:26.170 --> 01:29.006
I, Arthur Pendragon,

01:29.090 --> 01:32.635
do pledge life and limb
to your service

01:32.718 --> 01:35.346

Now, being of age
and heir apparent,

you shall be Crown Prince of Camelot.

01:49.443 --> 01:50.444
(APPLAUDING)

02:01.330 --> 02:04.542
So how does it feel to be
servant to the Crown Prince of Camelot?

02:04.625 --> 02:07.044
Washing his royal socks
will be even more of a privilege.

02:07.128 --> 02:09.714
You're proud of him, even though you
complain about him constantly.

02:09.797 --> 02:12.341
-I am not.
-You are. I can see it in your face.

02:12.425 --> 02:14.635
Those socks are very clean.
Of course I'm proud of them.

03:21.035 --> 03:24.497
Single combat. Noon tomorrow.
Till the death.

04:19.385 --> 04:21.803
Have you ever seen
this Black Knight before?

04:21.887 --> 04:24.890
- I don't believe so.
-You didn't recognize his crest?

04:24.974 --> 04:27.143
-Crest?
-Which house is it?

04:27.226 --> 04:28.811
I'm not sure.
| didn't see it that clearly.

04:28.894 --> 04:31.188
He's not someone
you'd forget in a hurry, is he?

04:31.772 --> 04:34.191
No.

04:35.734 --> 04:37.236
So you don't think
he's from around here?

04:38.112 --> 04:40.406
-That would seem likely.
-Then what's he doing here?

04:40.489 --> 04:42.616
Your faith in my
all-seeing knowledge

04:42.700 --> 04:44.493
is both touching
and wholly misplaced.

04:44.577 --> 04:46.495
Maybe if you've
finished your work, you could go to bed

04:46.579 --> 04:48.289
and leave me to finish mine.

04:48.372 --> 04:50.583
Okay, I'm going.

04:53.169 --> 04:56.464
-Gaius?
-Merlin.

04:56.547 --> 04:58.674
Do you think
Owain can beat him?

05:01.510 --> 05:03.762
We will find out soon enough.

05:11.896 --> 05:14.023
He shouldn't have picked up
the gauntlet!

05:14.106 --> 05:16.192
So put an end to it.

05:16.275 --> 05:18.861
The challenge has been taken up,
the fight cannot be stopped.

05:18.944 --> 05:20.905
-Then fight in his place.
-I can't!

05:20.988 --> 05:24.700
-Why not?
-Owain picked up the gauntlet,

05:24.783 --> 05:27.578
Owain is the one who must fight.
That's the Knight's Code.

05:28.954 --> 05:32.124
-He knew that.
-But it's a fight to the death.

-The Black Knight.
-So it is he?

05:47.139 --> 05:49.433
-You saw his crest?
-Have you confirmed it?

05:49.517 --> 05:51.602
It is the crest
of Tristan de Bois.

05:51.685 --> 05:55.064
And he's the only Knight
ever to have carried such a crest?

05:55.147 --> 05:57.233
Yes, according to the records.

-What is it?
-The Knight, the stranger,

06:20.714 --> 06:24.552
he bears the crest
of Tristan de Bois.

06:24.635 --> 06:26.136
Yes.

-Dead men do not return.

06:58.127 --> 07:01.171
You've never fought in
mortal combat before, it's different.

07:01.255 --> 07:02.631
It's not like the training
I've been giving you.

07:02.715 --> 07:05.551
-Yeah, I know.
-Listen to me.

07:05.926 --> 07:08.304
The problem is,
we've never seen him fight.

07:08.387 --> 07:10.556
You have to quickly get
the measure of him.

07:10.639 --> 07:15.269
But I have the same advantage.
He's never seen me fight.

07:15.352 --> 07:17.438
-True.
-You've watched me.

07:17.521 --> 07:19.023
-Yes.
-And?

07:22.109 --> 07:24.111
And I know no one braver.

07:26.780 --> 07:31.493
Remember, all it takes to kill a
man is one well-aimed blow.

07:38.375 --> 07:41.712

to give you this token.

07:42.755 --> 07:44.715
She wishes you to
wear it for luck.

07:46.091 --> 07:50.054
You can thank her and tell her
| shall wear it with pride,

07:51.680 --> 07:52.973

find the flow of the fight

08:21.460 --> 08:23.003
and try to control it.

08:34.222 --> 08:37.476
The fight shall be
to the Knights' rules

08:37.558 --> 08:38.936

10:44.394 --> 10:47.064
I, Sir Pellinor,
take up the challenge.

10:49.024 --> 10:50.275
So be it.

11:08.836 --> 11:10.420
Should we tend to his wounds?

11:11.338 --> 11:13.632
-He took a hit.
-Owain didn't land a blow.

11:13.715 --> 11:15.676
No, I saw it.
The sword definitely pierced him.

11:15.759 --> 11:18.262
-Are you sure?
-My eyes are quicker than yours.

11:19.513 --> 11:21.181
He should be dead.

11:21.974 --> 11:23.559
Perhaps he already is.

ARTHUR: (ANGRILY) Why'd you stop me?

11:28.438 --> 11:30.065
We have to give our Knights a
chance to prove themselves.

11:30.148 --> 11:31.567
Have you seen
how this stranger fights?

11:31.650 --> 11:33.527
And Sir Pellinor is more
than a match for him.

11:33.610 --> 11:36.613
He's not recovered from the
wounds he suffered at Othanden.

11:37.281 --> 11:40.367
-I can't help that.
-So you send him to his death?

11:40.450 --> 11:42.619
It was his choice
to take up the gauntlet.

MERLIN: No, I love old crypts.

already broken out.

12:32.669 --> 12:36.089
Tristan de Bois was the
brother of Ygraine, Uther's wife.

-Arthur's mother?
-Ygraine died in childbirth,

12:39.259 --> 12:42.554

and came to the gates of Camelot

12:42.679 --> 12:45.098
-and challenged him.
-To single combat?

12:45.182 --> 12:49.478
Uther won. But in his dying
breath, Tristan cursed Camelot

12:49.561 --> 12:51.688

Men don't rise from the dead

It's my guess,
we're dealing with a Wraith.

13:02.866 --> 13:04.284
A Wraith?

13:04.368 --> 13:07.412
The spirit of a dead man
conjured from the grave.

13:08.747 --> 13:10.624
This is
the work of a sorcerer?

13:10.707 --> 13:13.835
Powerful magic can harness
the grief and rage of a demented soul

13:13.919 --> 13:16.338
-and make it live again.
-How do we stop it?

13:16.421 --> 13:20.133
We can't. Because it's not
alive, no mortal weapon can Kkill it.

13:20.258 --> 13:21.426
Surely there must be something.

-Revenge.

What does it mean
for Sir Pellinor?

it doesn't look good.

-You were right.
-I wish I wasn't.

15:37.938 --> 15:39.439
If Arthur fights that
thing he will die.

15:39.523 --> 15:41.233
He is Camelot's
strongest warrior.

15:41.358 --> 15:43.068
If anyone can
defeat it, he can.

15:43.193 --> 15:46.404
You said yourself,
no mortal weapon can Kill it.

15:46.530 --> 15:48.698
Which means we have to find a way to
defeat the Wraith ourselves.

15:48.782 --> 15:50.534
How do you propose to do that?

15:50.617 --> 15:53.036
If no mortal
sword will kill it...

15:55.705 --> 15:59.543
Then I will.
With mortal magic.

-Merlin, it's too dangerous.
-We don't have a choice.

- I believe he's a Wraith.
-A spirit?

20:25.517 --> 20:29.229
Soon Arthur will be slain.
You will have sent him to his death.

20:29.312 --> 20:32.357
-Haven't you tired of revenge?
-Haven't you?

20:33.650 --> 20:36.027
You began this war when you
threw me from the court

20:36.152 --> 20:37.987
and slaughtered
all of my kind.

20:38.113 --> 20:40.907
You brought it on yourselves,
you practiced evil.

20:40.990 --> 20:43.868
| was your friend, Uther!
You welcomed me here.

20:44.119 --> 20:47.247
-You betrayed that friendship!
- I did as you asked!

20:48.498 --> 20:50.708
| used
the magic you so despise

20:50.834 --> 20:53.670
to give your barren wife
the son you craved.

20:54.379 --> 20:58.299
Don't ever speak
of her in that way!

20:59.551 --> 21:02.554
She was my heart, my soul.

21:03.179 --> 21:04.722
And you took her from me.

21:04.848 --> 21:07.517
She died giving
birth to your son!

21:08.184 --> 21:09.769
It was not my choice.

21:10.854 --> 21:12.522
That is the law of magic.

21:13.815 --> 21:15.817
To create a life
there had to be a death,

21:15.900 --> 21:17.902
the balance of the world
had to be repaid.

21:18.027 --> 21:20.864
-You knew it would Kill her!
-No, you're wrong.

21:23.241 --> 21:27.704
If I had foreseen her death and the
terrible retribution you would seek,

21:29.664 --> 21:31.666
| would never have
granted your wish.

21:34.711 --> 21:35.712
| wish you hadn't.

21:37.547 --> 21:39.048
You wish you
didn't have a son?

21:42.552 --> 21:44.554
Well, your wish
will come true tomorrow.

21:45.221 --> 21:47.056
| will not let you take him.

21:48.016 --> 21:53.146
| have watched so many people I love die
at your hands, Uther Pendragon.

21:54.481 --> 21:56.983
Now it is your turn.

22:16.085 --> 22:18.505
-How did you get in here?
-The door was open.

22:18.588 --> 22:21.508
-No, I locked it.
-Well, someone else must've opened it.

22:21.591 --> 22:23.927
And you thought you'd come in
and help yourself?

22:24.052 --> 22:27.847
| was looking for a book.
For Gaius.

22:27.931 --> 22:29.766
He thinks the Black Knight
is a Wraith.

22:29.849 --> 22:33.019
-Then Arthur's in grave peril.
-Which is why I'm here.

22:33.102 --> 22:36.523
| need to find
a weapon that will kill something

22:37.565 --> 22:39.025
that's already dead.

22:39.108 --> 22:41.361
I've read of such
things in the ancient chronicles.

22:41.444 --> 22:42.695
Really. What did they say?

22:42.779 --> 22:45.365
Well, several fables
speak of ancient swords.

22:45.448 --> 22:46.783
That can kill the dead?

22:46.866 --> 22:50.620
Swords the fables speak of
could destroy anything, alive or dead.

22:50.703 --> 22:54.040
-Can you show me one of these fables?
-Well...

22:54.123 --> 22:56.876
Let me think. Yes.

23:02.215 --> 23:06.594
-I'm, sort of, in a hurry.
-Yes, you young people always are.

23:11.808 --> 23:13.560
This is
The Chronicle of Beltane.

23:15.270 --> 23:18.147
Now then... Ah! Here we are.

23:19.482 --> 23:22.151
Sir Marhaus looked
upon the great sword,

23:22.235 --> 23:26.155
begotten in the Dragon's
breath and found it passing good.

23:26.239 --> 23:28.658
-What did you say?
-Sir Marhaus looked...

23:28.783 --> 23:32.579
No, no, no. Not about him.
The dragon.

23:34.497 --> 23:38.334
The great sword
begotten in the Dragon's breath

23:38.459 --> 23:40.169
and found it passing good.

23:43.131 --> 23:46.634
-Merlin, what are you doing here?
-I've come to ask a favor.

23:46.968 --> 23:49.679
-Yes?
-I'm not sure how to ask it.

23:50.847 --> 23:54.017
Ask, Merlin, you know
| would grant you anything.

23:55.852 --> 23:57.687
| mean, not anything.

23:58.980 --> 24:00.440
Obviously, not anything.

24:01.149 --> 24:05.612
-What is it you want?
-I've come to ask for a sword,

24:05.695 --> 24:08.364
the strongest sword
your father's ever made.

24:08.489 --> 24:09.532
What for?

24:10.241 --> 24:11.993
To save Arthur.

24:26.215 --> 24:28.134
| don't want you
to fight tomorrow.

24:28.217 --> 24:29.218
(SCOFFS)

24:31.387 --> 24:32.472
You're worried about me?

24:34.724 --> 24:36.059
| don't know what it is.

24:37.685 --> 24:39.854
Please, I'm begging you.

24:40.063 --> 24:41.898
| have to do this.

24:42.398 --> 24:43.566
It's my duty.

24:47.403 --> 24:48.780
| understand.

25:03.711 --> 25:04.754
I'm sorry.

25:08.591 --> 25:11.761
You knew that one day, this business
will come back to haunt me.

25:11.886 --> 25:15.598
-Not quite so literally.
- Ishould've listened to you.

25:16.808 --> 25:20.728
You said that no good would come of
using witchcraft at Arthur's birth.

25:21.312 --> 25:23.856
You wanted an heir.
You thought it was the only way.

25:23.940 --> 25:26.025
Nimueh told me
there would be a price to pay.

25:26.109 --> 25:29.112
You weren't to know that,
that price would be Ygraine's life.

25:33.574 --> 25:36.452
-I cannot let Arthur die.
-Then you must stop the fight.

25:36.577 --> 25:38.413
No, I will take his place.

25:40.289 --> 25:41.708
Do you know
what you're saying?

25:41.791 --> 25:45.253
Ygraine gave up
her life for him, so must I.

25:45.336 --> 25:47.630
-Uther...
- I have no other choice.

25:47.922 --> 25:49.799
There must be another way.

25:49.924 --> 25:54.137
My death will stop the Wraith
and Arthur will live.

25:55.972 --> 25:58.057
But it means
that you're the only person left

25:58.141 --> 26:01.310
who knows the truth
about Arthur's birth.

26:02.645 --> 26:05.857
| want you to swear to me
that you will keep your oath.

26:13.489 --> 26:15.658
| would take it to my grave.

26:19.203 --> 26:23.166
You have always
been a good friend, despite my temper.

26:25.793 --> 26:28.671
| always thought
that would be the death of you.

26:32.133 --> 26:34.385
| have one other favor
to ask.

26:37.013 --> 26:38.598
My father's been saving this.

26:39.849 --> 26:42.602
He's always said
it was the best sword he's ever made.

26:42.685 --> 26:44.020
It's perfect.

26:44.145 --> 26:45.855
He'll kill me if he finds
I've taken it.

26:47.356 --> 26:48.649
He'll understand.

26:49.525 --> 26:51.319
You did it for Arthur.

26:52.487 --> 26:54.655
| knew you were
proud of him really.

27:25.436 --> 27:27.605
-Merlin!
-Do you know why I'm here?

27:28.731 --> 27:30.066
It may surprise you, Merlin,

27:30.149 --> 27:33.236
but my knowledge of your life
is not universal.

27:33.319 --> 27:35.029
It's to do with Arthur.

27:35.112 --> 27:38.407
His life's in danger.
He will die, unless,

27:38.491 --> 27:41.327
| can make a weapon
that will kill the dead.

27:42.829 --> 27:45.581
So what do you
come to ask of me?

27:54.423 --> 27:57.343
Will you burnish
it to save Arthur?

27:58.344 --> 28:01.681
The dead do not return
without reason.

28:01.764 --> 28:04.934
-Who has he come for?
-Uther.

28:05.476 --> 28:07.478
Then let him
take his vengeance

28:07.603 --> 28:10.064
and the Wraith will die
without my aid.

28:10.147 --> 28:13.901
But it's Arthur's who's going to fight
him. You have to save him.

28:13.985 --> 28:17.864
That is your destiny,
young warlock, not mine.

28:17.947 --> 28:21.492
But if Arthur fights the Wraith and
dies, Camelot will have no heir.

28:21.617 --> 28:23.327
| will have no destiny.

28:24.662 --> 28:28.040
A weapon forged
with my assistance

28:28.124 --> 28:30.710
will have great power.

28:30.793 --> 28:33.504
-I know.
-You do not know.

28:33.629 --> 28:38.509
You can only guess.
You have not seen what I have seen.

28:38.634 --> 28:42.638
If you had,
perhaps you would not ask this of me.

28:42.972 --> 28:44.223
What do you mean?

28:44.307 --> 28:48.269
In the wrong hands
this sword could do great evil.

28:48.352 --> 28:52.732
It must be wielded by Arthur
and him alone.

28:52.815 --> 28:53.983
| understand.

28:54.066 --> 28:56.444
You must do more
than understand.

28:56.527 --> 28:58.571
You must promise.

29:00.072 --> 29:01.407
| promise.

29:44.367 --> 29:47.370
Heed my words.

29:47.453 --> 29:51.248
The sword was
forged for Arthur

29:51.374 --> 29:53.000
and him alone.

30:05.388 --> 30:06.806
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

30:06.889 --> 30:09.892
I've brought you something
that might help you sleep.

30:09.976 --> 30:12.144
I'm fine. I don't need it.

30:12.687 --> 30:13.771
Here.

30:14.814 --> 30:18.484
To relax you,
take the edge off your nerves.

30:28.953 --> 30:30.329
(CLEARS THROAT)

30:30.413 --> 30:32.206
| wouldn't drink
it for pleasure.

30:33.374 --> 30:35.334
Why don't you sit
down for a moment?

30:42.258 --> 30:45.386
Mind you,
if you forget about the taste,

30:46.137 --> 30:49.348
the after effect is
quite pleasurable.

30:50.725 --> 30:53.060
Just lie back.

31:26.844 --> 31:28.846
(SIGHING HEAVILY)

31:59.585 --> 32:01.253
That's a fine blade.

32:05.007 --> 32:06.342
It's for Arthur.

32:06.425 --> 32:07.927
He won't be needing it today.

32:10.638 --> 32:12.431
| will be taking
Arthur's place.

32:13.057 --> 32:15.768
-But, Sire...
-Prepare me for battle.

32:16.268 --> 32:17.853
Arthur should be the one
that fights today.

32:17.937 --> 32:20.981
The grievance was with me,
the fight is mine.

32:21.398 --> 32:22.983
| don't have your armor.

32:23.818 --> 32:24.860
That will do.

32:25.444 --> 32:27.154
It's likely to make
little difference.

32:29.615 --> 32:32.701
-I'll get you your sword.
-This one will be fine.

32:32.785 --> 32:35.371
No,
Sire, you don't understand.

32:36.247 --> 32:39.125
That one was made
specifically for Arthur.

32:39.208 --> 32:43.045
-Who made it?
-Tom, the blacksmith.

32:45.131 --> 32:46.590
It's worthy of a King.

32:47.383 --> 32:50.052
You would be better off
with a sword you trusted.

32:51.637 --> 32:54.682
No.
It has almost perfect balance.

32:58.018 --> 32:59.520
Tom's not the
royal sword smith.

32:59.603 --> 33:01.522
I'm surprised
Arthur went to him.

33:01.605 --> 33:02.731
That was me.

33:05.985 --> 33:08.571
| felt he needed
a better sword.

33:12.825 --> 33:15.828
You show him
the most extraordinary loyalty.

33:17.204 --> 33:19.039
That is my job, Sire.

33:19.123 --> 33:22.168
-But beyond the line of duty.
-Well...

33:25.171 --> 33:28.883
You could say
there is a bond between us.

33:30.885 --> 33:33.012
I'm glad.

33:34.263 --> 33:36.557
Look after him.

33:44.106 --> 33:45.608
(EXHALING)

34:14.969 --> 34:16.597
You can have
what you came for,

34:18.891 --> 34:21.101
the father, not the son.

35:13.153 --> 35:14.989
(SWORDS CLASHING)

(ROARING)

37:43.178 --> 37:46.014
(ALL CHEERING)

38:09.455 --> 38:11.707
| thought you said
a Wraith couldn't be killed.

38:12.958 --> 38:15.169
Yes, it was remarkable.

38:16.879 --> 38:18.839
Is that a new sword, Sire?

38:20.007 --> 38:21.884
It's the best I've
ever fought with.

38:22.009 --> 38:24.553
May I have a look?

38:24.636 --> 38:27.055
| was intrigued
by those markings.

38:28.307 --> 38:30.851
On one side it says,
"Take me up,"

38:32.394 --> 38:34.229
and on the other,
"Cast me away."

38:34.313 --> 38:35.481
What does that mean?

38:35.564 --> 38:38.817
-May I ask who made it, Sire?
-Merlin gave it me.

38:38.901 --> 38:40.903
It was forged for Arthur.

38:46.533 --> 38:50.162
That should heal pretty quickly.
I'll redress it tomorrow.

38:50.245 --> 38:53.165
Thank you, Gaius.
Thank you for everything.

38:53.248 --> 38:55.959
You had Gaius drug me.

38:57.169 --> 39:00.255
- Was meant to fight him.
-No, you weren't.

39:00.339 --> 39:03.258
-But the Knight's Code is very clear.
-Be damned!

39:03.926 --> 39:07.012
| believed you would die
and that was a risk I couldn't take.

39:07.095 --> 39:08.722
You are too precious to me.

39:09.097 --> 39:12.100
You mean more to me
than anything I know.

39:12.893 --> 39:16.897
More than this entire kingdom,
and certainly more than my own life.

39:19.066 --> 39:21.860
I've always thought that...

39:21.944 --> 39:23.028
What?

39:24.279 --> 39:27.783
That I was
a big disappointment to you.

39:29.785 --> 39:32.120
That is my
fault and not yours.

39:34.039 --> 39:38.210
You are my only son
and I wouldn't wish for another.

39:45.217 --> 39:47.928
- I heard you fought pretty well.
-Thanks.

39:48.887 --> 39:50.931
You should join
us for training.

39:51.932 --> 39:53.642
Sort out your footwork.

39:55.602 --> 39:57.187
I'll show you footwork.

40:22.087 --> 40:24.840
-You know why I'm looking at you.
-No.

40:24.965 --> 40:28.176
Uther told me you provided him
with his sword today.

40:28.302 --> 40:32.264
It must have been
a very powerful blade to slay the dead.

40:32.347 --> 40:35.684
-Did you enchant it?
-No, I didn't.

40:35.809 --> 40:37.519
-Who did then?
-Wasn't me.

40:39.980 --> 40:43.108
Shame,
it saved the King's life,

40:43.191 --> 40:45.861
I'd have been
very proud of you.

So does Arthur live?

41:35.410 --> 41:38.914
Yes, the sword worked.
It was incredible, amazing.

41:39.164 --> 41:41.667
-As I promised.
-But...

41:41.750 --> 41:43.001
Yes?

41:44.753 --> 41:47.172
Things didn't quite go
according to plan.

Uther's the King.
| couldn't stop him.

42:04.231 --> 42:08.026
The sword was born
of the old magic.

42:08.110 --> 42:11.613
You have no idea of its power.

42:12.364 --> 42:16.201
In the hands of Uther,
it will bring only evil.

-You have betrayed me.

ready to be trusted.

You can destroy it.

What is made cannot be unmade.

42:30.298 --> 42:32.384
So what do you want me to do?

42:32.467 --> 42:35.387
Take the sword far from here

42:35.470 --> 42:39.224
and place it
where no mortal man

42:39.307 --> 42:41.101
can ever find it.

44:21.409 --> 44:23.745
MERLIN:
I'm going back to Ealdor.

44:25.372 --> 44:28.667
If you used your magic
then no one else would have to die.

44:28.750 --> 44:30.502
There's too many of them.

44:30.585 --> 44:33.839
MERLIN: If it comes to a
choice between saving people's lives

44:33.922 --> 44:36.925
and revealing who I really am,
then there is no choice.

44:37.050 --> 44:38.760
You can't let Arthur
know about your gift.
