WEBVTT

00:01.669 --> 00:02.753
"WHERE'S THE LADIES' ROOM?"

00:01.669 --> 00:02.753
"MORE COFFEE, PLEASE."

00:02.753 --> 00:04.004
"DOES ANTONIO BANDERAS

00:02.753 --> 00:04.004
LIVE NEAR HERE?"

00:04.004 --> 00:06.047
WE DON'T NEED TO KNOW

00:04.004 --> 00:06.047
HOW TO SAY

00:06.047 --> 00:07.591
"DOES ANTONIO BANDERAS

00:06.047 --> 00:07.591
LIVE NEAR HERE?"

00:07.591 --> 00:08.634
YES, WE DO.

00:08.634 --> 00:09.677
WHEN WE'RE IN SPAIN,

00:09.677 --> 00:11.470
WE NEED TO KNOW HOW TO SAY

00:11.470 --> 00:13.096
"DOES ANTONIO BANDERAS

00:11.470 --> 00:13.096
LIVE NEAR HERE?"

00:13.096 --> 00:14.723
WHEN IN FRANCE, "DOES

00:13.096 --> 00:14.723
JOHNNY DEPP LIVE NEAR HERE?"

00:14.723 --> 00:16.767
WHEN IN ROME, "DOES GORE VIDAL

00:14.723 --> 00:16.767
LIVE NEAR HERE?"

00:16.767 --> 00:20.145
YOU LOOK LIKE ME, YET MY WAYS

00:16.767 --> 00:20.145
ARE COMPLETELY LOST ON YOU.

00:20.145 --> 00:22.898
PUT THAT DOWN.

00:20.145 --> 00:22.898
YOU'VE BEEN STUDYING ALL DAY.

00:22.898 --> 00:24.650
I'VE GOT FINALS COMING UP.

00:24.650 --> 00:26.485
I KNOW YOU HAVE

00:24.650 --> 00:26.485
FINALS COMING UP,

00:26.485 --> 00:29.196
BUT YOU ALSO HAVE A PIECE OF PIE

00:26.485 --> 00:29.196
YOU'RE COMPLETELY IGNORING.

00:29.196 --> 00:30.489
LET ME END THIS CHAPTER.

00:30.489 --> 00:32.825
OH, FINE.

00:32.825 --> 00:34.576
HEY, HOW IMPORTANT IS

00:34.576 --> 00:36.161
"HELP, I'M BLEEDING

00:34.576 --> 00:36.161
FROM THE HEAD"?

00:36.161 --> 00:38.038
JUST BRING THE PHRASE BOOKS.

00:38.038 --> 00:41.500
IF WE LEARN ALL THE PHRASES

00:38.038 --> 00:41.500
WE WON'T HAVE TO LUG AROUND.

00:41.500 --> 00:43.794
WE'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO LEARN

00:41.500 --> 00:43.794
ALL THE PHRASES

00:43.794 --> 00:45.295
IN EVERY LANGUAGE.

00:43.794 --> 00:45.295
BRING THE BOOKS.

00:45.295 --> 00:47.088
WE CAN LEARN ENOUGH.

00:45.295 --> 00:47.088
PLUS DOESN'T EVERYBODY

00:47.088 --> 00:48.131
SPEAK ENGLISH THERE ANYWAY?

00:48.131 --> 00:49.717
UGLY AMERICAN, PARTY OF ONE.

00:49.717 --> 00:50.926
FINE,

00:49.717 --> 00:50.926
WE'LL BRING THE BOOKS.

00:50.926 --> 00:53.094
OKAY,

00:50.926 --> 00:53.094
FIVE MINUTES FOR PIE.

00:53.094 --> 00:54.262
FINALLY.

00:54.262 --> 00:55.848
THEY'RE HERE!

00:54.262 --> 00:55.848
I'VE GOT THEM!

00:55.848 --> 00:58.392
YOU GOT WHAT?

00:55.848 --> 00:58.392
THE BROCHURES

00:55.848 --> 00:58.392
FOR MY COLLEGE!

00:58.392 --> 01:00.143
YOU SEEM CHIPPER.

00:58.392 --> 01:00.143
I AM.

01:00.143 --> 01:01.854
I HAVE DECIDED TO MAKE

01:01.854 --> 01:04.481
THIS WHOLE 7-DAY ADVENTIST

01:01.854 --> 01:04.481
COLLEGE EXPERIENCE A GOOD ONE.

01:04.481 --> 01:06.274
I'M GONNA LOOK

01:04.481 --> 01:06.274
ON THE BRIGHT SIDE

01:06.274 --> 01:07.860
AND MAKE MYSELF SOME

01:06.274 --> 01:07.860
LEMONADE.

01:07.860 --> 01:09.904
OH, GOOD FOR YOU.

01:07.860 --> 01:09.904
THE CAMPUS LOOKS PRETTY.

01:09.904 --> 01:10.905
VERY PRETTY.

01:10.905 --> 01:12.239
IT'S GOT TWO HUGE PARKS

01:12.239 --> 01:13.824
WITH GARDENS AND LAKES.

01:13.824 --> 01:16.284
TWO PARKS.

01:13.824 --> 01:16.284
ONE FOR BOYS,

01:13.824 --> 01:16.284
ONE FOR GIRLS,

01:16.284 --> 01:18.037
HUH.

01:18.037 --> 01:20.581
I ORIGINALLY THOUGHT THIS

01:18.037 --> 01:20.581
WAS GONNA BE A SUFFOCATING PLACE

01:20.581 --> 01:22.457
WITH OUT-OF-DATE RULES

01:20.581 --> 01:22.457
AND INSANE RESTRICTIONS,

01:22.457 --> 01:23.751
BUT, BOY, WAS I WRONG.

01:23.751 --> 01:26.127
FOR EXAMPLE,

01:23.751 --> 01:26.127
CURFEW IS UP TO 9:30,

01:26.127 --> 01:28.171
9:45, IF YOU'RE GOING FOR

01:26.127 --> 01:28.171
YOUR MASTER'S.

01:28.171 --> 01:29.882
MAKEUP WILL BE PERMITTED

01:29.882 --> 01:32.593
AS LONG AS IT IDENTICALLY

01:29.882 --> 01:32.593
MATCHES YOUR SKIN TONE,

01:32.593 --> 01:34.302
AND OWNING

01:32.593 --> 01:34.302
A ROLLING STONES CD

01:34.302 --> 01:36.013
IS NO LONGER GROUNDS

01:34.302 --> 01:36.013
FOR EXPULSION.

01:36.013 --> 01:38.599
YOU CAN WORK THE DEMERITS OFF

01:36.013 --> 01:38.599
IN THE CAMPUS-CLEANUP CREW.

01:38.599 --> 01:40.809
THERE'S A SEPARATE PARK

01:38.599 --> 01:40.809
FOR BOYS?

01:40.809 --> 01:43.353
MY LIFE IS OVER.

01:40.809 --> 01:43.353
OH, NO,

01:40.809 --> 01:43.353
I DIDN'T SAY THAT!

01:43.353 --> 01:46.023
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO!

01:46.023 --> 01:47.816
WELL, IT<i> IS</i> OVER.

01:46.023 --> 01:47.816
IT'S NOT OVER.

01:47.816 --> 01:50.110
EVERY KID IN THAT BROCHURE

01:47.816 --> 01:50.110
WAS AWKWARD AND PANICKED.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.904
IT LOOKED LIKE THE

01:50.110 --> 01:51.904
ACADEMY AWARD AUDIENCE

01:51.904 --> 01:52.947
DURING MICHAEL MOORE'S

01:51.904 --> 01:52.947
SPEECH.

01:52.947 --> 01:54.197
HEY, WHY DON'T YOU ADD

01:54.197 --> 01:55.950
"JUST SIT THERE

01:54.197 --> 01:55.950
AND LOOK PRETTY"

01:55.950 --> 01:58.911
TO THAT LIST OF YOURS, OKAY?

I'VE BEEN SNEAKING

03:40.888 --> 03:44.474
AROUND HERE LIKE AN IDIOT

03:40.888 --> 03:44.474
TRYING NOT TO WAKE YOU UP.

03:44.474 --> 03:47.561
I'VE BEEN UP FOR HOURS.

03:50.898 --> 03:52.941
AT THIS RATE,

03:52.941 --> 03:54.735
I WILL NEVER FINISH

03:52.941 --> 03:54.735
ALL MY WORK.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.778

03:54.735 --> 03:56.778
"WHAT WORK?" SHE ASKS.

03:56.778 --> 03:58.822
WELL, YOU KNOW ME

03:56.778 --> 03:58.822

HERE.

04:00.866 --> 04:03.368
"THINGS TO DO BEFORE

04:00.866 --> 04:03.368
GRADUATION."

04:03.368 --> 04:05.079
A LIST!

04:03.368 --> 04:05.079

BOOSTER-CLUB GRAD-NIGHT TABLE,

04:19.509 --> 04:22.596
AT THE SAME TIME

04:22.596 --> 04:24.639
SO WE CAN FEEL STUPID

04:22.596 --> 04:24.639
AND ABUSED TOGETHER.

04:24.639 --> 04:27.017
I CAN'T FINISH

04:24.639 --> 04:27.017
AND SLEEP AT THE SAME TIME.

04:27.017 --> 04:29.186
YOU HAVE TO SLEEP.

04:27.017 --> 04:29.186
IT KEEPS YOU PRETTY.

04:29.186 --> 04:31.230
WHO CARES ABOUT PRETTY

04:29.186 --> 04:31.230
IF I FAIL?

04:31.230 --> 04:34.233
OKAY, YOU'VE GOT THIS

04:31.230 --> 04:34.233
SO COMPLETELY BACKWARDS.

04:34.233 --> 04:36.235
WHAT IS ALL THIS?

04:36.235 --> 04:38.779
I FOUND THAT IF I FOCUS TOO

04:36.235 --> 04:38.779
MUCH ON ONE SUBJECT,

04:38.779 --> 04:40.363
I START TO GET

04:38.779 --> 04:40.363
A LITTLE PUNCHY.

04:40.363 --> 04:42.866
THIS WAY, WHEN I HIT BOLSHEVIK

04:40.363 --> 04:42.866
REVOLUTION OVERLOAD,

04:42.866 --> 04:45.953
I SHIFT OVER HERE, AND, OH,

04:42.866 --> 04:45.953
HELLO, ANNE BOLYNN

04:42.866 --> 04:45.953
IS GOING DOWN,

04:45.953 --> 04:47.162
AND THEN WHEN THAT GETS

04:45.953 --> 04:47.162
TOO DEPRESSING,

04:47.162 --> 04:49.039
IT'S RIGHT OVER TO CALCULUS.

04:49.039 --> 04:50.832
SAVING THE PARTY SUBJECT

04:49.039 --> 04:50.832
FOR LAST, HUH?

04:50.832 --> 04:53.752
THE SHIFTING BACK AND FORTH

04:50.832 --> 04:53.752
SEEMS TO PRODUCE BETTER RESULTS.

04:53.752 --> 04:55.796
I THINK YOU'RE PUSHING

04:53.752 --> 04:55.796
YOURSELF TOO HARD.

04:55.796 --> 04:58.423
I MADE OUT A SCHEDULE.

04:55.796 --> 04:58.423
EVERY SINGLE MOMENT

04:55.796 --> 04:58.423
OF EVERY SINGLE DAY

04:58.423 --> 05:00.675
FROM NOW UNTIL GRADUATION

04:58.423 --> 05:00.675
IS ACCOUNTED FOR.

05:00.675 --> 05:02.302
YOU LEFT OFF

05:00.675 --> 05:02.302
THE KIWANIS LUNCHEON.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.179
ARE YOU SURE?

05:02.302 --> 05:04.179
IT'S ON MONDAY.

05:04.179 --> 05:05.973
HOW COULD I FORGET

05:04.179 --> 05:05.973
THE KIWANIS LUNCHEON?

05:05.973 --> 05:07.348
THEY GAVE ME

05:05.973 --> 05:07.348
THEIR SCHOLARSHIP.

05:07.348 --> 05:09.101
OH, YES -- $250 SCHOLARSHIP,

05:09.101 --> 05:11.394
THAT'LL KEEP YOU IN

05:09.101 --> 05:11.394

05:11.394 --> 05:14.022
I'LL HAVE TO MOVE SOMETHING.

05:11.394 --> 05:14.022
AND WORK GRANDMA IN.

05:14.022 --> 05:15.690
EXCUSE ME?

05:15.690 --> 05:18.485

05:21.822 --> 05:24.574
SHE'S YET TO SHOW UP WITH

05:21.822 --> 05:24.574
BRA OUTSIDE HER CLOTHING.

05:24.574 --> 05:26.201
SHE ASKED.

05:24.574 --> 05:26.201
I CAN'T SAY NO.

05:26.201 --> 05:28.245
TELL HER ABOUT THE KOALA BEARS.

05:26.201 --> 05:28.245
SHE'LL UNDERSTAND.

05:28.245 --> 05:29.788
PLEASE STOP MAKING FUN

05:28.245 --> 05:29.788
OF THEM.

05:29.788 --> 05:32.332
WE NEED EVERY CENT WE CAN GET.

05:29.788 --> 05:32.332
YALE IS EXPENSIVE.

05:32.332 --> 05:35.460
I KNOW YALE IS EXPENSIVE.

05:32.332 --> 05:35.460
WE HAVEN'T HEARD FROM

05:41.175 --> 05:43.468
AND I HAVE A BUNCH

05:41.175 --> 05:43.468

05:43.468 --> 05:45.344
I WANT TO FINISH THIS

05:43.468 --> 05:45.344

05:45.344 --> 05:48.307
OTHERWISE, I'LL BE OBSESSING

16:17.226 --> 16:19.270
A SUIT SEEMS NICE.

16:19.270 --> 16:21.021
PERHAPS IT'S TOO FORMAL.

16:19.270 --> 16:21.021

WHERE'S THE LIST?

17:27.839 --> 17:31.050

17:31.050 --> 17:33.594
WELL, TERRIFIC, I CAN'T THINK

17:31.050 --> 17:33.594
OF A BETTER PLACE, EXCEPT --

17:33.594 --> 17:36.723
MAYBE OUT ON THE TABLE

17:33.594 --> 17:36.723
WHERE WE COULD LOOK AT IT.

17:51.779 --> 17:54.240

17:57.994 --> 17:59.913

17:57.994 --> 17:59.913
OH.

17:59.913 --> 18:02.999
I WAS MARRIED FOR THE LONGEST

17:59.913 --> 18:02.999
MINUTE AND HALF IN THE WORLD.

18:02.999 --> 18:04.542
HEY, SWEETIE.

18:02.999 --> 18:04.542
HOW'S EVERYTHING?

18:02.999 --> 18:04.542
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

18:04.542 --> 18:06.335
I LOVE THAT.

18:04.542 --> 18:06.335
GIVE REILLY A KISS.

18:06.335 --> 18:07.879
THEN I CAME TO MY SENSES,

18:07.879 --> 18:10.673
RAN FOR THE HILLS,

18:07.879 --> 18:10.673
BUT I GOT LILY, SO I WIN!

18:10.673 --> 18:12.383
HA HA! SHORT CUT.

18:12.383 --> 18:14.928
I MET JIMMY ABOUT

18:12.383 --> 18:14.928
FIVE AND A HALF YEARS AGO,

18:14.928 --> 18:16.930
BUT LILY'S JUST CRAZY

18:20.641 --> 18:24.270

18:24.270 --> 18:27.065
I'LL DO IT FOR YOU IF YOU

18:24.270 --> 18:27.065
DON'T HAVE THE TIME.

18:27.065 --> 18:30.234
GOT ANY BROTHERS

18:27.065 --> 18:30.234
OR SISTERS?

18:27.065 --> 18:30.234
APPARENTLY NOT.

18:30.234 --> 18:32.278
LILY'S SUBMITTED A

18:30.234 --> 18:32.278
WRITTEN REQUEST FOR A BROTHER

18:32.278 --> 18:33.863
BY THE END OF THIS YEAR,

18:33.863 --> 18:36.950
BUT I THINK I SHOULD BE MARRIED

18:33.863 --> 18:36.950
BEFORE WE HAVE ANY KIDS.

18:36.950 --> 18:38.284
YOU GUYS AREN'T MARRIED?

18:38.284 --> 18:39.326
YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT?

18:39.326 --> 18:41.746

18:43.790 --> 18:46.250
YEAH, WELL...

18:46.250 --> 18:48.628
OKAY, WE'RE HERE.

18:51.047 --> 18:53.049
IT LOOKS LIKE

18:51.047 --> 18:53.049
A JAR OF PICKLES.

18:53.049 --> 18:56.636
I KNOW IT'S A JAR OF PICKLES,

18:53.049 --> 18:56.636
BUT IS IT THAT JAR OF PICKLES?

18:56.636 --> 18:57.678
YES!

18:56.636 --> 18:57.678
YOU SURE?

18:57.678 --> 18:58.679
NO.

18:58.679 --> 18:59.973
THE CHICAGO DILLS

18:59.973 --> 19:01.724
WERE THE ORIGINAL PICKLES

18:59.973 --> 19:01.724
THEY SOLD IN --

19:01.724 --> 19:03.810
1922, YES, I LISTEN.

19:03.810 --> 19:06.104
I FINALLY TRACKED DOWN

19:03.810 --> 19:06.104
THE FAMILY THAT SOLD THEM,

19:06.104 --> 19:08.648
I PAID A SUBSTANTIAL PREMIUM

19:06.104 --> 19:08.648
TO USE THE ORIGINAL LABELS.

19:08.648 --> 19:11.109
NOW THEY'RE HERE,

19:08.648 --> 19:11.109
AND I LOOK AT THEM,

19:11.109 --> 19:13.486
AND THEY DON'T LOOK THE SAME --

19:11.109 --> 19:13.486
TOO MANY BUMPS.

19:13.486 --> 19:15.404
JIMMY, I'M BEGGING YOU --

19:13.486 --> 19:15.404
PLAY GOLF.

19:15.404 --> 19:18.365
JUST CALL THE GUY AND TELL THEM

19:15.404 --> 19:18.365
THEY LOOK DIFFERENT, PLEASE.

19:18.365 --> 19:20.493
WHATEVER YOU SAY.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.996
JIMMY.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.996

20:04.954 --> 20:05.913
THANKS.

20:08.749 --> 20:10.543
HEY, WHY DON'T

20:08.749 --> 20:10.543
I COME OUT THERE?

20:10.543 --> 20:12.336
I DIDN'T MEAN TO INTERRUPT.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.336
NO PROBLEM.

20:12.336 --> 20:14.380
LEE, I'M GONNA

20:12.336 --> 20:14.380

20:14.380 --> 20:16.132
THANK GOD.

20:22.429 --> 20:25.432
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

20:22.429 --> 20:25.432
IT'S FINE.

20:27.018 --> 20:28.811
SO, FIRST TIME

20:27.018 --> 20:28.811

20:28.811 --> 20:31.898

ON THE WEST COAST.

20:28.811 --> 20:31.898
OKAY.

20:31.898 --> 20:34.358
THE SIGHTS.

20:34.358 --> 20:35.526
OCEAN.

20:35.526 --> 20:37.070
I WONDERED WHAT THAT WAS.

20:35.526 --> 20:37.070
SAND.

20:37.070 --> 20:39.864
KEEPS THE OCEAN

20:37.070 --> 20:39.864
IN ITS PLACE.

20:37.070 --> 20:39.864
SKY.

20:39.864 --> 20:42.324
WE GOT ONE OF THOSE

20:39.864 --> 20:42.324

20:42.324 --> 20:44.326
AND THEN YOU HAVE

20:42.324 --> 20:44.326

20:44.326 --> 20:46.746
SUNGLASSES, SMOOTHIES,

20:44.326 --> 20:46.746
BOOTLEG CDs.

20:46.746 --> 20:51.291
GOOD ONES?

20:46.746 --> 20:51.291
I NEVER ACTUALLY BOUGHT ONE.

JESS, MAN, COME ON,

38:55.416 --> 38:57.627
YOU CAN'T STAY HERE.

38:57.627 --> 39:00.172
WHY NOT? WHY NOT?

38:57.627 --> 39:00.172
'CAUSE YOU CAN'T!

39:00.172 --> 39:02.132
WHY NOT?

39:00.172 --> 39:02.132
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T!

39:02.132 --> 39:04.134
I WANT TO ASK "WHY NOT,"

39:04.134 --> 39:06.427
BUT THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE

39:04.134 --> 39:06.427
GETTING ME ANYWHERE.

39:06.427 --> 39:09.014
LOOK AT ME, JESS.

39:06.427 --> 39:09.014
I'M NOT A FATHER. NEVER WAS.

39:09.014 --> 39:11.099
I LEFT YOU BECAUSE

39:09.014 --> 39:11.099
I WASN'T A FATHER.

39:11.099 --> 39:12.684
THE MINUTE THE CIGAR

39:11.099 --> 39:12.684
WAS FINISHED,

39:12.684 --> 39:14.269
I WAS LIKE,

39:12.684 --> 39:14.269
"WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

39:14.269 --> 39:16.313
HOW YOU GONNA TAKE CARE

39:14.269 --> 39:16.313
OF SOMEONE ELSE?!"

39:16.313 --> 39:19.107
THAT'S NOT --

39:16.313 --> 39:19.107
I CAN'T TAKE YOU IN.

39:16.313 --> 39:19.107
I CAN'T RAISE YOU.

39:19.107 --> 39:20.984
RAISE ME?! I'M 18!

39:19.107 --> 39:20.984
I'M RAISED!

39:20.984 --> 39:23.278
I CAN VOTE, BE DRAFTED.

39:20.984 --> 39:23.278
IT'S A LITTLE LATE

39:23.278 --> 39:25.571
TO THROW ME A TEENAGE MUTANT

39:23.278 --> 39:25.571
NINJA TURTLE PARTY.

39:25.571 --> 39:27.615
THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T COME

39:25.571 --> 39:27.615
TO BUST MY BALLS.

39:27.615 --> 39:30.285
PUT THE BAT DOWN, MAN!

39:27.615 --> 39:30.285
I DON'T NEED A DADDY!

39:30.285 --> 39:32.245
I JUST NEED A PLACE TO CRASH.

39:32.245 --> 39:34.956
DO YOU UNDERSTAND IT'S ONLY

39:32.245 --> 39:34.956
IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS

39:34.956 --> 39:37.042
I EVEN STARTED

39:34.956 --> 39:37.042
TO PUT MY LIFE TOGETHER?

39:37.042 --> 39:38.584
YOU DON'T WANNA BE

39:37.042 --> 39:38.584
AROUND ME.

39:38.584 --> 39:41.046
I AM A SCREW-UP.

39:38.584 --> 39:41.046
THAT IS MY GENETIC CODE.

39:41.046 --> 39:43.256
THE APPLE DOESN'T FALL

39:41.046 --> 39:43.256
TOO FAR FROM THE TREE.

39:43.256 --> 39:46.051
DON'T SAY THAT. YOU'RE YOUNG.

39:43.256 --> 39:46.051
YOU CAN DO ANYTHING YOU WANT.

39:46.051 --> 39:48.094
A MONTH.

39:46.051 --> 39:48.094
JUST LET ME STAY --

39:48.094 --> 39:50.847
ARE YOU LISTENING?! I HAVE

39:48.094 --> 39:50.847
NOTHING TO OFFER YOU! NOTHING!

39:50.847 --> 39:53.850
YOU HAVE NOTHING?

39:50.847 --> 39:53.850
I HAVE<i> NOTHING!</i>

39:53.850 --> 39:56.644
I HAVE NO PLACE TO GO!

39:53.850 --> 39:56.644
CAN'T STAY AT LUKE'S.

39:56.644 --> 39:59.314
CAN'T STAY IN STARS HOLLOW.

39:56.644 --> 39:59.314
MY MOTHER'S A WHACK JOB!

39:59.314 --> 40:01.358
YOU DON'T WANT

39:59.314 --> 40:01.358
TO TAKE ME OFF

40:01.358 --> 40:03.776
THIS TERRIFIC PATH

40:01.358 --> 40:03.776
I'M HEADED DOWN RIGHT NOW?!

40:03.776 --> 40:05.737
I'M NOT GRADUATING

40:03.776 --> 40:05.737
HIGH SCHOOL!

40:05.737 --> 40:08.073
I DON'T KNOW WHAT

40:05.737 --> 40:08.073
I'LL DO WITH MY LIFE,

40:08.073 --> 40:09.949
BUT I'D BETTER FIND OUT SOON

40:09.949 --> 40:13.912
OR I'LL BE THAT GUY ON THE

40:09.949 --> 40:13.912
BOARDWALK SELLING THE HEMP HATS!

40:18.375 --> 40:19.834
I HAVE ONE OF THOSE.

40:21.086 --> 40:22.754
IT'S A GOOD HAT.

40:28.593 --> 40:29.719
WELL?

40:31.470 --> 40:33.514
I HAVE TO TALK IT OVER

40:31.470 --> 40:33.514
WITH SASHA.

40:33.514 --> 40:36.684
JUST...

40:33.514 --> 40:36.684
TELL HER I'M A DOG.

40:36.684 --> 40:38.395
GREAT IDEA.

40:38.395 --> 40:40.939
YOU COULD SIT THERE AND

40:38.395 --> 40:40.939
LICK YOURSELF WHILE SHE DECIDES,

40:40.939 --> 40:42.399
YOU KNOW, HELP SELL IT.

40:44.025 --> 40:46.569
THANK YOU, JIMMY.

40:46.569 --> 40:49.364
IF SHE SAYS IT'S OKAY,

40:46.569 --> 40:49.364
THEN WE'LL SEE.

40:46.569 --> 40:49.364
FINE, WE'LL SEE.

40:49.364 --> 40:51.449
IT MAY NOT WORK OUT.

40:49.364 --> 40:51.449
I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND.

40:51.449 --> 40:54.953
BUT I'LL ASK, AND IF SHE SAYS

40:51.449 --> 40:54.953
IT'S OKAY, THEN WE'LL SEE.

40:56.746 --> 40:58.164
WE'LL SEE.

41:03.669 --> 41:05.755
OH, MY GOD.

41:03.669 --> 41:05.755
I'M SO TIRED.

41:05.755 --> 41:08.174
HERE'S A THOUGHT --

41:05.755 --> 41:08.174
HOW ABOUT GOING TO BED?

41:05.755 --> 41:08.174
I HAVE TO STUDY.

41:08.174 --> 41:11.261
OR MAKE A POT OF COFFEE

41:08.174 --> 41:11.261
AND ONCE AGAIN GET NO SLEEP.

41:11.261 --> 41:13.221
JUST AS GOOD.

41:13.221 --> 41:15.098
WHAT'S THIS?

41:13.221 --> 41:15.098
THAT'S JUST --

41:15.098 --> 41:17.892
YALE NEEDED MY SOCIAL SECURITY

41:15.098 --> 41:17.892
NUMBER FOR SOMETHING.

41:21.479 --> 41:23.982

41:27.235 --> 41:30.863
EVERYBODY SIGNS EVERYBODY'S

41:27.235 --> 41:30.863

41:30.863 --> 41:33.616
"RORY, HAVE A GREAT SUMMER.

"HEY, ARORY BOREALIS."

41:40.039 --> 41:41.833
OKAY, CAN'T TALK TO THIS

41:40.039 --> 41:41.833

41:41.833 --> 41:43.876

42:12.405 --> 42:14.615
