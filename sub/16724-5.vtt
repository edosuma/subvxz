[theme music playing]

00:20.186 --> 00:23.231
[Chuck on PA] I want to give a big
Chuck Charles thanks to all you people

00:23.314 --> 00:25.984
for coming down to this year's
Wharf It Down Food Festival,

00:26.067 --> 00:28.778
which, for so many years,
has been a strange, slightly sad event,

00:28.862 --> 00:31.031
where artisans try to sell
specialty foods.

00:31.114 --> 00:33.450
But not this year, thanks to me,
Chuck Charles,

00:33.533 --> 00:35.827
and our 1st Annual Best Burger Contest.

00:37.162 --> 00:38.496
We've met our contestants,

00:38.580 --> 00:41.166
we've explained the rules of this really,
truly, simple event.

00:41.249 --> 00:44.002
But the only thing we haven't done
is start the clock. Here we go.

00:44.836 --> 00:46.880
All right, Bob. Let's do it, let's win.

00:46.963 --> 00:48.882
-Win. Win. Win. Let's go.
-Lin, please.

00:48.965 --> 00:51.426
-Take it down a notch, okay? Or five?
-Kids, come on.

00:51.509 --> 00:52.510
Cheer for your father.

00:52.594 --> 00:53.845
Cheer. Cheer. Cheer.

00:53.928 --> 00:54.929
Lin, stop.

00:55.013 --> 00:56.765
Dad, big smile, big energy.

00:56.848 --> 00:57.807
That's it, doll.

00:57.891 --> 00:59.893
Hey, you're sweating
too much already, buddy.

00:59.976 --> 01:00.810
Pace yourself.

01:00.894 --> 01:01.853
Go, Mom and Dad.

01:01.936 --> 01:04.898
Stay there and cook, don't go anywhere.
Sorry if I'm being confusing.

01:04.981 --> 01:07.108
Okay, come on. Go. Cook. Cook. Cook.

01:07.192 --> 01:10.320
Let's check-in with our contestants.
Skip Marooch.

01:10.403 --> 01:12.781
-Uh, am I saying that right?
-Yes, Skip.

01:12.864 --> 01:15.700
Great. So, you're from Pakistan,
you've got a successful restaurant.

01:15.784 --> 01:17.702
You're on a book tour.
Guy, what can't you do?

01:17.786 --> 01:19.788
Complain, everything is going so well.

01:19.871 --> 01:21.581
[both laughing]

01:21.664 --> 01:24.167
This guy. So, what are you making today?
I already love you.

01:24.250 --> 01:26.086
Well, today,
I will be making a pomegranate

01:26.169 --> 01:30.048
and green chili chutney burger
with my grandmother's special spice blend.

01:30.131 --> 01:31.424
Two words: yum and yum.

01:31.508 --> 01:33.843
She always told me,
"Put spice on everything."

01:33.927 --> 01:37.263
She also said, "I hate Mondays,"
but she never got credit for that.

01:39.391 --> 01:40.642
I would love to meet her.

01:40.725 --> 01:41.810
-Ah, too late.
-Oh.

01:41.893 --> 01:43.353
Sheesh, I know we're here for Bob.

01:43.436 --> 01:45.772
-But it's hard to root against that guy.
-He is likable.

01:45.855 --> 01:47.565
Shush. I can't hear them cooking.

01:47.649 --> 01:50.985
Skip Marooch, I can't believe
we're competing against that guy.

01:51.069 --> 01:52.779
He has a book, I read it.

01:52.862 --> 01:54.280
I mean, I mostly read it.

01:54.364 --> 01:57.701
I looked at all the pictures.
Why did I think this was a good idea?

01:57.784 --> 01:59.703
You know what? I'm signing up.

01:59.786 --> 02:01.079
We're doing it.

02:01.162 --> 02:02.288
Do it. We're doing it.

02:02.372 --> 02:03.415
This feels good.

02:03.498 --> 02:04.374
Do it.

02:04.457 --> 02:05.625
[Louise] Quiet!

02:05.709 --> 02:08.294
I don't know what kind of "doing it"
you're talking about,

02:08.378 --> 02:09.713
but you're too loud!

02:09.796 --> 02:11.089
Sorry. [burps]

02:11.172 --> 02:12.966
[sighs] I really hate contests.

02:13.049 --> 02:16.094
This is why we made a "no signing up
for things while drunk" rule.

02:16.177 --> 02:18.346
What? Gene never would've taken ballet.

02:18.430 --> 02:20.807
Look at Skip over there.
I don't think we can win this.

02:20.890 --> 02:23.685
It's like I'm Rocky and he's Apollo Creed.

02:23.768 --> 02:25.603
That's good. Rocky always won.

02:25.687 --> 02:27.647
Rocky lost in the first movie, Lin.

02:27.731 --> 02:29.899
Oh, but he walked up all those stairs.

02:29.983 --> 02:30.817
That's not fair.

02:30.900 --> 02:33.653
And let's get a few words with Bob
"The Slob" Belcher. Hi.

02:33.737 --> 02:36.448
-That's not my nickname.
-Well, it is now, everyone heard it.

02:36.531 --> 02:39.367
Bob and I have a bit of a history, folks.
I graciously allowed him

02:39.451 --> 02:41.786
onto my morning talk show,
and in turn, he got me fired.

02:41.870 --> 02:43.830
-I didn't get you fired. Linda did.
-Hi, Chuck.

02:43.913 --> 02:47.542
-What stupid burger are you making?
-Okay, well, it's not stupid, it's smart.

02:47.625 --> 02:49.753
I call it the Bet It All
on Black Garlic Burger.

02:49.836 --> 02:51.921
-It's made with-- What?
-Stupid name. Stupid name.

02:52.005 --> 02:53.131
It's not. Oh, my God.

02:53.214 --> 02:54.424
It's made with black garlic.

02:54.507 --> 02:57.427
It's a fermented garlic,
it comes from Korea.

02:57.510 --> 02:59.012
Don't blame Korea for your burger.

02:59.095 --> 03:01.348
-Not fair to them or burgers.
-I'm not blaming them--

03:01.431 --> 03:03.600
Stupid Black Garlic Burger.
Put it up on the screen.

03:03.683 --> 03:05.060
-Oh, my God.
-We made it up.

03:05.143 --> 03:07.020
-Look, we're on the screen.
-Chuck hates us.

03:07.103 --> 03:09.314
-No.
-It's okay, I hate him, too.

03:09.397 --> 03:10.774
God, this was a bad idea.

03:10.857 --> 03:12.817
No. It's fun. It's fun.

03:12.901 --> 03:14.402
We have the Prince of Pizza here

03:14.486 --> 03:16.529
trying to become the Chancellor
of Cheeseburgers.

03:16.613 --> 03:18.365
-Jimmy Pesto.
-Thank you, Chuck.

03:18.448 --> 03:22.160
Uh, Jimmy Pesto's is known
for our family-friendly atmosphere,

03:22.243 --> 03:23.495
festive drink specials

03:23.578 --> 03:25.163
and Italian-flavored foods.

03:25.246 --> 03:28.249
-All right.
-And after I win this contest today,

03:28.333 --> 03:31.336
we're also gonna be known for our
Oregano Burger.

03:31.419 --> 03:34.756
-All right. And what's in that?
-Just a ton of oregano.

03:34.839 --> 03:35.799
The Big O.

03:35.882 --> 03:36.966
Don't say "Big O."

03:37.050 --> 03:38.968
All right,
I won't say anything then, ever.

03:39.052 --> 03:39.928
Sounds horrible.

03:40.011 --> 03:42.097
I guess it's just us and Skip here.

03:42.180 --> 03:44.516
[sighs] All right, time to break out
the black garlic.

03:44.599 --> 03:46.309
-Lin?
-You got it.

03:46.393 --> 03:48.186
-It's not in here.
-Wait. What?

03:48.269 --> 03:49.813
Not in the cooler. It's empty.

03:49.896 --> 03:51.398
Oh, crap. Oh, crap.

03:51.481 --> 03:52.315
Oh, crap.

03:52.399 --> 03:54.442
Oh, crap, crap, crap.

03:54.526 --> 03:56.945
Gene, can you go to the kitchen
and grab the black garlic?

03:57.028 --> 03:58.071
On it.

03:58.154 --> 03:59.239
What color is it?

03:59.322 --> 04:00.615
-It's black, Gene.
-Yup.

04:00.699 --> 04:01.658
Wait. What's black?

04:01.741 --> 04:03.243
The garlic. On the counter.

04:03.326 --> 04:04.994
In the kitchen? Where I am?

04:05.078 --> 04:05.912
Are you?

04:05.995 --> 04:07.038
I think so.

04:07.122 --> 04:09.457
-Well, then, yes, on the counter.
-Okay.

04:09.541 --> 04:11.292
I feel really good about this, Dad.

04:11.376 --> 04:13.878
-I feel great about it.
-Way to go, everybody.

04:13.962 --> 04:15.255
Gene!

04:15.338 --> 04:17.841
Dad! What are we doing?

04:22.303 --> 04:24.973
I asked Gene to get the black garlic
from the kitchen,

04:25.056 --> 04:27.642
the single most important ingredient
in my recipe,

04:27.726 --> 04:29.602
and we're looking at an empty cooler!

04:29.686 --> 04:31.855
-Okay, don't freak out. Hi. Hi, everyone.
-Oh, God.

04:31.938 --> 04:33.023
Hi. Hi. Hello.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.649
I'm not freaking out!

04:34.733 --> 04:35.859
He's fine.

04:35.942 --> 04:37.068
He's silly.

04:37.152 --> 04:38.778
Just put something else on the burger.

04:38.862 --> 04:39.696
What about a...

04:39.779 --> 04:41.531
Oh, a granola bar burger.

04:41.614 --> 04:44.409
-Half a granola bar burger.
-Yeah, yeah, let's do that.

04:44.492 --> 04:45.493
That's a great idea.

04:45.577 --> 04:48.038
Great. I'll start chopping it up.
Ha! Ha! Ha!

04:48.121 --> 04:49.914
Oh, it's old. Oh, that's okay.
That's fine.

04:49.998 --> 04:52.250
-We can make it.
-Linda. Oh, my God, I wasn't serious.

04:52.334 --> 04:55.128
Look at the screen.
It says "Stupid Black Garlic Burger."

04:55.211 --> 04:57.172
I'm pretty sure we can't beat Skip Marooch

04:57.255 --> 05:00.091
if we don't have black garlic
on our black garlic burger.

05:00.175 --> 05:01.968
Okay. Geez.

05:02.052 --> 05:03.219
Kids. Kids, come here.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.221
The answer is yes, you look terrified.

05:05.305 --> 05:06.222
Is that the question?

05:06.306 --> 05:08.475
Listen. Gene, what did you do
with the black garlic?

05:08.558 --> 05:10.894
-It's not in the cooler.
-Calm down, Dad.

05:10.977 --> 05:12.520
What is black garlic?

05:12.604 --> 05:15.273
[groans] I need you guys to go back
to the restaurant,

05:15.357 --> 05:18.860
get the black garlic and bring it back
here as fast as you possibly can.

05:18.943 --> 05:21.279
No problem. It's on my way, anyway, bro.

05:21.363 --> 05:23.490
No, no.
Tina, Louise, go with your brother.

05:23.573 --> 05:25.700
And hurry. The clock is ticking.

05:25.784 --> 05:27.827
Let's talk more about this clock
that's ticking.

05:27.911 --> 05:29.621
-What do want, Louise?
-Tick, tick, tick.

05:29.704 --> 05:31.373
-Louise?
-We never have to work again.

05:31.456 --> 05:33.208
-You can have the day off tomorrow.
-Deal.

05:33.291 --> 05:35.543
-Great. Here.
-Ah! Don't throw things.

05:35.627 --> 05:37.837
-We don't throw things.
-We don't catch them, either.

05:37.921 --> 05:39.756
-We're not in the circus, Dad.
-Yeah.

05:39.839 --> 05:41.257
Just go!

05:42.467 --> 05:43.885
Hey, Belcher boppers.

05:43.968 --> 05:47.555
Mickey. Wait, you drive a pedicab?
I thought you worked at Wonder Wharf.

05:47.639 --> 05:50.600
Oh, I just started driving this
during festivals and weekends.

05:50.684 --> 05:53.311
Make a lot of money hauling around lazies
and drunks.

05:53.395 --> 05:55.230
We are both. Give us a ride.

05:55.313 --> 05:59.150
Hey, you kids don't want a ride
from toothpick legs over here.

05:59.234 --> 06:01.736
Check out these pedal monsters, huh?
[grunts]

06:01.820 --> 06:04.739
Wow, it looks like a bunch of snakes
inside a leather armchair.

06:04.823 --> 06:06.991
-Yup.
-Back off, Manny. This is my fare.

06:07.075 --> 06:09.786
Oh, yeah?
Well this is my turf, rookie. Here.

06:09.869 --> 06:11.246
Hey. My first turf war.

06:11.329 --> 06:13.957
-[grunting]
-[laughing] Whoa!

06:14.040 --> 06:15.583
-Hold on, let me...
-I think we'll go

06:15.667 --> 06:17.210
old-school pedestrian, see you guys.

06:17.293 --> 06:19.379
-Good luck with your turf war.
-Thanks. Whoa!

06:19.462 --> 06:20.839
So, Bob, you look sweaty.

06:20.922 --> 06:23.258
Think you have what it takes to beat
the competition?

06:23.341 --> 06:24.759
I'm not sweating.

06:24.843 --> 06:25.927
Oh, I am. Okay.

06:26.011 --> 06:27.345
I was just prepping.

06:27.429 --> 06:28.596
Normal, everything's fine.

06:28.680 --> 06:30.807
We've got all our ingredients, Chuck.
All of them.

06:30.890 --> 06:33.518
Totally boring.
I'm gonna go ahead and talk to Skip.

06:33.601 --> 06:34.853
Hello.

06:34.936 --> 06:37.689
Tell us more about your grandmother's
secret spice blend.

06:37.772 --> 06:39.774
All right, well, there is saffron in it.

06:39.858 --> 06:42.527
Oh, no, I told you the secret.
I have to kill you now.

06:42.610 --> 06:45.488
-Die, die, die!
-[laughing]

06:46.531 --> 06:48.575
Warm, charming, and funny,
strong hands, to boot.

06:48.658 --> 06:50.785
That's why he's got a book
and Bob doesn't.

06:51.244 --> 06:53.121
[suspenseful music playing]

06:53.204 --> 06:55.832
[Louise] Ah! There you are,
my stinky princess.

06:55.915 --> 06:58.251
We're getting you out of here.
Come with us.

06:58.335 --> 07:00.420
Hey, there's my back-scratching spatula.

07:00.503 --> 07:02.047
What are you doing in the kitchen?

07:02.130 --> 07:04.007
-Ah!
-Gene, you're crushing it.

07:04.090 --> 07:05.925
What? Oh, no. My shirt.

07:06.009 --> 07:08.261
-[groans]
-You just cost Dad the competition.

07:08.345 --> 07:10.680
Forget Dad. You just cost us our day off.

07:10.764 --> 07:13.558
Maybe it's still good.
I'll scrape it off with my back scratcher.

07:13.641 --> 07:15.852
Oh, it works on your front, too. Mm.

07:18.813 --> 07:21.775
What's so hard to understand about,
"I saw the black garlic,

07:21.858 --> 07:23.943
but then I saw my spatula back scratcher,

07:24.027 --> 07:26.738
and your black garlic got smeared
all over my belly?"

07:26.821 --> 07:29.240
Oh, my God.
Gene, put Tina on the phone.

07:29.324 --> 07:31.743
She's pretty big.
It'd be easier to put the phone on Tina.

07:31.826 --> 07:32.869
Gene.

07:33.745 --> 07:35.580
-This is Tina.
-Tina, listen to me.

07:35.663 --> 07:38.458
Go to your mom's bra drawer
and find the cash she thinks is secret.

07:38.541 --> 07:40.627
There's no money in there.
There's no money.

07:40.710 --> 07:43.755
Take $20 and go to that specialty
food market on Third.

07:43.838 --> 07:44.714
Uh, Fig Jam.

07:44.798 --> 07:47.550
[groans]
Aren't there any other places we could go?

07:47.634 --> 07:49.928
It's the only place in town
that has black garlic.

07:50.011 --> 07:51.638
Hurry. We're down to 12 minutes here.

07:52.347 --> 07:55.183
Dad hung up on me,
but it's okay because I know he loves me,

07:55.266 --> 07:57.811
and he says we have to go to Fig Jam.

07:57.894 --> 07:58.728
Fig Jam?

07:58.812 --> 07:59.938
Fig Jam.

08:01.523 --> 08:04.776
We'll take this dark chocolate bar
with bacon and red pepper flakes, please.

08:04.859 --> 08:06.695
Okay, that'll be $13.

08:06.778 --> 08:07.654
[in unison] What?

08:07.737 --> 08:09.072
[laughing]

08:09.155 --> 08:12.117
No, we're just getting one,
so this should cover it. Here you go.

08:12.200 --> 08:15.203
Mm-hm. You know, I think you three
may be in the wrong store.

08:15.286 --> 08:17.747
You'd be more comfortable shopping
at the gum ball machine.

08:17.831 --> 08:19.791
-At the gas station.
-Are you kicking us out?

08:19.874 --> 08:23.628
No. I am strongly suggesting that you take
your business elsewhere.

08:23.712 --> 08:24.879
What little of it you have.

08:24.963 --> 08:26.006
Hm. All right.

08:26.089 --> 08:29.384
But when a rich john sets me up in style,
I'm coming back.

08:29.467 --> 08:31.511
And you better hope you don't work
on commission.

08:31.594 --> 08:34.764
Yeah, where'd you import this chocolate
from anyway, your butt?

08:34.848 --> 08:36.224
-No.
-And where'd you import

08:36.307 --> 08:38.226
these sea salt caramel crisps
from, your butt?

08:38.309 --> 08:40.270
-Oh, Belgium.
-That's it. You're banned.

08:40.353 --> 08:42.355
We ban you. Get out of the store.

08:42.439 --> 08:45.025
-I will not get out of my store!
-You get out! You are banned!

08:45.108 --> 08:46.401
-You're banned!
-You're banned!

08:46.484 --> 08:48.486
-You're banned!
-You're banned!

08:48.570 --> 08:51.197
We have to try, guys.
If we don't get this black garlic,

08:51.281 --> 08:53.616
Dad is going to lose,
and our family will be dishonored.

08:53.700 --> 08:56.453
It's not like we've got a whole bunch
of honor to spare, is it?

08:56.536 --> 08:57.787
-No.
-Let's go.

08:59.039 --> 09:01.708
Oh, wow, Skip Marooch is cooking up
something special.

09:01.791 --> 09:04.753
It smells good and looks good doing it.
Scratch that. He looks great.

09:04.836 --> 09:05.712
Thank you.

09:05.795 --> 09:07.756
Moving on.
Let's see how Jimmy Pesto's doing.

09:07.839 --> 09:09.424
-Done. Ding.
-Oh, what?

09:09.507 --> 09:12.510
Wow, Jimmy has plated his burgers
with 10 minutes left.

09:12.594 --> 09:15.263
Those burgers may get cold
before the judges have a chance to...

09:15.347 --> 09:16.890
-Da-da-da.
-Oh, okay.

09:16.973 --> 09:20.143
-Brought a little heat lamp with him.
-Yeah. Heat lamp adds a little flavor.

09:20.226 --> 09:21.436
And it keeps my lizard warm.

09:21.519 --> 09:22.687
Would you? Come on.

09:22.771 --> 09:24.856
Let's check in on Bob,
because we kind of have to.

09:24.939 --> 09:25.857
Lots of chopping.

09:25.940 --> 09:27.734
His bald spot's getting bigger
and shinier.

09:27.817 --> 09:30.320
Hair falling out over his food.
What a disgusting creature.

09:30.403 --> 09:33.156
I'm catching all the hair
before it even comes close to the food.

09:33.239 --> 09:34.366
God, it is coming out.

09:34.449 --> 09:36.076
Your wife is a lucky woman, Bob.

09:36.159 --> 09:37.327
Thank you.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.497
-Maybe he won't recognize us.
-Banned!

09:40.580 --> 09:42.582
Whoa, hey, come on.
Let's not do this again.

09:42.665 --> 09:44.668
Let's start fresh.
What'd you say your name was?

09:44.751 --> 09:47.587
I didn't. It's none of your business.
Hey, don't look at my nametag.

09:47.671 --> 09:48.672
It's Ray. I saw it.

09:48.755 --> 09:50.215
Oh, Ray, I love that.

09:50.298 --> 09:51.925
Ray of sunshine. Ray of hope.

09:52.008 --> 09:55.345
We need some emergency black garlic,
it's a black garlic emergency.

09:55.428 --> 09:58.723
-Oh, a black garlic emergency.
-Yeah.

09:58.807 --> 10:01.434
-Well, in that case. No!
-So...

10:01.518 --> 10:03.103
A "no" is just a "yes" upside-down.

10:03.186 --> 10:04.396
-Get out.
-We'll pay double.

10:04.479 --> 10:05.313
-Really?
-Yes.

10:05.397 --> 10:06.648
All right, $16.

10:06.731 --> 10:08.566
That's the ray of greed I remember.

10:08.650 --> 10:10.527
Gene, where's the cash?
We gotta go. Come on.

10:10.610 --> 10:13.613
A cool older kid with a skateboard
asked me for a dollar.

10:13.697 --> 10:14.948
So, I gave him the 20

10:15.031 --> 10:16.866
and he's skating right back
with the change.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.743
-[groans]
-Gene, you fool.

10:18.827 --> 10:21.329
He's not coming back.
Never trust a boy with a skateboard.

10:21.413 --> 10:22.372
They're too fast.

10:22.455 --> 10:24.708
Hey, Ray, friend, uh, new plan.

10:24.791 --> 10:26.793
I'm gonna give you Gene,
and then I'll take--

10:26.876 --> 10:31.047
-Out now. Banned. Banned.
-Psst. Psst. Time for Operation

10:31.131 --> 10:32.966
-Black Garlic Down Freedom.
-What's that?

10:33.049 --> 10:34.592
[yelling]

10:34.676 --> 10:38.096
-Hey!
-We'll come back and pay for it later!

10:38.179 --> 10:39.806
Thanks for all your help, Ray!

10:39.889 --> 10:41.433
Get back here!

10:41.516 --> 10:44.352
[dramatic music playing]

10:46.688 --> 10:47.981
-Mickey.
-Hey, kids.

10:48.064 --> 10:49.149
-Hey.
-Hi, Ron.

10:49.232 --> 10:50.191
Hey, move over, buddy.

10:50.692 --> 10:53.069
Sorry, gang, I'm kind of in the middle
of a fare here.

10:53.153 --> 10:54.320
I was going to the library.

10:54.404 --> 10:56.364
Taking a pedicab there
is my weekly splurge.

10:56.448 --> 10:57.949
But we stole something.

10:58.033 --> 10:59.951
Oh, why didn't you say so? Where to?

11:00.035 --> 11:02.287
Take us to the food festival
and step on it.

11:02.370 --> 11:04.372
-[groans]
-[bike bell chimes]

11:04.998 --> 11:06.374
-Stop!
-Ho, ho, ho there, cowboy.

11:06.458 --> 11:08.668
I'll give 20 bucks
if you catch up to that pedicab.

11:08.752 --> 11:11.338
Wait, what? You mean that
spaghetti-legged fare thief?

11:11.421 --> 11:14.883
-Uh, yes.
-[laughs] Oh, baby.

11:14.966 --> 11:17.135
-Mickey, you are going down.
-Okay.

11:17.218 --> 11:19.929
Whoo! Let's get them. Whoa.

11:20.013 --> 11:21.639
[dramatic music playing]

11:21.723 --> 11:22.891
Let me hold the garlic.

11:22.974 --> 11:24.809
I wanna apologize
for murdering its brother.

11:24.893 --> 11:26.770
No, Gene.
I don't think that's a good idea.

11:26.853 --> 11:30.190
-Yeah, we're trying to get a day off here.
-Why can't I hold the black garlic?

11:30.273 --> 11:31.691
It's just that you always--

11:31.775 --> 11:34.527
I don't wanna say "screw everything up,"
but maybe Louise does?

11:34.611 --> 11:36.696
-You screw everything up.
-Wait, me?

11:36.780 --> 11:37.947
This Gene Belcher?

11:38.031 --> 11:39.783
It's just sometimes you lose focus.

11:39.866 --> 11:41.868
Your name is a verb in this family, Gene.

11:41.951 --> 11:43.286
We call it "Gene-ing out."

11:43.370 --> 11:45.497
I thought that meant
taking off your shorts

11:45.580 --> 11:47.123
-after a good meal.
-No.

11:47.207 --> 11:48.958
I was Gene-ing out
at work the other day.

11:49.042 --> 11:52.003
-I'm Gene-ing out right now.
-Mickey, no. Mickey, hey.

11:52.087 --> 11:54.589
You're taking us to the food festival
as fast you can.

11:54.673 --> 11:56.466
Oh, right, right, right.

11:57.592 --> 12:00.428
Oh, my God. I'm a verb. I'm a bad verb.

12:00.512 --> 12:01.471
You're a berb.

12:01.554 --> 12:02.847
I'm a berb.

12:02.931 --> 12:05.433
Eight minutes left
until burger judgment day.

12:05.517 --> 12:08.019
The kids should've been back by now.
We're screwed.

12:08.103 --> 12:09.646
Bob, you said you were Rocky.

12:09.729 --> 12:12.065
Come on. Start acting like Rocky.
Scream "Adrian."

12:12.148 --> 12:14.359
-I-- I don't wanna scream "Adrian."
-Scream "Adrian."

12:14.442 --> 12:16.528
Linda, that analogy doesn't work anymore.

12:16.611 --> 12:19.614
Rocky's son didn't leave
Rocky's boxing gloves at home.

12:19.698 --> 12:21.783
Yeah. Rocky's son, huh? Hm.

12:21.866 --> 12:25.829
-Well, maybe-- Eh, forget it.
-No, what? What were you gonna say?

12:25.912 --> 12:28.456
I'm just saying,
you picked our least responsible kid

12:28.540 --> 12:29.874
to do the most important thing.

12:29.958 --> 12:32.085
Maybe you kind of
expected him to screw up.

12:32.168 --> 12:35.005
-[scoffs] That is ridiculous, Lin.
-Well...

12:35.088 --> 12:37.549
Forgetting the garlic
lets you off the hook for losing.

12:37.632 --> 12:38.758
Like it's not your fault.

12:38.842 --> 12:41.594
All of a sudden, you got a built-in excuse
for not being the best.

12:41.678 --> 12:44.556
-That is crazy. That's-- maybe right?
-[cell phone buzzes]

12:44.639 --> 12:45.473
Oh, my God.

12:45.557 --> 12:51.771
Oh, it's the kids. "Got garlic. Broke law.
You fix later. On our way. 'Smiley face.'"

12:51.855 --> 12:52.689
Smiley face.

12:52.772 --> 12:53.982
Oh, my God. They got it.

12:54.065 --> 12:56.276
They're coming.
We're gonna have everything we need.

12:56.359 --> 12:57.819
-No more excuses.
-No.

12:57.902 --> 12:58.737
I'm terrified.

12:58.820 --> 13:03.116
-So I was ri...
-Linda, you were right.

13:03.199 --> 13:06.911
Yes. Right. Me.
You don't have to say that.

13:06.995 --> 13:09.539
It's Ray, and he's either
getting bigger or closer.

13:09.622 --> 13:11.416
Uh-oh. He's got Manny driving him.

13:11.499 --> 13:14.210
Don't worry, I'll slow him down. [grunts]

13:14.294 --> 13:16.087
Oh, that was overdue. Why did I do that?

13:16.171 --> 13:18.506
Eh, they're throwing stuff at us.

13:18.590 --> 13:20.050
No throwsies, man.

13:20.133 --> 13:21.468
Yeah. No throwsies.

13:21.551 --> 13:23.303
We gotta get this to dad.

13:23.386 --> 13:25.555
Go. Go. Get him. Faster.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.140
-Faster.
-I am going.

13:28.058 --> 13:30.810
I just want you kids to know,
I will fight.

13:30.894 --> 13:32.854
I will fight Manny or Ray,

13:32.937 --> 13:36.024
but I-- I prefer to fight Ray, actually,
because he's smaller.

13:36.107 --> 13:37.817
-Nice. Thanks, Ron.
-No problem.

13:37.901 --> 13:39.235
There's the contest.

13:39.319 --> 13:41.529
Mickey, pedal harder.
Mow these people down.

13:41.613 --> 13:43.031
Oh, no, a train.

13:43.114 --> 13:44.407
Beat it, Mickey. Beat it.

13:49.913 --> 13:52.082
-[yells] Damn it!
-No!

13:52.165 --> 13:53.500
[gasping]

13:53.583 --> 13:55.627
Sorry, kids.
You're gonna have to run from here.

13:55.710 --> 13:59.047
You stay here and block. I'll cut through
the crowd like a fart through butter.

13:59.130 --> 14:01.591
Let me take the garlic. I need this.

14:01.675 --> 14:03.218
This is my redemption song.

14:03.301 --> 14:04.803
Bob Marley, give me strength.

14:04.886 --> 14:07.389
This is a food festival, Gene.

14:07.472 --> 14:09.474
It's a distraction minefield for you.

14:09.557 --> 14:11.434
Yeah, Gene.
Stay here and help me block Ray.

14:11.518 --> 14:12.560
It'll be a block party.

14:12.644 --> 14:16.356
Okay. Hey, look, that cloud looks like
a dinosaur on a thing.

14:16.439 --> 14:17.357
-Where?
-Huh?

14:18.191 --> 14:19.859
[groans] I can't believe it.

14:19.943 --> 14:21.569
Gene made us Gene out.

14:21.653 --> 14:23.154
Oh, yeah, I see it.

14:28.868 --> 14:31.371
Okay, Gene. Get this black garlic to Dad.

14:31.454 --> 14:32.580
Don't lose focus.

14:32.664 --> 14:34.916
Muffins. No, don't lose focus.

14:37.043 --> 14:39.421
Hi. I'm Ron. I'm blocking you.

14:39.504 --> 14:41.464
-Where are those kids?
-[Tina] Oh, you mean us?

14:41.548 --> 14:43.008
Meet your new cankles, Ray.

14:43.091 --> 14:44.426
-Hi.
-Where's the black garlic?

14:44.509 --> 14:48.013
You'll never get it. It's too far away,
and as we've already said, you're cankled.

14:48.096 --> 14:49.681
Don't you cankle me.

14:49.764 --> 14:50.640
These are good.

14:50.724 --> 14:52.851
These are gonna be good.
Linda, be my eyes.

14:52.934 --> 14:54.894
-You see the kids out there?
-No, I don't.

14:54.978 --> 14:57.564
What do they look like?
Oh, God. I'm panicking. I'm panicking.

14:57.647 --> 14:58.982
[panting]

14:59.065 --> 15:02.736
Free cupcake-flavored ice cream,
served on a waffle.

15:02.819 --> 15:04.571
You're killing me!

15:04.654 --> 15:06.072
Pizza tacos.

15:06.156 --> 15:07.240
Pizza tacos?

15:07.323 --> 15:10.076
-Ten for 1 dollar.
-Don't you tell me "10 for 1 dollar."

15:10.160 --> 15:11.995
-[buzzing]
-[yells]

15:12.078 --> 15:15.665
Robot cake, release your hold on me.

15:15.749 --> 15:18.710
So, uh, you work at Fig Jam, huh?

15:18.793 --> 15:20.420
I-- I-- I heard you had great fig jam.

15:20.503 --> 15:21.921
Oh, yes, it's delicious.

15:22.005 --> 15:24.674
And you'll never know,
because you're banned!

15:24.758 --> 15:26.343
-Oh.
-Hey, wait a minute.

15:26.426 --> 15:28.303
Is anyone even watching Fig Jam right now?

15:28.386 --> 15:30.305
Ray, people are probably looting it.

15:30.388 --> 15:32.807
A bunch of hippies
stuffing truffled cheese

15:32.891 --> 15:34.267
in their banjo cases.

15:34.351 --> 15:35.268
Hello?

15:36.186 --> 15:37.187
Hello?

15:37.854 --> 15:39.939
I'm just gonna leave money
on the counter.

15:40.023 --> 15:41.024
Love your store.

15:41.107 --> 15:43.526
Oh, my God. Fig Jam. Fig Jam.

15:43.610 --> 15:46.154
That was some mean pedi-cabbing
out there, rookie.

15:46.237 --> 15:48.865
You got the legs of a mouse
but the heart of a lion.

15:48.948 --> 15:51.826
My uncle's got the heart of a lion.
He got it in Thailand.

15:51.910 --> 15:53.203
-Thailand, huh?
-Yeah.

15:53.286 --> 15:55.038
They got nice ties in Thailand?

15:55.121 --> 15:56.289
I love you, Manny.

15:56.373 --> 15:58.875
[panting] I'm almost there.

15:59.626 --> 16:01.544
Hot Fudge Car Wash.

16:01.628 --> 16:05.465
[in slow motion] Hot Fudge Car Wash?

16:05.548 --> 16:09.177
No...

16:09.260 --> 16:10.929
[sobbing]

16:11.012 --> 16:12.764
Oh, it's Gene. Bob, it's Gene.

16:12.847 --> 16:14.432
-Dad!
-Gene.

16:14.516 --> 16:17.102
I-- I'm sorry I screwed up today. I--

16:17.185 --> 16:19.604
I'm sorry I screw up all the time.

16:19.688 --> 16:21.481
No, Gene, you didn't screw up.

16:21.564 --> 16:23.274
I screwed up by trusting you.

16:23.358 --> 16:24.693
Wait, that came out wrong.

16:24.776 --> 16:27.404
I'm confused,
are you trying to make me feel better?

16:27.487 --> 16:28.780
Yes, I am.

16:28.863 --> 16:33.284
Before I give you the black garlic,
I just wanna say one more thing.

16:33.368 --> 16:36.538
-There's only 45 seconds left, Gene, so...
-I've always admired you.

16:36.621 --> 16:39.249
Just give me the garlic, Gene.
We'll talk later.

16:39.332 --> 16:40.542
-Okay.
-Thank you.

16:40.625 --> 16:41.584
Sorry I snapped.

16:41.668 --> 16:44.671
Come on, Bobby. You got your gloves,
now time to beat Apollo.

16:44.754 --> 16:47.757
-Adrian!
-No, not like that. Say it right.

16:47.841 --> 16:49.384
What? I'm saying it right.

16:49.467 --> 16:51.344
Adri-- I don't have time, Lin.

16:51.428 --> 16:53.596
Ten seconds left.
Some cooks might not make it.

16:53.680 --> 16:56.933
-I'm talking about Bob.
-[crowd] Ten, nine, eight,

16:57.017 --> 17:00.520
-seven. Six. Five...
-I got everything ready. Here we go.

17:00.603 --> 17:02.105
Four...

17:02.772 --> 17:03.773

17:09.738 --> 17:11.114
[timer buzzes]

17:11.197 --> 17:12.949
Time's up. Hand off your meat, chefs.

17:13.033 --> 17:14.284
We finished.

17:14.367 --> 17:16.036
We finished the burgers.

17:16.119 --> 17:17.287
Hooray for Bob.

17:17.370 --> 17:19.873
He managed to somehow
do what he does for a living.

17:19.956 --> 17:21.791
-What a champion.
-That's my Bobby.

17:21.875 --> 17:26.087
Chefs, present your burgers to the judges.

17:26.796 --> 17:29.007
The judges are tasting
Jimmy Pesto's burger first.

17:29.090 --> 17:31.134
Let's see how he--
Oh, they are spitting it out.

17:31.217 --> 17:32.177
Oh, it's cool.

17:32.260 --> 17:34.637
-[groans]
-Hey, two-for-one pizza night

17:34.721 --> 17:37.223
Wednesdays, karaoke Tuesdays,
trivia Thursdays.

17:37.307 --> 17:38.975
We never card. Come on down.

17:39.059 --> 17:40.935
Thank you, Jimmy.
Spitting it out, bad sign.

17:41.019 --> 17:43.438
-You can probably go.
-Ah, come on, Trev.

17:43.521 --> 17:46.107
-[groans]
-Hey, I'm sorry I was so hard on you.

17:46.191 --> 17:49.527
Things got a little heated.
And not just because of your heat lamp.

17:49.611 --> 17:52.614
-Ah! You said "hard." Oh!
-I did. Up top.

17:52.697 --> 17:55.825
Now they're tasting Bob's idiot burger.
Get ready for another spit-out.

17:57.285 --> 18:00.372
This is fantastic.

18:00.455 --> 18:05.543
The meat is seasoned perfectly,
and this black garlic is-- Oh, oh...

18:05.627 --> 18:09.297
This has exquisite mouth feel.

18:09.381 --> 18:12.550
Bobby, they loved it.
That one's creepy, but he loved it.

18:12.634 --> 18:14.803
Oh, my God. Did we just win?
They still haven't

18:14.886 --> 18:17.639
-had Skip's burger, but--
-Now the last, but most likely the best,

18:17.722 --> 18:19.432
from the Cinnamon Stallion,
Skip Marooch.

18:19.516 --> 18:22.394
This is amazing.

18:22.477 --> 18:25.980
This chutney is absolutely, mmm, oh...

18:26.064 --> 18:29.109
Exceptional mouth feel.

18:29.192 --> 18:31.903
Hm. It might be a little closer
than I thought.

18:31.986 --> 18:33.488
Okay. Okay, Bob.

18:33.571 --> 18:35.323
You got a "fantastic" and an "ooh,"

18:35.407 --> 18:37.534
but he got an "amazing"
and a really weird moan.

18:37.617 --> 18:40.704
And he liked both your mouth feels.
I'd say it's a tight race.

18:40.787 --> 18:43.957
[Chuck] Now the judges will deliberate.
Cue deliberating music, please.

18:44.040 --> 18:46.543
You know what? I did my best,
I held my own with Skip,

18:46.626 --> 18:49.212
and no matter what happens, Lin,
I feel pretty good.

18:49.295 --> 18:50.714
And the winner is Skip Marooch.

18:50.797 --> 18:54.467
-Oh, my God, I feel bad.
-Damn it. Piece of garbage.

18:54.551 --> 18:57.303
-How could we lose? Are you kidding me?
-Okay. Okay.

18:57.387 --> 19:00.265
Ha! It's shaped like a burger. I get it.

19:00.348 --> 19:01.516
I'm so excited.

19:01.599 --> 19:04.019
Skip Marooch, handsomest chef.

19:04.102 --> 19:05.145
What about me?

19:05.228 --> 19:06.312
Great emcee.

19:06.396 --> 19:09.691
Gonna go have a plate of shrimp,
a 20-ounce beer,

19:09.774 --> 19:13.153
and a massage from my friend,
Hank the masseuse!

19:13.236 --> 19:14.070
Oh, my God.

19:14.487 --> 19:15.655
[Gene] Sorry you lost, Dad.

19:15.739 --> 19:18.366
Maybe if I'd gotten you the garlic sooner,
you would have won.

19:18.450 --> 19:21.911
No, no. We made the best burger we could,
but we lost, and that's okay.

19:21.995 --> 19:23.079
I don't need an excuse.

19:23.163 --> 19:26.041
I guess Skip was just more
charismatic and likable, Dad.

19:26.124 --> 19:28.209
That's right. No. I don't need an excuse.

19:28.293 --> 19:29.711
Either way, I'm sorry.

19:29.794 --> 19:30.628
Listen, Gene.

19:30.712 --> 19:34.674
You may get distracted from time to time,
but I love you and I love who you are.

19:34.758 --> 19:37.052
And what matters most is-- Gene?

19:37.135 --> 19:40.263
-Gene, are you listening?
-I am. I am. I love you. I love you, too.

19:40.347 --> 19:43.308
But what are those people doing
waiting in front of the restaurant?

19:43.391 --> 19:47.187
-Hm. People don't wait for our restaurant.
-Maybe they need to use the bathroom.

19:47.270 --> 19:48.772
Hey, get out of here!

19:48.855 --> 19:50.899
Go pee in the bushes like normal people.

19:50.982 --> 19:53.610
Are you guys open?
We wanna try that black garlic burger.

19:53.693 --> 19:55.320
Can I have a black garlic burger, too?

19:55.403 --> 19:56.654
-Skip?
-Yeah.

19:56.738 --> 19:57.572
What the hell?

19:57.655 --> 19:59.157
You wanna try my burger?

19:59.240 --> 20:02.535
Yeah, I smelt it,
and now I want you to dealt it.

20:02.619 --> 20:03.495
Into my mouth.

20:03.578 --> 20:06.915
Come on in. We just need a few minutes
to get the grill going.

20:06.998 --> 20:09.250
Gene, you wanna go start the grill?

20:09.334 --> 20:11.252
Nope. My day off starts now.

20:11.336 --> 20:15.882
And I will be spending the next 24 hours
at the Hot Fudge Car Wash. Bye-bye.

20:15.965 --> 20:16.800
-Gene.
-Yeah?

20:16.883 --> 20:19.469
-Did you just say "Hot Fudge Car Wash"?
-I did.

20:19.552 --> 20:21.096
My day off starts now, too. Bye-bye.

20:21.179 --> 20:22.681
Whoa, wait. We have customers.

20:22.764 --> 20:25.392
Sorry, Dad. I have to go see
a car wash about a fudge.
