WEBVTT

00:00.036 --> 00:01.349
<i>Previously on "Suits"...</i>

00:01.350 --> 00:03.615
You think that I don't know
that all your problems

00:03.715 --> 00:05.326
are solved if I tell them
that Harvey did this?

00:05.426 --> 00:07.951
I would be lying if I said
it didn't cross my mind

00:08.051 --> 00:10.119
that maybe Mike should think
about making a deal.

00:10.219 --> 00:12.273
And now that they've taken in
your father, you can't tell me

00:12.373 --> 00:14.013
that the thought
hasn't crossed yours too.

00:14.064 --> 00:16.605
Thinking about it and talking
about it aren't the same thing.

00:16.705 --> 00:19.823
I got a call about an article
on Mike Ross' meteoric rise

00:19.875 --> 00:21.291
to Junior Partner.

00:21.327 --> 00:23.577
The problem is
there is no Mike Ross.

00:23.629 --> 00:25.162
You reported it
anonymously,

00:25.214 --> 00:26.580
because you didn't want
to look bad.

00:26.632 --> 00:28.382
I reported it anonymously

00:28.417 --> 00:30.584
because I was ashamed
that it happened on my watch.

00:30.636 --> 00:32.753
I loved you, and you let
some stupid secret

00:32.755 --> 00:34.888
come between us because
you couldn't trust me with it.

00:34.924 --> 00:37.391
All you have to do
is admit what you did,

00:37.426 --> 00:38.926
and all of this goes away.

00:38.928 --> 00:40.594
Sheila came forward.

00:40.646 --> 00:42.729
She admitted she was the one
who wrote the e-mail.

00:42.765 --> 00:45.265
You and your partners
are hereby subpoenaed

00:45.267 --> 00:48.735
to hand over every single
document in the entire firm.

00:52.024 --> 00:53.907
Harvey, I'm not sure
this is the best idea.

00:53.943 --> 00:56.577
We need to know what she has.
What's the downside?

00:56.612 --> 00:58.495
The downside is
that we move up the trial.

00:58.531 --> 01:01.415
Mike, this trial's coming,
whether we like it or not.

01:01.450 --> 01:03.617
And the more time we have
knowing her game plan,

01:03.669 --> 01:07.204
the better off we'll be.

01:07.256 --> 01:09.289
Holy shit.
What?

01:09.291 --> 01:11.125
I took the LSATs
with this guy.

01:11.177 --> 01:12.626
So what?

01:12.628 --> 01:15.129
So he can give Gibbs something
she doesn't even have on me yet.

01:15.131 --> 01:17.548
Yes, but to do that, he'd
be ruining his whole career.

01:17.600 --> 01:19.383
Which means, even
if he remembers you,

01:19.435 --> 01:21.051
he's more afraid of you
than you are of him.

01:21.103 --> 01:23.437
So calm the hell down.

01:23.472 --> 01:25.389
All right, let's make
this quick.

01:25.441 --> 01:26.974
Your Honor,
making it quick is exactly

01:27.026 --> 01:28.642
what we're asking you to do.

01:28.644 --> 01:30.477
She hasn't handed over
her discovery yet.

01:30.479 --> 01:32.112
I'm still building a case,

01:32.148 --> 01:33.947
and we haven't even set
a date for the trial yet.

01:33.983 --> 01:35.983
And the check's in the mail,
and all the other things

01:36.035 --> 01:38.535
people say when they don't wanna
do what they have to do.

01:38.571 --> 01:40.091
What I have to do
is protect the public

01:40.122 --> 01:42.002
from the likes of you.
All right, that's enough.

01:42.041 --> 01:43.824
Get that discovery to them
by the end of the day.

01:43.876 --> 01:45.993
In that case, we'd like to ask
that the day of the trial

01:45.995 --> 01:47.544
be set in the next two weeks.

01:47.580 --> 01:49.796
Objection, Your Honor,
she's had weeks to--

01:49.832 --> 01:51.665
You can't have it both ways,
Mr. Specter.

01:51.667 --> 01:54.384
You can't demand discovery
and ask for more time.

01:54.420 --> 01:56.003
Trial starts in two weeks.

01:59.475 --> 02:01.308
Jessica, we have
a problem.

02:01.343 --> 02:02.703
Thanks for pointing
that out, Jack.

02:02.728 --> 02:04.011
I had no idea.

02:04.063 --> 02:05.479
I'm not talking
about the trial.

02:05.514 --> 02:06.847
I'm talking about this.

02:06.899 --> 02:07.981
What the hell is that?

02:08.017 --> 02:10.267
An Op-Ed in the Journal.

02:10.318 --> 02:12.686
"There is no way
on God's green Earth

02:12.738 --> 02:15.355
"that at least one
of the three name partners

02:15.407 --> 02:17.558
"at Pearson Specter Litt

02:17.593 --> 02:21.445
didn't know what was going on
under their own roof."

02:21.497 --> 02:24.665
"God's green Earth."
Who wrote it?

02:24.700 --> 02:25.999
A partner at Skaaden.

02:26.035 --> 02:27.501
If it wasn't them,
it would've been someone else,

02:27.536 --> 02:29.703
because they smell blood.
I don't care what they smell.

02:29.755 --> 02:31.538
I've given up everything
for this firm,

02:31.540 --> 02:33.290
and if anybody tries
to take it from me,

02:33.342 --> 02:36.376
they'll have to pry it
from my cold, dead hands.

02:36.378 --> 02:38.545
- And what's your goddamn plan?
- Excuse me?

02:38.597 --> 02:40.547
Jessica, our reputation's
taking a beating.

02:40.599 --> 02:41.715
We need to rehabilitate it.

02:41.767 --> 02:43.767
That means pro Bono,
and you know it.

02:43.802 --> 02:46.136
One free case is not going
to move the needle,

02:46.188 --> 02:47.387
no matter how worthy it is.

02:47.389 --> 02:48.722
I'm not talking
about one case.

02:48.724 --> 02:50.390
I'm talking about
a series of cases

02:50.442 --> 02:53.277
for our clients'
most valued charities.

02:54.980 --> 02:57.447
Oh, this better not be
another scheme, Jack.

02:57.483 --> 02:58.782
You think this is a move?

02:58.817 --> 03:00.784
Now why would I ever
think that after you tried

03:00.819 --> 03:04.238
to take my firm from me six
times in the last ten minutes?

03:04.240 --> 03:05.872
I did try
to take over from you.

03:05.908 --> 03:08.625
But I've been at this firm
my entire career,

03:08.661 --> 03:10.210
and I am fighting for it now.

03:10.246 --> 03:11.995
- And you think I'm not?
- I'm sure you are.

03:12.047 --> 03:14.167
But you're also the reason
I'm holding this indictment

03:14.216 --> 03:15.382
of our firm
in the first place,

03:15.417 --> 03:17.134
because what they're
saying is true.

03:17.169 --> 03:18.635
And don't you dare
try to tell me

03:18.671 --> 03:19.886
you didn't know
about Mike Ross,

03:19.922 --> 03:21.755
because we both know you did.

What the hell do you want?

03:32.601 --> 03:34.484
Oh, since you made me come
all the way down here,

03:34.520 --> 03:36.937
I thought I'd save the taxpayers
some money on hiring a server.

03:36.939 --> 03:38.272
A server for what?

03:38.324 --> 03:40.440
For your fiancée. I'd like
to ask her some questions.

03:40.442 --> 03:41.742
Get the hell out of here.

03:41.777 --> 03:43.777
You want to serve a subpoena,
you serve it to her.

03:43.829 --> 03:45.946
Well, then I wouldn't get
to see the look on your face.

03:45.948 --> 03:48.081
Did you really think I wouldn't
hit you where it hurts?

03:48.117 --> 03:50.834
I was saving
your weakest spot for last.

03:50.869 --> 03:52.336
Have a nice day, gentlemen.

03:56.925 --> 03:59.543
- What?
- You know what.

03:59.595 --> 04:01.712
It's time we give that woman
a taste of her own medicine.

04:01.764 --> 04:03.297
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

04:03.299 --> 04:05.215
It means we hire a lawyer
from an outside firm,

04:05.267 --> 04:07.134
and we dig up dirt on someone
she cares about.

04:07.186 --> 04:09.303
- Are you out of your mind?
- You saw what she did to Donna.

04:09.355 --> 04:11.271
It's only a matter of time
before she tries to pull

04:11.307 --> 04:12.773
the same shit with Rachel.
Mike--

04:12.808 --> 04:14.441
Harvey, you're the one
that taught me that when someone

04:14.476 --> 04:16.192
puts pressure on you,
you put it back on them.

04:16.228 --> 04:18.028
I also taught you if you're
gonna take a swing at someone,

04:18.063 --> 04:20.279
you better knock them out,
and if we pull the shit

04:20.315 --> 04:21.947
that you're talking about
and get caught,

04:21.983 --> 04:24.701
all that happens is
I get thrown off this case,

04:24.737 --> 04:26.703
and it's game over.

04:26.739 --> 04:28.622
Harvey, I can't stand by
and watch while the people

04:28.657 --> 04:30.657
I care about get attacked,
and neither could you.

04:30.709 --> 04:31.992
Mike, I promise you,

04:32.044 --> 04:33.910
I will be there for Rachel
every step of the way.

04:33.962 --> 04:35.295
In the meantime,

04:35.331 --> 04:37.831
I need you going through
every one of those boxes.

04:37.883 --> 04:39.750
Because if that woman
is ready to go to trial,

04:39.802 --> 04:41.501
she's got a lot more
than an e-mail

04:41.553 --> 04:44.104

Yes, I know who you are.

05:21.083 --> 05:23.367
I'm flattered you came
for me personally.

05:23.419 --> 05:25.535
But we aren't supposed to talk
for another three days,

05:25.537 --> 05:27.037
and I don't have my lawyer
with me, so--

05:27.089 --> 05:28.839
This isn't
a formal interrogation.

05:28.874 --> 05:30.040
That won't be necessary.

05:30.092 --> 05:32.376
Then I'll tell you
what is necessary.

05:32.428 --> 05:34.211
You're going to put in writing
that anything I say to you

05:34.213 --> 05:35.379
is inadmissible.

05:35.431 --> 05:37.047
I suspected you'd
say that, which is why

05:37.049 --> 05:41.468
I prepared this.

05:41.520 --> 05:44.471
I understand if you'd prefer
to ask somebody who's actually

05:44.523 --> 05:48.392
completed law school
if that's legally binding.

05:48.444 --> 05:50.193
I'm perfectly capable
of determining

05:50.229 --> 05:52.729
if this is legally
binding or not.

05:52.731 --> 05:54.114
and I'm not going to let you

05:54.149 --> 05:56.483
bait me into saying
anything to you.

05:56.535 --> 05:57.567
Well, that's fine with me.

05:57.569 --> 05:59.736
I'm not looking for you to talk.

05:59.738 --> 06:01.488
I'm looking for you to listen.

06:09.415 --> 06:10.414
Well, it's official.

06:10.416 --> 06:11.632
No matter what
happens at trial,

06:11.667 --> 06:13.417
this firm isn't surviving
Mike Ross.

06:13.419 --> 06:15.085
I know about
the editorial, Louis.

06:15.087 --> 06:16.420
What editorial?

06:16.422 --> 06:19.556
I'm talking about the summer
associate applications.

06:19.591 --> 06:20.757
- How bad is it?
- Three people.

06:20.809 --> 06:22.926
Not just any three people,
the three people that never

06:22.928 --> 06:24.811
should've made it to Harvard
in the first place.

06:24.847 --> 06:26.263
Goddamn it.

06:26.265 --> 06:28.315
Sheila's sending us
the bottom of the barrel.

06:28.350 --> 06:30.100
She's giving us
the sludge that grows

06:30.102 --> 06:34.237
at the bottom of the barrel.
Then...

06:34.273 --> 06:38.775
I think it might be time to
start looking beyond Harvard.

06:38.777 --> 06:40.610
Yeah, that's a great idea.
You know what?

06:40.663 --> 06:41.611
We should start shitting
in the urinals

06:41.613 --> 06:42.612
while we're at it.

06:42.614 --> 06:43.697
I'm not talking about

06:43.749 --> 06:45.615
the University
of Arizona, Louis.

06:45.617 --> 06:48.618
I'm talking about Columbia,
Yale, Stanford--

06:48.620 --> 06:51.121
And I'm talking
about appearances.

06:51.123 --> 06:53.590
We break our rule and suddenly
hire outside of Harvard--

06:53.625 --> 06:56.126
We already broke our rule
for Rachel with Columbia.

06:56.178 --> 06:57.961
Please, that was different,
and you know it.

06:57.963 --> 06:59.763
No. It was because of Mike,

06:59.798 --> 07:02.015
which makes it the same
goddamn thing.

07:02.051 --> 07:04.968
One way or another, we are
going to keep this firm going.

07:04.970 --> 07:07.304
So if you don't wanna go
outside of Harvard to do that,

07:07.356 --> 07:10.140
then I suggest you go up
to Cambridge,

07:10.192 --> 07:11.808
and convince Sheila
to start feeding us

07:11.860 --> 07:13.977
some worthy
goddamn applicants.

07:24.039 --> 07:25.572
What can I say?
I do my homework.

07:25.624 --> 07:27.407
As do I, Ms. Gibbs,
which is why I'm not falling

07:27.459 --> 07:28.825
for you pretending

07:28.827 --> 07:30.243
You're right.
I'm not your friend.

07:45.677 --> 07:46.760
I know my options.

07:46.812 --> 07:48.562
Then you know you have

Or I can say that
he didn't do this.

07:55.771 --> 07:57.988
Perjuring yourself is

08:02.528 --> 08:04.368
the character and fitness
committee of the Bar,

08:04.413 --> 08:06.079
and I seriously doubt they're
going to admit somebody

08:06.115 --> 08:07.197
who did that.

08:07.249 --> 08:08.448
Are you trying to
intimidate a witness?

08:08.500 --> 08:12.202
Because yes, someday
I will face that committee,

08:12.204 --> 08:14.538
but tomorrow they're going
to be hearing about you.

08:14.540 --> 08:17.124
I'm your only way
out of this mess.

08:17.176 --> 08:20.377
Just give me the people who are
actually responsible for it,

08:20.429 --> 08:23.430
and I'll see to it that both
you and Mike can practice law

08:23.465 --> 08:24.931
for the rest of your lives.

08:32.808 --> 08:34.224
Please tell me
that's the last one.

08:34.226 --> 08:35.609
It is.

08:35.644 --> 08:37.861
Except for the hundred
in the other conference room.

08:37.895 --> 08:39.563
- Holy shit.
- Yeah.

08:39.565 --> 08:41.398
Trial Strategy 101.

08:41.400 --> 08:42.948
Bury the other side
in paperwork,

08:42.985 --> 08:44.785
so they can't find
what they're looking for.

08:44.820 --> 08:46.069
And what are we looking for?

08:46.071 --> 08:47.904
Gibbs' trial strategy.

08:47.906 --> 08:50.624
Somewhere in these boxes
are the pieces

08:50.659 --> 08:52.626
that she is putting together
to make her case.

08:52.661 --> 08:54.077
We find them,
we know specifically

08:54.079 --> 08:55.412
what we have to fight.

08:55.464 --> 08:59.166
And what specifically might
those things look like?

08:59.218 --> 09:02.919
Witness lists, interviews,
anything to do with Lola Jensen,

09:02.971 --> 09:05.138
utility bills from when I was
supposed to be at Harvard--

09:05.174 --> 09:06.923
Wait, wait, wait.
Slow down.

09:06.975 --> 09:09.342
- Why are you writing this down?
- So I can remember it.

09:09.394 --> 09:11.595
And because we need a system.

09:11.647 --> 09:14.097
And because you've never done
doc review before.

09:15.317 --> 09:16.433
I don't believe it.

09:16.435 --> 09:17.934
How you've been a legal
secretary this long,

09:17.986 --> 09:20.070
and never have done doc review.
I will tell you how.

09:20.105 --> 09:22.272
Because I'm the best damn person
you've ever seen

09:22.274 --> 09:24.157
at reading people,
anticipating needs,

09:24.193 --> 09:25.742
and generally
dominating everything.

09:25.777 --> 09:26.860
So, in this situation,

09:26.912 --> 09:28.612
you're going to be
absolutely no help at all.

09:28.664 --> 09:30.447
- None whatsoever.
- I'm getting Rachel.

09:35.037 --> 09:36.503
What's that?

09:36.538 --> 09:37.704
What does it look like?

09:37.756 --> 09:39.556
It looks like something
I don't have time for.

09:39.591 --> 09:40.957
Well, make time.

09:40.959 --> 09:43.677
Jessica, we've got a thousand
boxes of shit to go through,

09:43.712 --> 09:45.879
and I've got trial in two weeks.
What?

09:45.931 --> 09:47.597
That's right.
The date's been set.

09:47.633 --> 09:49.266
So I'm sorry that I can't have
a doughnut with you right now,

09:49.301 --> 09:51.017
but I've got something a little
more important to deal with.

09:51.053 --> 09:53.470
Harvey, I understand, but
our clients are being circled.

09:53.522 --> 09:54.638
Our reputation's getting
tanked,

09:54.690 --> 09:56.556
and we're getting sent
shit associates.

09:56.608 --> 09:57.974
And Mike Ross
is facing prison.

09:57.976 --> 10:00.026
And you're handling
one thing,

10:00.062 --> 10:02.229
while I'm handling
everything else.

10:02.281 --> 10:03.980
- Jessica--
- No, never mind, Harvey.

10:03.982 --> 10:06.816
It's clear that you
really don't care

10:06.818 --> 10:08.285
about keeping
this firm together.

10:08.320 --> 10:09.903
I resigned to keep
this firm together.

10:09.955 --> 10:11.621
Well, it sure doesn't seem
to be working out that way,

10:11.657 --> 10:13.206
does it?

10:17.296 --> 10:20.964
Great, I'll have my secretary
set up a meeting for Monday.

10:20.999 --> 10:23.083
If that meeting's about your
pro Bono bullshit,

10:23.135 --> 10:24.384
cancel it.
What?

10:24.419 --> 10:27.721
You said it yourself, Jack.
Other firms smell blood.

10:27.756 --> 10:30.757
Well, you don't get a shark
to back off by playing nice,

10:30.809 --> 10:33.176
you do it by clubbing him
in the face.

10:33.228 --> 10:35.428
They come after our clients,
we go after theirs.

10:35.480 --> 10:37.314
Clients aren't the ones
writing editorials

10:37.349 --> 10:39.983
for "The Wall Street
Journal", Jack.

10:40.018 --> 10:41.518
You want to poach
an attorney.

10:41.520 --> 10:44.437
I wanna poach
a whole goddamn department.

10:44.489 --> 10:46.156
That is definitely
another way to go.

10:46.191 --> 10:47.691
It's the only way to go,

10:47.743 --> 10:50.110
because if we didn't do what
we're saying we didn't do,

10:50.162 --> 10:51.995
this is what we do.
I get it.

10:52.030 --> 10:54.414
You're trying to convince
the world we're innocent.

10:54.449 --> 10:56.700
Jack, I don't give a shit
if my enemies think

10:56.752 --> 10:58.118
I'm innocent or not.

10:58.170 --> 11:01.454
I give a shit whether they
think they can take me down,

11:01.506 --> 11:02.789
which is why
I'm not going to cower

11:02.841 --> 11:05.208
in some pro Bono corner,
trying to convince them

11:05.210 --> 11:06.626
that I'm friendly.

11:06.678 --> 11:08.962
I'm going to kick some ass,

11:09.014 --> 11:11.798
and remind them
that I'm fierce.

11:18.724 --> 11:20.357
[door opening and closing]

11:20.392 --> 11:22.475
There you are. I've been
looking everywhere for you.

11:22.527 --> 11:25.111
Rachel, we need your help.
Where have you been?

11:25.147 --> 11:26.279
With Anita Gibbs.

11:26.315 --> 11:27.781
What? How did you
let that happen?

11:27.816 --> 11:29.482
Because she ambushed me
on the street,

11:29.534 --> 11:30.900
with a document that said
our conversation

11:30.953 --> 11:32.235
would be inadmissible.

11:32.287 --> 11:33.570
And if she did that
is because she didn't want

11:33.622 --> 11:35.205
to talk to you, she wanted
to get in your head.

11:35.240 --> 11:37.741
Mike, I know what
she wanted to do.

11:37.793 --> 11:39.459
What did she say?

11:41.797 --> 11:44.914
She said that she could
get you into Columbia,

11:44.916 --> 11:47.550
and that you could be a lawyer
after all this is over.

11:47.586 --> 11:48.718
Rachel, she's lying--

11:48.754 --> 11:49.886
You think I don't know that?

11:49.921 --> 11:51.338
Well, we've already
been over this.

11:51.390 --> 11:53.173
The only way she is gonna help
us is if we help her

11:53.225 --> 11:54.507
put Harvey and Jessica away.

11:54.559 --> 11:56.926
Yes, Mike, I know that,
but we didn't go over the part

11:56.928 --> 11:59.429
where I don't get into the Bar
because I took the Fifth.

11:59.431 --> 12:00.597
Oh, goddamn it!

12:00.649 --> 12:02.432
This is exactly why I wanted
Harvey to be there.

12:02.484 --> 12:04.017
She got into your head.
She didn't got into my head.

12:04.069 --> 12:05.735
She dangled our dream
in front of me,

12:05.771 --> 12:07.937
and I know
that we can't have that.

12:07.990 --> 12:09.739
It doesn't mean
I can't handle this.

12:13.111 --> 12:14.744
It doesn't seem
like you're handling it.

12:14.780 --> 12:16.112
- I am.
- You're crying.

12:16.164 --> 12:18.782
No. I'm releasing my emotions
so that I can persevere

12:18.834 --> 12:22.202
instead of denying them
and losing my mind.

12:22.254 --> 12:23.870
Which I can't do today,

12:23.922 --> 12:25.622
because I have a meeting
with the dean.

12:25.674 --> 12:27.540
Now, I came in here
to be alone

12:27.592 --> 12:28.792
so I can deal with my shit,

12:28.844 --> 12:31.344
so if you don't mind,
I would like to be alone

12:31.380 --> 12:32.679
so I can deal with my shit.

12:45.042 --> 12:46.882
Hey, did you find something
in the discovery?

12:46.911 --> 12:47.994
Yeah, sure as hell did.

12:48.046 --> 12:50.413
I just discovered that Gibbs
picked up Rachel.

12:50.415 --> 12:51.580
What?
She arrested her?

12:51.633 --> 12:53.553
No, she pulled up to the curb
with some document.

12:53.584 --> 12:55.251
I don't give a shit what she
pulled up with.

12:55.253 --> 12:56.502
Rachel should know
not to go with her.

12:56.554 --> 12:58.004
Yeah, and that would've been
an excellent thing

12:58.056 --> 13:00.306
for her lawyer to tell her,
except her lawyer wasn't there.

13:00.341 --> 13:01.590
- Excuse me?
- You promised me

13:01.592 --> 13:03.426
that you would be with her
every step of the way.

13:03.428 --> 13:05.428
I promised I'd represent her
at a deposition,

13:05.480 --> 13:07.146
not babysit her
24 hours a day.

13:07.181 --> 13:09.598
Maybe instead of getting mad
at Rachel, it is time for us

13:09.600 --> 13:11.350
to figure out
how to go after Gibbs.

13:11.402 --> 13:12.935
- This again.
- Yes, this again.

13:12.937 --> 13:15.271
I told you she was gonna go
after Rachel, and now she has.

13:15.273 --> 13:17.156
And I told you if you're
gonna go after someone,

13:17.191 --> 13:18.441
you better knock them out.

13:18.493 --> 13:20.660
Then you better figure out
a way to knock Gibbs out soon,

13:20.695 --> 13:23.079
because if you don't, I will.

13:32.123 --> 13:35.458
Louis.

13:35.460 --> 13:37.376
What are you doing here?
What?

13:37.428 --> 13:39.061
You thought you could lie to
my face and get away with it?

13:39.097 --> 13:40.379
- I never lied to you.
- Really?

13:40.431 --> 13:41.764
Because you swore
you wouldn't come forward

13:41.799 --> 13:43.215
about that e-mail,
but you did.

13:43.267 --> 13:45.101
And you you're pulling
this associate shit.

13:45.136 --> 13:46.802
I didn't come forward.
They found me.

13:46.804 --> 13:48.437
And I'm not pulling
any associate shit.

13:48.473 --> 13:49.889
Then what do you call
this pathetic excuse

13:49.941 --> 13:51.640
of a candidates list?
I call it inevitable.

13:51.693 --> 13:53.809
Because our students can read.

13:53.861 --> 13:55.144
- The editorial.
- Yes.

13:55.146 --> 13:57.146
The editorial.

13:58.399 --> 14:00.066
So you're not
sending us sludge.

14:00.118 --> 14:02.318
Louis, I'm not
doing anything.

14:02.370 --> 14:06.489
Your firm is being investigated
by the U.S. Attorney's office.

14:06.491 --> 14:09.241
And no one is going to risk
their career on a place

14:09.293 --> 14:11.210
that may not even exist
in a month.

14:11.245 --> 14:14.463
They might,
if you convince them to.

14:14.499 --> 14:17.083
- Louis, I can't do that.
- Sheila, please.

14:17.135 --> 14:19.135
I came here once before,
hoping for a second chance

14:19.170 --> 14:20.336
and you wouldn't
give it to me.

14:20.338 --> 14:21.670
What does that
have to do with this?

14:21.672 --> 14:23.055
Because if we'd gotten
back together then,

14:23.091 --> 14:24.473
I wouldn't even be
at the firm now,

14:24.509 --> 14:26.175
but I am.

14:26.227 --> 14:28.511
And it's all I have.

14:28.563 --> 14:32.098
I understand you not giving
me a second chance then.

14:33.601 --> 14:37.069
But I'm begging you...

14:37.105 --> 14:38.988
give my firm one now.

14:39.023 --> 14:43.609
Louis, even if I wanted to,
it won't work.

14:43.661 --> 14:45.694
- You don't know that.
- Yes, I do.

14:45.696 --> 14:48.030
Because they're going to ask me
if I think it's a good idea

14:48.082 --> 14:51.333
for them to work at Pearson
Specter Litt, and I don't.

14:51.369 --> 14:54.503
- Sheila--
- Louis.

14:54.539 --> 14:56.756
Please don't ask me
to lie to them.

15:03.765 --> 15:05.181
What are you doing?

15:05.216 --> 15:06.849
I'm just wondering
if you're gonna stay in here

15:06.884 --> 15:08.050
going over stuff all day.

15:08.102 --> 15:09.969
What else would I be doing?
Going to the ball game?

15:10.021 --> 15:11.554
I don't know, Harvey,

15:11.556 --> 15:13.189
I thought maybe you'd be doing
something to get Anita Gibbs

15:13.224 --> 15:14.273
to back off Rachel.

15:14.308 --> 15:16.058
Donna, she threatened
to go to the Bar.

15:16.060 --> 15:18.060
It's a bullshit hypothetical
that she couldn't do

15:18.062 --> 15:19.445
until after Rachel testified.

15:19.480 --> 15:21.063
Which is after
the trial starts,

15:21.115 --> 15:22.648
and that's what I'm
goddamn working on.

15:22.700 --> 15:24.533
Harvey, all I'm saying is

15:24.569 --> 15:26.902
that when Mike gets worked up
about something,

15:26.904 --> 15:28.584
he doesn't tend to make
the best decisions.

15:28.623 --> 15:30.039
Well, if he doesn't work
on the discovery,

15:30.074 --> 15:32.491
he's gonna go to jail, so...

15:32.543 --> 15:34.677
what do you want me to do?
I don't know, Harvey.

15:34.712 --> 15:36.629
But you better at least
go talk to Anita Gibbs,

15:36.664 --> 15:38.664
because Mike gave you
a warning loud and clear.

15:38.716 --> 15:41.250
If you don't do something,
he will.

15:51.179 --> 15:54.096
Jack, I don't often come
outside for my coffee,

15:54.098 --> 15:56.432
but when I do is because
I'm feeling the need

15:56.434 --> 15:57.817
for a little alone time.

15:57.852 --> 16:00.269
Well, I came out here because
I knew you wouldn't want

16:00.271 --> 16:03.405
anyone hearing
what I have to say.

16:03.441 --> 16:05.741
Are you here to tell me
you can get the job done?

16:05.776 --> 16:08.444
No, I'm here to tell you
if you want me to get it done,

16:08.446 --> 16:10.830
you're going to have
to open your wallet.

16:10.865 --> 16:12.615
I'm not paying you
more money,

16:12.667 --> 16:14.200
just to get you to
poach a department.

16:14.252 --> 16:15.701
I'm not talking about me.

16:15.753 --> 16:18.871
I'm talking the real estate
division of Baker Hostetler.

16:18.923 --> 16:21.173
- How much do they want?
- Double what they're making.

16:21.209 --> 16:24.793
Are you insane? That's what
broke Dewey Ballantine.

16:24.846 --> 16:26.679
You can't have two classes
of partners.

16:26.714 --> 16:28.264
Then we can't poach
a department,

16:28.299 --> 16:30.466
because they're the only ones
even willing to come here,

16:30.468 --> 16:32.434
considering what's going on.

16:35.473 --> 16:37.640
Then make the offer.

16:37.642 --> 16:40.976
And let me have
my goddamn coffee in peace.

16:48.402 --> 16:49.485
Ms. Scott,

16:49.537 --> 16:51.120
there's a Harvey Specter
here to see you.

16:51.155 --> 16:53.239
He says it's urgent.

to be Harvey to get in here.

17:00.464 --> 17:02.198

"Baby Harvey" once.

17:02.233 --> 17:03.732
I don't give a shit
what I called you.

17:03.768 --> 17:05.384
Get out! Now!
Scottie, Scottie, please.

17:05.419 --> 17:07.336
Listen, I knew you would
never agree to see me,

17:07.387 --> 17:08.387
and I need to talk to you.

17:08.422 --> 17:10.556
About what?

17:10.590 --> 17:12.007
I need someone
to bring an action

17:12.009 --> 17:14.093
against Anita Gibbs' sister.
Are you insane?

17:14.145 --> 17:16.011
Listen to me.
She's not just coming after me.

17:16.012 --> 17:18.814
She's coming after my fiancée.
I don't care.

17:18.848 --> 17:20.733
If I do that, I might as well
call the woman up,

17:20.768 --> 17:22.734
and tell her that I'm in
on your whole bullshit too.

17:22.770 --> 17:24.019
We get someone
from your firm--

17:24.070 --> 17:25.654
Not to mention I told Harvey
that I never

17:25.690 --> 17:28.190
even wanted to hear
your name again.

17:28.192 --> 17:29.358

about that, did he?

17:31.245 --> 17:32.494
[scoffs]

17:32.530 --> 17:33.946
Well, I guess
he hasn't changed,

17:33.998 --> 17:35.364
because he didn't
tell me about you

17:35.366 --> 17:37.032
until it was too late either.

17:37.084 --> 17:39.785
So I am sorry
about your fiancée,

17:39.837 --> 17:41.370
but I need you to go now.

17:41.422 --> 17:42.955
Scottie, this woman
is not gonna stop

17:43.007 --> 17:44.540
until she gets
what she wants.

17:44.542 --> 17:46.675
And what she wants
is Harvey.

17:46.711 --> 17:49.378
So I'm not asking you to do
this for me and Rachel.

17:49.380 --> 17:51.013
I'm asking you
to do it for him.

18:03.527 --> 18:05.227
Is that an invitation
to your <i>bar mitzvah?</i>

18:05.229 --> 18:06.528
because I'm busy that day.

18:06.564 --> 18:08.030
It's a motion
to have you sanctioned

18:08.065 --> 18:09.698
for improperly
contacting a witness.

18:09.734 --> 18:11.400
I didn't improperly
contact anyone.

18:11.402 --> 18:12.735
Oh, bullshit.

18:12.737 --> 18:14.203
You got Rachel Zane alone
so you could offer her

18:14.238 --> 18:15.404
a deal to turn on me.

18:15.456 --> 18:16.956
And there's nothing wrong
with that.

18:16.991 --> 18:17.991
You listen to me.

18:18.042 --> 18:19.408
You've been pulling shit
like this

18:19.410 --> 18:21.160
from the second
this thing started.

18:21.212 --> 18:23.212
You denied my client access
to his attorney,

18:23.247 --> 18:25.047
you fabricated charges
against Donna,

18:25.082 --> 18:26.642
and now you're tampering
with a witness.

18:26.667 --> 18:29.084
And all witness tampering
would do is hurt my own case,

18:29.086 --> 18:30.970
and why on God's green Earth
would I do that?

18:32.006 --> 18:33.472

18:33.507 --> 18:35.424
I said you're insane
if you think that--

18:35.476 --> 18:36.976
No, you said,
"on God's green Earth,"

18:37.011 --> 18:39.261
which is exactly
what that editorial said.

18:39.263 --> 18:40.562
I remember because I thought,

18:40.598 --> 18:42.982
"What person under 80
uses that phrase?"

18:43.017 --> 18:44.984
Well, looks like I found her.

18:45.019 --> 18:46.602
I don't know
what you're talking about.

18:46.604 --> 18:49.154
You sure as hell do, because
you planted that goddamn thing.

18:49.190 --> 18:52.324
You have any proof?
No, you don't.

18:52.360 --> 18:55.277
But even if I did plant that,
it would only have been

18:55.279 --> 18:56.945
because there's no way
that one of you

18:56.947 --> 18:58.280
did not know
what was going on.

18:58.282 --> 18:59.782
And until one of you
admits that,

18:59.834 --> 19:01.700

You go ahead.

19:14.877 --> 19:16.343

19:16.379 --> 19:19.797
Have a seat.
Thank you, Dean.

19:19.849 --> 19:22.933
I have to say I've
so been looking forward

19:22.969 --> 19:25.219
to my first student review.

19:25.221 --> 19:26.887
And ever since
your first interview here,

19:26.939 --> 19:28.856
you've done nothing
but impress me.

19:28.891 --> 19:31.525
Which is why I'm sorry
to have to bring this up now.

19:31.560 --> 19:33.060
Bring what up?

19:33.062 --> 19:35.729
The fact that your last LSAT
score was significantly higher

19:35.731 --> 19:37.197
than your previous ones.

19:37.233 --> 19:41.568
That is because I studied
incredibly hard the last time.

19:41.620 --> 19:46.407
Did you study hard? Or did
your fiancée study hard for you?

19:46.459 --> 19:48.959
You think Mike took
the LSAT for me?

19:48.995 --> 19:50.127
I think he's been indicted

19:50.162 --> 19:51.628
for more serious crimes
than that.

19:51.664 --> 19:52.796
And now there are allegations

19:52.832 --> 19:54.272
that he's taken the LSATs
for people.

19:54.300 --> 19:57.751
I can't believe this.
I took that test myself.

19:57.753 --> 20:00.671
And I have a responsibility
to protect the reputation

20:00.723 --> 20:01.889
of this university.

20:01.924 --> 20:03.474
And how exactly
are you proposing

20:03.509 --> 20:05.092
to protect that reputation?

20:05.144 --> 20:07.094
By expelling
any dangers to it.

20:09.015 --> 20:10.597
Unless, of course,
for some reason

20:10.649 --> 20:13.233
these allegations against him
are dropped.

20:14.603 --> 20:16.770
Anita Gibbs called you,
didn't she?

20:16.772 --> 20:18.439
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

20:18.441 --> 20:19.823
I'm simply giving you
the courtesy

20:19.859 --> 20:21.579
of letting you know
that if I have to choose

20:21.610 --> 20:25.612
between your future
and this university's,

20:25.614 --> 20:27.364
I'm not choosing you.

20:27.416 --> 20:29.833
Well, then, please,
tell Ms. Gibbs

20:29.869 --> 20:32.703
thank you for the courtesy.

20:40.963 --> 20:42.429
Scottie, what are you
doing here?

20:42.465 --> 20:44.214
I can't believe
you sent him to me.

20:44.266 --> 20:45.766
- Sent who?
- Oh, don't give me that.

20:45.801 --> 20:46.850
The last time
you came to me,

20:46.886 --> 20:48.435
you said it was
because Mike made you.

20:48.471 --> 20:50.137
Well, this time,
you made him.

20:50.189 --> 20:51.522
-I didn't made him do anything.

20:51.557 --> 20:52.856
Well, then, you taught him
well, because he came to me

20:52.892 --> 20:54.024
and pulled on my heart strings

20:54.060 --> 20:55.309
to get me to do
something for you,

20:55.361 --> 20:56.944
but this time
the answer is no.

20:56.979 --> 20:59.063
I am not going after
Anita Gibbs.

20:59.115 --> 21:01.315
Scottie, I would never ask you
to do something like that.

21:01.367 --> 21:03.534
That's funny, because you
asked me to throw a case

21:03.569 --> 21:04.868
to keep Mike
from getting caught.

21:04.904 --> 21:07.071
Throwing a case doesn't put
a target on your back.

21:07.123 --> 21:09.289
If you really wanted to keep
a target off my back,

21:09.325 --> 21:11.492
you never would've told me
about Mike in the first place.

21:11.494 --> 21:13.660
Scottie, I didn't tell him
to do that.

21:13.662 --> 21:15.829
Well, then, I guess you two
are having the same problem

21:15.831 --> 21:19.133
we did: You don't talk
to each other.

21:19.168 --> 21:22.052
Since you chose him over me
it's not my problem anymore.

21:22.088 --> 21:23.637
I didn't chose him over you.

21:23.672 --> 21:25.172
Yes, you did.

21:25.174 --> 21:26.390
And whether you choose
to admit it or not,

21:26.425 --> 21:27.391
it was Mike's secret

21:27.426 --> 21:29.093
that broke us up
in the first place.

21:41.907 --> 21:43.440
You let her in here
without telling me?

21:43.492 --> 21:44.942
I was in the conference room,
going over discovery.

21:44.994 --> 21:46.610
What are you going to do?

21:46.662 --> 21:47.995
I don't know what I'm gonna
do, but whatever it is,

21:48.030 --> 21:49.663
I'm gonna do it right now.
Harvey, calm down.

21:49.698 --> 21:51.865
I'm not gonna calm down,
you told me to go after Gibbs

21:51.917 --> 21:53.667
to stop Mike from doing
something stupid,

21:53.702 --> 21:55.836
and I did, and all that did
was waste our time

21:55.871 --> 21:57.204
like I said it would.
Harvey.

21:57.256 --> 22:00.090
Gibbs is attacking Rachel,
the woman he loves.

22:00.126 --> 22:02.126
You of all people should be
able to understand that.

22:02.178 --> 22:03.343
I don't give a shit.

22:03.379 --> 22:05.629
He had no right to go after
someone I love.

22:06.715 --> 22:08.215
Okay, you know what, Harvey?

22:08.267 --> 22:10.717
Mike is the one on trial here,
not Scottie.

22:10.719 --> 22:12.386
And all he did was ask her
to do something.

22:12.388 --> 22:14.438
So maybe the thing that you're
really upset about

22:14.473 --> 22:15.722
is that she was right.

22:22.448 --> 22:24.314
Well, how did it go?

22:24.366 --> 22:27.234
[sighs] We've known
each other a long time, Jack,

22:27.236 --> 22:30.737

but it's not gonna happen.

22:30.739 --> 22:32.739
You said if I could
get them double--

22:32.741 --> 22:35.659
I said it would take at least
double just to get me to ask.

22:35.711 --> 22:37.377
I did, and they laughed me
out of the room.

22:37.413 --> 22:38.912
What if I could
get you more?

22:38.914 --> 22:40.464
There's no number that's
going to get them to come

22:40.499 --> 22:42.466
to Pearson Specter because they
don't believe there's gonna be

22:42.501 --> 22:43.501
a firm to come to.

22:43.552 --> 22:46.086
Then why did you ask
to meet me here?

22:46.088 --> 22:48.505
Because after I asked them
about your offer,

22:48.557 --> 22:50.174
I asked them about mine.

22:51.260 --> 22:52.426
What are you talking about?

22:52.428 --> 22:54.344
I told them a former
fraternity brother of mine,

22:54.396 --> 22:55.896
who happens to be
a kick-ass lawyer

22:55.931 --> 22:58.265
might be looking for a change.

26:30.072 --> 26:31.822
She was lying.

26:31.857 --> 26:34.991
That was before I knew she
was able to get to the dean.

26:35.027 --> 26:36.259
What are you talking about?

26:36.295 --> 26:37.861
I had my meeting
with him today,

26:37.896 --> 26:39.262
and I thought he was
going to tell me

26:39.298 --> 26:41.731
how well I've been doing,
and instead...

26:41.767 --> 26:43.950
he threatened to expel me.

26:44.953 --> 26:46.753
[sighs]

26:46.788 --> 26:48.588
Okay.

26:48.624 --> 26:51.007
Okay, that--that doesn't mean
that it was Gibbs.

26:51.043 --> 26:53.043
- You weren't there.
- No, I wasn't there, all right?

26:53.045 --> 26:56.213
But it's not crazy to assume
that they would question

26:56.215 --> 26:58.715
whether or not you knew about me
without talking to Gibbs.

26:58.767 --> 27:01.051
Is it crazy for them
to mention a crime

27:01.053 --> 27:04.137
you haven't even been accused of
without talking to Gibbs?

27:04.189 --> 27:05.555
- What?
- They said there are rumors

27:05.557 --> 27:06.940
of you taking the LSATs
for people

27:06.975 --> 27:10.310
and they're accusing you
of doing that for me.

27:13.398 --> 27:17.734
Well...at least now
I know what I need to do.

27:22.541 --> 27:23.740
Harvey.

27:23.742 --> 27:25.408
I know how we can stop Gibbs
from pressuring Rachel.

27:25.410 --> 27:28.745
Does it involve going
to Scottie without telling me?

27:28.747 --> 27:30.413
- Harvey.
- Goddamn it, you had no right.

27:30.465 --> 27:32.132
I had every right,
because I knew Gibson

27:32.167 --> 27:34.501
would keep crossing lines,
and that's exactly what she did.

27:34.553 --> 27:35.585
What are you talking about?

27:35.637 --> 27:36.753
She manipulated
the Dean of Columbia

27:36.805 --> 27:38.004
into threatening
to expel Rachel.

27:38.056 --> 27:39.256
Where's your proof?

27:39.308 --> 27:42.008
They accused her of having me
take the LSATs for her,

27:42.060 --> 27:43.843
and the only problem is,
there's no record of me

27:43.896 --> 27:45.262
ever having
being accused of that.

27:45.264 --> 27:47.898
- The guy you saw in court.
- Yes, his name is David Green.

27:47.933 --> 27:50.433
He must've told Gibbs about me,
and then she used that

27:50.435 --> 27:52.152
to get the dean
to strong-arm Rachel.

27:52.187 --> 27:53.520
That's abuse of power.

27:53.572 --> 27:55.438
I told you, the only problem
with that theory is,

27:55.490 --> 27:56.940
David Green tells Gibbs
about you,

27:56.942 --> 27:57.991
and his career is done.

27:58.026 --> 27:59.576
Then he must've told her
anonymously.

27:59.611 --> 28:00.994
Which doesn't help us,
'cause we still don't have

28:01.029 --> 28:02.662
any proof that she
contacted the dean.

28:02.698 --> 28:05.782
No, we don't, but it wouldn't
be that hard for me to get.

28:05.834 --> 28:07.951
No, it could be a setup.
It's too risky.

28:08.003 --> 28:09.869
This whole goddamn thing
is too risky,

28:09.922 --> 28:12.038
but right now Rachel's future
is in jeopardy,

28:12.090 --> 28:14.624
and if I have to risk tacking on
a few years to save her,

28:14.676 --> 28:16.710
is not even a close call.

28:18.931 --> 28:20.380
All right.
Do what you have to do.

28:20.432 --> 28:22.132
Just don't get caught.

28:26.605 --> 28:28.521
[knocking]

28:28.557 --> 28:29.973
You're knocking.

28:29.975 --> 28:32.809
That means it's either bad news
or you want something.

28:32.811 --> 28:35.312
- I couldn't get the department.
- Don't tell me.

28:35.364 --> 28:38.114
They said we're in no position
to poach anybody.

28:38.150 --> 28:39.482
That's exactly
what they said,

28:39.534 --> 28:41.484
right before they
offered me a job.

28:41.486 --> 28:44.487
So you're here to tell me
you took it.

28:44.539 --> 28:46.623
I'm here to ask you
if you want me to take it.

28:46.658 --> 28:49.326
What the hell difference
does it make what I want?

28:49.328 --> 28:52.495
Jessica, when I left Boston,
people said I was a traitor

28:52.547 --> 28:55.832
and that I thought I was
too good for my own hometown.

28:55.834 --> 28:57.500
Well, it wasn't true.

28:57.502 --> 28:59.169
But I knew
the real test for me

28:59.221 --> 29:00.804
wasn't making it
in my own hometown.

29:00.839 --> 29:02.339
It was making it
in the toughest city

29:02.391 --> 29:04.224
in the world, and as far
as I'm concerned,

29:04.259 --> 29:08.511
I haven't done that yet.

29:08.563 --> 29:10.847
You want to be made
name partner.

29:10.849 --> 29:13.683
I wanna know if it'll ever
even be on the table.

29:13.735 --> 29:17.103
I could say yes
to that right now,

29:17.155 --> 29:20.357
but how would you know
you could trust me?

29:20.409 --> 29:22.409
I have no other choice.

29:22.444 --> 29:24.077

You know what it is.

has on you.

29:55.227 --> 29:56.226

29:56.228 --> 29:57.360
So you do remember me.

29:57.396 --> 29:58.396
Of course I do.

29:58.447 --> 30:00.613
You're the guy
we're prosecuting.

You hired me

What you don't know is that
I have a photographic memory,

your drivers license number

30:11.710 --> 30:13.576

30:13.578 --> 30:16.246
Not that it matters, because
I also made a copy.

30:16.298 --> 30:18.915

my clients' licenses.

30:29.928 --> 30:31.728
to expel Rachel Zane.

- I can't do that.
- Yes, you can.

30:36.401 --> 30:37.934
Okay, they went
to law school together.

Circumstantial public record
not good enough.

30:43.575 --> 30:45.108

and get caught,

30:45.110 --> 30:47.110

Attorney's office is over.

30:47.162 --> 30:48.328

to the D.A.,

31:08.633 --> 31:12.802
You might not have been smart
enough to get 178 on the LSATs,

31:12.804 --> 31:15.305
but I'm pretty damn sure
you're smart enough to do that.

31:24.533 --> 31:25.648

31:25.650 --> 31:27.033
That's what
you're gonna sign.

31:30.372 --> 31:31.871
This says you're dropping
a charge

31:31.907 --> 31:34.290
of malicious prosecution
in exchange for me admitting

31:34.326 --> 31:35.575
a sanctionable offense.

31:35.627 --> 31:37.710

31:37.746 --> 31:39.078
- Is this a joke?
- No.

a shred of proof

that I had anyone do anything.

31:53.762 --> 31:55.762
I have a copy of an anonymous
tip sent to you,

31:55.814 --> 31:57.180
saying I took the LSATs
for people,

31:57.182 --> 31:59.182
and a record of a phone call
from your office

31:59.234 --> 32:01.734
to the Dean of Columbia
ten minutes later.

32:01.770 --> 32:02.986
That's no proof of anything.

32:03.021 --> 32:05.071
It's proof enough for us
to sue Dean Herrick

32:05.106 --> 32:06.322
for every penny
he's ever made.

32:06.358 --> 32:07.857
You think when we get him
in a deposition

32:07.909 --> 32:08.909
he isn't gonna crack?

32:16.751 --> 32:19.035
You think you're pretty smart,
don't you?

32:19.087 --> 32:20.453
Smart enough to outwit
a U .S. Attorney.

32:20.505 --> 32:22.005
And if we can do it here,
what makes you think

32:22.040 --> 32:23.206
we won't be able to do it
in court?

Because court is not about
bullshit like this.

about what you said

I wanted you to know
the truth.

36:25.747 --> 36:27.330
And what exactly
is the truth?

36:27.382 --> 36:29.048
Our relationship didn't
end because of Mike.

36:29.084 --> 36:31.334
It ended because I wasn't
ready to confront

36:31.336 --> 36:34.170
what was wrong with me,
and I don't know

36:34.222 --> 36:36.005
if I'll ever be ready,
but...

36:36.057 --> 36:38.475
I've been seeing someone, and
I wanted to tell you about it.

And why does it matter
that I know that?

Harvey, it's always okay
to call me.

I've actually been going

if he's anything like Harvey,

38:22.747 --> 38:24.627
he probably thinks he can do it
better than you.
