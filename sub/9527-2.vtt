WEBVTT

00:01.043 --> 00:02.293
Okay, what?

00:02.378 --> 00:05.129
Have you seen these pieces?

00:05.214 --> 00:06.798
The breast pieces?

00:06.882 --> 00:08.591
-No.
-Let's finish the puzzle,

00:08.676 --> 00:10.885
-then you can keep the little booby pieces.
-Okay.

00:11.095 --> 00:12.261
Yeah, I do have 'em.

00:12.346 --> 00:15.056
Because I've really got into breasts lately.

00:15.182 --> 00:17.475
And also as of... The past, as well.

00:17.643 --> 00:18.976
Yo, guys.

00:19.061 --> 00:20.770
Just got a crazy harsh email

00:20.854 --> 00:22.397
from Del, the landlord, about rent being late.

00:22.940 --> 00:24.565
Okay, so what? Rent's always late.

00:24.650 --> 00:25.817
It's like our signature move.

00:25.901 --> 00:29.028
Yeah, man. It's like our Shakira
belly dance, basically, come on.

00:29.154 --> 00:30.446
It is like a Shakira belly...

00:32.116 --> 00:33.116
You still got it.

00:33.200 --> 00:35.451
And then the butt cheeks follow it with her...

00:35.828 --> 00:39.372
And secondly, Del freaking loves us.

00:39.456 --> 00:42.166
And I don't know about you guys,
but specifically, he loves my guts.

00:42.292 --> 00:45.128
Let's re-invite him over, crush a 30 rack,

00:45.379 --> 00:48.172
Blake will do some Family Guy
impressions. He loves those.

00:48.257 --> 00:51.175
Unfortunately, in the email
he specifically said,

00:51.593 --> 00:52.885
"Do not try inviting me over

00:52.970 --> 00:55.054
"to crush a 30 pack and do
Family Guy impressions."

00:55.139 --> 00:57.223
So we need the rent, like, nowzers.

00:57.683 --> 01:00.309
There's a bunch of stuff laying around
the house that we never use.

01:01.019 --> 01:04.731
-You thinking garage sale?
-No.

01:05.899 --> 01:07.734
- Oh!
- He wasn't looking!

01:07.818 --> 01:08.901
Whoo!

01:08.986 --> 01:11.237
-Brutus beefcake coming at you!
-Oh!

01:11.321 --> 01:13.531
Ahhh!

01:13.615 --> 01:15.199
-That was cool.
-That was cool, dude.

01:15.284 --> 01:16.701
Ow, that actually hurt.

01:16.785 --> 01:18.995
Oh, my goodness!

01:19.079 --> 01:20.079
We got a crowd.

01:20.164 --> 01:22.373
I told you people'd
show up. Get a donation.

01:22.458 --> 01:24.375
What, is that a hundo? Where'd you get that?

01:24.460 --> 01:26.169
We got to make 'em think
we're worth the big bucks, baby.

01:26.253 --> 01:27.420
My grandma gave it to me.

01:27.504 --> 01:28.713
Cool, safety first.

01:28.797 --> 01:30.089
-Hey, give me that!
-Did he take the 100?

01:30.174 --> 01:31.424
-Yep, they took it.
-That's 100 bucks.

01:31.508 --> 01:32.759
-Don't worry.
-Get 'em.

01:32.843 --> 01:35.094
-I got this.
-Hell yeah.

01:35.179 --> 01:36.429
- Oh!

01:36.513 --> 01:38.639
Everybody inside! Go inside.

01:39.475 --> 01:41.309
- Go. Go inside.
- I can't.

01:41.393 --> 01:43.269
-Go around. Go around the block.
-Get the keys, get the keys.

01:43.353 --> 01:44.353
Go around back!

01:48.525 --> 01:49.650
I'm fresh

01:51.361 --> 01:52.904
You gotta, you gotta
You gotta, gotta

01:52.988 --> 01:54.739
Gotta be fresh

01:56.867 --> 01:59.202
We really could've used that 100, Adam.

01:59.286 --> 02:01.454
-Yeah
-It's cool. We'll just ride it off.

02:01.705 --> 02:02.955
Did you say, "Ride it off"?

02:03.540 --> 02:05.291
Yeah, it's like a tax thing, you know?

02:05.375 --> 02:07.543
You just ride it off. Ride off the 100.

02:08.253 --> 02:11.589
Well, whatever. I know those little brats
definitely rode off with your 100.

02:11.673 --> 02:13.090
Yeah. We should kill 'em.

02:13.175 --> 02:14.217
Yo, yo, yo, dude.

02:14.301 --> 02:15.510
Dude, would you mind taking
a picture of us, yo?

02:16.929 --> 02:18.137
Okay.

02:18.222 --> 02:21.641
Dude, this is crazy, man.
I'm such a big fan of yours, man. Yeah!

02:21.725 --> 02:23.392
What are you a fan of?
How stinky his farts are?

02:23.519 --> 02:25.895
For real, the way
you poot, it ain't cute.

02:26.063 --> 02:27.980
You haven't seen this dude's show, yo?

02:28.148 --> 02:30.358
It is so dope, man.
This guy's an all-time legend.

02:30.442 --> 02:31.484
This dude is dope?

02:31.568 --> 02:32.693
Aw, man.

02:33.904 --> 02:34.987
Yeah, boy!

02:35.072 --> 02:36.656
What is he... You have a show?

02:36.740 --> 02:39.742
Only the most popular one
on Rancho Cable access.

02:40.619 --> 02:43.162
-Check it out, man.
-Welcome to Rancho.

02:45.332 --> 02:47.708
Today, we're at Hamilton Springs Park

02:47.793 --> 02:49.377
-in Southern Rancho...
-I've been there.

02:49.461 --> 02:52.213
...which is rumored to
have some nice benches.

02:52.297 --> 02:53.756
What a nice bench.

02:55.425 --> 02:57.885
If Bill has a show, we should
definitely have a show.

02:57.970 --> 02:59.554
But ours will be better 'cause we'll get, like,

02:59.638 --> 03:02.390
cool, famous people like
Jean-Claude Van Damme

03:02.474 --> 03:04.308
and film him doing, like, cool stuff.

03:04.601 --> 03:05.768
Oh, yeah, what if we, like,

03:05.853 --> 03:07.645
film him on a road trip across America?

03:07.729 --> 03:10.857
We could call it Jean-Claude's Damn Van.

03:10.941 --> 03:12.066
You guys, we can't...

03:12.192 --> 03:13.526
That's actually very cool.

03:13.610 --> 03:15.403
- That was a very good idea!
- Right?

03:15.487 --> 03:17.655
-Wow .
-Blake, that was very good!

03:17.739 --> 03:20.783
-Thanks, bro. I just kind of fell into that one.
-Jean-Claude's Damn Van, I love it.

03:20.868 --> 03:22.952
But here's something
that we can actually do, okay?

03:23.203 --> 03:25.496
Public access wrestling show.

03:25.581 --> 03:27.957
Okay, I'm actually very psyched for that,

03:28.041 --> 03:30.459
'cause I know we have casually
mentioned starting a federation,

03:30.544 --> 03:31.627
but it is a dream of mine,

03:31.712 --> 03:33.045
and if we could get it on TV,

03:33.130 --> 03:35.798
I think a lot of people
would pay to see us wrestle.

03:35.883 --> 03:39.719
Exactly, and everybody's seen
backyard wrestling, right?

03:39.803 --> 03:40.928
Done. It's played.

03:41.013 --> 03:42.597
But what haven't they seen?

03:42.973 --> 03:44.098
Front yard wrestling.

03:44.182 --> 03:47.059
Also, because you lost $100 last when we
were trying to do the wrestling thing,

03:47.144 --> 03:49.520
so I'm gonna take over as
commissioner of this federation.

03:49.605 --> 03:51.230
-Ugh.
-And you guys will be battling for

03:51.315 --> 03:53.900
inter-Rancho world championship belts.

03:53.984 --> 03:55.776
This is gonna be good.
I'm gonna go talk to Bill,

03:55.903 --> 03:58.070
find out how we get on public access and, uh,

03:58.822 --> 04:01.032
I might even scout the office for some talent.

04:01.283 --> 04:02.408
I don't know.

04:02.492 --> 04:03.910
It's all very exciting.

04:04.202 --> 04:10.249
Welcome to the Front Yard Wrestling
Inter-Rancho Wrestling Championship match.

04:10.334 --> 04:14.754
Let's get sweaty and wrestle!

04:14.838 --> 04:16.505
The event is ready to get started today...

04:16.590 --> 04:20.801
Coming to the ring now, you know him,
you love him, Eskimofo.

04:20.886 --> 04:22.303
Ricky, get out.

04:32.022 --> 04:34.273
I will tear into my opponent

04:34.566 --> 04:37.860
the way the mighty Kodiak
tears into a salmon!

04:39.863 --> 04:42.823
Okay, that's disgusting. This is... This is not...

04:43.241 --> 04:44.408
He's really doing this.

04:44.493 --> 04:46.285
He must be good at wrestling.

04:48.705 --> 04:51.499
I'll say that right there. Disgusting.
Waymond, what do you think?

04:51.708 --> 04:53.334
Oh, you probably like that. You are Asian.

04:53.418 --> 04:56.796
And now joining us in the east corner...

04:57.047 --> 04:59.215
A new kid on the scene battling for the belt.

04:59.675 --> 05:02.009
It's Adam.

05:02.177 --> 05:04.637
That's not very original at all, Waymond.

05:04.721 --> 05:08.140
Just with a simple name of "Adam."
Here we are. Here we are.

05:08.225 --> 05:09.558
Snap into wrestling!

05:10.143 --> 05:12.937
And snap into...

05:13.021 --> 05:14.438
Okay... Ow!

05:15.065 --> 05:18.192
Slim Jim!

05:18.568 --> 05:20.569
Dude, I don't know if we can say that on TV.
What are you doing?

05:23.323 --> 05:25.032
Oh, that was awesome.

05:25.117 --> 05:26.534
We are ringside. We're ready to get started.

05:26.618 --> 05:28.828
Oh, it's a furious start to the match.

05:31.873 --> 05:33.749
Eskimofo and Adam are dancing.

05:33.834 --> 05:35.668
-Yeah!
-Whoa!

05:35.752 --> 05:37.920
Ahhh!

05:38.171 --> 05:39.296
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

05:39.423 --> 05:41.090
-Was that cool?
-Yeah, yeah, man. You totally sold it.

05:41.174 --> 05:43.175
-Okay.
-You tricked me.

05:43.260 --> 05:44.885
Real quick, though, you're the jabroni.

05:44.970 --> 05:46.804
What? No.
We didn't plan it that way, all right?

05:46.888 --> 05:48.097
I win. I get the girl.

05:48.181 --> 05:50.141
-Okay, I'm gonna suplex you.
-I'm gonna suplex you.

05:50.225 --> 05:52.351
-One, two, suplex.
-Time out!

05:52.436 --> 05:53.978
Oh!

05:54.062 --> 05:58.107
Oh, well, if it isn't my beautiful daughter,
bratty Cathy, everyone.

05:58.191 --> 05:59.316
Whoo! Get him, baby.

06:01.611 --> 06:02.695
Excuse me.

06:02.779 --> 06:06.365
I see you've gotten the fur that daddy
bought you with all his money.

06:06.450 --> 06:08.659
Ooh, cha-ching, cha-ching.

06:08.869 --> 06:10.244
Oh!

06:10.620 --> 06:11.871
Love it! I love it!

06:11.955 --> 06:15.791
You ready to watch your boyfriend and my
favorite wrestler, Eskimofo, win the match?

06:16.084 --> 06:17.126
Is now the time?

06:17.919 --> 06:21.714
No, I actually want Adam to win! Whoo!

06:21.882 --> 06:23.632
-Ha!
-One, two...

06:24.760 --> 06:25.801
Ow! Ow!

06:25.886 --> 06:26.886
- Nice.
- Whoo!

06:26.970 --> 06:28.429
-I almost put it on.
-Two, three!

06:28.513 --> 06:29.805
Yeah!

06:29.973 --> 06:31.348
Child, what are you doing?

06:33.393 --> 06:34.977
-That hurt.
-Champion.

06:35.228 --> 06:36.228
-No!
-I'm the champion.

06:36.313 --> 06:39.607
My sweet daughter's rooting
for that guy now?

06:39.691 --> 06:40.775
No!

06:44.321 --> 06:45.446
-Ow!
-Champion!

06:45.530 --> 06:46.781
There's glass in my ass.

06:46.865 --> 06:48.032
I am the champion.

06:48.575 --> 06:49.575
Oh, wow.

06:49.659 --> 06:50.659
Hello out there.

06:50.744 --> 06:53.621
Hey, it's me, Commissioner Ders.
And if you liked tonight's action,

06:53.705 --> 06:56.082
then preorder your tickets
for next week's showdown.

06:56.166 --> 06:57.374
It's Rentlemania One!

06:57.709 --> 07:00.503
It's Eskimofo versus Adam.

07:02.589 --> 07:04.590
In a ladder match! Uh-oh!

07:04.674 --> 07:06.133
Bring the wife, bring the kids,

07:06.218 --> 07:08.803
because these maniacs are about
to bash each other's skulls

07:09.012 --> 07:10.096
into a soupy pulp.

07:10.180 --> 07:11.514
Two warriors, one ring.

07:11.723 --> 07:13.933
Rentlemania is coming-oming-oming-oming.

07:14.017 --> 07:15.601
-Dude, the commercial looks great.
-Thank you.

07:15.685 --> 07:17.436
-And we made 200 bucks, guys.
-That's awesome.

07:17.521 --> 07:19.146
Only 2,000 more, and we're good.

07:19.439 --> 07:20.981
Whoa, it's 5:00 in the morning.

07:21.066 --> 07:24.777
I guess we could either go
to bed, or... Oh, check it out.

07:24.861 --> 07:27.238
I got seven episodes of Doug.
You guys wanna watch that till work?

07:27.322 --> 07:28.322
Huh?

07:28.406 --> 07:30.449
I wouldn't mind Skeetering
on that Patti Mayonnaise.

07:31.827 --> 07:32.827
Up high.

07:32.911 --> 07:34.912
Like, nowadays, you might not
go for Patti Mayonnaise.

07:34.996 --> 07:36.205
Not with Roger Klotz in the building.

07:36.373 --> 07:38.082
I kept thinking you were saying,
"panty mayonnaise."

07:38.291 --> 07:40.751
Hey, I heard the show was on last night.

07:40.836 --> 07:42.795
Thank you for, um, for watching.

07:42.879 --> 07:44.213
I hope you did. I don't know if you did.

07:44.297 --> 07:47.133
I also heard they were gonna
give you my 4:00 a.m. time slot

07:47.217 --> 07:48.968
for something called Rentlemania?

07:49.052 --> 07:51.512
Shut up! We got the 4:00? They said that?

07:51.596 --> 07:53.848
- Is that... That's good?
- It's like, the primo time slot.

07:53.974 --> 07:54.974
Yes!

07:55.058 --> 07:56.934
I guess we're gonna be stacking paper.

07:57.060 --> 07:58.269
-Ooh.
-Which means cash.

07:58.353 --> 08:00.312
-But, that was my time...
-Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

08:00.605 --> 08:02.273
You're the front yard wrestler dude.

08:02.440 --> 08:03.607
Yeah.

08:03.692 --> 08:05.860
You're Eskimofo, right?

08:05.944 --> 08:07.153
-Yeah.
-And...

08:07.237 --> 08:08.988
Would you take... Oh, my God, it's Adam!

08:09.072 --> 08:10.698
-Yes it is! It is Adam!
-Whoo-hoo!

08:10.782 --> 08:12.408
Dude, would you take a picture of us?

08:12.701 --> 08:13.993
This guy's a tweaker, man.

08:14.077 --> 08:15.828
Let me just delete the photos of you.

08:15.912 --> 08:18.414
-Okay, I can get...
-No, no, I don't want... I don't want you, man.

08:18.498 --> 08:19.665
I want my heroes, man.

08:19.749 --> 08:21.417
-You guys are awesome!
-All right, get in here.

08:21.543 --> 08:23.002
Whoo!

08:23.086 --> 08:24.295
- Okay, that's good.

08:25.297 --> 08:26.338
Yes!

08:26.423 --> 08:28.507
-Dude, it's rad!
-Yes, it is rad!

08:28.592 --> 08:29.633
Front yard wrestling!

08:29.718 --> 08:31.343
-Front yard wrestling!
-God bless.

08:31.428 --> 08:32.678
That's why we do it, right there.

08:32.762 --> 08:34.180
Yeah, yeah. Well, no... Rent.

08:34.306 --> 08:36.098
-But yeah, I mean, people are watching.
-Yeah.

08:36.183 --> 08:38.434
Hey, would you guys want to be
interviewed on my show sometime?

08:38.560 --> 08:40.603
Could be good cross-promotion
for the station.

08:40.729 --> 08:42.021
Yeah, we should do it, I mean,

08:42.105 --> 08:44.773
'cause we did just jack your time slot.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.192
- Ooh.
- We did.

08:46.276 --> 08:48.485
I just realized that now.

08:48.570 --> 08:50.029
We just kind of bent you over the barrel, huh?

08:50.113 --> 08:51.155
-Yeah.
-So we'll do it.

08:51.239 --> 08:53.032
We'll give you a little bump
in the demo. How's that sound?

08:53.116 --> 08:55.868
We freaking bent you over the barrel,
and then butt-fucked you.

08:55.952 --> 08:59.914
Very cool. Well, I'll have my producer,
who's me, set it up.

09:00.123 --> 09:01.874
We didn't butt-fuck him.

09:01.958 --> 09:04.543
-Yeah, what was up with that? We didn't...
-We bent him over...

09:04.628 --> 09:06.420
I do not want to butt-fuck Bill.

09:11.718 --> 09:13.469
Welcome to Rancho!

09:13.678 --> 09:17.306
And congratulations to Adam.
You were champion of last week's match.

09:17.390 --> 09:18.557
Thank you.

09:18.642 --> 09:21.518
That's like my wrestling... Ahem.

09:22.062 --> 09:23.103
Thank you.

09:23.188 --> 09:25.898
Don't you think it's weird that you won,
considering you seem like

09:25.982 --> 09:28.067
a total zero with no personality?

09:30.070 --> 09:32.655
Yeah. Do you... More like you don't...

09:33.406 --> 09:37.743
Great. Really, the only wrestler with
any personality was Eskimofo.

09:37.827 --> 09:40.871
-Thank you.
-The racist caricature of an Inuit.

09:41.539 --> 09:42.623
-Well... I don't...
-What?

09:42.791 --> 09:46.210
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Okay, no. No!

09:46.294 --> 09:49.004
Everything I do as Eskimofo is an homage to

09:49.339 --> 09:54.551
the strong and powerful
igloo-dwelling whale riders.

09:54.636 --> 09:56.720
Well, here's what a couple of
American Indians

09:56.805 --> 09:59.014
we interviewed had to say about Eskimofo.

10:01.017 --> 10:02.601
Oh, this guy's cool-looking.

10:02.727 --> 10:04.019
This is embarrassing.

10:04.437 --> 10:07.147
I find this highly offensive.

10:07.232 --> 10:09.233
This is the worst thing
I've ever seen.

10:09.693 --> 10:11.026
So offensive.

10:11.611 --> 10:12.611
Why?

10:12.779 --> 10:13.988
That could've been about anything.

10:14.072 --> 10:16.448
-She just said, "Why?"
-She's an actress. I've seen her in movies.

10:16.533 --> 10:17.574
That's Lou Diamond Phillips.

10:17.909 --> 10:19.785
So what do you have to say for yourself?

10:19.869 --> 10:21.120
You don't have to say anything.

10:21.204 --> 10:24.206
I... I mean, I never meant to,
like, hurt anybody's feelings.

10:24.332 --> 10:28.335
I love the Eskimos. I love... In-Inu-Inu?

10:28.420 --> 10:29.962
-Inuit.
-Inu...

10:30.046 --> 10:32.047
Okay, well, "Inu" can get
the fuck out of here.

10:32.132 --> 10:33.507
-Thank you.
-Okay, 'cause I'm more angry

10:33.591 --> 10:35.175
than any Eskimo ever could be,

10:35.260 --> 10:37.553
because I've got a freaking dope personality.

10:37.637 --> 10:40.723
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you were
just another guy named Adam

10:40.849 --> 10:43.309
fake wrestling in my old time slot.

10:43.393 --> 10:44.476
So that's what this is about.

10:44.561 --> 10:46.520
Okay, you know what?
We're done with your name-calling

10:46.604 --> 10:48.147
and your "gotcha" journalism. It's time to go.

10:48.231 --> 10:49.940
-Get out of here! All you guys.
-Get your crew.

10:50.066 --> 10:52.609
-Hit the bricks!
-Can't come in my house...

10:53.778 --> 10:54.903
-Hey, Del.
-Hey.

10:54.988 --> 10:56.488
What's up, you funky homo sapien?

10:56.614 --> 10:59.325
-Deli meat.
-Yeah, come on, man. Let's get you a beer.

10:59.409 --> 11:02.077
- Uh, Lois, get Del a brewski.

11:02.245 --> 11:03.620
- You're really good.
- Stop it.

11:03.705 --> 11:05.831
Stop it. I didn't come here to hang out.
What's going on?

11:05.915 --> 11:07.499
What... Are you Bill?
You the guy who called me?

11:07.584 --> 11:09.126
I've been hanging out there
for, like, 10 minutes.

11:09.210 --> 11:11.754
Del Jacobson, you're the
landlord of this home, correct?

11:12.005 --> 11:13.505
What do you think about your tenants

11:13.590 --> 11:16.133
running an illegal wrestling
business on your property?

11:16.259 --> 11:20.095
Wrestling? Is that what...
That's what all that is?

11:20.180 --> 11:21.305
You're doing a wrestling tournament?

11:21.389 --> 11:23.390
For money, illegally, on your property.

11:23.475 --> 11:24.850
All right, no, guys, you can't do this.

11:24.934 --> 11:27.603
I've put up with a lot over
the years 'cause I like you.

11:27.771 --> 11:29.063
- Thank you.
- Not you.

11:29.731 --> 11:31.523
Late rent. No rent.

11:31.608 --> 11:35.027
The property damage from the earthquake
that somehow only hit this house.

11:35.153 --> 11:37.696
Look, Del, the only reason we're having
the whole wrestle thing is

11:37.781 --> 11:39.239
so we can raise money to pay rent.

11:40.158 --> 11:42.076
Del-zone. Come on.

11:42.285 --> 11:44.119
You can't tell us you don't love wrestling.

11:44.412 --> 11:47.289
Yeah, I loved wrestling, Adam,
when I was 10, okay?

11:47.374 --> 11:49.875
But I'm a grown-up now,
with grown-up responsibilities.

11:49.959 --> 11:52.503
I've got an ex-wife who's
clamoring for alimony.

11:52.921 --> 11:55.714
I've got a Cold Stone Creamery
franchise that's tanking

11:55.799 --> 11:57.841
due to a goddamn Pinkberry.

11:58.218 --> 12:00.928
All right? It's taking all my business
because everybody wants the

12:01.096 --> 12:04.598
healthy, fresh-flavored, refreshing... Garbage.

12:04.724 --> 12:07.393
Del, anything goes wrong
in one of these matches, you're liable.

12:07.477 --> 12:08.811
What show is this?

12:08.978 --> 12:10.145
What is this?

12:11.314 --> 12:13.524
Oh, this is our public access show.

12:13.608 --> 12:15.442
Okay, all this has to stop.

12:15.568 --> 12:18.195
The wrestling's over, guys. All right?
I can't have anything else go wrong.

12:18.822 --> 12:19.905
It's over.

12:20.156 --> 12:22.157
Hey, Del-zone! Guess what?

12:22.659 --> 12:25.869
We can't give the money back for Rentlemania
or else we won't be able to afford...

12:25.954 --> 12:27.079
My name isn't Del-zone.

12:27.163 --> 12:28.247
My name is Del.

12:28.331 --> 12:29.415
Del Jacobson.

12:29.499 --> 12:32.501
-Not Del-hyphen-anything.
-Deli platter.

12:32.585 --> 12:35.295
No! No wrestling, or you're evicted,

12:35.588 --> 12:37.297
because I own this place, okay?

12:37.382 --> 12:38.924
You cannot own the land.

12:39.175 --> 12:41.051
-What are you... I don't...
-It's the wrestling thing.

12:42.804 --> 12:46.849
Wow, it looks like the Rancho Cucamonga
Front Yard Wrestling League

12:47.058 --> 12:50.352
is about to experience a sad, quiet death.

12:50.687 --> 12:53.397
I'm Bill Stephenson saying, if it's in Rancho,

12:53.481 --> 12:55.190
we'll come and see it and talk about it.

12:56.818 --> 12:58.152
He's insane

13:01.197 --> 13:02.781
Think of all we've been
through at this house, guys.

13:02.866 --> 13:04.032
Remember our first kegger?

13:05.034 --> 13:07.786
Not really.
I passed out on that rock. I know that.

13:07.871 --> 13:11.582
I remember the memories that you guys
told me about that were yours.

13:11.791 --> 13:12.833
This sucks.

13:13.209 --> 13:15.419
Man, I thought our kids
were gonna be born here.

13:15.503 --> 13:17.504
I thought we were gonna die here, dude.

13:17.839 --> 13:20.174
Wait, you thought we were,
like, gonna get married

13:20.258 --> 13:23.218
and then live here together
with our wives and kids?

13:23.428 --> 13:24.553
I thought that was the plan.

13:24.637 --> 13:25.888
Whatever, man. We're screwed.

13:25.972 --> 13:29.892
The WW and FY... Whatever...

13:30.059 --> 13:31.059
FYCR.

13:31.144 --> 13:32.978
Yeah. It's dead, man.

13:33.062 --> 13:34.229
It's just... It's dead.

13:35.273 --> 13:36.732
No, it's not.

13:37.901 --> 13:40.819
Rentlemania is about to pop off and be

13:40.904 --> 13:43.489
the nastiest wreffling match
these people have ever seen.

13:43.573 --> 13:44.656
You said, "Wreffling."

13:44.741 --> 13:45.866
- Well, I'm just excited!

13:47.952 --> 13:50.537
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for joining us today.

13:50.622 --> 13:53.582
Unfortunately, I have some tragic news.

13:54.083 --> 13:57.419
Adam DeMamp died this weekend.
There will be no ladder match.

13:57.504 --> 13:58.712
There will be no wrestling.

13:58.796 --> 13:59.838
- Aw!
- No!

13:59.923 --> 14:01.840
This is outrageous. The crowd is going crazy.

14:01.925 --> 14:04.092
- No wrestling today, Waymond.
- No!

14:07.096 --> 14:08.222
What is that?

14:08.973 --> 14:11.016
Adam DeMamp is gone!

14:11.100 --> 14:12.226
Who the hell are you?

14:12.310 --> 14:14.353
Oh, is he Catwoman? I'm not quite sure.

14:14.437 --> 14:15.938
What is happening? Who?

14:18.441 --> 14:19.525
That's right!

14:19.609 --> 14:22.528
Adam DeMamp was killed this weekend,

14:22.612 --> 14:26.573
saving hundreds of Maxim models
from burning in a hotel alive.

14:26.658 --> 14:29.785
He was also sleeping with a ton of them.

14:29.869 --> 14:34.540
And then, his burned ashes were eaten

14:34.624 --> 14:37.709
-by an insane little street kitten.
-What?

14:37.794 --> 14:42.089
But he then transformed!

14:42.173 --> 14:44.716
I am...

14:44.801 --> 14:48.887
Catam!

14:48.972 --> 14:52.057
Hiss, hiss. Meow!

14:52.225 --> 14:53.892
Holy smokes.

14:53.977 --> 14:56.270
- Ladies and gentlemen, Catam is here.

14:56.354 --> 14:58.522
And that's all well and good, but

14:59.107 --> 15:01.149
unfortunately, there's no one for you
to wrestle because

15:01.234 --> 15:03.652
in other and even more tragic news,

15:03.736 --> 15:06.738
Eskimofo also died this weekend.

15:09.200 --> 15:12.327
Okay, what is this? What's going on now?

15:14.205 --> 15:19.626
-Yeah! That's right! Eskimofo is also dead.
-Oh, my God.

15:19.711 --> 15:21.587
I am Eracist!

15:21.671 --> 15:23.714
What? Just enunciate.

15:24.132 --> 15:28.010
E-racist. I am the Eracist. Right?

15:28.344 --> 15:29.928
-Tell 'em.
-We're not friends.

15:30.346 --> 15:33.265
Okay, look, your boy stole 100 bucks
from me the other day.

15:33.349 --> 15:36.184
I'm gonna let that slide if
you just say you're my friend, all right?

15:36.269 --> 15:38.395
Just say it, do it. Do it.

15:38.521 --> 15:40.397
- We're friends.
- Ah-ha! Yep!

15:40.648 --> 15:42.107
You hear that? You heard it.

15:42.191 --> 15:46.153
-All right.
-And we are here together to destroy...

15:47.280 --> 15:50.574
Erase... Racism.

15:50.658 --> 15:54.036
Just like I'm about to erase you, Catam.

15:57.373 --> 15:58.832
Uh-oh! It's a swing-in wrestle.

16:07.467 --> 16:08.592
Kill him!

16:23.858 --> 16:24.900
Oh!

16:25.401 --> 16:26.860
Oh, boys?

16:27.528 --> 16:30.447
Whoever gets that belt first
will not only get the belt,

16:30.531 --> 16:33.450
but you'll get something much,
much more valuable.

16:33.576 --> 16:35.911
My beautiful daughter's hand in marriage!

16:36.037 --> 16:37.412
-No!
-Yes.

16:37.497 --> 16:39.247
No, you can't force me to marry anybody.

16:39.332 --> 16:40.999
My heart belongs to Adam.

16:41.084 --> 16:43.043
Adam is dead! You heard him.

16:43.127 --> 16:47.756
I am a rich businessperson, and I command
you to marry the winner of this match.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.257
-No!
-Yes.

16:49.801 --> 16:53.595
There's not gonna be a winner,
'cause this match is over.

16:54.263 --> 16:56.014
You three are evicted.

16:58.601 --> 16:59.643
Scratch

17:03.106 --> 17:05.857
Del, you can evict us all you want, but, um...

17:06.901 --> 17:08.652
I think we're gonna finish this match.

17:08.820 --> 17:10.529
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

17:10.613 --> 17:11.988
Not on my property, you're not.

17:12.281 --> 17:15.534
Oh, damn, Waymond,
it just got real out here.

17:15.618 --> 17:17.202
Have you ever seen anything like this?

17:17.286 --> 17:19.830
Anders, do you think
we should shut this down?

17:20.248 --> 17:21.540
No, I don't, Montez.

17:21.624 --> 17:24.459
In fact, I don't know why we should do
anything this guy tells us to do.

17:24.544 --> 17:27.796
Because I'm the lord of this land,
and what... Oh!

17:28.089 --> 17:29.881
Ooh, that... Ooh.

17:30.633 --> 17:32.175
Adam, what are you doing, man?

17:32.593 --> 17:34.219
He was gonna evict us anyway, right?

17:34.303 --> 17:35.721
That doesn't mean we should kick his ass.

17:35.972 --> 17:38.181
- Oh, no.
- No, stop.

17:38.266 --> 17:42.310
I'm the one who's gonna enjoy
ass-kicking your dumb ass asses.

17:42.395 --> 17:43.979
Huh? Oh!

17:47.150 --> 17:48.984
Del, no! Oh, no!

17:52.989 --> 17:54.406
Oh! A double clothesline!

17:54.490 --> 17:57.784
Ahhh! Ahhh!

17:58.161 --> 17:59.578
Yeah, boy!

18:06.878 --> 18:08.003
Ahhh!

18:11.215 --> 18:12.549
Ahhh!

18:14.886 --> 18:17.679
Oh, my God, he's going nuts.
Straight beast mode, yo.

18:18.473 --> 18:19.848
Break his hands, Blake!

18:20.349 --> 18:23.393
I can't, man! His forearms are too strong!

18:23.478 --> 18:25.145
He scoops so much ice cream.

18:27.857 --> 18:30.317
-No, no.
-What's up, you fat little turd?

18:30.401 --> 18:31.818
You want some more of this? Huh?

18:31.903 --> 18:34.321
You're a fat... You are!

18:34.405 --> 18:36.114
- Ow!
- Adam.

18:36.199 --> 18:38.867
PS, I'm taking your security deposit.

18:38.951 --> 18:41.870
- Ow!
- Boo!

18:41.954 --> 18:45.916
Oh, yeah, I'm the bad guy.
I'm the bad... All right, shut up.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.209
Just shut up. Come here.

18:47.293 --> 18:50.504
Tomorrow, 2:30 to 5:30, Cold Stone Creamery
across from the junior high,

18:50.588 --> 18:53.089
half off all Oreo Overloads and
birthday cake remixes.

18:53.216 --> 18:54.466
I'll be scooping it up personally.

18:54.592 --> 18:56.635
Oh, what? What? You guys want that?

18:56.761 --> 18:59.679
I'm gonna get your belt, and I'm
gonna throw it in the trash!

19:00.181 --> 19:02.182
Oh, my goodness.
Look what is happening now.

19:02.266 --> 19:03.892
-Come on, give it to me.
-Hey, give it to me.

19:04.852 --> 19:06.311
They're both reaching for the belt.

19:08.147 --> 19:11.441
They're trying to get the belt. It's a slap fight.
It looks like two bitches going at it.

19:12.235 --> 19:13.360
-Del...
-Come here!

19:14.278 --> 19:15.362
Whoa.

19:15.446 --> 19:19.658
Oh, my goodness! Adam and Ders
have slammed Del down on the table!

19:19.742 --> 19:20.784
Whoo!

19:20.868 --> 19:22.327
Who's the champ? Who--who?

19:22.411 --> 19:23.578
I can't even speak anymore,
Waymond.

19:23.663 --> 19:24.955
Do you have anything to say?

19:25.206 --> 19:26.998
I mean, Waymond, did you see
what just happened?

19:27.083 --> 19:28.792
You all just made a huge mistake.

19:29.210 --> 19:30.335
You'll be hearing from my lawyer.

19:30.419 --> 19:33.755
Hey man, I might be a cat,
but you're a pussy, dude!

19:33.840 --> 19:36.091
-Poonanny!
-Yeah!

19:36.425 --> 19:39.135
Here we go, guys! TV event of the season.

19:39.220 --> 19:41.513
I think we're gonna get, like,
500 viewers this time.

19:41.597 --> 19:43.056
It was... It's just awesome, man.

19:43.140 --> 19:44.391
We're really just going out on top.

19:44.475 --> 19:46.601
I mean, I want them
to play this one at my funeral.

19:46.894 --> 19:49.646
-Yeah, totally.
-I am the landlord!

19:49.897 --> 19:52.524
--Hey, what's up, Del?

19:52.608 --> 19:54.234
- Did it start yet?
- You haven't missed it.

19:54.318 --> 19:56.111
It's about to be the best part, your part.

19:56.362 --> 19:57.571
Oh, yeah. Dude, here you come.

19:57.655 --> 19:59.406
Yo, you were, like, terrifying.

19:59.490 --> 20:00.574
I was legit scared.

20:00.658 --> 20:02.117
Yeah, only 'cause you sold it so hard.

20:02.201 --> 20:03.994
I think the audience bought it, though, right?

20:04.120 --> 20:05.453
Yeah. I hope they bought it.

20:05.538 --> 20:07.664
Considering you punched me in my nose.

20:07.748 --> 20:09.791
I feel like it's broken. It hurts.

20:09.917 --> 20:11.293
Yeah, yeah. Sorry about that.

20:11.377 --> 20:13.003
It's just, I never really liked you,

20:13.087 --> 20:15.380
so I had a shot, and I took it, you know?

20:16.716 --> 20:20.218
Yeah! Yeah, right!

20:20.386 --> 20:21.761
No, that's totally for real.

20:21.846 --> 20:28.059
You guys don't think it's funny?

20:28.144 --> 20:30.562
Yeah, right, Deli meat here
doesn't freaking love me.

20:30.688 --> 20:32.105
Right. Sure.

20:32.189 --> 20:35.025
- Shut up, okay?
- Okay.

20:36.193 --> 20:37.402
Yeah, I get that.

20:37.486 --> 20:39.070
Hey, anyway, thanks for letting me in on it.

20:39.155 --> 20:42.073
I had so much fun.
And I think after my plug hits the air,

20:42.158 --> 20:43.533
my Cold Stone's gonna be blowing up.

20:43.618 --> 20:44.951
Hmm, you know what else
is about to blow up?

20:45.161 --> 20:47.370
Your brain, dude, 'cause we
got your rent right here.

20:47.496 --> 20:49.331
Oh, thanks, man.

20:50.333 --> 20:53.168
You know, the next month's
rent's due in two days, right?

20:54.921 --> 20:56.838
Yeah, yeah. Uh-huh.

21:03.095 --> 21:06.222
Oh! A different world!

21:06.849 --> 21:09.267
Shake your belly. Ooh.

21:12.730 --> 21:13.855
Karl and homeless Mike.

21:14.023 --> 21:15.440
We taking over this planet, baby.

21:15.524 --> 21:16.858
We taking over the planet.
