WEBVTT

00:09.876 --> 00:11.910
(exclaiming)

00:16.116 --> 00:18.283
(school bell ringing)

00:20.820 --> 00:21.887
(Barney belches)

00:21.889 --> 00:23.856
(whistle blows)

00:23.858 --> 00:26.091
(yells)

00:30.030 --> 00:31.530
(beeping)

00:38.738 --> 00:40.973
(playing the harp)

00:43.376 --> 00:44.877
(tires screeching)

00:46.212 --> 00:47.513
D'oh!

00:47.515 --> 00:48.647
(tires screeching)

00:48.649 --> 00:50.449
(grunts)

00:53.053 --> 00:56.055
(electric humming)

01:09.069 --> 01:11.837
(shouting)

01:16.843 --> 01:20.012
D'oh. D'oh. D'oh. D'oh. D'oh.

01:20.014 --> 01:21.580
Family.

01:21.582 --> 01:23.882
Meet me at...

01:23.884 --> 01:26.085
the kitchen cube.

01:26.087 --> 01:27.352
D'oh. D'oh.

01:27.354 --> 01:29.688
D'oh. D'oh. D'oh.
(electric crackling)

01:29.690 --> 01:31.523
(growling voice):
I am Simpson.

01:31.525 --> 01:34.393
I am Simpson.
I am Simpson.

01:34.395 --> 01:36.095
(gurgling)

01:36.097 --> 01:39.264
(distorted)
Don't... Don't
have cow, man.

01:39.266 --> 01:42.768
I am Simpson.
I am Simpson.
Don't... Don't have cow, man.

01:42.770 --> 01:47.372
Don't... Don't have cow, man.
I am Simpson.
I am Simpson.

01:47.374 --> 01:51.543
(distorted):
Hail the dark lord
of the twin moons.

01:51.545 --> 01:55.114
I am Simpson.
I am Simpson.
Don't have cow, man.

01:55.116 --> 01:56.615
(gurgling)
(growls) Simpson.

01:56.617 --> 01:59.785
Cow, man.
I am Simpson.
I am Simpson.

01:59.787 --> 02:01.320
(babbling)

02:01.322 --> 02:02.988
(squishing)

02:02.990 --> 02:05.991
(low voice):
Make purchase
of the merchandise.

02:05.993 --> 02:08.160
D'oh.
Don't have
cow, man.

02:08.162 --> 02:10.596
I have... memories.

02:10.598 --> 02:13.732
(high-pitched tone)
<i>I have.... memor... memor...</i>

02:13.734 --> 02:16.468
(grinding, beeping)

02:16.470 --> 02:18.570
(gentle piano playing)

02:18.572 --> 02:21.507
(high-pitched):
Still love you, Homar.

02:21.509 --> 02:25.544
(high-pitched, distorted):
We are happy family.

02:31.351 --> 02:33.819
All animals can scream.

02:33.821 --> 02:36.021
(low growling)
Make purchase of
the merchandise.

02:36.023 --> 02:39.491
I am Simpson. I am Simpson.
Don't have cow, man.

02:39.493 --> 02:41.727
D'oh.

02:50.436 --> 02:51.603
Three feet, nine inches.

02:51.605 --> 02:53.338
That should do it.
Don't you know

02:53.340 --> 02:55.574
what kind of animal
we're dealing with?

02:56.543 --> 02:57.809
Okay, enough theory.

02:57.811 --> 02:59.611
Hey, Dad.
We made popcorn.

02:59.613 --> 03:01.113
HOMER:
Woo-hoo!

03:01.881 --> 03:03.515
Huh? Out of my reach?

03:03.517 --> 03:07.452
(grunts)
Must... make... effort.

03:10.857 --> 03:12.257
(grunting)

03:14.227 --> 03:15.227
(bones crack)

03:15.229 --> 03:17.296
Yay.

03:17.298 --> 03:19.665
Mr. Simpson,
you earned this.

03:19.667 --> 03:22.467
(quiet grunts)

03:22.469 --> 03:23.969
What's on TV?

03:23.971 --> 03:26.104
Krusty's getting
roasted tonight.

03:35.982 --> 03:37.382
Hey.

03:37.384 --> 03:39.384
(grumbles)
Sometimes the language

03:39.386 --> 03:42.588
on these gets a
little B-L-U-E.

03:42.590 --> 03:43.755
What?

03:43.757 --> 03:45.424
Oh.

03:45.426 --> 03:47.526
If you don't let us watch,
we'll just go to a house

03:47.528 --> 03:49.394
where some more
permissive parents will.

03:49.396 --> 03:50.729
How permissive?

03:50.731 --> 03:53.198
Chief Wiggum shows us
crime photos at sleepovers.

03:53.200 --> 03:55.167
So this is what a body
looks like

03:55.169 --> 03:58.170
after it drops
60 stories.

03:58.172 --> 04:00.372
Uh, come on, Milhouse,
don't pretend you're asleep.

04:00.374 --> 04:01.940
This is the world we live in.

04:01.942 --> 04:03.175
Yeah.

04:03.177 --> 04:04.576
(crowd laughs over TV)

04:04.578 --> 04:07.546
Hey, Krusty, our local deli
just named a sandwich after you.

04:07.548 --> 04:10.115
It's called
"The Unfunny Comedian."

04:10.117 --> 04:11.083
(crowd laughs)

04:11.085 --> 04:12.084
You will always be
remembered for

04:12.086 --> 04:13.619
your countless
appearances on

04:13.621 --> 04:14.953
the <i>Krusty the Clown Show</i>

04:14.955 --> 04:17.356
and your one appearance
on <i>To Catch A Predator.</i>

04:17.358 --> 04:18.857
(crowd laughs)

04:18.859 --> 04:21.593
Hey, I spent a lifetime
making people happy.

04:21.595 --> 04:24.563
Yeah-- plastic surgeons
and divorce lawyers.

04:24.565 --> 04:26.365
I was just about to say that.

04:26.367 --> 04:28.800
Oh, he took my laugh.

04:28.802 --> 04:30.569
Screw it, I'm doing it anyway.

04:30.571 --> 04:34.406
Plastic surgeons
and divorce lawyers.

04:34.408 --> 04:36.141
(man coughs)

04:36.143 --> 04:38.310
What a legend. Krusty
the Clown is to comedy

04:38.312 --> 04:41.280
what Martin Luther King
is to comedy.

04:41.282 --> 04:42.614
(laughter)

04:44.651 --> 04:47.119
We've seen a lot
of top-flight comics tonight,

04:47.121 --> 04:49.154
but that's over,
because it's time

04:49.156 --> 04:51.290
to hear from Krusty the Clown.

04:51.292 --> 04:52.491
Welcome, Krusty.

04:52.493 --> 04:54.126
I grew up watching you.

04:54.128 --> 04:55.494
Oh, uh, sorry.

04:55.496 --> 04:57.462
I threw up watching you.

04:57.464 --> 04:58.797
(laughter, applause)

04:58.799 --> 05:00.132
(grumbles)

05:00.134 --> 05:01.500
Sarah Silverman.

05:01.502 --> 05:04.736
I say this with love,
you disrespectful skank.

05:04.738 --> 05:07.339
You've had more... Oh.

05:07.341 --> 05:09.641
Suddenly, I don't
feel like doing this.

05:09.643 --> 05:10.876
(gasps)

05:11.844 --> 05:14.479
Sorry, Mini-ha-ha.
Canceling the bit.

05:14.481 --> 05:16.915
Tell the others.

05:18.151 --> 05:21.320
I thought this night would be
fun for me and my friends.

05:21.322 --> 05:23.221
I don't even know these people.

05:24.290 --> 05:26.358
And I guess I don't
have any friends.

05:26.360 --> 05:28.527
My only comfort
is the roast is over

05:28.529 --> 05:30.462
and will only be shown
four times a day

05:30.464 --> 05:33.332
for the rest of all time.

05:34.434 --> 05:35.767
Krusty.

05:35.769 --> 05:37.369
Yeah?
Is your nose red

05:37.371 --> 05:39.504
because it's embarrassed
to be seen with you?

05:39.506 --> 05:40.939
(laughter)
Oh, nobody warned me

05:40.941 --> 05:43.008
this roast would treat me
the same way

05:43.010 --> 05:46.378
as every roast I've seen
and laughed at.

05:46.380 --> 05:49.114
...and the husband says,
"Who paid you a nickel?"

05:49.116 --> 05:50.882
And the wife says,
"Everybody."

05:50.884 --> 05:52.250
(laughs)

05:53.186 --> 05:55.120
Oh, sorry,
wrong for this audience.

05:55.122 --> 05:57.255
I thought Swapper Jack's
was something else.

05:58.491 --> 06:00.726
Krusty, sorry
about the roast.

06:00.728 --> 06:03.228
They had no right to say
those hilarious things.

06:03.230 --> 06:05.997
How could they say
I'm past my prime?

06:05.999 --> 06:08.300
Me-- the voice of Ovaltine.

06:08.302 --> 06:10.135
Krusty, why don't you
talk to your dad?

06:10.137 --> 06:11.970
He'll cheer you up.
He's a rabbi.

06:11.972 --> 06:13.905
He must've learned something
from that giant star scroll

06:13.907 --> 06:15.173
he's always reading.

06:15.175 --> 06:18.310
Kid, does talking to your dad
make you feel better?

06:18.312 --> 06:20.345
Well, no, but he's not a rabbi.

06:20.347 --> 06:22.647
More of a flabbi.
(snorts, laughs)

06:22.649 --> 06:25.550
Why, you little...
I'll show you who's a flabbi!

06:25.552 --> 06:27.018
(grunting)

06:27.020 --> 06:28.387
(muffled):
No, you're not a flabbi!

06:28.389 --> 06:29.721
Yeah, all muscle.

06:29.723 --> 06:32.591
In Minnesota,
I'd be a supermodel.
Okay, I got it.

06:34.660 --> 06:38.764
So, basically, I came here
so you could tell me the truth--

06:38.766 --> 06:40.165
that I'm great.

06:40.167 --> 06:43.502
As the Torah says:
Judgment belongs to God.

06:43.504 --> 06:45.337
The Torah also says
you can't eat ham,

06:45.339 --> 06:47.406
and I'm the spokesman
for HamCo Ham.

06:47.408 --> 06:50.342
This is why I only call you
on Christmas and Easter.

06:50.344 --> 06:52.277
Wait, wait, wait. Please, Dad.

06:52.279 --> 06:54.212
Do you even think I'm funny?

06:54.214 --> 06:55.580
I'm not gonna lie
to you, for funny,

06:55.582 --> 06:57.182
I prefer Rabbi Rudenstein.

06:57.184 --> 07:00.419
He puts the "ha" in Hanukah
and the "levity" in Leviticus.

07:00.421 --> 07:02.354
As for you, son,
if you want to know

07:02.356 --> 07:06.425
my honest opinion of you,
you've always been... eh.

07:06.427 --> 07:08.260
Go on.

07:08.262 --> 07:11.496
I've always been
"Eh... ntertaining"?

07:12.598 --> 07:14.032
Dad?

07:16.269 --> 07:17.869
Show me nose fog.

07:19.705 --> 07:21.573
Oh, God, he's dead.

07:21.575 --> 07:24.609
And he never lived
to see me be successful.

07:24.611 --> 07:26.545
(sobbing)

07:34.320 --> 07:36.388
<i>A pusten fas hilcht hecher.</i>

07:36.390 --> 07:39.090
"An empty barrel
reverberates loudly."

07:39.092 --> 07:41.726
And today, my heart
is that barrel.

07:41.728 --> 07:44.796
Even though my father and I
had our difficulties,

07:44.798 --> 07:46.965
(sobs) he was a great man.

07:46.967 --> 07:49.067
And, well, he always...

07:50.670 --> 07:52.337
Wha?
Eh.

07:52.339 --> 07:54.105
Eh.
Eh.
Eh.

07:54.107 --> 07:56.708
Eh.
Eh.
Eh.

08:00.680 --> 08:01.646
(sighs)

08:01.648 --> 08:03.148
Look, I'm an entertainer.

08:03.150 --> 08:06.318
So maybe the best way to say
how I feel about my dad

08:06.320 --> 08:08.153
is through a song

08:08.155 --> 08:10.989
that someone else wrote
that I hired people to sing.

08:10.991 --> 08:12.624
This is for you, Dad.

08:12.626 --> 08:14.960
(to the <i>Itchy & Scratchy</i> theme):
♪ He fought and fought

08:14.962 --> 08:17.295
♪ And fought for Jewish rights

08:17.297 --> 08:18.697
♪ Wisdom sought

08:18.699 --> 08:20.465
♪ Students taught

08:20.467 --> 08:24.402
♪ Rabbi Krustofsky's gone.

08:25.972 --> 08:27.973
Yeah, well, it's just...
well, I thought...

08:27.975 --> 08:30.876
Seriously, it can be really
tough to lose your father.

08:30.878 --> 08:32.277
(crying)

08:35.214 --> 08:36.781
RUDENSTEIN:
<i>Yasher Co-ack.</i>

08:36.783 --> 08:38.917
Let us all please rise.

08:40.152 --> 08:41.753
(snoring)
Homer, get up.

08:42.655 --> 08:44.022
Huh? Oh, uh...

08:44.024 --> 08:46.525
(grunting)

08:46.527 --> 08:47.859
Oh! Oh!

08:47.861 --> 08:50.061
Ooh!
(panting)

08:50.063 --> 08:51.897
Dad, are you okay?

08:51.899 --> 08:54.132
Yeah, yeah, great. (sighs)

08:54.134 --> 08:57.369
I guess my getting-up
days are over.

08:57.371 --> 08:58.703
(gasps)

09:01.207 --> 09:02.541
(humming a tune)

09:02.543 --> 09:04.676
Dad, you're eating
too much.

09:04.678 --> 09:06.478
I'm worried about
your health.

09:06.480 --> 09:08.547
I don't want
to lose you.

09:10.249 --> 09:12.217
(softly):
Oh, no.

09:12.219 --> 09:14.986
Krusty, I brought some
homemade chicken soup.

09:14.988 --> 09:17.923
We used the Play-Doh maker
for the matzo.

09:17.925 --> 09:21.026
Uh, thanks, but I don't
really like soup.

09:21.028 --> 09:23.562
But you wear that little spoon
around your neck.

09:23.564 --> 09:24.663
(chuckles)

09:24.665 --> 09:26.331
You really notice
stuff, don't you?

09:26.333 --> 09:29.034
Yes. And I can tell
how hard it was

09:29.036 --> 09:30.502
to lose your father.

09:30.504 --> 09:33.104
But at least you were there
to share his final thoughts.

09:33.106 --> 09:34.272
Eh.

09:34.274 --> 09:36.241
No, no, it's a big thing.

09:36.243 --> 09:37.576
No, that's what he called me.

09:37.578 --> 09:38.843
"Eh."

09:38.845 --> 09:40.745
Mm. It could be worse.

09:40.747 --> 09:42.047
Oh, yeah? How?

09:42.049 --> 09:43.081
I don't know, uh...

09:43.083 --> 09:44.849
how about...
(blows raspberry)

09:44.851 --> 09:46.418
That's a lot worse.

09:46.420 --> 09:48.553
Can you stop
comforting me now?

09:48.555 --> 09:52.023
Krusty, condolences
on your loss.

09:52.025 --> 09:54.960
So this is the Bob

09:54.962 --> 10:00.198
whose comedic genius
I can never live up to.

10:00.200 --> 10:03.935
Believe me, all of us
have thought about killing him.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.670
(sighs)

10:09.809 --> 10:11.276
Clowns have it tough,
Krusty.

10:11.278 --> 10:13.411
I understand.
I was Professor Pickles

10:13.413 --> 10:15.947
with Ringling Brothers
for several years.

10:15.949 --> 10:17.649
The elephant and I
had our differences.

10:17.651 --> 10:18.917
So,

10:18.919 --> 10:21.119
what brings you here?
And don't say clown car.

10:21.121 --> 10:24.055
I'm a sad, tragic clown.

10:24.057 --> 10:26.291
Like what's his
name-- Liberace.

10:26.293 --> 10:28.526
Tell me about
your father, huh?

10:30.496 --> 10:32.297
Ah!

10:32.299 --> 10:34.766
Herschel, did you
read your Exodus?

10:34.768 --> 10:36.601
Oh, uh, oh, sure.

10:36.603 --> 10:39.671
Really? Then tell me,
what did the burning bush say?

10:39.673 --> 10:41.272
It said "Ow! Put me out!

10:41.274 --> 10:43.808
How many talking bushes
do you think there are?!"

10:43.810 --> 10:44.776
(laughs)

10:44.778 --> 10:47.445
My son, you are a
big needy nothing

10:47.447 --> 10:48.947
that only
laughs can fill.

10:48.949 --> 10:51.149
(scoffs)
I don't need laughs.

10:51.151 --> 10:52.183
Ha.

10:52.185 --> 10:54.419
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

10:54.421 --> 10:57.155
A big needy nothing.
(sniffles)

10:57.157 --> 10:58.790
Wow. Wow.

10:58.792 --> 11:01.092
Krusty, would you like
a therapy dog?

11:01.094 --> 11:02.927
Yeah. With extra relish!

11:02.929 --> 11:05.330
Hey-hey! I still
got it, huh?

11:05.332 --> 11:07.866
Yes, if by "it"
you mean reflexive denial

11:07.868 --> 11:09.167
of your inner sadness.

11:09.169 --> 11:10.468
(sadly):
Hey-hey.

11:10.470 --> 11:11.903
SIDESHOW MEL:
<i>Shut up, children.</i>

11:12.938 --> 11:14.639
Boys and girls, you know

11:14.641 --> 11:17.876
that we've been dark
for a couple of days because

11:17.878 --> 11:21.179
of a tragic loss
in the Krustylu family.

11:21.181 --> 11:23.148
Now put your hands together

11:23.150 --> 11:26.051
for the man who's falling apart
before our eyes,

11:26.053 --> 11:29.054
Krusty the Clown!

11:29.056 --> 11:30.555
(kids cheering)

11:30.557 --> 11:32.791
(jaunty theme music plays)

11:34.160 --> 11:37.095
No monologue. Roll the cartoon.

11:38.130 --> 11:40.265
(swing creaking)

11:43.135 --> 11:45.036
Oh, my God!

11:45.038 --> 11:48.373
Who made
this monstrosity?

11:48.375 --> 11:49.908
I did everything!

11:49.910 --> 11:53.812
Kids, I'm experiencing
a crisis of conscience.

11:53.814 --> 11:55.413
(canned applause)

11:55.415 --> 11:56.881
No, no, no, no!

11:56.883 --> 12:00.218
I don't deserve the prerecorded
applause of children long gone.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.854
(canned applause)
KID: I like Ike!

12:02.856 --> 12:05.190
Therefore,
I'm quitting the show.

12:05.192 --> 12:07.525
And I know Mel
will be quitting it with me.

12:07.527 --> 12:09.894
Yes, yes, buy the house.
It'll be...

12:09.896 --> 12:11.563
Uh, what?!

12:11.565 --> 12:13.998
Today is the day
the pity laughter died.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.101
Krusty the Clown has retired.

12:16.103 --> 12:18.670
For a brief overview
of a half-century of ha-has,

12:18.672 --> 12:21.506
here is Channel Six
TV critic Clive Meriwether.

12:21.508 --> 12:24.175
Krusty the Clown
will perhaps best be remembered

12:24.177 --> 12:27.545
for taking up two spots
in the Channel Six parking lot.

12:27.547 --> 12:31.516
On a personal level, he used to
call me Little Lord Tingaling.

12:31.518 --> 12:33.017
I shan't miss that.

12:33.019 --> 12:36.221
This man's only lasting legacies
are a law in his name

12:36.223 --> 12:40.024
limiting the working hours
of chimpanzees to 14 hours a day

12:40.026 --> 12:42.260
and the invention
of the payment of alimony

12:42.262 --> 12:44.629
by dropping hot pennies
from a helicopter.

12:44.631 --> 12:46.698
I give his life a D-plus.

12:46.700 --> 12:48.566
Good day to you.

12:48.568 --> 12:49.868
What will Krusty do now?

12:49.870 --> 12:51.903
I suppose only time will tell.

12:51.905 --> 12:54.272
Which is true
for all news stories, I guess.

12:54.274 --> 12:55.540
Until anyone realizes,

12:55.542 --> 12:57.942
I'm Kent Brockman
adding no useful information.

12:57.944 --> 12:59.878
And here's another sentence.

12:59.880 --> 13:02.947
You can tell I'm winding it up
because my voice is going <i>up</i>

13:02.949 --> 13:05.383
and <i>down</i> like this.

13:06.218 --> 13:09.154
Well, at least now
I have plenty of time

13:09.156 --> 13:11.489
to solve this Rubik's Cube.

13:11.491 --> 13:13.391
All right, what if I did...

13:13.393 --> 13:15.360
Oh!

13:19.598 --> 13:21.766
(Homer snoring unevenly)

13:21.768 --> 13:24.435
(snoring, gasping)

13:24.437 --> 13:25.837
(quietly):
Mom, Dad.

13:25.839 --> 13:27.105
Yes, Lisa?

13:27.107 --> 13:28.573
(snores)
What?

13:28.575 --> 13:30.675
I've been listening,
and Dad stops breathing

13:30.677 --> 13:33.244
for as long as
five minutes.

13:33.246 --> 13:36.080
Mind if I sleep with you guys
and keep an eye on him?

13:36.082 --> 13:39.150
Sweetie, you shouldn't have
to worry about such things.

13:39.152 --> 13:41.953
(gasps, snores,
wheezing)

13:41.955 --> 13:44.455
The doctor gave us this machine
to help him breathe

13:44.457 --> 13:45.757
in his sleep. Go to bed.

13:45.759 --> 13:47.492
I'll take care of him.

13:48.427 --> 13:49.761
No good. No good.

13:49.763 --> 13:51.296
(grunting)
Oh! Ooh! Ah!

13:51.298 --> 13:53.431
(gasping)
What do I do?
What do I do?

13:53.433 --> 13:56.534
Oh. Breathe,
Homie, breathe.

13:56.536 --> 13:58.736
(grunting)

14:11.116 --> 14:13.785
Well, at least
Teeny's doing okay.

14:13.787 --> 14:16.621
He's in <i>The Odd Couple</i>
<i>with David Hyde Pierce.</i>

14:16.623 --> 14:19.290
Now, really, Oscar, would it
kill you to use a coaster?

14:19.292 --> 14:22.160
(screeching)

14:22.162 --> 14:25.763
If you're going to go up there,
at least dust!

14:26.866 --> 14:30.235
Finally, done the way
I first imagined it.

14:30.237 --> 14:32.537
I'm gonna prove
you did groundbreaking work.

14:32.539 --> 14:34.205
Krusty, I want you
to binge-watch

14:34.207 --> 14:36.207
all the shows you've ever done.

14:36.209 --> 14:39.711
Well, I've never
said no to a binge.

14:39.713 --> 14:40.578
(static crackles)

14:40.580 --> 14:42.313
Deuteronomy?

14:42.315 --> 14:44.249
Isn't that the study of deuters?

14:44.251 --> 14:45.683
Hippocampus?

14:45.685 --> 14:48.920
Isn't that another name for
the University of Mississippi?

14:48.922 --> 14:50.388
Okay. I've been
on 50 years.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.523
You're bound
to repeat yourself a little.

14:52.525 --> 14:55.526
Unless I wanted to be sat on
by Mama Cass.

14:55.528 --> 14:58.696
Unless I wanted to be sat on
by Dom DeLuise.

14:58.698 --> 15:01.032
...by the cast of
<i>What's Happening!</i>

15:01.034 --> 15:03.268
...William "The Refrigerator"
Perry, everyone!

15:03.270 --> 15:05.403
...Newman from <i>Seinfeld.</i>

15:05.405 --> 15:07.205
...the whale from <i>Whale Rider.</i>

15:07.207 --> 15:09.507
...Adele!
(laughs)

15:09.509 --> 15:11.509
What? She's a guest star?!

15:11.511 --> 15:13.444
(sobbing)

15:13.446 --> 15:14.946
(groans)

15:14.948 --> 15:16.581
(static hissing)

15:16.583 --> 15:20.285
So that's why all
my cameramen have PTSD.

15:20.287 --> 15:22.420
Where's my whiskey funnel?!

15:22.422 --> 15:25.056
(German accent):
Young man, you should go.

15:25.058 --> 15:28.526
When the master is like this,
it is no place for children.

15:28.528 --> 15:30.194
Pour, Helga!

15:30.196 --> 15:31.930
It begins.

15:31.932 --> 15:34.499
(gulping)

15:38.704 --> 15:40.872
(angelic choir singing)

15:42.107 --> 15:44.909
Whoa. Where am I?

15:44.911 --> 15:46.544
Why, you're in
Jewish Heaven.

15:46.546 --> 15:47.745
Oh, this place is great.

15:47.747 --> 15:50.148
Why, my necktie
straightens itself.

15:50.150 --> 15:53.084
Even Portnoy has no complaints.

15:53.086 --> 15:55.787
And I tell you,
I get so much respect.

15:55.789 --> 15:58.389
Wow. So I made it to Heaven.

15:58.391 --> 16:00.158
(klezmer playing)

16:03.996 --> 16:06.197
(crowd cheering)

16:10.903 --> 16:12.837
This place is amazing!

16:12.839 --> 16:15.573
Schmuck,
there's no Jewish Heaven.

16:15.575 --> 16:17.675
Our faith teaches us
that once you're dead,

16:17.677 --> 16:20.011
that's it, kaput.
It's dark, it's cold.

16:20.013 --> 16:21.679
It's like that apartment
we lived in

16:21.681 --> 16:23.247
before I started
doing weddings.

16:23.249 --> 16:25.883
But you, my son,
remain...

16:28.654 --> 16:30.989
Eh?!
(groans)

16:30.991 --> 16:32.590
Go back to Earth.

16:32.592 --> 16:35.426
Do something with your life.
Help people.

16:35.428 --> 16:37.161
(echoing):
<i>Help people. Help people.</i>

16:37.163 --> 16:38.830
<i>Help people.</i>

16:38.832 --> 16:40.698
Nothing. I'm not
getting a pulse.

16:40.700 --> 16:41.699
(gasps)

16:41.701 --> 16:43.501
I got to change my life!

16:43.503 --> 16:44.969
Still no pulse.

16:44.971 --> 16:47.171
I guess I'm just
really bad at this.

16:51.610 --> 16:55.847
WOMAN:
♪ Someone to watch

16:55.849 --> 17:00.985
♪ Over me.

17:00.987 --> 17:02.987
I'm afraid
Lisa's getting obsessed

17:02.989 --> 17:04.822
with keeping her father
out of danger.

17:04.824 --> 17:08.159
She's gotten our Resusci Annie
doll to breathe on its own.

17:08.161 --> 17:10.661
(wheezes)
Why?

17:10.663 --> 17:13.131
In this new shelter,
we provide a home

17:13.133 --> 17:16.968
for animals put out of work
by Cirque du Soleil.

17:16.970 --> 17:18.569
(gorilla growls)

17:18.571 --> 17:20.004
Um, Krusty,

17:20.006 --> 17:22.306
have you fulfilled the promise
you made to your father

17:22.308 --> 17:24.909
in the dream you never
told anyone about?

17:24.911 --> 17:26.144
Uh, no.

17:26.146 --> 17:28.980
Somehow a brief act
of uncharacteristic generosity

17:28.982 --> 17:30.581
solved nothing.

17:30.583 --> 17:31.883
Hey, Krusty.
What?

17:31.885 --> 17:33.551
Have you been
going to temple?

17:33.553 --> 17:37.221
Yeah, and I've learned that all
religions are equally boring.

17:37.223 --> 17:39.157
But there's a reason I went.

17:39.159 --> 17:40.191
Come and see.

17:40.193 --> 17:42.360
Kid, there's no way
you can cheer me up.

17:42.362 --> 17:45.496
Not when whiskey, good
deeds and hookers failed.

17:45.498 --> 17:46.898
Who's a hooker?

17:46.900 --> 17:51.135
Uh, with me, it's easier to say
which ones aren't hookers.

17:53.172 --> 17:54.272
Hmm?

17:54.274 --> 17:55.940
(grunting)

17:55.942 --> 17:57.442
Lisa, what are you doing?

17:57.444 --> 17:58.843
Wrapping you in bubble wrap.

17:58.845 --> 18:01.913
I can't always be around
to protect you, so it will.

18:01.915 --> 18:03.714
But...

18:03.716 --> 18:04.782
(bubble wrap popping)

18:04.784 --> 18:05.850
Oh, Lisa, honey,

18:05.852 --> 18:08.386
you can't insulate yourself
from life.

18:08.388 --> 18:11.889
Why, I could live till 100
or a bus could hit me tomorrow.

18:11.891 --> 18:16.027
That's why I never plan
more than four seconds ahead.

18:16.029 --> 18:18.296
Oh, I guess
you're right.

18:18.298 --> 18:21.466
Now come on.
Give Daddy a hug.

18:21.468 --> 18:23.367
(grunting, bubble wrap popping)

18:23.369 --> 18:25.436
Bubble wrap!

18:25.438 --> 18:26.871
(bubble wrap popping)

18:26.873 --> 18:29.740
Your daughterly love
saved me, sweetie.

18:29.742 --> 18:32.910
That's all I wanted,
a tiny bit of control.

18:32.912 --> 18:35.980
Ooh. I suppose we should
exchange insurance information.

18:35.982 --> 18:37.281
I don't have any.

18:37.283 --> 18:38.116
Me neither.

18:38.118 --> 18:39.484
Then we have the same company.

18:39.486 --> 18:41.686
They'll work it all out.

18:42.454 --> 18:44.489
(tires screeching)

18:46.892 --> 18:48.426
(quietly):
Rabbi Rudenstein.

18:48.428 --> 18:49.760
Your father's favorite.

18:49.762 --> 18:51.762
Today's reading
is from Deuteronomy,

18:51.764 --> 18:53.898
which I believe
is the study of deuters.

18:53.900 --> 18:55.266
(laughter)

18:55.268 --> 18:56.734
Hey, that's my joke.

18:56.736 --> 18:58.603
Eh, must be
a coincidence.

18:58.605 --> 18:59.971
Uh, but before we begin,

18:59.973 --> 19:02.306
I'd like to quote
the burning bush, which said,

19:02.308 --> 19:03.474
"Hey, put me out.

19:03.476 --> 19:05.409
How many talking bushes
do you think there are?"

19:05.411 --> 19:06.677
Hey-hey.

19:06.679 --> 19:08.012
(laughter)

19:08.014 --> 19:09.013
Me again.

19:09.015 --> 19:11.849
So if Dad loved
his jokes, then...

19:11.851 --> 19:13.751
Dad loved my jokes.

19:13.753 --> 19:15.186
(crying):
Oh...

19:15.188 --> 19:17.755
Yeah, I guess he just
hated your delivery.

19:17.757 --> 19:20.791
He loved my jokes.

19:20.793 --> 19:24.195
My father respected me
but could never tell me.

19:24.197 --> 19:26.998
<i>That's</i> Jewish Heaven.

I'll tell you, you're

Krusty, let's face it, you might
not be cutting-edge anymore,

20:11.744 --> 20:14.745
but your show still does
really great in that key demo

20:17.150 --> 20:18.416
(laughter)
Whoa.

20:18.418 --> 20:19.417
Of course, Krusty's responsible

20:19.419 --> 20:20.851
