01:43.417 --> 01:45.417
Brandon.

01:45.500 --> 01:46.500
You're not here
to play games.

01:46.583 --> 01:49.834
Reset time!

02:48.333 --> 02:49.792
Sir.

02:49.875 --> 02:51.542
Horse stance.

03:02.959 --> 03:05.417
Sir.

03:05.500 --> 03:06.667
Sir.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.083
Sir.

03:09.166 --> 03:11.208
-Class dismissed.
Sir.

03:11.291 --> 03:12.375
Good job.

03:29.625 --> 03:32.792
All right now, baby.
Let's roll.

03:32.875 --> 03:35.333
Show us what you got
Show us what you got.

03:40.792 --> 03:43.208
Whoo!

03:43.291 --> 03:44.750
What a way to start
this thing off.

03:50.625 --> 03:51.792
Go, go.

03:51.875 --> 03:53.667
Oh, I see y'all.

04:06.458 --> 04:08.291
Hey.

04:08.375 --> 04:12.166
Lunge toss.
Y'all gots to top that, baby.

04:12.250 --> 04:13.500
All right, guys, come on.

04:13.583 --> 04:15.041
What you got?

04:15.917 --> 04:17.709
Hey, okay.

04:17.791 --> 04:19.625
-Hey, hey, hey, okay.
Okay. Go. I see you.

04:19.709 --> 04:21.458
Hey, hey.

04:21.541 --> 04:23.291
I see you. I see you.
Okay, okay.

04:23.375 --> 04:24.500
Come on.

04:24.583 --> 04:25.709
Move up in the same spot.

04:28.250 --> 04:30.458
Now would you look
at the tag team.

04:32.750 --> 04:34.542
No, y'all can't
let this come out.

04:34.625 --> 04:35.875
Oh, baby.

04:35.959 --> 04:37.917
No, no, no.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.709
Let's go.

04:39.792 --> 04:41.333
I see you, girl.

04:41.417 --> 04:43.000
Oh!

04:43.583 --> 04:46.083
Ah. Oh...

04:47.875 --> 04:49.875
Yah-yah.

04:49.959 --> 04:51.458
Yah-yah with the fly-by.

04:51.542 --> 04:53.750
Taking something
crazy, baby.

04:54.750 --> 04:56.875
Mm, oh, hey, hey.

04:56.959 --> 04:59.834
-Yeah
Oh!

04:59.917 --> 05:02.750
Oh, no, she didn't.

05:02.834 --> 05:03.709
Let's go.
Get her.

05:03.792 --> 05:05.625
Look at this. This is amazing.

05:08.542 --> 05:11.542
Now we got ourselves
a competition tonight, y'all.

05:11.625 --> 05:13.500
What else y'all got?

05:16.250 --> 05:19.375
Hold on, man.
I got this.

05:19.458 --> 05:20.667
Seriously?

05:20.750 --> 05:22.208
Take it.

05:22.291 --> 05:25.542
Don't worry,
it's all gravy, baby.

05:25.625 --> 05:26.875
Every time.

05:30.417 --> 05:31.709
-Turn that off.

05:31.792 --> 05:32.375
What are y'all doing in here?

05:32.458 --> 05:34.333
Y'all on private property.

05:34.417 --> 05:35.625
Y'all trespassing!

05:35.709 --> 05:37.083
Y'all got to roll out.

05:37.166 --> 05:38.792
Don't be looking at me.
Get out of here.

05:38.875 --> 05:40.417
Just go!
See you, college boy.

05:40.500 --> 05:41.917
Bye, Brandon!

05:42.458 --> 05:44.917
I can't believe you.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.875
You got all these people in here
with shoes on.

05:46.959 --> 05:47.667
What if somebody got hurt?

05:47.750 --> 05:50.792
That would be
my responsibility.

05:50.875 --> 05:52.583
No one would have got hurt.

05:52.667 --> 05:53.083
We were just dancing.

05:53.166 --> 05:55.291
Oh, just dancing.

05:55.375 --> 05:56.208
Well, excuse the hell
out of me.

05:56.291 --> 05:59.417
You need to get serious, son.

05:59.500 --> 06:02.083
Ain't no time for fun
and games in college.

06:02.166 --> 06:03.583
You said you wanted
to be a researcher.

06:03.667 --> 06:06.041
What do you gonna do,
research dance moves?

06:07.458 --> 06:07.667
Oh, something funny?

06:07.750 --> 06:08.917
No.

06:09.000 --> 06:12.583
You better focus, boy.

06:12.667 --> 06:15.583
I want you to clean up this mess
your friends left you.

06:15.667 --> 06:18.041
No TV, no car, no computer,

06:18.125 --> 06:20.792
no phone, no nothing.

06:20.875 --> 06:22.709
Are you serious? How am I
supposed to get anything done?

06:22.792 --> 06:24.000
Oh, now you concerned
about getting stuff done.

06:24.083 --> 06:27.166
You should have ran that through
in your mind in the first place.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.917
I'm disappointed
in you.

07:36.375 --> 07:38.709
I'm going to make you proud.

08:17.208 --> 08:19.166
You need some help with that?

08:19.250 --> 08:20.583
-No, I'm good.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.000
Yeah.

08:27.583 --> 08:29.625
So I guess I'm there?

08:29.709 --> 08:32.582
Yeah, yeah. But, I mean,
if you wanted to switch sides,

08:32.667 --> 08:33.917
I can easily move.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.582
No, it's okay.

08:35.667 --> 08:37.125
Okay. Uh...

08:37.207 --> 08:38.917
yeah, some boxes came by
this morning.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.166
I just put them
over there.

08:42.917 --> 08:46.083
Yeah, sorry, you never answered
any of my emails,

08:46.166 --> 08:48.750
so I just--
I chose a side.

08:48.834 --> 08:50.667
It's cool.

08:50.750 --> 08:52.000
So you're from Vegas?

08:52.083 --> 08:54.625
Yup.

08:54.709 --> 08:55.417
Prostitution's free.

08:55.500 --> 08:58.834
I mean, it's legal
over there.

08:58.917 --> 09:00.834
Yeah.

09:00.917 --> 09:04.875
I was going to try to make a
prostitution joke or something,

09:04.959 --> 09:06.375
-but...

09:08.000 --> 09:09.583
No, no. I...

09:09.667 --> 09:10.375
Just forget it, yeah.

09:10.458 --> 09:13.583
-Come in.

09:13.667 --> 09:15.834
Hey. I'm Rosalie.

09:15.917 --> 09:17.291
Hi. Yeah.
I'm Nate.

09:17.375 --> 09:19.333
You're our RA.
Yeah.

09:19.417 --> 09:21.959
I researched you
on Instagram.

09:22.041 --> 09:25.792
I just want to let you know
that I too am a fan

09:25.875 --> 09:27.625
of little succulents.

09:27.709 --> 09:30.083
-Yeah.

09:30.166 --> 09:32.000
You must be Brandon.

09:32.083 --> 09:32.750
Hi.

09:32.834 --> 09:34.875
I'm also your biochemistry TA.

09:34.959 --> 09:35.875
And that class
is a beast,

09:35.959 --> 09:37.959
but I'm around if you need
any extra help.

09:38.041 --> 09:41.500
Hey. How can I get
in that class?

09:41.583 --> 09:43.250
You couldn't handle it.

09:45.959 --> 09:48.917
Oh, I also want to let you know
about the first night party.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.291
It's downstairs at 11:00.

09:50.375 --> 09:51.166
Oh, who's all going?

09:51.250 --> 09:53.500
Well, first-years.

09:53.583 --> 09:55.291
Are they all
as gorgeous as you?

09:55.375 --> 09:59.250
Uh... see you later.

09:59.333 --> 10:01.166
Yeah. Count on it.

10:07.875 --> 10:09.417
I felt a connection.

10:23.166 --> 10:23.792
You coming?

10:25.834 --> 10:27.625
Nope.

10:27.709 --> 10:29.500
You'll get dibs
on all the first-years.

10:29.583 --> 10:31.041
Yeah, you sure you want
to wear

10:31.125 --> 10:32.250
What?

10:32.333 --> 10:35.208
Never mind.

10:51.542 --> 10:52.917
No, no, it's just pretty cool.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.542
It's pretty cool. I kind of like
this a little bit better.

10:56.625 --> 10:58.208
And it's all right,
it's all right.

10:58.291 --> 11:00.542
But you should come
see it sometime.

11:01.709 --> 11:04.417
Hey. You should go.

11:06.917 --> 11:08.291
It's lame.

11:22.333 --> 11:24.458
Don't ask.

11:30.291 --> 11:33.250
Many reactions proceed
to a lower energy state

11:33.333 --> 11:35.834
and are thus favored
thermodynamically.

11:35.917 --> 11:39.208
Your text gives three examples
of this.

11:39.291 --> 11:41.333
One: a hydrolysis
of starch to glucose.

11:41.417 --> 11:44.250
And two others.

11:44.333 --> 11:45.834
Name them.

11:49.208 --> 11:52.834
Come on. Anyone.

11:52.917 --> 11:54.291
-Hi, Professor Schmidt.

11:54.375 --> 11:56.375
I'm Maddie Beeber.

11:56.458 --> 11:57.542
So excited to be here.

11:57.625 --> 12:00.458
So I just wanted to remind you

12:00.542 --> 12:02.625
that today is the first day
of class,

12:02.709 --> 12:05.083
so no one has done
any reading yet.

12:06.959 --> 12:11.291
If you wish to whimper
about the requirements,

12:11.375 --> 12:12.959
you could go down the hall
to Biology 101

12:13.041 --> 12:19.125
with the rest of the woefully
unprepared students.

12:19.208 --> 12:20.834
Leave.

12:20.917 --> 12:22.959
You heard me.

12:29.208 --> 12:31.083
Yes?

12:31.166 --> 12:34.000
The splitting of phosphate
groups from other phosphates

12:34.083 --> 12:35.208
is one example, sir.

12:35.291 --> 12:37.125
Correct.

12:37.208 --> 12:40.125
And the rearranging of glucose
to fructose is another.

12:40.208 --> 12:41.417
Also true.

12:41.500 --> 12:43.500
This is not a class
for students

12:43.583 --> 12:47.375
unwilling to take the initiative
in understanding these concepts

12:47.458 --> 12:49.375
without me
holding your hand.

12:49.458 --> 12:52.208
I just want to emphasize

12:52.291 --> 12:54.083
that reactions
are reversible.

12:54.166 --> 12:57.166
They can be coupled so that
energy from one drives another.

12:57.250 --> 12:59.417
Also true.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.041
Uh, this class is over
when I say it's over.

13:13.208 --> 13:14.959
Class dismissed.

13:21.542 --> 13:23.250
Hey, come check us out.

All right, come here.
Here's some inspiration.

14:39.959 --> 14:42.041
[hip-hop music playing
over computer]

14:49.375 --> 14:51.291
-Oh!
-They're good.

15:01.583 --> 15:03.041
Oh...

15:04.125 --> 15:05.417
So hot.

15:06.458 --> 15:07.083
So I saw your video.

15:07.166 --> 15:09.250
You're just now seeing it?

15:09.333 --> 15:10.834
I sent that to you
so long ago.

15:10.917 --> 15:12.917
That's not the point.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.041
You and Dante
look really close,

15:15.125 --> 15:15.792
for a girl with a boyfriend,

15:15.875 --> 15:18.542
Oh, so now you're my boyfriend?

15:18.625 --> 15:20.458
Because you don't
act like it.

15:20.542 --> 15:22.166
What's that supposed to mean?

15:22.250 --> 15:24.000
Not everything's
the Brandon Show.

15:24.083 --> 15:26.542
You think we were going to stop
being a crew

15:26.625 --> 15:28.250
because you decided
to leave?

15:30.083 --> 15:30.542
I got to go.

15:30.625 --> 15:32.208
Of course you do.

15:36.250 --> 15:37.542
Did you hear about that girl

15:37.625 --> 15:39.417
who got kicked out
of Biochem?

15:52.333 --> 15:54.250
You are the most
depressing roommate

15:54.333 --> 15:56.166
in the history
of roommates.

15:56.250 --> 15:57.750
You barely talk
to anyone,

15:57.834 --> 15:59.625
and you keep watching
that dance video

15:59.709 --> 16:01.792
over and over again.

16:03.792 --> 16:05.875
Listen, I know your girlfriend
dumped you, and it sucks,

16:05.959 --> 16:07.417
but I've been dumped
like a million times.

16:07.500 --> 16:08.208
How do you know
about that?

16:10.458 --> 16:12.041
Listen, I'm going to drive
to the mall.

16:12.125 --> 16:14.625
-No.

16:14.709 --> 16:16.500
Come on. I know you're tired
of cafeteria food.

16:16.583 --> 16:18.208
Get up.

16:35.542 --> 16:37.208
Hey, you here alone?

16:37.291 --> 16:37.875
That's a lot of bags.

16:37.959 --> 16:40.959
I can...
I can carry them.

16:41.041 --> 16:42.250
-Some of them.
I'm good.

17:12.165 --> 17:15.375
Turns out that she had
a "boyfriend."

17:15.458 --> 17:16.208
You know, so...

17:31.875 --> 17:35.375
So, we got to spread the word.

17:35.458 --> 17:38.041
What are you
talking about?

17:38.125 --> 17:39.333
Your dance crew.

17:39.417 --> 17:41.125
-Come on.

17:41.208 --> 17:45.291
You need a new dance crew,
so let's get you one.

17:46.542 --> 17:47.583
It's not that easy.

17:47.667 --> 17:48.583
Yes, it is.

17:48.667 --> 17:51.458
Look, I can help.

17:51.542 --> 17:53.917
Why would you
want to help?

17:55.458 --> 17:56.625
Well...

17:56.709 --> 17:58.542
-Women.
-Women.

18:01.834 --> 18:03.750
Look, Nate,
you can't trust people.

18:03.834 --> 18:05.834
I learned that
with my old crew, Levelz.

18:05.917 --> 18:07.208
Plus, I got
schoolwork to do.

18:07.291 --> 18:10.542
Well, it should work
if you just take it out

18:10.625 --> 18:12.709
of your sleeping
and moping time.

18:14.917 --> 18:17.000
It's a joke.

18:17.083 --> 18:19.375
Look, there's just
no talent here.

18:21.250 --> 18:22.834
There's plenty
of talent here.

18:26.709 --> 18:29.917
Okay, thank you guys
for coming to the auditions.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.875
Um, we will not be doing
choreography.

18:31.959 --> 18:34.208
Instead, you're going
to own your moves,

18:34.291 --> 18:36.333
keep your head high,
and battle.

18:36.417 --> 18:37.709
Take it away.

18:44.375 --> 18:46.208
Number one, go.

18:47.458 --> 18:47.834
Hey.

18:47.917 --> 18:50.625
Hey, let's go.

18:52.709 --> 18:54.375
All right. Number two.

18:55.375 --> 18:56.667
You got this.

18:56.750 --> 18:58.667
Come on.

18:58.750 --> 19:00.333
Take it.

19:02.166 --> 19:04.166
A little more.
All right.

19:04.250 --> 19:05.417
All right. All right.

19:08.333 --> 19:09.542
Hey!

19:10.959 --> 19:12.417
Okay.

19:12.500 --> 19:15.083
Enough, enough, enough.

19:15.166 --> 19:16.750
All right, enough,
enough, enough.

19:19.709 --> 19:21.917
Okay.

19:44.792 --> 19:46.750
I appreciate everyone
for coming.

19:46.834 --> 19:48.834
We will get back to you.

19:51.333 --> 19:52.709
Great. Great, right?

19:54.834 --> 19:56.500
Oh, man.

19:57.208 --> 19:59.875
We've got to keep
looking.

19:59.959 --> 20:02.000
-Yeah. This is a bad idea.
-Okay, well,

20:02.083 --> 20:06.542
next time just try teaching
choreography.

20:06.625 --> 20:09.834
Okay, okay, I know, I have
no idea what I'm talking about.

20:09.917 --> 20:11.959
Look, the purpose
of a dance crew

20:12.041 --> 20:14.125
is to find people
who do their own thing.

20:14.208 --> 20:14.875
They got to have
their own style.

20:14.959 --> 20:17.542
Well, if that's the case,

20:17.625 --> 20:19.333
then we're going to just
have to find these people.

20:19.417 --> 20:21.834
I mean, they're not going
to come to us.

20:41.792 --> 20:45.458
We're looking for research
assistants over at Pennington.

20:45.542 --> 20:47.834
It's for a new clinical trial
we're starting up.

20:47.917 --> 20:48.792
It's work study,
so you'll get paid.

20:48.875 --> 20:51.542
Not much...

20:51.625 --> 20:55.542
but you'll have the undying
respect of all your peers.

20:58.500 --> 21:00.250
Oh, come by
Friday at 10:00.

21:00.333 --> 21:01.625
We'll get you acclimated.

21:01.709 --> 21:02.834
Thank you so much.

21:02.917 --> 21:06.500
And I was just wondering,
about our tests, if you would...

21:06.583 --> 21:08.667
Oh, yes,
Miss Dhawan.

21:08.750 --> 21:09.875
Yes.

21:09.959 --> 21:11.792
You both made A's.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.583
See? We're good.

21:14.667 --> 21:15.500
Don't be over here
worried about nothing.

21:15.583 --> 21:17.750
Sir.

21:17.834 --> 21:19.500
-Sir.
-Sir.

21:21.500 --> 21:22.709
Fight!

21:27.458 --> 21:28.959
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

21:29.041 --> 21:30.834
Continue without any contact,
okay?

21:30.917 --> 21:33.500
-Sir.
-Sir.

21:33.583 --> 21:35.750
-No contact.
-Sir.

21:35.834 --> 21:37.542
Hello?

21:37.625 --> 21:39.166
Hey, Dad.

21:39.250 --> 21:40.083
I got asked to be
research assistant.

21:40.166 --> 21:42.625
What? That's good news,
Brandon!

21:42.709 --> 21:46.542
Yeah. Professor Schmidt
was pretty impressed by me.

21:46.625 --> 21:47.208
Wow.

21:47.291 --> 21:49.750
Brandon, I'm proud of you.

21:49.834 --> 21:52.041
That's great news.
When does this happen?

21:56.208 --> 21:57.792
Brandon, are you...
are you still there?

21:57.875 --> 22:00.375
-Hey, Dad, let me...
-I can't even hear you.

22:00.458 --> 22:01.041
Let me call you back.

22:01.125 --> 22:03.875
When did this happen...?

22:03.959 --> 22:05.458
Hello?

22:05.542 --> 22:07.500
Brandon?

22:43.000 --> 22:45.542
Okay, the art department
loves this guy.

22:50.083 --> 22:53.375
Pretty good, right?

22:54.792 --> 22:55.208
-Okay.

22:55.291 --> 22:57.000
-Ooh!
-Yeah.

22:57.083 --> 22:58.625
-He's...
-Yeah.

22:58.709 --> 23:00.667

Okay. Sure.

25:21.709 --> 25:23.333
Hey!

25:24.333 --> 25:26.333
Hey.

25:31.291 --> 25:32.792
Hey, hey, hey.

25:32.875 --> 25:34.000
I'm not sure
about this.

25:34.083 --> 25:34.834
Trust me.

25:39.250 --> 25:41.709
Whoa.

25:41.792 --> 25:43.750
She is never going
to join this crew.

25:43.834 --> 25:45.959
I got this.

25:57.667 --> 25:59.125
Found her.

26:20.709 --> 26:22.709
I'm sorry,
can I help you?

26:22.792 --> 26:25.250
Uh... oh.

26:26.834 --> 26:28.333
I remember you
from class.

26:28.417 --> 26:31.083
-Yeah.
-You guys...

26:31.166 --> 26:32.166
you sort of stood around.

26:32.250 --> 26:33.625
It was creepy.

26:33.709 --> 26:35.792
That's a good one.

26:35.875 --> 26:37.667
Yeah, yeah.

26:37.750 --> 26:40.875
I wanted to talk to you
about something.

26:43.000 --> 26:43.417
Well, it's...

26:45.291 --> 26:46.709
...it's just that...

26:46.792 --> 26:49.000
you are so beautiful.

26:49.083 --> 26:51.709
Okay, okay,

26:51.792 --> 26:53.291
you know,
what do you want?

26:53.375 --> 26:55.333
Okay, look, my friend
Brandon and I,

26:55.417 --> 26:56.750
we're starting
this dance crew,

26:56.834 --> 26:58.083
and we want you
to be in it.

27:02.875 --> 27:03.959
Are you a dancer?

27:07.125 --> 27:09.041
No. No, I'm more like...

27:09.125 --> 27:10.208
I'm more like the manager.

27:10.291 --> 27:13.625
-Hmm.
-Yeah. Yeah.

27:13.709 --> 27:15.709
And how old are you?

27:15.792 --> 27:17.875
Age is just a number.

27:19.667 --> 27:21.834
Do you know how old I am?

27:21.917 --> 27:24.333
I don't know, 25?

27:25.250 --> 27:25.834
That's sweet.

27:25.917 --> 27:27.083
No, yeah,
I'm in my 30s.

27:27.166 --> 27:29.917
Okay. Yeah.

27:30.000 --> 27:31.208
And I just...

27:31.291 --> 27:34.792
I can't do it.

27:34.875 --> 27:36.000
Why not?

27:38.500 --> 27:41.333
It's-- this is just--
okay, this is strange, okay?

27:41.417 --> 27:43.000
-And, you know...
-Just hear me out.

27:43.083 --> 27:46.875
The crew is people
who do all kinds of dance,

27:46.959 --> 27:48.291
and it's just for fun.

27:48.375 --> 27:51.166
Brandon is an amazing dancer.

27:51.250 --> 27:52.750
His old crew Levelz
is huge.

27:52.834 --> 27:56.250
You can see a bunch
of their old stuff online.

27:56.333 --> 27:58.500
I mean, it's legit,
I swear.

28:00.083 --> 28:01.291
Look, it...

28:01.375 --> 28:03.125
come to one rehearsal.

28:03.208 --> 28:06.125
One. And if you don't
like it...

28:06.208 --> 28:08.333
don't come back.

28:30.333 --> 28:32.083
Yo, Professor Schmidt
told us to come here for...

28:32.166 --> 28:34.166
Oh, yeah.

28:34.250 --> 28:35.208
You're the new
minions.

28:35.291 --> 28:38.959
Grab that box of raspberries
and get started.

28:41.375 --> 28:43.125
Wash them thoroughly,
and when you're done

28:43.208 --> 28:45.041
I'll show you
what to do next.

28:45.125 --> 28:46.959
Okay.

29:08.417 --> 29:10.458
I cannot believe I signed up
to work at Jamba Juice.

29:10.542 --> 29:13.333
It's just the first day.

29:21.208 --> 29:23.500
Hey, um...

29:23.583 --> 29:25.500
can I sneak out?

29:25.583 --> 29:27.792
I don't care.

29:27.875 --> 29:31.542
Oh, they're for
a dance class.

29:33.291 --> 29:35.000
Hmm.

29:35.083 --> 29:37.875
Four, five, six, seven, eight.

29:37.959 --> 29:42.166
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

29:42.250 --> 29:43.500
One, two, three, four,

29:43.583 --> 29:46.875
five, six, seven, eight.

29:46.959 --> 29:51.250
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

29:51.333 --> 29:54.125
-Thank you guys so much
for class.

29:54.208 --> 29:57.208
And let's give a round of
applause to our guest, Brandon.

29:57.291 --> 30:00.208
Whoo!

30:00.291 --> 30:01.875
And Nate, of course.

30:03.458 --> 30:05.417
Nate.

30:07.542 --> 30:10.875
Yo, you are amazing.

30:10.959 --> 30:12.250
Thanks.

30:12.333 --> 30:13.333
I'm starting this
new dance crew.

30:13.417 --> 30:15.834
You got to be in it.

30:15.917 --> 30:17.166
A dance crew?

30:17.250 --> 30:20.041
I mean, I only really
do bhangra.

30:20.125 --> 30:20.542
But you don't know that.

30:20.625 --> 30:23.125
Well, I guess not.

30:23.208 --> 30:24.875
Please, please, please.
You have been practicing

30:24.959 --> 30:27.625
those formation steps at home
for months now.

30:29.083 --> 30:31.583
I have so much
studying to do.

30:31.667 --> 30:34.375
Okay, at least come
to the first rehearsal.

30:34.458 --> 30:36.041
Okay.

30:36.125 --> 30:37.625
-Oh!

30:39.291 --> 30:40.750
This is going to be great.

30:42.709 --> 30:45.667
You really... yeah,
I wish I could. I wish I could.

30:47.208 --> 30:50.875
You know, the guy who could
juggle the hats was amazing.

30:50.959 --> 30:54.333
I mean, that's a skill
you could use.

30:57.333 --> 30:59.083
Hello.

31:01.166 --> 31:02.959
Hello. Earth to Brandon.

31:04.333 --> 31:06.583
Come in.

31:08.125 --> 31:11.542
Just reminding you boys
that we leave in five minutes

31:11.625 --> 31:13.417
to head over to my friend's
pep rally.

31:13.500 --> 31:15.250
You'll be sorely disappointed
if you miss it.

31:15.333 --> 31:17.625
I think I'll pass.
I have a lot of work to do.

31:17.709 --> 31:20.834
Yeah, I think I'll pass too.

31:20.917 --> 31:22.917
I might just stay in,

31:23.000 --> 31:25.458
find a glass of wine.

31:25.542 --> 31:27.583
Read some Salinger.

31:28.959 --> 31:31.083
Listen, I can see you're not
having much fun.

31:31.166 --> 31:33.583
And the adjustment
to college life is hard

31:33.667 --> 31:35.500
for a lot of out-of-state
students.

31:35.583 --> 31:38.041
So come on, relax.

31:38.125 --> 31:39.291
Please.

31:39.375 --> 31:41.250
Okay, okay.

31:41.333 --> 31:43.333
Fine.

31:43.417 --> 31:46.834
I'm really flattered that
you want me to go this badly.

31:46.917 --> 31:49.166
I'll clear my schedule.

31:49.250 --> 31:52.792
Yes. You and everyone else
on the floor.

32:09.375 --> 32:11.500
Welcome, welcome, fans.

32:11.583 --> 32:13.333
Our very own Sweethearts
are here

32:13.417 --> 32:15.333
to start the weekend
off right.

32:15.417 --> 32:21.041
And then we're introducing
your 2017 men's basketball team.

32:22.750 --> 32:25.542
You see our fierce sister,
Dee Dee.

32:25.625 --> 32:28.041
Whoo!

32:29.083 --> 32:30.500
Go, Dee Dee!

32:33.291 --> 32:36.083
This is lame.
I'm getting the car.

32:39.917 --> 32:41.667
The band and our Sweethearts

32:41.750 --> 32:45.709
just scalped the competition
in the ATL Classic.

32:45.792 --> 32:47.542
Bring us some love
today, fans.

32:50.291 --> 32:52.250
That's right, even more.

32:55.500 --> 32:57.583
Come on, keep it coming.

33:02.083 --> 33:03.500
Nate.

33:03.583 --> 33:05.041
Hey, car's four minutes away.
We got to go.

33:05.125 --> 33:07.083
I can't get another
bad review.

33:07.166 --> 33:09.542
Look at her.

33:09.625 --> 33:12.166
She is...perfect.

33:14.125 --> 33:17.625
Ladies, let's show the fans
how much we love them.

33:17.709 --> 33:19.542
We've got to have her join.

33:19.625 --> 33:21.375
Yeah.

33:27.000 --> 33:28.417
What's up?

33:28.500 --> 33:31.667
Are you ready to meet
this year's team?

33:31.750 --> 33:32.500
-I'm going to go talk to her.
-All right.

33:32.583 --> 33:34.750
Just...

33:36.375 --> 33:38.458
6'6" sophomore

33:38.542 --> 33:39.542
from Miami, Florida...

33:39.625 --> 33:41.500
Taj Key.

33:43.166 --> 33:44.959
Excuse me.

33:45.041 --> 33:46.917
I don't mean
to interrupt.

33:47.000 --> 33:50.250
Well, I do,
but not stop you.

33:50.333 --> 33:51.834
Well, you're stopped now.

33:51.917 --> 33:56.333
My name is Brandon.
I appreciate your talent.

33:56.417 --> 33:58.417
I'm looking to assemble
the best dancers in Baton Rouge

33:58.500 --> 34:01.583
for a new crew,
and I'd love for you to join.

34:01.667 --> 34:03.333
Not to brag or anything,

34:03.417 --> 34:05.750
but I have won
some national battles.

34:05.834 --> 34:07.959
You could check out
me and my crew Levelz online.

34:08.041 --> 34:10.125
Lark, I know he did not
just tell you

34:10.208 --> 34:11.583
you can Google him.

34:11.667 --> 34:12.458
Can't be.

34:12.542 --> 34:14.792
Lark.

34:14.875 --> 34:16.417
Huh.

34:16.500 --> 34:17.625
Well, at least come
to an audition,

34:17.708 --> 34:19.458
or a rehearsal,

34:19.542 --> 34:21.333
so you can see
that I'm real.

34:23.291 --> 34:25.500
From sunny Santa Monica,
California,

34:25.583 --> 34:28.417
Milly Gilbert...

34:31.458 --> 34:32.458
Oh, okay.

34:32.542 --> 34:34.667
Check out the Southern
Sweethearts.

34:34.750 --> 34:37.875
Y'all looking good, ladies.

34:41.875 --> 34:44.375
If you say so, man.

35:19.917 --> 35:23.542
Okay, kids, leg up on the bar.

35:23.625 --> 35:26.208
And stretch
towards the bar.

35:26.291 --> 35:28.250
And back to center.

35:29.625 --> 35:32.291
Excuse me, this is
a beginners' class.

35:32.375 --> 35:35.041
Well, then I'm in luck,
because I'm a beginner.

35:35.125 --> 35:37.291
I thought you were some
big-time dancer.

35:37.375 --> 35:40.834
And you don't even know
the fundamentals of ballet.

35:40.917 --> 35:42.917
I mean, I am
a street dancer,

35:43.000 --> 35:45.375
but even though
it's a little different,

35:45.458 --> 35:47.125
you're never too old
to learn.

35:47.208 --> 35:49.500
Well, we're pretty far along
in the session,

35:49.583 --> 35:53.333
and they already know
all the positions, and more.

35:53.417 --> 35:55.792
I guess we're just going to
have to see how much you know,

35:55.875 --> 35:57.917
and determine
if you can continue.

35:58.000 --> 35:59.792
You guys want
to see his moves?

35:59.875 --> 36:00.458
Yeah!

36:02.583 --> 36:04.792
Okay.

36:04.875 --> 36:07.792
All right, now,
go easy on me.

36:07.875 --> 36:09.458
I'm a little rusty.

36:23.375 --> 36:26.083
Not bad. Not bad.

36:26.166 --> 36:28.750
Any critiques
on his technique?

36:28.834 --> 36:30.625
Yes, Margot?

36:30.709 --> 36:32.125
He didn't do them
in order.

36:32.208 --> 36:34.000
You are absolutely right.

36:34.083 --> 36:36.917
Why don't we show him
the positions in order.

36:37.000 --> 36:37.750
Ready?

36:37.834 --> 36:40.625
Five, six, seven, eight.

36:40.709 --> 36:42.750
And first...

36:42.834 --> 36:44.250
second...

36:44.333 --> 36:45.834
fourth...

36:45.917 --> 36:46.583
and fifth.

36:46.667 --> 36:49.583
Good job.

36:49.667 --> 36:51.417
-Good job.

36:51.500 --> 36:53.500
Any other suggestions?

36:53.583 --> 36:56.375
He's not in proper attire.
Look at those pants.

36:56.458 --> 36:59.625
-And his socks don't match.

36:59.709 --> 37:02.667
Okay, okay, we're not critiquing
his fashion.

37:02.750 --> 37:04.834
We're critiquing
his technique.

37:04.917 --> 37:07.375
His arabesque
was terrible.

37:07.875 --> 37:08.959
Funny guy.

37:09.041 --> 37:11.458
Okay, leg up on arabesque.

37:15.625 --> 37:17.458
And straighten that knee.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.875
Arm out. And stretch.

37:23.959 --> 37:24.792
Stretch.

37:24.875 --> 37:28.208
How's that?

37:28.291 --> 37:28.959
Not terrible.

37:29.041 --> 37:31.875
Not terrible
is good enough.

37:31.959 --> 37:33.792
You can relax now.

37:35.583 --> 37:37.041
All right, guys,
that was a really good class,

37:37.125 --> 37:38.583
and I will see you all
next weekend.

37:41.166 --> 37:43.917
-Bye, guys.
Bye.

37:46.625 --> 37:51.458
So, those were some pretty, uh,
interesting ballet moves.

37:51.542 --> 37:53.959
Are we going to see you
again next weekend?

37:54.041 --> 37:56.458
I don't think so.
I don't have tights.

37:56.542 --> 37:58.500
And I'm pretty sure Jacob
will be a little upset

37:58.583 --> 37:59.709
if I show up without him.

37:59.792 --> 38:01.375
Oh, yes. Very true.

38:01.458 --> 38:04.834
He definitely keeps us
looking our best.

38:04.917 --> 38:06.417
Mm, I see.

38:06.500 --> 38:08.333
I'd like to see you again,
though.

38:08.417 --> 38:09.834
For a dance.

38:09.917 --> 38:11.709
Of course. Right.

38:11.792 --> 38:13.208
Yeah.

38:13.291 --> 38:14.625
They don't have
dancing like that

38:14.709 --> 38:16.375
at pep rallies
back where I'm from.

38:16.458 --> 38:16.959
Vegas.

38:17.041 --> 38:19.667
But you do ballet too.

38:19.750 --> 38:21.917
That's, like,
totally different modes.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.625
Yeah, well, I mean,
ballet doesn't really require

38:24.709 --> 38:27.375
a serious dance face,
like the Sweethearts.

38:27.458 --> 38:29.333
Yes. Dance face.

38:29.417 --> 38:31.041
After all, you got to be
in beast mode.

38:31.125 --> 38:33.542
-Totally in the zone.

38:33.625 --> 38:36.041
Well, look,
I'm starting this crew,

38:36.125 --> 38:38.875
and I'd love for you
to be in it.

38:39.959 --> 38:41.333
But I don't dance
like you.

38:41.417 --> 38:42.917
Hey, that's perfect.

38:43.000 --> 38:44.417
I'm trying to do something new
with this dance crew.

38:44.500 --> 38:46.792
Something that's never
been done before.

38:46.875 --> 38:48.083
Ah.

38:48.166 --> 38:51.333
Everything has been
done before.

38:52.750 --> 38:54.375
At least come
to the first rehearsal.

38:54.458 --> 38:57.750
I actually think
I still have the flier.

38:57.834 --> 38:59.375
Is the address the same?

38:59.458 --> 39:01.542
Yes. Huh.

39:01.625 --> 39:03.959
So you were actually
listening to me.

39:04.041 --> 39:04.917
It's funny, because I really
couldn't tell.

39:05.000 --> 39:06.625
Ah, ahem.

39:07.959 --> 39:09.875
Dance face.

39:12.166 --> 39:14.083
But Dee Dee
also Googled you.

39:14.166 --> 39:16.917
Made us watch
all of your videos.

39:17.000 --> 39:18.583
Mm, okay.

39:18.667 --> 39:20.959
See? I'm not a creep.
I'm legit.

39:21.041 --> 39:24.291
So, when are the
first rehearsals?

39:24.375 --> 39:27.083
Um...
7:00 p.m. on Tuesday.

39:27.166 --> 39:28.583
Nice.

39:28.667 --> 39:31.083
-Sounds good.

39:31.166 --> 39:33.208
For sure.

39:37.375 --> 39:39.917
All right, thank you guys
all for coming.

39:40.000 --> 39:41.667
Just follow after me.

39:41.750 --> 39:43.166
Five, six, seven, and...

39:49.542 --> 39:51.917
Five, six, seven, and...

39:53.542 --> 39:53.792
Hey, hey.

39:59.792 --> 40:02.333
I think it'll help if you
break down the combination

40:02.417 --> 40:03.792
into smaller sections.

40:03.875 --> 40:05.959
Maybe start
with an eight count.

40:06.041 --> 40:07.542
Okay, um...

40:07.625 --> 40:11.542
I'm going to take it slow
for you guys.

40:12.917 --> 40:15.333
Follow along.

40:15.417 --> 40:17.875
Five, six, seven,
and step.

40:17.959 --> 40:19.125
And step.

40:19.208 --> 40:21.166
And step. And step.

40:21.250 --> 40:23.667
And bring it back.

40:23.750 --> 40:26.750
One, two.
And pop-pop.

40:31.250 --> 40:32.917
Okay, okay.

40:33.000 --> 40:34.667
Now let's try some battling.

40:34.750 --> 40:36.625
Now, at any moment, an opponent
from the opposite team

40:36.709 --> 40:38.041
can come up
and challenge you,

40:38.125 --> 40:40.291
so you have to be ready.

40:40.375 --> 40:42.542
So then why don't you
just step in?

40:42.625 --> 40:44.000
Or are you scared?

40:44.083 --> 40:45.667
-Hmm.

41:09.917 --> 41:13.208
-♪ Get it, girl ♪
-♪ Get it, get it, get it ♪

41:13.291 --> 41:15.583
-♪ Get it, girl
-♪ Get it ♪

41:15.667 --> 41:17.083
♪ Get it, girl ♪

41:29.709 --> 41:33.709
Hey, I hate to be
the Danny Downer here, but...

41:33.792 --> 41:35.083
How are you doing?

41:35.166 --> 41:36.917
Yeah, our studio time's
almost up,

41:37.000 --> 41:39.709
so we got to get out of the way
for the Zumba class, so...

41:39.792 --> 41:40.709
Okay, okay.

41:40.792 --> 41:43.375
All right, guys,
thank you for coming again.

41:43.458 --> 41:46.166
I'll text you guys
next week.

41:46.250 --> 41:48.417
Oh, yeah, you know, I have to
check my kids' evening schedule.

41:48.500 --> 41:50.917
But we'll be in touch, okay?

41:51.000 --> 41:53.083
I'm not sure if I'll make
next rehearsal,

41:53.166 --> 41:55.250
but I'll take the hip-hop
aerobics in the gym, yeah?

41:55.333 --> 41:56.875
Yeah, it's not
an aerobics class.

41:56.959 --> 41:59.583
It's supposed
to be a dance crew.

41:59.667 --> 42:01.792
I'll see you in the lab, okay?

42:01.875 --> 42:03.959
-Mm-hmm.
-Bye.

42:05.375 --> 42:07.542
That was a...
that was a good first rehearsal.

42:07.625 --> 42:09.500
You call that a good
first rehearsal?

42:09.583 --> 42:10.959
It wasn't that bad.

42:11.041 --> 42:13.041
It could have been
so much worse.

42:13.125 --> 42:15.083
Like, you want my advice?

42:15.166 --> 42:17.250
But I feel like you're
gonna give it to me anyway.

42:17.333 --> 42:20.709
You need to try to find a way
to incorporate all the styles

42:20.792 --> 42:22.166
into one routine.

42:22.250 --> 42:23.750
Show them how
to use their skills.

42:23.834 --> 42:25.917
-I thought I did that.
-You need to try harder.

42:26.000 --> 42:27.000
They think
it's a dance class.

42:27.083 --> 42:30.667
You need to motivate them
to think like a team.

42:30.750 --> 42:33.041
Yes.
Practice makes perfect.

42:33.125 --> 42:34.709
Are you trying to sound
like my dad right now?

42:34.792 --> 42:38.041
Not really. Something my dad
says to all of his students.

42:38.125 --> 42:40.792
Oh. Okay, sensei.

42:42.458 --> 42:45.709
Put your dance face on
and you will be fine.

42:45.792 --> 42:48.208
Text me and let me know if
rehearsals are on for next week.

42:48.291 --> 42:50.709
Will do.

42:54.875 --> 42:56.166
It wasn't...

42:56.250 --> 42:59.917
-Bye, guys.
-Bye.

43:00.500 --> 43:02.875
It wasn't that bad.

43:02.959 --> 43:05.208
It was that bad.

43:05.750 --> 43:07.917
It wasn't that bad.

43:30.250 --> 43:32.667
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Scott.

43:32.750 --> 43:35.333
Is there someplace
you'd rather be?

43:35.417 --> 43:37.125
Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

43:37.208 --> 43:39.208
No, Mr. Schmidt.

43:40.250 --> 43:41.792
Good.

43:43.000 --> 43:44.834
I want to talk to you
after class.

43:46.417 --> 43:49.000
Now, back to our regularly
scheduled program

43:49.083 --> 43:52.000
of who gets meetings
with the TAs prior to testing,

43:52.083 --> 43:55.291
and who is left out
on a limb by themselves

43:55.375 --> 43:56.834
to freeze in the cold?

43:56.917 --> 43:59.291
Mr. Scott, you're starting
to make me think

43:59.375 --> 44:00.542
I made a grave mistake
in letting a freshman

44:00.625 --> 44:02.250
do such important
research.

44:02.333 --> 44:04.375
Hm! Important research?

44:04.458 --> 44:07.959
All we do
is make smoothies.

44:08.041 --> 44:10.875
I'm literally taking time
away from class and life

44:10.959 --> 44:12.166
to make snacks.

44:12.250 --> 44:13.917
I'm sorry if you think

44:14.000 --> 44:15.458
eventually finding
the cure for diabetes

44:15.542 --> 44:18.166
is a waste
of your time.

44:18.250 --> 44:22.125
You have the honor of working
on a groundbreaking study.

44:23.709 --> 44:25.333
Consumption of
red raspberries

44:25.417 --> 44:28.041
and the maintenance
of normal blood glucose levels.

44:28.125 --> 44:31.375
It's a catchy title, right?
But it's really important.

44:31.458 --> 44:34.709
But I can always find
another student

44:34.792 --> 44:35.542
willing to, uh...

44:35.625 --> 44:39.083
make smoothies,
as you said.

44:40.500 --> 44:44.792
I didn't understand
how important it was.

44:46.625 --> 44:49.083
Please don't give
my position away.

44:49.166 --> 44:51.625
A promising student,
but you need to work

44:51.709 --> 44:52.250
on your time management.

44:52.333 --> 44:54.667
I will.

44:54.750 --> 44:57.250
You won't regret
giving me this opportunity.

44:59.875 --> 45:02.250
Ugh! Stupid.

45:02.333 --> 45:04.709
These are the best
chicken fingers in the world.

45:04.792 --> 45:06.250
Mm-hmm. I love Cane's.

45:06.333 --> 45:08.000
Not only because
of their food,

45:08.083 --> 45:10.208
but because they are
the official sponsors

45:10.291 --> 45:12.125
of Levelz Dance
battle tour.

45:12.208 --> 45:15.333
We're going to be traveling
to four cities,

45:15.417 --> 45:17.834
challenging the best crews
across the U.S.

45:17.917 --> 45:21.333
We're going to San Francisco,
New York,

45:21.417 --> 45:23.125
our hometown, Vegas,

45:23.208 --> 45:25.500
and Baton Rouge,
we're coming for you.

45:25.583 --> 45:27.000
If you manage
to beat us...

45:27.083 --> 45:27.667
If you manage
to beat us...

45:27.750 --> 45:31.750
...you win $50,000 cash.

45:31.834 --> 45:33.291
But that's not going
to happen, though.

45:33.375 --> 45:34.917
Never.

45:35.000 --> 45:37.542
You see?
They're challenging me.

45:37.625 --> 45:40.125
I mean, why else would they come
to Baton Rouge?

45:40.208 --> 45:41.917
Hey, I mean,
Baton Rouge is a great city.

45:42.000 --> 45:45.041
It's got a mixture
of urban and suburban.

45:45.125 --> 45:47.041
Good food. Just...

45:47.125 --> 45:49.166
okay, fine.

45:49.709 --> 45:51.792
We got to win this.

45:51.875 --> 45:55.291
Yeah. But right now
we don't have a crew.

45:59.208 --> 46:01.375
One love, baby.

46:17.917 --> 46:19.500
Okay, guys, so our last
rehearsal was...

46:19.583 --> 46:22.166
-Whack.
-Pathetic.

46:22.250 --> 46:24.458
Poo.

46:24.542 --> 46:26.166
And whose fault was that?

46:26.250 --> 46:28.333
$50,000 is a lot of money.

46:28.417 --> 46:31.417
Yeah, with $50,000 I'm pretty
sure I can forgive

46:31.500 --> 46:32.959
pretty much anyone.

46:33.041 --> 46:34.208
Well, then it's settled.

46:34.291 --> 46:35.792
Let's get to it.

46:37.125 --> 46:38.291
Routine 55.

46:38.375 --> 46:40.917
Five, six, seven, and...

46:45.458 --> 46:46.125
Yes.

47:02.542 --> 47:04.083
I'm not coming back.

47:04.166 --> 47:07.959
The grand prize
is $50,000.

47:09.959 --> 47:12.709
Do I look like
I need the money?

47:14.291 --> 47:17.250
Come on, this is the most fun
you've had in years.

47:17.333 --> 47:18.917
That's an overstatement.

47:19.000 --> 47:22.417
Admit it, you like us.

47:22.500 --> 47:23.291
I like to dance.

47:23.375 --> 47:26.208
And you like us.

47:28.625 --> 47:33.166
You know,
you're amusing.

47:33.250 --> 47:36.083
Just try again.

47:36.166 --> 47:39.750
Come on, you bring
class to the group.

47:41.458 --> 47:43.041
-You mean I'm old.
-No!

47:43.125 --> 47:47.792
No, I mean, it's not like
you're 40.

47:47.875 --> 47:49.625
You just have this
refined quality,

47:49.709 --> 47:52.792
and it just
steps us up a notch,

47:52.875 --> 47:55.709
and you're beautiful.

48:03.709 --> 48:05.792
Please.

48:10.000 --> 48:14.083
♪♪

48:36.333 --> 48:42.208
♪♪

49:09.375 --> 49:11.125
We need her.

49:59.792 --> 50:01.709
You don't need me.

50:01.792 --> 50:05.125
Look, you're really good.

50:05.208 --> 50:07.834
Plus your steps
are great for battles.

50:07.917 --> 50:10.583
Brandon, we finally got
some data.

50:10.667 --> 50:13.250
Okay, I got to fit this in
where I can.

50:13.333 --> 50:15.542
I have to prioritize
my studies.

50:15.625 --> 50:18.208
You sound like my dad.

50:19.500 --> 50:20.709
No, I sound like mine.

50:20.792 --> 50:22.083
Same.

50:22.166 --> 50:23.667
So then why are you not

50:23.750 --> 50:26.417
Listen, Reika,
I love science.

50:26.500 --> 50:28.542
But it doesn't have to be
the only thing I do in my life.

50:28.625 --> 50:31.375
But doesn't it...?

50:33.041 --> 50:36.166
Five, six, seven, and...

50:42.166 --> 50:44.583
All right. Ha!

50:44.667 --> 50:48.125
Hey...

50:48.208 --> 50:50.333
All right, all right.
Nice. That was--

50:50.417 --> 50:52.375
-yeah, that was great.
-It's coming together.

50:52.458 --> 50:54.291
Coming together?
We're fire.

50:54.375 --> 50:56.625
Oh, yeah, we are....
we're fire.

50:58.208 --> 50:59.709
We are getting there.

50:59.792 --> 51:01.750
But we still need
to practice battling.

51:01.834 --> 51:02.625
I mean, I beat Xavier
the other day.

51:02.709 --> 51:06.000
Hey, say that again.

51:06.083 --> 51:07.625
Look, guys, we know
each other's moves.

51:07.709 --> 51:09.041
We know each other's strengths

51:09.125 --> 51:10.667
and we know each other's
weaknesses.

51:10.750 --> 51:12.375
So we go to battle some people
we don't know.

51:14.625 --> 51:15.875
I know some folks.

51:16.875 --> 51:18.458
Uh-oh.

51:18.542 --> 51:19.625
I do.

51:27.542 --> 51:29.250
Our challengers
have arrived.

51:29.333 --> 51:32.125
Whoo!
The Super Fantastic

51:32.208 --> 51:36.458
Dynamic Princess
Superhero President Team.

51:39.917 --> 51:42.166
You can't be serious.

51:42.250 --> 51:45.208
Oh, I'm as serious
as a heart attack.

51:45.291 --> 51:47.250
Okay.

51:47.333 --> 51:49.333
Hey, Margot, ain't you supposed
to be some prima ballerina?

51:49.417 --> 51:51.333
The name is Go-Go.

51:51.417 --> 51:52.542
Drop that beat.

51:52.625 --> 51:54.500
Oh.

51:54.583 --> 51:57.458
She's talking to you.
You heard the lady.

51:57.542 --> 52:01.041
Hey, I'm not the sound guy,
okay?

52:01.125 --> 52:02.667
Then why are you here?

52:02.750 --> 52:05.333
All right, teach these kids
a lesson in manners.

52:05.417 --> 52:07.333
We got this.

52:11.375 --> 52:13.291
-♪ Drop that bass ♪
-♪ That bass ♪

52:13.375 --> 52:15.333

52:27.834 --> 52:29.250
Whoo!

52:30.500 --> 52:31.834
Okay!

52:32.875 --> 52:36.709
Oh!

52:36.792 --> 52:38.834
Let's go.

52:40.917 --> 52:43.667
Oh, get it.

52:46.583 --> 52:48.959
Hey, serve 'em up.

52:54.709 --> 52:56.959
Oh!

53:01.750 --> 53:03.375
Oh!

53:07.917 --> 53:10.208
-Hey, hey, hey!
-Hey, hey, hey!

53:10.291 --> 53:11.917
Yeah, Mommy,
Show them haters.

53:12.000 --> 53:14.208
You're cheering
for the wrong team.

53:14.291 --> 53:15.709
I'm cheering
for my mom.

53:15.792 --> 53:16.458
There's a difference.

53:22.750 --> 53:25.667
Oh! No!

53:28.000 --> 53:30.542
Whoo!

53:30.625 --> 53:31.625
Come on, now.
Show 'em them feet.

53:31.709 --> 53:34.792
Oh!

53:34.875 --> 53:37.500
You got this.
Come on.

53:48.583 --> 53:50.333
Oh!

53:52.375 --> 53:53.750
Hey!

53:56.333 --> 53:58.542
Hey! Hey!

53:58.625 --> 54:01.375
Calm down, okay?
Keep it together.

54:06.041 --> 54:08.709
Wait, wait, wait.

54:11.041 --> 54:12.875
Y'all, we're losing
to kids right now.

54:12.959 --> 54:14.667
Just pull up.

54:27.083 --> 54:28.917
Hey!

54:29.417 --> 54:31.375

Okay!

54:55.959 --> 54:57.875
Show me what you got,
little man.

55:01.125 --> 55:02.834
Yeah, Jacob.
Okay.

55:02.917 --> 55:06.083
Oh!

55:12.625 --> 55:14.834
Is that all you got?
I thought you used to be famous.

55:14.917 --> 55:17.125
Oh.

55:20.083 --> 55:21.750
And I'm still the best.

55:24.709 --> 55:26.375
All Styles.

55:26.458 --> 55:28.250
Honey, remember,
whether or not you win,

55:28.333 --> 55:29.667
you still get pizza, okay?

55:33.583 --> 55:35.375
I'm coming with y'all
to get pizza.

55:35.458 --> 55:38.667
In my book,
you guys totally won.

55:38.750 --> 55:40.000
I think so too.

55:40.083 --> 55:41.709
But it's all right
if we didn't.

55:41.792 --> 55:43.959
Come on.

55:45.083 --> 55:47.458
Grow up.

55:49.083 --> 55:50.542
What?

55:51.750 --> 55:53.458
What?

55:53.542 --> 55:55.083
They're just kids.

55:56.834 --> 55:58.875
Ridiculous.

56:05.709 --> 56:06.792
You wanted to see me?

56:06.875 --> 56:10.959
Nice work on the analysis
on that last batch of data.

56:11.041 --> 56:12.750
Thanks.

56:12.834 --> 56:15.291
I'm curious to see
the final findings, though.

56:15.375 --> 56:17.917
Studying people
with type 2 diabetes

56:18.000 --> 56:20.083
was a pretty good idea.

56:21.834 --> 56:23.792
What are your plans
for the summer?

56:25.125 --> 56:29.500
Um, I had not really
thought that far ahead.

56:30.709 --> 56:31.750
Children.

56:31.834 --> 56:34.166
Hmm?

56:34.250 --> 56:37.083
There's a summer program
at Princeton,

56:37.166 --> 56:39.083
gives undergraduates
hands-on experience

56:39.166 --> 56:41.041
with cancer research.

56:42.500 --> 56:43.792
I read your
admissions essay.

56:43.875 --> 56:45.500
I thought that might
be something

56:45.583 --> 56:48.000
you'd be interested in.

56:48.083 --> 56:50.417
Yeah.

56:50.500 --> 56:52.458
What do I have to do?

56:52.542 --> 56:54.500
It's an extensive
application process.

56:54.583 --> 56:57.166
It includes an in-person
interview here on campus,

56:57.250 --> 57:00.208
and an oral presentation.

57:00.291 --> 57:02.834
Sounds like an amazing
opportunity.

57:04.166 --> 57:05.667
I know.

57:06.917 --> 57:08.917
It is.
So get your act together

57:09.000 --> 57:11.709
and we'll go over your
presentation in a couple weeks.

57:11.792 --> 57:16.291
Yeah! Yes. Thank you,
Mr. Schmidt.

57:20.000 --> 57:21.667
Without the assistance
of medication,

57:21.750 --> 57:23.959
patients reacted to raspberries
with insulin levels

57:24.041 --> 57:26.000
decreasing at a rapid rate.

57:26.083 --> 57:28.875
You need to be
more specific.

57:28.959 --> 57:30.083
Yeah, rapid rate
isn't clear enough.

57:30.166 --> 57:32.000
Why aren't you discussing

57:32.083 --> 57:34.458
Professor Schmidt's research
for your presentation?

57:34.542 --> 57:35.959
I just want to do
something different.

57:36.041 --> 57:37.667
So you like
to make your life hard.

57:37.750 --> 57:38.834
Basically.

57:38.917 --> 57:41.834
Well, I can help with
your presentation if you want.

57:41.917 --> 57:43.792
No, I'm good.

57:43.875 --> 57:47.375
Has Nate been
to all those places?

57:49.000 --> 57:50.166
Yeah, I guess so.

57:50.250 --> 57:52.375
Wow, that's amazing.

57:52.458 --> 57:53.375
I mean, I've only been
to India.

57:53.458 --> 57:56.208
I've been to Kansas.

57:56.291 --> 57:58.709
Hey, if you could go anywhere in
the world, where would you go?

57:58.792 --> 58:00.667
Iceland,
specifically Kópavogur.

58:00.750 --> 58:03.959
You've clearly given this
a lot of thought.

58:04.041 --> 58:06.208
Well, you got to map out
your dreams.

58:06.291 --> 58:08.000
Well, you know,
you could go to Iceland

58:08.083 --> 58:09.834
if you joined
All Styles again.

58:09.917 --> 58:11.041
Why

58:11.125 --> 58:14.875
I mean, we're going to win
this competition for $50,000.

58:14.959 --> 58:16.709
$50,000?

58:16.792 --> 58:21.166
Flights to Kópavogur right now
are around $2,175.

58:21.250 --> 58:25.333
Okay, so you're in.

58:30.834 --> 58:32.667
So that was a really
good rehearsal.

58:32.750 --> 58:33.917
You did better.

58:34.000 --> 58:35.625
-Come on, let's go.

58:35.709 --> 58:36.959
I'll see you later.

58:38.333 --> 58:41.250
What are you doing?

58:41.333 --> 58:42.750
Rehearsing.

58:42.834 --> 58:44.000
Rehearsing for...?

58:44.083 --> 58:45.208
The battle.

58:45.291 --> 58:46.834
I don't dance like you.

58:46.917 --> 58:47.458
I can't just get up there
and battle.

58:47.542 --> 58:49.750
Hmm, so you're nervous?

58:49.834 --> 58:51.250
Maybe.

58:51.333 --> 58:53.667
You know what?
I'm going to play a song.

58:53.750 --> 58:56.542
You just have fun,
and I'll sit and watch.

Dad, don't turn

We're still working.

01:02:17.250 --> 01:02:19.000
I can never remember
the code.

01:02:19.083 --> 01:02:21.333
Oh, so you're not good
with everything, huh?

01:02:21.417 --> 01:02:22.959
-Hardly.
Lark.

01:02:25.417 --> 01:02:28.500
You almost wrapped up?
Mom's expecting us.

01:02:30.166 --> 01:02:31.875
Hi, Mr. Yohannes.

01:02:31.959 --> 01:02:34.458
I am Brandon,
and this is Lark.

01:02:34.542 --> 01:02:37.375
I am Lark's friend.
I'm Brandon.

01:02:37.458 --> 01:02:39.000
Lark's friend.

01:02:39.083 --> 01:02:41.291
Mr. Yonas is my father.

01:02:41.375 --> 01:02:43.166
Call me Dr. Yohannes.

01:02:43.250 --> 01:02:44.125
I'm sorry, Dr. Yohannes.

01:02:44.208 --> 01:02:46.333
Gotcha.

01:02:48.250 --> 01:02:49.792
Nice to meet you, Brandon.
Call me Yonas.

01:02:49.875 --> 01:02:51.417
Nice to finally meet
the young man

01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:52.083
who's taking up so much
of my daughter's time.

01:02:52.166 --> 01:02:53.333
Dad!

01:02:53.417 --> 01:02:55.500
I'm just joking.

01:02:55.583 --> 01:02:57.000
Mr. Brandon,

01:02:57.083 --> 01:02:59.834
I'm looking forward
to learning more about you...

01:02:59.917 --> 01:03:01.041
at dinner.

01:03:01.125 --> 01:03:03.500
Larky, let's head out.

01:03:04.834 --> 01:03:06.834
Guess you're coming over
for dinner.

01:03:10.959 --> 01:03:12.000
I'm trying to help you.

01:03:12.083 --> 01:03:14.542
You know, we had picked
this costume out for her,

01:03:14.625 --> 01:03:16.917
and she's like, "No, I want
to go in my birthday suit."

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.291
She was so cute.

01:03:18.375 --> 01:03:20.166
We turned around,
and she had gone outside,

01:03:20.250 --> 01:03:21.375
butt-naked.

01:03:21.458 --> 01:03:23.875
-Oh, my gosh.

01:03:23.959 --> 01:03:25.417
Can I take your plate
after that story?

01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:27.166
-Thank you, Mama.
-You're welcome.

01:03:27.250 --> 01:03:28.291
Thank you.

01:03:28.375 --> 01:03:31.000
You're welcome.
I'll get the tea.

01:03:31.083 --> 01:03:33.959
I haven't had a home-cooked
meal like that in ages.

01:03:35.458 --> 01:03:37.041
Lark says
you're quite the dancer.

01:03:37.125 --> 01:03:38.792
Yeah.

01:03:38.875 --> 01:03:40.375
Thanks, but not like Lark.

01:03:40.458 --> 01:03:42.709
She's amazing.

01:03:42.792 --> 01:03:45.375
Look at you,
throwing out compliments.

01:03:45.458 --> 01:03:48.208
I mean it's not too often
you grown up

01:03:48.291 --> 01:03:49.792
with a family of dancers.

01:03:49.875 --> 01:03:50.542
Family of doctors.
I'm the black sheep

01:03:50.625 --> 01:03:53.125
for not majoring
in medicine.

01:03:53.208 --> 01:03:55.959
Now, Larky, I keep telling you,
you can do both.

01:03:56.041 --> 01:03:57.917
Look at me.
Look at your father.

01:03:58.041 --> 01:04:00.208
-Here we go again.
-Oh.

01:04:00.291 --> 01:04:01.458
Mom loves to tell
the story

01:04:01.542 --> 01:04:04.166
about how she was dancing at
Ailey and she pulled a tendon.

01:04:04.250 --> 01:04:05.583
That injury made her decide
she wanted to become a surgeon,

01:04:05.667 --> 01:04:08.291
and blah, blah, blah.

01:04:08.375 --> 01:04:11.417
Now, Brandon, I tell the story
with much more flair.

01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:12.041
And it lasts for hours.

01:04:12.125 --> 01:04:14.083
-Ooh.

01:04:14.166 --> 01:04:14.917
Stop teasing.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.333
So are you
a dance major also?

01:04:17.417 --> 01:04:19.208
No, biochemistry.

01:04:19.291 --> 01:04:21.250
Oh, a man after my own heart.

01:04:21.333 --> 01:04:23.583
A scientist with rhythm.

01:04:25.250 --> 01:04:27.250
-Lark, he's a keeper.
-Dad!

01:04:27.333 --> 01:04:29.417
Now, biochemists
that can dance,

01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:30.500
you don't find that often.

01:04:30.583 --> 01:04:32.417
You really don't.

01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:34.709
-But my mom was a dancer too.

01:04:34.792 --> 01:04:36.375
I didn't know your mom
was a dancer.

01:04:36.458 --> 01:04:38.166
Mm-hmm.

01:04:38.250 --> 01:04:40.375
She performed all around
the world when I was little.

01:04:40.458 --> 01:04:42.208
She was perfectly healthy.

01:04:42.291 --> 01:04:45.458
And then, boom, cancer.

01:04:45.542 --> 01:04:47.959
I'm so sorry.

01:04:48.041 --> 01:04:50.125
It was crazy.

01:04:50.208 --> 01:04:52.041
It made me want to become
a researcher, though.

01:04:52.125 --> 01:04:53.208
So I could work
to find a cure.

01:04:53.291 --> 01:04:55.959
It sounds to me like
you're doing a great job

01:04:56.041 --> 01:04:57.959
keeping your mother's
legacy alive.

01:04:58.041 --> 01:04:59.291
Thank you.

01:04:59.375 --> 01:05:00.875
I'd like to keep dancing
in the future.

01:05:00.959 --> 01:05:04.792
But right now,
science is the goal.

01:05:04.875 --> 01:05:06.291
Dancing makes me
a better surgeon,

01:05:06.375 --> 01:05:07.750
if you could believe that.

01:05:07.834 --> 01:05:09.917
It provides moments
of pure freedom

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:11.333
in which your body takes over

01:05:11.417 --> 01:05:14.125
and moves to its own
natural beat.

01:05:14.208 --> 01:05:16.458
When I'm dancing, I don't have
a care in the world.

01:05:16.542 --> 01:05:19.542
Me neither.

01:05:51.834 --> 01:05:53.542
You must be
so sick of this.

01:05:53.625 --> 01:05:56.000
You have no idea.

01:05:56.083 --> 01:05:58.417
Well, I added some extra
honey to this batch.

01:05:58.500 --> 01:06:00.250
Thank you.

01:06:02.250 --> 01:06:04.417
Hey, what time is
your presentation?

01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:05.500
5:00 p.m.
What time is yours?

01:06:05.583 --> 01:06:06.750
It's right before.

01:06:06.834 --> 01:06:09.375
That's cutting it
really close.

01:06:09.458 --> 01:06:10.709
We'll still make it.

01:06:10.792 --> 01:06:12.625
I mean, the competition's
at 7:00.

01:06:12.709 --> 01:06:15.041
We're barely going to have
any time to stretch or anything.

01:06:15.125 --> 01:06:17.333
We'll put our clothes in a bag
and change in the bathroom.

01:06:17.417 --> 01:06:18.417
What if there's traffic?

01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:20.208
We can do it.

East Coast Hall.

01:08:39.250 --> 01:08:39.834
-Oh.
-Yeah.

01:08:39.917 --> 01:08:42.417
It's like a research center.

01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:44.291
Yeah, something
like that.

01:08:44.375 --> 01:08:47.582
Dad, what are you doing?
Come on.

01:08:47.667 --> 01:08:49.667
Your old man
didn't go to college.

01:08:49.750 --> 01:08:51.166
I'm just taking it
all in.

01:08:51.250 --> 01:08:54.375
I understand,
but don't want to be late.

01:08:54.457 --> 01:08:56.375
Don't want to be late.

01:09:03.834 --> 01:09:05.457
You guys want
something else?

01:09:05.542 --> 01:09:05.959
No, I'm good.

01:09:06.041 --> 01:09:08.792
Oh, amazing, sir.

01:09:08.875 --> 01:09:10.582
I don't know about all that.
You didn't even taste it.

01:09:15.625 --> 01:09:17.166
Brandon's got to keep
his strength up.

01:09:17.250 --> 01:09:18.875
Yeah, for the presentation.

01:09:18.959 --> 01:09:21.709
Yeah, that and he's got...

01:09:21.792 --> 01:09:24.332
He's what?

01:09:24.417 --> 01:09:25.750
What's going on?

01:09:25.834 --> 01:09:26.667
It's just...

01:09:26.750 --> 01:09:29.375
it's just that...

01:09:29.457 --> 01:09:32.457
I can't...
I can't imagine some of the...

01:09:32.542 --> 01:09:34.625
mental energy
it must require

01:09:34.709 --> 01:09:36.375
for the gymnastics that...

01:09:36.457 --> 01:09:38.917
mental gymnastics that Brandon
has to go through.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:43.750
I myself have only taken
a few humanities classes,

01:09:43.834 --> 01:09:45.667
and even then I can barely...

01:09:45.750 --> 01:09:47.582
I'm in a dance crew, Dad.

01:09:47.667 --> 01:09:50.291
It's called All Styles,

01:09:50.375 --> 01:09:52.625
and Nate is our...

01:09:52.709 --> 01:09:54.082
Manager.

01:09:54.166 --> 01:09:56.709
We're competing
after my presentation.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:01.417
I thought you were done
with all this.

01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:02.750
What's the difference?

01:10:02.834 --> 01:10:04.667
The difference is
you lied to me.

01:10:04.750 --> 01:10:06.583
I didn't lie to you.
I just didn't tell you.

01:10:06.667 --> 01:10:08.333
Brandon, don't give me
your lip.

01:10:08.417 --> 01:10:10.166
You know, we'll just
talk about this later.

01:10:10.250 --> 01:10:13.291
There's really nothing
to talk about, Dad.

01:10:13.375 --> 01:10:14.792
You can't stop me
from doing this.

01:10:14.875 --> 01:10:16.500
Oh, I can't?

01:10:19.083 --> 01:10:21.792
-You're just like your--

01:10:21.875 --> 01:10:25.750
The time she spent away from us
dancing, we will never get back.

01:10:25.834 --> 01:10:28.125
You mean the time she spent
chasing her dreams.

01:10:29.542 --> 01:10:30.792
I'm, uh...

01:10:30.875 --> 01:10:32.417
I'm...

01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:34.125
yeah, I'm going to go
get the check.

Through the study of these
very complex reactions,

01:13:38.542 --> 01:13:40.875
we find that these chemicals
processes,

01:13:40.959 --> 01:13:43.000
ranging from unassisted
to prescription,

01:13:43.083 --> 01:13:46.000
must be in balance
to maintain proper health.

01:13:46.083 --> 01:13:47.583
Thank you.

01:13:51.875 --> 01:13:54.000
Next up, we have
Brandon Scott.

01:13:58.959 --> 01:14:00.875
Thank you guys so much
for this opportunity.

01:14:00.959 --> 01:14:04.834
I'm going to be presenting
on some groundbreaking research

01:14:04.917 --> 01:14:09.500
of the effects of the usage
of Herceptin on HER2.

01:14:09.583 --> 01:14:12.875
Welcome to Baton Rouge,
Louisiana,

01:14:12.959 --> 01:14:15.458
the last stop on the Levelz
and Raising Cane's

01:14:15.542 --> 01:14:17.041
dance battle tour.

01:14:17.125 --> 01:14:19.333
Over the last month,
Levelz have challenged crews

01:14:19.417 --> 01:14:22.000
in cities across
the country,

01:14:22.083 --> 01:14:25.875
including New York,
San Francisco and Las Vegas.

01:14:25.959 --> 01:14:29.208
So far, no one
can stop them.

01:14:29.291 --> 01:14:30.291
In both tissues,
the glucose enters

01:14:30.375 --> 01:14:32.834
by facilitated diffusion.

01:14:32.917 --> 01:14:35.500
A key difference is that
only the liver tissue

01:14:35.583 --> 01:14:37.792
is available to
synthesize glucose.

01:14:38.959 --> 01:14:40.125
The final stop on the tour

01:14:40.208 --> 01:14:42.000
brings us to Baton Rouge.

01:14:42.083 --> 01:14:44.875
Let's see if any local talent
can beat Levelz

01:14:44.959 --> 01:14:48.291
for $50,000.

01:14:49.667 --> 01:14:51.208
Oh, where are those guys?

01:14:53.125 --> 01:14:55.041
Thank you guys so much
for this opportunity

01:14:56.834 --> 01:14:58.750
♪ Here we go again ♪

01:14:58.834 --> 01:15:00.667
♪ Hot damn, here we go again ♪

01:15:00.750 --> 01:15:02.709

01:15:02.792 --> 01:15:06.333
Here we go. Give it up
for Hot Steppers.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:17.208
Up next, we got Status.

01:15:17.291 --> 01:15:18.959
Yup. Oh, hey.

01:15:19.041 --> 01:15:21.333
Get it, get it,
get it, get it.

01:15:21.417 --> 01:15:23.583
Let's go, come on.
Let's go, come on.

01:15:23.667 --> 01:15:25.834
Hey, hey, hey, yeah.

01:15:35.875 --> 01:15:38.166
Hey.

01:15:38.250 --> 01:15:40.083
What's up?

01:15:40.166 --> 01:15:41.792
A lot of things.

01:15:41.875 --> 01:15:42.750
I see.

01:15:44.667 --> 01:15:45.875
-Yeah.

01:15:45.959 --> 01:15:49.792
You found a group of people
to finally let you shine.

01:15:49.875 --> 01:15:52.417
-It's not like that.
-Sure it's not.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:57.083
You know what, Sabby?
I'm happy for you.

01:15:57.166 --> 01:15:59.792
No one deserves success
more than you.

01:15:59.875 --> 01:16:01.291
Are you trying
to psych me out?

01:16:01.375 --> 01:16:02.875
No, I'm serious.

01:16:02.959 --> 01:16:05.792
I hope one day
we can be friends again.

01:16:22.792 --> 01:16:25.000
Oh, good.
You're finally dressed.

01:16:25.083 --> 01:16:27.083
Huddle up, guys.

01:16:29.208 --> 01:16:31.667
I don't know, you guys, the
other crews look really good.

01:16:31.750 --> 01:16:35.792
Guys, don't be nervous.
We got this.

01:16:35.875 --> 01:16:37.166
Dunk's right.

01:16:37.250 --> 01:16:38.709
We've come a long way.

01:16:38.792 --> 01:16:39.417
And I'm so proud
of you guys.

01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:43.208
This is our big moment.

01:16:43.291 --> 01:16:44.750
And I know
you can do this.

01:16:44.834 --> 01:16:46.792
Just remember, the things
that make us special

01:16:46.875 --> 01:16:49.000
are the things
that set us apart.

01:16:49.083 --> 01:16:51.041
-Right.

01:16:51.125 --> 01:16:52.667
All Styles on three.

01:16:52.750 --> 01:16:54.667
One, two, three.

01:16:54.750 --> 01:16:57.291
All Styles! Whoo!

01:16:59.917 --> 01:17:01.041
What have we got here?

01:17:01.125 --> 01:17:06.750
Is this the brand-new barely
lewd face crew All Styles?

01:17:13.542 --> 01:17:16.542
Hot sauce, y'all,
They burning it up.

01:17:21.709 --> 01:17:23.917
Hey, hey, hey.

01:17:27.917 --> 01:17:30.000
Didn't see that one coming.

01:17:31.542 --> 01:17:34.458
Don't beat yourself, y'all.
Treat yourself.

01:17:37.166 --> 01:17:38.709
Uh-huh..

01:17:38.792 --> 01:17:42.125
That was good, y'all.

01:17:42.208 --> 01:17:43.709
You're killing it, Mom.

01:17:43.792 --> 01:17:45.083
Thank you, honey.

01:17:45.166 --> 01:17:47.375
Oh! Oh, you guys,
come meet my husband.

01:17:47.458 --> 01:17:49.291
Mwah.

01:17:49.375 --> 01:17:51.041
-Hey. Brad. Good to meet you.
-Hey, nice to meet you.

01:17:51.125 --> 01:17:53.041
Hi, Brad. Hey, how are you?
Great stuff.

01:17:53.125 --> 01:17:55.083
Hi, yeah, I'm Nate.

01:17:55.166 --> 01:17:57.417
Oh, yeah, I've heard a lot
about you, young man.

01:17:57.500 --> 01:18:00.166
Oh, have you?
All good things, I hope.

01:18:00.250 --> 01:18:02.750
I got my eye on you.

01:18:02.834 --> 01:18:05.083
I've got my eye on...

01:18:05.166 --> 01:18:06.750
me.

01:18:06.834 --> 01:18:09.250
Okay, you two.
-Good luck.

01:18:09.333 --> 01:18:11.083
Mwah. Love you.

01:18:13.166 --> 01:18:15.083
Oh, don't mind him.
He's just such a jokester.

01:18:15.166 --> 01:18:16.333
Yeah, I know,
I know.

01:18:16.417 --> 01:18:17.750
He seemed
really intelligent.

01:18:17.834 --> 01:18:19.542
I mean, his getup
is just proof of that.

01:18:19.625 --> 01:18:22.041
I mean, he has great taste
in corduroy.

01:18:22.125 --> 01:18:23.500
It's really nice.

01:18:23.583 --> 01:18:26.583
And the guy smells like
peppermint cinnamon.

01:18:26.667 --> 01:18:27.166
-Yeah, okay.

01:18:31.375 --> 01:18:33.000
Yo, first off,
I want to say

01:18:33.083 --> 01:18:35.959
that each and every one of y'all
did an amazing job today.

01:18:38.667 --> 01:18:40.917
We want to thank
our sponsor

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:42.792
for today's competition,
Raising Cane's.

01:18:42.875 --> 01:18:44.250
Give it up for Raising Cane's
y'all!

01:18:47.917 --> 01:18:50.792
And the team chosen
to battle Levelz

01:18:50.875 --> 01:18:53.917
for $50,000 is...

01:18:56.208 --> 01:18:56.542
All Styles!

01:19:04.667 --> 01:19:08.500
This is it, y'all.
And so it begins.

01:19:08.583 --> 01:19:13.083
We gonna start this battle off
with Levelz.

01:19:17.250 --> 01:19:18.333
Hey.

01:19:18.417 --> 01:19:20.583
Okay.

01:19:25.417 --> 01:19:26.542
