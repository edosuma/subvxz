00:03.517 --> 00:04.827
Miss Sullivan,
you are in contempt.

00:05.068 --> 00:07.482
She's disrespectful,
undisciplined.

00:07.620 --> 00:09.724
- Holy shit.
- Let's see, there, right there.

00:09.862 --> 00:11.517
Remember,
it's all about your client.

00:11.655 --> 00:13.586
- He may look like a creep--
- He is a creep.

00:13.724 --> 00:15.758
You need to drop the revulsion.
Touch on the shoulder,

00:15.896 --> 00:18.034
something to telegraph
that you're not afraid.

00:18.275 --> 00:20.310
Harder.

00:20.689 --> 00:22.689
Never in my wildest dreams
would I imagine

00:22.827 --> 00:25.344
that I'd feel good
about getting a rubber off.

00:25.482 --> 00:26.551
Drinks on me.

00:26.689 --> 00:28.068
Except you never
carry your wallet.

00:28.206 --> 00:29.482
- I'm going to get my wallet.
- Thank you.

00:30.310 --> 00:32.275
Step away from the vehicle.
Hands in the air, now!

00:32.413 --> 00:34.241
I didn't do nothing, man,
I didn't do anything!

00:34.379 --> 00:36.172
Get off of me! Ah!

00:47.862 --> 00:52.275
Oh my God! DateMatcher is like
the Wild West for black women.

00:52.413 --> 00:53.931
You have no idea,
like this guy.

00:54.068 --> 00:56.620
He said he was looking
for his own personal Tar Baby.

00:56.758 --> 00:59.241
- Ugh!
- That is so wrong, oh my God.

00:59.379 --> 01:01.172
He likes women
nice and black.

01:06.689 --> 01:08.517
Where's my damn phone call?

01:08.758 --> 01:11.413
Press down.
Get it nice and black.

01:11.551 --> 01:13.758
- Oh, he's kind of cute.
- He has a good body too,

01:13.896 --> 01:15.724
and he says he's working
on getting his black belt.

01:15.862 --> 01:17.448
You don't know
what that means do you?

01:17.896 --> 01:21.068
A black belt is when a white guy
finally bangs a black chick.

01:21.206 --> 01:22.310
No!

01:22.827 --> 01:24.517
Bend your knees
and open up for Jesus.

01:24.655 --> 01:26.931
You can't do a strip search!
I'm a lawyer.

01:27.172 --> 01:30.793
Yeah? Well, you mouthed off.
So you're my bitch now.

01:34.931 --> 01:37.724
Okay, listen to this.
The darker the berry. Right?

01:38.172 --> 01:43.206
Talented with their lips.
Kinky hair, kinky sex.

01:43.344 --> 01:45.137
And this one is
my personal favorite.

01:45.275 --> 01:47.103
I want to make you
my Nubian bitch.

01:47.241 --> 01:51.551
Oh, I apologize on behalf
white people, oh my God!

01:51.689 --> 01:53.379
You guys, I'm really worried
about Charlie, though.

01:53.517 --> 01:55.551
I mean I know he never liked
to pay, but just ghosting us?

01:55.689 --> 01:57.896
Oh please, he probably ran
into Sheila from Accounting.

01:58.034 --> 02:00.000
He's buttering his biscuit
as we speak.

02:00.206 --> 02:02.482
My cell, my rules.

02:02.620 --> 02:05.655
No pissing on the floor,
no fighting, no complaining.

02:05.793 --> 02:09.172
I don't know when you're going
to see judge and I don't care.

02:10.551 --> 02:12.482
Make some room.

02:33.413 --> 02:37.206
Two months in jail
for whooping my own child?

02:37.620 --> 02:39.931
The DA's office
considers it child abuse.

02:40.068 --> 02:43.000
But he stole my car
and crashed it.

02:43.137 --> 02:44.448
He's nine years old.

02:44.586 --> 02:46.655
He could have killed
somebody or got killed.

02:46.793 --> 02:48.310
The problem is the video.

02:48.448 --> 02:50.448
It doesn't look good
and it went viral.

02:51.551 --> 02:53.344
Alright, what about Jason?

02:53.655 --> 02:56.517
Child services already took him
and gave him to my sister-in-law

02:56.655 --> 02:59.172
because my husband
is stationed overseas.

02:59.310 --> 03:00.689
She and I, we don't get along,

03:00.827 --> 03:02.931
so she's been arguing
against me seeing him.

03:03.068 --> 03:04.586
So, if I took the plea,

03:04.724 --> 03:06.896
would I get my son back
when I got out?

03:07.068 --> 03:09.586
The prosecutor doesn't have
any control over that.

03:09.724 --> 03:12.655
It's possible you could lose
custody of Jason for at least

03:12.793 --> 03:15.034
two years, if your husband
can't come home, maybe three.

03:18.379 --> 03:20.862
Okay, look.
You do have a defense.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.482
- It's called justification.
- Gwen.

03:22.620 --> 03:24.241
The law allows parents
to use force

03:24.379 --> 03:26.275
to discipline their children
or safeguard their welfare.

03:26.413 --> 03:29.344
- Yes, that's what I was doing.
- Except the force you use

03:29.482 --> 03:32.034
has to be reasonable
and you broke Jason's arm.

03:32.172 --> 03:33.586
I didn't break his arm!

03:33.724 --> 03:35.103
He fell while he was trying
to get away from me.

03:35.241 --> 03:37.655
Miss Lyons,
you used a doubled up belt.

03:37.793 --> 03:41.862
I was trying to help my son.
Do you know, last year,

03:42.000 --> 03:45.758
Jason's best friend Frankie,
he was playing tee-ball.

03:45.896 --> 03:48.551
Come to find out, some of
the so-called volunteers,

03:48.689 --> 03:51.931
they were still gang banging
and we didn't know this,

03:52.068 --> 03:54.482
but Frankie,
he was being groomed

03:54.620 --> 03:58.689
and he was killed a week
before his ninth birthday.

03:58.862 --> 04:00.827
I'm just worried
about taking this to a jury.

04:00.965 --> 04:04.068
You know, family services
already took my son

04:04.206 --> 04:06.413
like I'm some kind of criminal.

04:08.448 --> 04:13.965
I am not pleading guilty.
I didn't do nothing wrong.

04:16.310 --> 04:17.586
What was that?

04:17.724 --> 04:19.034
I asked you to help me
convince her to plea.

04:19.172 --> 04:20.620
You pretty much talked
her out of it.

04:20.758 --> 04:22.448
It didn't seem like pleading
was the best move.

04:22.586 --> 04:24.379
I pulled Blackburn as a judge
and I'm up against Milltown.

04:24.517 --> 04:26.344
She's playing that
"I'm cool and liberal" act

04:26.482 --> 04:28.862
and meanwhile,
she goes hard on child cases.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.827
Girl, you got this.

04:31.689 --> 04:33.724
You know, you need a black jury.
Black people don't trip

04:33.862 --> 04:35.551
about corporal punishment
like white folks.

04:35.689 --> 04:38.068
We get an Upper East Side, take
a time out Mommy and Me panel,

04:38.206 --> 04:40.310
and we are dead
before we even start.

04:40.448 --> 04:42.068
Mmm.

04:42.206 --> 04:44.310
Still want me
to second chair?

04:44.448 --> 04:47.000
Let's just sing
from the same hymnal.

04:47.241 --> 04:48.344
Where is Bennett?

04:48.482 --> 04:49.965
Shadowing prosecutors
this week.

04:50.103 --> 04:52.103
Ah! Traitor, screw him.
Moving on.

04:52.241 --> 04:54.620
Hey, listen up!
Everyone listen up!

04:54.758 --> 04:57.586
I need everyone in AR2 now.

04:59.758 --> 05:02.586
Docket ending 875,
The People versus...

05:02.724 --> 05:05.896
Charles Riggs. Step up.

05:10.034 --> 05:11.344
What the hell happened?

05:11.758 --> 05:16.310
Judge, Mr. Riggs was admiring
a classic car last night,

05:16.862 --> 05:20.172
when he was mistaken
for a carjacking suspect

05:20.310 --> 05:23.000
- and arrested.
- Is that right?

05:23.586 --> 05:25.620
And what dumbass did that?

05:27.551 --> 05:30.448
Your honor, the DA's office
moves to dismiss.

05:30.620 --> 05:32.137
I should hope so.

05:32.758 --> 05:36.172
Case dismissed, Mr. Riggs,
with apologies from the court.

05:40.793 --> 05:43.275
I want you to take
a few days off. Alright?

05:43.413 --> 05:44.965
Regroup.

05:58.586 --> 06:01.620
Juror number 3, how do you
feel about corporal punishment?

06:01.793 --> 06:04.620
I don't think it's necessary.
I use time outs.

06:04.758 --> 06:06.931
Juror number 21,
were you spanked as a child?

06:07.068 --> 06:09.379
Yeah. Kept me in line.

06:10.137 --> 06:12.068
Juror number 3,
did you spank your children?

06:12.206 --> 06:14.793
I was spanked, but no,
I don't spank mine.

06:15.241 --> 06:18.103
Juror number 52, you said
you were not spanked as a child.

06:18.241 --> 06:19.827
Would you spank
your own children?

06:19.965 --> 06:21.620
Yes, I would.

06:25.551 --> 06:28.689
The People challenge
number 52 and number 21.

06:29.724 --> 06:31.827
Defense challenges number 3.

06:32.620 --> 06:35.862
Juror number 36.
Have you seen the video

06:36.000 --> 06:37.862
of the defendant
flogging her child?

06:38.000 --> 06:41.310
- Your Honor, flogging, really?
- Overruled.

06:42.068 --> 06:46.068
Yes, I've seen the video.
It's horrifying. Use your words.

06:47.103 --> 06:48.896
Juror number 4,
did you spank your kids?

06:49.034 --> 06:50.517
No, I did not.

06:51.620 --> 06:53.310
I can't see putting
someone in jail

06:53.448 --> 06:55.896
- for disciplining their kid.
- Thank you, juror number 10.

06:56.034 --> 06:59.241
The defense moves
to excuse juror number 36.

07:00.827 --> 07:03.793
Juror number 36,
if I instructed you

07:03.931 --> 07:07.068
to be fair and to consider
all of the evidence,

07:07.206 --> 07:09.551
- could you do that?
- Of course.

07:10.103 --> 07:11.793
I will not excuse her for cause.

07:11.931 --> 07:15.172
The People move to excuse
juror number 10 for cause.

07:15.551 --> 07:20.689
Granted. Juror number 10
is thanked and excused.

07:22.413 --> 07:25.310
- Blackburn's screwing us.
- Yeah.

07:26.241 --> 07:27.517
Ladies and gentlemen,

07:27.655 --> 07:30.172
you are the empanelled jury
on this case.

07:30.310 --> 07:34.655
- Is this a bad jury?
- To be honest, I don't know.

07:46.724 --> 07:49.000
- Okay, I got it.
- What, diabetes?

07:49.379 --> 07:52.758
Blackburn. I found some
forum posts that she's written.

07:53.586 --> 07:57.275
You think we could recuse her?
How do we know this is her?

07:57.413 --> 07:59.448
Who else would use the name,
JudgeyMommy?

07:59.586 --> 08:02.620
Those posts are really
anti-corporal punishment.

08:02.862 --> 08:05.482
Oh, damn,
look who funds the site?

08:05.655 --> 08:07.620
Plentiful Hope
Children's Foundation,

08:07.758 --> 08:09.793
- her donation jar.
- Mm-hmm.

08:09.931 --> 08:12.965
No, she'll never recuse herself

08:13.103 --> 08:14.655
and then all we've done
is piss her off.

08:14.793 --> 08:16.448
JudgeyMommy is already
pissed off. That's the problem.

08:16.586 --> 08:17.827
Yeah, but at least
it's Blackburn,

08:17.965 --> 08:19.379
her bias is obvious
on the record.

08:19.517 --> 08:21.137
We recuse her, we could get
some stealth judge

08:21.275 --> 08:23.551
who protects herself and then
we got nothing on appeal.

08:23.689 --> 08:25.000
Recuse who?

08:26.275 --> 08:29.482
Well, Tom, it is nice to know
that you are not circumcised.

08:31.275 --> 08:34.344
Blackburn, she's got a lot of
anti-corporal punishment posts.

08:34.482 --> 08:37.034
And negative, she holds grudges.
It'll have a domino effect.

08:37.172 --> 08:38.586
She'll have it in
for everyone from our office.

08:38.724 --> 08:41.551
- But, Tom--
- Absolutely, no recusal.

08:42.206 --> 08:43.551
Damn.

08:43.689 --> 08:45.758
It's fine, I didn't think
it was a good idea anyway.

09:45.827 --> 09:47.344
I've been in here for two days

09:47.482 --> 09:49.068
and if I'm here any longer,
my job's going to fire me.

09:49.206 --> 09:51.068
It's just a summons,
you'll be out of here shortly.

09:51.206 --> 09:54.103
Docket ending 934,
The People versus Fabian Reyes.

09:54.241 --> 09:56.379
- Step up.
- Okay.

09:57.103 --> 09:59.620
- What do we got?
- Return on a warrant, Judge.

09:59.758 --> 10:01.620
Desk appearance ticket,
unlicensed dog,

10:01.758 --> 10:03.034
no vaccination certificate.

10:03.172 --> 10:04.862
The defendant never
showed up for court.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.068
The People offer
three days' community service.

10:07.206 --> 10:09.000
Your Honor, he's already
been in here almost two days.

10:09.137 --> 10:10.758
Well, when you don't come back
the first time,

10:10.896 --> 10:12.517
you get the slow justice.

10:12.827 --> 10:14.620
His friend said that he would
take care of the ticket.

10:14.758 --> 10:16.758
Don't waste my time
with sob stories, counselor.

10:16.896 --> 10:19.000
Just tell me he doesn't want
to take the plea.

10:19.137 --> 10:20.103
Bail set at 500.

10:20.241 --> 10:22.068
I don't have that kind of money.

10:22.310 --> 10:24.241
Your Honor,
the dog wasn't even his.

10:24.379 --> 10:25.827
He was walking it for a friend.

10:25.965 --> 10:28.655
Post bail or plead guilty.
I got cases to move here.

10:28.793 --> 10:31.000
Why should I plead guilty
to something I didn't even do?

10:31.172 --> 10:34.068
Sounds like you're going
to post bail. Next case.

10:34.206 --> 10:36.068
No wait, I'll lose my job!

10:40.172 --> 10:42.689
All children should be
removed from the courtroom.

10:42.827 --> 10:45.517
If you have an upcoming case,
please come back after--

10:45.655 --> 10:47.241
No, no, no, Jim, it's okay.

10:47.379 --> 10:48.517
Truth be told,
sometimes it's nice

10:48.655 --> 10:50.034
to have some kids
in the courtroom.

10:50.172 --> 10:51.689
Forget what Tom said,
we've got to recuse her.

10:51.827 --> 10:53.137
Wait, Gwen, no, wait!

10:53.275 --> 10:54.862
Your Honor,
before you bring in the jury,

10:55.000 --> 10:57.517
the defense respectfully moves
that you recuse yourself.

10:57.655 --> 10:59.068
On what grounds?

10:59.206 --> 11:00.862
You've made some remarks
regarding corporal punishment

11:01.000 --> 11:03.931
that gives the defense
cause to believe you're biased.

11:04.620 --> 11:06.517
"Spanking as
a disciplinary tactic

11:06.655 --> 11:08.931
is barbaric
and completely ineffective.

11:09.068 --> 11:11.379
Any individual who engages
in corporal punishment

11:11.517 --> 11:13.137
should be prosecuted
to the full extent

11:13.275 --> 11:14.655
of the law where appropriate."

11:14.793 --> 11:16.793
I'm not recusing myself
because you stumbled

11:16.931 --> 11:19.241
onto some posts
you suspect I wrote.

11:19.379 --> 11:21.655
We're prepared
to subpoena the ISP.

11:21.793 --> 11:24.000
Alright, approach.

11:25.827 --> 11:27.482
This is off the record.

11:32.448 --> 11:33.931
That you had the temerity

11:34.068 --> 11:36.758
to investigate my out of court
opinions is one thing,

11:36.896 --> 11:39.862
but that you would seek
to undermine and embarrass me,

11:40.000 --> 11:41.310
- is another.
- Your Honor...

11:41.448 --> 11:44.310
Miss Campbell,
I would think long and hard

11:44.448 --> 11:46.448
before asking me
to recuse myself.

11:46.586 --> 11:49.758
Yeah, thought about it.
We still want you to step down.

11:50.517 --> 11:54.275
You want another judge?
Be my guest.

11:55.103 --> 11:59.551
But, as I tell my grandkids,
actions have their consequences.

12:00.241 --> 12:02.551
Back on the record.

12:02.689 --> 12:04.827
Defense motion is granted.

12:07.758 --> 12:10.000
Wow. That is a lot
of political capital

12:10.137 --> 12:12.413
to spend on a roll of the dice
you'll probably lose.

12:12.551 --> 12:14.413
What part of "I don't think
that's a good idea"

12:14.551 --> 12:16.793
made you think I was down
with what you just did?

12:16.931 --> 12:19.448
Shit, Tracy, I'm sorry,
but it worked, right?

12:19.586 --> 12:21.896
That is not the point, Gwen.

12:25.551 --> 12:27.275
You know you can get
the case recalled.

12:27.413 --> 12:29.034
I can?

12:30.655 --> 12:32.275
AB.

12:41.034 --> 12:42.551
What?

12:43.793 --> 12:46.379
Yeah, get over here.
What is it?

12:47.344 --> 12:48.862
Your Honor.
I was wondering

12:49.000 --> 12:51.724
if you would be willing
to recall Mr. Reyes' case.

12:51.862 --> 12:53.517
The absconder
with the pit bull?

12:53.827 --> 12:55.482
No, we run a tight ship here,
kiddo.

12:55.620 --> 12:57.413
You're going to have
to learn to toughen up.

13:07.620 --> 13:10.482
You're going to give me
those puppy dog eyes all day?

13:11.551 --> 13:16.172
Yeah, well, I can't see you.
You're invisible.

13:24.965 --> 13:27.103
The sincerity is killing me.

13:28.379 --> 13:31.965
Okay, fine.
Bring out the dog man.

13:34.448 --> 13:36.551
Do you understand
the charge against you?

13:37.034 --> 13:39.103
- How do you plead?
- Actually, your Honor,

13:39.241 --> 13:41.172
I was hoping we could revisit
the issue with bail.

13:41.310 --> 13:44.275
No one's doing a trial over
dog walking tickets, counselor.

13:44.413 --> 13:47.344
He pleads guilty to a violation,
that's not a crime

13:47.482 --> 13:49.310
and he pays a fine
and then he can go home.

13:49.448 --> 13:51.413
- But, he didn't do it.
- I don't care.

13:51.551 --> 13:53.275
You want to waste the court's
time with this stuff,

13:53.413 --> 13:54.620
he can just post the bail.

13:54.758 --> 13:56.172
The point is,
he can't pay the bail.

13:56.310 --> 13:58.034
Look, I'm done with this
nonsense, forget about it.

13:58.172 --> 13:59.965
Next case.

14:00.103 --> 14:04.344
Hey. It's the last time I do
something nice for you, kiddo.

14:18.482 --> 14:23.275
All rise. The Honorable Judge
Martha Radcliff presiding.

14:26.827 --> 14:28.896
You were saying something
about rolling the dice?

14:29.034 --> 14:30.379
You got lucky.

14:30.793 --> 14:32.551
Let's bring in the jury.

14:36.862 --> 14:40.275
Oh my God, baby!
Are you okay?

14:40.551 --> 14:44.689
Huh? Okay, are you bleeding?
You got broken bones?

14:44.827 --> 14:48.655
What the hell were you thinking? Why would you take my car?

14:48.793 --> 14:51.965
You could have killed somebody
or your goddamn self!

14:52.103 --> 14:55.344
What the hell do I gotta do
to get this through to you?

14:56.758 --> 14:58.724
What the hell
is wrong with you, boy?

14:58.862 --> 15:01.586
Huh? You mind
your goddamn business.

15:04.413 --> 15:07.793
Get up! Get yo ass up!
Get up!

15:10.896 --> 15:13.586
Dr. Montgomery,
as Jason Lyon's caseworker,

15:13.724 --> 15:16.448
you examined him
after he was hit with a belt.

15:16.827 --> 15:18.000
I'm handing you
what's been marked

15:18.137 --> 15:20.344
as People's Exhibits
2 through 4,

15:20.482 --> 15:25.206
an x-ray of Jason's broken arm
and photos of his injuries.

15:25.517 --> 15:27.965
What was Jason's condition
after the incident?

15:28.103 --> 15:31.758
You can see the red marks
and welts here,

15:32.379 --> 15:35.620
and of course, the broken arm.

15:36.068 --> 15:38.103
This incident was painful,

15:38.241 --> 15:41.655
extremely humiliating
and traumatizing.

15:41.793 --> 15:44.034
- Aren't you going to object?
- No.

15:44.172 --> 15:46.206
It wasn't at all reasonable.

15:46.482 --> 15:49.551
Objection, speculation and move
to strike the last statement,

15:49.689 --> 15:51.931
improper opinion
and ultimate question.

15:52.068 --> 15:53.586
- Overruled.
- Your Honor!

15:53.724 --> 15:56.310
Overruled. Counselor.

15:56.896 --> 16:00.758
- Nothing further.
- We'll resume after lunch.

16:06.068 --> 16:10.137
- What's wrong?
- Honestly, I'm not sure.

16:12.586 --> 16:13.931
Why didn't you object

16:14.068 --> 16:15.482
to Montgomery's
testimony unreasonableness?

16:15.620 --> 16:17.310
Because I thought
we'd look like idiots.

16:17.448 --> 16:19.137
She's an expert
rendering an opinion.

16:19.275 --> 16:21.482
Getting overruled just gave her
testimony more credibility.

16:21.620 --> 16:22.896
But he was rendering a legal--

16:23.034 --> 16:24.551
I don't have to agree
with you, Gwen.

16:24.689 --> 16:26.379
Why do you have
such a problem with that?

16:26.517 --> 16:28.931
- I don't, I--
- You seem to.

16:29.448 --> 16:31.241
Look, forget it, just...
it's done, okay?

16:31.379 --> 16:33.000
What we got to do now
is we need to show

16:33.137 --> 16:35.137
that Donielle is a good mother
and not a monster

16:35.275 --> 16:36.896
and we need to emphasize
the part of the statute

16:37.034 --> 16:39.172
that says corporal punishment
is okay if you reasonably

16:39.310 --> 16:41.413
believe it's necessary
to maintain discipline.

16:41.551 --> 16:43.448
And so, the more misbehaving
your child is,

16:43.586 --> 16:46.586
the more reasonable
the spanking is.

16:46.724 --> 16:51.310
That is some misbehaving.
Look at the carnage he caused.

16:55.896 --> 16:58.620
So, we have the photos to show
the punishment fit the crime

16:58.758 --> 17:01.068
and that he needed
to be disciplined.

17:01.448 --> 17:05.000
But, the pictures are so boring.

17:06.275 --> 17:08.241
So, so, devious.

17:16.206 --> 17:17.655
- Watch that.
- Right there.

17:17.793 --> 17:19.931
- What's happening in life dawg?
- Life's happening, man.

17:20.068 --> 17:22.724
- Life?
- Yeah. Whooo!

17:22.862 --> 17:25.103
What was that?
Nothing, let's go, let's go!

17:25.241 --> 17:27.000
Where you've been, home boy?
You're too good for us

17:27.137 --> 17:28.310
and now you're working
for the man?

17:28.448 --> 17:30.827
- What if that?
- I got it, baby!

17:31.137 --> 17:33.482
- What?
- Good thing.

17:33.689 --> 17:36.448
Check it out, let's go.
Let's go, come on.

17:36.620 --> 17:40.000
You think you got skills. boy?
Oh, you're my bitch now.

17:41.413 --> 17:44.137
- What the hell was that, fool?
- I ain't nobody's bitch.

17:44.275 --> 17:46.689
I don't work for the man
and I don't work for the money.

17:46.827 --> 17:49.620
Do my job because don't nobody
give a damn about black people!

17:49.758 --> 17:51.379
Yo, we hear you, fam.

17:51.517 --> 17:54.068
You taking it to another level,
man, it's just jokes, baby.

17:54.206 --> 17:55.655
It ain't funny.

17:55.793 --> 17:58.896
Ain't nothing funny about
being a black man in America.

18:00.034 --> 18:02.517
Don't call me a bitch again.

18:08.482 --> 18:10.931
Judge Lasker is a wonderful man,

18:11.068 --> 18:13.586
but perhaps
he was a bit in tempered.

18:13.758 --> 18:17.379
- Fear not, we'll make it right.
- Thank you so much, your Honor.

18:17.517 --> 18:19.862
I'm sorry, Judge, we looked.
Guy's not in the back.

18:20.034 --> 18:23.655
What? He was just arraigned
at the end of the last session.

18:23.793 --> 18:25.896
I'm sorry, counselor.
I can't release him

18:26.034 --> 18:27.413
if he's not physically
before me.

18:27.551 --> 18:28.896
Isn't there some other way?

18:29.034 --> 18:30.758
Can't you order Corrections
to let him go?

18:30.896 --> 18:33.724
I can issue a cut and release,
but that could take day or two.

18:33.896 --> 18:35.655
It wasn't even his dog,
please.

18:35.793 --> 18:39.620
If you can find him, bring him
to me and I'll let him out.

18:40.862 --> 18:44.827
Let's go. I will not live in
a Kafka story another minute.

18:47.793 --> 18:51.275
Dr. Montgomery, teachers are
mandatory reporters of abuse?

18:51.413 --> 18:52.758
Correct.

18:52.896 --> 18:54.275
Yet, in the five years
Jason has attended school,

18:54.413 --> 18:56.758
none of his teachers ever
reported signs of abuse?

18:56.896 --> 18:59.310
- That's correct.
- In fact, Jason's teachers

18:59.448 --> 19:01.655
wrote very positive things
about Jason's mother,

19:01.793 --> 19:03.827
- Miss Lyons, didn't they?
- They did.

19:04.068 --> 19:06.689
So, Miss Lyons would appear
to be a good parent, right?

19:07.137 --> 19:09.172
And if a good parent
reasonably believed

19:09.310 --> 19:10.793
her child's welfare was at risk

19:10.931 --> 19:13.931
or she needed to correct
a seriously misbehaving child,

19:14.103 --> 19:16.068
she would act accordingly,
wouldn't she?

19:16.206 --> 19:18.172
Hitting can't be
for a child's welfare.

19:18.310 --> 19:19.620
Really?

19:27.793 --> 19:29.206
Objection. What's all this?

19:29.344 --> 19:30.758
Best evidence rule,
your Honor.

19:30.896 --> 19:32.793
Why look at photos
of the damage Jason caused

19:32.931 --> 19:34.482
when you can have
the real thing?

19:34.620 --> 19:36.000
I'll allow it.

19:41.586 --> 19:45.724
Dr. Montgomery, this was once
a part of a sidewalk mailbox.

19:47.137 --> 19:51.517
And this was
a side mirror on a car.

19:52.655 --> 19:56.344
Jason hit both of these in turn,
here and here.

19:56.517 --> 20:00.103
And here, he ran over
a child's tricycle.

20:04.137 --> 20:07.000
What if a child
had been riding this?

20:07.137 --> 20:09.344
Corporal punishment
in this context could be used

20:09.482 --> 20:12.137
for the purpose of maintaining
discipline, couldn't it?

20:12.482 --> 20:14.103
Or for promoting
the welfare of a child

20:14.241 --> 20:16.068
for driving home
the point that what he did

20:16.206 --> 20:18.000
was incredibly serious
and dangerous.

20:18.137 --> 20:20.482
She didn't spank her son,
she beat him.

20:20.620 --> 20:22.793
Not my question.
My question is whether

20:22.931 --> 20:24.793
given the seriousness
of what her son did,

20:24.931 --> 20:27.655
she could've reasonably believed
that the force she used

20:27.793 --> 20:30.137
was for the purpose
of maintaining discipline

20:30.275 --> 20:32.034
or promoting his welfare.

20:32.241 --> 20:34.965
I suppose that's what she could
have thought she was doing.

20:35.103 --> 20:36.482
Nothing further.

20:39.413 --> 20:42.103
If your child ran into a mailbox
with your car,

20:42.241 --> 20:43.448
- would you hit him?
- No.

20:43.586 --> 20:44.758
If he sideswiped a car,

20:44.896 --> 20:46.275
ran over a tricycle
smashing it flat,

20:46.413 --> 20:48.310
- would you hit him then?
- I wouldn't.

20:48.620 --> 20:51.344
There would be consequences.
I would talk to him.

20:51.482 --> 20:53.482
You would talk to him.

20:53.620 --> 20:55.965
And why would you talk
instead of hit?

20:56.206 --> 20:59.344
Well, for one, studies
show corporal punishment

20:59.482 --> 21:01.931
results in a decrease
in gray matter in the brain,

21:02.068 --> 21:03.931
which inhibits
mental development.

21:04.068 --> 21:07.724
It also leads to an increase
in aggression, delinquency,

21:07.862 --> 21:10.137
- mental illness and drug abuse.
- Objection.

21:10.275 --> 21:12.206
Your Honor, corporal punishment
is not on trial here.

21:12.344 --> 21:15.068
- The law actually allows it.
- Sustained.

21:16.137 --> 21:18.724
Is there anything
that could reasonably justify

21:18.862 --> 21:22.517
the type of corporal punishment
Miss Lyons used?

21:23.758 --> 21:26.482
- No.
- Thank you, Doctor.

21:32.241 --> 21:34.724
I can't read this jury
right now.

21:36.965 --> 21:39.689
I can. They're not with us.

21:39.827 --> 21:41.620
People cannot just disappear
into the system.

21:41.758 --> 21:43.103
We don't have him,
the courts have him.

21:43.241 --> 21:44.655
I just tried the courts.
They said you had him.

21:44.793 --> 21:46.137
I don't know
what to tell you, counselor.

21:46.275 --> 21:47.413
He'll probably turn up,
they always do.

21:47.551 --> 21:48.793
Unacceptable.

21:50.965 --> 21:52.931
Hey, you can't go back there.

21:53.068 --> 21:54.862
Mr. Reyes?

21:57.275 --> 21:59.172
Fabian Reyes.

22:02.724 --> 22:04.482
Fabian!

22:05.275 --> 22:08.068
I lost my job.
I kept asking to call them,

22:08.206 --> 22:11.206
but the cops wouldn't let me use
the phone until they fired me.

22:11.344 --> 22:13.310
I'll call your boss
and explain the situation, okay?

22:13.448 --> 22:16.586
Here's my card if you need me
to follow up with you.

22:17.551 --> 22:19.448
You know those guys
in the cell,

22:19.620 --> 22:21.137
they said you'd never
come for me.

22:21.586 --> 22:23.758
The more questions I asked,
the longer I'd be in there for,

22:23.896 --> 22:26.103
they said the cops
would just disappear me.

22:26.241 --> 22:30.413
So, thank you for finding me.

22:35.586 --> 22:37.931
Donielle should have plead.
The jury hates her.

22:38.068 --> 22:39.896
- A white jury maybe.
- I don't know.

22:40.034 --> 22:41.344
Montgomery made
a pretty strong case

22:41.482 --> 22:43.379
that it's never okay
to beat your kids,

22:43.517 --> 22:45.413
- black or white.
- She didn't beat her kid.

22:45.551 --> 22:48.034
- She disciplined him.
- Let's just be real, Gwen.

22:48.172 --> 22:50.206
She didn't just give him a slap,
she beat him hard enough

22:50.344 --> 22:53.034
with a belt that he tried
to get away and broke his arm.

22:53.344 --> 22:56.103
I don't care what the law says,
you don't beat your kids.

22:56.241 --> 22:57.655
- Period.
- Okay, wake up, Trace.

22:57.793 --> 22:59.344
Donielle's husband is overseas.

22:59.482 --> 23:02.620
She's basically a single mom
raising a black boy in the hood.

23:02.896 --> 23:04.724
She spanked him
to keep him alive,

23:04.862 --> 23:06.862
because if she didn't whip
some sense into him, he'd end up

23:07.000 --> 23:09.379
in jail or in a body bag
and that is being real.

23:09.517 --> 23:12.655
I get that. I do,
but hitting your kids,

23:12.793 --> 23:15.931
it teaches fear, not obedience.
It is worse in the long run.

23:16.068 --> 23:17.758
Well white people have
the luxury of thinking

23:17.896 --> 23:20.517
- about the long run.
- Don't throw white privilege.

23:20.655 --> 23:23.241
- I get it. I just disagree.
- Because you never lived

23:23.379 --> 23:24.793
in the hood and don't know
what it means--

23:24.931 --> 23:27.896
You have no idea
what I know or don't know, Gwen.

23:28.482 --> 23:31.413
Tracy, what is going on
with you? Hey!

23:32.068 --> 23:35.068
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine. I'm just frustrated.

23:35.206 --> 23:38.000
- With me?
- With the case.

23:40.034 --> 23:41.482
Okay, well look,

23:41.620 --> 23:43.758
all I'm saying is that
the black jurors are an asset.

23:43.896 --> 23:45.448
We just have to remind them
of the psychology

23:45.586 --> 23:47.482
of raising black boys
and Donielle's state of mind

23:47.620 --> 23:49.793
and then they can teach
the white jurors.

23:50.137 --> 23:54.482
- It's really our only move.
- Well, you're right about that.

23:54.689 --> 23:56.517
So, you should
do Donielle's direct.

23:56.655 --> 23:59.827
Black defendant, black lawyer,
talking to black jurors.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.344
- Okay.
- Okay.

24:03.724 --> 24:05.724
My bad about earlier, man,
I was bugging.

24:05.931 --> 24:07.724
Nah, the cops
got into your head.

24:07.862 --> 24:09.896
You got me jacked up
for a minute, though.

24:10.689 --> 24:14.862
You still got that same temper
you had when we were shorties.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.586
- Hell, yes.
- Hell.

24:17.827 --> 24:20.620
They ain't putting no respect
on a black president's name.

24:20.793 --> 24:22.896
- I don't know how I got a shot.
- Yeah.

24:23.034 --> 24:25.862
Same shit, different brother,
we all been there.

24:26.482 --> 24:30.068
Kissing pavement, handcuff,
pig car, the whole nine.

24:30.206 --> 24:32.655
Just cause what, we brown
and they got power?

24:33.862 --> 24:38.137
I don't know, man. Sometimes,
shit just gets exhausting.

24:40.655 --> 24:42.862
- Yo, you know what I need?
- A slice.

24:43.000 --> 24:47.758
Dang, Nico's is about to close.
We got about eight minutes.

24:49.103 --> 24:51.172
Last one in the door pays!

24:52.068 --> 24:54.517
Oh, yeah, you're buying.

25:01.758 --> 25:04.103
Miss Lyons, why didn't you use
other disciplinary methods

25:04.241 --> 25:07.206
with Jason?
Warn him. Do timeouts.

25:07.517 --> 25:10.103
Because that don't work.
Not in my situation.

25:10.241 --> 25:13.310
Can you tell the court
what you mean by "my situation"?

25:13.448 --> 25:15.724
I mean the high school
that my son is going to

25:15.862 --> 25:19.655
in a few years, there's
about 100 security cameras,

25:19.793 --> 25:21.965
police officers in the hallways.

25:22.103 --> 25:24.517
You don't get detention,
you get arrested.

25:24.655 --> 25:29.586
- But Jason's only 9 years old.
- My son, he is a good kid.

25:30.689 --> 25:34.275
He gets good grades,
but he wants to be cool.

25:34.413 --> 25:37.620
His dad is stationed overseas.
He can't be here to role model,

25:37.758 --> 25:41.206
so Jason sees the other kids
on the corner.

25:41.344 --> 25:44.068
He wants to be just like them,
a thug.

25:44.586 --> 25:48.103
- Where is your neighborhood?
- 187th and Overlook.

25:49.034 --> 25:51.965
Would it surprise you to hear
that just since 2003,

25:52.103 --> 25:54.034
there have been 97 murders

25:54.172 --> 25:58.724
and 14,654 major
felony offenses in that area?

25:58.862 --> 26:01.275
No. You know, some kids

26:01.482 --> 26:04.103
go to birthday parties
and sleepovers.

26:04.517 --> 26:06.862
Our neighborhood,
we go to kids' funerals.

26:07.586 --> 26:10.965
And my son
is a black boy in America

26:11.103 --> 26:13.827
born with two strikes
against him.

26:14.379 --> 26:17.275
He can't make the same mistakes
as white boys make.

26:18.931 --> 26:20.586
Your Honor, may we approach?

26:27.103 --> 26:29.862
The defense is trying to argue
some kind of cultural defense.

26:30.000 --> 26:31.827
They're saying that the danger
to boys in certain

26:31.965 --> 26:34.241
black communities is higher
than in white communities.

26:34.379 --> 26:35.896
Because it is.

26:36.034 --> 26:38.724
And therefore, black parents
are somehow entitled to use

26:38.862 --> 26:41.137
greater force against their
children than white parents?

26:41.275 --> 26:43.172
I don't think so.
There can't be separate rules

26:43.310 --> 26:44.931
for black people
and white people.

26:45.068 --> 26:47.551
Your Honor, we're not arguing
for a racial exemption here.

26:47.689 --> 26:49.137
But, you're implying one.

26:49.551 --> 26:52.310
Counselor, you can't argue
a cultural defense here.

26:52.448 --> 26:53.793
You are to stick
to justification.

26:53.931 --> 26:56.172
But there's a cultural angle
to justification.

26:56.310 --> 26:58.586
We can't argue one
without the other in this case.

26:58.724 --> 27:01.586
It's dangerous to argue
that black boys require

27:01.724 --> 27:04.206
more severe discipline
to be kept in line.

27:04.344 --> 27:06.068
- That's not what we're saying.
- We're saying black boys have

27:06.206 --> 27:08.344
particular perils facing them
that justify their parents

27:08.482 --> 27:09.896
using particular force
with them.

27:10.034 --> 27:11.793
Well, that's not
what white folks hear.

27:11.931 --> 27:14.206
They hear that black boys
need to be beaten.

27:14.344 --> 27:15.862
- I don't think that's--
- I think that the jury

27:16.000 --> 27:18.310
is capable of making
the distinction, your Honor.

27:18.448 --> 27:19.862
Well, I don't.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.310
So, if I catch even
a whiff of a cultural defense,

27:22.448 --> 27:25.172
I'm declaring a mistrial
and you can be damn sure

27:25.310 --> 27:27.965
that the retrial will be
in front of Judge Blackburn.

27:29.103 --> 27:31.172
Now, step back.

27:33.172 --> 27:34.931
I guess the black judge
isn't turning out to be

27:35.068 --> 27:36.862
quite the soul sister
you thought she'd be.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.482
Have several seats, Milltown.

27:41.241 --> 27:42.827
It's like I wasn't
even standing there.

27:42.965 --> 27:44.931
- What are you talking about?
- You interrupted me.

27:45.068 --> 27:47.137
- You talked over me.
- What is wrong with you?

27:47.275 --> 27:48.896
- This is my case.
- It's our case.

27:49.034 --> 27:51.172
- No, I asked you for help.
- Oh, so now I'm the help.

27:51.310 --> 27:52.827
Don't twist my words.

27:52.965 --> 27:54.896
See, this is what you do,
you take over.

27:55.034 --> 27:56.620
You did that with the plea,
you did it with the recusal,

27:56.758 --> 27:59.344
you did it with the expert
and now with the judge.

27:59.482 --> 28:01.827
God, you think you know
better than anyone else.

28:02.034 --> 28:04.068
Girl, I take over,
that's what I do.

28:04.206 --> 28:05.793
Since when does it
make you so mad?

28:05.931 --> 28:07.689
You think you got it
all together, Gwen,

28:07.827 --> 28:09.275
but you're just a hot mess.

28:09.413 --> 28:11.413
I've been bailing your ass out
for a long time.

28:11.551 --> 28:13.310
This is the third month
in a row I've had to pay

28:13.448 --> 28:16.758
- your share of electric bill.
- I will pay the electric bill.

28:16.896 --> 28:19.724
It's not about
the electric bill, Gwen.

28:20.827 --> 28:22.586
I have never seen
your fuse this short.

28:22.724 --> 28:24.448
Do you want to tell me what
the hell is going on with you?

28:24.586 --> 28:26.206
No, not really, no.

28:29.275 --> 28:31.379
Ah!

28:32.000 --> 28:33.206
Let's just say this case

28:33.344 --> 28:35.689
is bringing a lot of stuff
up for me, okay?

28:38.448 --> 28:41.275
My dad, he used to beat
our collective asses

28:41.413 --> 28:43.068
and I do mean beat.

28:43.448 --> 28:45.068
I still got
the scars to prove it

28:45.206 --> 28:48.689
and when I look at Donielle,
I just see my own childhood.

28:50.724 --> 28:52.275
- Sorry.
- Oh, my God.

28:52.413 --> 28:55.586
Why didn't you tell me?
No wonder you're such a mess.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.241
Ah.

29:00.482 --> 29:03.689
So crazy because I look
at Donielle

29:04.413 --> 29:06.689
and I think maybe if my father
had whooped David more,

29:06.827 --> 29:09.793
he wouldn't be in prison.

29:10.310 --> 29:11.689
Your daddy
never whooped you guys?

29:11.827 --> 29:15.586
Never once.
Remember that mom in Baltimore

29:15.724 --> 29:17.827
who found her son in the riots
and whooped his ass?

29:17.965 --> 29:19.586
- Yeah.
- When I saw that, I thought,

29:19.724 --> 29:22.827
man, that kid is lucky
to have a mom who gives a shit.

29:23.172 --> 29:24.827
God. It made me cringe

29:24.965 --> 29:26.758
and not just
because it gave me flashbacks,

29:26.896 --> 29:30.965
it was the way some white people
just seem to love her

29:31.172 --> 29:33.137
just smacking her kid
upside the head.

29:33.275 --> 29:34.551
- Really?
- Yeah.

29:34.689 --> 29:36.000
I mean, you should have seen
my Facebook page.

29:36.137 --> 29:39.137
There was like this...
this glee.

29:42.068 --> 29:43.517
Wait.

29:44.068 --> 29:47.310
What if we use white people's
racism against them?

29:49.068 --> 29:50.344
Oh, we're back on the case?

29:50.482 --> 29:51.586
I thought we were having
a girlfriend moment.

29:51.724 --> 29:53.344
No, seriously, seriously.

29:53.482 --> 29:54.931
Radcliff thinks we're leaning
into white people's perception

29:55.068 --> 29:56.793
of black boys
as being like...

29:56.931 --> 29:58.137
- A threat?
- Yeah,

29:58.275 --> 29:59.827
the frightening shadow
in the dark.

30:00.000 --> 30:04.034
So, we play the race card,
but we play the white race card.

30:05.103 --> 30:09.103
Oh, that's good. That's good.

30:11.896 --> 30:14.310
- So, are we good?
- Yeah.

30:15.034 --> 30:17.034
You get on my freaking
nerves sometimes, girl,

30:17.172 --> 30:22.137
- but oh my lord. I love you.
- I love you too, Trace.

30:25.586 --> 30:29.206
Donielle Lyons knows her son
Jason better than anyone.

30:29.724 --> 30:31.896
She knows when he's advanced
his reading level,

30:32.034 --> 30:35.034
even before his teacher.
She knows that he needs

30:35.172 --> 30:37.586
twice as much physical activity
as most kids

30:37.724 --> 30:41.482
and what she needs to do to make
sure he learns good behavior.

30:42.413 --> 30:44.586
Back when I was a little girl
in North Carolina,

30:44.724 --> 30:47.206
the mamas used to hang over
the fences and gossip

30:47.344 --> 30:48.793
about each other.

30:48.931 --> 30:50.620
Who made peanut
butter sandwiches

30:50.758 --> 30:53.310
and who just slathered bread
with pork fat?

30:53.448 --> 30:57.206
Who kept their kids in line
and who let their kids run wild?

30:57.379 --> 31:00.103
They would even predict
the future success of your child

31:00.241 --> 31:02.310
based on your skills
as a mother.

31:03.000 --> 31:07.448
Today, we do the same thing,
only now it's over Twitter.

31:07.758 --> 31:09.275
If Jason grew up to steal cars,

31:09.413 --> 31:12.000
you would say Donielle
should've been a better mother.

31:12.137 --> 31:13.724
She didn't discipline enough.

31:14.517 --> 31:17.793
Well, I say you can't have
it both ways.

31:18.034 --> 31:20.482
Would you rather have Donielle
whoop her son

31:20.620 --> 31:24.172
like I know half of you
have done to your kids

31:24.862 --> 31:28.172
or would you rather
have him become a thug?

31:28.931 --> 31:30.620
Because you can't prosecute her

31:30.758 --> 31:33.965
and then complain
when he steals your car.

31:35.517 --> 31:36.896
Let's be clear.

31:37.068 --> 31:40.586
A swat on the butt with a hand,
that's a spanking,

31:40.724 --> 31:44.931
but what Donielle Lyons did
was beat his backside repeatedly

31:45.068 --> 31:48.758
with a leather belt.
He cried for her to stop.

31:49.620 --> 31:53.379
She left raised welts
on his skin. He's nine.

31:53.689 --> 31:57.862
Donielle inflicted bodily injury
on a child.

31:58.344 --> 31:59.896
She hit him so hard

32:00.034 --> 32:03.068
that when he tried to run away,
he fell and broke his arm.

32:04.586 --> 32:06.310
Now, the defense
would have you think

32:06.448 --> 32:10.172
that this is routine discipline
to thwart future infractions.

32:11.172 --> 32:16.172
I want you to see it
for what it is: child abuse.

32:17.793 --> 32:20.931
And you need to hold Donielle
accountable for that.

32:42.344 --> 32:44.103
Why the long face, Bambi?
I heard you went

32:44.241 --> 32:47.310
all the way into the jail
to find your lost client.

32:47.448 --> 32:50.034
He was in jail for two days
for a dog walking ticket,

32:50.172 --> 32:51.586
I mean, how does
that even happen?

32:51.724 --> 32:53.344
Oh come on, your cherry
must be popped by now.

32:53.482 --> 32:56.034
Why don't you quit acting
like a virgin in a whore house.

32:56.448 --> 32:58.206
Why are you so mean?

32:59.482 --> 33:01.551
Go grab us a couple
more martinis.

33:01.965 --> 33:03.655
You know I don't work
for you, right?

33:06.448 --> 33:09.310
Judge Sullivan.
Congratulations.

33:09.517 --> 33:14.689
Well, thank you. Have you, um...
Have you seen my Gwen?

33:17.965 --> 33:19.482
She's not coming, is she?

33:20.344 --> 33:23.137
You know she avoids me
when she's angry at me

33:23.689 --> 33:26.103
or when she's behind
in her bills.

33:27.034 --> 33:30.655
So, how are you girls doing
with your bills?

33:31.655 --> 33:33.862
Good, good.

33:35.793 --> 33:37.000
Mm-hmm.

33:45.413 --> 33:49.344
- You don't know who I am.
- Should I?

33:49.931 --> 33:51.965
I'm Audrey Dotson.

33:52.517 --> 33:56.068
Oh. Judge Dotson's wife.
Pleasure.

34:00.137 --> 34:04.344
- You're not the first you know.
- Beg your pardon?

34:04.827 --> 34:06.551
I know you're sleeping
with my husband.

34:06.689 --> 34:08.862
- I'm sorry, I--
- Don't bother.

34:09.310 --> 34:11.655
You're not the first
and you won't be the last,

34:11.793 --> 34:15.206
so you go have your fun,
but know this.

34:15.586 --> 34:17.586
He always comes home.

34:19.758 --> 34:23.379
And frankly, he's done better.

34:44.413 --> 34:46.758
In the matter of the People
versus Donielle Lyons,

34:46.896 --> 34:49.103
on the charge of assault
in the second degree,

34:49.482 --> 34:51.344
we the jury find
the defendant...

34:51.586 --> 34:52.965
guilty.

34:58.862 --> 35:01.344
Donielle, we are so sorry.

35:04.896 --> 35:07.586
Thank you. Thank you.

35:20.620 --> 35:22.551
I have my quarrels
with hitting your kid,

35:22.689 --> 35:25.068
but 18 months of state
and losing custody.

35:25.206 --> 35:28.068
As if he's better off
without his mother.

35:28.241 --> 35:29.689
Jesus.

35:31.241 --> 35:33.965
Let me see if I understand.
You recuse Blackburn,

35:34.103 --> 35:36.862
even though I explicitly
told you not to and you lost?

35:37.275 --> 35:38.931
Take your vacation days,
all of them.

35:39.137 --> 35:41.068
But Tom, she was not going
to give us--

35:41.379 --> 35:43.551
Every part of me wants
to suspend you right now,

35:43.689 --> 35:45.517
so don't push it.
I don't want to see your face

35:45.655 --> 35:47.034
until those days
have zeroed out.

35:47.689 --> 35:50.448
- Am I making myself clear?
- Yes.

35:54.034 --> 35:57.000
- I hate losing.
- Yeah, me too.

36:33.655 --> 36:35.137
So, what happened?
L or W?

36:35.275 --> 36:36.448
We lost.

36:36.586 --> 36:39.206
- Okay, so are we doing this?
- Yeah.

37:30.931 --> 37:34.620
Finally.
I was worried about you.

37:36.068 --> 37:37.827
Ah.

37:39.586 --> 37:40.758
You and Tracy lose?

37:40.896 --> 37:43.000
Yeah, they hauled
our client off in cuffs.

37:50.000 --> 37:51.827
I'm glad you came over.

37:52.862 --> 37:54.241
You alright?

37:57.517 --> 38:00.689
- Charles Theodore Riggs.
- I'm alright.

38:02.172 --> 38:04.275
You are far from alright.

38:06.724 --> 38:08.448
I hate them all.

38:09.965 --> 38:12.689
Every last one of them cops
is a piece of shit.

38:21.620 --> 38:24.137
You should have seen
the way they looked at me.

38:25.413 --> 38:27.517
Like I was garbage.

38:31.517 --> 38:35.068
Our clients get pulled up
on all the time by the cops.

38:35.965 --> 38:41.241
Stopped, frisked, searched
on the way to work.

38:41.379 --> 38:43.413
Kid sitting
on the curb handcuffed

38:43.551 --> 38:45.103
because he was wearing
a hoodie on the way

38:45.241 --> 38:48.344
to the bodega to get some milk
for his mom.

38:48.586 --> 38:49.862
We see it every day.

38:50.379 --> 38:53.551
Which I don't know
how I could possibly think

38:53.724 --> 38:56.000
that it wouldn't happen
to me now.

38:57.689 --> 39:02.689
You know, if I paid my taxes,
if I got a law degree.

39:03.137 --> 39:04.689
If I wore a suit.

39:07.724 --> 39:12.344
Somehow, stupidly,
I got comfortable.

39:13.827 --> 39:20.000
Thought I was inoculated
and boom, they got me.

39:25.482 --> 39:27.517
No escaping it either.

39:27.655 --> 39:31.206
If you're a black man,
it's only a matter of time

39:31.344 --> 39:36.241
before the police...
emasculate you.

39:40.758 --> 39:44.965
You know, I thought I was...
that I had broken free.

39:47.034 --> 39:51.206
I thought
when they looked at me,

39:53.413 --> 39:55.965
they could see m...

39:58.000 --> 39:59.689
could see me.

40:00.724 --> 40:04.344
Not just another nigga.

40:07.275 --> 40:09.172
Charlie.

40:13.793 --> 40:15.413
I see you.

40:34.724 --> 40:36.137
Next time, on "In Contempt"...

40:36.275 --> 40:37.620
Still coming
to the wedding shower, right?

40:37.758 --> 40:39.206
Of course.
I'm bringing Charlie.

40:39.344 --> 40:40.965
- Charlie from the office?
- Yeah, we're friends.

40:41.103 --> 40:42.827
What's up with you
not opening your mail?

40:43.000 --> 40:44.551
Monthly bills.

40:44.689 --> 40:46.448
To maintain my self-esteem,
I open ones I can't pay last.

40:46.586 --> 40:49.137
Ah, live like a superstar
on a reality star's budget.

40:49.275 --> 40:50.689
I'm cheating on her with you.

40:50.827 --> 40:52.413
Well, if you're so worried
about it, stop cheating.

40:52.655 --> 40:55.275
Just cause I'm new does not mean
you can take advantage of me.

40:55.413 --> 40:57.379
Don't mistake my generosity
for weakness.

40:57.551 --> 40:59.827
What's the one thing Bennett
would save in a fire?

40:59.965 --> 41:02.241
- His manuscripts.
- Gwen got it.

41:02.620 --> 41:06.620
You are the queen
of bad choices.
