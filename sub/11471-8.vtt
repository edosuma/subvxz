00:22.621 --> 00:24.789
Use it on me.

00:24.790 --> 00:26.708
This is all I got here.

00:26.709 --> 00:29.710
Please, please. It feels
so good when you do it.

00:34.717 --> 00:36.667
Douse it.

00:38.854 --> 00:40.637
Hurry.

00:57.873 --> 01:00.492
My father was right.

01:00.493 --> 01:03.527
The devil is in all of us.

01:07.216 --> 01:10.867
My father preaches on
weekends around the county.

01:12.388 --> 01:15.840
He never met a person he didn't
believe had a sinner inside them.

01:15.841 --> 01:18.810
Oh, it must have been great
fun growing up with that.

01:18.811 --> 01:22.129
Guilty before you're even tried.

01:23.065 --> 01:26.234
If he could see me here with you...

01:26.235 --> 01:30.554
Men like that would rather be proven
right than anything else on earth.

01:34.076 --> 01:38.446
You know, my father is
as devout as they come.

01:38.447 --> 01:40.865
He prays, quotes scripture,

01:40.866 --> 01:43.483
never misses a Sunday.

01:44.703 --> 01:47.005
He's also a drunkard.

01:47.006 --> 01:50.240
A mean, violent son of a bitch.

01:51.460 --> 01:53.545
After the war, he slaughtered Indians

01:53.546 --> 01:56.097
in the Colorado territory for a living.

01:56.098 --> 01:58.433
He believes the former forgives the latter.

01:58.434 --> 02:01.301
I believe the latter's all that matters.

02:03.055 --> 02:06.590
That's the devil your
father should be speaking of.

02:09.979 --> 02:14.065
Sex, pleasure,

02:14.066 --> 02:16.566
immodesty...

02:18.654 --> 02:21.104
us here now...

02:22.575 --> 02:24.858
this is no sin.

02:27.379 --> 02:31.466
Will you be there on Judgment
Day to make my case, then?

02:31.467 --> 02:34.284
God's not watching.

02:35.304 --> 02:37.472
He's too busy not saving sick children

02:37.473 --> 02:40.008
and letting people starve.

02:40.009 --> 02:41.759
But if He does exist, He's the one

02:41.760 --> 02:44.177
that should be doing the atoning, not you.

02:45.431 --> 02:47.714
Don't say things like that.

02:50.269 --> 02:53.136
You're here with me now.

02:55.774 --> 02:58.275
Do you want to be or not?

03:00.663 --> 03:02.863
I do.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.262
Good.

03:29.191 --> 03:30.892
Good morning, Nurse Elkins.

03:30.893 --> 03:32.560
Good morning.

03:32.561 --> 03:35.113
There's a new exhibit at
the Metropolitan Museum

03:35.114 --> 03:37.815
that I think you might like.

03:37.816 --> 03:40.985
I didn't know if you had
any plans for this weekend,

03:40.986 --> 03:44.956
but I've really enjoyed our time together.

03:44.957 --> 03:46.457
And I promise there'll be none

03:46.458 --> 03:49.544
of these lurid, naked
French Polynesian women...

03:49.545 --> 03:51.129
Nurse Elkins. Dr. Chickering.

03:51.130 --> 03:53.298
- Good morning, Doctor.
- Doctor.

03:53.299 --> 03:55.583
There'll be none of these lurid,

03:55.584 --> 03:59.170
naked French Polynesian women
that they showed last year.

03:59.171 --> 04:04.175
Strictly lily ponds and
seascapes and the like.

04:04.176 --> 04:07.512
I think the curators have
duly learned their lessons.

04:07.513 --> 04:09.814
Why is there no cocaine?

04:09.815 --> 04:12.016
Because of the war in the Philippines.

04:12.017 --> 04:14.569
The guerillas have started
attacking our cargo ships.

04:14.570 --> 04:18.656
Some have been sunk, many
have been not able to pass.

04:18.656 --> 04:20.024
There are shortages of all sorts

04:20.024 --> 04:23.444
from chestnuts from
Malay, teakwood from Siam,

04:23.445 --> 04:25.913
- coca leaves from Java.
- I'm not interested in chestnuts

04:25.914 --> 04:27.865
or Siamese teakwood.

04:27.866 --> 04:32.036
We're a hospital. We need cocaine to exist.

04:32.037 --> 04:33.755
Well, then, our existence is in doubt

04:33.756 --> 04:35.623
because we used the last of it yesterday.

04:35.624 --> 04:37.709
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Doctor.

04:37.710 --> 04:40.094
Dr. Thackery, a few final questions

04:40.095 --> 04:41.713
about our hernia paper presentation.

04:41.714 --> 04:45.799
Fine, just bring it to my
office after the board meeting.

04:47.052 --> 04:49.387
Excuse me.

04:49.388 --> 04:51.773
Excuse me.

04:51.774 --> 04:53.224
That's unacceptable.

04:53.225 --> 04:56.611
How can they refuse to
pay? They're our insurer.

04:56.612 --> 04:58.730
Don't they know how this
will affect us financially?

04:58.731 --> 05:03.151
Our insurance is for flood
damage and fire protection.

05:03.152 --> 05:06.537
The riots would have had to
fall into one of those categories

05:06.538 --> 05:08.573
or be an act of God.

05:08.574 --> 05:11.576
And an act of godless doesn't qualify.

05:11.577 --> 05:13.461
Then what are we paying $35 a year

05:13.462 --> 05:15.046
in insurance premiums for?

05:15.047 --> 05:16.664
Had there been a flood or a fire...

05:16.665 --> 05:18.249
Seems we'd have been better off

05:18.250 --> 05:20.251
putting a torch to the place ourselves.

05:20.252 --> 05:21.919
It certainly would make
it easier to walk away

05:21.920 --> 05:23.838
from this wretched building.

05:23.839 --> 05:25.340
I say we explore it.

05:25.341 --> 05:28.059
Burn down the hospital? Is that legal?

05:28.060 --> 05:30.478
I was referring to a move uptown

05:30.479 --> 05:32.563
to a more hospitable location, Monsignor.

05:32.564 --> 05:35.016
The riots were unfortunate, but...

05:35.017 --> 05:36.734
They were a damned disgrace.

05:36.735 --> 05:38.236
Attacked by the very people to whom

05:38.237 --> 05:40.938
we practically give our
services away for free.

05:40.939 --> 05:42.490
Is there any more proof needed

05:42.491 --> 05:44.442
that it's time to abandon this place?

05:44.443 --> 05:48.529
Perhaps if we better understood
our losses, Mr. Barrow.

05:48.530 --> 05:50.947
Uh, yes. Ahem.

05:51.784 --> 05:55.002
I have compiled a partial list

05:55.003 --> 05:58.405
of what was damaged by the hooligans.

05:59.958 --> 06:03.344
19 windows, $3 each.

06:03.345 --> 06:06.547
Seven lab kits, $4 each.

06:06.548 --> 06:10.435
One upright cabinet, $2.10.

06:10.436 --> 06:14.272
One long cabinet, $5.40.

06:14.273 --> 06:16.190
One medium length cabinet...

06:16.191 --> 06:18.609
And the list goes on and on.

06:18.610 --> 06:21.062
What about the drugs?

06:21.063 --> 06:23.364
Drugs.

06:23.365 --> 06:25.366
We're out of cocaine.

06:25.367 --> 06:27.368
We're aware, Doctor.

06:27.369 --> 06:29.654
It's a vital anesthetic.
Our patients need it.

06:29.655 --> 06:31.038
Barrow?

06:31.039 --> 06:33.875
Short of launching a ship
and stopping the attacks,

06:33.876 --> 06:35.827
there's little we can do.

06:35.828 --> 06:37.712
There must be some
supplies of it in the city.

06:37.713 --> 06:40.631
I mean, it's your product. You're
only too happy to sell it to us.

06:40.632 --> 06:43.050
Now we can't even get a lick of it.

06:43.051 --> 06:44.969
There's just none to be had.

06:44.970 --> 06:46.754
Someone must have some.

06:46.755 --> 06:49.090
We supply all the
hospitals, so I assure you,

06:49.091 --> 06:52.143
they're all out or critically low.

06:52.144 --> 06:53.644
We can't make the drug without the leaves

06:53.645 --> 06:55.146
and we don't have the leaves.

06:55.147 --> 06:56.681
We haven't made or
shipped a bottle in weeks.

06:56.682 --> 06:58.516
So there are no stores of it?

06:58.517 --> 07:01.519
- No supplies of any kind?
- Whatever there was has been exhausted.

07:01.520 --> 07:03.154
Nothing for the beverage makers,

07:03.155 --> 07:06.441
the elixir chemists,
physicians or pharmacists.

07:06.442 --> 07:08.943
For the foreseeable
future, all institutions

07:08.944 --> 07:12.278
are going to have to work without cocaine.

07:13.532 --> 07:15.416
- What is it?
- That cow Mallon petitioned a judge

07:15.417 --> 07:17.418
to get herself removed from quarantine.

07:17.419 --> 07:19.370
- He's gonna hear it.
- Why?

07:19.371 --> 07:21.622
The tests proved she was
a carrier for typhoid.

07:21.623 --> 07:23.007
She needs to be kept away.

07:23.008 --> 07:25.209
Well, she got herself a lawyer to claim

07:25.210 --> 07:27.762
that she's been imprisoned
without due process.

07:27.763 --> 07:29.847
Hearing's on Tuesday.

07:29.848 --> 07:32.600
Maybe we can get her to make
some peach Melba for the judge.

07:32.601 --> 07:34.417
See what happens.

07:45.447 --> 07:47.430
Yes?

07:59.244 --> 08:01.611
I found them for you.

08:08.136 --> 08:11.287
I have three, but I wanted
to save one for us to share.

08:21.149 --> 08:23.099
Come in.

08:24.403 --> 08:26.237
Ah, good. Dr. Edwards.

08:26.238 --> 08:28.773
Thanks for your help, Nurse Elkins.

08:28.774 --> 08:30.807
Greatly appreciated.

08:39.952 --> 08:41.836
Ahem.

08:41.837 --> 08:43.337
Most of the changes I made

08:43.337 --> 08:45.739
are to the postoperative care section.

08:47.342 --> 08:49.260
It's a good paper.

08:49.261 --> 08:51.995
I only wish I were allowed in to hear it.

08:55.267 --> 08:56.717
- Are you all right?
- Fine.

08:56.718 --> 08:58.603
What time is the conference?

08:58.604 --> 09:00.304
- At 3:00.
- Great.

09:00.305 --> 09:02.639
I'll let you know how it goes.

09:07.112 --> 09:09.397
She's beautiful.

09:09.398 --> 09:11.232
And very healthy.

09:11.233 --> 09:13.985
That combination can only
mean she's of Irish stock.

09:15.871 --> 09:17.655
And you think she's about six months?

09:17.656 --> 09:19.624
Give or take.

09:19.625 --> 09:21.158
We named her Elisha.

09:21.159 --> 09:24.378
And we've been going by
her middle name Grace.

09:24.379 --> 09:27.498
But you and Eleanor
should make her your own.

09:27.499 --> 09:30.167
I'm sure you have ones in mind.

09:30.168 --> 09:32.585
No, Grace is perfect.

09:34.222 --> 09:37.173
Let's hope Eleanor falls
for her as quickly as I have.

09:41.847 --> 09:43.564
Gentlemen,

09:43.565 --> 09:45.850
welcome to the 83rd meeting

09:45.851 --> 09:50.271
of the Metropolitan Surgical Society.

09:50.272 --> 09:52.356
In past years, we have
been privileged to learn

09:52.357 --> 09:56.160
of so many new, groundbreaking discoveries

09:56.161 --> 09:58.195
and I'm certain that
this quarter's gathering

09:58.196 --> 10:00.498
will be no exception.

10:00.499 --> 10:03.284
I want to remind you all

10:03.285 --> 10:07.171
that nominations for the Thessler honoree

10:07.172 --> 10:09.040
for breakthroughs in nephrology

10:09.041 --> 10:12.176
are due by the end of this month.

10:12.177 --> 10:16.881
Our treasurer tells me that
we have a surplus of $22.07

10:16.882 --> 10:20.551
in the general fund, most
of which will be put toward

10:20.552 --> 10:23.387
our much needed chimney repair.

10:23.388 --> 10:26.190
A reminder... we will be sitting

10:26.191 --> 10:28.776
for the annual photograph
directly following

10:28.777 --> 10:30.760
today's reception.

10:46.878 --> 10:50.414
My coauthor Dr. Edwards and I
rebuild the canal's posterior wall

10:50.415 --> 10:53.968
using a three-layer repair
approximating the medial tissues.

10:53.969 --> 10:55.586
The transversalis fascia,

10:55.587 --> 10:57.471
the transversus abdominis muscle,

10:57.472 --> 10:59.640
and the internal oblique muscle

10:59.641 --> 11:01.926
to the edge of the inguinal ligament.

11:01.927 --> 11:03.811
Once the wall is created,

11:03.812 --> 11:06.597
we suture the external oblique aponeurosis,

11:06.598 --> 11:08.683
thus recreating the canal

11:08.684 --> 11:11.936
and the external inguinal ring.

11:11.937 --> 11:15.606
Now, failure rates for previous procedures

11:15.607 --> 11:17.575
ranged from 30 to 50%.

11:17.576 --> 11:19.610
In our admittedly small sample,

11:19.611 --> 11:23.364
the Thackery-Edwards method has
a reherniation rate of only 2%,

11:23.365 --> 11:25.616
and that is due to a patient not following

11:25.617 --> 11:27.785
proper postoperative instructions.

11:27.786 --> 11:30.037
Our full paper will be available to you all

11:30.038 --> 11:32.456
and we believe you'll have great
success with this new procedure,

11:32.457 --> 11:36.260
as it is probably the biggest advance

11:36.261 --> 11:40.546
in inguinal hernia surgery
in the last 100 years.

11:47.973 --> 11:50.357
Thank you, Dr. Thackery.

11:50.358 --> 11:53.561
Once again, you've come and impressed.

11:53.562 --> 11:56.313
Would you be willing to take any questions?

11:56.314 --> 11:58.231
No.

11:59.317 --> 12:01.317
Very well.

12:02.654 --> 12:05.823
Our next presenter has recently arrived

12:05.824 --> 12:09.794
with great fanfare from
the University of Chicago,

12:09.795 --> 12:12.830
lured here by none other than the esteemed

12:12.831 --> 12:16.050
Jacob Schiff of Kuhn & Loeb,

12:16.051 --> 12:18.586
to continue his
groundbreaking surgical work

12:18.587 --> 12:21.088
at Mount Sinai Jews' Hospital,

12:21.089 --> 12:23.140
Dr. Levi Zinberg.

12:34.019 --> 12:36.153
I'm always nervous when it's mentioned

12:36.154 --> 12:40.157
that I was persuaded to
come to New York by a banker.

12:41.993 --> 12:44.662
Even my 10-year-old son
asked if I was brought here

12:44.663 --> 12:47.915
to surgically remove people's
wallets from their pockets.

12:52.370 --> 12:56.322
Cutting people open is what we surgeons do.

12:57.175 --> 12:59.927
But often, we haven't any idea

12:59.928 --> 13:04.131
if the site of the incision
is even remotely correct.

13:04.132 --> 13:06.433
The stone we are seeking

13:06.434 --> 13:10.053
may be nowhere near our first cut.

13:11.807 --> 13:14.809
We might believe there
is esophageal trouble,

13:14.810 --> 13:18.145
but until we lay the
patient open and invade him,

13:18.146 --> 13:22.515
well, we have no idea if we are correct.

13:23.902 --> 13:26.287
Pain and suffering

13:26.288 --> 13:31.125
caused by our indiscriminate
scalpels is great indeed.

13:31.126 --> 13:35.361
And I have endeavored to change that...

13:36.414 --> 13:37.947
with this.

13:40.585 --> 13:42.837
This...

13:42.838 --> 13:46.789
is the Illuminating Intrascope.

13:48.593 --> 13:51.562
Now, you may wonder why
I didn't name my invention

13:51.563 --> 13:53.731
after myself as so many other surgeons do.

13:53.732 --> 13:59.486
But the reality is that
anything named after a Zinberg

13:59.487 --> 14:01.605
will always be at the end of the book.

14:04.693 --> 14:06.777
With this device,

14:06.778 --> 14:09.280
I can make a small incision,

14:09.281 --> 14:11.832
place the Intrascope into the wound,

14:11.833 --> 14:15.703
turn on its built-in light source,

14:15.704 --> 14:20.206
and actually see inside the human body.

14:21.343 --> 14:24.428
If the patient is sufficiently
relaxed with opium,

14:24.429 --> 14:27.131
the Intrascope can be placed
down a patient's throat

14:27.132 --> 14:30.684
to observe the esophagus or larynx.

14:30.685 --> 14:33.637
Through an incision, it could
be placed near a broken bone

14:33.638 --> 14:36.557
or in the urinary tract.

14:36.558 --> 14:38.758
Or even to probe the intestines.

14:40.562 --> 14:42.311
Gentlemen...

14:44.316 --> 14:47.151
we are healers.

14:47.152 --> 14:50.120
And the fewer incisions we make,

14:50.121 --> 14:52.539
the better our patients will heal.

14:52.540 --> 14:55.409
With my Intrascope,

14:55.410 --> 14:59.413
we can stop being butchers

14:59.414 --> 15:02.466
and start truly being surgeons.

15:35.533 --> 15:37.418
Dr. Thackery.

15:37.419 --> 15:40.587
I'm sorry I wasn't able to introduce
myself before the proceedings began.

15:40.588 --> 15:43.590
Oh, I think you introduced
yourself quite well during them.

15:43.591 --> 15:46.126
Thank you. Levi Zinberg.

15:46.127 --> 15:49.463
And you must either be
Gallinger or Chickering.

15:49.464 --> 15:51.131
By the age, I'd say Gallinger.

15:51.132 --> 15:54.351
- Yes, Everett Gallinger.
- Dr. Chickering Jr.

15:54.352 --> 15:56.937
You've been doing your
homework on the competition.

15:56.938 --> 15:59.556
Nonsense. We're all in this together.

15:59.557 --> 16:02.726
Your team is well-known
throughout the city.

16:02.727 --> 16:05.229
I'm eager to read your hernia paper

16:05.230 --> 16:06.780
and put that discovery into practice.

16:06.781 --> 16:09.233
And I'm eager to own
one of your magic scopes,

16:09.234 --> 16:10.651
as I'm sure everyone here is.

16:10.652 --> 16:14.621
Yes, well, it'll be a while
before we reach that point.

16:14.622 --> 16:16.790
But now that people know of its existence,

16:16.791 --> 16:19.626
I hope others will quickly surpass me.

16:19.627 --> 16:22.746
I've never hoped that in my life.

16:22.747 --> 16:25.215
I am presenting my new previa
procedure at the next meeting.

16:25.216 --> 16:27.051
I see you're also on the list of speakers.

16:27.052 --> 16:29.418
May I ask what it is you'll be presenting?

16:30.755 --> 16:33.340
I'd rather not say.

16:33.341 --> 16:35.625
It was nice meeting you all.

16:38.263 --> 16:40.097
He'd rather not say.

16:40.098 --> 16:42.766
- Can he do that?
- He just did.

16:42.767 --> 16:46.236
I suppose we're not as "all
in this together" as he claims.

16:46.237 --> 16:49.273
The arrogance is astonishing.

16:49.274 --> 16:51.442
Rest assured that this
will be the last time

16:51.443 --> 16:53.110
you were ever outshined by a Jew.

16:53.111 --> 16:54.828
I must be going.

16:54.829 --> 16:57.614
Sister Harriet is meeting me to bring
home a little surprise to Eleanor.

16:57.615 --> 17:00.117
We will drink a toast to your new family.

17:00.118 --> 17:02.002
Cheers. I'm starving.

17:02.003 --> 17:05.039
- Is there no food again?
- Through there.

17:05.040 --> 17:07.823
- Oh, good.
- Scotch.

17:09.127 --> 17:11.127
Thank you.

17:11.128 --> 17:13.797
Dr. Thackery.

17:13.798 --> 17:15.933
Dr. Chickering.

17:15.934 --> 17:17.935
I was hoping for a word.

17:17.935 --> 17:21.021
But by the looks of you, an
examination might be more in order.

17:21.021 --> 17:23.107
Are you unwell? Your color is terrible.

17:23.108 --> 17:25.809
Just a bit too much work.

17:25.810 --> 17:27.810
You wanted to speak
about Bertie, I presume.

17:27.811 --> 17:30.064
About Bertram Jr. Yes.

17:30.065 --> 17:32.950
You wish to commend me for my
excellent mentorship of the young man

17:32.951 --> 17:36.820
and to show your gratitude for
the influence I've had on him.

17:36.821 --> 17:38.822
You have to let him go.

17:38.823 --> 17:41.325
The boy is in your thrall.
It's no good for him.

17:41.326 --> 17:43.293
- You need to send him off.
- To what?

17:43.294 --> 17:45.746
There's nothing out there that
compares to what I'm giving him.

17:45.747 --> 17:48.248
It's what you're taking
from him that is at issue.

17:48.249 --> 17:49.800
He's free to go anytime he wishes.

17:49.801 --> 17:51.969
I hold no special power over him.

17:51.970 --> 17:55.005
You hold enormous power. He worships you.

17:55.006 --> 17:57.508
- And that carnival you run.
- Circus.

17:57.509 --> 18:01.011
Where his former surgical chief put a
gun in his mouth and pulled the trigger.

18:01.012 --> 18:03.379
It was his temple, actually.

18:04.649 --> 18:08.318
It was over a procedure that
your son helped me conquer.

18:08.319 --> 18:11.470
A procedure that will
save thousands of lives.

18:12.574 --> 18:14.024
There are good surgeons everywhere.

18:14.025 --> 18:15.359
Let him learn from one of them.

18:15.360 --> 18:17.861
Good is not enough. Good
does not change the world.

18:17.862 --> 18:19.363
But it can change his life.

18:19.364 --> 18:21.832
He can get married, have a family

18:21.833 --> 18:24.034
and an excellent, lucrative practice

18:24.035 --> 18:25.869
away from the tumult of the Knick.

18:25.870 --> 18:27.838
If the goal is money or ease,

18:27.839 --> 18:29.373
then, yes, I agree with you.

18:29.374 --> 18:33.093
But I assumed our job was
to heal and to save lives.

18:33.094 --> 18:37.548
You are aware how false any
sanctimony is coming from you, correct?

18:37.549 --> 18:39.383
Of course.

18:39.384 --> 18:41.301
Perhaps with a word from both of us,

18:41.302 --> 18:45.888
we could place Bertram with
someone like Dr. Zinberg.

18:48.143 --> 18:50.194
I knew you disliked me,

18:50.195 --> 18:54.064
but until now, I had no idea how much.

18:54.065 --> 18:56.733
You would prefer your son to work

18:56.734 --> 18:59.570
at the Jewish hospital instead of with me?

18:59.571 --> 19:03.189
I would take him working
for the czar over you.

19:04.292 --> 19:06.910
Dr. Chickering, your son is very talented.

19:06.911 --> 19:09.079
I've invested a lot of
time and energy into him,

19:09.080 --> 19:13.167
and I am telling you, he
possesses real greatness.

19:13.168 --> 19:17.337
Whatever you have invested in the boy,

19:17.338 --> 19:21.123
I can assure you, I have infinitely more.

19:22.393 --> 19:24.677
Good afternoon.

19:46.034 --> 19:48.285
Good evening, dear.

19:48.286 --> 19:50.254
I didn't know you were bringing a guest.

19:50.255 --> 19:51.705
I would have tidied up.

19:51.706 --> 19:54.925
That's quite all right.
I won't be staying long.

19:54.926 --> 19:58.128
This is Grace.

19:58.129 --> 20:02.015
She's a healthy six-month-old
baby abandoned at the Knick.

20:02.016 --> 20:03.967
Oh, the poor thing.

20:03.968 --> 20:06.302
Are you out for a walk with her?

20:07.772 --> 20:09.356
No, dear.

20:09.357 --> 20:13.860
Sister Harriet is bringing Grace to us.

20:13.861 --> 20:15.312
To us?

20:15.313 --> 20:17.698
Mmm.

20:17.699 --> 20:19.849
Grace will be our daughter.

20:20.818 --> 20:23.570
Oh, no. I can't.

20:23.571 --> 20:25.739
This could be exactly what we need.

20:25.740 --> 20:28.357
I won't do that to Lillian.

20:30.295 --> 20:32.546
Lillian is gone.

20:32.547 --> 20:35.698
And we can't bring her back.

20:37.885 --> 20:41.170
We must begin to look forward.

20:42.807 --> 20:44.841
Isn't that right, Sister?

20:44.842 --> 20:47.978
God has placed this
child here for a reason.

20:47.979 --> 20:49.680
No, God has cursed us.

20:49.681 --> 20:53.934
We have proven we are
incapable of caring for a child.

20:53.935 --> 20:57.104
And I won't be responsible
for the death of another.

20:57.105 --> 21:01.108
Please, take the baby out
of here before we infect it.

21:01.109 --> 21:03.577
- Eleanor.
- Go!

21:03.578 --> 21:05.028
Now!

21:05.029 --> 21:07.197
Of course. I'm sorry, Mrs. Gallinger.

21:08.700 --> 21:10.816
Harriet.

21:12.370 --> 21:14.037
- Give it to me.
- What are you doing?

21:14.038 --> 21:15.872
Give it to me. Give it to me.

21:15.873 --> 21:19.291
Come here. Come here.

21:24.549 --> 21:26.216
- Look at her.
- Get it away.

21:26.217 --> 21:28.551
- Look at her!
- I can't.

21:31.139 --> 21:33.974
She needs a mother.

21:33.975 --> 21:36.842
Stop, Everett. Please.

21:45.403 --> 21:47.237
Thank you, Jesse, but I'm gonna stay

21:47.238 --> 21:48.989
and work for several more hours.

21:48.990 --> 21:50.657
Of course. I'll be here waiting, then.

21:50.658 --> 21:52.909
No, don't be silly. It might be late.

21:52.910 --> 21:55.495
You should go home and
I'll find my own way back.

21:55.496 --> 21:57.748
Find your own way, ma'am?

21:57.749 --> 22:00.167
I'll be fine here. You take your time.

22:00.168 --> 22:02.219
No, please. I insist.

22:02.220 --> 22:05.389
- You can head back.
- Yes, ma'am.

22:05.390 --> 22:08.624
I'll see you at the house.

22:19.604 --> 22:22.439
Diggs Hotel. 26th and 6th Avenue.

22:22.440 --> 22:25.776
I'm not sure a woman like you should
have any business in a place like that.

22:25.777 --> 22:28.695
And I'm quite sure you have
no business questioning me.

22:28.696 --> 22:30.613
Now, please.

22:41.793 --> 22:43.460
I said, you know,

22:43.461 --> 22:45.642
"You're gonna have to
pay that rent for us."

22:45.643 --> 22:47.413
You know where she is?

23:09.987 --> 23:13.740
You seem to be working late
a lot these past few weeks.

23:13.741 --> 23:15.826
When I'm not out of the house for evenings

23:15.827 --> 23:19.629
at the opera, the ballet, and apparently,

23:19.630 --> 23:23.049
even a symposium at the Natural
History Museum on dinosaur bones,

23:23.050 --> 23:25.502
which I'm sure would have been fascinating.

23:27.221 --> 23:30.390
It's impossible to keep you at
home at night at all anymore.

23:30.391 --> 23:32.759
I just can't help myself.

23:32.760 --> 23:34.561
I yearn for culture

23:34.562 --> 23:37.230
and thirst for entertainment.

23:37.231 --> 23:39.232
You seem very passionate about it.

23:39.233 --> 23:42.051
I am.

23:44.071 --> 23:45.605
I hope I can continue to keep

23:45.606 --> 23:48.191
your curiosities satisfied.

23:48.192 --> 23:50.694
Based on experience,

23:50.695 --> 23:53.395
I have no doubt you will.

23:55.583 --> 23:58.484
Aren't you scared of what we're doing?

23:59.871 --> 24:02.955
I'm only scared we won't be able to stop.

24:44.415 --> 24:48.117
Could you, uh, pass that vial, please?

24:51.339 --> 24:54.591
Are we gonna do it again?

24:54.592 --> 24:56.426
So soon?

24:56.427 --> 25:00.546
No, I have some work to do downstairs.

25:26.123 --> 25:27.791
You're shaking.

25:27.792 --> 25:29.792
Let me do it.

25:30.595 --> 25:32.327
Thank you.

25:54.535 --> 25:56.518
May I come in?

25:59.240 --> 26:01.523
I couldn't sleep.

26:08.466 --> 26:11.166
Would you like me to make you a cup of tea?

26:14.889 --> 26:17.039
- John?
- What?

26:18.559 --> 26:20.760
I just thought you might like a cup of tea.

26:20.761 --> 26:23.345
No, thank you.

26:29.687 --> 26:32.054
Will you please put that back?

26:40.197 --> 26:42.032
I think I'll go home.

26:42.033 --> 26:43.899
Fine.

27:23.574 --> 27:25.625
You're in early this morning.

27:25.626 --> 27:27.243
I couldn't sleep.

27:27.244 --> 27:29.079
I'm sorry to hear that.

27:29.080 --> 27:30.880
What kept you up?

27:30.881 --> 27:32.865
Maybe I can help.

27:34.635 --> 27:37.202
It's nothing you need to worry about.

27:38.255 --> 27:39.973
You're right, I don't
need to worry about it,

27:39.974 --> 27:42.258
but that doesn't prevent me from

27:42.259 --> 27:45.093
worrying about it, however.

27:47.264 --> 27:50.354
Bertie, could you come
and see me in my office?

27:50.355 --> 27:51.401
Of course.

27:51.402 --> 27:54.988
- Morning, Nurse Elkins.
- Good morning, Doctor.

27:54.989 --> 27:58.807
I'll write you a prescription
for a large, hot cup of coffee.

28:00.111 --> 28:01.977
You're very sweet.

28:11.505 --> 28:14.823
You look worse this morning
than you did at the conference.

28:16.711 --> 28:19.963
I might have a touch of something.

28:19.964 --> 28:23.299
I, uh... I've reworked our previa papers.

28:23.300 --> 28:24.934
I thought you were happy with it.

28:24.935 --> 28:27.387
I was until I saw what Zinberg presented.

28:27.388 --> 28:29.105
We can't be outdone by him.

28:29.106 --> 28:32.809
We are at the forefront
of discovery and technique.

28:32.810 --> 28:34.394
Everything we do.

28:34.395 --> 28:37.614
Everything, even the words we put on paper

28:37.615 --> 28:41.183
must be above and beyond expectation.

28:42.703 --> 28:45.103
This is gonna make you, Bertie.

28:46.540 --> 28:49.659
Now, your father

28:49.660 --> 28:52.328
will have a hard time arguing with that.

28:52.329 --> 28:53.963
Yes, he will.

28:53.964 --> 28:56.049
Is this the final draft before we print?

28:56.050 --> 28:58.668
Well, I don't see how we
can make that any better.

28:58.669 --> 29:02.172
I'm due back on the ward.

29:02.173 --> 29:04.840
Just take your time.

29:12.983 --> 29:16.352
Now, the Roosevelts' hospital's

29:16.353 --> 29:18.738
got their hands on some of the drug.

29:18.739 --> 29:21.858
But the Hospital for the
Ruptured and Crippled does, too,

29:21.859 --> 29:24.577
thanks to Mr. Frick.

29:24.578 --> 29:26.780
I wanted to give you the opportunity

29:26.781 --> 29:28.697
to do the same for us.

29:29.950 --> 29:31.534
It seems I've had more

29:31.535 --> 29:34.754
than my fair share of
opportunities recently.

29:34.755 --> 29:38.208
The electrification,
the new X-ray machine,

29:38.209 --> 29:42.462
covering the cost of cleaning
up after the recent riots.

29:42.463 --> 29:45.298
For which we are eternally grateful.

29:45.299 --> 29:48.384
It's not writing a check that irks me.

29:48.385 --> 29:51.554
It's the unceasing assumption

29:51.555 --> 29:53.306
that I always will.

29:53.307 --> 29:56.359
I have done more than
my fair share recently

29:56.360 --> 29:59.279
and you have come back to
the well one too many times,

29:59.280 --> 30:01.897
Mr. Barrow.

30:06.036 --> 30:09.823
If I seem presumptuous,

30:09.824 --> 30:13.576
it is only because I have never met a man

30:13.577 --> 30:15.411
who's shown greater generosity

30:15.412 --> 30:17.080
than you have toward us.

30:17.081 --> 30:20.250
And I will again, but
today is not that day.

30:20.251 --> 30:22.868
Those ships that are going down...

30:23.587 --> 30:25.787
those are my ships.

30:26.507 --> 30:27.924
That's my cargo.

30:27.925 --> 30:29.809
Those are my customers who are demanding

30:29.810 --> 30:31.594
I pay them for their losses.

30:31.595 --> 30:33.646
Two ships at the bottom of the sea already,

30:33.647 --> 30:36.850
another limping to the dock in Saipan.

30:36.851 --> 30:39.936
I am supposed to be making money

30:39.937 --> 30:42.604
on this war, not losing it.

30:43.440 --> 30:46.108
That's terrible, sir.

30:47.027 --> 30:50.613
And I understand that the well is dry...

30:50.614 --> 30:52.115
The well is far from dry.

30:52.116 --> 30:53.533
It's simply you're the man with the bucket

30:53.534 --> 30:57.986
about whom I am least concerned right now.

30:59.089 --> 31:01.674
It is only a few thousand dollars.

31:01.675 --> 31:05.577
Then you should have no
trouble finding it elsewhere.

31:06.964 --> 31:09.799
Mr. Tuttle, age 52.

31:09.800 --> 31:12.969
No alcoholism or syphilis.

31:12.970 --> 31:15.805
Swelling in his right jaw began
approximately five weeks ago.

31:15.806 --> 31:19.275
And just prior to that, Mr.
Tuttle had two teeth extracted.

31:19.276 --> 31:20.977
And you believe they're linked.

31:20.978 --> 31:22.478
It would appear so.

31:22.479 --> 31:24.948
Swelling in the jaw has increased slowly

31:24.949 --> 31:27.317
and if you feel the location,

31:27.318 --> 31:29.518
the edges are quite hard.

31:32.039 --> 31:34.489
Here's an X-ray of the jaw.

31:36.076 --> 31:37.961
Conclusion?

31:37.962 --> 31:39.329
Actinomycosis.

31:39.330 --> 31:42.048
Not uncommon in the wake of dental surgery.

31:42.049 --> 31:44.467
- Treatment so far?
- Iodide of potassium.

31:44.468 --> 31:46.302
90 grains three times a day for two weeks.

31:46.303 --> 31:48.671
I think it's time we go
in and remove the mass.

31:48.672 --> 31:51.841
Will someone please shut that man up?

31:53.477 --> 31:55.511
You were saying?

31:55.512 --> 31:57.347
I believe it's too soon to operate.

31:57.348 --> 32:00.733
I'd agree if there had
been any improvements.

32:00.734 --> 32:03.937
But quite to the contrary, Mr. Tuttle's
mass seems to have grown larger.

32:03.938 --> 32:05.939
Well, let's prepare him for surgery.

32:05.940 --> 32:08.358
Both of you assisting.

32:08.359 --> 32:11.828
- Are you feeling all right?
- I'm fine!

32:11.829 --> 32:14.998
Now if everyone would
just stop asking me that

32:14.999 --> 32:19.534
and just take care of the
people here who are actually ill.

32:26.844 --> 32:30.096
I'm sorry about that, Mr. Tuttle,

32:30.097 --> 32:32.215
and promise we will take
excellent care of you.

32:32.216 --> 32:34.717
He... he's brusque,

32:34.718 --> 32:36.602
but he's a fine surgeon.

32:36.603 --> 32:38.438
As long as it isn't you doing it,

32:38.439 --> 32:40.807
he can yell all he wants.

32:40.808 --> 32:43.192
You do such a wonderful job

32:43.193 --> 32:46.479
aiding Sister Harriet with
her work for the children

32:46.480 --> 32:48.031
of this blighted city.

32:48.032 --> 32:52.735
But you can understand that
the rest of our hospital

32:52.736 --> 32:55.071
is in need of the Lord's help as well.

32:55.072 --> 32:56.739
Of course, Mr. Barrow.

32:56.740 --> 32:59.409
Our concern is always for everyone in need.

32:59.410 --> 33:03.246
We treat so many of your people.

33:03.247 --> 33:04.964
Italians.

33:04.965 --> 33:07.884
Spanish. Polacks.

33:07.885 --> 33:10.553
And the Irish.

33:10.554 --> 33:12.255
Regardless of the cost,

33:12.256 --> 33:14.724
we would never turn them away.

33:14.725 --> 33:16.893
It's a godly thing you're doing.

33:16.894 --> 33:20.378
I feel it every day, Archbishop.

33:22.066 --> 33:23.933
But now...

33:23.934 --> 33:27.236
we need supplies in a hurry

33:27.237 --> 33:29.739
and we just don't have the funds.

33:29.740 --> 33:32.442
Well, with half million wretched immigrants

33:32.443 --> 33:34.077
coming into this city each year,

33:34.078 --> 33:35.495
the pinch is on everywhere.

33:35.496 --> 33:38.998
It's a bind we understand completely.

33:38.999 --> 33:40.666
I knew you would.

33:40.667 --> 33:44.203
We fund so many Catholic
hospitals of our own,

33:44.204 --> 33:47.290
do work in the poor
neighborhoods with the immigrants,

33:47.291 --> 33:49.792
that the drain is enormous.

33:49.793 --> 33:53.495
So much so that we really
have nothing left to give.

33:54.214 --> 33:55.681
I'm sorry, Mr. Barrow,

33:55.682 --> 33:58.500
the Church can't spare another penny.

33:59.436 --> 34:01.586
More tea?

34:03.057 --> 34:05.475
No.

34:05.476 --> 34:07.309
Thank you.

34:08.946 --> 34:11.364
Surely Dr. Thackery or Dr. Gallinger

34:11.364 --> 34:13.282
could have come to the
hearing in your place.

34:14.650 --> 34:16.819
I did many of the tests
involved with Miss Mallon,

34:16.820 --> 34:19.739
so Thack thought... well, Dr. Thackery

34:19.739 --> 34:23.493
thought I should be the one
to represent the hospital.

34:23.494 --> 34:26.379
He's giving me more
and more responsibility.

34:26.380 --> 34:29.382
How is the previa paper coming?

34:29.382 --> 34:32.385
Still being worked on.

34:32.386 --> 34:36.139
Bertram, I'd like you
to reconsider my offer.

34:36.139 --> 34:38.424
You can join my practice
and I can guarantee you

34:38.425 --> 34:41.177
an excellent starting salary.

34:41.178 --> 34:43.312
Father, I don't want to be disrespectful...

34:43.313 --> 34:45.063
Well, if not me, then
what about Dr. Zinberg?

34:45.065 --> 34:46.232
He said he'd meet with you.

34:46.233 --> 34:49.018
He's a fine man at a very good hospital.

34:49.018 --> 34:51.603
Well, I already have
all of that at the Knick.

34:51.605 --> 34:53.188
And there's something else there

34:53.190 --> 34:57.193
that would make for a very rewarding life.

34:57.194 --> 34:59.445
I'm in love with a girl there.

34:59.446 --> 35:00.947
Really?

35:00.948 --> 35:04.083
- Nurse Lucy Elkins.
- A nurse.

35:04.084 --> 35:07.453
Yes, we've been out several times.

35:07.454 --> 35:11.457
She understands the life of a
physician better than anyone.

35:11.458 --> 35:13.676
In love.

35:13.677 --> 35:15.511
Bertram, that is wonderful to hear.

35:15.512 --> 35:17.880
I look forward to meeting the girl.

35:17.881 --> 35:21.217
But if you wed, she won't
be a nurse much longer,

35:21.218 --> 35:23.436
so you won't be able
to use her as an excuse

35:23.437 --> 35:24.887
to keep you tethered to the Knick.

35:24.888 --> 35:28.340
My offer will be difficult to refuse.

35:29.393 --> 35:31.760
I should head inside now.

35:35.482 --> 35:38.451
Miss Mallon has committed no crime.

35:38.452 --> 35:42.405
She's been tried in no court

35:42.406 --> 35:45.774
and has had no due process under the law.

35:47.127 --> 35:48.744
On the word of a few crusaders,

35:48.745 --> 35:51.214
she's been shut up in
quarantine in a tiny cabin

35:51.215 --> 35:54.000
on North Brother Island against her will

35:54.001 --> 35:57.253
with the sick and the
dying and the diseased,

35:57.254 --> 35:59.838
of which she's none of those things.

36:01.391 --> 36:04.644
She wants her freedom.

36:04.645 --> 36:07.796
And I'm here to make
certain that she gets it.

36:08.932 --> 36:11.800
Miss Mallon, would you
take the stand, please?

36:16.073 --> 36:18.324
Place your hand here, please.

36:18.325 --> 36:20.743
Do you swear to tell the
truth, the whole truth,

36:20.744 --> 36:22.945
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

36:22.946 --> 36:23.776
I do.

36:23.777 --> 36:26.199
I'd toss out that Bible if I were you.

36:26.200 --> 36:29.701
- Your Honor.
- Inspector Speight, please.

36:33.040 --> 36:34.957
Miss Mallon, can you tell me

36:34.958 --> 36:36.959
how you came to be at this hearing today?

36:36.960 --> 36:38.878
I was kidnapped.

36:38.879 --> 36:41.631
Not for ransom, but I was attacked.

36:41.632 --> 36:45.101
Taken from me job and shut
away by these awful people

36:45.102 --> 36:46.936
who think I'm some sort of monster.

36:46.937 --> 36:49.889
A devil. Those people.

36:49.890 --> 36:52.642
Maligning me in the papers.

36:52.643 --> 36:54.694
Calling me Typhoid Mary.

36:54.695 --> 36:58.179
I didn't get no one sick
'cause I was never sick meself.

36:59.900 --> 37:02.368
Me lawyer, Mr. Bakerman,

37:02.369 --> 37:05.655
told me all about that habeas
corpus you got in the law.

37:05.656 --> 37:07.323
Produce a body, that says.

37:07.324 --> 37:10.159
Well, here's me body.

37:10.160 --> 37:13.579
And it's not got any disease.
I've never felt better.

37:13.580 --> 37:15.665
Look at me. I'm in the pink.

37:15.666 --> 37:19.001
No cough, no cold, no fever.

37:19.002 --> 37:21.619
Sick people get sick.

37:22.339 --> 37:24.372
Do I look sick to you?

37:25.342 --> 37:27.792
Not a bit, Miss Mallon.

37:39.906 --> 37:42.724
Hey, excuse me. Hey.

37:46.029 --> 37:48.480
Two of you are fired.

37:49.866 --> 37:51.983
Well, which two?

37:54.538 --> 37:57.340
You for insubordination.

37:57.341 --> 38:00.209
And you for being drunk on the job.

38:00.210 --> 38:02.628
So don't expect to be paid for the week.

38:02.629 --> 38:05.413
We run a respectable business.

38:06.350 --> 38:08.249
Thank you very much.

38:25.619 --> 38:27.820
Your Honor, simply because Miss Mallon

38:27.821 --> 38:29.405
isn't showing signs of the disease,

38:29.406 --> 38:31.540
it doesn't mean that she doesn't have it

38:31.541 --> 38:33.793
or that she can't give it to other people.

38:33.794 --> 38:35.711
Her presence in all of
the homes and businesses

38:35.712 --> 38:38.080
where the health inspector
found out that she had worked

38:38.081 --> 38:41.133
produced at least 18 cases of typhoid fever

38:41.134 --> 38:42.885
and several verified deaths.

38:42.886 --> 38:46.639
- That's hogwash.
- Miss Mallon.

38:46.640 --> 38:49.642
Dr. Chickering, how many
other documented cases

38:49.643 --> 38:52.710
like Miss Mallon's with no symptoms?

38:54.014 --> 38:56.766
Admittedly, Miss Mallon is
the first asymptomatic case

38:56.767 --> 38:58.434
of a disease we've ever found.

38:58.435 --> 39:02.271
We were previously unaware that
something like this could exist.

39:02.272 --> 39:04.857
But, Your Honor, you must understand

39:04.858 --> 39:06.942
that even though Miss Mallon feels fine,

39:06.943 --> 39:09.745
she still carries the
disease for others to catch.

39:09.746 --> 39:13.199
Her bowel movements contained a
pure culture of bacillus typhi.

39:13.200 --> 39:15.534
She has the disease.

39:15.535 --> 39:17.819
How many tests were done?

39:19.005 --> 39:21.207
She has had one a week
for the last four months,

39:21.208 --> 39:22.458
so that's 16 in total.

39:22.459 --> 39:24.210
You should ask him how many of those tests

39:24.211 --> 39:26.011
didn't have the disease in them.

39:26.012 --> 39:28.713
Miss Mallon, please.

39:30.517 --> 39:32.268
How many, Dr. Chickering?

39:32.269 --> 39:34.303
There were five instances where the disease

39:34.304 --> 39:36.722
was not found in a sample.

39:36.723 --> 39:39.475
Well, it makes one
wonder if it is your test

39:39.476 --> 39:41.777
that might be ill and not Miss Mallon.

39:41.778 --> 39:43.896
Though the fact that she has
been on North Brother Island

39:43.897 --> 39:47.032
in close contact with so many
other patients with typhoid fever

39:47.033 --> 39:51.320
and her health hasn't changed is more proof
for the fact that she has the disease,

39:51.321 --> 39:53.489
but is impervious to its symptoms.

39:53.490 --> 39:56.292
Perhaps it's proof of the opposite.

39:56.293 --> 39:57.710
Perhaps Miss Mallon

39:57.711 --> 40:01.747
is as healthy as a horse and simply immune.

40:01.748 --> 40:04.383
And perhaps if you had gone to
medical school instead of law school,

40:04.384 --> 40:07.001
you would have some idea of
what you were talking about.

40:08.004 --> 40:11.089
You can step down now, Doctor.

40:12.759 --> 40:15.094
It's times like this I wish I drank.

40:15.095 --> 40:17.847
I'm sorry I lost my composure.

40:17.848 --> 40:21.684
- It's not why we lost.
- The man is a fool.

40:21.685 --> 40:23.736
It took 5,000 years
for people to understand

40:23.737 --> 40:25.905
that germs can make a body sick.

40:25.906 --> 40:27.606
It's gonna take some time
for them to figure out

40:27.607 --> 40:29.158
that they can exist and not.

40:29.159 --> 40:31.809
Sweet freedom!

40:33.280 --> 40:36.198
- Go fuck yourselves.
- Go wash yourself.

40:36.199 --> 40:39.084
At least your fucking hand and
your fetid ass when you take a shit

40:39.085 --> 40:41.986
so you don't kill someone
with your shit-filled cooking!

40:45.175 --> 40:46.625
My apologies, Miss Robertson.

40:46.626 --> 40:49.178
Don't apologize to me.
She's the filthy gash.

41:35.141 --> 41:39.260
The gallery should take
note that the abscess...

41:40.647 --> 41:43.516
is located...

41:43.517 --> 41:46.350
near the mental foramen.

41:47.737 --> 41:52.807
I am going to curette the area...

41:55.161 --> 41:57.478
and possibly...

41:59.282 --> 42:02.483
remove some bone from the jaw.

42:07.123 --> 42:09.508
There's quite a bit of pus in there.

42:09.509 --> 42:14.046
This tissue is hard as gristle.

42:14.047 --> 42:16.715
Perhaps it makes more
sense to cut posteriorly...

42:16.716 --> 42:18.800
No, this is fine.

42:31.648 --> 42:36.184
It is critical not to puncture
the mass during the removal.

42:37.787 --> 42:39.821
If the...

42:41.157 --> 42:44.043
if the... what is it?

42:44.044 --> 42:47.862
- It's the ray fungus.
- The ray fungus...

42:49.332 --> 42:51.833
is allowed to escape...

42:54.004 --> 42:56.839
Thack, you all right?

42:56.840 --> 42:59.040
Do you need assistance?

43:02.979 --> 43:06.714
I, uh... I have a bit of a headache.

43:07.767 --> 43:09.884
Will you excuse me?

43:14.190 --> 43:16.075
Where are you going?

43:16.076 --> 43:18.694
Dowell's needle and silk.

43:18.695 --> 43:20.579
Nurse Elkins.

43:20.580 --> 43:23.866
Nurse Elkins, Dowell's
needle and silk, please.

43:23.867 --> 43:26.368
Quickly, thank you.

43:31.091 --> 43:32.907
Hello?

43:39.849 --> 43:42.967
Eleanor?

43:46.690 --> 43:49.058
- What are you doing?
- It's cold.

43:49.059 --> 43:51.342
I'm knitting a hat for Lillian.

43:58.234 --> 44:00.035
Grace hasn't been changed all day.

44:00.036 --> 44:02.019
Who hasn't?

44:08.995 --> 44:10.913
Shh, shh, shh.

44:15.752 --> 44:17.503
Do you have references?

44:17.504 --> 44:19.620
Oh, I certainly do, yes.

44:23.893 --> 44:26.261
Is this your married
name on your application?

44:26.262 --> 44:28.397
Yes, it's right there. Corinne LaMere.

44:28.398 --> 44:31.266
Well, as long as it's not
"LaMary," you should be fine.

44:31.267 --> 44:32.818
I don't understand, ma'am.

44:32.819 --> 44:34.436
Oh, I'm sorry.

44:34.437 --> 44:36.438
There was an outbreak, a woman named Mary.

44:36.439 --> 44:40.025
- It was in all the papers.
- Oh, I don't read the papers, ma'am.

44:40.026 --> 44:42.444
Do you think you'll be able
to place me somewhere soon?

44:42.445 --> 44:44.496
I miss the kitchen and I could use a wage.

44:44.497 --> 44:47.064
I'm sure I'll have no problem
finding you something good.

45:25.121 --> 45:28.656
I will add this to your bill.

45:29.709 --> 45:32.628
If I'd have known you were gonna charge me,

45:32.629 --> 45:36.165
I would have gone back to
sleep and let you choke.

45:36.166 --> 45:38.383
I would not have died.

45:38.384 --> 45:40.886
Nothing can kill me.

45:40.887 --> 45:43.087
Of course not.

45:47.060 --> 45:49.460
You're healing nicely.

45:50.847 --> 45:54.516
I will not forget what you did for me.

45:54.517 --> 45:58.936
You will always have a friend in Wu.

46:09.032 --> 46:12.233
- I pack you a bowl, honey?
- Three.

46:13.670 --> 46:15.871
Price is a lot now.

46:15.872 --> 46:18.874
Wu making everyone pay first now,

46:18.875 --> 46:20.876
even you.

46:20.877 --> 46:23.679
No more opium from China.

46:23.680 --> 46:26.014
- Lots of problems.
- But you have it?

46:26.015 --> 46:28.884
Yes, still have.

46:28.885 --> 46:31.386
- I lie with you, too?
- No.

46:31.387 --> 46:34.723
I want to go out and stay out.

46:34.724 --> 46:36.608
If I wake up,

46:36.609 --> 46:38.393
you shove this pipe in my mouth

46:38.394 --> 46:43.398
and you fire it up again
and again and again.

46:43.399 --> 46:47.351
You do want to wake up
sometime, right, Johnny?
