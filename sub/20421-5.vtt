00:02.500 --> 00:04.970
<b>Hey! 
What are you looking for today?</b>

00:03.570 --> 00:04.980
<i>Non-player characters...</i>

00:05.680 --> 00:08.980
<b>Clerk 
Hey!</b>

00:05.730 --> 00:08.500
<i>People in the game that aren't players.</i>

00:07.230 --> 00:08.970
<b>Clerk 
What are you 
looking for today?</b>

00:09.610 --> 00:12.070
<i>They say only predetermined lines,</i>

00:09.710 --> 00:12.450
<b>Welcome to the village of Arb.</b>

00:12.070 --> 00:13.800
<i>have no personalities,</i>

00:12.090 --> 00:14.660
<b>Where's the inn?</b>

00:13.320 --> 00:15.240
<b>Welcome to the village of Arb.</b>

00:13.800 --> 00:17.100
<i>and exist merely to fulfill their game roles.</i>

00:14.660 --> 00:17.200
<b>Hey! 
You're totally hot! 
I'm in love with you!</b>

00:16.280 --> 00:17.990
<b>Welcome to the village of Arb.</b>

00:18.280 --> 00:22.460
<i>In</i> Elder Tale, <i>players are called adventurers,</i>

00:23.020 --> 00:25.750
<i>and NPCs are known as People of the Land.</i>

00:26.560 --> 00:31.470
<i>But after the Apocalypse, something changed.</i>

02:05.090 --> 02:07.770
Serara, you're okay, right?

02:07.770 --> 02:09.680
I'm so glad...

02:09.680 --> 02:11.440
I'm really relieved.

02:11.440 --> 02:14.510
Yes, I'm sorry I worried you.

02:14.510 --> 02:15.930
Goodbye.

02:16.920 --> 02:20.560
I really am safe now, aren't I?

02:20.560 --> 02:23.370
We went over the Lyport Channel.

02:23.370 --> 02:25.870
They don't have griffons.

02:26.200 --> 02:29.370
We'll be fine now.

02:33.130 --> 02:36.200
Now that I'm safe, I just feel kind of...

02:37.300 --> 02:41.720
Thank you, everyone!

02:44.220 --> 02:46.850
Now that she feels safe, you feel hungry!

02:46.850 --> 02:50.200
D-Don't blame it on someone else, stupid Naotsugu!

02:50.200 --> 02:51.510
I'm hungry, too.

02:52.900 --> 02:58.860
<b>Return to Akihabara</b>

02:55.390 --> 02:57.390
Return to Akihabara.

03:00.740 --> 03:04.060
So we're supposed to set these up ourselves?

03:04.060 --> 03:06.570
Naotsugu, spread out the ground sheet.

03:06.710 --> 03:10.390
Uh, Shiro, since when have you been into camping?

03:10.390 --> 03:12.630
I once read about it in a book.

03:13.440 --> 03:18.180
Though I'm sure in the real world, 
it wouldn't be this easy...

03:18.180 --> 03:22.630
You never know what'll come 
in handy in this world.

03:26.590 --> 03:28.020
A wild deer?

03:28.630 --> 03:32.020
So there are animals that aren't monsters?

03:32.020 --> 03:35.610
This is my time to shine.

03:38.800 --> 03:40.400
All right!

03:40.640 --> 03:42.540
We have a place to sleep!

03:42.540 --> 03:47.050
If this were the game, we'd only 
need to log out and go to bed.

03:47.050 --> 03:50.410
Since we're here, we might as well 
have fun doing it the hard way.

03:50.720 --> 03:51.920
But...

03:53.840 --> 03:56.350
Our food...

03:56.350 --> 03:58.920
It looks so yummy...

03:58.920 --> 04:01.820
But it doesn't taste like anything.

04:01.820 --> 04:04.230
Serara and Nyanta are late.

04:05.610 --> 04:07.110
Something smells!

04:07.110 --> 04:08.870
What's gotten into you?

04:09.450 --> 04:10.600
What's this?

04:11.170 --> 04:13.600
The smell of cooked meat?

04:17.640 --> 04:21.730
Looks like our hungry campers could smell the food cooking.

04:21.730 --> 04:25.860
But I don't know about tasteless meat, 
even if it does smell good.

04:30.450 --> 04:32.480
Yum!

04:32.480 --> 04:35.540
This is... I can't describe it! Amazing!

04:35.950 --> 04:37.690
The texture when you bite into it...

04:37.690 --> 04:39.250
The delicious juices...

04:39.250 --> 04:41.720
The sweetness of the fat!

04:41.720 --> 04:46.220
Just the right amount of salt, 
with rosemary for a secret ingredient...

04:47.090 --> 04:48.720
This is, without a doubt...

04:49.470 --> 04:51.290
The taste of real food!

04:51.290 --> 04:52.360
Meow.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.520
You're amazing, Chief! More!

04:55.520 --> 04:56.440
Now, now...

04:56.440 --> 04:59.690
Don't be in such a rush. There's plenty.

05:00.250 --> 05:02.440
But how...

05:03.650 --> 05:04.960
Meow.

05:04.960 --> 05:08.910
Prepare the ingredients, and pick the 
item you want from the menu.

05:08.910 --> 05:14.340
And it will make you a food item that 
looks just like the real thing.

05:14.340 --> 05:17.080
Yes, exactly like the game.

05:17.080 --> 05:18.880
But it doesn't taste like anything.

05:18.880 --> 05:21.910
Get away from thinking of this 
in terms of a game.

05:21.910 --> 05:27.500
Ingredient items like fruits and vegetables 
taste like the real things, right?

05:28.770 --> 05:32.840
So just do what I've done here...

05:32.840 --> 05:35.940
Don't make it from the menu.

05:35.940 --> 05:41.470
Prepare and cook the ingredients 
with your own hands.

05:42.580 --> 05:44.840
We tried that, as well.

05:44.840 --> 05:46.700
But look...

05:48.770 --> 05:50.380
Just look at it!

05:50.380 --> 05:53.250
Try to boil it, and it becomes a weird paste.

05:53.250 --> 05:55.580
No matter what we did, 
none of us could make anything.

05:56.120 --> 05:59.080
So we thought that was the rule in this world.

05:59.590 --> 06:02.520
That happened because the person 
who made it wasn't a chef,

06:02.520 --> 06:07.640
or didn't have the requisite cooking level.

06:07.640 --> 06:08.840
Which means...

06:08.840 --> 06:10.400
That's correct.

06:10.400 --> 06:13.500
My subclass is chef.

06:10.570 --> 06:14.090
<b>Nyanta 
Race/ Cat-man 
Swashbuckler, Lv. 90 
Subclass 
Chef Lv. 90</b>

06:14.740 --> 06:16.100
I see...

06:16.100 --> 06:20.070
Then to make it for real, someone with 
the appropriate skill must do it?

06:20.590 --> 06:21.790
<i>He's right.</i>

06:21.790 --> 06:24.110
<i>Until now, I've been thinking 
of things in game terms.</i>

06:25.120 --> 06:26.570
<i>Which means...</i>

06:28.510 --> 06:29.840
Master Nyanta...

06:29.840 --> 06:31.070
M-Master?

06:31.070 --> 06:33.350
Allow me to introduce myself properly.

06:33.350 --> 06:34.820
My name is Akatsuki.

06:34.820 --> 06:36.230
My class is Assassin.

06:36.230 --> 06:37.460
I'm level 90.

06:37.460 --> 06:40.440
You were splendid back there.

06:40.440 --> 06:41.690
Not at all.

06:41.690 --> 06:44.310
I was impressed by the way you fought.

06:44.310 --> 06:45.370
What?

06:45.370 --> 06:47.470
That isn't how you acted toward me...

06:47.850 --> 06:49.550
Of course not, Morontsugu.

06:49.550 --> 06:50.470
Don't shorten it!

06:50.800 --> 06:52.390
Then, Talltsugu.

06:52.390 --> 06:53.820
That isn't better.

06:54.300 --> 06:57.100
I see you have good companions, Shiroe.

06:57.640 --> 06:59.250
You, too, Serara...

06:59.250 --> 07:00.350
Ah, right.

07:00.850 --> 07:03.360
I apologize for not properly introducing myself.

07:03.820 --> 07:06.650
I'm Serara, with the Crescent Moon Alliance.

07:06.650 --> 07:10.520
I'm still a novice druid, at level 19.

07:10.520 --> 07:12.630
My subclass is maid.

07:12.630 --> 07:14.180
A-And...

07:14.180 --> 07:19.240
I'm sorry for the trouble I caused 
with my poor healing skills!

07:19.240 --> 07:21.620
It was more than enough.

07:22.250 --> 07:24.250
Thank you.

07:24.250 --> 07:26.640
And, Shiroe, thank you...

07:27.790 --> 07:30.970
Thank you so much!

07:30.970 --> 07:35.180
Uh, no... I didn't do anything special.

07:36.540 --> 07:39.930
Shiroe's always been easily embarrassed.

07:40.370 --> 07:42.500
Let me guess, Serara.

07:42.500 --> 07:45.410
You've always been told you're 
the third cutest in class,

07:45.410 --> 07:48.600
but you get more love letters than anyone!

07:48.600 --> 07:49.940
H-Huh?

07:52.760 --> 07:56.070
My lord, I kneed that rude man in the face.

07:56.070 --> 07:59.000
Enough with the knees, and enough 
after-action reports!

07:59.000 --> 08:01.290
While I was at it, I confiscated his meat.

08:05.320 --> 08:06.890
I can't move...

08:06.890 --> 08:08.810
You ate too much, Pigtsugu.

08:08.810 --> 08:11.980
So you two have known each other a long time.

08:11.980 --> 08:13.510
Right, Nyanta and Shiroe?

08:13.510 --> 08:15.800
Naotsugu, too.

08:15.800 --> 08:20.390
When this was a game, 
we were all in the same group.

08:21.100 --> 08:25.150
It was called the Debauchery Tea Party.

08:25.980 --> 08:27.560
That's right...

08:27.560 --> 08:33.490
I heard about a legendary party that 
completed many difficult quests.

08:33.490 --> 08:36.690
That was my lord and Master Nyanta?

08:36.690 --> 08:38.540
And me, too!

08:38.810 --> 08:42.210
Then you were all in the same guild?

08:42.210 --> 08:46.100
It wasn't a guild. More like a hangout.

08:47.200 --> 08:50.310
Each of us was in a different guild, 
and was quite different than the others.

08:50.310 --> 08:52.620
We had nothing in common.

08:52.620 --> 08:57.440
We just happened to enjoy adventuring together.

08:59.910 --> 09:01.560
<i>That explains it...</i>

09:02.240 --> 09:05.400
<i>How my master and his friends have griffons,</i>

09:05.400 --> 09:07.420
<i>a high-level quest reward.</i>

09:07.940 --> 09:10.840
<i>And the way they work so well together.</i>

09:13.210 --> 09:17.570
<i>I've fought with my lord several times.</i>

09:18.530 --> 09:22.330
<i>But I couldn't even approach that...</i>

09:23.160 --> 09:25.030
<i>I must practice more.</i>

09:25.920 --> 09:27.000
Akatsuki?

09:27.000 --> 09:28.230
Did you eat too much?

09:28.230 --> 09:29.470
No...

09:29.470 --> 09:33.170
But just now, you told a lie.

09:34.870 --> 09:38.900
Naotsugu couldn't possibly have been 
a member of such a legendary party.

09:38.900 --> 09:40.390
It's true!

09:42.210 --> 09:47.400
That said, we went many different places.

09:47.710 --> 09:50.370
We also had many friends. It was fun!

09:52.070 --> 09:53.600
Meow.

10:07.200 --> 10:09.790
<i>Nyanta is so cool!</i>

10:10.350 --> 10:13.300
<i>A handsome young man, 
kind and always willing to help!</i>

10:13.730 --> 10:17.300
<i>No, I think he's older... 
A handsome middle-aged man?</i>

10:17.300 --> 10:21.040
<i>But he's so in shape!</i>

10:21.040 --> 10:24.340
<i>Next to him, I look kind of fat!</i>

10:24.340 --> 10:27.310
<i>I am a little overweight.</i>

10:27.310 --> 10:29.010
<i>But! But!</i>

10:29.010 --> 10:30.620
<i>So obvious...</i>

10:30.620 --> 10:31.560
Meow.

10:31.940 --> 10:34.340
So she's after middle-aged guys?

10:34.340 --> 10:36.060
He just seems like an adult.

10:36.060 --> 10:37.940
All that meowing is annoying, though.

10:39.010 --> 10:40.470
Serara has good taste.

10:41.620 --> 10:44.330
You feel the same way about him?

10:44.330 --> 10:46.910
The master is a first-class swordsman.

10:47.550 --> 10:49.180
<i>That said...</i>

10:50.250 --> 10:52.920
<i>Chief Nyanta is all right with them?</i>

10:52.920 --> 10:54.380
My lord, my lord.

10:55.500 --> 11:00.510
You aren't a swordsman, but you 
are very talented, as well.

11:00.510 --> 11:04.060
Oh... Are you trying to console me?

11:05.610 --> 11:07.060
Nope.

11:10.940 --> 11:14.080
When you see her like this, 
she really does look young.

11:14.420 --> 11:16.160
How old do you suppose she is?

11:16.160 --> 11:19.570
In this world, you can't tell by looking at them.

11:19.890 --> 11:22.740
Just based on looks, you'd say 
Akatsuki was in elemen—

11:24.700 --> 11:26.660
Middle school, maybe?

11:27.270 --> 11:30.920
Which would make her the 
same age as those twins.

11:31.320 --> 11:32.450
Twins?

11:32.450 --> 11:34.920
I ran into them when this was a game.

11:35.500 --> 11:39.680
The girl was a shrine maiden, 
and the boy was a samurai.

11:41.230 --> 11:43.820
Mister! Mister! Hey, stop!

11:43.820 --> 11:46.990
Um, may we ask something?

11:46.990 --> 11:48.470
Question!

11:48.470 --> 11:52.580
My magic is too weak to heal 
my little brother's wounds.

11:52.580 --> 11:54.940
Supposedly, we should buy items.

11:54.940 --> 11:57.560
But we don't know where they're sold...

11:57.560 --> 11:59.390
I want skills, too.

11:59.390 --> 12:01.600
If you know where to get them, tell us!

12:01.600 --> 12:04.600
Is this your first day?

12:04.600 --> 12:05.510
Yes.

12:05.510 --> 12:06.700
That's right!

12:08.650 --> 12:11.990
Have you always been that nice?

12:11.990 --> 12:15.040
I don't like it when people come to me 
because they want something...

12:15.520 --> 12:16.750
Meow...

12:16.750 --> 12:18.880
But those two were beginners.

12:18.880 --> 12:21.960
They seemed to be having 
a great time adventuring.

12:21.960 --> 12:27.420
So I showed them the ropes for a while, 
using the Teacher System.

12:27.420 --> 12:29.310
Teacher System?

12:29.560 --> 12:33.280
A system that lets high-level 
players lower their levels

12:33.280 --> 12:35.800
to play with lower-leveled characters.

12:33.440 --> 12:37.100
<b>Teacher System</b>

12:35.800 --> 12:38.490
Hardly anyone used it.

12:39.320 --> 12:40.830
It was risky.

12:40.830 --> 12:45.030
All your stats took a huge hit, 
even if only temporarily...

12:45.030 --> 12:47.590
Why would you drop your level?

12:49.290 --> 12:50.910
Wait, I see.

12:51.150 --> 12:54.600
You're pretty smart, Akatsuki.

12:55.320 --> 12:57.440
And where are those two now?

12:57.440 --> 12:59.300
On my Friend List.

12:59.300 --> 13:03.550
<b>Tohya 

Minori 

Shigeru 

Crusty</b>

12:59.810 --> 13:03.550
The sister is Minori, and her 
younger brother is Tohya.

13:04.170 --> 13:07.550
I saw them after the Apocalypse.

13:07.550 --> 13:09.970
Then they were caught up in it.

13:09.970 --> 13:11.960
I was with them right up until it happened.

13:11.960 --> 13:14.350
Then, the next thing I knew, 
I was back in Akihabara.

13:14.350 --> 13:15.650
And they were gone.

13:16.150 --> 13:19.270
I was also teleported, into an abandoned building.

13:21.550 --> 13:24.070
You should have said something to them.

13:24.070 --> 13:26.280
I'm sure they've been having a hard time.

13:27.500 --> 13:28.780
Yeah.

13:31.840 --> 13:35.420
Well, I'm sure he had his reasons.

13:36.120 --> 13:38.380
We had our hands full.

13:38.960 --> 13:41.800
I doubt we had the energy to spare...

13:42.200 --> 13:45.760
And when I saw them, they were both in a guild.

13:45.960 --> 13:47.320
Yeah?

13:47.320 --> 13:49.600
At the time, they were level 8.

13:49.600 --> 13:52.150
Now, they might be a little higher.

13:52.150 --> 13:55.270
If they're in a guild, they should be fine.

13:55.270 --> 13:57.100
By the way, Shiroe...

13:58.280 --> 14:01.400
Was Minori cute?

14:01.400 --> 14:03.090
I don't know...

14:03.090 --> 14:05.500
In the real world, all I could hear was her voice.

14:05.500 --> 14:07.110
And when I saw her, I couldn't see her face.

14:07.110 --> 14:08.770
No, no, no.

14:08.770 --> 14:10.780
You can tell some things from the voice...

14:11.000 --> 14:12.690
Stupid pervert Naotsugu.

14:12.690 --> 14:14.660
Better than being a closet pervert!

14:14.960 --> 14:17.390
Shut up... You're making my tea taste bad.

14:17.390 --> 14:19.960
So let's talk about which is better, 
being closeted or open!

14:27.220 --> 14:28.800
Hey, Shiro!

14:28.800 --> 14:30.220
The rain clouds are closing in.

14:30.570 --> 14:36.030
Shiroe, we should probably 
find some shelter soon.

14:36.030 --> 14:36.730
Yes.

14:37.560 --> 14:38.730
In this zone,

14:39.100 --> 14:42.060
I think there's a village past those woods.

14:46.320 --> 14:48.170
Where are we?

14:48.170 --> 14:50.870
The south end of the Arb Highlands.

14:51.440 --> 14:52.820
Shiroe...

14:52.820 --> 14:53.650
Yes?

14:53.650 --> 14:56.500
Have you been alone since then?

14:57.750 --> 15:00.250
Without joining any guilds?

15:00.700 --> 15:04.250
Wh-What about you? 
What happened with that guild?

15:04.530 --> 15:06.410
Um, you know...

15:06.410 --> 15:07.950
The Cat Food guild!

15:07.950 --> 15:09.860
What's that?

15:09.860 --> 15:14.350
A proud organization comprised 
solely of cat people.

15:15.130 --> 15:18.310
I loved sitting on the porch, 
but the house was getting old.

15:18.310 --> 15:20.270
Something like that...

15:23.710 --> 15:25.070
How wonderful!

15:25.570 --> 15:28.340
But it couldn't handle the bad weather,

15:28.340 --> 15:29.970
so half the house caved in.

15:29.970 --> 15:31.950
Then it basically disbanded...

15:35.260 --> 15:36.950
Hello!

15:37.710 --> 15:39.240
We're travelers.

15:39.240 --> 15:41.460
Could you put us up for the night?

15:41.750 --> 15:44.960
Oh, my... Adventurers?

15:45.370 --> 15:47.130
That's a rare sight.

15:47.860 --> 15:48.810
Yo!

15:48.810 --> 15:51.450
Welcome to the village of Arb.

15:51.450 --> 15:54.770
<i>A non-player character? 
A Person of the Land?</i>

15:54.770 --> 15:58.410
My name is Fedor. I'm the village ombudsman.

15:58.410 --> 15:59.600
Nice to meet you.

16:00.700 --> 16:02.410
Nice to meet you.

16:02.410 --> 16:04.360
Eh? So you have a name...

16:07.140 --> 16:11.430
You may use this barn as you like.

16:11.430 --> 16:12.600
Thank you.

16:13.540 --> 16:15.030
Straw!

16:15.030 --> 16:17.680
Move. We have to give everyone some.

16:17.680 --> 16:18.540
What?

16:19.010 --> 16:21.140
Do you have a hearth?

16:21.140 --> 16:23.560
Right over there.

16:23.560 --> 16:26.600
Let's go prepare dinner, Nyanta.

16:26.600 --> 16:28.200
Give me more!

16:28.200 --> 16:29.670
This is for my lord!

16:29.670 --> 16:30.520
What?

16:30.520 --> 16:32.920
Your friends are quite lively.

16:32.920 --> 16:34.180
Yeah...

16:35.670 --> 16:38.830
Oh... So you're going to Akihabara.

16:38.830 --> 16:39.830
Yes.

16:39.830 --> 16:43.340
We People of the Land travel little.

16:43.340 --> 16:45.690
If you want to hear tales of our 
travels, we have plenty!

16:45.690 --> 16:48.610
I'd love to hear them.

16:52.360 --> 16:55.760
Don't just stand there... Come in.

16:55.760 --> 16:57.620
Don't be afraid.

16:58.140 --> 16:59.490
Hi!

16:59.490 --> 17:00.530
Hello.

17:00.530 --> 17:01.890
You're cute...

17:01.890 --> 17:02.620
Who are you?

17:03.480 --> 17:04.510
Mischa!

17:04.510 --> 17:05.500
Ivan!

17:05.500 --> 17:07.440
Mischa and Ivan, huh?

17:07.440 --> 17:08.620
Good names!

17:10.910 --> 17:11.900
A ninja?

17:11.900 --> 17:12.550
A ninja!

17:12.550 --> 17:13.790
It's a ninja!

17:13.790 --> 17:15.260
Throw a shuriken!

17:15.260 --> 17:16.810
Come on...

17:16.810 --> 17:18.970
I guess they like her.

17:18.970 --> 17:20.060
They're all kids—

17:23.300 --> 17:25.310
They're my grandchildren...

17:25.740 --> 17:28.640
When they were born, it was very difficult.

17:28.640 --> 17:30.070
Oh, really?

17:30.070 --> 17:31.670
There was a blizzard outside.

17:31.670 --> 17:35.140
And their father had gone to the town market.

17:35.140 --> 17:37.070
I was the only man here,

17:37.070 --> 17:40.080
so I carried their mother to the doctor, 
on the other side of the mountain.

17:39.280 --> 17:40.520
Come here, grandpa!

17:40.520 --> 17:41.950
Oh, right...

17:42.440 --> 17:47.460
So even NPCs not part of events 
have that kind of a backstory.

17:48.060 --> 17:51.710
The more I talk to them, 
the more human they seem.

17:52.340 --> 17:53.910
They are human.

17:55.140 --> 18:00.720
They have names... 
Families, feelings, and memories.

18:01.530 --> 18:04.610
We adventurers have powerful bodies,

18:04.610 --> 18:07.810
and can revive, no matter how often we die.

18:08.970 --> 18:13.780
In this world, wouldn't that 
make us the abnormal ones?

18:15.210 --> 18:16.780
I guess so.

18:17.470 --> 18:19.670
They live as one with the land.

18:20.300 --> 18:21.790
That's how they get their name.

18:22.390 --> 18:27.420
Ever since the Apocalypse, it seems 
like I've seen far more of them...

18:28.060 --> 18:32.480
Maybe we just never noticed 
when it was a game.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.300
Maybe.

18:34.850 --> 18:36.050
Ta-dah!

18:36.050 --> 18:38.120
Look at this!

18:38.120 --> 18:40.800
We went around to some neighboring houses.

18:40.800 --> 18:44.180
They were nice enough to sell us some food.

18:44.180 --> 18:45.780
Isn't this great?

18:45.780 --> 18:48.100
Cheese! Sausage!

18:48.100 --> 18:51.200
They aren't crafted?

18:51.200 --> 18:52.690
Then how?

18:53.040 --> 18:56.370
No, come to think of it, 
those are ingredient items.

18:56.370 --> 18:58.570
Some strange parts are just like the game...

18:59.040 --> 19:01.690
There's butter and eggs!

19:01.690 --> 19:04.450
I bought salt in Susukino...

19:04.450 --> 19:07.300
So we can make cookies. 
Right, Nyanta?

19:07.300 --> 19:08.210
Meow.

19:08.760 --> 19:11.210
Cookies?

19:23.100 --> 19:24.930
What are these?

19:28.600 --> 19:29.740
So good!

19:33.660 --> 19:35.190
Get moving!

19:35.520 --> 19:38.190
We need to get back before the triffids respawn.

19:38.830 --> 19:41.410
Our healer was sent to the Cathedral...

19:41.950 --> 19:45.660
Jeez, why do I have to babysit these guys?

19:45.900 --> 19:47.660
My luck sucks.

19:49.380 --> 19:50.640
You okay?

19:50.640 --> 19:51.950
I'm sorry.

19:51.950 --> 19:54.080
I just feel kind of lightheaded.

19:54.080 --> 19:54.790
That guy...

19:55.420 --> 19:58.760
Two of us died today because of that guy!

19:58.760 --> 19:59.550
But...

19:59.920 --> 20:03.300
I hate to say it, but it's because we're weak.

20:03.550 --> 20:05.750
My luck sucks...

20:05.750 --> 20:08.190
We didn't hit our quota.

20:08.190 --> 20:10.550
It's because your levels are too low!

20:11.180 --> 20:16.500
No, it's because his level is 
too high, so we stand out.

20:16.500 --> 20:17.820
What do you mean?

20:18.190 --> 20:19.820
I don't really understand it,

20:20.340 --> 20:22.820
but he attracts all the enemies.

20:22.820 --> 20:26.370
As the tank, drawing their attention is my job.

20:26.370 --> 20:29.100
That's why our formation always falls apart.

20:30.140 --> 20:32.620
Now that you mention it, you're right.

20:33.290 --> 20:34.650
I get it.

20:34.650 --> 20:38.840
That's why he used that Teacher System thing.

20:38.840 --> 20:42.370
Hey, stop talking and walk!

20:43.110 --> 20:45.820
Come on, we're almost to Akihabara.

20:45.820 --> 20:47.040
We can do it.

20:47.040 --> 20:48.190
Yeah.

20:53.550 --> 20:58.020
After a while, those wounds will 
heal on their own, but...

20:58.630 --> 21:01.070
Every day is rough for you, Tohya.

21:01.070 --> 21:03.530
What about you, Minori?

21:03.940 --> 21:05.350
These injuries...

21:05.350 --> 21:07.030
I spend the whole day sewing.

21:08.580 --> 21:11.450
Why did we join this guild?

21:12.110 --> 21:13.650
We couldn't do anything else.

21:13.650 --> 21:16.690
There's so much we didn't know.

21:19.150 --> 21:20.700
It's time...

21:20.700 --> 21:22.130
Show us what you've got.

21:26.870 --> 21:29.180
You're lucky...

21:29.180 --> 21:34.060
You're useless, but you can still 
earn three meals a day.

21:37.180 --> 21:40.570
At a time like this, what would he do?

21:41.160 --> 21:42.900
What would Shiroe do?

21:45.310 --> 21:46.900
Shiroe...

21:51.580 --> 21:53.640
Okay, everyone's here.

21:53.640 --> 21:56.200
Let's go. Don't screw up today.

21:56.200 --> 21:57.630
Got it?

21:56.200 --> 22:00.710
Serara! I'm so glad you're all right! 
Thanks, Shiro!

22:00.710 --> 22:01.720
Thank you!

22:01.720 --> 22:03.720
You don't need to thank me, Mari.

22:04.400 --> 22:07.220
<i>That voice... It must be.</i>

22:07.220 --> 22:08.830
<i>It's Shiroe!</i>

22:17.970 --> 22:20.120
Hey! What are you doing?

22:20.120 --> 22:21.320
Come on!

24:05.580 --> 24:07.250
We returned to Akihabara,

24:07.250 --> 24:09.530
which seemed to be regaining a measure of peace.

24:09.530 --> 24:14.350
But it was a false peace, in which the 
powerful stole from the weak.

24:14.350 --> 24:17.490
Are there some who realize it, 
but can do nothing?

24:17.490 --> 24:19.060
Is Shiroe one of them?

24:19.060 --> 24:22.940
Can he do nothing but watch, 
as the world becomes twisted?

24:22.940 --> 24:29.990
<b>Resolve</b>

24:23.260 --> 24:25.050
Next time: Resolve.

24:25.050 --> 24:26.980
This is our reality.
