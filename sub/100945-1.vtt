00:11.678 --> 00:13.013
Four-star general.

00:13.096 --> 00:15.765
There is no rank higher
in the United States military.

00:16.391 --> 00:20.186
You report only to Sec Def and POTUS,
the commander in chief.

00:20.270 --> 00:21.896
Congratulations, General Naird.

00:24.733 --> 00:26.985
Thank you. Thank you.

00:28.028 --> 00:30.864
It has always been my dream
to command a service branch.

00:31.865 --> 00:36.995
I have been shot down,
both literally and figuratively,

00:37.454 --> 00:38.997
but I have always gotten back up.

00:40.665 --> 00:41.750
All right.

00:41.833 --> 00:46.880
My old CO used to say
that the greatest asset in an F-35,

00:46.963 --> 00:49.215
and that is a $100 million plane,

00:49.799 --> 00:50.884
is its pilot.

00:51.301 --> 00:53.553
When I was-- All right. I'll skip ahead.

00:53.636 --> 00:55.472
There's much more that I could say.

00:58.058 --> 00:59.392
I only wish that...

01:00.602 --> 01:03.646
my parents could have been here
to see this.

01:05.190 --> 01:07.901
But they were unable
to get flights from New Jersey in time.

01:09.944 --> 01:13.573
Maggie, Erin,
this is a Naird family team win.

01:14.783 --> 01:15.742
Woo-woo.

01:18.870 --> 01:20.413
-So proud of you.
-Thanks.

01:21.164 --> 01:22.248
I don't get it.

01:22.582 --> 01:26.461
Dad, when you made three-star,
we had 100 guests and a band.

01:26.544 --> 01:28.088
It's a different administration, bug.

01:28.171 --> 01:30.298
This one's... a little more chaotic.

01:31.341 --> 01:35.178
The Air Force chief's house in Arlington
is gorgeous and comes with a staff.

01:35.261 --> 01:36.096
Thank you.

01:36.179 --> 01:38.181
Dad, I am so proud of you.

01:38.598 --> 01:39.891
-Thanks.
-General.

01:40.934 --> 01:43.478
Joint Chiefs in five minutes. Come on.

01:45.563 --> 01:46.564
Kick.

01:46.648 --> 01:49.192
Get lost, Naird. This is for four-stars.

01:49.275 --> 01:50.235
Like me.

01:51.236 --> 01:53.279
They didn't tell you? Or did you forget?

01:53.363 --> 01:56.574
Like you forgot to get competitive bidding
for the AT-6B.

01:56.658 --> 01:58.493
Tell me what? That you wear a dress?

01:59.452 --> 02:00.829
I knew that already.

02:01.621 --> 02:03.081
Gender roles.

02:03.164 --> 02:05.959
Offensive. And out of date. Just like you.

02:06.417 --> 02:08.086
But I don't have to listen to it anymore.

02:08.795 --> 02:10.672
Good luck with your retirement, Kick.

02:10.755 --> 02:12.382
And I say that facetiously,

02:12.465 --> 02:15.468
because you're a crook and a womanizer,
and I hate your guts.

02:16.094 --> 02:17.220
God, that felt good.

02:19.222 --> 02:21.015
Welcome, gentlemen,
thank you for joining us.

02:21.099 --> 02:22.475
POTUS wants to make some changes.

02:22.559 --> 02:26.146
He's tweeting about it in five minutes,
so let's hope you like it.

02:26.688 --> 02:30.066
I wanna welcome our newest
four-star general, Mark Naird,

02:30.150 --> 02:32.443
formerly number two at the Air Force.

02:32.902 --> 02:35.738
He's done an amazing job,
has a most distinguished career.

02:36.948 --> 02:38.616
-Our nation's internet in--
- Excuse me.

02:38.700 --> 02:41.077
Why is Kick still in the room? I don't--
Hmm.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.454
Our nation's internet, including Twitter,

02:43.538 --> 02:46.457
runs through
our vulnerable space satellites.

02:46.541 --> 02:49.335
POTUS wants complete space dominance.

02:49.419 --> 02:51.629
Boots on the moon by 2024.

02:52.380 --> 02:55.341
To that end,
the president is creating a new branch.

02:55.842 --> 02:56.718
Space Force.

02:57.802 --> 02:58.803
Which Mark will run.

02:58.887 --> 03:00.263
Hmm? What?

03:00.346 --> 03:03.308
In close cooperation with Air Force,
which Kick will still head.

03:03.391 --> 03:04.642
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.

03:04.726 --> 03:06.311
This is not a joke. His words!

03:06.394 --> 03:08.271
Boots on the moon in 2024.

03:09.022 --> 03:13.276
Actually, he said, "Boobs on the moon,"
but we believe that to be a typo.

03:13.359 --> 03:15.820
This is bullshit.
Space is part of the air.

03:16.321 --> 03:17.822
Naird works for me.

03:17.906 --> 03:21.492
Uh, hang on. Hang on.
I don't think there's air in space.

03:21.576 --> 03:24.454
There certainly isn't any damn water,
Admiral, so you don't get an opinion.

03:24.537 --> 03:27.207
Air Force used to just be part
of the Army, Kick.

03:27.290 --> 03:29.000
I'd like to stuff you both back in.

03:29.083 --> 03:31.211
If there's no air or water, two questions.

03:31.294 --> 03:35.006
What is it exactly,
and why can't they hear you scream?

03:35.882 --> 03:39.010
Well, at least Coast Guard
isn't last in line anymore.

03:39.302 --> 03:41.387
-Oh, you're still last.
-Oh, definitely last.

03:41.471 --> 03:43.640
You're behind Salvation Army, Louis.

04:09.499 --> 04:11.542
So, how are you handling this?

04:11.626 --> 04:15.171
I know you wanted the Air Force,
and you're not the most flexible person.

04:15.255 --> 04:17.215
I can be flexible
if I'm ordered to be.

04:21.678 --> 04:26.015
I'll admit
I was a little disappointed at first.

04:26.474 --> 04:29.894
But then I saw this painting.
John Paul Jones.

04:30.228 --> 04:31.604
<i>And it made me think.</i>

04:32.397 --> 04:35.900
<i>The founder of the Space Force,</i>
<i>that's going to be me.</i>

04:36.276 --> 04:40.405
This is such a great opportunity
to start something from the ground up.

04:40.780 --> 04:42.615
We're gonna build a huge new base.

04:42.699 --> 04:43.658
Mmm.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.244
Well, DC real estate, the way it is,

04:46.327 --> 04:48.621
you'll be lucky
if it's this side of Dulles Airport.

04:48.705 --> 04:52.000
Oh, well, it's definitely gonna be
on the other side of Dulles.

04:52.083 --> 04:53.876
By about 2,000 miles.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.920
-We're going to Colorado.
-What?

04:56.004 --> 04:59.882
There's this old NORAD facility
that's got a lot of potential.

04:59.966 --> 05:01.801
And Colorado? Oh!

05:02.760 --> 05:04.137
Up and coming.

05:04.220 --> 05:06.514
Did you know Amazon put
their new headquarters there?

05:06.597 --> 05:07.890
Really?

05:08.182 --> 05:10.601
No. But they seriously considered it.

05:11.269 --> 05:13.021
You and Erin are gonna love it there.

05:13.229 --> 05:15.064
-Gonna learn how to ride horses.

05:15.148 --> 05:16.482
It's gonna be a good year.

05:17.817 --> 05:20.111
And next year at this time...

05:21.195 --> 05:23.114
we might have boots on the moon.

05:38.880 --> 05:40.131
Big launch today, huh?

05:41.591 --> 05:42.508
Launch?

05:42.925 --> 05:44.052
At the new base.

05:45.261 --> 05:46.137
What base?

05:46.554 --> 05:48.222
Oh, right. It's a secret.

05:48.681 --> 05:51.351
If you told me,
you'd have to kill me, right?

- Hey.
-Sir.

07:20.940 --> 07:23.192
There's a guy in the trunk.
Hold him till after the launch.

07:23.276 --> 07:24.235
Yes, sir.

07:26.028 --> 07:27.321
What the fuck, man?

07:50.970 --> 07:52.972
<i>So then you say do bat your eye--</i>

07:53.764 --> 07:55.224
-Big launch today, sir.
<i>-</i>Yes.

07:55.308 --> 07:57.477
The congressional delegation
will be arriving for lunch.

07:57.560 --> 07:58.728
You have to speak for ten minutes

07:58.811 --> 08:00.104
-at the local high school.

08:00.188 --> 08:01.772
Don't worry. We have a new helo pilot.

08:01.856 --> 08:03.316
We'll get you in and out of there
in no time.

08:03.733 --> 08:05.193
And the launch at 1700

08:05.276 --> 08:07.820
is set to be a live feed
on the East Coast.

08:07.904 --> 08:09.989
You have a light day today,
so you can start in the gym,

08:10.072 --> 08:12.783
and your calendar says it's a leg day.

08:15.411 --> 08:16.412
Dr. Mallory.

08:18.581 --> 08:20.750
Oh! Dr. Mallory is waiting for you.

08:20.833 --> 08:22.460
Yes, he is.

08:22.543 --> 08:24.879
-He said not to say anything.
-Thank you, Brad.

08:26.547 --> 08:28.758
We need to cancel the launch.

08:28.841 --> 08:29.759
No.

08:29.842 --> 08:31.302
Senator Schugler, Pitosi,

08:31.385 --> 08:33.471
and the angry young congresswoman
are coming.

08:33.554 --> 08:35.932
They need to see a success
so we can keep our funding.

08:36.015 --> 08:38.059
Oh. My idea of success

08:38.142 --> 08:41.938
would not be
a six-billion-dollar piece of hardware

08:42.021 --> 08:44.023
breaking up over Denver.

08:44.106 --> 08:45.483
That is not going to happen.

08:45.566 --> 08:47.818
Look, I don't like to pull rank,

08:47.902 --> 08:50.905
-but I order you to postpone the launch.
-Ah...

08:50.988 --> 08:51.822
Okay?

08:51.906 --> 08:54.158
There's too much moisture in the air.

08:54.242 --> 08:56.827
We prefer a less ionized environment.

08:56.911 --> 08:59.038
You are a civilian advisor.

08:59.288 --> 09:01.207
There are always going to be risks.

09:01.290 --> 09:04.126
Conditions are never perfect.

09:04.210 --> 09:06.128
They're supposed to be perfect tomorrow.

09:06.212 --> 09:08.297
The delegation
will be back in Washington tomorrow.

09:08.381 --> 09:11.092
-You know, Mark, when I hired you...
-I hired you.

09:11.175 --> 09:15.763
...I felt your best quality
was your ability to listen to good advice.

09:15.846 --> 09:17.014
If you've lost that,

09:17.098 --> 09:18.933
we may have to look elsewhere.

09:19.350 --> 09:22.103
We. Who is this "we"
that you keep talking about?

09:22.186 --> 09:24.063
That is above your pay grade.

09:24.146 --> 09:26.274
Nothing is above my pay grade
at this base.

09:26.357 --> 09:28.401
Just postpone the launch, dear.

09:28.484 --> 09:29.360
Nope.

09:36.158 --> 09:37.577
So, no launch today, I hear.

09:37.660 --> 09:38.869
No, launch is still on.

09:38.953 --> 09:41.163
Oh. I'll have to tell the base biologist.

09:41.247 --> 09:42.206
-What?
-She has to collect

09:42.290 --> 09:45.042
all the endangered lizards
within 600 yards of the launch site.

09:45.126 --> 09:47.712
I canceled her because Mallory told me
the launch was scrubbed.

09:47.795 --> 09:50.464
No! Nobody gets to scrub anything but me.

09:50.548 --> 09:51.882
Oh. Got it, sir.

09:56.721 --> 09:57.722
Hello, Yuri.

09:59.599 --> 10:00.933
Oh. Uh, Yuri's in there.

10:01.017 --> 10:02.893
-I know.
-He told me not to say anything.

10:03.477 --> 10:04.520
Thank you, Brad.

10:05.479 --> 10:06.981
Do you keep breath mints anywhere?

10:07.064 --> 10:08.316
What are you doing in here?

10:08.399 --> 10:10.359
Um, I heard the launch was scrubbed.

10:10.443 --> 10:12.236
That is not accurate, Yuri.

10:12.320 --> 10:14.572
Call me Bobby. It's more reassuring.

10:15.031 --> 10:19.118
Can I see technical specifications
for the Epsilon part E-16f fuel pump?

10:19.702 --> 10:21.495
Why would you need to see that?

10:21.579 --> 10:23.706
Well, as observer
from ISS partner country,

10:23.789 --> 10:25.791
I just want to... observe it.

10:25.875 --> 10:28.711
Hmm. Well, that is weird.

10:29.211 --> 10:33.633
Your president desires close cooperation
and good relations between US and Russia.

10:34.383 --> 10:36.427
Come on. We're not China here.

10:37.261 --> 10:39.639
I'm sure if the president would like me
to show you something,

10:39.722 --> 10:40.848
he will let me know.

10:41.265 --> 10:42.141
Very well.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.268
Expect a text from the secure phone.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.437
How do you know about the secure phone?

10:46.937 --> 10:48.522
I don't know about the secure phone.

10:48.606 --> 10:50.691
-You just said "secure phone."
-No, I didn't.

10:50.775 --> 10:52.568
-Yes, you did. You said "secure phone."
-I didn't say that.

10:52.652 --> 10:53.569
You just said it.

10:53.653 --> 10:54.904
-No, I did not.
-Yes, you did.

10:54.987 --> 10:55.821
Oh!

10:55.905 --> 10:56.822
Breath mints.

10:56.906 --> 10:57.782
Here they are.

Yo! Oh.

11:24.642 --> 11:26.936
-General Naird.
-We may have to scrub the Epsilon launch.

11:27.019 --> 11:29.355
-Is Yellowjacket ready to show off?
-I doubt it.

11:29.438 --> 11:32.149
Oh, for Christ's sake. They're a billion
dollars and six months over.

11:32.233 --> 11:33.859
You're right.
We should be able to see something.

11:33.943 --> 11:35.861
-Damn right. Let's move.
-I'll make a call.

11:38.280 --> 11:39.949
-Are you running?
-No. Keep up.

11:40.032 --> 11:41.575
Will Yellowjacket be impressive enough?

11:41.659 --> 11:44.995
First super-pressurized ultra-fast
satellite-killer killer missile?

11:45.079 --> 11:46.330
Fucking impressive to me.

11:50.084 --> 11:52.169
Oh. Hey. Looks good.

11:52.545 --> 11:53.671
-Yeah.
- Sweet.

11:53.754 --> 11:54.755
Very sleek.

11:54.839 --> 11:56.590
-Like the yellow fins.
-Mm-hmm.

11:56.841 --> 11:59.635
Do we have enough of these
to do a test launch later as well?

12:00.010 --> 12:00.970
Yes, sir.

12:01.679 --> 12:03.180
Okay, let's do this.

12:04.390 --> 12:06.100
-Go time.
- <i>Roger that, go time.</i>

12:23.284 --> 12:24.660
Well, that's not ready yet.

12:25.411 --> 12:27.204
-How much was that prototype?
-Four.

12:27.288 --> 12:28.789
-Million?
-Middle schools.

12:29.331 --> 12:30.916
Cost as much as four new middle schools.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.001
Fuck!

12:32.501 --> 12:34.003
-You are running!
-Keep up.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.715
So I hear we're going with Yellowjacket
this afternoon?

12:37.798 --> 12:38.632
No.

12:39.425 --> 12:41.343
Sorry, Sheila.
Still have to grab those lizards.

12:42.178 --> 12:43.179
Hey.

12:44.972 --> 12:46.265
Oh. Fuck Tony's in there.

12:49.518 --> 12:51.103
-Good morning, my general.
-Good morning.

12:51.187 --> 12:53.481
I have your daily tweet ready
for you to review,

12:53.564 --> 12:56.484
and I think you're gonna love it.
You're gonna eat it up. Go. Yum-yum.

12:58.360 --> 12:59.195
I...

13:00.070 --> 13:01.489
I don't get it.

13:01.947 --> 13:02.782
Any of it?

13:04.033 --> 13:04.909
Okay.

13:05.576 --> 13:06.410
All right.

13:06.494 --> 13:09.038
-You know there's a new <i>Star Wars</i> out?
-Yes.

13:09.121 --> 13:11.874
And Wendy's has a new hamburger
that they're serving rare, so...

13:11.957 --> 13:14.668
So what I am saying is
that if I had a lightsaber,

13:14.752 --> 13:16.128
I would be able to cook...

13:16.921 --> 13:18.047
this hamburger better.

13:18.130 --> 13:19.965
There you go.
It took a while, but you got it.

13:20.049 --> 13:22.843
-How is this relevant to the mission?
-That is culturally relevant.

13:22.927 --> 13:25.679
I don't see how being snarky
about a fast-food hamburger

13:25.763 --> 13:27.264
is culturally anything.

13:27.723 --> 13:30.309
Do you even understand
what is at stake here?

13:30.392 --> 13:32.269
I'm trying to put boots on the moon.

13:32.728 --> 13:34.063
Boots on the moon.

13:34.146 --> 13:36.148
A laser sword is a child's toy.

13:36.232 --> 13:37.650
It's a lightsaber.

13:37.733 --> 13:39.777
Did you hear yourself? Laser sword?

13:39.860 --> 13:41.028
Okay. I think we're done.

13:41.111 --> 13:43.197
-You don't understand because you're old.
-Okay.

13:43.280 --> 13:46.242
You get likes
by dunking on the Twitter accounts

13:46.325 --> 13:48.619
-of sassy fast-food brands.
-Sassy.

13:48.702 --> 13:51.163
I don't even know why
I'm explaining clapback theory to you.

13:51.247 --> 13:53.415
Every time I explain anything,
it seems to just go "phew."

13:53.499 --> 13:54.834
How about this for sass?

13:54.917 --> 13:56.502
-You're fired.
-What?

13:56.585 --> 13:58.838
Your services will no longer be needed
here at Space Force.

13:59.255 --> 14:00.840
You're firing me
for writing a perfect tweet?

14:00.923 --> 14:03.592
Is that why you're firing me?
Fine, fine, fine. You know what?

14:03.676 --> 14:05.469
Enjoy your 3,000 engineer followers,

14:05.553 --> 14:07.096
because, honestly, you are hopeless.

14:10.933 --> 14:12.142
-Brad.
<i>-Yes, sir.</i>

14:12.226 --> 14:15.187
Would you make sure that Tony is detained
until after the launch

14:15.271 --> 14:16.730
so he doesn't tweet anything snotty?

14:16.814 --> 14:18.107
- <i>Got it.</i>
-Thank you.

14:18.941 --> 14:20.442
-Secure the phone.
-Yes, sir.

14:21.235 --> 14:23.529
What's going on? Are you serious? Stop--

14:23.612 --> 14:26.115
Siri, send tweet. Send tweet!

14:28.993 --> 14:30.619
Where are you?

14:31.036 --> 14:33.080
It's good for you. Come on out.

14:33.914 --> 14:35.249
Ooh, gotcha.

14:38.460 --> 14:39.962
A little low, don't you think?

14:40.462 --> 14:41.922
I'm flying safely, sir.

14:42.590 --> 14:44.091
But I can lift up if you like.

14:44.675 --> 14:45.843
At your discretion.

14:54.143 --> 14:56.812
You're, uh--
You're rated for F-35s, aren't you, sir?

14:58.397 --> 15:03.694
Yes, I believe I've flown every F series
from the Tomcat to the F-117 Nighthawk.

15:03.777 --> 15:04.945
That's dope, sir.

15:07.990 --> 15:08.991
What's your name?

15:09.074 --> 15:10.534
Captain Angela Ali, sir.

15:10.618 --> 15:11.660
ROTC?

15:11.744 --> 15:13.537
OCS. Uh, I'm actually a prior.

15:13.621 --> 15:15.539
I transferred as a First Class, sir.

15:15.623 --> 15:17.041
Air Force or Space Force?

15:17.499 --> 15:18.542
Space Force, sir.

15:18.834 --> 15:20.586
You don't like to use your full title?

15:21.211 --> 15:22.212
Sorry, sir.

15:22.296 --> 15:23.631
Spaceman First Class.

15:23.714 --> 15:25.257
Nothing to be ashamed of.

15:25.591 --> 15:28.302
Air Force has airmen.
Space Force has spacemen.

15:28.886 --> 15:30.971
Nothing embarrassing or comical about it.

15:32.514 --> 15:33.349
Yes, sir.

15:34.558 --> 15:38.604
The Earth is the only planet
in our universe<i> </i>that we know of

15:38.687 --> 15:40.272
that sustains life.

15:41.106 --> 15:42.650
Fifty years ago,

15:42.733 --> 15:46.445
Americans landed on the lunar surface
and took that photo.

15:47.112 --> 15:48.656
Hashtag "awesome," huh?

15:49.490 --> 15:50.658
Well, guess what, kids?

15:51.533 --> 15:52.660
We're going back.

15:53.118 --> 15:54.620
Not for science this time.

15:54.703 --> 15:56.330
Not to collect a bunch of rocks.

15:56.413 --> 15:57.498
But to occupy.

15:57.581 --> 15:59.333
Boots on the moon!

16:01.502 --> 16:02.544
Boots on the moon.

16:03.212 --> 16:06.715
And even though this will be
an international mission,

16:06.799 --> 16:10.761
harnessing the best and brightest minds
from around the globe,

16:11.553 --> 16:14.348
rest assured these will be US boots.

16:15.808 --> 16:18.102
Boots with US feet in 'em, I mean.

16:19.561 --> 16:22.189
Can't be certain
where the boots will actually be made.

16:22.272 --> 16:24.066
Maybe Mexico. Maybe Portugal.

16:24.149 --> 16:25.776
We're getting bids on the boots.

16:25.859 --> 16:27.486
One thing's for certain, though.

16:27.861 --> 16:29.989
Those boots
are gonna have our feet in 'em.

16:30.072 --> 16:30.990
Seniors,

16:31.407 --> 16:35.953
if you enlist for a four-year stint
as a space cadet,

16:36.537 --> 16:40.207
you can earn up to $35,000 for college.

16:40.290 --> 16:43.794
I don't know what else to call it
but a pretty sweet deal.

16:44.753 --> 16:45.879
So what's it gonna be?

16:46.255 --> 16:47.339
You gonna sit there

16:47.673 --> 16:48.549
like an idiot

16:48.632 --> 16:49.550
doing nothing?

16:50.718 --> 16:52.177
Or are you gonna join Space Force

16:52.970 --> 16:54.221
and shoot for the stars?

16:56.140 --> 16:56.974
Thank you.

16:59.143 --> 17:00.185
Thank you.

17:04.189 --> 17:06.191
Thank you. Thanks for coming.

17:06.817 --> 17:08.819
-We're signing up, General.
-See you on the moon, gentlemen.

17:09.278 --> 17:10.571
-Hey.
-Hey, bug.

17:10.946 --> 17:12.740
I need $100.

17:13.073 --> 17:15.576
Bobby's taking me to the desert
for a pop-up concert.

17:15.659 --> 17:17.995
Absolutely not. Hello.

17:18.078 --> 17:20.289
Dad, it's fine.
Just, like, give me the money.

17:20.372 --> 17:21.248
Uh, no.

17:21.749 --> 17:22.624
Goodbye.

17:22.708 --> 17:24.460
Okay, but you know Bobby.
You work with him.

17:24.543 --> 17:26.253
I know him? Bobby who?

17:26.336 --> 17:27.588
Bobby Telatovich.

17:27.671 --> 17:28.672
Yuri?

17:28.964 --> 17:31.759
That's the Bobby that you've been seeing?
He's ten years older than you.

17:31.842 --> 17:33.177
Jesus Christ, Erin.

17:33.260 --> 17:34.636
Hello. Have a good day.

17:34.720 --> 17:35.554
He's very sweet.

17:35.637 --> 17:38.057
No, he's not. He is a bad, bad man.

17:38.140 --> 17:40.726
Well, it wasn't my idea
to move to this shithole.

17:40.809 --> 17:43.562
I never called this town a shithole.
It's a very fine town. Very fine.

17:43.645 --> 17:47.357
Well, I'm going with or without you,
and I guess if I have no money,

17:47.441 --> 17:49.568
I'll just be totally reliant on Bobby.

17:50.110 --> 17:52.029
Have to do whatever Bobby says.

17:52.654 --> 17:54.907
Don't play that game with me, Erin.
It's not going to work.

17:58.368 --> 17:59.620
I'll talk it over with Mommy.

18:00.079 --> 18:01.080
Thank you, General.

18:03.123 --> 18:03.957
Hello.

18:31.527 --> 18:32.528
How you doing?

18:32.611 --> 18:33.529
Okay.

18:33.987 --> 18:34.863
Yeah.

18:35.489 --> 18:37.741
-You eating all right?
-Oh, yeah. Yeah.

18:37.825 --> 18:40.035
They're letting me grow radishes
in a window box,

18:40.119 --> 18:42.579
and I can pretty much eat them
whenever I want.

18:42.663 --> 18:43.580
-Nice.
-Yeah.

18:43.664 --> 18:45.290
And there's this guard, Louise,

18:45.374 --> 18:47.501
she slips me some food sometimes.

18:48.752 --> 18:50.504
Well, you look-- You look great.

18:50.587 --> 18:51.630
Ugh.

18:52.673 --> 18:53.674
Mmm.

18:54.967 --> 18:57.386
I miss you. Very much.

18:58.971 --> 19:01.807
Mark, I'm gonna be in here a long time.

19:02.224 --> 19:03.851
So if you need...

19:04.810 --> 19:05.978
companionship--

19:06.061 --> 19:08.981
No. No. No!

19:09.106 --> 19:10.691
No. I am your husband.

19:11.191 --> 19:13.277
Yes, but I'll understand if you--

19:13.360 --> 19:15.696
Absolutely not.
I don't want you to bring this up again.

19:15.779 --> 19:16.613
Please.

19:18.198 --> 19:19.199
How's Erin?

19:21.702 --> 19:24.788
Erin wants to go to a concert
in the desert this weekend

19:24.872 --> 19:26.123
with this older Russian guy,

19:26.206 --> 19:28.167
who I think is just using her
to get information.

19:28.667 --> 19:30.919
Eighteen is that age
where you make mistakes

19:31.003 --> 19:32.504
and figure some things out.

19:32.588 --> 19:34.006
Do you think I should let her go?

19:34.089 --> 19:36.091
Well, I just don't know
how you can stop her.

19:37.259 --> 19:40.596
Louise says if you can't do anything
about a situation,

19:40.679 --> 19:42.931
you might as well lean back
and let it happen.

19:43.891 --> 19:44.850
Hmm.

19:45.225 --> 19:47.686
-Louise sounds like a good friend.
- Well...

19:55.319 --> 19:57.529
Oh, shoot. Gonna be late.

19:58.071 --> 19:59.907
Set me down next to the BX, please.

20:00.115 --> 20:02.159
Uh... I can't do that, sir.

20:02.242 --> 20:04.286
I have to land on the designated pad.

20:04.369 --> 20:06.914
I am telling you to do it,
so you can do it.

20:07.331 --> 20:10.042
I have a congressional delegation
down there waiting for me.

20:10.542 --> 20:12.544
Um, it's only another 100 yards, sir,

20:12.628 --> 20:14.713
and I'm sure you're gonna do great
with the delegation,

20:14.796 --> 20:16.173
even if you are a minute late.

20:24.473 --> 20:25.641
Thin ice, Captain.

20:26.099 --> 20:27.100
Thin ice.

20:34.149 --> 20:35.108
General Naird.

20:39.112 --> 20:40.864
Hey, General? General. A word.

20:40.948 --> 20:42.908
-I'm late for a meeting.
-I ran the numbers,

20:42.991 --> 20:45.202
and I can't put the bowling alley
under the cyclotron

20:45.285 --> 20:47.079
unless the bowling alley is curved,

20:47.162 --> 20:49.289
-and I don't see how that works.
-Get it done.

20:49.373 --> 20:52.042
-I have complete confidence in you, ma'am.
-Okay, it's Kelly.

20:52.125 --> 20:53.168
It's Kelly.

21:01.093 --> 21:03.553
-Oh. Nice of you to join us.
-My apologies.

21:03.637 --> 21:05.013
Had a little chopper trouble.

21:06.056 --> 21:07.349
So, uh, what's good here?

21:07.766 --> 21:09.601
I would recommend the tuna.

21:10.018 --> 21:11.061
Sushi?

21:11.144 --> 21:13.730
How much are taxpayers paying
to fly that in?

21:13.814 --> 21:14.773
A sandwich.

21:16.191 --> 21:17.985
I knew that. It was a joke.

21:18.068 --> 21:19.069
And a good one.

21:19.486 --> 21:20.904
But with a grain of truth.

21:20.988 --> 21:22.990
Kick Grabaston at Air Force
told us confidentially

21:23.073 --> 21:25.075
that this base
was a complete waste of money.

21:25.158 --> 21:28.161
Ladies and gentlemen,
I assure you we are on track,

21:28.245 --> 21:31.164
and Epsilon will launch at 1700 hours.

21:31.248 --> 21:33.375
And the Epsilon
is the new spacecraft fighter, right?

21:33.458 --> 21:34.334
That is correct.

21:34.418 --> 21:35.836
What kind of armament
will it have on board?

21:35.919 --> 21:37.296
Laser cannon? Pulse weapon?

21:38.213 --> 21:40.215
I believe those are from <i>Star Wars.</i>

21:40.799 --> 21:41.633
Yep.

21:42.050 --> 21:45.721
But if I had a laser cannon,

21:45.804 --> 21:48.890
I would probably use it
to cook a Wendy's hamburger.

21:56.481 --> 21:59.693
The Epsilon is equipped
with a kinetic disabling system.

22:00.360 --> 22:02.863
-Meaning?
<i>-</i>It can eject a metal net,

22:02.946 --> 22:06.074
and it is our hope
that we can get this net

22:06.158 --> 22:08.035
to tangle with enemy satellites.

22:08.118 --> 22:09.077
Exploding them?

22:09.953 --> 22:11.079
Tangling them.

22:11.747 --> 22:15.250
This better be
one fucking flawless launch.

22:15.334 --> 22:16.460
Six billion for a net.

22:16.835 --> 22:17.794
Not a good look.

22:17.878 --> 22:19.254
-Oh, sorry.

22:19.338 --> 22:20.213
Excuse me.

22:20.297 --> 22:22.257
Oh, God. I have to take this.

22:24.634 --> 22:25.969
Dad, is everything all right?

22:26.053 --> 22:28.096
Yeah, only your mom has run off again.

22:29.097 --> 22:31.058
I can't see her. I'd run after her,

22:31.141 --> 22:33.977
but I think I had a small heart attack
this morning.

22:34.061 --> 22:35.896
You know, I'm feeling a little draggy.

22:35.979 --> 22:38.982
Okay, Dad, is the caretaker there?
Please put the caretaker on.

22:39.066 --> 22:41.151
<i>He's on his way.</i>
<i>He should be here any minute.</i>

22:41.568 --> 22:43.737
So how's the lady situation?

22:43.820 --> 22:46.365
Well, as you know, my wife is in prison.

22:46.448 --> 22:48.909
Uh-huh.
You know what I had to do yesterday?

22:48.992 --> 22:51.411
I had to crawl under the house
to check a leak.

22:51.495 --> 22:52.996
No, Dad.<i> </i>Dad, don't do--

22:53.080 --> 22:55.582
We have people
to crawl under the house, Dad.

22:55.665 --> 22:58.585
I crawled under. I didn't tell anybody,
and they didn't know I was under there.

22:58.668 --> 23:00.379
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

23:00.462 --> 23:03.423
Please, Dad, don't, don't--
Don't crawl under the house!

23:03.507 --> 23:06.259
So how's things?
How's your-- How's your wife?

23:07.260 --> 23:08.136
She's fine.

23:08.220 --> 23:10.806
Yeah, you two
are gonna make a great couple.

23:11.640 --> 23:13.600
-Is the caretaker there, Dad?
-Uh, yeah.

23:13.683 --> 23:15.268
-What are you doing?
<i>-Put the caretaker on.</i>

23:15.352 --> 23:16.478
-Have to get in the house.
-What?

23:16.561 --> 23:17.979
<i>-Put the caretaker on.</i>
-Get in the house.

23:18.063 --> 23:19.189
He wants to talk to you.

23:19.272 --> 23:21.400
Oh, God. I don't know what to do.

23:21.483 --> 23:23.068
<i>Your father should be in the hospital.</i>

23:23.151 --> 23:25.612
Your mama is somewhere
in the streets in her nightgown.

23:25.695 --> 23:26.905
Can you come home and help me?

23:26.988 --> 23:29.783
I wish I could, Jean Baptiste,
but I'm having kind of a day of it myself.

23:29.866 --> 23:32.536
And, please, don't let my dad
go under the house again.

23:32.619 --> 23:34.621
I try. You know he do whatever he want.

23:34.704 --> 23:35.747
<i>-No, no, no, no!</i>
-Ask him...

23:35.831 --> 23:38.250
<i>You have to keep eyes on him.</i>
<i>Do you understand?</i>

23:38.333 --> 23:40.252
-Yes, Mr. Naird.
<i>-</i>Ask him how his wife is.

23:40.335 --> 23:42.003
-How is your wife?
<i>-Ugh, God.</i>

23:42.087 --> 23:43.880
<i>All right, hold on a second,</i>
<i>Jean Baptiste.</i>

23:44.464 --> 23:46.508
Brad, I'm going to need you
to task the satellite

23:46.591 --> 23:48.802
-over Nutley, New Jersey, again.
-Yes, I'm on it.

23:54.099 --> 23:55.892
She's in the Rite-Aid parking lot.

23:55.976 --> 23:58.728
<i>-Text me when she's in the car.</i>
<i>-</i>Okay. Thank you, Mr. Naird.

24:03.108 --> 24:05.485
Oh, he is blowing it
just like you thought.

24:06.153 --> 24:07.904
Yeah, it is a complete shit show.

24:08.447 --> 24:09.406
Oh!

24:09.489 --> 24:10.574
My dry cleaner.

24:10.657 --> 24:13.326
Yeah, yeah, they, uh,
they lost my dress whites.

24:22.377 --> 24:24.004
-I canceled the launch.

24:26.047 --> 24:27.966
Mallory's waiting for you.

24:28.049 --> 24:29.926
-He said not to say anything.
-Thank you, Brad.

24:30.469 --> 24:32.345
-I didn't say anything.
-Well done, Bradley.

24:32.429 --> 24:34.389
-Oh, thank you, sir.

24:34.473 --> 24:37.184
It's a six-billion-dollar decision.

24:37.267 --> 24:38.435
We can't risk it.

24:38.518 --> 24:40.187
It's a lot for a scientist,

24:40.270 --> 24:42.606
but in the military,
we have to risk lives.

24:42.939 --> 24:44.900
At 50 grand a year,

24:44.983 --> 24:50.489
it would take 120,000 years
to earn $6 billion.

24:50.572 --> 24:56.536
That is the entire lifetime earnings
of 3,000 people.

24:56.620 --> 25:01.833
Now, how many times can a country
waste the entire lifetime earnings

25:01.917 --> 25:07.297
of thousands of its citizens
without something really bad happening?

25:07.380 --> 25:09.508
Are you still upset
about the button covers?

25:10.091 --> 25:12.260
A thousand dollars
for a plastic button cover?

25:12.344 --> 25:13.553
That's insane!

25:14.179 --> 25:16.181
-So you think we'll be ready by Novem--

25:16.264 --> 25:17.974
-<i> Three.</i>

25:18.058 --> 25:19.768
<i>-Two.</i>
-Shit.

25:19.851 --> 25:20.685
<i>One.</i>

25:24.231 --> 25:25.065
Sorry.

25:25.148 --> 25:27.651
How many times do I need to apologize?

25:27.734 --> 25:31.321
Just come out to the launch site
and we'll show you.

25:31.404 --> 25:33.949
The proper humidity for launch
is 40 percent.

25:34.032 --> 25:36.910
Today it is at 54 percent.

25:36.993 --> 25:39.663
This can affect oxygenation and fuel burn.

25:39.746 --> 25:40.705
Mm-hmm.

25:40.789 --> 25:43.375
The amount of fuel measured
is very precise.

25:43.458 --> 25:44.501
If fuel is insufficient,

25:44.584 --> 25:46.962
the rocket returns to Earth
without reaching orbit.

25:47.045 --> 25:48.255
Where you from, Chan?

25:48.922 --> 25:50.840
-Ohio.
-Originally?

25:50.924 --> 25:52.968
What does that have to do with any-- Are--

25:53.093 --> 25:56.179
Are you suggesting Chan is a Chinese spy?

25:57.472 --> 26:01.268
Ah. So we have heard from Mr. Chan.

26:01.351 --> 26:03.019
-Doctor.
-Dr. Chan.

26:03.728 --> 26:05.272
I'd like to hear another opinion.

26:05.689 --> 26:08.692
Perhaps somebody willing
to dissent from the party line.

26:09.234 --> 26:12.070
Who'd like to give me a good reason
why we should launch today?

26:13.029 --> 26:13.863
Anyone?

26:16.283 --> 26:18.034
So I can weigh the pros and cons?

26:18.618 --> 26:21.371
Don't you have any mavericks
on your team, Mallory?

26:21.454 --> 26:23.290
-I say launch.
-Great.

26:23.373 --> 26:24.374
And you are Dr....

26:24.457 --> 26:25.709
Just call me Eddie.

26:25.792 --> 26:26.960
-Oh, shit.
-Ain't a doctor.

26:27.043 --> 26:28.628
I go to a bunch of 'em, though.

26:28.712 --> 26:31.339
Wonderful.
So those in favor of postponement

26:31.423 --> 26:33.967
are me and Dr. Chan, Dr. Swedberg,

26:34.050 --> 26:35.844
Dr. Bohr, Dr. Revredesh,

26:35.927 --> 26:38.179
Dr. Yamato, Dr. Lowenstein,

26:38.263 --> 26:40.557
Dr. Washington, and Dr. Zisk.

26:40.974 --> 26:43.685
In favor of launch are you and Eddie.

26:43.893 --> 26:45.353
Any last name, Eddie?

26:45.437 --> 26:46.896
None that I care to mention.

26:46.980 --> 26:47.981
Okay.

26:49.190 --> 26:50.692
Chan, what's behind your back?

26:51.192 --> 26:53.111
It's an umbrella, sir.

26:53.194 --> 26:55.614
Did you think it was a sword cane?
Samurai sword?

26:56.740 --> 26:58.992
Would you like to examine it, sir?

26:59.409 --> 27:00.869
No, we are done here.

27:01.620 --> 27:03.330
So the launch is scrubbed?

27:03.413 --> 27:05.665
I can't hear you over the rotors.

27:05.749 --> 27:07.417
-Well, this is absurd.

27:07.542 --> 27:09.085
So is this actually happening or not?

27:09.169 --> 27:10.920
There's no point if it's not happening...

27:11.004 --> 27:12.422
Excuse me, congresspeople.

27:12.505 --> 27:13.465
Brad...

27:14.591 --> 27:16.301
no interruptions for five minutes.

The launch is on.

29:08.955 --> 29:10.665
-What?
-See you at 1700.

29:10.749 --> 29:11.666
But you--

29:12.208 --> 29:14.210
Sheila? Yeah.

29:14.294 --> 29:16.755
Okay. Okay, okay. Okay. Okay.

29:17.839 --> 29:19.924
Don't, don't-- Please don't skitter away.

29:21.050 --> 29:22.886
Please, this is for your own safety.

29:23.136 --> 29:26.723
Come on. I'm trying to save you!
Damn it, come back here.

29:26.806 --> 29:30.852
Our country,
the oldest democracy in the world,

29:31.436 --> 29:33.104
put a man on the moon.

29:34.063 --> 29:37.734
It was perhaps our greatest moment
up until that point.

29:38.234 --> 29:41.696
Alongside the Constitution,
the Bill of Rights,

29:42.197 --> 29:44.657
and, of course, the Miracle on Ice.

29:45.074 --> 29:47.076
Today we launch Epsilon 6,

29:47.160 --> 29:50.538
a collaborative effort between
the scientists of the United States,

29:50.622 --> 29:53.458
Japan, Europe, Turkey, Israel, Australia,

29:53.541 --> 29:56.169
-and our old enemy, Russia.

29:56.252 --> 29:59.297
And this will bring us one step closer
to returning to the moon,

29:59.380 --> 30:01.549
and, from there, to Mars.

30:02.383 --> 30:04.969
There will be setbacks along the way.

30:05.720 --> 30:08.473
There are risks to every great endeavor.

30:09.557 --> 30:13.770
But greatness was never won
without suffering.

30:14.354 --> 30:15.522
And sacrifice.

30:17.148 --> 30:20.944
I am so, so damn proud of all of you.

30:21.027 --> 30:23.238
Oh, my God. He's really on the edge.

30:23.613 --> 30:25.573
So...

30:26.783 --> 30:28.284
without further ado,

30:29.828 --> 30:30.954
with this button,

30:31.788 --> 30:33.039
I so launch...

30:33.665 --> 30:35.124
Epsilon 6.

30:42.590 --> 30:44.801
-Liked the Miracle on Ice reference.
-Thank you, Brad.

31:07.323 --> 31:09.158
Aw. I should be tweeting this.

31:21.921 --> 31:22.964
Where'd it go?

31:27.176 --> 31:28.970
What's going on?
Did it blow up?

31:29.429 --> 31:30.388
Not yet.

31:34.225 --> 31:35.518
Epsilon 6 is in orbit.

32:01.878 --> 32:04.589
Yeah, well, he'll probably
have me transferred tomorrow

32:04.672 --> 32:06.633
once he has a moment to think about it.

32:07.300 --> 32:09.427
But what was I supposed to do?

32:09.510 --> 32:11.679
You put a helicopter down
in the wrong spot,

32:11.763 --> 32:13.848
and someone could get their head removed.

32:14.390 --> 32:15.642
Hang on a second, Mom.

32:21.773 --> 32:25.318
"Sorry I snapped at you.
Glad you're on our team."

32:38.539 --> 32:40.875
You know,
there's one thing that I don't get.

32:40.959 --> 32:42.877
You were right about the launch,

32:42.961 --> 32:45.964
yet you don't know anything about science.

32:49.300 --> 32:51.052
Guess I know a little about people.

32:53.012 --> 32:56.557
When we we're out at the launch site,
there were two tiny clouds in the sky.

32:57.058 --> 32:58.476
Chan had an umbrella.

32:59.686 --> 33:02.480
People like that can't handle
any risk at all.

33:02.981 --> 33:06.401
There's no way
we are getting back to the moon

33:06.484 --> 33:07.777
with that kind of thinking.

33:08.653 --> 33:11.155
That's a good observation. Well reasoned.

33:12.115 --> 33:13.116
Cheers.

33:13.533 --> 33:14.617
Thank you, Doctor.

33:18.746 --> 33:19.664
You know what?

33:20.039 --> 33:23.001
Epsilon should be passing right about now.

33:24.168 --> 33:25.920
-Do you see it?

33:26.671 --> 33:27.880
Eh...

33:27.964 --> 33:29.882
Oh, yeah, there's a spark.

33:30.967 --> 33:32.635
Beautiful. Wow.

33:36.097 --> 33:37.181
I got it.

33:37.974 --> 33:40.143
Wait, is that a second spark?
