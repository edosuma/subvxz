WEBVTT

00:03.173 --> 00:05.310
DJ Khaled!This week is
all about social media.

00:05.310 --> 00:06.948
We're gonna hit the
streets to film one another

00:06.948 --> 00:09.586
- <i>wearing lingerie.</i>
- Okay, let me record mine.

00:09.586 --> 00:12.291
Today's challenge
was a big hot mess.

00:12.291 --> 00:14.930
The winner
of this challenge is...

00:14.930 --> 00:17.969
- Courtney.
- What?

00:17.969 --> 00:19.540
- I was doing
everything for you...
- I tried to get you to speak.

00:19.540 --> 00:21.677
...Nothing, you stupid
( bleep ) ( bleep )!

00:21.677 --> 00:23.013
It's not just me,
this girl is frickin' crazy.

00:23.013 --> 00:24.650
I can't wait till you guys
get eliminated.

00:24.650 --> 00:28.056
Good luck with that.

00:28.056 --> 00:28.958
The model who gets
to stay this week...

00:28.958 --> 00:30.662
Coryanne.

00:30.662 --> 00:32.197
<i>♪♪♪</i>

01:15.885 --> 01:19.258
<i>♪♪♪</i>

01:19.258 --> 01:23.433
I should be
paying attention
to a lot of signs.

01:23.433 --> 01:25.204
I did a tarot card
like a few days ago.

01:25.204 --> 01:26.540
- How was it?
- It was crazy.

01:26.540 --> 01:28.677
It said--
I kid you not--

01:28.677 --> 01:30.582
it said
you're gonna go through
a period of isolation.

01:30.582 --> 01:32.418
Cody:
<i>My sister was eliminated
so unexpectedly,</i>

01:32.418 --> 01:34.255
I would love to give
people the tears that they want

01:34.255 --> 01:36.693
but I just can't.

01:36.693 --> 01:38.463
I can't do that right now,
because I have to focus,

01:38.463 --> 01:40.067
and I know that's what
she would want for me as well.

01:40.067 --> 01:41.938
I really have this time

01:41.938 --> 01:44.876
to really be by myself

01:44.876 --> 01:46.278
and just to
relax and, like--

01:46.278 --> 01:47.915
I'm so excited
for tomorrow, like...

01:47.915 --> 01:49.753
I just know
I'm gonna kill it.

01:49.753 --> 01:51.455
I wanna
continue to focus myself
and eventually

01:51.455 --> 01:53.594
I even wanna stop talking
about the twin thing,

01:53.594 --> 01:55.130
<i>because the closer you get,
the more real it is</i>

01:55.130 --> 01:57.903
<i>and I believe
I can win this.</i>

01:57.903 --> 01:59.606
Like yes,
it is a competition,
but at the same time,

01:59.606 --> 02:02.111
like, we are all
so different
from one another.

02:02.111 --> 02:04.215
So I got best photo
at this week's panel

02:04.215 --> 02:07.955
and I am so,
so excited.

02:07.955 --> 02:10.962
I'm not just the sexy girl
that they think I am.

02:10.962 --> 02:13.635
<i>Look,
I don't know, I thought
my pictures were dope.</i>

02:13.635 --> 02:15.939
Every single panel,
it's like they don't
say one nice thing.

02:15.939 --> 02:17.608
Coryanne:
<i>Last elimination I ended up
in the bottom two again.</i>

02:17.608 --> 02:20.447
So, I don't know
what to say.

02:20.447 --> 02:22.050
<i>I just have to just keep
pushing through.</i>

02:22.050 --> 02:23.453
<i>Like, I'm living here and
I'm bad at everything.</i>

02:23.453 --> 02:25.390
Everything, not one time
am I good at anything.

02:25.390 --> 02:28.063
Tatiana:
<i>Coryanne got saved again.</i>

02:28.063 --> 02:29.599
I'm like, "Damn, like,
well, how many chances
is she gonna get?"

02:29.599 --> 02:31.770
It's okay,
because America
loves an underdog.

02:31.770 --> 02:34.576
I'm about to come
backnhella strong.

02:34.576 --> 02:35.143
...I'm like,
"Is anyone gonna wanna work
with me after this?"

02:38.183 --> 02:41.122
Courtney.

02:41.122 --> 02:43.661
Yes!

02:43.661 --> 02:44.996
You brought
the first aid kit in here
and made a mess.

02:44.996 --> 02:47.769
Can you come
clean it up, baby?

02:47.769 --> 02:48.971
Wait, I didn't bring
the first aid kit in there.

02:48.971 --> 02:51.109
I don't know
where it goes.

02:51.109 --> 02:53.313
It's your fault
that it's there.

02:53.313 --> 02:55.150
Okay, but you couldjust
ask me nicely.

02:55.150 --> 02:57.288
I can't believe
you would even, like--

02:57.288 --> 02:58.691
Like, I get you're PMSing,
but, like, chill.

02:58.691 --> 03:01.597
<i>That's presumptuous,</i>

03:01.597 --> 03:03.266
and I'm actually just,
you know, sick of people.

03:03.266 --> 03:05.505
In my life outside
this competition,

03:05.505 --> 03:07.775
<i>I don't have tons and tons
of friends.</i>

03:07.775 --> 03:09.647
I like to be by myself,
so this is a living situation

03:09.647 --> 03:13.453
<i>that I'm totally
unfamiliar with</i>

03:13.453 --> 03:14.289
and it gets a little
frustrating for me.

03:14.289 --> 03:17.394
I'm done with whiners.

03:17.394 --> 03:18.397
I'm done with pity
parties, and it's driving me

03:18.397 --> 03:20.167
a little bit
freakin' nuts.

03:20.167 --> 03:21.035
<i>♪♪♪</i>

03:26.012 --> 03:29.786
- Law Roach:
<i>Hello, pussycat.</i>
- Hi.

03:29.786 --> 03:32.291
- Oh my... no way.
- <i>Who is that?</i>

03:32.291 --> 03:34.529
- Where's the other girls?
- <i>Everywhere.</i>

03:34.529 --> 03:36.667
Do you want me
to call 'em down?

03:36.667 --> 03:37.969
- Law: <i>Yeah.</i>
- Ladies!

03:37.969 --> 03:40.040
<i>We have a surprise.</i>

03:40.040 --> 03:42.211
Law just pops up
and I'm so excited.

03:42.211 --> 03:44.716
<i>In my head Law
is my bestie.</i>

03:44.716 --> 03:46.185
I mean, I feel like
we've kinda had chemistry
since the beginning,

03:46.185 --> 03:48.089
so I was super excited
that he came.

03:48.089 --> 03:50.260
- Hello, ladies.
- All: Hi.

03:50.260 --> 03:52.866
I wanted to come over
and hang out with you guys

03:52.866 --> 03:54.368
and just kinda talk
about the importance

03:54.368 --> 03:57.174
of personal style.

03:57.174 --> 03:59.245
Style in general
is such a big part

03:59.245 --> 04:01.215
of what's happening
with girls today, like,

04:01.215 --> 04:03.487
girls are becoming famous
just from street style.

04:03.487 --> 04:06.359
<i>Yeah,
we love red carpets,</i>

04:06.359 --> 04:07.729
but we also
wanna see, like,
what the girls

04:07.729 --> 04:09.265
are wearing when they're
walking down the street.

04:09.265 --> 04:10.100
<i>You know, like,
the Kardashians</i>

04:10.100 --> 04:12.371
<i>or Hailey Baldwin,</i>

04:12.371 --> 04:13.941
<i>or my girl Zendaya.</i>

04:13.941 --> 04:15.076
I don't have
very good style.

04:15.076 --> 04:18.584
I am from Texas

04:18.584 --> 04:20.354
<i>and I don't have money,
I don't have</i>

04:20.354 --> 04:21.890
<i>a lot of the things
that people have.</i>

04:21.890 --> 04:23.761
All my stuff is old...

04:23.761 --> 04:26.198
fashioned.

04:26.198 --> 04:28.102
It doesn't take
a lot of money

04:28.102 --> 04:29.104
<i>to figure out what
your personal style is.</i>

04:29.104 --> 04:31.509
<i>Like, for me,</i>

04:31.509 --> 04:33.012
I haven't always
been in the place
that I'm in now.

04:33.012 --> 04:35.017
But I've always knew
that style

04:35.017 --> 04:37.421
was one
of the important things

04:37.421 --> 04:39.225
in building my brand
and presenting myself.

04:39.225 --> 04:42.030
So I just wanna
kinda like,

04:42.030 --> 04:43.367
talk about, like,
your personal style

04:43.367 --> 04:44.603
and your
individual brands,
and, like,

04:44.603 --> 04:45.638
how do you see yourself?

04:48.309 --> 04:50.280
<i>I have my own skin care line
and meeting people,</i>

04:50.280 --> 04:52.985
<i>and networking
with different people,</i>

04:52.985 --> 04:54.656
<i>they look at my appearance
and they see that, "Oh,
okay.</i>

04:54.656 --> 04:56.292
<i>She looks put together,
so she must be successful."</i>

04:56.292 --> 04:58.931
I just like to always
let people know what I am.

04:58.931 --> 05:01.402
For me, Tati,
I think you have a very
strong idea

05:01.402 --> 05:04.108
of who and what you are,
so bravo.

05:04.108 --> 05:05.744
Who's next?

05:10.955 --> 05:15.798
Giah.

05:15.798 --> 05:17.434
Giah:
I love having
patchouli oil on.

05:17.434 --> 05:20.307
I don't get
that from you.

05:20.307 --> 05:21.643
<i>Like, I watch
you in panel</i>

05:21.643 --> 05:23.112
and I kinda like,
cringe a little bit.

05:23.112 --> 05:24.750
But that's okay.
That can be fixed.

05:24.750 --> 05:26.786
<i>I'm gonna
help you fix that.</i>

05:26.786 --> 05:28.590
- Miss Thing?
- I feel like
I'm an eclectic style,

05:28.590 --> 05:30.494
<i>like I love to experiment
with different things.</i>

05:30.494 --> 05:33.701
- I don't
agree with you.
- No?

05:33.701 --> 05:35.572
I have not seen anything
eclectic in panel.

05:35.572 --> 05:38.276
We have to come upwith
a different name for it.

05:38.276 --> 05:39.411
Sultry glam,
let's take that.

05:41.315 --> 05:42.585
So we have
one girl left.

05:42.585 --> 05:45.123
Just model eclectic,
I like that one.

05:45.123 --> 05:46.325
- What does that mean?
- Modelesque,

05:46.325 --> 05:48.363
but eclectic,
always different.

05:48.363 --> 05:49.866
<i>Like yesterday I had
the tie dye purple dress.</i>

05:49.866 --> 05:52.539
<i>The week before that
I had a baby doll top</i>

05:52.539 --> 05:54.275
<i>with a black/white
print and long skinny jeans.</i>

05:54.275 --> 05:56.379
- Okay.
- Do you remember
any of them?

05:56.379 --> 05:59.018
No.

05:59.018 --> 06:00.822
To be honest,
all the other girls,

06:00.822 --> 06:02.692
I can remember
what they had on in panel.

06:02.692 --> 06:05.798
Like, I can't remember
what you wore.

06:05.798 --> 06:08.203
Coryanne:
<i>I'm unmemorable?
Really?</i>

06:08.203 --> 06:10.340
I just don't know
how to relate to that,

06:10.340 --> 06:11.510
'cause I completely
don't agree.

06:11.510 --> 06:13.179
Now that we kinda identified

06:16.151 --> 06:18.289
<i>everyone's
personal style,</i>

06:18.289 --> 06:19.959
<i>your challenge
this week is to show me</i>

06:19.959 --> 06:22.064
<i>a clear definition
of your personal style,</i>

06:22.064 --> 06:24.201
<i>using your own clothes.</i>

06:24.201 --> 06:26.338
And it wouldn't be
a challenge

06:26.338 --> 06:28.376
if you had
a long time to do it.

06:28.376 --> 06:29.211
So girls,
you only have
15 minutes.

06:29.211 --> 06:31.048
Ready? Go.

06:34.354 --> 06:39.533
What color shirt
can I wear under this?

06:39.533 --> 06:41.069
<i>15 minutes to gather the
cutest thing we can find,</i>

06:41.069 --> 06:43.841
it's a very high
pressure situation.

06:43.841 --> 06:45.209
( bleep )

06:47.916 --> 06:50.855
I've actually worn
a lot of my amazing
outfits to panels,

06:50.855 --> 06:54.028
so I'm kinda nervous
that I don't have enough.

06:54.028 --> 06:56.366
Law:
<i>Okay girls, we're down
to five minutes.</i>

06:56.366 --> 06:58.069
I literally have so many
different styles of clothes.

07:00.207 --> 07:03.012
<i>I'm just stressed.</i>

07:03.012 --> 07:04.081
<i>Oh my God,
what do I pick?</i>

07:04.081 --> 07:04.749
Law:
<i>Two minutes.</i>

07:08.222 --> 07:08.724
My personal style
is sultry glam.

07:12.765 --> 07:15.204
<i>I'm very inspired
by Jennifer Lopez,</i>

07:15.204 --> 07:17.776
<i>who has a body
that I can relate to.</i>

07:17.776 --> 07:21.082
Ladies, your time is up.
Please, let's come down.

07:21.082 --> 07:24.690
- Let's go.
- We gotta go, we gotta go.

07:24.690 --> 07:26.425
Tatiana, you up first,
let me see what you got, boo.

07:26.425 --> 07:29.431
Okay, so I chose a outfit

07:29.431 --> 07:31.202
<i>that I can go straight,</i>

07:31.202 --> 07:32.438
like from the casting
to maybe the club.

07:32.438 --> 07:35.276
I always have
my yellow bag,

07:35.276 --> 07:36.613
'cause it's
a statement piece

07:36.613 --> 07:38.116
so I just feltlike
this really represents

07:38.116 --> 07:39.418
my personal style,
which is model chic.

07:39.418 --> 07:42.157
Can you just
give me a little
runway walk?

07:42.157 --> 07:43.426
- All right.
- Just so I get
the full look.

07:43.426 --> 07:45.263
Tatiana is fierce
competition.

07:47.168 --> 07:50.307
<i>She seems to like</i>

07:50.307 --> 07:51.744
( snaps fingers )
already have it in the bag,

07:51.744 --> 07:54.115
which is really annoying.

07:54.115 --> 07:55.985
Law:
<i>This is model chic.</i>

07:55.985 --> 07:57.822
You got it,
you nailed it.

07:57.822 --> 07:58.957
- Krislian.
- Sultry glam.

08:00.962 --> 08:01.395
Krislian.
Seriously?

08:05.738 --> 08:07.474
<i>If she doesn't want
to be called too sexy,</i>

08:07.474 --> 08:08.811
<i>she should
dress not sexy.</i>

08:08.811 --> 08:11.583
Ugh.

08:11.583 --> 08:12.619
Law:
<i>I definitely think</i>

08:12.619 --> 08:14.488
that you have
an aesthetic.

08:14.488 --> 08:15.958
<i>The sultry,
you got that.</i>

08:15.958 --> 08:17.662
<i>That's in your DNA.</i>

08:17.662 --> 08:19.265
You can't shake it,
it's not going anywhere.

08:19.265 --> 08:20.768
<i>But some of it,
it just needs to be</i>

08:20.768 --> 08:22.772
a little bit more classy.

08:22.772 --> 08:24.341
<i>We've seen
this girl before.</i>

08:24.341 --> 08:27.013
We see this girl
all over social media.

08:27.013 --> 08:28.349
It's the same girl,
in the same dress

08:28.349 --> 08:30.521
<i>headed to the club.</i>

08:30.521 --> 08:31.824
And I don't know
if you wanna get
stuck in that.

08:31.824 --> 08:34.796
I am shorter,
so my conflict is,

08:34.796 --> 08:37.502
like if I wearlike loose stuff,

08:37.502 --> 08:38.671
then I'm like,
I feel like I look
even smaller.

08:38.671 --> 08:40.273
Um...

08:42.678 --> 08:44.314
I just never know where
I stand in this competition.

08:44.314 --> 08:47.354
You say it
all the time, like,

08:47.354 --> 08:48.624
<i>"I'm one of
the shortest girls,"</i>

08:48.624 --> 08:51.061
but this doesn't
make you look tall.

08:51.061 --> 08:53.066
You wanna be like
the girls who do "Maxim,"
but they also do "Vogue."

08:53.066 --> 08:55.838
<i>But where you at now,
you're only gonna be
in "Maxim."</i>

08:55.838 --> 08:58.209
If you tell me something,
you have to prove it to me.

08:58.209 --> 09:01.282
Because now,
you lied to me.

09:01.282 --> 09:04.020
Giah:
These were not
typical heels,

09:04.020 --> 09:05.223
they were like,
on steroids.

09:05.223 --> 09:06.693

27:59.323 --> 28:00.594
<i>and very cinematic
and theatrical,</i>

28:00.594 --> 28:03.098
but the other pictures
you don't even wanna see.

28:03.098 --> 28:06.538
You were lost in every
single picture.

28:06.538 --> 28:09.476
It's kind of a
disappointment because we all so
in love

28:09.476 --> 28:11.515
with what you did last week
and now we're like,

28:11.515 --> 28:13.217
"Maybe we... spoke too soon."

28:13.217 --> 28:16.457
I understand.

28:16.457 --> 28:18.963
Okay, next up.
Binta.

28:18.963 --> 28:22.303
<i>It's a beautiful photograph,
I mean, the angle, your
face.</i>

28:22.303 --> 28:25.108
<i>You just look like
someone dropped you in</i>

28:25.108 --> 28:26.712
from a fantasy land
into real life.

28:26.712 --> 28:29.217
Ashley:
Every photo of you
is exquisite.

28:29.217 --> 28:31.054
You're an editorial
fashion girl.

28:31.054 --> 28:32.858
Thank you.

28:32.858 --> 28:35.395
<i>Paige.</i>

28:35.395 --> 28:36.532
Hi, sunshine.
You're always smiling.
That's always a good thing.

28:36.532 --> 28:39.872
Cool.

28:39.872 --> 28:41.340
Let's look at the photo.

28:41.340 --> 28:43.144
- Drew: <i>Fab.</i>
- Rita: That's fab.

28:43.144 --> 28:44.715
You're this sexy
Britney Spears bride

28:44.715 --> 28:48.522
in the meat department.

28:48.522 --> 28:49.825
Each time, you just
elevate it, elevate it,
elevate it.

28:49.825 --> 28:53.164
<i>You haven't stayed
one-dimensional.</i>

28:53.164 --> 28:54.568
<i>You're changing
into editorial.</i>

28:54.568 --> 28:55.737
<i>You're understanding
your look.</i>

28:55.737 --> 28:57.473
I think it's fantastic.

28:57.473 --> 28:57.974
<i>- Good job.</i>
- Thank you so much.

28:57.974 --> 29:00.981
Cody.

29:00.981 --> 29:02.884
Should we take a look
at your picture?

29:02.884 --> 29:04.755
<i>( whistle )</i>

29:04.755 --> 29:06.224
Rita:
<i>I just got goose bumps.</i>

29:06.224 --> 29:09.097
So fabulous.

29:09.097 --> 29:11.434
Law:
<i>This is amazing.</i>

29:11.434 --> 29:13.371
Like, I wanna look at it
forever and ever and ever.

29:13.371 --> 29:15.341
- You know what I mean?
- <i>Yes.</i>

29:15.341 --> 29:16.177
And one thing I wanna ask
is what's it like in the house

29:16.177 --> 29:19.217
without Tash?

29:19.217 --> 29:20.753
A lot of my life
I've kinda ran away

29:20.753 --> 29:23.793
from the whole twin thing.

29:23.793 --> 29:25.462
<i>I just wanted to be
my own person</i>

29:25.462 --> 29:27.300
and I think my sister
was offended

29:27.300 --> 29:28.803
and I just feel like now
I can kinda prove to her

29:28.803 --> 29:31.675
that me being
an individual

29:31.675 --> 29:33.078
does not make us
any less of twins.

29:33.078 --> 29:34.347
I feel like
your confidence level

29:34.347 --> 29:35.950
has risen
since she's gone.

29:35.950 --> 29:38.789
Separating you guys, I think,

29:38.789 --> 29:40.694
it's the best thing that
happened for you, honestly.

29:40.694 --> 29:43.031
<i>This is the best photo
I've ever seen of you.</i>

29:43.031 --> 29:46.037
I'm in love with
your female side.

29:46.037 --> 29:48.709
I'm in love with
your masculine side.

29:48.709 --> 29:51.715
That's a face of a boss.

29:51.715 --> 29:54.053
That is like someone
that is here to take over.

29:54.053 --> 29:57.159
Every single frame
is perfect.

29:57.159 --> 29:59.163
<i>I mean, Nicola said,</i>

29:59.163 --> 29:59.964
"It's kind of one
of my best editorials

29:59.964 --> 30:02.402
I've ever done."

30:02.402 --> 30:03.238
Can you say that,
"I did a great job?"

30:03.238 --> 30:05.308
I did a great job.

30:05.308 --> 30:06.311
Can you say,
"I did a great ( bleep )...!"

30:06.311 --> 30:07.781
I did a great ( bleep ) job!

30:07.781 --> 30:09.083
Yeah!

30:09.083 --> 30:11.421
Giah.

30:11.421 --> 30:13.257
This is the most
beautiful and elegant

30:13.257 --> 30:15.763
that you have looked
in any gown.

30:15.763 --> 30:17.667
- <i>You look amazing.</i>
- Thank you.

30:17.667 --> 30:20.239
Let's look at the photo.

30:20.239 --> 30:22.409
- Drew: <i>This was a tough
shoot for you.</i>
- Yeah.

30:22.409 --> 30:24.648
I posed you in every
single shot that you did.

30:24.648 --> 30:26.752
<i>And I think as you
were sitting there,</i>

30:26.752 --> 30:28.822
<i>I just realized</i>

30:28.822 --> 30:30.025
<i>this is a very
beautiful woman.</i>

30:30.025 --> 30:32.463
This isn't a model.

30:32.463 --> 30:34.768
I didn't come
into this industry
as a supermodel.

30:34.768 --> 30:37.440
I came into this industry
as a musician, entertainer

30:37.440 --> 30:41.247
and so, I don't think
you have to necessarily be

30:41.247 --> 30:44.353
just a supermodel.

30:44.353 --> 30:45.957
<i>I can see that you have
a lot of things to give.</i>

30:45.957 --> 30:48.863
<i>But I do think you have
to be able to do it all</i>

30:48.863 --> 30:51.034
and this wasn't
doing it all.

30:51.034 --> 30:54.474
Thanks.

30:54.474 --> 30:56.477
Giah, dear, my love, I
just wanna hold you in my bosom

30:56.477 --> 30:59.884
and make sure that
everything's okay with you.

30:59.884 --> 31:03.458
Ashley:
<i>This is where you learn.</i>

31:03.458 --> 31:04.995
Every time you've come up here,
you've taken it in,

31:04.995 --> 31:07.033
you've brought it back
to the house,

31:07.033 --> 31:08.569
you've worked on it,
and you know what?

31:08.569 --> 31:10.105
Not every time you're gonna
be an avant-garde model.

31:10.105 --> 31:12.544
And that's okay.
But there's gotta be a way

31:12.544 --> 31:14.514
<i>you can fake it
a little bit.</i>

31:14.514 --> 31:15.616
- Thank you, Giah.
- Thank you, guys.

31:15.616 --> 31:18.354
Marissa.

31:18.354 --> 31:19.290
<i>- Oh, wow!
- Fab!</i>

31:19.290 --> 31:20.660
Fun, young, your age.

31:20.660 --> 31:23.465
I wanna be your friend.

31:23.465 --> 31:25.135
- Let's be friends.
- <i>You really are fun.</i>

31:25.135 --> 31:27.339
And sometimes it's hard
for people's personality

31:27.339 --> 31:30.012
<i>to come across
in their work.</i>

31:30.012 --> 31:31.648
<i>And for you, I don't know if
it's the concept of the
shoot</i>

31:31.648 --> 31:33.318
but it really worked
in your favor this week.

31:33.318 --> 31:34.687
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

31:34.687 --> 31:36.090
- Thank you.
- Good job, Marissa.

31:36.090 --> 31:37.693
<i>Courtney.</i>

31:37.693 --> 31:41.000
<i>Wow.</i>

31:41.000 --> 31:42.870
Law:
One thing that we cannot deny
is that mother has a face.

31:42.870 --> 31:46.511
- Like you were born
to do this.
- Thank you.

31:46.511 --> 31:49.317
- This was your shoot.
- This was my shoot.

31:49.317 --> 31:51.487
<i>This was fantastic.
I'm blown away every
single week by you.</i>

31:51.487 --> 31:54.160
- Thank you.
- But I don't get
warm fuzzies from you.

31:54.160 --> 31:56.599
- <i>I don't know what it
is...</i> - I think...

31:56.599 --> 31:58.401
- Hold on, I'm still
talking. - Okay, I'm sorry.

31:58.401 --> 32:00.606
I just don't know
if I really like you.

32:00.606 --> 32:02.710
And I want to because
you kill it every single week.

32:02.710 --> 32:06.183
I know you're the one
that sometimes causes
a little bit of drama.

32:06.183 --> 32:09.457
It's difficult for me
living in the house

32:09.457 --> 32:11.227
with so many different girls
because it's hard for me

32:11.227 --> 32:15.301
to connect with people.

32:15.301 --> 32:16.939
I'm going to say it,
because I say it every time.

32:16.939 --> 32:19.009
You complain
like no one's business.

32:19.009 --> 32:22.684
<i>You have to stop it.</i>

32:22.684 --> 32:24.687
Don't mess this up.

32:24.687 --> 32:27.225
<i>You are amazing
and talented</i>

32:27.225 --> 32:30.799
but you could just lose
it for yourself here

32:30.799 --> 32:33.806
<i>and at these shoots and
with these amazing people</i>

32:33.806 --> 32:36.979
that are here for you,
and if you don't fix that,

32:36.979 --> 32:39.250
I will make sure
that you won't be here.

32:39.250 --> 32:41.755
- 100%.
- Okay? That's enough.

32:41.755 --> 32:44.561
- <i>Thank you.</i>
- Thank you.

32:44.561 --> 32:47.500
Coryanne.

32:47.500 --> 32:48.301
<i>Let's have a look
at your photo.</i>

32:48.301 --> 32:49.771
<i>( cheering )</i>

32:49.771 --> 32:53.144
What?

32:53.144 --> 32:55.048
What? What? Ah!

32:55.048 --> 32:58.154
Law:
You are a god
in this photo.

32:58.154 --> 33:00.458
Can I just say, that is
a true definition of a boss.

33:00.458 --> 33:04.400
<i>You really need to look
at that picture and say,</i>

33:04.400 --> 33:06.505
"No way am I sat
in that bottom two,"
'cause, to be honest,

33:06.505 --> 33:07.773
I'm sick and tired
of seeing your face
in that bottom two.

33:07.773 --> 33:10.245
This shows that.

33:10.245 --> 33:11.848
Your personality is coming
through a little bit more,

33:11.848 --> 33:14.788
and you seem a little bit
more comfortable and confident.

33:14.788 --> 33:17.092
And after this, you should have
no problems with confidence.

33:17.092 --> 33:20.265
Like, this is... amazing.

33:20.265 --> 33:22.804
Oh, that means so much.

33:22.804 --> 33:24.975
Next up,
Tatiana.

33:24.975 --> 33:27.747
<i>- Ooh.
- Wow.</i>

33:27.747 --> 33:29.518
- Drew: <i>Really fabulous.</i>
- Ashley:Your waist
looks skin-ny.

33:29.518 --> 33:32.690
Tatiana, you are the look,
you are the brains,

33:32.690 --> 33:36.497
you are the business.

33:36.497 --> 33:37.366
<i>You got the lotion line
already set up.</i>

33:37.366 --> 33:39.604
<i>Your style is on point.</i>

33:39.604 --> 33:41.775
- I believe in you.
- Thank you.

33:41.775 --> 33:43.946
You're definitely
a contender in this

33:43.946 --> 33:45.382
and I'm definitely having
lots of fun with you,

33:45.382 --> 33:47.186
but there's
a lot more to sculpt.

33:47.186 --> 33:49.691
- Yeah.
- Last up, Kyle.

33:49.691 --> 33:52.295
Let's look at her photo.

33:52.295 --> 33:54.466
Drew:
I think that you are
very, very consistent.

33:54.466 --> 33:57.106
I feel very comfortable
in the character of Kyle.

33:57.106 --> 34:00.011
What I want you to do
is expand the Kyle brand

34:00.011 --> 34:02.951
into something
that is going to shock us.

34:02.951 --> 34:05.388
I just think out of all
the girls, she has it
the easiest.

34:05.388 --> 34:08.061
<i>Like, she really doesn't
put in a lot of effort.</i>

34:08.061 --> 34:10.132
I mean, cause you have
the most distinctive look.

34:10.132 --> 34:12.870
I just don't feel it.
I don't feel you.

34:12.870 --> 34:15.308
I'm starting to have a problem
slightly with your attitude,

34:15.308 --> 34:18.582
just the way you stand
and you present yourself

34:18.582 --> 34:20.318
is almost like...
disrespectful in a way.

34:20.318 --> 34:23.191
This competition this year
isn't just about a model.

34:23.191 --> 34:26.030
Like we're looking
for a model and a mogul

34:26.030 --> 34:27.366
and I don't know
if the mogul part of it,

34:27.366 --> 34:29.169
if you have that in you.

34:29.169 --> 34:30.338
Thanks, guys.

34:31.975 --> 34:34.146
Okay, models.

34:34.146 --> 34:36.819
<i>Now we'll have
a little chat</i>

34:36.819 --> 34:38.254
to decide who'll be
getting best photo

34:38.254 --> 34:39.323
and who'll be packing up
and leaving.

34:51.582 --> 34:55.388
<i>♪♪♪</i>

34:55.388 --> 34:57.593
First up, let's talk
about Courtney.

34:57.593 --> 34:59.531
Ashley:
<i>I don't like
her personality.</i>

34:59.531 --> 35:01.233
I would not want
to work with her.

35:01.233 --> 35:02.771
I don't know if I want her
out in the industry--

35:02.771 --> 35:06.679
As our first brand
new Next Top Model.

35:06.679 --> 35:08.448
Yeah, it will
come back to us.

35:08.448 --> 35:10.586
Okay, Giah.

35:10.586 --> 35:12.222
Honestly, I don't see
Giah ever giving us

35:12.222 --> 35:15.930
what we're looking for
as a model in this competition.

35:15.930 --> 35:18.468
There was a moment
where I agreed with you

35:18.468 --> 35:20.739
but then I
think to myself,

35:20.739 --> 35:22.643
"Do I wanna give up
on her just yet?"

35:22.643 --> 35:24.246
<i>Krislian.
She's not timeless to me.</i>

35:24.246 --> 35:26.619
I'm not going to book her

35:26.619 --> 35:28.287
to front my Rimmel London
collection.

35:28.287 --> 35:29.958
We're judging this
from a high fashion
perspective,

35:29.958 --> 35:33.498
<i>but maybe
it's not about that.</i>

35:33.498 --> 35:34.968
Brands do live in
those social spaces

35:34.968 --> 35:38.441
and those are huge,
huge businesses.

35:38.441 --> 35:41.480
- Law: <i>Kyle.</i> - Ashley:
She has like a chip on her
shoulder.

35:41.480 --> 35:43.986
She will be thrown
to the side

35:43.986 --> 35:45.723
if she does not fix
her attitude.

35:45.723 --> 35:48.663
Yes.

35:48.663 --> 35:50.566
There's so many things
I haven't figured out

35:50.566 --> 35:51.936
- about myself yet. -
<i>Yeah, but you do have
time.</i>

35:51.936 --> 35:53.605
<i>Show them that
they're wrong about.</i>

35:56.578 --> 35:57.847
I'm not upset because him
getting that heated

35:57.847 --> 36:00.586
means that he really
believes in me,

36:00.586 --> 36:01.955
and that was, like, passion.

36:05.128 --> 36:10.171
Models, welcome back.
The judges have deliberated.

36:10.171 --> 36:13.277
If I call your name,
you're gonna stay
another week

36:13.277 --> 36:16.484
to prove you have what it
takes to be the Next Top Model.

36:16.484 --> 36:19.089
The first name I call
will have best photo.

36:21.461 --> 36:22.028
Coryanne.

36:25.870 --> 36:26.838
- Good work.
- Thank you.

The next name I'm gonna call...

37:13.398 --> 37:16.871
is...

37:19.409 --> 37:23.886
I think we're making
a mistake for a second.

37:23.886 --> 37:26.390
No, no, we're not,
we talked about it.

37:26.390 --> 37:29.931
- Drew: I agree.
- No. Yeah, I think
we should stop

37:29.931 --> 37:32.737
for one second.

37:32.737 --> 37:33.538
<i>I think we're making
a mistake.</i>

37:36.377 --> 37:36.878
I just don't think
it's fair.

37:40.887 --> 37:43.692
- You can build
someone's social brand.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

37:49.436 --> 37:52.943
Just, like,
majority rules.

37:54.580 --> 37:54.747
Oh, (bleep ).

38:01.093 --> 38:04.634
Uh.
All right.

38:05.936 --> 38:06.804
Here we go.

38:09.978 --> 38:12.550
So sorry.

38:12.550 --> 38:12.883
The next name
I'm going to call is...

38:16.290 --> 38:17.125
Krislian.

38:20.999 --> 38:22.135
Can you come here
for a second?

38:25.743 --> 38:26.611
The reason why
it was so difficult

38:29.784 --> 38:31.621
for me to put you through,
is because we're at a point

38:31.621 --> 38:35.294
in this competition where
one failure is so crucial

38:35.294 --> 38:38.468
to our decision making
because these girls
are no joke.

38:38.468 --> 38:42.576
This show is no joke.

38:42.576 --> 38:43.946
You just gotta
kill me next week.

38:43.946 --> 38:46.150
I will. This means
everything to me.

38:46.150 --> 38:49.155
Thank you.

38:49.155 --> 38:49.624
( sighs )
Kyle and Giah,
can you please step forward?

38:57.172 --> 39:01.914
Obviously, this has been
a very hard decision,

39:01.914 --> 39:04.587
and we're not
all in agreement.

39:05.656 --> 39:06.658
Kyle, you have
a distinctive edge

39:10.365 --> 39:12.837
<i>that should give you
an advantage</i>

39:12.837 --> 39:14.006
in this competition,
but you can't just rely

39:14.006 --> 39:17.012
on a cool look
to be a boss.

39:17.012 --> 39:18.849
You really have
to command the room
with your personality.

39:18.849 --> 39:21.521
Giah, your personality
is what we're looking for
in a boss.

39:23.825 --> 39:26.029
We loved watching you
transform,

39:28.535 --> 39:31.173
<i>but the judges
are worried</i>

39:31.173 --> 39:32.777
<i>that you're just not
nailing your photos.</i>

39:32.777 --> 39:35.481
Can you catch up
to the other girls?

39:35.481 --> 39:37.519
Yes, I want to.
I'm gonna practice.

39:37.519 --> 39:39.690
<i>So, who stays
and who goes?</i>

39:45.034 --> 39:49.845
Congratulations.

39:49.845 --> 39:50.812
<i>Kyle, you made it
another week,</i>

39:53.886 --> 39:56.356
and you still have the
chance to be the Next Top Model.

39:56.356 --> 39:58.828
Thank you, guys.

39:58.828 --> 39:59.563
Please go join
the other girls.

40:01.066 --> 40:01.534
Giah, I'm sorry,

40:05.575 --> 40:09.082
but you have to remember
what I said.

40:09.082 --> 40:10.653
You have made
the biggest transformation

40:10.653 --> 40:13.859
of all the girls,

40:13.859 --> 40:15.495
and you have shown
so much poise

40:15.495 --> 40:18.067
and you are such a lady.

40:18.067 --> 40:19.269
I don't believe
this will be the end for you.

40:19.269 --> 40:23.411
Okay?
All right?

40:23.411 --> 40:24.012
Giah:
<i>Modeling has always been
a dream for me,</i>

40:27.119 --> 40:29.757
<i>but I just didn't feel
confident off the top.</i>

40:29.757 --> 40:32.763
So to even get on the show
is just a blessing.

40:32.763 --> 40:35.536
<i>And I would have just
beenthis Texas girl talking
country</i>

40:35.536 --> 40:38.273
<i>and never going to college
and never doing anything.</i>

40:38.273 --> 40:41.515
Like, I know God is showing me
that I can be something

40:41.515 --> 40:44.453
even if I don't believe it
all the way.

40:44.453 --> 40:47.192
Love ya'll.

40:47.192 --> 40:47.626
Thank you so much
for the opportunity.

41:00.217 --> 41:00.986
I wanted to introduce you
to a dear friend of mine...

41:00.986 --> 41:02.790
( all screaming )

41:02.790 --> 41:03.992
Hi, ladies.

41:03.992 --> 41:05.428
Chanel Iman.

41:05.428 --> 41:06.931
This is the winning team
over here.

41:09.302 --> 41:11.039
<i>Marissa is really
hot and really distracting.</i>

41:11.039 --> 41:13.812
I definitely do want
to get closer to her.

41:13.812 --> 41:14.980
- Have you been cleaning
this bathroom? - <i>Yes,
literally every day.</i>

41:17.753 --> 41:20.058
Y'all didn't do ( bleep ).

41:20.058 --> 41:20.959
I don't wanna talk
about it... Shut up!

41:20.959 --> 41:23.397
You shut the ( bleep ) up.

41:23.397 --> 41:24.667
I really, honestly feel
like she was trying to
antagonize me.

41:24.667 --> 41:26.470
- <i>Shut up!</i>
- Bite my ass, bitch.

41:26.470 --> 41:27.305
You have no boobs
so shut the ( bleep ) up.

41:29.610 --> 41:30.177
<i>We see your beauty.</i>
