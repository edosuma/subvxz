WEBVTT

00:59.559 --> 01:00.643
What?

01:01.019 --> 01:02.103
What is it?

01:05.106 --> 01:06.316
Are you sleeping?

01:07.275 --> 01:09.444
-Oh my gosh!
-Have you lost your mind?

01:11.905 --> 01:14.657
I must have lost my mind.

01:30.507 --> 01:34.260
EPISODE 5
WAVERING HEART #FirstLove

02:11.131 --> 02:12.882
JONG-YEOUL YOON

02:12.966 --> 02:14.008
No.

02:14.092 --> 02:18.596
Are you sleeping?

02:18.763 --> 02:21.141
No!

02:30.150 --> 02:31.734
JONG-YEOUL YOON
Are you sleeping?

02:41.369 --> 02:42.537
Look at this for me.

02:43.413 --> 02:44.873
What do you think of them?

02:54.382 --> 02:55.508
It's fun.

02:55.967 --> 02:58.303
-Really?
-Is it a comedy?

02:59.429 --> 03:00.889
Isn't this them?

03:01.764 --> 03:03.725
That...

03:04.726 --> 03:07.478
That... No? Is it folk music?

03:13.610 --> 03:15.653
Watch what you say when you drink,

03:16.154 --> 03:19.115
because you will always regret it.

03:19.198 --> 03:22.076
Is there a way to delete this?
He didn't see it yet.

03:22.493 --> 03:23.870
-No.
-No.

03:24.037 --> 03:26.080
-No.
-There is.

03:30.710 --> 03:32.879
-You know where he lives, right?
-Yes.

03:32.962 --> 03:34.756
Sneak into his house.

03:34.839 --> 03:36.507
Steal his cell phone.

03:36.591 --> 03:38.635
Delete your text. Perfect, right?

03:44.974 --> 03:46.559
Why did I do that?

03:47.560 --> 03:49.562
Why did I do that?

03:50.521 --> 03:51.814
I repeat.

03:51.898 --> 03:55.944
There are ten things
you should never say when you're drunk...

03:56.027 --> 03:57.278
Be quiet!

04:02.158 --> 04:05.203
It's fine. Everyone does that
at least once when they're drunk.

04:05.870 --> 04:09.332
-Have you done that too?
-No.

04:09.832 --> 04:11.000
I have.

04:11.084 --> 04:13.503
Should I write "haha," like I was joking?

04:13.920 --> 04:15.255
-No.
-Don't.

04:15.338 --> 04:16.506
That's weirder.

04:16.965 --> 04:19.384
Why? I think it's okay.

04:23.680 --> 04:25.181
She never listens to me.

04:34.065 --> 04:35.900
JONG-YEOUL YOON
Are you sleeping?

04:44.784 --> 04:46.160
JONG-YEOUL YOON
Are you sleeping?

04:46.911 --> 04:50.164
What is he doing? Why won't he read it?

04:50.248 --> 04:52.583
He may have read it and is pretending.

04:53.501 --> 04:55.336
-Really?
-You didn't know?

04:55.420 --> 04:57.463
He can preview it and not open the app.

04:58.131 --> 05:00.133
Doesn't everyone who dates know that?

05:01.217 --> 05:02.260
Really?

05:03.261 --> 05:06.681
How did you know that, General Cho?
You're not dating.

05:07.432 --> 05:11.311
That's how I read Ye-ji's texts
when I don't want to respond.

05:14.564 --> 05:16.232
Maybe he's really ignoring me.

05:25.033 --> 05:26.617
Hot.

05:46.012 --> 05:48.639
Then why did he say he liked me?
He said he liked me first.

05:48.723 --> 05:50.433
He said he would love me forever!

06:01.069 --> 06:03.446
Why aren't you checking
your text messages?

06:03.529 --> 06:05.573
Are you pretending not to read it?

06:09.744 --> 06:11.954
YE-JI AHN

06:13.664 --> 06:15.750
Sorry. I was washing up.

06:29.222 --> 06:30.473
Am I that hot?

06:33.142 --> 06:35.436
You'll look shorter
if your muscles get bigger.

06:35.937 --> 06:37.480
-Hey!
-What?

06:38.272 --> 06:39.524
Where are you going?

06:40.191 --> 06:42.485
-Why are you being rude?
-You are too.

06:43.444 --> 06:45.446
Are you going to see that drunkard?

06:47.990 --> 06:49.700
-Are you two dating?
-What?

06:49.784 --> 06:51.702
You hear that a lot, don't you?

06:52.286 --> 06:53.746
Why do you care?

06:53.830 --> 06:56.707
You're right. Why do I care?

06:56.791 --> 06:57.708
Freak.

07:02.630 --> 07:04.841
-Are you interested in her?
-What?

07:04.924 --> 07:07.009
Dream on. She likes tall guys.

07:09.679 --> 07:11.472
Not tall people?

07:19.355 --> 07:21.190
Shoot.

07:24.652 --> 07:26.320
Right? Aren't they similar?

07:32.410 --> 07:35.913
But they're just scribbles.
Don't they all look alike?

07:35.997 --> 07:38.583
Do you do this when you're mad?
Write things like this?

07:38.666 --> 07:39.709
No.

07:40.042 --> 07:41.502
I don't either.

07:42.879 --> 07:44.130
So what you mean is,

07:44.213 --> 07:46.924
the person who lives there
isn't the recipient,

07:47.008 --> 07:48.718
-but the author?
-Yes.

07:50.052 --> 07:54.056
From what I've seen,
they're not such bad people.

07:54.348 --> 07:55.892
Not enough to get this.

07:58.311 --> 08:01.063
Isn't the person who wrote it
just as weird?

08:02.732 --> 08:05.651
She wrote it spontaneously
because she was angry.

08:06.444 --> 08:10.406
See? You just don't want them
to be bad people.

08:13.951 --> 08:15.119
You.

08:16.537 --> 08:18.122
You can't hate anyone, can you?

08:20.666 --> 08:22.919
Your dad, or your housemates.

08:23.753 --> 08:25.713
You just pretend to hate them.

08:27.256 --> 08:28.216
Right?

08:42.855 --> 08:44.815
Ji-won, is this yours?

08:45.316 --> 08:47.318
Wow. No.

08:48.152 --> 08:52.156
Jin-myung, did you get it
since you got a job? With the chef...

08:53.241 --> 08:54.158
It isn't mine.

08:56.160 --> 08:57.328
It isn't Eun-jae's style.

08:58.663 --> 08:59.705
General Cho.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.750
That's what she wore under her armor?

09:02.833 --> 09:03.793
No way.

09:04.377 --> 09:07.922
Why not? It's a world in which
Jin-myung does baby-talk.

09:08.005 --> 09:09.298
Shut it.

09:10.091 --> 09:12.426
Maybe Yi-na left it last time
she was here.

09:15.429 --> 09:16.973
What now?

09:17.056 --> 09:19.642
The one just disappeared. It's gone.

09:21.978 --> 09:25.439
JONG-YEOUL YOON
Are you sleeping?

09:27.900 --> 09:30.278
-He's ignoring you.
-He's ignoring you.

09:36.284 --> 09:38.911
What if he thinks I'm not over him?

09:39.245 --> 09:41.872
-You're not.
-I am.

09:42.123 --> 09:44.792
-I don't think you are.
-I am.

09:44.875 --> 09:48.129
-No, you're not.
-I am!

09:52.174 --> 09:54.093
Why is she taking it out on me?

09:54.176 --> 09:55.886
JONG-YEOUL YOON
Are you sleeping?

10:04.103 --> 10:06.647
EUN-JAE YOO
Are you sleeping?

10:12.028 --> 10:15.656
Why?

10:21.621 --> 10:26.417
Is something wrong?

10:33.507 --> 10:34.508
Mom, I'm hungry.

10:36.344 --> 10:38.679
"I meant to send it to my mom.

10:38.846 --> 10:41.432
I sent the text by mistake."

10:44.018 --> 10:46.062
"I meant to...

10:47.063 --> 10:49.732
I sent the text by mistake."

10:51.192 --> 10:52.985
"I meant to send it to my mom.

10:53.611 --> 10:56.572
I sent the text by mistake."

10:58.157 --> 10:59.659
"I meant to send it to my mom.

11:00.368 --> 11:01.494
I sent..."

11:02.495 --> 11:05.247
I sent the text by mistake.

11:06.374 --> 11:08.334
Yes. I figured you did.

11:13.756 --> 11:15.883
I meant to send it to my mom but...

11:32.358 --> 11:33.567
What's the big deal?

11:48.457 --> 11:49.667
No.

11:52.920 --> 11:55.756
You are watching a crazy girl
having an episode.

11:55.840 --> 11:59.218
Let's speak with an expert in the field.

11:59.301 --> 12:00.511
What do you think?

12:02.680 --> 12:04.056
I think it's time.

12:04.140 --> 12:07.017
Yes, that's right. She says it's time.

12:07.101 --> 12:09.854
Then how long do you predict
this stage to last?

12:09.937 --> 12:11.480
They say it usually takes

12:11.564 --> 12:13.983
half the duration of the relationship
to heal from it.

12:14.567 --> 12:18.988
They dated for a year and a half.
Half of that means nine months.

12:19.697 --> 12:20.948
My goodness.

12:21.198 --> 12:24.827
For nine months, we'll see a psychotic...

12:26.745 --> 12:30.374
We will now hear from our sponsors, JTBC.

12:49.351 --> 12:50.519
Hello?

12:52.771 --> 12:54.482
Ho-chang Kwon...

12:54.732 --> 12:57.193
Oh. Ho-chang Kwon.

12:57.860 --> 12:58.736
What's up?

13:01.238 --> 13:02.740
You want to talk?

13:05.659 --> 13:07.328
Okay. Sure.

13:08.204 --> 13:09.205
Okay.

13:11.749 --> 13:13.000
It's a guy.

13:13.584 --> 13:15.127
-Yes.
-A date?

13:16.003 --> 13:19.340
It's not really a date.
He just wants us to meet.

13:19.924 --> 13:23.719
"He just wants us to meet." How cocky.

13:24.678 --> 13:25.763
Is he cute?

13:26.514 --> 13:28.432
What's the standard of cuteness?

13:36.524 --> 13:38.526
In terms of looks...

13:40.361 --> 13:43.239
His look wasn't so bad.

13:48.869 --> 13:49.912
I must be crazy.

14:50.180 --> 14:52.766
-Is this the only place you know?
-Sorry?

14:54.268 --> 14:56.896
You seem to always be here.

14:58.439 --> 15:00.107
I hear that a lot.

15:05.029 --> 15:07.239
What did you want to talk about?

15:07.948 --> 15:10.367
Yes. What we were talking about last time.

15:10.993 --> 15:11.827
Pardon?

15:12.745 --> 15:15.915
I was telling you about the app
that I was developing.

15:16.582 --> 15:19.126
It's like a mobile lie detector.

15:19.209 --> 15:22.212
Most lie detectors
measure sweat and pulse.

15:22.296 --> 15:24.757
-Hold on.
-But this works with the voice...

15:24.840 --> 15:25.841
Excuse me.

15:26.842 --> 15:27.885
Yes?

15:28.886 --> 15:33.182
Did you really call me here
to talk about this?

15:33.265 --> 15:37.186
Yes. You said let's talk about it later.

15:49.865 --> 15:51.033
Did I...

15:52.034 --> 15:54.161
misunderstand you again?

15:54.662 --> 15:55.496
Yes.

16:01.085 --> 16:02.461
I'm sorry.

16:04.880 --> 16:07.800
Did you grow up abroad or something?

16:08.842 --> 16:10.260
No. Why?

16:11.720 --> 16:13.180
I just...

16:14.264 --> 16:17.309
You don't seem to understand people
very well.

16:19.186 --> 16:20.145
I hear that a lot.

16:23.148 --> 16:25.818
Then do you not have anything else to say?

16:27.611 --> 16:28.737
No.

16:33.075 --> 16:34.952
May I go then?

16:38.122 --> 16:39.164
Sure.

17:01.478 --> 17:04.023
-Why are you back so early?
-Whatever.

17:04.565 --> 17:07.735
What's his problem? I'm so annoyed.

17:07.818 --> 17:09.236
Why? What is it?

17:09.862 --> 17:12.740
Did he immediately want to go to a motel
and ask you to pay?

17:12.823 --> 17:14.366
What the heck?

17:15.242 --> 17:18.495
This actually happened
with Ye-eun's ex-boyfriend...

17:19.496 --> 17:21.957
-What is it now?
-That scumbag.

17:23.667 --> 17:27.212
-He's going on a blind date.
-Really? Isn't that a bit too soon?

17:27.296 --> 17:28.422
Exactly.

17:28.505 --> 17:29.339
How did you know?

17:29.423 --> 17:32.551
Look. I got it from a Facebook friend
of a Facebook friend of his.

17:32.634 --> 17:35.387
He set up blind dates for six people.
Physical Education majors.

17:35.846 --> 17:36.680
Physical Education?

17:37.264 --> 17:38.515
Please be weightlifters.

17:39.349 --> 17:43.187
Don't underestimate weightlifters.
Don't look down on Mi-ran Jang!

17:43.270 --> 17:46.231
No, it's just... he likes tight clothing.

17:47.399 --> 17:49.985
-Wrestlers are good too.
-Our School of Physical Education

17:50.069 --> 17:51.945
has gymnasts and rhythmic gymnasts too.

17:52.446 --> 17:53.280
So what?

17:54.823 --> 17:57.701
Nothing. I just meant...

17:57.785 --> 18:00.329
Our School of Physical Education
is diverse.

18:02.331 --> 18:03.916
Set me up with a guy.

18:04.583 --> 18:06.001
That's how you ask for a favor?

18:06.335 --> 18:08.003
Please set me up.

18:08.087 --> 18:10.547
You said to get over a guy with a new guy.

18:11.965 --> 18:14.176
-Do you know any guys?
-Me?

18:15.552 --> 18:17.262
I'll do it.

18:18.222 --> 18:19.932
You will?

18:20.390 --> 18:22.643
The 21st-century matchmaker. Madam Song.

18:23.852 --> 18:24.978
Any preferences?

18:26.105 --> 18:28.357
Just any guy.

18:28.857 --> 18:31.860
-But it has to be by this Thursday.
-Why?

18:31.944 --> 18:35.280
I'm going to meet someone
at least one day before he does. Okay?

18:38.200 --> 18:41.912
She's being competitive
over the strangest things.

18:55.300 --> 18:56.468
I choose you.

18:56.552 --> 18:58.178
Sorry? What do you mean?

18:58.262 --> 18:59.596
-Blind date.
-Sorry?

18:59.680 --> 19:00.973
Are you free tomorrow?

19:01.056 --> 19:03.934
ASSESSMENT SHEET
NAME OF GROUP: ASGARD

19:13.485 --> 19:15.028
HEIMDALLR

19:21.618 --> 19:23.203
Why are you thinking so hard?

19:26.165 --> 19:27.875
It's a little hard.

19:28.125 --> 19:29.751
Isn't that due this week?

19:30.377 --> 19:31.587
It is.

19:35.507 --> 19:37.384
HEIMDALLR

19:42.598 --> 19:45.434
DREAM ROCK FESTIVAL

20:01.241 --> 20:02.284
Damn it.

20:06.079 --> 20:07.164
Hey.

20:07.623 --> 20:08.874
Hey!

20:10.417 --> 20:11.919
What are you doing here?

20:12.669 --> 20:14.463
I was just...

20:16.798 --> 20:18.759
Why aren't you performing?

20:18.842 --> 20:19.676
Damn it.

20:21.386 --> 20:22.971
I shouldn't curse.

20:23.639 --> 20:25.515
We were supposed to get seven minutes,

20:25.599 --> 20:28.936
but they said Da-mi So's slot after us
was too short and cut us.

20:29.019 --> 20:30.354
It's so annoying.

20:30.437 --> 20:32.356
Wait until we make it big!

20:36.360 --> 20:37.361
Sorry.

20:38.654 --> 20:40.572
You would've enjoyed our performance.

20:40.656 --> 20:42.658
Well... No.

20:44.284 --> 20:46.536
Thank you for the meds and porridge.

20:52.125 --> 20:55.629
-Are you feeling better?
-Yes, thanks to your love.

20:55.837 --> 20:58.215
-What?
-This is a secret.

20:59.383 --> 21:01.927
I've never gotten that before.
You know, a tribute.

21:02.886 --> 21:04.012
"Tribute"?

21:04.388 --> 21:06.014
A gift from a fan.

21:06.515 --> 21:08.433
You're my number one fan.

21:09.434 --> 21:12.104
No, I'm not. It wasn't expensive,
and we work

21:12.479 --> 21:15.357
-at the same company...
-Hey! Get over here!

21:15.440 --> 21:16.483
Coming!

21:17.526 --> 21:20.529
Okay. I won't tell anyone else.

21:22.823 --> 21:23.824
Bye.

22:24.384 --> 22:26.803
-He lost 30kg?
-I had no clue.

22:26.887 --> 22:28.013
Hey.

22:28.513 --> 22:29.973
Listen.

22:30.057 --> 22:31.391
Tell them.

22:34.603 --> 22:37.272
I only meant it as a joke.

22:37.397 --> 22:39.357
What? A joke?

22:39.941 --> 22:43.070
A joke should be funny.
What about this is funny?

22:43.570 --> 22:45.363
I didn't serve in the army
because I was obese?

22:45.447 --> 22:46.740
How is that funny?

22:47.199 --> 22:49.785
The part where I said
you looked pregnant...

22:49.868 --> 22:53.497
What? Then it isn't true
that you lost 30kg?

22:53.580 --> 22:55.957
Hey. You believed it too?

22:56.041 --> 22:59.419
Well, I did question it, but...

23:00.003 --> 23:02.380
I guess not.
I was going to ask how you did it.

23:03.090 --> 23:06.259
That's odd. That's not what I heard.

23:06.843 --> 23:07.844
What?

23:09.387 --> 23:12.307
I heard the reason
you didn't serve in the army

23:13.266 --> 23:15.310
was due to a mental illness.

23:18.563 --> 23:19.648
Mental illness.

23:21.066 --> 23:24.152
Just how many lies did you tell?

23:24.236 --> 23:25.320
Well...

23:25.821 --> 23:29.116
I prepared a bunch
since I didn't know what you would like.

23:31.034 --> 23:34.412
Listen up. I didn't serve
in the army because I tore my ACL

23:34.496 --> 23:36.456
while playing soccer in high school!

23:36.540 --> 23:38.583
He kicked the ground instead of the ball.

23:39.209 --> 23:41.461
I can prove it! I have the scar! Look.

23:42.629 --> 23:44.548
Look. Seriously.

23:45.132 --> 23:47.092
-Oh my goodness.
-Seriously.

23:48.135 --> 23:49.636
It's not like I can show you.

23:49.719 --> 23:51.847
Show us.

23:51.930 --> 23:54.975
Why I ought to... You little...

23:55.058 --> 23:56.268
Are you two dating?

23:58.687 --> 23:59.604
No way.

24:00.814 --> 24:02.190
You mean it, right?

24:02.774 --> 24:04.860
You really aren't dating, right?

24:06.361 --> 24:07.612
Why do you care?

24:09.823 --> 24:13.368
That's right. Why do you care?

24:15.120 --> 24:18.331
Just... I want it to be clear.

24:28.049 --> 24:30.260
"Just... I want it to be clear."

24:30.927 --> 24:34.097
That coy little thing.
You're loving it, aren't you?

24:34.181 --> 24:35.974
You're holding it in, aren't you?

24:36.057 --> 24:40.478
Look at this punk. Your lips
are twitching because you want to smile.

24:40.562 --> 24:42.856
Stop that. What's the big deal?

24:43.523 --> 24:47.652
True. There was always one of those
at the beginning of every semester.

24:48.403 --> 24:51.448
What do girls see in this punk?

24:51.948 --> 24:54.951
Is it your back? Your once-torn ACL?

24:55.493 --> 24:56.995
Are you using magic?

24:58.747 --> 25:01.374
So? Will you date the sweet girl?

25:01.458 --> 25:03.251
Don't be ridiculous.

25:03.835 --> 25:05.712
Why not? She's pretty and cute.

25:06.129 --> 25:07.339
I'm better, but still.

25:09.549 --> 25:10.842
It's a pain.

25:16.514 --> 25:20.936
Don't press charges against me
or anything for asking this, okay?

25:21.353 --> 25:23.855
-Promise?
-What are you going to say now?

25:25.982 --> 25:29.361
How do you satisfy
your cravings from down there?

25:29.444 --> 25:31.238
You look normal enough.

25:31.738 --> 25:34.699
-Let's go see a doctor.
-You go see a doctor.

25:34.783 --> 25:37.827
-I already went.
-Not an ENT doctor. A psychiatrist.

25:38.703 --> 25:40.121
You've gotten weird lately.

25:40.580 --> 25:42.624
Is it weird that I'm weird?

25:42.707 --> 25:46.962
That's true. You've always been weird,
but it got worse.

25:47.337 --> 25:48.338
You...

25:49.381 --> 25:50.590
seem nervous lately.

25:54.094 --> 25:55.428
Is something wrong?

26:00.976 --> 26:03.478
Well... I don't know.

26:06.481 --> 26:08.149
That girl Hyo-jin

26:09.859 --> 26:14.155
transferred out because of a weird rumor
with the art teacher.

26:15.198 --> 26:16.408
What weird rumor?

26:17.951 --> 26:18.994
Child abuse.

26:21.079 --> 26:23.540
-Sexual?
-Yes.

26:24.582 --> 26:26.251
What does that have to do with you?

26:27.127 --> 26:28.128
I don't know.

26:31.047 --> 26:34.592
The truth is, I'm scared that it might
have something to do with me.

27:17.969 --> 27:18.803
Hey.

27:21.473 --> 27:23.516
-Are you going somewhere?
-Yes.

27:33.943 --> 27:35.528
-Welcome home.
-Thanks.

27:39.699 --> 27:40.658
What?

27:41.117 --> 27:43.787
-Where's Eun-jae going?
-Blind date.

27:45.038 --> 27:47.540
The look on her face
was like someone going to war.

27:54.923 --> 27:56.091
I'm Choong-hwan Cho.

27:57.842 --> 27:59.260
I'm Eun-jae Yoo.

27:59.719 --> 28:00.720
Hi.

28:05.308 --> 28:07.560
So, you live with Ji-won?

28:08.561 --> 28:09.562
Yes.

28:11.439 --> 28:13.650
She's funny, isn't she?

28:14.234 --> 28:15.235
Yes.

28:19.406 --> 28:22.242
-You're a psych major?
-Yes.

28:23.910 --> 28:26.162
You must know a lot
about the human psyche.

28:26.830 --> 28:30.583
Psychology is not
that simple a discipline.

28:31.960 --> 28:35.588
Well... I see. I'm sorry.

28:42.554 --> 28:44.806
How does a guy date another girl so easily

28:45.056 --> 28:47.517
after breaking up with their girlfriend?

28:47.600 --> 28:49.394
Sorry? Me?

28:49.978 --> 28:52.147
-Do you mean me?
-No.

28:52.230 --> 28:54.649
That's what I've noticed
among guys that I know.

28:55.191 --> 28:58.611
Going on a blind date
within a month of breaking up...

28:58.695 --> 29:02.532
Isn't that inconsiderate
to the ex-girlfriend?

29:03.241 --> 29:04.367
That's true.

29:08.121 --> 29:10.665
If you date someone new
after breaking up with your girlfriend,

29:10.999 --> 29:14.627
do you meet someone similar
or the complete opposite?

29:15.754 --> 29:16.880
Well...

29:17.547 --> 29:20.508
I... That's...

29:21.968 --> 29:25.263
-Each person...
-How about you?

29:26.514 --> 29:30.935
Me? Well I...

29:40.904 --> 29:44.824
You're very different
from what Ji-won told me about you.

30:06.554 --> 30:08.306
My house is this way.

30:08.389 --> 30:11.100
I'm going that way,
but I can take you home.

30:30.745 --> 30:32.872
ROMANCE OF YOUTH

30:56.187 --> 30:58.815
What are you doing?
Have you seen this video?

31:18.334 --> 31:19.377
-What?
-What?

31:19.460 --> 31:20.837
Just...

31:22.046 --> 31:27.302
Do you text a friend, a female friend
like dozens of times a day?

31:27.886 --> 31:31.014
"What are you doing? Did you eat?
What did you watch on TV?" Like that.

31:31.097 --> 31:32.390
Yes. Why?

31:32.974 --> 31:34.976
I see. That's normal.

31:35.643 --> 31:39.063
You get annoyed
if they don't respond, right?

31:39.147 --> 31:41.316
No. There's no need to get annoyed.

31:41.399 --> 31:43.484
You just assume they're busy.

31:43.693 --> 31:46.029
-Right?
-Yes.

31:49.324 --> 31:51.910
Do you ask to hang out every weekend?
To go watch movies and stuff?

31:51.993 --> 31:54.370
Isn't that natural
if you don't have a boyfriend?

31:54.954 --> 31:57.081
You watch movies together
and shop together.

31:57.165 --> 31:59.042
-Right?
-Yes.

32:00.251 --> 32:01.544
Right?

32:02.754 --> 32:05.840
Do you get annoyed
if she wants to bring another friend?

32:05.924 --> 32:09.135
No. I like hanging out in groups.

32:09.969 --> 32:13.139
-As long as it isn't someone I hate.
-Yes.

32:14.974 --> 32:15.975
Hey.

32:16.643 --> 32:17.769
How was it?

32:19.312 --> 32:20.939
How was what?

32:21.022 --> 32:23.816
What would I be asking someone
who went on a blind date?

32:23.900 --> 32:26.611
The North Korean nuclear missiles?
Global warming?

32:27.070 --> 32:28.905
How was the guy?

32:29.197 --> 32:32.367
Well, he wasn't bad, but...

32:32.450 --> 32:33.493
But?

32:34.369 --> 32:37.580
-He was short and...
-You said no tall guys.

32:38.498 --> 32:40.500
His face was too small.

32:41.167 --> 32:43.169
Isn't that a good thing?

32:45.046 --> 32:48.257
He knows too much and is too polite.

32:48.800 --> 32:50.343
Anyway, I wasn't interested.

32:58.935 --> 33:01.729
What the... That didn't make any sense.

33:09.737 --> 33:10.822
That guy.

33:12.448 --> 33:14.450
Tell him I don't want to see him.

33:14.534 --> 33:16.786
Okay. Bye.

33:19.205 --> 33:20.748
I said I don't want to see him.

33:21.416 --> 33:24.168
-That's right. I told him.
-What?

33:25.253 --> 33:28.423
Please turn him down nicely.

33:28.840 --> 33:33.302
I can tell he's a nice guy, but...

33:33.386 --> 33:35.138
It's okay. He said no too.

33:37.640 --> 33:38.683
What?

33:39.475 --> 33:43.104
He said he can tell you're a nice person,
but you aren't his type.

33:46.232 --> 33:48.526
I see. He did?

33:50.028 --> 33:51.112
That's good.

33:52.530 --> 33:53.448
Good.

34:01.539 --> 34:02.415
Why not?

34:04.083 --> 34:05.835
Why doesn't he want to see me?

34:06.419 --> 34:08.671
Why am I not his type?

34:11.340 --> 34:12.508
Well, just...

34:14.677 --> 34:16.262
What's his type?

34:16.763 --> 34:19.599
If he didn't like me,
he should've just said so.

34:20.058 --> 34:22.226
What the heck? That coward.

34:23.061 --> 34:25.146
But you said the same thing...

34:25.229 --> 34:26.689
What did I say?

34:48.669 --> 34:51.214
-What?
-I didn't say anything.

34:52.423 --> 34:54.050
Did you go to an all-girls school?

34:56.052 --> 34:57.470
How did you know?

34:59.514 --> 35:00.556
It's obvious.

35:15.279 --> 35:17.406
-Do you have something to say?
-Well...

35:19.200 --> 35:20.701
About Ye-ji and me.

35:21.202 --> 35:23.079
Do we really look like that?

35:23.162 --> 35:26.582
It's unreasonable to ask people
not to think that, the way you guys act.

35:28.876 --> 35:29.919
No?

35:30.628 --> 35:32.255
We're just friends.

35:32.380 --> 35:34.715
-For her too?
-Probably?

35:36.384 --> 35:38.427
-Then check.
-How?

35:38.511 --> 35:41.764
-Ask her.
-How can I ask that?

35:41.848 --> 35:43.599
She's very sensitive.

35:48.020 --> 35:49.105
What?

35:49.188 --> 35:52.567
You seem more sensitive, if you can't
ask something you want to ask.

35:52.942 --> 35:54.110
Whatever.

35:56.362 --> 35:57.738
Ever had a boyfriend?

35:58.239 --> 36:00.408
Who? Ye-ji?

36:00.992 --> 36:03.995
There were a lot of guys that liked her,
but she didn't...

36:07.665 --> 36:10.877
See? And you say you aren't interested.

36:11.127 --> 36:13.462
-What?
-You keep asking about Ye-ji.

36:13.546 --> 36:15.673
-I do?
-Want me to introduce you?

36:15.756 --> 36:17.383
She's super popular with guys.

36:17.466 --> 36:20.136
She's cute, feminine, and cutesy.

36:20.553 --> 36:22.889
That time was an exception.
She doesn't drink much.

36:27.602 --> 36:29.187
Forget it then.

36:30.479 --> 36:31.480
When?

36:35.401 --> 36:37.403
I have nothing better to do anyway.

36:58.382 --> 37:00.635
What is it? Are you expecting someone?

37:02.136 --> 37:03.179
Yes.

37:04.597 --> 37:06.057
Really? Who?

37:06.140 --> 37:08.643
Let's order first. Strawberry smoothie?

37:09.060 --> 37:10.061
Yes.

37:25.952 --> 37:27.495
What? Who is coming?

37:28.704 --> 37:30.873
I want to introduce someone to you.

37:30.957 --> 37:32.124
Who?

37:35.253 --> 37:36.087
Hey.

37:40.633 --> 37:42.718
-I'm right on time.
-Hey.

37:43.886 --> 37:45.304
What are you wearing?

37:45.972 --> 37:47.056
What's wrong with it?

37:53.729 --> 37:56.232
-Hello.
-Yes, hello.

37:56.816 --> 37:58.317
That's mine.

38:00.319 --> 38:03.364
What's the big deal?
Why is it so hot here?

38:03.948 --> 38:05.074
It's so hot.

38:10.705 --> 38:11.872
Who is he?

38:12.790 --> 38:14.625
-The thing is...
-Me?

38:15.126 --> 38:17.336
-Eun didn't tell you about me?
-Sorry?

38:19.255 --> 38:20.548
You didn't tell her about me?

38:21.215 --> 38:24.719
Well. I was just about to
introduce you to her, but...

38:25.761 --> 38:27.096
Stop that.

38:28.514 --> 38:29.849
She gets embarrassed so easily.

38:34.478 --> 38:35.980
What's wrong with you?

38:36.105 --> 38:38.899
You're so cute.

38:39.275 --> 38:40.651
I said, quit it!

38:42.570 --> 38:45.656
I need to use the restroom.

38:50.911 --> 38:53.456
-What's your problem?
-Happy?

38:54.123 --> 38:57.209
-What?
-I thought it over,

38:57.877 --> 39:00.755
and I thought it would be best
for you to like guys.

39:01.922 --> 39:05.926
Whether or not that's her preference,
she'll treat you as just a friend now.

39:06.010 --> 39:07.553
That's good then. Problem solved.

39:10.723 --> 39:11.849
How did you know?

39:12.516 --> 39:15.436
You're an open book to me.
You can't hide anything.

39:16.896 --> 39:17.938
Aren't you offended?

39:18.522 --> 39:20.024
If I am, will you apologize?

39:21.025 --> 39:22.109
That's a bit too much.

39:23.569 --> 39:25.321
You're cute when you do that.

39:25.946 --> 39:27.365
Do you really want to die?

39:27.448 --> 39:29.784
Why do you always get mad
when I compliment you?

39:30.201 --> 39:31.410
You little...

39:31.827 --> 39:34.205
And you're unnecessarily tall.

39:42.713 --> 39:44.590
What happened to your friend?

40:05.444 --> 40:06.654
She won't pick up?

40:09.740 --> 40:11.450
This is your fault.

40:15.371 --> 40:17.873
I told you she's very sensitive.

40:18.416 --> 40:20.835
-So?
-What if she was hurt?

40:21.419 --> 40:23.212
If she was hurt, then so be it.

40:23.295 --> 40:25.089
Or what? Do you plan to date her?

40:25.423 --> 40:27.258
That's not it, but...

40:30.219 --> 40:32.096
I hate hurting others.

40:33.848 --> 40:36.183
Especially people who like me.

40:37.184 --> 40:38.310
Why?

40:38.853 --> 40:40.729
Were you hurt by someone you liked?

40:51.699 --> 40:54.535
-Give me that. I'll carry it.
-It's okay.

40:54.869 --> 40:58.038
Why are you mad at me?
You don't care if you hurt me?

40:58.122 --> 40:59.331
No, not at all.

41:01.375 --> 41:03.836
You said you hate hurting people
who like you.

41:04.378 --> 41:05.421
What?

41:18.434 --> 41:19.685
Give it back.

41:20.644 --> 41:23.814
SEONGWON MARKET RENOVATION CELEBRATION

42:20.246 --> 42:21.580
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

42:33.217 --> 42:35.386
You said no.

42:36.595 --> 42:37.805
Are you in disguise?

42:39.265 --> 42:40.432
Disguise?

42:40.516 --> 42:42.142
Disguised as a commoner.

42:42.226 --> 42:44.186
Pretending not to be a boy band fan.

42:44.270 --> 42:47.189
-I'm really not.
-Then why are you here?

42:49.441 --> 42:53.946
It's okay. A lot of fans end up
working for entertainment agencies.

42:59.159 --> 43:00.452
You must be hot.

43:02.454 --> 43:05.374
I'm not hot at all, if I can be on stage.

43:05.874 --> 43:07.876
You're sweating so much, though.

43:07.960 --> 43:11.422
This isn't sweat. It's my passion
liquefied and flowing down.

43:14.091 --> 43:16.302
Watch me a little more, okay?

43:16.385 --> 43:19.388
I may be small now,
but I'll be a star one day.

43:20.556 --> 43:21.724
Is that possible?

43:21.807 --> 43:23.267
Look at the stars now.

43:23.350 --> 43:27.271
They were nobodies for ten years at first.
Some songs become hot five years later.

43:27.354 --> 43:29.106
I'll get a chance one day.

43:30.024 --> 43:31.734
-What if you don't?
-I will.

43:33.527 --> 43:36.405
-What if you still don't?
-I'm telling you, I will.

43:38.282 --> 43:39.825
-But what if you don't...
-I have to.

43:39.908 --> 43:42.661
I'm screwed if I don't, so I will.

43:43.579 --> 43:45.831
That's right. Tell me your name.

43:46.749 --> 43:47.958
Why?

43:49.793 --> 43:52.671
I'll say your name on stage next time.

43:54.131 --> 43:55.257
It's okay.

43:55.841 --> 43:57.009
It's okay.

43:57.301 --> 44:01.096
-It's okay.
-I'll say your name. I'll go now.

44:01.597 --> 44:02.598
Bye.

44:13.942 --> 44:16.862
Okay, perfume.

44:22.493 --> 44:24.411
-What's it like?
-Come here.

44:30.125 --> 44:31.418
Hello.

44:49.186 --> 44:50.479
JONG-YEOUL YOON

44:54.775 --> 44:55.818
Hey. You know, right?

44:58.362 --> 45:00.697
WOO-SUP HWANG

45:14.461 --> 45:16.171
Why? Why are you buying dinner?

45:16.505 --> 45:19.216
Just cause. Do I need a reason?

45:19.299 --> 45:21.468
True, but still.
Did something good happen?

45:22.261 --> 45:23.470
Every day is a good day.

45:23.554 --> 45:26.682
That's true. What are we having?
Let's get barbecue.

45:27.057 --> 45:29.017
No. We're going to a soju bar.

45:29.101 --> 45:31.437
-Why?
-What do you mean?

45:32.896 --> 45:33.981
Come with me.

45:39.069 --> 45:40.112
Hello.

45:41.697 --> 45:43.240
Room 7: Woo-sup Hwang plus 5

45:44.408 --> 45:46.160
-Do you have a reservation?
-No.

45:46.493 --> 45:47.744
We would like room eight.

45:48.495 --> 45:51.415
-Room eight is for four or more people.
-More are coming.

45:55.252 --> 45:56.837
What is it? Why?

45:57.296 --> 45:59.256
We'll know when we get there. Let's go.

46:04.178 --> 46:05.846
What's going on?

46:06.263 --> 46:07.681
What's wrong with her?

46:07.890 --> 46:09.516
Why don't you ask her?

46:10.309 --> 46:11.435
Sit down.

46:11.518 --> 46:13.896
Why do we need a reason?
We're all friends.

46:13.979 --> 46:16.899
We have a new housemate too.

46:17.024 --> 46:20.486
You're right. Come to think of it,
we never had a welcoming party.

46:21.069 --> 46:22.154
There's no need.

46:22.905 --> 46:25.616
She grumbles more when she feels awkward.

46:25.699 --> 46:28.160
-Let's order more stuff.
-Okay.

46:34.625 --> 46:37.211
Okay. Here's to our warm welcoming party!

46:37.294 --> 46:39.546
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

46:39.671 --> 46:40.589
Bottoms up!

46:46.428 --> 46:49.181
-Did you see the Fifth Column today?
-No.

46:49.264 --> 46:50.807
What are you waiting for?

46:50.891 --> 46:54.228
Get close to them and bring them home.

46:55.562 --> 46:57.064
Eun looks so happy.

46:57.481 --> 47:00.359
-I did not.
-See? She's grumbling again.

47:00.943 --> 47:03.320
You know Eun, the more I see you,
I see that you're cute.

47:03.403 --> 47:05.322
She is cute. She's the cute type.

47:07.407 --> 47:08.283
What's wrong?

47:09.159 --> 47:10.410
What?

47:10.953 --> 47:12.412
You've been...

47:13.497 --> 47:14.998
What's wrong?

47:16.083 --> 47:17.125
I'll go.

47:17.960 --> 47:20.712
-Where?
-I'll pretend I'm in the wrong room

47:20.796 --> 47:23.257
and see what they're doing in room seven.

47:23.340 --> 47:24.341
No. Don't.

47:25.592 --> 47:27.928
What is it? Is someone in that room?

47:28.011 --> 47:29.846
I told you it's nothing.

47:32.516 --> 47:34.268
Hey! Jong-yeoul!

47:34.351 --> 47:35.561
Stop it.

47:39.648 --> 47:40.524
You okay?

47:48.574 --> 47:50.450
Is your ex in that room?

47:54.037 --> 47:56.665
Yes. He's on a blind date.

47:58.709 --> 48:03.714
When I heard he was going on a blind date
so soon after we broke up...

48:03.797 --> 48:05.048
You went on one too.

48:05.841 --> 48:08.552
That's because I was angry that he was.

48:09.177 --> 48:10.804
You're so clingy.

48:12.139 --> 48:14.349
You were worse last year.

48:14.433 --> 48:17.436
Hey. I was... That...

48:22.357 --> 48:27.237
What's the big deal about love?
It isn't easy, is it?

48:27.362 --> 48:29.281
You never even had a relationship.

48:34.828 --> 48:36.246
You're confused lately, right?

48:37.331 --> 48:40.083
It's natural. It's your first breakup.

48:40.584 --> 48:43.712
You're lucky you're so sure
about everything.

48:52.262 --> 48:53.555
What was your boyfriend...

48:55.140 --> 48:58.727
I mean, your ex-boyfriend.

48:58.810 --> 49:00.103
What is he like?

49:01.521 --> 49:03.231
He's just...

49:03.982 --> 49:05.025
Is he good-looking?

49:05.609 --> 49:08.403
In terms of looks, he's just...

49:15.827 --> 49:18.747
Good-looking? Well...

49:22.668 --> 49:26.088
You can't really say that he's...

49:27.422 --> 49:31.218
You can't say he's good-looking. No way.

49:31.635 --> 49:32.761
Why not?

49:33.762 --> 49:35.472
He's pretty handsome.

49:39.810 --> 49:40.894
He is tall.

49:41.436 --> 49:43.939
He has a good personality
and laughs a lot.

49:44.272 --> 49:46.983
He's the type that girls like.
The sweet type.

49:47.067 --> 49:48.360
He's not sweet.

49:48.777 --> 49:51.071
Hey. Stick to one or the other, will you?

49:51.154 --> 49:52.864
What do you want to hear?

49:52.948 --> 49:54.783
Badmouthing or compliments?

49:56.326 --> 49:57.327
Well...

49:59.496 --> 50:02.416
I'm not sure either.

50:03.041 --> 50:06.294
We need to know the music
if we're going to dance along.

50:12.134 --> 50:13.093
Sorry.

50:15.595 --> 50:17.806
I don't know what's gotten into me lately.

50:19.266 --> 50:23.395
I'm so insecure and feel like
I'm becoming more and more of a loser.

50:26.815 --> 50:28.442
I don't want to, but...

50:38.368 --> 50:39.619
Jin-myung.

50:43.540 --> 50:44.708
Here's to Eun-jae.

50:45.834 --> 50:47.210
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

50:50.505 --> 50:51.965
I'm sorry.

50:57.179 --> 51:00.515
Do you want to see
what the Fifth Column looks like?

51:00.682 --> 51:02.809
Okay. I don't know who they are.

51:02.893 --> 51:05.228
Eun is so obsessed.

51:05.562 --> 51:08.231
-Memorize their faces.
-This is them.

51:24.498 --> 51:26.416
What am I feeling?

51:29.085 --> 51:31.671
First love. First breakup.

51:33.298 --> 51:35.634
Does everyone get this confused?

51:39.262 --> 51:43.350
If enough time passes,
will I eventually forget?

51:44.893 --> 51:46.561
If I forget, will I be happy?

51:54.903 --> 51:56.905
Do I want to forget?

51:57.864 --> 51:59.866
Or do I not want to forget?

52:04.371 --> 52:05.831
Hey. Eun-jae.

52:15.590 --> 52:18.385
-I'm sorry.
-Hey...

52:20.220 --> 52:22.347
Hey, give me that.

52:51.126 --> 52:52.377
It's okay.

52:52.460 --> 52:55.088
The sun will rise again tomorrow.

52:55.171 --> 52:56.756
I wish it wouldn't.

52:57.173 --> 52:59.759
I wish the world would come to an end.

53:02.345 --> 53:06.099
Don't annihilate seven billion people
just because you feel humiliated.

53:19.571 --> 53:22.699
How humiliating. Seriously.

53:24.868 --> 53:27.037
-You think he figured it out?
-That's a given.

53:27.120 --> 53:29.164
There are so many bars by our school.

53:29.247 --> 53:31.499
And right in the next room, too.

53:31.583 --> 53:33.835
Only an idiot wouldn't figure it out.

53:35.003 --> 53:36.588
Poor Eun-jae.

53:37.881 --> 53:39.507
I would take the semester off.

53:40.091 --> 53:41.259
It's that bad?

53:51.102 --> 53:54.522
What's wrong with her?
She's laughing, right?

53:55.315 --> 53:57.984
Was the shock too much,
that she went crazy?

53:58.276 --> 54:00.111
-Eun-jae.
-Yes?

54:01.071 --> 54:02.155
What is it?

54:03.114 --> 54:04.240
He wasn't there.

54:05.659 --> 54:06.868
Who wasn't?

54:16.670 --> 54:18.922
Why is she so happy about that?

54:19.547 --> 54:23.677
She thinks he didn't go
because he isn't over her.

54:24.052 --> 54:27.305
Hey. I can name 105 reasons
why he couldn't go.

54:27.764 --> 54:29.641
He got enteritis. His dad got enteritis.

54:29.724 --> 54:31.893
His mom got enteritis. He got gastritis.

54:31.977 --> 54:34.145
-Let her be happy.
-His dad got gastritis.

54:36.272 --> 54:40.026
Not being over Eun-jae
could be among the 105 reasons.

54:40.735 --> 54:43.655
Sure, it isn't utterly impossible.

55:05.260 --> 55:06.511
What happened yesterday?

55:09.472 --> 55:10.473
Are you mad?

55:11.141 --> 55:12.142
Why would I be?

55:12.892 --> 55:14.102
You tell me.

55:19.107 --> 55:20.025
Of course, I'm mad.

55:22.902 --> 55:24.904
I thought we were friends.

55:26.740 --> 55:29.034
Why didn't you tell me
about your boyfriend?

55:29.409 --> 55:30.493
What?

55:30.869 --> 55:32.620
Wouldn't you be mad?

55:34.205 --> 55:35.957
Sorry.

55:37.542 --> 55:39.586
Who is he? What does he do?

55:40.837 --> 55:43.131
He's our landlord's relative.

55:43.673 --> 55:46.301
He's watching the house for her
for a while.

55:46.843 --> 55:48.595
You couldn't have dated long.

55:49.429 --> 55:51.431
-It's not what you think...
-Congrats.

55:54.017 --> 55:55.060
Thanks.

55:57.604 --> 55:59.105
-Hello.
-Hello.

55:59.189 --> 56:00.607
-Hello.
-Hello.

56:00.690 --> 56:01.649
Are you doing well?

56:01.733 --> 56:02.776
-Yes.
-Yes.

56:02.859 --> 56:04.652
Let's take attendance.

56:05.528 --> 56:07.405
Bo-ra Kang.

56:07.489 --> 56:09.157
-Okay. Kyung-moo Koo?
-Yes.

56:09.240 --> 56:11.159
I pretend not to know,

56:11.493 --> 56:13.578
because if I say that I know,

56:13.661 --> 56:16.289
I can't pretend not to know anymore.

56:16.790 --> 56:19.667
-It's so nice out.
-Seriously.

56:19.793 --> 56:21.252
We should go somewhere to enjoy it.

56:26.299 --> 56:28.718
I see only what I want to see

56:29.302 --> 56:32.889
because if I see too many things,
I'll lose my way.

56:33.765 --> 56:37.018
NAME OF GROUP, SCORE

56:50.365 --> 56:52.575
HEIMDALLR

56:53.243 --> 56:55.453
I don't care...

57:07.674 --> 57:11.136
because it's useless anyway.

57:22.147 --> 57:24.607
I believe only what I want to believe

57:25.233 --> 57:28.445
because that makes me slightly happier.

57:36.161 --> 57:40.248
Hyo-jin Moon, May 10th, 2004
On a field trip

57:41.416 --> 57:44.252
I remember only what I want to remember

57:46.546 --> 57:49.757
because I must protect myself.

58:14.365 --> 58:17.619
What didn't you know back then?

58:27.754 --> 58:29.172
You don't know me, do you?

58:30.590 --> 58:31.633
No.

58:39.724 --> 58:40.975
I guess you don't.

58:46.189 --> 58:47.357
Pretty shoes.

59:21.266 --> 59:24.727
Hide well so I don't see you

59:24.811 --> 59:28.022
Hide well so I don't see you

59:28.606 --> 59:32.151
Hide well so I don't see you

59:32.652 --> 59:34.070
Here I come!

59:54.966 --> 59:56.467
Tie your hair sometimes.

59:56.551 --> 59:58.720
How is even the back of your neck pretty?

59:58.803 --> 1:00:00.722
A way to win your ex-boyfriend back?

1:00:00.805 --> 1:00:04.058
A flower? Show him a side of you
that he didn't see before.

1:00:04.642 --> 1:00:07.270
-You'll go with me, right?
-What is that crap?

1:00:07.353 --> 1:00:10.732
I'm looking for a friend Hyo-jin Moon,
who had transferred out.

1:00:10.815 --> 1:00:13.776
What does her running away
during junior high have to do with us?

1:00:13.860 --> 1:00:17.488
Just in case, but don't tell me
that you like me or anything.

1:00:17.572 --> 1:00:19.324
I heard you're going to the army. When?

1:00:19.407 --> 1:00:22.285
-Ye-ji is really cute, isn't she?
-You're cute too.

1:00:22.368 --> 1:00:25.747
For the remaining five,
their contracts will be canceled.

1:00:25.830 --> 1:00:27.665
Are you stressed? Eat this and cheer up.

1:00:27.749 --> 1:00:31.836
Let's avoid any problems
and make it clean.

1:00:32.045 --> 1:00:33.087
Chin up, my number one fan!

1:00:33.171 --> 1:00:36.466
Just a minute. Have you been okay lately?
Are you getting strange texts...

1:00:36.633 --> 1:00:38.384
Madame Jung. What is it?

1:00:50.188 --> 1:00:51.939
ARE YOU MORE COMFORTABLE FINANCIALLY NOW?

1:00:52.023 --> 1:00:56.819
No. I still have my college loans,
and my mom's debt,

1:00:56.903 --> 1:00:58.863
so it'll probably be the same for a while.

1:00:59.614 --> 1:01:01.824
About 90% of the price of clothing
is fluff,

1:01:01.908 --> 1:01:03.951
so I buy clothes without the fluff.

1:01:04.035 --> 1:01:08.498
I went to a hotel in Busan for work,
so I got to see my boyfriend then.

1:01:09.082 --> 1:01:11.501
It was an important decision for Asgard,

1:01:11.584 --> 1:01:14.629
so I wanted to be as thoughtful
as I could be.

1:01:14.837 --> 1:01:19.717
SOME SAY YOU SEE YOUR BROTHER
SOO-MYUNG IN HEIMDALLR.

1:01:19.801 --> 1:01:20.843
I do not.

1:01:24.806 --> 1:01:25.848
HOW TALL?

1:01:25.932 --> 1:01:27.183
A little taller than 170cm.

1:01:27.934 --> 1:01:30.395
No, I'm not 180cm.

1:01:30.645 --> 1:01:32.689
What you mean, 180cm? That's ridiculous.

1:01:33.272 --> 1:01:36.693
I suddenly started to grow
after the sixth grade.

1:01:36.859 --> 1:01:38.820
I grew 12cm in a year.

1:01:38.903 --> 1:01:39.946
YOUR DAD'S NEW FAMILY...

1:01:40.029 --> 1:01:41.280
What, I'm my dad's old family?

1:01:41.364 --> 1:01:42.657
WAS THE LETTER DESTINY?

1:01:42.740 --> 1:01:44.867
It's nothing that grand.

1:01:44.951 --> 1:01:46.035
It just made me angry.

1:01:46.119 --> 1:01:48.663
WAS YOUR FIRST ENCOUNTER
WITH JANG-HOON ALSO DESTINY?

1:01:48.746 --> 1:01:50.665
Whatever.

1:01:50.748 --> 1:01:54.419
WOW! WHAT'S THIS?
THAT REACTION WAS NOT EXPECTED.

1:01:54.502 --> 1:01:56.003
It's bitter.

1:01:57.630 --> 1:02:00.299
I don't usually eat when I drink.

1:02:00.383 --> 1:02:03.010
THEY SAY YOUR PERSONALITY VARIES.
IS THERE A FORMULA FOR THAT?

1:02:03.094 --> 1:02:05.179
Well, the thing is...

1:02:05.972 --> 1:02:11.978
The best is being with people I can trust
in a familiar place.

1:02:12.061 --> 1:02:15.314
Being alone in a familiar place.

1:02:15.398 --> 1:02:19.152
Being with people I can trust
in an unfamiliar place.

1:02:19.235 --> 1:02:21.362
Being alone in an unfamiliar place.

1:02:21.946 --> 1:02:23.072
March was the worst.

1:02:23.156 --> 1:02:24.031
WHEN WAS THE TOUGHEST?

1:02:24.115 --> 1:02:24.991
WHAT FEARS YOU MOST?

1:02:25.074 --> 1:02:27.660
My biggest fear is
what if I stay like this forever.

1:02:28.244 --> 1:02:30.455
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO DOO-YOUNG?

1:02:33.082 --> 1:02:36.169
To repent for what he did to me.

1:02:39.589 --> 1:02:43.426
God says to forgive everything, so...

1:02:46.095 --> 1:02:50.016
Anyway, I just hope
he never shows up again.

1:02:50.600 --> 1:02:51.642
MORE FOOD?

1:02:51.726 --> 1:02:54.228
I want seafood ramen.

1:02:54.312 --> 1:02:57.064
I would like seafood ramen with an egg.

1:02:57.940 --> 1:02:59.734
ARE YOU HAPPY THAT JONG-YEOUL DIDN'T GO?

1:02:59.817 --> 1:03:01.194
No.

1:03:01.277 --> 1:03:02.445
YOU'VE CHANGED THE PAST YEAR.

1:03:02.528 --> 1:03:03.362
How?

1:03:03.446 --> 1:03:04.447
YOUR FACE, CHARACTER...

1:03:04.530 --> 1:03:06.240
I did? I can't tell.

1:03:06.324 --> 1:03:07.533
YOU DRINK A LOT.

1:03:08.117 --> 1:03:09.243
My mom drinks a lot.

1:03:09.327 --> 1:03:11.287
She drinks more than my dad.

1:03:11.370 --> 1:03:13.289
It's not that I'm not over Jong-yeoul...

1:03:13.372 --> 1:03:14.415
ARE YOU OVER JONG-YEOUL?

1:03:15.374 --> 1:03:18.586
Excuse me. Another bottle of soju...

1:03:22.131 --> 1:03:23.382
Hello.

1:03:23.466 --> 1:03:25.134
SORRY I'M LATE. DID YOU DRINK A LOT?

1:03:25.218 --> 1:03:27.804
Not at all. I've been waiting.

1:03:28.137 --> 1:03:29.096
Shall we begin?

1:03:34.519 --> 1:03:36.979
Excuse me! I need a new shot glass!

1:03:38.898 --> 1:03:41.275
