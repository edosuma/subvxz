WEBVTT

00:05.073 --> 00:06.674
Previously on ER...

00:06.707 --> 00:08.442
A woman I went
to med school with

00:08.476 --> 00:10.544
has a patient who's very sick--
a young boy...

00:10.578 --> 00:12.313
And the surgical team

00:12.346 --> 00:14.482
that performed it in Croatia
has disbanded since then.

00:14.515 --> 00:16.117
( screaming )
What?

00:16.149 --> 00:17.785
We got a guy in here,
says he's your husband.

00:17.818 --> 00:19.287
We wanted burgers,

00:19.320 --> 00:22.256
so we took a cab
to this drive-through--

00:22.290 --> 00:24.392
Turns out to be
a mini-chapel.

00:24.425 --> 00:25.459
So I spoke
to an attorney.

00:25.493 --> 00:27.228
Uh, yeah, me, too.

00:27.261 --> 00:29.430
He said annulling
the marriage should
be fairly easy.

00:29.463 --> 00:30.531
That's what my guy said.

00:30.564 --> 00:31.599
Any word on Eric?

00:31.632 --> 00:32.833
I don't expect any.

00:32.866 --> 00:34.602
It's like a bear
hibernating.

00:34.635 --> 00:36.404
Any patient here
over six hours

00:36.437 --> 00:38.539
is a failure of your
management skills, not mine.

00:38.572 --> 00:39.573
Treat, turf, or dispo.

00:39.607 --> 00:40.674
( grunts )

00:40.708 --> 00:42.776

01:06.467 --> 01:09.637
( whimpering )

01:18.246 --> 01:20.714
Okay, okay, okay.

01:20.748 --> 01:23.351
Okay... okay.

01:23.384 --> 01:25.353
Okay, okay.

01:25.386 --> 01:26.754
Okay, come on, come...

01:26.787 --> 01:28.789
Please, please, please.

01:28.822 --> 01:29.757
I'm sorry.

01:29.790 --> 01:31.159
I'm sorry.

01:31.192 --> 01:33.527
Okay.

02:21.842 --> 02:24.812
LEWIS:
Clear.

02:24.845 --> 02:26.247
Got a rhythm.

02:26.280 --> 02:27.881
Sinus tach.
LEWIS:
Got a pulse.

02:27.915 --> 02:30.851
Trying for pressure.

02:30.884 --> 02:32.386
Good breath sounds.

02:32.420 --> 02:33.787
Satting at 91.

02:33.821 --> 02:35.856
Put him on 100%
non-rebreather.

02:37.758 --> 02:38.959
Pupils...

02:38.992 --> 02:41.929
four millimeters
and reactive.

02:41.962 --> 02:43.564
B.P. is 90 palp.

02:43.597 --> 02:47.601
All right, he's back,
whoever he is.

03:39.052 --> 03:40.788
Hey.
Hey.

03:40.821 --> 03:41.855
What's Kerry
doing down here?

03:41.889 --> 03:42.923
Romano damage control.

03:42.956 --> 03:44.492
Are you making
a lab run, Malik?

03:44.525 --> 03:46.327
It ain't my lunch.
Thank you.

03:46.360 --> 03:47.361
What do you got there?

03:47.395 --> 03:48.762
That is my NGO pack

03:48.796 --> 03:51.532
from L'Alliance de
Medicine Internationale.

03:51.565 --> 03:53.033
I thought you said
you weren't going?

03:53.066 --> 03:54.402
Yeah, I'm not.

03:54.435 --> 03:55.869
Well, why did they send it
to you?

03:55.903 --> 03:57.305
I guess they were hoping

03:57.338 --> 03:58.472
that I'm going
to change my mind.

03:58.506 --> 03:59.707
My shots are good
for a year.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.442
You didn't sign
anything, did you?

04:01.475 --> 04:03.511
No. It's a volunteer
organization.

04:03.544 --> 04:04.778
They can't draft you.

04:04.812 --> 04:06.714
Luka is still going
to the Congo.

04:06.747 --> 04:09.650
I know. He doesn't
listen to me, either.

04:09.683 --> 04:11.785
So, with Weaver
back down here,

04:11.819 --> 04:13.487
does that mean that
Romano is history?

04:13.521 --> 04:14.788
He moved his office
out of Exam One,

04:14.822 --> 04:16.055
but that could just be

04:16.089 --> 04:17.658
because the urine smell
is burning his eyes.

04:17.690 --> 04:19.627
Oh, she's probably just
working a couple shifts

04:19.660 --> 04:21.362
for appearance's sake,
just to keep people

04:21.394 --> 04:22.663
from freaking out
or killing him.

04:22.696 --> 04:23.964
We tried that.
ROMANO:
Carter!

04:23.997 --> 04:25.799
They just keep
putting him back together.

04:25.833 --> 04:27.835
Dr. John Carter,
meet your new med students.

04:27.868 --> 04:29.470
My students?

04:29.503 --> 04:31.405
Yeah. You are Chief Resident,
aren't you?

04:31.439 --> 04:33.807
Yes.
And this is still a
teaching hospital,
is it not?

04:33.841 --> 04:34.775
Yes, but...

04:34.808 --> 04:36.410
Good, then start teaching.

04:36.444 --> 04:38.011
Don't worry. He's a lot smarter
than he looks.

04:38.045 --> 04:39.813
Dr. Carter's been with us
for what, four years now?

04:39.847 --> 04:41.615
Nine.

04:41.649 --> 04:43.617
Ah, well, hopefully, you'll all
be, uh, quicker studies.

04:43.651 --> 04:44.618
Watch your backs!

04:44.652 --> 04:45.819
Hey, you want this, Carter?

04:45.853 --> 04:46.854
George Zito,
complaining of eight

04:46.887 --> 04:48.489
out of ten chest pain.

04:48.522 --> 04:50.991
That was 20 minutes ago.
Now it's a five.

04:51.024 --> 04:52.760
Yeah, a cigarette would've done
the same thing.

04:52.793 --> 04:54.662
You ever have
a heart attack
before, Mr. Zito?

04:54.695 --> 04:56.630
You mean,
besides this one?

04:56.664 --> 04:58.699
Pulse is 92.
B.P. is, uh, 155/100.

04:58.732 --> 04:59.967
All right,
Trauma One.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.435
Carter, Air Rescue's
bringing in an MVA

05:01.469 --> 05:02.636
ten minutes out.

05:02.670 --> 05:04.104
Yeah, and my dance
card is full.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.506
I'll get Lewis.

05:05.539 --> 05:07.608
So, who can tell me
the risk factors

05:07.641 --> 05:10.611
for coronary
artery disease?

05:10.644 --> 05:12.045
Chopper's bringing
a trauma in.

05:12.079 --> 05:14.081
We're going to need a second
line for lidocaine.

05:14.114 --> 05:16.650
Is it Unit 27,
the helicopter?

05:16.684 --> 05:17.618
I don't know. Why?

05:17.651 --> 05:18.852
Chuck flies with the 27.

05:18.886 --> 05:20.654
Oh, right, Chuck.

05:20.688 --> 05:22.556
Yeah, I know,
it's weird,

05:22.590 --> 05:23.791
but there's something
about him.

05:23.824 --> 05:26.527
He makes me feel good.

05:26.560 --> 05:28.462
Not that way.

05:28.496 --> 05:29.663
Well, that way, too.

05:29.697 --> 05:31.799
You know what I mean.

05:31.832 --> 05:34.101
Uh, his name's
James Shaw.

05:34.134 --> 05:37.405
He's on Mellaril,
per Dr. Kazanjian.

05:37.438 --> 05:38.539
Mellaril?

05:38.572 --> 05:39.707
An anti-psychotic.

05:39.740 --> 05:41.842
James, how many Mellaril
did you take?

05:41.875 --> 05:43.777
They're all gone.
I need some more.

05:43.811 --> 05:46.146
If you take too many pills,
your heart can stop.

05:46.179 --> 05:47.881
The pills scramble the signal.

05:47.915 --> 05:49.650
It keeps them from finding me.

05:49.683 --> 05:51.485
Keeps who
from finding you?

05:51.519 --> 05:53.454
They know my neural pattern.

05:53.487 --> 05:55.656
No, nobody's
going to find
you here, James.

05:55.689 --> 05:57.525
They monitor the 40 hertz range.

05:57.558 --> 05:58.626
Abby.
Yeah.

05:58.659 --> 05:59.593
Your brother's
on the phone.

05:59.627 --> 06:00.561
What?!

06:00.594 --> 06:01.462
Eric.

06:01.495 --> 06:02.663
( whimpering )

06:02.696 --> 06:05.499
Uh, okay, I-I'll
be right there.

06:05.533 --> 06:07.468
You can tell
because it tastes like metal.

06:07.501 --> 06:09.002
Is your brother okay?
I don't know.

06:09.036 --> 06:10.671
I haven't heard from
him in two months.

06:10.704 --> 06:13.474
Okay, I have to leave
before they scan this place.

06:13.507 --> 06:14.875
James, listen to me.

06:14.908 --> 06:17.578
James, they can't scan
you in here, okay,

06:17.611 --> 06:19.179
because radiology is upstairs,

06:19.212 --> 06:21.749
and the floors and
the walls are lined

06:21.782 --> 06:24.084
with lead.

06:24.117 --> 06:25.719
Okay, my
name's Abby.

06:25.753 --> 06:27.755
I'm going to help you.

06:28.756 --> 06:29.657
Okay.

06:29.690 --> 06:30.891
Okay.

06:30.924 --> 06:32.926
Give him five more
of Haldol.

06:32.960 --> 06:34.662
Use restraints
if you have to.

06:34.695 --> 06:36.697
Call his PMD,
and let him know he's here.

06:38.165 --> 06:39.667
( sighing )

06:39.700 --> 06:40.768
Can you watch him?

06:40.801 --> 06:42.603
I have to take a phone call.

06:44.772 --> 06:45.906
What line?

06:45.939 --> 06:47.007
Hmm?

06:47.040 --> 06:48.776
What line's
my brother on?

06:48.809 --> 06:51.178
Oh, he, uh, he said
he'd call back in an hour.

06:51.211 --> 06:53.080
Call back
from where?

06:53.113 --> 06:54.715
I don't know.

06:54.748 --> 06:56.984
Well, did he sound...
in trouble?

06:57.017 --> 06:58.486
Did he sound
like he was all right?

06:58.519 --> 06:59.787
I don't know.

06:59.820 --> 07:01.088
He said he'd call
back in an hour.

07:01.121 --> 07:02.823
Are you the only person
in this hospital

07:02.856 --> 07:04.024
that doesn't know
about my crazy family?

07:04.057 --> 07:05.826
What?

07:05.859 --> 07:07.561
Can you just please
come and find me
when he calls back?

07:07.595 --> 07:08.862
I don't care
where I am.

07:08.896 --> 07:09.997
Drag me out of a
stall if you have to.

07:10.030 --> 07:11.231
Yeah, can I?

07:11.264 --> 07:13.033
Abby, could you help me
over here, please?

07:13.066 --> 07:14.034
Sure, one second.

07:14.067 --> 07:15.168
Hey, Mom, it's me.

07:15.202 --> 07:16.570
( sighs )

07:16.604 --> 07:18.005
Uh, Eric called,
and I was wondering

07:18.038 --> 07:19.139
if you'd heard
from him.

07:19.172 --> 07:20.808
Can you call me
at work? Thanks.

07:20.841 --> 07:22.676
All right, I got a guy
who came in complaining

07:22.710 --> 07:23.844
of a severe sore throat.

07:23.877 --> 07:25.679
I want to send off
a culture and a CBC.

07:25.713 --> 07:26.880
Okay.

07:26.914 --> 07:28.081
This is Andrew.

07:28.115 --> 07:29.583
Hi, Andrew.

07:29.617 --> 07:31.118
ROMANO:
What is this guy
still doing here?

07:31.151 --> 07:32.653
I'm still
working him up.

07:32.686 --> 07:33.754
Yeah, wrong.
Hold this.

07:33.787 --> 07:35.188
Take these--
they're for you.

07:35.222 --> 07:36.757
I'm already
seeing eight.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.191
Well, now you're seeing 12,
and I'm going

07:38.225 --> 07:40.528
to give you four more
every 15 minutes, so I suggest

07:40.528 --> 07:41.629
you start turfing people,

07:41.662 --> 07:42.830
beginning
with sore throat boy here.

07:42.863 --> 07:44.832
He has a low-grade fever
and adenopathy.

07:44.865 --> 07:46.734
You know, if I wanted
a nurse's opinion...

07:46.767 --> 07:48.168
well, I don't know
what I'd do,

07:48.201 --> 07:53.040
because, quite frankly,
it's never happened.

07:53.073 --> 07:54.207
Say "Ahh."

07:54.241 --> 07:55.543
Ahh.

07:55.576 --> 07:56.744
Yeah, he's got
no exudates.

07:56.777 --> 07:57.878
Write him a scrip for erythro,

07:57.911 --> 07:59.079
and get him out of this bed.

07:59.112 --> 08:00.681
He's in a lot of pain.

08:00.714 --> 08:02.783
Yeah, that is why they call it
a sore throat.

08:02.816 --> 08:04.718
Viral pharyngitis will go away
on its own.

08:04.752 --> 08:06.053
If it's viral,

08:06.086 --> 08:08.221
why would you give him
antibiotics?

08:08.255 --> 08:09.790
You've kept him here two hours.

08:09.823 --> 08:10.791
Call it a consolation prize.

08:10.824 --> 08:11.892
Hi. I'm Rocket Romano.

08:11.925 --> 08:12.993
I'm the head
of the ER.

08:13.026 --> 08:14.562
Uh, you look
a little lost.

08:14.562 --> 08:15.796
Dr. Horvat.
You're a doctor?

08:15.829 --> 08:17.264
Surgeon. I'm visiting
from Croatia.

08:17.297 --> 08:18.599
Ah, what a
coincidence.

08:18.632 --> 08:19.867
I'm also a visiting
surgeon.

08:19.900 --> 08:21.635
Can I buy you a cup
of coffee or something?

08:21.669 --> 08:22.736
Um...
Hey.

08:22.770 --> 08:24.304
You've been here long?
No.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.273
You two know
each other.

08:26.306 --> 08:28.108
We went to the same
medical school.

08:28.141 --> 08:29.610
No doubt.

08:29.643 --> 08:31.211
Gordana is here to
observe a correction

08:31.244 --> 08:33.947
of a congenital heart repair
on a young boy from Croatia.

08:33.981 --> 08:35.683
You don't want
to get too close to this one.

08:35.716 --> 08:36.850
Why not?
Let's just say

08:36.884 --> 08:38.085
it's not
a good idea.

08:38.118 --> 08:39.052
What a beautiful language.

08:39.086 --> 08:40.220
Dr. Kovac,
I don't want

08:40.253 --> 08:41.589
to keep you from
your patients,

08:41.621 --> 08:43.090
and by the looks
of the board,

08:43.123 --> 08:45.192
it looks like you're running
a little behind, so...

08:45.225 --> 08:46.827
It's a pleasure meeting you.

08:47.928 --> 08:49.262
He seems nice enough.

08:49.296 --> 08:51.599
He's a prince.

08:51.632 --> 08:52.766
It's good to see you.

08:52.800 --> 08:54.167
It's good
to see you, too, Luka.

08:54.201 --> 08:54.935
You look great.

08:54.968 --> 08:56.336
You, too.

08:56.369 --> 08:58.305
I wish I could have set up
your surgery here.

08:58.338 --> 08:59.973
I toured Mercy's facilities,

09:00.007 --> 09:02.810
it's a very modern hospital
with all-new equipment.

09:02.843 --> 09:05.913
Maybe it's
just as well then.

09:05.946 --> 09:07.180
That's not
what I meant.

09:07.214 --> 09:09.049
It's okay, this place
is falling apart.

09:09.082 --> 09:11.284
No money, no staff,
it's perfect for me.

09:11.318 --> 09:12.753
Luka! 26-year-old

09:12.786 --> 09:14.354
passenger in a rollover MVA.

09:14.387 --> 09:15.823
Okay, Trauma Two.

09:15.856 --> 09:17.290
Do you want to see
what American ER docs do?

09:17.324 --> 09:18.759
I guess so.

09:18.792 --> 09:20.761
He was initially awake
with a GCS of 13,

09:20.794 --> 09:22.162
but he had a prolonged
extraction,

09:22.195 --> 09:23.731
and we tubed him for LOC.

09:23.764 --> 09:25.766
Susan, this is Gordana,
a surgeon from back home.

09:25.799 --> 09:27.801
Hi. Did he talk
before he crashed?

09:27.835 --> 09:28.802
Headache, belly pain?

09:28.836 --> 09:29.937
No. He was just pretty much

09:29.970 --> 09:32.706
cursing me out till he crumped.

09:32.740 --> 09:34.074
Do you want me to call
a social worker down on this?

09:34.107 --> 09:35.809
She may not be
mother of the year,

09:35.843 --> 09:37.778
but I don't sense that
she'd hurt the child.

09:37.811 --> 09:39.680
The baby's sick,
and the mother's evasive.

09:39.713 --> 09:40.881
It could be
Munchausen's by proxy.

09:40.914 --> 09:42.315
Let's just get
our test back.

09:42.349 --> 09:44.151
Hey, is this a spot check,
or are you slumming?

09:44.184 --> 09:45.252
Here, help me put this on.

09:45.285 --> 09:46.854
I'm still
working shifts.

09:46.887 --> 09:48.856
Wow, the perks down here
never stop, do they?

09:48.889 --> 09:49.957
What are you
doing, Robert?

09:49.990 --> 09:51.358
Observation and evaluation.

09:51.391 --> 09:53.861
Oh, you mean
belittling
and bullying?

09:53.894 --> 09:55.128
Gloves, too.

09:55.162 --> 09:56.263
You want both?

09:56.296 --> 09:57.230
( alarms )

09:57.264 --> 09:58.265
Somebody page neurosurgery.

09:58.298 --> 09:58.866
I thought I could smell blood.

09:58.899 --> 10:00.100
No sats.

10:00.133 --> 10:01.869
It's the Marilyn Manson
manicure.

10:01.902 --> 10:03.036
What's that mean?
The nail polish
keeps the oxygen

10:03.070 --> 10:04.672
saturation probe
from working.

10:04.705 --> 10:05.673
Abby, when you get a chance,
grab some acetone,

10:05.706 --> 10:06.940
and get a good nail on him.

10:06.974 --> 10:08.709
ROMANO:
Crepitus around
the sternum.

10:08.742 --> 10:10.077
You going to be up there
all day?

10:10.110 --> 10:10.811
Just till
I secure
the airway.

10:10.844 --> 10:12.345
I saw it go in.

10:12.379 --> 10:13.914
No offense. I
check all the
paramedic tubes.

10:13.947 --> 10:15.749
Yeah, since you guys miss
50% of the time.

10:15.783 --> 10:17.184
Quiet, I can't hear
any breath sounds.

10:17.217 --> 10:18.318
Bag him again.

10:18.351 --> 10:19.953
Pressure's dropping
70 systolic.

10:19.987 --> 10:21.689
I need a first crit.
Tube is through the cords.

10:21.722 --> 10:22.856
I told you.
( alarm )

10:22.890 --> 10:23.957
Did we get a blood
line on him?

10:23.991 --> 10:25.759
You want to do it?
No, thanks.

10:25.793 --> 10:27.160
Did anyone
page Corday?
She's still next door.

10:27.194 --> 10:28.862
Does she need a
personal invite?

10:28.896 --> 10:30.030
Triple lumen kit
and size eight
sterile gloves.

10:30.063 --> 10:31.699
Pain is
non-reproducible.

10:31.732 --> 10:33.066
First it's here,
now it's here, here.

10:33.100 --> 10:34.902
That's not my fault?
Is there a problem?

10:34.935 --> 10:36.770
Mrs. Reynolds
had a subjective
fever last night.

10:36.804 --> 10:38.105
Which magically resolved,

10:38.138 --> 10:40.140
along with her abdominal pain,
after passing gas.

10:40.173 --> 10:42.743
You're going to charge
my insurance company 50 grand

10:42.776 --> 10:43.844
to tell me I needed to fart?

10:43.877 --> 10:44.945
Her belly
is definitely tender.

10:44.978 --> 10:46.814
There could be
a pusatile mass.

10:46.847 --> 10:48.849
So admit her
to service and
work her up.
Sorry.

10:48.882 --> 10:49.983
Elizabeth!

10:50.017 --> 10:50.984
Hey!

10:51.018 --> 10:53.186
Hey!

10:53.220 --> 10:55.055
Don't you "Hey" me.

10:55.088 --> 10:57.190
If you want to
get a CT scan and
re-consult me, fine.

10:57.224 --> 10:58.358
Or you can
send her home

10:58.391 --> 10:59.893
and bring her back
for a re-check,

10:59.927 --> 11:01.128
but I refuse
to admit her

11:01.161 --> 11:02.730
just so that you
can clear ER beds

11:02.730 --> 11:04.097
in 30 minutes.

11:04.131 --> 11:05.432
Dr. Corday, can you take a look
at this patient?

11:05.465 --> 11:07.234
( huffs )

11:07.267 --> 11:09.136
Let me guess--
infectious gangrene
from a paper cut?

11:09.169 --> 11:11.004
LEWIS:
I can't get a flash.
( whiny mimicking )

11:11.038 --> 11:12.405
B.P. 66 systolic.

11:12.439 --> 11:14.742
He's hypotensive.
His vasculature is collapsed.

11:16.443 --> 11:18.478
LEWIS:
He probably has
an intraabdominal hemorrhage.

11:18.511 --> 11:20.881
Tubed in the
field for LOC
but had belly pain.

11:20.914 --> 11:22.115
Another liter up.

11:22.149 --> 11:23.083
Ah, this clotted again.

11:23.116 --> 11:24.217
What's your excuse

11:24.251 --> 11:25.385
for not taking this
one up, Lizzie?

11:25.418 --> 11:26.253
No exposed bowel?

11:26.286 --> 11:27.755
Give it a rest, Robert.

11:27.755 --> 11:28.889
He's got
intraperitoneal fluid.

11:28.922 --> 11:30.190
All bleeding
eventually stops.

11:30.223 --> 11:32.125
You can probably leave
this one here, too.

11:32.159 --> 11:36.063
KOVAC:
O-silk and op site.
Hook up the infuser.

11:36.096 --> 11:37.765
This isn't working.
We only have
so many rooms.

11:37.798 --> 11:38.799
I'm going to
do a cut down.

11:38.832 --> 11:40.133
( alarm )

11:40.167 --> 11:41.769
He's slowing down.
Pulse is 72.

11:41.802 --> 11:43.070
He's going
to need a box if

11:43.103 --> 11:44.104
you guys don't
pull it together.

11:44.137 --> 11:44.872
Sats are 80.

11:44.905 --> 11:46.073
Run in the blood,

11:46.106 --> 11:48.075
and get a post-line chest.

11:48.108 --> 11:50.978
ROMANO:
All right, enough

11:51.011 --> 11:52.512
Did you even listen
to his lungs?
Yes!

11:52.545 --> 11:54.214
He's not moving
much air in this,

11:54.247 --> 11:56.049
other one's worse.
Tension pneumo on the right.

11:56.083 --> 11:57.184
Decreased on the right
with tracheal shift.

11:57.217 --> 11:58.986
Chest tube tray?

11:59.019 --> 12:00.788
Left lung's still up.
It's not from your line.

12:00.821 --> 12:02.022
Probably the intubation.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.090
We don't know that.

12:03.123 --> 12:04.257
They should have heard it

12:04.291 --> 12:05.926
in the helicopter
and needled it.

12:05.959 --> 12:07.494
Betadine. Even if they did,
and I'm not--

12:07.527 --> 12:09.329
saying they did--
you can't hear anything

12:09.362 --> 12:10.230
in those choppers.

12:10.263 --> 12:11.431
Knife.

12:12.299 --> 12:13.200
Abby, watch

12:13.233 --> 12:14.101
what you're doing.

12:14.134 --> 12:14.968
I didn't drop it.

12:15.002 --> 12:15.803
You did.

12:17.204 --> 12:18.071
Could you step outside,

12:18.105 --> 12:19.372
please?
Thank you.

12:19.406 --> 12:21.008
KOVAC:
She's just
observing.

12:21.041 --> 12:23.010
Well, I have enough people
in here just observing.

12:23.043 --> 12:24.812
If you think
you can do it
all yourself,

12:24.812 --> 12:26.013
Susan, we can
all step out.

12:26.046 --> 12:27.414
LEWIS:
Might go faster.

12:27.447 --> 12:28.515
Might go a lot faster

12:28.548 --> 12:29.917
if he came in
properly intubated.

12:29.950 --> 12:31.218
I'm glad to see
your morale boosting

12:31.251 --> 12:32.953
and leadership skills
are rubbing off.

12:32.986 --> 12:35.255
How do you say
"Bite my big one"
in Croatian?

12:35.288 --> 12:37.524
He's bradying down,
if anybody's interested.

12:40.393 --> 12:43.196
CARTER:
Take a deep
breath for me.

12:43.230 --> 12:44.297
Is there any
pain with that?

12:44.331 --> 12:45.332
No.

12:45.365 --> 12:46.834
Is that Blumberg's sign?

12:46.867 --> 12:48.235
No, Murphy's sign
for chololithiasis.

12:48.268 --> 12:49.970
Do you think he has
diverticulitis?
No.

12:50.003 --> 12:51.905
But the pain's in
the left lower quadrant.

12:51.939 --> 12:52.940
He's too young.

12:52.973 --> 12:53.907
What about
a kidney stone?

12:53.941 --> 12:54.975
It causes
a lot more pain.

12:55.008 --> 12:56.076
Ulcerative colitis?

12:56.109 --> 12:57.044
Gives you
bloody diarrhea.

12:57.077 --> 12:58.345
With the previous appy,

12:58.378 --> 12:59.913
should you worry about
intestinal obstruction?

12:59.947 --> 13:01.982
Maybe, but there's
no vomiting.

13:02.015 --> 13:04.417
What about
a femoral hernia?
No mass.

13:04.451 --> 13:05.986
Don't you have
a question?

13:06.019 --> 13:07.087
We get a lunch break?

13:07.120 --> 13:08.221
Are you going to do
a rectal?

13:08.255 --> 13:09.389
Eventually.

13:09.422 --> 13:10.858
I've never done
a rectal.

13:10.858 --> 13:12.192
What about ultrasounding
the belly?

13:12.225 --> 13:13.961
Okay, you and you
are shortness of breath.

13:13.994 --> 13:14.862
You and you,

13:14.895 --> 13:15.963
take vertigo.

13:15.996 --> 13:17.197
And last but not least,
knee pain.

13:17.230 --> 13:18.866
Watch each other
do an H&P,

13:18.899 --> 13:20.901
discuss the case
with your partner,

13:20.934 --> 13:21.869
present
back to me.

13:21.869 --> 13:23.003
Should we start...?

13:23.036 --> 13:24.972
Da, da, da, da,
no more questions.

13:27.540 --> 13:30.010
Thanks, they were giving me
a headache.

13:30.043 --> 13:31.444
Me, too.
Hey, Pratt.

13:31.478 --> 13:32.946
I got something for you.

13:32.980 --> 13:34.514
I'm seeing too many
patients already.

13:34.547 --> 13:36.016
Not a patient.

13:36.049 --> 13:37.951
Gallant, I got something
for you, too.

13:37.985 --> 13:38.919
What's this?

13:38.952 --> 13:40.053
You forget what today is?

13:40.087 --> 13:40.921
What? Payday?

13:40.954 --> 13:41.955
Ooh, match day.

13:41.989 --> 13:43.957
Good luck, gentlemen.

13:43.991 --> 13:45.893
I thought you matched
here already.

13:45.893 --> 13:48.361
No, man, I was just doing
a one-year transitional.

13:48.395 --> 13:50.630
I got County.

13:50.663 --> 13:52.132
Oh, man, I'm
sorry about that.

13:52.165 --> 13:53.967
Oh, no, man,
I asked for County.

13:54.001 --> 13:54.902
Why?

13:54.935 --> 13:56.036
Congratulations,
Gallant.

13:56.069 --> 13:57.104
Glad you're going
to be with us.

13:57.137 --> 13:58.405
Come on, come on.

13:58.438 --> 14:00.974
Talk to me, baby,
talk to me, talk to me.

14:02.609 --> 14:05.445
( laughing )

14:05.478 --> 14:07.180
I got Northwestern, baby.

14:07.214 --> 14:08.381
I'm going uptown.

14:08.415 --> 14:11.218
( laughing )

14:11.251 --> 14:12.252
What's this?

14:12.285 --> 14:14.021
LOL with phlebitis in Exam Four.

14:14.054 --> 14:16.089
Do you know
how many patients
I'm juggling?

14:16.123 --> 14:18.491
Not enough if
you have time for
dancing in the hall.

14:18.525 --> 14:19.993
( sighs )

14:20.027 --> 14:21.028
How much out the right tube?

14:21.061 --> 14:22.095
Nearly 600 cc's.

14:22.129 --> 14:23.931
B.P.'s up to 92/66.

14:23.931 --> 14:25.933
Let's hope his brain survived
the lack of perfusion.

14:25.933 --> 14:27.267
Can you tell me
where curtain two is?

14:27.300 --> 14:28.435
You just passed it.

14:28.468 --> 14:30.003
Oh, nurse,
could I ask you a question?

14:30.037 --> 14:31.939
In a minute.

14:31.939 --> 14:33.473
Did my brother call back?

14:33.506 --> 14:35.342
I thought he disappeared.

14:35.375 --> 14:36.944
Where's Jerry?

14:36.944 --> 14:38.345
On his break.

14:38.378 --> 14:39.579
E.R. Hold, please.

14:39.612 --> 14:40.580
That him?

14:40.613 --> 14:43.250
No.

14:43.283 --> 14:45.385
Could you tell Dr.
Kovac I'm leaving?

14:45.418 --> 14:46.954
He should be back in a minute.

14:46.987 --> 14:48.321
We just sent that trauma
upstairs.

14:48.355 --> 14:51.058
And I'm Abby,
by the way.

14:51.091 --> 14:52.292
Dr. Horvat.

14:52.325 --> 14:53.493
Hi.
Hi.

14:53.526 --> 14:54.962
You know Luka from Croatia?

14:54.995 --> 14:56.163
We're old friends.

14:56.196 --> 14:58.031
We went to
school together.

14:58.065 --> 15:01.068
He was what you call
a character back then.

15:01.101 --> 15:02.269
Luka?

15:02.302 --> 15:04.471
Oh, yes. Always playing
practical jokes

15:04.504 --> 15:06.006
on the other students

15:06.039 --> 15:06.539
and our professors.

15:06.573 --> 15:08.308
Really?

15:08.341 --> 15:11.144
You could always
tell when Luka was
in the building

15:11.178 --> 15:13.080
because you'd
hear him laughing.

15:13.113 --> 15:16.016
You know that
laugh of his.
It's contagious.

15:16.049 --> 15:20.153
He doesn't really
laugh much at work.

15:20.187 --> 15:22.622
He seems like he's changed.

15:22.655 --> 15:25.092
He's been through a lot,
I guess.

15:25.125 --> 15:27.060
Still, I thought I'd find him

15:27.094 --> 15:29.729
married to some
American supermodel

15:29.762 --> 15:32.065
with three children
and a dog.

15:32.099 --> 15:35.668
His wife, Danijela,
would have wanted that.

15:35.702 --> 15:37.537
LEWIS:
Abby, page Psych again.

15:37.570 --> 15:39.539
They got to see this guy.
Okay.

15:39.572 --> 15:41.641
Excuse me.

15:41.674 --> 15:43.010
He's getting restless.

15:43.010 --> 15:44.344
Give him some more Haldol.
Okay.

15:44.377 --> 15:46.079
Do I need
to apologize to her?

15:46.113 --> 15:47.314
No, she seems pretty cool.

15:47.347 --> 15:48.615
Then I'll apologize to you.

15:48.648 --> 15:50.250
Sorry, I didn't mean
to turn into a bitch

15:50.283 --> 15:51.384
in that trauma room.

15:51.418 --> 15:52.352
No, don't worry about it.

15:52.385 --> 15:53.353
I was a little unfocused.

15:53.386 --> 15:55.222
Did you talk
to your brother?

15:55.255 --> 15:57.290
No. He said he was
going to call back,
but he didn't.

15:57.324 --> 16:00.360
Guys never call
when you want them to.

16:00.393 --> 16:01.594
Hey, did air rescue leave yet?

16:01.628 --> 16:03.296
What am I, air
traffic control now?

16:03.330 --> 16:04.731
Why don't you use the
helicopter check system?

16:04.764 --> 16:06.066
What's that?

16:06.099 --> 16:07.534
Go up on the roof
and check.

16:07.567 --> 16:09.702
If the helicopter
isn't there, they left.

16:09.736 --> 16:12.072
Frank, are you taking anything
for your cholesterol?

16:12.105 --> 16:13.240
No.
Good.

16:13.273 --> 16:15.142
Hey, can you call
Dr. Meyers in Psych

16:15.175 --> 16:18.045
and tell him I'm sending
a psychotic patient
up to his office

16:18.078 --> 16:20.280
if he doesn't come down here
and assess this guy.

16:20.313 --> 16:21.314
( heavy breathing )

16:21.348 --> 16:22.382
How you doing, James?

16:22.415 --> 16:25.318
Oh, um, okay... I um...

16:25.352 --> 16:27.220
I need to go now,
'cause I...

16:27.254 --> 16:30.257
um, 'cause I can feel
the pulses.

16:30.290 --> 16:32.459
They're trying to use
the microwaves

16:32.492 --> 16:34.194
to penetrate
my synaptic code.

16:34.227 --> 16:36.129
Okay, James, you need
to relax, all right?

16:36.163 --> 16:37.797
Okay.

16:37.830 --> 16:40.267
I'm going to give you some
medicine to help you do that.

16:40.300 --> 16:41.201
Okay.

16:41.234 --> 16:43.236
Okay. Okay...

16:43.270 --> 16:44.304
( grunting )

16:44.337 --> 16:45.405
( yells )

16:45.438 --> 16:47.440
No! Wait! No! Wait!

16:47.474 --> 16:49.776
( groaning loudly )

16:49.809 --> 16:51.811
Okay, stop it.

16:51.844 --> 16:52.645
James...

16:52.679 --> 16:54.347
look at me.

16:54.381 --> 16:57.817
James, James, you know
I'm not trying to hurt you.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.819
( heavy breathing )

16:59.852 --> 17:01.588
I'm keeping you safe.

17:01.621 --> 17:03.456
That's what I do.

17:03.490 --> 17:05.192
Abby, your brother's
on line one.

17:05.224 --> 17:06.693
Oh, yeah, thanks.

17:08.494 --> 17:12.332
( breathing slows )

17:25.178 --> 17:27.446
Eric?

17:27.480 --> 17:29.749
Where are you?

17:31.184 --> 17:33.720
Are you okay?

17:33.753 --> 17:36.823
Well, what's going on? I...

17:36.856 --> 17:39.126
Yes, he's here.

17:39.159 --> 17:41.128
We caught him.

17:41.128 --> 17:42.562
We have no
other choice.

17:42.595 --> 17:44.564
He's not cooperating.

17:44.597 --> 17:46.199
He knows things.
We have to proceed

17:46.233 --> 17:48.801
with the surgical
interrogation.

17:48.835 --> 17:51.504
Okay, are you on your meds?

17:53.173 --> 17:54.607
Well, why didn't you go
to a hospital?

17:54.641 --> 17:55.708
Okay, okay.

17:55.742 --> 17:57.344
Well, what's the phone number

17:57.377 --> 17:59.512
of the... of the booth
y-you're using?

18:01.814 --> 18:03.650
Stop talking to them!

18:03.683 --> 18:04.851
I won't let you...

18:04.884 --> 18:07.487
( loud mumbling )

18:07.520 --> 18:10.157
( fire alarm blares )

18:10.190 --> 18:12.359
( James screaming )

18:14.694 --> 18:16.596
( screaming continues )

18:18.531 --> 18:21.368
Frank, call security
and cancel the fire alarm.

18:21.401 --> 18:24.337
( James screaming )

18:34.914 --> 18:37.750
James!

18:37.784 --> 18:40.653
Look out, look out, look out.

18:53.966 --> 18:57.370
( alarm continues blaring )

18:57.404 --> 18:59.406
Hey, just hang out,
I'll be right back.

18:59.439 --> 19:00.773
When are they going
to stop this?

19:00.807 --> 19:02.409
Well, usually it
doesn't take more than

19:02.442 --> 19:03.543
four or five hours.

19:03.576 --> 19:04.544
( snickers )

19:04.577 --> 19:06.246
You think I'm kidding?

19:06.279 --> 19:08.781
Now you see why I want to get
the hell out of this place.

19:08.815 --> 19:09.816
Well, it's not all bad.

19:09.849 --> 19:11.384
You know what I mean.

19:11.418 --> 19:13.420
You know, you can get a job
at Northwestern, too.

19:13.453 --> 19:15.222
I left County once,
but I came back.

19:15.222 --> 19:17.224
Something about this place
just gets in your blood.

19:17.257 --> 19:18.825
Uh. ( chuckles )
It's probably the asbestos.

19:18.858 --> 19:20.360
( chuckles )

19:20.393 --> 19:23.263
So, you want to help me
celebrate later or what?

19:23.296 --> 19:25.365
What do you
have in mind?

19:25.398 --> 19:27.967
Hey, Dr. Chen,
she spiked a fever.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.869
Oh, am I...
am I interrupting something?

19:29.902 --> 19:31.704
Yeah.
No.

19:31.738 --> 19:32.905
Listen, Mona Reynolds,

19:32.939 --> 19:35.408
she dropped her pressure
in the CT scan,

19:35.442 --> 19:36.609
and her temp's 39.6.

19:36.643 --> 19:37.644
Find me later?

19:37.677 --> 19:38.645
Her white count's 22.

19:38.678 --> 19:39.712
She's in a lot of pain.

19:39.746 --> 19:41.248
I paged Romano.

19:41.248 --> 19:42.882
How are we doing,
Mrs. Reynolds?

19:42.915 --> 19:44.551
( groaning ):
My gut's gonna bust!

19:44.584 --> 19:47.287
Let me guess, she ruptured her
intraperitoneal pus.

19:47.320 --> 19:48.955
GALLANT:
Pressure's 86/60.

19:48.988 --> 19:50.623
We're going to need
another liter. She's septic.

19:50.657 --> 19:52.325
Yeah, courtesy of Dr. Corday.

19:52.359 --> 19:55.562
( groaning ):
Oh, my gut's killing me!

19:55.595 --> 19:56.829
Yes, it will if we don't fix it.

19:56.863 --> 19:58.665
( gags )

19:58.698 --> 20:00.400
( coughs )

20:00.433 --> 20:02.569
A simple please and thank you
would have sufficed.

20:02.602 --> 20:07.006
Okay, let's grab
a two-gram dose of cefoxitin.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.675
A gram of P.R. Tylenol

20:08.708 --> 20:09.709
and four of M.S.

20:09.742 --> 20:11.511
Should I page
Dr. Corday?

20:11.544 --> 20:13.513
Screw that. If she can't
diagnose a subphrenic abscess,

20:13.546 --> 20:14.881
she sure as hell can't fix one.

20:14.914 --> 20:16.483
You know, you should
get a clean dressing.

20:16.516 --> 20:17.884
Just grab me a 4x4.

20:19.552 --> 20:21.354
Whoa. Ulcer looks necrotic.

20:21.388 --> 20:22.422
You need to get that

20:22.455 --> 20:23.956
debrided.

20:23.990 --> 20:26.025
If I were you two, I would
concentrate on my patient.

20:26.058 --> 20:28.261
She has a history of
peptic ulcer disease,

20:28.295 --> 20:29.729
perforation two years ago,

20:29.762 --> 20:31.564
chronic subclinical fevers,
weight loss, cough--

20:31.598 --> 20:32.899
it's classic.

20:32.932 --> 20:34.467
We still have to page Corday
to book an O.R.

20:34.501 --> 20:35.435
Forget it.

20:35.468 --> 20:37.270
She's already septic.

20:37.304 --> 20:38.938
Open drainage
could kill her.
We'll have to this

20:38.971 --> 20:40.006
under ultrasound.

20:40.039 --> 20:41.574
Set her up in Trauma Two.

20:41.608 --> 20:42.942
( coughs )

20:42.975 --> 20:44.344
Short of breath, history of CHF,

20:44.377 --> 20:45.945
noncompliant
with meds and diet.

20:45.978 --> 20:46.879
Wet crackles on exam.

20:46.913 --> 20:48.014
Orders?

20:48.047 --> 20:50.583
CBC, chem panel,
40 of lasix,

20:50.617 --> 20:52.419
chest X ray and EKG.

20:52.452 --> 20:53.420
Great.

20:53.453 --> 20:54.787
Good. Next.

20:54.821 --> 20:56.889
Positional Vertigo with
positive berene test.

20:56.923 --> 20:58.325
How's the cerebellar
function?

20:58.358 --> 21:00.593
FNF, HTS, and R.A.M. all normal.

21:00.627 --> 21:02.762
Ma'am, can you go
like this?

21:02.795 --> 21:04.331
Good.

21:04.364 --> 21:08.501
Hep lock, five of Compazine,
five of Valium. Next.

21:08.535 --> 21:10.637
Knee pain.
History of rheumatoid arthritis.

21:10.670 --> 21:12.038
No trauma or calf tenderness.

21:12.071 --> 21:13.840
We're thinking
ruptured baker cyst.

21:13.873 --> 21:15.007
Dr. Carter,
telephone call.

21:15.041 --> 21:16.576
Okay, just a sec.

21:16.609 --> 21:17.344
What did you order?

21:17.344 --> 21:18.611
Ultrasound.

21:18.645 --> 21:19.912
MALIK:
Hey, Carter,
your old guy

21:19.946 --> 21:21.047
just coded.

21:21.080 --> 21:22.549
All right, 600 ibuprofen.

21:22.582 --> 21:23.816
Jerry, take a message.

21:23.850 --> 21:25.885
Uh, I'm sorry,
he's with a patient.

21:25.918 --> 21:26.819
Can I take a message?

21:26.853 --> 21:28.621
Uh, just a second.

21:28.655 --> 21:31.624
Dr. Weaver, can you take
this telephone call
for Dr. Carter?

21:31.658 --> 21:32.525
He's running a code.

21:32.559 --> 21:34.361
They say it's urgent.

21:34.394 --> 21:35.795
Yeah, this is Kerry Weaver,
Dr. Carter's supervisor.

21:35.828 --> 21:37.364
What's the problem?

21:37.364 --> 21:38.931
Turn up the suction.
He's throwing PVCs.

21:38.965 --> 21:41.033
Increase crichoid pressure.
You want Lidocaine?

21:41.067 --> 21:42.469
Not just yet.

21:42.502 --> 21:44.036
I got it, I'm in.
Bag him.

21:44.070 --> 21:45.938
Carter, you got a phone call.
I'll take this.

21:45.972 --> 21:47.640
I'm okay.
I got this.
Sats are coming up.

21:47.674 --> 21:49.075
John, you really need
to take this call.

21:49.108 --> 21:50.042
He's in V-tach.

21:50.076 --> 21:51.878
All right, charge to 200.

21:51.911 --> 21:53.980
It's your grandmother.
Good pulse with
compressions.

21:54.013 --> 21:56.015
John...

21:56.048 --> 21:57.450
Charge.

21:57.484 --> 21:58.585
Uh, okay, clear.

21:58.618 --> 21:59.486
Still in V-tach.

21:59.519 --> 22:00.753
What did I say? 200?

22:00.787 --> 22:02.054
Charge to 300,
and give me an amp of epi.

22:02.088 --> 22:03.756
I'm sorry.

22:03.790 --> 22:04.824
Is she dead?

22:04.857 --> 22:06.125
I'm sorry.

22:06.158 --> 22:08.127
Charge.

22:08.160 --> 22:09.596
Clear.

22:14.567 --> 22:15.602
Still
in fib.
360.

22:15.635 --> 22:16.569
How long do you
keep trying?

22:16.603 --> 22:17.537
CARTER:
And clear.

22:17.570 --> 22:18.505
Another amp of epi.

22:18.538 --> 22:19.772
It's been
25 minutes.

22:19.806 --> 22:21.574
Does anyone survive
after this long?

22:21.608 --> 22:22.141
Hold compressions.

22:22.174 --> 22:23.676
Fine v fib.

22:23.710 --> 22:25.678
Resume compressions.
Charge again to 360.

22:25.712 --> 22:26.546
What else can you try?

22:26.579 --> 22:27.647
Procainamide-- one gram,

22:27.680 --> 22:28.748
30 migs per minute.

22:28.781 --> 22:29.716
Is that okay
with lidocaine

22:29.749 --> 22:31.584
and amiodarone?
Clear.

22:31.618 --> 22:33.520
What's the most times
you've ever shocked somebody?

22:33.553 --> 22:36.022
Still no change.
360 one more time.

22:36.055 --> 22:37.757
But I thought
if you don't get them back

22:37.790 --> 22:39.526
after three shocks,
you never will.

22:39.559 --> 22:41.594
And clear.

22:41.628 --> 22:42.762
Well, I guess
you heard wrong.

22:42.795 --> 22:43.896
Sinus tach.

22:43.930 --> 22:45.031
Good carotid pulse.

22:45.064 --> 22:46.766
Let's finish the pronestyl load

22:46.799 --> 22:48.901
and start a drip
at five per minute.

22:48.935 --> 22:50.570
Pupils are fixed
and dilated.

22:50.603 --> 22:51.971
Is he ever going
to wake up?

22:52.004 --> 22:55.007
Well, let's just wait and see.

22:55.041 --> 22:56.943
ABG on 100%. AC 14.

22:56.976 --> 22:59.111
Tidal volume of 700.

23:35.582 --> 23:37.049
Abby, I told you
not to call DCFS

23:37.083 --> 23:38.050
on the baby Miles case.

23:38.084 --> 23:39.018
I didn't.

23:39.051 --> 23:40.487
I called a social worker.

23:40.520 --> 23:42.522
Mom looked like
she could use some help.

23:42.555 --> 23:43.690
Yeah, and Adele
called DCFS.

23:43.723 --> 23:44.724
Hey, did you
find him?

23:44.757 --> 23:45.658
Who?
No.

23:45.692 --> 23:46.959
She lost
a psych patient.

23:46.993 --> 23:48.194
I was in the process
of restraining him

23:48.227 --> 23:49.529
when he bolted.

23:49.562 --> 23:50.997
Wait, did you
call Security?

23:51.030 --> 23:52.832
He had already left
the building.

23:52.865 --> 23:55.802
Frank, could you get me
an address on this phone number?

23:55.835 --> 23:57.203
Is this patient
a threat?

23:57.236 --> 23:58.505
I don't know.
Where is this?

23:58.538 --> 23:59.839
It's a phone booth.

24:01.173 --> 24:02.575
Chuck.

24:02.609 --> 24:04.110
Are you leaving?

24:04.143 --> 24:06.112
Yeah. How's
the patient?

24:06.145 --> 24:07.213
He went upstairs.

24:07.246 --> 24:08.247
Hopefully
he's not brain dead

24:08.280 --> 24:09.749
from the prolonged
hypotension.

24:09.782 --> 24:11.150
It was a good
intubation, Sooze.

24:11.183 --> 24:12.051
You saw it.

24:12.084 --> 24:13.019
One, call me Susan,

24:13.052 --> 24:14.220
and two,
his lung was down.

24:14.253 --> 24:15.955
Look, do you know
how hard it is

24:15.988 --> 24:18.124
to hear anything
on that chopper,
with the rotors

24:18.157 --> 24:19.892
and the vibration
in the headphones?

24:21.260 --> 24:22.795
I do know, but...

24:22.829 --> 24:25.264
Look, that lung was up
when I transported him.

24:25.297 --> 24:26.866
He had a tension pneumo.

24:26.899 --> 24:28.067
You should have caught it.

24:28.100 --> 24:28.935
You didn't.

24:28.968 --> 24:30.169
I stood up for you.

24:30.202 --> 24:32.071
What the hell's
that supposed to mean?

24:32.104 --> 24:33.540
I don't need you
standing up for me.

24:33.540 --> 24:35.041
What, you felt like you had to

24:35.074 --> 24:36.976
because I'm a nurse
and you're a doctor?

24:37.009 --> 24:39.245
No, that is not it.

24:40.780 --> 24:42.281
Well, maybe a little.

24:42.314 --> 24:44.116
I know how they bag

24:44.150 --> 24:45.151
on the EMTs.

24:45.184 --> 24:47.086
( laughing softly )

24:48.688 --> 24:49.956
What is so funny?

24:49.989 --> 24:51.190
Nothing. We just...

24:51.223 --> 24:52.792
We bag on doctors all the time.

24:52.825 --> 24:54.226
( chuckling )

24:54.260 --> 24:56.128
You're protecting me.

24:56.162 --> 24:59.298
Oh, you're too much, Dr. Lewis.

24:59.331 --> 25:00.600
Chuck.

25:00.633 --> 25:02.034
Yeah?

25:02.068 --> 25:03.235
Chuck.

25:03.269 --> 25:05.572
Susan.

25:05.572 --> 25:06.839
Charles.
Susan.

25:06.873 --> 25:09.241
There's a dead body in here.

25:09.275 --> 25:10.577
I don't mind.

25:10.577 --> 25:12.244
( laughs ):
It's gross.

25:12.278 --> 25:14.981
It's disrespectful.

25:15.014 --> 25:16.616
It's wrong.

25:19.686 --> 25:23.055
Um, sorry, I-I was
looking for Carter.

25:23.089 --> 25:24.591
Um, he was just
here, wasn't he?

25:24.624 --> 25:25.758
Yeah.

25:25.792 --> 25:26.993
Yeah, but, um, he left.

25:27.026 --> 25:30.597
Okay.

25:30.597 --> 25:32.198
Was that a dead body
in there?

25:32.231 --> 25:35.334
American doctors can
be very unprofessional.

25:35.367 --> 25:36.703
Kovac, uh, you ever drain

25:36.736 --> 25:38.270
an intraperitoneal
abscess?

25:38.304 --> 25:40.339
That's a surgical procedure.
I'm talking to her.

25:40.372 --> 25:41.207
You're a surgeon?

25:41.240 --> 25:42.609
Yes.

25:42.642 --> 25:44.043
Good, come with me, now, now.

25:44.076 --> 25:45.277
I got a
septic patient

25:45.311 --> 25:46.946
moments away from
full-blown badness.

25:46.979 --> 25:48.347
I need you to help
me put a catheter

25:48.380 --> 25:50.617
in a pocket of pus
under ultrasonic guidance.

25:50.650 --> 25:51.651
Think you
can do that?

25:51.684 --> 25:52.619
Perhaps, but...
Good.

25:52.619 --> 25:53.620
Pressure's better.

25:53.653 --> 25:54.821
110/72 after the second liter.

25:54.854 --> 25:55.788
What's her temp?
Still 39.

25:55.822 --> 25:56.956
Cefoxitin
running in.

25:56.989 --> 25:58.124
Good. I need you
to sign this.

25:58.157 --> 25:59.626
( crying ):
What is it?

25:59.659 --> 26:00.960
It's a consent
for the procedure.

26:00.993 --> 26:01.828
What happens if I don't?

26:01.861 --> 26:03.095
You'll probably die.

26:03.129 --> 26:04.931
I don't think
I should do this.

26:04.964 --> 26:06.699
It'll be okay.
I'll help you.

26:06.733 --> 26:07.366
What are they saying?

26:07.399 --> 26:08.835
Pillow talk.

26:08.868 --> 26:10.703
The kidney stone
in Two is pain free.

26:10.737 --> 26:13.172
You can send him
home with vicodin
and a strainer.

26:13.205 --> 26:14.641
Uh, Eleanor Carter.

26:14.674 --> 26:16.242
It might be under
Eleanor Ferguson.

26:16.275 --> 26:18.377
Mrs. Drummond can
have ten of compazine.

26:18.410 --> 26:21.247
She can come back tomorrow
if the pain persists.

26:21.280 --> 26:23.215
Okay. What about the kid in,
uh, Curtain Three?

26:23.249 --> 26:25.251
Dr. Lewis can take care
of everybody else.

26:25.284 --> 26:26.385
Okay. Hey, you all right?

26:26.418 --> 26:27.787
Yeah, I'll
be all right.

26:27.820 --> 26:28.821
Thanks, Malik.
Yeah.

26:28.855 --> 26:31.323
Uh, can you check again for me?

26:31.357 --> 26:35.127
Hello? Hello?

26:35.161 --> 26:36.328
Pressure's steady.
100 systolic.

26:36.362 --> 26:37.664
Has anybody seen Abby?

26:37.664 --> 26:38.297
No, sorry.

26:38.330 --> 26:39.732
Finder needle.

26:39.766 --> 26:41.200
Try not to perforate
the diaphragm.

26:41.233 --> 26:42.201
CARTER:
What are you doing?

26:42.234 --> 26:43.269
What does it look like?

26:43.302 --> 26:45.004
A lawsuit.

26:45.037 --> 26:46.038
Advancing.

26:46.072 --> 26:47.006
No aspiration.

26:47.039 --> 26:48.374
You're doing good.

26:48.407 --> 26:50.276
Sorry to hear
about your grandmother, Carter.

26:50.309 --> 26:51.778
Thank you.
Um, I need to go home.

26:51.811 --> 26:53.212
Susan's going to cover for me.

26:53.245 --> 26:55.114
How old was she?

26:55.147 --> 26:56.315
78.

26:56.348 --> 26:58.217
We should all be
so lucky.

26:58.250 --> 27:00.086
Okay, there's pus.
Now pull out more.
Good. Wire.

27:00.119 --> 27:01.253
Uh, fine,
go ahead.

27:01.287 --> 27:02.321
A couple
more Croatians,

27:02.354 --> 27:03.322
I could clean house
around here.

27:03.355 --> 27:04.323
Trocar and pigtail.

27:04.356 --> 27:05.692
Be right back.

27:05.725 --> 27:07.226
Pull the needle out,
and put the Trocar

27:07.259 --> 27:08.795
right over
the wire.

27:08.828 --> 27:10.062
Hey, Carter.

27:10.096 --> 27:12.131
Do you know anyone
in the State Department?

27:12.164 --> 27:12.965
Um, why?

27:12.999 --> 27:14.300
Uh, my friend Gordana

27:14.333 --> 27:16.335
is trying to get a little boy
into this country

27:16.368 --> 27:18.705
for an operation, but there
is some sort of a problem.

27:18.738 --> 27:19.906
Luka,
I'm really sorry.

27:19.939 --> 27:21.708
I can't help you with this
right now.

27:23.275 --> 27:24.410
Jerry,
have you seen Abby?

27:24.443 --> 27:26.078
Nope.

27:26.112 --> 27:27.847
Can you find her
for me?

27:27.880 --> 27:29.148
Sure.

27:29.181 --> 27:31.083
Hey, Dad, it's me.

27:31.117 --> 27:32.952
No, I didn't get ahold of Mom.

27:32.985 --> 27:34.453
Yeah, are you sure

27:34.486 --> 27:37.757
that you're going to make
the 5:30 flight?

27:37.790 --> 27:40.459
Okay, well, no,
I'll just leave right from here

27:40.492 --> 27:43.129
to come to the airport
to pick you up.

27:43.162 --> 27:45.364
Okay.

27:45.397 --> 27:47.867
( sniffles ):
No, I'm good.

27:47.900 --> 27:50.236
Yeah, I know. Bye.

27:50.269 --> 27:51.470
I've been
looking for you.

27:51.503 --> 27:53.305
Hey, I've been looking
for you.

27:53.339 --> 27:55.174
Carter.
Got a 26-year-old with stridor

27:55.207 --> 27:56.342
in severe respiratory distress.

27:56.375 --> 27:57.844
I can't tube him.

27:57.877 --> 27:59.746
His epiglottis is
the size of my fist.

27:59.746 --> 28:00.980
All right, nothing's open.

28:01.013 --> 28:02.281
Put him in Three.

28:02.314 --> 28:04.216
Pre-Op labs,
blood cultures times two,

28:04.250 --> 28:06.986
soft tissue lateral of the neck,
three grams of Unasyn.

28:07.019 --> 28:08.087
Pulse ox is down to 85.

28:08.120 --> 28:09.421
He's barely
moving any air.

28:09.455 --> 28:11.323
I saw this guy today
for a sore throat.

28:11.357 --> 28:12.759
Romano told
me to turf him.

28:12.759 --> 28:14.060
CARTER:
One, two, three.

28:14.093 --> 28:15.294
We need a surgical airway.

28:15.327 --> 28:16.395
You ever do a crike before?

28:16.428 --> 28:17.429
No.

28:17.463 --> 28:18.430
Well, you're about to.

28:18.464 --> 28:19.498
Prep and drape the neck.

28:19.531 --> 28:21.033
Abby, can you open
a Melker kit?

28:21.067 --> 28:22.201
What comes next?

28:22.234 --> 28:23.402
Find the cricho-
thyroid space.

28:23.435 --> 28:25.171
Do it.

28:25.204 --> 28:27.239
Can you leave right after this?

28:27.273 --> 28:29.008
Yeah. I'm ready to go
right now.

28:29.041 --> 28:30.810
Angle the needle
at 45 degrees.

28:30.843 --> 28:31.911
Good,
'cause I really

28:31.944 --> 28:33.946
don't want to do this alone.

28:33.980 --> 28:35.347
Do what?

28:35.381 --> 28:37.049
CARTER:
Aspirate air.

28:37.083 --> 28:38.417
It's all the arrangements--

28:38.450 --> 28:40.319
just everything
that has to be taken care of.

28:40.352 --> 28:42.388
Guidewire next.

28:42.421 --> 28:43.823
What are you talking about?

28:43.856 --> 28:45.091
What are you
talking about?

28:45.124 --> 28:46.525
Where were you going?

28:46.558 --> 28:47.794
To get Eric.

28:47.827 --> 28:48.961
What?

28:48.995 --> 28:50.797
Needle out. 11 blade.

28:50.830 --> 28:52.298
Yeah, he called
from a truck stop

28:52.331 --> 28:53.499
outside of Des Moines.

28:53.532 --> 28:55.101
Just enough to pass
the introducer.

28:55.134 --> 28:56.936
Okay.

28:56.969 --> 28:57.870
When did this happen?

28:57.904 --> 28:59.305
This afternoon.

28:59.338 --> 29:01.373
Oh, and I need you
to write me a scrip for Depakote

29:01.407 --> 29:03.542
and Zyprexa.
( huffs )

29:03.575 --> 29:06.145
Introducer... out.

29:06.178 --> 29:07.814
Okay, bag him.

29:07.814 --> 29:09.982
Sats are coming up.

29:10.016 --> 29:12.018
Nice work, Pratt.

29:15.822 --> 29:17.523
What's wrong?

29:17.556 --> 29:20.827
My grandmother died today.

29:22.428 --> 29:26.132
Just didn't wake
up from her nap.

29:28.901 --> 29:30.136
Oh, Carter, I'm so sorry.

29:30.169 --> 29:31.270
No one told me.

29:31.303 --> 29:34.340
Hey, I got it.

29:34.373 --> 29:36.575
Let's get out
of here.

29:36.608 --> 29:41.948
Yeah, she called me,
like, three days...

29:41.981 --> 29:43.315
She was on some
new committee.

29:43.349 --> 29:45.351
She wanted me to
hear somebody speak

29:45.384 --> 29:47.353
about a wetlands
learning center.

29:47.386 --> 29:49.088
She knew I hated
that stuff.

29:49.121 --> 29:51.423
I think she just
wanted to see me.

29:51.457 --> 29:54.160
Well, you spent more time
with her than anybody.

29:54.193 --> 29:56.929
( sighs ):
She called again
last night,

29:56.963 --> 29:59.331
and I saw her number
on the caller ID,

29:59.365 --> 30:01.433
and I just... I
didn't pick it up.

30:01.467 --> 30:04.536
Well, she lived a very full
and happy life,

30:04.570 --> 30:07.073
and you were
a big part of that.

30:07.106 --> 30:09.341
She wasn't sick,
she wasn't in pain.

30:09.375 --> 30:10.609
she was in her own bed.

30:10.642 --> 30:12.411
That's not
a bad way to go.

30:14.146 --> 30:15.447
And I'll be back
tonight.

30:15.481 --> 30:16.883
The flight's
only an hour.

30:16.916 --> 30:18.150
Do you have to go?

30:18.184 --> 30:19.451
I mean, my
dad's flying in.

30:19.485 --> 30:21.854
I got to do all the
funeral arrangements.

30:21.888 --> 30:25.457
I just...
I have to go get him.

30:25.491 --> 30:27.393
Why? I mean, Eric's
been gone for weeks.

30:27.426 --> 30:28.360
What's one more day?

30:28.394 --> 30:29.996
He's off his meds,

30:30.029 --> 30:32.865
and if I don't go now,
he might disappear again.

30:36.502 --> 30:39.005
I'll be back tonight.

30:39.038 --> 30:40.306
John...
Go.

30:40.339 --> 30:41.440
Go find your brother.

30:41.473 --> 30:42.975
My grandmother
will still be dead

30:43.009 --> 30:47.346
when you get back.

30:48.580 --> 30:51.317
Well, what should
I tell Dr. Corday?

30:51.350 --> 30:53.152
That she's welcome,
and that the least she can do

30:53.185 --> 30:54.520
is admit this patient
to surgical ICU.

30:54.553 --> 30:56.588
Good God,
it's the Stepford children.

30:56.622 --> 30:57.356
Where's your handler?

30:57.389 --> 30:59.058
Dr. Carter said

30:59.091 --> 31:01.627
you'd be shepherding us
for the rest of the shift.

31:01.660 --> 31:04.430
Oh, well, isn't he generous
with my life. Come on.

31:04.463 --> 31:06.298
Wean him down to 50%
and check a gas in an hour.

31:06.332 --> 31:08.434
Dr. Pratt, how would you like
to present some cases

31:08.467 --> 31:09.601
to the future of medicine?

31:09.635 --> 31:10.669
No, thanks.
It was not a request.

31:10.702 --> 31:12.338
Okay, everyone,
listen up.

31:12.371 --> 31:14.941
This is what happens when
your chief forces you

31:14.941 --> 31:17.443
to clear beds at the cost
of proper examination.

31:17.476 --> 31:20.646
Even a sore throat can result
in a near mortality.

31:20.679 --> 31:23.482
Now, this particular
patient came in

31:23.515 --> 31:25.952
complaining of odynophagia.

31:25.952 --> 31:27.019
WOMAN:
It hurts to swallow.

31:27.053 --> 31:28.620
I checked this guy's throat.

31:28.654 --> 31:31.490
( laughs ):
See, posterior pharynx
looks benign...

31:31.523 --> 31:33.692
but when pain
is out of proportion to exam,

31:33.725 --> 31:35.962
one must then visualize
the epiglottis,

31:35.995 --> 31:38.164
either with a lateral X ray
of the neck

31:38.197 --> 31:41.133
or by looking down the throat
with a fiber-optic scope

31:41.167 --> 31:42.534
or a right-angled mirror.

31:42.568 --> 31:44.170
I can't help it
if the guy's a wimp.

31:44.203 --> 31:46.238
Epiglottitis is a
pediatric illness, junior.

31:46.272 --> 31:47.706
Maybe back in the day,

31:47.739 --> 31:50.376
but we tend to see it in adults
now more and more...

31:50.409 --> 31:53.179
if one takes the time
to look for it.

31:53.212 --> 31:54.480
I had to crike this guy.

31:54.513 --> 31:56.115
Well, good for you.

31:56.148 --> 31:57.549
Don't ever do this.

31:57.583 --> 32:00.119
Get out, now. Let's go.
Move. Move now, move!

32:00.152 --> 32:01.687
What's the matter
with you?

32:01.720 --> 32:03.389
Get out of here!

32:09.195 --> 32:10.462
Congratulations, smart ass.

32:10.496 --> 32:12.531
You just bought yourself
a month of midnights.

32:15.634 --> 32:18.037
Good. I love the nightlife.

32:23.075 --> 32:24.610
Where's your friend?

32:24.643 --> 32:26.545
Dr. Horvat left.

32:26.578 --> 32:29.415
I heard Romano had
her doing surgery
in the Trauma Room.

32:29.448 --> 32:31.617
She drained an abscess.
It wasn't a big deal.

32:31.650 --> 32:33.452
Unless there are
complications.

32:33.485 --> 32:35.554
Uh, look,

32:35.587 --> 32:38.390
I think you may
have gotten the
wrong impression

32:38.424 --> 32:39.558
today in Exam Four,

32:39.591 --> 32:41.460
when you were
looking for Carter.

32:41.493 --> 32:43.495
You mean,
with the flight nurse?

32:43.529 --> 32:45.497
Chuck, and technically,
we're married.

32:45.531 --> 32:47.399
Oh, so it's technically okay

32:47.433 --> 32:49.601
to boff your husband
in the hospital?

32:49.635 --> 32:52.304
We weren't boffing.
We were talking.

32:52.338 --> 32:54.106
( laughing ):
Good night, Susan.

32:54.140 --> 32:55.641
It's still not the same
as a patient's mother.

32:55.674 --> 32:58.444
Hey, at least
I used an empty room.

33:00.646 --> 33:02.048
Oh.

33:04.183 --> 33:06.718
Uh, thank you.

33:06.752 --> 33:08.487
What are you
still doing here?

33:08.520 --> 33:11.157
I'm, uh, picking up my dad
at the airport before I go home.

33:11.190 --> 33:13.759
Good. Do you remember
any genetic disorders

33:13.792 --> 33:15.794
that cause a buildup
of ethylene glycol?

33:15.827 --> 33:17.796
Not off-hand,

33:17.829 --> 33:20.532
but if it's not in Harrison's,
it probably doesn't exist.

33:20.566 --> 33:23.169
I mean, there are hundreds
of rare ailments

33:23.202 --> 33:25.437
that fall under
glycogen storage diseases,

33:25.471 --> 33:27.406
amino acid disorders
of metabolism...

33:27.439 --> 33:29.575
You could try a MEDLINE
search for substances

33:29.608 --> 33:32.644
that would give you a false
positive for ethylene glycol.

33:32.678 --> 33:34.313
You might get lucky.

33:34.346 --> 33:36.515
You went, uh, pretty long
and hard on that guy earlier.

33:36.548 --> 33:38.784
Yeah, I figured it was
the least I could do.

33:38.817 --> 33:40.586
He was dying.

33:40.619 --> 33:42.354
If you need to take
a couple days...

33:42.388 --> 33:43.589
I'm not on
till Saturday.

33:43.622 --> 33:45.191
Good night.

33:51.197 --> 33:53.232
Okay, make
a three-centimeter incision

33:53.265 --> 33:55.767
in the fifth intercostal space,
mid-axillary line.

33:55.801 --> 33:57.436
What are you doing?
I am teaching.

33:57.469 --> 33:58.804
All right, all right,
harder, honey--

33:58.837 --> 34:00.539
you got to give it
all you got.
Stop.

34:00.572 --> 34:02.608
Aim for the ispilateral nipple
at a 45-degree angle

34:02.641 --> 34:03.775
while you keep aspirating.

34:03.809 --> 34:05.511
Somebody broke his ribs
doing CPR.

34:05.544 --> 34:07.813
Now he needs chest tubes
and volume for hypotension.

34:07.846 --> 34:09.447
It could have
bagged his spleen too.

34:09.481 --> 34:10.716
Then do an ultrasound.

34:10.748 --> 34:12.118
Look, you coded him
for 35 minutes, Carter.

34:12.150 --> 34:13.485
He's brain dead.

34:13.518 --> 34:14.686
He'll probably arrest
in the next four hours,

34:14.719 --> 34:16.422
and he's got no next of kin.

34:16.455 --> 34:18.324
We might as well get the maximum
student benefit out of him.

34:18.357 --> 34:20.126
You're in.
Unhook and run in 500 cc's.
No, I said stop.

34:20.126 --> 34:21.159
I'm about to cannulate...
Get out of here.

34:21.193 --> 34:22.494
Everybody, get out.
Hey.

34:22.527 --> 34:25.197
What the hell's the matter
with you?

34:25.231 --> 34:26.632
Look, you need to go home.

34:26.665 --> 34:28.634
You need to get the hell
out of here right now.

34:31.703 --> 34:34.139
( clattering )

35:15.581 --> 35:17.616
Hey.

35:19.651 --> 35:21.487
I didn't think you'd come.

35:21.520 --> 35:23.455
( sighs )

35:24.890 --> 35:27.559
I wasn't sure
you'd be here.

35:35.234 --> 35:36.535
What's going on?

35:36.568 --> 35:39.571
Oh, been traveling, uh,
you know...

35:39.605 --> 35:42.241
here, there...
visiting old friends,

35:42.274 --> 35:44.443
just, uh, trying to reconnect,

35:44.476 --> 35:47.613
and, uh...
keep in touch.

35:48.647 --> 35:50.416
Not with me.

35:50.449 --> 35:52.618
Not with Maggie.

35:58.390 --> 35:59.691
You know that guy?

35:59.725 --> 36:01.627
No, do you?

36:01.660 --> 36:04.563
Does he look familiar
to you?

36:04.596 --> 36:06.465
He's been looking at me
like he knows me.

36:09.668 --> 36:10.836
No.

36:10.869 --> 36:13.239
They all have been.

36:13.272 --> 36:14.540
I don't know.

36:14.573 --> 36:16.908
Did you notice that
when you walked in?

36:16.942 --> 36:19.278
This is a weird place,
isn't it?

36:19.311 --> 36:20.579
Yeah.

36:20.612 --> 36:22.348
I'm glad you came.

36:22.381 --> 36:23.749
I got turned around.

36:23.782 --> 36:25.251
I don't know
this area very well.

36:25.284 --> 36:26.652
This is a strange part
of the country.

36:26.685 --> 36:27.919
You about ready
to get out of here?

36:27.953 --> 36:30.956
I need to pay for my coffee.

36:30.989 --> 36:32.624
Okay.

36:35.294 --> 36:36.528
I don't have any money.

36:39.531 --> 36:41.333
Don't tell me
your HMO doesn't cover

36:41.367 --> 36:42.701
somebody to do that for you.

36:42.734 --> 36:43.935
Eh, you know
what they say--

36:43.969 --> 36:45.537
you want something
done right...

36:45.571 --> 36:46.905
Is that why you thought

36:46.938 --> 36:49.541
you could perform
a surgical procedure in the ER?

36:49.575 --> 36:51.643
It worked, didn't it?

36:51.677 --> 36:54.546
Well, she's on dopamine
and still febrile.

36:54.580 --> 36:55.847
The good news is,

36:55.881 --> 36:58.784
we haven't had
to intubate... yet.

36:58.817 --> 36:59.918
She could have died.

36:59.951 --> 37:02.754
I still haven't ruled
that out.

37:02.788 --> 37:04.456
It was a good call,
Robert.

37:04.490 --> 37:06.658
Unfortunately,
the drainage was incomplete.

37:06.692 --> 37:09.461
There were loculations
that you couldn't reach,

37:09.495 --> 37:11.863
which means I'll have to do
an open laparotomy.

37:11.897 --> 37:14.700
It's a damn shame
that you didn't catch
it the first time.

37:14.733 --> 37:16.535
Subphrenic abscess
is a surgical disease.

37:16.568 --> 37:17.936
They don't see it
much down here.

37:17.969 --> 37:20.672
Robert, I would have caught it
if you'd let me,

37:20.706 --> 37:23.642
and she'd be cooling down
on Zosyn before surgery.

37:23.675 --> 37:26.545
Now she's more of a mess
than if you'd done nothing.

37:27.646 --> 37:29.348
Did that hurt?

37:29.381 --> 37:31.650
Nah, but I wish it had.

37:33.719 --> 37:35.521
How long has it been
like this?

37:35.554 --> 37:37.556
A few days.

37:37.589 --> 37:39.691
More than a few, I'd guess.

37:39.725 --> 37:44.330
I'm going to pack the cavity
with Iodiform gauze.

37:44.330 --> 37:45.664
Is Gunn following this?

37:45.697 --> 37:48.634
Yeah, Gunn, plastics,
ortho, hand, and ID.

37:48.667 --> 37:51.337
Hyperbarics want me
to try them next.

37:51.370 --> 37:54.706
And what's after that--
witchcraft, magnets?

37:54.740 --> 37:57.709
( laughs ):
I'll try anything at this point.

37:59.044 --> 38:01.713
You know, at some point,
maybe...

38:08.354 --> 38:09.688
What?

38:09.721 --> 38:11.790
It's nothing.

38:11.823 --> 38:13.859
Say it.

38:18.464 --> 38:22.501
At the point when the wound
becomes life-threatening,

38:22.534 --> 38:24.570
because of gangrene or sepsis...

38:24.603 --> 38:27.573
it may be in the patient's
best interest

38:27.606 --> 38:30.642
to consider
a definitive surgical cure.

38:40.151 --> 38:42.954
We're not giving up.

38:42.988 --> 38:47.759
Tell Ante, to be strong,
he's going to be better soon.

38:47.793 --> 38:50.796
I promise.

38:50.829 --> 38:52.498
( sighs )

38:52.531 --> 38:53.965
Any luck?

38:53.999 --> 38:56.668
Every phone call leads
to another dead end.

38:56.702 --> 38:58.537
No one can
tell you anything.

38:59.971 --> 39:01.607
I can try talking
to Doctor Anspaugh.

39:01.640 --> 39:02.841
He may be able to help

39:02.874 --> 39:06.412
( sighs )

39:07.746 --> 39:08.747
What?

39:09.948 --> 39:11.750
You.

39:11.783 --> 39:13.419
Luka Kovac.

39:14.553 --> 39:17.623
ER doctor,
living in Chicago

39:17.656 --> 39:21.493
You've made quite a life
for yourself.

39:21.527 --> 39:23.662
It's along way
from that little room

39:23.695 --> 39:24.763
you shared with Stipe and Tomo.

39:24.796 --> 39:27.599
( laughs )

39:27.633 --> 39:31.437
You could barely
stand up in there.

39:31.470 --> 39:33.439
I know. I have scars from
hitting my head in that place.

39:33.439 --> 39:36.808
You don't go back much?

39:36.842 --> 39:38.744
You must be very busy.

39:38.777 --> 39:40.512
Not as busy as a surgeon.

39:42.648 --> 39:44.650
Everybody's busy in America.

39:44.683 --> 39:48.754
Life is busy here,
not like back home.

39:48.787 --> 39:51.590
You don't miss it?

39:51.623 --> 39:54.726
Sometimes I miss the ocean.

39:54.760 --> 39:56.562
The people...

39:56.595 --> 39:58.830
Driving up the coast
on a summer day.

39:58.864 --> 40:01.166
Do you remember that time

40:01.199 --> 40:04.536
we drove to Vukovar
after the finals?

40:04.570 --> 40:05.604
You hit that goat.

40:05.637 --> 40:06.772
( laughs )

40:06.805 --> 40:08.907
Oh, my God, that was horrible.

40:08.940 --> 40:10.742
It was hilarious.

40:10.776 --> 40:12.944
You and Tomo jumped out
and tried to revive him.

40:12.978 --> 40:18.650
I was doing CPR, but Stipe
refused to do mouth-to-mouth.

40:18.684 --> 40:21.753
And Tomo wanted
to put in a chest tube.

40:21.787 --> 40:22.821
( laughs )

40:22.854 --> 40:24.590
That poor goat.

40:24.623 --> 40:29.928
I think that was
the first patient you ever lost.

40:29.961 --> 40:35.601
( laughs )

40:35.634 --> 40:38.169
Hey, John, it's me.

40:38.203 --> 40:40.606
Um, I'm at a motel room
at the airport,

40:40.639 --> 40:42.741
because we missed our plane...

40:42.774 --> 40:44.976
and I'm sorry,

40:45.010 --> 40:48.647
but I'm trying to get us on
the first flight out tomorrow,

40:48.680 --> 40:50.248
and I'll try to call you later.

40:50.281 --> 40:52.551
Bye.

40:55.854 --> 40:58.056
Better?

40:58.089 --> 40:59.157
Better.

40:59.190 --> 41:00.559
Thanks for the clothes.

41:00.592 --> 41:03.695
You can thank Carter.
They're his.

41:06.765 --> 41:07.833
He also sent this.

41:07.866 --> 41:08.867
What is it?

41:08.900 --> 41:10.602
Depakote.

41:13.739 --> 41:15.273
This is my life
now, isn't it?

41:15.306 --> 41:17.543
It's up to you.

41:22.914 --> 41:24.850
We all thought you were dead,
you know.

41:24.883 --> 41:26.752
Except for Mom, of course.

41:26.785 --> 41:28.219
She refused to believe it.

41:28.253 --> 41:29.821
She know you
were coming?

41:29.855 --> 41:32.190
Couldn't get
in touch with her.

41:32.223 --> 41:33.892
For all I know,
she's missing, too.

41:33.925 --> 41:35.761
( laughs )

41:35.794 --> 41:37.295
It's not funny.

41:37.328 --> 41:39.765
I know.

41:39.798 --> 41:41.800
It's a little funny.

41:43.669 --> 41:45.837
So, what happens now?

41:45.871 --> 41:47.573
We go home.

41:48.807 --> 41:50.008
Well, what about me?

41:51.910 --> 41:54.746
I don't want
to live like this.

41:54.780 --> 41:57.315
Can't keep doing this to you...

41:57.348 --> 41:58.650
to me...

41:58.684 --> 42:00.786
You have to get into a program.

42:05.591 --> 42:06.792
Will you help me?

42:14.099 --> 42:16.267
Don't I always?

42:36.622 --> 42:38.857
Dr. Carter.

42:38.890 --> 42:40.859
It's okay.

42:42.127 --> 42:43.061
Where's your father?

42:43.094 --> 42:44.730
He took a later flight.

42:44.763 --> 42:46.965
He's going to be landing
in a couple hours.

42:46.998 --> 42:48.066
Did my mother call?

42:48.099 --> 42:49.134
No. I'm sorry.

42:49.167 --> 42:50.869
Dr. Emerson was here earlier.

42:50.902 --> 42:53.772
He said you can call him
at home tonight, if you'd like.

42:53.805 --> 42:57.275
And Mr. Garrit called
from the funeral home.

42:57.308 --> 42:59.745
He apologized for the delay.

42:59.778 --> 43:01.146
They didn't come yet?

43:01.179 --> 43:03.348
He should be here
any minute.

43:03.381 --> 43:05.050
Can I get you
something to eat?

43:05.083 --> 43:06.317
No, thank you.

43:06.351 --> 43:08.654
Tea, perhaps?
No, I'm fine, thanks.
