WEBVTT

00:02.336 --> 00:04.338
Tonight on
Kitchen Nightmares...

00:04.371 --> 00:06.907
Chef Ramsay heads
to Southern California

00:06.940 --> 00:09.910
where a Mexican restaurant
is heading south...

00:09.943 --> 00:11.178
The only thing
that's missing here...

00:11.211 --> 00:12.546
In a hurry.
...Is the drive-through.

00:12.579 --> 00:14.882
Is that bad?

00:14.915 --> 00:16.016
The owner, Laura,

00:16.049 --> 00:17.718
was a successful caterer
for years.

00:17.751 --> 00:19.720
I'm just adding a dining room.
How could it be so hard?

00:19.753 --> 00:22.356
But barely a year
into the restaurant, business...

00:22.389 --> 00:23.390
Perla.
Hates 'em.

00:23.423 --> 00:25.559
Nobody tasted
before we did this?

00:25.592 --> 00:27.294
She is failing miserably.

00:27.327 --> 00:28.996
This is not a restaurant.

00:29.029 --> 00:30.000
Her chef
is really a cook.

00:30.000 --> 00:30.097
Her chef
is really a cook.

00:30.130 --> 00:32.299
Perla's never gonna
step up--ever.

00:32.332 --> 00:33.834
Perla's family to me.

00:33.867 --> 00:35.035
The food is really mediocre.

00:35.068 --> 00:36.236
That's like eating
wet cardboard.

00:36.270 --> 00:37.671
Oh, God.

00:37.704 --> 00:39.172
Look at that!
This is unbelievable.

00:39.206 --> 00:41.141
My God.

00:41.174 --> 00:43.010
And the restaurant
is totally dysfunctional.

00:43.043 --> 00:44.778
Rapido, please.

00:46.013 --> 00:47.481
You are mad.

00:47.514 --> 00:48.815
I don't know
what the  I'm doing.

00:48.849 --> 00:50.851
Will this owner
be able to face the truth?

00:50.884 --> 00:53.253
Are you her boss?
I am her boss.

00:53.287 --> 00:54.721
Wrong!
You are her friend.

00:54.755 --> 00:56.757
And have the guts
to make the toughest decision...

00:56.790 --> 00:59.092
- I don't want to lose this.
- ...Of her life?

00:59.126 --> 01:00.000
I promise you
it will be okay.

01:00.000 --> 01:00.761
I promise you
it will be okay.

01:00.794 --> 01:03.230
Or will Laura
collapse under the pressure?

01:03.263 --> 01:04.364
What a disaster.

01:04.398 --> 01:05.632
It's hard, okay?

01:05.666 --> 01:07.334
I'm frightened
to all hell right now.

01:07.367 --> 01:09.603
This is one
Kitchen Nightmares...

01:09.636 --> 01:12.506
Your grandmother must be
turning over in her grave.

01:12.539 --> 01:13.907
Where Chef Ramsay
may have arrived...

01:13.941 --> 01:15.175
Bloody hell.

01:15.208 --> 01:16.743
Too late.

01:16.777 --> 01:19.146
Mama Rita,
Mamma Mia.

01:38.565 --> 01:39.499
Nestled in the hills

01:39.533 --> 01:41.969
45 miles north of Los Angeles

01:42.002 --> 01:44.338
is the idyllic town
of Newbury Park.

01:44.371 --> 01:45.906
This is where,
only a year ago,

01:45.939 --> 01:47.774
a single mom named Laura

01:47.808 --> 01:49.576
was hoping
to fulfill her dream

01:49.610 --> 01:53.580
by opening a restaurant
called Mama Rita's.

01:53.614 --> 01:54.715
My grandmother

01:54.748 --> 01:55.816
Was always cooking,

01:55.849 --> 01:57.284
and I was always being,
you know,

01:57.317 --> 01:58.585
brought in to help her cook.

01:58.619 --> 01:59.853
And I loved it.

01:59.886 --> 02:00.000
When she passed away,

02:00.000 --> 02:01.021
When she passed away,

02:01.054 --> 02:02.589
I said,
"I'm going to go for it.

02:02.623 --> 02:03.890
"I'm going
to open up a place

02:03.924 --> 02:05.425
and I'm gonna name it
after my grandmother."

02:05.459 --> 02:07.928
Welcome to Mama Rita's.

02:07.961 --> 02:09.696
When I started the business,

02:09.730 --> 02:12.599
it was purely a takeout,
catering business.

02:12.633 --> 02:14.801
We built
a really great reputation

02:14.835 --> 02:16.637
in a very short
period of time.

02:16.670 --> 02:18.472
And before I knew it,
I had customers that said,

02:18.505 --> 02:19.673
"You need a restaurant."

02:19.706 --> 02:21.808
And based on my reputation

02:21.842 --> 02:23.176
and the fact that
everybody wanted this,

02:23.210 --> 02:24.378
I went for it.

02:24.411 --> 02:26.613
All right, guys.
We're open for business.

02:26.647 --> 02:27.681
Now I'm just adding
a dining room,

02:27.714 --> 02:29.016
and I'm serving 200 people.

02:29.049 --> 02:30.000
I've served, you know,
1,000 people in a catering job.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.518
I've served, you know,
1,000 people in a catering job.

02:31.551 --> 02:32.853
How could it be so hard?

02:32.886 --> 02:34.621
Colorado's really tender.

02:34.655 --> 02:35.989
Yeah. Uh-huh.

02:36.023 --> 02:38.492
I cook for Mama Rita's
for six years.

02:41.461 --> 02:43.363
She's my right hand
and my savior.

02:43.397 --> 02:44.798
I mean,
she's family to me.

02:49.670 --> 02:52.472
Laura is not a good boss

02:52.506 --> 02:55.776
because there's not
a lot of rules enforced

02:55.809 --> 02:57.577
and--no one necessarily
knowing what they're doing.

02:57.611 --> 02:59.379
The direction I get

02:59.413 --> 03:00.000
from Laura
is a little hit-and-miss.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.249
from Laura
is a little hit-and-miss.

03:02.282 --> 03:04.117
And I don't really think
Laura knows

03:04.151 --> 03:05.786
how to run her restaurant.

03:05.819 --> 03:08.355
I need a cocktail now.

03:08.388 --> 03:09.656
Laura, as a restaurant owner,

03:09.690 --> 03:11.158
is inexperienced

03:11.191 --> 03:13.060
'cause she's never had
any training in this business.

03:13.093 --> 03:14.795
This is completely
brand-spanking-new to her.

03:14.828 --> 03:16.496
So was the catering business.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.231
But that was easier.
It was small.

03:18.265 --> 03:19.533
This is huge.

03:19.566 --> 03:21.835
I know, I know.

03:33.447 --> 03:34.548
During the first month,

03:34.581 --> 03:36.383
We were just packed.

03:36.416 --> 03:38.385
The public--they want
the best experience,

03:38.418 --> 03:40.153
the best service,
the best food.

03:40.187 --> 03:41.188
Sorry about that.

03:41.221 --> 03:42.456
Comp 'em out

03:42.489 --> 03:43.857
and send 'em
a free dessert, please.

03:43.890 --> 03:45.092
And I didn't deliver it.

03:45.125 --> 03:46.660
And I'm begging people,

03:46.693 --> 03:48.295
"Please come back
and give me another chance."

03:48.328 --> 03:50.030
And some say, "No, I'll never
go back there again."

03:50.063 --> 03:51.665
The debt
that I have accrued

03:51.698 --> 03:53.600
with this business
is astronomical.

03:53.633 --> 03:54.968
I'm on the foreclosure list,

03:55.001 --> 03:56.036
so there's a chance
I could lose the house.

03:57.738 --> 03:59.339
If I didn't believe in this,

03:59.372 --> 04:00.000
I wouldn't put my heart,
my soul,

04:00.000 --> 04:00.874
I wouldn't put my heart,
my soul,

04:00.907 --> 04:02.709
every single thing
I've got into this.

04:02.743 --> 04:04.511
I believe it can be saved--

04:04.544 --> 04:06.546
if I can fix what's wrong.

04:14.387 --> 04:16.022
Some of the best Mexican
restaurants in the world

04:16.056 --> 04:17.324
are not actually
from Mexico.

04:17.357 --> 04:18.792
They're here
in Southern California.

04:18.825 --> 04:20.927
Now, this restaurant here
has been open just 12 months.

04:20.961 --> 04:22.963
Sadly, it's only
months away from closing.

04:22.996 --> 04:24.531
There's gotta be something
seriously wrong.

04:24.564 --> 04:26.266
It looks beautiful.

04:26.299 --> 04:28.235
Wow.

04:28.268 --> 04:29.536
How are you?
I'm good, thank you.

04:29.569 --> 04:30.000
Pleasure to meet you.
Likewise.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.238
Pleasure to meet you.
Likewise.

04:31.271 --> 04:32.472
Now this is Mama...

04:32.506 --> 04:35.242
I am Maggie.
I'm the mother of the owner.

04:35.275 --> 04:36.710
I thought you
were Mama Rita.

04:36.743 --> 04:38.879
No, I am--
I'm Mama Rita's daughter.

04:38.912 --> 04:40.881
Mama Rita's daughter.
Where is Mama Rita?

04:40.914 --> 04:43.617
Mama Rita is, uh, buried in
the cemetery over the hill.

04:43.650 --> 04:46.086
Oh. I'm sorry
to hear that.

04:46.119 --> 04:48.221
Not a problem.
So Mama Rita's your mother.

04:48.255 --> 04:50.924
Yes.
And it's your daughter
that is...

04:50.957 --> 04:52.726
Laura.
Laura.

04:52.759 --> 04:53.827
I will take you
to Laura.
Excellent.

04:53.860 --> 04:55.262
Thank you, my darling.

04:55.295 --> 04:57.197
This would be
my daughter, Laura.

04:57.230 --> 04:58.965
Well, how are you?
Fine.

04:58.999 --> 05:00.000
Nice to meet you.
Good to see you.

05:00.000 --> 05:00.333
Nice to meet you.
Good to see you.

05:00.367 --> 05:02.002
Can I just say
this place looks stunning?

05:02.035 --> 05:03.937
Thank you.
My goodness, me.

05:03.970 --> 05:05.539
Somebody spent
a lot of money here.

05:05.572 --> 05:06.907
And you run the place?

05:06.940 --> 05:08.475
I run the place.
I try.

05:08.508 --> 05:09.743
This is very
different for me.

05:09.776 --> 05:11.178
Catering is--
was my specialty.

05:11.211 --> 05:12.646
That's what I did before
I opened the restaurant.

05:12.679 --> 05:14.815
Ah.
I did very well
at catering.

05:14.848 --> 05:16.016
Top dish.
What would you recommend?

05:16.049 --> 05:17.050
The homemade tamales.

05:17.083 --> 05:18.785
Oh, I love tamales.
Well, good to see you.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.821
Good to see you.
Time to eat.
I'm starving.

05:20.854 --> 05:22.956
Excellent.

05:22.989 --> 05:24.825
This is my table?
Thank you.

05:24.858 --> 05:26.726
Perla.

05:26.760 --> 05:27.994
Yes.

05:28.028 --> 05:29.796
When his order comes in,
we'll let you know.

05:29.830 --> 05:30.000
And you need to be the one
that cooks his food, okay?

05:30.000 --> 05:32.732
And you need to be the one
that cooks his food, okay?

05:37.370 --> 05:38.471
How are you, sir?
What's going on?

05:38.505 --> 05:39.739
I'm amazing.
How are you?

05:39.773 --> 05:40.874
And you are...?
Brad.

05:40.907 --> 05:42.042
Brad, good to see you.

05:42.075 --> 05:43.176
How long have you
been here?

05:43.210 --> 05:44.644
From the beginning.
From the beginning?

05:44.678 --> 05:46.112
Mm-hmm.

05:46.146 --> 05:47.914
I can't believe
how plush this place is.

05:47.948 --> 05:49.416
It's like, don't judge a book
by its cover,

05:49.449 --> 05:52.819
'cause you walk in here
and you see this gorgeous place.

05:52.853 --> 05:55.255
But Mama Rita's doesn't
live up to its expectations.

05:55.288 --> 05:56.790
If you can
navigate me around

05:56.823 --> 05:58.258
the stuff
to stay away from.

05:58.291 --> 06:00.000
Molotes...
Taquitos...

06:00.000 --> 06:01.561
Molotes...
Taquitos...

06:01.595 --> 06:05.198
Ooh.
Empanadas de pollo...

06:05.232 --> 06:06.233
Really?
Yeah.

06:06.266 --> 06:07.934
And why would
I stay away from that?

06:07.968 --> 06:11.371
Just because...I just
think they're really dry.

06:11.404 --> 06:13.139
Mm. I respect
your honesty.

06:13.173 --> 06:14.374
Thank you.
I'll bear that in mind.

06:14.407 --> 06:15.508
Yout got it.

06:15.542 --> 06:18.278
Holy crap.
That is really scary.

06:18.311 --> 06:19.813
Within the five minutes
I've been in the restaurant,

06:19.846 --> 06:21.615
I've been told
what to stay away from

06:21.648 --> 06:23.416
from the head waiter.

06:23.450 --> 06:24.751
Ay yi yi.

06:24.784 --> 06:26.019
Hot sauce.

06:26.052 --> 06:27.220
Thank you.

06:27.254 --> 06:28.989
Oh, hello.
This is Cheryl.

06:29.022 --> 06:30.000
This is, uh,
my manager.

06:30.000 --> 06:30.523
This is, uh,
my manager.

06:30.557 --> 06:32.959
And you manage the kitchen
and the front of house?

06:32.993 --> 06:34.361
Um, front of the house.
Oh.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.096
And caterer.
And I do catering as well.

06:36.129 --> 06:37.197
What's wrong
with the place?

06:37.230 --> 06:39.366
Lack of customers.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.034
So why have we got
a lack in customers?

06:41.067 --> 06:42.669
We need more customers.

06:42.702 --> 06:45.305
We need to figure out how
to get more people in here.

06:45.338 --> 06:46.606
Okay.

06:46.640 --> 06:47.774
Thank you.
And you're the manager.

06:47.807 --> 06:49.576
Yeah.
Oh, my God.

06:49.609 --> 06:50.777
A manager
that didn't even know

06:50.810 --> 06:53.513
what's wrong with
the restaurant is scary.

06:53.546 --> 06:55.782
Okay.
Look forward
to catching you up.

06:55.815 --> 06:57.350
Not with the manager.
Thank you.

06:58.952 --> 07:00.000
A manager that doesn't
know what's wrong.

07:00.000 --> 07:00.987
A manager that doesn't
know what's wrong.

07:01.021 --> 07:02.822
I don't know
what answer he wanted.

07:02.856 --> 07:03.924
I mean, what
was wrong with that?

07:03.957 --> 07:05.558
Lack of customers.
Really?

07:05.592 --> 07:08.028
That's a great insight,
isn't it?

07:08.061 --> 07:10.363
Right.
Here we go.

07:10.397 --> 07:11.998
Let's start off
with a tamale.

07:11.998 --> 07:13.165
Got it.
The chimichanga.

07:13.166 --> 07:14.734
Yeah.
Let's go for a burrito.

07:14.767 --> 07:16.236
I think that's
enough for now.

07:16.269 --> 07:17.837
All righty.
Thank you.

07:17.837 --> 07:19.071
Anybody taste anything?

07:19.104 --> 07:20.940
Perla,
everything was good?

07:20.973 --> 07:22.241
Yeah. Uh-huh.

07:22.274 --> 07:23.475
If Chef Ramsay

07:23.476 --> 07:24.644
Doesn't like
my grandmother's recipes,

07:24.677 --> 07:25.912
that concerns me.

07:25.945 --> 07:27.380
Anybody taste the tamales?

07:28.481 --> 07:30.000
See what he thinks.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.451
See what he thinks.

07:31.484 --> 07:32.952
Tamale.
Extremely hot.

07:32.986 --> 07:36.690
All right.

07:36.723 --> 07:39.092
Oh, no. God, I hope
the tamales were moist.

07:40.527 --> 07:43.229
It's like
soaking wet newspaper.

07:46.366 --> 07:47.400
Sheesh.

07:47.434 --> 07:49.469
That is so dry.

07:49.502 --> 07:50.870
Just a second.

07:50.904 --> 07:53.406
My goodness, me.

07:53.440 --> 07:54.741
That's a fresh tamale?

07:54.774 --> 07:56.009
Well, when we make them,

07:56.042 --> 07:57.343
we make them
in big batches

07:57.377 --> 07:59.079
and then they're steamed
and then they're served.

07:59.112 --> 08:00.000
Because we make such
large volumes at a time...

08:00.000 --> 08:01.014
Because we make such
large volumes at a time...

08:01.047 --> 08:03.249
So you're sounding like
the catering company now.

08:03.283 --> 08:05.018
Yes.
And they
go out like that?

08:05.051 --> 08:08.021
It's--they should be wet
enough with the sauce inside

08:08.054 --> 08:10.056
that when you re-steam
them, they stay moist.

08:10.090 --> 08:11.157
What an embarrassment.

08:11.191 --> 08:12.559
And this is your chef

08:12.592 --> 08:13.827
that ran
a catering business.

08:13.860 --> 08:15.995
Correct.

08:16.029 --> 08:17.464
. Okay.
Okay.

08:20.467 --> 08:22.235
Hates the tamales.

08:22.268 --> 08:24.871
Really?
Perla.

08:24.904 --> 08:26.439
Hates 'em.

08:26.473 --> 08:28.708
Said it's so dry
it's inedible.

08:28.742 --> 08:30.000
He said
it's embarrassing.

08:30.000 --> 08:30.276
He said
it's embarrassing.

08:30.310 --> 08:32.746
Yeah, really dry.

08:32.779 --> 08:33.847
Are you cooking
everything?

08:33.880 --> 08:35.215
Yeah.

08:35.248 --> 08:37.016
Perla, are you
cooking the chimis?

08:37.050 --> 08:38.318
Uh-huh.

08:46.292 --> 08:47.894
Your chicken chimichangas.

08:47.927 --> 08:50.563
Ooh!

08:50.597 --> 08:52.866
Chimi, chimi, chimi,
chimichanga.

08:58.604 --> 09:00.000
It's dry.

09:00.000 --> 09:00.472
It's dry.

09:00.506 --> 09:02.408
It's shards of dry chicken.

09:02.441 --> 09:04.510
God, now what?

09:07.012 --> 09:08.847
Here's the thing--

09:08.881 --> 09:10.015
honestly,

09:10.049 --> 09:11.550
chimichanga...

09:11.583 --> 09:13.852
Chimi chuck it
in the bin.

09:13.886 --> 09:15.554
What a shame.

09:16.755 --> 09:18.724
Perla.

09:18.757 --> 09:20.826
He hates the chimis.
He didn't like 'em.

09:23.562 --> 09:24.963
Not to him,
apparently.

09:24.997 --> 09:26.699
I'm frustrated
at my kitchen.

09:26.732 --> 09:28.133
It's a bit
of a punch to the gut

09:28.167 --> 09:29.501
about my food.

09:29.535 --> 09:30.000
Steak burrito.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.336
Steak burrito.

09:34.106 --> 09:35.407
Look at that.

09:37.109 --> 09:38.444
That is gross.

09:38.477 --> 09:40.212
Has to be the biggest
ad for any diaper

09:40.245 --> 09:41.480
anywhere in California.

09:41.513 --> 09:43.982
Oh, no.

09:46.485 --> 09:48.454
Oh, God.

09:48.487 --> 09:49.688
My God.

09:51.356 --> 09:53.392
That's like
eating wet cardboard.

09:53.425 --> 09:54.593
Have a taste of that.
Please.

09:58.297 --> 10:00.000
Bloody hell.

10:00.000 --> 10:00.165
Bloody hell.

10:00.199 --> 10:01.400
The steak was gamey.

10:01.433 --> 10:03.035
It was kind of like
a car wash.

10:03.068 --> 10:04.269
Moist and mushy.

10:04.303 --> 10:06.071
Oh, my God.

10:06.105 --> 10:08.373
That is disgusting.

10:08.374 --> 10:10.342
Let me taste the steak.

10:10.343 --> 10:12.245
He says the steak
tastes like.

10:12.278 --> 10:14.480
Did you grill him
fresh steak for his burrito?

10:14.480 --> 10:15.948
Yeah.
You didn't pull it
from here, right?

10:18.817 --> 10:20.653
Didn't we taste everything
before we put it out?

10:20.686 --> 10:22.121
Yes.

10:22.154 --> 10:25.257
Ugh.

10:25.290 --> 10:27.860
It's really salty.

10:27.893 --> 10:29.962
Nobody tasted
before we did this?

10:37.002 --> 10:38.771
Damn it.

10:38.804 --> 10:40.639
When you have somebody
come in

10:40.673 --> 10:42.708
that rips apart
all of your food

10:42.741 --> 10:44.710
that--that I was proud of,

10:44.743 --> 10:45.978
it hurts a little bit.

10:46.011 --> 10:47.746
Grandma, I'm so sorry.

10:47.780 --> 10:48.981
I hate to slag you off,

10:49.014 --> 10:52.217
however, I just
want something fresh.

10:52.251 --> 10:55.187
After a lunch
of disgusting dishes,

10:55.220 --> 10:57.056
Chef Ramsay
has quickly realized

10:57.089 --> 10:58.657
why this beautiful restaurant

10:58.691 --> 11:00.000
is in an ugly situation.

11:00.000 --> 11:00.693
is in an ugly situation.

11:00.726 --> 11:01.894
Come round, please.

11:01.927 --> 11:03.462
Thank you.

11:03.495 --> 11:05.964
So...this is...

11:05.998 --> 11:07.099
Perla.
Perla.

11:07.132 --> 11:10.035
Sadly, the food was dry.

11:10.036 --> 11:12.538
It's like eating
processed food.

11:12.571 --> 11:15.508
Is the food today
the same that you serve

11:15.541 --> 11:17.677
when you have
a catering event?

11:17.710 --> 11:19.645
Yeah.

11:19.679 --> 11:21.347
You'd be serving that crap?

11:21.380 --> 11:22.748
Why don't you
do it properly?

11:22.782 --> 11:24.517
Because everybody
loved my catering.

11:24.550 --> 11:26.585
It's completely
two different monsters.

11:26.619 --> 11:27.720
It's not gonna work.

11:27.753 --> 11:29.088
Coming out
of a catering business,

11:29.121 --> 11:30.000
trying to run a restaurant
that cost how much?

11:30.000 --> 11:32.391
trying to run a restaurant
that cost how much?

11:32.425 --> 11:34.260
1.5.

11:34.293 --> 11:36.629
$1.5 million?

11:36.662 --> 11:37.897
Yes.

11:37.930 --> 11:39.832
Oh, my God.

11:39.865 --> 11:41.467
And I'm $350,000
in the hole right now

11:41.500 --> 11:42.968
on top of that.

11:43.002 --> 11:46.405
So you're in
for just under $2 million.

11:46.439 --> 11:47.807
God bless your grandmother,

11:47.840 --> 11:49.842
but she must be
turning over in her grave.

11:52.044 --> 11:53.245
Coming up...

11:53.279 --> 11:55.347
Can Chef Ramsay
turn this caterer...

11:55.381 --> 11:56.482
I'm shocked.

11:56.515 --> 11:57.550
Into a restaurateur?

11:57.583 --> 11:58.851
This is not a restaurant.

11:58.884 --> 12:00.000
I'm scared...right now.

12:00.000 --> 12:00.186
I'm scared...right now.

12:00.219 --> 12:01.787
Or will Laura's bad habits...

12:01.821 --> 12:03.656
Oh, my God.
Look at that!

12:03.689 --> 12:05.124
Continue to get in the way?

12:05.157 --> 12:06.726
You...are...mad.

12:06.759 --> 12:07.727
And later...

12:07.760 --> 12:09.528
This is the fight
of my life.

12:09.529 --> 12:11.130
Laura is in for
a gut-wrenching decision.

12:11.163 --> 12:12.465
Are you her boss
or are you her friend?

12:12.498 --> 12:13.900
I am her boss.
Wrong!

12:13.933 --> 12:15.434
Choosing between
keeping her friendship...

12:15.434 --> 12:17.369
I'm scared,
and it's hard, okay?

12:17.402 --> 12:19.505
And keeping her restaurant.

12:19.538 --> 12:21.940
I have to figure out
a way to save it.

12:34.238 --> 12:35.840
After a miserable lunch...

12:35.873 --> 12:36.941
That is disgusting.

12:36.974 --> 12:38.543
An alarming post-mortem...

12:38.576 --> 12:41.512
You're in for just under
$2 million?

12:41.546 --> 12:44.182
Chef Ramsay decides he wants
a better understanding

12:44.215 --> 12:45.983
of how this team of people
work together

12:46.017 --> 12:47.552
in a dinner service.

12:47.585 --> 12:49.587
Hello.
Hello.

12:49.620 --> 12:51.489
Tonight, I'm nervous
that Chef Ramsay may not think

12:51.522 --> 12:53.424
that the restaurant
is running efficiently.

12:53.458 --> 12:55.793
I really hope that the staff
hold it together,

12:55.827 --> 12:56.446
and that they shine.

12:56.446 --> 12:57.228
and that they shine.

12:57.261 --> 12:58.463
What can I get you two?

12:58.496 --> 13:00.398
Ceviche, please.
Ceviche Mama Rita.

13:00.431 --> 13:01.399
You got it.

13:01.432 --> 13:02.467
And for you, sir?

13:02.500 --> 13:03.968
I'll take the chicken.
All right.

13:04.001 --> 13:05.236
I'll put that
in for you guys.

13:05.269 --> 13:07.104
Thank you.

13:07.138 --> 13:08.673
I would say
that the ticket times

13:08.706 --> 13:11.008
are not even five minutes
for entrees.

13:15.913 --> 13:17.515
I cook really fast.

13:17.548 --> 13:19.283
Hey, food!

13:28.759 --> 13:30.228
They're normally
coming out this fast?

13:30.261 --> 13:31.462
Oh, yeah.
Yeah?

13:32.563 --> 13:34.365
Here we go.
Arroz con mariscos.

13:34.398 --> 13:36.200
Chili relleno.
There we go.

13:36.234 --> 13:37.201
Chicken tacos.

13:37.235 --> 13:38.302
I'm not done
with my soup.

13:38.336 --> 13:39.804
Send out fajitas.

13:39.837 --> 13:40.838
It's quicker than
a drive-thru, isn't it?

13:40.872 --> 13:41.839
Pretty much.

13:41.873 --> 13:42.974
Whew.

13:43.007 --> 13:44.675
Here you go.

13:44.709 --> 13:46.177
With food flying
out of the kitchen

13:46.210 --> 13:48.479
At an incredible pace...
Three minutes?

13:48.513 --> 13:51.849
The kitchen staff now
has time to socialize.

13:58.923 --> 14:01.392
Have you cleared the board?
All the tickets gone?

14:01.425 --> 14:02.493
Yes.
Wow.

14:02.527 --> 14:03.494
So just standing here

14:03.528 --> 14:04.695
for the next
couple of minutes,

14:04.729 --> 14:05.997
I can't believe how fast
the food comes out.

14:06.030 --> 14:07.498
It's like a conveyor belt.
Is that bad?

14:07.532 --> 14:09.867
It depends on quality.
Okay.

14:09.901 --> 14:12.470
While the customers may
appreciate the fast service...

14:12.503 --> 14:13.871
Here comes my shrimp!

14:13.905 --> 14:15.606
They are not
appreciating the food.

14:16.974 --> 14:18.609
Dry?

14:20.278 --> 14:21.546
No, I know, obviously.

14:21.579 --> 14:23.014
Stop, stop, stop.

14:23.047 --> 14:24.815
The only thing
that's missing here

14:24.849 --> 14:26.446
is a drive-thru.

14:26.446 --> 14:26.551
is a drive-thru.

14:26.584 --> 14:28.152
I'm pissed.

14:28.185 --> 14:29.554
He's telling me
that all my food is.

14:29.587 --> 14:30.855
So it's very frustrating

14:30.888 --> 14:32.523
when I don't know how
to do it another way.

14:32.557 --> 14:33.858
'Cause this is
all that I know.

14:35.560 --> 14:37.161
That is unbelievable.

14:37.194 --> 14:38.963
This has to be
the fastest-serving restaurant

14:38.996 --> 14:40.097
in America tonight,

14:40.131 --> 14:41.365
but it's not really
a restaurant.

14:41.399 --> 14:43.100
It's a fast food factory.

14:43.134 --> 14:44.435
What a joke.

14:47.204 --> 14:50.207
On the heels of a ridiculously
fast dinner service...

14:50.241 --> 14:52.043
Bye-bye.

14:52.076 --> 14:54.145
Chef Ramsay suspects
that shortcuts

14:54.178 --> 14:55.179
are being taken
in the kitchen.

14:55.212 --> 14:56.446
Wow...fast, huh?

14:56.446 --> 14:56.948
Wow...fast, huh?

14:56.981 --> 15:00.618
So it's time
for a little investigation.

15:03.688 --> 15:04.689
What are those?

15:05.856 --> 15:07.758
Oh, they're tamales.
Yeah.

15:07.792 --> 15:09.260
They're--they're frozen.

15:09.293 --> 15:10.361
Ah.

15:11.462 --> 15:13.230
So these are
your chimichangas.

15:13.264 --> 15:14.465
Are they frozen
as well?

15:15.833 --> 15:17.668
Wow.
When was all this made?

15:19.269 --> 15:21.705
Oh, my God.

15:21.738 --> 15:23.206
Can you
get me Laura, please?

15:23.240 --> 15:25.475
Yes, yes?
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here!

15:25.509 --> 15:26.446
What?
Come round, come round.

15:26.446 --> 15:26.676
What?
Come round, come round.

15:26.710 --> 15:28.445
Don't run,
not in a kitchen.

15:28.478 --> 15:29.679
Here's the thing.

15:29.713 --> 15:31.748
You're serving chicken
that was cooked

15:31.781 --> 15:33.583
nearly two months ago--

15:33.617 --> 15:34.718
defrosting it,
and then reheating it.

15:34.751 --> 15:36.820
And you're wondering
why it's dry?

15:36.853 --> 15:38.121
Were you aware of this or...

15:38.154 --> 15:39.422
This is what
we did for catering.

15:39.456 --> 15:40.557
Unbelievable.

15:40.590 --> 15:43.460
That may be why
the place is struggling.

15:44.494 --> 15:46.329
Where are the freezers?

15:46.363 --> 15:47.497
Freezer's there.

15:49.132 --> 15:50.901
Oh, my God.

15:52.469 --> 15:54.004
More tortillas.

15:54.037 --> 15:55.772
I hope everything's
right in there,

15:55.805 --> 15:56.446
the shelving
and all the food.

15:56.446 --> 15:57.574
the shelving
and all the food.

15:57.607 --> 16:00.110
Ugh. My God.

16:01.711 --> 16:02.879
You're joking, aren't you?

16:02.913 --> 16:04.614
Look at all
this stuff here.

16:06.049 --> 16:08.518
Bloody hell.
This is unbelievable.

16:08.552 --> 16:10.554
Look at that!

16:10.587 --> 16:12.556
This is what
we did for catering.

16:12.589 --> 16:14.090
You must have
hundreds of portions

16:14.124 --> 16:15.458
of stock here.

16:15.492 --> 16:17.894
He just kept grabbing
and grabbing

16:17.928 --> 16:19.563
And stacking my arms
with it.

16:19.596 --> 16:23.099
All this pre-cooked,
pre-rolled,

16:23.133 --> 16:25.435
frozen, then defrosted,

16:25.468 --> 16:26.446
is just absolutely appalling.

16:26.446 --> 16:27.437
is just absolutely appalling.

16:27.470 --> 16:29.673
This is not a restaurant.

16:29.706 --> 16:32.542
You...are...mad.

16:32.576 --> 16:34.010
I'm gonna wash my hands.

16:34.044 --> 16:35.745
They're stinky.

16:37.047 --> 16:39.516
I have a man back there
ripping everything apart,

16:39.549 --> 16:40.884
telling me I don't know
what the  I'm doing.

16:40.917 --> 16:42.719
When somebody takes
something that you have

16:42.752 --> 16:44.354
and butchers it,

16:44.387 --> 16:45.956
it hurts.

16:55.290 --> 16:57.592
A shocking discovery
at dinner service...

16:57.592 --> 16:58.926
Look at that!

16:58.927 --> 17:02.030
You must have hundreds
of portions of stock.

17:02.063 --> 17:04.499
Confirms to Chef Ramsay
that problems at this restaurant

17:04.532 --> 17:06.868
are bigger
than he anticipated.

17:06.901 --> 17:08.403
What a day.

17:08.436 --> 17:10.972
Lunch was disappointing.

17:11.005 --> 17:14.075
Dinner was shocking.

17:15.944 --> 17:18.413
It started off
with defrost and serve,

17:18.446 --> 17:20.115
followed by
defrost and serve,

17:20.148 --> 17:21.410
followed by...
defrost and serve.

17:21.410 --> 17:22.650
followed by...
defrost and serve.

17:22.684 --> 17:24.185
You're running a factory.

17:24.219 --> 17:25.186
Boom, boom.

17:25.220 --> 17:27.655
It's mass produced.

17:27.689 --> 17:28.890
Treating food
like a processing plant.

17:28.923 --> 17:31.259
Perla, is that quality,
what you cook?

17:31.292 --> 17:32.560
No.

17:32.594 --> 17:34.529
Did you honestly
think that serving

17:34.562 --> 17:37.599
defrosted food,
slopped out,

17:37.632 --> 17:39.234
was gonna
make you a success.

17:39.267 --> 17:41.503
I did well
at catering with it.

17:41.536 --> 17:44.239
You have driven away
more customers

17:44.272 --> 17:45.774
than you could ever imagine.

17:47.776 --> 17:49.878
Could I have
a word with Laura?

17:49.911 --> 17:51.410
Thank you.
Sit down.

17:51.410 --> 17:51.479
Thank you.
Sit down.

17:51.513 --> 17:54.849
I, um...

17:54.883 --> 17:55.850
I'm worried.

17:55.884 --> 17:56.985
I don't get

17:57.018 --> 17:58.987
your level of commitment
to make this place work.

18:00.455 --> 18:03.491
I-I never pretended to know
how to run a restaurant.

18:03.525 --> 18:05.593
You're smart.

18:05.627 --> 18:06.895
But you're
not being smart.

18:06.928 --> 18:08.596
Apparently not.

18:08.630 --> 18:10.698
This food is sinking you

18:10.732 --> 18:12.801
faster than you
know it.

18:12.834 --> 18:14.502
I don't want to lose this.

18:14.536 --> 18:15.537
I want to figure out

18:15.570 --> 18:16.938
A way to fix it
and make it great.

18:16.971 --> 18:20.375
But you really have to start
taking responsibility

18:20.408 --> 18:21.410
for what you're doing.

18:21.410 --> 18:22.177
for what you're doing.

18:22.210 --> 18:24.913
The difference in running
a catering outlet

18:24.946 --> 18:26.548
to running
a wonderful restaurant

18:26.581 --> 18:28.149
is night and day.

18:28.183 --> 18:31.352
And the quicker
you get that through your head

18:31.386 --> 18:35.390
will be the start
of the change.

18:35.423 --> 18:36.591
Okay.

18:36.624 --> 18:37.959
I'm really sorry.

18:37.992 --> 18:40.562
I am too.

18:41.729 --> 18:43.398
I had gone for something

18:43.431 --> 18:46.234
that I maybe
shouldn't have gone for.

18:47.869 --> 18:50.472
And now I'm here...

18:50.505 --> 18:51.410
And I have to figure out
a way to save it

18:51.410 --> 18:53.074
And I have to figure out
a way to save it

18:53.107 --> 18:56.077
and fix it.

18:56.110 --> 18:58.480
I'm scared.
Very scared.

19:02.217 --> 19:03.384
Good God.

19:17.832 --> 19:20.869
Thinking about
what happened last night,

19:20.902 --> 19:21.410
Laura, she's not stupid.

19:21.410 --> 19:23.371
Laura, she's not stupid.

19:23.404 --> 19:24.906
She's more scared,
almost petrified.

19:24.939 --> 19:25.974
So in order for me
to help her

19:26.007 --> 19:27.542
to get over
that fear of change,

19:27.575 --> 19:29.444
I'm gonna take
the first step for her.

19:32.046 --> 19:34.682
And there's only one way
of doing this.

19:36.784 --> 19:39.053
Good-bye, frozen.

19:39.087 --> 19:40.555
Look at that!

19:41.723 --> 19:44.125
God, look
at the state of that.

19:44.158 --> 19:46.094
A year old..

19:46.127 --> 19:49.764
There's enough chimichangas here
to last me a lifetime.

19:49.797 --> 19:51.410
Good-bye, catering...

19:51.410 --> 19:51.533
Good-bye, catering...

19:53.434 --> 19:55.470
Hello, restaurant.

19:57.005 --> 20:00.008
Chef Ramsay has found
over $12,000 worth

20:00.041 --> 20:01.943
Of frozen food
in the freezer.

20:01.976 --> 20:03.177
Perla, Laura, good morning.
How are you both?

20:03.211 --> 20:04.679
Fine, thank you.

20:04.712 --> 20:05.980
Now it's time
to confront the owner

20:06.014 --> 20:07.715
And the chef
with his findings.

20:07.749 --> 20:09.450
Today's about change.
Yes.

20:09.484 --> 20:11.519
Go and have a quick look
round the kitchen.

20:11.553 --> 20:12.554
You'll see some adjustments.

20:14.888 --> 20:16.223
So far, it all looks the same.

20:23.097 --> 20:25.933
I was shocked.
Everything was gone.

20:25.967 --> 20:27.268
My freezer was empty.

20:27.302 --> 20:28.903
My walk-in refrigerator
was empty.

20:28.936 --> 20:31.306
I had no idea
what was happening.

20:31.339 --> 20:32.974
Oh, my God.

20:33.006 --> 20:35.642
To show the enormity
of the amount of frozen food...

20:35.643 --> 20:37.244
Ohh...

20:37.245 --> 20:39.447
Gordon has not only
removed it from the freezer,

20:39.480 --> 20:42.149
but has left it on display
in the restaurant.

20:42.183 --> 20:44.585
I was completely floored.

20:44.619 --> 20:47.722
I had just this sinking feeling
in my stomach.

20:49.023 --> 20:50.258
Look at this.

20:52.293 --> 20:53.794
What's going on there?

20:53.828 --> 20:55.596
Ugh.
They've gone green.

20:57.031 --> 20:58.833
Look, he's got
his Mexican sombrero on.

20:58.866 --> 21:00.735
Right!

21:00.768 --> 21:03.170
Chimichangas,
five dozen, ten dozen,

21:03.204 --> 21:04.272
twelve dozen.

21:04.305 --> 21:05.339
Ouch.

21:05.373 --> 21:08.676
And this isn't

21:08.709 --> 21:09.944
a catering business.

21:11.479 --> 21:12.747
I didn't know

21:12.780 --> 21:14.248
it was this bad
last night.

21:14.282 --> 21:17.285
Here's what concerns me
more than anything.

21:17.318 --> 21:18.919
These are from last year.

21:18.953 --> 21:21.410
August...And July.

21:21.410 --> 21:21.622
August...And July.

21:21.656 --> 21:23.090
Last year?

21:26.294 --> 21:28.696
What the
is going on?

21:28.729 --> 21:29.697
I'm shocked.

21:29.730 --> 21:32.099
I can see why.

21:32.133 --> 21:34.302
Have a good look.
I'm gonna wash my hands.

21:34.335 --> 21:35.936
Stinks.

21:35.970 --> 21:38.339
I guess I should be
on Perla more

21:38.372 --> 21:40.207
to make sure that
the structure is there

21:40.241 --> 21:41.442
and that things
are being handled

21:41.475 --> 21:42.476
the way that they should.

21:42.510 --> 21:44.412
But then again,
I own the restaurant,

21:44.445 --> 21:47.481
so everything comes back
to be my responsibility.

21:47.515 --> 21:49.617
This has made me feel
quite ignorant.

21:54.088 --> 21:55.289
Next...

21:55.323 --> 21:57.024
This is my last chance.

21:57.058 --> 21:58.759
I have put it all on the line
for this.

21:58.793 --> 22:00.027
Laura makes an attempt

22:00.061 --> 22:01.162
to turn around Mama Rita's.

22:01.195 --> 22:02.163
Perla,

22:02.196 --> 22:03.197
you gotta cook
the steak.

22:03.230 --> 22:04.298
It is raw.

22:04.332 --> 22:05.299
Oh, it's a disaster.

22:05.333 --> 22:06.634
Rapido,please.

22:06.667 --> 22:08.002
But she may have to do it...

22:08.035 --> 22:09.136
Give me an apron.

22:09.170 --> 22:10.604
All alone.

22:10.638 --> 22:11.872
We got to be able
to do it.

22:11.906 --> 22:12.907
And later...

22:12.940 --> 22:14.375
No one's
ever gonna take advantage

22:14.408 --> 22:16.110
- of me again.
- a confrontation...

22:16.143 --> 22:17.678
Are you her boss?
I am her boss.

22:17.712 --> 22:18.946
Wrong.
You're her friend.

22:18.979 --> 22:20.181
That puts Laura and Perla's

22:20.214 --> 22:21.182
estranged friendship...

22:21.215 --> 22:21.410
It's hard,
okay?

22:21.410 --> 22:22.650
It's hard,
okay?

22:22.683 --> 22:23.884
On the line.

22:23.884 --> 22:25.519
Love you.

22:25.552 --> 22:27.554
I promise you
it'll be okay.

22:27.587 --> 22:28.789
You don't want to miss

22:28.822 --> 22:31.358
What's coming up
on Kitchen Nightmares.

22:31.391 --> 22:32.793
Please don't cry.

22:41.635 --> 22:43.937
Today, Chef Ramsay
is hitting the streets,

22:43.970 --> 22:44.971
trying to gather
former customers

22:45.005 --> 22:47.708
of this young restaurant.

22:47.741 --> 22:50.210
He's hoping that they'll hammer
home to Laura

22:50.243 --> 22:53.547
what this community expects
from Mama Rita's.

22:53.580 --> 22:55.816
Nice.

22:59.653 --> 23:00.654
What is this?

23:00.687 --> 23:02.656
Who are all these people?

23:02.689 --> 23:03.890
Chef Ramsay knows that often

23:03.924 --> 23:05.421
the best way to get
his point across

23:05.421 --> 23:05.592
the best way to get
his point across

23:05.625 --> 23:07.694
is through the voices
of others.

23:07.728 --> 23:10.664
Ladies and gentlemen,
first of all, good afternoon.

23:10.697 --> 23:13.266
I was pretty shocked to see
all these people showed up.

23:13.300 --> 23:14.868
I really didn't know
what to expect.

23:14.901 --> 23:16.002
Thank you so much
for coming.

23:16.036 --> 23:17.104
It means a lot for you guys

23:17.137 --> 23:18.572
to make an effort to be here.

23:18.605 --> 23:20.407
These are ex-customers

23:20.440 --> 23:22.275
that were here
at the beginning

23:22.309 --> 23:23.610
to support this restaurant.

23:23.643 --> 23:24.611
It's important

23:24.644 --> 23:26.513
that we understand

23:26.546 --> 23:27.981
what went wrong

23:28.014 --> 23:30.283
when we had the chance to open
this restaurant.

23:30.317 --> 23:32.819
Please, find out
what happened.

23:32.853 --> 23:34.087
I'd like to start.

23:34.121 --> 23:35.155
Okay.

23:35.188 --> 23:35.421
Over the time, we felt

23:35.421 --> 23:36.490
Over the time, we felt

23:36.523 --> 23:38.992
we weren't getting
the service that we wanted.

23:39.025 --> 23:40.694
And the creativity of the food
was really lacking.

23:42.129 --> 23:43.130
On two different trips,

23:43.163 --> 23:44.731
I got sick

23:44.765 --> 23:45.766
within like a two-month period.

23:45.799 --> 23:47.334
And then I came here
two months later,

23:47.367 --> 23:48.635
I got sick again.

23:48.668 --> 23:51.938
And I kind of stayed away.

23:55.475 --> 23:56.977
Ouch.

23:57.010 --> 23:58.879
I guess I underestimated
the palate

23:58.912 --> 24:00.347
of the common person.

24:00.380 --> 24:02.349
Some of the items
we freeze,

24:02.382 --> 24:03.884
and as we've been going through,

24:03.917 --> 24:05.419
we're thinking that
that's probably what it is,

24:05.452 --> 24:07.053
and we're not gonna freeze
anymore.

24:07.087 --> 24:09.556
So hopefully that will take care
of that issue.

24:09.589 --> 24:10.624
And that's what we're changing.

24:10.657 --> 24:11.658
Thank you for being
so honest.

24:11.691 --> 24:12.659
I can vouch for Laura.

24:12.692 --> 24:13.960
Frozen has gone.

24:13.994 --> 24:15.529
Yes?

24:15.562 --> 24:17.631
I can't wait
to see you again.

24:17.664 --> 24:19.199
But next time it's going
to be inside the restaurant

24:19.232 --> 24:20.200
rather than outside.

24:20.233 --> 24:21.201
Thank you so much.

24:21.234 --> 24:22.903
Right, we got work to do.

24:23.904 --> 24:25.005
That's an eye-opener.

24:25.038 --> 24:26.640
Today, speaking
to all those people,

24:26.673 --> 24:29.109
I realized
people know good food.

24:29.142 --> 24:30.343
I respect that,

24:30.377 --> 24:31.578
and that's what I want
to give them.

24:36.216 --> 24:37.484
To make the transition

24:37.517 --> 24:39.386
from cooking frozen to fresh,

24:39.419 --> 24:42.189
Chef Ramsay has
just the challenge in mind

24:42.222 --> 24:44.491
to inspire Laura
and her Chef Perla.

24:44.524 --> 24:46.293
Chicken, shrimp,

24:46.326 --> 24:47.427
I've got steak here.

24:47.461 --> 24:48.428
30 minutes.

24:48.462 --> 24:49.529
We have a bit
of a cook-off now.

24:49.563 --> 24:51.164
Choose between the shrimp
or the chicken.

24:51.198 --> 24:52.232
And cook something

24:52.265 --> 24:53.333
really delicious.

24:53.366 --> 24:54.367
One minute gone.

24:54.401 --> 24:56.770
Let's go.

24:59.105 --> 25:01.341
It felt good working
with fresh ingredients.

25:01.374 --> 25:03.543
It was fun
to just grab something

25:03.577 --> 25:04.845
and just throw it all together

25:04.878 --> 25:05.421
and come up
with something good.

25:05.421 --> 25:06.480
and come up
with something good.

25:06.513 --> 25:08.915
Let me think,
let me think.

25:08.949 --> 25:10.350
What's the matter?

25:10.383 --> 25:12.452
I'm thinking.
You're thinking?

25:12.486 --> 25:14.988
I'm really nervous

25:15.021 --> 25:16.823
because I no have idea

25:16.857 --> 25:18.325
for what I cook.

25:18.358 --> 25:19.326
15 minutes left.

25:19.359 --> 25:21.161
Ay-yi-yi.

25:21.194 --> 25:22.596
Perla, get moving.

25:22.629 --> 25:24.731
I was nervous
about what she was making.

25:24.764 --> 25:25.866
No pressure, Perla.

25:25.899 --> 25:28.201
The creativity
seems not to be present.

25:28.235 --> 25:29.369
Five minutes,
be ready to plate, yeah?

25:29.402 --> 25:30.770
Yep.

25:32.172 --> 25:33.440
Ready?
Let's go.

25:33.473 --> 25:34.774
All right,
let's go.

25:36.276 --> 25:38.678
Chef Ramsay not only wants
the staff

25:38.712 --> 25:40.981
to taste the difference
between frozen and fresh...

25:41.014 --> 25:43.350
Not a single item
on the plate defrosted anywhere.

25:43.383 --> 25:45.185
He's also looking for the staff
to choose

25:45.218 --> 25:47.988
Which of the three dishes
goes on tonight's menu.

25:48.021 --> 25:49.723
Okay, what is it?

25:49.756 --> 25:51.358
They are blackened shrimp tacos.

25:51.391 --> 25:52.792
That looks good.

25:52.826 --> 25:53.827
Darling, what is it?

25:53.860 --> 25:55.962
Garlic breast.
Garlic breasts.

25:55.996 --> 25:59.599
With?
Garlic and salt.

25:59.633 --> 26:00.901
Garlic and salt
put on the chicken breast?

26:00.934 --> 26:03.203
She just said garlic salt,
and that's it.

26:03.236 --> 26:04.771
It wasn't very creative.

26:04.804 --> 26:05.421
And, um, that scares me.

26:05.421 --> 26:07.440
And, um, that scares me.

26:07.474 --> 26:09.843
Okay, I got a flat-iron steak,
briefly marinated,

26:09.876 --> 26:11.545
mango salsa
served on a little bit

26:11.578 --> 26:12.546
of pickled vegetables,

26:12.579 --> 26:14.781
finished with avocado butter.

26:14.814 --> 26:16.049
Yum.

26:16.082 --> 26:17.517
Okay, let's go.
Take a taste.

26:21.721 --> 26:22.822
Oh, it's so good.

26:22.856 --> 26:23.990
It was amazing
to taste

26:24.024 --> 26:25.091
Chef Ramsay's dish.

26:25.125 --> 26:26.526
And you could tell
it was gonna taste good

26:26.560 --> 26:28.628
just by looking at it.

26:28.662 --> 26:29.696
Robert, what do you think
of the shrimp?

26:29.729 --> 26:30.830
It's really good.

26:31.998 --> 26:33.433
How's the chicken?

26:36.803 --> 26:40.006
Perla's dish had no flavor.

26:40.040 --> 26:42.108
It's a little bland.

26:42.142 --> 26:43.443
It needs something
to spice it up.

26:43.476 --> 26:46.947
Okay, good, which dish
goes on the menu?

26:46.980 --> 26:47.948
The mango salsa.

26:47.981 --> 26:49.349
The shrimp is really good.

26:49.382 --> 26:52.285
So both the shrimp
and the flat-iron steak

26:52.319 --> 26:53.486
are specials tonight.

26:53.520 --> 26:56.456
I'm disappointed in Perla.

26:56.489 --> 26:58.692
Given her opportunity
to try to shine.

26:58.725 --> 27:02.295
Unfortunately, I think
it fell a bit short.

27:04.731 --> 27:05.421
For tonight's dinner service,

27:05.421 --> 27:06.099
For tonight's dinner service,

27:06.132 --> 27:09.402
Chef Ramsay has insisted
on using only fresh ingredients.

27:09.436 --> 27:11.304
So for the first time,

27:11.338 --> 27:13.773
Mama Rita's,
led by Laura and Chef Perla,

27:13.807 --> 27:15.275
will operate
like a restaurant

27:15.308 --> 27:17.143
and not a catering service.

27:17.177 --> 27:18.578
Hello.

27:18.612 --> 27:19.980
Good to see you guys.

27:20.013 --> 27:21.915
Thank you.
You enjoy now.

27:21.948 --> 27:23.583
Just letting you know
our specials are

27:23.617 --> 27:25.585
Skirt steak
with mango salsa

27:25.619 --> 27:27.787
and blackened shrimp tacos.

27:27.821 --> 27:30.090
The steak special?
Okay.

27:30.123 --> 27:33.259
We're cooking
everything fresh now,

27:33.293 --> 27:35.328
so enjoy your meal.

27:35.362 --> 27:35.421
Chef, you have
anywhere special

27:35.421 --> 27:36.963
Chef, you have
anywhere special

27:36.997 --> 27:38.398
you want me
just doing my thing?

27:38.431 --> 27:39.499
Uh, yeah. As normal.

27:39.532 --> 27:40.500
Running as normal.

27:40.533 --> 27:41.501
How's the specials going?

27:41.534 --> 27:42.669
Specials are going good.

27:42.702 --> 27:44.004
You're gonna have some
of those steaks

27:44.037 --> 27:45.271
coming up now.

27:45.305 --> 27:46.406
I've been pushing it,
so it's coming.

27:46.439 --> 27:47.807
I'm scared about tonight.

27:47.841 --> 27:49.743
Cooking everything fresh
like this,

27:49.776 --> 27:51.645
it's gonna be--
it's gonna be like something

27:51.678 --> 27:52.979
she's never done,
and Perla's got to get

27:53.013 --> 27:54.581
into a whole new mindset.

27:57.851 --> 27:59.119
Perla's team
has quickly produced

27:59.152 --> 28:00.253
the first set of specials.

28:00.286 --> 28:01.254
This is 24, yeah?

28:01.287 --> 28:02.255
Gracias.

28:02.288 --> 28:03.723
All right, I got

28:03.757 --> 28:04.858
your chef specials.

28:04.891 --> 28:05.421
And it appears as though

28:05.421 --> 28:05.892
And it appears as though

28:05.925 --> 28:07.394
the kitchen has adapted well.

28:07.427 --> 28:09.696
But have they really?

28:09.729 --> 28:10.697
You guys good?

28:10.730 --> 28:12.399
Was everything okay?

28:12.432 --> 28:13.667
I'll take it back.

28:13.700 --> 28:14.701
Cut into yours.

28:16.236 --> 28:19.139
Too rare?

28:19.172 --> 28:20.240
What's the matter?

28:20.273 --> 28:21.741
It's rare.

28:21.775 --> 28:22.842
Guys.

28:22.876 --> 28:24.544
You got to cook
the steak.

28:24.577 --> 28:25.612
Look it.

28:25.645 --> 28:27.881
It is raw.
Look at that.

28:29.649 --> 28:30.617
This isn't medium rare,
anyway.

28:30.650 --> 28:31.718
That is rare.

28:31.751 --> 28:33.486
Perla, I want you overseeing

28:33.520 --> 28:34.587
the entrees,

28:34.621 --> 28:35.421
making sure the steaks
are cooked properly.

28:35.421 --> 28:36.623
making sure the steaks
are cooked properly.

28:36.656 --> 28:38.158
And you shouldn't be doing
this little stuff.

28:38.191 --> 28:39.192
You are the chef.

28:39.225 --> 28:40.960
Finally, a voice.

28:40.994 --> 28:42.062
Give me an apron.

28:42.095 --> 28:43.196
I have people back there

28:43.229 --> 28:44.330
that don't know
what they're doing.

28:44.364 --> 28:45.331
So, obviously, I need

28:45.365 --> 28:46.399
to be more hands-on
in the kitchen.

28:46.433 --> 28:47.901
Specials are going,
you guys.

28:47.934 --> 28:49.502
Leave those items out
so we can use them

28:49.536 --> 28:50.570
and get to them easier.

28:50.603 --> 28:52.038
I need these washed
immediately.

28:52.072 --> 28:53.640
Very--muy caliente.

28:53.673 --> 28:55.642
Maria, you're making me
those churros?

28:55.675 --> 28:57.444
Yeah.

28:57.477 --> 28:58.845
Have the refires gone out?

28:58.878 --> 29:00.146
My redo?

29:00.180 --> 29:01.915
Where's my--
did the other one go out yet?

29:01.948 --> 29:05.421
Why'd you--why'd we take one
without the other?

29:05.421 --> 29:06.019
Why'd you--why'd we take one
without the other?

29:06.052 --> 29:07.020
That's incredible.

29:07.053 --> 29:08.354
On the back
of all this negativity,

29:08.388 --> 29:09.622
I finally think the penny's
dropped with Laura.

29:09.656 --> 29:11.157
All of a sudden,
she's found her voice,

29:11.191 --> 29:13.493
and she's treating this service
like it's her last.

29:13.526 --> 29:14.728
Did you get one of 'em yet?

29:14.761 --> 29:16.596
One..

29:16.629 --> 29:17.731
There you go.

29:20.167 --> 29:22.335
Thank you.

29:22.335 --> 29:24.437
Okay.

29:24.470 --> 29:25.805
Here's another steak up.

29:25.838 --> 29:27.306
I need you guys to keep up
on this.

29:27.340 --> 29:29.108
I shouldn't be back here
doing this for you.

29:29.142 --> 29:30.209
Right, Laura,

29:30.243 --> 29:31.944
Let them do it now.

29:31.978 --> 29:33.546
Let them do it now,
yeah?

29:33.579 --> 29:35.148
Laura has shown
that she is willing

29:35.181 --> 29:35.421
to step in
to do whatever it takes

29:35.421 --> 29:36.349
to step in
to do whatever it takes

29:36.382 --> 29:37.650
to help her restaurant.

29:37.684 --> 29:39.118
But now Chef Ramsay is looking

29:39.152 --> 29:41.554
for Perla to do
what she is paid to do:

29:41.587 --> 29:43.289
Run the kitchen.

29:43.322 --> 29:45.358
Perla, I need you to step up
to the mark now, please.

29:45.391 --> 29:47.193
Take control.

29:47.226 --> 29:48.194
You want me to decorate
the plates?

29:48.227 --> 29:49.395
No.
No, let 'em do it.

29:49.429 --> 29:51.197
Look how many staff there are
behind there.

29:51.230 --> 29:52.498
I know,
but I...

29:52.532 --> 29:53.599
They were falling
all over themselves

29:53.633 --> 29:54.767
in the kitchen.

29:54.801 --> 29:56.102
And there were a lot of them
on the line.

29:56.135 --> 29:57.303
This is incredible.

29:57.336 --> 29:59.138
Laura is prepared to go
to hell and back

29:59.172 --> 30:00.606
to make sure
this restaurant survives.

30:00.640 --> 30:02.241
However, I don't get
the same feeling

30:02.275 --> 30:03.443
from the staff.

30:03.476 --> 30:05.421
I don't think
they actually give a damn.

30:05.421 --> 30:05.678
I don't think
they actually give a damn.

30:05.712 --> 30:06.846
Unbelievable.

30:08.915 --> 30:10.149
It's just raw?

30:10.183 --> 30:11.184
It's raw.

30:17.256 --> 30:18.958
Fish is raw.

30:18.991 --> 30:20.960
What?

30:20.993 --> 30:22.862
For God's sake, guys.

30:22.895 --> 30:24.697
Look!

30:24.731 --> 30:26.599
That's not--
there's no excuse.

30:28.735 --> 30:30.470
It's like fish out
of a  sushi bar.

30:30.503 --> 30:31.738
Come on, guys.

30:31.771 --> 30:35.241
If I don't do something
immediately,

30:35.274 --> 30:35.421
It's gonna be gone tomorrow.

30:35.421 --> 30:36.542
It's gonna be gone tomorrow.

30:36.576 --> 30:38.845
I just hope
we can do it.

30:38.878 --> 30:41.881
We got to be able
to do it.

30:41.914 --> 30:43.783
If we don't do it,
it's not gonna work.

30:52.067 --> 30:53.568
Tonight's difficult transition

30:53.602 --> 30:54.970
from cooking frozen
to fresh

30:55.003 --> 30:56.671
only confirmed
what Chef Ramsay

30:56.705 --> 30:58.240
was already feeling.

30:58.273 --> 30:59.608
A lack of confidence.

30:59.641 --> 31:01.076
Tonight didn't exactly go

31:01.109 --> 31:02.277
to plan,
did it?

31:02.310 --> 31:03.412
No, it did not.

31:03.445 --> 31:06.047
Perla is not a head chef.

31:06.081 --> 31:09.651
I think
tonight confirmed that.

31:09.684 --> 31:11.386
Surely you must see that.

31:11.420 --> 31:14.356
I-I don't know
what to do with that.

31:14.389 --> 31:16.858
Perla's family to me.

31:16.892 --> 31:19.261
She's not an employee
that I can just cut,

31:19.294 --> 31:19.381
you know, after so many years
of being by my side.

31:19.381 --> 31:21.763
you know, after so many years
of being by my side.

31:23.732 --> 31:25.066
There was
one strong asset.

31:25.100 --> 31:26.568
Quite refreshing.

31:26.601 --> 31:27.836
And that was you.

31:27.869 --> 31:30.272
I felt like this
was your last service.

31:30.305 --> 31:32.174
You were almost fighting
for your life.

31:32.207 --> 31:33.575
Fighting to stay open.

31:33.608 --> 31:35.377
Fighting for every customer,
every dollar.

31:35.410 --> 31:38.213
And you cared like I've never
seen you care before.

31:38.246 --> 31:40.582
It was the first time
that I actually really started

31:40.615 --> 31:43.084
to believe that you've got
what it takes

31:43.118 --> 31:44.119
to turn this place around.

31:44.152 --> 31:45.854
We're not going back.

31:45.887 --> 31:47.989
Tomorrow,
we are relaunching

31:48.023 --> 31:49.381
this restaurant
as a restaurant

31:49.381 --> 31:50.459
this restaurant
as a restaurant

31:50.492 --> 31:52.627
for the first time
in this town.

31:52.661 --> 31:54.095
Thank you.
Come here.

31:54.129 --> 31:57.432
Thank you so much
for everything.

31:57.466 --> 31:59.568
Get some sleep,
okay?

31:59.601 --> 32:01.303
It was great for Gordon
to sit with me

32:01.336 --> 32:05.240
and feel that somebody
has some faith in me.

32:05.273 --> 32:06.575
I'm an absolute fighter,

32:06.608 --> 32:07.676
and I tell ya,

32:07.709 --> 32:09.377
this is the fight
of my life.

32:13.448 --> 32:15.083
Gordon's looking to revive

32:15.116 --> 32:16.485
Laura's spirit
and avoid

32:16.518 --> 32:18.620
a repeat
of last night's service.

32:18.653 --> 32:19.381
So he's come up
with a surprise solution

32:19.381 --> 32:20.722
So he's come up
with a surprise solution

32:20.755 --> 32:22.858
for the crippling problem
in the kitchen.

32:22.891 --> 32:24.759
Come in, please.
All right.

32:27.729 --> 32:28.897
Now here's the big change.

32:28.930 --> 32:31.066
A humongous change.

32:31.099 --> 32:32.667
Hang on a second.
I've got to get it.

32:36.938 --> 32:39.774
This is Naris.

32:39.808 --> 32:41.042
Hi, Naris.

32:41.076 --> 32:42.210
Hi, guys,
how are you?

32:42.244 --> 32:44.379
Now this lady has been
with me for years.

32:44.412 --> 32:45.380
She's an amazing chef.

32:45.413 --> 32:48.283
Obsessed with
Mexican cuisine.

32:48.316 --> 32:49.381
And I am giving her

32:49.381 --> 32:50.852
And I am giving her

32:50.886 --> 32:53.655
to you as a gift.

32:53.688 --> 32:55.590
What she is going to do

32:55.624 --> 32:58.660
is install
a proper service

32:58.693 --> 33:00.529
in this restaurant.

33:00.562 --> 33:02.264
She's going to consult

33:02.297 --> 33:03.331
properly
for the first time

33:03.365 --> 33:04.633
since you've opened
this place.

33:04.666 --> 33:06.067
I would just like to say

33:06.101 --> 33:07.569
that I'm really,
really excited.

33:07.602 --> 33:08.870
Your restaurant
is beautiful.

33:08.904 --> 33:10.205
Thank you.

33:10.238 --> 33:11.573
We're gonna make
your kitchen beautiful.

33:11.606 --> 33:12.907
We're gonna make
your food beautiful.

33:12.941 --> 33:14.075
Thank you.
It's gonna be great.

33:14.109 --> 33:15.377
Thank you so much.
I'm excited.

33:15.410 --> 33:17.078
One hell of a talented chef.
And I mean that.

33:17.112 --> 33:18.680
Thank you.
Thank you, Madame.

33:18.713 --> 33:19.381
Oh, God.

33:19.381 --> 33:19.981
Oh, God.

33:20.014 --> 33:21.049
I can't believe it.

33:21.082 --> 33:22.350
This is an opportunity
of a lifetime.

33:22.384 --> 33:23.985
She's gonna teach
Perla so much.

33:24.018 --> 33:26.388
For the first time
in a long time,

33:26.421 --> 33:27.589
I have some hope,

33:27.622 --> 33:29.591
and I think we're gonna
get through this.

33:35.363 --> 33:37.565
Gordon is hoping
chef consultant Naris

33:37.599 --> 33:39.100
Will get the kitchen in order,

33:39.134 --> 33:41.903
but there's another huge
change tonight--the menu.

33:41.936 --> 33:43.972
First of all,
look at the color.

33:44.005 --> 33:45.707
Wow.
Oh, my God.

33:45.740 --> 33:47.275
It's like a rainbow.

33:47.308 --> 33:49.381
It's fresh, seasonal,

33:49.381 --> 33:50.011
It's fresh, seasonal,

33:50.044 --> 33:51.946
and it is
incredibly authentic.

33:51.980 --> 33:53.748
Taco salad.
Oh, that looks good.

33:53.782 --> 33:55.417
Carnitas.
Slowly braised.

33:55.450 --> 33:57.051
Ooh.

33:57.085 --> 33:58.052
The sizzling fajitas,

33:58.086 --> 33:59.220
that is gonna be
piping hot.

33:59.254 --> 34:02.457
Please be careful.
Have a taste.

34:02.490 --> 34:04.325
Mm.
Oh, my gosh, you guys.

34:04.359 --> 34:05.627
Mm. The flavor.

34:05.660 --> 34:06.661
Ooh,
that shrimp is good.

34:06.694 --> 34:07.929
The new menu is awesome.

34:07.962 --> 34:09.664
My mother would be
so proud right now.

34:09.697 --> 34:12.033
We're all so excited
about tonight.

34:17.572 --> 34:19.381
With Mama Rita's facing
it's biggest night ever,

34:19.381 --> 34:19.941
With Mama Rita's facing
it's biggest night ever,

34:19.974 --> 34:21.743
Chef Ramsay
is willing to give Perla

34:21.776 --> 34:24.279
one more chance
to command the kitchen,

34:24.312 --> 34:26.748
but this time he has
installed a safety valve,

34:26.781 --> 34:28.650
and her name is Naris.

34:28.683 --> 34:29.984
Right. Uh, Perla.

34:30.018 --> 34:30.985
Yes.

34:31.019 --> 34:32.887
Tonight
we really have to show

34:32.921 --> 34:35.824
that you can adapt
to cooking in a restaurant.

34:35.857 --> 34:37.692
And there's
a big difference.

34:37.725 --> 34:39.394
Naris is here to help you,

34:39.427 --> 34:41.129
but she can't do everything.

34:41.162 --> 34:42.931
So show some spirit

34:42.964 --> 34:44.432
to try and get this place

34:44.466 --> 34:46.568
back up to where
it should have opened

34:46.601 --> 34:47.602
nine months ago, yeah?

34:47.635 --> 34:49.381
Excellent. Good luck.

34:49.381 --> 34:49.404
Excellent. Good luck.

34:49.437 --> 34:51.072
How can we not have
a successful night?

34:51.105 --> 34:52.607
I mean, I've got
one of Gordon's chefs

34:52.640 --> 34:54.075
to work in the kitchen,

34:54.108 --> 34:56.945
and I think Perla
will do all right.

34:56.978 --> 34:58.813
Hello.
What's the name under?

34:58.847 --> 34:59.814
Ben.

34:59.848 --> 35:00.882
Okay.
Come with me.

35:00.915 --> 35:02.450
Here you go.

35:02.484 --> 35:04.385
This is our new menu.
Everything's fresher now.

35:04.419 --> 35:05.787
We're kind of
revamping everything.

35:05.820 --> 35:07.655
I'm just gonna start off
with an order of guacamole.

35:07.689 --> 35:09.157
Guacamole to start?
Steak fajitas?

35:09.190 --> 35:10.992
I will put that order in

35:11.025 --> 35:14.162
and it should be up
shortly.

35:14.195 --> 35:15.330
Call out the order.

35:15.363 --> 35:17.332
Appetizer chicken taquitos,
Miguel.

35:17.365 --> 35:19.267
So make sure
you mark 'em, okay?

35:19.300 --> 35:19.381
Start marking
"appetizer, dinner."

35:19.381 --> 35:21.569
Start marking
"appetizer, dinner."

35:21.603 --> 35:22.604
Perla.

35:22.637 --> 35:23.771
Yes?

35:23.805 --> 35:26.741
I need you to set me up
a fish taco, okay?

35:26.774 --> 35:29.944
Perla, are you ready
for the tacos?

35:29.978 --> 35:31.346
Perla,
listen to me, please.

35:31.379 --> 35:33.748
Let's get 34 out.
Whatever that is.

35:33.781 --> 35:35.316
I need fish tacos.

35:35.350 --> 35:36.384
Set me up the plate,

35:36.417 --> 35:37.585
so I can just put
the fish on there.

35:37.619 --> 35:38.586
Please.

35:38.620 --> 35:40.522
Naris, I need
to pick up 34, yes?

35:40.555 --> 35:41.523
Yeah, I have it.

35:41.556 --> 35:42.524
I just need
a plate set up.

35:42.557 --> 35:44.559
Right. Naris.
Yes, chef.

35:44.592 --> 35:46.828
There's four of them standing
watching you do everything,

35:46.861 --> 35:48.029
and no one's doing
anything else.

35:48.063 --> 35:49.197
You've got
to pick it up, Perla.

35:49.230 --> 35:49.381
Perla, are you ready
for the tacos?

35:49.381 --> 35:50.732
Perla, are you ready
for the tacos?

35:50.765 --> 35:53.068
No, not ready.

35:53.101 --> 35:55.503
Do you believe that?

35:57.272 --> 35:58.707
Cheryl.

35:58.740 --> 36:00.275
Saw you just walk
right past that table.

36:00.308 --> 36:01.376
Everything's
empty on there.

36:01.409 --> 36:02.377
Can't clear it away?

36:02.410 --> 36:03.712
Or do you want me
to do it for you?

36:03.745 --> 36:04.879
This one?
Yeah, it's empty.

36:04.913 --> 36:07.048
You guys all done here?

36:07.082 --> 36:09.718
It's 20 minutes into
dinner service.

36:09.751 --> 36:11.052
Perla,
pull your tickets.

36:11.086 --> 36:12.053
Don't let 'em
hang like that.

36:12.087 --> 36:14.055
And already
Perla is struggling

36:14.089 --> 36:15.457
to organize the kitchen

36:15.490 --> 36:16.624
and her staff.

36:16.658 --> 36:18.059
I've never seen
so many people

36:18.093 --> 36:19.381
standing still
behind a line.

36:19.381 --> 36:20.328
standing still
behind a line.

36:20.362 --> 36:21.329
What are we waiting on?

36:21.363 --> 36:22.330
Firing the orders or not?

36:22.364 --> 36:23.365
Yes, chef.

36:23.398 --> 36:25.033
Perla, I need to start
firing tickets now.

36:25.066 --> 36:27.001
Please?

36:28.303 --> 36:30.672
What's unfolding
in my eyes is fascinating.

36:30.705 --> 36:34.209
I'm just trying to get it set
like a normal restaurant,

36:34.242 --> 36:35.577
not like a canteen

36:35.610 --> 36:37.245
where they're serving
everything en masse.

36:37.278 --> 36:39.047
Perla was still
in the catering mindset,

36:39.080 --> 36:41.516
and with the cooking fresh
and cooking to order,

36:41.549 --> 36:43.918
it's obvious she didn't
know how to do that

36:43.952 --> 36:46.654
and make it happen.

36:48.656 --> 36:49.381
Perla is clearly being exposed

36:49.381 --> 36:50.525
Perla is clearly being exposed

36:50.558 --> 36:51.760
For her lack of leadership,

36:51.793 --> 36:54.262
and the kitchen
is slowly sinking.

36:54.295 --> 36:55.563
Perla, we need to
get organized.

36:55.597 --> 36:57.632
This is not--
this is not working.

36:57.665 --> 36:59.968
But, finally,
an hour into dinner service,

37:00.001 --> 37:02.070
appetizers
are leaving the kitchen.

37:05.540 --> 37:06.674
Okay. All right.

37:06.708 --> 37:09.210
I'll go in and send this
back for you guys.

37:09.244 --> 37:11.079
Perla...

37:11.112 --> 37:13.281
What's the deal with 33?

37:13.314 --> 37:14.916
All right, burnt chips,

37:14.949 --> 37:16.684
no beans,
and not enough cheese.

37:16.718 --> 37:17.886
's sake.

37:17.919 --> 37:19.381
Guys, refire.

37:19.381 --> 37:19.421
Guys, refire.

37:19.454 --> 37:20.555
Some more cheese in there,

37:20.588 --> 37:22.323
but no--don't burn
the chips, yeah?

37:22.357 --> 37:23.458
Sorry.

37:23.491 --> 37:24.759
This is
the difference between

37:24.793 --> 37:26.227
just taking stuff
out of a fridge

37:26.261 --> 37:27.295
and dipping it in fryer

37:27.328 --> 37:28.229
that got fried this morning

37:28.263 --> 37:30.398
or trying
to cook it fresh.

37:30.432 --> 37:32.834
On top of the three pieces
of steak they gave me,

37:32.867 --> 37:34.636
they gave it to me raw.
send it back.

37:34.669 --> 37:35.970
What's wrong with that?

37:37.539 --> 37:39.507
What a  disaster.

37:39.541 --> 37:40.942
It's incredible.

37:40.975 --> 37:42.343
You have the most
amazing looking restaurant

37:42.377 --> 37:43.745
and a great tasting menu,

37:43.778 --> 37:45.480
but if you haven't got the right
staff to pull it off,

37:45.513 --> 37:46.815
you're screwed.

37:46.848 --> 37:48.883
Perla, take your tickets.
Talk to me.

37:48.917 --> 37:49.381
What tables have gone out?

37:49.381 --> 37:50.752
What tables have gone out?

37:50.785 --> 37:53.721
From the first ticket,
Perla was completely absent.

37:53.755 --> 37:54.889
Perla.
Yes.

37:54.923 --> 37:56.491
Please put numbers on them.

37:56.524 --> 37:58.460
I'm not running the table.
I don't know what's going on.

37:58.493 --> 38:02.163
I have to turn my head
100 times to say,

38:02.197 --> 38:03.198
"Perla, what's next?

38:03.231 --> 38:04.833
Call it out.
What are we doing?"

38:04.866 --> 38:06.601
Perla, talk to me.

38:06.634 --> 38:07.702
You got to talk to us.

38:07.735 --> 38:09.070
We're not--
we're not psychic here.

38:09.103 --> 38:10.572
Perla realized
the ticket times

38:10.605 --> 38:12.073
And started
feeling the pressure.

38:12.106 --> 38:13.374
She fell apart.

38:13.408 --> 38:14.776
Perla, take control.

38:14.809 --> 38:16.211
She's not equipped
to work a line.

38:16.244 --> 38:18.079
There's not one ounce
of line material

38:18.112 --> 38:19.381
in that woman.

38:19.381 --> 38:19.414
in that woman.

38:19.447 --> 38:21.716
Perla.
Perla.
Perla.

38:29.659 --> 38:31.928
It's relaunch night
at Mama Rita's.

38:31.961 --> 38:33.997
Perla has shut down,

38:34.030 --> 38:35.598
and the kitchen
is at a standstill.

38:35.632 --> 38:36.833
Laura.
Yes?

38:36.866 --> 38:38.868
Two seconds.

38:40.703 --> 38:43.373
I couldn't have made it
any easier for her.

38:43.406 --> 38:45.341
It's clear now she's not
making the transition

38:45.375 --> 38:46.542
from relying
on  processed,

38:46.576 --> 38:47.977
frozen, defrosted crap

38:48.011 --> 38:49.512
to cooking fresh.

38:49.545 --> 38:51.014
That is not
head chef material.

38:51.047 --> 38:52.015
We're not looking for

38:52.048 --> 38:53.983
a super duper
fine-dining chef.

38:54.017 --> 38:55.370
I'm just looking for a cook
that can cook

38:55.370 --> 38:56.252
I'm just looking for a cook
that can cook

38:56.285 --> 38:58.154
from
start to finish.

38:58.187 --> 39:00.156
Tonight it's been obvious.

39:00.189 --> 39:01.624
Yes. But can--
I will make a comment.

39:01.658 --> 39:02.992
I have--I have a woman

39:03.026 --> 39:04.961
that has stuck with me
through thick and thin

39:04.994 --> 39:05.962
for six years.

39:05.995 --> 39:07.330
Okay,
my big question to you--

39:07.363 --> 39:09.966
Yes.
are you her boss
or are you her friend?

39:09.999 --> 39:10.967
I am her boss, and she--

39:11.000 --> 39:14.837
Wrong.
You are her friend.

39:14.871 --> 39:16.372
It would break my heart

39:16.406 --> 39:19.409
to not have Perla
as my head chef,

39:19.442 --> 39:22.145
but right now
I have to stand back

39:22.178 --> 39:24.647
and really look at
what's best for my business.

39:25.648 --> 39:27.917
Who has?
Perla.

39:27.950 --> 39:28.918
Okay, look at me.

39:28.951 --> 39:31.154
Naris, take over
the line, yes?

39:31.187 --> 39:32.722
You, outside.
Five minutes.

39:32.755 --> 39:34.157
Get some fresh--
take her outside.

39:34.190 --> 39:35.191
Let's go.

39:35.224 --> 39:37.126
Unbelievable.

39:37.160 --> 39:40.063
It's okay.
It's okay.

39:40.096 --> 39:41.064
Look at me.

39:41.097 --> 39:43.132
It's okay.
I'm scared too.

39:43.166 --> 39:46.636
I'm scared
and it's hard, okay?

39:46.669 --> 39:48.638
I'm frightened
to all hell right now.

39:48.671 --> 39:50.339
I've got to try
to pull this off

39:50.373 --> 39:51.407
with the staff that I've got

39:51.441 --> 39:53.209
and this new way
of cooking.

39:53.242 --> 39:54.243
It's okay.

39:54.277 --> 39:55.370
It'll be okay.

39:55.370 --> 39:55.778
It'll be okay.

39:55.812 --> 39:59.944
I promise you
it'll be okay.

40:02.118 --> 40:03.086
One mahi-mahi.

40:03.119 --> 40:04.087
Coming in 30 seconds.

40:04.120 --> 40:05.388
With Perla off the line

40:05.421 --> 40:06.923
And Naris in control...

40:06.956 --> 40:08.458
Get some lime
on here please

40:08.491 --> 40:10.126
And finish these for me?

40:10.159 --> 40:11.994
Mama Rita's kitchen
is finally on track.

40:11.994 --> 40:14.229
Two mahi tacos up.
Piping hot.

40:14.230 --> 40:15.498
Here are the fish tacos.

40:15.531 --> 40:17.600
Can I have
a ramekin please?

40:17.633 --> 40:19.568
Technically, I wasn't
supposed to be on the line.

40:19.569 --> 40:20.803
I was just supposed
to supervise.

40:20.803 --> 40:22.638
But I can't
watch 'em go down.

40:22.671 --> 40:23.739
Good job.
Now keep it up.

40:23.772 --> 40:24.740
Let's finish the night.

40:28.010 --> 40:29.578
All right. Carnitas?

40:29.612 --> 40:32.314
Who got the mahi?

40:32.348 --> 40:34.083
You can do it.
Just focus.

40:34.116 --> 40:35.484
Chef Ramsay's plan

40:35.517 --> 40:37.820
And Naris' rescue
of the kitchen

40:37.853 --> 40:39.822
has resulted in customers
being satisfied.

40:41.423 --> 40:42.891
You like the new relleno?
Yeah, yeah.

40:42.925 --> 40:44.893
And the relaunch ends
on a positive note.

40:44.927 --> 40:46.261
Without Naris,

40:46.295 --> 40:48.263
we wouldn't have been able
to get through tonight.

40:48.297 --> 40:50.032
Thank you so much
for coming in. Thank you.

40:50.065 --> 40:51.533
You guys,
clean up a little.

40:51.567 --> 40:52.668
She knows her stuff.

40:52.701 --> 40:55.037
I mean, she's clearly
a great chef.

41:02.344 --> 41:04.213
While the relaunch
was a success,

41:04.246 --> 41:06.615
Unfortunately no one's
in the mood for celebrating.

41:06.649 --> 41:08.250
Certainly not Perla.

41:08.283 --> 41:11.587
And definitely
not Chef Ramsay.

41:11.620 --> 41:13.322
Tonight was made
more difficult

41:13.355 --> 41:14.623
than it ever had to be.

41:14.657 --> 41:15.624
Perla's not a leader.

41:15.658 --> 41:16.625
She's never gonna step up

41:16.659 --> 41:19.028
to the mark
of a head chef ever.

41:19.061 --> 41:20.896
It's not rocket science.

41:20.929 --> 41:21.964
I know.

41:21.997 --> 41:23.198
Naris,
over the next two weeks,

41:23.232 --> 41:24.600
I want you to separate
the brigade,

41:24.633 --> 41:25.370
focus on the strengths,
the weaknesses.

41:25.370 --> 41:26.001
focus on the strengths,
the weaknesses.

41:26.035 --> 41:28.303
Okay, thank you.

41:28.337 --> 41:29.304
Thank you so much.

41:29.338 --> 41:30.639
It'll be good.
Wonderful.

41:30.673 --> 41:32.374
Perla's strength
isn't being a chef,

41:32.408 --> 41:34.376
and this whole scenario
has brought that to light,

41:34.410 --> 41:35.678
and now
it's blaringly clear

41:35.711 --> 41:37.346
that I need to do
something about it.

41:37.379 --> 41:40.182
Laura, the future success
of this restaurant

41:40.215 --> 41:41.150
is in your hands.

41:41.183 --> 41:43.252
If you don't
extract out of her

41:43.285 --> 41:45.087
everything she knows
about cooking,

41:45.120 --> 41:46.055
you're mad.

41:46.088 --> 41:47.856
It will never,
ever work

41:47.890 --> 41:50.359
if you step backwards
to your old ways.

41:50.392 --> 41:51.560
I won't do that again.

41:51.593 --> 41:53.128
I'm gonna run it
like a restaurant.
Good.

41:53.162 --> 41:55.370
Next time you come you're
gonna see some staff changes.

41:55.370 --> 41:55.631
Next time you come you're
gonna see some staff changes.

41:55.664 --> 41:56.665
Promise me?

41:56.666 --> 41:58.134
I--I give you my word.

41:58.167 --> 42:01.804
Come here. Stand strong.
And good luck.

42:05.808 --> 42:09.145
I've got one hell of a headache.

42:09.178 --> 42:10.880
Did we honestly take a caterer

42:10.913 --> 42:12.948
and turn her
into a restaurateur?

42:12.982 --> 42:14.917
That question
will only be answered

42:14.950 --> 42:16.986
when she finally decides
what to do with Perla

42:17.019 --> 42:18.654
and her kitchen team.

42:18.688 --> 42:20.456
What a nightmare.

42:20.489 --> 42:22.725
Holy chimichangas.

42:25.528 --> 42:27.029
After Gordon left,

42:27.063 --> 42:28.597
Laura worked with Naris

42:28.631 --> 42:30.533
to organize the kitchen
and the staff

42:30.566 --> 42:32.234
into a fully functioning
restaurant.

42:32.268 --> 42:34.036
Once this system
is implemented,

42:34.070 --> 42:35.671
I think that will make it

42:35.705 --> 42:36.806
much, much smoother.

42:36.839 --> 42:38.407
That makes sense.

42:38.441 --> 42:39.775
And after two weeks,

42:39.809 --> 42:41.177
Laura finally
made the staff change

42:41.210 --> 42:43.345
she promised Chef Ramsay.

42:43.379 --> 42:44.547
She installed
a new head chef,

42:44.580 --> 42:46.282
moving Perla
out of the kitchen

42:46.315 --> 42:48.250
and back to catering.

42:48.284 --> 42:49.452
Moving forward now,

42:49.485 --> 42:50.786
there's definitely
gonna be a split

42:50.820 --> 42:52.254
between my catering
and the restaurant.

42:52.288 --> 42:55.057
They are going to be
two different businesses.

42:55.091 --> 42:55.370
Well, guys,
thanks for coming in.

42:55.370 --> 42:56.959
Well, guys,
thanks for coming in.

42:56.992 --> 43:00.029
I don't think
my eyes were open,

43:00.062 --> 43:01.964
and they haven't been open
for a very long time,

43:01.997 --> 43:03.999
and it took Gordon
to come in here and--

43:04.000 --> 43:05.401
whack, whack,
whack, whack, whack,

43:05.401 --> 43:07.852
to get me to open 'em.
