<c.speaker>A shape-shifting potion.

01:05.500 --> 01:08.708
<c.speaker>You'll drink it
and be transformed
into a total stranger.

01:08.708 --> 01:10.375
<c.speaker>[Victor]
Once you're inside,

01:10.375 --> 01:12.291
<c.speaker>you'll find a way
into the treasury

01:12.291 --> 01:14.833
<c.speaker>and steal Elena's
mother's tiara!

01:14.833 --> 01:17.500
<c.speaker>I almost had
the tiara!

01:17.500 --> 01:19.625
<c.speaker>I'll come up
with another plan.

01:19.625 --> 01:22.708
<c.speaker>[reading]

01:22.708 --> 01:24.458
<c.speakerTop>Today's the big day!

01:24.458 --> 01:26.500
<c.speakerTop>We'll do
a last-minute run-through
of your presentation.

01:26.500 --> 01:28.708
<c.speakerTop>Thanks, Elena,
but I've got it memorized.

01:28.708 --> 01:31.833
<c.speakerTop>I practiced in the mirror
for two hours last night.

01:31.833 --> 01:35.875
<c.speakerTop>I'm going to tell my class
everything they ever wanted
to know about monfuegos.

01:35.875 --> 01:37.625
<c.speakerTop>They're going to love it!

01:37.625 --> 01:40.291
<c.speakerTop>- Cinder cone, crater...
-[groaning]

01:40.291 --> 01:42.458
<c.speakerTop>...central vent.

01:42.458 --> 01:45.583
<c.speaker>These are the main structural
features of a monfuego.

01:45.583 --> 01:49.458
<c.speaker>[snoring]

01:49.458 --> 01:53.833
<c.speaker>One, two, three,
eyes on me!

01:53.833 --> 01:56.000
<c.speaker>I mean, eyes on Isabel.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
<c.speaker>Other interesting features
include the lateral vent,

01:59.000 --> 02:01.583
<c.speaker>the secondary cone,
another secondary cone...

02:01.583 --> 02:04.125
<c.speaker>We have to do something
to help Isa!

02:04.125 --> 02:06.875
<c.speaker>Uh, excuse me!
I have a question.

02:06.875 --> 02:09.500
<c.speaker>When does Mount Isabel
blow up?

02:09.500 --> 02:11.125
<c.speaker>-Huh?
-Huh?

02:11.125 --> 02:12.625
<c.speaker>The technical term
is erupt,

02:12.625 --> 02:14.291
<c.speaker>but this monfuego
is dormant,

02:14.291 --> 02:15.833
<c.speaker>so it doesn't erupt.

02:15.833 --> 02:17.291
<c.speaker>-Aw!
-Man!

02:17.291 --> 02:19.375
<c.speaker>But I bet you
could make it erupt

02:19.375 --> 02:22.291
<c.speaker>if you wanted to,
right, Isabel?

02:22.291 --> 02:26.000
<c.speaker>Well, if I had
a little soda ash,

02:26.000 --> 02:28.291
<c.speaker>vinegar, soap,
and some red paint,

02:28.291 --> 02:29.333
<c.speaker>I guess I could.

02:29.333 --> 02:30.708
<c.speaker>Uh, what are you doing?

02:30.708 --> 02:32.875
<c.speaker>Helping you show everyone
what happens

02:32.875 --> 02:34.875
<c.speaker>when a dormant monfuego
becomes active?

02:34.875 --> 02:36.250
<c.speaker>Yeah!

02:36.250 --> 02:39.291
<c.speaker>Oh, okay.
Stand back, everyone.

02:39.291 --> 02:40.500
<c.speaker>Safety goggles on.

02:41.583 --> 02:44.083
<c.speaker>Here we go.

02:45.250 --> 02:48.416
<c.speaker>[laughing]

02:53.875 --> 02:55.958
<c.speaker>-All right!
-Cool!

02:55.958 --> 02:59.000
<c.speaker>Isabel, thank you for showing us
that science can be

02:59.000 --> 03:01.583
<c.speaker>both factual
and entertaining.

03:01.583 --> 03:05.208
<c.speaker>You and your team
should be proud.

03:05.208 --> 03:06.833
<c.speaker>Thank you, Señorita Marisol,

03:06.833 --> 03:08.958
<c.speaker>but this was really
Isabel's project.

03:08.958 --> 03:11.416
<c.speaker>I am so impressed
that I want you

03:11.416 --> 03:14.625
<c.speaker>to represent the school
at the Avalor Science Fair!

03:14.625 --> 03:17.000
<c.speaker>[gasps] But that's
for older kids!

03:17.000 --> 03:19.125
<c.speaker>Yes, but I think
you're ready,

03:19.125 --> 03:21.208
<c.speaker>and here's
the best part!

03:21.208 --> 03:25.583
<c.speaker>Professor Ochoa
from the Science Academy
is going to be the judge!

03:25.583 --> 03:30.333
<c.speaker>The Professor Ochoa?
My favorite scientist
in the whole world?

03:30.333 --> 03:33.416
<c.speaker>Who has
a favorite scientist?

03:33.416 --> 03:35.250
<c.speaker>There's just one catch.

03:35.250 --> 03:37.708
<c.speaker>You only have two days
to get ready.

03:37.708 --> 03:40.500
<c.speaker>No problem. I'll start
brainstorming a new idea.

03:40.500 --> 03:42.250
<c.speaker>Why not enter
with your monfuego?

03:42.250 --> 03:45.375
<c.speaker>Professor Ochoa's probably seen
a thousand model monfuegos.

03:45.375 --> 03:47.708
<c.speaker>I need a project
she's never seen before.

03:47.708 --> 03:49.500
<c.speaker>Don't forget Peaches and Paco.

03:49.500 --> 03:51.750
<c.speaker>You're on guinea pig duty
this weekend, remember?

03:51.750 --> 03:53.208
<c.speaker>Oh! Right.

03:53.208 --> 03:56.083
<c.speaker>Oh! You guys
are getting heavy.

03:56.083 --> 03:59.750
<c.speaker>That's why you need to make sure
they get plenty of exercise,

03:59.750 --> 04:01.416
<c.speaker>and wash them. Ooh--

04:01.416 --> 04:03.458
<c.speaker>and brush their fur.

04:03.458 --> 04:05.458
<c.speaker>[sighs] That's it!

04:05.458 --> 04:08.416
<c.speaker>You just gave me a great idea
for my new project!

04:08.416 --> 04:10.583
<c.speaker>You're forgetting
something else!

04:10.583 --> 04:12.458
<c.speaker>Don't worry,
we'll take it to her.

04:12.458 --> 04:13.458
<c.speaker>What'd she forget?

04:13.458 --> 04:14.583
<c.speaker>Her team!

04:14.583 --> 04:16.125
<c.speaker>Us?

04:20.750 --> 04:22.583
<c.speaker>Hello, real face!

04:22.583 --> 04:25.416
<c.speaker>Mm, I miss you!

04:25.416 --> 04:28.750
<c.speaker>The things you have to do
to become a dark wizard!

04:28.750 --> 04:31.958
<c.speaker>-Help an old lady, dear?
-Ew! Get away!

04:31.958 --> 04:33.416
<c.speaker>-Carla, it's me.
-Papa?

04:33.416 --> 04:34.958
<c.speaker>Don't call me Papa,
Carla.

04:34.958 --> 04:37.583
<c.speaker>Don't call me Carla, Papa!

04:37.583 --> 04:40.250
<c.speaker>I'm Rita now,
and you look ridiculous.

04:40.250 --> 04:43.208
<c.speaker>I think I look fetching,
and that's not the point.

04:43.208 --> 04:45.000
<c.speaker>Did you steal
the tiara yet?

04:45.000 --> 04:46.583
<c.speaker>I'm working on it!

04:46.583 --> 04:49.583
<c.speaker>-Ladies!
-[laughing]

04:49.583 --> 04:52.416
<c.speaker>Your shape-shifting spell
won't last forever.

04:52.416 --> 04:55.583
<c.speaker>You must get the magic jewel
from Elena's mother's tiara

04:55.583 --> 04:57.500
<c.speaker>before your disguise
wears off!

04:57.500 --> 05:00.833
<c.speaker>Without that jewel,
Shuriki cannot build a new wand

05:00.833 --> 05:02.500
<c.speaker>or make us
malvagos.

05:02.500 --> 05:04.958
<c.speaker>I'm trying
as hard as I can!

05:04.958 --> 05:06.458
<c.speaker>I infiltrated
the palace.

05:06.458 --> 05:08.583
<c.speaker>I tried to break in
to the treasury.

05:08.583 --> 05:09.458
<c.speaker>Nothing's working!

05:09.458 --> 05:11.333
<c.speaker>Well, work smarter!

05:11.333 --> 05:14.583
<c.speaker>Go to the palace library
and search for maps
of the castle.

05:14.583 --> 05:17.125
<c.speaker>Look for a back door
to the treasury!

05:17.125 --> 05:20.458
<c.speaker>There has to be
a weak link.

05:20.458 --> 05:22.375
<c.speaker>Are you ready?

05:22.375 --> 05:23.875
<c.speaker>Oh! Ah!

05:23.875 --> 05:25.708
<c.speaker>[laughing]

05:29.000 --> 05:30.625
<c.speaker>Blaze!

05:30.625 --> 05:32.833
<c.speaker>Okay, you've
got accuracy down.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.583
<c.speaker>Now, let's work
on speed.

05:34.583 --> 05:38.125
<c.speaker>Ten coconuts,
ten seconds. Go!

05:38.125 --> 05:40.583
<c.speaker>-Elena!
-Blaze!

05:40.583 --> 05:43.166
<c.speaker>Sorry, Octavio!

05:43.166 --> 05:46.291
<c.speaker>Maybe we should not practice
by that fountain anymore.

05:46.291 --> 05:48.708
<c.speaker>Hey, Isa, did your class
like your presentation?

05:48.708 --> 05:51.250
<c.speaker>Did they! I just picked
to enter the Science Fair,

05:51.250 --> 05:52.458
<c.speaker>and Professor Ochoa
is the judge,

05:52.458 --> 05:53.875
<c.speaker>and I have Peaches and Paco,

05:53.875 --> 05:55.583
<c.speaker>and that gave me
a great idea.

05:55.583 --> 05:57.500
<c.speaker>I'll take that as a yes.

05:57.500 --> 06:01.208
<c.speaker>Okay, ramp starts here
up a 45-degree incline--

06:01.208 --> 06:04.083
<c.speaker>Ooh, I can't believe I get
to meet Professor Ochoa!

06:04.083 --> 06:05.750
<c.speaker>Oh, exercise wheel
over here...

06:05.750 --> 06:07.708
<c.speaker>Isabel, you have
some visitors.

06:07.708 --> 06:09.875
<c.speaker>Hey! What are you guys
doing here?

06:09.875 --> 06:12.166
<c.speaker>Señorita Marisol
sent us to help out.

06:12.166 --> 06:13.875
<c.speaker>-We're your team!
-Huh.

06:13.875 --> 06:17.458
<c.speaker>Wow, that's
really generous, you guys,

06:17.458 --> 06:18.625
<c.speaker>but I can handle this.

06:18.625 --> 06:20.958
<c.speaker>I don't want to ruin
your weekend.

06:20.958 --> 06:23.000
<c.speaker>Good point.
You heard her!

06:23.000 --> 06:25.708
<c.speaker>Uh, your teacher thought
they could help you get ready
for the Science Fair!

06:25.708 --> 06:27.875
<c.speaker>But Quique doesn't
even like science.

06:27.875 --> 06:30.125
<c.speaker>Another good point! Uhh!

06:30.125 --> 06:31.500
<c.speaker>Man, you're fast!

06:31.500 --> 06:33.708
<c.speaker>You've only got
two days, Isa,

06:33.708 --> 06:35.958
<c.speaker>so show us
what we can do to help.

06:35.958 --> 06:37.500
<c.speaker>I'd love your help,

06:37.500 --> 06:40.458
<c.speaker>but it's too crowded here
with all my stuff.

06:40.458 --> 06:43.416
<c.speaker>Hmm. What if I could find
a place in the palace

06:43.416 --> 06:44.750
<c.speaker>big enough to fit
all of you?

06:44.750 --> 06:46.958
<c.speaker>We could turn it
into your very own laboratory!

06:46.958 --> 06:49.583
<c.speaker>Hmm. How big
are we talking?

06:49.583 --> 06:52.583
<c.speaker>♪♪

06:52.583 --> 06:54.000
<c.speaker>Whoa!

06:54.000 --> 06:56.458
<c.speaker>And there's plenty of room
for your team!

06:56.458 --> 06:58.583
<c.speaker>Mm-hmm, plenty of room
for everyone!

06:58.583 --> 07:00.083
<c.speaker>I'd better
get to work.

07:02.625 --> 07:05.583
<c.speaker>Ugh! Why can't I find
another way into the treasury?

07:05.583 --> 07:08.208
<c.speaker>There has to be
a weak link somewhere!

07:08.208 --> 07:09.333
<c.speaker>[Mateo] Ow!

07:09.333 --> 07:11.625
<c.speaker>Ow, ow!

07:11.625 --> 07:14.625
<c.speaker>Hello, weak link!
[chuckles]

07:15.875 --> 07:20.000
<c.speaker>-Hi there, mm, Marco?
-Mateo.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
<c.speaker>This may be way beneath
a wizard of your talent,

07:23.000 --> 07:24.583
<c.speaker>but I lost the key
to my trunk.

07:24.583 --> 07:28.000
<c.speaker>Is there any chance
you might know
an unlocking spell?

07:28.000 --> 07:30.583
<c.speaker>You came to the right wizard.

07:30.583 --> 07:33.750
<c.speaker>Oh, you're a lifesaver!

07:35.833 --> 07:37.583
<c.speaker>A new invention
will solve

07:37.583 --> 07:39.583
<c.speaker>a big problem in schools
all over Avalor!

07:39.583 --> 07:41.166
<c.speaker>Not enough recess?

07:41.166 --> 07:44.000
<c.speaker>The care and feeding
of your classroom guinea pigs!

07:44.000 --> 07:46.458
<c.speaker>Behold, the ExerGroomer!

07:46.458 --> 07:49.625
<c.speaker>Whoa! It's
a guinea pig playground!

07:49.625 --> 07:52.625
<c.speaker>Everyone knows that guinea pigs
need lots of exercise

07:52.625 --> 07:55.291
<c.speaker>and have to get
their fur groomed every day.

07:55.291 --> 07:57.583
<c.speaker>The ExerGroomer
will automatically take care

07:57.583 --> 07:58.750
<c.speaker>of all their daily needs!

07:58.750 --> 08:00.625
<c.speaker>They have to go
up the ramp,

08:00.625 --> 08:03.250
<c.speaker>under the rain shower,
through the straightening combs,

08:03.250 --> 08:05.750
<c.speaker>then past the blower
straight to the prize,

08:05.750 --> 08:07.708
<c.speaker>dry, fluffy,
and ready for dinner.

08:07.708 --> 08:09.083
<c.speaker>I wish I was
a guinea pig!

08:09.083 --> 08:11.750
<c.speaker>I can show you how to adjust
the comb for their fur.

08:11.750 --> 08:13.583
<c.speaker>I've already done
the calculations.

08:13.583 --> 08:15.583
<c.speaker>Uh, those ramps
look pretty steep.

08:15.583 --> 08:17.083
<c.speaker>I triple-checked
the angle.

08:17.083 --> 08:18.625
<c.speaker>Oh! What if you moved
the gears--

08:18.625 --> 08:20.625
<c.speaker>You can leave
the engineering to me!

08:20.625 --> 08:22.708
<c.speaker>But I can make them
spin faster!

08:22.708 --> 08:25.625
<c.speaker>-Quique!
-I'm just trying
to make it better!

08:25.625 --> 08:27.833
<c.speaker>I know...

08:27.833 --> 08:29.750
<c.speaker>I'm sorry, guys.

08:29.750 --> 08:32.458
<c.speaker>I'm just nervous
about the Science Fair,
that's all.

08:32.458 --> 08:33.625
<c.speaker>I want to get
it right.

08:33.625 --> 08:35.500
<c.speaker>And we want to help you
get it right.

08:35.500 --> 08:37.375
<c.speaker>Hey! What does this thing do?

08:37.375 --> 08:39.958
<c.speaker>Can you put down
the twist hook, please!

08:39.958 --> 08:43.333
<c.speaker>Because I need you guys
to help me find

08:43.333 --> 08:45.875
<c.speaker>a much more important tool
that's gone missing.

08:45.875 --> 08:47.000
<c.speaker>Ooh! What is it?

08:47.000 --> 08:50.083
<c.speaker>It's called a...
Twistonator.

08:50.083 --> 08:51.750
<c.speaker>Would you ask
around the palace

08:51.750 --> 08:53.500
<c.speaker>and check
if anyone's seen it?

08:53.500 --> 08:55.125
<c.speaker>Sure! Back in a flash.

08:55.125 --> 08:56.708
<c.speaker>Take all the time you need.

08:57.833 --> 08:59.833
<c.speaker>That'll keep 'em
busy, Peaches.

08:59.833 --> 09:03.000
<c.speaker>Now I can do this
the right way-- my way.

09:04.583 --> 09:06.083
<c.speaker>Excuse me, sir.

09:06.083 --> 09:07.958
<c.speaker>We're looking
for a Twistonator?

09:07.958 --> 09:11.000
<c.speaker>A Twistonator?
Nope, never heard of it.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.416
<c.speaker>[all groan]

09:12.416 --> 09:13.708
<c.speaker>But if we have it,

09:13.708 --> 09:16.625
<c.speaker>it'd be in the This
and That Tower.

09:16.625 --> 09:20.750
<c.speaker>This is where
we keep all the things
we don't need anymore.

09:20.750 --> 09:22.583
<c.speaker>Good luck!

09:22.583 --> 09:24.875
<c.speaker>Yeah, we're gonna
need it.

09:24.875 --> 09:28.083
<c.speaker>Unlocking spell...
Unlocking spell...

09:28.083 --> 09:29.416
<c.speaker>Oh! Here we go.

09:29.416 --> 09:32.333
<c.speaker>"Nitla abrax conzaportil."

09:32.333 --> 09:34.875
<c.speaker>Okay! Let's go
make some magic.

09:34.875 --> 09:38.208
<c.speaker>Rita? Rita?

09:42.750 --> 09:45.333
<c.speaker>Oop! Oh! Ow, my ankle!

09:45.333 --> 09:46.958
<c.speaker>Señorita, let me
help you up.

09:46.958 --> 09:48.958
<c.speaker>You'd better get
a stretcher!

09:48.958 --> 09:50.875
<c.speaker>I'm not supposed
to leave my post.

09:50.875 --> 09:52.625
<c.speaker>So much pain!

09:52.625 --> 09:54.000
<c.speaker>I'll be right back!

09:58.875 --> 10:02.708
<c.speaker>Nitla abrax
conzaportil.

10:05.750 --> 10:07.708
<c.speaker>Hey! Pay attention!

10:07.708 --> 10:12.583
<c.speaker>Nitla abrax conzaportil!

10:13.875 --> 10:15.458
<c.speaker>[sighs]

10:15.458 --> 10:17.750
<c.speaker>Thanks, but my knee's
all better.

10:17.750 --> 10:19.458
<c.speaker>I thought it was
your ankle!

10:19.458 --> 10:20.458
<c.speaker>[Carla] Whatever.

10:21.875 --> 10:24.125
<c.speaker>-That's it!
-[dings]

10:24.125 --> 10:25.500
<c.speaker>All done.

10:25.500 --> 10:27.083
<c.speaker>[squeaking]

10:27.083 --> 10:28.458
<c.speaker>Ready, Peaches?

10:28.458 --> 10:31.250
<c.speaker>Time to make
Science Fair history!

10:33.583 --> 10:34.958
<c.speaker>There you are!

10:34.958 --> 10:38.000
<c.speaker>I've been looking
everywhere for you!

10:38.000 --> 10:41.291
<c.speaker>Oh, for me?
I mean... hello.

10:41.291 --> 10:42.583
<c.speaker>Where'd you go before?

10:42.583 --> 10:43.833
<c.speaker>To unlock my trunk!

10:43.833 --> 10:45.958
<c.speaker>But your spell
didn't work.

10:45.958 --> 10:49.583
<c.speaker>Well, of course. You need
a tambourina to cast it.

10:49.583 --> 10:51.208
<c.speaker>Oh! Can I try it?

10:51.208 --> 10:54.583
<c.speaker>Only a trained wizard should use
something this powerful.

10:54.583 --> 10:56.333
<c.speaker>See that statue
over there?

10:56.333 --> 11:00.875
<c.speaker>It used to be Fiero,
the most dangerous malvago
in Avalor...

11:00.875 --> 11:03.458
<c.speaker>-Really?
-But thanks to my tambourina,

11:03.458 --> 11:04.833
<c.speaker>he's no longer a threat.

11:04.833 --> 11:07.833
<c.speaker>Hmm! Will he be
that way forever?

11:07.833 --> 11:10.125
<c.speaker>Well, I did discover
a reversal potion,

11:10.125 --> 11:13.250
<c.speaker>but, trust me, the kingdom's
better off this way.

11:13.250 --> 11:15.291
<c.speaker>Now, let's go
unlock that trunk.

11:15.291 --> 11:18.458
<c.speaker>I, uh, already got
someone else to open it.

11:18.458 --> 11:22.000
<c.speaker>But there is something
you can do for me.

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
<c.speaker>I've always wanted a tour
of the royal treasury.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.750
<c.speaker>Ah, wish I could,
but they keep the treasury
under lock and key.

11:28.750 --> 11:30.958
<c.speaker>I thought a wizard
powerful enough to beat

11:30.958 --> 11:33.458
<c.speaker>a malvago
wouldn't need a key.

11:33.458 --> 11:35.000
<c.speaker>Guess I was wrong!

11:35.000 --> 11:37.750
<c.speaker>Wait! I don't need a key.
I can open it with a spell.

11:37.750 --> 11:40.000
<c.speaker>Oh! Really!

11:40.000 --> 11:41.166
<c.speaker>Uh, yeah.

11:41.166 --> 11:43.458
<c.speaker>I suppose I could give
you a quick peek.

11:43.458 --> 11:45.583
<c.speaker>After all, I'll be there
to guard the jewels.

11:45.583 --> 11:47.708
<c.speaker>Lead the way, Marco!

11:47.708 --> 11:50.500
<c.speaker>-Mateo.
-Does it really matter?

11:50.500 --> 11:52.208
<c.speaker>[Quique] I think I found it!

11:52.208 --> 11:53.333
<c.speaker>Look!

11:53.333 --> 11:55.833
<c.speaker>Well, it is twisty.

11:55.833 --> 11:57.875
<c.speaker>It's gotta be
the Twistonator!

11:57.875 --> 11:58.875
<c.speaker>What does it do?

11:58.875 --> 12:00.458
<c.speaker>It looks like
a hammer.

12:00.458 --> 12:02.250
<c.speaker>-[sizzling]
-Aah!

12:02.250 --> 12:06.458
<c.speaker>[screaming]

12:10.250 --> 12:11.333
<c.speaker>Ooh!

12:11.333 --> 12:13.583
<c.speaker>That was... awesome!

12:13.583 --> 12:14.875
<c.speaker>My turn!

12:14.875 --> 12:18.125
<c.speaker>[screaming]

12:18.125 --> 12:19.833
<c.speaker>[laughing]

12:19.833 --> 12:23.208
<c.speaker>Quique, we have
to get it to Isabel!

12:23.208 --> 12:24.250
<c.speaker>[squeaking]

12:24.250 --> 12:25.416
<c.speaker>Here we go, guys!

12:28.833 --> 12:33.625
<c.speaker>[squeaking]

12:33.625 --> 12:35.458
<c.speaker>Oh, no, no!
This is not happening!

12:42.458 --> 12:44.125
<c.speaker>No, Paco, come back!

12:51.875 --> 12:53.291
<c.speaker>-Uh...
-Isa!

12:53.291 --> 12:55.708
<c.speaker>-Oh!
-Huh?

12:55.708 --> 12:57.000
<c.speaker>I have to stop
the gears!

12:57.000 --> 12:58.458
<c.speaker>We found
the Twistonator!

12:58.458 --> 13:00.083
<c.speaker>The what? Whoa!

13:00.083 --> 13:02.500
<c.speaker>Oh! Uh!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

13:02.500 --> 13:04.000
<c.speaker>[squeaking]

13:05.708 --> 13:07.500
<c.speaker>Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

13:07.500 --> 13:09.708
<c.speaker>Whoa! Uh!

13:11.458 --> 13:12.958
<c.speaker>No!

13:12.958 --> 13:14.333
<c.speaker>[clanging]

13:14.333 --> 13:16.000
<c.speaker>My ExerGroomer!

13:16.000 --> 13:17.333
<c.speaker>What is that thing?

13:17.333 --> 13:19.125
<c.speaker>The Twistonator?

13:19.125 --> 13:21.375
<c.speaker>There's no such thing
as a Twistonator!

13:21.375 --> 13:22.583
<c.speaker>I made it up!

13:22.583 --> 13:24.708
<c.speaker>Wait, you made up
the Twistonator?

13:24.708 --> 13:26.083
<c.speaker>You lied to us?

13:27.708 --> 13:29.083
<c.speaker>I didn't mean to,

13:29.083 --> 13:31.500
<c.speaker>but I have to do well
at the Science Fair!

13:31.500 --> 13:33.208
<c.speaker>Professor Ochoa
will be there!

13:33.208 --> 13:35.375
<c.speaker>She'll actually be
judging my work,

13:35.375 --> 13:36.833
<c.speaker>and you guys
were just--

13:36.833 --> 13:37.833
<c.speaker>Just what?

13:39.083 --> 13:41.125
<c.speaker>Getting in the way.

13:41.125 --> 13:43.375
<c.speaker>Well, if that's
how you feel,

13:43.375 --> 13:46.291
<c.speaker>then we'll get out
of your way for good.

13:46.291 --> 13:48.583
<c.speaker>You can do it
all yourself.

13:48.583 --> 13:49.958
<c.speaker>Bye, Isabel.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.333
<c.speaker>[sighs]

13:57.625 --> 13:59.125
<c.speaker>Are you guys
done already?

13:59.125 --> 14:01.458
<c.speaker>-The project isn't...
-...but we are.

14:01.458 --> 14:04.416
<c.speaker>-What's going on?
-You should ask Isabel.

14:10.250 --> 14:13.083
<c.speaker>[squeaking]

14:13.083 --> 14:16.000
<c.speaker>Whoa. What is that?

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
<c.speaker>Don't touch the hammer.
Trust me.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.833
<c.speaker>Okay. Uh, your friends
are leaving.

14:21.833 --> 14:25.250
<c.speaker>-I know.
-Well, are you sure it's
a good idea to let them go?

14:25.250 --> 14:28.166
<c.speaker>From the looks of things,
you could use a good team.

14:28.166 --> 14:31.625
<c.speaker>I'll figure it out myself!
I didn't ask for a team.

14:31.625 --> 14:35.500
<c.speaker>Ah. Well, I know
what you mean.

14:35.500 --> 14:37.000
<c.speaker>You do?

14:37.000 --> 14:38.583
<c.speaker>When I became
crown princess,

14:38.583 --> 14:40.416
<c.speaker>I didn't ask
for a team, either,

14:40.416 --> 14:42.708
<c.speaker>but the law said
I needed a grand council

14:42.708 --> 14:45.250
<c.speaker>until I was old enough
to be queen,

14:45.250 --> 14:48.458
<c.speaker>and now I don't know
what I'd do without them.

14:48.458 --> 14:51.750
<c.speaker>Your friends can help you
fix your problems...

14:51.750 --> 14:54.375

to get rid of you like that.

<c.speaker>I was so worried
about my project

17:32.125 --> 17:35.333
<c.speaker>I didn't give you
the chance to help.

<c.speaker>I'm sorry, guys.

<c.speaker>Will you come back? Please?

17:41.458 --> 17:43.583
<c.speaker>So now you want
our help?

<c.speaker>I want my friends back.

than any science project.

<c.speaker>We better
get started, then.

until the fair.

having a quick look-see.

a minute!

do not touch the door.

18:16.333 --> 18:19.958
<c.speaker>You were right, Cristina,
the ramps were too steep.

<c.speaker>You know, if we use brushes,
the combs won't get stuck
in their fur.

18:23.291 --> 18:26.875
<c.speaker>Hey! I found this stuff
in your This and That Tower.

18:26.875 --> 18:29.291
<c.speaker>Maybe we can use it
to fix your ExerGroomer.

18:29.291 --> 18:33.000
<c.speaker>Good thinking, Quique,
but we don't have enough time
to put it all together!

18:33.000 --> 18:34.291
<c.speaker>[Mateo] Maybe I can help!

18:34.291 --> 18:37.125
<c.speaker>Elena asked me to figure out
what this really is.

18:37.125 --> 18:39.333
<c.speaker>It turns out
this is an ancient,

18:39.333 --> 18:41.458
<c.speaker>magical Maruvian tool.

18:41.458 --> 18:43.500
<c.speaker>It's called a NicoQuixo.

18:43.500 --> 18:44.958
<c.speaker>What does that mean?

18:44.958 --> 18:46.500
<c.speaker>"Smash everything in sight"?

18:46.500 --> 18:49.333
<c.speaker>No, it does
the hammering for you.

18:49.333 --> 18:51.875
<c.speaker>That's just what we need!

18:51.875 --> 18:54.291
<c.speaker>Ready? One...

18:54.291 --> 18:56.416
<c.speaker>two... three!

18:58.375 --> 19:01.333
<c.speaker>[both] Whoa! Uh! Aah!

19:05.583 --> 19:07.208
<c.speaker>All right!

19:07.208 --> 19:10.333
<c.speaker>Now we just need
to reassemble the rest of it,
and we're done.

19:15.708 --> 19:18.000
<c.speaker>Look sharp!
Here she comes!

19:18.000 --> 19:20.250
<c.speaker>-Ready, guys?
-[squeaks]

19:24.250 --> 19:25.500
<c.speaker>Hello, I'm Professor--

19:25.500 --> 19:28.375
<c.speaker>Professor Ochoa! I know!
I am your biggest fan!

19:28.375 --> 19:29.291
<c.speaker>[gasps]

19:29.291 --> 19:32.000
<c.speaker>And what are we
presenting today?

19:32.000 --> 19:35.958
<c.speaker>Um, ahem, this new invention
will solve a big problem

19:35.958 --> 19:37.833
<c.speaker>in schools
all over Avalor--

19:37.833 --> 19:40.833
<c.speaker>the care and feeding
of your classroom guinea pigs.

19:40.833 --> 19:43.583
<c.speaker>Behold, the ExerGroomer.

19:43.583 --> 19:45.583
<c.speaker>Release the guinea pigs!

20:05.458 --> 20:06.583
<c.speaker>[dings]

20:08.291 --> 20:10.000
<c.speaker>Mm-hmm.

20:11.750 --> 20:14.750
<c.speaker>Was that mm-hmm good
or mm-hmm bad?

20:14.750 --> 20:17.208
<c.speaker>I'm crossing my fingers
for mm-hmm good,

20:17.208 --> 20:19.000
<c.speaker>and my toes.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.208
<c.speaker>[chirps]

20:20.208 --> 20:22.333
<c.speaker>[Shuriki] Congratulations!

20:22.333 --> 20:26.583
<c.speaker>You've managed to pack
a lifetime of failure
into a single week.

20:26.583 --> 20:30.333
<c.speaker>Did I, or did I just learn
that there's a powerful malvago

20:30.333 --> 20:33.166
<c.speaker>frozen like a statue
in the palace garden?

20:33.166 --> 20:34.416
<c.speaker>A malvago?

20:34.416 --> 20:36.000
<c.speaker>A malvago could get us

20:36.000 --> 20:38.333
<c.speaker>into the treasury
to steal that tiara!

20:38.333 --> 20:40.416
<c.speaker>That's just what
I was thinking.

20:40.416 --> 20:42.750
<c.speaker>And have either of you
thought about the fact

20:42.750 --> 20:44.000
<c.speaker>that he is a statue?

20:44.000 --> 20:45.333
<c.speaker>The royal wizard--

20:45.333 --> 20:47.416
<c.speaker>Marco, Mason,
it doesn't matter--

20:47.416 --> 20:49.083
<c.speaker>he has a reversal potion.

20:49.083 --> 20:50.958
<c.speaker>It'll be easy to steal
from his workshop.

20:50.958 --> 20:53.458
<c.speaker>I can play him like a violin.

20:53.458 --> 20:55.875
<c.speaker>I despise music,

20:55.875 --> 20:59.583
<c.speaker>but I'm willing
to make an exception.

20:59.583 --> 21:05.125
<c.speaker>And the winner
of the Avalor Science Fair is...

21:05.125 --> 21:06.750
<c.speaker>the ExerGroomer!

21:06.750 --> 21:10.000
<c.speaker>-We won! We won!
-Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

21:10.000 --> 21:12.625
<c.speaker>Congratulations.
Here's your trophy

21:12.625 --> 21:15.875
<c.speaker>and a box
of Avaloran chocolate.

21:15.875 --> 21:17.208
<c.speaker>Isa, you did it!

21:17.208 --> 21:18.458
<c.speaker>We all did this,

21:18.458 --> 21:20.250
<c.speaker>so we should all
share the prize.

21:20.250 --> 21:23.000
<c.speaker>Keep the trophy!
I'll take the chocolate.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.833
<c.speaker>Isabel, I am so impressed
with your work

21:25.833 --> 21:28.833
<c.speaker>that I'd like to invite you
to take my class

21:28.833 --> 21:30.583
<c.speaker>at the Science Academy.

21:30.583 --> 21:33.416
<c.speaker>You want me
to go to college?

21:33.416 --> 21:38.708
<c.speaker>[laughs] Not college,
just one class after school,

21:38.708 --> 21:40.583
<c.speaker>one day a week.
Interested?

21:40.583 --> 21:45.000
<c.speaker>Yes! But only
if my whole team
can go, too.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.208
<c.speaker>Whoa, whoa, whoa.

21:46.208 --> 21:47.833
<c.speaker>One school at a time
for me.

21:47.833 --> 21:49.625
<c.speaker>[both] Yeah!

21:49.625 --> 21:51.625
<c.speaker>Can you believe it, Elena?

21:51.625 --> 21:53.166
<c.speaker>I'm going to college!

21:53.166 --> 21:55.083
<c.speaker>Of course I can, Isa!

21:55.083 --> 21:57.375
<c.speaker>When it comes to you,

21:57.375 --> 21:59.250
<c.speaker>anything is possible.

22:03.625 --> 22:06.708
<c.speaker>♪♪
