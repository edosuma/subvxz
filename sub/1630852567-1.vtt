WEBVTT

00:01.265 --> 00:03.527
You haven't seen me
in such a long time.

00:03.562 --> 00:05.692
Yeah, I haven't seen you
since Katie died.

00:05.727 --> 00:07.395
I didn't leave
because of you.

00:07.430 --> 00:09.527
Well, I killed Katie.
And then you left.

00:09.562 --> 00:11.428
So yeah, yeah,
I think you did.

00:11.793 --> 00:13.461
I have a hole in my spine?

00:13.496 --> 00:15.428
There is a small
chance, however,

00:15.463 --> 00:19.197
<i>if we operate that it could
affect your ability to walk.</i>

00:19.232 --> 00:21.296
Ah!

00:23.298 --> 00:25.428
Ah, okay.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:25.463 --> 00:27.692
Yeah? Liam, you're burning up,
you're burning up.

00:29.694 --> 00:32.032
I think your rib
pierced your intercostal vein.

00:33.166 --> 00:35.098
It's not clean
and it won't last long,

00:35.133 --> 00:36.461
but I need you, I need you
to apply pressure.

00:53.496 --> 00:56.296

02:40.463 --> 02:41.890
I haven't been out in so long,

02:41.925 --> 02:43.824
I put back half a bottle
of tequila.

02:43.859 --> 02:45.395
Avery--

03:08.727 --> 03:10.692
Okay, then.

03:19.958 --> 03:22.230
Careful!
Watch the marker.

03:26.628 --> 03:28.593
- Hey, Mac!
- Hey.

03:28.628 --> 03:29.890
I heard you were back today!

03:33.529 --> 03:34.791
Yes!
- Yeah.

03:36.760 --> 03:38.692
Hey, how do you eat
at a scene like this?

03:38.727 --> 03:40.494
Yeah, you don't wanna see me
hangry, Mac.

03:40.529 --> 03:42.659
Come on.
You feeling all right?

03:42.694 --> 03:44.923
I'll be all right when people
stop asking me

03:44.958 --> 03:46.659
if I'm all right.
- Loud and clear, Boss.

03:46.694 --> 03:48.560
It's good to have you back.

03:49.826 --> 03:51.263
So she fell crossing
the bridge,

03:51.298 --> 03:53.857
got caught in the netting?
Any witnesses?

03:53.892 --> 03:56.197
Ah, that one called it in.

03:56.232 --> 03:58.296
Stumbled into a pool of blood,
so I suspect the victim

03:58.331 --> 04:00.890
had been dead for hours
by then.

04:08.628 --> 04:10.560
Tell me about
the new coroner.

04:10.595 --> 04:12.857
Oh, well...

04:12.892 --> 04:14.626
he's no Jenny.

04:15.793 --> 04:17.428
What did you put
for Number Three?

04:17.463 --> 04:19.362
Eli doesn't like when
you cheat.

04:19.397 --> 04:20.890
How would he know if I cheat?

04:24.793 --> 04:26.329
- You told him.
- He guessed!

04:26.364 --> 04:28.329
Your answers were exactly
the same as mine.

04:28.364 --> 04:30.395
You're a terrible cheater.

04:30.430 --> 04:33.296
I was always top of my class,
I never had a reason to cheat.

04:33.331 --> 04:34.923
This is bullsh--

04:36.529 --> 04:38.560
Morning, everyone.

04:38.595 --> 04:40.197
Let's see that paperwork.

04:41.397 --> 04:42.890
Dr. Thompson.

04:42.925 --> 04:45.692
Ah, Dennis, great.

04:47.331 --> 04:48.890
River.

04:48.925 --> 04:50.989
Huh.

04:51.024 --> 04:52.824
I'm not mad,

04:52.859 --> 04:53.923
I'm just, uh...

04:55.331 --> 04:56.758
disappointed.

05:05.397 --> 05:07.923
- I miss Dr. Cooper.
- Inside voice, inside voice.

05:07.958 --> 05:10.032
Yeah, I'm just taking
a look at it now.

05:14.024 --> 05:15.824
Bruising on the wrists,
forearm.

05:18.067 --> 05:19.659
There's a contusion,

05:19.694 --> 05:21.461
but the skull and brain
are intact.

05:21.496 --> 05:23.692
It might've knocked her out,
but it didn't kill her.

05:23.727 --> 05:25.692
Maybe she hit her head
on the railing

05:25.727 --> 05:27.626
as she fell into the bird
netting?

05:27.661 --> 05:29.065
Then she lost two-thirds
of her blood volume

05:29.100 --> 05:31.593
while she was hanging there.
- Yeah.

05:31.628 --> 05:33.461
Victim is pale inside the eyes.

05:33.496 --> 05:35.065
She bled out.

05:35.100 --> 05:36.857
But how?

05:41.067 --> 05:41.999
Hey, Jenny!

05:45.694 --> 05:47.395
- Morning, Jenny.
- Hey, Tyler.

05:47.430 --> 05:49.593
These are for the store.

05:49.628 --> 05:52.329
Ooh! Wow, I'm gonna get rich
off your uh,

05:52.364 --> 05:54.428
green thumb, huh?
- It's actually just science.

05:54.463 --> 05:56.626
Ah, hey, your kid called
the store.

05:56.661 --> 05:59.065
Oh! I missed our weekly call.

05:59.100 --> 06:00.989
Yeah, that's what he said.

06:01.024 --> 06:02.725
I thought I ought to check
to make sure you all

06:02.760 --> 06:04.494
didn't get dragged off
by bears.

06:04.529 --> 06:06.758
I'm sorry, did you
drive all the way out here

06:06.793 --> 06:08.494
to tell me that?
- Uh, no.

06:09.496 --> 06:11.659
I'm looking for George.

06:11.694 --> 06:13.857
Long hair, teenager.
- No.

06:13.892 --> 06:15.725
Big "Dragons and Lairs"
game today.

06:17.925 --> 06:20.395
Hayley, is that like a-
like a role-playing thing?

06:20.430 --> 06:22.395
He got really into that stuff
after his brain injury.

06:23.661 --> 06:26.758
It's as hot as MMA fighting,
but in a different way.

06:26.793 --> 06:28.626
Got it.

06:28.661 --> 06:30.824
Hey, do you guys mind if I walk
up to Cell Reception Hill

06:30.859 --> 06:32.461
just to see if I can call
Ross back?

06:32.496 --> 06:34.032
Of course not,
our land is your land.

06:44.024 --> 06:45.824
I'm surprised you're awake
after this morning.

06:47.826 --> 06:49.791
Hey, I see you.

06:51.430 --> 06:53.098
You'd forget your head
if it wasn't attached.

06:53.133 --> 06:54.956
Ah. Uh-huh.

06:54.991 --> 06:56.527
That's what my mother
used to say.

06:56.562 --> 06:58.494
- Mm-hmm.
- How's your first day back?

06:58.529 --> 06:59.956
You checking up on me?

06:59.991 --> 07:02.824
Hey, the attack and the surgery
didn't kill me,

07:02.859 --> 07:04.725
so they must've made me
stronger.

07:04.760 --> 07:06.692
I don't think
that's how it works.

07:06.727 --> 07:08.659
I promise you.

07:08.694 --> 07:10.461
No one's ever gonna get
the drop on me again.

07:10.496 --> 07:12.032
I don't like the sound
of that,

07:12.067 --> 07:13.725
you still need
to take care of you,

07:13.760 --> 07:15.989
especially when I'm not around.
It's not like a painting,

07:16.024 --> 07:18.395
you know, just throw the canvas
away and start over.

07:18.430 --> 07:20.593
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

07:20.628 --> 07:22.395
Here. Your anti-inflammatories.

07:23.496 --> 07:24.956
Thanks.

07:39.166 --> 07:40.923
Yo.

07:40.958 --> 07:42.593
Whoa! Ooh!

07:42.628 --> 07:45.098
You sneak up on a guy,
like--

07:45.133 --> 07:46.791
My whole life flashed before
my eyes there, Mac.

07:46.826 --> 07:48.164
- I'll bet that was depressing.
- Oh!

07:50.199 --> 07:51.956
You know what, maybe I should
drive to the autopsy, huh?

07:51.991 --> 07:53.626
I still remember how
to drive.

07:53.661 --> 07:55.362
All right.

08:03.661 --> 08:05.395
These look like...

08:05.430 --> 08:07.461
recent surgical scars.

08:08.595 --> 08:10.593
Maybe she bled from there?

08:10.628 --> 08:12.527
It doesn't look like
it opened up,

08:12.562 --> 08:14.461
but I'll need to check
the subcutaneous tissue

08:14.496 --> 08:16.692
to confirm that.
- Hey Dennis, River.

08:16.727 --> 08:18.692
Detective Mcavoy,
welcome back.

08:18.727 --> 08:21.692
- Uh, what's this?
- You must be Dr. Eli Thompson.

08:21.727 --> 08:23.758
I'm Detective Donovan McAvoy,
Homicide.

08:23.793 --> 08:25.956
Are you homicide
and also a pathologist?

08:25.991 --> 08:27.593
No.

08:27.628 --> 08:29.197
Then why are you
in my autopsy suite?

08:29.232 --> 08:31.197
I need what you have
on our victim.

08:31.232 --> 08:32.593
You're on my turf.

08:32.628 --> 08:34.494
You show me yours.

08:34.529 --> 08:36.659
Victim is Colleen Hough.

08:36.694 --> 08:38.527
Husband reported her missing
last night.

08:38.562 --> 08:40.857
Did you find anything
suspicious?

08:42.133 --> 08:44.725
She bled out,
and there's some bruising.

08:44.760 --> 08:46.725
We've got fresh finger
bruises on the decedent's arms.

08:46.760 --> 08:48.890
But there are older bruises
as well.

08:48.925 --> 08:50.791
Are we talking long-term
abuse?

08:50.826 --> 08:53.098
All right, could you
let us finish?

08:53.133 --> 08:55.461
Are the bruises consistent
with long term abuse, Doctor?

08:55.496 --> 08:57.560
It's always the husband.

08:57.595 --> 08:59.593
Isn't that what you guys say?

08:59.628 --> 09:02.461
That's why I'm never
getting one.

09:02.496 --> 09:04.659
Now you've upset
my people.

09:04.694 --> 09:06.494
Out!

09:06.529 --> 09:08.230
- Told you.
- Yes!

09:08.265 --> 09:09.197
Yes, and tell all the others.

09:10.595 --> 09:12.164
Dennis!

09:12.199 --> 09:14.659
Where are the forms?

09:14.694 --> 09:16.164
I can't wait 'til Jenny
gets back.

09:18.595 --> 09:21.461
<i>Hey, Mom. Isn't your
leave of absence done yet?</i>

09:21.496 --> 09:23.164
Okay, hold on.

09:28.133 --> 09:30.065
<i>Well, I'm gonna stay
until I can harvest</i>

09:30.100 --> 09:32.230
<i>my carrots and squash.</i>

09:32.265 --> 09:34.560
Oh, so you tell time
by harvest now?

09:34.595 --> 09:36.131
That's a little weird,

09:36.166 --> 09:37.923
do you have a piece of straw
hanging out of your mouth

09:37.958 --> 09:39.461
at this very moment?

09:39.496 --> 09:41.461
Hey, you know what, I, uh...

09:41.496 --> 09:43.857
I made compost all by myself.

09:43.892 --> 09:45.659
Do you know how transformative
it is to take waste

09:45.694 --> 09:47.956
and turn it into something
of value?

09:47.991 --> 09:49.923
<i>Thank you, hordes of little,
red, wiggly worms.</i>

09:51.133 --> 09:53.032
<i>You sound happy, Mom.</i>

09:53.067 --> 09:54.494
How are you?

09:54.529 --> 09:56.824
I'm good. It's a little
weird, I'm kind of...

09:56.859 --> 09:58.725
I'm kind of like a third wheel

09:58.760 --> 10:00.989
on an octogenarian honeymoon.

10:01.024 --> 10:03.065
You don't even know
what that word means.

10:03.100 --> 10:05.197
It means if you don't come
soon, I'm gonna move out.

10:09.265 --> 10:11.758
Honey, look, I just...

10:11.793 --> 10:13.230
you know, I need a little bit
more time.

10:13.265 --> 10:15.626
I need to...

10:15.661 --> 10:17.824
I just need to stay here
until I believe

10:17.859 --> 10:19.626
that not everybody I love
is gonna die.

10:19.661 --> 10:21.692
Or leave. You know?

10:22.991 --> 10:24.560
I'm-I'm just-I'm working on it
every day. I am--

10:24.595 --> 10:26.494
Sorry, you just cut out.

10:26.529 --> 10:28.725
What did you just say?
- Yeah, Honey, can you hear me?

10:28.760 --> 10:30.560
What? You're-I can't...

10:30.595 --> 10:32.032
Ross.

10:32.067 --> 10:33.956
Argh!

10:33.991 --> 10:35.659
Shoot.

10:39.298 --> 10:41.263
Huh.

11:34.859 --> 11:36.296
Okay,
so you found George.

11:36.331 --> 11:38.164
Uh, name, please?

11:39.166 --> 11:40.923
Ah, Jenny Cooper,

11:40.958 --> 11:42.923
I'm staying at the Fincher's
Airbnb.

11:42.958 --> 11:44.296
Oh yeah, I've seen
you around.

11:44.331 --> 11:46.230
Occupation, Mrs. Cooper?

11:46.265 --> 11:48.329
Uh, botanist.

11:48.364 --> 11:50.230
You see anyone else around
when you found him?

11:50.265 --> 11:52.626
No.

11:52.661 --> 11:54.263
You didn't touch the body,
did you?

11:54.298 --> 11:56.296
- No.
- "No." Okay.

11:58.727 --> 12:00.296
Well, we are done for now,
thank you.

12:04.199 --> 12:06.362
Make sure you have the
pathologist aspirate the lungs

12:06.397 --> 12:08.197
before you rule it a drowning.

12:27.364 --> 12:29.329
<i>Hey, Jenny!
Yeah?</i>

12:29.364 --> 12:31.164
<i>Liam, you're burning up.</i>

12:31.199 --> 12:33.098
Oh, God.

12:40.331 --> 12:42.989
I love you.

13:44.364 --> 13:46.362
George.

13:52.166 --> 13:54.032
What are you doing?

13:56.265 --> 13:58.263
Come on.

14:00.529 --> 14:03.395
I didn't kill my wife.

14:03.430 --> 14:05.395
Colleen was covered
in bruises.

14:07.298 --> 14:10.362
We had a fight last night.

14:10.397 --> 14:12.428
I grabbed her.
Maybe I bruised her?

14:12.463 --> 14:15.461
But I didn't kill her!

14:15.496 --> 14:17.395
She has old bruises too,
Marcus.

14:17.430 --> 14:19.461
Looks like long-term abuse.

14:19.496 --> 14:22.065
My wife had knee surgery,
you know, two weeks ago.

14:22.100 --> 14:24.230
Her physiotherapist said
she was supposed to walk on it,

14:24.265 --> 14:26.461
but she didn't feel ready.

14:26.496 --> 14:28.428
I told her she just had
to go for it,

14:28.463 --> 14:31.131
and I... made her go for a walk
around the block.

14:32.331 --> 14:35.230
When she came back, she said
someone was following her.

14:35.265 --> 14:38.065
- You didn't go with her?
- No, I did after that.

14:38.100 --> 14:39.824
I never saw anyone.

14:39.859 --> 14:42.263
I thought she was just avoiding
getting on her feet, you know?

14:42.298 --> 14:45.065
I should've believed her.

14:45.100 --> 14:47.230
We've had weird fans,
and peeping toms before.

14:47.265 --> 14:49.329
You and Colleen have fans?

14:49.364 --> 14:51.395
We have a series
of graphic novels.

14:51.430 --> 14:53.296
I write, and she illustrates.

14:55.298 --> 14:57.791
We're mostly successful
because of her drawings.

15:02.760 --> 15:05.296
I mean, pretty convenient,
his wife having a stalker.

15:05.331 --> 15:07.329
Yeah, he didn't report it.

15:07.364 --> 15:08.956
Oh, he didn't believe her.
He says.

15:08.991 --> 15:10.725
Hmm.

15:10.760 --> 15:12.131
But a stalker doesn't explain
week-old bruises

15:12.166 --> 15:15.164
from "going on walks."
- Look at this.

15:15.199 --> 15:18.263
Colleen also had an illustrated
blog based on her life.

15:18.298 --> 15:20.230
Ah, she's a good artist.

15:20.265 --> 15:23.461
Look, the face looks
just like Marcus.

15:23.496 --> 15:24.989
I wonder if all
the characters are based

15:25.024 --> 15:27.098
on people she knows.

15:27.133 --> 15:29.263
It's possible.

15:33.331 --> 15:36.527
- Wait, look at that.
- Yeah.

15:36.562 --> 15:38.296
When did she start drawing
this character?

15:38.331 --> 15:39.329
Oh...

15:41.496 --> 15:43.329
Hmm.

15:43.364 --> 15:45.362
Since 11 days ago.

15:45.397 --> 15:47.060
Could that be the stalker?

15:50.133 --> 15:52.032
The tissue is intact.

15:52.067 --> 15:54.461
She didn't bleed out
from her knee scars.

15:54.496 --> 15:56.296
Then I can't find the source
of the exsanguination.

15:57.562 --> 16:00.824
There are no other wounds
that I can see.

16:00.859 --> 16:03.098
Except these tiny holes
in her feet and ankles.

16:05.199 --> 16:07.296
- Cuts? Burns?
- Holes.

16:07.331 --> 16:09.197
Nails?

16:09.232 --> 16:10.999
Torture?

16:12.397 --> 16:14.494
What about the bird spikes
on the bridge?

16:14.529 --> 16:16.527
The only other wounds
on this woman

16:16.562 --> 16:18.494
are from tiny bird spikes?

16:18.529 --> 16:20.362
There's one right over
her saphenous vein.

16:21.595 --> 16:23.560
Hmm... blood would clot
before a person bled out

16:23.595 --> 16:25.296
from a hole this small.

16:25.331 --> 16:27.395
Unless she has a clotting
disorder.

16:28.430 --> 16:30.362
Check for hemophilia,
leukemia,

16:30.397 --> 16:32.329
even scurvy.

16:32.364 --> 16:34.164
Tox screen is back.

16:34.199 --> 16:36.164
She was on blood thinners.

16:36.199 --> 16:38.263
Explains the bruising
of different ages.

16:38.298 --> 16:40.164
And the fact that she lost
enough blood to perish

16:40.199 --> 16:42.032
from a tiny hole
in her saphenous vein.

16:42.067 --> 16:44.362
Fantastic work.

16:44.397 --> 16:47.329
Now we can call
Detective Donovan McAvoy.

16:48.397 --> 16:50.395
He's one of the good ones.

16:50.430 --> 16:53.032
He and Dr. Cooper
make a really good team.

16:54.265 --> 16:56.362
Ah, the mysterious
Dr. Cooper.

17:01.595 --> 17:03.362
Hey, Marcus.

17:03.397 --> 17:05.263
Are those the blood thinners?

17:05.298 --> 17:07.164
She had varicose veins.
She'd hate you knowing that.

17:08.166 --> 17:10.230
She was embarrassed.

17:10.265 --> 17:12.230
Did you know your wife
was drawing this in her blog?

17:12.265 --> 17:14.197
A creepy guy in a fedora hat?

17:14.232 --> 17:16.197
No, but that blog
was Colleen's diary.

17:16.232 --> 17:18.032
She's helping us solve
her death.

17:19.463 --> 17:21.494
Dr. Thompson,
we've got the prescription,

17:21.529 --> 17:23.428
we'll bring it in.
- Not necessary, Detective,

17:23.463 --> 17:25.560
just read me the precise
dosage.

17:25.595 --> 17:27.527
It says 10 milligrams
of warfarin, twice a day.

17:27.562 --> 17:29.230
That's a high dosage.

17:29.265 --> 17:31.098
How long has she been on them?

17:31.133 --> 17:32.494
11 days.

17:32.529 --> 17:34.329
Colleen started drawing
the stalker in her blog

17:34.364 --> 17:35.397
about 11 days ago.

17:35.432 --> 17:37.494
<i>Was she hallucinating
the stalkers?</i>

17:37.529 --> 17:39.395
I'm not Google, McAvoy.

17:39.430 --> 17:42.065
Ask her doctor
or the pharmacist.

17:45.397 --> 17:48.263
Marcus, is this pharmacy
open on Sundays?

17:48.298 --> 17:50.230
They're open tomorrow
at 8 A.M..

17:50.265 --> 17:52.296
Why?

17:52.331 --> 17:54.065
No, it's all good.
All right.

17:54.100 --> 17:57.428
We'll be in touch,
thanks, Marcus.

17:57.463 --> 18:00.164
Ah, this new coroner's really
making me miss Jenny.

18:00.199 --> 18:01.626
Any idea when she's back?

18:01.661 --> 18:03.461
The last time I talked
to her,

18:03.496 --> 18:05.263
she was making it all
sound pretty peaceful.

18:05.298 --> 18:07.428
No, Jenny Cooper's not going
to stop being a coroner, man.

18:07.463 --> 18:09.098
I think she's just scared
to jump back in

18:09.133 --> 18:10.461
after what happened.

18:10.496 --> 18:12.461
Then she ought to take
a page out of your book,

18:12.496 --> 18:14.428
'cause... cannon ball!

18:14.463 --> 18:16.494
You're solid, man.

18:16.529 --> 18:18.065
Wow.

18:18.100 --> 18:19.626
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:19.661 --> 18:21.296
What's up? You all right?

18:21.331 --> 18:23.428
Yeah, I'm okay, I just, uh...

18:26.661 --> 18:28.230
What is that?

18:28.265 --> 18:30.494
Oh, it's a protective charm.
Why?

18:30.529 --> 18:31.956
Do you know anybody else
that has one?

18:31.991 --> 18:33.461
Um... George.

18:35.199 --> 18:37.065
Oh. Shoot.

18:37.100 --> 18:38.296
Um...

18:40.298 --> 18:42.263
Tyler, there was a,
there was a body

18:42.298 --> 18:43.890
that was found on your property
this morning.

18:43.925 --> 18:45.494
Did you know about that?

18:45.529 --> 18:47.461
- Okay, whoa.
- Look, we don't know--

18:47.496 --> 18:49.329
What? It's okay.

18:51.331 --> 18:53.296
We knew about the land, I
should've rigged out the land.

18:53.331 --> 18:55.164
- What?
- We-we knew this was coming.

18:55.199 --> 18:56.626
The-the birds...
- Hey, Tyler.

18:56.661 --> 18:58.626
the birds have been talking
about it for years.

18:58.661 --> 19:00.593
- Tyler? Hey.
- I should've known.

19:02.529 --> 19:04.296
They're here.
- It's okay.

19:04.331 --> 19:05.659
They're here!

19:05.694 --> 19:08.593
Hey, hey! Hey, Hayley?
- It's okay.

19:08.628 --> 19:10.461
- Hey.
- Hayley?

19:10.496 --> 19:11.692
Hayley!
- Hey.

19:11.727 --> 19:13.461
- Tyler.
- Hayley!

19:13.496 --> 19:15.428
- No, it's okay.
- Hayley, get the gun.

19:15.463 --> 19:16.396
- Whoa, hey, Tyler!
- Hayley! Hayley!

19:16.431 --> 19:18.527
What's going on?

19:18.562 --> 19:20.428
- Whoa-whoa-whoa!
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

19:20.463 --> 19:22.428
He doesn't have a gun!
Hey! Tyler, get inside.

19:22.463 --> 19:24.329
Tyler, come out with
your hands up!

19:24.364 --> 19:26.296
- What is going on?
- That is between us and Tyler.

19:26.331 --> 19:28.296
- Hey, where's the gun?
- You don't have a gun, Tyler!

19:28.331 --> 19:30.296
He doesn't have a gun, Jenny!
- So what, he's lost his mind?!

19:30.331 --> 19:32.296
- Stop! Stop! Hey!
- Where's the gun?

19:32.331 --> 19:34.098
- Go inside, Sweetie.
- Has this happened before?

19:34.133 --> 19:35.659
- Yes.
- Okay,

19:35.694 --> 19:37.296
is this part of the traumatic
brain injury?

19:37.331 --> 19:39.329
- Yeah.
- All right, he is in crisis.

19:39.364 --> 19:41.296
I'm the coroner for Ontario
West, you need a mental health

19:41.331 --> 19:43.263
specialist down here
immediately.

19:43.298 --> 19:45.527
- We don't have one of those.
- Okay, then just...

19:45.562 --> 19:47.494
will he talk to me?

19:49.463 --> 19:51.263
- Yeah.
- Okay.

19:51.298 --> 19:53.494
Okay?
- Fine. Five minutes.

19:58.265 --> 19:59.692
Ah! Ah!
Check!

19:59.727 --> 20:01.692
Check to see if they're
livestreaming this,

20:01.727 --> 20:03.692
giving up our positions, check.
- Hey, Tyler?

20:03.727 --> 20:05.659
Tyler.
- Check and make sure. Ahhh!

20:05.694 --> 20:07.692
Hey, I can't-I can't hear!
I can't hear. Check! Check!

20:07.727 --> 20:09.461
You said this isn't the first
time that this has happened?

20:09.496 --> 20:11.362
No, uh, when he was still
fighting pro,

20:11.397 --> 20:13.263
he got an illegal kick
to the head.

20:13.298 --> 20:15.098
It's why we moved out here,
we got away from the city.

20:15.133 --> 20:17.296
The stress triggers mania,
and post-traumatic delusions.

20:17.331 --> 20:20.164
I-I can't! I-I can't.

20:20.199 --> 20:22.560
The webcam scans my retinas.
I can't.

20:22.595 --> 20:24.461
It's just your traumatic
brain injury talking, Babe.

20:24.496 --> 20:26.461
I don't know how to help him.

20:26.496 --> 20:28.626
It's okay, you're doing
everything right, okay?

20:28.661 --> 20:30.527
Just stay patient, and loving.

20:30.562 --> 20:32.725
Hey, can I?

20:32.760 --> 20:34.527
Okay.

20:34.562 --> 20:36.999
Hey, hi.

20:38.024 --> 20:39.999
Hi.
- It was my job.

20:42.661 --> 20:46.197
It was my job
to keep George safe

20:46.232 --> 20:48.098
from the wrestling team.
And-and...

20:48.133 --> 20:49.725
George?
What are you talking about?

20:49.760 --> 20:51.692
Which wrestling team?

20:51.727 --> 20:55.098
Tyler? Hey.
You remember this morning,

20:55.133 --> 20:57.032
you were talking about
seeing George, right?

20:57.067 --> 20:58.428
When was the last time
you saw him?

21:01.298 --> 21:02.692
They're gonna throw me
in the death camps.

21:02.727 --> 21:04.560
No, Sweetie.

21:04.595 --> 21:06.296
They've got them all over the
country, all over the country.

21:06.331 --> 21:07.758
Okay, Tyler.

21:07.793 --> 21:09.692
He-he can't talk
to the police like this,

21:09.727 --> 21:11.494
he sounds crazy.

21:11.529 --> 21:13.164
I'm not leaving him alone
with them, he is in crisis!

21:13.199 --> 21:15.560
He is a Black man in crisis.

21:15.595 --> 21:17.197
Do you understand?

21:17.232 --> 21:18.593
Yeah.

21:20.100 --> 21:21.725
<i>Yeah, Hayley, I understand.</i>

21:21.760 --> 21:24.527
Okay. We're just gonna do
this together.

21:24.562 --> 21:27.527
Okay? We're gonna do this
together.

21:27.562 --> 21:29.758
<i>All right, all right.</i>

21:29.793 --> 21:31.527
I'll talk to them.

21:35.265 --> 21:37.296
So, coroner for Ontario West,
why didn't you say

21:37.331 --> 21:39.395
something sooner?
- Because I'm on vacation.

21:39.430 --> 21:41.230
Anyone can make an ID
like that look real.

21:41.265 --> 21:43.230
Tyler?

21:43.265 --> 21:45.626
What did you do to my son?!
- Mike, he didn't do anything!

21:45.661 --> 21:48.296
Hey, Mike, go home,
I will deal with you later.

21:49.661 --> 21:52.197
Feet in, Tyler, let's go.

21:52.232 --> 21:54.065
- Are you arresting him?
- Look--

21:54.100 --> 21:55.692
Arresting him?
He was George's friend!

21:55.727 --> 21:58.164
You hired Tyler to hang out
with George.

21:58.199 --> 21:59.791
We hired him to teach
him to fight!

21:59.826 --> 22:02.197
He didn't want to fight.

22:02.232 --> 22:04.164
You never understood your kid,
and Tyler did!

22:04.199 --> 22:05.593
- Tyler's a freak!
- Hey! Hey.

22:05.628 --> 22:08.428
He killed my son!
- Hey, Hayley, Hayley.

22:08.463 --> 22:10.593
Hayley, please.
- Tyler, I am right behind you!

22:10.628 --> 22:12.395
You are being watched.

22:12.430 --> 22:14.098
If anything happens to him
in custody,

22:14.133 --> 22:15.692
I will have your badge.

22:18.199 --> 22:20.197
Get him out of here.

22:20.232 --> 22:22.560
Mary, Mike,
I will come to you.

22:22.595 --> 22:24.263
Okay?

22:24.298 --> 22:26.230
Come on.

22:30.265 --> 22:32.164
Well, this doesn't look
great,

22:32.199 --> 22:34.296
attempting to conceal the body
on his property.

22:34.331 --> 22:35.725
Conceal?
It wasn't even hidden.

22:35.760 --> 22:38.560
Oh yeah, so he's no Easter
Bunny. But in my experience,

22:38.595 --> 22:40.527
that's not how a person acts
when they are innocent.

22:40.562 --> 22:42.560
He was absolutely calm
this morning when I saw him.

22:44.166 --> 22:45.659
What was the time of death?

22:45.694 --> 22:47.527
I don't have that
information.

22:47.562 --> 22:49.131
- Cause of death?
- Nope.

22:49.166 --> 22:50.857
What information do you have?

22:50.892 --> 22:52.527
Enjoy your vacation.

22:56.562 --> 22:58.065
I want to see the body.

23:02.595 --> 23:05.164
Someone carved the word
"evolve" into his leg,

23:05.199 --> 23:07.164
but the "l" looks like
an old scar.

23:07.199 --> 23:09.164
At least a year old.

23:09.199 --> 23:10.824
Tyler says he was supposed
to protect George

23:10.859 --> 23:12.791
from some wrestlers?

23:12.826 --> 23:15.362
Yeah, George's dad had him
join the school wrestling team.

23:15.397 --> 23:17.560
Maybe his teammates
roughed him up.

23:17.595 --> 23:19.395
And by "roughed him up"
you mean, carved the letter "l"

23:19.430 --> 23:22.428
in his leg?
- Boys will be boys.

23:22.463 --> 23:24.494
Mutilating someone
permanently falls under

23:24.529 --> 23:26.593
"boys will be boys"
in this town?

23:26.628 --> 23:28.428
Maybe they finished the job?

23:28.463 --> 23:30.626
I know these kids,
they're not killers.

23:30.661 --> 23:32.527
Well, don't let me get in the
way of your confirmation bias,

23:32.562 --> 23:33.791
but maybe--

23:33.826 --> 23:35.725
Oh, eat another liberal
popsicle, Dr. Cooper.

23:35.760 --> 23:37.791
We don't do that.

23:37.826 --> 23:40.230
Dr. Harrison, I don't believe
that he drowned.

23:40.265 --> 23:42.263
I think he was moved.

23:42.298 --> 23:43.857
Usually when you find a body
on its back in the water,

23:43.892 --> 23:46.890
it's because he was put there
posthumously.

23:46.925 --> 23:48.692
Not much in the way
of lividity.

23:48.727 --> 23:50.494
Well, whoever cut his leg
nicked his femoral artery.

23:50.529 --> 23:52.428
He bled out.

23:52.463 --> 23:54.626
It would've been a...
a painful death.

23:54.661 --> 23:57.131
We need evidence that leads
to the original crime scene.

23:57.166 --> 23:59.560
Well, carpet fibers,
car upholstery, soil--

23:59.595 --> 24:01.461
All that would've washed off
in the slough.

24:01.496 --> 24:03.494
Well, have you looked
in his nose or his mouth yet?

24:03.529 --> 24:05.626
Because that can tell us where
he took his last breath.

24:11.199 --> 24:13.329
What is that,
mucus?

24:13.364 --> 24:14.857
It's pollen.

24:14.892 --> 24:16.626
I have a palynology
colleague at Trent

24:16.661 --> 24:18.197
that can get on it right away.

25:17.727 --> 25:20.164
Okay, George.

25:23.562 --> 25:24.923
No, he didn't drown.

25:26.562 --> 25:28.395
Body moved.

25:28.430 --> 25:29.725
The pollen...

25:31.331 --> 25:32.692
is pending.

25:32.727 --> 25:34.725
"L..."

25:34.760 --> 25:37.593
is for "loser."

25:37.628 --> 25:39.527
And wrestling team.

25:46.331 --> 25:47.626
I need a body chart.

25:47.661 --> 25:49.659
Just...

26:36.760 --> 26:38.560
- Liam!
- Yes?

26:38.595 --> 26:39.923
Yeah. Hey.

26:39.958 --> 26:41.758
- Hey.
- I'm not going anywhere.

27:02.463 --> 27:04.560
No, just-just breathe.

27:08.760 --> 27:10.626
Okay. Yes. Breathe.

27:38.958 --> 27:40.857
Any pain?

27:40.892 --> 27:42.692
- No.
- But you can feel it?

27:42.727 --> 27:44.560
Yeah, I can feel it.

27:46.991 --> 27:48.725
Well, the hole in your spine
is gone.

27:48.760 --> 27:50.725
It healed beautifully.

27:51.826 --> 27:55.758
- And my cancer?
- In remission.

27:56.958 --> 27:58.494
So that's it?

28:00.562 --> 28:02.626
Well, we'll check on you
every year, but, yeah.

28:02.661 --> 28:04.098
That's it.

28:05.925 --> 28:08.065
Is there anything I should...
take? Uh, do?

28:10.925 --> 28:12.824
Well, you know, don't smoke.

28:12.859 --> 28:15.494
Wash fruit.

28:16.694 --> 28:19.032
So-so you're giving me
a clean bill of health?

28:19.067 --> 28:20.824
I mean, we don't actually
give those out, but that--

28:20.859 --> 28:22.989
But my spine, it--

28:23.024 --> 28:25.032
You're saying it's as good as
new?

28:25.067 --> 28:26.999
We don't often see this kind
of recovery, Donovan.

28:28.397 --> 28:30.032
You're an exception.

28:30.067 --> 28:32.098
So get your clothes on,
and get outta here.

28:32.133 --> 28:34.131
You've officially escaped
death.

28:34.166 --> 28:35.725
Thanks, Doc.

28:49.694 --> 28:51.032
Hey, I'm Detective Abed,

28:51.067 --> 28:52.989
this is Detective McAvoy.

28:53.024 --> 28:54.857
We have questions about a
prescription you filled out

28:54.892 --> 28:56.791
for warfarin for Colleen Hough?

29:00.133 --> 29:01.890
This is Colleen's
prescription, yes.

29:01.925 --> 29:04.857
And that's your name
on the label?

29:04.892 --> 29:07.560
Appears so, yes,
I'm Ben Hammond.

29:07.595 --> 29:09.065
We'd like to see
the original prescription.

29:15.694 --> 29:19.164
Uh... doctor's prescription
is for 2.5 milligrams.

29:19.199 --> 29:21.494
One pill twice daily.

29:21.529 --> 29:23.461
Colleen's bottle
says 10 milligrams.

29:24.760 --> 29:26.659
Hmm.

29:26.694 --> 29:28.362
Must be a mistake.

29:29.562 --> 29:31.527
You gave Colleen four times
the blood thinners

29:31.562 --> 29:32.956
she was prescribed.

29:44.430 --> 29:45.956
Is that your hat?

29:45.991 --> 29:47.989
And overcoat?

29:48.024 --> 29:50.032
Have you been following
Colleen?

29:50.067 --> 29:51.824
You're the one she's been
drawing, you knew.

29:51.859 --> 29:53.824
I-I just needed
the prescription back.

29:53.859 --> 29:55.758
So call her!

29:55.793 --> 29:57.032
I couldn't risk a record
of the call.

29:57.067 --> 29:59.692
If she-she sued,
I'd have been ruined.

29:59.727 --> 30:01.461
This wasn't your first
mistake.

30:01.496 --> 30:03.890
- You killed my wife!
- Whoa, hey!

30:03.925 --> 30:05.494
Put the gun down!
- Stay where you are!

30:05.529 --> 30:06.956
Put the gun down!

30:06.991 --> 30:09.164
No, no, I just saw her
outside walking, and I--

30:09.199 --> 30:12.560
You killed her!
You killed my wife!

30:12.595 --> 30:14.032
Drop the weapon, Marcus!

30:14.067 --> 30:16.164
She's dead?

30:16.199 --> 30:17.956
Marcus, lower the weapon!

30:17.991 --> 30:19.923
Mac, Mac! I got a shot.

30:19.958 --> 30:21.890
Nobody's getting shot here
today, all right?

30:22.892 --> 30:25.626
Marcus. Marcus!

30:25.661 --> 30:27.593
You're going to get justice.

30:27.628 --> 30:30.098
Justice?

30:30.133 --> 30:32.164
I want my wife back.

30:32.199 --> 30:34.494
He's pointing a gun at me!
Help me!

30:34.529 --> 30:35.758
Marcus, look at me,
don't listen to him.

30:35.793 --> 30:37.923
Why did you kill her?

30:37.958 --> 30:39.857
I didn't!
I tried to help her!

30:41.661 --> 30:43.791
But she-she was so angry,

30:43.826 --> 30:46.692
so-so I grabbed her
just to explain,

30:46.727 --> 30:48.164
but she struggled away,

30:48.199 --> 30:50.692
she-it was out of control!

30:50.727 --> 30:53.956
You let my wife bleed
onto the street

30:53.991 --> 30:56.065
until she was dead!
- No, no, please!

30:56.100 --> 30:58.791
Pharmacy is closed!

30:58.826 --> 31:00.758
Get out!
Malik! Stay put.

31:00.793 --> 31:02.560
<i>Hey, hey, hey, hey!</i>

31:03.727 --> 31:05.164
Point the gun at me, Marcus.

31:05.199 --> 31:07.098
Mac?
- Stay where you are.

31:07.133 --> 31:08.956
I'll shoot you!

31:08.991 --> 31:11.065
I'd do it.

31:11.100 --> 31:12.857
Come on,
what are you doing?

31:14.166 --> 31:16.032
Mac?

31:17.727 --> 31:19.659
Pull the trigger.

31:20.727 --> 31:22.164
Pull it!

31:22.199 --> 31:23.791
Mac?

31:25.232 --> 31:27.857
You think you can kill me?

31:27.892 --> 31:29.824
Nobody gets the jump on me,
I'm the superhero.

31:30.958 --> 31:33.098
I survived cancer,
a hole in my spine,

31:33.133 --> 31:34.923
getting attacked by a murderer,
for this?

31:40.232 --> 31:42.065
You think you can
take me down, huh?

31:44.133 --> 31:45.890
Go ahead!
There's a reason I'm back.

31:47.859 --> 31:49.791
Can you say the same thing?

31:58.529 --> 32:00.659
That's it.

32:07.859 --> 32:09.659
- You all right, man?
- Yeah.

32:22.859 --> 32:24.560
They won't release
Tyler.

32:27.331 --> 32:28.956
(Footsteps thud),

32:31.793 --> 32:33.593
Hey, what's the deal
with uh,

32:33.628 --> 32:35.890
George's parents and Tyler?

32:35.925 --> 32:37.230
When we bought the store
a year ago,

32:37.265 --> 32:39.791
they found out that Tyler
was a pro MMA fighter,

32:39.826 --> 32:41.593
and they wanted him
to train George.

32:41.628 --> 32:43.890
But George had zero interest
in fighting.

32:44.925 --> 32:47.131
Unless it was with
a half-orc druid,

32:47.166 --> 32:49.824
in a really good
"Dragon and Lair's" roll.

32:51.133 --> 32:53.758
Tyler got George into gaming.

32:53.793 --> 32:56.065
Well, it was more than just
games.

32:56.100 --> 32:58.032
Tyler's a part of this online
survivor group,

32:58.067 --> 33:00.890
he thought it would be a good
way for George to deal

33:00.925 --> 33:02.857
with the kids
who were bullying him.

33:02.892 --> 33:04.131
Oh yeah, those are the kids
that carved the "l"

33:04.166 --> 33:06.230
into his leg.

33:06.265 --> 33:08.131
"L" for "loser."

33:08.166 --> 33:10.065
Imagine.

33:10.100 --> 33:12.131
Poor George had to look
at that scar every day.

33:13.661 --> 33:15.626
Those kids come in here
sometimes, and I just...

33:15.661 --> 33:17.197
I want to toss them out.

33:17.232 --> 33:19.824
Did those kids ever
buy one of these?

33:21.694 --> 33:23.164
No, not that I can remember.

33:27.826 --> 33:29.758
Hi, you got it? All right.

33:31.067 --> 33:32.791
Hey.

33:33.991 --> 33:36.263
You know I had that situation,
right?

33:36.298 --> 33:37.989
Yeah, first week back,
and you point a guy's gun

33:38.024 --> 33:39.659
to your own head
and start screaming

33:39.694 --> 33:41.065
about being a superhero,

33:41.100 --> 33:42.923
you had that, Mac?

33:42.958 --> 33:44.956
I was speaking his language.

33:44.991 --> 33:46.923
And nobody got hurt,
it was good.

33:46.958 --> 33:48.857
You good?

33:48.892 --> 33:51.263
I'm-I'm good.
Yeah, don't I look good?

34:34.991 --> 34:37.230
Daisies, coneflowers,
and peonies.

34:40.661 --> 34:42.230
Hi, I'm uh, I'm Jenny Cooper.

34:42.265 --> 34:44.197
The coroner.

34:44.232 --> 34:46.098
Yeah, I was wondering
if I could uh...

34:46.133 --> 34:47.956
talk to you about George?

34:47.991 --> 34:49.791
Hello. Mike,
why don't you sit out here?

34:55.991 --> 34:58.362
I'll get us some tea.
- Thank you.

35:00.859 --> 35:03.725
Uh, you want a medical
history, or...?

35:03.760 --> 35:05.296
Oh, um,

35:05.331 --> 35:07.131
I was actually interested
in finding out

35:07.166 --> 35:09.890
some information about the boys
who assaulted your son.

35:09.925 --> 35:11.659
I'm hoping you could give me
some names.

35:11.694 --> 35:13.824
Well, his body wasn't
on their property.

35:13.859 --> 35:15.725
Yeah, I understand,
I'm just, I'm looking--

35:15.760 --> 35:18.263
I hired Tyler...

35:18.298 --> 35:20.362
to teach George to be a man,

35:20.397 --> 35:22.692
to-to fit in with his friends.

35:24.298 --> 35:27.296
But after he started hanging
around that weirdo,

35:27.331 --> 35:30.923
he started talking in some
video game language,

35:32.133 --> 35:34.659
spending hours at that store.

35:34.694 --> 35:37.065
Addicted to role playing games.

35:37.100 --> 35:38.857
Here we go.

35:38.892 --> 35:41.164
Would you like coffee
or tea, Dr. Cooper?

35:41.199 --> 35:43.131
- Um...
- City people!

35:43.166 --> 35:45.362
Corrupting my son's brain

35:45.397 --> 35:47.362
with their violent games!

35:47.397 --> 35:49.428
Those are beautiful flowers.

35:49.463 --> 35:51.332
Peonies, daisies,
all from my garden.

35:54.397 --> 35:56.263
Excuse me.

36:03.925 --> 36:06.296
Uh, wait!
Where are you going?

36:09.397 --> 36:11.329
No, she know--
Knows about where--

36:11.364 --> 36:13.758
What are you doing?!
Stop!

36:13.793 --> 36:15.989
There was pollen
in your son's nose.

36:18.991 --> 36:20.362
Don't.

36:29.331 --> 36:31.098
What are you doing?

36:53.760 --> 36:55.362
- This is where George died.
- Mary!

36:55.397 --> 36:57.329
We should've helped our son.

36:57.364 --> 36:59.329
- Well, I thought I was!
- No!

36:59.364 --> 37:02.164
He never wanted to be
a fighter!

37:02.199 --> 37:04.164
You made him.

37:04.199 --> 37:06.494
He was so sweet.

37:13.397 --> 37:15.461
He did it to himself.

37:17.298 --> 37:19.197
George carved "evolve"
into his own leg,

37:19.232 --> 37:21.527
and then let himself bleed out?
- He left a note.

37:23.859 --> 37:25.197
He left this.

37:34.067 --> 37:35.956
"See you on the next level?!"

37:35.991 --> 37:37.791
You moved his body
to Tyler's land.

37:37.826 --> 37:41.164
Tyler got him addicted
to video games!

37:41.199 --> 37:43.758
So you framed him for murder?

37:43.793 --> 37:45.098
I made it clear
what Tyler did.

37:46.298 --> 37:49.164
So everyone could see it!
Not just us!

38:09.232 --> 38:10.560
<i>Hey, it's Liam.</i>

38:10.595 --> 38:13.098
<i>Uh, I'm not here right now.
J'suis pas ici.</i>

38:13.133 --> 38:14.989
<i>Donc laisser un message.</i>

38:18.100 --> 38:19.494
I miss you.

38:21.595 --> 38:23.758
I'm living in a van.

38:25.595 --> 38:27.197
I don't know if you know that...

38:27.232 --> 38:29.527
already, but, you know.

38:30.595 --> 38:32.428
You would love it.

38:32.463 --> 38:34.461
It's right up your alley.

38:36.133 --> 38:37.527
I mean, I don't know
what you've done to me,

38:37.562 --> 38:40.461
I haven't gone on a vacation
in 12 years,

38:42.529 --> 38:45.197
and I end up in a...

38:45.232 --> 38:48.098
van in a field in the middle
of nowhere.

38:50.859 --> 38:52.956
I really came here
to avoid death, but...

38:54.199 --> 38:55.989
you know, in retrospect,

38:56.024 --> 38:57.395
it wasn't the most amazing
idea,

38:57.430 --> 38:59.395
because wherever you go,

38:59.430 --> 39:01.098
there you are, right?

39:03.133 --> 39:05.065
But I just drove until
I stopped.

39:10.133 --> 39:11.494
And we maybe...

39:13.925 --> 39:15.593
maybe it's some place
that we drove through,

39:15.628 --> 39:17.527
or maybe it just reminds me
of you.

39:19.232 --> 39:21.131
For how much time
we had together,

39:21.166 --> 39:23.098
I feel like I have so little
of you.

39:27.100 --> 39:29.527
I mean, this is the only place
that I can hear your voice.

39:30.925 --> 39:33.494
Because... because I can't hear
it in my head anymore,

39:36.024 --> 39:38.065
and that...

39:38.100 --> 39:39.923
and that scares me, because...

39:42.529 --> 39:45.065
because I don't wanna lose you.

39:47.496 --> 39:49.560
God, I'm so--

39:51.562 --> 39:53.824
Ah, I'm so sick
of losing people.

39:55.133 --> 39:57.560
If you can see me, just...

39:57.595 --> 39:59.395
you know, use a little
discretion.

39:59.430 --> 40:01.230
Only...

40:01.265 --> 40:03.428
you know, only look at me
when I'm cute, okay?

40:03.463 --> 40:05.494
Like, don't come and...

40:05.529 --> 40:07.395
look at me while
I'm in the shower, or...

40:11.067 --> 40:12.890
I'm totally kidding,
you can...

40:12.925 --> 40:15.032
you can absolutely look at me
in the shower.

40:19.595 --> 40:21.857
I love you.

40:25.232 --> 40:26.857
<i>If you're satisfied
with your message, press one.</i>

40:36.694 --> 40:38.395
- Can you believe him?
- Mmm!

40:40.232 --> 40:43.098
What are you doing?!

40:43.133 --> 40:44.626
Dr. Thompson bought those.

40:44.661 --> 40:46.296
So?!

40:46.331 --> 40:48.923
So? So, we're Team Jenny.

40:50.595 --> 40:52.329
After the day
we've had,

40:52.364 --> 40:54.362
I say we split the box!

40:55.694 --> 40:57.593
They do look delicious.

40:58.991 --> 41:00.626
So you want to eat these
at my place tonight, or yours?

41:02.199 --> 41:03.989
River, do you want
to move in together?

41:11.991 --> 41:13.626
Tyler!

41:14.991 --> 41:17.164
We picked up the members
of the wrestling team

41:17.199 --> 41:18.956
that were involved
in the incident with George.

41:18.991 --> 41:21.164
And?

41:21.199 --> 41:23.593
And we charged them
with assault.

41:23.628 --> 41:25.956
For what good it does,
I mean, they are minors.

41:27.958 --> 41:29.692
Sorry about that, Tyler.

41:29.727 --> 41:31.527
You'll keep your nose clean,
now, won't you?

41:31.562 --> 41:33.560
He has always kept
his nose clean.

41:38.166 --> 41:39.593
Right.

41:41.496 --> 41:42.956
We're so grateful to you.

41:42.991 --> 41:44.461
Of course.

42:04.199 --> 42:06.296
Ross, when you were little!

42:06.331 --> 42:08.461
- What did I say?
- Never mind.

42:08.496 --> 42:10.296
Oh, that's your Dad.

42:10.331 --> 42:13.098
You Dad was so handsome.

42:13.133 --> 42:15.164
And I missed this cute boy.

42:15.199 --> 42:16.560
Oh, somebody's here.

42:19.232 --> 42:21.032
Hey, it's-it's Mom!
She's home.

42:26.529 --> 42:28.131
Hi!

42:29.133 --> 42:30.758
Hi, guys.

42:30.793 --> 42:32.428
Hiya, Smiler.

42:32.463 --> 42:34.593
- You're home!
- Hi.

42:34.628 --> 42:36.527
And look, you're gardening,
too!

42:36.562 --> 42:38.758
Oh, I could help you put these--
- Oh, no, no.

42:38.793 --> 42:41.131
Ohh!

42:41.166 --> 42:42.989
- No Da--it's fine.
- Right.

42:43.024 --> 42:44.461
It's okay. Okay?

42:44.496 --> 42:46.428
It's fine.

42:49.694 --> 42:51.560
Okay, it's...

42:53.760 --> 42:55.626
yeah, that's...
