01:15.206 --> 01:16.970
Yeah, that's it.

02:17.970 --> 02:19.804
<i>I was out there on the road</i>

02:19.805 --> 02:21.873
<i>Life out of control</i>

02:21.874 --> 02:25.410
<i>She became a victim</i>
<i>to my busy schedule</i>

02:25.411 --> 02:26.978
<i>And I know that it's not fair</i>

02:26.979 --> 02:29.380
<i>That don't mean</i>
<i>that I don't care</i>

02:29.381 --> 02:32.817
<i>This one's dedicated</i>
<i>to the girl out there</i>

02:32.818 --> 02:35.287
- Okay. Good job.
- Thank you.

02:37.323 --> 02:38.991
No.

02:39.991 --> 02:42.991
If I shaved right now...

02:43.429 --> 02:44.762
Shave it.

02:44.763 --> 02:46.397
No, I'm not doing this, bro.

02:46.398 --> 02:48.566
But why the mustache?

02:48.567 --> 02:49.934
I wanna feel
I'm grown up, you know.

02:49.935 --> 02:52.436
There's a phase you go
through when you think

02:52.437 --> 02:54.705
that the mustache actually
looks good on you.

02:54.706 --> 02:56.706
But, um...

02:56.809 --> 02:59.543
It's delusional. It's just all...
It's all delusional.

02:59.544 --> 03:02.479
Basically this 'stache
is to make me think

03:02.480 --> 03:05.480
or feel a little bit older.

03:05.517 --> 03:08.853
See, when I can grow a full beard
like that, I'm gonna be rocking.

03:08.854 --> 03:11.389
But this right here,
it's coming.

03:13.592 --> 03:15.692
- So, um...
- You should slate this.

03:15.693 --> 03:16.693
Okay, let's slate it.

03:21.500 --> 03:24.335
<i>When you've reached</i>
<i>a certain point in your life,</i>

03:24.336 --> 03:28.708
<i>there are people out there</i>
<i>who sit waiting,</i>

03:29.708 --> 03:31.280
<i>wanting to see you fall.</i>

03:34.280 --> 03:37.848
<i>But rather than let gravity</i>
<i>take you down,</i>

03:37.849 --> 03:42.057
<i>sometimes you have to take
matters into your own hands...</i>

03:46.057 --> 03:47.492
<i>...and fly.</i>

05:22.553 --> 05:23.759
<i>Let's go!</i>

05:26.759 --> 05:28.428
<i>What's up, Miami?</i>

05:30.428 --> 05:33.097
<i>How you feeling tonight?</i>

05:33.098 --> 05:36.637
<i>If you're ready to believe,</i>
<i>let's make some noise.</i>

05:39.637 --> 05:42.974
<i>You're beautiful, beautiful</i>
<i>you should know it</i>

05:42.975 --> 05:46.710
<i>You're beautiful, beautiful</i>
<i>you should know it</i>

05:46.711 --> 05:48.746
<i>I think it's time</i>
<i>Think it's time</i>

05:48.747 --> 05:50.481
<i>That you show it</i>

05:50.482 --> 05:52.620
<i>You're beautiful, beautiful</i>

05:54.620 --> 05:57.754
<i>Baby, what you doin'?</i>
<i>Where you at, where you at?</i>

05:57.755 --> 06:01.426
<i>Why you actin' so shy?</i>
<i>Holdin' back, holdin' back</i>

06:01.427 --> 06:02.927
<i>We're not the only ones</i>

<i>Doin' it like that It like that</i>

06:04.829 --> 06:06.631
<i>So DJ bring that Bring that</i>

<i>You know I've been</i>
<i>all around the world, right?</i>

07:03.755 --> 07:07.624
<i>Well, tonight I wanna take you with me.
You ready?</i>

07:07.625 --> 07:08.760
<i>One, two...</i>

07:08.761 --> 07:13.266
<i>All around the world
People want to be loved</i>

07:14.266 --> 07:15.667
<i>Yeah</i>

<i>All around the world</i>

08:23.267 --> 08:24.807
You...

08:29.807 --> 08:30.941
<i>Beyond all the lights</i>

08:30.942 --> 08:35.145
<i>and, you know, the hype
and all the scrutiny</i>

08:35.147 --> 08:37.015
<i>and the pressure,</i>
<i>at the end of the day,</i>

08:38.015 --> 08:42.655
it comes down to a young man
in a room writing a song.

08:44.655 --> 08:46.157
I don't know about you...

08:46.158 --> 08:48.596
<i>That's where it all starts.</i>

08:50.596 --> 08:55.166
<i>And with Justin, it starts</i>
<i>with a pad of paper and a pen</i>

08:55.167 --> 08:57.868
<i>and a melody in his head that's
probably been there a very long time</i>

08:57.869 --> 08:59.938
<i>and he just needs to get it out.</i>

09:00.938 --> 09:02.773
<i>Music is his therapy.</i>

09:02.774 --> 09:04.812
<i>Music is his release.</i>

09:06.812 --> 09:08.112
<i>If I was your boyfriend...</i>

09:08.113 --> 09:09.312
<i>There?</i>

09:09.313 --> 09:11.983
<i>If I was your boyfriend</i>
<i>I'd never let you go</i>

09:11.984 --> 09:14.685
<i>I can take you places</i>
<i>you ain't never been before</i>

09:14.686 --> 09:16.854
<i>Baby, take a chance</i>
<i>or you'll never ever know</i>

09:16.855 --> 09:18.989
<i>I got money in my hands</i>
<i>that I'd really like to blow</i>

09:18.990 --> 09:21.258
<i>Swag, swag, on you</i>

09:21.259 --> 09:23.760
<i>Chillin' by the fire</i>
<i>while we eatin' fondue</i>

09:23.761 --> 09:26.162
<i>I don't know about me</i>
<i>but I know about you</i>

09:26.163 --> 09:28.302
<i>So say hello to falsetto</i>
<i>in three, two</i>

09:30.302 --> 09:31.835
<i>Let me hear that pass.</i>

09:31.836 --> 09:33.596
<i>If I was your boyfriend
I'd never let you go</i>

09:34.005 --> 09:35.406
I've known him
for four years now.

09:35.407 --> 09:38.308
And when I met him,
he was just a little kid.

09:38.309 --> 09:41.177
Yeah, man,
yeah, man, yeah. Ready?

09:41.178 --> 09:43.080
It'll look like I'm gonna die.
But I'm really not gonna die.

09:43.081 --> 09:44.083
Just watch.

09:47.186 --> 09:49.387
- I'm gonna do it again.
- No, no, no. You gotta shower.

09:49.388 --> 09:51.321
- Get in the shower.
- One more time.

09:51.322 --> 09:53.124
Here, you take this.
I gotta go do something.

09:53.125 --> 09:56.192
<i>It was just us, you know, in a
van going around the country.</i>

09:56.193 --> 09:58.829
<i>And really it started as me,</i>
<i>Ryan, Pattie and Justin.</i>

09:58.830 --> 10:00.198
- Last one. Go.
- Ready?

10:02.833 --> 10:04.167
Fantastic.

10:04.168 --> 10:06.771
<i>Then it went to
the</i> My World <i> tour.</i>

10:06.772 --> 10:10.874
And in that tour, he went
from being a kid on a stoop

10:10.875 --> 10:13.245
who sang on YouTube to being

10:14.245 --> 10:16.716
a worldwide arena veteran.

10:17.716 --> 10:22.787
<i>I'd like to be</i>
<i>everything you want</i>

10:22.788 --> 10:27.157
<i>Hey, girl, let me talk to you</i>

10:27.158 --> 10:32.296
Man, the trials of
being a teenager, period.

10:32.297 --> 10:35.700
I mean, it's tumultuous, but,
I mean, you just add on top

10:35.701 --> 10:40.171
<i>of being one of the most sought
after young icons of our time.</i>

10:40.172 --> 10:43.040
It's like a Pandora's Box.

10:43.041 --> 10:45.075
<i>Justin feels a lot of pressure,</i>

10:45.076 --> 10:49.846
a lot of unseen pressure,
to keep outdoing himself.

10:49.847 --> 10:52.416
<i>There's a lot of</i>
<i>expectation on him.</i>

10:52.417 --> 10:53.484
<i>You know, part of his childhood</i>

10:53.485 --> 10:55.885
was taken away from him
from working very early on,

10:55.886 --> 10:57.791
and, you know,
he's constantly being judged.

10:59.791 --> 11:02.326
<i>He's in a constant</i>
<i>search for validation</i>

11:02.327 --> 11:04.161
<i>'cause everyone's just waiting.</i>

11:04.162 --> 11:06.562
You know, they're constantly
just waiting for it to stop.

11:07.499 --> 11:09.800
<i>In a weird way</i>
<i>because of doubts,</i>

11:09.801 --> 11:11.561
<i>we keep finding ourselves</i>
<i>the underdog.</i>

11:21.779 --> 11:23.913
<i>Hey, what's the situation?</i>

11:23.914 --> 11:26.350
<i>Whoa</i>

11:26.351 --> 11:29.487
<i>I'm just trying to make
a little conversation</i>

11:29.488 --> 11:31.788
<i>Why the hesitation?</i>

11:31.789 --> 11:33.224
<i>Whoa</i>

11:33.225 --> 11:35.158
<i>Tell me what your name is</i>

11:35.159 --> 11:37.393
<i>For your information</i>

11:37.394 --> 11:39.062
<i>Don't get me wrong</i>

11:39.063 --> 11:41.197
<i>You know you're right</i>

11:41.198 --> 11:44.902
<i>Don't be so cold,
we could be fire</i>

11:44.903 --> 11:46.369
<i>Tomorrow we go</i>

11:46.370 --> 11:48.538
<i>Let's start tonight</i>

11:48.539 --> 11:51.010
<i>You know what it's all about</i>

11:53.010 --> 11:56.312
<i>I can take you out</i>
<i>I can take you home</i>

11:56.313 --> 12:00.283
<i>I can take you, oh...</i>
<i>Where you wanna go</i>

12:00.284 --> 12:04.053
<i>I can pick it up</i>
<i>We could take it slow</i>

12:04.054 --> 12:07.792
<i>I can take you home Oh, oh, oh</i>

12:07.793 --> 12:11.427
<i>I can take you out</i>
<i>I can take you home</i>

12:11.428 --> 12:15.132
<i>I can take you</i>
<i>Where you wanna go</i>

12:15.133 --> 12:19.069
<i>I can pick it up</i>
<i>We could take it slow</i>

12:19.070 --> 12:22.540
<i>I can take you home Oh, oh, oh</i>

12:22.541 --> 12:24.544
<i>I can take you out</i>

12:26.544 --> 12:28.381
<i>I can take you home</i>

12:30.381 --> 12:32.285
<i>I can get you out</i>

12:34.285 --> 12:37.990
<i>I can take you home Oh, oh, oh</i>

12:38.990 --> 12:41.392
<i>Baby, señorita, ma chérie</i>

12:41.393 --> 12:44.195
<i>Please be my little lady</i>

12:44.196 --> 12:46.864
<i>My little lady, yeah</i>

12:46.865 --> 12:49.099
<i>Mi amor, you're the one I adore</i>

12:49.100 --> 12:51.167
<i>Come on, be my little lady</i>

12:51.168 --> 12:53.303
<i>My little lady</i>

12:53.304 --> 12:55.172
<i>I can take you home</i>

12:55.173 --> 12:57.106
<i>I can take you home</i>

12:57.107 --> 13:00.945
<i>I can take you, oh...</i>
<i>Where you wanna go</i>

13:00.946 --> 13:04.849
<i>I can pick it up</i>
<i>We could take it slow</i>

13:04.850 --> 13:07.253
<i>I can take you home Oh, oh, oh</i>

13:11.956 --> 13:13.224
<i>The first time he told me</i>

13:13.225 --> 13:14.524
<i>that he wanted to</i>
<i>name the album</i> "Believe,"

13:14.525 --> 13:17.894
<i>he said, "I just want for</i>
<i>people to believe in me,</i>

13:17.895 --> 13:19.997
<i>"but at the same
time I want them to know</i>

13:19.998 --> 13:22.398
<i>"that they helped</i>
<i>get me here."</i>

13:22.399 --> 13:24.935
I've been supporting him
since day one.

13:24.936 --> 13:27.370
Ever since those videos
on YouTube before <i> One Time.</i>

13:27.371 --> 13:28.205
That was us.
We were the comments.

13:28.206 --> 13:30.407
I loved him from,
like, the beginning

13:30.408 --> 13:33.310
when he was making
videos on YouTube.

13:33.311 --> 13:35.512
And, oh, my gosh, I don't know.
He's just so amazing.

13:35.513 --> 13:37.047
He's so hot.

13:37.048 --> 13:38.382
The haters are just jealous.

13:38.383 --> 13:40.050
Yeah.
And they don't...

13:40.051 --> 13:42.119
I don't think... They just
don't understand his music.

13:42.120 --> 13:43.320
They don't.
Yeah, they just think,

13:43.321 --> 13:46.290
"Oh, it's Justin Bieber, he's
a guy, we can't like him."

13:46.291 --> 13:48.459
But, like, that's not it. He's
a musician, not just a guy.

13:48.460 --> 13:50.494
I thought he was cute last year,

13:50.495 --> 13:52.363
but, like, as I'm getting older

13:52.364 --> 13:54.665
and as he's getting older,
like, oh, my God,

13:54.666 --> 13:56.467
he's just getting
even more cuter every day.

14:02.374 --> 14:05.514
He's an idol for me
and really talented, so...

14:10.514 --> 14:12.554
- Pull up that acoustic for me, Brent.
- All right.

14:13.591 --> 14:15.351
<i>You know, we have</i>
<i>different relationships</i>

14:15.352 --> 14:16.954
<i>with different producers,</i>

14:16.955 --> 14:19.389
<i>the people that he goes in with
and sees if he vibes with.</i>

14:19.390 --> 14:23.226
<i>Mike Posner, Max Martin...</i>

14:23.227 --> 14:25.495
- <i> ...Will.i.am.</i>
- Can you feel it in this beat?

14:25.496 --> 14:27.263
Okay.
No, that's my heart, girl.

14:27.264 --> 14:29.264
<i>And Rodney Jerkins.</i>

14:35.139 --> 14:37.499
<i>Working with Justin, he'll
play me 20, 30 ideas and say,</i>

14:38.009 --> 14:41.244
"No, man, I got ideas. I got
ideas I gotta get out of me."

14:41.245 --> 14:43.279
And I thrive off of that
because that just shows me

14:43.280 --> 14:44.615
how much he loves music.

14:55.427 --> 14:57.628
You know, Rodney Jerkins,
that's like Michael Jackson,

14:57.629 --> 14:59.529
that's Mariah Carey.

14:59.530 --> 15:01.665
Like those are,
like, the top of the top.

15:01.666 --> 15:04.136
<i>Like, Rodney Jerkins,</i>
<i>he's a legend.</i>

15:06.136 --> 15:09.440
<i>They start working and
Rodney just has this beat.</i>

15:09.441 --> 15:12.347
<i>And he's hitting the drums</i>
<i>and he's hitting the piano.</i>

15:16.328 --> 15:18.648
<i>He's going back and forth</i>
<i>with the drums and the piano,</i>

15:18.649 --> 15:20.683
<i>and Justin's vibing out
and then Justin starts,</i>

15:20.684 --> 15:22.353
<i>"Can I try something?</i>
<i>Can I try something?"</i>

15:22.354 --> 15:24.357
<i>And Rodney's like,</i>
<i>"Go, go, go."</i>

15:29.894 --> 15:33.229
<i>And then Justin starts trying to
figure out hooks and melodies,</i>

15:33.230 --> 15:35.231
<i>and then Rodney's doing</i>
<i>his hooks and his melodies.</i>

15:35.232 --> 15:38.736
<i>And then it just kept growing
and growing and growing.</i>

16:40.764 --> 16:43.667
<i>We have a responsibility
to our journey.</i>

16:43.668 --> 16:44.835
<i>Even though</i>
<i>you're singing a song</i>

16:44.836 --> 16:47.638
<i>and it's about</i>
<i>your situation in your life,</i>

16:47.639 --> 16:49.572
<i>you're singing it for
everyone else to connect to.</i>

16:49.573 --> 16:52.075
So what you're
going through, tell it,

16:52.076 --> 16:53.777
tell the story,
make it come to life,

16:53.778 --> 16:55.745
<i>'cause that's what it's about.</i>

16:55.746 --> 16:58.415
Just take them
on this crazy journey.

16:58.416 --> 17:00.551
To get them second-guessing

17:00.552 --> 17:02.452
and be like, "I already know
how the song's gonna end,"

17:02.453 --> 17:04.421
then boom, you smack them in
the face with a Filet-O-Fish,

17:04.422 --> 17:05.788
you know what I'm saying,

17:05.789 --> 17:07.490
you get white stuff all up
the side of their head.

17:07.491 --> 17:09.326
So, like, that's what you wanna
do, you know what I'm saying,

17:09.327 --> 17:11.567
'cause they think you're hitting
them with French fries.

17:15.432 --> 17:17.733
A lot of times,
he kinda just starts rapping,

17:17.733 --> 17:19.803
and he'll just start rapping
his verses.

17:19.804 --> 17:21.571
And then the verses will
start coming onto the songs.

17:21.573 --> 17:23.640
<i>Take it slow, girl</i>

17:23.641 --> 17:25.675
<i>'Cause things get...</i>
<i>No, girl</i>

17:25.675 --> 17:29.246
<i>'Cause things get crazy
up on that road</i>

17:29.247 --> 17:32.281
<i>He'll get a track and then</i>
<i>he'll start getting an idea.</i>

17:32.282 --> 17:34.351
<i>He'll write down a little bit</i>
<i>or write it down on his phone</i>

17:34.352 --> 17:35.352
<i>in his notepad.</i>

17:35.353 --> 17:37.490
<i>Hey, you are the one thing</i>

17:39.490 --> 17:43.893
<i>It would be that I just...</i>

17:43.894 --> 17:45.529
And then go into, like...

17:47.632 --> 17:51.268
<i>I... I... I want,</i>
<i>want, want you, you, you</i>

17:51.269 --> 17:53.170
<i>And then he'll</i>
<i>go back on it again</i>

17:53.171 --> 17:54.851
<i>and he'll start putting
more words to it.</i>

17:58.576 --> 18:02.679
<i>I want you, you, you</i>

18:02.680 --> 18:06.583
<i>I want you, you, you</i>

18:06.584 --> 18:09.886
<i>I want you, you, you</i>

18:09.887 --> 18:11.191
Okay. I just...

18:17.194 --> 18:20.398
<i>Don't let it get in the way</i>

18:21.398 --> 18:23.269
<i>Let's take it easy</i>

18:24.269 --> 18:25.536
<i>Oh, oh</i>

18:25.537 --> 18:29.273
<i>Don't let it get in the way</i>

18:30.575 --> 18:32.776
You know, it just
naturally kinda happened.

18:32.777 --> 18:34.411
You know, the song
started flowing and...

18:34.412 --> 18:37.346
<i>And the kids have been waiting
for</i> Believe <i> for so long.</i>

18:37.347 --> 18:40.416
<i>We revved up the first single, and all
they know is the name is</i> "Boyfriend."

18:40.417 --> 18:42.486
- I can just guess how it goes.
- How does it go?

18:42.487 --> 18:44.421
<i>If I was your boyfriend...</i>

18:44.422 --> 18:45.354
That's exactly how it...

18:45.355 --> 18:46.489
<i>Never let you go</i>

18:46.490 --> 18:47.924
That's exactly how it goes.

18:47.925 --> 18:49.793
<i>Ever, ever, ever let you go</i>

18:49.794 --> 18:50.960
That's exactly...

18:50.961 --> 18:52.395
<i>Girl</i>

18:52.396 --> 18:53.896
How did you know that?

18:53.897 --> 18:55.737
I'm just guessing that
that's how it would go.

18:58.836 --> 19:00.938
<i>I worked on</i>
<i>the record</i> Boyfriend,

19:00.939 --> 19:03.507
<i>and originally</i>
<i>the song was gonna be called</i>

19:03.508 --> 19:07.710
<i>"Inside of Your Bedroom,"</i>
and I always hated that.

19:07.711 --> 19:11.781
<i>Then we were in the studio with
Justin and, like, really hit a wall.</i>

19:11.782 --> 19:13.850
Like, what can we say
instead of that?

19:13.851 --> 19:17.688
<i>Finally we came up with,
"If I was your boyfriend."</i>

19:17.689 --> 19:19.456
And I loved that.
I knew that was it.

19:19.457 --> 19:21.357
Let's do this!

19:21.358 --> 19:23.118
<i>And we're just in</i>
<i>full-on countdown mode.</i>

19:24.328 --> 19:29.432
<i>One day, 12 hours,</i>
<i>six hours, 30 minutes,</i>

19:29.433 --> 19:31.073
<i>seven, six, five, four,
three, two, one.</i>

19:32.002 --> 19:34.504
<i>If I was your boyfriend</i>
<i>I'd never let you go</i>

19:34.505 --> 19:36.940
<i>I can take you places</i>
<i>you ain't never been before</i>

19:36.941 --> 19:39.308
<i>Baby, take a chance</i>
<i>or you'll never ever know</i>

19:39.309 --> 19:41.545
<i>I got money in my hands</i>
<i>that I'd really like to blow</i>

19:41.546 --> 19:44.314
<i>Swag, swag, swag, on you</i>

19:44.315 --> 19:46.682
<i>Chillin' by the fire</i>
<i>while we eatin' fondue</i>

19:46.683 --> 19:48.951
<i>I don't know about me</i>
<i>but I know about you</i>

19:48.952 --> 19:50.487
<i>So say hello to falsetto</i>

19:50.488 --> 19:52.456
<i>In three, two...</i>

19:52.457 --> 19:57.326
<i>I'd like to be</i>
<i>everything you want</i>

19:57.327 --> 20:00.596
<i>Hey, girl, let me talk to you</i>

20:00.597 --> 20:05.335
<i>If I was your boyfriend
I'd never let you go</i>

20:05.336 --> 20:09.008
<i>Keep you on my arm, girl
You'd never be alone</i>

20:10.008 --> 20:12.576
<i>I can be a gentleman</i>

20:12.577 --> 20:14.745
- Your new song, that's pretty sexy.
- Oh, you like it?

20:14.746 --> 20:16.546
I tell everybody that you're
not the Biebs anymore, man,

20:16.547 --> 20:18.181
you are Mr. Bieber.

20:18.182 --> 20:21.050
<i>Tell me about picking</i> Boyfriend
<i>as your first single.</i>

20:21.051 --> 20:23.487
<i>I feel like every single that's
dropping is like this...</i>

20:23.488 --> 20:24.755
<i>Right, right.</i>

20:24.756 --> 20:26.190
<i>So I wanted to do</i>
<i>something a little different,</i>

20:26.191 --> 20:29.326
<i>slow it down, something a
little bit more mature.</i>

20:29.327 --> 20:32.762
When the faders are up and you
pull all that music down,

20:32.763 --> 20:34.964
and all you have is that vocal,

20:34.965 --> 20:39.635
if it's a hit then,
then it'll be a hit always.

20:39.636 --> 20:40.804
<i>People absolutely</i>
<i>love the record.</i>

20:40.805 --> 20:43.440
<i>It debuted number one
on the Billboard charts,</i>

20:43.441 --> 20:48.545
and everyone really received
how his voice had matured.

20:48.546 --> 20:49.912
<i>Let me talk to you</i>

20:49.913 --> 20:54.750
<i>If I was your boyfriend
I'd never let you go</i>

20:54.751 --> 20:59.823
<i>Keep you on my arm, girl
You'd never be alone</i>

20:59.824 --> 21:04.728
<i>I can be a gentleman</i>
<i>anything you want</i>

21:04.729 --> 21:08.400
<i>If I was your boyfriend
I'd never let you go</i>

21:09.400 --> 21:11.440
<i>Never let you go</i>

21:15.440 --> 21:16.477
<i>Yeah, girl</i>

21:19.477 --> 21:21.481
<i>If I was your boyfriend</i>

21:24.481 --> 21:26.683
<i>If I was your boyfriend</i>

21:33.458 --> 21:36.793
<i>There was so much talk about
what you were going to do next.</i>

21:36.794 --> 21:38.595
<i>I mean, everybody
in the music business,</i>

21:38.596 --> 21:41.897
<i>everybody in the world</i>
<i>had an opinion about it.</i>

21:41.898 --> 21:43.967
<i>Did you listen to all that?</i>

21:43.968 --> 21:45.402
<i>Did you shut the door and say,</i>

21:45.403 --> 21:46.636
<i>"You know what, I'm not
gonna hear any of them,</i>

21:46.637 --> 21:48.070
<i>"I'm just gonna focus</i>
<i>on what's inside of me?"</i>

21:48.071 --> 21:52.108
<i>I'm the only one who can
ultimately make those decisions</i>

21:52.109 --> 21:54.978
<i>because, like, I'm gonna have to live
with my career for the rest of my life,</i>

21:54.979 --> 21:56.579
<i>so I have to make</i>
<i>those decisions,</i>

21:56.580 --> 21:58.816
<i>where I want my career to go.</i>

22:05.923 --> 22:08.924
So she was sleeping and I was
waiting till, like 12:00 a.m.,

22:08.925 --> 22:11.661
like, for when it
was released on iTunes.

22:11.662 --> 22:13.662
And right when it was released,
I called her and I was like,

22:13.663 --> 22:15.598
"We have to buy it.
We have to buy it right now."

22:15.599 --> 22:17.033
So we bought it
and we just listened to it

22:17.034 --> 22:18.869
together on the phone,
like, the whole time.

22:22.640 --> 22:23.800
<i>Justin Bieber's album</i> Believe

22:24.008 --> 22:26.289
<i>scored the number one spot</i>
<i>on the Billboard 200 Chart,</i>

22:27.010 --> 22:30.852
<i>selling 374,000 copies</i>
<i>in the first week.</i>

22:34.852 --> 22:37.453
It was about making music
that was real to him,

22:37.454 --> 22:39.689
but that was also
real to the fans.

22:39.690 --> 22:41.691
You know, it had to
connect emotionally.

22:41.692 --> 22:42.826
We were on the phone together

22:42.827 --> 22:44.161
and we were both crying
listening to <i> Be Alright,</i>

22:44.162 --> 22:45.495
and we're like,
"This is the best song."

22:45.496 --> 22:46.695
Best song ever.

22:46.696 --> 22:48.030
<i>As Long As You Love Me,</i>
it's definitely the best.

22:48.031 --> 22:49.031
Yeah.

22:49.400 --> 22:51.840
<i>Thought of You,</i> I love that song.
That's a personal favorite.

23:02.145 --> 23:03.226
Oh, my God, that's his bus.

23:10.922 --> 23:14.825
<i>I'm psyched to play it on the radio.
This is a massive, monster hit.</i>

23:14.826 --> 23:16.126
<i>It feels good.</i>

23:16.127 --> 23:19.528
<i>Girl, I'm in love</i>
<i>with the thought of you</i>

23:19.529 --> 23:21.864
<i>The album was out.</i>
<i>It's number one.</i>

23:21.865 --> 23:25.634
But at the end of the day, Justin
wants to be known as an entertainer.

23:25.635 --> 23:27.871
<i>You wanna be one of those artists
that every generation waits</i>

23:27.872 --> 23:29.472
<i>for that concert
to come to town.</i>

23:29.473 --> 23:32.843
<i>And we needed someone that
Justin really trusted creatively</i>

23:32.844 --> 23:35.045
to direct our tour.

23:35.046 --> 23:37.213
<i>That person was</i>
<i>shooting a movie.</i>

23:37.214 --> 23:40.916
One morning I got a call
from Scooter, and he said,

23:40.917 --> 23:44.254
<i>"You know, last time you did a
little enhancement on his show.</i>

23:44.255 --> 23:47.056
"What if this time you got it
from the ground up

23:47.057 --> 23:48.525
"where there is
no show right now

23:48.526 --> 23:50.767
<i>"and you would work with
Justin to create the show?"</i>

23:51.028 --> 23:54.163
And we were going to force him

23:54.164 --> 23:56.165
<i>one way or another</i>
<i>to commit to us.</i>

23:56.166 --> 23:58.835
Justin called me and Scooter
kept calling me and...

23:58.836 --> 24:00.871
Me and Justin had a plan.

24:00.872 --> 24:02.605
And I said, "Hey, me and
Justin are over here,

24:02.606 --> 24:04.606
"we're hanging out,
come over and see us."

24:04.942 --> 24:07.043
I'm, I'm hanging out right now.

24:07.044 --> 24:09.181
And, I have my friend
Nick DeMoura here.

24:10.181 --> 24:11.280
Hello.

24:11.281 --> 24:14.084
And we have
a special announcement.

24:14.085 --> 24:17.287
Um, Tom is back,
our production manager.

24:17.288 --> 24:20.723
And, um, uh... Oh, oh,
this is Justin Bieber.

24:20.724 --> 24:23.159
What's up, everybody?
I'm Justin.

24:23.160 --> 24:26.162
And as soon as he got there, Justin
and I just completely cornered him.

24:26.163 --> 24:27.663
They said, "You're not
leaving this house

24:27.664 --> 24:29.900
"until you agree
to do this show."

24:29.901 --> 24:31.201
And, Justin, we have
a special announcement

24:31.202 --> 24:33.068
- about the <i> Believe</i> tour.
- What is it?

24:33.069 --> 24:34.630
Well, I think
someone's just joining on

24:35.006 --> 24:37.274
officially to come and help
us creatively direct it.

24:37.275 --> 24:38.575
No, really?

24:38.576 --> 24:39.709
Yeah, yeah,
to creatively direct it.

24:39.710 --> 24:41.177
- No. Who did?
- Who did what?

24:41.178 --> 24:43.279
- Why don't you sit down over there.
- Maybe it's Jon Chu.

24:43.280 --> 24:44.847
- Jonathan M. Chu.
- Hello.

24:44.848 --> 24:46.615
What's up, everybody?

24:46.616 --> 24:49.553
And then Justin was like, "So
are you in or are you not?"

24:49.554 --> 24:50.875
I said, "Well, I don't know yet.

24:51.021 --> 24:51.822
"I gotta figure out my schedule.

24:51.823 --> 24:53.856
"I gotta see
your guys' schedule."

24:53.857 --> 24:55.825
He's like, "Jon, you're not leaving
this until you say you're in."

24:55.826 --> 24:58.897
Jon has a problem
saying no to Justin.

25:00.897 --> 25:02.833
Oh, my God.

25:15.046 --> 25:17.949
Can I open this one now?

25:24.154 --> 25:26.154
What do you got?

25:26.757 --> 25:29.627
She's crying
with tears of joy, right?

25:30.627 --> 25:31.627
Let me see.

25:40.770 --> 25:42.875
Tears of joy.

25:44.875 --> 25:46.913
Oh, my God.

25:48.913 --> 25:50.380
Catherine, let me see.

25:50.381 --> 25:52.684
- Live Justin Bieber tickets.
- What is it?

26:05.162 --> 26:07.130
<i>Say you love me</i>

26:07.131 --> 26:10.366
<i>As much as I love you, yeah</i>

26:10.367 --> 26:13.636
<i>Would you hurt me, baby?</i>

26:13.637 --> 26:16.139
<i>Could you do that to me, yeah?</i>

26:16.140 --> 26:19.174
<i>Would you lie to me, baby?</i>

26:19.175 --> 26:21.745
<i>'Cause the truth hurts</i>
<i>so much more</i>

26:21.746 --> 26:24.016
<i>Would you do the things
that drive me crazy?</i>

26:25.016 --> 26:27.350
<i>Leave my heart</i>
<i>still at the door?</i>

26:27.351 --> 26:30.220
<i>Oh, I can't help it</i>
<i>I'm just selfish</i>

26:30.221 --> 26:33.222
<i>There's no way</i>
<i>that I could share you</i>

26:33.223 --> 26:35.858
<i>That would break</i>
<i>my heart to pieces</i>

26:35.859 --> 26:37.993
<i>Honestly the truth is</i>

26:37.994 --> 26:41.166
<i>If I could just die in your arms</i>

26:43.166 --> 26:46.302
<i>I wouldn't mind</i>

26:46.303 --> 26:48.938
<i>'Cause every time you touch me</i>

26:48.939 --> 26:53.910
<i>I just die in your arms</i>

26:53.911 --> 26:57.447
<i>Ooh, it feels so right</i>

26:57.448 --> 26:59.786
<i>So, baby, baby,
please don't stop, girl</i>

27:01.786 --> 27:03.390
<i>Music is
what brings us together.</i>

27:06.390 --> 27:09.959
<i>I can't tell you how many friends
I've made because of music.</i>

27:09.960 --> 27:12.394
<i>Oh, if there is a reason...</i>

27:12.395 --> 27:13.997
<i>Music is a universal language</i>

27:13.998 --> 27:16.432
that could describe
any moment in life.

27:16.433 --> 27:17.867
<i>I hear a certain song,</i>

27:17.868 --> 27:21.904
<i>it reminds me of my first
heartbreak, first love.</i>

27:21.905 --> 27:24.374
<i>As any human being,</i>
<i>you've heard a song</i>

27:24.375 --> 27:27.410
and it catches you
and it's a visceral reaction.

27:27.411 --> 27:29.879
<i>Your mind isn't doing
any work, but your gut,</i>

27:29.880 --> 27:32.147
<i>your heart, your soul,</i>
<i>whatever you wanna call it,</i>

27:32.148 --> 27:33.216
<i>it feels it.</i>

27:33.217 --> 27:35.019
<i>Oh, I can't help it</i>
<i>I'm just selfish</i>

27:36.019 --> 27:38.022
<i>There's no way</i>
<i>that I could share you</i>

27:39.022 --> 27:41.324
<i>That would break</i>
<i>my heart to pieces</i>

27:41.325 --> 27:43.826
<i>Honestly the truth is</i>

27:43.827 --> 27:45.347
<i>If I could just</i>
<i>die in your arms...</i>

27:46.029 --> 27:48.797
<i>I love music.</i>
<i>I love making music.</i>

27:48.798 --> 27:51.835
I like making music that
travels all around the world.

27:51.836 --> 27:54.470
<i>And people are all in</i>
<i>different countries,</i>

27:54.471 --> 27:57.774
<i>Mexico, London, France,
all over the world</i>

27:57.775 --> 27:59.342
<i>are singing the lyrics.</i>

27:59.343 --> 28:01.111
<i>They might not even</i>
<i>know how to speak English,</i>

28:01.112 --> 28:03.512
but they're singing
those lyrics.

28:03.513 --> 28:04.950
That's what it's about.

28:07.417 --> 28:11.295
<i>If I could die...</i>

28:23.366 --> 28:25.405
<i>Don't stop, baby, no</i>

28:29.405 --> 28:31.941
<i>It's what you do to me</i>

28:31.942 --> 28:34.980
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

28:48.057 --> 28:49.491
<i>Have you been in love?</i>

28:49.492 --> 28:51.995
Have I been...
Of course I've been in love.

28:51.996 --> 28:55.934
Um, I think being in love is
the most powerful thing ever.

28:57.934 --> 29:00.269
It's an extreme feeling,
being in love.

29:00.270 --> 29:02.173
Have you ever had heartbreak?

29:03.173 --> 29:06.075
Yes, yes, definitely.

29:06.076 --> 29:08.210
That's...

29:08.211 --> 29:11.017
That's even, I would say, it's
about just the same feeling.

29:13.017 --> 29:15.119
As much as it is
to fall in love,

29:16.119 --> 29:17.521
like, in that...

29:18.521 --> 29:21.156
It's that explosiveness,
that fire,

29:21.157 --> 29:24.962
just when you break up from that,
if you give them everything,

29:25.962 --> 29:28.099
and you break up
from that, you're...

29:30.099 --> 29:31.433
It's the same type...

29:31.434 --> 29:34.437
It's like that
clenching feeling like...

29:34.438 --> 29:36.439
Oh, like, when you...
This is my feeling.

29:36.440 --> 29:39.041
Like, "Oh, I love her
so much."

29:39.042 --> 29:42.614
But then that's the same feeling
when we break up, it's like,

29:43.614 --> 29:46.915
"Oh, like, this hurts.
This hurts so deep."

29:46.916 --> 29:49.854
It's just the same emotion,
but, uh, flipped backwards.

30:53.284 --> 30:56.552
<i>I'm here at Justin Bieber's
world tour audition.</i>

30:56.553 --> 30:57.987
<i>This is the first time</i>
<i>he's using girls,</i>

30:57.988 --> 31:03.258
so I feel pretty honored to hopefully
be one of the first to do that.

31:03.259 --> 31:08.564
<i>Over there are a bunch of lovely
ladies fighting for the gig.</i>

31:08.565 --> 31:11.366
<i>And there's limited spots,</i>
<i>so it's pretty nerve-racking</i>

31:11.367 --> 31:12.969
<i>standing next to a good friend</i>

31:12.970 --> 31:15.137
<i>and knowing that one of you may
make it, and one of you may not.</i>

31:15.138 --> 31:19.241
Move, cha, pa, boom, boom, hold!
Move, ba, da, da, hold.

31:19.242 --> 31:21.545
Pop, pop, shoo, pop, pop,
pop, pop, pop, hold.

31:30.954 --> 31:31.954
Let's go!

31:33.089 --> 31:34.723
Let's go!

31:34.724 --> 31:37.161
Five, six... Eight.

31:46.703 --> 31:48.570
Hold... Whoa!

31:48.571 --> 31:50.672
This is something that has
been itching on the inside.

31:50.673 --> 31:53.508
Like, I've never really
been on a tour before.

31:53.509 --> 31:56.412
And this would be
such a dream come true.

31:56.413 --> 31:58.480
<i>I'm getting older</i>
<i>and I feel like</i>

31:58.481 --> 31:59.449
<i>if there's one time to do it,</i>

31:59.450 --> 32:01.249
<i>if there's one moment to have,</i>

32:01.250 --> 32:02.652
it'd be this one here.

32:02.653 --> 32:04.454
Here we go.
Let's get cracking.

32:21.171 --> 32:24.151
Justin just came in. Yeah,
so no pressure, you know.

32:34.151 --> 32:36.751
I just was, like, so in there. I
was like, "I want this so bad."

32:41.325 --> 32:42.424
<i>So I was really nervous,</i>

32:42.425 --> 32:44.595
<i>but I worked so hard</i>
<i>at that audition.</i>

33:02.973 --> 33:04.814
<i>I was fortunate enough
to work with him before</i>

33:04.815 --> 33:07.150
on the promo tour,
and I see how he works

33:07.151 --> 33:08.750
and how dedicated he is

33:08.751 --> 33:10.553
<i>and how involved he</i>
<i>is with his music.</i>

33:10.554 --> 33:12.387
<i>It's not people just
telling him what to do.</i>

33:12.388 --> 33:14.222
<i>It's really coming from him.</i>

33:14.223 --> 33:16.726
<i>So it'd be such an honor</i>
<i>to be a part of his growth</i>

33:16.727 --> 33:19.095
<i>and watch his journey.</i>

33:19.096 --> 33:20.363
<i>Here, brother.</i>

33:20.364 --> 33:23.533
Hey, CJ. It's, uh, Jon Chu.

33:23.534 --> 33:25.701
Most jobs, you don't get a
personal call like that.

33:25.702 --> 33:27.569
So when that happened,
it really, like,

33:27.570 --> 33:29.338
I really feel like
I earned my spot.

33:40.298 --> 33:42.218
I remember your exact words.
You were like...

33:42.219 --> 33:44.221
You got the job.
You're going on the tour.

33:45.221 --> 33:46.422
<i>Are you serious?</i>

33:46.423 --> 33:47.690
I was, like, screaming.

33:47.691 --> 33:49.659
I was like, uh, just tears.

33:49.660 --> 33:51.193
<i>I'm so excited</i>
<i>to work with you, Jon.</i>

33:51.194 --> 33:53.261
<i>- I'm so excited.</i>
- Me, too.

33:53.262 --> 33:56.531
And then that moment that
it became ours, it was,

33:56.532 --> 33:59.269
I mean, yeah,
completely indescribable.

34:07.898 --> 34:09.178
I think he just started crying.

34:09.179 --> 34:10.179
I think he was crying.

34:11.481 --> 34:13.748
We made him cry, yes.

34:13.750 --> 34:16.252
<i>- Make your dreams come true
- True</i>

34:16.253 --> 34:18.187
<i>Miami...</i>

34:18.188 --> 34:20.455
<i>I need you to put</i>
<i>your hands in the air,</i>

34:20.456 --> 34:23.201
<i>right now, hands up!</i>

34:31.201 --> 34:32.603
<i>Show you off</i>

34:33.603 --> 34:36.273
<i>Tonight I wanna show you off</i>

34:38.407 --> 34:41.275
<i>What you got</i>

34:41.277 --> 34:42.717
<i>A billion could've never bought</i>

34:46.416 --> 34:50.252
<i>We gonna party</i>
<i>like it's 3012 tonight</i>

34:50.253 --> 34:53.788
<i>I wanna show you</i>
<i>all the finer things in life</i>

34:53.789 --> 34:55.857
<i>So just forget about the world</i>

34:55.858 --> 34:57.727
<i>We're young tonight</i>

34:57.728 --> 35:00.263
<i>I'm coming for ya</i>
<i>I'm coming for ya</i>

35:00.264 --> 35:04.936
<i>'Cause all I need</i>

35:05.936 --> 35:09.638
<i>Is a beauty and a beat</i>

35:09.639 --> 35:11.774
<i>Who can make my life complete</i>

35:11.775 --> 35:13.411
<i>Once again, Miami,
hands up right now.</i>

35:15.411 --> 35:16.444
<i>Let's go.</i>

35:16.445 --> 35:19.381
<i>It's all about you</i>

35:19.382 --> 35:21.183
<i>Hands up.</i>

35:21.184 --> 35:23.621
<i>When the music makes you move</i>

35:24.621 --> 35:28.527
<i>Baby, do it like you do...</i>

35:31.527 --> 35:34.263
<i>We had about eight or 12 weeks
to put this show together.</i>

35:34.264 --> 35:37.732
<i>We had to build custom sets</i>
<i>and design the costumes</i>

35:37.733 --> 35:39.634
<i>and the music.
In the middle of it all,</i>

35:39.635 --> 35:41.102
<i>Scooter and Justin</i>
<i>came to me, they're like,</i>

35:41.103 --> 35:44.372
"Hey, we're gonna shoot this music
video for <i> Beauty and A Beat."</i>

35:44.373 --> 35:46.241
"Oh, that's great,
have fun."

35:46.242 --> 35:48.544
<i>Scooter said, "I don't
think you understand.</i>

35:48.545 --> 35:51.682
<i>"We'd really love it if you
were to help Justin direct it."</i>

35:52.682 --> 35:55.718
I said, "What?"

35:55.719 --> 35:57.386
<i>All right.</i>
<i>No peeing in the water.</i>

35:57.387 --> 35:59.893
So five, six, seven, eight.

36:07.563 --> 36:08.563
One more time, sorry.

36:09.432 --> 36:10.871
One, two, three, four.

36:14.871 --> 36:17.506
It's all in his hands
'cause he's the one

36:17.507 --> 36:19.475
<i>who's holding the camera,</i>
<i>shooting the thing,</i>

36:19.476 --> 36:20.810
<i>directing the thing.</i>

36:20.811 --> 36:22.778
<i>And he's dancing
in between all of that.</i>

36:22.779 --> 36:24.279
<i>Yes.</i>

36:24.280 --> 36:25.314
<i>And we have, like, 50 dancers,</i>

36:25.315 --> 36:26.749
<i>synchronized swimmers</i>
<i>on the side,</i>

36:26.750 --> 36:28.484
<i>people flipping into the water.</i>

36:28.485 --> 36:31.988
<i>We gonna party</i>
<i>like it's 3012 tonight</i>

36:31.989 --> 36:35.790
<i>I wanna show you</i>
<i>all the finer things in life</i>

36:35.791 --> 36:37.792
<i>So just forget about the world</i>

36:37.793 --> 36:39.694
<i>We're young tonight</i>

36:39.695 --> 36:42.631
<i>I'm coming for ya</i>
<i>I'm coming for ya</i>

36:42.632 --> 36:43.632
<i>'Cause all...</i>

36:44.001 --> 36:45.734
Nicki Minaj will be there.

36:45.735 --> 36:46.968
We're gonna throw her
in the water.

36:46.969 --> 36:48.236
Uh, I'm just kidding.

36:48.237 --> 36:50.947
I wanna know how Nicki Minaj
is gonna get on that platform.

36:57.240 --> 36:59.881
I feel like there's a lot of things
we haven't thought about yet.

36:59.882 --> 37:01.651
We should probably
harness her in somehow.

37:01.652 --> 37:03.051
- Just lift her.
- Yeah.

37:03.052 --> 37:05.488
<i>When the music makes you move</i>

37:05.489 --> 37:09.628
<i>Baby, do it like you do</i>

37:11.628 --> 37:13.529
<i>In time, ink lines</i>

37:13.530 --> 37:15.363
<i>Bitches couldn't get</i>
<i>on my incline</i>

37:15.364 --> 37:17.366
<i>World tours, it's mine</i>

37:17.367 --> 37:18.968
<i>Ten little letters on a big sign</i>

37:18.969 --> 37:22.738
<i>Justin Bieber, you know</i>
<i>I'mma hit 'em with the ether</i>

37:22.739 --> 37:24.640
<i>Buns out, wiener</i>

37:24.641 --> 37:26.642
<i>But I gotta keep</i>
<i>an eye out for Selena</i>

37:26.643 --> 37:27.743
<i>Beauty, beauty and the beast</i>

37:27.744 --> 37:28.810
<i>Beauty from the east</i>

37:28.811 --> 37:30.479
<i>Beautiful confessions</i>
<i>of the priest</i>

37:30.480 --> 37:31.747
<i>Beast, beauty from the streets</i>

37:31.748 --> 37:32.747
<i>We don't get deceased</i>

37:32.748 --> 37:34.417
<i>Every time a beauty on the beats</i>

37:34.418 --> 37:36.685
<i>Body rock, oh</i>

37:36.686 --> 37:39.988
<i>I wanna feel your body rock</i>

37:39.989 --> 37:41.556
<i>Raise your hands up, let's go.</i>

37:41.557 --> 37:42.760
<i>'Cause all</i>

37:44.760 --> 37:49.400
<i>I need is a beauty and a beat</i>

37:50.400 --> 37:53.771
<i>Who can make my life complete</i>

37:55.771 --> 37:56.771
<i>'Cause...</i>

38:12.054 --> 38:13.989
Here he comes,
here he comes. Yeah.

38:19.950 --> 38:21.430
<i>And everyone's</i>
<i>cheering at the end.</i>

38:21.431 --> 38:23.466
<i>That is true, true joy</i>

38:23.467 --> 38:26.502
because everyone's
so tired and excited

38:26.503 --> 38:28.604
<i>that Justin got to direct</i>
<i>his first music video.</i>

38:28.605 --> 38:30.105
That's awesome.

38:30.106 --> 38:35.106
<i>Justin Bieber.</i>

38:56.967 --> 38:57.967
Yeah!

39:08.110 --> 39:09.152
Oh, my God.

39:15.152 --> 39:18.921
- Hannah?
- Hey, that's enough.

39:18.922 --> 39:21.159
You got me tickets
to Justin Bieber!

39:23.726 --> 39:24.726
Okay. That's enough.

39:38.802 --> 39:40.042
<i>When I start choreographing,</i>

39:40.043 --> 39:42.614
<i>I just try to hear
what the song is about.</i>

39:44.395 --> 39:46.915
<i>I try not to, like, control the
song, what I want it to do.</i>

39:46.916 --> 39:48.750
The song was there before I was,

39:48.751 --> 39:50.153
<i>so I let it move me.</i>

39:50.154 --> 39:52.922
<i>I try to, like, show you what</i>
<i>the song should look like.</i>

40:05.534 --> 40:07.703
This show is crazy.
We rehearsed, you know,

40:07.704 --> 40:09.839
12-hour days, you know, for
about two months straight

40:09.840 --> 40:10.840
<i>with Justin.</i>

40:12.175 --> 40:13.878
Hey, not like that.

40:14.878 --> 40:17.546
- Zoop. Zoop.
- Yeah!

40:17.547 --> 40:19.647
- All right. I'm good.
- Zoop, yeah.

40:19.648 --> 40:21.648
Hoorah, baby.

40:24.674 --> 40:26.154
I think the hardest
part was taking it

40:26.155 --> 40:28.656
from the dance studio
to the actual set,

40:28.657 --> 40:31.794
<i>and the actual toaster lifts</i>
<i>and the actual fly gags</i>

40:31.795 --> 40:33.895
<i>and timing-wise and
transitioning everything,</i>

40:33.896 --> 40:35.930
<i>I think that was</i>
<i>the hardest part.</i>

40:35.931 --> 40:37.232
And I'm going up
while this is playing?

40:37.233 --> 40:39.834
<i>Justin, he had a lot more input.</i>

40:39.835 --> 40:42.104
<i>Here he had his own ideas</i>
<i>he wanted to contribute,</i>

40:42.105 --> 40:44.772
so it's a lot more of him
giving himself to his fans,

40:44.773 --> 40:46.893
um, which makes the show
a lot more personal to him.

40:52.548 --> 40:54.950
Being young and in the industry,

40:54.951 --> 40:57.989
there's a lot of things that
people tell you to say, right?

40:58.822 --> 41:00.022
The music that I'm making now,

41:00.023 --> 41:01.790
it's all creatively
coming from me,

41:01.791 --> 41:03.225
and I wanna do what I want.

41:03.226 --> 41:06.095
Like, if I'm not happy
with what I wanna do

41:06.096 --> 41:08.266
and who I wanna be, then who...

41:10.266 --> 41:12.869
I'm not gonna be happy.

41:13.869 --> 41:16.138
<i>We talked a lot about</i>
<i>what does this album mean.</i>

41:16.139 --> 41:18.774
And he says, "You know what, a
lot of people want me to fail."

41:18.775 --> 41:19.875
But he's like,
"That doesn't bother me.

41:19.876 --> 41:21.877
<i>"'Cause no matter what,
my fans are there</i>

41:21.878 --> 41:23.279
<i>"and they'll make me fly."</i>

41:23.280 --> 41:24.946
And that really triggered,
in my mind, like,

41:24.947 --> 41:26.508
"All right, we're gonna
make you fly."

41:27.182 --> 41:29.685
<i>You're gonna come in</i>
<i>and you're gonna fly.</i>

41:29.686 --> 41:32.087
<i>With the cheers of your audience,
they're gonna keep you up,</i>

41:32.088 --> 41:36.158
<i>and you're gonna fly in on wings made of
instruments because it's your talent.</i>

41:36.159 --> 41:37.826
<i>And instruments,</i>
<i>not just random instruments,</i>

41:37.827 --> 41:39.294
<i>but instruments that you play.</i>

41:39.295 --> 41:41.129
<i>So we have drums.</i>
<i>We have keyboards.</i>

41:41.130 --> 41:43.165
<i>We have all these things
that he plays</i>

41:43.166 --> 41:45.301
<i>built into these wings</i>
<i>to symbolize</i>

41:45.302 --> 41:47.970
<i>that he's built of</i>
<i>many, many parts.</i>

41:47.971 --> 41:50.172
<i>That's what makes him</i>
<i>Justin Bieber.</i>

41:54.978 --> 41:56.284
<i>As long as you love me</i>

42:01.284 --> 42:03.852
<i>As long as you love me</i>

42:03.853 --> 42:05.988
<i>We're under pressure</i>

42:05.989 --> 42:09.659
<i>Seven billion people in the
world trying to fit in</i>

42:10.659 --> 42:12.861
<i>Keep it together</i>

42:12.862 --> 42:17.066
<i>Smile on your face even</i>
<i>though your heart is frowning</i>

42:17.067 --> 42:20.335
<i>But hey now, you know, girl</i>

42:20.336 --> 42:23.906
<i>We both know it's a cruel world</i>

42:23.907 --> 42:27.878
<i>But I will take my chances</i>

42:28.878 --> 42:30.014
<i>As long as you love me</i>

42:31.014 --> 42:34.149
<i>We could be starving</i>
<i>We could be homeless</i>

42:34.150 --> 42:35.951
<i>We could be broke</i>

42:35.952 --> 42:37.919
<i>As long as you love me</i>

42:37.920 --> 42:40.989
<i>I'll be your platinum</i>
<i>I'll be your silver</i>

42:40.990 --> 42:42.825
<i>I'll be your gold</i>

42:42.826 --> 42:49.631
<i>As long as you love me</i>

42:49.632 --> 42:55.005
<i>As long as you love me</i>

42:56.005 --> 42:57.210
<i>Love me</i>

43:00.210 --> 43:02.710
<i>I'll be your soldier</i>

43:02.711 --> 43:04.879
<i>Fighting every second of the day</i>

43:04.880 --> 43:06.848
<i>For your dreams, girl</i>

43:06.849 --> 43:09.384
<i>I'll be your Hova</i>

43:09.385 --> 43:11.720
<i>You could be my Destiny's Child</i>

43:11.721 --> 43:13.821
<i>On the scene, girl</i>

43:13.822 --> 43:15.290
<i>But don't stress</i>

43:15.291 --> 43:16.859
<i>And don't cry</i>

43:16.860 --> 43:20.729
<i>No, we don't need</i>
<i>no wings to fly</i>

43:20.730 --> 43:24.802
<i>Just take my hand</i>

43:25.802 --> 43:27.368
<i>As long as you love me</i>

43:27.369 --> 43:30.973
<i>We could be starving</i>
<i>We could be homeless</i>

43:30.974 --> 43:32.808
<i>We could be broke</i>

43:32.809 --> 43:34.442
<i>As long as you love me</i>

43:34.443 --> 43:37.680
<i>I'll be your platinum</i>
<i>I'll be your silver</i>

43:37.681 --> 43:39.314
<i>I'll be your gold</i>

43:39.315 --> 43:46.221
<i>As long as you love me</i>

43:46.222 --> 43:51.759
<i>As long as you love me</i>

43:51.760 --> 43:52.760
<i>Yo, B-I-G</i>

43:54.697 --> 43:56.265
<i>I don't know if this makes sense</i>

43:56.266 --> 43:59.100
<i>But you're my hallelujah</i>

43:59.101 --> 44:01.035
<i>Give me a time and place,</i>
<i>I'll rendezvous it</i>

44:01.036 --> 44:02.805
<i>I'll fly you to it,</i>
<i>I'll beat you there</i>

44:02.806 --> 44:04.272
<i>Girl, you know I got you</i>

44:04.273 --> 44:05.273
<i>Us, trust...</i>

44:05.896 --> 44:07.776
<i>A couple of things</i>
<i>I can't spell without "u"</i>

44:07.777 --> 44:09.078
<i>Now we are on top of the world</i>

44:09.079 --> 44:10.879
<i>'Cause that's just how we do</i>

44:10.880 --> 44:12.346
<i>Used to tell me sky's the limit</i>

44:12.347 --> 44:14.283
<i>Now the sky's our point of view</i>

44:14.284 --> 44:16.285
<i>We'll be stepping out like, whoa</i>

44:16.286 --> 44:17.886
<i>Cameras point and shoot</i>

44:17.887 --> 44:19.321
<i>Ask me what's my best side</i>

44:19.322 --> 44:21.355
<i>I stand back and point at you</i>

44:21.356 --> 44:22.790
<i>You, you the one</i>
<i>that I argue with</i>

44:22.791 --> 44:24.959
<i>I feel like I need a new
girl to be bothered with</i>

44:24.960 --> 44:27.029
<i>But the grass ain't always
greener on the other side</i>

44:27.030 --> 44:28.296
<i>It's green where you water it</i>

44:28.297 --> 44:29.964
<i>So I know we got issues, baby</i>

44:29.965 --> 44:31.366
<i>True, true, true</i>

44:31.367 --> 44:32.928
<i>But I'd rather work</i>
<i>on this with you</i>

44:33.001 --> 44:34.803
<i>Than to go ahead
and start with someone new</i>

44:34.804 --> 44:36.238
<i>As long as you love me</i>

44:36.239 --> 44:39.374
<i>We could be starving</i>
<i>We could be homeless</i>

44:39.375 --> 44:40.375
<i>We could be broke</i>

44:41.143 --> 44:43.044
<i>As long as you love me</i>

44:43.045 --> 44:45.980
<i>I'll be your platinum</i>
<i>I'll be your silver</i>

44:45.981 --> 44:47.082
<i>I'll be your gold</i>

44:47.083 --> 44:48.317
<i>Miami, make some noise!</i>

44:48.318 --> 44:54.922
<i>As long as you love me</i>

44:54.923 --> 45:00.431
<i>As long as you love me</i>

45:08.538 --> 45:11.177
<i>As long as you love me</i>

45:15.177 --> 45:18.282
<i>As long as you love me</i>

45:26.188 --> 45:28.357
<i>As long as you love me</i>

45:28.358 --> 45:31.192
<i>I'll be your platinum</i>

45:31.193 --> 45:34.129
<i>I'll be your silver</i>

45:34.130 --> 45:36.131
<i>I'll be your gold</i>

45:36.132 --> 45:39.268
<i>As long as you...</i>

45:45.942 --> 45:49.077
<i>As long as you...</i>

45:55.050 --> 45:58.521
<i>As long as you...</i>

46:04.594 --> 46:07.896
<i>As long as you...</i>

46:14.103 --> 46:16.538
<i>As long as you love me</i>

46:16.539 --> 46:19.107
<i>We could be starving</i>

46:19.108 --> 46:22.143
<i>We could be homeless</i>

46:22.144 --> 46:23.148
<i>We could be broke</i>

46:27.150 --> 46:28.204
Justin!

46:48.204 --> 46:52.174
<i>Baby, baby, baby, oh</i>

46:52.175 --> 46:55.280
<i>Six-year-old Avalanna Routh</i>
<i>is a huge Justin Bieber fan.</i>

46:58.280 --> 47:00.482
<i>And now there's a Facebook page</i>

47:00.483 --> 47:04.986
<i>dedicated to trying to get her
to meet the pop superstar.</i>

47:04.987 --> 47:08.189
<i>Avalanna had become</i>
<i>Mrs. Bieber at her hospital.</i>

47:08.190 --> 47:10.158
<i>She had a rare disease.</i>

47:10.159 --> 47:13.160
She loved Justin and they got
a cardboard cutout of Justin.

47:13.161 --> 47:15.430
<i>And she had a whole fake
wedding at her hospital</i>

47:15.431 --> 47:16.591
<i>with this cardboard cutout.</i>

47:17.000 --> 47:19.167
<i>And it was</i>
<i>on the news in Boston.</i>

47:19.168 --> 47:21.904
<i>And I was just blown away.</i>
<i>She was adorable.</i>

47:21.905 --> 47:23.538
<i>So I called Justin.</i>
<i>He said, "Let's meet her.</i>

47:23.539 --> 47:25.239
<i>"I'm gonna be</i>
<i>in New York next week.</i>

47:25.240 --> 47:27.642
<i>"Let's bring her</i>
<i>down from Boston."</i>

47:27.643 --> 47:29.645
<i>And, you know, it was supposed
to be a quick meet and greet,</i>

47:29.646 --> 47:31.550
<i>and he ended up
spending hours with her.</i>

47:34.384 --> 47:36.384
I met with her and it wasn't...
It wasn't normal.

47:36.385 --> 47:37.919
It was different.

47:37.920 --> 47:39.687
It wasn't like I was
just meeting another fan.

47:39.688 --> 47:41.489
It was like...
It was so special.

47:41.490 --> 47:43.491
<i>I sat down. I played</i>
<i>board games with her.</i>

47:43.492 --> 47:45.929
I thought she was
super adorable.

47:46.929 --> 47:49.430
<i>It is.</i>

47:49.431 --> 47:51.500
<i>And they got really, really
close like a big brother,</i>

47:51.501 --> 47:53.535
<i>but she called him her husband.</i>

47:53.536 --> 47:55.337
<i>And he called her</i>
<i>Mrs. Bieber.</i>

47:55.338 --> 47:56.699
- Name is?
- She is Mrs. Bieber.

47:57.005 --> 47:58.806
And basically she had
her own little wedding

47:59.007 --> 48:00.676
- at the hospital.
- Yeah.

48:00.677 --> 48:02.977
She was like,
"You're my husband,

48:02.978 --> 48:05.046
"so my mom's
your mother-in-law."

48:05.047 --> 48:08.954
And she's so little and it's
like, "Wow, she's so cute."

48:15.057 --> 48:17.591
Ducks, ducks, ducks.
Quack, quack, quack.

48:17.592 --> 48:19.628
Smooth.

48:50.592 --> 48:54.229
Avalanna put her hands over her
ears and he was singing to her.

48:54.230 --> 48:55.430
And then he goes, "What's
wrong?" And she goes,

48:55.431 --> 48:57.631
"It's so loud in here.
Why are they screaming?

48:57.632 --> 48:59.567
"You're my husband."

48:59.568 --> 49:01.605
<i>What, are they...
Are they just really loud?</i>

49:02.605 --> 49:04.205
<i>They're very loud.</i>

49:04.206 --> 49:05.473
<i>They're very loud.</i>

49:05.474 --> 49:07.442
<i>But that's a good thing.</i>

49:07.443 --> 49:08.810
<i>That's a good thing</i>
<i>because that just means</i>

49:08.811 --> 49:10.811
<i>they're really supportive fans.</i>

49:12.148 --> 49:14.415
<i>Yeah.</i>

49:14.416 --> 49:16.496
<i>So, we're gonna get</i>
<i>you back over there to Mom.</i>

49:17.019 --> 49:18.553
<i>But did you have fun up here?</i>

49:18.554 --> 49:21.756
<i>Yeah, I have to wear earphones.</i>

49:21.757 --> 49:23.558
<i>Okay.</i>

49:23.559 --> 49:26.794
<i>Okay. Well, we'll get you another
pair of earphones side stage, okay,</i>

49:26.795 --> 49:29.330
<i>and you can watch</i>
<i>the rest of the show?</i>

49:29.331 --> 49:31.033
<i>Is that gonna be cool?</i>

49:31.034 --> 49:32.200
<i>Yeah?</i>

49:32.201 --> 49:34.269
<i>Wanna give me a hug?</i>

49:36.172 --> 49:38.239
<i>Okay. We'll get you</i>
<i>some earphones, sweetie.</i>

49:38.240 --> 49:40.674
<i>Come on, let's go.</i>

49:40.675 --> 49:42.276
I love him.

49:42.277 --> 49:43.277
That was so cute.

49:45.148 --> 49:47.315
That was adorable.
Oh, my God.

50:00.262 --> 50:01.262
<i>And, uh...</i>

50:03.199 --> 50:05.299
<i>I'm sorry...</i>

50:05.300 --> 50:06.637
Oh, my God.

50:08.637 --> 50:10.822
<i>It's just like...</i>

50:26.822 --> 50:30.126
<i>But... Give a round of
applause for Avalanna.</i>

50:32.628 --> 50:33.628
<i>Then slowly...</i>

50:36.532 --> 50:38.105
...her talking,
her speech...

50:42.105 --> 50:44.738
...started to slow down.

50:44.739 --> 50:48.246
And her eye started
shutting on her left side.

50:50.246 --> 50:51.246
<i>And, um...</i>

50:59.155 --> 51:00.529
<i>It was just...</i>

51:06.529 --> 51:08.505
It was just hard to see.

51:15.505 --> 51:16.505
But...

51:24.380 --> 51:26.351
I miss her, bro.

51:42.498 --> 51:45.667
<i>Our first show, Avalanna unfortunately
died just four days earlier,</i>

51:45.668 --> 51:47.736
<i>and all of us were feeling it.</i>

51:47.737 --> 51:51.240
<i>Tonight's</i> Lonely Girl
<i>is super special</i>

51:52.240 --> 51:53.478
<i>because, um...</i>

51:55.478 --> 51:57.481
<i>This song is dedicated</i>

51:58.481 --> 52:00.387
<i>to, um, to sweet Avalanna.</i>

52:04.387 --> 52:06.855
<i>So, um...</i>

52:06.856 --> 52:10.961
<i>Avalanna, if you're listening,
I love you.</i>

52:12.961 --> 52:16.231
<i>And everyone... Everyone
in here loves you as well.</i>

52:17.500 --> 52:20.603
<i>So, um, this one's for you.</i>

52:23.873 --> 52:26.508
<i>One less lonely girl</i>

52:26.509 --> 52:29.578
<i>One less lonely girl</i>

52:29.579 --> 52:32.346
<i>And Justin didn't feel like</i>
<i>it was right to sing</i>

52:32.347 --> 52:35.216
<i>to a girl that night 'cause he
had just shared the last time</i>

52:35.217 --> 52:38.787
<i>he performed</i> One Less Lonely
Girl,<i> it was her in the chair.</i>

52:38.788 --> 52:42.524
<i>We took a bunch of pictures. We
put them into a huge montage.</i>

52:42.525 --> 52:44.526
<i>During</i> One Less Lonely Girl,
<i>we put them up on the screen.</i>

52:44.527 --> 52:45.493
<i>How many bags you packed</i>

52:45.494 --> 52:46.828
<i>Just to take them back?</i>

52:46.829 --> 52:49.363
<i>Tell me that</i>
<i>How many either or's?</i>

52:49.364 --> 52:53.834
<i>But no more if you let me</i>
<i>inside of your world</i>

52:53.835 --> 52:56.337
<i>There'll be one</i>
<i>less lonely girl...</i>

52:56.338 --> 52:57.973
<i>And he didn't walk to the chair.</i>

52:57.974 --> 53:00.875
<i>He walked to the top and he
stared and he sang to the screen.</i>

53:00.876 --> 53:01.876
<i>Before I saw you</i>

53:02.010 --> 53:03.715
<i>Now all I see is you</i>

53:06.715 --> 53:11.819
<i>Oh, no, don't need</i>
<i>these other pretty faces</i>

53:11.820 --> 53:13.888
<i>'Cause when you're mine,
in the world...</i>

53:13.889 --> 53:17.259
<i>I think that was</i>
<i>his way of saying goodbye.</i>

53:17.260 --> 53:18.727
<i>There's gonna be
one less lonely girl</i>

53:18.728 --> 53:21.663
<i>One less lonely girl</i>
<i>I'm coming for you</i>

53:21.664 --> 53:24.265
<i>One less lonely girl</i>
<i>I'm coming for you</i>

53:24.266 --> 53:26.500
<i>One less lonely girl</i>

53:26.501 --> 53:28.602
<i>There's gonna be</i>
<i>one less lonely girl</i>

53:28.603 --> 53:29.571
<i>I'm coming for you</i>

53:29.572 --> 53:32.540
<i>I'm gonna put you first</i>

53:32.541 --> 53:34.010
<i>I'll show you what you're worth</i>

53:35.010 --> 53:37.879
<i>If you let me inside</i>
<i>of your world</i>

53:37.880 --> 53:40.781
<i>There's gonna be</i>
<i>one less lonely girl</i>

53:40.782 --> 53:43.551
<i>One less lonely girl</i>
<i>I'm coming for you</i>

53:43.552 --> 53:46.354
<i>One less lonely girl</i>
<i>I'm coming for you</i>

53:46.355 --> 53:48.723
<i>One less lonely girl</i>

53:48.724 --> 53:51.692
<i>There's gonna be</i>
<i>one less lonely girl</i>

53:51.693 --> 53:52.928
<i>She touched all of</i>
<i>us in her short time</i>

53:52.929 --> 53:55.596
<i>on this planet, and, you know,
those are the things</i>

53:55.597 --> 53:57.499
<i>that make the job real.</i>

53:57.500 --> 53:59.467
<i>We'll never forget her.</i>

54:08.878 --> 54:11.579
That's row four,
seat one. Hot seats.

54:13.916 --> 54:17.986
<i>So things have changed since the
last tour and</i> Never Say Never.

54:17.987 --> 54:20.488
<i>It was an amazing experience</i>
<i>and something that</i>

54:20.489 --> 54:22.323
we'll all be proud of
the rest of our lives,

54:22.324 --> 54:23.658
but now we can't go outside.

54:23.659 --> 54:26.661
- You guys need tickets?
- No, no, we've got tickets.

54:27.797 --> 54:29.997
<i>Kenny goes
outside and gets mobbed.</i>

54:29.998 --> 54:31.899
Kenny!

54:31.900 --> 54:33.968
<i>Dan Kanter</i>

54:33.969 --> 54:36.504
<i>We wrote this song for you</i>

54:36.505 --> 54:38.105
<i>We hope you like it</i>

54:38.106 --> 54:41.106
<i>We really do</i>

54:41.245 --> 54:43.845
<i>You know, Allison can't choose the
</i> One Less Lonely Girl <i> anymore,</i>

54:43.846 --> 54:45.613
<i>so when I go outside now</i>

54:45.614 --> 54:48.415
<i>I have to literally
disguise myself or hide</i>

54:48.416 --> 54:52.787
to navigate the giveback
that we do every show,

54:52.788 --> 54:54.089
<i>'cause we still give</i>
<i>away those tickets.</i>

54:54.090 --> 54:55.756
Can we have a picture with you?

54:55.757 --> 54:57.892
Would you mind if I hug you?

54:57.893 --> 54:59.727
All right.
So here's my problem...

54:59.728 --> 55:01.629
Yeah.

55:01.630 --> 55:04.566
- I don't have enough tickets to take care of everybody.
- Aw.

55:04.567 --> 55:07.067
Who's gonna stay outside out of your six?
You gotta pick one person.

55:07.068 --> 55:09.770
Can we have a minute
to talk about it?

55:09.771 --> 55:12.211
- You wanna have a minute to talk about it?
- Yeah, a minute.

55:14.543 --> 55:17.444
I can't do that.
I want, like, you don't...

55:17.445 --> 55:18.445
I can't.

55:37.099 --> 55:39.135
No, no,
you were like one of the...

55:40.135 --> 55:41.672
What? So you won't go?

55:44.672 --> 55:46.908
All right.

55:46.909 --> 55:49.109
She's gonna stay. Hug her
'cause you guys get to go in.

55:49.110 --> 55:50.745
No, no.

55:50.746 --> 55:53.083
Hey, wait, come here,
come here, come here...

56:18.541 --> 56:20.010
You guys trying to buy tickets?

56:21.010 --> 56:23.076
You have tickets?
You have any?

56:23.077 --> 56:25.145
- Yeah, we did.
- What happened to them?

56:25.146 --> 56:27.047
They're fraud?

56:27.048 --> 56:28.515
And they said they're
fraud at the box office?

56:28.516 --> 56:30.084
- Yeah.
- Are you upset?

56:30.085 --> 56:31.856
Yeah.

56:33.856 --> 56:35.559
- Oh, my God.
- Shh. Shh.

56:37.559 --> 56:39.861
Oh, my God.

56:39.862 --> 56:41.664
I can't breathe.
Oh, my God.

56:44.532 --> 56:45.732
I'm gonna cry.

56:45.733 --> 56:46.834
Guys?

56:46.835 --> 56:48.835
Yes.

56:57.646 --> 56:59.966
Girls, you have to hurry to get
to your front row tickets.

57:04.853 --> 57:06.421
Front row!

57:06.422 --> 57:09.122
<i>We still go outside and make
sure kids are taken care of.</i>

57:09.123 --> 57:11.658
We still go up to the top
deck and upgrade people.

57:11.659 --> 57:13.419
And there's no better
feeling in the world.

57:15.164 --> 57:17.800
We just gotta be
a little sneakier about it.

57:18.800 --> 57:19.933
You don't owe me anything.

57:19.934 --> 57:20.934
We're good.
We're good.

57:38.786 --> 57:40.721
<i>Watch the cables
and watch your fingers,</i>

57:40.722 --> 57:42.894
video wall coming in.

57:45.894 --> 57:47.414
Okay. Lock number
one set, everybody.

58:29.771 --> 58:32.272
<i>Being on tour,
we go to city to city to city,</i>

58:32.273 --> 58:35.810
<i>that schedule, it's so draining.</i>

58:35.811 --> 58:38.145
<i>He would just be on the bus</i>

58:38.146 --> 58:40.684
and he'll just be
in a stare, just like...

58:42.684 --> 58:44.218
And I'll just
be like, "Hey."

58:44.219 --> 58:47.721
<i>It's 7:00 a.m., barely slept
anything, just had a show,</i>

58:47.722 --> 58:50.158
<i>three shows in a row,</i>
<i>so exhausted.</i>

58:50.159 --> 58:53.929
<i>You just wanna run in the
hotel and just go to sleep.</i>

58:57.520 --> 58:59.600
This go round is way more
popular than in my world.

58:59.601 --> 59:00.968
There's a lot more
people outside.

59:00.969 --> 59:03.569
There's a lot more people at the
bus, so it's hard to be normal.

59:05.273 --> 59:08.609
<i>We can sneak off and try to
be as normal as possible.</i>

59:08.610 --> 59:11.014
<i>But feeling normal,
I don't think that's possible.</i>

59:12.014 --> 59:15.082
When he's hiding in the trunk of a
car so we can go get ice cream,

59:15.083 --> 59:18.118
sticking his hand out
of the trunk just to feel air

59:18.119 --> 59:21.089
<i>so he doesn't, like,</i>
<i>go crazy of claustrophobia,</i>

59:21.090 --> 59:23.691
<i>and we're doing all of this</i>
<i>just to sneak to go grab</i>

59:23.692 --> 59:25.093
<i>some ice cream.</i>

59:25.094 --> 59:26.655
How can that even
feel halfway normal?

59:32.635 --> 59:35.770
He's gotta go through things with everyone
watching every step that he makes.

59:35.771 --> 59:37.238
Justin, do you love your fans?

59:37.239 --> 59:39.272
Do you love your fans, Justin?

59:39.273 --> 59:42.877
There's somewhat of a gift
and a curse in being popular.

59:42.878 --> 59:44.812
Move out of the way, man.

59:44.813 --> 59:46.053
You gotta move out of the way.

59:52.721 --> 59:53.721
What'd you say?

59:56.257 --> 59:59.761
I'd been chased by those
same people that whole trip,

59:59.762 --> 01:00:01.722
and they were talking
nonsense the whole time,

01:00:02.231 --> 01:00:04.365
like verbally assaulting me.

01:00:06.768 --> 01:00:08.129
As a human being,
rage comes out,

01:00:09.003 --> 01:00:11.672
and I happened to snap,
and I opened the door

01:00:11.673 --> 01:00:12.707
and I was like, "What do you...

01:00:12.708 --> 01:00:14.708
"What are you guys..."
I really wanted to hit him.

01:00:17.279 --> 01:00:18.279
<i>We ended up peeling off.</i>

01:00:22.251 --> 01:00:23.451
I learned from that.

01:00:23.452 --> 01:00:25.118
That's what they wanted.

01:00:25.119 --> 01:00:27.254
They wanted to get
a reaction out of me

01:00:27.255 --> 01:00:28.689
<i>so that they could print that,</i>

01:00:28.690 --> 01:00:31.292
so that they could
make me seem like this,

01:00:31.293 --> 01:00:34.162
"Oh, I'm out of control."
But really I'm just...

01:00:34.163 --> 01:00:36.863
I have a heart
and I have feelings.

01:00:36.864 --> 01:00:39.466
And when people...
When people...

01:00:39.467 --> 01:00:42.703
...like hurt my heart,
I'm gonna get angry, upset

01:00:42.704 --> 01:00:44.664
and lash out sometimes
'cause I'm a human being.

01:00:59.353 --> 01:01:00.755
<i>Here we go.</i>

01:01:15.137 --> 01:01:16.219
<i>Here we go.</i>

01:01:30.219 --> 01:01:31.219
<i>Here we go.</i>

01:01:38.159 --> 01:01:39.237
<i>Here we go.</i>

01:01:51.172 --> 01:01:52.965
<i>Here we go.</i>

01:02:22.103 --> 01:02:24.171
<i>Here we go.</i>

01:02:24.172 --> 01:02:26.908
<i>She don't like the flash</i>

01:02:26.909 --> 01:02:29.014
<i>Wanna keep us in the dark</i>

01:02:32.014 --> 01:02:34.381
<i>She don't like the fame</i>

01:02:34.382 --> 01:02:38.084
<i>Hate it when we're miles apart</i>

01:02:38.085 --> 01:02:39.886
<i>Here we go.</i>

01:02:39.887 --> 01:02:43.825
<i>It's getting to the point</i>
<i>where it's too much for her</i>

01:02:43.826 --> 01:02:47.160
<i>Throw us all away</i>
<i>'cause it's too much for her</i>

01:02:47.161 --> 01:02:50.198
<i>She can't hide away</i>

01:02:50.199 --> 01:02:53.100
<i>'Cause the world</i>
<i>knows who we are</i>

01:02:53.101 --> 01:02:55.036
<i>She don't like the lights</i>

01:02:59.208 --> 01:03:01.142
<i>She don't, she don't, she don't</i>

01:03:01.143 --> 01:03:03.077
<i>She don't like the lights</i>

01:03:06.914 --> 01:03:09.149
<i>She don't, she don't, she don't</i>

01:03:09.150 --> 01:03:11.384
<i>Don't wanna share</i>
<i>with no one else</i>

01:03:11.385 --> 01:03:13.087
<i>Want me to herself</i>

01:03:13.088 --> 01:03:16.524
<i>Don't want no love</i>
<i>in front of the camera</i>

01:03:16.525 --> 01:03:18.126
<i>She don't like the lights</i>

01:03:22.396 --> 01:03:24.198
<i>She don't, she don't, she don't</i>

01:03:24.199 --> 01:03:25.732
<i>She don't like the lights</i>

01:03:25.733 --> 01:03:28.435
<i>Bieber is no stranger
to flipping off photographers,</i>

01:03:28.436 --> 01:03:30.471
<i>but is his behavior</i>
<i>becoming more erratic?</i>

01:03:30.472 --> 01:03:32.138
<i>He's out of control.</i>

01:03:32.139 --> 01:03:33.476
<i>She's giving ultimatums</i>

01:03:35.476 --> 01:03:38.447
<i>She don't like this life</i>

01:03:39.447 --> 01:03:43.183
<i>She said if I loved her</i>

01:03:43.184 --> 01:03:45.387
<i>I'd give it up,</i>
<i>won't think twice</i>

01:03:48.090 --> 01:03:49.957
<i>I can't do that</i>

01:03:49.958 --> 01:03:52.199
<i>It's getting to the point</i>
<i>where it's too much for her</i>

01:03:53.195 --> 01:03:54.662
<i>Wanna throw it all away</i>

01:03:54.663 --> 01:03:57.163
<i>'Cause it's too much for her</i>

01:03:57.164 --> 01:04:00.038
<i>She don't wanna live this life</i>

01:04:03.038 --> 01:04:04.610
- <i> Oh
- She don't like the lights</i>

01:04:08.610 --> 01:04:10.944
<i>She don't, she don't, she don't</i>

01:04:10.945 --> 01:04:12.284
<i>She don't like the lights</i>

01:04:16.284 --> 01:04:18.653
<i>She don't, she don't, she don't</i>

01:04:18.654 --> 01:04:21.221
<i>Don't wanna share</i>
<i>with no one else</i>

01:04:21.222 --> 01:04:22.957
<i>Want me to herself</i>

01:04:22.958 --> 01:04:26.127
<i>Don't want no love</i>
<i>in front of the camera</i>

01:04:26.128 --> 01:04:28.130
<i>She don't like the lights</i>

01:04:32.067 --> 01:04:34.201
<i>She don't, she don't, she don't</i>

01:04:34.202 --> 01:04:35.535
<i>She don't like the lights</i>

01:04:35.536 --> 01:04:39.707
<i>How can I choose between the two</i>

01:04:39.708 --> 01:04:43.511
<i>When all the lights</i>
<i>are all I know?</i>

01:04:43.512 --> 01:04:47.515
<i>I wish she could see</i>
<i>how good this can be</i>

01:04:47.516 --> 01:04:51.218
<i>I hope that she waits</i>
<i>a little bit longer</i>

01:04:51.219 --> 01:04:55.089
<i>'Cause I don't wanna live life</i>

01:04:55.090 --> 01:04:59.493
<i>Without her by my side</i>

01:04:59.494 --> 01:05:03.199
<i>'Cause she gives
the light that's in me</i>

01:05:04.199 --> 01:05:06.407
<i>But she don't know</i>

01:05:12.407 --> 01:05:14.547
<i>She don't like the lights</i>

01:05:18.547 --> 01:05:20.314
<i>She don't, she don't, she don't</i>

01:05:20.315 --> 01:05:22.090
<i>She don't like the lights</i>

01:05:28.090 --> 01:05:30.057
<i>She don't like the lights</i>

01:05:34.096 --> 01:05:35.457
<i>She don't, she don't, she don't</i>

01:05:36.030 --> 01:05:37.266
<i>She don't like the lights</i>

01:05:41.737 --> 01:05:43.738
<i>She don't, she don't, she don't</i>

01:05:43.739 --> 01:05:45.474
<i>She don't like the lights</i>

01:05:55.317 --> 01:05:57.551
People on the outside
look in at celebrities,

01:05:57.552 --> 01:06:00.023
especially people like Lindsay
Lohan, Britney, almost...

01:06:01.023 --> 01:06:02.355
They feel sad.

01:06:02.356 --> 01:06:03.656
You look at Michael Jackson,
you feel sad

01:06:03.657 --> 01:06:05.326
because they're like,
you can't...

01:06:05.327 --> 01:06:06.761
- Yes.
- ...escape this.

01:06:06.762 --> 01:06:10.698
It is an inevitability that a young
person will become a train wreck.

01:06:10.699 --> 01:06:12.433
Do you think about that?

01:06:12.434 --> 01:06:15.102
And are you conscious that you
are the perfect candidate

01:06:15.103 --> 01:06:17.103
to become a train wreck?

01:06:17.105 --> 01:06:18.406
You are.

01:06:18.407 --> 01:06:19.540
- We talk about this all the time.
- Um.

01:06:19.541 --> 01:06:21.776
What? We talk about
this all the time.

01:06:21.777 --> 01:06:22.910
There's no train wreck.

01:06:22.911 --> 01:06:26.247
What... I'm living here,
I'm 19, by myself in this...

01:06:26.248 --> 01:06:28.582
In this great house, just...

01:06:28.583 --> 01:06:29.817
But that's where
the train wreck can start.

01:06:29.818 --> 01:06:31.285
- How can... How?
- 'Cause it's safe.

01:06:31.286 --> 01:06:32.486
- 'Cause it's a bubble.
- But there's no...

01:06:32.487 --> 01:06:34.788
No one can tell you no.
So now what?

01:06:34.789 --> 01:06:36.689
Now what are you gonna do
when no one can say no?

01:06:36.690 --> 01:06:38.663
No one can say no,
but here's the thing,

01:06:41.663 --> 01:06:44.131
for me, I've seen it happen.

01:06:44.132 --> 01:06:45.698
I can't...

01:06:45.699 --> 01:06:49.335
I'm not gonna be
stupid enough to...

01:06:49.336 --> 01:06:51.605
For me to let
that happen to myself

01:06:51.606 --> 01:06:54.375
because I have a good
head on my shoulders.

01:06:54.376 --> 01:06:57.178
Maybe I might make a few
mistakes, sure, I'm 19.

01:06:57.179 --> 01:06:59.779
But I was raised, like,
Sunday school every Sunday,

01:06:59.780 --> 01:07:02.283
like, I was the... My mom
broke it down to me,

01:07:02.284 --> 01:07:05.453
like, this is who you are,
you're gonna be a good person,

01:07:05.454 --> 01:07:07.654
you're gonna help people, you're
gonna be quick to forgive,

01:07:07.655 --> 01:07:10.825
you're gonna be a humble,
genuine person.

01:07:10.826 --> 01:07:14.727
And if you're not, there's
gonna be consequences.

01:07:14.728 --> 01:07:17.730
She doesn't agree with some
of the decisions that I make.

01:07:17.731 --> 01:07:20.801
Sometimes... Well, all
moms don't agree with...

01:07:20.802 --> 01:07:23.303
But she knows that I got
a good head on my shoulders.

01:07:23.304 --> 01:07:25.406
She did what she
had to do to raise me.

01:07:25.407 --> 01:07:26.874
And she did a wonderful,
wonderful job.

01:07:26.875 --> 01:07:30.845
And I'm super,
super grateful for her.

01:07:30.846 --> 01:07:34.483
You know what, I don't like your
attitude, to be quite honest.

01:07:35.483 --> 01:07:36.716
You're mad.

01:07:36.717 --> 01:07:39.185
Because, you know what,
you're too young

01:07:39.186 --> 01:07:41.355
to be peepeeing in buckets
and driving up and down

01:07:41.356 --> 01:07:43.223
the highway fast.

01:07:43.224 --> 01:07:46.727
I don't think your mom would really
mind if a stranger whipped her son.

01:07:46.728 --> 01:07:48.396
You ain't spanking me, man.

01:07:49.396 --> 01:07:50.797
Ow! What are you doing?

01:07:50.798 --> 01:07:52.202
What are you doing?

01:07:55.202 --> 01:07:56.202
Whoo!

01:08:02.878 --> 01:08:04.684
So who are you dating now?

01:08:09.684 --> 01:08:13.734
So I'm backstage at,
um, my concert.

01:08:25.734 --> 01:08:28.568
I just wanted to make this video

01:08:28.569 --> 01:08:30.645
because I just saw Justin's VD.

01:08:37.645 --> 01:08:41.314
You really inspire me.
I really, like...

01:08:41.314 --> 01:08:44.658
You're the reason why I wake up with
a smile on my face every morning.

01:08:50.658 --> 01:08:52.234
Yes, I will stay
with you forever.

01:08:59.234 --> 01:09:01.335
I just love you so much, Justin,

01:09:01.336 --> 01:09:03.403
and hope you're
gonna see this video

01:09:03.404 --> 01:09:06.273
'cause otherwise I'm
really gonna look stupid.

01:09:06.274 --> 01:09:08.408
Yeah.

01:09:08.408 --> 01:09:11.344
Thank you for everything
you've done for us,

01:09:11.345 --> 01:09:13.514
for the fans,
for everybody and...

01:09:13.515 --> 01:09:15.249
<i>Justin's dedication to his fans</i>

01:09:15.250 --> 01:09:16.716
<i>and his fans' dedication to him</i>

01:09:16.716 --> 01:09:18.986
<i>is what keeps him alive I think,</i>

01:09:18.987 --> 01:09:20.920
because if he gets
too far off track,

01:09:20.921 --> 01:09:22.555
they're there to kinda
be that moral compass

01:09:22.555 --> 01:09:23.759
that brings him back always.

01:09:24.759 --> 01:09:26.894
Oh, my...
Look, how close we are.

01:09:26.895 --> 01:09:28.429
Oh, my God.

01:09:28.430 --> 01:09:31.599
It all started... It all
stemmed off from my fans

01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:33.836
showing up at
each radio station.

01:09:34.836 --> 01:09:38.906
<i>My fans posting,</i>
<i>like, video responses</i>

01:09:38.907 --> 01:09:40.241
before I was signed.

01:09:40.242 --> 01:09:43.011
It all started from the fans, so
it's gotta end up with the fans.

01:09:44.011 --> 01:09:45.411
It's all about the fans.

01:09:45.412 --> 01:09:47.247
- Thank you, Justin.
- Thank you.

01:09:47.247 --> 01:09:49.483
I might cry a little bit 'cause
that was so cute. Oh, my gosh.

01:09:49.484 --> 01:09:50.783
Look at that hairdo.

01:09:53.822 --> 01:09:56.756
<i>My music is evolving</i>
<i>'cause I'm growing up.</i>

01:09:56.757 --> 01:09:58.459
<i>My fans are</i>
<i>gonna grow up with me</i>

01:09:58.460 --> 01:10:01.661
<i>and they're gonna like my music
evolving because they're getting older.</i>

01:10:01.662 --> 01:10:05.431
And I want them to be a part
of this journey with me.

01:10:05.432 --> 01:10:07.600
<i>Songs like</i>
Believe <i> and</i> Be Alright,

01:10:07.601 --> 01:10:09.836
<i>pure acoustic, represent hope</i>

01:10:09.837 --> 01:10:12.538
<i>and represent a connection</i>

01:10:12.539 --> 01:10:13.699

01:10:30.759 --> 01:10:32.292
<i>Always ready?</i>

01:10:32.293 --> 01:10:35.032
<i>All right. Well, I gotta make

01:10:39.501 --> 01:10:40.668
<i>Safety comes first.</i>

01:10:46.807 --> 01:10:48.911
<i>Oh, you guys like safety?</i>

01:10:49.911 --> 01:10:52.315
<i>Miami must love safety.</i>

<i>Over the mountains</i>

<i>Across the sky</i>

01:11:22.743 --> 01:11:24.778
<i>Need to see your face</i>

01:11:24.779 --> 01:11:28.614

<i>My show now is super elaborate,</i>

01:12:03.685 --> 01:12:07.888
but my favorite part is literally
just the intimate moments

01:12:07.889 --> 01:12:09.689
with the fans when
I'm on that crane

01:12:09.690 --> 01:12:11.591
<i>and I'm in the crowd with them</i>

01:12:11.592 --> 01:12:13.026
<i>and I can see each</i>
<i>one of their faces,</i>

01:12:13.027 --> 01:12:14.747
<i>they're jumping up</i>
<i>and down screaming...</i>

01:12:16.064 --> 01:12:18.131
There's nothing
like that feeling.

01:12:18.132 --> 01:12:20.567
I have goose bumps
right now thinking about it,

01:12:20.568 --> 01:12:21.770
for real.

01:12:22.770 --> 01:12:25.671
<i>You know that I care for you</i>

01:12:25.672 --> 01:12:28.142

<i>I'll just stay right here</i>

01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:33.746
<i>Yeah</i>

01:12:33.747 --> 01:12:36.450
<i>I know that you want me, too</i>

01:12:36.451 --> 01:12:41.755
<i>Baby, we can make
it through anything</i>

01:12:41.756 --> 01:12:44.826
<i>And everything's

01:12:48.662 --> 01:12:50.431
<i>Be all right</i>

01:12:54.202 --> 01:12:59.672
<i>Through the long nights

01:12:59.673 --> 01:13:02.845
<i>Don't you worry</i>

01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:33.740
Yeah.

01:14:00.734 --> 01:14:01.935
Oh, my God.

01:14:03.704 --> 01:14:05.238
Yo, no, close the door.

01:14:05.239 --> 01:14:06.773
Close the doors, bro.

01:14:06.774 --> 01:14:08.841
Push the front
button down there.

01:14:08.842 --> 01:14:10.544
Where's the button?

01:14:10.545 --> 01:14:12.545
Back up!

01:14:12.546 --> 01:14:14.046
Back up, back up!

01:14:14.047 --> 01:14:15.883
Back up!

01:14:15.884 --> 01:14:17.364
Yo, watch out,
watch out, watch out.

01:14:21.088 --> 01:14:23.725
Lock the door, yo.

01:14:35.002 --> 01:14:37.872
<i>You said you wanted me</i>

01:14:38.872 --> 01:14:41.743
<i>But I said no</i>

01:14:43.211 --> 01:14:46.916
<i>'Cause all I can say is</i>

01:14:47.916 --> 01:14:49.921
<i>Please</i>

01:14:53.921 --> 01:14:54.988
<i>We have a journey.</i>

01:14:54.989 --> 01:14:57.657
<i>We have a responsibility
to our journey.</i>

01:14:57.658 --> 01:15:00.794
We must complete our journey
the best way we know how.

01:15:00.795 --> 01:15:04.230
But along the way, we have to
tell the stories of the journey.

01:15:04.231 --> 01:15:05.898
'Cause that journey, by the way,

01:15:05.899 --> 01:15:08.737
is gonna help someone
make it through their journey.

01:15:09.737 --> 01:15:12.274
<i>I need some space</i>

01:15:13.274 --> 01:15:15.841
<i>To come around you</i>

01:15:15.842 --> 01:15:19.682
<i>Around, around,</i>
<i>around, around, around</i>

01:15:21.682 --> 01:15:24.617
You know, if you're an
artist that is after fame,

01:15:24.618 --> 01:15:25.954
after money,

01:15:26.954 --> 01:15:29.156
and you achieve those things,

01:15:29.157 --> 01:15:31.591
then you have no
reason to go forward.

01:15:31.592 --> 01:15:33.859
<i>If your goals are</i>
<i>to make great music,</i>

01:15:33.860 --> 01:15:36.129
to be a better
and better singer,

01:15:36.130 --> 01:15:39.866
to be a better and
better writer every day,

01:15:39.867 --> 01:15:41.987
then that's a lifelong journey
and that doesn't end.

01:15:46.006 --> 01:15:48.647
<i>It's a weird position to be in
when you've only been winning,</i>

01:15:49.010 --> 01:15:52.278
but he doesn't really understand
what the loss looks like.

01:15:52.279 --> 01:15:54.614
That's why it's important for
him to just stay humble,

01:15:54.615 --> 01:15:56.148
stay on that humble path,

01:15:56.149 --> 01:15:59.853
because the minute
something goes wrong,

01:15:59.854 --> 01:16:02.957
everybody's gonna
try to tear him apart.

01:16:03.957 --> 01:16:08.094
You know, and he has to always
remember what got him there.

01:16:08.095 --> 01:16:09.630
You gonna get through
the whole time this time?

01:16:09.631 --> 01:16:10.631
I'll try.

01:16:11.032 --> 01:16:12.032
All right. Go ahead.

01:16:25.947 --> 01:16:29.316
Um, yeah.

01:16:29.317 --> 01:16:32.685
If I wasn't scared
that'd be a bad thing.

01:16:32.686 --> 01:16:34.153
We've had moments
over the last year

01:16:34.154 --> 01:16:36.355
where it's just been
straight yelling, screaming,

01:16:36.356 --> 01:16:38.825
tears, hugs.

01:16:38.826 --> 01:16:40.693
I mean, we're going like this
and he'll call me and be like,

01:16:40.694 --> 01:16:42.094
- "You just need to come here."
- Just come here.

01:16:42.095 --> 01:16:44.363
And you need to spend time,
you need to be around me,

01:16:44.364 --> 01:16:46.767
and I want you to be
around me 'cause I want...

01:16:46.768 --> 01:16:49.702
I want you in my life and I want
you to see what's going on.

01:16:49.703 --> 01:16:50.703
And...

01:16:50.838 --> 01:16:53.706
No, but it's always
gonna be that way,

01:16:53.707 --> 01:16:56.076
and honestly I'm a better man
because he's in my life

01:16:56.077 --> 01:16:57.678
and because I'm going through
these struggles with him.

01:16:57.679 --> 01:16:59.746
- That's so sweet...
- Thanks, man. Appreciate it.

01:16:59.747 --> 01:17:01.313
That's one of the sweetest
things you've ever said.

01:17:01.314 --> 01:17:03.416
But, you know, we're gonna
keep going through...

01:17:03.417 --> 01:17:05.117
Hey, man. Um...

01:17:05.118 --> 01:17:07.353
We're gonna keep going
through these struggles

01:17:07.354 --> 01:17:08.288
and it's not
gonna get any easier,

01:17:08.289 --> 01:17:10.891
but at the end of the day,
he's worth it.

01:17:20.134 --> 01:17:21.468
<i>You guys seem to help.</i>

01:17:21.469 --> 01:17:25.205
Believe, believe, believe.

01:17:25.206 --> 01:17:28.908
It's our last show.
Time has gone by fast.

01:17:28.909 --> 01:17:31.144
I remember thinking about
this day in the rehearsal.

01:17:31.145 --> 01:17:32.914
I can remember the first show.

01:17:33.914 --> 01:17:35.051
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

01:17:37.051 --> 01:17:40.187
Just feeling that energy
that his fans just, like,

01:17:40.188 --> 01:17:42.456
<i>give to us for the first time,</i>

01:17:42.457 --> 01:17:46.093
<i>that realization that
I'm fulfilling my dream</i>

01:17:46.094 --> 01:17:47.728
and I'll never
forget that feeling.

01:17:47.729 --> 01:17:49.429
I've always dreamed
to be a choreographer.

01:17:49.430 --> 01:17:51.965
Like, from the day
I started dancing

01:17:51.966 --> 01:17:55.268
<i>when the first show happened,</i>
<i>I sat down against a wall</i>

01:17:55.269 --> 01:17:58.205
<i>and I just, like, really</i>
<i>started crying to myself.</i>

01:17:58.206 --> 01:18:00.439
Oh, my gosh, no,
how about the audition?

01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:02.345
<i>Yeah, so no pressure, you know.</i>

01:18:04.345 --> 01:18:06.446
<i>It was so surreal.</i>
<i>It was something</i>

01:18:06.447 --> 01:18:08.180
that we had all been
working really hard towards

01:18:08.181 --> 01:18:10.250
and something we
had wanted so badly.

01:18:10.251 --> 01:18:11.585
<i>I remember being,</i>
<i>like, 10 years old</i>

01:18:11.586 --> 01:18:14.187
<i>and going to concerts and,</i>
<i>like, watching the dancer</i>

01:18:14.188 --> 01:18:16.822
and I always knew
that I wanted to do this.

01:18:16.823 --> 01:18:19.425
<i>I'm really, really grateful because
I got to dance with him on stage.</i>

01:18:19.426 --> 01:18:22.801
It's amazing and I'm so thankful
that I got the opportunity.

01:18:26.801 --> 01:18:28.969
Being right now in my home city

01:18:28.970 --> 01:18:31.103
where dancing
all started for me,

01:18:31.104 --> 01:18:32.872
<i>seeing my mom out</i>
<i>there and, like,</i>

01:18:32.873 --> 01:18:35.041
<i>thinking about how</i>
<i>much she sacrificed for me</i>

01:18:35.042 --> 01:18:36.242
<i>to do what I love to do,</i>

01:18:36.243 --> 01:18:38.077
<i>and I'm here with my boys</i>

01:18:38.078 --> 01:18:40.479
and I'm here with one of the best
artists I've ever worked with,

01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:42.984
yeah, it's amazing.
It's amazing.

01:18:43.984 --> 01:18:45.385
<i>I think that believing</i>

01:18:45.386 --> 01:18:47.520
<i>is the most powerful thing</i>
<i>that you can do in this life.</i>

01:18:47.521 --> 01:18:50.322
You can come from absolutely
nothing to something,

01:18:50.323 --> 01:18:53.059
to be standing right here,
so I think that,

01:18:53.060 --> 01:18:55.540
I'm ready to share that with the
world just like Justin does.

01:18:56.930 --> 01:19:00.066
<i>And now here we are
doing the last show.</i>

01:19:00.067 --> 01:19:02.202
Oh, my gosh.
I might cry tonight.

01:19:02.203 --> 01:19:03.536
- Oh, for sure.
- We might cry.

01:19:03.537 --> 01:19:04.618
You might see some tears.

01:19:04.971 --> 01:19:06.509
- In <i> Believe.</i>
- In <i> Believe.</i>

01:19:08.509 --> 01:19:10.443
<i>The music plays until it stops.</i>

01:19:10.444 --> 01:19:13.112
And when it does,
what have you learned

01:19:13.113 --> 01:19:15.148
and what do you believe?

01:19:15.149 --> 01:19:17.050
Do you believe this hype,

01:19:17.051 --> 01:19:19.819
<i>or are you creating</i>
<i>something greater,</i>

01:19:19.820 --> 01:19:22.589
<i>a deeper passion that will</i>

01:19:22.590 --> 01:19:25.559
<i>not only help to articulate</i>
<i>who you are as an artist,</i>

01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:29.395
<i>but also help people to be</i>
<i>able to identify with you?</i>

01:19:29.396 --> 01:19:31.965
<i>Believe</i> means,
like, be all you wanna be,

01:19:31.966 --> 01:19:33.532
do what you wanna do and don't
stop believing in yourself,

01:19:33.533 --> 01:19:34.701
just go for it.

01:19:34.702 --> 01:19:37.571
I would listen to it when I
was really upset and it was,

01:19:37.572 --> 01:19:39.853
like, I don't know, it's
just really helped me, like,

01:19:40.006 --> 01:19:41.486
pull through and,
like, not give up.

01:19:44.078 --> 01:19:46.478
<i>Justin,</i>
<i>in a lot of our car rides,</i>

01:19:46.479 --> 01:19:48.215
<i>he'd be singing in the back</i>

01:19:48.216 --> 01:19:49.381
and I'd be
telling him to shut up

01:19:49.382 --> 01:19:51.585
because he'd never stop.

01:19:51.586 --> 01:19:53.953
<i>But I didn't know this was
gonna happen obviously, right,</i>

01:19:53.954 --> 01:19:56.355
<i>so this is his life,
this is what he loves,</i>

01:19:56.356 --> 01:19:59.526
nothing's been
given to him and, yeah,

01:19:59.527 --> 01:20:00.596
I'm very proud of him.

01:20:02.596 --> 01:20:06.233
<i>I was just looking
at him the other day,</i>

01:20:06.234 --> 01:20:08.902
and he had such a baby face,
and he's my baby,

01:20:08.903 --> 01:20:11.103
and just to look at him now

01:20:11.104 --> 01:20:13.907
<i>with, like,
his little chiseled jaw</i>

01:20:13.908 --> 01:20:15.408
<i>and his attempts at facial hair.</i>

01:20:17.545 --> 01:20:19.645
He's just...
He's growing so much.

01:20:19.646 --> 01:20:22.883
<i>And as busy as he is</i>
<i>and as much as he has on him,</i>

01:20:22.884 --> 01:20:25.986
<i>he still continues to give back.</i>

01:20:25.987 --> 01:20:28.287
And, you know, as a mom and
just seeing his character grow,

01:20:28.288 --> 01:20:32.959
I think that's one of the biggest,
um, achievements, in my mind.

01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:35.663
But, Justin, I still want you
to pull your pants up.

01:20:36.183 --> 01:20:37.663
...of a night that
they can't believe.

01:20:37.664 --> 01:20:40.166
I pray that you will be
with everyone on stage,

01:20:40.167 --> 01:20:43.502
bless them all, help everyone
just to have the best show...

01:20:43.503 --> 01:20:46.505
<i>No matter what religion,
no matter what race,</i>

01:20:46.506 --> 01:20:49.011
<i>not matter what you are,
you can always believe.</i>

01:20:50.011 --> 01:20:51.243
It's all about positivity,

01:20:51.244 --> 01:20:53.015
all about believing
in something great,

01:20:54.015 --> 01:20:57.317
believing in a higher power,
believing in yourself,

01:20:57.318 --> 01:21:00.452
believing that
you can do anything

01:21:00.453 --> 01:21:01.534
if you set your mind to it.

01:21:06.661 --> 01:21:10.033
<i>I don't know how I got here</i>

01:21:12.033 --> 01:21:15.204
<i>I knew it wouldn't be easy</i>

01:21:18.204 --> 01:21:22.511
<i>But your faith in me</i>
<i>was so clear</i>

01:21:23.511 --> 01:21:25.411
<i>It didn't matter how many times</i>

01:21:25.412 --> 01:21:29.616
<i>I got knocked on the floor</i>

01:21:29.617 --> 01:21:34.657
<i>But you knew one day</i>
<i>I would be standing tall</i>

01:21:36.657 --> 01:21:39.526
<i>Just look at me now</i>

01:21:39.527 --> 01:21:42.629
<i>'Cause everything
starts from something</i>

01:21:42.630 --> 01:21:45.598
<i>But something would be nothing</i>

01:21:45.599 --> 01:21:50.471
<i>Nothing if your heart</i>
<i>didn't dream with me</i>

01:21:51.471 --> 01:21:56.380
<i>Where would I be, oh</i>

01:21:59.380 --> 01:22:02.282
<i>Where would I be</i>

01:22:02.283 --> 01:22:06.353
<i>If you didn't believe</i>

01:22:06.354 --> 01:22:07.720
<i>Would I know how it feels</i>

01:22:07.721 --> 01:22:10.322
<i>To touch the sky, yeah</i>

01:22:10.323 --> 01:22:12.157
<i>If you didn't believe</i>

01:22:12.158 --> 01:22:14.398
<i>Believe, believe</i>

01:22:17.398 --> 01:22:19.398
<i>It didn't matter how many times</i>

01:22:19.399 --> 01:22:22.671
<i>I got knocked on the floor</i>

01:22:23.671 --> 01:22:28.578
<i>But you knew one day</i>
<i>I would be standing tall</i>

01:22:30.578 --> 01:22:32.747
<i>Look at us now</i>

01:22:33.747 --> 01:22:36.549
<i>'Cause everything</i>
<i>starts from something</i>

01:22:36.550 --> 01:22:40.185
<i>But something would be nothing</i>

01:22:40.186 --> 01:22:44.559
<i>Nothing if your heart</i>
<i>didn't dream with me</i>

01:22:45.559 --> 01:22:48.661
<i>'Cause everything</i>
<i>starts from something</i>

01:22:48.662 --> 01:22:51.598
<i>But something would be nothing</i>

01:22:51.599 --> 01:22:56.371
<i>Nothing if your heart
didn't dream with me</i>

01:22:57.371 --> 01:23:00.110
<i>Where would I be</i>

01:23:04.110 --> 01:23:06.813
<i>If you didn't believe</i>

01:23:06.814 --> 01:23:10.116
<i>Where would I be, if you, if you</i>

01:23:10.117 --> 01:23:12.051
<i>If you didn't believe</i>

01:23:12.052 --> 01:23:13.685
<i>Would I know how it feels</i>

01:23:13.686 --> 01:23:16.456
<i>To touch the sky, yeah</i>

01:23:16.457 --> 01:23:18.258
<i>If you didn't believe</i>

01:23:18.259 --> 01:23:20.733
<i>Believe, believe</i>

01:23:25.733 --> 01:23:30.569
<i>Oh</i>

01:23:30.570 --> 01:23:33.840
<i>When you've reached</i>
<i>a certain point in your life,</i>

01:23:33.841 --> 01:23:38.313
<i>there are people out</i>
<i>there who sit waiting,</i>

01:23:39.313 --> 01:23:41.317
<i>wanting to see you fall.</i>

01:23:43.317 --> 01:23:47.286
<i>But rather than let</i>
<i>gravity take you down,</i>

01:23:47.287 --> 01:23:51.626
<i>sometimes you have to take</i>
<i>matters into your own hands</i>

01:23:52.626 --> 01:23:53.626
<i>and fly.</i>

01:24:33.501 --> 01:24:36.669
<i>I'm Justin Bieber.
Thank you for believing in me.</i>

01:24:36.670 --> 01:24:39.206
<i>'Cause I believe in you.</i>

01:24:51.351 --> 01:24:52.751
This was me.

01:24:52.752 --> 01:24:54.586
My pants were like this, guys.

01:24:54.587 --> 01:24:55.755
- Normal, normal.
- Higher, higher.

01:24:55.756 --> 01:24:57.724
And he said...
He said to me, he said,

01:24:57.725 --> 01:24:59.259
"You can't let
the pants wear you,

01:24:59.260 --> 01:25:00.559
"you got to
wear the pants."

01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:01.928
That's when I started sagging.

01:25:01.929 --> 01:25:03.795
- That's true. Hey...
- And that's your fault.

01:25:03.796 --> 01:25:06.398
No, listen, I will
tell you one thing though,

01:25:06.399 --> 01:25:08.367
I've lost a pair of pants,
bro, walking.

01:25:08.368 --> 01:25:09.669
- Yeah?
- Lost a pair of pants walking.

01:25:09.670 --> 01:25:10.937
No.

01:25:10.938 --> 01:25:12.371
And it's not like, you know,

01:25:12.372 --> 01:25:13.773
like, you're out at a bookstore

01:25:13.774 --> 01:25:15.175
just browsing
the nonfiction section.

01:25:15.176 --> 01:25:16.742
- Yeah.
- The nonfiction section.

01:25:16.743 --> 01:25:18.510
And your pants are
a little bit low.

01:25:18.511 --> 01:25:21.180
I'm just saying that one day,
just be careful, bro,

01:25:21.181 --> 01:25:22.715
because I've lost
a pair of pants.

01:25:22.716 --> 01:25:23.916
- Okay. I'm just saying...
- The nonfiction section...

01:25:23.917 --> 01:25:26.286
- You were the... You were the one...
- ...at Barnes & Noble.

01:25:26.287 --> 01:25:27.687
You were the one that said,

01:25:27.688 --> 01:25:29.822
"Hey, don't let
the pants wear you,

01:25:29.823 --> 01:25:31.558
- "wear the pants."
- That's right.

01:25:31.559 --> 01:25:32.858
That's why...

01:25:32.859 --> 01:25:34.794
But they... Hey...

01:25:34.795 --> 01:25:36.228
- Wear them though.
- Yeah, wear them.

01:25:36.229 --> 01:25:37.729
When they're on the ground,
bro, they're off.

01:25:37.730 --> 01:25:39.331
- Yeah, yeah.
- Nobody's wearing them.

01:26:44.664 --> 01:26:45.664
Oh, no.

01:26:54.641 --> 01:26:55.875
Smile big!

01:26:55.876 --> 01:26:56.876
One, two! Perfect, yeah.

01:27:00.514 --> 01:27:01.514
Don't cry too much.

01:27:10.623 --> 01:27:11.704
Told them he's gonna fall.

01:27:23.037 --> 01:27:26.406
<i>When I was 13,</i>
<i>I had my first love</i>

01:27:26.407 --> 01:27:27.974
<i>There was nobody</i>
<i>that compared to my baby</i>

01:27:27.975 --> 01:27:30.376
<i>And nobody came between us</i>
<i>or could ever come above</i>

01:27:30.377 --> 01:27:33.979
<i>She had me going crazy</i>
<i>oh, I was star struck</i>

01:27:33.980 --> 01:27:37.582
<i>She woke me up daily</i>
<i>don't need no Starbucks</i>

01:27:37.583 --> 01:27:39.385
<i>She made my heart pound</i>

01:27:39.386 --> 01:27:40.786
<i>It skipped a beat</i>
<i>when I see her in the street</i>

01:27:40.787 --> 01:27:42.148
<i>And at school on the playground</i>

01:27:43.023 --> 01:27:45.390
<i>But I really wanna</i>
<i>see her on the weekend</i>

01:27:45.391 --> 01:27:49.243
<i>She knows she got me dazing</i>
<i>'cause she was so amazing</i>

01:27:49.244 --> 01:27:51.811
<i>And now my heart is breaking</i>
<i>but I just keep on saying...</i>

01:28:04.811 --> 01:28:05.811
Hi.

01:28:22.563 --> 01:28:23.912
Oh!

01:28:38.912 --> 01:28:40.783
Does this look like
I'm walking downstairs?

01:28:43.783 --> 01:28:45.451
<i>My man, Ludacris, everybody.</i>

01:28:45.452 --> 01:28:46.824
<i>Give it up for Ludacris!</i>
