00:13.990 --> 00:16.990

sites.

00:17.830 --> 00:19.990
After Julia revealed the twin

00:19.990 --> 00:21.290
twist to Vanessa.

00:21.290 --> 00:21.990
>> Is it true?

00:21.990 --> 00:22.990
>> It's true.

00:22.990 --> 00:24.120
>> I'm freaking out.

00:24.120 --> 00:26.990
>> The poker player rallied the

00:26.990 --> 00:27.990
troops to protect the twins.

00:27.990 --> 00:30.990

00:30.990 --> 00:32.990
I get to help Liz and Julia.

00:32.990 --> 00:35.700
>> And a new power alliance was

00:35.700 --> 00:35.990
formed.

00:35.990 --> 00:38.830
>> This could be called the

00:38.830 --> 00:39.950
6th sense!

00:39.950 --> 00:41.700
It's good, right?

00:41.700 --> 00:42.990

00:42.990 --> 00:44.990
he was on to the twins.

00:44.990 --> 00:47.990

00:47.990 --> 00:52.830
>> Neferl putting himself in the

00:52.830 --> 00:52.990
choke hold.

00:52.990 --> 00:56.990
>> If he keeps pressing this

00:56.990 --> 00:57.990
Julia thing it's making him a

00:57.990 --> 00:58.830
bigger target.

00:58.830 --> 01:00.990
>> With her sites set on James

01:00.990 --> 01:02.990
and Jeff, Vanessa need add pawn

01:06.990 --> 01:07.000
to do it.

01:07.000 --> 01:11.990
>> So the comp thrower Johnny

01:11.990 --> 01:13.990

01:21.990 --> 01:22.000
pawns.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000

01:24.000 --> 01:26.990

01:34.990 --> 01:37.990

01:37.990 --> 01:38.990
was a fish out of water.

01:38.990 --> 01:40.990
>> I love fishing of but I do

01:40.990 --> 01:42.990
not like fishing for clothes.

01:42.990 --> 01:43.990
Making John's job easy.

01:43.990 --> 01:47.990
>> My partner's lack of skill is

01:47.990 --> 01:49.950
just throwing this competition

01:49.950 --> 01:50.700
for me.

01:50.700 --> 01:52.990
I just get to sit there and

01:52.990 --> 01:52.990
watch.

01:52.990 --> 01:57.990
>> And helping expheg Jason b.C.

02:05.950 --> 02:06.990
>> With Austin dethroned with

02:06.990 --> 02:09.950
Vanessa target James or Jeff?

02:09.950 --> 02:11.990
And tonight will the veto screw

02:11.990 --> 02:14.990
up her master plan?

02:14.990 --> 02:16.990
But another surprise for the

02:16.990 --> 02:17.950
houseguest.

02:17.950 --> 02:21.990
>> Any time he calls me to a

02:21.990 --> 02:23.990
party, you must go and do what

he says.

03:12.830 --> 03:12.990
♪ of.

03:12.990 --> 03:13.990
>> Ok.

03:13.990 --> 03:15.990
I'm going upstairs.

03:15.990 --> 03:17.830
I have to shower.

03:17.830 --> 03:19.990
>> All right, boys.

03:19.990 --> 03:21.410
>> Sorry.

03:21.410 --> 03:22.990
Not sorry, boys.

03:22.990 --> 03:23.990
Like you would have been happy

03:23.990 --> 03:26.990
to have us sit up on the block

03:26.990 --> 03:30.990
all week and you relax.

03:30.990 --> 03:31.990
Enjoy being nominated.

03:31.990 --> 03:33.990
>> That wasn't even a

03:33.990 --> 03:33.990
competition.

03:33.990 --> 03:36.990
>> I just said to her, we worked

03:36.990 --> 03:37.290
them.

03:37.290 --> 03:39.990
>> This is good.

03:39.990 --> 03:41.990
We're good.

03:41.990 --> 03:45.990
Jeff thinks we're best borrows.

03:45.990 --> 03:46.990
Jeff or James?

03:46.990 --> 03:48.990
>> The whole house wants Audrey

03:48.990 --> 03:50.830
gone but that is not what is

03:50.830 --> 03:51.990
best for me.

03:51.990 --> 03:53.410
I was Jeff or James.

03:53.410 --> 03:54.990
I need to send one of them

03:54.990 --> 03:56.290
packing without pissing off the

03:56.290 --> 03:57.290
rest of the house.

03:57.290 --> 03:59.290
>> Only one of them is going to

03:59.290 --> 04:01.990
survive and they're great

04:01.990 --> 04:02.990
competitors and I'm going to

04:02.990 --> 04:06.990
have a competitor gunning for

04:06.990 --> 04:06.990
me.

04:06.990 --> 04:10.990
>>

04:10.990 --> 04:14.120
>> James is throwing it.

04:14.120 --> 04:15.990
>> I don't think so.

04:15.990 --> 04:17.990
I think he was legitimately

04:17.990 --> 04:18.990
terrible at it.

04:18.990 --> 04:19.990
>> That was really bad.

04:19.990 --> 04:22.990
>> No, he is like oh, I mess

04:22.990 --> 04:23.990
dizzy that's that up.

04:23.990 --> 04:24.120
I'm sorry.

04:24.120 --> 04:26.950
>> Every squeek like groundhog's

04:26.950 --> 04:26.990
day.

04:26.990 --> 04:29.000
I wake up, hey, John, guess

04:29.000 --> 04:31.990
what, you're nominated!

04:31.990 --> 04:32.000
Yay!

04:32.000 --> 04:33.990
And you get to throw the battle

04:33.990 --> 04:35.990
of the block, awesome.

04:35.990 --> 04:38.990
And you have to try to win --

04:38.990 --> 04:39.990
ok, this is great.

04:39.990 --> 04:41.990
This keeps happening over and

04:41.990 --> 04:44.990
over again.

04:44.990 --> 04:51.990
>>

04:51.990 --> 04:52.990
>> it was tough, man.

04:52.990 --> 04:53.990
That was a tough call.

04:53.990 --> 04:56.990
You pretty much had to have a

04:56.990 --> 04:58.990
real keen eye to be like, ok, I

04:58.990 --> 05:00.990
know what pattern that is.

05:00.990 --> 05:02.990
And that was not -- it was made

05:02.990 --> 05:04.990
for girls, not made for us.

05:04.990 --> 05:05.990
>> Yes.

05:05.990 --> 05:07.990
>> Don't worry about it.

05:07.990 --> 05:09.990
We know what is going to happen.

05:09.990 --> 05:10.990
>> Your guys are fine.

05:10.990 --> 05:12.990
>> I didn't understand why y'all

05:12.990 --> 05:14.120
were stressing so much.

05:14.120 --> 05:16.540
>> So we didn't win the battle

05:16.540 --> 05:17.410
of the block.

05:17.410 --> 05:18.990
It suction but it's ok because

05:18.990 --> 05:19.990
we have a plan.

05:19.990 --> 05:22.990
We're going to go try to primary

05:22.990 --> 05:24.990
target which is Audrey, a back

05:24.990 --> 05:25.120
door situation.

05:25.120 --> 05:26.990
I'm not worried right now.

05:26.990 --> 05:27.990
You know what?

05:27.990 --> 05:28.990
I take that back.

05:28.990 --> 05:31.990
I'm worried until Audrey is up

05:31.990 --> 05:34.990
on the block.

05:34.990 --> 05:38.000
>> I would rather be sitting

05:38.000 --> 05:46.410
next to Audrey.

05:46.410 --> 05:53.990
>> Hey?

05:53.990 --> 05:57.540
Jeff and James, are they on?

05:57.540 --> 05:57.990
>> No.

05:57.990 --> 05:58.990
>> Not at all?

05:58.990 --> 05:59.000
>> Not.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.950
>> Completely not.

06:00.950 --> 06:01.990
>> Completely.

06:01.990 --> 06:07.990
>> Who do you want to go?

06:07.990 --> 06:10.990
>> Jeff.

06:10.990 --> 06:12.990
>> Jeff or James I.

06:12.990 --> 06:15.830
>> I have so decide which one.

06:15.830 --> 06:19.540
One involves keeping someone

06:19.540 --> 06:21.990
safe and -- honestly like he is

06:21.990 --> 06:22.990
good at everything.

06:22.990 --> 06:25.700
So if it's threatening, he has a

06:25.700 --> 06:28.990
30% chance to win hoh every

06:28.990 --> 06:31.990
week so I'm in big time by

06:31.990 --> 06:32.990
letting him back in the field

06:32.990 --> 06:34.990
and that is what makes me

06:34.990 --> 06:35.290
scared.

06:35.290 --> 06:36.990
>> The safest best is to send

06:36.990 --> 06:37.830
James home.

06:37.830 --> 06:39.990
>> I want to get out this week

06:39.990 --> 06:41.990
with as little blood on my hands

06:41.990 --> 06:41.990
as responsible.

06:41.990 --> 06:43.990
I think keeping James on the

06:43.990 --> 06:45.990
block and keeping the

06:45.990 --> 06:47.000
nominations the same is the best

06:47.000 --> 06:49.700
way to do it.

06:49.700 --> 06:51.990
>> I still see Jeff as a bigger

06:51.990 --> 06:54.290
target but she is hoh so I'm

06:54.290 --> 06:55.990
going to have to go along with

06:55.990 --> 06:56.950
it.

06:56.950 --> 06:59.990
>> Listen, if you have plan b,

06:59.990 --> 07:19.990
let me know.

07:19.990 --> 07:21.290
>> It's ok.

07:21.290 --> 07:23.990
It's all in the plan.

07:23.990 --> 07:25.990
>> You are really introverted in

07:25.990 --> 07:26.990
the house.

07:26.990 --> 07:28.990
You have to try to be me.

07:28.990 --> 07:30.990
You're not playing you.

07:30.990 --> 07:31.120
You're being me.

07:31.120 --> 07:32.410
>> I know.

07:32.410 --> 07:35.990
I know it's hard for you but you

07:35.990 --> 07:37.990
have to be bubbly.

07:37.990 --> 07:39.990
>> I act the same.

07:39.990 --> 07:42.410
Are you being like a dumb blond?

07:42.410 --> 07:43.990
I'm not going to pretend to act

07:43.990 --> 07:43.990
like that.

07:43.990 --> 07:45.000
>> You have to.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.120
I'm not a dumb blond but I don't

07:47.120 --> 07:49.950
know, whatever you think bubbly

07:49.950 --> 07:49.990
means, I don't know.

07:49.990 --> 07:54.990
>> Out of all cost cover your

07:54.990 --> 07:54.990
tooth.

07:54.990 --> 07:58.990
Everyone is looking for the

07:58.990 --> 08:10.990
tooth.

08:10.990 --> 08:13.990
>> You don't have lotion up

08:13.990 --> 08:13.990
here?

08:13.990 --> 08:14.990
>> No lotion up here.

08:14.990 --> 08:16.990
>> I'm probably the biggest

08:16.990 --> 08:16.990
target.

08:16.990 --> 08:18.990
I want to check in with Vanessa

08:18.990 --> 08:20.990
just to ensure that she's still

08:20.990 --> 08:22.990
good about me and to know for

08:22.990 --> 08:25.000
sure, she is not going to back

08:25.000 --> 08:26.830
door me in this week.

08:26.830 --> 08:27.990
>> Everything good on your end.

08:27.990 --> 08:29.990
>> Yeah.

08:29.990 --> 08:30.990
>>

08:30.990 --> 08:32.990
>> you have nothing to worry

08:32.990 --> 08:33.990
about.

08:33.990 --> 08:35.290
>> Like nothing to worry about.

08:35.290 --> 08:36.990
I'm actually praying you get

08:36.990 --> 08:37.410
picked.

08:37.410 --> 08:39.950
>> It's a gamble but keeping

08:39.950 --> 08:40.990
Audrey is good for our game.

08:40.990 --> 08:42.990
Vanessa and I have bigger fish

08:42.990 --> 08:43.990
to fry with Jeff and James.

08:43.990 --> 08:45.990
We're thinking we can keep

08:45.990 --> 08:47.990
Audrey close for now, let her

08:47.990 --> 08:49.830
think she is working with us and

08:49.830 --> 08:49.990
deal with her later.

08:49.990 --> 08:52.990
>> If you actually won the veto

08:52.990 --> 08:54.990
that would be best case scenario

08:54.990 --> 08:56.700
because it's not our fault.

08:56.700 --> 08:58.990
She didn't portray.

08:58.990 --> 09:00.990
>> You are not my enemy.

09:00.990 --> 09:01.990
You are my friend.

09:20.990 --> 09:21.990
>> Hello.

09:21.990 --> 09:23.950
>> Are you sleeping up here or

09:23.950 --> 09:23.990
no.

09:23.990 --> 09:24.830
>> For sure.

09:24.830 --> 09:25.990
>> I want Johnny mack to pick

09:25.990 --> 09:27.000
meal or you.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.990
>> Let's get in there.

09:28.990 --> 09:30.990
>> Audrey, let's hope she

09:30.990 --> 09:31.990
doesn't get a chip.

09:31.990 --> 09:32.990
>> It's perfect!

09:32.990 --> 09:34.990
It is.

09:34.990 --> 09:36.990
>> I trust her.

09:36.990 --> 09:38.000
But she's been honest with me.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.990
She has her own thing she wants

09:39.990 --> 09:43.000
to do and has been vehement with

09:43.000 --> 09:45.990
me like this is how it's going

09:45.990 --> 09:47.990
to work and this is what we have

09:47.990 --> 09:49.990
to do to get Audrey out.

09:49.990 --> 09:51.990
You and me and James, we could

09:51.990 --> 09:52.700
run this.

09:52.700 --> 09:56.990
But the problem is, dude, Clay

09:56.990 --> 09:57.990
is like --

09:57.990 --> 10:00.990
>> but Shelli is --

10:00.990 --> 10:04.410
>> do you want to take her out?

10:04.410 --> 10:07.990
>> Oh, yes.

10:07.990 --> 10:11.990
>> What's up?

10:11.990 --> 10:18.990
>>

10:18.990 --> 10:21.990
>> I'm waiting 0 to see what

10:21.990 --> 10:22.990
happens in a couple of days.

>> Here is Jeff again running

10:24.990 --> 10:28.990
his mouth and not knowing what

10:28.990 --> 10:29.990
people's relationships are.

10:29.990 --> 10:31.990
You're digging your own grave.

10:31.990 --> 10:35.990
>> She's great.

10:35.990 --> 10:37.990
>> Hey, everybody, it's time to

10:37.990 --> 10:39.990
pick players for the veto

10:39.990 --> 10:41.990
competition.

10:41.990 --> 10:47.990

10:49.990 --> 10:51.990
participate in the veto

competition, the head of

10:52.990 --> 10:54.290
household, the nominees and slow

10:54.290 --> 10:56.990
other players selected by random

10:56.990 --> 10:56.990
draw.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.540
Had the nominees please join me

10:59.540 --> 11:02.990
up here.

11:02.990 --> 11:04.990
I, as head of household, and the

11:04.990 --> 11:06.290
two nominees will each pull a

11:06.290 --> 11:07.990
chip out of the box to determine

11:07.990 --> 11:08.990
the three other players

11:08.990 --> 11:10.990
competing in the veto

11:10.990 --> 11:11.000
competition.

11:11.000 --> 11:16.410
As hoh I will pick first.

11:16.410 --> 11:18.830
I really need the nominations to

11:18.830 --> 11:20.990
stay the same so I'm hoping

11:20.990 --> 11:22.990
Audrey gets picked with some

11:22.990 --> 11:24.990
combination of Austin, Shelli

11:24.990 --> 11:26.700
and Clay because I know they

11:26.700 --> 11:28.990
will keep the nominations the

11:28.990 --> 11:28.990
same.

11:28.990 --> 11:31.990
>> And the lucky winner is

11:31.990 --> 11:31.990
Shelli.

11:35.950 --> 11:36.830
>> Ok.

11:36.830 --> 11:38.990
>> The plan is to back door

11:38.990 --> 11:40.410
Audrey this week so when I'm

11:40.410 --> 11:41.990
picking names out of the box it

11:41.990 --> 11:43.990
doesn't matter who I pick as

11:43.990 --> 11:45.990
long as it's not Audrey because

11:45.990 --> 11:46.990
everyone seems to be on board

11:46.990 --> 11:47.990
with the plan.

11:47.990 --> 11:53.990
>> Houseguest's choice.

11:53.990 --> 12:01.990
I will choose Austin.

12:01.990 --> 12:04.290
>> Trying to do a back door

12:04.290 --> 12:06.990
situation which is awe dree.

12:06.990 --> 12:07.990
So it's very important we don't

12:07.990 --> 12:09.120
draw her name.

12:09.120 --> 12:11.990
And I start to pull out the chip

12:11.990 --> 12:13.990
and I slowly look at it and my

12:13.990 --> 12:17.990
worst fears have came true --

12:17.990 --> 12:22.990
Audrey.

12:22.990 --> 12:23.700
Ughh!

12:23.700 --> 12:24.990
Of course she gets chosen.

12:24.990 --> 12:29.990
I am mortified.

12:29.990 --> 12:31.120
>> "Big Brother" will inform us

12:31.120 --> 12:33.990
when the competition is to

12:33.990 --> 12:33.990
begin.

12:33.990 --> 12:36.990
Best case scenario Audrey wins

12:36.990 --> 12:38.990
and keeps nomination the same.

12:38.990 --> 12:40.990
If that doesn't happen hopefully

12:40.990 --> 12:43.290
myself or Shelli or Austin can

12:43.290 --> 12:45.990
pull out a victory so the

12:45.990 --> 12:46.990
nominees can't pull themselves

12:46.990 --> 12:47.990
off the block.

12:47.990 --> 13:01.990
Good luck.

13:01.990 --> 13:03.990
>> Audrey needs to recognize

13:03.990 --> 13:05.410
when she comes up to the hoh

13:05.410 --> 13:07.540
room she puts a bigger target on

13:07.540 --> 13:08.990
her back and makes people

13:08.990 --> 13:09.990
realize that we're working

13:09.990 --> 13:09.990
together.

13:15.990 --> 13:17.990
he did not want to come out of

13:17.990 --> 13:19.410
that box.

13:19.410 --> 13:21.990
>> I know.

13:21.990 --> 13:26.990
>> We are going to try throw it

13:26.990 --> 13:27.990
to you and I don't want everyone

13:27.990 --> 13:30.990
to think we're collaborating.

13:30.990 --> 13:32.290
I'm never going to put you up.

13:32.290 --> 13:33.990
>> I know that.

13:33.990 --> 13:34.990
Are you sure?

13:34.990 --> 13:36.540
>> I don't want to have actual

13:36.540 --> 13:36.990
blood on my hands.

13:36.990 --> 13:40.000
>> Right now I'm feeling pretty

13:40.000 --> 13:40.990
good.

13:40.990 --> 13:41.990
Vanessa and Austin and Shelli

13:41.990 --> 13:43.990
are going to throw the veto

13:43.990 --> 13:45.540
because it would guarantee my

13:45.540 --> 13:47.830
safety and James would get sent

13:47.830 --> 13:47.990
home packing.

13:47.990 --> 14:05.990
>> For sure if I win, don't even
--

14:05.990 --> 14:10.830
>> watch out there and I see the

14:10.830 --> 14:11.990
two giant dice and I'm like oh,

14:11.990 --> 14:14.000
my God this is totally my

14:14.000 --> 14:14.990
competition.

14:14.990 --> 14:16.990
I'm gambling my life in this

14:16.990 --> 14:18.990
game, like every single week I'm

14:18.990 --> 14:19.990
a pawn.

14:19.990 --> 14:21.990
I have been doing this for three

14:21.990 --> 14:25.410
weeks all right, so let's do it!

14:25.410 --> 14:28.990
>> The only thing gronk loves

14:28.990 --> 14:31.990
more than a foam party is a

14:31.990 --> 14:31.990
Vegas party.

14:31.990 --> 14:33.990
Here is how it works.

14:33.990 --> 14:34.990
A random draw determines what

14:34.990 --> 14:36.990
order you will be playing n the

14:36.990 --> 14:37.990
player that draws the first

14:37.990 --> 14:38.990
position will step up and

14:38.990 --> 14:40.990
challenge one of the other

14:40.990 --> 14:45.990
players in a head-to-head drop

14:45.990 --> 14:46.990
and roll match.

14:46.990 --> 14:48.990
Each player will get inside of

14:48.990 --> 14:49.990
their giant dice.

14:49.990 --> 14:51.990
I will spin the wheel to

14:51.990 --> 14:52.990
determine which number you will

14:52.990 --> 14:54.540
try to match.

14:54.540 --> 14:56.290
When the bell rings roll your

14:56.290 --> 14:57.700
dice off the platform with the

14:57.700 --> 14:58.540
goal of returning to your

14:58.540 --> 14:59.540
platform with the correct number

14:59.540 --> 15:02.990
on the top of your die.

15:02.990 --> 15:03.990
The first player with the

15:03.990 --> 15:06.290
correct number up stays in the

15:06.290 --> 15:07.990
game but loser is eliminated.

15:07.990 --> 15:09.990
The next player in line will

15:09.990 --> 15:10.990
then step up and challenge any

15:10.990 --> 15:12.990
of the players still in the

15:12.990 --> 15:12.990
game.

15:12.990 --> 15:14.830
This will continue until only

15:14.830 --> 15:16.540
one player remains earning them

15:16.540 --> 15:18.990
the power of veto.

15:18.990 --> 15:23.120
>> Who is ready to rock'n'roll?

15:23.120 --> 15:27.990
>> Vanessa, you are up first who

15:27.990 --> 15:28.990
would you like to challenge?

15:28.990 --> 15:30.950
>> Audrey.

15:30.950 --> 15:31.990
>> It's round one.

15:31.990 --> 15:32.990
I have to pick Audrey.

15:32.990 --> 15:34.120
The rest of the house thinks

15:34.120 --> 15:36.990
that I'm trying to back door

15:36.990 --> 15:37.000
her.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.830
In actuality I'm picking her so

15:38.830 --> 15:39.990
I can throw it to her.

15:39.990 --> 15:42.990
>> And the number you're going

15:42.990 --> 15:46.990
for is ... 2.

15:49.990 --> 15:51.990
your platform and win with a 2

15:51.990 --> 15:53.990
is --

16:05.540 --> 16:06.990
number from the wheel on top of

17:02.990 --> 17:05.700
The plan is to back door Audrey

alliance is sitting pretty

19:47.700 --> 19:49.000
getting James out of the house.

19:56.990 --> 19:58.990
>> Goliath come on up.

19:58.990 --> 20:00.990
>> I'm not sure it's in my best

20:00.990 --> 20:01.990
interest to win.

20:01.990 --> 20:03.990
Austin is in my alliance so I'm

20:03.990 --> 20:05.990
going to let Austin do this one.

20:05.990 --> 20:07.990
>> The number you're going for

20:22.990 --> 20:24.990
trade and yoga guru at nighttime

20:24.990 --> 20:27.990
and I found the best way to move

20:27.990 --> 20:29.990
this die is by frogging it

20:29.990 --> 20:33.990
around like a big old frog.

20:33.990 --> 20:36.990
>> Oh, my God.

20:36.990 --> 20:41.990
>>

20:41.990 --> 20:42.990
>> congratulations, Austin.

20:42.990 --> 20:45.990
You have won the match.

20:45.990 --> 20:48.000
I'm sorry, Shelli, you have been

20:48.000 --> 20:48.990
eliminated.

20:48.990 --> 20:48.990
All right.

20:48.990 --> 20:50.990
We are down to our final round.

20:50.990 --> 20:52.990
It all comes down to this.

Who will win the power of veto?

20:55.410 --> 20:57.830
>> Austin said I'm safe but I

20:57.830 --> 20:59.830
need to win this for myself,

20:59.830 --> 21:00.990
just to know that I'm

21:00.990 --> 21:01.990
100 percent safe this week.

21:01.990 --> 21:04.990
>> The number you are going for

21:04.990 --> 21:08.120
in the find gronk and roll match

21:10.990 --> 21:11.990
Johnny mack and I need Austin to

21:30.990 --> 21:32.830

21:32.830 --> 21:34.120
round right now I'm starting to

21:34.120 --> 21:35.990
think maybe I shouldn't win.

21:35.990 --> 21:37.830
I know that Vanessa is counting

21:37.830 --> 21:39.990
on me to win this veto, however

21:39.990 --> 21:40.700
holding that power of veto may

21:40.700 --> 21:41.990
not be in my best interest.

21:41.990 --> 21:44.990
Do I go through with this now

21:44.990 --> 21:46.990
and win the competition tore do

21:46.990 --> 21:51.990
I play for Judas?

22:05.950 --> 22:07.990
>> How has it been?

22:07.990 --> 22:09.290
I haven't seen you in about a

22:09.290 --> 22:09.990
week.

22:09.990 --> 22:09.990
>> Pretty good.

22:09.990 --> 22:11.990
The power of veto, I do whatever

22:11.990 --> 22:12.000
the hell I want.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.990
>> Me too man.

22:13.990 --> 22:14.990
It looks like we will be hanging

22:14.990 --> 22:16.990
out a lot this summer.

22:16.990 --> 22:19.990
>> Hell, yeah, man, let's do it.

22:20.990 --> 22:21.990
>> John won power of veto.

22:21.990 --> 22:24.990
I couldn't be any happier.

22:24.990 --> 22:26.990
The ball is in Vanessa's court.

22:26.990 --> 22:27.990
We just have to make sure she

22:27.990 --> 22:30.410
does the right thing.

22:30.410 --> 22:32.990
>> Austin, what did you do?

22:32.990 --> 22:34.990
You just totally jeopardized all

22:34.990 --> 22:36.990
of our plans and now I'm in a

22:36.990 --> 22:37.990
position I didn't think I was

22:37.990 --> 22:38.990
going to have to be in.

Be a fly in the wallk inside the

>> Did you like it?

23:05.120 --> 23:06.990
>> It was kind of fun but

23:06.990 --> 23:07.990
confusing.

23:07.990 --> 23:08.990
So you think you have the number

23:08.990 --> 23:10.000
right and then you're oh, it's

23:10.000 --> 23:10.990
brack ward.

23:10.990 --> 23:12.990
So I stopped and that one second

23:12.990 --> 23:13.410
cost me.

23:13.410 --> 23:14.990
>> Good job, Mr. mack.

>> Thank you.

23:16.990 --> 23:19.700
>> I'm tired of being pawned,

23:19.700 --> 23:21.000

out there for everyone else.

23:22.990 --> 23:24.990
Like work with me or get ready

>> Oh, dude.

23:31.990 --> 23:33.950
I'm so glad.

23:33.950 --> 23:35.990
I did not want to be up on the

23:35.990 --> 23:38.120
block with you.

23:38.120 --> 23:41.990
>> Oh, mack, mack, mack.

23:41.990 --> 23:44.990
>> I knew once Audrey was

23:44.990 --> 23:45.990
knocked out I was like I'm not

23:45.990 --> 23:47.990
worried about it.

23:47.990 --> 23:48.990
It's just have fun.

23:48.990 --> 23:51.990
>> You're sitting in the house

23:51.990 --> 23:52.990
with 13 other money hungry

23:52.990 --> 23:54.990
people, the point you feel too

23:54.990 --> 23:55.990
safe you're probably going home.

23:55.990 --> 23:57.990
You might want to start giving

23:57.990 --> 23:59.830
it a little bit more of an

23:59.830 --> 23:59.990
effort.

23:59.990 --> 24:01.290
>> You took her out.

24:01.290 --> 24:02.990
Man, it was like we were all

24:02.990 --> 24:05.990
having fun then.

24:05.990 --> 24:09.990
>>

24:09.990 --> 24:11.990
>> that's ok though.

24:11.990 --> 24:13.990
>> It's great.

24:13.990 --> 24:16.990
Are you kidding me?

24:16.990 --> 24:18.990
>> Should I have won it or

24:18.990 --> 24:21.540
should I let him win it.

24:21.540 --> 24:26.990
>> I hate it but you're never

24:26.990 --> 24:27.990
going to try to convince me you

24:27.990 --> 24:28.990
didn't try to throw that.

24:28.990 --> 24:29.990
>> I did try.

24:29.990 --> 24:30.990
>> Are you kidding me?

24:30.990 --> 24:33.700
>> I swear I didn't try to throw

24:33.700 --> 24:33.990
it.

24:33.990 --> 24:34.990
>> You must think I'm stupid.

24:34.990 --> 24:36.990
>> I didn't try to throw it.

24:36.990 --> 24:38.990
>> You're never going to

24:38.990 --> 24:39.990
convince me of that.

24:39.990 --> 24:41.990
>> I never did.

24:41.990 --> 24:43.700
>> I didn't throw it!

24:43.700 --> 24:45.990
>> I'm not lying.

24:45.990 --> 24:47.990
Once it was me and Johnny mack I

24:47.990 --> 24:49.990
didn't know if I should let him

24:49.990 --> 24:49.990
win it or not.

24:49.990 --> 24:53.700
>> How could you possibly be

24:53.700 --> 24:54.950
confused.

24:54.950 --> 24:56.990
I could not be more confused.

24:56.990 --> 25:00.830
I want James out and as little

25:00.830 --> 25:02.990
as possible blood on my hands.

25:02.990 --> 25:05.990
And you want Jeff out and --

25:05.990 --> 25:07.540
>> Vanessa, that's not what

25:07.540 --> 25:07.990
happened.

25:07.990 --> 25:07.990
>> I don't know.

25:07.990 --> 25:09.990
>> I finished James up when I

25:09.990 --> 25:11.120
had the chance to beat him.

25:11.120 --> 25:12.950
I couldn't particular it out.

25:12.950 --> 25:14.990
>> Then what did you do,

25:14.990 --> 25:15.990
suddenly forget our entire

25:15.990 --> 25:15.990
conversation.

25:15.990 --> 25:16.990
>> No, I didn't.

25:16.990 --> 25:18.700
I was going for the win and he

25:18.700 --> 25:19.990
got there right before he.

25:19.990 --> 25:21.990
I was going to go on the

25:21.990 --> 25:21.990
platform.

25:21.990 --> 25:22.990
>> Keep your voice low.

25:22.990 --> 25:23.990
>> I'm sorry.

25:23.990 --> 25:25.410
I wasn't like that though.

25:25.410 --> 25:29.990
>> Oh, my God!

25:29.990 --> 25:32.990
>> You are the one person I was

25:32.990 --> 25:34.410
counting on and it's like,

25:34.410 --> 25:34.990
whatever.

25:34.990 --> 25:37.990
>> Vanessa, I was not trying --

25:37.990 --> 25:40.990
I'm telling you that was not my

25:40.990 --> 25:40.990
intention.

25:40.990 --> 25:42.990
I wasn't going -- I was trying

25:42.990 --> 25:42.990
to slow down.

25:42.990 --> 25:46.540
I was looking like a beast and

25:46.540 --> 25:47.990
afraid I was doing too well.

25:47.990 --> 25:49.990
>> I think I convinced the house

25:49.990 --> 25:52.700
I was trying to beat Johnny mack

25:52.700 --> 25:53.990
in the final round however the

25:53.990 --> 25:55.830
one person I need convince is

25:55.830 --> 25:55.990
Vanessa.

25:55.990 --> 25:57.990
If she thinks I was throwing

25:57.990 --> 25:59.990
this thing she might start

25:59.990 --> 26:01.990
doubting our relationship.

26:01.990 --> 26:03.990
>> When you play with someone

26:03.990 --> 26:03.990
all the time --

26:03.990 --> 26:06.000
>> I'm not lying to you.

26:06.000 --> 26:06.990
Stop me.

26:06.990 --> 26:08.990
>> You're not going to throw

26:08.990 --> 26:09.990
things to intimidate me.

26:09.990 --> 26:11.990
>> I'm not trying to intimidate

26:11.990 --> 26:12.990
you.

26:12.990 --> 26:15.540
I'm trying to tell you the

26:15.540 --> 26:15.990
truth.

26:15.990 --> 26:17.700
Oh, my God.

26:17.700 --> 26:19.830
>>

26:19.830 --> 26:21.830
>> we just had a conversation --

26:21.830 --> 26:23.990
>> I hate when people don't

26:23.990 --> 26:24.990
believe what I'm say.

26:24.990 --> 26:26.990
>> I hate when people don't do

26:26.990 --> 26:30.990
what they're supposed to do.

26:30.990 --> 26:32.990
If you want to calm me down I

26:32.990 --> 26:34.700
need you to explain to me how

26:34.700 --> 26:37.410
you have a sudden memory lapse.

26:37.410 --> 26:37.990
>> I'm sorry.

26:37.990 --> 26:39.990
Now what do you want to do?

26:39.990 --> 26:40.290
>> I don't know.

26:40.290 --> 26:41.290
I have to make a decision.

26:50.990 --> 26:51.990
>> Everybody can you gather in

26:51.990 --> 26:52.990
the living room?

26:52.990 --> 26:57.120
>> Oh, my God, party!

26:57.120 --> 27:00.990
>> As everyone knows, gronk said

27:00.990 --> 27:01.990
no have-nots this week.

27:01.990 --> 27:03.990
But the party is about to kick

27:03.990 --> 27:05.990
into high gear.

27:05.990 --> 27:07.990
Any time gronk calls you to a

27:07.990 --> 27:09.990
party you must go and do what he

27:09.990 --> 27:10.990
says.

27:10.990 --> 27:12.990
If you don't show up, that's a

27:12.990 --> 27:14.290
party foul, and that will make

27:14.290 --> 27:19.990
you a have not for the week.

27:19.990 --> 27:20.990
So show up!

27:20.990 --> 27:24.990
And don't disappoint gronk.

27:24.990 --> 27:26.990
>> I love it, I love it.

27:26.990 --> 27:29.700
>> There's no have-nots this

27:29.700 --> 27:31.000
week which I'm pumped about

27:31.000 --> 27:32.830
because being a have not last

27:32.830 --> 27:32.990
week was all of.

27:32.990 --> 27:34.990
Instead we have parties and I

27:34.990 --> 27:36.830
have a feeling we're going to do

27:36.830 --> 27:37.990
a lot of crazy things.

27:37.990 --> 27:39.990
>> It's party time!

27:39.990 --> 27:42.990
>> Guys, everyone go back to

27:42.990 --> 27:51.540
your naps.

27:51.540 --> 27:54.990
>> It's time for a toga party.

27:54.990 --> 27:56.990
Grab your toga and party in the

27:56.990 --> 27:56.990
living room.

27:56.990 --> 28:01.830
>> Doesn't to dance?

28:01.830 --> 28:02.990
Dance in the living room.

28:02.990 --> 28:05.990
>> Go, go, go!

28:05.990 --> 28:10.000
>> All right!

28:10.000 --> 28:11.410
That's a party!

28:11.410 --> 28:12.950
See you soon.

28:12.950 --> 28:17.990
>> That was a killer party!

28:17.990 --> 28:19.990
>> Pool party, everyone get in

28:19.990 --> 28:21.990
your suits and head to the pool

28:21.990 --> 28:21.990
for a good time.

28:21.990 --> 28:24.000
>> I was just like in the pool

28:24.000 --> 28:24.990
anyway.

28:24.990 --> 28:26.990
>> I'm loving this take over

28:26.990 --> 28:28.990
this week with the gronk them

28:28.990 --> 28:29.990
and the party them.

28:29.990 --> 28:31.830
A party is a party and I'm

28:31.830 --> 28:34.990
definitely all for it.

28:34.990 --> 28:40.990
>> Yeah!

28:40.990 --> 28:42.990
>> You know what sounds good?

28:42.990 --> 28:42.990
Shower party.

28:42.990 --> 28:44.990
Everyone in the shower and let's

28:44.990 --> 28:44.990
party.

28:44.990 --> 28:51.990
>> In the shower?

28:51.990 --> 28:53.990
>> You're partying in and you

28:53.990 --> 28:55.990
end up in the shower with 14

28:55.990 --> 28:57.290
other people and you're the only

28:57.290 --> 28:59.990
one with a hoodie on and you're

28:59.990 --> 29:02.950
like, this is awkward.

29:02.950 --> 29:03.990
>> New year's Eve party?

29:03.990 --> 29:05.990
Get up and party in the living

29:05.990 --> 29:05.990
room.

29:05.990 --> 29:07.990
>> Party.

29:07.990 --> 29:10.990
>> Party, party, party!

29:10.990 --> 29:13.700
>> It's midnight.

29:13.700 --> 29:17.990
Get some work done!

29:17.990 --> 29:22.990
>>

29:22.990 --> 29:25.990
>> did you just kiss on the

29:25.990 --> 29:25.990
lips.

29:25.990 --> 29:26.990
>> We might have.

29:26.990 --> 29:28.990
Do you want to see it again?

29:28.990 --> 29:31.990
>> Party, party!

29:31.990 --> 29:34.990
>> What time is it?

29:34.990 --> 29:35.990
Grok o'clock and that means it's

29:35.990 --> 29:40.990
time to party.

29:40.990 --> 29:41.990
>>

29:41.990 --> 29:44.990
>> gronk's takeover means party

29:44.990 --> 29:46.990
all the time.

29:46.990 --> 29:50.410
Whether we are sleeping --

29:50.410 --> 29:52.990
>> sleeping?

29:52.990 --> 29:53.990
That's a party.

29:53.990 --> 29:55.120
Get up and get rowdy.

29:55.120 --> 29:56.990
>> Cooking dinner --

29:56.990 --> 29:57.990
>> kitchen party!

29:57.990 --> 30:00.700
>> I was just dancing in the

30:00.700 --> 30:00.990
kitchen.

30:00.990 --> 30:02.290
>> And no matter how much we

30:02.290 --> 30:05.990
hate each other this week we all

30:05.990 --> 30:07.830
come together and we're dancing.

30:07.830 --> 30:08.990
>> Everybody limbo.

30:08.990 --> 30:09.120
>> Limbo?

30:09.120 --> 30:11.290
>> You can't stop partying yet.

30:11.290 --> 30:13.540
>> Sometimes we're miserable.

30:13.540 --> 30:15.990
>> Congo party.

30:15.990 --> 30:20.990
Give me 50 party laps.

30:20.990 --> 30:27.990
>> Ouch, ouch, ouch!

30:27.990 --> 30:33.990
>> Get on your bikini and board

30:33.990 --> 30:35.990
shorts and get to the hot

30:35.990 --> 30:36.990
tub now.

30:36.990 --> 30:38.950
>> Party!

30:38.950 --> 30:41.990
>> Ok, gronk.

30:41.990 --> 30:45.990
This party sucks.

30:45.990 --> 30:48.990
>> Come on.

30:48.990 --> 30:50.990
>> Whas'sup?

30:50.990 --> 30:53.990
>> Nothing.

30:53.990 --> 30:56.990
>> I haven't had a chat with you

30:56.990 --> 30:58.950
ever since veto and he

30:58.950 --> 30:59.000
everything is happening and I

30:59.000 --> 31:01.120
want to see where your head is

31:01.120 --> 31:01.990
at.

31:01.990 --> 31:04.950
>> Let me talk to him.

31:04.950 --> 31:09.700
Let me talk to you all, really.

31:09.700 --> 31:09.990
Ok.

31:09.990 --> 31:09.990
--

31:09.990 --> 31:14.990
>> I just I would see where your

31:14.990 --> 31:15.990
mind is at.

31:15.990 --> 31:18.410
>> I'm struggling a little bit

31:18.410 --> 31:19.990
because, like, I want to do the

31:19.990 --> 31:20.990
right thing for myself.

31:20.990 --> 31:22.990
I also want to make as many

31:22.990 --> 31:24.990
people happy as possible.

31:24.990 --> 31:27.990
I also don't would I do anything

31:27.990 --> 31:27.990
wrong.

31:27.990 --> 31:30.990
When I say wrong, I mean like,

31:30.990 --> 31:32.990
I'm a champion for courses, like

31:32.990 --> 31:35.950
what Audrey represents in being

31:35.950 --> 31:35.990
here.

31:35.990 --> 31:37.540
Like imagine how that Bo look.

31:37.540 --> 31:39.950
>> But her name has been

31:39.950 --> 31:40.990
attached to any kind of drama

31:40.990 --> 31:42.990
that has existed in this house

31:42.990 --> 31:43.990
since day one.

31:43.990 --> 31:45.990
So you can either send somebody

31:45.990 --> 31:48.990
home who is basically going to

31:48.990 --> 31:50.990
get no blood on your hands who

31:50.990 --> 31:51.990
100 percent has wronged people

31:51.990 --> 31:53.830
in the house, she really has --

31:53.830 --> 31:56.990
>> this is a very big moment for

31:56.990 --> 31:56.990
me.

31:56.990 --> 31:58.990
>> If not her, who are you going

31:58.990 --> 31:59.990
to pick.

31:59.990 --> 32:01.990
>> I know you're friend with

32:01.990 --> 32:02.990
James but I have an opportunity

32:02.990 --> 32:04.990
to take him out this week.

32:04.990 --> 32:06.990
>> Hey, buddy.

32:06.990 --> 32:08.990
>> I'm pretty convinced that

32:08.990 --> 32:10.990
Audrey is not going up.

32:10.990 --> 32:13.540
It is literally mind boggling

32:13.540 --> 32:15.990
that she wants to get rid of

32:15.990 --> 32:16.290
James.

32:16.290 --> 32:17.990
Vanessa was handed over, one of

32:17.990 --> 32:19.990
the easiest hoh's ever.

32:19.990 --> 32:22.120
She had a playbook to go by and

32:22.120 --> 32:24.990
she's like, hey, let's just wing

32:24.990 --> 32:25.990
it.

32:25.990 --> 32:27.990
Screw the playbook and let's do

32:27.990 --> 32:30.990
something random.

32:30.990 --> 32:35.830
>> Like she is brain washed.

32:35.830 --> 32:35.990
She wants James gone.

32:35.990 --> 32:38.990
>> They are releasing Audrey

32:38.990 --> 32:40.990
isn't going to be back doored.

32:40.990 --> 32:42.990
I already knew that so I have to

32:42.990 --> 32:44.000
play dumb to protect myself and

32:44.000 --> 32:45.990
protect Shelli as well.

32:45.990 --> 32:51.540
>> I'm so on with having Audrey

32:51.540 --> 32:51.990
gone from the house.

32:51.990 --> 32:53.000
>> Everybody is.

32:53.000 --> 32:55.990
But this is exhibit a.

32:55.990 --> 32:57.120
Audrey brain washed yet another

32:57.120 --> 32:58.990
person in the house -- she's

32:58.990 --> 33:00.410
going to put an innocent person

33:00.410 --> 33:01.990
next to James and what is going

33:01.990 --> 33:03.830
to happen James is it going to

33:03.830 --> 33:05.410
stay and someone sells going

33:05.410 --> 33:05.990
home.

33:05.990 --> 33:08.990
>> All right, guys.

33:08.990 --> 33:09.990
>> Are we upstairs.

33:09.990 --> 33:11.950
>> I'm not going to lie.

33:11.950 --> 33:13.990
The conversation I had was not

33:13.990 --> 33:13.990
good.

33:13.990 --> 33:15.990
It was not good.

33:15.990 --> 33:23.000
Obviously for you.

33:23.000 --> 33:28.990
>> Dude, since when has

33:28.990 --> 33:29.990
Vanessa's focus on getting

33:29.990 --> 33:31.120
Audrey out shifted from Audrey

33:31.120 --> 33:35.990
to James?

33:35.990 --> 33:36.990
>> Oh, boy.

33:36.990 --> 33:37.990
>> She's overthinking

33:37.990 --> 33:38.290
everything.

33:38.290 --> 33:39.990
>> She really is.

33:39.990 --> 33:41.990
>> I'll go talk to her.

33:41.990 --> 33:42.540
>> Geez.

33:42.540 --> 33:44.410
>> I'll go up there and try to

33:44.410 --> 33:46.990
figure it out.

33:46.990 --> 33:47.990
Geez.

33:47.990 --> 33:48.290
Oh, mylanta.

33:48.290 --> 33:50.410
>> It's not even about that.

33:50.410 --> 33:51.990
It sickens me.

33:51.990 --> 33:52.990
>> He's lying.

33:52.990 --> 33:54.000
He knew he was a target.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.830
I read it in his eyes.

33:55.830 --> 33:56.990
>> These people are not that

33:56.990 --> 33:57.990
great at lying.

33:57.990 --> 33:59.990
The minute you said supposedly

33:59.990 --> 34:01.990
now it switched to James, his

34:01.990 --> 34:03.990
eyes said "really?"

34:03.990 --> 34:06.540
And his pupils said "I know

34:06.540 --> 34:06.990
that."

34:06.990 --> 34:09.990
>> Austin's highs looked like an

34:09.990 --> 34:10.990
11-year-old boy that just broke

34:10.990 --> 34:12.990
the window and doesn't want to

34:12.990 --> 34:13.990
tell his mom.

34:13.990 --> 34:15.990
Like come on honey.

34:15.990 --> 34:17.540
This shows it was all a ruse all

34:17.540 --> 34:20.990
week and Austin is for sure in

34:20.990 --> 34:21.990
an alions with answer.

34:21.990 --> 34:22.990
>> He knew that already.

34:22.990 --> 34:33.990
>> Hold it!

34:33.990 --> 34:34.990
>> Dude --

34:34.990 --> 34:37.990
>> look, between me and you,

34:37.990 --> 34:40.990
deud Austin has a lot of pull.

34:40.990 --> 34:42.700
He's going to have to go, dude,

34:42.700 --> 34:43.990
very soon.

34:43.990 --> 34:44.990
Like people already have radar

34:44.990 --> 34:46.990
on him.

34:46.990 --> 34:48.990
He is not trustworthy.

34:48.990 --> 34:52.700
He is not good for either of our

34:52.700 --> 34:54.990
teams, dude.

34:54.990 --> 34:56.990
You will not say a word about

34:56.990 --> 34:57.990
it.

34:57.990 --> 35:00.990
>> Dude I swear, if they throw

35:00.990 --> 35:02.990
me up, we're going to have to go

35:02.990 --> 35:07.990
to war.

35:07.990 --> 35:10.990
>> People are starting to act

35:10.990 --> 35:10.990
weird.

35:10.990 --> 35:14.990
He just gave us the ammo.

35:14.990 --> 35:17.990
>> He is saying you're acting

35:17.990 --> 35:18.990
weird.

35:18.990 --> 35:19.990
>> He's trying to three me under

35:19.990 --> 35:20.700
the bus.

35:20.700 --> 35:21.990
>> We will talk tomorrow for

35:21.990 --> 35:21.990
sure.

35:21.990 --> 35:22.990
>> This is my chance.

35:22.990 --> 35:24.990
I have the ammunition I need to

35:24.990 --> 35:26.990
confront Jeff, catch him in his

35:26.990 --> 35:28.990
lies and give Vanessa a reason

35:28.990 --> 35:31.700
to put him on the block.

35:31.700 --> 35:35.950
>> Clay just came in and told me

35:35.950 --> 35:37.990
Austin is acting weird, I think

35:37.990 --> 35:38.990
she doing something, we can't

35:38.990 --> 35:41.700
work with him, just threw me

35:41.700 --> 35:41.990
under the bus.

35:41.990 --> 35:43.990
>> You need to call Jeff out.

35:43.990 --> 35:44.540
Go do it.

35:44.540 --> 35:45.540
What are you waiting for.

35:45.540 --> 35:46.990
>> We have to give Vanessa what

35:46.990 --> 35:48.990
she needs to put him up.

35:48.990 --> 35:53.990
>> Has he talked that cray to

35:53.990 --> 35:53.990
you?

35:53.990 --> 35:54.950
>> Yes.

35:54.950 --> 35:55.990
>> Put him under the bus with

35:55.990 --> 35:56.950
that.

35:56.950 --> 35:58.290
>> The whole house wants Audrey

35:58.290 --> 36:00.950
out but I need an excuse to put

36:00.950 --> 36:01.700
someone else.

36:01.700 --> 36:03.990
Jeff would be the perfect

36:03.990 --> 36:04.990
replacement nominee and I have

36:04.990 --> 36:06.990
all of the operation I need.

36:06.990 --> 36:07.990
Time for operation Jeff.

36:07.990 --> 36:09.990
We will hit him so the whole

36:09.990 --> 36:10.950
house will understand.

36:10.950 --> 36:17.120
This is my chance.

36:17.120 --> 36:19.830
>> Dude, are you throwing me

36:19.830 --> 36:20.990
under the bus?

36:20.990 --> 36:23.990
>> Like have you been outing me

36:23.990 --> 36:25.830
in the past couple of weeks

36:25.830 --> 36:25.990
behind my back.

36:25.990 --> 36:28.990
People are coming up now, Jeff

36:28.990 --> 36:29.990
doesn't have your best interest

36:29.990 --> 36:30.990
at heart.

36:30.990 --> 36:32.990
And I'm like, am I a fool.

36:32.990 --> 36:34.990
>> Why would I throw you under

36:34.990 --> 36:34.990
the bus.

36:34.990 --> 36:36.290
I don't know.

36:36.290 --> 36:38.990
All I thought we were boys.

36:38.990 --> 36:40.990
And Austin has to go next,

36:40.990 --> 36:45.830
that's what Vanessa has been

36:45.830 --> 36:45.990
hearing.

36:45.990 --> 36:48.990
>> You told me thaty can't trust

36:48.990 --> 36:51.830
Clay and Shelli is out of the

36:51.830 --> 36:51.990
picture.

36:51.990 --> 36:56.990
>> What the hell?

36:56.990 --> 36:59.950
>> Because I'm hearing multiple

36:59.950 --> 37:02.540
things and I want to know why my

37:02.540 --> 37:03.540
name is being dragged in the

37:03.540 --> 37:03.990
mud.

37:03.990 --> 37:05.700
>> No one is dragging your name

37:05.700 --> 37:05.990
in the mud.

37:05.990 --> 37:07.990
>> You're saying this right now.

37:07.990 --> 37:08.990
That's not a lie.

37:08.990 --> 37:10.990
>> This is insanity.

37:10.990 --> 37:12.950
>> I have three people all mad

37:12.950 --> 37:13.540
at me.

37:13.540 --> 37:15.700
I have Clay and Shelli looking

37:15.700 --> 37:18.990
at me like I legit just killed

37:18.990 --> 37:18.990
their pet dog.

37:18.990 --> 37:20.990
>> I don't even know what you're

37:20.990 --> 37:20.990
talking about.

37:20.990 --> 37:26.990
>> Really?

37:26.990 --> 37:31.990
>> You can come in.

37:31.990 --> 37:32.990
I just I would know what is true

37:32.990 --> 37:33.990
and not true.

37:33.990 --> 37:35.990
>> Austin, no one is dragging

37:35.990 --> 37:36.990
your name through the mud.

37:36.990 --> 37:38.990
>> You never said Austin is a

37:38.990 --> 37:38.990
target for you.

37:38.990 --> 37:40.990
>> No.

37:40.990 --> 37:42.990
>> You said Shelli is a target

37:42.990 --> 37:43.990
for you.

37:43.990 --> 37:44.990
>> Have you said you can't work

37:44.990 --> 37:45.990
with Shelli and Clay as a

37:45.990 --> 37:48.990
couple?

37:48.990 --> 37:50.990
>> You did, dude.

37:50.990 --> 37:51.990
I'm not a liar.

37:51.990 --> 37:53.990
I will put my hand on the Bible.

37:53.990 --> 37:55.990
>> Put your hand on the Bible.

37:55.990 --> 37:57.990
>> You're going to sit there --

37:57.990 --> 37:59.990
oh, my God you must be like

37:59.990 --> 38:00.990
silly.

38:00.990 --> 38:06.990
Don't you dare -- you know what?

38:06.990 --> 38:07.990
Have fun.

38:07.990 --> 38:08.990
That's it.

38:08.990 --> 38:10.700
You're a liar.

38:10.700 --> 38:12.990
Right to my face!

38:12.990 --> 38:13.950
I don't know why he would say

38:13.950 --> 38:14.540
that to me.

38:14.540 --> 38:16.120
You want to make up lines about

38:16.120 --> 38:17.120
me I will put you on blast.

38:28.990 --> 38:38.990
>> Get ready for a takeover!

38:38.990 --> 38:42.990
>> Hey, guys, as you know I'm a

38:42.990 --> 38:43.990
super bowl champion so I love

38:43.990 --> 38:45.990
people willing to win at all

38:45.990 --> 38:46.990
cost.

38:46.990 --> 38:48.120
So if you want a competition you

38:48.120 --> 38:50.990
will have a chance to go on

38:50.990 --> 38:51.990
gronk's partyship.

38:51.990 --> 38:53.990
You and a friend get on ocean

38:53.990 --> 38:56.990
view cabin on the craziest

38:56.990 --> 38:59.950
cruise ever, with me and my

38:59.950 --> 39:00.990
family for three days in January

39:00.990 --> 39:03.990
as we travel from Miami to the

39:03.990 --> 39:04.540
Bahamas.

39:04.540 --> 39:06.990
So he's going to set sail with

39:06.990 --> 39:07.990
captain chronic?

39:07.990 --> 39:09.990
Get to the back yard and find

39:09.990 --> 39:10.410
out.

39:10.410 --> 39:11.990
Good luck!

39:11.990 --> 39:14.990
>> The gronk says that the

39:14.990 --> 39:15.990
winners are going to get a

39:15.990 --> 39:16.990
prize.

39:16.990 --> 39:19.830
So the two battle of the block

39:19.830 --> 39:20.990
winners, the two hoh winners

39:20.990 --> 39:22.990
and the one veto winner are

39:22.990 --> 39:24.990
invited to a luxury comp.

39:24.990 --> 39:26.990
>> Before you are five party

39:26.990 --> 39:27.990
cups.

39:27.990 --> 39:30.990
Only one has a winning chip that

39:30.990 --> 39:33.830
will bring you passage to the

39:33.830 --> 39:35.990
craziest party on the high seas.

39:35.990 --> 39:37.990
So chug your drink and see who

39:37.990 --> 39:40.990
will be the lucky one to sail on

39:40.990 --> 39:42.990
gronk's party ship.

39:42.990 --> 39:59.990
Ready, set, chug!

39:59.990 --> 40:02.990
>> Yes, yes, yes, yes!

40:02.990 --> 40:06.990
I have just won the cruise who

40:06.990 --> 40:07.120
the gronk.

40:07.120 --> 40:09.000
I am to excited.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.830
Hot boys and partying -- who

40:11.830 --> 40:12.990
else better to win this

40:12.990 --> 40:13.990
competition?

40:13.990 --> 40:15.990
>> Making without with gronk,

40:15.990 --> 40:27.990
man!

40:27.990 --> 40:30.990
>> Ok, everybody, time for the

40:30.990 --> 40:43.990
veto meeting.

40:43.990 --> 40:46.990
>> This is the veto meeting.

40:46.990 --> 40:49.700
James and I have been nominated

40:49.700 --> 40:50.990
for eviction.

40:50.990 --> 40:53.990
But I have the power to veto one

40:53.990 --> 40:56.990
of the nominations.

40:56.990 --> 40:58.990
>> Get up and party in the

40:58.990 --> 41:02.990
living room --

41:02.990 --> 41:03.990
>> gronk.

41:03.990 --> 41:05.990
>> Hey!

41:05.990 --> 41:09.990
>> Yeah!

41:09.990 --> 41:11.700
>> Oh, my God he's going to see

41:11.700 --> 41:11.990
us.

41:11.990 --> 41:14.000
>> It's horrible.

41:14.000 --> 41:18.990
>> I have decided to use the

41:18.990 --> 41:22.990
power of veto to save myself.

41:22.990 --> 41:24.990
Since I have just vetoed one of

41:24.990 --> 41:25.990
your nominations you will have

41:25.990 --> 41:30.990
to choose a replacement nominee.

41:30.990 --> 41:33.990
>> Until recently this person

41:33.990 --> 41:35.990
wasn't even on my radar,

41:35.990 --> 41:36.990
unfortunately over the last few

41:36.990 --> 41:37.990
days information has come to

41:37.990 --> 41:39.990
light and events have unfolded

41:39.990 --> 41:42.990
that I simply can't ignore.

41:42.990 --> 41:45.540
And Jeff, when you lie to a room

41:45.540 --> 41:49.990
full of people at my expense you

41:49.990 --> 41:52.990
took a screen at my integrity

41:52.990 --> 41:53.990
crossing those lines.

41:53.990 --> 41:57.990
Please take a seat.

41:57.990 --> 41:59.990
>> This veto meeting is

41:59.990 --> 42:09.990
adjourned.

42:09.990 --> 42:10.990
>>

42:10.990 --> 42:12.990
>> this was something that came

42:12.990 --> 42:14.990
out of complete left field.

42:14.990 --> 42:17.990
I'm very frustrated and annoyed.

42:17.990 --> 42:18.000
Congratulations.

42:18.000 --> 42:19.990
You're playing a weak game.

42:19.990 --> 42:21.290
I know deep down you think this

42:21.290 --> 42:23.990
is a power move and that this is

42:23.990 --> 42:25.990
super strategic and you're being

42:25.990 --> 42:27.950
a super competative player but

42:27.950 --> 42:29.990
at the end of the day you're

42:29.990 --> 42:30.990
Audrey's little puppet.

42:30.990 --> 42:32.990
>> Jeff has been my target all

42:32.990 --> 42:34.990
along and now he's on the block,

42:34.990 --> 42:37.290
Judas is going to come out this

42:37.290 --> 42:39.410
week without any blood on his

42:39.410 --> 42:39.990
hands!

42:39.990 --> 42:42.990
>> For the past few weeks I hit

42:42.990 --> 42:43.990
rock bomb.

42:43.990 --> 42:45.990
I am moving on up.

42:45.990 --> 42:48.990
Watch out, houseguests!

42:48.990 --> 42:50.950
>> Announcer: Who will be

42:50.950 --> 42:51.990
evicted from the "Big Brother"

42:51.990 --> 42:51.990
house?

42:51.990 --> 42:52.990
James or Jeff?

42:52.990 --> 42:54.990
And the power is up for grabs in

42:54.990 --> 42:56.990
an all new battle for head of

42:56.990 --> 42:57.990
household.

42:57.990 --> 43:00.990
It all happens live, tomorrow at

43:00.990 --> 43:01.990
9:00, 8:00 central on "big

43:01.990 --> 43:02.990
brother."
