44:35.172 --> 44:35.756
Mom?

44:36.840 --> 44:38.467
You need to redirect.

44:42.179 --> 44:43.889
Mom, please redirect.

45:22.344 --> 45:23.262
Object to form.

50:40.537 --> 50:43.457
Could you tell me a little about
you and your wife's relationship?

50:43.540 --> 50:45.375
You know, it's like any marriage.

50:45.459 --> 50:46.418
You've got your ups and downs.

50:46.501 --> 50:50.130
And sure, you're not gonna
agree on everything, you know?

50:50.213 --> 50:52.966
Do you guys ever disagree on Maya's care?

50:53.050 --> 50:55.343
No, and I know my wife.

50:55.427 --> 50:59.639
She'll stay up till three in the morning,
you know, doing research or whatever.

50:59.723 --> 51:03.935
I kind of listen to what she says
with that and the doctors.

51:04.019 --> 51:06.354
Number one is the doctors.

51:06.438 --> 51:10.317
Is Maya looking for some attention
from her mom?

51:10.400 --> 51:11.735
Trying to please her mom?

51:11.818 --> 51:12.778
Mom wants her to be sick,

51:12.861 --> 51:14.613
-so I'm going to be sick to please my mom.
-I hope not.

51:14.696 --> 51:16.073
God, I hope not.

51:19.326 --> 51:24.790
Let's not differentiate love and affection
and caring for abuse.

51:24.873 --> 51:26.083
Because they can happen in tandem.

51:26.166 --> 51:27.000
Yeah.

51:27.709 --> 51:31.046
I don't agree with her on a lot of things,
but I'll tell you what,

51:31.129 --> 51:33.757
intentionally, she would never
hurt her children.

51:34.257 --> 51:36.593
I'd swear on my life on that one.

51:37.427 --> 51:38.595
Do you love your wife?

51:38.678 --> 51:39.971
I love her, yeah.

51:40.555 --> 51:41.389
I just…

51:42.724 --> 51:44.935
She is a pushy person

51:45.018 --> 51:46.978
and it's getting worse right now.

51:47.062 --> 51:50.023
Just, you know,
she don't want to cooperate.

51:51.733 --> 51:53.151
This is a complicated case.

51:54.194 --> 51:57.823
And I think it could be very possible

51:57.906 --> 51:59.741
that someone could be looking
at criminal charges.

52:01.576 --> 52:04.663
Which is why I'm asking you,
are you protective or are you complicit?

52:05.455 --> 52:06.790
Protective of my children.

52:08.250 --> 52:10.293
Are your children
truly your first priority?

52:10.377 --> 52:13.380
I swear on my life,
on my children's lives.

52:13.463 --> 52:15.924
I don't care, I'll put you
and your wife in jail tomorrow

52:16.007 --> 52:17.509
-if it meant Maya stays better.
-If I did something wrong,

52:17.592 --> 52:18.510
you'd put me in jail.

52:18.593 --> 52:20.804
-Absolutely.
-Yes, I accept that.

52:22.430 --> 52:24.891
Let me ask you.
If Maya was released tomorrow

52:24.975 --> 52:27.310
would you be compliant

52:27.394 --> 52:30.897
if that child was not to have
any contact with her mother?

52:31.523 --> 52:32.440
Yes.

52:34.151 --> 52:35.193
In a heartbeat.

01:00:02.515 --> 01:00:03.766
Oh, my God!

01:00:05.059 --> 01:00:06.811
I'm so sorry.

01:00:11.232 --> 01:00:12.233
I'm so sorry…

01:00:12.775 --> 01:00:15.737
I feel so bad, the judge was so cold.

01:33:38.696 --> 01:33:40.197
Heartless bastards.

01:33:42.867 --> 01:33:45.119
They're just going
to continue to beat us up.

01:33:48.331 --> 01:33:49.665
They don't give a shit.

01:33:50.833 --> 01:33:53.753
Please stop talking?
I don't want to hear it anymore.
