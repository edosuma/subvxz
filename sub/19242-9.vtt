WEBVTT

00:57.474 --> 00:58.308
Mine.

01:01.561 --> 01:03.772
How can she be so lovely?

01:06.733 --> 01:07.984
I have to go to work.

01:11.696 --> 01:12.614
Just a minute.

01:14.532 --> 01:15.575
Where's mine?

01:16.868 --> 01:17.994
Here she is!

01:20.288 --> 01:21.122
So pretty!

01:22.540 --> 01:23.458
I'll be back.

01:24.417 --> 01:25.251
Wait a minute.

01:26.169 --> 01:27.545
Where did mine go?

01:27.629 --> 01:29.756
Here I am!

01:30.840 --> 01:32.217
Were... were you awake?

01:33.510 --> 01:34.427
Come here.

01:34.511 --> 01:36.471
But I have to go to work now.

01:40.141 --> 01:42.102
Come here.

01:44.437 --> 01:45.522
I'm here.

01:50.026 --> 01:50.860
I'm here.

01:51.694 --> 01:52.821
What should we do now?

01:54.322 --> 01:55.156
I like you.

01:56.658 --> 01:57.575
I like you more.

01:58.701 --> 01:59.828
I like mornings.

02:01.329 --> 02:03.039
I wish it was morning all the time.

02:04.749 --> 02:06.417
But I liked night time too.

02:23.685 --> 02:26.062
Is it okay to stay in bed like this?

02:26.688 --> 02:27.939
Your mom is upstairs.

02:28.773 --> 02:31.776
It wouldn't be nice to wake her.
We should be nice.

02:33.486 --> 02:35.113
Let her sleep in.

02:35.572 --> 02:36.406
Okay.

02:40.410 --> 02:41.911
I'm curious about something.

02:42.453 --> 02:43.288
What?

02:46.791 --> 02:50.086
When did you decide
that you wanted to marry me?

02:52.672 --> 02:53.506
Well...

02:54.799 --> 02:55.967
I just fell for you.

02:59.512 --> 03:00.346
Then...

03:01.556 --> 03:03.308
why did you end up marrying me?

03:03.391 --> 03:05.768
That's the same question.
Ask the next question.

03:06.561 --> 03:08.021
I've always been curious.

03:08.479 --> 03:10.607
I'll get up
if you don't have another question.

03:10.690 --> 03:11.983
Okay.

03:13.359 --> 03:14.944
I'll hear the answer

03:15.695 --> 03:17.280
on our first anniversary.

03:20.283 --> 03:26.331
If I hadn't pursued you first yesterday,
would we have separate rooms forever?

03:27.916 --> 03:30.543
You brought up that strange plant ,
Mimosa or whatever.

03:32.879 --> 03:34.756
I didn't know how you were feeling.

03:35.965 --> 03:37.508
Even if we live together forever,

03:38.843 --> 03:39.928
I will probably...

03:41.179 --> 03:42.931
never know everything you're feeling.

03:45.808 --> 03:48.311
Youre considerate,
and I like all of that.

03:49.520 --> 03:52.982
You should add a wild side there.

03:54.192 --> 03:56.653
If you add a slight bit of that,

03:57.403 --> 03:58.988
I think it would be great.

03:59.697 --> 04:01.699
What do you mean it would be great?

04:02.408 --> 04:03.826
If my wild side comes out,

04:04.661 --> 04:06.246
you wouldn't be able to handle it.

04:07.622 --> 04:09.165
I am a total animal.

04:14.128 --> 04:15.129
I feel so shy.

04:15.463 --> 04:16.297
Me too.

04:20.343 --> 04:22.011
I keep needing to confirm it.

04:22.971 --> 04:23.805
What?

04:27.642 --> 04:29.560
That you like me,

04:30.728 --> 04:32.730
that you're not getting tired of me.

04:35.191 --> 04:37.068
That I still excite you.

04:41.281 --> 04:42.573
Just don't change.

04:45.618 --> 04:48.162
I like you more and more every day.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.541
So make sure you don't change.

04:55.295 --> 04:56.838
I won't change.

04:58.548 --> 04:59.841
-Really?
-Yeah.

05:00.049 --> 05:02.927
My personality is like that.

05:09.309 --> 05:10.810
I slept as if I were in my bed.

05:15.398 --> 05:17.400
This place suits me well.

05:21.446 --> 05:22.697
Put on my socks.

05:25.908 --> 05:26.743
Oh, my.

05:28.202 --> 05:29.579
Why did this fall out here?

05:30.163 --> 05:31.581
-Oh, no!
-Mom!

05:32.707 --> 05:34.000
Breakfast is ready.

05:34.751 --> 05:35.668
Yes.

05:37.211 --> 05:38.296
What are you doing?

05:38.880 --> 05:39.714
What?

05:40.673 --> 05:41.924
Did you sleep on the floor?

05:42.008 --> 05:43.051
Oh, I must have.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.678
I'm so used to sleeping on the floor.

05:46.387 --> 05:48.014
You must have rolled off the bed.

05:48.097 --> 05:50.099
Oh, it's so nice!

05:50.266 --> 05:52.268
Get up. So-joon's making breakfast.

05:52.560 --> 05:54.062
-What's with you?
-Hold on.

05:54.187 --> 05:56.272
My shoulder bone isn't set quite right.

05:57.315 --> 05:59.233
I need to set this shoulder bone.

05:59.650 --> 06:01.110
You should just go back down.

06:01.402 --> 06:03.613
Don't make So-joon do it all.
Go on downstairs.

06:04.113 --> 06:04.947
All right.

06:05.114 --> 06:07.116
-Oh, my shoulder.
-Fix it and come down.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.409
-Okay.
-Oh, Mom...

06:09.786 --> 06:11.788
I think I need to work
on my hop bone too.

06:12.413 --> 06:13.706
Fix that, then.

06:14.791 --> 06:16.250
Do I look funny?

06:17.377 --> 06:18.628
If I do this, it works.

06:35.645 --> 06:36.562
This looks pretty.

06:37.438 --> 06:39.816
So-joon seems like a good person,

06:40.316 --> 06:41.317
the more I see him.

06:42.235 --> 06:44.695
You should get re-married
to a man like him.

06:44.904 --> 06:45.738
What?

06:45.988 --> 06:47.323
Live with a man again?

06:48.282 --> 06:53.579
For me, men are just people
I meet for fun.

06:53.830 --> 06:55.915
I have so many men
that follow me around.

07:00.086 --> 07:03.339
By the way,
do you remember what your dad looks like?

07:05.299 --> 07:06.259
Why, all of a sudden?

07:07.427 --> 07:10.847
You're the one who got rid
of all his pictures and all traces of him.

07:11.889 --> 07:16.102
That was because I thought
you might miss him and get hurt.

07:16.269 --> 07:18.646
You did the right thing.
I don't remember him.

07:19.355 --> 07:20.481
I'm not even curious.

07:23.860 --> 07:25.319
Would you like to meet him once?

07:25.695 --> 07:26.612
Should we find him?

07:28.030 --> 07:30.616
Why? Do you still have feelings for him?

07:30.700 --> 07:32.076
No!

07:33.161 --> 07:38.291
I just want to let him know
how well you're doing.

07:39.834 --> 07:42.962
He left us with a pile of debt
and never contacted us.

07:43.588 --> 07:45.548
That means
he's not curious about us at all.

07:46.132 --> 07:47.508
That means he doesn't miss us.

07:49.385 --> 07:50.219
All right.

07:51.804 --> 07:53.764
Sometimes, you are so naive.

07:54.223 --> 07:57.768
Forget about me.
You suffered so much because of him.

07:57.852 --> 07:59.479
All right! I got it!

07:59.729 --> 08:00.563
Sorry.

08:01.814 --> 08:02.732
I mean,

08:03.566 --> 08:09.780
the chairman hardly attends meetings.
I get that.

08:10.698 --> 08:11.532
Hey!

08:12.158 --> 08:15.536
Why isn't Director Kim Yong-jin
here today? Why?

08:15.703 --> 08:18.414
It's happened so many times lately.
What's with him?

08:18.498 --> 08:21.834
I told you already.
He has a meeting with investors--

08:21.918 --> 08:26.839
Why would he book a meeting
during my project presentation?

08:26.964 --> 08:28.090
Is he screwing with me?

08:28.174 --> 08:30.551
Why don't we discuss it first?

08:31.010 --> 08:32.512
I looked over your plan.

08:32.678 --> 08:36.224
Sanmi seems to be more profitable
for a rental business than land purchase.

08:38.434 --> 08:41.812
Don't you think Director Kim Yong-jin
has been acting strange lately?

08:42.688 --> 08:44.273
He seems very busy lately.

08:45.441 --> 08:47.860
I don't know if I should bring this up.

08:49.529 --> 08:52.031
There are rumors
that he's pulling investors from here.

08:52.114 --> 08:54.951
There are rumors
that he's still looking into Jangho.

08:55.243 --> 08:56.869
We decided not to invest in Jangho.

08:57.286 --> 08:59.830
That's why I'm saying it's strange.

09:00.748 --> 09:04.335
He must be working on something
on his own.

09:04.418 --> 09:05.503
I doubt that.

09:06.045 --> 09:07.838
That could cause legal issues.

09:08.089 --> 09:09.298
Who would do such a thing?

09:10.174 --> 09:11.008
Right?

09:12.134 --> 09:14.303
That's a bit much even for false rumors.

09:20.851 --> 09:21.852
Where are you going?

09:22.311 --> 09:23.271
The restroom?

09:28.693 --> 09:31.737
<i>If I save the CCTV footage in here,</i>

09:31.821 --> 09:34.198
<i>you're going to go to the future</i>
<i>to see it?</i>

09:35.658 --> 09:38.619
I can see the filmed footage here.

09:40.955 --> 09:42.373
Let me see.

09:50.131 --> 09:53.009
It feels weird to sit here in comfort
and watch the other world.

09:55.303 --> 09:57.054
Should I get started then?

10:30.755 --> 10:32.298
Gosh, seriously.

10:33.466 --> 10:35.593
How am I supposed to get through
all of this?

10:41.641 --> 10:42.892
What is Ma-rin doing?

10:45.853 --> 10:46.979
<i>What are you doing?</i>

10:48.314 --> 10:50.066
You just need to act natural.

10:50.608 --> 10:52.068
Oh, really?

10:52.360 --> 10:53.611
I am being natural.

10:53.694 --> 10:56.113
Can you act like I'm not here? Just relax.

10:56.197 --> 10:57.073
Just relax.

10:59.241 --> 11:02.328
Come on. That isn't natural at all.

11:03.704 --> 11:04.580
What was that?

11:04.664 --> 11:07.667
Unfortunately, that was a little cheesy.

11:07.750 --> 11:09.710
I guess he wants to look good
for the photo.

11:09.794 --> 11:12.171
It's just that a camera is right there.

11:12.254 --> 11:14.590
I'm trying to act like it's not there,
but I can't.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.176
I know how you feel.

11:17.885 --> 11:18.844
Honestly,

11:19.553 --> 11:22.848
I couldn't succeed beyond Bap-soon
because of my fear of cameras.

11:24.100 --> 11:25.768
How can you act like it's not there?

11:25.851 --> 11:28.187
-It feels like you're being watched.
-Right?

11:28.270 --> 11:30.439
Your eyes keep going to the camera.

11:31.816 --> 11:33.150
But it's just us here.

11:33.526 --> 11:35.319
-Let's try and get comfortable.
-Okay.

11:36.362 --> 11:37.697
Let's loosen those shoulders.

11:39.323 --> 11:41.951
-That feels good.
-Your muscles are very stiff.

11:42.410 --> 11:43.452
What is she doing?

11:45.454 --> 11:46.330
Song Ma-rin!

11:47.873 --> 11:49.291
Honey!

11:49.375 --> 11:50.418
-Hello!
-Hi!

11:50.501 --> 11:51.335
Hello.

11:51.419 --> 11:52.336
You're here!

11:53.254 --> 11:54.672
Just take pictures.

11:54.755 --> 11:56.924
Why did you massage that guy's shoulders?

11:57.007 --> 11:58.759
He's not a guy. He's an old man.

11:58.843 --> 12:00.177
Grandfathers are still guys.

12:00.678 --> 12:02.972
He looks rough and tough like an animal.

12:03.556 --> 12:05.182
The world is a scary place.

12:05.433 --> 12:07.977
Your kindness could be mistaken
for seduction.

12:09.103 --> 12:11.105
It depends on the person.

12:11.689 --> 12:14.191
Everyone here is a volunteer.

12:14.650 --> 12:15.735
Are you insulting them?

12:15.818 --> 12:17.069
Don't I donate too?

12:17.403 --> 12:19.405
I give the most money here.

12:19.655 --> 12:20.573
Don't show off.

12:24.744 --> 12:30.207
Didn't it cause you pain and grief
to come anywhere near Happiness?

12:30.833 --> 12:32.084
You come easily now.

12:33.627 --> 12:34.962
I'm still traumatized.

12:35.087 --> 12:36.630
I'm still in pain.

12:36.797 --> 12:38.048
It hurts here.

12:39.508 --> 12:42.136
I think you've overcome your trauma
thanks to your wife.

12:43.429 --> 12:47.641
Is it okay to make fun of my painful past
just because you're pretty?

12:47.850 --> 12:48.684
Sorry.

12:49.143 --> 12:53.397
I think I need to get more friendly
with the volunteers.

12:53.689 --> 12:55.941
-With those rough-looking men?
-Yes.

12:56.400 --> 12:58.152
I need to open up my heart.

12:58.861 --> 13:01.572
I need to bond and interact with them.

13:03.157 --> 13:05.701
-Are you feeling more relaxed?
-Why would you open up?

13:05.785 --> 13:08.454
-Photographer Song.
-Can you open up that easy?

13:09.455 --> 13:10.539
Take a picture of us.

13:10.623 --> 13:12.917
-Stand in the middle.
-Relax.

13:13.167 --> 13:14.043
Take it!

13:14.752 --> 13:15.836
I'm taking it.

13:16.170 --> 13:18.547
-One, two, three.
-Victory!

13:19.632 --> 13:20.883
-One more!
-One more.

13:22.176 --> 13:23.177
Oh, seriously.

13:24.470 --> 13:25.346
Enjoy!

13:25.471 --> 13:27.223
-Thank you!
-Enjoy!

13:27.306 --> 13:28.557
Would you like more meat?

13:31.477 --> 13:33.145
-Is everything okay?
-It's good!

13:33.229 --> 13:34.980
-Hello.
-Hello.

13:35.064 --> 13:35.940
Enjoy!

13:36.106 --> 13:37.942
Her husband's handsome.
What does he do?

13:38.025 --> 13:39.443
He has a real estate agency.

13:39.527 --> 13:40.402
Photographer Song,

13:40.486 --> 13:42.488
come eat with your husband.

13:42.571 --> 13:43.989
I will eat later.

13:45.366 --> 13:46.617
Oh, there's no water.

13:46.700 --> 13:48.702
-I'll get some more!
-Thank you.

13:48.828 --> 13:50.663
-Would you like more rice?
-Thank you.

13:50.746 --> 13:52.414
Why are you doing this?

13:52.498 --> 13:53.833
Are you Bap-soon?

13:56.418 --> 13:59.046
Bap-soon! Bring us two bowls of rice.

13:59.338 --> 14:00.923
Okay! Two bowls?

14:01.549 --> 14:03.133
Get it yourself, punk!

14:03.217 --> 14:04.844
Two bowls of rice.

14:07.137 --> 14:08.472
What's the matter?

14:09.598 --> 14:10.516
Don't do that.

14:11.016 --> 14:11.851
Don't do what?

14:12.226 --> 14:14.645
Don't smile at anyone
and talk in that cute voice.

14:17.314 --> 14:18.190
What?

14:18.858 --> 14:19.692
Yu So-joon.

14:20.818 --> 14:23.153
Are you being clingy right now,
or jealous?

14:23.863 --> 14:24.697
Both.

14:27.324 --> 14:28.158
What?

14:28.242 --> 14:29.660
I really like clingy.

14:30.911 --> 14:33.747
I'm trying not to make it obvious,
but I'm red with pleasure.

14:34.248 --> 14:35.082
What?

14:37.418 --> 14:38.544
Continue being clingy.

14:38.669 --> 14:40.838
Come on! Keep doing it.

14:41.672 --> 14:43.424
Why do you keep saying "Come on?"

14:43.507 --> 14:45.175
Stop playing around.

14:45.759 --> 14:50.723
I hate cool and mature relationships.

14:51.390 --> 14:54.643
I like you being clingy and immature,
things like that.

14:54.810 --> 14:56.186
I have the heart of a baby.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.773
I want to go. You're really weird.

14:59.857 --> 15:03.986
No. I want you to be clingy. Clingy.

15:04.695 --> 15:06.947
Hey, what if someone sees us?

15:07.031 --> 15:08.532
It's give-and-take.

15:08.616 --> 15:10.659
I'll cling to you
like a piece of gum.

15:10.743 --> 15:13.412
-Cling.
-This is annoying.

15:13.495 --> 15:15.414
You're an annoying piece of gum.

15:15.497 --> 15:18.584
-I like it.
-Oh, come on. Stop it.

15:18.667 --> 15:20.294
Oh. Mister, hello.

15:21.295 --> 15:22.296
Hello.

15:23.130 --> 15:25.799
You two look happy.
It should be a happy time.

15:27.009 --> 15:29.887
If you haven't eaten yet, you should eat.

15:29.970 --> 15:30.930
I have no appetite.

15:32.014 --> 15:34.183
Are you feeling ill?

15:34.600 --> 15:35.434
No.

15:39.021 --> 15:40.522
I heard you knew!

15:41.023 --> 15:42.858
About Se-young going to Japan.

15:43.984 --> 15:45.611
Ah... yes.

15:45.694 --> 15:46.904
You should've stopped her.

15:48.238 --> 15:49.114
How could you?

15:49.949 --> 15:50.783
I'm sorry.

15:57.414 --> 15:58.624
Se-young's going to Japan?

15:59.041 --> 15:59.875
Yeah.

16:13.639 --> 16:14.640
Yeah, Se-young.

16:14.932 --> 16:15.808
<i>Where are you?</i>

16:16.433 --> 16:17.393
<i>Let's meet.</i>

16:19.353 --> 16:21.480
Well... the thing is

16:21.605 --> 16:23.440
I just got home from work,

16:24.358 --> 16:25.818
so I don't want to go out now.

16:26.819 --> 16:27.778
Oh, really?

16:28.529 --> 16:29.655
You left work early.

16:31.073 --> 16:33.075
<i>I'll see you next time.</i>

16:33.867 --> 16:35.244
<i>You should go home and rest.</i>

16:38.163 --> 16:39.039
Ki-doong.

16:39.915 --> 16:40.749
<i>Yeah?</i>

16:45.963 --> 16:46.922
Sleep well.

16:50.050 --> 16:50.884
Yeah.

17:09.486 --> 17:10.821
You are so good at eating up.

17:11.196 --> 17:13.490
Oh, good job!

17:14.324 --> 17:15.367
Oh, really!

17:18.579 --> 17:20.289
The board director must be upset.

17:21.457 --> 17:23.584
It seemed like he depended
on Se-young a lot.

17:23.709 --> 17:26.170
He needs to let her go too.

17:26.837 --> 17:29.465
Ah! Should we take a trip this weekend?

17:30.424 --> 17:31.258
Where?

17:31.467 --> 17:32.301
Where?

17:32.468 --> 17:34.344
You just want to play.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.555
I should ask the guys.

17:37.681 --> 17:38.599
All together?

17:38.932 --> 17:39.767
Yeah.

17:40.225 --> 17:41.935
Is there somewhere you want to go?

17:42.436 --> 17:44.313
Do you like the mountains or the ocean?

17:45.105 --> 17:47.316
I just realised
I haven't asked you that.

17:49.151 --> 17:51.028
It's not even going to be the two of us.

17:51.153 --> 17:53.322
-Just go somewhere nearby to grill meat.
-Huh?

17:55.365 --> 17:56.825
<i>-I'm not going.</i>
<i>-Me neither.</i>

17:58.077 --> 17:58.952
What's this?

18:00.496 --> 18:01.330
They can't go?

18:03.082 --> 18:04.291
Too bad.

18:05.417 --> 18:06.251
Realtor.

18:07.002 --> 18:08.921
Do you like the mountains or the ocean?

18:09.004 --> 18:11.131
-One, two, three! Ocean!
-Ocean!

18:12.049 --> 18:13.217
I knew it.

18:13.550 --> 18:14.927
We are meant to be.

18:15.010 --> 18:15.844
We get each other.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.516
Then should we go

18:20.974 --> 18:21.975
to a deserted island?

18:22.059 --> 18:23.435
Let's all go to the beach.

18:23.519 --> 18:26.105
I can tell them I already booked it
and get them to come.

18:28.982 --> 18:29.817
Yu So-joon.

18:30.776 --> 18:33.362
Didn't you hear me
bring up a deserted island?

18:34.488 --> 18:37.533
I brought up deserted island
because I want it to be just us.

18:38.450 --> 18:40.369
Are you dull or what?

18:41.495 --> 18:44.289
Were you born this dull,
or are you getting worse?

18:45.082 --> 18:47.292
-Well...
-If you were born this way...

18:48.877 --> 18:51.380
-I need to ponder this seriously.
-What?

18:51.463 --> 18:53.132
What if we have a dull child?

18:53.340 --> 18:57.386
How will that child survive
in this cruel world like that?

18:58.137 --> 18:59.012
You're right.

19:00.013 --> 19:01.056
I really...

19:01.515 --> 19:04.393
want to go on this trip,
just the two of us.

19:04.476 --> 19:06.687
But, Se-young is leaving for Japan soon.

19:07.020 --> 19:08.897
It'd be nice to spend time together.

19:09.690 --> 19:11.817
Let's save our time for later,

19:12.151 --> 19:14.194
and go another time.

19:16.029 --> 19:17.573
Save it until when?

19:18.782 --> 19:20.742
Save it for just a bit.

19:21.118 --> 19:22.286
Wait just a bit.

19:24.872 --> 19:26.874
Oh, the smell of the ocean!

19:27.082 --> 19:29.209
-You like it that much?
-Yes.

19:29.293 --> 19:31.628
It makes me feel so good.
I'm glad I came.

19:32.254 --> 19:33.881
Were you thinking of not coming?

19:34.840 --> 19:35.757
I thought

19:35.841 --> 19:39.094
I might be butting in
on  a get together for friends.

19:39.219 --> 19:41.430
You know what to say now!

19:42.973 --> 19:44.725
You can be our friend from now on.

19:45.017 --> 19:45.851
Oh my.

19:46.560 --> 19:49.605
Then I suppose you would be

19:50.189 --> 19:51.190
my boy-friend?

19:51.773 --> 19:53.775
Oh, then I suppose you would be

19:53.901 --> 19:55.777
my girl-friend?

19:55.861 --> 19:58.280
What are you doing? Let's go unpack.

19:58.655 --> 20:00.240
The guys will do the barbecue,

20:00.324 --> 20:03.952
so the girls can get friendly.
Think of it as a mission.

20:04.828 --> 20:05.704
Girl-friend.

20:05.787 --> 20:06.663
Hurry up.

20:15.130 --> 20:16.006
Can we...

20:18.091 --> 20:19.885
forget about all our bad feelings?

20:20.677 --> 20:22.221
How about we try to get along?

20:27.226 --> 20:29.603
I know you don't like me.

20:30.854 --> 20:32.689
But it's always awkward when I see you.

20:34.816 --> 20:36.360
If I ever did anything to you,

20:37.236 --> 20:38.278
I'm sorry.

20:40.864 --> 20:41.698
Well...

20:42.616 --> 20:44.201
You didn't do anything wrong.

20:45.744 --> 20:48.163
We won't even see each other much anyway.

20:48.997 --> 20:50.624
Don't worry about me, Big Sis.

20:52.542 --> 20:53.377
Big Sis?

20:53.460 --> 20:55.254
You're older than me.

20:57.547 --> 21:00.884
Strangely, I have a hard time
getting close to people older than me.

21:02.010 --> 21:04.596
It's not because I dislike you,
don't get the wrong idea.

21:11.061 --> 21:13.355
We're only one year apart in age.

21:14.398 --> 21:16.233
As if age is important.

21:16.775 --> 21:18.151
Is she trying to win over age?

21:22.656 --> 21:24.783
Manager Kang, hurry up and light the fire.

21:24.950 --> 21:25.951
Be quiet.

21:26.952 --> 21:28.662
I'll do it, so just go.

21:28.829 --> 21:30.914
Why? I told you
to get friendly with Ma-rin.

21:31.039 --> 21:33.083
I need to talk to Ki-doong. Just go.

21:33.292 --> 21:35.669
Really? Something I don't know about?

21:36.169 --> 21:37.921
Go. I'll call you once it's done.

21:38.588 --> 21:40.716
Okay. It works for me!

21:43.885 --> 21:45.137
What is it?

21:46.471 --> 21:49.141
I came because it's better
to be with you than Song Ma-rin.

21:51.351 --> 21:53.812
Why did she follow us all the way here?

21:54.479 --> 21:55.522
Flower!

21:56.231 --> 21:57.316
Flower!

21:57.691 --> 21:58.525
Flower?

22:00.610 --> 22:01.903
Is there a dog here?

22:02.696 --> 22:04.364
I'm scared of dogs.

22:04.448 --> 22:06.450
Oh, jeez. It's not a dog's name.

22:07.034 --> 22:07.868
Flower!

22:09.202 --> 22:10.954
What happened to that punk?

22:12.497 --> 22:13.540
Where did Ma-rin go?

22:14.916 --> 22:16.168
Let's eat this tangerine.

22:16.251 --> 22:17.419
I peeled it.

22:20.422 --> 22:21.423
Flower!

22:22.632 --> 22:23.925
Where are you?

22:25.802 --> 22:28.847
Ma-rin! Where did you go, Ma-rin?

22:29.848 --> 22:31.141
I thought she came this way.

22:36.063 --> 22:37.105
Where is she?

22:41.526 --> 22:42.402
Wow!

22:42.861 --> 22:44.154
Such a big mailbox!

22:56.500 --> 23:01.004
WE DELIVER THE LETTER ON THE DAY
YOU CHOOSE, UP TO 50 YEARS LATER.

23:02.881 --> 23:04.049
What should I write?

23:06.134 --> 23:07.886
I haven't written a letter in so long!

23:24.820 --> 23:26.029
Oh, so pretty!

23:32.744 --> 23:34.037
<i>Dear Future Song Ma-rin,</i>

23:35.414 --> 23:37.082
<i>It is October, 2016.</i>

23:37.874 --> 23:40.669
<i>We are on the trip to the sea</i>
<i>before Se-young is leaving.</i>

23:42.504 --> 23:43.713
<i>Why don't you answer?</i>

23:44.005 --> 23:45.173
<i>Perhaps your heart races,</i>

23:45.257 --> 23:47.968
<i>-...so your fingers got paralyzed?</i>
<i>-</i>No.

23:48.301 --> 23:50.220
I'm writing an answer now.

23:50.929 --> 23:51.763
<i>You just sent me</i>

23:52.347 --> 23:55.475
<i>a really pretty picture of you.</i>

23:57.477 --> 23:59.271
He saw it, so why isn't he responding?

24:01.606 --> 24:02.941
Maybe I shouldn't have.

24:03.525 --> 24:05.193
He will tease me again.

24:06.528 --> 24:07.529
This is so nice.

24:08.155 --> 24:09.197
I love the beach.

24:09.823 --> 24:12.951
Realtor, reply to me.

24:14.870 --> 24:17.789
<i>This is before you know</i>
<i>about my time travel</i>

24:18.623 --> 24:19.791
<i>and we are happy now.</i>

24:20.917 --> 24:23.503
<i>I wish I didn't have the ability</i>
<i>to travel to the future,</i>

24:24.212 --> 24:27.340
<i>but the ability to freeze time instead.</i>

24:29.301 --> 24:30.969
<i>By the time you receive this letter,</i>

24:32.220 --> 24:34.222
<i>I pray you will not hate me.</i>

24:50.614 --> 24:54.242
You decided to leave
because of So-joon, right?

24:58.038 --> 24:58.872
Yeah.

25:00.415 --> 25:01.666
I knew it.

25:06.463 --> 25:07.297
Suddenly...

25:09.257 --> 25:11.051
I feel very awkward around you.

25:12.302 --> 25:13.678
Why are things awkward?

25:14.304 --> 25:15.388
I'd like to know why.

25:18.475 --> 25:19.518
I don't know.

25:21.561 --> 25:22.437
It's just...

25:24.105 --> 25:27.025
I sometimes think
that I'm a fool and a pushover.

25:30.862 --> 25:33.114
I do everything that suits your mood.

25:33.448 --> 25:34.741
I let you win all the time.

25:34.866 --> 25:36.868
I'm good with this or that.

25:38.119 --> 25:41.164
Still, it's not good enough for you,
you just treat me poorly.

25:41.289 --> 25:43.458
You call me out whenever you want
and get angry.

25:44.167 --> 25:45.627
It's true. I'm a fool for you.

25:49.422 --> 25:50.257
I...

25:52.759 --> 25:54.928
started working at Happiness
because of So-joon.

25:59.099 --> 26:01.685
I got a job at the company that I wanted.

26:02.852 --> 26:04.854
But So-joon asked me for my help.

26:06.022 --> 26:08.441
I was won over by a beer.

26:10.193 --> 26:12.529
I'm not leaving because of a guy.

26:14.322 --> 26:16.324
It was a job I started because of a guy.

26:18.034 --> 26:19.661
Now, I'm quitting that.

26:22.372 --> 26:23.540
Why do you do this to me?

26:25.417 --> 26:28.587
Do you need to make me feel
like I'm running away?

26:30.338 --> 26:32.257
You think you protected my pride?

26:34.259 --> 26:36.386
What pride do I have left?

27:12.589 --> 27:13.798
Are you insane?

27:15.425 --> 27:18.553
So, you're going to take
my contract deposit,

27:19.304 --> 27:21.473
yet you're not keeping the promise
you made me?

27:22.182 --> 27:25.101
I'm asking for time to prepare.

27:25.435 --> 27:28.521
No matter how I leave Myreits,

27:29.439 --> 27:30.899
the investors will think

27:31.566 --> 27:34.944
I am a project manager
abandoned by Chairman Yoo.

27:35.028 --> 27:38.448
It's hard to start a big business
with that image.

27:39.157 --> 27:43.286
All the congressmen, prosecutors,
government officials, and so on.

27:44.120 --> 27:47.957
I need to show them
I have something definite.

27:48.166 --> 27:49.250
So they will follow me.

27:49.834 --> 27:55.965
So they will join me, thinking
I am their family, a brother, a friend!

27:56.049 --> 27:57.467
I believe that.

27:58.802 --> 28:02.180
-I really believe that, Teacher.
-What if Jangho falls into ruin?

28:03.723 --> 28:05.725
Then all your plans will come to nothing.

28:07.477 --> 28:08.937
Why would you say that?

28:09.062 --> 28:10.522
That will never, ever happen.

28:10.605 --> 28:12.732
Isn't that why you invested, as well?

28:13.191 --> 28:14.359
Oh, dear.

28:15.527 --> 28:16.903
You pitiful man.

28:24.536 --> 28:26.037
Do you believe in fate?

28:27.706 --> 28:30.750
Even though the opportunities are given,

28:31.626 --> 28:35.088
there are always those
who live the lives they're meant to.

28:39.050 --> 28:39.926
Well, then.

28:41.302 --> 28:42.762
I understand what you're saying.

28:45.140 --> 28:46.975
I'm out, so you do what you want.

28:47.225 --> 28:48.393
Teacher,

28:48.476 --> 28:50.311
what do you mean?

28:51.229 --> 28:54.399
-What about your contract deposit?
-I'll let that go.

28:57.277 --> 28:58.653
Is that a problem?

28:59.529 --> 29:00.363
That is...

29:01.573 --> 29:03.575
You're just saying that, right?

29:03.908 --> 29:07.328
You just earned a billion won for nothing.
Buy something good to eat.

29:08.705 --> 29:10.957
Gosh, I lost money.

29:11.833 --> 29:13.418
I should just drink and die.

29:13.626 --> 29:14.502
So...

29:16.004 --> 29:18.715
you're giving up on that money?

29:19.257 --> 29:22.093
Why are you being so dramatic?
No, Teacher.

29:22.886 --> 29:27.265
I will consider your opinions again.

29:27.348 --> 29:31.770
-We can come up with an agreement--
-How can I trust someone who conned me?

29:33.688 --> 29:35.482
Do you know how dangerous...

29:36.733 --> 29:39.068
this gamble is for me?

29:40.069 --> 29:41.196
You wouldn't know.

29:43.823 --> 29:44.866
Kim Yong-jin.

29:45.658 --> 29:49.704
You will live the life
that is set for you.

29:50.705 --> 29:53.208
I've become convinced that you will.

29:56.127 --> 30:00.840
Then I will reconsider leaving Myreits--

30:00.924 --> 30:03.468
I told you that I don't believe you!
I don't trust you.

30:08.598 --> 30:10.099
You don't get why I'm doing this.

30:10.850 --> 30:11.684
I...

30:12.936 --> 30:15.688
I have something
I need to keep from happening. But...

30:16.815 --> 30:21.236
Sweetening and convincing you
is not the only way.

30:22.737 --> 30:27.367
Well... I'm not really sure
what you're talking about.

30:28.910 --> 30:32.080
Even if you're a fraud,
you shouldn't harm a person.

30:33.164 --> 30:35.208
Please explain so that I understand.

30:35.291 --> 30:37.085
Things won't work out
the way you want.

30:37.919 --> 30:38.878
I will...

30:44.968 --> 30:46.177
You know what? Just leave.

30:46.594 --> 30:47.428
Teacher.

30:49.722 --> 30:50.557
Teacher.

30:51.140 --> 30:51.975
Leave.

30:52.475 --> 30:53.518
-Teacher.
-Get out!

30:54.227 --> 30:55.061
Teacher.

30:55.228 --> 30:57.814
-Go. Get up. What are you doing? Get up.
-I'm sorry.

30:59.399 --> 31:01.568
-Teacher.
-Stand up.

31:02.193 --> 31:03.027
I'm really sorry.

31:03.111 --> 31:06.281
Please calm down.

31:06.364 --> 31:07.365
Get out.

31:09.534 --> 31:10.994
I will call you, Teacher.

31:12.579 --> 31:13.538
I understand now.

31:13.913 --> 31:15.373
I'm very sorry.

31:19.544 --> 31:20.753
About Se-young...

31:21.880 --> 31:23.464
Try to get along with Se-young.

31:23.715 --> 31:25.133
She's like family to me.

31:27.385 --> 31:29.429
Are all friends from childhood
like family?

31:30.597 --> 31:33.683
When I was alone
after the Namyeong accident,

31:34.183 --> 31:36.895
her mom and dad took care of me
like I was family.

31:38.062 --> 31:39.147
Se-young's parents?

31:39.606 --> 31:40.440
Yeah.

31:41.232 --> 31:43.443
I lived there for a few months.

31:44.277 --> 31:45.653
I owe them a lot.

31:46.863 --> 31:47.780
In the same house?

31:51.826 --> 31:54.704
I suddenly feel a lot of affection
for Se-young.

31:55.038 --> 31:55.872
What?

31:56.623 --> 31:58.041
How could she stand it?

32:00.877 --> 32:04.213
Wasn't there ever something
between you two?

32:04.714 --> 32:07.342
Something? Yeah right.
Stop saying nonsense.

32:08.885 --> 32:09.844
Yu So-joon.

32:11.054 --> 32:15.350
Since we're here at the beach,
let's be open and talk about our past.

32:16.100 --> 32:16.935
What?

32:17.060 --> 32:20.313
-How many relationships have you had?
-Why would you ask such a thing?

32:20.396 --> 32:22.231
It's all right.

32:22.982 --> 32:25.526
You can leave out the critical ones
and tell me.

32:25.652 --> 32:26.778
There's nothing to tell.

32:26.861 --> 32:29.489
Just tell me. I'll accept it.

32:29.656 --> 32:31.324
There's nothing to tell.

32:31.741 --> 32:34.744
I've never had a real relationship.

32:35.203 --> 32:36.037
What?

32:37.163 --> 32:38.456
It's true.

32:38.915 --> 32:41.084
I'm very hard to get.

32:41.334 --> 32:43.127
I'm like a natural monument.

32:44.671 --> 32:45.505
Not even once?

32:46.464 --> 32:47.298
No.

32:47.799 --> 32:48.633
Why not?

32:50.385 --> 32:51.970
It's hard for me to be honest.

32:52.720 --> 32:56.849
Also, there are so many fun things
besides dating.

32:59.227 --> 33:01.187
So, you have no experience with dating.

33:01.437 --> 33:03.356
That's why you're so dull.

33:05.066 --> 33:06.526
I get it now. I do.

33:06.609 --> 33:08.653
It wasn't that I couldn't. I just didn't.

33:11.656 --> 33:12.657
You don't regret it?

33:15.952 --> 33:18.329
You got married right away
without dating around.

33:19.622 --> 33:21.499
You are the woman that I married.

33:21.958 --> 33:24.043
You're supposed to be touched by this.

33:24.335 --> 33:26.754
"How did I end up
marrying a man like this?

33:26.879 --> 33:29.507
I must have saved the world
in my previous life."

33:29.882 --> 33:31.217
Isn't that a normal reaction?

33:31.801 --> 33:34.679
I just wish you had more experience.
You're in your prime.

33:35.805 --> 33:37.473
I can date you.

33:38.182 --> 33:40.435
I have nothing to do
but date you forever.

33:40.518 --> 33:43.312
What date? We're married already!

33:43.396 --> 33:46.149
What? Married people can't date
each other?

33:47.483 --> 33:49.861
You're a married man
and I'm a married woman.

33:49.986 --> 33:51.821
How can we date?

33:52.739 --> 33:55.241
Whatever. I know you like it.

33:55.324 --> 33:56.409
Whatever.

33:59.954 --> 34:01.414
Why don't we date?

34:01.998 --> 34:03.166
We're married already.

34:03.833 --> 34:07.253
Seriously, I can't even say no
since it's my husband asking.

34:08.838 --> 34:10.840
Let's do that. Let's date.

34:11.591 --> 34:12.842
Let's date passionately.

34:13.301 --> 34:15.428
Then today is our first day.

34:15.595 --> 34:16.763
-First day?
-Yeah!

34:19.348 --> 34:20.892
Wow! I'm dating.

34:20.975 --> 34:22.351
Where are you going?

34:22.435 --> 34:23.895
Catch me.

34:54.175 --> 34:55.218
What's going on?

35:00.181 --> 35:01.390
What?

35:05.937 --> 35:07.730
-What are you doing here?
-I don't know!

35:07.814 --> 35:09.899
I don't know either! I really don't know!

35:09.982 --> 35:12.235
No, don't do that.

35:12.318 --> 35:15.488
This is my room, my bed,
and that is my bag over there.

35:15.780 --> 35:19.534
Also, don-- don't pull this blanket down.

35:19.617 --> 35:23.830
I-- I don't think
I'm wearing anything underneath.

35:25.289 --> 35:26.249
Don't do it!

35:26.833 --> 35:27.834
Gosh, what is this!

35:28.668 --> 35:30.670
What happened last night?

35:30.753 --> 35:31.963
I don't know either!

35:39.971 --> 35:44.433
I've never kissed anyone at this age.

35:45.768 --> 35:48.813
I saved myself for Yu So-joon.

35:50.064 --> 35:51.649
Saving myself became crap.

35:54.694 --> 35:57.697
Why did I bother? Damn it.

35:58.781 --> 35:59.907
I'm the stupid one.

36:00.783 --> 36:02.618
Why did I even wait?

36:03.911 --> 36:06.956
I've kissed before.

36:09.458 --> 36:11.127
Gosh, good for you.

36:12.545 --> 36:14.630
Must be nice, you punk.

36:15.047 --> 36:16.007
Good for you.

36:16.799 --> 36:17.800
I did it with you.

36:19.343 --> 36:20.344
First kiss.

36:20.887 --> 36:21.762
Are you drunk?

36:22.513 --> 36:24.140
I kissed you?

36:24.265 --> 36:27.226
You remember in college
when we went on a trip?

36:27.685 --> 36:29.020
We played that drinking game.

36:29.896 --> 36:30.730
It turned out

36:31.314 --> 36:35.401
number one and three had to kiss.

36:35.610 --> 36:37.612
I was one and you were three.

36:37.695 --> 36:38.529
How did we do it?

36:42.200 --> 36:43.117
Like this?

36:44.243 --> 36:46.287
You started it.

36:47.079 --> 36:50.041
How many times do you have to say that?
I know. I know!

36:50.750 --> 36:52.043
-Okay.
-Oh, my goodness.

36:52.376 --> 36:54.212
I won't tell you to take responsibility.

36:54.295 --> 36:57.632
I am still the man here.
So, I want to take responsibility.

37:00.551 --> 37:02.803
What do you want me to do from now on?

37:03.512 --> 37:05.723
Don't even think about doing anything.

37:06.599 --> 37:07.975
-Hey, still...
-Stop!

37:08.726 --> 37:09.727
Keep your distance.

37:13.814 --> 37:15.149
Erase it from your memory.

37:15.691 --> 37:17.777
Yesterday was a big mistake.

37:20.029 --> 37:21.072
Hey, Se-young.

37:25.993 --> 37:26.994
Look at the ocean!

37:27.078 --> 37:28.537
It's so nice!

37:28.621 --> 37:30.206
-Realtor. Honey.
-Yes?

37:30.289 --> 37:31.832
-Should we take a picture?
-Yeah.

37:31.916 --> 37:33.751
-I'm a photographer. Look.
-I know!

37:34.335 --> 37:35.378
One, two...

37:37.546 --> 37:38.839
One, two...

37:42.301 --> 37:45.221
Why do you have your bags?
Let's eat breakfast and hang out.

37:45.304 --> 37:46.555
Let's just go to Seoul now.

37:47.556 --> 37:48.516
Let's just go home.

37:50.935 --> 37:51.852
Did they fight?

38:00.820 --> 38:03.155
We don't want to go home, right?

38:19.672 --> 38:21.340
Maybe I shouldn't have come.

38:25.970 --> 38:27.179
<i>The name is Song Doo-il.</i>

38:28.764 --> 38:31.017
The money comes in every month.

38:31.434 --> 38:34.979
I wanted to know which bank branch
it was coming from.

38:36.480 --> 38:40.109
If the money was wired from our bank,
we can find that out right away.

38:42.903 --> 38:44.238
<i>It was one of our banks.</i>

38:44.905 --> 38:47.241
<i>It was sent every month</i>
<i>from the Galwol-dong branch.</i>

38:47.450 --> 38:48.826
<i>It's near Namyeong Station.</i>

38:49.827 --> 38:51.454
This is the day the money comes in.

38:52.413 --> 38:54.373
Did he see me and run away?

39:11.682 --> 39:14.101
KIM YONG-JIN

39:26.405 --> 39:27.823
Pick up the phone.

39:35.498 --> 39:37.458
Hello? Teacher.

39:37.541 --> 39:39.210
I told you I have nothing to say.

39:39.919 --> 39:43.506
I completed the contract,
depending on you.

39:43.589 --> 39:47.510
If you back out like this,
I can't get 9 billion won anywhere.

39:48.219 --> 39:51.180
I already have all the investor's money.

39:52.390 --> 39:56.894
I can't cover the penalty
for breaching the contract.

39:57.812 --> 39:59.397
<i>Let's meet up and talk.</i>

39:59.855 --> 40:04.652
You're just leaving me
to be financially ruined if you do this.

40:04.735 --> 40:05.945
Then be ruined.

40:06.028 --> 40:08.030
Hello? Teacher?

40:09.573 --> 40:10.825
Damn it.

40:13.369 --> 40:14.370
Damn it!

40:15.871 --> 40:19.291
It looks like
he will leave Myreits anyway.

40:21.627 --> 40:25.297
That punk! I gave him an opportunity
to leave on good terms.

40:25.881 --> 40:27.049
I don't care anymore.

40:28.384 --> 40:31.429
I just need to get him away from So-joon.

40:33.222 --> 40:35.349
What am I supposed to do?

40:36.100 --> 40:37.059
Damn it!

40:39.019 --> 40:40.938
What do I do?

40:52.908 --> 40:54.785
There's nothing to see.

40:54.869 --> 40:57.079
-He fought with his wife.
-What's up?

40:57.163 --> 41:00.249
It's just a fight with the wife.
Please keep moving.

41:00.332 --> 41:02.209
It's nothing. Just a fight with his wife.

41:03.210 --> 41:05.546
-Why? Why is this happening to me?
-What's going on?

41:06.464 --> 41:07.548
Why!

41:10.009 --> 41:11.385
Wh-- Jeez.

41:14.638 --> 41:15.639
When did you get here?

41:16.140 --> 41:18.225
Why aren't you at work?

41:18.309 --> 41:20.311
The chairman of your company
is right here.

41:20.394 --> 41:22.271
I took an official day off!

41:22.938 --> 41:24.899
Did you? Good job!

41:25.024 --> 41:25.900
Move.

41:28.360 --> 41:30.237
I found a weird folder on your computer.

41:30.321 --> 41:31.322
What are you saying?

41:32.656 --> 41:33.491
Hey.

41:34.074 --> 41:38.037
I thought you it was bull when you said
you didn't feel like working.

41:38.704 --> 41:40.623
Now I know just how you feel.

41:44.001 --> 41:44.919
You punk.

41:45.794 --> 41:48.297
-Is this footage of the other world?
-Yes.

41:51.217 --> 41:54.720
-Is there footage of Se-young visiting?
-Huh?

41:55.054 --> 41:55.888
What?

41:56.514 --> 41:57.348
Nothing.

41:57.515 --> 42:00.476
Think less about the other world

42:00.559 --> 42:02.561
and think about this world.

42:03.395 --> 42:06.524
-There are bad rumors about Director Kim.
-Hold on.

42:14.406 --> 42:15.282
Mister?

42:17.076 --> 42:20.329
Who is he and why is he in our house?

42:30.089 --> 42:32.883
OCTOBER 27, 2016, FUTURE

42:53.529 --> 42:54.405
Damn.

43:00.869 --> 43:01.870
A ladder.

43:02.913 --> 43:04.415
<i>October 27.</i>

43:04.498 --> 43:05.624
SEOUL STATION

43:05.749 --> 43:09.003
<i>Today, Mister will steal my journal.</i>

43:33.819 --> 43:34.737
Okay.

43:36.238 --> 43:38.782
<i>It is most important that he doesn't know</i>

43:39.366 --> 43:40.826
<i>Kim Yong-jin is the culprit.</i>

43:45.414 --> 43:47.249
Please drive faster.

43:47.916 --> 43:48.751
Okay.

43:49.668 --> 43:52.755
I'll pay you whatever you want.
Don't lose that car.

43:52.838 --> 43:53.714
Okay.

44:24.703 --> 44:26.705
So-joon, what do I do?

44:26.872 --> 44:28.248
So-joon!

44:30.793 --> 44:31.669
Someone help!

44:32.878 --> 44:33.712
Help!

44:35.422 --> 44:36.882
Isn't anyone here?

44:37.549 --> 44:38.425
What do I do?

44:40.469 --> 44:41.970
Hey, hey!

44:42.513 --> 44:43.681
Let me go.

44:44.306 --> 44:46.058
-Don't.
-Why?

44:46.558 --> 44:48.686
You can't go over there now.

44:48.936 --> 44:50.896
You're here from the past, aren't you?

44:51.438 --> 44:52.564
Let go of me!

44:53.440 --> 44:54.900
I called the ambulance.

44:54.983 --> 44:55.984
They'll be here soon.

44:56.068 --> 44:57.820
This is the future for you.

44:57.945 --> 45:01.990
If you go now, what will Ma-rin...
What will your wife think?

45:02.157 --> 45:02.991
You can't.

45:05.160 --> 45:06.787
What do I do?

45:08.497 --> 45:10.499
What have you done to Ma-rin?

45:13.001 --> 45:16.964
So-joon. Let's get out of here for now.

45:19.258 --> 45:21.176
Why isn't he coming? It's getting late.

45:49.371 --> 45:51.165
I should be waiting for him.

45:56.795 --> 45:58.380
Why aren't you saying anything?

45:59.298 --> 46:00.591
You just keep smiling.

46:05.095 --> 46:07.306
I think I did the right thing
in marrying you.

46:08.307 --> 46:09.850
Life is so much fun.

46:13.562 --> 46:15.272
Where is this place, anyway?

46:15.773 --> 46:17.316
Where are we going?

46:21.320 --> 46:22.237
What is it?

46:23.238 --> 46:24.364
Where are we going?

46:48.931 --> 46:49.932
So-joon.

47:00.484 --> 47:01.568
It was just a dream.

47:07.491 --> 47:09.034
Yeah. Why aren't you coming?

47:10.160 --> 47:13.080
<i>What should I do?</i>
<i>I don't think I can go home today.</i>

47:15.541 --> 47:16.416
Why?

47:18.252 --> 47:21.588
I... came far away for work.

47:22.214 --> 47:24.216
There's work here
I need to tend to tomorrow.

47:27.094 --> 47:27.928
Did you eat?

47:28.387 --> 47:29.304
<i>I did.</i>

47:30.722 --> 47:32.057
<i>Lock up before bed.</i>

47:32.224 --> 47:33.225
By the way...

47:34.685 --> 47:37.020
nothing bad happened or anything, right?

47:40.107 --> 47:42.860
What bad thing would happen?

47:43.527 --> 47:45.195
<i>I had a bad dream.</i>

47:46.822 --> 47:49.324
Forget it. Talking about it is bad luck.

47:49.825 --> 47:53.287
Still, it's better to be careful.

47:53.871 --> 47:57.749
<i>Be careful of cars, people,</i>
<i>and everything you possibly can, okay?.</i>

47:59.001 --> 48:00.586
Yes, okay.

48:02.296 --> 48:03.922
Ma-rin, goodnight.

48:15.225 --> 48:16.059
What?

48:17.144 --> 48:18.937
Who dies?

48:19.605 --> 48:22.065
The director of the board for Happiness,
Shin Sung-kyu.

48:24.526 --> 48:25.611
It's just an accident.

48:26.570 --> 48:30.699
Your wife just happens to discover
Shin Sung-kyu.

48:31.617 --> 48:33.243
So-joon, don't worry too much.

48:33.327 --> 48:35.412
-I'll try to figure out--
-Why are you here?

48:36.455 --> 48:37.331
I just...

48:39.917 --> 48:41.418
Are you suspicious of me?

48:43.045 --> 48:46.381
I came here to stop the accident.

48:46.798 --> 48:48.634
-To try and help.
-Why?

48:49.259 --> 48:50.135
Why would you?

48:51.053 --> 48:52.888
Why would you help the people around me?

48:53.472 --> 48:54.348
I...

48:56.558 --> 48:58.435
-I--
-Why are you doing this to me?

48:58.769 --> 49:01.271
So-joon, I didn't do it.

49:01.647 --> 49:04.149
No, don't say a word to me.

49:04.399 --> 49:05.567
I don't believe anything.

49:07.235 --> 49:08.195
An accident?

49:09.488 --> 49:11.281
You expect me to believe that?

49:12.616 --> 49:13.450
So... So-joon.

49:15.869 --> 49:17.412
Hey! So-joon.

49:17.496 --> 49:18.538
I don't believe you.

49:18.622 --> 49:19.915
Hey! So-joon.

49:19.998 --> 49:21.541
I can find out for myself.

49:26.964 --> 49:29.800
SHIN SUNG-KYU, BOARD DIRECTOR
AT HAPPINESS HAS DIED

49:33.387 --> 49:37.933
...CONCLUDED TO BE AN ACCIDENT

49:42.688 --> 49:44.356
It was really just an accident?

49:46.608 --> 49:49.695
When are you leaving again?

49:50.362 --> 49:51.738
On the 27th of this month.

49:53.156 --> 49:54.199
The 27th.

49:55.450 --> 49:57.202
Why does it have to be that day?

49:57.285 --> 49:59.162
I told you that I'm leaving quickly.

49:59.663 --> 50:00.497
Why?

50:02.165 --> 50:03.000
Se-young.

50:03.375 --> 50:07.379
I'll buy tickets for your mom and dad,
as well as a place for them to stay.

50:07.754 --> 50:11.091
-Take them with you that day.
-Do you think I'm going there on vacation?

50:11.758 --> 50:15.554
I have to organize the new place
and get ready for my new job.

50:15.637 --> 50:18.432
-I'll be busy.
-Just take them with you.

50:19.516 --> 50:20.350
I mean...

50:21.935 --> 50:24.104
They must be so worried.

50:24.688 --> 50:27.315
They can see where you'll be living.

50:27.399 --> 50:29.317
Once they see how you'll be living,

50:29.860 --> 50:32.571
they'll feel a lot better.

50:32.654 --> 50:35.741
It's not like I'm going off to die.

50:36.033 --> 50:37.492
Why is everyone making a fuss?

50:39.411 --> 50:42.330
I'm booking the tickets.
Make sure they come with you.

50:42.914 --> 50:43.790
Okay?

50:55.343 --> 50:56.386
President Choi.

50:58.263 --> 50:59.765
-Hello.
-Hello!

50:59.848 --> 51:01.433
-How's business?
-Well, you know.

51:01.516 --> 51:03.101
I heard many great things.

51:03.185 --> 51:04.561
It's all thanks to you.

51:04.644 --> 51:07.481
Things have been great
since I moved into this building.

51:07.564 --> 51:08.398
Is that right?

51:08.482 --> 51:10.192
There's a good restaurant here, okay?

51:10.275 --> 51:11.151
-Yes.
-It's on me.

51:11.234 --> 51:13.278
-I'll treat.
-Oh, no.

51:13.445 --> 51:16.198
Hold on. Wait here. Sorry.

51:17.324 --> 51:18.158
Yes, sir.

51:20.827 --> 51:22.954
I like good food, too.

51:23.038 --> 51:24.664
Would it kill you to let me in?

51:25.791 --> 51:26.875
What should I eat?

51:30.754 --> 51:34.508
Well, about the city of Jangho...

51:36.551 --> 51:39.012
You will really regret it
if you miss out on it.

51:39.471 --> 51:42.682
I thought about you first.
That's why I came running over.

51:42.766 --> 51:44.267
Come on now.

51:45.227 --> 51:47.521
I called you to ask for a favor.

51:47.604 --> 51:50.440
How can you ask for a favor first?

51:50.524 --> 51:52.067
It makes it harder for me to ask.

51:54.111 --> 51:55.153
Please go ahead.

51:58.573 --> 52:00.367
There's something I really want to buy.

52:01.493 --> 52:02.577
It's this building.

52:03.328 --> 52:04.496
Can't you sell it to me?

52:04.579 --> 52:08.166
You know the company rents
this building out.

52:08.542 --> 52:10.794
Renting this wouldn't make lots of money.

52:11.419 --> 52:13.130
I'll give you a lot of commission.

52:13.797 --> 52:18.093
Talk to Chairman Yu about this for me.

52:26.685 --> 52:30.230
We've known each other
for about 15 years now, right?

52:30.564 --> 52:34.025
Yes, we made that deal in 2002.

52:35.402 --> 52:36.361
Right.

52:38.155 --> 52:40.240
I'm only saying this between us.

52:40.323 --> 52:42.117
I really shouldn't.

52:42.200 --> 52:43.118
What is it?

52:44.161 --> 52:47.122
We do have plans
to get rid of our smaller buildings.

52:47.998 --> 52:49.541
You must not spread a rumor.

52:50.000 --> 52:50.834
Really?

52:55.463 --> 52:57.799
-Hey! What brings you here?
-Oh?

52:57.883 --> 52:59.426
Hey. Choi Ik-chul.

52:59.843 --> 53:01.678
I have a meeting here.

53:01.761 --> 53:03.180
You didn't come to see me?

53:04.431 --> 53:06.099
This is an old classmate of mine.

53:06.183 --> 53:08.185
He's the board director of Happiness.

53:08.268 --> 53:11.938
This is a director at Myreits,
a large real estate investment company.

53:13.315 --> 53:15.817
-Hello. I'm Kim Yong-jin.
-Hello.

53:15.984 --> 53:17.444
You work for a great company.

53:19.529 --> 53:20.405
See you around.

53:21.239 --> 53:22.449
-Stay in touch.
-Okay.

53:27.370 --> 53:28.622
What do you mean?

53:30.040 --> 53:31.208
You want me to quit?

53:31.291 --> 53:34.336
You can't take pictures
at Happiness forever.

53:35.670 --> 53:40.675
I'll look into something better for you.
You could also continue studying too.

53:42.761 --> 53:45.472
Is this about me giving that shoulder rub
to Chief Kang?

53:46.723 --> 53:49.226
I told you to be clingy,
but isn't this too much?

53:50.310 --> 53:53.688
Honestly, you wouldn't have to work there
if not for me.

53:54.814 --> 53:59.027
You don't have to put in the effort
because of my ties to Happiness.

54:01.279 --> 54:02.822
You really want me to quit?

54:05.242 --> 54:07.661
Yes, I'd like it if you did.

54:11.873 --> 54:12.832
Why?

54:13.708 --> 54:16.670
It makes me happy to take pictures there.

54:17.170 --> 54:18.421
I'm learning a lot, too.

54:20.006 --> 54:22.509
I don't really want a better job.

54:26.304 --> 54:30.767
It makes me uncomfortable
and bothers me to have you there.

54:34.062 --> 54:35.272
Because of your parents?

54:38.817 --> 54:39.693
Yes.

54:42.153 --> 54:43.530
Still, it is my job.

54:48.785 --> 54:49.661
Maybe I'm wrong.

54:50.495 --> 54:52.414
Did I take it too lightly?

54:54.124 --> 54:56.710
So he came
even though he was so uncomfortable?

54:56.793 --> 54:58.795
Was he just trying to make me feel better?

55:01.715 --> 55:02.549
Was that it?

55:18.857 --> 55:19.899
Listen...

55:21.568 --> 55:22.777
I'm sorry,

55:24.029 --> 55:26.948
but I really want to finish
the project I've started.

55:28.825 --> 55:31.536
I got in on my own with my portfolio.

55:31.870 --> 55:34.122
Apart from all of that...

55:35.582 --> 55:38.001
I felt a sense of pride
for the first time in my life.

55:40.754 --> 55:43.465
I'll look into another place
where you can feel that way.

55:44.883 --> 55:46.593
It's not easy with my level of skill.

55:48.094 --> 55:49.846
I haven't had anything until now.

55:55.393 --> 55:58.772
I wanted you to be able to move on
from your past.

55:59.522 --> 56:01.649
So I spoke about Happiness casually.

56:02.567 --> 56:04.152
And I called you to come.

56:06.613 --> 56:09.449
I never thought
you would find it this bothersome.

56:10.784 --> 56:14.037
Gosh, I was so thick-headed
and thoughtless, right?

56:15.997 --> 56:17.540
No. It's not like that.

56:19.292 --> 56:22.295
I'll be more careful from now on.

56:23.588 --> 56:25.590
Let me just finish this project.

56:26.049 --> 56:27.926
I have my responsibilities too.

56:30.261 --> 56:31.096
Ma-rin.

56:32.680 --> 56:34.682
Let's think about it a little more, okay?

56:45.777 --> 56:47.362
<i>Is anyone there?</i>

56:49.531 --> 56:50.990
So-joon!

56:51.866 --> 56:53.868
So-joon, what do I do?

56:53.952 --> 56:55.036
So-joon!

56:59.416 --> 57:01.000
<i>Is anyone out there?</i>

57:21.855 --> 57:23.982
Ma-rin, are you sleeping?

57:25.275 --> 57:27.277
Yeah, I am about to.

57:34.451 --> 57:37.120
I have a question for you.

57:39.956 --> 57:43.501
If you could know the future...

57:45.044 --> 57:47.005
would you want to know?

57:48.590 --> 57:49.424
Yes.

57:52.093 --> 57:55.889
Why else do people look at tarot cards
and horoscopes?

57:57.599 --> 57:59.225
It could be easier not to know.

58:01.311 --> 58:02.562
I would be curious.

58:03.104 --> 58:04.439
And anxious to know, too.

58:07.775 --> 58:08.902
Why are you asking?

58:10.445 --> 58:12.155
Nevermind. It's nothing.

58:21.831 --> 58:22.916
Come to bed.

58:39.307 --> 58:40.642
Where are we going?

58:41.809 --> 58:42.852
The movie theater?

58:43.937 --> 58:47.023
-Going out to eat?
-You'll see when we get there.

58:47.982 --> 58:51.152
Where are we going? Tell me.

58:51.236 --> 58:52.654
I'm so curious.

58:57.992 --> 58:59.035
Song Ma-rin.

58:59.827 --> 59:00.912
It's been so long.

59:01.621 --> 59:03.748
-Hello.
-Hello, Chairman Yu.

59:03.831 --> 59:05.500
You've become so pretty.

59:06.000 --> 59:08.461
I know it's late,
but congratulations on your marriage.

59:08.920 --> 59:10.713
Who knew you would marry Chairman Yu?

59:10.797 --> 59:12.423
Thank you.

59:13.299 --> 59:14.217
Thank you.

59:14.884 --> 59:16.844
You wanted to learn from her.

59:16.928 --> 59:19.430
She's a client of ours,
so I showed her your portfolio.

59:20.265 --> 59:22.308
My goodness. You are lucky.

59:22.392 --> 59:24.936
-Who has a husband like this?
-Not at all.

59:25.019 --> 59:27.480
You have a great supporter!

59:28.189 --> 59:30.191
What have you been working on?

59:30.275 --> 59:31.859
Your photos have improved so much.

59:32.110 --> 59:34.279
Please take good care of her.

59:34.362 --> 59:36.197
There's no need to ask, Chairman Yu.

59:36.281 --> 59:37.615
-Don't you worry.
-Of course.

59:38.491 --> 59:39.492
Mr. Yu So-joon.

59:40.785 --> 59:42.954
She hates people
who get in through connections.

59:44.289 --> 59:45.540
I think you made a mistake.

59:51.462 --> 59:52.463
Ma-rin.

59:54.465 --> 59:55.425
Song Ma-rin.

59:57.552 --> 59:59.554
What are you doing here with me?

1:00:00.888 --> 1:00:03.016
How did you know
that I wanted to work here?

1:00:05.768 --> 1:00:06.894
Did she tell you that?

1:00:09.856 --> 1:00:12.108
Your connections are really amazing.

1:00:12.609 --> 1:00:14.444
One word from you and I'm in.

1:00:15.695 --> 1:00:17.739
My life is just great now, huh?

1:00:18.615 --> 1:00:22.160
Think about what is better for you,
rationally.

1:00:23.703 --> 1:00:25.538
How can you look down on me like this?

1:00:26.998 --> 1:00:28.666
Did I ask you to find me a job?

1:00:30.168 --> 1:00:32.378
You may not like me working at Happiness,

1:00:32.670 --> 1:00:34.047
but this isn't right.

1:00:34.297 --> 1:00:35.923
I'm doing this for you.

1:00:38.176 --> 1:00:39.344
This is for me?

1:00:41.095 --> 1:00:43.473
You don't even know how I feel.
How can it be for me?

1:00:45.933 --> 1:00:47.310
Do you know how I feel lately?

1:00:48.144 --> 1:00:49.604
Things are so good with you

1:00:49.937 --> 1:00:51.606
and work has been so good.

1:00:52.440 --> 1:00:54.901
I think,
what if it all breaks in one moment?

1:00:55.860 --> 1:00:57.987
I was so happy to the point
I was nervous.

1:00:59.405 --> 1:01:00.782
So don't break it,

1:01:01.783 --> 1:01:03.326
if you really care about me.

1:01:06.746 --> 1:01:08.373
That's what I want too.

1:01:09.624 --> 1:01:11.834
I want you to live happily
for even one more day.

1:01:12.710 --> 1:01:13.711
That's why...

1:01:16.172 --> 1:01:17.757
I want you to leave Happiness.

1:01:20.718 --> 1:01:21.803
What do you mean?

1:01:21.886 --> 1:01:23.471
Something bad will happen there.

1:01:24.055 --> 1:01:25.181
What does that mean?

1:01:29.018 --> 1:01:29.894
Let's go.

1:01:31.229 --> 1:01:32.730
I will show you what I mean.

1:01:33.147 --> 1:01:35.108
I'm so tired of hiding it.

1:01:35.775 --> 1:01:36.984
Where are we going?

1:01:38.444 --> 1:01:39.362
Let me go.

1:01:40.113 --> 1:01:41.239
Stand here for a moment.

1:01:41.322 --> 1:01:42.865
What are you doing?

1:01:44.784 --> 1:01:46.411
Do you see that billboard
behind me?

1:01:48.955 --> 1:01:49.872
Yes.

1:01:52.083 --> 1:01:56.170
It's about to show news that everyone
survived a bus accident.

1:01:57.296 --> 1:01:58.589
What are you saying?

1:02:00.967 --> 1:02:04.929
There will be breaking news that ther
was a shooting terror incident in the US.

1:02:12.895 --> 1:02:15.898
That bus will stop as soon as it leaves,

1:02:16.649 --> 1:02:19.360
when a man realizes
that he got on the wrong bus.

1:02:33.791 --> 1:02:36.878
That man will get on his knee
in front of his girlfriend.

1:02:37.920 --> 1:02:39.964
His girlfriend’s shoelace has come undone.

1:02:53.811 --> 1:02:55.021
How did you know?

1:02:55.521 --> 1:02:56.981
Because I saw it all already.

1:02:58.065 --> 1:03:01.736
I came here this afternoon.

1:03:03.863 --> 1:03:05.156
Why are you scaring me?

1:03:08.326 --> 1:03:10.244
-Ma-rin.
-Let's go home.

1:03:10.828 --> 1:03:12.371
This place is so hectic.

1:03:13.331 --> 1:03:14.749
Let's talk at home.

1:03:20.171 --> 1:03:23.883
I... can travel to the future.

1:03:27.303 --> 1:03:28.429
I said...

1:03:29.472 --> 1:03:31.098
I can travel to the future.

1:04:00.920 --> 1:04:03.130
<i>So I married a time traveler?</i>

1:04:03.589 --> 1:04:05.383
I can't go from just any location.

1:04:05.466 --> 1:04:07.677
What kind of lie is so detailed?

1:04:07.760 --> 1:04:10.972
<i>There's something we have to resolve.</i>
<i>A person lives and dies.</i>

1:04:11.055 --> 1:04:13.057
<i>It's not something we can control.</i>

1:04:13.140 --> 1:04:15.059
<i>Are you saying it could be murder?</i>

1:04:15.434 --> 1:04:17.770
What are you talking about?
We still have time.

1:04:18.312 --> 1:04:20.773
Oh, this is crazy!

1:04:20.857 --> 1:04:22.775
<i>What did you see in the other world?</i>

1:04:23.192 --> 1:04:25.194
The more you try
to stop this from happening,

1:04:25.778 --> 1:04:27.488
things could become worse.

1:04:29.949 --> 1:04:31.951
