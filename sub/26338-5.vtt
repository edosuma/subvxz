Come on, Jules, let'’s go.

02:51.519 --> 02:53.651

I was seriously considering

faking a bathroom emergency

Dude. Come on, gross.

Hey, Matty.

Just did another lap around

03:12.496 --> 03:14.324
or made any unusual calls
or had any visitors.

03:14.368 --> 03:16.544

I promise you,
it'’s not through telepathy.

03:22.593 --> 03:24.900
Now, we need to prove
he'’s committing treason

03:24.943 --> 03:26.293

03:26.336 --> 03:28.643
Which is why I hid
the large format X-ray imager

that you love this new toy, but
remember, it didn'’t come cheap.

03:37.391 --> 03:39.697
So use it to find
something on Kettner,

03:39.741 --> 03:43.223

You sure?Yeah.

08:59.713 --> 09:01.541
457? What'’s that
supposed to mean?

09:01.584 --> 09:03.455
When I was a, uh, kid,

09:03.499 --> 09:04.848
he bought me a Walkman

09:04.892 --> 09:07.547
and told me it was for
a surprise ski trip.

I thought it was a real
father-son vacation. Well, no.

09:11.420 --> 09:13.727
It was just an opportunity
to teach me survival skills.

09:15.424 --> 09:16.643
Like how to make
an avalanche beacon

09:16.686 --> 09:18.166
out of my new portable radio.

09:18.209 --> 09:19.384
JACK:
So you feel my pain

09:19.428 --> 09:21.386

sacrificing electronics.

09:24.781 --> 09:27.610
457 kilohertz.

09:27.654 --> 09:29.220
That'’s the frequency that
avalanche beacons use.

09:29.264 --> 09:30.265
So by tuning

09:30.308 --> 09:33.703
this AM radio down,

09:33.747 --> 09:35.226
I can hone in

09:35.270 --> 09:36.619
on any transmitting beacons,

09:36.663 --> 09:38.621
as long as they'’re
out there to be found.

09:43.583 --> 09:46.977
He'’s out there. I just
hope he'’s still alive.

09:50.894 --> 09:52.287
Don'’t even think
about it, Gomez.

09:52.330 --> 09:54.898
All I'’m thinking about

09:54.942 --> 09:56.204
is how heavy that metal
must feel in your hand.

09:57.814 --> 09:59.555
Go on.

09:59.599 --> 10:02.079
Fight it.

10:02.123 --> 10:04.212
But that blood loss
is gonna catch up.

10:04.255 --> 10:06.649
It'’s only a matter of time
before I take that gun

10:06.693 --> 10:08.651
and empty it into your head.

10:08.695 --> 10:10.435
Shut up. I could kill you

10:10.479 --> 10:11.872
with a clean conscience.

10:11.915 --> 10:14.483
But you haven'’t.It'’s what you know

10:14.526 --> 10:15.571
that'’s keeping you alive.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.791
Even if I...

10:21.621 --> 10:24.014
Adios, Gomez.

10:24.058 --> 10:26.669
Ooh! Ooh, that
felt really good.

10:26.713 --> 10:29.193
Really good-- my fist has been
wanting to meet your face

10:29.237 --> 10:32.762
ever since you put a hit out
on me and my friends, Gomez.

10:32.806 --> 10:35.025
I always knew that ski trip
would come in handy,

10:35.069 --> 10:37.027
I just didn'’t think it would be
in a desert climate.

10:37.071 --> 10:39.377
You still owe me a Walkman,
by the way.

10:39.421 --> 10:40.596
JACK:
Okay, Matty,

10:40.640 --> 10:42.467

10:42.511 --> 10:45.557

What'’s next?

10:45.601 --> 10:46.689
What'’s their condition?

10:46.733 --> 10:47.777
Eh.Gomez sustained

10:47.821 --> 10:49.997
minor injuries, and my father

10:50.040 --> 10:51.738
needs medical attention

10:51.781 --> 10:52.869
or he'’s not gonna
make it to exfil.

10:52.913 --> 10:54.218
JACK:
The hospitals and the clinics

10:54.262 --> 10:55.698
are gonna be a no-go.

10:55.742 --> 10:57.744
Gomez and his sicarios

10:57.787 --> 11:00.834
are gonna be
looking there for sure.

11:00.877 --> 11:01.791
Okay. I'’ve got something
that'’ll work,

11:01.835 --> 11:03.750
two blocks from you.

11:03.793 --> 11:05.055
Hope you'’ve been flossing.

11:14.717 --> 11:17.067
Sit down there.

11:17.111 --> 11:19.069
Don'’t move, or I'll
put one in you.

11:19.113 --> 11:20.767
GOMEZ: You should
really do yourself

11:20.810 --> 11:22.116
a favor, and eat a bullet,

11:22.159 --> 11:23.726
before my friends
find us.

11:23.770 --> 11:25.423
JACK: Yeah, you should
really do yourself a favor,

11:25.467 --> 11:26.947
and shut your mouth,

11:26.990 --> 11:28.252
before I start pulling
your teeth.

11:28.296 --> 11:30.472
What is...?Whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:30.515 --> 11:33.257
Please, don'’t shoot.

11:33.301 --> 11:35.346
I'’ll unlock the drugs.
You can have my money.

11:35.390 --> 11:36.957
What?

11:37.000 --> 11:38.262
No, no, no.
We'’re not thieves.

11:38.306 --> 11:40.351
And we are not here
to hurt you.

11:40.395 --> 11:42.745
My father is wounded,
and we need help.

11:42.789 --> 11:44.442
Is there anything
that you can do?

11:44.486 --> 11:46.706
I'’m not a surgeon.

11:48.533 --> 11:50.535
We have nowhere else to go.

11:51.798 --> 11:53.800
GOMEZ:
Maribel Vargas.

11:53.843 --> 11:56.716
Such a pretty name.

11:56.759 --> 11:59.022
There'’s a Vargas Pharmacy
a few blocks away.

11:59.066 --> 12:00.720
Your father'’s, perhaps?

12:00.763 --> 12:01.764
What'’d I tell you?

12:01.808 --> 12:03.461
Shut your mouth.

12:03.505 --> 12:05.028
Let'’s go now. The quicker
we do this, the better off

12:05.072 --> 12:06.290
for everyone,
am I right? Let'’s go.

12:06.334 --> 12:07.248
He'’s got a shard of glass
right there,

12:07.291 --> 12:09.032
and he'’s lost
a lot of blood.

12:10.338 --> 12:11.339
I'’ll do what I can.

12:11.382 --> 12:12.949
Thank you.

12:19.782 --> 12:20.740
KIDS:
Trick or treat.

12:21.958 --> 12:24.482
Great costume.

12:24.526 --> 12:26.615
Excellent makeup.

12:26.658 --> 12:27.877
Trick or treat, mortal.

12:27.921 --> 12:29.226
:
Okay.

12:32.273 --> 12:34.971
Little dude, you'’re
not even in costume.

12:35.015 --> 12:36.407
I'’m the Hulk.

12:36.451 --> 12:38.018
The Hulk is green and large.

12:38.061 --> 12:40.368
That'’s right.
When he'’s angry.

12:40.411 --> 12:42.805
You don'’t want to see me
when I'’m angry.

12:42.849 --> 12:45.416
Okay, all right, all right.
You got me.

12:45.460 --> 12:47.070
:
All right.

12:47.114 --> 12:48.419
Oh, got the pillowcase.

12:48.463 --> 12:51.422
All right. Don'’t take candy
from strangers.

12:51.466 --> 12:53.642
RILEY:
Bozer.

12:53.685 --> 12:55.513
You can'’t be giving out
handfuls of candy.

12:55.557 --> 12:56.906
We'’re supposed to blend in,

12:56.950 --> 12:58.299
not be the house
with a line around the block.

12:59.561 --> 13:01.171
Okay, sugar snap?

13:01.215 --> 13:03.173
Well, I just can'’t deny my
Halloween instincts, snookums.

13:06.133 --> 13:09.571
What?

13:09.614 --> 13:10.920
I don'’t know.

13:10.964 --> 13:12.748
Being fake married
to you is easy,

13:12.792 --> 13:17.318
but, you know, with Leanna,
it'’s just, it's different.

13:17.361 --> 13:19.015
What do you mean?

13:19.059 --> 13:21.713
I feel like I can'’t really
let my guard down.

13:21.757 --> 13:24.716
Well, that'’s normal.

13:24.760 --> 13:26.196
You guys are still getting
to know each other.

13:26.240 --> 13:27.850
Eh, it'’s more
than that.

13:27.894 --> 13:29.852
It'’s like I'm always wondering
if she'’s gonna see

13:29.896 --> 13:31.114
the real me and...

13:31.158 --> 13:32.463
decide to bail.

13:32.507 --> 13:35.075
Bozer, look,

13:35.118 --> 13:38.948
you guys are gonna get more
comfortable with time.

13:38.992 --> 13:40.384
And if you show her
the real you

13:40.428 --> 13:43.213
and she doesn'’t like it,
that'’s on her.

13:43.257 --> 13:46.303
Take it from your fake wife:
you'’re pretty awesome.

13:49.698 --> 13:51.091
Check this out.

13:52.919 --> 13:55.312
I'’ve never seen
this laptop before.

13:55.356 --> 13:57.053
It'’s not connected
to his Wi-Fi network,

13:57.097 --> 13:58.663
and there'’s no
reference to it

13:58.707 --> 13:59.969
on any of his other devices.

14:00.013 --> 14:01.666
A secret laptop he hides
in his floor?

14:01.710 --> 14:04.582
That'’s exactly the kind of place
you'’d keep stolen data.

14:04.626 --> 14:06.628
But it'’s air-gapped,
so the only way to get a look

14:06.671 --> 14:09.413
at what'’s on the hard drive
is to physically plug into it.

14:09.457 --> 14:10.458
He leaves the laptop
unguarded every time

14:10.501 --> 14:12.242
trick-or-treaters
ring his doorbell.

14:12.286 --> 14:14.070
Halloween is the perfect cover
for a little break-in.

14:14.114 --> 14:15.463
Yeah, but he only
spends, like,

14:15.506 --> 14:17.900
30 seconds
with each group of kids.

14:17.944 --> 14:19.902
I'’m gonna need more time.

14:19.946 --> 14:22.862
Okay, I got a plan.

14:22.905 --> 14:25.865
But I'’m gonna need some backup.

14:25.908 --> 14:27.823
You have a gentle
touch, Maribel.

14:27.867 --> 14:30.695
I may have to switch dentists.

14:30.739 --> 14:33.394
Ignore him. You'’re doing great.

14:33.437 --> 14:34.874
We'’ll be out of your hair
pretty soon, okay?

14:43.578 --> 14:45.145
OVERSIGHT: How long
have I been out?

14:46.189 --> 14:47.843
About an hour.

14:47.887 --> 14:50.150
We still have two miles
to exfil, so I figured

14:50.193 --> 14:51.586
I'’d build something to keep

14:51.629 --> 14:53.893
our violent friend over here
in line along the way.

14:53.936 --> 14:55.503
OVERSIGHT:
Hmm. Smart.

14:55.546 --> 14:56.808
You know, if you
shorten the wires

14:56.852 --> 14:59.202
from the battery to the
contacts, it reduces

14:59.246 --> 15:01.248
the resistance.Yes, I know,

15:01.291 --> 15:04.425
and that is true,
but I needed the extra slack

15:04.468 --> 15:06.340
to set the capacitors in series
to store the charge.

15:06.383 --> 15:07.384
Ah.

15:08.995 --> 15:10.431
Look, uh,

15:10.474 --> 15:13.477
I'’m sorry I got you
into this mess.

15:13.521 --> 15:17.264
You got intel that Gomez was
coming into town to celebrate

15:17.307 --> 15:18.700
and decided to take him
off the board.

15:18.743 --> 15:20.702
Given the threat
that he poses to you--

15:20.745 --> 15:24.314
and I-- it makes sense, and...

15:24.358 --> 15:25.489
and I appreciate it.

15:27.752 --> 15:30.886
JACK:
Okay, fellas, I think she'’s
about done with his cleaning.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.105
So the sooner we get
that contraption on him,

15:32.148 --> 15:33.671
the better.
I don'’t want him

15:33.715 --> 15:34.934
getting any wild ideas.

15:36.457 --> 15:38.285
Okay, let'’s do this quickly.

15:40.461 --> 15:41.331
All right, here we go.

15:43.377 --> 15:46.510
MacGYVER: Don'’t let that small
battery fool you, Gomez.

15:46.554 --> 15:48.512
It'’s not the volts that hurt,
it'’s the amps.

15:48.556 --> 15:51.167
Those electrodes will deliver
upwards of five milliamps

15:51.211 --> 15:53.213
into your chest every time
someone presses the button.

15:53.256 --> 15:55.215
OVERSIGHT:
It'’s like wearing a Taser.

15:56.694 --> 15:58.566
You get out of line,
and you get zapped.

16:02.570 --> 16:04.224
Would you like a demonstration?

16:10.143 --> 16:11.971
Go for it.
If you can reach it,

16:12.014 --> 16:14.669
you can do whatever
you like with it.

16:25.201 --> 16:26.594
Ooh!

16:26.637 --> 16:28.596
Ooh, ooh, please.

16:28.639 --> 16:30.206
Tell me it'’s my turn.

16:30.250 --> 16:32.643
What do you say, Gomez?
Should I let him use it,

16:32.687 --> 16:33.818
or do you get the picture

16:33.862 --> 16:35.342
MacGYVER:
Hey, Matty.

16:35.385 --> 16:37.822
Almost done packing up.

16:37.866 --> 16:39.433
Ready to head to exfil.
What'’s going on?

16:39.476 --> 16:41.261
MATTY:
Mac, I don'’t know how,

16:41.304 --> 16:44.046
but Gomez'’s sicariosare inbound
to your current location.

16:44.090 --> 16:45.482
I killed your comms in case

16:45.526 --> 16:46.962
they traced your signal,
but you got to get

16:47.006 --> 16:49.182
out of there right now.They'’re coming.

16:49.225 --> 16:50.226
How the hell did
they know where we were?

16:50.270 --> 16:51.445
I'’m sorry.

16:51.488 --> 16:53.403
I had to call them.

16:53.447 --> 16:54.709
Gomez won'’t just kill me,

16:54.752 --> 16:57.277
he'’ll, he'll murder
my entire family.

16:57.320 --> 16:58.713
You don'’t know
what it'’s like

16:58.756 --> 17:00.889
to live here.

17:00.932 --> 17:03.109
You'’re right, we don't.

17:03.152 --> 17:04.501
And I'’m sorry that
we involved you in this,

17:04.545 --> 17:06.938
but please, put down the gun.

17:06.982 --> 17:08.897
GOMEZ: You'’re doing
the right thing, Maribel.

17:08.940 --> 17:10.333
Just keep the gun on them,

17:10.377 --> 17:12.640
and I'’ll make
your family rich.

17:12.683 --> 17:14.076
JACK:
Come on. Y-You know

17:14.120 --> 17:16.122
better than to take this monster
at his word.

17:16.165 --> 17:17.079
Put that down now.

17:20.909 --> 17:22.041
Stop moving.

17:29.657 --> 17:31.180
They'’re surrounding
the building.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.416
Alto.

17:52.027 --> 17:53.985
♪

18:10.350 --> 18:11.786
Pase.

18:18.140 --> 18:19.707
We got to get as far away
as we can while we can.

18:19.750 --> 18:20.925
JACK:
Yeah, but it'’s not just

18:20.969 --> 18:22.579
the sicarios
we got to worry about.

18:22.623 --> 18:26.453
If sweet little Maribel here
would drop the dime on us--

18:26.496 --> 18:29.673
no offense-- then anybody
in this city could be onto us.

18:40.684 --> 18:42.991
Maribel took a bus out of town,

18:43.034 --> 18:45.167
called her family,
told them to do the same.

18:45.211 --> 18:47.213
Well, I'’m glad to hear the
dentist is nice and safe,

18:47.256 --> 18:48.953
but the three amigos are
still good and stuck here.

18:48.997 --> 18:49.911
OVERSIGHT:
Matty texted.

18:49.954 --> 18:50.825
The exfil'’s blown.

18:50.868 --> 18:52.957
La Ola sicarios

18:53.001 --> 18:55.264
are on the lookout for choppers
anywhere around the city.

18:55.308 --> 18:56.222
GOMEZ:
You should let me go now.

18:56.265 --> 18:58.093
At least give yourselves

18:58.137 --> 19:00.748
a head start before
my men hunt you down.

19:00.791 --> 19:02.271
JACK:
Come on, man, just,

19:02.315 --> 19:04.882
just one good zap
I'’ll slip you some cash.

19:04.926 --> 19:05.970
Well, Matty
should be able

19:06.014 --> 19:07.668
to find us another ride
out of town.

19:07.711 --> 19:09.104
She'’s gonna try.

19:09.148 --> 19:10.279
But we can'’t just
wait around here

19:10.323 --> 19:12.716
with our fingers
crossed, man.

19:12.760 --> 19:15.328
Come on. I saw a police station
a few blocks back.

19:15.371 --> 19:17.199
What do you say
I go in there and see

19:17.243 --> 19:18.505
if I can recruit us
a little help, yeah?

19:18.548 --> 19:20.115
I think it'’s a good idea.

19:20.159 --> 19:21.247
All right.But since it only does

19:21.290 --> 19:23.858
take one dirty cop
to alert the cartel,

19:23.901 --> 19:25.903
you and I keep Gomez on the
move, try to get out of town.

19:25.947 --> 19:27.209
You call when
you find help, yeah?

19:27.253 --> 19:29.080
Sounds good, I'’ll see you soon.All righty.

19:34.129 --> 19:36.740
Hey. Hey-hey, everybody,
listen up.

19:36.784 --> 19:38.394
I got an emergency
situation here.

19:38.438 --> 19:39.526
Who

19:39.569 --> 19:40.875
How can I help?

19:40.918 --> 19:44.183
Well, I, uh, got a bit...

19:44.226 --> 19:47.055
Were you robbed:
No, sir, not today. No.

19:47.098 --> 19:50.232
I'’m a U.S. federal agent, and
I have Luis Gomez in custody.

19:50.276 --> 19:51.668
Really?

19:51.712 --> 19:53.279
JACK: Really. Yeah.
The one and only.

19:53.322 --> 19:56.020
His killers are coming after
my friends, and we need a...

19:56.064 --> 19:58.240
exit strategy on the down low.

19:58.284 --> 20:00.547
I was kind of hoping we could
get a police escort out of León.

20:03.680 --> 20:04.768
Are you insane?

20:04.812 --> 20:06.248
We cannot help.

20:06.292 --> 20:08.119
JACK:
Why?

20:08.163 --> 20:11.949
Oh, I get it. Everybody in here
is afraid of the big bad Gomey.

20:11.993 --> 20:13.255
Got it.

20:13.299 --> 20:15.344
Maybe I'’m aiming
a little high here.

20:15.388 --> 20:17.259
Forget the escort.

20:17.303 --> 20:20.088
Can anybody in here get me
a plane or a helicopter?

20:22.743 --> 20:25.267
I'’m serious, man.
I-I'’m, I'm telling you,

20:25.311 --> 20:27.138
I got a frickin'’ supervillain

20:27.182 --> 20:29.228
in custody, and nobody in here
wants to be a cop today?

20:29.271 --> 20:30.272
Is that it?

20:30.316 --> 20:32.709
This is Mexico, cowboy.

20:41.109 --> 20:42.458
Hey.

20:42.502 --> 20:45.069
Do you really
have Luis Gomez?

20:45.113 --> 20:46.462
Yeah, that'’s right.

20:46.506 --> 20:47.724
What will you do with him?

20:47.768 --> 20:49.422
Well, I'’m gonna squeeze

20:49.465 --> 20:52.860
his tiny little brain,
get every bit of intel I can

20:52.903 --> 20:55.036
on La Ola cartel and then I'’m-a
throw him in a hole somewhere,

20:55.079 --> 20:56.342
let him rot like an apple.

20:57.995 --> 20:59.345
Look...

20:59.388 --> 21:01.912
I have grown up
in that man'’s shadow,

21:01.956 --> 21:04.741
watched his power spread across
my country like a disease.

21:04.785 --> 21:06.482
Now'’s your chance
to do something about it.

21:08.005 --> 21:10.965
I know where
we can find a plane.Okay, good.

21:11.008 --> 21:13.228
What about a pilot?You'’re looking
at him, sport.

21:13.272 --> 21:15.883
What'’s your name?Enrique Cardoza.

21:15.926 --> 21:17.276
Jack Dalton.

21:17.319 --> 21:19.930
Okay, Calvin,
you'’re clear on the plan?

21:19.974 --> 21:22.498
For the billionth time, yes.

21:22.542 --> 21:25.327
You know, you
caught my dad

21:25.371 --> 21:29.157
right when we got to the houses
giving out full-size candy bars.

21:29.200 --> 21:29.940
:
Beep... beep...

21:29.984 --> 21:31.333
What are you doing?

21:31.377 --> 21:33.161
Bee... That'’s the sound
of my friend Matty

21:33.204 --> 21:34.902
backing a dump truck
full of candy

21:34.945 --> 21:36.207
into your driveway

21:36.251 --> 21:38.558
as a thank-you
for your sacrifice.

21:38.601 --> 21:41.256
Dump truck?
You heard me.
You and your friends
will be sick

21:41.300 --> 21:42.779
for a year-- tummy aches!

21:42.823 --> 21:44.172
Promise?
Oh, I promise.

21:44.215 --> 21:45.347
Tummy ache!
Hey, hey!

21:45.391 --> 21:46.957
Yeah.

21:49.873 --> 21:52.006
Trick or treat.

21:52.049 --> 21:53.007
Ooh. Cool.

21:54.617 --> 21:56.706
My dog loves candy...

21:56.750 --> 21:57.881
Riley, go.

22:04.540 --> 22:06.194
CALVIN:
Did you know the guy
who invented Dracula,

22:06.237 --> 22:08.196
like, literally never
went to Transylvania?

22:08.239 --> 22:10.981
I did not. You'’re very
smart for your age.Mahalo.

22:11.025 --> 22:12.374
That'’s Hawaiian, you know.

22:12.418 --> 22:14.507
My mom and dad took me
to Hawaii last year.

22:14.550 --> 22:16.204
It was cool.

22:17.901 --> 22:20.730
Hawaii is so nice...

22:20.774 --> 22:21.992
[Calvin continues chatting
indistinctly]

22:29.478 --> 22:31.959
And you know you
can have both, right?

22:32.002 --> 22:33.961
Well, um...

22:34.004 --> 22:35.745
my dad said just one piece.

22:38.966 --> 22:40.097
RILEY :
Okay.

22:40.141 --> 22:42.099
I'’m seeing plenty of evidence

22:42.143 --> 22:43.144
Kettner'’s selling secrets

22:43.187 --> 22:44.537
to the Chinese, but...

22:44.580 --> 22:47.148
these files are massive.
Cloning the hard drive

22:47.191 --> 22:48.584
is gonna take longer
than I thought.

22:48.628 --> 22:50.064
Lollipop.

22:50.107 --> 22:51.195
Don'’t have any
of those yet.

22:51.239 --> 22:52.414
He'’s adorable,

22:52.458 --> 22:54.982
but I really have
to get back inside, so...

22:55.025 --> 22:58.028
Actually, my wife and I
practice something called

22:58.072 --> 22:59.290
"Free-Range Parenting."

22:59.334 --> 23:01.292
You know, we resist
the urge to interfere

23:01.336 --> 23:03.294
in Calvin'’s decision-
making process,

23:03.338 --> 23:05.601
so he develops his own
healthy judgment paradigm.

23:05.645 --> 23:07.777
CALVIN:
What'’s "high...

23:07.821 --> 23:09.388
fer

23:11.999 --> 23:13.740
I'’m sorry,

23:13.783 --> 23:15.829
I really need to go back inside.Bozer, I need more time.

23:15.872 --> 23:17.483
Hey, did, Mr. Kramer tell you
about the trash collectors?

23:17.526 --> 23:19.136
I mean, you think
you know some...

23:19.180 --> 23:21.922
I really have to go.
Good night.

23:21.965 --> 23:24.011
BOZER:
Uh, excuseme?

23:24.054 --> 23:27.014
You can'’t just throw
candy at my son.
He has a nut allergy!

23:27.057 --> 23:29.625
Get your hand off my door.

23:29.669 --> 23:32.889
Don'’t hit him with the candy.

23:32.933 --> 23:34.456
Go ahead and close
the door, then.

23:34.500 --> 23:36.284
You'’re closing it 'cause
I'’m telling you to close it.

23:36.850 --> 23:38.155
Okay, Riley, I hope you'’re out,

23:38.199 --> 23:39.156
because Kettner'’s
coming your way.

23:45.249 --> 23:46.686
KETTNER :
Don'’t ever call me

23:46.729 --> 23:48.557
on this phone again.
Let me get my landline.

24:04.399 --> 24:05.879
BOZER:
Riley

24:07.315 --> 24:09.448
Riley?

24:13.190 --> 24:15.366
You know, far
as Halloween goes,

24:15.410 --> 24:18.282
this isn'’t the worst one
we'’ve had together.

24:18.326 --> 24:20.763
:
Yeah.

24:20.807 --> 24:22.765
How much of it do you remember?

24:22.809 --> 24:25.464
Pieces.

24:27.117 --> 24:29.250
The Buzz Lightyear costume
she made me...

24:29.293 --> 24:31.774
Oh, yeah....hanging on the
back of my door.

24:31.818 --> 24:34.995
Sitting by my
bedroom window,

24:35.038 --> 24:37.519
watching all the other
kids trick-or-treat.

24:37.563 --> 24:38.955
God, it was years

24:38.999 --> 24:42.176
before Halloween meant
anything else to me, you know?

24:42.219 --> 24:45.135
Well, losing your mom is...

24:45.179 --> 24:48.617
not an easy thing for
a five-year-old to understand.

24:48.661 --> 24:50.358
You still think about her?

24:50.401 --> 24:51.185
Every day.

24:51.228 --> 24:52.578
You?

24:52.621 --> 24:54.057
Of course.

24:54.101 --> 24:56.495
At this point,
it'’s all fuzzy memories.

24:56.538 --> 24:58.671
She always smelled like vanilla.

24:58.714 --> 25:00.716
Poême.What?

25:00.760 --> 25:02.283
That was her favorite perfume.

25:02.326 --> 25:04.590
I got her a bottle
on our honeymoon in Paris,

25:04.633 --> 25:06.069
and then every anniversary

25:06.113 --> 25:07.854
after that.
She used to say

25:07.897 --> 25:11.118
she needed it to cover up
the smell of what she
called my cologne:

25:11.161 --> 25:12.380
WD-40.

25:15.383 --> 25:17.559
You know, Angus,

25:17.603 --> 25:19.430
when your mom died,
I felt as though

25:19.474 --> 25:21.824
the tether of my home life
had been cut.

25:21.868 --> 25:24.784
I took every overseas op
I could get,

25:24.827 --> 25:27.264
telling myself that the distance

25:27.308 --> 25:28.788
would keep you safe.

25:28.831 --> 25:30.703
But that was just...
that was just me...

25:30.746 --> 25:33.140
rationalizing.

25:33.183 --> 25:35.272
I was avoiding
my own grief.

25:35.316 --> 25:39.799
I realize I could never
make up for that, but...

25:39.842 --> 25:44.151
a fresh start with us
would mean everything to me.

25:46.501 --> 25:48.634
GOMEZ:
Aw. This is better

25:48.677 --> 25:50.723
than a telenovela.

25:50.766 --> 25:52.028
Her death was
the best thing

25:52.072 --> 25:54.465
that could have happened
to you two.

25:54.509 --> 25:55.379
OVERSIGHT:
You know what?

25:55.423 --> 25:56.685
Here we go.No, no, no, no.

25:56.729 --> 25:57.817
Let me.

25:57.860 --> 26:00.471
I lost my wife anddaughter

26:00.515 --> 26:02.561
when the Garcia
brothers put a bomb

26:02.604 --> 26:05.215
in my car.
One morning,

26:05.259 --> 26:08.741
Isabel is taking Flor to school,
like any other day.

26:08.784 --> 26:10.743
An instant later...

26:10.786 --> 26:13.528
they'’re gone.

26:13.572 --> 26:16.749
But I didn'’t wallow in my grief.

26:16.792 --> 26:20.317
I... I realized my family
had made me weak.

26:20.361 --> 26:23.407
I made the choice never
to be weak again.

26:23.451 --> 26:25.845
The cartel is
my family now.

26:25.888 --> 26:28.848
That'’s sad.
And by that,

26:28.891 --> 26:31.198
I mean pathetic.You really think
any of your guys

26:31.241 --> 26:33.069
would light a candle for you
when you die?

26:35.855 --> 26:38.205
Matty. Tell me Jack
is recruiting help.

26:38.248 --> 26:41.121
He did-- just not
the kind we expected.

26:41.164 --> 26:44.472
He gained access
to a small plane, so new plan.

26:44.515 --> 26:45.691
Fly Gomez out of Mexico.

26:45.734 --> 26:47.649
You need to meet him
at a landing strip

26:47.693 --> 26:49.042
just outside of León.

26:49.085 --> 26:50.913
I'’m gonna send you coordinates.

26:50.957 --> 26:52.959
This is five miles away.

26:55.657 --> 26:58.268
OVERSIGHT:
Damn it. The road'’s blocked.

26:58.312 --> 27:00.096
:
Oh...

27:00.140 --> 27:02.403
Did I forget to mention
the parade?

27:02.446 --> 27:04.274
Sorry. Slipped
my mind.

27:04.318 --> 27:06.625
Nobody'’s going anywhere
on Día de los Muertos.

27:12.761 --> 27:14.937
We are sitting ducks in traffic.

27:14.981 --> 27:16.373
Totally exposed on foot.

27:16.417 --> 27:18.332
These guys are everywhere.

27:18.375 --> 27:20.682
There'’s no way we're
gonna get through the city.

involve getting shot,
and it'’s a 50-foot drop.

29:02.088 --> 29:04.220
All right, we'’ll be falling
at a rate 58.7 feet per second

that'’s 38.5 miles per hour,

30:27.129 --> 30:29.088
You know, when you told me your
grandfather had an airplane,

30:29.131 --> 30:31.003
I kind of figured
you meant a whole one.

men from La Ola

31:12.522 --> 31:14.002
and others.

31:14.046 --> 31:16.396
It'’s been a year

31:16.439 --> 31:18.441
since I joined
the police,

31:18.485 --> 31:21.053
hoping to get
some justice, but...

31:21.096 --> 31:22.924
everyone'’s either
in the cartel'’s pocket

31:22.968 --> 31:24.970
or too afraid to make arrests.

31:25.013 --> 31:26.623
Hmm.

31:26.667 --> 31:28.495
You know,
el mundo esta patas arriba,

31:28.538 --> 31:31.063
when the police are the ones
who must hide their faces.

31:31.106 --> 31:33.761
But if we can put Gomez
in an American prison,

31:33.804 --> 31:35.589
beyond the reach of
his corrupt friends,

31:35.632 --> 31:38.461
it will send a powerful message
to the cartels.

31:40.724 --> 31:42.770
You know, I'’ve encountered

31:42.813 --> 31:46.078
seemingly unstoppable evil
on every continent.

31:46.121 --> 31:49.124
Evil that entire governments
are powerless against.

31:49.168 --> 31:51.213
Sometimes it just takes
one person stepping up

31:51.257 --> 31:53.389
to show a man like Gomez
he'’s not a god.

31:53.433 --> 31:54.913
He'’s flesh and blood,
just like me and you,

31:54.956 --> 31:56.740
and he can be taken down.

31:56.784 --> 31:59.569
You know, you'’re doing
the right thing here, Enrique.

31:59.613 --> 32:02.007
I really appreciate it,
and I take it back.

32:02.050 --> 32:05.271
I think this old girl'’s
gonna fly just fine.

32:07.012 --> 32:09.144
I'’ve flown a lot worse,
to be honest with you.

32:11.755 --> 32:14.715
If your friends can really get
Luis Gomez all the way here.

32:14.758 --> 32:17.022
Ah, they'’ll be here.

in writing, not a moment before.

32:30.861 --> 32:32.341
Stop playing games, Gomez.

32:32.385 --> 32:34.735
This is too important
to keep secret.

32:34.778 --> 32:36.824
You better make sure
I stay alive, then.

32:36.867 --> 32:40.175
Be a shame if I took this
information to my grave.

32:40.219 --> 32:43.570
Rafa'’s flooding
the streets with his men.

32:43.613 --> 32:45.006
It'’s only a matter of time
before he find us in here.

32:47.313 --> 32:48.967
What was that about?

32:50.881 --> 32:52.448
I have reliable intel

32:52.492 --> 32:57.018
that Jonah Walsh finished
his KX7 drug cocktail.

32:57.062 --> 33:00.848
Gomez knows how to find Walsh.

33:00.891 --> 33:03.807
Wow. That'’s the real reason
you went after him,

33:03.851 --> 33:05.200
why you initiated this op.

33:05.244 --> 33:06.897
Walsh could be
months, weeks

33:06.941 --> 33:08.464
from selling this
on the open market.

33:08.508 --> 33:11.990
Now, look, son,

33:12.033 --> 33:14.166
I know I should have
read you in.

33:14.209 --> 33:15.689
I-I don'’t know why... Look.

33:15.732 --> 33:18.474
Let'’s just focus on finding
Jack and his plane for now.

33:18.518 --> 33:20.346
GOMEZ:
There'’s a cemetery.

33:20.389 --> 33:24.263
El Cementerio De San Pedro.

33:24.306 --> 33:26.613
Years ago, when I
first joined La Ola,

33:26.656 --> 33:29.181
I helped build a tunnel to
move product out of León.

33:29.224 --> 33:31.922
Months later, the Federales
found it, and they shut it down.

33:31.966 --> 33:33.707
If we can get there,

33:33.750 --> 33:35.361
we can escape beneath
the sicarios'’feet.

33:35.404 --> 33:37.015
OVERSIGHT:
You'’re telling me that

33:37.058 --> 33:39.713
the whole time we were driving
and running and getting shot at,

33:39.756 --> 33:41.062
there were underground tunnels
we could use

33:41.106 --> 33:42.803
to get out of the city? Sí,but that

33:42.846 --> 33:45.371
was before I knew I had
a target on my back, too.

33:45.414 --> 33:48.287
He may be a
cold-blooded monster,

33:48.330 --> 33:50.071
but he'’s also a
conniving opportunist.

33:50.115 --> 33:51.768
He'’s gonna do anything
he can to stay alive,

33:51.812 --> 33:53.248
so I say we take our chances

33:53.292 --> 33:55.207
in the tunnels,
get the hell out of here,

33:55.250 --> 33:57.078
and then you can squeeze him
for whatever intel you want.

34:07.132 --> 34:08.089
I can'’t stay
in this closet forever.

34:08.133 --> 34:09.395
You got to get me out of here.

34:09.438 --> 34:10.613
What'’s the plan?

34:10.657 --> 34:11.919
Well, it'’s not
ringing the doorbell.

34:11.962 --> 34:13.268
He'’s not opening up anymore,
so...

34:13.312 --> 34:15.314
Okay, I'’m gonna have
to be your eyes.

34:15.357 --> 34:17.794
Okay, Riley, time
to make a move. Exit the closet.

34:17.838 --> 34:19.492
Make your way to the door.

34:37.249 --> 34:40.208
Oh, man, this is so cool.

34:40.252 --> 34:42.297
Just like Morpheus guiding Neo
through the Matrix.

34:42.341 --> 34:44.473
Yeah. I'’m glad
you'’re having fun, Bozer.

34:44.517 --> 34:46.780
Wait, wait, wait! Hide!

35:02.143 --> 35:02.970
Riley,

35:03.013 --> 35:04.972
he has a gun.

35:06.060 --> 35:07.888
:
Bozer, do something.

35:19.421 --> 35:21.119
[glass shatters,
car alarm blaring]

35:32.042 --> 35:35.611
Hey! What the hell
is your problem?!

35:35.655 --> 35:37.265
Teaching you a lesson!

35:37.309 --> 35:39.311
Tree nut allergies
are serious business!

35:39.354 --> 35:41.878
Are you insane?!

35:41.922 --> 35:44.490
Look what you just
did to my car.

35:44.533 --> 35:46.622
:
Bozer, I'’m out.

35:46.666 --> 35:48.929
You know what?

35:48.972 --> 35:51.192
I overreacted.

35:51.236 --> 35:53.629
My bad. My insurance will
take care of all of this.

35:53.673 --> 35:55.065
Happy Halloween.

35:58.199 --> 36:00.723
That drive is an exact duplicate
of Kettner'’s secret laptop,

36:00.767 --> 36:03.378
which was jam-packed
with stolen files.

36:03.422 --> 36:05.119
Not to mention digital artifacts

36:05.163 --> 36:07.687
proving he sent those files to a
handler in the Chinese military.

36:07.730 --> 36:09.384
More than enough
to put Kettner

36:09.428 --> 36:11.908
away for treason,
and well worth the dump truck

36:11.952 --> 36:15.173
of candy I apparently owe
your second cousin Calvin.

36:15.216 --> 36:17.740
So really good work, guys.

36:17.784 --> 36:21.179
Congratulations. You
may now get divorced.

36:24.617 --> 36:27.315
MacGYVER:
How far to the tunnels?

36:27.359 --> 36:30.710
Not far. We'’ll access them
through the mausoleum up ahead.

36:30.753 --> 36:34.192
Once we'’re below ground,
we'’re home free.

36:34.235 --> 36:36.324
So whose desecrated
final resting spot

36:36.368 --> 36:38.065
are we keeping
our eyes peeled for?

36:40.023 --> 36:42.156
Perdón.

36:46.247 --> 36:48.206
This way!

37:13.492 --> 37:15.102
MacGYVER:
Okay, they'’re gone.
We should move.

37:19.237 --> 37:20.716
This way.

37:38.212 --> 37:40.649
Through here. This leads to a
bodega on the edge of the city.

37:47.526 --> 37:48.962
OVERSIGHT:
How much longer?

37:49.005 --> 37:51.312
Less than a kilometer.

37:51.356 --> 37:52.922
What is it?

37:52.966 --> 37:55.229
It'’s a breeze.

37:55.273 --> 37:56.926
Someone opened
another entrance.

38:00.365 --> 38:02.932
They'’re in the tunnels.

38:12.290 --> 38:14.204
OVERSIGHT:
It'’s limestone.You couldn'’t possibly know that.

38:14.248 --> 38:16.294
Sure I could.
Just feel the bumpy edges.

38:16.337 --> 38:17.773
It'’s flint.

38:17.817 --> 38:19.253
No. It'’s not.
It'’s not gonna light.

38:19.297 --> 38:22.691
You were saying?Okay, smart-ass.

38:22.735 --> 38:25.215
GOMEZ: It won'’t be long
before Rafa finds us.

38:25.259 --> 38:25.955
We need to hurry!

39:00.512 --> 39:02.340
Nice.
Nice. Yeah.

39:02.383 --> 39:04.951
The gun. They heard the gunfire.
We have to run. This way.

39:04.994 --> 39:06.953
Okay.

39:22.621 --> 39:24.753
Gomez, wait.

39:24.797 --> 39:25.667
Angus!

39:28.453 --> 39:30.368
Angus?!MacGYVER:
Underground tunnels,

39:30.411 --> 39:33.893
even crude ones, are actually
complex engineering feats.

39:33.936 --> 39:35.982
For every foot
below the surface you go,

39:36.025 --> 39:38.419
there'’s a quarter ton of rock
and dirt above your head,

39:38.463 --> 39:40.856
which makes causing a collapse
as easy as pouring candle wax

39:40.900 --> 39:43.381
on a grenade and adhering it
to a support beam.

39:43.424 --> 39:45.513
The tricky part is...

39:45.557 --> 39:47.820
being somewhere else
when it all comes down.

39:54.479 --> 39:57.569
Angus?!

39:57.612 --> 40:00.093
Answer me!

40:05.533 --> 40:07.013
What are you waiting

40:07.056 --> 40:08.275
for, old man?
Let'’s get out of here.

40:08.318 --> 40:10.495
Come on.
I found another way out.

40:12.584 --> 40:14.542
Jack, maybe it'’s time to
start thinking about...

40:14.586 --> 40:16.936
Hey, hey, I'’m not leaving
this country without '’em. I...

40:16.979 --> 40:20.374
Ooh! I told you!

40:20.418 --> 40:21.810
Yeah, that'’s what
I'’m talking about.

40:21.854 --> 40:23.464
Mm-hmm!

40:23.508 --> 40:24.900
You guys really alive,
or am I...

40:24.944 --> 40:26.424
am I looking
at a ghost here, huh?

40:26.467 --> 40:27.512
Pretty sure.

40:27.555 --> 40:28.600
Stop! What are
you doing?
Huh?

40:28.643 --> 40:29.731
I'’m just... I'm
just checking.

40:29.775 --> 40:30.993
Relax. What? Good
to see you, too.

40:31.037 --> 40:33.126
Okay, so, Matty has cleared
a flight path

40:33.169 --> 40:34.910
to an airstrip
just over the border in Cali.

40:34.954 --> 40:36.477
The Phoenix jet'’s
gonna meet us there.

40:36.521 --> 40:39.262
Good. Sooner we get this guy
in an interrogation room,

40:39.306 --> 40:40.960
the better.
JACK:
Yeah.

40:41.003 --> 40:45.617
Oh, I'’m sorry. Mac, Big Mac,
this is Officer Cardoza.

40:45.660 --> 40:47.880
He was the only one brave enough
to stick his neck out

40:47.923 --> 40:48.837
to do the right thing here.

40:48.881 --> 40:50.752
Officer Cardoza, gracias.

40:50.796 --> 40:53.712
An honest cop? How
did I let that happen?

40:55.540 --> 40:59.108
Okay. Air Dalton flight
zero niner will be departing

40:59.152 --> 41:00.632
for the great
U. S. of A

41:00.675 --> 41:02.503
ASAP, so, please take a moment
to make sure your handcuffs

41:02.547 --> 41:04.984
are in the tight and
uncomfortable position.

41:05.027 --> 41:05.941
Good to see you boys.

41:08.161 --> 41:09.771
I thought we were past this.

41:09.815 --> 41:12.078
You'’re our prisoner,
not our guest.

41:14.297 --> 41:17.475
Don Gomez, say
good-bye to Mexico.

41:17.518 --> 41:19.955
Angus... I, uh...

41:21.217 --> 41:23.959
I want you
to understand something.

41:24.003 --> 41:25.787
You don'’t have to convince me
that grabbing Gomez

41:25.831 --> 41:27.223
to find Walsh is a worthy cause.

41:27.267 --> 41:29.487
I just wish you had been
up-front about it.

41:29.530 --> 41:31.184
You'’re right. I should
have. I'’m sorry.

41:31.227 --> 41:34.709
Your mother would
have loved this.

41:34.753 --> 41:38.626
Her only son going up
against a drug cartel?

41:38.670 --> 41:42.456
No, she would have been really
pissed at me about that, but

41:42.500 --> 41:46.373
us working side by side--
she would have been...

41:46.416 --> 41:50.943
Well, she is...
very proud of you, Angus.

41:50.986 --> 41:52.945
I hope so.

41:52.988 --> 41:55.208
Good.

41:55.251 --> 41:56.862
Well, let'’s get Gomez back home

41:56.905 --> 42:00.387
and figure out what rock
Walsh is hiding under.

42:03.912 --> 42:05.697
Enrique?

42:05.740 --> 42:07.568
What the hell did
you just do, man?

42:07.612 --> 42:11.093
I got justice.
