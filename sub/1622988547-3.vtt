00:04.421 --> 00:06.673
<i>Previously on</i>
The Republic of Sarah...

00:06.756 --> 00:08.675
A sizable deposit of coltan

00:08.758 --> 00:10.510
has been discovered
right here in Greylock.

00:10.593 --> 00:11.678
This morning,
Governor Taggert signed

00:11.761 --> 00:13.263
eminent domain paperwork,

00:13.346 --> 00:14.597
which gives Greylock's
public space

00:14.681 --> 00:15.849
to the state
of New Hampshire.

00:15.932 --> 00:17.475
They're gonna wipe Greylock
off the map.

00:17.559 --> 00:18.727
I know how we can
stop the drilling.

00:18.810 --> 00:20.603
What if we didn't belong
to New Hampshire?

00:20.687 --> 00:22.272
This town was never
legally claimed

00:22.355 --> 00:25.400
by either
of its national neighbors.

00:25.483 --> 00:27.610
(chuckles): Who's in charge
if the mayor quits?

00:27.694 --> 00:28.528
TYLER:
<i>Ms. Cooper. She saved us.</i>

00:28.611 --> 00:30.405
<i>She should be the leader.</i>

00:30.488 --> 00:33.324
Lydon can dig two mines.

00:33.408 --> 00:34.826
Grover, one of the mines
is going on your land.

00:34.909 --> 00:37.412
<i>Grover built that house himself.</i>

00:37.495 --> 00:39.789
It was his wedding gift
to Patience.

00:39.873 --> 00:41.791
This is an international
boundary now.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.668
Your border must
remain closed.

Well, it's official.

01:11.112 --> 01:12.822
We're completely cut off.

01:12.906 --> 01:14.991
Greylock PD
just checked all the roads

01:15.074 --> 01:16.493
that lead out of town.

01:16.576 --> 01:18.203
New Hampshire border
is closed to the south.

01:18.286 --> 01:19.788
Canadian border
is closed to the north.

01:19.871 --> 01:21.581
Governor Taggert
was not bluffing.

01:21.664 --> 01:22.415
We're completely cut off.

01:22.499 --> 01:24.042
Wait, how can she do that,

01:24.125 --> 01:25.585
legally?
Aren't there rules

01:25.668 --> 01:27.045
for how countries
have to treat each other?

01:27.128 --> 01:30.423
There are two basic steps
to becoming fully independent.

01:30.507 --> 01:32.342
One: say you're a country.

01:32.425 --> 01:34.552
Two: get other
countries to agree.

01:34.636 --> 01:36.888
Greylock is obviously
all over step one,

01:36.971 --> 01:38.515
but the U.S. is
dragging its feet on step two,

01:38.598 --> 01:41.309
and since they haven't
officially recognized us yet,

01:41.392 --> 01:43.520
we get no treaties,
no diplomacy,

01:43.603 --> 01:44.687
and no protection from Gail.

01:44.771 --> 01:45.855
CORINNE:
Okay, so,

01:45.939 --> 01:47.357
how do we get recognized?

01:45.939 --> 01:47.357
I'm gonna call

01:47.440 --> 01:48.817
the State Department
and find out.

01:48.900 --> 01:50.026
But it takes time,
which is something

01:50.109 --> 01:50.693
we don't have at the moment.

01:50.777 --> 01:51.694
So, for now,

01:51.778 --> 01:53.446
I'm gonna focus

01:53.530 --> 01:55.198
on forcing Governor Taggert
to open our border,

01:55.281 --> 01:56.825
or nobody's
getting out of Greylock.

01:56.908 --> 01:58.368
Nobody's coming in, either.

01:58.451 --> 01:59.786
My dad was just on the phone
with our dairy guy,

01:59.869 --> 02:01.162
and he says

02:01.246 --> 02:02.705
he won't deliver
to Greylock.

02:02.789 --> 02:04.582
He's worried his drivers
will get trapped here.

02:04.666 --> 02:08.169
But they can't close
the borders from our side.

02:08.253 --> 02:09.921
No, but they can stop anyone

02:10.004 --> 02:11.840
who comes in
from getting back out again.

02:11.923 --> 02:14.717
The governor would let her
own citizens get stranded here?

02:14.801 --> 02:16.469
If it means getting
her hands on our coltan.

02:16.553 --> 02:17.846
She's made it very clear
she's always gonna choose

02:17.929 --> 02:18.930
profit over people.

02:19.013 --> 02:21.391
If Greylock really is cut off

02:21.474 --> 02:22.600
from the rest
of the world, then...

02:22.684 --> 02:24.769
people who live here
can't get to work

02:24.853 --> 02:26.813
out there, people who live there
can't get to work out here.

02:26.896 --> 02:28.106
I mean, we can't get food.

02:28.189 --> 02:30.233
No medical supplies.

02:30.316 --> 02:31.818
Wait.
Josh has diabetes.

02:31.901 --> 02:32.735
I have to be able
to get insulin.

02:32.819 --> 02:34.404
I'll fix this.

02:34.487 --> 02:35.446
I'm gonna call

02:35.530 --> 02:36.447
every leader
in the area.

02:36.781 --> 02:38.533
I'm hoping I can get them
on our side

02:38.616 --> 02:41.411
so they can put pressure the
governor to do the right thing.

02:41.494 --> 02:43.079
Sounds like a lot of calls
to make. I'll-I'll help.

02:43.162 --> 02:44.747
No, I'm Greylock's leader.

02:44.831 --> 02:47.125

09:08.130 --> 09:08.965
Hey.

09:09.048 --> 09:10.633
How we doing
with the plan?

09:10.716 --> 09:12.718
Uh, Tim's bringing
Jason and Ashley,

09:12.802 --> 09:14.178
so that'll be 14.

09:14.262 --> 09:15.721
And then Katie got the stakes
from the garden center.

09:15.805 --> 09:17.640
Are you sure about this, Ty?

09:17.723 --> 09:18.224
It could be...

09:18.307 --> 09:20.309
you know, risky.

09:20.393 --> 09:22.645
It's riskier doing nothing.
Right?

09:22.728 --> 09:24.272
Yeah, we have to fight back.
We can't just

09:24.355 --> 09:26.232
let them lock us
inside our own borders.

09:26.565 --> 09:28.192
It's totally messed up.

09:26.565 --> 09:28.192
Ty.

09:28.276 --> 09:29.026
Oh.

09:29.110 --> 09:31.404
Here, last load.

09:29.110 --> 09:31.404
Cool.

09:32.655 --> 09:34.407
End of an era, huh?

09:37.702 --> 09:38.703
It's just a house.

09:41.080 --> 09:42.665
See you at the storage place.

09:42.748 --> 09:43.207
Thanks, Ty.
Thanks, girls.

09:42.748 --> 09:43.207
Bye.

09:43.291 --> 09:46.460
Thanks.

Oh, my God.

10:28.377 --> 10:29.170
Geez.

10:29.253 --> 10:31.464
(exhales sharply)

10:31.547 --> 10:32.882
Gonna give me
a heart attack, Mom.

10:32.965 --> 10:35.217
Just met his fiancée
at Sweetie Pie.

10:35.301 --> 10:36.886
She just strolled up to you
and said,

10:36.969 --> 10:39.847
"Hi, I'm engaged to your son"?

10:36.969 --> 10:39.847
No.

10:39.930 --> 10:41.057
She didn't mention Danny.

10:41.140 --> 10:43.434
She's wearing Iris' ring.

10:43.517 --> 10:46.145
The one Iris gave him
when she died.

10:46.228 --> 10:47.146
You can just call her Nana, Mom.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.231
We all liked her,
even if you didn't.

10:49.315 --> 10:51.192
How could Danny not tell us?

10:51.275 --> 10:53.861
You can't seriously
be asking that question.

10:53.944 --> 10:56.447
Mom, he didn't talk to us
for six years.

10:56.530 --> 10:59.241
He's only here now for work.

10:59.325 --> 11:00.785
Just 'cause he's back
doesn't mean we're gonna,

11:00.868 --> 11:03.245
like, suddenly be this
big, happy family.

11:03.329 --> 11:05.039
We never were
in the first place.

11:03.329 --> 11:05.039
I know.

11:05.122 --> 11:08.584
But he did come to me
about Lydon's blackmail plot,

11:08.668 --> 11:11.420
and I did the right thing.

11:11.504 --> 11:14.882
So I was hoping it opened
the door a little bit.

11:16.300 --> 11:17.760
He can't hold a grudge forever.

11:17.843 --> 11:20.429
Why not? He's gonna have the
scars you gave him forever.

11:23.182 --> 11:24.892
I know you're trying to change,

11:24.975 --> 11:26.936
and that's great.

11:27.019 --> 11:29.438
But you have to change for you,
not for Danny.

11:30.981 --> 11:34.110
And the best way
to do that is...

11:34.193 --> 11:36.070
to go to AA.

11:36.153 --> 11:36.946
So...
(chuckles)

11:37.029 --> 11:38.322
...for the thousandth time,

11:38.406 --> 11:42.118
this is the information

11:42.201 --> 11:43.869
for a local meeting.

11:42.201 --> 11:43.869
The last thing

11:43.953 --> 11:46.122
I need to do
is sit in a church basement

11:46.205 --> 11:47.456
and listen to a bunch
of plumbers

11:47.540 --> 11:49.667
cry about their problems.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.667
The last thing you need

11:49.750 --> 11:52.002
is to sit in your house alone

11:52.086 --> 11:53.421
with a new
fifth of whiskey

11:53.504 --> 11:54.755
you keep hiding
under the counter

11:54.839 --> 11:56.882
every time I throw
the old one away.

11:56.966 --> 11:58.008
Mom,

11:58.092 --> 12:00.761
go to the meeting.

12:11.063 --> 12:13.023
Where have you been?
I've been calling you.

12:13.107 --> 12:14.483
I'm sorry.
My phone died during another

12:14.567 --> 12:17.069
delightful round
of "Local Leader

12:17.153 --> 12:18.320
Not It."
Why are you

12:18.404 --> 12:20.406
in uniform? I thought
you worked this morning.

12:20.489 --> 12:22.032
They called me back in
to help with this mess

12:22.116 --> 12:23.117
with the teenagers.

12:23.200 --> 12:25.327
What mess with the teenagers?

12:25.411 --> 12:27.037
(indistinct chatter)

12:27.121 --> 12:29.081
AJ:
They got arrested
trying to cross the border.

12:29.165 --> 12:30.458
Oh, my God.

12:42.178 --> 12:43.512
Hi, Ms. Cooper.

12:47.349 --> 12:49.351
This was all just a big
misunderstanding. They probably

12:49.435 --> 12:51.353
didn't realize they were
on the wrong side of the border.

12:51.437 --> 12:52.813
They jumped our barriers
and shouted,

12:52.897 --> 12:55.983
"disobedience is the true
foundation of liberty" at us.

12:56.066 --> 12:57.526
Pretty sure
they knew.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.028
Okay, that's a
Henry David Thoreau quote,

12:59.111 --> 13:00.362
so at least
we know they're doing

13:00.446 --> 13:01.572
their English homework.

13:00.446 --> 13:01.572
Look,

13:01.655 --> 13:04.074
I have two teenagers
at home, so I get it.

13:04.158 --> 13:05.701
There aren't gonna
be any charges.

13:05.784 --> 13:07.453
We just deported
them back to you,

13:07.536 --> 13:09.455
you handle it.
But do us a favor

13:09.538 --> 13:11.874
and keep them on your side
from now on, hmm?

13:12.541 --> 13:13.876
Of course.

13:13.959 --> 13:16.754
Thank you.

13:13.959 --> 13:16.754
(phone vibrating)

13:19.298 --> 13:20.341
Governor Taggert.
Finally.

13:20.424 --> 13:22.301
Can we please sit down
and talk about

13:22.384 --> 13:23.302
this whole thing
like adults?

13:23.636 --> 13:25.221
I'll talk to you
like an adult, Sarah,

13:25.304 --> 13:27.056
when you start
acting like one.

13:27.139 --> 13:28.891
I just heard that there was
an assault on our border.

13:28.974 --> 13:30.893
It was just a few kids
with protest signs.

13:30.976 --> 13:32.561
It won't happen again.

13:32.645 --> 13:34.605
No, it won't,
because the SWAT team

13:34.688 --> 13:35.397
is on its way to Greylock
right now

13:35.481 --> 13:37.816
to reinforce our border.

13:37.900 --> 13:40.027
What? Gail, no,
wait a minute. No, no, no.

13:40.110 --> 13:42.112
My troops will be looking over
every inch of that land.

13:42.196 --> 13:43.989
If anyone so much as sets foot
across the border,

13:44.073 --> 13:46.408
they'll be charged
with illegal entry

13:46.492 --> 13:48.953
into the United States
and sent to federal prison.

13:49.036 --> 13:51.205
Come on, can't we figure out
some way for us

13:51.288 --> 13:52.498
to live in peace?

13:52.581 --> 13:53.582
I am just trying to help
my citizens.

13:53.916 --> 13:55.501
So am I, Sarah.

13:55.584 --> 13:58.003
I can do wonders for this state
with the money from that coltan.

13:58.087 --> 13:59.838
Okay, there's just
one problem, Gail:

13:59.922 --> 14:01.799
it's not your coltan.

13:59.922 --> 14:01.799
Not yet.

14:01.882 --> 14:03.759
Not ever.

14:01.882 --> 14:03.759
We'll see, Sarah.

14:25.281 --> 14:27.032
Hey, Ms. Cooper, uh,

14:27.116 --> 14:28.409
can we talk to you real quick?

14:28.492 --> 14:30.160
Yeah.
Always.

14:30.244 --> 14:33.914
Um, we wanted to apologize
for what we did today.

14:33.998 --> 14:35.249
Yeah, we're
really sorry.

14:35.332 --> 14:37.418
Maya, guys, what you did
today took guts.

14:37.501 --> 14:41.171
You saw an injustice, you tried
to fix it. I could never...

14:41.255 --> 14:42.631
(clears throat)

14:42.715 --> 14:45.092
I am very mad at you all
for what you did today.

14:45.175 --> 14:48.178
You should have known better.
It was totally out of line.

14:49.722 --> 14:53.183
(whispering):
I am so proud of you guys.

14:53.267 --> 14:55.144
But do me a favor

14:55.227 --> 14:57.438
and stay on our side
of the border from now on.

14:57.521 --> 15:00.566
I don't want to see
any of you in prison scrubs.

15:00.899 --> 15:02.610
I can tell you,
from experience,

15:02.693 --> 15:04.320
they chafe.

15:02.693 --> 15:04.320
(kids chuckle)

15:04.403 --> 15:07.072
So, what are you gonna
do about the border?

15:07.156 --> 15:10.534
I have, uh, plenty
of tricks up my sleeve.

15:13.454 --> 15:16.165
No.
You're joking.

15:16.248 --> 15:17.374
No. Listen, please,
just go with me for a second.

15:17.458 --> 15:19.335
Something Gail said this
morning got me thinking.

15:19.418 --> 15:21.503
She said,
"My troops will be watching

15:21.587 --> 15:24.048
every inch of that land."

15:24.131 --> 15:25.549
Land.

15:25.633 --> 15:27.426
But not water.

15:25.633 --> 15:27.426
Uh-huh.

15:27.509 --> 15:29.345
The governor has us surrounded,
we're completely landlocked,

15:29.428 --> 15:32.139
but we aren't waterlocked.
Look, I have a plan.

15:32.222 --> 15:34.558
The Woonsock flows along
our southern border.

15:34.642 --> 15:36.310
It starts here,

15:36.393 --> 15:37.186
passes under us here,
moves through two miles

15:37.269 --> 15:39.313
of New Hampshire
to our east,

15:39.396 --> 15:40.147
and then finally
arrives in...

15:40.230 --> 15:42.358
Maine.

15:40.230 --> 15:42.358
Maine. Yes, exactly.

15:42.441 --> 15:45.569
So, I called a friend
from college this morning.

15:45.653 --> 15:47.279
She and her family
are gonna put together

15:47.363 --> 15:48.739
a supply drop for the town.

15:48.822 --> 15:50.532
Just the essentials--
eggs, milk, bread.

15:50.616 --> 15:53.118
And I'm supposed to bring
them home in this?

15:50.616 --> 15:53.118
Mm-hmm.

15:53.202 --> 15:54.578
You're gonna cross the border
tonight, grab the supplies

15:54.662 --> 15:55.913
and come back.
Gail will never know.

15:54.662 --> 15:55.913
(groans)

15:55.996 --> 15:57.915
Sarah, why me?

15:55.996 --> 15:57.915
Because I trust you.

15:57.998 --> 15:58.874
And I know you know boats.

15:58.957 --> 16:01.418
Fishing with my dad as a kid is

16:01.502 --> 16:03.128
a little different from
riverboat smuggling in the dark.

16:03.212 --> 16:05.756
Okay, I know. Look.
I know it's crazy.

16:05.839 --> 16:08.217
It's completely crazy, I know.

16:08.300 --> 16:09.385
But, AJ...

16:09.468 --> 16:10.594
if you pull this off,

16:10.678 --> 16:13.180
it will give me a chance
to get the borders open.

16:13.263 --> 16:14.556
And in the meantime,
restocking Greylock's shelves

16:14.640 --> 16:16.809
will rob the governor
of her best weapon against us:

16:17.142 --> 16:18.268
fear.

16:19.978 --> 16:21.689
So, to recap.

16:19.978 --> 16:21.689
Mm-hmm.

16:21.772 --> 16:23.148
You want me, a police officer,

16:21.772 --> 16:23.148
Yeah.

16:23.232 --> 16:25.567
to illegally cross
an international boundary

16:25.651 --> 16:28.487
in this floating...
mid-life crisis,

16:28.570 --> 16:31.699
so that I can smuggle a bunch
of supplies back into Greylock

16:31.782 --> 16:34.159
and risk ruining
my professional reputation,

16:34.243 --> 16:35.744
and getting my hair wet.

16:38.163 --> 16:39.248
This is ridiculous.

16:39.331 --> 16:40.249
AJ, right now, we're standing

16:40.332 --> 16:41.834
in a country we invented.

16:42.167 --> 16:44.878
We're, like, way past
worrying about ridiculous.

16:48.132 --> 16:48.966
WOMAN:
...representatives are busy.

16:49.049 --> 16:52.219
You can't be serious, Sarah.

16:52.302 --> 16:54.763
I'm on hold
and AJ's on a boat.

16:54.847 --> 16:56.557
You asked for an update,
that's the update.

16:56.640 --> 16:58.142
I don't know
what else you want from me.

16:58.225 --> 16:59.768
I want you
to start talking to me.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.145
Why? You aren't
talking to me.

17:01.228 --> 17:02.271
What does that mean?

17:02.354 --> 17:04.857
I know you're engaged, Danny.

17:04.940 --> 17:06.400
Not that you felt
the need to tell me.

17:06.483 --> 17:07.651
I mean, guess I
shouldn't be surprised.

17:07.735 --> 17:08.652
I don't really know anything

17:08.986 --> 17:10.028
about your life in New York.

17:08.986 --> 17:10.028
Yeah,

17:10.112 --> 17:11.113
because my life in New York

17:11.196 --> 17:12.614
is mine, Sarah, unlike here,

17:12.698 --> 17:14.533
where you can't cross the street
without six people

17:14.616 --> 17:16.076
discussing it
in Sweetie Pie the next day.

17:16.160 --> 17:18.120
So, what-- you were just
never gonna tell me

17:18.203 --> 17:19.204
about your fiancée?

17:19.288 --> 17:20.122
I didn't think I had to.

17:20.205 --> 17:23.167
I knew Corinne would tell you.

17:23.250 --> 17:24.543
Corinne?

17:25.711 --> 17:27.379
Corinne knows?

17:27.463 --> 17:29.423
Of course she knows.
She told you, didn't she?

17:29.506 --> 17:31.175
Mom told me.

17:32.760 --> 17:36.096
'Cause apparently everyone
in this town knows but me.

17:47.524 --> 17:49.193
BELLA: I really like this.

17:49.902 --> 17:51.695
TYLER: Walking?

17:53.197 --> 17:55.240
Dating you.

17:55.324 --> 17:57.785
Like, two months ago,
I felt like...

17:57.868 --> 18:00.496
I didn't even
really matter.

18:00.579 --> 18:02.581
Like I could disappear,

18:02.664 --> 18:05.542
and my dad would be
the only person who noticed.

18:07.127 --> 18:08.837
Now I feel really good,
you know?

18:08.921 --> 18:10.798
Like I can do anything.

18:10.881 --> 18:13.258
Well, you can.

18:13.342 --> 18:13.759
You think so?

18:13.842 --> 18:16.720
Sure.

18:16.804 --> 18:20.057
I mean, we staged
a whole protest because of you.

18:20.140 --> 18:21.642
No, that was your idea.

18:21.725 --> 18:22.976
Well, yeah, but I never
would have had the courage

18:23.060 --> 18:25.729
to say anything till I met you.

18:28.774 --> 18:31.610
(phone vibrates)

18:33.946 --> 18:35.656
Hi, Dad.
How's New York?

18:35.739 --> 18:36.532
Did you get arrested?

18:36.865 --> 18:38.617
I just got out
of a four-hour meeting

18:38.700 --> 18:41.203
to a dozen messages from
your stepmom waiting for me.

18:41.286 --> 18:42.621
Okay, Dad,
we didn't get arrested.

18:42.704 --> 18:44.289
We just got sent back
to Greylock.

18:44.373 --> 18:45.874
I told you to stay away
from this independence crap.

18:45.958 --> 18:48.460
But, Dad, we were just...

18:48.544 --> 18:49.545
You know what, you and I
are gonna have a serious talk

18:49.628 --> 18:51.380

I did.

19:53.734 --> 19:55.736
What?

19:57.404 --> 20:00.616
Patience got cancer, and I
couldn't do anything about it.

20:01.867 --> 20:04.202
You gave my land
to Lydon Industries.

20:05.454 --> 20:06.788
Couldn't do anything about it.

20:06.872 --> 20:09.124
But this...

20:10.709 --> 20:13.545
Yeah, this I can control.

20:13.629 --> 20:15.297
This I can do something about.

20:16.506 --> 20:18.342
See, I built that house.

20:40.322 --> 20:42.824
Grover, you have to
talk to somebody.

20:42.908 --> 20:45.535
About Patience,
the house, all of it.

20:45.619 --> 20:46.286
It doesn't have to be me,

AJ: It's me.

21:12.020 --> 21:14.356
I have good news and bad news.

21:14.439 --> 21:16.024
Okay.
Good news, please.

21:16.358 --> 21:17.651
I got the supplies.

21:17.734 --> 21:19.319
Oh, thank God.

21:19.403 --> 21:20.696
What's the bad news?

21:20.779 --> 21:21.697
They're at the bottom
of the river.

21:21.780 --> 21:23.365
What?

21:23.448 --> 21:24.658
The boat sank on the way home.

21:24.741 --> 21:26.910
Oh, my God.
Are you okay?

21:26.994 --> 21:28.704
Well, just depends
on how you look at "okay."

21:28.787 --> 21:32.916
On one hand, I'm not
at the bottom of the river.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.876
On the other, I am in jail.

21:34.960 --> 21:36.712
And my hair is wet.

21:36.795 --> 21:39.798
Some cops from New Hampshire
fished me out of the river

21:39.881 --> 21:40.924
when the boat when down.

21:41.008 --> 21:42.968
I'm being held in Concord.

21:45.637 --> 21:46.930
<i>(knocking)</i>

21:55.480 --> 21:58.025
Whoa!
Hey, what was that?

21:58.108 --> 21:59.735
I'm busy.

21:59.818 --> 22:00.902
Too busy to tell me
what's bothering you?

22:00.986 --> 22:01.570
What's bothering me?

22:01.653 --> 22:03.905
Let's see, um...

22:03.989 --> 22:05.532
our town is surrounded
by guys who look

22:05.615 --> 22:07.034
like extras
from<i> The Hurt Locker,</i>

22:07.117 --> 22:09.745
our stores
are all empty,

22:09.828 --> 22:12.581
AJ is a prisoner,
Grover is an arsonist,

22:12.664 --> 22:15.542
and to top it all
off, my best friend

22:15.625 --> 22:16.752
found out that my
brother is engaged

22:16.835 --> 22:19.713
and, for some reason,
decided not to tell me.

22:20.756 --> 22:22.591
I...

22:22.674 --> 22:23.925
(stomps)

22:24.009 --> 22:25.761
I guess I thought
that Danny would tell you.

22:25.844 --> 22:26.970
Okay, well,
he didn't.

22:27.054 --> 22:28.805
Shocker.

22:28.889 --> 22:31.558
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to go explain

22:31.641 --> 22:33.852
to a roomful of people that
they won't be getting the food

22:33.935 --> 22:35.687
that I promised them
because the boat

22:35.771 --> 22:37.272
that had our cargo on it sank.

22:38.607 --> 22:41.318
Yeah, I know
how insane that sounds.

22:41.401 --> 22:42.903
You can let yourself
out, Corinne.

22:42.986 --> 22:44.738
(door closes)

22:44.821 --> 22:46.948
MAYA:
The video from our protest
has only been up an hour,

22:47.032 --> 22:49.076
but we already have
a ton of likes.

22:49.159 --> 22:50.952
Has your dad see this?

22:49.159 --> 22:50.952
Seen it?

22:51.036 --> 22:53.288
He posted it to his own page
five minutes after I got home.

22:53.371 --> 22:55.791
Your dad's so cool.

22:55.874 --> 22:57.834
My dad's still the guy who
does surprise inspections

22:57.918 --> 22:59.961
in my bedroom like we're
in the freaking Army.

23:00.045 --> 23:01.880
I don't know,
at least he supports you.

23:01.963 --> 23:04.800
My dad's losing his mind
about this protest.

23:04.883 --> 23:07.010
It's almost like he has
this list in his head

23:07.094 --> 23:08.637
of all these things I'm supposed
to be, and he freaks out

23:08.720 --> 23:11.807
as soon as I get near anything
that isn't on it.

23:11.890 --> 23:13.016
So talk to him.

23:13.100 --> 23:13.975
Tell him you have
your own list

23:14.059 --> 23:15.477
of things
you want to be.

23:15.560 --> 23:17.062
Look, I'm sure, deep down,

23:17.145 --> 23:18.730
all your dad wants is
for you to be happy.

23:18.814 --> 23:20.148
So tell him
this makes you happy.

23:20.232 --> 23:21.983
Tell him you're done being
Little Miss Prissy Pants

23:22.067 --> 23:23.652
and you want to make a
difference in the world.

23:23.735 --> 23:24.861
Most dads would be pumped

23:24.945 --> 23:26.363
to hear their daughter say that.

23:26.446 --> 23:28.532
Maybe you're right.

23:28.615 --> 23:29.241
Of course I'm right.

23:29.324 --> 23:31.076
I'm a genius.

23:33.161 --> 23:35.163
(car horns honking)

23:35.497 --> 23:38.291
(phone buzzing)

23:41.628 --> 23:45.215
Vince. What's going on?
What is this?

23:45.549 --> 23:47.008
An hour ago, the governor
announced she's granting

23:47.092 --> 23:48.844
political asylum to anyone
who wants to leave Greylock.

23:48.927 --> 23:51.346
Traffic out of town's backed up
for half a mile.

23:51.429 --> 23:53.181
Political asylum?
Is she serious?

23:53.265 --> 23:54.808
What, does she think
it's suddenly Cold War Berlin

23:54.891 --> 23:56.268
around here?

23:56.351 --> 23:57.853
Is this, like,
a permanent thing?

23:57.936 --> 23:59.771
Like, are the, are the borders
open for good now?

23:59.855 --> 24:02.274
One-time offer. Once they
process this initial wave,

24:02.357 --> 24:04.901
they're gonna shut down again.

24:04.985 --> 24:06.027
No going back
and forth.

24:06.111 --> 24:07.696
(woman shouting indistinctly)

24:06.111 --> 24:07.696
Whoa!

24:07.779 --> 24:08.446
This doesn't make any sense.

24:08.530 --> 24:10.157
Why would Gail do this?

24:10.240 --> 24:13.118
(horns honking)

24:15.620 --> 24:17.455
Corinne.

24:17.539 --> 24:18.039
What's going on? Is Josh okay?

24:18.123 --> 24:19.583
(stammers)

24:19.666 --> 24:22.085
He's been puking
all morning, and I,

24:22.169 --> 24:24.171
I called the doctor, he told me
to take him to the hospital.

24:24.254 --> 24:25.297
They're gonna get blood work
done. Just, with his diabetes,

24:25.380 --> 24:27.382
you know,
you never know, so...

24:27.465 --> 24:29.926
I, uh, I tried to call you.

24:30.010 --> 24:30.802
I know. I should have,
I should have picked up,

24:30.886 --> 24:32.679
but I was... I'm so...

24:32.762 --> 24:33.305
I'm sorry.

24:32.762 --> 24:33.305
(man shouting)

24:33.388 --> 24:35.098
You should go.

24:35.182 --> 24:36.433
Go, go, go, go, go.

24:38.977 --> 24:40.061
Bye, sweetie.

24:40.145 --> 24:41.563
Feel better.

24:48.028 --> 24:48.904
TYLER:
Hey, Ms. Cooper.

24:49.237 --> 24:51.573
We thought you could use
a little pick-me-up.

24:51.656 --> 24:52.991
How's it going?

24:51.656 --> 24:52.991
Oh, thanks, guys.

24:53.074 --> 24:56.036
Um...

24:56.119 --> 24:57.579
it's going, yeah.

24:57.662 --> 24:59.247
I'm just, I'm trying to figure
this whole thing out.

24:59.331 --> 25:01.583
MAYA: You know, just 'cause
you're our leader doesn't mean

25:01.666 --> 25:03.752
you have to keep doing
everything by yourself.

25:03.835 --> 25:04.502
Yeah, I mean, what about
all those activists

25:04.586 --> 25:06.880
you taught us about?

25:06.963 --> 25:09.216
Alice Paul and Mother Jones
and Sylvia Rivera.

25:09.299 --> 25:10.926
None of them
worked alone.

25:11.009 --> 25:12.093
They all had people
behind them.

25:12.177 --> 25:13.637
If they didn't,
they never would've

25:13.720 --> 25:14.721
made the difference they did.

25:14.804 --> 25:15.931
Even LeBron needs teammates.

25:16.014 --> 25:17.140
Why can't you be
like normal kids

25:17.224 --> 25:19.809
and sleep through class?

25:19.893 --> 25:21.102
Greylock's story is
all over the Internet.

25:21.186 --> 25:23.605
A lot of people are talking
about our protest

25:23.688 --> 25:25.148
and how unfair
the governor is being.

25:28.026 --> 25:30.946
That's why the governor opened
the border temporarily.

25:31.029 --> 25:32.364
It was your protest.

25:32.447 --> 25:35.617
She must've been getting
pressure from people who saw it.

25:35.700 --> 25:37.118
And that was just a bunch
of teenagers with signs.

25:37.202 --> 25:38.954
Think about what we could do
with a whole town.

25:39.037 --> 25:40.872
Okay, you realize
there's an entire army

25:40.956 --> 25:42.249
outside our border, right?

25:42.332 --> 25:44.793
There's an entire army
within our border, too.

25:44.876 --> 25:48.129
Just needs a general.

25:48.213 --> 25:51.299
♪ Talking 'bout the revolution ♪

25:51.383 --> 25:53.969

you're gonna do... ♪

No, you can't spend time
with my fiancée.

26:28.003 --> 26:30.505
No, you're not invited to
the wedding and, no, you're not,

26:30.588 --> 26:32.007
and never will be,
welcome in New York.

26:32.090 --> 26:33.717
Me getting married
is not a chance

26:33.800 --> 26:35.885
for you to crawl
back into my life.

26:35.969 --> 26:37.554
It's a chance for me to remind
you to stay the hell out of it.

26:37.637 --> 26:39.514
Okay, wait, whoa!

26:40.932 --> 26:42.017
Wait.

26:43.643 --> 26:45.812
I know what I did.

26:45.895 --> 26:46.730
And I know who I was.

26:46.813 --> 26:49.107
And I'm not that person anymore.

26:49.190 --> 26:51.067
Which person you talking about?

26:51.151 --> 26:53.028
The one who threw bottles

26:53.111 --> 26:54.654
at my head or the one
who hit me with a belt?

26:54.738 --> 26:57.782
Yes, I made terrible,
terrible mistakes.

26:57.866 --> 27:00.201
Mm.

26:57.866 --> 27:00.201
I was lost

27:00.285 --> 27:02.037
when your father left us.

27:02.120 --> 27:04.289
He didn't leave us.
You pushed him out.

27:06.416 --> 27:09.294
I was a mess.

27:09.377 --> 27:11.921
But it is different
now-- I've changed.

27:12.005 --> 27:14.090
I'm not that person anymore.
I'm sober.

27:14.174 --> 27:15.884
(laughs)
You're sober?

27:15.967 --> 27:17.719
Since when?

27:17.802 --> 27:20.221
When was the last time
you had a drink?

27:21.139 --> 27:23.224
(scoffs)

27:23.308 --> 27:25.185
That's what I thought.

27:25.268 --> 27:27.979
A snake that sheds
its skin is still a snake.

27:28.063 --> 27:29.731
(door slams)

27:34.152 --> 27:35.779
Danny?

27:35.862 --> 27:39.240
Please, if we
could just talk?

27:39.324 --> 27:41.493
I know that I hurt you,
I'm sorry.

27:41.826 --> 27:43.995
(knocking)

27:41.826 --> 27:43.995
If you can just
give me a minute.

27:46.122 --> 27:48.625
Please just let
me talk to you.

27:48.708 --> 27:51.920
Open the door, Danny!

27:52.003 --> 27:53.380
(distorted):
I won't go away
until you open up.

27:53.463 --> 27:56.341
(pounding on door)

28:00.178 --> 28:01.429
(muffled):
I'm here, babe...

28:03.431 --> 28:05.433
(pounding on door)

28:03.431 --> 28:05.433
We can talk about this.

28:08.019 --> 28:09.354
I'm your mother.

28:09.437 --> 28:11.064
And you're not gonna cut me
out of your life.

28:12.065 --> 28:13.608
Of course we can cut you out.

28:13.691 --> 28:15.402
That's what you do to cancer.

28:15.485 --> 28:16.986
I would like to talk to my son.

28:17.070 --> 28:18.446
Well, he doesn't want
to talk to you.

28:18.530 --> 28:20.907
Not now. Not ever.
Not after what you did.

28:20.990 --> 28:25.203
You will never have
a relationship with Danny.

28:25.286 --> 28:28.081
And that's a real shame,
because he's wonderful.

28:28.164 --> 28:29.791
He's smart

28:29.874 --> 28:31.835
and he's funny and he's caring.

28:31.918 --> 28:33.503
And just in case you thought
any of that was because of you,

28:33.837 --> 28:35.130
it's not.

28:35.213 --> 28:37.173
He's all those things
in spite of you.

28:39.884 --> 28:43.513
You can leave now, and if you
ever come knocking on this door

28:43.847 --> 28:45.098
again...

28:45.181 --> 28:47.684
I will give you
a few scars of your own.

28:58.778 --> 29:00.196
SARAH:
<i>I need your help.</i>

29:00.280 --> 29:02.115
For the past few days,
I've been trying

29:02.198 --> 29:03.950
to reopen our borders.

29:04.033 --> 29:06.244
Nothing has worked.

29:06.327 --> 29:09.831
Talking with some
of my former students today,

29:09.914 --> 29:10.999
I realized why.

29:11.082 --> 29:14.169
All of my solutions
to fix the problem

29:14.252 --> 29:17.005
started with "I"

29:17.088 --> 29:18.381
instead of "we."

29:18.465 --> 29:21.301
<i>That changes right now.</i>

29:21.384 --> 29:24.846
<i>I might not be able to get</i>
<i>the border open, but we can.</i>

29:24.929 --> 29:26.723
<i>"We" is stronger than "I."</i>

29:26.806 --> 29:28.183
<i>"We" is braver than "I."</i>

29:28.266 --> 29:30.477
"We..."

29:30.560 --> 29:32.395
is invincible.

29:32.479 --> 29:35.106
<i>Governor Taggert wants</i>
<i>our coltan.</i>

29:35.190 --> 29:37.358
<i>And she believes that because</i>
<i>we live on the wrong side</i>

29:37.442 --> 29:39.194
<i>of an invisible line,</i>

29:39.277 --> 29:41.863
<i>it's okay</i>
<i>to destroy us to get it.</i>

29:41.946 --> 29:45.700
<i>But we are going to show</i>
<i>the world that she's wrong.</i>

29:45.783 --> 29:47.076
<i>This afternoon we'll gather</i>

29:47.160 --> 29:49.913
<i>at the southern tip</i>
<i>of Jefferson Road</i>

29:49.996 --> 29:53.166
<i>and, together, step over</i>
<i>the border into New Hampshire.</i>

29:53.249 --> 29:56.252
(crowd shouting, clamoring)

29:53.249 --> 29:56.252
<i>This will not be easy</i>

29:56.336 --> 29:59.130
<i>and there may be</i>
<i>serious consequences</i>

29:59.214 --> 30:01.382
<i>for what we're about to do.</i>

30:01.466 --> 30:03.176
<i>But if Greylock is</i>
<i>going to survive,</i>

30:03.259 --> 30:06.346
<i>we need to remind the world</i>
<i>that lines on a map</i>

30:06.429 --> 30:08.097
<i>are not what define us.</i>

30:08.181 --> 30:10.058
<i>Compassion defines us.</i>

30:10.141 --> 30:13.978
<i>Kindness, friendship, fidelity.</i>

30:14.062 --> 30:16.231
<i>Love is what defines us.</i>

30:16.314 --> 30:20.401
<i>And so let us come together</i>
<i>in peaceful protest</i>

30:20.485 --> 30:24.072
<i>and appeal to the better angels</i>
<i>of our neighbors.</i>

Once people realized the true

31:06.698 --> 31:08.074
the governor was
promising them,

31:08.157 --> 31:09.534
they stopped supporting

31:35.059 --> 31:39.188
I didn't want to tell you
how I found out.

31:39.272 --> 31:40.607
How'd you find out?

31:41.524 --> 31:43.276
A couple of days ago, I...

31:44.902 --> 31:48.698
...went, uh, to his hotel room,
and when he answered the door,

31:49.032 --> 31:49.824
Piper was there.

31:49.907 --> 31:52.535

I don't know. It doesn't matter.
It's-it's over.

31:56.080 --> 31:58.666
He's clearly moved on
and so have I.

31:58.750 --> 32:01.336
Look, the point is,
is that I'm sorry.

32:01.419 --> 32:02.128
Me, too.

32:02.211 --> 32:03.880
GUARD:
Cooper.

32:03.963 --> 32:05.506
You're free to go.

32:05.590 --> 32:07.050
Seriously?

32:05.590 --> 32:07.050
All charges have
been dropped.

32:07.133 --> 32:09.344
And the borders
have been reopened.

32:09.427 --> 32:11.220
(laughs)

32:09.427 --> 32:11.220

Greylock was being treated,

32:17.185 --> 32:19.562
with some calling for
Governor Taggert's resignation.

32:19.646 --> 32:21.356
This, combined with her already
sagging poll numbers,

32:21.439 --> 32:24.192
ultimately leaves her with...

32:21.439 --> 32:24.192
ASSISTANT:
Hey, Ms. Cooper!

32:24.275 --> 32:27.487
I'm so sorry, Governor,
but I couldn't stop her.

32:27.570 --> 32:29.072
Nobody can, apparently.

32:29.155 --> 32:31.532
Thank you.

32:31.616 --> 32:34.077
(laughs softly)

32:34.160 --> 32:35.203
You here to gloat?

32:35.286 --> 32:35.912
I'm here to make you an offer.

32:35.995 --> 32:37.538
And what is that?

32:37.622 --> 32:39.207
Peace.

32:39.290 --> 32:40.375
No more fighting between
New Hampshire and Greylock.

you leave us alone.

a billion dollars' worth

32:45.546 --> 32:46.631
of civic improvement
without a fight.

32:46.714 --> 32:48.341
I know.

32:48.424 --> 32:52.220
The thing is, Gail,
we did fight and you lost.

32:52.303 --> 32:54.681
Let me tell you
a little secret.

32:54.764 --> 32:59.185
Leadership-- real leadership--

32:59.268 --> 33:01.896

when to follow.

33:01.979 --> 33:04.399

33:06.317 --> 33:08.569
You're gonna call
your buddies in Quebec

33:08.653 --> 33:11.531
and tell them to open
our northern border.

33:11.614 --> 33:13.741
Then you're gonna talk
to the State Department

33:13.825 --> 33:15.535
and help Greylock
start the process

33:15.618 --> 33:17.578
of getting officially
recognized.

33:17.662 --> 33:20.415
In exchange,
I will help you save face

33:20.498 --> 33:23.626
by holding a joint press
conference where you can take

33:23.710 --> 33:26.045

Okay.

Why didn't you tell Sarah
you're getting married?

33:44.689 --> 33:47.275
I thought you would.
You're her best friend.

33:47.358 --> 33:50.069
You're her brother
and it's-it's your engagement.

33:50.153 --> 33:52.155
Which, you know,
congratulations, by the way.

you hoped I'd become a strong,

36:14.172 --> 36:16.924

well, I am one.

I'm not trying to stop you

36:28.978 --> 36:30.730
I'm trying to help you do it.

36:33.941 --> 36:35.359
"Cabot Hall." What is this?

36:35.443 --> 36:37.486
One of the best boarding schools
in the country.

36:37.570 --> 36:40.489
The kind of place that churns
out judges, doctors, CEOs,

36:40.573 --> 36:43.659
senators, Nobel Prize winners.

36:43.743 --> 36:45.578
You want to change the world?

36:45.661 --> 36:47.330
You really want to change it?

36:47.413 --> 36:48.956
Cabot will give you
the tools to do it.

36:49.040 --> 36:51.959
Dad, this place
is in Connecticut.

36:52.043 --> 36:53.794
Mm-hmm.

36:53.878 --> 36:56.464
You know, and I have a friend
at work who's a trustee.

36:56.547 --> 36:57.840
And they have an open bed

36:57.924 --> 36:59.592
and he managed
to grab it for you.

36:59.675 --> 37:01.510
We're gonna drop you off
next week.

37:03.721 --> 37:05.473
No.

37:05.556 --> 37:08.684
Dad, no. I'm not going
to boarding school.

37:08.768 --> 37:09.852
Bella.

37:08.768 --> 37:09.852
I am sorry.

37:09.936 --> 37:13.189
Okay, forget everything

37:13.272 --> 37:14.732

37:17.151 --> 37:17.735
Please.

37:17.151 --> 37:17.735
It's done, Bella.

37:17.818 --> 37:20.529
Dad, please.

37:24.033 --> 37:26.160

That's one hell
of a view.

37:38.881 --> 37:41.259
(sputters)

37:44.845 --> 37:48.432
I, uh, heard your speech.

37:49.684 --> 37:52.395
You know, the whole
"I" versus "we" thing?

37:52.478 --> 37:55.898
I know you were talking
about Greylock, but...

37:55.982 --> 37:58.109
it got me thinking
about things.

37:58.192 --> 38:01.028
With Patience and, uh,

38:01.362 --> 38:02.947
losing the house.

38:04.615 --> 38:07.034
I can't keep carrying
that around by myself.

38:07.785 --> 38:08.995
I do need help.

38:09.078 --> 38:11.372
I do need to start

38:11.455 --> 38:13.457
talking to someone about things.

38:16.711 --> 38:19.964
So, um, have you thought
about what comes next?

38:21.132 --> 38:22.591
I mean, like, where
you're gonna live?

38:22.675 --> 38:26.345
Lydon's gonna build you a house
anyplace you want.

38:26.429 --> 38:30.433
I was thinking maybe
somewhere near the lake.

38:30.516 --> 38:32.685
The lake. Our lake?

38:32.768 --> 38:34.979
Of course our lake.

38:36.147 --> 38:37.857
You know I can't leave Greylock.

38:37.940 --> 38:39.567
Why not?

38:39.650 --> 38:40.776
You know,
my job's here.

38:41.861 --> 38:43.654
My friends are here and...

38:43.738 --> 38:45.448
you're here.

38:50.745 --> 38:53.539
Just give me time, Sarah.

38:55.666 --> 38:58.085
I just got to figure things out.

38:59.754 --> 39:01.338
Got to figure me out.

39:02.423 --> 39:04.383
I'm here whenever you're ready.

ELLEN:
<i>Hi, my name is Ellen.</i>

39:15.770 --> 39:17.355
I'm an alcoholic.

39:17.438 --> 39:18.773
Welcome, Ellen.
Hi, Ellen.

39:18.856 --> 39:20.941
At this moment, that's probably
the only thing about me

39:21.025 --> 39:23.444
I know for sure.

39:24.945 --> 39:26.405
Well, I know
who I would like to be.

39:26.489 --> 39:29.742
I'd like to be caring,
compassionate.

39:30.409 --> 39:33.120
Uh, dependable.

39:33.204 --> 39:35.998
I'd like to be a friend,
an ally.

39:36.957 --> 39:39.126
I would like to be a mother.

39:43.005 --> 39:47.676
Those... things feel
a very long way off.

39:47.760 --> 39:48.803
Um...

39:48.886 --> 39:50.638
so I'm here today because...

39:53.599 --> 39:55.351
I'm here because...

39:56.936 --> 40:00.481
I'm here.

40:00.564 --> 40:02.149
For now, that's enough.
