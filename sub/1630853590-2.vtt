<i>Couch. Lap. Play.</i>

00:06.963 --> 00:08.312
You want to play?

00:08.356 --> 00:10.271
You want to play on my lap?

00:10.314 --> 00:12.055
Or the couch?

00:12.099 --> 00:14.840
<i>Eat. Car. Car.</i>

00:14.884 --> 00:16.494
Now you're just
fucking with me.

00:16.538 --> 00:18.192
Girl's trip!

00:18.235 --> 00:20.759
Gentle.
Morning energy, please.

00:20.803 --> 00:23.371
I've been up since 3:30 am.
I've already had dinner.

00:25.808 --> 00:28.115
Y'know how we've always
fantasized about

00:28.158 --> 00:31.553
touring the regional offices in
the lower northeastern region?

00:31.596 --> 00:33.424
<i>- No.</i>
- Poison groundwater?

00:33.468 --> 00:36.558
Interspecial dating?
'70s architecture?

00:36.601 --> 00:38.081
Hard pass. Mere.

00:38.125 --> 00:40.866
It's just two best friends
hitting the road,

00:40.910 --> 00:43.695
eating snacks, harmonizing
to songs from my aughts mix.

00:43.739 --> 00:45.436
And best of all,
you don't have a choice

00:45.480 --> 00:47.221
because I'm your boss, technically. Technically.

00:47.264 --> 00:49.136
Car's packed
and ready to go!

00:49.179 --> 00:51.660
Oh, good,
printed directions.

00:51.703 --> 00:53.096
Where the hell's
Buttzville?

00:53.140 --> 00:54.793
It's where we make
The Lady Pump.

00:54.837 --> 00:56.491
The what?

00:56.534 --> 00:58.449
From the Little Miss Sebben
personal protection line.

00:58.493 --> 00:59.972
It's A pink shotgun
for the gal

01:00.016 --> 01:02.323
who wants to look chic
downing a grouse.

01:02.366 --> 01:04.629
They'll let us rack
a couple, you know.

01:04.673 --> 01:06.109
Fine.
I'm in.

01:06.153 --> 01:07.937
Why didn't you lead
with the guns?

01:07.980 --> 01:09.373
You said it was urgent?

01:09.417 --> 01:10.983
Yep.
We're going to Buttzville.

01:11.027 --> 01:13.334
Wow, pegging really
has gone mainstream.

01:13.377 --> 01:16.511
What's pegging?

01:16.554 --> 01:19.253
Oh. The town.
Rack a couple for me.

01:19.296 --> 01:22.212
Ugh, it's south of Assburg?
I'm back out.

01:22.256 --> 01:26.216
Come on, we never spend any time
where it's just us girls.

01:28.610 --> 01:32.004
Charlie, as much I'd love
a contralto in the car,

01:32.048 --> 01:34.790
I'm gonna need you to hold
down the fort while we're gone.

01:34.833 --> 01:37.793
I now pronounce you interim
CEO of Sebben & Sebben.

01:37.836 --> 01:40.404
Oh, oh, oh, wait, wait.

01:40.448 --> 01:42.493
Okay, I know where
this thing's been.

01:42.537 --> 01:43.799
Buttzville.

01:43.842 --> 01:45.627

01:45.670 --> 01:47.063

Mmm.
Girl's trip?

01:55.419 --> 01:57.813
I told you these outfits
made sense.

01:57.856 --> 02:01.295
Gillian, can you give Birdcat
his shots while I'm away?

02:01.338 --> 02:03.601
It would be my great honor.

02:03.645 --> 02:07.736
You and you --
co and dependent.

02:07.779 --> 02:09.433
One shot every
25 minutes.

02:09.477 --> 02:11.174
He will resist.

02:11.218 --> 02:15.047
But if he's a good boy,
you can give him his spankys.

02:16.353 --> 02:19.400
We could always
just put her down.

02:19.443 --> 02:21.184
Charlie: Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
Yeah, yeah.

02:21.228 --> 02:23.708
I hear you,
but you can't run this.

02:23.752 --> 02:25.362
She's all chin.

02:28.322 --> 02:31.586
Gillian, text Judy's new
headshot to "The Times."

02:31.629 --> 02:33.327
Ow!
What new headshot?

02:33.370 --> 02:34.589
Ow!

02:35.894 --> 02:37.113
Oh.

02:39.420 --> 02:41.813
Oh, my God.
It's time.

02:41.857 --> 02:43.902
Gillian,
come in here, please.

02:43.946 --> 02:46.166
Ow! Can it wait?!

02:46.209 --> 02:48.255
<i>I've got</i> <i>

02:50.344 --> 02:52.215
Yes? Aah!

02:52.259 --> 02:54.217
Oh...
You'll need this.

03:00.267 --> 03:03.748

Aah!

03:16.152 --> 03:18.241
through my Rejuvication process.

03:18.285 --> 03:20.765
And special thanks for not
pawning the whole thing off

03:20.809 --> 03:23.115
on that dipshit, Gillian.

03:23.159 --> 03:24.639
<i>- Hi, Gillian.</i>
- Hello.

03:24.682 --> 03:28.033
Every 19 years for the past
thousand or so,

03:28.077 --> 03:30.775
I, like the versions
of me before me,

03:30.819 --> 03:36.128
shed my old skin and emerge a
more evolved version of myself.

03:36.172 --> 03:37.782
<i>It keeps me at the top</i> <i>
of my game</i>

03:37.826 --> 03:40.220
<i>and staves off any fine lines.</i>

03:40.263 --> 03:43.397
You said it was exfoliants
and river hooch. Over.

03:43.440 --> 03:45.355
<i>Don't make me come out there.</i>

03:45.399 --> 03:48.271
<i>During stage one, it's vital</i> <i>
to keep my sack damp.</i>

03:48.315 --> 03:49.838
<i>Using the provided ass bag,</i>

03:49.881 --> 03:52.144
<i>simply hose my sack</i> <i>
every eight minutes</i>

03:52.188 --> 03:54.016
<i>and keep</i> <i>
the walkie charged.</i>

03:54.059 --> 03:55.452
<i>Khaire!</i>

04:00.501 --> 04:04.156
If feces be the food of love,
play on.

04:04.200 --> 04:07.159
You got O'Brien.

04:07.203 --> 04:08.987
I told you never to
call me here.

04:09.031 --> 04:10.902
Okay, well, maybe I forgot to.

04:10.946 --> 04:12.991
I understand.
Thank you.

04:13.035 --> 04:14.689
And never call me here.

04:18.214 --> 04:20.608
Boys?
Meet me in the Nest.

04:22.392 --> 04:23.959
My source in the parking deck

04:24.002 --> 04:26.266
tells me the power three
have left the building.

04:26.309 --> 04:28.659
And it's our time to implement
some experimental ideas

04:28.703 --> 04:32.359
that the man -- Judy --
says are too hot for prime time.

04:32.402 --> 04:34.926
So who's down for blowing
the roof off Sebben & Sebben?

04:34.970 --> 04:36.711
Question:
Did you mean to invite me?

04:36.754 --> 04:39.104
Because sometimes people think
they're texting Paul R.

04:39.148 --> 04:40.410
and they're disappointed.

04:40.454 --> 04:42.194
I just needed
a third set of balls.

04:42.238 --> 04:43.500
Uh-huh.

04:43.544 --> 04:45.850
By "set" do you mean
"a pair" because...

04:45.894 --> 04:47.678
So, every day, some Tom,

04:47.722 --> 04:49.637
Dick, or Harriet
makes a dumbass comment

04:49.680 --> 04:51.508
or unwanted advance,
word gets out,

04:51.552 --> 04:53.205
and they get cancelled,
we get sued,

04:53.249 --> 04:54.598
and someone
has to clean up the mess.

04:54.642 --> 04:56.121
Please, charge that.

04:56.165 --> 04:57.862
That's why I've perfected
a new technology.

04:57.906 --> 04:59.473
Ahem.

04:59.516 --> 05:02.389
That's why mostly Evie
perfected a new technology.

05:02.432 --> 05:04.869
We track employee's online
footprint to predict

05:04.913 --> 05:07.481
inappropriate behavior
seconds before it happens.

05:07.524 --> 05:09.874
Like, in six seconds,
Paul will post

05:09.918 --> 05:11.833
that he invented
Taco Tuesday.

05:11.876 --> 05:15.967
Now we can stop cancellations
by <i>precanceling</i> the offender.

05:17.404 --> 05:21.233
And ethics are in the gray area,
right where they belong.

05:21.277 --> 05:24.541
FYI, anyone asks questions,
and I will drop a dime

05:24.585 --> 05:27.370
on all of you so fast
it'll make your nuts drop.

05:27.414 --> 05:28.763
Well, one of 'em.

05:28.806 --> 05:30.504
Is she going to be here
the whole time?

05:30.547 --> 05:33.942
'Cause according to my book
of Guy Rules, no ladies allowed!

05:33.985 --> 05:36.510
It is literally illegal
to say that.

05:36.553 --> 05:38.512
Get out! Get out!
Get out!

05:38.555 --> 05:41.166
Get out of my room, Tiffany,
or I'm gonna tell mom!

05:41.210 --> 05:42.516
Gotta go anyway.

05:42.559 --> 05:45.736
Ballet recital,
in case anyone cares.

05:45.780 --> 05:49.305
Yeah,
that won't be happening.

05:49.349 --> 05:51.525
So, are there risks involved?
Yes.

05:51.568 --> 05:52.917
Is it worth it?
No.

05:52.961 --> 05:54.266
Are we going to have
some fun?

05:54.310 --> 05:55.833
Abso-fuckin'-lutely.

05:55.877 --> 05:58.401
I've always struggled connecting
with men until now.

05:58.445 --> 06:00.272
Look at us!
The trinity!

06:00.316 --> 06:01.926
Thought I invited
Paul R.

06:01.970 --> 06:03.885
Here's the bean dip.

06:03.928 --> 06:06.627
Precanceling
looks a lot like kidnapping...

06:06.670 --> 06:08.280
because it is.

06:08.324 --> 06:10.587
Precancel alert:
Brad from BizDev is about

06:10.631 --> 06:13.416
to initiate a "lean and creep."

06:13.460 --> 06:15.331
<i>Bag 'em and drag 'em.</i>

06:19.335 --> 06:21.293

an NDA in your inbox,

06:21.337 --> 06:24.993
and I would sign it

06:36.831 --> 06:38.093

this whole thing in my --

06:44.665 --> 06:46.449
Ohh!

06:46.493 --> 06:49.931
In God's name, tell me you were
gonna say "mouth," Sandra.

06:49.974 --> 06:53.108
- Ohh!

06:53.151 --> 06:55.502

Unfortunately, though, I got
to get this rug to the cleaners.

08:14.319 --> 08:15.669
I diarrhea'd on it.

08:15.712 --> 08:17.366
Fun!
Next time!

08:17.409 --> 08:19.586
You can do this.

08:19.629 --> 08:21.239
It's just physics.

Well, well, well.

08:28.595 --> 08:31.423
The day has come.

08:31.467 --> 08:32.903
Remember when I sent out
an all-staff

08:32.947 --> 08:34.688
saying anyone
could borrow my truck?

08:34.731 --> 08:37.560
Every single person replied.

08:37.604 --> 08:39.170
Except you.

08:39.214 --> 08:42.043
But I knew one day
you'd come a-beggin'.

08:42.086 --> 08:43.784
And you're right.
I was wrong to not reply

08:43.827 --> 08:46.264
to your completely
inappropriate all-staff.

08:46.308 --> 08:49.398
No, you were wrong to think
I would forgive you.

08:51.443 --> 08:52.836
Not so fast!

08:52.880 --> 08:55.796
Where my truck goes,
I go.

08:57.319 --> 09:00.670
Ow, ow, ow, ow!
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

I'd like to report
a stolen truck.

10:01.862 --> 10:04.821
He was but a wisp the last time
you saw him, eh, Charlie?

10:04.865 --> 10:07.345
She must be molting.

10:07.389 --> 10:10.697
We've got...elev--
twelve pieces of chicken,

10:10.740 --> 10:13.917
so everyone can have four.

10:13.961 --> 10:15.484
Four pieces of chicken.

10:15.527 --> 10:18.879
Stop trying to force
chicken down our throats.

10:18.922 --> 10:20.184
Nobody likes your rub!

10:20.228 --> 10:22.404
You don't like my rub!

10:22.447 --> 10:24.232
We'll order Thai.

10:24.275 --> 10:25.973
<i>Gillian...</i>

10:26.016 --> 10:27.801
- I've got this!
- No, I've got this!

10:27.844 --> 10:29.411
<i>5, 4, 3, 2...</i> I'm her assistant!

10:29.454 --> 10:30.847
I'm her attendant!

10:30.891 --> 10:33.197
They both gasp.

10:33.241 --> 10:37.506
A moment shared between
a woman and a man.

10:37.549 --> 10:39.029
We'll both do it.

10:39.073 --> 10:41.423
So you know,
I don't work well with others.

10:41.466 --> 10:44.905
There've been a few
HR complaints.

10:44.948 --> 10:46.297
Those your guncles?

10:46.341 --> 10:48.691
All will be
revealed in time.

10:48.735 --> 10:50.737
Mind the clypeal sheath!

10:50.780 --> 10:53.827
Welcome to the Cancel Cabin!

10:53.870 --> 10:56.307
This is bullshit!

10:56.351 --> 10:58.658
We prevented each of you
from being cancelled.

10:58.701 --> 11:00.485
You'll still be able
to Google yourself

11:00.529 --> 11:03.619
and go to a kids' talent show.
You're welcome.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.882
Dog With Bucket Hat: Some of you
will pump Sebben & Sebben stock,

11:05.926 --> 11:07.579
others will dump it.

11:07.623 --> 11:09.756
Paychecks can be cashed there.

11:09.799 --> 11:13.020
We will issue a debit card
connected to your paycheck.

11:13.063 --> 11:15.239
Your card can be used
at the company store

11:15.283 --> 11:17.894
where everything costs $14.

11:17.938 --> 11:21.811
Is it supposed to be this
c-c-cold in here?

11:21.855 --> 11:24.118
Those are $14.
Officer?

11:24.161 --> 11:29.514
Yes, yes it's supposed to be
this cold because this is work!

11:29.558 --> 11:32.604
My job is to make sure
things run smoothly.

11:32.648 --> 11:36.260
And her job is to tune
up troublemakers.

11:36.304 --> 11:40.308
Oh, my God, guys,
I am loving this persona!

11:40.351 --> 11:42.440
Whoa.

11:42.484 --> 11:45.269
An original 19th century
hatching room.

11:45.313 --> 11:47.141
They don't make 'em
like this anymore.

11:47.184 --> 11:49.273
I do a lot of reading
on birthing techniques.

11:49.317 --> 11:52.973
That's how I know
it's pronounced birthing.

11:53.016 --> 11:54.322
<i>Charlie: Whoa!</i>

11:54.365 --> 11:56.454
Well, looks like stage
one's complete,

11:56.498 --> 11:59.153
so if you don't need me anymore,
I'm gonna call it.

11:59.196 --> 12:01.459
This part of the process
could take days.

12:01.503 --> 12:04.854
I could use another steady
pair of hands and...

12:04.898 --> 12:06.769
sturdy calves.

12:06.813 --> 12:08.771
I do wide squats
three days a week.

12:08.815 --> 12:11.208
Please stay.
For her.

12:11.252 --> 12:13.123
For...me.

12:13.167 --> 12:14.951
Do you have
a points program?

12:14.995 --> 12:18.520
I'll have CJ make up the guest
room where we keep the dolls.

12:22.089 --> 12:24.569
What's that?

12:24.613 --> 12:27.050
That's...our
office building.

12:27.094 --> 12:29.400
Where's the rest of it?

12:29.444 --> 12:31.098
And what's that?

12:31.141 --> 12:33.970
That's Cade.
He works in receiving.

12:34.014 --> 12:35.842
Where's the rest of it?

12:36.886 --> 12:38.322
I'm being sexual.

12:38.366 --> 12:40.324
Mere, take a pic of me
in front of it.

12:40.368 --> 12:42.849
I've never seen a one-story
building!

12:46.113 --> 12:47.505
Guys, I've got something
to show you.

12:47.549 --> 12:48.898
His teste?

12:48.942 --> 12:51.683
What do you give the men
who have everything?

12:51.727 --> 12:54.382
Well, their very own
77-foot man bus!

13:00.040 --> 13:02.607
I got a hook-up in
the recreational vehicle space.

13:02.651 --> 13:05.132
That margarita machine
ain't foolin' around.

13:05.175 --> 13:06.481
How'd you pay for this?

13:06.524 --> 13:09.092
Easy.
He gave me an 18.5%

13:09.136 --> 13:11.529
96 month loan
which I collateralized

13:11.573 --> 13:13.836
against the stack
we're gonna make out there.

13:13.880 --> 13:16.491
It's all funny money,
right, bros?

13:16.534 --> 13:18.885
Fuck you,
the man-slash-Judy!

13:18.928 --> 13:21.191
That's our money, Paul. Wait...

13:21.235 --> 13:24.064
is that an entire wall
of Big Macs?

13:25.152 --> 13:28.764
You must be wondering
what my part is in all this.

13:28.808 --> 13:31.723
I was more wondering why there's
a goat on the table, but sure.

13:31.767 --> 13:33.856
I come from a centuries-old line
of attendants

13:33.900 --> 13:36.293
who've ushered Miss Charlie
through her rebirth.

13:36.337 --> 13:39.601
And when I'm gone,
CJ will take my place.

13:39.644 --> 13:44.258
If, and when, he stops
forcing chicken on people!

13:45.172 --> 13:46.869
You don't like my rub!

13:46.913 --> 13:50.394
Sure, I had other dreams,
but the enema bag,

13:50.438 --> 13:52.092
she's a stern mistress.

13:52.135 --> 13:54.442
Oh, Charles, I understand.

13:54.485 --> 13:58.663
Because, I, too, was born with
my destiny already forewritten.

13:58.707 --> 14:01.579
The Sans pinky.
Everyone in my family has it.

14:01.623 --> 14:05.061
It's a genetic gift that
makes us superior assistants.

14:05.105 --> 14:08.108
It allows me full keyboard
access with one hand.

14:08.151 --> 14:09.413
It's my gift.

14:09.457 --> 14:11.502
And my burden.

14:13.765 --> 14:17.900
♪ The winner takes it all

14:17.944 --> 14:22.122
♪ The loser's standing small

14:22.165 --> 14:24.864
♪ Beside the victory

14:24.907 --> 14:28.955
♪ That's her destiny

14:30.521 --> 14:33.655
Bam! A crisp $50
to today's top closer,

14:33.698 --> 14:36.919
and it ain't gonna be
Hugh the way he's fucking going!

14:36.963 --> 14:39.139
Given that we've only been here
45 minutes,

14:39.182 --> 14:42.446
I'm not sure it's fair
to judge me.

14:42.490 --> 14:45.275
Please, I beg you,
a little heat.

14:45.319 --> 14:47.843
I've lost feeling
below the waist.

14:47.887 --> 14:50.454
Aw, happy holidays.

14:52.979 --> 14:55.285
Thanks for supporting
my vision, fellas.

14:55.329 --> 14:58.071
This never would've happened
with Judy Ken Bottomline.

14:58.114 --> 15:00.812
Bottomline.
Classic.

15:00.856 --> 15:03.467
I tell ya, when I was four,
mother had one of her spells

15:03.511 --> 15:05.513
and took to her bed
for three years,

15:05.556 --> 15:07.558
making me the lady
of the house.

15:09.038 --> 15:10.910
Listen, maybe we -- us,

15:10.953 --> 15:13.303
are about more than
just ripping farts.

15:13.347 --> 15:16.306
When's the last time
you were vulnerable?

15:16.350 --> 15:18.918
What do you wish you said
to your Gran Gran

15:18.961 --> 15:21.311
before she passed?

15:25.011 --> 15:27.448
Nana?

15:27.491 --> 15:28.840
Please, no.
Please, no.

15:28.884 --> 15:31.017
I've got a family of pugs
at home.

15:31.060 --> 15:33.933
I brought stuff
for s'mores!

15:33.976 --> 15:36.500
Well, I forgot marshmallows
and chocolate.

15:36.544 --> 15:40.330
It's been lovely
having you here.

15:40.374 --> 15:43.029
We're used to rattling
around the manse by ourselves.

15:43.072 --> 15:46.119
Just out of curiosity,
where's CJ's mother?

15:46.162 --> 15:48.556
He doesn't have one.
I grew him in the hatching room.

15:48.599 --> 15:50.601
♪ The winner takes it all

15:50.645 --> 15:52.429
♪ Takes it all

15:52.473 --> 15:54.344
♪ The loser has to fall

15:54.388 --> 15:56.216

16:07.270 --> 16:08.880
You pushed it
too far, Paul.

16:08.924 --> 16:13.407
You broke the only rule --
you tried to make us feel.

16:13.450 --> 16:16.801
I started to feel something
and I never feel something!

16:16.845 --> 16:18.238
I'm so pissed at you, bro!

16:18.281 --> 16:20.022
Uh, what do we do with him?

16:20.066 --> 16:21.850
How about we just leave
his body in the woods

16:21.893 --> 16:23.983
and then wolves will come
and finish the work for us.

16:24.026 --> 16:25.854
I like the way
this is going.

16:25.897 --> 16:28.248
No body, no crime.

16:28.291 --> 16:30.250
I'd like to strenuously object
to the manner

16:30.293 --> 16:32.382
in which we have
been detained in this cabin.

16:32.426 --> 16:34.471
Let us handle this, Frenchie,

16:34.515 --> 16:37.518
we're going to get
our $14 worth.

16:43.219 --> 16:46.396
Because it's us, I'm gonna
assume there's no fire exit.

16:46.440 --> 16:49.747
Yep!
Now we'll be together forever.

16:51.314 --> 16:54.013
Oh, God.

16:54.056 --> 16:56.319
Gillian: If we ever shared
divine love,

16:56.363 --> 17:00.062
you must protect me
and my pinkie at all costs.

17:06.242 --> 17:07.548
Did you hear that?

17:07.591 --> 17:09.245
Probably a chicken.

17:09.289 --> 17:11.639
Ah, your lips.
What was that?

17:11.682 --> 17:13.423
Probably CJ
or a chicken.

17:13.467 --> 17:15.773
Just go back
to what you were doing.

17:18.820 --> 17:21.431
Oh, dear God,
what have we done?

17:21.475 --> 17:24.260
<i>Charlie: Get me the fuck</i> <i>
out of here!</i>

17:28.438 --> 17:31.441
You had one job and now
my Rejuvication is blown!

17:31.485 --> 17:35.097
And you released my skin sack
before we had a chance to fuse.

17:35.141 --> 17:37.447
By the way,
I could hear everything.

17:37.491 --> 17:41.060
Charles, you talk way
too much when you're fucking.

17:41.103 --> 17:42.931
And you're fired.

17:42.974 --> 17:44.367
But my blood oath!

17:44.411 --> 17:47.153
Like my father and his father
before him.

17:51.853 --> 17:53.463
That thing can drive?

17:53.507 --> 17:55.335
That thing is 10% of me,

17:55.378 --> 17:58.381
so it can do anything it
damn well sets its mind to.

17:59.861 --> 18:01.471
Put those in milk.

18:08.391 --> 18:09.827
You got Diane here.

18:09.871 --> 18:11.220
Judy?
Diane!

18:11.264 --> 18:13.396
Regular old line worker Diane.

18:13.440 --> 18:15.224
Hey, uh, we've run into
a little problem

18:15.268 --> 18:17.139
and I think you guys
might want to get back here.

18:17.183 --> 18:20.795
My name's also Diane
but with a hard E.

18:20.838 --> 18:23.667
Dian-ee.

18:23.711 --> 18:27.149
Gillian.
Gillianianiana.

18:27.193 --> 18:30.370
You have got to get
your flat ass out here.

18:30.413 --> 18:33.634
So, Charlie has this little
thing she does every 19 --

18:33.677 --> 18:36.289
The Rejuvication!
What year is this?!

18:36.332 --> 18:37.855
1991!

18:37.899 --> 18:39.466
Since you're clearly
up to speed --

18:39.509 --> 18:40.815
the skin sack's escaped.

18:40.858 --> 18:43.644
Oh. My. God.

18:43.687 --> 18:45.167
Birdsteam?

18:45.211 --> 18:47.256
No.
Go!

18:54.916 --> 18:57.527
Oh, God.

18:57.571 --> 19:00.400
I didn't know how much
I needed fellowship,

19:00.443 --> 19:03.011
but now I can't
live without it.

19:03.054 --> 19:05.796
You'll never be one of us,
but you're all right.

19:05.840 --> 19:07.233
He's not all right!

19:07.276 --> 19:09.409
He swallowed the keys,
and we're all gonna die!

19:09.452 --> 19:11.498
What's this?
A secret exit.

19:11.541 --> 19:13.369
This wasn't
worth mentioning?!

19:13.413 --> 19:15.545
Then it wouldn't be secret,
would it, Marty?

19:15.589 --> 19:18.461
It's Hugh, Brian.
I was your best man.

19:20.550 --> 19:22.161
Charlie: Stop!

19:24.641 --> 19:25.990
It's close.

19:26.034 --> 19:27.427
She can sense it.

19:27.470 --> 19:29.603
No, Gillian, I have a nose.

19:29.646 --> 19:31.779
It smells like pork rinds
and gooch.

19:33.084 --> 19:35.652
- Scarlie?
- Aah!

19:35.696 --> 19:38.307
- Scarlie, no!
- Help me!

19:38.351 --> 19:40.179
- No!
- It's too late.

19:40.222 --> 19:41.615
- Bad Scarlie.
- He's gone.

19:41.658 --> 19:43.573
- Help me!
- Scarlie!

19:43.617 --> 19:45.532
Nothing to do now
but watch.

19:45.575 --> 19:48.622
There are so many things
besides watch that you could do!

19:48.665 --> 19:50.058
He's with
the chickens now.

19:50.101 --> 19:51.364
Charlie:
A little help?

19:51.407 --> 19:53.409
Any kind of disinfectant!

19:58.109 --> 20:00.242
Paul: Two-day road trip
with the bros!

20:00.286 --> 20:01.809
I'll get my clothes back on.

20:01.852 --> 20:03.680
Meredith: Hey, kid,
make yourself useful

20:03.724 --> 20:05.378
and give me a piggyback.

20:05.421 --> 20:09.425
Charlie: Scarlie, don't run!

20:09.469 --> 20:11.775
Scarlie.

20:11.819 --> 20:13.560
We're not going to hurt you.

20:15.953 --> 20:19.000
Come here, pretty girl.

20:19.043 --> 20:21.176
Yeah, Mamma's got you.

20:21.220 --> 20:22.873
Come on.
Come on.

20:25.920 --> 20:27.574
There you go.

20:31.099 --> 20:32.622
Birdcat, bad!

20:35.799 --> 20:38.149
Two Charlies,
can't tell who's who.

20:38.193 --> 20:40.151
Are you fucking
kidding me?

20:40.195 --> 20:41.936
You're such
a lightweight.

20:41.979 --> 20:43.851
That's obviously Charlie.

20:43.894 --> 20:45.679
Take the shot!

20:51.598 --> 20:53.774
- I've got this!
- No, I've got this.

20:53.817 --> 20:56.080
I'm her attendant!

21:08.005 --> 21:10.878
Charles!
My love!

21:12.532 --> 21:14.621
I always have so much anxiety
with driving,

21:14.664 --> 21:17.101
but this is like driving
with mama.

21:17.145 --> 21:19.060
Aah!

21:19.103 --> 21:21.584
I can't believe I'm going to
have to wait another

21:21.628 --> 21:23.673
19 years to rebirth.

21:23.717 --> 21:26.415
Looks like someone
needs a piggyback.

21:26.459 --> 21:28.678
- Moment's passed, Cade.
- Bye.

21:28.722 --> 21:30.637
Gillian! Ohh!

21:30.680 --> 21:32.421
Where is she?

21:32.465 --> 21:35.337
A gift.
For your pretzel hands.

21:35.381 --> 21:36.686
So people won't stare.

21:36.730 --> 21:38.122
Stay with me.

21:38.166 --> 21:40.734
Think of what we could do
in 19 years.

21:40.777 --> 21:42.562
No.
I shan't.

21:42.605 --> 21:45.347
We've both sworn fealty
to a higher power.

21:45.391 --> 21:48.263
Plus, you'll be like 80?

21:48.307 --> 21:49.830
Gillian!

21:49.873 --> 21:51.745
It's life calling.

21:51.788 --> 21:54.965
I'll see you in 19 years.

21:55.009 --> 21:56.227
Yes.

21:56.271 --> 21:57.925
Unless, like, I'm married,

21:57.968 --> 22:01.494
then it probably
wouldn't be appropriate.
