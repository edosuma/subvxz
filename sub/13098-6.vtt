00:01.500 --> 00:03.917
[dramatic music]

00:06.333 --> 00:08.750
(male #1)
'This is Earth Alliance
Squadron Black Omega'

00:08.833 --> 00:10.750
to stolen transport.

00:10.833 --> 00:12.333
You're ordered
to surrender your vessel

00:12.417 --> 00:13.875
and prepare to be boarded.

00:13.958 --> 00:17.083
'If you attempt escape you will
be fired upon and destroyed.'

00:19.417 --> 00:21.125
'Do you understand?'

00:23.917 --> 00:25.833
'Repeat, surrender or..'

00:25.917 --> 00:27.792
[buzzing]

00:30.708 --> 00:32.667
[explosion]

00:37.292 --> 00:39.042
(Catherine)
'There's a problem, commander.'

00:39.958 --> 00:41.208
You missed a button.

00:41.292 --> 00:43.333
You're bright
and cheerful this morning.

00:43.417 --> 00:45.375
Got an offer on the table
from Universal Terraform

00:45.458 --> 00:48.792
to do some surveying I'm seeing
them in an hour to talk terms.

00:48.875 --> 00:51.167
That's a big operation,
sure you want to get involved

00:51.250 --> 00:52.625
with a mega corp?

00:52.708 --> 00:55.208
Jeff, I've been around
the block a few times

00:55.292 --> 00:56.750
I can handle myself.

00:56.833 --> 00:58.708
- You worry too much.
- You don't worry enough.

00:58.792 --> 01:01.292
- Perfect combination.
- Mmh.

01:01.375 --> 01:03.958
Gotta hurry.
See you at lunch?

01:04.042 --> 01:05.792
Can't. I have a budget meeting

01:05.875 --> 01:08.000
with the construction guild.
Have to make some cuts.

01:08.083 --> 01:09.542
Can't say
I'm not looking forward to it.

01:09.625 --> 01:11.167
I'm sure, It'll be fine.

01:11.250 --> 01:12.750
It's been quiet
for the last week

01:12.833 --> 01:14.625
the whole place is on schedule.

01:14.708 --> 01:16.375
What could go wrong?

01:21.083 --> 01:22.625
(female #1)
'Confirm, Seven Tango Seven'

01:22.708 --> 01:24.083
'you're clear to dock.'

01:25.417 --> 01:27.583
Affirmative, Babylon Control.

01:29.458 --> 01:31.792
I'm looking forward to my visit.

01:31.875 --> 01:33.250
[intense music]

01:35.417 --> 01:39.250
(male narrator)
It was the dawn
of the Third Age of mankind

01:39.333 --> 01:42.125
ten years after
the Earth-Minbari War.

01:42.208 --> 01:46.042
The Babylon Project
was a dream given form.

01:46.125 --> 01:48.000
Its goal,
to prevent another war

01:48.083 --> 01:50.583
by creating a place
where humans and aliens

01:50.667 --> 01:53.167
could work out their
differences peacefully.

01:53.250 --> 01:55.917
It's a port of call,
home away from home

01:56.000 --> 02:01.125
for diplomats, hustlers,
entrepreneurs and wanderers.

02:01.208 --> 02:05.667
Humans and aliens,
wrapped in 2,500,000 tons

02:05.750 --> 02:09.625
of spinning metal,
all alone in the night.

02:11.167 --> 02:13.292
It can be a dangerous place.

02:13.375 --> 02:16.458
But it's our last,
best hope for peace.

02:16.542 --> 02:20.417
This is the story of the last
of the Babylon stations.

02:20.500 --> 02:22.750
The year is 2258.

02:22.833 --> 02:26.292
The name of the place
is Babylon 5.

02:26.375 --> 02:28.417
[theme music]

03:05.333 --> 03:07.417
[instrumental music]

03:09.500 --> 03:12.583
I've often wondered what
it's like to be a telepath.

03:12.667 --> 03:14.917
It's like staying
in a hotel room

03:15.000 --> 03:17.833
where you can just hear
the people talking next door.

03:17.917 --> 03:20.917
You can try and shut it out,
but it's always there.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.625
The key is to not to listen
unless unless you're invited.

03:23.708 --> 03:27.083
So is it difficult to block out
people's thoughts?

03:27.167 --> 03:29.042
Depends on the thoughts.

03:30.542 --> 03:33.542
- 'Destination? '
- Blue 14.

03:35.208 --> 03:37.208
Casual thoughts
are very easy to block

03:37.292 --> 03:40.292
but strong emotions have a way
of slipping through sometimes.

03:40.375 --> 03:42.958
whether you want them
to or not.

03:43.042 --> 03:45.583
[instrumental music]

03:48.083 --> 03:49.375
[thuds]

03:49.458 --> 03:51.583
[automated]
'Blue 14.'

03:57.625 --> 04:00.708
[groans]
Oh, I think I'm in love.

04:02.542 --> 04:07.500
[automated]
'Earth transport Spinoza is now
embarking in Dock Area 9.'

04:12.000 --> 04:13.500
Yes?

04:19.125 --> 04:22.250
No, sir. I just never met
a Psi Cop before.

04:23.875 --> 04:25.875
Yes, sir.
I'll bring you there myself.

04:27.083 --> 04:28.625
This way.

04:32.208 --> 04:34.667
Would you tell me more
about the target?

04:34.750 --> 04:37.833
It's a class-four world,
designated Sigma 957.

04:37.917 --> 04:41.000
Not much atmosphere,
mostly nitrogen and oxygen.

04:41.083 --> 04:43.792
And their fly-by sensor picked
up traces of diridium.

04:43.875 --> 04:46.000
Byproduct of Quantium-40.

04:46.083 --> 04:48.000
Usually, we need that verified.

04:48.083 --> 04:50.250
If so, we'll send out a live
scientist probe, make sure

04:50.333 --> 04:51.417
we're in accord
with all the regs in

04:51.500 --> 04:53.083
planetary exploitation.

04:53.167 --> 04:57.208
But we can't afford that unless
we're it's worth the effort.

04:57.292 --> 04:59.042
How can it not be worth it?

04:59.125 --> 05:01.125
There's a shortage
of Q-40 on Earth.

05:01.208 --> 05:03.417
They're backed up six months
on jump-gate construction.

05:03.500 --> 05:05.792
Which is why we need absolute
confidentiality.

05:05.875 --> 05:08.708
I need your word that you won't
mention this to anyone

05:08.792 --> 05:10.375
including the commander.

05:11.792 --> 05:13.208
My personal life has
nothing to do--

05:13.292 --> 05:17.167
I know. I know, I was told
to ask, so I'm asking.

05:17.250 --> 05:20.333
We each have our marching
orders, Ms. Sakai.

05:21.708 --> 05:23.167
'So do I have your word?'

05:26.417 --> 05:29.500
- She's telling the truth.
- Well, then, we have a deal.

05:31.875 --> 05:35.417
There is one other thing,
the target is in a..

05:35.500 --> 05:37.750
...contested sector of space.

05:37.833 --> 05:39.458
So we'll need the approval
of one other party

05:39.542 --> 05:42.083
'before we can proceed
with the survey.'

05:42.167 --> 05:44.750
[instrumental music]

05:51.083 --> 05:54.417
Commander? Some VIPs
here to see you, sir.

05:55.833 --> 05:57.458
Send them in.

06:02.417 --> 06:04.708
No, it's a fine time, I..

06:09.333 --> 06:12.583
Get out of my head.

06:12.667 --> 06:14.917
You wanna talk to me,
talk to me.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.583
My apologies, commander.

06:17.667 --> 06:20.542
- It saves considerable time.
- I don't care.

06:20.625 --> 06:22.292
I don't like people
rummaging around in my head.

06:22.375 --> 06:24.958
I thought the Psi Corps had
rules about this sort of thing.

06:25.042 --> 06:27.542
There are rules,
and there are rules, commander.

06:27.625 --> 06:31.125
When telepaths go rogue,
someone has to take them down.

06:31.208 --> 06:33.917
Only Psi Cops are qualified
to do that.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.167
Since we bear a greater
responsibility

06:36.250 --> 06:39.875
we're afforded latitude
in the interest of efficiency.

06:39.958 --> 06:43.917
- Yes, I'm sure, Mr--
- Bester.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.375
This is my associate,
Ms. Kelsey.

06:46.458 --> 06:48.625
We're looking
for a rogue telepath.

06:48.708 --> 06:50.792
We have reason to believe
he maybe on this station.

06:50.875 --> 06:52.958
We need to set up a meeting
as soon as possible

06:53.042 --> 06:56.125
with your resident telepath
as well as your security

06:56.208 --> 06:58.333
and command personnel,
then we'll proceed--

06:58.417 --> 07:00.250
I am not turning
this station upside down

07:00.333 --> 07:03.000
because you're hunting down
one rogue telepath.

07:03.083 --> 07:06.167
Not just a rogue, commander.

07:06.250 --> 07:09.458
This is a special
and very dangerous individual

07:09.542 --> 07:12.458
whose presence here threatens
the entire Earth Alliance

07:12.542 --> 07:14.542
military structure.

07:16.375 --> 07:18.042
This is our basic
guest quarters.

07:18.125 --> 07:20.875
The vibe shower's in the back
and through that door--

07:20.958 --> 07:23.208
- Price?
- 500 credits per week.

07:23.292 --> 07:25.958
Based on Earth standard
rotational cycles.

07:26.042 --> 07:27.583
Fine. Fine.

07:27.667 --> 07:29.000
If there's anything
else you need--

07:29.083 --> 07:30.958
No. No, thank you.

07:31.042 --> 07:33.583
[intense music]

07:42.958 --> 07:47.250

'Welcome to Babylon 5.
We are at your disposal'

of onboard facilities

07:50.125 --> 07:51.708

07:51.792 --> 07:54.292

07:54.375 --> 07:57.667

07:57.750 --> 08:00.792
[electric humming]

08:07.667 --> 08:10.708
[rumbling]

08:22.625 --> 08:25.250
(Bester)
His name is Jason Ironheart.

08:25.333 --> 08:27.125
I believe you know him,
Miss Winters.

08:27.208 --> 08:30.083
Yes, he was my instructor at
the Psi Corps training Academy.

08:30.167 --> 08:31.792
His job is to work
with telepaths

08:31.875 --> 08:33.333
'level P-5 through P-10'

08:33.417 --> 08:36.375
high level training, jamming
long-range scanning

08:36.458 --> 08:38.500
the development of fringe
skills, that sort of thing.

08:38.583 --> 08:40.500
- What's his Psi rating?
- He's a ten.

08:40.583 --> 08:43.250
All instructors
at the academy are rated P-10.

08:43.333 --> 08:45.833
And Psi Cops?
What are you rated?

08:45.917 --> 08:47.083
P-12.

08:47.167 --> 08:49.458
Someone has to keep an eye
on the rest.

08:49.542 --> 08:52.208
Yes, but who watches
the watchmen?

08:52.292 --> 08:55.458
One year ago, Jason Ironheart
was reassigned

08:55.542 --> 08:57.667
to Earth Force
military Intelligence

08:58.667 --> 09:00.083
working on a covert operation.

09:00.167 --> 09:01.833
What kind of covert operation?

09:01.917 --> 09:05.250
That information is on a
need-to-know basis, commander.

09:05.333 --> 09:07.042
And you don't need to know.

09:07.125 --> 09:08.708
Let's just say that
what's in his brain

09:08.792 --> 09:11.458
would compromise
Earth Force defense

09:11.542 --> 09:14.458
and lead to the death of many
of our covert operatives

09:14.542 --> 09:15.792
on other worlds.

09:15.875 --> 09:17.458
We think he intends to sell

09:17.542 --> 09:19.250
that information
to other governments.

09:19.333 --> 09:22.583
That's nonsense! Jason would
never do anything like that.

09:22.667 --> 09:26.708
Our job is to find him and bring
him back. Alive if possible.

09:26.792 --> 09:28.625
Dead if necessary.

09:28.708 --> 09:30.958
Have you had any contact
with Jason Ironheart

09:31.042 --> 09:32.625
since you left the academy?

09:32.708 --> 09:35.333
Just letters, the last one
was about a year ago.

09:35.417 --> 09:39.375
You understand we'll have
to scan you to be sure.

09:39.458 --> 09:43.167
Is that necessary?
I'm telling you the truth.

09:43.250 --> 09:45.542
Perhaps. Perhaps not.

09:45.625 --> 09:48.167
Look, if she doesn't want
to be scanned--

09:48.250 --> 09:50.583
She's required to submit.

09:50.667 --> 09:53.250
If she's seen him
or heard from him

09:53.333 --> 09:56.125
'his mental fingerprints will be
in her thoughts.'

09:56.208 --> 09:58.958
(Kelsey)
The process is not pleasant.

09:59.042 --> 10:01.875
You may stay
or leave as you choose.

10:01.958 --> 10:05.000
[intense music]

10:24.292 --> 10:26.500
[groaning]

10:39.292 --> 10:40.708
That's enough.

10:42.958 --> 10:44.292
I said that's enough!

10:44.375 --> 10:47.083
[groaning]

10:51.417 --> 10:54.333
She's telling the truth.
She hasn't seen him.

10:54.417 --> 10:56.917
(Kelsey)
'Surprising, given
your prior involvement.'

10:58.958 --> 11:02.000
If Ironheart hasn't shown up
yet, he will.

11:02.083 --> 11:03.792
We must be informed at once.

11:03.875 --> 11:06.667
Do not attempt
any contact with him.

11:06.750 --> 11:09.417
Especially you, Miss Winters.

11:09.500 --> 11:13.000
Do not approach him.
Do not speak to him.

11:13.750 --> 11:15.125
Is that clear?

11:16.167 --> 11:17.458
Yes.

11:19.167 --> 11:20.833
You can go now.

11:25.333 --> 11:27.792
What level of physical threat
does he represent?

11:27.875 --> 11:30.917
That's something else
you don't need to know.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.125
Just find him.
We'll do the rest.

11:34.208 --> 11:36.125
[intense music]

11:47.208 --> 11:51.167
Hello, Talia.
I've been looking for you.

11:55.792 --> 11:57.833
[intense music]

11:57.917 --> 12:00.333
Talia. Talia, wait, please!

12:02.167 --> 12:04.292
I can't see you.
The Psi Cops are here.

12:04.375 --> 12:06.750
I know. Listen, Talia..

12:06.833 --> 12:09.375
What did you do?
Why are they after you?

12:09.458 --> 12:10.917
Do you know what they did to me?

12:11.000 --> 12:12.583
Yes. Yes, I do.

12:12.667 --> 12:14.708
That's why I waited until
after they scanned you

12:14.792 --> 12:16.458
to make contact.

12:16.542 --> 12:19.833
But it's okay. We'll be safe
for a while, at least.

12:21.042 --> 12:24.667
I have to talk to you.
I-I need a place.

12:24.750 --> 12:28.208
A place where I can wait,
just for a little while.

12:28.292 --> 12:30.625
Why? What's going on, Jason?

12:30.708 --> 12:35.000
All I can say now is that
I can't let them find me.

12:35.083 --> 12:36.708
If they do,
then I'll have to kill them

12:36.792 --> 12:38.875
or they'll have to kill me.

12:38.958 --> 12:40.875
But it's not just us, Talia.

12:40.958 --> 12:44.333
There are thousands,
millions of lives are at stake.

12:44.417 --> 12:47.500
Just give me five minutes
to explain, that's all.

12:47.583 --> 12:50.708
Then, if you want me to leave,
I will.

12:52.625 --> 12:53.833
Please.

12:55.417 --> 12:58.000
If this is your way getting
at the commander through me--

12:58.083 --> 12:59.833
No, whether you believe it
or not

12:59.917 --> 13:02.042
I'm doing this
for your own safety.

13:02.125 --> 13:05.542
Sigma 957
is not a healthy place.

13:05.625 --> 13:07.500
Strange things happen there.

13:07.583 --> 13:09.292
It's uninhabited.

13:09.375 --> 13:11.333
There's no sentient life
to threaten anyone.

13:11.417 --> 13:12.833
Nonetheless, it is not safe.

13:12.917 --> 13:14.625
I have passed
through that sector.

13:14.708 --> 13:16.708
Take my word. Look elsewhere.

13:16.792 --> 13:19.708
I think you want Sigma 957
for yourself.

13:19.792 --> 13:21.750
The Narn government
doesn't have the resources

13:21.833 --> 13:23.750
to exploit a world
that far away.

13:23.833 --> 13:27.417
But you wanna hold on to it
anyway out of sheer spite.

13:27.500 --> 13:30.167
Considering what you were
probably told about me

13:30.250 --> 13:32.792
I'm sure
you do believe that.

13:32.875 --> 13:34.750
Despite your long acquaintance
with Sinclair

13:34.833 --> 13:36.792
you're new here, aren't you?

13:36.875 --> 13:38.875
Let me pass on
to you the one thing

13:38.958 --> 13:41.125
I've learned about this place.

13:43.042 --> 13:48.125
No one here is exactly
what he appears.

13:48.208 --> 13:51.583
Not Mollari, not Delenn..

13:51.667 --> 13:55.625
...not Sinclair and not me.

13:55.708 --> 14:00.292
My warning is sincere.
Ignore it at your own peril.

14:01.833 --> 14:03.458
Ambassador.

14:04.667 --> 14:06.292
If I have to,
I'll go over your head.

14:06.375 --> 14:09.000
I have contacts of my own
in the Narn Regime.

14:09.083 --> 14:11.875
Then I fear the commander
will miss you greatly

14:11.958 --> 14:15.458
when you fail to return
from Sigma 957.

14:18.958 --> 14:24.000
A year ago, I volunteered
for a Psi Corps experiment.

14:24.083 --> 14:28.000
It was an attempt to make
telepaths even stronger.

14:28.083 --> 14:31.875
Turn a P-5 into a P-10,
and a P-10 into..

14:32.667 --> 14:34.875
Into God knows what.

14:34.958 --> 14:36.167
Why?

14:36.250 --> 14:38.500
Because in this business,
whoever has

14:38.583 --> 14:41.833
the strongest telepath wins.

14:41.917 --> 14:44.292
The military wants
to scan the enemy.

14:44.375 --> 14:47.333
The enemy wants a telepath
strong enough to block the scan.

14:47.417 --> 14:50.292
And we want someone
who can cut through the block.

14:52.042 --> 14:54.875
They said it was necessary
to help protect Earth.

14:56.333 --> 15:00.083
Anyway, the experiments
went on for months.

15:00.167 --> 15:03.417
Genetic manipulation,
mutated strains of serotonin

15:03.500 --> 15:06.292
and acetylcholine to increase
neural processing.

15:06.375 --> 15:10.583
Five, ten, sometimes fifteen
injections a day. The pain was..

15:14.292 --> 15:16.833
Then one day, I woke up..

15:18.208 --> 15:21.125
...and I could see everything.

15:21.208 --> 15:25.083
It was as if my mind had been
a seed for all of those years

15:25.167 --> 15:27.917
and then suddenly it blossomed.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.667
I could cut through any block
without even trying.

15:30.750 --> 15:32.667
All I had to do was
to look at them

15:32.750 --> 15:34.500
to see what was inside.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.250
And that's when
I discovered the truth.

15:40.583 --> 15:43.208
Talia, do you remember
the T-K tests

15:43.292 --> 15:46.167
that you took just before
you graduated from the academy?

15:46.250 --> 15:49.500
Of course, I used an old penny
I've had since I was a girl.

15:49.583 --> 15:52.208
I tried it for days to make it
move with my thoughts.

15:52.292 --> 15:53.917
And I couldn't do it.

15:54.000 --> 15:57.958
Only one in every 1000 humans
has telepathic abilities.

15:58.042 --> 16:00.375
Only one in every
10,000 telepaths

16:00.458 --> 16:02.042
has telekinetic abilities

16:02.125 --> 16:04.292
and half of them
are clinically insane.

16:05.625 --> 16:08.625
You see that was the real
purpose behind the experiment.

16:08.708 --> 16:13.792
To create a stable telekinetic.
And it worked, Talia.

16:13.875 --> 16:16.875
It worked beyond everyone's
wildest dreams.

16:18.375 --> 16:20.792
That is why I cannot go back.

16:22.583 --> 16:24.958
Even if it means letting them
kill me.

16:30.708 --> 16:33.292
Commander, I just
got a lead on Ironheart.

16:33.375 --> 16:35.167
We ran a check on the incoming
ships and it turns out

16:35.250 --> 16:36.667
one of them
was a stolen transport.

16:36.750 --> 16:38.458
- Where's it from?
- Sector 15.

16:38.542 --> 16:40.375
That puts it two jumps
away from the station.

16:40.458 --> 16:42.000
I checked with Bester,
that match is the last known

16:42.083 --> 16:43.542
location for Ironheart.

16:43.625 --> 16:45.917
Assuming he hasn't booked
passage on another transport

16:46.000 --> 16:47.417
he'll need a place to stay.

16:47.500 --> 16:49.292
I'm already on it,
50 guest quarters were rented

16:49.375 --> 16:51.750
in the last 24 hours,
I'm having everyone checked.

16:51.833 --> 16:54.917
I want that guy found and out
of here as fast as possible.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.167
I don't like Psi Cops nosing
around up here.

16:57.250 --> 16:58.833
There's just something creepy
about them.

16:58.917 --> 17:01.208
The way they look at you
like you're some kind of bug.

17:05.208 --> 17:07.208
Commander.

17:07.292 --> 17:11.542
Just 50 quarters to search.
Good.

17:11.625 --> 17:13.333
That should help narrow it down.

17:16.667 --> 17:19.375
Anatomically impossible,
Mr. Garibaldi

17:20.500 --> 17:24.208
but you're welcome to try.
Anytime.

17:25.542 --> 17:27.333

requesting

18:06.833 --> 18:09.625
clear channel to Narn Military
Headquarters.

18:11.083 --> 18:15.042
I require a Frazi-class
heavy fighter for a mission.

18:15.125 --> 18:17.750
Destination Sigma 957.

18:19.750 --> 18:22.500
Make sure it's well-armed.

18:25.583 --> 18:29.083
I thought they wanted
telekinetics for big jobs.

18:29.167 --> 18:31.833
Heavy construction
and zero gravity or defense.

18:31.917 --> 18:35.000
I mean, imagine, a telekinetic
shield as a defense

18:35.083 --> 18:38.833
against beam weapons,
for-for diplomats or presidents.

18:38.917 --> 18:40.792
But they didn't want big.

18:40.875 --> 18:44.333
No, they wanted mental control
over small objects

18:44.417 --> 18:45.833
the smaller the better.

18:45.917 --> 18:47.375
Jason, that doesn't
make any sense.

18:47.458 --> 18:49.000
No? Think about it.

18:49.083 --> 18:53.125
You want to assassinate someone,
so you bring in a telekinetic.

18:53.208 --> 18:56.375
He reaches into the person's
throat, and then gently

18:56.458 --> 18:58.583
quietly, with a thought..

18:58.667 --> 19:01.792
...he pinches
the carotid artery shut.

19:01.875 --> 19:05.000
The blood stops,
the brain starves..

19:05.083 --> 19:09.542
...the target dies
and then you just let go.

19:09.625 --> 19:13.583
Murder without a trace.
No fingerprints, no poisons.

19:13.667 --> 19:15.000
Oh, my God.

19:15.083 --> 19:17.875
But they didn't understand,
Talia.

19:17.958 --> 19:21.417
- The power, how far it..
- Jason.

19:21.500 --> 19:24.875
- What is it?
- Get out. Please, quickly.

19:24.958 --> 19:27.208
I-I can't control this.

19:27.292 --> 19:29.375

19:31.292 --> 19:35.625
Get out!
While you can..

19:56.167 --> 19:57.333

19:58.750 --> 20:00.417
Have you got a fix on the source
of that disturbance?

20:00.500 --> 20:03.167
Yeah, level 16, about three
sections further down.

20:03.250 --> 20:06.250
Just one problem. Only way there
is to go through that.

20:07.042 --> 20:08.792
[buzzing]

20:08.875 --> 20:10.292
- What is it?
- I don't know.

20:10.375 --> 20:12.125
But it has got level 16
completely surrounded.

20:12.208 --> 20:15.167
360 degrees.
We can't get past it.

20:15.250 --> 20:17.292
When we asked Bester what level
of physical threat this guy

20:17.375 --> 20:19.958
represents he said he was
on a need-to-know basis.

20:20.042 --> 20:22.500
You asked me right now,
we need to know.

21:05.292 --> 21:06.708
We had our orders.

21:06.792 --> 21:09.208
Bester, I don't care if you had
a personal message from God

21:09.292 --> 21:10.542
complete with stone tablets.

21:10.625 --> 21:12.667
You lied to me,
you withheld information

21:12.750 --> 21:14.083
and put this station at risk.

21:14.167 --> 21:16.000
Call me crazy, but don't you
think it might have helped

21:16.083 --> 21:17.667
for us to know
what we're facing?

21:17.750 --> 21:19.583
We were doing
what we thought was best.

21:19.667 --> 21:21.542
You were wrong
and because of that I've got

21:21.625 --> 21:23.833
a half-dozen wounded men
on a section of Blue 16

21:23.917 --> 21:25.667
that's turned into
a no mans land.

21:25.750 --> 21:27.792
Every corridor and transport
tube in to there

21:27.875 --> 21:29.625
is blocked
by some kind of curtain.

21:29.708 --> 21:32.250
Now I want the truth,
and I want it now.

21:32.333 --> 21:37.458
Mr. Ironheart is no longer
what you or I would consider..

21:38.625 --> 21:40.208
...entirely human.

21:40.292 --> 21:41.958
Then what is he?

21:43.417 --> 21:44.708
We don't know.

21:48.625 --> 21:51.292
[electric crackling]

22:09.917 --> 22:11.583
After the last phase
of the experiment

22:11.667 --> 22:14.125
Ironheart began
showing signs of stress

22:14.208 --> 22:16.542
paranoia, psychosis.

22:16.625 --> 22:19.083
One night,
he slipped out of his room

22:19.167 --> 22:22.083
killed the head researcher,
and escaped.

22:22.167 --> 22:24.708
At each step of the way,
his telekinetic abilities

22:24.792 --> 22:27.500
have grown stronger,
more violent.

22:27.583 --> 22:30.542
In his enhanced state,
he's valuable commodity.

22:30.625 --> 22:32.000
If word got out
other governments

22:32.083 --> 22:33.583
might try to grab him first.

22:33.667 --> 22:37.625
We couldn't take that chance.
It was a calculated risk.

22:37.708 --> 22:41.042
Good old Psi Corps. You guys
never cease to amaze me.

22:45.750 --> 22:47.583
Oops, there goes another
calculated risk.

22:47.667 --> 22:49.625
You're not helping
the situation.

(Jeff)
'We've seen how powerful he is.'

22:53.708 --> 22:56.083
How did just the you two of you
plan to stop him?

22:56.167 --> 22:58.417
During the experiment
Ironheart was programmed

22:58.500 --> 23:02.333
with a fail-safe code that will
shut him down, put him to sleep.

23:02.417 --> 23:06.333
It has to be sent by a telepath
directly into his brain.

23:06.417 --> 23:07.875
He's got to have defenses.

23:07.958 --> 23:09.833
Between the two of us,
we are strong enough

23:09.917 --> 23:13.125
to burrow past his defenses
and take him down.

23:13.208 --> 23:15.250
But we have to be
in the line of sight to do it.

23:16.042 --> 23:17.792
You have two choices.

23:17.875 --> 23:21.292
'Let us take him down our way,
or you'll have to kill him'

23:21.375 --> 23:24.375

would be enough.

24:48.458 --> 24:52.542

I need to talk to you.

26:48.333 --> 26:51.500
- I've seen Jason.
- What? Where?

26:51.583 --> 26:53.458
It's a long story
and we don't have much time.

26:53.542 --> 26:56.042
We need to talk privately
and quickly.

27:03.042 --> 27:06.125
Jason's changing,
his telekinetic abilities

27:06.208 --> 27:08.958
are growing faster
than he anticipated.

27:09.042 --> 27:10.875
It's almost beyond his control.

27:10.958 --> 27:12.542
He doesn't want to
endanger the station.

27:12.625 --> 27:14.042
And doesn't wanna hurt anyone.

27:14.125 --> 27:17.042
But what he's becoming
doesn't leave him much choice.

27:17.125 --> 27:20.042
He wants to see you,
alone and unarmed.

27:20.125 --> 27:22.292
He'll drop his defenses
but only for you.

27:22.375 --> 27:25.000
I know it's asking you
to take a terrible chance

27:25.083 --> 27:27.333
but it's only one we've got.

27:27.417 --> 27:29.875
Alright. Where and when?

27:29.958 --> 27:31.375
Blue 12 in one hour.

27:31.458 --> 27:34.208
Talia, what's between you
and Jason?

27:34.292 --> 27:37.708
- Why did he come here?
- To see me.

27:39.417 --> 27:40.792
We were lovers.

27:42.125 --> 27:44.542
He was everything to me.

27:44.625 --> 27:49.333
The perfect model of what it
meant to be in the Corps.

27:49.417 --> 27:53.167
Do you know what it's like when
telepaths make love, commander?

27:54.750 --> 27:59.500
You drop every defense
and it's all mirrors..

27:59.583 --> 28:01.708
...reflecting
each other's feelings

28:02.667 --> 28:05.583
deeper and deeper..

28:05.667 --> 28:08.208
...until,
somewhere along the line..

28:08.292 --> 28:12.292
...your souls mix.

28:14.208 --> 28:17.292
And it's a feeling so profound

28:17.375 --> 28:19.625
it makes you hurt.

28:24.375 --> 28:26.625
It's the only moment
in a telepath's life

28:26.708 --> 28:29.083
when you no longer
hear the voices.

28:32.333 --> 28:34.708
He came to say goodbye,
commander.

28:36.667 --> 28:38.583
He came to say goodbye.

28:41.417 --> 28:43.958
[dramatic music]

28:45.917 --> 28:47.875
[zapping]

29:10.500 --> 29:14.167
Computer, identify.
What the hell was that?

29:14.250 --> 29:16.417
(computer)
'Unknown.'

29:16.500 --> 29:19.333
- Computer..
- 'Ninety percent power loss'.

29:19.417 --> 29:23.625
- Emergency power.
- 'Negative emergency power.'

29:23.708 --> 29:25.917
'Orbit deteriorating.'

29:26.000 --> 29:30.083
'Estimate impact with Sigma 957'

29:30.167 --> 29:31.875
'in two hours.'

29:31.958 --> 29:33.917
[beeping]

29:35.333 --> 29:37.583
[dramatic music]

29:46.125 --> 29:48.458
(Catherine)
'Computer, open emergency
tachyon channel to Babylon 5.'

29:48.542 --> 29:53.167
(computer)
'Insufficient energy reserves
to establish communications.'

29:53.250 --> 29:57.708
- Scan for any nearby ships.
- 'Negative on scan.'

29:57.792 --> 29:59.708
Adjust ship's orientation.

29:59.792 --> 30:01.167
Maybe we can bounce off
the atmosphere

30:01.250 --> 30:02.875
instead of burning up
when we hit.

30:02.958 --> 30:05.792
(computer)
'Negative. Insufficient power.'

30:05.875 --> 30:08.833
Damn it, there's gotta be
something I can do.

30:10.417 --> 30:14.500
- Time to impact?
- '1.3 hours.'

30:22.208 --> 30:24.000
(Jason)
'We need to speak.'

30:25.625 --> 30:29.458
The Psi Corps is dedicated
to one thing, commander.

30:30.125 --> 30:31.708
Control.

30:31.792 --> 30:37.000
Control over telepaths,
the economy, the courts.

30:37.083 --> 30:40.417
Over matter,
over thought itself.

30:40.500 --> 30:43.417
But there is something
even more powerful.

30:43.500 --> 30:45.750
Something they didn't
even know existed

30:45.833 --> 30:48.083
until I crossed the line.

30:48.167 --> 30:52.583
Not mind over matter,
mind over energy.

30:53.833 --> 30:56.583
I was suddenly able
to influence objects

30:56.667 --> 30:59.208
that were smaller
and smaller.

30:59.292 --> 31:03.542
Molecules, atoms, neutrons.

31:03.625 --> 31:07.917
I look at you, commander,
and I see not a man

31:08.000 --> 31:10.792
but a galaxy
of subatomic particles

31:10.875 --> 31:13.583
which I can pull apart
and rearrange

31:13.667 --> 31:15.625
with a casual thought.

31:15.708 --> 31:18.792
This is a power
we were never meant to have.

31:18.875 --> 31:20.417
We're not ready for it.

31:20.500 --> 31:23.042
If the Psi Cops take him back,
they'll dissect him.

31:23.125 --> 31:25.167
Taking him apart to find out
what combination of drugs

31:25.250 --> 31:26.750
release this power.

31:26.833 --> 31:30.083
Can you imagine, commander,
what they would do with it?

31:30.167 --> 31:31.792
What anyone would do with it?

31:31.875 --> 31:34.042
Which is exactly why they say
you shouldn't be allowed

31:34.125 --> 31:36.208
to leave here alive.

31:36.292 --> 31:38.458
Why should I trust you
to not misuse this?

31:38.542 --> 31:40.292
I've already
had six people hurt.

31:40.375 --> 31:45.958
An accident. At each new level,
it takes me a while to adjust.

31:46.042 --> 31:48.333
I have to fight
every minute to control

31:48.417 --> 31:50.250
the forces in my head.

31:50.333 --> 31:52.625
If I'm distracted
for even a second--

31:52.708 --> 31:54.792
What about the researcher
you killed?

31:54.875 --> 31:56.625
I didn't want to.

31:56.708 --> 32:00.333
But he was the only one
who could replicate the process.

32:00.417 --> 32:03.667
There must never be
any more like me.

32:04.917 --> 32:07.583
I mean you no harm, commander.

32:07.667 --> 32:12.250
If I did, I could vaporize you
right now with a single thought.

32:13.208 --> 32:16.625
Please, you must believe me.

32:20.417 --> 32:24.125
Assuming I do,
what is it you want from me?

32:24.208 --> 32:30.042
Your help and your trust.
I need to get away from here.

32:30.125 --> 32:33.708
I need time to finish becoming

32:35.042 --> 32:36.625
and then I'll be gone.

32:38.375 --> 32:40.125
Please.

32:41.625 --> 32:42.875
[sighs]

32:44.250 --> 32:46.625
- Sinclair to C and C.
- This is C and C.

32:46.708 --> 32:48.667
- Are you alright, commander?
- Condition green.

32:48.750 --> 32:50.875
- Is Garibaldi there?
- Right here.

'I don't want to see anyone
on the way and I don't want'

32:56.417 --> 32:58.750
'anyone outside security
to know what's going on.'

32:58.833 --> 33:00.125
'Is that clear?'

33:00.208 --> 33:01.708
Confirmed, commander.
What's up?

33:01.792 --> 33:03.083
(Jeff)
'We're coming out.'

33:03.167 --> 33:05.292

'Two ships detected.
Now entering local space.'

33:20.083 --> 33:24.375
What? Where?
Put it on the monitor.

33:28.167 --> 33:30.292
This is an emergency request.

33:30.375 --> 33:32.625
This is Catherine Sakai
of the Earth survey ship Sky--

33:32.708 --> 33:35.833
(Sh'Drog)
'Of the Earth ship Skydancer.
Yes. We know.'

33:35.917 --> 33:38.667
You what?
Please identify yourself.

33:38.750 --> 33:41.083
Captain Sh'Drog
of the Narn Regime.

33:41.167 --> 33:44.375
Outer sector, fighter unit,
we were dispatched sometime ago

33:44.458 --> 33:45.583
to assist you.

33:45.667 --> 33:47.000
Dispatched by whom?

33:47.083 --> 33:49.792
Ambassador G'Kar, Third Circle.

33:49.875 --> 33:51.375
Please stand by for grapple.

33:51.458 --> 33:55.750
We will link up and escort you
back to Babylon 5. Sh'Drog out.

- Just a drill, sir.

34:17.375 --> 34:19.667
- Nothing to be concerned about.
- You're sure?

34:19.750 --> 34:23.750
- Yes, I'm..
- Good. Thank you.

34:29.500 --> 34:32.417
[groaning]

34:38.958 --> 34:40.792
[groans]
No.

34:47.292 --> 34:51.000
No, no, I refuse.

34:51.083 --> 34:53.125
I am not going back with you.

34:54.708 --> 34:56.500
This man is under my protection.

34:56.583 --> 35:00.500
You don't know
what you're doing!

35:00.583 --> 35:04.500
Commander, we have to hurry.
There's not much..

35:07.042 --> 35:09.458
The fail-safe code.
They're trying to shut him down.

35:10.917 --> 35:14.833
Mindquakes. They're distracting
him. He's losing control.

35:14.917 --> 35:16.667
[rumbling]

35:18.292 --> 35:19.375
Let him go.

35:22.417 --> 35:24.333
Do you hear me?
Let him go.

35:25.458 --> 35:27.083
[groaning]

35:27.167 --> 35:29.333
[grunting]

35:30.583 --> 35:33.333
- I won't go.
- Leave him alone.

35:33.417 --> 35:34.875
You don't understand.

35:34.958 --> 35:36.458
[screams]

35:37.750 --> 35:39.750
I won't go back.

35:42.292 --> 35:45.792
Please, no.
Don't make me do this.

35:47.625 --> 35:50.083
You cannot harm me.

35:50.167 --> 35:53.500
You cannot harm one who has
dreamed a dream like mine.

- No. No time.

36:26.875 --> 36:31.500

Must get to the ship.
Hurry. Hurry.

36:33.083 --> 36:35.625
[dramatic music]

36:40.000 --> 36:42.083
- What's he doing?
- Nothing.

36:42.167 --> 36:43.417
He's not moving
to the jump-gate.

36:43.500 --> 36:45.250
He's just sitting there.

36:48.333 --> 36:50.042
(female #2)
'Picking up energy surge.'

36:51.125 --> 36:52.958
- How big?
- Off the scale.

Talia?

37:20.292 --> 37:22.458
Jason?

37:22.542 --> 37:24.958
(Jason)
I have become.

37:26.542 --> 37:31.167
In memory of love,
I give you a gift.

37:31.250 --> 37:34.542
The only gift I have to give.

37:37.250 --> 37:39.417
[instrumental music]

37:48.583 --> 37:50.708
Goodbye, commander.

37:50.792 --> 37:54.875
I will see you again...
in a million years.

37:59.208 --> 38:01.458
You realize of course
my superiors

38:01.542 --> 38:03.250
will believe none of this?

38:03.333 --> 38:06.333
Yes, especially since,
in about an hour

38:06.417 --> 38:08.583
we'll have a small accident
in data storage

38:08.667 --> 38:10.833
that'll erase
the file you just saw.

38:10.917 --> 38:14.333
- So what do you suggest?
- Something close to the truth.

38:14.417 --> 38:16.542
That Ironheart's ship
escaped Babylon 5

38:16.625 --> 38:18.542
but exploded before it could
enter the jump gate.

38:18.625 --> 38:19.917
And if I refuse?

38:20.000 --> 38:22.708
Then my report will mention
how you lied to us

38:22.792 --> 38:24.125
endangered the station

38:24.208 --> 38:25.375
and through
your interference caused

38:25.458 --> 38:27.333
the death of your fellow
Psi Cop.

38:28.583 --> 38:30.125
Not much of a choice, is it?

38:30.208 --> 38:32.833
It gets better,
your report will indicate that

38:32.917 --> 38:34.583
Talia Winters
was not responsible

38:34.667 --> 38:36.542
for her actions
in helping Ironheart.

38:36.625 --> 38:38.292
That she was under
his mental control

38:38.375 --> 38:40.708
and should not be penalized
for her actions.

38:40.792 --> 38:42.875
- That's a lie.
- Yes, it is.

38:42.958 --> 38:44.458
What's your point?

38:44.542 --> 38:47.958
There's a transport leaving for
Earth in 20 minutes, Mr. Bester.

38:48.042 --> 38:49.500
Be on it.

39:00.667 --> 39:02.292
Be seeing you, commander.

39:06.917 --> 39:08.667
You figuring on telling
the senator what Ironheart said

39:08.750 --> 39:11.167
about Psi Corps trying to
control everything inside?

39:11.250 --> 39:14.417
I don't know. I'm not sure
what it would accomplish.

39:14.500 --> 39:19.125
He was feverish. Paranoid.
Maybe it's true, maybe it isn't.

39:19.208 --> 39:21.042
Without any evidence,
without Ironheart

39:21.125 --> 39:23.458
it's just
his word against the Corps.

39:23.542 --> 39:26.833
But I suggest we keep our eyes
open just in case.

39:26.917 --> 39:31.750
- Got that right. How's Talia?
- Better. Resting.

39:31.833 --> 39:34.042
Good, I wonder
what Ironheart meant

39:34.125 --> 39:36.083
when he said he gave her a gift?

39:36.167 --> 39:38.583
If I asked, do you think
she'd tell me?

39:38.667 --> 39:39.750
No.

39:40.667 --> 39:43.208
[instrumental music]

40:11.958 --> 40:13.917
[intense music]

40:14.000 --> 40:16.042
Ambassador!
Ambassador G'Kar?

40:16.125 --> 40:18.083
Ah, Ms. Sakai,
I'm pleased to see

40:18.167 --> 40:20.833
that you have returned safely
from your expedition.

40:20.917 --> 40:24.333
Yes, thanks to you.
Just one question.

40:24.417 --> 40:25.958
- Why?
- Why not?

40:26.042 --> 40:27.750
- It's not an answer.
- Oh, yes, it is.

40:27.833 --> 40:30.917
It's simply not an answer you
like or the answer you expect.

40:31.000 --> 40:32.250
There's a difference.

40:32.333 --> 40:35.250
Narns, humans, Centauri,
we all do what we do

40:35.333 --> 40:36.667
for the same reason

40:36.750 --> 40:39.708
because it seemed
like a good idea at the time.

40:39.792 --> 40:42.542
There was no profit,
no advantage in letting you fall

40:42.625 --> 40:45.792
to an untimely and most
uncomfortable death.

40:45.875 --> 40:49.375
It would distress the commander
to no good effect.

40:49.458 --> 40:52.625
So once again we return to,
"Why not?"

40:53.583 --> 40:55.500
I told you before you left

40:55.583 --> 40:59.958
no one here
is entirely what they appear.

41:00.042 --> 41:03.000
If I surprised you,
all the better.

41:04.333 --> 41:05.708
Good day, Ms. Sakai.

41:06.875 --> 41:08.458
Ambassador.

41:10.292 --> 41:14.750
While I was out there,
I saw something.

41:14.833 --> 41:16.625
What was it?

41:18.875 --> 41:20.167
What is this?

41:21.625 --> 41:23.542
- An ant.
- Ant?

41:23.625 --> 41:26.167
So much gets shipped out from
Earth on commercial transports

41:26.250 --> 41:27.583
it's hard to keep them out.

41:27.667 --> 41:31.167
Yeah, I have just picked it up
on the tip of my glove.

41:31.250 --> 41:36.208
If I put it down again
and it asks another ant

41:36.292 --> 41:37.792
"What was that?"

41:37.875 --> 41:41.083
[chuckles]
how would it explain?

41:41.167 --> 41:44.417
There are things in
the universe billions of years

41:44.500 --> 41:46.750
older than either of our races.

41:46.833 --> 41:50.000
They are vast, timeless

41:50.083 --> 41:52.500
and if they're aware
of us at all..

41:52.583 --> 41:55.125
...it is as little
more than ants.

41:55.208 --> 41:59.000
And we have as much chance
of communicating with them..

41:59.083 --> 42:01.875
...as an ant has with us.

42:01.958 --> 42:04.750
We know, we've tried.

42:04.833 --> 42:07.042
And we've learned
that we can either stay out

42:07.125 --> 42:09.833
from underfoot or be stepped on.

42:12.208 --> 42:15.667
That's it?
That's all you know?

42:15.750 --> 42:18.708
Yes. They are a mystery.

42:19.833 --> 42:23.625
And I am both terrified
and reassured

42:23.708 --> 42:27.458
to know that there are still
wonders in the universe

42:27.542 --> 42:31.833
that we have not yet
explained everything.

42:31.917 --> 42:36.625
Whatever they are, Ms. Sakai,
they walk near Sigma 957.

42:36.708 --> 42:39.208
They must walk there alone.

42:40.375 --> 42:43.458
