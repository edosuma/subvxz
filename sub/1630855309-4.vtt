<i>Now serving D46 at counter three.</i>

00:09.458 --> 00:12.958
<i>Now serving D46 at counter three.</i>

00:12.958 --> 00:15.500
Ugh, the DMV fucking sucks.

00:15.500 --> 00:17.166
Totally, Van.

00:17.166 --> 00:20.541
What a hot and sexy take. Say more.

00:20.541 --> 00:22.166
What's up with you today?

00:22.166 --> 00:24.041
Nothing-uh.

00:24.041 --> 00:28.583
I mean, Van is just, like, so fascinating.
No? I-I think so.

00:28.583 --> 00:29.791
Take it easy, Emmy.

00:29.791 --> 00:33.750
Oh, I'm very easy. Everybody knows it.

00:33.750 --> 00:37.333
- Ugh, it's Ben.
- Ooh, it's Ben! The urinal guy!

00:37.333 --> 00:38.958
"You around tonight?"

00:38.958 --> 00:42.041
"Wanna martini emoji?"

00:42.041 --> 00:43.833
All right, we need an excuse.

00:43.833 --> 00:47.000
You're out of town.
You've got an aunt thing in Colorado.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.916
- Got it. "Aunt thing."
- Wait. What's an "aunt thing"?

00:49.916 --> 00:52.958
No one knows. It sounds specific,
but it conveys nothing.

00:52.958 --> 00:55.041
We've used it to bail on so many people.

00:55.041 --> 00:58.041
Yeah, no, no, it makes sense.
Aunts are frail.

00:58.041 --> 01:01.250
Um, but couldn't we also
just get the drink with Ben?

01:01.250 --> 01:02.208
Definitely not.

01:02.208 --> 01:05.500
But the dong did respectable work,
and he was sweet.

01:05.500 --> 01:06.500
Mmm, nah.

01:06.500 --> 01:10.250
<i>- Now serving D47 at counter nine.</i>
- Oh, that's me. Aunt thing sent.

01:10.250 --> 01:16.041
Cool. Uh, we'll just be here then.
Uh, me and Van's exposed clavicle.

01:17.500 --> 01:21.000
So, how have you been?
Since the last time I... Since-- Since we--

01:21.000 --> 01:23.500
- Since we kissed?
- Kissed, yes kissed.

01:23.500 --> 01:24.833
We-- When we were kissing.

01:24.833 --> 01:27.083
I've been good. And kissing's fun.

01:27.083 --> 01:30.833
I must say,
I do find you oddly compelling.

01:30.833 --> 01:36.125
And I find you to be the prettiest
lady rock in the history of the world.

01:36.125 --> 01:37.708
But you're too into me,

01:37.708 --> 01:40.875
and I don't do
your Lovebug relationship thingies.

01:40.875 --> 01:44.916
Well, that's cool, I'm not even
interested in a relationship, bro.

01:44.916 --> 01:47.833
- Let's get married.
- Absolutely. Let's do it in Santa Barbara.

01:47.833 --> 01:48.958
See? Too into me.

01:48.958 --> 01:51.875
Okay, okay.
We're not getting married.

01:51.875 --> 01:54.041
But, uh, can we still make out?

01:54.041 --> 01:56.708
We'll see. But right now
I gotta go help Sarah.

01:56.708 --> 02:00.375
Okay, I'll be here,
not wanting a relationship.

02:00.375 --> 02:04.083
Little do you know,
I am such a good kisser,

02:04.083 --> 02:06.458
you will want to marry me.

02:06.458 --> 02:08.208
Woo-woo!

- No.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.500
- Well, don't be.
- I'm not.

02:48.500 --> 02:51.833
Good, because it's just an internship.
It doesn't even count.

02:51.833 --> 02:54.500
I mean, it's like you're barely
even a Shame Wizard.

02:54.500 --> 02:57.000
- I am too a Shame Wizard.
- Okay, fine.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.500
- You said you'd respect my choice.
- It's a bad choice though.

02:59.500 --> 03:00.875
- You promised.
- I know.

03:00.875 --> 03:02.708
Hey! Shut the hell up!

03:02.708 --> 03:07.083
Montel, I think you're gonna be
a lovely Shame Wizard.

03:07.083 --> 03:09.458
Thank you, Connie Mommy.
You're my favorite.

03:09.458 --> 03:12.375
- Goes without saying.
-"Goes without saying." Blech.

03:13.250 --> 03:15.000
There they are.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.750
- All right!
- It's our coach.

03:16.750 --> 03:20.375
That's right. Happy softball season,
A-Rods and A-Holes.

03:20.375 --> 03:23.416
- And there's our star slugger.
- Say, Joe, knuckle me a donut.

03:23.416 --> 03:25.625
Mm-hmm. Here comes a heater.

03:27.333 --> 03:28.416
- Yeah.
- There you go.

03:28.416 --> 03:31.458
And that's how we're gonna do it
this season. But with a ball.

03:31.458 --> 03:32.583
Hell yeah!

03:32.583 --> 03:34.791
So there's an office softball league?

03:34.791 --> 03:37.458
- Yeah.
- How very pre-gig-economy.

03:37.458 --> 03:40.875
Your mother is actually
a pretty legendary hitter.

03:40.875 --> 03:45.291
Back in the Jazz Age,
she hit a ball so hard, it shat itself.

03:45.291 --> 03:46.791
Now approaching the plate,

03:46.791 --> 03:50.375
that hotsy-totsy dame
they call Lil Syphilis.

03:50.375 --> 03:52.041
That's right, because her swing,

03:52.041 --> 03:55.500
just like the infection,
is lethal in this era.

03:57.125 --> 03:59.708
What in the F. Scott Shitzgerald?

03:59.708 --> 04:03.291
Oh my God, it's a Great Shatsby.

04:03.291 --> 04:07.041
That moment gave us all a little hope
in a time of...

04:07.041 --> 04:08.416
so much jazz.

04:08.416 --> 04:11.375
There you are. My uncompensated protégé.

04:11.375 --> 04:14.750
- Tell me, can you play shortstop?
- Whatever you need, boss.

04:14.750 --> 04:16.750
Connie Mommy, look.

04:16.750 --> 04:19.708
I'm a hot little slice of Americana,
just like you.

04:19.708 --> 04:23.416
Oh, you play on whichever team
you want, okay, baby?

04:23.416 --> 04:24.708
Okay.

04:24.708 --> 04:26.083
But if you play against me,

04:26.083 --> 04:29.166
I'll make you shit like a ball.

04:29.166 --> 04:31.791
- Oh.
- Have a good first day, kiddo.

04:32.375 --> 04:34.625
Um, are you guys in there again?

04:34.625 --> 04:37.625
- Get your stupid staples later, Ethan.
- Well, maybe I will.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.125
- You're naughty.
- Not naughty, Pete. Hateful.

04:42.125 --> 04:43.666
I hate Dante.

04:43.666 --> 04:46.083
- Ooh!
- I hate that glitter-titted Hope.

04:46.083 --> 04:47.208
Oh God, yeah.

04:47.208 --> 04:51.833
And I hate that you're still wearing
that dorky little outfit of yours.

04:52.958 --> 04:55.666
Oh, uh... [chuckles] That was a $30 tie,

04:55.666 --> 04:57.541
but, you know what,
whatever the lady likes.

04:57.541 --> 05:01.583
Well, the lady would like you
dick naked and cheeks up, now.

05:03.666 --> 05:05.375
Hoo!

05:05.375 --> 05:08.000
Now that's what I call intercourse.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.250
All right, Pete. I'm out.

05:09.250 --> 05:11.625
Bring that rubble butt
back here at lunchtime.

05:11.625 --> 05:13.833
Um...

05:13.833 --> 05:18.083
Speaking of my buttocks,
I was thinking about, uh, you know,

05:18.083 --> 05:21.916
other things you could bite,
like, I don't know, a nice meal sometime?

05:21.916 --> 05:22.833
A what?

05:22.833 --> 05:25.000
Well, uh, maybe even two meals.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.666
Vigorous coitus demands nutrients.

05:26.666 --> 05:29.125
No dates.
That's not how hate-fucking works.

05:29.125 --> 05:31.375
Oh, uh, "hate-fucking." I see.

05:31.375 --> 05:34.208
Look, when you're a worm,
all fuckin' is hate-fuckin'.

05:34.208 --> 05:36.000
- It's not personal.
- Oh! Heh.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.625
"Not personal." Uh, so you don't hate me?

05:39.625 --> 05:42.208
- Not particularly.
- Well, heh, cool beans then.

05:42.208 --> 05:44.083
Yeah, cool beans, Pete.

05:44.083 --> 05:48.000
Okay, well, I'm gonna, uh, go urinate,
so I don't get a UTI.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.458
I suggest you do the same.

05:51.375 --> 05:53.041
Hey, Pete, do these shiny lips

05:53.041 --> 05:56.083
make you wanna kiss
and eventually marry me?

05:56.083 --> 05:58.541
- Uh...
- I mean, if you were Van.

05:58.541 --> 06:02.416
Ohh, I see. Sounds like you two
are getting serious.

06:02.416 --> 06:05.916
Oh, you know. [giggles] Kinda serious.

06:05.916 --> 06:08.666
I mean, she keeps telling me
she doesn't want a relationship,

06:08.666 --> 06:10.416
but I'm gonna show her how wrong she is.

06:10.416 --> 06:12.250
- We're cute.
- Well, cheers.

06:12.250 --> 06:16.250
You know, incidentally,
I also have romantic news about Rochelle.

06:16.250 --> 06:18.083
Shut up. Tell me everything. Shut up!

06:18.083 --> 06:19.791
Okay, okay, I'll tell you two things.

06:19.791 --> 06:23.375
Supply closet and...
...ten minutes ago.

06:24.708 --> 06:26.875
Holy holy shit!

06:26.875 --> 06:28.916
Yeah. It's all happening.

06:28.916 --> 06:32.875
Me in the relationship I've always wanted,
you getting back out there. Look at us go.

06:32.875 --> 06:34.625
We're thriving this season.

06:34.625 --> 06:37.875
Everything is coming up Pete and Emmy.

06:37.875 --> 06:40.250
All right. Well, I'll let you return
to your seduction.

06:40.250 --> 06:43.541
And I'll let you get back
to humping in storage.

06:43.541 --> 06:45.958
Man, I love a sexy office romance.

06:45.958 --> 06:48.166
Wait. "Office romance"?

06:48.166 --> 06:50.750
- Huh?
- Oh my God, that's exactly what it is.

06:50.750 --> 06:53.125
Emmy! Emmy! We have to get
to Creature Administrations

06:53.125 --> 06:55.000
and report our workplace liaisons.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.625
Cool, I'll meet you down there.
Hope there are forms.

06:57.625 --> 07:01.500
Ho-ho, you won't be disappointed, friend.
There are so many forms.

07:01.500 --> 07:03.333
Yeah, no, I'm goin' this way.

07:03.833 --> 07:05.583
Yeah, that's it, Black Cloaks,

07:05.583 --> 07:09.541
get better at the thing
you'll do in the game.

07:09.541 --> 07:11.666
You know, the-- the thing.

07:11.666 --> 07:12.750
Pathetic.

07:14.250 --> 07:17.000
Of course they're not a real threat, Moneyballs.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.916
- But a little intel never hurts.
- Oh!

07:19.916 --> 07:21.375
What's this now?

07:21.375 --> 07:23.625
Yes, Montel. Never stop.

07:23.625 --> 07:24.958
Oh, shit.

07:27.750 --> 07:29.833
- Uh, here. You're gonna need all of this.
- Mm?

07:29.833 --> 07:33.458
HGH? Bull steroids?
What is all this shit for?

07:33.458 --> 07:36.416
It's Montel. They're good. Uh, too good.

07:36.416 --> 07:38.958
They might even be
a better softball player than y--

07:38.958 --> 07:40.083
How dare!

07:40.083 --> 07:44.625
Hey, if you're mad, then why did you do
the sexiest possible thing to me?

07:44.625 --> 07:46.166
Ah!

07:46.166 --> 07:48.958
It's all incredibly hot.
I-- I-- I don't know what to tell you.

07:48.958 --> 07:51.958
Well, I don't need your stupid pills
to win this game.

07:51.958 --> 07:53.583
- But, Connie--
- Please observe.

07:53.583 --> 07:57.375
Hey, Sonya, one softball shit
on the rocks, please.

07:57.375 --> 07:59.875
Uh, we don't have softball shit.

07:59.875 --> 08:02.583
Oh, my mistake and my apologies.

08:02.583 --> 08:05.458
Why, pray tell,
don't you have softball shit?

08:05.458 --> 08:10.541
Because it hasn't existed since the 1920s
when you hit that homer.

08:10.541 --> 08:12.541
That will be all, Sonya. Thank you.

08:12.541 --> 08:16.333
Point taken, okay? You're the best,
and I should not have questioned that.

08:16.333 --> 08:17.250
Thank you, Maury.

08:17.250 --> 08:21.125
Well, if you really wanna thank me,
you'll slap me around some more.

08:21.125 --> 08:23.041
Maybe step on my nuts?

08:23.041 --> 08:24.125
Yeah, all right.

08:24.125 --> 08:28.166
Get those suckers on the bar,
and I'll get my Doc Martens.

08:31.333 --> 08:33.666
Oh, hello, sleepy Sarah.

08:33.666 --> 08:35.958
Hello, random sex man.

08:35.958 --> 08:37.333
And, oh, hey, Van.

08:37.333 --> 08:41.458
Fancy meeting you here
with my lips all glossed up and kissable.

08:41.458 --> 08:43.791
They do look very wet.

08:43.791 --> 08:46.000
But they're really just sticky.

08:47.375 --> 08:49.125
- Time to skedaddle?
- Right. Skedaddle.

08:49.125 --> 08:51.500
We skedaddle because we, as a collective,

08:51.500 --> 08:53.666
don't give a shit about relationships,

08:53.666 --> 08:56.666
even though it is nice
to have a partner to share your life with.

08:56.666 --> 08:57.750
Emmy...

08:57.750 --> 09:02.208
What? I'm not talking about us.
I meant theoretically.

09:02.791 --> 09:05.291
Where the hell is the door? Ow!

09:05.291 --> 09:07.041
Oh my God. Shit. I-I'm so sorry.

09:07.041 --> 09:10.041
I was getting water.
I didn't even see you. Sarah?

09:10.041 --> 09:11.416
- Ben?
- It's Ben! Ben's here!

09:11.416 --> 09:12.791
What the fuck?

09:12.791 --> 09:16.041
What the fuck me?
Uh, this is... [chuckles] ...my home.

09:16.041 --> 09:18.291
So what the fuck you, actually.

09:18.291 --> 09:20.916
Wha... Oh God, this is the same apartment.

09:20.916 --> 09:25.125
Which we could not have known.
Every dude lives in this apartment.

09:25.125 --> 09:28.458
Uh, so, are you stalking me or something?

09:28.458 --> 09:30.708
Ew, no! I-- I was just...

09:30.708 --> 09:31.916
I, um...

09:32.875 --> 09:35.833
...went home with some guy,

09:35.833 --> 09:39.625
and it turns out he's your roommate.

09:39.625 --> 09:41.625
Oh, wow. With Cody?

09:41.625 --> 09:43.250
Yep, I know. I'm an asshole.

09:43.250 --> 09:45.500
Uh, I'm getting an Uber and leaving.

09:45.500 --> 09:49.875
So I guess your "aunt thing"
was just not wanting to hang out with me?

09:49.875 --> 09:52.875
- Aw, Sarah, he's sad.
- Who cares?

09:52.875 --> 09:57.041
Shit. Um...
It's a 57-minute wait and it's raining.

09:57.041 --> 10:00.083
Can I take this CVS bag
so I can put it on my head?

10:01.250 --> 10:02.666
Wow. Fine. Keep it.

10:02.666 --> 10:05.708
No, that's not what I...
Look, I'll just give you a ride.

10:05.708 --> 10:09.333
I'm sorry. I like him.
I like when they provide services.

10:11.500 --> 10:13.375
You know, you could have sat up front.

10:13.375 --> 10:16.833
It's cool. Just thought
I'd keep it professional.

10:16.833 --> 10:20.875
Ugh, I really am sorry
about the "aunt thing" thing.

10:20.875 --> 10:22.208
Ew, why are you apologizing?

10:22.208 --> 10:26.291
And if it makes you feel any better,
Cody sucks at sex.

10:26.291 --> 10:29.041
That--
That does help a little bit.

10:29.041 --> 10:31.916
- You should talk to him about that.
- Actually, I don't think I will.

10:32.833 --> 10:35.583
- Vibe. Sarah, the vibe is back.
- Is not, shut up.

10:35.583 --> 10:37.875
Hey, can I ask you something weird?

10:37.875 --> 10:38.958
Uh, okay?

10:38.958 --> 10:42.333
That night that we were together,
did you steal my deodorant?

10:42.333 --> 10:45.000
- She did. She's wearing it.
- That's crazy and weird.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.125
Why-- Why would I want your deodorant?

10:47.125 --> 10:49.958
I-- I don't know. Why would you be
in my kitchen at 1:00 a.m.?

10:49.958 --> 10:52.500
- Like, are you obsessed with me...?
- Definitely not, dude.

10:52.500 --> 10:54.291
Or do you wanna murder me?

10:54.291 --> 10:57.208
- We don't. You're hot.
- I promise it's neither.

10:57.208 --> 11:01.625
But this ride was very kind,
and I guess I'm glad I ran into you.

11:01.625 --> 11:03.541
<i>Arriving at your destination.</i>

11:03.541 --> 11:06.958
- Okay, well, uh, have a good--
- We should try one date.

11:06.958 --> 11:09.583
- What?!
- Wait, right? I can't tell anymore.

11:09.583 --> 11:14.916
Knowing you has been very confusing,
but I find you... oddly compelling.

11:14.916 --> 11:17.458
- Oh my God.
- It's a coincidence.

11:17.458 --> 11:18.625
Bitch, say yes.

11:18.625 --> 11:20.458
- Nope. No, thank you.
- Um... I-- I don't kno--

11:20.458 --> 11:22.083
- Ow! I-- I have to think.
- Nope. Come on.

11:22.083 --> 11:23.666
- Good night.
- I'll text you.

11:23.666 --> 11:25.666
Yeah, I'm sure you will.

11:25.666 --> 11:27.125
I know you can't hear me, sir,

11:27.125 --> 11:29.791
but I am gonna do
everything in my damn power

11:29.791 --> 11:32.625
to help you double-dip that dick
in my girl.

11:32.625 --> 11:33.625
Good morning.

11:33.625 --> 11:37.750
I, uh, seek formal approval
to continue a workplace romance.

11:37.750 --> 11:39.958
You'll find I've completed
all mandatory forms.

11:39.958 --> 11:42.958
Oh, great. And now I get to process them.

11:42.958 --> 11:44.208
Ugh, okay.

11:44.208 --> 11:47.916
Concerned parties.
Pete Doheny. Rochelle Hillcrest.

11:47.916 --> 11:48.958
Hillhurst.

11:48.958 --> 11:51.708
The gorgeous, highly accomplished
worm on floor three.

11:51.708 --> 11:53.791
I know what you're thinking,
how did I get so lucky?

11:53.791 --> 11:57.250
I'm not thinking. Confirm that you are not
Ms. Hillhurst's supervisor.

11:57.250 --> 11:58.166
Confirmed.

11:58.166 --> 12:00.708
- Has there been any harassment?
- Oh, not at all.

12:00.708 --> 12:05.416
Uh, although, <i>her ass meant</i>
a great deal to me when I first saw it.

12:05.416 --> 12:07.166
Please, sir. I have a migraine.

12:07.166 --> 12:09.208
- Sorry.
- Now, is this an exclusive relationship?

12:09.208 --> 12:10.916
Oh, uh... Well, no.

12:10.916 --> 12:14.125
I would welcome that, of course,
but she's still getting over her--

12:14.125 --> 12:17.500
Do you discuss confidential
client information on dates?

12:17.500 --> 12:19.250
"Dates," you said?

12:19.250 --> 12:20.541
Dates.

12:20.541 --> 12:23.166
Um, well, see, the thing is,
Rochelle would happily starve

12:23.166 --> 12:24.833
before she'd sit in a restaurant with me.

12:24.833 --> 12:26.250
That has been made clear.

12:26.250 --> 12:30.791
So frankly, Mr. Questions,
I'm not sure to which "dates" you refer.

12:30.791 --> 12:34.041
Okay, man.
I think you filled out the wrong form.

12:34.041 --> 12:35.958
Okay, well,
now you're embarrassing yourself

12:35.958 --> 12:38.333
because I do not fill out incorrect forms.

12:38.333 --> 12:44.333
So please process my Form 7413B
for a Workplace Romance.

12:44.333 --> 12:49.500
No, because you're supposed
to fill out a 7413D

12:49.500 --> 12:54.083
for Sad Little Fuck-Puppets
Getting Used For Sex By Their Coworker.

12:54.083 --> 12:56.916
It can't possibly say that on the...

12:56.916 --> 12:58.125
Oh my God, it does.

12:58.125 --> 12:59.916
Please leave if you're going to cry.

12:59.916 --> 13:02.375
My union says
I don't have to look at that.

13:52.666 --> 13:54.750
Let's play some basketball!

13:54.750 --> 13:56.125
- USA!
- Woo-hoo!

13:56.125 --> 13:59.625
This pitcher throws a sinker,
so remember, keep your eye on the ball.

13:59.625 --> 14:02.708
She could even throw a change-up,
in which case, remember,

14:02.708 --> 14:04.583
keep your eye on the ball.

14:04.583 --> 14:06.125
I got it.

14:06.125 --> 14:07.041
The hell?

14:07.041 --> 14:08.791
Oh, hey, Mamas.

14:08.791 --> 14:13.125
Lionel's got Montel pitching now too?
That filthy cheat.

14:13.125 --> 14:16.541
That was not in the game plan
I stole from his office.

14:16.541 --> 14:18.875
<i>Here comes the first pitch.</i>

14:18.875 --> 14:20.291
Strike one.

14:20.291 --> 14:21.708
Oh, my.

14:22.333 --> 14:23.416
Strike two.

14:23.416 --> 14:26.125
Connie can't strike out, right?
I mean, she never strikes out.

14:26.125 --> 14:28.750
You know what she <i>should</i> do?
Keep her eye on--

14:28.750 --> 14:29.958
- She knows that, Gil.
- Ahh!

14:29.958 --> 14:33.500
All right, I hope
you enjoyed playtime, baby.

14:33.500 --> 14:36.291
Because Mama's gonna
put you to bed now.

14:36.291 --> 14:37.458
Oh!

14:37.458 --> 14:39.833
- Strike three!
- Oh, my gosh!

14:39.833 --> 14:43.583
Holy shit! Mom, did you see that?

14:43.583 --> 14:45.000
'Cause if you did,

14:45.000 --> 14:46.250
you should've hit it.

14:46.250 --> 14:48.333
Wow, just wow.

14:48.333 --> 14:54.291
The unflappable Connie LaCienega
very much flapped at the top of the game.

14:54.291 --> 14:57.500
Tyler! How can you eat nachos
at a time like this?

14:57.500 --> 14:59.208
They're jalapeño nachos.

14:59.208 --> 15:02.833
They make my semen <i>muy picante.</i>

15:02.833 --> 15:04.958
Oh my God! I struck out.

15:04.958 --> 15:09.541
That little fuckin' nobody's
trying to steal my game.

15:09.541 --> 15:11.625
- You should have kept your eye--
- Don't you...

15:11.625 --> 15:13.166
I know you're mad,

15:13.166 --> 15:16.208
but you're making me hard
in front of the team.

15:17.375 --> 15:19.916
- Okay, let's see here.
- Could we make this a quickie?

15:19.916 --> 15:22.583
I want to get back for the 7th-inning
stretch-out-your-asshole.

15:22.583 --> 15:24.750
- You got it, Mona.
- You called this meeting?

15:24.750 --> 15:28.708
Why, yes, I did, and by the end of it,
you're gonna wanna go on a date.

15:28.708 --> 15:30.541
Really? With you?

15:30.541 --> 15:35.125
No, I meant Ben and Sarah,
but it's good to know you wanna date me.

15:35.125 --> 15:37.916
- You're relentless.
- And a little delusional.

15:37.916 --> 15:40.500
Sarah and Ben.

15:40.500 --> 15:43.125
What the fuck? Emmy made a PowerPoint?

15:43.125 --> 15:46.625
They've had not one, but two meet-cutes.

15:46.625 --> 15:49.833
Some would call that a meet-<i>two</i>-t.

15:49.833 --> 15:51.416
Some would call it fate.

15:51.416 --> 15:54.916
Well, some would call fate
"very not real."

15:54.916 --> 15:57.208
Logical objections, naturally.

15:57.208 --> 16:00.166
All of which I've addressed
in my upcoming slides.

16:00.166 --> 16:02.750
I'll show 'em to you, if you ask nicely.

16:02.750 --> 16:04.750
All right, Boss Baby Emmy.

16:04.750 --> 16:06.875
Show me your slides please.

16:06.875 --> 16:08.166
What's going on with you two?

16:08.166 --> 16:10.250
Why are you breathing
at each other so much?

16:10.250 --> 16:14.375
As you can see in slide two,
human life is short,

16:14.375 --> 16:18.000
which by Van's own logic,
means humans should, uh...

16:18.000 --> 16:22.583
- What was that rule again?
- Minimize pain, maximize pleasure.

16:22.583 --> 16:26.291
Exactly. Well, guess what
I find pleasurable.

16:26.291 --> 16:27.208
Love.

16:27.208 --> 16:29.750
You think the urinal guy is true love?

16:29.750 --> 16:32.000
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.250
I think he's new love.

16:34.250 --> 16:37.750
Floaty, buzzy horniness

16:37.750 --> 16:40.750
that's so loud you can't taste food.

16:40.750 --> 16:43.458
- That's maximum pleasure.
- Yes to the date!

16:43.458 --> 16:46.708
I got a pulse in my vag too.
Let's text what's-his-face.

16:46.708 --> 16:51.291
Damn, Em. I had no idea
you could be so analytical.

16:51.291 --> 16:55.208
Oh, it's always my pleasure
to analyze this.

16:55.208 --> 16:59.041
Sexy fucking movie!
Fist each other right now, or I quit.

16:59.041 --> 17:02.333
So, Van, what do you say? One date?

17:02.333 --> 17:05.791
All right, one date.
But just to shut you up.

17:05.791 --> 17:07.208
Baby, I'll take it.

17:07.208 --> 17:12.625
Clits ahoy! Stick around, lesbians.
After this, more softball.

17:12.625 --> 17:15.583
<i>It's the bottom of the fourth,
and the Black Cloaks,</i>

17:15.583 --> 17:17.125
<i>well, they could use a rally, honey.</i>

17:17.125 --> 17:21.250
All right, let's go, Black Cloaks.
Come on. Let's see her.

17:21.250 --> 17:22.500
<i>It's a pop fly.</i>

17:22.500 --> 17:25.166
<i>But there seems to be
an open fly in the outfield.</i>

17:26.333 --> 17:29.041
- <i>Lo siento,</i> grass.
<i>-</i> Tyler! Eyes up, dick down.

17:29.041 --> 17:30.041
Oh!

17:30.625 --> 17:31.541
<i>He's safe.</i>

17:31.541 --> 17:34.291
With that, the Black Cloaks
have three Wizards on base.

17:34.291 --> 17:37.291
Not unlike Les Claypool,
Sir Paul McCartney,

17:37.291 --> 17:39.875
and Flea from the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

17:39.875 --> 17:41.250
That's three wizards...

17:42.750 --> 17:44.416
...on bass.

17:44.416 --> 17:49.000
Oh God. The time has come.
Gil, hand me my anal beads.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.458
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the long dong is with thee.

17:51.458 --> 17:54.791
<i>Montel LaBeverley
steps up to the plate.</i>

17:54.791 --> 17:56.875
Do your thing, rookie.

17:56.875 --> 18:00.416
Psst! Montel!
I hear Joe's gonna throw a slider.

18:00.416 --> 18:01.750
Good luck, sugar.

18:01.750 --> 18:03.958
Aw, thanks, Connie Mommy.

18:03.958 --> 18:06.083
You lyin', big-haired bitch.

18:11.791 --> 18:16.291
<i>Geena Davis Christ,
the ball seems to be shitting.</i>

18:16.291 --> 18:18.083
<i>And pissing.</i>

18:18.083 --> 18:19.916
<i>This is a softball first.</i>

18:19.916 --> 18:21.458
It's going, going,

18:21.458 --> 18:23.875
it's in a
toxic-onscreen-marriage-to-Ben-Affleck,

18:23.875 --> 18:25.125
<i>Gone Girl!</i>

18:25.125 --> 18:27.416
<i>Grand slam, thank you, ma'am!</i>

18:27.416 --> 18:31.375
I'm God! Sports are everything to me!

18:31.375 --> 18:32.833
Oh, hey, Mama M.

18:32.833 --> 18:35.833
Gil, put these back in my ass, please.

18:35.833 --> 18:40.000
Hey, Tyler. Get over here,
and bring your spicy sack with you.

18:40.000 --> 18:40.958
Okay.

18:40.958 --> 18:42.750
Mama got a plan.

18:42.750 --> 18:45.083
I love your choice of venue.

18:45.666 --> 18:47.583
Very romantic.

18:47.583 --> 18:51.125
Yeah, I hope it isn't weird
that I used to fuck a lot of these dogs.

18:51.125 --> 18:54.041
Hey, New York's a small town.
It was bound to happen.

18:55.041 --> 18:58.875
Okay, Ben.
Rolling with the bestiality joke.

18:58.875 --> 19:01.166
I guess he is kinda fun.

19:01.166 --> 19:04.041
Do you do that sleeve thing every time?

19:04.041 --> 19:06.041
The windshield wipe? Oh, yeah.

19:06.041 --> 19:08.458
I've always prided myself
on a clean mustache.

19:08.458 --> 19:10.708
- Since sixth grade.
- Hang on. Sixth grade?

19:10.708 --> 19:13.791
Eleven years old, full Tom Selleck.

19:13.791 --> 19:16.583
Oh, this is very gorgeous.

19:16.583 --> 19:18.458
Oh, yeah. Pediatricians were puzzled.

19:18.458 --> 19:20.083
Someone wrote a paper about me.

19:20.083 --> 19:21.708
- Whoa, buddy.
- Oh, shit.

19:21.708 --> 19:24.291
Gotta keep that thing clean, right?

19:25.875 --> 19:30.708
Yes! Hell yes! Cute. Hot. Admit.

19:30.708 --> 19:34.375
Admit what?
That fate is real, and love conquers all?

19:34.375 --> 19:38.833
No, none of that. Relax.
I just meant tonight's a good night.

19:38.833 --> 19:42.791
Okay, yeah...
I guess Sarah is having a good time.

19:42.791 --> 19:45.291
<i>-</i> Just Sarah?
- Well, me too.

19:48.625 --> 19:53.041
You want real tween tragedy?
Strap in for my emo phase.

19:54.750 --> 19:55.833
Very spooky.

19:55.833 --> 19:59.041
I got mall-arrested
for stealing that spiky bracelet.

19:59.041 --> 19:59.958
Oh, wow.

19:59.958 --> 20:02.916
My mom made me wear pastels for a month
as a punishment.

20:02.916 --> 20:06.666
- Diabolical. I like your mom.
- Yeah.

20:06.666 --> 20:07.958
Wait. What did he say?

20:07.958 --> 20:11.250
Oh, uh, unless... no? Do we hate her?

20:11.250 --> 20:12.666
Dude, none of your business.

20:12.666 --> 20:16.000
What? What's going on?
Why is my mouth empty?

20:16.000 --> 20:19.291
Yeah, my-- my mom and I... Can we--
Can we talk about something else, please?

20:19.291 --> 20:23.250
Oh, of course. No, uh, sorry.
A-Absolutely.

20:23.250 --> 20:26.875
- I'm just gonna...
- Oh, right. I'll... I can un-touch you.

20:26.875 --> 20:29.416
Wait, Sarah,
what's the drama with your mama?

20:29.416 --> 20:31.750
- Not now, Emmy.
- But you're being so weird.

20:31.750 --> 20:34.083
We were having a good time. Wait, what?

20:34.083 --> 20:37.458
This was stupid. So stupid.

20:37.458 --> 20:39.333
Fucking dog shit everywhere.

20:39.333 --> 20:42.583
Van? No. What the hell are you doing
with those rocks?

20:42.583 --> 20:45.916
- Everything's fine. Just rela--
- Don't fucking tell me to relax.

20:45.916 --> 20:47.666
Okay, fine.

20:47.666 --> 20:52.458
Well, folks, the Stiff Sox
have clawed their way back to the lead

20:52.458 --> 20:54.916
and are just one out away from victory.

20:54.916 --> 20:56.291
<i>But with a big hit,</i>

20:56.291 --> 21:00.041
<i>Montel LaBeverley
could win it all for the Black Cloaks.</i>

21:00.041 --> 21:02.416
Hey, batter, batter, batter!
I love you, but please fuck up.

21:02.416 --> 21:05.375
- Batter, batter, batter!
- Come on, intern! Play like we pay you.

21:05.375 --> 21:07.291
- <i>Here comes the--</i>
- Hey, slugger.

21:07.291 --> 21:09.583
- Tyler?
- Hot-sauce delivery.

21:09.583 --> 21:14.375
It's from my balls.

21:15.333 --> 21:18.541
No!

21:20.916 --> 21:22.458
Why?! Why?!

21:22.458 --> 21:23.875
<i>Oh, jizz in the face.</i>

21:24.458 --> 21:26.625
- You're out.
- Oh, is that allowed?

21:26.625 --> 21:28.833
How are there seeds in it?!

21:28.833 --> 21:30.416
Unbelievable!

21:30.416 --> 21:33.791
The Hormone Monsters
have Nancied their Kerrigan

21:33.791 --> 21:35.083
and won it all.

21:35.083 --> 21:37.291
We did it, Connie. Great plan.

21:37.291 --> 21:39.875
Was that a gooey Gillooly or what?

21:39.875 --> 21:40.791
Nice work, kid.

21:40.791 --> 21:44.333
Oh my God, Connie, you saved the day!
I mean, you won the game!

21:44.333 --> 21:47.875
I mean, you had our child attacked,
which is awful.

21:47.875 --> 21:49.750
See? I-- I-- I got there. I got there.

21:53.250 --> 21:54.708
Another raspberry.

21:54.708 --> 21:58.208
- You sure about that, big guy?
- Of course. Hey, I'm celebrating.

21:58.208 --> 22:01.875
I'm Rochelle's certified rent-a-hole,
so cheers to me.

22:01.875 --> 22:04.625
Oh, by all means, stare.

22:04.625 --> 22:08.916
Look me in the eyes, please,
because Lord knows Rochelle won't.

22:08.916 --> 22:12.041
Hey, Pete, I think I know
what's gonna happen when I ask this,

22:12.041 --> 22:13.958
but, you okay?

22:17.166 --> 22:18.875
Yeah. What I thought.

22:18.875 --> 22:22.458
I know some people look at me
and see some big tough rock

22:22.458 --> 22:24.416
with huge muscles that are also rocks...

22:24.416 --> 22:25.333
Sure.

22:25.333 --> 22:28.500
...but underneath that,
I'm actually a pretty sensitive guy.

22:28.500 --> 22:30.000
I do see that now.

22:30.000 --> 22:33.416
A sensitive guy and a Hate Worm.
That's tricky math.

22:33.416 --> 22:35.958
Yeah, so what do you think I should do

22:35.958 --> 22:39.541
if I want a real romance
but she only wants hate sex?

22:39.541 --> 22:40.708
- Get a doll?
- What?

22:40.708 --> 22:43.916
You know, a doll that looks like her,
and I pretend it says nice things.

22:43.916 --> 22:46.541
I think what you do
is tell her the truth, Pete.

22:46.541 --> 22:47.458
Say what you need.

22:47.458 --> 22:50.541
But... she could say no
and I could lose her entirely.

22:50.541 --> 22:52.166
Well, that's the risk.

22:52.166 --> 22:54.666
If you don't wanna take it,
you can just keep being

22:54.666 --> 22:56.875
a "Sad Little Fuck-Puppet."

22:57.458 --> 23:01.500
No, Pete Doheny is more than a 7413D.

23:01.500 --> 23:03.250
I'm gonna tell her how I feel.

23:03.250 --> 23:05.083
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Hoo!

23:05.083 --> 23:07.666
That felt good.
I, uh, do have other hard copies.

23:07.666 --> 23:11.083
Plus digital backups,
both cloud and local, but, uh... Hoo!

23:11.083 --> 23:13.333
- All right. Hey!
- Yeah!

23:13.333 --> 23:16.583
Victory circle jerk. Let's go, you two.

23:16.583 --> 23:20.833
Be right with you, Joe. I, uh, wanna go
shake hands with the losers first.

23:20.833 --> 23:23.291
Not me, I wanna jack off my teammates.

23:23.291 --> 23:26.041
Got you a Shamey Temple.
Your fav--

23:26.041 --> 23:27.375
How dare!

23:27.375 --> 23:31.875
How could you, Connie, pay him, Tyler,

23:31.875 --> 23:34.541
to <i>I, Tonya</i> me, Montel?

23:34.541 --> 23:37.541
Oh my God. Stop, stop, stop.

23:37.541 --> 23:41.500
Don't even try shaming me.
It is not gonna work.

23:41.500 --> 23:44.333
Pardon me.
Professional curiosity.

23:44.333 --> 23:48.958
You're not ashamed
for temporarily blinding your own child?

23:48.958 --> 23:50.916
No, I am not.

23:50.916 --> 23:54.333
Monty, I love you, and I love lovin' you.

23:54.333 --> 23:58.708
But today, you almost surpassed me
at something I care about,

23:58.708 --> 24:01.375
and I just couldn't let that happen.

24:01.375 --> 24:05.541
Because if I surpassed you,
you'd have to stop lovin' me?

24:05.541 --> 24:07.000
Exactly.

24:07.000 --> 24:12.041
So I took a hit out on you,
and now we can be a family again.

24:12.041 --> 24:15.875
- Come here, honey.
- Oh, this is very fucked up.

24:15.875 --> 24:20.625
Somehow, I feel shame
for ever being good at softball.

24:20.625 --> 24:22.791
How did you do that?

24:22.791 --> 24:26.166
- You got all your talent from me, baby.
- Oh!

24:26.166 --> 24:28.833
I love you, you psycho bitch.

24:28.833 --> 24:34.958
So, yeah, that's why
I stopped cutting my own hair.

24:36.416 --> 24:38.291
- Crazy, right?
- Yeah, crazy.

24:38.291 --> 24:41.625
Come on, Sarah.
Why are you shutting him out?

24:41.625 --> 24:44.875
I'm sorry again about before,

24:44.875 --> 24:46.791
if I pried about your mom.

24:46.791 --> 24:50.666
- It's fine. You didn't do anything wrong.
- Yeah, exactly. He's a good man.

24:50.666 --> 24:53.291
- A mighty, mighty good man.
- Jesus, can you talk normal?

24:53.291 --> 24:55.666
I'm just saying,
I don't get what the problem is.

24:55.666 --> 24:57.041
Maybe you're the problem.

24:57.041 --> 25:01.041
Me? You're building a wall.
A literal emotional wall.

25:01.041 --> 25:02.875
Is it made of you, by the way?

25:02.875 --> 25:05.458
Or are you pooing it?
I don't know, I feel like that would hurt.

25:05.458 --> 25:07.541
Sarah, we never should've listened
to her. I'm sorry.

25:07.541 --> 25:10.041
Whoa, hi. I'm right here.

25:10.041 --> 25:12.958
Look, I don't know what the big deal
about your mom is, but--

25:12.958 --> 25:15.833
It's not about her mom.

25:15.833 --> 25:17.291
So drop it, Emmy, okay?

25:17.291 --> 25:20.958
Look, I-- I'm sorry
if I pushed too hard. I just...

25:21.458 --> 25:23.625
I wanted something great for you.

25:23.625 --> 25:26.416
I wanted something great for all of us.

25:26.416 --> 25:29.041
I-- I really thought it could be great.

25:29.041 --> 25:30.583
Well, you thought wrong.

25:30.583 --> 25:34.458

Why are you being so mean?
