WEBVTT

00:02.391 --> 00:03.612
- Chapter 25...

00:03.712 --> 00:05.795
- Anybody want some coffee?
- Oh, I would love some.

00:08.278 --> 00:09.900
- It was finally sinking in
for Connor

00:10.000 --> 00:12.223
that his girlfriend, JoJo,
was gone.

00:12.323 --> 00:15.107
So Tom and Sarah were doing
everything in their power

00:15.207 --> 00:17.030
to make their baby brother
feel better.

00:17.130 --> 00:18.872
How we doing, bro?
- How you feeling, bud?

00:18.972 --> 00:20.314
- Nope.
- Nope what?

00:20.414 --> 00:22.276
- Nope to this whole line
of questioning.

00:22.376 --> 00:23.999
- Connor, we just want you
to be comfortable--

00:24.099 --> 00:26.922
- Feeling my feelings.
Yeah, I know.

00:27.022 --> 00:28.845
How's this?
It sucks that JoJo's gone.

00:28.945 --> 00:31.568
I'm sad about it.
Feelings felt.

00:31.668 --> 00:33.611
- I'm actually reading
a Faulkner biography.

00:33.711 --> 00:36.295
He had a very similar situation
to this with his wife, Estelle.

00:36.395 --> 00:38.297
- What part of "nope"
didn't you understand?

00:38.397 --> 00:40.340
- Oh, I kind of thought
that was more for Sarah.

00:40.440 --> 00:42.062
- Nope.

00:42.162 --> 00:44.305
- Hey, well,
what if we all have dinner

00:44.405 --> 00:45.987
at our place
next Saturday night, huh?

00:46.087 --> 00:47.950
Kel and Shamiah
have sleepovers,

00:48.050 --> 00:49.271
and we never all hang out
all together.

00:49.371 --> 00:50.473
- Yes, we do.

00:50.573 --> 00:52.395
That's all we do.
We're doing it right now.

00:52.495 --> 00:55.600
- Sorry, Lulu, but Marina and I
have plans Saturday night.

00:55.700 --> 00:57.322
It's Marise night.

00:57.422 --> 00:58.764
- It's a combination
of our names,

00:58.864 --> 01:02.048
Denise and Marina.
Denina.

01:02.148 --> 01:03.410
Marinise?
- We'll find it.

01:03.510 --> 01:04.892
- It's a normals' evening

01:04.992 --> 01:06.374
of my and Denise's
favourite things.

01:06.474 --> 01:08.336
- Wine, pizza,

01:08.436 --> 01:10.899
"House Hunters" marathon,
the dream.

01:10.999 --> 01:13.783
- You guys need to start
dreaming bigger.

01:13.883 --> 01:16.066
- Okay, well, uh, what
about a siblings' night?

01:16.166 --> 01:17.708
Tom, you free?

01:17.808 --> 01:19.390
- Well, you know,
Marina handles all

01:19.490 --> 01:22.394
the scheduling in our house,
so I probably can't...

01:22.494 --> 01:23.396
- He's free.
- Do it--

01:23.496 --> 01:24.597
I'm free!
Oh, awesome.

01:24.697 --> 01:26.840
- Great.
Connor?

01:26.940 --> 01:29.444
What do you say, huh?
A little post-breakup hang?

01:29.544 --> 01:30.765
- I'll think about it.

01:30.865 --> 01:33.729
- I'll take that
noncommittal answer as a yes.

01:33.829 --> 01:36.413
- It's gonna be crunk!
- Don't forget you're taking

01:36.513 --> 01:38.575
Camila to dance class
the next morning.

01:38.675 --> 01:42.100
- It's gonna be somewhat crunk!

01:42.200 --> 01:45.745
- ♪ Hey, hey, hey, hey ♪

01:45.845 --> 01:47.307
- Oh!
[door opens, closes]

01:47.407 --> 01:49.389
♪ Ain't no party like
a "Dunston Checks In" party ♪

01:49.489 --> 01:50.911
♪ 'Cause a "Dunston Checks In"
party don't stop ♪

01:51.011 --> 01:52.513
- You still have that?

01:52.613 --> 01:53.795
- Yeah, come on,
you can't get rid of this.

01:53.895 --> 01:55.718
It's Connor's
second favourite movie

01:55.818 --> 01:56.719
where a monkey wears clothes.

01:56.819 --> 01:57.720
- Wait, didn't you get
his text?

01:57.820 --> 01:59.643
He's bailing.

01:59.743 --> 02:01.125
- What?
- Yeah.

02:01.225 --> 02:03.648
- "Just want to stay in
and lay low tonight.

02:03.748 --> 02:05.650
Have fun, fam."
Wow.

02:05.750 --> 02:06.972
- You know, he puts up a front,

02:07.072 --> 02:08.374
but I think
he's really hurting.

02:08.474 --> 02:10.477
- Won't even leave the house.

02:11.878 --> 02:13.421
What if we went to him?

02:13.521 --> 02:16.144
- Well, we do have all the
ingredients for a great party--

02:16.244 --> 02:17.706
awesome siblings...
- Check.

02:17.806 --> 02:19.108
- "Dunston Checks In"...
- Check.

02:19.208 --> 02:21.671
- Soup. I made soup.

02:21.771 --> 02:23.554
- Party patrol, let's roll.

02:23.654 --> 02:25.476
- Whoo!
Let's roll.

02:25.576 --> 02:27.439
- Whoa, how much soup
did you make?

02:27.539 --> 02:28.841
- A lot.
I made too much soup.

02:28.941 --> 02:30.483
- Have you guys
made a decision?

02:30.583 --> 02:32.926
- No, why would they go
for that ranch house,

02:33.026 --> 02:35.609
when that gorgeous mid-century
is in their price range?

02:35.709 --> 02:37.051
- Seriously, can't they see

02:37.151 --> 02:38.733
you can just convert the garage
into an ADU?

02:38.833 --> 02:40.375
Make that income.

02:40.475 --> 02:43.459
- Have fun with your limited
counter space, you ding-dongs.

02:43.559 --> 02:45.863
- Should we open
another bottle?

02:45.963 --> 02:48.826
- Why are you saying that
like it's a question?

02:48.926 --> 02:50.909
- Mummy!
I heard her again.

02:51.009 --> 02:52.792
- Oh, it's okay, baby.

02:52.892 --> 02:54.474
- What's going on?

02:54.574 --> 02:57.157
- Oh, Camila thinks she's been
hearing a ghost in her room.

02:57.257 --> 02:58.920
Sometimes our brain
plays tricks on us

02:59.020 --> 03:00.682
when we're trying to go
to sleep, remember, sweetie?

03:00.782 --> 03:03.646
- But I actually heard her
this time.

03:03.746 --> 03:06.730
- You know, I had a ghost
in my house when I was little.

03:06.830 --> 03:09.613
- You did?
- No, she didn't.

03:09.713 --> 03:11.015
- No, I did.

03:11.115 --> 03:13.018
She would turn lights
on and off.

03:13.118 --> 03:14.660
She would move my toys.

03:14.760 --> 03:16.262
JoJo and I named her Moesha
because she was

03:16.362 --> 03:18.385
usually very active when
we were watching "Moesha."

03:18.485 --> 03:20.107
- What's "Moesha"?

03:20.207 --> 03:21.629
- Oh, we have a lot
to talk about.

03:21.729 --> 03:23.071
- Okay, it's time to go to bed,
okay, sweetie?

03:23.171 --> 03:24.673
- But I want
to hear about Moesha.

03:24.773 --> 03:25.915
- The ghost or the show?

03:26.015 --> 03:27.016
'Cause I can talk
about both for hours.

03:27.096 --> 03:29.098
- Like I said, bedtime.

03:31.862 --> 03:33.364
- [screams]
Surprise.

03:33.464 --> 03:35.046
- Surprise.
- Whoa.

03:35.146 --> 03:37.530
Ooh, yeah.
I'm definitely surprised.

03:37.630 --> 03:40.774
- You didn't want to go out,
so we decided to come to you.

03:40.874 --> 03:42.856
- Okay, move.
This soup is heavy.

03:42.956 --> 03:45.580
- Make room for fun.
- Okay.

03:45.680 --> 03:47.983
Um, hey, I-I told you guys

03:48.083 --> 03:49.185
I just wanted
to lay low tonight.

03:49.285 --> 03:51.027
I-I texted it.
It was in writing.

03:51.127 --> 03:52.189
- Well, with Gretchen
at her mum's,

03:52.289 --> 03:53.630
we thought you'd be lonely.

03:53.730 --> 03:56.754
- No, I'm fine.
Just didn't feel like hanging.

03:56.854 --> 03:58.196
- Oh, we can just do
a quiet night.

03:58.296 --> 04:00.159
Did you make cocktails?

04:00.259 --> 04:02.001
- Wait, have you been
smoking a cigar?

04:02.101 --> 04:03.603
[faint music playing]

04:03.703 --> 04:06.607
- Lupe. Yeah, she goes hard
on Saturday nights.

04:06.707 --> 04:08.249
- Where's that music
coming from?

04:08.349 --> 04:11.133
- Nothing, nowhere, nobody.

04:11.233 --> 04:15.058
[distant laughter]
- [laughing]

04:15.158 --> 04:18.062
Well, I mean, it's been nice
of you guys to cruise on by

04:18.162 --> 04:21.146
but, uh...
[yawns] Oh. Oh, man.

04:21.246 --> 04:23.549
- Okay, well,
we'll just take off.

04:23.649 --> 04:25.652
- We'll just leave.
- Okay.

04:27.294 --> 04:29.116
- Oh.
- Oh, hey!

04:29.216 --> 04:31.980
[laughter]

04:33.943 --> 04:35.945
- Sarah.
- Spags?

04:37.267 --> 04:40.030
- Is that split pea soup?
- Smoked lentil.

04:42.434 --> 04:44.576
- Hey, how's Camila doing?
- Honestly, not great.

04:44.676 --> 04:46.379
Why did you tell her
that ghost story?

04:46.479 --> 04:48.061
- Because it happened,
we had a ghost--

04:48.161 --> 04:49.663
Moesha Lansbury.

04:49.763 --> 04:51.145
The ghost also liked
"Murder, She Wrote."

04:51.245 --> 04:53.268
- Great, well, now Camila

04:53.368 --> 04:56.192
is even more scared
of something that isn't real.

04:56.292 --> 04:59.756
- I'm sorry, but how do
you know it's not real?

04:59.856 --> 05:02.640
- Oh, I don't know,
'cause of physics

05:02.740 --> 05:05.564
and biology and common sense.

05:05.664 --> 05:07.406
- Okay.

05:07.506 --> 05:09.329
I didn't want to say anything
because I know you

05:09.429 --> 05:11.772
don't believe in this stuff,
but I have been sensing

05:11.872 --> 05:14.215
a negative energy
in this space for a while.

05:14.315 --> 05:16.298
- Yeah, it's called Tom.

05:16.398 --> 05:18.300
- Who owned the house
before you bought it?

05:18.400 --> 05:20.743
- I don't know. I forget.
Uh, Janet something.

05:20.843 --> 05:23.026
It was a trust sale.
- A trust sale.

05:23.126 --> 05:24.548
Okay, that explains it.

05:24.648 --> 05:26.230
[whispering] Janet must've died
in this house.

05:26.330 --> 05:27.552
- [whispering]
She did die in this house,

05:27.652 --> 05:29.595
and that's why we bought it
for such a good price.

05:29.695 --> 05:31.357
[normal voice] Whoop, whoop!
- [normal voice] Marina.

05:31.457 --> 05:33.280
The restless spirit of Janet
is trapped in this house,

05:33.380 --> 05:36.524
and it is haunting your family.
- [gasps]

05:36.624 --> 05:38.626
[gasps, screams]

05:40.188 --> 05:41.731
- You lied to us so that
you could hang out

05:41.831 --> 05:43.533
with a bunch of rich guys.

05:43.633 --> 05:47.017
- Is that Mark Cuban in there?
- Yes, he's friends with Spags.

05:47.117 --> 05:48.820
- What?
- How is that possible?

05:48.920 --> 05:52.705
- I lied because I just want
to have a fun, dumb night

05:52.805 --> 05:54.307
with my fun, dumb friends

05:54.407 --> 05:56.189
where we don't have to talk
about my feelings.

05:56.289 --> 05:58.472
- I can be fun and dumb.
- No, you cannot, Sarah.

05:58.572 --> 05:59.834
All you try to do
is get me to talk

05:59.934 --> 06:01.196
and, Tom, all you do is talk.

06:01.296 --> 06:03.599
- What? I hate the sound
of my own voice.

06:03.699 --> 06:04.881
- Do you?
[cell phone chimes]

06:04.981 --> 06:06.923
- Tom sat pensively
on a park bench

06:07.023 --> 06:08.205
watching a red balloon
float by.

06:08.305 --> 06:10.928
Okay, that's for work.
- Sarah!

06:11.028 --> 06:12.691
I've been looking
all over for you.

06:12.791 --> 06:14.213
- I saw you, like,
one minute ago, Spags.

06:14.313 --> 06:15.975
- All right, bring it in.

06:16.075 --> 06:17.617
- No.
- All right.

06:17.717 --> 06:19.259
- Spags, haven't seen you
since the wedding.

06:19.359 --> 06:20.901
How's married life?

06:21.001 --> 06:24.466
- Oh, well, I wouldn't know,
as I am divorced.

06:24.566 --> 06:28.071
- Oh. [chuckles] Sorry.
That seems...quick.

06:28.171 --> 06:31.034
- Nah, it was, like, the
longest 11 months of my life,

06:31.134 --> 06:33.277
but, you know,
you can't tame this stallion.

06:33.377 --> 06:34.879
All right,
so what are we doing?

06:34.979 --> 06:36.642
Uh, we playing poker or what?

06:36.742 --> 06:39.285
- Oh, well, we would love to,
but we weren't exactly invited.

06:39.385 --> 06:41.248
- Specifically not invited.

06:41.348 --> 06:45.373
- Okay, well, I'm inviting you.

06:45.473 --> 06:46.855
I invited Mark Cuban.

06:46.955 --> 06:48.337
- Yeah, uh, quick question--

06:48.437 --> 06:49.859
how the hell did that happen?

06:49.959 --> 06:51.141
- Let's just say
when you're the inventor

06:51.241 --> 06:54.204
of Drawer D'Oeuvres,
it opens a lot of...

06:56.728 --> 06:58.871
Drawer doors.
- Yikes.

06:58.971 --> 07:00.633
- Well, they were
just leaving, so...

07:00.733 --> 07:03.477
- Oh, can Sarah stay?
Like, I'll pay for your buy-in.

07:03.577 --> 07:04.558
- Oh, that's so generous,

07:04.658 --> 07:05.800
but I can pay
for my own buy-in.

07:05.900 --> 07:06.921
- It's $800.

07:07.021 --> 07:09.044
- That would be great.
Thank you.

07:09.144 --> 07:12.328
- Let's play some poker!
- Let's play some...

07:12.428 --> 07:14.431
both: Poker!

07:15.792 --> 07:18.496
- Okay, you can stay...
- [laughs]

07:18.596 --> 07:20.739
- As long as you act
a little less you.

07:20.839 --> 07:22.141
- All right.
- Okay?

07:22.241 --> 07:23.903
That means do not ask me
about my breakup.

07:24.003 --> 07:26.266
Do not ask me about JoJo.
- Who's JoJo?

07:26.366 --> 07:27.508
- No correcting grammar.

07:27.608 --> 07:29.831
No lectures
on late-stage capitalism.

07:29.931 --> 07:32.074
No pushing your soup.
Just be bros.

07:32.174 --> 07:33.355
- I can be bro,

07:33.455 --> 07:34.917
although I don't like
that gendered term.

07:35.017 --> 07:36.439
- Sarah.

07:36.539 --> 07:38.522
- Let's drink some brewskis
and objectify women, dude.

07:38.622 --> 07:40.364
What?

07:40.464 --> 07:42.848
- Don't worry about me.
I can hang with the big boys.

07:42.948 --> 07:44.490
- Don't call them big boys.

07:44.590 --> 07:46.592
You guys are
already tanking this.

07:47.834 --> 07:50.137
- Aunt Denise,
is that house haunted?

07:50.237 --> 07:53.181
- Oh, no, sweetie.
That's a new construction.

07:53.281 --> 07:54.943
Those are rarely haunted...

07:55.043 --> 07:56.946
unless it's on
an ancient burial ground.

07:57.046 --> 07:59.269
- Denise, could you come
with me to the kitchen?

07:59.369 --> 08:01.912
We'll be right back, okay?

08:02.012 --> 08:04.716
- Wait, can you turn on
another light?

08:04.816 --> 08:06.939

Look, I'm never going
to believe in ghosts

17:20.817 --> 17:24.241
or haunted houses
or tarot crystals.

17:24.341 --> 17:27.125
- [laughs]
Tarot crystals do not exist.

17:27.225 --> 17:28.767
Oh, but should they?

17:28.867 --> 17:30.770
- I do like having
a best friend

17:30.870 --> 17:33.173
that sees the world
differently than I do.

17:33.273 --> 17:34.455
- And I like having
a best friend

17:34.555 --> 17:36.017
who questions everything.

17:36.117 --> 17:38.099
It's a nice challenge for me.

17:38.199 --> 17:40.983
But you have to admit--
you were spooked by Janet.

17:41.083 --> 17:44.387
- No, I was concerned
about an unexplained noise

17:44.487 --> 17:46.630
that was later explained.

17:46.730 --> 17:49.154
- No, you were scared
of a ghost.

17:49.254 --> 17:51.116
- I have never been
and will never be

17:51.216 --> 17:53.219
scared of a ghost.

17:54.941 --> 17:56.764
Denise, I know that was you.

17:56.864 --> 17:58.866
- That wasn't me.

18:01.069 --> 18:02.851
[gasps]

18:02.951 --> 18:05.975
- By the way, the rats may
have chewed through your wires.

18:06.075 --> 18:10.261
- You mean the bats?
- No, you also have rats.

18:10.361 --> 18:12.364
Bye.

18:14.486 --> 18:16.549
- Oh. [laughs]
- [growls]

18:16.649 --> 18:19.112
- Remember,
story comes from character,

18:19.212 --> 18:20.514
not the other way around.

18:20.614 --> 18:22.717
- I'll remember.
- All right.

18:22.817 --> 18:24.560
- Thanks for the soup.

18:24.660 --> 18:27.103
Later, Connor.
- Later, Mark Cuban.

18:29.666 --> 18:32.330
- Good guy.
He's a good guy.

18:32.430 --> 18:34.412
- Wait, so why did you bail
on the game?

18:34.512 --> 18:36.335
- Yeah, we were bro-ing out
with your bros

18:36.435 --> 18:38.177
just like you wanted--
we didn't talk about JoJo.

18:38.277 --> 18:39.579
We didn't talk
about your feelings once.

18:39.679 --> 18:41.061
- Yeah, because you talked

18:41.161 --> 18:42.943
about everybody else's
feelings.

18:43.043 --> 18:45.266
Now Terrence is dealing
with abandonment issues,

18:45.366 --> 18:48.471
and you made Mark Cuban
contemplate a career change.

18:48.571 --> 18:49.832
Mark Cuban!

18:49.932 --> 18:51.434
That's irresponsible, Tom.

18:51.534 --> 18:53.477
- Look, it's not my fault
that he's

18:53.577 --> 18:56.201
so deeply interested
in my process.

18:56.301 --> 18:57.803
- Everyone talking
about their feelings

18:57.903 --> 19:00.246
made me think
about my feelings.

19:00.346 --> 19:03.049
I just wanted one night
of distraction,

19:03.149 --> 19:05.232
and you guys took that from me.

19:08.156 --> 19:10.900
- I'm sorry, Con.
We--we blew it.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.462
We knew you wanted
a dumb night.

19:12.562 --> 19:14.624
- That's why we brought
a stupid movie like

19:14.724 --> 19:17.428
"Dunston Checks In", but we'll
give you your space, okay?

19:17.528 --> 19:19.431
We're sorry.

19:19.531 --> 19:22.294
- Wait, you brought
"Dunston Checks In"?

19:24.617 --> 19:26.520
It's my second favourite movie
where a monkey wears clothes.

19:26.620 --> 19:28.522
- We know.

19:28.622 --> 19:30.886
- There's that part
where Dunston swings

19:30.986 --> 19:33.849
from the chandelier and knocks
that lady into the cake.

19:33.949 --> 19:35.952
- Yeah.

19:36.633 --> 19:38.055
Dunston does that.

19:38.155 --> 19:40.778
[soft music]

19:40.878 --> 19:42.921
- I mean, I guess
it's still kind of early.

19:44.363 --> 19:46.426
[laughing]

19:46.526 --> 19:49.029
Dunston.

19:49.129 --> 19:52.514
[sighs] This is seriously dumb.
Thank you.

19:52.614 --> 19:54.276
- It's our pleasure.

19:54.376 --> 19:56.238
Remind me--what is
your favourite movie

19:56.338 --> 19:57.680
with a monkey
that wears clothes?

19:57.780 --> 19:59.563
- Some things are meant
to remain private, Tom.

19:59.663 --> 20:01.045
- Look at us--

20:01.145 --> 20:03.688
watching late-night movies,
just like old times.

20:03.788 --> 20:06.051
- Still gay, still married.

20:06.151 --> 20:08.695
- Right on.

20:08.795 --> 20:10.797
- [laughs, screeches]

20:11.919 --> 20:15.063
- It's game time.
Okay, next hand--

20:15.163 --> 20:17.025
Chicago high
with a Black Mariah.

20:17.125 --> 20:18.507
Let's double the ante, huh?

20:18.607 --> 20:20.430
- So 50 cents it is.

20:20.530 --> 20:23.674
- Mm, by the way, Lulu,
I won $1,500 last night.

20:23.774 --> 20:25.837
- Ooh, your horoscope
was right.

20:25.937 --> 20:28.280
- Nope, nothing to do
with that.

20:28.380 --> 20:29.882
By the way, the kids
are really quiet.

20:29.982 --> 20:31.084
Should we check on them?

20:31.184 --> 20:33.006
- Nah, Lupe's got them
under control.

20:33.106 --> 20:36.090
- Okay, I've got two queens.

20:36.190 --> 20:38.053
- Full house.
I win again.

20:38.153 --> 20:40.255
- You're bleeding us dry, Lupe.

20:40.355 --> 20:42.058
- You got to know
when to hold them,

20:42.158 --> 20:44.100
know when to fold them,

20:44.200 --> 20:45.262
and know when
to brush your teeth.

20:45.362 --> 20:48.066
Come on, it's bedtime.
[all groan]

20:48.166 --> 20:51.129
[jazzy flourish]
