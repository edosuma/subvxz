<i>Hence the bags you found

<i>Let's go in.</i>

<i>- Yeah?
- Yeah, it'll be fun.</i>

<i>- And you are? Hi, Sara.
- Sara, Deluxe Realty. Hi.</i>

31:11.244 --> 31:13.454
<i>Good, good.
Hey, listen, I'm, um...</i>

31:13.496 --> 31:16.249
<i>We're a, we're a small
boutique company.</i>

31:16.291 --> 31:18.001
<i>We're based
out of San Francisco.</i>

<i>We have extraordinarily
exclusive clientele.</i>

<i>It's all cash offers.</i>

31:22.338 --> 31:23.840
<i>That's all we deal with.</i>

31:23.840 --> 31:26.301
<i>I have somebody
very special with me today.</i>

31:26.342 --> 31:29.053
<i>Um, we drove by,
she said she had a gut feeling.</i>

31:29.095 --> 31:32.098
<i>And I will tell you, the last
time she had a gut feeling,</i>

31:32.140 --> 31:34.142
<i>it was a very big feeling.</i>

31:34.183 --> 31:36.477
<i>So, um, I'm just wondering,
is there any way</i>

31:36.561 --> 31:39.606
<i>you think we can sort of clear
things out just a little bit?</i>

31:39.606 --> 31:41.941
<i>Maybe get the lookie-loos
to kind of scram.</i>

31:42.025 --> 31:43.902
<i>I want her to have
a sense of the place.</i>

31:43.943 --> 31:46.362
<i>Really feel the space,
let her feel like it's hers</i>

31:46.446 --> 31:48.573
<i>for a little bit.
You think we could do that?</i>

31:48.615 --> 31:50.617
<i>And you said "all cash offer"?</i>

31:50.658 --> 31:53.286
<i>Well, that's exactly
what I said, Sara.</i>

31:53.328 --> 31:54.913
<i>- Give me one second.
- Okay.</i>

31:54.954 --> 31:58.249
<i>Excuse me, guys, I'm so sorry.
I have a private showing.</i>

31:59.959 --> 32:02.337
<i>Come here.</i>

32:04.297 --> 32:06.382
<i>What if the kids come in?</i>

33:19.580 --> 33:22.417
<i>So, what do you think?</i>

33:25.003 --> 33:27.505
<i>I think about what?</i>

33:28.131 --> 33:30.758
<i>Could you live here?</i>

33:31.759 --> 33:34.512
<i>I could live anywhere with you.</i>

33:46.816 --> 33:49.694
<i>How are we gonna do this, Bell?</i>

33:53.072 --> 33:55.366
<i>Together.</i>

<i>Got something for me?</i>

34:17.180 --> 34:18.389
<i>Here you go.</i>

34:18.473 --> 34:19.849
<i>- Appreciate you.
- No doubt.</i>

<i>Damn, you just gonna make me
work around you, huh?</i>

<i>Take up that whole
goddamn aisle, bruh.</i>

34:24.062 --> 34:26.814
<i>Yep, mm-hmm.</i>

34:32.236 --> 34:34.447
<i>Well, you're
a tough guy to get ahold of</i>

34:34.489 --> 34:36.240
<i>all of a sudden.</i>

34:37.867 --> 34:40.161
<i>I mean, do you listen
to your messages?</i>

34:40.203 --> 34:42.205
Do you read your texts?

34:42.205 --> 34:44.874
<i>I mean, you could've
called me back.</i>

34:45.458 --> 34:47.418
<i>- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.</i>

34:47.460 --> 34:49.295
<i>Did you know Colin's home?</i>

34:49.337 --> 34:51.047
<i>- I did.
- Yeah.</i>

34:51.047 --> 34:53.049
<i>You know, I didn't come here
to bust your balls.</i>

34:53.049 --> 34:54.467
Is that right?

34:54.467 --> 34:56.552
<i>- That's right.
- What'd you come here for?</i>

34:56.594 --> 35:00.556
<i>I came here to tell you
that we found Olga's murderer.</i>

35:00.598 --> 35:01.390
<i>Yeah.</i>

35:01.432 --> 35:03.643
<i>- Who?
- The guy called McGregor.</i>

35:03.643 --> 35:05.895
<i>He worked for Stratton,
he worked for Olga.</i>

35:05.895 --> 35:08.064
<i>He worked for everyone
but the fucking Easter Bunny.</i>

35:08.106 --> 35:12.235
<i>You know? I mean, Olga had a lot
of enemies before she died.</i>

35:12.276 --> 35:14.529
<i>Yeah.</i>

35:15.238 --> 35:17.031
<i>Hey.</i>

35:17.073 --> 35:19.117
<i>Guess we're done, huh?</i>

35:19.158 --> 35:20.993
<i>Thank you.</i>

35:21.077 --> 35:23.788
<i>Maybe we're done.</i>

35:24.997 --> 35:27.125
What do you, uh...

35:27.125 --> 35:28.793
<i>what do you mean, Detective?</i>

35:28.835 --> 35:31.796
<i>You know, I'm really good
at my job, Julian.</i>

35:31.796 --> 35:34.298
<i>And... this stuff</i>

35:34.382 --> 35:35.633
<i>with you...</i>

35:35.675 --> 35:37.552
<i>I wanted to figure it
all out for you, but...</i>

35:37.552 --> 35:40.596
You wanted to do it for me, huh?

35:40.638 --> 35:43.766
<i>Well, maybe for me, too.</i>

35:43.808 --> 35:44.851
<i>Yeah.</i>

35:44.892 --> 35:47.395
<i>You know, I feel
like I was set up, as well.</i>

35:47.395 --> 35:50.398
<i>I gave a lot
for this job, you know?</i>

35:51.190 --> 35:53.109
<i>Relationships that just...</i>

35:53.151 --> 35:54.527
<i>fell through my fingers.</i>

35:54.569 --> 35:56.612
<i>All because it couldn't match
that feeling</i>

35:56.654 --> 35:57.864
<i>when I closed a case.</i>

35:57.905 --> 35:59.657
<i>Well, here we are at the end,</i>

35:59.699 --> 36:01.325
<i>and I don't have that feeling.</i>

36:01.367 --> 36:03.286
<i>Yeah, there's motive.</i>

36:03.327 --> 36:04.328
<i>But...</i>

36:04.370 --> 36:07.039
<i>the way you were
in the middle of everything?</i>

36:07.498 --> 36:09.417
<i>That doesn't sound
like business.</i>

36:09.458 --> 36:11.419
<i>That sounds personal.</i>

36:11.460 --> 36:13.880
<i>What do you think about that?</i>

36:13.921 --> 36:16.007
<i>What do I think?</i>

36:16.048 --> 36:18.134
<i>I... I think I'm done.</i>

36:18.134 --> 36:20.344
Detective.

36:20.386 --> 36:22.638
<i>Think it's time
for me to move on.</i>

36:22.722 --> 36:24.056
<i>I get that.</i>

36:24.140 --> 36:25.808
<i>Do you?</i>

36:27.018 --> 36:29.687
<i>You know, Detective,
that "moving on"?</i>

36:29.687 --> 36:32.106
<i>Not so bad.</i>

36:36.611 --> 36:38.946
<i>I'll see you.</i>

<i>Hey!</i>

37:05.723 --> 37:07.475
Look who's home.

- Big hug.</i>

37:13.314 --> 37:15.233

- Oh, yeah.</i>

<i>How much do I have to pay?</i>

37:17.360 --> 37:18.778
<i>- Huh?
- How's it going?</i>

37:18.778 --> 37:20.863
<i>- Oh, no, no, no. No, no...
- No? What's wrong?</i>

37:20.905 --> 37:22.114
<i>- No.
- You don't want to hug me?</i>

37:22.198 --> 37:23.991
<i>- No, no, no! No!
- You don't want to hug your son?</i>

37:24.075 --> 37:25.618
<i>- Give me a hug.
- No! [laughing]</i>

<i>the beginning
of the rest of our lives.</i>

39:34.580 --> 39:36.957

<i>I admit it though.</i>

39:42.546 --> 39:46.092
<i>Not sure if timing was

<i>You know, they're finding
a way back to each other.</i>

40:36.475 --> 40:39.061
<i>And...</i>

40:39.103 --> 40:42.273
<i>I'm worried that if I leave...</i>

<i>All I did...</i>

46:49.431 --> 46:52.059
<i>was love him.</i>

47:17.251 --> 47:20.212
<i>I hold my head up
just enough</i>

47:20.254 --> 47:23.173
<i>To see the sky</i>

47:23.215 --> 47:25.926
<i>And when we go,
we won't go slow</i>

47:25.968 --> 47:28.512
<i>We'll put up such a fight</i>

47:28.554 --> 47:33.183
<i>When they fade
into the dust and into ash</i>

47:33.225 --> 47:36.353
<i>But all the children know</i>

47:36.395 --> 47:39.857
<i>For sure this pain
will surely pass</i>

47:39.857 --> 47:42.651
<i>Strong and wise</i>

47:42.651 --> 47:45.153
<i>And you are love</i>

47:45.195 --> 47:47.447
<i>And when the tide it comes</i>

47:47.489 --> 47:51.326

your head held high</i>

47:58.709 --> 48:02.796

48:21.440 --> 48:26.153
<i>I know that we'll be there,
little girl</i>

<i>You know, to carry on</i>

49:04.399 --> 49:06.401
<i>Keep fighting till the end</i>

49:06.443 --> 49:09.071
<i>And past the end
you will be strong...</i>

49:09.112 --> 49:10.572
You make women feel like

49:10.656 --> 49:14.326
<i>they are the eighth
fucking wonder of the world.</i>

49:14.993 --> 49:18.080
