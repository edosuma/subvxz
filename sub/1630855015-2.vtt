WEBVTT

00:08.638 --> 00:14.393
OK. Everything seems nailed down
for tomorrow. How you feeling?

00:14.393 --> 00:17.522
Why does everyone ask
how I'm feeling?

00:17.522 --> 00:20.650
I'm selling. My decision.
I'm feeling great.

00:20.650 --> 00:24.195
And yes, yes, axe that chopper.
I can fucking walk.

00:24.195 --> 00:25.906
Right, absolutely.

00:26.990 --> 00:28.867
- Office?
- ATN.

00:31.161 --> 00:32.120
Surprise visit?

00:36.917 --> 00:39.377
Happy Christmas,
you clock-watching fucks!

00:46.550 --> 00:49.930
That may be true, but NATO has
a cultural weight.

00:49.930 --> 00:52.557
So many olds.
Where are the hotties?

00:52.557 --> 00:55.184
This one needs the living shit
kicked out of it.

00:55.184 --> 00:58.230
A show about politics
called "Inside Baseball".

00:58.230 --> 01:00.273
- What?
- How fucking confusing is that?

01:00.273 --> 01:04.527
- They have that?
- Connor. "Have we left yet?"

01:04.527 --> 01:07.864
Eyeballs emoji, fingers crossed
emoji, and helicopter emoji.

01:07.864 --> 01:10.282
- We're coming.
- This is unbelievable.

01:10.282 --> 01:12.410
Our PGN is just going to crush this.

01:12.410 --> 01:14.244
Not quite yours yet.

01:14.621 --> 01:17.206
Business retreat, Tilly.
PGN brainstorm.

01:17.206 --> 01:19.291
Sunday, Monday programming, dookie.

01:19.291 --> 01:21.961
Tuesday, Wednesday programming, dookie.

01:21.961 --> 01:25.172
Friday, Saturday programming,
massive stinky dog dookie.

01:25.172 --> 01:27.592
I got to say, the upside is
huge if we just broaden out

01:27.592 --> 01:31.136
and stop over-indexing
to college professors. Right?

01:31.136 --> 01:33.055
Sorry, I just can't
seem to tear my eyes

01:33.055 --> 01:36.642
away from the bald man talking
about NATO. I have a boner.

01:36.642 --> 01:39.229
So a floaty kind of
semi-pitch would be

01:40.188 --> 01:43.357
hardcore international news
from global-global to hyper-local.

01:43.692 --> 01:45.150
Jess, would you watch that?

01:47.487 --> 01:50.864
Maybe a focus on Africa every day,
just what is happening in Africa.

01:50.864 --> 01:55.620
The Maghreb, Sub-Saharan East,
Sub-Saharan West, I would watch that.

01:55.620 --> 01:58.123
- You would not watch that shit.
- I would.

01:58.123 --> 02:00.500
That sounds like homework,
the show.

02:00.500 --> 02:02.042
The point is, it's global reach.

02:02.042 --> 02:04.379
It's a network that teaches you
how to watch it.

02:04.379 --> 02:09.467
Or shove all your farm report, melatonin
news hour info dumps in a daytime.

02:09.467 --> 02:12.094
Primetime, you go full
"Clockwork Orange", you know?

02:12.094 --> 02:13.430
Hey.

02:13.430 --> 02:16.892
Yeah, so unfortunately
Gretchen Young is conflicted out.

02:20.186 --> 02:21.938
Really?
With Tom?

02:22.522 --> 02:23.899
He went with Gretchen?

02:24.732 --> 02:27.067
OK, who's in second position?

02:27.067 --> 02:28.320
Crowley.

02:28.820 --> 02:30.654
OK, yeah, fine.

02:30.654 --> 02:34.116
I contacted his office.
He's also conflicted out.

02:38.120 --> 02:43.208
And Kohlmeyer, and Bulloch,
and Camden?

02:43.208 --> 02:46.295
Yeah, yeah, conflicted out.
It's weird.

02:46.963 --> 02:48.924
OK, great.
I'll call you back.

04:14.967 --> 04:17.177
SUCCESSION

04:24.476 --> 04:27.314
- So have we tied up all five now?
- Yep.

04:27.314 --> 04:29.524
And they're all the ones
that Mr. Roy's office gave us?

04:29.524 --> 04:30.941
Yep.

04:36.614 --> 04:39.992
- Hey, buddy!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

04:39.992 --> 04:41.453
So Logan's in.

04:41.453 --> 04:43.038
Logan's in?
What, upstairs?

04:43.038 --> 04:45.789
- In the sales meeting?
- No, he's on the floor, Tom.

04:45.789 --> 04:47.000
He's on the floor?

04:47.459 --> 04:50.712
Wait, explain to me exactly what
he's doing with his body and his face.

04:50.712 --> 04:55.717
I don't know. He's just moseying,
terrifyingly moseying.

04:56.216 --> 04:58.094
He's wearing sunglasses inside.

04:58.094 --> 05:01.096
It looks like if Santa Claus
was a hitman.

05:01.096 --> 05:04.183
OK. Hold on.
Hold steady. I'm coming in.

05:04.183 --> 05:08.688
Sergio, halt the car.
Cancel the rest of my afternoon.

05:15.737 --> 05:17.906
- Hey.
- Hey, Tom.

05:17.906 --> 05:20.033
So all the top attorneys
are conflicted out. Yeah?

05:20.033 --> 05:22.409
Dad teach you that?
It's a fucking nice move.

05:22.409 --> 05:25.871
- How does he want to marry you now?
- I'm not sure I know what you mean.

05:25.871 --> 05:27.498
Yeah, OK.

05:27.498 --> 05:30.001
So you've met with or retained
every usable divorce lawyer

05:30.001 --> 05:31.586
in New York just to fuck with me?

05:31.586 --> 05:34.631
I don't know, Shiv. I think
maybe Sarah made a mistake.

05:34.631 --> 05:37.259
You think I don't recognize my own
dad's playbook? Fuck you, Tom.

05:37.259 --> 05:39.301
Shiv, I did not intend
for this to be aggressive,

05:39.301 --> 05:41.303
but I've seen what your family
can do in these situations.

05:41.303 --> 05:44.515
And I want it to be amicable.
I'm sure we can figure it out.

05:44.515 --> 05:45.725
Yeah, OK.

05:45.725 --> 05:47.269
You want to be
my dad's little bitch boy?

05:47.269 --> 05:49.019
Why don't you deliver
him a message, bitch boy?

05:49.019 --> 05:51.982
Tell him to fuck off
and stay out of my life!

05:56.694 --> 05:58.822
Hey. What's happening?

05:58.822 --> 06:01.241
So he's still just
kind of walking around,

06:01.241 --> 06:04.326
but with a slight sense
that he might kill someone.

06:04.995 --> 06:06.371
It's like "Jaws".

06:06.955 --> 06:10.041
If everyone in "Jaws" worked for Jaws.

06:11.001 --> 06:14.462
- Yeah.
- So he did one big shout.

06:15.171 --> 06:18.425
He does not like the
countdown to election chyrons.

06:18.425 --> 06:21.927
He hates the new font.
It's too small. It's too ingratiating.

06:21.927 --> 06:24.722
It's a really bad vibe.
What is this, do you think?

06:24.722 --> 06:28.476
Maybe he just wants to play
your sex tape on late night, Craig.

06:30.020 --> 06:33.272
No, the future starts now, Craig.

06:33.272 --> 06:36.191
Once the board rubber stamps,

06:36.191 --> 06:39.154
and once the regulators nod
the deal through three, four months,

06:39.154 --> 06:41.655
Waystar is gone,
this will be home.

06:42.323 --> 06:44.742
So he's going to be here
all the time in person?

06:44.742 --> 06:48.370
Yep. Hanging around,
like the threat of a nuclear war.

06:48.370 --> 06:50.331
Here we go. Hey.

06:50.331 --> 06:52.416
Hey, sir, Mr. Boss Man.

06:58.048 --> 06:59.883
One email.

07:01.800 --> 07:03.929
Fucking stakhanovites in here.

07:06.180 --> 07:08.641
Please, don't exhaust yourself.

07:11.185 --> 07:13.979
What do you think
of the election refit?

07:14.731 --> 07:17.566
Yeah, pretty fucking penny.
It's an aircraft hangar.

07:18.526 --> 07:19.777
What's the air con bill?

07:19.777 --> 07:23.447
Cyd really loves the sense of space.
Certainly interesting.

07:24.199 --> 07:25.324
Where is she?

07:25.324 --> 07:28.995
Cyd, she doesn't tend to stay late
when it's opera season.

07:28.995 --> 07:31.830
- Hey, Cyd.
- Boss, I didn't see you.

07:31.830 --> 07:33.166
I was busy.

07:33.166 --> 07:36.794
But I can see that my social
secretary's been looking after you.

07:36.794 --> 07:39.256
- Have you watched the tape?
- Tom?

07:41.298 --> 07:43.426
Kerry's tape.
Have you watched it?

07:43.426 --> 07:44.844
What do you think?

07:45.512 --> 07:46.721
Of Kerry?

07:47.055 --> 07:49.640
What do I think of her
audition to be an anchor?

07:50.099 --> 07:51.309
Yes.

07:53.143 --> 07:57.148
- What do you think, Logan?
- No, no, no.

07:58.525 --> 07:59.733
You go first.

08:00.485 --> 08:04.531
Well, I think I liked it.

08:05.240 --> 08:07.700
- I mean, she's got something.
- She really does.

08:08.784 --> 08:12.414
Yeah, should we think
of giving her a slot?

08:12.414 --> 08:17.001
Because I personally think that
that could be a very interesting idea.

08:17.001 --> 08:19.545
I'm keeping out.
She's my assistant.

08:19.545 --> 08:23.675
It would be very unprofessional
of me to get involved.

08:26.051 --> 08:28.554
Whatever you two geniuses think.

08:29.097 --> 08:31.348
Now, I want to talk to them.

08:31.348 --> 08:34.018
A little speech, somewhere
down here in the middle.

08:34.686 --> 08:35.978
Man of the people.

08:40.733 --> 08:44.695
Good evening. I'm Kerry Castellabate
and these are our top stories.

08:44.695 --> 08:47.114
You've been great so far.
You look stupid.

08:47.114 --> 08:52.621
Missouri State police... Missouri
State police have issued an Amber alert,

08:52.621 --> 08:55.080
as two children are believed
to have been abducted.

08:55.080 --> 08:57.041
They were last seen
outside the school gates,

08:57.041 --> 08:58.668
waiting for their mother to call in.

08:58.668 --> 09:00.337
And then sudden smile.

09:00.337 --> 09:02.796
Must act natural
to fool the humans.

09:02.796 --> 09:06.050
And a new medical study
has found that drinking...

09:06.050 --> 09:07.761
She is doing the shit
out of these news.

09:09.678 --> 09:11.723
Man, dad was a God.

09:12.515 --> 09:15.184
Tomorrow, he's selling
the empire to a 4Chan Swede

09:15.184 --> 09:17.353
and dishing out jobs for blowies.

09:17.353 --> 09:20.190
Hey, Sandy. Hi.

09:21.483 --> 09:22.983
I hope you don't mind.

09:22.983 --> 09:24.777
I was going to try
and send something,

09:24.777 --> 09:27.029
but I thought I'd just call
because it's kind of urgent.

09:27.029 --> 09:29.407
- Hope that's OK.
- Yeah, no, of course.

09:29.907 --> 09:32.160
What's up?
Is it about Connor's wedding?

09:32.160 --> 09:35.245
Because that was
such a regrettable note.

09:35.245 --> 09:37.916
No. This is completely different.

09:37.916 --> 09:40.877
It's just about our chat.
And your pitch.

09:40.877 --> 09:43.630
I was just thinking
maybe I was a little hasty.

09:46.007 --> 09:47.050
Yeah.

09:47.050 --> 09:51.596
And do your siblings
feel the same or still no?

09:51.596 --> 09:54.849
Well, no. I haven't had a chance
to talk to them about it yet,

09:54.849 --> 09:57.101
but I'm going to bounce it
around, see if I can persuade them.

09:57.101 --> 09:58.686
Because, you know, I agree.

09:58.686 --> 10:00.896
There's a lot of upside there
to get a little more money.

10:00.896 --> 10:02.649
Well, I mean, obviously, I agree.

10:02.649 --> 10:05.192
But the board meeting
is tomorrow, Shiv.

10:05.192 --> 10:06.945
Well, look,

10:06.945 --> 10:10.615
can I put you on alert just in case
there is room for discussion there?

10:10.615 --> 10:13.534
And just to say that
this is a live issue for me.

10:13.534 --> 10:17.705
You know, maybe
we don't just wave this through.

10:17.705 --> 10:22.001
Maybe it pisses off my dad,
but maybe that's OK. Yeah?

10:22.001 --> 10:24.421
- Yeah, absolutely.
- Maybe we can circle back.

10:24.421 --> 10:26.213
Is that OK, Sandy?

10:27.048 --> 10:30.552
- So good.
- Again, again, again.

10:30.552 --> 10:32.553
What? Cheeky.

10:32.553 --> 10:35.055
- One more.
- Again?

10:35.055 --> 10:38.309
One more.
Press the button. One more.

10:38.309 --> 10:40.979
If he put this on air,
this is, like, easily packaged

10:40.979 --> 10:43.814
as symptomatic of total
loss of judgment and control.

10:43.814 --> 10:46.400
- Guys...
- Yeah, I know.

10:46.400 --> 10:49.653
Transpo's on the tarmac. It's waiting
to take you to Connors rehearsal.

10:49.653 --> 10:52.906
- He's texting me.
- This is special.

10:55.909 --> 10:59.830
I prefer something
a little more stable.

10:59.830 --> 11:02.541
Yeah, that's only
for a song and dance.

11:02.541 --> 11:04.793
Let's keep it cheap and cheerful. Tom.

11:05.169 --> 11:08.005
- Yeah?
- Can you do a little intro for me?

11:08.005 --> 11:09.633
Sprinkle a little sugar?

11:09.633 --> 11:11.343
- Up there?
- Yeah.

11:11.343 --> 11:12.802
Of course.

11:12.802 --> 11:14.888
Yeah. Sure.

11:16.472 --> 11:18.141
OK.

11:18.141 --> 11:20.185
Hey, guys.
Hey. Hi.

11:21.019 --> 11:22.312
Just wanted to say hi.

11:24.356 --> 11:27.025
Come on over.
Yeah, it's been a tough few weeks.

11:27.776 --> 11:31.279
Election coming into view.
I appreciate you all.

11:31.279 --> 11:33.406
And Cyd, my partner in crime.

11:34.824 --> 11:38.995
And from my POV, you know, keep
cranking, because we're doing great.

11:39.578 --> 11:42.957
Up 3% in the demo,
week over week.

11:44.042 --> 11:47.963
But we can do more.
Up 15% year over year.

11:50.130 --> 11:51.466
It's great work.

11:51.466 --> 11:55.469
And just real pleasure to have the
big man here to give us some support.

11:55.469 --> 11:57.764
So, sir, up you come.

12:00.642 --> 12:03.018
Come on up.
I'll help.

12:06.982 --> 12:08.858
I could give you a kiss from here.

12:13.862 --> 12:16.824
Good afternoon, everybody.
Good afternoon.

12:17.241 --> 12:19.702
15% up year on year.

12:20.869 --> 12:24.790
It's a shame we're up 40 on costs.

12:24.790 --> 12:29.004
But I guess, it evens itself out
in the end. I mean, does it?

12:30.839 --> 12:33.132
Is 15 equal to 40, pal?

12:35.759 --> 12:38.430
Is 15 equal to 40, pal?

12:40.556 --> 12:41.724
- No.
- No!

12:42.391 --> 12:44.727
Good!
Good head for numbers.

12:45.854 --> 12:48.481
All right. You're good folks.

12:48.481 --> 12:51.693
You're the best.
Or you wouldn't be in here.

12:52.652 --> 12:56.531
But you've got to knuckle down for me.

12:57.364 --> 13:00.994
Waystar, I can't say too much as yet.

13:01.660 --> 13:05.456
But I'm going to be spending
a lot more time in here with you lot.

13:06.166 --> 13:10.754
Because I love it in here.
I fucking love it!

13:18.135 --> 13:23.934
So I don't want to know
about 3% week on week.

13:24.559 --> 13:27.519
I want to know that we are killing
the opposition.

13:28.063 --> 13:30.148
I want to be cutting their throats.

13:30.898 --> 13:35.403
Our rivals should be checking
in up back of their chauffeured cars

13:35.403 --> 13:38.989
because they can't believe
what we did.

13:39.783 --> 13:42.993
So fucking spicy.
So true.

13:43.494 --> 13:46.413
Something everyone knows.

13:46.957 --> 13:53.921
But nobody says because
they're too fucking lily-livered.

13:55.923 --> 14:01.387
They cannot believe what we said
and the fact that we fucking said it.

14:02.054 --> 14:05.391
They're fucking jam spheres
on the highway.

14:05.391 --> 14:11.898
Now, anyone who believes
that I'm getting out,

14:11.898 --> 14:14.566
please shove the bunting up your ass.

14:17.487 --> 14:18.946
This is not the end.

14:19.989 --> 14:21.824
I'm going to build something better.

14:22.701 --> 14:26.621
Something faster, lighter,
meaner, wilder.

14:26.621 --> 14:30.958
And I'm going to do it
from in here with you lot.

14:31.960 --> 14:34.170
You're fucking pirates!

14:57.526 --> 15:01.114
Who are you most excited about never
having to see again once GoJo closes?

15:01.114 --> 15:04.825
Hugo, Greg, Karl.
What about you?

15:05.327 --> 15:07.662
Hey, no, no, no.
We can't get on.

15:08.079 --> 15:11.583
- I don't know. There's a problem.
- Excuse me, what?

15:11.583 --> 15:13.584
I don't know what this is.

15:13.584 --> 15:16.962
But apparently, I'm not
authorized to let you take off.

15:16.962 --> 15:18.882
- Who is?
- The company has just sent word.

15:18.882 --> 15:21.800
We are the company.
Our dad is the CEO.

15:24.846 --> 15:26.431
What?

15:27.264 --> 15:29.059
- What?
- It's dad.

15:30.392 --> 15:31.727
He's fucking with us.

15:32.353 --> 15:34.898
Right? He knows
we're out here making moves.

15:35.649 --> 15:37.066
His feathers are ruffled.

15:37.066 --> 15:39.486
So we're just going to get on,
and we're going to figure it out later.

15:39.486 --> 15:41.571
- And we'll just figure it out.
- I'm really sorry.

15:41.571 --> 15:44.073
- I'm not able to let you board.
- We have somewhere to be.

15:44.073 --> 15:46.076
And if we're not, I'm going
to set aside

15:46.076 --> 15:48.661
several hundred thousand dollars,
and I'm going to dedicate it

15:48.661 --> 15:50.247
to destroying your life.
Is that great?

15:50.247 --> 15:52.581
- How does that sound?
- I can't speak to that.

15:52.581 --> 15:56.961
Here it goes! OK.
Bye bye.

15:56.961 --> 15:59.880
- Where's it going?
- Here goes daddy.

15:59.880 --> 16:02.216
- It's going back to the city.
- Bye bye, birdy.

16:03.384 --> 16:04.802
There it is.

16:07.263 --> 16:09.473
- Wave bye to daddy.
- What the fuck is this?

16:09.473 --> 16:11.685
We're going to be late now.
Connor's going to shit.

16:11.685 --> 16:14.813
It's going to be a guilt trip
to the fucking moon. God damn it.

16:14.813 --> 16:18.482
In Buddhism, sometimes your
greatest tormentor can also be

16:18.482 --> 16:20.527
your most perceptive teacher.

16:20.527 --> 16:21.777
That's really wise.

16:21.777 --> 16:24.573
Hey, Buddha.
Nice Tom Fords.

16:26.824 --> 16:28.326
- OK, this is interesting.
- Is it Con?

16:28.326 --> 16:31.370
- No.
- Where's the car?

16:31.370 --> 16:34.248
Sandy and Stewy.
They want to meet.

16:34.248 --> 16:37.001
Call or meet.
They prefer the meet.

16:37.001 --> 16:40.004
They're asking if we're going to be
back in the city in the next one to two.

16:40.004 --> 16:41.589
I mean, tonight?

16:41.589 --> 16:43.799
No. It's about the board shit, right?

16:43.799 --> 16:45.884
Like, Stewy says that Sandy
thinks that there's more juice

16:45.884 --> 16:48.179
to squeeze from the Swede,
so they're just flying that again?

16:48.179 --> 16:50.348
It's bullshit, Shiv.
We've moved on.

16:50.348 --> 16:52.183
- I agree with this.
- Hey, where's the car?

16:52.183 --> 16:53.684
They just left.

16:55.478 --> 16:57.647
- Get a car.
- I'm trying.

16:58.397 --> 17:01.483
Nothing from the board.
I don't like this silence.

17:01.483 --> 17:03.820
Give it one last buzz round.

17:03.820 --> 17:08.532
Kerry, get Frank and Karl
onto the independents.

17:08.532 --> 17:10.577
Let's triple lock this down.

17:19.209 --> 17:21.837
- Hey.
- Hi. We finished early, so...

17:23.882 --> 17:25.257
What's going on?

17:26.051 --> 17:29.846
Sorry?
Just some prep for post-board meet.

17:29.846 --> 17:31.556
The signing of the deal.

17:31.556 --> 17:35.185
It seems Matsson would love
an actual photo op.

17:35.185 --> 17:37.603
I guess the question is,
is that something you would like,

17:37.603 --> 17:38.812
or should we just...

17:38.812 --> 17:41.231
- What were you laughing at?
- What?

17:41.231 --> 17:42.651
What were you laughing at?

17:42.651 --> 17:47.404
Gerri was... We were chatting,
and she said something amusing.

17:48.365 --> 17:50.617
Let's look at the options.

17:51.451 --> 17:57.207
Look, I don't know if I should
be seen shaking Matsson's hand.

17:57.207 --> 17:59.834
I mean, he's been such
a prick about the spinoff.

17:59.834 --> 18:03.629
Karolina, can you do the option deck?

18:04.965 --> 18:06.633
Well, you're ready to go in.

18:07.007 --> 18:10.594
- But can you do it?
- Is your laptop not working?

18:10.594 --> 18:13.306
- Nope.
- Just give it a go.

18:16.308 --> 18:18.686
It appears to be working.
Give it a go.

18:18.686 --> 18:20.188
OK.

18:20.813 --> 18:23.899
See if it works.

18:29.405 --> 18:30.906
Severe storm...

18:31.366 --> 18:34.368
So here's the deck.
We got some great stuff here.

18:37.246 --> 18:39.039
So, should we get into it?

18:39.039 --> 18:42.877
Look, I don't want to be seen like
some piece of fucking set dressing.

18:43.837 --> 18:46.965
The only thing is, everyone's
saying the timing,

18:46.965 --> 18:48.716
the deal you've done...

18:48.716 --> 18:50.844
Don't you want your moment
in the sun?

18:50.844 --> 18:53.929
You working for Matsson already?
I'm still here, you know.

18:53.929 --> 18:55.180
I haven't gone.

18:56.349 --> 18:59.269
You getting your Viking hat on early?

18:59.935 --> 19:02.564
- No.
- Nah, this is bullshit.

19:03.272 --> 19:05.775
Hugo, I think we might need someone

19:05.775 --> 19:08.444
to go and suck off
an independent director.

19:08.444 --> 19:11.864
I'm concerned about the board.
Put your fucking lipstick on.

19:21.540 --> 19:23.125
Is it worse to go up now?

19:23.125 --> 19:25.629
I would love to not go,
but I think we kind of have to drink

19:25.629 --> 19:29.089
at least a couple of Martini Passive
Aggressos just to make up, right?

19:29.089 --> 19:32.509
Come on, come on.
Flat rates.

19:32.886 --> 19:35.054
- Give you a good price.
- OK, what is this?

19:35.054 --> 19:37.222
- We're kind of pushed.
- Is this a fucking ambush?

19:37.222 --> 19:39.851
We just wanted to do five in person.
Right, Sandy?

19:39.851 --> 19:42.187
We have a suite
booked across the way.

19:42.187 --> 19:44.564
Well, guys, it's not exactly convenient.

19:44.564 --> 19:47.274
We're prepared to vote no
on the GoJo deal

19:47.274 --> 19:49.527
at the Waystar board meeting tomorrow.

19:49.527 --> 19:52.488
We think there's more money
to be squeezed from the Swede,

19:52.488 --> 19:56.158
and we think you're rushing this
for emotional reasons.

19:56.158 --> 19:57.911
Well, I don't think so.
OK, see you.

19:57.911 --> 20:01.081
The premiums look weak
on market comparables.

20:01.081 --> 20:02.832
You know it.
Look at last week, Ro.

20:02.832 --> 20:04.249
It's a different deal.
It's not relevant.

20:04.249 --> 20:08.128
We want your dad to ask for more,
but he stopped engaging.

20:08.128 --> 20:10.798
- He's palmed us off with Karl.
- He does that.

20:10.798 --> 20:12.299
He can get the deal through
without us,

20:12.299 --> 20:15.261
but if we can get you guys
on our side,

20:15.261 --> 20:18.265
we can force them back
into the ring for one last round.

20:19.390 --> 20:24.395
OK, so I guess like board pushes
back on price, what's the big deal?

20:24.895 --> 20:27.857
We'd have to weigh that against
the risk of blowing everything up.

20:27.857 --> 20:31.068
I think our position might be that
we're just done cornholing our dad.

20:31.068 --> 20:33.822
But we just feel like your old man
got hot for this.

20:33.822 --> 20:36.783
- Can't we cool him off?
- Listen, listen.

20:36.783 --> 20:40.120
There's money for all of us
if we ask nicely.

20:40.120 --> 20:43.039
We push too hard, danger, danger.
But yeah, it's there.

20:43.039 --> 20:44.499
You know it's there.

20:45.249 --> 20:47.751
My dad is clear.
He wants to vote no.

20:47.751 --> 20:50.797
Us plus you guys, that's it.
He's outvoted.

20:50.797 --> 20:53.675
This doesn't get through the board.
Send him back to the table.

20:53.675 --> 20:55.176
It doesn't need to go nuclear.

20:55.176 --> 20:58.804
OK, it's not a big deal.
We'll think about it.

20:58.804 --> 21:00.515
Well, the board meeting's tomorrow,

21:00.515 --> 21:03.059
so we need to know
in the next hour or two.

21:03.059 --> 21:04.184
OK.

21:04.184 --> 21:06.604
Sure, so it's either we vote yes tomorrow

21:06.604 --> 21:09.148
and we all make billions of dollars,
or we sign up for your cool shit,

21:09.148 --> 21:12.276
and then dad disinherits us entirely.
That sounds like a toughie.

21:12.276 --> 21:13.987
We'll think about it.
Thanks. Bye.

21:13.987 --> 21:15.237
- Yeah, we gotta go.
- Ken.

21:15.614 --> 21:17.239
- We're done.
- Ken!

21:17.699 --> 21:20.744
- I'll keep working.
- Yeah, and I'll call Ken.

21:23.203 --> 21:24.706
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:25.957 --> 21:28.417
- You're here now, huh?
- Yeah, no, sorry.

21:28.417 --> 21:30.294
Are you leaving or are you OK?

21:30.294 --> 21:34.423
Yeah, yeah, I'm just...
I'm just going for a little drink.

21:34.423 --> 21:37.010
- It's over?
- The rehearsal?

21:37.010 --> 21:38.677
- Yeah.
- No, no.

21:38.677 --> 21:42.891
But I think they can take it from here.
Not vital from here.

21:42.891 --> 21:45.476
Yeah. I mean, the bride is
normally, I guess,

21:45.476 --> 21:49.147
generally considered one of the first
team in the wedding, you know?

21:49.147 --> 21:51.316
Yeah, right.

21:51.316 --> 21:56.904
Yeah, I should go and have a think.
I'm in a bit of a fuzz.

21:56.904 --> 22:00.200
Everything feels very vivid today,
doesn't it?

22:01.201 --> 22:03.787
You OK? What?

22:04.621 --> 22:06.373
- Yeah, fine.
- What's going on?

22:06.373 --> 22:10.125
You can't be jumping for joy
the whole time, right?

22:10.125 --> 22:11.752
No, I guess.

22:11.752 --> 22:14.922
- Look, I should go.
- Yeah, OK.

22:15.381 --> 22:17.716
- Yeah, bye.
- OK, bye.

22:20.762 --> 22:23.056
- Fairytale wedding.
- There goes the bride.

22:24.099 --> 22:25.725
I have enough cash.
I'll take her.

22:25.725 --> 22:28.353
Do we even go up?
It seems like it's over.

22:28.353 --> 22:31.189
I mean, yeah, I think we should.

22:31.189 --> 22:32.941
What do you mean?
Yeah, of course.

22:32.941 --> 22:35.693
We have a lot to discuss.

22:35.693 --> 22:39.321
What, the fucking bullshit? No.
Come on.

22:39.905 --> 22:42.032
Roman, look, a few weeks'
pain could really set us up.

22:42.032 --> 22:44.703
And I think we over-promised
on Pierce, and...

22:44.703 --> 22:47.204
- It's a Sandy mind game.
- We got to go.

22:47.746 --> 22:50.040
- Fuck them. Fuck those guys.
- Sure.

22:56.380 --> 22:58.049
- Finally.
- Found him.

22:58.800 --> 23:01.094
- Finally.
- Hey, hey, hey.

23:01.094 --> 23:02.971
- Here they are.
- Hello, sir.

23:02.971 --> 23:04.806
- We're so sorry.
- Hugsie.

23:04.806 --> 23:07.601
Dad screwed us. Hey, bro.

23:07.601 --> 23:10.185
Look at you.
The Rebel Alliance.

23:11.813 --> 23:15.692
How is it out in those hills?
Supply lines OK?

23:15.692 --> 23:18.944
Got enough to eat?
This is how it is, huh?

23:19.486 --> 23:22.906
The Battle Royale, me and Dad
on one side, you guys on the other?

23:23.407 --> 23:26.369
You OK, man?
We bumped into Willa on the way in.

23:27.704 --> 23:29.289
Yeah, I think it's all fine.

23:30.832 --> 23:32.125
Yeah.

23:34.210 --> 23:39.674
Willa stood up to do her speech,
and she said, I can't do this.

23:41.343 --> 23:45.764
And she went to the bathroom for
40 minutes with her so-called friends.

23:48.099 --> 23:50.809
No, no, no.
That is not... You're fine.

23:50.809 --> 23:52.979
That's totally fine.
Don't worry about that.

23:52.979 --> 23:55.065
Just toss her another 10 grand.

23:55.065 --> 23:57.984
Or a snowmobile and
some teeth-whiting vouchers.

23:57.984 --> 23:59.693
Any luck, Sylvia?

24:02.197 --> 24:03.614
Willa's mom.

24:04.657 --> 24:05.866
It's fine.

24:06.618 --> 24:10.205
- This is so fucking weird.
- Do we regroup at my place?

24:10.205 --> 24:14.125
Shiv... He's looking a little rough.
Don't you think?

24:14.125 --> 24:15.334
Well, sure.

24:15.334 --> 24:17.711
I'm sorry that dad fucked us,
and I'm sorry that we're late.

24:17.711 --> 24:21.216
- But we do need to decide fast.
- I think we know, right?

24:21.216 --> 24:22.509
- Do we, though?
- Yeah.

24:22.509 --> 24:24.052
They made some pretty compelling arguments.

24:24.052 --> 24:25.469
Sandy's a greedy little bitch.

24:25.469 --> 24:27.889
She's got her hand up the ass
of the carcass of her dad,

24:27.889 --> 24:30.016
and Stewy's just come along
for the ride.

24:30.016 --> 24:31.684
It's a packet of horseshit.

24:31.684 --> 24:33.811
OK.
What if I want to talk it through?

24:33.811 --> 24:36.356
I just think I think we rise above it, Shiv.

24:36.356 --> 24:39.484
Maybe Dad is not on it
like he used to be,

24:39.484 --> 24:41.318
and maybe he's underplayed his hand.

24:41.318 --> 24:43.280
And the board
are all hand-fucking-picked

24:43.280 --> 24:45.322
bunch of Japanese plastic cats
just waving it through.

24:46.532 --> 24:49.660
Still incommunicado.
I just really hope she's OK.

24:50.370 --> 24:54.873
So what do you say?
A little bit of karaoke?

24:56.542 --> 24:59.296
Or would it be
possible to do anything

24:59.296 --> 25:01.089
other than that in
the entire universe?

25:01.422 --> 25:03.341
She's partying. I can party.

25:04.633 --> 25:07.053
We can go drink, right?

25:07.053 --> 25:10.432
A little bachelor party
for POTUS SCROTUS.

25:11.557 --> 25:14.311
Well, I mean,
we three kind of...

25:14.311 --> 25:18.939
- Sure. Everybody's busy.
- Come on, let's give him a drink.

25:19.316 --> 25:23.360
Yeah.
But not your usual stupid places.

25:24.029 --> 25:29.074
Somewhere fun and real,
away from the fancy dance.

25:29.074 --> 25:31.077
A real bar with chicks

25:31.077 --> 25:33.872
and guys who work with their hands
in grease

25:33.872 --> 25:37.083
and sweat from their hands
and have blood in their hair.

25:37.083 --> 25:38.293
I don't like these guys.

25:38.293 --> 25:40.962
They sound like a medical
experiment gone wrong.

25:41.421 --> 25:44.299
I don't know. He just said
it's a big fucking problem.

25:44.299 --> 25:47.635
Well, why the kitchen?
Should we hide the knives?

25:47.635 --> 25:49.386
I don't know.
He just said...

25:50.137 --> 25:51.972
Hey, Log!
What's up?

25:51.972 --> 25:57.478
It's all this pizza.
Why am I looking at all this pizza?

25:58.104 --> 25:59.439
It's killing me.

25:59.773 --> 26:03.025
- It's out of control, Tom.
- Right.

26:03.025 --> 26:06.070
They send out for fresh pies, and
there are two or three here already.

26:06.070 --> 26:07.363
They're perfectly good.

26:07.363 --> 26:09.531
All you have to do is put them
in the fucking microwave.

26:09.531 --> 26:10.867
Noted.

26:10.867 --> 26:15.664
I guess, just to say,
there's a sog factor.

26:15.664 --> 26:17.081
Greg, fuck off.

26:18.208 --> 26:19.333
OK.

26:25.965 --> 26:27.508
It's not the pizza.

26:28.300 --> 26:32.097
I've been thinking about Kerry.

26:33.222 --> 26:36.184
OK. Yeah, very excited.

26:36.184 --> 26:40.313
I mean, let's get into it.
She's a natural.

26:40.313 --> 26:41.522
She's got it.

26:43.984 --> 26:45.819
Is she the finished article?

26:46.319 --> 26:51.490
Well, finished article, no.

26:51.490 --> 26:53.075
But you wouldn't expect her to be.

26:53.075 --> 26:56.203
- No.
- She needs a little time.

26:59.290 --> 27:01.125
Maybe quite a bit of time.

27:02.210 --> 27:05.004
- Interesting.
- Yeah, she's raw.

27:05.004 --> 27:11.344
And I think maybe we should think
about starting her way under the radar.

27:11.344 --> 27:16.223
And she has a lot to learn, a lot.

27:16.933 --> 27:21.855
I think it can be damaging to put
talent out there too early.

27:21.855 --> 27:24.733
Smart.
That's smart.

27:29.486 --> 27:32.656
Yeah, OK. Sure.
No problem.

27:32.656 --> 27:34.034
I'm not involved.

27:34.659 --> 27:38.621
I'm nowhere near this.
I know nothing.

27:39.163 --> 27:40.874
Sure. Understood.

27:45.587 --> 27:47.130
- America.
- This is charming.

27:47.130 --> 27:49.758
- Missed you.
- What's everybody having?

27:49.758 --> 27:51.009
What do you want?

27:51.343 --> 27:53.303
Do you think they know
how to make a vodka tonic?

27:53.303 --> 27:55.388
House ranch? Do I dare?

27:55.388 --> 27:57.431
- No.
- Get that.

27:57.431 --> 28:01.602
Just a club soda with a sealed lid.
Nothing from that tainted nozzle.

28:01.602 --> 28:02.937
Con, what do you want?

28:02.937 --> 28:04.856
I'll just have whatever
a regular Joe would have.

28:04.856 --> 28:08.317
Just Belgian Weiss beer.
Not Hoegaarden, thank you.

28:08.317 --> 28:10.278
Have you seen this?
Word on the street

28:10.278 --> 28:13.822
about what the Waystar price
will come out at... Sandy shared it.

28:13.822 --> 28:18.620
- Can I get a vodka tonic?
- You still with us, Con?

28:18.620 --> 28:20.621
Sure. Just Willa.

28:21.039 --> 28:22.706
I have her location shared.

28:25.042 --> 28:27.586
- I just think it's a factory setting.
- It's not.

28:27.586 --> 28:31.257
Anyway, I am reassured she's
definitely not on her way to Cuba.

28:31.257 --> 28:32.800
Will, her phone isn't.

28:33.718 --> 28:36.388
She stopped moving.
I guess she found a spot she likes.

28:36.388 --> 28:38.265
- Sure.
- On another man's dick.

28:39.182 --> 28:43.602
On a much bigger, nicer, harder,
younger dick, is all I'm saying.

28:43.602 --> 28:45.438
- Can we not?
- OK, sorry.

28:45.438 --> 28:48.608
Because I'm feeling...
I'm having certain anxieties, huh?

28:48.608 --> 28:51.151
- I want to have a good time.
- OK.

28:51.151 --> 28:53.822
All right, let's have fun.
We can monitor her dot together.

28:53.822 --> 28:56.073
Let's get it up on the big screen.

28:56.992 --> 28:59.994
Her dot is at
an aquarium supply retailer.

28:59.994 --> 29:02.414
That doesn't make sense.
Is that a drug thing?

29:02.414 --> 29:03.999
- No.
- You sure?

29:04.415 --> 29:06.126
- I am sure.
- It is. It's a drug thing.

29:06.126 --> 29:07.961
Now she's at a dry cleaner's.

29:07.961 --> 29:10.297
She's probably getting
her panties cleaned.

29:11.089 --> 29:13.215
- I'll be right back.
- What's wrong with you?

29:13.215 --> 29:16.927
- Your cum, I'm sure, is very washable.
- Stop.

29:21.182 --> 29:23.268
Yo, Lucas.
What's up, brother?

29:23.268 --> 29:24.561
What's up?

29:25.769 --> 29:28.189
Can't fucking sleep.
Did you sleep good?

29:30.482 --> 29:32.986
Honestly, not really. No.

29:32.986 --> 29:35.654
I've never met anyone I respect
who sleeps good.

29:35.654 --> 29:37.115
Tell me about it.

29:37.115 --> 29:39.617
One eye open, bro.
One eye open.

29:40.243 --> 29:42.329
Secondly, my team says
I shouldn't be talking to you

29:42.329 --> 29:44.246
about this, but whatever.

29:44.246 --> 29:48.335
I've been hearing that the activists
hustling on the price

29:48.335 --> 29:51.629
are trying to get you to join
their little scheisse party.

29:51.629 --> 29:53.422
Is that true?

29:53.422 --> 29:58.052
I can't give you a play by play.

29:58.052 --> 30:00.805
Well, I know that you tried to screw
this deal with your dad,

30:00.805 --> 30:05.601
and I know your dad hates you
now, so you're out of options.

30:06.770 --> 30:08.980
And I've also been hearing
that you've been going around

30:08.980 --> 30:11.316
offering old ladies
suitcases full of money.

30:11.316 --> 30:15.654
If you want to have a full suitcase
anytime soon, you don't push me.

30:15.654 --> 30:18.489
- OK, dude.
- He's going to sell.

30:18.489 --> 30:21.575
But if he pushes me again,
it won't be to me.

30:22.910 --> 30:24.246
This isn't aggressive.

30:24.246 --> 30:27.039
I've been told that sometimes
when I'm direct,

30:27.039 --> 30:31.001
it can code aggressive, but it's not.
I like you.

30:31.001 --> 30:35.923
I do. I want clarity, you know,
before any nukes get launched.

30:35.923 --> 30:37.424
OK?

30:37.424 --> 30:40.720
So either back off,
or I'm going to walk.

30:40.720 --> 30:42.597
I got you. Loud and clear.

30:42.597 --> 30:45.350
OK.
I think that's it, K-Roy.

30:45.350 --> 30:46.850
Yeah, sweet dreams.

31:11.834 --> 31:16.965
Send me the detail
on the comparables.

31:27.684 --> 31:31.354
Storm warnings have been issued
in parts of the east,

31:31.354 --> 31:34.773
as severe thunderstorms
are expected to hit Pennsylvania

31:34.773 --> 31:36.609
and the Carolinas today...

31:42.198 --> 31:47.328
This is an incredibly delicate
piece of diplomacy, Greg.

31:48.579 --> 31:49.831
OK?

31:49.831 --> 31:56.087
It's like Israel-Palestine, except
harder and much more important.

31:56.087 --> 31:58.465
She is not going to be happy.

31:59.006 --> 32:02.302
- But I think I see a way through.
- What's that?

32:02.302 --> 32:03.761
You tell her.

32:05.931 --> 32:10.726
Yeah, interesting.
I mean, I don't like it.

32:10.726 --> 32:14.188
Well, you're a little frustrated.
You want next level tasks, right?

32:14.188 --> 32:18.485
Yeah, but not like telling our
boss's girlfriend she can't be on TV.

32:19.319 --> 32:23.572
Honestly, I think it tracks.
This is what you do.

32:24.073 --> 32:28.202
All right, you go to her,
and you say...

32:28.662 --> 32:32.122
It's really hard even being
the cousin of this family.

32:32.122 --> 32:34.249
And you've seen what's
happened to the kids.

32:34.249 --> 32:35.834
You know, things get muddled.

32:35.834 --> 32:39.381
And then you tell her she's good,
but not too good.

32:39.381 --> 32:43.092
And then you make sure
Logan's out of it and I'm out of it.

32:43.092 --> 32:45.177
And you tell her that the focus group
had thoughts.

32:46.720 --> 32:49.766
And then you ask her,
does she even really want it

32:49.766 --> 32:51.851
handed to her on a silver platter,

32:51.851 --> 32:54.103
with all the resentments
and accusations?

32:54.103 --> 32:57.816
And then you can make it seem like
it's her idea to cool things, right?

32:58.983 --> 33:00.567
OK.

33:01.486 --> 33:03.737
But if she's like, fuck you, Greg,

33:03.737 --> 33:06.824
and I want to be on TV
tomorrow, ATN is my home...

33:06.824 --> 33:09.369
Well, then, if that happens,
just back away

33:09.369 --> 33:12.998
to a position of safety, and I will
march in and mop up the rage.

33:12.998 --> 33:15.333
- OK?
- All right.

33:18.628 --> 33:20.255
God damn it!

33:21.672 --> 33:23.633
- I'm having fun.
- Hey, what's up?

33:23.633 --> 33:26.720
- What'd I miss?
- We here. Eating. Right here.

33:26.720 --> 33:28.889
Billy Ray Cyrus'
Kentucky Fried Shit Shack.

33:28.889 --> 33:31.182
They seem to have some hearty fare.

33:31.975 --> 33:34.518
- What was that shit?
- Stewy.

33:35.896 --> 33:37.354
Great. What the fuck now?

33:37.354 --> 33:40.066
Actually, guys,
can I show you something?

33:40.066 --> 33:43.778
Wings. I wonder from which particular
creature they snip these wings.

33:43.778 --> 33:45.446
Perhaps a mammal.

33:45.446 --> 33:46.907
On the comparables.

33:47.824 --> 33:49.993
It's actually pretty fucking intriguing.

33:49.993 --> 33:51.452
OK, well, it makes you think.

33:51.452 --> 33:53.580
Maybe Dad isn't on it
like he used to be.

33:53.580 --> 33:55.415
And he's been pushed around
by Matsson.

33:55.415 --> 33:57.958
And by Kerry.
Giving shows to his girlfriend...

33:58.667 --> 34:02.296
Fuck, she's in the East River.
She's in the fucking... What?

34:02.756 --> 34:05.174
She's on the bridge.
She's headed to Williamsburg.

34:05.174 --> 34:09.345
Not to be dicks, but is it OK
if we do a little breakout chat

34:09.345 --> 34:12.182
just the three of us? It won't be long.
Two minutes max.

34:12.182 --> 34:15.100
Hey, fuck it.
Why don't we fold Con in?

34:15.100 --> 34:19.105
- Well, he's not on the board.
- But he has a share, so if the deal...

34:19.105 --> 34:20.523
- He loses his payout.
- Excuse me?

34:20.523 --> 34:24.568
Yeah. Shiv wants to get us mixed
up in some sort of drug deal

34:24.568 --> 34:26.362
that will fuck the vote tomorrow.

34:26.362 --> 34:29.074
No. A small delay.
We all want the deal.

34:29.074 --> 34:31.618
- OK.
- And look, I think I agree.

34:31.618 --> 34:34.746
What the fuck now?
Seriously?

34:35.288 --> 34:38.416
Looking at the numbers...
It's compelling.

34:38.416 --> 34:40.376
It's compelling? Come on.

34:40.376 --> 34:45.465
So you're going to force Dad to grovel?
How long will a renegotiation take?

34:45.465 --> 34:47.216
It's a play.

34:47.216 --> 34:49.970
More money is more money,
and that's all there is to it.

34:53.014 --> 34:55.392
I'm sorry.
What the fuck?

34:57.643 --> 34:58.853
Roman.

34:58.853 --> 35:00.897
Why the fuck is Dad
messaging you for, Rome?

35:01.982 --> 35:03.899
I don't know. Ask him.

35:04.276 --> 35:05.484
Stupid question.

35:08.279 --> 35:09.822
You're not going to read it?

35:11.366 --> 35:14.034
Yeah, I'll read it. I don't know.
Yeah, sure.

35:14.034 --> 35:16.538
Whatever.
Just a check-in.

35:17.162 --> 35:19.332
- Yeah? A check-in?
- Yeah.

35:19.332 --> 35:22.210
Yeah, you're right. Classic Dad.
He always just checks in.

35:22.210 --> 35:23.669
Just wants to see how you're doing.

35:23.669 --> 35:26.589
I sent him a text on his birthday,
just saying, happy birthday.

35:26.589 --> 35:29.967
I'm sorry. Wait a minute.
You texted him initially?

35:29.967 --> 35:31.136
On his birthday.

35:31.136 --> 35:33.930
We said no contact
until he apologizes.

35:33.930 --> 35:35.849
- OK, well, so then never?
- You know what?

35:35.849 --> 35:38.183
- What?
- I would like to see your phone.

35:38.183 --> 35:39.978
Really?
Show me your phone.

35:39.978 --> 35:42.855
World's biggest WhatsApp group of
people sharing pictures of your snatch.

35:42.855 --> 35:44.940
- No thanks.
- Rome.

35:44.940 --> 35:46.442
What?

35:46.442 --> 35:49.069
- We have to trust each other here.
- Then fucking look.

35:49.069 --> 35:51.071
I don't give a shit.
It's dick pics anyway.

35:51.071 --> 35:54.492
He's got a real taste for them now.
It's this right here. Read.

35:54.492 --> 35:58.079
- This is more than one text.
- It's two, three?

35:58.079 --> 36:00.581
- It's more than one. Sorry.
- It's a bit warm.

36:00.581 --> 36:02.334
What did I say?

36:02.334 --> 36:03.877
- Take care.
- Take care?

36:03.877 --> 36:05.545
What am I supposed to say?
Happy birthday.

36:05.545 --> 36:07.672
Hope you fall down a flight of stairs, shithead.

36:07.672 --> 36:09.924
You know what? I feel a little bit weird
about this betrayal.

36:09.924 --> 36:14.553
The betrayal? Yes, the betrayal
of happy birthday, dad.

36:14.553 --> 36:16.597
- Take care, Roman.
- You know what?

36:16.597 --> 36:18.099
- I do too.
- OK, great.

36:18.099 --> 36:20.726
Fucking family guilt trip.
European vacation. Let's do it.

36:20.726 --> 36:23.479
It's hard.
It's been hard on everybody.

36:23.479 --> 36:26.858
You know that he advised
Tom on the divorce?

36:27.733 --> 36:28.944
Gave him a dad trick.

36:29.444 --> 36:32.947
Went and spoke to every pitbull
in Manhattan, tied them up.

36:33.280 --> 36:34.448
I got mommed.

36:34.907 --> 36:39.329
I mean, there's probably one
more horrible motherfucker lawyer

36:39.329 --> 36:42.082
somewhere in the United States,
if you want to look.

36:42.082 --> 36:45.585
But yeah, that sucks.
I'm sorry.

36:46.586 --> 36:51.090
Guys, I feel like we need to stick
together, and we should push back.

36:51.090 --> 36:53.468
And you should come with us,
and we should put the squeeze on.

36:53.468 --> 36:57.930
But we want to do Pierce, right?
We want to out, right?

36:57.930 --> 36:59.182
- Yes.
- Yeah, exactly.

36:59.182 --> 37:00.809
Just with just a bit more money.

37:00.809 --> 37:03.519
But I don't think Matsson
will go up in price. He won't.

37:03.519 --> 37:05.604
I know this
because I have spoken to him.

37:05.604 --> 37:09.609
Well, if that's what he said,
then it must be true.

37:09.609 --> 37:11.819
OK, seriously?
I think he might walk.

37:11.819 --> 37:14.989
Might he? Yeah, do you think
he could maybe, like...

37:14.989 --> 37:17.951
Is it a possibility
he could say a not?

37:17.951 --> 37:20.495
Like a thing that isn't and lie?

37:20.869 --> 37:22.706
I mean, why would he say that?

37:22.706 --> 37:26.417
Well, it's negotiating 101, Rome.
Did they not teach you that?

37:26.417 --> 37:30.588
- But it sounded like he meant it.
- That's negotiating 102.

37:30.588 --> 37:31.882
It's pretty basic.

37:32.924 --> 37:37.595
Look, I know that conflict isn't nice,
but we overcommitted on Pierce.

37:37.595 --> 37:39.597
And this gives us the cash
to make it right.

37:39.597 --> 37:41.933
- I don't give a shit about conflict.
- Yes, you do.

37:41.933 --> 37:44.351
OK, fine. Well, it is about dad
feelings for you, then.

37:44.351 --> 37:47.063
Dad feelings? If anyone here
has fucking dad feelings,

37:47.063 --> 37:49.691
it's, holy shit, poking
Satan with a fork.

37:49.691 --> 37:51.525
I'm genuine about us three.

37:51.525 --> 37:52.777
And stop ganging up on me

37:52.777 --> 37:54.821
like you're Lennon and McCartney
and I'm fucking George.

37:54.821 --> 37:57.991
I'm John, motherfuckers.
Ringo, Yoko.

37:58.992 --> 38:02.578
He's still Connor, but he won
having drinks with us at an auction.

38:02.578 --> 38:08.460
Honestly, though, I think
going with Sandy and Stewy

38:08.460 --> 38:12.130
is the best thing for us
to do as a team.

38:13.173 --> 38:16.634
It's just a move.
It's a delay, a couple of weeks.

38:17.469 --> 38:20.262
He'll get it.
It's what dad would do in his prime.

38:20.262 --> 38:21.514
Exactly.

38:23.265 --> 38:26.435
I guess if it's just a play,
then yeah, fuck, yeah, I'm in.

38:26.435 --> 38:29.814
- God fucking damn it!
- Sorry.

38:29.814 --> 38:32.525
You ruined it all.
You fucking ruined it all.

38:32.525 --> 38:34.069
Sorry.

38:34.902 --> 38:36.780
- What do you want to do?
- What do I want to do?

38:36.780 --> 38:38.447
I wanted to get married tomorrow.

38:38.447 --> 38:40.283
I wanted to spend tonight
with my family

38:40.283 --> 38:43.411
and tomorrow with my dad, and I
wanted to get my fucking money out.

38:43.411 --> 38:45.121
What else could we do?

38:46.164 --> 38:48.625
I would like to sing
one fucking song

38:48.625 --> 38:50.876
at karaoke because
I've seen it in the movies

38:50.876 --> 38:53.213
and nobody ever wants to go.

39:04.431 --> 39:06.642
Hey, Kerry.

39:06.642 --> 39:10.271
Sorry, can I possibly please
grab you just for five minutes

39:10.271 --> 39:11.565
quickly, please?

39:11.565 --> 39:15.318
Why not? You've already grabbed
every other woman in Manhattan.

39:15.318 --> 39:17.821
Thank you.
Let's just head in here.

39:21.156 --> 39:23.951
I just wanted to grab you
for a quick moment.

39:25.203 --> 39:28.497
I hope I'm not getting
above my station here,

39:28.497 --> 39:32.251
but I wanted to talk to you
about the whole tape thing.

39:32.251 --> 39:35.005
I'm not sure I want to talk to you
about that.

39:35.005 --> 39:36.715
Yeah, no, fair enough.

39:36.715 --> 39:41.845
Then just as a friend,
I wanted to give you a heads up

39:42.387 --> 39:45.348
on the down low
on what the murmurs are

39:45.348 --> 39:50.352
and say how careful I have
had to be about my particular position

39:50.352 --> 39:54.232
as a family member
and say how people chatter

39:54.232 --> 39:58.570
so unpleasantly about
accusations of legs up and unfair...

39:58.570 --> 40:00.738
What is this, Greg?

40:03.532 --> 40:07.871
Are you rushing things a bit?

40:07.871 --> 40:11.958
And could that long term
actually harm your position?

40:11.958 --> 40:15.086
Tom doesn't think I'm ready
and he's sent you to...

40:15.086 --> 40:18.340
Not at all.
He thinks you're great.

40:19.925 --> 40:21.885
I mean, there are some little
doubts from a focus group.

40:21.885 --> 40:23.177
They focus grouped me?

40:23.177 --> 40:25.804
Yes, but the big picture
is what I'm saying.

40:25.804 --> 40:30.100
You know, like how Kendall and Shiv
have an entitlement...

40:30.100 --> 40:32.645
OK, I'm sorry.
What did they say in the focus group?

40:34.188 --> 40:36.524
Well, headlines, great.

40:37.858 --> 40:43.572
Just maybe not fully there
and a few criticisms.

40:43.572 --> 40:44.824
Such as?

40:44.824 --> 40:46.451
Minor shit, like nothing.

40:47.494 --> 40:51.081
I mean, great package,
maybe a little...

40:51.081 --> 40:55.542
Arms aren't right,
or they're a little, on TV...

40:55.542 --> 40:57.295
The arms aren't right?

40:57.295 --> 41:01.757
No, yeah, but not a biggie.
Fixable with a few years.

41:01.757 --> 41:04.594
But no, sorry, this is on TV.

41:04.594 --> 41:07.179
And it can happen that they
shoot weird...

41:07.179 --> 41:10.266
So who is in this focus group, Greg?
Just you?

41:10.266 --> 41:12.393
- No.
- Is it Tom? Logan?

41:12.393 --> 41:13.979
No.

41:13.979 --> 41:17.606
It's a bunch of grandpas
and little twerps and such.

41:17.606 --> 41:18.941
- Can I see it?
- No.

41:18.941 --> 41:20.443
- Because?
- Because it's private.

41:20.443 --> 41:22.653
Well, it's not.
What if Logan wants to see it?

41:22.653 --> 41:24.822
- I'm sorry, it's confidential.
- From the CEO?

41:24.822 --> 41:26.032
Yes.

41:26.032 --> 41:27.408
If this focus group isn't real,

41:27.408 --> 41:29.619
I'm going to take you apart
like a human string cheese.

41:29.619 --> 41:30.995
Understood.

41:35.458 --> 41:38.169
I did the job.

41:38.169 --> 41:39.461
I did the job.

41:55.102 --> 41:56.604
Heard from Connor.

41:58.230 --> 41:59.357
OK.

41:59.941 --> 42:03.069
The kids, Sandy and Stewy,
they have the numbers

42:03.069 --> 42:04.738
to force us back to the table.

42:05.280 --> 42:07.656
What do you do?
You want me to call?

42:07.656 --> 42:09.533
- You want me to ream 'em out?
- No.

42:09.993 --> 42:14.080
Delicate.
They have some juice here.

42:16.166 --> 42:18.459
They have some fucking juice.

42:19.669 --> 42:22.546
You should share your
fucking dot with Willa.

42:22.546 --> 42:24.715
She'll see that you're out having fun.

42:24.715 --> 42:26.717
I love karaoke. It's great.

42:28.720 --> 42:30.054
This wedding is doomed.

42:34.434 --> 42:36.810
- OK.
- Thank you.

42:37.311 --> 42:38.771
So what happens now?

42:39.689 --> 42:44.236
Well, someone has to humiliate
themselves in the shame palace.

42:44.236 --> 42:46.153
Think they have "Desperado"
by the Eagles?

42:46.612 --> 42:49.532
I would imagine they do.
Longest night of my life.

42:50.908 --> 42:52.118
Shit.

42:53.036 --> 42:54.704
- What?
- She's gone dark.

42:56.248 --> 42:59.000
Why has she gone dark?
I mean, is this it?

42:59.000 --> 43:01.920
- Is she going off with some buck...
- Hey, take it easy.

43:01.920 --> 43:03.630
Maybe her phone just died.

43:03.630 --> 43:06.174
Yeah, have you ever considered
that she might not be right for you?

43:06.174 --> 43:07.383
This could be good.

43:07.383 --> 43:09.009
- Connor.
- You'll meet someone else.

43:11.012 --> 43:15.058
- You're not doing better than Willa.
- I would agree. Do not let Willa go.

43:15.058 --> 43:16.433
Romulus.

43:18.435 --> 43:24.149
- So Dad's on his way.
- What?

43:24.149 --> 43:27.070
He wants us to meet him down
at the car when he gets here.

43:27.070 --> 43:29.446
- What the fuck?
- How does he know we're here?

43:29.446 --> 43:30.864
How do you know he's coming?

43:30.864 --> 43:34.327
Well, I told him that it's the
night of 1 000 wobbles over here

43:34.327 --> 43:35.744
and he needs to talk to you.

43:35.744 --> 43:36.997
For fuck's sake, Con.

43:36.997 --> 43:39.707
My life isn't filled with
secrets like some people.

43:39.707 --> 43:43.628
I share things and I want
my father to be at my wedding.

43:43.628 --> 43:46.005
- You mean you want the money?
- Well, no, Siobhan.

43:46.005 --> 43:48.508
That was not my primary consideration.

43:48.508 --> 43:51.595
I mean, what do we do?
Do we leave?

43:51.595 --> 43:53.971
I mean, will he come in?
He's not coming in, right?

43:53.971 --> 43:56.182
You know what?
Just be water, my friend.

43:56.182 --> 43:58.142
Just be water?
Thanks, man.

43:58.142 --> 43:59.685
What happens if I kill a Buddhist?

43:59.685 --> 44:02.271
Do I get reincarnated
as a fucking Buddhist?

44:02.271 --> 44:03.731
I hope not.

44:34.930 --> 44:39.725
This is Guantanamo level shit.
What is this, Con?

44:40.644 --> 44:43.563
I think I would like to hear
Desperado. Please?

44:49.610 --> 44:52.237
OK.
I don't know why Dad's calling me.

44:52.237 --> 44:54.074
Well, really, he should be calling me.

44:54.074 --> 44:55.575
What did we say?
Don't answer it.

44:55.575 --> 44:57.827
- But I'm not.
- Hang up.

44:59.078 --> 45:02.122
I could just...
I was going to let it ring out.

45:02.122 --> 45:04.417
Shit. Of course.
I didn't think of that.

45:11.507 --> 45:12.633
Oh my God!

45:31.860 --> 45:33.070
Hey.

45:33.738 --> 45:34.989
Shit.

45:37.616 --> 45:41.370
Can we go somewhere else?
These lights...

45:41.370 --> 45:42.913
I could have a seashell.

45:43.789 --> 45:46.458
- We're not going anywhere.
- Fine. Very well.

45:54.341 --> 45:57.596
We won't be needing you, Kerry.
You can... Thank you.

45:57.596 --> 46:00.055
This here is a family fuck-fuck.

46:03.435 --> 46:04.852
Normie.

46:04.852 --> 46:08.648
OK, let's get this figured out, and
then I can let you get back to your fun.

46:08.648 --> 46:10.317
It might have been a wasted trip.

46:10.317 --> 46:12.610
Want to give us a quick blast
of New York, New York and fuck off?

46:12.610 --> 46:14.404
- I wanted to say something.
- Yeah?

46:14.404 --> 46:17.449
Reasons we should vote through
the sale? It's no surprises there.

46:17.449 --> 46:20.367
Unless you do it to the tune
of "The Girl from Ipanema".

46:20.367 --> 46:22.162
Well, it's not that.

46:22.746 --> 46:25.790
I mean, aside from this...
I guess...

46:27.500 --> 46:31.171
I wanted you there a bit at my party.

46:31.920 --> 46:33.464
Holy shit!

46:34.924 --> 46:37.302
Did Dad just say a feeling?

46:37.302 --> 46:40.472
Well, you know, I thought
maybe it would be nice.

46:40.472 --> 46:42.474
Fuck!
Now it's all coming out.

46:42.474 --> 46:44.601
Oh my God,
Mr. Melodrama over here.

46:44.601 --> 46:46.728
- It's like a fucking telenovela.
- Come on, guys.

46:46.728 --> 46:47.854
He's trying something.

46:47.854 --> 46:51.732
Look, you knew I wanted
Pierce from way back.

46:53.109 --> 46:57.572
And when I lost out,
that was not a good feeling.

46:57.572 --> 47:01.326
Yeah, no shit.
I had to walk back from Albany.

47:01.326 --> 47:04.037
Can we just... I'm sorry.
Can we cut the shit?

47:04.037 --> 47:05.287
It's obvious why you're here.

47:05.287 --> 47:09.084
Your father wanted to address
the personal stuff

47:09.084 --> 47:10.752
and not just launch into the business.

47:10.752 --> 47:16.925
Well, see, this isn't personal, Dad.
This is a business decision.

47:17.926 --> 47:19.469
This is about the money.

47:19.469 --> 47:22.722
Look, you're smart to ask
about the money. You are.

47:22.722 --> 47:25.099
But Matsson won't go there.

47:26.309 --> 47:29.354
You haven't been around this,
but I've got done a good deal,

47:30.187 --> 47:32.940
and you'll get enough
to do whatever you want.

47:32.940 --> 47:35.735
I do ATM.
You do Pierce.

47:35.735 --> 47:38.905
It'll be a fresh start for all of us.
It'll make things better.

47:38.905 --> 47:40.155
And it starts there.

47:40.155 --> 47:44.160
All you have to do is vote yes
and support the deal.

47:47.955 --> 47:50.208
Do you know what he's offering?

47:50.208 --> 47:52.751
You can separate the personal
and the business.

47:52.751 --> 47:55.005
You can reset your dynamic
as a family.

47:55.005 --> 47:59.425
Super. We're going
to be just how like we used to be

47:59.425 --> 48:01.720
and go on summer vacay together

48:01.720 --> 48:05.015
and drive down Route 1 in an RV,
singing show tunes?

48:05.015 --> 48:07.224
It may be more complicated than that.

48:07.224 --> 48:09.227
I guess you're still
in the honeymoon period,

48:09.227 --> 48:11.562
so getting your own show on TV.

48:12.856 --> 48:15.984
Are you not going to be on TV now?
No?

48:15.984 --> 48:19.571
I'm sorry. Is that not...
Has he fucked you on that?

48:20.195 --> 48:22.240
That'll happen, the fucking.

48:22.240 --> 48:23.991
But congrats on losing
your betrayal cherry.

48:23.991 --> 48:25.911
Enough!

48:26.660 --> 48:30.331
I thought you'd be interested
in an apology, but that's enough.

48:30.331 --> 48:33.543
Wait, I'm sorry. An apology?
We missed that.

48:33.543 --> 48:39.216
Look, I don't do apologies,
but if it means so much to you,

48:40.508 --> 48:43.302
then sorry.

48:50.227 --> 48:53.355
There is nothing you could say to me
now that I would ever believe.

48:53.355 --> 48:56.441
This deal push could be worth
a hundred mil to us, Dad.

48:56.441 --> 48:58.568
How many sorrys do we get for that?

48:59.236 --> 49:00.986
Okay.
To be clear, he was trying...

49:00.986 --> 49:03.155
What are you actually sorry for, Dad?

49:03.155 --> 49:06.034
Well, I'm sorry for the helicopter,
for a start.

49:06.034 --> 49:09.244
You guys, he's sorry
about the helicopter from today.

49:09.244 --> 49:12.165
- Well, that's the big one, I guess.
- Are we actually doing this, Dad?

49:12.165 --> 49:13.875
'Cause I think, you know,

49:15.000 --> 49:20.714
seriously, what fucked all this
was when... With Mom and Italy.

49:20.714 --> 49:24.177
Yeah, okay.
I've had certain thoughts about that.

49:25.637 --> 49:27.596
Look, with the best of intentions,

49:29.098 --> 49:31.100
I got the structure
of the holding company,

49:31.100 --> 49:34.062
the ownership structure
of the family trust.

49:34.563 --> 49:37.898
There is a lack of clarity,
and maybe you got...

49:37.898 --> 49:41.026
Amazing.
Sure you're not having that seizure?

49:41.026 --> 49:42.569
I mean, he is trying, right?

49:42.569 --> 49:45.532
What you said you were
interested in was an apology.

49:46.616 --> 49:49.327
Okay, then.
Anything else?

49:54.039 --> 49:56.418
Come on, Dad.
What are you sorry for?

49:56.875 --> 50:00.004
Sorry for fucking ignoring
Connor his whole life?

50:00.004 --> 50:01.172
Bit strong.

50:01.172 --> 50:02.923
Hitting Rome when he was a kid?

50:02.923 --> 50:05.886
No. I mean, everyone hit me.
I'm fucking annoying.

50:05.886 --> 50:07.761
Having Connor's mother locked up?

50:07.761 --> 50:09.973
Can we not do
a whole show trial here?

50:09.973 --> 50:13.310
What about advising Tom
on my divorce? Yeah?

50:13.310 --> 50:16.478
That took effort.
That was above and beyond.

50:16.478 --> 50:18.356
Tom asked me for advice.

50:18.899 --> 50:21.026
I recommended someone
he could speak to.

50:21.692 --> 50:22.901
You weren't around.

50:23.570 --> 50:27.489
If you'd been around, I would
have offered you the same advice.

50:27.489 --> 50:30.410
But I can't help you
if you won't see me.

50:30.869 --> 50:35.873
Look, the bottom line is, if we
ask for more money, Matsson walks.

50:36.457 --> 50:38.793
- I know that.
- No, you don't know that.

50:38.793 --> 50:41.421
You don't know him.
You don't fucking know everything.

50:42.380 --> 50:44.549
Just because you say it
doesn't make it true.

50:44.549 --> 50:47.177
Everyone just fucking agrees
with you and believes you,

50:47.177 --> 50:48.553
so it becomes true,

50:48.553 --> 50:50.805
and then you can turn around
and say, like, "You see?

50:50.805 --> 50:54.768
"See? I was right."
But that is not how it is.

50:54.768 --> 50:57.020
You're a human fucking gaslight.

51:11.576 --> 51:15.872
Look, I just want to get us
all together.

51:17.290 --> 51:20.877
What you kids don't realize,
this is a good deal.

51:20.877 --> 51:23.212
The world likes it. It makes sense.

51:24.838 --> 51:27.676
But deals have a habit
of disappearing

51:27.676 --> 51:31.930
because pricks like Matsson
get pissed off or snubbed.

51:31.930 --> 51:35.100
This is fucking real.

51:38.018 --> 51:41.563
Okay, well, I think I can speak
for everyone, can I?

51:41.563 --> 51:45.234
When I say,
"Go ask him for more money."

51:45.234 --> 51:47.903
- But why?
- Just good business sense.

51:48.572 --> 51:51.825
- Gotta make our own pile.
- Come on!

51:51.825 --> 51:55.287
It's what my gut is telling me,
so I gotta listen to my gut.

51:55.287 --> 51:57.663
- It's all I got to go on.
- Jesus.

52:02.669 --> 52:05.672
You're such fucking dopes.

52:06.882 --> 52:11.176
You are not serious figures.
I love you,

52:13.597 --> 52:14.930
but you are not...

52:18.058 --> 52:19.436
... serious people.

52:42.124 --> 52:45.378
Look at this prick.
They should get out here.

52:46.170 --> 52:48.714
Some cunt doing the tin cans
for his supper.

52:48.714 --> 52:50.466
Take a sip of that medicine.

52:52.551 --> 52:54.428
This city...

52:55.554 --> 53:00.143
The rats are as fat as skunks.
They hardly care to run anymore.

53:01.186 --> 53:04.521
I don't know.
I don't fucking know.

53:05.898 --> 53:07.275
The meeting's off.

53:08.525 --> 53:09.777
I need to see Matsson.

53:10.403 --> 53:16.325
It'll be you, me, Tom,
Karl, Frank, but no Gerri.

53:16.325 --> 53:17.576
Fine.

53:22.665 --> 53:26.251
So, how was it for you,
fucking dad?

53:27.045 --> 53:30.005
Amazing.
Just over too soon.

53:30.005 --> 53:31.758
I could've kept going.

53:33.426 --> 53:35.177
We're kidding, man.

53:35.177 --> 53:37.556
No, I know. It's fine. It's cool.

53:39.057 --> 53:41.976
Okay. I'm going home.

53:41.976 --> 53:45.480
Well, I'm sure she'll be in touch, Con.

53:45.480 --> 53:47.023
You know what? It's fine.

53:48.357 --> 53:50.317
- Really?
- Yeah.

53:51.277 --> 53:53.362
The good thing about having
a family that doesn't love you

53:53.362 --> 53:55.365
is you learn to live without it.

53:56.156 --> 53:58.410
You're all chasing after dad

53:58.410 --> 54:03.123
saying, "love me, please, love me,
I need love, I need attention."

54:03.123 --> 54:04.915
I think it's the opposite
of what just happened.

54:04.915 --> 54:07.042
You're needy love sponges.

54:08.002 --> 54:09.670
And I'm a plant
that grows on rocks

54:09.670 --> 54:12.090
and lives off insects
that die inside of me.

54:12.840 --> 54:14.758
Jesus Christ, Con.

54:15.510 --> 54:18.012
If Willa doesn't come back,
that's fine,

54:18.012 --> 54:21.433
'cause I don't need love.
It's like a superpower.

54:22.725 --> 54:25.604
And if she comes back
and doesn't love me,

54:25.604 --> 54:28.231
that's okay, too,
'cause I don't need it.

54:32.193 --> 54:33.652
Thanks for the party.

54:37.032 --> 54:38.407
You're welcome.

55:40.178 --> 55:43.848
Hey, Dad.
Hey, looky, looky here!

55:43.848 --> 55:46.268
Twin Cities Tessie.
I thought I smelled dairy.

55:47.269 --> 55:52.107
So that just felt a bit weird,
and there was a lot going on.

55:52.856 --> 55:54.693
We know what they're like.

55:56.736 --> 55:58.196
I've pushed the board meeting.

55:58.196 --> 56:00.824
I want you to come with me
and see Matsson tomorrow.

56:00.824 --> 56:02.241
I could use your help.

56:02.825 --> 56:03.909
Yeah?

56:04.743 --> 56:07.122
I mean, it's the wedding,
Con's wedding.

56:09.249 --> 56:11.625
But that feels...
Yeah, let's see.

56:12.919 --> 56:15.505
Tom. Thank you.

56:16.631 --> 56:18.174
Yeah, sure.

56:22.469 --> 56:23.847
- Here.
- OK.

56:32.438 --> 56:34.982
There's a night
of the long knives coming.

56:36.066 --> 56:40.738
Cyd's toast, I'm reinventing ATN.

56:40.738 --> 56:42.489
I need a fire breather.

56:42.489 --> 56:45.576
A ruthless fuck
who'll do whatever it takes.

56:46.493 --> 56:49.915
- Maybe I should go.
- You're not Pierce.

56:54.918 --> 56:57.963
Smart people know what they are.

57:00.300 --> 57:02.176
I mean, you really want me at ATN?

57:02.176 --> 57:05.096
More, Romulus. More.

57:06.972 --> 57:08.183
I need you.
