WEBVTT

00:09.999 --> 00:11.999
Keeping
Up with the Kardashians...

00:11.999 --> 00:13.999
You guys don't have to like each
other, but don't discredit the

00:13.999 --> 00:15.999
25-plus years of marriage you
guys had.

00:15.999 --> 00:18.999
When I'm reading
article,

00:18.999 --> 00:21.999
there's just no reason to bash
my mom.

00:21.999 --> 00:24.999
What up, Las Vegas?
What's going on?

00:24.999 --> 00:27.999
When's the last

00:27.999 --> 00:30.999
time you talked to him?
Scott seems to just get worse.

00:30.999 --> 00:32.999
"Scott Disick gets
hands-on with brunette."

00:32.999 --> 00:36.999
- He's a.
- I've worked so hard

00:36.999 --> 00:48.999
to keep this family together.
I need to be done.

00:48.999 --> 00:50.999
Oh, we need to have
a talk.

00:50.999 --> 00:52.999
So I really want to get my
ears pierced.

00:52.999 --> 00:54.999
What?! You don't have
your ears pierced?

00:54.999 --> 00:56.999
I have one hole that
you and Ron Hardy took me to

00:56.999 --> 00:59.999
when I was four at the Century
City Mall, and I ran out

00:59.999 --> 01:01.999
- the store.
- Relax.

01:01.999 --> 01:03.999
- No, you relax.
- Oh, my God.

01:03.999 --> 01:05.999
And I remember every
minute of it.

01:05.999 --> 01:07.999
I feel so bad.
Were you traumatized?

01:07.999 --> 01:09.999
- Duh, Sherlock.
- You can have them

01:09.999 --> 01:11.999
re-pierced.
- She doesn't have a

01:11.999 --> 01:13.999
- problem.
- Who is she talking to?

01:13.999 --> 01:15.999
I don't need to sew up my ear
holes.

01:15.999 --> 01:17.999
- I want to get another ear hole.
- Okay.

01:17.999 --> 01:19.999
- But I'm scared...
- I do think I want

01:19.999 --> 01:22.999
- to sew up my belly button hole.
- I told you to.

01:22.999 --> 01:23.999
I'm gonna sew up my
vagina.

01:23.999 --> 01:25.999
What?

01:41.999 --> 01:43.999
You know what I was
thinking?

01:43.999 --> 01:47.999
I wonder if I should build a
guardhouse, like, by the side

01:47.999 --> 01:49.999
of my gate, just so that, like,
when you pull up, there's

01:49.999 --> 01:52.999
- always, like, a guard.
- There's a company that

01:52.999 --> 01:56.999
makes real-life dolls.
They're so real that people have

01:56.999 --> 02:00.999
sex with them.
That's what they're made for.

02:00.999 --> 02:02.999
We should go to the factory and
check 'em out, because we can

02:02.999 --> 02:04.999
- order...
- But why would you want

02:04.999 --> 02:06.999
- to order one?
- For your

02:06.999 --> 02:09.999
- guard gate.
- Except for the fact that

02:09.999 --> 02:11.999
he cannot move and operate and
answer the gate.

02:11.999 --> 02:14.999
- Oh.
- Did you see those

02:14.999 --> 02:16.999
pictures I sent you?
Of Scott?

02:16.999 --> 02:18.999
There are pictures of him
partying.

02:18.999 --> 02:20.999
And then it's, like, all on the
Internet today that they broke

02:20.999 --> 02:22.999
up, 'cause apparently he's
telling everyone, like, "I'm

02:22.999 --> 02:24.999
single."
Ready to mingle.

02:24.999 --> 02:27.999
Yeah.
Kourtney and Scott have

02:27.999 --> 02:30.999
officially broken up, and it's
really hard on her.

02:30.999 --> 02:33.999
It breaks my heart, 'cause she's
put nine years into this

02:33.999 --> 02:36.999
relationship, and I couldn't
even imagine what it must be

02:36.999 --> 02:39.999
- like having three kids.
- Did anybody find him

02:39.999 --> 02:41.999
today?
He was MIA, like, for the

02:41.999 --> 02:43.999
- last...
- There were pictures of

02:43.999 --> 02:45.999
- him partying in Miami.
- Miami?

02:45.999 --> 02:48.999
Mm-hmm.

02:48.999 --> 02:50.999
This bee is freaking me
out.

02:50.999 --> 02:52.999
- Where did it go?
- It's right here.

02:52.999 --> 02:54.999
There's a drought, so
they're all looking...

02:54.999 --> 02:56.999
- Oh.
- Like, they hang out at

02:56.999 --> 02:58.999
my fountain.
Okay, I'm out of here.

02:58.999 --> 03:08.999
Too many bees.
I'm allergic.

03:18.999 --> 03:22.999
- Ms. Kardashian?
- I'm in San Francisco

03:22.999 --> 03:26.999
today on a panel with the former
Superior Court Judge Cordell.

03:26.999 --> 03:29.999
We are sitting on a panel to

03:29.999 --> 03:33.999
talk about women's beliefs and
confidence and power and

03:33.999 --> 03:35.999
- sexiness.
- What is your advice

03:35.999 --> 03:39.999
for the young woman who wants to
make it in the business world?

03:39.999 --> 03:41.999
People just want to put
you in a certain box.

03:41.999 --> 03:44.999
I'd encourage people to find
their passion.

03:44.999 --> 03:48.999
Be determined and have drive.

03:48.999 --> 03:52.999
Thank you!
Bye! Thank you for having me.

03:52.999 --> 03:54.999
You're so nice to me.
Thank you.

03:54.999 --> 03:56.999
- You were great.
- Oh, good. Thank you.

03:56.999 --> 03:57.999
- So were you.
- Take care,

03:57.999 --> 03:59.999
- all right?
- Thank you. You, too.

03:59.999 --> 04:00.999
Good luck with
the baby.

04:00.999 --> 04:01.999
- Oh, thank you.
- All right?

04:01.999 --> 04:03.999
- Take care.
- Thanks.

04:03.999 --> 04:07.999
All right.

04:07.999 --> 04:09.999
- Hey.
- Hello.

04:09.999 --> 04:11.999
I'm in San Francisco.
I had this talk, and now I'm

04:11.999 --> 04:13.999
- going home.
- Good. That's good

04:13.999 --> 04:15.999
- for you.
- You know, I just had a

04:15.999 --> 04:17.999
thought.
What if I ever had the urge to

04:17.999 --> 04:19.999
call you "Bruiser"?
Just for fun every once in a

04:19.999 --> 04:22.999
- while?
- You can do anything

04:22.999 --> 04:24.999
- you want, you know?
- Okay.

04:24.999 --> 04:27.999
I was thinking.
The ESPYs.

04:27.999 --> 04:30.999
I really wanted, especially,
Kendall and Kylie there.

04:30.999 --> 04:33.999
All the Kardashians and the
Jenners.

04:33.999 --> 04:35.999
- Yeah.
- Just to see the love

04:35.999 --> 04:37.999
and the support that I have
received.

04:37.999 --> 04:40.999
Yeah.
Caitlyn is getting honored with

04:40.999 --> 04:43.999
the Arthur Ashe Courage Award.
We want to go to the ESPYs.

04:43.999 --> 04:47.999
We want to support her, because
this is Caitlyn's first public

04:47.999 --> 04:50.999
appearance.
But I also am really sensitive

04:50.999 --> 04:54.999
towards my mom now, because
Vanity

04:54.999 --> 04:57.999
article that wasn't so
nice to my mom.

04:57.999 --> 05:00.999
But I just have to balance out
both people and make everyone

05:00.999 --> 05:03.999
feel supported.
There's obviously gonna be an

05:03.999 --> 05:05.999
adjustment.
You've gotten an overwhelming

05:05.999 --> 05:09.999
amount of support, and we all
were just praying that you

05:09.999 --> 05:11.999
would, you know, get this type
of reaction, and how amazing

05:11.999 --> 05:13.999
- it's all been.
- Yeah.

05:13.999 --> 05:16.999
Bruiser.
I saw that leopard dress.

05:16.999 --> 05:18.999
Everyone thinks you stole it
from my closet.

05:18.999 --> 05:22.999
They put a side-by-side of us
wearing the same dress.

05:22.999 --> 05:31.999
That's so funny.

05:31.999 --> 05:33.999
That's my new piece of
art.

05:33.999 --> 05:35.999
Don't you love it?
Look at that.

05:35.999 --> 05:37.999
"That was then.
This is now."

05:37.999 --> 05:39.999
That is my new motto of
my life.

05:39.999 --> 05:42.999
- How much was that?
- I can't tell you.

05:42.999 --> 05:45.999
- Oh, no.
- Bruce transitioning was

05:45.999 --> 05:50.999
a really dramatic change for me,
and I'm just trying to deal with

05:50.999 --> 05:53.999
the process of just, you know,
healing.

05:53.999 --> 05:56.999
I really want to wish off all
the negative energy, and it's

05:56.999 --> 06:00.999
- time for a fresh start.
- Question.

06:00.999 --> 06:03.999
- You ready to be honest?
- Okay.

06:03.999 --> 06:05.999
Are you still dating
Corey?

06:05.999 --> 06:09.999
Mm-hmm.
Why?

06:09.999 --> 06:13.999
Just curious.
From what I've seen from Corey,

06:13.999 --> 06:15.999
I really like him.
He really does care about my

06:15.999 --> 06:18.999
mom.
He has to to put up with half of

06:18.999 --> 06:22.999
this.
Now my mom has her smile back,

06:22.999 --> 06:25.999
and I don't really know if it's
because she's  some

06:25.999 --> 06:28.999
really young guy that's making
her feel like Stella got her

06:28.999 --> 06:30.999
groove back.
I'm not sure.

06:30.999 --> 06:33.999
But, hey, let her do her thing,
and I'm just happy that she's

06:33.999 --> 06:35.999
- getting happy.
- I think it's all about

06:35.999 --> 06:37.999
chemistry.
You know what I mean?

06:37.999 --> 06:39.999
You should get to know him.
We're gonna go to Santa Barbara

06:39.999 --> 06:41.999
this weekend.
Why don't you come with us?

06:41.999 --> 06:43.999
I'm not going with my
mom on a  fest.

06:43.999 --> 06:45.999
- Are you kidding?
- A  fest?

06:45.999 --> 06:47.999
He's not inviting you
so he can knit a sweater with

06:47.999 --> 06:49.999
you.
It's called intercourse, sex.

06:49.999 --> 06:51.999
Okay.

06:59.999 --> 07:02.000
Every time I eat Mexican
food, my heart runs on another

07:02.000 --> 07:04.999
- level.
- Really?

07:04.999 --> 07:06.999
Have you heard from
Scott?

07:06.999 --> 07:08.999
- No.
- What are you gonna do

07:08.999 --> 07:12.999
- with all his stuff?
- Mom, can you not?

07:12.999 --> 07:18.999
I have asked Scott to move out

07:18.999 --> 07:22.999
of the house.
As much as we've tried so many

07:22.999 --> 07:29.999
different things, it's just,
like, this is the last resort.

07:29.999 --> 07:33.999
It's really not helping anybody
to keep living this way, and I

07:33.999 --> 07:37.999
feel like this is what we need
to try to hopefully better both

07:37.999 --> 07:40.999
- of our lives.
- Is Scott okay?

07:40.999 --> 07:44.999
Mm... I don't know.
I mean, this is what he wants to

07:44.999 --> 07:50.999
be doing, so there's nothing I
can do at this point, you know?

07:50.999 --> 07:53.999
- That's life.
- You have the weight of

07:53.999 --> 07:56.999
the world on your shoulders,
because you're like a single

07:56.999 --> 07:58.999
mom.
You know what I mean?

07:58.999 --> 08:00.999
Mm-hmm.
- But it's a single mom

08:00.999 --> 08:04.999
waiting for her partner to come
home.

08:04.999 --> 08:08.999
And you don't need to wait for
him to come home anymore.

08:08.999 --> 08:12.999
It's just time to move on and to
find your happiness.

08:12.999 --> 08:14.999
You need somebody really special
in your life.

08:14.999 --> 08:16.999
I don't care about
anybody.

08:16.999 --> 08:18.999
I just want to care for my kids.

08:28.999 --> 08:32.999
You've got to find a
light in your life.

08:32.999 --> 08:40.999
And it breaks my heart to see
you in pain.

08:40.999 --> 08:42.999
You're going for the
ESPYs?

08:42.999 --> 08:45.999
Mm-hmm.
I know my dad's transition is a

08:45.999 --> 08:47.999
- topic of conversation right now.
- Kendall, straight

08:47.999 --> 08:48.999
- ahead!
- I'm very nervous

08:48.999 --> 08:50.999
- about the show.
- Ladies and

08:50.999 --> 08:52.999
- gentlemen, Caitlyn Jenner.
- So you're going to

08:52.999 --> 08:54.999
- Malibu Wines tomorrow?
- I mean, I just think

08:54.999 --> 08:56.999
it would be good for you to come
and get out of the house.

08:56.999 --> 08:58.999
I just don't really
want to go.

08:58.999 --> 09:00.999
I don't know the right
things to always say, the right

09:00.999 --> 09:02.999
things to do.

09:07.999 --> 09:11.000
I'm so done.
I just want to care for my kids.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.999
You've got to find a
light in your life and it breaks

09:14.999 --> 09:19.999
my heart to see you in pain.
I just want to tell you I'm

09:19.999 --> 09:22.999
proud of you, 'cause I've never
seen anybody so strong in

09:22.999 --> 09:28.999
putting up with all this crap.
It's amazing to feel peace of

09:28.999 --> 09:31.999
mind with the person that you're
with.

09:31.999 --> 09:33.999
Like, you'll have so
much time in your life where

09:33.999 --> 09:35.999
- someone will just come in...
- When you least expect

09:35.999 --> 09:37.999
- it.
- You'll find, like,

09:37.999 --> 09:40.999
someone that'll be such a good
influence on your kids and

09:40.999 --> 09:42.999
they'll have, like, such a great
life.

09:42.999 --> 09:45.999
I don't think anybody
expects you to snap out of it,

09:45.999 --> 09:49.999
but you're gonna be okay.
You've got all of us.

09:49.999 --> 09:52.999
As difficult as this is,
to see Kourtney go through this

09:52.999 --> 09:55.999
situation, I really think this
is a step she had to take.

09:55.999 --> 09:58.999
It's time.
There's just been too much of

09:58.999 --> 10:02.999
the same behavior for years.
I know it must be really hard,

10:02.999 --> 10:06.999
but I think a new beginning for
her is really necessary.

10:06.999 --> 10:11.999
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

10:11.999 --> 10:17.999
Let's look on the bright side.
Now I have a huge closet, guys.

10:17.999 --> 10:19.999
There's actually a lot of bright
sides.

10:19.999 --> 10:32.999
The closet is number one.♪ ♪

10:32.999 --> 10:36.999
Look at you!
How is your stomach so flat?

10:36.999 --> 10:39.999
You are such a freak.

10:39.999 --> 10:44.999
What a pretty view.
This is the Khloe I love.

10:44.999 --> 10:46.999
This is the best shape you've
ever been in.

10:46.999 --> 10:47.999
- I'm not there yet.
- Yes, you are.

10:47.999 --> 10:49.999
- You always say that.
- No, I'm...

10:49.999 --> 10:50.999
You've been saying that
for two years and...

10:50.999 --> 10:52.999
I don't know how much closer
you're going to get.

10:52.999 --> 10:53.999
'Cause it's so...
I am just uncomfortable.

10:53.999 --> 10:55.999
Your bellybutton is
tiny.

10:55.999 --> 10:56.999
- Bellybutton?
- That is, like, my pet

10:56.999 --> 10:58.999
peeve.
Mine is so big.

10:58.999 --> 11:00.999
What do you mean?
I hate bellybuttons.

11:00.999 --> 11:02.999
I know, but yours is so
good and small.

11:02.999 --> 11:05.999
You literally look amazing.
I feel like our brand is known

11:05.999 --> 11:08.999
for being sexy, and there is
nothing sexy about me.

11:08.999 --> 11:12.999
Kourtney doesn't really bring
the sexy, I'm not gonna lie.

11:12.999 --> 11:16.999
It's all up to you, right now.
Let me pass my baton on to you.

11:16.999 --> 11:18.999

20:33.999 --> 20:35.999
- loose.
- Kourt, is my hair okay?

20:35.999 --> 20:37.999
I don't know what
okay means.

20:37.999 --> 20:39.999
She has her smile

20:39.999 --> 20:41.999
back, and she's slowly getting
back into the groove.

20:41.999 --> 20:45.999
Time definitely heals a lot of
our open wounds.

20:45.999 --> 20:47.999
Look at the llamas.
They spit at you, don't they?

20:47.999 --> 20:49.999
Yeah, they're not the
friendliest bunch.

20:49.999 --> 20:51.999
Not very nice?
Hey, camel.

20:51.999 --> 20:53.999
- That's E.T.
- E.T.!

20:53.999 --> 20:55.999
- E.T. in the boo!
- "Phone home."

20:55.999 --> 20:57.999
Oh yeah.

20:57.999 --> 20:58.999
This is the cutest
place ever.

20:58.999 --> 21:00.999
- The cutest place ever.
- I am enjoying

21:00.999 --> 21:03.999
myself.
I think it's nice to get out of

21:03.999 --> 21:06.999
the house, do something that I
wouldn't normally do.

21:06.999 --> 21:08.999
You'll want to have
your wedding up here.

21:08.999 --> 21:10.999
We need to find
husbands first.

21:10.999 --> 21:16.999
I am so happy and grateful that
I have such strong people around

21:16.999 --> 21:20.999
- me to keep me feeling positive.
- Look at that bull.

21:20.999 --> 21:22.999
Yeah, that's actually
"Yakety Yak" and "Don't Talk

21:22.999 --> 21:24.999
Back."

21:24.999 --> 21:27.999
That's what I should
have named Khloe and Kourtney.

21:27.999 --> 21:29.999
Oh, you are a big.

21:29.999 --> 21:31.999
Khloe!

21:38.999 --> 21:42.999
- Norman?
- Do you have in mind

21:42.999 --> 21:44.999
what you might want to do for
ESPYs?

21:44.999 --> 21:46.999
Like, do you have something
envisioned that you want to do?

21:46.999 --> 21:48.999
Like, do you want to do, like, a
gown?

21:48.999 --> 21:50.999
Do you want to do a pant suit?
Do you want to do feminine?

21:50.999 --> 21:52.999
I kind of want to do a
gown.

21:52.999 --> 21:54.999
I love this.
That would be really cool for

21:54.999 --> 21:57.999
ESPYs.
Getting ready for the ESPYs is

21:57.999 --> 22:00.999
so exciting.
I'm so happy for Caitlyn.

22:00.999 --> 22:03.999
This is, I mean, really dope
too.

22:03.999 --> 22:05.999
Really cool for
ESPYs.

22:05.999 --> 22:08.999
I just want to look
really good for my dad.

22:12.999 --> 22:14.999
Doesn't she look so
good?

22:14.999 --> 22:17.999
Are ESPYs, like, this
fancy?

22:17.999 --> 22:20.999
I am just so excited for
everyone to be able to hear

22:20.999 --> 22:22.999
- Caitlyn and what she has to say.
- Like, it's amazing.

22:22.999 --> 22:24.999
Yeah, it's really
cool.

22:24.999 --> 22:26.999
- We smell poop.
- Oh, my God.

22:26.999 --> 22:28.999
Norman  somewhere.
Norman?

22:28.999 --> 22:30.999
Oh, it's right there.

22:30.999 --> 22:34.999
- Found it?
- So gross.

22:34.999 --> 22:36.999
I can't.
Norman.

22:45.999 --> 22:49.999
Kourtney, you are so
little and cute.

22:49.999 --> 22:52.999
Oh, photo shoot central.
Oh!

22:52.999 --> 22:55.999
- The burgundy beauty is here?
- That's so funny.

22:55.999 --> 22:57.999
Ooh, you're very
geisha with that pony all of a

22:57.999 --> 22:59.999
sudden.
Can I take a picture with you

22:59.999 --> 23:01.999
- please?
- Okay, do you have a

23:01.999 --> 23:03.999
watering thing?
I could be watering.

23:03.999 --> 23:05.999
I'm sure I do.
Do we want a flash or no flash?

23:05.999 --> 23:07.999
- You're the queen.
- I'm gonna do a flash

23:07.999 --> 23:09.999
- at first.
- It's so cute.

23:09.999 --> 23:11.999
Isn't... Look how cute
she is-- are you joking?!

23:11.999 --> 23:14.999
Water the plants.
Should we do a little...?

23:14.999 --> 23:16.999
Oh, yeah!
Damn, beauty, your calf muscle

23:16.999 --> 23:20.999
is really on point.
That's super cute, no?

23:20.999 --> 23:21.999
- Do you want more?
- No.

23:21.999 --> 23:24.000
- Okay, we got it.
- No wasting water

23:24.000 --> 23:25.999
now.
Should I... Does your... any

23:25.999 --> 23:28.999
- plants really need some water?
- I'm sure.

23:28.999 --> 23:31.999
So does Mom know that
we're going to the ESPYs?

23:31.999 --> 23:34.999
So my sisters and I made the
decision that we're gonna go to

23:34.999 --> 23:38.000
the ESPYs for Kendall and Kylie,
but I can only imagine how hard

23:38.000 --> 23:41.999
it's gonna be for my mom, so I
just want to make sure that

23:41.999 --> 23:45.999
she's okay with all of us going
to support Caitlyn.

23:45.999 --> 23:49.999
Oh, look how gorgeous

23:49.999 --> 23:51.999
- she looks!
- Hey.

23:51.999 --> 23:53.999
Look.
Oh, my God!

23:53.999 --> 23:55.999
No, I was referring to
you.

23:55.999 --> 23:57.999
- Oh.
- So are you...?

23:57.999 --> 24:00.999
What did you call to
yell at me about today?

24:00.999 --> 24:03.999
- Not yelling today, KJ.
- You actually might be

24:03.999 --> 24:06.999
- the one doing the yelling.
- Oh, boy, what's going

24:06.999 --> 24:09.999
- on?
- Um, Kourt, Kim and I

24:09.999 --> 24:15.999
are going to the ESPYs tomorrow.♪ ♪

24:15.999 --> 24:18.999
- Beautiful.
- I agreed to do the

24:18.999 --> 24:20.999
- cover shoot.
- This is, like, your best

24:20.999 --> 24:22.999
- shoot ever.
- Keeks.

24:22.999 --> 24:24.999
That is
everything.

24:24.999 --> 24:26.999
There's a ton of
people on set.

24:26.999 --> 24:29.999
- It's weird to do that.
- What's going on with

24:29.999 --> 24:31.000
Scott?
Has he seen the kids?

24:31.000 --> 24:32.999
He'll come over
today.

24:32.999 --> 24:40.999
He's going to be in our lives.
So just a heads-up.

24:40.999 --> 24:42.999
What did you call to
yell at me about today?

24:42.999 --> 24:45.999
You actually might be
the one doing the yelling.

24:45.999 --> 24:54.999
Um, Kourt, Kim and I
are going to the ESPYs tomorrow.

24:54.999 --> 24:56.999
I think that you
showing up at all is amazing.

24:56.999 --> 24:58.999
- Yeah...
- And I think that that's

24:58.999 --> 25:02.999
- nice, 'cause this is her moment.
- Are we going to the

25:02.999 --> 25:04.999
after-party?
There's, like, a dinner...

25:04.999 --> 25:06.999
I think that's a
little much.

25:06.999 --> 25:09.999
Do you want to go to dinner with
Kourt, Kim and I after?

25:09.999 --> 25:12.999
Uh, I certainly would,
if that's what you guys were

25:12.999 --> 25:15.999
- gonna do.
- My mom actually took

25:15.999 --> 25:18.999
it really well.
She seems okay and is supportive

25:18.999 --> 25:20.999
about everything.
But we definitely all want to

25:20.999 --> 25:24.999
take her to dinner after the
ESPYs to show our support for

25:24.999 --> 25:26.999
- her as well.
- So just let me know

25:26.999 --> 25:29.999
- where you guys want to go.
- Okay, we'll figure it

25:29.999 --> 25:32.999
- out.
- Uh, look at this pose

25:32.999 --> 25:34.999
she's doing.

25:34.999 --> 25:36.999
- Okay.
- All right, crazy.

25:44.999 --> 25:50.999
Nice to see you.
Thanks for having me, guys.

25:50.999 --> 25:53.999
- Is Kim coming?
- Yeah, she just, like,

25:53.999 --> 25:55.999
forced me to do this.
She was like, "You're gonna get

25:55.999 --> 25:57.999
naked."
I've had, like, anxiety... to do

25:57.999 --> 25:59.999
this  shoot.
Kim is right.

25:59.999 --> 26:02.999
I am really proud of the
progress I've made.

26:02.999 --> 26:08.999
I want to embrace my body and my
curves, so I agreed to do the

26:08.999 --> 26:11.999
cover shoot, and I am
very, very, very nervous.

26:11.999 --> 26:16.999
It's just scary that I'm putting
myself on a magazine cover, and

26:16.999 --> 26:18.999
then I'm just letting the world
judge me.

26:18.999 --> 26:20.999
I really do feel a lot of
pressure.

26:20.999 --> 26:22.999
She can just move
around in that area, but I

26:22.999 --> 26:24.999
definitely want to get the room
in the foreground.

26:24.999 --> 26:27.999
- All right. Okay.
- Hi, Chloe, nice to see

26:27.999 --> 26:29.999
- you.
- We're super-excited.

26:29.999 --> 26:31.999
Oh, we're excited too.
I said "we're excited," but it's

26:31.999 --> 26:34.999
- just me.
- Do you want to jump

26:34.999 --> 26:36.999
- in for a shot?
- Yeah.

26:38.999 --> 26:41.999
Sexy, baby, sexy.
That's gorgeous.

26:41.999 --> 26:47.999
Yes, love that.
Ooh, that is everything.

26:47.999 --> 26:50.999
- Damn!
- That looks so good.

26:50.999 --> 26:53.999
No!
It's horrible.

26:53.999 --> 26:55.999
I don't wear bikinis.
I'm not that girl.

26:55.999 --> 26:57.999
I'm, like, a one-piece girl, and
this is not that.

26:57.999 --> 27:00.999
These are, like, high-waisted
shorts going up my ass.

27:00.999 --> 27:03.999
There's a ton of  people
on set, watching you.

27:03.999 --> 27:06.999
You're basically naked.
Now my white bra is watered down

27:06.999 --> 27:09.999
so you see my tits.
It just, it's weird.

27:09.999 --> 27:11.999
All right, y'all
ready to change?

27:11.999 --> 27:16.000
- Okay! Next one.
- Khlo, how are you?

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
I don't feel
comfortable in my body.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.999
- I don't want to do this.
- You seriously look so

27:20.999 --> 27:22.999
amazing.
Like, in my life, I've never

27:22.999 --> 27:25.999
- seen such a hotter bod.
- Keeks.

27:25.999 --> 27:28.999
- Your hair looks to die.
- It's soaking wet.

27:28.999 --> 27:29.999
Your makeup looks to
die.

27:29.999 --> 27:31.999
- Thank you.
- Clothes are to die.

27:31.999 --> 27:33.999
This is, like, your best shoot
ever.

27:33.999 --> 27:35.999
This look I'm not sure
about, just, like, the shorts,

27:35.999 --> 27:39.999
- but we will make it work.
- That's great.

27:39.999 --> 27:41.999
This is, like, the best
Khloe's ever looked.

27:41.999 --> 27:44.999
This is her first, like, sexy
shoot.

27:44.999 --> 27:45.999
- Really?
- Yeah, she's never done a

27:45.999 --> 27:48.999
sexy shoot before.
Khloe looks amazing.

27:48.999 --> 27:52.999
Her body is so on point, and I'm
so proud of her.

27:52.999 --> 27:54.999
She's not comfortable in the
sexy role, but I'm like, "You're

27:54.999 --> 27:57.999
so hot.
It is time.

27:57.999 --> 28:03.999
Like, you have to."
You look amazing.

28:03.999 --> 28:13.999
That  is so
hot.

28:13.999 --> 28:16.999
- I think we got it.
- We got it, we got it.

28:16.999 --> 28:19.999
That is the most beautiful body

28:19.999 --> 28:21.999
I have ever seen.
Sorry, girls.

28:21.999 --> 28:22.999
Don't butter me up
now.

28:22.999 --> 28:24.999
- No, really.
- Ah, that's the cover

28:24.999 --> 28:26.999
- right there.
- We're gonna be on so

28:26.999 --> 28:28.999
many jail cells it's gonna be
ridiculous.

28:28.999 --> 28:31.999
I am definitely happy that I did

28:31.999 --> 28:35.999
shoot, and I'm
really happy with how it turned

28:35.999 --> 28:38.999
out, and I'm really happy that
Kim forced me to do it.

28:38.999 --> 28:40.999
I never would have done this if
it wasn't for Kim.

28:40.999 --> 28:42.999
I never would have pushed
myself, just because I would've

28:42.999 --> 28:45.999
been too scared.
Thanks, Kim.

28:45.999 --> 28:47.999
My best advice to you,

28:47.999 --> 28:50.999
drive anywhere, get doughnuts.
Get ice cream.

28:50.999 --> 28:53.999
Get whatever you want and pig
out all night long.

28:53.999 --> 28:56.999
Why is that okay?
I want to so badly, so why are

28:56.999 --> 28:58.999
- you encouraging that?
- I mean, I'm about to

28:58.999 --> 29:08.999
drive to Krispy Kreme.

29:08.999 --> 29:11.999
Hi, bubba.
Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi!

29:11.999 --> 29:15.999
- Don't you dare throw up on me.
- What's all that

29:15.999 --> 29:17.999
- banging?
- They're finishing up

29:17.999 --> 29:19.999
the doors downstairs.
I'm gonna turn Kendall's bedroom

29:19.999 --> 29:22.999
into a closet.
I just have stuff in every

29:22.999 --> 29:26.999
closet of every single room, and
I just want it all in one place.

29:26.999 --> 29:29.999
You sound like the
farmer who built bigger barns

29:29.999 --> 29:32.999
instead of giving away his extra
crops.

29:32.999 --> 29:35.000
Your closet is so much
bigger than mine.

29:35.000 --> 29:38.999
What do you think?

29:38.999 --> 29:40.999
So, what's going on with Scott?
Has he seen the kids?

29:40.999 --> 29:43.999
Mm-hmm.
I'm sure he'll come over today

29:43.999 --> 29:47.999
and see them.
While we go to the ESPYs, I told

29:47.999 --> 29:51.999
Scott that he can come over to
see the kids.

29:51.999 --> 29:56.999
We're trying the best that we
can to be a team, living apart.

29:56.999 --> 29:59.999
- Has anything changed?
- Not really.

29:59.999 --> 30:03.999
We're just being cool for the
kids.

30:03.999 --> 30:05.999
'Cause I don't want you
to, you know...

30:05.999 --> 30:08.999
I just want to make sure that
it's fine with you, 'cause I

30:08.999 --> 30:13.999
really do genuinely care about
him and love him, but I want him

30:13.999 --> 30:18.999
to know that, at the same time,
he still has to take

30:18.999 --> 30:21.999
- responsibility.
- He's going to be in

30:21.999 --> 30:25.999
our lives.
We have three kids together.

30:25.999 --> 30:29.999
- So just, heads up.
- What are you wearing?

30:29.999 --> 30:31.999
We're going to the
ESPYs to support Caitlyn.

30:31.999 --> 30:33.999
I know that Kendall is
especially nervous.

30:33.999 --> 30:35.999
- Kylie!
- It's not necessary to

30:35.999 --> 30:37.999
- borrow my!
- You're just,

30:37.999 --> 30:40.999
literally, the biggest
bitch I've ever met.

30:40.999 --> 30:42.999
- Uh, touché.
- Ladies and

30:42.999 --> 30:44.999
- gentlemen, Caitlyn Jenner.
- I've always been

30:44.999 --> 30:46.999
really protective of my dad.
I don't want her to be scared or

30:46.999 --> 30:48.999
nervous.
That alone makes me really

30:48.999 --> 30:50.999
nervous.

30:59.000 --> 31:00.999
What are you wearing?
The white?

31:00.999 --> 31:02.999
No.
I'm wearing this.

31:02.999 --> 31:05.999
You're gonna look so
hot.

31:05.999 --> 31:08.999
Is everybody
going tonight?

31:08.999 --> 31:10.999
The sisters, her kids,
then we're going to dinner with

31:10.999 --> 31:13.999
- my mom afterwards.
- Tonight we're going

31:13.999 --> 31:16.999
to the ESPYs to support Caitlyn
and really, also, for Kendall

31:16.999 --> 31:19.999
and Kylie.
I know that Kendall is

31:19.999 --> 31:23.999
especially nervous for Caitlyn.
She's just worried, what if

31:23.999 --> 31:25.999
Caitlyn gets booed, what if
people aren't supportive?

31:25.999 --> 31:29.999
And I totally get it.
I'm exactly the same way.

31:29.999 --> 31:31.999
- You ready?
- Yeah, ready.

31:31.999 --> 31:33.999
They're closing the
doors at 6:00.

31:33.999 --> 31:36.999
Love you, thank you.

31:40.999 --> 31:42.999
Do you feel like my
boobs are lopsided?

31:42.999 --> 31:45.999
What?
You look beautiful.

31:45.999 --> 31:48.999
- I look so ugly.
- You look gorgeous.

31:48.999 --> 31:50.999
I mean, your makeup and hair is
stunning.

31:50.999 --> 31:52.999
- The dress is pretty.
- Do I look, like, huge

31:52.999 --> 31:55.999
- and fat on my back, though?
- Kim, you're pregnant.

31:55.999 --> 31:57.999
Embrace it.
You're talking to a woman who's

31:57.999 --> 32:00.000
nervous about having her
ex-husband on television any

32:00.000 --> 32:04.999
moment wearing a dress.
I'm really proud of all my kids

32:04.999 --> 32:06.999
for the way that they've shown
their love for Caitlyn, but I've

32:06.999 --> 32:11.999
decided to sit this one out.
I haven't met Caitlyn yet, and I

32:11.999 --> 32:17.999
feel like it would be so awkward
to meet her under these

32:17.999 --> 32:20.999
circumstances.
Turn around. Let...

32:20.999 --> 32:22.999
- What?
- Just put your hand,

32:22.999 --> 32:25.999
Kim, your hand to your side,
hand to your side.

32:25.999 --> 32:29.999
Okay, I think that looks
better that this is down.

32:29.999 --> 32:31.000
Kim, we're going in
there at 6:00.

32:31.000 --> 32:33.999
We're not gonna
make it, so we should go if

32:33.999 --> 32:35.999
you're not ready.
You look really fab.

32:35.999 --> 32:36.999
You're great.
It's perfect.

32:36.999 --> 32:38.999
- Okay, I have my phone.
- You're good. Bye.

32:38.999 --> 32:39.999
- Bye.
- Bye, guys.

32:39.999 --> 32:41.000
Love you, guys.
See you at dinner.

32:41.000 --> 32:44.999
You look so good, Khlo.
Khloe, so stunning.

32:44.999 --> 32:47.999
- Thanks.
- Have fun, girls.

32:47.999 --> 32:56.999
I love you.
See you at dinner.

32:56.999 --> 32:58.999
- Is Kendall ready?
- Almost.

32:58.999 --> 33:00.999
- Awesome.
- She's not taking any

33:00.999 --> 33:02.999
- of my clothes, right?
- Just one brown

33:02.999 --> 33:05.999
- random dress.
- She can't wear that.

33:05.999 --> 33:07.999
That's one of my favorite brown
dresses, so just take it out of

33:07.999 --> 33:09.999
her bag.
It's not hers.

33:09.999 --> 33:11.999
Kylie, I can't
borrow this?

33:11.999 --> 33:13.999
No, that's one of my
favorite dresses.

33:13.999 --> 33:15.999
I'm not going to
dinner like this.

33:15.999 --> 33:17.999
- I can't sit.
- So you can have

33:17.999 --> 33:19.999
someone go grab clothes from
your house.

33:19.999 --> 33:21.999
Why would you want to wear
something from my closet when

33:21.999 --> 33:22.999
- you can...
- Because I can't.

33:22.999 --> 33:24.999
We're going straight from the
show.

33:24.999 --> 33:26.000
Yes, you can have
someone drop  off.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.999
No! Kylie!
It's just annoying, 'cause this

33:28.999 --> 33:30.999
night is already stressful as it
is.

33:30.999 --> 33:32.999
I really want to just show that
we support our dad, so we don't

33:32.999 --> 33:34.999
need to be fighting over
outfits.

33:34.999 --> 33:36.999
I mean, maybe that's why we're
fighting over something so

33:36.999 --> 33:40.999
- stupid, but sisters.
- You know, it is not

33:40.999 --> 33:42.999
- necessary to borrow my.
- You're just,

33:42.999 --> 33:44.999
literally, the biggest
bitch I've ever met.

33:44.999 --> 33:49.999
Uh, touché.
Bye, children.

33:49.999 --> 33:55.999
I'm sorry your mom
is such a.

33:55.999 --> 33:57.999
Wait, is Dad mad at you guys,
too?

33:57.999 --> 34:00.999
Dad and Mom put me and Kylie
into, like, this weird position

34:00.999 --> 34:18.999
of choosing between them.
Dad wouldn't talk to me.

34:18.999 --> 34:20.999

34:35.999 --> 34:37.999
No, the pilgrims
died.

34:37.999 --> 34:39.999
Oh, I think it's
pilgrims died.

34:39.999 --> 34:41.999
It says "land of

Why did I think of this song?

34:54.999 --> 34:58.999
Um, Scott cancels on another
club.

34:58.999 --> 35:01.999
Hmm.
Interesting.

35:01.999 --> 35:03.999
- How was it today?
- Um, he is at the

35:03.999 --> 35:05.999
- house.
- Oh, no way.

35:05.999 --> 35:08.999
- He is there now.
- Were the kids excited?

35:08.999 --> 35:11.999
- So excited.
- How long is he gonna

35:11.999 --> 35:13.999
- stay there for?
- I don't know.

35:13.999 --> 35:15.999
I don't mind if he puts Mase to
bed, 'cause that's what he's

35:15.999 --> 35:18.999
been talking about, and we'll be
home after that.

35:18.999 --> 35:20.999
I just hope that we can get
along and, like, co-parent and

35:20.999 --> 35:25.999
not have to deal with anything
else.

35:25.999 --> 35:27.999
I know this is a really
hard time for Kourtney, and I

35:27.999 --> 35:31.999
want her to do whatever she has
to do for the family.

35:31.999 --> 35:34.999
But Kourtney has to be really
careful, because Scott always

35:34.999 --> 35:37.999
thinks of something to weasel
his way back in.

35:37.999 --> 35:40.999
So I hope that, you know, this
time it's gonna be different,

35:40.999 --> 35:42.999
'cause I want Kourtney to be
strong and not get back together

35:42.999 --> 35:44.999
- with him.
- You guys better hide

35:44.999 --> 35:47.999
my back fat.
Better hide my face.

35:47.999 --> 35:49.999
Can't believe I'm in this
outfit, I can't believe I'm in

35:49.999 --> 35:51.999
- this car.
- It's so fab.

35:51.999 --> 35:54.999
- The best part is your outfit.
- What are you shaking

35:54.999 --> 35:57.999
your head for?
I can't control my nipples.

36:01.999 --> 36:04.999
Kendall, turn your
head, please!

36:04.999 --> 36:08.999
Khloe! Khloe!

36:08.999 --> 36:11.999
Tonight is much
bigger than me and Kylie's

36:11.999 --> 36:14.000
little sister drama, so Kylie
and I decided to do the carpet

36:14.000 --> 36:16.999
together.
I've always been really

36:16.999 --> 36:18.999
protective of my dad.
I don't want her to be scared or

36:18.999 --> 36:21.999
nervous or anything.
That alone makes me really

36:21.999 --> 36:24.999
nervous.

36:24.999 --> 36:26.999
Ladies and
gentlemen, Caitlyn Jenner.

36:31.999 --> 36:34.999
Everyone is so
supportive of Caitlyn.

36:34.999 --> 36:39.999
And it is so amazing to see her
walking up there in heels in

36:39.999 --> 36:43.999
- front of all of these people.
- Thank you so much.

36:43.999 --> 36:47.999
I know the people in this room
have respect for hard work.

36:47.999 --> 36:51.999
I trained hard, but this
transition has been harder on me

36:51.999 --> 36:54.999
than anything I could imagine.
I always wanted my children to

36:54.999 --> 36:57.999
be so proud of their dad for
what he was able to accomplish

36:57.999 --> 37:00.999
in his life.
You guys have given me so much

37:00.999 --> 37:02.999
support.
I am so grateful to have all of

37:02.999 --> 37:05.999
you in my life.
Thank you.

37:10.999 --> 37:15.999
I think what my dad is
doing now is so amazing.

37:15.999 --> 37:18.999
I feel like this is the reason
she's on the planet.

37:18.999 --> 37:21.999
To bring awareness and
everyone's watching her and what

37:21.999 --> 37:24.999
she's doing, so I think it's
really, really awesome that

37:24.999 --> 37:27.999
- she's doing this.
- Thank you so much

37:27.999 --> 37:30.999
for this honor, thank you.

37:30.999 --> 37:32.999
My dad's speech was
beautiful.

37:32.999 --> 37:34.999
I think that this is a really
huge step for everyone to

37:34.999 --> 37:37.999
process the transition and it's
great that while my sisters were

37:37.999 --> 37:50.999
all here to support her and I
love seeing my dad happy.

37:50.999 --> 37:53.999
- Hey, Mom.
- Hi.

37:53.999 --> 37:56.999
- Nice dress!
Thank-thank you.

37:56.999 --> 37:59.999
- How are you?
- You guys looked so

37:59.999 --> 38:02.999
beautiful on the red carpet.
The gold mermaid dress?

38:02.999 --> 38:05.999
That's, like, one of the
all-time greatest dresses I've

38:05.999 --> 38:07.999
ever seen.
That was so good--

38:07.999 --> 38:09.999
It was insane in the
sunlight, too.

38:09.999 --> 38:12.999
- It was, like, 20 times better.
- Yeah, you looked like a

38:12.999 --> 38:14.999
little Academy Award statue.
The gold dress, the black dress,

38:14.999 --> 38:16.999
you looked beautiful--
How did you think his

38:16.999 --> 38:21.999
- speech was?
- I thought it was, um--

38:21.999 --> 38:23.999
- Did you watch it?
- Yes, I did.

38:23.999 --> 38:27.999
I thought she did a really good
job with the speech.

38:27.999 --> 38:30.999
- Yeah, really beautiful.
- I started crying

38:30.999 --> 38:32.999
before she went on.
Before we even walked out to sit

38:32.999 --> 38:34.999
down.
I was nervous she was nervous.

38:34.999 --> 38:37.999
I was thinking that
would be so scary.

38:37.999 --> 38:42.999
And such a big responsibility.
Caitlyn gave an amazing speech.

38:42.999 --> 38:46.999
It was very brave of her to come
out on national television, live

38:46.999 --> 38:51.999
in front of millions of people.
Think she did a good job.

38:51.999 --> 38:53.999
- What did you guys think?
- Great.

38:53.999 --> 38:55.999
- Yeah.
- The outfit was

38:55.999 --> 38:57.999
- great and the speech was great.
- You look pretty

38:57.999 --> 39:00.999
- tonight.
- Do I normally not?

39:00.999 --> 39:02.999
Well, you've been
looking really cute lately.

39:02.999 --> 39:04.999
You kind of came out of your
"I'm not gonna get a wax or get

39:04.999 --> 39:07.999
dressed" phase.
And I'm really proud of you.

39:07.999 --> 39:12.999
Like my old Kourtney's back.
This has been a year of a lot of

39:12.999 --> 39:17.999
change for my family and we're
all going through our own thing

39:17.999 --> 39:21.999
kind of at the same time.
Tonight was a really big night

39:21.999 --> 39:24.999
for Caitlyn, but it means so
much to me that they wanted to

39:24.999 --> 39:28.999
have dinner with me after and
make sure I was okay.

39:28.999 --> 39:33.999
The way that they've shown such
incredible love and kindness and

39:33.999 --> 39:38.999
acceptance-- they're amazing
kids.

39:38.999 --> 39:40.999
You know what's really cute--
that picture you posted of you

39:40.999 --> 39:42.999
- watering Khloe's plants.
Mm-hmm.

39:42.999 --> 39:44.999
I was acting.
I wasn't really watering.

39:44.999 --> 39:46.999
Please don't burst my
bubble.

39:46.999 --> 39:48.999
I was watering
them.

39:48.999 --> 39:56.999
Thank you.♪ ♪

39:56.999 --> 39:59.999
So, we were sitting
outside and we were looking at

39:59.999 --> 40:02.999
the stars and the moon and I was
saying that there's the North

40:02.999 --> 40:05.999
Star, and I said, "Look, there's
the North Star," and she goes,

40:05.999 --> 40:10.999
"And, uh, P star, Mason star."
And I said, "No, there's only a

40:10.999 --> 40:13.999
North Star.
P doesn't have a star--"

40:13.999 --> 40:15.999
Why are you putting ChapStick
all over you?

40:15.999 --> 40:17.999
Wait, is Dad mad at
you guys, too, for not going to

40:17.999 --> 40:24.999
her after-party thing?
When we went to dinner with Mom?

40:24.999 --> 40:26.999
- No.
- She asked me--

40:26.999 --> 40:28.999
I didn't even know about it till
the day of.

40:28.999 --> 40:31.999
And then she came up to me after
the ESPYs and was like, "Are

40:31.999 --> 40:33.999
you coming?"
And I was like, "We've already

40:33.999 --> 40:35.999
planned to go to dinner with
Mom, I didn't know your thing

40:35.999 --> 40:37.999
was happening."
And it's so weird 'cause Dad and

40:37.999 --> 40:40.999
Mom put me especially me and
Kylie into, like, this weird

40:40.999 --> 40:42.999
position of, like, choosing
between them.

40:42.999 --> 40:44.999
I felt really bad about not
going to dinner with my dad and

40:44.999 --> 40:48.999
going to dinner with my mom,
but I also want to be

40:48.999 --> 40:52.999
supportive of my mom, um, with
what she's going through.

40:52.999 --> 40:54.999
So I feel like I'm stuck in a
really awkward position.

40:54.999 --> 40:56.999
Dad wouldn't talk to me.

41:04.999 --> 41:06.999
Dad wouldn't talk to
me.

41:06.999 --> 41:08.999
That's so wrong
to do to you.

41:08.999 --> 41:10.999
- Right?
- We asked her to go to

41:10.999 --> 41:12.999
- dinner, so that was our problem?
- I think we probably

41:12.999 --> 41:14.999
made the situation--
Kylie and I were

41:14.999 --> 41:16.999
just rolling with the flow.
We didn't know what to do.

41:16.999 --> 41:18.999
Yeah, I think we made
that situation 'cause--

41:18.999 --> 41:20.999
'Cause we decided
we didn't want to go to the

41:20.999 --> 41:23.000
after-party.
In the moment, I felt bad.

41:23.000 --> 41:25.999
I felt like we should've gone to
the after-party.

41:25.999 --> 41:27.999
I think it was just so
and we

41:27.999 --> 41:29.999
thought, like--
Yeah.

41:29.999 --> 41:32.999
We, at some point, we
had to make a stand for Mom.

41:32.999 --> 41:34.999
Did it make Mom feel so much
better?

41:34.999 --> 41:37.999
- Yes, I think it did.
- Kendall is doing

41:37.999 --> 41:41.999
the absolute best she can to be
supportive and understand this

41:41.999 --> 41:44.999
whole thing, you know, we
planned this dinner with my mom,

41:44.999 --> 41:47.999
thinking that that was the right
thing to do, but Caitlyn is not

41:47.999 --> 41:50.999
happy with us.
Like, there's nothing we can do

41:50.999 --> 41:53.999
about it now and we're just
doing the best that we can to be

41:53.999 --> 41:56.999
supportive.

41:56.999 --> 41:58.999
You know my, you know my
baby is due right near your

41:58.999 --> 42:01.999
birthday.
What should we name the new

42:01.999 --> 42:03.999
- baby?
- Preston.

42:03.999 --> 42:06.999
Preston?
What about--?

42:06.999 --> 42:12.999
- Preston Dollar!
- Preston Dollar West?

42:12.999 --> 42:15.999
Your imagination is wild.

42:18.999 --> 42:21.999
Keeping Up with
the Kardashians...

42:21.999 --> 42:24.999
I just went over my
house stuff.

42:24.999 --> 42:26.999
Guess who has to move out?
Do you want a roommate?

42:26.999 --> 42:29.999
- Oh, my God.
- Mom is not denying

42:29.999 --> 42:31.999
- that Corey's her boyfriend now.
- Oh, really?

42:31.999 --> 42:33.999
How much do you miss
me?

42:33.999 --> 42:35.999
A lot.
Is that my car?

42:35.999 --> 42:37.999
- That's your car.
- You're so cute.

42:37.999 --> 42:39.999
No matter what, I'll
be taking care of you.

42:39.999 --> 42:42.999
- You're always gonna be my baby.
- Okay.

42:42.999 --> 42:44.999
Kourtney, I find you
very beautiful.

42:44.999 --> 42:46.999
- Thank you.
- I just don't think

42:46.999 --> 42:49.999
Kourtney realizes how bomb she
is right now.

42:49.999 --> 42:51.999
- Wow, hot damn.
- Let's not shoot my

42:51.999 --> 42:53.999
- vagina.
- Where's Khloe?

42:53.999 --> 42:55.999
She's obsessed with
working out.

42:55.999 --> 42:57.999
She's taking it to a whole new
level.

42:57.999 --> 42:59.999
- She has arrived.
- I'm back!

42:59.999 --> 43:01.999
I would like to have a toast to
my little daughter turning 18

43:01.999 --> 43:04.999
- years old.
- Yay!

43:04.999 --> 43:06.999
- Is that Kylie's name?
- What, here? Oh, yeah.

43:06.999 --> 43:08.999
I was really looking
forward to this trip to hang out

43:08.999 --> 43:10.999
- with you.
- What's the deal with

43:10.999 --> 43:12.999
- Kylie?
- She doesn't have her

43:12.999 --> 43:14.999
priorities straight and I tell
everyone that.

43:14.999 --> 43:17.999
There's elevated
blood pressure.

43:17.999 --> 43:19.999
- I really hope it's not diabetes.
- I'm, like, actually

43:19.999 --> 43:21.999
- scared.
- Your life is at stake.

43:21.999 --> 43:24.999
I have your results
on my desk here...

43:24.999 --> 43:26.999
With Scott, do you think
you would ever forgive him and

43:26.999 --> 43:29.999
- get back with him?
- You say I don't have

43:29.999 --> 43:33.999
a family and then we give you
one-- why do you destroy it?

43:33.999 --> 43:36.999
I made the worst
decision I could've ever made in

43:36.999 --> 43:39.999
my life.
It's just a situation I'd never

43:39.999 --> 43:41.999
- thought I'd be in.
- But guess what, you can

43:41.999 --> 43:43.999
make it better.
