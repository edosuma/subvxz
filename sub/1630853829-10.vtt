Yeah.

03:18.296 --> 03:19.933
We need it to go to California.

03:19.966 --> 03:23.406
California.

03:23.439 --> 03:25.512
Wow.

03:28.684 --> 03:30.855
The code is 1831.

03:30.888 --> 03:33.660
The year Sitting Bull was born.

03:40.675 --> 03:42.579
...it's been a weird
last few days.

03:42.612 --> 03:44.817
Pay what you owe when the time

03:44.850 --> 03:46.987
is right, in this lifetime

03:47.020 --> 03:49.660
or the next.
And if in the next,

03:49.693 --> 03:51.897
I'm a horse,
you can pay me in oats.

03:51.930 --> 03:53.868

03:53.901 --> 03:55.037
milk me gently.

03:55.070 --> 03:57.676
Safe travels, Elora Danan,

03:57.709 --> 04:00.380
and your elvish friend.

04:00.413 --> 04:03.420
I shouldn't say elvish,
it's just the blonde hair.

04:03.453 --> 04:05.457
I'm assuming
it's not natural, but...

04:05.490 --> 04:07.294
I shouldn't assume,
it-it could be.

04:07.327 --> 04:10.067
Sometimes, the roots
go from dark to blonde.

04:10.100 --> 04:12.839
Just be safe out there.
Use your blinker.

04:12.872 --> 04:14.909
Potholes are the devil.

04:18.918 --> 04:20.955
Oh, there they are.

04:22.725 --> 04:24.830

Yeah, this is it.

04:38.757 --> 04:40.862
Hey, streets is hard out there.

04:40.895 --> 04:43.768
- Don't get shot up.
- For real.

04:43.801 --> 04:45.538
Man, we almost
got shot up out there.

04:45.571 --> 04:46.974
Word?

04:47.007 --> 04:48.778
Yeah, we just hid
behind the tall people.

04:48.811 --> 04:50.515
- Hey, you got
your medicines?

04:50.548 --> 04:52.351
- You already know.
- For sure.

04:52.384 --> 04:55.090
Remember, gluten-free
just means no bread.

04:55.123 --> 04:58.531
And don't eat the barbecue
unless it's Korean.

04:58.564 --> 04:59.866
And, uh, don't buy
farmers market sage.

04:59.899 --> 05:01.904
- Mm.
- It give you bad luck,

05:01.937 --> 05:04.075
- stinky pits, and foot fungus.
- Yeah.

05:04.108 --> 05:06.412
- Okay.
- And let your boys know
if you get caught up,

05:06.445 --> 05:07.816
we got lots
of friends out there.

05:07.849 --> 05:09.085
Hey, um,

05:10.821 --> 05:13.426
Safer than we were.

05:13.459 --> 05:14.963
For real.

05:15.998 --> 05:17.768
Might actually
make it this time.

05:19.606 --> 05:22.010
We'll be back.

05:23.580 --> 05:24.749
Bet.

05:26.954 --> 05:29.125
- Later, fuckers.
Later, shitass.
- I'll see your shitass later.

- Oh, fuck!
- Ooh.

05:43.821 --> 05:45.157
That can't be good.

05:45.190 --> 05:47.427
Life's hard.

05:48.496 --> 05:50.534
One of the hardest.

06:11.208 --> 06:13.914
- Look at this little shitass.

06:15.584 --> 06:17.822
Yeah, it's just a straight shot

06:17.855 --> 06:21.429
- from here, right?
- Word. See that turn up there?

06:21.462 --> 06:23.634
Don't take it.

06:23.667 --> 06:25.904
Just go straight.
Follow the sun, bro.

06:27.975 --> 06:30.113
How long's it gonna take
for us to get there?

06:30.146 --> 06:32.084
Take a couple days.

06:32.117 --> 06:33.153
Shut your eyes, bro,

06:33.186 --> 06:35.692
and then we'll be there.

06:35.725 --> 06:37.996
Nah, I can't.
I'm too excited.

06:38.029 --> 06:39.533
Fuck, me too.

06:39.566 --> 06:42.071
Damn, man,
how crazy is it to know

06:42.104 --> 06:44.710
what Daniel was thinking
back then?

06:44.743 --> 06:46.079
- Shit.
- For real.

06:46.112 --> 06:47.949
Especially his unrequited love
for Elora.

06:47.982 --> 06:49.987
- That was a shock.

06:50.020 --> 06:52.792
- Little plot twist.
- Fuck you talking about?

06:52.825 --> 06:55.464
- Nothing ever even happened.
- Bro, come on, man.

06:55.497 --> 06:56.967
We all knew, bro.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.838
- Fuck yeah,
we knew.

06:58.871 --> 07:00.708
You didn't
fucking know anything.

07:00.741 --> 07:02.879
Come on.

07:02.912 --> 07:05.518
I didn't know.
I thought you guys were cousins.

07:05.551 --> 07:07.655
- Cousins.
- Uh, no.

07:07.688 --> 07:09.158
Only through marriage, bro.

07:09.191 --> 07:11.663
Not like they're
from the same clan or anything.

07:14.769 --> 07:16.740
Nah, but for real, though,

07:16.773 --> 07:18.978
I'm happy we're getting you
to Cali, man.

07:19.011 --> 07:20.682
It's not about me.

07:20.715 --> 07:22.519
-
We read that letter.
- Yeah.

07:22.552 --> 07:24.723
Daydreaming about you all day,

07:24.756 --> 07:27.662
- smiling at the ocean.
- It's not...
It's not about me,

07:27.695 --> 07:29.933
it's about all of us
going to Cali,

07:29.966 --> 07:32.839
together, for Daniel,
'cause he can't.

07:32.872 --> 07:35.545
- For the bro.
- Yeah.

07:35.578 --> 07:37.615
What are we gonna do
when we get out there?

07:37.648 --> 07:40.053
Go to the ocean, bro.
Haven't you been listening?

07:40.086 --> 07:41.790
Well, yeah, I know,
we're gonna go to the ocean,

07:41.823 --> 07:43.728
but, like, are we just
gonna sit there or...

07:43.761 --> 07:47.201
Why don't we just...
put this in the ocean?

07:47.234 --> 07:50.140
You know? Kind of like what
y'all did with Jackie's stuff.

07:50.173 --> 07:51.977
But that was to get rid
of something, though.

07:52.010 --> 07:55.016
Yeah, yeah, I-I know that,
but, like,

07:55.049 --> 07:58.624
this is kind of like
a piece of Daniel, you know?

07:58.657 --> 07:59.926
And, like, putting him
in the ocean

07:59.959 --> 08:01.529
is always something
he wanted to do.

08:03.199 --> 08:05.838
And after that,

08:05.871 --> 08:08.042
the world's our oyster.

08:08.075 --> 08:09.813
Whatever the fuck that means.

08:09.846 --> 08:12.217
Hm.

08:12.250 --> 08:14.088
- Good thinking, bro.
- Yeah.

- It's very intuitive.

08:17.294 --> 08:19.031
Young elder.

08:19.064 --> 08:21.503
What does an oyster mean, though?

08:22.672 --> 08:25.711
Like a...
another word for a clam.

08:25.744 --> 08:27.181
- Isn't it like,
- Is it really a clam?

08:27.214 --> 08:28.249
chips or something?

08:28.282 --> 08:30.053
The world's your Indian taco.

11:42.270 --> 11:44.141
Thank you.

11:44.174 --> 11:45.476
L.A. people are nice.

11:47.180 --> 11:48.449
Fuckin' A.

11:48.482 --> 11:51.255
- We're here.
- Fuck yeah, man.

11:51.288 --> 11:54.194
It's like you can
smell salt everywhere.

11:54.227 --> 11:55.330
Just your upper lip, bro.

11:55.363 --> 11:57.067
- Yeesh.

11:57.100 --> 11:58.771
We should eat quick

11:58.804 --> 12:00.808
and head to the beach
before the sun goes down.

12:00.841 --> 12:03.279
Or could we get a hotel room
tonight and

12:03.312 --> 12:05.016
sleep in a nice bed,

12:05.049 --> 12:06.820
you know? Get some rest,

12:06.853 --> 12:09.358
watch some TV, get a shower.

12:09.391 --> 12:11.495
Yeah, but, honestly,

12:11.529 --> 12:13.333
I think it's best if we just
slept inside the car.

12:13.366 --> 12:15.470
Like, save money.

12:15.504 --> 12:17.207
Yeah, won't be comfortable,

12:17.240 --> 12:19.311
but Bear's right.

12:20.981 --> 12:24.088
Well, fuck, you guys better not
be tearing rags all night.

12:24.121 --> 12:25.490
I sleep with my mouth open.

12:25.524 --> 12:28.363
- Yeah, Cheese.
- What-what's the...

12:28.396 --> 12:31.068
"chi-la-quil-ees"?

12:31.101 --> 12:32.805
"Chile roll-leno."

12:32.838 --> 12:34.942
We're by the ocean,
they got to have catfish, right?

12:43.025 --> 12:45.130
Oh, money's in the glove box.

12:45.163 --> 12:46.498
I'll go.

12:51.275 --> 12:54.180
- Wow, that's messed-up.
- Yeah.

13:01.228 --> 13:04.268
What the fuck?

13:04.301 --> 13:06.606
Fuck, man.
Like, that was literally

13:06.639 --> 13:09.546
- all of our money.
- The snacks.

13:09.579 --> 13:10.914
Fuck.

13:12.450 --> 13:13.954
Daniel's letter.

13:13.987 --> 13:15.624
Fuck.

13:15.657 --> 13:18.429
- Should we report it?

13:18.462 --> 13:20.568
No, we can't report it.

13:20.601 --> 13:22.972
If we do, they're gonna arrest
us and bring us back home.

13:23.005 --> 13:25.242
Gonna have to call your dad, Bear.

13:26.278 --> 13:28.149
I'm not calling my fucking dad.

13:28.182 --> 13:30.119
What else are we gonna do, Bear?

13:34.662 --> 13:36.499
Just let me think.

13:36.533 --> 13:38.236
Hurry up.
Fuck, who cares.

13:38.269 --> 13:40.908
Fine, fine.
Fuck it, fine.

13:40.941 --> 13:43.279
I'll just fucking
call this douchebag.

13:43.312 --> 13:45.016
<i>
You have reached a number</i>

13:45.049 --> 13:47.588
<i>that has been disconnected
or is no lon...</i>

13:47.621 --> 13:49.157
Disconnected.

13:51.596 --> 13:54.167
Just...
I can't do this shit.

13:56.205 --> 13:58.843
It's an unfortunate event,
what just happened here.

14:01.348 --> 14:03.152
White Jesus?

14:04.622 --> 14:05.925
Wait,

14:05.958 --> 14:07.327
you seen what happened?

14:07.360 --> 14:08.931
Yeah, man.

14:08.964 --> 14:10.567
Guys in suits.

14:11.569 --> 14:13.941
Gangsters or... Mormons.

14:13.974 --> 14:16.178
Gacked it.

14:16.211 --> 14:18.917
<i>Aho,</i> White Jesus,
which way's the beach?

14:20.186 --> 14:22.959
Mountains are uphill,
beach is down.

14:22.992 --> 14:26.031
Fair enough. Sko.

14:26.064 --> 14:29.471
You-you shan't go it alone.
Thy beach

14:29.505 --> 14:31.142
is ten miles from here.

14:31.175 --> 14:32.477
Thoust don't know what these

14:32.511 --> 14:34.882
L.A. neighborhoods are like.

14:36.084 --> 14:37.320
Made a promise to Daniel.

14:37.353 --> 14:40.493
I'm gonna see it through.

14:40.527 --> 14:42.296
Yeah, let's go, come on.

14:44.100 --> 14:45.971
Can you take us there?

14:46.004 --> 14:49.512
You would have me,
thy humble servant,

14:49.545 --> 14:51.448
guide thee to the beach?

14:51.481 --> 14:53.052
Yeah, sure.

14:53.085 --> 14:56.660
Let us go, then.

14:56.693 --> 14:58.396
- All right.
- Come on.

14:58.429 --> 14:59.532
He is the way.

14:59.565 --> 15:01.001
And the truth

15:01.034 --> 15:03.707
and the light.
Don't you forget it.

15:03.740 --> 15:05.644
You fucking serious?

15:05.677 --> 15:08.984
We're gonna go with White Jesus?

15:09.017 --> 15:10.521
- Yeah, bro.
- Yeah.

15:10.554 --> 15:12.959
Come, now.

15:12.992 --> 15:14.529
- Okay.
- Body of me?

15:14.562 --> 15:17.066
Say no more, man.

15:26.351 --> 15:28.122
Peace be with you.

15:28.155 --> 15:29.726
What's up, brothers and sisters?

15:29.759 --> 15:31.061
Greetings.

15:31.094 --> 15:32.765
Do you just know everyone here?

15:32.798 --> 15:36.405
For the most part.
My last place wasn't this nice.

15:36.438 --> 15:39.178
Watch out for Phillip,
he has a low blood sugar thing.

15:39.211 --> 15:41.348
It's a long story.
There's food everywhere.

15:41.381 --> 15:43.520
Salmon, cake.

15:46.559 --> 15:48.228
Watch thou step.

15:52.605 --> 15:56.045
Brothers.

15:56.078 --> 15:58.517
Brethren. Sistren.

15:58.550 --> 16:00.486
Yes.

16:00.520 --> 16:03.459
Here we are.

16:03.492 --> 16:07.133
Thoust can take the mattresses.
I prefer the hard ground.

16:07.166 --> 16:10.073
Uh, I do have a couple
of foldy chairs. You can

16:10.106 --> 16:12.511
figure out your
sleep situations. Um...

16:12.544 --> 16:16.218
I do have one toothbrush. Uh...

16:16.251 --> 16:18.456
It's kind of multipurpose,
but you're all welcome to it.

16:18.489 --> 16:19.792
Please, for the love
of all things holy,

16:19.825 --> 16:21.529
keep your hands off of my

16:21.562 --> 16:24.602
metal detector,
and, yes, come in.

16:24.635 --> 16:26.573
Come in to thine stable.

16:26.606 --> 16:29.077
Ah. Mm.

16:31.248 --> 16:33.219
Ah... All right.

16:33.252 --> 16:35.290
Hey.

16:35.323 --> 16:38.062
We can't just stop.
We kind of got to go

16:38.095 --> 16:39.330
to the beach.

16:42.638 --> 16:46.445
- We can't stay here.
- Fuck no, bro.
- I know, bro.

16:46.478 --> 16:49.084
Ah, you're far better off
here than you are

16:49.117 --> 16:51.254
out there on your own at night.

16:53.693 --> 16:56.600
Listen, the beach is five miles

16:56.633 --> 16:59.237
straight down this road.

16:59.270 --> 17:02.076
In the morning,
I'll take you there myself.

17:04.782 --> 17:06.553
Okay?

17:06.586 --> 17:07.754
Please.

17:10.359 --> 17:12.565
All right, yeah.
Fuck it, we'll stay.

17:12.598 --> 17:14.736
Just for the night, okay?

17:14.769 --> 17:17.742
We'll stand guard, all right?

17:17.775 --> 17:20.413
We'll take shifts.
Yeah?

17:20.446 --> 17:23.385
- Yeah.
- Okay.

17:30.634 --> 17:34.241
I mean, everyone
knows him for <i>Lost Boys,</i>

17:34.274 --> 17:37.280
but he did <i>Thunderdome,</i> too,
and he toured

17:37.313 --> 17:39.418
with Tina Turner for years.

17:39.451 --> 17:41.221
Is that the guy in the diaper?

17:41.254 --> 17:44.161
No, that's, um, Ton Ton Tattoo.

17:44.194 --> 17:47.267
Oh. Wait, so there's
two sax players

17:47.300 --> 17:49.539
- in <i>Thunderdome?</i>
- No, Tim Cappello

17:49.572 --> 17:51.543
wasn't in the movie.

17:51.576 --> 17:53.747
He-he just did the song
in the credits.

17:53.780 --> 17:57.219
Oh. Got it.

17:59.391 --> 18:01.563
Daniel showed me that movie.

18:01.596 --> 18:04.702
- Which one?
- Both, actually.

18:06.471 --> 18:08.108
Same.

18:08.943 --> 18:10.748
He was my hero, you know?

18:10.781 --> 18:13.219
Tim Cappello?

18:13.252 --> 18:15.390
No. Uh, Daniel.

18:15.423 --> 18:18.195
Um, it just seemed like
he could do anything, you know?

18:22.504 --> 18:25.176
Me too.

18:25.209 --> 18:27.113
I think the same about you,
you know?

18:28.550 --> 18:29.519
: Really?

18:29.552 --> 18:31.422
Yeah. I mean,

18:31.455 --> 18:33.192
it just seems like,
anytime we get into trouble,

18:33.225 --> 18:35.363
you just know what to do.

18:37.534 --> 18:39.539
That's fucking stupid, Cheese.

18:41.441 --> 18:44.716
I have no idea
what to do right now.

18:46.986 --> 18:49.324
If anyone can make it out,

18:49.357 --> 18:50.727
it'd be you.

18:54.668 --> 18:57.207
- LAPD! Let's go!

19:00.279 --> 19:02.217
Shit. Better get the fuck up.
Get the fuck up.

19:02.250 --> 19:04.321
- Fuck up.
- What the fuck's
going on?

19:04.354 --> 19:06.225
Mm, I was dreaming, bro.

19:06.258 --> 19:07.895
- Cops are here, bro.
- What?

19:07.928 --> 19:10.601
- Come on, we got to go.
- What... what time is it?

19:10.634 --> 19:12.437
- Oh, shit.

19:12.470 --> 19:15.343
- Move! Let's go! Go!

19:15.376 --> 19:16.646
Where's White Jesus?

19:16.679 --> 19:18.215
Fucking dipped out on us
hella long ago, bro.

19:18.248 --> 19:20.419
Uh, he'll forever
live on in our hearts.

19:30.874 --> 19:31.943
<i>
Guys,</i>

19:31.976 --> 19:33.780
I can't go any further.

19:33.813 --> 19:35.717
You guys go on without me.

19:35.750 --> 19:38.623
Fuck, Cheese, man. Come on, bro,
we're almost there.

19:38.656 --> 19:41.529
- You said that, like,
four hours ago, bro.

19:41.562 --> 19:43.966
Just admit it, you don't know
where we're going.

19:44.969 --> 19:47.006
We're just following
the directions

19:47.039 --> 19:49.945
- of White Jesus, Willie Jack.
- Yeah.

19:53.285 --> 19:54.622
The fuck?

19:54.655 --> 19:56.559
That motherfucker
was walking fast as shit.

19:56.592 --> 19:58.028
Can't stay here.

19:58.061 --> 19:59.532
Don't want to get picked up
by some white lady

19:59.565 --> 20:01.435
who likes ranch dressing
on her dinner rolls.

20:01.468 --> 20:03.907
Yeah. Exactly.

20:03.940 --> 20:07.648
Elora, you have some
really, really specific fears.

20:07.681 --> 20:08.950
Wait.

20:08.983 --> 20:10.687
What?

20:10.720 --> 20:13.794
- You guys hear that?

20:13.827 --> 20:14.928
Yo.

20:28.890 --> 20:32.297
It just... keeps going.

20:32.330 --> 20:34.969
It's like
a big-ass lake that never ends.

20:35.002 --> 20:36.639
Unreal.

20:46.792 --> 20:49.497
(sighs) Skoden.

22:51.474 --> 22:52.878
- Skoden.
- Ooh.

23:02.764 --> 23:04.067
Come on, bro.

23:04.100 --> 23:06.071
You got to put your feet
in the sand. Feel it.

23:06.104 --> 23:08.643
Nope.

23:08.676 --> 23:11.582
I know what we came here
to do, but...

23:13.051 --> 23:15.455
I don't want
to let him go, Bear.

23:19.197 --> 23:22.738
Hey.
Hey, Elora, we're not.

23:22.771 --> 23:25.142
It's...

23:25.175 --> 23:27.013
it's the pain.

23:27.046 --> 23:29.150
That's what we're letting go.

23:29.183 --> 23:31.020
It's got us stuck.

23:32.924 --> 23:34.628
Just imagine

23:34.661 --> 23:37.968
how happy Danny would be
seeing us live our lives.

23:38.001 --> 23:40.472
Finally in Cali.

23:56.839 --> 24:00.179
- Ready?
- Uh, yeah.

24:00.212 --> 24:02.016
Okay.

24:23.058 --> 24:25.730
What now? Without the letter?

24:27.667 --> 24:30.072
<i>She's a good girl ♪</i>

24:30.105 --> 24:33.680
<i>Loves some aunties ♪</i>

24:33.713 --> 24:37.621
<i>Loves White Jesus ♪</i>

24:37.654 --> 24:39.558
<i>And America, too... ♪</i>

24:39.591 --> 24:41.829
Hey, trust us, this works.

24:41.862 --> 24:45.904
<i>Loves her horses and... ♪</i>

24:45.937 --> 24:48.977
Fuck, I can't remember the rest.

24:49.010 --> 24:50.614
It's all good, bro.

24:50.647 --> 24:52.283
Hey, Cheese.

24:52.316 --> 24:55.122
Why don't you say a prayer?

24:55.155 --> 24:56.893
You're good at it.

24:56.926 --> 24:59.297
Little long, but...
go for it, bro.

24:59.330 --> 25:02.838
- You got this.
- Uh...

25:02.871 --> 25:03.973
Okay.

25:04.006 --> 25:06.010
Um, well...

25:07.948 --> 25:11.321
He/She...

25:11.354 --> 25:14.895
Hers/His/They...

25:14.928 --> 25:16.866
genderless being,

25:16.899 --> 25:20.139
we're here for
our friend Daniel.

25:20.172 --> 25:21.742
Um...

25:21.775 --> 25:24.313
well, we just wanted this moment
to be significant.

25:26.317 --> 25:28.756
Like in the movies.

25:28.789 --> 25:30.627
Like in <i>NeverEnding Story</i> when

25:30.660 --> 25:32.764
the wind blows down
to the basement, and

25:32.797 --> 25:33.900
Bastian realized
that he's been reading

25:33.933 --> 25:35.302
about himself, but, like,

25:35.335 --> 25:37.073
his inner-self
was actually Atreyu,

25:37.106 --> 25:38.075
- and...
- Cheese.

25:38.108 --> 25:39.945
Sorry.

25:39.978 --> 25:42.049
Keep going, bro.

25:44.053 --> 25:46.124
We didn't get to say goodbye
to you, Daniel.

25:47.828 --> 25:49.932
And, um...

25:49.965 --> 25:53.673
you know what?
To be honest, I've been...

25:53.706 --> 25:55.075
kind of mad at you.

25:57.948 --> 26:00.051
You're my hero, man.

26:02.223 --> 26:05.228
Now you're not here
to make things right or better.

26:07.266 --> 26:09.237
And Willie Jack,

26:09.270 --> 26:12.243
she cares for
her family members.

26:12.276 --> 26:14.648
And now she's lost a brother,

26:14.681 --> 26:16.819
cousin, friend.

26:18.956 --> 26:21.696
And Bear...

26:21.729 --> 26:24.067
he lost his best friend.

26:24.100 --> 26:27.808
Now, a whole piece
of him's missing.

26:27.841 --> 26:29.143
And Elora...

26:29.176 --> 26:32.216
she lost her hope.

26:32.249 --> 26:34.688
