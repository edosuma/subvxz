I'm shocked.

07:29.983 --> 07:31.385
You might not be able to tell.
I got Botox.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.187
But I am [bleep] shocked.

07:35.489 --> 07:37.658
- [bleep].
- The timing.

07:37.724 --> 07:38.659
- It's my night.

07:38.725 --> 07:40.093
How dare you?

07:40.160 --> 07:41.795
I don't care if I'm with
this [bleep] guy five minutes.

07:41.862 --> 07:43.564
If he wants to propose
and I love him,

07:43.630 --> 07:45.199
who the [bleep] is
anyone to judge?

07:45.265 --> 07:46.733
- We got a situation.

07:53.774 --> 07:56.343

up in here now.

08:05.953 --> 08:07.387

08:07.454 --> 08:08.522

- [bleep].

08:08.589 --> 08:10.123
I'm scared.

08:10.190 --> 08:11.358
- What is happening?

08:11.425 --> 08:12.693
- Is he proposing?

08:12.759 --> 08:13.994
- Stop it.

08:14.061 --> 08:16.230
- I just wanted
to say thank you all

08:16.296 --> 08:18.065
for making my first time
meeting you all

08:18.131 --> 08:20.534
'cause it's a lot of youse

08:20.601 --> 08:23.904

08:23.971 --> 08:26.139
- New Vinny is, like,
really good at speaking.

08:26.206 --> 08:27.708
And he's, like,
mature about it.

08:27.774 --> 08:29.309
So the fact that,

is really good for Ange.

08:32.279 --> 08:34.114

to come off and show you guys

08:34.181 --> 08:35.749
who I was as a person.

08:35.816 --> 08:38.485
- He really seems,
like, from the heart

08:38.552 --> 08:41.855
and that he really wants to be
welcomed into our family.

08:41.922 --> 08:43.290
It's so sweet.

08:43.357 --> 08:45.425
- Vinny, I know we were all
joking with you today.

08:45.492 --> 08:46.793
But we all knew
it was your birthday.

08:46.860 --> 08:48.395
And I hope you had a great day.

08:48.462 --> 08:49.863
I hope you had
a great birthday.

08:49.930 --> 08:51.431
- New Vinny is giving me

08:51.498 --> 08:53.133
a toast out of nowhere
right now.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.836
- I appreciate you having me
here to help you celebrate it.

08:55.903 --> 08:57.137
- That's nice.

08:57.204 --> 08:58.539
- It's actually
a nice gesture.

08:58.605 --> 08:59.806
- It's been fun.
It's been crazy.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.108
You know, a lot of laughs,

09:01.175 --> 09:02.476
bickering back and forth,
breaking chops.

09:02.543 --> 09:03.610
You know, once I get
comfortable more with you,

09:03.677 --> 09:04.811
I'm sure I'll be
throwing blows back.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.647
So I hope youse don't mind.

09:06.713 --> 09:11.018
And, um...

09:11.084 --> 09:12.686

09:12.753 --> 09:14.087
I love her.

09:14.154 --> 09:16.223

been my best friend and more.

09:21.128 --> 09:22.663
- What the [bleep] is this
all about?

09:22.729 --> 09:24.665
- Meeting all of youse at once,
it made things

09:24.731 --> 09:26.466
a lot easier to get
you all together.

09:26.533 --> 09:28.202
Ange, I just wanted you to come
up here, too, if you could.

09:28.268 --> 09:29.336

09:29.403 --> 09:30.971
- All right.

09:31.038 --> 09:31.972
- What?

09:32.039 --> 09:34.208
- Go stand next to yo' man.

09:34.274 --> 09:36.977
- I guess this toast
is not for me.

09:37.044 --> 09:38.879
- Um,

09:38.946 --> 09:41.048
Ange, can I have your hand?

09:42.382 --> 09:43.684
- Holy [bleep].

24:59.433 --> 25:01.602
- It just doesn't feel resolved

25:01.668 --> 25:03.170
with the Angelina
Twitter beef.

25:03.237 --> 25:06.840
You texted me to tweet crazy.
- Who gives a [bleep]?

25:06.907 --> 25:08.141
You're not involved
in that [bleep] fight.

25:08.208 --> 25:09.543
Get out of it.

25:09.610 --> 25:11.178
- I'm pulling Angelina
outside right now

25:11.245 --> 25:12.813
because I want
to congratulate her

25:12.880 --> 25:14.181
on her engagement.

25:14.248 --> 25:16.350
And I really want to bury
the hatchet between us,

25:16.416 --> 25:19.486
finally, and end this trip
on a positive note.

25:19.553 --> 25:21.421
Yo, talk about some--

25:21.488 --> 25:22.823
a crazy couple of days.
- Yeah.

25:22.890 --> 25:24.057
- All right?
- Yeah.

25:24.124 --> 25:25.225
- The trip is about
to end right now--

25:25.292 --> 25:27.027
and--and--actually tomorrow.

25:27.094 --> 25:29.463
And, like, I just want
to say that I'm sorry

25:29.530 --> 25:30.864
for the past couple of months.

25:30.931 --> 25:33.534
And I hope it's a beef
we could just squash.

25:33.600 --> 25:36.036
- I might not agree
with what he does to me.

25:36.103 --> 25:38.539
But I want to move on
from this.

25:38.605 --> 25:40.340
I was very mad at you,
I have to say.

25:40.407 --> 25:41.408
- Yes, yes.

25:41.475 --> 25:43.443
- More upset with you.
- About?

25:43.510 --> 25:45.712
- About everything.
But me and you,

25:45.779 --> 25:47.514
yes, have I said
some [bleep]-up things to you?

25:47.581 --> 25:48.682
Yes.
- Same.

25:48.749 --> 25:50.017
Did you throw water?
- Like, what?

25:50.083 --> 25:51.518
- Yes or no? Can you even
answer that question?

25:51.585 --> 25:52.553
- Did you [bleep] not
pay your taxes?

25:52.619 --> 25:54.288
Yes or no?
- Whoa.

25:54.354 --> 25:55.622
- And I'm sorry about that.

25:55.689 --> 25:57.057
- That's really--that's
really sweet of you.

25:57.124 --> 25:58.625
- I was trying to hit below
the belt for you--on you.

25:58.692 --> 26:00.027
- That's really sweet.
Thank you.

26:00.093 --> 26:01.428
It really means a lot to me
that you're--that--

26:01.495 --> 26:02.796
- We kind of--we kind
of went at each other.

26:02.863 --> 26:04.064
- And no, it really means
a lot to me that, like,

26:04.131 --> 26:05.365
I see a ton of accountability
right now.

26:05.432 --> 26:07.701
- Thank you.
- I was in shock.

26:07.768 --> 26:09.670
I was in shock that--that--

26:09.736 --> 26:11.205
that I got an apology.

26:11.271 --> 26:12.472
I got accountability.

26:12.539 --> 26:14.441
And she's being very mature.

26:14.508 --> 26:17.411
Maybe new Vinny is exactly
what Angelina needs.

26:17.477 --> 26:18.946
I'm so happy for you.

26:19.012 --> 26:20.314
I see the happiness in you.

26:20.380 --> 26:21.582
- Thank you.
- I see the happiness in him.

26:21.648 --> 26:22.683
- Thank you.
- I'll be honest,

26:22.749 --> 26:24.384
I really like him.

26:24.451 --> 26:25.686
- I know. He's genuine.
- I really like him.

26:25.752 --> 26:26.887
- He's a genuine guy.
- He was really good

26:26.954 --> 26:28.288
with his words.
- He's a good guy.

26:28.355 --> 26:30.624
- I see the way
that you are with him.

26:30.691 --> 26:32.125
It's sweet.

26:32.192 --> 26:35.229
- Thank you for saying that
because, I have to say,

26:35.295 --> 26:37.898
I saw a couple of people were,
like, a little weirded out.

26:37.965 --> 26:39.533
- Where?
- When I got,

26:39.600 --> 26:40.734
like, proposed to.

26:40.801 --> 26:41.969
- Oh, yeah?
Like who?

26:42.035 --> 26:43.637
- Jenni and Zack.

26:43.704 --> 26:44.638
- Oh, snap.

26:44.705 --> 26:45.739
- What the [bleep]?

26:45.806 --> 26:47.174
Are you kidding me?

26:47.241 --> 26:48.609
I don't care if I'm with
this [bleep] guy five minutes.

26:48.675 --> 26:50.944
If he wants to propose
and I love him,

26:51.011 --> 26:52.713
who the [bleep] is
anyone to judge?

26:52.779 --> 26:54.448
- What just happened?

26:54.515 --> 26:55.883
I just made up with Angelina.

26:55.949 --> 26:57.451
We've been fighting
for, like, a year.

26:57.518 --> 27:00.787
And she goes straight
into wanting smoke...

27:00.854 --> 27:02.656
with JWOWW.

27:02.723 --> 27:04.892
She's one of the toughest
ones in our group.

27:04.958 --> 27:08.629
- Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

27:08.695 --> 27:11.431
- Take your [bleep] [bleep]
out of my [bleep] face

27:11.498 --> 27:12.766
or something's gonna
[bleep] happen.

27:12.833 --> 27:14.535
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

27:14.601 --> 27:16.303
Whoa! Oh, my God!

27:16.370 --> 27:18.238
- I am [bleep] not done!

27:18.305 --> 27:20.107
- You don't want no smoke
with JWOWW.

27:20.174 --> 27:22.209
Yo, she's gonna be
pissed as [bleep].

27:23.911 --> 27:25.746
We got a situation.

27:33.520 --> 27:35.322
- ♪♪ Let the people rock ♪♪

27:35.389 --> 27:38.425

27:49.803 --> 27:51.538
The energy is crazy.

27:51.605 --> 27:52.606
This place is jumping.

27:52.673 --> 27:54.074
People are screaming.

27:54.141 --> 27:55.742
You've never seen
so many people just, like,

27:55.809 --> 27:57.778
diehard just to, like,
watch somebody DJ.

27:59.980 --> 28:01.148
- That's the thing.
- We got engaged.

28:01.215 --> 28:02.349
Are you [bleep] kidding me?

28:02.416 --> 28:03.350
- No, that's what I'm saying.

28:03.417 --> 28:04.585
- Are you [bleep] kidding me?

28:08.488 --> 28:11.525

28:26.673 --> 28:29.877
- When I say happy,
you say birthday.

28:29.943 --> 28:31.445
Happy.
all: Birthday!

28:31.512 --> 28:33.247
- Happy.
all: Birthday!

28:33.313 --> 28:34.381
- Oh, [bleep].

28:34.448 --> 28:35.616
- Yes.
- No one should be haters.

28:35.682 --> 28:37.518
- Okay.
- They should be happy for us.

28:40.120 --> 28:43.490
[airhorn blaring]

28:43.557 --> 28:45.826
- Pauly went from not saying
my birthday all day

28:45.893 --> 28:49.162
to, like, shouting me out
in front of all these people.

28:49.229 --> 28:51.131
Like, I got a cake.
I got sparklers.

28:51.198 --> 28:52.499
Like, all my roommates
are finally

28:52.566 --> 28:53.834
acknowledging my birthday.

28:53.901 --> 28:56.470
- I'll be honest,
I didn't see JWOWW

28:56.537 --> 28:57.738
when you got proposed to.

28:57.804 --> 29:00.207
- When I count to three,
I want you to scream

29:00.274 --> 29:02.910
as loud as you can
for the Keto Guido.

29:02.976 --> 29:04.478
[cheering]

29:04.545 --> 29:07.814
1, 2, 3.

29:07.881 --> 29:08.815
[cheering]

29:08.882 --> 29:10.217
- I watched everybody's faces.

29:10.284 --> 29:12.119
Deena and Chris, not haters.

29:12.186 --> 29:14.021
Nicole and I, we locked eyes.

29:14.087 --> 29:15.355
She was very happy for me.
- Wow.

29:15.422 --> 29:17.224
- But Jenni and Zack
at that corner, man,

29:17.291 --> 29:20.627
it wasn't, like,
happiness for me.

29:20.694 --> 29:23.730
[cheering]

29:33.941 --> 29:35.475
- I didn't know
that you saw this.

29:35.542 --> 29:36.476
- Look at his face.

29:36.543 --> 29:38.178
He [bleep] saw it too.

29:40.781 --> 29:42.015
I see everything, Mike.

29:42.082 --> 29:44.051
I'm very good with,
like, reading people.

29:44.117 --> 29:45.152
I'm so good at reading people.

29:45.219 --> 29:46.687
- Okay.
- And then--and then,

29:46.753 --> 29:49.323
she was like, well, how long
have you been with her for?

29:49.389 --> 29:51.124
- Uh-huh.
- And then Zack picked it up

29:51.191 --> 29:54.061
with, like, asking something,
like, similar or something.

29:54.127 --> 29:55.863
- Oh, [bleep].
You're bringing Zack into it?

29:55.929 --> 29:57.931
- He was involved!
- Oh, yo.

29:57.998 --> 29:59.967
Yo, she's getting wild
right now.

30:00.033 --> 30:01.235
- He actually said
to me--he's like,

30:01.301 --> 30:02.336
when did you get divorced?

30:02.402 --> 30:03.670
I said in May.

30:03.737 --> 30:05.072
It doesn't matter.

30:05.138 --> 30:08.208
It doesn't matter if I got
divorced May [bleep] 29th

30:08.275 --> 30:10.244
and I got proposed to May 30th.

30:10.310 --> 30:13.046
If that's what my man wants
to do, and I want to do,

30:13.113 --> 30:14.815
and we love each other,
it doesn't matter.

30:14.882 --> 30:16.550
- I feel that Angelina is
getting in her own head.

30:16.617 --> 30:18.485
She just got engaged.

30:18.552 --> 30:20.120
Be happy for yourself.

30:20.187 --> 30:21.321
Be on a vibe.

30:21.388 --> 30:24.024
But she went straight to drama.

30:35.235 --> 30:36.236
- I don't know.
I don't know.

30:36.303 --> 30:37.304
I don't know.
I mean, and--

30:37.371 --> 30:38.505
- I saw what I saw.
Please.

30:38.572 --> 30:40.007
- Yo, but Jenni--
- Please don't defend her

30:40.073 --> 30:41.375
because you're gonna look
like an asshole.

30:41.441 --> 30:43.110
- I'm not--I'm not
defending anybody.

30:43.177 --> 30:45.612
I'm just trying to say
that, like, Jenni,

30:45.679 --> 30:47.548
she's gonna be pissed
as [bleep].

30:52.786 --> 30:55.055
- Well, I'm assuming
they both went outside

30:55.122 --> 30:57.624
to talk about
their little Twitter war

30:57.691 --> 30:59.393
that they started.

30:59.459 --> 31:01.361
And hopefully,
they're getting along out there

31:01.428 --> 31:03.964
because the last thing I want
is them two to fight.

31:04.031 --> 31:05.499
- Why is she gonna be pissed?
That I'm upset--

31:05.566 --> 31:07.768
that I--
that I saw her face turn?

31:07.835 --> 31:09.203
It was like...
- All right, all right.

31:09.269 --> 31:10.504
All right, all right.
- Really?

31:10.571 --> 31:11.638
You just got engaged?

31:11.705 --> 31:12.673
Like, how long
you been with him?

31:12.739 --> 31:14.341
Like, that's not nice.

31:14.408 --> 31:16.176
I don't care if I'm with
this [bleep] guy five minutes.

31:16.243 --> 31:17.411
- No, that's what
I'm trying to say.

31:17.477 --> 31:19.046
- If he wants to propose
and I love him--

31:19.112 --> 31:20.714
- I'm trying to say
is that you--

31:20.781 --> 31:22.182
- That's what's gonna [bleep]--
if he want to do what he did...

31:22.249 --> 31:23.183
- You just--
- He has every right.

31:23.250 --> 31:24.618
- You just got engaged, okay?

31:24.685 --> 31:26.720
- Are you serious?
- And I want--I think--

31:26.787 --> 31:28.088
- Who is anybody
to [bleep] judge?

31:28.155 --> 31:29.523
- I think--it's my opinion--

31:29.590 --> 31:31.458
- If I want to have
a child with a guy

31:31.525 --> 31:34.328
I just met yesterday,
that's my [bleep] business.

31:34.394 --> 31:36.463
- Angelina is fired up
right now.

31:36.530 --> 31:40.367
I'm trying to leave NOLA
on positive vibes, but--

31:40.434 --> 31:42.402
- Who the [bleep] is
anyone to judge?

31:42.469 --> 31:43.770
God can judge me.

31:45.839 --> 31:48.408
I watched everything transpire
around the table.

31:48.475 --> 31:50.444
I watched it, Mike.
Are you kidding me?

31:50.511 --> 31:52.212
- Oh, my God,
are they fighting?

31:52.279 --> 31:54.581
- Who?
- Angelina and Mike.

31:55.716 --> 31:57.251
I hope not.
- Why?

31:57.317 --> 32:00.053
- I hope it's, like, all good
because whenever Angelina has

32:00.120 --> 32:02.489
a great moment in her life,
it seems like she likes to,

32:02.556 --> 32:04.825
like, sabotage it a little bit.

32:04.892 --> 32:06.793
So I hope she's just,
like, talking about maybe,

32:06.860 --> 32:09.897
like, wedding stuff
with Mike or something.

32:09.963 --> 32:11.899
- How do you think we should
handle this going forward?

32:11.965 --> 32:14.201
- I don't [bleep] know.
- You know?

32:14.268 --> 32:15.969
- I saw their [bleep] faces
across the table.

32:16.036 --> 32:17.538
I was not--
I was not happy with it.

32:17.604 --> 32:18.872
- I don't think you want
to say anything right now,

32:18.939 --> 32:20.073
because you just got engaged.

32:20.140 --> 32:22.709
You know,
if Jenni senses confrontation,

32:22.776 --> 32:25.312
you know, she's--she's--
she's free smoke.

32:25.379 --> 32:26.914
- Get the [bleep] out of here.

32:26.980 --> 32:27.915
- Oh!
- Oh.

32:27.981 --> 32:28.982
- You see what I'm saying?

32:29.049 --> 32:30.484
- You do not want
that backhand.

32:30.551 --> 32:31.785
She wants the smoke.
- I don't give a [bleep].

32:31.852 --> 32:33.453
Do you see my man?
I don't give a [bleep].

32:33.520 --> 32:35.455
- Really? On the last day?

32:35.522 --> 32:37.057

- They're assholes.

40:39.806 --> 40:41.508
Like, I just feel
like that's [bleep].

40:41.575 --> 40:42.809
- I want no part of this.

40:42.876 --> 40:44.344
- I will not let that--

40:44.411 --> 40:45.479
it won't happen.

40:45.546 --> 40:47.047
I won't do it.

40:52.386 --> 40:53.253
- I saw the shade.

40:53.320 --> 40:54.555
- That's not what happened.

40:54.621 --> 40:55.923
- Seems like you want
the smoke right now.

40:55.989 --> 40:57.558
- Just when you thought
the beef was over,

40:57.624 --> 40:58.725
they pulled you back in.

40:58.792 --> 40:59.960
- Don't--don't speak
at this point.

41:00.027 --> 41:01.995
- Everybody is [bleep] happy.

41:02.062 --> 41:03.230
- Two of us are going
in the elevator.

41:03.297 --> 41:04.464
Only one of us [bleep]
is coming out.

41:04.531 --> 41:06.033
- Why does she do this?

41:06.099 --> 41:08.669
- I was never negative
for one second.

41:08.735 --> 41:10.070
- I'm gonna tell you this
right now.

41:10.137 --> 41:11.371
You don't want
to [bleep] with me.
