{\an7}What you doing about
coming and staying with me?

00:08.208 --> 00:10.377
{\an7}Like, I want you to move in.
I want us to be together.

00:10.443 --> 00:12.579
{\an7}I'm trying to show you that
I'm in this for the long run.

00:12.645 --> 00:14.080
{\an8}Let's get
matching tattoos.

00:14.147 --> 00:16.750
{\an8}I already got it.

00:16.816 --> 00:20.053
{\an8}I just want this man
to act right.

00:20.120 --> 00:21.521
{\an8}Is that too much?

00:21.588 --> 00:22.655
{\an8}I don't want to hear what
(bleep) else he has to say

00:22.722 --> 00:24.491
{\an8}unless I see us
moving forward.

00:24.557 --> 00:26.359
{\an8}(Apryl) One of my oldest
friends Shanda

and she's new in town.

00:28.061 --> 00:29.929
{\an8}You single? You
married, huh?

00:28.061 --> 00:29.929
{\an5}No, I'm not

00:28.061 --> 00:29.929
{\an5}single.

00:29.996 --> 00:32.198
{\an8}Yeah, I'm very married. Yeah.

00:29.996 --> 00:32.198
{\an8}I see that ring
on your finger, man.

00:32.265 --> 00:34.300
{\an8}You've got to meet my family.

00:34.367 --> 00:37.003
{\an7}I'm not opposed to any of that.
All that should come in time.

00:37.070 --> 00:38.571
{\an7}My heart and my mind
are you with,

00:38.638 --> 00:40.740

move in together.

hanging out with Teairra.

00:44.511 --> 00:46.880
{\an8}She invited me to a party.

00:46.946 --> 00:48.548

00:50.683 --> 00:52.852

{\an5}(Moniece)
So Rich is back in New York
after a great week here with me.

01:47.140 --> 01:50.243
{\an5}And it gives me
a minute to try and repair
the relationship with my mom.

01:50.310 --> 01:51.978
And that's
a work in progress.

01:52.045 --> 01:54.180
{\an1}90 degrees, 90.
Don't go over your front.

01:54.247 --> 01:55.849
{\an4}Let's go.

01:54.247 --> 01:55.849
Can I lounge your face into...

01:55.915 --> 01:57.750
{\an1}Okay, Moniece, you don't
want that war with me.

01:57.817 --> 01:59.652
{\an5}(Moniece)
A lot has gone on
between my mom and I.

01:59.719 --> 02:01.087
Like, a lot of bad stuff.

02:01.154 --> 02:04.290
And I'm still trying to
work through all of that.

02:04.357 --> 02:05.592
So can we just get real?

02:05.658 --> 02:07.927
There's a part of
truth and honesty

02:07.994 --> 02:10.163
that we need to get to in order
to move forward.

02:10.229 --> 02:12.465
{\an1}So can we at least talk about
a couple of those things?

02:12.532 --> 02:15.001
{\an5}No need to relive the past
in my personal opinion
because it happened.

02:15.068 --> 02:16.469
{\an1}You have hurt me
and I have hurt you,

02:16.536 --> 02:18.805
but what I'm talking about is
moving on to a healthy place.

02:18.872 --> 02:22.408
{\an1}So you can tell me what your
issue is with the relationship

02:22.475 --> 02:25.044
{\an1}because we've been up and down
for a long time.

02:25.111 --> 02:27.113
Judgment.
You're judgmental.

02:27.180 --> 02:30.316
{\an5}You're critical.

02:27.180 --> 02:30.316
{\an1}I've been hard on you,
obviously.

02:30.383 --> 02:32.252
{\an6}Admission.

02:30.383 --> 02:32.252
{\an1}Okay.

02:32.318 --> 02:35.822
{\an1}And you've been very difficult
for me as a mom.

02:35.889 --> 02:37.257
{\an8}I feel like
I've made mistakes.

02:37.323 --> 02:38.625
{\an8}You feel like
you've made mistakes.

02:38.691 --> 02:41.794
{\an7}All I'm saying is let's stop
pointing the finger.

02:41.861 --> 02:43.296
Moniece wants to walk away

02:43.363 --> 02:45.999
and leave what's is
in the past in the past.

02:46.065 --> 02:47.934
But I truly believe,
as a parent,

02:48.001 --> 02:50.203
{\an8}that Moniece's priorities
are out of line.

02:50.270 --> 02:51.738
{\an8}The first thing
that Moniece has to do

02:51.804 --> 02:53.406
{\an8}if she's ever gonna
accomplish anything,

02:53.473 --> 02:56.142
she has to focus on herself

02:56.209 --> 02:59.412
and stop being distracted
by men, by sex toys,

02:59.479 --> 03:00.980
and by selfishness.

03:01.047 --> 03:03.449
Moniece has got to
hone it in,

03:03.516 --> 03:05.818
bring it in,
and make Kameron her priority.

03:05.885 --> 03:07.954
{\an1}You're coming to me
and you're saying, "Mom,

03:08.021 --> 03:09.756
{\an1}these are the things
I would like to accomplish."

03:09.822 --> 03:10.957
Let's talk about what they are.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.692
"A"-- you want to
actually do what?

03:12.759 --> 03:14.160
{\an5}Get your singing career--

03:12.759 --> 03:14.160
I want to get in shape.

03:14.227 --> 03:15.762
Okay, what's the next thing?

03:15.828 --> 03:18.498
Work on my... music.

03:18.565 --> 03:20.667
Okay, what's the next thing?

03:22.402 --> 03:25.605
{\an5}Kameron.

03:22.402 --> 03:25.605
Well, obviously Kameron
is a priority.

03:25.672 --> 03:27.974
{\an4}Okay.

03:25.672 --> 03:27.974
I shouldn't have to say that.

03:28.041 --> 03:30.977
{\an4}But we do.
There's a discipline that's
missing here with everything.

03:31.044 --> 03:32.712
{\an1}When you were born,
Moniece,

03:32.779 --> 03:34.614
I was young as hell.

03:34.681 --> 03:36.549
{\an1}I wasn't a typical
19-year-old kid.

03:36.616 --> 03:38.051
You were my life.

03:38.117 --> 03:40.820
{\an4}Raising you was
my number one thing.
That's a discipline.

03:40.887 --> 03:42.589
I'm trying to help you
do some of the things

03:42.655 --> 03:44.090
that if you put them in order,

03:44.157 --> 03:46.893
{\an1}you can get back on to be
the leader of Team Kam,

03:46.960 --> 03:48.494
{\an1}not just a member
of the group.

03:48.561 --> 03:50.330
{\an1}So let's talk about
what's got you off-track.

03:50.396 --> 03:52.799
{\an1}Are you actually dating
Richie Dollarz?

03:52.865 --> 03:55.435
That's my situation.

03:55.501 --> 03:58.271
So if I need advice
about that,

03:58.338 --> 04:00.139
then I'll come to you
for advice.

04:00.206 --> 04:01.908
{\an1}If we're gonna build
a new relationship of trust,

04:01.975 --> 04:04.644
can I meet him?
Richie Dollarz.

04:04.711 --> 04:06.579
{\an5}Will you allow that?

04:04.711 --> 04:06.579
{\an3}Sure.

04:06.646 --> 04:08.348
{\an5}(Marla)
So I'm looking forward
to meeting Rich Dollarz.

04:08.414 --> 04:10.350
But you better believe
before I actually sit down,

04:10.416 --> 04:11.718
I'm gonna do my homework.

04:11.784 --> 04:14.087
Rich-- first of all,
his name is Rich Dollarz.

04:14.153 --> 04:16.022
I know his mama
didn't name him that.

04:16.089 --> 04:19.024
You better believe that before
he even gets a chance to say,

04:19.091 --> 04:20.892
"Hey, how you doing?"
to Kameron,

04:20.959 --> 04:23.296
I'm gonna know what it is
that we're dealing with.

04:23.363 --> 04:26.899
{\an1}So what if I meet him and
I'm just, okay, uh, uh, hell no?

04:26.966 --> 04:28.768
Then I'll take
into consideration

04:28.835 --> 04:31.170
{\an5}and I will proceed
with caution.

04:28.835 --> 04:31.170
That's fair.

04:31.237 --> 04:32.839
{\an1}That doesn't mean
I'm gonna break up with him

04:32.905 --> 04:35.141
{\an5}or leave him in the dust.

04:32.905 --> 04:35.141
Well, that'll happen anyway.

04:35.208 --> 04:37.176
{\an1}I don't think you can tolerate
anybody for a long time.

04:37.243 --> 04:39.679
I think you love change.
It's part of who you are.

07:18.504 --> 07:20.339
{\an1}So are we just gonna
do this all year--

07:20.406 --> 07:22.375
just all year-round?

07:22.441 --> 07:24.944
{\an4}You know, you're going
through some things, but
from the looks of things,

07:25.011 --> 07:26.813
{\an1}baby, you're not
going through too much.

07:26.879 --> 07:28.915
{\an1}You're-- you're
little social media

07:28.981 --> 07:31.083
looks like you're having
a good damn time to me.

07:31.150 --> 07:33.286
You and Milan, you guys
are running around here,

07:33.352 --> 07:35.822
you know, with, like, chickens
with your (bleep) heads cut off

07:35.888 --> 07:37.523
with all these (bleep) hos.

07:37.590 --> 07:39.458
{\an1}I used to be
your little armpiece.

07:39.525 --> 07:41.260
You used to love
showing me off.

07:41.327 --> 07:43.596
You tell everybody
how this is my wife

07:43.663 --> 07:45.464
{\an4}and everyone would tell you
how beautiful that I am.

07:43.663 --> 07:45.464
Okay, we've fallen off.

07:45.531 --> 07:47.333
{\an5}You know we've fallen off.

07:45.531 --> 07:47.333
Now who are you showing off?

07:47.400 --> 07:48.601
I'm just saying,
you know we've fallen off.

07:48.668 --> 07:50.770
Is she outside?

07:50.837 --> 07:52.605
{\an1}Tell me.
I'm not gonna go out there.

07:52.672 --> 07:54.974
{\an5}Is she outside?

07:52.672 --> 07:54.974
I don't know
what to say besides...

07:55.041 --> 07:56.509
{\an1}I ain't gonna cry.
I'm a big girl.

07:56.576 --> 07:58.244
Is this a conversation
about me and you

07:58.311 --> 08:00.112
or is it a conversation
about everybody else?

08:00.179 --> 08:03.716
{\an1}I don't need to sit here
and be shelled by some man.

08:03.783 --> 08:06.552
{\an5}(Miles)
I absolutely hate sitting here
hurting my best friend.

08:06.619 --> 08:08.487
She still wants this
romantic relationship.

08:08.554 --> 08:10.923
And right now,
that's just not up for grabs.

08:10.990 --> 08:13.059
I could tell Amber that
I met somebody else,

08:13.125 --> 08:15.695
{\an5}make up some (bleep)
and tell her that I fell in love
with another woman

08:15.761 --> 08:17.763
so she can go ahead
and move on with her life.

08:17.830 --> 08:19.899
But honestly,
we've come too far.

08:19.966 --> 08:23.035
And Amber's too important to me
to only give her half the truth.

08:23.102 --> 08:25.638
At the end of the day, maybe
I am the root of the problem.

08:25.705 --> 08:27.406
And I'm just saying,
like, right now,

08:27.473 --> 08:29.742
I don't know

08:29.809 --> 08:33.179
what more I can
ask of you

08:33.246 --> 08:36.749
besides to just let me
figure things out

08:36.816 --> 08:38.751
and just be patient
with me.

08:38.818 --> 08:40.986
And I'm not trying to lead you
on, I'm not trying to hurt you.

08:41.053 --> 08:43.389
You know how much love
I have for you.

08:43.456 --> 08:46.759
{\an1}When you're ready for me
and all of this

08:46.826 --> 08:50.630
{\an1}and us and a relationship
and to move forward

08:50.696 --> 08:52.198
{\an5}and to be a man.

08:50.696 --> 08:52.198
Why do we have to rush?

08:52.265 --> 08:53.432
{\an4}No, no.

08:52.265 --> 08:53.432
Why do we have to rush?

08:53.499 --> 08:55.601
{\an1}When you're ready
to be a man--

08:55.668 --> 08:57.536
{\an5}I'm being a man by telling you
I don't want to string you on.

08:55.668 --> 08:57.536
When you're ready to be a man

08:57.603 --> 08:59.505
{\an5}and tell me what's going on...

08:57.603 --> 08:59.505
I am being a man by
asking you for time.

08:59.572 --> 09:01.440
{\an1}...and you're ready for this
and you're ready for us,

09:01.507 --> 09:03.976
{\an4}then guess what,
you call me, okay?

09:01.507 --> 09:03.976
You gonna run?

09:04.043 --> 09:05.711
{\an5}You gonna run? Wow.

09:04.043 --> 09:05.711
{\an1}Uh-huh.

09:05.778 --> 09:06.846
All right.

09:10.449 --> 09:12.685
{\an8}Are you happy?

09:10.449 --> 09:12.685
{\an8}Well, I'm really happy.

09:12.752 --> 09:15.221
{\an7}And I'm even happier that we're
going to dinner with my mom.

09:15.288 --> 09:17.356
{\an8}Surprise.

09:17.423 --> 09:19.158
{\an8}And I don't want to do
that why?

09:19.225 --> 09:21.661
{\an7}You know, me moving here,
Amber live down the street.

09:21.727 --> 09:24.730
{\an7}And you're still struggling
telling her you're in
another relationship?

09:24.797 --> 09:26.299
{\an8}I'm a tell her when
I'm ready to tell her.

09:26.365 --> 09:28.968
{\an7}It needs to be soon or I'm gonna
call her and tell her myself.

09:29.035 --> 09:31.270
{\an7}And if you call her
and tell her then you lose me.

09:29.035 --> 09:31.270
{\an5}Then, oh well.

09:31.337 --> 09:32.672
{\an7}You should be thanking me.
You're welcome.

09:32.738 --> 09:34.941
{\an8}I will never thank a ho
for anything.

09:48.054 --> 09:51.057
Hi, my name is Shanda Denyce
and I'm a singer from Chicago.

09:51.123 --> 09:53.626
I'm married to Willie Taylor
from Day26.

09:53.693 --> 09:55.494
We just moved to L.A.
a few months ago

09:55.561 --> 09:57.196
and it's been
a crazy transition.

09:57.263 --> 09:58.965
Between taking care
of our two kids

09:59.031 --> 10:00.199
and trying to
get adjusted here,

10:00.266 --> 10:01.867
we haven't even
had time to unpack.

10:03.703 --> 10:05.471
Yo, does this work?

10:05.538 --> 10:08.007
{\an4}I mean, I just unpacked it
out of the box.

10:05.538 --> 10:08.007
Oh, yeah.

10:08.074 --> 10:09.742
{\an3}No...

10:09.809 --> 10:12.845
Willie and I have been together
for about 13 years.

10:12.912 --> 10:15.014
{\an8}So when he decided to do
the solo career thing,

10:15.081 --> 10:17.950
{\an8}I was 110% down to move to L.A.

10:18.017 --> 10:19.552
{\an8}so he can make
his dream happen.

10:19.618 --> 10:22.621
We decided to take a huge risk
and live off of our savings,

10:22.688 --> 10:24.623
and we got enough
for about six months.

10:24.690 --> 10:27.827
But a lot has to fall into place
for it all to work out.

10:27.893 --> 10:29.228
So what you got planned
for today?

10:29.295 --> 10:30.663
I'm fittin' to hit the gym,
then I got another session.

10:30.730 --> 10:32.965
{\an5}How's it going so far?

10:30.730 --> 10:32.965
Everything is great,

10:33.032 --> 10:35.835
{\an1}but there's so much stuff
I want to get done...

10:35.901 --> 10:37.636
{\an8}Yo, what's up?
My name is Willie Taylor.

10:37.703 --> 10:39.772
{\an8}And you may know me
from the group Day26.

10:39.839 --> 10:42.908
We toured the U.S. and the world
and had a really good run.

10:42.975 --> 10:45.177
But now it's time for me to take
this journey as a solo artist.

10:45.244 --> 10:46.912
And that's a whole
other ballgame.

10:46.979 --> 10:49.982
When I decided to leave Day26,
my family, my wife, my kids,

10:50.049 --> 10:51.684
they were
very supportive of me

10:51.751 --> 10:53.386
because they know
that this is my dream.

10:53.452 --> 10:55.521
So I moved to L.A.
to get closer to my label

10:55.588 --> 10:57.490
and to try and get
my album off the ground.

10:57.556 --> 10:59.191
But the truth of
the matter is this--

10:59.258 --> 11:01.293
if my solo career
doesn't succeed,

11:01.360 --> 11:03.062
there's gonna be
a lot of people suffering.

11:03.129 --> 11:04.397
And I'm not gonna
let that happen.

11:04.463 --> 11:05.631
So what do you think
about the finances?

11:05.698 --> 11:06.966
Do you think,
like, you know,

11:07.033 --> 11:09.735
eventually I'm gonna
have to get a job or...

11:09.802 --> 11:11.237
'Cause, you know,
I don't mind working.

11:11.303 --> 11:13.205
But I'm not gonna be
sitting here, you know,

11:13.272 --> 11:16.208
{\an1}"Hey, we got like this much
left. We can only buy--"

11:16.275 --> 11:17.676
I'm not that.
I'm not gonna do it.

11:17.743 --> 11:19.378
I know we don't have
the funds like that

11:19.445 --> 11:22.681

no dumb (bleep), but...

11:22.748 --> 11:24.216

the (bleep) out.

11:26.952 --> 11:28.888
{\an1}I mean, I get it.
No, no, no. You gotta listen.

11:28.954 --> 11:30.823
{\an5}Aye, aye, aye.

11:28.954 --> 11:30.823
No, listen.

11:30.890 --> 11:33.192

11:30.890 --> 11:33.192
Chill, chill, chill.

11:33.259 --> 11:35.761

more expensive than Chicago,

11:35.828 --> 11:37.363
but, damn, that much?!

11:37.430 --> 11:39.198
Money is already
starting to go fast.

11:39.265 --> 11:41.667
That clock is ticking
faster and faster every day.

11:41.734 --> 11:45.037

and Willie's career is not
where it needs to be,

11:45.104 --> 11:47.239
we're gonna have to pack up
and move back to Chicago.

11:47.306 --> 11:49.575

to give up on his dreams.

12:38.257 --> 12:39.959
She's been bugging me
to get a place together.

12:40.025 --> 12:41.393
And if we're gonna be serious,

12:41.460 --> 12:43.462
these are the types of steps

{\an8}So big,
it tickles my fancy.

12:58.444 --> 13:01.213

they're stuck together.

{\an1}the oh, so tumultuous

I volunteered you.

{\an5}(Rich)
I'm not so sure about
meeting Moniece's mom.

13:44.423 --> 13:46.926
Mo's hinted to me that things
are complicated with Mom Dukes.

13:46.992 --> 13:48.861
Dinner with Moniece's mom
is not my idea

13:48.928 --> 13:50.296
of a perfect evening out,

13:50.362 --> 13:52.531
but then again, Mo's got me
doing a bunch of stuff

13:52.598 --> 13:53.766
that I never thought I'd do.

13:53.832 --> 13:55.434
I need to know
what's going on

13:55.501 --> 13:57.436
between you and your mom
before you set me up.

13:57.503 --> 14:00.339
Just so many things
have transpired...

14:00.406 --> 14:02.141
{\an5}I.E. like, come on.

14:00.406 --> 14:02.141
{\an1}...before.

14:02.208 --> 14:05.077
{\an1}I feel like she
played a really big role

14:05.144 --> 14:07.146
{\an1}in me losing custody
of Kameron.

14:07.213 --> 14:09.081
She said she didn't
play a part in that,

14:09.148 --> 14:10.950
but she never showed up
to support me in court.

14:11.016 --> 14:13.185
So we never really
got over that hump.

14:13.252 --> 14:15.154
{\an1}And then when
we were in mediation,

14:15.221 --> 14:17.723
{\an1}baby daddy felt like
one of the main reasons

14:17.790 --> 14:20.092
{\an1}we didn't work out
was because of my mom.

14:20.159 --> 14:21.594
Why am I doing
this dinner?

14:21.660 --> 14:23.495
{\an1}'Cause it sounds to me like
maybe you and your mother

14:23.562 --> 14:24.863
should have a couple of
more dinners.

14:24.930 --> 14:27.199
{\an1}I'm trying to extend
the olive branch

14:27.266 --> 14:30.536
{\an1}by allowing her to meet with you
because that's what she asked.

14:30.603 --> 14:32.438
Well, listen, we meet
your moms, we hang out,

14:32.504 --> 14:35.074
{\an1}we have a couple of drinks,
we chitchat...

14:36.675 --> 14:38.644
it is what it is.

14:39.945 --> 14:42.014
♪♪

14:45.284 --> 14:46.785
{\an5}(Nas)
Nia can think
whatever she wants.

14:46.852 --> 14:49.788
But the real is that
Dre's still (bleep) with me.

14:49.855 --> 14:51.724
{\an8}And even after we got into
it the other day,

14:51.790 --> 14:52.891
{\an8}he still hit me up for drinks.

14:52.958 --> 14:54.193
It's like I don't know
what to do.

14:54.260 --> 14:56.362
Do I continue to talk to him?

14:56.428 --> 14:58.497
Do I not?
Because I do care about him.

15:04.870 --> 15:07.072
{\an5}What's going on?

15:04.870 --> 15:07.072
You tell me.

15:07.139 --> 15:09.475
I should've known
(bleep) Dre calls me to meet

15:09.541 --> 15:11.844
and he comes in
walking with Nia on his arm?

15:11.910 --> 15:13.545
What's he want me to do,
punch her in her face?

15:13.612 --> 15:14.880
I don't know what's going on,

15:14.947 --> 15:16.382
but I'm not down
with this (bleep).

15:16.448 --> 15:19.318
I called you up here
so we could just go ahead

15:19.385 --> 15:21.854
and clarify everything,
you know what I'm saying?

15:21.920 --> 15:24.556
{\an4}Oh, okay.

15:21.920 --> 15:24.556
So what's good?
What's Gucci?

15:24.623 --> 15:26.058
I don't know.
You tell me.

15:26.125 --> 15:28.460
Yesterday, we were good.

15:28.527 --> 15:31.597
This wasn't a situation, so...

15:31.664 --> 15:33.432
{\an5}It's always the situation.

15:31.664 --> 15:33.432
Uh! Anyway....

15:33.499 --> 15:35.567
{\an5}This is my girlfriend
at the end of the day.

15:33.499 --> 15:35.567
Now it's your girlfriend?

15:35.634 --> 15:37.703
{\an4}'Cause yesterday it
wasn't your girlfriend
and you was just kissing me

15:37.770 --> 15:40.339
{\an1}and asking me to come
(bleep) with you.

15:40.406 --> 15:42.207
I told you, if you wanna be
with Nia, then be with Nia.

15:42.274 --> 15:44.910
{\an1}Y'all can be together.
Like, it's all good.

15:44.977 --> 15:47.012
{\an1}But you text me telling me
that you wanted me back.

15:47.079 --> 15:48.514
You are exaggerating
a lot of (bleep).

15:48.580 --> 15:50.282
{\an1}So you didn't do that?
You didn't say that to me?

15:50.349 --> 15:53.185
{\an4}'Cause I can bring out
text messages and we can
put it all out on the table.

15:53.252 --> 15:55.254
{\an5}I'd like to see it.

15:53.252 --> 15:55.254
Since you want to play.

15:55.321 --> 15:57.289
{\an5}I want to see it.

15:55.321 --> 15:57.289
Here you go, here you go.

15:57.356 --> 16:00.526
{\an8}I can to fix Nas
and put her in her place,
you know what I'm saying?

16:00.592 --> 16:03.329
{\an8}Now, what I didn't expect, was
the two of them comparing notes.

16:03.395 --> 16:05.264
I should have thought
this (bleep) through.

16:05.331 --> 16:06.932
I'm just telling you,

16:06.999 --> 16:09.134
like, if you're saying
that you're with her,

16:09.201 --> 16:13.439
{\an4}and, like, you're trying to
deny the fact that you--

16:09.201 --> 16:13.439
I'm not trying to deny nothin'.

16:13.505 --> 16:16.075
{\an5}Everything-- everything
is out in the open.

16:13.505 --> 16:16.075
So you're not denying...

16:16.141 --> 16:19.044
{\an5}(Nia)
Looking at Nas phone gave me
a whole lot of information that

16:19.111 --> 16:20.279
{\an8}I wasn't expecting.

16:20.346 --> 16:21.680
{\an8}I can see why she's confused

16:21.747 --> 16:23.849
{\an8}'cause Dre's leading her on
when he's mad at me.

16:23.916 --> 16:26.018
And there's a lot that
he's not being honest about.

16:26.085 --> 16:28.387
{\an1}So Nia knows that you said
that you wanted to be with me

16:28.454 --> 16:29.722
{\an1}and our love
is never gonna end.

16:29.788 --> 16:31.090
And Nia knows all of that.

16:31.156 --> 16:33.225
Yes, you are exaggerating
a lot of (bleep).

16:33.292 --> 16:35.461
{\an5}Did you say you wanted me back?

16:33.292 --> 16:35.461
Yes, I said that.

16:35.527 --> 16:37.363
{\an4}Okay.

16:35.527 --> 16:37.363
Why are you sitting
over here, then?

16:38.797 --> 16:40.899
You wrong.
You know that, right?

16:40.966 --> 16:42.935
{\an5}At the end of the day,
if you want me to sit here
and make a choice,

16:43.001 --> 16:44.503
if you want me to do that,
we can do that.

16:44.570 --> 16:47.639
Or I don't have to be
neither one of y'all.

16:47.706 --> 16:50.642
At the end of the day--
at the end of the day,

16:50.709 --> 16:53.011
I got a million (bleep)
just on my (bleep).

16:53.078 --> 16:55.347
{\an1}You have so many bitches
but you still hitting my phone

16:55.414 --> 16:57.149
{\an1}and you know me
and her don't get along.

16:57.216 --> 16:59.118
{\an5}Check this out.

16:57.216 --> 16:59.118
Was you not trying to get me
to come back to your house?

16:59.184 --> 17:01.353
{\an5}Yes, I said that.
Yes, I said that.

16:59.184 --> 17:01.353
And I was like no.

17:01.420 --> 17:02.721
{\an5}Yes, I said that.

17:01.420 --> 17:02.721
Again, you're welcome.

17:02.788 --> 17:04.256
{\an5}Yes, I said that.

17:02.788 --> 17:04.256
{\an1}Like...

17:04.323 --> 17:06.157
{\an5}Who's welcome?

17:04.323 --> 17:06.157
{\an1}You should be thanking me.
You're welcome.

17:06.224 --> 17:08.193
I will never thank a ho
for anything.

17:08.260 --> 17:09.862
{\an4}A ho, bitch?
We were friends.

17:08.260 --> 17:09.862
You a lie.

17:09.928 --> 17:12.097
{\an1}You think I don't know where
that (bleep) been, bitch? Bye.

17:12.164 --> 17:14.233
You sit your fat ass right there
and shut the (bleep) up.

17:14.299 --> 17:16.367
{\an1}I'm fat?! Bitch,
shut the (bleep) up, bitch!

17:18.470 --> 17:21.339
(Bleep), bitch!

17:21.406 --> 17:23.642
(man)
Break it up. Let her go.

17:23.709 --> 17:26.044
{\an1}Bitch got me all
(bleep) up.

17:26.111 --> 17:27.713
{\an8}(Ray J)
Listen, I'm gonna
trust in God.

17:27.780 --> 17:30.716
{\an8}If Princess is 100,
it's gonna be right.

17:30.783 --> 17:33.585
{\an8}If she not, she gonna
get exposed, period.

17:33.652 --> 17:35.320
{\an8}Your daughter's happy.

17:35.387 --> 17:37.656
{\an7}Then, under them circumstances,
you should be happy as well.

17:37.723 --> 17:40.926
{\an7}I'm gonna take what
you've given me as a start.

17:40.993 --> 17:43.729
{\an7}And I'm gonna take what you've
given me and make it an end.

17:50.836 --> 17:53.105
{\an8}Let me go, fool.
Let me go, fool.

17:53.172 --> 17:54.740
{\an8}I ain't going nowhere,
let me go.

17:54.807 --> 17:56.575
{\an8}Dre has done a lot of (bleep)
in the past,

17:56.642 --> 17:59.344
{\an8}but this is the first time
I've been left speechless.

17:59.411 --> 18:01.814
{\an4}I'm just sorry that
you had to even get into
the conversation like that.

18:01.880 --> 18:04.416
{\an4}I wouldn't have even
invited her up here if I knew
it was gonna go down like that.

18:04.483 --> 18:06.485
{\an1}Feel me?
But it's over with, though.

18:06.552 --> 18:09.388
I have nothing left to say to
this man that's disrespected me,

18:09.455 --> 18:11.990
embarrassed me,
and taken me for granted.

18:12.057 --> 18:13.759
I keep seeing
his mouth moving,

18:13.826 --> 18:16.895
{\an5}but I'm not about to listen
to (bleep) he has to say
at this point.

18:16.962 --> 18:18.764
{\an1}I love you, man,
we gonna end this all,

18:18.831 --> 18:21.200
{\an1}you know what I'm saying?
Here, man.

18:25.737 --> 18:27.573
{\an1}Lift your hair up, baby.
This the big one right here.

18:27.639 --> 18:30.409
This one right here cost
5,000 just for one ruby.

18:30.476 --> 18:32.511
And this right here,
this is my trust in you.

18:32.578 --> 18:35.380
This is a new beginning,
you know what I'm saying?

18:35.447 --> 18:37.149
Oh, my God.

18:38.550 --> 18:40.352
It's done, man.

18:40.419 --> 18:42.754
{\an4}I don't wanna talk about her
no more, okay?

18:40.419 --> 18:42.754
Mm-hmm.

18:42.821 --> 18:46.592
{\an7}And I love you for holding me
down and sticking with me.

18:46.658 --> 18:47.693
Oh, my God.

18:47.759 --> 18:49.094
{\an1}Look at that thing
sitting up on that--

18:49.161 --> 18:51.196
Oh, my God. Rubies.

18:51.263 --> 18:53.765
{\an1}Rubies.

18:53.832 --> 18:54.766
I love you.

19:05.143 --> 19:06.845
(Miles)
I should be happy right now.

19:06.912 --> 19:08.146
Me and Milan
are at the best place

19:08.213 --> 19:09.982
we've probably ever been
in our relationship.

19:10.048 --> 19:12.584
{\an8}We even decided to give
this whole living thing
together a try.

19:13.952 --> 19:15.921
{\an5}What's up, babe?

19:13.952 --> 19:15.921
{\an3}(groans)

19:18.123 --> 19:20.158
{\an5}Give me a kiss.

19:18.123 --> 19:20.158
{\an3}Last one.

19:20.225 --> 19:22.728
{\an5}(Miles) But I can't help
but keep thinking about
my lunch with Amber

19:22.794 --> 19:24.229
and how much I'm hurting her.

19:24.296 --> 19:26.031
Are you happy now?

19:26.098 --> 19:27.432
Yeah, I'm happy.
Are you happy?

19:27.499 --> 19:29.334
{\an1}Yeah, I done
got this tattoo.

19:29.401 --> 19:31.403
You done got your tattoo.

19:31.470 --> 19:33.505
{\an1}What you been thinking about
the last couple of days?

19:33.572 --> 19:36.074
{\an1}You been like--
like hella distance.

19:36.141 --> 19:38.710
Well, you know,
me moving here.

19:38.777 --> 19:39.778
Amber lived
down the street.

19:39.845 --> 19:41.313
{\an1}Right.

19:41.380 --> 19:43.982
{\an1}You know, I don't know how she
gonna react to it, but...

19:44.049 --> 19:45.584
{\an1}How do you think
she's gonna react?

19:45.651 --> 19:48.086
{\an1}Amber could walk outta my life
and we won't be friends.

19:48.153 --> 19:49.788
She could hate me,
I could ruin a girl's life

19:49.855 --> 19:50.989
behind something like this.

19:51.056 --> 19:51.990
You think so?

19:52.057 --> 19:54.026
{\an6}You don't?

19:52.057 --> 19:54.026
{\an1}Nope.

19:54.092 --> 19:56.128
{\an8}Listen, I don't got nothing
against this girl Amber.

19:56.194 --> 19:58.297
{\an8}But let's be clear,
she is his ex.

19:58.363 --> 20:00.265
I don't know why
Miles is so concerned

20:00.332 --> 20:02.334
about telling her about him
coming out

20:02.401 --> 20:04.536
When they haven't
been together for years.

20:04.603 --> 20:06.104
I don't get what
the big deal is.

20:06.171 --> 20:08.006
{\an1}It would be different
if you were still seeing her

20:08.073 --> 20:09.675
{\an1}and you were
trying to tell her, like,

20:09.741 --> 20:11.276
{\an5}that would be different.

20:09.741 --> 20:11.276
I still have love
for Amber, Milan.

20:11.343 --> 20:12.744
{\an5}I understand that,

20:11.343 --> 20:12.744
{\an3}I-I-I...

20:12.811 --> 20:14.513
{\an1}but if you're not in
a relationship with somebody,

20:14.580 --> 20:16.515
{\an1}you've moved on and you're
still struggling

20:16.582 --> 20:18.884
with telling her you're
in another relationship,

20:18.951 --> 20:20.719
{\an4}yeah--

20:18.951 --> 20:20.719
I don't know what
I'm a tell her.

20:20.786 --> 20:22.387
I don't know
how I'm a tell her.

20:22.454 --> 20:23.789
I just need
to figure it out.

20:23.855 --> 20:24.890
{\an1}So, I'm saying,
are you gonna say,

20:24.957 --> 20:27.492
{\an1}"I have feelings
for a guy before"?

20:27.559 --> 20:28.694
I don't know what
I'm a tell her.

20:28.760 --> 20:30.028
{\an5}I don't know.

20:28.760 --> 20:30.028
Or are you gonna tell her,

20:30.095 --> 20:31.330
{\an1}"I live with Milan down
the street from your house"?

20:31.396 --> 20:33.799
This has been the biggest
struggle for me.

20:33.865 --> 20:34.900
You know that.

20:34.967 --> 20:36.335
{\an1}You so concerned about
the world, like,

20:36.401 --> 20:38.003
{\an1}what they--
what they think.

20:38.070 --> 20:39.171
{\an5}I'm not worried
about nobody.

20:38.070 --> 20:39.171
As a matter of fact,

20:39.237 --> 20:40.339
{\an1}you're not even
concerned about the world,

20:40.405 --> 20:41.640
you're more concerned
about (bleep) Amber,

20:41.707 --> 20:44.242
{\an1}somebody who you
allegedly have not been with.

20:44.309 --> 20:45.877
Somebody who I allegedly

20:45.944 --> 20:48.513
was in love with
for a long time.

20:48.580 --> 20:49.815
You so full of (bleep).

20:49.881 --> 20:50.782
{\an1}I'm a tell her
when I'm ready to tell her.

20:50.849 --> 20:51.850
{\an4}Okay.

20:50.849 --> 20:51.850
How about that?

20:51.917 --> 20:52.784
That's gonna be
the one thing that--

20:52.851 --> 20:53.952
It needs to be soon

20:54.019 --> 20:55.520
or I'm gonna call her
and tell her myself.

20:55.587 --> 20:56.688
{\an1}And if you call her and
tell her, then you lose me.

20:56.755 --> 20:58.290
Then, oh well.

20:58.357 --> 20:59.391
I know Milan is right.

20:59.458 --> 21:00.826
I do need to tell Amber.

21:00.892 --> 21:03.462
And I need to do it now,
while it's still my decision,

21:03.528 --> 21:04.963
before she hears
it from somebody else.

21:05.030 --> 21:07.366
I owe it to Amber for the years
that we spent together.

21:07.432 --> 21:09.267
And I owe it to Milan
so we can move forward

21:09.334 --> 21:10.268
with our relationship.

21:10.335 --> 21:11.570
So that's it.

21:11.637 --> 21:13.372
I'm a do it.

21:13.438 --> 21:15.507
I'm a go to
her house,

21:15.574 --> 21:16.942
and I'm a tell her.

21:18.410 --> 21:19.478
Tonight.

21:19.544 --> 21:20.912
Milan, just.. chill.

21:20.979 --> 21:22.547
{\an5}Cool. Cool.

21:20.979 --> 21:22.547
I need to figure this out.

21:22.614 --> 21:23.915
{\an6}All right?

to focus on the video

Princess got me

talking about her and Princess

22:05.824 --> 22:07.359
is cool and they friends
and (bleep).

22:07.426 --> 22:09.561
So what'd Teairra
tell you though?

22:09.628 --> 22:11.963
I get a text from Teairra
forwarding me over

22:12.030 --> 22:13.298
a text from Princess,

22:13.365 --> 22:15.367
and Princess
invite her to Vegas.

22:15.434 --> 22:16.968

22:19.404 --> 22:20.672
So, you think you
believe Teairra?

22:20.739 --> 22:22.240
Well, I'm just
trying to figure it out.

22:22.307 --> 22:24.142
Like, is it real?
Is it fake?

22:24.209 --> 22:25.510
Is it some bull(bleep)?

22:25.577 --> 22:27.813
{\an1}Well, who's to say what
she ain't telling you is real?

22:27.879 --> 22:30.015
She only just
helping me expose

22:30.082 --> 22:31.883
either who Princess
really is,

22:31.950 --> 22:33.118
or if she lying.

{\an1}Listen, I'm a keep it 100

{\an1}Princess took you
from Teairra.

22:39.091 --> 22:41.026
{\an1}I wouldn't be surprised
if Teairra was trying to take

22:41.093 --> 22:43.662
Princess from you.

22:43.729 --> 22:45.864
{\an5}Know what they say, right?

22:43.729 --> 22:45.864
{\an3}What?

22:45.931 --> 22:48.166
{\an1}You lose 'em the same
way you get 'em.

22:48.233 --> 22:49.334
So, I gotta try to get to
the bottom of it

22:49.401 --> 22:50.769
and find the truth.

22:50.836 --> 22:53.505
I don't know if Teairra
is looking out for me or not,

22:53.572 --> 22:55.240
but if what she's
saying is true,

22:55.307 --> 22:58.176
Then Princess is on some
shady ass (bleep).

22:58.243 --> 22:59.811
I'm starting not
to trust Princess.

22:59.878 --> 23:00.946

trust somebody

23:01.012 --> 23:03.048
then your whole
relationship (bleep) up.

23:03.115 --> 23:06.852
So, at the end of the day,
what I'm a do...

23:06.918 --> 23:09.121
I'm a take Princess
to Miami with us,

23:09.187 --> 23:11.256

I'm a trust in God.

23:14.292 --> 23:16.795
If Princess is 100,
it's gonna be right.

23:16.862 --> 23:19.498
If she not, she gonna
get exposed. Period.

You haven't talked

{\an1}Back at home I worked
and I'm not saying that,

27:16.201 --> 27:17.635

because I know he doesn't
normally do this type of thing.

are you dating?

27:41.092 --> 27:43.261
{\an5}Yes, absolutely.

{\an6}Okay.

27:44.796 --> 27:46.297
I'm not gonna lie.

27:46.364 --> 27:48.900

wind of your name,

27:48.967 --> 27:49.901
{\an3}Mhm.

27:49.968 --> 27:52.137
There's a reputation.

27:52.203 --> 27:53.671
What is that reputation?

27:53.738 --> 27:55.040
{\an1}You know, dude,
come on.

27:55.106 --> 27:56.474
What is
the reputation?

27:56.541 --> 27:57.842
{\an5}Because I mean--

27:56.541 --> 27:57.842
{\an1}A player.

27:57.909 --> 28:00.412
{\an1}And to be honest with you,
if you have that reputation,

28:00.478 --> 28:01.846
is there a future?

28:01.913 --> 28:04.482
How do we move past this
and start to get into cheers?

28:04.549 --> 28:07.886
{\an1}Could you please
allow me to talk to Rich?

28:07.952 --> 28:09.754
You're 40 and I'm 47.

28:09.821 --> 28:12.290
{\an5}About to be 40.

28:09.821 --> 28:12.290

us kind of peers

28:12.357 --> 28:14.359
and her still young.

28:14.426 --> 28:15.427
Can I just call you 40?

28:15.493 --> 28:16.694
{\an5}Since we're both...

28:15.493 --> 28:16.694
{\an3}Absolutely.

28:16.761 --> 28:17.862
Knock yourself out.

28:17.929 --> 28:19.631
{\an1}And we might as well
call her 30.

28:19.697 --> 28:21.900
{\an1}'Cause I'm all about rounding
to the highest number.

28:21.966 --> 28:23.301
So you're technically 50.

28:23.368 --> 28:25.003
{\an1}What?!

28:25.070 --> 28:27.639
We can do this.

28:27.705 --> 28:29.074
Or we can do this.

28:29.140 --> 28:30.942
{\an8}Okay, I did my research

28:31.009 --> 28:32.877
{\an8}and the first thing
that jumps out at me

28:32.944 --> 28:35.280
{\an8}is that Rich
has been arrested

28:35.346 --> 28:36.881
{\an8}for not paying his
child support.

28:36.948 --> 28:39.384
I don't even know why you put
dollar on the end of his name

28:39.451 --> 28:41.352
'cause he's certainly not
giving them to his kids.

28:41.419 --> 28:42.821
And I was a little concerned

28:42.887 --> 28:46.491
{\an1}And you can address this,
however you like.

28:46.558 --> 28:50.061
{\an1}The child support thing came up
during my investigation.

28:50.128 --> 28:51.763
And that's a big thing for me.

28:51.830 --> 28:52.997
Let's move on
from that.

28:53.064 --> 28:54.999
No we can't move on
because no you've opened

28:55.066 --> 28:57.502
Pandora's box and that's--
now I'm offended

28:57.569 --> 28:59.571
{\an5}because at the end
of the day...

28:57.569 --> 28:59.571
I've offended you?

28:59.637 --> 29:01.139
Absolutely.
I don't know you.

29:01.206 --> 29:04.042
{\an1}You don't know me
to question my relationships.

29:04.109 --> 29:05.743
{\an8}Marla's child support comment

29:05.810 --> 29:07.512
{\an8}was a jab and it
was below the belt.

29:07.579 --> 29:09.881
{\an8}She's speaking about something
she knows nothing about.

29:09.948 --> 29:12.050
My face has been plastered
all over the blogs

29:12.117 --> 29:13.184
for this child support issue.

29:13.251 --> 29:14.552
But what people
don't know,

29:14.619 --> 29:16.421
I could have sent
my child to Fisk University

29:16.488 --> 29:18.790
with the amount of child support
I paid this year alone.

29:18.857 --> 29:21.126
So, I've been more than
taking care of my baby's mom

29:21.192 --> 29:22.494
<i>and</i> my child.

29:22.560 --> 29:24.395
Not that Marla would know
anything about that.

29:24.462 --> 29:26.831
I don't understand how one
can sit at a table

29:26.898 --> 29:29.200
and judge based on
some internet drama

29:29.267 --> 29:32.270
when your relationship with your
daughter is pretty much (bleep).

29:32.337 --> 29:33.271
Did you just meet me?

29:33.338 --> 29:34.873
I'm laying with this woman

29:34.939 --> 29:36.641
and listening to her
issues on why she

29:36.708 --> 29:39.511
{\an1}doesn't have the relationship
she wants with her mother.

29:39.577 --> 29:41.446
Before we can
cast stones

29:41.513 --> 29:43.448
{\an1}we need to recognize the type
of house we live in.

29:43.515 --> 29:44.883
{\an1}Uh-huh.

29:44.949 --> 29:46.851
And if it's glass,
you might want to refrain.

29:46.918 --> 29:48.686
{\an1}Well, mine's not glass,
it's concrete.

29:48.753 --> 29:49.754
So why don't
you find out?

29:49.821 --> 29:51.189
I don't have to
figure out anything.

29:51.256 --> 29:52.624
{\an1}I'm a grown man, I can go back
to New York tomorrow

29:52.690 --> 29:53.858
and live life.

29:53.925 --> 29:55.193
I was really hoping
that for one night

29:55.260 --> 29:57.061
my mom could
put her guns away

29:57.128 --> 30:00.498
and get along with somebody
who's really important to me.

30:00.565 --> 30:02.634
But, I guess not.

30:02.700 --> 30:04.102
(irritated scream)

30:05.203 --> 30:06.404
{\an5}Really, Moniece?

30:05.203 --> 30:06.404
Yeah, really.

30:06.471 --> 30:09.140
This whole thing is about to be
for nothing.

30:09.207 --> 30:10.742
For me this was
supposed to be

30:10.808 --> 30:12.777
{\an1}a few people,
getting to know one another.

30:12.844 --> 30:15.346
I wasn't looking to go
deep into my past

30:15.413 --> 30:17.148
and for you to question
my relationships,

30:17.215 --> 30:19.417
because if your
daughter's happy

30:19.484 --> 30:21.719
then under them circumstances
you should be happy as well.

30:21.786 --> 30:24.956
{\an1}Thank you for agreeing
to meet me.

30:25.023 --> 30:26.691
{\an1}I'm going to take
what you've given me

30:26.758 --> 30:27.992
as a start.

30:28.059 --> 30:28.960
And I'm going to take
what you've give me

30:29.027 --> 30:29.994
and make it an end it.

30:34.365 --> 30:36.901
{\an7}I would do anything for my kids
and I'll be God damned

30:36.968 --> 30:39.003
{\an8}if they can't
have what they need

30:39.070 --> 30:41.506
{\an8}and what they want because
I'm a provider as well.

30:41.573 --> 30:43.775
{\an7}You're not going back
to doing that.

30:43.841 --> 30:47.178
{\an8}In order for you
to realize what you have

30:47.245 --> 30:48.813
{\an8}you have to
be without me.

30:48.880 --> 30:50.481
{\an8}(bleep) foul, man.

30:53.751 --> 30:55.720
{\an8}You a bitch ass (bleep).

{\an8}(Shanda)
When Willie
and I moved to L.A.,

31:07.498 --> 31:09.701
we figured we could live off
of our savings for six months.

31:09.767 --> 31:11.202
But, man, I never thought
it was this tough

31:11.269 --> 31:12.503
to make the math work.

31:12.570 --> 31:14.272
I'm getting really
worried about my family.

31:14.339 --> 31:15.707
We got kids to provide for.

31:15.773 --> 31:17.208
{\an3}'Sup, babe.

31:17.275 --> 31:18.209
{\an1}Hey.

31:18.276 --> 31:20.712
{\an1}Can I talk to you
for a minute?

31:20.778 --> 31:23.414
See these bills?
It's making me nervous.

31:23.481 --> 31:25.283
Why you nervous?

31:25.350 --> 31:26.484
'Cause they're not paid.

31:26.551 --> 31:29.153
We are definitely
way lower than I expected

31:29.220 --> 31:30.455
by this time.

31:30.521 --> 31:32.991
{\an8}We got (bleep)
past due balances.

31:33.057 --> 31:34.959
{\an1}See, some of these things
ain't gonna be paid on time,

31:35.026 --> 31:36.327
if I could be honest with you.

31:36.394 --> 31:38.563
{\an1}However, I'm not gonna let none
of these things get cut off.

31:38.630 --> 31:39.764
{\an1}Everything that's in front of
you right now

31:39.831 --> 31:40.965
I'm going to pay it.

31:41.032 --> 31:42.400
{\an4}Even if--

31:41.032 --> 31:42.400
This one's
a past due payment.

31:42.467 --> 31:43.768
Okay, and even if--

31:43.835 --> 31:45.169
Okay, so that mother(bleep)

31:45.236 --> 31:46.738
is a different color
than these mother(bleep).

31:46.804 --> 31:48.339
{\an5}So, that means this
mother(bleep) is about
to get cut off.

31:48.406 --> 31:50.541
{\an5}So can you pay
it right now?

31:48.406 --> 31:50.541
{\an1}Is it off?

31:50.608 --> 31:52.043
Hell, we got a couple
more days.

31:52.110 --> 31:54.345
{\an1}Okay, well I got a couple more
days to go get it, don't I?

31:54.412 --> 31:55.747
(Willie)
I know money is tight,

31:55.813 --> 31:57.882
but we both did when we made
that move to come out here.

31:57.949 --> 31:59.250
{\an8}But sometimes I don't think
Shanda can see the light

31:59.317 --> 32:00.385
{\an8}at the end of the tunnel

32:00.451 --> 32:02.320
{\an8}Especially with all
these bills in her face.

32:02.387 --> 32:03.321
{\an7}I'm making money,
Shanda, but--

32:03.388 --> 32:05.056
right now, I'm telling you.

32:05.123 --> 32:06.524
Where is it?

32:06.591 --> 32:09.560
Because I can go out and I can
actually make money every day.

32:09.627 --> 32:11.429
Because guess what,
my children need money

32:11.496 --> 32:13.731
<i>every single day.</i>

32:13.798 --> 32:14.799
{\an1}I don't-- I haven't
asked for your help now.

32:14.866 --> 32:16.000
You don't
have to ask.

32:16.067 --> 32:17.435
I know what the (bleep)
we're dealing with.

32:17.502 --> 32:18.436
Okay, so lets--

32:18.503 --> 32:19.871
You don't have to
(bleep) ask.

32:19.937 --> 32:22.140
{\an1}However, you're not
going back to doing that.

32:22.206 --> 32:24.208
My priorities
are my children.

32:24.275 --> 32:25.643
{\an1}My priorities
are my children too.

32:25.710 --> 32:26.844
I would do anything
for my kids

32:26.911 --> 32:29.681
and I'll be God damned
if they can't

32:29.747 --> 32:31.516
have what they need
and what they want

32:31.582 --> 32:33.284
because I'm a provider
as well.

32:33.351 --> 32:36.187
Back in Chicago, Shanda used to
dance before the kids were born.

32:36.254 --> 32:38.323
Now that we're in L.A.
it's a whole new leaf.

32:38.389 --> 32:39.891
I'm not even trying to
entertain the thought

32:39.957 --> 32:41.492
of her going back to that,
ya mean, I suffered

32:41.559 --> 32:43.428
enough with it, just even
dealing with it mentally.

32:43.494 --> 32:45.563
So, now I just don't even want
to go down that road anymore.

32:45.630 --> 32:48.299
I love her too much to allow
her to go and do it again.

32:48.366 --> 32:50.201
{\an1}You came out here
to support me and I got you.

32:50.268 --> 32:51.202
{\an1}I want you to
understand that.

32:51.269 --> 32:52.403
I'm not gonna fail you.

32:52.470 --> 32:55.039
{\an1}I'm not gonna fail my kids.
I'm not gonna fail me.

32:55.106 --> 32:57.008
{\an5}We came out here together.

32:55.106 --> 32:57.008
But you gotta understand--
just please listen to me.

32:57.075 --> 32:58.209
{\an5}I understand that.

32:57.075 --> 32:58.209
I want to be able

32:58.276 --> 32:59.377
{\an5}to just do what
I need to do.

32:58.276 --> 32:59.377
{\an1}I get it.

32:59.444 --> 33:00.678
{\an5}I understand you.

32:59.444 --> 33:00.678
I want to help.

33:00.745 --> 33:02.246
{\an1}And that was the way,
not that I just wanna go out

33:02.313 --> 33:03.948
and do that,
but sometimes as a mother

33:04.015 --> 33:06.818
{\an1}you gotta do things that you
wouldn't normally do

33:06.884 --> 33:07.952
for your kids.

33:08.019 --> 33:09.787
They depend on me.

33:09.854 --> 33:11.389
They depend
on us.

33:11.456 --> 33:13.758
I can't just
depend on <i> you.</i>

33:15.960 --> 33:18.229
I have to step in
and do-- be a mother.

33:18.296 --> 33:19.731
{\an4}We can stop
the conversation.

33:18.296 --> 33:19.731
Listen to this.

33:19.797 --> 33:21.632
{\an1}Because we're on our way
to something greater.

33:21.699 --> 33:23.101
{\an5}And I need you--

33:21.699 --> 33:23.101
I understand greater.

33:23.167 --> 33:24.502
{\an5}And I know we are.

33:23.167 --> 33:24.502
{\an1}And I need you
to understand that I get it.

33:24.569 --> 33:26.337
{\an5}But you need my help.

33:24.569 --> 33:26.337
{\an1}And I haven't asked
for your help.

33:26.404 --> 33:27.939
{\an5}You don't
have to ask.

33:26.404 --> 33:27.939
And I'm man enough to ask you.

33:28.005 --> 33:29.240
{\an5}Understand that
I'm man enough.

33:28.005 --> 33:29.240
You don't have to ask.

33:29.307 --> 33:33.077
{\an1}Understand that I'm man
enough to ask you for your help

33:33.144 --> 33:35.146
if I need your help.

33:37.515 --> 33:40.284

34:26.597 --> 34:28.366
Doesn't even
invite me to set.

34:28.433 --> 34:31.068
{\an8}It's almost like he's keeping
me cooped up in the hotel

34:31.135 --> 34:32.837
{\an8}just like he does me at home.

34:32.904 --> 34:34.938
But even though,
I was never actually

34:35.005 --> 34:36.373
going to Vegas with Teairra,

34:36.440 --> 34:38.876
this Miami trip <i> did</i> give me
a reason

34:38.943 --> 34:40.210
to call the Vegas trip off.

34:40.277 --> 34:42.513
And now I'm just wondering
if the rat trap

34:42.580 --> 34:44.315
really, actually did work.

34:46.583 --> 34:48.052
{\an1}'Sup?

{\an5}(Ray J)
I told Princess that I'll
see her back at the hotel

34:50.154 --> 34:52.489
after my shoot,
but here she is.

34:52.556 --> 34:55.525
When I work, I need to have
my head fully in the game.

34:55.592 --> 34:57.562
But now my mind's back
on Princess

34:57.628 --> 35:00.097
and her shady ass business
she's doing with Teairra.

35:00.164 --> 35:02.400
And I feel like I need to know
some answers.

35:02.467 --> 35:03.401
How's your video shoot?

35:03.468 --> 35:04.635
It's going straight.

35:04.702 --> 35:08.039
{\an1}But at the same time,
I can't stop thinking about

35:08.105 --> 35:11.108
you and all the (bleep)
you not listening to me,

35:11.175 --> 35:12.243
like, telling you.

35:12.310 --> 35:13.578
What am I not
listening to?

35:13.644 --> 35:16.681
{\an1}This you and this
whole Teairra thing.

35:16.747 --> 35:18.115
{\an5}What about it?

35:16.747 --> 35:18.115
What about it?

35:18.182 --> 35:19.951
I told you to stop
(bleep) with her.

35:20.017 --> 35:21.786
{\an6}Okay.

35:20.017 --> 35:21.786
{\an1}And she calling me
telling me,

35:21.853 --> 35:24.121
{\an1}"Okay, I've been
talking to Princess.

35:24.188 --> 35:26.991

trap worked perfectly.

35:34.198 --> 35:36.567
Of course TT
got word back to Ray.

35:36.634 --> 35:38.269

information to him

35:38.336 --> 35:39.504
this whole time.

35:39.570 --> 35:40.505
Playing me.

35:40.571 --> 35:41.839
Let me tell
you something.

35:41.906 --> 35:43.975
{\an3}I asked her

35:44.041 --> 35:46.210
just to see if it
would get back to you.

35:46.277 --> 35:49.313
Why does this girl still
have the ability

35:49.380 --> 35:51.048
to call you whenever
she wants to?

35:51.115 --> 35:52.817
{\an1}She don't got
the ability to call me--

35:52.884 --> 35:55.086
{\an5}Why you keep
communicating with her?

35:52.884 --> 35:55.086
Come on, man.

35:55.152 --> 35:57.321
{\an1}All I'm trying to do is make
(bleep) right with you.

35:57.388 --> 35:58.856
You keep disrespecting me.

35:58.923 --> 36:00.258
No, I've been
keeping it real.

36:00.324 --> 36:01.425
I'm fed up right now.

36:01.492 --> 36:03.828
Now, I set this trap up
for Teairra,

36:03.895 --> 36:05.930
but the fact that
Ray bit the cheese too

36:05.997 --> 36:08.599
just proves to me that
they're both unloyal.

36:08.666 --> 36:10.134
He let me go to jail.

36:10.201 --> 36:12.069
He continuously throws me
under the bus.

36:12.136 --> 36:14.038
And now he's still communicating
with his ex.

36:14.105 --> 36:16.307
Honestly, I don't
even know why

36:16.374 --> 36:17.842
I'm even in this
relationship anymore.

36:17.909 --> 36:19.510
{\an3}I feel like

36:19.577 --> 36:22.380
in order for you
to realize what you have,

36:22.446 --> 36:24.148
you have to be without me.

36:24.215 --> 36:26.851
So, you don't wanna
be with me no more.

36:26.918 --> 36:28.519
I don't wanna be
with you no more.

36:30.688 --> 36:32.890
{\an5}All right, cool.

36:30.688 --> 36:32.890
So, have your hos.

36:32.957 --> 36:34.225
Have your strippers.

36:34.292 --> 36:36.561
And I wish you
the best of luck.

36:36.627 --> 36:37.929
I ain't gonna even lie,

36:37.995 --> 36:40.064
hearing that Princess don't want
to be with me no more,

36:40.131 --> 36:41.232
that's a blow.

36:41.299 --> 36:42.733
But you know what,
she been shady,

36:42.800 --> 36:44.669
and she been doing
some (bleep) up (bleep).

36:44.735 --> 36:46.971
And at this point,
even though I'm hurt,

36:47.038 --> 36:50.107
she ain't the Princess
that I thought she was.

36:50.174 --> 36:51.776
{\an1}Yo, this is
the bottom line.

36:51.842 --> 36:54.378
{\an1}You don't trust me
and I don't trust you.

36:54.445 --> 36:55.780
But, can I tell
you something?

36:55.846 --> 36:59.517
The reason I don't
trust you is because,

36:59.584 --> 37:01.319
{\an3}as a man,

37:01.385 --> 37:04.555
you should never
let your woman go to jail.

37:04.622 --> 37:06.090
I never let you go to jail.

37:06.157 --> 37:08.092
{\an5}You let me go to jail.

37:06.157 --> 37:08.092
Is that right?

37:08.159 --> 37:11.662
And that's when I lost my
respect for you as a man.

37:11.729 --> 37:13.331
That (bleep)
is foul, man.

37:18.069 --> 37:19.637
You a bitch ass (bleep).

37:21.305 --> 37:22.239
{\an8}Miles, just leave.

37:22.306 --> 37:23.240
{\an8}I ain't going
nowhere, (bleep).

37:23.307 --> 37:24.241
{\an8}This my house too.

37:24.308 --> 37:25.576
{\an8}I live here now.

37:24.308 --> 37:25.576
{\an8}Great-- No, you don't.

37:25.643 --> 37:26.577
{\an9}And now--

37:25.643 --> 37:26.577
{\an8}You don't live here.

37:26.644 --> 37:28.079
{\an8}I don't live here?

37:26.644 --> 37:28.079
{\an8}No, you don't.

37:28.145 --> 37:30.781
{\an7}Take all your (bleep)
and get the (bleep) out.

37:38.155 --> 37:41.092
{\an8}♪♪

37:43.361 --> 37:45.329
{\an5}(Miles)
After leaving Ambers house
without telling her,

37:45.396 --> 37:47.098
I couldn't bear
to go home and face Milan,

37:47.164 --> 37:48.899
so I just crashed
at my aunt's house.

37:48.966 --> 37:50.935
He would never
understand how important it is

37:51.002 --> 37:52.703
for me to tell Amber
the right way

37:52.770 --> 37:53.904
at the right place

37:53.971 --> 37:55.139
at the
right time.

37:58.109 --> 37:59.310
{\an3}'Sup?

37:59.377 --> 38:00.711
What's going on?

38:00.778 --> 38:02.947
I knew that Milan was going to
be pissed that we

38:03.014 --> 38:05.016
didn't spend the first
night in the apartment together.

38:05.082 --> 38:07.151
And I can't even tell him why.

38:07.218 --> 38:08.519
What's going on,
where you been?

38:08.586 --> 38:11.956
{\an1}I told you, I was
at my aunt's house.

38:12.023 --> 38:13.524
So, you was at your aunt's
house last night?

38:13.591 --> 38:16.093
{\an4}Yes.

38:13.591 --> 38:16.093
What time you was
at your aunt's house?

38:16.160 --> 38:17.928
(sighing) All day.

38:17.995 --> 38:19.563
So, you're gonna
sit here and lie?

38:19.630 --> 38:21.165
Lie about what?

38:21.232 --> 38:23.100
{\an1}When was the last time
you seen Amber?

38:23.167 --> 38:25.536
Uh, the other day.

38:25.603 --> 38:26.704
{\an1}The other day,
like last night?

38:26.771 --> 38:28.506
No, I went to
my aunt's house.

38:28.572 --> 38:30.174
Stop (bleep) lying!

38:30.241 --> 38:32.610
{\an6}About what?

38:30.241 --> 38:32.610
{\an1}You were-- You were not
at your (bleep) aunt's house

38:32.677 --> 38:33.911
{\an5}last night, Miles.

38:32.677 --> 38:33.911
Hold on, hold on,
chill out.

38:33.978 --> 38:35.680
I (bleep) followed you.

38:35.746 --> 38:39.417
{\an5}Followed me where?

38:35.746 --> 38:39.417
{\an1}I followed you
to Amber's house.

38:39.483 --> 38:41.485
{\an5}You followed me?

38:39.483 --> 38:41.485
What do you want from me?

38:41.552 --> 38:44.355
{\an5}I give you every (bleep) thing.

38:41.552 --> 38:44.355
When I went to
Amber's house..

38:44.422 --> 38:46.123
{\an5}I give you my body.
I give you my soul.

38:44.422 --> 38:46.123
I didn't-- I didn't...

38:46.190 --> 38:48.426
{\an1}I give you every (bleep)
thing you asked for.

38:48.492 --> 38:51.328
{\an1}What is it she's giving you
that I can't give you?

38:51.395 --> 38:53.964
If you followed me
to Amber's last night,

38:54.031 --> 38:56.333
{\an1}and if you just drove by and you
just followed me over there,

38:56.400 --> 38:58.436
you should have stayed
because I didn't go in.

38:58.502 --> 39:00.738
{\an1}You drove to her house,
you parked the car.

39:00.805 --> 39:01.872
I didn't go in at all.

39:01.939 --> 39:03.808
Shut the (bleep) up
if you're gonna lie!

39:03.874 --> 39:05.376
I didn't go in.
Call Amber right now.

39:05.443 --> 39:06.510
Miles, just leave.

39:06.577 --> 39:07.745
{\an1}I'm done with
this whole thing.

39:07.812 --> 39:08.879
{\an1}Just go.

39:08.946 --> 39:09.747
I ain't going
nowhere, (bleep).

39:09.814 --> 39:10.848
This my house too.

39:10.915 --> 39:12.316
{\an5}I live here now.

39:10.915 --> 39:12.316
Great-- no, you don't.

39:12.383 --> 39:13.551
{\an6}And now...

39:12.383 --> 39:13.551
You don't live here.

39:13.617 --> 39:14.552
I don't live here?

39:14.618 --> 39:16.721
No, you don't.

39:16.787 --> 39:17.788
{\an3}So...

39:17.855 --> 39:19.523
So... get the (bleep) out.

39:19.590 --> 39:20.524
Is that what you want?

39:20.591 --> 39:21.726
Miles, just leave.

39:21.792 --> 39:23.394
{\an5}Is that what you want?

39:21.792 --> 39:23.394
Come on, just go.

39:23.461 --> 39:25.396
You went to Amber's house
and you lied and told me

39:25.463 --> 39:26.764
{\an1}you was at your
aunt's house.

39:26.831 --> 39:28.499
There's nothing else
for us to talk about.

39:28.566 --> 39:30.735
{\an1}I don't give a (bleep)
what you went to her house for.

39:30.801 --> 39:31.969
You're a (bleep) liar.

39:32.036 --> 39:33.437
Who wouldn't be mad
if their boyfriend

39:33.504 --> 39:35.339
went to their ex's house
and lied about it?

39:35.406 --> 39:38.375
You know, it doesn't matter what
happen or didn't happen,

39:38.442 --> 39:39.944
I just can't trust
Miles anymore.

39:40.010 --> 39:41.178
And that's why I'm done.

39:41.245 --> 39:43.714
{\an1}Take all your (bleep)
and get the (bleep) out.

39:43.781 --> 39:45.483
Touch my (bleep),
all right, for sure.

39:45.549 --> 39:46.584
Well get your
(bleep) out too.

39:46.650 --> 39:47.685
I guess everybody
moving then.

39:47.752 --> 39:48.786
We moving y'all.

39:48.853 --> 39:50.788
For sure, for sure,
we moving.

39:50.855 --> 39:52.256
{\an5}Punk bitch.

39:50.855 --> 39:52.256
Yeah, great.

39:53.624 --> 39:54.892
Open the door.

39:54.959 --> 39:56.327
Open the door.

39:56.393 --> 39:57.328
(loud kick)

40:07.371 --> 40:09.073
{\an8}(man)
Next time on
"Love &amp; Hip Hop Hollywood"

40:09.140 --> 40:10.775
{\an8}Have you been in contact
with Ray?

40:10.841 --> 40:12.409
{\an8}Yeah, I sent him
a text message.

40:12.476 --> 40:13.811
{\an8}You're a (bleep) up person.

40:13.878 --> 40:15.279
{\an8}I'm a (bleep) up person?

40:13.878 --> 40:15.279
{\an8}You're a (bleep) up person.

40:15.346 --> 40:16.914
{\an8}You're unloyal
to everybody.

40:15.346 --> 40:16.914
{\an4}Oh.

40:16.981 --> 40:18.382
{\an8}Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.

40:18.449 --> 40:21.152
{\an7}Bitch, I will (bleep) you up.
Don't (bleep) with me.

40:21.218 --> 40:22.653
{\an8}I think that was really,

40:22.720 --> 40:24.488
{\an7}really, really
a sucker ass move.

40:22.720 --> 40:24.488
{\an5}But you weren't there.

40:24.555 --> 40:27.191
{\an8}It doesn't matter.
You don't throw...

40:24.555 --> 40:27.191
{\an5}You weren-- listen.

40:27.258 --> 40:28.559
{\an8}... a drink at a woman.

40:27.258 --> 40:28.559
{\an8}I'm not gonna talk
to your Chihuahua.

40:29.693 --> 40:31.662
{\an8}I feel like we need plan B.

40:31.729 --> 40:34.598
{\an7}Like, do you feel like we should
just go back to Chicago?

40:35.699 --> 40:37.134
{\an8}Something is going on, Amber.

40:37.201 --> 40:38.903
{\an7}I'm going to tell you
to open your eyes, baby.

40:38.969 --> 40:40.304
{\an8}I know you love him.

40:40.371 --> 40:41.672
{\an8}We've been talking
about counseling.

40:41.739 --> 40:44.408
{\an7}And, honestly, Angel, I do
think that's the first step.

40:44.475 --> 40:46.610
{\an8}I've had feelings
towards the same sex.

40:46.677 --> 40:49.613
{\an7}The main reason you
wanted to come here today...

40:49.680 --> 40:52.683
{\an8}You want Amber to come,
and you want to tell her

40:52.750 --> 40:54.118
{\an8}all of this.

40:52.750 --> 40:54.118
{\an9}Yes.

40:54.185 --> 40:57.521
{\an7}And can you imagine what kind of
a pill that's going to be

40:57.588 --> 40:58.756
{\an8}for her to swallow?

40:58.823 --> 41:00.157
{\an8}(door bell ringing)

41:00.224 --> 41:01.458
{\an7}All right,
are you ready?
