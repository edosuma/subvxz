How many numbers?

07:57.009 --> 07:58.644
- Still two.

07:58.711 --> 08:00.213
- Okay, I don't
think you can see.

08:00.279 --> 08:02.215
- Is that a practical prank?

08:02.281 --> 08:03.683
- I think he's good.

08:03.749 --> 08:05.117
We're live!

- Tell me when.
- One, two, swing.

08:14.393 --> 08:17.163

08:17.230 --> 08:18.364
- The mirror.
- The golf cart.

08:18.431 --> 08:20.333
- Swing!
- Oooh!

08:20.399 --> 08:22.635

It hit me in the head.

08:22.702 --> 08:23.870
- Yeah, I'm just
gonna basically--yep.

08:23.936 --> 08:25.838
- What are you doing?
- Oh, what?

08:25.905 --> 08:28.574
Absolutely not! No!

08:28.641 --> 08:30.543
- I knew that was gonna happen.

08:30.610 --> 08:32.410
- One, two, swing.

08:32.477 --> 08:34.947
- ALL: [cheering]

08:35.014 --> 08:36.381
- Not bad.

08:36.448 --> 08:39.251
- You absolutely
exploded that thing!

08:39.318 --> 08:41.354
- Am I done? How'd I do?
- Not bad.

08:41.419 --> 08:43.089
How many I'd hit?
- One for three.

08:43.155 --> 08:44.557
Hey, in baseball--
- One for three?

08:44.624 --> 08:45.691
- That's a great percentage.

08:45.758 --> 08:47.426
Alright, cool, Cobs, hop on out.

08:47.493 --> 08:49.262
Cor, you're in the swing seat.

08:49.328 --> 08:50.696
I'll be driving.

08:50.763 --> 08:53.032
- Hit me with that blindfold.
- Cor, you sure you don't--

08:53.099 --> 08:54.200
- No, I'll take Ty.
- Okay.

08:54.267 --> 08:56.402
- ♪

08:56.469 --> 08:58.170
- You know, Cobs
went one for the three.

08:58.237 --> 08:59.739
And I think Ty and I
can take that.

08:59.805 --> 09:01.941
We're busting
at least two piñatas.

09:02.008 --> 09:04.043
And more importantly,
I'm getting the good candy.

09:04.110 --> 09:08.080
- Absolutely.

Look, you got candy in the cart.

09:32.538 --> 09:33.606

09:38.377 --> 09:39.512
- Our mirror.

09:39.578 --> 09:41.213
There's literally nothing left.

09:41.280 --> 09:42.815
Congratulations, Cor.

09:42.882 --> 09:45.484
The best birthday bro winner,
well done.

09:45.551 --> 09:47.887
I gotta say, that's how
you celebrate a birthday.

09:47.954 --> 09:49.722
- Seriously.
- And also how you

09:49.789 --> 09:51.824
guarantee yourself
seven years of bad luck.

09:51.891 --> 09:54.026
But a good way
to celebrate a birthday.

09:54.093 --> 09:56.395
Before I forget, I got
one more thing for you guys.

09:56.462 --> 09:57.663
I'll be right back.

09:57.730 --> 10:00.333
Happy Birthday, twins!

10:00.399 --> 10:02.601
- Oh my gosh, dude,
that is so legit.

10:02.668 --> 10:04.603
- Got you guys
a little cake action.

10:04.670 --> 10:06.439
Even put "Happy Birthday"
on there.

10:06.505 --> 10:08.274
What do you think?
- That's incredible.

10:08.341 --> 10:10.343
- What flavor is it?

- No way!

10:12.445 --> 10:14.780
- With a Panda surprise.

10:14.847 --> 10:16.115
- I actually didn't know that.

10:16.182 --> 10:17.616
That scared me a lot.

10:17.683 --> 10:19.285
- You guys outdid yourselves
all day.

10:19.352 --> 10:22.121
I mean, topping it off with
a birthday cake with Panda.

10:22.188 --> 10:24.957
- Just wait. There's more.

10:25.024 --> 10:26.459
- Really?
- No way.

10:26.525 --> 10:28.427
- I can't--I can't go too fast.

10:28.494 --> 10:29.862
- Is there a panda in there?

10:29.929 --> 10:31.597
- [applause]

- Blow out your candles, boys.

- Happy--three, two,
one--Happy Birthday!

10:41.173 --> 10:43.476
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, you got caked.

10:43.542 --> 10:46.545
- Happy Birthday!
- I didn't get Coby very good.

10:46.612 --> 10:48.214
- I should have known
something was coming.

10:48.280 --> 10:51.083
I will say, that was
my first taste of the cake.

10:51.150 --> 10:53.853
- And it is phenomenal!
- And it's pretty good.

10:53.919 --> 10:55.721
- Seriously, guys, that was
a great birthday, thank you.

10:55.788 --> 10:57.356
- Absolutely, man.
You guys deserve it.

10:57.423 --> 10:58.691
- Appreciate that.

10:58.758 --> 11:00.860
- Oh, you think we should
get Panda out of the cake?

11:00.926 --> 11:02.728
- You're good, Panda.
- Just shimmy.

11:05.431 --> 11:07.099
{\an8}- Cods, you're kind of
a bad dancer.

11:07.166 --> 11:08.234
{\an8}- What, me?

11:08.300 --> 11:10.236
{\an8}- You're gonna be
dancing with Kelsie today.

11:10.302 --> 11:11.971
{\an8}- Hey, Kels.

11:13.239 --> 11:14.907
{\an8}- Oh my gosh.

11:17.109 --> 11:18.844
- What's up, guys? Welcome to
"The Dude Perfect Show."

11:18.911 --> 11:20.179
I recently became a father.

11:20.246 --> 11:21.747
My daughter, Landry,
she's a beautiful little girl.

11:21.814 --> 11:23.816
But my biggest fear is
being an embarrassing dad.

11:23.883 --> 11:25.785
- Especially at
those daddy-daughter dances.

11:25.851 --> 11:27.920
I can see that being a true
stumbling block for you.

11:27.987 --> 11:29.622
You're kind of a bad dancer.
- Me?

11:29.688 --> 11:30.756
Are you kidding? No way.

11:30.823 --> 11:32.158
- Watch the hands.

11:32.224 --> 11:35.561
You're kinda--that, see,
this is what I'm talking about.

11:35.628 --> 11:37.863
Okay, look at this right here.

11:37.930 --> 11:41.100
This is Panda saying,
"This is how it's done."

11:41.167 --> 11:42.835
You're not doing
the same thing at all.

11:42.902 --> 11:44.203
- I'm doing the same thing.

11:44.270 --> 11:46.038
- You think you're doing
the same thing, you're not.

11:46.105 --> 11:48.007
- This is Exhibit A.
- Point proven.

11:48.074 --> 11:50.976
- So, we put some
training exercises together.

11:51.043 --> 11:52.878
Which you're gonna love,
by the way.

11:52.945 --> 11:54.413
To just improve
your little dance skills.

11:54.480 --> 11:55.448
- Don't wanna embarrass Landry.

11:55.514 --> 11:56.582
Don't wanna embarrass you.

11:56.649 --> 11:58.250
- Cool. Let's dance
out of here then.

11:58.317 --> 12:00.352
- Oh, oh.

12:00.419 --> 12:02.655
- Don't mind the hips.
They have a mind of their own.

12:02.721 --> 12:03.522
- Guy's unbelievable.

12:03.589 --> 12:04.824
- [laughs]

12:07.326 --> 12:11.530

- Cods,
welcome to the DP Dance Studio,

a little bit different.

12:15.267 --> 12:17.336
- Ah.
- We've got our helper Kelsie.

12:17.403 --> 12:19.438
She's gonna be helping us out,

- Mm, that's nice.
- Yeah.

12:25.411 --> 12:26.579

- Cods, do you remember
back in prom, dude?

12:29.915 --> 12:31.183
- Yep.
- It was awkward.

12:31.250 --> 12:32.284
- Very.

12:32.351 --> 12:33.953
- Was it?
We weren't there for your prom.

12:34.019 --> 12:35.521
- Oh, what?
- Was there dancing?

12:35.588 --> 12:36.822
- A little bit of dancing, yes.

12:36.889 --> 12:38.390
- How was the quality
of the dance?

12:38.457 --> 12:40.526
- Uh, very slow.
Very slow music.

12:40.593 --> 12:41.961
Hands up here, down there.

12:42.027 --> 12:44.597

danced like this?

12:44.663 --> 12:46.031
- You kidding me right now?

12:46.098 --> 12:48.033
- That is not the way you dance!

12:48.100 --> 12:50.136
- He's worse than I thought.
Oh boy.

12:50.202 --> 12:52.771
- If you were dancing like that,
I think I know why the dancing

12:52.838 --> 12:54.206
didn't last long.
- Hands on the hips.

12:54.273 --> 12:56.175

dancing with Kelsie today.

- Yep, she's your new prom date.

12:58.677 --> 13:00.513
Got a whole course
lined up for you.

13:00.579 --> 13:02.515
First stage, form and footwork.

13:02.581 --> 13:03.849
That's what we're focusing on.

13:03.916 --> 13:05.317
You're gonna be going
through the tires.

13:05.384 --> 13:10.222
Kelsie will, without warning,
jump in...for a little dance.

13:10.289 --> 13:11.123
Toss her off.

13:11.190 --> 13:12.525
Then once you finish the tires,

13:12.591 --> 13:13.959
you're gonna go
sit down in the chair.

13:14.026 --> 13:15.494
We've got the bucket
with the balloons.

13:15.561 --> 13:16.762
We'll place 'em on your head.

13:16.829 --> 13:18.831
You're gonna have to balance
that on your head as you

13:18.898 --> 13:20.466
go over the three hurdles,
then up the stairs.

13:20.533 --> 13:21.667
- Yikes.

13:21.734 --> 13:23.068
- Okay, grab Kelsie,

and you to find out.

13:28.240 --> 13:30.576

13:41.887 --> 13:44.924
She doesn't even have hair!

13:44.990 --> 13:46.725
She is so embarrassed.

13:46.792 --> 13:49.662
You should be ashamed
of yourself right now.

13:49.728 --> 13:52.631
- GARRETT: It's okay.

13:52.698 --> 13:53.966
- Kelsie, I'm so sorry.

13:54.033 --> 13:56.435
We did not start off
on the right foot.

13:56.502 --> 13:57.870
Or arm.
- [laughs]

13:57.937 --> 13:59.838
Well, Cods, I think
we've learned one more thing.

13:59.905 --> 14:01.640
You need to be
a little bit more gentle

14:01.707 --> 14:04.043
when you're dancing with a girl.
- True.

14:04.109 --> 14:06.145
- So why don't you take Kelsie,
and let's get started.

14:06.212 --> 14:09.415
- Here we go, I think.
Grab her.

14:09.481 --> 14:10.716
- Yep, twirl her five times.

14:10.783 --> 14:14.920
Two and three and four and five.

14:14.987 --> 14:17.456
- And to us.
- Hand her off, perfect.

14:17.523 --> 14:19.592
- And through the tires.
- Get through the tires.

14:19.658 --> 14:21.660
Alright, hold on.
- Here she comes!

14:24.830 --> 14:25.998
Toss her back!
- Oh my God.

14:26.065 --> 14:29.335
- [laughing]
- Okay.

14:29.401 --> 14:31.737
- Put the bowl on your head,
balance it, make your way

14:31.804 --> 14:33.172
through the rest of the course.
- Okay.

14:33.239 --> 14:35.174
- Keep that straight--keep
that nice and tight.

14:35.241 --> 14:37.009
- Keep this neck strong.
- Glide.

14:37.076 --> 14:39.378
Oh, oh!
- Don't touch that.

14:39.445 --> 14:40.579
Oh, that's nice.

14:40.646 --> 14:41.947
- Gl--oh, you're getting weak.

14:42.014 --> 14:44.717
You're getting weak,
I need you to focus. Glide.

14:44.783 --> 14:46.986
- Oh wow, he has
got great form.

14:47.052 --> 14:48.320
Act like you're floating, man.

14:48.387 --> 14:50.389
Floating on the dance floor
right now.

14:50.456 --> 14:52.658
- I do not see how this affects
my dancing abilities

14:52.725 --> 14:54.226
with my daughter.
- Cody--

14:54.293 --> 14:56.228
- The posture's there.
- --embarrass yourself now

14:56.295 --> 14:57.963
so you don't embarrass
your daughter later.

14:58.030 --> 15:00.633
- Ooh! This is high!

15:00.699 --> 15:02.001
- Now give me a twirl.

15:02.067 --> 15:03.736
- Twirling. Got the twirl.

15:03.802 --> 15:05.638
- Raise your hands in victory.

15:05.704 --> 15:07.006
- Yes!

15:07.072 --> 15:08.641
- Course is completed!
- [applause]

15:08.707 --> 15:09.708
- It was amazing.
- Hey!

15:09.775 --> 15:11.410
- Oh no, no!

15:11.477 --> 15:12.478
That was not a bad landing.

15:12.544 --> 15:14.079
- I think we're gonna
give that to him.

15:14.146 --> 15:15.381
- How was that? Was I graceful?

15:15.447 --> 15:17.182
- Yeah, the exit was
a little shaky but--

15:17.249 --> 15:19.318
- Form and footwork
though, thumbs up.

15:19.385 --> 15:20.552
- Definitely,
he made some strides.

15:20.619 --> 15:21.854
- He made strides.
- Thank you.

15:21.920 --> 15:23.455

16:10.069 --> 16:13.238
- Hi, Cody.
- Nice to finally meet you.

16:13.305 --> 16:15.708
- So like I was telling you
over the phone, we tried to put

16:15.774 --> 16:17.810
Cody through some of our own
training, but we've only got

16:17.876 --> 16:21.113
so much that we can give him as
far as knowledge and skillset.

16:21.180 --> 16:24.249
So ideally, what we would like
to do is have Cody perform maybe

16:24.316 --> 16:27.319
a little number with you guys
for his wife and daughter

16:27.386 --> 16:29.154

we're gonna be in a good place.
- Okay.

we've got our ice cream?
