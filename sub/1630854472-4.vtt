15:45.336 --> 15:46.878

MM.

15:55.587 --> 15:57.249
MM MM MM.

15:57.349 --> 15:59.292
IS THERE ANYTHING BETTER
THAN A SWEET CIGAR

15:59.392 --> 16:01.775
WITH A HINT OF
MOCHA AND CARAMEL?

16:01.875 --> 16:04.778
A LAP DANCE FROM STRIPPERS
NAMED MOCHA AND CARAMEL.

16:04.878 --> 16:05.979

BILLY: EVERYBODY

16:54.935 --> 16:56.076
SHE GOT IT.

16:56.176 --> 16:57.958

17:07.268 --> 17:09.171
HA HA HA!

17:09.271 --> 17:10.652
UH...

17:10.752 --> 17:11.814
EVERY WOMAN
SHOULD OWN

17:11.914 --> 17:13.335
AN ELEGANT PIECE
LIKE THAT.

17:13.435 --> 17:15.338
FOR WHAT, TO EAT
WITH LADY BRIDGERTON?

17:15.438 --> 17:17.580
GRACE: THANK YOU,
REESHA--I MEAN REESE.

17:17.680 --> 17:20.544
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

17:20.644 --> 17:22.386
UH...

17:22.486 --> 17:23.867
I DON'T GET IT.

17:23.967 --> 17:27.592
LIKE, YOUR FACE LIT UP
AT A PLASTIC TOY,

17:27.692 --> 17:29.354
BUT YOU BARELY
CRACKED A SMILE

17:29.454 --> 17:30.915
AT A VERY EXPENSIVE
NECKLACE.

17:31.015 --> 17:34.599
THAT'S BECAUSE THE TRUCK
MEANS SOMETHING TO GRACE

17:34.699 --> 17:37.082
BECAUSE IT'S A THROWBACK
TO OUR FIRST GIRLS NIGHT OUT

17:37.182 --> 17:40.526
WHEN GRACE WAS HANGING
OUT OF THE WINDOW DRUNK.

17:40.626 --> 17:44.371
I'M SORRY. MY SISTER HANGING
OUT OF A WINDOW DRINKING?

17:44.471 --> 17:46.052
LAURA: OH, YOU
DON'T EVEN KNOW

17:46.152 --> 17:47.574
THIS VERSION
OF GRACE.

17:47.674 --> 17:49.777
AND THAT WAS
ALSO THE NIGHT

17:49.877 --> 17:51.459
THAT D'ANGELO
SHOT HIS SHOT,

17:51.559 --> 17:53.221
SO WITHOUT
THAT NIGHT, LADIES,

17:53.321 --> 17:55.543
WE MAY NOT HAVE
A WEDDING TOMORROW.

17:55.643 --> 17:57.946
-NO. IT'S TRUE.
-YOU'RE RIGHT.

17:58.046 --> 17:59.387
OH, YEAH.

17:59.487 --> 18:02.911

GONNA GO ON OVER

18:04.653 --> 18:06.716

SO IT'S HER.

18:53.949 --> 18:55.211

19:06.203 --> 19:07.625
COME ON, GUYS.
THAT'S A NO-BRAINER.

19:07.725 --> 19:08.786
I MEAN, LIV WOULD
GIVE UP ANYTHING

19:08.886 --> 19:10.228
FOR THAT JOB,
RIGHT?

19:10.328 --> 19:12.330
-YEAH.
-YEAH.

19:14.132 --> 19:15.674
OK. ALL RIGHT.

19:15.774 --> 19:18.277
UM, NEXT QUESTION
IS GOING TO BE,

19:18.377 --> 19:20.039
"WHO IS MOST LIKELY
TO HAVE A RANDOM HOOKUP?"

19:20.139 --> 19:22.361
-JJ.

IT'S SPENCER, ALL RIGHT?

19:28.628 --> 19:30.811
HE JUST HOOKED UP WITH
THE GIRL FROM THE WEDDING STORE.

19:30.911 --> 19:32.653
I MEAN, DON'T GET
MORE RANDOM THAN THAT.

19:32.753 --> 19:34.735
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

19:34.835 --> 19:36.537
WHAT'S UP?

19:36.637 --> 19:39.180
DILLON: UH, I THINK IT MIGHT
BE TIME FOR A BREAK, YEAH?

19:39.280 --> 19:41.983
-YES. DOES SOMEONE WANT TO--
-YEAH. LET'S JUST GO, OK?

19:42.083 --> 19:44.286
-NO, NO, NO.
-JUST GO.

19:55.779 --> 19:57.361
WHAT WAS UP WITH PUTTING
ME ON BLAST LIKE THAT?

19:57.461 --> 19:58.762
BRO, MY BAD,
ALL RIGHT?

19:58.862 --> 20:00.204
MY COMPETITIVE
EDGE KICKED IN.

20:00.304 --> 20:01.285
IT WASN'T
ON PURPOSE,

20:01.385 --> 20:02.567
BUT YOU ARE
SINGLE, RIGHT?

20:02.667 --> 20:03.848
AND WE DON'T
WANT EVERYBODY

20:03.948 --> 20:05.050
UP IN MY
BUSINESS, COOP.

20:05.150 --> 20:06.371
NOW I GOT
TO FIGURE OUT

20:06.471 --> 20:08.053
HOW TO DO
DAMAGE CONTROL.

20:08.153 --> 20:10.015
THANK YOU.

20:10.115 --> 20:12.418

JUST SLIP OUT.

20:12.518 --> 20:14.740
IT HAPPENS.
HE'LL BE FINE.

20:14.840 --> 20:16.342
HOW ABOUT YOU,

20:16.442 --> 20:17.704
I MEAN, I SEEN YOU FACE
WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT YOU

20:17.804 --> 20:19.426
GOING VIRAL IN
THE RED-CARPET DRESS.

20:19.526 --> 20:21.148
YOU KNOW THAT WAS
A COMPLIMENT, RIGHT?

20:21.248 --> 20:23.751
I DO,
BUT THAT PERSON

20:23.851 --> 20:25.433
AT THAT GALA
WASN'T ME.

20:25.533 --> 20:27.114
IT LOOKS LIKE
ALL YOU TO ME,

20:27.214 --> 20:29.557
ESPECIALLY
IN THAT DRESS.

20:29.657 --> 20:32.400
UM...YEAH.

20:32.500 --> 20:34.082
I'M GONNA SEE YOU
LATER, OK?

20:34.182 --> 20:35.564
-PATIENCE, WAIT.
-NO. I'M TIRED.

20:35.664 --> 20:37.606
I'M TIRED, OK, AND
I HAVE TO SING TOMORROW,

20:37.706 --> 20:39.729
SO I JUST--

20:39.829 --> 20:42.212
YOU GUYS, I'M GONNA
CALL IT A NIGHT, OK?

20:42.312 --> 20:43.773
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'LL RIDE WITH YOU.

20:43.873 --> 20:46.516
THE PARTY AT OURS
IS PROBABLY OVER.

20:49.840 --> 20:51.302
[CAR HORN HONKS]

20:51.402 --> 20:53.264
CARTER: I DEFINITELY
MISS THE STUDENTS,

20:53.364 --> 20:55.667
BUT THIS GOVERNMENT
PAYCHECK AND BENEFITS,

20:55.767 --> 20:57.148
OOH, WHEE--

20:57.248 --> 20:58.590
MORE THAN

20:58.690 --> 21:00.592
AND YOU WOULDN'T
BELIEVE MY 401 k.

21:00.692 --> 21:03.235
YO, WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE EPIC BACHELOR PARTY?

21:03.335 --> 21:04.837
YO, WE SUPPOSED
TO BE GETTING LIT,

21:04.937 --> 21:06.839
NOT TALKING 401(k)s.

21:06.939 --> 21:08.481
LIKE, WE
AIN'T THAT OLD.

21:08.581 --> 21:10.844
OH, I HATE TO BREAK IT
TO YOU, BROTHER--

21:10.944 --> 21:12.966
MAYBE Y'ALL,
BUT NOT ME.

21:13.066 --> 21:14.648
I STILL GETS IT IN.

21:14.748 --> 21:17.091
I MEAN, MAYBE NOT
AS MUCH AS I USED TO,

21:17.191 --> 21:18.813
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE
OF MY WORK SCHEDULE,

21:18.913 --> 21:20.775
GETTING AMINA
BACK AND FORTH TO SCHOOL,

21:20.875 --> 21:23.698
AND, OF COURSE, HER
EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES...

21:23.798 --> 21:25.300
MM-HMM.

21:25.400 --> 21:26.982
PLUS I AIN'T REALLY
TRYING TO BE OUT

21:27.082 --> 21:29.765
ALL UP IN THEM STREETS,
ANYWAY.

21:31.567 --> 21:34.150
-HA HA!
-WELCOME TO THE CLUB.

21:34.250 --> 21:36.032
-CLINK.
-HA HA HA!

21:36.132 --> 21:38.155
BILLY: BEST TAKE CARE, BROTHER.

21:38.255 --> 21:40.557
WELL, THAT WAS
OUR LAST STOP.

21:40.657 --> 21:42.319
I DON'T WANT IT
TO BE OVER.

21:42.419 --> 21:44.121
I MIGHT HAVE
AN IDEA.

21:44.221 --> 21:46.805
REMEMBER THE TIME
WE PLAYED "TRUTH OR DARE"

21:46.905 --> 21:48.727
AND WE STOLE
A STREET SIGN?

21:48.827 --> 21:50.369
WAIT. I DO.

21:50.469 --> 21:53.492
IT WAS AT A SLEEPOVER
AT THE WASHINGTON TWINS',

21:53.592 --> 21:55.134
AND THEIR MOTHER
GOT UPSET WITH US

21:55.234 --> 21:57.497
BECAUSE WE USED ALL
OF HER PEROXIDE TO...

21:57.597 --> 21:59.179
-DYE OUR HAIR.
-DYE OUR HAIR.

21:59.279 --> 22:00.981
-HA HA HA!
-HA HA HA!

22:01.081 --> 22:02.823
LET'S JUST STEAL
THE STREET SIGN,

22:02.923 --> 22:04.745
ONE THAT MEANS
SOMETHING TO YOU.

22:04.845 --> 22:06.587
I PROMISE WE
WON'T GET CAUGHT.

22:06.687 --> 22:08.669
OK. FINE.
LET'S DO IT.

22:08.769 --> 22:10.191
REESE: HA HA!
LET'S DO IT.

22:10.291 --> 22:13.515
ISAAC, TAKE US
TO FIRST AND SLAUSON.

22:13.615 --> 22:15.117
-YOU GOT IT.
-SHOULD WE BE STOPPING THIS?

22:15.217 --> 22:16.518
OH, HELL NO.

22:16.618 --> 22:18.000
THIS IS
THE FIRST TIME

22:18.100 --> 22:19.281
THEY'VE ACTUALLY
ACTED LIKE SISTERS.

22:19.381 --> 22:20.763
LET'S
RIDE IT OUT.

22:20.863 --> 22:22.945
I KNOW, BUT ALL
MY HAIR FELL OUT.

22:28.952 --> 22:30.854
WHAT YOU DOING
OUT HERE?

22:30.954 --> 22:33.537
HEY, MAN,
I'M SORRY FOR PUTTING

22:33.637 --> 22:35.259
YOUR BUSINESS
OUT THERE LIKE THAT.

22:35.359 --> 22:37.061
IT'S ALL GOOD.

22:37.161 --> 22:40.265
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I AM SINGLE.

22:40.365 --> 22:43.388
SO'S LIV, AND FOR
WHATEVER REASON,

22:43.488 --> 22:45.391
IT'S REALLY HARD
GRASPING THAT.

22:45.491 --> 22:47.793
I WENT THROUGH THE SAME
THING WITH PATIENCE.

22:47.893 --> 22:49.355
I MEAN, JUST BECAUSE
YOU'RE NOT WITH SOMEONE

22:49.455 --> 22:51.638
DOESN'T MEAN YOU STOP
CARING ABOUT THEM.

22:51.738 --> 22:53.240
EVEN WHEN YOU'RE
TRYING TO MOVE ON,

22:53.340 --> 22:55.402
YOU STILL WANT TO
PROTECT THEIR FEELINGS,

22:55.502 --> 22:57.044
MM...

22:57.144 --> 22:59.246
BUT LIV DIDN'T DESERVE
TO FIND OUT LIKE THAT.

22:59.346 --> 23:01.289
YEAH, BUT
THAT'S ON ME.

23:01.389 --> 23:03.711
SHOULD'VE FOUND OUT A WAY
TO SAY SOMETHING SOONER.

23:05.033 --> 23:07.035
I MISS HER, COOP.

23:08.437 --> 23:10.439
I REALLY MISS HER.

23:16.366 --> 23:18.829
PREACH: SINCE LIGHTNING
DON'T STRIKE TWICE,

23:18.929 --> 23:21.752
HOW DID YOU KNOW
THAT GRACE WAS THE ONE?

23:21.852 --> 23:23.594
HAVE YOU MET HER?

23:23.694 --> 23:25.836
SHE'S SMART.
SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.

23:25.936 --> 23:27.999
BROTHER,
I GOT THIS.

23:28.099 --> 23:29.400
OH, I THOUGHT HE
WAS TALKING TO ME.

23:29.500 --> 23:31.443
OH, YOU'RE TALKING--
NO. YEAH. TELL HIM.

23:31.543 --> 23:32.965
TELL-- YEAH.

23:33.065 --> 23:34.166
[CHUCKLES]

23:34.266 --> 23:36.448
WHEN MY WIFE PASSED,
I DIDN'T THINK

23:36.548 --> 23:38.451
I'D LOVE ANYONE
LIKE THAT AGAIN.

23:38.551 --> 23:40.813
I JUST DIDN'T THINK
IT WAS POSSIBLE,

23:40.913 --> 23:43.617
AND THEN GORGEOUS GRACE
ENTERED MY LIFE,

23:43.717 --> 23:45.939
AND SHE WAS
A FORCE OF NATURE.

23:46.039 --> 23:48.182
SHE JUST HAD THIS WAY
OF MAKING YOU FEEL

23:48.282 --> 23:50.945
LIKE YOU WERE JUST CAPABLE
OF DOING ANYTHING.

23:51.045 --> 23:53.307
IN GRACE, ALL THE FEELINGS
THAT I THOUGHT WERE DEAD

23:53.407 --> 23:55.830
STARTED TO COME
ALIVE AGAIN

23:55.930 --> 23:58.954
LIKE SHE JUST
