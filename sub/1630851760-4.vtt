WEBVTT

00:57.348 --> 00:58.308
Hey, Ms. Dentist.

01:02.145 --> 01:03.354
Hey, Ms. Dentist.

01:06.191 --> 01:07.484
Hey, Ms. Dentist.

01:10.236 --> 01:11.446
Ms. Dentist!

01:40.141 --> 01:41.184
Mi-seon.

01:44.354 --> 01:45.230
Mi-seon!

01:46.648 --> 01:48.608
-Did you sleep in again?
-Yes.

01:48.691 --> 01:50.735
-I'll get going first.
-Wait for me.

01:50.819 --> 01:53.613
-No way. I'll be late.
-Give me three minutes.

02:12.173 --> 02:13.049
Hey there.

02:19.222 --> 02:21.724
<i>You can actually form a bond with them.</i>

02:21.808 --> 02:23.184
<i>And when you do,</i>

02:23.268 --> 02:27.272
<i>they lay down their spines
so you can pet them.</i>

02:29.065 --> 02:29.899
Ouch!

02:30.567 --> 02:33.069
Damn prickly, aren't you?

02:34.112 --> 02:35.488
<i>You guys are similar.</i>

02:35.572 --> 02:37.198
<i>The hedgehog is just like you.</i>

02:37.699 --> 02:40.160
You're both spiky.

02:40.743 --> 02:42.245
No, we're not similar.

02:45.373 --> 02:48.376
Mi-seon, three minutes are up.
I'm leaving!

02:48.459 --> 02:49.502
Let's go.

02:51.880 --> 02:53.673
Did you replace your face or something?

02:57.677 --> 02:59.679
EPISODE 4

03:02.140 --> 03:03.850
Why isn't he around today?

03:03.933 --> 03:04.934
What do you mean?

03:05.476 --> 03:06.311
It's nothing.

03:09.647 --> 03:11.357
What do you want for lunch?

03:11.441 --> 03:12.650
How about <i>jjajangmyeon</i>?

03:13.818 --> 03:16.779
Are you already thinking about lunch
on the way to work?

03:17.864 --> 03:18.990
That I approve of.

03:21.075 --> 03:22.785
<i>Jjajangmyeon</i>?

03:23.786 --> 03:25.538
GONGJIN KOREAN-CHINESE RESTAURANT

03:26.039 --> 03:28.750
What's with the long face since before?

03:29.709 --> 03:30.627
What do you mean?

03:30.710 --> 03:32.921
You've been like that
since our food got here.

03:33.004 --> 03:34.797
This is what you wanted for lunch.

03:34.881 --> 03:36.341
Did you get another craving?

03:36.424 --> 03:40.178
I guess the warmer weather
made me crave <i>naengmyeon</i>.

03:40.261 --> 03:41.930
Then we'll have that for dinner.

03:42.013 --> 03:43.932
Now, take these out.

03:44.766 --> 03:45.600
Right.

03:45.683 --> 03:47.185
Miss?

03:48.603 --> 03:50.146
I think the heat got to you.

03:56.986 --> 03:59.280
He's always around
when you least expect it,

03:59.364 --> 04:00.782
so where is he today?

04:05.453 --> 04:08.790
Hye-jin, isn't this that guy?

04:09.457 --> 04:11.376
Hey, it's Seong-hyeon.

04:11.459 --> 04:12.710
RISING STAR TV PRODUCER
JI SEONG-HYEON

04:12.794 --> 04:14.254
No wonder.

04:14.337 --> 04:17.548
You rarely watch TV,
but you tuned in to his shows.

04:17.632 --> 04:21.052
We went to school together,
so I hoped he'd catch a big break.

04:21.761 --> 04:23.930
As if. I'm no fool, you know.

04:24.013 --> 04:25.723
You have a crush on this guy.

04:25.807 --> 04:27.934
No, I don't!

04:28.017 --> 04:30.186
A man and woman can be just friends.

04:31.229 --> 04:32.438
You're so old-fashioned.

04:33.815 --> 04:37.068
When it's not meant to be, it just isn't.

04:37.151 --> 04:40.238
Why does he have to be
Lee Gang-uk's friend of all people?

04:43.491 --> 04:45.201
Why do you have on all that makeup?

04:46.536 --> 04:47.787
Who are you waiting for?

04:48.454 --> 04:49.747
Choi Eun-cheol?

04:49.831 --> 04:50.957
He's not coming today.

04:52.500 --> 04:54.168
-Welcome.
-Hello.

04:54.252 --> 04:55.420
Hello and welcome.

04:55.503 --> 04:58.965
It's my first time here, so I didn't
make an appointment. Is that all right?

04:59.048 --> 05:00.383
-Sure.
-Of course.

05:00.466 --> 05:02.677
-Please fill in this form.
-Right.

05:02.760 --> 05:04.595
-I'll see you in the exam room.
-Okay.

05:08.182 --> 05:10.643
Judging by the level of your pain,

05:10.727 --> 05:15.064
I'm guessing that your tooth decayed
under the old crown.

05:15.148 --> 05:19.110
It's tough to see
with just an X-ray though,

05:19.193 --> 05:21.029
so I'll have to lift it up to be sure.

05:21.112 --> 05:22.947
Once I verify the decay,

05:23.031 --> 05:25.575
we'll treat the nerve damage
or decide on an implant.

05:26.326 --> 05:29.412
However, there's a price gap
between the two options--

05:29.495 --> 05:32.582
That's no problem.
I trust your judgment, doctor.

05:32.665 --> 05:35.126
Thank you. I'll do my best then.

05:35.710 --> 05:40.256
I hear a lot of patients throw a fit
regarding the cost of dental procedures.

05:40.798 --> 05:44.343
Many have been installing cameras
inside the exam room.

05:44.427 --> 05:46.095
The thing is

05:46.179 --> 05:49.432
in order to install cameras,
I need the patients' consent,

05:49.515 --> 05:51.476
so I haven't gotten around to that yet.

05:51.559 --> 05:52.393
I see.

05:53.352 --> 05:55.146
Doctor, you're quite the beauty.

05:56.272 --> 05:57.273
Thank you.

05:57.774 --> 06:00.568
But I prefer to hear
that I'm a good doctor.

06:00.651 --> 06:02.820
I hope I didn't cross any lines just now.

06:02.904 --> 06:04.280
No, it's fine.

06:04.363 --> 06:07.408
-Let me take a look then.
-Sure.

06:08.242 --> 06:09.577
Did it hurt a lot?

06:11.871 --> 06:13.831
Here is your card and receipt.

06:13.915 --> 06:15.291
Thank you.

06:17.460 --> 06:19.962
-I'll see you tomorrow.
-Have a nice day.

06:24.592 --> 06:26.594
TREATMENT ROOM

06:27.303 --> 06:29.263
I love patients who are polite.

06:30.306 --> 06:32.809
He'll trust my judgment
regardless of the cost.

06:32.892 --> 06:36.187
He must be loaded.
Everything he wore was a designer label.

06:36.270 --> 06:41.317
Really? Does being financially well-off
give you that level of politeness?

06:42.318 --> 06:44.070
Isn't that a little sad though?

06:44.153 --> 06:47.240
It's all the more reason
to earn lots of money.

06:49.575 --> 06:50.618
All right.

06:54.455 --> 06:56.707
You're buying apples? What's the occasion?

06:57.291 --> 06:59.168
You only buy fruits that are in season.

06:59.252 --> 07:01.504
It's my mom's death anniversary tomorrow.

07:03.131 --> 07:04.924
I'm sorry I forgot.

07:05.007 --> 07:07.844
How can you remember it
when you're busy making a living?

07:08.886 --> 07:10.763
-I'll take these.
-Sure.

07:17.311 --> 07:19.313
You're definitely showing now.

07:19.397 --> 07:22.233
It's going to get heavier.
It'll get harder and harder.

07:22.316 --> 07:23.609
Not like it's my first time.

07:23.693 --> 07:25.403
It's still just as hard.

07:25.486 --> 07:29.407
I guess. Maybe it's because
I'm aware of the pain,

07:29.490 --> 07:31.242
but I already have dreams about it.

07:32.243 --> 07:35.121
Is Geum-cheol upset
that your second child is a daughter too?

07:35.204 --> 07:38.958
Of course not. He's thrilled
to finally raise a proper girl.

07:39.542 --> 07:41.586
He's even been practicing braiding hair.

07:43.004 --> 07:45.423
Come to think of it,
Bo-ra never had long hair.

07:45.506 --> 07:49.427
Exactly. She's not like
your usual young girls.

07:49.510 --> 07:53.556
When other girls sing "Let It Go"
in Elsa dresses,

07:53.639 --> 07:56.100
she dances like a boy
in a taekwondo uniform.

07:56.851 --> 07:59.187
Wait and see. Kids like that make it big.

07:59.270 --> 08:00.813
I really hope so.

08:03.608 --> 08:06.027
-Funny, isn't it?
-It's embarrassing.

08:06.777 --> 08:09.071
What? Get over here!

08:11.699 --> 08:14.368
Bo-ra, I told you not to do that again!

08:14.452 --> 08:16.996
Bo-ra will knock out
all of I-jun's baby teeth for him.

08:17.079 --> 08:18.289
-Stop it!
-Hey!

08:21.167 --> 08:22.335
I'm sorry.

08:25.338 --> 08:27.965
-Would this be enough?
-My gosh.

08:28.049 --> 08:29.759
YOON DENTAL CLINIC
CHUNG-HO SCUBA DIVING

08:29.842 --> 08:31.552
Goodness, where are you two off to?

08:31.636 --> 08:33.221
-Hello.
-Hi.

08:33.804 --> 08:35.598
We're on our way home.

08:35.681 --> 08:38.184
I see. Then I guess I came right on time.

08:38.267 --> 08:41.896
If you're free today,
I was hoping to invite you somewhere.

08:41.979 --> 08:42.980
Where?

08:43.689 --> 08:46.859
the shopkeepers' meeting
that is the heart of Gongjin's economy.

08:46.943 --> 08:48.236
I see.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.614
All the business owners here are members.

08:52.281 --> 08:55.159
If you wish to run a business here,
you should joinâ€¦

08:55.243 --> 08:58.412
Not that your practice
is a store like ours.

08:59.121 --> 09:03.167
Anyway, in order to raise profits,
you should join as a member.

09:03.251 --> 09:05.836
We'd love to be at the meeting today,

09:05.920 --> 09:07.547
but I'm afraid we have other plans.

09:07.630 --> 09:09.966
-Right.
-I see. That's too bad then.

09:10.049 --> 09:11.884
I'd love to change the date for you,

09:11.968 --> 09:15.721
but our treasurer Chief Hong
only has today to spare.

09:16.222 --> 09:18.641
-The treasurer?
-Yes, Chief Hong is the treasurer

09:18.724 --> 09:20.184
and I'm the chairwoman.

09:20.268 --> 09:22.603
-I'll be there.
-Really?

09:22.687 --> 09:26.649
Yes, I'll go to show my support
as a fellow business owner

09:26.732 --> 09:29.986
and to do what I can
to help the community thrive.

09:31.112 --> 09:35.116
I'm so glad you think that way!
Let's get going then.

09:35.199 --> 09:36.742
-Hold on.
-Goodness.

09:36.826 --> 09:39.036
I have somewhere else to be.

09:39.120 --> 09:42.665
I guess we only need the owner to attend.
The employee can go about her day.

09:42.748 --> 09:45.543
Dr. Yoon, shall we? My gosh, Dr. Yoon!

09:45.626 --> 09:48.296
-That hurts.
-Did it? Well, I'll try to refrain myself.

09:48.379 --> 09:49.797
Why don't I carry this for you?

09:49.880 --> 09:51.173
What's with her?

09:51.257 --> 09:52.883
<i>For our shopkeepers' meeting!</i>

09:52.967 --> 09:54.093
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

09:54.176 --> 09:56.095
-Dr. Yoon, cheers.
-Cheers!

09:56.178 --> 09:57.388
This is nice.

10:01.058 --> 10:02.310
This hit the spot.

10:02.810 --> 10:07.773
As you know, we have
too many officials here in Gongjin.

10:07.857 --> 10:11.569
Village chief, zone chief, area chief.

10:11.652 --> 10:13.571
However, I believe

10:13.654 --> 10:16.949
that my role as
the shopkeepers' meeting's chairwoman

10:17.033 --> 10:20.369
is the most important.

10:20.453 --> 10:23.748
Of course.
You're the Minister of Economy in Gongjin.

10:23.831 --> 10:25.708
The Minister of Strategy and Finance.

10:25.791 --> 10:27.084
-Sorry?
-What was that?

10:27.168 --> 10:28.210
It's nothing.

10:28.294 --> 10:30.796
-Right.
-Anyway, Dr. Yoon,

10:30.880 --> 10:33.424
since it's your first time here,

10:33.507 --> 10:36.594
could you say a few words
regarding this meeting?

10:36.677 --> 10:38.304
-Me?
-Yes.

10:38.888 --> 10:42.183
-Like what?
-Goodness. It's embarrassing to say this,

10:42.266 --> 10:45.061
but the meeting has been in a rut lately.

10:45.144 --> 10:47.438
Not many attend the meetings anymore.

10:47.521 --> 10:49.774
So I was hoping to know

10:49.857 --> 10:53.778
if you had any ideas on how to make it
lively again since you're smart and all.

10:54.445 --> 10:56.364
It's my first day,

10:56.447 --> 10:58.115
so I don't know what to say--

10:58.199 --> 11:00.451
Just say whatever comes to mind.

11:00.534 --> 11:01.744
Yes, no pressure.

11:01.827 --> 11:06.207
Then how about we make a member directory
that include contact numbers?

11:06.916 --> 11:11.253
You know, when someone
who's attended it regularly stops coming,

11:11.337 --> 11:15.091
if we have a contact list, we can have

11:15.675 --> 11:16.967
better communication--

11:17.051 --> 11:20.054
Here's our member directory. Unbelievable.

11:20.137 --> 11:22.348
-Hey.
-Did you really think we didn't have one?

11:22.431 --> 11:25.101
Even grade school students
would have better ideas.

11:25.184 --> 11:26.977
That's because I was put on the spot.

11:27.061 --> 11:29.522
Chief Hong, why are you so late?

11:29.605 --> 11:31.607
It's my day off, you see.

11:32.149 --> 11:32.983
Gosh.

11:33.067 --> 11:34.819
I wasn't aware of the time.

11:34.902 --> 11:36.278
Do you have days off?

11:36.362 --> 11:38.155
Yes, whenever I feel like it.

11:38.239 --> 11:41.450
-You sure have it easy.
-Live like me if you're jealous.

11:41.534 --> 11:42.368
Forget it.

11:43.035 --> 11:47.164
Are you the treasurer
of the shopkeepers' meeting?

11:47.248 --> 11:50.418
-Yes.
-How so? You don't even own a business.

11:50.501 --> 11:52.711
I'm a freelancer hired by Ms. Cho.

11:53.796 --> 11:55.047
I see.

11:55.131 --> 11:57.007
Who knew this could be a freelancing job?

11:57.091 --> 12:00.928
Hwa-jeong still puts down
Yeong-guk's number as hers.

12:01.011 --> 12:02.513
This isn't Hollywood, you know.

12:02.596 --> 12:05.349
As if their divorce made
things awkward enough.

12:05.933 --> 12:08.310
One's a village chief
while the other's a zone chief.

12:08.394 --> 12:09.979
It's super awkward.

12:13.357 --> 12:17.611
We were given garbage bags
to hand out to the elderly.

12:18.863 --> 12:20.489
I'll come by soon to collect them.

12:20.573 --> 12:21.782
Sure.

12:21.866 --> 12:23.576
We have the finalized list

12:23.659 --> 12:26.537
of those who'll be cooking
at the Lighthouse Song Festival.

12:26.620 --> 12:29.790
I see. Bring it over
when you come for the garbage bags.

12:31.625 --> 12:33.586
That reminds me. Tomorrowâ€¦

12:35.337 --> 12:39.258
I hear that the zone chief committee
will be cleaning the streets tomorrow.

12:39.341 --> 12:42.803
Just know that it gets especially dirty
behind the marketplace.

12:42.887 --> 12:44.847
The smell is unbearable.

12:44.930 --> 12:46.390
I'll keep it in mind.

12:51.061 --> 12:52.438
Have you had dinner?

12:54.940 --> 12:58.527
No matter how hard I try,
I can't seem to understand them.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.779
-What do you mean?
-How should I put it?

13:00.863 --> 13:04.992
You need to be really cold-hearted
to get a divorce. Don't you agree?

13:05.075 --> 13:08.287
-That's an old-fashioned view.
-What?

13:08.370 --> 13:11.165
There's nothing wrong with divorcing.

13:11.248 --> 13:14.293
Just like marriage,
it's one of the life choices we make.

13:14.376 --> 13:15.836
Yes, Ms. Dentist is right.

13:15.920 --> 13:17.296
Yes, of course.

13:17.379 --> 13:19.673
You're right. I get that too,

13:19.757 --> 13:22.009
but there didn't seem
to be any reason for it.

13:22.092 --> 13:25.804
They were fine together then got a divorce
all of a sudden. You all know that.

13:25.888 --> 13:28.599
-Right.
-I doubt anyone was in the wrong.

13:28.682 --> 13:31.727
-You can't be so sure about that.
-Really?

13:31.810 --> 13:34.939
But if something big had happened,
one would've moved away.

13:35.022 --> 13:37.358
-Of course.
-Right?

13:37.441 --> 13:38.984
Can we join you?

13:39.068 --> 13:40.402
-You're here.
-Hey!

13:40.486 --> 13:42.613
Please have a seat.
Chief Chang is here too.

13:42.696 --> 13:45.032
We both haven't had dinner yet, soâ€¦

13:45.115 --> 13:47.076
-Good evening.
-Dr. Yoon, you're here too.

13:47.159 --> 13:50.871
-You won't even offer me a seat?
-Come sit. That's your seat.

13:50.955 --> 13:54.708
The talk must've been so fun.
I could hear your voice from outside.

13:55.209 --> 13:56.961
No, it wasn't that fun.

13:57.920 --> 14:00.381
Since you're here,
you should order something.

14:00.464 --> 14:02.591
Chun-jae, can we get the menu?

14:02.675 --> 14:03.968
The menu, please!

14:04.051 --> 14:05.177
Over here.

14:05.261 --> 14:07.680
Couldn't you come and fetch it yourself?

14:07.763 --> 14:10.057
Right here. Leave it there.

14:10.140 --> 14:12.434
Hey, guys. Order whatever you want.

14:12.518 --> 14:13.644
What's with your voice?

14:13.727 --> 14:14.895
I have laryngitis.

14:14.979 --> 14:16.814
-What?
-Laryngitis.

14:17.439 --> 14:19.066
All the singing--

14:19.149 --> 14:22.444
In that case, it's better not to talk.

14:22.528 --> 14:23.612
Then I should shut up.

14:23.696 --> 14:26.156
She's right. You're a singer,
so you should be careful.

14:26.240 --> 14:28.951
Fine. Place your orders then.
Just yell it out.

14:29.034 --> 14:30.536
-Got it.
-Don't talk too much.

14:30.619 --> 14:34.748
Why would his throat give in
when his songs don't have any high notes?

14:36.208 --> 14:37.376
<i>-Right?
-Come on!</i>

14:37.459 --> 14:40.421
-Exactly.
-That's hilarious!

14:40.504 --> 14:43.048
-You're wrong.
-If you think about it,

14:43.132 --> 14:44.675
-that's how it is.
-No way.

14:44.758 --> 14:46.176
I'm curious though.

14:46.260 --> 14:48.387
Why do you two hang out together so often?

14:48.470 --> 14:51.181
-Don't.
-Must you put it like that?

14:51.265 --> 14:52.349
I smacked him for you.

14:52.433 --> 14:55.269
-I'm just curious, that's all.
-Unbelievable.

14:57.229 --> 15:00.941
Damn. Why did I agree to come here?
What was I thinking?

15:02.735 --> 15:04.153
They talk too much.

15:08.741 --> 15:09.950
Hi.

15:22.755 --> 15:24.632
Kids these days are terrifying.

15:26.133 --> 15:27.885
What has the world come to?

15:36.560 --> 15:38.270
They're so gorgeous.

15:44.109 --> 15:45.569
You must be a Hacker.

15:47.321 --> 15:49.698
Isn't Hacker the name of DOS' fandom?

15:49.782 --> 15:50.866
You're a Hacker?

15:52.409 --> 15:54.286
No, not exactly.

15:55.579 --> 15:58.165
But JUNE, one of the membersâ€¦

15:58.874 --> 15:59.833
Don't touch it.

15:59.917 --> 16:02.378
I treated him two years ago.

16:03.045 --> 16:03.963
Stop lying.

16:04.046 --> 16:07.132
Why would I lie about something like that?
I really did.

16:07.216 --> 16:11.637
Look here, old lady. Many people lie
about knowing the members of DOS.

16:11.720 --> 16:13.514
-Unbelievable.
-But it's true.

16:13.597 --> 16:16.350
Why would I lie about something like that?

16:16.433 --> 16:17.935
Do you have proof?

16:18.018 --> 16:20.145
-Do you?
-Proof?

16:20.813 --> 16:23.983
Look at you all flustered.
I knew it was a lie.

16:24.066 --> 16:26.485
I don't remember it clearly,

16:27.152 --> 16:29.071
but I took a photo with him.

16:29.154 --> 16:33.117
People always say they don't remember
when put on the spot. Right, JUNE?

16:33.200 --> 16:34.368
She drives me nuts.

16:39.748 --> 16:42.251
What? Where'd he run off to now?

16:42.334 --> 16:44.378
-The popcorn tastes the best.
-Give me some.

16:44.461 --> 16:46.547
-Better than all these.
-Where are the freebies?

16:46.630 --> 16:48.590
-Yes, where's the free food?
-You're right.

16:48.674 --> 16:49.675
Get out--

16:50.509 --> 16:52.052
He's faking the pain again.

16:52.136 --> 16:53.971
I told you I'd take care of it.

16:54.054 --> 16:55.681
-Give us freebies!
-You're so slow.

16:55.764 --> 16:57.433
Let's gather at my place next time.

16:57.516 --> 16:59.601
-Give us <i>tangsuyuk</i> then.
-Yes, <i>tangsuyuk</i>.

16:59.685 --> 17:01.895
-<i>Tangsuyuk</i> and--
-And free grilled dumplings.

17:01.979 --> 17:04.273
-But don't grill them too much.
<i>-I want to go home.</i>

17:04.356 --> 17:07.317
But they're grilled dumplings.
It's not like I can steam them.

17:07.401 --> 17:09.820
-Do you have boiled dumplings?
-Don't be unreasonable.

17:09.903 --> 17:11.363
Unbelievable.

17:11.447 --> 17:13.657
They seem to have
such a good relationship.

17:13.741 --> 17:15.534
-Dr. Yoon must be drunk.
-What?

17:16.368 --> 17:17.244
You're right.

17:17.327 --> 17:19.121
But she didn't drink a lot.

17:19.204 --> 17:20.873
Shouldn't she go home?

17:20.956 --> 17:24.960
<i>Like always, my killer move works.
"Pretending to be drunk."</i>

17:25.044 --> 17:27.254
-Guys.
-What is it?

17:27.921 --> 17:29.882
Hold on. Is Chief Hong singing today?

17:29.965 --> 17:32.134
He must be filling in for Chun-jae.

17:32.718 --> 17:35.304
<i>Chief Hong will sing?</i>

17:45.564 --> 17:49.276
<i>Without anyone knowing</i>

17:49.359 --> 17:53.197
<i>I hung around and cried</i>

17:53.280 --> 18:00.037
<i>Past moments sank deep into my heart</i>

18:00.746 --> 18:03.582
<i>Under the empty sky</i>

18:04.500 --> 18:07.836
<i>As the lights switch on</i>

18:08.462 --> 18:15.052
<i>I carefully call out my old lover's name</i>

18:15.844 --> 18:19.014
<i>Cold wind blows</i>

18:19.765 --> 18:22.976
<i>And I adjust my collar</i>

18:23.685 --> 18:30.651
<i>In regret and anger
Tears drop from my eyes</i>

18:31.235 --> 18:34.238
<i>I once believed</i>

18:34.905 --> 18:38.450
<i>No one could hurt me</i>

18:39.159 --> 18:45.916
<i>But was my past self all a lie?</i>

18:46.708 --> 18:52.631
<i>What I long for</i>

18:52.714 --> 18:59.596
<i>I will keep as is inside my heart</i>

19:06.270 --> 19:08.647
My wife keeps calling me,
so I should go now.

19:08.730 --> 19:10.107
-Sure.
-Right.

19:10.190 --> 19:11.483
I'm too tired

19:11.567 --> 19:13.277
-to stay any longer.
-Sure thing.

19:13.360 --> 19:15.445
<i>Why won't they wake me
and tell me to go home?</i>

19:15.529 --> 19:16.488
-Let's go.
-Bye!

19:16.572 --> 19:18.282
What about Dr. Yoon?

19:18.365 --> 19:20.242
I'll manage her, so go home.

19:20.325 --> 19:21.910
-Will you?
-Go ahead.

19:21.994 --> 19:23.078
-Shall we?
-Let's go.

19:23.162 --> 19:24.329
-Go on.
-Thanks for this.

19:24.413 --> 19:25.414
Bye.

19:25.497 --> 19:26.874
-We're going.
-Bye.

19:26.957 --> 19:29.042
-Chun-jae, we're leaving.
-Bye!

19:30.544 --> 19:33.422
<i>What do I do? Should I just get up?</i>

19:39.094 --> 19:40.179
One, two, three.

19:43.223 --> 19:44.808
What do I do?

19:46.226 --> 19:47.352
One, two, three.

19:48.312 --> 19:49.646
<i>What is he doing?</i>

19:56.737 --> 19:57.863
Darn it.

20:02.117 --> 20:03.535
Chun-jae, I'm off!

20:14.630 --> 20:16.089
<i>Wait. My shoe!</i>

20:18.550 --> 20:20.802
<i>Hey, my shoe!</i>

20:20.886 --> 20:23.597
<i>Don't leave it behind. Unbelievable!</i>

20:26.225 --> 20:27.851
Drop the act and hop off.

20:28.977 --> 20:30.646
I know you're not asleep.

20:41.657 --> 20:43.325
Unbelievable.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.541
My body aches all over.

20:51.625 --> 20:54.878
Thanks to your lie, I carried something
as heavy as a sack of rice.

20:56.505 --> 20:58.048
How heavy is a sack of rice?

20:58.131 --> 20:59.466
Forget it if you don't know.

20:59.549 --> 21:01.760
Why did you even pretend to sleep?

21:02.302 --> 21:04.012
Because I wanted to hurry home.

21:04.096 --> 21:05.889
We live in a society.

21:05.973 --> 21:08.267
You can't hate being around people.

21:08.850 --> 21:10.102
I bet you have no friends.

21:11.228 --> 21:14.815
-You're wrong. I have tons.
-Name three in five seconds then.

21:14.898 --> 21:17.651
-Five, four, three, two,
-Pyo Mi-seon, Mi-seon.

21:17.734 --> 21:18.944
-one.
-and Pyo Mi-seon.

21:19.027 --> 21:20.737
So one Mi-seon and two Pyo Mi-seons.

21:21.405 --> 21:23.699
-Are they different people?
-What's it to you

21:23.782 --> 21:25.117
if I have friends or not?

21:25.200 --> 21:26.618
What a jerk.

21:34.668 --> 21:36.128
She really likes those shoes.

21:42.968 --> 21:44.344
ONE SACK OF RICE WEIGHT

21:44.428 --> 21:47.597
Eighty kilograms? That jerk.

21:48.265 --> 21:49.391
Unbelievable.

21:51.268 --> 21:53.812
That's odd. Did someone move in?

21:55.814 --> 21:57.107
What a jerk.

22:07.326 --> 22:08.535
Why are you following me?

22:08.618 --> 22:11.663
What are you talking about?
I'm only on my way home.

22:11.747 --> 22:13.206
Then take another route.

22:13.290 --> 22:15.917
Why should I take the long way home?

22:16.001 --> 22:17.836
Move out, why don't you?

22:17.919 --> 22:20.630
Moving is so much work.
You want me to do it again?

22:20.714 --> 22:23.759
Taking your things after the divorce
doesn't qualify as moving.

22:23.842 --> 22:26.720
Yes, it does. A change of residence
is called moving.

22:26.803 --> 22:28.930
Whatever. Forget it. Just take this.

22:30.390 --> 22:31.391
What is it?

22:31.475 --> 22:33.518
Can't you tell? It's the kimchi container.

22:37.481 --> 22:38.648
I enjoyed it.

22:42.444 --> 22:44.154
Did you scrub it clean?

22:45.906 --> 22:47.282
It's hard to remove the smell.

23:25.612 --> 23:26.613
Gosh.

23:32.619 --> 23:33.912
Let me see.

23:36.164 --> 23:37.916
It should be here.

23:42.379 --> 23:45.715
Found it. Just wait to see this, brat.

25:43.583 --> 25:44.834
Where's the kid?

25:45.418 --> 25:46.962
The one who talks back to adults.

25:47.045 --> 25:49.130
Ju-ri? She's at school, of course.

25:49.714 --> 25:52.217
Right. I should come back later then.

25:52.300 --> 25:53.343
What about coffee?

25:56.096 --> 25:58.390
I do need some caffeine.

25:58.932 --> 26:01.101
But I'm a little busy,
so could it be delivered?

26:01.184 --> 26:02.102
Of course.

26:02.602 --> 26:07.816
Then one Americano and one latte, please.
With lots of ice and syrup.

26:07.899 --> 26:09.109
It'll cost 2,000 won more.

26:10.610 --> 26:11.611
You cheapskate.

26:11.695 --> 26:13.738
How can you charge me
when you're right by?

26:13.822 --> 26:15.991
I get paid whenever I move.

26:16.074 --> 26:17.993
-Manual labor--
-Whatever.

26:18.076 --> 26:19.995
-Cancel my order.
-Jeez.

26:27.794 --> 26:29.504
<i>You did great today.</i>

26:30.171 --> 26:31.006
I bet it hurt.

26:31.089 --> 26:35.427
How could it not when my gums were slit?

26:35.510 --> 26:37.929
It doesn't stop me
from living my life though.

26:38.972 --> 26:40.849
We'll check it again in two weeks.

26:40.932 --> 26:46.271
Sure. You're my dentist,
so I do as you say.

26:48.857 --> 26:51.276
-Hello.
-Hi.

26:51.359 --> 26:53.862
-Get home safely then.
-Have a good day.

26:54.529 --> 26:57.324
-So how was your temporary crown?
-It wasn't bad.

26:57.407 --> 26:59.951
-Let me take you inside then.
-Sure.

27:03.872 --> 27:08.251
Hold on a second.
Where have I seen him before?

27:11.004 --> 27:12.839
The needle stung, didn't it?

27:13.798 --> 27:15.175
My gums are a bit stiff.

27:16.134 --> 27:19.804
Scaling will be done while your gums
go numb, and the treatment will follow.

27:20.513 --> 27:22.098
-Ms. Pyo?
-Sure.

27:37.364 --> 27:40.617
Hey. Here's the coffee you ordered.

27:41.284 --> 27:44.287
But I canceled my order.
Are you forcing this coffee on me?

27:44.371 --> 27:47.290
It wouldn't be right
to ignore the order that came in.

27:48.708 --> 27:50.377
What are you waiting for? Pay up.

27:54.964 --> 27:56.966
"How to sterilize."

27:57.050 --> 27:59.135
I guess that's important these days.

28:00.595 --> 28:02.180
Here you go.

28:02.263 --> 28:04.849
With the loyal customer discount,

28:04.933 --> 28:09.312
the Americano is 3,000 won
and the latte is 3,500 won. So 3,000 won

28:11.231 --> 28:12.399
andâ€¦

28:13.233 --> 28:14.442
here's 500 won.

28:16.236 --> 28:19.239
That's a lot of change.
I thought there was a delivery fee.

28:19.322 --> 28:22.700
It's fine. I stopped by since no one
was at the cafe. I'll get going then.

28:25.620 --> 28:28.289
What? That's not like him at all.

28:29.666 --> 28:30.542
Lucky us.

28:36.548 --> 28:37.841
<i>Eodongyukseo</i>.

28:38.967 --> 28:42.178
Fish sits in the east
and meat sits in the west.

28:44.055 --> 28:45.515
<i>Hongdongbaekseo</i>.

28:46.349 --> 28:50.103
Red fruit sits in the east
and white fruit sits in the west.

28:53.523 --> 28:54.566
Mom.

28:55.775 --> 28:58.445
How can you serve that
at a memorial service?

28:58.528 --> 29:01.197
My mom loved roll cakes, you see.

29:03.199 --> 29:05.452
I know you're a stickler for the rules,

29:05.535 --> 29:09.080
but can I serve what she loved
since the service is for her?

29:28.141 --> 29:29.350
Let's bow.

29:52.957 --> 29:56.044
Uncle Du-sik, can you make me
a cup of vanilla latte?

29:56.127 --> 29:57.629
-No.
-I'll pay.

29:57.712 --> 30:00.006
Don't be cheeky.
I don't sell coffee to kids.

30:00.089 --> 30:01.633
We all drink coffee these days.

30:01.716 --> 30:04.052
-Not you though.
-Why not?

30:04.135 --> 30:05.804
The recommended amount of caffeine

30:05.887 --> 30:07.889
is 2.5mg per 1kg of body weight
for minors.

30:07.972 --> 30:09.182
By the looks of it,

30:09.265 --> 30:11.684
-you weigh around 45kg.
-What?

30:11.768 --> 30:14.020
Your caffeine intake
should only be 112.5mg,

30:14.103 --> 30:16.981
but you had chocolate
that contained caffeine earlier.

30:17.065 --> 30:18.399
You had two pieces, so 30mg.

30:18.483 --> 30:21.069
Vanilla latte has around 100mg,

30:21.778 --> 30:25.657
so drinking that means you'll have
more caffeine than recommended.

30:25.740 --> 30:26.908
That's so unfair.

30:26.991 --> 30:29.369
-Take this.
-No, you can have it.

30:29.452 --> 30:30.578
What if I have three?

30:30.662 --> 30:31.788
That's 15 plus 15 plus 15mg.

30:33.289 --> 30:35.875
Ms. Dentist, I'd rather
not see you three times a day.

30:35.959 --> 30:38.419
Likewise, so don't talk to me.

30:38.503 --> 30:40.296
I'm here to see someone else.

30:43.591 --> 30:45.176
I brought you proof.

30:45.260 --> 30:46.636
Proof?

30:47.762 --> 30:49.347
My gosh. No way!

30:50.431 --> 30:52.851
Did you really meet him?
I thought you were lying!

30:52.934 --> 30:54.060
Look how handsome he is.

30:54.143 --> 30:55.186
-Wait--
-No way!

30:55.270 --> 30:57.313
-I want to be a dentist too!
-What's that?

30:57.397 --> 31:00.942
-What is it? God, you're so loud.
-He's super handsome!

31:01.025 --> 31:03.361
-Look at it over there then.
-He's so handsome!

31:03.444 --> 31:04.821
-Fine, I get it.
-So handsome!

31:04.904 --> 31:07.073
I'm speechless by his beauty.

31:07.824 --> 31:11.286
What does he look like in person?
Is he handsome? Of course he is.

31:11.369 --> 31:12.954
What was he like?

31:13.872 --> 31:16.624
He's handsome, much more so in person.

31:16.708 --> 31:18.459
I'm so jealous.

31:18.543 --> 31:20.837
Did JUNE handle the pain well?

31:21.421 --> 31:24.799
According to his vlog,
dental procedures scare him. Poor JUNE.

31:24.883 --> 31:28.469
I'm afraid I can't disclose
a patient's personal information.

31:28.553 --> 31:32.348
Is that so? Then what should I ask?

31:32.432 --> 31:34.601
Did he bring his doll with him?

31:34.684 --> 31:36.895
There's one he carries everywhere.

31:36.978 --> 31:38.980
What did he wear? His shoes?
Can we be friends?

31:39.063 --> 31:41.190
Be informal with me too.
Sit back, get comfy.

31:41.274 --> 31:42.609
-Have some chocolate.
-Thanks.

31:42.692 --> 31:44.777
Leave your bag to the side.

31:44.861 --> 31:47.363
-Ask me one at a time.
-All right, thenâ€¦

31:49.157 --> 31:51.159
What's this? I didn't order anything.

31:51.242 --> 31:54.162
A teenager should eat.
Eat with her if you want.

31:54.245 --> 31:56.789
God, I'm so grateful that I might cry.

31:56.873 --> 32:00.710
Don't you cry.
So is he that Jin guy or whatever?

32:02.670 --> 32:04.088
-It's JUNE.
-Uncle Du-sik,

32:04.172 --> 32:07.175
can you not mistake the sacred name
bestowed upon my JUNE?

32:07.258 --> 32:10.136
Now I'm upset.
I see laser beams coming from your eyes.

32:10.219 --> 32:13.056
If you ask me, he's not handsome at all.

32:14.390 --> 32:16.392
-He's better looking than you!
-He's better looking than you!

32:16.476 --> 32:19.479
-Unbelievable. Just go.
-Yes, leave us.

32:19.562 --> 32:21.022
-Gosh.
-You two are so alike.

32:21.689 --> 32:23.107
Have fun then.

32:23.983 --> 32:25.902
-You're so alike.
-We got rid of him.

32:25.985 --> 32:28.947
-We did. You know, this isâ€¦
-I can hear you, Ju-ri.

32:29.030 --> 32:31.658
It was my first time seeing a celebrity
and he was glowing.

32:31.741 --> 32:33.242
-I bet his face was tiny.
-It was.

32:33.326 --> 32:35.703
-How does a person glow?
-No way!

32:35.787 --> 32:37.288
That I can never understand.

32:37.372 --> 32:39.457
-What's up with him?
-What's with him?

32:39.540 --> 32:41.459
-I hate him.
-So do I.

32:41.542 --> 32:42.961
You two are so alike.

32:43.044 --> 32:44.337
-Unbelievable.
-Unbelievable.

33:08.319 --> 33:10.279
-Gosh.
-Goodness, Chief Hong!

33:10.363 --> 33:12.407
Why won't you answer your phone?

33:12.490 --> 33:15.535
Du-sik, this is me in line.
I got here before Nam-suk did.

33:16.202 --> 33:17.578
No. I can't. No way.

33:17.662 --> 33:19.414
Don't be like that. Help me out.

33:19.497 --> 33:21.207
Delivery orders are piling up.

33:21.290 --> 33:23.668
I can't deliver
mushy <i>jjajangmyeon</i>, you know.

33:23.751 --> 33:25.253
<i>Jjajangmyeon</i> is good either way.

33:25.336 --> 33:28.047
Du-sik, the air conditioner
at my store broke down.

33:28.131 --> 33:31.592
If it's not fixed,
I'll be steamed alive today.

33:31.676 --> 33:33.845
-Let go of me. Is Nam-gyu still asleep?
-Yes.

33:33.928 --> 33:35.638
Then smack his back and wake him up.

33:35.722 --> 33:37.807
He's your brother,
but he's also your employee.

33:37.890 --> 33:40.184
Why go easy on him?
You shouldn't have hired him.

33:40.268 --> 33:41.978
He doesn't listen to a word I say.

33:42.061 --> 33:43.229
Why are you weeping?

33:43.312 --> 33:44.355
-And you.
-Yes?

33:44.439 --> 33:46.524
It's about time you fixed things yourself.

33:46.607 --> 33:48.693
For God's sake, you run a hardware store.

33:48.776 --> 33:50.903
How dare you? That's my biggest weakness.

33:50.987 --> 33:52.447
Are you both in tears? Damn it.

33:52.530 --> 33:55.366
Just know that I won't
be working at all today.

33:55.450 --> 33:57.410
I have a right to have the day off. Bye.

33:57.493 --> 34:01.414
-Asking you is our right. Please.
-I'll have to close up if you don't help!

35:12.985 --> 35:16.155
Mi-seon, how does fried chicken
and beer sound tonight?

35:17.406 --> 35:20.118
Maybe some other time.
I'd rather rest at home today.

35:20.785 --> 35:24.330
What's gotten into you?
You never say no to fried chicken.

35:27.208 --> 35:29.919
Hey, you don't look so well.

35:30.586 --> 35:32.630
-What?
-Are you sick?

35:32.713 --> 35:35.049
No, I'm just a little tired.

35:35.133 --> 35:39.095
Gosh, I guess I should
get you some herbal tonic.

35:42.014 --> 35:44.058
-Hello.
-Yes, welcome.

35:44.767 --> 35:47.228
-You can follow me right away.
-Sure.

35:50.189 --> 35:53.025
Thankfully, the nerve damage
was well-treated.

35:53.109 --> 35:55.778
We'll check for any pain,
then get you a crown.

35:55.862 --> 35:57.780
Ms. Pyo, can you make a mold?

35:58.364 --> 35:59.365
Sure.

36:17.884 --> 36:19.468
What should we have today?

36:21.220 --> 36:23.556
A street food diner
opened across the street.

36:23.639 --> 36:26.225
Street food? What are we, kids?

36:26.309 --> 36:28.436
But we get to order various dishes.

36:35.109 --> 36:36.485
Yu Cho-hui?

36:36.569 --> 36:37.695
Yeong-guk?

36:41.741 --> 36:44.577
You guys should go ahead without me.

36:44.660 --> 36:46.495
-I'll be right there.
-Sure.

36:47.788 --> 36:49.749
-You go ahead too.
-I'm fine, though.

36:49.832 --> 36:51.751
Go order our food.

36:51.834 --> 36:54.295
Right. What should I order though?

36:54.378 --> 36:56.881
<i>Tteokbokki</i> with
flour-based rice cakes and a boiled egg.

36:56.964 --> 37:00.927
As for <i>sundae</i>, I only want the middle
part. No liver, only lungs, and <i>gimmari</i>.

37:01.010 --> 37:02.428
-Get going already.
-Sure.

37:02.511 --> 37:04.138
-Wait. Don't pour the sauce.
-Sorry?

37:04.222 --> 37:06.140
Don't pour the sauce on the fritters.

37:13.397 --> 37:16.442
Has it been 15 years?

37:17.026 --> 37:20.738
Yes, but you haven't changed at all.

37:20.821 --> 37:22.949
You're the one who hasn't changed one bit.

37:23.032 --> 37:24.033
Gosh.

37:24.575 --> 37:25.952
What brings you here?

37:26.035 --> 37:29.830
I've been assigned to work
at Cheongjin Elementary School.

37:29.914 --> 37:32.458
I came to introduce myself today,
and I start next week.

37:32.541 --> 37:35.336
Are you staying in Gongjin for good then?

37:35.419 --> 37:37.171
Yes, I already moved here.

37:37.255 --> 37:38.506
I see.

37:39.924 --> 37:42.301
Goodness, look who it is.

37:43.970 --> 37:45.930
What do you mean? It's Mr. Chang.

37:46.597 --> 37:48.182
No, the woman next to him.

37:48.266 --> 37:50.059
Isn't it Yu Cho-hui?

37:50.142 --> 37:51.185
Who's that?

37:51.269 --> 37:52.853
Yeong-guk's first love.

37:53.562 --> 37:54.772
Really?

37:54.855 --> 37:57.775
Yes. Hey, I got to go.

38:00.194 --> 38:01.195
Where are you off to?

38:02.363 --> 38:03.447
Where is she going?

38:04.115 --> 38:06.867
-Have you had lunch?
-I was actually on my way to have it.

38:07.535 --> 38:09.704
Hwa-jeong?

38:10.496 --> 38:12.206
Ms. Yeo went home for a bit.

38:12.290 --> 38:14.792
Really? Why now of all moments?
Okay, see you.

38:14.875 --> 38:16.002
Bye.

38:26.387 --> 38:27.388
Mom.

38:28.764 --> 38:30.933
Why are you making so much food?

38:33.728 --> 38:34.562
What?

38:35.730 --> 38:36.564
No reason.

38:37.606 --> 38:41.444
It's nice to have a lot of food
in the house, isn't it?

38:50.536 --> 38:52.204
You're all done, sir.

38:53.789 --> 38:55.583
You can gargle.

39:00.421 --> 39:02.298
I can still feel residue in my mouth.

39:03.341 --> 39:06.635
There's a mirror next to you,
so please check yourself.

39:08.387 --> 39:10.389
I'd rather have you take a look.

39:21.150 --> 39:22.318
All right.

39:26.072 --> 39:27.156
That's it.

39:38.334 --> 39:39.960
Get your hand off her!

39:44.840 --> 39:46.717
You damn bastard.

39:46.801 --> 39:47.885
What?

39:47.968 --> 39:49.553
Let go of me for a second.

39:49.637 --> 39:53.474
-Hold on--
-You crazy bastard. How dare you.

39:53.557 --> 39:54.892
What did I do wrong?

39:54.975 --> 39:57.937
Don't think about lying.
I saw it with my own eyes!

39:58.020 --> 40:00.981
What did you see?
That I grabbed her for a second?

40:01.065 --> 40:02.191
Get away!

40:02.775 --> 40:03.651
Hold on.

40:04.318 --> 40:07.279
I just leaned on her a little
since I felt uncomfortable.

40:07.363 --> 40:09.240
There's nothing wrong about it.

40:09.323 --> 40:12.201
Don't you know the difference
between leaning and groping?

40:14.161 --> 40:16.539
A sexual predator like you
should be behind bars.

40:16.622 --> 40:18.582
-Mi-seon, call the police.
-What?

40:21.794 --> 40:23.254
Is this the police?

40:24.255 --> 40:26.674
Yes, this is Yoon Dental Clinic
in Gongjin.

40:26.757 --> 40:29.260
I'm being accused
of sexual harassment right now.

40:30.052 --> 40:32.096
No, I'm the victim here.

40:32.179 --> 40:33.681
Is that so?

40:33.764 --> 40:35.766
Got it. We'll be right there.

40:36.809 --> 40:39.603
-Are we being dispatched?
-It's Yoon Dental Clinic.

40:39.687 --> 40:41.564
-They need us there.
-Yoon Dental Clinic?

40:41.647 --> 40:44.859
Some guy called and said
he was being framed for sexual harassment.

40:44.942 --> 40:45.985
What?

40:46.068 --> 40:48.404
I should head over there
to get the full story.

40:48.487 --> 40:50.030
-I'll go with you.
-Stay alert!

40:50.114 --> 40:51.407
-See you later.
-See you.

40:54.160 --> 40:58.247
I've never been so aware
of the word "shameless" before.

40:58.330 --> 41:00.791
How brazen of you
to call the police yourself.

41:00.875 --> 41:03.836
I did nothing wrong,
so let the law decide.

41:03.919 --> 41:05.921
-You did nothing wrong?
-No.

41:06.005 --> 41:07.756
-You did nothing wrong?
-No.

41:07.840 --> 41:09.049
What a lunatic.

41:10.718 --> 41:13.429
Look here, Ms. Yoon Hye-jin.

41:14.013 --> 41:16.515
You may not know this
since you're a newcomer here,

41:16.599 --> 41:18.976
but everyone in Gongjin knows me.

41:19.059 --> 41:21.312
My father owns a concrete business here,

41:21.395 --> 41:23.939
and my uncle is a city councilman.

41:24.023 --> 41:25.566
So what? What about it?

41:25.649 --> 41:27.067
You just opened this clinic.

41:28.110 --> 41:30.696
If people find out
you're accusing an innocent person,

41:30.779 --> 41:32.364
you'll have to close up shop.

41:34.325 --> 41:35.367
Just let him go.

41:36.702 --> 41:39.038
-Are you nuts?
-I'm fine, so don't

41:39.788 --> 41:41.248
make a big deal out of it.

41:41.332 --> 41:44.126
Are you kidding me?
After what he did to you?

41:44.210 --> 41:47.546
I'm fine. It's not like
this is my first time.

41:47.630 --> 41:52.009
Which is why I can't let this go.
I'll have him punished, no matter what.

41:52.092 --> 41:53.427
-Right.
-Crazy bastard.

41:53.511 --> 41:55.846
I see she's the smarter one here.

41:55.930 --> 41:59.975
I mean, she's well aware that
she doesn't have the upper hand.

42:00.059 --> 42:01.352
Just think about it.

42:01.977 --> 42:05.397
Why would I even bother with a girl
like her? She's not on my level.

42:05.481 --> 42:06.899
You bastard!

42:07.399 --> 42:10.069
-Hye-jin--
-You littleâ€¦ Hey!

42:10.152 --> 42:11.195
Are you all right?

42:11.862 --> 42:14.490
You crazy bitch.

42:25.876 --> 42:27.336
-Are you okay?
-Chief Hong?

42:27.836 --> 42:29.922
So you're okay. That's a relief.

42:30.548 --> 42:32.341
I'm glad you're okay.

42:32.424 --> 42:33.676
Oh my.

42:37.888 --> 42:39.181
Did someone call the police?

42:43.686 --> 42:46.188
Du-sik, are you all right?

42:46.814 --> 42:48.440
-Are you all right?
-Waterâ€¦

42:48.524 --> 42:49.775
Who made the call?

42:50.776 --> 42:51.860
-Water.
-Hye-jin?

42:56.407 --> 42:57.283
Damn it.

42:59.535 --> 43:01.036
This is so annoying.

43:01.745 --> 43:03.414
Something must be broken.

43:03.497 --> 43:06.375
According to the doctor,
you have minor contusions.

43:06.458 --> 43:08.294
As if one can tell so easily.

43:08.377 --> 43:10.879
Let's see what the CT tells us.

43:10.963 --> 43:13.799
Anyway, I don't intend to settle

43:14.425 --> 43:17.136
and will sue them both for assault.

43:17.219 --> 43:18.887
The police are investigating.

43:18.971 --> 43:22.182
Protocol says you should be
investigated for sexual harassment too.

43:22.266 --> 43:25.936
You were brought here
only because you were in pain, so shut it.

43:26.020 --> 43:29.398
You sure love sexual harassment charges.
There is no evidence.

43:29.481 --> 43:32.359
The victim's testimony can
be evidence in this case.

43:32.443 --> 43:34.653
The law in Korea is a load of crap.

43:34.737 --> 43:38.532
Because you listen to gold-diggers,
innocent people like me are victimized.

43:38.616 --> 43:39.825
I told you to shut it.

43:41.744 --> 43:43.370
I should call my lawyer.

43:57.384 --> 43:58.969
Where's my phone?

44:08.354 --> 44:10.105
NORTHERN CHUNG-HO POLICE STATION

44:11.857 --> 44:13.567
<i>How is this fair?</i>

44:13.651 --> 44:16.612
That sick pervert should be arrested,

44:16.695 --> 44:18.614
not us.

44:19.615 --> 44:23.786
Also, you should have
separate holding cells for men and women.

44:26.121 --> 44:28.749
Excuse me. Can't you hear me?

44:30.042 --> 44:31.251
Excuse me!

44:32.127 --> 44:33.128
Damn it.

44:34.296 --> 44:36.382
One might think this is your bedroom.

44:38.300 --> 44:39.843
Where I sleep is my home.

44:40.678 --> 44:42.429
You should lie down too.

44:42.513 --> 44:45.974
Are you nuts?
What if someone gets the wrong idea?

44:47.976 --> 44:50.270
Don't just lie there, and do something.

44:50.354 --> 44:53.857
Leave me be.
I'm in the middle of recharging.

44:53.941 --> 44:55.401
But it was your day off today.

45:00.781 --> 45:03.325
How did you know
what was happening at the clinic?

45:05.160 --> 45:08.205
-Lieutenant Kim.
-Chief Hong, do you need anything?

45:08.288 --> 45:12.334
This wetsuit is so tight.
Can I change into something else?

45:12.418 --> 45:14.044
It must be suffocating.

45:14.128 --> 45:15.379
Tell me about it.

45:15.462 --> 45:16.922
Would my clothes be all right?

45:17.005 --> 45:18.132
I'd be grateful.

45:18.215 --> 45:19.842
-Then come out here.
-Sure.

45:19.925 --> 45:23.345
What the hell?
You pretended not to hear me just now.

45:24.638 --> 45:26.098
Excuse me.

45:26.181 --> 45:27.516
You completely ignored me.

45:30.060 --> 45:31.019
Where are you going?

45:31.103 --> 45:33.355
I'll be right back.
Keep the cell warm for me.

45:33.439 --> 45:35.315
-You changed the lock.
-Yes, we did.

45:35.399 --> 45:37.109
-Don't forget the key.
-Right.

45:37.192 --> 45:38.819
Why are you wearing this anyway?

45:38.902 --> 45:41.363
-Where are you going?
-Isn't the weather hot?

45:41.447 --> 45:43.198
-Did you catch sharks?
-What the hell?

45:43.282 --> 45:46.827
Gosh. Lieutenant Kim,
your taste in clothes

45:46.910 --> 45:49.705
is quite exotic.

45:50.497 --> 45:53.333
It puts me in a good mood
when I change after shifts.

45:53.417 --> 45:56.420
I love how smooth the fabric is.

45:57.671 --> 45:59.923
-Chief Hong.
-I'm thirsty. Got anything to drink?

46:00.007 --> 46:02.384
<i>How about a cup of coffee?</i>

46:02.468 --> 46:05.637
Sounds good. That was adorable.
Don't you have ice in the freezer?

46:05.721 --> 46:07.598
-Of course.
-Chief Hong!

46:07.681 --> 46:10.642
Okay, I hear you.
She wants one too, so make it two.

46:10.726 --> 46:11.935
-Two. Got it.
-Thanks.

46:12.019 --> 46:13.687
-I'm back.
-Hey, you're here.

46:13.770 --> 46:15.814
-Du-sik.
-How's he? I bet he's faking it.

46:15.898 --> 46:18.150
The CT scan shows no damage.

46:18.233 --> 46:21.320
Lieutenant, can't we now
release them bothâ€¦

46:21.403 --> 46:23.238
-I guess it's just the doctor.
-Sure.

46:24.907 --> 46:27.284
Ms. Dentist, get out here
and enjoy some iced coffee.

46:29.244 --> 46:31.371
Why haven't you arrested the pervert?

46:31.455 --> 46:34.833
He's currently in the hospital
and needs two weeks to recover--

46:34.917 --> 46:37.085
-I'm staying.
-What do you mean?

46:39.004 --> 46:40.506
I'm objecting to injustice.

46:40.589 --> 46:44.384
I won't leave
until that prick is arrested too.

46:45.594 --> 46:47.471
Why make life harder for yourself?

46:49.806 --> 46:50.849
Hye-jin!

46:53.644 --> 46:54.603
Hye-jin.

46:56.438 --> 46:58.524
-Mi-seon.
-Hey.

46:58.607 --> 47:00.442
Why on earth are you in here?

47:00.526 --> 47:02.402
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

47:02.486 --> 47:05.572
I'm fine. What about you?

47:05.656 --> 47:08.325
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

47:08.408 --> 47:12.329
Why are you apologizing?
You didn't do anything wrong.

47:12.412 --> 47:14.456
I tried to put up with it--

47:14.540 --> 47:18.544
Nonsense! You should've told me sooner.

47:19.086 --> 47:23.131
If I had known, I wouldn't have
kept leaving you with that pervert.

47:23.215 --> 47:27.302
I know you went through a lot
to open the clinic.

47:28.220 --> 47:29.513
You're in the red,

47:29.596 --> 47:32.558
but you still gave me my paycheck
and a bonus.

47:32.641 --> 47:35.352
Your clinic was finally running smoothly.

47:35.435 --> 47:38.355
I was afraid it might be all ruined
if I told you.

47:38.939 --> 47:40.732
None of that is important!

47:40.816 --> 47:44.736
You should've told me. I'm your friend.

47:46.989 --> 47:49.116
You must've been so scared, Mi-seon.

47:50.826 --> 47:52.077
I'm so sorry.

47:54.580 --> 47:56.832
No, I should be the one apologizing.

47:56.915 --> 48:00.294
No, I'm the one who let you down.

48:04.756 --> 48:08.051
I'll make sure
that the bastard is behind bars, Mi-seon.

48:08.135 --> 48:11.221
That freaking bastard!

48:15.058 --> 48:17.436
Guys, the door is open, you know.

48:20.439 --> 48:22.024
You can come out.

48:30.073 --> 48:32.492
-Hey.
-Ms. Gam-ri, what brings you by?

48:32.576 --> 48:37.539
Well, I came to report lost property.

48:38.040 --> 48:43.587
You see, I found this
on the floor of the dental clinic.

48:43.670 --> 48:45.922
Doesn't it belong to that guy?

48:47.257 --> 48:48.091
Here.

48:48.759 --> 48:52.346
Wait. He did say he lost his phone.

49:00.145 --> 49:01.813
I see you're reading a comic book.

49:01.897 --> 49:04.274
What? What are you doing here?

49:04.358 --> 49:05.901
I'm here to see how you're doing.

49:06.735 --> 49:09.571
Don't you remember?
We went to middle school together.

49:10.197 --> 49:14.451
<i>The deep blue energy of the East Sea</i>

49:14.534 --> 49:16.995
<i>Flows within us</i>

49:17.079 --> 49:19.539
The assailant shouldn't visit the victim.

49:19.623 --> 49:22.501
You must've hurt your brain
when I beat you up.

49:22.584 --> 49:25.379
You're the assailant here.
A sick sexual predator.

49:26.963 --> 49:29.424
Assault and falsely accusing someone
without any proof?

49:29.508 --> 49:32.886
Proof? I have it somewhere.

49:33.553 --> 49:35.555
Wait. Where did I put it?

49:37.099 --> 49:38.684
Where did I put it?

49:38.767 --> 49:40.811
You sure are a crazy bastard.

49:41.770 --> 49:43.063
Here it is.

49:44.481 --> 49:45.565
Where did you get that?

49:45.649 --> 49:47.234
A fairy godmother gave it to me.

49:47.317 --> 49:49.069
Bullshit. Give it back.

49:49.152 --> 49:52.823
Why? Does it make you
anxious that I have it?

49:53.323 --> 49:55.158
-What's in it?
-Give it back!

49:55.242 --> 49:56.284
Give it back.

49:58.704 --> 50:00.163
What--

50:00.247 --> 50:02.624
Wait, that hurts. Let go!

50:02.708 --> 50:03.917
-Should I let go?
-Yes!

50:04.000 --> 50:05.836
-Would you if you were me?
-Let go of me!

50:05.919 --> 50:07.421
Let's wait here a bit

50:07.504 --> 50:09.631
-until your warrant is served.
-What?

50:09.715 --> 50:13.218
You took so many photos
that your phone memory's full.

50:13.802 --> 50:15.512
You dirty little Peeping Tom.

50:15.595 --> 50:18.974
Wait! Okay, fine.
Let go of me so we can talk. It hurts.

50:19.057 --> 50:21.601
-Does it hurt? A lot?
-It does. Yes!

50:21.685 --> 50:26.481
If that hurts,
can you imagine how hurt your victims are?

50:27.274 --> 50:30.110
Just you wait.
I'll make sure you pay for what you did.

50:30.193 --> 50:33.530
What's it to you?
Why are you so hellbent on this?

50:33.613 --> 50:36.908
Do you have something going on
with one of those women?

50:36.992 --> 50:40.412
That's right. There's something huge
going on between us.

50:40.495 --> 50:42.998
Really? Wait, that hurts!

50:43.081 --> 50:46.001
You chose the wrong people to mess with.

50:46.084 --> 50:48.253
Fine. Just let me go first. Hold on!

50:48.336 --> 50:49.921
-Cut your hair.
-Fine, I will.

50:50.005 --> 50:51.548
You never shut up.

50:51.631 --> 50:53.759
I'll cut my hair.
I will as soon as you let go.

50:53.842 --> 50:55.302
Okay, hold still.

50:55.385 --> 50:56.553
I tapped out. Let me go.

50:56.636 --> 50:58.013
-You tapped out?
-Let go.

51:05.854 --> 51:08.148
I hear Chief Hong
caught a Peeping Tom yesterday.

51:08.231 --> 51:09.691
So I heard.

51:09.775 --> 51:12.360
No wonder he's the hero of Gongjin.

51:12.444 --> 51:14.654
He's like Superman and Iron Man
wrapped into one.

51:14.738 --> 51:17.115
-Mr. Ban, what about me then?
-Sorry?

51:17.199 --> 51:21.161
If Chief Hong is everyone's fixer,
what am I in this town?

51:21.244 --> 51:22.496
Mr. Changâ€¦

51:24.080 --> 51:26.208
Where do you think you're going?

51:29.711 --> 51:32.881
-Cho-hui?
-Hi, I'm here to register my move.

51:32.964 --> 51:36.218
I see. I'm glad you're here.

51:36.301 --> 51:38.220
That way. Come with me.

51:38.303 --> 51:40.138
-Come on.
-Okay.

51:42.432 --> 51:45.644
Hwa-jeong, why aren't you
picking up your phone?

51:45.727 --> 51:47.562
What? What's this about?

51:48.063 --> 51:51.107
I saw someone yesterday, you see.

51:51.191 --> 51:52.275
Who?

51:59.282 --> 52:00.492
RESIDENT REGISTRATION

52:02.035 --> 52:03.119
RESIDENT: 1 PERSON

52:04.746 --> 52:05.664
Wait.

52:06.206 --> 52:08.667
Are you still single?
Didn't you get married?

52:09.251 --> 52:11.127
I never got around to doing it.

52:13.713 --> 52:15.799
I see.

52:16.508 --> 52:18.802
So you're single. You aren'tâ€¦

52:20.303 --> 52:22.389
I heard you got married though.

52:22.472 --> 52:24.599
Me? Wellâ€¦

52:25.976 --> 52:29.646
I did but I'm single now.

52:29.729 --> 52:31.356
I'm completely on my own now.

52:31.439 --> 52:33.567
You and Hwa-jeong got divorced?

52:35.277 --> 52:36.486
My goodness.

52:43.159 --> 52:45.871
So this must be the front row seat.

52:45.954 --> 52:47.247
Your wife is here. Hello.

52:47.330 --> 52:48.665
Hey, jerk!

52:50.584 --> 52:53.753
I told you not to call her that anymore.

52:54.337 --> 52:57.924
I guess I'll always be your wife to him.

52:59.426 --> 53:02.596
-Hwa-jeong.
-Goodness, it's been so long.

53:04.472 --> 53:05.640
Did you move here?

53:05.724 --> 53:06.850
Yes.

53:07.434 --> 53:08.810
Have you been well?

53:08.894 --> 53:11.771
Yes. Although not all the time.

53:13.690 --> 53:16.443
You haven't changed a bit.
You're still so pretty.

53:25.619 --> 53:27.329
-Mr. Ban.
-Yes?

53:27.412 --> 53:30.498
Ms. Yeo is here to get the garbage bags.

53:30.582 --> 53:32.208
Please take her to them.

53:32.292 --> 53:34.419
Got it. Ms. Yeo, this way.

53:34.502 --> 53:36.463
-I'm coming.
-Good.

53:42.677 --> 53:43.678
Let's take it outside.

53:45.180 --> 53:47.098
Hold on. Why are they leaving?

53:47.682 --> 53:49.726
Please sign here.

53:52.771 --> 53:54.564
Here you go.

53:55.732 --> 53:56.733
Have a good day.

53:59.486 --> 54:00.654
Hey, Hwa-jeong.

54:01.154 --> 54:02.280
They went out together.

54:27.722 --> 54:29.724
Gosh, they don't fit.

54:36.523 --> 54:37.816
We're set for a month.

54:39.985 --> 54:41.611
Let me see.

54:41.695 --> 54:43.989
Hwa-jeong, my gosh.

54:58.211 --> 55:01.548
I'm going out to pick up a sandwich
for lunch. What would you like?

55:01.631 --> 55:02.966
I'll go with you.

55:03.049 --> 55:06.094
No, it's fine. Do what you were doing.
It's only around the corner.

55:06.177 --> 55:08.930
Are you sure? Then I'll have the same one.

55:09.014 --> 55:10.432
Wheat bread, roast chicken,

55:10.515 --> 55:13.893
mozzarella cheese, minus pickles,
but with lots of sliced olives. Right?

55:15.020 --> 55:18.356
A good best friend is worth
ten boyfriends. I'll be right back.

55:19.107 --> 55:19.983
Mi-seon.

55:20.650 --> 55:21.484
Yes?

55:21.568 --> 55:25.030
From now on, whatever happens,
don't hide it from me.

55:25.697 --> 55:28.908
Friends are supposed
to have each other's backs.

55:29.451 --> 55:30.744
Pyo Mi-seon.

55:32.162 --> 55:34.247
You're the only friend I have, you know.

55:34.330 --> 55:35.206
I know that.

55:37.500 --> 55:38.752
Get going then.

55:38.835 --> 55:40.253
Get me the same!

55:55.185 --> 55:56.436
Ms. Pyo!

55:58.897 --> 56:02.442
"Serving the people
are the warm, trustworthy police."

56:05.236 --> 56:06.613
That's our catchphrase.

56:08.239 --> 56:10.283
Calling 112 will surely be faster,

56:11.993 --> 56:13.995
but have this with you, just in case.

56:19.709 --> 56:21.044
CHOI EUN-CHEOL

56:22.337 --> 56:24.798
And if anything like that happens again,

56:25.590 --> 56:28.093
don't try to endure it on your own.

56:30.804 --> 56:31.888
Have a good day.

56:40.271 --> 56:42.273
DOCTOR YOON HYE-JIN

56:46.861 --> 56:48.238
<i>He admitted to his crimes</i>

56:48.321 --> 56:52.617
<i>and will be investigated soon
by the Women Sex Crime Unit.</i>

56:52.700 --> 56:54.202
<i>I thought you should know.</i>

56:59.165 --> 57:02.877
Come to think of it,
I never thanked him properly.

57:07.966 --> 57:09.592
I guess I could just leave it here.

57:17.308 --> 57:18.935
This wine wasn't easy to get.

57:19.018 --> 57:20.728
I guess the fruit will do.

57:22.313 --> 57:23.690
No.

57:24.566 --> 57:26.734
I should repay him properly.

57:33.825 --> 57:34.993
This is killing me.

57:37.579 --> 57:38.830
I bet it's really good.

57:40.039 --> 57:41.458
It's so hard to let go.

57:42.542 --> 57:45.128
I hear it's spicy, fragrant,

57:45.211 --> 57:46.421
-and sweet.
-What's up?

57:46.504 --> 57:47.755
My gosh!

58:15.074 --> 58:16.659
I enjoyed the monologue.

58:16.743 --> 58:19.078
I felt so many emotions
in such a short time.

58:19.162 --> 58:21.498
It was so hard to get the wine.
That's why.

58:21.581 --> 58:25.502
You must've wanted it so bad that you
agreed to drink it together right away.

58:26.294 --> 58:28.213
Your place is really nice.

58:29.130 --> 58:30.965
I thought it'd be a stinky bachelor pad.

58:31.049 --> 58:34.135
Don't judge a book by its cover.
That's being prejudiced.

58:35.261 --> 58:38.640
Why do you have so many books and records?

58:38.723 --> 58:41.601
I collected them
hoping they'd be worth a lot someday.

58:41.684 --> 58:45.772
I see. It may seem fancy,
but it's actually a junk collection.

58:45.855 --> 58:48.691
Junk? Unbelievable.

58:51.736 --> 58:52.612
What?

58:54.572 --> 58:56.699
<i>I saw this photo at the photo studio.</i>

58:57.200 --> 58:58.159
Is this you?

58:59.536 --> 59:00.370
Yes.

59:02.705 --> 59:03.873
I see.

59:05.291 --> 59:06.960
Is the old man your grandfather?

59:07.043 --> 59:09.462
Yes. He passed away
when I was in middle school.

59:12.215 --> 59:13.841
What about the rest of your family?

59:13.925 --> 59:15.009
I have no one.

59:15.760 --> 59:16.761
No one?

59:16.844 --> 59:18.555
My parents died when I was six,

59:18.638 --> 59:19.889
so I live here alone.

59:21.975 --> 59:23.059
Sorry.

59:24.143 --> 59:26.729
You don't have to be.
Can you fetch the glasses?

59:26.813 --> 59:27.689
Sure.

59:36.781 --> 59:39.492
You made all this just now?

59:40.034 --> 59:41.452
It's not much.

59:43.496 --> 59:46.082
It seems like
it'll pair well with the wine.

59:48.293 --> 59:49.335
This particular wine

59:49.919 --> 59:52.630
is from the RhÃ´ne region
in Southern France.

59:53.131 --> 59:56.634
Since it's a vintage wine,
it should be decantedâ€¦

59:59.679 --> 1:00:01.472
Let me explain what decanting is.

1:00:01.556 --> 1:00:04.851
You pour wine into another vessel
without disturbing the sediment--

1:00:04.934 --> 1:00:08.813
Old wine like this may
lose the scent if you decant it.

1:00:08.896 --> 1:00:10.940
I uncorked it as soon as we got in.

1:00:11.733 --> 1:00:13.526
-Are you well-versed in wine?
-No.

1:00:13.610 --> 1:00:15.445
It's just something I picked up.

1:00:15.528 --> 1:00:19.115
I see. Hand it over then.
Let me pour you a glass.

1:00:21.034 --> 1:00:21.868
Hear that?

1:00:24.954 --> 1:00:25.955
Gosh.

1:00:30.710 --> 1:00:31.586
Just a second.

1:00:32.545 --> 1:00:35.048
When drinking wine,

1:00:36.090 --> 1:00:39.218
you should first enjoy it
by breathing in its scent.

1:00:40.511 --> 1:00:45.099
Like this. Then, sip the wine
while letting in air as well.

1:00:46.726 --> 1:00:47.894
Here.

1:00:49.729 --> 1:00:51.189
Seriously?

1:00:51.773 --> 1:00:53.524
That's gross. What are you doing?

1:00:57.737 --> 1:01:01.532
You should lower your head to close
your airway and then breathe in the air.

1:01:01.616 --> 1:01:04.160
It was a mistake. Gosh, that stings.

1:01:04.243 --> 1:01:05.703
Stop that and just drink it.

1:01:05.787 --> 1:01:09.457
You might sneeze
the expensive wine out of your nose.

1:01:13.836 --> 1:01:15.421
Can you stop that already?

1:01:17.340 --> 1:01:18.299
Gosh.

1:01:23.304 --> 1:01:24.514
That's how you do it.

1:01:26.057 --> 1:01:26.891
Give it a go.

1:01:32.939 --> 1:01:34.232
Hello. Come on in.

1:01:34.315 --> 1:01:35.858
Yes, hello.

1:01:35.942 --> 1:01:37.318
Please sit anywhere you want.

1:01:37.402 --> 1:01:39.404
Okay. JUNE, where do you want to sit?

1:01:40.780 --> 1:01:42.365
-By the window.
-Sure thing.

1:01:47.036 --> 1:01:48.830
You were quite the singer.

1:01:50.456 --> 1:01:52.667
I only sang because Chun-jae asked.

1:01:55.294 --> 1:01:56.129
Soâ€¦

1:01:57.046 --> 1:01:59.716
will you sing for me if I ask?

1:02:00.299 --> 1:02:02.969
-Go home already.
-We didn't finish the wine.

1:02:12.478 --> 1:02:14.647
You seemed close with the police officers.

1:02:15.690 --> 1:02:19.068
You were practically at home
at the station.

1:02:19.861 --> 1:02:21.446
Have you been there often?

1:02:21.529 --> 1:02:23.197
I guess you can say that.

1:02:23.281 --> 1:02:25.700
-So you were a troublemaker.
-Not like that.

1:02:25.783 --> 1:02:27.910
I've won the Brave Citizen Award twice.

1:02:27.994 --> 1:02:29.620
-Really?
-Yes.

1:02:30.455 --> 1:02:34.041
I once caught
a purse snatcher on the street.

1:02:34.125 --> 1:02:35.376
Stop!

1:02:46.179 --> 1:02:51.017
<i>And this other time, I saved a drunk
old man sleeping on the train tracks.</i>

1:02:53.728 --> 1:02:54.562
Sir!

1:03:06.866 --> 1:03:08.242
That's courageous of you.

1:03:09.243 --> 1:03:11.120
How did you manage to jump on the tracks?

1:03:11.204 --> 1:03:13.414
I didn't think. My body just reacted.

1:03:13.498 --> 1:03:16.834
Does anyone appreciate it though?
I bet there wasn't any reward.

1:03:16.918 --> 1:03:17.919
I got a million won.

1:03:18.002 --> 1:03:20.046
I bought a new fridge
for the senior center.

1:03:20.129 --> 1:03:24.091
You should be generous
only when you're financially stable.

1:03:24.801 --> 1:03:26.636
You barely make a living.

1:03:26.719 --> 1:03:29.722
Don't worry about me,
and drink your wine. Here.

1:03:31.599 --> 1:03:34.811
I guess how you live your life
is none of my business.

1:03:46.405 --> 1:03:47.782
We're out of wine.

1:03:57.625 --> 1:04:00.169
That I can't offer you,
but I do have some whiskey.

1:04:05.716 --> 1:04:07.927
Ju-ri, can you get this
to those customers?

1:04:08.010 --> 1:04:09.470
-I'm good, Dad.
-Well, I'm not.

1:04:09.554 --> 1:04:11.806
I have something else on the stove.
Now, hurry.

1:04:11.889 --> 1:04:13.516
-Be careful.
-Come on.

1:04:13.599 --> 1:04:14.809
Help your dad out.

1:04:14.892 --> 1:04:17.478
He can't do anything properly, seriously.

1:04:20.273 --> 1:04:22.483
Here. Your food's here.

1:04:22.567 --> 1:04:23.693
Thank you.

1:04:33.828 --> 1:04:35.037
Enjoy.

1:04:35.121 --> 1:04:36.330
Thank you.

1:04:39.750 --> 1:04:44.130
God, he must've put so much effort
to look like JUNE.

1:04:45.798 --> 1:04:48.092
Ju-ri, you almost fell for a copycat.

1:04:48.718 --> 1:04:50.344
Jeez, he gives me the creeps.

1:04:54.432 --> 1:04:55.975
Let's eat. Dig in.

1:04:56.976 --> 1:04:58.019
Check this out.

1:04:59.228 --> 1:05:02.315
It must be because we're by the sea.
Look at the size of the seafood.

1:05:02.398 --> 1:05:03.566
This shrimp is huge.

1:05:04.400 --> 1:05:05.484
You're right.

1:05:06.485 --> 1:05:07.486
Dig in.

1:05:08.112 --> 1:05:10.990
JUNE, I guess you should work even harder.

1:05:12.116 --> 1:05:14.493
People don't even recognize you,

1:05:15.202 --> 1:05:16.662
so will this show survive?

1:05:17.163 --> 1:05:18.289
I think it'll tank.

1:05:18.372 --> 1:05:21.459
We'll still get paid though.
Can I order a <i>pajeon</i> too?

1:05:21.542 --> 1:05:22.668
Go ahead.

1:05:23.210 --> 1:05:24.712
-Sir.
-Yes?

1:05:27.506 --> 1:05:30.384
Are you already drunk?
I thought you could hold your liquor.

1:05:32.720 --> 1:05:33.679
I'm not drunk.

1:05:35.973 --> 1:05:40.311
It just feels like I'm on clouds.

1:05:41.729 --> 1:05:44.190
You'll soon fly in the sky then.

1:05:46.567 --> 1:05:49.654
I never get drunk if I can help it.

1:05:50.237 --> 1:05:51.280
Why not?

1:05:51.864 --> 1:05:53.115
Because I hate it.

1:05:54.492 --> 1:05:56.202
Being out of it,

1:05:57.954 --> 1:05:59.413
being vulnerable,

1:06:00.164 --> 1:06:01.624
and being more honest.

1:06:05.586 --> 1:06:07.380
When I feel close to being drunk,

1:06:10.007 --> 1:06:13.219
I clench my fists tight like so.

1:06:15.304 --> 1:06:17.974
You live an exhausting life,
with such small fists.

1:06:19.642 --> 1:06:21.727
-I have a big fist.
-Here.

1:06:32.905 --> 1:06:36.409
Don't you get lonely living here alone?

1:06:38.452 --> 1:06:42.164
That has never occurred to me
since the people here are like family.

1:06:42.915 --> 1:06:44.792
How long have you been living in Gongjin?

1:06:45.459 --> 1:06:46.585
Since birth.

1:06:47.837 --> 1:06:49.422
Have you ever left this place?

1:06:51.257 --> 1:06:52.174
I have.

1:06:53.300 --> 1:06:54.427
When?

1:06:57.263 --> 1:06:59.098
You told me not to cross the line,

1:06:59.598 --> 1:07:01.350
but you ask so many questions.

1:07:02.643 --> 1:07:04.353
Right.

1:07:06.022 --> 1:07:07.106
What's with me today?

1:07:07.898 --> 1:07:09.525
I'm usually not like this.

1:07:10.192 --> 1:07:12.403
You don't seem to know yourself that well.

1:07:14.030 --> 1:07:16.032
Maybe I'm fascinated by you.

1:07:16.907 --> 1:07:19.118
We're from two different worlds.

1:07:19.702 --> 1:07:23.247
If a penguin from Antarctica
met a polar bear from the North,

1:07:23.330 --> 1:07:24.790
would it feel this way?

1:07:25.416 --> 1:07:27.668
They're both from
freezing climates though.

1:07:28.294 --> 1:07:29.211
Right, of course.

1:07:30.337 --> 1:07:32.840
Well, I guess opposites attract.

1:07:34.633 --> 1:07:38.637
Okay. You can ask me just one question.

1:07:39.305 --> 1:07:41.515
I'll answer it this one time.

1:07:42.975 --> 1:07:44.268
I don't have any questions.

1:07:50.608 --> 1:07:51.650
I've got one.

1:07:52.818 --> 1:07:54.111
Why did you come to Gongjin?

1:07:57.615 --> 1:08:00.659
And don't say you came here
to open a dental clinic to make money.

1:08:01.243 --> 1:08:04.121
If that was the case,
it didn't have to be Gongjin.

1:08:05.331 --> 1:08:06.832
My face is red, isn't it?

1:08:07.333 --> 1:08:10.002
It's so hot in here. Maybe I'm drunk.

1:08:12.338 --> 1:08:14.465
Don't answer if you don't want to.

1:08:21.347 --> 1:08:22.389
That day.

1:08:24.016 --> 1:08:26.519
The day I came to Gongjinâ€¦

1:08:28.729 --> 1:08:30.272
was my mom's birthday.

1:08:34.860 --> 1:08:36.445
It's sad

1:08:37.530 --> 1:08:42.409
how your birthday gets erased after
you die and only the day you died remains.

1:08:47.665 --> 1:08:52.962
It feels like the fact that my mom
even existed has been slowly fading away.

1:08:57.091 --> 1:09:01.303
If she had been alive,
she would've turned 60 that day.

1:09:05.891 --> 1:09:09.895
I would've gone on many trips with her

1:09:11.355 --> 1:09:14.108
and bought her expensive purses.

1:09:16.110 --> 1:09:18.779
Actually, no.

1:09:19.655 --> 1:09:22.491
Just a meal together
would've been nice enough.

1:09:26.954 --> 1:09:28.789
Before she died,

1:09:30.332 --> 1:09:32.251
we went on a family trip

1:09:33.544 --> 1:09:34.670
to Gongjin.

1:09:45.472 --> 1:09:47.099
What am I doing?

1:09:48.767 --> 1:09:50.144
I must be drunk.

1:09:51.103 --> 1:09:53.022
My face is burning up.

1:09:54.023 --> 1:09:55.774
I think I have a mild fever.

1:09:59.904 --> 1:10:01.238
Is my face red?

1:10:21.342 --> 1:10:22.635
It's so hot.

1:11:08.347 --> 1:11:09.682
Hey, Ms. Gam-ri.

1:11:09.765 --> 1:11:12.142
<i>Chief Hong, where are you now?</i>

1:11:12.226 --> 1:11:13.936
Why? What's wrong?

1:11:14.019 --> 1:11:16.772
<i>There's a commotion at the dentist's.</i>

1:11:18.607 --> 1:11:21.610
Chief Hong wouldn't budge
no matter how much I begged.

1:11:21.694 --> 1:11:24.863
-Tell me about it. He didn't even listen.
-I know.

1:11:24.947 --> 1:11:28.200
What did I tell you?
Chief Hong has one rule in life.

1:11:28.284 --> 1:11:31.829
He works when he wants
and has fun when he feels like it.

1:11:31.912 --> 1:11:34.248
The man may bend backwards for everyone,

1:11:34.331 --> 1:11:36.625
but he never works on his day off.

1:11:40.546 --> 1:11:42.172
He runs that hard on his day off?

1:11:42.256 --> 1:11:43.340
I take it back.

1:12:22.588 --> 1:12:24.757
<i>There are three mysteries in Gongjin.</i>

1:12:24.840 --> 1:12:26.717
<i>Just eat as casually as possible.</i>

1:12:26.800 --> 1:12:28.927
-The two slept together?
-Gosh.

1:12:29.011 --> 1:12:32.514
How can you pair Du-sik with the dentist?

1:12:32.598 --> 1:12:34.516
I'm a doctor.
I graduated dentistry school.

1:12:34.600 --> 1:12:36.018
Chief Hong is from
Seoul National University.

1:12:36.101 --> 1:12:38.270
Why does my ear itch so much?

1:12:41.315 --> 1:12:43.525
-Actually, I'mâ€¦
-You must be a <i>mukbang </i>Youtuber.

1:12:44.526 --> 1:12:47.446
-What?
<i>-I think I blacked out yesterday.</i>

1:12:47.529 --> 1:12:48.989
But when you blacked out,

1:12:49.073 --> 1:12:51.158
-did it become rated R?
-Hey!

1:12:51.241 --> 1:12:54.286
<i>So anyway, did anything happen yesterday?</i>

1:12:54.370 --> 1:12:55.371
<i>Wellâ€¦</i>

1:12:56.747 --> 1:12:57.915
A lot happened.

1:12:57.998 --> 1:13:03.003
