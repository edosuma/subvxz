12:04.057 --> 12:06.028
Well, you heard her.
I ain't pull no trigger.

12:06.028 --> 12:09.736
I've got a CIA officer who had
burns all over his chest.

12:09.736 --> 12:11.205
How'd they get there?

12:11.205 --> 12:13.844
I don't know, cooking rock?
Dangerous business.

12:16.248 --> 12:17.885
Your mother's
throwing her life away

12:17.885 --> 12:20.056
trying to publicly out the CIA.

12:20.056 --> 12:21.493
You don't think
she's gonna talk to us?

12:21.493 --> 12:24.164
(chuckles)
My mother's fucking crazy.

12:24.164 --> 12:25.801
Ain't nobody gonna
believe that shit.

12:25.801 --> 12:28.472
- Irene Abe would have.
- Yeah, Irene Abe's dead.

12:28.472 --> 12:30.076
Yeah.

12:30.076 --> 12:32.515
Yeah, and so are Andre Wright

12:32.515 --> 12:36.055
and Kevin Hamilton
and Jerome Saint.

12:36.055 --> 12:37.457
Now a CIA officer

12:37.457 --> 12:39.294
to go along with
how many others along the way?

12:41.098 --> 12:43.336
I know what the fuck you are.

12:43.336 --> 12:46.075
I might be the only one
on the planet that does,

12:46.075 --> 12:47.778
but I do.

12:47.778 --> 12:49.047
Oh, yeah?

12:51.853 --> 12:54.792
Then do something
about it then, nigga.

12:55.861 --> 12:57.097
Go ahead.

12:57.097 --> 12:59.067
Pull that gun and use it.

13:10.189 --> 13:12.862
(car engine starts)

13:12.862 --> 13:15.466
Uncle Tom-ass nigga.

13:34.639 --> 13:37.110
You think Franklin would
come after you?

13:39.181 --> 13:40.918
No.

13:40.918 --> 13:43.523
He know he can't touch me here.

13:47.163 --> 13:50.169
Without Cissy's money, the
shelter ain't gonna stay open.

13:50.169 --> 13:52.875
In two weeks, it'll shut down.

13:52.875 --> 13:55.113
All those people will be
back out on the streets.

14:05.601 --> 14:08.439
I made my decision, Lee.

14:08.439 --> 14:11.078
I'm going back to Ghana.

14:12.480 --> 14:14.519
I got enough money
for a one-way ticket,

14:14.519 --> 14:17.357
and I'll figure out the rest
when I get there.

14:28.947 --> 14:30.951
(footsteps retreating)

14:32.420 --> 14:33.590
(drawer opens)

14:35.026 --> 14:36.596
Uh, Leon, I don't want
your money...

14:36.596 --> 14:38.099
Stop.

14:42.975 --> 14:45.446
You're my wife,
and this is your money, too.

14:47.283 --> 14:50.256
We'll get you to Ghana,

14:50.256 --> 14:52.293
so you can start a new life.

15:01.111 --> 15:03.349
(sniffles)

15:04.384 --> 15:06.923
You not even gonna
ask me not to go?

15:15.406 --> 15:17.243
- Leon.
- No.

15:20.416 --> 15:22.487
(gate beeping)

15:31.405 --> 15:33.375
GUARD:
Empty your pockets.

15:33.375 --> 15:35.146
Put it in the tray.

15:35.146 --> 15:38.119
GUARD 2:
Follow the yellow line. Next.

15:38.119 --> 15:39.956
Stop at the line.

15:49.742 --> 15:51.980
(gate blares)

15:56.188 --> 15:58.693
(lock buzzes, latch clicks)

15:58.693 --> 16:00.964
(indistinct chatter)

16:12.220 --> 16:14.024
(lifts receiver)

16:25.614 --> 16:27.551
Hey, Mama.

16:29.487 --> 16:31.559
How you doing? You all right?

16:36.636 --> 16:38.540
I spoke to Prentice.

16:40.476 --> 16:43.717
Said he could still help you.

16:43.717 --> 16:47.691
Nobody enters a guilty plea
for first-degree murder.

16:49.495 --> 16:51.198
You request new counsel,

16:51.198 --> 16:54.070
say you weren't
in your right mind.

16:54.070 --> 16:56.141
After yesterday,

16:56.141 --> 16:58.747
people will believe it.

17:00.651 --> 17:04.257
Can't run your mouth
like that again, Mama.

17:04.257 --> 17:07.197
You hear me?

17:07.197 --> 17:09.769
Can't provoke these people.

17:09.769 --> 17:12.508
They'll hang you
by your bedsheets in here.

17:12.508 --> 17:14.745
You understand what I'm saying?

17:20.857 --> 17:22.595
(sighs)

17:28.607 --> 17:31.378
Why'd you do this, Mama?

17:32.413 --> 17:34.384
Huh?

17:36.623 --> 17:39.194
He was about to make
the transfer.

17:42.433 --> 17:44.605
We were so fucking close.

17:46.208 --> 17:48.412
Ten seconds.

17:48.412 --> 17:50.684
You couldn't wait
ten fucking seconds?

17:52.588 --> 17:54.224
Huh?

18:05.847 --> 18:08.252
(Franklin sighs)

18:19.207 --> 18:21.244
♪ ♪

18:29.495 --> 18:31.532
(knocking on door)

18:35.674 --> 18:38.613
(knocking continues)

18:45.761 --> 18:47.731
- Ah, Franklin.
- Mr. Davis.

18:47.731 --> 18:49.802
May I come in?

18:51.673 --> 18:53.877
Uh, yeah, sure.

18:53.877 --> 18:57.183
Thank you.

18:57.183 --> 18:59.622
Very nice to see you, Franklin.

18:59.622 --> 19:01.358
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

19:01.358 --> 19:03.630
Listen, I'm sorry to just
show up like this, but, uh,

19:03.630 --> 19:05.433
I stopped by your office,

19:05.433 --> 19:07.871
and it was very much closed,

19:07.871 --> 19:10.911
so I thought I'd stop by here
while I was in the area.

19:10.911 --> 19:13.917
Okay, is, uh, something
I could help you with?

19:13.917 --> 19:15.721
Well, I want to discuss
your offer,

19:15.721 --> 19:18.325
and I thought it best
we sit down in person.

19:19.495 --> 19:20.797
Sorry, my offer?

19:20.797 --> 19:22.568
Yes.

19:22.568 --> 19:24.538
Selling your stake in
the Spring Street development.

19:26.475 --> 19:28.747
We are interested, but

19:28.747 --> 19:31.418
before we get into
vetting the numbers,

19:31.418 --> 19:35.326
I wanted to personally ask you
about this situation

19:35.326 --> 19:36.529
with your mother.

19:36.529 --> 19:38.700
I'm sorry,
you've been misinformed.

19:38.700 --> 19:40.871
About which part?

19:40.871 --> 19:44.444
My stake. It ain't for sale.

19:45.547 --> 19:46.949
Your partner reached out to us,

19:46.949 --> 19:48.753
and said that, uh,
you wanted to...

19:48.753 --> 19:51.358
- My partner was wrong.
- (stammers)

19:55.834 --> 19:58.405
Anything else?

20:02.848 --> 20:04.250
No.

20:05.587 --> 20:07.991
I suppose not.

20:07.991 --> 20:10.731
You have yourself a good day.

20:14.337 --> 20:16.274
(door closes)

20:40.489 --> 20:43.262
I've been paging you.
Where you been?

20:43.262 --> 20:45.366
Oh, I've been a lot of places,
but it started out

20:45.366 --> 20:47.470
with a meeting with Paul Davis.

20:47.470 --> 20:49.975
(sighs)

20:49.975 --> 20:52.614
I wanted to test the waters.

20:52.614 --> 20:54.752
See what we'd be looking at
if we decided to sell.

20:54.752 --> 20:57.624
I thought I was very clear that
we're not selling downtown, V.

20:57.624 --> 21:00.797
I didn't see how it could hurt
to have the numbers at hand.

21:00.797 --> 21:02.467
(chuckles) Oh, you didn't see
how it could hurt?

21:02.467 --> 21:05.005
My lady going behind my back,

21:05.005 --> 21:07.845
soliciting offers
with our competitors,

21:07.845 --> 21:09.013
showing our weakness?

21:09.013 --> 21:11.485
Okay, then.

21:11.485 --> 21:12.921
It won't happen again.

21:12.921 --> 21:15.861
Oh, I know
it won't happen again.

21:17.498 --> 21:20.469
I made a deal to sell
the South Central properties,

21:20.469 --> 21:23.543
so we can finance Spring Street
for as long as possible.

21:26.516 --> 21:27.985
VERONIQUE:
What?

21:27.985 --> 21:30.991
You sold all of
the South Central buildings?

21:30.991 --> 21:32.393
Today?

21:32.393 --> 21:34.965
Single buyer with deep pockets.

21:34.965 --> 21:36.969
One familiar enough
with the area

21:36.969 --> 21:39.307
and the business model
to see a great deal

21:39.307 --> 21:40.744
when it's
right in front of them.

21:40.744 --> 21:42.480
Not to mention,

21:42.480 --> 21:44.852
personal motivation
to buy us out.

21:44.852 --> 21:47.323
My mother's old boss,

21:47.323 --> 21:48.960
Arnold Tulfowitz.

21:50.462 --> 21:52.433
(scoffs)

21:54.137 --> 21:55.607
Well, shit.

21:57.043 --> 21:59.582
- You just threw it all away.
- No.

21:59.582 --> 22:01.719
- You just sunk us.
- No. No, no, no.

22:01.719 --> 22:03.422
- I don't think I have.
- No?

22:03.422 --> 22:04.725
No.

22:06.361 --> 22:08.633
But even if I have,

22:08.633 --> 22:11.839
I built it, right?

22:13.475 --> 22:16.616
And if I want to tear it
all down, then that's

22:16.616 --> 22:18.586
what the fuck I'm gonna do.

22:19.788 --> 22:21.859
(sighs)

22:22.661 --> 22:26.736
Yo
u remember what
I said to you in Malibu

22:26.736 --> 22:29.374
- on the bluff that day?
- You said you needed my loyalty.

22:29.374 --> 22:31.411
No, no, no, baby,
that's not all

22:31.411 --> 22:33.115
I said to you.

22:34.685 --> 22:36.822
(Veronique grunts)

22:36.822 --> 22:39.495
Don't ever go behind
my fucking back again,

22:39.495 --> 22:40.630
you hear me?

22:40.630 --> 22:43.368
Get the fuck off me.

22:56.629 --> 22:58.098
(Veronique exhales)

23:02.139 --> 23:04.878
(lock buzzes, latch clicks)

23:04.878 --> 23:08.051
Blue isn't exactly
my color, right?

23:09.989 --> 23:12.126
Don't look at me like that.

23:18.606 --> 23:20.744
I did the only thing
I could possibly do

23:20.744 --> 23:22.814
and still live with myself.

23:25.085 --> 23:26.656
Yeah.

23:28.158 --> 23:29.828
Well, you should know,

23:29.828 --> 23:31.732
people in the neighborhood
been talking,

23:31.732 --> 23:33.703
and they calling you a hero.

23:33.703 --> 23:35.005
Mm.

23:37.544 --> 23:40.449
But they're the only ones
talking about it, right?

23:42.587 --> 23:43.823
Yeah.

23:44.925 --> 23:47.598
Yeah. I also wanted you to know,

23:47.598 --> 23:49.902
I'm-a keep funding the shelter.

23:49.902 --> 23:52.574
Just not gonna let it die.

23:53.543 --> 23:55.647
That is good news.

23:57.249 --> 23:59.855
How's Wanda handling everything?

24:07.571 --> 24:09.173
Not great.

24:09.173 --> 24:11.111
She, uh...

24:11.111 --> 24:12.914
hit her breaking point,

24:12.914 --> 24:14.718
and went back to Ghana.

24:20.664 --> 24:23.903
I so admire

24:23.903 --> 24:27.577
all that you're doing,

24:27.577 --> 24:29.848
but I fucking hate
the way you're doing it.

24:31.017 --> 24:33.623
I didn't come here for advice.

24:33.623 --> 24:37.163
I came here to see if there's
anything I can do for you.

24:39.835 --> 24:41.872
Okay.

24:41.872 --> 24:45.179
Well, here's what
you can do for me:

24:45.179 --> 24:47.918
pack a suitcase full of books,

24:47.918 --> 24:50.022
get on a plane,

24:50.022 --> 24:52.961
and go to your wife in Ghana.

24:54.631 --> 24:58.539
Go find out who you want
to be in this world, Leon.

24:58.539 --> 25:02.246
And when you're
really ready to atone...

25:02.246 --> 25:04.785
come back.

25:10.329 --> 25:12.768
Franklin's lost.

25:13.536 --> 25:17.711
One of
the greatest tragedies
of my life.

25:20.049 --> 25:21.217
(sighs)

25:21.217 --> 25:23.055
But you

25:23.055 --> 25:26.495
are one of my
greatest surprises.

25:28.065 --> 25:30.603
I don't want to lose you, too.

25:32.641 --> 25:34.712
Don't do that to me.

25:37.083 --> 25:38.786
And write.

25:40.757 --> 25:43.261
It's gonna get
pretty lonely in here.

25:55.620 --> 25:57.858
(crying):
I love you.

26:00.730 --> 26:02.667
Love you, too.

26:04.638 --> 26:06.174
Go. (sniffles)

26:12.654 --> 26:13.990
(sniffles)

26:19.400 --> 26:21.337
(exhales shakily)

26:31.826 --> 26:33.863
(siren wailing in distance)

26:45.285 --> 26:47.289
(indistinct chatter)

27:04.958 --> 27:06.662
PHILLIP:
Mr. Saint.

27:06.662 --> 27:08.398
Phil.

27:08.398 --> 27:10.135
- How you doing, man?
Nice to see you.
- PHILLIP: Have a seat.

27:10.135 --> 27:12.674
(sighs)

27:12.674 --> 27:14.745
So, uh... (chuckles)

27:14.745 --> 27:17.316
We need to rip out
the entire foundation

27:17.316 --> 27:18.820
and re-pour it.

27:18.820 --> 27:20.690
I'm suing, of course,

27:20.690 --> 27:22.092
but, in the meantime,

27:22.092 --> 27:24.765
I need to, uh, increase
the line of credit

27:24.765 --> 27:26.669
to the construction loan

27:26.669 --> 27:29.106
and cut a cashier's check
to GY Concrete

27:29.106 --> 27:32.112
for $129,000, please.
You know,

27:32.112 --> 27:34.250
just get the ball going.

27:34.250 --> 27:37.356
Is this maybe what Veronique
was here about earlier?

27:42.333 --> 27:43.970
Sorry, what?

27:43.970 --> 27:46.976
Ms. Turner,
she was here this morning

27:46.976 --> 27:49.748
and made a substantial
cash withdrawal.

27:52.152 --> 27:53.823
Um...

27:56.160 --> 27:58.833
(laughs)

27:58.833 --> 28:02.373
I-I'm sorry, Phil, um...

28:02.373 --> 28:05.412
How substantial?

28:05.412 --> 28:07.283
PHILLIP:
I'll need to verify
the exact amount,

28:07.283 --> 28:10.155
but it was the majority
of the available funds.

28:10.155 --> 28:13.094
Somewhere in the neighborhood
of $800,000.

28:15.032 --> 28:16.234
FRANKLIN:
Yeah.

28:17.904 --> 28:19.808
Yeah, um,

28:19.808 --> 28:22.814
that must be where
got our-our lines crossed.

28:22.814 --> 28:26.421
I'll-I'll talk to her
and I'll get it handled.

28:26.421 --> 28:29.126
Yeah.

28:29.126 --> 28:32.032
Yeah, yeah, that must've been
where our lines,

28:32.032 --> 28:35.138
our signal got crossed.

28:35.138 --> 28:37.844
Um, I'll talk to her.

28:37.844 --> 28:40.249
Yeah, and I'll get it handled.

28:43.355 --> 28:45.392
PHILLIP: I suppose
I don't need to point out

28:45.392 --> 28:47.296

59:37.261 --> 59:40.100
I said,
"Leave me the fuck alone.

59:40.100 --> 59:44.141
Huh? Leave me the fuck alone
or I'm-a start talking."

59:46.647 --> 59:48.149
And that did it.

59:50.153 --> 59:53.026
(laughs)
That fucking did it.

59:54.930 --> 59:57.902
Man.
(laughs softly)

59:57.902 --> 1:00:00.307
(indistinct radio chatter)

1:00:00.307 --> 1:00:01.309
(car door shuts)

1:00:01.309 --> 1:00:02.879
Hmm.

1:00:10.026 --> 1:00:11.897
(pounding on door)

1:00:11.897 --> 1:00:13.901
CARRON (distant):
This is the L.A.
Sheriff's Department.

1:00:13.901 --> 1:00:16.339
We have a warrant for seizure
for nonpayment of back taxes.

1:00:16.339 --> 1:00:18.811
Like I said.

1:00:18.811 --> 1:00:21.650
No, they-they can't take
your fucking house.

1:00:21.650 --> 1:00:23.888
- (scoffs)
- (pounding on door)

1:00:23.888 --> 1:00:25.056
Why?

1:00:25.056 --> 1:00:27.227
CARRON: Make this easy.

1:00:27.227 --> 1:00:29.733
- (pounding on door)
- They done took everything else.

1:00:29.733 --> 1:00:31.737
CARRON: Open this door now
or we'll open it ourselves.

1:00:31.737 --> 1:00:33.741
They gonna take that shit, too.

1:00:33.741 --> 1:00:36.179
Look, I'll pay the property
taxes and I'll clean

1:00:36.179 --> 1:00:38.818
- this shit up myself.
- Stop.

1:00:38.818 --> 1:00:40.353
Stop.

1:00:40.353 --> 1:00:43.661
You don't understand,
Yo-Yo. I'm...

1:00:43.661 --> 1:00:46.667
(exhales)

1:00:46.667 --> 1:00:49.906
I ain't got no fucking chains
on me, man.

1:00:52.846 --> 1:00:54.749
Hey.

1:00:57.755 --> 1:00:59.793
I'm free.

1:01:03.066 --> 1:01:04.903
Free from all of it.

1:01:04.903 --> 1:01:07.842
In my fucking way. Not yours.

1:01:07.842 --> 1:01:09.913
And not theirs.

1:01:13.386 --> 1:01:14.990
(grunts)

1:01:14.990 --> 1:01:17.094
(laughs)

1:01:25.143 --> 1:01:27.849
You my best friend.

1:01:29.285 --> 1:01:31.857
Best friend I ever fucking had.

1:01:35.163 --> 1:01:38.369
And I'm fucking proud of you.

1:01:43.781 --> 1:01:46.820
You hear me?

1:01:46.820 --> 1:01:48.223
Huh?

1:01:50.327 --> 1:01:52.231
(paper crinkles)

1:01:57.140 --> 1:01:59.278
(ragged exhale)

1:01:59.278 --> 1:02:02.017
I'm good. (clears throat)

1:02:07.929 --> 1:02:10.133
(sighs) Fuck.

1:02:12.137 --> 1:02:13.707
Saint.

1:02:18.951 --> 1:02:20.888
Saint!
