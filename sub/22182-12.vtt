WEBVTT

00:02.670 --> 00:03.504
RICHARD:
Go, go, go, go, go!

00:03.537 --> 00:04.772
They have the package.

00:04.805 --> 00:06.374
Everyone brace!

00:06.407 --> 00:08.309
GALLO:
We're going down.

00:08.342 --> 00:09.710
HASKINS:
Jimmy Kam's been captured.

00:09.743 --> 00:11.245
My name is Khalid Samatar.

00:11.279 --> 00:12.313
I am the man
who has your soldiers.

00:12.346 --> 00:15.249
PORTER:
Sergeant Hendrix is dead.

00:15.283 --> 00:16.684
JIMMY:
You'll pay for
Sergeant Hendrix.

00:16.717 --> 00:18.319
Someday.

00:18.352 --> 00:20.288
You will pay.

00:20.321 --> 00:21.655
Jimmy.

00:21.689 --> 00:22.590
I don't have much time.

00:22.623 --> 00:24.392
A man named Khalid

00:24.425 --> 00:27.395
has sent uranium to an associate
in the U.S. to make a bomb.

00:27.428 --> 00:29.130
I've been going through evidence
from the bomber's apartment,

00:29.163 --> 00:31.432
and I found this. Floor plans
for an event center in Atlanta.

00:31.465 --> 00:33.201
They're having a huge
international affairs

00:33.234 --> 00:34.402
conference this Saturday.

00:34.435 --> 00:36.070
My mom is gonna be there.

00:36.104 --> 00:37.738
We now have a confirmed location
on Khalid Samatar.

00:37.771 --> 00:39.573
HASKINS: We have
high confidence

00:39.607 --> 00:42.343
he is holding Sergeant Kam in
the bunker under this building.

00:42.376 --> 00:44.078
We hover here,
they fast-rope down.

00:44.112 --> 00:48.182
We both know our relationship
has some... blurry lines.

00:52.520 --> 00:55.189
GALLO:
Now we go get Jimmy.

00:56.190 --> 00:58.058
Yeah.

01:00.494 --> 01:04.465
* I don't know
what you've been told *

01:04.498 --> 01:07.701
* But this here
is not your home *

01:07.735 --> 01:10.738
* If you want some trouble

01:10.771 --> 01:13.807
* You want some

01:13.841 --> 01:15.643
* Then come on in...

01:15.676 --> 01:17.745
Rotor blades on. Good to go.

01:17.778 --> 01:20.614
We're still missing
our Agency guys.

01:20.648 --> 01:22.416
Yeah, maybe they stood us up.

01:22.450 --> 01:24.218
* Some trouble...

01:24.252 --> 01:26.187
No such luck.

01:26.220 --> 01:28.256
GALLO:
Thanks for making it.

01:28.289 --> 01:29.590
I couldn't bear doing
this without our...

01:29.623 --> 01:31.159
friendly Agency spooks.

01:31.192 --> 01:32.226
Boo.

01:32.260 --> 01:33.394
* Blood in the water...

01:33.427 --> 01:35.763
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Reminder:

01:35.796 --> 01:37.498
I give the orders
to the ground guys in this bird.

01:37.531 --> 01:38.432
That includes you two.

01:38.466 --> 01:39.500
Yes, sir.

01:39.533 --> 01:40.901
And...

01:40.934 --> 01:43.671
if we find Khalid out there,
he's mine.

01:43.704 --> 01:45.206
For Hendrix. You got that?

01:45.239 --> 01:46.907
GALLO:
All right.

01:46.940 --> 01:48.276
Let's get this show on the road.

01:48.309 --> 01:49.510
COOGAN:
Sir, you mind

01:49.543 --> 01:50.911
if I say a prayer before we go?

01:50.944 --> 01:52.746
Didn't know you were religious,
Sergeant.

01:52.780 --> 01:55.216
I'm a private kind of guy.

01:55.249 --> 01:57.451
Why don't you lead us?

01:57.485 --> 01:58.586
All right.

01:58.619 --> 01:59.720
Hey.

02:04.625 --> 02:07.195
Dear God...

02:07.228 --> 02:10.331
or, uh, whatever it is
y'all hold sacred,

02:10.364 --> 02:11.865
we look to you for strength

02:11.899 --> 02:14.235
as we start one of the most
important missions

02:14.268 --> 02:15.636
we've ever done.

02:15.669 --> 02:18.606
Help us get Sergeant Kam out
safe tonight.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.374
Help us bring him home. Amen.

02:20.408 --> 02:21.409
Amen.

02:29.283 --> 02:31.819
*

02:40.294 --> 02:42.796
Good morning, Operation Perseus.

02:42.830 --> 02:44.232
How we looking?

02:44.265 --> 02:45.399
Black Hawks and Little
Birds are ready.

02:45.433 --> 02:46.567
Take-off's in five.

02:46.600 --> 02:48.269
You get all dressed up for us?

02:48.302 --> 02:51.839
No. No, I have that speaking
engagement this afternoon.

02:51.872 --> 02:55.409
Unfortunate timing, but my
job is cleaning up messes,

02:55.443 --> 02:57.411
and this operation
no longer is one.

02:57.445 --> 02:58.812
I just wanted
to stop by

02:58.846 --> 03:00.047
for the kickoff.
Sir,

03:00.080 --> 03:02.283
I gave my recommendation that
that conference be canceled.

03:02.316 --> 03:03.884
We found the floor plan
in the bomber's apartment.

03:03.917 --> 03:05.486
We have strong reason

03:05.519 --> 03:06.920
to believe the conference
is his target.

03:06.954 --> 03:08.622
U-Until we find him...

03:08.656 --> 03:11.625
You know how this works-- we
cannot let the terrorists win.

03:11.659 --> 03:13.894
We cancel, someone will leak the
reason, and next thing you know,

03:13.927 --> 03:15.429
all of downtown Atlanta's gonna
want to evacuate.

03:15.463 --> 03:17.931
Maybe that is not
such a bad idea, sir.

03:17.965 --> 03:19.567
The bomber's face has been
distributed

03:19.600 --> 03:22.303
to every law enforcement agency
in the country.

03:22.336 --> 03:23.371
We will have him soon.

03:23.404 --> 03:25.673
In the meantime,
the event space

03:25.706 --> 03:27.375
has been swept,

03:27.408 --> 03:29.277
security has been tripled,
metal detectors,

03:29.310 --> 03:31.279
bomb-sniffing dogs, the works.

03:31.312 --> 03:33.581
All right, people, it's go time.

03:33.614 --> 03:34.548
Renegade and Hammer elements,

03:34.582 --> 03:37.017
this is Anchor Zero-Six.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.319
You are cleared to fly.

03:40.020 --> 03:41.355
Roger that, sir.

03:41.389 --> 03:43.424
Let's kick the tires
and start the fires.

03:53.301 --> 03:55.603
Members of Operation Perseus,

03:55.636 --> 03:57.538
this is what we've been working
toward for months.

03:57.571 --> 04:00.408
Our mission is to rescue
Sergeant Jimmy Kam

04:00.441 --> 04:02.943
and capture Khalid Samatar,
alive if possible.

04:02.976 --> 04:04.745
The Little Birds will take out

04:04.778 --> 04:08.316
the anti-aircraft installation,
one klick from the objective.

04:08.349 --> 04:10.618
Once they do,
Khalid will know we're coming.

04:10.651 --> 04:11.619
Our intel indicates

04:11.652 --> 04:13.020
that he has a dozen men with him

04:13.053 --> 04:14.688
in the bunker.
We should anticipate

04:14.722 --> 04:16.624
a firefight.
Renegade One-Two

04:16.657 --> 04:19.827
will do a fast-rope op
to deliver Ground Team Alpha.

04:19.860 --> 04:22.596
Renegade One-One will follow,
delivering Bravo Team.

04:22.630 --> 04:25.699
30 miles from this location is a
village that is loyal to Khalid.

04:25.733 --> 04:27.868
We should expect that he will
send for reinforcements.

04:27.901 --> 04:30.638
So we need to be in and out of
there before they can get there.

04:30.671 --> 04:33.341
50 minutes.

04:33.374 --> 04:34.375
That's the clock
we'll be up against.

04:34.408 --> 04:38.011
It all comes down to this,
folks. Get it done.

04:39.947 --> 04:41.515
Hey, we just got a
hit on the bomber.

04:41.549 --> 04:43.417
Spotted entering a building
in downtown Atlanta.

04:44.518 --> 04:45.486
MAGNUS:
You should go.

04:45.519 --> 04:47.655
And maybe, uh...

04:47.688 --> 04:49.490
Colonel, can you spare
Lieutenant Porter?

04:49.523 --> 04:51.459
He and Thea have been working
on this since the beginning.

04:51.492 --> 04:53.594
They have two hours of flying
still to do.

04:53.627 --> 04:54.795
Go.

05:08.442 --> 05:10.678
In a few hours' time,

05:10.711 --> 05:14.482
I will finally have my revenge
on your country.

05:15.616 --> 05:16.884
A dirty bomb will be delivered

05:16.917 --> 05:18.819
to an event
with many important people

05:18.852 --> 05:20.688
of your government,
including

05:20.721 --> 05:23.424
the man who started all this.

05:23.457 --> 05:27.861
KHALID: This man promised
to return my brother to me

05:27.895 --> 05:29.663
if I would work for him.

05:31.465 --> 05:33.567
He betrayed me,

05:33.601 --> 05:37.838
as your country has betrayed
mine countless times before.

05:37.871 --> 05:41.041
Now he will die,

05:41.074 --> 05:42.910
and many more.

05:45.045 --> 05:46.647
I want you
to watch it

05:46.680 --> 05:48.916
as it is reported.

05:48.949 --> 05:52.486
Then I will kill you, too.

05:52.520 --> 05:55.756
I'm not afraid anymore.

05:58.792 --> 06:02.730
You know,
I think that might be true.

06:06.166 --> 06:07.668
Don't let him look away.

06:29.623 --> 06:30.758
You know I hate
going into a mission

06:30.791 --> 06:32.626
without tying up loose ends.

06:32.660 --> 06:34.662
We should talk about
what happened last night.

06:34.695 --> 06:36.764
Probably should.

06:36.797 --> 06:37.931
It was, uh...

06:37.965 --> 06:39.166
Really something?

06:40.601 --> 06:41.935
Really something.

06:41.969 --> 06:44.938
But all that matters right
now is this mission.

06:44.972 --> 06:46.474
Of course.

06:46.507 --> 06:48.476
And after this,
we still have to come clean

06:48.509 --> 06:50.578
about what we've been hiding,
play that out.

06:50.611 --> 06:54.582
Right. Lot of uncertainty
on the horizon.

06:54.615 --> 06:55.949
No point in making plans.

06:55.983 --> 06:59.019
Then... we're good.

06:59.052 --> 07:00.554
No loose ends.

07:00.588 --> 07:03.524
We're good. Tied with a bow.

07:03.557 --> 07:05.425
And we have a job to do.

07:17.838 --> 07:18.906
Agent Perez.

07:18.939 --> 07:19.840
Our guy entered the building

07:19.873 --> 07:21.842
approximately 15 minutes ago.

07:21.875 --> 07:23.210
He's in an apartment
on the 23rd floor.

07:23.243 --> 07:24.945
Looks like he's renting it
under an assumed name.

07:24.978 --> 07:26.780
What about the other residents?

07:26.814 --> 07:27.948
We got 'em out, quietly.

07:27.981 --> 07:29.517
My team's in position,
bomb squad is, too.

07:29.550 --> 07:31.552
Let's not keep them waiting.

07:57.711 --> 07:58.679
Hey, he's on the balcony!

07:58.712 --> 08:00.213
FBI! You're under arrest!

08:00.247 --> 08:01.148
Hands where we can see 'em!

08:15.095 --> 08:17.097
Stop!
No!

08:32.813 --> 08:35.282
COOGAN:
Hey, you two are, uh,
pretty quiet up there.

08:35.315 --> 08:39.653
Or you just chatting it up
on your little private channel?

08:39.687 --> 08:41.655
Nothing to report, Sergeant.

08:41.689 --> 08:43.290
Smooth sailing
so far.

08:43.323 --> 08:44.925
Best friends, these two.

08:44.958 --> 08:47.761
I swear, it's all secret
handshakes and whispers.

08:47.795 --> 08:48.896
It's just the cutest.

08:48.929 --> 08:50.197
GALLO:
We got a dance routine

08:50.230 --> 08:51.732
we'll bust out when we land.

08:51.765 --> 08:53.767
You'll love it.
COOGAN:
Oh.

08:53.801 --> 08:56.103
I hope it's not interpretive,
'cause I can't stand that crap.

08:58.071 --> 08:59.940
We're approaching
the release point.

08:59.973 --> 09:01.041
I have the controls.

09:01.074 --> 09:02.776
You have the controls.

09:07.815 --> 09:09.950
Four klicks out.
GALLO: All looks clear.

09:11.652 --> 09:14.221
RENEGADE ONE-ONE PILOT:
Renegade One-One is taking fire!

09:20.694 --> 09:21.829
Can you see where it came from?

09:24.097 --> 09:26.333
Negative.
There wasn't supposed to be
anybody out this far.

09:26.366 --> 09:27.567
Must be a guard post.

09:32.239 --> 09:33.073
Khalid knows we're there.

09:33.106 --> 09:35.676
Clock's started.

09:35.709 --> 09:37.110
We got to find the damn shooter.

09:44.885 --> 09:45.853
I can't see the shooter.

09:45.886 --> 09:47.187
You need to find him, Sergeant.

09:49.222 --> 09:51.058
There he is, three o'clock.

09:53.961 --> 09:55.195
COOGAN:
He's down.

09:55.228 --> 09:57.197
Hooah.

09:57.230 --> 09:58.398
Target neutralized.

09:58.431 --> 09:59.967
Continuing on to the objective.

10:04.304 --> 10:06.173
Khalid knows we're there now,
a lot sooner than we counted on.

10:06.206 --> 10:07.941
We're gonna need
to pick up speed.

10:07.975 --> 10:09.810
Hammer elements are engaging
the anti-aircraft threat.

10:09.843 --> 10:12.746
MAGNUS: Colonel, you're not
going to want to miss this.

10:12.780 --> 10:15.816
Little Bird's about
to fire, and... boom.

10:15.849 --> 10:19.086
Got it. Your people are good.
Renegade One-Two,

10:19.119 --> 10:20.921
what's your status?
MADANI:
Three klicks out.

10:21.989 --> 10:23.423
Better be ready to jump out

10:23.456 --> 10:25.793
and run, run, run
as fast as you can.

10:43.410 --> 10:45.913
It seems they have found us.

10:45.946 --> 10:47.981
The cavalry's here, bitch.

10:48.015 --> 10:50.851
It is not over yet.

10:50.884 --> 10:52.786
And you...

10:52.820 --> 10:54.254
are not going home.

10:56.023 --> 10:57.257
Let's go.

10:58.892 --> 11:00.293
Let's go.

11:04.297 --> 11:07.034
You may be useful to me still.

11:23.483 --> 11:26.286
Ah, you're back.

11:26.319 --> 11:28.889
What is the latest
on our jumper?

11:28.922 --> 11:31.291
FBI found a partially completed
bomb in the apartment.

11:31.324 --> 11:32.826
No sign of the uranium.

11:32.860 --> 11:33.894
They're going through
his personal effects,

11:33.927 --> 11:34.828
see what else
they can dig up.

11:34.862 --> 11:37.030
But let's not bury the lead,
so to speak.

11:37.064 --> 11:39.232
Our bomber is dead
and that is a good thing.

11:39.266 --> 11:41.902
Before he jumped, he
said we were too late.

11:41.935 --> 11:43.170
What if he's not working alone?

11:43.203 --> 11:44.504
What if Khalid has
another contact?

11:44.537 --> 11:45.906
Sir, there is
uranium out there

11:45.939 --> 11:47.440
because an Agency
operation went wrong.

11:47.474 --> 11:49.943
It's our responsibility
to find it and button this up.

11:49.977 --> 11:51.444
The FBI handles domestic, right?

11:51.478 --> 11:54.081
So let them do their job.

11:54.114 --> 11:56.850
You need to focus on bringing
Jimmy Kam home.

11:56.884 --> 11:58.218
HASKINS:
Renegade One-Two

11:58.251 --> 12:00.520
is 60 seconds
from the objective.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.055
MAGNUS:
Outstanding.

12:02.089 --> 12:04.992
Officer Thea, uh, you
can take it from here.

12:05.025 --> 12:06.960
You're seriously
leaving right now?
Well, you've proven to me

12:06.994 --> 12:08.796
that you can handle
Agency lead on this.

12:08.829 --> 12:10.263
Don't tell me you
don't want that.

12:10.297 --> 12:12.499
Yeah, thank you, sir,
I do, but...
Then enjoy it.

12:12.532 --> 12:14.935
Colonel.

12:14.968 --> 12:17.404
This has been an honor
and a pleasure.

12:17.437 --> 12:19.039
Bring him home.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.240
We will.

12:20.273 --> 12:22.409
Call me if you need.

12:33.253 --> 12:35.055
HASKINS:
Renegade One-Two,

12:35.088 --> 12:36.356
that shooter derailed
our clock.

12:36.389 --> 12:37.490
You need to get us
back on track.

12:37.524 --> 12:39.827
Not the time to be hasty, sir.

12:39.860 --> 12:41.862
We planned two minutes
to navigate these wires.

12:41.895 --> 12:42.930
That's what we need.

12:42.963 --> 12:44.364
I need you to do it in half.

12:44.397 --> 12:45.565
Yes, sir.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.534
You got it.

12:47.567 --> 12:50.003
You have the controls.

12:50.037 --> 12:51.438
I have the controls.

13:18.999 --> 13:20.433
Stone-cold badass.

13:20.467 --> 13:22.002
Alpha Team, you're up.

13:22.035 --> 13:23.303
All right. Go, go, go, go.

13:31.044 --> 13:33.013
Spooks, your turn.

13:33.046 --> 13:34.447
Come on, we're burning
fuel and seconds here.

13:38.051 --> 13:40.287
Thanks for the ride. Five stars.

13:42.923 --> 13:44.157
Alpha Team's on the ground.

13:44.191 --> 13:45.158
Good work.

13:45.192 --> 13:46.593
Renegade One-One is approaching
with Bravo Team.

13:47.594 --> 13:49.062
We'll clear the way.

14:14.922 --> 14:17.524
Four tangos down.

14:29.069 --> 14:31.338
We found the way
into the bunker.

14:31.371 --> 14:32.639
Hold your position
for Bravo Team arrival.

14:32.672 --> 14:33.640
You'll go in together.

14:33.673 --> 14:36.276
Yes, sir.

14:40.080 --> 14:41.148
MADANI:
Renegade One-Two,

14:41.181 --> 14:42.582
wires cleared.

14:42.615 --> 14:44.251
Headed to the exfil LZ.

14:47.955 --> 14:49.356
We just lost engine two.

14:49.389 --> 14:50.557
Mayday, Mayday.

14:50.590 --> 14:51.591
Renegade One-Two is hit.

14:51.624 --> 14:52.692
Say again.

14:52.725 --> 14:54.561
We're hit.
Low rotor's out.

14:54.594 --> 14:56.396
Pulling PCLs aft.

14:56.429 --> 14:58.465
Lowering collective
for autorotation.

14:58.498 --> 15:00.267
I'm gonna try and bring us down
as soft as I can.

15:12.345 --> 15:14.381
GALLO: Anchor Zero-Six,
this is Renegade One-Two.

15:14.414 --> 15:15.182
We've lost our tail rotor.

15:15.215 --> 15:16.083
MADANI:
We've got fire back there.

15:16.116 --> 15:17.517
Renegade One-One,
do you have visual?

15:17.550 --> 15:18.986
MAN:
Negative, sir.

15:19.019 --> 15:19.852
MADANI:
Low rotor audio.

15:19.886 --> 15:20.653
Putting collective
all the way down.

15:20.687 --> 15:21.521
Madani, watch
your rate of descent.

15:21.554 --> 15:24.524
MADANI:
Say again. We are going down.

15:24.557 --> 15:25.959
Brace! Brace!

15:25.993 --> 15:27.160
Brace for impact!

15:41.474 --> 15:43.410
Gallo.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.178
I'm okay.

15:45.212 --> 15:46.513
You?

15:46.546 --> 15:48.248
Yeah.

15:48.281 --> 15:49.449
Yeah.

15:49.482 --> 15:51.418
GALLO:
Harris?
I'm okay.

15:51.451 --> 15:52.452
Where's Sergeant Cho?

15:52.485 --> 15:54.654
Cho!

15:56.156 --> 15:57.457
Go. I'm right behind you.

16:03.230 --> 16:04.197
I found Cho!

16:04.231 --> 16:05.498
She's here!

16:07.034 --> 16:08.601
Hey, hey.

16:08.635 --> 16:10.503
Are you okay?

16:10.537 --> 16:13.006
Peachy keen, jelly bean.
Doesn't look that way.

16:13.040 --> 16:14.607
My left foot's broken
pretty bad, I think.

16:14.641 --> 16:15.342
Let's get you up.

16:15.375 --> 16:17.244
Anyone see what hit us?

16:17.277 --> 16:19.079
GALLO:
No idea what the hell it was.

16:19.112 --> 16:20.347
But I'll tell you what.

16:20.380 --> 16:22.215
You hadn't been so quick
on those controls,

16:22.249 --> 16:23.650
this crash would've been
a lot worse.

16:23.683 --> 16:25.385
Anchor Zero-Six,

16:25.418 --> 16:26.586
this is Madani.

16:26.619 --> 16:28.621
We had a pretty hard landing,
but all are accounted for.

16:28.655 --> 16:29.622
What's the damage?

16:29.656 --> 16:34.294
Cho's leg and Adele.

16:34.327 --> 16:36.363
She's not flying out of here.

16:36.396 --> 16:37.697
PORTER:
We have to reroute

16:37.730 --> 16:38.665
Renegade One-One.

16:38.698 --> 16:40.433
We can't risk letting
Bravo Team rope out

16:40.467 --> 16:42.102
into an LZ with hostiles.

16:42.135 --> 16:44.104
It can land here
and approach on foot.

16:44.137 --> 16:46.039
They need to get to a secure
position inside that building.

16:46.073 --> 16:47.474
Can you move Sergeant Cho?

16:48.675 --> 16:50.510
She's not gonna thank us for it,

16:50.543 --> 16:52.112
but yeah.

16:52.145 --> 16:53.646
We'll cover you.
GALLO:
All right.

16:53.680 --> 16:54.781
You ready for this?

16:54.814 --> 16:56.416
Born ready.
Attagirl.

16:56.449 --> 16:58.418
This'll be fun. Come on.

17:28.381 --> 17:31.851
No hostiles out there.
Not a one.

17:31.884 --> 17:33.553
So who shot our tail rotor?

17:33.586 --> 17:34.621
COOGAN:
Anchor Zero-Six,

17:34.654 --> 17:35.622
what's the ETA

17:35.655 --> 17:36.789
on Bravo Team?

17:36.823 --> 17:38.791
Renegade One-One
has been rerouted.

17:38.825 --> 17:40.393
Bravo arrival in ten minutes.

17:40.427 --> 17:41.761
So we're short half a team?

17:41.794 --> 17:43.130
HASKINS:
Correct.

17:43.163 --> 17:45.265
Wonderful.

17:45.298 --> 17:48.635
Gallo, Madani,
you guys decent shots?
Yeah.

17:48.668 --> 17:50.237
You know what,
just give me competent.

17:50.270 --> 17:51.504
You up for ground work?
Okay.

17:51.538 --> 17:52.739
The pilots are
coming with us?

17:52.772 --> 17:54.507
Yes, we need all
the help we can get.

17:54.541 --> 17:56.276
Anchor, do I have approval
on that?

17:56.309 --> 17:58.211
Permission granted.
Sergeants Cho and Harris

17:58.245 --> 17:59.612
will hold perimeter
if she's able.

17:59.646 --> 18:01.648
Yes, sir.

18:01.681 --> 18:05.485
Before we go down, let's lose
the, uh, Martian helmets.

18:05.518 --> 18:06.719
Let's get them earpieces.

18:10.757 --> 18:13.393
All right, rotor-heads.
You ready?

18:15.628 --> 18:17.264
Let's go get it done.

18:18.498 --> 18:19.832
Sir, are you sure

18:19.866 --> 18:22.202
that we should be
sending pilots in there?

18:22.235 --> 18:23.336
Captain Gallo and Ms. Madani

18:23.370 --> 18:24.604
have training
in ground operations,

18:24.637 --> 18:25.805
like all our pilots do.

18:27.407 --> 18:29.376
Hey.

18:29.409 --> 18:30.877
She's gonna be fine.

18:36.916 --> 18:38.751
I got to take this.

18:40.787 --> 18:42.489
Mom. I've been trying
to reach you.

18:42.522 --> 18:43.890
SIMONE:
I've just seen Tucker Magnus.

18:43.923 --> 18:46.759
I'm introducing his speech,
you know.

18:46.793 --> 18:47.794
And he's filled me in.

18:47.827 --> 18:49.229
PORTER:
I don't want you there.

18:49.262 --> 18:50.930
Look, they haven't found
the uranium,

18:50.963 --> 18:52.665
and for all we know,
there could be an accomplice.

18:52.699 --> 18:54.667
SIMONE:
Security is extensive here.

18:54.701 --> 18:57.370
If anyone tries to get in,
he will be stopped.

18:57.404 --> 18:58.871
Mom.

18:58.905 --> 19:00.507
You remind me so much
of your father right now.

19:00.540 --> 19:02.809
I know you worry,
but I will be fine.

19:02.842 --> 19:05.745
Just...

19:05.778 --> 19:08.681
keep your eyes open. Okay?

19:08.715 --> 19:10.250
I promise I will.

19:10.283 --> 19:12.385
And we're all praying
for Sergeant Kam.

19:12.419 --> 19:14.587
Get him home safe.

19:40.980 --> 19:42.549
COOGAN:
Alpha Team's in the bunker

19:42.582 --> 19:44.284
and we're Oscar Mike.

19:44.317 --> 19:47.520
HASKINS:
On the move. Roger that.

19:49.522 --> 19:51.424
They must have a backup genny.

19:55.728 --> 19:58.431
CAG:
Room clear.

19:58.465 --> 20:00.467
When was the last time you
did any kind of ground op?

20:00.500 --> 20:02.535
GALLO:
A few years. You?

20:02.569 --> 20:03.903
More than a few.

20:03.936 --> 20:05.405
I got your six.
Don't worry.

20:05.438 --> 20:06.873
I didn't say I was worried.

20:06.906 --> 20:08.508
Touché.

20:14.681 --> 20:18.017
Ma'am... I have a really
bad feeling about this.

20:18.050 --> 20:20.753
Not only did we not
find the uranium,

20:20.787 --> 20:23.690
but that bomb in the apartment
was less than half-finished.

20:23.723 --> 20:25.492
The conference is
this afternoon.

20:25.525 --> 20:27.427
You really think that he could
have finished it in time?

20:27.460 --> 20:28.995
You think it's not
the one we're looking for?

20:29.028 --> 20:30.763
The dirty bomb could
already be finished,

20:30.797 --> 20:32.465
out there somewhere
with someone else.

20:32.499 --> 20:34.867
Yeah, the FBI is on it.

20:34.901 --> 20:37.770
My father died
in a terror attack,

20:37.804 --> 20:40.573
and my mom told me he had
a bad feeling that day,

20:40.607 --> 20:42.442
but he went to work anyway.

20:42.475 --> 20:44.811
I cannot lose someone else.

20:47.347 --> 20:49.516
I'll talk to Perez.

20:49.549 --> 20:51.984
Make sure he's tracking down
every possible lead.

21:05.732 --> 21:07.266
Come on.

21:18.745 --> 21:21.348
Wait a minute.
Come on.

21:21.381 --> 21:23.350
Come on, come on!

21:34.827 --> 21:36.429
COOGAN:
We're taking fire!

22:06.593 --> 22:07.594
AGENT ANDREW:
Grenade!

22:18.771 --> 22:22.509
Alpha Team, do you read?
What is your status?

22:39.125 --> 22:40.727
He's dead.

22:42.729 --> 22:44.897
COOGAN:
We lost Officer Ben.

22:44.931 --> 22:48.100
All others are accounted for...

22:48.134 --> 22:49.902
except, damn it...

22:49.936 --> 22:51.438
Gallo! Madani!

22:58.144 --> 22:59.111
COOGAN :
Gallo!

23:00.547 --> 23:01.514
Madani!

23:01.548 --> 23:04.851
Tunnel's collapsed.

23:04.884 --> 23:06.753
Are you okay?

23:06.786 --> 23:09.789
Yeah. You?

23:09.822 --> 23:12.492
We're okay, but we're trapped.

23:12.525 --> 23:14.160
What do you guys see back there?

23:16.596 --> 23:18.130
MADANI:
It just keeps going.

23:18.164 --> 23:20.166
COOGAN:
Okay, look, we gotta move.

23:20.199 --> 23:22.001
You should, too.
Look for Jimmy,

23:22.034 --> 23:23.169
Khalid, and a way out.

23:23.202 --> 23:25.905
Roger that.

23:25.938 --> 23:28.575
Well, we're on our own,
Madani.

23:29.742 --> 23:31.444
Once again.

23:31.478 --> 23:33.045
Let's go.

23:36.549 --> 23:38.918
Hey, I need you
to stay with him.

23:38.951 --> 23:40.419
Make sure...
I got it.

23:41.988 --> 23:43.623
When Bravo Team
gets here,

23:43.656 --> 23:44.891
they're gonna help
bring him out.

23:44.924 --> 23:46.593
After that, I need you
to go topside.

23:46.626 --> 23:47.660
Need you to help
with security, all right?

23:47.694 --> 23:48.961
All right.

23:48.995 --> 23:50.763
I'm sorry.

23:50.797 --> 23:52.732
Let's go!

24:04.076 --> 24:06.613
Anchor Zero-Six, this is Cho.

24:06.646 --> 24:09.181
We have Bravo Team approaching.

24:09.215 --> 24:11.050
How was it out there?

24:11.083 --> 24:12.752
Seemed pretty quiet on radio.

24:12.785 --> 24:14.654
It was, ma'am.
No trouble to be seen.

24:14.687 --> 24:16.656
Okay.

24:26.866 --> 24:29.101
Anchor Zero-Six,

24:29.135 --> 24:31.671
can you take a look at
reaper drone footage of our hit?

24:31.704 --> 24:34.507
We need to figure out
what got us.

24:34.541 --> 24:35.875
Pulling it up now.
Stand by.

24:37.109 --> 24:38.811
Hey, I just talked
to the FBI.

24:38.845 --> 24:41.113
They found a phone
in the bomber's apartment.

24:41.147 --> 24:42.682
It called one number,
a burner.

24:42.715 --> 24:44.551
Could be our
accomplice's phone.

24:44.584 --> 24:46.686
It was off, but they were able
to triangulate its location.

24:46.719 --> 24:48.521
A park, downtown Atlanta.

24:48.555 --> 24:51.123
The conference is
happening downtown.

24:59.632 --> 25:01.568
Yeah,

25:01.601 --> 25:03.135
my radio's out of range.

25:03.169 --> 25:04.671
Yeah, mine's out, too.

25:04.704 --> 25:06.739
We really are on our own.

25:13.212 --> 25:14.714
Just a lightbulb.

25:22.889 --> 25:24.090
Jimmy?

25:24.123 --> 25:26.726
Jimmy?

25:26.759 --> 25:27.727
Let's keep moving.

25:27.760 --> 25:29.962
Okay.

25:34.801 --> 25:36.669
Found the phone
in the trash can.

25:36.703 --> 25:38.170
We need to know who tossed it.

25:38.204 --> 25:39.806
Were there any security
cameras in the area?

25:41.608 --> 25:42.875
It's a downtown location.

25:42.909 --> 25:44.076
There's got to be one

25:44.110 --> 25:45.578
with an angle
on that trash can.

25:48.815 --> 25:50.950
I'm betting that camera
has one.

25:50.983 --> 25:53.085
Pull the footage
and start looking.

26:03.162 --> 26:04.363
Cover!

26:04.396 --> 26:06.332
Think I saw something
over there.

26:08.034 --> 26:09.335
You think?

26:12.739 --> 26:15.307
Guess I was wrong.
Let's go.

26:24.350 --> 26:25.685
Gallo!

26:28.420 --> 26:29.622
Gallo!

26:36.328 --> 26:41.701
Gallo. Leland Gallo!

26:41.734 --> 26:44.603
I hate that name.

26:47.073 --> 26:49.942
He got you on the shoulder.
Yeah.

26:49.976 --> 26:51.944
The other two hit
the body armor.
Oh...

26:51.978 --> 26:54.213
Lucky me.

26:54.246 --> 26:55.915
You saved my life.

26:57.984 --> 27:00.419
You would have done
the same for me.

27:00.452 --> 27:02.789
Hell, you already have.

27:02.822 --> 27:04.691
I guess this makes us
even, then.

27:04.724 --> 27:07.126
You're bleeding a lot.
Let me see.

27:07.159 --> 27:09.628
It feels good.

27:11.764 --> 27:14.266
All right, what did I miss?
Alpha and Bravo Teams

27:14.300 --> 27:15.301
are clearing the bunker.

27:15.334 --> 27:17.103
Madani and Gallo
got separated.

27:17.136 --> 27:18.304
Their radios went
out of range.

27:18.337 --> 27:19.839
We still haven't found
Jimmy or Khalid,

27:19.872 --> 27:21.774
and we are running
out of time here.

27:21.808 --> 27:23.642
We don't get another chance
after this!

27:28.014 --> 27:29.315
Did you find anything
on the phone?

27:29.348 --> 27:31.718
Yeah, we took the footage
from the bank cameras,

27:31.751 --> 27:33.052
found who dumped it.

27:33.085 --> 27:34.721
Techs are pulling
what they can,

27:34.754 --> 27:36.122
enhancing the image,
running facial recognition,

27:36.155 --> 27:37.223
trying to I.D. her.

27:41.293 --> 27:43.029
I know this woman.

27:44.496 --> 27:45.464
That's Olivia Benning.

27:45.497 --> 27:48.000
What's going on now?

27:48.034 --> 27:50.136
We found the bomber,
and I know her.

27:50.169 --> 27:52.271
Porter and I need to
get on this right away.

27:52.304 --> 27:53.906
Go.

27:53.940 --> 27:55.808
We've got it covered here.

27:56.976 --> 27:59.111
Why would she do this?

28:05.785 --> 28:07.820
(gunfire and
man speaking Arabic on radio)

28:41.387 --> 28:43.022
Faduma.

28:53.465 --> 28:55.968
A CIA drone.

28:56.002 --> 28:59.138
Hunting for a so-called
insurgent...

28:59.171 --> 29:01.273
who was not even here!

29:01.307 --> 29:03.442
Instead, they killed
dozens of innocent people.

29:03.475 --> 29:06.378
KHALID:
It is what America does.

29:06.412 --> 29:07.980
The cost of war.

29:08.014 --> 29:09.248
I've tried for years
to make people see

29:09.281 --> 29:12.985
this country needs aid,
not violence.

29:13.019 --> 29:16.522
But violence is all
Americans can understand.

29:16.555 --> 29:20.827
They have hurt me, too,
as they have hurt you.

29:20.860 --> 29:22.829
And the man
who ordered this strike

29:22.862 --> 29:25.364
is the same one behind
all that I have endured.

29:25.397 --> 29:28.835
He gave me this as a marker
of our agreement,

29:28.868 --> 29:30.870
like it was all
some kind of game.

29:32.438 --> 29:35.374
Why am I here?
What do you want from me?

29:35.407 --> 29:37.143
I want revenge.

29:37.176 --> 29:41.881
And someone like you
can help me get it.

29:41.914 --> 29:44.316
We must hurt them
as they've hurt us.

29:45.885 --> 29:48.387
If we don't,
they will never stop.

29:57.897 --> 30:00.266
Why'd you do that, huh?

30:00.299 --> 30:01.567
Jump in front of him?

30:01.600 --> 30:03.569
I had the shot.
I would have been fine.

30:03.602 --> 30:06.272
You know why.

30:06.305 --> 30:07.306
It's you.

30:10.142 --> 30:12.544
This is exactly why we
can't blur those lines.

30:12.578 --> 30:14.480
Hold still.

30:16.348 --> 30:18.250
You think
it could ever work?

30:18.284 --> 30:20.152
Us?

30:20.186 --> 30:24.156
I mean, you know, when we had
time to actually make plans.

30:24.190 --> 30:27.293
One of us would have
to quit the unit.

30:27.326 --> 30:32.064
Yeah.
That's a tough pill to swallow.

30:32.098 --> 30:35.301
I have no idea what I want.

30:35.334 --> 30:37.169
I don't think you do either.

30:37.203 --> 30:39.171
Yeah, you see right through me,
Madani.

30:39.205 --> 30:41.140
Every time.

30:41.173 --> 30:44.143
All right, cowboy,
let's keep moving.

30:56.122 --> 30:57.957
Hey, hold up.

30:57.990 --> 31:00.893
I saw something on that wall,
over there.

31:00.927 --> 31:02.494
Before dude-guy started firing.

31:06.498 --> 31:08.300
Security camera.
We follow that wire,

31:08.334 --> 31:10.436
find where
it's feeding to.

31:10.469 --> 31:11.503
Maybe it'll help us find Jimmy.

31:36.395 --> 31:38.064
Can I help you?
Oh, my God, yes.

31:38.097 --> 31:39.665
I'm with the catering company.
I'm so late.

31:39.698 --> 31:41.267
You got to go around front,
through the metal detectors.

31:41.300 --> 31:42.701
Have you see those lines?

31:42.734 --> 31:45.304
I'll lose my job
if I don't get in there now.

31:45.337 --> 31:47.406
My manager, Brant, do you
know him? He's gonna fire me.

31:47.439 --> 31:49.208
Joanna!

31:49.241 --> 31:50.376
Get your ass in here.

31:50.409 --> 31:52.111
We're 20 behind
on hot plates!

31:52.144 --> 31:53.145
Brant?

31:53.179 --> 31:54.446
Yeah.

31:56.448 --> 31:57.716
Let me see your I.D.

31:57.749 --> 31:59.986
BRANT:
She should be on there.

32:00.019 --> 32:01.387
I gave her name
to security.

32:15.167 --> 32:16.969
Bag.

32:24.110 --> 32:25.644
Oh, actually,
I could use a little of that.

32:25.677 --> 32:26.979
Ran all the way here.

32:32.318 --> 32:34.253
What's this?
Makeup.

32:37.156 --> 32:39.558
Okay, go.

32:39.591 --> 32:41.193
Thanks.

33:55.834 --> 33:57.203
Cover me?

33:57.236 --> 33:58.237
Yeah.

34:01.207 --> 34:03.075
Bingo.

34:03.109 --> 34:05.577
-Ah.

34:05.611 --> 34:06.812
I think we're back in range.

34:06.845 --> 34:09.281
Anchor Zero-Six,
this is Gallo.

34:09.315 --> 34:10.782
Took an extremity shot,

34:10.816 --> 34:12.251
a little ways back,
but we're both fine.

34:15.354 --> 34:16.355
I've got Khalid.

34:16.388 --> 34:19.191
All these tunnels look the same.

34:19.225 --> 34:20.226
Where is that?

34:20.259 --> 34:22.761
There's a lightbulb missing.

34:22.794 --> 34:24.530
That's the tunnel
we went through before.

34:24.563 --> 34:26.132
He's going in through
the locked door.
Anchor,

34:26.165 --> 34:27.699
we have a fix on
Khalid's location.

34:27.733 --> 34:29.401
In pursuit.

34:32.738 --> 34:34.673
PORTER:
Her name...

34:34.706 --> 34:37.209
is Olivia Benning. Details
and photos are on the way.

34:37.243 --> 34:38.477
In the meantime,
sweep the area.

34:38.510 --> 34:40.179
Yeah, yes!

34:40.212 --> 34:42.214
Yes, again.

34:44.783 --> 34:45.884
Hey, we're gonna
get her, okay?

34:45.917 --> 34:47.719
Everyone knows what's going on,
they're looking for her.

34:47.753 --> 34:49.221
No, not everyone.

34:49.255 --> 34:51.390
My mother isn't
answering her phone.

34:51.423 --> 34:52.591
Porter...

34:52.624 --> 34:55.494
I know Olivia.

34:55.527 --> 34:57.196
How could I have missed this?

34:57.229 --> 34:58.764
Okay, not to rob you of
the spotlight right now,

34:58.797 --> 35:00.166
but this is on all of us.

35:00.199 --> 35:01.099
This is on me,

35:01.133 --> 35:02.334
this is on Magnus,
this is on the Agency.

35:02.368 --> 35:04.736
Still, reading people
is my job.

35:04.770 --> 35:06.905
You are not a
superhero, Porter.

35:06.938 --> 35:08.774
You're just a guy.

35:08.807 --> 35:10.476
You're one of the good ones.

35:35.367 --> 35:37.569
You ready?

35:47.713 --> 35:49.248
Drop your weapon!

35:49.281 --> 35:51.417
Do it now!
You, too.

35:51.450 --> 35:52.818
Or I will pull
this trigger.

35:52.851 --> 35:53.885
GALLO:
You do that,

35:53.919 --> 35:55.254
you're dead a second later.

35:55.287 --> 35:57.389
But you lower your gun,

35:57.423 --> 35:58.557
you tell us where Jimmy Kam is,

35:58.590 --> 36:01.260
we'll take you in unharmed.

36:01.293 --> 36:03.829
Why should I trust you?

36:03.862 --> 36:06.665
All your country has done
is betray me.

36:06.698 --> 36:08.300
Because the only other option
means you die.

36:08.334 --> 36:09.368
KHALID:
Perhaps...

36:09.401 --> 36:11.237
I do not care anymore.

36:11.270 --> 36:12.338
GALLO:
If that were true,

36:12.371 --> 36:13.705
you would've fired already.

36:15.474 --> 36:19.311
She will drop her weapon
and let me pass.

36:19.345 --> 36:21.647
That is the only way forward.

36:24.416 --> 36:26.318
All right.

36:28.287 --> 36:30.522
Nora, don't.
Don't worry.

36:31.823 --> 36:33.792
I got your six.

36:39.865 --> 36:40.966
Jimmy!

36:43.469 --> 36:45.271
He's dead.
He's dead.

36:48.407 --> 36:50.442
Hey.

36:50.476 --> 36:51.577
You okay?

36:53.912 --> 36:55.481
Yeah.

36:58.950 --> 37:01.253
It is good to see you, soldier.

37:01.287 --> 37:02.921
You, too.

37:02.954 --> 37:04.556
Yeah.

37:04.590 --> 37:05.557
Thank you.

37:05.591 --> 37:07.793
Thank you.

37:07.826 --> 37:11.363
Thank you.
Thank you for saving us.

37:13.899 --> 37:16.234
Okay, okay, let's
get you out of these.

37:19.037 --> 37:21.740
Anchor Zero-Six,
this is Madani.

37:21.773 --> 37:26.011
Khalid is dead...
and we have Jimmy.

37:26.044 --> 37:28.314
Hooah!

37:30.849 --> 37:32.484
Damn rotor-heads.

37:32.518 --> 37:35.487
Well done.
Well done.

37:35.521 --> 37:37.589
HASKINS: All right, now let's
get you all out of there.

37:37.623 --> 37:38.857
Anchor Zero-Six,
any luck with the footage

37:38.890 --> 37:40.426
of that tail rotor hit?

37:40.459 --> 37:41.593
ARMY TECHNICIAN:
We checked it out, ma'am,

37:41.627 --> 37:43.362
but no hostile to be seen.

37:43.395 --> 37:44.930
Yeah, that's what I thought.

37:57.042 --> 37:58.344
Colonel, you have a moment?

37:58.377 --> 37:59.511
Is this critical, Sergeant?

37:59.545 --> 38:00.512
Maybe.

38:00.546 --> 38:03.048
The way the tail rotor's
damaged,

38:03.081 --> 38:05.451
it looks to me like
we weren't hit by something.

38:05.484 --> 38:06.785
It blew from the inside.

38:08.086 --> 38:09.655
I'm gonna go sweep
the perimeter,

38:09.688 --> 38:11.690
get us prepped
for the exfil.

38:19.631 --> 38:21.567
Ah.

38:22.768 --> 38:24.936
Let's move.
I'm ready to see the sky.

38:24.970 --> 38:26.572
Sky may be
a little ways off still.

38:26.605 --> 38:29.608
There was a grenade,
tunnel collapsed,

38:29.641 --> 38:30.742
cut us off
from the others.

38:30.776 --> 38:31.843
JIMMY:
I was wondering why

38:31.877 --> 38:34.746
my rescue team was just
a couple of taxi drivers.

38:34.780 --> 38:36.948
Yeah.
We got to find
another way out.

38:36.982 --> 38:39.017
We don't know how many guys
Khalid still has out there.

38:39.050 --> 38:42.020
Here. You're gonna need this.

38:45.924 --> 38:47.359
Come on.

38:47.393 --> 38:48.727
I got a family to get back to.

39:03.609 --> 39:05.377
The charge on the tail rotor
went off as planned,

39:05.411 --> 39:06.612
but the pilots survived.

39:06.645 --> 39:08.947
They're trying to find their way
out of the bunker right now.

39:08.980 --> 39:10.015
Should I finish it?

39:12.918 --> 39:15.020
Yes, and make it look clean.

39:17.022 --> 39:18.824
Sir? They're
ready for you.

39:18.857 --> 39:19.991
Outstanding.
SIMONE:
Ladies and gentlemen,

39:20.025 --> 39:21.192
let me introduce you to

39:21.226 --> 39:24.896
the Director of the CIA's
Special Activities Division...

39:24.930 --> 39:28.434
KHALID:
The man who started all this...

39:29.701 --> 39:31.870
...his name is Tucker Magnus.

39:47.118 --> 39:50.689
Thank you. Thank you.
