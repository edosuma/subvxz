WEBVTT

00:05.080 --> 00:07.000
It seems as though
we're rich Mrs. West.

00:07.120 --> 00:08.960
You and me, driving
up the California

00:09.080 --> 00:10.400
Coast to San Francisco.

00:10.520 --> 00:11.560
Can we trust you?

00:11.680 --> 00:13.000
You've never asked
me that before.

00:13.120 --> 00:16.040
Yeah, well, you're
a prick this time.

00:16.160 --> 00:16.960
Ah.

00:17.080 --> 00:17.840
Ah.

00:17.960 --> 00:19.000
I'll give you Ted West.

00:19.120 --> 00:20.640
Let's drink
champagne to celebrate.

00:20.760 --> 00:21.720
You are coming on
a ride with me.

00:21.840 --> 00:23.040
I won't be here
when you get home.

00:23.160 --> 00:23.960
[laughs]

00:24.080 --> 00:25.400
I've met someone.

00:25.520 --> 00:26.760
I'll help you unpack.

00:26.880 --> 00:28.440
I don't want anything
linking me to this job.

00:28.560 --> 00:29.680
Something you want
to tell me this.

00:29.800 --> 00:31.280
You used me.

00:31.400 --> 00:33.200
Like you use everyone elsearound you to get what you.

00:33.320 --> 00:36.960
You are part of this familywhether you like it or not.

00:37.080 --> 00:39.400
I've got to be my ownfucking man not this thing

00:39.520 --> 00:40.320
you want me to be.

01:02.200 --> 01:03.080
Keep the change, mate.

01:03.200 --> 01:03.960
Thanks.

01:07.360 --> 01:09.880
You smell that?

01:10.000 --> 01:12.160
[inaudible] another market.

01:12.280 --> 01:14.240
If you say so.

01:18.680 --> 01:22.600
Oh, good god.

01:22.720 --> 01:24.760
Have we been burgled?

01:24.880 --> 01:26.040
Sparky?

01:26.160 --> 01:27.560
Bloody, scumbag,
piece of shit, thieves.

01:27.680 --> 01:28.920
Sparky?

01:29.040 --> 01:31.000
I told you we shouldn't
have left him in charge.

01:35.920 --> 01:38.480
Hey, Goldie Locks,
party is over.

01:38.600 --> 01:39.360
[hisses]

01:39.480 --> 01:41.520
Who the fuck--

01:41.640 --> 01:43.440
Jesus.

01:43.560 --> 01:44.840
Ted.

01:44.960 --> 01:46.800
Fuck.

01:46.920 --> 01:47.960
- Hey.- Why didn't you stop her?

01:48.080 --> 01:49.560
She was too bloody fast.

01:49.680 --> 01:51.400
Surprising what with allmy jewelry weighing her down.

01:51.520 --> 01:53.360
Oh, no.

01:53.480 --> 01:55.320
Hey.

01:55.440 --> 01:56.520
Fuck.

01:56.640 --> 01:57.840
I don't know who
that little bitch is,

01:57.960 --> 01:59.560
but she is going to
fucking suffer for this.

01:59.680 --> 02:07.080
[phone ringing]

02:07.200 --> 02:08.960
Yep.

02:09.080 --> 02:10.840
Hello, Wolf.

02:10.960 --> 02:13.560
Hello, Mum.

02:13.680 --> 02:15.200
You're home are you?

02:15.320 --> 02:17.960
I wouldn't be calling fromAmerica, cost an arm and a leg.

02:18.080 --> 02:19.440
Oh, but you're rich now.

02:19.560 --> 02:23.520
You want the resultsto that to have with you.

02:23.640 --> 02:24.760
What about you?

02:24.880 --> 02:27.640
Still working for Evan Lace?

02:27.760 --> 02:28.560
Yep.

02:32.120 --> 02:35.280
OK, well, welcome home.

02:35.400 --> 02:37.160
I'm actually
looking for Sparky.

02:37.280 --> 02:38.920
Have you seen him?

02:39.040 --> 02:40.840
Yeah, he's here.

02:40.960 --> 02:42.760
Hey, you're back.

02:42.880 --> 02:44.040
Did you go to Disneyland?

02:44.160 --> 02:45.040
Yes.

02:45.160 --> 02:46.600
We went to bloody Disneyland.

02:46.720 --> 02:49.080
Sparky, did you understandwhat we meant when we asked

02:49.200 --> 02:50.320
you to look after the house?

02:50.440 --> 02:51.640
Yes.

02:51.760 --> 02:54.800
So how come when we get
back, you're not here?

02:54.920 --> 02:57.920
I came to a party
at Wolf's place.

02:58.040 --> 02:58.800
When?

02:58.920 --> 03:02.440
A couple weeks ago.

03:02.560 --> 03:03.360
I locked up.

03:03.480 --> 03:04.800
I'm pretty sure.

03:04.920 --> 03:06.240
Why?

03:06.360 --> 03:08.240
Well, I think you needto see that for yourself.

03:08.360 --> 03:09.360
Get over here now.

03:09.480 --> 03:12.040
It wasn't like
this when I left.

03:12.160 --> 03:13.320
And what about the girl?

03:13.440 --> 03:14.520
I don't know any girls.

03:14.640 --> 03:15.560
Yeah, that's definitely true.

03:15.680 --> 03:17.200
Wolf then.

03:17.320 --> 03:20.600
Wolf hasn't been
here since you left.

03:20.720 --> 03:23.000
I'm sure it's not personal.

03:23.120 --> 03:24.600
It's a bloody good flat.

03:24.720 --> 03:26.480
And I've met a beautifulwoman in the inner city slums.

03:26.600 --> 03:29.560
One day she'll be the
future Mrs. Faladin.

03:29.680 --> 03:31.040
But getting back to
the troubles here.

03:31.160 --> 03:34.080
So who the hell
was the slag making

03:34.200 --> 03:36.040
herself at home in my bed?

03:36.160 --> 03:37.320
Probably just some street kid.

03:37.440 --> 03:39.520
Street kid with
bloody nice jewelry now.

03:39.640 --> 03:41.200
I'll get you new jewels.

03:41.320 --> 03:42.320
We are the hoi
poloi now remember.

03:42.440 --> 03:44.000
And did the hoi
poloi buy any gifts

03:44.120 --> 03:45.200
while they were in America?

03:45.320 --> 03:46.920
You think you deserve gifts?

03:47.040 --> 03:49.240
Well, this was
all Sparky's fault.

03:49.360 --> 03:53.520
Oh, so Sparky was partying allby himself was he at your flat?

03:53.640 --> 03:59.280
Sometimes yes, it
was very disturbing.

03:59.400 --> 04:00.960
Tidy first.

04:01.080 --> 04:01.960
Then presents.

04:02.080 --> 04:03.040
I'd understand
if I missed out.

04:03.160 --> 04:05.000
Sparky, just bloody tidy.

04:18.200 --> 04:21.520
Did you hear that the
lovely Christian family

04:21.640 --> 04:23.720
across the road decided
that the neighborhood

04:23.840 --> 04:25.600
wasn't for them after all?

04:25.720 --> 04:26.800
Yeah, what a shame.

04:26.920 --> 04:29.120
Yeah, too many bad elements.

04:29.240 --> 04:31.400
All night parties.

04:31.520 --> 04:34.360
My real estate agent friendalluded me to their plight,

04:34.480 --> 04:39.240
and I was forced,
forced to take it off

04:39.360 --> 04:41.240
their hands at a
ridiculously low price.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.440
The old lady in the
bungalow next door,

04:46.560 --> 04:49.360
however, she's not budging.

04:49.480 --> 04:51.520
I'm working on it.

04:51.640 --> 04:54.040
Maybe you should have
another party tonight.

04:54.160 --> 04:55.960
My life is one
big party, Evan.

04:56.080 --> 04:56.840
Oh, yeah.

04:56.960 --> 04:58.080
Tough job.

04:58.200 --> 04:59.400
You know if there's
any other work you

04:59.520 --> 05:00.400
want me to do I could do it.- No, no, no.

05:00.520 --> 05:01.640
Just the bad elements.

05:01.760 --> 05:02.680
That's what I need you for now.

05:07.120 --> 05:07.920
Wicked.

05:10.520 --> 05:11.280
Wendy.

05:13.960 --> 05:15.920
Are you still doing thatneighborhood watch carry on?

05:16.040 --> 05:17.360
Yes.

05:17.480 --> 05:18.720
Yes, but we have plentyof members at the moment.

05:18.840 --> 05:20.080
So don't feel as though
you need to be a part--

05:20.200 --> 05:21.080
Did you see anything
going on at our place

05:21.200 --> 05:22.040
while we were overseas.

05:22.160 --> 05:23.520
Nothing out of the ordinary.

05:23.640 --> 05:25.600
We've just got back
after a few months away.

05:25.720 --> 05:27.880
And our house has been
burgled and vandalized.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.800
My goodness, that's a shame.

05:29.920 --> 05:33.040
Did you and your watchiepeople see anything?

05:33.160 --> 05:33.920
No.

05:34.040 --> 05:35.480
Apart from him.

05:35.600 --> 05:37.840
And then there was that gangof girls who had staying.

05:37.960 --> 05:39.280
A gang?

05:39.400 --> 05:43.280
Ugh, maybe moved
in four weeks ago.

05:43.400 --> 05:45.680
How many in this gang?

05:45.800 --> 05:47.160
A few.
They had parties.

05:47.280 --> 05:48.360
What did they look like?

05:48.480 --> 05:50.480
Well, they were
rough, obviously.

05:50.600 --> 05:54.400
Foul mouthed, tarty, teenagers,glue sniffers [inaudible]..

05:54.520 --> 05:57.240
And you didn't think
to tell the police?

05:57.360 --> 06:01.080
Well, we assumed they
were friends of yours.

06:01.200 --> 06:02.720
Well, Mum, we'll get
to the bottom of it.

06:02.840 --> 06:03.640
Thanks, Wendy.

06:03.760 --> 06:05.320
Anytime.

06:05.440 --> 06:07.560
Well, look who's back.

06:07.680 --> 06:08.960
You're looking flash.

06:09.080 --> 06:11.400
A bit of shopping
in Los Angeles.

06:11.520 --> 06:12.880
Um, very nice.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.200
Husband quite busy.

06:14.320 --> 06:16.400
What with Christmas
and summer and so on.

06:16.520 --> 06:19.000
It was winter where you
were though, I suppose.

06:19.120 --> 06:20.400
Their winter is
like our summer.

06:20.520 --> 06:21.840
Of course it is.

06:21.960 --> 06:23.280
What the fuck is that?

06:23.400 --> 06:24.440
Oh, it's lovely, isn't it?

06:24.560 --> 06:25.600
You've got one
similar, don't you?

06:25.720 --> 06:26.480
I did.

06:26.600 --> 06:29.320
Until it was nicked.

06:29.440 --> 06:30.600
Along with that and that.

06:30.720 --> 06:32.280
Are you sure?

06:32.400 --> 06:34.640
I mean they look like yours butyours aren't exactly uncommon.

06:34.760 --> 06:36.520
We were broken into
while we were away.

06:39.240 --> 06:42.920
There's my bloody stereo.

06:43.040 --> 06:44.280
Who brought this stuff in?- Some young girls.

06:44.400 --> 06:45.560
They said their
grandmother had died.

06:45.680 --> 06:46.840
You didn't think
to check their story?

06:46.960 --> 06:48.240
We don't ask questions
in this business.

06:48.360 --> 06:51.320
I want back my own stuff.

06:51.440 --> 06:53.600
Well, it's not as if
you can't afford it.

06:53.720 --> 06:56.440
You're all rolling in
it now, aren't you?

06:56.560 --> 06:58.400
No idea what
you're talking about.

06:58.520 --> 06:59.400
Oh, yes.

06:59.520 --> 07:01.960
The game we play now.

07:02.080 --> 07:04.880
All the shit I took
from Lefty for 20 years.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.240
And the day I finally get upthe guts to leave the bastard,

07:07.360 --> 07:09.440
he goes and pulls the
biggest job of his life.

07:09.560 --> 07:10.720
Still no idea.

07:10.840 --> 07:11.600
Yeah, yeah.

07:16.360 --> 07:18.120
Have you heard from him at all.

07:18.240 --> 07:19.480
No.

07:19.600 --> 07:20.840
I keep waiting for him
to show up, for all hell

07:20.960 --> 07:23.040
to break loose, but nothing.

07:43.320 --> 07:47.120
Uncle Mike, wait for me.

07:47.240 --> 07:48.600
Come on, slow poke.

07:54.160 --> 07:55.440
Right oh, that's me.
I might head off.

07:55.560 --> 07:56.560
Where to, love?

07:56.680 --> 07:58.280
You could catch
up with Phineas.

07:58.400 --> 07:59.520
He'll be at the golf course.

07:59.640 --> 08:00.440
The what?

08:00.560 --> 08:02.360
The Whytechery Golf Club.

08:02.480 --> 08:03.480
He's taking up golf.

08:03.600 --> 08:05.640
[laughs]

08:05.760 --> 08:07.120
He's a rich man of leisure.

08:07.240 --> 08:09.720
So he thought he'd do whatrich men of leisure do.

08:09.840 --> 08:11.880
Well, I'll remind himthat only wankers play golf.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.920
He absolutely loves it.

08:14.040 --> 08:15.400
He's always buying
new golf sticks.

08:18.040 --> 08:18.800
Gin?

08:18.920 --> 08:19.720
Gorgeous.

08:25.800 --> 08:27.920
Oh, fuck.

08:28.040 --> 08:31.040
Hobby is going well then?

08:31.160 --> 08:32.800
I hate golf.
It's a stupid game.

08:32.920 --> 08:33.720
Yeah.

08:33.840 --> 08:35.800
Nice slacks though.

08:35.920 --> 08:37.280
Hurry up.

08:37.400 --> 08:38.200
Up yours.

08:38.320 --> 08:39.120
Shit for brains.

08:39.240 --> 08:42.120
Sorry for that language.

08:42.240 --> 08:43.840
Welcome home.

08:43.960 --> 08:45.280
Cheers.

08:45.400 --> 08:46.560
Four.

08:46.680 --> 08:50.120
Jesus Christ, that's
fucking dangerous.

08:50.240 --> 08:52.880
Fuck off, you wankers.

08:53.000 --> 08:53.840
Go on, fuck off.

08:58.320 --> 08:59.120
Beer?

08:59.240 --> 09:01.400
Good idea.

09:01.520 --> 09:03.880
We haven't seen
much of Bert either.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.880
He's been spending all
his time with Riana.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.800
Which I found out
is Maori for Diana.

09:08.920 --> 09:10.960
Which is lovely.

09:11.080 --> 09:14.360
It's new.

09:14.480 --> 09:16.840
As for Lefty not a word.

09:16.960 --> 09:19.560
I suppose it's the
humiliation, his wife

09:19.680 --> 09:20.840
leaving him for a policeman.

09:20.960 --> 09:22.400
I was hoping he
hasn't gone AWOL

09:22.520 --> 09:23.920
with the rest of the money.- Oh, no.

09:24.040 --> 09:25.520
He'll be off licking
his wounds somewhere.

09:25.640 --> 09:27.280
Getting some bird
to lick them for him.

09:27.400 --> 09:28.920
Oh, gross me out
the door, Rita.

09:29.040 --> 09:30.880
Just put that on credit, love.Rita West.

09:31.000 --> 09:31.840
I'll have to ask, mum.

09:31.960 --> 09:33.320
Mum.
- Oh, it's OK.

09:33.440 --> 09:34.200
Ivan knows me.

09:34.320 --> 09:35.120
Who?

09:35.240 --> 09:36.280
Hello.

09:36.400 --> 09:37.480
How can I help?

09:37.600 --> 09:38.800
Is Ivan away?

09:38.920 --> 09:39.880
Oh, I'm sorry, love.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.280
He's popped his cloggs.

09:41.400 --> 09:42.680
What?

09:42.800 --> 09:44.200
His wife didn't want torun this place on her own.

09:44.320 --> 09:45.400
So she sold to us.

09:45.520 --> 09:46.880
I'm Trish Miller.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
And if I'm not here, oneof my lovely girls will be.

09:49.120 --> 09:50.120
Fair enough.

09:50.240 --> 09:52.440
Look, there's no
smoking in here.

09:52.560 --> 09:53.720
There's a sign by the door.

09:57.720 --> 09:59.120
Didn't see it.

10:03.160 --> 10:05.720
If you could just
pop that on credit.

10:05.840 --> 10:06.840
Yeah, well, sorry, love.

10:06.960 --> 10:08.920
There's no credit.

10:09.040 --> 10:12.600
You're very welcome to pay cash.

10:12.720 --> 10:13.680
No, OK.

10:13.800 --> 10:14.840
Pop that back on
the shelf, Mandy.

10:14.960 --> 10:15.840
I'll pay for it, Rita.

10:15.960 --> 10:18.640
No, you bloody won't.

10:18.760 --> 10:21.880
Do you think that
I'm not honest?

10:22.000 --> 10:23.160
No offense.

10:23.280 --> 10:24.960
But I don't know you
from a bar of soap.

10:25.080 --> 10:26.520
Well, I am offended.

10:26.640 --> 10:29.080
Because I'll have you knowI have been coming to this--

10:33.520 --> 10:34.360
you.

10:34.480 --> 10:35.520
Do I know you?

10:35.640 --> 10:36.840
This is her.

10:36.960 --> 10:39.760
This is the little tart
who broke into my house,

10:39.880 --> 10:42.160
stole my jewelry, and hawkedit off at the Galleria.

10:42.280 --> 10:43.080
Oh, my god.

10:43.200 --> 10:43.960
I beg your bloody pardon.

10:44.080 --> 10:45.080
Is this your daughter?

10:45.200 --> 10:47.280
Because she has
trashed my house.

10:47.400 --> 10:48.200
I didn't, mom.

10:48.320 --> 10:49.360
She's lying.

10:49.480 --> 10:52.080
Why the fuck
would I make it up?

10:52.200 --> 10:55.600
You're Rita West, aren't you?

10:55.720 --> 10:57.200
So.

10:57.320 --> 11:00.040
So I've heard all about youlot from Neighborhood Watch.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.560
Rita, I think
we should just go.

11:01.680 --> 11:05.520
She was in my bloody
bedroom when I got back.

11:05.640 --> 11:07.520
I saw her with my own eyes.

11:07.640 --> 11:08.440
She hissed at me.

11:08.560 --> 11:09.480
No, I didn't.

11:09.600 --> 11:10.360
That's sick.

11:10.480 --> 11:11.840
Well, I'm sorry.

11:11.960 --> 11:14.440
But you have most definitelygot the wrong person.

11:14.560 --> 11:15.560
A gang of girls.

11:18.520 --> 11:19.880
[laughs]

11:20.000 --> 11:22.240
Were you in on it too?

11:22.360 --> 11:23.640
Of course, you bloody were.

11:23.760 --> 11:25.680
You're little slappers
have been using

11:25.800 --> 11:27.000
my house as a party house.

11:27.120 --> 11:28.240
Don't you talk about
my girls like that.

11:28.360 --> 11:29.240
Stealing my stuff,
and they are going

11:29.360 --> 11:30.680
to payback every bloody cent.

11:30.800 --> 11:33.200
That's impossible becausemy girls are good girls.

11:33.320 --> 11:35.120
And they wouldn't do
anything like that.

11:35.240 --> 11:36.480
Oh, fuck me.

11:36.600 --> 11:38.400
You need to wake up and
smell the roses or what.

11:38.520 --> 11:40.200
So if you believe
otherwise, you

11:40.320 --> 11:41.600
can take it up with the police.

11:41.720 --> 11:44.360
Oh, I will be taking
it up with the police.

11:44.480 --> 11:46.240
Don't you worry about that.

11:50.240 --> 11:52.240
Are you really going totake it up with the police?

11:52.360 --> 11:53.840
Of course not.

11:53.960 --> 11:55.560
We have our own way of dealingwith these kind of people.

12:04.800 --> 12:06.080
- OK, my turn.
- OK go.

12:06.200 --> 12:07.080
[laughter]

12:07.200 --> 12:09.080
[children playing]

12:09.200 --> 12:12.080
[rock music]

12:16.200 --> 12:17.280
It's my turn now.

12:17.400 --> 12:20.240
Hey, make sure no
one nicks my car.

12:20.360 --> 12:21.840
There's 50 cents in it for you.

12:21.960 --> 12:22.960
50 cents?

12:23.080 --> 12:23.840
Cool.

12:26.560 --> 12:27.320
Here, here, here.

12:39.880 --> 12:41.400
Mrs. Rita.

12:41.520 --> 12:43.400
Jesus.

12:43.520 --> 12:46.560
What a fucking pit.

12:46.680 --> 12:51.040
Oh, but it's our
pit, and we like it.

12:51.160 --> 12:52.480
Where's Wolf?

12:52.600 --> 12:54.800
Out with the boss.

12:54.920 --> 12:56.360
A cup of tea, Mrs. West?

12:56.480 --> 12:58.480
Have you got some?

12:58.600 --> 13:00.120
Ugh, we don't.

13:00.240 --> 13:02.920
But we've got many other
beverages and stuff.

13:03.040 --> 13:04.080
I can see that.

13:10.560 --> 13:14.480
The girl who stole my jewelry,who family own the dairy,

13:14.600 --> 13:16.400
I need her and her
bitch of a mother

13:16.520 --> 13:18.280
taught that you don'tmess with The West Family.

13:18.400 --> 13:19.440
What are you going to do?

13:19.560 --> 13:20.400
No.

13:20.520 --> 13:22.200
Sparky, you were in charge.

13:22.320 --> 13:23.360
So you're going to do it.

13:23.480 --> 13:24.000
You want me to
burn the dairy down?

13:24.120 --> 13:25.320
No.

13:25.440 --> 13:26.880
I do not want you to
burn the dairy down.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.680
I need the dairy where itis because the Foursquare is

13:28.800 --> 13:29.600
too far away.

13:29.720 --> 13:30.960
Oh.

13:31.080 --> 13:32.600
I need this woman to
realize that she doesn't

13:32.720 --> 13:33.920
want to own a dairy after all.

13:34.040 --> 13:35.840
Or if she does, she
wants to own a dairy

13:35.960 --> 13:39.080
on the other side of town.

13:39.200 --> 13:41.200
Well, consider yourdairy job done Mrs. Rita.

13:41.320 --> 13:42.960
We will be honored to help.
- Good.

13:43.080 --> 13:45.120
Then tidy up in here,
I can smell mice.

13:45.240 --> 13:46.320
I like the mice.

13:46.440 --> 13:48.000
Wolf hates mice.
Get traps.

13:48.120 --> 13:49.680
But they are my friends.

13:49.800 --> 13:52.400
Sparky, cleanup, and call mewhen you've sorted the dairy.

13:59.120 --> 13:59.880
Here you go.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.960
Thanks.

14:02.080 --> 14:02.960
Thanks, lady.

14:03.080 --> 14:03.880
Thanks, lady.

14:18.360 --> 14:19.280
I need a room.

14:19.400 --> 14:20.640
Plenty of space.

14:20.760 --> 14:23.480
But the best part is we
don't got no land lord.

14:23.600 --> 14:24.840
Nice.

14:24.960 --> 14:30.080
Got a mortgage with the
bank, only 10% interest.

14:30.200 --> 14:31.040
Welcome home, Ted.

14:31.160 --> 14:32.000
Mate.

14:32.120 --> 14:34.680
Chow, dad, how was America?

14:34.800 --> 14:37.200
Uh, yeah, good time.

14:37.320 --> 14:38.360
How's Rita?

14:38.480 --> 14:39.400
Uh, good.

14:39.520 --> 14:40.320
Good.

14:40.440 --> 14:41.520
Is she here?

14:41.640 --> 14:44.000
No, no, she isn't.

14:44.120 --> 14:46.760
This is kind of a gang
meeting for the gang.

14:46.880 --> 14:47.840
Yeah.

14:47.960 --> 14:48.760
I know.

14:52.640 --> 14:54.960
She's cool, Ted.

14:55.080 --> 14:57.080
I want my lady to be a
part of everything I do.

14:57.200 --> 14:58.200
Really?

14:58.320 --> 15:00.720
You tell Rita
everything, right?

15:00.840 --> 15:02.200
We talk.
Yes.

15:02.320 --> 15:03.080
Yes.

15:03.200 --> 15:04.720
It's the same thing.

15:04.840 --> 15:06.880
Do you have a problem withme wanting to stand by my man?

15:11.160 --> 15:14.200
Don't take it
personally, but I need

15:14.320 --> 15:16.800
to know that I can trust you.

15:16.920 --> 15:19.480
All the way.

15:19.600 --> 15:20.960
Like she said, man.

15:21.080 --> 15:22.080
Hey, I got a new [inaudible]and it's tricked out.

15:22.200 --> 15:23.120
And it's mint.

15:23.240 --> 15:24.080
- You bought a new car?
- Yeah.

15:24.200 --> 15:25.440
So?

15:25.560 --> 15:27.760
So, didn't I say not to
throw your money around?

15:27.880 --> 15:28.960
Hmm?

15:29.080 --> 15:30.400
Not to draw attention
to yourselves?

15:30.520 --> 15:32.600
Oh, you mean like bygoing on a flash holiday?

15:32.720 --> 15:37.200
No, I mean like houses,
and cars, golf, Phineas?

15:37.320 --> 15:38.760
Oh, come on, Ted.

15:38.880 --> 15:40.800
What's the point of beingloaded if we can't enjoy it?

15:40.920 --> 15:42.920
So has the meeting
actually started?

15:43.040 --> 15:46.560
Because I thought we should havethe meeting in the spa pool.

15:46.680 --> 15:48.320
You have a spa pool?

15:48.440 --> 15:50.920
Ah, this is the life, eh?

15:51.040 --> 15:53.080
Are we expecting Lefty today?

15:53.200 --> 15:55.360
Don't know.

15:55.480 --> 15:56.760
Nobody has seen him.

15:56.880 --> 15:58.360
Not since the last payout.

15:58.480 --> 16:00.200
Guess we'll catch up
with him tomorrow then.

16:00.320 --> 16:01.720
Unless he's run
off with it all.

16:01.840 --> 16:04.960
He has dropped off
the face of the planet.

16:05.080 --> 16:07.640
Well, Carol reckons
is probably hiding

16:07.760 --> 16:09.640
until he gets over the shame.

16:09.760 --> 16:11.680
Losing his wife to a pig.

16:11.800 --> 16:13.200
Is anyone worried about that?

16:13.320 --> 16:15.680
I mean she's still lookingfor your wife, right, Ted?

16:15.800 --> 16:16.880
It is a worry.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.040
You want to talk
to me about trust?

16:18.160 --> 16:20.560
Rita knows what
she's doing keeping

16:20.680 --> 16:23.200
Ngaire close and up to hereyeballs in the business.

16:23.320 --> 16:25.240
McArthy ever goes after
us, he'd be taking

16:25.360 --> 16:27.000
his missus down in the process.

16:27.120 --> 16:29.240
Not just a pretty
face is our Rita.

16:29.360 --> 16:30.600
Moving on.

16:30.720 --> 16:32.280
Time to start to thinkingabout the next job.

16:32.400 --> 16:35.240
But isn't Lefty bringingus more money tomorrow?

16:35.360 --> 16:36.280
Yes, Phinias.

16:36.400 --> 16:37.600
But after that.

16:37.720 --> 16:39.640
Then he'll bring us
more later on, right?

16:39.760 --> 16:41.360
Well, until we run out.

16:41.480 --> 16:45.320
And that won't be for ages.

16:45.440 --> 16:46.720
Oh, we got the big score, Ted.

16:46.840 --> 16:49.400
We can take a holiday for a bit.

16:49.520 --> 16:50.560
How about just
chilling out, Ted.

16:50.680 --> 16:51.480
In the spa.

16:55.240 --> 16:57.240
The only one who showed anyinterest in going back to work

16:57.360 --> 16:58.720
was bloody Riana.

16:58.840 --> 17:00.720
What the hell was
she doing there?

17:00.840 --> 17:04.480
Yeah, that's what I said.

17:04.600 --> 17:06.360
Well, Lefty will
be on my side.

17:06.480 --> 17:07.600
He's a greedy bastard.

17:07.720 --> 17:09.280
If you are sure he
will even turn up.

17:09.400 --> 17:10.560
He never let us down before.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.240
Oh, wonderful.

17:15.360 --> 17:16.600
No bloody milk.

17:16.720 --> 17:17.840
Do you want me
to go to the dairy?

17:17.960 --> 17:18.720
No.

17:18.840 --> 17:19.760
I bloody do not.

17:19.880 --> 17:22.200
Has anyone seen
my Bella Clava?

17:22.320 --> 17:24.120
Ah, piss, who spilledbeer all over the papers.

17:24.240 --> 17:25.040
Are you in, Wolf?

17:25.160 --> 17:25.960
The dairy job?

17:26.080 --> 17:26.840
No.

17:26.960 --> 17:28.360
But it's for you mum.

17:28.480 --> 17:30.320
Why are you guys
doing her dirty work?

17:30.440 --> 17:31.280
Tell her piss off.

17:31.400 --> 17:32.160
I'd never do that.

17:32.280 --> 17:33.600
Me neither.

17:33.720 --> 17:36.880
Yeah, take a brave manto tell Rita to piss off.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.360
Fine then.

17:38.480 --> 17:39.680
If you want to do somestink little dairy robbery.

17:39.800 --> 17:40.680
What?

17:40.800 --> 17:42.120
So we're doing an actual job.

17:42.240 --> 17:44.400
Hey, Evan will comethrough with something soon.

17:44.520 --> 17:45.840
And the dairy does have food.

17:45.960 --> 17:46.720
And papers.

17:46.840 --> 17:47.680
Then you go.

17:47.800 --> 17:49.960
Have fun boys.

17:50.080 --> 17:51.200
Dawn of the fucking century.

17:55.960 --> 17:58.240
[indistinct conversations]

17:58.360 --> 18:00.640
[rock music]

18:02.680 --> 18:04.800
Did Riana bring a plate?

18:04.920 --> 18:07.000
I don't think so.

18:07.120 --> 18:07.920
- How rude.
- Cheers.

18:08.040 --> 18:08.800
Cheers.

18:08.920 --> 18:10.840
Heard from Lefty?

18:10.960 --> 18:12.440
He'll be here.

18:12.560 --> 18:13.680
He'd better.

18:13.800 --> 18:15.880
Where are the kids?
Wolf and the boys?

18:16.000 --> 18:17.440
They are not coming.

18:17.560 --> 18:19.280
I've got them doing
a little job for me.

18:19.400 --> 18:20.520
Oh, lovely.

18:20.640 --> 18:22.960
Well, someone's got to work.

18:23.080 --> 18:25.280
Hey, hey, hey.

18:25.400 --> 18:26.200
People outside.

18:26.320 --> 18:27.120
What did I tell you?

18:27.240 --> 18:28.080
Here he is.

18:28.200 --> 18:30.560
Well, wonders never cease.

18:30.680 --> 18:32.920
That'll be why we
haven't seen him.

18:33.040 --> 18:34.600
A new lady.

18:34.720 --> 18:36.720
She didn't bring a plate either.

18:36.840 --> 18:38.920
This is the light
of my life, Theresa.

18:39.040 --> 18:39.880
Hey there.

Everything fell apart, Ted.

30:54.440 --> 30:56.800
My whole world.

30:56.920 --> 31:05.400
I didn't have the will tokill or even get out a bit.

31:05.520 --> 31:06.320
Nothing.

31:21.760 --> 31:22.640
You OK?

31:22.760 --> 31:24.440
Yeah, long day at work.

31:27.520 --> 31:28.320
What's wrong?

31:33.760 --> 31:36.120
I had to drop
something at Rita's.

31:36.240 --> 31:39.360
There was a party going on,and they were all there.

31:39.480 --> 31:40.600

31:40.720 --> 31:41.760
Um.

31:41.880 --> 31:43.040
I hope that bastard
left you alone.

31:43.160 --> 31:44.040
Of course, he didn't.

31:44.160 --> 31:44.920
He was a prick.

31:47.920 --> 31:49.160
But it wasn't just that.

31:52.640 --> 31:55.200
I used to be at the parties.

31:55.320 --> 31:56.880
Those people were
like family to me.

31:57.000 --> 31:57.800
Do you regret?

31:57.920 --> 31:59.000
No.

31:59.120 --> 32:00.040
No, I don't.

32:00.160 --> 32:05.640
It's just-- they

32:05.760 --> 32:11.800
overseas and dinner
at Antione's, and I'm,

32:11.920 --> 32:14.160
I'm jealous, I suppose.

32:14.280 --> 32:15.440
There's no other
way to paint it.

32:15.560 --> 32:17.560
How can the likes
of Ted and Rita West

32:17.680 --> 32:20.560
afford trips overseas
and dinner at Antroines?

32:20.680 --> 32:22.200

34:44.920 --> 34:46.400
that will shed some light.

34:46.520 --> 34:47.920
Everybody happy?

34:48.040 --> 34:49.960
I won't be happy untilthis sow gets off my property
