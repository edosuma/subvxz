00:50.022 --> 00:51.688
I'm not in the mood.

00:52.449 --> 00:54.202
Mo, something's happening.

00:54.227 --> 00:56.194
I think I'm singing out loud again.

00:56.219 --> 00:57.858
You look fine to me, other than being

00:57.883 --> 00:59.494
way too perky at 8:00 a.m.

00:59.519 --> 01:04.069
This is some crazy, messed-up,
next-level heart song stuff.

01:04.093 --> 01:05.507
Hold on, what was the name of the song?

01:05.532 --> 01:07.553
Something about a bad moon rising.

01:07.578 --> 01:09.085
I'm gonna go with "Bad Moon Rising."

01:09.110 --> 01:11.311
- That doesn't sound good.
- Mm-mm.

01:11.336 --> 01:12.741
Like a bad omen.

01:13.014 --> 01:14.356
What if it was some kind of warning?

01:14.380 --> 01:15.475
Is everything okay with you?

01:15.499 --> 01:17.545
No, not at all, but thanks for asking.

01:17.570 --> 01:19.459
- What's wrong?
- Oh, I'm in trouble, Zoey.

01:19.484 --> 01:21.959
I can't paint, I can't sew,
I can't caftan.

01:21.984 --> 01:24.100
It's like I'm in the middle
of a creative breakdown.

01:24.125 --> 01:27.693
Do you think it could maybe,
possibly, in some way...

01:27.718 --> 01:29.455
It has nothing to do with Eddie.

01:29.480 --> 01:30.524
I'm just saying.

01:30.548 --> 01:33.194
Could be depression from
your breakup with him,

01:33.219 --> 01:35.330
based on that song that I heard you sing

01:35.355 --> 01:37.234
that I don't know the
name of about your issues.

01:37.258 --> 01:38.609
- It was probably "Issues."
- You know what?

01:38.633 --> 01:40.577
I need to make sure
that everything's okay

01:40.602 --> 01:42.655
with my dad, my family.

01:42.680 --> 01:44.334
If there's a bad moon on the rise,

01:44.359 --> 01:46.405
maybe I can stop it before it's risen?

01:46.430 --> 01:48.428
Come on, buddy. Just a little bit more.

01:48.796 --> 01:50.101
Nah.

01:51.217 --> 01:53.195
Morning, Howie. Hi, Dad.

01:53.539 --> 01:55.069
How's he doing? Everything okay?

01:55.094 --> 01:58.241
- Nothing strange going on?
- No.

01:58.266 --> 02:00.378
He's actually more alert
than normal this morning.

02:00.403 --> 02:04.090
Although, he was crushing me
in gin rummy earlier.

02:04.115 --> 02:06.436
I'm pretty sure he was cheating,

02:06.461 --> 02:08.761
although I'm still not sure how.

02:15.117 --> 02:16.628
I love you, too.

02:16.653 --> 02:18.663
Want to buzz me something in Morse code?

02:18.688 --> 02:21.038
I can try to remember
back to that one week

02:21.063 --> 02:22.707
when I was a Girl Scout before realizing

02:22.732 --> 02:24.991
I actually had to go camping
and be outside and stuff?

02:27.358 --> 02:29.000
Yeah, I figured.

02:29.196 --> 02:31.438
Aah! No, no, no, no, no!

02:31.463 --> 02:32.735
Damn it!

02:32.760 --> 02:34.032
Mom?

02:34.416 --> 02:35.789
- Ahh...
- Is everything okay?

02:35.814 --> 02:38.345
Yes, I dropped
my wedding ring down there

02:38.370 --> 02:40.939
and it's so dark, I can't see to get it.

02:42.253 --> 02:44.319
Mom, wait, don't do that!

02:44.703 --> 02:47.385
Sorry. Got it.

02:47.757 --> 02:51.088
Hey, did you notice
how chipper your dad is today?

02:51.113 --> 02:53.619
Yeah, he just laughed with me.

02:53.644 --> 02:56.728
I haven't heard that laugh in a while.

02:56.753 --> 02:59.487
Yeah. It's one of the good days.

03:10.230 --> 03:13.353
Well, well, well! Look who's back.

03:13.378 --> 03:15.408
Yeah, glad to be back.

03:15.433 --> 03:17.845
Who wants to work on the
6th floor anyway? Not this guy.

03:17.870 --> 03:20.588
Especially now that we've got
our very own omelette bar.

03:21.941 --> 03:24.533
Zoey, I've had three omelettes today.

03:24.558 --> 03:25.564
Egg whites only.

03:25.589 --> 03:26.925
Gotta keep those triglycerides low

03:26.949 --> 03:28.941
when your cholesterol's sky-high, son.

03:29.310 --> 03:32.010
Are you bragging about
having high cholesterol?

03:32.035 --> 03:34.197
Top 2% for my age, you know it.

03:34.222 --> 03:36.900
Purely genetic. Now on all the statins.

03:36.925 --> 03:39.359
I am worried. This is how I compensate.

03:39.799 --> 03:44.802
Hey, so, how is Max doing?

03:46.498 --> 03:48.658
Fine, I think? Why?

03:48.683 --> 03:50.689
Oh, so you haven't even heard.

03:51.181 --> 03:53.361
Ava fired Max? Why did she do that?

03:53.386 --> 03:55.049
I don't know, I'm guessing it's not

03:55.074 --> 03:56.385
because he did too good a job.

03:56.410 --> 03:58.155
This is terrible! I feel awful for him.

03:58.180 --> 03:59.627
Yeah, me too. I'm real broken up.

03:59.652 --> 04:00.971
- Is everything okay with you?
- No!

04:00.995 --> 04:03.041
Everything is not okay.
Speaking of getting fired,

04:03.066 --> 04:04.577
I'm afraid I am getting fired.

04:04.877 --> 04:08.330
I got a voicemail from
Danny Michael Davis,

04:08.355 --> 04:10.056
a voicemail.

04:10.081 --> 04:12.057
Now I have to call him back and
I'm afraid I'm getting fired

04:12.081 --> 04:14.626
and I'm just hoping it was a
butt dial from his smart pants.

04:15.238 --> 04:17.238
What are smart pants?

04:18.058 --> 04:20.091
Uh... nothing. Never mind.

04:20.117 --> 04:21.514
Okay, um...

04:21.539 --> 04:23.866
Okay, well, this is just
a suggestion, but maybe...

04:24.328 --> 04:27.506
- don't call him back?
- Why would I do that?

04:27.531 --> 04:28.953
I think there's something
weird going on in the air today

04:28.977 --> 04:30.139
and I don't want you to get fired, too.

04:30.163 --> 04:31.600
- Me neither.
- But it's fine.

04:31.625 --> 04:32.882
Come on, you know Danny Michael Davis.

04:32.906 --> 04:34.429
He's got a million things on his plate.

04:34.453 --> 04:36.953
Don't call him back this once.
He'll forget about it for six months.

04:36.977 --> 04:38.780
And by then,
AI will probably have taken over,

04:38.805 --> 04:40.163
probably because of smart pants?

04:40.188 --> 04:41.764
Don't ask me about the smart pants.

04:41.789 --> 04:43.389
Fine, I won't call him back right away.

04:43.414 --> 04:45.147
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

04:49.742 --> 04:51.960
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I don't know, shame,

04:51.985 --> 04:54.085
embarrassment, self-loathing.

04:54.110 --> 04:56.085
We also haven't really
talked that much lately.

04:56.110 --> 04:57.773
Right. But wait till you
try a Cheesequake.

04:57.797 --> 04:59.178
It's guaranteed to make you feel better.

04:59.202 --> 05:00.835
I really appreciate you trying to help,

05:00.860 --> 05:02.046
but I'm not sure it's gonna work.

05:02.070 --> 05:04.936
I mean, I've been at Sprq Point
for five years now,

05:04.961 --> 05:06.725
and I have no idea where I'm gonna go

05:06.750 --> 05:08.202
or what I'm gonna do with my life.

05:08.227 --> 05:09.858
We're gonna figure it out together.

05:10.219 --> 05:12.569
All morning I've had
this terrible feeling

05:12.594 --> 05:14.225
that something bad was gonna happen

05:14.250 --> 05:15.545
and this is clearly it,

05:15.570 --> 05:17.475
- so I think if we...
- Zoey.

05:17.734 --> 05:19.612
Max.

05:20.077 --> 05:22.147
- Simon, hey, you're back.
- I am, I am.

05:22.172 --> 05:23.647
I... I thought I'd surprise you

05:23.672 --> 05:26.053
with a couple of our
favorite Cheesequakes.

05:26.078 --> 05:27.756
Guess you had the same idea.

05:27.781 --> 05:31.249
- You cheered me up with them.
- Mm-hmm.

05:31.387 --> 05:32.913
So I thought that I could cheer...

05:32.938 --> 05:34.702
Max got fired.

05:34.727 --> 05:36.874
- Oh.
- I did, yeah.

05:37.106 --> 05:38.999
Oh, man, that sucks.

05:39.747 --> 05:41.491
Uh, two Cheese...

05:41.516 --> 05:42.866
Should it be three?

05:43.265 --> 05:44.413
Why would it be three?

05:44.438 --> 05:45.858
'Cause you've got some in your bag.

05:45.890 --> 05:47.288
- Just two.
- I think two would be great.

05:47.312 --> 05:48.423
- I have enough.
- Yeah!

05:48.448 --> 05:50.749
Back to the original order...
Two Cheesequakes, please.

05:53.925 --> 05:56.249
Well, I guess I'm gonna
go get some donuts...

05:56.274 --> 05:57.453
- Okay.
- For the rest of the office.

05:57.477 --> 05:58.569
Okay. I'll see you there.

05:58.594 --> 05:59.913
I won't.

05:59.938 --> 06:01.727
'Cause I don't work there anymore.

06:05.799 --> 06:07.332
Was that funny?

06:12.879 --> 06:14.340
- Sorry about that.
- Why?

06:14.365 --> 06:16.686
Simon's pity is exactly
what I wanted today.

06:16.711 --> 06:18.647
So, tell me what happened.

06:18.672 --> 06:21.011
Well, you saw Ava
pull me into her office.

06:21.036 --> 06:22.678
Apparently, unbeknownst to me,

06:22.703 --> 06:25.914
Leif had been sending information
down to the 4th floor,

06:25.939 --> 06:28.251

07:42.321 --> 07:45.124
Yeah. Every single word you said.

07:45.149 --> 07:48.679
I am shocked that Ava would be so...

07:50.978 --> 07:52.522
Oh, my God.

07:52.547 --> 07:53.867
Are you all right?

07:53.892 --> 07:57.023
No! I am so friggin'...

Synced & corrected by QueenMaddie
www.addic7ed.com

08:02.359 --> 08:04.645
Hey, fella. I forgot to ask.

08:04.670 --> 08:06.788
- How was Vegas?
- It was really cool.

08:06.812 --> 08:10.575
It was great to see
my mom so... content.

08:10.600 --> 08:13.046
And surprisingly, I didn't hate
her new husband, either.

08:13.070 --> 08:14.981
So between that and winning

08:15.006 --> 08:17.303
11 bucks at the blackjack table,

08:17.328 --> 08:19.146
I call it a very successful trip.

08:19.171 --> 08:21.396
I can tell. You're practically glowing.

08:21.421 --> 08:25.401
Ah, I think, just for
the first time in a long time,

08:25.426 --> 08:27.529
feels like that cloud
might really be lifting.

08:27.554 --> 08:30.666
That's great. Just to be clear, though,

08:30.691 --> 08:33.837
you're not expecting any bad news today

08:33.861 --> 08:36.302
and this is, like, you majorly
overcompensating, right?

08:36.327 --> 08:37.857
I don't think so.

08:37.881 --> 08:40.863
Though maybe I should
wait to give you...

08:40.888 --> 08:42.044
... this!

08:42.078 --> 08:44.412
- "Tournament of Knights"?
- Hell, yeah!

08:44.437 --> 08:46.756
The giant turkey leg and everything.

08:46.781 --> 08:49.360
- Thank you.
- Those jousters... brave,

08:49.385 --> 08:51.954
bold, inspiring.

08:51.979 --> 08:53.479
Have a seat.

08:55.731 --> 08:57.035
Um...

08:58.226 --> 09:02.372
I wanted to tell you in
case you were concerned...

09:03.654 --> 09:06.584
you don't have to be jealous
of Max and I or anything.

09:06.609 --> 09:08.954
Did I seem jealous earlier?

09:08.979 --> 09:11.680
You were throwing off a little
bit of that energy, yeah.

09:12.359 --> 09:15.412
Well, you weren't wrong.
I was jealous. Super jealous.

09:17.673 --> 09:20.404
That's not something I ever

09:20.429 --> 09:22.896
would have admitted that easily before.

09:23.512 --> 09:25.662
Jessica and I, um...

09:25.687 --> 09:28.633
there's a lot that was
unsaid between us.

09:29.560 --> 09:31.951
I don't want to make that mistake again.

09:31.976 --> 09:35.279
I... I won't make that
mistake again. I...

09:36.294 --> 09:40.474
I am going to try to go
the other way from now on.

09:43.351 --> 09:45.513
I appreciate the honesty.

09:46.555 --> 09:48.443
And the shirt.

09:48.759 --> 09:50.329
I love the t-shirt.

09:50.945 --> 09:52.478
I'm gonna wear this all the time.

09:52.503 --> 09:54.584
- Oh.
- Unironically.

09:54.742 --> 09:56.859
You're welcome.

09:59.879 --> 10:01.038
You're not fooling anyone.

10:01.062 --> 10:02.655
I know exactly what you did, Simply Red.

10:02.679 --> 10:03.779
What are you talking about?

10:03.804 --> 10:05.935
- And why are you in my office?
- Don't do this.

10:05.960 --> 10:08.279
I know that you sent Eddie and
I a fake email saying that Gucci

10:08.303 --> 10:10.797
was having a one-morning-only
90% off sale.

10:10.821 --> 10:12.859
So what did I do? I
put on this ponytail,

10:12.884 --> 10:14.796
ran all the way down to
Gucci and what did I find?

10:14.820 --> 10:16.299
Eddie with his face
pressed against the glass

10:16.323 --> 10:17.578
and no sale in sight!

10:17.603 --> 10:18.603
Okay, fine!

10:18.628 --> 10:20.836
I was just trying to help you
with your creative block.

10:20.861 --> 10:22.156
And I think...

10:22.555 --> 10:24.048
you still want to be with him, and I...

10:24.072 --> 10:25.140
- And...
- You're wrong.

10:25.165 --> 10:26.859
I am not interested in Eddie at all.

10:26.884 --> 10:28.749
He does nothing for me and...

10:28.774 --> 10:30.623
♪ I love him, I love him ♪

10:30.648 --> 10:33.523
♪ I love him and where
he goes I'll follow ♪

10:33.548 --> 10:35.672
♪ I'll follow, I'll follow ♪

10:35.697 --> 10:38.406
♪ I will follow him ♪

10:38.965 --> 10:43.211
♪ Follow him wherever he may go ♪

10:43.922 --> 10:47.902
♪ There isn't an ocean too deep ♪

10:47.927 --> 10:50.873
♪ A mountain so high it can keep ♪

10:50.898 --> 10:54.726
♪ Keep me away ♪

10:54.751 --> 10:58.062
- ♪ I must follow him ♪
- ♪ Follow him ♪

10:58.087 --> 11:02.390
♪ Ever since he touched my hand I knew ♪

11:02.937 --> 11:07.109
♪ That near him I always must be ♪

11:07.134 --> 11:10.008
♪ And nothing can keep him from me ♪

11:10.033 --> 11:14.720
- ♪ He is my destiny ♪
- ♪ Destiny ♪

11:15.518 --> 11:16.893
Why are you looking at me like that?

11:16.917 --> 11:20.830
Because we are now two
Eddie love songs deep,

11:20.855 --> 11:22.866
and however much you want to deny it,

11:22.891 --> 11:24.995
you're not listening to what
your heart's telling you to do

11:25.019 --> 11:29.681
and that seems like the
opposite of the Mo that I know.

11:29.706 --> 11:31.572
You know this whole power of yours?

11:31.597 --> 11:33.130
It's very annoying.

11:36.181 --> 11:38.150
- _
- No, no.

11:44.127 --> 11:46.853
Excuse me. Do you know
where Emily Kang's room is?

11:46.878 --> 11:48.088
No, sorry.

11:48.722 --> 11:49.892
- Zoey.
- What's going on?

11:49.917 --> 11:51.089
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:51.113 --> 11:54.225
False alarm. Just some normal
Braxton-Hicks contractions,

11:54.250 --> 11:55.744
so we're going home.

11:56.058 --> 11:57.892
Baby's messing with us already, I swear.

11:57.917 --> 11:59.698
He's gonna get a real
talking-to when he comes out.

11:59.722 --> 12:01.611
- But the baby's all right?
- Yeah.

12:01.636 --> 12:03.792
Good, 'cause I'm not letting
anything happen to that kid,

12:03.816 --> 12:06.025
not today, no way, no how.

12:06.050 --> 12:07.330
Thanks, Zoey.

12:08.145 --> 12:09.963
Why are you sad right now?

12:09.988 --> 12:12.003
Oh, I... I don't know.
I thought it was gonna happen.

12:12.027 --> 12:14.744
I was excited for Dad
to meet the baby, that's all.

12:15.197 --> 12:16.392
David, did you know there's something

12:16.416 --> 12:18.119
called a nipple shield?

12:18.144 --> 12:19.986
Could be a game-changer!

12:20.379 --> 12:21.627
For my nipples!

12:33.739 --> 12:35.767
It looks scarier than it is.

12:36.702 --> 12:40.593
But it is extraordinary
how many people it's helped.

12:42.648 --> 12:44.486
♪ I got the music in me ♪

12:44.511 --> 12:46.337
♪ I got the music in me ♪

12:46.362 --> 12:48.729
♪ I got the music in me ♪

12:50.611 --> 12:53.275
Joan? Joan?

12:53.495 --> 12:56.516
Joan? W-Where's Joan? Joan?

12:56.541 --> 12:57.813
Danny Michael Davis, uh,

12:57.838 --> 12:59.813
she's just in a meeting
in the conference room.

12:59.838 --> 13:03.556
Oh, great. I often
try not to look north.

13:04.645 --> 13:06.462
But I see her now.

13:06.631 --> 13:08.915
I-I'm Zoey Clarke.
I left you a message earlier.

13:08.940 --> 13:11.891
Yeah, you also sang "Pressure"
to me in a room full of people.

13:11.916 --> 13:14.321
I find you charming and disturbing,

13:14.346 --> 13:16.712
like a Pomeranian wearing a tutu.

13:16.804 --> 13:18.306
Thank you?

13:19.122 --> 13:21.278
Um, anyway, one of
our employees, Max Richman,

13:21.303 --> 13:23.750
got fired, I think unfairly,
after he moved up to the 6th floor

13:23.774 --> 13:26.399
and I was wondering can I hire him back?

13:26.923 --> 13:28.067
Do you believe in him?

13:28.092 --> 13:30.006
- Yes!
- He loves his mother?

13:30.031 --> 13:32.335
- Yes.
- Rocks a mean upright bass?

13:32.360 --> 13:33.543
Yes.

13:33.767 --> 13:35.681
Then let's bring him home.

13:36.182 --> 13:37.815
Thank you.

13:38.570 --> 13:40.470
You won't regret this!

13:42.075 --> 13:44.671
Tony, have them make me
an omelette, hold the eggs.

13:44.696 --> 13:46.453
And I mean, the outsourcing
would bring the cost...

13:46.477 --> 13:47.832
Joan!

13:47.857 --> 13:50.171
- Hello, my children.
- Hi.

13:50.196 --> 13:51.779
I desperately need to talk to Joan.

13:51.804 --> 13:54.482
And if your heart tells you to stay,

13:54.507 --> 13:55.621
then you stay.

13:58.100 --> 14:01.450
Danny, I was trying to call you,

14:01.475 --> 14:04.181
but I couldn't find
a charger, and, uch...

14:04.206 --> 14:05.896
Yeah, yeah, no matter. I happened to be

14:05.921 --> 14:07.450
in the Western Hemisphere and
thought it would be easier

14:07.474 --> 14:08.920
just to, you know, stop by.

14:08.945 --> 14:10.789
Cool, cool. Let's just... yeah.

14:11.327 --> 14:13.327
Oh, so, wow!

14:13.352 --> 14:14.859
So I've recently found myself

14:14.884 --> 14:16.495
in a little bit of trouble with the FCC.

14:16.519 --> 14:18.944
- Oh.
- And the SCC.

14:18.969 --> 14:21.163
And possibly the CIA.

14:21.507 --> 14:24.404
There's a pretty good
chance that I'm gonna be

14:24.429 --> 14:25.804
going away for a while,

14:25.829 --> 14:27.888
so my question to you is,

14:27.913 --> 14:31.058
would you be willing to run Sprq Point
for the next six months?

14:31.083 --> 14:33.622
Eighteen if they find the hard drive
in my sister's basement.

14:33.647 --> 14:36.492
Wow. Um... I...

14:36.780 --> 14:40.102
Wait, so you want me to take
over the entire company?

14:40.126 --> 14:41.803
No, I admit there's gonna
be a lot of press on this,

14:41.827 --> 14:43.772
and the job won't be easy.

14:43.796 --> 14:46.474
There's a board meeting
in Singapore on Friday

14:46.499 --> 14:48.710
and I need you to
come with for approval.

14:48.734 --> 14:50.179
What do you say?

14:50.636 --> 14:52.630
I mean, it's gonna be
a very complicated deal.

14:52.655 --> 14:55.057
I'm gonna have to talk to
my lawyer... of course!

15:03.973 --> 15:06.873
Before you say anything,
let me get this out.

15:08.978 --> 15:11.766
The reason why I broke
up with you is because

15:12.112 --> 15:13.656
I'm afraid.

15:13.681 --> 15:16.152
I'm afraid of opening up to you

15:16.177 --> 15:18.112
and telling you how I really feel.

15:20.034 --> 15:23.690
I haven't always been on
the receiving side of love,

15:24.064 --> 15:26.459
and it makes me feel like
I have to protect myself

15:26.483 --> 15:30.063
and I push people away and
nobody should live like that.

15:30.510 --> 15:32.664
So I want to say before it's too late

15:32.689 --> 15:35.768
that I really care about you,

15:36.306 --> 15:39.572
and I'm willing to make this
work come hell or high water.

15:40.228 --> 15:42.720
That was a cruise ship joke.

15:44.291 --> 15:45.401
Are you not responding because

15:45.425 --> 15:46.569
you don't want to get back together

15:46.593 --> 15:48.137
or because you don't like my comedy?

15:48.161 --> 15:50.135
Either way it's perfectly...

15:54.821 --> 15:57.721
Okay, sailor. Aye, aye.

16:01.752 --> 16:03.563
So hey, what are you in the mood for?

16:03.588 --> 16:06.945
I think we could do a marathon
of Orson Welles films,

16:06.970 --> 16:09.633
or "Sausage Party."
I could go either way.

16:09.658 --> 16:12.931
You pick, but before we get into that...

16:13.627 --> 16:15.098
I need to tell you something.

16:15.775 --> 16:17.953
I got your job back today.

16:17.978 --> 16:19.844
What? How?

16:19.869 --> 16:21.563
I talked to Danny Michael Davis,

16:21.588 --> 16:23.032
and I convinced him.

16:23.056 --> 16:24.955
- You did?
- Sure did.

16:24.980 --> 16:28.517
So, today isn't so bad after all.

16:28.542 --> 16:31.525
It's actually turning out
to be pretty darn good.

16:31.550 --> 16:35.955
Yeah, that's... incredible.
Um, it's just...

16:37.342 --> 16:39.486
I don't want the job back.

16:40.060 --> 16:41.453
Why not?

16:41.478 --> 16:43.619
Well, look, I really appreciate it,

16:43.643 --> 16:45.355
but I liked the way it felt

16:45.379 --> 16:47.524
being in charge on the 6th floor.

16:47.549 --> 16:50.308
It made me feel good,
and I was good at it.

16:50.978 --> 16:53.519
I just don't want to go backwards, Zoey.

16:53.544 --> 16:55.784
I was actually walking
around North Beach today

16:55.809 --> 16:57.972
just thinking, and I realized that

16:57.997 --> 17:00.105
I'm excited about the future, you know?

17:00.130 --> 17:03.925
Diving into the unknown,
trying something new.

17:03.950 --> 17:06.580
It might be scary, but... Are you mad?

17:06.606 --> 17:10.152
No. I...

17:10.309 --> 17:13.002
like seeing this side of you.

17:13.028 --> 17:15.839
Oh, cool. Well, yeah,
I just feel like life is short,

17:15.864 --> 17:17.377
and I'm not sure what...

17:22.057 --> 17:23.869
Why'd you do that?

17:24.823 --> 17:27.220
'Cause I felt like it.

17:30.193 --> 17:31.964

that would be great.

18:52.774 --> 18:54.752
Yeah, I could do that.

make your mind go blank?

Okay.

19:32.822 --> 19:34.366
Come here.

19:37.316 --> 19:39.038
Don't get that, please.

19:39.062 --> 19:40.573
Oh...

19:41.612 --> 19:42.970
I just have to check,

19:42.995 --> 19:45.600
and I'll only answer it if it's, um...

19:49.769 --> 19:52.919
Hello? Hi, Howie.

19:53.456 --> 19:55.268
No, yeah.

19:55.503 --> 19:57.135
I'll be right there.

19:59.745 --> 20:01.316
What was that?

20:01.577 --> 20:03.277
The bad moon.

20:04.716 --> 20:06.483
It rose.

20:13.752 --> 20:14.877
Zoey.

20:14.902 --> 20:17.370
Can you come in the kitchen
for a moment, please?

20:18.847 --> 20:21.808
Uh, can you just give me, um, a minute?

20:21.833 --> 20:22.966
Sure.

20:25.363 --> 20:27.205
Over the past couple weeks,

20:27.230 --> 20:30.142
Mitch has been decreasing
his food and fluid intake

20:30.166 --> 20:31.322
by the day.

20:31.347 --> 20:34.362
He has now completely lost
the ability to swallow.

20:34.614 --> 20:36.394
In a matter of hours,

20:36.419 --> 20:38.808
his organs will shut down.

20:39.840 --> 20:42.566
I have a steady supply of morphine

20:42.591 --> 20:44.391
to keep him comfortable.

20:45.681 --> 20:49.961
I know, as much as you
have prepared for this moment,

20:49.986 --> 20:52.237
you can only prepare so much.

20:52.262 --> 20:56.142
But I'm here,
and will do everything I can,

20:56.167 --> 20:58.894
to help ease this transition
for everyone.

20:58.919 --> 21:00.962
I just can't believe
he's not even gonna get

21:00.987 --> 21:03.667
to meet his grandson, you know?

21:03.692 --> 21:07.094
I don't... I feel really...
I gotta go lie down.

21:07.969 --> 21:10.025
Emily, why don't you go
and sit with him?

21:10.050 --> 21:12.261
And I'll be in in a minute.

21:32.131 --> 21:36.105
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Simon, hey. It's Max.

21:36.799 --> 21:39.478
Zoey's dad isn't doing well, and...

21:39.502 --> 21:41.969
<i>I think she wanted you to know that.</i>

21:43.992 --> 21:46.269
Can I do anything?

21:46.980 --> 21:49.120
Uh, maybe just shoot her a text,

21:49.145 --> 21:52.347
or whatever you guys do and...

21:52.636 --> 21:54.042
Whenever you can.

21:54.536 --> 21:56.831
Hey, Max, um...

21:57.554 --> 21:59.339
Thanks for calling.

21:59.722 --> 22:01.425
I appreciate it.

22:03.475 --> 22:05.209
Yeah.

22:06.008 --> 22:08.942
David, do you want to go talk to him?

22:10.448 --> 22:13.284
I do. Uh... I mean...

22:13.309 --> 22:15.713
I have so much I want to ask
him and say to him still,

22:15.738 --> 22:18.198
but I don't... I don't want
him to see me like this.

22:18.223 --> 22:20.425
He never held back his emotions.

22:20.450 --> 22:21.983
You shouldn't either.

22:24.181 --> 22:26.824
Since when did you turn
into our spiritual guru?

22:26.849 --> 22:30.084
Ever since a magical MRI
machine changed me forever.

22:34.361 --> 22:36.568
Should I stay in here, or...

22:36.593 --> 22:41.355
No, no. You're my wife,
and he loves you.

22:41.380 --> 22:43.146
He'd want to say goodbye.

22:51.871 --> 22:54.167
Oh, wait. I want to say goodbye to you.

22:55.855 --> 22:58.386
- I'm so sorry, Maggie.
- I know.

22:58.708 --> 23:01.941
I'm so glad you were here.
Did you get a chance to...

23:01.966 --> 23:04.099
Yeah, I did, I did.

23:05.644 --> 23:07.769
And, uh...

23:07.910 --> 23:11.042
I let him know exactly
how I feel about his daughter.

23:13.020 --> 23:15.300
I'm pretty sure he already knows.

25:55.534 --> 25:57.486
Listen, about earlier...

25:57.510 --> 26:00.360
Look, we will have
plenty of time to talk about,

26:00.385 --> 26:02.493
dissect, and analyze that

26:02.518 --> 26:04.689
which I'm sure we will do ad nauseum.

26:05.726 --> 26:07.157
Just...

26:08.392 --> 26:10.665
focus on yourself right now.

26:10.985 --> 26:12.368
Okay?

26:21.174 --> 26:23.642
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

26:36.795 --> 26:38.861
You weren't supposed to see me.

26:39.923 --> 26:42.765
I was just gonna drop off
this lasagna that I made.

26:42.790 --> 26:45.437
- You made lasagna?
- Yeah. I just remembered

26:45.462 --> 26:48.142
a lot of people brought
over casseroles for us.

26:48.563 --> 26:50.423
Seemed like the thing to do.

26:51.913 --> 26:54.197
Hey, I'm... I'm so sorry.

26:54.222 --> 26:55.875
I'm gonna let you get back in there.

26:55.900 --> 26:59.020
Just know that I know.

26:59.462 --> 27:02.756
And I'm here, whenever you need me.

27:04.103 --> 27:05.290
You helped me and I'm...

27:05.315 --> 27:07.587
I'm more than ready to return the favor.

27:09.079 --> 27:10.962
Do you still have that
grief basket I gave you?

27:10.987 --> 27:12.131
I might need it.

27:12.156 --> 27:13.892
Oh, you're gonna get your very own.

27:13.917 --> 27:15.259
Maybe a grief duffle.

27:15.284 --> 27:16.868
Or a trunk.

27:17.377 --> 27:19.400
I go big or go home.

27:25.861 --> 27:28.353
I'm just gonna go upstairs
and rest for a little bit.

27:28.378 --> 27:30.679
- Is that okay?
- Of course, yeah.

27:33.133 --> 27:35.025
Is it weird if I eat something?

27:41.895 --> 27:45.103
What is... is that lasagna?

27:46.741 --> 27:48.728
Yeah, Howie and I moved him.

27:48.753 --> 27:51.632
Just thought he'd be
more comfortable in bed.

29:07.661 --> 29:12.097
Is this when we have the talk
about what death is like?

29:13.399 --> 29:15.004
Depends.

29:16.080 --> 29:19.599
Are you looking for some
deep insights from me,

29:19.624 --> 29:21.676
some words of wisdom?

29:23.185 --> 29:25.504
I'm game if you got 'em.

29:27.899 --> 29:32.580
Death is hideous,
and ugly, and grotesque,

29:32.604 --> 29:36.806
and wildly, wildly unfair.

29:38.636 --> 29:40.420
Or, maybe...

29:40.445 --> 29:44.510
death is beautiful, and spiritual,

29:44.535 --> 29:48.429
and transcendent,
and sometimes a very necessary

29:48.453 --> 29:51.705
and very freeing escape
from our physical bodies

29:51.730 --> 29:54.933
when they are no longer habitable.

29:56.301 --> 29:58.869
Which way do you think I
should choose to look at it?

30:01.488 --> 30:04.682
Zoey, if you'd like to go
talk to your dad,

30:04.707 --> 30:07.527
I think now would be a good time.

30:13.902 --> 30:15.698
Hey, Dad.

30:19.681 --> 30:24.117
I'm going to try to go
another way with this tonight.

30:31.581 --> 30:34.107
I'm doing pretty well at work.

30:35.105 --> 30:37.361
Uh, that guy that I liked

30:37.386 --> 30:40.180
who was engaged now likes me.

30:40.902 --> 30:44.011
Although I did just hook up
with my best friend, so...

30:44.761 --> 30:46.832
that complicates things.

30:49.402 --> 30:52.721
Oh, and those big musical
numbers I've been hearing?

30:52.746 --> 30:54.979
This might be totally crazy, but

30:55.004 --> 31:00.011
I'm not sure I'm minding them...

31:00.465 --> 31:02.160
like I used to.

31:03.004 --> 31:06.097
I think that they might
actually be helping me.

31:07.735 --> 31:09.601
Believe me, I'm not...

31:12.629 --> 31:14.668
doing well, but...

31:16.285 --> 31:18.754
I'm not doing that badly, either.

31:19.301 --> 31:22.330
Thought maybe you'd want to hear that,

31:22.355 --> 31:24.340
that your daughter's okay.

31:25.254 --> 31:27.654
You know, in case
you were worried or anything.

31:30.371 --> 31:31.912
Howie?

31:32.317 --> 31:35.100
- What's happening right now?
- David?

31:35.462 --> 31:37.975
His lungs are...

31:38.000 --> 31:40.311
Let me give him some more morphine.

31:40.926 --> 31:43.733
- This is normal?
- Yes.

32:04.759 --> 32:06.637
I love you so much.

32:06.662 --> 32:08.474
It's okay. It's gonna be okay.

32:08.499 --> 32:11.061
- You doing okay?
- You are so loved.

32:11.590 --> 32:13.989
I love you, my darling.

32:16.018 --> 32:18.295
I love you so much.

32:18.710 --> 32:20.795
You'll be okay.

32:22.707 --> 32:24.428
- Psst!
- ... so much.

32:24.453 --> 32:25.953
Over here!

32:27.168 --> 32:29.401
I want to talk to you for a minute.

32:33.154 --> 32:35.186
Come on!

32:52.863 --> 32:54.936
Dance with me.

33:10.013 --> 33:12.224
I don't hear any music.

33:12.249 --> 33:14.115
Sure you do, Zoey.

33:15.546 --> 33:17.029
What do you call those songs

33:17.054 --> 33:19.154
that other people keep singing to you?

33:20.579 --> 33:22.608
Heart songs.

33:24.025 --> 33:26.295
Well, that's a good name for them.

33:30.848 --> 33:33.623
But what do I do when
I can't hear you sing anymore?

33:33.648 --> 33:36.394
Oh, you're always gonna hear me,

33:36.666 --> 33:38.910
whether it's a song or not.

33:39.348 --> 33:43.670
All you have to do is... listen.

33:45.194 --> 33:48.537
Oh, what are you looking over there for?

33:51.790 --> 33:53.772
I'm right here.

34:06.528 --> 34:08.161
Now...

34:09.812 --> 34:14.420
I know we can do better than this.

35:09.465 --> 35:11.122
Shall we do this?

35:13.145 --> 35:16.106
We can stay in the car a few
more minutes if you want, Mom.

35:16.639 --> 35:18.269
Yeah, we don't mind.

35:18.505 --> 35:21.387
I actually prefer this
to being around people.

35:23.993 --> 35:25.762
No.

35:28.338 --> 35:30.074
It's okay. I mean, I guess we've gotta
