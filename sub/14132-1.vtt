WEBVTT

03:49.751 --> 03:51.959
Hitching at this hour!

04:15.376 --> 04:17.584
You left your lights on.

04:32.917 --> 04:34.084
Asshole!

04:43.459 --> 04:49.417
Half a mile back and you'd be dead.

04:54.542 --> 04:57.209
If you'd been driving,
you'd have...

04:57.751 --> 05:01.251
No, you'd have given the bum a lift.

05:01.917 --> 05:03.667
Sorry, darling.

05:10.417 --> 05:13.167
Want the front seat or the back?

05:17.459 --> 05:23.209
Why not grab some sleep?
We'll try not to disturb you.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.417
Today's Sunday.

05:53.209 --> 05:56.334
Trucks don't run on Sundays.

06:01.209 --> 06:04.709
Very fancy.
Could be an embassy car.

06:05.376 --> 06:07.126
Foreigners give lifts.

06:08.501 --> 06:12.459
- You could've been diplomats.
- Or a diplomat's chauffeur on an outing.

06:15.251 --> 06:17.084
I'm not blind.

06:19.626 --> 06:21.667
Polish plates.

06:22.126 --> 06:26.084
You don't look like
an embassy chauffeur.

06:26.792 --> 06:29.667
There are more
privately-owned cars now.

06:31.876 --> 06:37.209
I saw a Mercedes 190
and two Jaguars in Warsaw.

06:41.626 --> 06:44.376
We're well over the speed limit...

06:44.917 --> 06:47.001
He's an experienced driver.

06:49.292 --> 06:52.626
Where are you headed?
We're going to the marina.

06:53.251 --> 06:57.584
Fine.
Pity you aren't going farther.

06:58.959 --> 07:00.709
What if I hadn't pulled up?

07:01.834 --> 07:03.584
I'd be dead.

07:05.584 --> 07:07.792
You do it for kicks?

07:08.292 --> 07:10.292
Life gets boring.

07:11.876 --> 07:13.959
How old are you?

07:14.417 --> 07:17.542
Charged with manslaughter
for running over a puppy.

08:07.417 --> 08:09.334
Where to?

08:56.126 --> 09:01.417
- Just dump the bag.
- I'll bring it to you.

09:38.501 --> 09:41.917
- Club boat?
- No, she's ours.

09:46.709 --> 09:49.126
Well, I'll be going.

10:00.209 --> 10:03.126
- Here a minute.
- I've a long way to go.

10:03.709 --> 10:05.251
I'll tell you something.

10:21.001 --> 10:24.501
- The bilge is full of water.
- So bail it out.

10:26.334 --> 10:28.417
Give you some advice.

10:30.792 --> 10:35.292
Don't do it again.
Some people have no reflexes.

10:36.084 --> 10:38.542
That's the way I hitch.

10:39.042 --> 10:41.417
Except some folk brake sooner.

10:42.917 --> 10:45.042
And don't give lifts.

10:45.542 --> 10:47.292
I meant to scare you.

10:50.209 --> 10:51.334
You did.

10:55.459 --> 10:57.209
Cast off, will you?

11:17.542 --> 11:20.667
- Ever done any sailing?
- No. I walk.

11:24.959 --> 11:30.084
- You've got a treat in store, then.
- I like walking.

11:31.626 --> 11:35.042
- I may try sailing someday.
- We only came for the day.

11:37.167 --> 11:38.917
Me too.

11:45.001 --> 11:48.876
- You left the windshield wipers?
- They won't get stolen around here.

11:58.626 --> 12:02.167
- How long are you going out for?
- Just till dawn.

12:02.834 --> 12:08.376
Can I meet you then
and hitch a ride back?

12:10.084 --> 12:12.542
I thought you wanted to have a go.

12:14.251 --> 12:17.001
- You need a hand, huh?
- We'll manage.

12:21.084 --> 12:24.167
- You wouldn't have chickened out?
- I knew you'd pull up in time.

12:24.751 --> 12:27.292
You're a bum
but you're okay'.

12:59.917 --> 13:01.667
I knew you'd call me back.

13:04.501 --> 13:06.417
I'm a mind reader.

13:06.876 --> 13:10.001
- You want to go on with the game.
- You aren't in my class, kid.

13:12.459 --> 13:14.209
But come aboard.

14:04.667 --> 14:06.417
You need quick reflexes...

14:10.084 --> 14:12.042
...and discipline.

14:12.501 --> 14:15.209
When I was training we had a bosun.

14:15.751 --> 14:20.126
What was his name, Krystyna?

14:21.376 --> 14:24.042
He'd say: "Shin up that willow tree."

14:24.584 --> 14:26.251
It was an oak

14:26.667 --> 14:29.251
but we called it a willow
if he said so.

14:31.459 --> 14:35.501
Shit.
Sorry, lots of water down there.

14:36.251 --> 14:39.667
We'd perch in the willow
for an hour or two.

14:40.334 --> 14:42.084
The oak, you mean.

14:43.709 --> 14:45.667
To us it was a willow.

14:46.126 --> 14:51.542
He'd tell us
to cuckoo like cuckoos.

14:52.459 --> 14:54.376
Did you?

14:54.834 --> 14:57.501
Brains weren't his strong point

14:59.584 --> 15:01.876
but he made men out of us.

15:49.834 --> 15:53.542
- Are we moving?
- Spit in the water.

16:05.417 --> 16:07.167
We are moving!

16:11.751 --> 16:15.959
- You can also dunk your foot.
- You can, but you don't.

16:19.292 --> 16:21.584
This isn't Lourdes.

16:25.584 --> 16:27.334
I think I forgot the salt.

16:29.334 --> 16:31.084
No, I didn't.

16:44.667 --> 16:46.876
Did you name her after your wife?

16:50.917 --> 16:53.209
I left the cucumbers behind.

16:53.709 --> 16:57.376
Is that your wife's name,
"Christine"?

16:58.042 --> 16:59.792
Krystyna.

17:04.459 --> 17:06.459
You haven't lost the keys?

17:08.917 --> 17:10.667
They're on the table.

17:24.084 --> 17:28.001
You like black radishes?

17:35.042 --> 17:38.459
Great!
I'd never have thought of it.

17:39.126 --> 17:42.542
Nothing like vitamins.

17:44.334 --> 17:46.084
Here.

17:49.376 --> 17:51.917
Why do you carry that murderous thing?

17:53.667 --> 17:56.167
A knife comes in handy.

17:57.667 --> 17:59.417
Especially in the woods.

18:01.167 --> 18:03.417
You don't need one on the water

18:03.917 --> 18:09.667
but cutting your way
through the woods...

18:20.209 --> 18:22.751
Sailing's easy.

18:25.459 --> 18:29.501
It's when you hike you need a knife.

18:30.209 --> 18:32.459
That's how it is in life.

18:34.167 --> 18:35.917
You're a real child.

18:38.501 --> 18:40.501
You could cut yourself.

18:40.959 --> 18:43.084
Did you ever cut yourself?

18:44.542 --> 18:48.042
Take care, you never know.

18:52.251 --> 18:56.959
I knew a seaman once
wanted to show off.

18:58.917 --> 19:01.667
His pals were brighter than him.

19:02.209 --> 19:04.501
They could tell jokes,

19:06.292 --> 19:08.584
do card tricks.

19:13.751 --> 19:18.459
Anyway,
he took a couple of bottles

19:19.292 --> 19:23.876
smashed them on the floor
took off his boots, climbed on a table...

19:27.459 --> 19:29.376
Bored?

19:29.834 --> 19:31.584
Coil that warp.

19:34.251 --> 19:36.001
Show me how it's done.

19:37.334 --> 19:40.084
I'm at the helm
you can't take over.

19:41.542 --> 19:44.334
- I can try.
- You've got to know how.

19:44.917 --> 19:46.834
It doesn't look that hard.

19:48.917 --> 19:50.667
Make for that buoy.

20:22.459 --> 20:24.626
It takes brains, not brawn.

20:30.001 --> 20:32.167
Better get back to that warp.

20:32.667 --> 20:34.334
Who are you ordering around?

20:34.751 --> 20:37.292
If two men are on board
one's the skipper.

20:37.792 --> 20:39.917
Or the drill Sergeant.

20:44.417 --> 20:46.167
Were you in the army?

20:47.459 --> 20:49.042
University.

20:49.417 --> 20:51.167
What are you?

20:55.251 --> 20:57.001
A gynaecologist?

20:59.709 --> 21:01.542
I write.

21:01.959 --> 21:03.709
Like what?

21:05.334 --> 21:07.584
Ever read the "Sporting News"?

22:40.751 --> 22:42.501
Throw me my rucksack, please.

22:45.667 --> 22:47.834
I'm off.

22:48.834 --> 22:50.501
I'm a hiker, not a coolie.

22:50.917 --> 22:52.667
You're soft.

22:53.084 --> 22:55.959
There are 120 lakes here.
Why go this way?

22:56.542 --> 22:59.209
Give the gentleman his rucksack.

23:02.417 --> 23:03.876
We'll go back another way.

23:04.251 --> 23:08.084
Without me.
I'm no sucker.

23:11.417 --> 23:13.167
Take my place.

23:19.417 --> 23:21.334
I wasn't talking to you.

23:23.792 --> 23:26.709
Why don't you both get in?

24:38.459 --> 24:40.209
12 noon.

24:41.501 --> 24:43.501
It's ten past.

24:43.959 --> 24:45.709
He doesn't have a watch.

25:30.459 --> 25:32.209
Cooking something?

25:39.959 --> 25:41.709
A compass.

25:50.584 --> 25:52.334
A big one.

25:53.959 --> 25:55.709
No use for hiking.

26:14.917 --> 26:17.126
You don't whistle on board.

26:18.501 --> 26:19.709
Why not?

26:20.042 --> 26:24.542
It's not done.
Seamen get mastheaded for that.

26:25.334 --> 26:27.084
Not hikers, though.

27:00.334 --> 27:02.084
Shall I cuckoo?

27:04.584 --> 27:07.709
- I should kick your ass!
- Let's head for shore.

27:09.667 --> 27:12.542
If you can reach me.

27:16.001 --> 27:19.917
- Does he get a gold star?
- Andrzej, please!

27:27.667 --> 27:29.417
Okay, I'll take the helm.

27:52.751 --> 27:55.584
- Where are my boots?
- Where you chucked them.

29:11.542 --> 29:13.292
Rub some on my back.

29:47.292 --> 29:49.042
- Sheep!
- Who?

29:50.792 --> 29:52.542
That cloud looks like a sheep.

30:08.292 --> 30:10.209
The one on the left does.

30:17.542 --> 30:19.292
It's breaking up.

30:20.751 --> 30:22.667
Going to be a storm.

30:23.126 --> 30:26.917
- What's that, a gut feeling?
- Time for a swim.

30:37.209 --> 30:38.959
We aren't moving.

30:41.084 --> 30:42.834
The wind's dropped.

30:45.126 --> 30:46.876
What now?

30:47.917 --> 30:51.501
Lunch.
That's a gut feeling.

31:22.167 --> 31:25.167
No finger bowls?

32:00.667 --> 32:02.417
That gadget your invention?

32:14.626 --> 32:16.751
You don't think it's necessary?

32:19.584 --> 32:21.334
Try it without.

32:47.584 --> 32:49.334
You spilled the soup.

33:00.959 --> 33:02.709
Sit down.

33:33.292 --> 33:35.042
Not eating?

33:36.876 --> 33:39.251
I want to get off.

33:39.751 --> 33:41.501
You can paddle ashore.

33:46.042 --> 33:47.709
It's in the fo'c's'le.

33:48.126 --> 33:49.876
We're having lunch now.

33:51.792 --> 33:54.292
Sailing's for grown-ups.

33:54.834 --> 33:57.834
You wait for the wind.

33:58.417 --> 34:00.167
A waste of time.

34:02.209 --> 34:05.626
- What would you do?
- Walk.

34:06.251 --> 34:09.209
You walk for walking's sake.

34:11.251 --> 34:14.042
Stop being silly and eat.

35:06.792 --> 35:09.667
Steer for the shore.

35:10.251 --> 35:13.501
- Was that an order?
- It was. Change course.

35:14.126 --> 35:16.376
I want to land.

35:16.959 --> 35:20.792
- There's land all around.
- This side's nearer.

35:21.501 --> 35:22.459
And shallower.

35:22.751 --> 35:25.584
So?
We'll run aground paddling?

35:26.126 --> 35:29.334
Come on.
We'll find a way through.

35:50.584 --> 35:53.709
- Why did he climb on the table?
- Who?

35:54.334 --> 35:59.251
The bosun who smashed the bottles.

36:00.084 --> 36:02.542
He was a seaman
not a bosun.

36:04.626 --> 36:10.167
He jumped on the broken glass.
Blood spurted everywhere.

36:11.084 --> 36:12.834
Tough guy.

37:22.126 --> 37:23.584
Take your bib off.

37:25.459 --> 37:27.084
Jump!

37:27.501 --> 37:30.334
- Go get that paddle!
- I can't swim.

37:30.917 --> 37:32.876
You want me to drown?

37:33.334 --> 37:35.084
Jump, I said!

37:58.584 --> 38:00.334
Give me the crocodile.

38:35.667 --> 38:37.376
You'll ruin the deck.

38:37.792 --> 38:40.084
I've got a delicate touch.

38:44.459 --> 38:48.501
You'd swim if you fell in.

38:50.167 --> 38:51.917
You try.

38:58.209 --> 38:59.959
I'm only kidding.

39:34.834 --> 39:38.542
There's a first-aid kit below.
Go dress those burns.

39:41.001 --> 39:42.751
Need help?

43:25.251 --> 43:29.501
Let it go!

44:25.001 --> 44:26.667
You were rattled.

44:27.084 --> 44:30.917
I didn't know where the wind was.

44:32.251 --> 44:34.042
Next time check those telltales.

44:38.917 --> 44:41.126
Want to try balancing her?

44:41.584 --> 44:44.001
Show us what you're made of.

44:44.501 --> 44:47.501
- Lean over the side, you mean?
- Yes.

44:48.084 --> 44:49.584
It takes guts.

45:03.334 --> 45:05.209
We're sailing!

45:05.667 --> 45:07.167
Sure, for sailings sake.

45:08.876 --> 45:11.251
Or walking's sake!

47:20.126 --> 47:21.876
Knife!

47:35.584 --> 47:37.167
I said it was shallow.

47:37.584 --> 47:39.334
You had the helm.

47:56.459 --> 47:58.084
Let's push her off.

47:58.501 --> 48:00.251
The wind's dropped.

48:39.709 --> 48:41.459
It's quite deep there.

48:43.084 --> 48:44.834
Hand me the oar.

51:10.334 --> 51:12.084
Don't look.

51:46.126 --> 51:48.876
Pass us some cups.

51:55.501 --> 51:56.959
Medicine.

52:04.251 --> 52:06.001
To those at sea.

52:12.542 --> 52:14.292
Let's blow up the mattresses.

52:26.459 --> 52:28.209
See who does it first.

53:09.209 --> 53:11.334
Some asshole they've sent to Ankara!

53:11.792 --> 53:14.792
- Our best middleweight.
- I meant the commentator.

53:15.376 --> 53:18.417
D'you play bridge?
Pity.

53:19.584 --> 53:21.959
- No cards?
- No fourth.

53:22.459 --> 53:26.042
- We could play with a dummy.
- No dummies on this boat.

53:49.709 --> 53:51.459
Here are the real ones.

53:59.667 --> 54:02.251
- You start.
- I don't know the game.

54:05.876 --> 54:06.876
Come on, get on with it.

54:14.251 --> 54:15.584
The loser pays a forfeit.

54:24.751 --> 54:26.501
You mustn't move the others, right?

54:34.334 --> 54:36.084
It's quite simple.

54:47.459 --> 54:49.209
You moved one.

54:51.251 --> 54:53.001
A forfeit.

55:03.626 --> 55:05.376
Thank you.

55:18.876 --> 55:22.084
Use that delicate touch.

55:51.917 --> 55:53.751
That one was safe.

56:10.542 --> 56:12.292
My forfeit.

56:40.917 --> 56:43.626
What's the price of this forfeit?

56:47.042 --> 56:50.334
What's the price of this forfeit?

56:50.959 --> 56:52.709
A song.

56:55.292 --> 56:57.042
Lucky it's your forfeit.

56:59.251 --> 57:01.376
Show him what a nice voice you have.

57:01.834 --> 57:03.584
Sing that song you were humming.

57:08.959 --> 57:13.251
Guest's request.
You're outvoted, skipper.

57:18.292 --> 57:21.584
- Suit yourself.
- No, listen to your fight.

57:50.751 --> 57:52.501
I can't.

57:53.459 --> 57:55.042
I'm not in the mood.

57:55.459 --> 57:57.209
You won't get your forfeit.

58:01.126 --> 58:06.126
Say no more, no more...

58:07.001 --> 58:12.167
Don't look that way,
Let me go...

58:13.084 --> 58:18.084
We're out of words
and moons, and stars!...

58:18.959 --> 58:23.667
There's no tenderness in us...

58:24.501 --> 58:29.167
Don't lie any more,
don't beg...

58:29.959 --> 58:34.917
You know there's nothing...

58:35.792 --> 58:40.209
Though life is empty,
you don't need me...

58:41.001 --> 58:46.501
Joy has Faded
and our love's gone sour...

59:14.709 --> 59:16.251
I've forgotten the rest.

59:16.667 --> 59:18.792
Stupid song.

59:19.251 --> 59:21.001
I wonder who KO'd Molik?

59:25.042 --> 59:26.959
What's the price of this forfeit?

59:27.417 --> 59:29.167
A poem.

59:40.459 --> 59:42.209
How did he get KO'd?

59:43.751 --> 59:46.917
Night.
The oil in my lamp is low...

59:47.542 --> 59:49.751
Mosquitoes whine about me...

59:50.251 --> 59:53.209
That handful of stars above

59:53.792 --> 59:55.542
Mother, are they you?

59:56.917 --> 59:59.417
Are you the white sail on the lake,

1:00:00.626 --> 1:00:03.167
Or the waves that lap the shore?

1:00:03.709 --> 1:00:07.709
Have you strewn
my pages with Stardust?

1:00:26.542 --> 1:00:29.376
Excellent memory.

1:00:29.959 --> 1:00:31.709
You can turn on the radio.

1:00:37.501 --> 1:00:39.251
That's how it's done.

1:00:39.667 --> 1:00:42.834
I knew a guy who could beat me.

1:00:43.459 --> 1:00:45.876
A genius at the game.

1:00:49.667 --> 1:00:52.626
Name of Mayzner.

1:00:53.209 --> 1:00:57.167
Had a big boat, 12 metres.

1:00:58.792 --> 1:01:04.209
He was good.
A qualified skipper.

1:01:06.251 --> 1:01:09.084
Forged his papers,
got caught.

1:01:10.876 --> 1:01:12.792
Still, he was okay.

1:01:13.251 --> 1:01:15.001
He'd say:

1:01:18.709 --> 1:01:23.167
jackstraws isn't just a game.

1:01:23.959 --> 1:01:27.292
It's a living organism.

1:01:30.376 --> 1:01:33.876
- What?
- I didn't say anything.

1:01:34.542 --> 1:01:36.292
He's fast asleep.

1:01:38.459 --> 1:01:39.751
Must be tired.

1:01:40.084 --> 1:01:41.834
He probably slept rough last night.

1:01:44.959 --> 1:01:48.334
- Why did you take him along?
- He may be shamming.

1:01:51.209 --> 1:01:54.959
- What time shall I set it for?
- 5 A.M.

1:01:57.959 --> 1:01:59.709
I've got a meeting at 9.

1:03:11.042 --> 1:03:12.751
I heard you go on deck.

1:03:15.084 --> 1:03:17.042
You weren't asleep?

1:03:17.459 --> 1:03:19.251
I'm a light sleeper.

1:03:32.376 --> 1:03:34.084
I couldn't sleep either.

1:03:39.334 --> 1:03:41.126
It's stuffy.

1:03:51.626 --> 1:03:53.334
The rain didn't help any.

1:04:04.167 --> 1:04:05.876
When do we get going?

1:04:07.126 --> 1:04:10.334
We cut the halyard.
Got to mend it.

1:04:12.626 --> 1:04:14.417
The bilge needs emptying.

1:04:16.209 --> 1:04:18.001
Get some sleep.

1:04:19.459 --> 1:04:21.251
Shall I bail out?

1:06:32.709 --> 1:06:35.792
Early birds, huh?
5 A.M., we said.

1:06:36.376 --> 1:06:38.376
We're fixing the halyard.

1:06:38.876 --> 1:06:40.001
I didn't sleep a wink.

1:06:40.376 --> 1:06:43.501
What should I do with this thing?

1:06:46.001 --> 1:06:47.709
Take the helm.

1:06:51.417 --> 1:06:54.459
Get the anchor up.

1:07:09.417 --> 1:07:11.126
Stow it in the fo'c's'le.

1:07:19.084 --> 1:07:21.042
Get down there.

1:07:21.501 --> 1:07:23.209
What for?

1:07:23.667 --> 1:07:26.292
Get in the fo'c's'le.

1:07:31.001 --> 1:07:32.792
You'll find a box there.

1:07:36.292 --> 1:07:39.126
We'll be ashore soon.
Stop acting the skipper.

1:07:39.709 --> 1:07:41.417
There's a rag in the box.

1:07:44.584 --> 1:07:46.376
Got it?

1:07:51.251 --> 1:07:54.709
That's not all.
The bucket too.

1:08:02.126 --> 1:08:04.417
- I want that deck swabbed.
- Can't I do it?

1:08:04.917 --> 1:08:06.709
Stay at the helm.

1:08:31.667 --> 1:08:34.084
Been an instructive trip, huh?

1:08:41.792 --> 1:08:44.917
Nice to make new friends.

1:09:52.126 --> 1:09:54.751
- Say something nice to him.
- Just make for that boy.

1:10:05.251 --> 1:10:07.042
Where's my knife?

1:10:11.917 --> 1:10:13.501
What happened to my knife?

1:10:18.626 --> 1:10:22.251
Easy, nothing gets lost on this boat.

1:10:24.084 --> 1:10:27.626
I didn't say it was lost.
Where is it?

1:10:28.751 --> 1:10:30.709
In my pocket.

1:10:32.626 --> 1:10:34.417
Why did you take it?

1:10:34.834 --> 1:10:37.042
Think I was scared of you?

1:10:38.459 --> 1:10:42.584
I don't need a knife to handle myself.

1:10:43.292 --> 1:10:45.084
I want it back.

1:10:47.167 --> 1:10:49.042
Come and get it.

1:10:55.709 --> 1:10:57.501
Give me back my knife.

1:11:12.334 --> 1:11:14.084
Jump!

1:12:00.126 --> 1:12:01.126
He'll drown!

1:12:03.459 --> 1:12:05.251
He hasn't come up.

1:12:08.459 --> 1:12:11.209
Don't worry, he can swim.

1:12:13.209 --> 1:12:14.959
- He said he...
- He was lying.

1:12:37.501 --> 1:12:39.209
Farther to the right!

1:12:41.626 --> 1:12:43.334
To the right!
There!

1:13:01.626 --> 1:13:03.459
He must be clinging to the buoy.

1:13:16.001 --> 1:13:18.542
- No sign of him.
- Check the other side.

1:13:27.751 --> 1:13:29.042
Nothing!

1:14:23.417 --> 1:14:25.167
You've drowned him!

1:14:35.626 --> 1:14:37.459
What was his name?

1:14:37.876 --> 1:14:40.376
- He's got to come up.
- He couldn't swim.

1:14:40.876 --> 1:14:42.834
He didn't even take a dip.

1:14:44.917 --> 1:14:47.626
- How deep is it here?
- 20-30 feet.

1:14:48.167 --> 1:14:50.084
Deepen

1:14:50.501 --> 1:14:52.709
Dive again.
Call the police.

1:14:53.167 --> 1:14:55.417
Much good that would do.

1:14:55.917 --> 1:14:59.001
See, you admit it!
You've drowned him!

1:15:02.459 --> 1:15:03.709
Stop yelling!

1:15:24.751 --> 1:15:26.626
Murderer!

1:15:27.084 --> 1:15:28.709
You're scared!

1:15:29.126 --> 1:15:32.084
Lost your nerve. Tough guy!

1:15:32.709 --> 1:15:35.042
Phoney! Clown!

1:15:37.042 --> 1:15:41.042
You only took him along to show off!

1:15:43.084 --> 1:15:44.501
What d'you think you look like?

1:15:44.917 --> 1:15:47.167
- Like your wife.
- Without me you'd be a whore!

1:15:50.209 --> 1:15:51.751
I hate you!

1:15:52.167 --> 1:15:53.626
Push off, then!

1:15:55.042 --> 1:15:58.417
- I'm sick of you!
- Push off yourself!

1:16:00.001 --> 1:16:02.251
You think I'm scared of the police?

1:16:04.834 --> 1:16:06.584
You make me vomit!

1:16:20.751 --> 1:16:24.959
Still showing off.
You'll be back.

1:18:19.209 --> 1:18:20.959
So you can swim!

1:18:27.667 --> 1:18:30.542
I didn't hear you.
My teeth were chattering.

1:18:31.084 --> 1:18:33.751
Come back!

1:18:34.251 --> 1:18:36.251
Let's try together.

1:18:53.167 --> 1:18:54.917
Get yourself a brandy.

1:18:56.167 --> 1:18:58.126
Where's my rucksack?
I'll swim ashore.

1:19:02.959 --> 1:19:04.709
I honestly didn't hear.

1:19:12.376 --> 1:19:15.417
If I'd known it would come to this
I wouldn't have hidden.

1:19:21.542 --> 1:19:23.251
You're just like him

1:19:24.834 --> 1:19:28.709
only half his age and twice as dumb.

1:19:29.417 --> 1:19:34.001
What do you know about life?
Just cafes, yachts and cars.

1:19:34.792 --> 1:19:37.001
Bet you've got a four-room apartment.

1:19:41.584 --> 1:19:44.542
- I suppose you live 4 students to a room.
- 6, actually.

1:19:45.084 --> 1:19:46.876
I've been through it myself.

1:19:48.001 --> 1:19:49.792
So has he.

1:19:53.334 --> 1:19:55.126
You're no better than him.

1:19:56.584 --> 1:19:58.334
He was just like you.

1:20:00.209 --> 1:20:02.917
And you want to be like him.
And you will be,

1:20:03.501 --> 1:20:05.251
if you've got the guts.

1:20:08.334 --> 1:20:11.751
6 to a room.
You want to sleep, they play cards.

1:20:12.376 --> 1:20:14.376
You want to study,
they douse the lights.

1:20:15.751 --> 1:20:19.501
Canteen lunches, cheap smokes.

1:20:21.459 --> 1:20:24.042
Kissing in the alley

1:20:24.542 --> 1:20:26.876
fingers so cold
you can't unbutton her blouse.

1:20:31.209 --> 1:20:33.792
Did I leave anything out?

1:20:34.376 --> 1:20:37.792
Parents dead, sister got TB?

1:20:38.417 --> 1:20:40.167
No...

1:20:42.542 --> 1:20:44.376
They're alive?

1:20:44.834 --> 1:20:47.334
Divorced. Both remarried.

1:20:48.667 --> 1:20:50.417
Any brothers or sisters?

1:20:54.792 --> 1:20:56.709
Your parents help you?

1:20:57.126 --> 1:20:58.876
Father does sometimes.

1:21:05.501 --> 1:21:08.084
Here.
You'll catch cold.

1:21:55.709 --> 1:21:57.417
You're just a child.

1:22:32.292 --> 1:22:33.667
I'm sorry.

1:22:34.042 --> 1:22:35.792
Don't be silly.

1:24:19.667 --> 1:24:21.334
It's Monday.

1:24:21.751 --> 1:24:24.001
Will there be any trucks?

1:24:24.459 --> 1:24:27.751
Plenty. Food trucks.

1:24:28.376 --> 1:24:30.709
Monday's the best day.

1:24:36.042 --> 1:24:38.167
Ready?

1:24:38.626 --> 1:24:40.917
Fend off?

1:24:41.417 --> 1:24:42.876
Yes.

1:24:47.501 --> 1:24:49.959
Aye, aye. Fend off.

1:28:51.792 --> 1:28:53.542
The wipers are gone.

1:28:53.917 --> 1:28:55.584
Didn't you hear me calling?

1:28:55.959 --> 1:28:57.751
When?

1:29:05.792 --> 1:29:07.501
I shouted.

1:29:16.751 --> 1:29:19.959
- Did you go to the police?
- Naked?

1:29:20.626 --> 1:29:22.917
I didn't have the car keys.

1:29:23.417 --> 1:29:25.167
You could have smashed a window.

1:29:27.917 --> 1:29:30.417
- Are we going home?
- No, to the police.

1:29:30.959 --> 1:29:32.667
About the wipers?

1:30:06.792 --> 1:30:08.584
Scared?

1:30:13.792 --> 1:30:14.876
No...

1:30:15.167 --> 1:30:17.167
- You are.
- I'm not.

1:30:18.876 --> 1:30:20.584
Aren't you?

1:30:23.084 --> 1:30:24.209
Yes.

1:30:24.501 --> 1:30:27.917
Don't go.
It's enough you're scared.

1:30:28.584 --> 1:30:30.334
You weren't responsible.

1:30:34.959 --> 1:30:38.584
He was behind the buoy.
He dived when I checked.

1:30:40.376 --> 1:30:43.542
You were gone when he showed up.
We shouted.

1:30:44.167 --> 1:30:46.917
How could I hear anything?

1:30:48.376 --> 1:30:50.126
It's all nonsense.

1:30:51.959 --> 1:30:56.084
You're making it up.
You think you can save my neck.

1:30:58.667 --> 1:31:01.417
You tell me a pack of lies.
I pretend to believe them

1:31:01.959 --> 1:31:04.792
then we read in the paper:

1:31:06.459 --> 1:31:09.501
"19-year-old Youth Missing."

1:31:11.376 --> 1:31:13.167
And we'll feel sick.

1:31:15.001 --> 1:31:18.001
You're the one who's making it up.

1:31:18.584 --> 1:31:22.209
I checked that boy.
He wasn't there.

1:31:24.376 --> 1:31:27.209
He's alive.
So much so, I cheated on you with him.

1:31:28.626 --> 1:31:31.376
I'm not scared, you are

1:31:31.959 --> 1:31:34.709
so much so, you're fantasising.

1:31:50.001 --> 1:31:52.709
POLICE STATION 5km

1:32:06.584 --> 1:32:11.209
By the way,
you never finished that story.

1:32:13.084 --> 1:32:14.584
Why have we stopped?

1:32:14.959 --> 1:32:21.209
I'd like to believe you,
but cheat on me with him? Bad joke.

1:32:22.709 --> 1:32:24.667
Sorry, I won't tell it again.

1:32:25.126 --> 1:32:26.876
It was all my fault...

1:32:27.292 --> 1:32:30.251
Why did that seaman
jump on broken glass?

1:32:32.917 --> 1:32:34.751
You didn't finish your story.

1:32:35.209 --> 1:32:36.584
What is it with you?

1:32:44.709 --> 1:32:46.376
Where are we going?

1:32:46.792 --> 1:32:48.501
He got overconfident.

1:32:51.459 --> 1:32:54.126
Did the trick once too often.

1:32:54.626 --> 1:33:00.042
He was a stoker.
Hard soles from walking on coke.

1:33:02.834 --> 1:33:06.292
Been ashore a year.
His feet had gone soft.

1:33:06.917 --> 1:33:08.959
He didn't realise.

1:33:09.376 --> 1:33:12.876
- Did he ever try it again?
- No idea what became of him.
