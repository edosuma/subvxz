01:30.618 --> 01:31.919
Blake.

01:32.987 --> 01:35.087
Blake.

01:35.089 --> 01:36.922
Sorry, Sarge.

01:36.924 --> 01:38.958
Pick a man.

01:38.960 --> 01:40.760
Bring your kit.

01:40.762 --> 01:42.695
Yes, Sarge.

02:04.052 --> 02:05.684
Don't dawdle.

02:05.686 --> 02:07.021
No, Sarge.

02:15.997 --> 02:17.997
Did they feed us?

02:17.999 --> 02:21.667
No. Just mail.

02:22.937 --> 02:24.637
Time for some tea!

02:24.639 --> 02:26.107
Tea's up!

02:41.055 --> 02:42.990
Myrtle's having puppies.

02:45.693 --> 02:47.126
You get anything?

02:47.128 --> 02:49.962
No.

02:49.964 --> 02:53.032
Oh, I'm bloody starving.
Aren't you?

02:53.034 --> 02:56.035
Thought we might get
some decent grub out here.

02:56.037 --> 02:59.006
It was the only reason I
decided against the priesthood.

03:04.745 --> 03:06.045
What you got there?

03:06.047 --> 03:07.880
Ham and bread.

03:07.882 --> 03:10.015
Where did you find that?

03:10.017 --> 03:12.051
I have my uses.

03:12.053 --> 03:14.086
Here.

03:18.726 --> 03:20.059
Ugh.

03:20.061 --> 03:22.027
Tastes like old shoe.

03:22.029 --> 03:23.463
Cheer up.

03:23.465 --> 03:26.732
This time next week,
it'll be chicken dinner.

03:26.734 --> 03:28.968
Not me.

03:28.970 --> 03:31.036
My leave got canceled.

03:31.038 --> 03:33.172
They say why?

03:33.174 --> 03:36.041
No idea.

03:36.043 --> 03:39.078
It's easier
not to go back at all.

03:41.182 --> 03:42.917
Coming through.

03:49.090 --> 03:50.789
Something's up.

03:50.791 --> 03:54.193
- Did you hear anything?
- No.

03:54.195 --> 03:57.763
Has to be the push, right?

03:57.765 --> 04:00.166
Ten bob says we're going up.

04:00.168 --> 04:02.301
I'm not taking that bet.

04:02.303 --> 04:04.203
Why? 'Cause you know I'm right?

04:04.205 --> 04:06.339
No. Because you haven't
got ten bob.

04:11.112 --> 04:13.746
In your own time, gentlemen.

04:13.748 --> 04:15.080
Is there any news, Sarge?

04:15.082 --> 04:17.183
- News of what?
- The big push.

04:17.185 --> 04:18.817
It was supposed to happen
weeks ago.

04:18.819 --> 04:20.520
They told us we'd be home
by Christmas.

04:20.522 --> 04:22.288
Yes, well, sorry to
disrupt your crowded schedule,

04:22.290 --> 04:24.823
Blake, but the brass hats
didn't fancy it in the snow.

04:24.825 --> 04:25.991
More's the pity, Sarge.

04:25.993 --> 04:27.159
I could've done with
some turkey.

04:27.161 --> 04:28.761
Well, I'll make sure

04:28.763 --> 04:30.896
to relay your displeasure
to command.

04:30.898 --> 04:32.532
So what's on
the cards, then, Sergeant?

04:32.534 --> 04:34.099
The Hun are up to something.

04:34.101 --> 04:35.834
Any idea what?

04:35.836 --> 04:38.773
No. But it's
about to ruin our weekend.

04:45.880 --> 04:47.213
Now, listen.

04:47.215 --> 04:51.016
Erinmore is inside,
so tidy yourselves up.

04:51.018 --> 04:52.318
Never know.

04:52.320 --> 04:55.921
Might be mentions in dispatches
for this one.

04:55.923 --> 04:57.858
If you don't bugger it up.

05:00.928 --> 05:03.130
Must be something big
if the general's here.

05:13.241 --> 05:15.943
Lance Corporals
Blake and Schofield, sir.

05:18.045 --> 05:20.012
Which one of you is Blake?

05:20.014 --> 05:21.847
Sir.

05:21.849 --> 05:24.984
You have a brother,
a lieutenant in the 2nd Devons?

05:24.986 --> 05:26.051
Yes, sir.

05:26.053 --> 05:28.120
- Joseph Blake. Is he...
- Alive.

05:28.122 --> 05:30.155
As far as I know.

05:30.157 --> 05:33.125
And with your help,
I'd like to keep it that way.

05:33.127 --> 05:35.027
Sanders tells me
you're good with maps.

05:35.029 --> 05:36.429
That true?

05:36.431 --> 05:38.998
Good enough, sir.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.001
So...

05:42.003 --> 05:44.937
we are here.

05:44.939 --> 05:48.240
The 2nd Devons
are advancing here.

05:48.242 --> 05:50.343
How long will it take you
to get there?

05:51.846 --> 05:53.245
I don't understand, sir.

05:53.247 --> 05:55.180
Sir, that land
is held by the Germans.

05:55.182 --> 05:57.316
Germans have gone.

05:57.318 --> 05:59.251
Don't get your hopes up.

05:59.253 --> 06:02.921
It appears to be
a strategic withdrawal.

06:02.923 --> 06:04.457
They seem to have
created a new line,

06:04.459 --> 06:07.259
nine miles back here
by the looks of it.

06:07.261 --> 06:10.863
Colonel Mackenzie
is in command of the 2nd.

06:10.865 --> 06:12.197
He sent word yesterday morning

06:12.199 --> 06:15.234
he was going after
the retreating Germans.

06:15.236 --> 06:17.437
He is convinced
he has them on the run.

06:17.439 --> 06:19.305
That if he can
break their lines now,

06:19.307 --> 06:22.207
he will turn the tide.

06:22.209 --> 06:23.976
He is wrong.

06:23.978 --> 06:26.979
Colonel Mackenzie
has not seen these aerials

06:26.981 --> 06:28.348
of the enemy's new line.

06:28.350 --> 06:30.217
Come around here, gentlemen.

06:32.253 --> 06:35.287
Three miles deep,
field fortifications, defenses,

06:35.289 --> 06:39.091
artillery the like of which
we've never seen before.

06:39.093 --> 06:40.993
The 2nd are due
to attack the line

06:40.995 --> 06:43.195
shortly after dawn tomorrow.

06:43.197 --> 06:45.365
They have no idea
what they're in for.

06:45.367 --> 06:47.199
And we can't warn them.

06:47.201 --> 06:51.236
As a parting gift, the enemy
cut all our telephone lines.

06:51.238 --> 06:54.306
Your orders are to get
to the 2nd at Croisilles Wood,

06:54.308 --> 06:57.976
one mile southeast
of the town of Ã‰coust.

06:57.978 --> 06:59.978
Deliver this
to Colonel Mackenzie.

06:59.980 --> 07:03.383
It is a direct order to call
off tomorrow morning's attack.

07:03.385 --> 07:06.285
If you don't,
it will be a massacre.

07:06.287 --> 07:08.220
We will lose two battalions...

07:08.222 --> 07:11.524
1,600 men,
your brother among them.

07:11.526 --> 07:13.992
You think you can
get there in time?

07:13.994 --> 07:15.027
Yes, sir.

07:15.029 --> 07:16.295
Any questions?

07:16.297 --> 07:18.163
- No, sir.
- Good.

07:18.165 --> 07:20.000
Over to you, Lieutenant.

07:22.404 --> 07:25.204
Supplies, gentlemen.

07:25.206 --> 07:30.142
Map, torches, grenades, and,
uh, a couple of little treats.

07:30.144 --> 07:31.511
Leave immediately.

07:31.513 --> 07:33.979
Take this trench west
up on Sauchiehall Street,

07:33.981 --> 07:36.148
then northwest on
Paradise Alley at the front.

07:36.150 --> 07:39.118
Continue along the front line
until you find the Yorks.

07:39.120 --> 07:40.953
Give this note
to Major Stevenson.

07:40.955 --> 07:43.288
He's holding the line at the
shortest span of no-man's-land.

07:43.290 --> 07:45.290
You'll cross there.

07:45.292 --> 07:46.992
It'll be daylight, sir.
They'll see us.

07:46.994 --> 07:48.328
There's no need
to be concerned.

07:48.330 --> 07:50.297
You should meet no resistance.

07:57.004 --> 08:00.305
Sir, is... is it just us?

08:00.307 --> 08:02.509
"Down to Gehenna
or up to the Throne,

08:02.511 --> 08:05.745
He travels the fastest
who travels alone."

08:05.747 --> 08:07.179
Wouldn't you say, Lieutenant?

08:07.181 --> 08:08.916
Yes, sir, I would.

08:10.985 --> 08:12.319
Good luck.

08:22.196 --> 08:24.397
Blake, let's talk about this
for a minute.

08:24.399 --> 08:26.366
Why?

08:33.240 --> 08:34.942
Blake.

08:41.282 --> 08:43.081
We just need to think about it.

08:43.083 --> 08:44.249
There's nothing to think about.

08:44.251 --> 08:45.385
It's my big brother.

08:45.387 --> 08:47.219
We should at least
wait until it's dark.

08:47.221 --> 08:48.621
Erinmore said
to leave immediately.

08:48.623 --> 08:51.089
Erinmore's
never seen no-man's-land.

08:51.091 --> 08:52.792
We won't make it ten yards.

08:52.794 --> 08:54.794
- If we just wait...
- You heard him.

08:54.796 --> 08:56.796
He said the Boche have gone.

08:56.798 --> 08:59.264
Is that why
he gave us grenades?

09:05.239 --> 09:06.974
Oy.

09:09.310 --> 09:11.176
Watch where you're going.

09:11.178 --> 09:12.445
Sorry.

09:21.255 --> 09:23.556
All I'm saying is that we wait.

09:23.558 --> 09:27.127
Yes, you would say that, 'cause
it's not your brother, is it?

09:29.397 --> 09:31.631
Look, the last time I was told
the Germans were gone,

09:31.633 --> 09:34.266
it didn't end well.

09:34.268 --> 09:36.471
You don't know, Blake.
You weren't there.

09:39.106 --> 09:41.441
Excuse me. Excuse me.

09:41.443 --> 09:43.010
Excuse me.

09:47.349 --> 09:49.349
You're going up the
down trench, you bloody idiot.

09:49.351 --> 09:51.285
Orders of the general, sir.

10:03.565 --> 10:06.432
All right.
Say the Boche have gone.

10:06.434 --> 10:08.434
Nine miles will take us,
what, six hours?

10:08.436 --> 10:10.168
Eight at the very most.

10:10.170 --> 10:12.170
So we've got time to wait
until the sun sets.

10:12.172 --> 10:13.606
- It's enemy territory.
- Otherwise, we'll be wide open.

10:13.608 --> 10:15.475
We've got no idea
what we're walking into.

10:15.477 --> 10:18.176
Blake, if we're not
clever about this,

10:18.178 --> 10:20.547
no one will
get to your brother.

10:20.549 --> 10:22.316
I will.

10:24.352 --> 10:26.454
We're here.
This is the front line.

10:29.123 --> 10:31.123
Now we need to find the Yorks.

11:15.704 --> 11:17.470
- Sorry, mate.
- Jesus!

11:17.472 --> 11:18.471
Watch who you're shoving.

11:18.473 --> 11:20.238
All right,
get out of the way, then.

11:20.240 --> 11:21.507
Hey, who the fuck
do you think you are,

11:21.509 --> 11:22.508
pushing wounded soldiers
around?!

11:22.510 --> 11:23.776
Let go! Let go of me!

11:23.778 --> 11:25.378
Arsehole knocked down
our sergeant!

11:25.380 --> 11:26.379
The man's fucking wounded!

11:26.381 --> 11:28.381
All right, I'm sorry.
All right? I'm sorry!

11:28.383 --> 11:29.582
- We're on commission.
- Just let me through.

11:29.584 --> 11:33.251
- Orders from the general.
- Just let me through.

11:33.253 --> 11:36.188
Get out of the way.

11:36.190 --> 11:37.457
Fine.

11:37.459 --> 11:39.257
Just watch where you're going.

11:56.444 --> 11:57.679
Yorks.

12:08.390 --> 12:10.590
It's bloody quiet.

12:10.592 --> 12:13.326
Was it like this
before Thiepval?

12:13.328 --> 12:15.293
Don't remember.

12:15.295 --> 12:17.262
You don't remember the Somme?

12:17.264 --> 12:18.598
- Not really.
- Hey, mind us.

12:18.600 --> 12:20.300
Come on.

12:21.703 --> 12:24.504
Well, you did all right
out of it.

12:24.506 --> 12:26.839
At least wear your ribbon.

12:26.841 --> 12:29.442
Don't have it anymore.

12:29.444 --> 12:31.811
What? You lost your medal?

12:31.813 --> 12:34.514
Heads down, boys.

12:34.516 --> 12:37.317
Come on, lads. Keep digging.

12:40.722 --> 12:42.424
Stay low.

12:49.263 --> 12:50.630
For God's sake. Careful there.

12:50.632 --> 12:52.465
You're stepping on the dead.

12:52.467 --> 12:54.333
That's our sergeant.

12:54.335 --> 12:56.636
Be better washing them out of
this dugout with a bloody hose.

12:56.638 --> 12:58.438
Do you know
where the Yorks are?

12:58.440 --> 12:59.372
The next bend,

12:59.374 --> 13:01.273
you'll be standing
on top of half of them.

13:01.275 --> 13:02.809
Shot to hell two nights ago.

13:11.886 --> 13:14.620
- Yorks?
- Yes, Corp.

13:14.622 --> 13:16.456
Where's Major Stevenson?

13:16.458 --> 13:19.492
He was killed,
couple of nights ago, Corporal.

13:19.494 --> 13:21.494
Lieutenant Leslie has command.

13:21.496 --> 13:23.396
Where can we find him?

13:23.398 --> 13:25.398
Next dugout.

13:32.407 --> 13:33.641
Here.

13:38.747 --> 13:40.480
Sir?

13:40.482 --> 13:42.682
- Lieutenant Leslie, sir?
- What is it?

13:42.684 --> 13:44.584
We have a message
from General Erinmore.

13:44.586 --> 13:46.452
- Are you our relief?
- No, sir.

13:46.454 --> 13:48.488
Well, when the fucking hell
are they due?

13:48.490 --> 13:50.890
We don't know, sir, but we've
got orders to cross here.

13:50.892 --> 13:52.692
That is the German front line.

13:52.694 --> 13:54.393
We know, sir.

13:54.395 --> 13:56.364
If you'll just take the letter.

13:58.399 --> 14:00.833
Settle a bet.
What day is it?

14:00.835 --> 14:02.735
- Friday.
- Friday. Well, well, well.

14:02.737 --> 14:03.903
None of us was right.

14:03.905 --> 14:05.705
This idiot thought
it was Tuesday.

14:05.707 --> 14:08.474
Sorry, sir.

14:08.476 --> 14:10.676
Are they out of
their fucking minds?

14:10.678 --> 14:13.746
One slow night, the brass think
the Hun have just gone home.

14:13.748 --> 14:16.682
Do you think
they're wrong, sir?

14:16.684 --> 14:18.951
We lost an officer
and three men two nights ago.

14:18.953 --> 14:20.820
They were shot to bits
patching up wire.

14:20.822 --> 14:23.723
We dragged two of them
back here. Needn't bothered.

14:23.725 --> 14:26.893
Sir, the general is sure
the enemy have withdrawn.

14:26.895 --> 14:28.694
There are aerials
of the new line that...

14:28.696 --> 14:29.862
Shut up.
We fought and died

14:29.864 --> 14:31.697
over every inch
of this fucking place.

14:31.699 --> 14:33.366
Now they suddenly
give us miles?

14:33.368 --> 14:35.302
It's a trap.

14:37.872 --> 14:40.139
But chin up. There's a medal
in it, for sure.

14:40.141 --> 14:43.310
Nothing like a scrap of ribbon
to cheer up a widow.

14:45.747 --> 14:47.446
All right.

14:49.851 --> 14:51.651
Where's the nearest
way through, sir?

14:51.653 --> 14:54.687
Our wire's a mess, but there is
a path through of sorts.

14:54.689 --> 14:56.823
Rushworth, let him look.

15:01.763 --> 15:03.863
Straight ahead to the left,
past the dead horses.

15:03.865 --> 15:06.732
There's a gap
directly behind them.

15:06.734 --> 15:09.702
Useful, because if it's dark,
you follow the stench.

15:09.704 --> 15:11.604
When you get
to the second wire,

15:11.606 --> 15:13.606
look out for the bowing chap.

15:13.608 --> 15:15.641
There's a small break
just beside him.

15:15.643 --> 15:18.945
The German line is
150-odd yards after that.

15:18.947 --> 15:21.781
Watch out for the craters;
they're deeper than they look.

15:21.783 --> 15:23.883
You fall in,
there's no getting out.

15:23.885 --> 15:24.953
This way.

15:27.021 --> 15:28.754
Wake up, Kilgour.

15:28.756 --> 15:30.022
Bloody waste of space.

15:30.024 --> 15:32.425
Any cover, sir?
Anywhere to jump off from?

15:32.427 --> 15:34.594
No, the sap trench
was blown to hell weeks ago.

15:34.596 --> 15:35.862
It was full of bodies anyway.

15:35.864 --> 15:38.566
Your best bet
is to pop over here.

15:41.603 --> 15:44.570
If you do get shot, try to
make it back to the wire.

15:44.572 --> 15:46.505
We won't come after you,
not till it's dark.

15:46.507 --> 15:49.542
And if by some fucking miracle
you do make it,

15:49.544 --> 15:50.676
send up a flare.

15:50.678 --> 15:52.712
Don't have any, sir.

15:52.714 --> 15:54.847
Well, get him one, Kilgour.
Make yourself useful.

15:54.849 --> 15:56.449
Yes, sir.

15:59.520 --> 16:01.020
Through this holy unction,

16:01.022 --> 16:02.722
may the Lord
pardon you your faults

16:02.724 --> 16:04.792
and whatever sins
thou has committed.

16:07.795 --> 16:09.896
I do hate losing these
to the Hun,

16:09.898 --> 16:12.498
so when they start
shooting at you,

16:12.500 --> 16:14.567
could you be so kind
as to throw it back?

16:14.569 --> 16:15.937
There's a good chap.

16:18.907 --> 16:20.907
Cheerio.

16:27.815 --> 16:29.882
You sure?

16:29.884 --> 16:31.786
Yes.

16:37.759 --> 16:39.694
Age before beauty.

18:26.701 --> 18:28.069
You all right?

18:30.671 --> 18:32.006
Look for cover.

18:53.895 --> 18:55.596
Sap trench.

20:22.884 --> 20:24.750
Stay still.

20:32.894 --> 20:35.828
They're ours.

20:35.830 --> 20:37.932
Keep going. We're halfway.

21:42.331 --> 21:44.265
There's a gap, in the wire.

22:42.391 --> 22:44.326
Sco.

23:07.948 --> 23:10.082
There. That's the front line.

23:35.377 --> 23:37.309
Fuck me.

23:37.311 --> 23:39.013
They really have gone.

24:00.134 --> 24:03.135
Your hand all right?

24:03.137 --> 24:06.406
Put it through
an effing German.

24:06.408 --> 24:08.173
Patch it up.

24:08.175 --> 24:11.378
You'll be wanking again
in no time.

24:11.380 --> 24:13.314
Wrong hand.

24:43.244 --> 24:45.244
They're not long gone.

25:08.269 --> 25:09.970
No good.

25:32.059 --> 25:34.059
Blocked.

25:34.061 --> 25:35.996
This might be a way through.

25:51.278 --> 25:52.980
Jesus.

26:01.121 --> 26:03.556
Look at this.

26:03.558 --> 26:05.259
It's massive.

26:08.229 --> 26:10.164
They built all this.

26:56.444 --> 26:58.310
Here's our way through.

26:58.312 --> 27:00.613
Sco.

27:00.615 --> 27:02.247
How about this?

27:07.121 --> 27:08.456
Bloody hell.

27:11.393 --> 27:13.328
Even their rats
are bigger than ours.

27:20.402 --> 27:23.369
What do you think's
in the bags?

27:23.371 --> 27:25.340
You cannot be that hungry.

27:31.379 --> 27:35.314
Look at him,
cocky little bastard.

27:35.316 --> 27:37.215
You could eat this, though.

27:37.217 --> 27:39.454
- What is it?
- Boche dog meat.

27:41.489 --> 27:43.458
What's in the other boxes?

27:45.493 --> 27:48.595
- What's wrong?
- Trip wire.

27:48.597 --> 27:50.763
Don't move.

27:50.765 --> 27:52.534
Where is it?

27:54.603 --> 27:56.538
Goes from here to the door.

27:59.341 --> 28:00.506
Oh, Jesus!

28:00.508 --> 28:02.109
Oh, no.

28:12.252 --> 28:13.453
Sco!

28:19.527 --> 28:21.527
Sco?

28:24.799 --> 28:26.666
Sco!

28:28.970 --> 28:31.303
Sco! Sco.

28:37.746 --> 28:41.246
Sco! Sco.

28:43.418 --> 28:44.651
Sco.

28:44.653 --> 28:47.453
Sco! Wake up!

28:47.455 --> 28:48.621
Wake up!

28:50.992 --> 28:52.525
Sco! Sco!

28:54.696 --> 28:57.295
Stand up! Stand up!

28:57.297 --> 28:59.832
Come on. Stand up!

28:59.834 --> 29:03.403
Up! Up! Up!

29:03.405 --> 29:04.704
Come on!

29:04.706 --> 29:07.373
Stand up!

29:10.512 --> 29:11.811
The whole thing's coming down!

29:11.813 --> 29:13.646
Come on.

29:18.553 --> 29:20.653
You keep hold of me!

29:33.735 --> 29:35.635
We need to keep moving!

29:35.637 --> 29:37.036
Come on!

29:37.038 --> 29:40.305
I can't see. I can't see!

29:40.307 --> 29:42.341
Oh! Stop, stop, stop, stop!

29:42.343 --> 29:43.543
Stop!

29:43.545 --> 29:45.778
It's a mine shaft!

29:45.780 --> 29:47.847
Right, we'll have to jump.

29:47.849 --> 29:49.216
Come on!

29:52.286 --> 29:53.553
You're going to have to jump.

29:53.555 --> 29:55.320
- Just jump!
- I can't.

29:55.322 --> 29:57.557
- I can't see!
- You need to trust me.

29:57.559 --> 30:00.460
Jump!

30:05.467 --> 30:08.403
Don't let go of me!
Don't let go!

30:11.573 --> 30:13.840
Light. There's light.

30:25.487 --> 30:28.454
Stop. Stop.

30:28.456 --> 30:29.722
Just let me stand.

30:32.827 --> 30:34.796
Dirty bastards!

30:41.402 --> 30:44.403
Careful. They may have
left other traps.

30:51.880 --> 30:53.448
Jesus.

31:04.425 --> 31:05.691
Dust.

31:05.693 --> 31:07.760
So much dust in my eyes.

31:16.571 --> 31:18.137
Here.

31:18.139 --> 31:20.307
Have some of mine.

31:25.780 --> 31:28.781
I wish I'd shot that rat now.

31:28.783 --> 31:31.784
I wish you picked
some other bloody idiot.

31:31.786 --> 31:35.388
- What?
- Why in God's name did you have to choose me?

31:35.390 --> 31:37.523
Well, I didn't know
what I was picking you for.

31:37.525 --> 31:38.925
No, you didn't.

31:38.927 --> 31:41.629
You never know.
That's your problem.

31:44.899 --> 31:47.533
All right, then, go back.

31:47.535 --> 31:48.734
Nothing's stopping you.

31:48.736 --> 31:51.704
- You can go all the way bloody home if you want.
- Don't.

31:51.706 --> 31:54.674
Just don't.

31:54.676 --> 31:56.876
I-I didn't know
what I was picking you for.

31:56.878 --> 31:59.579
I thought they were going to
send us back up the line

31:59.581 --> 32:01.948
or for food or something.

32:01.950 --> 32:04.617
I thought it was going to be
something easy.

32:04.619 --> 32:07.186
All right?

32:07.188 --> 32:09.357
I never thought
it would be this.

32:15.797 --> 32:17.565
So do you want to go back?

32:21.636 --> 32:23.571
Just fire the fucking flare.

32:38.720 --> 32:39.921
Up yours, Lieutenant.

32:56.037 --> 32:58.406
Do you know where we are?

33:00.742 --> 33:03.876
Ã‰coust is directly southeast.

33:03.878 --> 33:08.449
And if we keep that bearing,
we should make it.

33:12.520 --> 33:13.920
Come on, then.

33:38.680 --> 33:40.579
Look at that.

33:40.581 --> 33:43.549
They destroyed their own guns.

33:43.551 --> 33:46.752
They destroyed
their own trenches, too.

33:46.754 --> 33:48.688
What do you mean?

33:48.690 --> 33:50.990
I think they wanted us
to go that way.

33:50.992 --> 33:52.961
They wanted to bury us.

33:59.934 --> 34:02.503
You bastard rats.

34:09.143 --> 34:10.876
Hey.

34:10.878 --> 34:13.112
Did you hear that story
about Wilko?

34:13.114 --> 34:15.982
- How he lost his ear.
- I'm not in the mood.

34:15.984 --> 34:17.750
Keep your eyes on the trees.

34:17.752 --> 34:19.721
Top of the ridge.

34:22.590 --> 34:24.525
Bet he told you
it was shrapnel.

34:26.094 --> 34:28.728
What was it, then?

34:28.730 --> 34:32.798
Well, you know his girl's
a hairdresser, right?

34:32.800 --> 34:35.134
And he was moaning about
the lack of bathing facilities

34:35.136 --> 34:37.337
when he wrote to her.

34:37.339 --> 34:39.071
Remember those
rancid jakes at Arras?

34:39.073 --> 34:40.706
Yeah.

34:40.708 --> 34:45.011
Anyway, she sends him over
this hair oil.

34:45.013 --> 34:48.016
Smells sweet.
Like Golden Syrup.

34:50.051 --> 34:52.985
Wilko loves the smell,

34:52.987 --> 34:56.655
but he doesn't want
to cart it around in his pack.

34:56.657 --> 35:02.128
So he slathers it all over
his barnet, goes to sleep.

35:02.130 --> 35:04.997
And in the middle of the night,
he wakes up,

35:04.999 --> 35:08.901
and a rat is sitting
on his shoulder,

35:08.903 --> 35:11.203
licking the oil off his head.

35:11.205 --> 35:14.040
Wilko panics, and he jumps up.

35:14.042 --> 35:17.743
And when he does, the rat bites
clean through his fucking ear

35:17.745 --> 35:19.812
- and runs off with it.
- No.

35:19.814 --> 35:22.014
Oh, he made a hell of a fuss...

35:22.016 --> 35:24.650
yelling, screaming.

35:24.652 --> 35:27.987
The best of it was he put
so much bloody oil on himself

35:27.989 --> 35:29.722
that he couldn't wash it off.

35:29.724 --> 35:30.990
He was like a magnet.

35:30.992 --> 35:32.725
The rats left us alone,

35:32.727 --> 35:34.660
but they couldn't get
enough of him.

35:34.662 --> 35:36.662
Poor bastard.

35:43.037 --> 35:45.704
Heading back home.

35:45.706 --> 35:49.175
I wonder what they saw.

35:49.177 --> 35:51.112
Watch the ridgelines.

35:55.817 --> 35:58.984
Well, that's your medal
sorted, then.

35:58.986 --> 36:00.986
What do you mean?

36:00.988 --> 36:02.955
"Lance Corporal Blake
showed unusual valor

36:02.957 --> 36:05.658
rescuing a comrade
from certain death."

36:05.660 --> 36:08.428
Blah, blah, blah.

36:08.430 --> 36:10.663
You reckon?

36:10.665 --> 36:11.999
I do.

36:14.702 --> 36:16.135
Well, that'd be nice.

36:16.137 --> 36:18.003
Since you lost yours.

36:18.005 --> 36:20.973
I didn't lose mine.

36:20.975 --> 36:22.842
What happened to it, then?

36:22.844 --> 36:25.780
- Why do you care?
- Why do you not?

36:27.849 --> 36:30.082
I swapped it
with a French captain.

36:30.084 --> 36:32.084
- Swapped it?
- Mm-hmm.

36:32.086 --> 36:33.819
For what?

36:33.821 --> 36:35.955
Bottle of wine.

36:35.957 --> 36:37.857
Well, what did you do that for?

36:37.859 --> 36:39.060
I was thirsty.

36:40.995 --> 36:42.763
What a waste.

36:44.799 --> 36:46.765
You should've
taken it home with you.

36:46.767 --> 36:49.237
You should've given it
to your family.

36:51.739 --> 36:54.206
Men have died for that.

36:54.208 --> 36:56.476
If I got a medal,
I'd take it back home.

36:56.478 --> 36:58.010
Why didn't you just
take it home?

36:58.012 --> 37:00.112
Look, it's just
a bit of bloody tin.

37:00.114 --> 37:01.947
It doesn't make you special.

37:01.949 --> 37:04.950
Doesn't make
any difference to anyone.

37:04.952 --> 37:06.986
Yes, it does.

37:06.988 --> 37:08.888
And it's not just a bit of tin.

37:08.890 --> 37:11.092
It's got a ribbon on it.

37:15.196 --> 37:17.196
I hated going home.

37:17.198 --> 37:19.066
I hated it.

37:21.102 --> 37:23.969
When I knew I couldn't stay,

37:23.971 --> 37:26.941
when I knew I had to leave
and they might never see...

37:57.972 --> 37:59.207
Jesus.

38:02.143 --> 38:04.111
They chopped them all down.

38:08.015 --> 38:09.717
Cherries.

38:13.087 --> 38:14.889
Lamberts.

38:17.992 --> 38:20.059
They might be dukes.

38:20.061 --> 38:22.995
Hard to tell
when they aren't in fruit.

38:22.997 --> 38:25.264
What's the difference?

38:25.266 --> 38:28.133
Well, people think
there's one type.

38:28.135 --> 38:29.802
But there's lots of them.

38:29.804 --> 38:32.071
Cuthberts, Queen Annes,
Montmorencys,

38:32.073 --> 38:33.973
sweet ones, sour ones.

38:33.975 --> 38:36.343
Why on earth
would you know this?

38:36.345 --> 38:39.011
Mum's got an orchard back home.

38:39.013 --> 38:41.348
Only a few trees.

38:41.350 --> 38:44.817
This time of year, it looks
like it's been snowing.

38:44.819 --> 38:47.420
Blossom everywhere.

38:47.422 --> 38:51.023
And then in May,
we have to pick them.

38:51.025 --> 38:52.260
Me and Joe.

38:54.295 --> 38:56.862
Takes the whole day.

38:56.864 --> 38:59.231
So these ones are all goners?

38:59.233 --> 39:00.966
Oh, no.

39:00.968 --> 39:03.302
They'll grow again
when the stones rot.

39:03.304 --> 39:05.239
You'll end up with
more trees than before.

39:11.145 --> 39:12.945
It looks abandoned.

39:12.947 --> 39:15.180
Let's hope so.

39:15.182 --> 39:17.051
We have to make sure.

39:49.351 --> 39:51.420
I'll take front. You take back.

40:34.128 --> 40:36.128
Anything?

40:36.130 --> 40:37.865
Nothing.

40:56.117 --> 40:58.353
- Did you find any food?
- No.

41:00.221 --> 41:02.156
I don't like this place.

42:09.791 --> 42:13.460
Map says get over that ridge,

42:13.462 --> 42:17.095
and it's a straight shot
to Ã‰coust.

42:17.097 --> 42:18.567
Good.

43:02.477 --> 43:05.143
Is that our friends again?

43:05.145 --> 43:07.447
Looks like it.

43:07.449 --> 43:10.249
Dogfight.

43:10.251 --> 43:12.284
Who's winning?

43:12.286 --> 43:14.420
Us, I think.

43:14.422 --> 43:16.156
Two on one.

43:19.427 --> 43:21.363
They got him.

44:19.186 --> 44:20.720
We should put him
out of his misery.

44:20.722 --> 44:22.657
No. Get him some water.
He needs water.

44:24.559 --> 44:27.225
It's all right.
It's all right. Steady.

44:27.227 --> 44:30.197
- St-Steady. Stay still.
- <i>Nein.</i>

44:38.373 --> 44:40.640
Stop. Stop!

44:40.642 --> 44:42.575
No, no, no!

44:46.381 --> 44:48.481
No!

44:48.483 --> 44:50.215
You bastard!

44:51.519 --> 44:53.553
You bloody bastard.

44:56.958 --> 44:58.391
Oh.

44:58.393 --> 44:59.626
- Oh, God, no.
- Oh.

44:59.628 --> 45:01.226
My God, no!

45:02.597 --> 45:05.365
Jes... Jesus, no!

45:05.367 --> 45:07.265
- Oh, Je...
- We have to stop the bleeding.

45:07.267 --> 45:09.402
Stop! Stop it! Stop it!

45:09.404 --> 45:11.404
It's all right. It's all right.
It's going to be all right.

45:11.406 --> 45:12.605
Ow.

45:12.607 --> 45:14.474
We're going to stand up.

45:14.476 --> 45:16.376
- Yes. Yes.
- Right?

45:16.378 --> 45:18.312
Okay.

45:20.515 --> 45:22.348
No! I can't. I can't.

45:22.350 --> 45:24.417
Ow!

45:24.419 --> 45:26.552
- We have to get to an aid post.
- I can't!

45:26.554 --> 45:28.253
I'll carry you.
It isn't very far.

45:28.255 --> 45:29.622
Just bring a doctor here.

45:29.624 --> 45:31.557
We can't.
We have to go together.

45:33.227 --> 45:36.329
We're going to get up.
We're going to get up.

45:42.404 --> 45:44.236
Stop.

45:44.238 --> 45:45.705
Please stop!

45:45.707 --> 45:47.006
Put me down!

45:47.008 --> 45:48.574
Put me down, you bastard!

45:48.576 --> 45:50.610
Please! Put me down!

46:01.288 --> 46:02.855
You have to try to keep moving.

46:02.857 --> 46:04.557
Let's just sit.

46:04.559 --> 46:06.426
- Let me sit.
- No, we can't.

46:06.428 --> 46:08.361
We have to find the 2nd,
remember?

46:08.363 --> 46:09.729
Your brother.
We have to go now.

46:09.731 --> 46:11.664
You can start on without me.
I'll catch up.

46:11.666 --> 46:12.665
No.

46:12.667 --> 46:14.634
You can't stay here.

46:14.636 --> 46:16.769
We have to move.
All right?

46:16.771 --> 46:18.404
We have to move.

46:18.406 --> 46:20.305
Come on. Come on!

46:20.307 --> 46:22.341
Come on.

46:22.343 --> 46:24.276
That's it. Come on.

46:24.278 --> 46:27.647
Come on. Come on.

46:31.853 --> 46:33.352
Your brother.

46:33.354 --> 46:35.354
We have to find your brother.

46:37.625 --> 46:40.626
You'll recognize him.

46:40.628 --> 46:42.595
He looks like me.

46:42.597 --> 46:45.064
And he's a bit older.

46:57.846 --> 46:59.647
What are they?

47:01.716 --> 47:04.717
Are we being shelled?

47:04.719 --> 47:06.352
They're embers.

47:06.354 --> 47:08.288
The barn is on fire.

47:12.393 --> 47:13.728
I've been hit.

47:15.797 --> 47:18.531
What was it?

47:18.533 --> 47:20.267
You were stabbed.

47:25.707 --> 47:27.675
Am I dying?

47:35.884 --> 47:38.818
Yes.

47:38.820 --> 47:40.755
Yes, I think you are.

47:44.759 --> 47:48.494
Oh. No. No.

47:57.672 --> 47:59.138
This?

47:59.140 --> 48:00.773
Inside.

48:24.566 --> 48:27.934
Will you write
to my mum for me?

48:27.936 --> 48:29.637
I will.

48:32.473 --> 48:34.473
Tell her I wasn't scared.

48:37.979 --> 48:40.179
Anything else?

48:41.983 --> 48:43.818
I love them.

48:45.887 --> 48:47.655
I wish that...

48:49.724 --> 48:51.659
I wish that...

48:57.198 --> 48:58.766
Talk to me.

49:01.002 --> 49:02.937
Tell me you know the way.

49:06.541 --> 49:09.542
I know the way.

49:09.544 --> 49:12.912
I'm going to head southeast
until I hit Ã‰coust.

49:12.914 --> 49:15.882
I'll pass through the town
and out to the east,

49:15.884 --> 49:18.584
all the way to Croisilles Wood.

49:18.586 --> 49:21.053
It'll be dark by then.

49:21.055 --> 49:23.689
That won't bother me.

49:23.691 --> 49:25.691
I'll find the 2nd,

49:25.693 --> 49:27.760
I'll give them the message,

49:27.762 --> 49:30.029
and then I'll find
your brother.

49:30.031 --> 49:31.831
Just like you.

49:31.833 --> 49:33.801
A little older.

51:36.024 --> 51:38.924
You all right, mate?

51:38.926 --> 51:41.861
Hey, it's all right.
It's okay.

51:41.863 --> 51:43.698
Come on, help him.

51:52.774 --> 51:56.942
Jesus. What happened to him?

51:56.944 --> 51:58.677
Was it the plane?

51:58.679 --> 52:00.882
- We saw the smoke.
- Yeah.

52:17.932 --> 52:19.799
Go and fetch his things.

52:19.801 --> 52:21.636
- Sir.
- Sir.

52:25.073 --> 52:26.774
A friend?

52:29.710 --> 52:31.844
What are you doing here?

52:31.846 --> 52:34.680
I have an urgent message
for the 2nd Devons.

52:34.682 --> 52:37.083
Orders to stop
tomorrow morning's attack.

52:37.085 --> 52:38.984
And where are they stationed?

52:38.986 --> 52:41.421
Just beyond Ã‰coust.

52:41.423 --> 52:42.990
Come with me.

52:49.097 --> 52:51.864
Come with me, Corporal.
It's an order.

52:51.866 --> 52:52.998
We're passing through Ã‰coust.

52:53.000 --> 52:54.936
We can take you
some of the way.

52:56.871 --> 52:58.072
Sir.

53:23.131 --> 53:24.864
Oh, come on, Sergeant!

53:24.866 --> 53:27.133
Put more men on the base.

53:27.135 --> 53:29.969
At the trunk.
It'll be heavier there.

53:29.971 --> 53:31.837
Might be a tight squeeze.

53:31.839 --> 53:34.173
No, you're not going
to be able to just lift it.

53:34.175 --> 53:36.775
Pivot the front end
to the left.

53:36.777 --> 53:39.078
Jesus, they don't
make things easy, do they?

53:39.080 --> 53:41.914
They could at least have
retreated with a bit of grace.

53:41.916 --> 53:43.015
Bastards!

53:43.017 --> 53:44.783
Sir.

53:44.785 --> 53:46.785
- You're not one of mine.
- No, sir.

53:46.787 --> 53:49.255
He has an urgent message to
deliver to the 2nd Devons, sir.

53:49.257 --> 53:50.856
Can you get past it?

53:50.858 --> 53:52.325
- No, sir.
- Oh, for God's sake.

53:52.327 --> 53:54.793
Just move it!

53:54.795 --> 53:57.296
There's room
in the casuals' truck, sir.

53:57.298 --> 53:59.798
- He has orders.
- Yes, yes, all right.

53:59.800 --> 54:02.801
Come on, now. You can
get through there sideways.

54:07.041 --> 54:09.041
How did you get here, sir?

54:09.043 --> 54:12.811
Crossed no-man's-land,
just outside Bapaume.

54:12.813 --> 54:14.280
Took us the whole night.

54:14.282 --> 54:16.782
Bumped into a couple of
Hun stragglers on the way

54:16.784 --> 54:18.984
who made a nuisance
of themselves.

54:18.986 --> 54:20.819
You're going up
to the new line?

54:20.821 --> 54:22.288
Attempting to.

54:22.290 --> 54:24.023
The Newfoundlands
have pushed forwards

54:24.025 --> 54:25.960
and requested reinforcements.

54:28.029 --> 54:31.096
I'm sorry about your friend.

54:31.098 --> 54:33.935
May I tell you something
that you probably already know?

54:35.970 --> 54:38.971
It doesn't do to dwell on it.

54:38.973 --> 54:40.940
No, sir.

54:40.942 --> 54:42.208
Hop on.

54:44.045 --> 54:45.880
Make some space there.

54:47.848 --> 54:49.915
Come on, in you get.

55:05.866 --> 55:08.736
All right.
Here we go again, boys.

55:11.138 --> 55:14.742
Welcome aboard the night bus
to fuck-knows-where.

55:18.079 --> 55:21.247
Is that a dead dog?

55:21.249 --> 55:23.249
- You got a fag?
- Yeah. There you go.

55:39.934 --> 55:41.300
- Butler.
- Oy.

55:41.302 --> 55:44.103
- Carry on with that story.
- Oh, yeah. Right.

55:44.105 --> 55:48.240
So, when we get off the train,
Beaufoy comes up to us,

55:48.242 --> 55:50.909
and he's having a right go.

55:50.911 --> 55:52.878
"Lance Corporal,
whatever one does,

55:52.880 --> 55:54.347
one never lets standards slip."

55:54.349 --> 55:56.215
Then Scott comes
out the latrine.

55:56.217 --> 55:58.984
He wipes his hand on the back
of Beaufoy's jacket.

55:58.986 --> 56:01.253
Shit all down his back.

56:01.255 --> 56:02.955
Was that meant to be
Captain Beaufoy?

56:02.957 --> 56:06.025
Oh, piss off, you.
You can't do any better.

56:06.027 --> 56:07.627
"Men, your rifle stocks are

56:07.629 --> 56:10.195
an embarrassment to the entire
Expeditionary Force."

56:10.197 --> 56:11.464
- Nah.
- No.

56:11.466 --> 56:13.265
You're both bloody awful.

56:13.267 --> 56:15.934
You don't know. You barely even
speak the bloody language.

56:15.936 --> 56:17.936
He's got a better grasp
of it than you, Cooke.

56:17.938 --> 56:19.972
Well, go on, then, Jondalar.
Give it a go. Let's see it.

56:22.209 --> 56:26.011
"Rossi! Never in my 200 years
as a soldier

56:26.013 --> 56:28.448
have I seen such a sorry excuse
for a latrine pit."

56:28.450 --> 56:30.215
Shite.

56:30.217 --> 56:32.419
That is total shit.

56:32.421 --> 56:34.454
Oy. Could've taken
my teeth out with that.

56:34.456 --> 56:36.391
You could do with a new set.

56:41.430 --> 56:44.464
You got somewhere
you need to be?

56:46.000 --> 56:48.233
- No.
- Arsehole needs driving lessons.

57:04.051 --> 57:07.319
- He should reverse.
- Yeah.

57:07.321 --> 57:09.389
Try it in reverse.

57:09.391 --> 57:11.123
Reverse!

57:18.265 --> 57:19.332
No. Stop.

57:19.334 --> 57:21.166
Stop!

57:21.168 --> 57:23.436
- Everyone needs to get out.
- Who the fuck is he?

57:23.438 --> 57:26.339
All out!

57:26.341 --> 57:27.973
- Come on!
- All right.

57:27.975 --> 57:30.976
All right,
keep your bloody hair on.

57:30.978 --> 57:32.379
Right.

57:32.381 --> 57:35.214
One, two, three!

57:42.022 --> 57:44.189
We need to get some wood,
put it under the wheels.

57:44.191 --> 57:45.392
No, we haven't got the time.

57:45.394 --> 57:47.427
We all need to push.
Come on.

57:47.429 --> 57:48.994
Come on!

57:55.302 --> 57:57.537
Please. I have to go now.

57:57.539 --> 58:00.440
Please.

58:00.442 --> 58:02.174
All right, come on, lads.

58:02.176 --> 58:03.175
Come on.

58:03.177 --> 58:04.276
Come on, boys.

58:04.278 --> 58:07.279
One, two, three.

58:18.292 --> 58:20.460
Come on, boys!
One last push, yeah?!

58:20.462 --> 58:23.262
One, two, three!

58:35.544 --> 58:37.176
Back in.

58:37.178 --> 58:38.545
Get back in.

58:38.547 --> 58:40.480
Go.

58:40.482 --> 58:42.549
Are you all right?

58:42.551 --> 58:44.316
Here, driver, how about you try

58:44.318 --> 58:46.486
to keep it on the bloody road
for a change?

58:46.488 --> 58:48.220
Oh, piss off.

59:07.107 --> 59:10.209
So, where are you going?

59:10.211 --> 59:14.046
I have to get to the
2nd Devons, just past Ã‰coust.

59:14.048 --> 59:16.215
Why?

59:16.217 --> 59:17.817
They're attacking at dawn.

59:17.819 --> 59:19.519
I have orders to stop them.

59:19.521 --> 59:22.154
How come?

59:22.156 --> 59:24.122
They're walking into a trap.

59:24.124 --> 59:26.124
How many?

59:26.126 --> 59:27.327
Sixteen hundred.

59:27.329 --> 59:29.294
Ooh.

59:29.296 --> 59:30.998
Jesus.

59:33.067 --> 59:36.168
Why did they send you
on your own?

59:36.170 --> 59:37.570
They didn't.

59:37.572 --> 59:40.305
There were two of us.

59:40.307 --> 59:42.475
So now it's down to you?

59:42.477 --> 59:45.143
Yes.

59:45.145 --> 59:47.081
You'll never make it.

59:50.552 --> 59:52.487
Yes, I will.

59:58.560 --> 1:00:00.560
Thank you.

1:00:02.597 --> 1:00:04.564
Look at it.

1:00:04.566 --> 1:00:07.367
Fucking look at it.

1:00:07.369 --> 1:00:10.235
Three years fighting over this.

1:00:10.237 --> 1:00:13.205
We should've just let
the bastards keep it.

1:00:13.207 --> 1:00:15.140
I mean, who machine-guns cows?

1:00:15.142 --> 1:00:17.377
Huns with extra bullets.

1:00:17.379 --> 1:00:19.445
Bastards.

1:00:19.447 --> 1:00:21.280
Clever.

1:00:21.282 --> 1:00:25.585
They know if they don't shoot
the cow, you will eat it.

1:00:25.587 --> 1:00:27.286
Still bastards.

1:00:27.288 --> 1:00:29.689
Yeah, it's not even
our bloody country.

1:00:29.691 --> 1:00:31.624
How long gone
do you reckon they are?

1:00:31.626 --> 1:00:33.158
Why?

1:00:33.160 --> 1:00:34.527
Worried we'll catch up
with them?

1:00:34.529 --> 1:00:36.161
Yeah.

1:00:36.163 --> 1:00:38.364
Right. Be a bloody miracle
at this rate.

1:00:38.366 --> 1:00:40.600
Yeah, they're probably
right round the next corner.

1:00:40.602 --> 1:00:43.436
Piss off. No, they're not.

1:00:43.438 --> 1:00:46.138
Why don't they just
bloody well give up?

1:00:46.140 --> 1:00:48.741
Eh? Don't they want to go home?

1:00:48.743 --> 1:00:51.209
They hate
their wives and mothers.

1:00:51.211 --> 1:00:53.211
And Germany must be a shithole.

1:00:55.215 --> 1:00:56.583
They're retreating.

1:00:56.585 --> 1:00:58.418
They're miles back.

1:00:58.420 --> 1:01:01.219
Got 'em on the ropes, at least.

1:01:01.221 --> 1:01:04.591
No. We don't.

1:01:06.361 --> 1:01:08.226
Oh, bollocks.
What's up now?

1:01:08.228 --> 1:01:09.762
Not another bloody tree.

1:01:09.764 --> 1:01:11.364
Bridge is down.

1:01:11.366 --> 1:01:13.600
Oh. That's a shame.

1:01:13.602 --> 1:01:15.635
Looks like I'll be
getting out here.

1:01:15.637 --> 1:01:17.537
Good luck.

1:01:17.539 --> 1:01:19.372
Keep some of that luck
for yourself, pal.

1:01:19.374 --> 1:01:21.239
- Think you'll be needing it.
- Good luck, mate.

1:01:21.241 --> 1:01:22.508
- Good luck.
- Good luck, gov.

1:01:22.510 --> 1:01:24.644
- Good luck.
- Don't balls it up.

1:01:24.646 --> 1:01:27.547
I hope you get there.

1:01:27.549 --> 1:01:29.249
Thank you.

1:01:32.487 --> 1:01:34.286
The next bridge is six miles.

1:01:34.288 --> 1:01:35.655
We'll have to divert.

1:01:35.657 --> 1:01:37.357
I can't, sir.

1:01:37.359 --> 1:01:39.291
I don't have the time.

1:01:39.293 --> 1:01:42.294
Of course.

1:01:42.296 --> 1:01:44.364
Best of luck.

1:01:44.366 --> 1:01:45.700
Thank you, sir.

1:01:49.303 --> 1:01:51.337
Corporal?

1:01:51.339 --> 1:01:55.273
If you do manage to get
to Colonel Mackenzie,

1:01:55.275 --> 1:01:57.744
make sure there are witnesses.

1:01:57.746 --> 1:01:59.445
They are direct orders, sir.

1:01:59.447 --> 1:02:01.714
I know.

1:02:01.716 --> 1:02:04.350
But some men
just want the fight.

1:02:06.588 --> 1:02:08.288
Thank you, sir.

1:13:23.898 --> 1:13:25.966
O-Only me.

1:13:28.969 --> 1:13:31.970
I need to be somewhere.

1:13:31.972 --> 1:13:34.975
I need to find a wood
to the southeast.

1:13:37.044 --> 1:13:38.944

Who is her mother?

Raise your signal
flags or fire the signal flares

1:34:10.712 --> 1:34:13.346

of the Hun line.

called off the attack.

1:34:27.629 --> 1:34:29.629

Go and see the captain!

1:34:41.643 --> 1:34:43.376
Do you understand?!

1:34:43.378 --> 1:34:45.645
- Yes, sir!
- Two Mills bombs per man.

1:34:45.647 --> 1:34:48.246
NCOs collect flares
and signal flags.

1:34:48.248 --> 1:34:50.217
- Keep to your stations.
- Oy. Oy!

1:34:58.460 --> 1:35:01.527
Nine and ten section
at the ready!

1:35:01.529 --> 1:35:05.398
We will advance
on the first whistle blast.

1:35:05.400 --> 1:35:07.299
- 11 and 12...
- ...not slow down.

1:35:07.301 --> 1:35:09.602
The man next to you falls,
keep moving.

1:35:09.604 --> 1:35:11.638
Your orders are
to break the lines.

1:35:11.640 --> 1:35:13.271
Where is the captain?

1:35:13.273 --> 1:35:15.307
He's over there.

1:35:15.309 --> 1:35:16.576
Keep in your section formation.

1:35:16.578 --> 1:35:18.544
Sir! Sir!

1:35:18.546 --> 1:35:21.814
Captain, I have a message.

1:35:21.816 --> 1:35:23.816
This attack is called off.

You have to stop.
You have to stop!

1:35:30.324 --> 1:35:32.290
Where is Colonel Mackenzie?

1:35:32.292 --> 1:35:34.261
Where is Mackenzie?!

1:36:01.489 --> 1:36:03.255
Get back! Back!

1:36:03.257 --> 1:36:05.024
Return to your sections! Back!

1:36:05.026 --> 1:36:06.592
Hold fast!

1:36:06.594 --> 1:36:08.728
Seven Platoon, one minute!

1:36:08.730 --> 1:36:12.331
Sir, I have orders
to stop this attack!

1:36:12.333 --> 1:36:13.366
What?

1:36:13.368 --> 1:36:15.601
Where is Colonel Mackenzie?!

1:36:15.603 --> 1:36:17.570
He's further up the line.

1:36:17.572 --> 1:36:19.338
- How far?
- 300 yards.

1:36:19.340 --> 1:36:21.040
He's in a cut-and-cover.

1:36:21.042 --> 1:36:23.743
You'll have to wait until
the first wave goes over.

1:36:23.745 --> 1:36:25.680
No. No, I can't.

1:36:33.555 --> 1:36:36.758
Seven Platoon, 30 seconds!

1:36:48.737 --> 1:36:50.636
You can't possibly
make it that way, man.

1:36:50.638 --> 1:36:52.574
Are you bloody insane?

1:36:56.578 --> 1:36:59.345
What the hell are you doing,
Lance Corporal?

1:36:59.347 --> 1:37:01.416
No. No, no, no, no!

1:38:03.511 --> 1:38:05.711

1:38:05.713 --> 1:38:07.446
Get ready!

1:38:07.448 --> 1:38:09.684

1:38:11.452 --> 1:38:13.786
- Two minutes!
- Let me through!

1:38:13.788 --> 1:38:15.588
Hey. Hey!

1:38:15.590 --> 1:38:17.390
- Let me through!
- What the hell do you think you're doing?

1:38:17.392 --> 1:38:18.558
I have to get through!

1:38:18.560 --> 1:38:19.926
I have to see
Colonel Mackenzie.

1:38:19.928 --> 1:38:21.661
- What are you doing?
- I have to stop this attack.

1:38:21.663 --> 1:38:22.895
Colonel, we've seen flares.

1:38:22.897 --> 1:38:25.464
The men on the left flank have
made it to the German line.

1:38:25.466 --> 1:38:27.600
- Colonel! Colonel!
- Hold him. Hold him.

1:38:27.602 --> 1:38:29.836
Listen to me. Listen to me.
I have a letter.

1:38:29.838 --> 1:38:31.671
I need to see
Colonel Mackenzie!

1:38:31.673 --> 1:38:33.606
There's no bloody way
you're getting in there, mate.

1:38:33.608 --> 1:38:34.740
Sergeant, send the next wave.

1:38:34.742 --> 1:38:36.409
No!

1:38:36.411 --> 1:38:38.511
Second wave,
prepare yourselves!

1:38:38.513 --> 1:38:40.513
- Colonel Mackenzie!
- Concentrate everything there.

1:38:40.515 --> 1:38:42.615
This attack is not to go ahead!

1:38:42.617 --> 1:38:45.618
You have been ordered to stop.
You have to stop.

1:38:45.620 --> 1:38:47.486
Who the hell are you?

1:38:47.488 --> 1:38:49.755
Lance Corporal Schofield,
sir, 8th.

1:38:49.757 --> 1:38:51.490
I have orders from
General Erinmore

1:38:51.492 --> 1:38:52.625
to call off this attack.

1:38:52.627 --> 1:38:53.993
You're too late,
Lance Corporal.

1:38:53.995 --> 1:38:56.028
Sir, these orders
are from army command.

1:38:56.030 --> 1:38:57.630
You have to read them.

1:38:57.632 --> 1:38:59.432
Shall we hold back
the second wave, sir?

1:38:59.434 --> 1:39:00.733
No, Major.
Hesitate now, and we lose.

1:39:00.735 --> 1:39:02.501
Victory's only 500 yards away.

1:39:02.503 --> 1:39:04.437
Sir, please read the letter.

1:39:04.439 --> 1:39:07.440
I have heard it all before.

1:39:07.442 --> 1:39:09.508
I'm not going to wait
until dusk or for fog.

1:39:09.510 --> 1:39:10.810
I'm not calling back my men

1:39:10.812 --> 1:39:12.478
only to send them
out there again tomorrow,

1:39:12.480 --> 1:39:13.880
not when we've got
the bastards on the run.

1:39:13.882 --> 1:39:15.514
This is their last stand.

1:39:15.516 --> 1:39:17.950
The Germans planned this, sir.

1:39:17.952 --> 1:39:19.752
They've been planning it
for months.

1:39:19.754 --> 1:39:22.655
They want you to attack.

1:39:22.657 --> 1:39:24.592
Read the letter.

1:39:44.545 --> 1:39:46.514
- Major?
- Yes, sir?

1:39:48.816 --> 1:39:51.550
- Stand them down.
- Yes, sir.

1:39:51.552 --> 1:39:53.686
Call up the
orderlies. Tend the wounded.

1:39:53.688 --> 1:39:55.488
Hold the line
in case they counter.

1:39:55.490 --> 1:39:56.923
Yes, sir.

1:39:56.925 --> 1:40:00.526
Stand down! Stand down!

1:40:02.263 --> 1:40:03.596
Stand down!

1:40:05.733 --> 1:40:08.935
- Cease fire! Cease fire!
- Stand down!

1:40:12.974 --> 1:40:15.576
I hoped today might be
a good day.

1:40:17.845 --> 1:40:20.048
Hope is a dangerous thing.

1:40:21.783 --> 1:40:23.683
That's it for now,
and then next week,

1:40:23.685 --> 1:40:26.719
command will send
a different message.

1:40:26.721 --> 1:40:28.656
"Attack at dawn."

1:40:31.759 --> 1:40:33.861
There is only one way
this war ends.

1:40:36.297 --> 1:40:38.466
Last man standing.

1:40:43.738 --> 1:40:45.707
Have someone
see to your wounds.

1:40:48.609 --> 1:40:50.845
Now fuck off, Lance Corporal.

1:40:56.617 --> 1:40:57.817
Bearers!

1:40:57.819 --> 1:41:00.786
Stretcher bearers!

1:41:00.788 --> 1:41:02.555
Bearers!

1:41:02.557 --> 1:41:04.557
Stretcher bearers!

1:41:04.559 --> 1:41:06.959
Well done, lad.

1:41:06.961 --> 1:41:08.629
Thank you, sir.

1:41:10.698 --> 1:41:12.965
Do you know where
Lieutenant Blake is, sir?

1:41:12.967 --> 1:41:14.767
Blake?

1:41:14.769 --> 1:41:16.669
There were two of us.

1:41:16.671 --> 1:41:18.971
I was sent here
with his brother.

1:41:18.973 --> 1:41:21.040
Ah.

1:41:21.042 --> 1:41:22.842
Well, knowing Lieutenant Blake,

1:41:22.844 --> 1:41:24.777
he would have gone over
with his men.

1:41:24.779 --> 1:41:27.913
He was in the first wave.

1:41:27.915 --> 1:41:29.782
How could I find him, sir?

1:41:29.784 --> 1:41:31.984
You can try
the casualty clearing station

1:41:31.986 --> 1:41:34.854
behind the line.

1:41:34.856 --> 1:41:36.557
Otherwise...

1:41:39.627 --> 1:41:41.060
Thank you, sir.

1:41:41.062 --> 1:41:43.062
Major Hepburn, sir.

1:41:50.838 --> 1:41:52.807
- Keep moving. Keep moving.
- Nearly there.

1:42:03.618 --> 1:42:04.952
Ow!

1:42:07.655 --> 1:42:08.723
Will I make it?

1:42:11.025 --> 1:42:12.860
Will I make it?

1:42:17.065 --> 1:42:19.732
- Go the fuck up.
- Clear the way.

1:42:19.734 --> 1:42:21.167
Come on, quickly.

1:42:21.169 --> 1:42:23.169
Get a medic!

1:42:23.171 --> 1:42:26.707
Medic! Medic!

1:42:34.048 --> 1:42:35.147
Just keep moving.

1:42:35.149 --> 1:42:37.083
Keep moving, keep moving.

1:42:37.085 --> 1:42:38.851
That's it.

1:43:02.677 --> 1:43:04.944
Sergeant, I have to find
Lieutenant Blake.

1:43:04.946 --> 1:43:06.881
- Do you know where he is?
- No.

1:43:11.686 --> 1:43:13.018
Make way for the stretchers!

1:43:13.020 --> 1:43:14.720
Minor injuries
to the far field.

1:43:14.722 --> 1:43:16.155
Stretchers to me.

1:43:16.157 --> 1:43:18.757
Walking wounded
to the collection area.

1:43:18.759 --> 1:43:21.160
Move aside to let
the stretcher bearers through.

1:43:25.733 --> 1:43:27.668
- Move it.
- Clear the way.

1:43:28.803 --> 1:43:30.970
Sir, is Lieutenant Blake here?

1:43:30.972 --> 1:43:33.239
No idea.

1:43:33.241 --> 1:43:36.175
Move along, Corporal.

1:43:36.177 --> 1:43:38.978
If you can walk,
move to the triage area.

1:43:38.980 --> 1:43:40.779
I can't move.

1:43:40.781 --> 1:43:41.983
Help me.

1:43:44.752 --> 1:43:46.018
Let me go home.

1:43:46.020 --> 1:43:47.286
Lieutenant Blake!

1:43:47.288 --> 1:43:49.223
I need an M.O. over here.

1:43:52.727 --> 1:43:54.126
Sir, he's out.

1:43:54.128 --> 1:43:56.929
Get him out of here, now.

1:43:56.931 --> 1:43:59.999
Out of the bloody way.

1:44:00.001 --> 1:44:02.134
Blake?!

1:44:02.136 --> 1:44:03.802
Out of the way!

1:44:03.804 --> 1:44:05.873
Has anyone seen
Lieutenant Blake?!

1:44:07.775 --> 1:44:08.908
He's hemorrhaging.
Go quickly.

1:44:08.910 --> 1:44:10.910
He needs a surgeon.

1:44:10.912 --> 1:44:13.946
I want to be left here.

1:44:13.948 --> 1:44:16.315
Tourniquet!

1:44:16.317 --> 1:44:18.217
- Don't look. It's okay.
- Amputation.

1:44:18.219 --> 1:44:20.119
Straight to surgery.

1:44:21.956 --> 1:44:25.159
My leg! My leg.

1:44:28.296 --> 1:44:30.229
I need some help here, quickly!

1:44:30.231 --> 1:44:31.830
He's gone.

1:44:31.832 --> 1:44:34.099
I can't die.

1:44:34.101 --> 1:44:36.101
Don't let me fucking die.

1:44:36.103 --> 1:44:38.239
- I need something now!
- I need my mum.

1:44:40.942 --> 1:44:42.143
Coming through.

1:44:56.090 --> 1:44:58.224
All right, come on, boys.

1:44:58.226 --> 1:45:00.125
He's taken one in the leg.

1:45:00.127 --> 1:45:02.127
- He's lost a lot of blood.
- Sir.

1:45:02.129 --> 1:45:03.563
Lieutenant Blake?

1:45:03.565 --> 1:45:06.198
Yes?

1:45:06.200 --> 1:45:09.268
Do you need medical assistance?

1:45:09.270 --> 1:45:11.070
No, sir.

1:45:11.072 --> 1:45:12.372
I'm from the 8th.

1:45:12.374 --> 1:45:15.007
What the hell
are you doing here?

1:45:15.009 --> 1:45:16.875
I was sent here
to deliver a message.

1:45:16.877 --> 1:45:18.077
The 8th?

1:45:18.079 --> 1:45:20.846
You must know my brother.

1:45:20.848 --> 1:45:22.181
I was sent here with him.

1:45:22.183 --> 1:45:24.151
Tom's here? Where is he?

1:45:30.425 --> 1:45:32.361
It was very quick.

1:45:34.429 --> 1:45:36.130
I'm sorry.

1:45:59.987 --> 1:46:02.121
What's your name?

1:46:02.123 --> 1:46:04.058
Schofield, sir.

1:46:06.927 --> 1:46:08.994
I'm sorry, what?

1:46:08.996 --> 1:46:10.863
It's Schofield, sir.

1:46:10.865 --> 1:46:13.299
William Schofield.

1:46:13.301 --> 1:46:14.869
Will.

1:46:16.937 --> 1:46:18.304
Well, you need some food.

1:46:18.306 --> 1:46:20.241
Get yourself to the mess tent.

1:46:35.022 --> 1:46:39.925
If I may, I'd like
to write to your mother.

1:46:39.927 --> 1:46:41.862
Tell her that Tom wasn't alone.

1:46:44.499 --> 1:46:46.435
Of course.

1:46:49.136 --> 1:46:51.970
He was...

1:46:51.972 --> 1:46:53.841
He was a good man.

1:46:55.677 --> 1:46:57.845
Always telling funny stories.

1:47:00.382 --> 1:47:02.351
He saved my life.

1:47:06.120 --> 1:47:08.089
I am glad you were with him.

1:47:14.128 --> 1:47:16.063
Thank you, Will.
