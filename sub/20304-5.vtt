NARRATOR:
<i>Coming tonight on </i>Hill Street Blues<i>...</i>

00:03.753 --> 00:07.340
I'm afraid being assaulted this early
in the morning kinda makes me cranky.

00:07.424 --> 00:09.759
Is he here? Please tell me he's here.

00:10.051 --> 00:12.387
-Who?
-Frank Jr. He's missing.

00:12.470 --> 00:14.889
Now if you think
you are inconvenienced now,

00:14.973 --> 00:16.558
just think where you would be
if me and my partner

00:16.641 --> 00:17.767
hadn't showed up this morning.

00:17.851 --> 00:19.519
Given all of this, Officer Bates,

00:19.602 --> 00:21.396
how can you expect this court

00:21.479 --> 00:23.815
to have any faith
in anything you've told them today?

00:23.898 --> 00:26.735
There is no more irrational creature
on this planet

00:26.943 --> 00:28.361
than a frightened parent, Frank.

00:28.445 --> 00:30.238
Freeze! Police officers!

00:30.697 --> 00:32.157
(gunshots)

00:34.701 --> 00:36.870
PHIL:<i> Item ten, folks!</i>

00:38.872 --> 00:41.791
If only my professional police officers

00:41.875 --> 00:45.962
were as attentive and as well-mannered
as my cadets.

00:46.880 --> 00:50.091
Item ten, which may be of particular
interest to those among you

00:50.175 --> 00:51.968
who have some knowledge,
passing or otherwise,

00:52.052 --> 00:55.555
of a string of massage parlors
and adult bookstores

00:55.638 --> 00:57.724
on the south end of Hay Street.

00:58.892 --> 01:01.311
Said establishments
have experienced a rash--

01:01.394 --> 01:03.021
(all laughing)

01:04.898 --> 01:08.193
An unusual number of holdups
in the last two weeks.

01:08.485 --> 01:11.738
So, should any of you
be regular patrons of the, uh,

01:12.238 --> 01:15.033
Scandinavian Holistic Massage Institute,

01:15.617 --> 01:17.827
don't be surprised to find
Detective Belker

01:17.911 --> 01:19.913
behind the counter on your next visit.

01:19.996 --> 01:21.372
(all hooting)

01:21.456 --> 01:24.250
LaRue and Washington
will be across the street on this one

01:24.334 --> 01:27.420
and additional units may be required
on short notice.

01:28.254 --> 01:29.422
-Item 11.
-(paper rustling)

01:31.966 --> 01:34.803
-PHIL: Officer Renko, if you don't mind.
-(all laughing)

01:36.888 --> 01:39.641
A memo from Lieutenant Rosemary Zurilli...

01:39.724 --> 01:40.934
(murmuring, whistling)

01:41.017 --> 01:43.853
...who will be conducting
interdepartmental aerobics

01:43.937 --> 01:46.147
starting tomorrow morning
before roll call.

01:47.107 --> 01:49.818
In addition to exercises
and general fitness,

01:49.901 --> 01:52.362
Lieutenant Zurilli will be giving advice

01:52.445 --> 01:54.739
along the lines of diet and nutrition.

01:55.657 --> 01:58.493
I advise you to consider
the relative benefits,

01:58.576 --> 02:00.120
appearance-wise,

02:00.620 --> 02:03.540
mobility-wise and cardiovascular-wise.

02:03.623 --> 02:04.791
It couldn't hurt.

02:05.625 --> 02:06.626
Last item.

02:06.960 --> 02:09.295
There will be a very special brunch
this morning

02:09.379 --> 02:11.548
for our own Ray Calletano,

02:11.923 --> 02:14.843
who has been named
Hispanic Officer of the Year.

02:14.926 --> 02:16.594
(cheering)

02:21.307 --> 02:23.309
So, before we're all catapulted

02:23.393 --> 02:26.020
into another grueling confrontation
with the urban wilds,

02:26.104 --> 02:29.315
let's take a moment
to congratulate Lt. Calletano

02:29.691 --> 02:33.528
for this highly prestigious
and much deserved award.

02:33.611 --> 02:35.363
(applause continues)

02:35.446 --> 02:37.115
All right, that's it. Let's roll.

02:37.198 --> 02:40.326
And, hey, let's be careful out there.

02:47.167 --> 02:50.128
-Come on. Let's go.
-I can't. I can't find my memo book.

02:50.211 --> 02:52.172
I left it right here
before I went to roll call.

02:52.255 --> 02:55.425
Some jerk probably thinks he's being cute.

02:59.387 --> 03:00.597
-Thanks.
-Luce, would you just relax?

03:00.680 --> 03:01.514
I'm relaxed.

03:01.598 --> 03:03.600
You'd think you were getting ready to go
to Jupiter or something.

03:03.683 --> 03:05.602
-It's no big deal!
-I know it's no big deal.

03:06.352 --> 03:10.523
Miss Davenport? About this afternoon,
is there anything we should bring with us?

03:10.899 --> 03:13.026
Just the arrest report and your memo book
if you need it.

03:13.109 --> 03:14.694
Property will supply the rest.

03:15.278 --> 03:16.696
You know,
this is the first time I'm on the stand.

03:16.779 --> 03:18.489
I mean,
I've done a lot of preliminaries before.

03:18.573 --> 03:20.742
It's just that I've never gone to trial
for once.

03:21.117 --> 03:23.411
Don't worry.
It's really not very different.

03:25.663 --> 03:28.958
Chief Daniels, my esteemed colleagues,

03:29.292 --> 03:30.210
-it is with great--
-HOWARD: Ray.

03:30.293 --> 03:34.589
I would like to offer my sincere
congratulations on this Hispanic thing.

03:34.672 --> 03:35.506
Good job.

03:36.341 --> 03:37.258
Thank you, Howard.

03:39.427 --> 03:40.762
Anything wrong,<i> amigo?</i>

03:41.346 --> 03:42.722
To tell you the truth, Howard,

03:42.972 --> 03:45.308
I'm not looking forward
to making this speech today.

03:45.391 --> 03:47.727
Oh, well... (blows)

03:47.977 --> 03:49.854
...when you analyze the situation, Ray,

03:49.938 --> 03:51.648
there is no reason for you to be nervous.

03:51.731 --> 03:54.067
After all, you're the<i> hombre </i>of the hour.

03:54.317 --> 03:56.236
You get up there,
you express your appreciation,

03:56.319 --> 03:57.904
and then you elaborate for a few minutes

03:57.987 --> 04:00.406
on how much the department
has meant to you, and then you sit down.

04:00.490 --> 04:01.616
Now, how tough could that be?

04:01.699 --> 04:03.910
Well, when you put it like that,
it's easy, but...

04:04.160 --> 04:07.330
Besides, given your somewhat
limited command of<i> Ingl√©s,</i>

04:07.413 --> 04:09.374
no one expects you to be Noel Coward.

04:09.999 --> 04:12.252
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

04:12.710 --> 04:14.379
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

04:14.462 --> 04:18.299
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

04:18.383 --> 04:19.968
(sirens wailing)

04:25.431 --> 04:29.352
(theme music playing)

05:38.921 --> 05:42.383
I tell you, you live with somebody,
you work with somebody every day,

05:42.467 --> 05:44.927
and then all of the sudden,
out of the clear blue nowhere,

05:45.011 --> 05:47.180
they start in to criticizing
your physical constitution.

05:47.263 --> 05:50.099
All I said, Renko, was maybe it
wouldn't hurt you to get more exercise.

05:50.183 --> 05:52.977
For your information,
I am in top physical condition,

05:53.061 --> 05:56.522
and I don't need to put on no leotard
and show up at the crack of dawn

05:56.606 --> 05:58.816
to prove it to anybody,
thank you very much.

05:58.900 --> 06:01.235
-Fine. Let's just drop it.
-On whose life, Bobby Hill?

06:01.319 --> 06:03.571
On whose life do I have to swear

06:03.654 --> 06:07.492
that I get up and do 100 push-ups
the minute my feet hit the floor

06:07.575 --> 06:09.035
-every single morning of my life?
-(woman screams)

06:09.118 --> 06:09.952
Look at this.

06:10.036 --> 06:12.997
-(siren blaring)
-This is 2202. Assault in progress.

06:13.081 --> 06:15.708
Moving vehicle. Foot pursuit.
People's Parkway and Central.

06:26.094 --> 06:26.928
(yelling)

06:28.554 --> 06:30.348
-I got him!
-(yelling continues)

06:31.474 --> 06:33.184
Why me, Lord? Why?

06:36.521 --> 06:37.730
(horn honks)

06:40.316 --> 06:41.192
(tires screech)

06:43.653 --> 06:44.487
DRIVER: Sucker!

06:53.287 --> 06:54.122
(groans)

06:57.458 --> 06:58.793
Keep moving and I'll break it.

07:02.004 --> 07:03.798
I know what you're thinking, Bobby Hill,

07:04.048 --> 07:07.301
but I tripped on the stairway
and then the cars were coming--

07:07.385 --> 07:10.680
Uh-huh. I'm gonna get him to the car.
Order a backup.

07:10.763 --> 07:14.183
I can show you the exact spot
in which that occurred.

07:14.267 --> 07:16.644
Renko, I believe you.
Why don't you go pick up the lady.

07:16.727 --> 07:19.063
Give you a chance to show off
your physical constitution.

07:19.147 --> 07:22.817
-And don't forget to pick up the blade.
-Why don't you go pick up the lady?

07:34.036 --> 07:34.996
You all right, ma'am?

07:35.455 --> 07:37.790
(scoffs) I'm terrific, Officer.
How are you?

07:38.040 --> 07:41.252
Uh, you know, it's a good thing
me and my partner showed up when we did.

07:42.587 --> 07:46.299
I guess I should fly into
a my hero routine, right?

07:46.924 --> 07:49.719
Oh, no, ma'am, that won't be necessary.
Just a simple thank you would do.

07:51.929 --> 07:52.763
I'm sorry.

07:53.556 --> 07:57.226
I'm afraid being assaulted this early
in the morning kinda makes me cranky.

08:02.064 --> 08:02.899
Thank you.

08:04.442 --> 08:07.528
You know, ma'am,
if you don't mind my saying so,

08:07.612 --> 08:09.822
this isn't exactly the finest neighborhood

08:09.906 --> 08:14.035
for a woman of your obvious socioeconomic
stature to be strolling around in.

08:15.828 --> 08:18.623
Well, I much would have preferred my car
to break down

08:18.706 --> 08:20.958
in front of the Hotel Marquis, Officer,

08:21.042 --> 08:23.878
but I really didn't have a lot to say
about it. You know what I mean?

08:23.961 --> 08:26.547
BOBBY: Hey, Renko! Whenever you're ready.

08:27.423 --> 08:30.051
Ma'am, I know this isn't
what you had planned for today,

08:30.134 --> 08:32.929
but, uh, me and my partner are gonna have
to have you get in that car

08:33.012 --> 08:35.389
and come down to the station
and make a statement on this.

08:36.432 --> 08:39.727
We'd be glad to have a tow truck
come take your car.

08:43.731 --> 08:44.565
(chuckles)

08:46.192 --> 08:47.401
(sighs) What the hell.

08:48.444 --> 08:50.238
Morning's kinda shot anyway, huh?

08:51.822 --> 08:55.326
-(music playing)
-(timer rings)

08:58.746 --> 09:01.165
MICK: Number four, your time is up.

09:01.707 --> 09:04.585
You want another half hour, it's $17.50.

09:06.420 --> 09:07.255
Jeannie.

09:07.713 --> 09:09.924
Do I look like a Jeannie to you, hairbag?

09:11.008 --> 09:12.802
Uh, just tell her that Max is here.

09:12.885 --> 09:15.012
Ooh! I'm sure she's holding her breath.

09:15.096 --> 09:18.266
Unfortunately, she's booked solid
for the next two hours.

09:19.058 --> 09:21.936
MICK (on radio):
<i>I could give you Vanessa or Bernice.</i>

09:23.062 --> 09:24.397
MAN:<i> I'll wait for Jeannie.</i>

09:24.772 --> 09:25.940
MICK:<i> Suit yourself.</i>

09:27.608 --> 09:29.694
I'm telling you, man,
it's a miscarriage of justice

09:29.777 --> 09:31.988
putting that little bozo
in a massage parlor.

09:32.363 --> 09:33.698
Life can be cruel, baby.

09:33.781 --> 09:37.076
Hey, man, Belker wouldn't know a good
massage if it came up and bit him.

09:37.618 --> 09:40.204
Matter of fact, that is Belker's idea
of a good massage.

09:40.413 --> 09:43.708
-MAN:<i> I gave you $17.50, you give me this?</i>
-WOMAN:<i> Hang it up, Tarzan!</i>

09:43.791 --> 09:45.126
<i>You brought 'em in with you.</i>

09:45.376 --> 09:47.420
Keep it down in there, number four.

09:47.503 --> 09:50.798
-WOMAN: You infested me, you pig!
-WOMAN 2: Hey, would you be quiet!

09:50.881 --> 09:53.092
You got a beef, bring it in here.

09:53.175 --> 09:56.304
You're damn right I got a beef!
Just look at this!

09:57.138 --> 09:58.681
-WOMAN: Will you shut up!
-What?

09:58.764 --> 10:00.891
This! What does that look like to you?

10:02.852 --> 10:05.605
-A speck.
-It's moving!

10:07.898 --> 10:08.983
It's a moving speck.

10:09.483 --> 10:12.069
It's a crab, you moron!

10:12.153 --> 10:15.531
This whole place is infested,
and now so am I!

10:15.615 --> 10:18.075
How am I supposed to explain this
to my wife?

10:18.159 --> 10:20.369
Tell her you went to the beach
on your lunch hour.

10:20.453 --> 10:21.537
(groans)

10:22.705 --> 10:26.208
I'm calling the state board of health!
I'm gonna have this place shut down!

10:26.459 --> 10:28.419
You're gonna be hearing from me!

10:30.046 --> 10:31.672
(buzzer buzzes)

10:33.299 --> 10:34.133
(door closes)

10:40.056 --> 10:41.932
I-- it does appear to be moving.

10:43.768 --> 10:45.394
Not anymore.

10:52.443 --> 10:54.528
Come on, pal, move it. I said move it.

10:56.155 --> 10:57.865
-(wolf whistle)
-Not bad, bro.

10:57.948 --> 10:59.241
You want me to frisk her for ya?

10:59.325 --> 11:02.578
What I would like you to do
is shut your face before I relocate it

11:02.662 --> 11:04.246
in the vicinity of your butt.

11:06.248 --> 11:07.458
Nice place you've got here.

11:07.792 --> 11:09.960
Well, it's a little quiet here today. Leo!

11:10.044 --> 11:12.630
Lee, I got a personal assault case
and an impounded vehicle.

11:12.713 --> 11:14.715
-I need some forms--
-Excuse me.

11:15.466 --> 11:18.135
Um, do you have any idea
how long this is gonna take?

11:18.219 --> 11:19.387
Half hour. All day.

11:19.470 --> 11:21.889
Anyway, I also need to see a policewoman
down here

11:21.972 --> 11:23.265
to deal with this woman's
cuts and bruises.

11:23.349 --> 11:26.644
Excuse me. I have an appointment
with my lawyer for lunch.

11:26.727 --> 11:29.480
So if I could just use the phone,
perhaps I could cancel that.

11:29.897 --> 11:30.731
Thank you.

11:39.490 --> 11:41.826
Is he here? Please tell me he's here.

11:42.493 --> 11:45.162
-Who?
-Frank Jr. He's missing.

11:45.246 --> 11:48.582
-What do you mean, missing?
-We had a fight at breakfast.

11:48.666 --> 11:52.211
He wanted to go camping with the Benjamins
and I told him he couldn't.

11:52.461 --> 11:55.548
He stormed out of the house
in the kind of Mediterranean rage

11:55.631 --> 11:57.216
he could have only inherited from--

11:57.800 --> 11:59.969
Well, he forgot his lunch box.
And when I went by the school,

12:00.052 --> 12:01.637
they told me he never showed up.

12:02.179 --> 12:06.559
Frank, I called everyone, I--
I walked every inch of the neighborhood.

12:06.892 --> 12:10.020
Fay, kids have been playing hooky
from school since the dawn of time.

12:10.354 --> 12:12.648
In a couple of hours, he'll get hungry
and hightail it home for lunch.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.692
But what if something happens to him?

12:15.359 --> 12:16.527
What could happen to him?

12:16.986 --> 12:19.029
(sighs) Well, I don't know!

12:19.238 --> 12:22.616
I mean, this isn't some
little street-smart urchin that--

12:23.951 --> 12:27.788
This happens to be a very sensitive
little eight-year-old child

12:28.456 --> 12:30.875
who happens to be far too trusting
for his own good.

12:31.250 --> 12:33.627
Lt. Ganeles, please. Captain Furillo.

12:34.879 --> 12:36.547
-What was he wearing?
-Um...

12:37.298 --> 12:40.509
he had on blue jeans
and a-- and a white T-shirt,

12:40.593 --> 12:42.636
one of those, uh, gray sweatshirt jackets,

12:42.720 --> 12:44.638
you know,
the kind with the zipper in the front,

12:44.722 --> 12:47.850
tennis shoes and a ca-- A baseball hat.

12:47.933 --> 12:51.353
Hi, Ted. Frank Furillo. Just fine.

12:51.729 --> 12:53.230
Yeah. And you?

12:54.815 --> 12:57.234
Listen, Ted, I have a small problem here.

12:57.318 --> 13:00.070
My son, Frank Jr., he's eight.

13:01.363 --> 13:03.824
Uh, he took a powder
from the house this morning

13:03.908 --> 13:06.744
-and his mom is-- is a little concerned.
-A little?

13:07.036 --> 13:08.829
TED:<i> Give me a description.</i>
<i>I'll see if I can find him.</i>

13:08.913 --> 13:11.415
Oh, great. Yeah. Uh-huh.

13:12.208 --> 13:15.544
Four feet one or two,
brown hair, brown eyes,

13:15.878 --> 13:18.130
blue jeans, white T-shirt,

13:18.422 --> 13:19.256
sneakers,

13:19.882 --> 13:24.011
uh, one of those sweatshirt jackets,
gray, zip up the front.

13:25.262 --> 13:27.306
And a baseball cap. Dark blue.

13:29.183 --> 13:31.685
Oh, I expect him to come waltzing in
in a couple of hours

13:31.769 --> 13:33.270
under his own steam, you know.

13:34.688 --> 13:35.856
<i>-Hey, you want me to--</i>
-Oh, yeah.

13:35.940 --> 13:37.858
If you could put the word out,
that'd be great.

13:37.942 --> 13:39.485
<i>-Maybe a phone number.</i>
-Sure.

13:39.568 --> 13:43.656
<i>-What's the number?</i>
-555-823--

13:43.989 --> 13:45.574
-3-1.
-FRANK: 3-1.

13:47.201 --> 13:49.203
HENRY: Fay? Frank Jr.?

13:50.079 --> 13:52.414
Henry, he ran away from home this morning.

13:53.749 --> 13:56.335
Believe me, it is nothing to worry about.

13:56.627 --> 13:59.129
I've done it myself a few times. Recently.

13:59.755 --> 14:02.550
FRANK: Yeah. I appreciate it, Ted.

14:02.925 --> 14:04.718
Say hello to your wife for me, will you.

14:05.386 --> 14:06.345
I'll be here.

14:07.429 --> 14:08.264
Thanks.

14:09.557 --> 14:11.559
He's putting out the word
to all his uniforms.

14:11.642 --> 14:13.936
In the meantime, I want you
to go home and just wait.

14:14.019 --> 14:15.771
Frank, if anything happens to him--

14:15.855 --> 14:18.065
Nothing's happened to him,
and nothing's going to happen.

14:18.399 --> 14:20.776
Go home, and I'll call you a little later.

14:21.777 --> 14:23.654
-Okay.
-Don't worry, Fay.

14:23.988 --> 14:26.323
Running away from home
is as American as apple pie.

14:26.532 --> 14:27.408
(sighs)

14:28.325 --> 14:29.243
I hope you're right.

14:33.455 --> 14:34.623
Uh, just to be on the safe side,

14:34.707 --> 14:37.293
why don't I have Dispatch
put out his description?

14:38.210 --> 14:39.044
Good idea.

14:41.672 --> 14:43.132
-Harry.
-Good to see you again.

14:43.215 --> 14:45.467
-Drink up, gentlemen. Enjoy yourselves.
-Thank you.

14:48.971 --> 14:49.972
-Chief.
-How are you?

14:50.890 --> 14:53.183
-What is this?
-Huevos rancheros.

14:54.268 --> 14:55.811
Don't you have anything else?

14:56.270 --> 14:57.605
Sorry. That's the menu.

15:00.399 --> 15:02.401
I could get you some more refried beans.

15:04.111 --> 15:07.364
-Hi. How are you?
-WOMAN: Oh, hi.

15:07.448 --> 15:10.451
Well, here's to you, Ray. Congratulations.

15:11.410 --> 15:12.244
<i>Ol√©.</i>

15:13.370 --> 15:15.623
I never drink more than one margarita.

15:16.165 --> 15:20.085
Oh, come on, Ray. You're not gonna be
a killjoy at your own fiesta.

15:22.630 --> 15:24.590
I guess one more wouldn't hurt.

15:28.260 --> 15:30.763
DANIELS: If-- if I could have
your attention, please.

15:32.973 --> 15:37.019
Several years ago, I was instrumental
in establishing a program

15:37.853 --> 15:40.147
to promote Hispanic officers

15:40.230 --> 15:43.525
to positions of prominence and visibility
within the department.

15:44.818 --> 15:45.986
This occasion

15:46.403 --> 15:49.531
marks the great strides that we've made
in that area

15:50.783 --> 15:52.451
since the inception of the program,

15:52.534 --> 15:56.372
and I think that we can all
take great pride in our progress.

15:56.455 --> 15:58.707
At this time, Frank Furillo...

15:59.375 --> 16:02.336
has a few words to say
about our officer of the year.

16:02.419 --> 16:04.880
Uh, Chief. Frank, if you don't mind,

16:04.964 --> 16:07.591
I think sentiment-wise,
I can speak for all of us on the Hill.

16:07.675 --> 16:08.926
I don't mind at all, Howard.

16:13.138 --> 16:13.973
Anything?

16:17.267 --> 16:18.185
Thank you, Chief.

16:18.560 --> 16:20.896
If I might digress for a moment,

16:21.522 --> 16:25.234
I remember back to a day in Dartmouth.

16:25.943 --> 16:28.654
I was arguing the con side of a debate

16:28.737 --> 16:31.323
concerning statehood for Puerto Rico.

16:32.282 --> 16:34.118
The lines were drawn,
the battle was clean,

16:34.201 --> 16:36.578
and I, uh, I won the thing.

16:37.705 --> 16:41.375
But having had the good fortune
to work with Ray Calletano,

16:42.835 --> 16:45.004
I can say now with a clear conscience

16:45.546 --> 16:47.923
that I am damn glad
we took that island over.

16:48.757 --> 16:51.010
Ray Calletano is a credit to his people.

16:51.802 --> 16:55.514
He is one of the finest
Puerto Rican-Americans in the department.

16:55.889 --> 16:57.683
And without further fanfare,

16:58.392 --> 17:00.561
I give you Ray Calletano,

17:00.644 --> 17:05.399
a man that I am proud to call<i> amigo</i>.

17:23.792 --> 17:24.877
(feedback squeals)

17:27.421 --> 17:28.589
Chief Daniels,

17:29.548 --> 17:31.175
my esteemed colleagues,

17:32.634 --> 17:36.263
it is with great pride that I accept
and thank you for this award.

17:37.931 --> 17:40.309
At a time like this, I feel...

17:40.809 --> 17:43.353
that there is only one thing
that I can say.

17:44.938 --> 17:48.650
Why huevos rancheros? And why margaritas?

17:49.651 --> 17:53.405
Why do you assume that all Hispanic people
like that kind of food?

17:53.822 --> 17:56.116
I don't like that kind of food.

17:56.742 --> 17:59.870
I'm not Mexican.
I'm not even Puerto Rican.

18:01.038 --> 18:04.541
You go to all this trouble
to give this banquet in my honor,

18:04.875 --> 18:08.462
and no one even bothers to find out
that I'm Colombian,

18:08.879 --> 18:11.215
not Mexican or Puerto Rican.

18:12.508 --> 18:16.178
And furthermore, phrases like
"credit to his people"

18:16.678 --> 18:18.847
and "fine Puerto Rican-American"

18:19.306 --> 18:21.517
tend to stick in the throat of a man

18:21.600 --> 18:24.686
who has been a citizen of this country
for 22 years.

18:25.604 --> 18:28.732
And why is it that when you're down here
today to honor me

18:28.816 --> 18:30.943
as Hispanic Officer of the Year,

18:31.527 --> 18:34.696
I look around a room
full of ranking officers

18:34.780 --> 18:39.368
and the only other Hispanics I see
are waiters and busboys?

18:40.452 --> 18:43.956
As far as I'm concerned,
you can keep your award.

18:51.088 --> 18:53.298
-(murmuring)
-(clapping)

18:54.800 --> 18:56.760
-Oh, no!
-I'm telling you!

18:56.844 --> 18:59.680
He was screaming in Spanish,
he was throwing guacamole!

18:59.763 --> 19:01.723
I heard
it was all because he hates margaritas.

19:01.807 --> 19:04.143
-Pi√±a coladas.
-Margaritas, Coffey.

19:04.226 --> 19:06.228
Pi√±a coladas is a Caribbean drink.

19:06.311 --> 19:08.188
-Where do you think he comes from, Leo?
-Cuba.

19:08.522 --> 19:12.025
-Cuba is the Caribbean.
-Forget about it. He's Costa Rican.

19:15.279 --> 19:16.446
What's everyone looking at?

19:26.039 --> 19:30.544
Look, Lieutenant, I know
this is none of my business, but...

19:31.253 --> 19:34.882
maybe you'd like to talk about it over
a nice, hot cup of margarita-- Coffee.

19:35.966 --> 19:39.011
(speaking Spanish)

19:40.304 --> 19:42.055
Teresa, you're a business woman.

19:42.139 --> 19:44.349
Can you afford to close your shop
long enough

19:44.433 --> 19:46.810
to make eight or nine court appearances?

19:47.227 --> 19:48.896
You gotta consider the bottom line.

19:48.979 --> 19:51.607
You'd be better off legally
if the guy had raped you.

19:52.733 --> 19:54.651
As it is, the cops saved the day

19:54.735 --> 19:58.197
just in time to get the charge
knocked down to aggravated assault.

19:58.280 --> 20:00.199
That won't put anybody away
for six months.

20:01.241 --> 20:02.284
Officer Renko?

20:03.952 --> 20:05.287
What do you think I should do?

20:06.538 --> 20:08.665
Well, I don't do a whole lot of thinking,
ma'am.

20:08.749 --> 20:10.959
I'm too busy showing up
at the scene of a crime, uh,

20:11.043 --> 20:13.420
just in time to mess up
the judicial process.

20:21.470 --> 20:23.889
I tell you, you take
all them gray-suited lawyers,

20:23.972 --> 20:26.350
you round 'em all up,
put 'em on a boat to Indochina,

20:26.433 --> 20:27.601
you wouldn't have no more problems

20:27.684 --> 20:29.478
with the criminal justice system
in this country.

20:29.561 --> 20:32.397
What are you getting so worked up for,
Renko? That won't solve anything.

20:32.481 --> 20:34.524
"Officer Renko,
I don't wanna close up my boutique."

20:34.608 --> 20:36.401
"I don't wanna mess up
my pretty blond hair."

20:36.485 --> 20:39.529
"I don't wanna get involved with some
stinkin' crime out on the street."

20:39.613 --> 20:40.447
Just a minute.

20:42.032 --> 20:45.035
Excuse me. You wanna know what I think?

20:46.411 --> 20:48.956
Miss Hyler, if you are truly interested

20:49.039 --> 20:51.750
in my personal opinion on this matter,
I'd be glad to give it to you.

20:52.292 --> 20:54.753
Now, if you think
you are inconvenienced now,

20:54.836 --> 20:56.296
just think where the hell you would be

20:56.380 --> 20:58.632
if me and my partner
hadn't showed up this morning?

20:58.966 --> 21:02.052
Now, we went in after that guy
at considerable personal risk.

21:02.135 --> 21:03.887
I could have been shot,
I could have been stabbed.

21:03.971 --> 21:05.764
I could have been
just plain stomped to death.

21:07.224 --> 21:10.435
Now, I don't mind doing that.
That's my job.

21:10.936 --> 21:12.396
But it just kicks the wind out of me

21:12.479 --> 21:15.023
to think that I went through all that
and I'm risking my life

21:15.107 --> 21:17.150
so some damn turkey
can go out there next week,

21:17.234 --> 21:19.361
get behind a bush
and jump out on somebody else.

21:20.821 --> 21:22.823
Sort of makes me wonder
why I bother to get up in the morning,

21:22.906 --> 21:23.740
if you catch my meaning.

21:24.074 --> 21:26.743
Well, that's all very inspiring,
Officer Renko,

21:26.827 --> 21:30.289
but not particularly pertinent
to my client's situation.

21:30.747 --> 21:31.623
Come on, Teresa.

21:34.167 --> 21:36.461
"That's all very inspiring, Officer Renko,

21:36.545 --> 21:38.714
but not very pertinent
to my personal situation."

21:41.216 --> 21:44.636
Regular epidemic around here today,
Captain, temper-wise.

21:44.720 --> 21:46.555
-You heard about Ray.
-Yeah.

21:47.431 --> 21:49.725
-Where is he?
-In the locker room.

21:49.808 --> 21:51.893
You'd better check your desk first,
Captain.

21:53.228 --> 21:55.480
-Is there any word about Frank Jr.?
-No.

22:02.988 --> 22:06.450
I've been doing some reading, Ray.
I thought you might want to talk about it.

22:06.533 --> 22:08.368
There is nothing to talk about, Frank.

22:09.411 --> 22:10.829
My career is over.

22:13.457 --> 22:16.168
I made a fool of myself
in front of my friends,

22:16.418 --> 22:18.086
in front of Chief Daniels.

22:19.629 --> 22:21.256
<i>Madre m√≠a.</i>

22:25.677 --> 22:27.429
Personally, I think your reaction
was understandable.

22:27.512 --> 22:30.015
I don't think
anybody meant to be malicious,

22:30.265 --> 22:32.726
but there wasn't an abundance
of sensitivity involved.

22:33.352 --> 22:35.645
I don't know what came over me, Frank.

22:36.313 --> 22:39.441
Something inside just boiled over.

22:40.609 --> 22:41.443
Mmm.

22:42.152 --> 22:43.987
I was at one of these functions
about seven years ago,

22:44.071 --> 22:45.447
back when I was still drinking,

22:46.990 --> 22:48.450
sitting next to Commander Swanson,

22:48.533 --> 22:50.911
and all night long he kept telling
these bad ethnic jokes,

22:50.994 --> 22:52.245
just one after the other.

22:53.413 --> 22:54.998
I'd had a little too much to drink.

22:56.375 --> 22:59.002
-I'd had a lot too much to drink--
-I wasn't drunk, Frank.

22:59.586 --> 23:02.130
I'll admit, those two margaritas
loosened my tongue,

23:02.214 --> 23:04.257
but I wasn't drunk.

23:05.384 --> 23:06.968
And I meant every word I said.

23:07.260 --> 23:08.512
I-- I know you did, Ray.

23:09.805 --> 23:12.682
(clears throat)
Well, by the time Swanson got to...

23:13.850 --> 23:16.103
about his fifth<i> paisan </i>routine,

23:16.436 --> 23:18.522
I finally took exception,
I was so annoyed.

23:18.605 --> 23:19.439
How?

23:20.315 --> 23:23.819
Rumor has it I poured a double scotch
on the rocks down the front of his shirt.

23:24.069 --> 23:25.862
No. Really?

23:27.197 --> 23:29.032
Then I stormed out of there,

23:29.116 --> 23:30.992
came back here, wrote one of these and...

23:32.494 --> 23:34.246
fortunately, no one would accept it.

23:37.541 --> 23:39.167
You're damn good at your job, Ray,

23:39.251 --> 23:40.877
but you're no less human
than the rest of us,

23:40.961 --> 23:42.254
and nobody expects you to be.

23:44.673 --> 23:47.676
If it'll make you feel any better,
I think you made some valid points.

23:50.679 --> 23:51.555
Thanks, Frank.

23:58.437 --> 24:01.565
<i>"Yo Ram√≥n Calletano</i>
<i>ofrezco mi resignaci√≥n"?</i>

24:02.149 --> 24:07.195
Ray, aren't you carrying this Latino thing
a little bit too far?

24:07.863 --> 24:11.741
Judas H., man,
if you're gonna throw in the towel,

24:11.825 --> 24:15.370
sit on a sword, not a goldarned tamale.

24:32.387 --> 24:33.763
I got four guys in the alley,
you got five.

24:33.847 --> 24:35.557
What's that, Einstein, 4.5 guys?

24:35.640 --> 24:38.143
Luce, I promise,
you're making too much out of this.

24:38.685 --> 24:40.729
I wouldn't be surprised
if we didn't even get up there.

24:40.812 --> 24:44.149
Cases like this, most of the time,
they make a deal at the last minute.

24:44.649 --> 24:46.568
So I might be going through all this
for nothing?

24:46.651 --> 24:48.487
That's what I've been trying to tell you.

24:49.654 --> 24:52.407
-So why do I worry until I have to worry?
-Exactly.

24:53.283 --> 24:55.702
Would you please recount
exactly what took place

24:55.785 --> 24:58.914
after you witnessed
my client's alleged drug purchase?

24:59.247 --> 25:02.083
Joe-- Officer Coffey and I

25:02.167 --> 25:03.376
had just pulled up

25:03.793 --> 25:07.088
and, uh, the guy took off down the alley.

25:07.464 --> 25:09.633
-The guy being?
-Your client.

25:09.716 --> 25:12.344
Uh, Clarence Jenkins.

25:12.802 --> 25:13.803
Please continue.

25:14.304 --> 25:17.182
Well, the other guys-- The buyers, uh,

25:17.265 --> 25:18.934
took off in all different directions.

25:19.142 --> 25:22.771
And, uh, we went after Jenkins
down the alley.

25:22.854 --> 25:27.943
And, uh, he-- he dropped this envelope
in a trash can and then kept going.

25:28.026 --> 25:30.028
So we finally caught him and then
we got the envelope

25:30.111 --> 25:31.947
-out of the trash can.
-Officer Bates, how many people

25:32.030 --> 25:34.491
were in the alley
when you and Officer Coffey arrived?

25:35.116 --> 25:38.245
I think there were four or five.
Four or five.

25:39.287 --> 25:41.414
Then you don't recall the exact number?

25:42.499 --> 25:44.376
Well, it was three months ago.

25:45.585 --> 25:49.047
Officer Bates, I'm aware
that the details of the situation

25:49.130 --> 25:52.133
may have slipped your mind
in the time that has lapsed.

25:52.842 --> 25:54.844
In fact, given the ephemeral state
of your memory,

25:54.928 --> 25:58.348
how can you be certain my client
is the person who dropped the envelope

25:58.431 --> 25:59.599
into the trash can?

25:59.933 --> 26:01.643
Because I saw him do it.

26:01.726 --> 26:04.104
Then your memory
is only selectively flimsy.

26:04.187 --> 26:06.940
I'm just telling you
what I remember I saw.

26:07.023 --> 26:08.817
Prior to the convening of this trial,

26:08.900 --> 26:11.653
did you rehearse this testimony
with Officer Coffey?

26:11.945 --> 26:14.573
-No.
-What if I were to tell you

26:14.656 --> 26:18.451
that just ten minutes ago
on this witness stand,

26:19.077 --> 26:20.370
while you were being sequestered,

26:20.453 --> 26:21.997
Officer Coffey testified

26:22.080 --> 26:25.625
that you did in fact
discuss this case extensively

26:25.709 --> 26:27.419
on your way to the courtroom today?

26:27.794 --> 26:29.087
Would that change your answer?

26:29.588 --> 26:31.131
We talked about it--

26:31.214 --> 26:34.217
Then you now admit that you did discuss
the case with Officer Coffey.

26:34.551 --> 26:36.219
We did discuss it, but--

26:36.303 --> 26:37.387
Officer Bates,

26:38.430 --> 26:43.977
if two suspects were confined together,
alone, in an interrogation room

26:44.060 --> 26:47.897
so that they had ample chance
to compare their stories

26:47.981 --> 26:50.233
and agree on what they would say
before questioning,

26:50.317 --> 26:52.777
would you be likely to believe anything
they told you?

26:54.154 --> 26:55.572
I guess not. I mean--

26:55.655 --> 26:57.240
So, Officer Bates,

26:57.699 --> 27:01.411
given the fact that this is exactly
what you and Officer Coffey did

27:01.661 --> 27:03.705
immediately prior to this trial,

27:04.205 --> 27:08.293
and given your sporadic lapses of memory
concerning the details in this case,

27:08.376 --> 27:09.919
and especially given the fact

27:10.211 --> 27:14.132
that, when questioned a few minutes ago,
you did not divulge the entire truth

27:14.215 --> 27:17.135
as to the nature of your conversation
with Officer Coffey.

27:17.218 --> 27:19.137
Given all of this, Officer Bates,

27:19.763 --> 27:21.598
How can you expect this court

27:22.098 --> 27:24.434
to have any faith
in anything you've told them today?

27:36.446 --> 27:38.365
I have no further questions, Your Honor.

27:44.204 --> 27:46.039
MICK (on radio):<i> Six, your time is up.</i>

27:47.040 --> 27:48.124
<i>Can I help you?</i>

27:48.208 --> 27:50.794
MAN:<i> Uh, yeah. I'd like to see Jeannie.</i>

27:51.336 --> 27:55.215
She's booked.
I can give you Vanessa in ten minutes.

27:55.632 --> 27:59.344
Well, uh, when's Jeannie gonna be free?

28:02.806 --> 28:04.099
Not in your lifetime.

28:05.100 --> 28:05.934
(scoffs)

28:06.935 --> 28:09.979
Well, she must be, uh, kinda popular
around here, huh?

28:10.063 --> 28:12.482
Yep. I don't know what it is with her.

28:12.565 --> 28:14.484
She must really be something special.

28:14.984 --> 28:18.238
Yeah, she's something special, all right.
She's my wife!

28:18.613 --> 28:20.949
Hey! You can't go back there!

28:23.410 --> 28:25.203
There you are, you little tramp.

28:25.286 --> 28:27.122
Get your clothes on! I'm taking you
out of here right now!

28:27.205 --> 28:28.998
Who the hell said you could come in here?

28:29.082 --> 28:30.750
You mess around with my wife, fat boy?

28:30.834 --> 28:32.794
Huh? Is that what you're doing?
You mess around with my wife?

28:32.877 --> 28:35.296
-This guy says he's your husband.
-Oh, he's not my anything.

28:35.380 --> 28:38.049
I kicked the creep out three months ago
and he won't leave me alone.

28:38.133 --> 28:41.344
Look, I told you if you came back
around here I was gonna call the cops.

28:41.428 --> 28:42.262
I'm not leaving without you, Jeannie.

28:42.345 --> 28:44.931
JEANNIE:<i> Well, I'm not going anywhere</i>
<i>with you, you wormy piece of mold.</i>

28:45.014 --> 28:45.849
Boring.

28:46.099 --> 28:47.684
Buddy, I don't know what your problem is,

28:47.767 --> 28:51.479
but this area is off-limits
unless you pay your $17.50.

28:51.563 --> 28:54.399
You heard him!
Get out of my life, you creep!

28:54.983 --> 28:57.402
Did you ask for her special, did you,
huh, fat man?

28:57.485 --> 28:58.987
Did you get everything you want?

28:59.070 --> 29:01.656
I am a legitimate, licensed masseuse,
you slime!

29:01.740 --> 29:05.076
Sure you are! I bet you got a wife
back home somewhere, too!

29:05.160 --> 29:07.412
She know you're getting your oil changed
every afternoon?

29:07.495 --> 29:10.498
<i>-</i>(Jeannie screams)
-MICK:<i> Get outta my way!</i>

29:11.207 --> 29:13.168
Mister. Mister, are you all--

29:13.835 --> 29:15.962
Heart attack.
We got a heart attack in here.

29:17.589 --> 29:18.882
Dispatch, Angel One.

29:19.257 --> 29:23.344
Give us an ambulance at 2524 North Park.
That's 2524 North Park.

29:27.307 --> 29:28.808
Come on. Come on!

29:32.020 --> 29:34.105
DISPATCH (on radio):
<i>Roger, Angel One. 2524 North...</i>

29:38.276 --> 29:40.779
-(coughing)
-(exhales)

29:42.113 --> 29:43.114
He's breathing.

29:43.740 --> 29:45.074
JEANNIE:<i> You stinkin' creep.</i>

29:45.283 --> 29:47.660
<i>You almost killed my best customer.</i>

29:47.744 --> 29:48.745
(chuckling)

29:50.079 --> 29:50.914
Lieutenant.

29:51.998 --> 29:53.875
What you said this morning at the banquet,

29:54.125 --> 29:56.044
all the brothers
have been talking about it.

29:56.544 --> 29:57.629
We're proud of you, man.

29:58.338 --> 30:00.256
You said something that we all wanted to.

30:02.926 --> 30:05.845
-<i>Muy bravo</i>, bro.
-<i>Gracias</i>.

30:07.347 --> 30:10.391
Ray, I don't think
you have anything to worry about

30:10.475 --> 30:12.894
concerning your little fusillade
this morning.

30:12.977 --> 30:16.272
-No?
-Why, you're a 20-year man,<i> hombre</i>.

30:16.773 --> 30:19.442
With your pension
and a little security work on the side,

30:19.526 --> 30:22.237
you'll be in serious<i> centavos</i>
until you're 85.

30:23.446 --> 30:26.908
I have had serious reservations
about remaining a cop today.

30:26.991 --> 30:29.786
-Well, what else is new?
-I risk my life catching criminals

30:29.869 --> 30:33.081
only to have
some college-educated attorney

30:33.164 --> 30:34.541
throw the case out of court.

30:34.624 --> 30:36.709
-It don't make sense to me.
-Officer Renko?

30:39.921 --> 30:41.631
What, did you, uh, forget something?

30:43.216 --> 30:44.050
Yes.

30:44.551 --> 30:46.344
I forgot my responsibilities.

30:47.679 --> 30:49.597
I'll-- I'll catch up with you later.

30:50.223 --> 30:51.641
Responsibility to what?

30:52.600 --> 30:54.644
To you, to other women,

30:55.728 --> 30:56.646
to myself.

30:57.146 --> 31:00.817
Uh, I would like to press charges
against that man if it isn't too late.

31:01.901 --> 31:02.902
No, it's not too late.

31:03.194 --> 31:04.279
Of course, there's a whole lot of forms

31:04.362 --> 31:05.864
you're gonna have to fill out
if you don't mind.

31:05.947 --> 31:08.867
-I don't mind.
-Then I don't mind helping you.

31:09.742 --> 31:11.369
-Thank you.
-LUCY: Tell me why you did it!

31:11.452 --> 31:13.204
-In here?
-JOE: Will you just forget it, Luce?

31:13.621 --> 31:15.957
Whose business is it anyway
if we talked about the case?

31:16.040 --> 31:17.625
-Just forget it.
-This is bogus, man!

31:17.709 --> 31:20.753
-Sit down and shut up!
-You can't bring me here against my will!

31:20.837 --> 31:24.048
I want justice! I ain't sitting down
and shutting up till I get some!

31:24.132 --> 31:27.635
Why did you have to tell her?
What for, huh?

31:27.719 --> 31:29.387
What for? She asked me.

31:29.721 --> 31:31.598
Where do you get off dumping this on me?

31:31.806 --> 31:34.517
-If this guy walks, it's because of you.
-What's the trouble here?

31:34.601 --> 31:37.228
Luce is all bent out of shape because
she blew her first court appearance.

31:37.312 --> 31:39.981
-Now she's blaming old motormouth here.
-You the man in charge?

31:40.064 --> 31:43.484
-I'm suing the police department.
-This guy refused to sign a citation.

31:43.568 --> 31:45.194
I got something you can "citate"!

31:45.278 --> 31:48.156
When I tried to bring him in,
he resisted arrest.

31:48.239 --> 31:50.575
-And a lot of help you were.
-What was the violation?

31:50.658 --> 31:51.910
I didn't violate nothing!

31:52.285 --> 31:54.245
Go ahead, tell him, Luce.
He's your collar.

31:55.371 --> 31:57.081
Driving with a mutilated license.

31:57.165 --> 31:59.417
-A mutilated license?
-That's a lie!

31:59.500 --> 32:01.419
That's a damn lie! Show him!

32:03.922 --> 32:07.091
You see? That license don't mutilate
for two more years!

32:10.595 --> 32:12.639
Wait a minute. Don't start in
with that absent father routine.

32:12.722 --> 32:14.891
I do the best I can
under the circumstances.

32:18.561 --> 32:19.395
Okay.

32:20.396 --> 32:23.441
You're right. We're not helping each other
talking like this. I'm sorry.

32:24.275 --> 32:25.109
We'll find him.

32:25.902 --> 32:27.195
Everything will be all right.

32:28.237 --> 32:29.447
Yes, I'm sure.

32:30.949 --> 32:32.825
I do, too. Yeah.

32:43.962 --> 32:45.421
Left this at the coffee machine.

32:49.717 --> 32:50.551
(clears throat)

32:53.554 --> 32:56.474
We handle 100 lost children a year, Frank.

32:56.557 --> 32:58.726
Ninety eight of them
turn out with happy endings.

32:58.810 --> 33:01.104
He knows how to use a phone.
Why hasn't he called?

33:01.646 --> 33:04.107
Is he tall enough
to reach a slot on a pay phone?

33:06.067 --> 33:07.068
(sighs)

33:08.361 --> 33:11.030
There is no more irrational creature
on this planet

33:11.280 --> 33:12.740
than a frightened parent, Frank.

33:13.741 --> 33:17.704
Can't think straight. Can't do anything
but worry yourself sick.

33:18.204 --> 33:20.081
I'm speaking from experience.

33:20.540 --> 33:23.459
I never knew what gut fear was
till Josh was in the hospital.

33:24.919 --> 33:26.045
You were there with me, Frank.

33:27.046 --> 33:29.132
Henry, I've been a cop for 18 years.

33:29.841 --> 33:34.178
Eighteen years of murders and rapes
and senseless brutality.

33:36.723 --> 33:39.392
After a while, we learn
how to distance ourselves.

33:39.475 --> 33:41.519
You know, build walls...

33:43.062 --> 33:46.232
so it can't touch us
and so we can sleep at night.

33:47.900 --> 33:48.735
But this--

33:54.949 --> 33:56.159
He's all right, Frank.

33:56.993 --> 33:58.077
I know he is.

34:02.999 --> 34:04.667
-(music playing)
-(exhales)

34:08.880 --> 34:10.048
Am I beat.

34:11.174 --> 34:13.009
Any chance I got a slow day tomorrow?

34:14.260 --> 34:16.471
(chuckling)
You don't have a slow day till June.

34:16.554 --> 34:17.388
(sighs)

34:18.056 --> 34:20.767
Sometimes I wish I wasn't so good
at what I do, you know.

34:23.019 --> 34:26.606
Listen, I gotta tell you
how terrific you were today.

34:26.939 --> 34:29.400
I mean, you saved that guy's life.

34:29.776 --> 34:31.402
You were sensational.

34:31.903 --> 34:33.613
Well, thank you very much.

34:34.197 --> 34:37.742
You know, I got this friend, Rosanne.

34:39.285 --> 34:40.953
She'd go nuts for you.

34:41.579 --> 34:43.998
Now she's got a tootsie for him.
You believe this dame?

34:44.874 --> 34:47.502
MICK:<i> What line of work is she in?</i>

34:47.585 --> 34:49.087
She's a dentist, Belker.

34:49.170 --> 34:51.255
-She's got a good job.
-Yeah?

34:51.589 --> 34:54.133
She's an exotic dancer
over at the Crazy Horse.

34:54.467 --> 34:56.636
<i>They really make the dough,</i>
<i>let me tell ya.</i>

34:57.220 --> 34:58.513
This is priceless.

34:59.388 --> 35:00.723
JEANNIE:<i> Let me give you her number.</i>

35:01.182 --> 35:02.391
Quick, Neal, give me a pen.

35:06.020 --> 35:08.481
JEANNIE:<i> She's home Sundays and mornings.</i>

35:10.691 --> 35:12.985
Or you can leave word with her landlord.

35:14.737 --> 35:15.571
(chuckles)

35:17.073 --> 35:19.242
Well, gotta run.

35:20.201 --> 35:22.787
-See you tomorrow?
-Yeah, sure.

35:28.042 --> 35:30.044
Really. Call her, okay?

35:31.170 --> 35:33.131
You two would be perfect for each other.

35:37.969 --> 35:39.178
(buzzer buzzes)

35:40.346 --> 35:41.180
(sighs)

35:42.515 --> 35:44.142
I'm telling you, Neal, it's criminal.

35:44.225 --> 35:46.060
Locked in all day
with merchandise like that,

35:46.144 --> 35:48.146
and an exotic dancer in the bullpen,

35:48.229 --> 35:49.856
and he's gonna go home
and eat a TV dinner.

35:53.442 --> 35:55.194
(alarm bell ringing)

35:55.278 --> 35:56.195
Hey!

35:58.281 --> 35:59.824
Freeze! Police officers!

36:00.283 --> 36:01.492
(gunshots)

36:04.370 --> 36:05.538
Police! Freeze!

36:12.879 --> 36:14.380
(woman wailing)

36:14.463 --> 36:16.174
(sobbing)

36:17.633 --> 36:19.468
-Move back! Move back!
-(sobbing continues)

36:21.053 --> 36:23.514
JEANNIE: You killed the wrong guy!

36:24.182 --> 36:25.474
You stupid cop!

36:25.558 --> 36:28.019
That's not a crook! That's Enrico!

36:28.102 --> 36:30.646
-He owns the place!
-No, no, no!

36:30.730 --> 36:33.816
I can't bel-- You killed the wrong guy!

36:34.775 --> 36:36.360
(sobbing continues)

36:57.340 --> 36:59.008
You had to buy the gun, huh?

36:59.091 --> 37:00.676
You big stupid!

37:01.427 --> 37:03.596
You want to be a big hero!

37:05.723 --> 37:07.892
You couldn't wait
for the police to come, huh?

37:08.434 --> 37:10.853
You had to show everybody
how brave you are!

37:14.774 --> 37:17.151
Look at how brave you are!

37:17.860 --> 37:20.154
I'm telling you, man,
there's no way you could have known.

37:20.238 --> 37:22.323
If you hadn't fired at him first,
I would have.

37:26.410 --> 37:29.872
Detective, I'm Connally
from Officer-Involved Shootings.

37:29.956 --> 37:33.125
This is Lieutenant Stevens.
We'd like to talk to you now.

37:33.209 --> 37:34.502
(woman sobbing)

37:37.046 --> 37:39.298
Look how brave you are!

37:40.549 --> 37:44.303
Where are you taking him?
No, no, no, no, no!

37:45.263 --> 37:47.848
Please leave him here with me!

37:48.391 --> 37:51.852
Leave him here! I'll take care of him!

37:52.228 --> 37:54.146
Enrico! Enrico!

37:54.230 --> 37:55.606
It's okay. It's okay.

37:56.857 --> 37:59.902
<i>Ay, Dios m√≠o!</i>

38:03.948 --> 38:05.283
Let's take it inside, huh?

38:06.367 --> 38:08.035
Not gonna get anything done out here.

38:08.703 --> 38:09.537
Yeah, okay.

38:11.289 --> 38:12.832
(sobbing continues)

38:18.546 --> 38:20.339
(siren wails)

38:24.260 --> 38:26.595
My writing hand feels paralyzed for life.

38:26.679 --> 38:28.931
I haven't done so much paperwork
since my divorce.

38:29.015 --> 38:31.100
-Don't say I didn't warn you.
-I know.

38:34.103 --> 38:36.314
So, what happens now?

38:36.397 --> 38:38.190
We go to the courts,
file a bunch of papers.

38:38.274 --> 38:39.567
-Then what?
-Well, first, uh,

38:39.650 --> 38:41.569
if you're lucky,
he'll cop at arraignment tomorrow

38:41.652 --> 38:45.489
in front of Judge Maurice "Mo, Let 'Em Go"
Schiller and be done with it.

38:45.573 --> 38:48.451
But if not, there's the preliminary,
which isn't so bad.

38:48.534 --> 38:51.746
You just answer a bunch of questions like,
what were you doing there?

38:51.829 --> 38:53.205
Have you ever seen this guy before?

38:53.289 --> 38:56.417
Uh, uh, do you always wear
that kind of perfume?

38:56.500 --> 38:59.628
What? What has the perfume got to do
with it?

38:59.712 --> 39:01.464
Well, you know
how these defense lawyers are.

39:01.547 --> 39:05.676
They always try to make it look like
you, uh, enticed the...

39:06.844 --> 39:08.679
-Oh, yeah.
-(chuckles)

39:10.389 --> 39:11.474
Well, what do you think?

39:12.600 --> 39:14.769
-Is it too enticing?
-(laughs)

39:15.186 --> 39:17.980
I can't answer that
on the grounds of self-incrimination.

39:19.065 --> 39:22.443
Anyway, there's the-- the--
the trial and the preliminary--

39:22.526 --> 39:24.278
-Are you hungry?
-Pardon?

39:25.071 --> 39:26.781
No, I'm sorry. I didn't mean anything.

39:26.864 --> 39:31.160
Well, it's a rather familiar question,
you know. I mean--

39:31.535 --> 39:33.454
No, I-- (exhales)

39:33.537 --> 39:35.998
Well, ma'am, what I'm trying to say,
Miss Hyler,

39:36.624 --> 39:38.793
is that you and I
ought to be able to go out

39:38.876 --> 39:40.878
and get something to eat,
dinner or something like that,

39:40.961 --> 39:44.048
since we're gonna be spending
so much time together,

39:44.507 --> 39:46.384
legal-wise, that is.

39:47.426 --> 39:48.636
Well, um,

39:49.470 --> 39:50.304
yeah,

39:50.888 --> 39:52.598
to answer your question, Officer,

39:53.641 --> 39:54.934
I'm famished.

39:55.267 --> 39:56.102
Famished.

39:57.895 --> 39:59.271
(engine starts)

40:00.064 --> 40:03.067
Second man came running out.
He stopped about here.

40:05.528 --> 40:06.612
We yelled for him to freeze.

40:06.695 --> 40:08.989
He turned around,
pointed the shotgun right at Neal.

40:09.490 --> 40:10.950
How much time would you say lapsed

40:11.033 --> 40:13.160
between the first gunman
and the store owner?

40:14.203 --> 40:16.664
J.D.: Couldn't have been more
than two, three seconds.

40:17.957 --> 40:21.001
Detective Washington, do you concur
with the facts that's been given?

40:22.670 --> 40:23.504
Yeah.

40:24.213 --> 40:25.589
That's exactly how it happened.

40:27.591 --> 40:29.677
Captain Furillo,
we've gotten the same account

40:29.760 --> 40:31.804
from five civilian eyewitnesses.

40:31.887 --> 40:34.723
Though I'd be a fool to guarantee
clear sailing,

40:34.807 --> 40:37.017
at this time I don't anticipate
any problems.

40:37.393 --> 40:38.769
Fine. Thanks, Lieutenant.

40:43.941 --> 40:45.276
(thunder crashing)

40:52.658 --> 40:54.118
Anything else I can do, Captain?

40:55.369 --> 40:57.663
I don't think so.
Go home and get some rest.

40:58.998 --> 41:01.375
Hey, Neal. Feel like dinner?

41:02.168 --> 41:03.043
No, man.

41:04.420 --> 41:05.254
Call you later?

41:06.338 --> 41:08.632
-Sure.
-You be at your crib?

41:08.716 --> 41:10.342
Yeah, it's okay, baby. It's okay.

41:17.892 --> 41:18.893
You really okay?

41:21.353 --> 41:22.271
Yeah, I guess.

41:24.440 --> 41:25.649
I just want you to be prepared.

41:25.733 --> 41:28.694
You're gonna get a lot of heat
from the media in the next couple of days.

41:29.612 --> 41:32.198
What can I tell 'em except the truth?

41:33.574 --> 41:36.869
Press Relations will help you with any
statements. I'll set that up tomorrow.

41:39.288 --> 41:40.247
Look, Neal, it's probably

41:40.331 --> 41:42.208
-not a lot of help--
-I know, I know.

41:44.251 --> 41:46.212
I did everything
just like I was supposed to.

41:48.380 --> 41:50.841
If I had to do it all over again,
I'd do the same thing.

41:52.551 --> 41:53.594
So what does it get me?

41:55.304 --> 41:56.555
I'm a good cop, Captain.

41:57.890 --> 41:59.475
And an innocent man is dead.

42:01.185 --> 42:02.770
And you know what's the worst part?

42:04.480 --> 42:05.481
I don't feel a thing.

42:07.316 --> 42:10.110
You will. Might be 3:00 in the morning,

42:10.194 --> 42:12.321
it might be a month from now,
but it'll hit you.

42:12.988 --> 42:14.532
You'd just better be ready for it.

42:17.701 --> 42:19.954
What about tonight?
You have someone to go home to?

42:22.289 --> 42:24.875
I just feel like spending
some time alone, Captain.

42:26.627 --> 42:28.045
I'll work it out by myself.

42:33.592 --> 42:35.594
You have my number.
Don't hesitate to use it.

42:47.856 --> 42:48.774
(sighs)

42:48.857 --> 42:51.652
(door opens, closes)

43:02.288 --> 43:05.583
-Henry?
-Uh, still nothing, Frank.

43:06.041 --> 43:08.294
All the precinct night shifts
are being briefed,

43:08.377 --> 43:11.797
all the hospitals, the bus company,

43:11.880 --> 43:13.966
the cab companies
and the driver alert program.

43:14.800 --> 43:17.595
Joyce is up here, I guess on her case.

43:18.679 --> 43:21.098
-Thanks.
-FAY: Frank? Frank.

43:21.807 --> 43:24.476
Frank, I'm sorry.
I-- I couldn't stay at home.

43:25.060 --> 43:26.687
Frank, I'm going crazy.

43:26.979 --> 43:30.774
I mean, I feel so helpless
just sitting and sitting.

43:31.442 --> 43:33.152
Where is he?

43:33.611 --> 43:35.821
Please, God,
don't let anything happen to him.

43:35.904 --> 43:38.907
-Is anybody home, in case he calls?
-Yes. My mother's there.

43:39.199 --> 43:41.535
Frank, if anything should happen...

43:43.329 --> 43:45.956
I mean, I just-- I just think
we should be together now.

43:46.040 --> 43:47.374
You want to stay here a while?

43:48.125 --> 43:49.335
If I won't be in the way.

43:49.918 --> 43:51.045
No, I want you to. Henry.

43:53.464 --> 43:56.258
How about a cup of coffee with a veteran
in these things, huh?

43:56.342 --> 43:58.802
I'd-- I'd like that, Henry.

44:02.431 --> 44:04.600
You took a cheap shot at me this morning.

44:06.143 --> 44:09.063
If you have a specific problem,
Officer Bates, perhaps we can discuss it.

44:09.146 --> 44:11.065
You're damn right
I have a specific problem.

44:11.148 --> 44:13.525
You manipulated me
and made me look like I was lying.

44:13.609 --> 44:15.194
And I wasn't lying and you knew it.

44:15.277 --> 44:17.321
Don't blame me
because you didn't do your job, Officer.

44:17.404 --> 44:18.947
Oh, great. That's perfect.

44:19.031 --> 44:21.617
That's your job, is it?
To make the truth look like lies?

44:21.700 --> 44:24.787
You care about winning, and you don't care
who you drag through the mud to do it.

44:24.870 --> 44:26.830
Officer Bates,
I want you in my office right now.

44:26.914 --> 44:27.873
-Captain--
-Now!

44:35.589 --> 44:39.593
I talked to Assistant District Attorney
Rogers this afternoon for over 20 minutes.

44:40.094 --> 44:42.846
In his expert opinion,
your testimony was shaky,

44:42.930 --> 44:44.932
unprofessional and poorly prepared.

44:45.015 --> 44:46.600
I understand it being your first trial,

44:46.684 --> 44:49.395
but all the more reason
why you should've been extra careful.

44:49.770 --> 44:52.022
She didn't have
to make me look like a jerk.

44:52.106 --> 44:53.857
She didn't make you look like anything.

44:54.608 --> 44:56.151
Again, according to ADA Rogers,

44:56.235 --> 44:59.530
her cross-examination was competent,
no more, no less.

45:01.615 --> 45:02.533
Captain...

45:04.576 --> 45:05.661
Go ahead. I'm listening.

45:08.789 --> 45:10.958
Do you think you're being completely fair?

45:12.584 --> 45:14.503
If you want to discuss fairness, Bates,

45:14.586 --> 45:15.963
let's start with your implication

45:16.046 --> 45:19.049
that my objectivity is compromised
by my personal life.

45:20.718 --> 45:23.262
That is simply unfounded on any level,
and you know it.

45:24.471 --> 45:27.599
The bottom line is that she did her job
and you didn't.

45:27.683 --> 45:29.393
I think you know that as well as I do.

45:32.521 --> 45:33.355
That's all.

45:45.242 --> 45:46.660
(dialing)

45:48.162 --> 45:48.996
Hi, Bill.

45:50.873 --> 45:51.999
Boy, don't I wish.

45:52.624 --> 45:53.792
Listen, just one thought.

45:54.418 --> 45:58.213
You know that haunted house that kids
play in over at 441 Ramsey, is it?

45:58.672 --> 46:00.549
Could you send a car over to check it out?

46:03.093 --> 46:04.178
Thanks. I appreciate it.

46:07.598 --> 46:09.183
Why didn't you tell me this morning?

46:09.683 --> 46:11.435
I was too busy trying not to go crazy.

46:12.269 --> 46:13.312
All I've been able to think about

46:13.395 --> 46:15.647
are all those phone calls I've made
over the years.

46:16.648 --> 46:19.026
Mr. and Mrs. So-And-So,
I have some bad news.

46:21.069 --> 46:23.572
I used to imagine the horror
of being on the other end.

46:24.323 --> 46:27.534
Frank, I'm sure he's fine.
I'm just sure of it.

46:29.411 --> 46:30.871
Is there anything else I can do?

46:31.789 --> 46:35.667
I just have a few loose ends
to tie up here.

46:35.751 --> 46:38.504
And then I'm gonna take Fay home
and climb a new set of walls.

46:40.714 --> 46:42.549
You get things straightened out with Lucy?

46:43.175 --> 46:44.092
She was hurt.

46:45.719 --> 46:49.014
And she was a lot closer to being right
than she got credit for.

46:50.098 --> 46:52.643
I could have made my point
without tearing her to shreds.

46:53.060 --> 46:55.229
Well, she'll be stronger herself
the next time.

46:56.814 --> 46:57.981
That's what I'm afraid of.

46:58.607 --> 46:59.483
(knocks)

47:00.984 --> 47:04.071
Frank, there's a situation out here
I think you oughta look into.

47:11.036 --> 47:12.955
-Don't go away.
-I won't.

47:13.455 --> 47:16.124
-What's the problem?
-We've got a perpetrator cited

47:16.208 --> 47:18.585
for inflicting unnecessary anxiety.

47:18.669 --> 47:21.046
I think he wants to discuss
a plea bargain.

47:26.468 --> 47:27.302
(sighs)

48:00.168 --> 48:01.003
(Fay gasps)

48:02.963 --> 48:03.964
(laughs)

48:12.681 --> 48:15.684
(closing theme playing)
