WEBVTT

00:09.300 --> 00:12.262
[narrator]  As puberty begins,
hormones are released

00:12.345 --> 00:14.597
and the sexual organs begin to change.

00:14.681 --> 00:18.977
The uterus is the center
of female reproductive activity...

00:19.060 --> 00:22.147
The uterus?
I thought girls had vaginas.

00:22.230 --> 00:24.065
I thought that, too,
but I guess they don't.

00:24.149 --> 00:26.776
Maybe vagina is, like, slang.

00:26.860 --> 00:29.154
[voice]
Did someone say "vagina"?

00:29.237 --> 00:31.197
-Oh, no, no, no. Not now.
-Fuck, yeah, now!

00:31.281 --> 00:32.866
[laughing]

00:32.949 --> 00:34.701
Go away. You are not real.

00:34.784 --> 00:38.121
You're just some hormone monster
my brain created.

00:38.204 --> 00:40.665
If I'm not real, then how come
I'm sending blood

00:40.749 --> 00:43.251
to your sweet penis right now?

00:43.334 --> 00:46.212
-[moans] Come on.
-[narrator]  The ovaries release the egg,

00:46.296 --> 00:48.381
then travel down the Fallopian tube.

00:48.465 --> 00:51.384
"Fallopian." What a savory word.

00:51.468 --> 00:54.763
Describes exactly what it is,
you know what I mean?

00:54.846 --> 00:58.141
Okay, I should tell you, this is school
and we need boundaries.

00:58.224 --> 01:01.394
If you want me to go away,
you know what you have to do.

01:01.478 --> 01:04.481
-[sighs] Jerk off--
-Jerk off, yeah, yeah, yeah! Exactly.

01:04.564 --> 01:08.234
Let's go to the bathroom and climax
into that thin toilet paper.

01:08.318 --> 01:09.152
[groans]

01:09.235 --> 01:10.862
How come in all these videos

01:10.945 --> 01:14.240
puberty for boys is like
the miracle of ejaculation

01:14.324 --> 01:16.993
and for girls we're just
a yarn ball of aching tubes?

01:17.077 --> 01:19.287
-Ew, that's gross.
-Yeah, exactly.

01:19.370 --> 01:20.747
And that's why we need equal pay.

01:20.830 --> 01:23.416
My dad says when you take
into account maternity leave,

01:23.500 --> 01:26.836
-you  do  get equal pay.
-Your dad's a scumbag DUI attorney.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.463
Yeah, and he makes bank.

01:28.546 --> 01:31.341
Too bad he can't afford tweezers
for that unibrow.

01:31.424 --> 01:33.343
-[screams] Shut up, Matthew!
-Come on, come on, come on!

01:33.426 --> 01:34.636
Wheels up in 30 seconds.

01:34.719 --> 01:36.888
Ms. Kazan, can I please go
to the bathroom, please?

01:36.971 --> 01:38.640
If you don't get out of here right now,

01:38.723 --> 01:40.683
we're gonna "Jackson Pollack"
all over your pants.

01:40.767 --> 01:42.936
-Who?
-He's a famous abstract expressionist.

01:43.019 --> 01:44.729
-Oh, my God...
-I'll take notes for you, Andrew.

01:44.813 --> 01:46.314
-Thanks, Missy.
-Let's go, let's go.

01:46.397 --> 01:47.982
-I'm coming, I'm coming.
-Not yet.

01:48.066 --> 01:50.568
That's why we gotta get
to the bathroom, sweetheart.

02:26.146 --> 02:28.356
Am I a lucky guy or what?

02:28.439 --> 02:31.234
I've got this beautiful family,
a gorgeous home,

02:31.317 --> 02:35.321
the sounds of Duke Ellington--
a great African-American American.

02:35.405 --> 02:37.907
Andrew, did you know that Duke Ellington
died in this house?

02:37.991 --> 02:40.368
I did, Dr. Birch.
This house has rhythm.

02:40.451 --> 02:43.538
That's right. What can I say?
I love cocktail facts,

02:43.621 --> 02:46.916
-and I also love this woman.
-[chuckles]

02:47.000 --> 02:49.919
Not only did she prepare
a fantastic meal

02:50.003 --> 02:52.505
and birthed three beautiful children--

02:52.589 --> 02:54.757
-no drugs.
-Oh, please. Nick slipped right out of me.

02:54.841 --> 02:56.926
-Mom, Andrew's here.
-He's family.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.887
Anyway, he shouldn't be afraid
of a vagina.

02:58.970 --> 03:02.849
-Okay, can we be excused?
-Once you pay the "snuggle tax."

03:02.932 --> 03:03.975
-Come here.
-Come here.

03:04.058 --> 03:05.810
-Mom!
-[sighs]

03:05.894 --> 03:09.105
-Oh, I could eat you alive.
-Can you not do this in front of Andrew?

03:09.188 --> 03:11.441
-You smell like fresh-buttered baby.
-Give me a whiff.

03:11.524 --> 03:14.110
-Mom, loosen your grip.
-I want to put you back up inside.

03:14.193 --> 03:15.737
Okay, we're going up now. Goodbye.

03:15.820 --> 03:19.032
Love you, Nicholas. Love you.
And you, too, Andrew.

03:19.115 --> 03:20.617
[thumps]
Ooh! Ow! Sorry.

03:20.700 --> 03:23.870
What a fantastic best friend.
The kid's dynamite.

03:24.454 --> 03:26.039
From the corner! Swish-hh!

03:26.122 --> 03:28.958
Hey, so this, like, dance on Friday,

03:29.042 --> 03:31.544
-I think I'm not gonna go.
-Oh, please. Yes, you are.

03:31.628 --> 03:34.797
I'm not gonna ask a girl.
I don't need that kind of rejection.

03:34.881 --> 03:37.425
We're gonna go as a group--
me, you, Jessi and Jay.

03:37.508 --> 03:41.179
But Jay's been bragging that
he's gonna get  fingered  at the dance.

03:41.262 --> 03:43.306
-What?
-He's gonna get fingered.

03:43.389 --> 03:46.059
Okay, first of all,
I think he's got that wrong.

03:46.142 --> 03:48.937
Either that or you have
grossly misquoted him.

03:49.020 --> 03:51.522
And Jay hasn't even kissed a girl,
I guarantee it.

03:51.606 --> 03:53.733
None of us have.
Not, you know, with tongue anyway.

03:53.816 --> 03:57.153
Of course, 'cause when you do kiss a girl,
to make it official...

03:57.237 --> 03:59.280
-There's gotta be tongue.
-Major tongue.

03:59.364 --> 04:01.199
-You want to flick your tongue around.
-Ideally.

04:01.282 --> 04:03.701
And you really want to get
your tongue underneath hers, too.

04:03.785 --> 04:06.412
Yeah, you want to get in there
like a Claritin to just dissolve.

04:06.496 --> 04:07.622
-Yeah. [chuckles]
-Yeah.

04:07.705 --> 04:10.333
-We know what we're talking about.
-It's nice to talk like men.

04:10.416 --> 04:11.626
Yeah.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.086
[bangs]

04:15.880 --> 04:16.881
Ow! It stings.

04:16.965 --> 04:18.633
But it's worth it.

04:21.302 --> 04:22.720
-[growls]
-[screams]

04:22.804 --> 04:24.222
-What are you doing?
-Oh, my God!

04:24.305 --> 04:25.139
-Hi.
-Hi.

04:25.223 --> 04:27.558
-Don't look.
-Of course. I'm not looking at all.

04:28.476 --> 04:29.811
-No! Sorry.
-Oh, my God.

04:29.894 --> 04:31.145
-Sorry for what?
-I don't know.

04:31.229 --> 04:32.397
I don't know either.

04:32.480 --> 04:33.314
[slams]

04:36.818 --> 04:39.779
You know, I actually didn't
even see anything.

04:39.862 --> 04:43.157
I don't even know
what you're talking about.

04:43.241 --> 04:45.076
Okay. Well, good night.

04:45.493 --> 04:46.494
[ticking]

04:49.414 --> 04:51.749
Knock knock. Who's there?
It's the Hormone Monster.

04:51.833 --> 04:52.667
[chuckles]

04:52.750 --> 04:54.502
No, no, no, you gotta be kidding me.

04:54.585 --> 04:56.838
-Nick is right there, sir.
-And?

04:56.921 --> 05:00.133
And I'm a good person. I wouldn't do that
laying next to a friend.

05:00.216 --> 05:03.136
-Then why am I here?
-Oh, my God, you're always right.

05:03.219 --> 05:05.096
-What the hell is wrong with me?
-Nothing.

05:05.179 --> 05:08.266
You're a perfectly normal
gross little dirtbag.

05:08.349 --> 05:11.102
Now stare at that cat clock
and massage your dinger.

05:11.185 --> 05:13.479
No. Nick's grandmother
gave him that clock.

05:13.563 --> 05:15.940
-She knew what she was doing.
-Yeah, she did.

05:16.024 --> 05:17.775
-Okay.
-Oh...

05:17.859 --> 05:19.444
What a little clock-tease.

05:19.527 --> 05:21.446
Her eyes are darting back and forth,

05:21.529 --> 05:23.531
thinking, "Meow-meow,
who's got the cream?"

05:23.614 --> 05:26.200
-Me. I've got the cream.
-Yeah.

05:26.367 --> 05:27.201
[moans]

05:27.285 --> 05:29.662
-Oh, my God.
-It's okay. It's okay.

05:29.746 --> 05:32.373
Just picture your dad's associate Susan.

05:32.457 --> 05:34.459
-[Andrew] Oh, Susan.
-[Hormone Monster] Mmm...

05:34.542 --> 05:36.836
Susan actually came to the summer outing,

05:36.919 --> 05:39.839
and she said that I was really sprouting
into a fine young man.

05:39.922 --> 05:42.216
That's right. Look at her sinewy arms.

05:42.300 --> 05:44.552
-Susan, show me your top naked.
-Yeah.

05:44.635 --> 05:46.679
-Oh, God.
-And she's got Fallopian tubes.

05:46.763 --> 05:48.598
Oh, God, okay.

05:48.681 --> 05:51.017
So, Susan, um, what's it like

05:51.100 --> 05:52.769
[grunts]
to be in human resources?

05:52.852 --> 05:53.686
Uh...!

05:54.228 --> 05:55.063
I'm done.

05:55.146 --> 05:59.734
Good night, you prince of Westchester,
you king of the tri-state area.

05:59.817 --> 06:03.988
-Wait. What do we do about the mess?
-Sleep in it, pig. Mwah.

06:08.701 --> 06:11.120
So we're not going to Jay's
to play basketball?

06:11.204 --> 06:12.872
No. Um...

06:13.456 --> 06:15.333
it turns out that I have
family stuff this weekend.

06:16.876 --> 06:19.879
Oh. Well... this is me.

06:19.962 --> 06:22.381
-I'll see you at school on Monday?
-Yeah.

06:22.465 --> 06:25.843
Totally. Uh...
have a nice rest of your weekend.

06:25.927 --> 06:29.097
-Thank you.
-Um, you're welcome.

06:29.180 --> 06:31.808
-I'll get out on the curb side now.
-Yeah, great.

06:31.891 --> 06:33.851
-Traffic side.
-Yeah, that's smart.

06:35.228 --> 06:36.604
Bye, Mrs. Birch.

06:42.318 --> 06:45.905
What's going on? I thought Andrew
was staying over all weekend.

06:45.988 --> 06:48.241
I just-- it's nothing.

06:48.324 --> 06:50.993
-Nick?
-Nicholas, we're your parents.

06:51.077 --> 06:52.954
You can tell us anything.

06:53.037 --> 06:54.622
Okay.

06:54.705 --> 06:57.375
Last night, when he was changing...

06:57.458 --> 06:58.835
I saw Andrew's penis.

06:58.918 --> 07:00.586
And now you're worried
you're a homosexual?

07:00.670 --> 07:05.550
Nicky, a man can touch another penis
or even kiss one, very lightly,

07:05.633 --> 07:08.761
and it still doesn't necessarily mean
he's a homosexual.

07:08.845 --> 07:11.305
When I was an undergraduate--
your mother knows this story--

07:11.389 --> 07:13.266
Dad, I'm not worried I'm gay.

07:13.349 --> 07:16.102
-Honey, it's fine if you are.
-It's better.

07:16.185 --> 07:19.021
And by the way, you could do
a lot worse than Andrew Glouberman.

07:19.105 --> 07:21.065
It's not that, it's Andrew's...

07:21.149 --> 07:24.235
Andrew's was... was different,

07:24.318 --> 07:27.155
like bigger and hairier.

07:27.238 --> 07:29.490
Sweetheart, Andrew's started
to become a man.

07:29.574 --> 07:30.408
That's right.

07:30.491 --> 07:32.201
He's developed secondary
sex characteristics.

07:32.285 --> 07:33.953
-He has.
-Thicker eyebrows...

07:34.036 --> 07:35.496
-Mm-hmm.
-engorged nipples.

07:35.580 --> 07:36.831
-Engorged nipples.
-Mom!

07:36.914 --> 07:40.668
His penis is changing,
from a boy penis to a man's penis.

07:40.751 --> 07:42.920
-Mom!
-And you may, like me,

07:43.004 --> 07:45.173
never have a very big penis.

07:45.256 --> 07:48.634
But if you understand a woman's body,

07:48.718 --> 07:52.180
and more importantly her emotions,
it doesn't matter.

07:52.263 --> 07:54.182
It's true, Nicky. Before I met your father

07:54.265 --> 07:56.684
I was with some men
who were very well-endowed,

07:56.767 --> 08:00.354
-and honestly, it was too much for me--
-Okay.

08:00.438 --> 08:04.233
-Your father's penis is my glass slipper.
-And you're my Cinderella.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.569
-Guys, please, stop!
-Gimme a break.

08:06.652 --> 08:09.572
I'm sure Andrew and his parents
have had very similar conversations.

08:09.655 --> 08:11.991
Eh...
I don't know about that.

08:12.074 --> 08:15.244
And then, you kinda  jhoosh  it down.

08:15.328 --> 08:18.206
Barbara, what are you doing
with my last good banana?

08:18.289 --> 08:20.458
Dr. Oz says they need to learn.

08:20.541 --> 08:22.418
Oh, he doesn't need to know anything.

08:22.502 --> 08:23.669
-Actually--
-Please, the next time

08:23.753 --> 08:27.131
you think you need to know something,
Andrew, shut your face!

08:27.215 --> 08:28.883
Now give me the banana.

08:28.966 --> 08:31.010
Jesus, it tastes like condom.

08:31.093 --> 08:32.929
Thanks a lot, Mr. Sex Maniac.

08:33.012 --> 08:34.430
[class bell ringing]

08:39.060 --> 08:40.686
-Hey.
-How's it going?

08:40.770 --> 08:42.522
-Uh, good.
-Oh, okay.

08:42.605 --> 08:44.607
[claps]
All right, look alive, you little maniacs.

08:44.690 --> 08:48.361
I bet you're all, like, completely
distracted by the big dance,

08:48.444 --> 08:50.613
which I happen to be chaperoning.

08:50.696 --> 08:52.073
You know, not a big deal.

08:52.156 --> 08:55.243
I mean, they could have asked anyone,
but, you know, I volunteered.

08:55.326 --> 08:57.787
Let's just stop talking about the dance

08:57.870 --> 09:00.373
and just focus on the fundamentals
of basketball.

09:00.456 --> 09:03.209
Oh, man,
I hope they play music we like.

09:03.292 --> 09:05.878
Bruh, I can't believe the dance
is the same night as the Knicks game.

09:05.962 --> 09:08.464
Yeah, it sucks.
Porzingis is awesome, though, right?

09:08.548 --> 09:11.133
[Andrew] Oh, yeah. For a seven-footer,
he's got an amazing shot.

09:11.217 --> 09:12.760
Either way they gotta start
playing defense.

09:12.843 --> 09:14.595
[muffled] Oh, yeah, they gotta defend
better in the paint.

09:14.679 --> 09:15.763
-What?
-I said,

09:15.846 --> 09:17.056
they gotta defend better in the paint.

09:17.139 --> 09:18.975

09:48.588 --> 09:51.215
Why would Nick push me?
Why is he being so weird?

09:51.299 --> 09:52.925
Who cares? Nick's a baby.

09:53.009 --> 09:55.261
Let's watch the sex scene
from  Dallas Buyers Club.

09:55.344 --> 09:57.847
Oh, my God, do you think
Nick saw me jerking off?

09:57.930 --> 09:59.890
I told you I shouldn't do it in his room.

09:59.974 --> 10:03.769
Or, here's an idea-- maybe he's jealous
of what a fucking man you are.

10:03.853 --> 10:05.021
You should kick his ass.

10:05.104 --> 10:08.316
Do that curbing thing where you stick
his teeth on the edge of a curb

10:08.399 --> 10:10.693
and stomp on the back of his head,
what's that called?

10:10.776 --> 10:12.486
-"Curbing"?
-Yeah, that makes sense.

10:12.570 --> 10:14.030
You should curb Nick.

10:14.113 --> 10:17.158
Now let's watch McConaughey
bang two meth heads at a rodeo,

10:17.241 --> 10:20.286
and try not to think about AIDS.

10:20.369 --> 10:21.829
-Andrew...
-Yeah?

10:21.912 --> 10:23.372
I'm thinking about AIDS.

10:24.915 --> 10:27.627
Duke? Duke Ellington?

10:27.710 --> 10:29.920
Ghost of Duke Ellington,
are you up here?

10:30.004 --> 10:33.132
Hey, hey, Nick!
[laughing]

10:33.215 --> 10:34.800
You up here for some advice?

10:34.884 --> 10:37.470
You know, sometimes, it feels like
you're the only one I can turn to.

10:37.553 --> 10:40.556
I get it, the living don't always
have all the answers.

10:40.640 --> 10:41.932
-Yeah.
-Lucky for you,

10:42.016 --> 10:44.727
I'm trapped between two realms.
[laughing]

10:44.810 --> 10:47.647
-So, what's the problem?
-Duke, I saw Andrew's penis,

10:47.730 --> 10:50.441
and it was, like, way bigger
and hairier than mine.

10:50.524 --> 10:52.652
[chuckles]
Happened to me once, too.

10:52.735 --> 10:54.695
The Cotton Club, 1938.

10:54.779 --> 10:56.989
I saw Charlie Parker's penis
in a bathroom,

10:57.073 --> 10:58.991
and, good Lord, I felt inferior.

10:59.075 --> 11:01.619
I mean, there's a reason
they called him "The Bird."

11:01.702 --> 11:02.620
What's the reason?

11:02.703 --> 11:04.497
Because his pubic hair
looked like feathers.

11:04.580 --> 11:05.956
[laughing]

11:06.040 --> 11:07.500
-So what'd you do?
-I went out

11:07.583 --> 11:10.378
and made sweet love to Eva Gabor.

11:10.461 --> 11:12.797
-No shit?
-[cackling]

11:12.880 --> 11:17.301
That's right, I balled a white woman
back when it really  meant  something.

11:17.385 --> 11:18.427
So you're saying--

11:18.511 --> 11:20.763
I'm saying, having a pretty girl
on your arm

11:20.846 --> 11:23.057
can make you feel a thousand feet tall.

11:23.140 --> 11:26.143
So I should find the prettiest girl
in school and ask her out?

11:26.227 --> 11:30.481
Bingo-bango! "Furry triangle,"
if you know what I'm saying.

11:30.564 --> 11:31.524
[chuckles]

11:31.607 --> 11:33.401
I think I do. Thanks, Duke.

11:33.484 --> 11:35.736
Happy to help, little big guy.

11:35.820 --> 11:38.239
-Shall I play you out?
-Yeah, that'd be nice.

Oh, hey, guys,
I just wanted to remind you,

11:50.209 --> 11:53.546
the theme of the dance is
"A Night in Ancient Mesopotamia."

11:53.629 --> 11:56.132
We're gonna put the "social"
back in social studies.

11:56.215 --> 11:58.175
Missy, do you mind?
I'm doing a magic trick.

11:58.259 --> 12:01.470
I love magic! It's like juggling,
but it's definitely more confrontational,

12:01.554 --> 12:02.596
that's for sure.

12:02.680 --> 12:05.015
Yeah, it's like one person
playing cards  at  you.

12:05.099 --> 12:06.642
Okay, guys, shut up.

12:06.725 --> 12:10.688
Okay, anyway, I think
I have something in my mouth.

12:13.399 --> 12:14.900
Is this your card?

12:14.984 --> 12:16.610
Wow, Jay! I could barely tell

12:16.694 --> 12:19.321
that you had the card palmed in your hand
when you reached into your mouth.

12:19.405 --> 12:21.282
-Damn it, Missy!
-If it's any consolation,

12:21.365 --> 12:24.827
I literally never gave a shit about this
from the beginning, so--

You guys are the fucking worst!

to the eighth graders.

that Brian Grazer bravery.

-Oh, no.

Hey, Olivia, this is like a stupid idea,

13:15.711 --> 13:17.880
but do you wanna, like,
go to the dance with me?

13:17.963 --> 13:20.466

Yeah. What's the big deal?

13:43.864 --> 13:45.199
You said you were going with us.

we had definitive plans.

and I think Nicky misses him.

14:42.423 --> 14:44.425
Poor kid. You know,
when I was Nicky's age

14:44.508 --> 14:46.427
I had a bald little cashew,

14:46.510 --> 14:50.014
and my friend Don Kinney,
he had this great big sausage

14:50.097 --> 14:53.142
nestled in a thick robin's nest
of pubic hair.

14:53.225 --> 14:55.144
It was something to behold.

14:55.227 --> 14:58.647
Is Don the one who only got house arrest
for insider trading?

14:58.731 --> 15:01.442
Yeah. The system is so broken.

15:14.371 --> 15:16.498
Anyway, I think this is something

15:16.582 --> 15:19.084

for themselves.

15:29.720 --> 15:32.264
I'm honestly more nervous
about seeing Andrew.

15:32.348 --> 15:35.392
-He said, "Fuck you" to me yesterday.
-Ah!

15:35.476 --> 15:39.730
I regret one fight I had
with my saxophonist, Studs Dupree.

-It got pretty ugly.
-What happened? Did you guys make up?

15:42.524 --> 15:47.655
Well, I was waiting for him to apologize,
and then he died of a heroin overdose.

15:47.738 --> 15:49.323
Wow. That must have been really tough.

15:49.406 --> 15:52.117

could you refer to me as "Nanshe"?

in ancient Sumerian silver?

16:10.386 --> 16:11.512
[laughing]

16:11.595 --> 16:13.722
I get it. Mesopotamian silver mines

16:13.806 --> 16:16.850
weren't actually operational
until the mid-Bronze Age.

16:16.934 --> 16:18.769
That's a great one.
Where's Nick?

16:18.852 --> 16:21.313
I wouldn't know.
We decided to come alone.

16:21.397 --> 16:24.608
You know, I find that being alone
is actually a great gift

16:24.692 --> 16:28.821
because it prepares you
for what real life is, um, is like.

16:28.904 --> 16:30.072
Yeah, I guess.

16:30.155 --> 16:33.617
So, what's the deal after this thing?
You guys wanna go get drinks?

16:33.701 --> 16:36.078
I don't know, go to Panera,
split a bread bowl?

16:36.161 --> 16:37.830
Yeah, no, thanks.

16:37.913 --> 16:40.582
We'll probably just go home
and grade papers.

Yeah! I mean, that's, you know... pff-fft!
That's a little harsh,

16:50.217 --> 16:52.678
but I think
we're basically on the same page.

16:52.761 --> 16:54.596

of hairspray, you psycho!

So, like, you've got an opening?
I'd love to throw my butt in the ring.

17:13.073 --> 17:15.576
-I don't like going to your house.
-Oh, no, I promise,

-Yeah, you should be psyched.

Just be prepared for some
super-intellectual conversation.

17:33.177 --> 17:35.512
-Why do you keep looking over at Andrew?
-I'm not looking at Andrew,

17:35.596 --> 17:38.057
-I'm excited for my date with Olivia.
-Of course, yeah.

17:38.140 --> 17:40.976

eyes go dead when she applies lip gloss.

-Yeah.

17:43.937 --> 17:47.775

17:50.986 --> 17:52.946
Holy shit, Olivia's hot.

17:53.030 --> 17:56.075
I'm gonna pump my pillow
full of Jay jizz later thinking about it.

17:56.742 --> 17:58.994
Oh, hey, Olivia. You want to get
a drink or something?

17:59.078 --> 18:01.330
I think they have La Croix.
It's only the coconut kind,

18:01.413 --> 18:03.082
which is a little gross,
but it's still kinda--

18:03.165 --> 18:05.334
No, sorry. Dylan.

18:05.417 --> 18:09.004
Oh-- who? I thought we were going
to this dance, like, together.

18:09.088 --> 18:12.299
No, no, no.

18:12.382 --> 18:14.009
Sorry, bro, she wants a real man.

18:14.093 --> 18:16.512
Ninth grade, top of the food chain.

18:16.595 --> 18:20.432
Um, actually, sweets and fats
are at the top of the food chain.

18:20.516 --> 18:25.229
Oh, poor Nick. He's confusing
the food pyramid with the food chain.

18:25.312 --> 18:29.900
Oh, hi, Andrew. Would you perchance
like to celebrate the autumnal equinox

18:29.983 --> 18:33.237
with a, um... with a...
with a dance with me?

18:33.320 --> 18:37.074
-Oh, I would, Missy, but--
-Hey, are you out of your goddamn mind?

18:37.157 --> 18:40.119
-This is a real girl.
-She's not a girl, she's Missy.

18:40.202 --> 18:43.247
Oh, she's a girl, and she wants
to dance with  you.

-Oh, great.

18:50.712 --> 18:53.382
We can just-- so we can start now,
'cause I know how to do it.
