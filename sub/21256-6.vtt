00:00.100 --> 00:01.698
Previously on The Fosters...

00:01.819 --> 00:03.514
I'll make you a deal. You
don't play video games,

00:03.634 --> 00:05.183
- I don't get high.
- I did get this.

00:05.303 --> 00:07.035
You guys are getting married?

00:07.155 --> 00:10.157
We're in a little bit of a situation
with Cortney. Gabe is back.

00:10.191 --> 00:12.408
You need to figure out where
she's sleeping tonight.

00:12.528 --> 00:15.114
- Cortney, your ex-girlfriend?
- So you are a human

00:15.234 --> 00:17.621
- who cares about other humans.
- Well, I care about keeping people

00:17.741 --> 00:19.499
from spreading hate. So, what can I do?

00:19.534 --> 00:21.501
If your mom said that
there was a witness...

00:21.536 --> 00:23.584
- Patrick Molloy.
- This is Gray's case.

00:23.704 --> 00:26.094
He suppressed evidence
in the initial investigation.

00:26.214 --> 00:28.181
- Did you kill Martha Johnson?
- What if I did?

00:28.301 --> 00:31.196
I am going to do everything in
my power to get Gray and Molloy.

00:31.316 --> 00:33.402
- Okay, what is your problem?
- You're a liar, Mariana.

00:33.522 --> 00:34.881
I have two things to tell you.

00:34.916 --> 00:37.117
First, I've been working out
with a roller derby team.

00:37.151 --> 00:38.919
And second, Jesus had a seizure.

00:38.953 --> 00:41.655
There are hospitals for
intensive behavioral therapy.

00:41.775 --> 00:43.499
You continue to act out like this,

00:43.619 --> 00:45.838
- and that's exactly where you're going!
- I won't go back to school.

00:45.958 --> 00:49.723
I can get my GED. I'm 16.
I can drop out, it's my life!

00:51.566 --> 00:54.022
Did you know that
dropping out of school is illegal?

00:54.142 --> 00:56.917
California is a compulsory
education state.

00:57.037 --> 00:59.272
You have to go to
school until you're 18.

00:59.307 --> 01:02.145
- What? So you're gonna arrest me?
- If I have to.

01:04.661 --> 01:05.894
Mama, seriously?

01:05.929 --> 01:08.666
The only way you can drop out
is if you pass a proficiency test.

01:08.786 --> 01:11.400
Okay, fine.

01:12.101 --> 01:14.903
Okay, then you can take the
test at school tomorrow.

01:14.938 --> 01:16.905
Great. Can I go now?

01:19.677 --> 01:21.061
Thank you.

01:21.181 --> 01:24.846
Yeah. I will be your bad
cop any day, woman.

01:26.916 --> 01:28.780
What if he passes the test?

01:28.900 --> 01:30.102
He won't.

01:30.222 --> 01:32.387
He's having problems with
memory and comprehension.

01:32.422 --> 01:34.857
The test is gonna show
that, and we can use it

01:34.891 --> 01:36.959
to make our case for getting
him an educational aide.

01:36.993 --> 01:39.328
A few days ago, you didn't think
he was ready to go back to school.

01:39.362 --> 01:42.599
Well, a couple days ago, I hadn't
threatened to send him away.

01:42.719 --> 01:45.901
I don't think being trapped in the
house is doing him or us any good.

01:45.935 --> 01:47.803
He could still refuse to go, you know.

01:47.837 --> 01:49.938
Well, if he does, I think
you should arrest him.

01:50.058 --> 01:51.653
I'm serious.

01:51.773 --> 01:54.276
It's time for a little
tough love around here.

01:57.580 --> 02:00.249
And now, they won't
even let me see Emma,

02:00.283 --> 02:02.584
which is like total bull.

02:02.619 --> 02:05.921
Because besides this with
you and her, I have no life.

02:05.955 --> 02:07.156
Well, it's...

02:07.190 --> 02:09.091
Oh, whoa, whoa. Hey,
don't-don't touch that, buddy.

02:09.125 --> 02:11.193
Mason, stay away from the tools.

02:11.227 --> 02:12.861
I'm sorry. He's hard to keep tabs on.

02:12.896 --> 02:15.364
Well, that's not a problem.
We like having him around.

02:15.398 --> 02:19.468
Oh, hey, um, I actually
have something for him

02:19.502 --> 02:21.470
if it's okay.

02:22.788 --> 02:24.309
- Donut.
- Sure.

02:24.429 --> 02:25.631
Ok. There you go.

02:25.751 --> 02:27.476
- What do you say, Mason?
- Thank you.

02:27.510 --> 02:28.844
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, buddy.

02:28.878 --> 02:31.094
And thank you again,
for letting us stay here.

02:31.214 --> 02:32.642
Yeah. Thank Stef and Lena.

02:33.457 --> 02:35.801
Okay. Well, we gotta go.

02:35.835 --> 02:38.604
'Cause they're a little judgy
at school when we're late.

02:38.638 --> 02:40.139
All right. See you guys.

02:41.341 --> 02:44.009
You know, I think what
makes them so mad is

02:44.044 --> 02:45.744
that I'm not going back to school.

02:45.779 --> 02:49.314
But I have a plan. I mean, why don't
we turn this into a business?

02:49.349 --> 02:51.183
You know, making tree houses?

02:51.217 --> 02:54.319
Uh, I mean, shouldn't you
just finish high school?

02:54.354 --> 02:56.688
No, I can get my GED just like you did.

02:56.723 --> 02:58.190
Yeah, in prison.

02:58.224 --> 03:00.067
Look, I wouldn't do anything like I did.

03:00.187 --> 03:03.796
I mean, I made a ton of
mistakes when I was your age.

03:03.830 --> 03:07.699
I think your moms are just
trying to protect you, you know?

03:07.734 --> 03:11.003
Do you think you made
a mistake with Ana?

03:11.037 --> 03:14.406
You know, like, not
trying to be with her?

03:15.675 --> 03:17.741
Yeah. Yeah, all the time.

03:18.622 --> 03:21.113
Do you ever think about
getting back together?

03:21.147 --> 03:22.648
She's with Mike.

03:22.682 --> 03:25.017
Yeah, but they're not, like, married.

03:27.888 --> 03:29.597
Here's the thing.

03:30.457 --> 03:33.492
Choices you make today can
stay with you your whole life.

03:33.526 --> 03:36.061
And as far as Ana goes, do I wish...

03:36.096 --> 03:37.796
It had been different?

03:39.199 --> 03:40.666
Yeah, I do.

03:40.700 --> 03:42.801
You know, she was my first love,

03:42.836 --> 03:46.105
maybe the only one
I'll ever have, but...

03:46.139 --> 03:47.573
It's too late.

03:47.607 --> 03:50.442
And you don't want to end up
carrying around all that regret.

03:51.784 --> 03:53.378
Trust me.

03:54.700 --> 03:56.982
Oh, thank God.

03:57.016 --> 03:59.985
- You win the lottery?
- No. I, uh, I wish.

04:00.019 --> 04:01.820
I bought a thumb drive off a kid,

04:01.855 --> 04:04.434
full of pornographic films of
boys. We tracked down one of

04:04.554 --> 04:06.983
the boys, he gave us the name
of the guy who made the videos.

04:07.103 --> 04:09.628
- PD's bringing him in.
- I don't know how you do it everyday.

04:09.748 --> 04:12.476
Yeah, me neither.

04:13.776 --> 04:16.334
- What are you doing here?
- So...

04:17.122 --> 04:19.103
I asked Ana to marry me.

04:21.975 --> 04:23.208
She said yes.

04:23.243 --> 04:25.844
Wow, congratulations. That's...

04:26.846 --> 04:28.347
That's great, Mike.

04:28.381 --> 04:30.096
You really think so?

04:30.216 --> 04:31.650
- Is she a lesbian?
- No.

04:31.684 --> 04:34.953
Then you're doing better than last time.

04:34.988 --> 04:37.122
Does-Does Brandon know?
Have you told him?

04:37.157 --> 04:39.892
Not yet, but Ana was gonna tell
the twins today, if that's all right.

04:39.926 --> 04:41.693
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

04:41.728 --> 04:44.062
Hey, Brandon's gonna be okay, right?

04:44.097 --> 04:45.762
I mean, given his history with Ana?

04:45.882 --> 04:47.766
I think he'll be happy
that you're happy.

04:47.800 --> 04:49.468
I am.

04:49.502 --> 04:50.536
Very.

05:32.756 --> 05:34.947
Since the election,
there's been a huge rise

05:34.981 --> 05:37.829
in incidents of racist, homophobic,

05:37.949 --> 05:40.519
and xenophobic harassment
across our country.

05:40.553 --> 05:42.721
We've seen graffiti
with statements like:

05:42.755 --> 05:44.456
"Make America white again."

05:44.490 --> 05:46.658
Jewish cemeteries vandalized,

05:46.693 --> 05:49.394
and kids chanting "build a wall."

05:49.429 --> 05:52.197
Shiloh McCullen has
referred to immigrants

05:52.232 --> 05:53.699
as "third-world trash,"

05:53.733 --> 05:57.970
and she said that people of color
have contributed nothing to society.

05:58.004 --> 06:00.806
If our university will not
block this woman from spewing

06:00.840 --> 06:03.675
her hateful speech on our campus,

06:03.710 --> 06:04.886
then we will.

06:05.006 --> 06:06.478
Where does the hate stop?

06:06.512 --> 06:08.347
- Here!
- Where does the hate stop?

06:08.381 --> 06:10.115
Here!

06:10.149 --> 06:11.484
You agree with that?

06:12.251 --> 06:13.478
You don't?

06:14.349 --> 06:15.671
No.

06:21.551 --> 06:22.778
Hey.

06:23.263 --> 06:26.523
I was thinking maybe we should
do something for Mike and Ana.

06:26.643 --> 06:29.072
- Like what?
- I don't know.

06:29.192 --> 06:31.203
Something to celebrate their engagement.

06:33.039 --> 06:34.573
What do you think?

06:34.607 --> 06:36.350
Uh, yeah.

06:36.470 --> 06:38.177
Totally. I think we should.

06:38.211 --> 06:39.678
All right.

06:39.713 --> 06:41.104
I'll see you later.

06:45.552 --> 06:46.722
- Hi.
- Hi.

06:46.842 --> 06:48.987
Sean, this is Aaron.
Aaron, this is Sean.

06:49.107 --> 06:50.246
Good to meet you.

06:50.366 --> 06:52.242
Aaron's in the five-year law program.

06:52.362 --> 06:56.076
Cool. I hope you'll join the
protest, if it comes to that.

06:56.196 --> 06:59.068
I don't think so. I disagree
with you all on this one.

06:59.102 --> 07:01.670
Really? You into hate speech?

07:01.705 --> 07:04.006
No. Uh, I'm into free speech.

07:04.040 --> 07:06.923
And I think the best way to fight
hate is to confront the hater,

07:07.043 --> 07:09.011
debate them publicly,
expose their ignorance.

07:09.045 --> 07:10.446
No, but it's not a debate.

07:10.480 --> 07:12.737
I mean, it's a lecture where
students aren't allowed to respond.

07:12.857 --> 07:15.150
So we're exercising our
First Amendment right

07:15.185 --> 07:18.454
to protest speech that incites
discrimination and violence.

07:18.488 --> 07:21.757
By physically blocking the
speaker from speaking?

07:21.791 --> 07:25.327
She can say all the hateful things
she wants out in the world,

07:25.362 --> 07:27.429
but why do we have to
give her a platform?

07:27.464 --> 07:29.231
So, UCSD isn't part of the world?

07:29.265 --> 07:31.033
You think it's okay
that the student group

07:31.067 --> 07:33.952
who invited Shiloh McCullen is
paying to give her that platform?

07:34.072 --> 07:35.704
She doesn't come here
for free, you know.

07:35.739 --> 07:38.888
- Progressive speakers are paid, too.
- Whatever. He doesn't get it.

07:39.008 --> 07:40.876
It's not like you have
anything to lose, right?

07:40.910 --> 07:43.212
- That's not true.
- Ah, it's okay.

07:43.246 --> 07:45.547
Just a difference of opinion.

07:45.582 --> 07:47.449
If you change your mind.

07:47.484 --> 07:48.984
- Talk later.
- Yeah.

07:53.643 --> 07:54.857
One sec.

07:54.977 --> 07:56.685
_

07:57.472 --> 07:58.827
Hello.

08:00.430 --> 08:01.864
Hi.

08:02.980 --> 08:04.767
Oh, my God. Yeah.

08:04.801 --> 08:06.835
No, yeah. I'll be right there.

08:06.870 --> 08:08.103
What?

08:08.138 --> 08:10.606
Kyle's out. He's home.

08:14.974 --> 08:17.470
*** everything to belong to you.

08:18.288 --> 08:21.549
With videos of young boys being
coached to perform sexual acts.

08:21.583 --> 08:23.271
You know anything about that?

08:23.919 --> 08:25.152
Nope.

08:25.540 --> 08:27.922
We have an expert who
can identify your voice.

08:27.956 --> 08:29.490
We have boys who can identify you,

08:29.524 --> 08:31.125
and we have a warrant to
search your apartment.

08:31.159 --> 08:33.217
What do you think we're
gonna find there?

08:33.995 --> 08:35.663
You're going down.

08:35.697 --> 08:37.855
There's nothing you can do about that.

08:39.067 --> 08:42.816
But for how long? That's partly
up to you if you cooperate.

08:47.442 --> 08:49.376
- What do you want?
- Names.

08:51.398 --> 08:53.748
Of the men you share these videos with.

09:25.180 --> 09:27.181
Ah, hey.

09:27.215 --> 09:28.549
- Hi.
- What's up?

09:28.583 --> 09:30.885
Um, is Mariana here?

09:30.919 --> 09:33.621
Ah, actually, no. She...
She's not home yet.

09:33.655 --> 09:35.523
Oh. Okay. Um...

09:36.625 --> 09:39.660
Uh, can I ask you a question?

09:39.694 --> 09:41.729
About Gabe?

09:41.763 --> 09:43.230
Sure.

09:43.265 --> 09:44.766
Do you still...

09:44.886 --> 09:47.382
Like, have feelings for him?

09:47.502 --> 09:49.136
Oh, well, what do you mean?

09:49.171 --> 09:52.192
Well, I know you're with
Mike, and he's a great guy,

09:52.541 --> 09:55.576
but if you still think about Gabe...

09:55.610 --> 09:57.211
Well, I mean, he...

09:58.317 --> 09:59.980
Still thinks about you.

10:00.015 --> 10:03.142
Oh. Uh, how-how do you know that?

10:03.262 --> 10:05.653
Uh, he told me.

10:05.687 --> 10:08.155
He said you're the only
woman that he's ever loved.

10:10.325 --> 10:12.593
Oh. Hey. What are you doing here?

10:12.627 --> 10:15.364
I just was in the neighborhood.

10:15.484 --> 10:17.431
And I thought I'd come by and say hi.

10:17.465 --> 10:19.514
Oh. Well, hi.

10:19.634 --> 10:21.101
Hi.

10:21.136 --> 10:23.973
- Okay. Samuel's coming up behind you.
- Uh, sorry, sorry.

10:24.093 --> 10:26.323
Use your ultimate! Use your ultimate!

10:26.443 --> 10:28.042
Um... Hmm.

10:28.076 --> 10:30.144
I'm sorry I suck so bad. I...

10:30.178 --> 10:32.746
Hey, I'm just glad that
you're playing with us.

10:34.613 --> 10:36.298
How about we extend our

10:36.418 --> 10:38.986
no-games, no-pot pact, like, forever?

10:39.020 --> 10:40.865
Yeah. No.

10:40.985 --> 10:42.957
You just have to learn
how to use your jungler.

10:42.991 --> 10:45.668
There's a guy on YouTube that
uploads his play sessions,

10:45.788 --> 10:48.599
and then gives tips on how to play.

10:53.802 --> 10:56.170
Keep your jungler out of sight,

10:56.204 --> 10:58.806
and use your ultimate
when you get close enough.

11:00.075 --> 11:02.943
And, combo.

11:02.978 --> 11:05.054
Boom! Sit your ass down.

11:05.174 --> 11:07.214
He's got, like, three
million subscribers?

11:07.249 --> 11:09.250
He's a big deal.

11:09.284 --> 11:11.484
The jungler is best when
he gets a stormcrown.

11:11.604 --> 11:13.754
Oh. Get off my ass, faggot.

11:13.788 --> 11:15.556
I'm not a homo, homo.

11:17.237 --> 11:18.853
You like this guy?

11:19.335 --> 11:22.162
You just... kind of have
to ignore what he says.

11:22.197 --> 11:23.552
Yeah.

11:23.999 --> 11:25.178
Why?

11:25.298 --> 11:28.028
- He's calling people faggots.
- That's right, bitch!

11:28.148 --> 11:29.870
Now go make me a sandwich.

11:29.904 --> 11:31.939
Or better yet, sit on my face.

11:31.973 --> 11:33.335
Wow.

11:44.042 --> 11:46.487
Hey, can I borrow your
phone so I can text Emma?

11:46.521 --> 11:49.346
No. I'm already in enough
trouble because of you.

11:50.625 --> 11:54.862
Hey, what do you think about
Scariana Adams Fost-gore?

11:56.124 --> 11:57.273
For what?

11:57.393 --> 11:58.932
- My derby name.
- Come on.

11:58.967 --> 12:00.701
Moms are not gonna let
you do roller derby,

12:00.735 --> 12:02.269
not after what happened to me.

12:02.304 --> 12:04.772
Hey, uh, so did you guys hear about

12:04.806 --> 12:06.760
Ana and my dad getting engaged?

12:07.509 --> 12:08.976
What?

12:09.010 --> 12:10.911
Seriously? That's so cool!

12:10.945 --> 12:14.248
I mean, you're cool with that, right?

12:14.282 --> 12:16.216
Yeah. I-I-I guess.

12:16.251 --> 12:18.118
I wonder why didn't Ana tell us.

12:18.153 --> 12:19.520
She was here earlier.

12:19.554 --> 12:21.121
So are you... Are you sure?

12:21.156 --> 12:22.489
That's what AJ told me.

12:24.659 --> 12:26.460
Uh, hang on. Hey, Grace.

12:28.258 --> 12:29.733
I wonder

12:29.853 --> 12:33.262
if Ana didn't tell us
because of what I told her.

12:34.769 --> 12:36.070
What did you say?

12:36.104 --> 12:38.611
That Gabe still loves her.

12:39.317 --> 12:40.774
- He does?
- Yeah.

12:40.809 --> 12:42.432
That's what he said to me.

12:42.841 --> 12:45.346
It'd be kind of cool if they
got back together, right?

12:45.380 --> 12:47.314
Not for Mike.

12:47.349 --> 12:51.032
Yeah, I know, but... I mean, they
were each other's first loves.

12:51.152 --> 12:54.254
Wait. That doesn't mean that
they should be together now.

12:54.289 --> 12:56.190
People rarely ever
marry their first loves.

12:57.292 --> 12:59.660
Some do. As long as
they don't screw it up.

12:59.694 --> 13:00.961
Yeah, well...

13:02.097 --> 13:05.132
I want to have lots of loves
before I get married.

13:06.120 --> 13:07.267
I don't.

13:09.137 --> 13:12.005
I-I didn't know what to say.
Gabe insisted that she stay.

13:12.040 --> 13:14.341
Yeah. It-it's okay. I get it.

13:14.376 --> 13:16.276
I would like to meet her, though.

13:17.445 --> 13:18.846
W-why?

13:18.880 --> 13:22.216
Because she's obviously gonna
be in your life because of Mason.

13:22.250 --> 13:24.501
Why don't you invite her
to our thing tonight?

13:25.120 --> 13:27.287
- Really?
- Yeah. Why not?

13:30.158 --> 13:31.949
So use a different item.

13:33.581 --> 13:35.150
Impressive.

13:35.270 --> 13:37.798
I didn't know a girl could do that.

13:37.832 --> 13:40.801
Wow. And who knew a homo could do that?

13:40.835 --> 13:43.460
And the crystal mine is ours. We win.

13:43.580 --> 13:45.139
Boom.

13:45.173 --> 13:46.740
And that's how you kick ass in Vainglory

13:46.775 --> 13:49.443
without being a misogynistic,
homophobic, douchebag.

13:49.477 --> 13:51.445
- I love it.
- It's so awesome.

13:51.479 --> 13:53.667
And now for the finishing touch.

13:54.549 --> 13:56.450
You're gonna tag him, right?

13:56.484 --> 13:58.619
Uh, yeah. We gotta
make sure he sees this.

14:01.461 --> 14:04.057
Hey, I didn't see you raised
your skill tier last week?

14:04.092 --> 14:05.492
Yeah, almost tier ten.

14:11.606 --> 14:12.833
Cort?

14:31.920 --> 14:33.391
- Okay.
- Alright.

14:41.033 --> 14:43.739
- So when did you get home?
- Couple days ago.

14:44.169 --> 14:47.104
Took a while after the judge... um,

14:47.138 --> 14:50.299
- Vacated your conviction.
- Right.

14:50.675 --> 14:53.677
We had to wait and see if they
were gonna retry me again.

14:54.346 --> 14:56.446
Well, why would they do that?

14:56.981 --> 14:59.383
Troy Johnson confessed.

14:59.417 --> 15:01.485
They never like to admit they're wrong.

15:01.519 --> 15:03.830
But you could sue them
for wrongful conviction.

15:03.950 --> 15:07.485
No. No way. I'm not gonna give
them a reason to set me up again.

15:08.493 --> 15:10.785
I'm gonna just lay low.

15:11.196 --> 15:13.995
Maybe get out of state
where they can't touch me.

15:18.203 --> 15:19.670
I'm sorry.

15:21.140 --> 15:24.308
For all the stuff that I said when
you came to see me in Folsom.

15:24.790 --> 15:27.465
I should have told you
about the money I took.

15:27.885 --> 15:29.346
It's okay.

15:32.784 --> 15:35.185
Sheila gave me some make-up, but...

15:36.187 --> 15:37.989
I can't cover it up too good.

15:39.524 --> 15:41.272
I'm gonna get it removed.

15:45.597 --> 15:47.464
Can I ask you...

15:49.434 --> 15:52.269
Why did you want me to
think you killed Martha?

15:53.805 --> 15:56.640
I guess since I'd given up on myself...

16:01.079 --> 16:03.297
I just wanted you to give up on me, too.

16:11.790 --> 16:13.290
Hey.

16:13.324 --> 16:15.058
You look snazzy.

16:15.093 --> 16:16.393
Snazzy?

16:17.462 --> 16:19.163
I'm gonna change now.

16:21.032 --> 16:22.666
Where you off to?

16:22.700 --> 16:25.569
Ah, Grace and I are
performing at an open mic.

16:25.603 --> 16:27.204
Oh, sounds fun.

16:27.238 --> 16:28.972
Cortney's coming.

16:29.007 --> 16:30.307
- Cortney?
- Yeah.

16:30.341 --> 16:33.261
Grace wants to meet her. You know...

16:34.846 --> 16:36.580
Yeah, I know.

16:36.614 --> 16:39.319
Friends close, ex-girlfriends closer.

16:40.952 --> 16:43.487
Hey, so there's something
I want to tell you.

16:48.860 --> 16:50.798
Ana and I are engaged.

16:51.329 --> 16:53.043
Yeah, I, uh, I know.

16:54.833 --> 16:56.233
You know?

16:56.267 --> 16:57.935
AJ told me at school.

17:00.071 --> 17:02.736
I'm sorry, B. I wanted you
to hear it from me first.

17:03.041 --> 17:05.002
- It's okay.
- Is it?

17:05.710 --> 17:07.332
You're okay with Ana?

17:07.720 --> 17:09.046
What do you mean?

17:09.079 --> 17:12.455
B, I know she took money from
you. But I want you to know,

17:12.576 --> 17:14.917
she's not the same person
she was when she was using.

17:14.953 --> 17:16.252
Yeah. No.

17:16.287 --> 17:18.837
- I know.
- So you're happy for me?

17:18.957 --> 17:21.493
Yeah, Dad. Of course.

17:21.960 --> 17:23.060
Good.

17:24.127 --> 17:26.130
'Cause I want you to be my best man.

17:36.979 --> 17:40.493

17:42.591 --> 17:44.637

17:46.745 --> 17:48.927

17:52.126 --> 17:53.784

17:56.375 --> 17:58.619

18:02.092 --> 18:04.463
_

18:06.362 --> 18:08.323

18:14.873 --> 18:17.412
_

18:19.782 --> 18:21.604
_

18:32.530 --> 18:34.698
Hey, Cal? Hi.

18:34.732 --> 18:36.600
How was Kyle?

18:36.634 --> 18:38.001
You saw Kyle?

18:38.036 --> 18:39.870
Yeah. He's out.

18:39.904 --> 18:42.062
And he's scared.

18:42.182 --> 18:44.808
Sheila says that he's too
afraid to leave the house.

18:44.842 --> 18:47.353
He thinks that Gray's
gonna come after him.

18:47.473 --> 18:49.246
It's so unfair what Gray did to him.

18:49.280 --> 18:50.914
He's just gonna get away with it?

18:50.949 --> 18:52.449
I'm trying to make sure that he doesn't.

18:52.483 --> 18:53.617
How?

18:57.288 --> 18:59.156
Scariana?

18:59.190 --> 19:01.124
It's my derby name.

19:01.159 --> 19:02.459

19:20.411 --> 19:23.780
Up next we have Matt Coxswain.

19:29.354 --> 19:32.122
So where did you hear about this place?

19:32.156 --> 19:33.890
Ah, Grace found it.

19:33.925 --> 19:35.811
- They have really good bagels.
- Oh.

19:40.231 --> 19:43.800
The acts are really eclectic.

19:43.920 --> 19:45.743
The plan is to work out the kinks

19:45.863 --> 19:47.771
and then play at a small club.

19:47.805 --> 19:49.706
I try to do one thing
a day that scares me.

19:49.741 --> 19:51.508
Well this is mine for the day.

19:55.246 --> 19:56.413
I'm kidding.

20:00.618 --> 20:02.886
That's so sweet of you to bring wine.

20:02.920 --> 20:04.643
Oh, yeah. I got it from work.

20:04.763 --> 20:07.724
Figured we might want some.

20:07.759 --> 20:09.459
Good thing it's a screw top.

20:15.033 --> 20:17.601
Oh, just... Just a little.
I'm a lightweight.

20:19.537 --> 20:22.806
By the way, Mason is so adorable.

20:22.840 --> 20:24.141
- You know Mason?
- Yeah.

20:24.175 --> 20:26.009
We babysat him together.

20:27.145 --> 20:28.612
Oh.

20:28.646 --> 20:30.113
How nice.

20:35.920 --> 20:37.120
Uh, cheers.

20:38.256 --> 20:39.623
Cheers.

20:54.172 --> 20:57.140
I just don't think I should
be making any trouble.

20:59.023 --> 21:00.377
You wouldn't be.

21:00.411 --> 21:03.848
But I'd, like, be wearing a wire?

21:08.319 --> 21:10.420
Yes, but I would be close by,

21:10.455 --> 21:12.723
and I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.

21:14.992 --> 21:17.728
Kyle, listen, if we get
what we need on tape,

21:18.896 --> 21:20.664
you are gonna get justice,

21:20.698 --> 21:23.015
justice that you deserve.

21:24.035 --> 21:27.270
And you're not gonna have to be
afraid of Detective Gray anymore.

anold-timey fart joke.

22:32.048 --> 22:33.224
- Seriously.
- Mm-hmm.

22:35.440 --> 22:37.033
_

22:37.153 --> 22:38.587
One of your comrades?

22:40.657 --> 22:44.136
No chance you wanna go to civil
disobedience training tomorrow?

22:44.661 --> 22:48.030
No. And I think you should be careful.

22:48.064 --> 22:49.736
Some of these protests
are turning violent.

22:49.856 --> 22:51.928
Well, that is what the training is for,

22:52.048 --> 22:54.660
to teach us how to peacefully resist.

22:54.971 --> 22:56.738
I'm just saying.

22:56.773 --> 22:58.861
Sean and his P-SAC group,

22:58.981 --> 23:00.617
they're not the most

23:00.737 --> 23:02.904
level-headed people on campus.

23:04.147 --> 23:07.435
I'm sorry about what Ximena said today.

23:08.809 --> 23:10.598
Intolerance rubs both ways.

23:10.718 --> 23:12.287
It doesn't mean I don't get it.

23:12.407 --> 23:15.524
I know. I think she just sees you as...

23:15.558 --> 23:18.427
Like a privileged, white male.

23:19.696 --> 23:23.065
Yeah, but that privilege can
be instantly taken away

23:23.099 --> 23:25.801
if I'm arrested or if I
get in a car accident.

23:25.835 --> 23:26.950
I know.

23:27.070 --> 23:29.168
But if any

23:29.288 --> 23:31.273
ICE agent asks her if she's undocumented

23:31.307 --> 23:33.175
just because she looks Latina...

23:33.209 --> 23:35.892
She's not undocumented
if she's enrolled in DACA.

23:36.012 --> 23:38.680
Okay, but they did deport
a DACA student recently,

23:38.715 --> 23:40.782
and he did nothing wrong.

23:40.817 --> 23:43.390
- Look, I'm on your side.
- No, I know, I know.

23:43.510 --> 23:45.429
But, um, she

23:45.549 --> 23:47.611
can't hide that she's Latina.

23:49.892 --> 23:51.526
You think that I'm hiding?

23:53.162 --> 23:54.262
No.

23:54.297 --> 23:56.064
It's not deceptive of me

23:56.099 --> 23:59.601
to not disclose my private
medical information.

23:59.635 --> 24:00.969
No, I am... I'm sorry.

24:01.003 --> 24:04.573
I didn't mean it that way.
I'm just saying, like...

24:04.607 --> 24:07.075
People look at you and they have no idea

24:07.110 --> 24:09.611
what you've been through or
how hard you've had to fight

24:09.645 --> 24:11.533
- to be who you really are.
- Which is why

24:11.653 --> 24:13.930
people need to talk about things,
not just dismiss each other.

24:14.050 --> 24:16.118
They need to hear from the
people they might be hurting.

24:16.152 --> 24:17.919
I don't think they wanna
hear from the other side.

24:17.954 --> 24:20.956
Or they would come to debate,
not to give paid speeches.

24:20.990 --> 24:23.019
We need to stand up against these people

24:23.139 --> 24:25.834
and stand with the people who are

24:25.954 --> 24:28.296
less protected and
fortunate than we are.

24:28.331 --> 24:32.267
Just be careful how you stand up.

24:32.301 --> 24:35.205
Because after what happened with

24:35.325 --> 24:37.639
Kyle and Diamond...

24:38.841 --> 24:41.743
This isn't the same sort of situation.

24:41.863 --> 24:43.846
And I'm not ashamed of

24:43.966 --> 24:47.003
standing up for Kyle or
for Diamond. They're both

24:47.123 --> 24:49.248
- better off because I did it.
- I'm not...

24:49.368 --> 24:52.220
And I'm not breaking the law or
putting myself in danger, okay?

24:52.255 --> 24:55.657
I'm exercising my right to
peacefully resist, okay?

24:55.691 --> 24:58.735
- So please do not patronize me.
- Wha...

25:02.465 --> 25:05.066
♪ We'll never miss ♪

25:12.775 --> 25:15.277
♪ We'll never miss ♪

25:22.115 --> 25:24.009
All right. Anyone else out there

25:24.129 --> 25:26.087
who didn't sign up,
who wants to perform?

25:26.122 --> 25:27.589
We have the place till 10:00.

25:27.623 --> 25:30.058
You guys were great.

25:30.092 --> 25:32.494
How about you in the brown dress?

25:32.528 --> 25:34.271
You look like someone who's got talent.

25:34.391 --> 25:36.598
- Oh, no, I can't sing.
- Yes, you can.

25:36.632 --> 25:38.036
No excuses now.

25:38.156 --> 25:40.869
Um, I'm not going up there alone.

25:40.903 --> 25:43.171
You should go. It'll be fun.

25:43.206 --> 25:45.040
Plus, you get two free bagels.

25:47.076 --> 25:48.443
Okay.

25:48.478 --> 25:50.242
All right.

25:51.814 --> 25:53.849
What will you two be performing?

25:54.917 --> 25:56.952
Well, um...

25:56.986 --> 25:59.774
We kind of only know one song.

26:09.298 --> 26:12.968
♪ Animal crackers in my soup ♪

26:13.002 --> 26:16.771
♪ Monkeys and rabbits loop the loop ♪

26:16.806 --> 26:20.442
♪ Gosh, oh, gee, but I have fun ♪

26:20.476 --> 26:24.212
♪ Swallowing animals one by one ♪

26:24.247 --> 26:27.782
♪ In every bowl of soup I see ♪

26:27.817 --> 26:31.520
♪ Lions and tigers watching me ♪

26:31.554 --> 26:34.723
♪ I make 'em jump right through a hoop ♪

26:34.757 --> 26:39.361
♪ Those animal crackers in my soup ♪

26:41.097 --> 26:43.665
All right. There we go.

26:54.043 --> 26:56.578
So I sort of had a fight with Aaron.

26:56.612 --> 26:59.147
Am I supposed to care?

26:59.181 --> 27:01.716
Okay, I'm sorry I went off
on you the other night,

27:01.751 --> 27:03.285
after the party.

27:04.287 --> 27:06.154
I was being judgmental.

27:06.188 --> 27:09.424
And self-righteous, and hypocritical

27:09.458 --> 27:11.610
- and...
- Okay, I'm trying to make up.

27:16.332 --> 27:17.714
Okay.

27:18.167 --> 27:19.467
I forgive you.

27:22.471 --> 27:24.472
So does Ximena know you didn't tell moms

27:24.507 --> 27:26.408
that you were practicing with the team?

27:26.442 --> 27:29.511
If I tell you, are you
gonna go off on me again?

27:29.545 --> 27:31.046
So she doesn't.

27:32.248 --> 27:34.883
I thought you needed,
like, a permission slip?

27:34.917 --> 27:37.212
I might have forged their signature.

27:37.332 --> 27:38.896
Mariana, why?

27:39.016 --> 27:42.952
Because I don't have any
friends at school anymore.

27:42.984 --> 27:45.711
And I need to feel like
I belong somewhere,

27:45.831 --> 27:47.662
that somebody wants me on their team,

27:47.697 --> 27:49.731
and everyone at derby's so
supportive of each other.

27:49.765 --> 27:52.019
I need that.

27:53.569 --> 27:55.103
Hey.

27:55.137 --> 27:57.572
Uh, I just wanted to say good night

27:57.607 --> 27:59.841
and, uh, talk to you.

27:59.875 --> 28:03.768
So, I, uh, I spoke to Mom about.

28:05.381 --> 28:07.515
I'm afraid the answer is no.

28:07.550 --> 28:09.517
I'm sorry, honey, but...

28:09.552 --> 28:13.321
after Jesus and everything
he went through with his TBI,

28:13.356 --> 28:15.849
we just can't risk you getting hurt.

28:24.467 --> 28:26.301
Whoa.

28:26.335 --> 28:27.734
You okay?

28:27.854 --> 28:29.471
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

28:29.505 --> 28:32.507
- That wine was so delicious.
- Oh.

28:32.541 --> 28:34.342
Yeah. How much did you have to drink?

28:34.377 --> 28:36.011
Not that much.

28:38.347 --> 28:39.859
I don't...

28:40.568 --> 28:41.916
- What...
- Oh.

28:41.951 --> 28:43.137
Hey.

28:43.257 --> 28:44.819
- Sorry.
- Oh.

28:44.854 --> 28:46.888
It's okay. We've all been there.

28:51.039 --> 28:52.794
You are so pretty.

28:52.828 --> 28:54.262
So are you.

28:54.296 --> 28:57.065
You guys sounded so good together.

28:57.099 --> 28:59.367
Uh... So did we. We
sounded good together.

28:59.402 --> 29:01.236
You sounded great together.

29:01.270 --> 29:02.954
- Really?
- Yeah.

29:03.074 --> 29:04.469
- Really?
- Yes.

29:05.041 --> 29:06.241
Okay.

29:06.275 --> 29:07.742
Oh.

29:07.777 --> 29:09.619
Okay.

29:12.014 --> 29:15.188
Hey, thanks for, you know,
taking care of her and stuff tonight.

29:15.308 --> 29:18.566
And for coming out, I know it's
kinda rough on a Mason-free night.

29:18.601 --> 29:21.236
I understand why she wanted to meet me.

29:21.270 --> 29:22.860
She's sweet.

29:23.506 --> 29:24.773
Young.

29:24.807 --> 29:27.709
She's a year older than me,
actually. She's just kinda...

29:27.743 --> 29:29.477
Grew up sheltered, I don't know.

29:29.512 --> 29:31.842
She's not used to
partying in bagel shops.

29:32.348 --> 29:34.077
No, it's a good thing.

29:34.917 --> 29:37.014
You're too mature sometimes.

29:40.756 --> 29:42.390
Well, good night.

29:42.425 --> 29:43.525
Night.

29:59.375 --> 30:01.288
I've been squashing trolls all day,

30:01.408 --> 30:04.746
but every time I block one,
three more pop up in its place.

30:04.780 --> 30:05.847
Yep.

30:05.881 --> 30:07.975
That's what happened when
I came out at church.

30:09.218 --> 30:10.585
It's why I hate the Internet.

30:11.620 --> 30:13.766
And someone took our
video down from YouTube.

30:14.590 --> 30:15.811
I did.

30:16.225 --> 30:17.525
Why?

30:17.560 --> 30:19.794
It's rule number one,
don't feed the trolls.

30:19.829 --> 30:22.330
But taking it down, showing
them that they've won?

30:22.365 --> 30:23.965
That's like a troll feast.

30:23.999 --> 30:26.167
Yeah, but it's my account,
I don't want the hassle.

30:26.202 --> 30:27.936
We were right to post that video.

30:27.970 --> 30:29.671
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you.

30:29.705 --> 30:32.674
Though I guess that makes us even
since you obviously broke our deal

30:32.708 --> 30:35.877
so you could raise your
tier or whatever last week.

30:35.911 --> 30:37.829
Okay, I'm sorry,

30:37.949 --> 30:40.724
but does it really matter what
I do when we aren't together?

30:41.117 --> 30:42.812
It does if you lie about it.

31:09.345 --> 31:10.412
Pat.

31:13.215 --> 31:14.434
Kyle.

31:15.184 --> 31:17.485
Oh, my God. I heard you were out.

31:18.854 --> 31:20.388
How you doin', man?

31:20.423 --> 31:22.257
I'm okay.

31:22.291 --> 31:23.958
Um, you got a sec?

31:23.993 --> 31:26.368
There's something I wanted to ask you.

31:28.631 --> 31:31.332
How come you didn't testify at my trial?

31:31.367 --> 31:33.560
Don't you remember I was
at the Boys and Girls Club?

31:33.680 --> 31:36.135
- We watched the Clippers game.
- No.

31:36.255 --> 31:39.155
That's why I didn't testify.
I didn't remember that.

31:39.275 --> 31:40.608
I'm sorry, man.

31:42.511 --> 31:45.329
You wanted me to watch it with you,

31:45.449 --> 31:46.629
alone.

31:47.550 --> 31:49.451
Now, what's all this about, man?

31:49.485 --> 31:50.931
I just want the truth.

31:52.354 --> 31:55.824
Did Detective Gray offer you
a deal not to testify for me?

31:55.858 --> 31:57.892
Look, I just want to understand.

31:57.927 --> 31:59.992
I ain't mad. I ain't gonna tell anyone.

32:00.112 --> 32:01.863
I just want the truth,

32:01.897 --> 32:04.366
and then you'll never see me again. I...

32:06.101 --> 32:07.402
I just gotta know.

32:14.543 --> 32:16.781
I don't know what you're talking about.

32:17.446 --> 32:19.834
And if you come around here again,

32:19.954 --> 32:23.159
I'm gonna call the cops. Maybe
I'll even call Gray himself.

32:24.086 --> 32:25.320
You got that?

32:45.875 --> 32:46.875
Hey.

32:48.344 --> 32:49.944
Hey.

32:49.979 --> 32:52.213
Look, I'm really sorry about last night.

32:52.248 --> 32:53.360
Me, too.

32:53.480 --> 32:57.330
I really wanna be
supportive of everything.

32:58.254 --> 32:59.888
- You mean that?
- Yes.

32:59.922 --> 33:01.022
Yeah?

33:08.564 --> 33:10.291
Do your moms know that you're here?

33:11.140 --> 33:13.034
Did you sneak out?

33:13.068 --> 33:15.403
No, no, no, I didn't. I didn't.

33:15.437 --> 33:18.006
I had to take a proficiency test,

33:18.040 --> 33:19.933
so that I can legally drop out.

33:24.113 --> 33:25.713
How'd you do?

33:25.748 --> 33:28.416
Uh, good, I think.

33:28.450 --> 33:29.632
Um,

33:29.925 --> 33:32.034
but anyway...

33:32.154 --> 33:35.401
I have something for you.

33:41.745 --> 33:43.880
I know it's not fancy,

33:44.000 --> 33:46.620
but I made it with Gabe.

33:53.175 --> 33:54.475
It's beautiful.

33:56.779 --> 33:59.480
I wanted to give it to you,

33:59.515 --> 34:01.115
as a promise ring,

34:01.150 --> 34:04.208
you know, until I can
get you something...

34:04.787 --> 34:06.254
Nicer.

34:07.656 --> 34:08.969
Emma.

34:09.400 --> 34:10.837
I don't wanna have

34:10.956 --> 34:13.606
any regrets in my life.

34:14.362 --> 34:15.964
And I know that you...

34:18.233 --> 34:20.435
You're the one,

34:20.469 --> 34:24.014
and I want to spend the
rest of my life with you.

34:29.645 --> 34:32.315
- Hi.
- You forged your permission slip?

34:33.215 --> 34:35.274
I'd like to talk to your moms.

34:42.172 --> 34:43.605
MJesus, we're...

34:43.725 --> 34:45.969
Only 16.

34:46.090 --> 34:47.413
Yeah, yeah. I know.

34:47.533 --> 34:50.507
I'm not saying that we'll
get, like, married right now.

34:50.627 --> 34:52.562
I'm gonna go to college.

34:52.596 --> 34:54.331
- Maybe far away.
- That's fine.

34:54.452 --> 34:55.884
Then I'll go wherever you're goin'.

34:56.004 --> 34:58.150
I mean, I can do construction
literally anywhere.

34:58.270 --> 35:01.333
- So much can change.
- Not if we don't let it.

35:01.972 --> 35:03.873
I want change.

35:03.907 --> 35:05.808
I want grow and learn and...

35:05.843 --> 35:08.144
We're good. We...

35:08.178 --> 35:10.784
'Cause we could do all of that together.

35:11.582 --> 35:13.742
Not if you drop out of school.

35:15.419 --> 35:17.331
Education is...

35:18.589 --> 35:21.202
Extremely important to me.

35:23.827 --> 35:26.152
And I...

35:26.272 --> 35:28.664
Can't really see myself

35:28.699 --> 35:30.992
marrying someone who's...

35:32.102 --> 35:34.432
Willfully throwing that away.

35:43.580 --> 35:46.077
Are there bruises? Yes. But they heal.

35:46.197 --> 35:49.412
And what they leave behind
is a feeling of empowerment.

35:49.532 --> 35:52.055
Roller derby is a place
you can be yourself

35:52.089 --> 35:53.790
with no judgment,

35:53.824 --> 35:55.799
where girls become brave,

35:55.919 --> 35:57.761
confident, and strong.

35:59.063 --> 36:02.529
It's like what Mom was trying
to teach me with self-defense,

36:02.649 --> 36:04.862
but it works.

36:06.103 --> 36:07.970
Okay. What about concussions?

36:08.005 --> 36:09.872
They happen, but not a lot.

36:09.907 --> 36:11.741
We've been trained in
recognizing the signs.

36:11.775 --> 36:13.391
If a girl takes a blow to the head,

36:13.511 --> 36:16.112
she's out of the bout and
examined immediately.

36:16.146 --> 36:18.848
You can fall and hit
your head anytime, Mama.

36:18.882 --> 36:20.588
I understand you're worried, but

36:20.708 --> 36:23.119
in the short time Mariana's
practiced with us,

36:23.153 --> 36:25.188
I've seen her confidence grow.

36:25.222 --> 36:27.790
I've seen a girl who I think
feels safer in the world.

36:27.825 --> 36:30.059
And I'm surrounded by
girls who look like me.

36:30.094 --> 36:33.362
I've never had a group of friends
that were all badass Latinas.

36:33.397 --> 36:35.631
And they all have my back.

36:35.666 --> 36:37.348
Derby's like a family.

36:38.435 --> 36:40.670
Please, Mama.

36:42.439 --> 36:44.440
Okay. Let me... Let me talk to Mom.

36:44.475 --> 36:46.345
Thank you.

36:47.111 --> 36:49.846
Um, we have something on campus,

36:49.880 --> 36:52.650
- so I won't be home for dinner.
- Okay.

36:55.752 --> 36:58.436
- Thank you so much.
- De nada.

36:59.356 --> 37:01.950
You need to get me a real
signed permission slip.

37:02.070 --> 37:03.926
And if you make the team,

37:03.961 --> 37:06.390
you'll sit out the first game, at least.

37:06.510 --> 37:07.630
Okay.

37:07.664 --> 37:09.432
Sorry.

37:09.466 --> 37:10.900
And thank you.

37:14.338 --> 37:15.505
Bye.

37:19.176 --> 37:20.543
Okay.

37:20.577 --> 37:22.512
You ready?

37:22.546 --> 37:25.354
Three, two, one.

37:26.116 --> 37:28.417
Hey, everyone. We're GirlAndGayGuy.

37:28.452 --> 37:30.486
And welcome to our
Vainglory play session.

37:30.521 --> 37:32.421
Our live streams are
for you guys out there

37:32.456 --> 37:34.056
who love playing the game,

37:34.091 --> 37:36.058
but without all that
other negative baggage.

37:36.093 --> 37:40.229
And to all you OzoSick Stans,
we're not afraid of you.

37:40.264 --> 37:42.899
All right, you take a lane,
I'm gonna jungle for a while.

37:42.933 --> 37:45.301
Jungler Jude, got it.

37:45.335 --> 37:47.336
I'm banning all new nicknames.

37:47.371 --> 37:50.039
Um, I'm ignoring that ban.

37:50.073 --> 37:51.670
Call out if you get rushed.

37:52.075 --> 37:54.892
- I'm gonna go and CP your weapon.
- I'm gonna CP this time,

37:55.012 --> 37:57.570
but I might change it up if
they've got a lot of defense.

37:57.690 --> 37:59.715
Looking good, looking good.

37:59.750 --> 38:01.751
Ah. Got 'em.

38:01.785 --> 38:04.844
Now don't forget to use
any help you can find.

38:06.023 --> 38:09.143
Yeah, you totally need your
allies to get into enemy territory.

38:10.093 --> 38:11.594
This is bonkers.

38:15.232 --> 38:16.899
Kyle, listen to me.

38:16.934 --> 38:19.646
I will not let anything happen
to you. I'm gonna get Molloy,

38:19.766 --> 38:21.859
and when I do, I will make
sure that he turns on Gray,

38:21.979 --> 38:24.314
- and we're gonna put 'em both away.
- I never should have done this.

38:24.434 --> 38:27.318
- I promise you.
- You've got nothing on them.

38:27.878 --> 38:29.345
How can you promise?

38:45.095 --> 38:47.797
Hey, so, I'm not gonna
drop out of school.

38:47.831 --> 38:49.396
- Hard test?
- No.

38:49.516 --> 38:52.001
Well, I mean, yeah, kind of, I guess.

38:52.035 --> 38:54.011
But no, I-I-I ran into Emma,

38:54.131 --> 38:56.424
and she won't marry me
if I don't finish school.

38:56.544 --> 38:57.945
So I'll get assessed,

38:58.065 --> 39:00.058
get a babysitter, whatever it takes.

39:05.048 --> 39:07.123
The goal of civil disobedience

39:07.243 --> 39:08.979
is nonviolent resistance

39:09.099 --> 39:11.087
to authority by the people.

39:11.121 --> 39:12.955
Gandhi used it to expel the British,

39:12.990 --> 39:15.503
and Martin Luther King used
it in the fight for civil rights.

39:15.623 --> 39:17.895
And we'll do the same
if we're not heard.

39:18.695 --> 39:20.763
All right, let's lock it up.

39:20.797 --> 39:24.634
So when a police officer lays
a hand on you, you go limp.

39:24.668 --> 39:27.772
Do not resist, but don't
help the police either.

39:27.804 --> 39:30.539
Make them carry you or drag you away.

39:30.574 --> 39:32.994
Thank you. Everyone's gonna need a plan.

39:33.114 --> 39:35.878
You need phone numbers of people
you can call to come bail you out.

39:35.912 --> 39:37.583
Wait, um... Sorry.

39:37.703 --> 39:40.237
Are saying there's a chance
we could get arrested?

39:40.357 --> 39:42.199
More than a chance.

39:42.319 --> 39:44.120
Getting arrested is the goal.

39:44.154 --> 39:46.429
- Arrests mean more attention.
- Yeah.

39:46.549 --> 39:50.126
Real change, it doesn't happen
without real resistance.

39:50.160 --> 39:53.462
Anyone here not willing to
do what needs to be done,

39:53.497 --> 39:55.564
you are welcome to leave.

39:56.667 --> 39:57.933
You okay?

40:04.174 --> 40:05.207
Hey.

40:06.410 --> 40:09.288
So, uh, has Ana told you guys

40:09.408 --> 40:11.180
- about her and my dad yet?
- No.

40:12.716 --> 40:14.724
I hope Jesus didn't confuse her.

40:15.118 --> 40:16.819
Hmm, what do you mean?

40:16.853 --> 40:20.845
I guess Gabe told him that
he still has feelings for Ana,

40:20.965 --> 40:23.462
and then, he told Ana.

40:24.127 --> 40:26.228
I'm sure there's nothing to worry about.

40:26.263 --> 40:29.109
She loves your dad, and
she obviously said yes.

40:30.233 --> 40:34.136
You know, Jesus, ever since
his TBI, he's confused.

40:34.171 --> 40:36.255
- Yeah.
- Ugh.

40:36.673 --> 40:38.489
No one ever takes the trash out.

40:39.142 --> 40:40.209
I'll do it.

40:41.311 --> 40:42.511
Thanks.

41:05.669 --> 41:06.702
