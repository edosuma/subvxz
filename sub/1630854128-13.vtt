to have a fair shot.

00:09.661 --> 00:12.099

this time, Dad.

00:12.142 --> 00:14.449
- And I've tasked
Dr. Grace Song here

00:14.492 --> 00:16.929
with finding ways to make
your jobs more efficient.

00:16.973 --> 00:19.932
- We're deciding how to use
tech so that it's empowering.

00:19.976 --> 00:22.674

me on that new EMR program.

And I really want to respect
the space that you ask for,

me know that you're all right,

00:51.703 --> 00:53.401
it's getting pretty brutal
out there.

00:53.444 --> 00:55.794

personnel who can't make it in.

looking at preeclampsia.

09:30.352 --> 09:32.136
but she's still leaking blood
from the left iliac artery.

09:32.180 --> 09:34.443
- So she needs surgery.
- Ideally, yes.

09:34.486 --> 09:37.446
But the second we open her up,
we'd release the pressure.

09:37.489 --> 09:39.622
And she'll bleed out
and likely die on the table.

09:39.665 --> 09:41.624
- So we take her to IR,
embolize the vessel.

09:41.668 --> 09:43.626
- OK. But even
if we can reach the artery--

09:43.670 --> 09:46.237
and that's a big if--
the second we do,

09:46.281 --> 09:48.892
she'd go
into hypotensive shock.

09:48.936 --> 09:50.590
- So we give blood
and resuscitate.

09:50.633 --> 09:53.897
- Which would require continued
use of massive blood products.

09:53.941 --> 09:55.464
We'd gut our supply.

09:55.507 --> 09:57.640
Until the storm blows through,
there's no telling

09:57.684 --> 09:59.990
how long it'll be
until we get re-upped again.

10:00.034 --> 10:01.296
- So how about we cut
to the point

10:01.339 --> 10:03.646
where you're recommending
a course of action?

10:03.690 --> 10:07.389
- Look, I don't want
to be a downer here, but...

10:07.432 --> 10:09.565
I ran an algorithmic simulation

10:09.609 --> 10:11.480
with inputs from patients
with a similar trauma profile.

10:11.523 --> 10:15.266
It puts Nina's odds
of survival at 7%.

10:15.310 --> 10:16.790
- So what are we gonna do?

10:16.833 --> 10:18.792
- Honestly, nothing.

10:18.835 --> 10:23.187
My recommendation would be
to transfer her to ICU

10:23.231 --> 10:24.667
and make her comfortable.

10:24.711 --> 10:26.147
- You're kidding.

10:26.190 --> 10:28.192
- If it was any other day,
I'd say go for it,

10:28.236 --> 10:31.805
but we have an obligation
to prioritize blood products

10:31.848 --> 10:33.241
and other precious resources

10:33.284 --> 10:36.026
for patients who have
the most favorable outcome.

10:36.070 --> 10:39.769
And unfortunately,
that's not her.

10:39.813 --> 10:42.685
- That kid lost both
his parents in a car accident.

10:42.729 --> 10:43.991
His aunt's
all he's got left now.

10:44.034 --> 10:45.688
- I feel you.

10:45.732 --> 10:47.472
But it's not
clinically relevant, is it?

10:47.516 --> 10:48.430
- I just thought
you should know

10:48.473 --> 10:50.301
before we orphan him again.

10:52.303 --> 10:53.653
I'm taking her to IR.

10:53.696 --> 10:55.132
And if you don't want to help,
that's fine.

10:55.176 --> 10:56.568
I'll find somebody else.

11:00.485 --> 11:02.662
- I've been trying
to reach Ben.

11:02.705 --> 11:05.186
It's his bowling night,
and I'm worried

11:05.229 --> 11:07.710
that he's out there
in the storm.

11:07.754 --> 11:10.017
I never thought that
it would take him this long

11:10.060 --> 11:11.496
to come around.

11:11.540 --> 11:13.281
I'm starting to think
that it's never going to.

11:13.324 --> 11:14.761
- Well, you know what they say.

11:14.804 --> 11:17.415
Absence makes the heart
grow fonder.

11:17.459 --> 11:19.548
Just give it some time.

11:19.591 --> 11:22.638
- Felix, how are
those frostnipped toes?

11:22.682 --> 11:24.248
- Here.

11:27.774 --> 11:29.732
- Felix?

11:29.776 --> 11:31.734
Felix?

11:31.778 --> 11:33.257
Felix?

11:34.911 --> 11:37.044
[gasps] Felix?

11:37.087 --> 11:39.176
- [grunts]

11:39.220 --> 11:40.787
- He's been stabbed.

11:49.230 --> 11:49.447
.

11:49.491 --> 11:51.885
- Stay with me, Felix.

11:51.928 --> 11:54.757
OK, I got
three clean points of entry

11:54.801 --> 11:55.932
to the lower right quadrant.

11:55.976 --> 11:57.934
I'm gonna fast him.
- I don't get it.

11:57.978 --> 11:59.066
Why was this guy moved
to the entryway?

11:59.109 --> 12:00.676
He was being treated
for frostbite.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.460
- It was frostnip.

12:02.504 --> 12:04.724
And we needed the room.

12:04.767 --> 12:05.986
- What the hell's wrong
with this thing?

12:06.029 --> 12:07.727
- I'll take a look.
- No, no, no, forget it.

12:07.770 --> 12:09.076
We gotta get him up
to CT anyway.

12:09.119 --> 12:10.686
Let's get him upstairs.
- All right, let's go.

12:10.730 --> 12:11.774
Let's move.
Let's move.

12:11.818 --> 12:13.036
Thank you.

12:14.821 --> 12:17.171
- Hey.
I heard Felix got stabbed.

12:17.214 --> 12:18.825
What happened?

12:22.698 --> 12:24.265
- CPD's been notified,

12:24.308 --> 12:26.746
but their entire department
is underwater.

12:26.789 --> 12:30.837
So it's going to be a few hours
before they can even get here.

12:30.880 --> 12:32.273
Jack.
- Yeah?

12:32.316 --> 12:34.492
- What are you
still doing here?

12:34.536 --> 12:37.495
- We got delayed finishing up
the OR 2.0 sensory upgrades,

12:37.539 --> 12:39.019
and then I couldn't get
the helicopter launched

12:39.062 --> 12:40.803
before the storm hit.

12:40.847 --> 12:43.632
So I, um--I was told
there was a stabbing.

12:43.675 --> 12:44.807
It seems awfully calm.

12:44.851 --> 12:46.504
- Well, we're trying
to keep it quiet.

12:46.548 --> 12:50.030
As far as anyone is concerned,
we had a medical emergency.

12:50.073 --> 12:52.597
- OK. Then what happens now?
- My team is pulling

12:52.641 --> 12:53.990
the surveillance footage
as we speak.

12:54.034 --> 12:58.125
But in the event
this is an active situation,

12:58.168 --> 12:59.953
I think we have
to call a code silver,

12:59.996 --> 13:01.911
evacuate the building
before anybody else gets hurt.

13:01.955 --> 13:04.261
- I'd really prefer
not to do that.

13:04.305 --> 13:07.961
A code silver would require us
to lock down the hospital

13:08.004 --> 13:11.660
and kick all of these people
back out onto the streets.

13:11.703 --> 13:12.792
- Then what are we
supposed to do?

13:12.835 --> 13:14.924
- Well, we can start by quietly

13:14.968 --> 13:17.318
notifying essential staff
of the threat.

13:17.361 --> 13:21.148
And if everyone could have just
a little situational awareness,

13:21.191 --> 13:23.367
we'd give Chief Madsen
and his team time

13:23.411 --> 13:27.937
to review the surveillance
footage and ID a suspect.

13:27.981 --> 13:29.243
- I don't know, Sharon.

13:29.286 --> 13:32.159
We might have a lunatic loose
in our hospital.

13:32.202 --> 13:33.508
I think we should
call the code.

13:33.551 --> 13:36.250
- Jack, these people
don't have anywhere to go.

13:36.293 --> 13:38.600
- I get it, but I'm not
gonna have this whole thing

13:38.643 --> 13:40.645
blowing up in my face.

13:40.689 --> 13:43.387
Shut it down.
[glass shatters]

13:43.431 --> 13:46.216
[wind howling]

13:46.260 --> 13:49.698
- I am not letting you
send people out there.

13:49.741 --> 13:51.265
And that's it.

13:56.270 --> 13:57.793
- Yeah, we've got
a couple more pickups,

13:57.837 --> 14:01.057
and the roads are a mess,
so I'd say about an hour or so?

14:01.101 --> 14:04.060
What are her liver
and kidney function numbers?

14:04.104 --> 14:07.847
- Creatinine at 1.
PC ratio of 200.

14:07.890 --> 14:09.936
Mild contractions,
and her blood pressure's

14:09.979 --> 14:12.329
persistently higher
than 140/90.

14:12.373 --> 14:13.940
- OK,
she could be preeclamptic,

14:13.983 --> 14:15.898
but we're a bit shy
of where we'd want

14:15.942 --> 14:18.248
to induce right away--
33 weeks.

14:18.292 --> 14:19.902
- Admittedly,
I'm a little out of my depth,

14:19.946 --> 14:21.599
but I am open to ideas.

14:21.643 --> 14:22.905
- Give her a shot
of betamethasone

14:22.949 --> 14:24.907
to help mature the baby's lungs

14:24.951 --> 14:26.996
and magnesium
to prevent seizures

14:27.040 --> 14:29.259
in case we are dealing
with preeclampsia.

14:29.303 --> 14:31.261
I'll be there as soon as I can.

14:31.305 --> 14:32.654
- OK. Got it.

14:32.697 --> 14:35.483
And, Hannah,
be safe out there.

14:35.526 --> 14:38.399
- I'll be there
before you know it.

14:40.314 --> 14:42.142
- We got
Clint's imaging results,

14:42.185 --> 14:43.926
which confirmed
an orbital fracture.

14:43.970 --> 14:47.016
I'm just waiting until ophtho
can get down and do a consult.

14:47.060 --> 14:50.628
- OK, yeah.
So is there anything else?

14:50.672 --> 14:53.805
- Yeah. Um...

14:53.849 --> 14:55.503
his lab results.

14:58.985 --> 15:01.335
- [sighs] All right.

15:06.340 --> 15:08.864
Hey, with me now.

15:14.478 --> 15:17.394
So do you mind telling me
what's really going on here?

15:17.438 --> 15:19.701
- What? I don't know--
- Clint's lab work.

15:19.744 --> 15:22.399
Amphetamines, benzos, opioids.

15:22.443 --> 15:24.358
I mean, that guy's got
an entire pharmacy

15:24.401 --> 15:25.925
in his bloodstream.
- OK. OK.

15:25.968 --> 15:28.144
Look, Clint called me
for a ride

15:28.188 --> 15:29.972
because he relapsed
and he got into some trouble.

15:30.016 --> 15:31.669
- Are you using again?
- No!

15:31.713 --> 15:33.323
- No, tell me the truth.

15:33.367 --> 15:35.325
- You know, this is exactly
why I didn't tell you the truth

15:35.369 --> 15:37.501
about why we were here
in the first place.

15:37.545 --> 15:39.155
When are you ever gonna
have some trust in me?

15:39.199 --> 15:40.983
- When you stop
making bad decisions.

15:41.027 --> 15:42.289
That's when.

15:44.465 --> 15:47.990
- I swear I'm clean.

15:48.034 --> 15:49.687
You don't believe me,
give me a drug test.

15:49.731 --> 15:52.168
- Maybe I will.

15:59.219 --> 16:01.221
- Advancing the catheter.

16:07.531 --> 16:09.359
- I'm barely
keeping her pressure up.

16:09.403 --> 16:12.188
- I'm working as fast as I can.
Having some issues.

16:12.232 --> 16:13.929
- All right, give an amp
of calcium and bicarb.

16:13.973 --> 16:16.236
And keep going
with the blood products.

Pulse is back.
I have ROSC.

16:33.209 --> 16:35.690
- All right.
Let's keep going.

16:35.733 --> 16:37.779
- No. I think we're done here.

16:37.822 --> 16:39.737
- What?
- I tried.

16:39.781 --> 16:42.175
The pelvic binder's in the way,
and the hematoma is too big.

16:42.218 --> 16:44.655
It's distorting the anatomy.
I can't pass the wire.

16:44.699 --> 16:47.223
- What if we loosen the binder?
- No way.

16:47.267 --> 16:48.268
As soon
as you remove the pressure,

16:48.311 --> 16:49.573
she'll bleed out on the table.

16:49.617 --> 16:51.445
- Well, come on. We have
to think of another way.

16:51.488 --> 16:54.970
- Gave it our best shot.
Sorry, Will.

16:58.974 --> 17:00.280
- Security's
still investigating.

17:00.323 --> 17:02.325
In the meantime,
we're just telling people,

17:02.369 --> 17:04.980
you know, just keep an eye out
for anything suspicious.

17:05.023 --> 17:07.590
- Wow, a stabbing.
OK, will do.

17:07.635 --> 17:10.290
- Dr. Charles, can you confirm
this pharmacy dosage, please?

17:12.117 --> 17:14.250
Thank you.

17:14.294 --> 17:15.859
Dr. Marcel.
- Yeah?

17:15.904 --> 17:18.428
- So?
- Not good.

17:18.472 --> 17:20.952
A CT scan showed that
part of the knife broke off

17:20.996 --> 17:23.954
and is lodged somewhere
in the middle of his liver.

17:23.999 --> 17:25.435
- So he's gonna need surgery?

17:25.479 --> 17:28.221
- Yeah, but he has
three tracts in the liver.

17:28.263 --> 17:30.266
From the surface,
it'll be challenging

17:30.310 --> 17:32.268
to know which one
has the retained blade.

17:32.312 --> 17:33.574
And, well,
if we go in blindly,

17:33.617 --> 17:37.012
then he could
bleed excessively.

17:37.056 --> 17:40.015
So I'm--
I'd like to go up to 2.0.

17:40.059 --> 17:42.365
I'm hoping the enhanced imaging

17:42.409 --> 17:45.107
will give us
the roadmap we need

17:45.151 --> 17:49.068
to, uh--to make the repair.

17:49.111 --> 17:50.591
- [sighs] OK.

17:50.634 --> 17:52.114
Um, I'll call upstairs

that you're on your way.

19:33.128 --> 19:34.303
Grab an arm.
- Yep.

19:34.347 --> 19:36.914
On three.
One, two, three.

19:36.958 --> 19:39.352
- Here we go.

19:39.395 --> 19:41.267
- We gotcha.
- Gotcha.

19:42.485 --> 19:44.400
- I'm dizzy.
I gotta stop for a sec.

19:44.444 --> 19:46.750
- OK, let's put him down.
- Yeah.

19:46.794 --> 19:48.709
- [groaning]

19:48.752 --> 19:50.319
- I think there's a blanket
in the back seat.

19:50.363 --> 19:51.581
Stay with him.
Keep him on his side.

19:51.625 --> 19:53.757
Watch his neck.
- Will do.

19:53.801 --> 19:55.368
We gotcha.

19:57.631 --> 20:01.200
[explosion]

20:11.340 --> 20:11.732
.

20:11.775 --> 20:14.691
[ears ringing]

20:24.223 --> 20:27.008
- Hey, Paul?

20:27.051 --> 20:28.139
Hey.

20:28.183 --> 20:30.403
Did you get hit?

20:30.446 --> 20:31.491
- I don't think so.

20:31.534 --> 20:34.320
- OK, good.

20:34.363 --> 20:37.627
Hang tight for a beat.
I'll be right back.

20:37.671 --> 20:39.412
- I think I took some shrapnel.

20:39.455 --> 20:41.022
- Oh, let me see.

20:41.065 --> 20:43.372
- [groaning]
- We got to stop the bleeding.

20:43.416 --> 20:45.896
- I have a tourniquet
in my vest.

20:50.292 --> 20:51.815
- Hold pressure.

20:51.859 --> 20:53.252
Watch your hand.

20:59.997 --> 21:01.999
That should do.

21:02.043 --> 21:04.480
I'm gonna get you
to the hospital.

21:04.524 --> 21:06.090
- None in that, you're not.

21:06.134 --> 21:07.962
- What?

21:08.005 --> 21:09.790
[busy signal trilling]

21:16.927 --> 21:19.234
- Where are you taking her?

21:19.278 --> 21:20.453
- Up to the ICU.

21:20.496 --> 21:22.324
Dr. Davis couldn't
access the vessels,

21:22.368 --> 21:23.456
just like you said.

21:23.499 --> 21:25.371
- I'm sorry, Will.

21:25.414 --> 21:26.589
- Auntie N!

21:26.633 --> 21:28.765
- Oh, easy, buddy.

21:28.809 --> 21:31.855
- Auntie N?
Is she gonna get better?

21:31.899 --> 21:34.205
- We're gonna do
everything we can for her.

21:34.249 --> 21:36.947
- It's my fault.

21:36.991 --> 21:38.862
- Lucas,
why would you say that?

21:38.906 --> 21:40.908
- She was lighting the stove
'cause of me.

21:40.951 --> 21:43.345
I was cold.
That's why she fell.

21:44.912 --> 21:46.522
- Lucas, there you are.

21:46.566 --> 21:48.437
Let's go back
to the doctor's lounge, OK?

21:48.481 --> 21:51.440
- I'm so sorry.
It's all my fault.

21:56.793 --> 21:59.361
- Will, wait a sec.

21:59.405 --> 22:01.189
What if we take her back
to the hybrid room?

22:01.232 --> 22:03.670
And if we can loosen
the pelvic binder,

22:03.713 --> 22:05.062
maybe we can find the vessels.

22:05.106 --> 22:09.415
- I thought of that.
Dr. Davis was not on board.

22:12.592 --> 22:14.333
- Then I'll do it myself.

22:17.901 --> 22:19.947
- One person said
they saw a guy

22:19.990 --> 22:22.036
in a red T-shirt
leaving the area.

22:22.079 --> 22:24.038
But there were
some inconsistencies

22:24.081 --> 22:25.082
with their account.

22:25.126 --> 22:26.388
- How about security footage?

22:26.432 --> 22:27.998
- Cameras
never came back online

22:28.042 --> 22:29.826
after we shifted over
to the backup generator.

22:29.870 --> 22:32.742
Remind me to jump down
IT's throats over that, please.

22:32.786 --> 22:34.309
- But what can we do now?

22:34.353 --> 22:36.180
We need to find out
who did this Felix.

22:36.224 --> 22:38.705
- If I had to hazard a guess,
I'd say whoever did this

22:38.748 --> 22:39.923
already exited the hospital.

22:39.967 --> 22:42.230
- At the moment,
our top priority

22:42.273 --> 22:45.581
needs to be ensuring the safety
of our patients and staff.

22:45.625 --> 22:48.802
Were you able to get in
any extra security personnel?

22:48.845 --> 22:50.325
- They're trickling in.

22:50.369 --> 22:52.283
I wanted to talk to you
about how best to deploy them.

22:52.327 --> 22:54.068
- Why don't we do
a walkthrough?

22:54.111 --> 22:57.506
- I'll fill you in
if I get any more information.

22:58.812 --> 23:01.641
- This is unacceptable.
- It is.

23:01.684 --> 23:04.339
But, look, we're gonna have
to accept the possibility

23:04.383 --> 23:06.210
that we might never
find out who did this.

23:06.254 --> 23:07.995
- Yeah, but Felix wouldn't
even have been in the entryway

23:08.038 --> 23:10.650
had I not insisted
on turfing him.

23:10.693 --> 23:13.435
- Look, you've been on
your feet for, what, 20 hours?

23:13.479 --> 23:15.481
What do you say let me
pass the brick off to Doris

23:15.524 --> 23:16.395
and you get some rest?

23:16.438 --> 23:17.918
- No, I'm gonna power through.

23:17.961 --> 23:20.094
- Doctor's orders, then.
- Daniel.

23:20.137 --> 23:22.488
- Margaret,
I'm not messing around here.

23:22.531 --> 23:25.447
I'm worried about you.
You need some sleep.

23:30.713 --> 23:32.236
Thank you.

23:44.553 --> 23:48.035
- Still can't tell
where the retained fragment is.

23:48.078 --> 23:49.558
2.0, rotate the image

23:49.602 --> 23:51.908
to feature
the right hepatic lobe.

23:53.910 --> 23:55.695
[2.0's alarm blaring]

23:55.738 --> 23:57.218
What's this?

23:57.261 --> 24:00.351
- Intentional motions
are at 74% efficiency

24:00.395 --> 24:01.962
compared
to your normal metrics.

24:02.005 --> 24:03.398
- What are you talking about?

24:03.442 --> 24:06.009
- You're too fatigued
to continue operating.

24:06.053 --> 24:07.837
- You're kidding, right?

24:07.881 --> 24:10.405
I've done hundreds of cases
far more exhausted than this.

24:10.449 --> 24:12.538
- It's recommended
you have another surgeon

24:12.581 --> 24:13.669
complete the operation.

24:13.713 --> 24:14.627
- There is no other surgeon.

24:14.670 --> 24:16.019
- I can take over.

24:16.063 --> 24:17.499
I just started my shift
a few of hours ago.

24:17.543 --> 24:18.892
I'm plenty rested.

24:18.935 --> 24:20.415
- You're not qualified.
You're a junior resident.

24:20.459 --> 24:22.896
I need you to override the
system and give me my image.

24:22.939 --> 24:24.288
- I can't.

24:24.332 --> 24:26.073
Mr. Dayton upgraded the code

24:26.116 --> 24:27.466
to make it impossible
to override.

24:27.509 --> 24:29.163
- Then get Jack up here
to do it.

24:29.206 --> 24:30.817
- You're wasting your breath.

24:30.860 --> 24:32.296
He doesn't want
anyone operating

24:32.340 --> 24:34.255
at a capacity
below the system's threshold.

24:34.298 --> 24:37.171
- This is ridiculous!
I-I feel fine!

24:37.214 --> 24:38.477
- I can do it.

24:40.957 --> 24:43.133
- Damn it.

24:43.177 --> 24:45.396
- Under your supervision,
of course.

24:49.618 --> 24:53.274
- 2.0, transfer primary surgeon
to Dr. Tanaka-Reed.

24:53.317 --> 24:55.363
Focus on the right lower lobe.

24:59.759 --> 25:01.630
Your show.

25:09.464 --> 25:11.901
- Katie's platelet count
dropped to 70,000.

25:11.945 --> 25:14.164
And her LFTs doubled.
Mag level was 7.

25:14.208 --> 25:16.079
- All right, we're gonna
need to induce labor.

25:16.123 --> 25:17.559
All right,
start her on oxytocin

25:17.603 --> 25:19.518
and restart the mag
at 1 gram an hour

25:19.561 --> 25:22.433
as long as she's doing better
and her reflexes are back.

25:22.477 --> 25:24.697
Oh, any ETA yet on Dr. Asher?

25:24.740 --> 25:26.612
- Just got off with OEMC.

25:26.655 --> 25:28.701
Seems she encountered a trauma
in the field.

25:28.744 --> 25:31.312
- What kind of trauma?
- He didn't have any details.

25:31.355 --> 25:32.922
Only that
the guard vehicle was disabled

25:32.966 --> 25:35.185
and they were having difficulty
finding transport.

25:35.229 --> 25:36.578
Thought
it might be another hour.

25:36.622 --> 25:38.885
- An hour? How is she
gonna survive out there

25:38.928 --> 25:41.365
for that long in this cold?

25:41.409 --> 25:43.324
All right, you know what?
I'm gonna pick her up myself.

25:43.367 --> 25:45.544
Where'd they say she was at?
- Canal and Lumber.

25:45.587 --> 25:47.284
- [screaming]

25:47.328 --> 25:49.504
- I'm sorry, Dr. Archer,
but Katie's delivering.

25:49.548 --> 25:53.029
- Right now? She's only
one centimeter dilated.

25:54.465 --> 25:55.815
I want you staying on this guy

25:55.858 --> 25:58.121
until Hannah gets back here
safe and sound.

25:58.165 --> 25:59.688
- All right.
You got it.

26:02.909 --> 26:06.913
- [panting]

26:06.956 --> 26:09.350
You think this is serious?

26:09.393 --> 26:11.657
- Why?
You got big weekend plans?

26:11.700 --> 26:13.615
- Actually, I do.

26:13.659 --> 26:17.227
My fiancée and I are supposed
to have cake tasting.

26:17.271 --> 26:18.838
I'm getting married next month.

26:18.881 --> 26:21.362
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

26:21.405 --> 26:23.190
- Well, don't worry.

26:23.233 --> 26:24.365
I'll make sure
you're fixed up in time

26:24.408 --> 26:27.237
to walk down that aisle.

26:28.543 --> 26:30.197
How you doing back there, Paul?

26:30.240 --> 26:31.720
- I don't know.

26:31.764 --> 26:33.679
It hurts pretty bad
when I breathe.

26:33.722 --> 26:37.030
- OK, let me
take a look at you.

26:37.073 --> 26:39.032
- [groaning]
- OK.

26:39.075 --> 26:41.034
Where's the pain?
- My side.

26:41.077 --> 26:43.819
- Your side?
Give me your flashlight.

26:50.173 --> 26:51.610
I'm gonna lift up your shirt.

26:51.653 --> 26:53.133
- Uh-huh.

26:53.176 --> 26:55.526
- OK, it looks
like the shrapnel

26:55.570 --> 26:56.919
might have penetrated
your chest well.

26:56.963 --> 26:58.617
Hold that for me.

26:58.660 --> 27:00.314
Do you have
any medical supplies?

27:00.357 --> 27:04.623
- Uh, no, but there's
a toolbox under your seat.

27:17.244 --> 27:19.725
- Hey, that--that bag,
hand it to me.

27:21.117 --> 27:23.598
OK, here.

27:23.642 --> 27:25.339
All right, Paul.

27:25.382 --> 27:27.689
You have a hole in your lung.

27:27.733 --> 27:29.082
I'm gonna
stabilize your breathing

27:29.125 --> 27:31.258
with an airtight patch.

27:31.301 --> 27:34.609
- That's your patch?
- Yes.

27:34.653 --> 27:36.655
Here we go.

27:36.698 --> 27:39.701
It's going to conform
to your body contour

27:39.745 --> 27:42.530
to create a better seal.

27:42.573 --> 27:44.314
All right.

27:44.358 --> 27:46.839
Now take a big inhale for me.
- [inhales deeply]

27:46.882 --> 27:48.318
- That better?
- Mm-hmm.

27:48.362 --> 27:50.277
- OK, good. Good.

27:50.320 --> 27:51.974
Good, good, good.

27:52.018 --> 27:54.411
There we go.

27:54.455 --> 27:56.239
The cavalry better
get here soon.

27:56.283 --> 27:57.545
- Yeah.

28:02.724 --> 28:03.116
.

28:03.159 --> 28:05.118
- This is all the blood
we have left.

28:06.946 --> 28:10.819
- Do you think
we should use it?

28:10.863 --> 28:13.866
- We don't have a choice.

28:13.909 --> 28:14.910
- All right.

28:14.954 --> 28:17.173
[machinery beeping rapidly]

28:17.217 --> 28:18.522
- A-line pressure's down.

28:18.566 --> 28:20.481
I don't think
we're gonna make it.

28:20.524 --> 28:22.657
- I only need
another 30 seconds.

28:22.701 --> 28:25.007
I'm almost there.

28:25.051 --> 28:27.053
All right.
Come on. Come on.

28:27.096 --> 28:30.447
Come on, Nina.

28:30.491 --> 28:31.797
I'm in.

28:31.840 --> 28:34.060
Launching the coil.

28:41.110 --> 28:42.721
[machinery beeping steadily]

28:42.764 --> 28:44.287
- Pressure's coming up.

28:46.594 --> 28:47.813
- All right.

28:47.856 --> 28:50.250
Let's get her up to the ICU.

28:52.513 --> 28:54.428
- Hi.
You've reached Ben Campbell.

28:54.471 --> 28:56.212
Leave a message
after the beep.

28:56.256 --> 28:59.041
[beep]
- I, um...

28:59.085 --> 29:02.175
[pounding on door]

29:07.833 --> 29:10.052
- [whimpering]

29:13.099 --> 29:14.578
- Are you all right?

29:14.622 --> 29:16.406
- [stammering]
It is so cold.

29:16.450 --> 29:19.279
- What happened?
- I slipped on the ice.

29:19.322 --> 29:21.803
- OK. Come on.
Let's get you inside.

29:21.847 --> 29:24.632
- [groaning in pain]

29:24.675 --> 29:26.808
- OK. Oh, my God.

29:26.852 --> 29:28.897
You're frozen.

29:28.941 --> 29:30.333
How long
were you out there for?

29:30.377 --> 29:32.466
- I don't know,
a couple of hours maybe.

29:32.509 --> 29:35.599
- OK, stay right there.
Stay right there.

29:40.691 --> 29:42.215
Let me take a look
at your ankle.

29:42.258 --> 29:43.782
- No!
- OK.

29:43.825 --> 29:45.305
I'm gonna go get a wheelchair,

29:45.348 --> 29:48.177
and we're gonna get your ankle
all fixed up, OK?

29:48.221 --> 29:50.136
OK, stay right here.

29:53.661 --> 29:56.577
- It feels like
there's a boulder on my chest.

29:56.620 --> 29:58.405
- OK.

29:58.448 --> 29:59.798
OK.

29:59.841 --> 30:03.018
All right, when you feel
that pressure building up,

30:03.062 --> 30:05.891
I want you to just
pull that flap back, OK?

30:05.934 --> 30:08.241
Try that for me.

30:08.284 --> 30:10.025
- [inhales deeply]

30:10.069 --> 30:11.592
- OK?
- Uh-huh.

30:11.635 --> 30:12.593
- Good.

30:16.118 --> 30:18.207
Hey. Is that EMS?

30:20.906 --> 30:24.257
[horn honking]

30:24.300 --> 30:26.389
- Looks like a civilian.

30:36.704 --> 30:39.489
- Sorry. I got here
as soon as I could.

30:39.533 --> 30:41.230
- Were you looking for us?

30:41.274 --> 30:42.841
- I was in the ED
with a friend of mine

Sean Archer.

30:49.238 --> 30:52.502
- Wait. Dean's son?
- That's right.

30:52.546 --> 30:55.723

30:55.766 --> 30:59.466
Well, let's get these guys
in your truck.

30:59.509 --> 31:01.729
OK.

31:01.772 --> 31:05.298
- Katie, I know delivery didn't
go exactly as you'd planned,

31:05.341 --> 31:08.040
but, uh, your baby
looks healthy and strong.

31:08.083 --> 31:10.825
- Isn't he? Hmm?

31:10.869 --> 31:12.566
I was so worried.

31:12.609 --> 31:14.046
- Because
he was born prematurely,

31:14.089 --> 31:17.397
we're gonna have to have him
evaluated up in the NICU.

31:17.440 --> 31:18.746
It's a perfectly
normal protocol.

31:18.789 --> 31:22.097
Nothing to be concerned about.
- OK.

31:26.667 --> 31:28.408
[baby whimpering]

31:28.451 --> 31:30.889
And what about
the preeclampsia?

31:30.932 --> 31:33.848
- Well, in most cases,
it's resolved by giving birth.

31:33.892 --> 31:35.763
We'll keep an eye on that,
but in the meantime,

31:35.806 --> 31:37.199

transferred upstairs

31:37.243 --> 31:39.245

a lot more comfortable.

Thank you both.

- Sure.

31:47.818 --> 31:50.299

That was my first delivery.

31:50.343 --> 31:51.387

Unfortunately, it is broken.

32:36.737 --> 32:38.521
I don't think
you'll need surgery,

32:38.565 --> 32:42.308

until ortho can weigh in.

why she stabbed Felix?

33:37.972 --> 33:39.669

talking too much

33:39.713 --> 33:41.367
and in her personal space.

33:41.410 --> 33:43.586
- What, she stabbed a guy
for being a close talker?

Last time she was here,
she was on thorazine,

33:51.246 --> 33:52.856
but that's, like,
ten years ago.

33:52.900 --> 33:54.075
I'm pretty sure
she has not had

33:54.119 --> 33:55.946
any kind
of consistent care since.

33:55.990 --> 33:58.601
Without her meds,
she's gonna be very volatile.

34:00.647 --> 34:01.996

- Hey, Jack.

- Hmm?
- You got a minute?

34:07.871 --> 34:09.438
- Yeah, of course.
Excuse me.

34:14.313 --> 34:16.619

- Yeah, let's.

Now, I'm told that it delivered
another tremendous success.

34:19.231 --> 34:20.884

- Yeah.

an inexperienced surgeon

34:22.886 --> 34:24.279
through
a complicated procedure.

34:24.322 --> 34:25.976
Yeah,
I'd chalk that up as a win.

34:26.020 --> 34:27.848
- Sure, the patient
had a good outcome,

34:27.891 --> 34:30.981
but 2.0 glitched again,
Jack, big-time.

though, sir.

locking surgeons out

34:39.338 --> 34:43.646
because of some preprogrammed
metric of fitness,

34:43.690 --> 34:45.170

2.0 is a tool that was
designed to help surgeons,

from doing their job.

to be disabled.

disagree with you there.

Now, look, I was told
that you had some difficulty

34:57.182 --> 35:00.359
with this thing earlier, yeah?

35:00.402 --> 35:03.449
- Uh, I couldn't
get it to work.

35:03.492 --> 35:05.190
Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

35:05.233 --> 35:08.323
Well, maintenance
took a look at it, and...

35:08.367 --> 35:12.632
yeah, it turns out
that it was working just fine.

35:16.114 --> 35:18.072
- Well, it wasn't working
when I tried it.

35:18.116 --> 35:20.770
Look, regardless,
it was an emergent situation.

35:20.814 --> 35:22.163
I was in a rush.
- Or could it be

35:22.207 --> 35:26.036
that maybe you were more
fatigued than you realized?

35:26.080 --> 35:27.342
Now look,
it's common for all of us,

35:27.386 --> 35:30.258
maybe even top surgeons,
to underestimate

35:30.302 --> 35:32.869
the effects of fatigue
on our reflexes and judgment.

35:32.913 --> 35:35.307
But isn't it great
to have a tool

35:35.350 --> 35:37.918
that can take all the guesswork
out of it?

in a motor vehicle crash.

37:20.934 --> 37:22.544
- I'm sorry.
Who are you?

37:22.588 --> 37:24.285

who just performed

37:24.329 --> 37:27.245
a miracle cardiac bypass
with only two units of blood.

37:27.288 --> 37:28.507
