WEBVTT

00:05.396 --> 00:05.570
.

00:05.614 --> 00:06.832
- Sean's being paroled.

00:06.876 --> 00:08.051
- That's great.

00:08.095 --> 00:09.618
- I just want him
to have a fair shot.

00:09.661 --> 00:12.099
- I want to do it right
this time, Dad.

00:12.142 --> 00:14.449
- And I've tasked
Dr. Grace Song here

00:14.492 --> 00:16.929
with finding ways to make
your jobs more efficient.

00:16.973 --> 00:19.932
- We're deciding how to use
tech so that it's empowering.

00:19.976 --> 00:22.674
- I wonder if you might train
me on that new EMR program.

00:22.718 --> 00:24.850
[dramatic music]

00:24.894 --> 00:26.417
- The longer we don't talk,

00:26.461 --> 00:28.158
the bigger
the divide between us becomes.

00:28.202 --> 00:29.507
- Maggie, you lied to me.

00:29.551 --> 00:32.249
- [strained]
I'm not gonna give up on us.

00:35.644 --> 00:37.559
- Hi.
You've reached Ben Campbell.

00:37.602 --> 00:39.126
Leave a message
after the beep.

00:39.169 --> 00:41.345
[beep]
- Hey.

00:41.389 --> 00:44.827
I know this is the third
message that I'm leaving.

00:44.870 --> 00:47.134
And I really want to respect
the space that you ask for,

00:47.177 --> 00:51.660
but if you can text me and let
me know that you're all right,

00:51.703 --> 00:53.401
it's getting pretty brutal
out there.

00:53.444 --> 00:55.794
And...OK.

00:55.838 --> 00:59.711
Uh, love you. Bye.

00:59.755 --> 01:00.669
[indistinct chatter]

01:00.712 --> 01:02.627
- You hurt?

01:02.671 --> 01:04.542
Injured?
- Mm-mm.

01:04.586 --> 01:06.283
- Stay to the right
and settle in.

01:06.327 --> 01:09.156
Someone will swing by
with a blanket soon.

01:09.199 --> 01:11.941
- Hey. What's our count?
- Pushing 60.

01:11.984 --> 01:14.422
- 60?
And it's not even 10:00.

01:18.078 --> 01:20.471
- Hey. How long are we supposed
to keep letting people in?

01:20.515 --> 01:22.691
- Well, the worst of the storm
is still ahead of us.

01:22.734 --> 01:26.390
The weather center is expecting
70-mile-an-hour winds

01:26.434 --> 01:28.392
and at least ten inches of ice.

01:28.436 --> 01:30.568
If we don't open our doors,

01:30.612 --> 01:32.831
most of these people
won't survive the night.

01:32.875 --> 01:34.181
- I understand,
but, look, pretty soon

01:34.223 --> 01:35.791
we're just gonna be
standing room only here.

01:35.834 --> 01:38.794
- Well, we're setting up cots
and the entryway

01:38.837 --> 01:39.925
for the overflow.

01:39.969 --> 01:41.275
- What about our patients?

01:41.318 --> 01:43.277
I'm short doctors,
and everyone I do have

01:43.320 --> 01:44.800
is coming off a double
with no end in sight.

01:44.843 --> 01:47.324
- Well, I just got word
from the governor's office.

01:47.368 --> 01:49.587
The National Guard
will be making runs,

01:49.631 --> 01:52.764
picking up essential medical
personnel who can't make it in.

01:52.808 --> 01:55.332
Look, I know
this isn't easy, Dr. Archer,

01:55.376 --> 01:57.987
but I promise,
reinforcements are coming.

01:58.030 --> 02:00.381
- All right.
[power shorts]

02:00.424 --> 02:04.298
Well, I guess,
if you don't believe in omens.

02:04.341 --> 02:06.213
- Hey, Mags, let me know
when my OR is ready.

02:06.256 --> 02:07.475
I'm gonna grab a coffee.

02:07.518 --> 02:09.564
- You've been on your feet
for 72 hours now.

02:09.607 --> 02:10.869
Might want to make it a double.

02:10.913 --> 02:12.567
- Tell me about it.

02:12.610 --> 02:15.352
- Dr. Halstead,
we've got incoming.

02:15.396 --> 02:18.964
You're going to Baghdad.
Can you give Dr. Song a hand?

02:19.008 --> 02:20.052
- I'll see what I can do.

02:20.096 --> 02:21.619
- Thank you.

02:23.230 --> 02:24.535
- So Dayton's got you
in the trenches

02:24.579 --> 02:26.320
with us grunts tonight, huh?

02:26.363 --> 02:28.713
- He's concerned you're
running out of ammo, yeah.

02:30.628 --> 02:32.891
- We're going to Baghdad.
Where's the ambo?

02:32.935 --> 02:35.285
- The tires started
spinning out in the driveway.

02:35.329 --> 02:37.113
- Nina Simonds,
53 years old.

02:37.156 --> 02:39.855
Carbon monoxide exposure
from lighting an old gas stove.

02:39.898 --> 02:42.466
Fell from a third-story window
trying to vent the apartment.

02:42.510 --> 02:44.251
That's her nephew, Lucas.
No complaints.

02:44.293 --> 02:46.253
- Tubed in the ambo
for GCS of 5.

02:46.296 --> 02:48.385
Gross deformities
on the left arm and leg.

02:48.429 --> 02:49.778
18-gauge in each arm.

02:49.821 --> 02:51.562
Total of 500 milliliters
of normal saline.

02:51.606 --> 02:53.999
Heart rate 120,
BP 104/78.

02:54.043 --> 02:56.480
- She's hypotensive.
- She's bleeding somewhere.

02:56.524 --> 02:58.221
Two units of blood
on the rapid transfuser

02:58.265 --> 03:00.005
and an X-ray,
chest and pelvis.

03:00.049 --> 03:02.660
On my count.
One, two, three.

03:08.405 --> 03:09.841
Thanks, guys.

03:11.800 --> 03:14.803
OK?
- Yep.

03:14.846 --> 03:16.283
- We were getting dizzy.

03:16.326 --> 03:18.676
She was just trying
to let in some fresh air.

03:18.720 --> 03:21.375
- OK. Good to know, Lucas.
Don't worry.

03:21.418 --> 03:23.333
We're gonna take good care
of your aunt, all right?

03:23.377 --> 03:24.595
Doris?
- Hey.

03:24.639 --> 03:27.250
Let's get you looked at, OK?

03:27.294 --> 03:28.947
- Lungs are clear bilaterally,

03:28.991 --> 03:31.298
but pressure's fallen
to 90 systolic.

03:31.341 --> 03:33.213
- OK. Let's get an ABG,
2 grams of TXA.

03:33.256 --> 03:36.390
And, Dr. Song, fast her.
- On it.

03:36.433 --> 03:40.481
[machinery beeping]

03:46.922 --> 03:48.793
- I don't see any fluid.

03:48.837 --> 03:50.969
- Me neither.

03:51.013 --> 03:52.275
- That's weird.

03:52.319 --> 03:54.059
She's already sucked down
two units of blood,

03:54.103 --> 03:55.670
and her pressure hasn't budged.

03:55.713 --> 03:57.237
- X-ray.

04:04.244 --> 04:05.288
- Chest looks good.

04:05.332 --> 04:06.942
Mike, get her pelvis quickly.

04:09.597 --> 04:12.252
Open-book pelvic fracture.
It's completely shattered.

04:12.295 --> 04:13.383
- She's falling.
- OK.

04:13.427 --> 04:14.906
Let's get a binder
on her pelvis now.

04:14.950 --> 04:17.300
We need to lock it down
before she bleeds out.

04:17.344 --> 04:19.433
Let's go.

04:30.226 --> 04:33.011
You set?
- Don't wait for me.

04:33.055 --> 04:34.709
- Tighten it.

04:36.319 --> 04:37.712
- Looks closed.

04:37.755 --> 04:41.498
[machinery beeping steadily]
- Pressure's coming up.

04:41.542 --> 04:45.110
Let's get another X-ray
and keep pushing blood.

04:45.154 --> 04:46.982
- That was close.

04:47.025 --> 04:48.984
[power shuts down]

04:49.027 --> 04:51.943
[distressed chatter]

04:51.987 --> 04:58.950
â™ª

05:09.439 --> 05:10.832
- So it looks like

05:10.875 --> 05:13.661
the storm took out
the West Loop substation.

05:13.704 --> 05:15.793
Anyone experience disruptions

05:15.837 --> 05:18.143
to ventilators,
monitoring equipment?

05:18.187 --> 05:20.972
- No, no, no, everything kicked
over to emergency backup.

05:21.016 --> 05:22.800
- All right, good.
Let's all get back to work.

05:22.844 --> 05:25.237
I'll keep you informed
as we get updates.

05:25.281 --> 05:28.328
Maggie, let's start getting
everyone who's stable

05:28.371 --> 05:29.764
into the entryway.

05:29.807 --> 05:31.505
They can hunker down there
for the night.

05:31.548 --> 05:33.376
- All right.

05:33.420 --> 05:36.858
- 1979, You remember that one?
God, I remember that one.

05:36.901 --> 05:39.861
4 degrees, 22 3/4 inches.

05:39.904 --> 05:40.862
- Wow.
- Yeah.

05:40.905 --> 05:42.211
But then there was 2012.

05:42.254 --> 05:45.345
16 1/4 inches,
10 below zero.

05:45.388 --> 05:47.695
Cold, very cold.
But tonight is much colder.

05:47.738 --> 05:49.044
- You know what then?

05:49.087 --> 05:50.698
It's really good
that you came in when you did.

05:50.741 --> 05:52.439
- Yeah, good.
No, good for sure.

05:52.482 --> 05:54.179
- Felix, tell me how are you
doing with your lithium?

05:54.223 --> 05:55.398
Are you taking it regularly?

05:55.442 --> 05:57.531
- Yeah, pretty much.

05:57.574 --> 05:59.794
- Pretty much?

05:59.837 --> 06:01.709
OK. Well, then,
let me ask you.

06:01.752 --> 06:02.971
How are you dealing
with the change of seasons?

06:03.014 --> 06:04.755
You know, the shorter days,
the darker days?

06:04.799 --> 06:07.062
Are you holding up OK?
- It's never easy.

06:07.105 --> 06:08.759
I try, but--
[knocks at door]

06:08.803 --> 06:10.065
Hi.
- Hey there, Felix.

06:10.108 --> 06:11.632
How are those toes feeling?

06:11.675 --> 06:13.373
- Slowly but surely getting
better, as the saying goes.

06:13.416 --> 06:15.505
Slowly but surely.
- Great. Great.

06:15.549 --> 06:17.986
Dr. Charles, can I speak
with you for a moment?

06:18.029 --> 06:19.944
- Be right back.
- Yeah.

06:23.383 --> 06:25.733
- I've got a cot ready
for him in the entryway.

06:25.776 --> 06:26.951
- He's already got a bed.

06:26.995 --> 06:28.736
- I can't tie up a room
all night

06:28.779 --> 06:31.042
for some frostnipped toes.

06:31.086 --> 06:33.262
- Thing is, though, Mags,
Felix is bipolar II

06:33.305 --> 06:35.090
with history of noncompliance.

06:35.133 --> 06:36.831
I just don't think
that's an ideal situation

06:36.874 --> 06:38.049
for him out there.

06:38.093 --> 06:39.311
- Well, we don't
really have a choice.

06:39.355 --> 06:41.313
We have patients
with greater need.

06:41.357 --> 06:42.314
- OK.

06:48.146 --> 06:50.279
- Excuse me, Dr. Archer.
- Yeah?

06:50.322 --> 06:52.586
- 26-year-old male
with an eye injury,

06:52.629 --> 06:54.109
possible orbital fracture.

06:54.152 --> 06:55.457
I can put in the orders,

06:55.502 --> 06:57.329
but I thought
you might want to see this one.

06:57.373 --> 06:59.462
- What? Why?

06:59.506 --> 07:01.072
[sighs]

07:03.988 --> 07:05.816
Sean?
- Oh. Hey, Dad.

07:05.860 --> 07:07.339
- Hey. Are you hurt?
- No, I'm fine.

07:07.383 --> 07:09.472
It's Clint, my roommate
from the reentry center.

07:09.516 --> 07:11.909
- I heard a lot about you,
Mr. Archer.

07:11.953 --> 07:14.608
- It's Doctor.
- Right.

07:14.651 --> 07:15.913
- So what happened?

07:15.957 --> 07:17.480
- I was picking up
some essentials

07:17.524 --> 07:18.655
before the storm hit--

07:18.699 --> 07:21.353
you know, eggs, milk, and such.

07:21.397 --> 07:24.182
Got jumped leaving
the Mariano's over on Wabash.

07:24.226 --> 07:25.662
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

07:25.706 --> 07:28.012
It must have been,
like, ten dudes.

07:28.056 --> 07:30.058
Didn't have a chance.

07:30.101 --> 07:32.495
Sean was nice enough
to pick me up in his four-by.

07:32.539 --> 07:35.237
- Well, that's my boy.

07:35.280 --> 07:36.891
Let's see what's going on.

07:36.933 --> 07:39.197
- [groans]

07:39.241 --> 07:41.983
- Can you see out of it?
- Yeah, but kind of blurry.

07:42.026 --> 07:44.072
- It's really swollen.

07:44.115 --> 07:46.814
All right, well,
keep ice on it and get a CT.

07:46.857 --> 07:48.598
Can I talk to you for a minute?

07:50.644 --> 07:54.517
OK. What are you doing?
City's on lockdown.

07:54.561 --> 07:55.866
- He needed help.

07:55.909 --> 07:57.346
- Well, then get somebody else
to bail them out.

07:57.389 --> 07:59.174
You got no business driving
around in an ice storm,

07:59.217 --> 08:00.305
especially after curfew.

08:00.349 --> 08:02.003
All it'll take
is one violation

08:02.046 --> 08:03.395
to land you back in county.

08:03.439 --> 08:04.701
- He's my friend.

08:04.745 --> 08:05.702
I couldn't just leave him
out there to freeze.

08:05.746 --> 08:06.921
- Sean--
- Dr. Archer.

08:06.964 --> 08:09.184
You have an OB patient
in treatment six.

08:09.227 --> 08:10.664
- Where's Dr. Asher?

08:10.707 --> 08:12.970
- She couldn't get her car
out of the garage.

08:15.930 --> 08:19.063
- Don't go anywhere.

08:19.107 --> 08:21.936
Let's add a tox screen
to those labs.

08:23.328 --> 08:25.592
Hi. You must be Katie?
- Uh-huh.

08:25.635 --> 08:28.246
- Hi. I'm Dr. Archer.
This is Dr. Hudgins.

08:28.290 --> 08:30.771
I see you're experiencing
mild contractions

08:30.814 --> 08:32.076
and some dizziness.

08:32.120 --> 08:33.381
- I almost fell off the ladder

08:33.424 --> 08:34.818
undressing my Christmas tree.

08:34.861 --> 08:36.211
- Mm.

08:36.254 --> 08:38.169
Well, I like
the festive spirit, Katie,

08:38.212 --> 08:40.868
but Christmas in February?

08:40.911 --> 08:43.217
- I know.
I'm a little behind schedule.

08:43.260 --> 08:45.176
I've been a bit preoccupied.

08:45.220 --> 08:46.395
- When is your due date?

08:46.438 --> 08:48.571
- Not for another seven weeks.

08:48.615 --> 08:50.573
I was hoping
he'd hold off long enough

08:50.617 --> 08:52.706
for my husband
to get back from Auckland.

08:52.749 --> 08:56.274
- Your contractions
could just be Braxton-Hicks.

08:56.318 --> 08:57.798
So there's nothing
to worry about.

08:57.841 --> 09:00.540
But I see that your blood
pressure is slightly elevated.

09:00.583 --> 09:02.150
- What does that mean?

09:02.193 --> 09:04.413
- Hopefully, it's just
a response to the pain.

09:04.456 --> 09:06.720
But we could be
looking at preeclampsia.

09:06.763 --> 09:07.982
- Oh, God.

09:08.025 --> 09:09.984
- Well, hang tight.
Stay warm.

09:10.027 --> 09:12.290
Before anybody jumps
to conclusions,

09:12.334 --> 09:14.771
I'm gonna have lab work done
and OB weigh in.

09:14.815 --> 09:17.252
- Thank you.

09:25.434 --> 09:27.436
- Nina Simonds' latest scans.

09:27.479 --> 09:30.308
As you can see, binder's
holding pressure on her pelvis,

09:30.352 --> 09:32.136
but she's still leaking blood
from the left iliac artery.

09:32.180 --> 09:34.443
- So she needs surgery.
- Ideally, yes.

09:34.486 --> 09:37.446
But the second we open her up,
we'd release the pressure.

09:37.489 --> 09:39.622
And she'll bleed out
and likely die on the table.

09:39.665 --> 09:41.624
- So we take her to IR,
embolize the vessel.

09:41.668 --> 09:43.626
- OK. But even
if we can reach the artery--

09:43.670 --> 09:46.237
and that's a big if--
the second we do,

09:46.281 --> 09:48.892
she'd go
into hypotensive shock.

09:48.936 --> 09:50.590
- So we give blood
and resuscitate.

09:50.633 --> 09:53.897
- Which would require continued
use of massive blood products.

09:53.941 --> 09:55.464
We'd gut our supply.

09:55.507 --> 09:57.640
Until the storm blows through,
there's no telling

09:57.684 --> 09:59.990
how long it'll be
until we get re-upped again.

10:00.034 --> 10:01.296
- So how about we cut
to the point

10:01.339 --> 10:03.646
where you're recommending
a course of action?

10:03.690 --> 10:07.389
- Look, I don't want
to be a downer here, but...

10:07.432 --> 10:09.565
I ran an algorithmic simulation

10:09.609 --> 10:11.480
with inputs from patients
with a similar trauma profile.

10:11.523 --> 10:15.266
It puts Nina's odds
of survival at 7%.

10:15.310 --> 10:16.790
- So what are we gonna do?

10:16.833 --> 10:18.792
- Honestly, nothing.

10:18.835 --> 10:23.187
My recommendation would be
to transfer her to ICU

10:23.231 --> 10:24.667
and make her comfortable.

10:24.711 --> 10:26.147
- You're kidding.

10:26.190 --> 10:28.192
- If it was any other day,
I'd say go for it,

10:28.236 --> 10:31.805
but we have an obligation
to prioritize blood products

10:31.848 --> 10:33.241
and other precious resources

10:33.284 --> 10:36.026
for patients who have
the most favorable outcome.

10:36.070 --> 10:39.769
And unfortunately,
that's not her.

10:39.813 --> 10:42.685
- That kid lost both
his parents in a car accident.

10:42.729 --> 10:43.991
His aunt's
all he's got left now.

10:44.034 --> 10:45.688
- I feel you.

10:45.732 --> 10:47.472
But it's not
clinically relevant, is it?

10:47.516 --> 10:48.430
- I just thought
you should know

10:48.473 --> 10:50.301
before we orphan him again.

10:52.303 --> 10:53.653
I'm taking her to IR.

10:53.696 --> 10:55.132
And if you don't want to help,
that's fine.

10:55.176 --> 10:56.568
I'll find somebody else.

11:00.485 --> 11:02.662
- I've been trying
to reach Ben.

11:02.705 --> 11:05.186
It's his bowling night,
and I'm worried

11:05.229 --> 11:07.710
that he's out there
in the storm.

11:07.754 --> 11:10.017
I never thought that
it would take him this long

11:10.060 --> 11:11.496
to come around.

11:11.540 --> 11:13.281
I'm starting to think
that it's never going to.

11:13.324 --> 11:14.761
- Well, you know what they say.

11:14.804 --> 11:17.415
Absence makes the heart
grow fonder.

11:17.459 --> 11:19.548
Just give it some time.

11:19.591 --> 11:22.638
- Felix, how are
those frostnipped toes?

11:22.682 --> 11:24.248
- Here.

11:27.774 --> 11:29.732
- Felix?

11:29.776 --> 11:31.734
Felix?

11:31.778 --> 11:33.257
Felix?

11:34.911 --> 11:37.044
[gasps] Felix?

11:37.087 --> 11:39.176
- [grunts]

11:39.220 --> 11:40.787
- He's been stabbed.

11:49.230 --> 11:49.447
.

11:49.491 --> 11:51.885
- Stay with me, Felix.

11:51.928 --> 11:54.757
OK, I got
three clean points of entry

11:54.801 --> 11:55.932
to the lower right quadrant.

11:55.976 --> 11:57.934
I'm gonna fast him.
- I don't get it.

11:57.978 --> 11:59.066
Why was this guy moved
to the entryway?

11:59.109 --> 12:00.676
He was being treated
for frostbite.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.460
- It was frostnip.

12:02.504 --> 12:04.724
And we needed the room.

12:04.767 --> 12:05.986
- What the hell's wrong
with this thing?

12:06.029 --> 12:07.727
- I'll take a look.
- No, no, no, forget it.

12:07.770 --> 12:09.076
We gotta get him up
to CT anyway.

12:09.119 --> 12:10.686
Let's get him upstairs.
- All right, let's go.

12:10.730 --> 12:11.774
Let's move.
Let's move.

12:11.818 --> 12:13.036
Thank you.

12:14.821 --> 12:17.171
- Hey.
I heard Felix got stabbed.

12:17.214 --> 12:18.825
What happened?

12:22.698 --> 12:24.265
- CPD's been notified,

12:24.308 --> 12:26.746
but their entire department
is underwater.

12:26.789 --> 12:30.837
So it's going to be a few hours
before they can even get here.

12:30.880 --> 12:32.273
Jack.
- Yeah?

12:32.316 --> 12:34.492
- What are you
still doing here?

12:34.536 --> 12:37.495
- We got delayed finishing up
the OR 2.0 sensory upgrades,

12:37.539 --> 12:39.019
and then I couldn't get
the helicopter launched

12:39.062 --> 12:40.803
before the storm hit.

12:40.847 --> 12:43.632
So I, um--I was told
there was a stabbing.

12:43.675 --> 12:44.807
It seems awfully calm.

12:44.851 --> 12:46.504
- Well, we're trying
to keep it quiet.

12:46.548 --> 12:50.030
As far as anyone is concerned,
we had a medical emergency.

12:50.073 --> 12:52.597
- OK. Then what happens now?
- My team is pulling

12:52.641 --> 12:53.990
the surveillance footage
as we speak.

12:54.034 --> 12:58.125
But in the event
this is an active situation,

12:58.168 --> 12:59.953
I think we have
to call a code silver,

12:59.996 --> 13:01.911
evacuate the building
before anybody else gets hurt.

13:01.955 --> 13:04.261
- I'd really prefer
not to do that.

13:04.305 --> 13:07.961
A code silver would require us
to lock down the hospital

13:08.004 --> 13:11.660
and kick all of these people
back out onto the streets.

13:11.703 --> 13:12.792
- Then what are we
supposed to do?

13:12.835 --> 13:14.924
- Well, we can start by quietly

13:14.968 --> 13:17.318
notifying essential staff
of the threat.

13:17.361 --> 13:21.148
And if everyone could have just
a little situational awareness,

13:21.191 --> 13:23.367
we'd give Chief Madsen
and his team time

13:23.411 --> 13:27.937
to review the surveillance
footage and ID a suspect.

13:27.981 --> 13:29.243
- I don't know, Sharon.

13:29.286 --> 13:32.159
We might have a lunatic loose
in our hospital.

13:32.202 --> 13:33.508
I think we should
call the code.

13:33.551 --> 13:36.250
- Jack, these people
don't have anywhere to go.

13:36.293 --> 13:38.600
- I get it, but I'm not
gonna have this whole thing

13:38.643 --> 13:40.645
blowing up in my face.

13:40.689 --> 13:43.387
Shut it down.
[glass shatters]

13:43.431 --> 13:46.216
[wind howling]

13:46.260 --> 13:49.698
- I am not letting you
send people out there.

13:49.741 --> 13:51.265
And that's it.

13:56.270 --> 13:57.793
- Yeah, we've got
a couple more pickups,

13:57.837 --> 14:01.057
and the roads are a mess,
so I'd say about an hour or so?

14:01.101 --> 14:04.060
What are her liver
and kidney function numbers?

14:04.104 --> 14:07.847
- Creatinine at 1.
PC ratio of 200.

14:07.890 --> 14:09.936
Mild contractions,
and her blood pressure's

14:09.979 --> 14:12.329
persistently higher
than 140/90.

14:12.373 --> 14:13.940
- OK,
she could be preeclamptic,

14:13.983 --> 14:15.898
but we're a bit shy
of where we'd want

14:15.942 --> 14:18.248
to induce right away--
33 weeks.

14:18.292 --> 14:19.902
- Admittedly,
I'm a little out of my depth,

14:19.946 --> 14:21.599
but I am open to ideas.

14:21.643 --> 14:22.905
- Give her a shot
of betamethasone

14:22.949 --> 14:24.907
to help mature the baby's lungs

14:24.951 --> 14:26.996
and magnesium
to prevent seizures

14:27.040 --> 14:29.259
in case we are dealing
with preeclampsia.

14:29.303 --> 14:31.261
I'll be there as soon as I can.

14:31.305 --> 14:32.654
- OK. Got it.

14:32.697 --> 14:35.483
And, Hannah,
be safe out there.

14:35.526 --> 14:38.399
- I'll be there
before you know it.

14:40.314 --> 14:42.142
- We got
Clint's imaging results,

14:42.185 --> 14:43.926
which confirmed
an orbital fracture.

14:43.970 --> 14:47.016
I'm just waiting until ophtho
can get down and do a consult.

14:47.060 --> 14:50.628
- OK, yeah.
So is there anything else?

14:50.672 --> 14:53.805
- Yeah. Um...

14:53.849 --> 14:55.503
his lab results.

14:58.985 --> 15:01.335
- [sighs] All right.

15:06.340 --> 15:08.864
Hey, with me now.

15:14.478 --> 15:17.394
So do you mind telling me
what's really going on here?

15:17.438 --> 15:19.701
- What? I don't know--
- Clint's lab work.

15:19.744 --> 15:22.399
Amphetamines, benzos, opioids.

15:22.443 --> 15:24.358
I mean, that guy's got
an entire pharmacy

15:24.401 --> 15:25.925
in his bloodstream.
- OK. OK.

15:25.968 --> 15:28.144
Look, Clint called me
for a ride

15:28.188 --> 15:29.972
because he relapsed
and he got into some trouble.

15:30.016 --> 15:31.669
- Are you using again?
- No!

15:31.713 --> 15:33.323
- No, tell me the truth.

15:33.367 --> 15:35.325
- You know, this is exactly
why I didn't tell you the truth

15:35.369 --> 15:37.501
about why we were here
in the first place.

15:37.545 --> 15:39.155
When are you ever gonna
have some trust in me?

15:39.199 --> 15:40.983
- When you stop
making bad decisions.

15:41.027 --> 15:42.289
That's when.

15:44.465 --> 15:47.990
- I swear I'm clean.

15:48.034 --> 15:49.687
You don't believe me,
give me a drug test.

15:49.731 --> 15:52.168
- Maybe I will.

15:59.219 --> 16:01.221
- Advancing the catheter.

16:07.531 --> 16:09.359
- I'm barely
keeping her pressure up.

16:09.403 --> 16:12.188
- I'm working as fast as I can.
Having some issues.

16:12.232 --> 16:13.929
- All right, give an amp
of calcium and bicarb.

16:13.973 --> 16:16.236
And keep going
with the blood products.

16:16.279 --> 16:17.889
[machinery beeping rapidly]

16:17.933 --> 16:19.543
- Lost pulse.
She's arresting.

16:19.587 --> 16:22.068
- Starting compressions.
Push a milligram of epi.

16:25.288 --> 16:26.420
Push it.

16:26.463 --> 16:27.725
- Epi's in.

16:27.769 --> 16:29.379
[machinery beeping steadily]

16:29.423 --> 16:32.208
Pulse is back.
I have ROSC.

16:33.209 --> 16:35.690
- All right.
Let's keep going.

16:35.733 --> 16:37.779
- No. I think we're done here.

16:37.822 --> 16:39.737
- What?
- I tried.

16:39.781 --> 16:42.175
The pelvic binder's in the way,
and the hematoma is too big.

16:42.218 --> 16:44.655
It's distorting the anatomy.
I can't pass the wire.

16:44.699 --> 16:47.223
- What if we loosen the binder?
- No way.

16:47.267 --> 16:48.268
As soon
as you remove the pressure,

16:48.311 --> 16:49.573
she'll bleed out on the table.

16:49.617 --> 16:51.445
- Well, come on. We have
to think of another way.

16:51.488 --> 16:54.970
- Gave it our best shot.
Sorry, Will.

16:58.974 --> 17:00.280
- Security's
still investigating.

17:00.323 --> 17:02.325
In the meantime,
we're just telling people,

17:02.369 --> 17:04.980
you know, just keep an eye out
for anything suspicious.

17:05.023 --> 17:07.590
- Wow, a stabbing.
OK, will do.

17:07.635 --> 17:10.290
- Dr. Charles, can you confirm
this pharmacy dosage, please?

17:12.117 --> 17:14.250
Thank you.

17:14.294 --> 17:15.859
Dr. Marcel.
- Yeah?

17:15.904 --> 17:18.428
- So?
- Not good.

17:18.472 --> 17:20.952
A CT scan showed that
part of the knife broke off

17:20.996 --> 17:23.954
and is lodged somewhere
in the middle of his liver.

17:23.999 --> 17:25.435
- So he's gonna need surgery?

17:25.479 --> 17:28.221
- Yeah, but he has
three tracts in the liver.

17:28.263 --> 17:30.266
From the surface,
it'll be challenging

17:30.310 --> 17:32.268
to know which one
has the retained blade.

17:32.312 --> 17:33.574
And, well,
if we go in blindly,

17:33.617 --> 17:37.012
then he could
bleed excessively.

17:37.056 --> 17:40.015
So I'm--
I'd like to go up to 2.0.

17:40.059 --> 17:42.365
I'm hoping the enhanced imaging

17:42.409 --> 17:45.107
will give us
the roadmap we need

17:45.151 --> 17:49.068
to, uh--to make the repair.

17:49.111 --> 17:50.591
- [sighs] OK.

17:50.634 --> 17:52.114
Um, I'll call upstairs

17:52.158 --> 17:53.594
and let them know
that you're on your way.

17:53.637 --> 17:57.380
You get another cup of coffee.
- Yeah.

18:03.082 --> 18:05.780
- Liver injuries are brutal.

18:05.823 --> 18:08.043
Poor Felix.
[sighs]

18:08.087 --> 18:09.305
I know it's chaotic tonight,

18:09.349 --> 18:10.915
but how does something
like this happen?

18:10.959 --> 18:14.136
- Doris, please.

18:14.180 --> 18:16.095
This is not helpful.

18:21.796 --> 18:25.669
[machinery beeping rapidly]

18:25.713 --> 18:27.932
- What happened?

18:27.976 --> 18:28.933
- Pressure is falling.

18:28.977 --> 18:30.196
- Oh, man.

18:30.239 --> 18:31.675
Hang with me.
Hang with me, Katie.

18:31.719 --> 18:34.113
All right.

18:34.156 --> 18:37.333
Reflexes close to absent.

18:37.377 --> 18:39.161
Diminished urine output.

18:39.205 --> 18:40.684
All right.
Let's hold the magnesium.

18:40.728 --> 18:43.818
Give 500 cc fluid bolus
of lactated ringers.

18:43.861 --> 18:46.473
And let's repeat all her labs,
including a mag level.

18:46.516 --> 18:47.822
- Copy.

18:47.865 --> 18:48.779
- Where the hell is Hannah?

18:48.823 --> 18:51.782
[dramatic music]

18:51.826 --> 18:58.746
â™ª

19:03.620 --> 19:05.492
- [sighs]
This doesn't look good.

19:05.535 --> 19:07.102
- No, we gotta get him
out of there.

19:07.146 --> 19:08.408
- Yeah.

19:14.109 --> 19:16.416
Hey.
- Hey.

19:16.459 --> 19:18.853
What's your name?
- Paul.

19:18.896 --> 19:22.335
- Paul,
take a few deep breaths for me.

19:22.378 --> 19:25.773
OK. Are you OK?
Are you in pain?

19:25.816 --> 19:27.340
- No.
- No?

19:27.383 --> 19:30.212
No? Do you think
you can walk, Paul?

19:30.256 --> 19:31.648
- I think so.
- OK.

19:31.692 --> 19:33.084
Good, 'cause we're
gonna get you out of here.

19:33.128 --> 19:34.303
Grab an arm.
- Yep.

19:34.347 --> 19:36.914
On three.
One, two, three.

19:36.958 --> 19:39.352
- Here we go.

19:39.395 --> 19:41.267
- We gotcha.
- Gotcha.

19:42.485 --> 19:44.400
- I'm dizzy.
I gotta stop for a sec.

19:44.444 --> 19:46.750
- OK, let's put him down.
- Yeah.

19:46.794 --> 19:48.709
- [groaning]

19:48.752 --> 19:50.319
- I think there's a blanket
in the back seat.

19:50.363 --> 19:51.581
Stay with him.
Keep him on his side.

19:51.625 --> 19:53.757
Watch his neck.
- Will do.

19:53.801 --> 19:55.368
We gotcha.

19:57.631 --> 20:01.200
[explosion]

20:11.340 --> 20:11.732
.

20:11.775 --> 20:14.691
[ears ringing]

20:24.223 --> 20:27.008
- Hey, Paul?

20:27.051 --> 20:28.139
Hey.

20:28.183 --> 20:30.403
Did you get hit?

20:30.446 --> 20:31.491
- I don't think so.

20:31.534 --> 20:34.320
- OK, good.

20:34.363 --> 20:37.627
Hang tight for a beat.
I'll be right back.

20:37.671 --> 20:39.412
- I think I took some shrapnel.

20:39.455 --> 20:41.022
- Oh, let me see.

20:41.065 --> 20:43.372
- [groaning]
- We got to stop the bleeding.

20:43.416 --> 20:45.896
- I have a tourniquet
in my vest.

20:50.292 --> 20:51.815
- Hold pressure.

20:51.859 --> 20:53.252
Watch your hand.

20:59.997 --> 21:01.999
That should do.

21:02.043 --> 21:04.480
I'm gonna get you
to the hospital.

21:04.524 --> 21:06.090
- None in that, you're not.

21:06.134 --> 21:07.962
- What?

21:08.005 --> 21:09.790
[busy signal trilling]

21:16.927 --> 21:19.234
- Where are you taking her?

21:19.278 --> 21:20.453
- Up to the ICU.

21:20.496 --> 21:22.324
Dr. Davis couldn't
access the vessels,

21:22.368 --> 21:23.456
just like you said.

21:23.499 --> 21:25.371
- I'm sorry, Will.

21:25.414 --> 21:26.589
- Auntie N!

21:26.633 --> 21:28.765
- Oh, easy, buddy.

21:28.809 --> 21:31.855
- Auntie N?
Is she gonna get better?

21:31.899 --> 21:34.205
- We're gonna do
everything we can for her.

21:34.249 --> 21:36.947
- It's my fault.

21:36.991 --> 21:38.862
- Lucas,
why would you say that?

21:38.906 --> 21:40.908
- She was lighting the stove
'cause of me.

21:40.951 --> 21:43.345
I was cold.
That's why she fell.

21:44.912 --> 21:46.522
- Lucas, there you are.

21:46.566 --> 21:48.437
Let's go back
to the doctor's lounge, OK?

21:48.481 --> 21:51.440
- I'm so sorry.
It's all my fault.

21:56.793 --> 21:59.361
- Will, wait a sec.

21:59.405 --> 22:01.189
What if we take her back
to the hybrid room?

22:01.232 --> 22:03.670
And if we can loosen
the pelvic binder,

22:03.713 --> 22:05.062
maybe we can find the vessels.

22:05.106 --> 22:09.415
- I thought of that.
Dr. Davis was not on board.

22:12.592 --> 22:14.333
- Then I'll do it myself.

22:17.901 --> 22:19.947
- One person said
they saw a guy

22:19.990 --> 22:22.036
in a red T-shirt
leaving the area.

22:22.079 --> 22:24.038
But there were
some inconsistencies

22:24.081 --> 22:25.082
with their account.

22:25.126 --> 22:26.388
- How about security footage?

22:26.432 --> 22:27.998
- Cameras
never came back online

22:28.042 --> 22:29.826
after we shifted over
to the backup generator.

22:29.870 --> 22:32.742
Remind me to jump down
IT's throats over that, please.

22:32.786 --> 22:34.309
- But what can we do now?

22:34.353 --> 22:36.180
We need to find out
who did this Felix.

22:36.224 --> 22:38.705
- If I had to hazard a guess,
I'd say whoever did this

22:38.748 --> 22:39.923
already exited the hospital.

22:39.967 --> 22:42.230
- At the moment,
our top priority

22:42.273 --> 22:45.581
needs to be ensuring the safety
of our patients and staff.

22:45.625 --> 22:48.802
Were you able to get in
any extra security personnel?

22:48.845 --> 22:50.325
- They're trickling in.

22:50.369 --> 22:52.283
I wanted to talk to you
about how best to deploy them.

22:52.327 --> 22:54.068
- Why don't we do
a walkthrough?

22:54.111 --> 22:57.506
- I'll fill you in
if I get any more information.

22:58.812 --> 23:01.641
- This is unacceptable.
- It is.

23:01.684 --> 23:04.339
But, look, we're gonna have
to accept the possibility

23:04.383 --> 23:06.210
that we might never
find out who did this.

23:06.254 --> 23:07.995
- Yeah, but Felix wouldn't
even have been in the entryway

23:08.038 --> 23:10.650
had I not insisted
on turfing him.

23:10.693 --> 23:13.435
- Look, you've been on
your feet for, what, 20 hours?

23:13.479 --> 23:15.481
What do you say let me
pass the brick off to Doris

23:15.524 --> 23:16.395
and you get some rest?

23:16.438 --> 23:17.918
- No, I'm gonna power through.

23:17.961 --> 23:20.094
- Doctor's orders, then.
- Daniel.

23:20.137 --> 23:22.488
- Margaret,
I'm not messing around here.

23:22.531 --> 23:25.447
I'm worried about you.
You need some sleep.

23:30.713 --> 23:32.236
Thank you.

23:44.553 --> 23:48.035
- Still can't tell
where the retained fragment is.

23:48.078 --> 23:49.558
2.0, rotate the image

23:49.602 --> 23:51.908
to feature
the right hepatic lobe.

23:53.910 --> 23:55.695
[2.0's alarm blaring]

23:55.738 --> 23:57.218
What's this?

23:57.261 --> 24:00.351
- Intentional motions
are at 74% efficiency

24:00.395 --> 24:01.962
compared
to your normal metrics.

24:02.005 --> 24:03.398
- What are you talking about?

24:03.442 --> 24:06.009
- You're too fatigued
to continue operating.

24:06.053 --> 24:07.837
- You're kidding, right?

24:07.881 --> 24:10.405
I've done hundreds of cases
far more exhausted than this.

24:10.449 --> 24:12.538
- It's recommended
you have another surgeon

24:12.581 --> 24:13.669
complete the operation.

24:13.713 --> 24:14.627
- There is no other surgeon.

24:14.670 --> 24:16.019
- I can take over.

24:16.063 --> 24:17.499
I just started my shift
a few of hours ago.

24:17.543 --> 24:18.892
I'm plenty rested.

24:18.935 --> 24:20.415
- You're not qualified.
You're a junior resident.

24:20.459 --> 24:22.896
I need you to override the
system and give me my image.

24:22.939 --> 24:24.288
- I can't.

24:24.332 --> 24:26.073
Mr. Dayton upgraded the code

24:26.116 --> 24:27.466
to make it impossible
to override.

24:27.509 --> 24:29.163
- Then get Jack up here
to do it.

24:29.206 --> 24:30.817
- You're wasting your breath.

24:30.860 --> 24:32.296
He doesn't want
anyone operating

24:32.340 --> 24:34.255
at a capacity
below the system's threshold.

24:34.298 --> 24:37.171
- This is ridiculous!
I-I feel fine!

24:37.214 --> 24:38.477
- I can do it.

24:40.957 --> 24:43.133
- Damn it.

24:43.177 --> 24:45.396
- Under your supervision,
of course.

24:49.618 --> 24:53.274
- 2.0, transfer primary surgeon
to Dr. Tanaka-Reed.

24:53.317 --> 24:55.363
Focus on the right lower lobe.

24:59.759 --> 25:01.630
Your show.

25:09.464 --> 25:11.901
- Katie's platelet count
dropped to 70,000.

25:11.945 --> 25:14.164
And her LFTs doubled.
Mag level was 7.

25:14.208 --> 25:16.079
- All right, we're gonna
need to induce labor.

25:16.123 --> 25:17.559
All right,
start her on oxytocin

25:17.603 --> 25:19.518
and restart the mag
at 1 gram an hour

25:19.561 --> 25:22.433
as long as she's doing better
and her reflexes are back.

25:22.477 --> 25:24.697
Oh, any ETA yet on Dr. Asher?

25:24.740 --> 25:26.612
- Just got off with OEMC.

25:26.655 --> 25:28.701
Seems she encountered a trauma
in the field.

25:28.744 --> 25:31.312
- What kind of trauma?
- He didn't have any details.

25:31.355 --> 25:32.922
Only that
the guard vehicle was disabled

25:32.966 --> 25:35.185
and they were having difficulty
finding transport.

25:35.229 --> 25:36.578
Thought
it might be another hour.

25:36.622 --> 25:38.885
- An hour? How is she
gonna survive out there

25:38.928 --> 25:41.365
for that long in this cold?

25:41.409 --> 25:43.324
All right, you know what?
I'm gonna pick her up myself.

25:43.367 --> 25:45.544
Where'd they say she was at?
- Canal and Lumber.

25:45.587 --> 25:47.284
- [screaming]

25:47.328 --> 25:49.504
- I'm sorry, Dr. Archer,
but Katie's delivering.

25:49.548 --> 25:53.029
- Right now? She's only
one centimeter dilated.

25:54.465 --> 25:55.815
I want you staying on this guy

25:55.858 --> 25:58.121
until Hannah gets back here
safe and sound.

25:58.165 --> 25:59.688
- All right.
You got it.

26:02.909 --> 26:06.913
- [panting]

26:06.956 --> 26:09.350
You think this is serious?

26:09.393 --> 26:11.657
- Why?
You got big weekend plans?

26:11.700 --> 26:13.615
- Actually, I do.

26:13.659 --> 26:17.227
My fiancÃ©e and I are supposed
to have cake tasting.

26:17.271 --> 26:18.838
I'm getting married next month.

26:18.881 --> 26:21.362
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

26:21.405 --> 26:23.190
- Well, don't worry.

26:23.233 --> 26:24.365
I'll make sure
you're fixed up in time

26:24.408 --> 26:27.237
to walk down that aisle.

26:28.543 --> 26:30.197
How you doing back there, Paul?

26:30.240 --> 26:31.720
- I don't know.

26:31.764 --> 26:33.679
It hurts pretty bad
when I breathe.

26:33.722 --> 26:37.030
- OK, let me
take a look at you.

26:37.073 --> 26:39.032
- [groaning]
- OK.

26:39.075 --> 26:41.034
Where's the pain?
- My side.

26:41.077 --> 26:43.819
- Your side?
Give me your flashlight.

26:50.173 --> 26:51.610
I'm gonna lift up your shirt.

26:51.653 --> 26:53.133
- Uh-huh.

26:53.176 --> 26:55.526
- OK, it looks
like the shrapnel

26:55.570 --> 26:56.919
might have penetrated
your chest well.

26:56.963 --> 26:58.617
Hold that for me.

26:58.660 --> 27:00.314
Do you have
any medical supplies?

27:00.357 --> 27:04.623
- Uh, no, but there's
a toolbox under your seat.

27:17.244 --> 27:19.725
- Hey, that--that bag,
hand it to me.

27:21.117 --> 27:23.598
OK, here.

27:23.642 --> 27:25.339
All right, Paul.

27:25.382 --> 27:27.689
You have a hole in your lung.

27:27.733 --> 27:29.082
I'm gonna
stabilize your breathing

27:29.125 --> 27:31.258
with an airtight patch.

27:31.301 --> 27:34.609
- That's your patch?
- Yes.

27:34.653 --> 27:36.655
Here we go.

27:36.698 --> 27:39.701
It's going to conform
to your body contour

27:39.745 --> 27:42.530
to create a better seal.

27:42.573 --> 27:44.314
All right.

27:44.358 --> 27:46.839
Now take a big inhale for me.
- [inhales deeply]

27:46.882 --> 27:48.318
- That better?
- Mm-hmm.

27:48.362 --> 27:50.277
- OK, good. Good.

27:50.320 --> 27:51.974
Good, good, good.

27:52.018 --> 27:54.411
There we go.

27:54.455 --> 27:56.239
The cavalry better
get here soon.

27:56.283 --> 27:57.545
- Yeah.

28:02.724 --> 28:03.116
.

28:03.159 --> 28:05.118
- This is all the blood
we have left.

28:06.946 --> 28:10.819
- Do you think
we should use it?

28:10.863 --> 28:13.866
- We don't have a choice.

28:13.909 --> 28:14.910
- All right.

28:14.954 --> 28:17.173
[machinery beeping rapidly]

28:17.217 --> 28:18.522
- A-line pressure's down.

28:18.566 --> 28:20.481
I don't think
we're gonna make it.

28:20.524 --> 28:22.657
- I only need
another 30 seconds.

28:22.701 --> 28:25.007
I'm almost there.

28:25.051 --> 28:27.053
All right.
Come on. Come on.

28:27.096 --> 28:30.447
Come on, Nina.

28:30.491 --> 28:31.797
I'm in.

28:31.840 --> 28:34.060
Launching the coil.

28:41.110 --> 28:42.721
[machinery beeping steadily]

28:42.764 --> 28:44.287
- Pressure's coming up.

28:46.594 --> 28:47.813
- All right.

28:47.856 --> 28:50.250
Let's get her up to the ICU.

28:52.513 --> 28:54.428
- Hi.
You've reached Ben Campbell.

28:54.471 --> 28:56.212
Leave a message
after the beep.

28:56.256 --> 28:59.041
[beep]
- I, um...

28:59.085 --> 29:02.175
[pounding on door]

29:07.833 --> 29:10.052
- [whimpering]

29:13.099 --> 29:14.578
- Are you all right?

29:14.622 --> 29:16.406
- [stammering]
It is so cold.

29:16.450 --> 29:19.279
- What happened?
- I slipped on the ice.

29:19.322 --> 29:21.803
- OK. Come on.
Let's get you inside.

29:21.847 --> 29:24.632
- [groaning in pain]

29:24.675 --> 29:26.808
- OK. Oh, my God.

29:26.852 --> 29:28.897
You're frozen.

29:28.941 --> 29:30.333
How long
were you out there for?

29:30.377 --> 29:32.466
- I don't know,
a couple of hours maybe.

29:32.509 --> 29:35.599
- OK, stay right there.
Stay right there.

29:40.691 --> 29:42.215
Let me take a look
at your ankle.

29:42.258 --> 29:43.782
- No!
- OK.

29:43.825 --> 29:45.305
I'm gonna go get a wheelchair,

29:45.348 --> 29:48.177
and we're gonna get your ankle
all fixed up, OK?

29:48.221 --> 29:50.136
OK, stay right here.

29:53.661 --> 29:56.577
- It feels like
there's a boulder on my chest.

29:56.620 --> 29:58.405
- OK.

29:58.448 --> 29:59.798
OK.

29:59.841 --> 30:03.018
All right, when you feel
that pressure building up,

30:03.062 --> 30:05.891
I want you to just
pull that flap back, OK?

30:05.934 --> 30:08.241
Try that for me.

30:08.284 --> 30:10.025
- [inhales deeply]

30:10.069 --> 30:11.592
- OK?
- Uh-huh.

30:11.635 --> 30:12.593
- Good.

30:16.118 --> 30:18.207
Hey. Is that EMS?

30:20.906 --> 30:24.257
[horn honking]

30:24.300 --> 30:26.389
- Looks like a civilian.

30:36.704 --> 30:39.489
- Sorry. I got here
as soon as I could.

30:39.533 --> 30:41.230
- Were you looking for us?

30:41.274 --> 30:42.841
- I was in the ED
with a friend of mine

30:42.884 --> 30:45.278
when I heard you needed a lift.

30:45.321 --> 30:49.195
I'm Sean.
Sean Archer.

30:49.238 --> 30:52.502
- Wait. Dean's son?
- That's right.

30:52.546 --> 30:55.723
- Huh. OK.

30:55.766 --> 30:59.466
Well, let's get these guys
in your truck.

30:59.509 --> 31:01.729
OK.

31:01.772 --> 31:05.298
- Katie, I know delivery didn't
go exactly as you'd planned,

31:05.341 --> 31:08.040
but, uh, your baby
looks healthy and strong.

31:08.083 --> 31:10.825
- Isn't he? Hmm?

31:10.869 --> 31:12.566
I was so worried.

31:12.609 --> 31:14.046
- Because
he was born prematurely,

31:14.089 --> 31:17.397
we're gonna have to have him
evaluated up in the NICU.

31:17.440 --> 31:18.746
It's a perfectly
normal protocol.

31:18.789 --> 31:22.097
Nothing to be concerned about.
- OK.

31:26.667 --> 31:28.408
[baby whimpering]

31:28.451 --> 31:30.889
And what about
the preeclampsia?

31:30.932 --> 31:33.848
- Well, in most cases,
it's resolved by giving birth.

31:33.892 --> 31:35.763
We'll keep an eye on that,
but in the meantime,

31:35.806 --> 31:37.199
I'll have you
transferred upstairs

31:37.243 --> 31:39.245
where you'll be
a lot more comfortable.

31:39.288 --> 31:40.768
- Thank you.
Thank you both.

31:40.811 --> 31:41.856
- Sure.

31:47.818 --> 31:50.299
- Can you believe it?
That was my first delivery.

31:50.343 --> 31:51.387
- I can, actually.

31:51.431 --> 31:52.606
- It's such a rush.
- Yeah.

31:52.649 --> 31:54.390
- Dr. Archer,
just spoke to OEMC.

31:54.434 --> 31:55.565
Hannah's on her way in.

31:55.609 --> 31:56.958
She should be
about 15 minutes out.

31:57.002 --> 31:59.352
- Thank you, Doris.
- And I also need a consult,

31:59.395 --> 32:00.962
Dr. Archer,
for treatment five.

32:01.006 --> 32:02.964
Patient's name is Heidi.
She fell and twisted her ankle

32:03.008 --> 32:05.097
trying to enter the hospital
over on Polk Street.

32:05.140 --> 32:06.446
Who do you have?

32:06.489 --> 32:07.969
- Dr. Hudgins here
would be happy to help.

32:08.013 --> 32:08.970
- Great.
- Absolutely.

32:09.014 --> 32:09.971
Let's get an X-ray.

32:10.015 --> 32:11.494
- That's Kathleen.

32:15.107 --> 32:16.456
- Hi.

32:16.499 --> 32:17.631
We're gonna get you
all patched up

32:17.674 --> 32:18.806
and back on your feet, Heidi.

32:18.849 --> 32:20.416
I promise.

32:20.460 --> 32:22.418
- Stop smiling so much.

32:22.462 --> 32:23.767
It's creeping me out.

32:27.684 --> 32:28.772
- X-ray.

32:32.820 --> 32:36.693
- OK, Heidi.
Unfortunately, it is broken.

32:36.737 --> 32:38.521
I don't think
you'll need surgery,

32:38.565 --> 32:42.308
but I'll inject a numbing agent
until ortho can weigh in.

32:42.351 --> 32:43.962
In the meantime,
let's get you out

32:44.005 --> 32:46.355
of this parka and under
some warm blankets, OK?

32:46.399 --> 32:48.314
- Oh, no! Stop!
Stop handling me!

32:48.357 --> 32:51.665
I-I can do it myself.
- OK.

32:51.708 --> 32:55.930
- Everybody, all night,
just hovering over me,

32:55.974 --> 32:58.063
just crowding my space.

32:58.106 --> 33:01.022
- Zach, can you, um,
come out here for a second?

33:01.066 --> 33:03.503
- Yeah, one second.
I just gotta draw this up.

33:03.546 --> 33:05.984
- Zach.
- Get away from me!

33:06.027 --> 33:06.985
Get away from me!
- Ow!

33:07.028 --> 33:08.421
- No! No!
Let go of me!

33:08.464 --> 33:09.857
- Can I get some help
over here?

33:09.900 --> 33:12.512
- Patient armed!

33:12.555 --> 33:14.296
- OK, sweetie.
- Pushing 5 of haldol.

33:14.340 --> 33:16.342
- Right here.
- No.

33:17.821 --> 33:19.736
- OK, sweetie.

33:19.780 --> 33:21.912
- Why won't anyone
leave me alone?

33:21.956 --> 33:25.133
- OK. OK.

33:25.177 --> 33:26.743
- [sighs]

33:34.490 --> 33:34.925
.

33:34.969 --> 33:37.928
- Daniel, do we know
why she stabbed Felix?

33:37.972 --> 33:39.669
- Because he was
talking too much

33:39.713 --> 33:41.367
and in her personal space.

33:41.410 --> 33:43.586
- What, she stabbed a guy
for being a close talker?

33:43.630 --> 33:45.762
- She's a seriously ill person.

33:45.806 --> 33:47.677
Diagnosed
with paranoid schizophrenia

33:47.721 --> 33:49.157
when she was a young woman.

33:49.201 --> 33:51.203
Last time she was here,
she was on thorazine,

33:51.246 --> 33:52.856
but that's, like,
ten years ago.

33:52.900 --> 33:54.075
I'm pretty sure
she has not had

33:54.119 --> 33:55.946
any kind
of consistent care since.

33:55.990 --> 33:58.601
Without her meds,
she's gonna be very volatile.

33:58.645 --> 34:00.603
- Well, hopefully, she'll get
the kind of help she needs

34:00.647 --> 34:01.996
moving forward.

34:02.040 --> 34:04.259
- In a prison-affiliated
psych ward?

34:04.303 --> 34:06.305
I wouldn't count on it.
- Hey, Jack.

34:06.348 --> 34:07.828
- Hmm?
- You got a minute?

34:07.871 --> 34:09.438
- Yeah, of course.
Excuse me.

34:12.833 --> 34:14.268
- Look, we need to--

34:14.313 --> 34:16.619
we need to talk about 2.0.
- Yeah, let's.

34:16.663 --> 34:19.187
Now, I'm told that it delivered
another tremendous success.

34:19.231 --> 34:20.884
- Success?
- Yeah.

34:20.928 --> 34:22.842
2.0 walked
an inexperienced surgeon

34:22.886 --> 34:24.279
through
a complicated procedure.

34:24.322 --> 34:25.976
Yeah,
I'd chalk that up as a win.

34:26.020 --> 34:27.848
- Sure, the patient
had a good outcome,

34:27.891 --> 34:30.981
but 2.0 glitched again,
Jack, big-time.

34:31.025 --> 34:32.373
- Well, come walk with me.

34:32.418 --> 34:33.636
Now, I'm listening,
though, sir.

34:33.679 --> 34:35.116
Keep talking.

34:35.159 --> 34:39.293
- Well, this new feature,
locking surgeons out

34:39.338 --> 34:43.646
because of some preprogrammed
metric of fitness,

34:43.690 --> 34:45.170
it's got to go.

34:45.213 --> 34:48.085
2.0 is a tool that was
designed to help surgeons,

34:48.129 --> 34:51.219
not keep them
from doing their job.

34:51.263 --> 34:52.438
I think it needs
to be disabled.

34:52.481 --> 34:54.353
- Listen, I gotta
disagree with you there.

34:54.396 --> 34:57.138
Now, look, I was told
that you had some difficulty

34:57.182 --> 35:00.359
with this thing earlier, yeah?

35:00.402 --> 35:03.449
- Uh, I couldn't
get it to work.

35:03.492 --> 35:05.190
Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

35:05.233 --> 35:08.323
Well, maintenance
took a look at it, and...

35:08.367 --> 35:12.632
yeah, it turns out
that it was working just fine.

35:16.114 --> 35:18.072
- Well, it wasn't working
when I tried it.

35:18.116 --> 35:20.770
Look, regardless,
it was an emergent situation.

35:20.814 --> 35:22.163
I was in a rush.
- Or could it be

35:22.207 --> 35:26.036
that maybe you were more
fatigued than you realized?

35:26.080 --> 35:27.342
Now look,
it's common for all of us,

35:27.386 --> 35:30.258
maybe even top surgeons,
to underestimate

35:30.302 --> 35:32.869
the effects of fatigue
on our reflexes and judgment.

35:32.913 --> 35:35.307
But isn't it great
to have a tool

35:35.350 --> 35:37.918
that can take all the guesswork
out of it?

35:43.489 --> 35:46.144
- OK, 40-year-old male involved
in a motor vehicle crash.

35:46.187 --> 35:48.189
Blunt trauma.
Possible head injury.

35:48.233 --> 35:50.191
Penetrative wound
to the left flank.

35:50.235 --> 35:51.323
Applied an occlusive dressing.
- All right.

35:51.366 --> 35:52.889
Take him to Baghdad.
- This way, guys.

35:52.933 --> 35:54.108
- This is Corporal Parker.

35:54.152 --> 35:55.631
28 years old.
National Guardsman.

35:55.675 --> 35:57.633
Isolated arterial hemorrhage
to the right leg.

35:57.677 --> 35:59.592
Applied a tourniquet
about 90 minutes ago.

35:59.635 --> 36:01.246
- Vascular surgeon
is waiting upstairs.

36:01.289 --> 36:03.161
OK.

36:03.204 --> 36:05.163
How you feeling?
- Good.

36:05.206 --> 36:07.121
Yeah, much better

36:07.165 --> 36:09.515
now that my patients
are stable and in hospital.

36:09.558 --> 36:11.734
- How did you get here?
I was worried about you.

36:11.778 --> 36:13.475
- Hey, Dad.

36:13.519 --> 36:15.216
- Sean.

36:15.260 --> 36:17.087
- I gotta move my truck.

36:17.131 --> 36:18.611
- All right.

36:22.136 --> 36:23.529
- I'm not sure
we would have made it

36:23.572 --> 36:26.314
if he didn't show up
when he did.

36:26.358 --> 36:28.098
Did you know
that he spent a year in Alaska

36:28.142 --> 36:30.753
driving a snowplow?

36:30.797 --> 36:33.408
- No, I didn't know.

36:35.236 --> 36:37.412
- You got a good kid there,
Dean.

36:45.855 --> 36:48.118
- Nina, can you hear me?

36:52.427 --> 36:54.821
Hi, Nina.
I'm Dr. Halstead.

36:54.864 --> 36:58.390
Can you hear me OK?

36:58.433 --> 36:59.869
Good.

36:59.913 --> 37:02.307
[knocks at door]

37:02.350 --> 37:04.352
Come on.
Come on in.

37:04.396 --> 37:06.963
- Auntie N,
you're all better now.

37:07.007 --> 37:08.965
You're gonna be OK.

37:09.009 --> 37:10.706
- I'll give you two a moment.

37:16.277 --> 37:18.627
- Which one of you two drongos
is responsible

37:18.671 --> 37:20.890
for blowing through
our entire blood supply?

37:20.934 --> 37:22.544
- I'm sorry.
Who are you?

37:22.588 --> 37:24.285
- The surgeon
who just performed

37:24.329 --> 37:27.245
a miracle cardiac bypass
with only two units of blood.

37:27.288 --> 37:28.507
- Justin, take it easy.

37:28.550 --> 37:30.160
Hey, we were all
strapped today.

37:30.204 --> 37:33.120
- You ate through 40 units
on a single trauma.

37:33.163 --> 37:36.732
Now, if my patient wakes up
with deficits because of this,

37:36.776 --> 37:38.343
that's on you.

37:43.696 --> 37:46.176
- Don't worry about him.
He's a prick.

37:46.220 --> 37:49.397
- No, he's right.
It was a bad call.

37:49.441 --> 37:52.182
- How can you say that?

37:52.226 --> 37:53.532
I mean,
look what we did for that kid.

37:53.575 --> 37:55.360
- That's my point.
I shouldn't have

37:55.403 --> 37:58.232
let my decision-making
be influenced by this kid

37:58.276 --> 38:00.756
or anyone else.

38:00.800 --> 38:03.324
I should have followed the data
like I always do.

38:03.368 --> 38:05.500
- Doesn't sound
very compassionate.

38:05.544 --> 38:08.503
I mean, remember, we're
treating real people here.

38:08.547 --> 38:10.331
- Sticking to the data,
remaining objective,

38:10.375 --> 38:12.638
that's how we save
the most lives.

38:12.681 --> 38:17.599
That's what makes us
objective and compassionate.

38:26.913 --> 38:29.611
- Hey.

38:29.655 --> 38:30.917
How's Paul doing?

38:30.960 --> 38:32.701
- Ah, he's making
a full recovery.

38:32.745 --> 38:34.964
- And Corporal Parker?

38:35.008 --> 38:36.836
- He's just out of surgery,
and he'll be up and around

38:36.879 --> 38:38.098
and walking in no time.

38:40.318 --> 38:43.712
Listen, uh, about earlier, I--

38:43.756 --> 38:45.105
- Oh, no.

38:46.889 --> 38:50.284
- I'm guessing the roads are
pretty ugly out there, huh?

38:50.328 --> 38:52.199
- Well, I've seen worse,

38:52.242 --> 38:54.897
but...yeah.

38:54.941 --> 38:58.553
- Well, in that case, I haven't
put my snow tires on yet,

38:58.597 --> 39:03.384
and I was wondering
if I can get a lift home.

39:10.957 --> 39:12.262

39:12.306 --> 39:14.395
Pretty impressive

39:22.403 --> 39:23.491
- And guess what?

39:23.535 --> 39:26.451
Felix is no longer critical.

39:26.494 --> 39:29.236
Crockett is confident
he's gonna be OK.

39:29.279 --> 39:31.194

Isn't it?

between Ben and I.

39:51.693 --> 39:54.479
you want to go get

- No.

39:56.132 --> 39:58.483
Actually, no.

39:58.526 --> 40:03.357
