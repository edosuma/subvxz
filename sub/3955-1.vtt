It's complicated.

We didn't steal it.

04:21.320 --> 04:24.722
There is a sword in Madam Lestrange's

04:24.880 --> 04:26.530

It was placed there this summer.

that this is the true sword of Gryffindor.

04:49.880 --> 04:54.488
There are more than a few curious things
in the vaults at Gringotts.

thought we'd been in there.

05:54.640 --> 05:56.529
She kept asking you
what else we'd taken.

05:56.680 --> 05:59.604
I bet you there's a Horcrux in there,
