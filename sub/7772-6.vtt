WEBVTT

00:11.267 --> 00:12.400
- Too much on the arms.

00:12.500 --> 00:14.067
are you doing?

00:14.167 --> 00:15.833
- I'm getting a suntan.

00:15.933 --> 00:17.733
Got my bikini on.

00:17.833 --> 00:19.400
I got the afternoon off.

00:19.500 --> 00:21.333
- I thought you had, like,
a date with a mom or something.

00:21.433 --> 00:23.700
- I have a date
that my mom set up.

00:23.800 --> 00:25.333
There's a big difference.

00:25.433 --> 00:27.333
Did I miss any?

00:27.433 --> 00:29.933
- Yeah, in your anus hole.

00:30.033 --> 00:31.433
Okay, Gene.

00:31.533 --> 00:34.000
You can't get cancer up there
from sitting in the sun.

00:37.933 --> 00:39.667
Sunburn in rectum.

00:39.767 --> 00:41.100
Possible?

00:41.200 --> 00:42.433
- Searching.

00:42.533 --> 00:44.800
"Requiem for a Dream."
- Rectum. Rectum.

00:44.900 --> 00:46.100
- Searching.

00:46.200 --> 00:48.333
"Requiem for a Dream."
- Not requiem. Rectum.

00:48.433 --> 00:49.367
Oh, I'm shouting.

00:51.667 --> 00:53.633
- Oh, nice,
you made me some popcorn.

00:53.733 --> 00:55.267
- Your dad's
been looking for you.

00:55.367 --> 00:57.333
- I found Gene!

00:57.433 --> 00:59.167
- I told him I'd do that.

00:59.267 --> 01:00.533
- Gene, come on!

01:00.633 --> 01:02.700
Tanzy's opening
her Mother's Day gifts!

01:02.800 --> 01:04.300
- Why does he do
this every year?

01:04.400 --> 01:06.333
- Maybe he feels bad
that you don't have a mom.

01:06.433 --> 01:07.667
Also, Tanzy loves gifts.

01:07.767 --> 01:10.667
- Well, this just in: I don't
give a . You know?

01:10.767 --> 01:13.167
- Oh, sorry.

01:13.267 --> 01:15.067
Oh, the production
value's so bad.

01:15.133 --> 01:16.733
Do you actually like this?

01:16.833 --> 01:19.500
I--I'm sorry, I just can't get
over the production value.

01:19.600 --> 01:21.467
- This one--this is from Gene.

01:21.567 --> 01:24.467
You can tell because it's
got Grumpy Bat on it.

01:24.567 --> 01:26.767
- Not from me.
I don't give a .

01:26.867 --> 01:29.067
- Ooh, leen-ger-ee!

01:29.100 --> 01:30.067
Thanks, Gene.

01:31.100 --> 01:32.433
- Got it.

01:32.533 --> 01:34.533
- Okay, wait. Say "You're
welcome" to your mom, Gene.

01:34.633 --> 01:36.067
- I will,
if I ever see her.

01:36.133 --> 01:37.633
Mom burn.

01:37.733 --> 01:39.167
Good one, Gene.

01:39.267 --> 01:42.100
- I might have to return
it 'cause it's for a fat person.

01:42.200 --> 01:43.433
- That's fine.

01:45.067 --> 01:48.067
- Hi, Gene.

01:48.100 --> 01:50.933
I'm your mom.

01:51.067 --> 01:52.733
- * We're too gangsta for TV

01:52.833 --> 01:54.667
* That's why
you don't see us *

01:54.767 --> 01:56.333
* But they still
wanna be us *

01:56.433 --> 01:58.567
Ha ha!

01:58.667 --> 02:01.533
Oh, my God.

02:01.633 --> 02:03.667
We can play
dirty hooker later.

02:03.767 --> 02:05.100
- Whoo! Yay.

02:05.200 --> 02:07.267
- Dad, there's a man
who says he's a mom?

02:07.367 --> 02:10.500
- Yeah.

02:10.600 --> 02:12.833
- Diane.

02:12.933 --> 02:14.300
- It's Dan now.
- Oh.

02:17.167 --> 02:19.767
- Well,
I'm--I'm Gene's mom.

02:19.867 --> 02:23.100
- Oh!
Well, happy Mother's Day!

02:23.200 --> 02:24.667
Would you like a Mom

02:24.767 --> 02:26.467
It's like a mimosa,
only it's champagne.

02:26.567 --> 02:28.067
- Tanzy, don't. Just--
- I'm sorry.

02:28.133 --> 02:30.167
Maybe I--I should've called
before I came over.

02:30.267 --> 02:32.067
- Oh, well--
- You can use our phone.

02:32.100 --> 02:34.400
- No. Tanzy, don't.
All right?

02:34.500 --> 02:38.400
You--you--I got to...

02:38.500 --> 02:40.833
just--I--just gonna--

02:40.933 --> 02:43.100
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

02:43.200 --> 02:46.933
This is so Diane.
- It's Dan.

02:47.067 --> 02:49.067
- Oh, okay, Dan.

02:49.167 --> 02:52.067
You are being
so Diane right now.

02:54.200 --> 02:56.767
- I was Kent's first wife,
Diane.

02:56.867 --> 03:00.167
- Yeah, and you left
without warning,

03:00.267 --> 03:02.933
and now you show up
the same way.

03:03.067 --> 03:04.367
How dare you?

03:08.567 --> 03:09.900
- No, she's not all right.

03:10.067 --> 03:11.933
I mean, she--she's trying
to process something.

03:12.067 --> 03:12.967
All right,
I tell you what.

03:13.067 --> 03:14.067
I think you should leave.

03:14.167 --> 03:15.633
Yep, I think you should go,

03:15.733 --> 03:19.733
because as you can see, we are
celebrating Mother's Day here.

03:19.833 --> 03:23.533
- Just so it's clear,
I'm not Gene's mother.

03:26.300 --> 03:29.700
- I hope it's not too late for
us to have a real relationship.

03:29.800 --> 03:32.867
I'm on Facebook now
and LinkedIn, if you'd like

03:32.967 --> 03:35.533
a more a professional,
somewhat useless connection.

03:38.100 --> 03:42.067
Well, good-bye.

03:49.133 --> 03:52.667
- Let's open my presents!
Come on, Gene.

03:54.067 --> 03:57.400
- Wait!

03:57.500 --> 03:59.533
What's up?

03:59.633 --> 04:03.067
- You told me to wait.

04:03.133 --> 04:06.633
- Oh, right.
Oh, now I remember.

04:06.733 --> 04:09.767
My dad was just joking about the
whole "you have to leave" stuff.

04:09.867 --> 04:13.433
He doesn't really mean it.
- Honey, your dad meant it.

04:13.533 --> 04:15.067
We don't exactly
have the best history.

04:15.133 --> 04:17.133
- He said you could
come back in and, like,

04:17.233 --> 04:20.333
hang out if you wanted to,
so you should.

04:20.433 --> 04:22.767
Or I don't know.

04:22.867 --> 04:25.067
Like, also
who cares or whatever.

04:25.133 --> 04:27.633
What did you say?

04:30.467 --> 04:32.233
- Start walking.

04:38.500 --> 04:42.700
* *

04:42.800 --> 04:45.467
- Sorry I'm late.

04:48.567 --> 04:50.700
Name's Pony.
I was at the strip club.

04:50.800 --> 04:54.233
I've never been to Canada,
and I have pierced nipples.

04:55.500 --> 04:57.767
- Oh, looks painful.

04:57.867 --> 04:59.533
- Yeah, this one's a little
infected.

04:59.633 --> 05:01.333
- I don't know why

05:01.433 --> 05:03.400
you think I need to know
either of those things.

05:03.500 --> 05:05.533
- Total honesty.
That's my policy.

05:05.633 --> 05:07.900
- I'm sorry. Are--
you're the dental hygienist?

05:08.067 --> 05:10.400
You're my mom's travel
agent's son?

05:10.500 --> 05:11.967
I don't know
why anyone has a travel agent,

05:12.067 --> 05:13.400
but that's who you are?

05:13.500 --> 05:15.333
- Guilty as charged.

05:15.433 --> 05:16.633
- That's my bag.
- Hey!

05:16.733 --> 05:18.500
- What are you do--

05:18.600 --> 05:20.833
- No.

05:20.933 --> 05:22.467
All right.

05:22.567 --> 05:25.067
Oh, three deodorants.

05:25.167 --> 05:28.500
That's weird.
- I get nervous, and I like...

05:28.600 --> 05:30.267
different smells
for different events.

05:30.367 --> 05:31.700
- Individually wrapped
condiments.

05:31.800 --> 05:33.067
That's some old lady
right there.

05:33.133 --> 05:35.333
- I like flavor.
- Ooh, compact.

05:35.433 --> 05:36.967
Thank you very much.
I'm gonna take that.

05:38.267 --> 05:40.400
- Hey. Jerk off lotion.

05:40.500 --> 05:42.533
- That's not jerk--
it's just normal lotion.

05:42.633 --> 05:45.067
I have--
- We're both adults here.

05:45.100 --> 05:46.400
A book.

05:46.500 --> 05:48.867
Who brings a book on a date?
- I don't know.

05:48.967 --> 05:51.567
Someone who's nervous
their date might be terrible.

05:51.667 --> 05:53.067
- This book's terrible.

05:53.167 --> 05:54.667
"

05:54.767 --> 05:56.067
- Yeah. Totally blows.

05:56.167 --> 05:57.167
Everybody dies at the end.

05:57.267 --> 05:58.567
- So sort of a spoiler,

05:58.667 --> 06:00.900
but I'm really impressed
you read "The Decameron."

06:01.067 --> 06:02.767
I can barely get through it.
All the--

06:02.867 --> 06:05.133
You seem nice.

06:05.233 --> 06:08.333
You got hair and the cans
and everything, decent face,

06:08.433 --> 06:10.367
but, listen,
I don't think it's gonna work.

06:10.467 --> 06:12.267
And besides,
my bros are having a bonfire

06:12.367 --> 06:14.733
down at their RV park,
so, uh...

06:14.833 --> 06:17.067
- So, uh...

06:17.167 --> 06:19.533
what are we...

06:19.633 --> 06:22.267
waiting for?

06:22.367 --> 06:26.567
*

06:28.067 --> 06:29.500
Jesus, your head is small.

06:29.600 --> 06:31.900
- Yes.
My mom drank in the womb.

06:32.067 --> 06:35.433
- Let's go.
- All right. Do you want--

06:35.533 --> 06:37.400
- Just leave it.

06:37.500 --> 06:39.833
- Yeah, take it.

06:39.933 --> 06:41.533
- This is my door.

06:41.633 --> 06:43.467
This is my carpet
and some of my clothes.

06:43.567 --> 06:44.800
- Oh.

06:44.900 --> 06:47.067
- That's, like,
a little dinosaur,

06:47.167 --> 06:48.733
and he's screaming out
something.

06:48.833 --> 06:49.933
I like to think he's like,

06:50.067 --> 06:52.267
"Language," 'cause
I use curse words a lot.

06:53.733 --> 06:55.900
- That's my blanket
I use it to block out the sun

06:56.067 --> 06:57.433
'cause the sun
sucks.

06:57.533 --> 07:00.500
These are my beanbag chairs.
I like to sit in them.

07:00.600 --> 07:01.733
- Hmm.

07:04.433 --> 07:07.200
Excuse me.

07:07.300 --> 07:08.367
Ooh.

07:08.467 --> 07:11.167
- Well, I didn't say
sit in my beanbag chair.

07:12.267 --> 07:13.567
- Yeah, sit on the floor. Yeah.

07:13.667 --> 07:15.300
I just don't know if there's
anything on your butt.

07:15.400 --> 07:16.400
Like to keep 'em clean.

07:16.500 --> 07:19.067
[yelling and screaming
on video game]

07:21.200 --> 07:23.067
- Yeah,
ice-skating and singing.

07:30.967 --> 07:32.900
Yeah, she's good.
I saw that TV movie about her.

07:33.067 --> 07:35.900
- Do you ever have that thing
happen where, like,

07:36.067 --> 07:38.833
you're going to the bathroom
and your legs fall asleep?

07:38.933 --> 07:40.100
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

07:40.200 --> 07:41.367
- Yeah.

07:41.467 --> 07:43.367
- Sometimes
I'm on the toilet so long

07:43.467 --> 07:45.067
that I pretend
I'm on a talk show.

07:45.167 --> 07:47.600
- That's cool.
How's it go?

07:47.700 --> 07:49.067
- Hello, I'm Dan, and I'm--

07:49.100 --> 07:50.867
here's a very interesting
young lady,

07:50.967 --> 07:53.067
very pretty lady with curly hair
standing next to me.

07:53.100 --> 07:54.067
Hello, Gene.

07:54.167 --> 07:56.500
- Hi, it's nice to be here.

07:56.600 --> 07:58.700
- What are you doing here today
in the bathroom?

07:58.800 --> 08:00.867
- I'm just going
to the bathroom, man.

08:00.967 --> 08:02.667
- Me too.
- Me too.

08:03.933 --> 08:05.967
Got any TP?

08:06.067 --> 08:09.433
- Yes, let me pass it to you.

08:09.533 --> 08:11.433
- That's too many--
I'll pause the game.

08:14.100 --> 08:16.067
- So, did you ever, um--

08:16.133 --> 08:18.167
did you ever
think about me all these years?

08:18.267 --> 08:19.567
Pass the gummy bears.

08:19.667 --> 08:20.867
- I thought about you
constantly.

08:20.967 --> 08:22.767
- Like, when you were
pooping and stuff?

08:22.867 --> 08:24.767
- Sometimes.
- Gross.

08:24.867 --> 08:27.733
- I have to say that I thought
that giving birth to a child

08:27.833 --> 08:29.567
would kick
in my maternal instincts.

08:31.167 --> 08:33.067
- Well, this is the first time
we've been talking in 20 years.

08:34.967 --> 08:36.133
- It took me a long time
to figure out

08:36.233 --> 08:38.333
that I could be
both a man and a mom.

08:38.433 --> 08:41.733
- Same. I'm, like, a really,
really, really good dancer,

08:41.833 --> 08:44.133
but I'm also super pretty.

08:44.233 --> 08:46.733
- You are very pretty, Gene.
- Whatever.

08:46.833 --> 08:49.233
- So glad you didn't get
my dead chicken eyes.

08:49.333 --> 08:52.567
- Oh, no, I got 'em.
- A little bit.

08:55.767 --> 08:57.433
- Eat, eat.

08:57.533 --> 09:00.800
You're skin and bones.
- Bon appétit.

09:03.667 --> 09:06.133
- Mm.

09:06.233 --> 09:08.067
- It's really good.

09:08.100 --> 09:09.067
- Oh.

09:11.533 --> 09:14.367
- That was so violent
and awesome.

09:18.967 --> 09:21.067
- Ugh.

09:21.167 --> 09:23.300
Looks like we're early.
Want to go around back?

09:23.400 --> 09:24.933
Give you a little cat bath,
little butt stuff?

09:27.500 --> 09:29.700
- You can't just say stuff
to people like that.

09:29.800 --> 09:31.800
- Well, you know,
I'm sorry, all right?

09:31.900 --> 09:33.267
But that's the kind
of guy I am.

09:33.367 --> 09:36.233
I give little to no thought
to the things that I do or say.

09:36.333 --> 09:39.500
I just--it's off the top
of my head, you know?

09:39.600 --> 09:41.800
South Dakota.
Cinnamon buns. Tawny Kitaen.

09:41.900 --> 09:43.867
Did not think
about those words at all.

09:43.967 --> 09:46.100
- Salmon.
"Mamma Mia." English.

09:46.200 --> 09:49.067
Lick.
Lick, lick, lick.

09:49.133 --> 09:52.400
Lick, lick my .
I didn't mean the last part.

09:52.500 --> 09:55.400
- Ooh, no, no, no.
That was my favorite part.

09:56.567 --> 09:58.667
- Nice foot kick, Ma.
- Thanks.

09:58.767 --> 10:00.067
- What else should you know
about me?

10:00.067 --> 10:03.067
Well, I have a fear
of spiders and Pierce Brosnan.

10:03.167 --> 10:05.067
- Same.
Oh, but I like spiders.

10:05.167 --> 10:06.767
What's your favorite TV show?

10:06.867 --> 10:09.367
- "Transparent"
and "Vanderpump Rules."

10:09.467 --> 10:11.200
- I love Vanderpump Rules.

10:11.300 --> 10:12.433
- Yeah.
- Whoa, hey.

10:12.533 --> 10:15.600
I asked you to leave.

10:15.700 --> 10:16.867
- Don't yell at him.

10:16.967 --> 10:18.900
- My name is Dan,
and you know that.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.433
Your name is Kent.
I hate that name.

10:20.533 --> 10:21.500
I always have.
- Ah.

10:21.600 --> 10:22.867
- And how the hell
did you not see

10:22.967 --> 10:24.733
that I have been here all day?
- Don't yell at him.

10:24.833 --> 10:26.433
- I have an extremely big house.

10:26.533 --> 10:27.700
Now answer my question.

10:27.800 --> 10:29.400
- Gene told me that you said
that I could come back.

10:29.500 --> 10:30.500
- I never said that.

10:31.800 --> 10:34.133
- Don't yell at my daughter.

10:34.233 --> 10:35.667
Gene, why did you say that?

10:35.767 --> 10:37.167
- It's my extremely big
house too!

10:37.267 --> 10:41.233
- Fine. What-what do you
want, Dan Joint custody?

10:41.333 --> 10:42.700
You remember
what happened with Teriyaki.

10:42.800 --> 10:44.233
- Don't you bring up Teriyaki.

10:44.333 --> 10:45.833
- Ah.

10:45.933 --> 10:50.033
- We shared a terrier mix,
and then I lost our custody.

10:50.133 --> 10:51.733
- Yeah.
- To a coyote.

10:51.833 --> 10:53.433
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah, that's correct.

10:53.533 --> 10:56.533
Dan, I want you to...

10:56.633 --> 10:58.633
- Leave.

10:58.733 --> 11:00.633
- I didn't know you had
that kind of aggression in you.

11:00.733 --> 11:03.233
- Well...
- You used to be so passive.

11:03.333 --> 11:05.733
- Well, I guess
we've both changed.

11:07.167 --> 11:08.833
- Good-bye, Gene.

11:08.933 --> 11:10.200
- Wait, no.

11:12.433 --> 11:14.833
Why do you make
all the moms go away?

11:18.167 --> 11:20.333
Why do you make them go away?

11:20.433 --> 11:22.667
- God, I hope she gets it once.
- Mm-hmm.

11:22.767 --> 11:25.133
- Ah!

11:25.233 --> 11:27.967
I hate my life!
It sucks!

11:28.067 --> 11:30.200
It's a sucky, sucky life,
and I'm gonna kill myself!

11:30.300 --> 11:31.833
- Shh!

11:31.933 --> 11:33.467
- I've got to do something
to make this better.

11:33.567 --> 11:36.500
I totally messed it up.

11:36.600 --> 11:38.367
I got to get my family
back together again.

11:38.467 --> 11:40.067
- Shh!
- Oh, sorry.

11:40.100 --> 11:41.367
[rapid Spanish speech
on television]

11:41.467 --> 11:43.333
They must really
hate each other.

11:43.433 --> 11:45.667
Whoa, now they're,
like, in love?

11:45.767 --> 11:47.667
What is the plot of this?

11:47.767 --> 11:50.967
Oh, my God.
I get it now.

11:51.067 --> 11:53.367
Love and hate
are one and the same.

11:53.467 --> 11:56.900
Where there is heat,
there is a flame.

12:01.167 --> 12:02.733
- What's happening
to your face?

12:02.833 --> 12:04.633
- A plan.

12:08.067 --> 12:10.233
- This is absolutely
fascinating.

12:10.333 --> 12:12.767
I don't know anything
about this subculture.

12:12.867 --> 12:14.667
Do you mind if I take notes?

12:14.767 --> 12:15.767
- Nah, go ahead.

12:15.867 --> 12:17.267
- Thank you. There we go.

12:17.367 --> 12:18.733
I got a little notebook

12:18.833 --> 12:22.533
just in case I saw something
I didn't know yet.

12:24.333 --> 12:27.533
- Oh, hell yeah, Joker.

12:27.633 --> 12:29.367
Oh, when.

12:29.467 --> 12:30.633
Save some for yourself.

12:30.733 --> 12:32.133
- Can't, I got
a long drive home.

12:32.233 --> 12:34.067
- Well, have you
ever made non

12:34.133 --> 12:35.300
- I heard it's a bitch.

12:35.400 --> 12:36.400
- Oh, it really isn't.

12:36.500 --> 12:37.700
Yeah, you brew it the same,

12:37.800 --> 12:40.433
but then you heat it to 175
for 20 minutes

12:40.533 --> 12:41.867
before you add your yeasts

12:41.967 --> 12:43.567
and your sugars.

12:43.667 --> 12:46.267
'Cause that's some--that's
real strange knowledge to have.

12:46.367 --> 12:49.133
- Oh, yes.
In high school, I threw a party,

12:49.233 --> 12:51.067
and I didn't want
anyone to get in trouble,

12:51.167 --> 12:52.700
so I homebrewed some NA.

12:52.800 --> 12:54.667
No one ended up coming, but--

12:58.467 --> 13:00.633
He means sexually, do we swing.

13:00.733 --> 13:03.267
- Joker here is very gentle
for his size.

13:03.367 --> 13:05.700
- Well, now I know how you got
your nickname, Joker.

13:05.800 --> 13:07.200
Do we swing?

13:07.300 --> 13:08.333
- I don't joke about swinging.

13:10.267 --> 13:11.500
- Okay.

13:14.167 --> 13:17.933
Guess I passed
the friend test, right?

13:18.067 --> 13:19.067
Are you okay?

13:19.167 --> 13:21.300
- Yeah. Just happy.

13:21.400 --> 13:24.067
- Oh. Oh, okay.
'Cause your mouth wasn't moving.

13:24.167 --> 13:26.633
Your breathing sort
of looked painful.

13:30.567 --> 13:32.800
- Ah. Again.

13:32.900 --> 13:34.367
- Let's see.

13:34.467 --> 13:35.533
It's my house,

13:35.633 --> 13:37.567
and this is my backyard.
Why are you here?

13:37.667 --> 13:40.067
- Because your daughter said she
wanted to meet me here privately

13:40.133 --> 13:42.867
and to be here at Steven,
which I assume means 7:00.

13:42.967 --> 13:45.200
- Well, I'm supposed
to be here at Steven, too.

13:46.500 --> 13:48.067
Ah.
- Oh.

13:48.133 --> 13:49.400
- Well, she really went to town

13:49.500 --> 13:51.333
with the Christmas light
thingies.

13:51.433 --> 13:53.167
Actually look kind of nice.

13:53.267 --> 13:55.967
- I think she hacked
the Spotify playlist

13:56.067 --> 13:57.700
of mine called "No Safe Word."

13:57.800 --> 14:02.767
- She also uncorked
a 1921 Château D'Prive Magnum,

14:02.867 --> 14:05.900
which I will try
not to let ruin the evening.

14:10.367 --> 14:13.767
Shall we?
- If you insist.

14:16.133 --> 14:18.133
- Mm. No.

14:18.233 --> 14:20.467
It isn't romantic enough.
Put more romance.

14:23.900 --> 14:24.967
That's good.

14:25.067 --> 14:26.333
Very good, Joy.

14:35.367 --> 14:37.767
- Not casting a spell.
Mind your business.

14:45.300 --> 14:46.900
- I'm just gonna say it.
- Mm-hmm.

14:47.067 --> 14:48.800
- I'm sorry that I didn't call
before I came over.

14:48.900 --> 14:50.067
- Okay, that's good.

14:50.167 --> 14:51.900
That--is that just
for now or for the time before

14:52.067 --> 14:53.567
or the time before that
or the time before that?

14:53.667 --> 14:56.100
- Okay.
It was for every time.

14:56.200 --> 14:57.500
- Okay.

14:57.600 --> 14:59.500
- I'd really like
to be part of Gene's life now.

14:59.600 --> 15:02.600
It was wrong of me not to
include you in the conversation.

15:02.700 --> 15:06.067
- Well,
I appreciate the apology.

15:11.333 --> 15:16.067
- Travel remains a passion
of mine, yeah.

15:16.133 --> 15:20.300
Do you still
enjoy listening to music?

15:20.400 --> 15:24.067
- I do. I like music.

15:24.100 --> 15:26.433
It's music.
- Mm-hmm.

15:26.533 --> 15:29.633
- Damn it. How do they spice
it up in telenovelas?

15:29.733 --> 15:31.500
- A third party.

15:31.600 --> 15:35.367
- Yeah.

15:40.633 --> 15:43.767
- If I say no, you're probably
gonna tell me anyway, so...

15:43.867 --> 15:45.067
- When our moms sets us up,

15:45.167 --> 15:48.733
I was sure you were just
some dental hygienist.

15:48.833 --> 15:51.767
- I am.
I am a dental hygienist.

15:51.867 --> 15:53.933
- Yeah, but you're so much more
than that, you know?

15:54.067 --> 15:58.833
You're spontaneous
and you're clever and real.

15:58.933 --> 16:00.533
I thought
this was some put-on,

16:00.633 --> 16:02.867
but it's--it's not,
and it's awesome.

16:05.433 --> 16:06.633
Sorry, I'm embarrassing you.

16:06.733 --> 16:08.867
I just--this is--this is
really great. That's all.

16:08.967 --> 16:12.667
*

16:12.767 --> 16:14.300
- I want you to have this.

16:16.933 --> 16:19.133
- Oh...ly cow.

16:19.233 --> 16:22.667
Does this mean we're,
like, going

16:22.767 --> 16:25.567
- No, it means I
gave you a jacket.

16:25.667 --> 16:26.900
- Okay.

16:29.700 --> 16:30.733
You want to see something cool?

16:30.833 --> 16:32.367
- Uh-huh.

16:35.867 --> 16:38.067
- Oh, wow.
- I'm not done!

16:42.333 --> 16:44.233
- "I have these shoes.

16:44.333 --> 16:46.667
#MothersDay."

16:48.233 --> 16:52.133
- Hey, Tanz-manian devil,
how's it going? Cool response.

16:52.233 --> 16:54.200
Look,
I just wanted to warn you--

16:54.300 --> 16:56.500
How do I put this eloquently?

16:56.600 --> 16:57.867
Your man is downstairs

16:57.967 --> 16:59.700
about to go downstairs
on another man.

16:59.800 --> 17:02.167
Dan's back?

17:02.267 --> 17:03.867
- I know, girlfriend.

17:03.967 --> 17:07.600
I feel you, but sometimes
people get back together.

17:07.700 --> 17:09.667
It's like everyone
always said to me, you know,

17:09.767 --> 17:11.233
"When you turn 25, Gene,

17:11.333 --> 17:13.333
you're gonna
start wanting a family."

17:13.433 --> 17:16.067
And guess what?
I do.

17:16.133 --> 17:20.633
I want my OG mom and my OG dad
to live that OG lifestyle.

17:20.733 --> 17:24.567
OG stands for "Only Gene."
- I will not let this happen.

17:24.667 --> 17:26.300
- Oh, no.

17:26.400 --> 17:28.067
I-I didn't want you
to get upset and go downstairs

17:28.100 --> 17:30.333
and add a little spice
to the scene downstairs, no.

17:31.467 --> 17:33.400
- I'm sorry, Gene,

17:33.500 --> 17:36.167
but I'm getting my man back.

17:36.267 --> 17:39.600
- Good!
I mean, or boo.

17:39.700 --> 17:41.067
Or do whatever.

17:46.467 --> 17:48.433
- I think he's gonna jump
over the fire.

17:48.533 --> 17:52.200
- I'm in love,
and her name's Millie.

17:52.300 --> 17:54.200
- Billie!
- You bet.

17:54.300 --> 17:56.700
- That's me. I'm Billie.
This is for me.

17:59.100 --> 18:01.767
Go!

18:04.167 --> 18:08.867
Pony, no!

18:08.967 --> 18:10.667
- Don't be upset.
- Come on.

18:10.767 --> 18:11.900
- You remember that--

18:12.067 --> 18:15.067
you remember that trip to Italy?
It was so amazing.

18:15.100 --> 18:17.333
- Amazing times.
- It was so amazing.

18:17.433 --> 18:19.133
- Do you remember the thing you
kept doing in Naples?

18:19.233 --> 18:20.367
You don't?

18:20.467 --> 18:21.433
- I don't remember anything
about Naples.

18:21.533 --> 18:22.600
- Come on.

18:22.700 --> 18:25.933
You kept calling
Naples "nipples" the whole time.

18:26.067 --> 18:28.433
You know, it really
wasn't all that funny at first,

18:28.533 --> 18:30.667
but you just kept doing it!

18:32.133 --> 18:34.133
- More, please.
, that's good.

18:37.167 --> 18:38.567
- It looks
like you don't need her.

18:38.667 --> 18:39.733
- You're right, Joy.

18:39.833 --> 18:41.933
I need to take matters
into my own hands.

18:42.067 --> 18:43.100
I didn't want to have
to do this,

18:43.200 --> 18:44.433
but it's not
like I wasn't prepared.

18:47.233 --> 18:49.167
Wish me luck.

18:49.267 --> 18:52.400
- You are all right,
Mr. and Mrs. Good.

18:52.500 --> 18:54.100
- You're all right.
- You are good.

18:54.200 --> 18:55.833
- Hey, Mom and Dad,
how 'bout a tune.

18:57.333 --> 18:59.167
* Let's get--

18:59.267 --> 19:03.333
Is this what you want?

19:03.433 --> 19:06.467
You want me to be a man?

19:06.567 --> 19:08.900
You want my husband, don't you?
- No.

19:09.067 --> 19:12.100
- Well back off!
'Cause he's mine, bitch!

19:12.200 --> 19:14.367
- Ow!
- Tanzy!

19:14.467 --> 19:17.367
You apologize this instant!
- No, it's okay.

19:17.467 --> 19:18.633
We're all grown-ups here.

19:18.733 --> 19:20.433
We can handle this like adults.
- All right.

19:25.433 --> 19:31.200
*

19:36.267 --> 19:37.533
- Stop! Stop it! Stop it!
- Get off of her!

19:37.633 --> 19:40.167
- That's it.
- No biting! No biting!

19:40.267 --> 19:41.733
- You're crazy!
And what

19:41.833 --> 19:44.400
- Take her inside!
Take her--take her inside.

19:44.500 --> 19:46.567
- Don't talk like that.
- I'm gonna kill you.

19:46.667 --> 19:48.167
- Oh, my God.

19:48.267 --> 19:50.633
- Okay.

19:50.733 --> 19:52.133
- I should probably go now.

19:52.233 --> 19:54.100
I have overstayed my welcome.

19:54.200 --> 19:55.900
And I tried
to head-butt a woman.

19:56.067 --> 19:57.300
So I've got to go home.

19:57.400 --> 19:58.967
- Wait!

19:59.067 --> 20:00.533
Oh, I forgot
why I said that.

20:00.633 --> 20:02.400
- I'm so sorry
you had to see me like that.

20:02.500 --> 20:04.533
- No, I'm pissed
I didn't, like, Vine it.

20:04.633 --> 20:08.500
That was, like,
"Vanderpump Rules" type .

20:08.600 --> 20:10.133
- Kent, would you
walk me to the car?

20:10.233 --> 20:12.567
I'd like to remain alive
at least until then.

20:12.667 --> 20:15.667
- I--I got you.
Come on, Dan. Come on.

20:15.767 --> 20:17.433
- Wait!

20:17.533 --> 20:19.400
I remembered.

20:19.500 --> 20:20.733
- Oh.

20:26.167 --> 20:27.300
- I love you, Mom.

20:27.400 --> 20:28.667
- I love you, too.

20:30.033 --> 20:33.167
- All right, come on. Come on.

20:33.267 --> 20:34.600
- Wait, are you guys
back together?

20:34.700 --> 20:36.567
both: No.

20:36.667 --> 20:37.667
Yeah, they're back together.

20:43.067 --> 20:47.300
How was your date?
- Um...

20:47.400 --> 20:49.633
He died.

20:49.733 --> 20:53.200
- Hmm.

20:56.467 --> 20:58.533
- My mom.

21:02.500 --> 21:04.367
Well, good night.
- Good night.

21:13.067 --> 21:14.333
- Let's open more presents!

21:14.433 --> 21:17.367
Presents for everyone!

21:17.467 --> 21:18.733
Come on, Gene.

21:18.833 --> 21:20.967
You can help me clean up
the wrapping paper,

21:21.067 --> 21:24.533
and you can list
all the presents, what I got,

21:24.633 --> 21:26.933
and what stores they're from
so I can return them. Come on.
