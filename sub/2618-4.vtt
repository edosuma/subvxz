WEBVTT

00:10.734 --> 00:13.401
This is the Miami-Dade
Police Department.

00:13.468 --> 00:14.967
Stop. You're surrounded.

00:15.034 --> 00:17.633
You are surrounded. Stop.

00:44.434 --> 00:46.234
Hey, come here.

00:46.301 --> 00:47.667
TRIPP:
Hey!

00:47.734 --> 00:48.800
Hey!

01:12.600 --> 01:14.533
Hey!

01:33.200 --> 01:34.500
Get your hands behind your back.

01:43.267 --> 01:44.701
You're under arrest.

01:44.768 --> 01:46.634
Check him for weapons.

02:12.451 --> 02:13.750
Get in there.

02:24.050 --> 02:25.517
I want first crack
at that kid.

02:27.984 --> 02:29.117
I'll be on the boat.

02:29.184 --> 02:31.517
All right.

02:41.618 --> 02:43.584
We have a...

02:43.651 --> 02:46.351
blood pool on the floor
right there.

02:46.417 --> 02:48.384
Be careful, please.

02:48.451 --> 02:50.850
Got more of the same
up top, port side.

02:50.917 --> 02:53.850
Looks like
that's where he abandoned ship.

02:53.917 --> 02:55.917
Look at this gunshot wound.

02:55.984 --> 02:57.783
It's a through-and-through.

02:57.850 --> 02:58.950
Yeah, it looks like
she bled out.

02:59.017 --> 03:00.084
Semi-auto?

03:00.150 --> 03:01.551
Yeah, a .32.

03:03.950 --> 03:05.917
All right.
Where are the expended casings?

03:05.984 --> 03:07.384
That's a good question.
Look at this high velocity

03:07.451 --> 03:09.750
spatter right here.

03:16.484 --> 03:18.417
And more interesting is this.

03:18.484 --> 03:21.551
DELKO:
That's a partial print.

03:21.618 --> 03:22.984
It's a little low on the wall,
isn't it?

03:23.050 --> 03:25.217
Whoever did this slipped
in the blood,

03:25.284 --> 03:28.084
and then attempted

03:28.150 --> 03:30.284
to break their fall
with that print.

03:34.050 --> 03:36.317
Well, the print's
on top of the spatter.

03:36.384 --> 03:38.150
Means the blood had time to dry.

03:38.217 --> 03:39.684
Gives us a time line.

03:39.750 --> 03:41.050
We are to believe,

03:41.117 --> 03:43.084
Eric,

03:43.150 --> 03:46.117
that this kid killed this woman,

03:46.184 --> 03:48.184
waited for the spattered blood
to dry,

03:48.251 --> 03:49.317
and then slipped and fell

03:49.384 --> 03:50.584
in the blood pool.

03:56.017 --> 03:58.451
It's Tripp.

03:58.517 --> 04:00.651
He says the kid just confessed.

04:02.451 --> 04:03.684
The kid confessed?

04:03.750 --> 04:04.917
That was quick.

04:04.984 --> 04:07.817
There's only 48 hours
till his arraignment.

04:07.883 --> 04:11.184
In this system,
that kid doesn't have 48 hours.

04:11.251 --> 04:14.850
* Yeah! *

04:31.217 --> 04:37.551
* We don't get fooled again *

04:37.551 --> 04:41.184
* Don't get fooled again *

05:05.050 --> 05:06.317
You got any warrants?

05:06.384 --> 05:08.417
No.

05:10.584 --> 05:11.818
Are you under the
care of a doctor?

05:11.884 --> 05:13.050
No.

05:13.117 --> 05:15.017
You got something to eat?

05:15.083 --> 05:16.050
You taking any medication?

05:16.117 --> 05:17.050
No!

05:17.117 --> 05:18.884
When do I get my phone call?

05:18.950 --> 05:20.150
Make all the phone calls
you want

05:20.217 --> 05:22.017
from pre-trial confinement.

05:22.083 --> 05:23.551
Sign your
booking slip.

05:23.617 --> 05:25.350
Step up to
that desk.

05:25.417 --> 05:27.451
Empty your
front pockets.

05:28.784 --> 05:30.217
Step up.

05:39.184 --> 05:40.651
Hey, that's my stuff.

05:40.717 --> 05:42.083
No, not anymore.

05:42.150 --> 05:43.284
It's contraband.

05:43.350 --> 05:45.250
Buy you a week
in the discipline module

05:45.317 --> 05:46.417
over at lockup.

05:46.484 --> 05:47.617
Well, can I keep that?

05:47.684 --> 05:48.884
It's got like 500 songs on it.

05:48.950 --> 05:50.918
No. Pluck your laces
off your shoes.

05:50.983 --> 05:52.284
What?

05:52.350 --> 05:54.184
Jail folks don't want you
hanging yourself.

05:56.617 --> 05:57.983
Are you stuck on stupid?

05:58.050 --> 05:59.317
Just do it.

06:08.150 --> 06:10.217
Let me have 'em.

06:11.617 --> 06:12.884
Put this on.

06:12.950 --> 06:14.150
The bus is waiting.

06:28.717 --> 06:30.617
State attorney
said he'll file.

06:30.684 --> 06:31.818
Case is a
walk-through.

06:31.884 --> 06:33.484
Frank, I'm not so sure.

06:33.551 --> 06:34.818
What do you mean?

06:34.884 --> 06:37.150
Something is wrong.

06:37.217 --> 06:39.250
Horatio, the kid
had the vic's blood

06:39.317 --> 06:40.584
all over his body.

06:40.651 --> 06:42.117
All right, we got
witnesses that place him

06:42.184 --> 06:43.184
at the scene.

06:43.250 --> 06:44.851
I get that.

06:44.918 --> 06:46.350
He confessed to me, Horatio.

06:46.417 --> 06:48.184
All right, and I have to
strike when the iron's hot.

06:48.250 --> 06:50.250
Is he the right guy, Frank?

06:51.284 --> 06:52.551
Well, I don't know.

06:52.617 --> 06:55.184
If you got somebody
better, serve him up.

07:31.950 --> 07:33.983
Surface on these is rough.

07:34.050 --> 07:36.384
We'll be lucky
if we get a print.

07:36.451 --> 07:38.684
There's lipstick, too.

07:38.751 --> 07:40.317
Was the vic
wearing any?

07:40.384 --> 07:42.217
No.

07:42.284 --> 07:44.017
But...

07:46.250 --> 07:49.050
But I do have blood
around her mouth.

07:49.117 --> 07:50.584
We surprised about that, Alexx?

07:50.651 --> 07:51.950
She was shot.

07:52.983 --> 07:54.250
No, no, no, no.

07:54.317 --> 07:55.884
Air bubbles.

07:55.950 --> 07:57.918
Means she was struggling
to breathe.

08:01.517 --> 08:03.684
So, death wasn't instantaneous.

08:03.751 --> 08:06.651
This girl was a fighter.

08:19.317 --> 08:21.617
Looky here, fish
on the block.

08:21.684 --> 08:23.584
PRISONER 2:
A punk for the bunk.

08:23.651 --> 08:26.417
PRISONER 3:
Hey check it out:
fresh meat.

08:29.184 --> 08:30.417
PRISONER 4:
Got some
new booty.

08:30.484 --> 08:32.250
PRISONER 5:
Yo!

08:32.317 --> 08:34.116
Put the fish right here.

08:34.183 --> 08:35.384
What'd he say?

08:35.451 --> 08:36.683
Sit!

08:38.150 --> 08:40.417
Back up!

08:40.484 --> 08:42.683
You've never been
in jail before, have you, boy?

08:46.717 --> 08:48.884
I believe
I asked you a question.

08:48.950 --> 08:51.784
No. No, I haven't.

08:51.851 --> 08:53.950
You look at me
when I talk to you.

09:03.983 --> 09:05.818
Did I say
you could look at me?

09:07.584 --> 09:08.717
Hey, check this kid out.

09:08.784 --> 09:09.884
He's eyeballin' me.

09:11.317 --> 09:13.350
Means it's tax time.

09:13.417 --> 09:15.284
<i>( laughter )
It's what?</i>

09:15.350 --> 09:17.950
You got to pay me
for letting you ride this bus.

09:18.017 --> 09:19.818
They-They took all my money.

09:19.884 --> 09:22.150
Oh, well, then I guess

09:22.217 --> 09:24.083
you'd better figure out
another way.

10:09.117 --> 10:11.451
Where's your shoes?

10:13.484 --> 10:16.017
I lost them.

10:16.083 --> 10:17.651
GUARD:
Right shoulder
to the wall.

10:17.717 --> 10:19.384
Follow the yellow line
and do not stop.

10:19.451 --> 10:21.350
<i>Let's go, move.
Okay, everybody, listen up.</i>

10:21.417 --> 10:24.017
Strip your clothes.

10:24.083 --> 10:27.150
Then I want a single file
stepping toward the showers.

10:27.217 --> 10:28.083
Move it!

10:28.150 --> 10:29.083
Everything.

10:29.150 --> 10:31.350
Let's go!

10:40.784 --> 10:44.617
Eat it or lose it.

11:03.251 --> 11:05.683
Sorry.

11:05.750 --> 11:06.850
Those are my shoes.

11:06.917 --> 11:08.184
If you want them back,

11:08.251 --> 11:09.717
you're going to have
to fight me for them.

11:12.151 --> 11:13.351
Relax, kid.

11:13.418 --> 11:14.717
I'm just busting on ya.

11:16.217 --> 11:17.850
What are you in for?

11:17.917 --> 11:18.884
Murder.

11:20.284 --> 11:22.017
You, Theo Huxtable, homicide?

11:22.084 --> 11:23.917
Yeah, that the charge.

11:23.984 --> 11:27.817
Well, all right then, big dog.

11:35.650 --> 11:38.683
You should've ate that.

11:40.617 --> 11:43.418
<i>Chavala pendeja.</i>

11:44.650 --> 11:46.850
<i>( speaks Spanish )</i>

12:01.284 --> 12:04.117
Hey, Jim, did you get anything
off the boat gun?

12:04.184 --> 12:06.917
It was definitely used to shoot
your vic, Patrice Boland.

12:06.984 --> 12:09.184
Prints?

12:09.251 --> 12:10.184
No.

12:10.251 --> 12:11.351
No, came up dry.

12:11.418 --> 12:12.550
Must have been wiped clean.

12:12.617 --> 12:15.051
Did you run the serial number?

12:22.617 --> 12:26.084
Automated Firearms.

12:27.117 --> 12:28.817
How long have you known the RO?

12:28.884 --> 12:31.351
Couple of hours.

12:33.518 --> 12:35.784
What?

12:35.850 --> 12:38.384
Look, I've done the work.

12:38.451 --> 12:41.117
But if you don't write
the report, I can't act on it.

12:41.184 --> 12:43.151
It's analyze

12:43.217 --> 12:44.418
and report.

12:52.950 --> 12:56.418
Registered owner's
a Michael Boland.

12:56.484 --> 12:57.884
That's the vic's husband.

12:57.950 --> 12:59.184
It's a small detail.

13:01.650 --> 13:05.184
Cal, I was gonna get to it.

13:05.251 --> 13:06.583
Cal.

13:06.650 --> 13:09.184
Excuse me. What is this?

13:09.251 --> 13:10.917
What's going on?

13:10.984 --> 13:13.017
Uh, we're checking
for gunshot residue.

13:14.051 --> 13:17.151
You see, I didn't shoot my wife.

13:17.217 --> 13:20.017
Mr. Boland, that's a photograph
of your gun.

13:20.084 --> 13:21.351
It was used to kill your wife.

13:21.418 --> 13:24.617
I keep it on board
for protection.

13:24.683 --> 13:26.850
I haven't been on my boat
for three months.

13:26.917 --> 13:28.850
That's an interesting
choice of words,

13:28.917 --> 13:30.084
considering the boat

13:30.151 --> 13:32.284
is not registered to you.

13:32.351 --> 13:34.217
It was my wife's boat.

13:34.284 --> 13:36.550
She was trying to sell it.

13:36.617 --> 13:38.351
We're reorganizing.

13:38.418 --> 13:39.717
You mean, getting divorced.

13:39.784 --> 13:41.184
Yes, we were.

13:41.251 --> 13:42.950
Traditionally,
if your wife dies,

13:43.017 --> 13:45.717
you inherit the proceeds
from the boat, don't you?

13:45.784 --> 13:47.217
I didn't want her money.

13:47.284 --> 13:49.051
Or her boat.

13:49.117 --> 13:51.051
Or her.

13:51.117 --> 13:52.550
I'd met someone else.

13:52.617 --> 13:54.184
That was the problem.

13:54.251 --> 13:55.950
Always another woman.

13:56.017 --> 13:58.217
Actually, no.

13:58.284 --> 14:01.317
I met him six months ago

14:01.384 --> 14:03.750
in the marina.

14:03.817 --> 14:05.550
I told Patrice.

14:05.617 --> 14:09.151
She filed the next day.

14:09.217 --> 14:10.817
Mr. Boland,
we're going to need

14:10.884 --> 14:12.917
to chronicle
your whereabouts, please.

14:12.984 --> 14:14.384
You're a day trader, aren't you?

14:14.451 --> 14:15.717
You work out of your house?

14:17.384 --> 14:18.683
Bal Harbour.

14:18.750 --> 14:21.017
I spent the entire morning
on the computer.

14:21.084 --> 14:23.217
Well, then you won't mind us
taking a look at it, will you?

14:23.284 --> 14:24.750
No, not at all.

14:24.817 --> 14:28.184
Well, M. Boland

14:28.251 --> 14:29.750
is the only one
that signed on today.

14:29.817 --> 14:31.518
Yeah, that's her husband.

14:31.583 --> 14:33.017
How do you know that?

14:33.084 --> 14:34.717
I'm a computer geek, Ryan.

14:34.784 --> 14:35.784
It's what I do.

14:35.850 --> 14:38.550
Jesus!

14:38.617 --> 14:41.217
This thing is on fire.

14:41.284 --> 14:42.950
It shouldn't be.

14:49.451 --> 14:51.750
Take a look.

14:54.451 --> 14:57.284
Exhaust fan's jammed with paper.

14:57.351 --> 15:00.484
That's why the hard drive's
so hot.

15:11.850 --> 15:14.251
"I can't spend another day
without you.

15:14.317 --> 15:16.550
"You're the only one for me.

15:16.617 --> 15:17.917
I don't want it to end."

15:17.984 --> 15:19.317
These are love letters.

15:21.650 --> 15:24.351
Found these letters stuffed
in the Boland's family computer.

15:24.418 --> 15:25.484
Anything jump at you?

15:25.550 --> 15:27.683
Phraseology and word
selection suggests

15:27.750 --> 15:29.051
the writer's masculine.

15:29.117 --> 15:30.484
"Hope we can grab some food."

15:30.550 --> 15:32.317
That's something
my brother would say.

15:32.384 --> 15:34.484
Okay. Now compare it to this:

15:34.550 --> 15:36.518
Tobey's confession letter.

15:48.317 --> 15:50.084
Several points
are similar.

15:50.151 --> 15:52.317
Height,

15:52.384 --> 15:54.351
pressure, slant.

15:54.418 --> 15:56.550
Look at the
lowercase Gs:

15:56.617 --> 15:57.950
the proportion, retrace--

15:58.017 --> 15:59.784
all consistent.

15:59.850 --> 16:02.518
Whoever wrote this confession

16:02.583 --> 16:05.217
wrote these love letters.

16:13.650 --> 16:17.351
Describe your relationship
with the Bolands, please.

16:17.418 --> 16:21.017
Patrice hired me
to detail her boat.

16:21.084 --> 16:23.950
I barely know her.

16:24.017 --> 16:26.184
What about the love letters
to Mrs. Boland?

16:26.251 --> 16:29.650
She hid them
in her computer, Tobey.

16:29.717 --> 16:33.251
You wrote them.

16:35.084 --> 16:36.850
Okay.

16:39.583 --> 16:44.184
She was there
every time I worked.

16:44.251 --> 16:46.051
Bathing suit, tanning oil.

16:46.117 --> 16:47.384
She said she was lonely.

16:47.451 --> 16:49.017
That her husband
ignored her.

16:51.950 --> 16:54.217
One thing led to another

16:54.284 --> 16:56.583
and pretty soon
it was two times a week.

16:58.284 --> 17:00.351
I did not kill Patty.

17:00.418 --> 17:03.351
Why did you write
the confession then?

17:03.418 --> 17:05.317
Because I had no choice.

17:05.384 --> 17:07.317
He kept coming down on me
over and over again

17:07.384 --> 17:08.518
telling me that I did it.

17:08.583 --> 17:09.916
I've got two witnesses
on the dock.

17:09.983 --> 17:11.884
She was dead
when I got there.

17:11.950 --> 17:13.884
They saw you leave her boat
covered in blood.

17:13.950 --> 17:15.518
I was running.
Not buying that.

17:15.583 --> 17:16.750
Why the hell were you running?

17:16.817 --> 17:18.317
What the hell were
you running from?

17:18.384 --> 17:20.084
I got two witnesses...

17:20.151 --> 17:21.717
Why the hell were you running?
...covered in blood.

17:21.784 --> 17:22.950
Did you steal something?
Leave her boat...

17:23.017 --> 17:24.817
I just wanted this to end.

17:26.750 --> 17:28.617
You've got to believe me.

17:28.683 --> 17:32.317
I want to, but Tobey,
you've got to help me.

17:51.184 --> 17:54.017
Wolfe, you expecting them
to change?

17:54.084 --> 17:56.318
There's two drinks, right?

17:56.384 --> 17:59.051
Yeah, maybe the vic
and the killer had a mojito

17:59.117 --> 18:00.483
before the gun went off.

18:00.550 --> 18:03.084
The problem is glasses.

18:03.151 --> 18:05.051
Cut pattern on them
won't offer a print.

18:05.117 --> 18:07.917
The glasses won't tell us who,

18:07.984 --> 18:10.217
but they could tell us where.

18:10.284 --> 18:12.051
Look at the table
around the glasses.

18:12.117 --> 18:14.217
DELKO:
Yeah, they spilled.

18:14.284 --> 18:15.550
So what?

18:15.617 --> 18:17.517
But they're uniform.

18:17.583 --> 18:19.217
The glasses spilled
the same way,

18:19.284 --> 18:21.251
to one side.

18:21.318 --> 18:23.318
What are the odds of that?

18:23.384 --> 18:26.084
Pretty good if you're banking
starboard in five-foot swells.

18:31.617 --> 18:34.418
The vic was shot
in the open water.

18:34.483 --> 18:37.384
Yeah, Horatio said
she was trying to sell her boat.

18:37.450 --> 18:39.450
Maybe someone
wanted a test drive.

19:08.318 --> 19:10.750
Hi, you've reached
Patrice Boland.

19:10.817 --> 19:12.951
If you're calling
regarding the sale of my boat,

19:13.017 --> 19:14.917
please leave
your contact information

19:14.984 --> 19:16.351
and I'll call you back.

19:16.418 --> 19:19.084
You were the last number
on Patrice Boland's cell phone.

19:19.151 --> 19:20.418
Can you explain that?

19:20.483 --> 19:21.550
Well, yeah.

19:21.617 --> 19:22.784
I'm in the market
for a boat.

19:22.850 --> 19:24.917
She was selling one.

19:24.984 --> 19:26.251
Did you meet with her?

19:26.318 --> 19:28.084
I didn't need to.

19:28.151 --> 19:30.251
She rattled off her price
over the phone

19:30.318 --> 19:31.617
and I pretty much knew

19:31.684 --> 19:33.884
I didn't have
a spare half-mil in my purse.

19:33.951 --> 19:35.418
So you were never on the boat?

19:35.517 --> 19:37.517
No. Never.

19:37.583 --> 19:39.817
Well, we found
traces of lipstick

19:39.884 --> 19:41.583
on a glass in the cabin.

19:41.650 --> 19:43.951
I was just wondering
if I could get a sample
of your lipstick

19:44.017 --> 19:46.517
so we can exclude you
from our investigation.

19:49.184 --> 19:51.284
Test away.

19:51.351 --> 19:52.450
It's Glamour Glow.

19:52.517 --> 19:54.017
A million girls have it.

19:54.084 --> 19:57.450
No, I was actually thinking more
along the lines of a swab.

19:57.517 --> 19:58.951
From your lips.

19:59.017 --> 20:01.117
My lips?

20:01.184 --> 20:02.450
Yeah. Right.

20:02.517 --> 20:03.850
Your DNA.

20:05.583 --> 20:07.217
Only one girl has it.

20:10.217 --> 20:12.483
Okay. Okay.

20:12.550 --> 20:14.318
My boyfriend and I met with her.

20:14.384 --> 20:16.017
On the boat?
Yeah.

20:16.084 --> 20:19.817
He wanted to take a ride
on her boat real bad.

20:19.884 --> 20:21.817
He's got big ideas.

20:21.884 --> 20:24.217
Convinced her to take us
out on the water.

20:27.550 --> 20:28.984
So, what do you think?

20:29.051 --> 20:29.951
I love it.

20:30.017 --> 20:30.850
I think
it looks beautiful.

20:30.917 --> 20:32.151
You like it?
Incredible.

20:32.217 --> 20:33.017
Definitely for us.

20:33.084 --> 20:34.117
Are your drinks okay?

20:34.184 --> 20:35.284
Yeah.
Oh, great. Thank you.

20:35.351 --> 20:37.051
Do you mind
if I use your bathroom?

20:37.117 --> 20:38.151
Oh, no. No.

20:38.217 --> 20:39.217
Go ahead.
All new fixtures.

20:42.418 --> 20:44.051
So, you think
you could get used to this?

20:48.617 --> 20:52.017
A few minutes went by
and Steve hadn't come up.

20:52.084 --> 20:53.984
So she went to check on him.

20:55.850 --> 20:57.750
I'll be right back.

21:00.684 --> 21:02.884
<i>And I hear this bang.</i>

21:06.750 --> 21:08.117
Oh, my God.

21:09.984 --> 21:11.984
What did you do?

21:14.151 --> 21:17.017
So, Steve... Steve was freaking.

21:17.084 --> 21:19.251
Said that he was going
to go away for murder.

21:19.318 --> 21:21.817
And that we should
just disappear.

21:21.884 --> 21:23.583
Sail off to
the Bahamas

21:23.650 --> 21:24.884
or Belize.

21:24.951 --> 21:28.418
Just dump the woman
and steal her boat.

21:28.483 --> 21:30.151
Just typical Steve stuff.

21:30.217 --> 21:33.117
So you were just
an innocent bystander?

21:33.184 --> 21:34.318
Yeah. I-I told him

21:34.384 --> 21:36.184
that the last thing
I was gonna do

21:36.251 --> 21:38.418
was get caught
on a dead woman's boat.

21:38.483 --> 21:40.917
Told him to go
back to the dock,

21:40.984 --> 21:41.951
let somebody discover her.

21:42.017 --> 21:43.251
Nobody had to know it was him.

21:49.384 --> 21:50.850
Why didn't you tell the police?

21:50.917 --> 21:54.384
He said if I told anybody
that he'd say I did it.

21:54.450 --> 21:56.483
It'd be my word against his.

21:56.550 --> 21:57.750
All right.

21:57.817 --> 22:01.617
I need you to write his name
and address down.

22:28.284 --> 22:30.650
Didn't you already arrest
someone for this shooting?

22:30.717 --> 22:32.684
I saw the chase
on the news.

22:32.750 --> 22:34.051
Someone's been arrested.

22:34.117 --> 22:35.617
Doesn't necessarily
mean they did it.

22:35.684 --> 22:38.084
I don't know
what Gina's been telling you,

22:38.151 --> 22:39.384
but I didn't do this.

22:39.450 --> 22:41.284
You were on the boat.

22:41.351 --> 22:43.817
Test me.

22:43.884 --> 22:46.483
Gina was the one
who shot that lady.

22:46.550 --> 22:47.684
Why would she do that?

22:47.750 --> 22:48.884
I don't know.

22:48.951 --> 22:51.051
Why would she buy a boat
she can't afford?

22:51.117 --> 22:52.550
She's crazy.

22:52.617 --> 22:54.351
I know you can test
for gunpowder.

22:54.418 --> 22:55.351
Go ahead.

22:55.418 --> 22:57.017
It's too late for that.

22:57.084 --> 22:58.817
But we will take
your prints.

23:01.384 --> 23:03.051
Have you got a problem
with that?

23:03.117 --> 23:05.550
No. Not at all.

23:24.117 --> 23:25.251
You see that?

23:28.117 --> 23:29.684
Yeah.

23:29.750 --> 23:32.917
Now check this guy out.

23:32.984 --> 23:34.217
Something's up.

23:34.284 --> 23:35.384
Yeah, this guy, too.

23:35.450 --> 23:36.418
I'm gonna notify
the Watch Commander.

23:36.483 --> 23:37.418
Call Main Control.

23:37.483 --> 23:39.684
Ask him where SRT is.

23:54.418 --> 23:56.351
Attention
Floor Prowlers and SRT:

23:56.418 --> 23:58.184
415 fight. 2500 module.
Baker row.

24:18.418 --> 24:21.184
Third Floor Prowler
requests immediate assistance.

24:21.251 --> 24:22.550
COs involved in a fight.

24:23.984 --> 24:26.117
Requesting bean bag guns, tasers

24:26.184 --> 24:28.850
and special response teams
at 2500.

24:37.117 --> 24:38.483
4-15. COs involved.

24:38.550 --> 24:40.984
Lock the gates down.
Rack the gates.

24:41.051 --> 24:43.917
Main Control,
2500 Baker and Charlie rows.

24:46.884 --> 24:48.051
Electrical failure.
Gates to manual.

24:48.117 --> 24:50.951
Module officers:
gates to manual.

24:51.017 --> 24:53.117
Baker row:
Lockdown. Lockdown.

24:57.184 --> 25:00.384
Baker row:
Lockdown. Lockdown.

25:00.450 --> 25:02.450
Repeat: Lockdown.

25:08.394 --> 25:11.394
You are in the wrong cell
in the wrong time

25:44.717 --> 25:46.083
Jailhouse shank.

25:46.150 --> 25:48.217
I found this on the kid.

25:48.284 --> 25:49.951
On him or on
the ground?

25:50.018 --> 25:53.250
'Round here, guilty
till proven innocent.

25:58.384 --> 26:00.150
Alexx.

26:03.117 --> 26:06.018
Stab injuries.

26:06.083 --> 26:07.450
Sharp force.

26:07.517 --> 26:10.417
Irregular pattern.

26:21.784 --> 26:24.517
I got something here.

26:24.584 --> 26:28.150
White substance.
I'm not sure what it is.

26:28.217 --> 26:29.951
Let's get that to Trace.

26:34.284 --> 26:35.250
Alexx.

26:35.317 --> 26:38.484
Have you noticed these shoes?

26:42.884 --> 26:43.984
Hmm.

26:44.050 --> 26:46.350
New kicks.

26:46.417 --> 26:49.050
And they are far too big
for our friend here.

26:49.117 --> 26:50.584
Aren't they?

26:50.651 --> 26:52.884
Got some dried blood.

26:52.951 --> 26:55.751
Hey, Horatio,
take a look at this.

26:58.417 --> 27:00.551
That's a shell casing
from a .32

27:00.617 --> 27:03.050
and none was recovered
from Patrice's boat.

27:05.250 --> 27:07.751
This guy's connected
to that boat?

27:07.817 --> 27:11.083
No. No, he's not.

27:12.517 --> 27:16.284
But those are the shoes
that Tripp booked Tobey in.

27:39.350 --> 27:41.183
So what's Gina saying now?

27:42.918 --> 27:45.050
She doesn't have
to say anything.

27:45.117 --> 27:46.951
Your print is on
this shell casing.

27:47.018 --> 27:48.183
The shell casing got stuck

27:48.250 --> 27:50.117
in the tread
of somebody's shoe.

27:50.183 --> 27:52.651
Now we've got you.

27:52.717 --> 27:54.784
You shot Patrice Boland.

27:54.851 --> 28:00.450
Look, my plan was to throw
her overboard at sea.

28:00.517 --> 28:02.450
Steal the boat.

28:02.517 --> 28:04.018
Then I saw the gun.

28:13.851 --> 28:15.317
Can I help you
with something?

28:29.884 --> 28:33.217
WOODS:
Through-and-through.

28:33.284 --> 28:36.018
Bullet missed
everything important.

28:39.083 --> 28:41.551
That means the gunshot wound
didn't kill her.

28:41.617 --> 28:42.884
So what did, Alexx?

28:42.951 --> 28:46.651
I noticed this when
her skin dried out.

28:46.717 --> 28:49.751
Skin's worn around her nose
and mouth from friction.

28:49.817 --> 28:52.517
She wasn't just struggling
for air, Horatio.

28:52.584 --> 28:53.918
No, she was smothered.

28:53.984 --> 28:55.717
That's what the
evidence says.

28:55.784 --> 28:57.684
I already told Delko.

28:57.751 --> 29:00.951
Then Patrice came to
and you smothered her?

29:01.018 --> 29:03.083
Smothered her?

29:03.150 --> 29:04.350
No.

29:04.417 --> 29:05.884
She was breathing
after she was shot.

29:05.951 --> 29:07.417
There was saliva on her mouth.

29:07.484 --> 29:10.117
You mean, I didn't kill her?

29:12.217 --> 29:14.851
You're telling me, you didn't
smother Patrice Boland?

29:14.918 --> 29:16.183
No. Never.

29:16.250 --> 29:17.584
See?

29:17.651 --> 29:20.417
It was the guy I saw
on television-- Boat Boy.

29:20.484 --> 29:22.684
I was right all along.

29:22.751 --> 29:24.751
Sit down!

29:24.817 --> 29:27.250
At the very least,
you're up for attempted murder.

29:30.751 --> 29:31.684
Hey.

29:31.751 --> 29:33.117
Hey.

29:33.183 --> 29:35.484
Hey, is that the shank
from the jail murder?

29:35.551 --> 29:37.484
Yeah, I found it
in Darrel's cell.

29:39.817 --> 29:41.717
Is that a turkey bone?

29:41.784 --> 29:44.250
Yep. I also found
a little dental floss.

29:44.317 --> 29:45.617
Prisoners are so resourceful.

29:45.684 --> 29:47.217
I know. I've seen
them make shanks

29:47.284 --> 29:48.884
out of all sorts of things:

29:48.951 --> 29:52.284
toothpaste tube,
toilet paper roll.

29:52.350 --> 29:53.584
How long do you
think it takes

29:53.651 --> 29:55.018
to sharpen
one of those things?

29:55.083 --> 29:56.350
Who knows?

29:56.417 --> 29:58.884
Inside there,
all they've got is time.

30:05.317 --> 30:07.751
Is Tobey's blood on that?

30:07.817 --> 30:10.317
Stabbers usually
cut themselves, too.

30:10.384 --> 30:13.450
I'll see if Valera
can narrow down things.

30:15.517 --> 30:18.584
The blood on the murder
weapon is the victim's.

30:18.651 --> 30:19.817
Yeah, I bet.

30:19.884 --> 30:21.484
He's got the stab wounds
to prove it.

30:21.551 --> 30:23.951
What about the other end?
I want to know who made it.

30:24.018 --> 30:26.784
I'll process the
handle and the floss.

30:26.851 --> 30:28.651
Check for DNA contributions.

30:28.717 --> 30:30.284
What about the kid's clothes?

30:30.350 --> 30:32.484
Tobey?

30:32.551 --> 30:34.284
I'm an analyst.
Process what I get.

30:34.350 --> 30:36.217
The clothes come in,
I'll take a look.

30:36.284 --> 30:37.317
The clothes haven't come in?

30:37.384 --> 30:38.450
No.

30:38.517 --> 30:40.551
This is what happens
with a confession.

30:40.617 --> 30:41.851
People get tunnel vision.

30:41.918 --> 30:43.951
Page me if you get
anything on the shank.

30:44.018 --> 30:47.117
<i>( phone chirps )
I'm gonna have a word
with Tripp.</i>

30:47.183 --> 30:49.751
Aaron, the white substance

30:49.817 --> 30:52.050
from the dead inmate's
mouth, please.

30:52.117 --> 30:54.817
Primary component is muslin,
an unbleached cotton yarn

30:54.884 --> 30:56.851
from a cloth or a sheet.

30:56.918 --> 30:59.484
There's also traces
of calcium sulfate and dextrose.

30:59.551 --> 31:02.884
...aka plaster, like you
would use to make a cast.

31:12.050 --> 31:13.284
That's low-rent.

31:13.350 --> 31:14.651
Most casts aren't
made this way anymore.

31:14.717 --> 31:16.951
They still are in jail.

31:20.951 --> 31:23.317
Stole my shoes.

31:23.384 --> 31:25.217
So you killed the man?

31:25.284 --> 31:26.684
Sent a message.

31:26.751 --> 31:28.751
Either that or get ripped off
every day till my trial.

31:28.817 --> 31:29.684
I don't believe you.

31:29.751 --> 31:31.117
Get in line.

31:31.183 --> 31:32.918
Did he threaten you?
Did he threaten your family?

31:32.984 --> 31:34.083
No, man.

31:34.150 --> 31:35.617
Why did you kill him?

31:39.317 --> 31:41.817
Tobey, this place
is changing you.

31:50.884 --> 31:53.217
I killed him
'cause he deserved it.

31:55.584 --> 31:58.317
There's no going back.

32:00.350 --> 32:03.018
Maybe there is, son.

32:03.083 --> 32:04.784
How?
You let me
worry about it.

32:06.551 --> 32:08.018
Yeah, Calleigh.

32:08.117 --> 32:09.450
Come over
to Tobey's cell.

32:09.517 --> 32:10.784
I need you to process it.

32:10.851 --> 32:12.651
Okay. What am I looking for?

32:12.717 --> 32:14.851
Any sign of provocation.

32:14.918 --> 32:16.183
Provocation?

32:16.250 --> 32:17.484
That would change everything.

32:17.551 --> 32:19.117
Okay. I'll take Tripp.

32:19.183 --> 32:20.417
Thank you.

32:22.751 --> 32:24.450
You hang in there.

32:29.617 --> 32:32.384
Let me know when you're
releasing the space.

32:32.450 --> 32:34.717
You'll be the first.

32:40.117 --> 32:41.817
What do you got?

32:41.884 --> 32:43.150
Dental floss.

32:43.217 --> 32:44.851
Shank was held together with it?

32:57.235 --> 32:59.892
I'm running the compares
with the ends.

33:00.083 --> 33:02.183
Horatio's not gonna like it.

33:03.217 --> 33:05.751
I knew that kid
was a bad apple

33:05.817 --> 33:07.384
the first time
I laid eyes on him.

33:07.450 --> 33:10.284
You know it's entirely possible
that he wasn't then, Frank.

33:11.617 --> 33:14.551
Come on. Let's go
process the other cell.

33:19.050 --> 33:21.117
File says your vic Darrel

33:21.183 --> 33:23.050
was assigned the bottom bunk.

33:24.918 --> 33:26.350
Here's something
on the bedding.

33:26.417 --> 33:28.684
Did he have a cellmate?

33:28.751 --> 33:29.951
Mm.

33:30.018 --> 33:31.984
No.

33:32.050 --> 33:35.317
Apparently Darrel
likes to fight.

33:36.350 --> 33:38.918
Looks like teeth marks.

33:38.984 --> 33:41.784
His medical record says
he was on Diazepam.

33:41.851 --> 33:43.117
Epileptic seizures.

33:43.183 --> 33:45.350
Well, that could explain this.

33:45.417 --> 33:48.417
I'm gonna take all this
back to the lab to be sure.

33:48.460 --> 33:51.360
It's more in the story

34:06.784 --> 34:08.817
Hey. These the kid's clothes?

34:08.884 --> 34:10.917
Tripp finally
dropped them off.

34:10.984 --> 34:13.650
I think Calleigh
lit a fire under him.

34:20.917 --> 34:22.217
Anything?

34:22.283 --> 34:25.083
So far nothing but
Patrice Boland's blood.

34:25.150 --> 34:26.583
What's this?
Handkerchief.

34:26.650 --> 34:28.317
Was stuffed in
one of his pockets.

34:29.516 --> 34:31.917
That's not good.
Patrice was smothered.

34:31.984 --> 34:35.016
Yeah, more blood from the vic.

34:35.083 --> 34:36.184
You able
to get epithelials?

34:36.250 --> 34:38.516
Sorry, no.

34:43.684 --> 34:45.583
Oh, wow.

34:45.650 --> 34:48.851
Yeah, tell me about it.

34:48.917 --> 34:50.382
So what is this?

34:50.449 --> 34:53.484
That is your wife's blood

34:53.550 --> 34:55.449
on your handkerchief,
Mr. Boland.

34:55.516 --> 34:58.051
<i>( sighs )
I have a lot of handkerchiefs.</i>

34:58.118 --> 34:59.917
I keep some on the boat.

34:59.984 --> 35:02.617
<i>( distant, echoing ):
I don't understand
what the problem is.</i>

35:02.684 --> 35:03.784
You checked my
alibi, right?

35:03.851 --> 35:05.317
See this?

35:16.283 --> 35:17.717
Horatio?

35:17.784 --> 35:18.884
Mr. Boland,

35:18.951 --> 35:22.383
I... I noticed
that drop of blood

35:22.450 --> 35:24.017
on your wristband.

35:27.717 --> 35:29.917
So? It's a drop of blood.

35:29.984 --> 35:32.084
I cut myself last week
fixing our lanai.

35:32.151 --> 35:34.017
It's not a blood droplet.

35:34.084 --> 35:37.283
It is caused by an air bubble.

35:44.684 --> 35:46.250
We-Well, what does that mean?

35:46.317 --> 35:49.084
It means that your wife was
alive when you found her,

35:49.151 --> 35:51.151
and she was struggling
to breathe.

35:53.684 --> 35:54.951
Michael...

36:06.350 --> 36:09.118
Now, we know you didn't
kill her for love.

36:09.184 --> 36:10.784
So it had to be the money.

36:13.017 --> 36:14.751
Michael, please...

36:22.751 --> 36:24.517
Look...

36:24.584 --> 36:29.550
I was eating my breakfast,
and I saw the ad.

36:29.617 --> 36:32.717
She was selling the boat
out from under me.

36:32.784 --> 36:34.184
And that was it.

36:41.484 --> 36:43.484
Hey.
Hey.

36:43.550 --> 36:45.450
Otto decided
to tag along.

36:45.517 --> 36:46.817
So what's going on?

36:46.884 --> 36:49.350
I want to find out exactly
what happened in that cell
between Darrel and Tobey

36:50.584 --> 36:51.684
Tripp told me you guys

36:51.751 --> 36:53.550
found the shank material
in Tobey's cell.

36:53.617 --> 36:56.650
And there was some sort
of disturbance on Darrel's bunk.

36:56.717 --> 36:58.550
Valera's working on it.

36:58.617 --> 37:00.817
Okay, but these guys fought,
didn't they?

37:00.884 --> 37:03.118
I mean, I'm all for
backing Horatio, but come on.

37:03.184 --> 37:04.184
The kid did it.

37:04.250 --> 37:05.317
Well, that's
beside the point.

37:05.383 --> 37:07.350
<i>Let's figure out
how he did it.</i>

37:13.184 --> 37:16.051
Okay. The COs
found Darrel stabbed

37:16.118 --> 37:17.417
in the back.

37:17.484 --> 37:20.650
Let's put our buddy
Otto to work.

37:23.184 --> 37:25.784
I've got two penetrating wounds

37:25.851 --> 37:27.084
below the left scapula.

37:27.151 --> 37:29.417
Angle's right to left
and downward.

37:40.118 --> 37:41.650
And the third penetrated

37:41.717 --> 37:43.151
the thoracic vertebrae, T4.

37:43.218 --> 37:46.283
Also downward,
right to left.

37:50.450 --> 37:52.550
Now, if Tobey attacked
from behind,

37:52.617 --> 37:57.151
these angles
show a right-handed tendency.

37:57.218 --> 37:58.817
Tobey had a cast
on his right hand.

37:58.884 --> 38:00.484
There's no way he could've
gripped the shank.

38:00.550 --> 38:04.984
Oh, okay, so the left hand.

38:07.218 --> 38:09.250
Uh...

38:09.317 --> 38:12.084
A left hand
didn't make these.

38:12.151 --> 38:14.151
What about the reverse?

38:19.984 --> 38:22.184
Darrel was the attacker.

38:22.250 --> 38:24.650
Darrel wasn't fighting upright.

38:24.717 --> 38:27.017
Get on your knees.
Come on. Do it.

38:32.751 --> 38:35.550
That's what Horatio
was talking about.

38:37.584 --> 38:39.517
I analyzed the saliva
from Darrel's cell.

38:39.584 --> 38:41.084
The weird thing is...

38:41.151 --> 38:42.151
it's not his.

38:42.218 --> 38:45.017
This is why Tobey wouldn't talk.

38:45.084 --> 38:49.517
It wasn't out of fear.
It was out of shame.

38:51.550 --> 38:54.417
I'll call Horatio.

39:00.383 --> 39:04.151
Tobey.

39:04.218 --> 39:06.317
Tobey, we just arrested
Michael Boland

39:06.383 --> 39:08.817
for the murder
of his wife, Patrice.

39:08.884 --> 39:12.184
Doesn't change that I killed
somebody here, does it?

39:14.517 --> 39:15.984
I'm staying.

39:18.017 --> 39:22.350
We now understand
that you acted in self-defense.

39:22.417 --> 39:25.884
No, it wasn't. I killed him.

39:29.383 --> 39:32.984
Tobey, when
we processed
Darrel's cell

39:33.051 --> 39:35.984
we found your saliva
on Darrel's bunk.

39:36.051 --> 39:38.350
And I'm guessing...

39:38.417 --> 39:40.250
I'm guessing
it wasn't the first time.

39:46.684 --> 39:49.517
The first day, he grabs my neck.

39:49.584 --> 39:51.684
Get in the bunk.

39:59.250 --> 40:01.917
Word gets around.

40:01.984 --> 40:04.784
I realized
it's going to be every day.

40:04.851 --> 40:07.118
For the rest of my life.

40:11.283 --> 40:13.118
And he comes at me again

40:13.184 --> 40:14.851
during the riot.

40:14.917 --> 40:18.250
And saying something
would've made it worse.

40:20.151 --> 40:23.118
I had to stop it myself.

40:35.817 --> 40:39.383
And that's it.

40:39.450 --> 40:41.584
No more.

40:44.984 --> 40:47.250
Do you really think
telling the truth

40:47.317 --> 40:49.317
is going to get me out of here?

40:49.383 --> 40:51.984
Here's what I think.

40:52.051 --> 40:55.417
Here's what I know.

40:55.484 --> 41:00.550
That at the end of the
day, the truth, Tobey...

41:00.617 --> 41:03.283
the truth is all we have.
