♪ ♪

00:07.959 --> 00:10.083
Happy anniversary.

00:10.166 --> 00:11.583
-Thank you, honey.

00:10.166 --> 00:11.583
-Thank you.

00:11.667 --> 00:13.500
Oh, thank you so much. (gasps)

00:13.583 --> 00:14.917
Oh, my God, this is so nice.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.709
-I cannot believe that you got us in here.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.709
-I know...

00:17.792 --> 00:19.917
Welcome to Boccone.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.500
-This is the chef's tasting menu.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.500
-Ooh.

00:22.583 --> 00:24.166
20 courses.

00:24.250 --> 00:27.125
She created it especially

00:24.250 --> 00:27.125
for this evening.

00:27.208 --> 00:30.458
And-and-and is that the price

00:27.208 --> 00:30.458
or the year you opened?

00:30.542 --> 00:34.375
This looks lovely.

00:30.542 --> 00:34.375
So, thank you.

00:34.458 --> 00:35.417
Enjoy.

00:35.500 --> 00:36.709
Okay, front or back door,

00:36.792 --> 00:37.875
what do you want to do?

00:37.959 --> 00:39.208
I get a choice?

00:39.291 --> 00:40.834
Happy anniversary indeed.

00:40.917 --> 00:42.125
No, Tim, come on.

00:42.208 --> 00:43.166
We've got to get out of here.

00:43.250 --> 00:44.333
This is too expensive.

00:44.417 --> 00:45.959
We're not gonna pay

00:44.417 --> 00:45.959
this much for a meal.

00:46.041 --> 00:47.500
Yes, this is absurd, but listen,

00:47.583 --> 00:49.917
this is a very special night,

00:50.000 --> 00:51.458
and I need to make up

00:50.000 --> 00:51.458
for 20 years

00:51.542 --> 00:53.458
of forgetting our

00:51.542 --> 00:53.458
anniversary, so we stay.

00:53.542 --> 00:56.458
That's very sweet and true.

00:56.542 --> 00:58.959
Okay, you know what?

00:56.542 --> 00:58.959
Yes. We're gonna stay.

00:59.041 --> 01:01.417
We're gonna stay and we'll

00:59.041 --> 01:01.417
just have to eat fast food

01:01.500 --> 01:02.625
for the rest of the year.

01:02.709 --> 01:04.667
Planning on doing that anyway.

01:07.083 --> 01:09.250
Enjoy your first dish.

01:09.333 --> 01:12.542
Foam of scampi

01:09.333 --> 01:12.542
with an uni crust.

01:12.625 --> 01:14.834
I recommend eating it

01:12.625 --> 01:14.834
from the inside out.

01:14.917 --> 01:17.125
Bon appétit.

01:17.208 --> 01:20.875
Oh, God, Tim,

01:17.208 --> 01:20.875
you constantly surprise me.

01:20.959 --> 01:23.375
And these last 20 years

01:20.959 --> 01:23.375
have just been...

01:23.458 --> 01:25.000
Done!

01:25.083 --> 01:26.583
Next!

01:28.583 --> 01:29.875
Oh, that's good.

01:29.959 --> 01:32.083
WAITRESS:

01:29.959 --> 01:32.083
Let it swish

01:32.166 --> 01:33.500
-around in your mouth.

01:32.166 --> 01:33.500
-Thank you.

01:33.583 --> 01:35.166
Let it just coat the inside

01:35.250 --> 01:37.083
of all your mucus membranes.

01:37.166 --> 01:38.625
Ah, <i>fantastique.</i>

01:38.709 --> 01:40.667
WAITRESS:

01:38.709 --> 01:40.667
You will taste all kinds of spices,

01:40.750 --> 01:42.083
like clove,

01:42.166 --> 01:44.083
cardamom and eye of newt.

01:44.166 --> 01:46.458
(gasps)

01:46.542 --> 01:48.291
Ooh. I don't think

01:46.542 --> 01:48.291
it's a straw, babe.

01:50.041 --> 01:51.458
Mmm.

01:57.208 --> 01:58.333
How could you

01:57.208 --> 01:58.333
finish that already?

01:58.417 --> 01:59.375
College.

01:59.458 --> 02:00.417
Don't breathe, don't think.

02:00.500 --> 02:01.458
Just drink.

02:01.542 --> 02:04.083
This is loin of bush bison.

02:04.166 --> 02:05.291
(shouts)

02:05.375 --> 02:06.959
I'm not eating your steak

02:05.375 --> 02:06.959
for you.

02:07.041 --> 02:08.625
I haven't even finished my own.

02:08.709 --> 02:10.500
It's your meat.

02:08.709 --> 02:10.500
You're my meat man.

02:11.834 --> 02:14.500
I'm starting to get full.

02:11.834 --> 02:14.500
I think I might

02:14.583 --> 02:16.250
have to go to the bathroom

02:14.583 --> 02:16.250
and take my underwear off

02:16.333 --> 02:17.500
just to make more room.

02:17.583 --> 02:19.291
I took mine off

02:17.583 --> 02:19.291
seven courses ago.

02:19.375 --> 02:21.834
I didn't start the evening

02:19.375 --> 02:21.834
with a pocket square.

02:21.917 --> 02:23.083
WAITRESS:

02:21.917 --> 02:23.083
And now we set sail

02:23.166 --> 02:24.333
through the South China Seas

02:24.417 --> 02:27.792
to experience the famous

02:27.875 --> 02:29.333
black pepper crab.

02:30.917 --> 02:32.166
It just keeps coming.

02:32.250 --> 02:34.291
We have to tell them to stop.

02:34.375 --> 02:36.417
No. Heather,

02:36.500 --> 02:39.500
this is the greatest

02:36.500 --> 02:39.500
meal we might ever eat.

02:39.583 --> 02:41.667
It's our children's

02:39.583 --> 02:41.667
college fund.

02:41.750 --> 02:43.417
And we are going to finish it

02:41.750 --> 02:43.417
together.

02:43.500 --> 02:45.166
I freakin' love you, Tim.

02:45.250 --> 02:46.417
Okay.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.583
We are not gonna

02:46.500 --> 02:48.583
have sex tonight.

02:48.667 --> 02:49.709
No.

02:54.333 --> 02:56.166
(groans)

02:56.250 --> 02:57.458
You're slowing down. Come on.

02:57.542 --> 02:58.834
We can't slow down.

02:57.542 --> 02:58.834
What's wrong?

02:58.917 --> 03:01.166
I might need you to burp me.

03:02.208 --> 03:03.667
You're seriously

03:02.208 --> 03:03.667
looking at me like that?

03:03.750 --> 03:06.166
I have changed you

03:03.750 --> 03:06.166
behind a shed at a barbecue.

03:06.250 --> 03:08.208
It's been a great 20 years,

03:06.250 --> 03:08.208
hasn't it?

03:08.291 --> 03:09.375
Yeah.

03:08.291 --> 03:09.375
All right, come on.

03:10.667 --> 03:11.959
Oh, God. Okay,

03:12.041 --> 03:13.375
just make it look

03:12.041 --> 03:13.375
like we're hugging.

03:13.458 --> 03:15.125
-Shh, shh, shh.

03:13.458 --> 03:15.125
-(burps)

03:15.208 --> 03:17.375
(diners groan)

03:17.458 --> 03:19.333
It's delicious, huh?

03:19.417 --> 03:21.000
(groans)

03:21.083 --> 03:23.458
Oh, it's gonna hit my stomach

03:21.083 --> 03:23.458
and ping-pong back up.

03:23.542 --> 03:25.250
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

03:23.542 --> 03:25.250
Come on. Look here.

03:25.333 --> 03:27.792
You got it. You got this.

03:25.333 --> 03:27.792
There you go.

03:27.875 --> 03:30.583
Oh, no more wine. No.

03:27.875 --> 03:30.583
I'm pregnant.

03:31.917 --> 03:33.125
Whole right side of my body

03:31.917 --> 03:33.125
is numb.

03:33.208 --> 03:34.542
I can't feel my right arm.

03:34.625 --> 03:35.875
-Can't hold my fork anymore.

03:34.625 --> 03:35.875
-(fork clatters)

03:35.959 --> 03:37.500
(groans)

03:39.458 --> 03:41.583
Have you been hiding courses

03:39.458 --> 03:41.583
under the table?

03:41.667 --> 03:43.542
-Just the even-numbered ones.

03:41.667 --> 03:43.542
-Heather,

03:43.625 --> 03:45.417
-I can't believe you lied to me.

03:43.625 --> 03:45.417
-Oh, you know what?

03:45.500 --> 03:47.583
Just shut up, Tim.

03:45.500 --> 03:47.583
I freakin' hate you.

03:47.667 --> 03:50.083
This meal is just like

03:47.667 --> 03:50.083
our marriage.

03:50.166 --> 03:51.166
You know, it just seems like

03:51.250 --> 03:53.125
it's going on and on,

03:53.208 --> 03:56.333
and it's not gonna end

03:53.208 --> 03:56.333
until one of us dies.

03:56.417 --> 03:58.834
Enjoying your meal?

03:58.917 --> 04:00.041
-It's amazing. It's amazing.

03:58.917 --> 04:00.041
-(clears throat)

04:00.125 --> 04:01.667
Wonderful. Is it still going on?

04:01.750 --> 04:02.709
This dessert

04:02.792 --> 04:04.083
is inspired

04:04.166 --> 04:05.125
by the men and women

04:05.208 --> 04:06.917
of the armed forces.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.291
With every bite,

04:08.375 --> 04:09.750
you're honoring them.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.625
No course left behind.

04:16.208 --> 04:17.500
Mmm.

04:17.583 --> 04:18.625
Mm-hmm.

04:19.625 --> 04:21.583
Oh, my God.

04:21.667 --> 04:24.166
It's like a clown car where

04:21.667 --> 04:24.166
you have to eat the clowns.

04:24.250 --> 04:25.458
I can't do it-- eat no more.

04:25.542 --> 04:26.709
You got to put that

04:25.542 --> 04:26.709
in your purse.

04:26.792 --> 04:27.750
Oh, honey, you have a hot towel.

04:27.834 --> 04:28.792
Just stick it in there.

04:28.875 --> 04:30.041
Hot towel?

04:30.125 --> 04:31.834
I thought that was a course.

04:31.917 --> 04:33.667
Did you eat your towel?

04:33.750 --> 04:35.333
(stammering)

04:33.750 --> 04:35.333
Everything's so blurry,

04:35.417 --> 04:37.208
and he put lemon juice on it.

04:37.291 --> 04:38.625
Oh, honey.

04:38.709 --> 04:41.458
I think part of me

04:38.709 --> 04:41.458
knew it was a towel.

04:41.542 --> 04:42.875
Hey, you know what?

04:43.875 --> 04:46.166
I am so lucky to have you.

04:46.250 --> 04:48.083
I love you, too, babe.

04:48.166 --> 04:49.291
Are you gonna throw up?

04:49.375 --> 04:51.250
-Mm-hmm.

04:49.375 --> 04:51.250
-Yeah.

04:53.917 --> 04:57.208
So, my friend Helen,

04:53.917 --> 04:57.208
the preschool director...

04:57.291 --> 04:59.291
The one who cuts

04:57.291 --> 04:59.291
holes in her shoes

04:59.375 --> 05:00.875
-to make room for her bunions.

04:59.375 --> 05:00.875
-Mm-hmm.

05:00.959 --> 05:02.417
Mm. Mm-hmm.

05:02.500 --> 05:04.333
She took Lark off the wait list.

05:04.417 --> 05:05.667
What?

05:05.750 --> 05:07.458
Lark's in, starting Monday.

05:07.542 --> 05:09.250
-That is amazing!

05:07.542 --> 05:09.250
-Oh! (laughs)

05:09.333 --> 05:11.000
How did you make that happen?

05:11.083 --> 05:12.583
Are you and Helen lovers?

05:12.667 --> 05:14.792
-No. She wishes.

05:12.667 --> 05:14.792
-Yeah. Mmm.

05:14.875 --> 05:16.792
Well, you know, all the kids

05:14.875 --> 05:16.792
have to be potty-trained,

05:16.875 --> 05:18.542
and this one little fellow,

05:18.625 --> 05:20.917
he was pooing

05:18.625 --> 05:20.917
in the turtle habitat

05:21.000 --> 05:23.792
-and blaming it on the turtles, and...

05:21.000 --> 05:23.792
-Oh.

05:23.875 --> 05:25.417
Yeah, it's so great

05:25.500 --> 05:27.291
that you've got Lark

05:25.500 --> 05:27.291
potty-trained.

05:27.375 --> 05:30.250
-Well, of course.

05:27.375 --> 05:30.250
-Mm-hmm.

05:30.333 --> 05:31.291
Lark is...

05:31.375 --> 05:32.500
-good to go.

05:31.375 --> 05:32.500
-Yep.

05:32.583 --> 05:33.667
Or not go.

05:33.750 --> 05:35.667
Like her dad.

05:35.750 --> 05:37.834
-I'm just so stressed.

05:35.750 --> 05:37.834
-I know.

05:37.917 --> 05:40.208
We've only got two days

05:37.917 --> 05:40.208
to potty-train Lark.

05:40.291 --> 05:42.500
No, it's about lying

05:40.291 --> 05:42.500
to my mom.

05:42.583 --> 05:44.500
We have a relationship

05:42.583 --> 05:44.500
built on trust.

05:44.583 --> 05:46.083
Yeah, but this didn't

05:44.583 --> 05:46.083
start out as a lie.

05:46.166 --> 05:47.208
You know?

05:46.166 --> 05:47.208
She just wanted us

05:47.291 --> 05:49.083
to do it when Lark

05:47.291 --> 05:49.083
clearly wasn't ready.

05:49.166 --> 05:51.208
And then we weren't ready,

05:49.166 --> 05:51.208
and then we took that trip,

05:51.291 --> 05:52.333
and then it was winter,

05:51.291 --> 05:52.333
and then spring

05:52.333 --> 05:54.166
and summer, and now, well,

05:54.250 --> 05:55.291
here we are.

05:55.375 --> 05:56.709
-But now's a good time. Right?

05:55.375 --> 05:56.709
-Yeah.

05:56.792 --> 05:57.959
Larkie, you want

05:56.792 --> 05:57.959
to use the potty?

05:58.041 --> 05:59.250
No!

06:00.250 --> 06:02.166
She outsmarted us again.

06:02.250 --> 06:03.667
JEN:

06:02.250 --> 06:03.667
Okay.

06:03.750 --> 06:05.208
So Larkie goes in the potty

06:05.291 --> 06:06.917
just like Mommy and Daddy.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.542
Here, look.

06:09.834 --> 06:12.041
TOY POTTY VOICE:

06:09.834 --> 06:12.041
<i>Good job! You're a big girl!</i>

06:12.125 --> 06:13.625
You want to go sit on it?

06:13.709 --> 06:16.083
No, I want to go on that one.

06:16.166 --> 06:17.583
JEN:

06:16.166 --> 06:17.583
All right.

06:17.667 --> 06:19.583
-Sure. Big girl, big potty.

06:17.667 --> 06:19.583
-Okay. Sure.

12:18.041 --> 12:20.250
Sorry. I got the balls

12:18.041 --> 12:20.250
only the pros use,

12:20.333 --> 12:22.125
-so they go a lot further.

12:20.333 --> 12:22.125
-Oh.

12:22.208 --> 12:23.291
Do you guys want

12:22.208 --> 12:23.291
anything to drink?

12:23.375 --> 12:25.792
No, I want to golf

12:23.375 --> 12:25.792
sober like an idiot.

12:25.875 --> 12:27.709
-(chuckles)

12:25.875 --> 12:27.709
-Two beers.

12:27.792 --> 12:29.333
-Okay.

12:27.792 --> 12:29.333
-I'll have a Perrier.

12:29.417 --> 12:30.375
What?

12:30.458 --> 12:33.208
I mean, uh, rosé.

12:33.291 --> 12:34.375
Okay.

12:34.458 --> 12:35.500
-Rosé.

12:34.458 --> 12:35.500
-Yeah.

12:35.583 --> 12:37.208
And two beers.

12:37.291 --> 12:38.792
That'll be 26 bucks.

12:38.875 --> 12:40.709
But we agreed--

12:38.875 --> 12:40.709
I get you the job,

12:40.792 --> 12:42.375
and you get me the free drinks.

12:42.458 --> 12:45.208
Oh, is that what all

12:42.458 --> 12:45.208
the winks were about?

12:45.291 --> 12:47.125
No, I just thought you

12:45.291 --> 12:47.125
were having a stroke.

12:47.208 --> 12:48.583
Well, this is ridiculous.

12:48.667 --> 12:50.458
I made you.

12:53.500 --> 12:55.667
Do you want me

12:53.500 --> 12:55.667
to watch you hit the ball?

12:55.750 --> 12:57.750
I'd rather you didn't.

12:59.667 --> 13:00.792
Oh! Geez.

13:00.875 --> 13:02.041
Oh.

13:02.125 --> 13:03.166
Hi.

13:03.250 --> 13:04.625
Hi.

13:04.709 --> 13:06.458
Look, on behalf

13:04.709 --> 13:06.458
of my entire gender,

13:06.542 --> 13:09.208
I want to apologize for the way

13:06.542 --> 13:09.208
that you were treated today.

13:09.291 --> 13:10.875
(chuckles)

13:09.291 --> 13:10.875
Are you kidding me?

13:10.959 --> 13:13.083
Oh, I had

13:10.959 --> 13:13.083
so much fun today.

13:13.166 --> 13:14.667
You know, I never knew

13:13.166 --> 13:14.667
that I looked like someone

13:14.750 --> 13:16.375
who could keep a secret.

13:16.458 --> 13:18.667
Wait, so you're fine

13:16.458 --> 13:18.667
with being completely exploited?

13:18.750 --> 13:20.000
What are you talking about?

13:20.083 --> 13:21.250
Well, I just thought

13:20.083 --> 13:21.250
you were above

13:21.333 --> 13:23.041
using your sexuality

13:21.333 --> 13:23.041
to get a tip.

13:23.125 --> 13:25.250
Wait, so that's what you think

13:23.125 --> 13:25.250
I was doing?

13:25.333 --> 13:27.500
-Yeah.

13:25.333 --> 13:27.500
-Oh, well, then, no, no,

13:25.333 --> 13:27.500
please, please, come on,

13:27.583 --> 13:30.333
tell me how you think

13:27.583 --> 13:30.333
a woman should behave.

13:30.417 --> 13:32.083
Well, first of all, I don't

13:30.417 --> 13:32.083
think she'd look to a man...

13:32.166 --> 13:34.375
That was not a real question.

13:35.792 --> 13:38.417
Saved double bogey.

13:35.792 --> 13:38.417
(chuckles)

13:38.500 --> 13:40.125
(grunts)

13:40.208 --> 13:42.834
Whew, look at

13:40.208 --> 13:42.834
that hot new cart girl.

13:42.917 --> 13:44.583
I don't understand

13:42.917 --> 13:44.583
how you guys get

13:44.667 --> 13:46.041
any golf done around here.

13:46.125 --> 13:47.709
(whistles)

13:47.792 --> 13:49.250
Hi, Dad!

13:49.333 --> 13:53.458
You realize you were just

13:49.333 --> 13:53.458
attracted to your own son?

13:53.542 --> 13:56.458
And he's not even that hot.

13:56.542 --> 13:59.333
Hey, Tyler,

13:56.542 --> 13:59.333
what are you doing here?

13:59.417 --> 14:03.000
And, more importantly, where do

13:59.417 --> 14:03.000
you stand on family discounts?

14:03.083 --> 14:05.750
I told the club president

14:03.083 --> 14:05.750
that only having female servers

14:05.834 --> 14:09.417
was a sexist policy that could

14:05.834 --> 14:09.417
revoke their tax exempt status.

14:09.500 --> 14:12.041
-Attaboy, huh? Stick it to the man.

14:09.500 --> 14:12.041
-(chuckles)

14:12.125 --> 14:15.000
The man who's against

14:12.125 --> 14:15.000
giving me free drinks.

14:15.083 --> 14:17.709
That'll be 26 bucks.

14:17.792 --> 14:19.709
Damn it, Tyler. Not you, too.

14:19.792 --> 14:22.291
I should've let your old man

14:19.792 --> 14:22.291
have his way with you.

14:22.375 --> 14:24.125
-What?

14:22.375 --> 14:24.125
-(chuckles): Wha... (sputters)

14:24.208 --> 14:25.709
And I'll pay for the drinks!

14:25.792 --> 14:28.458
So, decided to go

14:25.792 --> 14:28.458
behind Clementine's back

14:28.542 --> 14:29.917
and steal her job, huh?

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
Wouldn't it have been easier

14:31.083 --> 14:33.500
to just admit to her

14:31.083 --> 14:33.500
that you were jealous?

14:33.583 --> 14:35.041
Then she'd know that

14:33.583 --> 14:35.041
I made a huge mistake

14:35.125 --> 14:36.125
in wanting a divorce.

14:36.208 --> 14:37.458
Everyone knows you made

14:36.208 --> 14:37.458
a mistake.

14:37.542 --> 14:38.625
That doesn't mean

14:37.542 --> 14:38.625
she doesn't think

14:38.709 --> 14:39.959
it was a mistake, too.

14:40.041 --> 14:42.500
-You think?

14:40.041 --> 14:42.500
-So you need to go find that girl

14:42.583 --> 14:44.417
and you need to get her back

14:42.583 --> 14:44.417
in your life.

14:44.500 --> 14:46.750
All right?

14:44.500 --> 14:46.750
You go tell her how you feel.

14:46.834 --> 14:48.250
-Really?

14:46.834 --> 14:48.250
-Yes!

14:48.333 --> 14:49.667
She can't read minds.

14:49.750 --> 14:51.250
She's not a psychic.

14:51.333 --> 14:53.166
God, I hope she's not psychic.

14:53.250 --> 14:54.583
-All right. Thanks, Dad.

14:53.250 --> 14:54.583
-Go!

14:54.667 --> 14:55.959
-Run!

14:54.667 --> 14:55.959
-(chuckles)

14:58.542 --> 14:59.917
Look at him.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.959
Enjoying the show,

15:00.000 --> 15:02.959
you sick freak?

15:04.375 --> 15:06.250
Clem.

15:06.333 --> 15:10.166
Hey, can I talk

15:06.333 --> 15:10.166
to you for a second?

15:10.250 --> 15:12.458
-You gonna apologize?

15:10.250 --> 15:12.458
-Yes.

15:12.542 --> 15:14.792
Look, I'm sorry that I acted

15:12.542 --> 15:14.792
like such a jerk.

15:14.875 --> 15:16.792
You were right.

15:14.875 --> 15:16.792
I was just jealous

15:16.875 --> 15:18.792
of all the attention

15:16.875 --> 15:18.792
that you were getting.

15:18.875 --> 15:21.208
You know, Tyler,

15:18.875 --> 15:21.208
this divorce hasn't been

15:21.291 --> 15:23.333
exactly easy on me either.

15:23.417 --> 15:26.625
-Really? Because I was

15:23.417 --> 15:26.625
rethinking my decision...

15:23.417 --> 15:26.625
-MAN: Hey!

15:26.709 --> 15:28.709
You must be Tyler?

15:28.792 --> 15:30.834
Yeah, has Clementine

15:28.792 --> 15:30.834
been talking about me?

15:30.917 --> 15:32.375
No. She just said your name.

15:32.458 --> 15:35.667
Um, this is Ricardo. He works

15:32.458 --> 15:35.667
with me in the kids' club.

15:35.750 --> 15:36.709
Hey, we should probably

15:35.750 --> 15:36.709
get going

15:36.792 --> 15:38.208
if we want to catch

15:36.792 --> 15:38.208
the meteor shower.

15:38.291 --> 15:39.458
-Okay, yeah.

15:38.291 --> 15:39.458
-Yeah.

15:39.542 --> 15:40.709
I'll talk to you later, okay?

15:40.792 --> 15:42.208
Nice to meet you.

15:42.291 --> 15:43.625
Yeah.

15:43.709 --> 15:45.458
(both chuckling)

15:45.542 --> 15:49.458
Is that Clementine's

15:45.542 --> 15:49.458
new fella?

15:49.542 --> 15:51.834
She could do a lot worse.

15:51.917 --> 15:55.875
Maybe someday she will.

15:55.959 --> 15:59.250
Thanks, Pop-Pop.

16:06.375 --> 16:08.709
Ooh, Napa Chardonnay. Hmm.

16:08.792 --> 16:10.792
Hey, Uncle Matt.

16:10.875 --> 16:12.834
-What are you doing here?

16:10.875 --> 16:12.834
-Well, I'm definitely not taking food

16:12.917 --> 16:14.583
and sticking it in a grocery bag

16:12.917 --> 16:14.583
and then going home

16:14.667 --> 16:16.417
because I didn't think

16:14.667 --> 16:16.417
anyone was here.

16:16.500 --> 16:17.875
Cool.

16:17.959 --> 16:20.709
Why aren't you at the strawberry

16:17.959 --> 16:20.709
festival with your family?

16:20.792 --> 16:22.417
That's where they went?

16:20.792 --> 16:22.417
(chuckles)

16:22.500 --> 16:24.500
I just woke up

16:22.500 --> 16:24.500
and nobody was here.

16:24.583 --> 16:27.083
I'm sure your parents

16:24.583 --> 16:27.083
will feel terrible

16:27.166 --> 16:29.000
when they realize

16:27.166 --> 16:29.000
they left you out.

16:29.083 --> 16:32.000
No, they won't. Dad'll come in

16:29.083 --> 16:32.000
and he'll be like,

16:32.083 --> 16:34.667
"Oh, how'd you beat us in

16:32.083 --> 16:34.667
from the car?"

16:34.750 --> 16:36.875
Yeah, I know what it's

16:34.750 --> 16:36.875
like being a middle child.

16:36.959 --> 16:38.083
I mean, look around this place.

16:38.166 --> 16:40.000
There's no pictures

16:38.166 --> 16:40.000
of me anywhere.

16:40.083 --> 16:42.166
And I'm the good-looking one.

16:40.083 --> 16:42.166
You know, my whole life,

16:42.250 --> 16:43.917
it was all about Heather.

16:42.250 --> 16:43.917
And then, suddenly,

16:44.000 --> 16:46.166
Greg was born with a tail, and

16:44.000 --> 16:46.166
it's like I don't even exist.

16:46.250 --> 16:47.875
No one told me he had a tail.

16:47.959 --> 16:49.792
(sighs) Nobody tells me

16:47.959 --> 16:49.792
anything.

16:49.875 --> 16:52.125
I'm like the middle piece

16:49.875 --> 16:52.125
of bread in a club sandwich--

16:52.208 --> 16:54.125
everyone just wishes

16:52.208 --> 16:54.125
you were more bacon.

16:54.208 --> 16:55.875
You know what?

16:55.959 --> 16:57.166
All that changes today.

16:57.250 --> 16:58.625
Today is Middle Child Day.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.750
What is something that you

16:59.000 --> 17:00.750
have always wanted to do

17:00.917 --> 17:01.959
but you haven't been

17:00.917 --> 17:01.959
able to do because

17:01.959 --> 17:03.208
you're the forgotten one?

17:03.291 --> 17:05.083
I don't care. You choose.

17:05.166 --> 17:07.333
No. Stop accommodating

17:05.166 --> 17:07.333
everyone like a middle.

17:07.417 --> 17:08.375
Be the bacon.

17:08.458 --> 17:09.458
Uh... (chuckles)

17:09.542 --> 17:11.500
I've always wanted to do

17:09.542 --> 17:11.500
trapeze.

17:11.583 --> 17:12.542
Anything else?

17:12.625 --> 17:13.625
Get my tongue pierced?

17:13.709 --> 17:15.125
-Trapeze it is.

17:13.709 --> 17:15.125
-(laughs)

17:17.250 --> 17:20.208
You know, there is a piercing

17:17.250 --> 17:20.208
place around the corner.

17:20.291 --> 17:21.959
It's only got one star

17:20.291 --> 17:21.959
on Yelp, but that's fine.

17:22.041 --> 17:23.542
What if I love this?

17:23.625 --> 17:26.291
What if I'm good at this?

17:23.625 --> 17:26.291
What if it becomes a career?

17:26.375 --> 17:27.792
What if I give you all

17:26.375 --> 17:27.792
the money in my wallet

17:27.792 --> 17:29.041
and we just call this a day?

17:29.125 --> 17:30.458
I thought

17:29.125 --> 17:30.458
you didn't have any money

17:30.542 --> 17:31.583
and I had to pay for this.

17:31.667 --> 17:32.625
That is correct.

17:32.709 --> 17:34.375
Are you scared of heights?

17:34.458 --> 17:36.250
I thought

17:34.458 --> 17:36.250
you were just afraid of spiders.

17:36.917 --> 17:38.333
Oh! (laughs nervously)

17:38.417 --> 17:39.500
Oh, look at that.

17:39.583 --> 17:41.083
Yeah, no, I'm scared of heights.

17:41.166 --> 17:42.583
Why? Do you think that

17:41.166 --> 17:42.583
there's spiders up there, too?

17:42.667 --> 17:43.750
Because if there are,

17:42.667 --> 17:43.750
then, you know what,

17:43.834 --> 17:45.125
to hell with it--

17:43.834 --> 17:45.125
I'm just gonna go home.

17:45.208 --> 17:47.542
Uncle Matt,

17:45.208 --> 17:47.542
the thing about being a middle

17:47.625 --> 17:50.875
is that people never believe

17:47.625 --> 17:50.875
in us or they forget about us.

17:50.959 --> 17:53.583
-But you know what?

17:50.959 --> 17:53.583
-What?

17:53.667 --> 17:56.000
I don't know. I've never been

17:53.667 --> 17:56.000
able to make a speech this long

17:56.083 --> 17:57.750
without someone interrupting me.

17:59.291 --> 18:01.250
You're right.

18:01.333 --> 18:03.291
Middle power.

18:07.625 --> 18:09.625
View is beautiful.

18:09.709 --> 18:11.125
(panting)

18:12.834 --> 18:15.166
I really should've told Colleen

18:12.834 --> 18:15.166
I loved her this morning.

18:15.250 --> 18:17.166
Can't believe my last words

18:15.250 --> 18:17.166
to her are gonna be,

18:17.250 --> 18:18.667
"Hey, can you hand me

18:17.250 --> 18:18.667
that spray?

18:18.750 --> 18:20.959
I just wrecked this bathroom."

18:21.041 --> 18:22.333
Hey! Hurry up!

18:22.417 --> 18:24.083
Other people want to go, too!

18:24.166 --> 18:25.792
We'll go when we're ready!

18:25.875 --> 18:27.291
You want to come down here

18:25.875 --> 18:27.291
and say that?

18:27.375 --> 18:28.625
Yes, I really do!

18:28.709 --> 18:30.917
Okay. We're gonna do this.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.458
All right, just take this bar.

18:33.542 --> 18:35.458
There it is.

18:33.542 --> 18:35.458
(chuckles): Hey.

18:35.542 --> 18:38.041
All right, now. (sighs)

18:38.125 --> 18:40.291
Now... now,

18:38.125 --> 18:40.291
just don't look down.

18:40.375 --> 18:41.792
Don't look... What'd I just say?

18:41.875 --> 18:43.166
Matt, don't look down. Don't...

18:43.875 --> 18:45.834
Uncle Matt?

18:45.917 --> 18:47.250
Are you okay?!

18:50.667 --> 18:53.291
Don't say anything

18:50.667 --> 18:53.291
if you're okay.

19:00.083 --> 19:02.333
All right, Sammy, here you go.

19:03.500 --> 19:04.750
Spotlight's all yours.

19:04.834 --> 19:06.792
SAMANTHA:

19:04.834 --> 19:06.792
Okay! Here goes.

19:06.875 --> 19:08.875
Ready, set, go.

19:08.959 --> 19:10.458
(squeals, laughs)

19:10.542 --> 19:12.083
Hey, man, check it out.

19:10.542 --> 19:12.083
That's my niece. I mean,

19:12.166 --> 19:14.208
she's a little bit quiet,

19:12.166 --> 19:14.208
but if you keep your eye on her,

19:14.291 --> 19:16.375
you see what makes her

19:14.291 --> 19:16.375
so special.

19:17.917 --> 19:19.959
Oh! Oh, no! Okay. All right,

19:17.917 --> 19:19.959
all right, all right.

19:20.041 --> 19:21.750
-That is special.

19:20.041 --> 19:21.750
-Okay, well, look away.

19:21.834 --> 19:22.792
That's my niece.

19:22.875 --> 19:24.375
Ooh!

19:24.458 --> 19:26.625
Look at you! You're

19:24.458 --> 19:26.625
amazing! With the thing

19:26.709 --> 19:28.041
with the legs! You

19:26.709 --> 19:28.041
went upside down!

19:28.125 --> 19:31.542
-It was incredible! (laughs)

19:28.125 --> 19:31.542
-I know! Thank you.

19:31.625 --> 19:33.417
Would you like a souvenir photo

19:31.625 --> 19:33.417
of you on the trapeze?

19:33.500 --> 19:35.000
-Yeah.

19:33.500 --> 19:35.000
-Whoa.

19:35.083 --> 19:36.917
Or you being lifted out

19:35.083 --> 19:36.917
of the net by a cable?

19:37.000 --> 19:39.250
Whoa. (chuckles) Man,

19:37.000 --> 19:39.250
I don't even remember that.

19:39.333 --> 19:41.375
(chuckles) It probably

19:39.333 --> 19:41.375
happens all the time, huh?

19:41.458 --> 19:42.417
No.

19:42.500 --> 19:45.709
It's $19 for one

19:42.500 --> 19:45.709
or $20 for 50.

19:45.792 --> 19:48.125
What would we possibly do

19:45.792 --> 19:48.125
with that many pictures of us?

19:48.208 --> 19:49.917
(chuckles)

19:57.375 --> 20:00.583
This is great. (chuckles)

20:00.667 --> 20:03.000
I can't wait to see their faces

20:00.667 --> 20:03.000
when they notice these pictures.

20:03.083 --> 20:04.417
-Yeah.

20:03.083 --> 20:04.417
-(chuckles)

20:04.500 --> 20:06.000
You think tomorrow

20:04.500 --> 20:06.000
I'm gonna go back

20:06.083 --> 20:07.917
to being the middle kid

20:06.083 --> 20:07.917
that doesn't get invited

20:08.000 --> 20:09.417
to the strawberry festival?

20:09.500 --> 20:10.500
Honestly?

20:10.583 --> 20:12.000
Yeah, probably.

20:12.083 --> 20:13.583
(chuckles)

20:13.667 --> 20:15.458
But I won't ever see you

20:13.667 --> 20:15.458
that way.

20:16.709 --> 20:18.417
Do you want to hear something

20:16.709 --> 20:18.417
that no one else knows?

20:18.500 --> 20:19.709
What?

20:19.792 --> 20:22.834
Colleen and I are trying

20:19.792 --> 20:22.834
to have a baby.

20:22.917 --> 20:24.834
Oh, my gosh!

20:24.917 --> 20:26.625
-That's so exciting!

20:24.917 --> 20:26.625
-(chuckles)

20:26.709 --> 20:28.709
-Thank you. Now, you can't tell anyone.

20:26.709 --> 20:28.709
-(chuckles)

20:28.709 --> 20:30.291
-No, I-I won't.

20:28.709 --> 20:30.291
-Okay.

20:30.375 --> 20:32.417
Do you want

20:30.375 --> 20:32.417
to hear something first?

20:32.500 --> 20:34.667
-Yeah!

20:32.500 --> 20:34.667
-I have a boyfriend.

20:34.750 --> 20:35.875
Oh, Sam.

20:35.959 --> 20:36.917
He's a senior.

20:37.000 --> 20:37.959
Hmm?

20:38.041 --> 20:39.291
Isn't that so hot?

20:39.375 --> 20:42.166
(chuckling):

20:39.375 --> 20:42.166
Oh...
