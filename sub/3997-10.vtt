WEBVTT

00:00.564 --> 00:02.604
I can't believe they're playing
these old matches.

00:02.638 --> 00:04.438
- Man, these were legendary.
- Camel clutch!

00:05.233 --> 00:06.273
That's not a camel clutch.

00:06.274 --> 00:07.401
That is a camel clutch.

00:07.436 --> 00:08.803
Gentlemen, hi.

00:09.337 --> 00:10.777
I'd just like a moment of your time.

00:10.811 --> 00:12.611
- Jess, you can't turn that off.
- If I may.

00:13.090 --> 00:14.890
I have a word that's
gonna change your life.

00:14.924 --> 00:16.004
The answer is already "no."

00:16.004 --> 00:17.378
- Bathtub.
- Bathtub's two words.

00:17.412 --> 00:19.380
- It's one word.
- Bathtub is two words.

00:19.414 --> 00:20.414
How come I'm James Brown?

00:20.420 --> 00:22.660
When you don't smile
for my pictures, you get replaced.

00:22.984 --> 00:23.617
You come home

00:23.652 --> 00:25.653
after a long, hard day at work.

00:25.687 --> 00:27.755
- Tired.
- You want to relax, but how?

00:27.789 --> 00:29.090
How about soaking

00:29.124 --> 00:31.459
in a glorious bubbly pool for one?

00:31.493 --> 00:34.428
Sipping the nectar of the gods.

00:34.463 --> 00:35.983
I don't get it...
is this bath water?

00:35.984 --> 00:37.144
Might as well be;
It's rosé.

00:37.145 --> 00:38.466
Burn notice, France.

00:40.469 --> 00:42.570
- Now that I'm working again,
- Don't do this.

00:42.604 --> 00:43.724
I'd really love to come home

00:43.725 --> 00:45.106
and soak in a beautiful bathtub.

00:45.140 --> 00:48.142
Bathtubs are Medieval
filth cauldrons... pass.

00:48.176 --> 00:49.977
Yeah, it's a waste of money, Jess.

00:50.011 --> 00:53.180
I'm not interested in simmering
in testicle tea for 20 minutes.

00:53.215 --> 00:54.148
Loft vote.

00:54.182 --> 00:55.616
- No.
- No.

00:55.650 --> 00:57.930
Feel like I'm at a garden party,
haven't even left home.

00:57.965 --> 01:00.125
Winston, what are you talking
about... loft vote, no.

01:00.126 --> 01:01.366
What, yeah, no, duh, of course.

01:01.367 --> 01:03.591
- Okay, you know what... loft vote...
- Nay.

01:03.625 --> 01:05.426
- Loft vote.
- Nay.

01:05.459 --> 01:07.328
Loft vote, I'm turning
wrestling back on.

01:07.362 --> 01:08.329
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:08.363 --> 01:10.231
- Camel clutch! Camel clutch!
- No.

01:19.775 --> 01:21.142
Hey, Schmidt.

01:21.176 --> 01:21.812
Hey.

01:21.813 --> 01:23.573
Want to pitch on the
new Double V campaign?

01:23.574 --> 01:25.334
I'm all about the Double V...
what is that?

01:25.335 --> 01:26.255
It's a new vodka, yeah.

01:26.256 --> 01:27.815
Filled with vitamins...
Double V?

01:28.149 --> 01:28.983
What do you think?

01:29.017 --> 01:30.457
You know, I've never been considered

01:30.458 --> 01:31.458
to run an account before.

01:31.753 --> 01:34.989
Wait a min...
Wait, is this just

01:35.023 --> 01:37.625
is this because we used
to... bingity-bangity?

01:37.659 --> 01:38.759
No, of course not.

01:40.294 --> 01:41.495
Take a look at the specs

01:41.729 --> 01:44.131
and come into my office tomorrow
in your best suit,

01:44.166 --> 01:46.267
and, blow me away with your take.

01:46.301 --> 01:48.402
My best suit...
I can put on my best suit.

01:51.372 --> 01:52.406
Okay.

01:53.909 --> 01:55.944
Wasted project, Nick, huh?

01:57.778 --> 01:58.879
Herringbone?!

02:00.015 --> 02:01.649
How did you get in here?

02:09.297 --> 02:10.257
<i>To schmidt.</i>

02:10.491 --> 02:11.692
Sleeping his way to the top.

02:11.726 --> 02:13.494
Cheers to me.

02:14.763 --> 02:16.030
I hope
you like it.

02:16.364 --> 02:17.898
I poured that one for you.

02:18.933 --> 02:20.201
Drink it up.

02:20.410 --> 02:22.330
This is coming off weird...
it's creepy, right?

02:22.331 --> 02:23.651
- Go get her.
- I can't do that.

02:23.652 --> 02:25.172
- I can't talk to thirsty.
- Thirsty?

02:25.207 --> 02:27.208
I don't know her name,
so I call her Thirsty.

02:27.655 --> 02:29.575
- Thirsty Mendelson.
- Oh, you made her Jewish?

02:29.576 --> 02:31.936
- I didn't make her Jewish.
- Mendelson? She's not Jewish?

02:31.937 --> 02:32.497
Well, Thirsty.

02:32.498 --> 02:34.025
If her last name's
Mendelson, she's Jewish.

02:34.026 --> 02:36.146
Tell you what her first name is, too...
It's Rachel.

02:36.147 --> 02:38.747
Get out of my head...
you're kind of ruining my thing right now.

02:38.748 --> 02:40.188
What I have with thirsty is perfect.

02:40.189 --> 02:41.388
She's surly like I'm surly,

02:41.423 --> 02:43.023
and she rolls her eyes at everybody

02:43.058 --> 02:44.525
like I roll my eyes at everybody.

02:44.559 --> 02:47.027
She likes to drink in the afternoon.

02:47.062 --> 02:48.542
And I like to drink in the afternoon.

02:48.543 --> 02:50.164
- Go talk to her.
- No, I can't.

02:50.198 --> 02:51.498
That breaks the first rule

02:51.533 --> 02:53.701
of bartending...
never cross the bar.

02:53.735 --> 02:56.537
'Cause once you cross
the bar, it gets messy.

02:56.571 --> 02:58.839
Rudy just wants her $200 back.

02:58.874 --> 03:01.375
Come on, neither of you has
the right bra for this.

03:01.409 --> 03:02.977
Excuse me, have you seen Rhonda?

03:03.311 --> 03:05.212
Have you seen the ferret lady?

03:05.247 --> 03:07.081
Why am I doing this?!

03:09.618 --> 03:11.685
Never cross the bar.

03:11.720 --> 03:13.554
Your rules have gotten you so far.

03:13.588 --> 03:15.222
- Classic Nick Miller.
- You got it.

03:15.257 --> 03:16.824
Jess.

03:16.858 --> 03:18.818
You want to help me at the
jukebox really quick?

03:18.819 --> 03:21.179
Oh, my God, yes... I've always
wanted to do this with you.

03:21.180 --> 03:23.060
Well, I was gonna go
"Raspberry Beret," but...

03:23.094 --> 03:25.334
If we're gonna go Prince,
I think we should go, like...

03:25.335 --> 03:27.495
Jess, I want to talk to you
about your bathtub pitch.

03:27.496 --> 03:28.469
I love baths... I do.

03:28.503 --> 03:31.104
Back in Latvia, we had a great tub.

03:36.577 --> 03:38.577
But I tell you what...
there are parts of my butt

03:38.578 --> 03:39.663
only a tub can clean.

03:39.731 --> 03:40.998
Ew, but okay!

03:41.065 --> 03:42.385
Okay, here's what we're gonna do,

03:42.386 --> 03:43.306
so the guys don't know.

03:43.307 --> 03:44.994
We're gonna split
the 400 bucks for the tub.

03:44.995 --> 03:46.235
Then we can hide it on the roof

03:46.236 --> 03:48.316
and install it in the middle
of the night, and then

03:48.317 --> 03:50.717
we can just pretend like you
did it without our permission.

03:50.718 --> 03:51.807
Or we could just...

03:51.875 --> 03:53.275
say that you wanted a tub, too.

03:53.343 --> 03:56.211
How about we just keep this
a Jess and Winston thing?

03:57.514 --> 03:59.154
- Hey, Cece, you okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

03:59.155 --> 04:00.595
I'm good;
Just broke up with Robby.

04:01.918 --> 04:03.985
I'll make you a drink.

04:04.053 --> 04:05.554
What ha... what happened?

04:05.621 --> 04:08.189
I told him I had to start
getting serious

04:08.257 --> 04:11.960
about having kids and he said,
"Okay, that's cool."

04:12.028 --> 04:15.563
But then that's all he said
for the next eight hours,

04:15.630 --> 04:18.599
and he hasn't said
anything to me since.

04:18.666 --> 04:19.800
So terrible.

04:19.868 --> 04:20.935
I just, I can't even...

04:23.004 --> 04:24.244
I mean that's...
but I mean...

04:24.245 --> 04:27.140
There's... cool.
It's cool.

04:27.208 --> 04:29.688
- 'Cause you're single. You're single.
- Really subtle stuff.

04:29.689 --> 04:31.609
She's single now;
technically, you're single...

04:31.610 --> 04:32.810
are you not single? - Schmidt!

04:32.811 --> 04:34.331
I have to get serious about my future,

04:34.332 --> 04:35.852
otherwise my mom is going to set me up

04:35.853 --> 04:38.317
with a hundred sweet, gentle,
painfully boring Indian guys.

04:38.385 --> 04:39.919
Oh, my God, your mother.

04:39.987 --> 04:41.854
I want to control your life.

04:41.922 --> 04:43.442
That's how my parents met and they had

04:43.443 --> 04:45.058
a beautiful, healthy marriage.

04:45.125 --> 04:47.026
I respect your parents...
I do.

04:47.094 --> 04:49.334
I respect everything that...
look what they've created.

04:49.335 --> 04:51.563
Look at that... look at
your beauty, with your hair.

04:51.631 --> 04:53.465
I'd eat it out of a bowl, your hair.

04:53.532 --> 04:55.734
I'd put it in a bowl
and I'd eat your hair.

04:55.802 --> 04:57.035
Oh, my God.

05:00.206 --> 05:01.974
Hey, Cece.

05:02.441 --> 05:04.575
I-I know it's unexpected
that I'm here.

05:04.643 --> 05:06.844
It's because I wanted
to tell you something.

05:07.912 --> 05:09.814
You're my boo.

05:09.881 --> 05:11.716
You're my boo
and I'm... and I'm...

05:11.783 --> 05:13.618
I been missing you.

05:15.520 --> 05:17.515
I been missing you so long.

05:17.516 --> 05:19.756
You know what's weird?
I don't find this weird anymore.

05:19.825 --> 05:22.345
What's your problem, Nick... how
long you been standing there?

05:22.346 --> 05:23.546
How much of that did you hear?

05:23.927 --> 05:25.862
I'm in love, man.

05:26.530 --> 05:27.564
I'm in love with Cece.

05:27.632 --> 05:29.032
Everyone knows that,
you dumb-ass.

05:29.033 --> 05:31.043
- You always have been.
- I gotta tell her, man.

05:31.044 --> 05:33.004
You should do that, Schmidty,
that sounds great.

05:33.059 --> 05:35.219
- Do I have your blessing?
- Do you have <i>my</i> blessing?

05:35.220 --> 05:37.260
Yeah. I don't think you
need my blessing, big guy.

05:37.261 --> 05:38.341
Just kind of do your thing.

05:38.342 --> 05:39.982
I would like your blessing.
You're my best friend.

05:39.983 --> 05:40.823
I want your blessing.

05:40.824 --> 05:42.824
Schmidt, fine, you got
my blessing, okay? Just...

05:42.825 --> 05:43.345
What is this?

05:43.346 --> 05:45.481
Give me a hug. Give me a hug.
I need this.

05:48.585 --> 05:50.586
Come on, please, give me,
give me a hug, Nick.

05:50.654 --> 05:52.787
Please, just give me a hug!
I want...

05:54.555 --> 05:56.458
Good stuff.

05:57.526 --> 05:59.060
- Thank you, Nick.
- Come on!

05:59.128 --> 06:01.429
All right, looks good...
no leaks.

06:01.997 --> 06:02.897
We did it.

06:02.965 --> 06:04.999
Yeah, we did.

06:05.567 --> 06:07.502
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.

06:07.970 --> 06:08.902
It's flooding!

06:08.970 --> 06:10.538
- Do something!
- No, no, no, no, no!

06:10.605 --> 06:14.475
I've never wished
I was dead more.

06:14.543 --> 06:16.810
Schmidt's gonna freak out.

06:18.996 --> 06:20.214
He once told me he spent $300

06:20.282 --> 06:21.282
on a pocket square.

06:22.417 --> 06:24.584
No!

06:26.993 --> 06:28.254
Am I overreacting?

06:28.322 --> 06:29.355
Eh, that's about right.

06:31.118 --> 06:33.585
There you go...
good as new.

06:35.421 --> 06:38.189
So, I've, handled
this one-man job,

06:38.306 --> 06:40.475
any two-man jobs
you want us to tackle?

06:40.542 --> 06:41.902
I think we're good.
Thanks, Remy.

06:41.910 --> 06:44.278
You sure there's not something
else that needs fixing?

06:44.346 --> 06:46.647
Maybe in the...
lady's bedroom?

06:49.985 --> 06:52.452
Yeah, I think we're done...
thank you, Remy.

06:52.520 --> 06:54.788
I will return your ladder
when I feel like it.

06:54.856 --> 06:56.523
Thank you, bye.

06:56.591 --> 06:57.691
He's so weird.

06:57.759 --> 06:59.826
Okay, so, phase two.

06:59.894 --> 07:02.596
Didn't Schmidt make us
get renter's insurance

07:02.663 --> 07:04.998
when he almost tore down
that rafter with the sex swing?

07:05.065 --> 07:07.401
Jess, we fake a robbery.

07:07.468 --> 07:09.001
We fake a robbery for the insurance.

07:09.068 --> 07:10.168
That's a great idea.

07:10.236 --> 07:11.396
We're a couple of meth-heads.

07:11.397 --> 07:12.605
- Oh, yeah.
- Boom.

07:12.672 --> 07:14.907
Got any meth?

07:15.474 --> 07:16.809
Got any rings on your fingers?

07:16.877 --> 07:19.211
I need them for meth.

07:19.279 --> 07:22.114
Get it all, get it all, get
it all, get it all, get it all.

07:22.181 --> 07:24.016
Do we have to steal
my moustache trimmer?

07:24.083 --> 07:27.118
This is worth three bowls
of sweet, sweet meth.

07:29.321 --> 07:30.354
- This? This?
- No.

07:30.423 --> 07:31.823
No.
This?

07:31.891 --> 07:33.305
I just don't think
the meth-heads

07:33.306 --> 07:34.626
would want anything in this room.

07:37.262 --> 07:38.162
What about this?

07:38.230 --> 07:39.664
A land line?

07:39.732 --> 07:42.332
To me, it looks like a meth sandwich.

07:42.400 --> 07:44.367
Don't hog all the meth, daddy.

07:45.736 --> 07:47.003
Did you hit this already?

07:47.071 --> 07:48.371
- No, did you?
- No.

07:50.408 --> 07:52.208
What are you doing?

07:52.576 --> 07:53.856
You're smothering me, all right?

07:53.857 --> 07:54.617
I'm done with this!

07:54.679 --> 07:56.246
At least leave your wallet!

07:56.314 --> 07:57.780
I'm out of here!

07:59.000 --> 08:05.074

08:18.634 --> 08:20.135
Would you like a whiskey?

08:21.403 --> 08:22.204
What?

08:22.272 --> 08:24.673
I said that because I know you
like whiskey.

08:25.240 --> 08:27.276
You're a whiskey girl, like me.

08:28.344 --> 08:29.944
You're a whiskey girl?

08:31.012 --> 08:31.979
I'm Nick.

08:32.246 --> 08:33.313
I'm Angie.

08:33.381 --> 08:35.716
: Angie...
Angie, Angie.

08:35.784 --> 08:37.304
Well, what are you standing there for?

08:37.318 --> 08:39.187
Go grab a bottle
and get me drunk, idiot.

08:39.254 --> 08:41.554
Well, I-I couldn't drink
with you... I work here.

08:41.623 --> 08:43.503
Just kidding, I get drunk,
like, all the time.

08:43.504 --> 08:44.792
I've got a drinking thing.

08:45.860 --> 08:46.793
You got it.

08:49.163 --> 08:52.532
I also have all the access to
pistachios if you want, like, a full...

08:52.600 --> 08:53.920
I'll make my own mind up on that.

08:56.537 --> 08:58.138
He took my
doctor's appointment suit!

08:58.706 --> 09:00.707
He took El Capitan!

09:00.975 --> 09:01.874
Damn it!

09:01.941 --> 09:03.621
The only thing he left was
my summer suit

09:03.622 --> 09:05.062
with the lightning bolt on the back.

09:05.063 --> 09:07.413
I keep that in my summer bin along with

09:07.481 --> 09:09.315
my summer condoms...
citrus-flavored,

09:09.383 --> 09:11.150
for a more refreshing
summer experience.

09:11.218 --> 09:12.818
- That's a jar...
- Jar for sure, yeah.

09:14.488 --> 09:16.688
Look at this...
took my suits.

09:16.756 --> 09:18.355
Left the...
left the douche bag jar.

09:18.423 --> 09:19.790
Typical meth-head.

09:19.858 --> 09:21.578
- Typical meth-head.
- Yeah, it's a shame.

09:21.646 --> 09:23.686
Good thing that I have
a security camera in there.

09:23.687 --> 09:24.887
I'm gonna download the footage

09:24.888 --> 09:25.897
and I.D. this S.O.B.

09:25.964 --> 09:27.098
He's going down.

09:29.601 --> 09:31.237
I respect the amount you drink...

09:31.238 --> 09:32.238
- Oh,
- FYI these drinks

09:32.304 --> 09:33.537
- aren't free.
- Well, joke's

09:33.538 --> 09:34.971
on you 'cause Mike left

09:35.040 --> 09:35.939
with all my money.

09:36.007 --> 09:37.207
Oh, really!

09:37.275 --> 09:38.795
Then how you gonna pay for the drinks?

09:38.796 --> 09:41.412
Oh... probably with sex?

09:44.215 --> 09:45.749
Sorry...

09:46.816 --> 09:47.851
That is not pretty.

09:48.519 --> 09:49.185
Well...

09:49.253 --> 09:50.813
I was gonna let you have sex with Mike.

09:50.814 --> 09:52.788
- Oh...
- What? It's good.

09:52.856 --> 09:54.223
That was an old switcheroo.

09:55.791 --> 09:57.760
I just want to say you two, uh...

09:58.727 --> 09:59.042
What?

09:59.043 --> 10:00.963
- No, no, I don't want to say.
- Come on, what?

10:01.025 --> 10:02.905
I don't want to say.
I don't feel like it's...

10:02.906 --> 10:05.146
- The point is it's not my...
- What are you afraid of?

10:05.147 --> 10:05.907
You're thinking it.

10:05.908 --> 10:08.108
I'm not afraid, but... He's
kind of an ass... damn it!

10:08.109 --> 10:10.105
You think I should break up with Mike?

10:10.173 --> 10:12.441
No, no, that is not my place to...

10:12.508 --> 10:15.308
- Well, you did; it is your place.
- But I've been drinking with you,

10:15.309 --> 10:17.579
and I feel like you're
luring me in... Dump his ass!

10:20.149 --> 10:21.683
Damn it.

10:22.750 --> 10:24.885
I can't believe you'd say that to me.

10:24.953 --> 10:26.313
You should mind your own business.

10:28.056 --> 10:29.656
So many years of footage.

10:29.724 --> 10:31.125
This is from last May.

10:31.193 --> 10:33.094
I was trying to add an extra ab muscle.

10:33.161 --> 10:34.369
Jess, I can't take this...

10:34.370 --> 10:36.370
This is when I was experimenting
with faux hawks.

10:36.371 --> 10:38.531
- I can't, I can't, I can't take it, Jess.
- You can.

10:38.599 --> 10:40.399
- You're gonna blow this.
- My face is numb.

10:40.400 --> 10:42.302
This is when I was lowering
my bar sexually.

10:42.369 --> 10:44.609
- Why is my face numb?
- Okay, I'm gonna say this once.

10:44.610 --> 10:46.239
- Tighten up.
- Okay, yeah.

10:46.307 --> 10:47.667
I can't believe this is happening.

10:47.715 --> 10:48.795
It's such an important day.

10:48.796 --> 10:49.716
What's happening today?

10:50.276 --> 10:51.511
I just have to look good.

10:51.579 --> 10:54.079
Okay? Not like
some Ukrainian dentist.

10:58.317 --> 10:59.518
Oh, my God.

11:01.954 --> 11:03.714
- Jess, I'm dying.
- What's wrong with you.

11:03.715 --> 11:04.355
I'm dying, Jess.

11:05.958 --> 11:08.026
Jess, pretend you're not seeing this...

11:08.094 --> 11:10.761
Schmidt, this isn't a good time.

11:11.829 --> 11:12.863
Cece, please.

11:12.931 --> 11:14.965
Just... just open the box.

11:19.804 --> 11:21.205
You brought a pigeon into my house?

11:21.273 --> 11:23.407
I couldn't find a dove.
Come on, Beatty.

11:26.177 --> 11:28.697
It's... it was supposed to fly
out when you opened up the lid.

11:28.698 --> 11:31.014
- What are you doing?
- I love you, Cece.

11:32.381 --> 11:36.153
And I have been in love
with you for so long.

11:37.988 --> 11:39.122
I used to think

11:39.190 --> 11:42.191
it was just a heavy like, but...

11:42.859 --> 11:44.326
it's love.

11:47.464 --> 11:49.798
- There it goes.
- Is this real?

11:50.166 --> 11:50.866
For you?

11:50.867 --> 11:52.601
Yes.

11:54.169 --> 11:56.539
Cece, I'm ready for
a serious commitment.

11:56.606 --> 11:58.506
I'm up for a huge promotion at work.

11:59.074 --> 12:01.394
I'm ready to have kids with you,
if that's what you want.

12:02.076 --> 12:02.956
You want to have kids?

12:03.024 --> 12:04.664
Let's go right now,
let's go make a kid.

12:05.013 --> 12:05.746
Take your top off.

12:06.814 --> 12:08.049
Schmidt, my mother...

12:08.116 --> 12:09.850
she's gonna hate you.

12:09.918 --> 12:12.320
Okay? You're Jewish.

12:12.388 --> 12:14.555
She hates Jews; I mean,
she really hates them.

12:14.622 --> 12:16.156
Everybody hates the Jews.

12:16.224 --> 12:17.324
Your mom's in the majority.

12:19.126 --> 12:21.328
I'll convert to Indianism.

12:21.396 --> 12:24.264
Hindi... Hindi-is... eh?

12:24.332 --> 12:26.433
Indiani-Indi...
Indi-Buddhi-ism?

12:28.002 --> 12:31.304
Schmidt, we have so much
going against us.

12:31.371 --> 12:33.105
Let's have dinner.
Tonight.

12:37.976 --> 12:38.544
Okay.

12:38.612 --> 12:39.845
Cool. No, yeah, cool.

12:40.913 --> 12:42.181
Just give me a second.

12:45.585 --> 12:49.621
Yes!

12:50.989 --> 12:52.356
I'm sorry.

12:53.009 --> 12:55.005
Wiston, are you out of your head?

12:55.006 --> 12:55.775
Security camera.

12:55.776 --> 12:57.816
What are you doing?
Schmidt has a security camera.

12:57.884 --> 12:59.884
Why did I think he didn't
have a security camera?

12:59.945 --> 13:01.247
Oh. You're a briefs man.

13:01.714 --> 13:02.994
I was hoping I'd never find out.

13:03.062 --> 13:05.262
Oh, my goodness, we should not
have gone for that tub.

13:05.351 --> 13:07.319
I just like bubbles so much...

13:07.387 --> 13:09.267
Winston, I think you're
having a panic attack.

13:11.323 --> 13:13.557
Shut up, hey, Jess, no.

13:13.625 --> 13:16.660
I'm, uh... this is
just the willies.

13:17.428 --> 13:19.063
The w... the what?
The... the willies?

13:19.131 --> 13:20.691
The willies, yeah.
It's the same thing

13:20.692 --> 13:22.452
that happened when I
took my driver's test.

13:22.667 --> 13:24.068
Go ahead and start the car.

13:27.406 --> 13:28.872
No! No!

13:32.476 --> 13:33.836
A lot of people get panic attacks.

13:33.837 --> 13:36.037
- The willies.
- My dad used to get them all the time.

13:36.038 --> 13:37.838
Like, every time
he had to make a left turn.

13:37.906 --> 13:39.426
It would take him two and a half hours

13:39.427 --> 13:40.384
to drive me to school.

13:40.451 --> 13:42.731
We'd just drive all around
Portland, making right turns.

13:43.954 --> 13:45.388
- Okay.
- It's okay.

13:45.455 --> 13:47.856
- Okay.
- It's really okay.

13:48.425 --> 13:50.425
Are you going to tell
anybody about my underwear?

13:50.426 --> 13:52.028
Look, I really want to.

13:53.095 --> 13:54.696
But I won't.

13:54.994 --> 13:56.365
- Where is he?
- It's over, Mike.

13:56.433 --> 13:58.233
- Where's Nick?
- Just stop... just stop it.

13:58.235 --> 14:01.002
Hey. You Nick?

14:01.570 --> 14:02.570
I'm not Nick.

14:03.138 --> 14:04.378
Nick has pinkeye!
I'm Ricardo!

14:04.446 --> 14:06.606
- Let Nick go!
- Ricardo? Ricardo? This is Nick, huh?

14:06.607 --> 14:08.776
You're a dead man!

14:10.344 --> 14:11.479
I had it handled!

14:11.547 --> 14:13.348
He was gonna kill you.
I've seen him do it.

14:13.364 --> 14:15.204
I know someone at work
who can stitch him up.

14:15.205 --> 14:15.965
Okay, let's get him

14:15.966 --> 14:17.686
stitched up right now.
This is disgusting.

14:17.687 --> 14:17.887
Okay.

14:17.888 --> 14:18.952
<i>I'm out there every night,</i>

14:19.019 --> 14:20.286
balling to the max,

14:20.354 --> 14:21.621
and you expect me to do what,

14:21.689 --> 14:23.022
just stop and chew up

14:23.090 --> 14:24.558
some cherry-flavored multi-V?

14:24.625 --> 14:26.259
No, thanks.

14:26.327 --> 14:28.795
I'll take my vitamins
on the rocks. Double V.

14:28.863 --> 14:32.098
Heart. Spirit. Body. Party.

14:32.166 --> 14:34.600
You gotta get specific
about this vodka.

14:34.668 --> 14:36.001
- Have you tried Double V?
- No.

14:36.069 --> 14:37.336
Let's open up this bitch.

14:37.403 --> 14:39.171
Let's open up... okay.

14:39.238 --> 14:41.340
- I kind of...
- We're going to do every vitamin,

14:41.407 --> 14:43.776
in alphabetical order.
Each shot that you do,

14:43.844 --> 14:45.778
makes me know you're
going that extra mile.

14:46.346 --> 14:47.296
Emma, I really...

14:47.297 --> 14:49.297
Is there something more
important than work?

14:49.314 --> 14:50.781
- What?
- Okay.

14:50.849 --> 14:52.489
- But you said...
- No, I... no, no, no.

14:52.490 --> 14:54.250
Let's-let's just...
all right, we'll do it.

14:54.251 --> 14:55.291
<i>Don't feel weird, Winston.</i>

14:55.292 --> 14:56.572
Everybody has their weird thing.

14:56.921 --> 14:57.889
Even me.

14:58.700 --> 15:00.925
Look, I'm gonna tell you
something about myself.

15:01.593 --> 15:04.895
I am really claustrophobic.

15:04.963 --> 15:07.130
- Jess, I don't believe you.
- No, seriously, watch.

15:12.003 --> 15:14.371
- You seem fine to me.
- I seem fine,

15:14.438 --> 15:17.107
but if I close the door,

15:17.174 --> 15:20.210
it's gonna feel like I'm dying...

15:20.277 --> 15:22.845
even more than

15:22.913 --> 15:24.446
a real death.

15:24.515 --> 15:27.850
It just feels like death...
plus more death.

15:27.918 --> 15:29.351
Okay, this is silly.
Just come on.

15:29.419 --> 15:31.659
But I'm gonna be okay, because
I know you're out there.

15:31.660 --> 15:32.755
-- And you can help me...

15:33.323 --> 15:34.789
Oh, my God...

15:34.857 --> 15:35.958
Okay...

15:37.791 --> 15:38.711
Oh, my God. Let me out!

15:38.712 --> 15:40.552
Jess, this is not...
this is not funny, Jess.

15:40.553 --> 15:41.993
- Can you open up the door?
- Jess?

15:41.994 --> 15:42.891
It's closed!

15:42.892 --> 15:44.332
Oh, my God, Jess, the door is stuck.

15:44.400 --> 15:46.400
- It's so hot in here!
- Jess, the door is stuck!

15:46.401 --> 15:48.601
- Oh, my God!
- Jess, come on, now, this is not funny.

15:48.602 --> 15:49.842
Oh, my God... Oh, my God... Oh!

15:49.843 --> 15:51.803
Jess, this is not... oh,
my goodness, is it hot?

15:51.804 --> 15:53.844
- So you're not a nurse?
- Who said I was a nurse?

15:53.912 --> 15:56.112
Stitches... you said somebody
at work can do stitches.

15:56.113 --> 15:57.473
Who does stitches at a strip club?

15:57.474 --> 15:58.612
Someone need stitches?

15:58.680 --> 16:00.160
Let me get my needle and my bifocals.

16:00.848 --> 16:01.916
Be right back.

16:01.983 --> 16:04.552
Okay, let's get you down
right next to that dirty pole.

16:04.619 --> 16:05.819
There? That? Okay, good.

16:06.887 --> 16:08.689
Th... really nice place.

16:08.757 --> 16:10.623
This is where you work.

16:11.691 --> 16:12.531
You the ticket-taker?

16:12.593 --> 16:13.860
- No, I'm a stripper.
- Yeah.

16:13.928 --> 16:15.762
But what is it that you do here?

16:15.829 --> 16:16.897
Stripper.

16:16.898 --> 16:18.738
Because college is so
expensive these days...

16:18.739 --> 16:20.900
- I'm a stripper.
- But only topless.

16:20.968 --> 16:22.768
- Completely naked.
- Mike, where's my taco?

16:22.769 --> 16:23.929
What happened? What happened?

16:23.938 --> 16:25.871
He remembered that
he was married to you,

16:25.939 --> 16:28.541
so he tried to beat the memory
out of his brain with a brick.

16:28.608 --> 16:30.288
- Oh, he's married...
- You stupid bitch!

16:30.289 --> 16:31.377
Oh, not okay!

16:32.545 --> 16:33.579
Ladies!
Stop fighting!

16:33.646 --> 16:36.682
Hey, hey!
Stop this now!

16:36.749 --> 16:39.418
Don't stop this!
I'm super aroused!

16:39.486 --> 16:41.186
I think I just became a dirt bag.

16:41.253 --> 16:43.321
Why did I cross the bar?

16:46.525 --> 16:48.326
I did it.

16:48.394 --> 16:50.728
- I'm here for dinner. I made it.
- It's really late.

16:50.796 --> 16:53.196
We got the account.
I was with my boss, we got the account.

16:53.197 --> 16:55.533
- We did it.
- You were with your boss?

16:56.101 --> 16:57.234
What?

16:57.302 --> 16:59.182
- No.
- The woman who made you sign a contract

16:59.183 --> 17:00.903
so she could have sex
with you, your boss?

17:00.904 --> 17:01.024
No.

17:01.025 --> 17:03.140
No. Uh...

17:03.208 --> 17:04.340
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

17:04.409 --> 17:05.742
No... but nothing happened.

17:05.810 --> 17:07.170
She just wanted me to taste the V.

17:08.378 --> 17:09.613
That came out wrong.

17:09.680 --> 17:11.181
- Yeah.
- I thought about...

17:11.249 --> 17:12.983
I thought about the boss's boobs once.

17:14.451 --> 17:16.085
They're still real nice,

17:16.153 --> 17:19.088
but I didn't have no connection
to them emotionally, whatsoever.

17:19.856 --> 17:20.823
Nothing.

17:21.590 --> 17:25.328
Cece, I can pay
for our baby's college now.

17:25.395 --> 17:26.829
Literally anywhere they want to go.

17:27.195 --> 17:30.298
UCLA, UMass...
any of the U schools.

17:30.366 --> 17:33.235
- I love you so much.
- You should probably...

17:33.302 --> 17:34.469
Oh, not...

17:39.575 --> 17:41.543
It's okay.

17:47.081 --> 17:48.749
Cece, I'm gonna pee in my summer suit.

17:48.816 --> 17:51.018
Hey, Mom, it's me.

17:51.685 --> 17:53.387
I think I'm ready to
have you set me up.

17:53.855 --> 17:55.389
This is not a prank.
Call me back.

17:58.155 --> 17:59.595
- Oh, thank God.
- Oh, my goodness.

17:59.596 --> 18:01.958
- Thank you, man.
- I see.

18:02.025 --> 18:04.093
If you guys have been
playing hard to get,

18:04.161 --> 18:05.428
you don't have to.

18:05.496 --> 18:06.629
I am totally ready

18:06.697 --> 18:09.397
to get mixed up in this
choco-vanilla shake.

18:11.599 --> 18:12.534
No.

18:12.602 --> 18:14.362
Yeah, you know what
I'm talking about here.

18:14.363 --> 18:16.483
- I'm just talking about...
- Yes... I know, I know.

18:16.484 --> 18:17.564
We got it, we got it, Remy.

18:17.632 --> 18:19.872
- ...doing it with-with both of you.
- We got it. Yeah.

18:19.873 --> 18:20.193
Three...

18:21.143 --> 18:23.378
This never happened.

18:26.115 --> 18:27.515
Jess, I just want to say thank you.

18:27.583 --> 18:29.423
You know, I thought
I was the only crazy one,

18:29.424 --> 18:30.904
but it turns out you're nuts as well.

18:30.905 --> 18:32.920
Oh, I'm straight-up
bananas, Winston.

18:33.389 --> 18:35.156
Next time that happens to you,

18:35.224 --> 18:37.959
just come to me, and I'll
help you keep your pants on.

18:38.327 --> 18:41.128
So what are we gonna do
about Schmidt's suits?

18:41.196 --> 18:43.197
I feel like there's
a very obvious solution.

18:46.401 --> 18:48.535
Oh, come on! Again?

18:51.873 --> 18:54.608
Thank God.
The meth-heads came back.

18:54.675 --> 18:56.955
They brought your suits back
'cause they don't fit them.

18:56.956 --> 18:58.596
They did the right thing,
'cause they're

18:58.612 --> 19:00.546
- drug addicts, they're not monsters.
- Right.

19:00.614 --> 19:02.281
They actually got them
dry-cleaned,

19:02.349 --> 19:03.816
deluxe package, very pricey.

19:03.884 --> 19:05.218
Why'd he tie you up?

19:05.285 --> 19:06.919
They kept saying, like,

19:06.987 --> 19:08.921
"I'm so hungry for
more meth," you know?

19:08.989 --> 19:11.491
"Let's get rid of these suits.

19:11.558 --> 19:14.026
These clean... suits."

19:14.093 --> 19:15.560
Jess and I want a tub.

19:15.628 --> 19:17.462
We want candles and bubbles.

19:17.530 --> 19:19.531
Oh, damn it, Schmidt,
we want bubbles, man.

19:19.598 --> 19:22.501
I want to cover everything
up on my body with bubbles.

19:22.568 --> 19:24.568
You know, and then just
blow 'em off like this...

19:24.569 --> 19:25.670
and laugh, like...

19:25.738 --> 19:28.339
Get a tub, man.
Let's get a tub; I don't care.

19:28.707 --> 19:29.840
- Hey.
- You okay?

19:29.908 --> 19:31.108
What's wrong?

19:31.876 --> 19:33.978
I told Cece that I loved her.

19:35.047 --> 19:37.749
Then I got drunk,
and she called her mom, and...

19:40.685 --> 19:42.920
She's going brown.

19:44.056 --> 19:46.424
She wants to marry a brown man.

19:50.827 --> 19:52.362
- Schmidt...
- Schmidt!

19:52.430 --> 19:54.531
- Hey, man.
- Hey...

19:54.598 --> 19:56.599
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Hold it right there.

19:56.667 --> 19:58.134
Let it go, man.

19:58.202 --> 20:00.336
- Let it go.
- Okay.

20:03.574 --> 20:05.775
How'd you guys get out of your ties?

20:10.513 --> 20:11.780
Hey...

20:13.347 --> 20:14.015
Hey.

20:14.084 --> 20:15.484
What can I get you to drink, Angie?

20:15.485 --> 20:16.818
Oh, no, I don't...

20:16.886 --> 20:20.422
I just want to...
hang out.

20:21.190 --> 20:22.423
I've got this rule.

20:22.491 --> 20:23.958
Never cross the bar.

20:24.025 --> 20:26.127
And I broke that rule, and...

20:26.895 --> 20:29.230
Look, these 18 inches of oak

20:29.298 --> 20:31.966
are the only thing that separates me

20:32.001 --> 20:33.201
from guys like Sid over there.

20:34.736 --> 20:36.637
No disrespect.
I got your next round.

20:36.705 --> 20:38.038
Well, I don't have any rules.

20:39.973 --> 20:41.808
Don't do... don't...

20:41.875 --> 20:43.643
No customers...

20:44.945 --> 20:46.213
...behind the bar.

20:54.687 --> 20:56.688
Oh, Sid, you gotta...
You're killing me.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.957
Sit down and drink your beer.

21:00.327 --> 21:02.027
I'm a man with feelings.

21:02.095 --> 21:05.030
Feelings that are bubbling up
inside of me, and...

21:06.399 --> 21:08.033
...they're about to explode.

21:08.101 --> 21:09.981
I'd like for those feelings
to explode on you.

21:13.205 --> 21:14.905
You got this, dawg.
Look at you, dawg.

21:14.973 --> 21:16.508
Look at you!

21:16.575 --> 21:17.908
Look at your face, dawg!

21:17.976 --> 21:19.244
Look at your face!

21:19.311 --> 21:20.578
You got this, son!

21:20.646 --> 21:22.813
♪ Well, I love you ♪

21:23.681 --> 21:25.714
♪ And I've never said those words ♪

21:25.782 --> 21:29.083
♪ Well, I love you,
from the bo... ♪
