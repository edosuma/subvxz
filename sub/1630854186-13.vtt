<i>Previously on</i> Young Sheldon...
You got a roommate?

00:04.220 --> 00:05.180
No, it's a single.

00:05.380 --> 00:06.320
I have a chaperone.

00:06.520 --> 00:07.790
Why do you need a chaperone?

00:07.990 --> 00:10.220
Maybe they think I'm, like,
some kind of troublemaker.

00:10.420 --> 00:12.930
As the owner of the face
you punched, they're right.

00:13.130 --> 00:14.230
Do you play D&D?

00:14.430 --> 00:16.430
No. I actually just
sit in my dorm room

00:16.630 --> 00:18.300
and study because
I have no friends.

00:18.500 --> 00:19.700
That's a bummer.
Yeah.

00:19.900 --> 00:21.300
I think I'm gonna go.

00:21.500 --> 00:23.690
Bye.

00:24.520 --> 00:25.640
You should go after her.

00:25.840 --> 00:29.090
Why? She's a bummer.
You just said so.

00:31.030 --> 00:33.650
ADULT SHELDON:
<i>Many cultures</i>
<i>throughout the world</i>

00:33.850 --> 00:35.450
<i>relied on percussion</i>
<i>to send messages</i>

00:35.650 --> 00:37.450
<i>across long distances.</i>

00:37.650 --> 00:40.390
<i>For example,</i>
<i>the West African dundun</i>

00:40.590 --> 00:42.190
<i>was used to imitate</i>
<i>human speech...</i>

00:42.390 --> 00:44.020
(loud music playing)

00:44.220 --> 00:46.460
<i>...while I used my fist,</i>
<i>the wall of my dorm,</i>

00:46.660 --> 00:48.860
<i>and Morse code</i>
<i>to send a message.</i>

00:49.060 --> 00:51.630
(four knocks)

00:51.830 --> 00:54.980
That's just the letter "H."
What does that mean?

00:56.450 --> 00:57.600
Yeah?

00:57.800 --> 00:58.970
I'm here to talk to you
about your music

00:59.170 --> 01:00.870
and your abysmal
Morse code skills.

01:01.070 --> 01:02.010
What?

01:02.210 --> 01:03.340
Four dots is just
the letter "H."

01:03.540 --> 01:04.910
Was your message "Huh"?

01:05.110 --> 01:06.100
What?

01:08.230 --> 01:09.500
Paige?

01:10.570 --> 01:11.820
Sheldon?

01:12.020 --> 01:13.620
You know him?

01:13.820 --> 01:14.990
Yeah, no,
we go way back.

01:15.190 --> 01:16.320
What are you doing here?

01:16.520 --> 01:18.720
Would you believe me
if I told you I was working on

01:18.920 --> 01:21.230
a femtosecond laser
in the engineering department?

01:21.430 --> 01:23.030
Yes.
Then that.

01:23.230 --> 01:25.700
You know she's not old enough
to drink beer.

01:25.900 --> 01:27.530
I'm not old enough
to drink beer.

01:27.730 --> 01:29.170
Yeah, one second.

01:29.370 --> 01:31.500
Come here.

01:31.700 --> 01:33.140
Did I convince you
that drinking is wrong?

01:33.340 --> 01:34.240
Good for me.

01:34.440 --> 01:35.370
Just leave me alone.

01:35.570 --> 01:37.110
But what are you doing here?

01:37.310 --> 01:38.680
I'm trying to have fun,

01:38.880 --> 01:40.980
and I don't want them to know
how old I am.
Why?

01:41.180 --> 01:43.520
Because I want them to think
that I'm cool.

01:43.720 --> 01:45.650
But you're smart.
What's cooler than that?

01:45.850 --> 01:47.320
Just go away.

01:47.520 --> 01:50.290
Hey, we're fixing to play
some beer-pong. You in?

01:50.490 --> 01:51.720
You should know,
she is not...

01:51.920 --> 01:53.690
Not had dinner. I have
not had dinner yet, so

01:53.890 --> 01:55.130
we are going
to go get some food.

01:55.330 --> 01:56.400
We are?

01:56.600 --> 01:57.830
Do you have cash?
Of course.

01:58.030 --> 01:59.270
I always have
an emergency 20,

01:59.470 --> 02:00.800
plus four quarters
for the telephone.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.600
21 bucks?
Okay, you're buying.

02:02.800 --> 02:04.200
We're going the wrong way.

02:04.400 --> 02:06.360
Okay, well, I'm drunk.
You lead.

02:07.120 --> 02:09.840
* Nobody else
is stronger than I am *

02:10.040 --> 02:12.650
* Yesterday I moved a mountain *

02:12.850 --> 02:14.980
* I bet I could be your hero *

02:15.180 --> 02:18.080
* I am a mighty little man *

02:18.280 --> 02:21.900
* <i>I am a mighty little man.</i> *

02:25.140 --> 02:26.290
<i>DINOSAUR (on TV):</i>
<i>Here, take a look at this.</i>

02:26.490 --> 02:28.490
Does this look like tuna to you?

02:28.690 --> 02:30.060
(laughs)

02:30.260 --> 02:31.830
What am I watching?

02:32.030 --> 02:33.770
It's called <i>Dinosaurs.</i>

02:33.970 --> 02:37.240
It's like <i>The Flintstones,</i>
only with dinosaurs. Come on.

02:37.440 --> 02:38.570
Well, that's dumb.

02:38.770 --> 02:40.970
Well, they talk, he's
got a job. It's fun.

02:41.170 --> 02:44.110
Wasn't <i>The Flintstones</i>
just <i>The Honeymooners?</i>

02:44.310 --> 02:46.810
Huh, I never even
thought about that.

02:47.010 --> 02:49.050
Well, see, you just
kind of ruined it for me.

02:49.250 --> 02:50.250
Good.

02:50.450 --> 02:51.720
Hey.

02:51.920 --> 02:53.850
Please tell me you brought
some movies home.

02:54.050 --> 02:56.790
<i>Tootsie.</i>
Ooh, thank you.

02:56.990 --> 02:57.860
Really? We're supposed
to believe

02:58.060 --> 02:59.460
Dustin Hoffman is a woman?

02:59.660 --> 03:01.980
But we believe
talking dinosaurs?

03:02.680 --> 03:04.660
Okay, I'll leave you to it.

03:04.860 --> 03:06.400
Little late
to start a movie.

03:06.600 --> 03:07.600
It's 8:00.

03:07.800 --> 03:09.070
We're saying the same thing.

03:09.270 --> 03:10.340
So, you want to go home?

03:10.540 --> 03:12.940
Well, I don't know.
I stayed here last night.

03:13.140 --> 03:14.270
So?

03:14.470 --> 03:15.770
So, two nights in a row.

03:15.970 --> 03:18.010
At what point
are we living together?

03:18.210 --> 03:19.550
Fine. Go home.

03:19.750 --> 03:22.880
Oh, I'm okay with staying.
You're the independent one.

03:23.080 --> 03:25.780
If you want to stay, stay.
If you want to go, go.

03:25.980 --> 03:29.560
Fine. I'll stay
if you're gonna beg.

03:29.760 --> 03:31.490
And this isn't what I wanted.

03:31.690 --> 03:33.230
Are you still inebriated,
or can we have

03:33.430 --> 03:34.960
an intelligent conversation?

03:35.160 --> 03:37.130
Both.

03:37.330 --> 03:39.930
You do realize that
alcohol kills brain cells.

03:40.130 --> 03:42.200
Ah, but it also makes
life tolerable.

03:42.400 --> 03:43.640
What do you mean?

03:43.840 --> 03:45.100
Well, talking to you
is usually annoying.

03:45.300 --> 03:47.540
So you're what's called
a mean drunk. Noted.

03:47.740 --> 03:48.910
I'm messing with you.

03:49.110 --> 03:50.710
It's just, sometimes
life sucks,

03:50.910 --> 03:52.650
and it's easier
not to deal with it.

03:52.850 --> 03:54.780
Could you be more specific?

03:54.980 --> 03:59.150
Um... well, I
have no friends,

03:59.350 --> 04:02.090
I don't fit in anywhere,
and I dropped out of college

04:02.290 --> 04:03.660
but I'm too young
to get a job,

04:03.860 --> 04:07.640
so killing brain cells
makes it easier.

04:08.410 --> 04:09.700
Huh.

04:09.900 --> 04:13.650
Go ahead, smart guy, fix me.

04:14.420 --> 04:15.730
Mm.

04:15.930 --> 04:17.300
Well, give me a minute.
(stammers)

04:17.500 --> 04:22.070
* Sweet Tootsie roll... *

04:22.270 --> 04:26.010
Well, how do they not see
that's Dustin Hoffman?

04:26.210 --> 04:27.410
I buy it.

04:27.610 --> 04:29.620
So if I put on
a wig and lipstick,

04:29.820 --> 04:30.920
you'd think I was a chick?

04:31.120 --> 04:33.350
(chuckles)
Only one way to find out.

04:33.550 --> 04:35.690
Nice try.

04:35.890 --> 04:38.370
You do have some pretty
nice legs, though.

04:40.810 --> 04:43.260
Well, if you want,
we could pause the movie,

04:43.460 --> 04:46.130
and I'll let you
touch 'em.

04:46.330 --> 04:48.270
Lucky me.

04:48.470 --> 04:51.300
So I'm assuming you haven't
taken the DARE pledge.

04:51.500 --> 04:52.610
The what?

04:52.810 --> 04:54.010
DARE. It's an acronym.

04:54.210 --> 04:56.170
It stands for Drug Abuse
Resistance Education.

04:56.380 --> 04:58.280
It's not too late.
You can take it now.

04:58.480 --> 05:01.550
I promise not to do drugs,
to avoid violence,

05:01.750 --> 05:04.350
to be responsible, and to
make responsible choices.

05:04.550 --> 05:06.120
Now you say it.

05:06.320 --> 05:07.490
No.

05:07.690 --> 05:08.850
I dare you.

05:09.050 --> 05:10.190
Clever, right?

05:10.390 --> 05:11.720
Because I still have
all my brain cells.

05:11.920 --> 05:14.110
Sheldon, just eat your pizza.

05:16.710 --> 05:19.260
Hey. You guys going to a party?

05:19.470 --> 05:20.600
Uh, Gamma Kappa house.

05:20.800 --> 05:22.170
Cool.

05:22.370 --> 05:24.500
Mm, you know,
Officer McDaniel was in charge

05:24.700 --> 05:26.140
of our DARE program.

05:26.340 --> 05:28.770
One time, he even brought in
his drug-sniffing dog Alfie.

05:28.970 --> 05:30.680
Which I didn't care for,
but it was nice to see

05:30.880 --> 05:32.460
a dog gainfully employed
and off the streets.

05:33.560 --> 05:36.550
MEEMAW:
Really? You're gonna
leave your socks on?

05:36.750 --> 05:37.880
DALE:
My feet get cold.

05:38.080 --> 05:40.150
MEEMAW: Take 'em off.
DALE: What do you care?

05:40.350 --> 05:42.150
MEEMAW:
It feels like
a lack of commitment.

05:42.350 --> 05:44.590
DALE:
Aw, fine.

05:44.790 --> 05:46.960
MEEMAW:
When was the last time
you cut your toenails?

05:47.160 --> 05:48.290
DALE:
I don't know.

05:48.490 --> 05:49.830
MEEMAW:
Seriously, you look
like something

05:50.030 --> 05:51.530
that could swoop down
and pick up a squirrel.

05:51.730 --> 05:53.500
(knock on door)

05:53.700 --> 05:55.800
Look who's here. Come on in.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.500
Thanks.

05:57.700 --> 05:58.800
Everything okay?

05:59.000 --> 06:00.710
Mind if I hang out here
with y'all?

06:00.910 --> 06:01.970
Come on, mama.
(pats couch)

06:02.170 --> 06:04.040
Need a break from Connie?

06:04.240 --> 06:09.150
I'm just trying to give
her and Dale some privacy.

06:09.350 --> 06:11.120
Gross.
Oh.

06:11.320 --> 06:12.800
What?

06:13.570 --> 06:16.250
Oh, nasty.

06:16.460 --> 06:17.260
Wait, sex, right?

06:17.460 --> 06:18.260
Yeah.

06:18.460 --> 06:19.860
Missy's at a sleepover

06:20.060 --> 06:21.530
if you want to use her room.

06:21.730 --> 06:23.160
I might take
you up on that.

06:23.360 --> 06:26.010
You'll be safe here.
They never do anything.

06:27.820 --> 06:30.600
(rock music playing,
lively chatter)

06:30.800 --> 06:32.340
What are we
doing here?

06:32.540 --> 06:34.210
It's a party, Sheldon.

06:34.410 --> 06:36.680
But we weren't invited.
I didn't bring a gift.

06:36.880 --> 06:38.940
Then go home.

06:39.140 --> 06:41.110
Wait, this is dangerous.

06:41.310 --> 06:43.550
ADULT SHELDON:
<i>There I stood,</i>
<i>the classic hero</i>

06:43.750 --> 06:45.380
<i>outside the dragon's cave.</i>

06:45.580 --> 06:48.550
<i>Should I risk life and limb</i>
<i>to save the maiden?</i>

06:48.750 --> 06:50.520
<i>My every instinct said no.</i>

06:50.720 --> 06:53.830
<i>But I drank a lot of root beer</i>
<i>and really had to go pee-pee.</i>

Hell does exist.

07:09.610 --> 07:13.560
Excuse me. Where's
the nearest restroom?

07:14.660 --> 07:16.950

Oh, thank goodness.

07:32.900 --> 07:33.500
Come on!

07:33.700 --> 07:36.490
Hey, there's a line.

Oh, boy. New hell.

07:46.380 --> 07:48.510
What?!
Charley horse. Charley horse.

07:48.710 --> 07:50.320
What-what do I do?
I don't know. (stammers)

07:50.520 --> 07:52.650
Here, rub it,
rub it, rub it.

07:52.850 --> 07:54.550
That's kind of how this whole
thing got started. (snickers)

07:54.750 --> 07:56.250
That's not funny.
Mm-hmm.

07:56.450 --> 07:58.140
You'll laugh later.

07:58.940 --> 08:00.430
DALE:
Rub harder. Harder.

08:00.630 --> 08:01.590

I'm rubbing as
hard as I can.

Well, use your elbow.

(Dale groaning)

08:04.860 --> 08:06.130
I don't need my toothbrush.

You like that?

Oh, yeah, yeah.

Do Mom and Dad know

Do Mom and Dad know
you're here?

08:45.500 --> 08:46.640
Okay, stop. You go first.

08:46.840 --> 08:48.610
Heather's sister
goes to school here.

08:48.810 --> 08:51.180
She invited us.
Now you.

08:51.380 --> 08:52.910
I'm looking after Paige.

08:53.110 --> 08:54.850
Where is she?

08:55.050 --> 08:58.100
Well, I didn't say
I was doing a great job.

09:00.070 --> 09:01.120
Where's your toothbrush?

09:01.320 --> 09:02.620
I don't want to talk about it.

09:02.820 --> 09:04.460
(phone ringing)

09:04.660 --> 09:07.630
Who the hell calls
at this hour?

09:07.830 --> 09:09.260
Hello.

09:09.460 --> 09:10.730
Oh, hi.

09:10.930 --> 09:12.360
Everything okay?
Who is it?

09:12.560 --> 09:14.630
Heather's mom.
Oh. Is everything okay?

09:14.830 --> 09:17.500
You just heard me ask.
Wh-What's up?

09:17.700 --> 09:20.760
No, Heather's not here.
They're at your house.

09:22.220 --> 09:23.810
Huh.
What?

09:24.010 --> 09:26.340
Heather told her mom
she was staying here.

09:26.540 --> 09:28.630
(chuckles)
Classic.

09:31.530 --> 09:32.650
Paige is drunk?

09:32.850 --> 09:34.590
And high on what
Officer McDaniel's called

09:34.790 --> 09:36.990
Mary Jane, reefer and ganja.

09:37.190 --> 09:38.390
Is she okay?
No.

09:38.590 --> 09:39.760
She said her life is terrible.

09:39.960 --> 09:42.830
What?
Her life is terrible.

09:43.030 --> 09:43.830
What?

09:44.030 --> 09:45.510
(rock music continues loudly)

09:47.650 --> 09:50.120
(music stops)

09:50.990 --> 09:53.020
Her life is terrible.

09:54.290 --> 09:56.520
(crowd murmuring)

09:58.190 --> 09:59.780
(muttering)

09:59.980 --> 10:02.380
How's your sex
cramp, old man?

10:02.580 --> 10:04.380
Athletes get cramps
all the time.

10:04.580 --> 10:07.520
It comes from dehydration,
overexertion.

10:07.720 --> 10:08.990
I'll give you
the dehydration,

10:09.190 --> 10:11.790
but I didn't see any
overexertion, though.

10:11.990 --> 10:13.190
Why, Connie?

10:13.390 --> 10:14.930
'Cause it's fun.

10:15.130 --> 10:16.530
Well, just give me
a minute, I'll be ready.

10:16.730 --> 10:18.060
Why don't we just
call it a night

10:18.260 --> 10:19.230
and get some sleep?

10:19.430 --> 10:22.600
That's fine by me,
but just to be clear,

10:22.800 --> 10:24.940
you're calling it,
not me.
Yep.

10:25.140 --> 10:27.140
I'm good to go.
I'm sure you are.

10:27.340 --> 10:29.070
Yep.

10:29.270 --> 10:31.930
Damn tootin'. (groans)

10:33.760 --> 10:35.350
I don't know if it's any
help, but when I was her age

10:35.550 --> 10:37.550
and pulled this, it was
just to go to a party.

10:37.750 --> 10:38.980
(scoffs)
Oh, great.

10:39.180 --> 10:40.750
So she's at a party,
who knows where.

10:40.950 --> 10:41.890
GEORGE SR.:
You know what?

10:42.090 --> 10:43.920
I'm gonna go find her.
How?

10:44.120 --> 10:45.690
I don't know. I'm just--
I'm gonna drive around

10:45.890 --> 10:47.960
till I hear some carousing.
I'll go with you.

10:48.160 --> 10:50.360
Will you both just
stop for a minute?

10:50.560 --> 10:52.920
There's nothing to do but wait.

10:53.980 --> 10:56.080
Fine.

10:58.590 --> 11:00.110
Nope. Georgie, let's go.

11:00.310 --> 11:01.570
Let's check out that
creek in the woods

11:01.770 --> 11:02.640
where they found
the headless body.

11:02.840 --> 11:03.980
GEORGE SR.:
Will you shut up.

11:04.180 --> 11:06.040
(sighs)
Now what do we do?

11:06.240 --> 11:08.450
We can't just leave.
Paige is still in there.

11:08.650 --> 11:10.050
Maybe we should call Mom.

11:10.250 --> 11:12.450
I do have four quarters
for that exact reason.

11:12.650 --> 11:14.240
Paige?

11:15.240 --> 11:16.620
Wait!

11:16.820 --> 11:18.320
What are you doing?

11:18.520 --> 11:22.330
Well, this is Bradley, and
we're going to another party.

11:22.530 --> 11:24.060
Another party? It's 9:30.

11:24.260 --> 11:26.580
Bradley, do you know
how old she is?

11:27.420 --> 11:29.330
She said she was 18.

11:29.530 --> 11:30.800
Lower.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.340
Sixteen?

11:32.540 --> 11:33.610
Lower.

11:33.810 --> 11:35.690
Okay, I got to go.

11:37.560 --> 11:40.100
Thanks a lot.

11:41.960 --> 11:43.380
Come on.

11:43.580 --> 11:45.170
We're running again?

11:46.500 --> 11:48.140
We just ran.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.430
I'll tell you what.

11:58.630 --> 12:00.330
My daughter's never gonna
put me through this.

12:00.530 --> 12:02.370
Oh, really? How you figure?

12:02.570 --> 12:05.340
I'm gonna run a tight ship.
Set some rules, some boundaries.

12:05.540 --> 12:07.040
If she breaks them,
then she faces the...

12:07.240 --> 12:10.140
Oh, what do you call it?
Repercussions.

12:10.340 --> 12:12.040
(snickers)

12:12.240 --> 12:13.830
Why you smiling?

12:14.600 --> 12:16.650
I just can't wait
till you're a dad.

12:16.850 --> 12:18.600
Thank you.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.090
"Repercussions."

12:21.290 --> 12:22.790
It's a word. Look it up.

12:22.990 --> 12:24.360
(sighs)

12:24.560 --> 12:25.690
MISSY:
Hurry!

12:25.890 --> 12:27.530
This is as fast as I can go
in sensible shoes.

12:27.730 --> 12:28.590
(Paige retching)

12:28.790 --> 12:29.960
(groans)

12:30.160 --> 12:32.030
You okay?
No.

12:32.230 --> 12:33.500
Oh, dear.
What?

12:33.700 --> 12:35.630
I'm going to have the
mother of all blisters.

12:35.830 --> 12:36.800
(sighs)

12:37.000 --> 12:39.700
I'm worried about you.
Thank you.

12:39.910 --> 12:40.740
Well, don't be.

12:40.940 --> 12:42.640
I'm having fun.
You're drunk

12:42.840 --> 12:44.610
and you were about to get
in the car with some stranger.

12:44.810 --> 12:47.610
So? He was cute.
What's wrong with you?

12:47.810 --> 12:49.880
You're smarter than Sheldon.
Why don't you act like it?

12:50.080 --> 12:51.880
Um...
I am.

12:52.080 --> 12:54.350
If that was true, then how come
my pizza's still in my stomach

12:54.550 --> 12:55.690
and yours is in the fountain?

12:55.890 --> 12:57.320
(groans)

12:57.520 --> 12:59.390
What good is being smart
if you're all alone?

12:59.590 --> 13:02.160
Let's go to Sheldon's
so I can get you cleaned up.

13:02.360 --> 13:04.160
(groans softly)
Thanks.

13:04.360 --> 13:06.100
Just so you know,
you're not alone.

13:06.300 --> 13:07.470
You've got me.

13:07.670 --> 13:09.200
I thought we were trying
to make her feel better.

13:09.400 --> 13:10.770
(music playing quietly
over radio)

13:10.970 --> 13:12.910
I'll tell you another idea I
have for keeping my kid in line.

13:13.110 --> 13:14.910
Oh, can't wait.
I seen this show
where they put

13:15.110 --> 13:16.910
these electric trackers
on these dolphins.

13:17.110 --> 13:19.580
And with satellites, they
can tell exactly where they are.

13:19.780 --> 13:20.980
Dolphins?

13:21.180 --> 13:22.280
Go on.

13:22.480 --> 13:23.450
I'm gonna stick one
of them things in my kid

13:23.650 --> 13:24.780
so I always know where she is.

13:24.980 --> 13:26.520
So you're gonna keep track
of your daughter

13:26.720 --> 13:27.850
like she's an animal.

13:28.050 --> 13:29.540
Damn straight.

13:31.540 --> 13:33.580
Actually a really good idea.

13:35.680 --> 13:38.260
Missy's a good kid.
I'm sure she's okay.

13:38.460 --> 13:39.870
(sighs)

13:40.070 --> 13:41.270
I was a good kid.

13:41.470 --> 13:44.040
Didn't stop me from
getting into trouble.

13:44.240 --> 13:45.270
(chuckles) Me, too.

13:45.470 --> 13:47.420
One time,
I was at this party and...

13:48.290 --> 13:49.810
Actually, never mind.

13:50.010 --> 13:52.260
The important thing is
we survived.

13:53.030 --> 13:54.080
Yes, we did.

13:54.280 --> 13:55.750
(inhales deeply)

13:55.950 --> 13:58.180
You just want your children
to have an easier time of it.

13:58.380 --> 13:59.850
Easier.

14:00.050 --> 14:03.310
My baby's gonna have a broke
single mom and a teenage dad.

14:04.110 --> 14:05.690
Mm-hmm.

14:05.890 --> 14:07.530
Let me get you some more tea.

14:07.730 --> 14:09.260
Okay.

14:09.460 --> 14:11.530
You know what else is nice?
Hmm?

14:11.730 --> 14:14.170
I get to learn from
all your parenting mistakes.

14:14.370 --> 14:15.570
I'm starting to think

14:15.770 --> 14:17.400
letting you live this
long was one of 'em.

14:17.600 --> 14:20.570
Like that. I'd never say
something so awful to my kid.

14:20.770 --> 14:21.910
(scoffs)

14:22.110 --> 14:24.060
Thanks, big guy.

14:25.090 --> 14:26.380
(crickets chirping)

14:26.580 --> 14:28.180
You awake?

14:28.380 --> 14:30.430
Mm-hmm.

14:33.500 --> 14:35.320
I've been thinking.

14:35.520 --> 14:37.990
We don't have to spend
every night together.

14:38.190 --> 14:39.660
Wow.

14:39.860 --> 14:42.460
You're preaching to the choir
there, Connie.

14:42.660 --> 14:44.230
I've been lying awake here
for an hour,

14:44.430 --> 14:46.360
wishing I were back home
in my own bed.

14:46.560 --> 14:47.600
Really?

14:47.800 --> 14:49.470
Everything's
the way I like it there.

14:49.670 --> 14:51.100
Got a TV in the bedroom

14:51.300 --> 14:53.470
and leave the seat up
on the toilet.

14:53.670 --> 14:56.410
And thermostat's not set
to storing meat.

14:56.610 --> 14:58.410
I did turn the
toilet paper around

14:58.610 --> 15:00.850
so it comes over the top
like you like it.

15:01.050 --> 15:02.010
Like the world likes it.

15:02.210 --> 15:04.350
Don't start on this again.
(chuckles)

15:04.550 --> 15:06.250
Hee-hee.
(chuckling)

15:06.450 --> 15:07.950
So, we got a plan?

15:08.150 --> 15:09.220
We got a plan.

15:09.420 --> 15:10.910
Mm.

15:11.970 --> 15:13.230
(sighs)

15:13.430 --> 15:14.490
(grunts)

15:14.690 --> 15:16.960
So I'll spend
tomorrow night at my place.

15:17.160 --> 15:18.100
Yep.

15:18.300 --> 15:20.020
(sighs):
Oh, thank God.

15:22.520 --> 15:23.770
Where you going?

15:23.970 --> 15:26.840
Think I might have
to crank up the AC.

15:27.040 --> 15:28.640
DALE:
<i>'Cause I said "thank God"?</i>

15:28.840 --> 15:30.760
MEEMAW:
<i>No fooling you.</i>

15:33.630 --> 15:34.910
(quietly):
Okay, she's asleep.

15:35.110 --> 15:37.380
I put a trash can by the bed
in case she gets sick.

15:37.580 --> 15:39.150
Where am I supposed
to sleep?

15:39.350 --> 15:40.420
On the floor.

15:40.620 --> 15:41.720
Why can't she sleep
on the floor?

15:41.920 --> 15:43.020
She doesn't even know
where she is.

15:43.220 --> 15:44.560
I don't have time for this.

15:44.760 --> 15:45.890
I have to find Heather
before I lose my ride home.

15:46.090 --> 15:47.690
Fine.
But first,

15:47.890 --> 15:48.960
we have to get
our story straight

15:49.160 --> 15:50.360
about where I was tonight.

15:50.560 --> 15:52.060
There's only one story,
and it's straight:

15:52.260 --> 15:53.070
you were here.

15:53.270 --> 15:55.400
No, I wasn't.

15:55.600 --> 15:57.670
I was at Heather's,
and you didn't see me.

15:57.870 --> 15:59.500
Got it?
First I have to sleep
on the floor

15:59.700 --> 16:00.940
and now I have to lie for you?

16:01.140 --> 16:02.310
How 'bout this?

16:02.510 --> 16:04.340
Work with me, and I will
officially owe you one.

16:04.540 --> 16:05.540
One what?

16:05.740 --> 16:07.280
I don't know. One anything.

16:07.480 --> 16:08.880
"Anything" is awfully vague.

16:09.080 --> 16:10.820
What say we draw up
a contract or...
Sheldon, you went

16:11.020 --> 16:12.950
to a frat party; now there's
a drunk girl in your bed.

16:13.150 --> 16:15.190
That's the coolest college story
you'll ever get to tell.

16:15.390 --> 16:16.290
So I <i>can</i> tell Mom.

16:16.490 --> 16:18.220
No. Someday.

16:18.420 --> 16:19.720
When?

16:19.920 --> 16:21.830
Someday when we're old
and we can laugh about it.

16:22.030 --> 16:23.230
I got to go.

16:23.430 --> 16:24.630
(sighs)

16:24.830 --> 16:26.100
ADULT SHELDON:
<i>30 years later,</i>

16:26.300 --> 16:28.070
<i>still not laughing.</i>

16:28.270 --> 16:30.450
(crickets chirping)

16:32.320 --> 16:33.670
What are you
doing out here?

16:33.870 --> 16:35.370
It's the middle
of the night.

16:35.570 --> 16:38.810
I can't sleep
not knowing where she is.

16:39.010 --> 16:40.560
Yeah.

16:42.360 --> 16:43.280
(grunting)

16:43.480 --> 16:45.470
(sighing)

16:46.300 --> 16:48.220
So we're on the same page,
when she does show up,

16:48.420 --> 16:49.720
I'm gonna kill her.

16:49.920 --> 16:52.120
You're gonna have
to beat me to it.

16:52.320 --> 16:53.860
Not saying
I love her the most,

16:54.060 --> 16:55.840
but if anything
happened to Missy...

16:56.610 --> 16:59.200
She is your
little girl.

16:59.400 --> 17:00.700
Not so little anymore.

17:00.900 --> 17:01.500
Hmm.

17:01.700 --> 17:03.800
And I hate it.

17:04.000 --> 17:07.370
Well, pretty soon, you're
gonna have a granddaughter.

17:07.570 --> 17:09.010
Start all over again.

17:09.210 --> 17:10.790
(chuckles)
(snorts)

17:12.190 --> 17:14.000
You know,
I had an idea.

17:14.760 --> 17:17.350
I'm gonna put a tracker on her,
like they do with dolphins.

17:17.550 --> 17:19.680
You're making that up.
No, it's true.

17:19.880 --> 17:21.720
Yeah, wherever she goes--

17:21.920 --> 17:23.920
Timbuktu, doesn't matter--

17:24.120 --> 17:24.960
we're there.

17:25.160 --> 17:26.610
(snorts)

17:29.380 --> 17:30.610
(both sigh)

17:37.190 --> 17:38.240
(door opens)

17:38.440 --> 17:40.170
MISSY:
I'm home!
(door closes)

17:40.370 --> 17:42.240
(footsteps approaching)

17:42.440 --> 17:43.380
Hey.

17:43.580 --> 17:44.880
Hey to you.

17:45.080 --> 17:46.380
How was Heather's?

17:46.580 --> 17:47.550
Uh, fun.

17:47.750 --> 17:48.550
Pizza, movies--

17:48.750 --> 17:50.220
the usual.

17:50.420 --> 17:51.780
You look tired.

17:51.980 --> 17:54.090
I didn't sleep
too well.

17:54.290 --> 17:56.150
Oh. Sorry.

17:56.350 --> 17:58.570
Well, I'm gonna go to my room.

17:59.570 --> 18:00.930
What happened to killing her?

18:01.130 --> 18:03.030
I'll get to it.
(door closes)

18:03.230 --> 18:05.480
Just so relieved she's okay.

18:06.980 --> 18:08.300
(slurps, smacks lips)

18:08.500 --> 18:10.600
Okay, I'm good. Missy!

18:10.800 --> 18:12.590
Wait for me!

18:19.030 --> 18:21.650
