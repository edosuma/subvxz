WEBVTT

00:01.305 --> 00:03.438
- Sometimes I get a memory
of the car accident.

00:03.481 --> 00:04.700
- You know you can't fly again,

00:04.743 --> 00:06.049
not until you've dealt
with this.

00:06.093 --> 00:07.268
Don't make me
have to report you.

00:07.311 --> 00:08.443
- I kept your secret, didn't I?

00:08.486 --> 00:09.966
- Don't make me
have to lie again.

00:10.010 --> 00:12.490
- I'd like to request
some time off, sir.

00:12.534 --> 00:14.057
- I've been invited
to Selection Camp

00:14.101 --> 00:15.667
with Space Program Canada.

00:17.974 --> 00:19.497
[chuckling]

00:19.541 --> 00:22.065
- They found pre-cancerous
shadows on my MRI.

00:22.109 --> 00:25.025
She suggested a preventative
double mastectomy.

00:25.068 --> 00:26.504
You've been having contractions.

00:26.548 --> 00:28.245
- The baby's not due
for another two months.

00:28.289 --> 00:29.507
- Madison needs a hospital,

00:29.551 --> 00:30.987
can you take her
on the snowmobile?

00:31.031 --> 00:33.294
- It's not safe out there.
[distant screaming]

00:33.337 --> 00:36.210
- Mike! No. No!

00:36.253 --> 00:39.039
[sombre music]

00:39.082 --> 00:41.084
- His lungs weren't
fully formed.

00:41.128 --> 00:43.086
We don't have
a proper NICU here.

00:43.130 --> 00:45.045
He needs to go to Winnipeg.

00:47.612 --> 00:50.093
[Buddy]: You want me to sled all
the way out to some frozen lake

00:50.137 --> 00:51.834
just so I can be a Popsicle?

00:51.877 --> 00:54.097
- Ah, come on dude,
you said you were coming!

00:54.141 --> 00:56.186
The trick is to get wet
before you get in

00:56.230 --> 00:58.362
so you don't shock
the body too much.

00:58.406 --> 01:00.060
- Yeah. If you want
to freeze your nuts off,

01:00.103 --> 01:01.757
have at 'er Dougie.

01:03.193 --> 01:06.936
- Whoa! Damn! I feel alive!

01:09.286 --> 01:10.679
[grunts]

01:10.722 --> 01:12.594
- Dougie?

01:12.637 --> 01:15.249
[sombre music]

01:22.343 --> 01:24.127
[Hayley]: Help. Help!

01:24.171 --> 01:26.434
Please, we need help.

01:27.739 --> 01:29.480
[Wheezer]: This is your
captain speaking,

01:29.524 --> 01:31.308
we know you have a choice
when you fly,

01:31.352 --> 01:34.224
so thank you for choosing
SkyMed 911

01:34.268 --> 01:36.096
for all of your medical
emergency needs.

01:36.139 --> 01:37.314
- I thought you flew cargo.

01:37.358 --> 01:38.794
- Nowak's taking time off

01:38.837 --> 01:40.752
and Bodie's in Winnipeg
with the baby, so...

01:40.796 --> 01:42.363
- It's a temporary gig.

01:42.406 --> 01:45.148
- He's not a fan of medevacs.
Weak stomach.

01:45.192 --> 01:48.151
- Hey! My stomach
is very macho, thank you.

01:48.934 --> 01:50.371
It's my nose that's
a little delicate.

01:50.414 --> 01:52.547
But from what I hear,
it's a simple slip and fall,

01:52.590 --> 01:54.114
so how bad can it be, right?

01:54.157 --> 01:56.116
[tense music]

01:58.814 --> 02:01.512
[engine revving]

02:03.906 --> 02:06.822
- Doug? I'm Hayley,
I'm your flight nurse,

02:06.865 --> 02:08.084
can you tell me what happened?

02:08.128 --> 02:10.391
- I... slipped.
- HR's low.

02:10.434 --> 02:12.567
Hypothermia,
possible head injury.

02:12.610 --> 02:14.090
Did you pass out?
[grunts]

02:14.134 --> 02:16.875
Any pain in your neck or back?
Can you move your legs?

02:16.919 --> 02:19.008
[grunts]
Okay.

02:19.051 --> 02:21.271
- Ugh!
- Oh God.

02:21.315 --> 02:23.360
He's stuck to the ice.

02:23.404 --> 02:26.929
- You see this? This is why
I don't fly medevacs.

02:26.972 --> 02:28.844
[propeller whirring]

02:28.887 --> 02:30.802
[epic music]

02:37.896 --> 02:39.507
- The hot packs
will kick in soon, Doug.

02:39.550 --> 02:41.465
I know it's cold,
but we gotta warm you up slowly.

02:41.509 --> 02:44.164
- How are we gonna...
unstick him?

02:44.207 --> 02:46.078
- When my kid got his tongue
stuck to a fence,

02:46.122 --> 02:47.993
Lynn just used warm tap water.

02:48.037 --> 02:49.517
- The closest tap's
an hour away.

02:49.560 --> 02:52.041
We have to get him out of here,
we have to warm him up.

02:53.216 --> 02:54.696
- This is still hot.

02:54.739 --> 02:56.306
- Yeah, okay.
We just have to melt the ice

02:56.350 --> 02:58.439
around his back enough for me
and Wheezer to pull him up.

02:58.482 --> 03:01.093
- Yeah, I'm a pilot--
- Yeah, well this is a liftoff.

03:02.573 --> 03:03.966
- Come on.

03:05.663 --> 03:07.535
- Alright.

03:07.578 --> 03:09.667
- Careful, not too fast.

03:11.582 --> 03:14.324
- It's working. It's melting.
- We'll go slow.

03:14.368 --> 03:15.630
Gotta save as much
skin as we can.

03:15.673 --> 03:17.632
[electronic beeping]
- What is that?

03:17.675 --> 03:19.242
- He's going into V-fib.

03:19.286 --> 03:22.071
The coffee must have raised
his temperature too fast,

03:22.114 --> 03:24.204
we put him into an arrhythmia.
- Well, what does that mean?

03:25.509 --> 03:28.295
- No pulse, he's...
Ugh, he's arrested!

03:28.338 --> 03:31.950
- Okay, so what do we do?
- Um, we need to defibrillate.

03:31.994 --> 03:34.257
Chopper, I need you
to take over compressions.

03:35.040 --> 03:37.042
I need to work the defib.

03:37.086 --> 03:39.262
Arms straight, hard and fast.
You'll be fine. Come on.

03:41.786 --> 03:44.006
[suspenseful music]

03:46.356 --> 03:48.489
Oh God, he's in water.

03:48.532 --> 03:50.099
We need to move him.

03:50.142 --> 03:51.361
- What about his back?

03:51.405 --> 03:53.233
- Well, we can't save him
and it's not safe

03:53.276 --> 03:55.147
to defibrillate him in water.
We need to shock him now

03:55.191 --> 03:56.453
or he'll die.

03:56.497 --> 03:58.412
We need to get him
off the ice fast, come on!

04:01.502 --> 04:03.982
- Three, two, one, go!

04:05.462 --> 04:07.464
[gagging]

04:07.508 --> 04:09.684
- Let's get him on the board.
- Two, three, go...

04:10.772 --> 04:12.208
Alright, get his little
bootie on the board.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.601
There you go.

04:14.558 --> 04:16.125
[electronic whirring]
- Charging.

04:16.168 --> 04:17.431
200 joules.

04:18.780 --> 04:19.824
Clear...

04:23.567 --> 04:25.482
25-year-old male, hypothermic,

04:25.526 --> 04:26.875
surface injury
to the back and thighs.

04:26.918 --> 04:28.006
Arrested at the scene,
heart rate stable

04:28.050 --> 04:29.356
following defibrillation.

04:29.399 --> 04:31.140
- Bay three, prep warming
fluids and page surgery

04:31.183 --> 04:32.750
to assess his back wound.

04:32.794 --> 04:34.709
[phone ringing]

04:35.840 --> 04:38.843
- Hello.
- Hayley. It's Dr. Allen.

04:38.887 --> 04:40.889
I've been trying to get
in touch with you.

04:41.672 --> 04:44.109
- Uh, yeah, sorry.

04:44.153 --> 04:45.981
The reception
isn't great up here.

04:46.024 --> 04:48.375
- I have an opening
in the OR this week.

04:48.418 --> 04:50.812
I'd like to get you in
for your mastectomy.

04:54.859 --> 04:57.035
- Um...
- Hayley?

04:57.079 --> 05:02.780
- Uh, that's a lot sooner
than I was expecting.

05:02.824 --> 05:04.652
- This isn't something
we should delay.

05:04.695 --> 05:06.567
I know how difficult this is,
Hayley,

05:06.610 --> 05:09.004
but you need to make
this decision.

05:11.702 --> 05:15.184
- I'm at work, um...
my pager's going off...

05:15.227 --> 05:16.664
[phone clicks]

05:17.969 --> 05:20.494
- Relax, you feel ready.

05:20.537 --> 05:22.234
And the counselor wouldn't say
you should come back

05:22.278 --> 05:23.758
if he didn't feel
you were ready, too.

05:23.801 --> 05:25.629
- I just hope Pierce doesn't
ask too many questions.

05:25.673 --> 05:28.458
- With a face this open
and Polish?

05:28.502 --> 05:30.765
[chuckles]

05:32.680 --> 05:35.073
- Hey, nurse Tristan.

05:35.117 --> 05:36.988
- Hey, uh, Reese, right?

05:37.032 --> 05:39.295
- Yeah. I was just in 922,

05:39.339 --> 05:41.253
I saw you were running
light on towels.

05:41.297 --> 05:43.212
I know you like to use them
as bolsters for your patients

05:43.255 --> 05:44.605
so I restocked for you.

05:44.648 --> 05:46.998
- Thanks,
that's very perceptive.

05:47.042 --> 05:49.958
- No big, you're hard
not to notice.

05:55.442 --> 05:57.095
[knocking]

06:00.229 --> 06:01.448
- Sir.

06:01.491 --> 06:03.972
- Milosz. Didn't think
you'd be back so soon.

06:04.015 --> 06:06.975
- I'm ready to get back
to work, sir.

06:07.018 --> 06:09.369
- Well, I won't ask what you
needed time off to do,

06:09.412 --> 06:12.197
but are you sure you had
enough time to take care of it?

06:12.241 --> 06:13.938
It's only been a week.

06:13.982 --> 06:16.245
- Good to go, sir.

06:16.288 --> 06:17.681
Good and eager.

06:17.725 --> 06:19.335
- Well, we're short captains,

06:19.379 --> 06:21.598
and it's best for everyone
to get Wheezer off medevac,

06:21.642 --> 06:23.121
so...

06:23.165 --> 06:24.688
Welcome back, son.

06:27.691 --> 06:29.998
- Heads up. Guess who's
on the highway

06:30.041 --> 06:32.087
back to the danger zone?

06:32.130 --> 06:34.916
Or a sched to Shamattawa,
at least.

06:35.438 --> 06:37.397
Come on, Lex, I know you're
pissed but you can't ignore me,

06:37.440 --> 06:39.442
we're gonna be in a plane
for 12 hours.

06:39.486 --> 06:41.183
- I switched shifts
with Chopper.

06:42.402 --> 06:44.055
- Come on, Lex,
I'm taking this seriously,

06:44.099 --> 06:45.666
I'm not gonna have another
episode in the air again--

06:45.709 --> 06:47.494
- I'm not scared of you!

06:47.537 --> 06:48.582
I'm mad at you.

06:48.625 --> 06:50.540
You lied, Nowak. To me.

06:50.584 --> 06:51.802
[sighs]

06:51.846 --> 06:54.457
And then you tried
to get me to lie for you.

06:54.501 --> 06:55.893
You broke my trust.

06:57.025 --> 06:59.462
[pager beeping]

07:08.602 --> 07:10.430
- Look, I get why you're upset,

07:10.473 --> 07:13.041
but he's been dealing
with some heavy stuff lately.

07:13.084 --> 07:14.434
He misses you.

07:14.477 --> 07:16.218
And he could use
your support, so,

07:16.261 --> 07:17.654
what can he do to fix it?

07:17.698 --> 07:20.614
- I care about him too, Tristan.
But he crossed the line,

07:20.657 --> 07:22.050
and you let him,

07:22.093 --> 07:23.704
'cause you're in love with him.

07:28.970 --> 07:31.712
[birds chirping]

07:36.543 --> 07:38.196
- Kind of cold
for a garage sale.

07:38.240 --> 07:39.676
- It's just some stuff
I don't need.

07:39.720 --> 07:41.635
There's folks in the community
that could use it more.

07:41.678 --> 07:43.245
- You can't keep beating
yourself up, Jer.

07:43.288 --> 07:44.507
No one else is.

07:44.551 --> 07:46.944
[speaking Nêhiyawwin]

07:50.470 --> 07:52.820
- I got into med school.

07:54.735 --> 07:56.519
I wanted to tell you this time
so you don't think

07:56.563 --> 07:58.826
I just disappeared.

07:59.783 --> 08:01.524
- Congrats.

08:01.568 --> 08:03.047
I'm not surprised.

08:05.963 --> 08:07.312
- Great.

08:08.313 --> 08:09.924
Well, as long as you're cool.

08:11.142 --> 08:13.710
I'm late for a schedevac,
so, maybe you could give that

08:13.754 --> 08:15.625
to someone who can
actually play.

08:16.887 --> 08:19.499
- Lexi thinks
I'm in love with Nowak.

08:19.542 --> 08:22.458
- Uh, aren't you?

08:22.502 --> 08:25.374
You guys are great together.

08:26.027 --> 08:28.333
- Things are great,
but I've never done

08:28.377 --> 08:29.857
a relationship before

08:29.900 --> 08:33.208
and I've never
told anyone... that.

08:33.251 --> 08:35.166
- Come on. No one?

08:37.429 --> 08:41.303
- And if Nowak is expecting
the L Word...

08:41.346 --> 08:43.697
I mean, if that's how he feels,

08:43.740 --> 08:45.655
I don't know
if I can give that to him.

08:46.613 --> 08:47.962
- Yeah.

08:48.005 --> 08:50.530
L word stuff
is complicated, man.

08:50.573 --> 08:52.488
- Hey guys. This is Tricia,

08:52.532 --> 08:54.751
a 52-year-old woman
with colon cancer

08:54.795 --> 08:56.623
going to Winnipeg
for chemotherapy.

08:56.666 --> 08:59.234
- Tricia, let's get you
ready to fly.

09:00.931 --> 09:03.499
- How's Bodie's baby? Any news?

09:03.543 --> 09:05.196
- It's a wait and see.

09:05.240 --> 09:07.198
- What about your chest
tube patient?

09:07.242 --> 09:09.810
That was really impressive,
by the way.

09:09.853 --> 09:12.029
[chuckling]
- Yeah, that was scary.

09:12.073 --> 09:13.465
Good practice, though.

09:14.466 --> 09:16.643
- For stabbing people?

09:16.686 --> 09:19.167
- Uh, no.
It's for Selection Camp.

09:19.863 --> 09:21.822
- You got in?!
- Yeah.

09:21.865 --> 09:24.651
- That's amazing,
I didn't even know you applied.

09:26.653 --> 09:28.568
Um...

09:28.611 --> 09:29.743
When do you leave?

09:29.786 --> 09:31.092
- In a couple of days.

09:31.135 --> 09:33.529
But hey,
it's just Selection Camp.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.705
- You guys ready
to get out of here?

09:35.749 --> 09:36.706
- Chops?

09:42.277 --> 09:43.713
- Why didn't you tell me
Chopper's leaving?

09:43.757 --> 09:45.715
- It's not a done deal.

09:49.371 --> 09:51.678
And I wasn't sure
where you stood

09:51.721 --> 09:53.593
on the Chopper thing these days.

09:53.636 --> 09:55.769
- I don't regret
ending my engagement.

09:55.812 --> 09:57.118
It wasn't what I wanted.

09:57.945 --> 09:59.816
I'm just...

09:59.860 --> 10:01.557
I'm just having
a hard time figuring out

10:01.601 --> 10:03.254
what I do want, you know?

10:03.298 --> 10:05.039
- Yeah.

10:05.082 --> 10:06.867
Sometimes we don't know
what we want

10:06.910 --> 10:08.738
until it's gone, huh?

10:09.957 --> 10:11.785
[medical machines beeping]

10:11.828 --> 10:14.962
- How long until I can hold him
skin to skin?

10:15.005 --> 10:17.268
I've been reading
that kangaroo care

10:17.312 --> 10:19.401
is really important
for preemies.

10:19.444 --> 10:21.708
- Not until we remove
the umbilical lines.

10:21.751 --> 10:23.753
Do you want to hold him
in the nest?

10:26.103 --> 10:28.323
- Do you want to this time?

10:43.730 --> 10:47.037
What about... Cameron?

10:48.299 --> 10:50.867
Or baby James?

10:51.999 --> 10:54.871
- You need to eat. I'll, um...

10:54.915 --> 10:57.178
I'll go get you something.

11:03.314 --> 11:05.534
[phone ringing]

11:08.319 --> 11:10.582
Hello.
- Austen Bodie?

11:10.626 --> 11:12.672
This is Captain Paul Slater
from Air Canada.

11:12.715 --> 11:14.108
- Sir.

11:14.151 --> 11:15.675
- We have a ground school
coming up

11:15.718 --> 11:17.851
and you were a strong candidate
for the last intake.

11:17.894 --> 11:19.896
We'd like for you
to interview again.

11:19.940 --> 11:21.593
[chuckles]

11:21.637 --> 11:23.770
- Um, I...

11:24.596 --> 11:26.686
I have a situation in Winnipeg.

11:27.817 --> 11:29.340
When would I have
to be in Toronto?

11:29.384 --> 11:30.777
- Well, it's a three-day
interview.

11:30.820 --> 11:32.822
We'd need you here
by the end of the week.

11:32.866 --> 11:35.042
Take a minute if you really
need to think about it

11:35.085 --> 11:36.304
but don't take too long.

11:36.347 --> 11:38.045
You miss this ground school,

11:38.088 --> 11:41.309
there's no guarantee there'll
be another opportunity.

11:43.572 --> 11:45.139
- Miss Highway.

11:46.140 --> 11:48.098
Coming from North House?
- Winnipeg.

11:48.142 --> 11:50.231
- Brad Maloney was released
on bail this morning.

11:50.274 --> 11:53.321
His neighbours heard gunshots
at his house half an hour ago.

11:53.364 --> 11:55.802
We sent a unit.
They saw blood on the carpet.

11:55.845 --> 11:58.065
Brad was in jail
for targeting Jeremy

11:58.108 --> 11:59.719
in a drug-related hit-and-run.

11:59.762 --> 12:01.372
- Well, there's no evidence
of that.

12:01.416 --> 12:04.114
Brad said it was an accident,
he'd had a beer.

12:04.158 --> 12:07.378
- I sent a colleague to check
Jeremy's place in North House.

12:07.422 --> 12:08.902
He wasn't there.

12:08.945 --> 12:10.991
So, if he is in Thompson,

12:11.034 --> 12:13.297
I'd be very interested
in talking to him.

12:18.825 --> 12:20.565
- Jeremy!
[grunting]

12:20.609 --> 12:22.437
- It's not what it looks like.

12:22.480 --> 12:23.917
Um, mostly.

12:23.960 --> 12:26.006
[suspenseful music]

12:28.965 --> 12:30.619
- He's been shot in the stomach,

12:30.662 --> 12:32.229
how's this not
what it looks like?

12:32.273 --> 12:34.362
- When Brad got out of jail,
his hunting buddies

12:34.405 --> 12:36.146
started pressuring me
about Oxy again.

12:36.190 --> 12:37.626
I told you,
I'm not gonna sell this shit!

12:37.669 --> 12:39.410
- They weren't too happy
that old Jer here didn't

12:39.454 --> 12:41.804
have any money for all the Oxy
that they'd sent up

12:41.848 --> 12:44.459
and that the dumbass
had burned it all.

12:45.677 --> 12:47.636
[grunting]

12:47.679 --> 12:50.073
[breathing heavily]

12:50.117 --> 12:51.901
[speaking Nêhiyawwin]

12:51.945 --> 12:53.033
- What?

12:54.295 --> 12:55.818
No, his bosses did.

12:55.862 --> 12:58.125
- Look, I didn't know they
were gonna shoot anybody, okay?

12:58.168 --> 13:00.910
I thought they were just gonna
rough Jer up a little bit.

13:00.954 --> 13:03.391
And I was holding him,
and he saw the gun,

13:03.434 --> 13:05.523
and he freaked out,
and I got shot and...

13:05.567 --> 13:07.525
The next thing I knew,
he was dragging me here,

13:07.569 --> 13:09.310
not too goddamn gently either.

13:09.353 --> 13:11.834
- Your buddies knew you'd been
shot and they just left you?

13:11.878 --> 13:13.444
- They might not be too happy

13:13.488 --> 13:15.403
that I got arrested
for that hit-and-run.

13:15.446 --> 13:16.839
[chuckling]

13:16.883 --> 13:19.189
[grunting]
Ow!

13:19.233 --> 13:20.277
- This looks shallow,

13:20.321 --> 13:21.844
but you need to go
to the hospital

13:21.888 --> 13:23.541
for imaging to rule out
internal bleeding.

13:23.585 --> 13:24.716
- No, no hospital.

13:24.760 --> 13:26.457
They have to report
every bullet wound

13:26.501 --> 13:29.112
to the police. If I get
caught and go to jail,

13:29.156 --> 13:30.940
they're gonna think
that I snitched.

13:30.984 --> 13:32.159
And this is nothing compared

13:32.202 --> 13:33.813
to what those guys
are gonna do to me

13:33.856 --> 13:35.031
if they think I snitched,
you understand?

13:35.075 --> 13:36.554
- If you're not going
to the hospital,

13:36.598 --> 13:38.295
you're on your own.
Especially after you sent poison

13:38.339 --> 13:40.080
into my community.

13:40.776 --> 13:42.386
- I'm gonna make this
easy for you.

13:42.430 --> 13:43.779
If I die,

13:43.823 --> 13:45.955
Constable Lee is gonna think
that Jeremy shot me

13:45.999 --> 13:47.478
and he's gonna go to jail.

13:47.522 --> 13:49.350
And if I don't die,
and I get caught,

13:49.393 --> 13:52.179
I'm gonna tell the cops
that he shot me.

13:53.920 --> 13:55.312
You understand?

13:55.356 --> 13:57.445
- But he didn't.

13:57.488 --> 13:58.925
He tried to help you.

13:58.968 --> 14:01.144
- Yeah, well,
it's my word against his.

14:01.188 --> 14:03.494
You really gonna gamble
that our justice system

14:03.538 --> 14:06.497
is gonna believe some
Native dude over a white man?

14:06.541 --> 14:07.977
[chuckling]

14:08.021 --> 14:09.109
- Crys...

14:11.502 --> 14:12.895
You can take him
to the hospital,

14:12.939 --> 14:13.896
I'll take my chances.

14:13.940 --> 14:15.332
- I can clean it.

14:15.376 --> 14:18.509
I'll pack it with hemostatic
gauze to help it clot.

14:18.553 --> 14:19.989
- You have to take
the bullet out too.

14:20.033 --> 14:21.338
- That's a myth.

14:21.382 --> 14:22.731
Bullets don't need
to be removed,

14:22.774 --> 14:23.950
it can cause more damage.

14:23.993 --> 14:25.908
- Every bullet wound
has to be reported.

14:25.952 --> 14:28.084
If you leave it in there
and six months from now,

14:28.128 --> 14:30.782
I go in because
of appendicitis or some shit,

14:30.826 --> 14:31.914
and they find it?

14:31.958 --> 14:34.525
You take it out, now.

14:34.569 --> 14:36.701
[suspenseful music]

14:39.313 --> 14:40.662
- No. Not recently.

14:40.705 --> 14:42.882
- 18-year-old woman
with severe abdominal pain,

14:42.925 --> 14:45.362
history of ovarian cysts,
vitals are stable.

14:45.406 --> 14:46.929
- Bay two, let's have a look.

14:46.973 --> 14:49.236
- Nurse Roberts, Northern Police
is looking for anyone

14:49.279 --> 14:51.542
coming in tonight
with a possible GSW.

14:51.586 --> 14:53.414
I'm sure you know those
have to be reported.

14:53.457 --> 14:56.504
Even if it's someone you know,
Like Brad Maloney

14:56.547 --> 14:57.853
or Jeremy Wood.

14:59.333 --> 15:01.596
- Um, yeah, I haven't picked up
any gunshot wounds.

15:01.639 --> 15:02.945
But if you want to interview

15:02.989 --> 15:05.121
the endometriosis patient
I just brought in...

15:05.165 --> 15:06.818
- You'll keep an eye out?

15:07.950 --> 15:11.084
- Ah, wait, Constable Lee.
Um, which one's Brad again?

15:11.127 --> 15:13.173
I'm still kind of new here
and all of the guys

15:13.216 --> 15:15.349
in reflective vests
look the same.

15:18.047 --> 15:19.179
Hey Crys!

15:20.310 --> 15:22.399
What's going on?
- I appreciate the help,

15:22.443 --> 15:23.923
but you don't
have to get involved.

15:23.966 --> 15:25.489
Just, maybe if anyone asks,

15:25.533 --> 15:26.795
you could forget
you saw me here?

15:26.838 --> 15:28.057
- Crystal.

15:28.101 --> 15:29.711
I trust you.

15:29.754 --> 15:32.714
Look, no one holds themselves
to a higher standard than you,

15:32.757 --> 15:34.498
so if you're taking stuff,
there's a reason.

15:35.804 --> 15:37.675
What else do you need?

15:37.719 --> 15:39.982
- Are we really doing this?
Is this happening?

15:42.332 --> 15:44.465
[suspenseful music]
Yeah.

15:47.294 --> 15:48.948
[heavy breathing]

15:51.776 --> 15:53.778
[groaning]

15:55.867 --> 15:57.739
[shouting]

15:58.392 --> 15:59.523
- Goddamn it, woman!

15:59.567 --> 16:00.785
[groaning]

16:00.829 --> 16:02.004
Can't you give me something
for the pain,

16:02.048 --> 16:03.005
for Christ's sake?!

16:03.049 --> 16:04.964
[groaning]

16:05.007 --> 16:07.009
- 50 mikes fentanyl.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.102
- Hey, Hayley.

16:13.146 --> 16:15.148
This bench is really
killing my neck.

16:15.191 --> 16:16.888
You think you could be
a pillow for me, huh?

16:16.932 --> 16:18.760
- You know, you're lucky
you're getting fentanyl.

16:18.803 --> 16:21.502
[chuckling]
- Tough crowd.

16:21.545 --> 16:23.025
[coughing]

16:23.069 --> 16:24.722
- Did you dilute that?

16:27.769 --> 16:29.031
Are you serious?!

16:29.075 --> 16:30.380
How could you be so careless?!

16:30.424 --> 16:31.860
- I was... I was distracted.

16:31.903 --> 16:34.428
- You just gave him five times
the recommended dose!

16:34.471 --> 16:35.820
He could stop breathing,
he could arrest!

16:35.864 --> 16:37.561
- Wait, what?
- Uh, he needs Naloxone.

16:37.605 --> 16:39.433
We don't have any here,
it's locked on the plane--

16:39.476 --> 16:41.609
- Then go get it! Go get it!
- Wait...

16:43.045 --> 16:44.699
And what if we didn't?

16:44.742 --> 16:46.918
- What?
- What are you talking about?

16:46.962 --> 16:48.442
Are you crazy?
- Why should he get it?

16:48.485 --> 16:50.574
We never get enough Naloxone
up here in the first place,

16:50.618 --> 16:52.141
he's the asshole
who's bringing the Oxy up.

16:52.185 --> 16:54.056
He's the asshole
who almost killed Maskwa.

16:54.100 --> 16:56.232
- Hayley, we can't just
let him die.

16:56.276 --> 16:58.060
- Oh, my God, oh, my God,
I can already feel

16:58.104 --> 16:59.627
it's starting to hit me.
- Why not?

16:59.670 --> 17:03.152
He doesn't care who he kills?
What, we're supposed to just

17:03.196 --> 17:06.590
save him while his bosses
make Jeremy take the fall?

17:06.634 --> 17:08.070
- Listen, listen, listen,

17:08.114 --> 17:09.985
if that's what
you're worried about,

17:10.029 --> 17:12.379
I'll do whatever you want,
I can tell the police whatever.

17:12.422 --> 17:14.555
Just please, just go and get
Naloxone, okay?

17:14.598 --> 17:16.209
- How do we know you won't
change your mind

17:16.252 --> 17:17.906
after we give it to you?
- What?

17:17.949 --> 17:19.038
- You better make this fast.

17:19.081 --> 17:20.517
Fentanyl can kill in minutes.

17:22.389 --> 17:24.391
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

17:24.434 --> 17:26.480
[grunting]

17:27.568 --> 17:29.352
My Name is Brad Maloney,

17:29.396 --> 17:31.180
and I'm the one who's been
running all the Oxy

17:31.224 --> 17:32.616
up to North House.

17:32.660 --> 17:34.357
My bosses are in Winnipeg,

17:34.401 --> 17:36.403
I can give you all the names
and dates and everything.

17:36.446 --> 17:38.144
I can give you the whole
operation, okay?

17:38.187 --> 17:39.319
We good?

17:39.362 --> 17:40.668
[sighs]

17:41.843 --> 17:44.846
Jeremy Wood is not involved.

17:44.889 --> 17:47.153
He's not the one who shot me,
my bosses did.

17:47.196 --> 17:48.502
Okay? Is that good enough?

17:48.545 --> 17:52.332
Could you please
go get Naloxone, please?

17:52.375 --> 17:53.898
- That wasn't fentanyl.

17:54.943 --> 17:56.292
It was Valium.

17:56.336 --> 17:58.816
- Just enough to chill you out
for a little bit.

17:58.860 --> 18:00.775
- Ugh.

18:00.818 --> 18:02.298
- I'll drop him off
in the ER bay.

18:02.342 --> 18:04.213
He's stable and his wounds
are packed.

18:04.257 --> 18:05.432
I'll leave him in a wheelchair.

18:05.475 --> 18:06.694
You got that video I sent?

18:06.737 --> 18:08.391
- Yeah. I'll get
a burner phone and I'll send

18:08.435 --> 18:10.001
Brad's confession
to Constable Lee, okay?

18:10.045 --> 18:12.091
- Then we just have to get you
back to North House

18:12.134 --> 18:13.570
before anyone realizes
you were ever here.

18:15.616 --> 18:17.618
- You've done more than enough,
okay? I got it, Crys.

18:17.661 --> 18:18.880
Thank you.

18:21.056 --> 18:24.190
- Oh, hey. You okay?

18:26.192 --> 18:27.932
Why didn't you say anything?

18:27.976 --> 18:30.021
- I thought it was a graze.

18:30.065 --> 18:31.284
[grunting]

18:31.327 --> 18:33.242
- Lucky again.
- Ooh!

18:33.286 --> 18:35.940
- It's a bleeder, but you missed
anything important.

18:35.984 --> 18:38.465
- Maybe better if I wasn't
so lucky, you know?

18:39.292 --> 18:40.945
Maybe I could have done more,

18:40.989 --> 18:42.817
stopped them from bringing
that shit up here, you know?

18:42.860 --> 18:44.949
- Hey! Don't you dare.

18:44.993 --> 18:46.908
They forced this on you.

18:48.649 --> 18:50.346
And the community loves you.

18:51.739 --> 18:54.002
You help more people
than you know.

18:54.045 --> 18:55.395
Maybe you help more than I do.

18:55.438 --> 18:56.526
- No.

18:56.570 --> 18:57.788
- You stayed, so...

18:57.832 --> 18:59.486
- Crys, I...

19:03.751 --> 19:05.056
- You know when...

19:06.014 --> 19:08.669
When I told you
I got into med school?

19:11.324 --> 19:13.891
I was kinda hoping
you'd tell me not to go.

19:18.026 --> 19:19.288
- Hey.

19:25.033 --> 19:27.078
I've always been proud of you.

19:28.079 --> 19:30.647
Even when I was giving
you shit for leaving...

19:30.691 --> 19:33.259
I was giving you shit
for leaving me,

19:33.302 --> 19:36.218
not for going away
to become a kick ass nurse.

19:37.219 --> 19:39.439
And then community
will always be here.

19:39.482 --> 19:41.484
I'll always be here.

19:42.224 --> 19:45.184
But I can't be the reason
you don't go after this.

19:49.579 --> 19:51.364
- I love you.

19:53.148 --> 19:54.541
You idiot.

19:54.584 --> 19:55.933
[Crystal chuckles]

19:55.977 --> 19:58.327
- Yeah, I know, Flip.

20:00.416 --> 20:02.157
- Make sure you keep
the bandages clean

20:02.201 --> 20:03.941
and when this is empty,

20:03.985 --> 20:05.682
you can take it out.
- Okay.

20:05.726 --> 20:07.641
- And I'll be back later
to check on you, okay?

20:09.164 --> 20:12.559
You know, Thompson General's
a teaching hospital.

20:14.474 --> 20:17.477
Maybe they'll let me
do my rotations up here.

20:19.174 --> 20:20.480
- Worry about that later.

20:20.523 --> 20:23.047
Dr. Highway.

20:31.839 --> 20:33.536
[woman over PA system]:
Attention passengers...

20:33.580 --> 20:36.365
[indistinct chatter]

20:37.236 --> 20:38.715
- Reese, stop!

20:38.759 --> 20:40.369
Pierce, get out of the way!

20:40.413 --> 20:42.937
Get out of the... Pierce!

20:48.029 --> 20:50.814
- Oh God, this is my fault.
Is he okay?

20:50.858 --> 20:52.425
- Captain Pierce?
- I'm okay, Martine.

20:52.468 --> 20:53.730
I just can't move.

20:53.774 --> 20:55.297
- We're gonna get you out, sir.

20:55.341 --> 20:56.907
- The shelf
is too heavy to lift.

20:56.951 --> 20:59.040
- Didn't you hear me yelling?
- I'll start clearing stuff.

20:59.083 --> 21:01.390
- Careful Reese,
the debris could shift.

21:02.609 --> 21:04.175
[coughing]

21:05.133 --> 21:06.482
[both]: Fumes.

21:06.526 --> 21:08.702
- Evacuate. Everyone out now,
it's not safe.

21:08.745 --> 21:10.573
[coughing]

21:13.272 --> 21:15.535
- It's MEK.
- That shit's super toxic.

21:15.578 --> 21:17.928
- We need the P.I.G,
the universal spill kit.

21:17.972 --> 21:19.930
- Come on, friend, I'm gonna
get you some fresh air

21:19.974 --> 21:21.367
while I call 911, okay?

21:21.410 --> 21:22.672
- What happened?

21:22.716 --> 21:25.632
- Oh, a bit of a mishap here,
Green.

21:26.676 --> 21:28.461
- Is he going to be okay?

21:28.504 --> 21:29.723
- HR's high.

21:29.766 --> 21:30.898
SOB.

21:30.941 --> 21:33.030
- We need to sand down
the spill.

21:33.857 --> 21:36.207
- I can't see the full extent
of his injuries under the cargo.

21:36.251 --> 21:37.818
We need to get him out.

21:38.558 --> 21:40.299
[suspenseful music]

21:41.952 --> 21:45.042
- I tried to warn you, sir,
but I was too late, I'm sorry.

21:45.086 --> 21:46.261
- You weren't too late.

21:46.305 --> 21:48.307
I just couldn't hear you.

21:48.350 --> 21:50.178
It's my fault.

21:50.961 --> 21:53.703
My mom went deaf in her 50s.

21:53.747 --> 21:55.488
- You've got hereditary
deafness?

21:55.531 --> 21:57.490
- I thought I had more time.

21:57.533 --> 21:59.100
I needed more time.

21:59.143 --> 22:00.797
- If he can't hear,
he'd fail his medical,

22:00.841 --> 22:02.451
he couldn't be a pilot.

22:02.495 --> 22:03.713
- I shouldn't have hid it.

22:03.757 --> 22:05.498
I'm just glad
I'm the only one...

22:05.541 --> 22:06.760
who got hurt.

22:06.803 --> 22:08.370
- I think he's got
an internal bleed.

22:08.414 --> 22:10.154
He may have ruptured
his diaphragm.

22:10.198 --> 22:12.069
We need to get him out.
He needs an OR.

22:12.113 --> 22:13.419
[electronic beeping]

22:13.462 --> 22:15.290
- He's out of time.

22:17.161 --> 22:19.163
[suspenseful music]

22:20.339 --> 22:21.949
Clear a path!

22:28.085 --> 22:30.261
[whirring]

22:32.263 --> 22:33.917
- That's enough,
I can get to him.

22:36.790 --> 22:39.009
- Pull. Slow, slow, slow.

22:50.934 --> 22:52.806
- Hey, you okay?

22:52.849 --> 22:54.895
[sombre music]

23:00.509 --> 23:02.381
[medical machines beeping]

23:07.342 --> 23:09.126
- Butter chicken. Extra naan.

23:10.214 --> 23:12.391
I know you liked it
when you were pregnant.

23:17.396 --> 23:19.310
- Why are you here, Bodie?

23:21.530 --> 23:23.184
- He's my son.

23:23.227 --> 23:25.708
Where else would I be?
- You don't have to stay.

23:25.752 --> 23:27.710
I was prepared
to raise him on my own.

23:27.754 --> 23:29.538
I still am.

23:29.582 --> 23:32.106
- Look, I know I screwed up.

23:33.107 --> 23:36.415
I know it might take a long time
for you to forgive me but...

23:37.851 --> 23:39.505
I want to be a dad.

23:40.027 --> 23:41.420
I want us to be together.

23:41.463 --> 23:43.160
For us to be a family.

23:43.204 --> 23:45.772
- I believe that
you want this baby.

23:47.208 --> 23:49.428
I don't believe
that you want me.

23:50.429 --> 23:52.822
I deserve better
than that, Bodie.

24:01.309 --> 24:03.267
- There's the new papa!

24:03.311 --> 24:04.834
- Hey, Malcolm.

24:04.878 --> 24:08.403
The baby can't
really have visitors yet.

24:08.447 --> 24:10.274
- Well, that's okay,

24:10.318 --> 24:11.624
I came to check on you.

24:12.363 --> 24:14.104
You're family, Bodie.

24:14.148 --> 24:16.542
You don't have to do
everything alone anymore.

24:16.585 --> 24:19.414
- Look, things
with Madison are...

24:19.458 --> 24:21.547
tense, right now.

24:22.417 --> 24:25.246
I keep screwing up. It's like...

24:25.289 --> 24:27.727
no matter what I do,
I just make things worse.

24:27.770 --> 24:29.598
- Maybe you need a break.

24:30.599 --> 24:32.471
Come to Deep Lake,
there's a feast.

24:33.820 --> 24:35.735
Come on.

24:35.778 --> 24:38.041
Nothing moose stew
and fry bread can't solve.

24:41.262 --> 24:42.829
- You finished it?
- Yup.

24:42.872 --> 24:45.092
We're feasting to the drum
tonight before we use it.

24:46.572 --> 24:47.834
Come on.

24:48.704 --> 24:51.315
Bodie, this is your cousin,
Charlie.

24:52.055 --> 24:55.015
And that's your cousin Jordon.
- Hey.

24:55.058 --> 24:57.539
- And this is your uncle, Pete.
But we all call him Pebbles.

24:57.583 --> 24:58.627
[chuckling]

24:58.671 --> 25:00.455
- Am I related to everyone here?

25:00.499 --> 25:03.327
- Oh no, no, not everybody.
But a lot of people.

25:03.371 --> 25:06.156
And the folks you aren't...

25:06.200 --> 25:07.462
might as well be.

25:07.506 --> 25:09.072
This is your family, Bodie.

25:09.116 --> 25:10.509
- Aaniin boozhoo,Bodie.

25:10.552 --> 25:11.858
- You guys ready
to sing tonight?

25:12.293 --> 25:13.468
[speaking Anishinaabemowin]

25:14.208 --> 25:16.166
We've actually been practicing.
[laughing]

25:16.210 --> 25:17.385
- Okay.

25:23.304 --> 25:25.872
Okay, everyone ready?

25:34.620 --> 25:35.925
[sighs]

25:44.847 --> 25:47.850
[rhythmic drumming]

26:16.096 --> 26:17.663
It's okay, man.

26:17.706 --> 26:19.578
- Why am I crying?

26:20.491 --> 26:24.757
- Well, the drum is the first
song you ever heard.

26:25.714 --> 26:27.977
It's the sound of your mother's
heart beat.

26:31.764 --> 26:33.330
Your spirit...

26:34.941 --> 26:36.769
just knows it's home.

26:39.902 --> 26:42.165
Come on, man. Let's go.

26:50.826 --> 26:52.480
[electronic beeping]

26:52.523 --> 26:55.265
- We removed the umbilical lines
two hours ago.

26:55.309 --> 26:56.789
You can hold him
without the nest now.

26:56.832 --> 26:58.355
Skin to skin.

26:58.399 --> 27:00.619
Would you like me to help you?

27:12.761 --> 27:15.372
[serene music]

27:18.898 --> 27:21.161
I'm in the hall if you need me.

27:26.949 --> 27:29.299
[rhythmic drumming]

27:39.962 --> 27:42.008
[Emma]: It's so bright out,
you don't even need a telescope.

27:42.051 --> 27:44.140
- I have every
lunar event memorized,

27:44.184 --> 27:45.620
there's nothing
happening tonight.

27:50.103 --> 27:51.191
- Hi.

27:51.234 --> 27:53.715
[gentle music]

27:53.759 --> 27:55.282
- Emma.

27:57.327 --> 27:58.720
Hi.

28:00.940 --> 28:03.725
- Okay, so it's not
a meteor, but...

28:03.769 --> 28:06.162
I wasn't ready for what you
wanted before, Chopper.

28:07.250 --> 28:09.731
But I think I am now.

28:13.039 --> 28:14.257
- No, you're not.

28:14.301 --> 28:16.999
You're just upset
that I might be leaving.

28:18.131 --> 28:20.350
- Chopper--
- You like to have a plan, Emma.

28:20.394 --> 28:23.702
And I think maybe your plan
was that I'd be here waiting

28:23.745 --> 28:25.442
when you were ready.

28:25.486 --> 28:27.923
But if I leave,

28:27.967 --> 28:29.925
you don't have a plan anymore.

28:29.969 --> 28:31.492
- That's not true.

28:31.535 --> 28:34.800
I like you, Chopper. A lot.

28:34.843 --> 28:36.715
- I know.

28:38.412 --> 28:40.719
I like you too.

28:41.720 --> 28:44.810
Too much to try forcing this
at the wrong time.

28:54.950 --> 28:59.085
And I don't know why everyone's
acting like I'm not coming back.

28:59.128 --> 29:02.566
But I'm competing for two spots
out of 72 applicants.

29:03.742 --> 29:05.961
I'm just excited
that I get to go to camp,

29:06.005 --> 29:07.658
forget being an astronaut.

29:09.399 --> 29:11.488
- You'll be one of the two.

29:11.532 --> 29:13.229
I know it.

29:13.273 --> 29:16.929
- That's a lot of pressure
to put on a guy.

29:20.106 --> 29:22.717
- I came up here knowing
exactly what I wanted.

29:24.240 --> 29:26.765
To make money and bank vacation
for a wedding.

29:28.767 --> 29:31.073
And now I have money
and vacation and I just...

29:33.815 --> 29:35.904
I have no idea
what to do with it.

29:37.688 --> 29:40.561
- Well, maybe this is something
you shouldn't force either.

29:42.998 --> 29:46.175
Maybe you should just let
yourself not know what you want.

29:54.444 --> 29:56.272
- An extra ham and Swiss.

29:56.316 --> 29:58.927
And an extra PB and J.

29:58.971 --> 30:00.973
You know you get cranky
eight hours into a shift.

30:01.016 --> 30:03.889
- You done fussing?
- Adults don't fuss.

30:03.932 --> 30:08.154
- Fine. Let's call it... caring?

30:16.292 --> 30:18.468
- Hey, Nurse Tristan.

30:19.208 --> 30:21.384
I didn't get to see you after
everything that happened.

30:21.428 --> 30:22.908
Is Pierce okay?

30:22.951 --> 30:24.126
The wing tip, it was my fault,

30:24.170 --> 30:25.519
I really should have
been more careful.

30:25.562 --> 30:27.303
- Pierce got hurt because
he tried to hide the fact

30:27.347 --> 30:28.522
that he's losing his hearing.

30:28.565 --> 30:30.741
It's not your fault, Reese.

30:34.354 --> 30:37.096
- You were so cool
under pressure.

30:37.139 --> 30:38.706
Watching you take charge

30:38.749 --> 30:40.839
and knowing how to save him,
it was...

30:41.274 --> 30:43.624
Pretty hot, actually.

30:50.196 --> 30:53.503
- I heard you're expected
to make a full recovery, sir.

30:55.941 --> 30:58.334
- Everything except my hearing.

31:00.902 --> 31:02.382
Are you disappointed in me?

31:03.513 --> 31:06.081
- Sir?
- I try to be someone

31:06.125 --> 31:08.388
the younger pilots
can look up to.

31:08.431 --> 31:09.911
To have integrity.

31:11.217 --> 31:12.566
You were right.

31:13.436 --> 31:15.917
When we put on the gold bars,
it means something.

31:15.961 --> 31:18.920
It's a promise to put the safety
of everyone else first

31:18.964 --> 31:20.226
and I...

31:21.705 --> 31:22.881
I failed.

31:25.448 --> 31:27.494
That's the problem with flying.

31:28.147 --> 31:31.150
Once you're hooked,
you can't shake it,

31:31.193 --> 31:33.543
even when you know
it's time to step away.

31:33.587 --> 31:36.851
Sometimes you're just
not strong enough to do it.

31:42.596 --> 31:45.947
- Tansi,Uncle.
I came to see Jeremy.

31:45.991 --> 31:47.079
Did something happen?

31:47.122 --> 31:48.558
- No, Jer gave me the truck.

31:48.602 --> 31:50.517
He said he wouldn't
need it for a while.

31:50.560 --> 31:52.171
He knew I'd take care of it.

32:03.399 --> 32:05.749
[serene music]

32:32.298 --> 32:34.169
- It started with a tooth ache.

32:34.213 --> 32:37.651
But Nora didn't have the money
nor the time off

32:37.694 --> 32:39.783
to get down south.
And dentists are rarer

32:39.827 --> 32:41.176
than hen's teeth up here.

32:41.220 --> 32:44.049
So the dental infection

32:44.092 --> 32:46.268
has spread to her maxillary
sinuses.

32:46.312 --> 32:48.401
She'll need treatment,
an emergency dentist,

32:48.444 --> 32:50.403
and possible surgery.

32:50.446 --> 32:52.013
- Hi, Nora. I'm Hayley.

32:52.057 --> 32:53.449
I'll be taking you
to Winnipeg today.

32:53.493 --> 32:55.625
- Please, I can't be gone long.

32:55.669 --> 32:57.845
I live with my mom,
and she's in a wheelchair,

32:57.888 --> 32:59.107
there's no one
to take care of her.

32:59.151 --> 33:01.414
- We've arranged for a neighbour
to stay with her

33:01.457 --> 33:04.156
while Nora's away,
and I'll go check in

33:04.199 --> 33:06.158
on Mom personally, okay?

33:06.201 --> 33:07.681
[groaning]
- I know, it's awful

33:07.724 --> 33:09.117
flying with a sinus infection,

33:09.161 --> 33:11.685
but we are halfway
to Winnipeg now.

33:11.728 --> 33:13.948
[breathing heavily]

33:13.992 --> 33:17.169
- I need to get to her, my mom.

33:17.212 --> 33:18.648
I have to go.

33:19.649 --> 33:21.608
- Uh, no, you're on a plane.

33:21.651 --> 33:23.958
Your mom's fine,
the neighbour's with her.

33:24.002 --> 33:25.481
- She's crying. She needs me.

33:25.525 --> 33:27.701
I have to get to her.
Why won't you let me get to her?

33:27.744 --> 33:29.355
- You know what?
Let me give you something

33:29.398 --> 33:30.834
to help you sleep, okay?

33:31.270 --> 33:34.055
Easy, Nora, just...
just calm down.

33:34.099 --> 33:35.274
It's okay.

35:37.483 --> 35:39.746
- Nowak! We heard it
over dispatch,

35:39.789 --> 35:41.400
a patient tried
to crash the plane?

35:41.443 --> 35:43.837
- I was fine. I'm okay.

35:43.880 --> 35:46.013
- I love you, Milosz.

35:52.193 --> 35:54.239
- I love you too, Tristan.

35:55.022 --> 35:57.024
- I had Nora scanned
when she came in.

35:57.067 --> 35:59.505
This infection in her sinus
has spread to her brain.

35:59.548 --> 36:00.984
She has an abscess.

36:01.028 --> 36:02.551
- That can cause
psychotic episodes.

36:02.595 --> 36:03.813
- She should make
a full recovery.

36:03.857 --> 36:05.859
She let a simple infection
get out of hand.

36:05.902 --> 36:07.730
Listen, the police
are waiting to talk to you.

36:07.774 --> 36:09.558
They want to know
if you'll press charges.

36:13.649 --> 36:14.563
Are you sure?

36:14.607 --> 36:16.565
Hayley, you know as well as I do

36:16.609 --> 36:19.394
that healthcare workers
endure violence so often

36:19.438 --> 36:21.701
and we tend to just dismiss it.

36:21.744 --> 36:23.181
But it's a serious issue.

36:23.224 --> 36:25.052
- I know, but...

36:25.095 --> 36:26.662
Nora's already been through
so much,

36:26.706 --> 36:28.186
it doesn't feel right
to punish her for something

36:28.229 --> 36:30.013
that wasn't her fault.

36:43.810 --> 36:45.768
- How are you, really?

36:46.421 --> 36:47.944
Are you okay?

36:49.903 --> 36:52.035
- It's been a rough morning.

36:55.082 --> 36:57.432
A rough few days, actually.

36:59.521 --> 37:01.567
I lost a patient.

37:02.916 --> 37:05.179
I got attacked by a patient.

37:06.267 --> 37:08.791
I almost lost Madison
and her baby.

37:11.838 --> 37:13.666
It's just a lot.

37:14.971 --> 37:17.235
- This job is tough.

37:17.278 --> 37:19.889
Not everyone
can hack it up here.

37:22.327 --> 37:24.416
- When I first came up here...

37:25.808 --> 37:27.636
I was running.

37:30.117 --> 37:33.642
I was trying to pretend
like everything was okay.

37:38.821 --> 37:40.867
But it's not.

37:49.092 --> 37:51.573
I've had this thing...

37:53.009 --> 37:55.664
hanging over me for months.

37:58.928 --> 38:01.540
And I thought I was handling it.

38:07.067 --> 38:10.853
I just wanted everything
to be okay.

38:23.475 --> 38:25.781
- I heard what happened.
Are you okay?

38:25.825 --> 38:28.131
- Yeah, it was intense.

38:28.175 --> 38:30.873
But I kept my head on.

38:30.917 --> 38:33.006
And my crew's safe.

38:33.049 --> 38:35.530
- I guess you were
ready to come back.

38:35.574 --> 38:39.099
Maybe I was too hard on you--
- Lex. What happened today, I...

38:40.405 --> 38:42.668
I know what it feels like
to be trapped in a plane

38:42.711 --> 38:44.539
with someone dangerous
and unpredictable.

38:44.583 --> 38:46.759
I know how you must
have felt when I...

38:48.151 --> 38:50.850
It was wrong of me to ask you
to keep that secret.

38:50.893 --> 38:52.982
I was thinking of myself.

38:53.026 --> 38:54.854
Could have hurt somebody.
- Hold up.

38:54.897 --> 38:57.726
There's a big difference
between a wobbly Nowak

38:57.770 --> 39:00.120
and a patient trying
to crash a plane.

39:00.163 --> 39:01.991
You get that, right?

39:02.035 --> 39:04.472
But I'm glad you got help.

39:04.516 --> 39:06.474
And you get why
I couldn't lie for you.

39:06.518 --> 39:09.390
- You're the last person
I'd ever want to hurt, Lex.

39:09.434 --> 39:11.392
- I guess you're stuck with me,
cheekbones.

39:15.178 --> 39:17.485

39:35.503 --> 39:37.375
They want to interview me again.

39:38.985 --> 39:41.030
- It's your dream.

39:41.074 --> 39:43.206
Baby and I will be
okay on our own.

39:43.250 --> 39:44.730
- I turned it down.

39:47.123 --> 39:50.170
- Bodie, I don't need
you to do that for me.

39:50.213 --> 39:52.433
We're not going to be together.

39:52.477 --> 39:54.827
- I'm right where I need to be.

39:56.045 --> 39:57.438
Madison,

39:57.482 --> 39:59.701
you deserve someone that's gonna
give you everything,

39:59.745 --> 40:02.269
and I'm just sorry
I was too messed up

40:02.312 --> 40:03.531
to be that person.

40:03.575 --> 40:06.099
But I wanna be a dad.

40:07.405 --> 40:09.232
More than anything.

40:09.276 --> 40:10.712
So...

40:10.756 --> 40:13.976
maybe we can parent together.

40:14.020 --> 40:18.633
Even if we're not together.

was still in the hospital.
