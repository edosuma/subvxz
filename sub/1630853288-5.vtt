WEBVTT

00:11.886 --> 00:13.263
That was Jenkins, though.

00:16.932 --> 00:19.394
He just didn't care
if he saw another sunrise.

00:22.771 --> 00:26.860
Okay. Let's shift back over to you.
You... You joined the force...

00:26.942 --> 00:29.027
'05. Started in the Northwest.

00:29.570 --> 00:33.324
And you told us that
you were doing small robberies,

00:33.407 --> 00:35.285
places like Belvedere Towers back then.

00:36.869 --> 00:38.704
That was around '08.

00:39.205 --> 00:42.333
And, just laying into some people,
like I said. Not any big stuff.

00:42.833 --> 00:44.501
If I may, you...

00:45.627 --> 00:48.506
sustained a gunshot wound in 2006.
What was that about?

00:50.258 --> 00:54.970
I caught a hot one when some dude
tried to rob me and he got shot.

00:59.516 --> 01:02.227
It's in the reports. You said that...
I'm sure you got all that.

01:02.311 --> 01:05.231
Actually, we have conflicting info
on that incident.

01:05.731 --> 01:06.941
Conflicting?

01:07.274 --> 01:11.863
One source indicated that
that shooting was actually drug related.

01:12.739 --> 01:16.159
A retaliation for some trafficking
you were involved with.

01:17.952 --> 01:20.746
Who told you that, Rayam?

01:22.499 --> 01:23.458
Shoot. It's...

01:24.791 --> 01:26.544
Jemell just trying to shine
the teacher's apple

01:26.627 --> 01:28.379
if he's laying stuff like that off on me.

01:28.463 --> 01:30.672
I mean, that ain't even credible.
What is... what is that?

01:32.299 --> 01:34.552
I mean, he's my boy,
but he always had his own problems.

01:34.886 --> 01:37.221
-What kind of problems?
-He likes women, for one.

01:38.347 --> 01:40.892
I'm just saying,
this man sets his watch to pussy.

01:44.645 --> 01:45.730
Excuse me, Miss Jensen.

01:52.237 --> 01:55.573
This shit goes way back
to when he was in uniform.

02:11.506 --> 02:14.132
He was lined up
with the underworld from the beginning.

02:15.343 --> 02:16.927
Jemell was married but, you know,

02:17.011 --> 02:19.055
-he had this girlfriend, Crystal Ferguson.
-What's up?

02:20.431 --> 02:22.432
You want... You want me to...
All right. See ya.

02:28.855 --> 02:31.317
She knew all the players west of M.L.K.

02:31.400 --> 02:33.570
When they'd be at their cribs,
when they wouldn't.

02:35.404 --> 02:37.197
She'd tell Jemell when they could be got.

02:41.578 --> 02:44.122
Fucking G-Money said that shit?

02:45.290 --> 02:49.460
Oh, wow. That's fucking funny.
He... he's acting like he's all pure now.

02:49.543 --> 02:50.670
Okay.

02:50.752 --> 02:52.922
-This fucking guy.
-Did Crystal Ferguson

02:53.005 --> 02:54.674
provide you with robbery targets?

03:00.137 --> 03:03.057
She mighta. I don't recall, exactly.

03:03.140 --> 03:04.684
This was when you and Detective Gondo

03:04.766 --> 03:06.685
were on the Violent Crime Impact Division
together?

03:07.520 --> 03:11.191
No. We went there later on.
And we weren't on VCID together.

03:12.065 --> 03:14.151
But we were doing our thing, for sure.

03:14.860 --> 03:15.944
But separate.

03:16.361 --> 03:19.532
In 2009, you fatally shot a citizen,
Shawn Cannady,

03:19.615 --> 03:21.075
in an alley off Pimlico Road.

03:24.536 --> 03:25.496
Self-defense.

03:26.247 --> 03:29.417
Uh-uh. No, no, not just the one.

03:30.500 --> 03:33.170
No, Jemell shot three people that year.

03:34.421 --> 03:35.422
Three.

03:35.840 --> 03:37.884
Get out of the car.
Get out of the car, now!

03:41.094 --> 03:43.472
Now, Rayam told me he did the thing.
I mean...

03:45.058 --> 03:46.141
he never denied it.

03:47.393 --> 03:51.104
Made it like the driver of a Lexus
was using his vehicle as a weapon,

03:51.773 --> 03:54.191
claimed the Lex had clipped Giordano.

03:54.734 --> 03:56.194
Jemell got off on that one.

03:58.403 --> 04:02.366
Palmere was right there on the scene,
coaching my man.

04:03.575 --> 04:06.329
Palmere, the deputy commissioner?

04:06.663 --> 04:09.665
Yeah. Colonel back then, but yeah.

You felt that your life was in danger.
Got it?

04:51.915 --> 04:53.875
The Cannady shooting was justified.

04:56.420 --> 04:58.630
And you were subsequently suspended
for two years.

04:58.715 --> 05:01.758
Yeah, while they investigated
the thug from the Gary Brown stop.

05:03.094 --> 05:05.470
You lied to IAD investigators
regarding that one.

05:06.847 --> 05:09.641
-Right.
-Suspended with pay.

05:11.227 --> 05:13.353
I guess, you could say I was in limbo.
Yeah.

05:15.355 --> 05:19.819
And when you came off suspension
in 2012...

05:20.695 --> 05:23.948
Yeah. I went to the Gun Trace Task Force.

05:28.535 --> 05:30.788
What am I paying you
500 dollars an hour for?

No justice, no peace!

06:14.664 --> 06:16.875
I've heard your calls
for no justice, no peace.

MONDAY

06:47.322 --> 06:48.949
Where there's smoke, there's fire.

06:49.784 --> 06:53.119
These officers, they're 1930s-style
gangsters.

06:53.621 --> 06:57.165
WE OWN THIS CITY

07:02.422 --> 07:06.050
Detective Gondo,
you joined the GTTF 2010.

07:06.509 --> 07:07.717
Two years before Rayam.

07:08.344 --> 07:10.221
He got bounced around
for a couple of years.

07:10.304 --> 07:12.765
He was battling
an Internal Affairs investigation.

07:13.181 --> 07:17.561
Before Rayam joined the GTTF,
what was going on within the squad?

07:18.771 --> 07:22.983
Nothing inappropriate.
Nothing criminal. Not really.

07:23.817 --> 07:26.736
And then after he came back
from his suspension and rejoined?

07:28.321 --> 07:29.991
I mean, this shit
just seemed to go downhill.

07:35.580 --> 07:36.831
That's all for now.

07:48.217 --> 07:49.469
All right, man, come on.

07:55.725 --> 07:59.728
Gondo doesn't have a problem
talking about a guy he says was his boy.

08:00.146 --> 08:01.272
Some friend.

08:02.356 --> 08:05.818
Man, it's hard to believe
Rayam has all those shootings,

08:05.902 --> 08:09.405
lies to the investigators,
gets caught on those lies, and...

08:10.405 --> 08:13.033
and when he comes off suspension,
they reward him

08:13.117 --> 08:15.702
by dropping him
in one of the most elite squads

08:15.786 --> 08:16.913
in the BPD.

08:18.539 --> 08:19.998
Cream rises to the top.

08:23.336 --> 08:27.006

08:27.088 --> 08:30.216
TWELVE MONTHS EARLIER

08:30.300 --> 08:34.055
Copy, turning 11 around.
Fifteen blocks away. Can I get a...

08:34.471 --> 08:35.430
No ID?

08:36.265 --> 08:37.350
Nothing on him.

08:38.558 --> 08:40.311
Rigor says he's been there a while.

08:42.104 --> 08:43.730
I'll start knocking on doors.

08:51.071 --> 08:52.031
You all right?

08:55.992 --> 08:58.538
Just a moment of your time. All right?
That's all I need.

09:04.502 --> 09:07.045
How you doin' today, sir?
Detective Sean Suiter.

09:08.088 --> 09:10.383
-You are?
-I'm not inclined to give my name.

09:11.466 --> 09:12.676
Do you live around here?

09:12.760 --> 09:14.679
I stay up on Bond, near Preston.

09:14.761 --> 09:17.514
I was wondering if you saw or heard
anything related to this,

09:17.889 --> 09:19.057
probably last night.

09:21.060 --> 09:22.727
By any chance,
do you recognize the victim?

09:22.811 --> 09:25.648
Look, let me be straight with you,
Detective, to save you some time.

09:26.566 --> 09:27.649
I don't talk to police.

09:28.024 --> 09:30.570
-I'm Homicide.
-Make no difference to me.

09:31.277 --> 09:32.822
Ain't nobody born Homicide.

09:33.655 --> 09:35.408
Were you one of those jump-out boys?

09:36.826 --> 09:38.618
I did that for a while, yes.

09:38.703 --> 09:42.206
Some of y'all rob people.
Hell, I got robbed my damn self.

09:43.874 --> 09:45.000
Look, nothing personal.

09:45.084 --> 09:47.295
But I've been living in Baltimore
all my life.

09:48.087 --> 09:50.338
I know. I know.

09:51.131 --> 09:52.091
Just a moment.

09:54.259 --> 09:58.138
Something comes to you... please call.

10:05.353 --> 10:08.149
Hey, Sean. These houses are vacant here.

10:08.606 --> 10:09.858
So what else we got, Charlie?

10:09.942 --> 10:10.985
What do you want?

10:11.067 --> 10:13.195
I got Fourth Amendment violations,
warrantless searches...

10:13.278 --> 10:15.488
You know what people are gonna say
out in the suburbs?

10:15.573 --> 10:18.491
Hell, you know what half the country
would say if they were to read this stuff?

10:19.327 --> 10:22.330
"They might not have been guilty of
something on the day they got pulled over

10:22.412 --> 10:24.915
or jacked up, but they damn sure
were guilty of something."

10:25.458 --> 10:26.416
So?

10:26.958 --> 10:30.129
So I'm saying,
in the minds of Wonder Bread Americans,

10:30.211 --> 10:32.547
these people aren't really victims.
They deserved it.

10:33.549 --> 10:35.175
Ahmed's right about the optics.

10:35.592 --> 10:38.596
Look, we dug up instances
where Baltimore police came down on people

10:38.678 --> 10:40.723
who weren't drug dealers,
who weren't doing anything dirty.

10:41.098 --> 10:43.141
These folks had no previous charges
whatsoever

10:43.476 --> 10:46.144
outside of simple marijuana possession
or traffic violations.

10:46.562 --> 10:49.065
I've got claims that cops
flat-out robbed straight citizens.

10:49.857 --> 10:51.733
Hold on. Let's see...

10:53.568 --> 10:54.694
Here it is.

10:55.696 --> 10:58.157
Guy's name is James Otis.
You should talk to him.

10:58.239 --> 10:59.742
He ran afoul of a guy we know and love.

11:00.742 --> 11:04.580
Our old friend. All right.
I'll go and talk to him.

11:05.206 --> 11:08.041
We have a little time to add
the finishing touches to the decree.

11:17.926 --> 11:19.094
There's Gondo.

11:21.846 --> 11:24.432
Be advised,
the subject has gone to ground.

11:26.852 --> 11:29.145
We'll wait to be sure he's in
for the night, then move.

11:30.356 --> 11:31.315
Copy that.

11:41.491 --> 11:42.618
Okay.

11:42.700 --> 11:45.371
Hey, I can do this for you.

11:46.288 --> 11:47.581
You can do this for me?

11:48.164 --> 11:49.749
I mean, you know, in case...

11:50.584 --> 11:51.752
In case what?

11:51.835 --> 11:53.421
I'm just saying. You know,
I mean, it's dark,

11:53.503 --> 11:55.798
-you're crawling around in there.
-It's dark and I can't find my way

11:55.880 --> 11:57.799
around the interior of a Chevrolet?

12:00.927 --> 12:02.387
I guess that didn't sound right.

12:03.429 --> 12:04.890
How did you want it to sound?

12:04.973 --> 12:07.475
Like a middle-aged White guy from 1974.

12:07.559 --> 12:09.186
No, you pretty much nailed that.

12:10.562 --> 12:11.604
We are a go.

12:11.689 --> 12:13.649
Copy that. We see her on the move.

12:15.234 --> 12:16.734
Come on, come on, come on.

12:33.169 --> 12:34.460
Testing. Can you hear me?

12:40.509 --> 12:41.677
Okay.

12:41.759 --> 12:42.802
She's out.

12:42.886 --> 12:44.305
Copy. We hear it.

12:44.805 --> 12:47.182
Picked you up as soon as you got in.
Clear as a bell.

12:47.266 --> 12:49.977
Sound activated.
So as soon as you open that door,

12:50.059 --> 12:51.061
it kicked in.

12:52.062 --> 12:54.148
Okay, we're set. All clear.

12:54.772 --> 12:58.693
Oh, man. Oh, no.
I think I messed my hair up.

12:59.444 --> 13:02.364
-Oh, Johnny, how's my hair look?
-Okay. Enough. Thank you.

13:07.660 --> 13:11.831
No casings anywhere around the body.
Could be he got done with a revolver.

13:12.624 --> 13:14.209
Or the casings got picked up.

13:16.212 --> 13:17.212
Well...

13:19.380 --> 13:20.840
Autopsy will tell us tomorrow.

13:21.341 --> 13:23.260
We're not gonna get much help
from the residents.

13:25.095 --> 13:27.681
Man you spoke to earlier
was rough on you, huh?

13:28.349 --> 13:31.100
Well, he's right about some things.
He had his truth.

13:32.060 --> 13:34.063
I had my path. I took it to get here.

13:36.356 --> 13:37.398
I like what I'm doing now.

13:37.942 --> 13:40.444
I'm not gonna get all dramatic about it,
say it's my calling.

13:40.526 --> 13:45.073
But being in Homicide,
doing this kind of work, it feels right.

13:47.659 --> 13:50.746
But working drugs,
that wasn't my finest hour.

13:51.955 --> 13:55.500
I mean, that shit was pointless, really.

13:56.960 --> 13:58.546
And I saw some things.

14:09.807 --> 14:11.266
That was a long time ago.

14:16.229 --> 14:18.399
You want another? I'm buying.

14:19.525 --> 14:21.902
In that case, let me get something
off the top shelf.

14:41.297 --> 14:42.631
-James Otis?
-That's right.

14:42.714 --> 14:45.342
Nicole Steele, DOJ. Thank you.

14:49.053 --> 14:50.221
It's quiet in here.

14:50.556 --> 14:52.473
We got three kids, so that's unusual.

14:53.349 --> 14:55.936
Two of 'em are in school today.
And my wife took the youngest one out

14:56.020 --> 14:57.020
so we could talk.

14:58.313 --> 14:59.605
Are you currently employed?

15:00.273 --> 15:03.526
Not currently.
I was a HVAC repairman, you know,

15:03.611 --> 15:05.778
heating and air? I'll get to that.

15:06.572 --> 15:07.739
Tell me about the incident.

15:10.033 --> 15:11.535
You mean, when I got pulled over.

15:13.703 --> 15:15.873
I had just grabbed some pizza for me
and my family,

15:15.956 --> 15:17.833
at that Ledo's they got behind Hopkins.

15:22.504 --> 15:25.132
And I was headed home
on a street off of North Avenue,

15:25.965 --> 15:27.593
near Green Mount Cemetery.

15:29.344 --> 15:30.887
It was Hersl and two others.

15:30.971 --> 15:33.223
And this wasn't the first time
I got stopped by Officer Hersl.

15:33.682 --> 15:37.770
He had a thing about my car, I guess.
Anyway, they said my taillight was out.

15:38.102 --> 15:39.188
Was it?

15:39.270 --> 15:42.148
Yeah, it was. I got this classic car,

15:42.523 --> 15:44.567
an Impala SS. I bought on time.

15:44.984 --> 15:48.030
I knew my light was out,
but I was waiting on the bulb to come in.

15:48.488 --> 15:50.282
Not easy to get parts on older cars.

15:51.491 --> 15:54.036
Homer Avenue. Still in Lower Park Heights?

15:54.828 --> 15:56.079
That's a nice neighborhood.

15:56.163 --> 15:57.957
If you're gonna give me a citation
for that taillight,

15:58.039 --> 15:59.792
give me one.
I'm trying to get home to my family.

16:01.210 --> 16:04.003
Oh, you see that?
Assaulting a police officer. Cuff his ass.

16:04.338 --> 16:05.798
Motherfucker.

16:05.881 --> 16:06.881
What'd you say?

16:07.591 --> 16:12.137
Oh, shit. You know what? That reminds me,
I almost forgot to search your vehicle.

16:13.930 --> 16:15.515
Man, you got no cause for that.

16:15.598 --> 16:16.557
Yes, I do.

16:21.522 --> 16:24.482
Could it be that sweet, sickening smell?

16:24.566 --> 16:26.610
You know, the one they told us about
in middle school?

16:26.692 --> 16:28.696
Middle school about as far
as you got, too.

16:28.778 --> 16:31.073
-Yeah, keep talking.
-Sit down, asshole.

16:32.616 --> 16:33.741
Had you been smoking weed?

16:34.367 --> 16:36.954
I mean, everybody got that smell
on them these days.

16:37.454 --> 16:39.123
You catch it just walking down the street.

16:39.997 --> 16:42.583
Cops use that as an excuse
to toss your car all the time.

16:43.085 --> 16:44.168
Okay. What happened next?

16:44.628 --> 16:45.753
Hersl robbed me.

16:48.214 --> 16:50.925
I had just cashed my paycheck
at the M-and-T on Fayette.

16:52.928 --> 16:54.345
Six hundred and fifty-eight dollars.

16:56.806 --> 17:00.644
All right, come on. On your feet.
Let's go, up, up, up.

17:01.727 --> 17:04.856
You take my money?
You take my money, Hersl?

17:04.940 --> 17:06.275
You ain't right, man.

17:06.358 --> 17:07.818
-That's some bullshit.
-Get up there, let's go.

17:12.740 --> 17:15.450
I was jail side for two days
before anyone got to me.

17:16.325 --> 17:17.327
Otis.

17:21.164 --> 17:22.916
Never even spoke to a public defender.

17:23.416 --> 17:25.877
A state prosecutor they had there
interviewed me,

17:25.961 --> 17:28.922
and when I told him what happened,
he had me sign a form

17:29.005 --> 17:31.175
that waived my right
to sue the city for false arrest,

17:31.591 --> 17:34.051
in exchange for them throwing out
the charges on the spot.

17:34.760 --> 17:36.846
They knew what they had on me
was bullshit and wouldn't stick.

17:37.765 --> 17:40.057
So it never went to court.
That's a good thing, right?

17:40.142 --> 17:41.310
Let me finish.

17:41.392 --> 17:42.685
Come on, man. Give me a break.

17:42.770 --> 17:44.896
-On account of the days I was locked up...
-I got a family.

17:44.980 --> 17:47.316
...my calls went unserviced,
and we lost a couple customers.

17:47.398 --> 17:49.358
-Sorry, James.
-My employer told me he had to let me go.

17:49.443 --> 17:50.736
You had no recourse?

17:50.819 --> 17:52.905
I already signed away
my right to a lawsuit,

17:53.321 --> 17:54.363
I told you that.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.908
But I did file a complaint, on principle.

17:59.119 --> 18:00.496
Did you get your money back, at least?

18:01.705 --> 18:04.041
Shit. Of the 658 dollars he took?

18:04.666 --> 18:07.002
Hersl submitted 50 to Evidence Control.

18:08.419 --> 18:10.672
-He pocketed the rest.
-You surprised?

18:14.510 --> 18:16.010
He probably drank my money away.

18:21.140 --> 18:22.225
Hell yeah.

18:22.643 --> 18:25.521
-About to take all your money.
-Or had himself a good old time with it.

18:26.938 --> 18:27.980
Let's see what you got.

18:28.315 --> 18:29.273
Goddamn!

18:29.858 --> 18:31.151
Some shit like that.

18:31.235 --> 18:33.529
Come on. I'll spot ya, I'll spot ya.
Come on.

18:33.612 --> 18:34.571
It was nothing to him.

18:35.738 --> 18:36.740
-Later.
-You go ahead.

18:37.281 --> 18:39.576
That money meant something to me.
I earned it.

18:40.077 --> 18:42.621
My wife and me,
we got no cushion, for real.

18:43.329 --> 18:46.666
When I cash my paycheck,
every penny goes to my mortgage,

18:47.126 --> 18:49.043
groceries, stuff for my kids.

18:49.835 --> 18:52.755
This set me back.
Bank's about to repo my car.

18:53.506 --> 18:56.468
If I do get a job now,
how am I supposed to get to work?

18:57.511 --> 18:59.971
Everyone who lives here
knows what time it is.

19:00.054 --> 19:04.017
Police treating all of us like criminals,
people like me, my family.

19:13.694 --> 19:18.115
Detective Rayam, your partner, Gondo,
says that when you joined GTTF,

19:18.197 --> 19:21.367
things, in his words,
"Began to go downhill."

19:22.619 --> 19:24.787
Yo, Gondo was in the mix from the start.

19:24.872 --> 19:27.541
All right? It wasn't me who cultivated
a relationship with Brill.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.709
You mean, Antonio Shropshire.

19:30.042 --> 19:31.002
Right.

19:31.586 --> 19:34.798
That goes back to when they were kids,
long before Gondo knew me.

19:36.175 --> 19:38.843
And honestly, neither one of us
supervised the squad.

19:39.469 --> 19:40.636
We just followed the leader.

19:41.178 --> 19:42.555
You're talking about Wayne Jenkins?

19:43.014 --> 19:45.349
And Allers before him, too. Shit.

19:46.268 --> 19:47.476
Oh, fuck. You know...

19:48.477 --> 19:50.021
There was this...

19:51.856 --> 19:54.233
one robbery back in...

19:55.318 --> 19:56.569
2014.

19:57.279 --> 19:59.823
Allers got the tip from a CI
he'd been working with.

20:00.448 --> 20:02.910
Out in West Edmondale?

20:03.409 --> 20:07.080
That's it. Fifty-four-54.
One with the white bars on the door.

20:07.664 --> 20:09.791
Sergeant Allers brought his son
with us on that one.

20:10.333 --> 20:12.836
I reckon it was
a "Bring your Kid to Work Day."

20:14.003 --> 20:15.797
-Husband and wife team.
-Yes, sir.

20:16.256 --> 20:18.592
George Williams
and Yolanda Paige-Williams.

20:21.385 --> 20:23.971
G, this shit could be big, man.

20:24.056 --> 20:27.308
Yeah, seen his photo.
Bigger than a motherfucker.

20:28.351 --> 20:29.935
Are we gonna call
the county boys in on this?

20:30.478 --> 20:33.398
After we see what we got.
Come on, y'all ready to do this?

20:33.941 --> 20:35.234
-Let's go. You ready?
-Let's go, man.

20:35.317 --> 20:37.526
-Wake your ass us up, motherfucker.
-Let's go.

20:47.453 --> 20:48.996
All right, son, you fall back right here.

20:52.251 --> 20:53.668
-Police!
-What do you want?

20:54.253 --> 20:55.211
Police!

20:56.587 --> 20:58.089
-Stand back. Get down!
-Stand back, motherfucker.

20:58.548 --> 20:59.715
That house was hot.

21:00.634 --> 21:02.970
We cleaned the fuck up. Wife shit.

21:05.096 --> 21:07.973
Hey. Don't play with me.

21:12.645 --> 21:17.066
Seventy, 80, 90, 100.
Look at this shit, baby.

21:17.900 --> 21:19.527
That's a hundred grand right there.

21:19.611 --> 21:22.197
There was 416,000 dollars in that bedroom.

21:22.279 --> 21:25.199
-Forty, fifty, sixty, seventy...
-When the county police showed up,

21:25.284 --> 21:26.868
they found three-fifty.

21:27.202 --> 21:28.203
You believe this shit?

21:28.662 --> 21:31.790
-Shit. Stop playing with me.
-Detective Ward, when Wayne Jenkins

21:31.873 --> 21:35.334
took over the supervision
of the GTTF from Sergeant Allers,

21:36.669 --> 21:37.879
what was the biggest change?

21:39.131 --> 21:42.050
Well, I came after Allers,
but from what I heard,

21:42.675 --> 21:44.386
it wasn't like he didn't know
how to steal.

21:44.468 --> 21:48.180
It was just Jenks, man,
he... he was something else.

21:48.265 --> 21:49.223
Tell us.

21:51.393 --> 21:54.186
Well, you gotta remember,
it was like a new squad.

21:54.813 --> 21:57.983
Me, Taylor, Hendrix, and Jenkins
had just come on.

21:58.065 --> 22:02.070
And later on, Jenkins added this new kid,
Kost-o-please.

22:03.028 --> 22:04.613
James Kostoplis.

22:04.698 --> 22:05.656
K-Stop.

22:06.533 --> 22:09.619
Yeah, his people are
from one of them countries over there.

22:10.870 --> 22:13.498
But Jenkins knew him
from when he was a patrol sergeant

22:13.582 --> 22:15.750
in the Northeast.
K-Stop was in his squad over there.

22:17.961 --> 22:21.882
I make big money, I drive big cars
Everybody know me

22:21.965 --> 22:25.344
This kid adored Jenkins.
I mean, he really looked up to him.

22:25.926 --> 22:28.262
I feel I'm being tailed
By the same sucker's head lights

22:30.931 --> 22:34.852
And also when he came,
Jenkins told us new guys

22:34.936 --> 22:37.230
that Gondo and Rayam
were under federal investigation

22:37.314 --> 22:38.357
for selling drugs.

22:38.939 --> 22:41.651
Were Gondo and Rayam...
Did they seem concerned?

22:43.152 --> 22:44.863
Not really. I mean,

22:45.196 --> 22:47.823
when Jenks came in, everybody was excited
about the money.

22:48.407 --> 22:49.450
To be honest with you,

22:49.534 --> 22:51.119
nobody really thought too hard
on anything else.

22:51.202 --> 22:52.162
The money?

22:52.662 --> 22:53.621
The overtime pay.

22:55.290 --> 22:57.500
With Jenkins,
it was like we had permission

22:57.584 --> 22:58.584
to rob that fund.

22:58.960 --> 23:01.004
The faucet was on, full force.

23:02.589 --> 23:05.133
I don't know Jenkins. Not like you.

23:05.675 --> 23:07.260
All right.
Let me tell you how this boy be.

23:08.553 --> 23:12.182
He'll come in late every day.
So we don't come in till 10:00, 11:00.

23:13.349 --> 23:16.477
And depending on how he feel,
we might roll out on regular time.

23:17.729 --> 23:20.357
That's how he gets down, man.
We got that green light.

23:20.689 --> 23:24.610
Some supervisor told Jenks
the overtime budget is wide open.

23:25.195 --> 23:26.946
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-"Work as much as you want."

23:28.739 --> 23:29.699
Bet.

23:30.616 --> 23:33.787
Ain't no thing, man. You gonna like him,
you gonna like Jenks. Matter of fact...

23:35.997 --> 23:38.874
last night, Jenkins tells us
to put in slips

23:39.584 --> 23:42.837
for six OT hours.
We ain't even work a full shift.

23:43.755 --> 23:46.006
Then we banging... We like this.
Banging that OT, G.

23:46.091 --> 23:47.884
-Hey. Yeah, hit me with that.
-You know what I'm saying?

23:48.259 --> 23:49.844
-He cool.
-I'm with that.

23:51.136 --> 23:52.597
-Yeah.
-He crazy, but he cool.

23:53.598 --> 23:55.850
The summary reads like butter.

23:59.438 --> 24:00.480
Got it all done.

24:00.897 --> 24:03.358
Mayor Rawlings-Blake asked for it.
And she'll get her copy

24:03.440 --> 24:05.068
just in time for her to make her exit.

24:05.944 --> 24:09.072
"The Baltimore Police Department
engages in a practice

24:09.154 --> 24:11.532
or pattern of making
unconstitutional stops, searches,

24:11.616 --> 24:12.575
and arrests."

24:13.410 --> 24:15.579
Here we go. "Disparities in
the rates of stops,

24:15.661 --> 24:17.330
searches, and arrests
of African Americans,"

24:17.414 --> 24:20.374
and, "Driven by systemic deficiencies
of BPD policies, training,

24:20.459 --> 24:22.418
supervision,
and accountability structures."

24:22.501 --> 24:24.129
This is incendiary shit.

24:24.212 --> 24:26.298
I would hope so. But it's not a directive.

24:26.380 --> 24:28.257
We still have to get
the consent decree signed.

24:28.341 --> 24:29.550
-Right.
-So we drop that on Pugh

24:29.634 --> 24:32.386
-as soon as she puts on the crown.
-We moving pretty fast now.

24:32.471 --> 24:33.929
We gotta get the consent decree out there

24:34.014 --> 24:35.723
before the new administration comes in,
in January.

24:36.099 --> 24:37.434
Hilary's AG, whoever that is,

24:37.517 --> 24:39.643
should be a little bit sympathetic
to police reform.

24:40.728 --> 24:41.688
Assuming...

24:42.189 --> 24:43.773
How is your friend,
the police commissioner,

24:43.856 --> 24:44.940
gonna like this?

24:56.536 --> 24:57.620
Have you read this?

24:57.703 --> 24:59.496
-I read enough.
-We're doing our jobs.

24:59.581 --> 25:01.540
What do people want,
for us to stop policing?

25:02.124 --> 25:05.378
They want us to do it in a better way,
without the collateral damage.

25:05.461 --> 25:07.504
But how? How do you keep control
with this much violence

25:07.588 --> 25:08.547
without being aggressive?

25:09.841 --> 25:12.217
It doesn't help that shit like this
gets everyone all ginned up.

25:14.513 --> 25:17.807
These popped up all over the city.
Idiots misspelled "loiterers".

25:18.515 --> 25:19.600
It does make a point.

25:23.437 --> 25:24.439
Is that all?

25:31.320 --> 25:32.948
Hey, G, what up? What up?

25:33.031 --> 25:35.534
Look, Jemell, I know
Jenkins do some crazy shit.

25:35.617 --> 25:38.786
You don't gotta tell me.
You know, Jenks is code-motherfucking-red.

25:38.869 --> 25:42.916
All right, but look, this last paycheck
I just got from the city?

25:44.083 --> 25:46.126
Eight thousand dollars.

25:46.211 --> 25:49.464
When I looked at it, I was like,
"Oh, my God, who did this?"

25:50.339 --> 25:51.298
"This is a lie."

25:52.633 --> 25:56.303
Telling you, there's a method
to Jenkins' madness. He...

25:56.638 --> 25:59.139
Yeah. Yeah, that motherfucker
off the chain, G.

25:59.682 --> 26:00.892
Look, like I said,

26:01.351 --> 26:04.020
let's go at this shit hard.
Let's enjoy this shit while we can

26:04.103 --> 26:05.980
'cause all good things come to an end.

26:06.064 --> 26:07.065
For real.

26:07.815 --> 26:10.693
But Jenks,
man, he off the fucking chain, yo.

26:11.485 --> 26:13.487
He off the motherfucking chain, B.

26:13.570 --> 26:15.030
He off the fucking chain, B.

26:15.114 --> 26:17.116
I swear, that nigga off the chain, G.

26:19.869 --> 26:23.873
All this bogus overtime they're banking,
we'll get every one of 'em on wire fraud.

26:23.956 --> 26:26.126
Bring in the IRS
and we got tax evasion too.

26:26.209 --> 26:27.419
The old-fashioned way.

26:27.502 --> 26:29.254
I'm starting to love me
some Wayne Jenkins.

26:29.337 --> 26:30.547
He off the chain, yo.

26:33.841 --> 26:36.760
I read most of your book, Mr. Grabler.

26:36.845 --> 26:39.764
And sure enough,
you write about many of the same issues

26:39.847 --> 26:42.267
that we at the DOJ are trying to address.

26:42.350 --> 26:43.517
Thank you.

26:43.602 --> 26:47.438
You know, there's an old joke
that inside of every old cop is a book.

26:48.147 --> 26:50.150
And that's exactly where it should stay.

26:50.859 --> 26:53.110
Well, you certainly wrote from experience.

26:53.193 --> 26:55.572
Oh, I did. I did. I came on in '72.

26:57.198 --> 27:00.243
Walking foot up in the Northwest,
and then...

27:00.743 --> 27:05.372
plainclothes ops, after that, narcotics.
And I did my longest stint in Homicide.

27:05.706 --> 27:08.542
After my retirement, I ended up back here,
at the Academy, teaching.

27:08.627 --> 27:10.253
Sounds like a rewarding career.

27:10.335 --> 27:14.506
It was, it was.
I loved being a cop, you know.

27:14.591 --> 27:16.800
I loved it when the job meant something,
when you could...

27:17.552 --> 27:20.138
make an arrest for a street robbery,
or a rapist,

27:20.220 --> 27:22.347
or put down a murderer.
There was nothing finer.

27:22.724 --> 27:25.434
Nothing finer.
But people had to talk to you,

27:25.517 --> 27:27.103
and once upon a time, they did.

27:27.729 --> 27:31.231
Well, of course, not all of them.
There is a street code for snitching.

27:31.316 --> 27:32.901
But there were always

27:32.983 --> 27:35.402
enough people on the post
that would talk to you.

27:35.487 --> 27:36.987
That trust is broken.

27:37.072 --> 27:39.323
Yeah, well, you can't...
you can't get information out of somebody

27:39.407 --> 27:41.701
while you're beating on 'em,
or you got your hand in their pocket.

27:41.785 --> 27:44.162
-And then lying about it in court.
-Yeah.

27:44.953 --> 27:49.000
You know... everything changed
when they came up with that expression,

27:49.084 --> 27:50.751
"The War on Drugs."

27:51.543 --> 27:53.713
What an idiotic fucking thing to say.

27:54.589 --> 27:56.883
What the hell is a war on drugs?
What does that mean?

27:57.342 --> 27:59.761
Waging a war against citizens...

28:00.677 --> 28:03.555
by definition is separating us
into two opposing camps.

28:03.640 --> 28:05.641
The colonizer and the colonized.

28:06.433 --> 28:08.227
Albert Memmi, very good. Yes.

28:08.769 --> 28:10.897
And with the war
comes police militarization.

28:11.313 --> 28:14.191
SWAT teams, tactical squads,
stop-and-frisk,

28:14.525 --> 28:17.696
strip searches, a complete gutting
of the Fourth Amendment.

28:18.530 --> 28:21.700
And it's like we're, we're fighting
terrorists on foreign soil.

28:22.032 --> 28:24.868
And you can't just blame the cops.
We serve the politicians,

28:24.952 --> 28:28.789
who thrive on being tough on crime.

28:28.873 --> 28:30.041
Zero tolerance.

28:30.124 --> 28:34.503
Zero tolerance, quality of life arrests.
Having a beer on your own stoop.

28:35.045 --> 28:38.757
Loitering, spitting on the sidewalk,
existing.

28:39.800 --> 28:40.759
Existing.

28:42.512 --> 28:46.349
In 2005, I think it was,
when O'Malley was still mayor,

28:46.849 --> 28:51.896
they made 100,000 arrests,
most of them Black, most of them poor.

28:51.979 --> 28:56.733
That's almost one arrest
for every six Baltimoreans in one year.

28:56.818 --> 29:00.280
They jacked up people six, seven times,
maybe 12 times.

29:00.362 --> 29:03.825
And many of those arrests were illegal,
never made it to court.

29:04.199 --> 29:05.744
But they got their stats.

29:08.580 --> 29:09.705
What do you teach here?

29:10.747 --> 29:11.958
I teach the law

29:12.624 --> 29:14.586
to cadets who are
about to hit the streets.

29:14.668 --> 29:16.671
Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments.

29:17.296 --> 29:19.758
A cop can't uphold the law
unless he understands the law.

29:20.800 --> 29:23.678
I teach these young kids to be good,
honest cops.

29:25.095 --> 29:26.306
The rest is up to them.

29:27.222 --> 29:29.057
You've given a lot of thought to this.

29:29.600 --> 29:30.601
Yeah.

29:32.061 --> 29:33.897
I come off as angry sometimes.

29:36.232 --> 29:37.399
Aren't you angry?

29:43.948 --> 29:46.450
So at some point, Jenkins told you
that you were under investigation?

29:47.492 --> 29:50.454
We knew. By that time...

29:51.163 --> 29:52.748
we had a sense y'all was on us.

29:53.625 --> 29:56.211
There wasn't no charade about the fact
Jenkins was in the shit, too.

29:57.629 --> 30:00.005
There was this one night
where we pulled over a suspect,

30:00.505 --> 30:01.966
then followed him to his house.

30:02.842 --> 30:05.178
Took him off
for like a pound of marijuana to sell.

30:06.011 --> 30:07.304
Jenkins told me to off it.

30:08.556 --> 30:09.681
Did you?

30:09.766 --> 30:12.517
No. I had Gondo sell it
through his friend, Glen Wells.

30:13.018 --> 30:15.021
Yeah, but you must have had
your own connect

30:15.103 --> 30:17.231
to sell the drugs
that you've been confiscating.

30:17.315 --> 30:19.066
That was my boy up in Philadelphia.

30:19.150 --> 30:20.317
Let's come back to that.

30:20.400 --> 30:24.614
On July 15 of 2016, you and other GTTF,

30:25.156 --> 30:28.158
detained a Ronald and Nancy Hamilton.

30:30.203 --> 30:32.579
Oh, shit. Y'all remember that?

30:33.413 --> 30:35.249
The f... That's fuckin' impressive.

30:35.333 --> 30:37.626
We have you and Gondo on tape,
discussing it.

30:39.169 --> 30:40.338
Right.

30:40.420 --> 30:44.801
Well, yeah, we got the tip on Hamilton
from a sergeant in the Southwestern.

30:45.260 --> 30:47.679
We got a warrant from a judge.
I put a tracker on the car.

30:48.179 --> 30:50.431
He had a big old house out
in Carroll County with a pool.

30:50.515 --> 30:52.892
Motherfucker was a monster. Shit.

30:52.975 --> 30:54.268
You had authority for the tracker?

30:54.352 --> 30:56.229
Hell, no. Did that on my own.

30:56.812 --> 30:59.107
Anyway, after we decided to do,
you know, the thing,

30:59.481 --> 31:01.985
we followed the Hamiltons
to Reisterstown Road.

31:02.067 --> 31:03.570
-Where's your money at, Hoss?
-Jacked 'em up.

31:03.652 --> 31:04.779
Let's see what you got here.

31:04.863 --> 31:07.322
Is that a cellphone?
Now, where that money at?

31:08.408 --> 31:10.535
I found a roll of cash on Hamilton
right there.

31:10.618 --> 31:13.036
Put your hands down. Go over there.
Yo, go over there.

31:13.121 --> 31:15.664
Shit had to be drug money,
so I knew we had the right dude.

31:15.748 --> 31:16.915
Don't talk to her.

31:16.999 --> 31:18.167
Sergeant Jenkins there?

31:18.250 --> 31:20.085
No. He was at the barn.

31:20.877 --> 31:22.629
You see, the plan was to bring them there,

31:22.963 --> 31:25.133
and then to introduce Jenks
as a US Attorney.

31:27.134 --> 31:30.638
Oh, shit, fucking Jenkins
as a US Attorney.

31:31.013 --> 31:34.601
Oh, no offense intended there.

31:36.686 --> 31:40.105
Sir, I can see from your file here
that you are a smart individual

31:40.188 --> 31:41.858
and as a federal prosecutor,

31:41.940 --> 31:44.776
I have been dealing
with these kinda cases for quite a while,

31:45.360 --> 31:46.988
I'm just gonna tell you, full candor,

31:47.071 --> 31:49.573
Mr. Hamilton, you are looking
at a serious amount of years

31:49.657 --> 31:51.408
unless you start giving us
the right answers.

31:51.908 --> 31:54.453
Now, look, we have you
on three separate controlled buys.

31:54.536 --> 31:56.372
-Now, we...
-Man, get the fuck out of here.

31:56.456 --> 31:59.792
Okay, first off, I'm not "man," okay?
So, let's just do that again.

32:00.167 --> 32:03.713
-I'm a US Attorney, okay?
-Whatever. And I don't sell no drugs.

32:04.255 --> 32:05.380
Man, what are you doing?

32:06.591 --> 32:08.426
You have
multiple federal drug convictions.

32:08.508 --> 32:10.470
You did six years
because of those convictions.

32:10.553 --> 32:11.596
This says that right there.

32:11.678 --> 32:13.805
What do you think you gonna do?
You think you gonna outsmart me?

32:13.890 --> 32:15.349
Now, let's try this shit again.

32:15.934 --> 32:18.685
You currently own this home in...
in Westminster, correct?

32:19.854 --> 32:22.147
Do you currently have quantities of drugs
at that home?

32:28.070 --> 32:30.573
-Man, he don't like talking much, huh?
-No.

32:30.655 --> 32:32.574
I'm sorry, you're... you're hearing
what I'm saying, right?

32:32.659 --> 32:35.452
-I'm hearing you perfectly fucking clear.
-Am I not talking loud enough? What is it?

32:35.536 --> 32:36.788
You want me to be slower?

32:36.871 --> 32:39.248
-What is it? Is it... is it pronunciation?
-No, I heard you just fine.

32:39.331 --> 32:41.458
-What do you fuckin' think the deal is?
-Yeah. I heard you good.

32:41.542 --> 32:45.713
Do you currently have quantities of drugs
at your home in Westminster?

32:51.386 --> 32:54.679
Well, shit. Guess we're just gonna
have to go out there and find out.

32:57.642 --> 32:59.393
Hamilton's house was nice.

33:04.190 --> 33:05.690
Boom! Yahtzee.

33:06.234 --> 33:07.902
Hey, yo!

33:08.819 --> 33:09.778
I see money.

33:10.238 --> 33:11.655
-Come on.
-Bump that shit.

33:11.739 --> 33:13.490
-Hersl and Gondo found money.
-Into it.

33:13.949 --> 33:16.326
-But no drugs.
-Look at that. All right, man.

33:16.411 --> 33:17.869
-Yep!
-Hell, yeah!

33:17.953 --> 33:21.081
He left Hersl in the room,
which was a mistake.

33:21.748 --> 33:24.876
We were downstairs,
waiting on the State Police to arrive.

33:25.460 --> 33:28.131
Fifty K. Where the rest of it at?

33:30.591 --> 33:31.716
How you gonna take my money?

33:32.343 --> 33:34.886
I earned that gambling,
selling cars I get at auctions.

33:34.971 --> 33:36.597
We're seizing this under forfeiture laws.

33:36.680 --> 33:38.432
You'll have a chance
to account for it later.

33:38.515 --> 33:39.558
That's some bullshit.

33:40.308 --> 33:42.978
Appreciate it, fellas.
You all get home safe, all right?

33:44.271 --> 33:45.230
You left after that?

33:47.525 --> 33:48.568
Jenkins wasn't done.

33:49.901 --> 33:51.654
Man, this a nice ass crib, man.

33:52.905 --> 33:57.784
I tell you. Is that what you call it?
It's your crib, hmm?

33:58.827 --> 34:03.290
Goddamn. This was a long-ass drive, man,
so we gonna need something.

34:05.710 --> 34:07.295
Come on, man. Where the drugs at, man?

34:08.796 --> 34:10.046
What, you got one of those safes?

34:10.131 --> 34:12.759
-Ain't no fucking drugs.
-Okay, but you do know people, right?

34:13.509 --> 34:15.386
You know drug dealers.
Where's your plug, man?

34:15.469 --> 34:17.554
I know you know somebody.
Give us a name, baby.

34:18.723 --> 34:20.140
Look, here's the bottom line.

34:20.558 --> 34:22.767
You take care of us,
we're gonna take care of you,

34:22.851 --> 34:26.814
'cause here's the crazy part...
One morning, you could wake up

34:27.814 --> 34:29.484
with ten kilos in the backyard.

34:32.528 --> 34:34.113
You split up the Hamilton money?

34:34.571 --> 34:36.615
Yeah, later that night at a bar.

34:38.241 --> 34:41.412
When Gondo went back to the bedroom
for the cash, there was the 50,

34:42.120 --> 34:45.625
then there was the loose 20,000.
I mean, I had counted more.

34:46.084 --> 34:50.088
You know, Hersl must have taken
a few thousand when he was up there alone.

34:51.047 --> 34:54.217
Of course, I lifted the 3,500
off of Hamilton when we pulled him over.

34:54.299 --> 34:58.053
That... What I'm sayin' is,
we weren't just stealing, all right?

34:58.512 --> 34:59.722
We were stealing from each other.

35:01.640 --> 35:04.852
Jenkins more than most, though.
At that point in time,

35:05.852 --> 35:07.814
we was all in it for ourselves,
to be honest.

35:08.647 --> 35:12.693
But all this while you knew
we were looking at you.

35:13.444 --> 35:15.695
You knew there was a federal
investigation.

35:20.408 --> 35:23.286
Oh, my God. Keisha. Last night.

35:24.664 --> 35:26.915
This girl got a big old ass.

35:27.834 --> 35:31.044
I call her Bonanza, 'cause she got them
wide open spaces.

35:32.420 --> 35:33.755
What the fuck is Bonanza?

35:33.840 --> 35:36.384
Like some show out west, B,
I don't know.

35:36.467 --> 35:37.927
My father used to watch that shit.

35:38.010 --> 35:42.640
Yeah, bet. Look, women gonna get you
in trouble.

35:44.015 --> 35:47.686
The females is just...
You know, who needs an extra complication?

35:48.855 --> 35:50.439
You know the big boys are looking at us.

35:51.065 --> 35:53.942
"Looking at us"? They looking at you.

35:54.026 --> 35:57.238
Jenks said that we was under
investigation, and you in particular...

35:57.946 --> 36:00.449
The way you be flashing money,
you could be the biggest drug dealer

36:00.532 --> 36:02.075
-in the whole goddamn department.
-Fuck you, man.

36:03.201 --> 36:04.537
-Look.
-That's some bullshit.

36:04.620 --> 36:05.663
Look, look,

36:05.745 --> 36:08.415
if it is the feds who are on this,
the case could go on for years.

36:08.498 --> 36:13.169
What case? This ain't no Pablo Escobar.
It's the police.

36:13.504 --> 36:15.672
I'm just saying, you doing a lot
of flashing of shit,

36:15.755 --> 36:17.882
-you know, like, silk...
-You finished, or you done?

36:17.967 --> 36:21.928
...silk robes. And you like the king
of Zamunda in Anne Arundel County.

36:22.012 --> 36:23.513
If you're gonna get it,
you gonna spend it.

36:23.597 --> 36:25.557
I mean, we in Baltimore.
It's not Houston, all right?

36:25.640 --> 36:29.769
All right, look here.
When the shit ends, it ends.

36:32.480 --> 36:33.858
In the meantime, we keep bangin'.

36:36.819 --> 36:39.154
Yeah. Guess we keep bangin', then.

36:42.700 --> 36:44.118
So, Detective, what you're saying,

36:44.202 --> 36:47.037
everyone in the squad
knew they were being investigated.

36:47.537 --> 36:49.832
The way Jenks put it,
Ryan Guinn had hipped him

36:49.916 --> 36:52.250
to the fact that y'all were looking into
Gondo and Rayam.

36:54.170 --> 36:57.632
Like, Guinn thought Jenkins was clean,
and he was just warning him

36:57.715 --> 36:58.883
about Gondo and Rayam.

36:59.675 --> 37:02.052
Still, into the fall of 2016,

37:02.135 --> 37:05.347
the GTTF continued to operate
as a rogue unit?

37:06.182 --> 37:07.600
Until Jenkins went on leave.

37:08.267 --> 37:11.478
And then Jenkins went on leave in October.

37:12.520 --> 37:13.730
Yeah, maternity.

37:14.105 --> 37:18.069
Paternity? His... his wife had a baby.

37:18.152 --> 37:20.112
Is Jenkins a family man?

37:21.697 --> 37:22.740
He said.

37:22.823 --> 37:25.743
You know, I mean we all went
to titty bars, and watched girls dance,

37:25.826 --> 37:26.953
and stuff, so...

37:27.036 --> 37:30.747
He had stayed married a long time.
He... he met his girl in high school.

37:30.830 --> 37:33.917
And they had a crib out in Middle River
where Wayne grew up.

37:34.335 --> 37:37.964
So, yeah, he took a couple months off
when they had their new kid.

37:39.172 --> 37:42.051
-Singing to him? He loves it.
-Bedtime. Yeah.

37:42.134 --> 37:43.594
He had a better day, huh?

37:43.678 --> 37:45.179
Yeah, we went for a walk and everything.

37:46.847 --> 37:48.182
-You gonna come next time?
-Yeah.

37:48.266 --> 37:49.683
Jenkins was a proud father.

37:51.435 --> 37:52.895
But he had his other life too.

37:55.064 --> 37:56.107
-Baby's down.
-Hey, baby.

37:56.190 --> 37:57.857
I guess I'll make dinner.

37:57.941 --> 37:59.735
You okay if we just
boil some pasta tonight?

38:00.068 --> 38:01.237
Baby, you so pretty.

38:01.320 --> 38:02.822
Yeah, gorgeous.

38:03.196 --> 38:05.408
You make whatever you want
as long as I get to kiss you later.

38:06.534 --> 38:07.909
You too. Downstairs. In twenty.

38:08.410 --> 38:10.370
-Love you, baby.
-Love you.

38:13.456 --> 38:14.750
You kiss my nose?

38:18.129 --> 38:20.673
Jenkins spent time down
in Harbor East on his own,

38:21.923 --> 38:23.801
at those fancy hotels there.

38:25.886 --> 38:28.347
He had money, so why not?

38:30.807 --> 38:31.850
Look at you, baby.

38:31.933 --> 38:34.145
He liked those big rooms
they had upstairs, too.

38:36.438 --> 38:38.148
He had this one chick on the regular.

38:39.566 --> 38:41.569
Jenkins never really
copped to it directly.

38:42.277 --> 38:44.946
You know what they say,
"If it's eatin', it ain't cheating."

38:46.115 --> 38:47.574
He wasn't a family man, exactly.

38:47.658 --> 38:48.616
Oh, fuck!

38:49.033 --> 38:49.993
-Get...
-More like...

38:50.369 --> 38:51.661
-Fuck. Come on.
-... just a man.

38:51.745 --> 38:53.039
Motherfuck...

38:59.795 --> 39:03.173
What happened with Officer Kostoplis?

39:03.673 --> 39:08.137
K-Stop. Jenkins was grooming that boy,

39:08.762 --> 39:11.640
but it didn't go the way he planned.

39:13.267 --> 39:14.226
Quiet tonight.

39:15.311 --> 39:16.812
This cold keeps the natives indoors.

39:17.521 --> 39:20.566
-Yeah.
-Tough to make money on a night like this.

39:23.860 --> 39:24.820
All right. Should be here.

39:26.571 --> 39:27.530
Cut the engine.

39:32.161 --> 39:33.162
Hey, K-Stop.

39:33.912 --> 39:35.997
Why don't you go on and leave your phone
in the van, all right?

39:43.671 --> 39:45.716
Don't worry, Danny's not gonna make out
with you, man.

39:52.680 --> 39:53.640
This is good.

39:56.644 --> 39:57.603
What's up?

40:00.522 --> 40:02.274
You've been doing a hell of a job, K-Stop.

40:02.982 --> 40:04.150
-Thank you.
-Yeah, man.

40:05.151 --> 40:06.110
I just...

40:06.529 --> 40:10.574
I guess, we wanna... yeah, we wanna run
a little... little hypothetical by you.

40:12.033 --> 40:14.619
-You know, like, a "What if?"
-Right?

40:16.120 --> 40:17.205
-Okay.
-Yeah.

40:18.289 --> 40:21.127
Say, we're on an investigation,
following a big-time drug dealer.

40:21.209 --> 40:22.460
A real fucking monster, right?

40:22.545 --> 40:25.880
We... Yeah, we get wind on
where he's keeping his cash.

40:25.964 --> 40:28.633
And then we actually come upon that cash.

40:29.927 --> 40:34.557
It's right there in front of us,
and we just... you know, we take it.

40:39.143 --> 40:40.396
What would you think about that?

40:47.611 --> 40:49.655
I think that's a terrible fucking idea.

40:51.030 --> 40:53.325
You can't have a badge on your chest,
do things like that.

40:53.409 --> 40:54.368
We don't do that shit.

40:57.871 --> 40:58.872
We don't.

41:08.007 --> 41:09.091
Hey, man.

41:09.173 --> 41:11.342
-Exactly the answer we're looking for.
-There you go. Come on.

41:11.426 --> 41:12.969
Good shit, K-Stop. I like it.

41:14.554 --> 41:15.513
All right.

41:22.980 --> 41:24.814
Let's get something to eat.
I wanna go to Matthew's.

41:25.149 --> 41:26.275
You always wanna go there, man.

41:26.983 --> 41:28.526
Yeah, 'cause it's fucking good.

41:28.610 --> 41:30.236
It wasn't too long after that,

41:30.321 --> 41:33.407
Wayne Jenkins transferred K-Stop
to a new squad.

41:35.742 --> 41:38.746
Jenkins forgot there was still
straight police on the job.

41:43.625 --> 41:44.585
K-Stop.

41:49.089 --> 41:52.008
-These are the attendees?
-According to the email we received.

41:52.508 --> 41:55.804
Andre Davis. I know this name,
from the Fourth Circuit.

41:55.888 --> 41:58.933
He's been a federal appeals court judge
going back to the Clinton years.

41:59.016 --> 42:01.476
Yeah, I hear that Pugh's gonna make him
city solicitor.

42:02.186 --> 42:04.813
Now, my impression is that he'll be
on our side.

42:05.314 --> 42:08.066
And the police commissioner,
he's gonna be an ally, too,

42:08.149 --> 42:09.233
for the most part.

42:09.985 --> 42:13.072
But the two that we have to look out for
are Tisha Edwards and Jim Smith.

42:13.739 --> 42:15.199
They both have Mayor Pugh's ear.

42:15.824 --> 42:16.909
We better get over there.

42:17.575 --> 42:20.371
All right. I'm ready.

42:21.788 --> 42:23.790
I'm sure you'll understand with all the
hustle and bustle

42:23.873 --> 42:25.375
in my first month in office,

42:25.458 --> 42:27.211
I have to study up
on this cassette decree.

42:28.503 --> 42:30.464
I've read it, of course,
but I wanna confer with my people

42:30.546 --> 42:31.673
about the details.

42:31.756 --> 42:34.258
We do understand,
and we appreciate your attention to this.

42:34.759 --> 42:37.345
But in light of the outcome
of the presidential election,

42:37.428 --> 42:40.974
and Trump's impending installation
of Jeff Sessions as attorney general...

42:41.057 --> 42:44.102
Simply put, Sessions is not going
to support any consent decree anywhere.

42:44.185 --> 42:46.813
We need to get this done
before Trump is inaugurated

42:46.897 --> 42:48.272
-on January 20th.
I agree.

42:48.649 --> 42:50.441
Due to the unforeseen circumstances

42:50.525 --> 42:52.986
of the national election,
time is of the essence.

42:53.069 --> 42:54.321
This is not something to rush.

42:55.489 --> 42:59.660
Of course not.
But with my team, Jason and Ganesha,

43:00.077 --> 43:04.372
I can iron out the finer points
of the decree with Nicole, Vanita Gupta,

43:04.455 --> 43:05.749
and the DOJ.

43:06.124 --> 43:09.378
We do have concerns.
But let me be clear, Madam Mayor,

43:09.461 --> 43:13.297
I support this initiative.
It's not a cure-all,

43:13.756 --> 43:15.508
but it is a tool for reform.

43:15.593 --> 43:17.051
Mayor Pugh, may I jump in?

43:17.386 --> 43:18.511
Please.

43:18.594 --> 43:20.638
I've looked at what this has cost
in other cities.

43:21.055 --> 43:23.266
You're gonna have to hire
monitoring teams.

43:23.349 --> 43:25.644
You're gonna have to purchase
new equipment, new technologies,

43:25.728 --> 43:28.188
body cameras for all officers
on the street.

43:28.606 --> 43:30.440
Are you aware of the expenditure
on those items?

43:30.523 --> 43:31.775
The money has to come from somewhere,

43:31.859 --> 43:34.235
or rather, it will be taken
from somewhere else.

43:34.652 --> 43:35.946
I'm all for police reform.

43:36.904 --> 43:40.242
But not at the expense of social programs.
I'm especially concerned

43:40.326 --> 43:43.494
that this decree could siphon off
funds earmarked for young Black boys

43:43.578 --> 43:45.121
who have been
historically marginalized here.

43:45.539 --> 43:47.625
That's right.
We can't forget about my babies.

43:47.958 --> 43:50.793
No one's suggesting this is an either-or
proposition.

43:51.170 --> 43:53.631
The consent decree is designed
to protect citizens,

43:53.714 --> 43:55.841
including those young men
you're talking about.

43:55.924 --> 43:59.135
But we can't ignore the expense of it.
And frankly,

43:59.218 --> 44:01.680
a report is not gonna be a cure
for bad leadership

44:01.763 --> 44:04.266
within the department,
present company excepted, Chief Davis.

44:04.683 --> 44:07.477
I mean, how many police commissioners
have we had in the last ten years?

44:07.560 --> 44:08.519
Three, four?

44:08.854 --> 44:11.272
You can't keep throwing money
at a management problem.

44:11.982 --> 44:15.653
These are dollars that would be
better spent enticing business interest

44:15.736 --> 44:17.196
and development in Baltimore.

44:19.155 --> 44:20.240
We have to do something.

44:20.324 --> 44:23.869
Well, I would not in good conscience
recommend to our mayor

44:23.952 --> 44:26.705
that we increase the police budget
to accommodate this decree.

44:27.164 --> 44:29.750
In my opinion, Chief Davis,
you're gonna have to find the money

44:29.833 --> 44:31.000
within your existing budget.

44:31.377 --> 44:34.380
And that means making significant cuts
to the department

44:34.463 --> 44:36.756
in advance of the decree
being implemented.

44:43.389 --> 44:44.639
I wanna know if we're ready.

44:44.723 --> 44:47.393
Well, we can always get more evidence
to shore up our case.

44:47.725 --> 44:50.228
I'd really like to see how far up
the chain this goes.

44:50.604 --> 44:52.606
We're fighting time here.
I'm worried about leaks.

44:52.980 --> 44:54.858
None of the brass know about us.

44:55.192 --> 44:57.193
We've even managed to keep
the commissioner out of the loop.

44:57.778 --> 45:00.738
But the fact is, we have enough.
We have taped conversations

45:00.822 --> 45:02.949
where the subjects discuss robberies
they committed

45:03.033 --> 45:05.285
resulting in the illegal seizure
of cash and drugs.

45:06.035 --> 45:09.080
We've recorded jail calls
where the inmates talk about being robbed

45:09.163 --> 45:11.041
of drugs and money by those same subjects.

45:11.917 --> 45:13.627
That's enough
for a racketeering conspiracy.

45:13.961 --> 45:15.671
Will the victims testify in court?

45:15.753 --> 45:18.589
Not all of them, no.
Some of them don't trust us,

45:18.674 --> 45:22.428
and to some, snitching on a cop
is still snitching.

45:22.928 --> 45:26.056
But we've got a couple of people
that I'm pretty certain will stand up.

45:27.599 --> 45:28.642
What about wire fraud?

45:29.016 --> 45:30.059
Rock solid.

45:30.769 --> 45:32.603
We have multiple conversations on the wire

45:32.688 --> 45:34.730
with massive overtime theft
being discussed.

45:35.273 --> 45:37.526
I've used my departmental access
to pull their timecards.

45:37.609 --> 45:39.360
It wasn't just others clocking in for 'em.

45:39.861 --> 45:43.573
Taylor was pulling OT
when he was in the Dominican Republic.

45:43.948 --> 45:47.118
Jenkins was collecting overtime
when he was on... on vacation

45:47.201 --> 45:48.244
with his family in Myrtle Beach.

45:51.540 --> 45:52.499
It's time to go.

45:53.250 --> 45:56.253
We're on the indictments.
You handle the logistics of the arrests

45:56.336 --> 45:57.587
and keep us apprised.

45:58.129 --> 46:00.256
And we'll tell the police commissioner
at the last moment.

46:01.841 --> 46:02.884
As for the dog and pony,

46:02.968 --> 46:05.179
the US Attorney will wanna be
at the podium.

46:05.262 --> 46:06.305
Rosenstein?

46:06.387 --> 46:08.431
Yeah, he's getting bumped up
in the Trump administration,

46:08.514 --> 46:10.267
and this will be a nice send-off for him.

46:11.684 --> 46:12.936
-Okay.
-All right.

46:18.567 --> 46:22.905
MARCH 1, 2017

46:46.552 --> 46:47.553
Wow.

46:48.847 --> 46:50.348
What is that from?

46:51.099 --> 46:52.559
Debussy's "Prélude."

46:53.768 --> 46:54.894
I feel like I...

46:55.394 --> 46:57.147
heard that on an episode of Star Trek.

46:59.900 --> 47:01.734
You know how to play some... you know,
some other stuff?

47:01.817 --> 47:02.903
Classical mostly.

47:03.487 --> 47:04.946
Like Jethro Tull? Aqualung ,

47:05.030 --> 47:06.948
I mean that's some classical shit
right there, right?

47:07.031 --> 47:09.116
Someday, John, you're gonna surprise me.

47:09.201 --> 47:10.159
Maybe.

47:11.702 --> 47:12.745
You sleep in that shirt?

47:13.914 --> 47:15.624
I don't think I slept at all. You?

47:16.249 --> 47:18.669
Not much. The details kept me up.

47:19.670 --> 47:21.629
So many things can go wrong.

47:23.005 --> 47:25.591
Your people are monitoring the GPS
on their phones, right?

47:26.259 --> 47:28.928
Yeah, as of this morning,
they're all in the Baltimore area.

47:29.471 --> 47:31.973
And they all got their orders
to report to IAD.

47:32.390 --> 47:34.141
They all confirmed their appointments.

47:37.813 --> 47:38.897
Jensen.

47:39.355 --> 47:41.732
Hey. He's on the move. Stand by.

47:42.400 --> 47:43.359
Copy that.

47:46.654 --> 47:48.114
Jenkins just left his house.

47:48.490 --> 47:49.491
Let's go.

47:50.241 --> 47:52.494
BALTIMORE POLICE DEPARTMENT

47:52.578 --> 47:55.038
Look at you, Steve.
Getting that good police work in, huh?

47:55.122 --> 47:57.498
You know, committing suicide by cigarette.

47:58.375 --> 48:01.085
-Got a date with IAD?
-Yeah, some nuisance shit.

48:01.168 --> 48:02.169
You know, vehicular.

48:11.430 --> 48:12.638
-What's good?
-What's up, man?

48:12.722 --> 48:13.681
Passed out.

48:19.895 --> 48:23.233
RESERVED FOR LIEUTENANT

48:33.827 --> 48:36.413
Seven officers from the plainclothes unit

48:36.495 --> 48:38.957
known as the Gun Trace Task Force

48:39.623 --> 48:43.961
have been arrested
and charged with racketeering conspiracy

48:44.420 --> 48:47.548
and racketeering-related charges,
including robbery,

48:47.631 --> 48:50.427
extortion, and overtime fraud.

48:51.135 --> 48:56.099
These officers have been involved
in a pernicious conspiracy scheme

48:56.474 --> 48:58.810
that included abuse of power.

49:01.229 --> 49:02.563
Commissioner Davis.

49:03.482 --> 49:04.608
Commissioner Davis,

49:04.690 --> 49:06.233
in light of these arrests,
what are your thoughts

49:06.568 --> 49:08.236
on the deeper implications
for the department?

49:11.239 --> 49:14.368
These officers,
I have no sympathy for them.

49:15.076 --> 49:18.664
They are like 1930s gangsters
as far as I'm concerned.

49:20.082 --> 49:23.501
As for the department,
I'll act swiftly and decisively

49:23.584 --> 49:25.127
to address the problem areas.

49:25.544 --> 49:28.172
I'll immediately disband
select plainclothes units

49:28.255 --> 49:32.052
and order those officers
back into uniformed patrol.

49:33.762 --> 49:36.639
This is the absolute,
final dismantling of VCID.

49:39.893 --> 49:44.814
Officers Gondo, Hendrix, Hersl, Jenkins,
Rayam, Taylor, and Ward

49:44.897 --> 49:47.983
are now in FBI custody
after being arrested this morning...

49:48.067 --> 49:49.985
-Oh, sh...
-...at the Internal Affairs Department

49:50.069 --> 49:51.028
on Kirk Avenue.

49:51.530 --> 49:54.824
Officials say that some of these officers
are named in prior complaints...

49:54.907 --> 49:56.660
-Holy shit.
-...have been previously accused

49:56.743 --> 49:59.204
of using excessive force
or of other wrongdoing.

49:59.537 --> 50:01.289
-Hey, Sean.
-In fact, the city has paid out more...

50:01.373 --> 50:02.916
You used to work with Jenkins, didn't you?

50:03.000 --> 50:05.043
...than half a million in settlements
related to the actions

50:05.126 --> 50:06.920
-of some of these officers.
-What was that guy like?

50:07.004 --> 50:08.921
A long-time public defender we spoke with
had this to say...

50:13.551 --> 50:15.553
...accountability issues for many years.

50:15.636 --> 50:18.432
We have worked tirelessly
to highlight the issues

50:18.515 --> 50:21.934
on the force, but much of our efforts
were ignored by the department.

50:22.017 --> 50:24.395
What message does that send
to the criticism...

50:24.478 --> 50:27.816
-You all right, man?
-Yeah, I... I just gotta hit the head.

50:27.899 --> 50:30.027
-As recently as late last year...
-This is some fucked up shit.

50:30.110 --> 50:31.777
...Commissioner Davis praised
the Gun Trace unit

50:31.861 --> 50:32.945
in a departmental newsletter.

50:33.030 --> 50:36.742
Sergeant Wayne Jenkins was to be seen
as an example for getting guns...

50:38.368 --> 50:42.788
The Gun Trace Task Force made more
than 110 gun arrests in 2016.

50:42.872 --> 50:45.374
Here's Davis responding
at the briefing earlier today.

50:51.757 --> 50:55.010
Why don't you do me a favor, man?
Just go and toss the car one more time,

50:55.093 --> 50:56.595
you know, in case we missed something.

50:59.430 --> 51:03.184
Man, you fucking planted that shit.
Get off me, man! Y'all cruddy as hell!

51:08.065 --> 51:09.566
Man, you got it now, dawg.

51:10.525 --> 51:12.194
That was some serious police work, man.

51:15.112 --> 51:17.449
...to describe this rogue
plainclothes unit

51:17.532 --> 51:18.909
of the Baltimore Police Department.

51:18.992 --> 51:20.994
-Danny Hersl.
-These brazen officers

51:21.078 --> 51:23.747
-allegedly stopped innocent victims...
-Our poster boy got caught up in this.

51:23.829 --> 51:26.208
...without cause, robbing them
of large quantities of cash and guns.

51:26.792 --> 51:28.376
The defendants are accused
of racketeering.

52:04.329 --> 52:07.206
The way I was raised, there wasn't any way
I wasn't gonna be a lawyer.

52:07.289 --> 52:08.625
Oh, I know how that works.

52:09.333 --> 52:11.128
Your father was a...
He was a judge, right?

52:11.211 --> 52:12.461
US District Court.

52:13.255 --> 52:15.589
So, I guess it was preordained
that you would go into law.

52:16.090 --> 52:18.510
I have a sibling named James,
and he had no interest

52:18.592 --> 52:19.843
in going to college.

52:19.928 --> 52:22.304
So someone in our house
was going to law school.

52:22.972 --> 52:23.931
Fell on me.

52:24.348 --> 52:25.432
Got it.

52:25.516 --> 52:28.311
But I... I made a wrong turn for a while.

52:28.395 --> 52:29.479
How so?

52:29.562 --> 52:33.066
Well, early on, I was
a Trial Team AUSA in DC,

52:33.150 --> 52:35.026
prosecuting mostly drug cases.

52:36.069 --> 52:38.155
And it got to me.

52:39.406 --> 52:42.616
Day in, day out, in courtrooms,
sending young Black men to prison.

52:44.411 --> 52:47.080
But I guess, I needed to go through that
to make the next step,

52:47.164 --> 52:48.248
and pivot to Civil Rights, so...

52:48.831 --> 52:50.040
You grew up in D.C.?

52:50.125 --> 52:55.046
Outside the city.
Bethesda. It's high-income, mostly White.

52:55.129 --> 52:58.508
You know, not a very diverse area
to say the least.

53:00.218 --> 53:04.306
My parents knew we'd lose
a little something growing up there,

53:04.389 --> 53:06.892
but they figured the benefits
outweighed the bad,

53:06.975 --> 53:08.393
and they were right.

53:09.351 --> 53:10.936
I have been very fortunate.

53:12.271 --> 53:17.109
You know, my kid brother,
he got a... a lot worse than I ever did.

53:18.152 --> 53:19.362
He's a tile man.

53:19.446 --> 53:21.406
He does high-end bathrooms.
A real craftsman.

53:21.864 --> 53:24.659
So, you know, he has his hair braided.
He wears workman's clothes,

53:24.743 --> 53:25.868
jeans, hoodies.

53:25.951 --> 53:29.289
When he was in his teens,
he'd be standing outside our house,

53:29.372 --> 53:33.792
and this happened more than once,
the Montgomery County Police would stop

53:33.876 --> 53:35.836
and ask him, "What are you doing here?"

53:36.920 --> 53:39.381
He'd point back at the house
that we grew up in,

53:39.465 --> 53:40.800
and he'd say, "I live here."

53:43.303 --> 53:44.720
They couldn't see a Bethesda kid.

53:46.640 --> 53:49.184
When they looked at James,
all they could see was a nigger.

53:53.103 --> 53:55.482
Yeah. Yeah, I get that.

53:55.564 --> 53:58.652
One time, he was coming home from work,
driving down our street,

53:59.318 --> 54:02.072
and a couple cop cars followed him
into our driveway.

54:03.281 --> 54:06.700
When James got out of the car,
I don't know, maybe he got out too fast,

54:06.785 --> 54:08.202
but they cuffed him.

54:08.744 --> 54:10.538
Said that he made a threatening move.

54:10.622 --> 54:13.457
And on the report, to justify the stop,
they lied.

54:13.541 --> 54:15.584
They said that he was speeding
down our street.

54:16.043 --> 54:18.671
All he was saying was,
"Why are you doing me like this?

54:19.506 --> 54:22.509
I just worked a 12-hour day,
and all I was doing

54:22.592 --> 54:24.177
was driving to my house."

54:25.886 --> 54:28.013
I came outside, and so did my father.

54:28.848 --> 54:31.684
And there was a Black cop,
and he wouldn't answer

54:31.768 --> 54:34.645
any of our questions.
And the other cop, the one who cuffed him,

54:34.728 --> 54:35.939
the White dude,

54:37.190 --> 54:38.191
he threatened my dad.

54:39.525 --> 54:42.569
And it was all for nothing.
None of the cops showed up in court.

54:45.031 --> 54:46.323
The damage was done.

54:48.867 --> 54:50.078
Where's your brother now?

54:51.121 --> 54:54.791
After that last incident,
he moved to Atlanta.

54:57.251 --> 54:58.503
I don't hate the police,

54:58.878 --> 55:02.090
but it's fair to say that my brother
has no love for them at all,

55:02.840 --> 55:04.134
and never will.

55:07.846 --> 55:10.639
I don't know if what we're doing
is gonna change a thing, Ahmed.

55:10.723 --> 55:11.724
But shit...

55:18.480 --> 55:19.481
You ready for another?

55:20.984 --> 55:23.528
I gotta go home. We have work to do.
