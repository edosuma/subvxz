00:35.183 --> 00:36.896
If I don't make it...

00:37.804 --> 00:40.304
There's something
I want you to know, Allanon.

00:41.941 --> 00:46.932
I wish that when you rode into
Shady Vale all those years ago,

00:47.614 --> 00:51.783
I wish that I had pointed you
in the opposite direction.

00:52.919 --> 00:56.354
That was not a choice
for you nor I to make.

00:56.361 --> 00:59.129
I did not choose Shea's destiny for him.

00:59.192 --> 01:01.659
Or Wil's for that matter.

01:04.096 --> 01:08.733
Their destinies chose them
even before they were born.

01:08.775 --> 01:10.714
So this is mine.

01:11.324 --> 01:13.707
My destiny.

01:16.242 --> 01:17.842
Some are born for sacrifice.

01:27.783 --> 01:30.297
To hell with you, Allanon!

01:30.533 --> 01:33.445
All you have ever brought my family

01:33.736 --> 01:37.025
is misery and heartbreak.

01:38.531 --> 01:43.768
I pray that you're not the last thing
I see before I leave this world.

02:39.025 --> 02:41.092
You're not from Barkroot?

02:41.761 --> 02:44.061
And this...

02:44.097 --> 02:45.963
This thing is what brought you here?

02:47.233 --> 02:49.600
It brought us to you.

02:49.636 --> 02:52.937
So that you could help us find
something. Something very important.

02:53.940 --> 02:56.040
He's telling you the truth.

02:56.075 --> 02:58.142
That I'm some sort of "Shannara?"

02:58.177 --> 03:00.311
That is the most ridiculous
thing I've ever heard.

03:00.346 --> 03:02.313
Shea, you come from a chosen line.

03:02.348 --> 03:05.249
I'm a nobody. A farm hand.

03:05.285 --> 03:07.151
You're the furthest thing from a nobody.

03:08.121 --> 03:09.987
You save the Four Lands.

03:12.091 --> 03:13.524
I do?

03:13.559 --> 03:16.494
Which is why the Mord Wraiths
are chasing you.

03:16.529 --> 03:19.397
A month from now the Warlock
Lord will declare war.

03:19.432 --> 03:21.799
But you fight back.
You don't let 'em win.

03:25.805 --> 03:27.972
I'm sorry. Wrong guy.

03:29.642 --> 03:32.910
There's a darkness coming
and you have to be ready for it.

03:32.946 --> 03:34.812
You sound like my brother, Flick.

03:34.847 --> 03:36.682
The Four Lands is about
to face a great evil

03:36.703 --> 03:39.053
- and you are the one who stands up...
- Stop!

03:39.663 --> 03:42.086
- Shea...
- I can't defend anything.

03:42.093 --> 03:43.997
I can't even defend myself.

03:44.004 --> 03:45.654
Or my love for Heady...

03:46.263 --> 03:48.333
I'm not this "Shannara" guy
that you're looking for

03:48.340 --> 03:50.466
and I am most definitely not a hero.

03:50.712 --> 03:51.899
I get it.

03:52.063 --> 03:54.665
I said the exact same thing
when the time came for me to...

03:54.701 --> 03:56.334
I don't believe any of this.

03:58.279 --> 03:59.857
When you were little there was a summer

03:59.864 --> 04:02.047
when the crops failed
and food was scarce.

04:03.302 --> 04:05.636
You found a rabbit
in your mother's snare.

04:05.643 --> 04:08.010
It was enough to make a stew
to feed your family, but,

04:08.348 --> 04:10.581
you couldn't stop looking in its eyes.

04:10.616 --> 04:12.882
And so you made sure nobody was around

04:12.889 --> 04:14.304
and then you set it free.

04:23.029 --> 04:24.328
I've never told anyone that.

04:24.964 --> 04:27.498
Not yet, you haven't.

04:27.533 --> 04:30.368
The Four Lands is going to depend on you

04:31.337 --> 04:33.037
and now the future does, too.

04:34.440 --> 04:35.873
I need your help.

04:36.909 --> 04:38.409
Someone's life depends on it.

04:39.212 --> 04:41.045
And what if I'm not ready?

04:41.080 --> 04:42.713
I asked a Druid the same question once.

04:43.883 --> 04:45.783
But I've learned that
fate waits for no man.

04:47.253 --> 04:48.719
When? A Druid?

04:49.986 --> 04:51.696
I'm gonna let that part be a surprise.

04:53.092 --> 04:54.625
The wraiths will come back for him.

04:56.629 --> 05:00.331
Shea, you were meant for
bigger things than this farm.

05:00.338 --> 05:03.406
But if the Mord Wraiths are already
looking for you, you aren't safe.

05:04.922 --> 05:06.288
We need to get you into hiding.

05:07.540 --> 05:08.906
And what if they do find me?

05:09.976 --> 05:11.409
What is it that they want?

05:12.912 --> 05:14.078
They want you dead.

05:23.389 --> 05:25.423
You're sure you want to do this?

05:25.430 --> 05:27.055
Go through with this marriage?

05:28.061 --> 05:30.846
My mother wants
to take control of Arborlon.

05:31.708 --> 05:33.617
The only way to stop her
is to make her believe

05:33.624 --> 05:35.279
she's getting what she wants.

05:36.387 --> 05:37.660
Once our kingdoms have joined,

05:37.674 --> 05:39.745
Tamlin will have no
choice but to back you.

05:40.081 --> 05:41.644
To back us.

05:41.681 --> 05:43.148
And together

05:43.155 --> 05:45.992
we can defeat the Crimson and
bring peace to The Four Lands.

05:52.752 --> 05:54.118
What about Eretria?

05:55.388 --> 05:57.988
To choose a marriage
of convenience over love.

05:57.995 --> 06:01.051
This is the only way
to make sure that she's safe.

06:01.966 --> 06:05.268
Lyria, if we do this we have
to be friends and partners.

06:06.265 --> 06:08.466
No secrets. No lies.

06:08.986 --> 06:10.300
Agreed.

06:10.971 --> 06:12.511
You have my word.

06:13.324 --> 06:14.730
Our people come first.

06:16.966 --> 06:18.032
So what do you say?

06:30.256 --> 06:32.156
I say you're gonna make
one hell of a queen.

06:40.484 --> 06:43.285
The Warlock Lord's power
was once unmatched.

06:43.292 --> 06:44.543
If he is reborn,

06:44.550 --> 06:47.333
then he will use anything
within his reach to reclaim that power.

06:47.340 --> 06:49.273
I would never help him. You know that!

06:49.308 --> 06:50.763
You might not be able to resist.

06:50.770 --> 06:53.214
So you're saying that I'm
doomed to be his puppet?

06:53.221 --> 06:54.357
I'm saying

06:54.364 --> 06:57.251
that your power makes you an integral
part of what is going to unfold.

06:57.258 --> 07:00.918
Be that as a vessel of darkness or
a protector of all that is good.

07:00.925 --> 07:02.492
What can I do?

07:02.555 --> 07:04.655
Get prepared for what's to come.

07:04.690 --> 07:07.095
The greatest battle you'll face
is within you.

07:07.102 --> 07:08.649
You could end up being all that stands

07:08.656 --> 07:10.611
between the Warlock
Lord and Heaven's Well.

07:11.364 --> 07:12.787
If he corrupts the Well,

07:13.393 --> 07:14.549
then Human,

07:14.556 --> 07:16.918
Elf, Gnome, all living things

07:16.925 --> 07:19.043
will be consumed by darkness.

07:36.506 --> 07:38.689
At least we don't have
to swim in this time.

07:38.724 --> 07:40.024
You've been here before?

07:40.059 --> 07:41.625
It's a perfect hiding spot.

07:42.678 --> 07:46.357
Is there anywhere in here where
you might have hidden something?

07:46.372 --> 07:48.105
You mean the thing you're looking for?

07:48.112 --> 07:49.580
Are you gonna tell me what it is?

07:50.453 --> 07:51.986
It's a skull.

07:51.993 --> 07:53.068
A skull?

07:53.239 --> 07:55.762
I don't know anything about any skull.

07:56.816 --> 07:59.731
We're running out of time. My
uncle won't last much longer.

07:59.738 --> 08:02.071
We know the skull is hidden
somewhere in Shady Vale, right?

08:02.078 --> 08:04.444
I mean, why else would the time
portal have brought us here?

08:04.451 --> 08:06.106
We just need to keep
following the clues.

08:06.113 --> 08:08.247
Except the only clue
we found so far is...

08:08.254 --> 08:11.021
I told you. I don't know
anything about a skull.

08:11.057 --> 08:12.523
Please. Try and remember.

08:12.558 --> 08:14.391
It's a matter of life and death.

08:14.456 --> 08:18.324
Has anyone unusual, anyone at all,
come through Shady Vale lately?

08:18.331 --> 08:20.764
Other than you two? Not a soul.

08:20.800 --> 08:22.433
Anything out of the ordinary?

08:22.440 --> 08:24.519
Look, I want to help you.
I do, but I have to go.

08:24.526 --> 08:26.332
I have to meet Heady at
the Solstice Festival.

08:26.339 --> 08:27.704
You can't, it's too dangerous.

08:27.711 --> 08:29.643
But we've entered
a scarecrow in the competition.

08:29.650 --> 08:31.465
We've been working on it
together for months.

08:31.472 --> 08:32.784
Scarecrow competition?

08:32.792 --> 08:36.051
You really need to rethink
your seduction techniques.

08:38.650 --> 08:40.451
That'll teach you
to mess with Wil Ohmsford.

08:43.059 --> 08:44.793
We need to check the scarecrow.

08:44.911 --> 08:46.114
You think a future

08:46.121 --> 08:49.593
him went all the way back in time
to hide the skull in a scarecrow?

08:49.600 --> 08:51.129
So far that's the only hunch I have.

08:51.530 --> 08:52.796
Hey. You.

08:53.330 --> 08:55.008
Wait here, we'll be back.

08:55.015 --> 08:57.258
No. I'm coming with you.
Heady's heart is set on winning

08:57.265 --> 08:58.798
- and if we don't go...
- You can't go!

08:58.805 --> 09:00.335
I have to go, if we don't win this...

09:00.342 --> 09:01.426
You do win, okay?

09:01.433 --> 09:02.827
You win the damn competition

09:02.834 --> 09:04.996
and Heady tells her father
that she's in love with you.

09:06.846 --> 09:08.479
I've heard the story my whole life.

09:09.093 --> 09:10.748
How could you know that?

09:10.947 --> 09:13.314
And what do you mean, your whole life?
Who are you?

09:15.688 --> 09:16.820
I'm your son.

09:26.270 --> 09:30.009
Make sure the Elven Ambassador
is situated at the front.

09:30.336 --> 09:33.370
This wedding will be the first
to bring our people together

09:33.377 --> 09:35.277
and no one can appear to be slighted.

09:39.821 --> 09:41.755
The bride and groom.

09:41.762 --> 09:43.770
To what do I owe the pleasure
of your presence?

09:44.281 --> 09:45.613
Diplomatic relations.

09:45.649 --> 09:47.343
The time has come
to eradicate the Crimson,

09:47.350 --> 09:48.983
and General Riga, once and for all.

09:49.019 --> 09:50.718
We'd like your support.

09:50.725 --> 09:51.830
Of course.

09:51.939 --> 09:54.597
Consider my weapons stores
at your full disposal.

09:54.624 --> 09:57.058
We need a brigade
of Leah soldiers as well.

09:57.093 --> 10:00.495
It's "we" now?
My, how things have changed.

10:03.500 --> 10:04.500
Your Majesty.

10:10.648 --> 10:12.290
It appears the East Wing of the palace

10:12.304 --> 10:13.937
was breached last night by the Crimson.

10:13.944 --> 10:17.412
They tunneled in with explosives and
broke out the prisoner, Valcaa.

10:17.447 --> 10:19.414
Ten of our men were killed.

10:19.449 --> 10:22.150
Consider three brigades
at your service, King Ander.

10:23.153 --> 10:24.185
Thank you, Your Highness.

10:32.095 --> 10:33.394
Or, should I call you "Mother"?

10:36.833 --> 10:38.499
"Your Highness" will suffice.

10:48.578 --> 10:50.011
It's time to end this.

10:51.147 --> 10:52.747
Bring me Garet Jax.

11:38.995 --> 11:40.228
None of these are the one.

11:40.263 --> 11:41.329
Are you sure?

11:41.364 --> 11:42.730
Positive. I'd know it anywhere.

11:44.934 --> 11:47.635
Have either of you seen Shea?
The judging is about to start.

11:47.670 --> 11:50.371
Uh, sorry. No, we haven't.

11:50.407 --> 11:53.808
Wait, Heady, I could've sworn I saw
another scarecrow out here earlier.

11:53.843 --> 11:56.577
It had a green vest, wooden buttons.

11:56.613 --> 11:58.312
The Ohmsford Scarecrow.

11:58.348 --> 12:00.715
It's out in the south field
just beyond the pond.

12:00.750 --> 12:02.116
- Thank you.
- Bye.

12:16.733 --> 12:18.099
If they don't make it back,

12:20.336 --> 12:22.804
we're both gonna die in here.
You know that, right?

12:22.839 --> 12:24.772
The longer we stay, the weaker we get.

12:25.608 --> 12:26.974
It's kind of poetic really.

12:29.746 --> 12:31.028
You know, if I'm being honest,

12:31.035 --> 12:33.364
you're the closest thing
I've ever had to a father.

12:35.785 --> 12:36.984
How tragic is that?

12:38.521 --> 12:40.321
And what about the Warlock Lord?

12:41.391 --> 12:43.157
Do you think he has
the answers you seek?

12:44.794 --> 12:46.727
He will betray you.

12:46.763 --> 12:48.162
It's not too late, Bandon.

12:50.400 --> 12:53.701
You're yet to cross
the threshold into darkness.

12:56.673 --> 12:58.106
You can still be saved.

12:59.709 --> 13:01.709
By who? You?

13:03.913 --> 13:05.813
I'll take my chances
with the Warlock Lord.

13:08.118 --> 13:10.651
That is a decision
you will live to regret.

13:16.793 --> 13:18.826
It's not like you to give up so easily.

13:22.265 --> 13:23.327
What's wrong, Allanon?

13:25.135 --> 13:26.167
Stay away.

13:27.203 --> 13:28.215
You look older.

13:29.613 --> 13:30.648
Weaker.

13:32.642 --> 13:34.175
Time itself has begun to consume you.

13:38.681 --> 13:40.515
I knew something was different.

13:42.952 --> 13:44.018
You're dying, aren't you?

13:47.090 --> 13:48.823
Even a Druid's life must end.

14:05.074 --> 14:07.408
- It's not here.
- Are you sure?

14:07.443 --> 14:08.709
It's not here, Wil.

14:13.683 --> 14:15.542
It was not a good hunch.

14:15.549 --> 14:17.698
But I doubt Allanon and Shea
would've hidden the skull

14:17.705 --> 14:19.084
where it could be so easily found.

14:19.091 --> 14:20.757
You're right. I guess.

14:29.265 --> 14:33.701
That's it! The scarecrow is the clue.

14:33.736 --> 14:36.103
Wil, I told you it's not in there.

14:36.139 --> 14:37.438
Not in. Under.

14:38.804 --> 14:41.338
You think they'd bury it in a cornfield?

14:41.345 --> 14:42.395
And even if they had,

14:42.402 --> 14:44.502
wouldn't they have just taken
us here in present day?

14:44.509 --> 14:45.646
Of course it would.

14:45.682 --> 14:48.482
But this, it isn't a field anymore.

14:48.489 --> 14:50.269
It's a lake.

14:50.276 --> 14:52.857
My mom always talked about how
the week after she and my dad,

14:52.864 --> 14:55.122
won the competition
the dam upstream burst.

14:55.158 --> 14:57.725
Half the Ohmsford's fields
were permanently flooded.

14:57.760 --> 14:59.493
They almost lost everything.

14:59.529 --> 15:01.392
Everything except the
old scarecrow Flick

15:01.399 --> 15:03.651
found down river on his way home.

15:05.468 --> 15:07.435
So, if the portal brought us here now...

15:07.470 --> 15:08.703
We'd be ten feet underwater.

15:08.738 --> 15:09.971
It's the perfect hiding spot.

15:33.596 --> 15:34.629
All right.

15:40.828 --> 15:42.194
The hem isn't right.

15:42.230 --> 15:43.596
It needs to be perfect.

15:44.399 --> 15:47.166
This is all wrong. Start over.

15:48.403 --> 15:49.702
I kind of like it.

15:49.737 --> 15:52.171
Who's wearing the dress, you or Lyria?

15:52.206 --> 15:53.272
Leave us.

15:56.377 --> 15:58.210
You got here quickly.

15:58.246 --> 16:00.613
I know what happens to people
that keep you waiting.

16:00.648 --> 16:01.947
I'd like to stay pretty.

16:02.750 --> 16:04.216
What's the job <i> du jour?</i>

16:04.252 --> 16:05.751
General Riga.

16:05.787 --> 16:07.153
That's quite the reversal.

16:07.188 --> 16:08.988
I thought you two were tight.

16:09.023 --> 16:11.157
Where's your loyalty, Your Highness?

16:11.192 --> 16:14.460
Coming from the man who measures
his loyalty in gold.

16:15.563 --> 16:18.364
General Riga has outlived
his usefulness.

16:18.399 --> 16:20.433
And what exactly was his "usefulness"?

16:20.468 --> 16:23.169
Riga wants to eradicate magic users.

16:23.204 --> 16:26.639
I'm in the weapons business
and magic is bad for business

16:26.674 --> 16:31.076
Plus, I needed Arborlon unstable
to secure Lyria her king.

16:31.913 --> 16:33.212
A real win-win.

16:33.219 --> 16:34.861
But now he's over-reached

16:34.868 --> 16:38.050
and his ambitions need to be clipped.

16:38.057 --> 16:39.772
I'd love to help,

16:39.779 --> 16:42.316
but the General's holed
up in his fortress.

16:42.323 --> 16:44.089
And I've already
made it out of there once.

16:44.125 --> 16:45.691
Only a fool would tempt fate again.

16:46.527 --> 16:47.993
He's not in Graymark.

16:49.330 --> 16:51.697
Today, he sent word for me
to meet him at this location.

16:55.069 --> 16:59.839
Clandestine trysts with fanatical Elves.

16:59.874 --> 17:01.574
You've really lowered your standards.

17:02.210 --> 17:03.509
I want him handled.

17:04.045 --> 17:05.176
Consider him dead.

17:26.666 --> 17:28.334
Shea? We found the skull.

17:28.368 --> 17:30.302
Where is he?

17:30.338 --> 17:33.072
- Shea?
- He's gone, Wil.

17:33.079 --> 17:35.365
He probably went to the
festival to meet up with Heady.

17:35.959 --> 17:37.746
He was supposed to stay put!

17:37.753 --> 17:39.501
Like you would listen
to two time travelers

17:39.508 --> 17:41.190
from the future rather than your heart.

17:41.197 --> 17:42.519
If the Mord Wraiths get to him...

17:42.526 --> 17:44.371
- We can't let that happen.
- He won't survive.

17:44.378 --> 17:46.244
He doesn't have
the Elfstones yet. Come on!

18:08.075 --> 18:10.743
Think you're gonna need
a few more bodyguards, General.

18:10.778 --> 18:12.111
Where's Tamlin?

18:12.146 --> 18:13.412
She's done with you.

18:13.447 --> 18:16.582
Thinks you've become...
How did she phrase it?

18:17.318 --> 18:18.984
"Ineffective."

18:19.020 --> 18:20.185
Why are you helping her?

18:21.022 --> 18:22.521
When you and I, Jax...

18:23.858 --> 18:25.691
we're no different.

18:25.726 --> 18:28.027
You're a soldier who's lost good men.

18:28.034 --> 18:29.852
Save the speech, General.

18:29.859 --> 18:32.330
There's nothing you can say
that'll change the outcome here.

18:33.434 --> 18:34.772
So, you're just going to kill me?

18:35.636 --> 18:37.036
That's the plan.

18:51.385 --> 18:55.354
Valcaa? Thought your
miserable ass was locked up.

18:55.389 --> 18:56.889
Oh, I wouldn't miss this.

19:00.761 --> 19:02.227
Tamlin will pay for her betrayal.

19:02.797 --> 19:03.963
Take care of him.

19:32.259 --> 19:33.325
Heady!

19:40.267 --> 19:41.333
Heady, wait.

19:43.231 --> 19:44.262
What do you want?

19:44.972 --> 19:47.006
I'm sorry I got upset.

19:47.041 --> 19:49.186
The thought of losing you
just sent me over the edge.

19:49.677 --> 19:50.776
Can you please forgive me?

20:03.991 --> 20:05.090
Oh, God.

20:11.365 --> 20:12.765
Shea!

20:23.544 --> 20:25.544
Shannara!

20:30.618 --> 20:31.884
No!

20:41.146 --> 20:42.618
This wasn't supposed to happen.

20:43.972 --> 20:45.496
Let's get him into the barn.

20:51.934 --> 20:53.200
Is he gonna be okay?

20:53.235 --> 20:55.035
He's lost a lot of blood.

20:57.239 --> 20:59.273
Wil's a trained healer.
He's in good hands.

21:28.938 --> 21:30.371
It's a miracle.

21:31.674 --> 21:33.073
Try magic.

21:35.077 --> 21:36.910
But then he should be good as new.

21:42.284 --> 21:44.918
I will never forget
what you've done for us.

21:49.291 --> 21:51.692
You and Shea are not gonna have
an easy road.

21:53.129 --> 21:56.897
Together you'll have
a lot of tough challenges.

21:56.932 --> 22:01.135
Because his destiny, it carries
with it tremendous responsibility.

22:01.170 --> 22:04.872
And a whole host of trouble that
he won't always handle well.

22:05.608 --> 22:06.940
He'll need you.

22:06.976 --> 22:09.877
But as long as you remember
how much you love him,

22:09.912 --> 22:12.446
there's nothing you won't
be able to get through.

22:14.884 --> 22:16.550
You're a special man, Wil.

22:16.585 --> 22:18.285
Well,

22:18.320 --> 22:20.354
I can't take all the credit.

22:21.957 --> 22:23.724
I had an amazing mom.

22:27.963 --> 22:29.530
She's the one who taught me...

22:31.100 --> 22:32.433
Taught me how to be.

22:34.270 --> 22:36.103
I thank her every day.

22:46.982 --> 22:49.483
I'm going to
take my time and enjoy this.

22:49.518 --> 22:50.751
Any last words?

22:58.227 --> 22:59.660
Not off the top of my head.

23:00.857 --> 23:01.897
How about you?

24:11.033 --> 24:12.399
Cogline?

24:15.905 --> 24:17.304
Where did you go?

24:22.811 --> 24:23.911
Cogline?

24:24.747 --> 24:25.913
You in here?

25:48.230 --> 25:51.832
Wow. Remind me never to piss you off.

25:54.803 --> 25:56.370
How'd you find me?

25:56.405 --> 25:58.772
I'm a bounty hunter,
finding people is what I do.

25:58.807 --> 26:00.007
What was that thing?

26:01.180 --> 26:02.777
Guess it doesn't matter now.

26:04.680 --> 26:05.912
What happened to you?

26:05.948 --> 26:08.682
Had a little run-in with
General Riga and his friends.

26:08.717 --> 26:10.150
Are you all right?

26:10.185 --> 26:12.052
Ego's a bit bruised, but I'll live.

26:12.087 --> 26:14.488
Tamlin sent me to kill Riga,
but that went south.

26:14.523 --> 26:16.490
My bet is he'll go after the Queen.

26:16.525 --> 26:17.691
We have to warn them.

26:17.726 --> 26:19.292
Why do you think I'm here?

26:20.629 --> 26:22.429
You're doing the right thing, Jax.

26:22.464 --> 26:24.598
I'm not letting Riga get away with this.

26:24.633 --> 26:25.866
Not on my watch.

26:38.781 --> 26:39.910
I guess this is it.

26:39.917 --> 26:41.510
We don't know how to thank you.

26:41.517 --> 26:44.330
You don't have to thank me.
I'm just glad I was here to help.

26:44.337 --> 26:45.770
We should really get going.

26:49.491 --> 26:52.259
I wish you didn't have to go so soon.

26:52.294 --> 26:54.222
I feel like I'm just starting
to get to know you.

26:54.229 --> 26:55.829
Yeah. Me too.

26:57.199 --> 26:59.800
I was wondering, uh...

26:59.835 --> 27:01.879
I mean, I know how much I love Heady,

27:01.886 --> 27:03.870
and we've always talked
about having kids.

27:04.940 --> 27:06.740
What kind of father do I turn out to be?

27:10.212 --> 27:11.478
You're gonna be a great one.

27:12.481 --> 27:14.247
The very best any kid could ask for.

27:14.983 --> 27:16.616
Well,

27:16.652 --> 27:18.503
I figured I can't be
too much of a screw up

27:18.510 --> 27:20.550
if I end up with a son like you.

27:35.437 --> 27:36.837
Take care of yourself, Wil.

27:38.607 --> 27:39.940
You too, Dad.

27:50.552 --> 27:52.786
Be careful. Come on.

27:52.821 --> 27:53.854
Are you okay?

27:54.256 --> 27:55.956
Yeah.

27:55.991 --> 27:58.825
You're a terrible liar.

27:58.861 --> 28:01.361
What you did back there,
with your parents...

28:02.164 --> 28:03.445
It was pretty amazing.

28:03.452 --> 28:04.831
All in a day's work.

28:04.867 --> 28:06.399
Don't sell yourself short.

28:15.744 --> 28:16.877
Is that...

28:20.449 --> 28:22.616
I'm looking for the Ohmsford Farm.

28:22.651 --> 28:23.984
I'm Flick Ohmsford.

28:25.320 --> 28:28.421
It's about a mile south.
Red barn. You can't miss it.

28:31.860 --> 28:33.160
And so it begins.

28:54.967 --> 28:56.033
Uncle Flick!

28:59.372 --> 29:01.472
It's so good to see your face, Wil.

29:01.507 --> 29:03.440
You hang in there.

29:03.476 --> 29:05.376
He doesn't have much time.

29:05.411 --> 29:07.244
The spell is reversible,
Wil, I swear it.

29:07.980 --> 29:09.880
I only want what I came for.

29:09.916 --> 29:13.184
Double cross me, and I'll kill you.

29:13.219 --> 29:16.520
Let Bandon out. You said
Allanon taught you the incantation.

29:16.556 --> 29:19.423
Wil, it's a mistake.

29:19.458 --> 29:21.258
I'm sorry, there's no other way.

29:30.469 --> 29:32.570
Mareth, don't.

29:35.141 --> 29:37.441
Now, or Flick's gonna die.

29:39.812 --> 29:41.645
Wil, are you sure?

29:43.716 --> 29:45.049
You have to trust me, Mareth.

29:50.323 --> 29:53.023
Mareth, you don't have to do this.

29:53.059 --> 29:54.291
It's not too late.

30:29.695 --> 30:31.128
Give me the skull.

30:31.163 --> 30:32.463
Not until you heal him.

30:33.733 --> 30:35.900
I want the skull first.

30:35.935 --> 30:38.602
I told you, I'll keep my word.

30:38.638 --> 30:40.804
Forgive me if I don't put
a lot of stock in that.

30:40.840 --> 30:44.708
Every second you stall,
your uncle inches closer to death.

30:44.744 --> 30:46.944
Pretty soon not even I
will be able save him.

30:52.018 --> 30:53.026
Wil.

30:55.187 --> 30:56.520
I love you, boy.

31:22.982 --> 31:24.515
You're gonna pay.

31:40.599 --> 31:42.199
The Sword of Shannara.

32:07.526 --> 32:08.625
Shannara.

32:35.221 --> 32:38.222
Impressive. Your magic is strong.

32:38.257 --> 32:39.757
You should come with me.

32:39.792 --> 32:43.761
Let the Warlock Lord train you.
He can make you more powerful.

32:43.796 --> 32:46.096
And lose my soul in the process,
like you?

32:46.799 --> 32:48.065
I think I'll pass.

33:13.592 --> 33:16.026
Last chance. What do you choose?

34:24.864 --> 34:26.530
I'm so sorry.

34:28.900 --> 34:30.266
He helped raise me.

34:31.937 --> 34:33.337
He never let me down.

34:39.210 --> 34:40.878
This is how I repay him?

34:42.882 --> 34:44.547
You did everything you could.

34:45.431 --> 34:47.380
Flick knew exactly what he was doing.

34:47.789 --> 34:49.717
It was his choice.

34:50.101 --> 34:52.156
He didn't want you to have to
shoulder that burden.

34:53.092 --> 34:54.458
Yet here we are.

35:00.833 --> 35:03.667
We need to talk about your visions,

35:03.702 --> 35:05.903
when you were fighting Bandon.

35:07.773 --> 35:11.275
How many times do I have to tell you?
Stay out of my mind.

35:12.244 --> 35:14.711
This is not only your truth, Wil.

35:15.581 --> 35:17.314
It will affect all of us.

35:21.921 --> 35:23.420
For the greater good.

35:24.056 --> 35:25.889
I know.

35:25.925 --> 35:28.358
What you saw in that was important.

35:29.628 --> 35:30.794
Allanon.

35:38.437 --> 35:40.904
He's been cut by
the Warlock Lord's blade.

37:17.995 --> 37:19.104
Shall we begin?

37:48.226 --> 37:49.492
Ander.

37:49.527 --> 37:51.193
Your reign of terror ends today, Riga.

38:32.937 --> 38:34.081
Princess!

38:46.250 --> 38:47.917
You don't deserve that crown!

39:27.892 --> 39:29.491
I'm gonna end this royal line!

39:29.527 --> 39:30.626
No!

39:52.617 --> 39:54.016
No!

39:56.954 --> 39:58.454
No!
