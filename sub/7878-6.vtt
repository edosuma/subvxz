00:40.388 --> 00:42.300
Come on, people, I want
this place to look nice.

00:42.430 --> 00:43.564
Family is coming.

00:43.631 --> 00:45.132
Francine, did you
pick up Champagne?

00:45.200 --> 00:47.434
Yeah, I just picked her up
from the bus stop.

00:47.502 --> 00:50.137
Miss Francine, did you
move the gravy boat?

00:50.205 --> 00:52.139
It's above
the microwave, dear.

00:52.207 --> 00:53.540
Klaus, you
look great.

00:53.608 --> 00:56.376
Thanks, it's just
Banana Republic.

00:56.444 --> 00:59.046
How... do I look?

00:59.113 --> 01:01.348
Steve, you know my half
brother is Native American.

01:01.416 --> 01:02.950
But we made
these in school.

01:03.017 --> 01:05.485
Those things are sacred,
like yarmulkes for the Jews

01:05.553 --> 01:08.388
or cowboy hats for ugly sluts
at music festivals.

01:08.456 --> 01:10.624
Happy Thanksgiving,
everyone.

01:10.692 --> 01:12.993
There's my
favorite nephew.

01:13.061 --> 01:15.696
Butterfly knife
and a Hustler.

01:15.763 --> 01:17.064
Thanks, Uncle Kappy.

01:17.131 --> 01:18.565
I'm not Uncle
Kappy just yet.

01:18.633 --> 01:20.067
I still have
to get drunk.

01:20.134 --> 01:21.602
Now, then, where
is the good booze

01:21.669 --> 01:23.737
that you only pull out to
show off to your half brother?

01:23.805 --> 01:25.873
I don't pull out the nice Scotch
to show off.

01:25.940 --> 01:27.641
I do it in the spirit
of the holiday

01:27.709 --> 01:29.276
to share with the ones I love.

01:29.344 --> 01:30.894
Oh, please, you have
them over every year

01:30.979 --> 01:32.746
just so you can feel
like a big shot.

01:32.814 --> 01:34.114
Roger's right, Dad.

01:34.182 --> 01:36.850
You totally get off on
how much more successful you are

01:36.918 --> 01:38.285
than your half brother.

01:38.353 --> 01:40.487
Hayley, trust me, you have
no idea what gets me off

01:40.555 --> 01:41.922
and you probably
never will.

01:41.990 --> 01:43.891
Look, Rusty and his family
have nothing.

01:43.958 --> 01:45.525
I invite them here
so they can enjoy

01:45.593 --> 01:47.527
all we've been blessed with.

01:47.595 --> 01:49.263
I might be wealthier than Rusty,

01:49.330 --> 01:51.198
but it's not like I rub it
in his face.

01:51.266 --> 01:52.699
Rusty.

01:52.767 --> 01:55.702
Hey, feel this,
it's cashmere.

01:58.106 --> 01:59.640
Thank you for having us.

01:59.707 --> 02:02.276
Sooleawa'Uha likes
to escape the desert heat,

02:02.343 --> 02:05.145
and I know Glenn looks forward
to this all the year long.

02:05.213 --> 02:06.480
I know what
that's like.

02:06.547 --> 02:08.414
I look forward to coming
here every day, too,

02:08.483 --> 02:10.883
to this big-ass house, yeah...

02:10.952 --> 02:12.386
I make money.

02:12.453 --> 02:13.654
Here you go,
Rusty.

02:13.721 --> 02:14.938
I can't believe it's
been a whole year

02:15.006 --> 02:16.173
since you've
been here.

02:16.241 --> 02:17.858
We have so much new
stuff to show you.

02:17.926 --> 02:20.060
Steve, show Glenn
your new X-Cube.

02:20.128 --> 02:22.829
The "X" is
for "x-pensive."

02:25.099 --> 02:26.667
Look at those graphics

02:26.734 --> 02:29.169
on that high-def,
no-glare screen.

02:29.237 --> 02:30.837
You can even shine
a flashlight on it.

02:30.905 --> 02:32.105
See, no glare.

02:32.173 --> 02:34.041
And you should see the
blacks on this thing.

02:34.108 --> 02:35.809
Steve, pop in <i>The</i>
<i>Nutty Professor.</i>

02:35.877 --> 02:38.545
And check out
this flashlight-- halogen.

02:38.613 --> 02:40.380
This thing's
bright as ...

02:40.448 --> 02:44.017
The four burners allow me
to make four things at once.

02:44.085 --> 02:46.186
That's hot as ...

02:46.254 --> 02:50.123
Welcome
to the Smith house.

02:55.330 --> 02:58.098
You know, this day is
about giving thanks,

02:58.166 --> 02:59.833
and I'll tell you
what I'm thankful for--

02:59.901 --> 03:03.236
having family I get to spend
each Thanksgiving with.

03:03.271 --> 03:05.005
I'm glad
that when my dad walked

03:05.073 --> 03:06.873
into that nightclub
in Santa Fe,

03:06.941 --> 03:09.376
eyes damaged
by the New Mexican sun,

03:09.444 --> 03:11.044
he bedded
your Cherokee mother,

03:11.112 --> 03:13.513
having mistaken her
for a person.

03:15.249 --> 03:16.249
I love you, bro.

03:16.317 --> 03:18.185
You're my Thanksgiving Miracle.

03:18.252 --> 03:19.820
"Thanksgiving Miracle"?

03:19.887 --> 03:21.455
You're thinking
of "Christmas Miracle."

03:21.522 --> 03:22.489
Oh, no, Hayley.

03:22.557 --> 03:23.790
Me thinkum you forgottum

03:23.858 --> 03:25.993
the story
of the Thanksgiving Miracle.

03:26.060 --> 03:29.329
It all started at a place
called Pontiac Rock.

03:29.397 --> 03:32.199
<i>Well, the Pilgrims arrived and</i>
<i>they didn't know what to do.</i>

03:32.266 --> 03:33.734
<i>The land was all undeveloped</i>

03:33.801 --> 03:35.969
<i>because the Indians</i>
<i>hadn't done any work.</i>

03:36.037 --> 03:38.972
<i>It was all weeds,</i>
<i>no sprinklers, nothing,</i>

03:39.040 --> 03:41.241
<i>just nothing.</i>

03:41.309 --> 03:42.743
<i>They couldn't get</i>
<i>anything to grow</i>

03:42.810 --> 03:45.078
<i>or even make shelter</i>
<i>before the harsh winter came.</i>

03:50.118 --> 03:54.321
<i>In the Pilgrims' darkest hour,</i>
<i>when all was lost...</i>

03:54.389 --> 03:56.456
<i>along came Squanto.</i>

03:58.859 --> 04:01.795
<i>The following autumn, the</i>
<i>Pilgrims invited the Indians</i>

04:01.863 --> 04:04.698
<i>to a feast to thank them</i>
<i>for all their kindness.</i>

04:04.766 --> 04:07.167
<i>The feast was the perfect</i>
<i>opportunity for the Pilgrims</i>

04:07.235 --> 04:09.803
<i>to try out</i>
<i>their new exploding corn.</i>

04:14.942 --> 04:18.060
<i>Our forefathers took</i>
<i>their land...</i>

04:18.146 --> 04:20.814
<i>and it was good.</i>

04:22.950 --> 04:24.851
And now how about
a Champagne toast?

04:24.919 --> 04:26.653
To the Smiths.

04:26.721 --> 04:29.189
They gave me
their old curtains.

04:32.026 --> 04:34.261
I can't wait to see the
look on my brother's face

04:34.328 --> 04:36.763
when he sees these Manolo
Blahniks I got for the turkey.

04:36.831 --> 04:41.802
Oh, Stan, our first Thanksgiving
since Hayley ran off with Jeff.

04:41.869 --> 04:45.172
It just won't be the same
without our little girl.

04:45.239 --> 04:48.041
There is still a week.

04:48.109 --> 04:49.643
Maybe they'll come back.

04:49.710 --> 04:51.678
She's not coming back, Francine.

04:51.746 --> 04:54.181
In fact, she's dead to me
for marrying that loser.

04:54.248 --> 04:55.182
Stan.

04:59.020 --> 05:01.354
Yep, yep, we got some HVAC
running through here.

05:01.422 --> 05:02.722
Steve, what are you doing?!

05:02.790 --> 05:04.357
Expanding my room.

05:04.425 --> 05:07.194
I'm an only child now,
so I get anything I want.

05:07.261 --> 05:10.230
You have to do whatever I say
because I'm all you got.

05:10.298 --> 05:11.465
And I want

05:11.532 --> 05:13.033
a bigger room!

05:13.101 --> 05:14.568
I want a closet
like Big made

05:14.635 --> 05:16.336
for Carrie
in <i>Sex and the City.</i>

05:16.404 --> 05:17.871
I want a Labradoodle

05:17.939 --> 05:20.841
and a nice camera
to take pictures of us!

05:20.908 --> 05:22.876
Steven, you are
out of control, mister.

05:22.944 --> 05:24.411
You'd better not
behave this way

05:24.479 --> 05:25.846
when Rusty and his
family get here.

05:25.913 --> 05:27.647
If anyone has the right
to complain, it's them.

05:27.715 --> 05:28.815
They don't have squat.

05:28.883 --> 05:31.051
You know what?
For Thanksgiving this year,

05:31.119 --> 05:32.686
we're not going
to have them come here.

05:32.753 --> 05:35.422
We're going to their gross
tepee in Crap-hole, Arizona.

05:35.490 --> 05:37.023
Then you'll see
how good you've got it.

05:37.091 --> 05:38.258
What?!

05:38.326 --> 05:39.392
You heard me,
and then we're going

05:39.460 --> 05:40.694
to Four Corners,
where you'll get

05:40.761 --> 05:42.596
to see me break-dance
in four states at once!

05:42.663 --> 05:44.531
Ahh, man!

05:47.668 --> 05:50.470
We're going to spend
a whole week here?

05:50.538 --> 05:54.875
Aah, I didn't bring enough
batteries for all my stuff.

05:54.942 --> 05:55.876
Rusty.

05:55.943 --> 05:57.144
Sorry about the elk.

05:57.211 --> 05:59.045
I found him on the
side of the road.

05:59.113 --> 06:01.047
You Indians really don't waste
a thing, do you?

06:01.115 --> 06:04.050
Except for time reading
the fine print on treaties.

06:05.219 --> 06:07.420
Hop in, guys.

06:07.488 --> 06:08.588
I call antlers
up the butt.

06:08.656 --> 06:10.156
Mine, called it.

06:14.328 --> 06:16.263
You... live here?

06:16.330 --> 06:17.397
I do.

06:17.465 --> 06:19.432
This is what Steve
needs to see.

06:19.500 --> 06:21.501
Come on, let's get settled.

06:22.637 --> 06:24.070
Stan, where are you going?

06:24.138 --> 06:26.573
That is the pump house
for the fountains and pools.

06:26.641 --> 06:28.175
Fountains and pools?

06:28.242 --> 06:29.609
Well, so, then,
where do you live?

06:29.677 --> 06:30.877
Up there.

06:34.582 --> 06:36.349
That's your house?

06:36.417 --> 06:38.585
Well, actually,
it is a replica

06:38.653 --> 06:40.420
of Augustus Caesar's
summer house

06:40.488 --> 06:42.355
built into the cliffs
of Cyprus.

06:42.423 --> 06:45.625
But yes, that is
the long way of saying yes.

06:45.693 --> 06:48.695
So...

06:48.763 --> 06:51.498
we're the
poor family.

06:51.566 --> 06:55.035
Whoa, somebody
just got cuter.

06:59.611 --> 07:01.412
Some tepee
you got here, Russ.

07:01.463 --> 07:03.497
The home was a
labor of love.

07:03.582 --> 07:05.116
We built it into
the mountainside

07:05.183 --> 07:06.350
so as to
not obstruct

07:06.418 --> 07:09.153
the natural order
of the landscape.

07:11.000 --> 07:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:24.770 --> 07:27.571
I bragged
about our four burners.

07:27.639 --> 07:29.340
How many burners
do you have?

07:29.407 --> 07:30.374
I never counted.

07:30.442 --> 07:33.844
Hmm... 86?

07:33.912 --> 07:37.014
Whoo, that's a lot of burners!

07:37.082 --> 07:39.049
Glenn, I think
Steve might enjoy

07:39.117 --> 07:41.986
to see your
gaming space.

07:42.053 --> 07:44.455
This place is crazy.

07:48.193 --> 07:52.163
Do we really have to wear
these to play video games?

07:52.230 --> 07:53.330
It's amazing
how this skintight suit

07:53.398 --> 07:54.598
doesn't show a boner

07:54.666 --> 07:57.401
even though I'm certain
we both have one, right?

08:01.206 --> 08:04.508
I just want you to know
I'm having a wonderful time.

08:07.712 --> 08:09.547
Power on!

08:15.587 --> 08:16.520
Where are the remotes?!

08:16.588 --> 08:18.556
We are the remotes!

08:25.130 --> 08:27.865
My whole body's a joystick!

08:40.846 --> 08:44.248
This bar has
absolutely everything.

08:44.316 --> 08:48.419
Oh, my God, Absolute Everything.

08:48.486 --> 08:49.553
That bathroom
is amazing.

08:49.621 --> 08:51.155
A gold toilet?

08:51.223 --> 08:52.790
And I can't believe
you have a servant

08:52.858 --> 08:53.991
just to wipe
your butt.

08:54.059 --> 08:55.693
Um, I don't.

08:55.760 --> 08:57.761
Oh, explains
the attitude

08:57.829 --> 09:00.898
and why he did
such a slapdash job.

09:00.966 --> 09:04.401
Rusty, I, I always
thought you were poor.

09:04.469 --> 09:05.936
I-I actually
brought Steve here

09:06.004 --> 09:07.805
to try to make him
appreciate what he has.

09:09.207 --> 09:11.375
That is truly funny

09:11.443 --> 09:13.510
because I have been bringing
my family to your house

09:13.578 --> 09:14.812
every Thanksgiving
for the same reason.

09:29.802 --> 09:31.657
How did you
get so rich?

09:31.778 --> 09:33.812
It is the land.

09:33.880 --> 09:37.516
I pull $18 million
of copper

09:37.584 --> 09:40.519
out of the ground
every year!

09:40.587 --> 09:43.389
This land, the land
you got from Grandpa?

09:43.456 --> 09:45.991
Wer-Weren't we supposed
to share this land?

09:46.059 --> 09:49.028
You two ... are
my only grandchildren.

09:49.095 --> 09:52.698
All I got to my ... name
is $20,000

09:52.766 --> 09:56.335
and a piece of ... land
your sissy great grandpappy

09:56.403 --> 10:00.072
won in a game of kickball
against some ...

10:13.887 --> 10:18.090
So you two ... decide
who gets what:

10:18.158 --> 10:21.093
the sweet 20 grand

10:21.161 --> 10:23.329
or the crap land.

10:23.396 --> 10:25.064
Rusty, we both clearly
want the money,

10:25.131 --> 10:26.532
so here's
what we'll do.

10:26.599 --> 10:28.300
I'll hold a number
behind my back.

10:28.368 --> 10:30.436
If you choose correctly,
then you can take the money.

10:30.503 --> 10:31.737
Okay.

10:31.805 --> 10:32.738
Two.

10:32.806 --> 10:33.739
Nope, 11.

10:33.807 --> 10:34.840
I get the money.

10:35.909 --> 10:37.409
Peace, I'm
out of here.

10:37.477 --> 10:40.546
Yo, can I get two Jell-Os
for me and my gramps?

10:40.613 --> 10:42.181
You tricked me!

10:42.248 --> 10:44.283
Stan, you inherited $20,000.

10:44.351 --> 10:45.918
What did you do with it?
