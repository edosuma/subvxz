00:01.335 --> 00:02.916
( bluesy techno music plays)

00:03.004 --> 00:05.040
How can you say that?

00:05.131 --> 00:09.215
Because it's true.
You're exactly like a Sebacean.

00:09.302 --> 00:11.258
In what way am I
like a Sebacean?

00:11.345 --> 00:13.927
In that you think that
you are superior,

00:14.015 --> 00:16.506
and that you treat the rest
of us like animals.

00:16.601 --> 00:19.058
When have I ever treated
you like that?

00:19.145 --> 00:20.806
Only every time we have
to make a decision

00:20.897 --> 00:23.889
and you think that the best
idea is your idea.

00:28.279 --> 00:32.238
Oh, yeah. They are going to
write songs about how you guys
tore this place up.

00:32.325 --> 00:33.861
Right. Go away.

00:33.951 --> 00:36.328
I am away. I'm on vacation!

00:36.412 --> 00:38.323
Pip, beat it.

00:38.414 --> 00:42.123
Has it occurred to you why
Pilot banished you from Moya?

00:44.086 --> 00:47.749
No. Because you're both acting
like a couple of immature
trijnotsl

00:47.840 --> 00:49.080
I can't believe you
pissed him off.

00:49.175 --> 00:50.255
ldidn't piss him off.
You pissed him off.

00:50.343 --> 00:52.334
You did.
-Grow up.

00:52.428 --> 00:55.420
Or ignore each other, or kill
each other. Butjust stop
fighting all the time.

00:57.016 --> 00:59.052
I'm out of currency.

00:59.143 --> 01:00.428
Crichton:
Here.

01:00.519 --> 01:02.601
Playland for the rich
too classy for ya?

01:02.688 --> 01:06.476
( slurring ):
Effervescent spirits costs
more than cheap raslak.

01:06.567 --> 01:12.062
But you... you just keep on
hunting for that long-range
cargo hauler of your dreams,

01:12.156 --> 01:14.613
'cause he's bound to throw up
in your lap one day.

01:16.369 --> 01:19.452
When she passes out, I'll...
I'll take it back to Moya.

01:19.538 --> 01:23.201
In the meantime,
I'm gonna have some fun.

01:25.419 --> 01:27.080
| suggest you guys do the same.

01:29.340 --> 01:30.250
See what you did?

01:30.341 --> 01:31.501
You did it.
-You did.

01:33.386 --> 01:35.126
You.
-You. Yeah, right, you did it.

01:44.355 --> 01:46.095
Crichton:
This alien is Raxil.

01:46.190 --> 01:48.647
There's one like her
on every planet.

01:54.282 --> 01:59.242
And these girls... well...
we never did get their names.

02:00.788 --> 02:02.153
Ah...

02:03.332 --> 02:05.197
Are you boys... a couple?

02:05.293 --> 02:06.123
Hal

02:06.210 --> 02:07.325
( snickers )

02:07.420 --> 02:08.125
No!

02:08.212 --> 02:08.746
No.

02:08.838 --> 02:10.248
No-nol
-No.

02:10.339 --> 02:13.706
Can you handle some girls
looking to party-party-party?

02:13.801 --> 02:16.838
I am a full-blooded Luxan.

02:16.929 --> 02:22.014
And ladies, I have so much cash
in my pocket that I can assure
you that the three of us

02:22.101 --> 02:25.309
will be out of here on our
hands and knees come sunrise
tomorrow morning.

02:25.396 --> 02:31.107
D'Argo:
I've been arrested for saying
exactly the same thing on four different planets.

02:31.193 --> 02:33.149
(funky jazz plays)

02:35.364 --> 02:36.900
( D'Argo growls )

02:39.702 --> 02:40.487
( hisses )

02:43.914 --> 02:44.824
Whoa!

02:56.802 --> 02:58.303
Crichton:
Fe'Tor.

02:58.387 --> 03:00.719
Bad guy. Dressed in black.

03:06.729 --> 03:10.017
Another bad guy,
the guy with Fe'Tor.

03:18.157 --> 03:19.897
(blows landing)

03:21.660 --> 03:22.991
D'Argo:
Crichton!

03:23.079 --> 03:24.364
Crichton, wake up.

03:24.455 --> 03:26.286
Wake up!

03:26.374 --> 03:27.238
Crichton!

03:27.333 --> 03:28.664
( groaning ):
What happened?

03:28.751 --> 03:30.537
What didn't happen?

03:30.628 --> 03:33.335
Oh God, there were girls, right?

03:33.422 --> 03:34.502
( blowing softly)

03:34.590 --> 03:37.127
Feathered chicks.
The rainbow coalition.

03:37.218 --> 03:39.209
Girls, breasts, blue breasts,
green breasts.

03:39.303 --> 03:41.134
ldon't know. All I know is...

03:41.222 --> 03:43.304
they spiked our drinks
and took our money.

03:43.391 --> 03:44.506
They rolled us?

03:44.600 --> 03:46.431
Yeah, they rolled us.
You know these...

03:46.519 --> 03:48.885
My pulse pistol!
-shots that we took,
they spiked 'em.

03:48.979 --> 03:52.221
My pulse pistol. They took
my damn pulse pistol!

03:52.316 --> 03:53.772
No one stole your pulse pistol.

03:53.859 --> 03:55.645
We're on LoMo.
No weapons allowed.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.476
Your pulse pistol's on
the Transporter Pod.

03:57.571 --> 03:58.947
I don't remember that.

03:59.031 --> 04:00.237
( groans )

04:00.324 --> 04:02.781
Where are my boots?

04:03.869 --> 04:05.200
(sighs)

04:05.287 --> 04:06.868
(people laughing, talking)

04:06.956 --> 04:08.287
2.222%. a? 23/7 32
f f: 32 iii 3?: :2.
A:¢:’,¢¢>¢.
3:72.4ng

04:08.374 --> 04:09.830
Oh!

04:10.418 --> 04:11.658
Whoa! Ho, ho!

04:11.752 --> 04:13.288
D'Argo...

04:13.379 --> 04:15.620
we're in a window.

04:15.714 --> 04:18.000
There are people watching.

04:18.092 --> 04:20.128
Uh-huh.

04:20.219 --> 04:22.505
D'Argo:
I think they've been there for
about seven arns, so...

04:22.596 --> 04:25.303
why don't you just get dressed
and give them a good show,
sweetheart?

04:25.391 --> 04:27.382
I am dressed.

04:28.394 --> 04:30.259
( screaming )

04:34.442 --> 04:35.773
( snickers )

04:39.738 --> 04:42.115
My name is John Crichton...
I'm lost...
an astronaut.

04:42.199 --> 04:46.158
I got shot through
a wormhole...
In some distant part of the universe...

04:46.245 --> 04:47.576
I'm trying to stay alive...

04:47.663 --> 04:49.619
Aboard this ship...
This living ship...

04:49.707 --> 04:52.414
Of escaped prisoners.
My friends.

04:52.501 --> 04:54.207
If you can hear me...
Beware.

04:54.295 --> 04:56.286
lfl make it back...
Will they follow?

04:56.380 --> 04:58.837
If I open the door...
Are you ready?

04:58.924 --> 05:03.384
Earth is unprepared...
Helpless,
for the nightmares I've seen.

05:03.471 --> 05:05.803
Or should I stay...
Protect my home...

05:05.890 --> 05:08.347
Not show them...
You exist...

05:08.434 --> 05:12.393
But then you will never know
the wonders I've seen.

05:43.594 --> 05:49.009
Pilot:
I said ten solar days away from
Moya, and I meant ten.

05:49.099 --> 05:51.306
Pilot, give me a break.
I'm trying to tell you
what happened.

05:51.393 --> 05:53.258
I understand, Crichton.

05:53.354 --> 05:58.098
However, my inclination is not
to accept any explanation.

05:58.192 --> 06:00.274
Well, I can't go
back down there.

06:00.361 --> 06:01.942
I'm persona non grata on LoMo.

06:02.029 --> 06:04.441
LoMo non grata. Can't do it.
Not going. Uh-uh.

06:04.532 --> 06:10.402
You return beat up, inebriated
and broke after only two.

06:10.496 --> 06:12.282
Yeah.

06:12.373 --> 06:14.238
But that's what I'm trying
to explain to you.

06:14.333 --> 06:16.289
You said if! could explain it
then I... I could stay on
board, right?

06:16.377 --> 06:18.743
( inhales deeply)

06:19.255 --> 06:21.211
Proceed.

06:21.298 --> 06:23.289
( Doo, shoo-bop music)

06:29.682 --> 06:32.469
Crichton:
How the hell did we end up
in that window?

06:32.560 --> 06:33.390
I don't know.

06:33.477 --> 06:35.058
You don't think we, uh...

06:35.145 --> 06:36.726
I said, I don't know!

06:36.814 --> 06:39.180
Hey, don't... don't yell.
It hurts.

06:39.275 --> 06:41.140
Have we heard from Jool
or Pip yet?

06:41.235 --> 06:43.271
They haven't been answering
their comms.

06:43.362 --> 06:45.978
Right, go find 'em, Lassie.
It was your idea to come down
here in the first place.

06:46.073 --> 06:48.234
You go frelling find them.
Aren't you worried about them?

06:48.325 --> 06:52.659
Ah, hell, no. They're probably
sleeping off the fun they
had last night.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.202
Shut up.
-Hey, don't tell me to shut up.

06:54.290 --> 06:56.326
You know, you're the one who
told her to have fun.

06:56.417 --> 06:58.373
What do you think "fun" is
for Chiana? What?
-Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, shut up, shut up.

06:58.460 --> 07:00.951
Isn't that the pile of dren we
saw outside the window?

07:01.046 --> 07:04.038
Yeah. Smile.

07:04.133 --> 07:06.419
She was also in the bar last
night, wasn't she?

07:09.221 --> 07:10.631
(giggling)

07:12.558 --> 07:14.139
I'm so glad you're not
angry, you know.

07:14.226 --> 07:15.511
I thought you were gonna... oh!

07:15.603 --> 07:16.843
What are you going to do?!
I'm going to scream!

07:16.937 --> 07:18.268
( shrieks )
No, don't scream.

07:18.355 --> 07:20.562
Did you steal our currency?

07:20.649 --> 07:22.765
What you talkin' about?
I didn't steal anything.

07:22.860 --> 07:24.566
I came over here to
talk to you.

07:24.653 --> 07:27.030
You know? But you looked so
angry before, when you
were in the window.

07:27.114 --> 07:27.978
( screaming )

07:28.073 --> 07:29.688
Not talking about the window!

07:29.783 --> 07:32.525
Alright. Lemme give you
something here. I saw it all.
They're in trouble.

07:32.620 --> 07:34.861
Yeah, they're gonna be in a lot
more trouble when I find them.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.365
The green and the blue chick...

07:36.457 --> 07:38.322
Not the blue and green chick.
No, no, no.

07:38.417 --> 07:39.998
I'm talking about your females.

07:40.085 --> 07:43.248
I'm talking about the pretty
gray one and the really
annoying gold one.

07:43.339 --> 07:44.294
What about them?

07:44.381 --> 07:46.121
They're in trouble.
I can show you.

07:46.216 --> 07:48.127
I can show ya what happened
last night. Lemme go.

07:48.218 --> 07:51.210
D'Argo, look. Chiana knows how
to look after herself.

07:51.305 --> 07:55.969
We got to find our money and
I'm pretty sure that this
grommet is involved.

07:56.060 --> 07:57.641
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

07:57.728 --> 07:59.184
I got something for ya.

07:59.271 --> 08:01.808
I got us a recording of all
that happened last night.

08:01.899 --> 08:04.436
I mean, you don't believe it,
you can see it for yourselves,
you know?

08:04.526 --> 08:06.107
It's talking crap.

08:06.195 --> 08:07.810
We got rolled, and I don't
think we need...

08:07.905 --> 08:10.146
You're broke. You can't
get robbed again.

08:10.240 --> 08:12.902
I mean, what do you think,
you think I want your shoes?

08:14.161 --> 08:15.867
I don't know what you want.

08:15.954 --> 08:17.785
You're not very smart, are ya?

08:17.873 --> 08:19.829
Now he, he's got a brain.

08:19.917 --> 08:21.703
But you, you're a bit
of an idiot.

08:21.794 --> 08:24.126
Huh?-Huh?-Huh?

08:24.213 --> 08:24.872
Yeah.

08:24.963 --> 08:26.339
Yeah.
-But I'm bigger.

08:26.423 --> 08:28.163
Ow, ow! All right, sorry,
sorry, sorry.

08:28.258 --> 08:30.965
All right, all right, have you
spoken to your females yet?

08:31.053 --> 08:32.964
I bet you haven't spoken
to them yet. Have ya.

08:33.055 --> 08:34.795
No, we haven't spoken to them
'cause they might be sleeping.

08:34.890 --> 08:36.471
They could be...
-Oh yeah, princess.

08:36.558 --> 08:39.550
How do I know you haven't
spoken to them yet? Huh?

08:39.645 --> 08:41.852
You don't know that, do ya? No.

08:41.939 --> 08:44.521
Well, my point is...
-Will you just tell us?

08:44.608 --> 08:46.144
Tah-dah!

08:46.235 --> 08:48.351
That's Jool's comm.
-How you know?

08:48.445 --> 08:51.653
It's melted around the edges
from when she screams.
( screams )

08:51.740 --> 08:55.324
Now, do you wanna see what
happened last night or not?

08:55.411 --> 08:58.949
'Cause I could just,
you know, not.

08:59.039 --> 09:00.825
All right, all right, you don't
have to push me.

09:00.916 --> 09:03.202
The point is, you see, we can
be friends. You can trust me,
ya see?

09:03.293 --> 09:06.205
Everybody trusts me, 'cause I'm
a female of my word.

09:06.296 --> 09:07.331
Oh, what is that?!

09:07.423 --> 09:08.629
It smells like...

09:08.716 --> 09:10.422
Shh, shh, shh. Close but no.

09:10.509 --> 09:12.465
It's... it's merimar root,
ya know?

09:12.553 --> 09:14.965
Kabaah uses it in all his
pleasure elixirs.

09:15.055 --> 09:17.512
Very low quality, but we
don't tell him that.

09:17.599 --> 09:20.011
Mr. Kabaah? Mr. Kabaah?

09:20.102 --> 09:21.137
Wake up!

09:21.228 --> 09:22.343
Don't yell.

09:22.438 --> 09:26.147
Well, I have to. He's as deaf
as a bubba. Wake up!

09:26.233 --> 09:27.473
Go away.

09:27.568 --> 09:30.105
I don't need your trouble.
-Trouble?!

09:30.195 --> 09:33.153
Me? No, no, no, you must have
me confused with someone else.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.401
I'm not confused.

09:35.492 --> 09:40.327
I've seen you snooping around,
seen you when you didn't
want me to.

09:40.414 --> 09:41.403
Ooh...

09:42.040 --> 09:44.122
Is that a Hangi?

09:44.209 --> 09:45.369
A Hangi?

09:45.461 --> 09:47.577
I don't believe you.

09:47.671 --> 09:48.535
What's a Hangi?

09:48.630 --> 09:50.166
Creature with removal eyes.

09:50.257 --> 09:53.499
Optic nerves that continue to
record and send back images

09:53.594 --> 09:55.960
even after they're separated
from the body.

09:56.054 --> 09:57.885
Leave 'em in somebody's
bed chamber...

09:57.973 --> 09:59.429
(goofy laughter)

09:59.516 --> 10:02.053
You brought us to see
a pornographer?

10:02.144 --> 10:04.385
I'm deaf, not dead.

10:04.480 --> 10:07.017
Stop talking like I'm not here.

10:07.107 --> 10:08.938
What do you want?

10:09.026 --> 10:12.484
I know you've always got an eye
hanging out at the LoMo Bar.

10:13.322 --> 10:14.277
So?

10:14.364 --> 10:17.197
We're looking for a Nebari
and an Interion.

10:18.535 --> 10:20.821
You want the show?

10:21.747 --> 10:23.078
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

10:23.165 --> 10:24.780
Who's paying?

10:24.875 --> 10:28.959
You don't think you get the
show for free, do you?

10:29.046 --> 10:31.662
D'Argo:
We have no currency.
You know that.

10:31.757 --> 10:33.167
Come on, you gotta have
something.

10:33.258 --> 10:35.544
All right, then, you know what?
We are being scammed.

10:35.636 --> 10:38.252
Ren and Stimpy here are
teaming up to rip us off.

10:38.347 --> 10:39.177
Let's get out of here.

10:39.264 --> 10:41.175
This fannix?

10:41.266 --> 10:43.097
I would never team up with her.

10:43.185 --> 10:46.677
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Just to prove to you, I'll pay.

10:46.772 --> 10:48.137
There!

10:49.274 --> 10:51.230
Where did you get that currency?
-Why, what's the matter?

10:51.318 --> 10:54.276
All of our brandaar tiles
were stolen last night.

10:54.363 --> 10:56.069
S0? Do you have your
name on 'em?

10:56.156 --> 10:58.693
No. No. They aren't yours.
They're mine. They're mine.

10:58.784 --> 11:02.117
You two have really got to
work on your attitude,
you know that?

11:02.204 --> 11:03.660
Kabaah, give them a tentacle.

11:03.747 --> 11:06.284
Put one of these on your eye.

11:06.375 --> 11:07.615
You gotta be kidding me.

11:07.709 --> 11:11.418
These will link back to the
optic memory of last night

11:11.505 --> 11:16.374
and act as a three-dimensional
image of everything that
happened in the bar.

11:16.468 --> 11:18.174
You want us...

11:18.262 --> 11:20.878
to put one of your tentacles...

11:20.973 --> 11:21.928
in our eye?

11:22.015 --> 11:23.346
Don't be such a grimmat.

11:23.433 --> 11:25.890
( groans )
Just do it!

11:28.230 --> 11:30.516
( D'Argo stammering )

11:32.609 --> 11:33.860
Ooh!

11:34.278 --> 11:35.313
Ooh...

11:35.404 --> 11:37.486
(raucous laughter)

11:41.201 --> 11:43.943
This is, uh... this is...

11:44.037 --> 11:46.119
D'Argo, y-you seeing this?
This is, um...

11:46.206 --> 11:49.573
D'Argo:
Well, it's, um...
it's incredible.

11:51.420 --> 11:53.627
Kabaah, show us the females.

11:55.716 --> 11:57.957
(techno music playing )

12:00.929 --> 12:03.011
Oh, hello.

12:04.850 --> 12:06.841
Don't give me that.

12:06.935 --> 12:08.721
You're jealous.

12:08.812 --> 12:10.723
All right.

12:10.814 --> 12:13.305
Yeah, this looks really
dangerous.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.186
Those girls are in fear
for their lives.

12:15.277 --> 12:17.142
Yep, all right, have you
got anything else?

12:17.237 --> 12:21.196
Kabaah, get your eye out of the
gutter. Show them later. Later!

12:25.537 --> 12:28.324
( percussive dance music
playing )

12:28.415 --> 12:29.780
( cheering )

12:37.466 --> 12:38.205
That it?

12:38.300 --> 12:39.255
Yeah.

12:41.094 --> 12:42.345
You.

12:43.555 --> 12:45.056
What, me?

12:54.650 --> 12:55.981
Watch.

13:29.351 --> 13:31.182
Ooh!

13:34.147 --> 13:35.808
I just won a bet.

13:35.899 --> 13:38.481
Raslak. Make it a large.

13:42.322 --> 13:44.358
( sniffs )

13:44.449 --> 13:46.906
You smell so exotic.

13:48.704 --> 13:51.036
I like watching you dance.

13:51.123 --> 13:54.456
I like watching you and your
friend, but especially...

13:54.543 --> 13:56.204
( D'Argo growls )
you!
-Ooh!

13:56.294 --> 13:59.081
Oh, big deal. She's been
hit on by some guy.

13:59.172 --> 14:01.629
Knowing Chi, he's probably
more trouble than she is.

14:01.717 --> 14:03.253
Wait, there's more.

14:03.343 --> 14:05.584
I have something for you.

14:08.432 --> 14:11.424
(music slows)

14:12.019 --> 14:14.260
You.

14:15.355 --> 14:17.812
I like the look of you.

14:17.899 --> 14:20.276
( D'Argo hisses)

14:22.070 --> 14:23.480
Who is this bastard?

14:23.572 --> 14:24.687
That's Fe'Tor.

14:24.781 --> 14:25.941
( loud crack )
Ow!

14:26.033 --> 14:27.113
Ow! Whoa!

14:27.200 --> 14:29.282
Whoa! What the hell
just happened?!

14:29.369 --> 14:32.702
You didn't pay me enough
to cross Fe'Tor.

14:32.789 --> 14:33.778
Who is Fe'Tor?

14:33.874 --> 14:35.410
He was what I was trying
to show ya.

14:35.500 --> 14:37.786
Fe'Tor's the most famous
kasnik around here.

14:37.878 --> 14:40.335
He rounds up the
good-looking ones

14:40.422 --> 14:43.414
and they all just party, night
and day, night and day.

14:45.302 --> 14:46.883
What, does he... do them?

14:46.970 --> 14:48.506
He hurts them.

14:48.597 --> 14:49.757
He gives them the whiff.

14:49.848 --> 14:51.884
Well, you saw. And then
they do anything.

14:51.975 --> 14:54.307
(liquid gurgling)

14:59.733 --> 15:03.601
Crichton:
I'm not sure, but I think
this is Fe'Tor's sister.

15:04.571 --> 15:06.778
Her Freslin is still adequate.

15:06.865 --> 15:09.823
I'm not interested in...

15:10.702 --> 15:11.942
adequate.

15:12.037 --> 15:13.652
We gotta get your females
out of there.

15:13.747 --> 15:15.032
Do you know where we
can find them?

15:15.123 --> 15:16.329
Yeah, got an idea.

15:16.416 --> 15:17.792
Whoa, hey, whoa.
D'Argo, D'Argo, wait.

15:17.876 --> 15:20.333
What we saw is from last night.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.206
Chiana could not even be
with that guy anymore.

15:22.297 --> 15:24.538
We can't have another
auction yet.

15:24.633 --> 15:26.123
It's too soon.

15:26.218 --> 15:27.298
Too dangerous.

15:27.385 --> 15:30.468
I think our female upstairs
might be exceptional.

15:31.264 --> 15:33.095
For her, we can risk it.

15:33.183 --> 15:36.675
D'Argo, who are you believing
this Raxil thing here?

15:36.770 --> 15:38.226
Chiana was having fun.

15:38.313 --> 15:40.895
She could be walking back into
the bar right now.
We don't know.

15:40.982 --> 15:42.847
Why don't you go to the bar
and wait for her?

15:42.943 --> 15:45.309
D'Argo, I...
-It's fine.

15:45.403 --> 15:49.271
I'm just going to go along
and say... hello.

15:50.408 --> 15:52.239
( power hum increases )

15:55.831 --> 15:57.787
Squeeze her dry.

16:04.714 --> 16:06.705
I've been comming the girls.

16:06.800 --> 16:08.290
No answer. You find 'em?

16:08.385 --> 16:09.716
Found them.

16:16.601 --> 16:18.057
Deliveries around the back.

16:18.145 --> 16:19.260
Oh. Oh, around the back?

16:19.354 --> 16:21.094
Egg/V"

16:21.189 --> 16:22.770
Okay, thanks.

16:24.317 --> 16:26.182
They okay?

16:26.278 --> 16:27.063
They're fine.

16:27.154 --> 16:28.519
(shrill shrieking)

16:32.367 --> 16:34.403
(Jool laughing)

16:34.494 --> 16:36.030
Jool! Jool!

16:36.121 --> 16:37.156
(Jool gasping)

16:37.247 --> 16:39.033
Are you all right?

16:39.124 --> 16:40.204
Oh, D'Argo.

16:40.292 --> 16:42.248
Oh. Come in with me.

16:42.335 --> 16:45.168
Come on.
-Where is Chiana?

16:45.255 --> 16:46.870
Over there.

16:49.092 --> 16:49.956
Hey.

16:50.051 --> 16:51.177
(giggles )

16:51.261 --> 16:53.547
Um, uh...

16:53.638 --> 16:56.254
We thought that perhaps you
might be in some trouble.

16:56.349 --> 16:58.340
I'm not in any trouble.

16:58.435 --> 17:00.266
At least none I don't
wanna be in.

17:00.353 --> 17:02.935
Where's Raxil? She didn't wait
around like she said she would.

17:03.023 --> 17:04.183
That way.

17:04.274 --> 17:05.559
Raxil:
Oh, oh, did you see them?

17:05.650 --> 17:07.732
Are they in trouble?
-They were taking a bath.

17:07.819 --> 17:09.935
( laughter)

17:11.406 --> 17:12.691
I, uh...

17:12.782 --> 17:14.033
Mmm...

17:14.117 --> 17:17.029
( quietly):
We saw him give you something.

17:17.120 --> 17:19.327
Some stuff.

17:19.414 --> 17:22.201
( quietly):
Oh. Were you spying on me?

17:22.292 --> 17:23.372
No. No.

17:23.460 --> 17:26.623
D'Argo, I came here to
have a good time.

17:26.713 --> 17:28.374
Does that make you jealous?

17:28.465 --> 17:30.456
No, I'm not jealous.
It's just that...

17:30.550 --> 17:33.383
'Cause you and me, we're...
we're not together
anymore, are we?

17:33.470 --> 17:36.337
No, we're not together
anymore, but...

17:36.431 --> 17:37.841
Oh well, then let go of me.

17:37.933 --> 17:39.218
(giggling)

17:39.309 --> 17:41.846
All right. You and Jool are
coming with me.

17:41.937 --> 17:43.768
Let me go!

17:43.855 --> 17:45.311
( squealing )
-Chiana, are you all right?

17:45.398 --> 17:46.558
D'Argo:
She's fine.

17:46.650 --> 17:48.265
Why don't you let go
of her then?

17:48.360 --> 17:50.601
Why don't you mind your own
business, you miserable
little tralk.

17:50.695 --> 17:52.356
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
whoa, whoa, whoa...

17:52.447 --> 17:54.654
They had weapons.

17:54.741 --> 17:58.074
You said it would be a party.

17:58.161 --> 18:01.244
But they had weapons that
they put to my head.

18:01.331 --> 18:03.117
They had weapons?

18:03.208 --> 18:05.164
Yes, but they weren't
pointed at Chiana.

18:05.252 --> 18:06.332
They were pointed at me.

18:06.419 --> 18:09.286
Fe'Tor:
Please, please.

18:09.381 --> 18:11.167
Calm yourself.

18:11.258 --> 18:13.123
I don't like to show force,

18:13.218 --> 18:17.336
but you are in my residence and
you are attacking my people.

18:17.430 --> 18:19.216
Now get out.

18:20.934 --> 18:22.344
Chiana.

18:23.186 --> 18:25.268
D'Argo, get out.

18:25.355 --> 18:26.344
Go!

18:28.858 --> 18:30.394
( breathy snarl )

18:31.278 --> 18:33.018
Jool:
Oh, we're fine, D'Argo.

18:33.113 --> 18:34.353
Really. We're just...

18:34.447 --> 18:35.903
(gasps )

18:35.991 --> 18:38.232
Ah, D'Argo, you're going
to kill her.

18:38.326 --> 18:40.817
At the moment, I do not have
a problem with that.

18:40.912 --> 18:41.822
( spritzing )

18:41.913 --> 18:44.074
( screaming )

18:44.165 --> 18:45.291
What did you spray on him?

18:45.375 --> 18:46.785
Freslin.

18:46.876 --> 18:49.162
(dance music plays)

19:00.390 --> 19:02.130
Stop! Stop! Stop!

19:02.225 --> 19:03.726
This makes no sense.

19:03.810 --> 19:05.471
You make no sense.

19:05.562 --> 19:07.018
What? What doesn't make sense?

19:07.105 --> 19:09.221
She nailed him with
Love Potion Number 9.

19:09.316 --> 19:12.149
It made him dance?

19:12.235 --> 19:14.191
Well, it's a way to meet girls.

19:14.279 --> 19:16.019
Pilot, just listen to this,
all right?

19:16.114 --> 19:18.355
This is important.
This is about the deal.

19:18.450 --> 19:20.987
It's about Freslin,
LoMo's dirty little secret.

19:21.077 --> 19:27.118
I suspect the dirty little
secret is you spend all your
currency on pleasure, and now...

19:27.208 --> 19:28.869
Hey, you know what?

19:28.960 --> 19:30.666
It's a weird universe
out there, man.

19:30.754 --> 19:33.416
You don't know that cause
you're spending all your
time indoors.

19:33.506 --> 19:36.248
Just let me finish my story.

19:36.343 --> 19:38.208
(dance music playing)

19:40.722 --> 19:42.633
See? See why I made us
get off the beach?

19:42.724 --> 19:44.931
He would have been chasing
everything that moves.

19:45.018 --> 19:47.134
That's all because of this
stuff you gave him?

19:47.228 --> 19:49.264
Freslin's an attractant.

19:49.356 --> 19:51.893
You can be attractive to
someone else, or they can be
attracted to you.

19:51.983 --> 19:54.099
It could be strong,
weak, anything.

19:54.194 --> 19:55.604
Depends on where it's
manufactured.

19:55.695 --> 19:57.071
(gasping)

19:57.155 --> 20:00.272
Did you like the Freslin
I gave you last night?

20:00.367 --> 20:01.823
Is this more?

20:01.910 --> 20:03.696
Mmm. Different batch.

20:03.787 --> 20:05.869
Different quality.

20:06.373 --> 20:07.783
Want a taste?

20:10.919 --> 20:12.375
Hmm?

20:13.421 --> 20:14.627
Hmm?

20:14.714 --> 20:16.170
Bring it on.

20:22.055 --> 20:24.091
It's different.
-More bitter?

20:24.182 --> 20:25.217
Yeah.

20:25.308 --> 20:26.218
( laughs )

20:26.309 --> 20:28.345
An animal's last batch
always is.

20:28.436 --> 20:30.597
( laughs )

20:30.688 --> 20:32.974
This is, uh... this is
from an animal?

20:33.066 --> 20:34.306
Fe'Tor:
Mm-hmm.

20:34.401 --> 20:36.016
A beautiful animal.

20:36.111 --> 20:38.978
This is the same stuff that
that guy sprayed on Chiana
last night?

20:39.072 --> 20:40.903
Yeah. Grade-A Freslin.

20:40.990 --> 20:42.196
Made in his own lab.

20:42.283 --> 20:45.025
Fe'Tor's got the most sensitive
nose in the business.

20:45.120 --> 20:46.656
(gasping)

20:46.746 --> 20:48.327
What am I missing?

20:48.415 --> 20:49.530
Nothing.

20:50.291 --> 20:51.246
Here.

20:58.049 --> 20:59.459
Wonderful, isn't it?

20:59.551 --> 21:01.633
(Jool gasps with pleasure)

21:01.719 --> 21:03.255
Yeah...

21:04.389 --> 21:07.677
Now, will you do
anything for me?

21:07.767 --> 21:10.053
I'll do anything for you.

21:10.145 --> 21:11.885
(laughing)

21:11.980 --> 21:16.064
I think Fe'Tor wants your
females for more than just...
you know.

21:17.944 --> 21:20.151
What... does he want them for?

21:20.238 --> 21:21.444
No peeking.

21:21.531 --> 21:23.317
(giggisS)

21:24.409 --> 21:26.070
Can you smell it?

21:26.161 --> 21:28.823
( inhales deeply)

21:28.913 --> 21:31.120
Just breathe it in.

21:31.207 --> 21:36.372
Well, the base element of
Freslin is found in the senil
gland of sentient beings.

21:36.463 --> 21:38.203
Oh, you mean like in people?

21:38.298 --> 21:39.629
Yeah.

21:39.716 --> 21:43.334
Fe'Tor's got a machine that
milks this gland.

21:43.428 --> 21:47.421
And when there's a lot of
demand, well, sometimes he'll
milk them until they die.

21:47.515 --> 21:48.800
You'll love it.

21:48.892 --> 21:50.428
(laughing)

21:54.105 --> 21:55.891
Can I open my eyes yet?

21:55.982 --> 21:57.347
Mm-hmm.

21:57.692 --> 21:59.808
Oh!

21:59.903 --> 22:01.143
Wow!

22:01.237 --> 22:03.444
Why did you not tell us
this earlier?

22:03.531 --> 22:05.146
( D'Argo screams )

22:05.241 --> 22:06.526
( loud crash )

22:09.871 --> 22:11.532
Ah! John...

22:11.623 --> 22:15.582
these people will not
dance with me.

22:15.668 --> 22:17.829
No one wants to dance with me...
-No. Go away.

22:17.921 --> 22:18.831
Oh, oh, oh.

22:18.922 --> 22:20.128
Look at the booty on that girl.

22:20.215 --> 22:22.251
The booty?
-Whoo!

22:23.676 --> 22:25.132
Sweetie pie...

22:25.220 --> 22:28.462
I should have told you
everything but I was scared.

22:28.556 --> 22:30.217
I mean, Fe'Tor's dangerous.

22:30.308 --> 22:36.019
If Fe'Tor is so dangerous,
why help us at all?

22:36.105 --> 22:38.266
My mate, Sarl.

22:38.358 --> 22:40.815
He's with Fe'Tor.

22:40.902 --> 22:42.608
He doesn't look very well.

22:42.695 --> 22:46.028
I mean, he's tall, he's good
looking. I mean, look at me.
I'm 3 nothing.

22:46.115 --> 22:47.696
I tried to warn him, but...

22:47.784 --> 22:50.992
I'm telling you everything
because when you save
your females,

22:51.079 --> 22:52.819
I want you to save Sari.

22:56.251 --> 22:58.993
Isn't that the guy that was
with Fe'Tor last night?

22:59.087 --> 23:01.624
Raxil:
Yeah. That's Mitols,
his right hand jerk.

23:01.714 --> 23:03.796
Well, he could probably
get us in to see the girls,
couldn't he?

23:03.883 --> 23:05.589
'Course he can, but he's
never gonna to tell ya.

23:05.677 --> 23:08.214
Keep D'Argo busy.
I got some business.

23:09.556 --> 23:11.888
How you doin'?

23:11.975 --> 23:15.058
Man, were you here last night?
Was that wild or what?

23:17.105 --> 23:18.345
I drink alone.

23:18.439 --> 23:21.602
Yeah, I'm not really, uh...
interested in drinking, either.

23:21.693 --> 23:23.308
Um, I'm looking for some, uh...

23:23.403 --> 23:25.234
(whispers ):
Freslin.

23:25.321 --> 23:27.903
And I heard that you were
the guy to see.

23:27.991 --> 23:29.822
You like the Freslin?

23:37.458 --> 23:39.323
Jool:
Uh... I, uh...

23:42.338 --> 23:44.954
Trust me.

23:45.049 --> 23:46.038
( muffled screaming )

23:46.134 --> 23:48.216
It only hurts the first time.

23:51.222 --> 23:52.462
Go away.

23:53.558 --> 23:54.968
Okay. Okay.

23:55.059 --> 23:56.435
Let me give you something.
Look.

23:56.519 --> 24:00.683
I am loaded with currency,

24:00.773 --> 24:02.513
and I'm looking for something
a little special.

24:02.609 --> 24:06.318
And this is the only crap that
I've been able to find.

24:07.780 --> 24:09.691
And, uh...

24:09.782 --> 24:14.492
Kabaah told me that you were
the guy to see to get some
really serious dren.

24:14.579 --> 24:16.865
(Jool sobbing)

24:23.463 --> 24:26.671
Pilot:
If they drained that much
fluid from her, Crichton, she would be dead.

24:26.758 --> 24:29.124
Crichton:
Shut up and let me
tell my story.

24:29.218 --> 24:31.345
You really must relax.

24:31.429 --> 24:34.296
Struggle only makes it
more painful.

24:34.390 --> 24:36.130
Hmm?

24:38.227 --> 24:41.139
Mmm, that's you you're
ingesting.

24:41.230 --> 24:43.721
Kabaah sent you.
Why didn't you say so?

24:43.816 --> 24:47.024
Ijust did.

24:47.111 --> 24:51.445
Apex of the moon tonight,
Fe'Tor's chamber.
Know where it is?

24:51.532 --> 24:52.988
I'll find it.

24:54.869 --> 24:57.281
We're auctioning some
incredible dren.

24:57.372 --> 24:59.203
This'll get you in.

25:00.458 --> 25:02.699
(Jool sobbing)

25:03.419 --> 25:05.330
(shrieking)

25:08.257 --> 25:12.296
My frelling head is killing me
from that spray, you
little tralk!

25:12.387 --> 25:13.422
D'Argo, you can kill her later.

25:13.513 --> 25:15.720
Right now we gotta get the
girls out of Fe'Tor's.

25:15.807 --> 25:17.172
So what are we doing here?

25:17.266 --> 25:18.597
'Cause I'm going to
help you, see?

25:18.685 --> 25:20.721
I'm going to make you
a sorta disguise.

25:20.812 --> 25:22.894
Hey, Hammerhead! How you doin'?

25:22.980 --> 25:24.186
I'm back for some home video.

25:24.273 --> 25:25.854
Get out! Get out!

25:25.942 --> 25:27.182
I don't think so.

25:27.276 --> 25:29.688
I need to see into
Fe'Tor's compound.

25:29.779 --> 25:32.065
No. lwon't help you
against him.

25:32.156 --> 25:34.613
Yes, you will or I'm gonna
snap your head off.

25:34.701 --> 25:37.989
Now I'm gonna see the compound
layout. You're gonna show
it to me.

25:38.079 --> 25:41.412
I don't care if it's empty, but
you're gonna show it to me now.

25:44.544 --> 25:48.378
Er, this is the auction room.

25:48.464 --> 25:51.126
Not bad. All it needs
is a big screen TV.

25:51.217 --> 25:52.172
Ka D'Argo.

25:52.260 --> 25:53.215
( hisses )

25:53.302 --> 25:54.803
No, it... it's okay.

25:54.887 --> 25:57.378
That's, um... that's Harvey.

25:57.473 --> 26:01.182
It's not Scorpy. He's a pookah.
He's... he's not real.

26:01.269 --> 26:04.807
But thanks to our unique shared
consciousness in this situation,

26:04.897 --> 26:09.140
we finally get to
meet Ka D'Argo.

26:09.235 --> 26:11.191
Give me five.

26:11.529 --> 26:13.360
Go away.

26:13.448 --> 26:17.407
I've had some weird
conversations in my head before,
but this is a little...

26:17.493 --> 26:19.233
Yeah, I know.

26:19.328 --> 26:21.785
Hey look, Harvey just shows
up every now and then to
give me bad advice.

26:21.873 --> 26:26.617
And my suggestion to you both
is to forget this folly.

26:27.587 --> 26:30.203
But since I know you won't...

26:30.298 --> 26:35.588
circuit breakers, to the entire
subterranean level.

26:35.678 --> 26:40.217
Darkness may be of
assistance to you.

26:40.308 --> 26:42.139
You know what, I think
that's not a bad idea.

26:42.226 --> 26:43.602
And the milking room you seek?

26:43.686 --> 26:44.596
(tapping)

26:44.687 --> 26:46.928
Ah. Down the hallway.

26:47.023 --> 26:50.140
Kabaah, show us the
milking room.

26:52.695 --> 26:55.277
Raxil, what is that thing?

26:55.364 --> 26:58.606
That's where they drain the
bodies to make the Freslin.

26:58.701 --> 27:01.283
Pleasure planet, my mivonks.

27:01.370 --> 27:04.703
We better count the
steps in here.

27:05.875 --> 27:07.035
One...

27:07.126 --> 27:08.866
two, three, four...
-two, three, four...

27:08.961 --> 27:10.576
five, six, seven...
-five, six, seven...

27:10.671 --> 27:12.252
eight, nine, ten.
-eight.

27:12.340 --> 27:14.171
(sighs)

27:14.926 --> 27:15.881
Ten steps.

27:15.968 --> 27:17.833
Uh, eight steps.
-Ten.

27:17.929 --> 27:20.591
Eight. Small legs, human.

27:30.858 --> 27:32.268
Ow.

27:36.823 --> 27:38.609
Jool?

27:38.699 --> 27:40.235
Jool!

27:56.008 --> 27:57.384
Jool?

28:01.597 --> 28:02.632
Something wrong?

28:02.723 --> 28:03.553
No.

28:03.641 --> 28:06.007
No, no... I was...

28:06.102 --> 28:07.933
I was just trying to find Jool.

28:08.980 --> 28:11.096
We should really be going.

28:11.190 --> 28:13.351
You really are quite beautiful.

28:14.610 --> 28:16.225
Yeah.

28:16.654 --> 28:18.645
Where's Jool?

28:19.323 --> 28:21.029
Don't be scared.

28:21.117 --> 28:22.982
Everything's all right.

28:23.077 --> 28:25.113
No, lwill not go to
Fe'Tor's auction.

28:25.204 --> 28:27.160
He knows what I look like,
so I won't get in.
-|'|| get you in.

28:27.248 --> 28:29.705
And you're not spraying me
with that stuff.

28:29.792 --> 28:32.158
I'm not spending the rest of
my life on the dance floor
doing some... -This Freslin will be different.

28:32.253 --> 28:34.335
No! You are not...
-Shut up! Just shut up!

28:34.422 --> 28:37.255
I did not do everything,
plan everything, so you
could back out now!

28:37.341 --> 28:39.206
Did you say plan?
-No, no, I didn't mean plan.

28:39.302 --> 28:41.338
I make a plan, like, like,
plan something...

28:41.429 --> 28:43.886
Did you say that you
planned this?
-No, no, no, I didn't mean that, no, no.

28:43.973 --> 28:45.304
I got everything from the
Transport Pod.

28:45.391 --> 28:47.347
Two pulse pistols, a pair
of night-vision goggles,

28:47.435 --> 28:51.849
200,000 in tiles so we can
buy any Freslin we want.
Uh, what did I miss?

28:51.939 --> 28:53.349
Two guns? You brought
just two guns?

28:53.441 --> 28:56.524
This little rodent has
been lying to us.

28:56.611 --> 28:58.272
She said that she
planned all this.

28:58.362 --> 28:59.693
Two guns?!

28:59.780 --> 29:02.237
I mean, I thought you were the
great Crichton and D'Argo.

29:02.325 --> 29:05.783
I mean, you blew up a
shadow depository.

29:05.870 --> 29:08.657
I mean, I thought you'd bring
pulse rechargers,

29:08.748 --> 29:10.613
and a plasma bomb,

29:10.708 --> 29:12.619
and a really big gunship.

29:13.377 --> 29:15.288
But no, you bring nothing!

29:15.379 --> 29:19.247
You bring two little weapons
that wouldn't kill a nik-nik!

29:19.342 --> 29:21.173
You have heard of us?

29:21.260 --> 29:26.220
Yeah, I've heard stories,
but obviously they aren't
worth a bucket of dren!

29:30.394 --> 29:32.134
What the frell have you
done to her?

29:32.229 --> 29:34.140
Get her out of that thing,
you fekik!

29:34.231 --> 29:36.893
Chiana, she's not in any pain.
-Jool? Jool?

29:36.984 --> 29:39.441
Don't worry. Eh?

29:39.528 --> 29:40.392
Here.

29:40.488 --> 29:41.773
Enough with the dren!

29:41.864 --> 29:44.947
You really shouldn't
waste the taste.

29:45.034 --> 29:46.444
Now I'll let your friend rest,

29:46.535 --> 29:49.572
but I need to replace her
with a new animal.

29:49.664 --> 29:53.202
Now I knew Fe'Tor wouldn't
bother your females while
you were in the bar,

29:53.292 --> 29:56.409
so I paid the blooming green
girls to get you out of the way.

29:56.504 --> 29:58.040
(laughing)

29:58.130 --> 30:00.121
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait!

30:00.216 --> 30:03.754
You let Fe'Tor kidnap
Chiana and Jool?

30:03.844 --> 30:05.345
( snarls )

30:07.264 --> 30:08.344
No, I didn't help him.

30:08.432 --> 30:11.970
I just created a situation
where everyone could...

30:12.061 --> 30:14.143
Is there anything else
you're not telling us?

30:14.230 --> 30:16.346
Nothing. Nothing. I promise.

30:16.440 --> 30:21.980
This little tralk has been
lying to us all along.

30:22.071 --> 30:23.527
So what I suggest is...

30:23.614 --> 30:24.774
( spritzing )
( screaming )

30:26.409 --> 30:27.740
Not again!

30:27.827 --> 30:29.112
Please don't hit me.
Please don't...

30:29.203 --> 30:30.568
Ah!

30:32.581 --> 30:36.073
All right, you can
hit me just once.

30:36.168 --> 30:37.749
Just once!

30:37.837 --> 30:39.748
Hello?
-What!

30:39.839 --> 30:42.546
I've got a live connection.

30:42.633 --> 30:45.010
The Nebari...
-Chiana!

30:45.094 --> 30:47.255
They've begun milking her.

30:47.346 --> 30:50.463
I think you're going
to be too late.

30:52.059 --> 30:53.674
(inhaling)

31:06.157 --> 31:08.239
( inhales deeply)

31:10.161 --> 31:11.992
I was right.

31:13.122 --> 31:15.238
You're exceptional.

31:16.584 --> 31:18.745
Would you like a taste?

31:24.341 --> 31:25.922
Drain as much as you can.

31:26.010 --> 31:27.796
Without damaging her value,
of course.

31:27.887 --> 31:29.969
D'Argo, you should
check this out.

31:31.140 --> 31:32.346
D'Argo?

31:34.185 --> 31:36.176
Who the hell...
-Oh, you know...

31:36.270 --> 31:39.762
the Freslin I sprayed him
with radiateds his
pheromones outwards

31:39.857 --> 31:43.315
and creates an aura morph, so
we all see D'Argo like this.

31:43.402 --> 31:45.688
I made him very attractive,
don't you think?

31:45.780 --> 31:48.362
What are you talking about?

31:48.449 --> 31:49.814
D'Argo?

31:52.411 --> 31:54.402
No more. Enough.

31:54.497 --> 31:59.958
Even I am not so gullible as
to believe that D'Argo turned
into another creature.

32:00.044 --> 32:03.707
I do not appreciate the lies
you tell in order to
circumvent...

32:03.798 --> 32:05.789
Whoa, ho! Hold 0...

32:07.176 --> 32:08.131
How long we known each other?

32:08.219 --> 32:14.089
Approximately two and
a half long cycles.

32:14.183 --> 32:16.344
I ever lie to you? Hmm?

32:16.852 --> 32:17.887
Hmm?

32:19.271 --> 32:21.478
D'Argo looked totally
different.

32:21.565 --> 32:23.521
Look at myself in the
mirror, I...

32:23.609 --> 32:25.520
(gasping)

32:27.279 --> 32:31.488
Pilot:
And why does he not
look that way now?

32:32.284 --> 32:33.399
Metabolism.

32:33.494 --> 32:34.950
Look, man, let me...

32:35.037 --> 32:37.870
Can I please tell the story
the way I want to tell it?

32:40.251 --> 32:43.288
Mitols is almost ready
for the Nebari.

32:43.379 --> 32:45.165
What should I do about
the other one?

32:45.256 --> 32:46.837
Wring Curls.

32:47.675 --> 32:49.256
Drain till failure.

32:49.343 --> 32:51.208
She would only spoil
the program.

33:03.482 --> 33:08.192
I am your host, but names
are not important.
Only currency.

33:08.279 --> 33:12.818
( with Southern drawl ):
Well son, I'm your buyer, and
money ain't important to me.

33:12.908 --> 33:14.023
Only quality.

33:14.118 --> 33:15.574
( clicks )
Know what I mean?

33:16.620 --> 33:19.282
You've come to the right
auction, then.

33:19.373 --> 33:21.204
May I suggest the Nebari?

33:22.168 --> 33:24.159
The finest I've ever tasted.

33:24.253 --> 33:25.663
Right.

33:26.172 --> 33:27.662
Raxil.

33:27.756 --> 33:30.213
Alive still.

33:30.301 --> 33:34.510
I thought you'd given the
Freslin trade away, after your
disaster on Ellapuria.

33:34.597 --> 33:37.634
Well, yeah, I did, lemme tell
ya, but things change.

33:38.809 --> 33:39.889
Enjoy. Bid high.

33:39.977 --> 33:42.343
Excuse me. Do I know you?

33:45.191 --> 33:46.146
Uh...

33:46.233 --> 33:48.189
Woman:
Hi.

33:50.404 --> 33:52.235
Ooh...

33:52.323 --> 33:55.110
I... I doubt it.

33:55.201 --> 33:59.285
I've become a new man recently.

33:59.371 --> 34:00.747
I made him very attractive.

34:00.831 --> 34:02.571
Ooh...

34:04.043 --> 34:07.206
15,000 on my right.
Have I any further bids?

34:07.296 --> 34:08.331
16,000.

34:08.422 --> 34:11.289
16,000 on my left. There.
Any further bids?

34:11.383 --> 34:15.217
Going once, twice, three times.
Are you all done?

34:15.304 --> 34:18.717
16,000.
Sold for 16,000 brandaars.

34:19.475 --> 34:21.716
You traded Freslin?

34:21.810 --> 34:24.017
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Years ago. Never killed
anybody, non-event.

34:24.104 --> 34:25.310
Non-event, my ass.

34:25.397 --> 34:28.981
No, no, no, my point is,
you must calm down.

34:29.068 --> 34:32.481
Increased oxygenation hastens
the metabolism of the Freslin.

34:32.571 --> 34:33.811
It's gonna wear off?

34:33.906 --> 34:36.192
Not for awhile, not if
he stays calm.

34:36.283 --> 34:37.193
(yelling)

34:37.284 --> 34:39.149
Calm. Anger bad.

34:39.245 --> 34:41.076
D'Argo, be cool, man.

34:41.163 --> 34:44.155
We buy the girls, Raxil's
mate if we can.

34:44.250 --> 34:45.831
No guns, no killing.

34:45.918 --> 34:46.668
( screaming )

34:46.752 --> 34:48.458
And we're outta here.

34:48.545 --> 34:50.957
I'll watch you from up here.

34:52.091 --> 34:54.252
Distinguished friends,

34:54.343 --> 34:57.426
we now come to the sale
you've been waiting for.

34:57.513 --> 35:01.631
I present the olfactory genius,
Heska Fe'Tor.

35:01.725 --> 35:04.637
( applause )

35:09.650 --> 35:13.734
Crichton:
Does this guy just scream
Vegas or what?

35:16.198 --> 35:17.483
Heska Fe'Tor.

35:17.574 --> 35:19.485
( applause )

35:25.332 --> 35:27.789
Friends, welcome.

35:27.876 --> 35:30.253
Thank you for coming at
such short notice.

35:30.337 --> 35:33.204
What a fine auction
this will be.

35:33.299 --> 35:35.085
May I present to you...

35:35.175 --> 35:37.336
Chiana.

35:39.388 --> 35:41.424
Metabolism, Luxan.

35:41.515 --> 35:44.257
Bidding starts at 25,000.

35:44.727 --> 35:46.638
25,000.

35:46.729 --> 35:48.185
30,000!

35:48.272 --> 35:49.682
40,000!

35:49.773 --> 35:51.183
50,000!

35:51.275 --> 35:52.640
55,000!

35:52.735 --> 35:54.350
60,000!

35:54.445 --> 35:55.935
85,000!

35:56.030 --> 35:59.113
What a wonderful bid,
Heska Tenaco.

35:59.867 --> 36:01.528
Are there any others?

36:04.371 --> 36:05.781
No?

36:05.873 --> 36:08.706
Crichton:
125,000.

36:16.133 --> 36:17.794
130.

36:20.387 --> 36:24.255
If you don't mind, I'd like
to take a closer look
at the carcass.

36:24.350 --> 36:25.931
Be my guest.

36:33.734 --> 36:35.895
Hey, Pip, can you hear me?

36:37.237 --> 36:39.193
Go away.

36:39.281 --> 36:41.192
What took you so long?

36:42.451 --> 36:44.407
150,000.

36:47.581 --> 36:49.162
151.

36:53.879 --> 36:57.212
You mind cutting this
heifer down so I can
take a closer look?

37:05.724 --> 37:07.680
(inhaling)

37:07.768 --> 37:09.383
Where's Jool?

37:10.771 --> 37:12.011
Milking Room.

37:12.106 --> 37:13.437
(growling)

37:13.524 --> 37:15.105
W-w-w-wait, is she yours?

37:15.192 --> 37:16.432
Used to be.

37:16.527 --> 37:18.188
Look, you've got Freslin
boiling your brain.

37:18.278 --> 37:19.654
Everything you feel's
way out of whack.

37:19.738 --> 37:21.194
What's going on down there on
down there, that's an act.

37:21.281 --> 37:23.237
He's just pretending
to be a buyer.

37:23.325 --> 37:25.532
175.

37:27.287 --> 37:28.493
250.

37:28.580 --> 37:30.662
One-quarter million brandars.

37:30.749 --> 37:32.831
( applause )

37:38.715 --> 37:43.254
Scorpius:
Circuit breakers, for the
entire subterranean level.

37:43.345 --> 37:45.677
I can double that bid if you
give me some more time.

37:45.764 --> 37:47.140
No more time.

37:47.224 --> 37:49.761
Currency on hand.

37:49.852 --> 37:52.844
Top the bid now or step aside.

38:04.825 --> 38:11.822
Sold to Heska Tenaco for
250,000 brandars.

38:13.292 --> 38:14.828
( hisses )

38:16.795 --> 38:18.535
Did you have to caress
her whole body?

38:18.630 --> 38:20.370
Oh, for cryin' out loud!
-It's just the Freslin.

38:20.466 --> 38:21.751
It makes him, ya know...
-Shut up!

38:21.842 --> 38:22.627
Shut up!

38:22.718 --> 38:24.834
Listen up, Mr. Horny Toad.

38:24.928 --> 38:27.135
Jool is still in the
Milking Room.

38:27.222 --> 38:29.508
I'm gonna hit the lights
and get Chiana.

38:29.600 --> 38:31.386
Good. Good, good, good.

38:33.103 --> 38:36.266
We'll get Jool and her mate.

38:37.608 --> 38:38.723
And then we'll wait.

38:38.817 --> 38:42.025
And remember, ten steps
down the hall.

38:42.696 --> 38:44.687
Eight steps, human.

38:44.781 --> 38:47.158
Don't do anything till
I hit the lights.

38:47.618 --> 38:49.108
No, no.

38:49.203 --> 38:50.693
Yeah, the lights.

38:51.622 --> 38:52.452
Good.

38:52.539 --> 38:55.121
(raucous laughter)

38:57.211 --> 38:59.202
This is all your fault!

39:00.881 --> 39:02.462
If you hadn't bribed those
women in the bar...

39:02.549 --> 39:04.289
Easy, Luxan, easy!

39:04.384 --> 39:06.420
( screaming )

39:07.387 --> 39:08.297
It's the Luxan!

39:08.388 --> 39:10.299
Security, move!

39:10.557 --> 39:11.672
Frell.

39:12.476 --> 39:13.716
Don't move!

39:16.188 --> 39:18.099
( screaming )

39:21.985 --> 39:23.270
(shots firing )

39:27.282 --> 39:28.943
Raise you fifty dollars.

39:38.835 --> 39:39.995
Chiana!

39:46.009 --> 39:47.510
Raxil:
No, no, that's not right.

39:47.594 --> 39:49.630
D'Argo:
No, it's eight.
-No, no, he said ten.

39:49.721 --> 39:52.303
Shut up, I know what I'm
talking about. It's eight,
you're making me lose my place.

39:52.391 --> 39:54.302
Eight, eight, shut up!
-You're wrong!

39:54.393 --> 39:55.849
(loud thud and grunt)

39:58.730 --> 40:00.937
Okay, ten.

40:06.154 --> 40:07.860
(Chiana trilling)

40:17.916 --> 40:19.156
Drop your weapon.

40:19.251 --> 40:20.366
( hisses )

40:23.839 --> 40:26.125
Jool, are you okay?

40:27.676 --> 40:29.007
Who is that?

40:29.094 --> 40:30.254
That's my mate.

40:30.345 --> 40:31.846
He's dead.

40:35.142 --> 40:36.598
D'Argo, save me!

40:36.685 --> 40:38.926
Crichton.
-D'Argo.

40:39.021 --> 40:40.181
Where's Raxil?

40:40.272 --> 40:41.853
In there. The mate is dead.

40:41.940 --> 40:43.771
Right, meet you in the Pod.

40:45.902 --> 40:47.312
Raxil!

40:48.322 --> 40:50.108
This is my honey.

40:50.198 --> 40:51.574
The brains to the machine!

40:51.658 --> 40:54.365
My design!
He stole it, sold it.

40:54.453 --> 40:56.114
Fe'Tor didn't even know
it was mine.

40:56.204 --> 40:57.364
(giggling)

40:57.456 --> 41:00.823
Worth a fortune!
( laughing )

41:01.627 --> 41:03.117
How's your neck?

41:03.211 --> 41:05.953
It's fine. I don't mind
sticking it out for you.

41:06.048 --> 41:07.879
You don't want these broken.

41:08.759 --> 41:10.545
You okay?

41:10.636 --> 41:11.921
Yeah.

41:12.012 --> 41:13.377
Good.

41:17.017 --> 41:18.223
Weird.

41:18.852 --> 41:20.183
(blow landing)

41:27.778 --> 41:30.019
You ruined everything.

41:43.085 --> 41:44.325
Skree-tak!

41:44.419 --> 41:46.000
(Chiana squeals)

41:46.088 --> 41:48.830
You smell exotic.

41:52.344 --> 41:55.302
( screaming )

41:55.389 --> 41:57.254
(Chiana yells, kick thuds)

42:00.185 --> 42:02.221
Smell this.

42:03.814 --> 42:05.725
(gagging )

42:12.030 --> 42:13.270
Neck still okay?

42:13.365 --> 42:15.230
Yeah.

42:15.325 --> 42:16.906
I knew it.

42:16.993 --> 42:19.951
Sad thing is, he's gonna
die happy.

42:33.760 --> 42:37.252
Crichton:
And that is what it
was all about.

42:37.347 --> 42:41.010
Raxil. She was getting her
chip back and she used us.

42:41.101 --> 42:45.390
She used us, man.
So it is not our fault.

42:46.231 --> 42:49.223
I don't believe you.

42:51.361 --> 42:52.350
Why not?

42:52.446 --> 42:54.858
Too many inconsistencies.

42:54.948 --> 42:57.189
Too much obfuscation.

42:57.284 --> 43:01.402
Obfuscation? How the hell
does that translate?

43:01.496 --> 43:04.988
Fine, you know what? Look,
you don't wanna believe me,
go ask the girls.

43:05.083 --> 43:09.167
Chiana and Jool are still
sleeping off whatever
it was they did,

43:09.254 --> 43:11.370
and I'm not inclined
to wake them.

43:11.465 --> 43:14.457
Pilot, I don't think you've
understood me.
Let me just start again.

43:14.551 --> 43:15.336
( screaming )

43:15.427 --> 43:17.918
I...
-Crichton, no!

43:18.013 --> 43:20.675
I have located another
planet nearby.

43:20.766 --> 43:22.256
Industrial.

43:22.350 --> 43:27.515
Comms traffic indicates they
have accommodations for
visitors.

43:27.606 --> 43:31.019
You and D'Argo are
to be visitors.

43:31.109 --> 43:36.103
Pack what you need.
We shall return for you
in eight solar days.

43:36.198 --> 43:37.438
Pilot.

43:38.784 --> 43:40.240
It was real.

43:40.327 --> 43:42.238
Perhaps, John.

43:47.250 --> 43:54.088
And this adventure, however
embellished, does not
alleviate that need.

43:54.174 --> 43:55.789
Um...

44:02.098 --> 44:04.180
Get out of here.

44:04.267 --> 44:07.054
Okay.

44:07.145 --> 44:10.979
You know, you really should
get out more. These things
do happen.

44:11.650 --> 44:12.765
(grumbling)

44:12.859 --> 44:14.269
What, he didn't believe you?

44:14.361 --> 44:16.147
No.

44:16.238 --> 44:20.026
Well, what was that thing
about a slim duck?
-Slam dunk.

44:20.116 --> 44:22.448
Whatever, it doesn't matter.
He's throwing us off Moya.

44:22.536 --> 44:24.276
Yeah, well, you want to
give it a go?

44:25.580 --> 44:27.195
(growling)

44:27.290 --> 44:28.405
No.

44:28.500 --> 44:30.206
See, I did my best.

44:30.293 --> 44:31.749
Your best was to blow it.

44:31.837 --> 44:34.249
I did my best.
-Well, you blew it.

44:34.339 --> 44:37.172
D'Argo, he's kicking us off
Moya because we argue.

44:37.259 --> 44:39.295
He's kicking us off Moya
because you argue.

44:39.386 --> 44:40.717
No, we argue.
-You argue.

44:40.804 --> 44:42.544
We. We argue.
-You argue.

44:42.639 --> 44:45.506
Oh, we... oh!
You would argue with a Iamppost.
-I do not. Open the door.

44:45.600 --> 44:47.340
You open it.
-You open the door.

44:47.435 --> 44:49.471
What, you're a girl? I'm going
to open the door for you?
Open the door.

44:49.563 --> 44:51.303
D'Argo:
I'm older than you,
show some respect.

44:51.398 --> 44:53.229
Crichton:
You can open the door.
I'm not opening the door.

44:53.316 --> 44:55.773
D'Argo:
Well then I'll just...
You open it.
