in Tehran this time of year.

00:08.404 --> 00:09.803
Checkmate.

00:12.825 --> 00:14.025
You shot and killed

00:14.027 --> 00:15.943
a Russian Mob boss
in broad daylight.

00:15.946 --> 00:16.895
Where's my money?

00:16.897 --> 00:18.329
I think you've been made.

00:20.034 --> 00:22.535
You did not recover the bombs?

00:22.537 --> 00:24.087
No, they're gone.

00:24.089 --> 00:25.623
Now there's three nuclear
weapons out there.

00:25.625 --> 00:28.424
<i>Sidorov'll sell</i>
<i>those bombs to anybody.</i>

Gamma rays and X-rays were
picked up by satellite.

02:06.163 --> 02:07.541
So far, the radiation fallout

02:07.543 --> 02:09.235
has only covered
uninhabited areas

02:09.237 --> 02:10.926
of the Chihuahuan desert.

02:10.929 --> 02:12.439
There's been communication
at the highest levels

02:12.441 --> 02:15.481
between Russia, Great Britain,
China, India...

02:15.483 --> 02:17.010
And everyone
denies involvement.

02:17.012 --> 02:19.064
It's like the

What's the Vela Incident?

No country ever

02:27.861 --> 02:30.390
I invited
CIA Operative Hanna here.

02:30.392 --> 02:32.050
On this one,
she's one of us.

02:32.052 --> 02:34.335
So from the description
and the fallout readings,

02:34.337 --> 02:35.781
we believe...

02:35.783 --> 02:38.575
This is one of the three
bombs Sidorov acquired.

02:38.577 --> 02:40.164
Why would he detonate it?
Proof that the bomb

02:40.166 --> 02:40.821
was functional.

02:40.846 --> 02:42.457
It would exponentially
increase the value

02:42.458 --> 02:44.127
of those two
remaining weapons.

02:44.129 --> 02:46.436
A nuclear bomb is
as big as the fear it creates.

02:46.438 --> 02:48.276
Then they just made
their bombs bigger.

02:48.278 --> 02:51.503
CIA and NCIS have been
monitoring this man.

02:51.505 --> 02:53.092
Michael Zhrov.

02:53.094 --> 02:55.518
Zhrov runs Sidorov's
arms-dealing company.

02:55.520 --> 02:57.273
While Sidorov is
in the wind, Zhrov meets

02:57.275 --> 02:58.862
potential buyers
for the weapons.

02:58.864 --> 03:02.290
If they complete the sale, these
bombs could disappear for years.

03:02.292 --> 03:04.917
Then we need to find Sidorov
another buyer and fast.

03:04.919 --> 03:08.095
It has to be a corrupt
international broker.

03:08.097 --> 03:09.883
Someone that Sidorov
already trusts.

03:09.885 --> 03:11.271
Any suggestions
where we might find

03:11.273 --> 03:14.332
such an individual,
Mr. Callen?

03:16.240 --> 03:18.262
Agent Hanna and Agent Hanna?

03:18.264 --> 03:19.417
We find Sidorov.

03:19.418 --> 03:21.022
We re-embed ourselves
in his crew.

03:21.024 --> 03:22.426
He owes you a lot of money.

03:22.428 --> 03:24.434
Gives you motive
to reconnect with him.

03:24.436 --> 03:26.959
It's too risky-- we don't know
if Sidorov made Michelle.

03:26.961 --> 03:28.298
We don't have a choice.

03:28.300 --> 03:30.004
This is an unprecedented threat

03:30.006 --> 03:31.643
to our national security.

03:31.645 --> 03:33.315
An agent's life is
on the line.

03:33.317 --> 03:34.971
Getting somebody killed
for no reason...

03:34.973 --> 03:36.977
Agents' welfare is secondary
to the mission.

03:36.979 --> 03:38.365
Always has been
and always will be.

03:38.367 --> 03:40.489
I'm getting on a plane now.

03:40.492 --> 03:42.513
I'll see you in six hours.

03:42.515 --> 03:44.046
Mr. Deeks, you'll be
in overwatch.

03:44.048 --> 03:45.461
No.

03:45.463 --> 03:46.677
Not Deeks.

03:46.679 --> 03:48.792
I need Callen on this.

03:48.794 --> 03:51.008
Wow, that's an ego boost.

03:51.010 --> 03:52.707
Not possible.

03:52.709 --> 03:55.205
Mr. Callen and Ms. Blye
will be out of the country.

03:55.207 --> 03:56.706
Where are we going?

03:57.623 --> 03:59.254
Iran.

04:04.485 --> 04:06.167
You got sunscreen?

04:06.169 --> 04:07.948
Yup.

04:07.950 --> 04:10.081
Extra ammo?

04:10.083 --> 04:12.247
Always.

04:12.249 --> 04:14.662
You know I can ride
a camel, right?

04:14.664 --> 04:16.327
Deeks, I'm gonna be fine.

04:16.329 --> 04:17.810
This is what I do.

04:17.812 --> 04:19.658
Not without me.

04:19.660 --> 04:21.940
I'm just saying that I would
feel a lot more comfortable

04:21.942 --> 04:24.138
if I was there watching
your ass, that's it.

04:24.140 --> 04:26.071
Of course you would.

04:26.073 --> 04:27.803
I don't...
I mean watching your back.

04:27.805 --> 04:28.904
It's not what you said.

04:28.906 --> 04:30.269
You know what I mean.

04:30.271 --> 04:31.967
Do you know what you mean?
Yeah... wait, why?

04:31.969 --> 04:34.817
What-what do you think
that I mean?

04:34.819 --> 04:37.132
I really have no idea.

04:40.631 --> 04:42.875
Okay, so where does
that leave us exactly?

04:42.877 --> 04:44.584
I don't know--
where does that leave us?

04:44.586 --> 04:46.260
You can't keep doing that.

04:46.261 --> 04:48.490
You can't keep just answering
my questions with questions.

04:48.492 --> 04:49.955
Why not?

04:49.957 --> 04:52.184
You have terrible
communication skills.

04:52.186 --> 04:54.104
<i>I</i> do?
Yes.

04:54.106 --> 04:56.270
You're the one who never
says what he means.

04:56.272 --> 04:57.768
That's not true.

04:57.770 --> 04:59.997
Then say something
you actually mean.

05:02.601 --> 05:05.529
Wheels up in 30-- let's go.

05:12.138 --> 05:14.692
I will see you in a few days.

05:18.681 --> 05:21.641
Yeah.

07:06.024 --> 07:07.569
What do you got?

07:07.571 --> 07:10.547
Radiation sensors at the border
pegged on a white cargo van

07:10.549 --> 07:12.239
that crossed into
Mexico just two days

07:12.241 --> 07:13.753
before the nuclear explosion.

07:13.755 --> 07:15.462
Mexican border patrol missed it.

07:15.464 --> 07:17.008
They let the van
into the country.

07:17.010 --> 07:19.091
That's how Sidorov got
the bomb into Mexico.

07:19.093 --> 07:20.213
Two days before that,

07:20.215 --> 07:21.516
Kaleidoscope found
the same van

07:21.518 --> 07:22.980
outside the Biltmore Hotel

07:22.982 --> 07:24.331
in downtown Los Angeles.

07:24.333 --> 07:25.558
According to the CIA,

07:25.560 --> 07:27.105
three members of Sidorov's gang

07:27.107 --> 07:29.492
entered the United States
two weeks ago.

07:29.494 --> 07:30.602
And they stayed
within blocks of...

07:30.604 --> 07:33.241
The Biltmore Hotel.

07:33.243 --> 07:34.838
The thing is the CIA
doesn't have surveillance

07:34.840 --> 07:36.940
of Sidorov entering
or leaving said hotel.

07:36.942 --> 07:38.588
They figured it was a dead end.

07:38.590 --> 07:40.017
But the analysts
don't know him like I do.

07:40.019 --> 07:41.446
He could be in there and no one

07:41.448 --> 07:42.454
see him come or go.

07:42.456 --> 07:44.387
Then let's find him quickly.

07:46.102 --> 07:49.178
<i>Fourth move,</i>
<i>Bobby Fisher style.</i>

07:49.180 --> 07:50.742
Wait for it-- boom.

07:50.744 --> 07:51.952
Check, partner.

07:51.954 --> 07:54.759
We're not playing
for real, Bob.

07:54.761 --> 07:56.154
And we're not partners.

07:56.156 --> 07:57.920
We are right now.
Not really.

07:57.922 --> 07:59.852
We're in the midst of
a nice little three-way.

07:59.854 --> 08:01.231
You and I... and that is

08:01.233 --> 08:02.829
a terrible choice of words.

08:02.831 --> 08:04.426
You talk to Kensi this
much during a stakeout?

08:04.428 --> 08:06.116
Usually more.

08:06.118 --> 08:08.122
Sometimes we text even though
we're right next

08:08.124 --> 08:09.564
to each other--
it's pretty adorable.

08:09.566 --> 08:10.526
Now, that's cute.

08:10.528 --> 08:12.084
I'm not texting with you.

08:12.086 --> 08:14.040
You know what, man?

08:14.042 --> 08:16.113
I've done this job
for a few years now.

08:16.115 --> 08:20.057
Some would say-- Hetty,
for example-- exemplary.

08:20.059 --> 08:21.499
Always had everybody's back.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.074
What's your point?

08:23.076 --> 08:24.732
I can take the crap
you dish out ten times over.

08:24.734 --> 08:26.274
I'm just curious about the why.

08:26.276 --> 08:29.174
I'm Navy, straight up.

08:29.176 --> 08:31.246
Everything you do is different.

08:31.248 --> 08:33.152
The way you dress, your jokes.

08:33.154 --> 08:34.264
Your hair.

08:34.265 --> 08:36.087
If this is about my haircut...

08:36.089 --> 08:38.126
it needs to end.

08:38.128 --> 08:39.368
It's not about your hair.

08:39.370 --> 08:40.894
It's about what it says
about you as a person.

08:40.895 --> 08:42.967
So you're saying it's
about my character?

08:44.841 --> 08:46.911
Yeah, something like that.

08:46.913 --> 08:48.520
North on Olive.

08:48.522 --> 08:50.343
Going towards the front
of the hotel.

08:50.345 --> 08:52.332
She's Sidorov's type.

08:52.334 --> 08:53.856
Not that I notice,
but there's a lot

08:53.858 --> 08:55.713
of beautiful black
women in Los Angeles.

08:55.715 --> 08:56.998
Oh, really?

08:57.000 --> 08:57.978
You are toast.

08:57.980 --> 09:01.308
None as beautiful
as you, of course.

09:01.310 --> 09:03.979
Nice recovery.

09:03.981 --> 09:06.719
Thing is, it's true.
Well, there are a lot

09:06.721 --> 09:08.358
of beautiful black women,
but very few wearing

09:08.360 --> 09:10.235
Valentin Kartashyov dresses.

09:10.237 --> 09:13.312
Valentin who?
Moscow's preeminent dress designer.

09:13.314 --> 09:15.306
Sidorov gives them
to all the girls.

09:15.308 --> 09:17.115
I-I got her.

09:17.117 --> 09:18.721
She's getting off
on the ninth floor.

09:21.596 --> 09:24.265
That's one of Sidorov's
men-- he's in there.

09:24.267 --> 09:27.004
There are no cameras
in the south staircase.

09:27.006 --> 09:29.337
And they lead directly
to the garage.

09:29.339 --> 09:32.836
He uses the stairs, goes in and
out in the middle of the night.

09:32.838 --> 09:35.203
Always has three
or four men with him.

09:35.204 --> 09:36.809
We're gonna have
to bring more.

09:36.811 --> 09:38.956
A lot more.

09:47.427 --> 09:48.778
Do you need
to have that thing

09:48.780 --> 09:51.178
pointed at me?

09:51.180 --> 09:53.798
We hit turbulence,
there might be an accident.

09:53.800 --> 09:56.587
Pilot did say it was gonna
get a little rough.

09:56.589 --> 09:58.616
Surely, Agent G. Callen,

09:58.618 --> 10:00.814
you didn't put together
a mission like this

10:00.816 --> 10:02.977
just to kill me.

10:02.979 --> 10:05.462
You need me for something.

10:05.464 --> 10:06.511
What?

10:06.513 --> 10:08.591
Oh...

10:08.593 --> 10:11.380
chess match begins again.

10:11.382 --> 10:13.155
Trouble is

10:13.157 --> 10:15.640
this time I don't want to play.

10:15.642 --> 10:19.494
You have nothing
to offer me.

10:19.496 --> 10:23.680
Remember our mutual friend,
Naseem Vaziri?

10:23.682 --> 10:26.113
He took it off.

10:26.115 --> 10:29.471
One joint at a time.

10:30.828 --> 10:33.441
You can't play chess
with a dead man.

10:33.443 --> 10:36.419
I need you...

10:36.421 --> 10:38.472
to broker a weapons
deal for me.

10:38.474 --> 10:41.946
I said... you have nothing

10:41.948 --> 10:45.254
to offer me, Agent G. Callen.

10:45.256 --> 10:47.173
But I do.

10:48.531 --> 10:50.433
I'm offering you...

10:50.435 --> 10:51.973
revenge.

10:51.975 --> 10:55.397
Against Vaziri and Iran.

10:55.399 --> 10:58.921
You have till
we land to decide.

11:08.055 --> 11:10.585
♪

11:23.110 --> 11:24.846
Hands on the wheel.

11:24.848 --> 11:26.947
Hands on the wheel!

11:33.202 --> 11:34.857
Sidorov.

11:34.859 --> 11:36.246
Get out of the car.

11:50.211 --> 11:52.228
Let's go, Isaak.

11:52.230 --> 11:53.750
Quite the operation.

11:53.752 --> 11:55.008
Where are we going?

11:55.010 --> 11:56.282
The bank.

11:56.284 --> 11:57.986
You owe us a lot of money.

12:00.468 --> 12:01.907
Meet the crew.

12:03.066 --> 12:04.885
This is a game for you?

12:04.887 --> 12:07.151
The quarters of
a million dollars ain't a game.

12:07.153 --> 12:09.153
Get in the car.

12:27.768 --> 12:29.213
Look who's here.

12:29.215 --> 12:31.724
Your boys are
following us, Isaak.

12:31.726 --> 12:32.788
You got 'em?

12:32.790 --> 12:35.115
Got 'em.

12:37.526 --> 12:39.803
Call your men,
tell them not to get out.

12:39.805 --> 12:41.899
You can leave with them
when we're done.

12:49.947 --> 12:53.155
You could have just asked me
for the money.

12:53.157 --> 12:55.782
I've never
left you wanting before.

13:02.018 --> 13:04.294
I'm guessing that's your ride.

13:04.296 --> 13:07.753
Next stop,
Federal Supermax prison,

13:07.755 --> 13:09.615
Florence, Colorado.

13:09.617 --> 13:11.610
Well, personally,
I'm lobbying for Gitmo.

13:11.612 --> 13:13.722
Opening move.

13:13.724 --> 13:14.936
You know what?

13:14.938 --> 13:17.380
Playing can be fun.

13:17.382 --> 13:18.727
Okay.

13:18.729 --> 13:21.089
Let's work together,
Agent Callen.

13:21.091 --> 13:24.530
Understand, I know
this is about revenge,

13:24.532 --> 13:26.358
which means you also harbor
that for me.

13:26.360 --> 13:29.069
Let me put your mind at ease.

13:29.071 --> 13:32.227
This is my first requirement.

13:32.229 --> 13:33.507
When it's all done,

13:33.509 --> 13:36.052
I need you to finish
what you started

13:36.054 --> 13:38.212
when you put that bullet
in my face.

13:39.095 --> 13:40.674
You want me to kill you.

13:40.676 --> 13:42.669
You owe me that.

13:42.671 --> 13:44.199
Well, as much as I'd like to...

13:44.201 --> 13:45.612
I don't do that.

13:45.614 --> 13:47.952
Maybe I can seduce you into it.

13:51.048 --> 13:53.169
You're going to call Vaziri

13:53.171 --> 13:54.389
and make him an offer.

13:54.391 --> 13:56.698
And what are we going
to sell him?

13:56.700 --> 13:58.686
Something that will change
Iran forever.

13:59.541 --> 14:00.911
Go on.

14:00.913 --> 14:03.135
A nuclear bomb.

14:03.137 --> 14:05.475
Hm...

14:05.477 --> 14:07.071
Our mission was designed
to look like you financed

14:07.096 --> 14:08.102
your own escape from prison.

14:08.103 --> 14:10.274
I'm sure the Iranian
Ministry of Intelligence

14:10.276 --> 14:11.662
would love
to hear from you.

14:11.664 --> 14:13.568
You tell them to have Vaziri
call you back.

14:18.552 --> 14:21.394
Maybe now we're
not playing chess.

14:21.396 --> 14:23.483
No.

14:23.486 --> 14:25.658
High-stakes poker.

14:27.280 --> 14:28.550
A wire transfer of this size,

14:28.552 --> 14:30.088
I'm going to have
to get approval.

14:35.508 --> 14:36.827
LAPD!

14:36.829 --> 14:38.415
Put your hands very,
very slowly on the dash

14:38.416 --> 14:40.287
and the back of the seat.

14:40.289 --> 14:42.995
And don't do anything stupid.

14:44.970 --> 14:47.812
The transfer has been completed
to the account in Dubai.

14:56.742 --> 14:58.178
Drop your weapon!

14:58.180 --> 14:59.432
I said, drop your weapon!

15:03.581 --> 15:04.832
Let me in!

15:04.835 --> 15:06.539
Let me in!
Unlock it!

15:06.541 --> 15:08.204
Leave him!
Let me in!

15:18.230 --> 15:19.765
Did Sidorov buy it?
Oh, yeah.

15:19.767 --> 15:22.126
So what do you want me
to do with these guys?

15:22.128 --> 15:23.839
Bury 'em in the system.

15:23.841 --> 15:25.343
No phone calls?

15:25.345 --> 15:26.993
No need.

15:26.995 --> 15:29.062
They're dead.

15:51.675 --> 15:53.097
Answer it.

15:55.686 --> 15:56.977
Hello.

15:56.979 --> 15:59.047
My old friend.

15:59.048 --> 16:01.586
That operation must have
cost you.

16:01.588 --> 16:03.800
You think I can't find you?

16:03.802 --> 16:06.969
I'm going to miss
our sessions together.

16:06.971 --> 16:08.215
Me, too.

16:08.217 --> 16:09.880
I enjoyed them.
Listen...

16:09.882 --> 16:12.224
we can reminisce for hours,

16:12.226 --> 16:15.086
but I have
a proposition for you.

16:15.088 --> 16:17.219
Found him. Century City.

16:17.221 --> 16:18.353
I'm listening.

16:18.355 --> 16:21.279
How much is it worth to Iran

16:21.281 --> 16:25.240
to become a Middle Eastern
nuclear power?

16:26.115 --> 16:27.828
You've got my attention.

16:27.830 --> 16:32.468
Two weapons,
Soviet, late '70s,

16:32.470 --> 16:35.427
17-kiloton capacity.

16:35.429 --> 16:38.579
There was a third
that was just detonated.

16:38.581 --> 16:41.409
Talk to your friends
in the Kremlin.

16:41.411 --> 16:44.724
They will confirm
the weapon's viability.

16:44.726 --> 16:46.826
Are you serious?

16:46.828 --> 16:50.950
As serious as torture,
my old friend.

16:50.952 --> 16:52.324
What's in it for you?

16:52.326 --> 16:55.639
The Iranian Ministry
of Intelligence

16:55.641 --> 16:57.771
will make me look
over my shoulder

16:57.773 --> 16:59.272
for the rest of my life.

16:59.274 --> 17:02.653
If not you,
it'll be someone else.

17:02.655 --> 17:04.853
You want your freedom
guaranteed.

17:04.855 --> 17:06.652
Yes.

17:06.654 --> 17:09.651
Not to mention
a nice little profit

17:09.653 --> 17:12.933
on the transaction, of course.

17:12.935 --> 17:16.981
And then, you and I can say
goodbye forever.

17:19.799 --> 17:21.681
Are you in?

17:23.597 --> 17:25.396
Set up a meeting
with the seller.

17:25.397 --> 17:27.462
I'll be in touch.

17:30.178 --> 17:31.977
I have another condition.

17:33.395 --> 17:35.426
I have a daughter,
16 years old--

17:35.428 --> 17:36.809
she lives in Paris--

17:36.811 --> 17:41.008
the result of a careless liaison
with a prostitute.

17:44.424 --> 17:46.673
You know we're going
to check this, right?

17:48.007 --> 17:49.471
Why would I lie about that?

17:51.306 --> 17:52.888
I would like my portion
of the money...

17:52.890 --> 17:54.554
You're not getting any money.

17:55.921 --> 17:58.752
...the money I would have gotten
from the deal,

17:58.754 --> 18:00.253
sent to her.

18:00.255 --> 18:03.251
It's a modest request,

18:03.253 --> 18:05.666
knowing your government

18:05.668 --> 18:08.299
is willing to do
practically anything

18:08.301 --> 18:11.882
to secure these nuclear devices.

18:16.747 --> 18:18.546
You know this man?

18:18.548 --> 18:19.800
Michael Zhrov.

18:19.802 --> 18:23.600
I've done business with him.

18:23.602 --> 18:27.115
He worked primarily
for Isaak Sidorov.

18:27.117 --> 18:29.323
He still does.

18:29.325 --> 18:31.047
You're going to call him
and tell him

18:31.049 --> 18:32.854
you have a potential
buyer for the bombs.

18:32.856 --> 18:34.946
See how much he wants for them.

18:36.854 --> 18:37.874
And my daughter?

18:37.876 --> 18:39.665
She gets nothing

18:39.667 --> 18:41.088
if we don't find the weapons.

18:41.090 --> 18:44.484
We make a good team.

18:55.280 --> 18:56.618
Yes.

18:56.620 --> 18:59.880
Michael, it's Marcel Janvier.

18:59.882 --> 19:01.053
How have you been?

19:01.054 --> 19:04.733
Mm... laying low.

19:04.735 --> 19:05.988
What can I do for you?

19:05.990 --> 19:08.030
I've heard you have
some, uh...

19:08.033 --> 19:10.339
unique merchandise.

19:12.431 --> 19:14.070
Did you find anybody?

19:14.072 --> 19:16.230
I called the girls. There's no
one else we can trust.

19:16.232 --> 19:18.321
I'd have to bring people
in from Moscow.

19:18.323 --> 19:19.911
That's going
to take too long.

19:19.913 --> 19:22.304
I want to move the merchandise,
get out of this country.

19:22.306 --> 19:24.145
I'll call you right back.

19:25.151 --> 19:27.994
I just spoke to a broker
with an Iranian buyer.

19:27.996 --> 19:30.034
Who?
Marcel Janvier.

19:30.036 --> 19:31.455
He's a sick bastard, but...

19:31.457 --> 19:32.960
It's why I trust him.

19:32.962 --> 19:36.187
Set up a meeting
with Janvier and the Iranians.

19:36.189 --> 19:38.561
I set the time and the place.

19:38.563 --> 19:39.949
Somewhere near
the desert house.

19:39.951 --> 19:42.104
Got it.

19:42.106 --> 19:43.375
All right, Isaak. Good luck!

19:43.377 --> 19:45.215
Wait.

19:47.339 --> 19:48.893
I have another job...

19:48.895 --> 19:50.129
for both of you.

19:50.131 --> 19:51.651
Short-term.

19:51.653 --> 19:53.440
Just protection. Easy.

19:53.442 --> 19:56.367
You gonna have to pay us first.

19:56.369 --> 19:57.871
Up front.

19:59.159 --> 20:00.931
We have trust issues.

20:11.247 --> 20:14.590
Come, meet my friends.

20:15.978 --> 20:18.436
Veronica, Maya...

20:18.438 --> 20:21.896
Quinn, David.

20:21.898 --> 20:23.952
Not so fast, Isaak.

20:23.954 --> 20:26.745
We need to get paid up front.

20:26.747 --> 20:28.936
Looks like we all have
trust issues.

20:28.938 --> 20:31.442
That's okay...

20:32.865 --> 20:35.372
...'cause so do I.

20:37.630 --> 20:39.050
So who are the Bond girls?

20:39.052 --> 20:40.633
Veronica,
the brunette,

20:40.634 --> 20:42.922
was a former Moscow
narcotics detective.

20:42.924 --> 20:45.971
She was discharged on suspicion
of killing a suspect.

20:45.973 --> 20:49.020
And Maya, the blonde,
is former Spetsnaz.

20:49.022 --> 20:51.986
I didn't know there were females
in the Russian Special Forces.

20:51.988 --> 20:55.149
They look like
very capable young women.

20:56.701 --> 20:58.281
Yes...

20:58.283 --> 20:59.732
We want to proceed.

20:59.734 --> 21:01.527
Good.

21:01.529 --> 21:02.698
I have a meet location.

21:02.700 --> 21:03.998
No.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.252
My location.

21:05.254 --> 21:06.850
No.

21:06.852 --> 21:09.766
The buyer wants
to choose the location.

21:09.768 --> 21:11.925
Security is the priority.

21:11.927 --> 21:13.771
This is non-negotiable.

21:16.079 --> 21:17.560
I'll make it work.

21:17.562 --> 21:19.045
Do you have a paper?

21:19.047 --> 21:20.329
Yes.

21:20.331 --> 21:24.119
34 degrees, 42 minutes,
45 seconds north;

21:24.121 --> 21:28.157
117 degrees, 44 minutes,
two seconds west.

21:28.159 --> 21:29.475
GPS coordinates.

21:29.477 --> 21:31.700
Five hours from now.

21:31.702 --> 21:33.184
Good-bye.

21:33.186 --> 21:34.484
Good-bye.

21:39.034 --> 21:40.596
Where is it, Eric?

21:42.060 --> 21:43.639
It's the Mojave Desert.

21:43.641 --> 21:45.399
It's literally
the middle of nowhere.

21:45.401 --> 21:47.651
Is there any geography
where we can be close?

21:47.653 --> 21:48.985
No.

21:48.987 --> 21:50.218
And from the look of it,

21:50.220 --> 21:51.699
Janvier is going to
have to drive in.

21:53.757 --> 21:56.913
Putting Sidorov
and Janvier together...

21:56.915 --> 21:58.279
makes me feel as if

21:58.281 --> 22:00.615
we're playing with fire,
Mr. Callen.

22:00.617 --> 22:03.444
That's 'cause we are.

22:18.547 --> 22:19.933
You know Agent Hanna.

22:19.934 --> 22:21.906
Your partner. Of course.

22:21.908 --> 22:24.570
He's gonna be undercover
at the meet as David Forman.

22:24.572 --> 22:26.429
Do not acknowledge him
in any way.

22:26.431 --> 22:31.200
We'll be watching you.
We will be listening.

22:31.202 --> 22:33.701
And we will be
inside your head.

22:34.820 --> 22:37.812
It's a scary place.

22:37.814 --> 22:39.047
Mm-hmm.

22:39.049 --> 22:41.020
You do anything
to jeopardize this mission

22:41.022 --> 22:42.961
or my people...

22:42.963 --> 22:44.524
and you'll get
your death wish.

22:44.526 --> 22:47.319
And no protective vest
this time?

22:47.321 --> 22:48.988
No.

22:48.990 --> 22:52.823
See? I told you
I would seduce you.

22:54.024 --> 22:55.441
Let's go.

22:55.443 --> 22:57.075
Wait.

22:58.394 --> 23:02.413
Just make sure
my daughter gets the money.

23:06.665 --> 23:09.750
This goes right, she will.

23:09.752 --> 23:12.334
Okay.

23:12.336 --> 23:14.953
I need the restroom.

23:20.240 --> 23:22.240
Hold it.

23:28.429 --> 23:30.846
Go ahead.

23:59.113 --> 24:00.813
Let's go.

24:05.567 --> 24:07.700
Hold up.

24:10.820 --> 24:13.320
Tracking device.

24:13.322 --> 24:14.654
It can't be removed.

24:14.656 --> 24:16.289
Get in.

24:16.291 --> 24:19.458
There's multiple cameras
in here and GPS tracking.

24:19.460 --> 24:21.208
You drive in, you meet
Sidorov and Vaziri.

24:21.210 --> 24:22.959
Don't go near 'em,
don't touch 'em.

24:22.961 --> 24:24.460
You do the deal, you drive out.

24:24.462 --> 24:26.412
We'll be close by
the whole time.

24:26.414 --> 24:27.778
Start it up.

24:29.298 --> 24:32.165
What do you think
the top speed of this car is?

24:35.836 --> 24:37.969
It doesn't matter.

24:39.722 --> 24:41.673
Let's go.

24:55.666 --> 24:57.785
Is Sam gonna be able to
stay away from Vaziri?

24:57.787 --> 24:58.871
He better.

24:58.873 --> 25:00.991
Vaziri knows him.

25:23.300 --> 25:26.588
I should stay back to cover.

25:26.590 --> 25:28.875
No.

25:28.877 --> 25:30.011
He stays back.

25:30.013 --> 25:31.898
You come with me.

26:05.212 --> 26:08.666
How is my "handy work"?

26:08.668 --> 26:12.640
Is it healing?

26:12.642 --> 26:14.960
Some wounds never heal,
my friend.

26:14.963 --> 26:18.685
Let's do this quickly.

26:18.686 --> 26:20.655
$20 million
for each weapon.

26:20.657 --> 26:22.926
Payment in gold

26:22.928 --> 26:27.116
at $1,590
U.S. dollars an ounce.

26:27.118 --> 26:28.985
That's a lot of money for

26:28.987 --> 26:30.989
a 40-year-old technology.

26:30.991 --> 26:32.542
Sell him on it.

26:32.544 --> 26:37.770
A nuclear weapon is
not about capability.

26:37.772 --> 26:39.506
It's about potential.

26:39.508 --> 26:43.396
It's about Iran
finally being able to sit

26:43.398 --> 26:48.072
at the big kids' table
with the United States.

26:48.074 --> 26:51.712
It's about giving
the Israelis night sweats.

26:51.714 --> 26:54.032
He's good.

26:54.034 --> 26:59.893
You chose this meeting place,
we choose the exchange location.

26:59.895 --> 27:03.048
Okay, but I want
a down payment first.

27:03.050 --> 27:05.103
I'm not exposing
the weapons

27:05.105 --> 27:07.056
until I see the quality
of the gold.

27:07.058 --> 27:10.863
$5 million in two suitcases.

27:10.865 --> 27:12.865
12.5% percent.

27:12.867 --> 27:14.150
It's reasonable.

27:14.152 --> 27:17.086
Okay.

27:17.088 --> 27:20.575
Anything goes south,
we keep the gold.

27:20.577 --> 27:22.961
Well, I guess
that's in his hands,

27:22.963 --> 27:26.349
or should I say "hand."

27:29.854 --> 27:31.088
Ouch.

27:31.090 --> 27:32.557
You see anything, Kens?

27:32.559 --> 27:34.727
All seems okay.

27:34.729 --> 27:37.229
As soon as the gold
is delivered,

27:37.231 --> 27:40.152
give us the exchange location.

27:40.154 --> 27:42.404
The deal
will be done.

27:42.406 --> 27:44.674
Good?

27:46.127 --> 27:47.962
Good.

27:51.968 --> 27:53.551
Good?

27:56.090 --> 27:58.007
Very good.

27:58.009 --> 28:00.177
Thank you.

28:06.636 --> 28:07.904
Something's not right.

28:07.905 --> 28:09.156
As soon as we have

28:09.158 --> 28:11.910
eyes on the bombs,
this all ends.

28:11.912 --> 28:14.246
There's a lot of chips
on the table.

28:14.248 --> 28:16.032
It's a lot to win.

28:16.034 --> 28:18.669
It's a lot to lose.

28:26.013 --> 28:29.499
So, Vaziri's guys just
dropped off the down payment.

28:39.480 --> 28:41.115
He's testing the gold.

28:42.152 --> 28:44.019
The gold is good. Go.

28:51.831 --> 28:53.999
<i>Da?</i>

28:54.001 --> 28:55.803
The gold is good.

28:57.977 --> 28:59.379
Okay.

29:04.660 --> 29:06.397
The exchange location.

29:06.399 --> 29:07.902
Check it out. Bring Quinn.

29:07.904 --> 29:09.423
Make sure it's safe.

29:13.853 --> 29:16.258
I need David
to deposit the gold.

29:16.260 --> 29:20.153
The cases weigh more
than 100 pounds.

29:20.155 --> 29:22.273
You want to carry them?

29:41.093 --> 29:44.299
Wait!
I want to speak to her.

29:50.451 --> 29:54.293
When this is over,
think about coming with me.

29:54.295 --> 29:57.919
$40 million can give
a very good life.

29:57.921 --> 29:59.807
I'll think about it.

30:00.678 --> 30:02.815
Quinn...

30:05.240 --> 30:07.912
...are you playing me?

30:17.924 --> 30:20.095
Does that feel like I'm playing?

30:22.319 --> 30:23.906
Wow.

30:23.908 --> 30:28.281
We should not mention that
to Sam, like, ever.

30:28.283 --> 30:29.801
It's not like
she had a choice.

30:29.803 --> 30:31.087
She's protecting
her cover.

30:31.089 --> 30:32.557
Oh, that's interesting.

30:32.559 --> 30:35.730
Kinda like me when I was
undercover with Monica.

30:35.732 --> 30:38.485
Undercover or under
<i>the</i> covers?

30:38.487 --> 30:39.992
And there it is again--

30:40.018 --> 30:41.493
little green-eyed monster
makes an appearance.

30:41.494 --> 30:43.531
What does, what,
what does that mean?

30:43.533 --> 30:44.783
Nothing.

30:44.785 --> 30:46.203
That means nothing.

30:46.205 --> 30:47.839
Like I said, poor
communication skills.

30:47.841 --> 30:51.363
I never ever, ever know
what the hell

30:51.365 --> 30:52.432
you're talking about

30:52.434 --> 30:54.103
because you never say
what you mean.

30:54.105 --> 30:55.505
It's so frustrating!

30:55.506 --> 30:56.941
It's like working
with a 14...

31:04.124 --> 31:06.194
How's that for communication?

31:15.282 --> 31:17.301
I gotta stay with Michelle.

31:36.861 --> 31:38.863
David, take the other case.

31:38.865 --> 31:42.103
Go to the bank
with Zhrov.

31:42.105 --> 31:44.710
Put the gold in the box
and come back

31:44.712 --> 31:46.613
and let's
finish this.

31:47.416 --> 31:49.253
Also, put the handcuff on.

31:49.255 --> 31:53.040
He will keep the key
till you get to the bank.

31:53.041 --> 31:54.811
Trust issues.

32:03.070 --> 32:06.125
Hey! There is a lot of money
in that case.

32:06.127 --> 32:08.271
Do not cross us.

32:13.848 --> 32:17.049
I've lost all electronic
communication with Sam.

32:19.781 --> 32:21.567
Hetty, I'm going in!
Sam's in trouble!

32:26.201 --> 32:27.908
That should bring them. Go.

32:38.832 --> 32:41.106
Backup, I presume.

32:41.108 --> 32:43.756
If there were anyone else,
I'm sure they'd be here.

32:43.758 --> 32:47.414
The keys to the handcuff
for your gun.

32:47.416 --> 32:50.616
Or I could tell him
to shoot you,

32:50.617 --> 32:56.419
then you'd both die.

32:56.421 --> 32:58.500
Give me the keys.

32:59.525 --> 33:00.531
Give me the keys!

33:05.653 --> 33:08.334
I've lost all electronic
contact with Deeks.

33:26.456 --> 33:28.259
The cars are gone--
they've left.

33:31.137 --> 33:32.923
No sign of Sam or Deeks.

33:32.925 --> 33:34.793
Sidorov needs them alive

33:34.795 --> 33:37.507
to find out if there are
any other agents.

33:37.509 --> 33:39.312
He still thinks
he can make a deal.

33:39.314 --> 33:40.726
Sidorov would just walk away.

33:40.728 --> 33:42.547
He's not gonna trust Janvier.

33:42.549 --> 33:45.603
Unless Janvier is the one
who tipped him off about Sam.

33:45.604 --> 33:47.748
I'm heading back
to the boatshed.

33:47.750 --> 33:50.399
Mr. Callen,
control your emotions.

33:50.401 --> 33:52.317
We need Janvier alive.

33:52.319 --> 33:55.243
It's the only way
to recover the bombs.

34:11.905 --> 34:14.781
It was very touching

34:14.783 --> 34:18.097
watching your partner
put his lips to yours

34:18.099 --> 34:21.696
to breathe life
back into you.

34:21.697 --> 34:24.349
He cares very much
for you.

34:24.350 --> 34:26.686
But I think soon
you're going to wish

34:26.688 --> 34:29.588
he had let you die
at the bottom of that pool.

34:29.590 --> 34:32.141
Where's Quinn?

34:32.143 --> 34:35.389
Ah, the beautiful Quinn.

34:35.391 --> 34:37.446
The reason we're here.

34:37.447 --> 34:40.647
So is she also
an undercover agent?

34:40.649 --> 34:41.755
What are you talking about?

34:41.757 --> 34:43.598
I need to know

34:43.600 --> 34:45.735
if it's safe to sell the bombs.

34:45.737 --> 34:48.605
Are there other
undercover agents involved?

34:48.607 --> 34:50.545
You think I'm a cop?
No.

34:50.547 --> 34:51.871
An agent.

34:51.873 --> 34:53.878
FBI, perhaps.

34:53.880 --> 34:55.851
You're out of your mind.

35:04.491 --> 35:05.965
Hey, Sidorov...

35:05.967 --> 35:08.054
you got this all wrong.

35:09.381 --> 35:11.618
A room within a room

35:11.620 --> 35:14.553
like this has
many functions.

35:14.555 --> 35:18.532
Soundproofing,
for example.

35:19.561 --> 35:22.231
Is Quinn also an agent?

35:22.233 --> 35:24.370
No.

35:48.926 --> 35:50.068
Let's go.

35:50.070 --> 35:52.556
Inside.
Why?

35:52.558 --> 35:55.037
It has to be a place
to exchange the trucks.

35:55.039 --> 35:56.093
The basement parking garage.

35:56.095 --> 35:57.266
Come on.

36:04.841 --> 36:06.633
I've got them, Kensi.

36:06.635 --> 36:08.476
They're headed
to the freight elevator.

36:09.499 --> 36:11.627
Give me a floor, Eric.

36:17.041 --> 36:19.134
Why are we going up?

36:19.136 --> 36:20.475
They're going up.

36:20.477 --> 36:22.100
I do not have a camera
in the elevator.

36:25.840 --> 36:27.432
They're supposed
to be going to a location

36:27.434 --> 36:28.972
where Vaziri and Sidorov
can exchange trucks.

36:28.974 --> 36:31.151
This...
Hetty, this doesn't feel right.

36:31.153 --> 36:32.291
I want to go in.

36:35.342 --> 36:38.140
Go in, Agent Blye.

36:38.142 --> 36:40.669
Bring me at least one
of the Russians alive.

36:40.671 --> 36:41.877
On it.

36:47.743 --> 36:49.870
Eric, I'm gonna need
another elevator.

36:49.872 --> 36:51.847
The public elevators are
in the front of the building,

36:51.849 --> 36:53.070
and you're gonna have
to go through security.

36:53.072 --> 36:54.999
Where are the stairs?

36:55.001 --> 36:56.741
Far end of the hall.

36:58.083 --> 37:00.396
Kensi, they stopped
at the 30th floor.

37:09.496 --> 37:11.389
No leaving

37:11.391 --> 37:13.467
until we get
the call from Isaak.

37:19.416 --> 37:20.588
Why is Isaak doing this?

37:20.590 --> 37:22.013
Don't know.

37:22.015 --> 37:23.437
But you know he loves you,

37:23.439 --> 37:25.785
so don't make us hurt you.

37:26.874 --> 37:29.052
I'm out of here.

38:54.387 --> 38:55.885
Michelle!

38:59.568 --> 39:01.482
Is Quinn an undercover agent?

39:02.482 --> 39:03.930
She's not an agent.

39:04.597 --> 39:06.810
But I know you are.

39:06.812 --> 39:09.043
As sure as I am standing here.

39:09.045 --> 39:10.592
Maybe...

39:10.594 --> 39:12.806
you got it wrong.

39:12.808 --> 39:13.971
No, David.

39:13.973 --> 39:17.036
An old and trusted
friend told me.

39:18.053 --> 39:19.750
Hold on.

39:21.034 --> 39:22.698
Get out.

39:22.700 --> 39:23.880
Leave the building.

39:34.191 --> 39:36.288
You gave Sam up!

39:42.118 --> 39:45.781
You can't hurt me anymore.

39:45.783 --> 39:48.478
Not after
what I've gone through.

39:48.480 --> 39:52.393
Which, by the way,
Agent Callen,

39:52.395 --> 39:55.690
I blame you for.

39:55.692 --> 39:59.554
You gave me to them.

39:59.556 --> 40:03.101
This is all your doing.

40:03.103 --> 40:06.265
Look into my eyes.

40:07.298 --> 40:10.511
I still only live
for one thing:

40:10.513 --> 40:14.509
To kill what you love.

40:19.039 --> 40:22.202
"David."

40:22.204 --> 40:24.534
"Agent."

40:35.443 --> 40:36.526
Good?

40:39.657 --> 40:42.470
Very good.

40:42.472 --> 40:43.736
Thank you.

40:48.483 --> 40:51.231
Sidorov is going to kill

40:51.233 --> 40:53.928
your beloved partner.

41:04.788 --> 41:06.585
Your body is
literally burning.

41:06.587 --> 41:09.466
Are you that strong-willed?

41:09.468 --> 41:12.548
What is it?

41:21.258 --> 41:23.271
She's not an...

41:23.273 --> 41:25.037
an agent.

41:26.038 --> 41:28.485
This isn't going to work.

41:28.487 --> 41:30.733
Let's start on the other one.

41:32.233 --> 41:34.031
Why was I wasting
my time with you

41:34.033 --> 41:36.695
when I have the weak one?

41:53.582 --> 41:55.880
That doesn't look very fun.

42:00.577 --> 42:03.408
Is it safe
to sell the bombs?

42:03.410 --> 42:06.539
Or are there other
undercover agents?

42:06.541 --> 42:10.203
I already told you,
I'm an LAPD narcotics officer.

42:10.205 --> 42:11.668
We were casing the house...

42:14.535 --> 42:17.780
I don't even know him, man.

42:25.409 --> 42:28.655
Is Quinn an undercover agent?

42:28.657 --> 42:30.819
Yes or no?

42:43.978 --> 42:45.676
Aw, come on, man.

42:45.678 --> 42:47.390
What are you doing?

42:47.392 --> 42:49.040
What are you doing...?

42:49.042 --> 42:50.089
No...!

42:56.635 --> 43:01.625
