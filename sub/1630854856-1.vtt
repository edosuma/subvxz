01:15.510 --> 01:16.780
Man on TV:
War continues in Europe.

01:16.980 --> 01:18.300
Hitler has suggested
that any questions

01:18.500 --> 01:20.610
over the future of Poland
will be settled entirely

01:20.810 --> 01:22.560
between Germany and Russia.

01:22.760 --> 01:24.040
He also stated that he regards

01:24.240 --> 01:26.350
the Czechoslovak Question
as closed.

01:26.550 --> 01:27.790
Speaking at Washington,

01:27.990 --> 01:29.920
President Roosevelt made
no comment as to...

[music continues]

02:35.670 --> 02:37.410
Clare: The name's Cavendish.

02:41.420 --> 02:43.160
A Miss Cavendish.

02:47.160 --> 02:49.860
Perhaps it's a first name,
Cavendish?

02:53.520 --> 02:56.140
Um, cigarette?

02:56.340 --> 02:58.140
The cigarettes you keep
for your clients,

02:58.340 --> 03:00.100
are they better or worse than
what you smoke?

03:00.300 --> 03:01.790
They're the same.

03:04.140 --> 03:06.530
Perhaps it is a first name,
Cavendish.

03:07.970 --> 03:10.500
It's... a good first name.

03:10.700 --> 03:11.970
Mm.

03:16.150 --> 03:18.380
Please.

03:18.580 --> 03:22.850
How private exactly are your
investigations, Mr. Marlowe?

03:24.290 --> 03:27.650
What can I do for you,
Mrs. Cavendish?

03:27.850 --> 03:29.860
Mm, you are a detective.

03:31.340 --> 03:33.430
I'd like you
to find someone for me.

03:33.630 --> 03:34.520
Mm-hmm.

03:34.720 --> 03:36.220
Nico Peterson.

03:36.420 --> 03:41.010
He was my lover, he disappeared
without saying goodbye.

03:41.210 --> 03:44.180
When you say disappeared,
do you mean out of your life

03:44.380 --> 03:46.360
or out of the world?

03:46.560 --> 03:49.150
I don't know,
that's why I'm here.

03:49.350 --> 03:51.580
Where was your husband,
Mrs. Cavendish,

03:51.780 --> 03:54.980
when your lover Nico Peterson
disappeared?

03:55.180 --> 03:57.100
[sighs]
In retrospect...

03:59.100 --> 04:01.850
do call me Cavendish
without the Missus.

04:02.050 --> 04:03.600
I like it.

04:03.790 --> 04:05.550
Was your lover the sort of man
to disappear

04:05.750 --> 04:07.430
with you as a lover?

04:07.620 --> 04:09.990
Normally,
they don't disappear easily.

04:10.190 --> 04:12.600
Marlowe: No, I bet they don't.

04:12.800 --> 04:14.210
They stay around,

04:14.410 --> 04:17.570
climb trellises,
scenes in restaurants,

04:17.770 --> 04:20.350
lie down in the road,
promise you anything.

04:20.550 --> 04:22.050
Oh, I know how it goes.

04:22.250 --> 04:24.610
Do you lie down
in the road, Mr. Marlowe?

04:27.220 --> 04:29.090
- Drink?
- Please.

04:32.920 --> 04:36.110
Well, he's tall, like you.

04:36.310 --> 04:37.620
Bit of a weaker man.

04:38.750 --> 04:41.620
He dresses nice, meticulously.

04:43.150 --> 04:45.250
What does that say about a man?

04:45.450 --> 04:47.860
Does Mr. Peterson get money
from his profession

04:48.060 --> 04:51.380
or does he just
profess his profession?

04:51.580 --> 04:53.650
You seem to assume
that I was involved

04:53.840 --> 04:56.520
with someone unsuitable.

04:56.720 --> 04:59.640
Yes, unless you were
unsuitable for him.

05:02.040 --> 05:04.130
Go to hell,
you pathetic little...

05:04.330 --> 05:06.700
<i>Marlowe: Would it be accurate</i>
<i>to say that Mr. Peterson</i>

05:06.900 --> 05:09.880
<i>would be a marginal person</i>
<i>in motion pictures?</i>

05:10.080 --> 05:11.750
- Apologies, sir.
- Yes. Alright.

05:11.950 --> 05:13.320
<i>Clare: It would be accurate,</i>

05:13.520 --> 05:15.280
<i>it would be</i>
<i>very accurate indeed.</i>

05:15.480 --> 05:16.750
Man 1: Go to hell,
you pathetic...

05:21.050 --> 05:22.760
<i>Clare: We would meet</i>
<i>at the Corbata Club.</i>

05:22.960 --> 05:24.420
<i>Do you know it?</i>

05:24.610 --> 05:27.550
Marlowe: How did Mr. Peterson
know the Corbata Club?

05:27.750 --> 05:29.120
Was he your guest

05:29.310 --> 05:32.640
or the kind of guy
who was anybody's guest?

05:32.840 --> 05:35.110
My husband and I
have an arrangement.

05:36.980 --> 05:40.650
May I ask,
is your husband homosexual?

05:40.850 --> 05:43.090
[chuckles]

05:43.290 --> 05:47.000
No. He isn't remotely
that interesting.

05:47.200 --> 05:49.920
He likes polo,
alcohol, waitresses

05:50.120 --> 05:51.310
and my money.

05:51.510 --> 05:53.880
Marlowe: Your money,
Mrs. Cavendish?

05:54.080 --> 05:55.530
I beg your pardon, Mr. Marlowe.

05:55.730 --> 05:57.480
I'm asking if the
money is yours.

05:58.830 --> 06:02.320
My father was in oil,
he's dead.

06:02.520 --> 06:05.930
You'd know my mother,
but we won't discuss her now.

06:06.130 --> 06:09.940
Did you conduct your affair
with Mr. Peterson at the club?

06:10.140 --> 06:12.410
We weren't meeting
in the horse sheds, Mr. Marlowe.

06:14.110 --> 06:15.890
Marlowe:
What did he not show up for?

06:17.590 --> 06:19.030
An assignation.

06:19.230 --> 06:21.550
[instrumental music]

06:26.080 --> 06:29.130
<i>Clare: I telephoned him</i>
<i>a few times, no answer,</i>

06:29.330 --> 06:31.610
<i>and then I went to his house</i>
<i>the following week.</i>

06:31.810 --> 06:32.740
[door rattling]

06:32.940 --> 06:34.440
<i>The milk hadn't been canceled</i>

06:34.640 --> 06:36.920
<i>and the newspapers</i>
<i>were piled up on his porch.</i>

06:37.120 --> 06:39.100
[knock on door]

06:39.300 --> 06:41.710
<i>Marlowe: Did he have</i>
<i>things to hide?</i>

06:41.910 --> 06:43.800
<i>Clare: Haven't we all?</i>

06:44.000 --> 06:47.540
Marlowe: What do you think
has become of Mr. Peterson?

06:47.740 --> 06:49.940
Clare: Told you,
I want a set of fresh eyes

06:50.130 --> 06:53.370
and yours come
highly recommended.

06:53.570 --> 06:56.060
Maybe you'll find out
what I can't.

07:06.290 --> 07:10.080
My name's really Clare,
like the county.

07:12.560 --> 07:13.790
You know the county?

07:13.980 --> 07:16.880
Yeah, in Ireland.
I know it well.

07:17.070 --> 07:21.750
My mother was in pictures,
you'd know her.

07:21.950 --> 07:24.790
It's rather embarrassing
with the upper class.

07:27.400 --> 07:30.400
You're very perceptive
and sensitive, Mr. Marlowe.

07:35.360 --> 07:37.110
I imagine it gives you trouble.

07:37.310 --> 07:39.500
[instrumental music]

07:58.600 --> 08:00.480
[doorknob rattling]

08:16.580 --> 08:19.290
He ain't home, bo.

08:19.480 --> 08:23.290
What? He owe you dough
or make time with your wife?

08:23.490 --> 08:24.680
That's the way it is, huh?

08:24.880 --> 08:28.470
Yeah, I'd say so,
and good for him.

08:28.670 --> 08:32.900
He's not a bad guy, if you don't
trust people anyway. I don't.

08:34.600 --> 08:37.610
I think he's from Cleveland.

08:37.810 --> 08:39.480
That's my place
across the street,

08:39.680 --> 08:41.610
he used to come over sometimes,

08:41.810 --> 08:43.530
pass the time of day.

08:43.730 --> 08:45.660
Give me a smoke.

08:45.860 --> 08:48.490
How, uh, how long
has he been gone?

08:48.690 --> 08:51.530
Oh, I guess I last seen him
seven weeks ago.

08:52.830 --> 08:54.970
You, uh, you see him leave?

08:55.170 --> 08:57.840
No, I just noticed he was gone.

08:59.230 --> 09:01.500
How did you know?

09:01.700 --> 09:04.370
Well, he wasn't there anymore.

09:04.570 --> 09:07.030
That means there weren't any
women banging on his front door,

09:07.230 --> 09:09.940
or throwing a shoe at the house.

09:10.140 --> 09:13.990
I mean, I did pretty good
in my day, but not like him.

09:14.190 --> 09:15.860
Are you a cop?

09:16.060 --> 09:17.430
Sort of.

09:17.630 --> 09:20.390
A private dick ain't no cop.

09:20.590 --> 09:24.130
Yeah, you're not the first one
to come around asking about him.

09:24.330 --> 09:26.960
A pair of wetbacks
showed up last week,

09:27.160 --> 09:30.360
and they was all gussied up,
but a beaner in a suit

09:30.560 --> 09:32.880
and fancy necktie,
it's still a beaner, right?

09:33.080 --> 09:35.490
No, sometimes
he's the King of Spain.

09:35.690 --> 09:38.150
King of Spain don't ride
around in no Lincoln,

09:38.350 --> 09:40.320
with a Mexican re-spray.

09:40.520 --> 09:43.330
Yeah, I used to work in the low
end of the motor trade myself,

09:43.530 --> 09:45.550
it was two beaners in a hot car

09:45.750 --> 09:48.330
that had been across
the border and back.

09:48.530 --> 09:50.240

<i>Joe: Oh, let's start</i>
<i>at the beginning.</i>

09:57.500 --> 09:59.560
This guy's been looked at, sure.

09:59.760 --> 10:02.340
Grifts, alienations
of affection,

10:02.540 --> 10:05.830
parking tickets,
drunk at a social gathering.

10:06.030 --> 10:09.570
And in the early days,
public solicitation.

10:09.770 --> 10:11.140
Now nobody knew
he ever had a house,

10:11.340 --> 10:13.530
he's down as domicile unknown.

10:13.730 --> 10:15.050
He does have a house,
I was there.

10:15.250 --> 10:16.580
Yeah, well,
there's having a house

10:16.780 --> 10:18.540
and being the person paying
for it, I suppose.

10:18.730 --> 10:20.010
Who was paying for it?

10:20.210 --> 10:21.930
Well, I think you'll find
he was paying cash

10:22.130 --> 10:24.620
from his no visible
means of support.

10:31.150 --> 10:34.190
Hope the lady friend looking
for him looks good in black.

10:35.720 --> 10:38.120
He was killed.
October 22nd, hit and run.

10:38.320 --> 10:39.760
Outside the Corbata Club.

10:41.160 --> 10:42.650
You owe me lunch.

10:42.850 --> 10:44.600
Liquid or regular?

Oh, none at all, sir.

11:45.260 --> 11:46.960
Uh-huh.

Oh, hey!

Actually, no,

Albert. We've got
a hedge hopper here.

12:28.960 --> 12:32.710
Maybe there's a reason
you're unpopular with policemen.

12:32.910 --> 12:35.760
Keep getting, I don't know...

12:35.960 --> 12:38.890
punched, locked up,

12:39.090 --> 12:40.980
and almost,
but not quite, charged

12:41.180 --> 12:44.510
with accessory,
obstruction, etcetera.

12:44.710 --> 12:47.600
- And at your age.
- It's my manner, Joe.

12:47.800 --> 12:50.380
Yup, starting to wish
you still had your pension?

12:50.580 --> 12:52.300
Sure you are.

12:52.500 --> 12:55.870
Look, Marlowe, listen...

12:56.070 --> 12:58.380
This guy got killed after
getting sauced in there.

13:00.120 --> 13:01.570
The remains smelled
like a brewery,

13:01.770 --> 13:03.610
and he had marks
up and down his arms,

13:03.810 --> 13:05.440
his head popped like a pumpkin.

13:05.640 --> 13:07.090
The Corbata Club
likes to make it nice,

13:07.290 --> 13:08.660
it does not like trouble.

13:08.860 --> 13:10.710
Hit and run
is two crimes at least.

13:10.910 --> 13:12.190
Don't fuck with me,
this is LA.

13:12.390 --> 13:13.620
These guys like Peterson

13:13.820 --> 13:15.190
are a dime a dozen,
they come out here,

13:15.390 --> 13:16.710
they fail a screen test
and they do what they've to do.

13:16.910 --> 13:18.450
Could any member
of the Corbata Club

13:18.650 --> 13:20.410
not know that he was dead?

13:20.610 --> 13:22.070
From our own Chief of Detectives

13:22.270 --> 13:24.240
to the new
Ambassador to England,

13:24.440 --> 13:26.770
I find it highly unlikely
it didn't come up over cream tea

13:26.970 --> 13:29.990
that a scumbag had caught
a Buick at the front entrance.

13:30.190 --> 13:32.380
Did they ask you
to broom the case?

13:32.580 --> 13:34.770
No one has to ask, my brother.

13:34.970 --> 13:36.420
Can I see the police file?

13:37.680 --> 13:39.160
We don't need it.

13:44.300 --> 13:45.820
Why you looking for this guy?

13:47.520 --> 13:49.660
A lady wanted to find him.

13:49.860 --> 13:51.480
Well, he'll wait
until she comes by.

14:07.970 --> 14:12.160
Dorothy: Go back to Boston, to
that miserable goddamn family.

14:12.360 --> 14:18.210
And then onto England, the court
of Saint fucking James.

14:18.410 --> 14:21.260
You're not the only one
who's done with this.

14:21.460 --> 14:22.520
Just remember one thing.

14:22.720 --> 14:25.000
Oh, please, darling,
not another.

14:25.200 --> 14:27.090
I paid for that horse.

14:27.290 --> 14:28.860
Dorothy: I get to keep him too.

14:32.740 --> 14:34.480
Could you, uh, do mine after?

14:38.830 --> 14:40.270
Are you the new mechanic?

14:40.470 --> 14:42.280
Maybe, what's it paying?

14:42.480 --> 14:44.760
- You've a name?
- Marlowe.

14:44.960 --> 14:46.930
This is hell nor am I out of it.

14:47.130 --> 14:48.670
That was his one good line.

14:48.870 --> 14:50.980
You don't think
he was Shakespeare.

14:51.180 --> 14:52.500
Neither did he.

14:52.700 --> 14:54.240
Joseph: Maybe I am out of it.

14:56.590 --> 14:58.070
Well out of it.

15:19.440 --> 15:21.660
You startled me, Marlowe.

15:21.860 --> 15:24.570
Apologies, seems to be my day
for startling.

15:28.920 --> 15:30.720
Who else did you startle?

15:30.920 --> 15:33.970
Some elegant Mick outside,
who quoted Marlowe.

15:35.490 --> 15:36.770
Are you quotable, Mr. Marlowe?

15:36.970 --> 15:38.330
Christopher Marlowe.

15:38.530 --> 15:42.380
Ah, he played in Doctor Faustus
at the Harvard Rep.

15:42.580 --> 15:43.990
Never lets anyone forget that.

15:44.190 --> 15:46.170
- He?
- Hm.

15:46.370 --> 15:49.910
Joseph O'Reilly,
my mother's financial adviser,

15:50.110 --> 15:52.960
oh, and soon to be
Ambassador to England,

15:53.160 --> 15:55.740
he never lets anyone forget
about that either.

15:55.940 --> 15:58.350
What did he play,
one of the seven deadly sins?

15:58.550 --> 16:00.080
[chuckles]
Please.

16:01.780 --> 16:04.270
Iced tea?

16:04.470 --> 16:05.750
You could have some of mine
if you like.

16:05.950 --> 16:07.840
Marlowe: No, thank you.

16:08.040 --> 16:09.970
I can offer you anything really,

16:10.170 --> 16:11.670
it's like the Arabian Nights
around here.

16:11.870 --> 16:13.050
Richard: Clare!

16:14.060 --> 16:15.320
Clare!

16:19.710 --> 16:21.150
Who the hell is this?

16:22.720 --> 16:25.420
Sorry, I'm, I'm Philip Marlowe.

16:25.620 --> 16:29.470
Hello, Marlowe.
Cavendish.

16:29.670 --> 16:33.340
Clare: Mr. Marlowe calls me
Cavendish, Richard. I like it.

16:33.540 --> 16:34.910
It's your name, darling.

16:35.110 --> 16:36.740
I like it as a first name.

16:36.940 --> 16:38.870
Richard: Glad I'm good
for something, dear.

16:39.070 --> 16:40.570
Have you, um, offered

16:40.770 --> 16:43.700
your very large friend
a proper drink, darling?

16:43.900 --> 16:47.230
She did, and I declined,
thank you.

16:47.430 --> 16:52.020
So, Mr. Marlowe, what kind of
business are you in?

16:52.210 --> 16:54.060
Mr. Marlowe detects things.

16:54.260 --> 16:57.110
Ah, and what are you
detecting here, Marlowe?

16:57.310 --> 17:00.810
My necklace.
I lost it, he found it.

17:01.010 --> 17:03.940
Richard: Of course he did.
I wonder where.

17:04.140 --> 17:06.590
Well, it was a matter of
retracing your wife's steps.

17:08.070 --> 17:10.420
- Marlowe.
- Yes, Mr. Cavendish.

17:10.620 --> 17:11.810
Fuck yourself.

17:13.330 --> 17:15.550
It's a pleasure to meet you too,
Mr. Cavendish.

17:17.340 --> 17:19.380
Clare: Didn't go for it,
that's odd.

17:21.120 --> 17:23.210
He must think there's
something between us...

17:24.650 --> 17:28.260
probably something... sexual.

17:30.310 --> 17:32.790
So tell me about you
and Mr. Peterson

17:32.990 --> 17:35.320
with no embellishments,
please.

17:35.520 --> 17:37.180
[instrumental music]

17:39.490 --> 17:42.800
<i>Clare: I met him at the Corbata</i>
<i>Club for the first time.</i>

17:43.000 --> 17:44.980
Thought he was handsome.

17:45.180 --> 17:50.290
We made love, and then I saw
him again, a few weeks later,

17:50.490 --> 17:53.160
not an assignation,
an accident.

17:53.360 --> 17:57.300
In Tijuana at my favorite bar,
La Quinteria.

17:57.500 --> 17:59.470
<i>I was there with my husband.</i>

17:59.670 --> 18:02.380
<i>We were watching the </i>
<i>procession, Dia de los Muertos.</i>

18:05.600 --> 18:08.040
[man whistling]

18:18.790 --> 18:20.710
<i>Marlowe: What was</i>
<i>he hustling in Mexico?</i>

18:20.910 --> 18:24.270
<i>Clare: I don't know.</i>
<i>Nico has many schemes.</i>

18:26.580 --> 18:28.240
<i>Marlowe: He's in the grave.</i>

18:28.440 --> 18:30.640
Nico Peterson is dead.

18:30.830 --> 18:32.110
He's pretending.

18:33.500 --> 18:35.210
He's pretending very well.

18:35.400 --> 18:37.950
Clare: Oh, I know,
he's dead and buried.

18:38.150 --> 18:42.160
That he got killed in front of
the Corbata Club, supposedly.

18:44.340 --> 18:47.090
Everybody says he was.

18:47.290 --> 18:50.310
But you see, the significant
thing is that

18:50.510 --> 18:53.700
I saw him the other day,
from the street,

18:53.900 --> 18:55.620
not in my mind's eye,

18:55.820 --> 18:58.320
on the street,
not dead at all.

18:58.510 --> 19:00.710
I think we're finished,
Mrs. Cavendish.

19:00.910 --> 19:01.920
No.

19:03.490 --> 19:05.400
I just wanted you to start
at the beginning.

19:06.920 --> 19:08.240
Begin at the beginning,

19:08.440 --> 19:10.680
that's what you're supposed
to do, right?

19:10.870 --> 19:13.500
- Where did you see him?
- Back in Tijuana.

19:13.700 --> 19:17.120
My mother wanted me to view
some Azteca horses,

19:17.320 --> 19:18.670
you know the prancing kind.

19:20.420 --> 19:24.520
I did that,
I do what she says.

19:24.710 --> 19:26.730
<i>So I was in La Quinteria again,</i>

19:26.930 --> 19:29.390
<i>having one of their</i>
<i>divine mojitos</i>

19:29.590 --> 19:31.700
<i>when I saw Nico</i>
<i>driving down the street.</i>

19:31.900 --> 19:33.950
[singing in foreign language]

19:42.520 --> 19:44.710
<i>Clare: He called himself</i>
<i>a collector.</i>

19:44.910 --> 19:48.660
<i>Most of all collected junk,</i>
<i>pretend antiques.</i>

19:52.620 --> 19:56.070
I suppose
they're for the movies...

19:56.270 --> 19:59.410
things that don't exist,
fairy tales.

20:00.760 --> 20:02.030
There's a man in Baja,

20:02.230 --> 20:04.380
who thinks Nico's
actually a producer.

20:04.580 --> 20:05.770
[laughs]

20:05.970 --> 20:07.290
He's been fleeced.

20:09.510 --> 20:11.690
What? What's wrong?

20:11.890 --> 20:13.870
You lied to me, Mrs. Cavendish.

20:14.070 --> 20:16.520
And I sat there and watched you
lie to your husband.

20:16.720 --> 20:18.080
Good afternoon.

20:30.570 --> 20:32.630
Hello, Mr...

20:32.830 --> 20:33.800
Marlowe.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.370
Oh, of course, I knew that.

20:35.570 --> 20:38.020
Richard made a call
when you first came in.

20:38.220 --> 20:40.330
You know what they say
about the old boys' club?

20:40.530 --> 20:41.980
What's that?

20:42.180 --> 20:43.990
There really is one.

20:44.190 --> 20:46.950
And what did he find,
Madame, uh...

20:47.140 --> 20:51.380
Dorothy Quincannon, and
don't pretend you don't know.

20:53.990 --> 20:57.740
Well, let's see,
you had a bad war,

20:57.940 --> 20:59.780
and then in the twenties,
you drank yourself

20:59.980 --> 21:01.480
out of a good job
in the oil business.

21:01.680 --> 21:02.530
Did I?

21:02.730 --> 21:04.790
Got on with the Los Angeles DA

21:04.990 --> 21:07.920
as an investigator, but that
didn't work out too well either,

21:08.120 --> 21:09.920
did it, Mr. Marlowe?

21:10.120 --> 21:12.660
You see, he found all that out
in five minutes.

21:14.220 --> 21:17.670
You're not the only one
who can make enquiries.

21:17.870 --> 21:20.630
You weren't looking for pearls.

21:20.830 --> 21:25.070
No, I throw them before swine,
it's a habit of mine.

21:25.270 --> 21:28.860
Tell me, Mr. Marlowe,
what does my daughter want?

21:29.060 --> 21:32.430
A divorce?
I might even approve.

21:32.630 --> 21:35.300
I'm sorry, I only discuss
business with my employer,

21:35.500 --> 21:38.300
so if you'll excuse me.

21:38.500 --> 21:40.290
<i>- Slan.</i>
<i>- Slan.</i>

22:11.850 --> 22:13.330
[sighs]

22:27.210 --> 22:29.650
[suspenseful music]

22:40.700 --> 22:42.360
Marlowe: Excuse me?

23:02.460 --> 23:04.470
- Hey, Fergus.
- Oh, hello.

23:04.670 --> 23:06.820
Ah, Jesus, here it is.

23:07.020 --> 23:09.350
Not a single lead
on who ran Peterson down.

23:09.550 --> 23:12.260
- We pursued inquiries.
- But how far?

23:12.460 --> 23:15.350
Marlowe, if one wanted
to find an absolute nest

23:15.550 --> 23:17.570
of entitled
and connected tosspots

23:17.770 --> 23:19.360
who feel they can
just drive away

23:19.560 --> 23:21.060
after running over
another drunk's head,

23:21.260 --> 23:23.490
you go to the Corbata Club.

23:23.690 --> 23:26.630
There were no witnesses,
a suspect wasn't possible.

23:26.830 --> 23:28.630
Saturday night, they come and go
at that club like rats

23:28.830 --> 23:30.590
through a hole in a garbage can.

23:30.790 --> 23:32.240
It could have been
any one of a hundred cars

23:32.440 --> 23:34.770
that flattened him, and probably
none of them contained

23:34.960 --> 23:37.070
anybody it'd be wise to arrest.

23:37.270 --> 23:40.770
We're in the real world here.
You understand a real world.

23:40.970 --> 23:42.510
Sometimes justice is blind,

23:42.710 --> 23:45.170
sometimes justice doesn't give
a shit and might be right.

23:45.370 --> 23:48.300
So who's the mystery broad
you're working for? His sister?

23:48.500 --> 23:49.870
Tell me about his sister.

23:50.070 --> 23:51.960
Maybe she identified him,
maybe she didn't.

23:52.160 --> 23:53.740
You tell me about his sister.

23:53.940 --> 23:57.400
I got my own sister, you can
stick his sister up your ass.

23:57.600 --> 23:59.050
I'm working for a person
who thinks

23:59.250 --> 24:02.400
that Nico Peterson
is still alive.

24:02.600 --> 24:06.490
Yeah, that's complicated.
I'm not a complicated man.

24:06.690 --> 24:08.840
My client claims
to have seen him,

24:09.040 --> 24:11.190
which gives you
a murder, my friend.

24:11.390 --> 24:13.100
Yeah, I got plenty, thanks.

24:15.190 --> 24:16.490
Here's your file.

24:19.020 --> 24:21.590
My employer thinks
he didn't die,

24:21.790 --> 24:23.120
that it wasn't him
that got smashed

24:23.320 --> 24:26.250
outside the Corbata Club,
to repeat myself.

24:26.450 --> 24:30.820
It gives me a murder, yeah,
theoretically, maybe.

24:31.020 --> 24:34.130
What's your trouble gents?
Money or women?

24:34.330 --> 24:36.350
Both, with the
complication of thirst.

24:36.550 --> 24:39.530
He's like the rest of us, Pat,
except he can't take a hint.

24:39.730 --> 24:41.270
- What'll you have?
- Whiskey.

24:41.470 --> 24:43.620
Usual.

24:43.820 --> 24:45.010
What's going on these days
Patrick,

24:45.210 --> 24:46.840
you, you married, or happy?

24:47.040 --> 24:48.580
At least my laundry's done.

24:48.780 --> 24:50.010
Pat had a rough
two weeks finding

24:50.210 --> 24:53.150
clean drawers after
he lost his mother.

24:53.350 --> 24:54.450
Fuck yourself.

24:54.650 --> 24:56.280
If I could, I wouldn't
have to listen.

24:56.480 --> 24:58.750
If it was an operation,
I'd sign up.

25:00.360 --> 25:02.890
If he's alive, Joe,
you have a homicide.

25:04.720 --> 25:06.600
Gonna keep saying that?

25:06.800 --> 25:08.470
That's the last thing
you want in homicide,

25:08.670 --> 25:10.080
I realize, homicide.

25:10.280 --> 25:12.690
What, you think
it was a homicide?

25:12.890 --> 25:15.300
I went to the graveyard.
Guess what?

25:15.500 --> 25:17.350
- He was cremated.
- Good guess.

25:17.550 --> 25:20.440
Yeah, even the teeth
were destroyed

25:20.640 --> 25:21.870
and they'd be everywhere.

25:22.070 --> 25:24.400
You ever run over a rat
or a cat, look at it?

25:24.600 --> 25:27.750
If Peterson didn't die, who did?

25:27.950 --> 25:31.930
Look, Marlowe, I know you got
this Sir Lancelot bullshit,

25:32.130 --> 25:33.490
and you live like some monk,

25:33.690 --> 25:36.670
you got no regular self-interest
anyone can count on,

25:36.870 --> 25:39.890
you like getting sapped and
locked up for just not stopping,

25:40.090 --> 25:44.160
and this is an interesting story
you have, if true.

25:44.350 --> 25:47.380
But that stiff, Peterson,
for all intents and purposes,

25:47.580 --> 25:49.640
had Peterson's wallet
in his pocket.

25:49.840 --> 25:51.420
Plus, he was identified
at the scene,

25:51.620 --> 25:53.160
for all intents and purposes.

25:53.360 --> 25:54.470
By who?

25:54.670 --> 25:56.080
The manager of the club,
Floyd Hanson,

25:56.280 --> 25:59.170
and by the Los Angeles
County Coroner, who's a member.

25:59.370 --> 26:02.080
So, it's nobody's business now
but county.

26:03.250 --> 26:04.650
County line runs where?

26:04.850 --> 26:06.390
Bay Canyon Drive.

26:11.430 --> 26:13.400
Right along here?

26:13.600 --> 26:15.220
Oh, Jesus.

26:18.440 --> 26:19.830
Make the call, Joe.

26:21.230 --> 26:22.920
I'll keep you out of it.

26:27.230 --> 26:29.150
[engine revving]

26:33.720 --> 26:37.560
Mr. Hanson says it's most
irregular, Mr. Marlowe,

26:37.760 --> 26:39.250
but he'll see you.

26:39.450 --> 26:42.040
Keep to the left, follow
the signs that say reception.

26:42.240 --> 26:43.520
Oh, thank you.

26:43.720 --> 26:46.030
[suspenseful music]

27:14.280 --> 27:15.930
Floyd: I'm Floyd Hanson
the manager.

27:17.500 --> 27:18.950
What can I do for you,
Mr. Marlowe?

27:19.150 --> 27:21.770
Don't bother turning off
the car.

27:21.970 --> 27:23.860
The gateman tells me
you're a private investigator,

27:24.060 --> 27:25.390
could that be so?

27:25.590 --> 27:28.090
Yes, I used to work
for the DA's office.

27:28.280 --> 27:31.040
- I've heard that.
- I've heard that you've heard.

27:31.240 --> 27:33.530
[engine turns off]

27:33.730 --> 27:36.040
I'm here about an
accident that occurred.

27:38.090 --> 27:40.620
- A serious one?
- Nico Peterson.

27:40.820 --> 27:42.060
Well, that actually
wasn't on the property,

27:42.260 --> 27:43.540
that was more
in the public road.

27:43.740 --> 27:46.020
Oh, I fully appreciate
the distinction,

27:46.220 --> 27:48.630
but sometimes people
get moved off the property

27:48.830 --> 27:51.980
even though their leg is lying
on it a little bit.

27:52.180 --> 27:54.420
There was an interesting case
in Cincinnati.

27:54.620 --> 27:56.200
What was that?

27:56.400 --> 27:59.600
A man was beaten to death,
and then he was put in the road,

27:59.790 --> 28:02.080
and his head was run over
by a tire,

28:02.280 --> 28:04.600
to obliterate the cause of death

28:04.800 --> 28:06.990
and to get him off the property.

28:07.190 --> 28:08.650
Mr. Peterson was run down
on the road,

28:08.850 --> 28:10.610
and the road is not
on the property.

28:10.810 --> 28:12.430
I appreciate that.

28:12.630 --> 28:14.650
Was Peterson a member
of this club?

28:14.850 --> 28:17.440
No, Mr. Peterson
wasn't a member. No.

28:17.640 --> 28:19.570

on the road like that.

any policeman be afraid of?

30:03.220 --> 30:05.070
Well, if the hit and run driver

30:05.270 --> 30:09.030
were a very substantial
or a connected person,

30:09.230 --> 30:11.380

of the Club in general.

it was probably a member,

even know he'd struck anything.

40:50.430 --> 40:54.460
So you see, Mr. Marlowe,
my daughter wasn't the only one

40:54.660 --> 40:57.420
spreading her legs for him.

40:57.620 --> 41:00.770
So, if you find Mr. Peterson,
come to me before--

41:00.970 --> 41:04.380
Where would I find
Miss Toxteth?

41:04.580 --> 41:08.470
Don't know, some god-awful
B picture I suppose.

41:08.670 --> 41:12.210
- Ma'am.
- Wait. How dare you?

41:12.410 --> 41:15.900
I'm a little confused,
I've already been paid.

41:35.960 --> 41:37.150

Ama-- Amanda, uh,
camera's over there,

41:40.700 --> 41:42.030
I need you to look
at the camera.

41:42.220 --> 41:44.720
Car rolls up,
you look at the cameras, okay?

41:44.920 --> 41:46.550
Thank you. Lunch.

41:46.750 --> 41:48.340
I can take this off, right?

41:48.540 --> 41:51.210
Man 3: Yes. After lunch.

41:51.410 --> 41:53.600
Believe me, I look better
without the war paint.

41:53.800 --> 41:56.520
Marlowe: Thanks for seeing me,
Miss Toxteth.

41:56.720 --> 41:59.350
Call me Mandy.
You're a detective?

41:59.550 --> 42:01.440
I'm more harmless than I look.

42:01.640 --> 42:04.260
That must be exciting,
being a detective.

42:04.460 --> 42:05.880
I can hardly contain myself.

42:06.070 --> 42:08.700
Oh, well, don't contain yourself
on my account.

42:08.900 --> 42:11.880
Nico Peterson
was your agent, yes?

42:12.080 --> 42:16.100
Well, he got me some work...

42:16.300 --> 42:18.710
"Riders of the Red Dawn,"
did you see it?

42:18.910 --> 42:24.070
- Mm, not yet, no.
- Well, it's gone now.

42:24.270 --> 42:28.070
Joel McCrea was supposed to be
in it, but something happened.

42:28.270 --> 42:30.600
I play the rancher's wife,
who makes eyes at an Indian,

42:30.800 --> 42:32.380
and the Indian gets hanged.

42:32.580 --> 42:34.110
I'll catch it
when it comes round again.

42:35.770 --> 42:39.210
Acting seems to be going well,
Miss Toxteth.

42:39.410 --> 42:40.950
You're sweet.

42:41.150 --> 42:44.700
Actually, my mother says
I should fuck more producers.

42:44.900 --> 42:46.130
What do you think?

42:46.330 --> 42:49.780
I think your mother
is gravely mistaken.

42:51.780 --> 42:54.880
What can you tell me
about Nico Peterson?

42:55.080 --> 42:57.010
How deeply should my account
be detailed?

42:57.210 --> 42:59.010
Marlowe: Well, when did you
last see him?

43:00.530 --> 43:03.150
I guess a week before he died.

43:03.350 --> 43:05.500
He was trying to get back
into my good graces.

43:05.700 --> 43:09.810
- He was a womanizer, yes?
- That's a tricky question.

43:10.010 --> 43:12.680
Nico liked the conquest,
not the women.

43:12.880 --> 43:15.510
He'd hardly touch you
after he'd had you.

43:15.710 --> 43:17.470
That's a particular kind of man.

43:17.670 --> 43:20.040
Some girls say
handsome men are cold,

43:20.240 --> 43:21.730
that's normally just what
you say to ugly men

43:21.930 --> 43:25.950
to make them feel better,
but... Nico was cold.

43:27.820 --> 43:29.830
Nico had girlfriends,
but he didn't have

43:30.030 --> 43:32.000
girls who were friends.

43:32.200 --> 43:34.700
Do you know any of his
other girlfriends?

43:34.900 --> 43:37.530
Amanda: Clare Quincannon
supposedly fell for him.

43:37.730 --> 43:40.580
The blonde with
the terrible mother.

43:40.780 --> 43:44.970
And the mother's story,
kept by the Ambassador.

43:45.170 --> 43:47.590
He even bought this
studio for her.

43:47.790 --> 43:50.850
I hear it's pure slavery.

43:51.050 --> 43:53.850
Did Nico have anything
to do with Mexico,

43:54.050 --> 43:56.250
business out of Mexico?

43:56.450 --> 43:59.080
There's only one
business out of Mexico,

44:01.360 --> 44:04.380
When he had money that was why,
and probably the only reason

44:04.580 --> 44:08.170
anybody would look for him,
owed money or a fix.

- Nico Peterson.

45:54.090 --> 45:56.850
- Philip Marlowe.
- You're much too persistent.

45:57.040 --> 45:59.410
- I'm trying to find Nico.
- He's dead.

45:59.610 --> 46:03.630
Wait a minute.
Are you so sure of that?

46:03.830 --> 46:06.510
I've been hired to look into
your brother's disappearance.

46:06.710 --> 46:09.210
He hasn't disappeared,
he's in a jar on a marble shelf.

46:09.400 --> 46:10.990
I had to buy it myself.

46:11.190 --> 46:13.380
You saw it, too,
should have known.

46:13.580 --> 46:16.170
What if I told you
he might be alive?

46:16.370 --> 46:19.080
I don't believe in
fairy tales, mister.

46:19.280 --> 46:23.310
I saw his body on
the gurney at the place.

46:23.510 --> 46:25.740
So it wasn't at
the club on the roadway.

46:25.940 --> 46:28.530
I did everything I had to.

46:28.730 --> 46:30.230
It couldn't have been
easy seeing him.

46:30.430 --> 46:33.580
Wasn't much fun. And what's
Floyd got against you?

46:33.780 --> 46:36.190
Why I wanted to meet,
and if you're afraid of him

46:36.390 --> 46:37.670

I'm not afraid of anything.

- Words.

Just words,
it's a book about words.

46:48.750 --> 46:52.470
- Nico was good with words.
- You say you saw his body?

46:52.670 --> 46:56.240
Yeah. And then the cop tried
to make me in the hallway.

51:23.590 --> 51:25.960
that you are
looking for someone.

- We're all looking for someone.

of some of those items.

related to the said items.

Why don't we take a ride
to the Corbata Club?

the items there.

1:25:07.050 --> 1:25:08.460
Well, well...

1:25:08.650 --> 1:25:10.580
if it isn't Mr. Nico Peterson.

1:25:13.320 --> 1:25:15.420
So...

1:25:15.620 --> 1:25:17.160
you're not dead.

1:25:17.360 --> 1:25:19.420
You're quite the detective.

1:25:19.620 --> 1:25:21.950
What do you want?

1:25:22.150 --> 1:25:26.470
You've been looking into the
circumstances of my demise.

1:25:26.670 --> 1:25:29.040
My determination for
some time has been that

1:25:29.240 --> 1:25:32.480
reports of your death
were greatly exaggerated.

1:25:32.680 --> 1:25:33.520
[Nico chuckles]

1:25:33.720 --> 1:25:34.870
I'll say.

1:25:35.070 --> 1:25:36.700
But not your sisters.

1:25:36.900 --> 1:25:42.360
My half-sister's, from my
fathers wild days in Acapulco.

1:25:42.560 --> 1:25:45.270
Marlowe: So you won't
be spilling any tears?

1:25:45.470 --> 1:25:47.890
She is dead, I know.

1:25:48.090 --> 1:25:49.880
Marlowe: She did not die
pleasantly.

1:25:51.450 --> 1:25:52.850
I couldn't help that.

1:25:53.050 --> 1:25:54.500
You could help yourself though.

1:25:54.700 --> 1:25:59.110
Well, I happen to have
something everybody wants.

1:25:59.310 --> 1:26:00.940
Marlowe: More dope?

1:26:01.140 --> 1:26:02.770
Much better than dope.

1:26:02.970 --> 1:26:04.240
[chuckles]

1:26:05.720 --> 1:26:07.240
You are all too much for me.

1:26:08.510 --> 1:26:10.420
All I am is a working stiff.

1:26:11.730 --> 1:26:13.870
I need to get to Clare.

1:26:14.070 --> 1:26:17.050
I will do everything in
my power to put you both

1:26:17.250 --> 1:26:19.480
together and never see
any of you again.

1:26:19.680 --> 1:26:21.620
Then give her a message
from me, will you?

1:26:21.810 --> 1:26:24.400
Tell her, I'll meet her in the
studio prop house, tonight

1:26:24.600 --> 1:26:26.270
and I'll have the goods
on the ambassador.

1:26:26.470 --> 1:26:27.620
What have you got on him?

1:26:27.820 --> 1:26:30.360
Just give her the
message, Marlowe.

1:26:30.560 --> 1:26:32.150
There's a few things
I want cleared up

1:26:32.350 --> 1:26:33.450
before we decide anything.

1:26:33.650 --> 1:26:34.760
What do you wanna know?

1:26:34.960 --> 1:26:36.800
The body outside
the Corbata Club.

1:26:37.000 --> 1:26:39.200
A musician who worked the club.

1:26:39.400 --> 1:26:41.160
- Did you kill him?
- No.

1:26:41.360 --> 1:26:43.060
- Did you kill him?
- No.

1:26:46.460 --> 1:26:48.080
Opportune?

1:26:48.280 --> 1:26:50.910
He looked like me,
I like people who look like me.

1:26:51.100 --> 1:26:53.210
What does Dorothy Quincannon
want from you?

1:26:53.410 --> 1:26:55.040
Well, maybe she wants to
fuck with the ambassador

1:26:55.240 --> 1:26:58.300
who's maybe trying to fuck
her daughter, I don't know.

1:26:58.500 --> 1:27:00.300
Put it together, Marlowe,
you're the detective.

1:27:02.390 --> 1:27:06.090
Everyone wants something on
somebody else, it's all just...

1:27:06.290 --> 1:27:07.870
blackmail in the end.

1:27:10.390 --> 1:27:12.270
I'll be in the prop house...

1:27:12.470 --> 1:27:14.760
7:30.

1:27:14.950 --> 1:27:16.570
Tell her I've got
what she wants.

1:27:20.270 --> 1:27:22.980
[instrumental music]

1:27:23.180 --> 1:27:27.420
<i>Clare: I've just realized, this </i>
<i>is my mother's favorite table.</i>

1:27:27.620 --> 1:27:30.120
This is where the ambassador
advises us financially.

1:27:30.320 --> 1:27:31.470
[indistinct chatter]

1:27:31.670 --> 1:27:32.730
You've asked her along?

1:27:32.930 --> 1:27:34.910
Yes, I felt I needed
some advice.

1:27:35.110 --> 1:27:38.300
- Clare: Financial?
- More like professional.

1:27:38.500 --> 1:27:39.610
Mm...

1:27:39.810 --> 1:27:41.560
My, my, my, it's Clare.

1:27:41.760 --> 1:27:43.090
[Dorothy chuckles]

1:27:43.290 --> 1:27:45.920
What a wonderful surprise,
Mr. Marlowe.

1:27:46.120 --> 1:27:47.220
Tea, mother?

1:27:47.420 --> 1:27:49.090
Dorothy: Scalded.

1:27:49.290 --> 1:27:51.230
Let's hope he brewed it right.

1:27:51.430 --> 1:27:54.710
- So a mouse can trot on it.
- So a mouse can trot on it.

1:27:54.910 --> 1:27:56.540
Marlowe: You know I've so
enjoyed our separate meetings

1:27:56.740 --> 1:27:59.410
that I felt the need for us
all to sit together.

1:27:59.610 --> 1:28:02.540
What Mr. Marlowe means,
my dear, is that he thinks

1:28:02.740 --> 1:28:05.110
he's too clever
for the both of us.

1:28:05.310 --> 1:28:07.720
One of you hired me,
the other tried to,

1:28:07.920 --> 1:28:10.250
so you both seem
to want the same thing.

1:28:10.450 --> 1:28:12.420
Nico left you
for a girl, alright.

1:28:12.620 --> 1:28:15.290
A plaster mermaid
full of Mexican powder.

1:28:15.490 --> 1:28:17.030
That's disgusting.

1:28:17.230 --> 1:28:21.000
A subject about which you
claim to know nothing, yes?

1:28:21.190 --> 1:28:23.560
Why don't you cut to the chase?

1:28:23.760 --> 1:28:27.000
And ask her why she hired you.

1:28:27.200 --> 1:28:29.260
To find Nico Peterson.

1:28:29.460 --> 1:28:34.790
Hiring a detective might just
be the best way to suggest...

1:28:34.990 --> 1:28:37.230
she doesn't know where he is.

1:28:37.430 --> 1:28:38.710
Clare: What do you think,
mother?

1:28:38.910 --> 1:28:41.670
I'm keeping him in
a shack in Rosarito?

1:28:41.870 --> 1:28:43.540
Maybe closer.

1:28:43.740 --> 1:28:46.530
Why don't you tell Mr. Marlowe
what you want with him?

1:28:47.970 --> 1:28:51.360
Perhaps I am trying my best...

1:28:52.630 --> 1:28:54.550
to save your reputation.

1:28:54.750 --> 1:28:56.160
[Clare scoffs]

1:28:56.360 --> 1:28:59.990
Well, maybe, it's the
other way around, mother.

1:29:00.190 --> 1:29:02.300
You see, Mr. Marlowe...

1:29:02.500 --> 1:29:04.950
her lover dumped her.

1:29:05.150 --> 1:29:09.650
The Ambassador to England
wants done with tinsel town.

1:29:09.850 --> 1:29:13.870
So she's playing the only role
left for her to play.

1:29:14.070 --> 1:29:15.790
The femme fatale.

1:29:15.990 --> 1:29:18.230
Her very own Medea.

1:29:18.430 --> 1:29:20.320
[chuckles]

1:29:20.520 --> 1:29:22.750
Oh, well!

1:29:22.950 --> 1:29:25.440
It's a role that awaits
us all, my dear.

1:29:27.530 --> 1:29:29.320
[shattering]

1:29:33.410 --> 1:29:34.680
Huh!

1:29:34.880 --> 1:29:36.380
Well...

1:29:36.570 --> 1:29:39.940
You suspected one of us
would do this, but...

1:29:40.140 --> 1:29:41.860
you just didn't know
which one, did you?

1:29:42.060 --> 1:29:45.080
- Would've laid a dollar on you.
- Mm.

1:29:45.280 --> 1:29:47.780
[sighs] You've quite
mastered the technique

1:29:47.980 --> 1:29:50.350
haven't you, Mr. Marlowe...

1:29:50.550 --> 1:29:52.220
of upsetting the women
in your life?

1:29:52.420 --> 1:29:54.040
There are no women in my life.

1:29:54.240 --> 1:29:55.610
[indistinct chatter]

1:29:55.810 --> 1:29:57.700
Well, then follow her.

1:29:57.900 --> 1:29:59.820
She likes older men.

1:30:01.260 --> 1:30:02.580
[exhales]

1:30:02.770 --> 1:30:04.360
Don't worry...

1:30:04.560 --> 1:30:06.790
I'll pay for the mess,
I always do.

1:30:12.050 --> 1:30:13.760
[indistinct chatter]

1:30:13.960 --> 1:30:16.330
Are you okay?

1:30:16.530 --> 1:30:19.770
I don't care that I'm
less than you think I am.

1:30:19.970 --> 1:30:22.070
I'm always less than
people think I am.

1:30:22.270 --> 1:30:23.420
[whistle blows in distance]

1:30:23.620 --> 1:30:25.380
You're one of those
people who's just

1:30:25.580 --> 1:30:27.680
lucky to be more
than we think you are.

1:30:29.510 --> 1:30:32.000
I'll send you the balance
of what I owe you.

1:30:32.200 --> 1:30:33.950
Maybe I can charge your mother?

1:30:34.150 --> 1:30:36.570
- Together with a finder's fee.
- A what?

1:30:36.770 --> 1:30:38.920
I found him, this afternoon.

1:30:39.120 --> 1:30:40.660
Or rather, he found me.

1:30:40.860 --> 1:30:43.090
I walked into my little house
and there he was.

1:30:43.290 --> 1:30:46.750
- Mr. Nico Peterson.
- Where's he now?

1:30:46.950 --> 1:30:50.360
He'll be waiting for you at the
prop house at Pacific Studios.

1:30:50.560 --> 1:30:53.320
- 7:30 p.m.
- Why the prop house?

1:30:53.520 --> 1:30:55.010
I was hoping you would tell me.

1:30:57.100 --> 1:30:58.200
Clare: Taxi!

1:30:58.400 --> 1:30:59.270
[brakes squeal]

1:31:01.190 --> 1:31:02.160
Go!

Cedric: A car is more
than a vehicle

1:31:13.760 --> 1:31:16.210
Mr. Hendricks used to tell me.

1:31:16.410 --> 1:31:18.480
It's a sealed confessional.

1:31:18.680 --> 1:31:20.960
A repository of secrets.

1:31:21.160 --> 1:31:23.700
And this city,
devoted as it is

1:31:23.900 --> 1:31:26.050
to the internal
combustion engine

1:31:26.250 --> 1:31:28.700
is a city of motorized secrets.

1:31:28.900 --> 1:31:31.750
You're waxing
philosophical, Cedric.

1:31:31.950 --> 1:31:33.230
You have to forgive me,
Mr. Marlowe.

1:31:33.430 --> 1:31:36.230
It's a habit I inherited
from my late employer.

1:31:36.430 --> 1:31:40.670
He had a tendency to digress,
but you did say the prop house?

1:31:40.870 --> 1:31:41.940
I did.

1:31:42.130 --> 1:31:43.240
[music continues]

1:31:43.440 --> 1:31:45.850
And I have to ask myself...

1:31:46.050 --> 1:31:47.590
why the prop house?

1:31:47.790 --> 1:31:50.900
And now you have to tell me,
Cedric, why the prop house?

1:31:51.100 --> 1:31:53.510

You see Mr. Hitchcock,
who could've worked wonders

1:32:15.170 --> 1:32:19.100
for Pacific Pictures,
but is sadly on his way to MGM.

1:32:19.300 --> 1:32:21.580
Mr. Hitchcock,
like Mr. Hendricks,

1:32:21.780 --> 1:32:24.400
always liked to keep
the script to himself.

1:32:26.140 --> 1:32:28.630
But many conversations,

1:32:28.830 --> 1:32:32.030
overheard from this here
front seat, enabled me to do

1:32:32.230 --> 1:32:35.410
what Mr. Hitchcock
always managed so adroitly...

1:32:36.680 --> 1:32:38.080
to work out the plot.

1:33:01.830 --> 1:33:03.320
You're on your own?

1:33:03.520 --> 1:33:06.410

auction house, Nico?

1:33:11.270 --> 1:33:13.720
That would be difficult,
two of them are dead.

1:33:13.920 --> 1:33:16.770
Well, you're gonna have
to start the bidding with me.

1:33:16.970 --> 1:33:20.290
What I've got here
is worth a fortune.

1:33:20.490 --> 1:33:22.340
Clare: Really?

1:33:22.540 --> 1:33:23.940
You better show me then.

1:33:27.030 --> 1:33:29.430
All of the records...

1:33:29.630 --> 1:33:32.250
of the heroin which was
flowing through his studio.

1:33:35.780 --> 1:33:38.230
It's more than enough to ruin
the ambassador's reputation,

1:33:38.420 --> 1:33:41.100
and the reputation
of Pacific Pictures.

1:33:41.300 --> 1:33:42.930
