WEBVTT

00:22.041 --> 00:24.500
Violet? You're an
absolute killjoy.

00:24.583 --> 00:26.375
I'm sorry. I don't
know anyone here.

00:26.458 --> 00:28.750
That's what a party's
for,
make a new friend.

00:28.834 --> 00:31.000
You never know, it
could
be a Hollywood star

00:31.083 --> 00:32.208
or a bank man.

00:32.291 --> 00:34.250
The Bartlebys have
a beautiful home.

00:34.333 --> 00:36.000
Of course they
have
a beautiful home

00:36.083 --> 00:38.750
they built the railroad
from here to Timbuktu.

00:38.834 --> 00:41.250
Do you think if you're this
rich you wake up in the
morning

00:41.333 --> 00:43.208
feeling very different
from how we feel?

00:43.291 --> 00:45.417
Sure. You wake up warm.

00:45.500 --> 00:47.166
[gasps]
There's Bartleby.

00:47.250 --> 00:49.834
'Oh! He makes Valentino
look like a slob.'

00:49.917 --> 00:51.959
I bet these Bartlebys
feel well-rested

00:52.041 --> 00:53.917
and clear every day.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.667
Because they don't have
to dream at night.

00:55.750 --> 00:56.834
Why would they?

00:56.917 --> 00:58.291
You're an odd duck, Violet.

00:58.375 --> 01:00.041
But I like you.

01:00.125 --> 01:01.625
I swear, 1929 is gonna be

01:01.709 --> 01:04.667
the most splendid year of my
life. I'm gonna see the
world.

01:04.750 --> 01:07.959
And I swear to meet a wealthy
man who's also handsome.

01:08.041 --> 01:09.458
(All)
Two!

01:09.542 --> 01:10.667
One!

01:10.750 --> 01:13.417
Happy New Year!

02:16.959 --> 02:19.709
- Hi.
- Hi.

02:19.792 --> 02:21.709
I got a cup for you, too.

02:21.792 --> 02:23.166
I don't think it's too cold
but you could

02:23.250 --> 02:24.834
stick a finger in and see.

02:24.917 --> 02:26.083
Had some at home.

02:26.166 --> 02:27.917
I'm so relieved to see you.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.750
I mean, I read about what
happened to you last year

02:29.834 --> 02:31.375
with that maniac.

02:31.458 --> 02:33.834
But you're doing well?

02:35.208 --> 02:38.125
I...I thought
maybe
you would call.

02:39.125 --> 02:41.583
I wanted to give you your space.

02:41.667 --> 02:44.709
You look fine.

02:44.792 --> 02:45.709
So do you.

02:45.792 --> 02:47.750
It's 'cause I'm happy.

02:47.834 --> 02:50.291
It's 'cause I'm getting married.

02:51.291 --> 02:53.083
That's why you wanted to see me?

02:53.166 --> 02:55.291
Lilly, when you know
someone's right for you

02:55.375 --> 02:57.417
you just feel it
undeniably in your bones.

02:57.500 --> 03:01.083
You ever had
that feeling?

03:01.166 --> 03:03.208
- What's his name?
- Jackie.

03:03.291 --> 03:06.250
So, will you let me buy you
a beautiful dress and shoes

03:06.333 --> 03:08.917
and will you be
my maid of honor?

03:09.000 --> 03:10.208
What about Chris?

03:10.291 --> 03:12.625
You're my firstborn.
Chris will understand.

03:12.709 --> 03:13.750
You can't find her, can you?

03:13.834 --> 03:15.083
Your sister's not
like you and me.

03:15.166 --> 03:16.667
She doesn't need a home base.

03:16.750 --> 03:18.208
She's running
from the law,
mom.

03:18.291 --> 03:19.750
Lilly, watch what you
say about your sister.

03:19.834 --> 03:20.959
Yeah, I'm really busy. So--

03:21.041 --> 03:22.250
Yeah, I know, your job's
important to you.

03:22.333 --> 03:23.750
Well, yeah,
we're overloaded.

03:23.834 --> 03:25.000
- Sorry.
- Right.

03:25.083 --> 03:26.834
Well, don't have to make
a decision now.

03:26.917 --> 03:28.750
Have dinner with me
and Jackie.

03:28.834 --> 03:30.083
I-I'll see.

03:30.166 --> 03:31.625
Okay.

03:38.166 --> 03:41.375
My great-grandmother
was murdered in 1929.

03:42.625 --> 03:45.792
1929. Alright.

03:45.875 --> 03:48.458
I know it was a long
time ago, but I felt like

03:48.542 --> 03:51.125
I had to come
in here for myself.

03:51.208 --> 03:53.333
I've been preparing,
doing the family history

03:53.417 --> 03:55.917
and I found
this online.

03:58.041 --> 03:59.166
A death certificate.

03:59.250 --> 04:01.291
All I've got.

04:01.375 --> 04:02.500
There's no relatives listed

04:02.583 --> 04:04.625
just the boarding house
where she lived.

04:04.709 --> 04:06.750
She gave up my grandmother
for adoption

04:06.834 --> 04:07.875
'so all we've ever known'

04:07.959 --> 04:10.750
is her name, Violet Polley.

04:10.834 --> 04:13.208
That's not a lot
for us to go on.

04:14.834 --> 04:16.375
- Detective Rush, Aimee Goodman.
- Hi.

04:18.125 --> 04:22.000
Aimee's great-grandmother
was murdered in '29.

04:22.083 --> 04:23.333
'29, huh?

04:23.417 --> 04:25.291
Do you ever feel like you
want to change your life

04:25.375 --> 04:27.458
but you can't outrun
your screwed-up family?

04:28.417 --> 04:29.583
Yeah.

04:31.041 --> 04:32.667
Well, the women in my family

04:32.750 --> 04:35.208
have not had the greatest lives.

04:35.291 --> 04:37.083
I think it goes
back to Violet.

04:37.166 --> 04:40.333
Like...a curse
hanging over us.

04:40.417 --> 04:42.291
(Valens)
'The thing is, uh..'

04:42.375 --> 04:44.500
...look, we're
swamped
right now, Aimee.

04:44.583 --> 04:47.083
Just not a lot
of spare time.

04:48.250 --> 04:50.000
We'll make the time.

04:52.917 --> 04:55.166
I'll give it
every second I
have.

05:28.709 --> 05:29.750
(Stillman)
'Violet Polley, found dead'

05:29.834 --> 05:32.917
on Christmas day, 1929.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.750
Cause of death,
fractured skull

05:34.834 --> 05:36.417
from a blow to the head.

05:36.500 --> 05:38.417
Photo doesn't show a lot of
blood at the crime scene.

05:38.500 --> 05:40.834
(Stillman)
'So she didn't ' die there.
Body was dumped.'

05:40.917 --> 05:42.250
Looks like she
didn't have family

05:42.333 --> 05:44.709
to spend the holidays
with, none listed.

05:44.792 --> 05:47.333
Home address is Darlington
boarding house in old city.

05:47.417 --> 05:48.542
I know that place.

05:48.625 --> 05:49.875
It's on the historical register.

05:49.959 --> 05:51.959
Susan B. Anthony lived
there for a time.

05:52.041 --> 05:54.083
Made us go there
in junior high.

05:54.166 --> 05:56.083
Can't remember a thing
except the gift shop.

05:56.166 --> 05:59.417
(Valens)
Guys in evidence whined at me
like a bunch of pre-teens.

05:59.500 --> 06:01.583
Guess they hate dust.

06:01.667 --> 06:04.166
All the belongings
Violet had with her

06:04.250 --> 06:06.375
when the body was found.

06:08.667 --> 06:10.417
What's that?

06:10.500 --> 06:11.750
- A rattle.
- For her baby.

06:11.834 --> 06:13.125
Aimee's grandmother.

06:13.208 --> 06:15.333
- We know who the father was?
- No one knows.

06:15.417 --> 06:17.834
Don't even know
specifically
when the baby was born.

06:17.917 --> 06:19.834
Just that she was brought
up at St. Mary's orphanage

06:19.917 --> 06:21.208
'in Germantown.'

06:21.291 --> 06:22.959
Start with the Darlington
boarding house.

06:23.041 --> 06:25.792
Maybe they can fill in the
gaps
on Violet staying there.

06:25.875 --> 06:28.458
Okay.

06:28.542 --> 06:30.583
How'd it go with
your mom this morning?

06:30.667 --> 06:32.917
She's getting married.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.667
Ah.

06:34.750 --> 06:36.667
For the fourth time.

06:40.041 --> 06:42.917
(Old woman)
'That quilt was made from
hand.'

06:43.000 --> 06:44.917
'Amazing, right?'

06:45.000 --> 06:47.959
That's a girl with time
on her hands.

06:48.041 --> 06:49.291
Better than snacking.

06:49.375 --> 06:50.625
(Woman)
Single girls

06:50.709 --> 06:54.291
lived in this place
from 1860 to 1934

06:54.375 --> 06:56.542
and left a lot behind.

06:56.625 --> 06:58.333
Quilt included.

06:58.417 --> 06:59.875
Plus, this.

07:01.750 --> 07:05.041
- Girl's journal.
- Covers the years '28 and
'29.

07:05.125 --> 07:07.250
Ever seen the name
Violet Polley in there?

07:07.333 --> 07:09.834
She's one of your
main characters.

07:09.917 --> 07:12.291
Uh, starting on this page.

07:15.875 --> 07:17.834
"Ginger Swensen
made it her business

07:17.917 --> 07:20.166
"to turn Violet
from a rag-a-muffin

07:20.250 --> 07:21.333
to a real Sheba."

07:21.417 --> 07:23.375
No kidding. What's the date?

07:23.458 --> 07:26.041
December 31, 1928.
New Year's eve.

07:27.291 --> 07:29.959
"First order of business,
the hair."

07:35.959 --> 07:38.125
I won't even
recognize myself.

07:38.208 --> 07:40.583
That's the idea,
out with the old

07:40.667 --> 07:43.125
in with the swanky.

07:43.208 --> 07:44.875
Where'd you say
you're from, Violet?

07:44.959 --> 07:47.166
Oley Valley, near reading.

07:47.250 --> 07:49.667
- Mm?
- I don't drink.

07:49.750 --> 07:51.333
I keep my mind sharp
because I'm a writer.

07:53.125 --> 07:55.709
Well, that's funny, 'cause
every writer I've ever met

07:55.792 --> 07:59.458
is fried to the hat or passed
out on Nick Bartleby's couch.

07:59.542 --> 08:01.625
Violet, you got a daddy?

08:01.709 --> 08:02.875
He's dead.

08:02.959 --> 08:04.917
And my mother, too.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.250
- I mean, fella.
- Oh.

08:07.333 --> 08:10.750
I did, but...
that's all over.

08:10.834 --> 08:12.375
The male persuasion are saps

08:12.458 --> 08:13.583
all of 'em.

08:13.667 --> 08:15.417
I moved to Philadelphia
because that's what

08:15.500 --> 08:17.417
the bus ticket I stole
said on it.

08:17.500 --> 08:18.875
What about you?

08:18.959 --> 08:22.375
I heard a song on the
radio
one day, back at home.

08:22.458 --> 08:25.291
It was the most
on-the-level
song I'd ever heard

08:25.375 --> 08:29.750
and when it was over,
I felt utterly different.

08:29.834 --> 08:31.000
What song?

08:31.083 --> 08:34.041
"Poor man's blues"
by Bessie Smith.

08:34.125 --> 08:35.625
'That's why I'm here'

08:35.709 --> 08:38.291
to sell my songs
to wonderful singers.

08:38.375 --> 08:40.750
But Bessie Smith's a negro.

08:40.834 --> 08:43.250
A writer needs to see the world.

08:43.333 --> 08:46.542
Well, it ain't the world,
it's Philadelphia.

08:46.625 --> 08:49.125
We'll see it tonight
at the Bartleby mansion.

08:49.208 --> 08:51.208
It's gonna be the berries.

08:56.041 --> 08:58.291
Bartleby mansion. Hmm.

08:58.375 --> 08:59.583
You seen that place?

08:59.667 --> 09:02.917
I could fit 25 of my
apartments in there.

09:03.041 --> 09:05.500
Those people were
American royalty.

09:05.583 --> 09:07.792
Their parties were known
all over the east coast.

09:07.875 --> 09:10.083
Pretty good invitation for
a boarding-house girl.

09:10.166 --> 09:12.458
The girls who stayed
here
would've been single

09:12.542 --> 09:14.291
and on the younger side.

09:14.375 --> 09:16.291
Ain't a party
without cute
girls.

09:17.750 --> 09:19.250
Any Bartlebys left in Philly?

09:19.333 --> 09:22.041
Nick Bartleby died in a
hunting
accident, I know that

09:22.125 --> 09:25.125
and the only one that's left
here is Muriel, and they say

09:25.208 --> 09:28.208
the old girl hasn't
left the house in years.

09:29.542 --> 09:31.208
Can we borrow this journal?

09:31.291 --> 09:33.917
Well, it's bad enough
I'm letting you touch it

09:34.000 --> 09:36.500
with your bare hands.

09:37.333 --> 09:38.333
Fine.

09:38.417 --> 09:42.583
But no direct sunlight,
and no moisture.

09:54.750 --> 09:58.417
(Vera)
I was plotting my escape, but
then I found something
helpful.

09:58.500 --> 10:00.500
Shh!

10:04.792 --> 10:06.542
'WPA transcripts.'

10:06.625 --> 10:08.667
Interviewee,
Ginger Swensen.

10:08.750 --> 10:10.000
Name from the
boarding house journal.

10:10.083 --> 10:11.917
Girl who cut Violet's hair.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.125
WPA, during the new deal

10:14.208 --> 10:16.625
paid people to do
interviews
with everyday Joes.

10:16.709 --> 10:20.000
This Ginger was one of them
talking about her roarin' 20s.

10:20.083 --> 10:22.709
"Before the big
crash,
we whooped it up."

10:22.792 --> 10:25.125
According to this,
biggest whoop of all

10:25.208 --> 10:26.792
was that New Year's eve party.

10:26.875 --> 10:29.125
"Where a friend of mine,
an inexperienced farm
girl

10:29.208 --> 10:33.750
from Oley valley, had a
bit
too much to drink."

10:35.125 --> 10:37.000
Mine, it's my house.

10:37.083 --> 10:40.083
Your brother says to bed
right now, Muriel.

10:44.333 --> 10:46.041
You were right about liquor.

10:46.125 --> 10:48.542
It is an artist's
best friend.

10:48.625 --> 10:52.875
I'm full of a certain
<i>joie de vivre.</i>

10:52.959 --> 10:55.208
I'd like to sing a song
for everyone.

10:55.291 --> 10:57.208
Bet it's the cat's pajamas.

10:57.291 --> 10:58.667
Hit it, Violet.

11:04.417 --> 11:05.583
Violet?

11:25.417 --> 11:27.583
Hello!

11:27.667 --> 11:29.709
This is a lovely party.

11:29.792 --> 11:33.500
This song is about poor
farmers where I'm from.

11:33.583 --> 11:34.917
Enjoy!

13:28.875 --> 13:30.917
Thank you.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.208
What's your name?

13:32.291 --> 13:33.959
I am Felix Spyczyk.

13:34.041 --> 13:36.208
(Violet)
'Happy New Year, Mr. Spyczyk.'

13:36.291 --> 13:37.417
Hey, what do you
mean to do here?

13:37.500 --> 13:40.500
Come with me,
someplace
private.

13:40.583 --> 13:41.959
What kind of girl
do you think I am?

13:42.041 --> 13:45.041
Kind of girl who drinks
too much champagne.

13:45.125 --> 13:47.625
Uh, get your filthy
hands off me,
mister!

13:49.125 --> 13:51.583
"We were only young girls
with the most vague idea

13:51.667 --> 13:54.000
of what catching a man's
eye could really mean."

13:54.083 --> 13:56.250
(Vera)
So this Spyczyk takes
advantage of the girls

13:56.333 --> 13:57.583
at his boss's party.

13:57.667 --> 13:59.750
Maybe what he did to
her had consequences.

13:59.834 --> 14:01.083
And those consequences

14:01.166 --> 14:03.875
wound up at St. Mary's
orphanage without a mother.

14:09.750 --> 14:11.792
Felix Spyczyk was
Bartleby's driver.

14:11.875 --> 14:14.333
That's what he told
the
arresting officer in
1922.

14:14.417 --> 14:17.458
When he's picked up for
illegal possession of liquor.

14:17.542 --> 14:19.291
Don't forget frequenting
a bawdy house in '28

14:19.375 --> 14:21.041
and possession of opium, '25.

14:21.125 --> 14:23.583
(Rush)
'Not the man you'd want around
the young girls at your
party.'

14:23.667 --> 14:25.291
Be great to ask
the Bartlebys about
it.

14:25.375 --> 14:27.834
Kat and Scotty went to the
mansion this morning. No
answer.

14:27.917 --> 14:29.417
Family lawyer hasn't
returned any calls.

14:29.500 --> 14:30.917
(Miller)
'Hey.'

14:31.000 --> 14:32.542
(Stillman)
Heard about your
Bartleby visit.

14:32.625 --> 14:34.625
Could've sworn I saw Muriel
through the curtains.

14:34.709 --> 14:36.458
She must leave
the house sometimes.

14:36.542 --> 14:39.166
Lie in wait while she
gets the morning paper?

14:39.250 --> 14:41.667
Uh, your mom called a few times.

14:41.750 --> 14:43.333
Wanted to make sure
you had the address

14:43.417 --> 14:44.750
for the restaurant.

14:44.834 --> 14:48.125
She wants me to be
her maid of honor.

14:48.208 --> 14:50.166
Buttering you up
with a free meal.

14:50.250 --> 14:53.417
I guess, if I go, at
least
she'll stop calling.

14:57.250 --> 14:59.709
(Jeffries)
'We're investigating
the murder of a girl seen'

14:59.792 --> 15:02.583
at the Bartleby
New Year's eve party, 1928

15:02.667 --> 15:05.625
being manhandled
by Felix Spyczyk.

15:05.709 --> 15:07.792
My grandfather did many
things during that
period

15:07.875 --> 15:09.417
that he was not proud of.

15:09.500 --> 15:11.125
'Includes everything
on his criminal record'

15:11.208 --> 15:14.291
and whatever young girls
he was seen manhandling.

15:14.375 --> 15:15.625
He told you about that?

15:15.709 --> 15:17.375
It was part of his job.

15:17.458 --> 15:19.834
- He was a procurer.
- For Bartleby.

15:19.917 --> 15:22.333
Whatever the great man wanted
that's what my grandfather

15:22.417 --> 15:23.542
had to get him.

15:23.625 --> 15:24.750
Booze and girls.

15:24.834 --> 15:27.333
Serves the guy for seven years

15:27.417 --> 15:31.000
then one day,
Nick Bartleby fires him.

15:31.083 --> 15:32.458
Plucks a clock off the mantle

15:32.542 --> 15:35.000
and says, "Take this
and hit the road."

15:35.083 --> 15:36.166
He made good, though.

15:36.250 --> 15:38.250
Sold the
clock for $75

15:38.333 --> 15:40.375
and started Spyczyk shipping.

15:40.458 --> 15:45.500
Took me years, but I tracked
it
down bought it at auction.

15:45.583 --> 15:48.250
(Valens)
'Your grandfather tell you a
lot
about his days with Bartleby?'

15:48.333 --> 15:52.125
At the end of his life,
he wanted to tell his
stories.

15:52.208 --> 15:55.875
So I listened
and made tapes of them.

15:55.959 --> 15:59.041
How about the night he
procured Violet Polley

15:59.125 --> 16:00.750
at the New Year's party?

16:00.834 --> 16:04.375
The one girl who said
no to Nick Bartleby.

16:07.750 --> 16:11.709
(Felix Spyczyk on tape)
'She said, "My name is
Violet Polley from Oley
valley'

16:11.792 --> 16:14.709
'and I am a songwriter,
not a boozy floozy."'

16:14.792 --> 16:16.500
That's her, our girl.

16:16.583 --> 16:18.917
(Felix Spyczyk)
'Mr. Bartleby had said to me'

16:19.000 --> 16:20.917
'"Get the singing dame."'

16:21.000 --> 16:22.500
'So I did.'

16:26.208 --> 16:27.375
Let me out!

16:28.959 --> 16:32.083
Okay, Spyczyk, old boy,
let her out!

16:32.166 --> 16:34.041
You told me
bring this one.

16:34.125 --> 16:35.709
'Not if she's violently
opposed to being'

16:35.792 --> 16:39.875
'in the same room with me,
which she clearly is.'

16:39.959 --> 16:41.917
That is, unless I'm growing
on
you and you'd like a drink.

16:42.041 --> 16:42.917
No, thank you.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.250
'Wait! Spyczyk,
bar the door'

16:44.333 --> 16:45.917
'until the lady
answers one question.'

16:46.000 --> 16:48.083
What on earth was that song?

16:48.166 --> 16:51.583
"One last dress" is
an original by Violet
Polley.

16:51.667 --> 16:53.792
Oh, I know her. She's known
to get a little soused

16:53.875 --> 16:56.250
at soirees and show
her knickers to strangers.

16:56.333 --> 16:59.125
I do not!

16:59.208 --> 17:00.667
Well, darn it.

17:03.583 --> 17:05.625
Do you ever miss being
part of the human race

17:05.709 --> 17:07.083
with the rest of us

17:07.166 --> 17:11.583
or do you like life
up on your mountain?

17:11.667 --> 17:13.291
I don't think I'm any better
than the average Joe

17:13.375 --> 17:14.792
if that's what you're implying.

17:14.875 --> 17:16.834
I just wonder if it gets old

17:16.917 --> 17:20.333
waking up each morning
with nothing to work for.

17:20.417 --> 17:25.041
If I had a talent like yours,
I would work, Violet Polley.

17:25.125 --> 17:26.125
Thank you, Mr. Bartleby.

17:26.208 --> 17:27.625
But as God made me

17:27.709 --> 17:30.208
I can only offer you charm
which does nothing for you.

17:30.291 --> 17:31.291
True.

17:31.375 --> 17:32.792
And my loyal driver Spyczyk

17:32.875 --> 17:34.583
'half as handsome but twice
the man that I am.'

17:34.667 --> 17:37.125
He and I can see you safely
home in my Packard.

17:37.208 --> 17:38.667
I don't think so.

17:38.750 --> 17:40.625
I'm a songwriter,
Mr. Bartleby

17:40.709 --> 17:43.125
not a boozy floozy.

17:52.709 --> 17:55.000
So Violet rejected
Nick Bartleby.

17:55.083 --> 17:56.291
That's a bold move.

17:56.375 --> 17:58.959
Here's the punch line,
Bartleby loved it.

17:59.041 --> 18:01.375
The one girl who says
no turns his head?

18:01.458 --> 18:04.166
Sent 300 flowers to her
boarding house the next day.

18:04.250 --> 18:08.041
Told my grandfather to lay
them
thick as oriental carpet.

18:08.125 --> 18:09.667
How many of those tapes you got?

18:09.750 --> 18:10.917
Days worth.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.709
How much would you like
to know about Poland?

18:14.792 --> 18:16.125
We'll get back to you.

18:18.083 --> 18:20.750
"300 flowers" is the name
of an old blues standard.

18:20.834 --> 18:22.208
Yeah?

18:22.291 --> 18:25.750
The lyrics go "Like an
oriental
carpet, thick and sweet."

18:25.834 --> 18:28.667
Violet was a
songwriter.
Where'd you hear that?

18:28.750 --> 18:31.667
Singer I know
covers it, Lena.

18:31.750 --> 18:33.125
Lena, huh?

18:34.875 --> 18:37.291
Let me get a look
at the threads.

18:37.375 --> 18:39.166
- Alright.
- What are you doing?

18:39.250 --> 18:40.834
Just making sure you look good
enough to see the woman

18:40.917 --> 18:42.875
you talk about in your sleep.

18:42.959 --> 18:44.542
We're going to see her.

18:44.625 --> 18:46.041
Not we.

18:50.500 --> 18:52.917
"300 flowers"
by V. Polley.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.709
So she got a song published.

18:54.792 --> 18:56.291
Few dollars in her pocket.

18:56.375 --> 19:00.208
Pretty upbeat song,
but it is about a love
triangle.

19:00.291 --> 19:02.166
Woman choosing between two men.

19:02.250 --> 19:03.750
Mm-hmm.

19:03.834 --> 19:08.000
"When I gave up what was
ours
I met a man so kind."

19:08.083 --> 19:09.875
Nick Bartleby could be
the kind one.

19:09.959 --> 19:12.041
Leaving a woman
300 flowers

19:12.125 --> 19:14.792
is kind.

19:14.875 --> 19:17.166
Why don't you bring
it to life?

19:52.291 --> 19:53.542
Came here to take you back.

19:55.625 --> 19:56.667
But it seems like
you've plumb forgotten

19:56.750 --> 19:59.041
what you and me made together.

20:01.959 --> 20:04.917
Hate to think of what you been
doing to earn these flowers.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.291
Been working on my songs.

20:06.375 --> 20:08.208
Get your head on straight,
Violet.

20:08.291 --> 20:09.917
You're acting
bigger than you are.

20:10.041 --> 20:12.583
I won't go home with you
to tend to pigs all my
life.

20:12.667 --> 20:14.208
That's who you are, woman.

20:14.291 --> 20:16.166
'I don't want
to tell you again.'

20:18.166 --> 20:20.500
You have three guesses to guess
which gorgeous man

20:20.583 --> 20:24.792
'is downstairs asking
for you personally.'

20:24.875 --> 20:27.291
Oh.

20:27.375 --> 20:28.959
I'm..

20:32.792 --> 20:34.000
Hey!

20:39.375 --> 20:40.750
You been actin' loose?

20:40.834 --> 20:44.542
Be careful, she kicks.
I've seen it.

20:44.625 --> 20:47.166
She's spoken for.
You scram,
cake-eater.

20:47.250 --> 20:49.917
She speaks for herself.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.625
You tell people back
in Oley valley

20:51.709 --> 20:53.083
they'll be hearing
about me.

20:53.166 --> 20:56.000
They will never
see me back there again.

20:57.583 --> 21:00.750
I'll take a ride
in that fancy car.

21:00.834 --> 21:03.041
I'd like to see
the world, please.

21:15.208 --> 21:18.834
Sounds like your Violet
chose Bartleby.

21:18.917 --> 21:21.667
Song says "I left behind
what was ours."

21:21.750 --> 21:23.542
Think that could
mean a baby?

21:23.625 --> 21:24.667
Could be.

21:24.750 --> 21:26.500
Songs from this
era
are coded

21:26.583 --> 21:29.166
when referring
to something
scandalous.

21:29.250 --> 21:31.542
Hometown guy thinks he's
gonna get a second chance

21:31.625 --> 21:33.250
with the mother
of his baby

21:33.333 --> 21:36.667
but he gets thrown over
for someone new.

21:36.750 --> 21:40.166
Many sad songs written
about being thrown
over.

21:40.250 --> 21:42.417
Many lives ended over it, too.

21:48.375 --> 21:50.041
We got the hometown
boyfriend's full name

21:50.125 --> 21:52.417
'from the boarding house
journal, Jeb Shiner.'

21:52.500 --> 21:54.709
Anything on him being
the father of Violet's kid?

21:54.792 --> 21:55.875
'Not yet, but'

21:55.959 --> 21:58.208
we know he didn't kill Violet.

21:58.291 --> 22:01.583
He was too busy with his pig.

22:01.667 --> 22:03.750
"Farmer's almanac."

22:03.834 --> 22:06.041
'"Jeb Shiner of Reading,
Pennsylvania'

22:06.125 --> 22:10.125
and his prize-winning swine,
December 22, 1929."

22:10.208 --> 22:11.792
Three days before
Violet was killed.

22:11.875 --> 22:14.041
And the pig contest
was in California.

22:14.125 --> 22:16.083
In 1929,it would've taken him
more than three days

22:16.166 --> 22:17.667
to get from there to here.

22:17.750 --> 22:20.667
So Jeb wasn't in Philadelphia
when Violet died.

22:20.750 --> 22:22.750
What'd you dig up on
the Bartleby relationship?

22:22.834 --> 22:24.834
(Valens)
That the man was a dog.

22:24.917 --> 22:26.417
Check it out.

22:26.500 --> 22:29.041
"Photoplay", US weekly,
back in the day.

22:29.125 --> 22:32.041
(Stillman)
And there's Nick Bartleby
looking smug with a gal named

22:32.125 --> 22:33.583
Carmela La Fleur.

22:33.667 --> 22:34.750
Who's that?

22:34.834 --> 22:36.041
She was Mae West-type actress.

22:36.125 --> 22:37.542
(Valens)
'Had a burlesque show.'

22:37.625 --> 22:39.250
It was pretty famous,
and she and Bartleby

22:39.333 --> 22:41.125
were an on-again,
off-again thing.

22:41.208 --> 22:42.709
Where's Violet fit in?

22:42.792 --> 22:45.000
According to gossip,
right in the middle.

22:47.166 --> 22:50.291
"Nick Bartleby had the nerve
to bring his new squeeze

22:50.375 --> 22:53.291
"to the black cat house
in Philadelphia.."

23:12.166 --> 23:14.375
I don't have the right
clothes for this place.

23:14.458 --> 23:16.500
To look like you
do in that dress

23:16.583 --> 23:18.959
these women would pay $200.

23:19.041 --> 23:21.542
(Violet)
'Well, they only need
two and a quarter.'

23:24.625 --> 23:26.917
Nick, this might just
be the greatest night

23:27.000 --> 23:28.625
of my entire life.

23:28.709 --> 23:30.625
Is it me or the dancers?

23:30.709 --> 23:32.458
Right now, I'm looking
over your right shoulder

23:32.542 --> 23:36.458
at Carmela La Fleur,
in the flesh.

23:36.542 --> 23:38.625
'Trust me, you're not
seeing her in the flesh.'

23:38.709 --> 23:41.667
She is absolutely
sensationally
beautiful

23:41.750 --> 23:45.208
and she'd be just the right
gal to sing my songs.

23:45.291 --> 23:46.583
Hello, Nick.

23:48.375 --> 23:50.166
Carmela.

23:50.250 --> 23:52.000
Oh, I see.

23:52.083 --> 23:54.667
So Philadelphia
really is a small town.

23:54.750 --> 23:55.959
Violet, let's go.

23:56.041 --> 23:57.625
'We can go anywhere you'd like.'

23:57.709 --> 24:00.750
I just don't want
our evening ruined.

24:02.208 --> 24:04.250
Hey, pal? What's
the meaning of this?

24:04.333 --> 24:06.500
The milk's for the girl
you're baby-sittin'.

24:06.583 --> 24:07.792
Help her grow up strong.

24:07.875 --> 24:09.333
Keep it to yourself,
would you, Carmela?

24:09.417 --> 24:13.000
From now on, I will, mister.

24:13.083 --> 24:14.333
(Carmela)
'Don't cry, darlin'.'

24:14.417 --> 24:16.083
This is nothing
compared
to what I'll do to you

24:16.166 --> 24:19.375
if I catch your flat behind
with Nick Bartleby ever
again.

24:24.291 --> 24:25.625
Okay.

24:25.709 --> 24:27.542
Carmela La Fleur
put
it out there.

24:27.625 --> 24:29.041
Don't be in public with my man.

24:29.125 --> 24:31.500
Could be Violet didn't
take the advice to heart.

24:31.583 --> 24:32.792
Got spotted again.

24:32.875 --> 24:34.834
Got a contact for Carmela.

24:34.917 --> 24:36.208
It's a local guy.

24:36.291 --> 24:37.291
(Stillman)
'Where'd you get that?'

24:37.375 --> 24:39.083
Name on a web site.

24:42.250 --> 24:43.709
"Mickey Stein.

24:43.792 --> 24:46.375
No. 1 fan."

24:46.458 --> 24:48.959
I know, fan sites are so cheesy.

24:49.041 --> 24:52.709
I put it up to
attract
info for my
thesis.

24:52.792 --> 24:54.625
What's your thesis
on, Mr. Stein?

24:54.709 --> 24:58.041
"Carmela La Fleur, the
quintessential vaudeville
girl's

24:58.125 --> 24:59.250
"re-invention of the feminine

24:59.333 --> 25:01.291
"in her work
in Philadelphia

25:01.375 --> 25:04.792
from 1927 to 1930."

25:06.291 --> 25:07.500
Specific.

25:07.583 --> 25:10.000
And yet there's so much to tell.

25:10.083 --> 25:11.583
What sparked your
interest in Carmela?

25:11.667 --> 25:13.583
My grandfather was her dresser.

25:13.667 --> 25:16.000
His job was to put
her clothes on...her?

25:16.083 --> 25:20.250
Wardrobe. Personal assistant,
hair, full-time confidante.

25:20.333 --> 25:22.750
He tell you about Carmela's
relationship with Nick
Bartleby?

25:22.834 --> 25:26.333
Like Elizabeth Taylor
and Richard Burton, those two.

25:26.417 --> 25:27.917
Back and forth.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.750
We're looking into
the murder of a girl

25:29.834 --> 25:31.000
that went out with Bartleby.

25:31.083 --> 25:32.625
Carmela wasn't happy about it.

25:32.709 --> 25:34.166
Murder?

25:34.250 --> 25:35.417
Really!

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
Do tell!

25:38.083 --> 25:40.834
We're gonna be the ones
taking notes here.

25:40.917 --> 25:41.959
Violet Polley.

25:42.041 --> 25:43.583
- Ever hear about her?
- Sure!

25:43.667 --> 25:45.041
Didn't know she was murdered.

25:45.125 --> 25:46.959
She really pissed Carmela off

25:47.041 --> 25:49.125
showing up at the burlesque
show with Bartleby.

25:49.208 --> 25:50.750
Well, that, that was then.

25:50.834 --> 25:54.792
A few months after that,
the girls made up.

25:54.875 --> 25:56.041
How do you know about it?

25:56.125 --> 25:57.291
My granddad was there.

25:57.375 --> 25:58.792
It was after one of Carmela's

25:58.875 --> 26:03.125
"Dragon lady" performances
at the Black Cat House.

26:03.208 --> 26:06.250
Such gorgeous silk.

26:06.333 --> 26:07.875
Straight from
the orient,
darling.

26:07.959 --> 26:09.417
'I've got a china man
mad for me.'

26:09.500 --> 26:11.959
He thinks I'd be
big
as tea over
there.

26:13.458 --> 26:15.750
(Violet)
'Hello, Carmela.'

26:15.834 --> 26:18.125
Can I have one moment
of your time?

26:18.208 --> 26:20.625
Autographed pictures in an
hour,
behind the stage door.

26:20.709 --> 26:23.333
- Shoo, fly.
- It's alright, Mickey.

26:23.417 --> 26:25.000
Don't you know who this is?

26:25.083 --> 26:26.834
It's Nick Bartleby's girl.

26:26.917 --> 26:28.458
Oh, dear.

26:28.542 --> 26:30.500
Carmela, please
don't turn me away.

26:30.583 --> 26:34.166
I'd like to ask you something.

26:34.250 --> 26:35.291
Well, what is it?

26:37.291 --> 26:40.125
I'm a songwriter,
writing original tunes.

26:40.208 --> 26:42.125
I write from the soul,
about the plight

26:42.208 --> 26:44.291
of the average Jack or Jane.

26:44.375 --> 26:46.208
People like my parents were

26:46.291 --> 26:48.792
[sobbing]
humble, good people..

26:50.750 --> 26:53.375
- Get her a soda water.
- Yes.

26:56.041 --> 26:59.166
I'm sorry.
This is so strange.

26:59.250 --> 27:01.709
You been cryin'
like this regular?

27:01.792 --> 27:03.000
Nick's in Europe.

27:03.083 --> 27:04.542
I suppose I miss him.

27:04.625 --> 27:05.792
Feelin' queasy, too?

27:05.875 --> 27:08.041
Achy, like you got the flu?

27:08.125 --> 27:09.208
Yeah. That's it.

27:09.291 --> 27:10.583
(Violet)
'You had it, too?'

27:10.667 --> 27:13.375
I did. Once.

27:13.458 --> 27:17.000
You're knocked up, kid.

27:17.083 --> 27:19.166
No.

27:19.250 --> 27:21.625
What would you know about it?
You don't have kids.

27:21.709 --> 27:24.375
It doesn't always have to
end that way.

27:24.458 --> 27:27.041
But judging by the way you
filled out through the middle

27:27.125 --> 27:29.875
it's too
late
for you.

27:29.959 --> 27:31.834
I don't know what I'll do.

27:31.917 --> 27:33.917
I've almost run
through my savings.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.166
Nick's gone

27:35.250 --> 27:37.792
and I've been
too ill to get a job.

27:37.875 --> 27:39.917
What about your humble parents?

27:41.709 --> 27:43.041
They're gone.

27:44.625 --> 27:47.125
Uh...cigarette?

27:47.208 --> 27:48.333
Scotch?

27:48.417 --> 27:50.375
No, thank you.

27:50.458 --> 27:54.125
Kid, how much for a song?

27:54.208 --> 27:55.583
How many do you want?

27:55.667 --> 27:57.834
How many you got?

28:01.667 --> 28:03.417
It was Nick Bartleby's baby.

28:03.500 --> 28:05.250
Aimee's a Bartleby.

28:05.333 --> 28:06.583
That ought a blow her socks off.

28:06.667 --> 28:08.125
I know I'd be thrilled.

28:08.208 --> 28:10.291
Rich guy doesn't wanna set up
camp with his side dish?

28:10.375 --> 28:11.875
And her illegitimate child.

28:11.959 --> 28:15.041
Gorgeous, rich man
seeks poor songwriter

28:15.125 --> 28:18.041
to birth scion and
live
in marital bliss?

28:19.709 --> 28:21.667
I don't think so.

28:32.375 --> 28:34.500
Are you dating anyone?

28:34.583 --> 28:36.500
Ray came through town.

28:38.208 --> 28:39.750
Uh-oh. Who's he?

28:39.834 --> 28:42.917
I want better for you, is all.

28:43.000 --> 28:46.208
Well, there was this DA.

28:46.291 --> 28:48.041
Kite.

28:48.125 --> 28:49.291
He was a good one, but--

28:49.375 --> 28:51.625
He was too good, right?

28:51.709 --> 28:53.250
Not for me. I'm a lightweight.

28:53.333 --> 28:54.834
- She is.
- Alright.

28:54.917 --> 28:56.458
Remember when
you broke your jaw?

28:56.542 --> 28:58.250
She was always into something.

28:58.333 --> 29:00.458
What happened? You fell, right?

29:00.542 --> 29:02.083
A broken jaw is horrible.

29:02.166 --> 29:04.750
She used to run out in the
middle of the night, I can't

29:04.834 --> 29:06.834
believe I even slept,
I'd worry so much.

29:06.917 --> 29:08.625
I was attacked.

29:08.709 --> 29:10.917
I didn't fall.

29:13.291 --> 29:15.250
We lived
in some bad neighborhoods.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.625
How about I check on our order?

29:21.250 --> 29:22.917
The look on your face,
all night, what?

29:23.000 --> 29:24.333
He doesn't even know
that you're an
alcoholic?

29:24.417 --> 29:26.834
Was. You could try
being polite to him.

29:26.917 --> 29:29.000
- This is my new husband.
- For the next month.

29:29.083 --> 29:31.166
Oh, stop it.
Maybe I fail, but I try.

29:31.250 --> 29:33.208
It's more than failed
when you bring home guys

29:33.291 --> 29:35.083
who hit you,
who steal from
you.

29:35.166 --> 29:36.542
But I try.

29:36.625 --> 29:40.709
Okay? I find happiness,
if only for a little while.

29:40.792 --> 29:42.834
That's more
than you can say.

29:42.917 --> 29:44.542
At least I'm not alone.

29:44.625 --> 29:46.333
I'd rather be alone
than clinging to a man

29:46.417 --> 29:48.208
who doesn't even know me.

29:48.291 --> 29:49.667
Well, as usual,
you're so much better.

29:49.750 --> 29:51.000
Stop.

29:51.083 --> 29:52.709
How long did you and the DA
keep it together, huh?

29:52.792 --> 29:54.875
- More than a month?
- I can't go to your wedding.

29:54.959 --> 29:56.667
What, work
is so
important?

29:56.750 --> 29:59.375
Because I-I can't smile
and-and pose for
pictures

29:59.458 --> 30:01.959
and pretend that
everything's
fine when it's not.

30:02.041 --> 30:05.625
I just want one night
of happiness with you there.

30:05.709 --> 30:07.000
Is that so wrong?

30:07.083 --> 30:09.458
Have I done so badly
I can't have that?

30:09.542 --> 30:12.083
Well, I
can't
give it to
you.

30:16.083 --> 30:18.375
You deserve it, too, Lilly.

30:18.458 --> 30:21.458
To just...be happy.

30:59.917 --> 31:02.750
(male on phone)
'I'm out right now.
Leave your message.'

31:02.834 --> 31:05.000
Kite.

31:05.083 --> 31:07.750
Lilly Rush.

31:07.834 --> 31:12.000
Well, you're workin' late,
I bet.

31:12.083 --> 31:13.750
Look, I want to say something

31:13.834 --> 31:16.417
and I know the ship
has sailed with us

31:16.500 --> 31:21.500
so that's not why I'm calling.

31:21.583 --> 31:25.083
[sighing]
I, uh.

31:25.166 --> 31:26.500
I'm just gonna say it.

31:28.834 --> 31:33.041
Look, I know it's on me,
how we ended things.

31:34.041 --> 31:35.333
I got flipped out.

31:37.250 --> 31:39.000
I just..

31:41.125 --> 31:44.500
...I just want to not end up
like my mom, you know?

31:44.583 --> 31:47.458
But I don't wanna end up
like this either.

31:49.500 --> 31:51.250
So, I'm done.

31:51.333 --> 31:55.959
I'm done with having
to walk home alone.

31:56.041 --> 31:59.000
She can't do it, but I can.

31:59.083 --> 32:00.792
I can change.

32:02.208 --> 32:04.291
(kite on phone)
'Lilly?'

32:12.583 --> 32:14.333
I'm related to the Bartlebys?

32:14.417 --> 32:16.125
- Yes.
- Definitely?

32:16.208 --> 32:18.709
(Valens)
'We got a lead from
Carmela La Fleur's biographer'

32:18.792 --> 32:21.083
on the doctor who helped
girls in trouble back then.

32:21.166 --> 32:25.250
This is the doctor's record
of your grandmother's birth.

32:26.959 --> 32:30.667
"Baby girl. Eight pounds,
three ounces. Rose."

32:30.750 --> 32:31.834
That's my grandmother.

32:31.917 --> 32:33.208
There's a quilt

32:33.291 --> 32:35.500
from the boarding
house
where Violet lived.

32:35.583 --> 32:36.750
Says "Rosie" on it.

32:36.834 --> 32:39.208
Maybe Violet made it.

32:39.291 --> 32:41.208
So why did I grow
up the way I did

32:41.291 --> 32:44.291
and the Bartlebys grew up
the way they did?

32:44.375 --> 32:45.875
We're gonna find out.

32:45.959 --> 32:48.834
Your great-grandmother
was a songwriter.

32:49.834 --> 32:51.667
She published a song called

32:51.750 --> 32:53.542
"300 flowers."

32:53.625 --> 32:55.500
What's it sound like?

32:57.291 --> 32:59.917
It's beautiful.

33:00.000 --> 33:01.333
I'll have to find it.

33:02.792 --> 33:05.375
Muriel Bartleby's gang
of lawyers just called.

33:05.458 --> 33:07.125
'Says you've got 20 minutes.'

33:07.208 --> 33:08.542
And they're timing it.

33:10.291 --> 33:13.291
That sounds like
we're being summoned.

33:24.500 --> 33:27.750
I hear we've got 20
minutes
with you, Muriel.

33:27.834 --> 33:31.750
I, uh...I don't see
people, as a rule.

33:31.834 --> 33:33.542
Thanks for the exception.

33:34.834 --> 33:37.500
Do you know
about our
family?

33:37.583 --> 33:38.917
My brother had the most

33:39.000 --> 33:41.750
marvelous parties in this house.

33:41.834 --> 33:44.583
The walls pulsed with life.

33:45.667 --> 33:46.875
Now look.

33:46.959 --> 33:50.083
Violet Polley
had your brother Nick's
child.

33:50.166 --> 33:53.291
People always wanted to
claim
our name as their own.

33:53.375 --> 33:54.750
People like Violet?

33:54.834 --> 33:58.458
We were so careful not
to allow a crooked
branch

33:58.542 --> 34:00.333
on the family tree.

34:01.750 --> 34:03.750
Now there are
no Bartlebys
left.

34:03.834 --> 34:06.792
Except for Violet's descendants.

34:06.875 --> 34:08.542
(Jeffries)
'Sounds like your brother
will do anything'

34:08.625 --> 34:11.125
'to protect the family name.'

34:13.208 --> 34:16.625
My brother had nothing
to do with Violet's
death.

34:16.709 --> 34:18.166
How do you know?

34:18.250 --> 34:21.291
Because I saw him
wash his hands of her.

34:21.375 --> 34:22.458
When?

34:22.542 --> 34:26.166
Some time after the crash.

34:28.875 --> 34:31.667
Violet was right here

34:31.750 --> 34:33.083
in this room

34:33.166 --> 34:35.125
with her baby.

34:37.041 --> 34:39.000
Daddy gave it to me!
I won't sell it!

34:39.083 --> 34:40.291
Muriel!

34:40.375 --> 34:41.542
'Behave!'

34:43.625 --> 34:45.166
Our banker, Mr. Treehorn

34:45.250 --> 34:48.625
threw himself out of his
sixth floor window today.

34:48.709 --> 34:50.875
Buck up, Bartleby.
It'll turn around.

34:50.959 --> 34:52.625
It's the end
of the world.

34:54.583 --> 34:57.166
Violet Polley is here
to see you, sir.

34:57.250 --> 34:58.917
Tell her I'm away.

35:00.917 --> 35:04.667
You should see her, sir.

35:04.750 --> 35:06.750
Get out of my house, Spyczyk.

35:06.834 --> 35:09.041
- Sir?
- I cannot afford you.

35:09.125 --> 35:10.166
You are dismissed.

35:27.333 --> 35:28.875
Violet.

35:28.959 --> 35:32.917
You've been home a while now,
and you haven't rang me back.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.875
It ain't on me, kid.

35:34.959 --> 35:37.375
Me and him are
strictly platonic.

35:38.542 --> 35:41.166
What is that?

35:41.250 --> 35:43.041
This is our daughter.

35:47.875 --> 35:49.667
I know you meant to be
through with me, Nick

35:49.750 --> 35:51.709
but this is our child.

35:51.792 --> 35:54.125
I named her Rose after
the roses you gave me.

35:54.208 --> 35:55.709
This is scandalous.

35:55.792 --> 35:57.041
Then marry me.

35:57.125 --> 35:58.542
Violet, that's ridiculous.

35:58.625 --> 35:59.875
(Violet)
'You're a grown man.'

35:59.959 --> 36:01.333
You can do as you please.

36:01.417 --> 36:04.375
I did. And now I'm through.

36:07.125 --> 36:08.834
If you won't marry
me, take Rose.

36:08.917 --> 36:11.458
I can't provide for her
alone.
I need your help.

36:11.542 --> 36:14.583
I can't give you anything!
I can't help you!

36:14.667 --> 36:17.083
'I can't even
help myself.'

36:17.166 --> 36:18.625
You can take my clock.

36:19.959 --> 36:21.917
It's made of gold.

36:38.834 --> 36:40.917
You're no kind of man, Bartleby.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.500
Why don't you save
the day, Carmela?

36:42.583 --> 36:44.250
Take the baby yourself,
and raise it backstage

36:44.333 --> 36:46.583
with your opium pipe
and your fairies.

36:51.375 --> 36:55.500
We, uh...we could've
taken the little baby.

36:55.583 --> 36:57.375
'We survived.'

36:57.458 --> 36:58.625
When was this?

36:58.709 --> 37:00.583
Christmas day.

37:01.875 --> 37:03.291
You gave Violet

37:03.375 --> 37:04.625
your gold clock?

37:04.709 --> 37:07.041
A child's idea of help.

37:07.125 --> 37:09.709
Who knows how much
it was worth?

37:11.125 --> 37:14.625
Seventy-five dollars.

37:14.709 --> 37:17.000
Daniel, we'd like to
take
the clock in with us.

37:17.083 --> 37:18.375
I'd rather you didn't.

37:18.458 --> 37:19.709
Why is that, Daniel?

37:19.792 --> 37:21.291
Well, it's a family heirloom.

37:21.375 --> 37:24.417
You know the story
Felix
told you isn't true.

37:24.500 --> 37:26.208
Bartleby didn't
give him that
clock.

37:26.291 --> 37:28.291
Well, it's what
he always told me.

37:28.375 --> 37:31.333
Except that one time
when he told you the truth.

37:32.709 --> 37:34.000
You said your
grandfather wanted

37:34.083 --> 37:37.291
to tell you his
stories
before he died.

37:37.375 --> 37:38.917
To get them off his chest.

37:39.000 --> 37:42.166
(Valens)
'We think he told you
about a murder, Daniel.'

37:42.250 --> 37:45.500
Felix Spyczyk
was an honorable man.

37:45.583 --> 37:48.166
He was the last one seen
with her, day she died.

37:48.250 --> 37:50.000
He took the clock from her.

37:50.083 --> 37:52.166
Why do you have to do this?

37:52.250 --> 37:55.041
He's gone now, he's long gone,
and he can't be punished.

37:55.125 --> 37:57.500
Violet's family
has been punished.

37:57.583 --> 37:59.917
Their lives would
have been so different

38:00.000 --> 38:01.667
'if they had
her around.'

38:01.750 --> 38:04.041
They deserve to put it to bed.

38:11.750 --> 38:15.125
I thought about
destroying the tape.

38:15.208 --> 38:17.709
'But it's
what he wanted.'

38:17.792 --> 38:19.792
He wanted to tell the truth.

38:23.125 --> 38:24.709
So, here.

38:34.792 --> 38:37.375
(Daniel on tape)
'That's okay, grandfather.
You can rest now.'

38:37.458 --> 38:41.083
(Felix on tape)
'I want to say it,
what I did to her.'

38:41.166 --> 38:42.709
(Daniel)
'It's okay.'

38:42.792 --> 38:45.583
(Felix)
'It was after she
left Bartleby's'

38:45.667 --> 38:50.500
'with nothing but a crying
baby
and that gold clock.'

38:58.166 --> 39:03.291
It's okay, baby Rose.
It's okay.

39:03.375 --> 39:04.959
It's okay.

39:09.166 --> 39:11.917
- He is scum.
- Yes, he is.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.500
People think he is like God,
all of them

39:14.583 --> 39:19.375
in their beautiful
house, Bartlebys!

39:19.458 --> 39:21.291
We know the truth
about Bartleby

39:21.375 --> 39:25.458
and what he did to you
and your little baby.

39:25.542 --> 39:27.333
We can tell the world.

39:27.417 --> 39:29.917
What are you
suggesting,
Mr. Spyczyk?

39:30.000 --> 39:32.208
I will tell him,
give us money

39:32.291 --> 39:33.917
or we tell newspapers.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.917
He has no money.
You heard him.

39:36.000 --> 39:38.834
These people survive
like cockroach. He has money.

39:38.917 --> 39:42.125
He can always find what
he needs, Nick Bartleby.

39:42.208 --> 39:43.625
No. I've made it this far.

39:43.709 --> 39:47.500
- I'm a girl who finds a
way.
- Wake up.

39:47.583 --> 39:50.625
You have baby and no money.

39:50.709 --> 39:52.458
Today I don't, but tomorrow--

39:52.542 --> 39:54.208
This is good plan.

39:54.291 --> 39:57.291
This is how to do
as the rich do in America.

39:57.375 --> 39:59.166
'Squeezing them.'

39:59.250 --> 40:03.125
I'm not that sort of person.

40:03.208 --> 40:05.291
You take clock already.

40:05.375 --> 40:07.709
You let him buy you.

40:07.792 --> 40:09.500
I'd rather find a way
to make it on my own

40:09.583 --> 40:11.500
than be a lowly blackmailer.

40:11.583 --> 40:12.792
I am not lowly!

40:12.875 --> 40:15.417
Blackmailing makes you
as bad as Bartleby.

40:17.208 --> 40:20.458
I'm not like Bartleby!

40:22.959 --> 40:24.250
I'm not.

40:31.583 --> 40:33.375
Rosie.

41:08.667 --> 41:11.291
'Alright, moppet.
Alright.'

44:15.959 --> 44:17.000
