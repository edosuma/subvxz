WEBVTT

00:06.800 --> 00:08.650
(all groaning)

00:08.850 --> 00:11.520
So the pitcher guy is trying
to hit the wooden thing?

00:11.720 --> 00:14.060
The bowler tries
to hit the wicket.

00:14.260 --> 00:15.830
(imitating Uncle Tunde):
Oh, the bowler is trying
to hit the wicket.

00:16.030 --> 00:18.610
Everything about cricket
sounds made up.

00:19.450 --> 00:20.900
You should join
our fantasy league.

00:21.100 --> 00:22.300
I barely know the rules.

00:22.500 --> 00:24.490
That is why I am inviting you.

00:26.660 --> 00:28.010
It is time for me to head home.

00:28.210 --> 00:31.310
Kemi likes to rub my abs
as she drifts off to sleep.

00:31.510 --> 00:33.210
Olu does that, too.

00:33.410 --> 00:35.260
But on the belly of a sea otter.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.780
Hey. You guys still spending
every night together?

00:38.980 --> 00:39.790
Yes.

00:39.990 --> 00:41.220
Kemi demands passionate nights

00:41.420 --> 00:42.590
and pancakes in the morning.

00:42.790 --> 00:44.520
You two sound like you're
already married.

00:44.720 --> 00:45.920
When are you gonna throw
a ring on her finger?

00:46.130 --> 00:49.430
I would love to,
but it is not the right time.

00:49.630 --> 00:51.400
Kemi deserves to marry
a head pharmacist,

00:51.600 --> 00:53.200
not some lowly pill jockey.

00:53.400 --> 00:54.930
A handsome pill jockey.

00:55.130 --> 00:57.300
Oh, Bob. You're too kind.

00:57.500 --> 00:58.870
Do you love her?
Yes.

00:59.070 --> 01:00.340
Does she love you?
Yes.

01:00.540 --> 01:01.970
Her and your mom still trying
to kill each other?

01:02.180 --> 01:03.610
Only sometimes.

01:03.810 --> 01:04.940
That's an improvement.

01:05.140 --> 01:06.010
You hear that, Pastor?

01:06.210 --> 01:07.150
Sounds like wedding bells.

01:07.350 --> 01:08.450
And I happen to know someone

01:08.650 --> 01:11.080
who can perform
a riveting ceremony.

01:11.280 --> 01:12.120
It is him.

01:12.320 --> 01:14.470
He's talking about himself.

01:15.340 --> 01:18.160
Just discussing this,
my hands have begun to sweat.

01:18.360 --> 01:19.490
Well, don't be nervous,

01:19.690 --> 01:20.730
it's the right decision.

01:20.930 --> 01:23.160
Sometimes you just
got to take that leap.

01:23.360 --> 01:24.530
Proverbs 18:22 says,

01:24.730 --> 01:26.630
"He who finds a wife,
finds a good thing

01:26.830 --> 01:28.830
and obtains favor
from the Lord."

01:29.030 --> 01:32.240
Look at that, you got
Jesus as your wingman.

01:32.440 --> 01:33.570
I am going to do it.

01:33.770 --> 01:35.210
I am going to propose to Kemi.

01:35.410 --> 01:36.680
Let's hear it for Chuey!

01:36.880 --> 01:38.340
(cheering)
Congratulations.

01:38.540 --> 01:40.250
I will take Mummy ring shopping.

01:40.450 --> 01:42.400
She and Kemi have
the same size fingers.

01:43.300 --> 01:45.950
No idea why you know that,
but we're happy for you.

01:46.150 --> 01:47.420
Thank you, Bob.

01:47.620 --> 01:49.440
Anytime, pal.

01:52.180 --> 01:53.230
That's nice, huh?

01:53.430 --> 01:55.290
Yes. And you talked him into it.

01:55.490 --> 01:56.560
What does that mean?

01:56.760 --> 02:00.120
Nothing.
I'm sure it will be fine.

02:03.720 --> 02:07.760
("Ifanla" by Sola Akingbola
playing)

02:28.840 --> 02:32.370
Mmm. This wine is delicious.

02:32.570 --> 02:34.030
Ah, it was a gift
from Chukwuemeka.

02:34.230 --> 02:35.970
Why would another man
send you wine?

02:36.170 --> 02:38.040
Well, that's between
me and Chuey.

02:38.240 --> 02:41.360
This does not concern you?

02:42.090 --> 02:43.510
It's nothing bad.

02:43.710 --> 02:48.000
All I can say is...
love is in the air.

02:48.930 --> 02:50.850
This does not concern you?

02:51.050 --> 02:52.250
I am not worried.

02:52.450 --> 02:54.540
Bob's secrets are always boring.

02:55.670 --> 02:57.310
Okay.

02:58.670 --> 03:01.010
Boy, egusi's good.

03:04.610 --> 03:05.330
Just say it.

03:05.530 --> 03:07.470
It's a thank-you gift.

03:07.670 --> 03:08.830
Now, don't tell anybody,

03:09.030 --> 03:10.300
but you're looking at the guy

03:10.500 --> 03:12.040
who encouraged Chukwuemeka
to propose to Kemi.

03:12.240 --> 03:13.210
(silverware drops)

03:13.410 --> 03:15.260
So I am looking at a fool?

03:16.360 --> 03:18.480
I'm going to finish
this in my room.

03:18.680 --> 03:20.850
This is a good thing.
You don't have to leave.

03:21.050 --> 03:22.680
I can see that
you feel that way.

03:22.880 --> 03:24.630
That's why I'm leaving.

03:25.500 --> 03:27.820
Kemi has no interest
in getting married again.

03:28.020 --> 03:29.220
If he does this,

03:29.420 --> 03:30.960
their relationship
will never be the same.

03:31.160 --> 03:32.230
Hey, have a little faith.

03:32.430 --> 03:34.160
They might beat
the odds like us.

03:34.360 --> 03:36.530
An American guy follows this
Nigerian nurse on a bus

03:36.730 --> 03:37.760
with a bag full of socks?

03:37.960 --> 03:39.870
A lot of people
doubted that love story.

03:40.070 --> 03:42.600
I am still amazed you made it.

03:42.800 --> 03:44.120
Cheers.

03:47.860 --> 03:50.740
We do not anticipate this unit
being available for long.

03:50.940 --> 03:52.080
It is within
walking distance

03:52.280 --> 03:54.950
of two coffee shops
and a dog park.

03:55.150 --> 03:57.180
Oh, I would love
to have a dog.

03:57.380 --> 03:59.320
We do not allow pets.

03:59.520 --> 04:03.470
But you are .3 miles
away from seeing them.
(chuckles)

04:04.470 --> 04:05.420
(gasps)

04:05.620 --> 04:07.930
I have always
wanted a reading nook.

04:08.130 --> 04:10.200
Ah, it is also the perfect spot

04:10.400 --> 04:12.870
for you and your new neighbor
to play cards

04:13.070 --> 04:14.000
and shoot the breeze.

04:14.200 --> 04:15.300
(laughing)

04:15.500 --> 04:16.870
It would be nice to have
you living above us.

04:17.070 --> 04:21.240
You have very light
footsteps, like a cat.
Oh.

04:21.440 --> 04:23.140
When I lived above his garage,

04:23.340 --> 04:25.110
Goodwin insisted
on me being quiet.

04:25.310 --> 04:27.210
From the hours of 10:00 p.m.
to 8:00 a.m.,

04:27.410 --> 04:29.280
I had to sneeze
into a pillow.

04:29.480 --> 04:32.120
We were going to raise the rent
on the next tenant,

04:32.320 --> 04:33.790
but since you are like family,

04:33.990 --> 04:36.860
we will give you
the "like family" discount.

04:37.060 --> 04:39.990
I'm sure he does not
expect any special treatment.

04:40.190 --> 04:41.930
I do not.
Good answer.

04:42.130 --> 04:44.000
Ooh, would it be okay

04:44.200 --> 04:46.060
if I put up some
whimsical wallpaper?

04:46.260 --> 04:49.270
It is your castle,
you are the king.

04:49.470 --> 04:51.590
But there will be
an extra charge.

04:52.290 --> 04:53.810
Should I get a lease
for you to sign?

04:54.010 --> 04:57.480
Today? I-I was not counting
on finding a place so quickly.

04:57.680 --> 04:59.080
We are not lowering the rent.

04:59.280 --> 05:00.250
The price is the price.

05:00.450 --> 05:02.420
I just want to take my time.

05:02.620 --> 05:06.080
What if we took $200
off your first month?

05:06.280 --> 05:08.770
Stop hitting me, I like him!

05:09.740 --> 05:11.610
(chuckles)

05:16.010 --> 05:17.560
Hello.
Hey.

05:17.760 --> 05:20.870
I brought you potato skins
from the cafeteria.

05:21.070 --> 05:22.600
Oh, thank you.
KEMI: Mm-hmm.

05:22.800 --> 05:25.870
I was going to eat it,
but, uh, I cannot today.

05:26.070 --> 05:28.460
Okay, thanks.

05:30.460 --> 05:32.680
Because I have big plans later.

05:32.880 --> 05:34.380
That's nice.

05:34.580 --> 05:35.760
Mm.

05:37.430 --> 05:39.720
Ask me what I'm doing tonight!

05:39.920 --> 05:42.860
Why? It always involves
a naked Chuey and coconut oil.

05:43.060 --> 05:46.120
They do not use coconut oil,
it gives him a rash.

05:46.320 --> 05:48.590
I should not know that.

05:48.790 --> 05:50.730
And now I know that.

05:50.930 --> 05:54.630
My man is taking me out
for a posh dinner.

05:54.830 --> 05:56.400
No.

05:56.600 --> 05:58.370
And he's picking me up
in a limousine.

05:58.570 --> 06:00.070
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

06:00.270 --> 06:01.240
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

06:01.440 --> 06:03.680
Sounds romantic.
Where you going?

06:03.880 --> 06:05.110
Mayfield's.

06:05.310 --> 06:06.850
Ooh, that fancy place
on the water?

06:07.050 --> 06:11.150
Yes. Chukwuemeka is obviously
going to expect me to put out.

06:11.350 --> 06:12.920
Which I will do
in the following ways:

06:13.120 --> 06:14.940
First...
You cannot go there.

06:15.440 --> 06:17.960
Um, that place is terrible.

06:18.160 --> 06:19.890
Bob and I got food poisoning.

06:20.090 --> 06:21.290
I will be fine.

06:21.490 --> 06:24.130
I always sniff my oysters
before I shoot them.

06:24.330 --> 06:26.550
The valet scratched Bob's car.

06:27.780 --> 06:30.070
Why are you trying
to spoil my fun?

06:30.270 --> 06:31.370
You sound jealous.

06:31.570 --> 06:34.440
Yes, I am very jealous

06:34.640 --> 06:36.680
that he gets to spend time
with you.

06:36.880 --> 06:39.040
Please, have dinner
with me instead.

06:39.240 --> 06:40.980
That is so sweet.

06:41.180 --> 06:42.280
You want to spend time with me.

06:42.480 --> 06:43.920
Let me think.

06:44.120 --> 06:48.220
Abishola, sexy boyfriend?

06:48.420 --> 06:49.710
You lose.

06:51.170 --> 06:53.280
Enjoy your sad life.

06:54.840 --> 06:56.340
You gonna eat those?

06:57.250 --> 06:58.780
Thank you.

07:02.180 --> 07:03.440
Over the past three weeks,

07:03.640 --> 07:05.870
engagement with our
"Sock Lovers" campaign

07:06.070 --> 07:08.970
has gone up 35% among those

07:09.170 --> 07:13.730
who self-identify
as single and... into feet.

07:14.700 --> 07:17.030
God bless those freaks,
they're loyal customers.

07:17.870 --> 07:19.280
Why do they have
to call them freaks?

07:19.480 --> 07:21.900
Maybe they're just trying
to live their lives.

07:24.110 --> 07:25.560
Okay, what's next?

07:25.760 --> 07:27.060
Really? It's 4:45
on a Friday.

07:27.260 --> 07:28.690
Don't you want to get home
to the wife and kids?

07:28.890 --> 07:31.030
Yeah, they're probably
wondering where Daddy is.

07:31.230 --> 07:32.570
Go home, Daddy.

07:32.770 --> 07:35.430
Tiwa and the kids went
to her mother's for the weekend.

07:35.630 --> 07:38.370
Which is good because
there is so much work to do.

07:38.570 --> 07:40.040
Oh, I get it.

07:40.240 --> 07:43.460
No wife, no Kofo, you don't
want to face the empty house.

07:44.790 --> 07:46.340
You know, sometimes
I put on the Food Network

07:46.550 --> 07:50.470
so I can pretend...
I'm eating with someone.

07:52.330 --> 07:53.420
It's got to be a little weird

07:53.620 --> 07:55.240
not having your buddy
out in the garage.

07:56.140 --> 07:58.190
When my kids left home, I didn't
know what to do with myself.

07:58.390 --> 08:00.340
Kofo is not my child,
or my buddy.

08:01.280 --> 08:03.460
He was a tenant, who still
owes me a cleaning fee.

08:03.660 --> 08:05.560
It's okay to miss him.

08:05.760 --> 08:07.970
And it's okay
to let us go home.

08:08.170 --> 08:10.990
So many things are okay.

08:12.490 --> 08:14.210
Let us go over
the inventory again.

08:14.410 --> 08:16.310
Well, I gave it a shot.
Good luck, guys.

08:16.510 --> 08:17.640
I'm sorry you're lonely, honey,

08:17.840 --> 08:20.310
but I got to get
out of these pantyhose.

08:20.510 --> 08:22.180
All right, great week,
everybody.

08:22.380 --> 08:24.380
Sit down, Douglas.
(moans)

08:24.580 --> 08:27.050
You will help Christina
and I finish up.
CHRISTINA: Sounds great.

08:27.250 --> 08:28.590
We'll order takeout,

08:28.790 --> 08:30.890
we'll sit cross-legged
in a circle,

08:31.090 --> 08:32.360
listen to some Enya.

08:32.560 --> 08:34.730
Thank you, Christina,
you may go home.

08:34.930 --> 08:36.610
See you, sucker.

08:42.750 --> 08:45.400
We were supposed to be
closer to the window.

08:45.600 --> 08:47.740
Oh, that's okay.

08:47.940 --> 08:49.740
I can see the reflection
of the river

08:49.940 --> 08:52.610
shimmering off
your beautiful head.

08:52.810 --> 08:55.380
I just want this night
to be special.

08:55.580 --> 08:57.350
Oh, it will be. For your wallet.

08:57.550 --> 08:59.920
I haven't eaten since breakfast.

09:00.120 --> 09:01.650
There they are.

09:01.850 --> 09:03.260
Without making it too obvious,

09:03.460 --> 09:05.520
get us as close as you can
to the bald guy.

09:05.720 --> 09:07.160
What are you going to do?

09:07.360 --> 09:09.060
Destroy their lives.

09:09.260 --> 09:11.110
She's kidding.

09:12.380 --> 09:13.770
Chuey wanted us
here for support.

09:13.970 --> 09:15.530
If you didn't want to do that,
you shouldn't have come.

09:15.730 --> 09:17.070
I need to be here because
when this goes wrong,

09:17.270 --> 09:19.200
I'll be able to tell Kemi
it was all your fault.

09:19.400 --> 09:20.970
(chuckles) Great.

09:21.170 --> 09:22.140
Look who it is!

09:22.340 --> 09:23.540
Our favorite lovebirds.

09:23.740 --> 09:25.310
Whose lives we
will not meddle in.

09:25.510 --> 09:26.980
Hello, my friends.

09:27.180 --> 09:29.310
What are you doing at
my romantic restaurant?

09:29.510 --> 09:31.550
Uh, just having dinner.

09:31.750 --> 09:32.550
Pretend we're not here.

09:32.750 --> 09:34.020
Unless you need us,

09:34.220 --> 09:35.650
then we are always here.

09:35.850 --> 09:37.860
You are truly
obsessed with me.

09:38.060 --> 09:39.660
It is like <i>Single White Female</i>

09:39.860 --> 09:42.110
except you are neither
single nor white.

09:43.310 --> 09:45.030
Kemi, relax.

09:45.230 --> 09:46.060
More champagne?

09:46.260 --> 09:47.850
Fine.

09:51.450 --> 09:53.460
Cheers to my haters.

09:54.420 --> 09:56.470
It's looking pretty
romantic over there.

09:56.680 --> 10:00.450
Poor Kemi. She has no
idea what is coming.

10:00.650 --> 10:02.770
Hello! Stop looking at us!

10:04.930 --> 10:06.420
Kemi.

10:06.620 --> 10:07.790
It's happening.

10:07.990 --> 10:10.160
Oh, my God.
It is happening.

10:10.360 --> 10:13.760
I cannot imagine spending
my life with anyone but you.

10:13.960 --> 10:16.190
I cannot imagine you
spending your life

10:16.390 --> 10:18.300
with anyone but me either.

10:18.500 --> 10:20.270
I love you with all my heart.

10:20.470 --> 10:21.880
What are you doing?

10:22.920 --> 10:23.990
Oh, I see.

10:24.850 --> 10:26.170
That is a beautiful ring.

10:26.370 --> 10:29.520
Almost as beautiful as
the woman who will wear it.

10:32.330 --> 10:33.250
Kemi...

10:33.450 --> 10:35.600
will you marry me?

10:38.770 --> 10:40.500
You are a wonderful man.

10:42.810 --> 10:44.520
But no, thank you.

10:44.720 --> 10:46.520
Kemi. Kemi?

10:46.730 --> 10:50.880
Kemi! If it helps,
I had nothing to do with this.

11:00.360 --> 11:02.540
I took these on my way out.

11:02.740 --> 11:04.010
Thank you.

11:04.210 --> 11:05.540
While I was running,

11:05.740 --> 11:08.830
I did not think to throw
some oysters in my purse.

11:09.830 --> 11:13.190
Why would Chukwuemeka even
consider proposing to me?

11:13.390 --> 11:17.160
Because he is a fool who was
influenced by another fool.

11:17.360 --> 11:18.960
Marriage is not for me.
I know.

11:19.160 --> 11:20.260
And that is okay.

11:20.460 --> 11:21.730
I like my life the way it is.

11:21.930 --> 11:23.060
Exactly what I told Bob.

11:23.260 --> 11:24.830
Chukwuemeka deserves better.

11:25.030 --> 11:27.250
What are you talking about?

11:28.150 --> 11:29.700
Never mind.

11:29.900 --> 11:31.670
That is a ridiculous
thing to say.

11:31.870 --> 11:33.770
There is no one better.

11:33.970 --> 11:36.340
My husband was terrible,

11:36.540 --> 11:37.810
but I was never
a good wife to him.

11:38.010 --> 11:40.410
I did not have dinner
waiting for him every night.

11:40.610 --> 11:42.720
Or have perfectly
manicured hands

11:42.920 --> 11:45.620
to rub his fat, crusty feet.

11:45.820 --> 11:48.550
You are not the reason
your marriage failed.

11:48.750 --> 11:50.120
I am.

11:50.320 --> 11:51.760
A good wife is selfless,

11:51.960 --> 11:53.490
puts her husband first,

11:53.690 --> 11:56.700
does not turn off her phone and
spend all night at the casino.

11:56.900 --> 12:01.230
Chukwuemeka loves you
exactly the way that you are.

12:01.430 --> 12:05.320
If he wanted a good wife,
he would not be with you.

12:06.520 --> 12:08.420
Thank you for those sweet words.

12:09.660 --> 12:11.040
So you're saying I
should marry him?

12:11.240 --> 12:12.280
Only if you want to.

12:12.480 --> 12:13.480
But I told you I did not.

12:13.680 --> 12:14.980
But you did not for
the wrong reasons.

12:15.180 --> 12:17.570
Okay, shut up, you are
confusing me.

12:18.730 --> 12:20.770
And you forgot butter.

12:24.910 --> 12:26.670
You are a good friend.

12:32.480 --> 12:33.470
Mr. Wheeler,
I wanted to show you

12:33.670 --> 12:35.570
my idea for our
rollout campaign.

12:35.770 --> 12:36.740
Fine.

12:36.940 --> 12:38.200
I will come back another time.

12:38.400 --> 12:39.670
I got time. Show me.

12:39.870 --> 12:41.770
No, thank you.
Your eyebrows are raised.

12:41.970 --> 12:43.440
That is your yelling face.

12:43.640 --> 12:46.510
No, that is his "got in a fight
with Abishola" face.

12:46.710 --> 12:47.350
Maybe both.

12:47.550 --> 12:48.880
Stop looking at my face!

12:49.080 --> 12:50.470
There is the yelling.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.350
When we are neighbors,

12:52.550 --> 12:55.220
these are the work moments
we can discuss over brewskis.

12:55.420 --> 12:57.520
I am still not sure about
taking the apartment.

12:57.720 --> 12:59.620
Why not?
It is a big commitment.

12:59.820 --> 13:01.590
What, are you scared
of being happy?

13:01.790 --> 13:03.460
This man's offering you
a beautiful life here.

13:03.660 --> 13:04.900
You're just gonna run away?

13:05.100 --> 13:06.300
Why is he angry with me?

13:06.500 --> 13:07.900
It is not about you.

13:08.100 --> 13:11.750
But underneath his screaming
is a great deal of wisdom.

13:12.960 --> 13:14.140
Do you like the apartment?

13:14.340 --> 13:16.370
Yes.
Can you see yourself there?

13:16.570 --> 13:18.380
Yes.
Then stop thinking with this

13:18.580 --> 13:20.350
and start thinking with this.

13:20.550 --> 13:23.230
Oh, Bob. You are a poet.

13:24.430 --> 13:26.380
I am sick of living
my life in fear.

13:26.580 --> 13:28.190
Uncle, I will take
the apartment.

13:28.390 --> 13:30.160
Wonderful!
BOB: Good for you.

13:30.360 --> 13:32.120
Was choosing happiness
so freakin' hard?

13:32.320 --> 13:35.210
I accept your angry
congratulations.

13:36.110 --> 13:37.360
And I am
getting a puppy.

13:37.560 --> 13:39.360
Uh, my wife has made it clear
that is not negotiable.

13:39.560 --> 13:40.500
BOB:
Oh, for God's sakes,

13:40.700 --> 13:42.070
let him have the damn puppy!

13:42.270 --> 13:44.790
All right, I'll see
what I can do!

13:49.860 --> 13:51.580
Mm.

13:51.780 --> 13:52.680
Hello.

13:52.880 --> 13:54.750
Hey.

13:54.950 --> 13:57.650
Reliving the magic
of our wedding?
Mm-hmm.

13:57.850 --> 13:59.580
Look how much fun
everyone is having.

13:59.780 --> 14:01.890
And there's Kemi right in the
middle, life of the party.

14:02.090 --> 14:05.520
Mm. She looks so happy riding
on that man's shoulders.

14:05.720 --> 14:09.260
How can this be the same woman
who ran out of that restaurant?

14:09.460 --> 14:10.560
She's just having
a little self-doubt.

14:10.760 --> 14:12.260
Kemi may have a hard,
prickly exterior,

14:12.460 --> 14:14.530
but inside somewhere,
she's soft and sweet.

14:14.730 --> 14:16.430
She is a Nigerian,
not a pineapple.

14:16.630 --> 14:18.400
She's prickly inside and out.

14:18.600 --> 14:20.670
Maybe it comes from hanging
around too many Americans.

14:20.870 --> 14:23.540
I'm around you all the time,
I have not changed.

14:23.740 --> 14:26.510
Yesterday you bent over
to pet the neighbor's dog.

14:26.710 --> 14:29.110
Because he has the eyes
of a human.

14:29.310 --> 14:31.250
Listen, I'm sorry
I got involved.

14:31.450 --> 14:33.520
You were right,
it's none of our business.

14:33.720 --> 14:35.850
We have to find a way to make
Kemi marry Chukwuemeka.

14:36.050 --> 14:38.490
You're right again,
it is our business.

14:38.690 --> 14:40.390
Look, I don't know
if this is gonna happen.

14:40.590 --> 14:42.390
He's already looking
for jobs out of state.

14:42.590 --> 14:44.060
He doesn't care
what pharmacy it is.

14:44.260 --> 14:45.460
He would leave CVS?

14:45.660 --> 14:47.400
I heard he applied
at a Walgreens.

14:47.600 --> 14:48.300
No.

14:48.500 --> 14:50.920
He's a man on the edge.

14:51.890 --> 14:53.890
(knocking at door)

15:00.160 --> 15:01.150
Hello, Kofo.

15:01.350 --> 15:02.510
Goodwin.

15:02.710 --> 15:04.620
I see you have erased every sign
of my existence.

15:04.820 --> 15:08.120
How quickly a futon
becomes a pool table.

15:08.320 --> 15:10.420
Are you here to beg
to come back?

15:10.620 --> 15:12.020
No.

15:12.220 --> 15:14.990
In fact, I am about to sign
the lease on a new apartment.

15:15.190 --> 15:17.000
I just came to pick up my mail.

15:17.200 --> 15:19.610
I see.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.800
Thank you.
No trouble at all.

15:38.300 --> 15:40.320
If any more mail comes,

15:40.520 --> 15:43.740
I will be honored
to hold on to it for you.

15:44.940 --> 15:46.190
You're a good cousin.

15:46.390 --> 15:48.130
But I set up forwarding
with the post office,

15:48.330 --> 15:49.360
so you will not be bothered.

15:49.560 --> 15:51.010
Well, mistakes happen.

15:51.880 --> 15:55.630
And if they do,
I will always be there.

15:55.830 --> 15:57.720
I know you will.

15:59.090 --> 16:00.070
Goodbye, Kofo.

16:00.270 --> 16:02.320
Goodbye.

16:05.990 --> 16:07.150
Goodwin.

16:07.350 --> 16:08.580
Hmm?

16:08.780 --> 16:10.650
Do you think we will ever
see each other again?

16:10.850 --> 16:12.180
Yes, at work.

16:12.380 --> 16:15.370
Oh, right. Silly me.

16:23.510 --> 16:25.000
Morning, morning.

16:25.200 --> 16:26.660
Good morning.

16:26.860 --> 16:29.000
Why are you smiling like that?

16:29.200 --> 16:31.970
You need to sit right here.

16:32.170 --> 16:33.170
Why?

16:33.370 --> 16:34.910
What are you
going to do to me?

16:35.110 --> 16:36.170
All you need to know is
you are about to become

16:36.370 --> 16:37.640
the center of attention.

16:37.840 --> 16:39.560
Oh, okay.

16:42.060 --> 16:43.480
This is for you, Kemi!

16:43.680 --> 16:47.250
("Best of My Love" playing)

16:47.450 --> 16:48.750
Ooh.
Hey!

16:48.950 --> 16:51.960
Okay, I don't know what's
happening, but I like it.

16:52.160 --> 16:53.790
Ooh, shake it, Gloria.

16:53.990 --> 16:55.830
(laughing)
Shake it!

16:56.030 --> 16:56.830
Come on, y'all.

16:57.030 --> 16:58.930
Oh!

16:59.130 --> 17:02.170
An embarrassing flash mob,
for me?

17:02.370 --> 17:04.640
Oh, I love it, I love it!

17:04.840 --> 17:05.900
(laughter)

17:06.100 --> 17:08.740
* Never will I feel
discouraged *

17:08.940 --> 17:11.340
* 'Cause your love's
no mystery *

17:11.540 --> 17:13.580
Hips. Ooh, hips.

17:13.780 --> 17:16.410
* Demonstrating love
and affection *

17:16.610 --> 17:17.920
Okay. The choreography
is a little basic,

17:18.120 --> 17:20.750
but I am having fun,
I'm having fun.

17:20.950 --> 17:25.320
* I like the way you make me
feel you about you, baby... *

17:25.520 --> 17:27.490
KEMI:
That's it, hey!

17:27.690 --> 17:29.090
More hips, more hips.

17:29.290 --> 17:31.760
* Oh-oh, you've got
the best of my love... *

17:31.960 --> 17:35.830
The doctor prescribed
100 cc's of handsome.

17:36.030 --> 17:37.440
Hello, my love.

17:37.640 --> 17:38.870
Oh, Chukwuemeka.

17:39.070 --> 17:41.140
This is too much,
everyone is looking.

17:41.340 --> 17:42.820
It's so embarrassing.

17:45.790 --> 17:46.990
Kemi...

17:48.400 --> 17:50.620
Our friends pointed out
that I would be miserable

17:50.820 --> 17:52.880
working at a Walgreens
in Des Moines.

17:53.080 --> 17:55.350
The only thing that would
make me more miserable

17:55.550 --> 17:58.540
is to live a single day
without you.

17:59.510 --> 18:01.010
I refuse to give up on our love.

18:02.510 --> 18:08.680
Oh, well, my hand is feeling
suddenly very... naked.

18:09.650 --> 18:11.070
I can help with that.

18:11.270 --> 18:12.450
Kemi...

18:13.460 --> 18:15.340
will you marry me?

18:15.540 --> 18:17.760
Oh, Chukwuemeka.

18:19.290 --> 18:21.110
I have stipulations.

18:21.310 --> 18:22.980
Of course you do, my love.

18:23.180 --> 18:26.320
I will not be the traditional
Nigerian wife.

18:26.520 --> 18:28.420
I refuse to wait
on you hand and foot.

18:28.620 --> 18:30.970
I would not want it
any other way.

18:32.670 --> 18:34.690
And I will be me.

18:34.890 --> 18:35.990
The vivacious free bird

18:36.190 --> 18:39.080
with big dreams
and an ass to match.

18:40.180 --> 18:41.270
You do you.

18:41.470 --> 18:43.170
I will not even use
the word "wife."

18:43.370 --> 18:45.820
Well, then you may bejewel me.

18:46.620 --> 18:47.870
Is that a yes?

18:48.070 --> 18:49.070
Yes.

18:49.270 --> 18:50.910
She said yes!

18:51.110 --> 18:52.710
(cheering)

18:52.910 --> 18:55.800
I am going to have a husband!

18:56.530 --> 18:58.820
And I am going to have a Kemi.

18:59.020 --> 19:00.720
* It's growing every day *

19:00.920 --> 19:03.160
* <i>My love, my love</i> *

19:03.360 --> 19:05.520
* Oh-oh *

19:05.720 --> 19:08.940
* Doo-doo, doo-doo,
doo-doo, doo-doo, ow! *

19:15.950 --> 19:16.900
Is this everything?

19:17.100 --> 19:19.440
(panting) Yes. Oh.

19:19.640 --> 19:22.110
I have never had a whole
apartment to furnish.

19:22.310 --> 19:24.240
I think a trip
to IKEA is in my future.

19:24.440 --> 19:26.340
You are going to love
living alone.

19:26.540 --> 19:28.680
I-I had my own place
at university

19:28.880 --> 19:30.250
and it was wonderful.

19:30.450 --> 19:33.820
Every morning, I made fried eggs
and blasted Chaka Khan.

19:34.020 --> 19:34.890
(laughter)

19:35.090 --> 19:37.410
I am more Sade and bellinis.

19:38.170 --> 19:39.290
Oh, and don't worry,

19:39.490 --> 19:42.090
the dark thoughts
are few and far between.

19:42.290 --> 19:43.730
I am sorry, what?

19:43.930 --> 19:46.260
Well, there will be times
when you have a bad day,

19:46.460 --> 19:48.130
you'll go home
to your four walls,

19:48.330 --> 19:52.040
longing for any other
living person to talk to.

19:52.240 --> 19:53.970
Oh.
And it will cross your mind

19:54.170 --> 19:56.340
that if you have
a medical emergency,

19:56.540 --> 19:58.240
no one will find you
until the stench

19:58.440 --> 20:01.510
of your decomposing body
alerts the neighbors.

20:01.710 --> 20:02.610
Oh...

20:02.810 --> 20:04.680
But like I said...
(chuckles)

20:04.880 --> 20:06.530
few and far between!

20:08.100 --> 20:10.620
Enjoy your new apartment.

20:10.820 --> 20:12.510
I will.
