02:45.440 --> 02:47.431
Come on.

02:48.920 --> 02:50.558
Come on.

02:51.040 --> 02:52.712
Come....

02:52.920 --> 02:55.639
Come on. Come on, baby.

02:56.280 --> 03:01.070
Please, please. Come on, come on.
Come on!

03:26.840 --> 03:30.355
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

03:58.560 --> 03:59.913
Yeah.

04:01.960 --> 04:05.873
Slow down. Slow-- Slow down.

04:06.080 --> 04:08.992
And just-- Just take a deep breath.

04:09.400 --> 04:10.753
Do it.

04:11.520 --> 04:12.919
All right.

04:13.880 --> 04:15.552
Now, what happened?

04:27.840 --> 04:31.469
All right. All right. Now...

04:32.480 --> 04:36.598
...Iisten-- Listen to me.
Are you listening?

04:37.400 --> 04:40.153
Everything is gonna be okay.
I promise.

04:40.360 --> 04:42.316
No, no-- Listen. Calm down.

04:42.520 --> 04:43.953
Just....

04:44.800 --> 04:48.190
Sit tight. I know who to call.

05:14.440 --> 05:15.555
Saul Goodman sent me.

05:24.840 --> 05:27.434
Come on. Inside.

05:34.560 --> 05:36.278
Watch the door.

05:39.240 --> 05:40.912
Where is she?

07:06.720 --> 07:09.075
Any other drugs in the house?

07:14.400 --> 07:17.676
Think hard.
Your freedom depends on it.

07:19.640 --> 07:21.551
What about guns?
You got any guns in the house?

07:24.040 --> 07:25.473
Here's your story.

07:25.680 --> 07:29.070
You woke up. You found her.
That's all you know.

07:29.600 --> 07:31.079
Say it.

07:32.320 --> 07:36.438
Say it, please. "l woke up. I found her.
That's all I know."

07:39.680 --> 07:42.194
Say it. "l woke up. I found her.
That's all I know."

07:42.400 --> 07:44.197
I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know.

07:44.720 --> 07:45.675
Again.

07:46.520 --> 07:48.397
I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know.

07:48.600 --> 07:50.113
Again. Again.

07:50.320 --> 07:53.153
I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know.

07:53.360 --> 07:56.591
I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know.

08:01.880 --> 08:03.598
Once you call,
the people who show up...

08:03.800 --> 08:06.268
...will be with
the Office of Medical lnvestigations.

08:06.480 --> 08:08.755
That's primarily who you'll talk to.

08:08.960 --> 08:11.155
Police officers may arrive,
they may not.

08:11.360 --> 08:13.351
Depends on how busy
a morning they're having.

08:13.560 --> 08:15.949
Typically, ODs are not
a high-priority call.

08:16.680 --> 08:18.318
There's nothing to incriminate you...

08:18.520 --> 08:20.750
...so I'd be amazed
if you got placed under arrest.

08:21.600 --> 08:26.151
However, if you do, you say nothing.

08:26.360 --> 08:28.396
You tell them
you just want your lawyer.

08:28.600 --> 08:30.716
Then you call Saul Goodman.

08:31.600 --> 08:34.193
And do I need to state the obvious?

08:35.840 --> 08:38.149
I was not here.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.513
You put on a long-sleeved shirt...

08:49.720 --> 08:51.551
...and cover
those track marks on your arm.

08:55.440 --> 08:58.591
Count down from 20,
and then you dial.

09:10.400 --> 09:13.756
Hang tough.
You're in the home stretch.

09:38.720 --> 09:41.314
Do you want 2-percent or skim?

09:41.520 --> 09:45.229
-Two.
-Two. All right.

09:47.960 --> 09:49.439
Thank you.

09:53.120 --> 09:54.678
Junior.

09:59.840 --> 10:01.592
Junior.

10:02.160 --> 10:04.469
-Flynn.
-What?

10:05.600 --> 10:06.999
Flynn.

10:09.240 --> 10:10.798
Flynn.

10:11.120 --> 10:13.395
I'll be there in a minute.

10:18.240 --> 10:19.958
You all right?

10:24.800 --> 10:27.997
Flynn, get your butt in here.

10:28.720 --> 10:31.871
Oh, my God. Mom, Dad, come here.
You gotta see this.

10:32.080 --> 10:33.991
Seriously.

10:36.720 --> 10:41.077
-What?
-Look right there. Look at that.

10:43.600 --> 10:44.555
Are those donations?

10:44.760 --> 10:46.352
-Yes.
-Actual donations for your dad?

10:49.280 --> 10:53.831
Total strangers gave us $490.

10:54.040 --> 10:58.670
Twenty-six people.
Virginia, Minnesota, Montana.

10:58.880 --> 11:02.190
Look at this one. Vancouver.
All the way up in Canada.

11:02.720 --> 11:05.632
And it's all real, actual money.

11:06.120 --> 11:09.795
It's actually right there
in the PayPal account.

11:11.040 --> 11:13.713
And look what they're saying.

11:13.920 --> 11:18.038
"Hang in there, Walt." "Good luck."
"Hang in there."

11:19.000 --> 11:21.036
Isn't this awesome?

11:23.040 --> 11:27.272
That's-- Wow, that is something.

11:29.120 --> 11:31.759
Walt, don't you think
a little thank-you is in order?

11:32.680 --> 11:35.877
Yes, absolutely. Thank you, son.

11:36.080 --> 11:39.152
Thank you. This is a big, big help.

11:40.440 --> 11:45.434
Oh, look, 20 more bucks
from Thunder Bay, Ontario.

11:45.640 --> 11:50.430
Damn. Five hundred and ten dollars.

11:58.560 --> 12:01.597
Ifyou're trying to sell me something,
I've got four words for you:

12:01.800 --> 12:02.755
"Do-not-call list. "

12:02.960 --> 12:05.633
However, if you're cool,
leave it at the beep.

12:05.840 --> 12:08.354
How did I know you wouldn't be
answering your phone?

12:08.560 --> 12:10.516
I'm on my way.
I'm gonna be there momentarily.

12:10.720 --> 12:16.078
I expect you on the porch, bag packed,
ready to go. No excuses.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.470
Sir, you may not wanna
be here for this.

13:18.560 --> 13:24.396
I just woke up and I found her.

13:24.600 --> 13:26.352
That's all I know.

13:26.880 --> 13:28.757
What's her date of birth?

13:34.720 --> 13:38.190
Sir, your daughter's date of birth?

13:39.120 --> 13:40.519
April....

13:40.720 --> 13:44.429
-April 4th, 1982.
-Okay.

13:44.880 --> 13:49.112
And mother's maiden name
and place of birth.

13:49.880 --> 13:52.519
-My mother?
-Your daughter's mother.

13:53.880 --> 13:55.233
Bishop.

13:56.920 --> 14:00.037
-And place of birth?
-Phoenix.

14:01.600 --> 14:02.874
Phoenix, Arizona?

14:07.520 --> 14:08.555
This is our address.

14:09.280 --> 14:10.918
Do you have someone
who can drive you?

14:11.120 --> 14:12.473
I can drive.

14:12.680 --> 14:14.557
Well, then if you'd like
to meet us there...

14:14.760 --> 14:17.069
...we can complete the intake
and take our samples...

14:17.280 --> 14:19.475
...and then you can make
your arrangements.

14:19.680 --> 14:20.954
Okay?

14:21.160 --> 14:24.550
Now, do you need a card?
Will you both be coming?

14:47.680 --> 14:50.990
I don't believe it.
Walt, you have to see this.

14:51.200 --> 14:53.111
-Forty from Te--
-Terre Haute.

14:53.320 --> 14:54.275
Walt.

15:04.360 --> 15:05.315
It's me.

15:05.520 --> 15:07.556
Are you there? Hello.

15:08.640 --> 15:11.837
I'm just checking in.

15:12.400 --> 15:16.188
Our friend says
he thinks everything went well.

15:16.400 --> 15:18.630
That's-- That's good.

15:18.840 --> 15:22.833
So listen. Just call me, all right?

15:23.040 --> 15:27.795
Hey, Walt, you've gotta come in here.
We just broke a thousand dollars.

15:30.800 --> 15:33.473
All right. I'm coming.

15:34.840 --> 15:37.718
Some of you already know
my brother-in-law. He's a good man.

15:37.920 --> 15:40.753
The doctors say this operation
has a real chance of helping him.

15:40.960 --> 15:45.033
They're also saying they wanna
be paid in private islands, so dig deep.

15:45.880 --> 15:47.233
Biggest donation...

15:47.440 --> 15:50.159
...gets a six-pack
of my very own Schraderbrau.

15:50.960 --> 15:52.757
Home-brewed to silky perfection.

15:52.960 --> 15:54.712
Smallest donation
gets two six-packs.

15:54.920 --> 15:57.912
All right. Other than Gomie here
pees sitting down...

15:58.120 --> 15:59.109
...here's what we know.

15:59.320 --> 16:01.595
Christian Ortega, a.k.a. Combo.

16:01.800 --> 16:04.268
Shot dead
by an unknown assailant last month.

16:04.480 --> 16:06.038
"Combo?" I hear you say.

16:06.560 --> 16:10.030
"Why, I'm unfamiliar with that name.
Was he a Nobel laureate perchance?"

16:10.240 --> 16:12.754
No. He was a dipshit
wannabe banger.

16:12.960 --> 16:15.394
Now, no arrests,
save for stealing a baby Jesus...

16:15.600 --> 16:18.068
...from a Knights of Columbus manger
back when he was 17.

16:18.280 --> 16:22.068
This dude was so low-rep,
he never showed up on our radar.

16:22.400 --> 16:24.038
So why am I talking about him?

16:24.960 --> 16:27.520
Anyone? Anyone?

16:27.720 --> 16:28.675
Bueller?

16:29.120 --> 16:30.997
-He was dealing Blue Sky.
-That's right.

16:31.200 --> 16:33.873
Now, how is it that the purest,
most professional grade...

16:34.080 --> 16:38.517
...of meth we've ever come across
is being slung by the likes of that?

16:38.720 --> 16:40.119
But wait. It gets better.

16:40.320 --> 16:43.312
Since baby-Jesus thief there
slowed a bullet with his neck...

16:43.520 --> 16:45.476
...the blue stuff's
vanished from town, okay?

16:45.680 --> 16:48.478
Not a speck to be found
in Albuquerque. Now, why is that?

16:49.520 --> 16:53.832
Well, because maybe
your Heisenberg's in prison.

16:54.720 --> 16:56.995
So says A.P.D.
They think they got their man.

16:57.200 --> 16:59.509
I know you don't buy it,
but maybe it's true.

16:59.720 --> 17:05.192
James Edward Kilkelly, yeah.
A.P.D. thinks this is our mastermind.

17:05.400 --> 17:07.310
You believe that,
I got a bridge to sell you.

17:07.520 --> 17:10.034
-He copped to it, didn't he?
-For an extra pudding cup...

17:10.240 --> 17:11.513
...every night at Los Lunas?

17:11.720 --> 17:13.711
Maybe if you give him
a pack of cigarettes...

17:13.920 --> 17:17.037
...he'll tell you what
he did with Jimmy Hoffa. No, no, no.

17:17.240 --> 17:18.468
I've been thinking.

17:18.680 --> 17:22.992
Top-shelf product like this?
It doesn't fall off the face of the earth.

17:23.200 --> 17:25.031
Raw talent's bound
to pop up somewhere.

17:25.240 --> 17:27.800
It's like Whack-A-Mole.
So I've been making phone calls.

17:28.000 --> 17:31.231
Local police departments,
small-town sheriffs.

17:32.160 --> 17:34.469
Haven't had much luck
inside the Land of Enchantment.

17:34.680 --> 17:37.114
But outside,
I've got reports of the blue stuff...

17:37.320 --> 17:40.198
...making a scene here in Texas,
Arizona, Colorado and Nevada.

17:40.400 --> 17:44.359
In fact, everywhere but here.

17:44.880 --> 17:49.271
Almost as if somebody wised up,
stopped shitting where they eat.

17:50.400 --> 17:51.719
Now...

17:52.480 --> 17:54.994
...I say Heisenberg's still out there.

17:55.720 --> 17:58.029
I say he's gone regional.

17:58.240 --> 18:00.356
Only he's still right here in town.

18:01.440 --> 18:04.113
Come on, 2800.

18:04.320 --> 18:07.471
Come on, big 28. You can do it.

18:07.680 --> 18:10.194
Only 30 more dollars. Thirty more.

18:11.120 --> 18:13.873
Fo-- Forty dollars! Twenty-eight ten.

18:14.080 --> 18:15.479
-Yes!
-Yes!

18:19.120 --> 18:20.075
Who's gonna be next?

18:20.280 --> 18:21.998
Your guy found him?

18:22.480 --> 18:24.152
Where is he?

18:24.360 --> 18:25.315
Okay, listen.

18:25.520 --> 18:26.953
No, no, I don't care.

18:27.160 --> 18:28.718
You have your guy pick--

18:28.920 --> 18:30.831
Saul. Just shut-- Saul.

18:31.040 --> 18:34.191
Saul, shut up
and give me the address.

18:37.280 --> 18:38.793
I don't recommend it.

18:40.120 --> 18:41.997
A.P.D.'s been known
to sit on this place...

18:42.200 --> 18:44.760
..keep an eye
on the comings and goings.

18:45.440 --> 18:46.759
Are they here now?

18:46.960 --> 18:50.669
Well, I don't see any sign,
but that's the point.

18:51.800 --> 18:53.836
Police could be the least of it.

18:54.040 --> 18:55.917
You could just get mugged or shot.

18:58.200 --> 19:01.078
How about you go on home, Walter?

19:01.280 --> 19:03.191
Let me handle this.

19:31.720 --> 19:33.153
Yo.

20:29.960 --> 20:31.598
Jesse.

20:35.120 --> 20:37.429
Jesse. Jesse. Look at me, son.

20:37.640 --> 20:40.438
-Wake up. Wake up.
-Hey.

20:40.640 --> 20:44.155
I ain't got nothing for you, man.
It's all gone.

20:44.360 --> 20:46.271
Jesse, damn it, wake up. Just--

20:46.480 --> 20:49.597
Jesse, Jesse. Jesse, it's me.
Okay, it's me. It's Walt. It's Walt.

20:49.800 --> 20:50.869
Jesse.

20:51.080 --> 20:53.640
-Yeah.
-Come on, let's get out of here.

20:53.840 --> 20:57.310
No, no, no.

20:57.520 --> 20:59.431
-I'm good.
-Come on. Help me out now.

20:59.640 --> 21:02.837
I'm good. I'm good.
Right here, man. Right here.

21:03.040 --> 21:06.077
Listen, Jesse, you are not good
right here.

21:06.280 --> 21:08.350
You are not good at all. You hear?

21:08.880 --> 21:12.077
Now, you just put your arms
around me. Come on.

21:12.280 --> 21:13.599
You're gonna stand up...

21:13.800 --> 21:16.155
...and we're gonna
walk out of here, okay?

21:16.360 --> 21:18.316
We're gonna take you
someplace nice and safe.

21:18.520 --> 21:21.637
That's it. Now, let's go.
Come on. Here we go.

21:48.440 --> 21:50.351
I killed her.

21:50.560 --> 21:53.472
-What?
-I killed her. It was me.

21:53.680 --> 21:55.238
-I killed her, man. I killed her.
-No.

21:55.440 --> 21:58.432
Jesse, look at me. Look at me.

21:58.640 --> 21:59.993
You didn't kill anybody.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.515
I loved her.

22:05.840 --> 22:09.594
I loved her more than anything.

22:18.800 --> 22:23.157
No, no. No.

23:10.200 --> 23:12.191
I haven't given much thought
to the programs.

23:12.400 --> 23:14.516
I guess they should be....

23:15.640 --> 23:19.076
I don't know.
Just use your best judgement.

23:20.360 --> 23:22.555
There's no yellow dress here.

23:22.760 --> 23:26.230
It's all-- It's all black and grey.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.719
When's the last time you saw her
ever wearing a yellow dress?

23:32.440 --> 23:34.396
What about blue?

23:34.600 --> 23:37.751
Blue's better than black, right?

23:38.360 --> 23:41.432
No, no. Not dark blue. More like....

23:41.640 --> 23:45.474
Not super-bright, either.

23:45.680 --> 23:47.272
I mean, blue is blue.

23:47.480 --> 23:50.916
No. No cleavage.

23:52.240 --> 23:54.071
Long sleeves.

23:55.600 --> 23:58.353
Yeah. It's nice.

23:59.960 --> 24:01.473
It's nice.

24:06.920 --> 24:08.672
Big yawn, Holly.

24:08.880 --> 24:11.758
I know what you feel like.
I'm tired too.

24:13.960 --> 24:16.633
-Okay, sweetie.
-Yes.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.399
Yes!

24:22.000 --> 24:22.955
Here we go.

24:23.160 --> 24:26.630
Here we go. Yes.

24:32.440 --> 24:35.671
Would you mind
turning that thing down or off?

24:36.200 --> 24:38.430
Junior. Hey.

24:39.440 --> 24:42.193
The dinging.
Just turn down the volume.

24:42.400 --> 24:46.837
-Dad, it's money.
-Just please do it.

24:47.040 --> 24:49.429
Okay, the noise
is disturbing the baby.

24:52.120 --> 24:54.031
Marie, slow down. I can't--

24:56.120 --> 24:58.998
Oh, my God. You are kidding me.

24:59.480 --> 25:02.552
Sure. Of course.
Any day after school.

25:02.760 --> 25:06.389
Okay. Wait. I'm gonna-- Let me tell him,
and I'll call you right back.

25:06.600 --> 25:07.919
Okay.

25:09.560 --> 25:11.118
-Guess what.
-What?

25:11.320 --> 25:13.709
-You are gonna be in the newspaper.
-No way.

25:13.920 --> 25:15.831
One of Marie's patients
works at the Journal.

25:16.040 --> 25:18.235
She told him about the website
and the donations...

25:18.440 --> 25:20.670
...and they're gonna do a story
about you.

25:20.880 --> 25:21.835
-For real?
-Yep.

25:22.040 --> 25:24.918
They're coming to interview you
with a photo and everything.

25:25.120 --> 25:26.633
Awesome.

25:26.840 --> 25:31.231
-lt'll mean more hits.
-And more contributions.

25:35.840 --> 25:37.671
East of Scottsdale?

25:37.880 --> 25:40.189
Let me guess. Not talking.

25:41.040 --> 25:42.758
Nope. Not a one.

25:42.960 --> 25:45.758
Someone somewhere
is running one tight ship.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.309
All right, chief. Yeah. Thanks a lot.

25:50.520 --> 25:52.192
Yeah. You too.

25:55.920 --> 25:57.638
Agent Schrader,
can you spare a moment?

25:57.840 --> 25:59.910
Yes, sir. Absolutely.

26:02.760 --> 26:05.513
Gentlemen, this is
Supervising Agent Hank Schrader.

26:06.000 --> 26:09.629
Agent Schrader, I'd like you to meet
Andrew Coffman of the Adobe Hotel.

26:09.840 --> 26:11.512
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

26:11.720 --> 26:13.711
Paul Canterna
of Canterna Real Estate.

26:13.920 --> 26:15.672
-Hey, it's a pleasure.
-Good to meet you.

26:15.880 --> 26:19.236
And Gustavo Fring
of Los Pollos Hermanos.

26:19.440 --> 26:21.431
-Please, just Gus.
-Hi, Gus.

26:21.640 --> 26:23.358
You guys make some killer chicken.

26:24.120 --> 26:25.075
Thank you very much.

26:25.280 --> 26:27.669
These gentlemen are underwriting
this year's Fun Run...

26:27.880 --> 26:29.632
...and I thought
I would give them a tour.

26:29.840 --> 26:32.308
Absolutely. Get to see
what you're supporting. Thank you.

26:32.520 --> 26:34.511
Can you tell us a little
about your work here?

26:34.720 --> 26:36.153
Yes, the Albuquerque office...

26:36.360 --> 26:38.874
...covers everything
from drug-related money laundering...

26:39.080 --> 26:41.719
...to interdiction of illicit substances
crossing the border.

26:42.280 --> 26:45.556
Now, the group that I supervise
focuses on methamphetamine...

26:45.760 --> 26:48.638
...which is a growing problem
in the country, unfortunately.

26:48.840 --> 26:51.070
-Terrible.
-Yeah. It is indeed.

26:51.280 --> 26:52.793
We've had
some successes locally...

26:53.000 --> 26:54.991
...but overall,
the supply seems to be growing.

26:55.200 --> 26:58.636
I gotta tell you, community outreach,
like this Fun Run...

26:58.840 --> 27:00.910
...one of the most powerful
weapons we have.

27:01.120 --> 27:02.269
Anything we can do.

27:02.480 --> 27:03.833
-Thank you.
-Thank you, Hank.

27:04.040 --> 27:05.109
-Gentlemen.
-Thanks.

27:05.320 --> 27:06.912
Sure. Thank you.

27:07.760 --> 27:09.478
Is this one of your agents?

27:09.680 --> 27:13.468
Oh, yeah, no, no,
that's my brother-in-law.

27:13.680 --> 27:15.557
He's got a health issue.
We're trying to--

27:15.760 --> 27:19.036
Oh, I'm very sorry.
What sort of health issue?

27:20.040 --> 27:23.669
-Lung cancer.
-Oh, that's a rough one.

27:24.480 --> 27:29.395
-Oh, hey, you don't have to do that.
-Please. Please. I'm happy to do it.

27:31.400 --> 27:33.038
-Thank you very much.
-You're welcome.

27:51.080 --> 27:54.436
Just so you know,
I won't be back for a while.

27:55.240 --> 27:58.073
I'm gonna have
my surgery on Friday.

28:00.560 --> 28:02.869
I'm hopeful it'll go well.

28:04.840 --> 28:07.673
But if not,
Saul will take care of things.

28:07.880 --> 28:10.952
He's got your money.
He's keeping it for you.

28:22.120 --> 28:25.954
Look, Jesse, lingering on things
doesn't help, believe me.

28:26.160 --> 28:30.199
Just try and focus
on getting better, okay.

28:31.160 --> 28:33.116
I deserve this.

28:34.080 --> 28:35.479
What?

28:37.320 --> 28:40.153
What you said in the desert.

28:40.360 --> 28:43.909
I get it, what you meant.

28:47.960 --> 28:50.235
I deserve whatever happens.

29:09.800 --> 29:11.711
Oh, shit.

29:26.600 --> 29:28.192
There he is!

29:28.920 --> 29:31.912
Walt, they're doing a feature
on Walter Jr.

29:32.120 --> 29:34.395
We called you about 50 times.

29:34.600 --> 29:37.831
Marie, I thought we were just talking
about a newspaper story.

29:38.040 --> 29:41.316
I know. But I thought, you know,
if it's good enough for the Journal...

29:41.520 --> 29:44.910
...then why not TV? So I went for it.

29:46.240 --> 29:47.468
-This is him?
-Yes.

29:47.680 --> 29:48.999
This is Dad. Great.

29:49.200 --> 29:52.317
Let's get everyone on the couch.
I'm thinking Walt Jr. in the middle...

29:52.520 --> 29:54.351
...Mom and Dad on either side.

29:54.560 --> 29:55.913
Mom and Dad?

29:57.880 --> 30:00.553
How much money
have you raised so far?

30:01.080 --> 30:04.629
Six thousand, three hundred
and sixty dollars.

30:04.840 --> 30:06.796
But there's more coming in
all the time.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.719
-Wow, that's amazing.
-We don't even know what to say.

30:09.920 --> 30:13.230
It's just-- It's been incredible.

30:13.440 --> 30:15.556
Judging from things you have
written about him...

30:15.760 --> 30:21.232
-...your dad must be quite a guy.
-Yeah. He is. He's the best.

30:21.440 --> 30:23.795
You don't wanna lose him,
do you, Walter?

30:24.000 --> 30:27.993
None of us do. We love him.

30:28.600 --> 30:32.752
-He's a good man, isn't he?
-Absolutely. Ask anyone.

30:33.680 --> 30:36.672
Anybody. He's a great father,
a great teacher.

30:36.880 --> 30:39.348
He knows everything there is
to know about chemistry.

30:39.920 --> 30:43.674
He's patient with you,
and he's always there for you.

30:43.880 --> 30:48.158
He's just decent.

30:48.360 --> 30:51.670
And he always does the right thing.

30:51.880 --> 30:55.190
And that's how he teaches me to be.

30:55.400 --> 30:59.996
-Would you say he's your hero?
-Oh, yeah. Yes, ma'am. Totally.

31:00.200 --> 31:02.714
My dad is my hero.

31:10.800 --> 31:12.358
Does that put him to sleep?

31:13.240 --> 31:14.912
This one just relaxes him a little.

31:15.120 --> 31:17.759
We're almost ready.
We'll be taking you in, in just a minute.

31:17.960 --> 31:19.518
Okay. Thank you.

31:23.280 --> 31:24.474
Well....

31:26.200 --> 31:29.397
-Here we are.
-Yeah.

31:47.800 --> 31:50.598
Relaxed yet?

31:50.800 --> 31:52.836
As a matter of fact....

31:56.600 --> 32:01.230
I don't know what this stuff is,
but it's pretty great.

32:03.160 --> 32:04.559
Yeah, it looks like it.

32:07.280 --> 32:09.271
We'll be here when you wake up.

32:10.200 --> 32:12.760
Well, I'll be looking for you.

32:12.960 --> 32:15.520
They'll probably want me
to take your glasses.

32:15.720 --> 32:17.358
Yeah, you better.

32:18.000 --> 32:21.709
Yeah, okay. Okay. I got them.

32:23.240 --> 32:25.117
Where's your phone?

32:25.320 --> 32:27.436
Your cell phone. Did you bring it?

32:27.640 --> 32:29.278
Which one?

32:32.640 --> 32:37.634
I'm pretty sure
he didn't bring it, Mom.

32:40.120 --> 32:41.439
Okay.

33:55.520 --> 33:56.919
Well, first things first.

33:57.120 --> 33:59.350
How old is that baby now?
When do I get to meet her?

33:59.560 --> 34:02.393
I was actually thinking
of bringing her today, but....

34:02.600 --> 34:04.716
She's 7 weeks tomorrow.

34:04.920 --> 34:05.875
-Seven, right?
-Yeah.

34:06.080 --> 34:10.391
Yeah, oh, hey, I have a picture...

34:10.600 --> 34:12.351
...here somewhere.

34:13.840 --> 34:16.034
-She's beautiful.
-Thanks.

34:16.239 --> 34:18.833
Always a relief to say that
and actually mean it.

34:20.199 --> 34:23.636
-How's your pain level, Walter?
-It's....

34:23.840 --> 34:25.751
Very low, basically.

34:25.960 --> 34:27.757
Shortness of breath?

34:27.960 --> 34:30.599
-A bit, but much better.
-Good.

34:31.719 --> 34:33.391
Well, your margins look good.

34:33.600 --> 34:35.033
I can't foresee the future...

34:35.239 --> 34:36.958
...but even
conservatively speaking...

34:37.159 --> 34:39.674
...I can say that you bought yourself
some real time here.

34:40.800 --> 34:43.109
There's no reason
not to be optimistic.

34:43.320 --> 34:45.038
That's great.

34:45.480 --> 34:48.677
That is great. Thank you, doctor.

34:50.000 --> 34:53.275
So when could he get back
to his normal routine?

34:53.480 --> 34:55.710
-He can ease into it now.
-Okay.

34:55.920 --> 35:01.119
-And can he go back to work or...?
-I'd give it a few more weeks.

35:01.640 --> 35:05.315
Make sure you avoid any heavy lifting
and continue to get plenty of rest.

35:05.520 --> 35:07.988
But he can be on his own?

35:08.200 --> 35:11.317
I mean, just more,
you know, independent.

35:11.760 --> 35:14.194
Yes. Use your best judgement.

35:15.000 --> 35:16.228
Well....

35:16.440 --> 35:18.908
Now, that's good news
for you, huh, honey?

35:19.120 --> 35:21.315
One less baby in the house.

35:32.240 --> 35:34.310
-Don, hey.
-Hey, Stew.

35:34.520 --> 35:36.875
Hey, welcome back.

35:37.080 --> 35:38.957
Thanks. It's good to be back.

35:41.000 --> 35:45.278
Jesus. We were all so sorry to hear.

35:46.040 --> 35:48.110
Yes. Thanks.

35:48.440 --> 35:50.431
Terrible thing. Just....

35:51.160 --> 35:54.197
But, you know, we've all been
thinking about you, and....

35:54.400 --> 35:56.960
-You been doing okay?
-I'm doing okay.

35:57.360 --> 36:00.716
After a certain point,
time off doesn't help...

36:00.920 --> 36:04.310
...so I figured I'd rather be here.

36:04.840 --> 36:08.628
-Focus on work.
-Sure. Absolutely.

36:09.240 --> 36:10.514
Yeah.

36:11.080 --> 36:13.389
Well, see you inside.

36:14.880 --> 36:18.190
Continue to descend through 1500.

36:18.400 --> 36:21.278
Headed downwind for a left base
on Runway 17.

36:21.480 --> 36:25.075
Number 26-Tango,
descend to maintain 13,000.

36:25.280 --> 36:28.875
Truth or Consequences altimeter,
two-niner-niner-eight.

36:29.080 --> 36:33.756
Pima 311, contact
Albuquerque Center 134.6.

36:33.960 --> 36:37.316
Juliet-5-Bravo, ident, say altitude.

36:37.960 --> 36:41.953
Juliet-5-Bravo, roger.
Clear direct to Winslow.

36:42.160 --> 36:44.628
I think I may just keep this.

36:44.880 --> 36:45.869
Sky?

36:47.480 --> 36:48.913
What do you think?

36:50.680 --> 36:52.636
Doesn't look so bad, right?

36:54.840 --> 36:55.989
What are you doing?

36:56.200 --> 36:58.634
I'm going to Hank and Marie's
for the weekend.

37:00.760 --> 37:02.557
-Since when?
-I'm taking the baby with me.

37:02.760 --> 37:04.591
Marie will pick up
Walter Jr. from school.

37:05.320 --> 37:08.073
You'll have the house to yourself
for two days.

37:08.680 --> 37:11.114
I want you to pack your things
and leave.

37:12.040 --> 37:13.234
Why would I do that?

37:13.440 --> 37:16.477
Hank has offered to help. You shouldn't
be doing any heavy lifting.

37:16.680 --> 37:19.035
-Skyler.
-I want you gone by Monday morning.

37:19.240 --> 37:20.593
I want--

37:21.000 --> 37:22.149
I want you gone.

37:31.560 --> 37:35.314
Okay. Can you at least tell me why?

37:36.280 --> 37:38.510
Because you're a liar, Walt.

37:40.600 --> 37:42.192
Two cell phones, after all.

37:43.600 --> 37:44.555
What?

37:44.760 --> 37:47.593
Before your surgery, I asked
if you had packed your cell phone...

37:47.800 --> 37:51.509
...and you said, "Which one?"

37:52.720 --> 37:53.869
When?

37:54.080 --> 37:56.514
Skyler, I was medicated.

37:56.720 --> 37:58.790
I mean, I could have said
the world was flat.

37:59.000 --> 37:59.955
You know what I think?

38:01.800 --> 38:04.837
I think you accidentally
told the truth.

38:05.200 --> 38:07.794
Honey, we have been over this.

38:08.000 --> 38:09.877
Asked and answered, right?

38:10.080 --> 38:12.878
Then it got me thinking again...

38:13.080 --> 38:16.516
...about all the strange behaviour.

38:16.720 --> 38:19.075
Not the least of which
was the disappearance.

38:19.280 --> 38:21.635
Out of my mind with worry,
calling hospitals...

38:21.840 --> 38:23.671
...checking the morgue.

38:24.480 --> 38:26.550
Your fugue state?

38:29.040 --> 38:31.508
I had to believe that, didn't l?

38:32.000 --> 38:34.355
I had to find a way.

38:35.280 --> 38:39.990
I mean, who would lie
about such a thing?

38:40.680 --> 38:41.908
You tell me, Skyler.

38:42.120 --> 38:45.078
You tell me exactly what it is
you think I'm lying about.

38:45.560 --> 38:48.313
What? I'm having an affair.
Is that what you think?

38:48.520 --> 38:50.636
Yeah. For the last few weeks.

38:50.840 --> 38:53.400
With whom?
Who am I having an affair with?

38:53.600 --> 38:55.875
Well, my guess
was Gretchen Schwartz.

38:56.640 --> 39:00.235
Something was going on between you.
I just knew.

39:00.440 --> 39:03.830
Jesus. Skyler. Get me a Bible
to swear on, if that's what it takes.

39:04.040 --> 39:05.758
I am not having an affair
with Gretchen.

39:05.960 --> 39:08.872
I know. I know you're not.
Because I asked her.

39:12.520 --> 39:14.715
It really took me forever
to get in touch with her.

39:14.920 --> 39:16.751
She was ducking my calls for weeks.

39:17.680 --> 39:19.033
So I finally left a message:

39:19.240 --> 39:22.915
"What exactly is going on
between you and my husband?"

39:23.120 --> 39:25.429
I thought that'd get her attention,
and it did.

39:25.640 --> 39:29.076
So she called me back,
and she finally told me.

39:30.520 --> 39:32.795
The money for your treatment...

39:34.040 --> 39:37.794
...Gretchen and Elliott
didn't give you a dime.

39:39.400 --> 39:41.072
They paid for nothing.

39:41.280 --> 39:43.589
You refused every offer
they made you.

39:43.800 --> 39:45.028
But that didn't make sense...

39:45.240 --> 39:47.595
...because I checked with Delcavoli
and the hospital...

39:47.800 --> 39:50.951
...and not including your surgery...

39:51.160 --> 39:53.071
...we're nearly paid up.

39:53.400 --> 39:55.994
Over $100,000.

39:57.400 --> 40:01.598
Out of where? Out of thin air?

40:09.720 --> 40:11.392
But then...

40:12.800 --> 40:14.916
...I called your mother.

40:16.920 --> 40:18.399
Yeah.

40:19.400 --> 40:21.152
Thanks for that too.

40:21.800 --> 40:24.030
But I thought, you know,
maybe she has some money...

40:24.240 --> 40:28.153
...that I don't know about.
Maybe she contributed.

40:29.480 --> 40:31.277
It's possible.

40:33.360 --> 40:37.638
It turns out that not only is the money
not from your mother...

40:37.840 --> 40:42.675
...she didn't even know
that you have cancer.

40:45.800 --> 40:47.995
You never went to see her.

40:49.600 --> 40:51.591
I dropped you at the airport.
I picked you up.

40:51.800 --> 40:53.153
You were gone for four days...

40:53.360 --> 40:56.989
...and yet she swears...

40:57.520 --> 40:59.715
...that you were never there.

41:04.280 --> 41:08.432
Lies on top of lies on top of lies.

41:10.280 --> 41:11.235
Skyler.

41:12.280 --> 41:13.998
Could you...

41:14.920 --> 41:16.797
...just once...

41:19.560 --> 41:23.109
...do me the courtesy
of not denying it?

41:31.920 --> 41:33.433
Skyler.

41:35.040 --> 41:36.632
Skyler, don't do this, please.

41:36.840 --> 41:38.990
I....

41:39.560 --> 41:41.994
Skyler, please don't go.

41:50.480 --> 41:54.996
If I tell you the truth, will you stay?

41:57.000 --> 41:59.719
Stay, and I will tell you everything.

42:01.000 --> 42:02.752
Whatever it is...

42:03.840 --> 42:05.717
...I'm afraid to know.

42:32.840 --> 42:34.956
Wayfarer-515, radio check.

42:36.000 --> 42:37.956
