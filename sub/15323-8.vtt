WEBVTT

00:00.178 --> 00:03.183
YOU'RE ON PROBATION,
STAFFORD.
<i>PREVIOUSLY ON "BETRAYAL"...</i>

00:03.183 --> 00:05.837
BRANDY IS NO GOOD FOR YOU.
I'M GONNA MARRY HER.

00:05.837 --> 00:07.004
THE BEST THING WOULD BE
FOR THAT GIRL

00:07.004 --> 00:09.507
TO DISAPPEAR
FROM BOTH OUR LIVES!

00:09.507 --> 00:12.844
BRANDY, ARE YOU HOME?

00:12.844 --> 00:15.479
YOU LYING COWARD!
YOU...

00:16.514 --> 00:18.115
I'VE MET SOMEONE.

00:18.115 --> 00:19.217
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

00:19.217 --> 00:20.952
IT MEANS
HE'S CHEATING ON MOM.

00:20.952 --> 00:22.653
GET OUT!
MOMMY?

00:22.653 --> 00:23.955
DON'T LET HIM
SEE THIS, OKAY?

00:23.955 --> 00:25.823
MOMMY?
OLIVER.

00:25.823 --> 00:29.894
LET'S NOT BE ALONE
TONIGHT.

00:42.240 --> 00:44.242
HEY.
HEY.

00:44.242 --> 00:45.243
IT'S 4:00 A.M.

00:45.243 --> 00:47.378
I KNOW.
I'VE BEEN UP SINCE 2:00.

00:47.378 --> 00:49.614
I WAS AFRAID
I'D OVERSLEEP.

00:49.614 --> 00:52.016
OLIVER WON'T BE AWAKE
FOR HOURS.
I KNOW.

00:52.016 --> 00:54.151
COME BACK TO BED.
MM.

00:54.151 --> 00:56.754
WHAT WE'VE DONE HERE
IS NOT A SMALL THING.

00:56.754 --> 00:58.522
NO.

00:58.522 --> 01:01.025
OLIVER, VIC, VAL.

01:02.627 --> 01:05.897
IT'S GONNA CHANGE THEIR LIVES
FOREVER.

01:05.897 --> 01:08.733
IT'S GONNA BECOME
PART OF WHO THEY ARE.

01:08.733 --> 01:12.436
I KNOW IT MIGHT SEEM IMPOSSIBLE,
BUT...

01:12.436 --> 01:15.406
I REALLY THINK THAT ONE DAY
THEY'LL UNDERSTAND.

01:15.406 --> 01:18.609
THEY WON'T.

01:31.389 --> 01:34.091
MAYBE THEY'LL GROW UP
BELIEVING THAT...

01:34.091 --> 01:39.897
HAPPINESS IS WORTH FIGHTING FOR,
WORTH CHANGING FOR.

01:42.566 --> 01:45.703
I LIKE THAT.
SAY IT AGAIN.

01:45.703 --> 01:47.838
REALLY?

01:47.838 --> 01:49.407
NO.

01:49.407 --> 01:53.110
JUST TELL ME WE'RE NOT RUINING
THEIR LIVES.

01:53.110 --> 01:55.146
WE'LL BE THERE FOR THEM.

01:55.146 --> 01:57.415
WE'LL LOVE THEM
MORE THAN ANYTHING.

01:57.415 --> 01:59.417
THAT'S --
THAT'S WHAT MATTERS.

01:59.417 --> 02:01.519
AND THAT'S WHAT'LL GET US
THROUGH THIS.

02:03.654 --> 02:06.157
OH, I SHOULD GO.

02:08.759 --> 02:11.295
IT'S DARK OUTSIDE.

02:11.295 --> 02:13.497
LET ME --
LET ME WALK YOU TO THE CAR.

02:18.502 --> 02:20.137
MM.

02:22.340 --> 02:24.909
I LOVE YOU.

02:24.909 --> 02:27.511
I LIKE THAT.
SAY IT AGAIN.

02:47.098 --> 02:49.333
I TALKED TO MY GUYS
AT THE MORGUE.

02:49.333 --> 02:51.268
THE KORSKAYA CASE
IS CLOSED.

02:51.268 --> 02:55.373
WHAT, THAT SHE DROWNED?
IN A TUB?

02:55.373 --> 02:56.374
OVERDOSE.

02:56.374 --> 02:58.376
IT'S NOT SO SURPRISING.

02:58.376 --> 03:00.444
THESE GIRLS ALL GET MESSED UP
IN THE END.

03:00.444 --> 03:03.647
SO, YOU COPS DON'T THINK SOMEONE
MIGHT'VE KILLED HER.

03:03.647 --> 03:06.217
NOT THAT I'VE HEARD.
DO YOU?

03:08.953 --> 03:12.456
SHE HAD A LITTLE GIRL --
AMY.

03:12.456 --> 03:15.593
DID THEY FIND
THE FATHER YET?

03:15.593 --> 03:17.261
MNH-MNH,
NO RECORD OF THE GUY.

03:17.261 --> 03:18.362
GIRL'S IN THE SYSTEM.

03:18.362 --> 03:20.231
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR
A PERMANENT HOME,

03:20.231 --> 03:22.099
BUT THAT'LL TAKE SOME TIME,
YOU KNOW.

03:22.099 --> 03:24.935
PEOPLE AREN'T EXACTLY LOOKING
TO ADOPT SOME DEAD HOOKER'S KID.

03:24.935 --> 03:27.471
WATCH YOUR MOUTH.

03:27.471 --> 03:30.841
SO, UH, McALLISTER
AIN'T WORKING FOR YOU ANYMORE?

03:30.841 --> 03:32.977
I MEAN, I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND
ME ASKING.

03:32.977 --> 03:36.113
I JUST THOUGHT HE WAS,
YOU KNOW, FAMILY.

03:36.113 --> 03:38.949
ACTUALLY, I DO MIND.

03:42.420 --> 03:43.921
ARE WE DONE?

03:58.702 --> 04:01.439
I DIDN'T HEAR YOU
COME IN.

04:05.242 --> 04:07.545
I PACKED OLIVER'S LUNCH.

04:07.545 --> 04:11.282
THANKS.
THERE'S SOME COFFEE.

04:11.282 --> 04:14.051
I'LL GET SOME
AT THE OFFICE.

04:14.051 --> 04:15.820
THIS IS HARD, I KNOW.

04:18.089 --> 04:19.523
HARD?

04:19.523 --> 04:21.826
WOW.

04:21.826 --> 04:24.361
HEY, HONEY.

04:24.361 --> 04:27.364
MM, YOU EVER GET TO SLEEP?
MM-HMM.

04:27.364 --> 04:30.067
YOU WANT TO PLAY JENGA
WHILE I MAKE BREAKFAST?
NO.

04:30.067 --> 04:32.369
OKAY.
YOU WANT SOME OATMEAL?

04:32.369 --> 04:34.872
I GOT TO RUN.
I GOT AN EARLY MEETING.

04:34.872 --> 04:37.775
BYE, BUDDY.
WAIT!

04:37.775 --> 04:39.910
WHAT ABOUT MOMMY?

04:39.910 --> 04:42.246
OH, DADDY'S IN A HURRY.

04:42.246 --> 04:44.348
KISS MOMMY GOODBYE.

04:55.993 --> 04:57.495
HAVE A GOOD DAY.

04:57.495 --> 04:58.562
NO.

04:58.562 --> 05:00.631
A REAL KISS.

05:00.631 --> 05:02.433
LIKE IN A WEDDING.

05:16.480 --> 05:19.483
-- Captions by VITAC --

05:33.731 --> 05:36.634
WELCOME BACK TO WORK.

05:36.634 --> 05:39.203
IT'S GOOD
TO SEE YOU HERE, SON.

05:39.203 --> 05:43.440
I DON'T WANT TO MOVE
INTO JACK'S OFFICE TODAY.

05:43.440 --> 05:47.711
YEAH, SURE,
I UNDERSTAND.

05:47.711 --> 05:51.115
I DON'T THINK BRANDY
WANTED TO DIE.

05:51.115 --> 05:54.752
SHE WANTED
TO TAKE CARE OF AMY.

05:54.752 --> 05:59.990
SOMETIMES IT'S HARD TO KNOW WHAT
GOES ON INSIDE SOMEONE'S HEAD.

05:59.990 --> 06:03.494
MAYBE,
BUT SOMETIMES IT ISN'T.

06:05.863 --> 06:07.698
T.J...

06:07.698 --> 06:11.202
I KNOW IT MUST'VE BEEN AWFUL
FINDING HER LIKE THAT.

06:11.202 --> 06:15.139
BUT TRY NOT TO DWELL
ON IT.

06:15.139 --> 06:16.974
OKAY?

06:37.561 --> 06:40.397
SARA HANLEY?
NATE GREENE?

06:40.397 --> 06:41.498
THAT'S ME.

06:41.498 --> 06:43.334
THE REPORTER
FROM NEW YORK?

06:43.334 --> 06:44.868
PRECISELY.

06:44.868 --> 06:46.937
Y-YOU WANT TO COME IN?
YEAH.

06:49.974 --> 06:52.476
OH, MAN!

06:52.476 --> 06:56.447
MY APARTMENT IS THE SIZE
OF YOUR BED! OH!

06:56.447 --> 06:59.617
IS IT WORTH IT, REALLY,
LIVING IN MANHATTAN?

06:59.617 --> 07:01.352
YOU KNOW WHAT?
DON'T ANSWER THAT.

07:01.352 --> 07:03.354
I'LL JUST GET DEPRESSED,
AND WHEN I GET DEPRESSED,

07:03.354 --> 07:04.855
I HAVE TO LIE IN BED
BLOWING MITHRIL

07:04.855 --> 07:06.624
ON HOBBIT ARMIES
OF THE THIRD AGE.

07:06.624 --> 07:08.292
YOU HAVE A BAND-AID
BY ANY CHANCE?

07:08.292 --> 07:09.460
NEW SNEAKERS.

07:09.460 --> 07:11.195
SURE.

07:13.631 --> 07:16.934
SO, I REALLY LIKE YOUR ARTICLE
ON THAT HYPOCRITE C.E.O.

07:16.934 --> 07:18.202
MICHAEL BOYD?
YEAH.

07:18.202 --> 07:19.803
WHAT A DOUCHE!

07:19.803 --> 07:22.306
YOUR PICTURES WERE
CRAZY GOOD.

07:22.306 --> 07:25.809
YOU GOT AN EYE FOR SADISM.
THAT'S A COMPLIMENT.
THANKS.

07:25.809 --> 07:28.579
AH, BUZZ LIGHTYEAR.
HOW OLD'S YOUR KID?

07:28.579 --> 07:30.247
HE'LL BE SEVEN IN A MONTH.

07:30.247 --> 07:32.182
DOES HE LIVE HERE
WITH YOU?

07:32.182 --> 07:33.784
NO, HIS, UH, DAD AND I --

07:33.784 --> 07:36.887
IT'S KIND OF COMPLICATED
RIGHT NOW.
OH, YEAH.

07:36.887 --> 07:38.922
MY PARENTS GOT DIVORCED
WHEN I WAS NINE.

07:38.922 --> 07:41.558
SUCKED AT FIRST, BUT THEN
IT BECAME STRANGELY AWESOME.

07:41.558 --> 07:43.527
TWO BIRTHDAY PARTIES.

07:43.527 --> 07:46.463
SO, I KNOW YOU DIDN'T COME
ALL THE WAY HERE FOR A BAND-AID.

07:46.463 --> 07:47.665
HERE IT IS.

07:47.665 --> 07:50.668
YOU KNOW ALL THOSE FORECLOSURES
FROM THE CRASH?

07:50.668 --> 07:52.469
HOMELESS FAMILIES
IN THE SOUTH SIDE

07:52.469 --> 07:54.505
ARE USING BOARDED-UP HOUSES
FOR SHELTER.

07:54.505 --> 07:57.207
THEY'RE GETTING OUSTED
BY REAL-ESTATE DEVELOPERS,

07:57.207 --> 08:00.177
ROUSTED BY CITY OFFICIALS,
FLOUSTED BY COPS.

08:00.177 --> 08:02.613
"FLOUSTED"
ISN'T A WORD, BUT...

08:03.580 --> 08:05.215
MY INTEL SAYS THINGS
ARE GOING DOWN

08:05.215 --> 08:07.151
IN AUBURN GRESHAM RIGHT NOW.
IT'S HEAVY!

08:07.151 --> 08:08.585
THESE PEOPLE HAVE NO RIGHTS.

08:08.585 --> 08:10.554
I WANT US TO TELL
THEIR STORY.

08:12.189 --> 08:13.791
AREN'T YOU GONNA GET
YOUR CAMERA?

08:13.791 --> 08:15.092
OH, I-I DON'T KNOW.

08:15.092 --> 08:19.763
I-I BOOKED THIS JOB ON...
HOME BEEKEEPING.

08:19.763 --> 08:23.334
HANLEY, YOU'RE WASTING
YOUR TALENTS!

08:23.334 --> 08:24.435
TAKE A RISK!

08:24.435 --> 08:25.469
GET MESSY.

08:42.019 --> 08:44.788
THATCHER.
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME?

08:48.625 --> 08:50.728
BRANDY KORSKAYA.

08:50.728 --> 08:53.163
DROWNED IN HER BATHTUB.

08:53.163 --> 08:56.400
UNDER THE INFLUENCE.

08:56.400 --> 08:59.336
HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN?

08:59.336 --> 09:02.506
I GUESS IT WAS
A CONVENIENT TRAGEDY.

09:02.506 --> 09:06.977
SO YOU FIGURED IT OUT
ALL BY YOURSELF

09:06.977 --> 09:09.346
TO SHOW SOME INITIATIVE.
IS THAT IT?

09:09.346 --> 09:13.317
YEAH.

09:13.317 --> 09:14.618
I KNEW WHAT YOU WANTED.

09:18.088 --> 09:19.757
YOU WERE WRONG.

09:19.757 --> 09:22.693
I DID
WHAT NEEDED TO BE DONE.

09:22.693 --> 09:25.729
YOU DON'T DECIDE THAT --
EVER!

09:25.729 --> 09:30.401
I WATCHED YOU
WHEN I WAS A KID.

09:30.401 --> 09:33.904
WHAT I AM,
I LEARNED IT FROM YOU.

09:33.904 --> 09:36.740
YOU KILLED A MOTHER.

09:36.740 --> 09:40.377
YOU MADE HER CHILD
AN ORPHAN.

09:40.377 --> 09:43.914
WHAT DO I TELL MY SON?

09:43.914 --> 09:46.383
FROM NOW ON,

09:46.383 --> 09:50.621
YOU DO EXACTLY WHAT I TELL YOU
AND NOTHING ELSE,

09:50.621 --> 09:53.257
YOU UNDERSTAND?

09:53.257 --> 09:54.792
NOW GET OUT.

10:14.740 --> 10:16.576
IS THERE A CODE WORD?

10:16.576 --> 10:18.244
WHAT?

10:18.244 --> 10:19.938
THIS BENCH THING IS NEAT

10:19.938 --> 10:22.006
VERY "THREE DAYS
OF THE CONDOR."

10:22.006 --> 10:23.241
I'M SORRY.
WHO ARE YOU?

10:23.241 --> 10:24.709
THE QUEEN OF FRANCE.
AND YOU?

10:24.709 --> 10:26.878
DREW STAFFORD.
DREW STAFFORD.
I KNEW IT.

10:26.878 --> 10:28.246
QUINCY THERINGER.

10:28.246 --> 10:29.948
I WAS SUPPOSED TO MEET
SERENA.

10:29.948 --> 10:32.083
SHE QUIT 'CAUSE YOU ANNOYED HER
SO MUCH.

10:32.083 --> 10:33.318
NOT REALLY.

10:33.318 --> 10:35.887
I MEAN, YOU DID ANNOY HER,
BUT THAT'S NOT WHY SHE QUIT.

10:35.887 --> 10:38.022
WELL, WHAT, THEN?
HER HOUSE BURNED DOWN.

10:38.022 --> 10:39.991
HER GRANNY DIED.
SHE BROKE HER TOE.

10:39.991 --> 10:41.859
I'M REALLY NOT AT LIBERTY
TO SAY.

10:41.859 --> 10:43.828
OKAY, MS. THERINGER.
NO ONE CALLS ME THAT.

10:43.828 --> 10:45.196
OKAY, QUINCY.

10:45.196 --> 10:47.865
YOU'RE THE HEAD
OF THE TASK FORCE NOW?
AFFIRMATIVE.

10:47.865 --> 10:49.334
SO YOU KNOW ABOUT
THE LOU MROZEK CASE?

10:49.334 --> 10:51.569
THE CASE IS CLOSED.
YOUR C.I. O.D.'d IN THE TUB.

10:51.569 --> 10:52.837
YEAH,
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT.

10:52.837 --> 10:54.572
I SPENT SOME TIME WITH HER.
THAT GIRL WAS CLEAN.

10:54.572 --> 10:57.075
YOU LOOK PRETTY CLEAN YOURSELF.
EVER KNOWN A DRUG ADDICT?

10:57.075 --> 10:59.544
DON'T ANSWER THAT.
THEY'RE PROFESSIONAL LIARS.

10:59.544 --> 11:02.413
WILL YOU JUST
LOOK AT THIS, PLEASE?

11:02.413 --> 11:04.682
IT'S T.J. KARSTEN'S IMPALA.

11:04.682 --> 11:06.584
IT WAS PARKED AT THE GARAGE
WHERE LIL' D WAS --
WHO?

11:06.584 --> 11:09.187
DARIUS MILLER -- THE KID
THEY'RE SAYING SHOT LOU MROZEK.

11:09.187 --> 11:10.455
HE WORKED AT THE GARAGE.

11:10.455 --> 11:13.958
HIS BOSS TOLD ME THAT LIL' D
FOUND MROZEK'S .38 IN A CAR.

11:13.958 --> 11:16.194
NOW, IF I CAN GET HIM TO ADMIT
THE CAR IN QUESTION

11:16.194 --> 11:17.328
WAS INDEED T.J.'s IMPALA,

11:17.328 --> 11:19.030
WELL, IT'S WHAT I THOUGHT
ALL ALONG.

11:19.030 --> 11:21.566
KARSTEN FAMILY KILLED
ONE OF THEIR OWN.

11:21.566 --> 11:23.901
IT'S A MURDER.
GO TELL YOUR MURDER PEOPLE.

11:23.901 --> 11:25.670
I CAN'T.

11:25.670 --> 11:28.106
HOWARD GOSS DOESN'T WANT
TO HEAR THIS FROM ME.

11:28.106 --> 11:29.107
HE THINKS I'M CRAZY.

11:29.107 --> 11:30.908
WELL, I'M SURE WHEN YOU SHOW
MR. GOSS

11:30.908 --> 11:32.910
A CLIPPING
OF AN ANTIQUE-CAR AUCTION,

11:32.910 --> 11:35.613
HE'LL REVISE HIS OPINION
OF YOU.
JUST ASK SERENA.

11:35.613 --> 11:36.881
I MAY HAVE ANNOYED HER,
BUT SHE AND I HAD --

11:36.881 --> 11:39.083
SERENA IS GONE.
THIS IS A MURDER CASE.

11:39.083 --> 11:40.885
TAKE IT UP WITH YOUR OFFICE,
LIL' DREW.

11:44.222 --> 11:45.323
Hi.

11:45.323 --> 11:47.091
WHAT ARE YOU WEARING --
I MEAN, DOING?

11:47.091 --> 11:53.164
I'M WEARING WHAT I ALWAYS WEAR,
AND I AM PACKING UP LENSES.

11:53.164 --> 11:55.533
Are you nervous
about your meeting?

11:55.533 --> 11:56.601
I SHOULDN'T BE.

11:56.601 --> 11:57.902
I WENT TO LAW SCHOOL
WITH THIS GUY.

11:57.902 --> 11:59.137
HE'S A BIG DEAL NOW.

11:59.137 --> 12:01.072
HIS FIRM'S ONE OF
KARSTEN ALLIED'S BIGGEST RIVALS,

12:01.072 --> 12:03.374
so could be a good fit.

12:03.374 --> 12:04.976
YOU SOUND HOPEFUL.
I LIKE THAT.

12:04.976 --> 12:06.144
How about you?

12:06.144 --> 12:07.945
You're, uh, off to shoot
some home beekeeping?

12:07.945 --> 12:11.249
UH, ACTUALLY, NO.
SOMETHING INTERESTING CAME UP.

12:11.249 --> 12:13.284
MORE INTERESTING
THAT DOMESTICATED BEES?

12:13.284 --> 12:16.154
I DON'T WANT TO JINX IT.
I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT IT LATER.
Okay.

12:16.154 --> 12:18.056
LOOK, I WISH WE COULD HAVE
DINNER, BUT I-I GOT

12:18.056 --> 12:19.757
MY, UH, KIDS' BIRTHDAY TONIGHT,
SO...

12:19.757 --> 12:22.260
WELL, I'LL BE THINKING
ABOUT YOU.

12:22.260 --> 12:25.263
I'M ALWAYS THINKING
ABOUT YOU.

12:25.263 --> 12:29.467
LOOK, SON, I UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH.

12:29.467 --> 12:30.768
I DO, REALLY.

12:30.768 --> 12:34.706
BUT EVERYONE EXPERIENCES
LOSS.

12:34.706 --> 12:37.308
I WENT THROUGH IT
WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE.

12:37.308 --> 12:40.511
AND I SURVIVED.

12:40.511 --> 12:45.683
IF IT DOESN'T KILL YOU,
IT MAKES YOU STRONGER?

12:45.683 --> 12:49.987
YEAH, YEAH,
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

12:49.987 --> 12:53.658
WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?

13:22.453 --> 13:25.256
WHAT IN THE HELL?!

13:25.256 --> 13:26.858
THE NERVE, REALLY!
I AM SO SORRY, MISS DuMOND.

13:26.858 --> 13:28.326
OKAY, YEAH, HOW ARE YOU GONNA
FIX IT, HUH?

13:28.326 --> 13:30.261
OH, I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE IF I DO THIS.

13:30.261 --> 13:32.930
MMM.

13:32.930 --> 13:35.400
SUZANNE?

13:35.400 --> 13:37.935
I'M TIRED OF PRETENDING.

13:37.935 --> 13:39.437
BUT SOME PEOPLE WON'T
UNDERSTAND.

13:39.437 --> 13:41.105
I DON'T CARE.
I LOVE YOU.

13:41.105 --> 13:43.274
SUZANNE?!

13:44.409 --> 13:45.643
GET BACK TO WORK.

13:49.080 --> 13:50.348
HEY, KID.

13:50.348 --> 13:53.284
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE UP TO,
BUT GET ON OUT.

13:54.752 --> 13:57.789
YOU'RE FIRED.

13:57.789 --> 13:59.624
DAD?

13:59.624 --> 14:01.926
DAD?!
HMM?

14:01.926 --> 14:04.429
I DON'T WANT TO WORK HERE
ANYMORE.

14:04.429 --> 14:07.732
T.J.!
I WANT TO LIVE ON MY OWN.

14:07.732 --> 14:11.102
THAT'S NOT PRACTICAL.
IT IS.

14:11.102 --> 14:14.872
SOME THINGS I HAVEN'T DONE
BECAUSE YOU TOLD ME NOT TO,

14:14.872 --> 14:16.407
BUT I CAN DO STUFF!

14:16.407 --> 14:20.144
I WANT TO SEE A NEW DOCTOR
ABOUT CHANGING MY MEDS.

14:20.144 --> 14:23.548
T.J.,
I KNOW YOU'RE IN PAIN.

14:23.548 --> 14:26.918
BUT DON'T USE THAT AS AN EXCUSE
TO BLOW UP YOUR WHOLE LIFE.

14:26.918 --> 14:29.720
JUST A MINUTE!

14:29.720 --> 14:32.924
KEEP WORKING HERE.

14:32.924 --> 14:35.226
LIVE WITH ME.

14:35.226 --> 14:37.929
IT'LL GET BETTER.
I PROMISE.

15:12.797 --> 15:15.266
THE TRUTH IS,
I-I'M READY FOR A CHANGE.

15:15.266 --> 15:17.168
YEAH, SO ARE WE.

15:17.168 --> 15:20.137
I THINK OUR FIRM COULD BE
A GREAT FIT FOR YOU.
ALL RIGHT.

15:20.137 --> 15:21.405
THAT'S GREAT
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,

15:21.405 --> 15:23.074
I'VE GOT A LOT OF EXPERIENCE
WITH LAND USE,

15:23.074 --> 15:25.409
PERMITTING, ENTITLEMENTS,
COMMERCIAL LEASING,

15:25.409 --> 15:27.512
SOME LITIGATION, TOO.
YEAH.

15:27.512 --> 15:30.047
ARE WE SPEAKING IN CODE HERE?

15:30.047 --> 15:33.184
CODE?
JACK...

15:33.184 --> 15:36.721
WHEN I SAID WE WERE INTERESTED
IN YOUR PARTICULAR SKILL SET,

15:36.721 --> 15:38.789
I MEANT THAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR
SOMEONE TO COME IN

15:38.789 --> 15:40.658
AND HELP US GREASE
THE UNIONS, YOU KNOW,

15:40.658 --> 15:43.327
BEND THE E.P.A.
ON OUR WETLANDS PROJECT.

15:43.327 --> 15:45.129
YOU WANT A FIXER.
RIGHT.

15:45.129 --> 15:47.298
WE JUST NEED YOU TO DO
WHAT YOU DO, MAN.

15:47.298 --> 15:50.434
OH, SORRY.

15:50.434 --> 15:51.802
I GOT TO RUN.

15:51.802 --> 15:54.372
ALL RIGHT, HERE.
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

15:54.372 --> 15:56.507
AND WE'LL BE IN TOUCH.

15:58.409 --> 16:00.845
ALL RIGHT,
GREAT CATCHING UP, MAN.
ALL RIGHT, THANKS.

16:13.291 --> 16:15.259
BACK OFF, BACK OFF!

16:17.094 --> 16:19.030
OKAY, TEAM,
HERE'S THE PLAN.

16:19.030 --> 16:21.299
I'M GONNA TRY AND GET
A STATEMENT WHILE YOU...

16:21.299 --> 16:22.700
DOCUMENT THE FLOUSTING.

16:22.700 --> 16:25.836
IT'S RISKY, BUT YOU GOT TO TAKE
RISK BY THE BALLS!

16:25.836 --> 16:27.772
JUST...KILL IT!

16:27.772 --> 16:30.408
KILL THE RISK!
THAT'S THE WEIRDEST PEP TALK
EVER.

16:35.212 --> 16:37.114
YOU STOP!

16:37.114 --> 16:38.449
MOVE BACK!

16:40.051 --> 16:41.118
YOU GOT TO BE
KIDDING ME!

17:00.771 --> 17:02.873
STAY BACK!
NO PICTURES!

17:04.208 --> 17:05.309
OKAY, THAT'S IT!

17:05.309 --> 17:06.611
LET GO!

17:06.611 --> 17:08.212
LET GO!
NATE GREENE!

17:08.212 --> 17:09.981
THIS IS MY COLLEAGUE,
SARA HANLEY!

17:09.981 --> 17:12.216
YEAH, WELL,
YOU'RE BOTH UNDER ARREST!

17:12.216 --> 17:14.986
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE!WE'RE NOT OBSTRUCTING ANYTHING!

17:14.986 --> 17:16.487
WE HAVE A RIGHT
TO BE HERE!

17:16.487 --> 17:17.955
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT!

17:17.955 --> 17:19.323
OW!
YOU SHOULD USE THAT, HUH?

17:19.323 --> 17:20.458
YOU KNOW A GOOD LAWYER?

17:20.458 --> 17:23.094
ACTUALLY, I KNOW TWO.

17:25.853 --> 17:27.288
AH, WHAT AN AMAZING DAY!

17:27.288 --> 17:29.699
YEAH!

17:29.699 --> 17:32.264
I MEAN, LOOK AT THE SKY!

17:32.264 --> 17:34.366
I'M SO PSYCHED
THAT WE CAME OUT HERE TODAY!

17:34.366 --> 17:35.935
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, NEPHEW!

17:35.935 --> 17:39.071
HEY, I'M PRETTY SURE
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE
BOOZE WITH YOUR PILLS.

17:39.071 --> 17:41.807
NO.
I'M NOT ON MY PILLS!

17:43.309 --> 17:47.146
NO, I-I-I'M TIRED OF ANYTHING
HOLDING ME BACK!

17:47.146 --> 17:49.715
FROM NOW ON,
ANYTHING THAT HOLDS ME BACK,

17:49.715 --> 17:51.083
I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR!

17:51.083 --> 17:53.919
IS THAT OKAY?

17:53.919 --> 17:55.421
I MEAN,
WHAT'D THE DOCTOR SAY?

17:55.421 --> 17:57.923
IT'S FINE!

17:57.923 --> 18:00.025
LOOK,
THINGS ARE GONNA CHANGE.

18:00.025 --> 18:01.627
THEY'RE GONNA GET BETTER!

18:01.627 --> 18:04.063
IT'S GOOD!
IT IS!

18:04.063 --> 18:06.298
IT IS!
I'M IN THE CLEAR!

18:06.298 --> 18:07.800
DON'T BE WORRIED.

18:07.800 --> 18:10.502
NOW, COME ON, I-I PICKED YOU UP
TO BRING YOU OUT HERE

18:10.502 --> 18:12.538
TO HAVE A GOOD TIME
ON YOUR BIRTHDAY!

18:12.538 --> 18:13.973
NOW LET'S HAVE SOME FUN!

18:21.747 --> 18:23.248
WE WEREN'T DOING
ANYTHING, JACK!

18:23.248 --> 18:25.050
THEY ARRESTED US
FOR JUST STANDING THERE.

18:25.050 --> 18:27.252
JUST STANDING THERE
WITH A CAMERA.
IS THAT A CRIME?

18:27.252 --> 18:28.954
NO, NEIN, NYET.

18:28.954 --> 18:30.456
SHOULD WE FILE
A COMPLAINT?

18:30.456 --> 18:32.925
NE -- THAT'S BULGARIAN.
YES, I'LL FILE A COMPLAINT.

18:32.925 --> 18:35.160
GOOD, I'LL GO BACK,
GET MORE SHOTS.
THAT'S MY GIRL!

18:35.160 --> 18:36.462
IT'S NICE
TO MEET YOU, NATE.

18:36.462 --> 18:39.064
HEY, THANKS
FOR BAILING US OUT.

18:39.064 --> 18:42.334
I'LL CALL YOU
WITH OUR NEXT MOVE.
WHAT NEXT MOVE?

18:42.334 --> 18:44.503
FORGET ABOUT THE BEES, HANLEY.
YOU'RE AN OUTLAW NOW.

18:49.775 --> 18:51.677
YOU ALL RIGHT?

18:51.677 --> 18:54.313
YEAH, I

18:54.313 --> 18:57.616
I JUST CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT
THIS LITTLE BOY.

18:57.616 --> 18:59.852
HE WAS
BARELY OLIVER'S AGE.

18:59.852 --> 19:01.520
YOU SEEM ENERGIZED,
MOTIVATED.

19:01.520 --> 19:03.822
I'M KIND OF JEALOUS,
ACTUALLY.

19:03.822 --> 19:07.192
YOUR MEETING DIDN'T GO WELL?

19:07.192 --> 19:10.629
NO, I WAS NAIVE TO THINK I COULD
GET A LEGIT JOB IN CHICAGO.

19:10.629 --> 19:15.067
HEY, YOU CAN START AGAIN,
DO SOMETHING ELSE.

19:15.067 --> 19:16.969
LET'S GO.
I'LL BUY YOU A DRINK.

19:16.969 --> 19:19.304
I WISH, BUT I-I GOT
THIS BIRTHDAY PARTY.

19:19.304 --> 19:21.340
I HOPE THEY'LL LET ME IN.

19:21.340 --> 19:23.842
THEY'LL BE HAPPY
TO SEE YOU.

19:23.842 --> 19:26.011
HEY.

19:26.011 --> 19:30.182
DID YOU EVER THINK YOU'D HAVE TO
BAIL ME OUT OF JAIL?

19:36.922 --> 19:40.392
LET'S GIVE YOU A LIFT,
OUTLAW.

19:48.200 --> 19:53.172
I'M SORRY ABOUT BEFORE --
OUR MISUNDERSTANDING.

19:53.172 --> 19:55.474
I WANT TO MAKE IT UP
TO YOU.

19:55.474 --> 19:58.177
I KNOW...

19:58.177 --> 20:00.646
I KNOW WE NEED THE UNIONS
TO RAISE THEIR ESTIMATES

20:00.646 --> 20:02.214
ON THE STREETERVILLE PROJECT,
RIGHT?

20:02.214 --> 20:03.615
SO WE CAN PAD THE BUDGET

20:03.615 --> 20:06.151
BEFORE YOUR BIG MEETING
WITH THE INVESTORS.

20:06.151 --> 20:07.986
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO
WITH YOU?

20:07.986 --> 20:12.825
I CAN DEAL WITH THE UNION,
BE A LIAISON.

20:12.825 --> 20:15.994
I CAN LEARN TO DO THE STUFF
THE WAY JACK DID,

20:15.994 --> 20:17.229
HOW YOU NEED IT.

20:17.229 --> 20:20.566
I CAME TO YOU
SO YOU WOULD SIGN OFF.

20:20.566 --> 20:23.402
I'LL KEEP YOU INFORMED
EVERY STEP OF THE WAY.

20:23.402 --> 20:25.871
GIVE ME ANOTHER SHOT.

20:25.871 --> 20:28.540
GIVE ME ANOTHER SHOT, ANGELO.

20:28.540 --> 20:31.443
I WON'T SCREW UP AGAIN.
ALL RIGHT.

20:31.443 --> 20:34.613
NO MORE LAZING AROUND.
NO MORE...

20:34.613 --> 20:36.882
...FRATERNIZING
WITH THE TALENT.

20:36.882 --> 20:37.916
I-I NEVER --
SHUT UP!

20:37.916 --> 20:40.719
WANT THE JOB BACK OR NOT?
YEAH, I NEED IT.

20:40.719 --> 20:43.255
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

20:43.255 --> 20:45.924
KEEP YOUR EYES DOWN
AND YOUR MOUTH SHUT.

20:45.924 --> 20:49.728
WE'LL SEE HOW IT GOES.
YEAH.

20:51.697 --> 20:53.265
HEY, KID...

20:53.265 --> 20:56.869
I SEE YOU LOOK
AT THAT COLORED GIRL AGAIN...

20:56.869 --> 20:59.471
I'M GONNA STICK YOU
WITH THIS.

20:59.471 --> 21:00.539
YOU GOT IT?

21:05.711 --> 21:08.380
OKAY.

21:08.380 --> 21:10.415
ONE MORE SHOT.

21:17.656 --> 21:19.758
DID YOU HAVE FUN
IN ART CLASS?

21:19.758 --> 21:20.826
WE MADE MASKS.

21:20.826 --> 21:23.662
MINE IS RED WITH BLUE STRIPES,
LIKE A TIGER.

21:23.662 --> 21:26.865
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE IT.

21:37.643 --> 21:41.480
OLLIE...
DID YOU TAKE THIS?

21:41.480 --> 21:44.383
WHAT SOUND DOES
A GIRAFFE MAKE?

21:47.319 --> 21:51.490
OLIVER, DID YOU --
DID YOU TAKE THESE FROM SCHOOL?

21:51.490 --> 21:53.325
I WON'T BE MAD.

21:53.325 --> 21:56.428
IT'S A GIRAFFE DOG.

22:00.132 --> 22:02.601
UM, OKAY, WELL...

22:02.601 --> 22:06.371
HAVE YOU BEEN WORRIED
ABOUT ANYTHING?

22:06.371 --> 22:09.641
SOMETHING ON YOUR MIND?

22:18.016 --> 22:19.318
WHAT IS IT, HONEY?

22:19.318 --> 22:22.521
I HAD A BAD DREAM.

22:22.521 --> 22:24.957
I CALLED YOU,
BUT YOU DIDN'T COME.

22:24.957 --> 22:28.327
OH.
DID DADDY COME?

22:28.327 --> 22:31.330
UH-HUH.
BUT I WANTED YOU.

22:31.330 --> 22:34.066
WHERE WERE YOU, MOMMY?

22:34.066 --> 22:35.467
DADDY DIDN'T TELL ME.

22:46.211 --> 22:49.081
HEY, JACK.

22:49.081 --> 22:51.750
HEY.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

22:51.750 --> 22:53.652
I DROVE THATCHER OVER.

22:53.652 --> 22:55.587
CONGRATULATIONS.

22:55.587 --> 22:57.322
YOUR KIDS ARE
PRACTICALLY ADULTS.

22:57.322 --> 22:58.757
YEAH.

22:58.757 --> 23:02.928
I COULD USE A LITTLE ADVICE,
IF YOU DON'T MIND.

23:02.928 --> 23:05.864
I GOT TO MEET
WITH A UNION REP

23:05.864 --> 23:07.766
ABOUT
THE STREETERVILLE BUDGET.

23:07.766 --> 23:09.701
I REACHED OUT
TO DIBINSKY.

23:09.701 --> 23:11.603
HE GAVE ME
THE BRUSH-OFF.

23:11.603 --> 23:13.772
WHO ELSE CAN I TALK TO?

23:13.772 --> 23:16.275
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T REALLY CARE ANYMORE.

23:17.409 --> 23:19.378
WE'VE HAD
OUR DISAGREEMENTS.

23:19.378 --> 23:21.146
BUT WE'RE STILL FAMILY,
RIGHT?

23:21.146 --> 23:22.881
WE CAN'T LET
THE OLD MAN DOWN.

23:22.881 --> 23:25.217
JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE, YOU KNOW,
IN THE SITUATION YOU ARE,

23:25.217 --> 23:26.852
IT DON'T MEAN
YOU SHOULD ABANDON HIM.

23:26.852 --> 23:28.921
I'M SORRY.
YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.

23:30.188 --> 23:33.125
I CLEANED EVERYTHING UP FOR YOU,
JACK.

23:33.125 --> 23:34.726
FOR YOU AND FOR T.J.

23:34.726 --> 23:36.762
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

23:36.762 --> 23:39.765
DON'T PRETEND LIKE
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW IT IS.

23:39.765 --> 23:43.001
SOMEONE HAD TO GET RID OF
THAT GIRL.

24:01.191 --> 24:03.126
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE COMING.

24:03.126 --> 24:05.629
WELL, IT'S THEIR BIRTHDAY.
OF COURSE I WAS GONNA COME.

24:05.629 --> 24:07.364
YEAH, BUT YOU CAN'T
JUST SHOW UP.

24:07.364 --> 24:08.765
YOU HAVE TO LET ME KNOW.

24:08.765 --> 24:10.033
I CALLED A FEW TIMES.

24:10.033 --> 24:11.368
YOU DON'T LIVE HERE
ANYMORE.

24:11.368 --> 24:13.203
IT'S MY HOUSE, TOO.

24:13.203 --> 24:16.339
NO, IT ISN'T.
IT REALLY ISN'T.

24:16.339 --> 24:20.777
YOU NEED AN ENGINEER TO OPEN
A BOTTLE OF WINE AROUND HERE.

24:23.113 --> 24:24.881
JACK.

24:24.881 --> 24:26.550
THATCHER.

24:29.553 --> 24:32.122
HARD TO BELIEVE
THE KIDS ARE 17 NOW.

24:32.122 --> 24:34.024
YOU'RE FEELING NOSTALGIC,
GRAMPS?

24:34.024 --> 24:35.559
WHERE ARE THE KIDS?

24:35.559 --> 24:37.360
VIC IS ON HIS WAY HERE
WITH T.J.,

24:37.360 --> 24:39.296
AND VAL IS UPSTAIRS
RAIDING MY CLOSET.

24:39.296 --> 24:42.632
I GUESS
YOU'RE STUCK WITH US.

24:47.037 --> 24:51.341
HEY, BIRTHDAY GIRL.
OH, HI, DAD.

24:51.341 --> 24:54.277
I DIDN'T THINK
YOU WERE COMING.

24:54.277 --> 24:55.579
I WOULDN'T MISS IT.

24:55.579 --> 24:57.881
I WAS WAITING FOR YOU
DOWNSTAIRS.

24:57.881 --> 25:01.151
GUESS I GOT DISTRACTED.

25:01.151 --> 25:04.888
UH, I GOT THIS FOR YOU.
THANKS.

25:04.888 --> 25:08.358
I'M GOING TO THE CLUB
WITH JULES LATER.

25:08.358 --> 25:10.427
WHICH ONE?

25:11.595 --> 25:13.530
I REMEMBER YOU USED TO PLAY
THIS GAME WITH ME

25:13.530 --> 25:15.932
WHEN YOU WERE LITTLE,
MAYBE 9 OR 10 YEARS OLD.

25:18.201 --> 25:20.670
EXCEPT THE CLOTHES
ACTUALLY FIT NOW.

25:20.670 --> 25:22.472
YEAH, THEY DO.

25:25.875 --> 25:28.612
DAD, ARE YOU OKAY?

25:28.612 --> 25:33.617
YEAH, I WAS JUST...
THINKING BACK.

25:38.288 --> 25:41.358
I CAN'T IMAGINE YOU
BEING WITH ANYONE BUT MOM.

25:48.365 --> 25:50.033
YOU'RE NEVER COMING BACK,
ARE YOU?

25:54.337 --> 25:57.107
OH, YEAH, ALL RIGHT!

25:57.107 --> 25:58.108
HAVE YOU BEEN DRINKING?

25:58.108 --> 25:59.542
NO.
I HAVE.

25:59.542 --> 26:01.578
I DIDN'T LET HIM DRIVE.

26:01.578 --> 26:03.146
HE OFFERED ME SOME.
I DIDN'T TAKE IT.

26:03.146 --> 26:05.415
T.J., YOU KNOW YOU SHOULDN'T
DRINK WITH YOUR MEDS.

26:05.415 --> 26:08.251
I'M NOT ON MY MEDS.
FOR HOW LONG?

26:08.251 --> 26:10.787
WHO -- WHO KNOWS?

26:10.787 --> 26:12.255
SHOULD WE GET HIM
SOME COFFEE?

26:12.255 --> 26:13.957
HE MIGHT NEED
MORE THAN COFFEE.

26:13.957 --> 26:16.893
THE ROOM IS SPINNING HERE.
COME ON, SIT DOWN.

26:16.893 --> 26:18.728
I'M GONNA SIT DOWN.
YEAH.

26:21.064 --> 26:23.800
VAL!

26:23.800 --> 26:26.936
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
IT'S GONNA BE AWESOME!

26:42.819 --> 26:44.154
HE'S ASLEEP.

26:44.154 --> 26:45.555
I HEARD ABOUT
THE ARREST TODAY.

26:45.555 --> 26:47.090
THE BOOKING OFFICER
GAVE ME A CALL.

26:47.090 --> 26:49.426
I WAS GOING TO TELL YOU.
I WAS COVERING A STORY.

26:49.426 --> 26:51.628
FORGET IT.
NONE OF MY BUSINESS.

26:51.628 --> 26:54.798
OLLIE HAD A BAD DREAM, AND
HE WANTED TO KNOW WHERE I WAS.

26:54.798 --> 26:57.834
WELL, I CONSIDERED TELLING HIM
YOU HAD AN AFFAIR.

26:57.834 --> 27:01.638
DREW, PLEASE.
HE SENSES SOMETHING'S WRONG.

27:01.638 --> 27:03.707
HE STOLE STUFF
FROM SCHOOL.

27:03.707 --> 27:06.476
HE WHAT?
SCHOOL SUPPLIES.

27:06.476 --> 27:08.445
HE WON'T LOOK AT ME.
HE WON'T TALK TO ME.

27:08.445 --> 27:11.047
HE'S ANXIOUS.
HE'S NOT HIMSELF.

27:11.047 --> 27:13.116
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

27:13.116 --> 27:14.651
YOU SHOULD'VE THOUGHT OF THAT
BEFORE.

27:14.651 --> 27:16.619
DREW, LISTEN TO ME.

27:16.619 --> 27:19.889
HE KNOWS.
WE HAVE TO TALK TO HIM.

27:25.995 --> 27:27.664
T.J.'s SLEEPING IT OFF.

27:27.664 --> 27:29.165
I'M SORRY.

27:29.165 --> 27:30.800
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT,
BABY.

27:30.800 --> 27:33.737
AWESOME BIRTHDAY, RIGHT?

27:33.737 --> 27:35.538
OKAY, YOU TWO,
LET'S, UH, GO IN THE KITCHEN

27:35.538 --> 27:37.741
AND HAVE SOME CAKE.

27:41.244 --> 27:44.180
HEY, UH,
I GOT THIS FOR YOU.

27:45.849 --> 27:48.918
KEEP IT.
I DON'T NEED ANYTHING FROM YOU.

27:51.654 --> 27:54.124
TEENAGERS --
IT'S NEVER EASY.

27:55.525 --> 27:57.827
I REMEMBER
WHEN T.J. WAS HIS AGE.

27:57.827 --> 27:59.229
WHY IS T.J. OFF HIS MEDS?

27:59.229 --> 28:01.097
HOW SHOULD I KNOW?

28:01.097 --> 28:04.534
HE'S UPSET --
ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS.

28:04.534 --> 28:07.837
YOUR SITUATION
DOESN'T HELP ANY.

28:07.837 --> 28:09.439
THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT,
THATCHER.

28:09.439 --> 28:12.776
WE BOTH KNOW WHAT IT IS.

28:12.776 --> 28:14.711
YOU DID IT, DIDN'T YOU?

28:14.711 --> 28:17.480
YOU HAD THAT GIRL KILLED.

28:17.480 --> 28:20.183
AND WHY WOULD I DO THAT?

28:20.183 --> 28:21.718
YOU THOUGHT
SHE'D TURNED ON US.

28:21.718 --> 28:24.020
I DIDN'T THINK IT, JACK.
SHE DID.

28:24.020 --> 28:26.022
SO YOU ADMIT IT?

28:26.022 --> 28:28.691
I DON'T ADMIT TO ANYTHING.

28:28.691 --> 28:30.059
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

28:30.059 --> 28:32.429
YOU EITHER WORK FOR ME
OR YOU DON'T,

28:32.429 --> 28:33.963
AND RIGHT NOW, YOU DON'T.

28:33.963 --> 28:37.133
SO THIS IS NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS.

28:37.133 --> 28:39.135
YOU WALKED AWAY
FROM THIS FAMILY.

28:39.135 --> 28:41.604
I GAVE YOU EVERYTHING,
AND WHAT DID YOU DO?

28:41.604 --> 28:43.807
YOU PISSED IT ALL AWAY!
FOR WHAT?

28:43.807 --> 28:45.708
SOME OTHER GUY'S WIFE?

28:45.708 --> 28:47.811
WITH A FAMILY OF HER OWN.

28:47.811 --> 28:49.646
YOUR PATHETIC
MIDLIFE CRISIS.

28:49.646 --> 28:51.114
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT ME
NOW.

28:51.114 --> 28:52.148
NO, WE'RE NOT.

28:52.148 --> 28:53.583
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ME

28:53.583 --> 28:56.719
BECAUSE I KNOW
THAT LIFE IS COMPLICATED.

28:56.719 --> 29:00.623
I APOLOGIZE FOR NOTHING.

29:05.728 --> 29:09.098
YOU'VE HAD TOO MANY DRINKS,
ANGELO. STOP, PLEASE!

29:09.098 --> 29:10.733
STOP, PLEASE!

29:10.733 --> 29:13.169
ANGELO, STOP!

29:13.169 --> 29:14.637
NO, PLEASE!
GET OFF HER!

29:14.637 --> 29:15.705
GET OUT OF HERE!

29:17.574 --> 29:19.442
I WARNED YOU!
DON'T! IT'S OKAY!

29:19.442 --> 29:21.511
JUST LEAVE US ALONE!
ANGELO, NO, DON'T HURT HIM!

29:21.511 --> 29:24.180
UNH!

29:24.180 --> 29:25.982
LISTEN TO ME...
OHH!

29:25.982 --> 29:28.284
IT'S OKAY! JUST GO!
EASY, KID!

29:28.284 --> 29:30.587
DON'T! IT'S OKAY!
PLEASE JUST GO!
TAKE IT EASY!

29:30.587 --> 29:33.156
JUST WALK AWAY.
NEVER TOUCH HER AGAIN!
SAY IT!

29:33.156 --> 29:35.291
SAY IT!
I'M BEGGING YOU...

29:35.291 --> 29:38.228
I'LL NEVER TOUCH...

29:38.228 --> 29:40.263
THAT WHORE...AGAIN.

29:40.263 --> 29:41.264
NO...

29:41.264 --> 29:42.565
UNH!
AAH!

29:48.171 --> 29:50.807
UNH!

29:53.343 --> 29:56.846
NO!

30:03.553 --> 30:08.324
WHATEVER ZAREK DID --
THAT'S ON YOU.

30:08.324 --> 30:11.561
YOU SET IT INTO MOTION.

30:15.498 --> 30:18.101
WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES,
JACK.

30:21.371 --> 30:24.107
ONLY SOME OF THEM
ARE REDEEMABLE.

30:36.632 --> 30:38.173
■

30:38.173 --> 30:42.848
GROWN-UPS SOMETIMES NEED
SOME TIME AWAY FROM EACH OTHER.

30:43.564 --> 30:45.994
SO WE CAME UP WITH THIS PLAN

30:45.994 --> 30:48.797
THAT I'M GONNA SPEND SOME NIGHTS
AT MY STUDIO,

30:48.797 --> 30:51.867
AND THEN OTHER NIGHTS,
I'M GONNA BE HERE WITH YOU.

30:51.867 --> 30:55.470
AND THAT WAY, WE BOTH GET TO
SPEND A LOT OF TIME WITH YOU.

30:57.272 --> 30:58.540
OKAY?

31:01.443 --> 31:04.112
AND THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH YOU.

31:04.112 --> 31:05.647
IT'S NOTHING YOU DID.

31:07.849 --> 31:09.284
OKAY?

31:09.284 --> 31:13.955
MOMMY AND I WILL...

31:13.955 --> 31:17.058
WILL ALWAYS BE YOUR PARENTS,
AND WE'LL ALWAYS BE A FAMILY.

31:17.058 --> 31:21.463
WE LOVE YOU SO MUCH.
WE LOVE YOU SO MUCH, HONEY.

31:21.463 --> 31:23.832
YOU'RE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
IN THE WORLD TO US, OLLIE.

31:23.832 --> 31:26.101
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

31:28.770 --> 31:30.672
IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU WANT TO SAY?

31:39.014 --> 31:42.284
I STOLE SOME THINGS
FROM MY CLASSROOM.

31:42.284 --> 31:44.085
I'M SORRY.

32:23.692 --> 32:27.128
HI.

32:32.467 --> 32:34.936
OH, I MISSED YOU.

32:38.807 --> 32:40.909
THEO KRSTANSKY.

32:40.909 --> 32:42.344
I CHANGED MY NAME.

32:42.344 --> 32:45.480
THATCHER KARSTEN.
SEEMS MORE RESPECTABLE.

32:45.480 --> 32:49.017
I LIKE YOUR OLD NAME
BETTER.

32:50.585 --> 32:53.488
THEY'RE SELLING
THIS PLACE.

32:53.488 --> 32:54.789
I MIGHT HEAD TO DETROIT.

32:54.789 --> 32:57.492
YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHERE
IT'S REALLY HAPPENING NOW, SO...

32:57.492 --> 32:58.526
NO, YOU GOT TO STAY HERE.

32:58.526 --> 32:59.961
SOME GUYS FROM
THE OLD NEIGHBORHOOD --

32:59.961 --> 33:01.363
THEY'RE STARTING
A JAZZ LABEL.

33:01.363 --> 33:03.098
I COULD GET YOU
A RECORD DEAL.

33:03.098 --> 33:04.933
NO, I...
I DON'T WANT YOUR HELP.

33:04.933 --> 33:08.737
SUZANNE --
I SAW SOMETHING IN YOU!

33:08.737 --> 33:12.107
A RAGE, AND I DON'T WANT
THAT IN MY LIFE.
PLEASE!

33:12.107 --> 33:14.009
NO, A-ARE YOU AT LEAST SORRY
THAT YOU DID IT?

33:14.009 --> 33:15.410
NO, I'M NOT SORRY!

33:15.410 --> 33:17.178
THEO...
I DID IT FOR YOU!

33:17.178 --> 33:19.381
THEO, NO, YOU DID IT
FOR YOURSELF!

33:19.381 --> 33:21.049
SUZANNE --
I GOT TO GO.

33:21.049 --> 33:21.917
SUZANNE!

33:21.917 --> 33:23.852
SUZANNE!

33:42.637 --> 33:47.609
I REMEMBER WHEN WE BROUGHT
OLIVER HOME FROM THE HOSPITAL.

33:47.609 --> 33:52.480
HE WAS SO TINY AND HELPLESS,
AND I WAS SO SCARED.

33:52.480 --> 33:56.251
BUT YOU KNEW WHAT TO DO.

33:56.251 --> 33:59.721
THIS MAKES NO SENSE.

33:59.721 --> 34:02.757
WE'VE BEEN GOOD TOGETHER.

34:02.757 --> 34:04.459
WE LOVED EACH OTHER.

34:04.459 --> 34:06.328
I THINK...WE STILL DO.

34:06.328 --> 34:09.898
YEAH, OF COURSE.
LET'S JUST TRY AGAIN.

34:09.898 --> 34:12.901
CAN WE? I MEAN, NOT JUST FOR
OLIVER'S SAKE BUT FOR ALL OF US.

34:12.901 --> 34:15.937
YOU MADE A MISTAKE.

34:15.937 --> 34:19.240
WE CAN GET OVER IT.
I CAN GET OVER IT.

34:19.240 --> 34:21.176
I KNOW I HAVEN'T BEEN
THE BEST HUSBAND.

34:21.176 --> 34:22.844
DREW, PLEASE --
NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.

34:22.844 --> 34:27.449
I TOOK YOU FOR GRANTED,
AND FOR THAT, I AM...SO SORRY.

34:27.449 --> 34:30.285
BUT I CAN BE BETTER.

34:30.285 --> 34:33.221
JUST...
LET'S TRY AGAIN.

34:35.523 --> 34:37.425
I LOVE YOU.

34:37.425 --> 34:41.129
YOU...
CAN'T YOU HEAR WHAT I'M SAYING?

34:41.129 --> 34:45.667
YEAH, UH, YEAH.
IT'S -- IT'S JUST, UM...

34:45.667 --> 34:49.971
IT'S SO HARD TO TALK ABOUT.

34:52.340 --> 34:55.610
IT'S JUST --
IT'S NOT A CASUAL THING.

34:55.610 --> 34:58.279
I HAVE FEELINGS --

34:58.279 --> 35:00.982
DON'T SAY ANY MORE.

35:00.982 --> 35:02.317
I GET IT.

35:02.317 --> 35:03.752
YOU'RE DONE.

35:05.653 --> 35:07.756
YOU'RE JUST DONE.

35:15.196 --> 35:17.899
THANKS FOR BRINGING ME IN
ON THIS, THATCH.

35:17.899 --> 35:20.135
HERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENING.

35:20.135 --> 35:22.337
I TOLD THIS IMPORTER
WE'D MEET HIM HERE.

35:22.337 --> 35:25.206
THERE'S A BIG SHIPMENT OF STEEL
COMING IN.

35:25.206 --> 35:27.675
THIS GUY IS GIVING ME
A HARD TIME.

35:27.675 --> 35:30.378
SO I, UH, I NEED YOU
TO WORK WITH HIM,

35:30.378 --> 35:32.047
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

35:32.047 --> 35:35.016
THIS I CAN HANDLE.
YEAH.

35:35.016 --> 35:38.319
YOU KNOW, I'VE ALSO BEEN TALKING
WITH THE UNION.

35:38.319 --> 35:41.022
IT'S JUST LIKE JACK SAYS --

35:41.022 --> 35:42.757
YOU'RE NOT JACK.

35:44.092 --> 35:46.027
AND YOU NEVER WILL BE.

36:26.112 --> 36:27.989
OH, SARA.

36:27.989 --> 36:29.957
COME BACK TO BED.

36:31.657 --> 36:34.761
OLIVER NEEDS A MOTHER.

36:34.761 --> 36:38.431
NOT HALF TIME,
ALL THE TIME.

36:38.431 --> 36:41.167
HOW CAN I BE SO SELFISH?

36:43.770 --> 36:46.506
YOU'RE NOT BEING SELFISH.

36:46.506 --> 36:49.475
IT'S DIFFERENT FOR YOU.

36:49.475 --> 36:53.146
YOUR KIDS ARE GROWN UP.
OLIVER'S SIX.

36:56.091 --> 36:59.394
YOU'LL STILL BE HIS MOTHER
E-EVERY MOMENT OF EVERY DAY.

37:01.830 --> 37:05.934
OH, WE CAN TELL OURSELVES THAT,
BUT I'M AFRAID.

37:05.934 --> 37:08.870
I'M AFRAID
HE'LL NEVER BE HAPPY.

37:12.741 --> 37:16.244
I JUST WANT HIM
TO BE HAPPY.

37:16.244 --> 37:19.948
I JUST WANT HIM TO BE HAPPY.

37:31.059 --> 37:32.494
HEY, BUD.

37:32.494 --> 37:35.363
WHAT ARE YOU DRAWING?

37:35.363 --> 37:39.167
ME, MOMMY, AND YOU.

37:39.167 --> 37:41.970
MM.
THAT'S AWESOME.

37:41.970 --> 37:43.772
I ESPECIALLY LIKE
MY FLUFFY HAIR.

37:43.772 --> 37:45.841
IN THE PICTURE
YOU NEED A HAIRCUT.

37:49.578 --> 37:52.080
YOU KNOW,
WHEN I WAS A KID,

37:52.080 --> 37:54.516
SOME THINGS HAPPENED
THAT WERE HARD FOR ME.

37:54.516 --> 37:56.384
SOMETIMES
I WAS A LITTLE SCARED.

37:58.386 --> 38:01.089
DID GRANDMA EVER HAVE TO SLEEP
AT HER STUDIO?

38:01.089 --> 38:06.194
NOT EXACTLY, BUT SHE HAD TO
RAISE US KIDS ON HER OWN.

38:06.194 --> 38:08.530
'CAUSE YOUR DAD WENT AWAY.

38:08.530 --> 38:10.265
THAT'S RIGHT.

38:10.265 --> 38:12.934
WHERE DID HE GO?
I DON'T KNOW.

38:12.934 --> 38:16.204
HE HAD SOME BIG PROBLEMS.
JUST LEFT.

38:16.204 --> 38:21.243
AND GRANDMA HAD TO WORK...
REALLY HARD.

38:21.243 --> 38:24.412
AND SOMETIMES I WISHED THINGS
WEREN'T THE WAY THEY WERE,

38:24.412 --> 38:25.547
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

38:25.547 --> 38:27.182
WHAT?

38:27.182 --> 38:29.384
EVERYBODY HAS CHALLENGES.

38:29.384 --> 38:31.219
LIKE IN BASEBALL.

38:31.219 --> 38:33.488
EXACTLY LIKE THAT.

38:33.488 --> 38:35.257
LIKE, IF THE GAME DOESN'T
GO YOUR WAY --

38:35.257 --> 38:38.226
O-OR YOU FORGET YOUR MITT
ONE TIME.

38:38.226 --> 38:39.795
ARE YOU STILL THINKING
ABOUT THAT?

38:39.795 --> 38:41.263
I REALLY WANTED MY MITT.

38:43.365 --> 38:46.701
IT'S NOT EASY TO REMEMBER THINGS
ALL THE TIME, OLLIE.

38:49.237 --> 38:52.474
GROWN-UPS FORGET.

38:52.474 --> 38:55.644
THEY MAKE MISTAKES
AND MESS UP.

38:59.281 --> 39:02.584
I WANT YOU TO KNOW
I'LL ALWAYS BE HERE FOR YOU.

39:02.584 --> 39:03.919
ALWAYS.

39:03.919 --> 39:05.020
I KNOW, DAD.

39:05.020 --> 39:08.557
GOOD.

39:08.557 --> 39:10.192
SO...

39:10.192 --> 39:12.561
MOMMY'S GONNA COME BY
THIS AFTERNOON,

39:12.561 --> 39:14.362
AND SHE'S GONNA STAY
FOR A COUPLE DAYS.

39:14.362 --> 39:16.765
AND THEN I'LL BE BACK.

39:16.765 --> 39:18.533
COOL?
COOL.

39:44.593 --> 39:46.661
THEY'RE GOOD PEOPLE.

39:46.661 --> 39:49.865
TWO BOYS AT HOME, BUT
THEY ALWAYS WANTED A DAUGHTER.

39:49.865 --> 39:52.734
BEEN TRYING TO ADOPT
FOR YEARS.

39:52.734 --> 39:54.369
WHAT DO THEY KNOW
ABOUT OUR ARRANGEMENT?

39:54.369 --> 39:56.972
UH, AN ANONYMOUS PATRON
SET UP A TRUST.

39:56.972 --> 39:59.841
THEY'RE GRATEFUL
FOR THE HELP.

39:59.841 --> 40:02.277
I'D LIKE TO KNOW
HOW SHE'S DOING,

YOU KNOW,
THE OCCASIONAL UPDATE.

40:04.913 --> 40:06.147
MAYBE A PHOTO.

40:06.147 --> 40:08.483
