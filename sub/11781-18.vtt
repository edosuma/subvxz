00:06.274 --> 00:07.275
That's me. Jane Quimby.

00:07.308 --> 00:09.543
My life is a little
complicated right now.

00:09.577 --> 00:11.512
I landed
my fashion dream job
working for her,

00:11.545 --> 00:12.513
Gray Chandler Murray.

00:12.546 --> 00:13.447
The only problem,
they think I'm an adult.

00:13.481 --> 00:16.584
Now I am juggling
two secret lives,

00:16.617 --> 00:19.453
one in high school
and one in high fashion.

00:19.487 --> 00:21.055
Does that mean
you're leaving?

00:21.089 --> 00:22.290
Baseball wants me!

00:22.323 --> 00:25.793
I know I was the one
who wanted distance
and I'm sorry.

00:25.826 --> 00:26.794
If we were
still together

00:26.827 --> 00:29.530
I wouldn't be getting
on this bus right now.

00:29.563 --> 00:30.598
Why do you have a problem
with the sleepovers?

00:30.631 --> 00:32.533
Oh, I don't have
a problem with them.

00:32.566 --> 00:34.568
Because there
won't be anymore.

00:34.602 --> 00:35.803
You're throwing the party
of the century.

00:35.836 --> 00:37.071
Make sure nothing
breaks or burns.

(FABRIC RIPPING)

00:38.606 --> 00:40.474
Unless Jeremy appears,
designs in hand,

00:40.508 --> 00:41.609
Harrods is pulling the plug.

00:41.642 --> 00:42.576
You need to find him
and get him back.

00:42.610 --> 00:44.578
Jane Jane?d go.

00:44.612 --> 00:45.813
Jeremy. Oh.

00:45.846 --> 00:48.616
I was just a puppet.

01:05.899 --> 01:07.835
JANE: Hi, Gray.

01:07.868 --> 01:10.638
Jane! Finally.
Did you locate Jeremy?

01:10.671 --> 01:13.107
Yeah, I was just
talking to him.

01:13.141 --> 01:15.075
Thank God!
Where was he?

01:15.876 --> 01:16.577
Um... In a pub.

01:17.645 --> 01:21.515
And they have great food.

01:21.549 --> 01:23.517
He said no!

01:23.551 --> 01:25.586
No? That's it?
He said no?

01:25.619 --> 01:27.855
Well, the bottom line is
he refuses to help.

01:27.888 --> 01:31.625
Did you emphasize how
important those designs
are to Donovan Decker?

01:31.659 --> 01:34.662
Yeah, that came up.
But I didn't want
to pressure him.

01:34.695 --> 01:35.863
He's my friend.

01:35.896 --> 01:37.898
Exactly.
That's why I sent you.

01:37.931 --> 01:39.667
I thought you sent me
because you trusted me,

01:39.700 --> 01:43.537
because I was
the most qualified.

01:43.571 --> 01:46.540
(SCOFFS) Most qualified?
Jane, grow up.

01:46.574 --> 01:49.543
I sent you all the way
to Europe, first class,

01:49.577 --> 01:50.578
and this is what
you bring me?

01:50.611 --> 01:51.879
I did everything
I could, Gray.

01:51.912 --> 01:54.148
You failed,
and now this company

01:54.182 --> 01:57.885
stands to lose
a multi-million
dollar client.

01:57.918 --> 01:59.620

I'm not here
to ask for anything.

02:28.682 --> 02:30.951
I promise.

02:30.984 --> 02:33.954
Look, I'm not here for Gray
or the designs or any of that.

02:33.987 --> 02:37.725
I have a plane to catch
in a few hours and I just...

02:37.758 --> 02:38.792
I wanted
to say goodbye.

02:38.826 --> 02:41.195
I'm sorry, Jane.
I wish I could help.

I can't.

I donReally?e you.

02:45.233 --> 02:47.201
I felt like
you were upset
with me earlier on.

02:47.235 --> 02:49.937
Well, I was frustrated.

02:49.970 --> 02:51.772
And I got to thinking
about what you said and...

02:53.674 --> 02:54.742
Anyway, I know
what it feels like

02:54.775 --> 02:56.210
to be treated
like a puppet.

02:56.244 --> 02:58.612
Let me guess.
You reported
back to Gray.

02:58.646 --> 02:59.713
Good guess.

03:00.714 --> 03:02.750
She totally used me.

That's our Gray.

03:07.788 --> 03:10.758
Look, I still
think what you did,

03:10.791 --> 03:13.694
giving our secrets to Beau,
that was wrong.

03:14.795 --> 03:16.196
But I forgive you.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.267
You're still my friend.

03:21.669 --> 03:22.703
Well, I should get going.

03:24.805 --> 03:26.206
Take care, Jane.

03:27.775 --> 03:29.277
I'll miss you.

03:41.054 --> 03:43.291
Hold it!

03:48.829 --> 03:50.764
Did you really mean
what you said about
us being friends?

03:50.798 --> 03:52.300
Every word.

03:54.835 --> 03:56.804
Then we better
get the designs.

03:56.837 --> 03:58.672
How much time
do we have?

03:58.706 --> 04:00.274
Uh... We have to be
at Harrods by 5:00.

04:47.888 --> 04:50.758
Well, they seemed
happy to see me.

04:50.791 --> 04:51.859
But what about the designs?

04:51.892 --> 04:53.327

at Okay.now.

any minute.

they like them.

Why do I care?

04:58.766 --> 04:59.867
I don't work for
Donovan Decker anymore.

04:59.900 --> 05:02.336
Well, they were
your designs.

05:02.370 --> 05:04.838
And for what it's worth,
I think they're amazing.

05:17.117 --> 05:18.886

makes you beautiful *

05:48.148 --> 05:50.851
It's nice
to hear you call me
your friend again.

05:50.884 --> 05:52.920
And thank you
for what you said before.

05:52.953 --> 05:55.122
You have a gift.

05:55.155 --> 05:56.957

to see it go to waste.

I got a text to
come straight here.

06:46.474 --> 06:50.844
We all wanted to be here
to greet you.

06:50.878 --> 06:53.013

some major butt
across the pond.

would have been lost.

Thank you.

07:03.957 --> 07:06.226
But it was really
Jeremy's designs
that did it.

07:06.259 --> 07:07.961
That's what I said.

07:07.995 --> 07:09.897
Still, you made it happen.

07:09.930 --> 07:10.798
And I just want it
to be known

07:10.831 --> 07:11.865
that I never doubted
you for a minute.

07:11.899 --> 07:16.870
Yeah, I felt that support
every time we talked.

07:16.904 --> 07:19.907
Now, there's one more
important matter at hand.

07:19.940 --> 07:20.974
What's this?

07:21.008 --> 07:22.976
A well-deserved
bonus check.

07:23.010 --> 07:25.879
Donovan Decker
wanted you to know
how much we appreciate

07:25.913 --> 07:26.980
what you accomplished
in London.

(CHUCKLES)

07:43.864 --> 07:46.967
I'm telling you, Janey.
The party was
out of control sick.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.836
Just totally insane.

Who didnMe.show up?

07:51.972 --> 07:53.140
All right.
That doesn't
matter, all right?

07:53.173 --> 07:56.844
You are now
officially a legend
at Whitemarsh High!

07:56.877 --> 07:57.911
Oh, yeah.

07:57.945 --> 07:59.980
Okay, I told everybody that
you were making out

08:00.013 --> 08:02.049
in a bathroom
with a college dude.

08:02.082 --> 08:03.984
(GASPS) That's brilliant.

08:04.017 --> 08:06.887
So now I am a legend
with mystique!

08:06.920 --> 08:09.022
That is right.
And you are welcome.

08:09.056 --> 08:12.960
Thanks. That'll help
erase the sting
of me not being there.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.062
Of course, this
does not hurt, either.

08:15.095 --> 08:17.064
And what's that?

08:17.097 --> 08:21.902
It's just something
that we in the biz like
to call a job well done.

08:22.102 --> 08:25.873
Oh! $5,000!

08:25.906 --> 08:27.074

If you're rich,
what does that make me?

08:30.010 --> 08:32.279
Best friends
with somebody
who is totally rich.

08:32.312 --> 08:33.080
I think I can take that.

08:33.113 --> 08:35.082
Mmm-hmm.

08:35.115 --> 08:37.951
So, what are you
gonna buy first?

08:37.985 --> 08:39.987
Well, at first I thought
about blowing it all
on purses and shoes

08:40.020 --> 08:43.290
but then I thought,
what could I buy that
could benefit us both.

08:43.323 --> 08:45.058
Okay. I'm liking
where this is going.

08:45.092 --> 08:47.094
Mmm-hmm,
I thought you might.

08:47.127 --> 08:51.098
And so,
tomorrow after school...

08:51.131 --> 08:53.066
I'm gonna make
the down payment
on a new car.

08:53.100 --> 08:55.068

08:55.102 --> 08:58.305
Yes. It is time
to say goodbye
to the Beast.

08:58.338 --> 08:59.106
I'm really proud of you.

08:59.139 --> 08:59.539
Thanks.

09:02.976 --> 09:05.946
Oh, wealth, popularity,

09:05.979 --> 09:07.981
all is finally right
in the world.

09:08.015 --> 09:09.149
(CLEARS THROAT)

09:11.118 --> 09:13.987
That lasted two seconds.
What?

09:14.021 --> 09:15.088
Yeah. You know,
I thought it
would be better

09:15.122 --> 09:18.125
to lead in
with the good stuff,

09:18.158 --> 09:20.093
and then just
save the bad
for the end.

09:20.127 --> 09:21.028
How bad?

09:26.033 --> 09:27.134
(GASPS) The costumes!

09:27.167 --> 09:29.069
Gosh!

09:33.040 --> 09:34.574
Oh! Billy!

09:36.176 --> 09:38.946
What happened?

09:38.979 --> 09:40.347
Unfortunately, there's
a price to be paid

09:40.380 --> 09:43.016
for out of control,
super sick parties.

09:43.050 --> 09:44.284
The school play
opens tomorrow night.

09:44.317 --> 09:48.088
How am I going to
repair all of these
costumes by then?

09:48.121 --> 09:49.156
This could not
get any worse.

09:49.189 --> 09:51.959
(INHALES SHARPLY)

09:51.992 --> 09:55.128

What now?

09:55.162 --> 09:57.097
You've been home alone
for the past two weeks.

09:57.130 --> 09:59.967
Exactly how many
unsupervised parties
have you had?

10:00.000 --> 10:01.368
The other night
was the first.

10:01.401 --> 10:01.869
And the last!
I promise.

10:04.071 --> 10:06.006
What are you doing?

10:06.039 --> 10:08.175
I promised Billy
I'd talk to you first
before calling Ben.

10:08.208 --> 10:10.043
I did. And now
I'm calling him.

10:10.077 --> 10:12.045
Please,
please don't do that.

10:12.079 --> 10:13.013
You've given me
no reason not to.

10:13.046 --> 10:15.048
You're not old enough
to live on your own.

10:15.082 --> 10:17.050
Look, I haven't
really been alone.

10:17.084 --> 10:19.019
I mean, Billy's been
staying with me at night.

10:19.052 --> 10:21.121
Okay, not making me
feel any better.

10:21.154 --> 10:27.094
I just didn't want Ben
to miss out on his
dream, again,

10:27.127 --> 10:29.029
because of me.

10:29.062 --> 10:31.164
I couldn't live with that
hanging over my head.

10:31.198 --> 10:33.100
I realize that, but...

10:35.102 --> 10:38.405
He's a professional
baseball player now.

10:38.438 --> 10:40.107
I mean, do you really want
to ruin that for him?

10:47.114 --> 10:48.115
(SIGHS)

10:49.249 --> 10:51.218
Thank you, Miss Shaw.

10:51.251 --> 10:53.186
Don't get too excited.

10:53.220 --> 10:55.155
Until we figure
something out,
I'm moving in with you.

10:57.257 --> 11:00.060
I forget.
What's the next
part again?

11:00.093 --> 11:02.129
Prince Charming
takes your hand
and says,

11:02.162 --> 11:03.063
"Will you have
this dance with me?"

11:03.096 --> 11:06.066
And you say,
"It would
be my honor."

11:06.099 --> 11:07.000
You're not even
looking at the script

11:07.034 --> 11:09.236
and you know the lines
better than I do.

11:09.269 --> 11:13.173
Yeah, well, I've been
keeping a close eye
on your rehearsals.

11:13.206 --> 11:14.374
You're not getting weird
about Nick and me again,
are you?

11:14.407 --> 11:18.145
Eh, it's not my favorite thing
watching you two onstage,

11:18.178 --> 11:21.114
gazing into
each other's eyes.

11:21.148 --> 11:24.051
But I'm feeling pretty
good about us right now.

11:24.084 --> 11:24.151
Me, too.

11:32.292 --> 11:35.128
As much as I hate
to admit it,
killer party, Jane!

11:35.162 --> 11:36.163
Thanks!

11:44.237 --> 11:46.139
Have you talked to her
since she got back?

11:46.173 --> 11:48.075
No.

11:48.108 --> 11:48.942
I've just been
keeping my distance.

11:48.976 --> 11:52.279
Come on, Zoe.
This is important to me.

11:52.312 --> 11:54.247
Okay? I want you and Jane
to be friends.

11:54.281 --> 11:57.250
It's not just me, Billy.

11:57.284 --> 12:00.253
I get the feeling
that Jane doesn't
like me very much.

12:01.188 --> 12:02.189
I'll see you at lunch.

12:10.163 --> 12:13.100
Hey, Janey.
How's it going?

12:13.133 --> 12:15.268
Don't ask.
I have a test
in 10 minutes.

12:15.302 --> 12:16.136
And I still have to
finish all the costumes
by tonight,

12:16.169 --> 12:20.107
which I have no idea
how I'm going to do.

12:20.140 --> 12:22.109
And on top of that,
Miss Shaw just announced
she's moving in with me.

12:22.142 --> 12:26.246
Ooh! Living with
the guidance counselor?
That is rough.

12:26.279 --> 12:28.315
Yeah. It's hard to go back
once you've had
a taste of freedom.

12:28.348 --> 12:30.317
(CHUCKLES) Sorry.

12:30.350 --> 12:32.219
You know, we tried to throw
Miss Shaw off the scent,

12:32.252 --> 12:34.321
but Zoe was
just not trained
for Code Red.

12:34.354 --> 12:36.323
You did your best.

12:36.356 --> 12:38.291
All right, well,
I'll see you later.

12:40.360 --> 12:41.228
Hey, Billy?

12:43.263 --> 12:44.331
Uh, what was
Zoe doing there?

12:44.364 --> 12:46.333
Where?

12:46.366 --> 12:49.202
At my house.

12:49.236 --> 12:52.139
You just said she was there
when Miss Shaw showed up
in the morning and...

12:52.172 --> 12:53.340
Did she spend the night?

12:53.373 --> 12:58.211
Yeah, yeah. She just
crashed on the couch.

12:58.245 --> 13:01.314
That's it?
Nothing else?

13:01.348 --> 13:04.251
Wait, so you told her
nothing happened?

13:04.284 --> 13:05.252
Yeah.

13:05.285 --> 13:06.219
So you lied to her.

13:06.253 --> 13:10.190
It wasn't a lie,
technically.

13:10.223 --> 13:11.158
But something
did happen, right?

13:11.191 --> 13:13.226
So, what's the technicality?

13:13.260 --> 13:17.330
Well, Jane asked
about the night
of the party.

13:17.364 --> 13:20.333
And Zoe and I hooked up
after midnight, the next day.

13:20.367 --> 13:23.336
Dude, that would
so not hold up in court.

13:23.370 --> 13:28.241
Okay, so I wasn't
completely honest.

13:28.275 --> 13:29.242
But, why do I
have to tell her?

13:29.276 --> 13:30.210
It's not anyone's
business.

13:30.243 --> 13:32.245
Why are you telling me?

13:32.279 --> 13:34.281
I don't know.
Because we're friends.

13:34.314 --> 13:37.284
Right. But isn't Jane
supposed to be your friend?

13:37.317 --> 13:40.187
Your best friend,
in fact.

13:40.220 --> 13:42.289
You ever wonder why you
can't tell her the truth
about stuff like that?

13:50.630 --> 13:53.200
Oh. India, hi.

13:53.233 --> 13:54.234
Eli.

13:56.236 --> 13:58.271
Look, about
the otDon't.ght...

13:58.305 --> 13:59.406
I said don't.

13:59.439 --> 14:03.210
What happened
was a tragic mistake.

14:03.243 --> 14:05.245
I totally agree.

14:05.278 --> 14:08.348
Good. Are we done?

14:08.381 --> 14:10.383
Yeah. I just wanted
to make sure

14:10.417 --> 14:12.285
that, you know,
things were cool and
that you're okay.

14:12.319 --> 14:14.287
(CHUCKLES) Hold it.

14:14.321 --> 14:17.424
Did you think that
I might actually
have feelings for you?

14:17.457 --> 14:19.426
Oh, my God, you did.

14:19.459 --> 14:21.294
How sad.

14:21.328 --> 14:23.330
Um, rest assured,
Eli, that I'm fine.

14:23.363 --> 14:25.398
Truth is, you're
just not my type.

14:25.432 --> 14:28.335
Good. Because
I'm just starting
things with Jane.

14:28.368 --> 14:29.436
Yeah.

14:29.469 --> 14:33.306
And I don't need
any complications.

14:33.340 --> 14:35.342
Really? Then why
did you sleep with me?

14:35.375 --> 14:38.411
Geez, and you wonder
why everybody thinks
you're so cold.

14:38.445 --> 14:41.348
I can see why Jeremy took
the first flight to London.

14:42.682 --> 14:44.451
That was over the line.

14:44.484 --> 14:47.287
Don't worry.
I'm a big girl.

14:48.355 --> 14:51.324
And I accept
your apology.

14:51.358 --> 14:53.260
So when are you
going to tell Jane?

14:53.293 --> 14:54.261
Tell her what?

14:54.294 --> 14:55.328
About you and me.

14:55.362 --> 14:56.229
You know,
clothes flying off,
legs in the air.

14:56.263 --> 14:59.332
Jane and I have only
been on one date.

14:59.366 --> 15:00.400
We're not really
in a relationship.

15:00.433 --> 15:03.336
So, I think
it would just
hurt her feelings.

15:03.370 --> 15:06.506
Okay. I just thought
it might be easier
coming from you.

15:08.708 --> 15:11.311
I think it would crush her
if she heard it
from someone else.

15:16.483 --> 15:17.284
Awesome party.

15:17.317 --> 15:18.385
Thanks, guys.

15:22.422 --> 15:26.293
Hey, Ben..

15:26.326 --> 15:28.361
Yeah. Just for
a couple of days.

15:28.395 --> 15:29.429
Thought I'd surprise you.

15:29.462 --> 15:31.298
That iIs it?reat.

15:31.331 --> 15:31.564
I was just at home.

15:31.598 --> 15:34.301
Oh?

15:34.334 --> 15:35.368
Where's Mom?

15:36.536 --> 15:37.537
Uh...

15:43.243 --> 15:46.313
Wow. She couldn't
even last two weeks.

15:46.346 --> 15:49.116
That's a record,
even for Mom.

15:49.149 --> 15:53.253
Don't be mad at Mom, okay?
She left before you did.

15:53.286 --> 15:55.322
She didn't know what
was going on either.

15:55.355 --> 15:59.126
Oh, so, I should
only be mad at you?

15:59.159 --> 16:04.131
Must we assign blame?
Can't we just accept
what is and move on?

16:04.164 --> 16:05.332
Jane.

16:05.365 --> 16:07.200
I thought I was doing
the right thing.

16:07.234 --> 16:09.202
Mom went to be
with Dakota,

16:09.236 --> 16:13.206
and I didn't want to
stop you from playing
baseball again, Ben.

16:13.240 --> 16:15.208
Well, that is
all very nice.

16:15.242 --> 16:17.344
I obviously can't
leave you alone.

16:17.377 --> 16:19.246
Well, you don't have to.

16:19.279 --> 16:19.979
Rita offered
to stay with me
at the house

16:20.013 --> 16:22.149
until we figure
something out.

16:22.182 --> 16:23.116
Really?

16:23.150 --> 16:26.153
She wants you to live
your dream too, Ben.

16:26.186 --> 16:28.188
And, by the way,
she said she misses you.

16:28.221 --> 16:30.157
She Yeah.that?

16:30.190 --> 16:31.224
You should talk to her.

16:33.193 --> 16:34.294
Great party, Jane!

16:36.363 --> 16:39.366
Like I said,
she really misses you.
So, go to her. Bye.

16:39.399 --> 16:41.334
(CELL Party?RINGS)

16:43.403 --> 16:45.305
Hello?

16:45.338 --> 16:47.274
CARTER: Hey, Jane,
it's Carter. I need a favor.

16:47.307 --> 16:49.276
Carter! My life is
sort of collapsing
around me right now.

16:49.309 --> 16:51.178
So if you value
our friendship at all,

16:51.211 --> 16:52.245
you will call
somebody else.

16:52.279 --> 16:53.813
Look, Jane,
I screwed up.

16:53.846 --> 16:54.914
Every year, Donovan Decker
donates an obscene amount
of money to charities.

16:54.947 --> 16:58.251
And he forces Gray
to go to some
of their events.

16:58.285 --> 16:59.352
She hates it.

16:59.386 --> 17:01.388
Like you had
to tell me that.

17:01.421 --> 17:04.291
There's one for tonight.
The invitation is being
sent over this afternoon.

17:04.324 --> 17:05.292
Tonight?
Like, zero notice tonight?

17:05.325 --> 17:08.328
Exactly. Will you
tell her it's coming?

17:08.361 --> 17:10.330
Me?

17:10.363 --> 17:12.265
Bad news will
go down smoother
coming from you.

17:12.299 --> 17:15.202
You're the golden girl
who saved the company.

17:15.235 --> 17:18.238
I knew that was
gonna bite me
in the ass someday.

17:18.271 --> 17:20.407
You said you could
fix that light board.

17:20.440 --> 17:23.210
And you call
yourself a geek?

17:23.243 --> 17:24.244
Leave me. Go.

17:28.248 --> 17:31.251
Miss Clark.
You got a sec?

17:31.284 --> 17:34.254
Uh, make it quick, Jane.
I'm kind of in a bind here.

17:34.287 --> 17:36.356
I kind of have
some bad news
about the costumes.

17:36.389 --> 17:38.258
Well, I can't take any more
bad news right now,

17:38.291 --> 17:40.393
so whatever it is,
just put a positive
spin on it.

17:40.427 --> 17:42.329
Okay.

17:42.362 --> 17:44.231
Some of the costumes
are ruined.

17:44.264 --> 17:46.233
How is that
a positive spin?

17:46.266 --> 17:48.335
Because all of the
costumes are ruined.

17:48.368 --> 17:49.202
What?

17:49.236 --> 17:50.036
It's okay. There's
no need to panic.

17:50.069 --> 17:52.272
With a little money
for material,

17:52.305 --> 17:53.406
I can get them
all fixed in time.

17:53.440 --> 17:55.442
Oh! Oh, no problem.

17:55.475 --> 17:57.444
I'll just run out
to the ATM and grab
you some extra cash.

17:57.477 --> 17:58.378
How much do you need?

17:58.411 --> 18:00.247
Oh, well,
it's probably
just like...

18:00.280 --> 18:02.382
Jane, there's
no extra cash.

18:02.415 --> 18:05.285
Well, doesn't the school
have, like, an emergency
fund or something?

18:05.318 --> 18:08.388
(SCOFFS) Only if it
involves a football.
Never for the arts.

18:08.421 --> 18:10.290
And we just found out
the entire light board
is burned out.

18:10.323 --> 18:13.260
So I'm gonna
have to pay
a fortune to fix it.

18:13.293 --> 18:14.394
Maybe we can
do a fundraiser.

18:14.427 --> 18:16.296
Like a car wash
or something.

18:16.329 --> 18:20.467
Do you think we can
wash 3,000 cars
by 6:00 tonight?

18:20.500 --> 18:22.269
I meant
maybe we could...

18:22.302 --> 18:24.304
Okay, forget it.
Jane, it's over.

18:24.337 --> 18:25.538
What do you mean,
it's over?

18:25.572 --> 18:28.308
I mean, I can't
have a play without
costumes or lights.

18:28.341 --> 18:31.411
So I'm just gonna
have to cancel
the whole thing.

18:31.444 --> 18:31.511
(SIGHS)

18:38.418 --> 18:39.519
You wanted to see me?

18:39.552 --> 18:40.353
Please sit down.

18:46.393 --> 18:48.528
No.

18:48.561 --> 18:52.365
India, I realize we've
had our differences
this past year,

18:52.399 --> 18:56.303
and through the recent chaos
and Jeremy's disappearance,

18:56.336 --> 18:57.537
it's become
crystal clear

18:57.570 --> 19:00.340
that Donovan Decker
is just not the same
since you left.

19:00.373 --> 19:04.344
I didn't leave.
I was fired.

19:04.377 --> 19:06.479
A mistake.
A rare mistake
on my part.

19:07.347 --> 19:09.316
And?

19:09.349 --> 19:10.417
And you're very gifted.

19:11.451 --> 19:13.386
We...

19:13.420 --> 19:18.358
I hope you'll consider
coming back and being
part of the team.

19:18.391 --> 19:20.360
But this time
as lead designer.

19:22.362 --> 19:26.333
(CHUCKLES) You're serious?

19:26.366 --> 19:28.535
I would be very pleased
if you would say yes.

19:32.505 --> 19:35.342
Okay. I accept.

19:35.375 --> 19:36.509
But under one condition.

19:38.511 --> 19:41.348
I want to handpick
my own team.

19:41.381 --> 19:48.388
Deal?

19:48.421 --> 19:48.455
Deal.

19:55.495 --> 19:57.497
I'm sad the play
got canceled.

19:57.530 --> 20:00.500
Why? It's been
totally lame
since Lulu quit.

20:00.533 --> 20:04.504
And let's face it,
it would've sucked
unless I was Cindy.

20:05.505 --> 20:06.606
I can hear you.

20:07.574 --> 20:09.409
Oh. Good.

20:17.450 --> 20:18.585
I'm gonna go get
my stuff, okay?

20:18.618 --> 20:20.420
Yeah, I'll catch up
with you later.

20:27.460 --> 20:30.530
I went from being
the most popular
girl in school

20:30.563 --> 20:32.499
to the most hated
by lunch.

20:32.532 --> 20:35.535
(SCOFFS) Whatever.
Ignore them. It wasn't
your fault, Jane.

20:35.568 --> 20:40.407
Not all of it.
But the costumes
were my responsibility.

20:40.440 --> 20:43.543
My beautiful glass slippers
that I've been bedazzling
for weeks.

20:43.576 --> 20:45.612
They'll never be worn.

20:45.645 --> 20:48.415
Not necessarily.

20:48.448 --> 20:49.482
What are you doing?

20:49.516 --> 20:50.650
Just go with it.

20:53.686 --> 20:55.488
Perfect fit.

21:01.494 --> 21:05.432
So, um, how are
you holding up
with all this?

21:05.465 --> 21:06.633
The truth?
Pretty bummed.

21:06.666 --> 21:08.568
You know, I was
having a good time.

21:08.601 --> 21:09.602
I know.
I could tell.

21:11.471 --> 21:13.573
Yeah. Look, I know
it sounds lame, Janey,

21:13.606 --> 21:15.608
but for the first time
here at Whitemarsh,

21:15.642 --> 21:18.545
I actually felt like
I was a part of something,
you know?

21:18.578 --> 21:19.479
Like I belonged.

21:19.512 --> 21:22.649
The drama club is
where the misfits go.

21:22.682 --> 21:24.484
(LAUGHS) I guess
we should've
joined up a while ago.

21:26.653 --> 21:28.588
Don't worry.
There'll be more plays.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.523
That's not what I heard.

21:30.557 --> 21:31.591
Miss Clark said if it
all went well tonight,

21:31.624 --> 21:33.460
we might've
gotten a budget
to do more shows.

21:33.493 --> 21:36.529
But now? Who knows.

21:57.517 --> 21:57.550
(SIGHS)

21:59.652 --> 22:01.521
Goodbye,
pretty new car.

22:06.759 --> 22:08.728
Miss Clark?

22:08.761 --> 22:11.498
What now, Jane?

22:11.531 --> 22:12.499
Want to have a cookie drive,
rebuild the science wing?

22:12.532 --> 22:15.502
Um, actually...

22:15.535 --> 22:16.669
What's this?

22:18.638 --> 22:21.708
$5,000?

22:21.741 --> 22:23.576
I can't accept this.
You're a minor.

22:23.610 --> 22:25.612
It's against
school policy.

22:25.645 --> 22:26.713
Damn it, why is
everyone here a minor?

22:26.746 --> 22:29.682
Oh, it's not from me.

22:30.683 --> 22:31.684
Who is it from?

22:31.718 --> 22:34.587
It's from Donovan Decker.

22:34.621 --> 22:38.625
I have an internship there.
He's, like, really into
charity for the arts.

22:38.658 --> 22:41.528
Ah! Oh, my God!
Well, this will
cover everything.

22:41.561 --> 22:42.562
They didn't know
who to make it out to,

22:42.595 --> 22:43.596
so they just
made it out to me.

22:43.630 --> 22:45.698
But I already endorsed it.
So, it's all yours.

22:48.801 --> 22:51.571
Okay, let go.

22:51.604 --> 22:56.543
(WHISPERS) Okay.

22:56.576 --> 22:56.609
(SIGHS)

23:04.784 --> 23:06.719
What's all this?

23:06.753 --> 23:07.754
God, I hope
this is not
what's trending now.

23:07.787 --> 23:08.721
No, these are
costumes for my...

23:08.755 --> 23:12.692
A theater production
that I am involved with

23:12.725 --> 23:14.661
and I have
to repair them
by tonight.

23:14.694 --> 23:15.695
I don't know, Jane.
This looks like
a whole lot of work.

23:15.728 --> 23:17.797
(SIGHS)
Tell me about it.

23:17.830 --> 23:18.865
You need some help?

23:18.898 --> 23:20.667
God, yes.
I'd love some.

23:20.700 --> 23:22.702
I don't think
I can do this
all on my own.

23:22.735 --> 23:24.704
Um, actually,
I'm kind of busy, so...

23:24.737 --> 23:26.706
Oh, really, Carter?
Because I believe
that I just told Gray

23:26.739 --> 23:28.841
about a charity event
that she has
to go to tonight.

23:28.875 --> 23:30.677
She almost
bit my head off.

23:30.710 --> 23:31.110
So, you owe me.

23:31.143 --> 23:34.681
All right, fine.

23:34.714 --> 23:35.782
What happened to that
sweet little girl
I used to know?

23:35.815 --> 23:36.683
I miss her.

23:36.716 --> 23:38.751
I'm still here.

23:38.885 --> 23:40.887
(CHUCKLES)

23:45.725 --> 23:45.758
Hey.

23:46.893 --> 23:48.828
Ben! Hi.

23:48.861 --> 23:50.697
Uh, I heard
you were back.

23:50.730 --> 23:52.732
Have you talked to Jane?

23:52.765 --> 23:55.768
Yeah. I'm up to speed.

23:55.802 --> 23:58.871
And, uh, it means a lot
that you would offer
to stay with her.

23:58.905 --> 24:01.741
It really does.
But I can't
let you do that.

24:01.774 --> 24:03.743
It's totally cool.
I don't mind.

24:03.776 --> 24:06.846
I know.
But it's not necessary.

24:06.879 --> 24:08.781
I'm not going
back to the team.

24:11.851 --> 24:12.885
Ben, this is what
you've always wanted to do.

24:12.919 --> 24:15.788
It was.

24:15.822 --> 24:19.892
And I can't deny
that it's been
pretty awesome.

24:19.926 --> 24:20.893
For a while.

24:23.830 --> 24:26.933
And I realized
this was my dream
six years ago.

24:28.801 --> 24:30.770
My life has changed.
For the better.

24:30.803 --> 24:33.906
I have a job that I love.

24:33.940 --> 24:35.742
I have Jane.

24:35.775 --> 24:37.810
And I have you.

24:39.846 --> 24:41.748
At least I want to.

24:41.781 --> 24:44.817
We can go as slow
as you want.

24:44.851 --> 24:48.921
And if you don't want
anyone in the world
to know about us,

24:48.955 --> 24:50.790
I'm okay with that.

24:50.823 --> 24:52.959
We can keep it
a secret. I just...

24:54.861 --> 24:55.928
I want you back.

24:55.962 --> 24:55.995
Rita, I...

24:58.998 --> 25:01.901
I just want you back.

25:02.001 --> 25:04.837
So, think about it.

25:16.849 --> 25:17.884
Um, excuse me. Hi.

25:17.917 --> 25:21.954
Um, I have
an invitation
for Donovan Decker.

25:21.988 --> 25:23.956
He made a very
charitable donation
to our school.

25:23.990 --> 25:25.892
Right. We were
expecting this.

25:25.925 --> 25:27.960
Really?
It's for tonight.

25:27.994 --> 25:30.029
Yes. I'll make sure
it gets in the right hands.

25:30.062 --> 25:31.864
Okay, great.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.034
Hmm.

25:41.874 --> 25:43.976
So, bottom of the 9th.
Two outs.
We're up by one.

25:44.010 --> 25:46.946
I'm in the zone.
I'm un-hittable.

25:46.979 --> 25:49.849
Except for the seven hits
I'd given up earlier.

25:49.882 --> 25:50.717
When they call in
a pinch hitter.

25:50.750 --> 25:53.019
And guess who
comes up to the plate?

25:53.052 --> 25:55.855
Albert Pujols.

25:55.888 --> 25:58.825
Wait, did you
strike out
Albert Pujols?

25:58.858 --> 26:00.026
No, I did not.
He hit it.

26:00.059 --> 26:04.030
Far. Very, very far.

26:04.063 --> 26:06.933
In fact, he launched
that ball into the
atmosphere so hard

26:06.966 --> 26:09.001
that I don't think
it has landed yet.

26:09.035 --> 26:10.837
Sorry, Coach.

26:10.870 --> 26:11.904
Are you kidding?
It was beautiful.

26:29.889 --> 26:31.924
Hey, Miss Shaw.

26:32.925 --> 26:35.962
Can I do something
for you?

26:35.995 --> 26:37.063
Yes, you can.

26:49.041 --> 26:49.809
That was very public.

26:49.842 --> 26:53.145
Yes. I'm all yours,
Ben Quimby.

26:54.046 --> 26:57.083
And from now on,
you can call me Rita.

27:18.037 --> 27:19.005
Here. Done.

27:19.038 --> 27:22.074
I added a pocket
to cover the
guacamole stain.

27:22.108 --> 27:24.043
ThankMmm-hmm.rter.

27:24.076 --> 27:27.113
And in case you weren't sure,
we're now officially even.

27:30.116 --> 27:32.051
Well, what do you think?

27:32.985 --> 27:33.953
It's gorgeous.

27:33.986 --> 27:36.088
I can't believe
we did it.

27:36.122 --> 27:39.091
And with an hour
to spare.

27:39.125 --> 27:39.926
Talk about cutting it
down to the wire, huh?

27:39.959 --> 27:43.195
Thank you, Eli.
You're a life saver.

27:44.163 --> 27:44.797
Any time.

27:44.831 --> 27:47.967
Well, I better
get going.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.969
I got to get
all of this stuff
over to the theater.

27:50.002 --> 27:50.970
You know,
I'm free tonight.

27:51.003 --> 27:54.006
Maybe I could
come with you
to the show.

27:54.040 --> 27:56.108
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)
Well...

27:56.142 --> 27:59.178
Okay. I get it.

28:01.147 --> 28:04.150
Don't be mad, Eli.
We can hang out
another time.

28:06.152 --> 28:07.019
I got to
tell you something.

28:07.153 --> 28:10.156
Okay.

28:10.189 --> 28:12.124
I kind of slept
with someone else.

28:13.993 --> 28:16.162
Kind of or you did?

28:17.163 --> 28:19.131
I did.

28:20.166 --> 28:22.969
Uh, who?

28:23.002 --> 28:24.036
Does it matter?

28:26.138 --> 28:27.139
No.

28:27.173 --> 28:28.174
I'm sorry.

28:34.180 --> 28:36.983
You don't have
to apologize.

28:37.016 --> 28:40.019
It's not like we're
boyfriend and girlfriend
or anything. I just...

28:40.052 --> 28:44.190
I don't know
why you felt the need
to tell me that.

28:44.223 --> 28:46.993
If things are gonna
keep moving forward
with us,

28:47.026 --> 28:50.029
then I want everything
to be out in the open.

28:50.062 --> 28:51.163
I want us
to be closer.

28:53.132 --> 28:55.201
So the way you get
closer to a girl

28:55.234 --> 28:58.070
is by sleeping
with somebody else?

28:58.104 --> 29:00.072
(CHUCKLES) That's an
interesting strategy.

29:01.040 --> 29:02.141
Okay, yes.

29:04.076 --> 29:06.112
I didn't exactly
think it through,

29:06.145 --> 29:08.114
and I really,
really regret it.

29:08.147 --> 29:09.181
But I've got to be
honest with you, Jane.

29:09.215 --> 29:11.183
I've been frustrated
with you.

29:11.217 --> 29:13.185
So this is my fault?

29:13.219 --> 29:14.653
Oh, come on.
You didn't want me
at the party,

29:14.686 --> 29:17.223
and you obviously
don't want me at this play,
or meeting your friends.

29:17.256 --> 29:21.093
I feel like
I don't know you
outside of this office.

29:21.127 --> 29:24.030
It's like you've got
a wall up or you're
hiding something.

29:24.063 --> 29:25.231
You know what, Eli?

29:28.267 --> 29:30.102
You're right.

29:30.302 --> 29:33.239
I am?

29:33.272 --> 29:36.275
The truth is
I have been keeping
things from you.

29:38.110 --> 29:40.212
Tell me,

29:40.246 --> 29:42.281
is there anybody out there
that knows the real
Jane Quimby?

29:45.284 --> 29:46.285
There is one person.

29:46.318 --> 29:48.120
Let me guess.

29:50.289 --> 29:52.124
The complicated
best friend?

29:55.194 --> 29:58.197
Well, sounds like
you should be with him.

30:18.384 --> 30:19.418
(CHUCKLES)

30:22.321 --> 30:23.389
Hey, Janey!

30:23.422 --> 30:24.056
I heard you finished
the costumes.

30:24.090 --> 30:27.226
How did you
manage that?

30:27.259 --> 30:30.329
Oh, well, it doesn't hurt
to work at a place where
everybody knows how to sew.

30:31.263 --> 30:37.403
Yeah.

30:37.436 --> 30:38.370
What's on your mind?

30:38.470 --> 30:42.241
Nothing.

30:42.274 --> 30:44.376
Jane, come on.
Something's up.

30:46.245 --> 30:46.312
I know you.

30:49.348 --> 30:50.282
Better than anyone.

30:53.252 --> 30:53.319
So, let's have it.

30:56.255 --> 30:56.288
Okay, so...

30:58.457 --> 31:00.392
There is something
sort of important

31:00.426 --> 31:01.360
that I want to
talk to you about.

31:03.662 --> 31:07.299
Um, but I'll wait
till you come down.

31:07.333 --> 31:10.302
I've got, like, 100 more
leaves to finish gluing here.

31:10.336 --> 31:13.339
So, go ahead.
We can talk now.

31:13.372 --> 31:15.307
Hey, Billy?
Will you help me run
lines one more time?

31:15.341 --> 31:17.276
Yeah, in a sec, Zoe.

31:18.277 --> 31:18.310
What is it, Jane?

31:26.418 --> 31:27.419
Break a leg tonight.

31:34.460 --> 31:37.496
Ernie? Let me know
when you get the
spotlights finished.

31:38.397 --> 31:39.431
Okay.

31:39.465 --> 31:41.367
And when I come
out for my bow,

31:41.400 --> 31:43.435
can you slip in
a soft pink gel?

31:43.469 --> 31:46.438
Why are you taking a bow?
You're not in the show.

31:46.472 --> 31:48.474
Oh, just do it!

31:50.409 --> 31:51.477
That should
be me up there.

31:51.510 --> 31:54.346
That's what
you keep saying.

31:54.380 --> 31:55.481
You didn't
get the lead.
Let it go.

31:55.514 --> 31:57.483
There's nothing
you can do about it.

31:57.516 --> 31:59.418
Oh, no?

31:59.451 --> 32:01.287
Have you ever
seen the movie,
Showgirls?

32:01.320 --> 32:02.821
Of course.

32:02.854 --> 32:06.292
Some people call it a movie
about the dirty underbelly
of show business.

32:06.325 --> 32:07.393
I call it a classic
instructional video.

32:07.426 --> 32:09.361
What are you
going to do?

32:09.395 --> 32:11.363
Do you remember the part
where the understudy
throws the beads

32:11.397 --> 32:14.433
and the lead
breaks her leg?

32:14.466 --> 32:16.302
You're not serious?

32:16.335 --> 32:17.503
Maybe. Maybe not.

32:17.536 --> 32:19.405
GivLet go!ose.

32:21.507 --> 32:22.474
NICK: Have we met?

32:22.508 --> 32:24.343
Once before.

32:24.376 --> 32:25.411
NICK: When?

32:25.444 --> 32:27.379
No, wait....

32:28.347 --> 32:29.381
(GRUNTS)

32:31.550 --> 32:34.353
Nick! What happened?

32:34.386 --> 32:36.355
I slipped on something.

32:38.357 --> 32:40.459
Why are there beads?

32:41.560 --> 32:43.529
What? What's going on?

32:43.562 --> 32:44.963
Nick fell.

32:46.398 --> 32:48.400
(GROANING)
I can't stand on it.

32:48.434 --> 32:52.338
Oh... You have to.
Because the curtain
goes up in two hours.

32:52.371 --> 32:53.739
So, try again.

32:53.772 --> 32:54.906
I can't. I think
it's sprained.

32:54.940 --> 32:57.509
Look, I'm sorry.
But I think I need
to see the nurse.

33:03.382 --> 33:05.584
Well, how are we going
to do this show
without a Prince Charming?

33:13.459 --> 33:15.361
Oh, I look
like an idiot!

33:15.394 --> 33:16.428
Thanks a lot.

33:16.462 --> 33:22.534
No, not the costume, Jane.
The costume is great.

33:22.568 --> 33:26.572
It's just...
I can't go out there.
I just... I can't do it.

33:26.605 --> 33:31.443
Stop worrying.
You have got this.

33:31.477 --> 33:35.447
Not only do you know
all of the lines,
but you...

33:35.481 --> 33:37.449
You are the perfect
Prince Charming.

33:37.483 --> 33:40.586
(SCOFFS) If I'm so perfect,
then why do you have to
keep taking in my pants?

33:40.619 --> 33:43.589
(LAUGHS)

33:43.622 --> 33:48.560
(SIGHS) So, what was
that whole "break a leg"
thing about earlier?

33:48.594 --> 33:49.495
Oh. Um...

33:51.597 --> 33:54.466
I was just wishing
everybody luck.

33:54.500 --> 33:56.502
Mmm, come on.
There's something
on your mind.

33:58.604 --> 34:00.406
And I think
I know what it is.

34:00.439 --> 34:03.475
No, I seriously
doubt it.

34:03.509 --> 34:05.644
So, this isn't
about me and Zoe?

34:07.646 --> 34:10.048
Um, what about
you and Zoe?

34:11.550 --> 34:14.586
I wasn't completely
honest earlier.

34:14.620 --> 34:20.492
I don't know
why I didn't
just say it before,

34:20.526 --> 34:22.528
but after the party,
Zoe and I spent
the night together.

34:22.561 --> 34:25.631
Yeah, you told me.
She crashed
on the couch.

34:25.664 --> 34:28.567
Actually, she didn't.

34:30.636 --> 34:34.473
Things have gotten
pretty serious, Jane.

34:34.506 --> 34:35.674
Serious? What is that
supposed to mean?

34:40.546 --> 34:42.614
Oh.

34:42.648 --> 34:46.652
Yeah, it just happened,
and I should've said
something before, but...

34:48.554 --> 34:50.522
Anyways. (SIGHS)

34:50.556 --> 34:54.526
I really
like her, Janey.

34:54.560 --> 34:56.662
That's good, Billy.
I'm happy for you.

34:57.663 --> 34:58.664
Thanks.

35:02.634 --> 35:05.471
Well, you are all ready,
Prince Charming.

35:05.504 --> 35:08.507
(SIGHS) Well, I can't believe
I'm going to do this.

35:08.540 --> 35:09.208
(EXCLAIMS EXCITEDLY)

35:09.241 --> 35:11.477
I hope nothing
goes wrong.

35:11.510 --> 35:13.512
Everything that could
go wrong already has.

35:13.545 --> 35:16.515
Trust me, tonight
is gonna be great.

35:16.548 --> 35:17.716
Nothing can ruin it.

35:24.723 --> 35:27.693
(SIGHS) Thanks
for coming with me.

35:27.726 --> 35:30.662
I couldn't
have suffered
through this alone.

35:30.696 --> 35:31.697
Hmm.

35:41.207 --> 35:43.209
I'm sorry, Ana.
I just don't think

35:43.242 --> 35:45.344
things are going
to work out
between us.

35:45.377 --> 35:49.248
Seriously? Just because
my foot won't fit
in that ugly slipper?

35:50.449 --> 35:51.383
What's wrong?

35:51.417 --> 35:55.187
Uh... Nothing.

35:55.221 --> 35:58.324
I just, um...
Just noticing
the costumes.

35:58.357 --> 36:01.360
GRAY: Tell me about it.
This play is a bore.

36:01.393 --> 36:04.196
Even for high school.

36:04.230 --> 36:07.366
But those costumes,
they're amazing.

36:07.399 --> 36:09.301
I wonder who did them.

36:10.436 --> 36:12.371
Yeah.

36:12.404 --> 36:15.407
I disagree.
You're good-looking,
I'm super good-looking,

36:15.441 --> 36:17.343
so that means,
as a couple,

36:17.376 --> 36:19.211
we'd be slightly
less good-looking
than I am,

36:19.245 --> 36:22.214
which is still
way above average.
What do you say?

36:22.248 --> 36:22.281
Uh...

36:25.251 --> 36:28.220
Congratulations, Amanda.

36:28.254 --> 36:29.288
You're right.
It is amazing.

36:31.290 --> 36:32.391
I didn't say...

36:33.259 --> 36:35.227
Yes. It is...

36:35.261 --> 36:37.396
Shh! It's magical.
I know. I feel it, too.

36:39.265 --> 36:41.400
Okay, I'm gonna
go watch from
the audience.

36:42.301 --> 36:45.404
Oh, Rita.
I'm glad you came.

36:46.472 --> 36:48.440
And congratulations
on your victory.

36:49.408 --> 36:51.243
Victory?

36:51.277 --> 36:52.378
Ben. It was
a well-fought battle.

36:52.411 --> 36:55.247
I hope there are
no hard feelings.

36:55.281 --> 36:56.348
Just a little healthy
competition, right?

36:59.418 --> 37:01.453
It was never
a competition, Amanda.

37:06.292 --> 37:07.459
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

37:13.432 --> 37:17.436
Nice try.
But you can't ignore
me anymore, Jeremy.

37:24.310 --> 37:26.478
JEREMY: What kind of team?

37:26.512 --> 37:28.514
At Donovan Decker.

37:28.547 --> 37:31.417
Gray wants me back.

37:31.450 --> 37:34.386
And I want you
to come with me.

37:34.420 --> 37:37.356
Think about it, Jeremy.
We can finally
take her down together.

37:37.389 --> 37:38.490
Let it go, India.

37:38.524 --> 37:40.392
What?

37:40.426 --> 37:42.461
This whole "vendetta
against Gray" thing.

37:43.429 --> 37:46.332
I can't let it go.

37:46.365 --> 37:49.435
She discarded me
like I never
mattered to her.

37:49.468 --> 37:51.370
Do you really think
if you didn't matter
to Gray,

37:51.403 --> 37:53.339
she would ask you
to come back?

37:53.505 --> 37:55.341
She needs you.

37:56.408 --> 37:57.443
And you.

37:57.476 --> 37:58.577
No. No, no, no.

38:00.346 --> 38:03.382
I'm done with all that.

38:03.415 --> 38:05.451
Two days ago,
I didn't know what I was
gonna do with my life.

38:05.484 --> 38:07.419
And then Jane came,

38:07.453 --> 38:10.456
and I realized
that I still have
a lot to offer.

38:10.489 --> 38:12.458
But I have to do it
my own way this time.

38:12.491 --> 38:14.360
What does that mean?

38:14.393 --> 38:15.427
I'm moving back
to New York.

38:17.396 --> 38:19.331
I'm gonna start
my own label.

38:19.365 --> 38:21.333
It won't be easy.
I'll be starting
from the ground up,

38:21.367 --> 38:24.470
but it's exciting.

38:24.503 --> 38:25.637
For the first time
in my life,

38:25.671 --> 38:28.374
everything I design
will have my name
on the tag.

38:28.407 --> 38:30.409
I would be honored
to join you.

38:32.578 --> 38:34.346
(CHUCKLES)

38:34.380 --> 38:37.349
No, India.

38:37.383 --> 38:39.351
It's pretty clear
you and I don't
work well together

38:39.385 --> 38:40.519
when we mix business
and pleasure.

38:40.552 --> 38:42.421
What pleasure?
You don't even
return my phone calls.

38:42.454 --> 38:45.357
I didn't know
what to say.

38:45.391 --> 38:47.393
I mean, I didn't even
know where we stood.

38:47.426 --> 38:48.560
I just flew halfway
around the world
to bring you back.

38:48.594 --> 38:51.463
I know,
and that means a lot.

38:54.400 --> 38:55.501
It does?

38:55.534 --> 38:56.568
Yeah.

38:58.404 --> 38:59.405
It does.

39:10.482 --> 39:14.553
I think that you and I
are much more appealing
as a romantic duo.

39:15.554 --> 39:17.423
Yeah, me too.

39:22.661 --> 39:25.531
So, when are you
coming back?

39:25.631 --> 39:29.435
Right away.

39:29.468 --> 39:31.637
There is one person
I do want to hire
from Donovan Decker.

39:31.670 --> 39:33.439
And let me guess
who that is.

39:50.556 --> 39:52.424
You look beautiful.

39:52.458 --> 39:53.459
Thanks.

39:54.560 --> 39:56.628
I owe you an apology.

39:56.662 --> 39:58.464
No, you... You don't.

39:58.497 --> 39:59.765
No, I do.

39:59.798 --> 40:03.535
I overreacted with the
whole sleepover thing,
and I'm sorry.

40:03.569 --> 40:05.571
I realize now
that you and Billy
are just friends

40:05.604 --> 40:07.506
and I have nothing
to worry about.

40:08.507 --> 40:11.510
Right.

40:11.543 --> 40:12.478
Good luck out there.

40:19.585 --> 40:20.586
(APPLAUSE)

40:27.659 --> 40:29.695
Stunning.

40:29.728 --> 40:33.465
* I wanna be next to you

40:33.499 --> 40:35.634
* And watch you
while you sleep

40:38.637 --> 40:40.606
* Holding you

40:41.673 --> 40:43.475
* Lost inside

40:43.509 --> 40:45.644
Have we met?

40:45.677 --> 40:45.944
Once before.

40:45.977 --> 40:47.613
When?

40:47.646 --> 40:47.679
I should go.

40:50.516 --> 40:52.551
Wait. No. I know
this sounds crazy.

40:52.584 --> 40:54.586
But I've been searching
for the girl that
lost this slipper.

40:54.620 --> 40:59.491
Would you mind
trying it on for me?

40:59.525 --> 41:00.626
ZOE: I'm really sorry
but I have to go.

41:00.659 --> 41:02.594
Please. Come on.

41:02.628 --> 41:05.731
It'll just take a second.
I have to know.

41:08.700 --> 41:11.570
* Happy

41:13.605 --> 41:16.542
* One minute more

41:16.575 --> 41:17.709
* A thousand years

41:17.743 --> 41:19.611
It's you.

41:19.645 --> 41:21.613
* It's all the same to me

41:23.782 --> 41:25.717
It's a perfect fit.

41:25.751 --> 41:28.554
It was you
that night at the ball.

41:28.587 --> 41:29.655
Yes.

41:29.688 --> 41:31.690
You're the one.

41:31.723 --> 41:36.528
* Every breath I breathe

41:36.562 --> 41:38.730
* I don't wanna live
a day without you

41:38.764 --> 41:43.735
* I just wanna
be the one that
makes you happy

41:43.769 --> 41:46.638
* Happy

41:47.773 --> 41:49.575
Are you okay?

41:50.676 --> 41:51.643
Yeah.

41:55.714 --> 41:57.616
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

42:00.686 --> 42:03.655
* That makes you happy

42:07.593 --> 42:10.762
* I try to let you know

42:10.796 --> 42:12.631
(LOUD CHEERING)

42:12.798 --> 42:15.634
WOMAN: Bravo!

42:15.667 --> 42:16.635
(WHOOPING)

42:19.738 --> 42:22.674
* I can't let
this moment go

42:22.708 --> 42:24.743
* When you're the only one

42:24.776 --> 42:29.615
* That makes me feel
the way I feel inside

42:37.756 --> 42:40.626
Well? What did you think?

42:40.659 --> 42:42.694
You were amazing.

42:42.728 --> 42:43.729
Thanks, Janey.

42:45.831 --> 42:50.736
* I just wanna
be the one that
makes you happy

42:50.769 --> 42:53.772
* Happy

42:53.805 --> 42:57.743
* I don't wanna live
a day without you

42:57.776 --> 43:02.714
* I just wanna
be the one that
makes you happy

43:02.748 --> 43:04.683
* Happy

43:19.765 --> 43:21.733
There's some people here
that want to talk to you.

43:21.767 --> 43:23.835
They're, like, raving
about your costumes.

43:23.869 --> 43:24.670
Really?

43:26.805 --> 43:28.774
Jane?

43:31.743 --> 43:32.811
* Makes you happy

43:32.844 --> 43:35.747
* I just wanna make you happy

43:37.716 --> 43:38.750
* Happy

43:38.784 --> 43:41.753
* I just wanna make you happy

43:43.722 --> 43:48.694
* I just wanna
make you happy *
