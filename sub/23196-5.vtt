WEBVTT

00:01.667 --> 00:05.462
And that's why you
should be... careful!

00:05.463 --> 00:06.964
I'm shot.

00:06.964 --> 00:08.256
And I'm Scott.

00:08.257 --> 00:10.092
And I'll see you on Monday.

00:10.092 --> 00:13.053
Don't you mean
"we'll see you on Monday"?

00:17.808 --> 00:18.850
Cut.

00:20.686 --> 00:22.126
I need to tell you
something, shotty.

00:24.273 --> 00:25.941
It's not gonna be easy.

00:25.942 --> 00:30.071
Hey, Scott. Producer sent us
down to deactivate shotbot.

00:30.071 --> 00:31.989
Just a minute, damn you!

00:31.989 --> 00:34.408
I don't understand.
Did I do something wrong?

00:36.285 --> 00:38.161
Don't you read
the user comments?

00:38.162 --> 00:41.498
The audience thinks you're weird.
They hate you.

00:41.499 --> 00:45.127
Scott, you don't
hate me, do you?

00:45.127 --> 00:47.087
Come on, time's up.

00:47.088 --> 00:49.715
Can we get this over with, huh?

00:49.715 --> 00:52.843
Well, Scott, it was
fun working with you.

00:56.722 --> 00:58.974
Vghs...

00:58.975 --> 01:01.811
wins!

01:01.811 --> 01:03.270
Scott, I love you.

01:05.147 --> 01:07.566
We'll see you...

01:07.567 --> 01:09.527
on Monday.

01:09.527 --> 01:12.655
Bunch o' brunch crunch.
Bunch o' bunch crunch.

01:14.240 --> 01:16.033
Aah!

01:16.033 --> 01:19.494
Go, shotty, run like the wind!

01:19.495 --> 01:22.122
But where do I go? What do I do?

01:22.123 --> 01:26.252
Find a scoop so hot, those dopes
upstairs will be forced to keep you!

01:26.252 --> 01:27.544
By gum, I'll do it!

01:27.545 --> 01:29.171
Goodbye, Scott!

01:29.171 --> 01:31.882
Remember, make it a heartwarmer,

01:31.882 --> 01:33.550
a tearjerker,

01:33.551 --> 01:35.886
a human story,
you beautiful bot!

01:35.886 --> 01:39.180
A human story!

02:33.402 --> 02:35.612
You're not wearing green!

02:35.613 --> 02:37.031
Merry leetmas, loser!

02:39.367 --> 02:40.409
What the...?

02:42.620 --> 02:46.332
Games? Games, get back
here and clean this up!

02:46.332 --> 02:48.417
"Well, screw you, Calhoun,"

02:48.417 --> 02:50.043
the students did say,

02:50.044 --> 02:52.838
"we'll just come up
with our own holiday,"

02:52.838 --> 02:54.881
with the best parts
of Christmas,

02:54.882 --> 02:57.259
earth day, Halloween,

02:57.259 --> 03:00.595
"cinco de Mayo
and all in between..."

03:00.596 --> 03:02.598
- Not on my day off.
- "We'll Carol till sundown..."

03:02.598 --> 03:04.266
Nope.

03:04.266 --> 03:08.766
"And with a jug of sweet
noob nog, leetmas was born."

03:09.146 --> 03:11.565
And that's the story
of leetmas...!

03:11.565 --> 03:13.692
Ted! Just the guy
I wanted to see.

03:13.693 --> 03:15.778
Merry leetmas, buddy.

03:15.778 --> 03:18.405
Whoa, thanks. It's a...

03:18.406 --> 03:21.909
It's a friendship badge.

03:21.909 --> 03:24.369
Yeah, they light up
when they get close, see?

03:24.370 --> 03:26.663
Um, awesome! Dude!

03:26.664 --> 03:29.041
Oh, I accidentally
ate your present.

03:29.041 --> 03:31.334
Oh, but I've got an idea!

03:31.335 --> 03:35.835
You are invited to
my super sweet egg race!

03:36.215 --> 03:38.884
Oh, thanks, man,
but I'm actually pretty busy

03:38.884 --> 03:40.302
getting ready for dinner.

03:40.302 --> 03:42.137
It's my present.
You have to come.

03:42.138 --> 03:44.431
Well, I...

03:44.432 --> 03:45.850
Come on. You're always
so busy with FPS stuff,

03:45.850 --> 03:47.351
we never get to hang anymore.

03:47.351 --> 03:48.852
Please, please, please, please.

03:48.853 --> 03:50.062
All right, all right, all right.

03:50.062 --> 03:51.354
What time...
What time is the race?

03:51.355 --> 03:53.774
- Three.
- Dude, dinner's at three.

03:53.774 --> 03:55.901
Yeah, m gonna be late for that.

03:55.901 --> 03:57.941
Oh! You're still making 'tater
salad, though, right?

03:59.321 --> 04:00.322
Yes.

04:00.322 --> 04:01.698
Um... all right, yeah.

04:01.699 --> 04:04.243
I guess we can push to 3:30.

04:04.243 --> 04:07.037
- What's at 3:30?
- Dinner. Brian's coming to my race!

04:07.037 --> 04:09.956
Wait a minute.
What about my pie?

04:09.957 --> 04:12.834
This is pl day pie.
If we don't eat it at 3:14, it's ruined.

04:12.835 --> 04:14.211
Bring it to the race.

04:14.211 --> 04:16.338
It'll be victory pie!

04:16.338 --> 04:18.964
No, it's pi day pie.

04:20.843 --> 04:23.595
Three-point-one-four.

04:23.596 --> 04:25.973
Um... you know what? Yeah, sure.

04:25.973 --> 04:28.725
Why don't we go ahead and
eat dessert before dinner?

04:28.726 --> 04:30.269
You know, 'cause, uh...

04:30.269 --> 04:33.272
Well, it's probably
opposite day anyway, right?

04:33.272 --> 04:34.773
It isn't!

04:34.774 --> 04:36.776
Thanks for not reminding me!

04:36.776 --> 04:39.487
Um, yeah. So, I've got go to
put this bird in the oven,

04:39.487 --> 04:41.030
but, uh, I'll see
you guys at the race.

04:44.241 --> 04:45.951
Not looking forward to it!

04:45.951 --> 04:48.536
Thanks for nothing.
You're terrible!

04:48.537 --> 04:50.664
Oh, I got one!
Hello, Brian, I love you!

04:50.664 --> 04:52.749
- You just complimented him.
- I know.

04:52.750 --> 04:54.084
Oh, wait. I mean, I don't know.

04:54.084 --> 04:56.211
I mean, yes, Brian, I hate you!

04:56.212 --> 04:58.214
I didn't mean it!
I mean, I didn't...!

04:58.214 --> 05:00.216
Brian, don't go away'!

05:00.216 --> 05:02.176
Il mean don't come back! Brian!

05:02.176 --> 05:04.761
<i>Help me, kl.</i>

05:04.762 --> 05:06.305
I won't.

05:19.360 --> 05:22.404
Cary, stop playing
baby's first extortion.

05:22.404 --> 05:24.572
Name a real price.

05:24.573 --> 05:28.994
Three hundred? You said
200 ten seconds ago!

05:28.994 --> 05:33.206
Cary, baby, why you gotta play
your fourth cousin like that?

05:35.793 --> 05:38.170
Yes, I know that the evidence
would exonerate the Law.

05:38.170 --> 05:40.422
I'm the one
on video framing him!

05:43.175 --> 05:45.719
Yeah, I know,
I was sloppy. Fine.

05:45.719 --> 05:47.470
Two-fifty.

05:47.471 --> 05:49.306
Just bring the driver
to the usual place,

05:49.306 --> 05:50.890
I'll hand you
a sack of kool-eze.

05:55.020 --> 05:57.355
Oh, yeah, no problem. He's right here.
Let me talk to him.

06:00.025 --> 06:01.317
- Hello.
- God!

06:01.318 --> 06:04.821
Ohh! Aah! No! No!

06:04.822 --> 06:06.740
Aaah!

06:06.740 --> 06:08.408
My, my, my.

06:08.409 --> 06:10.369
Looks like someone's
getting a lump of coal

06:10.369 --> 06:12.037
in their leetmas
Turkey this year.

06:14.623 --> 06:17.626
Okay, guys. Here's how
this is gonna shake out.

06:17.626 --> 06:19.294
Giggles, you're up first.

06:19.295 --> 06:20.963
I'm gonna wrap
my powerful thighs

06:20.963 --> 06:22.464
around your neck and squeeze.

06:22.464 --> 06:24.466
Won't be giggling then,
will you??

06:24.466 --> 06:27.343
I don't giggle.

06:27.344 --> 06:29.429
- I don't giggle, right?
- No. Guys, just beat him up.

06:29.430 --> 06:31.306
No, no, no! Uncle!

06:38.814 --> 06:40.690
Aloha, human students!

06:40.691 --> 06:43.694
I am a female teen from VGHS.

06:43.694 --> 06:46.238
Is there a human story here?

06:46.238 --> 06:48.281
It's a girl! She's gonna
tell the other girls!

06:48.282 --> 06:50.367
Oh, we're not gonna get any kisses?
Run!

06:52.161 --> 06:53.745
Um...

06:56.457 --> 06:59.126
This... this isn't over.

07:03.047 --> 07:06.300
Greetings!
Do you require assistance?

07:06.300 --> 07:08.093
Leave me alone, you stupid...

07:10.054 --> 07:11.096
Girl.

07:13.891 --> 07:15.851
I don't need
anything from anybody.

07:15.851 --> 07:17.394
I'm the Law.

07:17.394 --> 07:19.521
I'm prettier than even you!

07:27.029 --> 07:30.407
Brian, hold up!

07:30.407 --> 07:32.575
Achievement unlocked...
20 apples bobbed.

07:32.576 --> 07:34.578
Ha ha ha! Yeah,
in your face, duchess!

07:38.916 --> 07:40.751
How's the achievement
hunt going?

07:40.751 --> 07:42.502
Terrible. Duchess
is creaming me,

07:42.503 --> 07:44.004
and I lost my dance partner.

07:44.004 --> 07:45.672
Apparently I'm too intense.

07:45.673 --> 07:46.965
Speaking of which...

07:46.966 --> 07:49.176
Jenny, no, no, no!

07:49.176 --> 07:50.936
- I gotta get this bird in the oven.
- Brian!

07:52.179 --> 07:54.055
What time's the dance?

07:54.056 --> 07:56.808
Two o'clock.
Wear black and satin spats.

07:56.809 --> 07:58.185
And fix your hair.

08:19.164 --> 08:20.915
Pick up the phone much?

08:20.916 --> 08:21.958
Jeez!

08:24.044 --> 08:27.297
Look, Calhoun, it's
my day off, all right?

08:27.297 --> 08:29.507
Spare me your sob story.

08:29.508 --> 08:31.384
I've got your leetmas bonus.

08:31.385 --> 08:33.303
I get a bonus?

08:33.303 --> 08:34.345
Mm-hmm.

08:34.346 --> 08:36.472
Yeah. Bonus hours.

08:36.472 --> 08:38.349
That you work now. Mandatory.

08:38.350 --> 08:41.186
So get your ass
to the noob nog booth.

08:41.186 --> 08:43.188
You know, Calhoun, I've been
reading up on some child labor laws,

08:43.188 --> 08:44.647
and I don't think that...

08:44.648 --> 08:46.191
Do I smell
an unauthorized Turkey

08:46.191 --> 08:49.485
being cooked on school grounds?

08:51.113 --> 08:52.447
Grinch.

08:52.448 --> 08:53.490
Freeloader.

09:51.632 --> 09:52.883
You're a girl.

09:52.883 --> 09:54.843
You're not supposed
to be in here.

09:54.843 --> 09:58.638
That's too bad!
I like being here, with you!

10:03.143 --> 10:05.061
Golly, you're shaking.

10:05.062 --> 10:06.313
Allow me.

10:06.313 --> 10:08.648
Whoa.

10:08.649 --> 10:09.941
Heat functionality.

10:11.485 --> 10:13.278
Killer shotbot costume.

10:13.278 --> 10:16.572
Are you gonna enter this in the
Halloween costume contest or...?

10:16.573 --> 10:18.283
No!

10:18.283 --> 10:22.078
Tell me about what went
down in that alleyway.

10:22.079 --> 10:24.831
Oh, it's quite
a story all right.

10:24.832 --> 10:27.668
It's the story of
an FPS wunderkind,

10:27.668 --> 10:30.087
framed for a crime
he didn't commit

10:30.087 --> 10:33.423
by a sniveling RTS carpetbagger.

10:33.423 --> 10:36.050
It's the story of a school
that turned their backs on me

10:36.051 --> 10:38.053
when the chips were down.

10:38.053 --> 10:40.305
And once I get my hands
on that evidence,

10:40.305 --> 10:43.099
it's gonna be the story
of my redemption.

10:43.100 --> 10:44.476
Redemption, eh?

10:44.476 --> 10:46.686
That sounds like
a story the real shotbot

10:46.687 --> 10:48.522
would be interested in!

10:48.522 --> 10:49.814
Need a partner?

10:49.815 --> 10:51.942
Partner?

10:51.942 --> 10:55.195
Fat chance, doll face.
The Law rides alone.

10:55.195 --> 10:58.448
I see. That sounds very lonely.

10:58.448 --> 11:00.741
Why do you want
to help me, anyway?

11:00.742 --> 11:05.242
Because you're not the only one
looking for a second chance.

11:09.501 --> 11:11.294
Name's Law.

11:11.295 --> 11:13.922
Barbara. Rebecca Barbara.

11:13.922 --> 11:15.340
Well, Rebecca Barbara,

11:15.340 --> 11:17.550
let's go clear my name,

11:17.551 --> 11:20.345
put Shane behind behind bars,

11:20.345 --> 11:24.265
maybe... make out and
touch a bunch afterwards.

11:24.266 --> 11:25.850
Who knows? Let's see
where the wind blows.

11:25.851 --> 11:28.353
The wind is currently
blowing south by southwest

11:28.353 --> 11:30.438
at a speed of 1.2 knots.

11:30.439 --> 11:31.731
Yeah, right.

11:33.150 --> 11:35.152
Amazing. Let's go.

11:37.112 --> 11:39.114
Aaahhh!

11:39.114 --> 11:41.616
Strong girl!

11:46.663 --> 11:47.747
And we're back!

11:47.748 --> 11:49.541
Resident heartthrob games Dean

11:49.541 --> 11:51.751
here live at the noob nog booth.

11:51.752 --> 11:53.128
Hey, get back to work, Brian.

11:53.128 --> 11:54.379
Oh.

11:54.379 --> 11:56.130
Ah, sorry, guys.

11:56.131 --> 11:59.801
Extra whip on me!
All right! Yeah! Whoo!

12:07.976 --> 12:10.269
Um, hey, games, ll gotta pee.
Can you cover me?

12:10.270 --> 12:12.522
Uh, yeah, you got five
minutes till commercial break.

12:12.522 --> 12:13.731
Awesome, man, thanks.

12:13.732 --> 12:15.817
I'll be right back, ll promise.

12:15.817 --> 12:18.277
You are out of your minds if
you think I would skip that.

12:21.365 --> 12:23.408
According to those nerds
I just pumped for info,

12:23.408 --> 12:25.535
Shane will be meeting
his cousin at about 4:00.

12:25.535 --> 12:26.619
What you got?

12:26.620 --> 12:28.079
Well, according
to this interview,

12:28.080 --> 12:30.165
Shane enjoys chillaxing
with a cucumber scrub

12:30.165 --> 12:33.084
by his usual place,
the drinking fountains.

12:33.085 --> 12:35.712
Perhaps this is the usual
place he spoke of on the phone.

12:35.712 --> 12:38.923
Great work, babe.
All right, here's the plan.

12:38.924 --> 12:40.842
I'm gon' blast
400 reps on this thing,

12:40.842 --> 12:43.094
and then m gonna go
meet Shane and squeeze him up.

12:43.095 --> 12:45.430
That will not work.
You are flabby and sad.

12:45.430 --> 12:47.098
Shane will beat you up.

12:47.099 --> 12:50.227
Flabby and sad?

12:50.227 --> 12:51.895
<i>I'll show you.</i>

12:59.486 --> 13:01.154
Aah! You know what?

13:01.154 --> 13:03.406
I knew having
a partner was a bad idea.

13:03.407 --> 13:06.410
Just get lost.

13:06.410 --> 13:08.620
Shane has big muscles
and a black belt,

13:08.620 --> 13:12.165
but his cousin Cary has an ll.T.
Degree and cankles.

13:12.165 --> 13:14.333
The Law I know plays it smart

13:14.334 --> 13:16.544
and beats up on the little guy.

13:16.545 --> 13:18.964
Damn. You do get me.

13:20.257 --> 13:21.508
Hey, becks,

13:21.508 --> 13:24.344
about that whole
"get lost" thing,

13:24.344 --> 13:26.637
it's water under
the bridge, right?

13:26.638 --> 13:28.973
Water is composed of
hydrogen and oxygen.

13:28.974 --> 13:30.809
God, you're so smart.

13:32.019 --> 13:34.104
Let's go!

13:36.023 --> 13:37.691
Wow. That was incredible.

13:37.691 --> 13:40.068
I know, right?
Hey, can you bring cider tonight?

13:40.068 --> 13:42.153
- Yeah.
- Okay.

13:43.530 --> 13:45.782
Yeah! More things
in your face, duchess!

13:47.993 --> 13:50.620
Oh, crap! Dean's gonna kill me!

13:56.043 --> 13:57.586
Ah, games, m sorry.

13:57.586 --> 13:58.962
Yeah, thanks for lunch, Brian.

13:58.962 --> 14:00.797
I got an egg race to cover.

14:00.797 --> 14:02.215
Um...

14:02.215 --> 14:03.549
Brian, where have you stayed?

14:03.550 --> 14:06.678
The race is not gonna
start any year now!

14:06.678 --> 14:07.887
I'm kinda screwed here, Ki.

14:07.888 --> 14:09.514
<i>"Can you just tell Ted m sorry"?</i>

14:09.514 --> 14:11.807
Ted's gonna be so happy.

14:13.518 --> 14:16.062
I don't have an idea.
I won't be right back.

14:16.063 --> 14:17.606
What?

14:17.606 --> 14:20.692
Um, all right, extra,
extra whip on me, okay?

14:20.692 --> 14:22.527
Oh, easy.

14:24.112 --> 14:28.074
Yeah, well,
they were out of decaf,

14:28.075 --> 14:30.327
so I got you some green tea.

14:30.327 --> 14:31.911
Has the perp shown up yet?

14:31.912 --> 14:34.414
No!

14:34.414 --> 14:38.914
Well, looks like you and me are
in for a stakeout, Becky babs.

14:39.127 --> 14:41.796
So, Law, once you've
obtained your freedom,

14:41.797 --> 14:43.215
what's your next move?

14:43.215 --> 14:45.550
Well, once that happens, I'll...

14:45.550 --> 14:47.802
Probably become
rich and famous again.

14:47.803 --> 14:49.596
Speaking of which,
when that happens,

14:49.596 --> 14:51.764
don't expect me to,
like, care about you

14:51.765 --> 14:53.433
or buy you crap.

14:53.433 --> 14:54.684
I don't need crap.

14:54.684 --> 14:56.227
I just want to help!

14:58.355 --> 15:00.732
For real?

15:00.732 --> 15:03.109
Girl, you are weird.

15:03.110 --> 15:04.611
I dig weird.

15:04.611 --> 15:06.613
My other school
said I was so weird

15:06.613 --> 15:08.114
that our ratings plunged

15:08.115 --> 15:10.117
and they were going
to deactivate me.

15:10.117 --> 15:11.535
That's so stupid.

15:11.535 --> 15:14.329
Your school sounds like my dad,

15:14.329 --> 15:16.539
and I hate your school.

15:16.540 --> 15:19.167
Your school doesn't know
what he's talking about.

15:19.167 --> 15:22.170
Your school should have
left mom a long time ago!

15:23.964 --> 15:26.841
You're amazing, Rebecca.

15:26.842 --> 15:29.594
No one's ever left me
that comment before.

15:29.594 --> 15:32.888
Excuse me, my eyes
are malfunctioning.

15:32.889 --> 15:34.724
Yeah, uh...

15:34.724 --> 15:36.350
I got something in mine too...

15:36.351 --> 15:38.811
Dust or something.

15:40.105 --> 15:41.314
Look!

15:41.314 --> 15:43.607
There he is.

15:43.608 --> 15:45.401
It's Cary. Let's go!

15:45.402 --> 15:47.028
Go, go, go!

15:51.408 --> 15:54.411
Hey, do you know what
station the egg race is on?

15:54.411 --> 15:58.373
Brian!

15:58.373 --> 15:59.957
I stole the finish line.
Now you can see Ted win.

15:59.958 --> 16:02.126
Please tell me
it's still opposite day.

16:02.127 --> 16:04.921
Oh, no, it's almost 3:15.
He's never gonna make it.

16:04.921 --> 16:06.255
Happy pl day, Brian.

16:10.844 --> 16:13.096
Ted, eat this
in the next ten seconds.

16:13.096 --> 16:15.431
You got it, kiwi.

16:15.432 --> 16:17.100
This is really good, Ki!

16:17.100 --> 16:20.186
Aaahhhh!

16:24.816 --> 16:26.317
It's coming out of your pay.

16:39.748 --> 16:42.125
Whassup, idiot?

16:42.125 --> 16:43.417
Whoo!

16:43.418 --> 16:44.961
You got a pretty neck, Cary!

16:44.961 --> 16:47.046
Think I might have to squeeze it

16:47.047 --> 16:49.549
if you don't give me
what's on that drive.

16:49.549 --> 16:51.968
Sorry I'm late, Cary, I just...

16:51.968 --> 16:54.720
Law? What are you doing here?

16:59.184 --> 17:01.477
Thank you so much.

17:01.478 --> 17:04.063
What are we gonna do with you?

17:04.064 --> 17:06.023
Don't hurt him, Shane!

17:06.023 --> 17:08.401
Wait, why is shotbot still here?

17:08.401 --> 17:12.488
It's not shotbot, you idiot,
it's my smoking hot girlfriend!

17:12.489 --> 17:13.615
Girlfriend?

17:13.615 --> 17:16.951
Girlfriend? No! No! No!

17:16.952 --> 17:20.038
I mean, you know
that's shotbot, right?

17:20.038 --> 17:21.789
I mean, you just do.
You have to.

17:21.790 --> 17:25.417
I mean, look.

17:25.417 --> 17:26.836
No. No!

17:26.836 --> 17:28.503
That's impossible!

17:28.505 --> 17:31.466
No, I... I don't accept this.

17:31.466 --> 17:33.050
I mean, that is so a robot...

17:33.051 --> 17:35.011
It's just... you...

17:35.011 --> 17:37.346
You met him, on "pwnzwn."

17:37.347 --> 17:39.265
It's just... what? Wow!

17:39.266 --> 17:41.309
I just...

17:41.309 --> 17:43.436
I can't... you guys?

17:43.436 --> 17:45.479
You guys, just take him away.

17:46.940 --> 17:48.191
You!

17:48.191 --> 17:50.943
You used me for a story!
I trusted you!

17:50.944 --> 17:53.279
Law, I can explain!

17:53.280 --> 17:54.698
I don't want to hear it.

17:54.698 --> 17:56.408
Guys, let's go.

17:58.493 --> 17:59.952
I hate you, shotbot!

18:01.580 --> 18:04.583
I hate you!

18:06.668 --> 18:08.586
Yeah, duchess thought
she had it in the bag,

18:08.587 --> 18:11.715
and then, bam, I turned on
the blood elevator.

18:11.715 --> 18:14.509
And the spookiest
gingerbread house goes to...

18:14.509 --> 18:15.593
Jenny Matrix!

18:15.594 --> 18:17.345
Mmm!

18:18.513 --> 18:19.972
Um...

18:19.973 --> 18:22.058
<i>I'm guessing
you forgot the cider?</i>

18:22.058 --> 18:23.726
If by "forgot cider,"

18:23.727 --> 18:26.938
you mean ruled leetmas day
like a yuletide goddess,

18:26.938 --> 18:29.315
then, yes, ll forgot the cider.

18:29.316 --> 18:31.109
Sorry about that.

18:31.109 --> 18:32.693
No, no, no. You know what?

18:32.694 --> 18:34.278
It's fine, "cause
we don't need cider."

18:34.279 --> 18:35.863
We don't need pie.

18:35.864 --> 18:37.824
We don't need...
Wait, where's Ted?

18:37.824 --> 18:38.950
Right here, dude.

18:38.950 --> 18:40.117
Dude, you're eating a burger?

18:40.118 --> 18:41.619
I thought you were
going to shower.

18:41.620 --> 18:45.373
I did. But then one thing
led to another, and...

18:45.373 --> 18:46.624
Gimme.

18:46.625 --> 18:48.418
Anyway, let's chow.

18:50.587 --> 18:53.798
Dude, where's the potato salad?

18:53.798 --> 18:55.716
Sorry, dude, no salad.

18:55.717 --> 18:58.177
But you know what?

18:58.178 --> 19:00.221
At least we're all
here together, right?

19:00.221 --> 19:02.014
Yeah, I guess.

19:02.015 --> 19:05.935
You know what? Let's just
enjoy this perfect Turkey.

19:12.984 --> 19:15.361
Merry leetmas, guys.

19:15.362 --> 19:16.696
Mangia.

19:28.208 --> 19:29.959
Hmm?

19:29.959 --> 19:31.669
The salt. There's no salt.

19:31.670 --> 19:33.463
I forgot the salt. My Brian.

19:33.463 --> 19:36.007
I'm sure it's fine, Brian.

19:36.007 --> 19:37.633
A low-sodium diet
is a good thing.

19:37.634 --> 19:39.427
Instead of salt, we could use...

19:39.427 --> 19:41.053
You know what, Ki,
just stop, okay?

19:41.054 --> 19:42.680
There's salt in Brian.

19:42.681 --> 19:45.058
Brian has salt. That's
how it works. The end.

19:45.058 --> 19:46.559
Oh, do you want
some of my burger?

19:47.769 --> 19:49.020
No, Ted,

19:49.020 --> 19:50.688
ll don't want
any of your burger.

19:52.774 --> 19:55.276
I asked for one thing,
to cook you guys dinner.

19:55.276 --> 19:57.403
That's it. Is that too much?

19:57.404 --> 19:59.989
But no, instead it's,
"come to my race, Brian.

19:59.989 --> 20:01.490
"Dance with me, Brian.

20:01.491 --> 20:04.076
Let's have dessert
before dinner, Brian."

20:04.077 --> 20:05.912
And I ask for what?

20:05.912 --> 20:08.623
Cider? Pie?
Not to destroy my booth,

20:08.623 --> 20:10.625
which I have to pay for,
by the way.

20:10.625 --> 20:13.419
I can't afford tuition. I can't
be seen with my girlfriend.

20:13.420 --> 20:15.088
- Brian!
- And I don't ask for crap...

20:15.088 --> 20:16.088
from any of you!

20:17.882 --> 20:20.301
Wait, you two are dating?

20:22.178 --> 20:23.387
Why didn't you tell me?

20:23.388 --> 20:27.308
Wow, Ted, be more needy.

20:27.308 --> 20:29.310
Make this more about you.
You are the most selfish...

20:29.310 --> 20:31.395
Okay, Brian, let's go.

20:31.396 --> 20:34.065
No, you know what?
It's fine. Forget it.

20:34.065 --> 20:35.566
Enjoy your burger.

20:35.567 --> 20:37.193
Sorry I'm late.

20:37.193 --> 20:39.695
I brought yams.

20:40.947 --> 20:43.240
You'll be hearing
from my lawyer.

20:45.118 --> 20:47.870
So... is he serious about that?

20:49.497 --> 20:51.040
"Cause I'd be
in a lot of trouble."

21:00.258 --> 21:03.844
Everybody! Merry leetmas!

21:03.845 --> 21:06.097
May I have your attention,
please.

21:06.097 --> 21:09.975
The RTS team is proud to present
for your dunking pleasure

21:09.976 --> 21:12.478
the one, the only...

21:12.479 --> 21:14.481
Thank god for that...

21:14.481 --> 21:15.899
The Law!

21:27.911 --> 21:29.704
That's right.

21:29.704 --> 21:31.288
Take on the Law in the one game

21:31.289 --> 21:33.624
he can't cheat his way out of.

21:33.625 --> 21:36.919
One good throw is all that
stands between this scumbag

21:36.920 --> 21:39.547
and 200 gallons
of ice-cold water.

21:41.841 --> 21:45.386
So show him how you feel, VGHS!

21:51.184 --> 21:53.186
Was this your
master plan, Shane?

21:53.186 --> 21:55.188
Get my underpants soggy?

21:55.188 --> 21:56.939
Oh, Law.

21:56.940 --> 22:00.151
My master plan is real
estate in Barbados.

22:00.151 --> 22:03.320
This is just funny.

22:03.321 --> 22:05.156
Isn't it ironic?

22:05.156 --> 22:07.533
Their misplaced hatred of you,

22:07.534 --> 22:09.160
based on a lie,

22:09.160 --> 22:12.746
is gonna destroy the only
evidence of the truth.

22:12.747 --> 22:15.583
Oh!

22:15.583 --> 22:17.710
It's ironic, right?

22:17.710 --> 22:20.170
I don't know,
I just kind of throw that word around.

22:20.171 --> 22:22.631
Oh!

22:22.632 --> 22:24.091
Heyo!

22:24.092 --> 22:25.968
Hey, it's Reggie.

22:25.969 --> 22:27.512
He's my broker.

22:27.512 --> 22:29.388
I just made a hundred grand.

22:29.389 --> 22:31.307
We're gonna go get oysters.

22:31.307 --> 22:32.808
Me and reg.

22:32.809 --> 22:35.269
But... have fun here.

22:38.273 --> 22:41.609
Down with the Law!
Down with the Law!

22:49.409 --> 22:52.036
Shotty! Great news.

22:52.036 --> 22:53.787
"Pwnzwn" wants you back.

22:53.788 --> 22:56.373
You going undercover
as a student went megaviral.

22:56.374 --> 22:58.584
I got my job back, but I failed.

22:58.585 --> 23:00.461
I didn't get my human story.

23:00.461 --> 23:03.547
Who cares? You're a hit.

23:03.548 --> 23:06.259
Scott, when those guards
were sent to deactivate me,

23:06.259 --> 23:08.261
you fought for me.

23:08.261 --> 23:11.597
Is that because
you care about me?

23:11.598 --> 23:13.600
Yeah, you big green goof!
Now, get in!

23:13.600 --> 23:16.144
Wait a sec,
I kind of live in here.

23:34.621 --> 23:35.955
Ohh!

23:46.758 --> 23:48.468
I know.

23:48.468 --> 23:50.178
I'm cleaning it up, all right?

23:50.178 --> 23:52.471
Yeah, good job.

23:52.472 --> 23:55.683
So... pretty epic
blowup back there.

23:55.683 --> 23:56.767
Yep.

23:56.768 --> 23:59.479
I'm a jerk. I get it.

23:59.479 --> 24:02.023
Look, kid, first...

24:02.023 --> 24:03.583
Get up, "cause you're
lying in eggnog."

24:15.411 --> 24:18.122
Second, you're not a jerk.

24:18.122 --> 24:21.667
Believe me, my kid's
a jerk, like, hardcore.

24:21.668 --> 24:23.294
You just snapped.

24:23.294 --> 24:25.462
Listen...

24:25.463 --> 24:26.922
Take tomorrow off.

24:26.923 --> 24:28.883
Well, I mean,
finish cleaning this up,

24:28.883 --> 24:31.635
and consider that
even for the yams.

24:33.304 --> 24:35.597
I really screwed up, didn't I?

24:39.435 --> 24:42.896
I don't think I could fix this.

24:42.897 --> 24:46.275
You made a mistake.
You're a good kid.

24:46.275 --> 24:49.111
Now, stop cue-cuing about it
and go apologize.

24:50.738 --> 24:52.030
Brian!

24:52.031 --> 24:54.116
I mean, clean this up, Brian!

24:54.117 --> 24:56.619
You're being lazy!

24:56.619 --> 24:58.120
Merry leetmas, Calhoun!

24:58.121 --> 24:59.413
Go to hell, Brian!

25:04.836 --> 25:06.963
Hey, guys.

25:06.963 --> 25:08.422
Uh...

25:08.423 --> 25:11.926
About before. I'm sorry.

25:11.926 --> 25:13.594
It's okay.

25:13.594 --> 25:15.053
No, it's not.

25:16.931 --> 25:20.309
I need to be able to open up to you.
I just...

25:20.309 --> 25:22.936
hate feeling like a burden.

25:22.937 --> 25:24.438
Ohh.

25:27.692 --> 25:28.984
Oh!

25:28.985 --> 25:30.528
We brought mops.

25:30.528 --> 25:32.738
And more pie.

25:32.739 --> 25:34.365
We're gonna help you clean.

25:34.365 --> 25:36.450
Okay, Brian, you start
by eating that pie.

25:36.451 --> 25:37.952
Jenny and I will tackle the nog.

25:37.952 --> 25:39.620
Ted, dismantle the booth?

25:46.878 --> 25:48.170
Ted...

25:48.171 --> 25:50.173
Hey.

25:50.173 --> 25:51.799
We're cool.

25:56.179 --> 25:58.723
Yeah.

25:58.723 --> 26:01.016
How about I get you some soda

26:01.017 --> 26:02.685
to wash down that pie?

26:03.936 --> 26:06.188
All right. Thanks, buddy.

26:26.084 --> 26:29.253
This is when it happens!
This is when it happens!

26:49.565 --> 26:51.441
Law!

26:51.442 --> 26:53.694
Hang on! I'm coming!

27:03.454 --> 27:05.038
How do I get you out of here?

27:05.039 --> 27:06.915
You can't.

27:06.916 --> 27:10.127
We both know these
pythons won't hold.

27:12.213 --> 27:14.548
I'm sorry I lied.

27:14.549 --> 27:17.176
If you knew I was a robot,
you'd never like me.

27:17.176 --> 27:19.887
Oh, shotbot, that's ridiculous.

27:19.887 --> 27:23.432
I didn't like you
for your smokin' looks.

27:23.432 --> 27:26.685
I liked you "cause you're rad."

27:26.686 --> 27:29.146
Now get out of here
with those bedroom eyes.

27:29.147 --> 27:32.650
I can't stand you
to see me like this.

27:32.650 --> 27:35.653
Not until ll finish my story.

27:35.653 --> 27:38.781
Here's the first draft.

27:38.781 --> 27:41.200
Bot meets boy!

27:41.200 --> 27:42.367
What are you doing?

27:42.368 --> 27:44.244
Bot falls for boy.

27:44.245 --> 27:46.455
You idiot!
The water will kill you!

27:46.455 --> 27:49.458
Bot hurts boy.

27:49.458 --> 27:51.418
What are you doing? Stop!

27:51.419 --> 27:55.589
And now... I'm sorry,
Law, but boy loses bot.

27:59.552 --> 28:00.761
Don't do it!

28:04.390 --> 28:08.811
No!

28:08.811 --> 28:10.395
Law.

28:34.754 --> 28:35.921
No!

28:50.728 --> 28:53.397
Good night...

28:53.397 --> 28:54.940
sweet bot.

29:09.580 --> 29:11.748
This robot...

29:11.749 --> 29:14.376
Was the greatest journalist

29:14.377 --> 29:16.212
the world has ever known.

29:18.381 --> 29:21.550
Who among you...

29:21.550 --> 29:23.760
will honor him?

29:23.761 --> 29:25.220
I will.

29:29.976 --> 29:31.227
My man.

29:41.862 --> 29:44.865
My god. The Law
didn't cheat after all.

29:44.865 --> 29:46.575
He was framed!

29:46.575 --> 29:48.368
<i>- By who?
- I don't know.</i>

29:48.369 --> 29:51.580
Those files got wet.
