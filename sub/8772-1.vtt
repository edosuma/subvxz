04:34.721 --> 04:35.764
Key doesn't work.

04:36.806 --> 04:39.621
Government-issued. What'd you expect?

04:39.934 --> 04:42.020
Somebody's gonna have to break in.

04:44.105 --> 04:46.607
Great. Parole violation.

04:51.403 --> 04:54.427
...on official U.S. orders yet.

04:54.531 --> 04:56.617
You won't be the first.

05:17.470 --> 05:19.555
Got it.

05:33.109 --> 05:35.090
All right. Now this place has promise.

05:35.195 --> 05:41.138
What more could you want. There's sheets on the
furniture and the cemetery in the back yard, and...

05:41.972 --> 05:43.536
...cobwebs on the lampshades.

05:44.578 --> 05:47.706
All right, all right. Lance, why don't
we get the generator started, and...

05:47.706 --> 05:48.749
...where's the basement?

05:48.749 --> 05:50.834
Well, there should be a door
somewhere... over...

05:52.920 --> 05:53.858
...there.

05:53.962 --> 05:55.943
Where do you want the phones?

05:56.048 --> 05:56.986
Any of the rooms.

05:57.090 --> 05:59.697
We won't have a line out until tomorrow.

06:01.261 --> 06:03.346
- Great.
- Wanna go home, Wanda?

06:05.431 --> 06:08.559
Don't forget, Whitaker did see something...
...something that drove him out of his mind.

06:08.559 --> 06:11.479
Alex Whitaker was nuts, man. Period.

06:12.730 --> 06:15.337
That's what we're here to find out.

06:50.265 --> 06:52.351
Wanda, can you help me with this?

06:56.521 --> 06:59.649
I thought I heard something,
some kind of groaning.

07:03.820 --> 07:06.843
Come on, it's an old place.
It was following the track of the weather.

07:06.948 --> 07:09.033
No, it was something else.
It was some kind of...

07:09.033 --> 07:10.076
...flapping or something.

07:10.076 --> 07:11.014
It was really strange.

07:11.118 --> 07:13.099
Hey, don't start getting
spooked on me already.

07:13.204 --> 07:16.436
At least wait 'till I get
everything set up, all right?

07:17.374 --> 07:18.313
OK.

07:18.417 --> 07:20.502
What do you want me to with this?

07:21.545 --> 07:24.151
In the camera'd be nice.

07:51.782 --> 07:54.805
First law of paranormal investigation:
Check for hollow walls...

07:54.910 --> 07:57.933
...where the very normal can hide.

07:59.080 --> 08:01.165
According to this, the walls
are filled with passageways...

08:01.165 --> 08:03.147
...some only a few feet wide.

08:03.251 --> 08:07.317
That would explain the... uhh... measurements
are slightly off. This whole place is.

08:07.421 --> 08:10.445
It was built by an eccentric
old woman who fancied herself a mystic.

08:10.549 --> 08:12.530
Listen to this:

08:12.635 --> 08:15.658
"I was told of the hill's mystical
aura by a fascinating Egyptian...

08:15.763 --> 08:21.393
...and so I built my hotel here
as a haven for all spiritual wayfarers...

08:22.018 --> 08:25.459
...who long to escape this
imperfect, worldly plane."

08:53.298 --> 08:55.383
Goddamn!

09:12.066 --> 09:15.089
Excuse me, I'm lost.
I'm looking for Scarab Hill.

09:16.236 --> 09:17.799
Wrong road.

09:17.800 --> 09:18.842
I know.

09:18.843 --> 09:21.658
How do I get to the right one?

09:23.535 --> 09:24.473
Mr...

09:24.577 --> 09:25.516
You there!

09:25.620 --> 09:27.705
What do you want?

09:28.748 --> 09:30.729
She wants the hotel.

09:30.833 --> 09:32.919
What for?

09:35.004 --> 09:37.089
You got this hooked up yet?

09:42.302 --> 09:45.326
Boy. That's gonna stop 'em.

09:45.430 --> 09:47.515
Stop what?

09:47.516 --> 09:51.165
Some critters've been getting here
and chewing up the hogs.

09:51.686 --> 09:56.795
Killed one of the mules too.
Tore her head all up.

09:56.900 --> 09:57.838
Ate her brain.

09:57.942 --> 09:59.923
Animal mutilations?

10:01.070 --> 10:03.050
Maybe it's a cult?

10:03.051 --> 10:06.805
Are there any Satanists in the area?
- Don't know nothing about no cults.

10:07.326 --> 10:09.307
Where'd you say you was goin'?

10:09.411 --> 10:12.956
Scarab Hill. It's near Bodega Bay.

10:14.625 --> 10:17.648
Get back on the highway,
turn left at the crossroads...

10:17.753 --> 10:21.819
...and if your luck runs out,
you'll find the place.

10:21.923 --> 10:24.008
My luck?

10:25.051 --> 10:28.075
You know what's good for you,
you'll stay away from that hotel!

10:29.222 --> 10:36.520
They say Satan's got a suite of rooms in there, and brim-
stone comes out of the chimneys at night, and it smells...

10:37.563 --> 10:39.648
...like roasted entrails.

10:40.691 --> 10:42.776
You ever smell roasted entrails, lady?

10:47.989 --> 10:50.179
They're always the last to burn.

11:27.610 --> 11:29.695
All set.

11:31.259 --> 11:34.179
Well, I sure hope these things work.

11:39.600 --> 11:41.685
All right.

11:41.686 --> 11:43.770
Can we still cover all the areas
that we wanted?

11:43.771 --> 11:49.505
Well, we got more cameras than monitors, so the views
were all over. Though what it needs is still set-ups...

11:49.506 --> 11:52.633
...We got a good chance of
catching any funny stuff.

11:52.634 --> 11:54.719
That's what I love about the agency...
...money's never an object.

11:54.720 --> 11:56.804
Yeah, unless we have to ask for it.

11:56.805 --> 11:59.931
Come on, lads. Paranormal research
is only funded...

11:59.932 --> 12:04.103
...to keep a small segment of the public amused.
The enquiring mind types.

12:05.145 --> 12:08.272
The government wasted no time
instigating this study.

12:08.273 --> 12:12.444
We're not here to keep anyone amused.

12:13.487 --> 12:16.510
What we call reality is the illusion.

12:16.614 --> 12:18.804
That's what's amusing.

12:19.742 --> 12:21.723
Did you know that?

12:22.870 --> 12:23.913
What, I'm sorry?

12:25.998 --> 12:27.979
You won't hear their voices on that, my dear.

12:29.126 --> 12:31.837
They will come to you when you
open your mind and heart.

12:32.254 --> 12:35.591
They're not here to frighten us.

12:38.510 --> 12:40.595
Do you think you can capture
the darkest secrets...

12:40.595 --> 12:43.619
...of the universe on these
tiny televisions sets?

12:43.723 --> 12:48.832
Science can only give you facts.
Truth comes from feeling.

12:48.937 --> 12:51.021
Camille, could you make yourself useful?

12:51.022 --> 12:54.046
I thought I was.

12:54.150 --> 12:57.798
I'm gonna make some coffee.
Wanna give me a hand?

12:57.799 --> 12:59.363
Of course. None for me, though.
I don't drink coffee.

12:59.364 --> 13:02.491
Yeah, I know.
I read your column.

13:03.534 --> 13:06.662
- Chamomile tea.
- How thoughtful.

13:10.832 --> 13:13.335
Little Shirley MacLaine.
What's she doing here?

13:15.003 --> 13:17.088
Camille is eccentric but no fraud.

13:18.131 --> 13:21.884
I'm just hoping she might tune
into something a scientist wouldn't.

14:56.140 --> 14:58.224
This is a lot better than university food.

14:58.225 --> 15:00.310
I've forgotten how good
a home-cooked meal could be.

15:00.311 --> 15:02.395
Whose home?

15:02.396 --> 15:03.438
I felt inspired in the kitchen.

15:03.438 --> 15:06.253
Such wonderful old appliances,
and all just... left here.

15:07.609 --> 15:09.590
The last owner had no heir...

15:09.694 --> 15:11.779
...so the state assumed title.

15:12.822 --> 15:15.324
I'm afraid a great violence was done here.

15:18.035 --> 15:23.770
The taint of unholy fury has been absorbed
by every particle of this place.

15:24.291 --> 15:28.462
"The taint of..." - Isn't it a little
melodramatic even for you?

15:29.505 --> 15:32.631
Exactly how did the owner die?

15:32.632 --> 15:36.803
A horrible death. Her brain was extracted.

15:37.846 --> 15:39.930
Through her nose.

15:39.931 --> 15:43.059
As in Egyptian mummification?

15:44.102 --> 15:47.229
Her death came to the attention
of one of our junior researchers.

15:47.230 --> 15:52.442
His investigation uncovered the disappearance of an
entire group of psychics that were working here.

15:52.443 --> 15:54.527
That led us to Alex Whitaker.

15:54.528 --> 15:57.655
Alex was the only one of the psychics
who survived whatever happened here.

15:57.656 --> 16:00.263
In an asylum.

16:01.305 --> 16:08.081
Afterwards, he had terrible
seizures... premonitions.

16:08.083 --> 16:14.337
Completely schizophrenic, of course,
but there was something about him that...

16:14.338 --> 16:17.362
The cross of prophecy
is indeed a heavy burden.

16:17.466 --> 16:21.637
But one that you will cheerfully drop
if a hefty pay check rolls your way, right?

16:22.680 --> 16:25.807
You're referring to my column in
"The Inquiring Planet," I assume?

16:25.808 --> 16:29.874
Yeah. I love those predictions:
"Do those alien medics...

16:29.978 --> 16:31.959
...ever give our race a sex change?"

16:32.063 --> 16:33.002
Patrick!

16:33.106 --> 16:38.318
If I've had to occasionally compromise
my gift to pay my bills, Mr. Bramwell...

16:38.319 --> 16:40.300
...don't judge me, until you've
tried the same.

16:41.447 --> 16:43.533
Please excuse me.

16:46.661 --> 16:48.642
Why did you do that?

16:49.788 --> 16:50.831
You deliberately attacked her.

16:52.916 --> 16:56.044
I don't know. Maybe I just...

16:57.087 --> 17:00.215
...I had too much wine. Sorry. Sorry.

17:03.343 --> 17:06.471
It's all right, Paddy. You're tired.
Why don't you go to bed?

17:16.896 --> 17:22.111
He can't handle alcohol, the trait
he inherited from our father.

18:00.167 --> 18:01.731
I'm sorry, sis.

18:05.693 --> 18:07.674
Tell me what's in the news?

18:07.987 --> 18:11.845
An account of a suicide
committed here 50 years ago.

18:12.158 --> 18:14.243
Andre Toulon?

18:15.286 --> 18:19.352
Toulon. I took a picture of a grave out back
with that name on. Who is that guy?

18:19.456 --> 18:24.147
Apparently, he was a great puppet master.
He escaped Germany during the war.

18:24.148 --> 18:28.840
This article says that the Nazis followed him here
but he shot himself before they could catch him.

18:29.883 --> 18:31.864
I wonder what they wanted.

18:31.968 --> 18:35.409
He was probably just smuggling
stuff inside of his puppets.

18:36.139 --> 18:40.205
They did want something. He made sure that
no one could force him to reveal it.

18:40.309 --> 18:42.290
But this proves that Alex wasn't just raving.

18:42.916 --> 18:46.044
It confirms Toulon's
connection to this place.

18:52.613 --> 18:53.864
Oh god! I saw them!

18:54.489 --> 18:55.845
Two of them.

18:55.949 --> 18:56.991
What, Camille?

18:56.992 --> 18:59.076
No taller than that. In my room.

18:59.077 --> 19:02.204
Like horrible little demons. One had a knife.

19:02.205 --> 19:03.247
What happened?

19:03.248 --> 19:04.290
Camille saw something upstairs.

19:04.291 --> 19:05.852
Lance, go get the camera.

19:05.853 --> 19:08.565
No, don't go up there. 
- Don't worry about it. We'll be back.

19:31.399 --> 19:34.423
I know the difference between what
I saw and these ridiculous dolls.

19:35.048 --> 19:37.132
Of course you do.
Nobody's suggesting any different.

19:37.133 --> 19:38.176
But you don't believe me?

19:38.177 --> 19:41.303
It's not important whether we
believe you or not.

19:41.304 --> 19:43.388
We need proof, Camille, you know that.

19:43.390 --> 19:45.474
You'll all have proof soon enough.

19:45.475 --> 19:46.935
I know I'm already shaking.

19:47.560 --> 19:50.688
Why? Do you know something we don't?

19:51.209 --> 19:54.650
It's just a feeling,
but I've learned to trust them.

19:55.380 --> 19:59.446
I'm afraid we're all in danger as long as
we remain in this house.

19:59.551 --> 20:01.114
I'm leaving tonight.

20:01.115 --> 20:02.470
You can't be serious?

20:02.679 --> 20:06.849
I am. And I suggest you do the same.

20:38.650 --> 20:41.255
What do you want?

20:41.257 --> 20:43.342
What are you trying to tell me?

20:49.389 --> 20:51.683
Please.

20:52.726 --> 20:54.811
Speak to me.

21:45.379 --> 21:47.465
I understand, but to leave
all of her things behind...

21:47.466 --> 21:50.071
...she must have been more upset
than I thought.

21:50.697 --> 21:54.138
Of course. And please let me
know as soon as you hear from her.

21:55.076 --> 21:56.327
Good bye.

21:59.455 --> 22:02.479
He said it's not unusual of his mother
to take off like this.

22:03.104 --> 22:04.667
I told you.

22:04.668 --> 22:07.796
He said she hangs out in some ashram
with her crystals.

22:09.360 --> 22:11.966
I don't know, I just feel so responsible
for her leaving.

22:11.967 --> 22:15.721
You're not responsible for anything.

22:15.929 --> 22:18.223
She's just loony, Carolyn.

22:20.308 --> 22:22.393
Relax.

22:48.460 --> 22:51.066
Something to keep your eyes open.

22:51.588 --> 22:53.673
Very romantic.

22:55.237 --> 22:56.280
What time is it?

22:56.281 --> 22:57.843
Almost one.

22:57.844 --> 22:59.928
How's the show?

22:59.929 --> 23:02.953
Well, It's not gonna win any rating
sweeps, that's for sure.

23:03.057 --> 23:08.269
Well, if there is something there, it doesn't
look like it's gonna play in the cameras for us.

23:08.270 --> 23:09.834
Thanks.

23:35.379 --> 23:38.403
I thought you went to bed hours ago.

23:39.028 --> 23:40.488
I couldn't sleep.

23:40.592 --> 23:45.284
Every little sheep that jumped over a fence
landed under a horny ram.

23:50.497 --> 23:52.060
So...

23:52.061 --> 23:53.104
...when's your shift over?

23:53.104 --> 23:55.189
Three.

23:57.275 --> 24:00.298
You shouldn't watch TV in the dark.
It's bad for you.

24:00.402 --> 24:02.488
It strains your eye muscles.

24:03.530 --> 24:07.180
You should give them a rest
and strain another muscle.

24:10.829 --> 24:12.810
So, where are you going at three?

24:13.957 --> 24:18.126
- Straight to bed.
- Oh.

24:18.128 --> 24:20.213
But it's a double.

24:21.255 --> 24:23.445
Well, it's a date then.

24:25.426 --> 24:26.469
What? What is it?

24:28.033 --> 24:29.597
That door wasn't open.

24:37.938 --> 24:38.876
Oh my god!

24:38.980 --> 24:41.066
Come on!

25:36.326 --> 25:37.890
Patrick!

25:41.539 --> 25:43.102
Patrick!

25:43.103 --> 25:44.145
Oh my god.

25:44.146 --> 25:45.606
What?

25:46.753 --> 25:48.838
I can't... I... It was this...

25:53.009 --> 25:55.094
Patrick!

26:01.350 --> 26:03.435
Get that thing out of here!

26:20.117 --> 26:22.203
Carolyn?

26:43.056 --> 26:46.288
This thing is completely self-contained.

26:47.226 --> 26:50.250
Just gears and wood mostly...

26:51.397 --> 26:53.481
...not even any motors.

26:53.482 --> 26:55.463
It's amazing.

26:56.089 --> 27:00.468
It must run chemically somehow.
Off this fluid.

27:03.387 --> 27:05.368
Do you mean an artificial life force?

27:05.994 --> 27:07.557
Yeah.

27:07.558 --> 27:13.291
A morphic genetic response is...
...it can't be possible.

27:13.293 --> 27:17.359
I'd say that Patrick led us to an incredible
scientific discovery.

27:17.463 --> 27:20.070
Maybe one of the most
important finds of our time.

27:50.828 --> 27:54.998
What is this thing?
It's gotta be subject to physical laws.

28:09.596 --> 28:11.681
I am Eriquee Chaneé.

28:16.894 --> 28:21.064
Please excuse my abrupt appearance...

28:21.065 --> 28:24.297
...but your presence is equally unexpected.

28:26.278 --> 28:29.302
We're investigators from the U.S. Office
of Paranormal Claims.

28:29.406 --> 28:31.491
I'm Carolyn Bramwell.

28:32.013 --> 28:33.575
We thought that this hotel was...

28:33.576 --> 28:35.558
...was deserted?

28:36.183 --> 28:38.790
You thought wrong, my dear.

28:39.832 --> 28:41.918
I've resided here for decades.

28:45.046 --> 28:51.300
The hotel was left to me at the demise
of its unfortunate owner.

28:51.302 --> 28:52.864
There are no records.

28:52.865 --> 28:54.429
I distrust public records.

28:55.472 --> 28:58.808
...and there are quite a few to back up the
government's claim on this property.

28:59.643 --> 29:01.311
You'll have to come up with some proof.

29:01.728 --> 29:04.335
Where've you been all this time, Chaney?

29:04.856 --> 29:05.899
In Bucharest.

29:07.984 --> 29:11.008
Endeavouring to do something about this.

29:11.112 --> 29:13.197
You haven't been in the
house at all before this?

29:13.198 --> 29:15.282
I only arrived an hour ago.

29:19.974 --> 29:21.538
You know what that is?

29:22.060 --> 29:23.102
No.

29:24.666 --> 29:28.837
My heart is not attuned to
the merriments of children.

29:29.880 --> 29:36.134
Please allow me to extend my hospitality
for as long as is necessary...

29:36.135 --> 29:38.220
...for your studies.

29:38.221 --> 29:42.390
I must insist on one condition, however.

29:42.391 --> 29:46.562
You must respect the privacy
of my personal quarters.

29:48.647 --> 29:50.733
But now... I must rest.

29:51.775 --> 29:58.030
I do not have the strength
of the more fully intact.

29:58.031 --> 30:01.263
I shall look forward to seeing you all in the
morning, and we shall become better acquainted.

30:14.713 --> 30:17.320
Well, somebody at the university
sure screwed up this time.

30:17.841 --> 30:20.865
Not necessarily.

30:20.969 --> 30:24.097
First thing tomorrow,
we'll check his claim on the hotel.

30:28.268 --> 30:30.353
Gee, this place is becoming a regular resort.

30:31.396 --> 30:34.419
Let us hope this one's a little more normal.

31:02.154 --> 31:03.196
Miss Bramwell?

31:03.197 --> 31:04.238
Yes.

31:04.239 --> 31:05.595
I'm Michael Kenney.

31:06.846 --> 31:08.409
We spoke on the phone.

31:08.410 --> 31:11.016
Oh. Of course. Please.

31:18.315 --> 31:20.922
I hope you have an open mind, Mr. Kenney.

31:23.007 --> 31:24.571
Are you always this cryptic?

31:25.614 --> 31:28.740
When I tell you what happened last night,
you'll think I'm crazy.

31:28.742 --> 31:30.827
Try me.

31:31.348 --> 31:33.850
My brother was killed.

31:33.955 --> 31:35.518
Murdered.

31:35.519 --> 31:37.082
You're serious?

31:37.083 --> 31:38.646
Quite.

31:38.647 --> 31:41.253
And this is his killer.

31:42.817 --> 31:44.380
But how could this toy...

31:44.381 --> 31:45.945
I don't know.

31:46.467 --> 31:49.699
But Camille might have seen this thing
before it killed...

31:50.637 --> 31:52.722
If only we had believed her.

31:53.244 --> 31:57.936
I don't mean to be rude,
but this is hard to believe.

31:58.978 --> 32:00.751
You can talk to my assistants.
We have it on tape.

32:04.192 --> 32:05.754
God, I'm so sorry.

32:05.756 --> 32:07.215
Is there anything I can do for you?

32:07.841 --> 32:08.362
No.

32:09.405 --> 32:13.471
Well, I guess I'll just go check the hotels
in town and see if anyone has seen her.

32:13.575 --> 32:15.138
I'm sure she's fine.

32:15.139 --> 32:16.703
Yeah, I hope so.

32:18.267 --> 32:19.310
Will you be all right?

32:19.311 --> 32:20.874
Yeah.

32:22.959 --> 32:25.045
- I'll let you know what I find out.
- Ok.

32:26.087 --> 32:30.257
Listen... why don't you wait till morning?

32:30.258 --> 32:33.907
I know you've been driving all day.
We have plenty of rooms.

32:34.428 --> 32:37.555
Yeah, I guess she should be back.

32:37.556 --> 32:40.684
All right, thanks. I'll go get my bag.

33:33.859 --> 33:35.945
Quit tossin'.

33:42.201 --> 33:46.371
I told you to go somewheres else,
if you gonna do that.

37:33.669 --> 37:37.838
You may think you got
the powers of hell on your side.

37:37.839 --> 37:40.967
...but you don't know who you're dealing with.

38:34.664 --> 38:39.773
No need to keep our presence
a secret any longer.

38:45.611 --> 38:52.910
We must keep the lighted window for our little
companions, so they can find their way home.

39:01.251 --> 39:03.858
I hope their harvest was a success.

39:06.464 --> 39:08.549
Soon...

39:08.550 --> 39:13.763
...soon you will regain your full strength.

39:22.104 --> 39:25.231
Und then...

39:25.232 --> 39:29.403
...we shall all be our old selves again.

39:49.213 --> 39:51.298
It's been cooked!

39:53.384 --> 39:55.469
It's useless.

39:56.512 --> 40:04.853
You must learn to utilize your
talents more conservatively.

40:10.587 --> 40:13.194
Where's the woman?

40:15.279 --> 40:20.492
So... another lost.

40:23.620 --> 40:28.834
Yet you are right to hunt outside
for what's needed here.

40:29.355 --> 40:33.004
Too much suspicion has been aroused already.

40:35.090 --> 40:38.216
But no more of this.

40:38.217 --> 40:43.431
Each time you fail, the result is more delay.

40:45.516 --> 40:49.374
And you get all weaker with each passing hour.

40:53.336 --> 40:58.028
The digeneral lobes you bring me...

41:00.634 --> 41:04.283
...and the timeless secrets of Osiris...

41:04.284 --> 41:09.497
...will once again animate the lifeless.

41:12.104 --> 41:17.838
But we have only a short time left
to distil the new fluid.

41:20.445 --> 41:22.008
Then...

41:22.009 --> 41:25.658
...then, think of it...

41:26.179 --> 41:34.521
...another half-century as Toulon's
miraculous stringless marionettes!

41:52.246 --> 41:54.331
And now, back into the cabinet.

42:17.269 --> 42:25.610
After decades, the scarab has summoned you to
this unholy place, and we are together again...

42:28.738 --> 42:31.866
...my enchanting wife.

43:57.363 --> 43:59.969
Margaret calls to me.

43:59.970 --> 44:05.183
No. It is a lifeless magic idol.

44:05.705 --> 44:10.917
Its rigid stare congeals the blood of men.

44:10.918 --> 44:12.899
I see the breast she yielded...

44:14.046 --> 44:17.069
...the blessed body I enjoyed.

44:17.174 --> 44:25.514
Fool! It is make-believe.
Your blood-guilt overfloods the land.

44:25.515 --> 44:33.856
Avenging spirits hover, waiting,
lying in wait for the blood-drenched killer.

44:34.899 --> 44:38.548
Faust, you are condemned.

45:28.074 --> 45:32.243
I am honoured by the presence
of the renowned puppet master Toulon...

45:32.244 --> 45:34.329
...as is all of Cairo.

45:34.330 --> 45:36.311
Accept my condolences for your
recent misfortune.

45:37.458 --> 45:41.628
We were told you had... something
to show us.

45:43.714 --> 45:46.737
The most sensational secret
the sands have revealed...

45:46.842 --> 45:49.969
...since the unholy
desecration of Ramses' tomb.

45:50.491 --> 45:52.055
Look.

45:58.311 --> 46:00.396
It's horrible.

46:01.439 --> 46:03.941
Its design reflects my taste.

46:05.609 --> 46:08.007
I offer you only its secrets.

46:08.737 --> 46:10.718
I have no need of them.

46:10.822 --> 46:15.931
The artificial enchantments of your
marionettes belong to the last century.

46:17.078 --> 46:19.684
Already the electrical
marvels of the present...

46:19.685 --> 46:22.292
...cast a cruel light upon their deficiency.

46:23.334 --> 46:26.775
Now, with the loss of your
most famous attraction...

46:29.590 --> 46:32.405
I'm an artist, not a sorcerer.

46:34.282 --> 46:38.974
The inattention of the children at your
displays indicate they would prefer the latter.

46:39.495 --> 46:42.102
And, with your charming new wife...

46:43.145 --> 46:47.314
...it would be a tragedy if you would
be forced to take up the life of a...

46:47.315 --> 46:49.296
...shabby carnival player.

46:49.400 --> 46:51.486
Andre, we might consider...

46:52.528 --> 46:54.509
Think of the children.

46:55.656 --> 46:57.219
Yes, think of them.

46:57.220 --> 46:58.784
Think of the children.

46:59.827 --> 47:02.955
Do it for the children.

47:11.296 --> 47:13.277
You're up early.

47:13.381 --> 47:16.509
If I'm not up by six,
I feel the day's wasted.

47:18.073 --> 47:19.637
- How did you sleep?
- All right, thanks.

47:20.680 --> 47:23.182
You didn't hear anything unusual?

47:24.329 --> 47:25.893
No, I'm afraid not.

47:26.936 --> 47:29.960
Anyway, thanks for putting
me up for the night.

47:30.064 --> 47:34.963
Michael, please let me know if you find
anything about your mother.

47:34.964 --> 47:36.320
Oh, of course.

47:37.362 --> 47:41.533
In fact, if you'd like to come along, you're more than
welcome. I'm sure you could use a change of scenery.

47:41.533 --> 47:45.704
Oh, I'd like to, but I really... can't.

47:49.353 --> 47:50.813
No, maybe I will go.

47:51.959 --> 47:54.045
There is something that I need to check.

48:00.822 --> 48:02.385
Good morning.

48:02.386 --> 48:06.557
I'm pleased to see that you've risen early.

48:08.642 --> 48:10.205
An old habit, I'm afraid.

48:10.206 --> 48:14.376
And a good one. My wife used to
say that if she rose after six...

48:14.898 --> 48:17.921
...she felt the entire day had been lost.

48:18.547 --> 48:19.589
Really?

48:19.590 --> 48:23.135
This day certainly has not been lost on you.

48:23.760 --> 48:27.408
...in its new-born gold, you
seem more than ever like...

48:27.409 --> 48:28.348
Like?

48:28.452 --> 48:30.433
Excuse me, I don't think
I've had the pleasure.

48:30.537 --> 48:34.707
I'm sorry. Mr. Chaneé. This is Michael Kenney.

48:34.708 --> 48:37.732
Please, excuse my
discourtesy, Herr Kenney, but

48:37.836 --> 48:40.860
...my hands are a source of constant pain...

48:43.049 --> 48:45.656
My health these days is... precarious.

48:47.741 --> 48:49.201
Maybe you shouldn't be smoking?

48:49.305 --> 48:52.537
Ja, I suppose it indicates a
weakness of character...

48:53.997 --> 48:58.167
...but I do really intend to
stop in my own time...

48:58.168 --> 49:00.670
...and you, young man,
should be most careful...

49:00.774 --> 49:02.337
...with your motorbike.

49:02.338 --> 49:05.049
Especially with my lovely guest here.

49:05.987 --> 49:10.678
We shouldn't want to see her injured...

49:10.679 --> 49:13.286
...or yourself unhappily maimed or disfigured.

49:26.319 --> 49:27.883
Charming guy.

49:28.926 --> 49:31.949
What is it he meant by calling you his guest?

49:32.054 --> 49:34.660
He claims this place belongs to him.

49:35.182 --> 49:39.457
That would explain the empty parking, huh?

49:41.438 --> 49:43.419
What happened to him, anyway?
Was he burned?

49:43.523 --> 49:44.565
He hasn't said...

49:49.779 --> 49:52.594
...but I have a feeling
it's even worse than that.

50:10.110 --> 50:11.570
Don't be late for supper, honey.

50:11.674 --> 50:13.655
We're having a great roast for your daddy.

50:15.324 --> 50:16.888
Be careful, baby, do you hear me?

50:30.963 --> 50:33.049
Die, Nazi scum!

51:05.892 --> 51:07.977
Come out of there, you coward!

51:22.574 --> 51:24.660
Cool!

51:25.181 --> 51:27.788
Wow!

51:38.214 --> 51:39.153
Do you know who I am?

51:39.778 --> 51:41.341
I'm the big star of the movie.

51:41.342 --> 51:43.115
I'm Indiana. And this is the set.

51:47.598 --> 51:49.683
What do you think of me now?

51:54.375 --> 51:56.461
What happened to your hand?

51:56.982 --> 51:58.025
Did somebody cut it off?

51:58.025 --> 52:00.110
What's under there?

52:06.366 --> 52:10.224
So do something.
I'm the director! Do what I say!

52:11.579 --> 52:13.664
Move!

52:15.750 --> 52:18.252
Can't you get up? Come on. Do something.
Now. Come on.

52:24.091 --> 52:26.176
Is that all you can do?

52:44.422 --> 52:45.464
Anything?

52:45.465 --> 52:48.072
No, nobody's seen her yet.

52:49.114 --> 52:51.721
If Cheneé does own the hotel,
he isn't found in any records.

52:52.764 --> 52:54.328
- Is he lying?
- Maybe.

52:54.849 --> 52:58.497
One thing's for sure. His arrival coincides
both with your mother's disappearance...

52:58.498 --> 53:00.062
...and death of your brother.

53:02.147 --> 53:03.711
And you think he's mixed up with that?

53:03.712 --> 53:05.796
I have no proof, just...

53:05.797 --> 53:07.778
...an idea that somehow, he's involved.

53:08.403 --> 53:10.906
Yeah, well. I've got another idea.

53:11.531 --> 53:13.095
I wanna show you something.

53:20.915 --> 53:23.418
I don't remember the last time I did this.

53:24.043 --> 53:26.441
It's not found under any microscope.

53:29.256 --> 53:30.716
What do you do, Michael?

53:32.384 --> 53:33.426
I write.

53:33.427 --> 53:34.469
Predictions?

53:34.470 --> 53:36.554
No.

53:36.555 --> 53:39.161
My mother and I are very different.

53:40.204 --> 53:41.247
I write Westerns.

53:41.248 --> 53:43.228
Cowboys?

53:44.375 --> 53:50.630
What I know about the real West
wouldn't fill half a page, but...

53:50.631 --> 53:52.716
...I've always loved wide open spaces.

53:54.280 --> 53:57.512
I've seen so little myself.

53:58.451 --> 54:00.535
I grew up as a competitor...

54:00.536 --> 54:03.142
...pushed myself into a government job,
because I wanted the structure.

54:09.398 --> 54:12.005
Maybe I need to rethink it all.

54:13.048 --> 54:18.678
Do something meaningful instead of putting
scientific tags on nightmares.

54:19.825 --> 54:23.057
But I brought Patrick into this,
and I've gotta find out what happened.

54:47.455 --> 54:49.540
All on your own.

54:56.839 --> 54:59.445
You have learned well.

55:05.180 --> 55:06.744
Oh...

55:07.787 --> 55:09.872
...my poor Jester.

55:17.692 --> 55:20.403
You need the fluid...

55:22.384 --> 55:25.512
...and we have so little left.

55:27.076 --> 55:33.332
Patience. I'll soon complete your new brew.

55:35.417 --> 55:37.501
But you...

55:37.502 --> 55:45.218
...you saved me from a
half-century of nightmares.

55:45.322 --> 55:50.534
That infernal sleep was not the...

55:50.535 --> 55:54.706
...dreamless escape I'd longed for.

55:57.312 --> 56:00.753
But you brought me back...

56:00.962 --> 56:03.047
...to Elsa.

56:04.090 --> 56:07.218
I promised her, she would return from death.

56:08.260 --> 56:10.346
From apparent death.

56:12.952 --> 56:19.729
Murder? My Elsa? Ha! I knew
they could not rob me of her forever.

56:23.900 --> 56:27.028
You will be repaid...

56:27.549 --> 56:32.241
...rewarded by becoming your
old selves again...

56:33.805 --> 56:36.412
...for another half-century.

56:42.668 --> 56:44.232
Then...

56:45.274 --> 56:49.132
...how happy we all shall be.

57:13.426 --> 57:15.928
We took a vote and decided
that you need to rest.

57:16.658 --> 57:18.639
I can't, not until I solve this thing.

57:18.640 --> 57:20.203
Well, it's almost eleven o'clock.

57:22.288 --> 57:24.373
I didn't realize it was that late.

57:24.374 --> 57:27.189
Michael found a bottle of brandy,
and he hates to drink alone.

57:28.023 --> 57:30.630
So, I'll take over here, ok?

57:32.194 --> 57:32.819
Where's Lance?

57:33.236 --> 57:36.884
He's getting his beauty sleep.
I'm gonna wake him up at two.

57:36.885 --> 57:37.927
Go on.

57:37.928 --> 57:39.491
Take a break.

57:39.492 --> 57:41.056
No, don't wake him up.

57:42.620 --> 57:44.810
Stay here till midnight, and then
I'll come back down.

57:45.227 --> 57:46.165
You sure?

57:46.269 --> 57:48.355
- Yeah.
- Ok.

57:58.260 --> 57:59.824
Hi.

58:01.388 --> 58:02.952
Hi.

58:08.165 --> 58:09.208
What did you find?

58:09.209 --> 58:13.378
Oh. This fantastic high-tech sound system
with all the latest.

58:14.421 --> 58:15.985
"Always"

58:18.591 --> 58:22.345
"I Wanna Be loved by You",
"What Wouldn't I Do for That Man?"

58:33.188 --> 58:35.170
After-dinner liquor, mademoiselle?

58:35.274 --> 58:36.316
Yes. Thank you.

58:49.350 --> 58:51.748
To mysteries solved...

58:51.956 --> 58:54.041
...and happier days.

58:59.776 --> 59:00.818
Do you dance?

59:00.819 --> 59:02.903
Not since my prom.

59:02.904 --> 59:05.511
I am... I'm terribly self-conscious.

59:06.553 --> 59:07.596
It's all right.

59:08.117 --> 59:09.577
Would you like to?

59:09.681 --> 59:11.765
I realize this might not be the best time...

59:11.766 --> 59:15.833
Michael, as a matter of fact,
it's a perfect time.

59:15.937 --> 59:18.021
Then please...

59:18.022 --> 59:21.150
...grant me the request of this dance.

59:26.885 --> 59:28.345
The music has stopped.

59:28.449 --> 59:30.534
Easily remedied.

59:52.951 --> 59:55.453
Do you remember this song?

59:55.558 --> 59:57.643
Yes, it's an old standard.

59:59.207 --> 01:00:02.335
It was Elsa's favourite.

01:00:07.027 --> 01:00:09.112
My late wife.

01:00:09.634 --> 01:00:11.093
May I cut in?

01:00:11.197 --> 01:00:13.179
It's your prerogative.

01:00:13.283 --> 01:00:17.766
Etiquette's curious concession to
the impossibly ill-mannered and impatient.

01:00:24.543 --> 01:00:25.795
My hero.

01:00:38.306 --> 01:00:44.562
Oh, that's too bad.
These things are hard to come by now.

01:00:49.254 --> 01:00:50.818
You'll excuse me.

01:00:58.117 --> 01:01:00.411
I wanna have a look in his rooms.

01:01:01.245 --> 01:01:04.268
Hey, look, get that idea
out of your head right now.

01:01:04.373 --> 01:01:07.499
Michael, I still feel that somehow he's
connected to everything that we can't explain.

01:01:07.501 --> 01:01:10.524
I don't care. This guy could be dangerous...

01:01:10.628 --> 01:01:14.277
...and if you suspect him of anything at all,
we should go right to the police.

01:01:14.278 --> 01:01:15.841
We need some proof.

01:01:15.842 --> 01:01:16.883
Uh-huh.

01:01:16.884 --> 01:01:18.447
No way. It's too risky.

01:01:18.448 --> 01:01:20.012
All right, if you don't wanna
help me, I'll just...

01:01:20.012 --> 01:01:22.827
Goddamn it, Carolyn, please
stay away from his rooms.

01:01:26.268 --> 01:01:27.311
Please?

01:01:32.524 --> 01:01:35.548
I just feel so alone.

01:01:35.652 --> 01:01:37.737
Let yourself go, Carolyn.

01:01:40.344 --> 01:01:42.742
Can't you see you're not alone?

01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:53.851
Marvellous.

01:02:59.064 --> 01:03:01.149
You've returned so soon.

01:03:14.704 --> 01:03:16.685
Perfect.

01:03:16.789 --> 01:03:18.874
We now have almost enough.

01:03:28.779 --> 01:03:31.595
We do not have much time.

01:03:33.471 --> 01:03:35.869
Our work...

01:03:36.078 --> 01:03:38.685
...must be completed tonight.

01:03:40.249 --> 01:03:41.813
You have been very patient.

01:03:45.462 --> 01:03:50.153
Always waiting for the
appropriate moment to harvest...

01:03:50.154 --> 01:03:54.324
...fresh human material.

01:03:58.495 --> 01:04:01.519
Never taking the easy way with animals...

01:04:01.623 --> 01:04:04.751
...or the already rotting dead.

01:04:07.879 --> 01:04:11.320
What amusing creatures that would make you.

01:04:18.827 --> 01:04:24.561
No one except the woman who
calls herself Carolyn will escape.

01:04:26.646 --> 01:04:31.860
As for the stupid young man
with the vain hope for her heart...

01:04:33.945 --> 01:04:41.139
...you, Torch. You will deal
with his burning desires...

01:04:41.244 --> 01:04:44.893
...in the most appropriate way.

01:05:47.973 --> 01:05:49.537
All spiffy clean?

01:05:50.058 --> 01:05:52.143
Yep.

01:05:52.144 --> 01:05:55.272
Come on. Don't take it personally.

01:05:56.314 --> 01:06:01.005
No, it's ok. I'm used to
guys hosing off afterwards.

01:06:01.006 --> 01:06:02.048
Good night.

01:06:02.049 --> 01:06:02.883
Where're you going?

01:06:03.091 --> 01:06:07.782
The only time I wanna feel somebody tossing
and turning in bed is when I'm helping them.

01:06:07.783 --> 01:06:09.346
And I need to check on Carolyn...

01:06:09.347 --> 01:06:11.537
...cause I took off at twelve,
before she came back.

01:06:11.954 --> 01:06:12.892
What?

01:06:14.039 --> 01:06:16.125
You mean there was nobody down there
when you left? - Well, she said that...

01:06:16.126 --> 01:06:17.167
Christ!

01:06:17.689 --> 01:06:19.252
I'm going down there.

01:06:19.253 --> 01:06:20.295
Let's face it, Wanda...

01:06:20.295 --> 01:06:22.276
...what happened to Patrick's our fault.

01:06:22.380 --> 01:06:23.421
We found the killer.

01:06:23.422 --> 01:06:24.466
We found a killer.

01:06:26.030 --> 01:06:27.489
Jesus, Wanda.

01:06:27.594 --> 01:06:29.783
Ok, look, I'll go down. It's my fault, ok?

01:10:20.104 --> 01:10:22.190
They have waited for decades.

01:10:26.882 --> 01:10:29.488
They did just for you, Elsa.

01:11:20.057 --> 01:11:25.790
No, my love. It was more than chance
that brought you here.

01:11:25.791 --> 01:11:27.772
Please, Mr. Chaneé...

01:11:27.877 --> 01:11:31.005
No need to prolong that charade.

01:11:31.526 --> 01:11:34.028
My real name is...

01:11:34.133 --> 01:11:36.114
...Toulon.

01:11:36.218 --> 01:11:37.260
Andre Toulon.

01:11:38.824 --> 01:11:42.994
Then you must remember yourself...

01:11:42.995 --> 01:11:46.644
...as Mrs. Andre Toulon.

01:11:48.208 --> 01:11:51.336
Frau Toulon.

01:11:55.507 --> 01:11:58.112
I've forgotten how it is to feel the cold.

01:11:58.113 --> 01:12:02.283
You must be chilly in that shell of flesh.

01:12:02.284 --> 01:12:06.455
That will be remedied momentarily.

01:12:12.189 --> 01:12:14.692
Do you remember this?

01:12:14.796 --> 01:12:16.881
We got it in Cairo.

01:12:18.445 --> 01:12:22.094
I was able to have it
sent here by your friends...

01:12:22.616 --> 01:12:24.179
...in Berlin.

01:12:24.180 --> 01:12:27.307
That was before they informed on us there.

01:12:27.308 --> 01:12:29.392
Linen...

01:12:29.393 --> 01:12:31.477
...royal mummies' wrapping...

01:12:31.478 --> 01:12:35.649
...will keep you warm enough
for the little time you have left.

01:12:36.691 --> 01:12:39.819
Just like it kept the
princess warm for centuries.

01:13:10.578 --> 01:13:13.183
You cannot imagine...

01:13:13.184 --> 01:13:15.269
...what it was like.

01:13:21.525 --> 01:13:25.175
For decades I waited in
the foulest of graves...

01:13:25.696 --> 01:13:28.615
...because of my promise to you.

01:13:29.554 --> 01:13:30.908
And now...

01:13:30.909 --> 01:13:32.994
...Elsa...

01:13:35.601 --> 01:13:37.165
Look...

01:14:27.212 --> 01:14:29.298
Elsa?

01:14:30.861 --> 01:14:32.425
Now, Elsa?

01:14:33.468 --> 01:14:35.553
Carolyn!

01:14:54.321 --> 01:14:55.885
Mother!

01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:11.524
The puppets...

01:15:11.525 --> 01:15:13.609
...they knew how to bring me back...

01:15:13.610 --> 01:15:17.259
...after the Nazis killed my Elsa.

01:15:17.781 --> 01:15:20.908
They needed me.

01:15:20.909 --> 01:15:22.473
They were growing weaker.

01:15:24.558 --> 01:15:27.686
And they used the last of their fluid...

01:15:28.729 --> 01:15:30.814
...to revive me.

01:15:32.899 --> 01:15:35.505
But then...

01:15:35.506 --> 01:15:37.070
...then I saw you.

01:15:41.762 --> 01:15:42.803
It made...

01:15:42.804 --> 01:15:47.496
...it made all my suffering worth it.

01:15:48.018 --> 01:15:49.581
No!

01:15:50.624 --> 01:15:52.709
No, I am not Elsa.

01:15:53.231 --> 01:15:56.359
Even if such a thing were possible,
I'm not her.

01:15:57.923 --> 01:15:59.487
Andre, she's dead.

01:16:00.008 --> 01:16:03.240
"Even if such a thing were possible?"

01:16:05.221 --> 01:16:06.785
What do you think I prove?

01:16:11.998 --> 01:16:14.605
I was able to watch you...

01:16:16.169 --> 01:16:17.733
...all you vile trespassers.

01:16:22.425 --> 01:16:25.032
I know how to get into things...

01:16:25.553 --> 01:16:28.160
...give them life...

01:16:31.287 --> 01:16:33.268
...temporary life...

01:16:34.937 --> 01:16:36.501
Well...

01:16:37.022 --> 01:16:42.235
...no more ghostly games of trick or treat.

01:16:47.449 --> 01:16:49.012
Tonight...

01:16:50.055 --> 01:16:51.098
...we take up residence...

01:16:52.662 --> 01:16:55.268
...in our permanent new bodies.

01:17:12.993 --> 01:17:15.079
To us.

01:18:24.415 --> 01:18:27.021
You see how easy it can be?

01:18:27.543 --> 01:18:32.235
Only a moment of pain and then... immortality.

01:18:32.756 --> 01:18:34.841
All will soon be glorious.

01:18:41.619 --> 01:18:45.788
You filthy swine!
You brought me animal brains!

01:18:45.789 --> 01:18:46.832
Animal brain.

01:18:47.874 --> 01:18:49.959
Well...

01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:52.045
...I'll just have to make the best of it.

01:18:56.216 --> 01:18:59.239
You see, I must keep my promise to Elsa.

01:18:59.344 --> 01:19:01.949
Your hard work has not been in vain.

01:19:01.950 --> 01:19:04.557
Of course, you may wither into dry wood...

01:19:05.599 --> 01:19:07.581
...but you've given me back my wife.

01:19:08.727 --> 01:19:10.290
Carolyn!

01:19:10.291 --> 01:19:11.855
Here, Michael!

01:19:12.377 --> 01:19:13.941
Here!

01:19:19.154 --> 01:19:21.239
Hurry!

01:19:22.282 --> 01:19:24.367
Are you still afraid?

01:19:25.931 --> 01:19:29.372
But we must make you drink, sweet Fraulein.

01:19:36.879 --> 01:19:38.860
We cannot waste our fluid, mein Frau.

01:19:39.486 --> 01:19:41.258
Only a single goblet remains.

01:19:48.035 --> 01:19:50.433
Stay back, fool!

01:19:57.211 --> 01:19:58.775
Come back with that!

01:20:13.893 --> 01:20:15.457
Michael!

01:20:21.713 --> 01:20:22.964
Elsa, stop! Come back to me!

01:22:06.708 --> 01:22:08.272
Do you need to go back to the office?

01:22:08.584 --> 01:22:10.044
No. It's all cleaned up.

01:22:10.878 --> 01:22:14.319
Now I just wanna get as far
away from all this as I can.

01:22:15.362 --> 01:22:17.968
They have the tapes.
Let someone else come up with the answer.

01:22:17.968 --> 01:22:19.011
I wanna know the answer.

01:22:19.012 --> 01:22:22.139
What happened to the puppets?
How was my mother's body moved to the attic?

01:22:22.140 --> 01:22:24.745
- Why was her throat slashed so long after we...
- Michael...

01:22:26.309 --> 01:22:28.394
...your mother's there.

01:22:28.395 --> 01:22:32.043
If somewhere there is something that walks...

01:22:32.044 --> 01:22:33.399
...it isn't her anymore.

01:23:05.409 --> 01:23:08.641
Should have taken a left at the crossroads.

01:23:12.499 --> 01:23:15.521
All right. Don't rattle your cage.

01:23:15.522 --> 01:23:18.963
We'll be there soon enough.

01:23:23.134 --> 01:23:26.992
The Balderston Institute for the
Mentally Troubled Tots and Teens.

01:23:29.911 --> 01:23:34.082
Good therapy for the little brats.

01:23:35.646 --> 01:23:39.816
We'll have lots of fun.

01:23:43.987 --> 01:23:48.678
And if anyone sees anything unusual...

01:23:48.679 --> 01:23:55.455
...well, who'd believe a bunch
of institutionalised delinquents?

01:23:55.456 --> 01:23:57.854
All right, back to the crossroads.

01:24:03.276 --> 01:24:07.446
We have children to enchant.
