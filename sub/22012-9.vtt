ADULT ADAM: Back in the '80s,

00:03.371 --> 00:05.406
before Will Smith was a
planet-saving movie megastar,

00:05.473 --> 00:07.575
he was a home-grown
Philly rap star

00:07.641 --> 00:09.510
known as The Fresh Prince.

00:09.577 --> 00:13.013
Together with DJ Jazzy Jeff,
they took the world by storm

00:13.081 --> 00:15.816
and made us all want to spit
rhymes and scratch records.

00:15.883 --> 00:17.851
(MUSIC PLAYS,
NEEDLE SCRATCHING RECORD)

00:17.918 --> 00:20.254
No one loved it more
than my brother, Barry.

00:20.321 --> 00:21.955
(SCOFFS)
Well, this is ruined.

(RECORD SHATTERS)

* There's no need to argue

00:24.992 --> 00:26.860
* Parents
just don't understand *

00:26.927 --> 00:28.762
I love how Jazzy Jeff
and Fresh Prince

00:28.829 --> 00:31.132
are always super funny
and rap about happy stuff.

00:31.199 --> 00:33.000
And yet they still have edge.

00:33.067 --> 00:35.503
I mean, these dudes are
basically identical to us.

00:35.569 --> 00:38.106
Really? I don't think
the mean streets
of West Philly

00:38.172 --> 00:40.808
are anything like the quiet
cul-de-sacs of Jenkintown.

00:40.874 --> 00:42.843
Dude, thing about it.
Fresh Prince raps

00:42.910 --> 00:45.446
about how he hates homework,
loves video games,

00:45.513 --> 00:47.881
and how all parents
just don't understand.

00:47.948 --> 00:49.183
That does sound like us.

00:49.250 --> 00:50.784
Shut up, shut up!
Here comes the best part.

00:50.851 --> 00:53.053
(RAPPING)
* Oh-kay, here's the situation

00:53.121 --> 00:55.956
BOTH:
* My parents went away
on a week's vacation *

00:56.023 --> 00:58.692
Dude!
Stop singing my part!

00:58.759 --> 01:00.794
Clearly, if we
were a hip-hop duo,

01:00.861 --> 01:03.131
you would be Jazzy Jeff
and I'd be The Fresh Prince.

01:03.197 --> 01:04.665
I don't want to be
the Jazzy Jeff.

01:04.732 --> 01:06.500
He just stands in the back
and bops his head.

01:06.567 --> 01:08.302
Everything falls apart
without the bop.

01:08.369 --> 01:09.803
Then you be him. You bop.

01:09.870 --> 01:10.971
I don't wanna to bop.

01:11.038 --> 01:13.006
What if we both be
The Fresh Prince?

01:13.073 --> 01:14.675
Wait, is that even allowed?
Can there be two?

01:14.742 --> 01:16.910
(GASPS)
Did we just become
a rap duo

01:16.977 --> 01:19.313
whose future's so bright,
we got to wear chains?

01:19.380 --> 01:21.048
That's for sure
not the expression,

01:21.115 --> 01:22.483
but, yes, I think we did.

01:22.550 --> 01:25.219
Which means we need Jazzy Jeff
and Fresh Prince gear stat!

01:26.487 --> 01:28.922
Neon... The color
of the streets.

01:28.989 --> 01:31.725
Ugh, too bright.
Here, try this on.

01:31.792 --> 01:33.561
What's wrong?
This shirt cost $20.

01:33.627 --> 01:36.063
This shirt is plaid
with a butterfly collar.

01:36.130 --> 01:37.665
What are you doing?
You'll ruin my rep.

01:37.731 --> 01:40.033
You're only 16.
You don't have a rep yet.

01:40.100 --> 01:41.935
Let's put these
clothes back, please?

01:42.002 --> 01:45.072
No.
You go to school to learn,
not for a fashion show.

01:45.139 --> 01:47.508
Here, try on
these double-knit,
reversible slacks.

It was December 6th,
1980-something,

the freedom of life
at college.

Well, sort of.
Hey, Erica.

Don't you "Erica" me, Erica.

02:12.200 --> 02:14.402

It's 2:20, and I'm starting
to wonder if you've been
attacked by a bear.

Are there bears here?
No.

Look, moms worry.
It's, like, what they do.

02:58.412 --> 03:00.013
Just pick up next time.
No!

03:00.080 --> 03:01.682
If I talk to her once a day,

03:01.749 --> 03:03.517
then she'll want to talk
once an hour

03:03.584 --> 03:04.818
and then once a minute.

03:04.885 --> 03:07.154

Hello?

03:13.927 --> 03:16.096
Murray, she picked up
for a split second

03:16.163 --> 03:17.998
and then hung up.
There's only one explanation.

03:18.065 --> 03:19.367
She doesn't want to
talk to you.

03:19.433 --> 03:20.734
Go to sleep.
No.

03:20.801 --> 03:22.670
She was obviously
eating a hard candy,

03:22.736 --> 03:24.104
and it got lodged
in her throat.

03:24.171 --> 03:26.874
And when she grabbed the phone
to call 911, she passed out!

03:26.940 --> 03:29.042
What kind of college has
hard candies lying around?

03:29.109 --> 03:31.345
You don't know!
There could be
a lobby with a dish.

03:31.412 --> 03:33.547
Are you watching that S.O.B.
Phil Donahue again?

03:33.614 --> 03:36.384
He did an expose
on choking hazards, Murray.

03:36.450 --> 03:39.987
Did you know that
hard candy kills more people
than smoking?

03:40.053 --> 03:42.956
That gray-haired bastard.
All he does is make you worry.

03:43.023 --> 03:46.627
When Erica lived here,
she was fed and clothed
and had easy BMs.

03:46.694 --> 03:48.862

going on, and it's torture.

was failing to reach Erica,

04:08.949 --> 04:11.151
my and my big bro
were brainstorming ways

04:11.218 --> 04:12.553
to reach rap superstardom.

04:12.620 --> 04:13.787
As you all know,

04:13.854 --> 04:16.390
Fresh Prince has what
we in showbiz call "It."

04:16.457 --> 04:17.858
Love him.
So approachable.

04:17.925 --> 04:19.693
My mom knows his aunt
and hears good things.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.762
The secret behind
Fresh Prince's success is

04:21.829 --> 04:24.264
his rhymes are always about
funny, universal topics.

04:24.332 --> 04:27.100
Example. Parents
just don't understand.

04:27.167 --> 04:29.169
Naked Rob,
do your parents understand?

04:29.236 --> 04:30.371
No, they don't.

04:30.438 --> 04:32.205
They said I should at least
wear flip-flops outside.

04:32.272 --> 04:33.941
Naked Rob don't do
flip-flops.

04:34.007 --> 04:36.243
Gah!
I'm super fired up
and angry,

04:36.310 --> 04:38.211
'cause they refuse
to understand.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.113
Which means
all we got to do is

04:40.180 --> 04:42.450
write a song that speaks to
every kid our age, too.

04:42.516 --> 04:44.084
Easy.
Let's do a song

04:44.151 --> 04:45.419
called Grown Ups
Just Don't Get It.

04:45.486 --> 04:46.887
That's kind of
just another way

04:46.954 --> 04:48.522
of saying Parents
Just Don't Understand.

04:48.589 --> 04:52.225
Okay, what about Parents
Just Do Understand?

04:52.292 --> 04:55.696
Yeah, but we flip it so it's
Parents Don't Understand.

04:55.763 --> 04:57.030
Oh, my God.

04:57.097 --> 04:58.432
That's just the same song
as theirs.

04:58.499 --> 05:00.200
Fine! Then double flip it...

05:00.267 --> 05:02.403
Children Just Do Understand!

05:02.470 --> 05:04.071
And what do we understand?

05:04.137 --> 05:06.206
That all parents
don't understand.

05:06.273 --> 05:07.541
We did it!
No!

05:07.608 --> 05:09.910
We just keep circling back
to the same thing.

05:11.879 --> 05:13.514

But we're coming up
with a multi-platinum
rap single.

05:15.949 --> 05:17.317
I do not care.

05:17.385 --> 05:19.252
But we need to record
a hit demo.
Don't care.

05:19.319 --> 05:20.888

a recording booth at the...

Why don't you...

05:25.158 --> 05:27.928
I literally do not care.
Go out and rap to the trees.

05:27.995 --> 05:29.430
Go!
BOTH: Fine!

05:29.497 --> 05:31.231
ADULT ADAM: In that moment,
our grumpy-ass dad

05:31.298 --> 05:34.267
became Barry's inspiration
for our new hit single.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.069
Wait! That's it.

05:36.136 --> 05:38.338
We're not gonna do

Oh. That's so true.

And brilliant, 'cause
your dad really doesn't care,

05:50.818 --> 05:52.653

And Jazzy Jeff
to listen to only

you want me to talk to Erica

a call back, and...

She's the coolest.

06:46.139 --> 06:48.041
Um, okay.
So, what's going on?

06:48.108 --> 06:50.711
Not much,
just...here in my home,

06:55.616 --> 06:56.884
I thought your parents
took your phone away

06:56.950 --> 06:58.251

07:27.247 --> 07:28.448
(WHISPERING) Say something!
Hello?

07:28.516 --> 07:29.750
Hello?
Barry?

07:29.817 --> 07:32.185
Did I dial you?
That's so weird.

07:32.252 --> 07:33.420
I don't even know
your number.

07:33.487 --> 07:35.088
What? No.
Geoff dialed me.

07:35.155 --> 07:36.389
Geoff?
Yep! Uh...

07:36.456 --> 07:38.425
Barry's here, too,
hanging out with me
in my house.

07:38.492 --> 07:40.594
JTP!
Can you guys
get off my line?

07:40.661 --> 07:42.129
I'm trying to call
the library

07:42.195 --> 07:44.397
to find out what things
rhyme with "Father."

07:44.464 --> 07:45.799
"Bother"!
Now get off the phone!

Hello?
Adam?

07:49.870 --> 07:51.304
Hi, Mrs. Geary,
is Jackie there?

07:51.371 --> 07:52.773
It's Erica, dorkus.

07:52.840 --> 07:54.207
Why are you at
Geoff's house, too?

07:54.274 --> 07:55.743
Geoff's house?
Yeah, my house!

07:55.809 --> 07:57.711
Go do nerd stuff
at your house, Adam!

07:57.778 --> 07:58.812
I'm panicking.

07:58.879 --> 08:00.480
Keep cool and
ask the questions.

08:00.548 --> 08:02.149
Uh, how deep
are you going

08:02.215 --> 08:03.717
with your Q-tips
when you clean your ears?

08:03.784 --> 08:05.285
Just tell me right now!
Pretty deep, bro.

08:05.352 --> 08:07.287
Not you!
Just stop, Geoff.

08:07.354 --> 08:09.456
I know you're in my kitchen
with my mom.

08:10.457 --> 08:12.092
No! No.

08:12.159 --> 08:14.728
I'm just, uh,
here at the Schwartzes',

08:14.795 --> 08:16.329
having tea with Linda.
Yeah.

08:16.396 --> 08:18.265
Our... Our lines
must've gotten crossed.

08:18.331 --> 08:21.835
Mom, don't ever
call me again!

08:21.902 --> 08:24.337
Bye, Geoff.
B-B-Bye, baby.

08:25.806 --> 08:27.775
Well, Geoff, you really
screwed the pooch on this.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.843
You know,
that cello actually
belongs to the school.

about our dad

08:49.062 --> 08:51.599
* He calls us morons
when he gets real mad

08:51.665 --> 08:54.034
* He doesn't wear pants,
and he sits in a chair

08:54.101 --> 08:55.135
* You know what I'm sayin'?

* Dads just don't care

here's the situation

08:59.106 --> 09:01.541
* Our dad has a problem
with flatulation

09:01.609 --> 09:03.977
* He doesn't care
about anything, for real

09:04.044 --> 09:06.513
* I got an "A" on a test,
and he said, "Big deal"

09:06.580 --> 09:09.116
* He has no worries,
he has no fears

* He hasn't seen a doctor
in 15 years

09:11.384 --> 09:13.721

and we need to cry

* He says, "You're ruining
this episode of 'Magnum, P.I.'

* Can't you see I'm busy and
don't wanna be bothered?

09:19.092 --> 09:21.361
* Sometimes I ask God
why he made me a father

* Now leave me alone
and go upstairs"

and throw around a ball

about his kids at all

We blew them away!

09:47.921 --> 09:50.057
Dude, I got to be honest.

09:50.123 --> 09:52.092
This song is
very mean and hurtful.

09:52.159 --> 09:54.061
Yeah. I... I think
what happened here is

09:54.127 --> 09:56.063
you two were egging
each other on in a vacuum

09:56.129 --> 09:57.397
and lost all perspective.

09:57.464 --> 09:58.732
But the good news is,

09:58.799 --> 10:01.034
you were smart enough
to run it by us first.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.569
ADULT ADAM:
That would have been smart,

10:02.636 --> 10:04.504
if we hadn't already
given our dad a copy.

10:04.571 --> 10:06.573
Yes. That is
what we did.

10:07.607 --> 10:08.909
What the hell is this?

10:08.976 --> 10:10.711

look who's watched

I'm a bad dad?

You say
my first and last name.

10:22.355 --> 10:24.925
You're literally shoving me
into the garbage.

10:24.992 --> 10:27.194
True, true.
We did do that.

10:27.260 --> 10:28.729
Come on,
it's just a goof.

10:28.796 --> 10:31.865
We bust balls, we have fun.
You get it.

10:31.932 --> 10:33.701
Ha. I get it.

I nap because I'm lazy?

10:41.308 --> 10:45.879
No. I nap because I work
my (BLEEP) fingers to the bone

10:45.946 --> 10:47.748
so you little (BLEEP)
can have

10:47.815 --> 10:49.817
your dumb (BLEEP)
tennis shoes

10:49.883 --> 10:51.985
and your expensive

Uh...I feel like
we should go.

No, you little (BLEEP)
need to hear this.

10:57.157 --> 10:59.092
ADULT ADAM: That day, my dad
did the one thing

10:59.159 --> 11:00.593
every parent wishes
they could do.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.262
He called his kids out

11:02.329 --> 11:03.797
for being
spoiled and ungrateful,

11:03.864 --> 11:06.133
pulling no punches
and speaking from the heart.

11:06.199 --> 11:08.736
For my dad,
it was a taste of glory.

11:08.802 --> 11:11.438
And if you remember one thing
from this conversation,

11:11.504 --> 11:12.605
let it be this...

11:12.672 --> 11:15.075
Hee-haw-hmm!

11:15.142 --> 11:18.511
It seems Dad cares
a tad more than we thought.

11:18.578 --> 11:20.113
Yeah.

11:20.180 --> 11:22.249
I kind of feel we should cut
his name from the song.

11:24.752 --> 11:26.653
ADULT ADAM:
Erica may have hung up
on my mom forever,

11:26.720 --> 11:28.155
but little did she know,

11:28.221 --> 11:31.591

always stays on the line.

Okay, we've got
the party ball, the Solo cups,
the black lights.

Now we just need a theme.
It's our first major rager,

11:38.031 --> 11:39.933
so we got to go,
like, stupid big

11:40.000 --> 11:42.035
so the campus knows
we mean business.

11:42.102 --> 11:45.939
So, I was thinking
"King Tuts
and Egyptian Sluts."

11:46.006 --> 11:48.742
Delta Fi just did "King Tuts
and Egyptian Butts."

11:49.743 --> 11:51.211

Cyndi Lauper dress ever.

I can't hear
what she's saying?

Get me closer!

12:00.587 --> 12:03.523
Is someone, like,
spying on us?

12:03.590 --> 12:05.692
Stay here and don't speak.

12:14.634 --> 12:16.870
Srini?
Why don't I hear voices?

12:20.473 --> 12:22.910
What's happening?
This silence is killing me.

12:31.952 --> 12:34.087
Hi! Sorry for the silence.

12:34.154 --> 12:37.357
It's 'cause Erica
started to, uh, sleep.

12:37.424 --> 12:38.859
Sleep? It's only 8:00.

12:38.926 --> 12:40.994
See?
You worry for nothing, lady.

12:41.061 --> 12:42.930
Anyway,
I'm co-hosting a party,
and I have to go.

12:42.996 --> 12:44.331
Did she get you
on her side

12:44.397 --> 12:46.333
by offering to let you
co-host her party?

12:49.803 --> 12:51.438
Srini, what is
she doing to me?

12:51.504 --> 12:53.206
Damn it.

throwing a party.

12:54.908 --> 12:57.077
And I'm spinning out.
We all got our stuff.

12:57.144 --> 13:00.080
Donahue did a show about
the horrors of college ragers.

13:00.147 --> 13:02.850
Did you know that a keg
can roll over a kid

13:02.916 --> 13:05.085
just like the boulder
in Indiana Jones?

13:05.152 --> 13:07.587
What should I do?
Don't ask me.

13:07.654 --> 13:11.291
The boys just wrote a song
about what a garbage dad I am.

13:11.358 --> 13:13.793
Oh, please,
stop overreacting.

13:13.861 --> 13:16.696
Now, where are my keys?
I got to drive to D.C.
and save Erica

13:16.763 --> 13:18.698
before Donahue
does a special on her.

13:18.765 --> 13:20.700
ADULT ADAM: While my mom
overreacted in a blind panic,

13:20.767 --> 13:23.770
Barry's eyes still hadn't been
opened by Dad's angry rant.

13:23.837 --> 13:25.205
What up, JTP?

13:25.272 --> 13:26.773
ALL: Uh...JTP.

13:26.840 --> 13:28.141
Okay, what's the deal?

13:28.208 --> 13:30.978
Your "JTPs" have been
low-energy all week.

13:31.044 --> 13:32.345
When your dad
chewed you out

13:32.412 --> 13:34.047
with those R-rated
Richard Pryor words,

13:34.114 --> 13:36.549
it, like, changed us.

13:36.616 --> 13:39.819
Yeah.
I realized my old man's
more than just a landscaper

13:39.887 --> 13:42.622
who punches holes in the wall
when the Eagles lose.

13:42.689 --> 13:44.724
He's a hero.

13:44.791 --> 13:47.127
This morning, as my dad
was leaving for his desk job
at the bank...

13:47.194 --> 13:49.562
I just hugged him so tight.

13:49.629 --> 13:51.064
I got my dad flowers,

13:51.131 --> 13:52.665
and he was like,
"What's wrong with you?"

13:52.732 --> 13:55.102
And I was like,
"I see you."

13:55.168 --> 13:57.004
And then he broke down
crying in his car.

13:57.971 --> 13:59.506
What is happening
right now?

13:59.572 --> 14:01.008
I'll tell you
what's happening.

14:01.074 --> 14:02.742
You have to apologize
to your dad.

14:02.809 --> 14:03.977
You guys are right.

14:04.044 --> 14:05.678
Our only choice is
to suck it up

14:05.745 --> 14:08.315
and do the mature thing...
Write another rap.

14:08.381 --> 14:09.816
You sure, Bar?

14:09.883 --> 14:11.818
Maybe we should just be
a normal family this one time

14:11.885 --> 14:13.353
and say "sorry"?
Never.

14:13.420 --> 14:16.289
Think about it.
What better way
to get us out of trouble

14:16.356 --> 14:20.193
than to do
the exact same thing
that got us into trouble?

14:20.260 --> 14:22.963
So we rap about the ways
Dad doesn't totally suck?

14:23.030 --> 14:26.333
I'm on it, DJ.
Drop an apology beat, JTP.

14:26.399 --> 14:28.368
We all really think
you should just say "sorry."

14:28.435 --> 14:30.370
Right now.
Okay.

did you invite?

through our wall.

wanna drink rum!

"Girls wanna drink rum?"
or "have fun"?

What? Ew! Gross.

you need to get down.

but go into full Bev Mode.

fell off of a dresser,

his whole life
with a comfort dog.

16:05.865 --> 16:07.734
ADULT ADAM: As Erica finally
broke through to our mom,

16:07.800 --> 16:10.803
me and Barry were ready
to bust out
our latest apology.

16:10.870 --> 16:12.505
Hello, Father.
We see you're enjoying

16:12.572 --> 16:15.108
your nightly snack
of Snyder's hard pretzels
and milk.

16:15.175 --> 16:16.609
However,
we'd like a moment.

16:16.676 --> 16:19.579
As you know, yesterday
some things were said...

16:19.646 --> 16:21.948
Mostly by you,
in a mean, shouty way...

16:22.015 --> 16:23.383
But we're here
to make it better

16:23.450 --> 16:25.385
through
the healing power of rap.

16:25.452 --> 16:27.287
It's fine.
Just drop it.

16:27.354 --> 16:29.256
"Drop a fresh beat,"
you mean.

16:29.322 --> 16:33.493
DJ Ad, play our latest video
for our hero M to the G.

(RAPPING)
* Oh-kay, here's the situation

16:37.230 --> 16:39.566
* We may have made
a few harsh accusations

16:39.632 --> 16:42.001
* But our dad cares about us
in many ways

16:42.069 --> 16:44.471
* When we go out to eat,
he's the guy who pays *

16:44.537 --> 16:47.107
* And he buys us clothes
and books and more

16:47.174 --> 16:49.476
* He'll even buy the stuff
that we break in a store

16:49.542 --> 16:52.011
* When it comes
to spending big,
our dad's no fool

16:52.079 --> 16:54.647
* That's why he put us both
in private school

16:54.714 --> 16:56.083

16:56.149 --> 16:58.451
BOTH:
* Our dad pays for stuff!

16:58.518 --> 17:00.953
ADULT ADAM: After those
super-kind rhymes, our dad
was sure to forgive us.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.855
Mm, no.
BOTH: No?

17:02.922 --> 17:04.324
The only nice thing
you can say about me

17:04.391 --> 17:05.525
is that I pay for stuff?

17:05.592 --> 17:06.659
What am I, a bank?

17:06.726 --> 17:08.027
Banks are awesome.

17:08.095 --> 17:10.297
They have unlimited money
and lollipops.

17:10.363 --> 17:11.798
I know what a bank is!

17:11.864 --> 17:14.167
All the tellers
are named Debbie.

17:14.234 --> 17:16.436
They can turn
your dollar bills
into coins.

17:16.503 --> 17:18.105
Can we stop talking
about banks?

17:18.171 --> 17:19.272
I'm good. I don't care.

17:19.339 --> 17:21.141
But you do care.
That's clear now.

17:21.208 --> 17:23.776
Look, I had a dad
who really didn't care...

17:23.843 --> 17:26.546
About me, my brother,
pretty much anything.

17:26.613 --> 17:28.515
I just hated him for it.

17:28.581 --> 17:30.517
When you guys were born,
I promised myself

17:30.583 --> 17:32.552
I'd do anything
not to turn into him.

17:32.619 --> 17:35.188
And if this is how you see me,
I guess I did.

ADULT ADAM:
We had insulted
our dad yet again,

17:42.595 --> 17:45.132
so Barry and I took one
last shot at saying sorry.

17:45.198 --> 17:47.300
Hello, Father.
We see you're enjoying

17:47.367 --> 17:49.569
your morning meal
of Steak-umms and eggs.

17:49.636 --> 17:51.471
However, we'd like
a moment of your time.

17:51.538 --> 17:53.140
No, damn it.
Move it along.

17:53.206 --> 17:56.176
Don't worry, we're not busting
any sweet rhymes this time.

17:56.243 --> 17:57.644
We're just gonna
speak from the heart.

17:57.710 --> 17:58.878
That sounds worse.

17:58.945 --> 18:02.081
Look, are you
the perfect father?
Not even close.

18:02.149 --> 18:04.817
You're way too loud.
You're constantly aggravated.

18:04.884 --> 18:06.219
You're super gassy.

18:06.286 --> 18:08.355
You once fell asleep during
a parent-teacher conference.

18:08.421 --> 18:10.390
You once fell asleep
at Thanksgiving dinner.

18:10.457 --> 18:12.759
You fell asleep
at a stoplight many times.

18:12.825 --> 18:15.328
You've got a real problem
with sleep, man.

18:15.395 --> 18:17.330
Are you done
with your apology?
No.

18:17.397 --> 18:19.432
You may be all those things,
(SLOW-TEMPO VERSION OF GIRLS

18:19.499 --> 18:22.435
but you're also
the most dependable dad
any kid could ask for.

18:22.502 --> 18:24.271
We know,
at the end of every day,

18:24.337 --> 18:26.773
you're gonna be there
in that chair,

18:26.839 --> 18:28.208
without pants on,

18:28.275 --> 18:30.743
making sure we
have food and clothes

18:30.810 --> 18:32.412
and whatever
stupid thing we want.

18:32.479 --> 18:34.381
We know you're always
gonna protect us...

18:34.447 --> 18:38.017
From the world,
from ourselves,
from anything bad.

18:38.084 --> 18:41.120
And no, you're not perfect,
but you're our dad.

18:41.188 --> 18:43.190
And we love you.

18:43.256 --> 18:45.192
Let's just forget
about this and move on.

18:45.258 --> 18:46.493
* My father yells

18:46.559 --> 18:51.731
* "What you gonna do
with your life?"

18:51.798 --> 18:53.566
You okay?
* Oh, Daddy dear

18:53.633 --> 18:54.734
Get out of here.

18:54.801 --> 18:56.369
Or we could give you
a big hug.

18:56.436 --> 18:57.770
Do not hug me.

Don't. What?

ADULT ADAM: Turns out,
we didn't need some epic song
to win our dad back.

19:09.949 --> 19:12.385
As for our mom,
she finally was able to see

19:12.452 --> 19:15.087
that perhaps she didn't need
to worry so much.

19:15.154 --> 19:18.157
Here, try Bevy's

You're, like,
the best mom ever.

19:24.997 --> 19:27.166
ADULT ADAM: In that moment,
my sister realized

19:27.234 --> 19:29.035
she really was lucky
to have a mom

19:29.101 --> 19:31.003
always waiting
on the other side
of the phone.

19:31.070 --> 19:32.439
Well, I guess
you were right

19:32.505 --> 19:34.741
to come up here and check in
on what an idiot I am.

19:34.807 --> 19:36.776
No.

* Wanna have fun
...then I'm sorry.

19:46.419 --> 19:49.121

to know that you're okay.

19:49.188 --> 19:52.191
So how 'bout this?
One call a night.

19:52.259 --> 19:54.761
All you have to say is,
"Mama, I'm good."

19:54.827 --> 19:56.763
That's it?
Just three words?

19:56.829 --> 19:58.765
Honestly,
that is all I need.

19:58.831 --> 20:00.333
I think I can swing that.

20:02.101 --> 20:04.837
ADULT ADAM:
Truth is, it's not the parents
that don't understand.

20:04.904 --> 20:07.206
It's us kids who don't get
where our parents
are coming from

20:07.274 --> 20:08.708
and how hard it can be.

20:08.775 --> 20:10.277

In the end, the best way
to be understood...
