WEBVTT

00:08.842 --> 00:10.635
- Whoo.
I think, uh,

00:10.719 --> 00:15.348
we packed a lifetime of travel
in the last two days.

00:15.432 --> 00:17.767
What a whirlwind, huh?

00:19.477 --> 00:20.353
Ahh.

00:20.437 --> 00:23.106
But, uh, I've had my fill.

00:23.189 --> 00:25.734
When Hazel comes back,
I'm gonna tell her everything.

00:25.817 --> 00:28.611
- Hello?

00:28.695 --> 00:30.238
- Do you hear something?

00:30.321 --> 00:31.531
- Dad.

00:36.786 --> 00:37.829
Dad!

00:40.749 --> 00:42.333
- Hazel?

00:42.417 --> 00:44.961
- Dad, it's me.

00:45.044 --> 00:47.672
Byron trapped me.

00:47.756 --> 00:49.841
I need your help.

00:57.599 --> 01:00.435
- You get that to Jasper.
He'll know how to turn it on.

01:00.518 --> 01:02.103
- And what happens
once it's turned on?

01:02.187 --> 01:03.813
- We storm the castle
and you end up being

01:03.897 --> 01:06.316
the hero who took down
Byron Gogol.

01:08.067 --> 01:10.403
Not ready to go home yet.

01:10.487 --> 01:13.364
It was lovely
to be out in the world.

01:13.448 --> 01:16.075
Together.
I liked it.

01:18.369 --> 01:20.330
- Me too.
I...

01:20.413 --> 01:23.792
wish we did it more often.
I would like that.

01:23.875 --> 01:25.251
- Let's start now.

01:28.421 --> 01:30.548
Let's go somewhere...

01:30.632 --> 01:32.801
else now.

01:36.763 --> 01:38.181
You know what?
Okay.

01:38.264 --> 01:40.225
- I wanna go to Montana.

01:40.308 --> 01:43.144
I wanna see where you grew up.

01:43.228 --> 01:44.979
To Dutton?

01:45.063 --> 01:46.648
You--you wanna go--

01:46.731 --> 01:48.483
you wanna go to Dutton?

01:48.566 --> 01:50.318
- Mm-hmm.

01:50.401 --> 01:52.612
The first time that you
brought me back to the Hub,

01:52.695 --> 01:54.906
you knew everything
about my history,

01:54.989 --> 01:58.535
but I didn't know anything
about yours, and I still don't.

01:58.618 --> 02:02.372
And I think
I might feel differently

02:02.455 --> 02:04.666
about going back to the Hub
if I know

02:04.749 --> 02:06.960
who I'm going back with.

02:07.043 --> 02:08.837
You know?
- I'm--I'm so sorry.

02:08.920 --> 02:10.505
Y-you're saying
you wanna go to Dutton?

02:10.588 --> 02:12.298
- Yeah.
- Like, now? Is that--

02:12.382 --> 02:15.385
- I wanna go.
No more secrets.

02:15.468 --> 02:17.428
Right?

02:17.512 --> 02:19.889
- Right--yeah.
Yes.

02:21.558 --> 02:23.351
Dutton--
to Dutton!

02:23.434 --> 02:25.895
I'll go tell the pilot
right now. Yeah.

02:40.118 --> 02:41.703
- So who's gonna be there?

02:41.786 --> 02:44.038
- Um...

02:44.122 --> 02:46.165
my dad, I guess.

02:46.249 --> 02:48.084
- And you
haven't seen him since...

02:48.167 --> 02:49.752
- I was 16.

02:49.836 --> 02:51.296
16.

02:51.379 --> 02:53.923
- You haven't had any contact
with your dad since then?

02:54.007 --> 02:56.092
- I don't know what
you really expect, uh,

02:56.175 --> 02:58.511
out of meeting my dad.
I just wanna warn you

02:58.595 --> 03:01.931
he will disappoint you,
'cause he will make sure of it.

03:03.391 --> 03:05.018
- People can change.

03:10.773 --> 03:13.401
- Dad wouldn't
have fancy equipment.

03:13.484 --> 03:15.236
Someone else
must be living here.

03:16.571 --> 03:19.073
- The mailbox says Benson.

03:20.909 --> 03:22.201
- It does.

03:22.285 --> 03:23.328
- Mm-hmm.

03:28.416 --> 03:30.543
- Looks exactly the same.

03:33.838 --> 03:36.049
- Well, come on.
Let's knock on the door.

03:36.132 --> 03:38.343
- Okay.

03:41.638 --> 03:42.680
- Maybe knock a little louder.

03:42.764 --> 03:44.724
- Okay.

03:57.362 --> 03:58.780
- Side window was open.

03:58.863 --> 04:00.907
Come on in.

04:01.658 --> 04:03.534
Come on.

04:06.162 --> 04:09.290
- I coulda told you coming
back to the Hub was a trap.

04:10.041 --> 04:14.045
We wouldn't be in this mess if
you would've just talked to me,

04:14.128 --> 04:17.465
instead taking it upon yourself
to roofie me every day.

04:17.548 --> 04:19.884
- You're right.

04:19.968 --> 04:21.511
I'm sorry.

04:21.594 --> 04:23.596
I was wrong.
- What?

04:23.680 --> 04:27.475
- Love sometimes inspires us
to do unloving things.

04:27.558 --> 04:28.935
- What, do you--

04:29.018 --> 04:31.020
you got time to think in there
or something?

04:31.104 --> 04:33.564
- I guess your husband
sticking you in a computer

04:33.648 --> 04:35.525
and taking your body
to Washington, D.C.

04:35.608 --> 04:37.443
broadens your perspective
a little.

04:37.527 --> 04:39.153
- You feel okay?

04:39.237 --> 04:40.822
You seem a little off.

04:40.905 --> 04:43.616
- I'm not okay. I'm trapped
in a computer, Dad.

04:43.700 --> 04:45.827
Jesus.

04:45.910 --> 04:47.203
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
wait--

04:47.286 --> 04:48.621
if--if you're in there,

04:48.705 --> 04:50.373
then who's calling
and checking on me?

04:50.456 --> 04:52.333
- Whoever he put in my body.

04:52.417 --> 04:55.169
Probably some Hub worker.

04:55.253 --> 04:56.546
Watch this.

04:56.629 --> 04:58.256
- I don't have
a chip in my head.

04:58.339 --> 05:00.633
Sorry to disappoint
the tabloids.

05:00.717 --> 05:02.677
I know that'd make
a great story.

05:02.760 --> 05:05.054
- All right, all right.
Turn it off. Turn it off.

05:05.138 --> 05:06.848
This whole place
is frickin' cuckoo.

05:06.931 --> 05:08.933
- I have a plan.
- Uh-oh.

05:09.017 --> 05:12.228
- It's gonna sound
a little brutal at first,

05:12.311 --> 05:16.024
but it is the only way
to get me out of here.

05:18.818 --> 05:21.195
I need a body.

05:21.279 --> 05:23.364
- You want me to--
to kill someone?

05:23.448 --> 05:25.742
- No, no, no, no.
I just need a...

05:25.825 --> 05:28.286
a living body
that I can borrow--

05:28.369 --> 05:31.164
temporary housing until
I can get my real body back.

05:31.247 --> 05:33.374
- What happens to that person
when you're--

05:33.458 --> 05:35.293
- Nothing.

05:35.376 --> 05:36.753
They just get paused.

05:36.836 --> 05:38.546
- All right, what--

05:38.629 --> 05:41.257
what do I have to do, exactly?

05:42.842 --> 05:45.386
- I cannot picture you
living here.

05:45.470 --> 05:48.347
- Yeah.
Neither can I.

05:48.431 --> 05:50.725
- It's different
than I expected.

05:50.808 --> 05:52.268
- Hell.

05:52.351 --> 05:55.772
- It's homey.
- I'll see if he's upstairs.

06:08.326 --> 06:09.827
- Turn around.

06:09.911 --> 06:12.080
Nice and slow.

06:16.626 --> 06:17.502
Alice?

06:17.585 --> 06:19.337
- Hazel.
Um...

06:19.420 --> 06:21.798
who are...you?
- Greg Benson.

06:21.881 --> 06:24.425
You wanna tell me why the fuck
you're in my house?

06:24.509 --> 06:26.969
- Aaron, put the gun down.

06:27.053 --> 06:29.472
That's my wife.
Put the gun down, Aaron.

06:31.182 --> 06:34.102
- He said
that he's Greg Benson.

06:34.185 --> 06:36.813
- That is my brother, Aaron.
- Hi.

06:36.896 --> 06:40.775
- And apparently he's been,
uh, using my name.

06:41.609 --> 06:43.486
- You weren't using it.

06:43.569 --> 06:44.904
- Where's Dad?

06:44.987 --> 06:47.156
- He's outside.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.617
Do you want to see him?

06:49.700 --> 06:51.661
- I'd like that.

06:52.662 --> 06:55.039
When did this happen?

06:55.123 --> 06:56.624
- You honestly don't know?

06:56.707 --> 06:58.835
- I don't. I don't know.

06:58.918 --> 07:01.212
- Drank himself to death.

07:01.295 --> 07:02.463
Not surprising.

07:02.547 --> 07:05.883
- Why didn't you ever
reach out?

07:05.967 --> 07:07.844
- Really?

07:07.927 --> 07:09.679
You fuckin' with me right now?

07:09.762 --> 07:11.013
You don't remember me
coming to you

07:11.097 --> 07:13.141
when dad was about
to lose the farm?

07:13.224 --> 07:15.184
Rather than talking to me
like a human being,

07:15.268 --> 07:16.727
you sent some jerk
to pay me off.

07:16.811 --> 07:18.688
But it turns out
it was actually perfect timing

07:18.771 --> 07:20.815
'cause poor old Aaron
was about to go off to jail.

07:20.898 --> 07:23.734
And don't worry.
It was just a misunderstanding.

07:23.818 --> 07:25.987
Turns out,
being Greg Benson suits me.

07:27.238 --> 07:29.490
- I'm sorry to hear about that.

07:29.574 --> 07:31.576
We'll be on our way.

07:34.370 --> 07:35.830
- Byron.

07:35.913 --> 07:38.916
Byron, are you okay?

07:39.000 --> 07:40.543
- He's not a good person.

07:40.626 --> 07:43.254
I don't know what he's up to,
but I don't wanna know.

07:43.337 --> 07:44.922
- We--we came all this way,
though.

07:45.006 --> 07:46.507
- Yeah,
and he can't be trusted.

07:46.591 --> 07:50.178
- You haven't seen each other
since you were kids.

07:50.261 --> 07:53.347
Right?
- Yeah, we got--that...

07:53.431 --> 07:55.057
It was a mistake coming here.

07:55.141 --> 07:59.353
- Yeah, but he's your only
family that you have...left.

08:00.813 --> 08:03.649
You don't wanna try?

08:03.733 --> 08:04.984
Please?

08:05.067 --> 08:07.862
- Guys, why don't you stay
for dinner?

08:09.071 --> 08:11.199
You like chicken?

08:12.283 --> 08:13.451
- So you're saying that humans

08:13.534 --> 08:15.745
are fundamentally
self-absorbed?

08:15.828 --> 08:17.747
- I'm sympathizing.

08:17.830 --> 08:20.208
An ego is a horrible cage
to be trapped inside--

08:20.291 --> 08:21.667
even worse than a tank

08:21.751 --> 08:22.919
- And with you knowing so much,

08:23.002 --> 08:24.712
is it hard with other dolphins?

08:24.795 --> 08:27.632
- The hardest part is everyone
in here's a boring shag.

08:31.886 --> 08:33.221
Listen, Zelda.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.183
You trust me, right?

08:37.266 --> 08:40.937
I've been thinking a lot on
what you said about Fiffany

08:41.020 --> 08:43.731
and Hazel escaping
through the tunnel.

08:43.814 --> 08:45.316
Are there more?

08:45.399 --> 08:47.818
- There are a few
underwater access tunnels

08:47.902 --> 08:49.237
I could show you.

08:49.320 --> 08:51.739
- As in, I--
I come in and swim with you?

08:51.822 --> 08:53.282
- No. We'll take my town car.

08:53.366 --> 08:56.285
Of course swim,
you daft wanker.

09:12.218 --> 09:14.053
Oh.

09:14.136 --> 09:15.596
Oh, God.

09:18.766 --> 09:20.434
- Is Donnie here?

09:20.518 --> 09:22.562
- Every time we break up,
he does this.

09:22.645 --> 09:24.397
Donnie, your freaky-ass

09:24.480 --> 09:28.276
Tinder grandma rebound pussy's
here in a nun costume.

09:28.359 --> 09:30.361
- Grandma?
Excuse you.

09:30.444 --> 09:32.780
- What the hell
are you talkin' about?

09:32.863 --> 09:35.741
Holy shit.
You're the unhinged nun!

09:35.825 --> 09:37.493
Come in, come in.

09:37.576 --> 09:40.121
- Mm, uh, I got your message.

09:40.204 --> 09:42.748
- So he's sliding in your DMs.
It's cool.

09:42.832 --> 09:46.127
- You ever been beat up by
a celibate, menopausal woman?

09:46.210 --> 09:47.837
You said you had info on Hazel.

09:47.920 --> 09:49.672
- Yeah.
Have a seat.

09:50.923 --> 09:53.801
A while back, Hazel Gogol
was outside my house

09:53.884 --> 09:55.553
and Byron Gogol
called my phone.

09:55.636 --> 09:58.472
Had me tell Hazel
that she was "made for love,"

09:58.556 --> 10:02.268
and she was looking rough--
blood all over her face.

10:02.351 --> 10:05.062
- I knew it!
That's more proof.

10:05.146 --> 10:07.315
'Cause she is
brainwashed now, honey.

10:07.398 --> 10:08.941
- And she's denyin' it
all over the news.

10:09.025 --> 10:11.402
- Plus, I think Byron's
got my friend Herb, too.

10:11.485 --> 10:12.987
We've got to help them.

10:13.070 --> 10:16.449
I have a lead, but I think
the feds are followin' me.

10:16.532 --> 10:19.910
So I need to borrow a car
that's not registered to me.

10:19.994 --> 10:21.662
- Mine's in the shop.

10:21.746 --> 10:24.999
But...

10:28.252 --> 10:32.006
Could we swap cars
for a few days?

10:32.089 --> 10:34.091
- Hell no.

10:34.175 --> 10:37.386
But for the right price,
I will drive you.

10:37.470 --> 10:40.348
Where are we going?

10:40.431 --> 10:41.849
- Montana.

10:41.932 --> 10:43.059
- Oh.

10:44.602 --> 10:45.770
- Ooh.

10:45.853 --> 10:47.980
- So who wants
to be my sous chef?

10:48.064 --> 10:50.524
Hazel, wanna pluck or shuck?

10:50.608 --> 10:51.942
- Hazel, do you--
actually, do you wanna

10:52.026 --> 10:54.278
call your dad
and just check in?

10:54.362 --> 10:55.988
I can help here.

10:56.072 --> 10:57.531
- Well, now,
that I wanna see.

10:57.615 --> 10:59.867
But, yes, I'll be very quick.

10:59.950 --> 11:01.118
- Yeah.

11:03.579 --> 11:06.123
- Well, you look the same.

11:06.207 --> 11:09.043
- Hazel thinks we haven't seen
each other since we were kids.

11:09.126 --> 11:11.420
- Still weaving
those tangled webs, huh?

11:13.047 --> 11:16.384
So does she know about--
- I'll tell her, eventually.

11:17.426 --> 11:20.596
I'm just asking you
not to say anything.

11:20.679 --> 11:21.889
As a favor.

11:32.650 --> 11:34.527
- Come on! Hoof it!

11:34.610 --> 11:35.986
- I'm coming!

11:46.372 --> 11:48.999
Ah, my fucking nose!

11:50.000 --> 11:52.753
- Lyle, you hit a wall!

11:52.837 --> 11:56.215
Let's try and find
a corner or a door.

11:56.298 --> 11:58.050
Oh.

12:01.804 --> 12:03.764
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Ah, ooh.

12:03.848 --> 12:06.767
- Oh, hey, Fiff. Fiff.
- Huh?

12:09.311 --> 12:11.605
What is this?
Where are we?

12:11.689 --> 12:12.940
- Another circle of hell.

12:13.023 --> 12:14.316
- Huh?

12:15.526 --> 12:18.195
- The pasture cube
has different landscapes

12:18.279 --> 12:20.614
with different mindfucks.

12:22.199 --> 12:23.659
Holy shit.

12:23.742 --> 12:25.953
The scenery change must have
disoriented the Dwellers.

12:26.036 --> 12:28.330
They're gone.
Look, we lost 'em! Ha.

12:28.414 --> 12:30.708
- I'm not sure how much longer
I can take this, Lyle.

12:30.791 --> 12:32.793
I am exhausted
and I am thirsty.

12:32.877 --> 12:34.336
- Okay.
Okay, okay.

12:34.420 --> 12:36.922
Come on.
I'll get you some water.

12:37.006 --> 12:38.757
Come sit down.

12:38.841 --> 12:42.428
- Take a few deep breaths,
go to a happy place where

12:42.511 --> 12:44.805
dolphins live amongst us
and go to cafes and shit.

12:58.152 --> 13:00.654
- You think this is funny?

13:38.442 --> 13:39.735
- Oh, no.

13:39.818 --> 13:42.655
What if that's
the imposter calling?

13:54.792 --> 13:57.461
- Hello.
- Hi, Dad.

13:59.964 --> 14:01.590
Dad?

14:03.342 --> 14:04.927
Are you okay?
- Yeah, hi.

14:05.010 --> 14:06.470
I, uh, can't talk right now.

14:06.554 --> 14:08.597
I got some chili on the stove.

14:08.681 --> 14:10.891
- Oh, okay. Well, I just wanna
let you know that Bangles and I

14:10.975 --> 14:12.768
are gonna be another night--
- Such great news, have fun.

14:12.851 --> 14:13.769
Bye-bye.

14:20.276 --> 14:22.444
- Okay.

14:38.335 --> 14:40.796
- How about a toast?
To family.

14:40.879 --> 14:42.590
- To family.

14:43.340 --> 14:45.259
- To family.

14:52.266 --> 14:54.101
- So who's Alice?

14:54.184 --> 14:56.270
- Alice?

14:56.353 --> 14:58.897
She's just someone
that we used to know.

14:59.857 --> 15:00.983
- Yeah.
- You know,

15:01.066 --> 15:04.028
you could be her sister.

15:04.111 --> 15:06.071
- Mm.
- How long has it been exactly

15:06.155 --> 15:09.116
since you guys
have seen each other?

15:10.159 --> 15:14.288
- Mom left when I was eight
and took Aaron with her.

15:14.371 --> 15:15.831
- Mm.
- Dad always complained

15:15.914 --> 15:18.626
that he was left with the runt.

15:18.709 --> 15:21.503
- Trust me.
You had the better deal.

15:21.587 --> 15:24.423
With Mom, I never knew where
I was gonna sleep at night.

15:24.506 --> 15:27.217
- Is she still alive?
- Don't know.

15:28.510 --> 15:30.512
Do you?

15:30.596 --> 15:33.807
- I looked for her once.
No luck.

15:34.642 --> 15:37.811
- Probably dead.

15:39.897 --> 15:42.316
That isn't our driver, is it?

15:44.735 --> 15:48.113
- No, it's, uh, Leroy Fish.
- He's still alive?

15:48.197 --> 15:49.615
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

15:49.698 --> 15:52.326
He used to give us hell
when we were kids.

15:52.409 --> 15:54.453
- He's still trying.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.331
Hey, Leroy.

15:57.414 --> 15:59.500
- What's with the fancy cars
up the road?

15:59.583 --> 16:01.168
- Don't know what
you're talking about, man.

16:01.251 --> 16:03.754
Bullshit.

16:03.837 --> 16:05.673
We know what you're up to.

16:05.756 --> 16:08.801
- And we are watching you.

16:08.884 --> 16:10.844
- Nighty-night.

16:10.928 --> 16:13.514
- Everything okay?

16:13.597 --> 16:15.057
- You know,
he shot your husband once.

16:15.140 --> 16:16.600
- It--it--BBs.

16:16.684 --> 16:19.561
I--I walked onto
his property and pop-pop-pop.

16:19.645 --> 16:21.855
- From that day on, it was war.
- Yes, it was.

16:21.939 --> 16:25.025
- We TP'd his house.

16:25.109 --> 16:28.070
We opened his livestock gates.
- You still mess with him?

16:28.153 --> 16:31.115
- Last week, I subscribed him
to ten fetish magazines.

16:31.198 --> 16:33.117
- Well, careful.
That might win him over.

16:35.035 --> 16:37.287
- Oh, look at this.
This is something, huh?

16:37.371 --> 16:40.874
All of us just
sitting here together.

16:42.626 --> 16:45.254
And I'm glad you're here.

16:45.337 --> 16:47.756
It's been too long.

16:47.840 --> 16:50.134
- It's good to see you too.

17:05.441 --> 17:08.152
What do you think
of the wallpaper?

17:08.235 --> 17:10.362
My mom thought
she was having a girl.

17:10.446 --> 17:12.281
- Whoa.

17:13.907 --> 17:17.619
- Wow.
This is amazing.

17:23.375 --> 17:25.419
- This was the inspiration
for the Hub cubes?

17:25.502 --> 17:27.713
- I don't know, actually.

17:27.796 --> 17:29.465
Maybe.

17:29.548 --> 17:31.008
It's so weird being back home.

17:31.091 --> 17:32.509
It's like
I'm walking through a dream.

17:32.593 --> 17:35.763
- Better than a nightmare.

17:35.846 --> 17:37.973
Night is still young.

17:41.185 --> 17:43.437
- Come on.
You wanna see my roof?

17:43.520 --> 17:44.980
- Yeah.

17:50.110 --> 17:51.779
Oh, my God.

17:51.862 --> 17:53.447
It looks exactly the same.

17:53.530 --> 17:54.948
- Mm-hmm.

17:59.661 --> 18:00.913
I built this radio myself.

18:00.996 --> 18:04.500
We didn't really
have TVs growing up.

18:05.542 --> 18:08.796
- That explains a lot,
actually.

18:08.879 --> 18:10.798
Just kidding.
- Mm-hmm.

18:13.675 --> 18:16.178
That's nice.

18:23.936 --> 18:27.439
- Why'd you change your name?

18:27.523 --> 18:30.067
- Change my name?

18:30.150 --> 18:32.486
Well, growing up,

18:32.569 --> 18:35.823
I always felt like I was...

18:35.906 --> 18:38.200
born into the wrong family.

18:39.493 --> 18:41.662
I always actually
searched for clues

18:41.745 --> 18:45.541
that I was adopted
or swapped at birth.

18:45.624 --> 18:49.586
And I spent so many nights
sitting on this roof just...

18:49.670 --> 18:54.007
fantasizing that I could

18:54.091 --> 18:57.719
someday be a completely
different person.

18:57.803 --> 19:00.013
- I get that, actually.

19:00.097 --> 19:02.850
I really wanted
a new life, too.

19:02.933 --> 19:05.686
That's why I married you.

19:05.769 --> 19:07.980
Why did you marry me, though?

19:08.063 --> 19:10.274
- I think I wanted you to...

19:12.025 --> 19:14.570
Save me.
- From what?

19:14.653 --> 19:17.155
- I married you because
I thought there was a chance

19:17.239 --> 19:19.199
that...

19:19.283 --> 19:20.951
you'd be able to help fix

19:21.034 --> 19:25.956
whatever is wrong with me.

19:32.337 --> 19:34.798
- Well, why have we never
talked like this?

19:47.853 --> 19:49.396
- Zelda?

19:49.479 --> 19:51.523
- I hope it's okay
I came here.

19:51.607 --> 19:52.941
I had to see you.

19:53.025 --> 19:55.152
- Yeah, yeah, of course.
You all right?

19:55.235 --> 19:58.155
- I can't stop thinking
about you, Jasper.

19:58.238 --> 20:03.035
I want you,
and I know you want me too.

20:05.120 --> 20:07.748
- I do.

20:07.831 --> 20:10.918
I want you.
- I want to feel your touch.

20:11.001 --> 20:12.336
Come swim with me.

20:30.228 --> 20:31.813
- You all right, honey?

20:31.897 --> 20:34.149
You were really thrashing
around in your sleep.

20:34.232 --> 20:36.401
- Uh, yeah, I'm good.

20:36.485 --> 20:38.779
Um...

20:38.862 --> 20:40.530
just had a strange dream.

20:40.614 --> 20:41.949
- Would you like
to talk about it?

20:42.032 --> 20:45.786
- No. I'm--I'm good.
Uh, thank you.

20:45.869 --> 20:48.372
Guess I'm just getting used
to being here.

20:48.455 --> 20:52.000
- I get it.
Transitions are very hard.

20:53.543 --> 20:55.712
Speaking of,

20:55.796 --> 20:58.799
can I help with that?

20:59.925 --> 21:01.426
- No, thank you.

21:01.510 --> 21:04.888
I'm just gonna try
and get some sleep.

21:06.431 --> 21:10.143
- Well, if you change
your mind, I'm here.

21:10.227 --> 21:13.271
Sweet dreams, Jasper.

21:19.736 --> 21:22.489
- Good night. I'll see you
in the morning, okay?

21:22.572 --> 21:24.741
- Where are you sleeping?
- Downstairs couch.

21:24.825 --> 21:28.662
- I mean, you can sleep in here
with me, if you want.

21:28.745 --> 21:31.164
- Yeah--is that okay?

21:31.248 --> 21:33.291
- Mm-hmm.

21:34.918 --> 21:36.461
- Okay.

21:40.924 --> 21:43.844
You have room?
- Yeah.

21:43.927 --> 21:45.804
- Good night.

21:45.887 --> 21:47.889
- Good night.

21:55.897 --> 21:58.358
- Does this bring back
high school memories?

21:58.442 --> 22:00.610
Did you ever
sneak any girls up here?

22:03.905 --> 22:06.783
No. I didn't.

22:06.867 --> 22:08.869
You're actually the first.

22:12.497 --> 22:13.957
- Well,

22:14.041 --> 22:17.878
did you ever fantasize
about sneaking girls in here?

22:21.131 --> 22:22.215
- Yeah.

22:59.336 --> 23:00.754
- Wait.

23:00.837 --> 23:03.048
Wait.
No.

23:04.466 --> 23:06.551
Lie back.

24:34.264 --> 24:35.473
- Herbert.

24:36.558 --> 24:38.018
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

24:38.101 --> 24:41.354
Stop, stop, stop!

24:41.438 --> 24:43.190
Why--don't do this, Herbert!

24:43.273 --> 24:45.984
- I'm sorry.
I gotta do this for my daughter.

24:46.067 --> 24:47.736
Herbert...

24:49.529 --> 24:51.198
You don't have to do this.

24:53.158 --> 24:55.118
- It's temporary.

24:55.202 --> 24:57.787
I think.

24:57.871 --> 25:00.415
It's happening.

25:00.498 --> 25:02.042
It's happening now.

25:07.714 --> 25:10.133
I'll come back for you.

25:27.984 --> 25:29.486
- Hey, Dad.

25:41.873 --> 25:43.750
- You okay?

25:43.833 --> 25:44.960
- Yeah.

25:47.170 --> 25:50.507
I could use a beer.

25:50.590 --> 25:53.301
- I can't believe
that it's you in there.

25:53.385 --> 25:55.929
- I know.
I'm sorry.

25:58.181 --> 26:01.268
This is so fucked up--

26:01.351 --> 26:06.189
- I mean, do you think you're
still gonna be able to, um...

26:06.273 --> 26:08.483
- Get back into my own body?
- Yeah.

26:08.566 --> 26:11.903
- Yeah.
I'm not worried about that.

26:14.281 --> 26:15.740
Oh!

26:17.534 --> 26:20.412
Getting into this body
was the hard part.

26:23.373 --> 26:26.876
You did that for me.

26:26.960 --> 26:28.586
Thanks, Dad.

26:32.215 --> 26:36.928
- Hey, uh, how do I know
when Hazel's body's you again?

26:37.012 --> 26:39.556
- Oh, good point.

26:39.639 --> 26:42.475
We need a code phrase.
- Yeah.

26:42.559 --> 26:45.729
We could use something
from your secret language, huh?

26:45.812 --> 26:48.481
"Smearzart rearzight?"

26:48.565 --> 26:51.860
- No, you're stupid.
- Okay, all right.

26:51.943 --> 26:53.403
You come up
with something then.

26:53.486 --> 26:55.196
- No, I'm saying
the code should just be,

26:55.280 --> 26:57.073
"No, you're stupid."

26:57.157 --> 26:59.326
- Oh. Sure.

26:59.409 --> 27:00.660
Okay, yeah.
I can remember that.

27:00.744 --> 27:02.329
- "No, you're stupid."

27:02.412 --> 27:04.164
Stupid.

27:04.247 --> 27:05.498
You're stupid.

27:09.419 --> 27:11.838
- Oh, hi.
Sorry, I didn't--

27:11.921 --> 27:13.256
I didn't see you there.

27:13.340 --> 27:16.217
- Yeah, I just--
I wanted to check in on you--

27:16.301 --> 27:20.430
you know, while, uh,
Byron's not around.

27:20.513 --> 27:22.349
- I'm fine.
Thank you.

27:22.432 --> 27:25.018
- You know,
you're really good with him.

27:25.101 --> 27:28.313
You only tell him
what he wants to hear.

27:28.396 --> 27:30.315
- What's that supposed to mean?

27:30.398 --> 27:32.942
- Well, the other one never
really figured that out.

27:33.026 --> 27:34.402
- What other one?

27:37.447 --> 27:39.741
- Hazel,

27:39.824 --> 27:43.995
you are not the first one
he brought to the Hub, okay?

27:44.079 --> 27:45.914
Things did not end well
for her.

27:45.997 --> 27:47.499
You need to get out.

27:47.582 --> 27:49.501
- What--
what happened to her?

27:54.839 --> 27:57.425
Oh, my God. Where is it?
- Where's what?

27:57.509 --> 28:00.220
- Um, nothing, nothing.
Oh, God, did he find it?

28:00.303 --> 28:02.430
I think he found it!
- You can trust me, okay?

28:02.514 --> 28:04.849
I can help you.
- Plane's ready, Hazel.

28:06.684 --> 28:08.478
- You're leaving so soon?

28:08.561 --> 28:10.730
What the heck?
You just got here.

28:10.814 --> 28:14.275
Why don't you stay longer?
Show Hazel more of Dutton.

28:14.359 --> 28:16.444
- She needs to go home
to see her father.

28:16.528 --> 28:19.739
Hazel. Right?

28:19.823 --> 28:22.534
- I love that.
- Come on, Hazel.

28:30.834 --> 28:33.086
- I'll take that.
- Thank you.

28:41.553 --> 28:44.556
So did you get
to know me better?

28:44.639 --> 28:46.516
- I think I did, yeah.

28:56.359 --> 28:58.153
- You missing something?

28:59.696 --> 29:01.281
- No.

29:37.734 --> 29:40.320
- All right, people!
Let's find the Hub.
