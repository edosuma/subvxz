WEBVTT

00:09.234 --> 00:12.378
You're listening
to Radio Saint Marie.

00:12.415 --> 00:15.938
It's just gone nine o'clock
and the weather outside is hot.

00:16.024 --> 00:17.376
Damned hot!

00:17.594 --> 00:21.799
So, kick off your shoes,
sit back and join me, Dezzie Dixon,

00:21.836 --> 00:23.408
for the next two hours

00:23.409 --> 00:26.400
while I play the very
best in reggae music.

00:26.681 --> 00:30.689
We've a bootleg recording from
before Bob Marley made it big...

00:34.365 --> 00:36.424
a surprise from Marcia Griffiths

00:36.425 --> 00:42.416
and a classic track from The
Pioneers's 1969 album Long Shot

00:42.417 --> 00:45.381
straight after these messages.

00:46.445 --> 00:49.364
You went to adverts late.

00:49.365 --> 00:53.408
Faith, honey, Dezzie Dixon doesn't
rush his links. You know that.

00:58.381 --> 01:00.356
Like you read my mind, Bunny.

01:00.489 --> 01:01.911
Yes!

01:02.866 --> 01:06.352
Mm, do you remember this? Found it
tucked away in the racks cupboard.

01:06.353 --> 01:08.396
- Mount Zion.
- Yeah, man!

01:08.745 --> 01:12.436
♪ One of these days ♪
♪ I'm gonna hear you say ♪

01:12.514 --> 01:15.360
♪ Come on, before it's too late. ♪

01:16.202 --> 01:18.314
Love that track!

01:18.702 --> 01:20.422
Got a new song to add
to tonight's playlist.

01:21.132 --> 01:22.448
Whatever you say.

01:22.924 --> 01:25.368
Bunny, I'm going over to Raymond's.

01:25.501 --> 01:27.423
- You hungry?
- Mm.

01:29.390 --> 01:31.095
Dad.

01:33.344 --> 01:35.722
All right, everybody, Dezzie Dixon here,

01:35.759 --> 01:37.822
taking you into the night
with some classic reggae.

01:38.727 --> 01:41.087
Hey, you know, officially,

01:41.223 --> 01:44.188
we aren't supposed to leave the
broadcaster alone in the station.

01:44.318 --> 01:47.096
Well, I won't tell
management if you don't.

01:48.367 --> 01:49.810
Now, before the news,

01:49.847 --> 01:53.802
you were listening to Money
In My Pocket by Dennis Brown.

01:55.000 --> 02:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:03.943 --> 02:06.950
If I could remember
it better, but then they say,

02:06.987 --> 02:09.970
if you remember the '70s,
you weren't really there.

02:09.971 --> 02:12.974
Good evening, Raymond.
What's your special tonight?

02:12.975 --> 02:14.510
Excuse me.

02:14.547 --> 02:16.923
What are you doing here?

02:18.431 --> 02:20.447
What the hell?!

02:21.979 --> 02:24.963
Faith, wait, wait, wait, wait!
Be careful.

02:30.842 --> 02:32.858
He's not there.

02:35.251 --> 02:37.358
The fire escape's been opened.

02:37.395 --> 02:38.717
Dad!

02:38.776 --> 02:40.466
Call the police.

02:43.951 --> 02:45.270
Emergency services.

02:45.369 --> 02:48.401
I want the police, please.
There's been a shooting.

02:50.096 --> 02:52.467
Dad? Dad!

02:54.939 --> 02:57.596
- The police are on their way.
- What the hell is going on, Bunny?

02:57.641 --> 02:59.877
Girl, I really don't know.

03:04.651 --> 03:06.434
We've gone off air.

03:13.918 --> 03:15.419
Lord.

03:16.280 --> 03:18.148
Oh, Lord!

03:59.943 --> 04:02.430
- Excuse me.
- Can you believe it, sir?

04:02.467 --> 04:04.164
Dezzie Dixon shot live on air.

04:04.201 --> 04:05.732
I was listening at
home when it happened.

04:05.756 --> 04:07.623
They think an intruder
got into the studio.

04:07.660 --> 04:09.347
The only other people
working at the station

04:09.371 --> 04:11.326
had just gone out to get some food.

04:11.563 --> 04:12.776
I'll need to speak to his colleagues

04:12.800 --> 04:14.572
once I've taken a look
at the crime scene.

04:47.077 --> 04:50.733
Good evening, sir. So, we have a
single, fatal bullet to the head.

04:51.181 --> 04:53.420
There's traces of powder
round the entry wound,

04:53.452 --> 04:56.155
suggesting he was shot at close range.

04:56.266 --> 04:58.720
8mm, maybe 9mm in calibre.

04:58.757 --> 05:02.724
Mm, and there's blood
splatters here and here,

05:03.124 --> 05:08.180
so I think that he was
seated when it all happened.

05:15.202 --> 05:17.429
I assume the door was the
killer's point of entry,

05:17.500 --> 05:19.866
as this window's locked from the inside.

05:19.992 --> 05:24.539
So, someone must have waited until
they knew the building was empty

05:25.232 --> 05:28.475
and then came in and shot poor Dezzie.

05:29.028 --> 05:31.616
- It's audacious, to say the least.
- How do you mean, sir?

05:31.653 --> 05:34.950
Well, the victim was broadcasting
live on air when it happened,

05:35.104 --> 05:37.507
thousands of witnesses hearing
the murder being committed.

05:37.813 --> 05:40.535
I mean, most killers carry
out their crimes unnoticed,

05:40.748 --> 05:42.003
but our guy or girl,

05:42.081 --> 05:44.519
they not only wanted everyone
to know what they were doing,

05:44.741 --> 05:48.176
but when and where they were doing it.

05:48.511 --> 05:50.076
OK, JP, let's wait for Ruby.

05:50.160 --> 05:52.618
She's rounding up the
people who found the body.

05:53.040 --> 05:55.044
Erm, Ruby's behind you, sir.

05:58.961 --> 06:00.663
What's she saying, JP?

06:02.352 --> 06:04.491
I have no idea, sir.

06:15.500 --> 06:16.687
Oh!

06:16.724 --> 06:18.296
They're waiting for you
in the staffroom, sir.

06:18.320 --> 06:20.328
- Great, thanks.
- You know, for a moment there,

06:20.365 --> 06:21.887
I thought you were ignoring me.

06:22.077 --> 06:24.483
I don't think there's
any danger of that.

06:24.624 --> 06:25.984
Thank you, sir.

06:26.021 --> 06:29.496
I understand you'd nipped out to
get some food when it happened.

06:29.663 --> 06:32.029
Yeah, we were at the
van across the street

06:32.066 --> 06:33.586
and we heard the gunshot on the radio.

06:37.058 --> 06:40.160
At first, we really didn't
know what had happened.

06:40.200 --> 06:43.041
Until we went in the
studio and we saw...

06:43.259 --> 06:44.870
Dad's body.

06:44.915 --> 06:46.072
I see.

06:46.109 --> 06:49.451
Nd the fire door out the back...
I noticed it was open.

06:49.488 --> 06:52.487
It was like that when we came
in after hearing the gunshot.

06:52.643 --> 06:56.277
I went to see if anyone was out
there, but... nothing.

06:56.314 --> 07:00.246
So, that must be where the
killer made their exit.

07:00.839 --> 07:02.299
Any idea how they got in?

07:02.336 --> 07:04.319
We leave the door at the front open.

07:04.738 --> 07:06.761
You see,
Dezzie always liked this feeling

07:06.911 --> 07:08.717
that it was like an open
house, you know.

07:08.805 --> 07:11.756
In case anyone wanted to
drop by and make a request.

07:11.793 --> 07:14.017
Or bring him a free drink.

07:15.624 --> 07:17.061
Can either of you think of a reason

07:17.098 --> 07:19.654
why someone might want
to do this to Dezzie?

07:19.764 --> 07:21.303
Someone he fell out with?

07:21.340 --> 07:23.211
An ex-lover? That sort of thing?

07:23.248 --> 07:25.351
Dezzie never really got close to
people, you know.

07:25.388 --> 07:27.811
The only things he really
cared about was the music

07:27.864 --> 07:30.161
and his radio show. That's all.

07:30.345 --> 07:31.882
I can't believe it!

07:31.919 --> 07:34.520
I'm sorry, sir. You'll have to leave.
This is a crime scene.

07:34.595 --> 07:36.807
Excuse me, Inspector,
this is our station manager.

07:37.078 --> 07:40.311
- Carlton Brown.
- DI Jack Mooney.

07:40.796 --> 07:43.584
I was just asking your colleagues
could they think of any reason

07:43.621 --> 07:45.912
why someone might want Dezzie dead?

07:46.002 --> 07:47.626
Any thoughts yourself?

07:47.758 --> 07:49.767
That man was a legend, you know?

07:50.190 --> 07:51.346
That he was indeed.

07:51.383 --> 07:54.174
I, erm, was on the other side
of the bay when it happened.

07:54.211 --> 07:56.759
You know, Palm Tree Club.
Local band night.

07:56.886 --> 07:59.242
Then my phone just started
ringing off the hook, you know.

07:59.388 --> 08:03.104
I see. Well,
it's good to know you have an alibi.

08:04.763 --> 08:06.202
Oh, one last thing...

08:06.239 --> 08:09.266
there was a table out there
covered in old electronics.

08:09.397 --> 08:11.731
Should there be a cassette machine?

08:11.995 --> 08:14.498
It's just there was a manual.
An old Marantz player.

08:14.535 --> 08:15.906
Yeah.

08:16.013 --> 08:18.613
Did anyone move it today?

08:19.742 --> 08:21.671
Is it worth anything?

08:21.929 --> 08:25.736
A couple of dollars.
Not even sure if it works.

08:33.195 --> 08:35.193
Evening, Commissioner.

08:35.234 --> 08:37.124
A sorry night for the
people of Saint Marie.

08:37.207 --> 08:40.578
Dezzie Dixon's death will be felt
in all corners of this island.

08:40.615 --> 08:41.688
I know.

08:41.769 --> 08:44.278
And, please, let me reassure
you, here and now,

08:44.362 --> 08:46.247
we will get to the bottom of it.

08:46.364 --> 08:49.294
Though... that's not why I'm here.

08:50.341 --> 08:53.439
I've had the chief commissioner
in Paris on the phone,

08:53.697 --> 08:56.236
and in light of what
happened to DS Cassell,

08:56.313 --> 08:59.447
they're sending someone
over from Internal Affairs.

08:59.510 --> 09:02.479
If an officer is injured
in a firearms incident,

09:02.516 --> 09:05.366
then the senior investigating
officer involved

09:05.541 --> 09:07.799
has to go under formal review.

09:07.836 --> 09:10.538
They think it's my fault
that Florence got shot?

09:10.673 --> 09:13.744
They just need to be
sure that it wasn't.

09:13.821 --> 09:18.329
Maybe while the Internal
Affairs officer is with us,

09:18.641 --> 09:22.072
it might be better if you, erm...

09:22.330 --> 09:26.755
- If I...?
- Are a little less yourself.

09:26.833 --> 09:29.809
But... I am myself.

09:30.764 --> 09:33.799
That's who I am. I'm me.

09:34.330 --> 09:37.201
- Am I not?
- Mm.

09:37.244 --> 09:40.497
Sir, if you're asking
me to show this officer

09:40.534 --> 09:44.051
what a strong team we are,
well, then I'll do my very best.

09:44.271 --> 09:46.274
Thank you, Inspector.

09:46.517 --> 09:48.614
Yes, Madeleine Dumas lands tomorrow.

09:48.690 --> 09:51.325
She's on the 7am flight from Paris.

09:53.260 --> 09:54.869
Sir...

09:57.060 --> 09:59.028
should I be worried about this?

10:00.038 --> 10:01.994
I sincerely hope not.

10:35.941 --> 10:38.380
So, what exactly
do Internal Affairs do?

10:38.417 --> 10:40.437
Well, they police the police, Ruby.

10:41.611 --> 10:43.871
So, they could arrest Inspector Mooney?

10:44.363 --> 10:47.811
In theory, yes, but I don't
think that's going to happen.

10:48.176 --> 10:49.960
That reminds me of the time

10:49.997 --> 10:51.762
I was assistant hairdresser

10:51.799 --> 10:54.089
at my Auntie Gardenia's beauty salon.

10:54.199 --> 10:56.105
- It does?
- Yup.

10:56.371 --> 10:59.660
Let's just say we made sure that
woman at the income tax office

10:59.697 --> 11:01.011
was very well looked after.

11:01.048 --> 11:04.474
She got the double deluxe
manicure and the facial for free.

11:04.511 --> 11:05.740
You see, JP...

11:06.975 --> 11:10.308
people show kindness when
you show kindness to them.

11:10.464 --> 11:12.681
It's exactly how we should treat
this Internal Affairs woman.

11:12.705 --> 11:15.417
Er, no, we should not, Ruby.

11:15.462 --> 11:17.393
That is totally inappropriate.

11:17.518 --> 11:20.035
We've got to be nothing
but professional.

11:20.071 --> 11:23.271
But the more they like us, the more
they'll write us a good report.

11:23.327 --> 11:25.623
That's not how Internal
Affairs works, Ruby.

11:25.777 --> 11:28.709
Well, it would totally
work if it were me.

11:35.108 --> 11:37.643
Good morning. How can I help?

11:37.940 --> 11:41.025
I am Detective Sergeant Madeleine
Dumas, Internal Affairs.

11:41.062 --> 11:44.416
You are? I thought you
were on the 7am flight.

11:44.495 --> 11:47.178
I was. I landed at 7am.

11:47.266 --> 11:50.767
Ah. Slight confusion there on my part.

11:50.867 --> 11:53.210
I'm usually a very punctual
man, I assure you.

11:53.282 --> 11:56.217
- Please, accept my apologies.
- You've been shopping this morning?

11:56.312 --> 11:59.755
No. No. We have a murder
case in full swing.

11:59.801 --> 12:02.544
I was just checking
someone's alibi at a bar.

12:02.654 --> 12:04.018
Got chatting to the owner, as you do,

12:04.042 --> 12:05.418
and he said he'd lend me some albums.

12:05.442 --> 12:07.374
I've really gotten into the
whole reggae scene since I...

12:07.398 --> 12:10.010
- Could we go inside, please?
- Of course.

12:16.226 --> 12:19.755
- Here's a desk you can use.
- Thank you.

12:21.661 --> 12:24.755
So, erm... how does this work?

12:24.878 --> 12:27.070
First, I will need to
look at all the files

12:27.107 --> 12:29.474
from the case when DS
Cassell was injured.

12:29.598 --> 12:31.709
- I see.
- I also spend some time with you

12:31.746 --> 12:34.578
and your team,
observe and assess working practices

12:34.615 --> 12:36.515
and then I'll make my recommendations.

12:36.672 --> 12:38.340
That all sounds very thorough.

12:38.377 --> 12:41.728
Oh, I'm sure you and your team
are extremely professional.

12:41.800 --> 12:44.570
♪ I'm just a lonely boy

12:44.607 --> 12:47.096
♪ Waiting for someone to lo... ♪

12:47.189 --> 12:49.072
So, team,

12:49.407 --> 12:51.541
this is Detective
Sergeant Madeleine Dumas

12:51.578 --> 12:52.879
from Internal Affairs,

12:52.916 --> 12:55.145
and Police Officers JP
Hooper, Ruby Patterson.

12:55.182 --> 12:57.501
- Welcome to Saint Marie.
- Thank you.

12:57.717 --> 12:58.850
Oh!

12:58.950 --> 13:01.624
It's the best island
in the whole Caribbean.

13:01.745 --> 13:05.476
Well, I look forward to
getting to know it better.

13:05.513 --> 13:08.533
- Thank you.
- Oh.

13:18.903 --> 13:21.517
Please, don't let my
presence stop you from work.

13:21.554 --> 13:25.490
No. Right. So, team, reports, please.

13:26.375 --> 13:27.982
OK.So...

13:28.404 --> 13:31.771
Erm, Officer Patterson and I
carried out door-to-door enquiries

13:31.808 --> 13:33.618
just as you suggested, sir,

13:33.792 --> 13:37.993
visiting a total of 37 private
residences and businesses.

13:38.072 --> 13:39.581
After extensive questioning,

13:39.618 --> 13:41.850
none of them reported
any unusual activity

13:41.887 --> 13:43.574
in the vicinity of the radio station.

13:43.611 --> 13:45.682
Although we did question Madame Touzard

13:45.732 --> 13:47.807
who lives in the street
leading from the station, sir.

13:47.831 --> 13:50.417
- Madame Touzard?
- Yes. She's my old headmistress.

13:50.454 --> 13:53.020
She must be at least
150 years old by now.

13:53.534 --> 13:56.779
Anyway, she reported
seeing a suspicious vehicle

13:56.823 --> 13:58.895
parked in her street
just before the murder.

13:58.932 --> 14:01.833
It was a blue BMW with
blacked-out windows.

14:01.870 --> 14:05.739
Thank you, Ruby. Both of you.
Very professional.

14:05.740 --> 14:07.434
JP, run a search on all the cars

14:07.471 --> 14:08.971
on the island matching that description.

14:08.995 --> 14:12.547
- Right away, sir.
- So, what's in the box, Ruby?

14:12.632 --> 14:15.460
The box? Oh, the box!

14:15.497 --> 14:17.164
You'll never guess what I found in a bin

14:17.201 --> 14:19.442
near the radio station, sir.

14:23.187 --> 14:25.781
The tape player that was
stolen from the murder scene!

14:25.857 --> 14:28.733
Someone must have realised

14:28.770 --> 14:31.222
it was worthless and just threw it away.

14:31.259 --> 14:34.162
They didn't think it was
worthless when they picked it up.

14:34.256 --> 14:38.467
Well, let's get it checked for prints.
And well done.

14:38.590 --> 14:41.819
Day one... couple of solid
leads already. Excellent.

14:42.450 --> 14:44.991
I'm just going to put
this new information

14:45.028 --> 14:48.300
onto our investigation database.

14:58.005 --> 15:01.367
Sir, the radio station
e-mailed over the recording

15:01.404 --> 15:03.751
- of Dezzie's broadcast from last night.
- Great stuff.

15:03.788 --> 15:06.418
Be good to hear it again,
see if there's anything we missed.

15:06.505 --> 15:08.812
Any little audio clues
that might help us work out

15:08.849 --> 15:12.230
who fired the gun and killed Dezzie.

15:34.175 --> 15:37.304
Or would,
if I could remember it better,

15:37.341 --> 15:39.667
but then they say,
if you remember the '70s,

15:39.704 --> 15:41.425
you weren't really there.

15:45.479 --> 15:47.338
Excuse me, wha...

15:47.397 --> 15:50.345
What are you doing here?

15:51.408 --> 15:52.682
Get it to the lab.

15:52.769 --> 15:55.588
- See if they can enhance it in any way.
- Yes, sir.

15:55.658 --> 15:59.593
Our victim...
the legendary DJ Dezzie Dixon,

15:59.648 --> 16:03.070
an incredibly well-known face,
or rather voice, on the island.

16:03.299 --> 16:06.554
No enemies or spurned
ex-partners that we know about.

16:06.591 --> 16:09.125
I suggest we start with his
colleagues at the radio station.

16:09.162 --> 16:11.445
Even though both Bunny and Faith

16:11.482 --> 16:13.366
were at the food truck
when the shots were fired?

16:13.390 --> 16:15.795
Well, we have to start somewhere, Ruby.

16:15.981 --> 16:19.084
OK, well, I haven't got
everything back yet, sir,

16:19.185 --> 16:21.736
but regarding Mr Hicks...
he lives on his own,

16:21.784 --> 16:23.587
has never been in trouble with the law

16:23.677 --> 16:26.771
and has worked at the radio
station for nearly 20 years.

16:26.880 --> 16:29.939
As for Faith Butler,
I've got next to nothing on her, sir.

16:29.976 --> 16:32.594
Is she married?
Her surname is different to her dad's.

16:32.631 --> 16:33.708
That's what I mean, sir.

16:33.745 --> 16:37.517
I can't find anything...
no registered address, no tax code.

16:37.653 --> 16:39.351
All I've got is multiple cautions

16:39.391 --> 16:41.791
for shoplifting on Barbados
when she was younger.

16:41.894 --> 16:44.775
- Let's get the police file sent over.
- Already on it, sir.

16:44.877 --> 16:48.253
And this chap...
Carlton Brown, station manager.

16:48.316 --> 16:49.902
OK. Mr Brown.

16:49.972 --> 16:52.894
He's married. He's got two
kids, both at private school.

16:52.931 --> 16:56.391
Was hired last year to take Radio
Saint Marie in a new direction

16:56.428 --> 16:57.770
and attract younger listeners.

16:57.807 --> 17:00.732
I just interviewed the owner of
the Palm Tree Club this morning.

17:00.769 --> 17:03.129
According to him, his alibi stands.

17:03.300 --> 17:05.180
Excuse me, Inspector.
Can I interrupt you there?

17:05.223 --> 17:07.986
- Of course. Please.
- If you have witnesses

17:08.022 --> 17:10.747
confirming that all
these people have alibis

17:10.784 --> 17:14.077
at the time of the shooting,
why are you not discounting them?

17:14.213 --> 17:17.406
Well, you see,
as my Uncle Kenny used to say,

17:17.515 --> 17:19.671
never let the tail wag the dog.

17:20.640 --> 17:23.056
I was at school with a fella
called Charlie O'Brien.

17:23.257 --> 17:25.829
This girl Maeve,
she accused him of peeking at her

17:25.867 --> 17:28.914
while she was having a wee behind
a tree in Ballyrafton Woods.

17:29.081 --> 17:30.863
Now, the thing is there was 11 of us

17:30.900 --> 17:32.641
who could swear, on that day,

17:32.707 --> 17:34.582
Charlie was visiting his Auntie Bridget

17:34.619 --> 17:37.071
37 miles away in Wexford Town...

17:37.108 --> 17:38.560
Perfect alibi.

17:38.609 --> 17:41.883
Until you learn that Charlie
gave each of us a pound

17:41.920 --> 17:43.469
to provide him with that alibi,

17:43.506 --> 17:45.775
and the truth is he was guilty as hell.

17:46.107 --> 17:48.414
Does that answer your
question, Sergeant?

17:48.520 --> 17:50.425
I'm not sure.

17:51.776 --> 17:53.830
JP, I think we should
visit Dezzie's house,

17:53.867 --> 17:55.502
see what turns up there.

17:55.603 --> 17:57.583
Yes, sir.

18:11.478 --> 18:14.439
That is a damn fine
collection of records,

18:14.573 --> 18:17.547
and all original vinyl recordings.

18:18.800 --> 18:21.002
Sweet Jane! Would you look at this?

18:21.039 --> 18:24.245
It's Bob Marley and the Wailers...
the live album from 1975.

18:24.282 --> 18:27.225
Signed by all the members of the
band, including Marley himself.

18:27.262 --> 18:28.771
Yeah, that's very good, sir,

18:29.111 --> 18:30.914
but don't you think that maybe

18:30.951 --> 18:33.349
you should leave the
records alone for a bit?

18:37.157 --> 18:38.303
JP...

18:38.372 --> 18:40.839
what do you notice about these photos?

18:40.998 --> 18:42.611
Erm...

18:42.953 --> 18:45.459
that they're all work, not family.

18:45.737 --> 18:47.572
More specifically,
there's not a single one

18:47.609 --> 18:49.823
of Dezzie with his daughter Faith.

18:50.169 --> 18:52.605
No pictures of Faith graduating,

18:52.792 --> 18:55.795
playing the clarinet, riding a pony.

18:55.930 --> 18:59.430
I mean, what kind of dad
has this many photos,

18:59.531 --> 19:01.776
but not a single one
of his own daughter?

19:03.451 --> 19:05.107
OK. No, no, that's great.

19:05.144 --> 19:07.352
All right, thank you very much.
OK, bye-bye.

19:07.551 --> 19:09.592
So, immigration files show

19:09.629 --> 19:11.894
that Faith Butler had
never visited Saint Marie

19:11.931 --> 19:13.356
until four months ago.

19:13.433 --> 19:14.713
As far as I can tell, sir,

19:14.777 --> 19:17.488
her and Dezzie were total
strangers until then.

19:17.566 --> 19:19.254
I think I know why she came here.

19:19.785 --> 19:21.466
Found these in a desk drawer.

19:21.568 --> 19:23.911
Faith's mum took her own
life five months ago.

19:24.068 --> 19:26.474
Her mother was an alcoholic,
suffered from depression,

19:26.511 --> 19:27.873
and right until the very end,

19:27.910 --> 19:30.861
the poor woman blamed
Dezzie for her problems.

19:33.970 --> 19:37.618
I did media and communication
studies at college.

19:37.812 --> 19:39.819
Passed with distinction.

19:40.189 --> 19:45.329
That's when Mum sat me down and told
me I was Dezzie Dixon's daughter.

19:45.505 --> 19:49.525
That's where I got it from...
the interest in TV and radio.

19:53.905 --> 19:56.407
It was me who found her.

19:57.736 --> 20:00.103
And a few weeks later,
you came here to Saint Marie.

20:00.296 --> 20:02.751
I just felt so alone after.

20:03.259 --> 20:08.321
But I realised I had a dad,
so I got in touch with Dezzie,

20:08.470 --> 20:10.923
told him who I was
and what had happened.

20:11.248 --> 20:13.231
How did you get on when you met?

20:13.423 --> 20:18.345
We were both nervous at
first, but it was good.

20:18.514 --> 20:20.466
It was better than good.

20:22.110 --> 20:24.673
And did you spend much
time together outside work?

20:25.369 --> 20:27.860
He didn't really spend
much time with anyone.

20:27.930 --> 20:31.566
He projected this image of being
the great Dezzie Dixon, but...

20:32.142 --> 20:34.103
I think he was quite sad.

20:37.462 --> 20:41.423
You know, Faith,
when I found out about your mum,

20:41.501 --> 20:43.759
I'll be honest with
you, part of me wondered

20:44.095 --> 20:46.345
if you'd come to Saint
Marie to confront your dad.

20:46.603 --> 20:48.212
You think I killed my own father?

20:48.260 --> 20:50.837
Well, you have to admit,
it's a fair question.

20:51.744 --> 20:55.384
I was across the road buying
food when it happened.

20:55.751 --> 20:58.032
How can you even say that?

20:58.149 --> 21:00.156
I loved my dad.

21:00.353 --> 21:01.984
I know I only knew him for a few months,

21:02.020 --> 21:04.337
but the connection we had was real.

21:04.407 --> 21:09.782
Ask anyone. I loved him and he loved me.

21:16.734 --> 21:19.646
- JP, you're back.
- Yes.

21:28.994 --> 21:30.684
Did you buy her that cake?

21:30.721 --> 21:32.558
I don't know what you're talking about.

21:33.019 --> 21:35.941
Excuse me. Where is your custody record?

21:36.115 --> 21:39.707
- It's in the custody desk by the cells.
- Thank you.

21:42.105 --> 21:45.014
- We need to loosen her up a bit.
- You can't loosen her up.

21:45.051 --> 21:47.262
- She's Internal Affairs!
- Sure you can.

21:49.457 --> 21:50.972
What are you doing?

21:51.371 --> 21:53.605
Trying to create a relaxed vibe.

21:53.646 --> 21:55.888
You can't do that. It's evidence.

21:55.925 --> 21:58.139
Oh, don't worry.
I've already finished processing it.

21:58.176 --> 22:01.178
It's a police station.

22:01.215 --> 22:02.379
You can't play music.

22:02.416 --> 22:04.759
Oh, I know, JP,
but it's a friendly police station.

22:05.035 --> 22:07.574
What is that music?

22:07.683 --> 22:08.990
Er... It's, erm...

22:09.027 --> 22:12.943
- It's evidence, Sarge. Oh.
- I'll tell you what it is.

22:12.980 --> 22:16.629
If I'm not greatly mistaken,
it's Samfie Man by The Pioneers.

22:16.740 --> 22:21.027
- It sure is, sir!
- If you ask me, it's the bee's knees.

22:32.841 --> 22:35.352
Well, that's got the old ticker pumping.

22:38.994 --> 22:41.771
Is that the...
the tape that was in the tape machine?

22:41.858 --> 22:43.285
Yes, sir. I dusted for prints,

22:43.322 --> 22:45.439
but I haven't had a chance
to upload on to the computer.

22:45.463 --> 22:48.129
Well, let me know if you get a match.
Anything else?

22:48.166 --> 22:50.614
Ooh, yes, I know who owns the blue BMW

22:50.651 --> 22:52.299
Madame Touzard saw in her street

22:52.336 --> 22:53.468
- the night of the murder.
- Oh?

22:53.492 --> 22:56.612
Yes, I spoke with my friend who works at
the vehicle licensing office, Enrique.

22:56.666 --> 22:59.244
Him and I had a fling a few years back.

22:59.283 --> 23:02.934
Needless to say, it wasn't exactly what
you would call fireworks because...

23:02.971 --> 23:06.283
And what did Enrique say
about the blue BMW, Ruby?

23:06.399 --> 23:07.681
Oh,

23:07.790 --> 23:11.171
He said it was owned by the
station manager, Carlton Brown.

23:11.221 --> 23:13.949
Well, why would Carlton Brown
be parked near the radio station

23:13.986 --> 23:15.981
when he told us he was
at the Palm Tree Club?

23:16.018 --> 23:18.604
- Shall I give him a call, sir?
- Yes. Why don't you?

23:18.792 --> 23:21.692
Ah! This keeps happening.

23:21.729 --> 23:24.190
There is something sticky
on some of these pages.

23:24.227 --> 23:26.405
Oh, yeah, sorry about that.
That's Harry.

23:26.713 --> 23:28.759
He walked through some jam
and then across my notes.

23:28.838 --> 23:30.572
- Harry?
- Yeah, we live together.

23:30.634 --> 23:32.406
And to be honest with you,
if he's not in the jam,

23:32.430 --> 23:34.457
he's in the sock drawer
doing his business.

23:35.009 --> 23:36.672
- He's a lizard.
- Excuse me?

23:36.760 --> 23:38.199
Harry... he's a pet lizard.

23:38.236 --> 23:40.012
He's a little beggar, that's what he is!

23:40.049 --> 23:41.705
Right, thank you very much.

23:41.768 --> 23:44.229
JP, what did Carlton
have to say for himself?

23:44.266 --> 23:46.854
So, he says sometimes he
parks near the station

23:46.891 --> 23:49.588
because that's where he can get space.
And he knew he'd be drinking

23:49.625 --> 23:52.080
so he left his car behind
and walked to the club.

23:52.260 --> 23:54.494
Fair enough. That's very sensible.

23:54.588 --> 23:59.145
All of which means that
our mystery blue BMW...

23:59.182 --> 24:01.763
not quite the mystery after all.

24:01.998 --> 24:04.682
But what we're still
left pondering is...

24:06.682 --> 24:08.502
if you're going to
kill Radio Saint Marie's

24:08.539 --> 24:10.697
long-serving DJ Dezzie Dixon,

24:10.885 --> 24:14.432
why would you do it in the middle
of a broadcast, live on air?

24:16.002 --> 24:17.541
No, it's fine.

24:17.601 --> 24:19.934
Everybody's trying too
hard, like they always do,

24:19.971 --> 24:22.337
and it's hotter than the sun,

24:22.717 --> 24:25.502
but I should be done in a day or two.

24:26.431 --> 24:29.111
I wouldn't know. I blocked his number.

24:29.466 --> 24:31.393
Well, that way, I don't have to wonder

24:31.430 --> 24:33.401
if he's going to call or not.

24:33.514 --> 24:36.401
- Night, Madeleine.
- Night, Inspector.

24:38.161 --> 24:40.160
What was that?

24:40.197 --> 24:42.580
Oh, no. An officer on
Saint Marie was shot.

24:42.617 --> 24:46.018
I need to assess whether
her superior was negligent.

24:48.784 --> 24:52.361
He's Scottish, I think.
Got a weird accent.

24:53.901 --> 24:56.268
Yeah, even if he's partly responsible,

24:56.305 --> 24:58.288
we'll have to suspend him.

24:58.396 --> 25:01.419
Probably send him back to the UK.

25:11.487 --> 25:13.519
- Sir?
- In here, JP.

25:15.760 --> 25:17.775
- Hey.
- Morning to the both of you.

25:17.812 --> 25:19.836
Perfect timing. Think I might
have something of interest.

25:19.860 --> 25:21.140
- And so do we, sir.
- Great!

25:21.177 --> 25:23.386
So, I was playing some of
these albums that I borrowed.

25:23.423 --> 25:25.504
I was reading the liner
notes, as you do,

25:25.618 --> 25:27.868
when I noticed Bunny Hicks'
name on one of them...

25:27.905 --> 25:29.351
he was the producer.

25:29.596 --> 25:33.026
These two, as well.
Pretty good they are, too.

25:33.354 --> 25:35.042
So, I checked out the history

25:35.079 --> 25:36.972
of the record label that
released these albums.

25:37.009 --> 25:39.156
Island Bay Records, they're called.

25:39.523 --> 25:42.103
Turns out Bunny Hicks was
a pretty important figure

25:42.140 --> 25:43.715
in the reggae scene back in the day,

25:43.898 --> 25:46.852
which begs the question,
"What went wrong?"

25:46.962 --> 25:50.454
To go from being the golden boy in a
successful music production company

25:50.491 --> 25:52.506
to helping out at a
local radio station...

25:52.543 --> 25:53.907
quite a fall from grace, no?

25:53.946 --> 25:56.542
Ruby, perhaps you could
do some Bunny digging.

25:56.594 --> 25:58.594
And what about you two?
You said you had something.

25:58.704 --> 26:01.149
The unidentified fingerprints
on the tape player...

26:01.186 --> 26:03.383
a match came through and it
belongs to someone called

26:03.420 --> 26:04.798
Stephane Leblanc.

26:04.835 --> 26:06.110
Also known as Junior.

26:06.147 --> 26:07.576
I'm sure you've seen him around, sir.

26:07.600 --> 26:10.599
- Previous for theft.
- Ah, yes. I think I know the fella.

26:10.796 --> 26:14.243
OK, JP, you and me,
let's go and talk to Junior.

26:14.317 --> 26:16.594
And, Ruby, could you head
to the police station?

26:16.680 --> 26:19.942
We mustn't forget about our
friend in Internal Affairs.

26:25.677 --> 26:27.712
You're going
to enjoy this next track.

26:27.776 --> 26:30.829
Well, Junior, listening to Dezzie there?

26:31.094 --> 26:32.868
They're playing all his old shows.

26:32.937 --> 26:34.641
Would you mind turning
it off for a moment?

26:34.696 --> 26:36.986
We just need to have a little chat.

26:43.914 --> 26:45.508
Good man.

26:45.545 --> 26:48.465
Now, do you know why we're here, Junior?

26:48.847 --> 26:51.329
Well, the thing is we
found your fingerprints

26:51.366 --> 26:54.227
on an old tape player that was
taken from the radio station

26:54.403 --> 26:56.298
the night poor Dezzie
Dixon was murdered.

26:56.335 --> 26:58.930
It was dumped in a bin
near the murder scene.

26:59.839 --> 27:03.485
Now, we couldn't help wondering
how your fingerprints got on it.

27:04.176 --> 27:07.087
- I have no idea.
- OK, JP, cuff him.

27:07.124 --> 27:09.382
Whoa! Whoa! Wait! Wait!
You're not locking me up.

27:09.419 --> 27:12.305
I ain't going back in
that cell of yours again.

27:12.429 --> 27:14.367
Smells funny.

27:14.949 --> 27:16.908
In your own time, Junior.

27:17.346 --> 27:19.425
I'd been hanging around
the food van that night...

27:20.321 --> 27:22.104
the one across from the station.

27:22.946 --> 27:24.235
And...?

27:24.272 --> 27:26.954
And I saw the old guy and the
young pretty thing who work there

27:26.991 --> 27:29.266
was leaving to get some food.

27:31.398 --> 27:34.401
So, I thought I'd go in and
have a little look around.

27:35.129 --> 27:38.152
Got to take your opportunities
when you can, living like this.

27:38.692 --> 27:40.563
And what happened when
you went in there?

27:40.906 --> 27:43.610
Place was empty.
I saw all this stuff on a table.

27:43.647 --> 27:46.219
Looked like it was ready
to chuck in the bin.

27:47.863 --> 27:50.579
So I grabbed the tape player and left.

27:50.720 --> 27:52.759
I thought I could do it up and sell it.

27:53.894 --> 27:56.321
I was on my way back here
when I heard what happened,

27:56.358 --> 27:59.555
so I dumped the tape player, and fast.

28:00.854 --> 28:02.837
That's all I know.

28:03.151 --> 28:05.186
And in the time you were
in the radio station,

28:05.304 --> 28:07.339
you're positive you didn't
see anyone else there?

28:07.376 --> 28:11.071
No, man.
Like I said, the place was empty.

28:12.667 --> 28:14.368
I swear I ain't lying to you.

28:14.405 --> 28:16.415
All I did was take that tape machine

28:16.526 --> 28:18.727
and go right back out that fire door.

28:19.149 --> 28:21.454
Sorry, back out the fire door?

28:21.674 --> 28:23.545
But didn't you come in
through the front entrance?

28:23.569 --> 28:24.813
No, man.

28:24.850 --> 28:27.243
Somebody left the fire
door open round the side.

28:27.351 --> 28:29.243
That's why I went in.

28:29.603 --> 28:31.225
The fire door was already open?

28:31.262 --> 28:33.194
That's what I said, isn't it?

28:40.070 --> 28:42.061
If Junior is telling the truth

28:42.098 --> 28:45.081
and that fire door was already
opened before Dezzie was shot,

28:45.390 --> 28:48.805
well, then that means someone working in
the radio station must have opened it.

28:48.842 --> 28:49.874
Why?

28:49.911 --> 28:52.555
To make it look like the killer
made their escape that way.

28:52.698 --> 28:54.661
Yeah, which means you were right, sir,

28:54.698 --> 28:57.697
about our killer being someone
from within the radio station.

28:57.734 --> 29:00.042
Can you play that recording again?

29:00.815 --> 29:03.485
Just before the gun is fired.

29:08.461 --> 29:10.341
Excuse me.
What are you doing here?

29:10.377 --> 29:12.641
There. He said,
"What are you doing here?"

29:12.678 --> 29:14.689
He wouldn't say that
to someone he knows,

29:14.726 --> 29:17.462
someone that worked with
him at the radio station.

29:17.571 --> 29:21.829
It sounds more like he's talking
to a stranger, an intruder, no?

29:21.926 --> 29:23.905
Well, yes, I mean...

29:23.942 --> 29:26.821
Which would once again make it unlikely

29:26.858 --> 29:30.485
that it's one of those three
people that all have alibis.

29:30.522 --> 29:32.345
Again, a very valid point, Madeleine,

29:32.382 --> 29:34.282
but I still believe we're right

29:34.319 --> 29:36.516
to focus on the people
closest to Dezzie.

29:36.553 --> 29:39.032
Well, if that's what you think.

29:43.554 --> 29:47.537
So... what else have we got?

29:47.890 --> 29:49.421
Erm, yes.

29:49.554 --> 29:53.171
So, sir, the financial checks are back,

29:53.273 --> 29:54.554
and it seems Carlton Brown

29:54.591 --> 29:56.320
is the only one with a
healthy bank account.

29:56.357 --> 29:58.751
- Oh?
- Yeah, he earns a six-figure salary,

29:58.788 --> 30:00.249
whereas Faith Butler

30:00.286 --> 30:02.515
is servicing some serious
debts her mother left her.

30:02.552 --> 30:06.702
So, maybe Faith killed
Dezzie for the money.

30:06.834 --> 30:08.587
I doubt it.

30:08.624 --> 30:11.054
I mean, he only had a couple
of thousand in his savings.

30:11.091 --> 30:13.498
Ruby, did you manage to dig
up anything on Bunny Hicks?

30:13.535 --> 30:16.413
Actually, the sarge and I did
some digging together, didn't we?

30:16.450 --> 30:19.592
We talked to one of the
directors at Island Bay Records.

30:19.629 --> 30:21.460
Where Bunny worked as a music producer.

30:21.497 --> 30:24.460
And it turns out Dezzie also
worked there many years ago

30:24.497 --> 30:26.663
and something went down
between the both of them...

30:26.700 --> 30:30.359
something bad... but the guy
we spoke to wouldn't say what.

30:30.429 --> 30:33.448
All that we could get is that
Bunny never recovered from it.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.131
It's market day!

30:43.168 --> 30:45.968
Sorry, but what does the
market have to do with this?

30:46.913 --> 30:50.702
Oh, Chiggy who runs the record stall,
he's an encyclopaedia of reggae history.

30:52.220 --> 30:55.515
However, his tongue might need
a bit of loosening up first.

30:57.826 --> 30:59.862
Won't be a tick.

31:06.812 --> 31:09.839
Does he often drink alcohol
with potential witnesses?

31:10.082 --> 31:13.734
No. Well, not often.

31:14.111 --> 31:19.710
OK, Sarge, sometimes, things just
work like that on the island.

31:19.813 --> 31:22.817
Even so,
it's half past ten in the morning.

31:24.612 --> 31:25.882
How did you get on, sir?

31:25.919 --> 31:28.946
You were right... according to
Chiggy, it's thanks to Dezzie

31:28.983 --> 31:31.954
that Bunny never worked
as a music producer again.

31:32.131 --> 31:34.991
- I'm going to go and speak to him.
- Can I come with you, Inspector?

31:35.163 --> 31:36.874
Of course.

31:37.023 --> 31:39.327
You're keen to observe my
interview technique, I imagine.

31:39.403 --> 31:41.226
Oh, no, it's more that I don't think

31:41.263 --> 31:43.120
that you should be
driving a police vehicle

31:43.157 --> 31:46.105
on public roads after consuming alcohol.

31:48.377 --> 31:50.885
Let me just
turn this down a little bit.

31:50.985 --> 31:53.440
Actually, leave it for a moment.

31:54.087 --> 31:56.322
Lee "Scratch" Perry. Am I right?

31:56.359 --> 31:58.386
The man is good.

32:01.460 --> 32:05.523
This is a limited edition
original pressing.

32:05.946 --> 32:08.369
It's worth a pretty penny, you know.

32:08.406 --> 32:11.429
Plenty times I think, when I am broke,

32:11.812 --> 32:16.580
when I am low on cash,
I always have this to sell.

32:18.866 --> 32:20.471
But something tells me, Inspector,

32:20.508 --> 32:22.979
that you're not just
here to chat about music.

32:23.160 --> 32:28.455
Well, we heard that you and
Dezzie weren't the great friends

32:28.555 --> 32:30.530
that a lot of people thought you were.

32:30.819 --> 32:33.863
Since what happened
at Island Bay Records.

32:34.377 --> 32:36.181
Now, correct me if I'm wrong.

32:36.218 --> 32:38.424
When Dezzie was still
making a name for himself,

32:38.651 --> 32:41.268
he got his hands on an
album that you'd produced,

32:41.478 --> 32:45.260
and he thought he could do
better, so he remixed it,

32:45.559 --> 32:47.080
but he made it worse.

32:48.375 --> 32:52.721
Look, we had to delay the album launch.

32:53.190 --> 32:54.791
Cost the company a fortune.

32:54.828 --> 32:56.880
And they held you responsible.

32:59.490 --> 33:01.780
It's still in there, isn't it, Bunny?

33:02.219 --> 33:06.592
It's still inside you...
the anger at what Dezzie did.

33:07.007 --> 33:11.225
Look... he apologised 100 times over.

33:12.139 --> 33:14.772
Got me a job at the
station to make up for it.

33:15.054 --> 33:18.288
And I played along,
like I put it behind me.

33:19.100 --> 33:21.733
But there are some things
that happen to you in life

33:21.874 --> 33:23.952
that you never come back from.

33:25.996 --> 33:30.506
And was it you who shot him two
nights ago at that radio station?

33:31.570 --> 33:36.741
Inspector, I dreamed of
doing it plenty of times,

33:37.128 --> 33:39.428
but it wasn't me who pulled the trigger.

33:40.105 --> 33:43.108
And as I told you already,
there's a handful of people

33:43.211 --> 33:47.561
who can testify that I was across
the street getting my dinner

33:47.598 --> 33:49.217
when Dezzie got shot.

33:49.499 --> 33:51.084
All right?

33:54.585 --> 33:57.296
12 minutes past nine, two nights ago,

33:57.551 --> 33:59.460
the residents of this fair isle

33:59.497 --> 34:02.272
played witness to the
murder of Dezzie Dixon

34:02.382 --> 34:05.647
as it was transmitted
live on Radio Saint Marie.

34:06.121 --> 34:08.096
Our suspects number three.

34:08.472 --> 34:10.444
So far, we've found
motives for two of them.

34:10.481 --> 34:12.085
- Faith Butler.
- And Bunny Hicks.

34:12.121 --> 34:14.741
But both of them have
irrefutable alibis.

34:15.132 --> 34:17.498
Our third suspect is that man there.

34:17.597 --> 34:19.936
Currently, he has no
motive that we're aware of,

34:19.976 --> 34:23.420
but, of course, he, too,
has a watertight alibi.

34:23.694 --> 34:26.389
He was seen across town
at the time of the murder

34:26.426 --> 34:27.678
at the Palm Tree Club.

34:27.715 --> 34:29.956
But if it is one of them...

34:31.574 --> 34:33.960
which one is it and why did they feel

34:33.996 --> 34:35.059
that murdering Dezzie Dixon

34:35.083 --> 34:36.882
in the middle of a
Sunday-night broadcast

34:36.918 --> 34:38.702
was the best way to go about it?

34:41.030 --> 34:43.210
Maybe we should call it a day, just...

34:43.262 --> 34:45.119
approach it afresh in the morning.

34:45.824 --> 34:47.783
Well, goodnight.

34:47.916 --> 34:49.088
Goodnight, Sarge.

34:49.125 --> 34:51.097
- Night.
- Goodnight, guys.

34:59.898 --> 35:05.163
Sorry, Madeleine, before you go,
do you have any plans for this evening?

35:05.218 --> 35:07.173
Oh, I'm just going back to my hotel.

35:07.369 --> 35:09.968
I was just wondering if you
fancied dinner chez Mooney.

35:10.159 --> 35:12.773
If nothing else,
the view from my place is to die for.

35:13.288 --> 35:15.757
Well, why not? I'll go take a shower

35:15.794 --> 35:16.957
and meet you there in an hour.

35:16.981 --> 35:18.491
Perfect.

35:22.371 --> 35:25.494
- Is everything OK, sir?
- Yeah. No. Just couldn't help feeling

35:25.531 --> 35:27.507
that things aren't
going spectacularly well

35:27.544 --> 35:30.546
with DS Dumas,
so I've invited her for dinner.

35:41.477 --> 35:44.084
Oh, thanks.

35:46.234 --> 35:48.773
Saint Marie is very beautiful.

35:49.350 --> 35:51.952
And this place...

35:52.435 --> 35:54.108
you're lucky.

35:54.207 --> 35:55.841
Not a bad life, I suppose.

35:55.901 --> 35:57.890
Wake up to the sound of the waves.

35:57.972 --> 35:59.963
- Swim before breakfast.
- Mm.

36:00.066 --> 36:01.851
And fresh coconut on tap.

36:01.951 --> 36:04.273
Oh, you know, I never had a
fresh coconut from a tree.

36:04.310 --> 36:06.921
Really? Well,
we'll have to do something about that.

36:06.958 --> 36:08.101
Well...

36:08.168 --> 36:09.640
And what about you?

36:09.787 --> 36:11.769
All I know is you've given up smoking.

36:12.430 --> 36:16.905
Well, I live in Paris.
I have a cat called Maurice.

36:17.026 --> 36:18.960
I love to cook and paint

36:18.997 --> 36:21.671
and watch movies with
a glass of red wine

36:21.708 --> 36:24.288
and the darkest
chocolate bar I can find.

36:25.028 --> 36:27.366
- Not married, no?
- No.

36:27.522 --> 36:29.561
I was in a relationship
for eight months,

36:29.598 --> 36:32.741
but the boyfriend broke
up with me two weeks ago.

36:33.653 --> 36:34.952
Sorry to hear that.

36:34.989 --> 36:36.296
It's OK. Don't be.

36:36.380 --> 36:40.280
He was a peacock with the
brain of a cheese sandwich.

36:40.502 --> 36:41.983
- Not a great combination.
- No.

36:42.020 --> 36:44.954
- Bonsoir, Jack.
- Ah, Catherine. Good evening.

36:45.108 --> 36:48.819
This is Detective Sergeant Madeleine
Dumas from the Paris police.

36:48.856 --> 36:50.875
It's lovely to meet you, Madeleine.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.882
I would shake your hand, but...

36:52.919 --> 36:55.046
Let me. You probably guessed...

36:55.148 --> 36:56.368
I'm not doing the cooking.

36:56.405 --> 36:57.468
- Oh.
- Catherine...

36:57.505 --> 36:59.366
she owns a lovely
little bar around here.

36:59.403 --> 37:02.218
And don't worry,
it's all authentic Caribbean nosh.

37:02.488 --> 37:03.608
Parfait.

37:03.684 --> 37:05.937
Thanks, Catherine. You're a star.

37:06.037 --> 37:08.331
Just go and get this warmed up.

37:11.078 --> 37:14.748
So... you're working with Jack.

37:15.229 --> 37:17.244
- Only for a few days.
- Oh.

37:17.432 --> 37:19.905
It's a shame you won't have
longer to get to know him.

37:20.004 --> 37:24.030
Oh... I think I've got to
know him enough already.

37:24.317 --> 37:26.812
You know him well?

37:26.849 --> 37:30.507
- Oh, very well. He's always at my bar.
- Is that so?

37:30.544 --> 37:32.858
For Jack, work never finishes.

37:33.029 --> 37:37.343
He and JP and Ruby use my
place as a second office.

37:37.475 --> 37:41.463
You mean he discusses his
cases in a public bar?

37:42.102 --> 37:44.390
I've even helped him solve some of them.

37:44.457 --> 37:46.436
You should put that in your report.

37:46.820 --> 37:48.804
Oh, I will.

37:50.557 --> 37:53.553
Now, excuse me.
I must get back to the bar.

37:54.472 --> 37:57.249
- Bon appetit, Jack!
- Thanks, Catherine!

37:57.317 --> 37:58.562
Bye.

38:00.285 --> 38:02.671
Now, Madeleine...

38:02.901 --> 38:04.991
how about we go and
get you that coconut?

38:05.381 --> 38:07.384
OK, that's the first one.

38:07.460 --> 38:09.166
Are you positive this is safe?

38:09.203 --> 38:12.749
Oh, absolutely. I've done
this 100 times. Probably more.

38:14.138 --> 38:16.156
Just... usually in the morning I do it,

38:16.193 --> 38:18.437
when there's less mosquitos around.

38:18.474 --> 38:20.226
Blasted things. Get away!

38:20.292 --> 38:23.702
- Please be careful up there!
- Don't worry about me. I'll be fine.

38:29.116 --> 38:30.483
Oh!

38:37.458 --> 38:40.482
- Night, fellas. Thanks for the help.
- Any time, Jack.

38:48.672 --> 38:51.071
I really can't apologise
enough, Madeleine.

38:51.133 --> 38:54.680
It's fine. Nothing is broken.

38:56.187 --> 38:58.821
And there was me thinking I'd go
up in your estimation tonight.

38:58.867 --> 38:59.986
I'm sorry?

39:00.023 --> 39:01.679
Well, no, I just...

39:02.176 --> 39:05.807
I'm aware that maybe I haven't made
the greatest of impressions on you

39:05.844 --> 39:07.563
over the last couple of days.

39:07.634 --> 39:10.164
Dropping a coconut on you...
that's not going to help, is it?

39:10.226 --> 39:12.531
Are you worried about my report?

39:15.522 --> 39:18.008
Why don't I tell you
what I'm going to write?

39:18.104 --> 39:20.336
Then you won't have to wonder any more.

39:22.906 --> 39:27.873
Well... from the case notes...
even the ones covered in jam...

39:27.972 --> 39:33.117
it is very clear that DS Cassell
acted completely on her own behalf

39:33.502 --> 39:36.577
and it was those actions
that led to her injury.

39:37.008 --> 39:42.672
I doubt any... blame could be
attributed to you... directly.

39:44.546 --> 39:46.285
"Directly"?

39:46.354 --> 39:48.266
If you ran a tighter ship,

39:48.426 --> 39:53.414
DS Cassell may have not felt
able to go off on her own.

39:54.648 --> 39:56.922
And that's what you'll be
writing in your report?

39:57.508 --> 39:59.432
Yes, it is.

40:07.269 --> 40:08.976
I understand.

40:11.577 --> 40:13.576
You have to write what you think.

40:17.348 --> 40:19.074
It's your taxi.

40:23.156 --> 40:24.653
Thank you.

40:27.098 --> 40:29.050
Goodnight, Inspector.

40:34.924 --> 40:36.463
I'm sorry.

40:47.878 --> 40:50.948
You're
listening to Radio Saint Marie.

40:50.985 --> 40:54.487
It's just gone nine o'clock
and the weather outside is hot.

40:54.596 --> 40:56.003
Damned hot!

40:56.067 --> 41:00.605
So, kick off your shoes,
sit back and join me, Dezzie Dixon,

41:00.642 --> 41:03.693
for the next two hours while I
play the very best in reggae music.

41:04.258 --> 41:05.659
- You hungry?
- Mm.

41:05.698 --> 41:08.386
All right, everybody, Dezzie Dixon here.

41:09.539 --> 41:12.081
Well, I won't tell
management if you won't.

41:12.118 --> 41:14.129
Somebody left
the fire door open.

41:14.166 --> 41:16.206
I was on the other side of
the bay when it happened.

41:18.223 --> 41:20.159
Dad!

41:25.522 --> 41:27.019
Oh!

41:43.860 --> 41:44.940
Saint Marie Police.

41:44.977 --> 41:48.940
JP, Carlton Brown has an assigned
parking bay at the station.

41:48.977 --> 41:51.980
OK. And you're telling
me that because...?

41:52.017 --> 41:53.694
Well, how come he told
us he finds it easier

41:53.718 --> 41:55.181
to park his BMW a few streets away?

41:55.218 --> 41:57.751
He's got a reserved spot
right here in front of me.

41:57.916 --> 41:59.787
- Mm, that is odd, sir.
- What's the name of the witness

41:59.811 --> 42:01.255
who saw his car the night of the murder?

42:01.279 --> 42:02.654
Erm...

42:03.929 --> 42:06.916
Madame Touzard, 3 Rue du Castella.

42:07.074 --> 42:09.070
- Right, meet me there.
- Yes, sir.

42:10.954 --> 42:13.189
OK, Ruby, the inspector wants us

42:13.226 --> 42:15.188
over at your old headmistress's house.

42:15.225 --> 42:17.719
- Great!
- You coming, Sarge?

42:17.871 --> 42:19.887
Non, merci. I'm busy.

42:22.432 --> 42:23.846
OK.

42:30.986 --> 42:34.033
It's back... Carlton Brown's blue BMW.

42:34.129 --> 42:35.602
Carlton Brown with it.

42:35.674 --> 42:37.594
He let himself into that
house about an hour ago.

42:37.625 --> 42:39.531
It's not the first time Madame
Touzard has seen his car

42:39.555 --> 42:41.510
since the night of the murder.

42:41.611 --> 42:44.393
There's been three other occasions
he's parked up on this street.

42:44.643 --> 42:46.698
I wonder what he's up to, sir.

42:46.976 --> 42:50.135
So, is DS Dumas done
shadowing us now, sir?

42:50.678 --> 42:53.157
I... believe so, yes.

42:53.313 --> 42:57.244
Just got her report to write
up and then she's out of here.

42:57.679 --> 42:59.730
I thought it would take
her longer than that.

43:00.301 --> 43:03.275
Well... I think she's made her decision,

43:03.619 --> 43:06.197
so no need to hang about, I guess.

43:06.847 --> 43:09.119
Eyeballs on the suspect, sir.

43:12.721 --> 43:15.764
Well, I think we now all know
what's been going on in that house.

43:16.484 --> 43:18.266
Naughty boy.

43:19.863 --> 43:22.455
You have to promise you
will never, ever tell my wife.

43:22.588 --> 43:25.072
Well, it depends on how
cooperative you are.

43:25.518 --> 43:28.559
So, to start, why don't you tell
us about your real movements

43:28.596 --> 43:29.996
on the night of the murder?

43:30.078 --> 43:32.483
OK. So, I was at the
Palm Tree Club at six...

43:32.520 --> 43:34.231
I wasn't lying about that...

43:34.285 --> 43:36.848
and at 12 minutes past nine
when Dezzie was murdered.

43:37.003 --> 43:39.551
- And in between?
- I was with Jenna.

43:39.645 --> 43:42.129
- That's the woman we just saw you with?
- Mm.

43:42.355 --> 43:45.465
And what time were you there
on the night of the murder?

43:45.567 --> 43:49.082
From seven-ish till just before nine.
8:45, say.

43:49.119 --> 43:51.142
- And she can corroborate that?
- Yes.

43:51.473 --> 43:53.871
I had nothing to do with Dezzie's
death, I swear it.

43:53.950 --> 43:56.020
Did Dezzie know about
you and Miss Devaux?

43:56.057 --> 43:57.134
No.

43:57.222 --> 43:59.629
You know, that first night we met,

43:59.793 --> 44:02.403
when you gave me your alibi even
though I didn't ask you for one,

44:02.440 --> 44:03.926
you acted shifty.

44:04.155 --> 44:08.155
And you just did it there again,
which makes me think you're lying.

44:08.960 --> 44:10.939
He caught me with Jenna
a couple of times.

44:11.041 --> 44:13.176
So what? He was going to tell your wife?

44:14.350 --> 44:17.244
Why? I mean... Dezzie didn't strike me

44:17.281 --> 44:20.213
as the type of person to
take the moral high ground.

44:20.905 --> 44:22.488
I was trying to get rid of him.

44:22.814 --> 44:26.043
Was hired last year to take Radio
Saint Marie in a new direction

44:26.080 --> 44:28.115
and attract younger listeners.

44:28.335 --> 44:31.988
As part of your remit to attract
a younger audience to the station.

44:32.769 --> 44:35.838
But you couldn't get rid of Mr Dixon
because he knew about your affair.

44:35.875 --> 44:38.199
B-But it doesn't mean it
was me that killed him.

44:38.283 --> 44:40.310
I was back at the club
when Dezzie was shot.

44:40.491 --> 44:42.762
There were witnesses that
saw me take the call.

44:43.971 --> 44:46.637
Yet another suspect who has motive,

44:46.737 --> 44:50.160
but throws back in our face the
fact they have a rock-solid alibi.

44:50.316 --> 44:53.283
I am just as baffled and
bemused as I was at the start.

44:53.519 --> 44:55.770
That was the lab, sir,
and it's not good news.

44:55.811 --> 44:57.676
- Go on.
- So, they've done their best

44:57.713 --> 44:59.793
enhancing the recording
of Dezzie's shooting,

44:59.830 --> 45:01.865
but there's just nothing
they can get from it.

45:13.371 --> 45:17.035
That was a classic
from reggae great Jimmy Cliff.

45:17.072 --> 45:21.301
Now The Pioneers with
Long Shot Kick De Bucket.

45:23.549 --> 45:25.371
Listening to poor old Dezzie there.

45:25.621 --> 45:28.098
They're playing all his old shows.

45:28.613 --> 45:32.541
- Sir?
- That should be on, shouldn't it?

45:33.701 --> 45:35.520
Sorry, would you mind telling me

45:35.557 --> 45:38.340
why, when you're broadcasting
Dezzie's old shows right now,

45:38.377 --> 45:40.254
why is the "on air" light off?

45:40.291 --> 45:42.902
Because it's never on when
pre-recording's playing.

45:43.042 --> 45:46.535
It's only when the studio mic is
live that it comes on, you see.

45:58.355 --> 46:00.793
Dezzie just carried on regardless.

46:00.952 --> 46:02.959
- Bunny, you hungry?
- Mm.

46:02.996 --> 46:04.293
All right, everybody.

46:04.330 --> 46:05.504
What are you doing here?

46:07.749 --> 46:09.792
Somebody left the fire
door open round the side.

46:09.886 --> 46:11.886
I went to see if anyone
was out there, but...

46:14.492 --> 46:15.934
Window's locked from the inside.

46:15.971 --> 46:18.002
What's she saying, JP?

46:18.207 --> 46:20.856
I mean, he only had a couple
of thousand in his savings.

46:20.893 --> 46:23.932
When I'm low on cash,
I always have this to sell.

46:24.148 --> 46:25.871
- That's it.
- You've solved it, sir?

46:25.908 --> 46:28.332
Very nearly, Ruby. Very nearly indeed.

46:29.027 --> 46:32.553
I just... need to pay a visit
to our old friend Junior,

46:32.656 --> 46:33.879
ask him a quick question.

46:33.916 --> 46:36.363
JP, come with me.
I need you to get a search warrant.

46:36.515 --> 46:38.832
Ruby, I want you to
gather everyone together.

46:38.869 --> 46:40.106
Yes, sir.

46:40.210 --> 46:42.676
Ruby, I need you to get everyone

46:42.713 --> 46:44.113
to the police station, not here.

46:44.150 --> 46:45.246
Well why?

46:45.283 --> 46:47.285
Because I'm worried that
DS Dumas is going to make

46:47.322 --> 46:48.876
the wrong decision about the inspector,

46:48.900 --> 46:51.426
so we need to prove
to her how good he is,

46:51.463 --> 46:53.063
OK? All right.

46:55.648 --> 46:59.616
If all of you can just wait
here for a minute. Thank you.

47:03.748 --> 47:06.233
The inspector's solved the case

47:06.285 --> 47:08.823
and he's coming here
to reveal who did it.

47:08.898 --> 47:10.123
Great.

47:10.160 --> 47:11.905
Erm, maybe you could stay

47:11.942 --> 47:13.756
and watch him explain, Sarge.

47:13.793 --> 47:17.193
- Trust me, it's always the best bit.
- I need to finish this.

47:17.281 --> 47:21.889
Erm, maybe... before you
finish the report, you could...

47:21.926 --> 47:23.874
Sorry, this won't help.

47:32.946 --> 47:34.930
Well, come on!

47:41.864 --> 47:43.868
Right.

47:47.194 --> 47:52.077
The question at the heart of this
investigation was a real puzzler.

47:52.717 --> 47:56.546
Why would someone choose to commit
murder live on national radio...

47:57.647 --> 48:01.398
murdering a man when half
the island's listening in?

48:02.843 --> 48:05.210
Well, that appears to be what
happened three nights ago.

48:05.385 --> 48:09.132
An intruder walked in to
the radio station unnoticed,

48:09.405 --> 48:13.281
pulled out a gun and shot
poor Dezzie Dixon live on air

48:13.363 --> 48:16.202
and then left again,
exiting through the fire door.

48:17.014 --> 48:19.082
But that isn't actually what happened.

48:21.207 --> 48:23.374
It was just staged to look like that.

48:24.745 --> 48:28.126
Now, my instincts told
me that our killer

48:28.163 --> 48:29.866
wasn't someone from outside the station,

48:29.903 --> 48:34.702
but from within, and I was right...
it was one of you three.

48:38.394 --> 48:41.281
Carlton, you were at the Palm Tree
Club at the time of the shooting.

48:41.351 --> 48:44.949
Bunny and Faith, you had gone to
the food truck outside the station

48:45.007 --> 48:46.343
to get your dinner.

48:46.410 --> 48:48.734
You even heard the murder
happening on the radio.

48:49.510 --> 48:53.343
And therein lies the
answer to our puzzle.

48:54.804 --> 48:56.736
You see...

48:59.870 --> 49:05.823
what I finally realised is
that one of you, the killer...

49:06.534 --> 49:10.018
wanted to make it look like
someone was shot live on air,

49:10.342 --> 49:13.377
if, in doing so,
it gave you a rock-solid alibi.

49:14.237 --> 49:15.777
Isn't that right?

49:15.943 --> 49:17.143
Faith?

49:17.299 --> 49:18.627
What?

49:19.564 --> 49:20.707
I loved Dad.

49:20.744 --> 49:22.463
Oh, come on, now. Let's not play games.

49:22.500 --> 49:24.096
I know it was you, Faith.

49:24.234 --> 49:26.682
That gunshot was heard
at 12 minutes past nine,

49:26.764 --> 49:28.526
but that isn't when Dezzie was shot.

49:28.563 --> 49:29.987
No, it just sounded like that.

49:30.071 --> 49:32.893
What myself and the people
of Saint Marie actually heard

49:32.930 --> 49:35.541
was a recording being
played, and the reality is,

49:35.578 --> 49:37.370
Dezzie was killed a few minutes later.

49:37.526 --> 49:40.079
Let me explain exactly what happened.

49:40.328 --> 49:42.831
When I spoke to Junior
here two days ago,

49:43.097 --> 49:45.963
he was listening to re-runs
of Dezzie's old shows

49:46.000 --> 49:49.019
on Radio Saint Marie.
Listening to poor old Dezzie there.

49:49.056 --> 49:50.932
They're playing all his old shows.

49:51.029 --> 49:53.432
And it got me thinking...
there must be hundreds of hours

49:53.469 --> 49:55.698
of Dezzie's old shows in
the station's archives.

49:55.788 --> 49:57.215
Am I right, Mr Brown?

49:57.643 --> 50:00.151
And Faith having passed her
media and communications

50:00.188 --> 50:01.657
course with distinction...

50:01.694 --> 50:04.393
I did media and communications
studies at college.

50:04.691 --> 50:07.503
And with her excellent
audio editing skills,

50:07.635 --> 50:08.900
she would have no trouble

50:08.937 --> 50:11.753
splicing together bits of
footage of Dezzie speaking

50:11.824 --> 50:13.783
taken from his old shows,

50:13.846 --> 50:16.846
so it would appear that Dezzie
was broadcasting as normal.

50:17.991 --> 50:20.799
And in this way,
she cleverly put together

50:20.836 --> 50:24.010
some of Dezzie's words to
form those two sentences,

50:24.109 --> 50:26.132
which we're now all so familiar with.

50:26.211 --> 50:28.182
Excuse me.

50:28.246 --> 50:30.417
What are you doing here?

50:30.894 --> 50:33.865
And then you added the
sound effect of a gunshot

50:33.990 --> 50:35.401
and you were away in a hack.

50:37.066 --> 50:40.101
A recording lasting only a few minutes

50:40.195 --> 50:44.628
that creates the perfect illusion of
Dezzie being murdered live on air.

50:46.042 --> 50:48.049
And then, just before
you went for your dinner,

50:48.086 --> 50:49.323
you cued up the record...

50:49.360 --> 50:51.344
I'm going over to Raymond's. You hungry?

50:53.320 --> 50:55.604
Having already secretly
opened the fire door,

50:55.641 --> 50:58.253
so it would look like that's
how the killer made their exit.

50:58.651 --> 51:00.634
Yourself and Bunny went
out to the food truck

51:01.010 --> 51:03.610
and when you heard that gunshot
coming out of that little radio...

51:05.210 --> 51:07.487
you both hurried back
inside to see what happened.

51:07.578 --> 51:10.198
And you made sure you got
to the studio door first.

51:10.378 --> 51:12.862
You peered in and you claimed
that Dezzie wasn't there...

51:12.899 --> 51:14.284
He's not there.

51:14.321 --> 51:15.698
But that was a lie.

51:15.735 --> 51:18.940
He was there, and still very
much alive at this stage,

51:19.367 --> 51:21.815
blissfully unaware that
anything was amiss.

51:21.852 --> 51:24.534
He carried on broadcasting,
and you could see him.

51:24.819 --> 51:26.894
When you asked Bunny to
go and phone the police...

51:26.931 --> 51:28.047
- Call the police.
- You...

51:28.071 --> 51:31.184
pretended to head towards the
fire door to look for your father.

51:31.367 --> 51:34.042
But as soon as Bunny was out of
sight, you doubled back

51:34.105 --> 51:38.096
and you went into the studio,
where you retrieved the gun...

51:38.350 --> 51:40.753
- Faith, no, no, no.
- Shut up!

51:43.067 --> 51:44.753
And you shot him.

51:47.561 --> 51:50.202
Even though Bunny was just next
door, he never heard the gunshot

51:50.264 --> 51:52.757
because, of course,
the studio was sound-proofed.

51:54.605 --> 51:56.702
And then you opened the
window, climbed out,

51:56.739 --> 51:58.593
making sure it was closed behind you,

51:59.442 --> 52:01.632
and then you hid the gun somewhere

52:01.669 --> 52:03.952
on your way around to the fire door.

52:05.050 --> 52:07.679
So, by the time Bunny came
off the phone to the police,

52:08.465 --> 52:09.960
you were already outside.

52:09.997 --> 52:11.382
Dad!

52:14.315 --> 52:17.374
And so the illusion was sold...

52:18.382 --> 52:20.233
you were never in the studio.

52:20.445 --> 52:23.616
Once the body was discovered,
well, it would only take a moment

52:23.653 --> 52:25.655
for you to close the
catch on the window.

52:28.611 --> 52:31.622
What Faith didn't know,
and certainly didn't expect,

52:31.936 --> 52:34.956
was that Junior here,
he noticed the fire door was open.

52:36.196 --> 52:39.191
And in his way, he decided to have
a little shufty inside that night

52:39.582 --> 52:41.866
just moments before the
real murder took place,

52:41.941 --> 52:44.288
and he confirmed what I suspected...

52:44.435 --> 52:47.507
the "on air" light was off
when Dezzie was killed.

52:48.023 --> 52:51.561
It would only be on if Dezzie's
mic was live in the studio.

52:52.175 --> 52:54.179
It wasn't on when I was there.

52:54.738 --> 52:57.749
You can't prove this. Any of it.

52:57.786 --> 53:00.444
No? Well,
let's go back to the gun you hid.

53:02.694 --> 53:06.413
As soon as we left for the night,
you snuck back to the radio station

53:06.450 --> 53:09.983
to recover the gun from its hiding
place, and you took it home,

53:10.635 --> 53:12.662
assuming that we would
never search your place.

53:12.999 --> 53:15.436
Why would we? You had an alibi.

53:17.729 --> 53:20.538
One court warrant to enter
your property, Miss Butler.

53:20.575 --> 53:22.890
Ooh, and one handgun.

53:23.647 --> 53:26.874
Same calibre as the bullet
used to kill Dezzie.

53:29.760 --> 53:32.791
But why? Why would she do this?

53:33.433 --> 53:37.405
Well, in the end,
I don't think this was about revenge.

53:38.566 --> 53:41.140
I think Faith reunited with her father

53:41.177 --> 53:44.702
because there was something
else she was after... money.

53:44.800 --> 53:46.237
Whereas Faith Butler

53:46.274 --> 53:48.659
is servicing some serious
debts her mother left her.

53:48.755 --> 53:50.051
And as a one-time shoplifter,

53:50.088 --> 53:52.390
this was a woman who always
wanted more than she had.

53:52.427 --> 53:53.835
Multiple cautions for shoplifting

53:53.888 --> 53:55.509
on Barbados when she was younger.

53:56.085 --> 53:58.208
And as it turns out,
quite a lot of money

53:58.245 --> 54:00.127
in old reggae albums,
isn't there, Bunny?

54:00.442 --> 54:02.705
It's worth a pretty penny, you know.

54:03.213 --> 54:04.518
And Dezzie had hundreds of them.

54:04.555 --> 54:06.602
That is a damn fine
collection of records.

54:06.855 --> 54:09.104
And all original vinyl recordings.

54:09.195 --> 54:13.154
I imagine his estate is worth
tens of thousands of dollars...

54:13.585 --> 54:16.119
an amount very much worth killing over.

54:18.218 --> 54:21.143
JP, Ruby, take her to the cells.

54:25.804 --> 54:28.237
The rest of you, free to go.

54:37.008 --> 54:39.944
Hello?

54:40.710 --> 54:45.461
Yes, I am finishing it off now.

54:50.309 --> 54:51.891
Commissioner.

54:56.639 --> 54:59.038
Word has reached me
you've solved the case.

54:59.152 --> 55:01.093
I did, you'll be pleased to know.

55:01.208 --> 55:03.683
Then well done, Inspector.

55:04.389 --> 55:06.647
And what about that other business?

55:09.155 --> 55:12.159
I think you're going to have to
start looking for a replacement.

55:14.250 --> 55:17.158
Is this true, Sergeant Dumas?

55:17.733 --> 55:20.874
Your report will be advising
the chief commissioner in Paris

55:20.911 --> 55:23.772
that DI Mooney should be replaced?

55:23.857 --> 55:25.852
It is what I have written, yes.

55:26.398 --> 55:28.530
The only conclusion I can draw

55:28.567 --> 55:31.264
observing DI Mooney the last few days

55:31.301 --> 55:34.147
is that he is disorganised,

55:34.520 --> 55:38.519
often chaotic, incoherent, rambling...

55:38.556 --> 55:40.543
Don't dress it up, Madeleine.

55:40.938 --> 55:42.902
However...

55:43.406 --> 55:47.139
what I just saw,
what you just did up there...

55:47.358 --> 55:48.581
you're good.

55:48.618 --> 55:50.421
- Really good.
- You're just being kind.

55:50.458 --> 55:54.210
No, no, I have no idea
how you did it, but...

55:54.573 --> 55:58.889
but you made sense of something
that made literally no sense.

55:59.100 --> 56:02.124
Honestly, you took my breath away.

56:03.922 --> 56:05.507
Well...?

56:05.608 --> 56:10.409
Well... if you and the inspector
can agree to keep working

56:10.446 --> 56:13.397
on the many, many flaws he has,

56:13.898 --> 56:15.897
then I can agree to highlight the value

56:15.934 --> 56:19.155
he brings to this island as
a detective in my report.

56:19.234 --> 56:21.960
Consider it done, Sergeant Dumas.

56:22.223 --> 56:25.046
Then I shall go and
amend it immediately.

56:34.432 --> 56:38.143
- Keep it up, Inspector.
- Will do, Commissioner. Will do.
