12:07.561 --> 12:10.394
- Dr. Saroyan.
- Dr. Tanaka.

12:10.480 --> 12:12.892
With your permission,
I would like to free
the head oftissue.

12:12.983 --> 12:15.895
I have a test to perform first.

12:15.986 --> 12:17.977
You’re welcome to observe.

12:19.990 --> 12:23.448
- This is ferrocene?
- Yes. I’m testing for gunshot residue.

12:26.663 --> 12:29.279
- No reaction.
- Any shot fired within five feet...

12:29.374 --> 12:31.660
would have left residue.

12:31.752 --> 12:33.663
The angle of entry
was steep,

12:33.754 --> 12:37.167
- exiting at the top ofthe cranium.
- Sachi was only five feet tall.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.634
Even ifthe killer was lying on
the ground, there’d be residue.

12:39.718 --> 12:41.629
Perhaps she was
coming do wnstairs.

12:41.720 --> 12:44.336
Or maybe standing
on the balcony of her apartment.

12:44.431 --> 12:46.843
Grab some goggles
and a mask.

13:03.033 --> 13:05.274
Did you know the victim,
Dr. Tanaka?

13:05.369 --> 13:08.657
I met Sachi three times.
She and her brother
were very close.

13:08.747 --> 13:12.535
That’s a very big favor
to do Detective Nakamura,
coming all the way from Japan.

13:12.626 --> 13:14.867
Iwould do anything
for him.

13:49.579 --> 13:51.661

the wound track,

13:51.748 --> 13:53.739

exit trauma.

13:53.834 --> 13:55.745
Thank you.

[Brennan]
Since Booth took you
out of the field

13:58.004 --> 13:59.960
I thought perhaps
you’d like to consolidate...

14:00.048 --> 14:03.040
the results ofour analysis
to convey to Booth.

14:03.135 --> 14:05.217
You are trying
to make me feel useful.

14:06.263 --> 14:08.754
No, I— I don’t really
do things like that.

14:08.890 --> 14:12.053
I owe you for talking Booth
out of sending me home.
Wasn’tme.

14:12.144 --> 14:14.385
Booth is a very empathetic man.

14:14.479 --> 14:17.016
Yes. Are you aware
how we met?

14:17.107 --> 14:20.474
Um, some kind
of exchange program?

14:20.569 --> 14:24.187
Ha/Z Most of
the FBI. agents showed up...

14:24.281 --> 14:27.148
and started telling us
how to handle our
organized crime problem.

14:27.242 --> 14:29.153
Booth said noth/ng.

14:29.244 --> 14:30.950
Two or three days,
just listening.

14:31.037 --> 14:33.653
He was quiet? That—
[Chuckles]

14:34.750 --> 14:36.661
That does not sound
like Booth.

14:36.752 --> 14:38.663
Then he asked a question.

14:38.754 --> 14:41.837
He asked, “How would
you gentlemen handle...

14:41.923 --> 14:44.881
our organized crime
problem?”

14:44.968 --> 14:46.924
He was respectful.

14:47.012 --> 14:49.128
That is the basis
ofyour friendship?

14:49.222 --> 14:52.840
That and a situation
Inc/ted by...

14:52.934 --> 14:54.845
a gallon of sake,
a police boat...

14:54.936 --> 14:57.143
- and Uruga Harbor at dawn.
-[Laughs]

14:58.190 --> 15:00.272
You’re a lucky woman,
Dr. Brennan.

15:00.358 --> 15:02.895
To work with Booth.

15:02.986 --> 15:05.443
I know.

15:05.530 --> 15:08.488
To work with Booth. Yes.

15:10.285 --> 15:12.401
Here you go.

15:12.496 --> 15:14.532
[Sweets]
So the-the mask didn’t
belong to the killer.

15:14.664 --> 15:18.327
It belonged to Nozomi,
Sachi’s roommate.
Okay. So?

15:18.418 --> 15:21.831
So perhaps the killer
wasn’t trying to
dehumanize his victim.

15:21.963 --> 15:23.874
Two coffees, please.
[Woman]
You got it.

15:23.965 --> 15:26.377
Well, maybe hejust had
a thing for girls in masks.

15:26.468 --> 15:28.459
- I mean, I get that.
- You do?

15:28.553 --> 15:30.669
Yeah.

15:30.764 --> 15:33.346
In an objective, evidentiary way.

15:34.184 --> 15:35.799
You had a point?

15:35.894 --> 15:38.476
Yeah. I think that
the killer was purposely...

15:38.563 --> 15:41.430
projecting Nozomi’s identity
onto his murder victim.

15:41.525 --> 15:44.892
Hey. So... I googled Tanaka.

15:44.986 --> 15:46.977
300 hits, all japanese.

15:47.072 --> 15:49.063
None with a personal pronoun.

15:49.157 --> 15:51.273
- Maybe we should just ask her.
- Him.

15:51.368 --> 15:55.361
Uh, you people can identify
human remains based on
a tiny little finger bone,

15:55.455 --> 15:58.288
but you can ’t/udge
the sex of a person
standing right in front of you.

15:58.375 --> 16:00.661
Does nobody else
see the irony in this?

16:00.752 --> 16:04.370
Of course.
But as a scientist,
I also see the challenge.

16:04.464 --> 16:07.126
Well, Dr. Tanaka
identifies with a subset...

16:07.217 --> 16:09.754
ofan urbanJapanese
aesthetic known as Ke/I
There you are.

16:09.845 --> 16:12.131

16:12.222 --> 16:14.429
Well, mission accomplished
there, Dr. Tanaka.

16:14.516 --> 16:16.677
You know, I think
you’re probably right.
We should just ask him.

16:16.768 --> 16:19.225
- Her.
- Tanaka won’t answer.
That’s the whole point.

16:19.312 --> 16:22.145
Gender is unimportant.
We should be mature enough...

16:22.232 --> 16:24.848
to accept Dr. Tanaka
just the way Dr. Tanaka is.

16:24.943 --> 16:27.434

You’re right. Who cares?
-Yeah. I mean,

Your record says
that you assaulted
Bruce Takedo.

16:56.558 --> 16:58.844
Those charges were dropped—
because the guy attacked me.

With a knife.
All I did was protect myself.

17:01.021 --> 17:02.807

I don’t know anything
about Sachi Nakamura,

17:39.601 --> 17:42.217
but, uh, Nozomi
booked a client last Friday,

17:42.354 --> 17:45.562
and I haven’t seen her since.
That’s the day that
Sachi Nakamura disappeared.

17:45.649 --> 17:47.640
- What’s the client’s name?
- Banker named Vogler.

17:47.734 --> 17:49.975

Excuse me?

17:58.578 --> 18:00.318

18:04.793 --> 18:07.535
[ Tanaka ]
There is a small scratch
to the left of the exit wound

18:07.629 --> 18:10.621
And the directionality is
outward from the midpoint
ofthe coronal suture.

18:10.715 --> 18:13.832
Whatever pierced the skull
must have splintered
back inside.

18:13.927 --> 18:17.294
Splintered? /t was a gunshot.
Don ’t you mean fragmented?

18:17.389 --> 18:20.005
There are no striations on
the cross-section ofthe exit wound.

18:20.141 --> 18:23.508
So she wasn’t killed
by a bullet?
That is my assessment.

18:23.603 --> 18:26.060
What could have been
driven through her head?

18:31.111 --> 18:35.855
Perhaps you can inform Booth
that the murder weapon
was not a gun.

18:42.998 --> 18:47.241
And we can x-ray the brain
to see ifwe find any
evidence of splinters.

18:47.335 --> 18:50.293
I ran the particulates from the C5
through the mass spec.

18:50.380 --> 18:52.962
Nematodes, turbellaria,
copepods— blah, blah, blah.

18:53.049 --> 18:55.131
All congruent with the marsh
where the head was found.

18:55.218 --> 18:57.254
I am not familiar
with the “bra, bra, bra.”

on the victim’s head

19:00.223 --> 19:02.555
- Now I truly do not understand.
- Totally lost.

19:02.642 --> 19:07.102
Okay. All right.
In salt marshes,
there are high marshes,

19:07.230 --> 19:11.018
low marshes and salt ﬂats.
Dr. Brennan found the head
on the low marsh.

19:11.109 --> 19:15.648
Yes, but that bird vomit
comes from Catoptrophorus
sem/pa/matus.

19:15.739 --> 19:17.900
A willet.

19:17.991 --> 19:20.448
The willet is a high-marsh
creature.

19:20.535 --> 19:22.742
But the cadaver dogs
are looking here
in the lo w marsh.

19:22.829 --> 19:25.696
They should be looking
here in the high marsh,
where the willet is found.

19:25.790 --> 19:28.782
- But that is miles away.
- Yeah, which is why we need
to call the search team.

19:28.877 --> 19:31.084
Why would someone cut
a head offa body here...

19:31.171 --> 19:34.208
and drive miles away
to dispose ofthe head here?

19:34.299 --> 19:36.631

in bird vomit.

back to Dr. Brennan so

[Brennan]
The marks on the vertebrae
will give us...

20:25.892 --> 20:28.429
a clear idea ofthe weapon
used to decapitate her.

20:28.520 --> 20:32.308
Dr. Tanaka can help me
prepare the brain
for “liquefication.”

20:44.619 --> 20:46.484
Perhaps he shouldn’t be here.

20:46.579 --> 20:49.366
If he doesn’t ask for help,
it would be an insult
for me to offer.

20:49.457 --> 20:52.324
It would imply weakness.

20:55.839 --> 20:59.172
I realize that staying here
shows great strength...

to your sister’s memory.

such a devoted brother.

Where’s the sword now?
Listen—
[Sharp Groan]

24:27.133 --> 24:31.251
God! I’m not saying
another word to you people
without my lawyer.

24:31.346 --> 24:33.712
Fine. That’s fine with us.
We’ll be in touch.

24:33.806 --> 24:35.797
Come on, Bones.

24:36.893 --> 24:39.179
[Sharp Groan ]

24:39.270 --> 24:42.228
- She’s a quick learner.
- Yeah. I/e/y quick

24:42.315 --> 24:44.897
[ Groaning]

24:44.984 --> 24:47.976
Hey. / d/d
a little research
on Strutt Photography

24:48.112 --> 24:51.195
I almost asked Tanaka.
No. Really?

24:51.282 --> 24:54.365
Not that it matters, but he—
she/he caught me staring.

24:54.452 --> 24:56.363
I didn’t mean to, but—
I had an opening, you know?

24:56.454 --> 24:58.365
But I didn’t know
how to lead off.

24:58.456 --> 25:00.868
IfI said he/she was a girl,
and he/she was a guy,

25:00.958 --> 25:03.210
he/she might be offended,
or other way around.

25:03.294 --> 25:05.751
Same thing. God.
I miss the ease
ofa simple pronoun.

25:05.838 --> 25:07.749
Yeah, tell me about it.

25:07.840 --> 25:09.831
All right, check out
Strutt Photography’s Web site.

25:09.926 --> 25:12.008
There’s a link
to additional services...

25:12.095 --> 25:14.427
which requires permission
and a password.

25:14.514 --> 25:16.596
I traced the LP. address,
and I found the FTP. site...

25:16.682 --> 25:18.422
that contains all the uploads.

25:18.518 --> 25:21.180
Then / bypassed
the pass word pro tection
by hacking into the server...

25:21.270 --> 25:23.010
where his Web address
is registered.

25:23.106 --> 25:24.687
Why do I feel like
my checking account isn’t safe?

25:24.774 --> 25:26.560
Look what Mr. Strutt’s
been hiding.

25:28.778 --> 25:31.235
[Saroyan ] These pictures

at Strutt’s studio.

25:31.322 --> 25:34.064
[Angela ]
it’s a long lens,
foreground objects—

25:34.158 --> 25:36.149
Probably taken without
the subject’s consent.

25:36.285 --> 25:38.196
Classic stalker photos.
Mm-hmm.

25:38.287 --> 25:40.414
If he was stalking Sachi—

25:40.498 --> 25:43.410
Maybe it wasn’tjust pictures
he wanted to shoot.

25:53.261 --> 25:55.377
Forgive me, Dr. Brennan,
but I must ask...

25:55.471 --> 25:58.508
ifyou are familiar
with the Shinto idea
of kam/I

25:58.641 --> 26:01.178
The spiritual essence
of an object.
Yes.

26:01.269 --> 26:03.851
Icannotdeﬁne
what is missing
from this skull—

26:03.938 --> 26:05.849
how its kami is incomplete.

26:05.940 --> 26:09.933
Maybe because the top
ofthe cranium
had been removed.

26:10.027 --> 26:11.938
Perhaps.

26:12.029 --> 26:13.940
I often find that
handling the bone...

26:14.031 --> 26:16.363
gives me insight
that pure science
cannot explain.

26:16.451 --> 26:18.407
I find that pure science
is the only thing...

26:18.494 --> 26:22.328
that gives satisfactory
explanations, Dr. Tanaka.

26:23.541 --> 26:27.500
There is something
with the temporal bone.

26:30.089 --> 26:32.671
Yes. The tympanomastoid—

26:32.758 --> 26:35.340
a swelling in the airspace.

26:39.515 --> 26:44.134
Tympanomastoid hemorrhaging
in the absence of
a bleeding diathesis.

26:44.228 --> 26:46.765
The victim was drowned.

26:46.856 --> 26:49.973
Very impressive, Dr. Tanaka.

26:50.067 --> 26:53.059
/t wasn ’t me.
It was the kami.

26:55.490 --> 26:58.277
Well, she wasn’t killed
by whate ver pierced
her brain.

26:58.367 --> 27:01.530
I aspirated her lungs.
Cause ofdeath was drowning.

27:09.295 --> 27:13.208
We need to determine
ifthe victim was drowned
in the marsh or somewhere else.

27:13.299 --> 27:15.665
No problem. I’ll analyze
the water samples
from the lungs.

27:15.760 --> 27:19.252
Now, I discovered
what the splinter
from the brain tissue is—

27:19.347 --> 27:21.508
Pseudosasa japonica.

27:21.599 --> 27:23.510
It’s arrow bamboo.
It’s ornamental.

27:23.601 --> 27:25.808
Only grows indoors
in this climate.

27:25.895 --> 27:27.681
Sharpened bamboo
could easily pierce a skull.

27:27.772 --> 27:29.808
[Saroyan ]
The girl was drowned first,

27:29.899 --> 27:32.686
a mask was put on her,
then she was decapitated...

27:32.777 --> 27:34.768
and her head was mounted
on a bamboo stake?

27:34.862 --> 27:37.399
Yeah, and then the head
was tossed into the marsh?

27:37.490 --> 27:40.106
Let’s find out what kind
ofwater was in her lungs.

27:53.256 --> 27:55.417
She was beautiful, wasn’t she?

28:00.054 --> 28:02.716
Yes, she was.

28:04.433 --> 28:06.719
A beautiful young woman.

28:07.812 --> 28:10.849
Which is probably
why she came to America.

28:10.940 --> 28:13.477
She felt like a woman...

28:13.568 --> 28:17.777
and wanted to be rid
ofa big brother watching her
all the time.

28:20.449 --> 28:24.533
My parents left
me and my brother
when I was 15.

28:24.620 --> 28:28.954
My brother was
the only family
that I had then,

28:29.041 --> 28:31.032
but he walked out
on me too.

28:31.127 --> 28:33.243
I’m sorry.

28:33.337 --> 28:36.329
I turned out quite well,
actually,

28:37.800 --> 28:41.509
but it would have
been nice to have had
a brother like you.

28:44.473 --> 28:46.429
According
to the FBI. logs,

28:46.517 --> 28:49.884
she called you every day,
often twice a day,

28:49.979 --> 28:52.971
and the conversations...

28:53.065 --> 28:54.976
never were less
than five minutes...

28:55.067 --> 28:58.559
and averaged 15 minutes.

28:58.654 --> 29:02.021
This has meaning for you?

29:02.116 --> 29:05.233
Objectively speaking,
it would indicate...

29:05.328 --> 29:08.286
an irrefutable desire
to connect—

29:09.957 --> 29:12.073
A deep and abiding love.

29:12.168 --> 29:15.786
I cannot imagine
never talking to her again.

29:18.382 --> 29:21.215
I myself have
no one in my life
whom I talk to that much.

29:21.302 --> 29:24.510
Outside of work, I mean.

29:24.639 --> 29:28.006
Perhaps that is good.
How so?

29:28.100 --> 29:30.807
I can see how much
pain you’re in.

29:33.356 --> 29:35.563
Is it worth it?

29:37.068 --> 29:41.812
To have your own happiness
so contingent upon
another human being?

29:43.574 --> 29:45.530
IfI was willing...

29:45.618 --> 29:48.360
to give up my life
for Sachi,

29:51.832 --> 29:54.414
why would I not be willing
to risk my happiness for her?

30:04.804 --> 30:06.920

in Sachi’s lungs.

30:12.728 --> 30:16.721
So the victim wasn’t drowned
in the salt marshes? She was
drowned in a water feature?

30:16.857 --> 30:20.020
Hey, the photographer has
a water thing in his lobby.
Feature.

30:20.152 --> 30:22.017
Water feature.
I’m not gonna say “feature.”

30:22.113 --> 30:25.150
It’sjust weird, okay?
I’ll say pond or pool.

30:25.241 --> 30:27.357
- Orthing.
- All right, wishing well.
Can wejust move on?

30:27.451 --> 30:29.703
Hodgins, ifwe had a sample,

30:29.829 --> 30:32.821
could you isolate
a single water feature?
Yeah, I could match profiles.

30:32.915 --> 30:35.531
Ifyou think the photographer
is the killer, I want to be there.

30:35.626 --> 30:37.582

from the jeffersonian,

30:37.670 --> 30:40.286

affecting auditory acuteness.

30:54.979 --> 30:57.436
Medical fact. Look it up.

31:02.945 --> 31:07.530
Okay, I thought you only did
one shoot with Sachi Nakamura.

31:07.616 --> 31:10.653
Okay, look, this is getting
totally out of hand.

31:10.786 --> 31:13.402
Maybe I should get a lawyer.
What’s your connection
withJames Sok?

31:14.457 --> 31:16.368
All I do
is give him names, man.

31:16.459 --> 31:18.791
- What names?
- Names of girls who don’t mind
doing nude shots.

31:18.919 --> 31:20.500
Oh, finder’s fee.
Yeah.

31:20.629 --> 31:22.244

whatJames Sok does with
these girls, right?

31:25.050 --> 31:29.635

He’s a pimp,
which makes you a pimp too.

31:29.764 --> 31:31.629
What about Sachi?
She wouldn’t pose nude.

31:31.724 --> 31:34.807
- What about these photos?
- Well, it’s a style, man.

31:34.894 --> 31:37.886

that she signed before
we even did it.

You wanna see ’em?

31:40.232 --> 31:43.349
Yes. Thank you.

31:43.444 --> 31:46.811
The water at the photographer’s
studio uses chlorine.

31:46.947 --> 31:49.154
So Sachi was not
drowned there?
No, sir.

31:49.241 --> 31:51.857
- You should inform Dr. Saroyan.
- Yeah, I already have.

I’d wanna hear everything
from the horse’s mouth.

31:55.539 --> 31:57.791
Thank you, Dr. Hodgins.

32:01.837 --> 32:04.795
Any luck with the Microsil?
Yes.

32:04.882 --> 32:07.464
I believe your
partly Chinese woman will be able...

32:07.551 --> 32:09.928
to reconstruct the tool
used to decapitate the victim.

32:10.012 --> 32:11.968
Uh, excuse me. Hi

32:12.056 --> 32:13.717
I heard that.

32:13.808 --> 32:18.848

In Japanese, that would not
sound so insulting.

I will complete my work
and give you the results.

32:26.195 --> 32:28.311
So how are you holding up?

32:28.405 --> 32:30.487
I should have known
the life she was living.

32:31.534 --> 32:33.525
Listen. Your sister
wasn’t a prostitute.

32:35.162 --> 32:37.574
Her roommate was.

32:39.041 --> 32:40.952
It was a warning.

32:41.043 --> 32:43.159
What was?

32:43.254 --> 32:45.836
Putting Sachi’s head on the spike.

32:46.882 --> 32:48.838
In feudalJapan,

32:48.926 --> 32:51.793
a traitor’s head was placed
on a pole as a warning...

32:51.887 --> 32:53.878
that others should
fear the warlords.

32:53.973 --> 32:57.886
Right. And she was wearing
her roommate Nozomi’s mask.

32:57.977 --> 33:01.094
Yes, because the warning
was meant for Nozomi

33:02.356 --> 33:04.392
Nozomi sees the head
and knows she must run.

33:04.483 --> 33:08.567
And she disposes of it
so that no one will think
that she killed Sachi

33:11.156 --> 33:13.568
But what did my sister do?

33:17.746 --> 33:19.782
IfSachi was a good girl,

33:25.838 --> 33:27.874
what did she do to get killed?

Picked up her roommate
trying to leave the country.

33:59.914 --> 34:03.452
She’s still pretty freaked out.
She saw her best friend’s
head on a spike.

34:03.542 --> 34:05.703
Trauma like that
could take years
to assimilate.

35:36.010 --> 35:38.752
We got the general shape
from Dr. Tanaka ’5 cast,

35:38.846 --> 35:40.757
but we still need
to fill in the details.

35:40.848 --> 35:43.510
Does the basic shape
resemble a katana sword...

35:43.642 --> 35:47.260
or aJapanese dough knife?
Well, it’s too early
to say.

35:47.354 --> 35:49.731
The prominent residual striae
indicate that a power tool
was not used,

35:49.815 --> 35:51.726
and that the blade
was curved.

35:51.817 --> 35:53.773
It has a combination
of serrated and plain edging.

35:53.861 --> 35:56.944
All right, so there goes
the katana sword.

35:57.031 --> 35:59.147
From the breakaway spur,
I could see that there are...

35:59.241 --> 36:02.574
approximately
six teeth per inch
on the serrated section.

- There also appears to be something...

in where it didn’t belong.

37:45.430 --> 37:47.842
Ifyou wanna know
who killed her,
you’ll cut me a deal.

37:47.933 --> 37:49.548
[Scoffs]
Right.

37:49.643 --> 37:54.103
You cut off her head
and you stuck it on a spike
to keep your girls in line,

37:54.189 --> 37:56.931
and you want me
to cut you a deal?

37:57.025 --> 37:59.186
Yeah. That’s right.

38:13.208 --> 38:15.620
What do you want to do, Nak?
Iwant to kill him.

38:17.713 --> 38:21.331
Look. He could give us
Sachi’s murderer.

38:21.425 --> 38:23.416
And then he goes free—

38:23.510 --> 38:27.002
the man who put
my sister’s head on a spike.

38:29.641 --> 38:31.973
If I don’t cut this deal, then...

38:32.060 --> 38:34.551
her murderer could walk.

38:36.148 --> 38:38.981
This is your case, Booth.

38:39.067 --> 38:41.023
That one doesn’t matter.

38:42.196 --> 38:45.359
To me it does.
And it would to Sachi.

38:55.250 --> 38:57.161
Cut the deal.

39:02.132 --> 39:04.919
Paul Vogler.
He was a good customer.

39:05.010 --> 39:07.717
One of my best.
Always wanted Nozomi.

39:07.804 --> 39:10.591
But he liked to get rough—
sometimes maybe too rough.

39:12.893 --> 39:15.976
One day that girl Sachi
barges in to I/og/er’s place scream/ng,

39:16.063 --> 39:17.974
say/ng she was gonna call
her cop brother...

39:18.065 --> 39:20.397
if I/og/er e ver touched
her friend Nozomi again.

39:20.484 --> 39:22.691
I/og/er pushes her
Into his koi pond

39:22.778 --> 39:24.985
holds her do wn,
/ust to shut her up.

39:25.072 --> 39:26.983
Idiot kills her.

39:27.074 --> 39:28.985
He paid me
to clean up the mess.

39:29.076 --> 39:31.658
So, yeah, / put the girl’s head
in Nozomi’s apan‘ment,

39:31.745 --> 39:34.782
and Nozomi took off
He / knew she would

39:34.873 --> 39:37.785
/ had a business to save,
but / d/dn ’t k/l/ anyone.

39:37.876 --> 39:40.037
/t was I/og/er.

39:48.971 --> 39:49.380
[Match Strikes]

39:49.388 --> 39:50.969
[Match Strikes]

40:06.571 --> 40:08.482
Hey, Nak.

40:10.575 --> 40:12.952
Nozomi’s been cleared
to leave by Immigration.

40:13.036 --> 40:14.901
I’ll see that she gets home safely.

40:14.997 --> 40:19.411
- Thank you, Nak.
- And Sachi can rest with our parents.

40:19.501 --> 40:22.709
Ifthe teachings are correct,
she will be reborn.

40:22.796 --> 40:25.003
And Sok and Vogler
will have to answer for their actions.

40:25.090 --> 40:28.298
That is h/gh/y improbable.

40:29.344 --> 40:32.131
But I hope that it’s true.

40:33.181 --> 40:35.638
I am forever in your debt.

40:38.520 --> 40:42.729
My friend, one ofthose
good Japanese beers will bejust fine.

40:42.816 --> 40:44.977
Oh, / ’d prefer sake.

40:46.111 --> 40:48.648
Sake.

40:48.739 --> 40:51.481
We’ll let you know
when it’s time to go. Okay?

41:10.469 --> 41:12.881
[Hodgins]
So... no one asked Tanaka?

41:12.971 --> 41:15.053
[Sweets]
Doesn’t matter, remember?

41:15.140 --> 41:17.051
Yeah. Yeah. No, I know.

41:17.142 --> 41:19.224
It’s Tanaka’s life.
We are not children.

41:19.353 --> 41:22.140
Very good.
Oh, this is ridiculous.

41:28.570 --> 41:31.937
Hey, Haru. It was great
working with you.

41:32.032 --> 41:34.193
I hope to see you again soon.

41:45.420 --> 41:48.412
Okay then.
Have a great trip back.

41:49.424 --> 41:51.335
Okay.

41:59.434 --> 42:01.766
It moved. He’s a guy.

42:03.271 --> 42:05.262
Yeah.

42:10.445 --> 42:13.608
There. Huh?
Hey, it’s good for what ails ya.

42:13.698 --> 42:16.405
But usually in this situation,
we’d have alcohol.

42:16.493 --> 42:20.077
Which is exactly why
we should do this, okay?

42:20.163 --> 42:22.028
From time to time.

42:22.165 --> 42:24.781
Oh, no.
[Imitates Airplane]

42:24.876 --> 42:27.458
Yum, hmm? Here you go.

42:29.798 --> 42:32.414
Will he recover,
your friend Ken?

42:32.509 --> 42:37.219
From losin’ his sister?
Urn, well, you don’t recover
from something like that.

42:37.347 --> 42:40.464
You just survive.
People die.

42:40.559 --> 42:43.266
There’s a fault in the design
if we can’t recover from it.

42:43.353 --> 42:45.935
“Fault in the design”?
What are we, coffee pots?

42:46.022 --> 42:47.933
Mmm, Ijust mean that...

42:48.024 --> 42:50.561
we should be designed
so that we can handle the worst.

42:50.652 --> 42:52.608
We are des/gned that way

42:52.696 --> 42:55.608
We aren’t sent anything
that we can’t handle.

42:55.699 --> 42:58.611
I’m not convinced
that loving someone is worth it.

42:58.702 --> 43:01.364
I got a son, and it’s worth it.

43:01.496 --> 43:04.704
Even if he died?
Whoa. Bones, don’t even
say that like that.

43:04.791 --> 43:06.577
Don’t even put that
out there.

43:06.668 --> 43:10.661
It is worth it,
and everything around it
is worth it.

43:13.425 --> 43:15.381
Every moment—
Everything...

43:17.095 --> 43:20.713
is worth it,
so eat the ice cream
before it melts.

43:27.022 --> 43:29.058
I wish it was beer.
Right.

43:29.149 --> 43:31.060
Know what?

43:33.570 --> 43:35.526
Okay.

43:36.948 --> 43:39.485
You’re right.

43:39.576 --> 43:41.487
Now, this is what
I’m talking about.

43:41.578 --> 43:46.038
Good. We agree to understand
that this is worth it.

44:24.496 --> 44:25.906
What’s that mean?
