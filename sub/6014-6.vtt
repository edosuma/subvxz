00:02.400 --> 00:06.598
I have to tell you that I did get
some very exciting news recently.

00:08.119 --> 00:11.430
I don't know if I should tell you
what it is, because it's not definite yet.

00:11.600 --> 00:13.636
- Come on!
- Come on!

00:13.800 --> 00:16.360
Well, I will tell you
what I do know so far.

00:16.520 --> 00:20.513
According to the information that
I have in the envelope that I received...

00:20.680 --> 00:22.557
...it seems...

00:22.760 --> 00:25.991
...that I may have already won
some very valuable prizes.

00:26.560 --> 00:28.232
Well, thank you.
Thank you very much.

00:28.400 --> 00:30.709
Well, thank you.
It's very nice to hear that.

00:30.880 --> 00:33.269
But in all honesty...

00:33.440 --> 00:37.274
...I have to say, I didn't even know
I was in this thing.

00:37.760 --> 00:39.671
But according to the readout...

00:39.840 --> 00:43.674
...it looks like I am among the top
people that they are considering.

00:43.840 --> 00:45.398
That annoys me about sweepstakes.

00:45.560 --> 00:47.630
They tease you with,
"You may have already won."

00:47.800 --> 00:50.268
I'd like once for a sweepstakes
company to have some guts.

00:50.440 --> 00:52.795
Just tell people the truth one time.
Send out envelopes:

00:53.080 --> 00:55.594
"You have definitely lost."

00:56.640 --> 00:58.073
You turn it over, giant printing:

00:58.240 --> 01:00.435
"Not even close."

01:00.600 --> 01:02.556
You open it,
there's a letter of explanation:

01:02.720 --> 01:05.757
"Even we cannot believe how badly
you've done in this contest."

01:07.000 --> 01:13.074

01:16.480 --> 01:18.471
To the right.

01:20.560 --> 01:21.754
Boy, that took a while.

01:22.240 --> 01:25.277
- Don't get up.
- I'd like to help, but my neck...

01:26.560 --> 01:28.596
So how long has it been
in the basement?

01:28.880 --> 01:30.074
Since my grandfather died.

01:30.240 --> 01:33.118
I was supposed to send it
to my parents, but they didn't want it.

01:33.280 --> 01:35.111
They said get rid of it,
but I felt funny.

01:35.280 --> 01:38.238
And then I forgot about it.
It's been sitting there for three years...

01:38.400 --> 01:40.152
...until he saw it.

01:40.480 --> 01:43.517
All right, so just take what you want,
and let's get it out of here.

01:44.800 --> 01:45.949
What's in it?

01:46.120 --> 01:48.111
Grandpa clothes. I can't wear them.

01:49.360 --> 01:52.318
You want these? Knee socks.
You don't wear knee socks.

01:52.600 --> 01:54.477
No. Go ahead.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.195
Look at this place.
I can't wait to get it cleaned.

01:58.560 --> 01:59.993
I know somebody who'll do it.

02:00.160 --> 02:01.434
She's good, she's honest...

02:01.800 --> 02:05.918
No, Elaine's got this writer friend
from Finland. Rava.

02:06.080 --> 02:08.469
Her boyfriend goes to
Columbia grad school.

02:08.639 --> 02:09.834
And he's supposed to do it.

02:10.360 --> 02:13.432
Students can't clean. It's anathema.

02:15.040 --> 02:16.473
They don't like it.

02:17.120 --> 02:19.759
How long you been waiting to squeeze
that into a conversation?

02:22.640 --> 02:24.153
Now, this, I like.

02:28.400 --> 02:30.118
Wait a second.

02:30.840 --> 02:31.989
I can't believe this.

02:32.960 --> 02:34.188
- Let me see this.
- Wait, wait.

02:34.360 --> 02:37.591
- Let me just see it for a second.
- No. Come on, come on.

02:38.560 --> 02:41.313
- Oh, my God. It's exactly the same.
- What?

02:41.680 --> 02:44.513
When I was 10 years old, my parents
had this very same statue...

02:44.680 --> 02:46.875
...on the mantel
of our apartment. Exactly.

02:47.040 --> 02:50.237
And one day I grabbed it,
I was using it as a microphone.

02:50.400 --> 02:52.391
I was singing "MacArthur Park."

02:52.560 --> 02:55.358
And I got to the part about,
"I'll never have the recipe again"...

02:55.520 --> 02:57.431
...and it slipped out my hand,
and it broke.

02:57.600 --> 03:00.910
My parents looked at me like
I smashed the Ten Commandments.

03:01.080 --> 03:02.911
To this day, they bring it up.

03:03.080 --> 03:05.878
It was the single most damaging
experience of my life.

03:06.040 --> 03:08.759
Aside from seeing my father naked.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.798
- Come on, I saw it first.
- Kramer, I have to have the statue.

03:12.960 --> 03:15.315
- I got dibs.
- No dibs. I need the statue. Give it!

03:15.480 --> 03:17.232
Spread out.

03:17.400 --> 03:19.914
You numbskulls.

03:20.880 --> 03:23.599
Why don't you just settle it
like mature adults?

03:24.000 --> 03:25.991
- Potato man.
- No, no.

03:26.360 --> 03:29.113
No potato man. Inka-dink.

03:33.880 --> 03:35.279
Okay.

03:35.440 --> 03:38.352
- Yeah, start with me.
- Yeah. Good, good.

03:38.760 --> 03:43.038
Inka-dink, a bottle of ink
The cork fell out, and you stink

03:43.200 --> 03:45.350
Not because you're dirty
Not because you're clean

03:45.520 --> 03:48.876
Just because you kissed a girl
Behind the magazine

03:49.400 --> 03:52.073
- And you are...
- Wait a minute. No.

03:52.240 --> 03:53.673
...it
- What? What are you doing?

03:53.960 --> 03:56.713
No, no. Oh, okay. All right.
He's out, I get it.

03:56.880 --> 03:59.348
- No, no, no. I'm it. I win.
- No.

03:59.520 --> 04:01.317
He's it. He wins.

04:01.480 --> 04:02.674
It is good.

04:05.840 --> 04:07.159
Do over. Start with him.

04:07.320 --> 04:08.594
No, no.

04:08.760 --> 04:11.035
Come on, Kramer.
Now, you got the socks.

04:13.280 --> 04:15.589
All right, you can have it.

04:17.040 --> 04:19.713
Okay. I'm gonna take the suit...

04:19.880 --> 04:22.348
...and shoes...

04:22.520 --> 04:24.112
...and the hat.
- All right. Let's go.

04:24.360 --> 04:27.670
Hey, I look like Joe Friday
in Dragnet.

04:29.760 --> 04:32.479
I can't believe I won at inka-dink.

04:33.320 --> 04:35.038
- Come on, let's go.
- Yeah.

04:36.640 --> 04:39.200
- Aren't you gonna take it?
- I don't wanna carry it around.

04:39.360 --> 04:40.554
I'll pick it up later.

04:40.720 --> 04:42.551
What about your stuff?

04:42.720 --> 04:43.914
Okay.

04:49.120 --> 04:51.918
All right, let's go. Hey...
You know, you owe me one.

04:52.080 --> 04:54.674
- What?
- The inka-dink. You were it.

04:54.840 --> 04:57.912
- It's bad?
- It's very bad.

05:00.400 --> 05:02.391
If they don't let you be
my editor on this...

05:02.560 --> 05:05.120
...I go to another publisher.
It's that simple.

05:05.560 --> 05:07.437
- You told them that?
- Of course.

05:07.600 --> 05:10.876
Oh, this is so fantastic.
I don't know how to thank you.

05:11.360 --> 05:14.511
Where's this boyfriend of yours?
I can't wait much longer, I got a flight.

05:14.680 --> 05:16.079
He's probably caught in traffic.

05:16.240 --> 05:17.878
Or maybe he's dead.

05:18.560 --> 05:20.471
So, what do you write,
children's books?

05:22.200 --> 05:24.191
That's Ray.

05:26.480 --> 05:28.948
Greetings. Greetings and salutations.

05:29.120 --> 05:31.429
I beg your forgiveness.
My tardiness was unavoidable.

05:31.840 --> 05:33.751
Rava, my love.

05:34.240 --> 05:35.559
Elaine, dear friend.

05:35.720 --> 05:38.678
And you must be Jerry,
lord of the manor.

05:38.840 --> 05:40.751
My liege. A pleasure to serve you.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.149
All right.

05:45.040 --> 05:46.996
Well, we have to get back to work.

05:47.640 --> 05:48.914
I gotta get to the airport.

05:49.200 --> 05:51.509
Your palace shall sparkle
like the stars in heaven...

05:51.680 --> 05:53.113
...upon your safe arrival, sire.

05:54.560 --> 05:57.393
The toilet brush is under the sink.

05:58.400 --> 06:00.356
I don't feel comfortable
with a maid either.

06:00.520 --> 06:02.875
There's that guilt when someone's
cleaning your house.

06:03.040 --> 06:05.429
You're sitting on the sofa,
they go by with the vacuum.

06:05.600 --> 06:07.716
"I'm really sorry about this.

06:07.880 --> 06:09.996
I don't know why I left
that stuff over there."

06:11.520 --> 06:14.512
That's why I could never be a maid.
I would have that attitude.

06:14.680 --> 06:18.559
I'd find them, wherever they are.
"I suppose you couldn't do this.

06:19.280 --> 06:23.034
No, don't get up.
Let me clean up your filth.

06:24.000 --> 06:27.072
No, you couldn't dust.
Oh, this is too tough, isn't it?"

06:28.760 --> 06:30.318
He really did an amazing job. Look.

06:30.480 --> 06:33.278
He uncoagulated
the top of the dishwashing liquid.

06:34.680 --> 06:38.309
He cleaned out the bottom
of the little egg cups.

06:38.480 --> 06:39.879
Come here, look at this.

06:41.080 --> 06:43.355
He cleaned in the little one-inch area...

06:43.520 --> 06:46.239
...between the refrigerator
and the counter.

06:46.400 --> 06:48.595
How'd he get in there?

06:48.800 --> 06:50.870
He must be like Rubber Man.

06:51.080 --> 06:52.274
There's no Rubber Man.

06:54.120 --> 06:56.475
Why did I think there was
a Rubber Man?

06:57.760 --> 06:59.830
There's Elastic Man, Plastic Man...

07:00.720 --> 07:02.358
- I'm leaving.
- Where are you going?

07:02.520 --> 07:04.317
To Rava's. I gotta
pick up her manuscript.

07:04.480 --> 07:07.040
- Oh, wait, I'll go with you.
- Okay.

07:08.960 --> 07:12.748
Elaine, he Windexed
the little peephole.

07:15.560 --> 07:17.630
So the meeting with Lippman
is all set.

07:17.800 --> 07:19.518
He's the editor in chief.

07:19.680 --> 07:22.240
- I think because of your request.
- Demand.

07:22.960 --> 07:25.110
They're gonna promote me to editor.

07:25.280 --> 07:27.157
Darn tooting.

07:27.600 --> 07:30.751
There's Ray, late as usual.

07:31.560 --> 07:32.913
Well.

07:33.080 --> 07:35.992
This is an unexpected surprise.
And delight.

07:36.160 --> 07:38.515
The once and future king of comedy,
Jerry the first...

07:38.680 --> 07:39.908
...gracing our humble abode.

07:40.440 --> 07:42.556
Rava, we are in the presence
of royalty.

07:42.720 --> 07:43.948
Hey, Ray, listen.

07:44.120 --> 07:46.554
You really did a tremendous job
cleaning that apartment.

07:46.720 --> 07:48.517
But I didn't just clean
your apartment.

07:48.680 --> 07:50.750
It was a ritual, a ceremony.

07:50.920 --> 07:52.399
A celebration of life.

07:53.240 --> 07:55.834
Shouldn't you be
out on a ledge somewhere?

07:57.680 --> 07:58.874
He's funny.

07:59.040 --> 08:01.076
- Water's boiling. Are we having tea?
- Yes.

08:01.240 --> 08:03.276
Yes. Jerry?

08:05.360 --> 08:06.713
- Jerry.
- What?

08:06.880 --> 08:09.440
Ray, would you give me
a hand, please?

08:10.080 --> 08:12.355
Yeah, I'm coming.

08:20.880 --> 08:23.269
I think that's the statue
from my house.

08:23.440 --> 08:25.431
That looks like the statue
from my house.

08:26.560 --> 08:28.869
- What statue?
- I had a statue.

08:29.040 --> 08:30.393
You do? I never saw a statue.

08:30.560 --> 08:32.152
My grandfather gave me a statue.

08:32.320 --> 08:34.629
- Since when?
- What's the difference? That's the one.

08:34.799 --> 08:37.109
He ripped me off.
This guy ripped me off.

08:38.559 --> 08:39.788
Do you take sugar?

08:39.960 --> 08:41.951
- No.
- No.

08:43.200 --> 08:44.952
I can't believe it.
This guy ripped me off.

08:45.120 --> 08:48.112
- Do you realize what you're saying?
- Yes, this guy ripped me off.

08:48.280 --> 08:50.111
He stole that statue
right out of my house.

08:50.280 --> 08:52.157
Lemon?

08:52.320 --> 08:54.356
- Sure.
- Yeah.

08:55.560 --> 08:57.437
- Are you sure?
- Pretty sure.

08:59.040 --> 09:02.715
- 99-percent sure.
- 99-percent sure?

09:02.880 --> 09:07.908
Sweet elixir, its fragrant nectar
a soothing balm for the soul.

09:09.480 --> 09:11.311
Those are the pastries.
Take care of that.

09:11.480 --> 09:13.391
I'm gonna get Elaine the manuscript.

09:13.560 --> 09:15.551
The pastries.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.116
Maybe it just looks the same.
It's a coincidence.

09:21.280 --> 09:23.999
Coincidence? This guy's in
my apartment, and by coincidence...

09:24.160 --> 09:26.310
...he has the exact same statue
in his apartment?

09:26.480 --> 09:29.552
- I never saw any statue.
- I had a statue.

09:29.960 --> 09:31.871
What should I do?

09:32.040 --> 09:33.951
I'll call Kramer.
He can check my house.

09:34.120 --> 09:35.758
Oh, Jerry.

09:35.920 --> 09:39.674
- Don't blow this for me.
- Don't worry.

09:40.760 --> 09:43.069
Kramer.

09:43.240 --> 09:45.754
It's Jerry. Jerry.

09:45.920 --> 09:49.037
From next door.
Never mind where I am.

09:49.200 --> 09:51.270
Yes, Jerry Seinfeld.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.112
Ma, I told you...

09:55.280 --> 09:57.999
...just dip the bread in the batter...

09:58.160 --> 10:00.151
...and put it in the pan.

10:00.640 --> 10:03.313
Okay, bye. My mother.

10:03.480 --> 10:06.358
She forgot how to make
French toast.

10:06.520 --> 10:07.669
You know how mothers are.

10:08.200 --> 10:10.350
My mother left us
when I was 6 years old.

10:10.520 --> 10:12.715
All seven of us.
We never heard from her again.

10:12.880 --> 10:14.950
I hope she's rotting
in an alley somewhere.

10:19.200 --> 10:21.668
My mom's down in Florida.

10:21.840 --> 10:24.673
She's got one of those condos.

10:24.840 --> 10:27.513
Hot down there in the summer.
You ever been down there?

10:28.280 --> 10:29.838
I love these pastries.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.912
In Scandinavian mythology,
the pastries were the food of the gods.

10:33.120 --> 10:37.193
Listen, I just remembered, I'm...

10:37.360 --> 10:38.634
...getting a facial.

10:38.800 --> 10:41.519
Oh, I'll see you tomorrow morning.

10:41.880 --> 10:43.757
- How about dinner?
- No, I don't eat dinner.

10:43.920 --> 10:46.036
Dinner's for suckers.

10:49.720 --> 10:51.039
Yeah, okay.

10:51.200 --> 10:52.952
Thanks anyway. Bye.

10:53.360 --> 10:54.554
Nope.

10:54.720 --> 10:57.757
Cop says it's my word against his.
There's nothing they can do.

10:58.280 --> 10:59.474
Let's go get him.

10:59.640 --> 11:01.915
- Yeah, right.
- We can't let him get away with this.

11:02.080 --> 11:04.150
You realize how crazy
he had to be to do this?

11:04.560 --> 11:07.120
He knew I was gonna know
it's missing and that he took it.

11:07.280 --> 11:08.599
And of all things to take.

11:08.760 --> 11:11.672
I left my watch, tape recorder, stereo.
He's crazy.

11:12.280 --> 11:13.599
You wanna go get him?

11:14.320 --> 11:16.151
If he's crazy,
you should just forget it.

11:16.360 --> 11:17.554
Forget it?

11:17.720 --> 11:19.676
I already called my parents.

11:19.840 --> 11:22.149
I told them to expect
the surprise of a lifetime.

11:22.320 --> 11:24.709
My mother's making
her roasted potatoes.

11:24.880 --> 11:26.996
George, do you realize...

11:27.160 --> 11:30.391
...that Rava has asked me
to edit her book?

11:30.640 --> 11:31.993
Who is this Rava?

11:32.480 --> 11:34.072
I say we get him.

11:34.240 --> 11:37.357
- Let me just call him.
- I'll call him.

11:45.240 --> 11:46.389
Hello, Ray?

11:46.560 --> 11:49.711
Hi, Ray. This is Rava's friend,
Elaine's friend, Jerry.

11:49.880 --> 11:51.677
Yeah, the king of comedy, right.

11:51.840 --> 11:54.718
Listen, you know that statue
on your mantel...

11:54.880 --> 11:58.714
...the one with...? The blue lady?
Would you shut up?!

12:00.840 --> 12:03.798
Yeah. Oh, you don't want to talk
about it over the phone.

12:04.080 --> 12:06.275
You don't want Rava to hear.

12:06.440 --> 12:07.953
Yeah, I understand.

12:08.120 --> 12:10.076
You know the coffee shop
near my house, Monk's?

12:10.760 --> 12:13.354
All right, tomorrow, 1:00.

12:13.520 --> 12:14.794
Great. Okay, bye.

12:17.280 --> 12:18.838
All right, look. Look, look.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.434
- Let's say he stole it.
- Oh, he stole it.

12:22.320 --> 12:23.673
You can't do anything about it.

12:23.840 --> 12:25.432
The cops won't do anything.

12:25.600 --> 12:29.718
What, are you gonna go fight him?
Why don't you just forget it.

12:31.760 --> 12:33.113
- No.
- No.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.228
Thought you said 1:00.

12:42.400 --> 12:45.517
Relax. He's late. He's always late.
It's part of his m.o.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.353
Remember, don't take any crap.

12:47.520 --> 12:49.238
Yeah, yeah. Don't worry about it.

12:49.400 --> 12:51.118
- I'll be right here.
- That's comforting.

12:51.320 --> 12:53.276
He's coming.

12:53.480 --> 12:54.799
Ray.

12:54.960 --> 12:56.632
Jerry.

12:57.280 --> 12:59.840
I can't believe you asked me
about that statue.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.195
You know how much trouble
you could've gotten me in?

13:02.360 --> 13:04.920
- Well, l...
- Rava was standing right next to me.

13:05.080 --> 13:07.036
I never told her
where I got the statue.

13:07.200 --> 13:09.270
- I wonder why.
- Well, just give it back...

13:09.440 --> 13:10.714
...and I won't say anything.

13:10.960 --> 13:13.428
- Give it back?
- Yeah.

13:13.600 --> 13:15.875
- What are you talking about?
- What's he talking about?

13:16.040 --> 13:17.996
- I'm talking about the statue.
- Yeah, me too.

13:18.240 --> 13:19.958
- Give it back to whom?
- Me.

13:20.480 --> 13:21.754
- You?
- Yeah, me.

13:22.080 --> 13:24.310
- I'm not getting this.
- You already got it.

13:24.480 --> 13:27.916
Ray, I had a statue in my house.

13:28.080 --> 13:29.559
You were in my house.

13:29.720 --> 13:31.438
And then I saw it in your house.

13:31.840 --> 13:33.751
- What are you saying?
- What am I saying?

13:33.920 --> 13:35.831
Take a wild guess.

13:36.560 --> 13:38.551
Are you saying I stole your statue?

13:38.720 --> 13:40.950
- What a mind.
- Well, l...

13:41.120 --> 13:44.635
- I can't believe what I'm hearing.
- I can't believe what I'm hearing.

13:44.800 --> 13:47.473
For your information,
I got that statue in a pawnshop.

13:47.680 --> 13:49.193
- Pawnshop?
- A pawnshop?

13:49.360 --> 13:51.828
In Chinatown, with money I earned
cleaning apartments.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.389
- Cleaning them out.
- Oh, excuse me.

13:54.560 --> 13:55.595
Yeah.

13:56.160 --> 13:59.152
Look, Ray, you were the only person
in my house.

13:59.480 --> 14:02.074
What's behind this?
It's Rava, isn't it?

14:02.240 --> 14:03.434
Again with the Rava.

14:03.600 --> 14:06.672
- You want her.
- No, she's a little too cheery for me.

14:06.840 --> 14:09.912
She's from Finland, for crying out
loud. Finland! Do you understand?

14:10.080 --> 14:11.513
I know Finland. They're neutral.

14:11.680 --> 14:14.240
Is it me?
Do I rub you the wrong way?

14:14.400 --> 14:17.437
No, actually, I find you quite charming.
A bit verbose at times.

14:17.600 --> 14:20.433
"I find you so charming." You wuss.

14:20.800 --> 14:22.950
- Did you call me a wuss?
- What did you say?

14:24.040 --> 14:26.554
I said, "luss."

14:26.720 --> 14:29.029
I'm at a "luss."

14:29.200 --> 14:31.430
I'd love to take you to the pawnshop
where I got it.

14:31.600 --> 14:32.953
That's not necessary.

14:36.320 --> 14:38.515
You know, maybe it's not
that bad an idea.

14:38.800 --> 14:41.394
And I would love to.
Nothing would please me more.

14:41.560 --> 14:43.994
But unfortunately, the guy retired
and moved to Singapore.

14:44.160 --> 14:45.752
Singapore? Do you hear this?

14:45.920 --> 14:48.798
If you really want, maybe I can
contact the guy in Singapore.

14:48.960 --> 14:51.076
Have him make a Photostat
of the receipt...

14:51.240 --> 14:53.071
...and send it over.
- That's it.

14:53.240 --> 14:55.470
That's it! I can't take it.
I can't take it anymore!

14:55.640 --> 14:58.074
You stole the statue!
You're a thief! You're a liar!

14:58.240 --> 14:59.195
- George.
- Who is this?

14:59.360 --> 15:02.875
I'm the judge and the jury, pal.
And the verdict is, guilty!

15:03.040 --> 15:04.473
- What is going on here?
- Guilty!

15:04.640 --> 15:06.392
- Your friend is crazy.
- Oh, I'm crazy!

15:06.560 --> 15:09.120
- George, George.
- I've gotta get going. I have a class.

15:09.280 --> 15:11.919
Oh, a class, huh? A class.
At Columbia?

15:12.080 --> 15:14.719
Let me tell you something.
I called the registrar's office.

15:14.880 --> 15:16.836
I checked you out.
They have no record...

15:17.000 --> 15:19.195
...of a Ray Thomas at that school,
you liar!

15:19.360 --> 15:22.079
That is because I am registered
under my full legal name...

15:22.240 --> 15:23.673
...Raymond Thomas Wochinski.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.513
Ray Thomas is
my professional name.

15:25.680 --> 15:26.874
You mean "alias."

15:27.160 --> 15:28.912
You are starting to make me angry.

15:29.680 --> 15:31.079
Well...

15:31.440 --> 15:33.271
...that was bound to happen.

15:38.400 --> 15:41.312
I hope you think about
what you've done here today.

15:41.480 --> 15:43.835
And if you wanna call
and apologize...

15:44.000 --> 15:45.274
...you know where to reach me.

15:45.440 --> 15:47.829
- Hey, Ray.
- Yes?

15:48.280 --> 15:51.556
How did you get the goop out of
the top of the dishwashing liquid?

15:51.720 --> 15:53.995
It was like a brand-new nozzle.

15:56.320 --> 15:58.675
- Nervous?
- Why should I be?

15:58.840 --> 16:00.068
Yeah. Right.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.718
Your notes were very insightful.

16:03.240 --> 16:05.595
The book is great.

16:05.760 --> 16:06.954
Did you go out last night?

16:07.120 --> 16:10.954
No, we made love on the floor
like two animals.

16:11.560 --> 16:14.199
Ray is insatiable.

16:14.560 --> 16:16.073
They all are.

16:16.480 --> 16:17.993
Was Jerry?

16:18.880 --> 16:20.871
I can't remember.

16:25.120 --> 16:28.430
You know, Ray is very upset
over these accusations.

16:29.240 --> 16:31.356
I'm staying out of this one.
This is between them.

16:31.520 --> 16:33.112
I am not getting involved.

16:36.720 --> 16:37.914
So you think he stole it?

16:38.080 --> 16:40.469
You have to admit,
the circumstantial evidence...

16:40.640 --> 16:42.073
I admit nothing.

16:44.600 --> 16:47.831
Will you put that cigarette out,
please?

16:48.080 --> 16:49.798
I mean, he was in the apartment...

16:49.960 --> 16:52.076
...and then it's gone,
and it's in your apartment.

16:52.240 --> 16:54.231
- Maybe you think we're in cahoots.
- No.

16:54.400 --> 16:55.799
But it's quite a coincidence.

16:55.960 --> 16:58.235
Yes, that's all, a coincidence.

16:59.240 --> 17:00.434
Big coincidence.

17:00.600 --> 17:02.875
Not a big coincidence.
A coincidence.

17:03.040 --> 17:04.314
No, that's a big coincidence.

17:04.480 --> 17:05.753
That's what a coincidence is.

17:05.920 --> 17:08.480
There are no small coincidences
and big coincidences.

17:08.640 --> 17:10.631
No. There are degrees
of coincidences.

17:10.800 --> 17:13.108
No. There are only coincidences.
Ask anyone.

17:13.280 --> 17:15.555
Are there big coincidences
and small coincidences...

17:15.720 --> 17:17.358
...or just coincidences?

17:17.520 --> 17:19.829
Well?

17:21.040 --> 17:22.951
Will you put that cigarette out?

17:23.119 --> 17:25.315
Maybe I put it out on your face.

17:25.480 --> 17:27.117
It's just like Ray said.

17:27.280 --> 17:31.193
You and Jerry, you're jealous
of our love. You're trying to destroy us.

17:32.720 --> 17:35.837
Shouldn't you be
out on a ledge somewhere?

17:49.040 --> 17:51.190
Ma, will you stop?

17:51.520 --> 17:54.080
It's just a statue.

17:54.240 --> 17:58.870
How is it my fault? It was stolen.
I didn't even touch it this time.

17:59.040 --> 18:01.110
Okay, fine.

18:01.280 --> 18:03.350
I don't see why this should affect
the potatoes.

18:03.720 --> 18:05.597
Okay! Goodbye.

18:07.840 --> 18:10.070
She doesn't react to disappointment
very well.

18:10.240 --> 18:11.434
Unlike me.

18:11.840 --> 18:13.432
I'm not happy about this.

18:14.240 --> 18:17.391
Why don't we just throw a
Molotov cocktail through their window.

18:17.560 --> 18:19.198
There's just no justice.

18:19.360 --> 18:21.112
This experience has changed me.

18:21.280 --> 18:23.840
It's made me more cynical,
more bitter, more jaded.

18:24.120 --> 18:26.588
- Really?
- Sure. Why not?

18:27.360 --> 18:28.588
How do you think I feel?

18:28.760 --> 18:32.639
Instead of editing the first novel
of a major young writing talent...

18:32.800 --> 18:36.998
...I am proofreading
a food-allergy cookbook.

18:37.360 --> 18:39.476
- Can't you talk to your boss?
- I did.

18:39.640 --> 18:40.959
He loves Rava.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.439
Worse, he loves Ray.

18:42.600 --> 18:44.318
And he doesn't think
you're funny at all.

18:48.160 --> 18:50.230
I'm not happy about this.

18:50.400 --> 18:52.595
Perhaps we can take comfort
in the knowledge...

18:52.760 --> 18:55.558
...that in the next world,
Ray will be the recipient...

18:55.720 --> 18:58.029
...of a much larger and more harsh
brand of justice.

18:58.240 --> 18:59.958
Yeah, he'll have my parents.

19:07.400 --> 19:09.356
Police. Open up!

19:10.080 --> 19:11.798
Police?

19:17.240 --> 19:18.434
- Freeze, mama!
- Hey, hey...

19:18.600 --> 19:20.591
Shut up! Spread them.

19:20.760 --> 19:22.193
I said, spread them!

19:22.360 --> 19:23.588
You're in big trouble, son.

19:23.760 --> 19:25.159
Burglary, grand larceny...

19:25.400 --> 19:26.753
...possession of stolen goods.

19:26.920 --> 19:28.319
- And murder!
- Murder?

19:28.480 --> 19:30.277
Shut up! Keep them spread.

19:30.440 --> 19:33.079
You just make love
to that wall, pervert.

19:35.080 --> 19:37.753
Hey, I think you have me confused
with somebody else.

19:38.480 --> 19:39.674
- Is your name Ray?
- Yeah.

19:39.840 --> 19:42.115
Yeah, you're the punk I'm looking for!

19:44.800 --> 19:46.438
Hey. Hey, are you a cop?

19:46.600 --> 19:49.990
Yeah, I'm a cop. I'm a good cop.
I'm a damn good cop!

19:51.120 --> 19:52.917
And today's your lucky day, junior.

19:53.080 --> 19:55.275
Because I'm gonna let you off
with just a warning.

19:55.440 --> 19:58.557
Any more of this criminal activity,
and you'll be sorry. You got me?

19:58.720 --> 20:00.438
I don't know
what you're talking about.

20:00.640 --> 20:02.392
Good, good. Let's keep it that way.

20:10.560 --> 20:13.438
All right, all right.
What's the big hubbub, bub?

20:20.720 --> 20:23.154
Kramer, I can't believe it.

20:23.320 --> 20:25.356
- Oh, you're my hero!
- Yeah.

20:25.520 --> 20:27.875
- Kramer, what did you do?
- Well, let's put it this way:

20:28.040 --> 20:30.634
I didn't take him to People's Court.

20:31.680 --> 20:35.229
I feel like a huge weight has been
lifted off my shoulders.

20:35.400 --> 20:38.153
l... I feel happy!

20:38.320 --> 20:39.912
Kramer, I don't know
how to thank you.

20:40.080 --> 20:41.991
Well, I'll think of something.

20:44.640 --> 20:47.154
People are going to steal from you.
You can't stop them.

20:47.320 --> 20:49.914
But everybody has their own little
personal security things.

20:50.080 --> 20:54.437
Things that they think will foil the
crooks, you know, in your mind.

20:54.600 --> 20:57.558
You go to the beach, go in the water.
Put your wallet in the sneaker.

20:57.720 --> 20:59.517
Who's gonna know?

21:00.800 --> 21:05.191
What criminal mind could penetrate
this fortress of security?

21:05.600 --> 21:07.511
"I tied a bow.

21:07.680 --> 21:10.148
They can't get through that."

21:10.320 --> 21:13.915
"I put the wallet down
by the toe of the sneaker.

21:14.200 --> 21:17.158
They never look there.
They check the heel, they move on."
