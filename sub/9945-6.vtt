WEBVTT

00:03.520 --> 00:08.116
Tickets this way
for the Chatsworth Express!

00:08.200 --> 00:11.670
Come and watch pikeys
making a mess of the lives

00:11.760 --> 00:15.116
they were given by him upstairs

00:15.200 --> 00:19.193
and kids they're convinced
aren't actually theirs.

00:19.280 --> 00:22.238
What sounds on earth
could ever replace

00:22.320 --> 00:25.471
kids needing money
or wives in your face?

00:25.560 --> 00:27.949
Cos this, people reckon,
and me included,

00:28.040 --> 00:32.033
is why pubs and drugs
were kindly invented

00:32.119 --> 00:37.877
to calm us all down
and stop us going mental.

00:37.960 --> 00:41.509
These are Chatsworth Estate's
basic essentials.

00:41.600 --> 00:45.752
We are worth every penny
for grinding your axes.

00:45.840 --> 00:49.913
You shit on our heads,
but you pay the taxes.

00:53.480 --> 00:57.439
Imagine a Britain
without Chatsworth buccaneers

00:57.520 --> 00:59.875
who'd come on your face
for the price of a beer.

00:59.960 --> 01:03.794
Make poverty history,
cheaper drugs now!

01:03.880 --> 01:07.839
Make poverty history,
cheaper drugs now!

01:07.920 --> 01:09.114
FRANK LAUGHS

01:09.200 --> 01:11.509
Scatter.

01:11.600 --> 01:13.238
Party!

01:18.560 --> 01:21.836
<i>(Paddy) Used to know this fella -
Bobby Cash Machine we called him.</i>

01:21.920 --> 01:27.153
<i>Taxi driver. Terrible drinker as well,
every sense of the word.</i>

01:27.240 --> 01:30.277
<i>He was forever blacking out,
waking up in the weirdest of places.</i>

01:30.360 --> 01:33.591
<i>He once woke up in the basement
of Manchester Cathedral.</i>

01:33.680 --> 01:35.318
<i>No idea how he got there.</i>

01:37.640 --> 01:39.517
<i>Aye. The demon drink.</i>

01:39.600 --> 01:42.194
<i>That's a terrible thing, so it is.</i>

01:43.600 --> 01:45.397
KNOCKING AT DOOR

01:45.480 --> 01:47.675
Debbie!

01:47.760 --> 01:49.352
Get that!

01:50.840 --> 01:52.637
KNOCKING AT DOOR

01:52.720 --> 01:54.950
Frank!

01:56.280 --> 01:57.713
KNOCKING AT DOOR

02:05.520 --> 02:07.909
- Yeah?
- Ah, Phillip Gallagher in?

02:08.000 --> 02:10.434
- No, he doesn't live here any more.
- Lan Gallagher?

02:10.520 --> 02:11.032
Uh-uh.

02:11.120 --> 02:13.554
I presume Deborah Gallagher
has moved as well.

02:13.640 --> 02:15.551
Oh, no, she's here.
I'll give her a shout.

02:15.640 --> 02:17.915
No need. Just need
to see some proof, plus,

02:18.000 --> 02:22.551
there's a Liam Gallagher
and a Stella Gallagher as well, correct?

02:22.640 --> 02:24.790
Can I ask what this is about?

02:24.880 --> 02:26.916
Ah. Bernard White. Benefits officer.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.514
Oh. Just a minute, please.

02:29.600 --> 02:32.512
- Frank, benefits!
- What?

02:32.600 --> 02:34.318
- At the door.
- Don't answer it.

02:34.400 --> 02:38.154
Like fucking vampires - they can't
get you if you don't let 'em in.

02:38.240 --> 02:42.791
It's too late, and I told him Lip
doesn't live here any more, or lan.

02:42.880 --> 02:43.471
So?

02:43.560 --> 02:46.279
So we're still collecting
benefits for 'em.

02:46.360 --> 02:47.509
That's not good, is it?

02:48.720 --> 02:52.110
(American) Got a dead man walking here.
And his wife.

02:52.200 --> 02:54.509
Dead wife walking, too.

02:59.080 --> 03:02.959
Hiya, I'm the, er, man of the house.

03:03.040 --> 03:04.758
Vernon Francis Gallagher?

03:04.840 --> 03:06.671
Yeah, look...

03:06.760 --> 03:10.469
What the wife was just saying,
just pay no attention to her.

03:10.560 --> 03:12.118
She's totally fucking gone.

03:12.200 --> 03:15.192
In days gone by, we'd have just
dragged her down the nuthouse.

03:15.280 --> 03:18.511
Now it's all care in the community
and all that.

03:18.600 --> 03:19.919
- Mr Gallagher.
- Yeah.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.833
Benefit theft is a crime,
not a joking matter.

03:24.760 --> 03:27.479
No. No, but look, can't we just
chalk this one down

03:27.560 --> 03:33.112
to a sort of clerical error,
bloody computers, that sort of thing?

03:35.000 --> 03:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:59.000 --> 04:00.513
What the fuck?

04:01.840 --> 04:02.989
Mornin', Meena.

04:04.080 --> 04:05.752
How are you?

04:05.840 --> 04:08.957
Well, a little bit tired
because of the party last night

04:09.040 --> 04:11.600
and sort of pissed off
because there was this cute guy,

04:11.680 --> 04:14.399
only Debbie got in there first
and he was all over her,

04:14.480 --> 04:17.471
but then she pulled her
"I'm not that sort of girl" thing.

04:17.560 --> 04:19.072
So he ended up buggering off,

04:19.160 --> 04:22.709
which was pretty pointless, because
she more or less ruined a good thing.

04:23.960 --> 04:26.554
And did you actually want
to know that,

04:26.640 --> 04:28.676
or were you just
making boring conversation?

04:28.760 --> 04:30.193
Boring conversation.

04:32.160 --> 04:34.071
What are your plans for today, then?

04:34.160 --> 04:38.438
Sit around on our sofa, feet up,
watching our TV, eating our food,

04:38.520 --> 04:39.999
like every other day?

04:40.080 --> 04:42.548
No. I've got places to go,
people to see.

04:42.640 --> 04:44.278
Yeah, course you do(!)

04:46.880 --> 04:48.313
Right, so let me recap.

04:48.400 --> 04:51.278
You're claiming for five children
who no longer live here.

04:51.360 --> 04:52.952
Neither of you
are actively seeking work.

04:53.040 --> 04:56.191
And despite what you said
on your form, Mr Gallagher,

04:56.280 --> 04:58.748
you're not confined
to a wheelchair.

04:58.840 --> 05:01.593
Disability - it's more
a state of mind, innit?

05:01.680 --> 05:05.070
- (Monica) Are we in trouble?
- I think that's safe to say.

05:05.160 --> 05:06.639
She was a lesbian.

05:06.720 --> 05:08.199
Sorry?

05:08.280 --> 05:12.034
For a while. Moved out on me,
living with that thing in the yard.

05:12.120 --> 05:12.916
And?

05:15.440 --> 05:17.829
Dunno, just, you know...

05:17.920 --> 05:19.319
thought it might help...

05:19.400 --> 05:22.198
get some compensation for it.
Oh, that's right,

05:22.280 --> 05:23.429
just walk away!

05:23.520 --> 05:24.953
You'll be hearing from us.

05:25.040 --> 05:28.510
Go on, back to your nice life and your
wife and kids. Want the shirt off me back?

05:28.600 --> 05:29.874
You can fuckin' have it,

05:29.960 --> 05:34.192
any fuckin' dreams I've had lately,
and me kid's nappies. Benefits!

05:34.280 --> 05:35.759
Benefits!

05:35.840 --> 05:39.469
Look around ya.
D'you see any fuckin' benefits?

05:39.560 --> 05:43.348
You know what you are?
A total fuckin' inadequate.

05:43.440 --> 05:46.477
Yeah, Germans had a word
for people like you. Hitler!

05:51.200 --> 05:53.555
HE SOBS

05:54.680 --> 05:56.432
Are you...

05:56.520 --> 05:58.750
crying?

05:58.840 --> 06:01.149
It's just... what you said...

06:01.240 --> 06:04.471
about being inadequate... you're right.

06:04.560 --> 06:06.630
Just like me wife said...

06:06.720 --> 06:08.472
when she left me this morning...

06:08.560 --> 06:10.232
Bloody hell.

06:10.320 --> 06:12.550
On me fucking birthday, too.

06:12.640 --> 06:15.154
- Did she at least get you a present?
- Yeah.

06:15.240 --> 06:17.356
There you go. Silver lining.

06:17.440 --> 06:20.910
A videotape of her doing
the bastard next door.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.230
Christ on a bike! Hey!

06:23.320 --> 06:24.912
Wait a sec, wait a sec.

06:25.000 --> 06:29.312
Can't let your birthday go by without
at least having a drink, can you?

06:29.400 --> 06:33.996
C'mon, you and me, no-man's-land,
pipes of peace.

06:34.080 --> 06:35.479
Hey, c'mon, eh?

06:36.760 --> 06:40.514
Just wait. I'll just get me jacket.
Just wait... there.

06:53.800 --> 06:55.677
HE LAUGHS

06:57.760 --> 06:59.671
Bring it on, sister!

07:02.160 --> 07:04.594
Mmm! Great news.

07:04.680 --> 07:07.399
Fat Donny's wife found out
about him and that lap dancer.

07:07.480 --> 07:10.040
Mmm. She took it dead badly, too.

07:13.160 --> 07:14.434
Aaaaaargh!

07:15.600 --> 07:17.477
Apparently, he was rushed to hospital

07:17.560 --> 07:19.755
with Little Donny stuck
in a bag of frozen peas.

07:19.840 --> 07:22.274
- You know what that means, right?
- What?

07:22.360 --> 07:24.794
Well, he played right-back, didn't he?
I'm off the bench!

07:24.880 --> 07:26.996
Terrible fuckin' news, more like.
You're shit.

07:27.080 --> 07:28.479
I'm not!

07:28.560 --> 07:31.154
Can't aim for arseholes.
And he's got no positional sense!

07:31.240 --> 07:33.959
Shane, shut the fuck up
and unpack the shopping.

07:34.040 --> 07:35.268
Eugh.

07:36.240 --> 07:37.229
Micky...

07:37.320 --> 07:40.437
- Yeah?
- The key to defending is zonal marking,

07:40.520 --> 07:42.829
none of this headless-chicken shite.

07:42.920 --> 07:44.717
Mark your territory.

07:47.760 --> 07:51.992
Never mind. Ask your dad to explain it
to you when he gets home.

08:01.240 --> 08:02.832
Maureen?

08:02.920 --> 08:05.150
Patrick.

08:07.560 --> 08:09.312
You're awake.

08:11.880 --> 08:14.952
What the hell's going on here?

08:15.040 --> 08:16.917
You're full of surprises.

08:18.880 --> 08:20.279
Now, c'mon, you can untie me now.

08:20.360 --> 08:24.114
Not that I'm complaining
about the kinky stuff, it's just...

08:24.200 --> 08:27.158
I don't even remember
how I got here.

08:27.240 --> 08:30.038
You had a little much to drink.

08:35.240 --> 08:37.275
BOTH LAUGHING

08:39.640 --> 08:43.428
So I thought it best
you stayed the night.

08:43.520 --> 08:44.714
What's this about?

08:44.800 --> 08:47.439
I'm hoping you can tell me, Patrick.

08:47.520 --> 08:49.112
That's really the point.

08:51.280 --> 08:52.838
That you understand.

08:56.080 --> 08:58.116
What do you think this is about?

09:01.160 --> 09:03.310
Got to admit,

09:03.400 --> 09:05.709
darlin', you got me stumped here.
How about a clue?

09:07.360 --> 09:08.509
Oooh.

09:10.440 --> 09:14.513
C'mon, Maureen, untie me now.
Enough is enough, huh?

09:17.640 --> 09:19.790
Maureen!

09:19.880 --> 09:21.393
Come on!

09:27.320 --> 09:28.514
Oi!

09:35.080 --> 09:39.471
Appreciate this, Mr Gallagher. Sorry,
I didn't mean to get so emotional there.

09:39.560 --> 09:40.595
No worries.

09:40.680 --> 09:45.674
It just gets harder to keep things
together, you know. Turning 40.

09:45.760 --> 09:47.557
The wife leaving.

09:48.760 --> 09:53.675
The job. I'm ashamed of meself -
what I've become.

09:53.760 --> 09:56.069
But it's never too late to change,
though, is it?

09:56.160 --> 10:00.438
A man in a position like yours
has got influence, power,

10:00.520 --> 10:02.238
you know, to help folk,

10:02.320 --> 10:05.630
like, you know, maybe people who made
a mistake on their benefit form.

10:05.720 --> 10:08.075
I can't ignore fraud, Mr Gallagher.

10:08.160 --> 10:10.833
What?! Come on, I'm joking...

10:10.920 --> 10:13.275
just talking generally here.

10:13.360 --> 10:16.432
God, what kind of scum
do you think I am?

10:16.520 --> 10:19.159
Sorry. I didn't mean to...
you know, snap.

10:19.240 --> 10:22.198
S'all right.
No harm, no foul.

10:22.280 --> 10:23.952
Er, two pints, Karen.

10:24.040 --> 10:26.838
- Same again?
- Yes, thank you...

10:26.920 --> 10:28.831
Frank.

10:33.720 --> 10:35.870
(And two Es, Karen.)

10:46.240 --> 10:48.435
The Buddhists are the fucking same,
you know.

10:48.520 --> 10:51.876
I mean, they don't give a diffing,
they're going to a better place.

10:51.960 --> 10:53.393
They're not scared of death.

10:53.480 --> 10:56.313
So me pubes are going grey and
I'm nearer the end than the beginning.

10:56.400 --> 10:58.834
But it's what
you're remembered for, innit?

10:58.920 --> 11:04.836
Like Geldof - shit songs, but he got
the kiddies fed. It's a proper legacy.

11:04.920 --> 11:06.797
Love, love...

11:06.880 --> 11:09.075
Iove, love...

11:09.160 --> 11:10.354
Iove.

11:10.440 --> 11:13.477
Yes... Yes...

11:13.560 --> 11:14.834
- Love.
- Yes.

11:14.920 --> 11:16.751
Yes. Yes!

11:16.840 --> 11:18.398
Yes!

11:24.280 --> 11:26.475
What the fuck you staring at,
you pervert?

11:33.040 --> 11:35.508
I think I'm drunk!

11:37.520 --> 11:38.748
MANIC LAUGHING

11:40.480 --> 11:43.392
I think I understand it all now, Frank.

11:43.480 --> 11:46.358
- Yeah?
- It's all about the love.

11:46.440 --> 11:48.670
You, me, everybody.

11:48.760 --> 11:50.239
Love.

11:50.320 --> 11:52.117
Love it is, Bernard.

11:52.200 --> 11:54.953
The treacle that binds us all together.

11:59.960 --> 12:02.110
Why did she do that?

12:02.200 --> 12:03.872
I just wanted to share my love.

12:03.960 --> 12:07.270
- I just need love.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy, tiger.

12:07.360 --> 12:12.275
Love you need
and love you shall have.

12:12.360 --> 12:13.998
All about the love, brother.

12:14.080 --> 12:19.200
All about the love. And then we can see
how you can help your fellow man.

12:19.280 --> 12:20.759
Yes.

12:20.840 --> 12:23.115
Thank you, brother.

12:26.720 --> 12:29.109
Christ, I hope we don't end up
married to that.

12:31.960 --> 12:34.030
That's nice. Is it real?

12:34.120 --> 12:36.509
Uh-huh. A gift.

12:36.600 --> 12:37.999
Jesus, he must be loaded.

12:38.080 --> 12:39.957
Treats me like a princess.

12:40.040 --> 12:40.950
Nice.

12:41.040 --> 12:44.999
- Yeah. A bit much sometimes.
- What d'you mean?

12:45.080 --> 12:46.479
Nothing.

12:46.560 --> 12:48.437
How's Jamie?

12:48.520 --> 12:49.999
Yeah. Better.

12:50.080 --> 12:53.117
"True love travels on a gravel road,"
and all that shite.

12:53.200 --> 12:55.316
We'll be all right, though.
No worries.

12:57.960 --> 13:00.349
We keep it simple
and we keep it tight.

13:00.440 --> 13:03.159
Get an early lead,
make them work for the ball.

13:03.240 --> 13:05.800
Play it out to the wings
and stretch them at the back.

13:05.880 --> 13:09.998
- Micky. Hello?
- Right, yeah... no probs.

13:10.080 --> 13:13.470
- Tight at the back. Wings. Sorted.
- Right, let's fuck 'em up, then!

13:13.560 --> 13:15.755
Yeah!
WHISTLE PEEPS

13:17.720 --> 13:20.712
THEY ALL SHOUT TO EACH OTHER

13:28.120 --> 13:29.439
GROANING

13:42.640 --> 13:43.595
Here we go.

13:43.680 --> 13:45.432
- Fuck's sake, Micky!
- What?!

13:45.520 --> 13:48.159
- Where were you?
- Midfield... ish.

13:48.240 --> 13:50.754
Right back! Right fucking back!

13:50.840 --> 13:54.594
All right. Keep yer hair on.
Fucking hippy.

14:10.320 --> 14:12.117
What's he pointing at?

14:19.120 --> 14:20.997
Fuck's sake, Micky!

14:21.080 --> 14:24.755
Shane, Shane, sort him out.
He's drifting everywhere.

14:24.840 --> 14:26.717
Mum, please! You're embarrassing me.

14:26.800 --> 14:29.553
- Can you get off the pitch, please?
- I'm his mother!

14:35.680 --> 14:38.399
Keeper, keeper...
where the fuck were you?

14:45.920 --> 14:46.875
Micky!

14:50.760 --> 14:52.398
All right, mate? How's it going?

14:52.480 --> 14:54.118
It's work. Remember that?

14:54.200 --> 14:56.475
Not all of us get
"compassionate leave".

14:56.560 --> 14:58.915
Not my fault you took
the prank wars too far.

14:59.000 --> 15:02.310
Post-traumatic stress disorder.
That's me all over - a victim.

15:02.400 --> 15:05.312
- Well, I'm pleased to see you, Stan.
- Cheers.

15:05.400 --> 15:08.676
Only happy because she got
a transfer, didn't she? Norfolk.

15:08.760 --> 15:13.038
A transfer? What about the flat?
You know, the three amigos.

15:13.120 --> 15:16.192
Us. All for one and one for all.

15:16.280 --> 15:17.838
That'd be the Three Musketeers,
then.

15:17.920 --> 15:21.037
You know what I mean. They offering
you a pay rise or something?

15:21.120 --> 15:22.075
I wish.

15:22.160 --> 15:24.833
Don't go, then. Norfolk. It's shit.
You'll be bored.

15:24.920 --> 15:29.710
Right. Cos hanging out with the Keystone
Cops was really working out for me(!)

15:33.040 --> 15:34.075
You're not doing a runner, are you?

15:34.160 --> 15:37.152
Nah. Still got things
worth sticking round for.

15:38.440 --> 15:43.116
I meant Debbie. Saw her earlier.
Still might be something there.

15:43.200 --> 15:45.760
I don't know.
I think she made it pretty clear.

15:45.840 --> 15:47.671
Stan, Stan. You don't know women.

15:47.760 --> 15:52.117
What I'm thinking is
some grand, romantic gesture.

15:58.280 --> 15:59.713
Three-nil.

15:59.800 --> 16:01.518
Three fucking nil.

16:01.600 --> 16:04.194
They're nothing special.
We can take 'em.

16:04.280 --> 16:08.398
Keep it tight, stay in position,
keep possession and, Micky...

16:08.480 --> 16:10.277
- Yeah?
- For fuck's sake.

16:10.360 --> 16:12.112
- What does that mean?
- Stop wandering about.

16:12.200 --> 16:15.192
- Just stay in defence.
- It's total football, you dick!

16:15.280 --> 16:19.068
It's the total opposite. Maybe we'd be
better off playing with ten men.

16:19.160 --> 16:22.948
He's your brother. He might be a twat
on the pitch, but family is family.

16:23.040 --> 16:25.554
Right, come on. Let's have it.
Come on!

16:25.640 --> 16:27.949
- Yeah, thanks, Mum.
- For fuck's sake, Micky.

16:29.840 --> 16:31.159
CHEERING

16:43.720 --> 16:44.675
CHEERING

16:55.760 --> 16:57.876
Three-two. Come on, boys!

17:03.960 --> 17:06.234
Micky, kick it, here.

17:06.319 --> 17:08.515
(Mimi) Pass, Micky, pass it!

17:08.599 --> 17:12.512
Micky. Bring it off, now! Micky! Micky!

17:16.560 --> 17:18.550
GROANING
You cock!

17:19.720 --> 17:22.632
You... play it. You're shit!

17:22.720 --> 17:23.675
You're shit!

17:24.839 --> 17:25.875
Well played.

17:28.440 --> 17:30.874
Come on! Showers! Showers!

18:10.960 --> 18:13.155
No, that's just creepy.

18:19.840 --> 18:22.035
- Tom!
- Shit!

18:25.040 --> 18:25.995
No...

18:26.080 --> 18:27.957
no, no, not what it looks like.

18:28.920 --> 18:30.751
No. Debbie!

18:47.440 --> 18:52.878
Micky, give it to me, give it to me now.

18:54.200 --> 18:55.235
Micky!

18:55.320 --> 18:57.390
Give us the fucking shower gel.

19:01.640 --> 19:05.155
- What the fuck you staring at?
- Could ask you the same question.

19:05.240 --> 19:08.073
It's the most attention you've paid
all fucking day.

19:08.160 --> 19:10.993
You're the one that's shit!
We'd have won if it wasn't for you.

19:11.080 --> 19:13.389
What the fuck you talking about?
All I said was...

19:13.480 --> 19:15.277
SHOUTING

19:34.560 --> 19:37.791
This is not what it looks like.

19:40.200 --> 19:43.192
There's been no funny business
going on.

19:45.840 --> 19:48.559
You are her husband, right?

19:52.720 --> 19:54.199
I was against her doing this.

19:56.640 --> 19:59.552
- I'm so sorry.
- Great, man.

19:59.640 --> 20:03.553
Good. So why don't you scoot over here
and untie us?

20:03.640 --> 20:05.312
I can't do that.

20:05.400 --> 20:10.076
Listen, I don't know what your kink is,
but it's going beyond a joke here.

20:10.160 --> 20:12.879
And it wasn't that funny
to start with.

20:12.960 --> 20:14.393
Untie me.

20:16.040 --> 20:18.235
I don't understand a fucking thing
that's going on.

20:18.320 --> 20:19.958
- You don't, do you?
- No.

20:20.040 --> 20:22.713
Then it's not my place to say.

20:24.960 --> 20:26.029
Enough.

20:26.120 --> 20:30.159
You walk over here,
you turn me loose.

20:30.240 --> 20:31.719
Last chance.

20:31.800 --> 20:36.555
You do that, I promise
I'll walk away. Won't look back.

20:36.640 --> 20:37.834
And if you don't...

20:39.440 --> 20:44.150
...I'll raze this place to the fucking
ground with you and her in it.

20:45.400 --> 20:47.675
You do as I say!

20:48.760 --> 20:51.115
D'you have any idea who I am?

20:51.200 --> 20:54.112
I know exactly who you are,
Mr Maguire.

20:55.760 --> 20:57.671
Stop. Don't go!

20:57.760 --> 21:01.070
(Shouts) Don't you walk away from me!

21:01.160 --> 21:02.639
Don't go!

21:02.720 --> 21:05.154
<i>Fu-u-u-u-ckl</i>

21:06.800 --> 21:09.837
Go on, it's all right. Don't be scared.

21:11.520 --> 21:14.557
- All right, Lillian?
- Looking for something special?

21:14.640 --> 21:16.995
Oh, it's not... All right, love?
No, it's not for me.

21:17.080 --> 21:19.640
It's for my compadre here. Yeah?

21:19.720 --> 21:24.157
- Hiya.
- What can I get for 30 quid?

21:24.240 --> 21:28.313
Thirty'll get you a Colombian Handshake
or a Paisley Snowjob.

21:28.400 --> 21:31.790
But for an extra tenner, I can chuck you
in a Yugoslavian Quarterpounder,

21:31.880 --> 21:33.552
which is popular with the young 'uns.

21:33.640 --> 21:37.030
Just, you know, a traditional
roll in the hay will be all right.

21:37.120 --> 21:39.873
- Go on, then, love.
- Go on, go on.

21:39.960 --> 21:43.270
- Come on, then.
- Everything is so lovely here.

21:43.360 --> 21:47.399
No rush, Bernard. You just
lose yourself up there, all right?

21:47.480 --> 21:51.234
We'll talk later.
All right, Leanne?

21:51.320 --> 21:53.754
- Fine, thanks.
- How's your gran?

21:53.840 --> 21:55.558
- She's all right.
- Great...

21:55.640 --> 21:57.631
LOUD VOMITING FROM UPSTAIRS

21:57.720 --> 21:58.914
Jesus!

21:59.000 --> 22:01.639
(Bernard) I'm so... I'm so sorry.

22:04.720 --> 22:07.393
Frank, I don't feel so good.

22:11.840 --> 22:14.434
I think we'd better
call it a night, then.

22:16.280 --> 22:18.111
I know there's someone there!

22:18.200 --> 22:21.670
Listen, I'm sorry.
Whatever it is you think I've...

22:21.760 --> 22:24.911
<i>Whatever it is I have done,
I'm sorry, OK?</i>

22:30.040 --> 22:32.235
Hello?!

22:33.320 --> 22:35.072
Please, I need...

22:43.160 --> 22:44.639
Fuck!

22:46.080 --> 22:47.274
KNOCK AT DOOR

22:57.040 --> 22:58.359
DOOR CLOSES

23:01.800 --> 23:05.475
Frank, what the hell's the benefits
officer doing in Debbie's bed?

23:05.560 --> 23:07.710
Ideally, waking up to a new life.

23:07.800 --> 23:10.155
One where the idea of helping out
his fellow man -

23:10.240 --> 23:12.993
ie, you and me, Monica -
is most appealing.

23:13.080 --> 23:14.672
What are you babbling on about?

23:16.440 --> 23:19.637
I tried to expand his horizons,
you know?

23:19.720 --> 23:24.271
Sort of, you know, slipped him
a couple of Es to change his world view -

23:24.360 --> 23:26.112
give him his own mini-Woodstock.

23:26.200 --> 23:29.909
You know, welcome to Spike Island,
leave yer preconceptions at the door.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.230
- And that worked, did it?
- Sort of.

23:35.080 --> 23:36.433
No, not really.

23:37.720 --> 23:38.948
Oh, all right! I fucked it.

23:40.400 --> 23:43.437
We're in the shit here, Monica.
It's not funny.

23:43.520 --> 23:47.513
It's not just cutting benefits off.
We're talking jail here.

23:47.600 --> 23:49.431
They don't send you to jail just for that!

23:49.520 --> 23:52.717
The place is teeming with 'em.
They don't fuck around.

23:52.800 --> 23:55.268
Come on, seriously.

23:55.360 --> 23:57.749
Strangeways, here we come. Again.

23:57.840 --> 23:59.876
No way. I can't do jail.

23:59.960 --> 24:02.030
I'm not wanting
to Steve McQueen it meself.

24:02.120 --> 24:04.270
Plus they're gonna take away the kids.

24:04.360 --> 24:07.796
You can wave goodbye to lickle Stella
up there, the house, everything.

24:07.880 --> 24:10.917
- Well, we've got to do something.
- All right.

24:12.400 --> 24:14.595
We've got the answer, though.

24:18.800 --> 24:23.351
Right here under our roof.
Lying there, in bed. Benefits Boy.

24:23.440 --> 24:26.432
Look, it's simple mathematics.

24:26.520 --> 24:29.193
He's lonely. His wife's left him.

24:29.280 --> 24:31.589
It was his fucking birthday.

24:33.120 --> 24:34.553
Well, he's vulnerable, in't he?

24:36.280 --> 24:42.435
We've just got to show him a bit of...
care and attention -

24:42.520 --> 24:43.748
bit of love -

24:43.840 --> 24:47.435
so that he bins our report
and we're back laughing again.

24:47.520 --> 24:50.910
- What you getting at?
- I'm just saying, you know...

24:52.520 --> 24:54.988
...we need to be creative.

24:55.080 --> 24:58.834
Maybe... you could do something.

25:00.960 --> 25:04.509
You know, be nice to him.
The old feminine wiles and that.

25:10.840 --> 25:12.273
Fine.

25:13.840 --> 25:15.751
Fucking fine.

25:21.080 --> 25:23.150
DOOR OPENS

25:24.680 --> 25:30.471
Good morning, Patrick. Sorry I wasn't
able to look in on you first thing.

25:30.560 --> 25:33.518
There was a bring-and-buy sale
at the church.

25:33.600 --> 25:36.353
Really, some of the junk
people drag there!

25:36.440 --> 25:39.557
SHE LAUGHS
How did you sleep?

25:39.640 --> 25:41.358
Why do you ask me that question?

25:41.440 --> 25:43.112
I don't understand.

25:43.200 --> 25:45.316
Like I've just popped round.

25:45.400 --> 25:48.836
Kettle's boiling.
Some fucking cucumber sandwiches

25:48.920 --> 25:52.469
daintily arranged on a plate.
You have me tied to a fucking bed.

25:52.560 --> 25:56.758
- Honestly... language!
- What is it you want from me?

25:58.120 --> 25:59.997
You tell me I've got to understand.

26:00.080 --> 26:05.313
I don't understand
what the hell it is you expect from me.

26:05.400 --> 26:08.517
You've soiled yourself,
haven't you, Patrick?

26:08.600 --> 26:11.512
Sorry. These things happen.

26:11.600 --> 26:13.158
No. No, they don't.

26:13.240 --> 26:16.676
Not unless some psycho bitch
has tied you to a fucking bed.

26:16.760 --> 26:17.988
They do happen!

26:19.600 --> 26:24.116
People found lying
in their own excrement, turned blue,

26:24.200 --> 26:27.033
<i>life thrown away - it happensl</i>

26:33.880 --> 26:35.154
I can make it easier.

26:36.800 --> 26:38.279
I could clean you up.

26:38.360 --> 26:42.239
And you must be thirsty by now -
really thirsty. Would you like a drink?

26:44.200 --> 26:46.839
If you don't answer me,
I can't get you one.

26:46.920 --> 26:49.434
A glass of water, Patrick?
Yes or no?

26:49.520 --> 26:50.669
(Yes.)

26:50.760 --> 26:52.432
Yes.

26:52.520 --> 26:55.830
Right, so you'll have to do something
for me, then, Patrick.

26:55.920 --> 26:57.672
Do you sing?

26:57.760 --> 26:58.875
What?

26:58.960 --> 27:03.351
I bet you do.
The Irish love singing, don't they?

27:03.440 --> 27:05.874
What beautiful voices.

27:05.960 --> 27:08.918
Or is that...
is that racist to assume that?

27:09.000 --> 27:11.150
How the fuck should I know?

27:11.240 --> 27:14.152
(Shouts) What did I say to you
about language?

27:17.160 --> 27:18.639
Sorry.

27:21.320 --> 27:22.355
I'm really sorry.

27:27.440 --> 27:31.479
I'm having a bad day.
It happens sometimes.

27:34.200 --> 27:38.955
Did you ever see the musical
Bugsy Malone?

27:39.040 --> 27:41.235
I saw the movie.

27:41.320 --> 27:42.753
Yeah, of course you did.

27:42.840 --> 27:48.710
Well, there's a song in it,
We Could Have Been Anything.

27:48.800 --> 27:50.552
I think it's... apt.

27:51.720 --> 27:55.838
Could you indulge me, Patrick?
Sing for me.

27:55.920 --> 27:57.751
I don't know the words.

27:57.840 --> 28:00.149
Of course you don't.
Hang on a minute...

28:05.040 --> 28:06.678
Ta-da!

28:09.560 --> 28:11.073

No, I never said

29:14.040 --> 29:16.429
Yeah, only cos you disturbed him.

29:16.520 --> 29:18.397
I'd have him hauled up for that.

29:18.480 --> 29:22.439
But that's just me. Unless, y'know...
you still fancy him.

29:22.520 --> 29:24.431
Shut up!

29:27.640 --> 29:31.076
So... when were you going to tell us
you were getting a promotion?

29:31.160 --> 29:34.709
Didn't think that was
anyone's business but mine.

29:34.800 --> 29:36.074
How did you swing that?

29:37.280 --> 29:38.838
Hard work.

29:38.920 --> 29:41.036
- Dedication.
- Yeah, right(!)

29:41.120 --> 29:44.078
Think I want to spend the rest
of my career wasting away in this dump?

29:44.160 --> 29:49.109
I made a choice. Sometimes
a girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do.

29:53.320 --> 29:56.756
Oh, before I forget,
Super wants to see you.

29:56.840 --> 30:00.355
What about?
Could you not have told me earlier?!

30:00.440 --> 30:02.874
Yes, Tom, I suppose I could.

30:02.960 --> 30:06.635
I suppose I could stick toothpaste
on your toothbrush every morning,

30:06.720 --> 30:09.280
and warm your slippers,
and wipe your smelly bum,

30:09.360 --> 30:11.430
and hold your hand
as you cross the road.

30:11.520 --> 30:13.795
But that's not my job.

30:14.960 --> 30:19.112
For too long
I've let you losers drag me down.

30:19.200 --> 30:22.112
So grow a brain
and work it out for yourself, eh?

30:29.520 --> 30:31.556
Right...

30:31.640 --> 30:32.993
See ya.

30:40.200 --> 30:41.349
KNOCKING

30:42.400 --> 30:45.278
I'll be out of your hair in a minute.
I'm really sorry.

30:45.360 --> 30:48.352
Don't worry about it.

30:56.280 --> 30:58.555
- Are you OK?
- No.

30:58.640 --> 31:00.790
I didn't mean to impose...

31:00.880 --> 31:03.713
It's nothing to do with you at all.

31:12.400 --> 31:16.109
It's OK. It's OK, don't worry.

31:22.080 --> 31:25.516
He's a fucking psycho. There's something
seriously wrong with him.

31:25.600 --> 31:27.352
Don't need to tell me. He's me brother.

31:27.440 --> 31:31.513
Mum'll go mental if you kick him
out the team. Not worth the hassle.

31:31.600 --> 31:33.989
There's a fella I know through work,
can barely walk,

31:34.080 --> 31:37.914
but he'd be up for a game. Stick Micky
on the subs bench and it's problem sorted.

31:42.560 --> 31:43.515
Yeah.

31:43.600 --> 31:45.431
- Problem sorted.
- Speaking of problems,

31:45.520 --> 31:47.590
- we've got one.
- What?

31:47.680 --> 31:50.194
We can either go
to that expensive French restaurant

31:50.280 --> 31:52.191
where they turn their noses up at us,

31:52.280 --> 31:54.510
or we can go to the expensive Italian one.

31:54.600 --> 31:57.068
Tell you what,
life's just full of problems!

32:13.760 --> 32:16.752
It's all right.
You can look if you want.

32:16.840 --> 32:17.795
Fuck off.

32:17.880 --> 32:19.598
- Don't bother me.
- Poof!

32:29.280 --> 32:31.111
I fucking knew it!

32:33.560 --> 32:34.549
Carl!

32:34.640 --> 32:37.279
- Stay away from me, you fuckin' psycho.
- Wait!

32:38.240 --> 32:40.515
For fuck's sake, Micky,
what have you done?

32:40.600 --> 32:42.352
What? It was an accident.

32:42.440 --> 32:44.874
You know. I slipped.

32:47.720 --> 32:51.474
Oh, yes, yes, oh, don't stop...

32:53.360 --> 32:54.554
You're beautiful.

32:54.640 --> 32:56.995
You don't have to say that.

32:57.080 --> 33:00.914
But you are. Sorry.

33:01.000 --> 33:02.638
Just...

33:02.720 --> 33:04.950
you are beautiful, you know.

33:09.480 --> 33:10.913
Oh...!

33:17.240 --> 33:19.708
I presume you know
what this is about.

33:19.800 --> 33:21.153
I do.

33:21.240 --> 33:22.753
There are certain things
we frown on here...

33:22.840 --> 33:27.709
Can I just explain? First of all,
it wasn't like I didn't know her.

33:27.800 --> 33:32.874
We used to go out. And OK,
I admit, you step back, you look at it,

33:32.960 --> 33:36.475
yes, she was 15 when I met her,
but I didn't do anything.

33:36.560 --> 33:38.152
And she'd testify to that.

33:38.240 --> 33:41.073
And yes, technically,
I let myself in to the house

33:41.160 --> 33:44.436
which, if you look at it in the wrong way,
you might see as breaking and entering,

33:44.520 --> 33:47.114
but I was just putting
the chocolate in the drawer.

33:47.200 --> 33:50.510
Then I thought, "No, drawer,
that's invasion of privacy,

33:50.600 --> 33:51.999
"I'll stick them on the bed."

33:54.480 --> 33:57.950
Then the pants got snagged and...

33:58.040 --> 33:59.234
voila.

33:59.320 --> 34:00.833
Pants?

34:00.920 --> 34:02.558
As in... underwear?

34:02.640 --> 34:04.232
Yeah.

34:04.320 --> 34:05.639
Of a 15-year-old girl?

34:05.720 --> 34:10.157
No. Debbie's 16 now.
Why would she say she's 15?

34:10.239 --> 34:13.596
I have no idea who she is
or what you're talking about.

34:13.679 --> 34:16.513
We are here to discuss
the circumstances

34:16.600 --> 34:19.956
which led to Stanley Waterman
having to take extended sick leave.

34:20.040 --> 34:22.998
We've received a report
about the incident

34:23.080 --> 34:26.389
which we feel lays the groundwork
for a disciplinary procedure.

34:26.480 --> 34:28.516
You've received a report?

34:29.760 --> 34:33.116
Sometimes a girl's gotta do
what a girl's gotta do.

34:33.199 --> 34:36.397
A blatant abuse of position
and waste of resources.

34:36.480 --> 34:39.391
But maybe you should start again.

34:39.480 --> 34:42.313
The other story sounds
far more interesting.

34:42.400 --> 34:44.594
So...

34:44.679 --> 34:47.034
there was a 15-year-old girl...

34:50.560 --> 34:52.197
Fucking hell.

34:56.960 --> 34:58.632
I'll, um... Goodbye, then.

34:58.720 --> 34:59.755
Wait, wait, wait!

35:01.480 --> 35:02.833
What happened?

35:02.920 --> 35:07.152
Our case is gonna disappear
down behind some filing cabinet.

35:07.240 --> 35:10.471
Really? Yeah! Fucking genius, Mon.

35:10.560 --> 35:12.755
Fucking genius.
How did you convince him?

35:12.840 --> 35:16.310
Don't think we need to go
into the gory details, do we?

35:16.400 --> 35:19.597
- What do you mean "gory details"?
- You know what I mean.

35:19.680 --> 35:21.557
I told you to speak to him.

35:21.640 --> 35:24.200
You told me to be nice to him.

35:26.040 --> 35:29.828
What you fucking talking about? Eh?

35:32.920 --> 35:34.273
Oh, no!

35:36.360 --> 35:38.749
Tell... tell me you didn't...

35:40.600 --> 35:42.033
It was your idea.

35:42.120 --> 35:43.553
No. No.

35:44.440 --> 35:47.079
Don't touch me. Don't come near me.

35:47.160 --> 35:53.474
You... upstairs? In my own house?
For fucking benefits?

35:53.560 --> 35:55.437
Benefits, Monica?

35:55.520 --> 35:58.830
Even prossies have the sense of mind
to do it for cold, hard cash...

35:58.920 --> 36:02.071
- Don't you dare turn this round!
- Don't you fucking start!

36:02.160 --> 36:04.879
You told me!
This is what you wanted!

36:04.960 --> 36:07.713
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah...
Of course it is(!)

36:07.800 --> 36:09.950
Of course it is.
Yeah, this is what I wanted(!)

36:10.040 --> 36:13.749
16 years of age, the world
unfurling at me feet, I said,

36:13.840 --> 36:19.278
"Hey, what I want is nine kids, a house
that's falling apart around me,

36:19.360 --> 36:22.750
"a wife who leaves me for another
fucking woman, comes back

36:22.840 --> 36:26.549
"and then fucks around on me again."
Oh, yeah, this is what I wanted!

36:26.640 --> 36:27.993
Don't... Fuck off!

36:32.120 --> 36:37.353
Yeah, I was on me knees, praying, "Oh,
please, grant my wish, your Almighty."

36:37.440 --> 36:39.829
And He did!

36:42.760 --> 36:46.196
I mean, this is heaven... with you.

36:46.280 --> 36:50.159
Every day, every second,
every breath.

36:50.240 --> 36:52.549
This is fucking heaven, this is!

37:05.280 --> 37:08.636
I did it for you.
I did it for the family.

37:08.720 --> 37:10.392
Don't, Mon.

37:10.480 --> 37:13.153
Just... just don't.

37:14.880 --> 37:18.316
From now on, Monica...

37:19.920 --> 37:22.957
...just don't.

37:25.760 --> 37:27.910
All right?

37:39.560 --> 37:40.913
It's OK, Paddy.

37:41.000 --> 37:42.558
It's OK. You're safe.

37:45.040 --> 37:47.395

Something's gotta give!

37:59.800 --> 38:01.836
I forgot.

38:01.920 --> 38:05.276
I forgot just how much
you meant to me...

38:08.720 --> 38:10.392
I love you so fucking much...

38:10.480 --> 38:13.392

I don't even remember how I got here.

38:18.840 --> 38:21.957

38:24.240 --> 38:25.798

Just wish you were better at football.
No need to go all psycho on us.

These DVDs. How many you got?

45:14.680 --> 45:17.399
Two hundred. Maybe more.

45:17.480 --> 45:20.119

46:14.120 --> 46:15.599
APPLAUSE

46:15.680 --> 46:19.559
<i>Another fella I knew, Duncan.

his mother, seriously,</i>

46:30.440 --> 46:32.795

46:41.720 --> 46:44.109

46:44.200 --> 46:47.078
<i>Might be others
who force your hand,</i>

46:47.160 --> 46:49.435
<i>or it might be something
within yourself.</i>

46:49.520 --> 46:52.830
<i>I guess you don't know.
Not until it hits ya.</i>

47:41.280 --> 47:44.033
