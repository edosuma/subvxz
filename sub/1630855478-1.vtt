WEBVTT

00:05.532 --> 00:07.403
Life is all about choices.

00:08.709 --> 00:10.189
We choose who we want to be.

00:11.407 --> 00:14.367
We choose
how we spend our time.

00:14.541 --> 00:16.847
And we choose
what is important to us.

00:18.588 --> 00:20.677
My name is Sam.

00:23.376 --> 00:27.336
That'’s Sarah,
my beautiful wife.

00:27.510 --> 00:28.946
We have a baby on the way.

00:30.252 --> 00:31.949
I have a tech start-up.

00:32.124 --> 00:35.257
It has potential
but not a lot of money.

00:36.693 --> 00:38.217
Sarah says I work too much.

00:38.913 --> 00:40.088
And she'’s right.

00:41.568 --> 00:44.092
It should be the happiest
time of my life...

00:46.790 --> 00:47.965
...but for some reason...

00:49.532 --> 00:51.056
...I am in turmoil.

00:58.585 --> 01:03.459
Hey.
You'’re gonna be okay.

01:22.826 --> 01:25.525
Sir, stay with me.
Keep your eyes open.

01:27.309 --> 01:28.702
Everything'’s gonna be okay!

01:35.230 --> 01:36.840
Everything'’s
gonna be okay!

01:38.755 --> 01:40.017
I love you!

05:25.112 --> 05:26.809
Help!

05:27.680 --> 05:28.985
Anybody?

05:29.159 --> 05:30.335
Help!

06:34.747 --> 06:35.791
Die!

06:37.314 --> 06:38.533
Come on!

06:40.753 --> 06:42.189
Die!

06:48.282 --> 06:49.457
Hey!

06:49.631 --> 06:51.416
Anybody!

06:51.590 --> 06:52.895
Help!

06:54.027 --> 06:55.550
Help!

07:29.584 --> 07:32.195
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

08:24.639 --> 08:26.336
What the fuck is going on?

08:49.751 --> 08:51.100
No fuckin'’ signal.

09:40.454 --> 09:41.498
Jesus.

09:41.673 --> 09:43.022
Can I help you?

09:46.329 --> 09:47.330
What'’s going on here?

09:47.504 --> 09:48.984
You rang the call button.

09:49.158 --> 09:50.377
I answered.

09:50.551 --> 09:52.161
What?

09:52.335 --> 09:54.250
You shouldn'’t have
gotten out of bed.

09:54.424 --> 09:56.383
You need to stay and rest.

09:56.557 --> 09:57.602
I was attacked!

09:57.776 --> 09:58.690
By who?

09:58.864 --> 09:59.865
By hi--

10:00.039 --> 10:01.518
What the fuck?

10:02.955 --> 10:03.999
He was just--

10:07.437 --> 10:08.613
No fucking way.

10:20.450 --> 10:21.495
Fuck!

10:46.172 --> 10:48.217
No fucking way.

10:58.184 --> 10:59.272
Come on!

11:03.842 --> 11:05.060
Come on!

11:55.894 --> 11:57.504
Fuck!

11:58.200 --> 11:59.375
Fuck.

12:01.769 --> 12:02.814
Help!

12:03.728 --> 12:05.077
Anybody!

12:06.252 --> 12:07.470
Hello?

12:57.564 --> 13:00.045
Hey. Hey. You'’re
going to be okay.

13:00.219 --> 13:01.655
I'’m gonna get
you out of here.

13:01.829 --> 13:02.874
This looks bad.

13:04.484 --> 13:05.964
The other guy
was drinking.

13:09.358 --> 13:10.533
Dead now.

13:10.707 --> 13:12.709
Hey. Don'’t listen to him.

13:12.884 --> 13:13.972
Just look at me.

13:14.842 --> 13:15.843
Look at me.

13:17.540 --> 13:19.325
Think you can reach up
and grab my hand?

13:39.388 --> 13:42.043
Anything to look
beautiful. Right?

13:43.610 --> 13:45.525
You already
look beautiful.

13:45.699 --> 13:48.049
Oh! You hear that, Doc?

13:48.223 --> 13:50.225
She'’s gonna put you
out of business.

13:50.399 --> 13:52.837
Oh, I'’m going to make you
even more beautiful.

13:53.011 --> 13:54.055
You better!

13:54.882 --> 13:57.058
Ass, nose, lips.

13:57.232 --> 13:58.973
Only have tits to go.

13:59.147 --> 14:02.890
You ready? Just relax
and look up at the light.

14:05.327 --> 14:07.634
She'’ll stop shining it
in your face any moment now.

14:07.808 --> 14:09.810
It is very annoying.

14:09.984 --> 14:12.726
Mmm. That'’s--
That'’s a bit bright.

14:21.866 --> 14:24.172
Now I want you
to count down from nine.

14:24.346 --> 14:25.739
Nine,

14:25.913 --> 14:28.481
eight, seven--

14:28.655 --> 14:30.309
Good. Keep going down.

14:30.483 --> 14:32.615
Six,

14:32.789 --> 14:34.835
five...

14:35.009 --> 14:36.315
four.

14:36.489 --> 14:38.752
Three,

14:38.926 --> 14:40.536
two,

14:40.710 --> 14:41.842
one.

16:02.270 --> 16:05.099
Help!
Somebody, help me!

16:05.273 --> 16:06.840
Help!

16:09.582 --> 16:11.540
Please! Please! No!

16:13.107 --> 16:15.936
No, no, no.
No, please. Help!

16:17.677 --> 16:19.287
Please! Please!

16:21.986 --> 16:23.291
Hey!

16:24.466 --> 16:25.598
Hey!

16:29.210 --> 16:30.603
Get away from her!

16:30.777 --> 16:33.127
Help me! Please!

16:35.695 --> 16:37.871
Don'’t come near me.

16:39.046 --> 16:40.265
I mean it!

16:56.194 --> 16:57.282
No!

16:57.456 --> 16:58.805
Hit her!

17:04.071 --> 17:06.552
What?

17:10.512 --> 17:11.513
Come on.

17:17.389 --> 17:19.434
Don'’t you fucking come near me.

17:22.829 --> 17:24.178
Run!

17:27.964 --> 17:29.096
That'’s right.

17:48.289 --> 17:49.464
What the fuck?

18:12.661 --> 18:14.402
Fuck.

18:15.273 --> 18:16.187
Are you all right?

18:16.361 --> 18:18.798
Um, I'’m, uh--

18:18.972 --> 18:20.887
I'’m not sure how
to even answer that.

18:21.061 --> 18:22.149
Me neither.

18:24.151 --> 18:26.458
I think you'’re the first
real person I'’ve seen.

18:27.372 --> 18:28.677
I'’m Sam.

18:29.548 --> 18:30.723
Monica.

18:32.290 --> 18:34.814
Who were those women?

18:34.988 --> 18:37.033
And-- And where
is everyone?

18:37.773 --> 18:39.558
I don'’t know.

18:39.732 --> 18:41.734
But we'’re gonna have
to figure this out.

18:43.866 --> 18:45.738
What'’s the last thing
you remember?

18:46.434 --> 18:48.175
Um, I, um--

18:49.089 --> 18:51.613
I was going into surgery,

18:51.787 --> 18:54.964
and-- and then I woke up
on the operating table,

18:55.139 --> 18:57.663
surrounded by them.

18:59.795 --> 19:01.362
Same thing happened to me,

19:02.363 --> 19:03.364
but without the "them."

19:03.538 --> 19:06.411
So, we'’re alone?

19:06.585 --> 19:08.239
You really haven'’t
seen anyone else?

19:09.327 --> 19:10.545
Not exactly.

19:10.719 --> 19:12.373
What'’s that
supposed to mean?

19:15.550 --> 19:20.076
A man in a coma woke up
and tried to kill me. Twice.

19:20.251 --> 19:21.252
W-- What?

19:21.426 --> 19:22.601
Look.

19:23.558 --> 19:24.951
We need to keep moving.

19:25.125 --> 19:27.127
- We need to get out of here.
- Okay.

19:27.301 --> 19:28.607
- Hey!
- What?

19:28.781 --> 19:30.174
Not that way.

19:30.348 --> 19:32.176
The sign says that'’s
the way to the elevator.

19:32.350 --> 19:35.614
Yeah? Well, the homicidal
coma man says otherwise.

19:36.528 --> 19:38.182
You need to trust me.

19:38.356 --> 19:39.922
We need to find
a different way.

19:41.533 --> 19:42.751
Let'’s go.

19:44.666 --> 19:45.667
Okay.

19:58.289 --> 20:00.465
Shit.
The phones are dead.

20:00.639 --> 20:03.032
It'’s a zombie apocalypse,
isn'’t it?

20:04.425 --> 20:06.253
It'’s not the zombie apocalypse.

20:09.038 --> 20:11.389
When I stabbed the coma man
in the head, he came back to life.

20:11.563 --> 20:13.695
But not before
he cleaned himself up,

20:13.869 --> 20:16.307
dressed himself again,
and then reappeared in his bed as if nothing ever happened.

20:16.481 --> 20:18.874
Okay, you are not
making me feel any better.

20:19.048 --> 20:22.922
So, what happens when
the not-zombies come back again?

20:23.096 --> 20:24.402
We'’ll be long gone.

20:25.446 --> 20:27.231
Put this on
in the meantime.

20:27.405 --> 20:29.276
Play doctor with you?

20:29.450 --> 20:31.670
You know what?
In the past, that would'’ve been a really good idea.

20:32.540 --> 20:34.412
Look.
You get me out of here,

20:34.586 --> 20:36.892
and I will be more than happy
to play in this one.

20:38.329 --> 20:40.809
Lady, as tempting
as that offer sounds,

20:40.983 --> 20:43.116
I'’m married,
and I really want to get back to my wife.

20:43.290 --> 20:44.335
Hello?

20:45.161 --> 20:46.772
- Hello!
- Who'’s that?

20:47.816 --> 20:49.514
No. No!

20:53.561 --> 20:55.476
Anybody
out there? Hello?

20:56.390 --> 20:58.827
- Hello?
- Hello! Yes! In here!

21:00.089 --> 21:02.222
Oh, thank God.
I thought I was gonna die here.

21:02.396 --> 21:03.354
What happened?

21:04.268 --> 21:05.486
The cops, t-t-the doctor,

21:05.660 --> 21:07.096
they all just left me
cuffed to this bed.

21:07.271 --> 21:08.620
What did you do?

21:08.794 --> 21:10.622
Nothing! I was shot,
then brought here,

21:10.796 --> 21:12.145
and I woke up
just like this.

21:12.319 --> 21:13.277
It'’s pretty fucked up,
ain'’t it?

21:13.451 --> 21:14.887
Who shot you?

21:15.061 --> 21:18.064
- A cop.
- No. We are not helping him.

21:18.238 --> 21:20.936
What? N-N-No!
I'’m not the bad guy here, I swear!

21:21.937 --> 21:23.896
Hey! We need
to stick together.

21:24.070 --> 21:25.506
I helped you, didn'’t I?

21:26.725 --> 21:28.379
Yeah. That'’s '’cause
I'’m not a criminal!

21:28.553 --> 21:29.945
Neither am I, lady!

21:33.253 --> 21:34.515
Stop!

21:34.689 --> 21:35.908
Stop!

21:39.825 --> 21:40.565
I'’m Carter.

21:40.739 --> 21:42.262
Sam.

21:42.436 --> 21:43.307
What'’s happening
out there?

21:43.481 --> 21:45.091
Nothing good.

21:45.265 --> 21:47.049
We need to get to the lobby
and then the exit. Can you move?

21:47.223 --> 21:49.878
- Yeah.
- How do we know you'’re not gonna try and kill us?

21:50.052 --> 21:53.055
How do I know you'’re not
gonna try and kill me? I saw you swipe that scalpel.

21:53.229 --> 21:55.319
Hey! Nobody'’s
killing anyone.

21:56.363 --> 21:57.364
You'’re gonna need this.

21:57.538 --> 22:00.106
- Fuck.
- Shit! You okay?

22:00.280 --> 22:02.282
Yeah, I'’ll live.

22:02.456 --> 22:03.370
Let'’s go.

22:03.544 --> 22:04.632
Come on!

22:10.377 --> 22:11.770
You better
not try anything.

22:11.944 --> 22:13.511
Aw, give it a rest, lady.
You'’re not my type.

22:13.685 --> 22:16.252
- Huh. Too pretty?
- Nah! Too extra. Damn.

22:34.619 --> 22:37.622
No!
Come on!

22:40.929 --> 22:42.104
Who the hell are they?

22:43.062 --> 22:44.411
Not-zombies.

22:58.294 --> 23:01.123
Shit! We'’re not gonna
make the elevator.

23:01.297 --> 23:03.387
Go for the stairs!
Move!

23:14.659 --> 23:15.703
It'’s not gonna hold!

23:15.877 --> 23:18.532
Go! Go!

23:29.369 --> 23:30.414
Let'’s go!

23:39.901 --> 23:40.946
Wait!

23:57.528 --> 23:59.051
You shouldn'’t be in there.

24:00.661 --> 24:02.228
There'’s smoke everywhere.

24:02.402 --> 24:03.534
There'’s gotta be
a fire somewhere.

24:03.708 --> 24:05.187
I saved you from it.

24:07.625 --> 24:09.931
My friends.
We have to help them.

24:10.105 --> 24:12.020
They'’re not your friends.

24:12.194 --> 24:15.197
You can'’t go down after them.
You can'’t go anywhere.

24:15.371 --> 24:17.591
Or else you will be
lost forever.

24:17.765 --> 24:19.201
Let go of me!

24:22.596 --> 24:24.076
He said let go of him!

24:34.782 --> 24:37.568
Hey. Stay with me.

24:37.742 --> 24:41.876
Stay with me.

24:42.050 --> 24:44.531
- Stay with me, Sam.
- Uh-huh.

24:45.271 --> 24:46.490
Welcome back.

24:46.664 --> 24:47.795
I'’m still here.

24:47.969 --> 24:49.536
Just trying to finish
some work.

24:49.710 --> 24:51.277
Oh, the horror

24:51.451 --> 24:53.192
of having to share
the morning commute with your wife.

24:56.195 --> 24:58.110
It'’s a nightmare.

24:58.284 --> 24:59.851
But I'’ll get over it.

25:00.025 --> 25:02.331
- Maybe even before
- the baby arrives. - Well, you better.

25:02.506 --> 25:04.246
Or else you'’re gonna
wake up an angry old man,

25:04.420 --> 25:08.512
with long, straggly hair,
crazy fingernails...

25:08.686 --> 25:11.036
I already wake up
an angry old man.

25:11.210 --> 25:13.734
And I'’d only be angry
if you weren'’t there.

25:15.431 --> 25:16.824
You work too much.

25:16.998 --> 25:18.609
Deep breaths.

25:18.783 --> 25:20.611
Stay the course.

25:20.785 --> 25:22.395
Tomorrow is important.

25:22.569 --> 25:24.266
But so is today.

25:25.311 --> 25:28.357
Okay. That'’s it.
I'’m all yours.

25:28.532 --> 25:30.229
Sorry. Too late.

25:30.403 --> 25:31.360
Oh.

25:31.535 --> 25:32.710
Love you.

25:34.755 --> 25:36.757
No texting and driving.

25:36.931 --> 25:38.411
Only when
I'’m texting you.

25:38.585 --> 25:39.891
Not even then.

25:40.065 --> 25:41.719
Do you remember
how to get back here tonight?

25:41.893 --> 25:44.025
Sure. GPS.

25:44.199 --> 25:45.505
Or you could
follow the signs.

25:45.679 --> 25:48.682
It'’s uptown,
not downtown, remember?

25:48.856 --> 25:50.902
I got it. Love you.

25:53.818 --> 25:56.472
- Call me if you get lost.
- Uh-huh.

26:07.309 --> 26:08.223
Hey.

26:08.397 --> 26:09.442
Okay, Sam...

26:21.585 --> 26:23.717
I should just take him
downstairs right now.

26:24.631 --> 26:26.154
Not as long as
I'’m here, you won'’t.

26:26.328 --> 26:28.809
He'’s a selfish, workaholic,
reckless womanizer

26:28.983 --> 26:30.550
who crashed
while texting and driving.

26:30.724 --> 26:33.335
You mean a good,
hardworking man

26:33.509 --> 26:35.207
and future father
who made some mistakes,

26:35.381 --> 26:36.512
who got hit
by a drunk driver.

26:36.687 --> 26:39.124
Fine.
It'’ll be his choice.

26:39.298 --> 26:40.865
Always.

27:07.935 --> 27:08.936
Oh!

27:09.110 --> 27:10.677
Fuck.

28:35.457 --> 28:36.850
Drop the wrench.

28:39.244 --> 28:40.288
Are you one of them?

28:40.462 --> 28:41.681
One of who?

28:41.855 --> 28:43.988
Whoever the hell
is trying to stop me

28:44.162 --> 28:45.729
from getting
out of this place.

28:51.169 --> 28:52.213
No.

28:52.997 --> 28:54.476
Do I look like one of them?

28:55.390 --> 28:56.827
Yeah, you got a face.

28:57.001 --> 28:58.611
That'’s a positive.

28:58.785 --> 29:01.048
I'’m assuming
you'’re not the one who patched me up.

29:01.788 --> 29:03.094
No. It wasn'’t me.

29:05.705 --> 29:06.967
You'’re a cop.

29:07.141 --> 29:08.708
Yeah.

29:10.318 --> 29:12.233
So what the hell
is going on?

29:13.408 --> 29:15.367
I don'’t know.
I can'’t get a signal.

29:15.541 --> 29:18.762
Neither can I.
All the lines are dead.

29:20.676 --> 29:22.635
Look, I sign
every birthday card,

29:22.809 --> 29:24.506
"See you at a hundred."

29:24.680 --> 29:26.291
I'’m gettin'’ out of this place,
no matter what it takes.

29:26.465 --> 29:28.989
Hey, look!
You'’ll get no argument from me.

29:29.163 --> 29:30.686
But the exit
is in the lobby,

29:30.861 --> 29:33.515
and let me tell you,
the elevator is dangerous.

29:33.689 --> 29:35.387
And there'’s smoke
all over the stairs.

29:35.561 --> 29:37.084
I think there'’s
a fire somewhere.

29:39.739 --> 29:41.915
Have you looked
out a window yet?

29:42.089 --> 29:43.264
What?

30:08.376 --> 30:09.551
Hey, boss.

30:16.036 --> 30:19.170
Yeah, I know it'’s
a bit of a stereotype, but I like '’em.

30:19.344 --> 30:21.781
Can I grab
a coffee there, as well?

30:30.877 --> 30:32.096
Hoodie.

30:38.972 --> 30:40.278
Don'’t move!

30:40.452 --> 30:41.888
Hands where I can see '’em!

30:42.062 --> 30:44.499
Down on your knees!
I'’m not gonna ask again!

30:44.673 --> 30:46.327
- Now.
- It'’s not him.

30:46.501 --> 30:47.720
You got the wrong guy, dude.

30:52.159 --> 30:53.987
Maybe it'’s a blackout.

30:54.161 --> 30:55.597
Maybe the whole
grid is down.

30:55.771 --> 30:58.513
What do you--
What do you mean, like terrorists?

30:58.687 --> 31:00.689
Or hackers.

31:00.864 --> 31:04.215
All hospitals have generators.
That would explain why we still have power.

31:04.389 --> 31:08.001
Maybe they evacuated everybody
before the generators kicked in.

31:08.175 --> 31:10.047
That'’s why
the hospital'’s empty.

31:15.748 --> 31:17.010
Seriously?

31:22.450 --> 31:23.495
Hey!

31:40.468 --> 31:41.426
Fuck!

31:46.779 --> 31:48.563
Whoa! Slow down there, son.

31:48.737 --> 31:50.478
You'’re gonna open up
those stitches.

32:04.449 --> 32:06.581
Unless, of course,
you'’re here to fix my sink.

32:08.496 --> 32:09.758
What?

32:09.933 --> 32:11.543
Well, you got a pretty
big wrench there.

32:11.717 --> 32:13.588
I was thinking, you know,
my sink'’s leaking.

32:13.762 --> 32:14.938
Maybe you could, uh...

32:15.112 --> 32:16.156
No.

32:17.505 --> 32:19.116
I don'’t fix sinks.

32:21.988 --> 32:23.816
Are you real?

32:23.990 --> 32:25.818
I mean, are you really here?

32:25.992 --> 32:28.125
Of course, I'’m here!
Aren'’t you?

32:29.126 --> 32:30.475
Yes.

32:30.649 --> 32:32.477
Thank God.

32:34.131 --> 32:36.002
People keep
disappearing on me.

32:36.176 --> 32:39.092
Well, I'’m not going
anywhere, son.

32:39.266 --> 32:40.746
Name'’s Virgil.

32:43.314 --> 32:44.837
Sam.

32:45.011 --> 32:47.448
Sam, huh?
Why are you still here, Sam?

32:48.928 --> 32:50.495
I'’m trying to leave.

32:50.669 --> 32:52.845
I need to find my wife.
She'’s pregnant.

32:53.019 --> 32:54.412
But I keep
getting attacked.

32:54.586 --> 32:55.891
Yeah.

32:56.066 --> 32:59.373
Well, you were bleeding
pretty badly there.

33:00.461 --> 33:01.941
Yeah, the, uh,
the wrench lady

33:02.115 --> 33:03.682
took you to that
room over there,

33:03.856 --> 33:05.814
and wanted to move
you downstairs,

33:05.989 --> 33:07.294
but, uh...

33:07.468 --> 33:08.817
...I wouldn'’t let her.

33:09.862 --> 33:11.168
She'’s the one
who saved me?

33:11.342 --> 33:12.996
She'’s the one
who stitched you up.

33:13.170 --> 33:16.477
And apparently,
uh, let you borrow her wrench.

33:16.651 --> 33:18.262
So where is she now?

33:18.436 --> 33:20.220
We need to get
out of here.

33:20.394 --> 33:23.093
I think there'’s a fire,
or a blackout, or worse.

33:23.267 --> 33:24.181
Worse?

33:24.355 --> 33:25.747
Well,
power'’s still on.

33:25.921 --> 33:27.053
Water'’s still running.

33:27.227 --> 33:29.055
We'’re both
still breathin'’.

33:29.229 --> 33:30.970
I'’d say
we'’re doing okay.

33:31.144 --> 33:34.278
Virgil,
I looked out the window.

33:35.540 --> 33:36.758
There'’s only darkness.

33:36.932 --> 33:39.370
And it'’s light in here.

33:39.544 --> 33:41.981
In a couple of hours,
the sun will come up.

33:42.155 --> 33:43.722
It'’ll be light
out there, too.

33:43.896 --> 33:46.072
Assuming we
survive the night.

33:46.246 --> 33:48.205
I can'’t explain this,

33:48.379 --> 33:50.772
but there are
dangerous things here,

33:50.946 --> 33:52.731
and they mean
to do us harm.

33:52.905 --> 33:54.820
I know.
I'’ve seen them.

33:54.994 --> 33:56.691
- You have?
- Yeah.

33:59.477 --> 34:02.045
I thought
I was going crazy.

34:02.219 --> 34:04.569
Monica,
one of the other patients,

34:04.743 --> 34:06.832
she thought it even
might be the apocalypse.

34:07.006 --> 34:08.747
The apocalypse?

34:09.791 --> 34:11.402
I don'’t think
that'’s what'’s going on.

34:11.576 --> 34:13.273
No one can get
a phone signal.

34:13.447 --> 34:16.885
Well, these old buildings
wreak havoc with reception.

34:17.060 --> 34:19.627
But I'’ll tell you what,
the higher up you go, the better chance you have.

34:22.413 --> 34:23.762
What about the roof?

34:24.719 --> 34:26.591
Now, that makes sense.

34:26.765 --> 34:30.073
Go up on the roof, get a signal,
find out what'’s going on, and...

34:31.030 --> 34:32.292
talk to your wife.

34:34.686 --> 34:37.080
Virgil, we'’re
getting outta here.

34:44.217 --> 34:45.610
There you are.

34:47.699 --> 34:49.483
Glad to see you
on your feet again.

34:50.223 --> 34:51.181
You helped me.

34:53.139 --> 34:55.359
Thank you.

34:55.533 --> 34:56.708
Thank me later.

34:57.970 --> 34:59.928
Did you just hear
those gunshots?

35:00.103 --> 35:01.147
Yeah.

35:01.321 --> 35:03.149
There'’s a cop.

35:03.323 --> 35:06.631
He said he'’d do
anything it takes to get out of here alive.

35:07.414 --> 35:08.633
I like him already.

35:09.547 --> 35:10.635
Let'’s follow his lead.

35:11.766 --> 35:13.377
Can I have my wrench back?

35:17.946 --> 35:18.991
Yes, ma'’am.

35:20.297 --> 35:21.646
It'’s Doctor.

35:21.820 --> 35:24.301
Or Lily.
But not "Lilith."

35:24.475 --> 35:25.954
I hate that name.

35:27.652 --> 35:29.219
Whatever you say, Doctor.

35:50.936 --> 35:53.330
No, shooting first
and asking questions later

35:53.504 --> 35:55.027
is not what we need right now.

35:56.550 --> 35:58.552
The cop did seem a little off.

35:58.726 --> 36:01.164
Really?
We'’ve been abandoned, the phones are dead,

36:01.338 --> 36:03.862
and there are
crazy monster-people trying to kill us.

36:04.036 --> 36:05.559
I'’m "off" too.

36:05.733 --> 36:07.474
We all are.

36:07.648 --> 36:09.650
I woke up from a nap
in the break room,

36:09.824 --> 36:11.435
and everyone was gone,

36:11.609 --> 36:13.176
except for Virgil.

36:13.350 --> 36:14.699
And then I saw
you getting attacked

36:14.873 --> 36:16.962
by a faceless orderly.

36:19.051 --> 36:20.444
Me and two patients...

36:21.706 --> 36:22.881
we tried the stairs.

36:24.056 --> 36:25.492
They were filled with smoke.

36:25.666 --> 36:28.234
The orderly pulled me out.

36:29.322 --> 36:31.498
Then let'’s hope
the elevator still works.

36:31.672 --> 36:33.108
We want to go up to the roof,

36:33.283 --> 36:34.849
especially if there'’s a fire.

36:35.023 --> 36:37.896
Fire or no fire,
we need to go down.

36:38.070 --> 36:40.290
Find the exit.
Find everyone else.

36:52.389 --> 36:54.347
The orderly'’s back.

36:54.521 --> 36:55.870
And he'’s found
his face again.

37:00.353 --> 37:03.269
He looks in pretty
good shape for getting a wrench to the head.

37:03.443 --> 37:06.098
- Yeah.
- Perhaps you should try talking to him

37:06.272 --> 37:08.187
before bashing him
in the head again, hmm?

37:08.361 --> 37:10.102
Talk to the man
with the vanishing mouth?

37:10.276 --> 37:12.017
She'’s right.

37:12.191 --> 37:13.932
That didn'’t work so well
the last time.

37:14.106 --> 37:15.629
Oh, was that
before or after

37:15.803 --> 37:17.457
he pulled you from
the smoking stairwell?

37:18.632 --> 37:19.677
Touché.

37:21.896 --> 37:23.898
You stay here.

37:24.072 --> 37:26.292
If he tries anything,

37:26.466 --> 37:27.467
bash him.

37:43.744 --> 37:44.963
Hello?

37:53.058 --> 37:55.278
My friends and I
would like to leave now.

38:43.804 --> 38:45.240
Help me!

38:51.551 --> 38:52.683
Wait!

38:57.470 --> 38:58.515
What happened?

39:00.125 --> 39:01.213
Did you see the girl?

39:01.387 --> 39:04.042
What girl?

39:05.348 --> 39:07.350
Come on.

39:12.180 --> 39:13.921
You shouldn'’t be here.

39:14.095 --> 39:15.358
We'’re leaving now.

39:15.532 --> 39:17.360
You shouldn'’t be with her.

39:19.144 --> 39:22.103
You shouldn'’t be with her!

39:22.277 --> 39:24.584
This conversation is over.

39:29.546 --> 39:33.332
Going downstairs
is a mistake that you will regret!

39:36.640 --> 39:37.554
Let him go!

39:43.908 --> 39:46.171
Get up to the roof!
Get help!

39:48.608 --> 39:50.088
No!

39:51.350 --> 39:54.005
Come on.

39:56.137 --> 39:57.225
We can'’t leave him!

39:59.053 --> 40:00.315
Crap.

40:00.490 --> 40:01.578
Virgil!

40:04.494 --> 40:06.931
Virgil? Virgil!

40:10.674 --> 40:12.415
Sam!

40:13.416 --> 40:15.461
Lily. I'’m sorry.

40:17.289 --> 40:19.160
We have to go. Ready?

40:21.293 --> 40:22.337
Let'’s go!

40:29.693 --> 40:31.346
We'’re supposed
to go to the roof.

40:31.521 --> 40:33.610
That doesn'’t make any sense.
We need to get out of here.

40:40.486 --> 40:43.184
No! Let me go!

40:43.358 --> 40:44.925
- Help!
- Lily!

40:45.099 --> 40:46.449
- Sam!
- Lily!

40:46.971 --> 40:48.451
Fuck!

41:29.492 --> 41:31.711
I promise you,
I didn'’t call her.

41:35.672 --> 41:37.500
You fucked up once.

41:38.979 --> 41:40.241
Don'’t do it again.

41:40.415 --> 41:43.027
- I'’m sorry.
- Temptation is your weakness.

41:43.201 --> 41:44.681
Was my weakness.

41:46.683 --> 41:48.685
Look,
I'’m a different guy now.

41:53.080 --> 41:54.908
I'’m different now.

41:55.082 --> 41:56.519
I changed.

41:57.824 --> 41:59.696
You made me
a better person.

41:59.870 --> 42:02.350
I know who I married,

42:02.525 --> 42:04.483
but it doesn'’t always
have to be about you,

42:04.657 --> 42:06.790
what you want,
what you need.

42:06.964 --> 42:10.271
I know.
Look. I'’m selfish.

42:10.445 --> 42:12.230
You don'’t have to be.

42:13.100 --> 42:14.101
Look.

42:15.581 --> 42:18.715
I'’m sorry. I get lost.
I get distracted. I get tempted.

42:18.889 --> 42:20.717
I don'’t know
what the fuck I'’m doing.

42:21.674 --> 42:23.415
But I don'’t
want to lose you.

42:24.024 --> 42:25.112
I'’m right here.

42:25.286 --> 42:26.549
I know.

42:27.811 --> 42:30.814
Our future child
is right here.

42:30.988 --> 42:31.989
I know.

42:34.774 --> 42:36.297
You'’re always trying
to help yourself.

42:37.690 --> 42:39.910
When are you gonna try
and help someone else?

42:40.693 --> 42:42.042
I'’m sorry.

43:05.109 --> 43:07.024
Who'’s chasing you?

43:11.115 --> 43:13.683
A ten-foot orderly
with no fuckin'’ face.

43:13.857 --> 43:16.381
Oh. So nothing crazy.

43:16.555 --> 43:17.904
I thought I'’d lost you.

43:19.253 --> 43:20.559
You did.

43:21.516 --> 43:22.430
We'’re all lost.

43:22.605 --> 43:24.650
There'’s no way out, Sam.

43:25.390 --> 43:26.652
We looked and looked.

43:26.826 --> 43:28.611
Carter left me
and he'’s still looking.

43:28.785 --> 43:30.221
But there'’s
no exit anywhere.

43:33.137 --> 43:34.660
Now you listen to me.

43:35.661 --> 43:37.620
You don'’t give up.

43:37.794 --> 43:39.317
There'’s always a way out.

43:40.231 --> 43:41.841
We just have to find
the lobby.

43:42.015 --> 43:44.496
This is the lobby.

43:52.809 --> 43:54.158
Oh, shit.

44:26.190 --> 44:27.887
Sam!

44:31.064 --> 44:32.718
- What'’s going on?
- Someone'’s coming!

44:32.892 --> 44:33.806
Shh.

44:48.212 --> 44:50.170
Faceless,
and now headless.

44:51.476 --> 44:52.825
You got away.

44:52.999 --> 44:54.218
He stuck his head
where it shouldn'’t be.

44:54.392 --> 44:56.176
The elevator doors
did the rest.

44:56.350 --> 44:58.178
I told you
they weren'’t safe.

44:58.352 --> 44:59.876
Who'’s your friend?

45:01.878 --> 45:05.882
Dr. Lily, Monica.
Monica, this is Dr. Lily.

45:06.056 --> 45:08.667
I'’m the one he was
playing doctor with before he met you.

45:09.537 --> 45:10.538
We'’re not playing.

45:15.674 --> 45:17.502
Son of a bitch!

45:19.722 --> 45:20.635
Hey!

45:24.204 --> 45:27.686
This is the lobby, isn'’t it?
So where are the main doors?

45:36.434 --> 45:37.478
What the...

45:51.231 --> 45:53.756
Well, at least we know
the air outside is real.

45:56.367 --> 45:59.457
Just checked the whole floor.
No exit doors anywhere.

45:59.631 --> 46:01.372
- You okay?
- Thankfully.

46:02.155 --> 46:03.374
Hey!

46:03.548 --> 46:05.463
You'’re the son of a bitch
who shot me!

46:05.637 --> 46:06.986
I knew it!

46:07.160 --> 46:10.033
I didn'’t shoot you,
you profiling asshole!

46:10.207 --> 46:11.208
- Hey!
- You shot me!

46:11.382 --> 46:12.513
Whoa.

46:12.687 --> 46:15.778
Take it easy. Hey!
Put the gun down.

46:15.952 --> 46:17.649
Your partner may have
pulled the trigger,

46:17.823 --> 46:19.607
but that'’s the same
in the eyes of the law.

46:19.782 --> 46:20.826
My partner?

46:21.000 --> 46:23.002
He was not my partner!

46:23.176 --> 46:26.701
You just assume every Black
dude in a goddamn hoodie is a fucking criminal!

46:26.876 --> 46:28.355
What,
now you'’re the victim?

46:29.704 --> 46:32.055
Give me the fucking money! Now!Whoa, whoa!

46:34.057 --> 46:35.058
Hurry up.

46:35.972 --> 46:37.712
Move, and you die.

46:40.977 --> 46:42.761
Can I grab a coffee there
as well?

46:43.675 --> 46:44.719
Hoodie.

46:45.851 --> 46:46.765
Don'’t move!

46:46.939 --> 46:48.332
Hands where I can see '’em!

46:48.506 --> 46:49.812
No, no...

46:49.986 --> 46:51.335
- Now!
- It'’s not him.

46:51.509 --> 46:52.815
- Now!
- You got the wrong guy, dude.

46:54.599 --> 46:56.035
Put your hands
behind your head.

46:56.209 --> 46:58.037
Get down on your fucking knees.

46:59.822 --> 47:00.823
Look out!

47:13.618 --> 47:14.662
I'’m sorry.

47:30.461 --> 47:31.723
He'’s getting away!

47:34.291 --> 47:35.248
Stop!

47:37.990 --> 47:39.339
Yeah, well, no shit.

47:39.513 --> 47:41.385
And so was the innocent lady
standing next to me.

47:41.559 --> 47:45.128
Hey! Nobody
is killing anybody.

47:45.824 --> 47:47.043
We'’re on the same side.

47:47.217 --> 47:48.958
No, no.
We'’re far from that.

47:49.132 --> 47:50.785
The Internet is down.

47:50.960 --> 47:52.744
All the landlines are dead.
There'’s no cell-phone signal,

47:52.918 --> 47:54.702
and none of us have found
a door to get outta here,

47:54.877 --> 47:56.487
and there'’s fucking creatures
trying to kill us!

47:56.661 --> 48:00.230
So I'’d say you, me and him--
we'’re on the same side.

48:07.280 --> 48:08.716
This is impossible.

48:09.717 --> 48:10.762
Hey.

48:11.806 --> 48:12.720
You'’re a cop.

48:12.895 --> 48:14.287
You'’re a logical guy.

48:15.245 --> 48:17.421
If what we'’re seeing
is impossible,

48:17.595 --> 48:19.597
maybe we'’re
not seeing it right.

48:20.163 --> 48:21.338
Lily.

48:22.426 --> 48:23.993
What did you give me upstairs?

48:24.167 --> 48:26.125
Antibiotics, adrenaline.

48:26.299 --> 48:27.648
You needed them.

48:27.822 --> 48:29.085
The pills are for the pain.

48:29.259 --> 48:31.565
I saw some empty vials
when I woke up.

48:31.739 --> 48:32.871
Maybe we were all drugged?

48:33.872 --> 48:35.308
Was I drugged, too,
in this scenario?

48:36.092 --> 48:37.789
Maybe.

48:37.963 --> 48:41.227
You told me you woke up from
a long nap in the break room.

48:41.401 --> 48:43.099
Anything could have happened.

48:43.273 --> 48:45.362
And now we'’re all having the
same hallucinogenic nightmare?

48:45.536 --> 48:48.974
Or maybe one of us is having
a hallucinogenic nightmare

48:49.148 --> 48:52.891
and the rest of us
are just figments of his or her imagination.

48:55.502 --> 48:57.591
Or maybe
we'’re all already dead.

48:58.766 --> 49:00.594
Oh, come on.
That'’s bullshit.

49:00.768 --> 49:02.901
How can you be so sure?

49:03.075 --> 49:04.685
Because
you'’re still breathing...

49:05.773 --> 49:06.818
and bleeding.

49:09.386 --> 49:11.823
None of us are dead.

49:11.997 --> 49:14.913
But this will not end well
unless we work together.

49:15.087 --> 49:18.090
I still don'’t trust him.
He was handcuffed for a reason!

49:18.264 --> 49:20.310
Yeah,
'’cause he'’s a criminal.

49:20.484 --> 49:22.181
Yeah, that'’s exactly
what we need,

49:22.355 --> 49:25.010
another racist pig
with a fucking gun!

49:30.711 --> 49:34.802
- What did you do?
- Hey! He is the reason that I'’m here.

49:34.977 --> 49:37.066
He doesn'’t get to leave,
but I do.

49:37.240 --> 49:39.677
- You killed him?
- Yeah! I killed him!

49:39.851 --> 49:43.420
'’Cause he'’s a criminal,
and he'’d have killed us if he had the chance!

49:43.594 --> 49:46.771
Okay? I'’m not dying
here. Not today.

49:49.600 --> 49:52.472
You. You work
here, right?

49:52.646 --> 49:54.518
How did you get in
if there'’s no doors?

49:54.692 --> 49:57.260
Through a door, asshole.

50:00.263 --> 50:03.005
Then take us to it.
Now!

50:04.310 --> 50:05.224
Let'’s go.

50:05.398 --> 50:06.660
Calm the fuck down.

50:07.705 --> 50:08.749
Let'’s go.

50:10.577 --> 50:12.840
I came in through
the employee parking garage.

50:13.624 --> 50:14.712
Basement level.

50:15.408 --> 50:17.019
Elevator or stairs?

50:17.193 --> 50:19.499
I took the elevator
straight up to my floor.

50:19.673 --> 50:21.153
All right,
assuming there is one,

50:21.327 --> 50:23.155
why didn'’t you come through
the main entrance?

50:23.329 --> 50:24.548
Because I have a car.

50:25.636 --> 50:27.768
She knows something
she'’s not telling.

50:27.942 --> 50:29.814
Like, why this lobby
has no doors.

50:29.988 --> 50:31.903
I was only filling in today.

50:32.077 --> 50:33.557
First time at this hospital.

50:34.558 --> 50:36.386
All right, basement it is.

50:39.867 --> 50:40.912
Wait.

50:43.219 --> 50:44.481
Where'’s the head?

50:46.352 --> 50:48.659
It was lying right here!

50:49.964 --> 50:51.053
It was here.

50:54.230 --> 50:56.493
Oh, shit!

50:57.320 --> 50:58.843
- Monica!
- Sam! Sam!

50:59.017 --> 51:00.062
Stay with me.

51:01.889 --> 51:03.108
We can'’t leave her.

51:04.066 --> 51:05.328
I'’m sorry, Lily.

51:05.502 --> 51:06.503
Monica!

51:06.677 --> 51:08.679
Hey, Mon-- Monica!

51:09.593 --> 51:10.637
Hey.

51:12.857 --> 51:14.076
You okay?

51:15.077 --> 51:17.557
This must be hell.

51:17.731 --> 51:19.733
No, it'’s not.

51:19.907 --> 51:20.995
This is a hospital.

51:21.170 --> 51:22.432
There'’s no way
out of here.

51:22.606 --> 51:23.433
Yes, there is.

51:23.607 --> 51:26.000
Monica, look at me.

51:26.175 --> 51:28.612
You have to trust Dr. Lily.
She knows a way out.

51:28.786 --> 51:30.614
What the fuck
is happening?

51:32.311 --> 51:34.444
Look, maybe--
maybe Carter was right.

51:34.618 --> 51:36.359
Look, maybe
we were drugged.

51:36.533 --> 51:39.405
But the longer we stay here,
the worse it'’s gonna get for us.

51:39.579 --> 51:41.146
We have to reach
the outside.

51:41.320 --> 51:43.670
We can get out through
the basement garage.

51:43.844 --> 51:45.890
The way I came in.
I promise.

51:46.064 --> 51:47.631
How?

51:47.805 --> 51:50.503
You know what'’s
waiting for us in those stairs.

51:50.677 --> 51:52.331
And we can'’t go back
to that elevator.

51:52.505 --> 51:54.855
No. Not that elevator.

51:55.987 --> 51:58.468
I know another one.
Come on.

52:05.475 --> 52:06.824
How'’d you know
this was here?

52:06.998 --> 52:08.260
I'’ve been here before.

52:08.434 --> 52:10.001
When I first woke up.

52:10.915 --> 52:12.003
It didn'’t go well.

52:12.177 --> 52:14.136
You said
we couldn'’t use this one

52:14.310 --> 52:16.050
because of
a homicidal coma man.

52:16.225 --> 52:18.009
Yeah, well, we have to.

52:18.183 --> 52:20.490
Let'’s hope
the homicidal coma man doesn'’t try to stop us.

52:21.708 --> 52:23.493
Get ready.

52:33.894 --> 52:34.982
Coma man?

52:36.680 --> 52:37.724
Yeah.

52:40.423 --> 52:43.600
You know,
too many of those pills can cause hallucinations.

52:44.905 --> 52:46.255
How many did you take?

52:47.343 --> 52:48.866
Not enough for this place.

52:51.564 --> 52:52.870
Excuse me.

53:13.282 --> 53:15.371
So where'’s this
parking garage, Doctor?

53:16.198 --> 53:17.721
It should be
down this hall.

53:21.246 --> 53:22.247
Guys?

53:23.292 --> 53:24.293
The morgue.

53:25.207 --> 53:26.251
Fitting,

53:27.339 --> 53:29.167
since we'’re all
probably dead.

53:34.868 --> 53:36.218
Hey, Monica.

53:40.178 --> 53:41.701
We need to keep moving.

53:52.103 --> 53:54.148
None of these people
made it out.

53:55.585 --> 53:57.587
Unfortunately,
not everyone gets to choose

53:57.761 --> 53:58.805
how they leave a hospital.

53:59.502 --> 54:00.807
I got to choose.

54:01.591 --> 54:03.810
To be here, I mean.

54:05.116 --> 54:07.423
I even paid
a lot of money to do it.

54:10.295 --> 54:11.862
For the chance to look...

54:13.167 --> 54:14.734
perfect.

54:27.051 --> 54:28.487
Monica,
what are you doing?

54:41.457 --> 54:43.459
I came in
for breast enhancement.

54:44.895 --> 54:46.636
But there'’s no incisions.

54:47.463 --> 54:48.551
No scars.

54:49.552 --> 54:51.162
No nothing.

54:51.336 --> 54:53.860
Maybe what happened
happened before you had the surgery.

54:55.906 --> 54:57.037
Maybe.

55:00.258 --> 55:02.434
But they'’ve never
looked this good.

55:04.697 --> 55:06.917
Hey, guys,
I got a dial tone.

55:08.048 --> 55:09.746
Hello? 911?

55:09.920 --> 55:12.226
911.
What'’s your emergency?

55:12.401 --> 55:16.535
Thank God.
Um, we'’re stuck in a hospital. It'’s an abandoned hospital.

55:16.709 --> 55:19.233
Somewhere in the city.
We'’re in the basement morgue.

55:19.408 --> 55:21.279
We'’re trying
to find the exit. I can'’t hear you, sir.

55:21.453 --> 55:23.325
Can you give me
an address? Hello?

55:23.499 --> 55:25.414
Hello! Hello?
Can you hear me?

55:25.588 --> 55:27.633
We'’re in a fuckin'’ hospital. Where, sir?

55:27.807 --> 55:31.681
I-I don'’t know where it is.
It'’s downtown. Um, somewhere in the city.

55:31.855 --> 55:32.856
Trace the call!

55:33.030 --> 55:35.249
Hello!

55:35.424 --> 55:36.729
Hel--

55:40.603 --> 55:41.691
Fuck.

55:46.217 --> 55:47.436
Sam?

56:05.758 --> 56:10.546
Whatever attacked me in that elevator is dead.

56:10.720 --> 56:12.809
Okay? Th-Th--
They'’re all dead.

56:14.550 --> 56:16.726
But we'’re not. Yet.

56:18.031 --> 56:20.033
Ain'’t that right, Doctor? Huh?

56:20.207 --> 56:25.865
Especially since
my gunshot wound is no longer there.

56:26.039 --> 56:27.737
I wouldn'’t get too excited.

56:27.911 --> 56:30.522
Looks like you still
have plenty of injuries to worry about.

56:30.696 --> 56:32.089
Yeah, maybe.

56:32.263 --> 56:36.267
But, like I asked you before,
take me to the exit.

56:37.877 --> 56:38.922
Now.

56:50.412 --> 56:51.848
This better be the way.

56:52.762 --> 56:54.590
It is.

56:54.764 --> 56:57.157
She'’s been trying
to get me out of here since I first met her.

56:57.331 --> 56:59.203
Oh, yeah?
Then why are you still here?

57:04.469 --> 57:05.557
That'’s why.

57:09.561 --> 57:12.564
I know of only one way out,
and there it is.

57:13.609 --> 57:15.567
Well, you guys
do what you want.

57:15.741 --> 57:17.047
I'’m going down there.

57:17.221 --> 57:18.570
See you at a hundred.

57:20.050 --> 57:20.964
I'’m with him!

57:21.138 --> 57:22.487
What about the fire?

57:22.661 --> 57:24.402
I'’m more scared of staying here.

57:24.576 --> 57:27.971
This is the way I came.
I know my way back. Trust me, Sam.

57:28.145 --> 57:30.016
You sure we can make it?

57:30.190 --> 57:31.453
If we stick together.

57:37.633 --> 57:38.938
There'’s got to be
another way.

57:39.112 --> 57:40.462
There'’s gotta be
another exit.

57:40.636 --> 57:41.941
We can make it, Sam.

57:44.291 --> 57:45.597
Fuck.

57:45.771 --> 57:47.164
Okay, let'’s go.

57:59.481 --> 58:01.918
No. No!

58:38.694 --> 58:39.651
No!

58:51.620 --> 58:53.186
I told you.

58:53.360 --> 58:57.321
I am getting out of here.
No matter what it takes!

59:07.810 --> 59:09.855
Guys! The elevator!

59:12.205 --> 59:13.772
Carter'’s body is gone again.

59:18.342 --> 59:21.084
Now'’s our chance,
while that thing is occupied.

59:21.258 --> 59:23.521
Did you not just see
what happened?

59:23.695 --> 59:26.480
Monica! Go for the stairs!

59:28.874 --> 59:30.006
Leave her.

59:30.180 --> 59:32.008
You and I can
get out together.

59:33.096 --> 59:34.619
I can'’t do that.

59:35.533 --> 59:37.448
We need to go
for the stairs.

59:37.622 --> 59:38.841
Come on.

59:40.190 --> 59:41.974
No. The exit.

59:46.370 --> 59:47.937
You'’re one of them.

59:49.503 --> 59:50.548
No.

59:51.593 --> 59:52.681
You'’re one of them.

59:53.943 --> 59:55.858
And there'’s only
one way out.

59:56.902 --> 59:58.817
Make that two ways.

59:59.557 --> 01:00:00.689
Virgil.

01:00:01.385 --> 01:00:02.952
Monica! Look at me.

01:00:03.126 --> 01:00:04.606
We gotta go, baby.
Come on.

01:00:04.780 --> 01:00:06.956
Go for the stairs.

01:00:07.130 --> 01:00:09.741
- I'’m so sorry, Sam.
- Don'’t be sorry.

01:00:09.915 --> 01:00:10.916
For all of it.

01:00:14.877 --> 01:00:15.791
Monica!

01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:19.142
Monica.

01:00:19.708 --> 01:00:20.796
Sam.

01:00:26.410 --> 01:00:27.454
You.

01:00:28.194 --> 01:00:29.587
I trusted you.

01:00:44.820 --> 01:00:45.995
Fuck.

01:01:01.924 --> 01:01:03.447
Monica was right.

01:01:05.014 --> 01:01:06.145
This is hell.

01:01:06.319 --> 01:01:09.671
No. It isn'’t hell or heaven

01:01:10.628 --> 01:01:12.369
or anywhere in between.

01:01:15.894 --> 01:01:17.026
What is it then?

01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:18.375
It'’s just a hospital.

01:01:20.986 --> 01:01:24.990
But some have been here
a lot longer than others. They just don'’t want to leave.

01:01:29.995 --> 01:01:31.823
I'’m not one of those people.

01:01:31.997 --> 01:01:33.607
That'’s good to hear, Sam.

01:01:34.870 --> 01:01:36.654
You chose
to get out of your bed.

01:01:36.828 --> 01:01:39.396
You chose to leave this--
this floor.

01:01:40.571 --> 01:01:42.704
What else are you
gonna choose to do next?

01:01:45.750 --> 01:01:47.621
I just want to get
out of this place.

01:01:56.108 --> 01:01:57.893
- No.
- What?

01:02:03.246 --> 01:02:04.726
I'’m going home.

01:02:17.564 --> 01:02:19.088
We'’re in the same place.

01:02:21.438 --> 01:02:22.744
Fuck!

01:02:24.658 --> 01:02:28.140
Well, at least
the orderly'’s gone.

01:02:32.797 --> 01:02:34.364
I really need
to talk to my wife.

01:02:34.538 --> 01:02:37.671
Now, there'’s an elevator
on each side of this hospital,

01:02:37.846 --> 01:02:40.762
but if we want to get
to the roof, we need to get to the other one.

01:02:42.502 --> 01:02:43.634
Right.

01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:51.729
Let'’s get the fuck out of here.

01:03:02.871 --> 01:03:04.611
Do you hear that?

01:03:04.786 --> 01:03:06.439
Yes, I do.

01:03:50.657 --> 01:03:51.833
Sarah?

01:03:57.099 --> 01:03:58.535
It'’s a girl.

01:04:02.669 --> 01:04:04.323
She'’s perfect.

01:04:06.369 --> 01:04:07.849
How'’s your head?

01:04:12.592 --> 01:04:13.898
It'’s okay.

01:04:15.421 --> 01:04:18.555
I'’ve been trying to get to you
from the moment I woke up.

01:04:19.512 --> 01:04:20.862
I'’ve never left.

01:04:22.167 --> 01:04:25.170
Remember, deep breaths.
Stay the course.

01:04:27.042 --> 01:04:29.087
How do I get out of here?

01:04:30.045 --> 01:04:33.875
Follow the signs.
Or use your GPS.

01:04:34.919 --> 01:04:36.094
Doesn'’t work in here.

01:04:42.753 --> 01:04:44.711
Then go to where it does.

01:04:49.716 --> 01:04:50.761
Sarah?

01:04:54.243 --> 01:04:56.680
Why are you
in this hospital, Virgil?

01:04:57.376 --> 01:04:59.422
I'’m old.

01:05:00.336 --> 01:05:01.424
Why are you?

01:05:04.862 --> 01:05:05.907
Car crash.

01:05:17.614 --> 01:05:20.225
I'’m dead, aren'’t I?

01:05:21.923 --> 01:05:23.968
I assure you,
you are not.

01:05:24.838 --> 01:05:26.536
Neither is anyone else here,

01:05:26.710 --> 01:05:29.234
at least not when
you first saw them.

01:05:30.496 --> 01:05:33.064
But being alive
is not the same as living.

01:05:33.891 --> 01:05:36.067
But if I die in here,

01:05:36.241 --> 01:05:37.721
then I really die?

01:05:45.424 --> 01:05:46.860
Quite the opposite.

01:05:47.035 --> 01:05:49.820
If you die here,
you become even more disoriented

01:05:49.994 --> 01:05:52.431
as you lash out
at everyone and everything.

01:05:53.824 --> 01:05:56.914
And, therefore,
you'’re stuck here even longer.

01:06:07.751 --> 01:06:10.101
Who are you, Virgil?

01:06:12.930 --> 01:06:16.542
I'’m just a guide trying to
get you where you want to be.

01:06:17.587 --> 01:06:19.067
And Dr. Lily?

01:06:20.590 --> 01:06:22.505
She'’s a guide too,

01:06:22.679 --> 01:06:25.812
albeit one
with a different purpose.

01:06:32.689 --> 01:06:34.908
Hey. Hey.

01:06:35.083 --> 01:06:36.910
I'’m gonna get you out of here.

01:06:38.738 --> 01:06:40.610
Let'’s try
to get you out of here.

01:06:40.784 --> 01:06:42.655
The other guy was drinking.

01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:45.832
Dead now.

01:06:46.007 --> 01:06:49.358
Don'’t listen to her.
Just look at me.

01:06:51.751 --> 01:06:53.014
Give me your hand.

01:06:56.539 --> 01:06:57.627
There you go.

01:07:02.849 --> 01:07:05.287
Anything
to look beautiful, right?

01:07:05.461 --> 01:07:07.419
You already look......beautiful.

01:07:07.593 --> 01:07:09.421
You hear that, Doc?

01:07:09.595 --> 01:07:11.423
He'’s gonna put you
out of business.

01:07:11.597 --> 01:07:14.296
Oh, I'’m going
to make you......even more beautiful.

01:07:14.470 --> 01:07:16.298
- Oh, you better.
- Are you ready?

01:07:16.472 --> 01:07:17.864
Mm-hmm.

01:07:18.039 --> 01:07:21.738
All right. Just relax
and look up into the light.

01:07:21.912 --> 01:07:23.957
He'’ll stop
flashing that in your face any moment now.

01:07:24.132 --> 01:07:26.743
The light is very annoying.

01:07:27.874 --> 01:07:29.441
That'’s a bit bright.

01:07:34.316 --> 01:07:37.797
Yeah, I know.
It'’s a bit of a stereotype, but I like '’em.

01:07:37.971 --> 01:07:40.061
Can I grab a coffee there,
as well?

01:07:53.509 --> 01:07:54.814
Hoodie.

01:07:59.515 --> 01:08:00.864
Don'’t move!

01:08:01.038 --> 01:08:03.084
Hands where I can see '’em!

01:08:03.258 --> 01:08:05.999
Put your hands behind your head.
Down on your knees.

01:08:06.174 --> 01:08:07.349
Not him.

01:08:08.437 --> 01:08:10.091
You got the wrong guy, man.

01:08:25.149 --> 01:08:26.672
He'’s getting away!

01:08:28.805 --> 01:08:30.372
It'’s not him.

01:08:37.292 --> 01:08:38.336
Are you okay?

01:08:47.737 --> 01:08:49.260
Let'’s get to the roof.

01:09:08.671 --> 01:09:09.976
That'’s not good.

01:09:11.282 --> 01:09:12.675
But I think I can take her.

01:09:14.111 --> 01:09:17.332
An injured
little girl in a hospital?

01:09:17.506 --> 01:09:19.334
She'’s a lot more
than that and you know it.

01:09:19.508 --> 01:09:21.858
Yeah, she is.

01:09:22.032 --> 01:09:24.077
Maybe you should try
talking to her.

01:09:24.252 --> 01:09:27.037
You know, the last time
you suggested that, it didn'’t work out so well.

01:09:27.211 --> 01:09:30.736
The last time I said that,
you were listening to someone else.

01:09:34.697 --> 01:09:36.699
She'’s all that
stands in our way?

01:09:37.613 --> 01:09:38.962
Exactly.

01:09:40.877 --> 01:09:42.052
Good.

01:09:56.109 --> 01:09:57.415
Hey there.

01:09:59.243 --> 01:10:00.679
Help me.

01:10:00.853 --> 01:10:02.072
I want to.

01:10:02.246 --> 01:10:04.205
I don'’t like it here.

01:10:04.379 --> 01:10:05.771
Me neither.

01:10:05.945 --> 01:10:07.382
Are you lost?

01:10:07.556 --> 01:10:10.472
Yes, but I don'’t want to go
with the bad lady.

01:10:10.646 --> 01:10:12.604
No.

01:10:12.778 --> 01:10:16.565
Sam is heading up to the roof
so we can call for help.

01:10:20.046 --> 01:10:21.787
Do you want to come with us?

01:10:23.702 --> 01:10:24.964
Come on.

01:10:27.358 --> 01:10:30.274
Well, I would suggest
the stairs, but...

01:10:33.495 --> 01:10:35.758
We'’re gonna take the elevator, okay?

01:10:38.369 --> 01:10:39.588
Good girl.

01:11:55.054 --> 01:11:57.274
Get her to the stairs. Now.

01:12:02.584 --> 01:12:05.238
Hey, baby.
Don'’t be scared.

01:12:05.413 --> 01:12:09.634
When I count to three,
I want you to run as fast as you can, okay?

01:12:11.375 --> 01:12:12.898
One,

01:12:13.072 --> 01:12:14.596
two,

01:12:14.770 --> 01:12:16.119
three! Run!

01:12:18.121 --> 01:12:19.862
- Go with her.
- What about you?

01:12:44.321 --> 01:12:46.497
You should be in bed.

01:12:57.552 --> 01:12:58.553
I love you.

01:12:59.641 --> 01:13:00.946
Don'’t get lost.

01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:13.089
Comatose. Brain-dead.
Life support.

01:13:13.263 --> 01:13:16.135
There is no up or down.

01:13:16.309 --> 01:13:18.616
You must stay in bed.

01:13:24.143 --> 01:13:25.318
Code red.

01:13:33.370 --> 01:13:34.763
Clear.

01:13:52.563 --> 01:13:54.043
I'’m the coma man.

01:14:06.751 --> 01:14:09.537
You should be in bed.

01:14:09.711 --> 01:14:11.321
Let him go!

01:14:14.106 --> 01:14:18.546
Ah, I thought we might need
to fix a sink.

01:14:21.462 --> 01:14:22.463
Virgil.

01:14:25.422 --> 01:14:27.293
How long have I been here?

01:14:27.468 --> 01:14:29.861
Oh, well,
that'’s up to you.

01:14:30.035 --> 01:14:31.994
The faceless ones
want you to stay.

01:14:33.256 --> 01:14:35.214
"Life at any cost."

01:14:36.999 --> 01:14:38.304
I have a choice?

01:14:38.479 --> 01:14:39.697
Always.

01:14:39.871 --> 01:14:42.004
Now make it,
and get out of here.

01:14:42.178 --> 01:14:44.485
What about you?

01:14:44.659 --> 01:14:47.966
Well, I still have
some more guiding to do.

01:14:51.492 --> 01:14:52.884
Carter?

01:14:53.058 --> 01:14:54.320
Among others.

01:14:55.670 --> 01:14:56.801
Good luck, Sam.

01:15:02.633 --> 01:15:04.026
Thank you, Virgil.

01:15:24.133 --> 01:15:25.656
Hey, mister.

01:15:27.528 --> 01:15:28.920
Please help me.

01:15:46.938 --> 01:15:48.157
Come with me.

01:15:48.331 --> 01:15:49.898
I can'’t do it.

01:15:50.072 --> 01:15:51.552
We can do this together.

01:15:52.857 --> 01:15:53.858
Come on.

01:16:00.648 --> 01:16:02.040
Go.

01:16:05.827 --> 01:16:08.003
Freedom from this place
is downstairs.

01:16:08.656 --> 01:16:09.657
I promise you.

01:16:10.309 --> 01:16:11.702
Lilith?

01:16:11.876 --> 01:16:15.967
Your wife, your work,
your future child

01:16:16.881 --> 01:16:18.361
have been taken from you.

01:16:19.841 --> 01:16:23.322
That fear you feel,
rage against it.

01:16:23.975 --> 01:16:25.498
Rage with me.

01:16:25.673 --> 01:16:27.109
Let go.

01:16:27.805 --> 01:16:28.893
Monica chose it.

01:16:43.342 --> 01:16:44.735
The cop chose it.

01:17:00.621 --> 01:17:02.535
And now you will choose it.

01:17:04.755 --> 01:17:06.452
I choose the roof.

01:17:06.627 --> 01:17:08.150
You shouldn'’t be with her!

01:17:32.391 --> 01:17:35.786
Come on.

01:17:44.665 --> 01:17:46.362
Come on. Let'’s go.

01:17:48.494 --> 01:17:49.539
Thank you.

01:18:17.436 --> 01:18:18.699
Let'’s go.

01:18:42.897 --> 01:18:44.725
We'’re going to be okay, baby.

01:18:49.207 --> 01:18:50.731
I love you.

01:19:31.684 --> 01:19:33.295
I love you, too.
