WEBVTT

00:00.166 --> 00:03.375
I gotta get goin'

00:03.375 --> 00:06.833
a friend of mine

00:08.500 --> 00:11.458
he's just Pooh Bear

00:14.125 --> 00:17.583
chasin' some honeybees

00:17.583 --> 00:21.000
I know he's out there

00:24.750 --> 00:28.208
we're so adventurous

00:28.208 --> 00:31.583
and again

00:31.583 --> 00:35.083
and there's nobody home

00:35.083 --> 00:38.500
to count on a friend

00:38.500 --> 00:42.083
Winnie the Pooh Bear

00:44.000 --> 00:45.583
take me, please?

00:45.583 --> 00:48.958
I gotta be there

00:50.875 --> 00:55.291
Winnie the Pooh

01:08.166 --> 01:11.833
Pooh:
My. It certainly
is impressive.

01:11.833 --> 01:13.875
And very well wrapped,
don't you think?

01:13.875 --> 01:16.250
At least it's not moving.

01:16.250 --> 01:18.250
That's a very good sign.

01:18.250 --> 01:20.708
Uh, this is
your package,
Gopher?

01:20.708 --> 01:24.416
You bet your stalactites,
you nincompoop.

01:24.416 --> 01:27.083
Ordered it from
Holes-R-Us.

01:27.083 --> 01:30.125
Gotta unwrap 'em
just so.

01:33.125 --> 01:35.625
Lucille.

01:45.375 --> 01:46.458
Hello, Gopher.

01:46.458 --> 01:48.291
How are you
and Lucille?

01:48.291 --> 01:50.750
Dandy.
Why, just look at how

01:50.750 --> 01:53.875
the sunlight shines
off her handle.

01:53.875 --> 01:58.458
Oh, and we got big plans.
Big plans.

01:58.458 --> 02:01.625
Oh, boy.
It'll be stupendous.

02:01.625 --> 02:05.333
Uh, Gopher,
I don't really know
about these things,

02:05.333 --> 02:07.625
but shouldn't you actually
do something with Lucille?

02:07.625 --> 02:09.833
Like, maybe dig?

02:11.375 --> 02:15.291
By gum, Piglet,
you're 600 percent right.

02:15.291 --> 02:17.458
I got completely
carried away.

02:25.166 --> 02:26.416
Ooh!

02:30.500 --> 02:34.708
Hi-ho, Lucille!

02:43.250 --> 02:45.708
What in the world?

02:49.166 --> 02:50.208
Uh-oh.

02:59.208 --> 03:03.000
So, Rabbit,
how do you like your
new carrot cellar?

03:03.000 --> 03:06.416
B-b-but I didn't ask for
a carrot cellar.

03:06.416 --> 03:09.500
It was Lucille's idea.

03:09.500 --> 03:12.000
Boy, do I love this shovel.

03:16.708 --> 03:18.958
A-ha!
Just as I suspected.

03:18.958 --> 03:21.208
One more smackerel.

03:32.208 --> 03:33.875
There ya are,
Pooh Bear.

03:33.875 --> 03:36.750
Just in time to see
me and Lucille

03:36.750 --> 03:40.125
build ya an Olympic size
swimmin' hole.

03:40.125 --> 03:42.250
Well, actually, Gopher,

03:42.250 --> 03:45.458
I don't feel
much like swimming
right at this moment.

03:45.458 --> 03:50.000
Eh, that's okay.
We'll build ya one
anyway.

03:56.875 --> 03:59.583
Ah, Lucille,
we've done it again.

03:59.583 --> 04:02.583
Course, you have to
fill it first.

04:02.583 --> 04:06.291
But those are just details.
Whaddaya think, Pooh?

04:06.291 --> 04:08.750
Pooh?

04:08.750 --> 04:12.000
Must have got impatient
and wandered off.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.291
Gopher.

04:18.416 --> 04:20.291
Hiya, Piglet.

04:20.291 --> 04:23.750
Just as soon as I'm done
renovating Tigger's house,

04:23.750 --> 04:26.000
I'll come help you out.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.750
That's nice.

04:27.750 --> 04:30.833
Uh, have you asked Tigger
if it's all right?

04:30.833 --> 04:34.291
Course it's all right.
He'll love it!

04:34.291 --> 04:36.083
Well, as long as
everybody's happy.

04:37.875 --> 04:41.625
Just look what Gopher
and that-that shovel
have done.

04:41.625 --> 04:44.625
But Rabbit,
Gopher's just excited.

04:44.625 --> 04:46.583
He's not really
hurting anybody.

04:46.583 --> 04:47.625
He's just digging.

04:50.458 --> 04:53.291
Oh, no.
Don't tell me it was--

04:53.291 --> 04:55.458
That underhanded,
underground,

04:55.458 --> 04:57.375
under everything menace.

04:57.375 --> 04:59.458
I knew it!

04:59.458 --> 05:01.333
What's he done now?

05:01.333 --> 05:03.375
I can't talk about it,
bunny boy.

05:03.375 --> 05:05.083
Too "humiloratin'".

05:05.083 --> 05:07.458
Now, wait.
I think we're being
a little hard on Gopher.

05:07.458 --> 05:09.708
He's just trying to help.

05:09.708 --> 05:11.250
If we just talk to him--

05:11.250 --> 05:12.708
Rabbit: No!

05:12.708 --> 05:15.458
His reign of digging
must be put to an end

05:15.458 --> 05:17.250
before he puts
an end to us.

05:20.875 --> 05:23.625
We're right behind ya,
captain fuzz face.

05:23.625 --> 05:25.166
Oh, dear.

05:27.708 --> 05:30.333
Gopher's just doing
what he's supposed to do
with a shovel.

05:30.333 --> 05:32.333
It's not that bad, really.

05:32.333 --> 05:34.500
And Lucille's
such a nice shovel.

05:34.500 --> 05:37.333
Can't understand why
everyone doesn't understand.

05:37.333 --> 05:39.500
Gopher's just
trying to be helpful.

05:45.708 --> 05:47.333
Oh, dear.

05:47.333 --> 05:51.125
Maybe this has gone
a little too far.

06:02.250 --> 06:04.875
Lucille.

06:06.375 --> 06:08.000
Lucille!

06:10.416 --> 06:12.250
Lucille.

06:14.708 --> 06:18.291
I do wish Lucille
weren't so very up.

06:34.875 --> 06:37.291
Oh, d-d-d-dear.

06:39.458 --> 06:42.166
Oh, no!

06:42.166 --> 06:44.958
Wha--!

06:44.958 --> 06:47.583
Someone stole Lucille!

06:49.583 --> 06:51.583
Oh, Gopher doesn't sound
very happy.

06:54.583 --> 06:55.875
What am I
going to do with you?

06:58.708 --> 07:00.958
I know.
I'll bury you.

07:00.958 --> 07:02.583
Then I'll talk to Gopher.

07:02.583 --> 07:06.166
Maybe if I explain,
he won't hurt me so hard.

07:12.875 --> 07:14.166
Help!

07:14.166 --> 07:16.083
Somebody help!

07:19.583 --> 07:21.583
Oh, deary dear.

07:23.416 --> 07:25.708
Is this a slumber party?

07:25.708 --> 07:28.458
No. Someone made off
with Lucille.

07:28.458 --> 07:32.958
We're gonna find
the nefarious wrongdoer now.

07:32.958 --> 07:35.625
What's the bear up to?

07:35.625 --> 07:38.958
Shh. I believe
I've found a clue.

07:40.750 --> 07:42.458
Tigger:
Obviously, the tracks of

07:42.458 --> 07:44.208
a yellow-bellied
shovel stealer.

07:45.833 --> 07:48.458
They seem to be
heading for Piglet's house.

07:50.458 --> 07:52.208
Piglet's gone.

07:52.208 --> 07:54.000
Yeah,
and so's his house.

07:54.000 --> 07:58.250
So, whatever got Lucille
got Piglet, too.

07:58.250 --> 08:02.625
This must be the work of
a yellow-bellied shovel
and Piglet stealer.

08:02.625 --> 08:04.583
Rawrrr.

08:04.583 --> 08:07.083
Shh.

08:07.083 --> 08:08.458
It may be down there.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.500
Rabbit: You go first.

08:11.500 --> 08:13.250
Tigger: Not me,
bunny boy.

08:15.708 --> 08:18.875
Rabbit? Tigger?
Help!

08:18.875 --> 08:21.083
Help!

08:21.083 --> 08:24.000
It's the yellow-bellied
shovel and Piglet stealer.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.583
Ah, don't be such
a fraidy bunny.

08:26.583 --> 08:28.583
We're gonna go down
and whack us

08:28.583 --> 08:30.708
a shovel nappin' varmint.

08:30.708 --> 08:32.875
Uh, down there?

08:32.875 --> 08:35.166
Oh, I don't think
we should do that.

08:35.166 --> 08:36.875
It's-- it's so far.

08:36.875 --> 08:39.416
It's not that far.

08:41.583 --> 08:42.875
See?

08:48.625 --> 08:50.500
- Piglet: Ouch!

08:50.500 --> 08:52.375
Uh, excuse me,

08:52.375 --> 08:55.125
but wasn't that a
Piglet sort of ouch,

08:55.125 --> 08:56.708
rather than
a yellow-bellied

08:56.708 --> 08:59.583
shovel and Piglet stealer
sort of ouch?

08:59.583 --> 09:01.208
Hey, Piglet!

09:01.208 --> 09:04.416
Seen any yellow-bellied
muckety mucks around?

09:04.416 --> 09:06.458
Piglet: You mean there's
one of those down here?

09:06.458 --> 09:09.250
Oh, dear.
I thought it was just
me and Lucille.

09:09.250 --> 09:11.583
Lucille!

09:11.583 --> 09:14.208
Hold on, baby,
I'm comin' for ya!

09:17.500 --> 09:19.458
Lucille.

09:19.458 --> 09:21.583
Never thought I'd
see ya again,

09:21.583 --> 09:24.833
my little lotus blossom.

09:24.833 --> 09:29.083
If that fiendish fiend
harmed a splinter
on your handle, I'll--

09:29.083 --> 09:30.750
Oh, my.

09:30.750 --> 09:33.875
Don't worry.
Just give me
one good shot

09:33.875 --> 09:36.083
at the crook
that kidnapped
you and Lucille,

09:36.083 --> 09:38.750
- and--
- But I took Lu--

09:38.750 --> 09:40.166
Cille.

09:40.166 --> 09:41.250
Oops.

09:41.250 --> 09:44.458
You took Lucille?

09:44.458 --> 09:46.458
But how could you
do that, Piglet?

09:46.458 --> 09:50.333
I didn't know any other way
to get you to stop digging.

09:50.333 --> 09:54.416
So what you're sayin' is
that I may have been diggin'

09:54.416 --> 09:57.000
where I didn't belong.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.958
Maybe a little.

10:01.208 --> 10:04.625
Mm. Don't worry.
I'll make it right
by everyone.

10:04.625 --> 10:08.000
I know you will.
But will you ever
forgive me?

10:08.000 --> 10:09.875
Of course.

10:09.875 --> 10:11.750
Will you ever forgive me?

10:11.750 --> 10:13.291
Of course.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.958
I guess this means
there's no yellow-bellied
whatever.

10:18.958 --> 10:21.500
No, I guess not.

10:21.500 --> 10:23.750
What are we gonna tell
the others?

10:23.750 --> 10:27.458
Well, there is one thing.

10:27.458 --> 10:30.000
It's been an
awfully long time.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.291
Perhaps we ought to
go down and help.

10:32.291 --> 10:35.000
No, no. Let's give them
a little while longer.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.291
Say, uh, a couple of days?

10:38.583 --> 10:40.625
Gopher: Take that,
you yellow-bellied

10:40.625 --> 10:42.958
shovel snatching thief!

10:42.958 --> 10:45.625
Piglet:
And here's some more
so you don't come back.

10:45.625 --> 10:47.458
-

10:54.291 --> 10:55.500
Pooh: Piglet.

10:55.500 --> 10:58.625
Are you two
"okedy-dokedy"?

10:58.625 --> 11:00.875
Hot diggity, we are.

11:00.875 --> 11:03.708
But it was a close shave.

11:03.708 --> 11:05.166
You know somethin'.

11:05.166 --> 11:07.375
After all this
excitement,

11:07.375 --> 11:09.875
I think Lucille
needs a rest.

11:09.875 --> 11:11.250
I'm gonna retire her.

11:11.250 --> 11:13.375
All: Hooray!

11:13.375 --> 11:16.500
But wait'll you see
what I ordered next.

11:16.500 --> 11:19.708
A steam shovel,
uh, spoon,

11:19.708 --> 11:21.500
a nuclear powered drill.

11:21.500 --> 11:23.458
I think I'll
name her Nancy.

11:27.958 --> 11:31.000
Mm. Prefer the name
Emily, huh?

11:41.208 --> 11:43.208
Piglet: Oh, dear.

11:43.208 --> 11:46.875
I know I've
forgotten something.

11:46.875 --> 11:50.416
Since very small animals
have very short memories,

11:50.416 --> 11:52.875
I must have forgotten
to remember something.

11:53.958 --> 11:55.500
Water the rhododendron?

11:55.500 --> 11:56.583
No.

11:56.583 --> 11:58.125
Shine the woodwork?

11:58.125 --> 11:59.208
No.

11:59.208 --> 12:01.125
Wax the floor?

12:01.125 --> 12:02.875
Noooo!

12:04.708 --> 12:07.416
Oh, dear.
Since I've remembered
everything else,

12:07.416 --> 12:09.583
there's only one thing
I could have forgotten.

12:09.583 --> 12:12.083
Why, it must be
Pooh's birthday.

12:12.083 --> 12:14.333
Oh, dear.

12:14.333 --> 12:17.458
Hm. If these tomatoes
were any smaller,

12:17.458 --> 12:19.708
or any greener,
they'd be olives.

12:19.708 --> 12:21.625
Something is most
definitely wrong.

12:21.625 --> 12:23.333
Oof!

12:23.333 --> 12:27.416
Perhaps Rabbit can help me
plan Pooh's birthday.

12:27.416 --> 12:29.416
Hiya, Piglet old pal.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.583
What brings you to
this neck of the woods?

12:31.583 --> 12:35.458
Well, actually,
I remembered something
very, very important,

12:35.458 --> 12:36.583
and I need your help.

12:36.583 --> 12:38.750
What is it, Piglet?

12:38.750 --> 12:40.291
Well, you see,
today--

12:40.291 --> 12:42.166
by which I mean
this day--

12:42.166 --> 12:43.708
is Pooh's birthday.

12:43.708 --> 12:45.833
Oh, my, Piglet,
you're right.

12:45.833 --> 12:47.166
Today must be the day.

12:47.166 --> 12:49.000
'Cause it wasn't yesterday.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
And tomorrow's the day
I rearrange my sock drawer.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.750
This is extraordinary.

12:53.750 --> 12:56.750
We have to
organize a party
immediately.

12:56.750 --> 12:58.458
And a birthday cake.

12:58.458 --> 13:00.125
Maybe a few balloons?

13:00.125 --> 13:01.875
And a birthday cake.

13:01.875 --> 13:03.708
And perhaps some games?

13:03.708 --> 13:06.208
- And a--
- Yes, Tigger,
a birthday cake.

13:06.208 --> 13:09.750
Oh, dear.
But I don't have any candles.

13:09.750 --> 13:11.833
Why, a cake
without candles,

13:11.833 --> 13:14.625
it's positively
"un-birthdayicle".

13:14.625 --> 13:18.166
In that case,
we'll just go out
and find some candles.

13:18.166 --> 13:21.000
On his birthday,
nothing is too good
for our Pooh.

13:22.458 --> 13:25.000
Rabbit: My, my, my,
Pooh's birthday.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.416
Good thing I have
these emergency candles.

13:29.583 --> 13:32.291
Better take a few more
just to be on the safe side.

13:33.458 --> 13:35.708
Fortunately,
for a very small animal,

13:35.708 --> 13:38.250
I have a very large
fear of the dark.

13:38.250 --> 13:40.166
Perhaps I'd better take
a few more,

13:40.166 --> 13:42.166
just to be on the safe side.

13:45.166 --> 13:46.500
Can't have a party
without candles.

13:46.500 --> 13:47.833
Hoo-hoo.

13:47.833 --> 13:50.833
Better take a few more
just to--

13:50.833 --> 13:52.875
Well, there's gotta be
some reason.

13:56.000 --> 13:59.708
There. One birthday cake
for our birthday Pooh.

13:59.708 --> 14:03.166
Hoo! I knew buddy bear
was havin' a birthday,

14:03.166 --> 14:05.375
I just didn't know
he was havin' so many.

14:05.375 --> 14:07.583
Why,
with all these candles,

14:07.583 --> 14:09.000
it appears that
our friend Pooh

14:09.000 --> 14:11.583
is much older
than we thought.

14:11.583 --> 14:14.958
The last time I saw a cake
with this many candles on it

14:14.958 --> 14:17.375
was at Christopher Robin's
birthday.

14:17.375 --> 14:19.833
Yeah.
And Christopher Robin
was the only one

14:19.833 --> 14:22.000
smart enough
to count 'em all.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.750
Say, if buddy bear
is that much older
than we thought,

14:25.750 --> 14:28.458
he must be
that much smarter, too.

14:28.458 --> 14:32.208
Now, now, Tigger,
we mustn't jump to
conclusions.

14:32.208 --> 14:33.708
So, let's jump over
to Pooh's,

14:33.708 --> 14:35.875
and let him know
what a genius he is.
Hoo-hoo!

14:35.875 --> 14:39.291
Won't Pooh be surprised when
he finds out how old he is.

14:39.291 --> 14:41.083
He'll be even more
surprised

14:41.083 --> 14:43.583
when he finds out
how smart he is.

14:47.458 --> 14:49.000
All: Surprise!

14:49.000 --> 14:51.708
My, this is
a surprise.

14:51.708 --> 14:53.166
We brought you this cake

14:53.166 --> 14:55.333
because I remembered
that I think I forgot

14:55.333 --> 14:57.375
that today is your birthday.

14:59.708 --> 15:03.000
Oh, why, just look at
all those candles, Pooh.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.250
Yeah. And you're older
than we thought.

15:05.250 --> 15:08.250
And so much smarter, too?

15:08.250 --> 15:11.583
Uh, since I didn't know
I was so old,

15:11.583 --> 15:13.875
I supposed I wouldn't know
I was so smart, either.

15:13.875 --> 15:15.583
I think.

15:15.583 --> 15:20.291
Uh, perhaps
we can discuss this
over a smackerel of cake.

15:20.291 --> 15:22.708
Pooh Bear,
you've certainly kept your

15:22.708 --> 15:25.166
extraordinary intelligence
a secret.

15:25.166 --> 15:28.458
Yes, Rabbit.
Even I didn't know about it.

15:28.458 --> 15:32.333
Perhaps you could help me with
a little gardening question.

15:32.333 --> 15:33.708
Should I plant my tomatoes

15:33.708 --> 15:36.083
next to the parsnips
or the artichokes?

15:36.083 --> 15:41.083
Well, that would depend on
how the tomatoes feel about it.

15:41.083 --> 15:42.708
Don't you think, Rabbit?

15:42.708 --> 15:45.708
Why, yes, Pooh,
I suppose that it would.

15:45.708 --> 15:48.500
Confidentially speaking,
Pooh boy,

15:48.500 --> 15:51.208
what's the best way for me
to cover more ground

15:51.208 --> 15:53.166
with my bouncing?

15:53.166 --> 15:56.833
Well, I should think that
to cover more ground,

15:56.833 --> 15:58.166
when you bounce up,

15:58.166 --> 16:00.458
just don't come back down.

16:00.458 --> 16:03.375
Whaddaya know?

16:03.375 --> 16:06.000
Old buddy bear
really is a genius.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.750
Pooh, I don't want to bother
someone as smart as you,

16:08.750 --> 16:11.375
but how long should I take
with my spring cleaning?

16:11.375 --> 16:13.875
Why, it would take you
a very long time

16:13.875 --> 16:16.000
to clean all of spring,
Piglet.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.583
There's an awful lot of it
outside today.

16:18.583 --> 16:21.333
Clean all of the spring?

16:21.333 --> 16:22.750
Oh, dear.

16:22.750 --> 16:24.708
Pooh Bear,
thank you.

16:24.708 --> 16:27.375
I can hardly wait
to tackle that garden now.

16:27.375 --> 16:30.625
Hoo!
And just wait'll you see
the ground I cover.

16:30.625 --> 16:33.458
I guess I'd better
get started right away.

16:33.458 --> 16:36.375
I'm so glad
that you're glad.

16:36.375 --> 16:37.625
And now for some cake.

16:40.333 --> 16:43.000
Perhaps I should save
the candles for later,

16:43.000 --> 16:45.375
just to be on
the safe side.

16:45.375 --> 16:46.708
According to Pooh,

16:46.708 --> 16:49.250
if I want to know where
to plant my tomatoes,

16:49.250 --> 16:52.416
it would depend on
how they feel about it.

16:52.416 --> 16:56.000
And the only way
I can know how
a tomato feels,

16:56.000 --> 16:58.208
is to feel like a tomato.

17:02.083 --> 17:03.416
Ya-hoo-hoo!

17:07.125 --> 17:10.875
Oh, Piglet,
so good to see you.

17:10.875 --> 17:12.500
And you, too, Owl.

17:12.500 --> 17:14.875
You seem to be
very busy, Piglet.

17:14.875 --> 17:16.291
Thanks to Pooh,

17:16.291 --> 17:18.375
I'm busy with
my spring cleaning.

17:18.375 --> 17:20.250
But doesn't
spring cleaning

17:20.250 --> 17:23.375
usually occur
inside one's home?

17:23.375 --> 17:25.208
Not according to Pooh.

17:25.208 --> 17:29.083
He is now a bear with
a very large brain, Owl.

17:29.083 --> 17:31.250
Uh, you mean our Pooh?

17:32.458 --> 17:33.875
Please excuse me, Owl,

17:33.875 --> 17:36.833
but so much spring keeps
falling off the trees.

17:36.833 --> 17:38.625
Goodbye.

17:38.625 --> 17:40.958
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Look out below!

17:43.583 --> 17:46.166
Hiya, Owl.
Just thought I'd drop by.

17:46.166 --> 17:50.208
Tigger,
I've just heard the most
extraordinary news.

17:50.208 --> 17:52.291
Pooh is a very smart bear.

17:52.291 --> 17:56.000
Yeah, and it was
a good thing I was there
to tell him about it.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.958
Sorry, Owl.
Can't hang around here
all day, you know.

17:58.958 --> 18:02.458
This stayin' up stuff
is trickier than it looks.

18:02.458 --> 18:04.583
Ya-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

18:09.583 --> 18:12.250
So Pooh is
a very smart bear?

18:12.250 --> 18:14.000
Rabbit:
The smartest, Owl.

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
My word.
Who said that?

18:17.000 --> 18:19.125
I did.

18:19.125 --> 18:21.125
Talking tomatoes?

18:21.125 --> 18:22.625
No, no, it's me,
Rabbit.

18:22.625 --> 18:24.458
I only look like
a tomato.

18:24.458 --> 18:26.583
And it's because of Pooh.

18:26.583 --> 18:28.625
He's smarter
than we realized.

18:28.625 --> 18:29.958
- Did you hear that?

18:29.958 --> 18:31.125
It sounded like
a tomato.

18:32.583 --> 18:35.958
Don't start talking
until I get there.

18:35.958 --> 18:38.875
Well, well,
how delightful.

18:38.875 --> 18:42.833
Now I can converse with Pooh
on a higher plane.

18:42.833 --> 18:47.166
However, one cannot
assume intelligence
too lightly.

18:47.166 --> 18:48.833
Perhaps a few tests of

18:48.833 --> 18:50.750
our new smarter friend Pooh
are in order.

18:52.375 --> 18:54.375
Pooh: Are you certain you
wouldn't care for

18:54.375 --> 18:59.208
just one more taste of
my "what a surprise"
birthday cake, Owl?

18:59.208 --> 19:01.458
Why, thank you,
Pooh Bear.

19:01.458 --> 19:03.708
But first,
if you don't mind,

19:03.708 --> 19:07.291
I have a few questions
I'd like to ask you.

19:07.291 --> 19:11.583
If I have five pots of honey,
and I take away three pots,

19:11.583 --> 19:14.208
how many pots of honey
do I have left?

19:17.250 --> 19:20.250
Not enough for dinner,
I'm afraid.

19:20.250 --> 19:25.083
Hmm. Perhaps Pooh is smarter
than I first suspected.

19:26.583 --> 19:29.208
Surely one of these tomatoes
will talk to me.

19:30.708 --> 19:33.375
I've always been known
as a good listener.

19:33.375 --> 19:35.083
So who would like
to start?

19:35.083 --> 19:36.708
A place for everything,

19:36.708 --> 19:39.250
and everything in its place.

19:39.250 --> 19:43.083
Oh, my.
This is most certainly
in the wrong place.

19:44.583 --> 19:46.625
I heard that.
Which one of you was it?

19:48.625 --> 19:50.000
Piglet.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.583
What are you doing
with that tomato?

19:51.583 --> 19:53.958
Look out below!

19:56.750 --> 19:59.708
Not a bad landing space.
Thanks, Rabbit.

19:59.708 --> 20:01.208
That does it!

20:01.208 --> 20:03.208
It's high time we spoke
with Pooh Bear

20:03.208 --> 20:05.250
about his
very smart advice,

20:05.250 --> 20:07.875
which may not have been
so very smart after all.

20:07.875 --> 20:09.875
You're right,
long ears.

20:09.875 --> 20:11.708
Too bad we didn't
think about doing that

20:11.708 --> 20:14.125
before we followed
Pooh's advice.

20:15.708 --> 20:16.708
Pull!

20:20.125 --> 20:22.458
If I'd known
you were coming,
Rabbit,

20:22.458 --> 20:24.250
I'd have built
a bigger door.

20:27.083 --> 20:29.458
Pooh, I must have
a word with you

20:29.458 --> 20:31.833
about your
very smart advice.

20:31.833 --> 20:34.333
And what word
would that be, Rabbit?

20:34.333 --> 20:35.833
Just one.

20:35.833 --> 20:37.458
It didn't work!

20:37.458 --> 20:40.250
Pooh, Rabbit is
a little concerned

20:40.250 --> 20:42.750
that the very smart
advice you gave

20:42.750 --> 20:45.083
may not have been
so very smart after all.

20:45.083 --> 20:47.583
Yeah. And if you're
not smart,

20:47.583 --> 20:50.875
what were all those candles
doing on your birthday cake?

20:50.875 --> 20:53.125
Oh, yes.
That reminds me.

20:53.125 --> 20:55.291
My birthday cake.

20:55.291 --> 20:58.625
There's still
plenty to share.

20:58.625 --> 21:00.125
The candles.

21:00.125 --> 21:01.166
Why, there's only one.

21:01.166 --> 21:03.416
Gasp! I'm seeing single.

21:03.416 --> 21:05.416
What happened to the rest of
your "birthyday" cake?

21:05.416 --> 21:06.833
And all the candles?

21:08.708 --> 21:11.291
Oh, yes.
I remember.

21:11.291 --> 21:13.708
Owl was asking me
so many questions

21:13.708 --> 21:16.291
that I worked up
a very large appetite.

21:16.291 --> 21:20.750
So I carefully placed
all the candles
in this honey jar.

21:20.750 --> 21:22.458
For safe keeping.

21:22.458 --> 21:25.291
Why, buddy bear,
do you know what
this means?

21:26.625 --> 21:28.000
No.

21:28.000 --> 21:31.833
It means that jar
is very, very old.

21:31.833 --> 21:33.583
Why, it's "antiquifried."

21:33.583 --> 21:35.458
Why, thank you, Tigger.

21:35.458 --> 21:37.458
What a perfect
birthday gift.

21:37.458 --> 21:40.875
An "antiquifried"
honey jar?

21:40.875 --> 21:44.958
Does this mean that
Pooh is not so very smart
after all?

21:44.958 --> 21:48.125
It is my opinion that
our friend Pooh Bear

21:48.125 --> 21:51.083
is the Poohiest bear
I have ever known.

21:51.083 --> 21:52.833
Oh, good.

21:52.833 --> 21:54.416
Now that
that's settled,

21:54.416 --> 21:57.375
let's all enjoy
this birthday slice.

21:57.375 --> 21:59.125
Yeah, Pooh boy.

21:59.125 --> 22:02.375
Now that's a terrifically
smart idea.

22:02.375 --> 22:04.333
Piglet:
And friendly, too.
