WEBVTT

00:09.600 --> 00:13.120
-Can't you go any faster?
-I'm sorry, I'm doing my best, sir.

00:23.280 --> 00:24.920
Family of Lidia Aguilar?

00:25.000 --> 00:27.080
Yes, that's me. Is she all right?

00:27.160 --> 00:30.400
Yes. The doctor's examining
the patient right now and...

00:30.480 --> 00:33.360
when we have the diagnosis,
we'll tell you more.

00:33.440 --> 00:36.720
-But she's conscious? She's woken up?
-She's awake. She's fine.

00:36.800 --> 00:38.240
What's wrong with her?

00:38.520 --> 00:41.440
We can't say anything else right now.
You have to wait.

00:44.480 --> 00:45.400
Thank you.

00:49.160 --> 00:53.360
A long time ago, I learned that
some things are better kept to yourself.

00:55.600 --> 00:58.640
Whatever the cost, whatever it is.

01:01.400 --> 01:03.800
Because if those secrets come to light,

01:04.400 --> 01:06.440
they may change your life completely.

01:09.400 --> 01:12.240
Miss Aguilar,
I'm glad to see you looking so well.

01:13.520 --> 01:14.920
What's wrong with me?

01:16.080 --> 01:17.720
You're expecting a child.

01:21.040 --> 01:24.240
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

02:20.080 --> 02:23.680
-Are you all right, ma'am?
-Yes.

02:24.280 --> 02:27.080
Yes, it's just not what I expected.

02:27.920 --> 02:30.680
Sometimes it's better for things
to happen unexpectedly.

02:31.200 --> 02:32.040
Sure.

02:32.120 --> 02:34.840
I'll give you all the details
when your husband comes.

02:34.920 --> 02:37.320
-I'll call a nurse to get him.
-My husband? What?

02:37.400 --> 02:40.200
The man in the waiting room.
I thought he was your husband.

02:40.280 --> 02:43.600
Yes. Excuse me, I'm a little...

02:44.200 --> 02:45.760
disoriented by all this.

02:45.840 --> 02:47.880
Naturally. Let's call him.

02:47.960 --> 02:50.800
No. I mean...

02:51.640 --> 02:53.680
We've been waiting for a long time and...

02:55.080 --> 02:59.200
I'd like to give him the good news
in private, if you don't mind.

02:59.280 --> 03:00.480
He'll be very happy.

03:00.560 --> 03:03.600
I understand why,
if it's your first child.

03:03.680 --> 03:07.360
-So, is that it? Can I go?
-On my end, it's all in order.

03:07.440 --> 03:09.040
Make a follow-up appointment.

03:09.120 --> 03:10.120
CHAPTER 13: SECRETS

03:10.200 --> 03:13.000
-Great. Thank you.
-Enjoy the news.

03:13.080 --> 03:15.720
Yes... Thank you.

03:32.600 --> 03:34.600
Lidia, are you all right?

03:35.440 --> 03:36.800
What did they say?

03:38.120 --> 03:40.320
-Leave me alone. I want to go home.
-Listen...

03:40.400 --> 03:41.760
Leave me alone!

03:43.120 --> 03:44.080
Go.

04:01.760 --> 04:03.880
You must have had a good reason

04:03.960 --> 04:06.920
to slug it out with Carlos
in front of my brother.

04:07.880 --> 04:09.480
I hope it was worth it.

04:10.800 --> 04:12.080
It's about her, isn't it?

04:13.440 --> 04:15.160
-About Lidia?
-Why do you say that?

04:15.240 --> 04:18.279
Something tells me she's the one
who broke Carlos' heart.

04:18.880 --> 04:22.440
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-The way he looks at her

04:22.520 --> 04:25.200
and how he dragged her
out of the building.

04:25.280 --> 04:27.000
After we fought?

04:28.080 --> 04:29.640
I knew I wasn't wrong.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.200
I'd better go.

04:36.800 --> 04:41.640
I'm sorry I put you on the spot
on the rooftop.

04:43.720 --> 04:48.200
This really is a tough time for me.

04:49.480 --> 04:51.880
I don't know what happened.
I lost control.

04:51.960 --> 04:55.560
For a moment,
I thought about ending my life.

04:57.160 --> 04:59.680
-I'm so sorry if I pressured you.
-No.

05:00.440 --> 05:03.240
No, no, don't blame yourself.
It's not your fault.

05:04.080 --> 05:07.640
I don't think anyone reaches that point
just by feeling pressured.

05:11.560 --> 05:13.000
Are you all right?

05:14.560 --> 05:16.720
I lost a witness that way once.

05:18.360 --> 05:19.520
A long time ago now.

05:21.440 --> 05:23.320
You accused an innocent person?

05:24.240 --> 05:26.200
It's hard to get over something like that.

05:30.240 --> 05:32.040
How long ago was it?

05:37.320 --> 05:40.160
You don't have to tell me
if you don't want to.

05:43.600 --> 05:46.800
I thought it'd be good to talk.
It helps me.

05:56.200 --> 05:59.200
I'm sorry if I made you feel bad.

06:00.520 --> 06:03.320
I'm finding it hard
to deal with this on my own.

06:05.760 --> 06:09.520
And you, on the rooftop,

06:11.040 --> 06:14.400
proved to me that not all men
are like the one who left me.

06:15.280 --> 06:19.320
If he left you, he's not a man,
he's a bastard who doesn't deserve you.

06:22.320 --> 06:24.760
Forgive me, I shouldn't have said that.

06:24.840 --> 06:28.200
-I should go.
-No, no. Please.

06:30.760 --> 06:33.080
You've always treated me so well...

06:34.920 --> 06:37.120
Ángeles, I don't know if we should...

06:39.400 --> 06:42.840
Please, don't leave me alone.

07:45.480 --> 07:48.840
Sara! Sara, we won! We did it!

07:48.920 --> 07:51.080
We did away with the rules.

07:51.920 --> 07:54.480
And it doesn't stop there.
You're coming back tomorrow.

07:54.560 --> 07:58.240
But as an operator,
so you can't give me orders.

07:58.880 --> 08:00.840
Aren't you happy? Do you like the idea?

08:00.920 --> 08:05.000
No, no, it's not that.
I'm so happy for you and the girls.

08:09.040 --> 08:11.280
-I'm not going back, Carlota.
-What?

08:14.040 --> 08:16.240
But, Sara, we won. We did it together.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.960
And you needn't worry about anything.

08:20.600 --> 08:24.680
What is it?
You know you can tell me anything.

08:26.680 --> 08:30.120
There's a doctor, Dr. Longoria.
He treats cases like mine.

08:30.200 --> 08:31.240
What cases?

08:33.600 --> 08:36.640
Carlota, I just want to know
what's wrong with me.

08:36.720 --> 08:39.680
I need to know who I really am.
Don't you understand?

08:40.159 --> 08:41.320
Of course I understand.

08:41.400 --> 08:45.480
I'll help and support you, but
I don't know what this doctor will say.

08:45.880 --> 08:47.360
Neither do I...

08:47.960 --> 08:50.080
but he's a doctor with a good reputation.

08:50.160 --> 08:53.240
-I've been looking up information...
-Doctors cure illnesses,

08:53.320 --> 08:55.480
and you're not sick. You're not.

08:55.560 --> 08:58.880
If you really want to support me,
support me with this.

08:59.680 --> 09:01.280
I want this doctor to see me.

09:01.560 --> 09:05.240
Girls, I'm home. Did I miss something?

09:05.320 --> 09:08.320
-Why are you smoking that crap?
-What were you talking about?

09:08.560 --> 09:12.200
About the strike,
how we're going to celebrate it and--

09:12.280 --> 09:13.960
-Carlota.
-What?

09:14.040 --> 09:15.680
No more lies.

09:18.400 --> 09:21.560
-What lies?
-Miguel, I have to tell you something.

09:24.960 --> 09:28.080
He asked me in front of everyone,
in the middle of the strike.

09:28.160 --> 09:31.000
What's that about a strike?
María Inmaculada?

09:32.640 --> 09:35.760
No, no, no. The Stork, The Stork.
It's a...

09:36.600 --> 09:40.240
café near where we work.

09:40.320 --> 09:42.080
-Yes.
-Well, there.

09:42.160 --> 09:45.080
Oh, good. I'm glad.

09:45.720 --> 09:51.720
May God bless this union,
with a marriage, then with a baby.

09:51.800 --> 09:54.640
Grandma, not so fast.
There'll be time for everything.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.760
A marriage without children
is like a stove without coal.

09:58.840 --> 10:00.640
It has no reason to exist.

10:00.720 --> 10:04.960
Just last night I got
Pablito's engagement ring back.

10:05.040 --> 10:06.840
Nothing like a good herb liqueur.

10:06.920 --> 10:10.160
-Shall I send it to you?
-No, no, no!

10:10.240 --> 10:11.720
This one's beautiful.

10:11.800 --> 10:14.560
Sure, don't worry. You keep it.

10:14.640 --> 10:17.320
Well, then... as you wish.

10:18.280 --> 10:20.800
And congratulations to you both.

10:22.200 --> 10:24.960
-You're making me very happy.
-Thanks, Grandma.

10:25.040 --> 10:27.600
Take care. I want you looking radiant
for the wedding.

10:28.560 --> 10:29.880
Right. Bye!

10:39.920 --> 10:40.880
A little modesty.

10:40.960 --> 10:43.440
God is everywhere
and we don't want to offend him.

10:43.520 --> 10:45.680
Doña Lola, we're engaged.

10:45.760 --> 10:48.440
God has more important things
to think about.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.640
Maybe God does, but I don't.

10:50.720 --> 10:53.600
In this house, appetizers aren't served
before blessing the meal.

10:53.680 --> 10:56.520
-Agreed?
-Agreed, Doña Lola.

10:57.360 --> 10:58.960
That's more like it, son.

11:00.760 --> 11:05.280
If you keep agreeing with her, she'll stop
letting us sit together at dinner.

11:05.360 --> 11:07.160
She lets me in without objecting.

11:07.240 --> 11:10.920
Without objecting, Pablo?
You're my fiancé and...

11:11.000 --> 11:13.120
-we love each other.
-Yes.

11:13.200 --> 11:14.560
What more do we need?

11:15.640 --> 11:17.000
For what?

11:18.480 --> 11:20.920
Sweetie, when you look at me like that...

11:21.000 --> 11:22.800
I should know what you're thinking.

11:22.880 --> 11:25.680
I'm thinking of us,
of how much we love each other,

11:25.760 --> 11:27.760
and the time we've been together.

11:28.240 --> 11:31.480
Since I arrived in Madrid,
I've changed a lot.

11:32.400 --> 11:36.480
I'm a more confident woman now,
with clearer, more modern ideas.

11:37.120 --> 11:41.320
I realize that my small-town ideas
are old-fashioned.

11:42.960 --> 11:46.560
I know you're trying
to tell me something, but...

11:46.640 --> 11:49.000
Sometimes respecting
certain traditions is absurd.

11:49.080 --> 11:50.440
-Right
-Right?

11:50.520 --> 11:54.520
Because if two people love each other,
it's not worth waiting for...

11:55.800 --> 11:59.280
Pablo, I'm finding it harder
and harder to restrain myself.

11:59.960 --> 12:02.400
It's hard to restrain yourself?

12:02.480 --> 12:06.680
You know, that heat,
that thing I feel when we're together...

12:08.080 --> 12:10.640
-Doesn't it happen to you?
-No, no, no... Yes, yes!

12:10.720 --> 12:14.600
It does happen to me,
but there's no rush, right?

12:14.680 --> 12:16.800
We have all the time in the world.

12:16.880 --> 12:19.480
No need to take the bread
out of the oven too soon.

12:19.560 --> 12:20.840
What are you talking about?

12:21.680 --> 12:23.520
I'm hungry. Let's go to dinner.

12:23.600 --> 12:26.440
-That calamari sandwich place.
-And Doña Lola was worried.

12:27.040 --> 12:30.760
Fine, but you're buying.
I'll see if Lidia wants to come.

12:30.840 --> 12:33.520
And we can give her
the good news together. Okay?

12:34.200 --> 12:35.600
Whatever my future wife says.

12:36.120 --> 12:37.000
Sweet talker.

12:40.960 --> 12:43.280
Lidia! Lidia?

12:43.360 --> 12:47.400
Oh, darn.
I guess it's just going to be us two.

12:47.480 --> 12:50.920
PABLO SANTOS - WEDNESDAY
PHIMOSIS

12:51.560 --> 12:53.200
Six days.

12:53.800 --> 12:56.960
Six days is 144 hours.
Hold on, Pablo, hold on.

13:00.080 --> 13:01.600
Where is she?

13:02.720 --> 13:04.800
If you're looking for Lidia,
you've come in vain.

13:04.880 --> 13:08.120
People saw you arguing after the strike.
What happened?

13:08.200 --> 13:10.680
And don't lie.
They saw you leave together.

13:10.760 --> 13:14.080
Yes, we were outside
and she suddenly felt dizzy and fainted.

13:16.720 --> 13:19.400
-She fainted?
-I took her to hospital,

13:19.960 --> 13:22.280
but she left on her own.
She said she was fine.

13:22.360 --> 13:24.560
She had some reaction to a medicine--

13:24.640 --> 13:27.240
-What the hell are you saying?
-I'm saying

13:27.320 --> 13:30.800
I tried to find out what happened,
but she refused to talk to me.

13:31.360 --> 13:32.880
Why were you arguing?

13:33.000 --> 13:36.080
What did you say to make her faint?

13:36.160 --> 13:40.360
Francisco, I didn't do anything, I swear.
I'm just as worried as you.

13:40.440 --> 13:43.360
If something happened to her
and you're not telling me...

13:43.440 --> 13:47.160
-What will we do? Fight? Again?
-No, no.

13:47.240 --> 13:49.400
If anything bad happened to her,
I'll kill you.

14:05.560 --> 14:08.160
Six months is too long
to go without see each other,

14:08.240 --> 14:09.480
don't you think, princess?

14:10.400 --> 14:13.120
Thanks for responding to my call
so quickly.

14:14.360 --> 14:15.840
How are you, Alba?

14:17.720 --> 14:20.760
-Alba died a long time ago.
-Well...

14:21.560 --> 14:25.720
I'm so glad you still count on me
when things turn ugly.

14:25.800 --> 14:27.480
What is it this time?

14:28.720 --> 14:31.400
I need you to get me
a widow's certificate.

14:33.040 --> 14:35.440
And this widow's certificate is for?

14:35.520 --> 14:37.320
-It's for me.
-What?

14:40.200 --> 14:41.640
I'm pregnant.

14:41.720 --> 14:44.440
-Do you know who the father is?
-That doesn't matter.

14:46.120 --> 14:47.840
I'll bring up my child myself.

14:47.920 --> 14:51.240
I don't need a man beside me
to make my way.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.360
-Honey, what about having an--
-No.

14:54.440 --> 14:55.760
No.

15:00.840 --> 15:03.160
I'll bring it up alone.

15:03.840 --> 15:05.560
That's why I need your help.

15:07.040 --> 15:09.240
You know better than anyone that...

15:09.320 --> 15:12.280
the world will judge me
harshly unless I become...

15:14.360 --> 15:16.200
a poor widow.

15:18.400 --> 15:19.800
All right.

15:20.360 --> 15:23.840
-But give me a few days, eh?
-I need it as soon as possible.

15:23.920 --> 15:27.520
I thought the document
was for your friend Ángeles.

15:30.320 --> 15:31.960
Why do you say that?

15:32.040 --> 15:34.240
I think she's got trouble, too.

15:34.320 --> 15:38.240
She asked me to get some information
on a policeman called Cuevas.

15:39.040 --> 15:40.880
What did she tell you, exactly?

15:41.640 --> 15:44.240
You'll have to ask her that.

15:44.320 --> 15:46.800
She asked me to be discreet,
and you know me.

15:46.880 --> 15:49.200
Victoria, what did Ángeles tell you?

15:57.960 --> 16:01.120
"Witness states he saw
a dark-haired woman dump the car."

16:01.680 --> 16:02.680
Ángeles.

16:06.200 --> 16:08.920
-It's late, I have to go.
-Already?

16:09.920 --> 16:12.120
-Don't you want to sleep here?
-No, impossible.

16:12.200 --> 16:14.120
I have a lot of work at the station.

16:14.200 --> 16:16.800
This shouldn't have happened,
and it won't happen again.

16:21.160 --> 16:23.240
-I don't usually do this.
-No.

16:23.320 --> 16:25.800
It's the first time
that I've ever done this.

16:25.880 --> 16:29.440
No, I didn't mean that.
It's just that the case is open.

16:31.120 --> 16:33.480
Ángeles, you're an extraordinary woman...

16:34.640 --> 16:38.120
but I can't right now. I'm sorry.

17:14.040 --> 17:15.480
What are you doing here?

17:15.560 --> 17:18.280
You want me to explain out here?
Can I come in?

17:21.120 --> 17:22.040
Why are you here?

17:23.760 --> 17:27.880
-Mario's in Madrid. He never left.
-What? What are you talking about?

17:28.560 --> 17:32.800
I found this at home today. I remembered
that Mario said you gave it to him.

17:32.880 --> 17:35.880
Great. Now you have a souvenir
of when you two betrayed me.

17:36.280 --> 17:38.320
I don't think you get it, Ángeles.

17:38.600 --> 17:42.080
Mario had keys to my place.
I assure you, this wasn't there before.

17:42.440 --> 17:44.480
What if he's in the city
and went to my place?

17:45.680 --> 17:48.120
I think you're losing your mind.

17:48.680 --> 17:49.840
Mario isn't here.

17:49.920 --> 17:53.560
-How come you're so sure?
-Because Mario ran off.

17:54.800 --> 17:56.280
There's proof he left with another woman.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.160
For a moment,
I thought he'd gone with you...

18:00.280 --> 18:03.760
but clearly,
he didn't love you that much either.

18:07.240 --> 18:10.240
Mario cheated on both of us.
I feel just as betrayed as you.

18:10.320 --> 18:14.160
Fine. Where are you going with all this?

18:14.240 --> 18:15.360
I'm not your enemy.

18:18.360 --> 18:19.880
We're on the same side.

18:21.520 --> 18:23.560
Sure. Now you want us to be friends?

18:23.640 --> 18:26.600
No, I don't want to be your friend,
I just want...

18:27.040 --> 18:29.640
-to bury the hatchet.
-This isn't a war.

18:29.720 --> 18:32.920
For starters,
because I have no interest in it at all.

18:33.000 --> 18:36.400
Mario disappeared. I just want to know
where my husband is.

18:37.440 --> 18:40.040
-If you don't mind...
-Sure, don't worry.

18:41.720 --> 18:43.600
I know Mario will turn up. Besides...

18:43.680 --> 18:45.960
I have full confidence
in Inspector Cuevas.

18:46.880 --> 18:48.320
Good night.

18:56.920 --> 18:59.880
Listen, Pablo.
Doña Lola's been asleep for a while,

18:59.960 --> 19:01.720
and I thought you and I could...

19:01.800 --> 19:04.760
No, no! Have you gone mad? No.

19:05.560 --> 19:08.000
I didn't know you were like this.

19:08.080 --> 19:10.160
Hey, honey, I'm a respectable woman.

19:10.240 --> 19:13.320
But we're engaged, that's another story.

19:13.400 --> 19:15.240
I just wanted to do what all couples do.

19:15.320 --> 19:19.480
-What they do when they're married.
-Pablo, that's nonsense!

19:19.560 --> 19:21.840
-We're close enough.
-I can't!

19:25.680 --> 19:27.080
Pablo, why not?

19:29.160 --> 19:32.240
-If it's because you don't like me...
-No, Marga, it's not that.

19:32.320 --> 19:34.280
Of course I do. How could I not like you?

19:34.840 --> 19:39.200
I like you a lot.
No, no. You're not the problem, I am.

19:39.280 --> 19:41.640
You see? You don't like me!

19:41.720 --> 19:44.560
I'm fine to eat a sandwich with,
but when it comes to--

19:44.640 --> 19:47.600
Marga, I can't... I can't.

19:47.680 --> 19:49.520
-But why?
-Look...

19:50.600 --> 19:52.680
I've got a little...

19:53.720 --> 19:56.840
-It's just a silly secret.
-We said there'd be no secrets.

19:56.920 --> 19:59.480
Okay. All right, all right. Here...

20:06.480 --> 20:09.080
Phimosis? What's that?

20:09.760 --> 20:12.800
-Is it like a pimple?
-Marga, it's not a pimple.

20:14.680 --> 20:15.760
Look...

20:16.960 --> 20:20.120
try to imagine... a tortoise...

20:21.720 --> 20:23.240
when it sticks its head out...

20:24.320 --> 20:26.280
-Or a squid...
-Pablo, please!

20:44.880 --> 20:48.320
This is the parish bulletin.
Why are you showing me this?

20:48.800 --> 20:50.360
Didn't you ask me to?

20:50.440 --> 20:53.000
But now I won't be able to forget it.

20:53.360 --> 20:55.320
Didn't you say we should have no secrets?

20:55.640 --> 20:58.680
Now I'm saying it's better
to have some secrets.

20:59.760 --> 21:01.160
Now who's here?

21:07.360 --> 21:08.960
Don Francisco, what...

21:09.800 --> 21:13.320
I'm sorry, but I couldn't wait
until morning. It's very important.

21:13.400 --> 21:17.240
-What is it?
-I'm looking for Lidia. Is she here?

21:17.320 --> 21:19.920
No, she isn't. I'm surprised, too, but...

21:20.000 --> 21:22.760
we thought maybe
she was having a drink after work.

21:23.280 --> 21:24.280
Is something wrong?

21:24.960 --> 21:27.080
Lidia left work with Carlos.

21:27.160 --> 21:29.440
They had an argument
in the street and Lidia...

21:29.520 --> 21:31.480
-she fainted.
-What?

21:31.560 --> 21:33.840
Carlos says she was able
to leave the hospital,

21:33.920 --> 21:36.880
but she didn't want to tell him
what had happened to her.

21:37.720 --> 21:39.160
Why did they argue?

21:40.080 --> 21:41.360
Hello.

21:41.440 --> 21:45.120
I'm leaving now,
so you can talk in private.

21:45.200 --> 21:47.360
-Pablo...
-No, no, it's all right.

21:47.440 --> 21:51.960
If you need anything, let me know,
but I don't want to... pry.

21:53.920 --> 21:55.000
Good night.

21:55.080 --> 21:56.160
Good night.

21:58.880 --> 22:02.120
Carlos discovered that Lidia and I
were together the other night.

22:02.200 --> 22:04.040
Together? Very together?

22:04.120 --> 22:06.480
In the house...

22:06.560 --> 22:09.320
Well, it's... I didn't know that.

22:10.080 --> 22:11.560
I mean, it isn't...

22:12.640 --> 22:14.560
What matters is that Lidia's all right.

22:14.640 --> 22:17.600
That's why I'm here.
I'm not sure that she is.

22:17.680 --> 22:20.320
Carlos says it was a reaction
to medication she's taking.

22:20.400 --> 22:22.240
-Medication?
-Yes.

22:22.320 --> 22:23.800
But she's fit as a fiddle.

22:24.480 --> 22:27.720
Well, Lidia is Miss Secrets, so maybe...

22:27.800 --> 22:31.400
She's reserved even with her friends.
I'm glad it's not just with me.

22:31.800 --> 22:34.440
We should go to Carlota's house
to see if she knows anything.

22:34.520 --> 22:38.400
Good idea. I'll go to the hospital
to see if they know anything.

22:38.480 --> 22:40.400
This is my address.

22:40.480 --> 22:43.760
If you find out anything,
please, let me know.

22:44.520 --> 22:45.720
-Marga.
-Yes?

22:48.360 --> 22:49.760
I really appreciate this.

22:51.760 --> 22:55.160
Don't worry.
What matters now is finding her.

23:00.240 --> 23:02.320
Another? You're having another?

23:03.720 --> 23:07.400
All right, drink until you fall down,
but I think that...

23:07.480 --> 23:09.600
this silence is lasting too long.

23:09.680 --> 23:11.760
-Carlota--
-Don't "Carlota" me.

23:11.840 --> 23:13.040
Say something.

23:14.840 --> 23:17.840
-Like what?
-Sara opened her heart to you.

23:17.920 --> 23:20.400
She at least deserves
to hear your feelings about it.

23:21.080 --> 23:22.800
I wasn't expecting it.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.440
-How long have you been hiding it?
-That isn't important.

23:26.520 --> 23:29.880
Then what is? I don't know
what you expect me to say.

23:31.040 --> 23:34.560
First I catch you two kissing,
and now Sara feels she's a man.

23:34.640 --> 23:36.840
-Stop, Miguel!
-It's normal he feels like this.

23:36.920 --> 23:39.680
You're asking me to react
as if it were quite normal

23:39.760 --> 23:42.720
when our world is going to hell.

23:42.800 --> 23:44.840
-What am I in this relationship?
-You?

23:45.400 --> 23:48.720
You should think more about Sara
and less about yourself.

23:48.800 --> 23:52.240
I thought you were a modern man
who could adapt to new relationships.

23:52.320 --> 23:54.720
So did I, but maybe
you're asking too much.

23:57.160 --> 23:58.640
I should answer the door.

24:11.800 --> 24:14.080
Miguel, is Carlota here?

24:15.160 --> 24:17.800
-What is it, Marga?
-I need to talk to her.

24:18.360 --> 24:20.840
-Yes, come in.
-Thank you.

24:36.840 --> 24:40.320
Marga!
What are you doing here so late?

24:40.400 --> 24:42.640
She's come to celebrate
the proletarian victory.

24:43.200 --> 24:46.240
Maybe she can make
more sense of this than I can.

24:46.320 --> 24:48.640
Why don't you tell her? I'm leaving.

24:49.520 --> 24:50.480
Goodbye.

24:53.280 --> 24:55.880
Ignore him. He's had a bad day.

24:56.560 --> 24:58.760
Lidia's missing.
I thought she might be here.

24:59.960 --> 25:03.160
-Here?
-Carlos and Francisco argued and...

25:03.240 --> 25:05.880
-Lidia fainted in the street.
-What happened?

25:05.960 --> 25:09.320
Carlos took her to the hospital
and when she recovered, she left,

25:09.400 --> 25:12.840
-but she didn't come home.
-If she isn't here...

25:12.920 --> 25:14.240
We should go to Ángeles...

25:14.320 --> 25:16.160
-No, not after what happened.
-Carlota.

25:16.920 --> 25:18.440
Lidia comes first.

25:19.000 --> 25:20.120
All right.

25:21.520 --> 25:22.360
Let's go.

25:24.200 --> 25:25.840
-I'm sorry, Sara.
-Don't worry.

25:25.920 --> 25:28.520
-Let me know if you find out anything.
-Sure.

25:41.560 --> 25:43.560
-Ángeles.
-What are you doing here?

25:43.640 --> 25:45.560
-Can we come in?
-Of course.

25:46.640 --> 25:49.280
-Sorry to stop by so late, but--
-Just a minute.

25:49.960 --> 25:51.800
First of all, I want to apologize.

25:51.880 --> 25:55.040
I'm really sorry about what happened
with the strike,

25:55.120 --> 25:57.840
but I was in a very tough spot.

25:57.920 --> 26:01.360
That's not why we're here.
We're looking for Lidia.

26:01.440 --> 26:03.600
-Is she here?
-Girls.

26:05.280 --> 26:08.840
Thank God, Lidia! Where were you?
We were worried.

26:08.920 --> 26:10.800
How are you? Are you all right?

26:11.800 --> 26:13.080
Something's happened.

26:18.640 --> 26:21.000
Things have gotten really ugly.

26:22.240 --> 26:25.800
-Carlos must not find out about this.
-Are you sure? I mean...

26:26.360 --> 26:28.960
-He's the father.
-What about Francisco?

26:29.040 --> 26:32.400
He came looking for you
and he told me that you were--

26:32.480 --> 26:34.360
That we were giving it another chance.

26:34.880 --> 26:37.480
But I can't burden him with Carlos' son.

26:37.560 --> 26:40.760
-Maybe he'd want to do it.
-Marga, it isn't so easy.

26:41.760 --> 26:45.440
I love them both,
Carlos and Francisco, and...

26:46.960 --> 26:48.800
I'm losing my mind.

26:50.920 --> 26:53.360
I don't know if you can love
two people at once.

26:53.960 --> 26:57.360
Yes, you can,
and you don't have to feel bad because...

26:57.920 --> 27:00.880
-those things happen.
-They certainly do.

27:03.720 --> 27:05.640
I don't know how to deal with it all.

27:06.120 --> 27:08.320
It's my responsibility and...

27:09.880 --> 27:13.920
I think I should raise my child on my own,
far away from here.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.640
Are you insane?

27:15.720 --> 27:18.040
Spain isn't ready for unmarried mothers.

27:18.120 --> 27:21.480
That's precisely why, Marga.
I have to go far away.

27:21.560 --> 27:24.120
Just like that? You're running away,

27:24.200 --> 27:26.720
like always.
Just like Alba Romero would do.

27:26.800 --> 27:29.400
But this is different.
This involves two people.

27:29.480 --> 27:33.000
You can't keep your pregnancy a secret.

27:33.080 --> 27:37.240
-We all have secrets to hide, Carlota.
-All those secrets come out in the end.

27:37.320 --> 27:41.240
Those and the rest,
however much you try to hide them.

27:41.320 --> 27:43.560
I only hope you're wrong, Marga.

27:45.000 --> 27:48.640
Some secrets
are best kept hidden forever, right?

27:49.520 --> 27:51.480
Lidia, if you're talking about Mario,

27:52.360 --> 27:55.520
you needn't worry.
There's nothing to fear.

27:55.600 --> 27:59.000
I still think you should stay!
Don't you realize?

27:59.080 --> 28:02.160
Are you going to uproot your life
over two men?

28:02.240 --> 28:05.360
Are they going to decide your future?
Know what your future is?

28:05.440 --> 28:07.040
To go back to the company,

28:07.120 --> 28:09.760
finish your telephone project
and be successful.

28:10.680 --> 28:12.560
The decision is made, Carlota.

28:12.960 --> 28:16.040
All right, but don't count on me for help.

28:18.080 --> 28:20.880
-Carlota...
-Carlota, don't leave like that!

28:21.920 --> 28:24.280
Girls, please, don't fight.

28:30.000 --> 28:33.640
Carlota, wait. What's wrong with you?

28:33.720 --> 28:35.800
You're being unfair to her.
You, of all people.

28:35.880 --> 28:39.560
-Me? Why? What are you talking about?
-Nothing.

28:39.640 --> 28:42.960
No, you said earlier that
we all had secrets to keep.

28:43.040 --> 28:46.120
-You meant me, didn't you?
-I saw you kissing Sara.

28:48.720 --> 28:51.120
I know you don't have to explain.

28:51.200 --> 28:54.080
We're not friends.
Friends tell each other their secrets.

28:54.160 --> 28:56.920
Marga, it wasn't planned.
I just fell in love.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.760
-Things aren't black and white.
-I don't want to hear it!

28:59.840 --> 29:02.000
-Marga, please...
-Leave me alone!

29:06.560 --> 29:09.560
Why are you trying
to seduce Inspector Cuevas?

29:12.440 --> 29:13.800
Who told you that?

29:15.600 --> 29:18.040
Don't lie to me. I know everything.

29:19.280 --> 29:22.040
-Do you have something to tell me or not?
-No.

29:22.120 --> 29:24.680
You've got nothing to worry about.

29:24.760 --> 29:26.920
I told you,
I've got everything under control.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.080
Yes, that sounds very reassuring.

29:31.720 --> 29:33.880
Does he suspect you? Or us?

29:33.960 --> 29:36.920
No! Lidia, stop worrying.

29:38.880 --> 29:42.440
-I'm taking care of it.
-Ángeles, if you have a problem,

29:43.880 --> 29:47.400
we all have a problem.
Remember? We're in this together.

29:47.480 --> 29:49.320
You can't do this on your own.

29:49.400 --> 29:52.240
But you just said you're leaving forever.

29:52.320 --> 29:54.160
It doesn't sound like we'll be together.

29:54.240 --> 29:56.840
So, please, save your breath.

29:56.920 --> 29:59.360
I'm expecting a child.
What do you want me to do?

29:59.800 --> 30:01.240
If that child is a problem...

30:02.960 --> 30:04.560
there are ways to solve it.

30:05.760 --> 30:09.080
You told me that yourself
when I was pregnant with Mario's child.

30:09.720 --> 30:13.560
So it was all right for me,
but now it's different for you?

30:13.640 --> 30:14.880
It isn't the same.

30:16.200 --> 30:19.960
No? Why? What's the difference
between you and me?

30:20.040 --> 30:23.320
I can't tell you.
Ángeles, it's something...

30:25.360 --> 30:26.480
What?

30:27.320 --> 30:28.560
Forget it.

30:30.360 --> 30:31.360
You see?

30:32.880 --> 30:35.760
You ask me to tell you everything,

30:35.840 --> 30:39.440
and then you hide in your world,
in your past, in your secrets...

30:40.040 --> 30:42.520
Don't ask of others
what you yourself can't give.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
Get out.

30:51.560 --> 30:52.560
Get out.

30:54.200 --> 30:56.720
From now on,
we all look out for ourselves.

31:56.680 --> 32:00.360
My God, Lidia, where were you?

32:00.440 --> 32:02.160
I was so worried.

32:06.920 --> 32:08.000
What's wrong?

32:09.160 --> 32:12.600
I wish I'd never lost you
in that train station.

32:14.560 --> 32:17.480
When I was a child,
I had to learn to defend myself,

32:18.480 --> 32:22.280
and know who I could and couldn't trust.

32:24.000 --> 32:25.560
And I was taken advantage of.

32:26.920 --> 32:28.320
I got pregnant.

32:31.080 --> 32:32.480
But Victoria helped me.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.200
I had an abortion.

32:36.640 --> 32:39.520
Then... I couldn't--

32:39.600 --> 32:40.760
I'm sorry.

32:42.160 --> 32:43.880
You did the right thing.

32:46.280 --> 32:47.400
I think so.

32:51.640 --> 32:53.960
You're the first person I've told.

32:57.120 --> 32:59.000
I couldn't even tell the girls.

33:03.640 --> 33:05.480
Why are you telling me now?

33:06.560 --> 33:07.840
What's changed?

33:12.280 --> 33:14.080
I'm pregnant with Carlos' baby.

33:18.120 --> 33:21.360
I'm not going back to him. I can't.

33:22.440 --> 33:24.360
But I want to have this child.

33:27.840 --> 33:29.560
Before you came back...

33:31.200 --> 33:32.720
he seduced me.

33:34.080 --> 33:37.520
That was when he stole
my idea for the public telephones.

33:44.840 --> 33:47.920
I can't go through all that again.
I don't want...

33:49.040 --> 33:52.000
to wonder again
what would have happened if...

33:54.200 --> 33:56.200
I can't be with you like this.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.520
I can't force you.

34:02.160 --> 34:04.400
I can't force you to carry this burden.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
The best thing is for me to leave.

34:14.280 --> 34:15.440
Leave Madrid.

34:17.600 --> 34:19.920
It's the only way to do it on my own.

34:23.080 --> 34:24.080
It's what's best.

34:25.600 --> 34:26.800
For you, too.

34:35.840 --> 34:37.199
-I'm sorry.
-Get out.

34:41.280 --> 34:42.320
Get out.

34:55.639 --> 34:59.160
At times we remain silent because
confessing means accepting our fears.

35:07.400 --> 35:09.360
Secrets protect us.

35:09.920 --> 35:12.040
And whether or not we confess them,

35:14.200 --> 35:16.080
there are always consequences.

35:19.240 --> 35:21.480
Now it was time to face mine.

35:30.840 --> 35:33.720
-What do you think of the place?
-It's all right.

35:34.040 --> 35:35.120
I don't like it.

35:36.080 --> 35:38.880
-Why don't we go home?
-I've thought about this.

35:40.160 --> 35:43.280
It's just an interview with the doctor.
If it goes well...

35:44.960 --> 35:46.120
Are you all right?

35:48.040 --> 35:50.480
-Is it because Miguel didn't come?
-Yes.

35:53.080 --> 35:55.800
Sara, I've never told you this...

35:57.200 --> 36:00.400
but a while ago,
Miguel had some bad habits

36:00.880 --> 36:03.160
and he hung around with the wrong crowd.

36:03.840 --> 36:05.920
I helped him get away from all that.

36:07.040 --> 36:10.440
And now that you need our support,
it hurts me.

36:10.520 --> 36:13.400
-It hurts me that he's so selfish.
-Don't worry, Carlota.

36:13.480 --> 36:14.520
Don't worry.

36:15.600 --> 36:17.520
-It'll be fine.
-Well...

36:18.280 --> 36:20.640
It's more common than many people think.

36:21.400 --> 36:25.600
Many men and women
feel that they aren't in the right body.

36:26.400 --> 36:30.480
You're at a crossroads, Sara,
but you needn't go through it alone.

36:30.560 --> 36:33.480
She isn't alone. She has friends
who love and support her.

36:33.560 --> 36:38.160
I'm delighted. It's very important to have
the support of your loved ones.

36:38.240 --> 36:40.360
Can you help me understand
what's happening?

36:40.440 --> 36:41.360
Yes.

36:41.960 --> 36:46.000
Trust in our experience.
Psychiatry has advanced a lot recently.

36:46.080 --> 36:48.320
-We don't stigmatize anyone here.
-Yeah.

36:48.400 --> 36:51.600
What are your methods?
You still haven't explained them.

36:52.360 --> 36:55.440
I'm touched to see how much you worry
about your friend. Believe me,

36:55.520 --> 36:57.120
she'll be in good hands with us.

36:57.680 --> 37:01.280
I suggest she stay here this morning
to fill out some forms.

37:01.360 --> 37:03.800
And if we conclude that we can help you,

37:04.560 --> 37:08.560
we'll offer you the possibility
to stay here for a month.

37:08.640 --> 37:10.280
A month? But, Sara...

37:10.360 --> 37:13.280
It's the amount of time
that others have needed.

37:13.960 --> 37:15.960
Well, I'll leave you alone to decide.

37:16.520 --> 37:20.240
A nurse will come for you in a while.
And if you decide to trust in us,

37:20.320 --> 37:22.600
-we'll start as soon as possible.
-Very well.

37:22.680 --> 37:24.000
-Goodbye.
-Thank you.

37:34.320 --> 37:37.360
We could start by looking
at the facilities, couldn't we?

37:38.120 --> 37:40.800
Or talk to some of the patients
to see what they say.

37:41.560 --> 37:43.000
Sara, there's no rush.

37:44.520 --> 37:48.520
I've been thinking about it for 27 years,
fighting it on my own.

37:48.600 --> 37:51.120
And I think that doctor knows how I feel.

37:52.480 --> 37:54.440
A month flies by, Carlota, you'll see.

37:55.520 --> 37:58.240
I want to do this. I'm prepared.

38:00.440 --> 38:02.560
Send me a suitcase with the things I need?

38:02.640 --> 38:05.720
Of course.
But call me when you're settled in.

38:05.800 --> 38:06.880
Yes.

38:07.800 --> 38:12.000
Sara, if you change your mind,
it's all right.

38:13.480 --> 38:16.480
Call me and I'll come and get you, okay?

38:27.640 --> 38:31.720
Lidia, are you leaving today?

38:31.800 --> 38:34.400
I have to stop by the company
to submit my resignation.

38:37.760 --> 38:41.040
Earlier, I was remembering the day
we started working there.

38:41.120 --> 38:43.040
-Remember?
-You only had your suitcase.

38:43.120 --> 38:47.120
Yes! What a terrible day.

38:47.200 --> 38:49.520
-I got lost. I wanted to go home.
-You were robbed.

38:49.600 --> 38:50.520
I was robbed.

38:51.880 --> 38:53.960
But now, thinking about it,

38:54.040 --> 38:56.480
it was one of the happiest days
of my life.

38:57.120 --> 38:59.720
Yes, I know it might sound a bit odd...

39:01.440 --> 39:03.360
but it was the day I met all of you.

39:06.360 --> 39:08.720
Lidia, I didn't want you to leave...

39:10.360 --> 39:11.920
without knowing this.

39:20.840 --> 39:22.560
Why didn't you tell me?

39:22.640 --> 39:24.960
Well, you've got enough on your plate.

39:26.040 --> 39:28.120
And here, take this.

39:28.200 --> 39:32.080
It's temporary, no church, no time.
It's a disaster right now,

39:32.960 --> 39:35.680
but I wanted you to know
that I'd love it if you were there.

39:37.600 --> 39:39.520
It won't be the same without you.

39:43.240 --> 39:46.160
-I'm really going to miss you.
-And I'll miss you.

39:48.040 --> 39:50.160
And don't feel bad about yesterday.

39:50.720 --> 39:54.080
I imagine how hard it must be
to make that decision.

39:54.600 --> 39:56.160
I know you're doing it for your child.

39:56.840 --> 39:58.600
I hope Carlota understands it someday.

39:58.680 --> 40:02.560
Of course she will.
You know she's stubborn as a mule.

40:02.640 --> 40:03.880
Yes.

40:03.960 --> 40:07.000
But at times we don't know
why we do what we do.

40:07.560 --> 40:10.240
But it makes me really sad because...

40:11.120 --> 40:15.160
I'd like to help you look after the baby
and be a kind of Aunt Marga.

40:16.600 --> 40:18.600
You've always been
like a big sister for me.

40:19.560 --> 40:23.200
-Why are you crying?
-Because I'm so sad.

40:24.640 --> 40:27.720
-It isn't goodbye forever.
-Do you promise?

40:27.800 --> 40:30.320
-Well, I've got my invitation.
-Yes.

40:30.400 --> 40:31.840
I can't miss this.

40:38.120 --> 40:39.200
Hello?

40:39.280 --> 40:42.400
Good morning. You have a call
from Bilbao. Will you accept it?

40:42.960 --> 40:44.120
From Bilbao?

40:44.640 --> 40:46.720
-Yes, please.
-I'll put you through.

40:50.320 --> 40:51.400
Hello?

40:52.680 --> 40:55.040
Hello, I don't hear you.

41:00.880 --> 41:03.400
Listen, if this is some kind of joke,
it isn't funny.

41:37.920 --> 41:39.160
Coming!

41:52.080 --> 41:53.640
Lidia has finally reappeared.

41:54.440 --> 41:57.760
She has a meeting with Uribe at 8:00.

42:00.560 --> 42:02.520
That's it. I wanted you to know.

42:04.800 --> 42:07.160
I know, I saw her.

42:07.720 --> 42:09.760
You saw her? And you didn't tell me?

42:09.840 --> 42:11.720
I'm worried about her, too.

42:16.960 --> 42:21.320
You don't deserve to know about her
because you don't deserve her.

42:25.040 --> 42:29.120
You're right. I'm a miserable bastard,
and I've been blinded by resentment.

42:30.680 --> 42:32.080
But I want to fix things.

42:32.160 --> 42:34.760
Did she tell you what the doctor told her?

42:37.160 --> 42:41.320
Francisco, please, I want to help her.

42:45.720 --> 42:46.800
Look...

42:51.720 --> 42:53.360
Go away.

42:57.880 --> 43:01.040
I want to be alone. Leave.

43:52.880 --> 43:54.000
Come on! Come on!

44:42.920 --> 44:46.240
The good thing about secrets
is that you are their sole owner,

44:48.360 --> 44:52.200
and at any time, you can take steps
to change the direction of your life.

45:00.960 --> 45:04.840
But you can't always predict
the consequences this will have on others.

45:12.800 --> 45:15.600
That's why you have to be prepared
for anything.

45:27.920 --> 45:28.760
How are you?

45:36.000 --> 45:37.640
Leave me alone, please.

45:40.840 --> 45:43.080
Lidia, don't do it. Don't leave.

45:43.720 --> 45:46.640
You can't give up your dreams, everything.

45:47.600 --> 45:51.480
You're leaving behind a lot of people
who love you. Marga, Carlota, Ángeles...

45:52.040 --> 45:53.000
and me.

45:53.680 --> 45:56.320
You're running away,
and you're not a coward.

45:56.400 --> 45:57.800
What's he talking about?

45:58.880 --> 46:02.200
-Leave us alone, please.
-Lidia, what's going on?

46:02.280 --> 46:03.760
Are you leaving?

46:10.200 --> 46:11.600
I'm pregnant.

46:16.800 --> 46:20.000
And no one but me
will determine my future.
