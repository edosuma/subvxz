01:27.221 --> 01:29.221
- Whoa!
- Sorry, Chief.

01:29.223 --> 01:30.856
That's okay, Teeny.

01:30.858 --> 01:32.558
I should've
seen you coming.

01:32.560 --> 01:36.628
But I was busy
star gazing.

01:38.765 --> 01:41.800
Your cave crystals
really do look like
stars, Chief Knuckles.

01:41.802 --> 01:43.702
I wish we had more.

01:43.704 --> 01:45.637
I do, too, Teeny,

01:45.639 --> 01:48.140
but you know how rare
cave crystals are.

01:48.142 --> 01:50.776
Each troll
only gets one.

01:50.778 --> 01:52.978
- Like this.

( laughs )
Okay, have fun,
everyone.

01:56.417 --> 01:57.749
Bye, Chief Knuckles.

01:57.751 --> 01:59.318
See ya, Chief.

01:59.320 --> 02:01.587
All right, it's
my turn to hide.

02:01.589 --> 02:03.122
Start counting.

02:03.124 --> 02:06.258
One, two, three...

02:06.260 --> 02:07.793
Here we go.

02:07.795 --> 02:09.795

02:09.797 --> 02:12.631
Oh, whew.

02:12.633 --> 02:15.968
Oh, I've never hidden
over here before.

02:15.970 --> 02:18.504
It's really dark.

02:18.506 --> 02:20.239
Ah, that's better.

02:20.241 --> 02:22.508
They'll never find me
in here.

02:22.510 --> 02:24.810
( gasping )
What's this?

02:24.812 --> 02:26.678
Hey!

02:26.680 --> 02:29.648
Glorious light,
at last.

02:29.650 --> 02:32.651
Huh. All I've had
is this pathetic little candle

02:32.653 --> 02:35.420
to light up this dark,
dreary cave.

02:35.422 --> 02:39.424
Hey, give that back,
you flying gnome.

02:39.426 --> 02:42.794
Flying gnome?
I'm a fliegel.

02:42.796 --> 02:44.696
Grotta the fliegel,
to you.

02:44.698 --> 02:45.964
What's a fliegel?

02:45.966 --> 02:48.433
( scoffs ) You don't even know
what a fliegel is?

02:48.435 --> 02:50.669
You must not get
out of your cave much.

glowing crystal thingies.

03:38.819 --> 03:41.386
Well, maybe you could ask
Chief Knuckles for some.

03:41.388 --> 03:44.089
Ask? I don't ask,
I tell.

03:44.091 --> 03:45.991
And I'm telling you
to get me some more

03:45.993 --> 03:47.893
of the little crystals.

03:47.895 --> 03:49.161
You could be
a little nicer about it.

03:49.163 --> 03:51.730
I could,
but I don't have to,

in this mess.

04:23.964 --> 04:25.130
Flinch!

04:25.132 --> 04:27.633
Yes, Grotta.

04:27.635 --> 04:28.900
Find something
to put this in.

04:28.902 --> 04:30.702
Right away, Grotta.

04:33.206 --> 04:34.773
( shrieks )
It's dark!

04:34.775 --> 04:36.975
Flinch, pick it up!

04:36.977 --> 04:38.243
Pick it up!

04:38.245 --> 04:40.612
Sorry, Grotta.
Please don't zap me.

04:40.614 --> 04:41.980
Are you afraid
of the dark?

04:41.982 --> 04:44.783
I am not afraid
of anything, mister.

04:44.785 --> 04:47.619
Now, take this bucket
and fill it up

04:47.621 --> 04:49.955
with those glowing crystals.

04:49.957 --> 04:52.057
- Or else.
- Or else what?

04:52.059 --> 04:54.926
Or else I turn you
into a salamander.

04:54.928 --> 04:56.862
Commanda salamanda!

04:59.232 --> 05:01.967
- Ah!
- Take it from me.

05:01.969 --> 05:03.435
You don't want
to mess with Grotta.

05:03.437 --> 05:05.504
Now, get me what I want,

05:05.506 --> 05:07.973
and no one
will get salamandered.

05:07.975 --> 05:10.409
And don't go telling
anyone about this.

05:10.411 --> 05:13.645
You go blabbin',
and I go zappin'.

05:13.647 --> 05:16.014
Just bring me
those crystals.

05:16.016 --> 05:17.816
Got it, troll?

05:17.818 --> 05:19.818
Yes. Okay.
I will.

05:19.820 --> 05:23.689
Flinch, be more careful
with my crystal.

05:23.691 --> 05:25.757
Sorry, Grotta.

05:25.759 --> 05:28.360
( frustrated sigh )
You just can't scare up
good help these days.

05:28.362 --> 05:30.162
- ( panting )
- Whoa.

05:30.164 --> 05:32.164
- Hey!
- Sorry.

05:32.166 --> 05:34.499
We're supposed to find you,
Gnarlie.

05:34.501 --> 05:36.034
What happened?

05:36.036 --> 05:37.636
Uh, nothing.

05:37.638 --> 05:39.438
I just don't wanna
play anymore.

05:39.440 --> 05:40.672
Aww!

05:40.674 --> 05:43.108
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

05:43.110 --> 05:45.310
I just feel like
doing something else now.

05:45.312 --> 05:48.180
Hey, have you ever mined
for cave crystals?

05:48.182 --> 05:49.881
You mine for those?

05:49.883 --> 05:52.050
Yeah. It's really fun.

05:52.052 --> 05:53.218
You get to bang
big hammers.

05:53.220 --> 05:56.021
- Wanna try it?
- Sure.

05:57.724 --> 06:00.292
Hey, I think
I found something.

06:00.294 --> 06:01.993
Ooh, let me see,
let me see.

06:01.995 --> 06:05.063
Oh. It's only
an emerald.

06:05.065 --> 06:07.032
Well, isn't that
a precious gem?

06:07.034 --> 06:10.535
But it doesn't glow
like a cave crystal.

06:11.804 --> 06:14.072
Hey, I found
something, too.

06:14.074 --> 06:15.707
Good job, Teeny.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.542
Oh, but it's
just a diamond.

06:17.544 --> 06:19.077
( sighs )
It's no use.

06:19.079 --> 06:20.979
We've been at this
for hours,

06:20.981 --> 06:23.582
and we've only found
one cave crystal.

06:23.584 --> 06:26.084
We're never gonna mine
a whole bucket full of 'em,

06:26.086 --> 06:27.719
and I'm gonna be...

06:27.721 --> 06:28.820
Gonna be what, Gnarlie?

06:28.822 --> 06:30.589
Tired.

06:30.591 --> 06:33.558
I'm gonna be tired
from all this mining.

06:33.560 --> 06:35.427
( yawns )

06:35.429 --> 06:38.897
I'm gonna go...
rest for a while, Sofia.

06:38.899 --> 06:40.365
I'll see you later.

06:40.367 --> 06:41.933
That's strange.

06:41.935 --> 06:44.336
I've never seen Gnarlie
act like that before.

06:44.338 --> 06:46.037
Me either.

06:46.039 --> 06:48.073
I think there's
something wrong with him.

06:48.075 --> 06:50.275
- What do we do?
- We find out what it is.

06:50.277 --> 06:52.944
Wait for me, Sofia.

06:56.349 --> 06:59.084
Our cave is the other way.
Where is he going?

06:59.086 --> 07:00.952
I don't know.

07:04.357 --> 07:06.892
- Hello?
- FLINCH: Ah, you're back.

07:06.894 --> 07:09.127
Did you bring
the crystals?

07:09.129 --> 07:10.796
I tried, but I
could only find one.

07:10.798 --> 07:12.364
Oh, this is not good.

07:12.366 --> 07:14.800
Listen, I thought if
I told her the truth,

07:14.802 --> 07:16.535
maybe Grotta
would understand.

07:16.537 --> 07:18.403
You thought what?!

07:18.405 --> 07:20.972
( laughing )
Oh, that's a good one.

07:20.974 --> 07:23.108
You know what happened
the last time

07:23.110 --> 07:25.143
someone thought Grotta
would understand?

07:25.145 --> 07:26.778
No. What?

07:26.780 --> 07:29.981
Put it this way.
I wasn't always a mole.

07:29.983 --> 07:32.217
( gasps )
Grotta did that to you?

07:32.219 --> 07:34.319
Yeah. Do yourself
a favor

07:34.321 --> 07:36.555
and do what she says.

07:36.557 --> 07:38.156
Flinch, where are
my throw pillows?

07:38.158 --> 07:40.792
So, the trembling troll
is back.

07:40.794 --> 07:42.160
Did you bring
the crystals?

07:42.162 --> 07:44.129
Listen, I tried
mining for some,

07:44.131 --> 07:46.131
but I only found one.

07:46.133 --> 07:47.499
They're very rare.

07:47.501 --> 07:49.801
Ah, yes.

07:49.803 --> 07:52.437
This makes me
very unhappy.

07:52.439 --> 07:56.074
And when I'm not happy,
nobody's happy!

07:57.143 --> 07:58.643
It's true.

07:58.645 --> 08:00.345
I haven't been happy
for two years.

08:00.347 --> 08:02.848
You're gonna bring me
more crystals,

08:02.850 --> 08:06.852
and you're gonna do it
by the time this candle
burns out.

08:06.854 --> 08:09.287
And if I see it melt
all the way down,

08:09.289 --> 08:12.123
and you still haven't
brought me what I want,

08:12.125 --> 08:15.794
boo-hoo, I'm coming
for you.

08:15.796 --> 08:18.263
Uh, okay.
Okay.

08:18.265 --> 08:20.599
We have to rethink
this whole layout, Flinch.

08:20.601 --> 08:23.368
Ugh. Move the rock sofa
back over there.

08:23.370 --> 08:26.204
- Again?
- Uh-uh, Flinch.

08:26.206 --> 08:28.540
Uh, I mean,
right away, Grotta.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.811
- Gnarlie.
- Sofia.

08:32.813 --> 08:36.014
You two shouldn't have come.
You have to leave now.

08:36.016 --> 08:37.716
Why didn't you tell us
about that mean little...

08:37.718 --> 08:39.618
What is she anyway?

08:39.620 --> 08:41.219
She's a fliegel.

08:41.221 --> 08:42.687
She said if I told anyone,

08:42.689 --> 08:44.623
she'd turn me into
a salamander.

08:44.625 --> 08:47.225
What am I gonna
do, Sofia?

08:47.227 --> 08:50.228
I can't just make
a bucket of cave crystals
appear out of nowhere.

08:50.230 --> 08:53.064
And I only have until
Grotta's candle burns out.

08:53.066 --> 08:55.066
Well, you can't
make them appear,

08:55.068 --> 08:57.235
but I know someone
who might be able to.

08:57.237 --> 09:00.205
Oh, but Grotta told me
not to tell anybody.

09:00.207 --> 09:02.173
And now you wanna
tell somebody else?

09:02.175 --> 09:04.009
It's only to get you
those cave crystals.

09:04.011 --> 09:06.511
Then everything
will be fine.

09:06.513 --> 09:08.213
Don't worry, Gnarlie.
I won't let you

09:08.215 --> 09:10.749
get turned into
a salamander.

09:32.873 --> 09:35.273
Oh. What are you
doing up there?

09:35.275 --> 09:39.678
I was just...
practicing my levitation spell.

09:39.680 --> 09:41.947
Well, could you maybe
come down here for a minute?

09:41.949 --> 09:43.114
I need your help.

09:43.116 --> 09:46.117
Give me one reason
why I should.

09:46.119 --> 09:48.286
- I'll give you the ladder.
- That'll do.

09:51.090 --> 09:52.724
Right. What is it
this time?

09:52.726 --> 09:55.260
Do you know a spell
that can conjure up
cave crystals

09:55.262 --> 09:56.628
for my troll friend?

09:56.630 --> 09:59.731
Hmm. Cave crystals, eh?

09:59.733 --> 10:01.633
Let's see.

10:01.635 --> 10:04.569

10:08.542 --> 10:12.744
Should be right next to
the sapphire seeds.

10:12.746 --> 10:14.312
Of course, here it is.

10:14.314 --> 10:17.549
Powers of the earth,

10:17.551 --> 10:19.918
above and below,

10:19.920 --> 10:23.054
conjure a pile of
crystals that glow.

10:24.323 --> 10:26.558
That's not right.

10:26.560 --> 10:29.828
- My workshop!
Shoo, shoo.
- ( crash )

10:29.830 --> 10:32.397
Oh, shoo, you flightless
flappers.

10:34.734 --> 10:36.167
What happened?

10:36.169 --> 10:38.436
Oh, this isn't
diamond dust.

10:38.438 --> 10:40.171
( sniffs )

10:40.173 --> 10:42.340
- It's eggshell powder.
- ( squawks )

10:43.676 --> 10:47.178
I suppose that explains
the chickens.

10:47.180 --> 10:49.447
Well, do you have
any diamond dust?

10:49.449 --> 10:51.149
Mmm, no.

10:51.151 --> 10:52.317
It appears
I'm all out.

10:52.319 --> 10:54.352
I told Gnarlie
I'd help him.

10:54.354 --> 10:56.154
Help him with
what exactly?

10:56.156 --> 10:59.157
This mean fliegel
is going to turn him
into a salamander

10:59.159 --> 11:00.859
if he doesn't
give her cave crystals.

11:00.861 --> 11:02.927
- A fliegel?
- Yes.

11:02.929 --> 11:06.331
Oh, I've dealt with
those bossy little
cave dwellers before.

11:06.333 --> 11:09.334
- You have?
- They think
they're so powerful,

11:09.336 --> 11:11.803
but there isn't
a fliegel alive
who can match wands

11:11.805 --> 11:14.205
with a royal sorcerer
such as myself.

11:14.207 --> 11:16.541
So, you'll help us?

11:16.543 --> 11:19.277
I am always happy
to rid the kingdom

11:19.279 --> 11:20.712
of a pesky fliegel.

11:20.714 --> 11:23.848
Thank you, Mr. Cedric.
You're the best.

11:23.850 --> 11:25.784
Yes, I am.

11:26.819 --> 11:28.353
Don't worry, Gnarlie.

11:28.355 --> 11:30.355
Mr. Cedric
is a great sorcerer.

11:30.357 --> 11:32.390
He'll take care of
Grotta for you.

11:32.392 --> 11:34.726
Are you sure?
She's pretty powerful.

11:34.728 --> 11:36.394
Oh, poppycock.

11:36.396 --> 11:38.396
I shall make
magical mincemeat

11:38.398 --> 11:39.731
out of that fliegel.

11:39.733 --> 11:41.733
Oh, if you say so.

11:41.735 --> 11:44.703
GROTTA: A little more
to the left.

11:44.705 --> 11:47.138
A little more
to the right.

11:47.140 --> 11:49.841
Yes, Grotta.

11:49.843 --> 11:52.410
There. All done.

11:52.412 --> 11:54.212
Finally.

11:57.349 --> 11:59.984
- This looks dreadful.
- What?!

11:59.986 --> 12:02.654
Ugh, everything's in
the wrong place.

12:02.656 --> 12:04.155
Start over.

12:04.157 --> 12:05.724
Start over?

12:05.726 --> 12:07.425
But everything
is made of stone.

12:07.427 --> 12:09.360
Really heavy stone.

12:09.362 --> 12:14.399
Everything except you,
my darling Flinch.

12:14.401 --> 12:16.134
But I can fix that.

12:17.103 --> 12:18.570
What should we move first?

12:18.572 --> 12:20.371
How about
the two-ton couch?

12:20.373 --> 12:22.741
CEDRIC: See here, fliegel.

12:23.676 --> 12:25.443
Who are you?

12:25.445 --> 12:27.112
Oh!

12:27.114 --> 12:29.247
I am Cedric
the Sensational.

12:29.249 --> 12:33.284
Royal sorcerer to
King Roland the second.

12:33.286 --> 12:35.286
And Princess Sofia
of Enchancia.

12:35.288 --> 12:38.123
We've come to ask you
to leave Gnarlie alone.

12:38.125 --> 12:40.725
More specifically,
we've come to politely

12:40.727 --> 12:43.394
<i> tell you  </i> to leave
him alone.

12:43.396 --> 12:45.897
Yeah, leave Gnarlie alone!

12:45.899 --> 12:48.399
Or face
my awesome power.

12:48.401 --> 12:52.036
Too bad I have
awesome-er powers.

12:52.038 --> 12:53.671
Uh, I'm not sure
that's a word.

12:55.307 --> 12:58.209
Uh, I mean, it's the most
awesome-est word ever.

12:58.211 --> 13:00.979
Let's see what
you got, sorcerer.

13:00.981 --> 13:03.314
Oh, you're about to,
fliegel.

13:03.316 --> 13:05.984
Begonicus!

13:06.919 --> 13:09.454
- Not again!
- What happened?

13:09.456 --> 13:13.091
I forgot to wipe off
the eggshell powder.

13:13.093 --> 13:15.393
Commanda salamanda!

13:17.663 --> 13:20.899
- Mr. Cedric!
- ( Grotta laughs )

13:20.901 --> 13:22.834
I told you before, troll.

13:22.836 --> 13:25.136
You do what I say
or else.

13:25.138 --> 13:28.273
Oh, Mr. Cedric, I'm so sorry
I got you into this.

13:28.275 --> 13:29.841
You're sorry?

13:29.843 --> 13:32.577
I'm the one
who's a salamander.

13:32.579 --> 13:34.345
It could've been worse.

13:34.347 --> 13:36.481
Now, don't you have
some cave crystals

13:36.483 --> 13:38.149
to fetch for me?

13:38.151 --> 13:41.319
But I told you.
I couldn't find
any more.

13:41.321 --> 13:44.122
- What about
the ceiling stars?
- Sh. Teeny.

13:44.124 --> 13:45.590
Ceiling stars!

13:45.592 --> 13:48.259
You keep crystals
on the ceiling of your caves?

13:48.261 --> 13:49.661
You can't take those.

13:49.663 --> 13:51.629
They're our most
precious possessions.

13:51.631 --> 13:56.267
Well, they're going to be
my most precious possessions.

13:56.269 --> 13:57.969
You know, I'd hurry.

13:57.971 --> 13:59.771
If I see this candle
burn all the way down,

13:59.773 --> 14:01.306
and I don't
have my crystals,

14:01.308 --> 14:03.441
it'll be the lizard life
for all of you,

14:03.443 --> 14:06.277
and anyone else
who tries to stop me.

14:06.279 --> 14:08.112
Now get out of here!

14:10.516 --> 14:14.219
Guess I've gotta give her
some of our ceiling crystals.

14:14.221 --> 14:16.654
No, Gnarlie, there's
got to be another way.

14:16.656 --> 14:19.958
- Like what?
- I don't know.
But I'm going to find out.

14:19.960 --> 14:22.527
Would you watch
Mr. Cedric for me, Teeny?

14:22.529 --> 14:24.362
Sure. He's cute.

14:24.364 --> 14:25.563
I'll be
right back.

14:25.565 --> 14:27.532
Hurry.

14:31.737 --> 14:33.538
- Mom.
- Sofia?

14:33.540 --> 14:35.240
Do you have a minute?

14:35.242 --> 14:37.809
I always have time
for you, Sofia.

14:37.811 --> 14:39.911
What is it?

14:39.913 --> 14:42.247
You see, I've got
this friend,

14:42.249 --> 14:43.748
and there's a really
mean fliegel

14:43.750 --> 14:45.583
threatening to use
her magic on him

14:45.585 --> 14:46.651
if he doesn't do
what she says.

14:46.653 --> 14:48.820
A friend, huh?

14:48.822 --> 14:51.723
Are you sure we're not
talking about you, Sofia?

14:51.725 --> 14:53.258
No, it's one
of the trolls.

14:53.260 --> 14:55.159
I see.

14:55.161 --> 14:58.029
Well, has your troll friend
tried telling this fliegel

14:58.031 --> 15:00.531
- to stop bothering him?
- It didn't work.

15:00.533 --> 15:04.035
Oh. Has he tried going
to someone in charge,
like Chief Knuckles?

15:04.037 --> 15:05.870
He's not supposed
to tell anyone.

15:05.872 --> 15:07.906
He has to.

15:07.908 --> 15:09.707
Then Chief Knuckles
and the other trolls
can help your friend

15:09.709 --> 15:11.242
stand up to this fliegel.

15:11.244 --> 15:13.244
Do you really think
that will stop her?

15:13.246 --> 15:14.445
I do.

15:14.447 --> 15:16.447
Okay.
Thanks, Mom.

15:28.761 --> 15:30.595
I can't do it.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.263
Oh, do you ever sleep?

15:32.265 --> 15:33.898
( giggling )

15:33.900 --> 15:36.467
Stop. Get away
from me, you
clingy troll.

15:40.773 --> 15:44.042
There. You look
so pretty, Mr. Cedric.

15:46.278 --> 15:49.547
Oh, the humanity.

15:49.549 --> 15:50.815
I talked to my mom,

15:50.817 --> 15:53.318
and I think I know
how to fix everything,

15:53.320 --> 15:55.720
- including you,
Mr. Cedric.
- Finally.

15:55.722 --> 15:58.056
- Where's Gnarlie?
- Right here.

15:58.058 --> 16:00.058
I just couldn't
do it, Sofia.

16:00.060 --> 16:02.460
I couldn't take
our ceiling stars.

16:02.462 --> 16:03.828
You don't
have to, Gnarlie.

16:03.830 --> 16:05.630
There's another way
out of this.

16:05.632 --> 16:07.632
You have to get help
from Chief Knuckles.

16:07.634 --> 16:10.501
I don't want him to get
turned into a salamander.

16:10.503 --> 16:12.570
The only real way
to deal with a bully

16:12.572 --> 16:14.405
is to get help.

16:14.407 --> 16:16.074
Time's up, troll.

16:16.076 --> 16:19.911
This candle is finished,
and so are you.

16:19.913 --> 16:21.913
I want those crystals
now!

16:21.915 --> 16:23.147
You leave him alone!

16:23.149 --> 16:25.483
Aw, okay, Princess.

16:25.485 --> 16:27.352
I'll pick on
you instead.

16:27.354 --> 16:29.153
Capturus Princesso!

16:29.155 --> 16:32.090
No!

16:32.092 --> 16:34.492
Now, I'm taking
the princess back to my cave

16:34.494 --> 16:36.694
until you get me
those crystals from the ceiling.

16:36.696 --> 16:38.696
All you have to do
is bring them to me,

16:38.698 --> 16:40.965
and I will let her go.

16:40.967 --> 16:43.768
Don't listen
to her, Gnarlie.
Remember what I told you.

16:43.770 --> 16:45.770
You won't get away
with this.

16:45.772 --> 16:48.606
That bow looks pretty
on you, lizard lips.

16:52.378 --> 16:54.512
What are you
gonna do, Gnarlie?

16:54.514 --> 16:56.781
I'm gonna take
Sofia's advice, Teeny.

17:02.321 --> 17:05.556
You did the right thing
coming to us about this,
Gnarlie.

17:05.558 --> 17:07.625
I'm sorry I didn't
come sooner, Chief Knuckles.

17:07.627 --> 17:09.127
I was scared.

17:09.129 --> 17:11.629
No shame in that.
Any of us would be.

17:11.631 --> 17:13.531
But now,
your friend's in trouble,

17:13.533 --> 17:15.633
and you
have to save her.

17:15.635 --> 17:17.902
- I can't.
- Don't worry.

17:17.904 --> 17:20.471
We will all face
the fliegel
together, Gnarlie.

17:20.473 --> 17:22.540
But you have to
lead the way.

17:22.542 --> 17:24.409
Me? Why?

17:24.411 --> 17:26.577
To show this bully
of a fliegel

17:26.579 --> 17:28.646
that she can't
push you around.

17:30.582 --> 17:34.218
Flinch, I thought I told you
to put up the mirror

17:34.220 --> 17:36.387
that brings out
my natural beauty.

17:36.389 --> 17:39.190
I'm not sure
such a mirror exists.

17:39.192 --> 17:41.059
- Well, you better
find one.
- Uh...

17:41.061 --> 17:44.362
Oh, would you rather
be a spider or an earthworm?

17:44.364 --> 17:45.730
Neither.

17:45.732 --> 17:47.398
Do you have to boss
everyone around?

17:47.400 --> 17:49.901
How else am I supposed
to get what I want?

17:49.903 --> 17:52.303
- Now where is that troll?
- Right here, Grotta.

17:53.739 --> 17:56.674
You shouldn't sneak up
on people like that.

17:56.676 --> 17:57.842
That's my job.

17:57.844 --> 18:00.778
Now, where are
the crystals?

18:00.780 --> 18:02.747
On the ceiling
of the troll cave,

18:02.749 --> 18:04.115
where they belong.

18:04.117 --> 18:06.684
Yeah, you see,
one way or another,

18:06.686 --> 18:09.220
I am taking
those crystals.

18:09.222 --> 18:10.688
No, you're not.

18:10.690 --> 18:13.091
And who's going
to stop me?

18:13.093 --> 18:16.027
- You?
- No. Us.

18:16.029 --> 18:17.762
What... what's this?

18:17.764 --> 18:19.530
Where did those trolls
come from?

18:19.532 --> 18:21.699
Stay back.
Stay back!

18:21.701 --> 18:24.969
There's one thing you should
know about trolls, fliegel.

18:24.971 --> 18:26.871
We stick together.

18:26.873 --> 18:28.606
Get back.
I'm warning you.

18:30.776 --> 18:32.410
( screaming )

18:32.412 --> 18:34.412
The light.
( sobbing )

18:34.414 --> 18:36.814
Turn the light
back on.

18:36.816 --> 18:38.649
She's afraid
of the dark.

18:38.651 --> 18:39.917
Good thinking,
Gnarlie.

18:39.919 --> 18:41.786
( sobbing continues )
I'm sorry.

18:41.788 --> 18:44.722
I promise I'll leave
everyone alone.

18:44.724 --> 18:48.159
Just please make it
light again.

18:49.495 --> 18:51.395
Oh, thank goodness.

18:51.397 --> 18:53.464
Let Sofia go, Grotta.

18:53.466 --> 18:56.067
Okay, okay.

18:57.603 --> 18:59.871
Letlooseum.

19:01.840 --> 19:03.674
And Mr. Cedric.

19:03.676 --> 19:05.810
Turn him back
to normal.

19:05.812 --> 19:09.113
( sniffling ) Was he ever
really normal to begin with?

19:09.115 --> 19:11.983
You know what
she means, fliegel.

19:11.985 --> 19:14.785
Fine. Very well.

19:14.787 --> 19:17.021
Reverso.

19:21.593 --> 19:23.027
Don't, Mr. Cedric.

19:23.029 --> 19:24.762
Then we'll be
just as mean as her.

19:24.764 --> 19:26.464
Mark my words, fliegel.

19:26.466 --> 19:28.432
You haven't seen
the last of me.

19:29.668 --> 19:33.337
Why are troll doorways
so low?

19:33.339 --> 19:36.774
You weren't very nice
to my friend, Grotta.

19:36.776 --> 19:38.776
I think you owe him
an apology.

19:38.778 --> 19:40.778
I'm sorry.

19:40.780 --> 19:42.780
I'm just so scared
of the dark,

19:42.782 --> 19:45.516
I had to have
those cave crystals.

19:45.518 --> 19:47.685
Well, there are better ways
to get what you want

19:47.687 --> 19:48.786
than bossing people around.

19:48.788 --> 19:50.788
Really?

19:50.790 --> 19:52.390
Like what?

19:52.392 --> 19:53.991
Like asking them
nicely.

19:53.993 --> 19:56.694
She's right.
If you had just
asked us,

19:56.696 --> 19:58.696
we might have
given you some.

19:58.698 --> 20:01.699
But no one's ever
nice to me.

20:01.701 --> 20:03.834
Because you're not
nice to them.

20:03.836 --> 20:05.970
Oh. Okay.

20:05.972 --> 20:08.873
Well, here goes nothing.

20:08.875 --> 20:12.543
I know these caves
belong to you,

20:12.545 --> 20:15.880
but is it okay
if I stay here
and live in this one?

20:15.882 --> 20:17.715
You forgot
the magic word.

20:17.717 --> 20:20.484
- Abracadabra?
- Please.

20:20.486 --> 20:22.687
( sniffles )
Please.

20:22.689 --> 20:24.188
To tell you the truth,
Grotta,

20:24.190 --> 20:26.257
there's no way
you can stay here...

20:26.259 --> 20:28.759
without a little
more light.

20:28.761 --> 20:30.728
Here. You can have
my crystal.

20:30.730 --> 20:31.862
And mine.

20:31.864 --> 20:35.233
- And mine.
- And mine.

20:37.936 --> 20:39.837
Here.

20:41.373 --> 20:44.175
Huh? You're giving them
to me?

20:44.177 --> 20:46.077
Why?

20:46.079 --> 20:48.913
Because it's
the neighborly
thing to do,

20:48.915 --> 20:52.583
and it looks like
you're our new neighbor.

20:52.585 --> 20:56.687
( gasps )
I've never seen
so much light.

20:56.689 --> 20:58.289
I don't know
what to say.

20:58.291 --> 21:00.057
You could start with
thank you.

21:00.059 --> 21:02.593
Thank you.

21:03.762 --> 21:05.630
Uh, excuse me,

21:05.632 --> 21:07.798
but since you're
being nicer and everything,

21:07.800 --> 21:10.768
I wouldn't mind
getting turned back
to normal.

21:10.770 --> 21:13.571
I suppose you're
right, Flinch.

21:13.573 --> 21:14.939
Reverso!

21:19.745 --> 21:21.746
I thought you were
going to change him back.

21:21.748 --> 21:23.247
I am back.

21:23.249 --> 21:26.450
This is what I was
before she turned me
into a mole.

21:26.452 --> 21:29.820
Oh, well, in that case,
you look great.

21:29.822 --> 21:32.823
( giggling )
So cute.

21:32.825 --> 21:34.659
Uh-oh.

21:34.661 --> 21:36.560
Thanks for helping
me, Sofia.

21:36.562 --> 21:37.795
Any time, Gnarlie.

21:38.964 --> 21:41.932
Now how would
my new neighbors

21:41.934 --> 21:44.001
like to join me for
cave moss tea?

21:44.003 --> 21:46.237
Ooh, my favorite.

21:46.239 --> 21:48.439
- That would be marvelous.
- GROTTA: Wonderful.

21:48.441 --> 21:50.975
Then sit right down
and enjoy.

21:50.977 --> 21:52.576
Cave moss?

21:52.578 --> 21:54.912
It's tastier
than it sounds.
