02:56.001 --> 02:57.438
Adrian?

06:02.753 --> 06:03.928
Come on.

07:47.379 --> 07:49.164
Zeus, I'm sorry.

07:49.207 --> 07:50.992
I can't take you with me.

07:52.428 --> 07:54.474
I'm sorry.

07:56.911 --> 08:00.131
Shit. I'm not gonna leave you
with that thing on.

08:00.175 --> 08:01.437
Okay.

08:01.481 --> 08:02.394
Come here.

08:02.438 --> 08:03.657
It's okay. Good boy.

08:03.700 --> 08:05.093
There you go.

08:06.224 --> 08:07.661
Come here.

09:00.322 --> 09:02.454
Fuck.

09:02.498 --> 09:05.153
Emily, where are you?

09:07.024 --> 09:08.504
Shit.

09:57.684 --> 10:00.077
Cecilia, what is going on?

10:00.121 --> 10:01.339
-Are you okay?

10:02.471 --> 10:03.559
I'll explain later.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.300
Just go, Emily.

10:05.343 --> 10:06.780
Go.

10:06.823 --> 10:08.433
Open the fucking door, Cecilia!

10:08.477 --> 10:09.739
What is happening?

10:09.783 --> 10:11.045
Open the door!

10:11.088 --> 10:13.438
-No. -
-Open this door!

10:13.482 --> 10:15.179
-Open the door!

10:15.223 --> 10:17.617
-Open the fucking door!
-EMILY: I'm going, I'm going.

10:17.660 --> 10:19.706
Cecilia, get back here!

10:19.749 --> 10:22.622
EMILY:
Jesus!

10:22.665 --> 10:23.927
Get back here now!

10:23.971 --> 10:26.321
You can't do this!
Get back here!

11:22.420 --> 11:23.857
Cee.

11:25.902 --> 11:27.556
How long have you been up?

11:27.599 --> 11:28.818
A few hours.

11:28.862 --> 11:30.124
Can't sleep.

11:30.167 --> 11:32.300
Now, you know,
if you close your eyes

11:32.343 --> 11:35.172
and you lie down,
that usually helps.

11:38.523 --> 11:40.003
Um, don't think being tired

11:40.047 --> 11:42.136
gets you out of
our little deal, now.

11:42.179 --> 11:47.358
I swore to your sister I'd get
you to step outside my house.

11:47.402 --> 11:49.186
Hey, Cee.

11:50.448 --> 11:52.407
He's not out there.

11:52.450 --> 11:54.409
I promise.

12:47.114 --> 12:49.116
I'm sorry. I'm just...

12:52.206 --> 12:54.686
-I'm not ready yet.
-Hey, it's okay, Cee.

12:54.730 --> 12:57.602
That's the furthest you've gone
since you've been here, okay?

12:57.646 --> 13:00.562
So, as far as I'm concerned,
you just walked on the moon.

13:54.007 --> 13:55.356
Do I know you?

13:55.399 --> 13:57.575
-Do I owe you money?
-A lot.

13:57.619 --> 14:00.927
A lot? I told y'all about
running up on me in my house.

14:02.363 --> 14:04.234
-Hey. Cee.

14:04.278 --> 14:05.845
Tell her she can't
take you back.

14:05.888 --> 14:06.933
We're keeping you.

14:06.976 --> 14:10.327
What are you doing here, Emily?

14:10.371 --> 14:13.069
Well, it's nice
to see you, too, sis.

14:13.113 --> 14:15.767
JAMES: I'm gonna go see
what Sydney's up to.

14:15.811 --> 14:17.465
-Just...
-Mm.

14:17.508 --> 14:19.162
Yeah.

14:19.206 --> 14:21.338
This is not fair.

14:21.382 --> 14:23.558
I asked you not to come over.

14:23.601 --> 14:26.300
He knows where you live.
He will follow you.

14:26.343 --> 14:29.477
Yes, well, I have some news.

14:29.520 --> 14:31.261
There is no news
that justifies this.

14:31.305 --> 14:33.873
Okay, I have a plan,
and I just...

14:33.916 --> 14:35.962
I-I need you
to-to go along with it

14:36.005 --> 14:38.268
and just not be in control
for one second.

14:38.312 --> 14:40.880
I'm not trying
to control you, boo.

14:40.923 --> 14:42.925
I'm desperately trying
to tell you that

14:42.969 --> 14:45.319
you don't need
to cut me off anymore.

14:47.190 --> 14:49.584
Because he's dead.

14:52.674 --> 14:54.415
What?

15:05.556 --> 15:07.080
What?

15:22.834 --> 15:24.924
Hey.

15:25.837 --> 15:28.057
What did he do to you?

15:28.101 --> 15:30.320
Can you talk to me?

16:09.446 --> 16:12.754
CECILIA: It just doesn't make any sense.

16:14.016 --> 16:15.626
He was...
he was in... he was...

16:15.670 --> 16:19.108
in complete control of
everything, you know? Just...

16:20.501 --> 16:21.981
Including me.

16:22.024 --> 16:26.115
He controlled
how I looked and...

16:26.159 --> 16:29.466
what I wore and what I ate.

16:32.948 --> 16:35.690
And...

16:35.733 --> 16:40.042
then it was controlling
when I left the house and...

16:42.610 --> 16:44.568
...what I said.

16:44.612 --> 16:46.744
And eventually...

16:46.788 --> 16:48.703
what I thought.

16:52.620 --> 16:54.970
And if...

16:55.014 --> 16:59.322
if he didn't like what
he assumed I was thinking...

17:01.194 --> 17:04.153
...h-he... he would...

17:04.197 --> 17:06.025
JAMES:
He'd what? He'd...

17:06.938 --> 17:09.550
He would... he would hit you?

17:10.420 --> 17:12.553
Amongst other things.

17:13.902 --> 17:16.035
He wanted to have a baby.

17:16.078 --> 17:19.429
And I knew that if we did that,
that I...

17:19.473 --> 17:23.303
I would never be able
to get away from him, so...

17:23.346 --> 17:27.568
I took birth control
without him knowing it.

17:27.611 --> 17:32.616
But, um, that can only go on
for so long, so...

17:35.576 --> 17:37.795
I called you.

17:38.927 --> 17:41.060
Hey.

17:43.714 --> 17:45.629
You're here with us now.

17:46.978 --> 17:49.024
And you're safe.

17:49.068 --> 17:51.287
He's gone.

18:18.923 --> 18:20.577
I'm not telling you to aim low.

18:20.621 --> 18:23.145
I'm just saying, e-explore
more than one option, okay?

18:23.189 --> 18:24.407
Don't limit
your choices to just

18:24.451 --> 18:26.017
one school
in the whole country.

18:26.061 --> 18:28.150
But that one school is my goal.

18:28.194 --> 18:29.804
Parsons is my goal.

18:29.847 --> 18:33.460
Yeah, I told you
to have goals--plural.

18:35.549 --> 18:39.074
I think it's important
to have goals, James.

18:39.118 --> 18:40.380
Uh, hey.

18:41.729 --> 18:43.905
Look at you,
getting out into the world.

18:43.948 --> 18:46.864
You know, by next year, you'll
make it across the street.

18:51.173 --> 18:52.435
Uh, hey, Cee.

18:52.479 --> 18:54.220
-Hmm?
-Something came for you.

18:57.005 --> 18:58.920
No one knows I'm here.

19:10.714 --> 19:13.413
JAMES:
So, who's it from?

19:28.689 --> 19:31.387
Thank you both for coming in.

19:32.432 --> 19:34.477
As the appointed attorney

19:34.521 --> 19:37.567
representing my late brother's
discretionary trust,

19:37.611 --> 19:40.788
I'm required to enact
his final wishes.

19:40.831 --> 19:43.660
And he stipulated
that I do this in person.

19:43.704 --> 19:46.185
He wanted me to read a...
a prepared statement.

19:52.974 --> 19:55.455
"Cecilia,

19:55.498 --> 19:58.501
"although our relationship
was far from perfect,

19:58.545 --> 20:00.851
"I at least thought
we had built up enough trust

20:00.895 --> 20:02.070
"that you would talk to me

20:02.113 --> 20:03.724
"rather than running away
from what you

20:03.767 --> 20:05.204
-perceived us to have."
-No, no. Sorry.

20:05.247 --> 20:06.857
You're not allowed to do that.

20:06.901 --> 20:09.382
-I'm required to read this.
-She's not required to listen.

20:09.425 --> 20:11.862
E-mail me a copy,
and we will read it.

20:11.906 --> 20:13.299
You bet.

20:13.342 --> 20:14.691
I'm just trying to do my job.

20:14.735 --> 20:16.171
Your job is
to explain the money

20:16.215 --> 20:18.260
-you mentioned on the phone.
-I mentioned Cecilia

20:18.304 --> 20:20.262
specifically is named
in Adrian's trust.

20:20.306 --> 20:22.046
-That is why we're
sitting here. -Yes.

20:22.090 --> 20:24.310
For the same reason
so many women in Adrian's life

20:24.353 --> 20:26.486
got close to him: his money.

20:26.529 --> 20:28.531
If there was a chance of
physically being close to him,

20:28.575 --> 20:30.446
we would not be here
for any amount of money.

20:30.490 --> 20:32.318
You are physically
close to him.

20:34.320 --> 20:36.235
He's in that urn over there.

20:38.672 --> 20:44.199
And as per his final wishes,
you're getting $5 million,

20:44.243 --> 20:48.377
estate and income tax free.

20:48.421 --> 20:50.118
Now, the money
will be staggered

20:50.161 --> 20:51.902
in installments of $100,000

20:51.946 --> 20:54.601
each month for the next
four years or so,

20:54.644 --> 20:56.820
contingent, of course,
on the fine print.

20:56.864 --> 20:59.040
You can't commit a crime,
et cetera.

20:59.083 --> 21:02.435
Normally, I would have a
120-day contestability period,

21:02.478 --> 21:04.785
but I'm gonna waive my rights
in that regard.

21:04.828 --> 21:06.221
So...

21:06.265 --> 21:08.267
as soon as I have
your signature

21:08.310 --> 21:10.878
and your banking information,

21:10.921 --> 21:12.923
I can start
releasing the funds.

21:23.369 --> 21:25.327
CECILIA:
Okay, you can come in now.

21:30.680 --> 21:32.291
-Uh-oh.
-Oh, hey.

21:32.334 --> 21:34.031
-Wait, wait. Where you at?

21:34.075 --> 21:35.424
-Okay.
-Okay.

21:35.468 --> 21:37.513
-Can we look now?
-CECILIA: Careful.

21:37.557 --> 21:40.124
Yes, you can look.

21:40.168 --> 21:42.213
-Ta-da!
-Oh.

21:42.257 --> 21:44.259
Wow. Thanks, Cee.

21:44.303 --> 21:46.435
Wow, that's nice.
L-Look at that.

21:46.479 --> 21:48.350
-A ladder?

21:48.394 --> 21:49.482
JAMES:
Excuse you?

21:49.525 --> 21:51.527
I know I didn't hear you
just say that.

21:51.571 --> 21:53.834
-I meant to say thank you.
-What do you say? Uh-huh.

21:53.877 --> 21:56.532
You're welcome. Well, I-I knew
you needed a new one,

21:56.576 --> 21:58.665
and that one just...
that has to go.

21:58.708 --> 22:00.971
That's so nice of you, Cee.
Thank you so much.

22:01.015 --> 22:02.973
That's very sweet of you.
Thank you.

22:03.017 --> 22:05.062
I just...
I wanted to thank you for,

22:05.106 --> 22:06.499
you know, letting me stay here

22:06.542 --> 22:09.328
and for taking
such good care of me, so...

22:09.371 --> 22:13.810
And Sydney can also
use ladders.

22:13.854 --> 22:15.638
Don't think
I'm helping you paint.

22:15.682 --> 22:17.597
I wouldn't even bother
to ask you.

22:17.640 --> 22:19.555
No, not for, like,
painting, obviously,

22:19.599 --> 22:21.165
but just for a lot of things.

22:21.209 --> 22:24.081
You climb them to get things
like-like stuff like that.

22:24.125 --> 22:26.083
That's so strange.
God, I wish you had, like...

22:26.127 --> 22:27.302
Oh, wait, you could totally

22:27.346 --> 22:28.651
-use the ladder.
-A ladder to climb up...

22:28.695 --> 22:30.131
Yeah, the ladder's cool.

22:30.174 --> 22:31.828
-Okay. -This happened to just
pop up there by itself?

22:31.872 --> 22:33.352
-It happened to just
be here, so... -Mm-hmm.

22:33.395 --> 22:35.005
-CECILIA: ...it's convenient.
-Wow.

22:35.049 --> 22:36.137
What is it?

22:36.180 --> 22:37.617
-It has my name on it.
-That's weird.

22:37.660 --> 22:39.096
-And it looks like your
handwriting. -I don't know...

22:39.140 --> 22:41.055
-You sure it's weird?
-I just got a ladder, so...

22:41.098 --> 22:42.839
-If you think it's weird.
-I don't know what...

22:42.883 --> 22:44.145
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Let's see.

22:44.188 --> 22:45.929
-A cool ladder is all.

22:48.062 --> 22:50.717
It's a new bank account,
um, with your name on it,

22:50.760 --> 22:54.111
and I'm gonna put
$10,000 in it every month

22:54.155 --> 22:56.113
for the rest of the year.

22:56.157 --> 22:58.986
I called the account "Parsons."

23:03.947 --> 23:05.906
You're going to
fashion school, kid.

23:05.949 --> 23:08.038
Hey, whoa, Cee, Cee, that's...
that's too much, Cee.

23:08.082 --> 23:10.127
Come on, are you sure
you can do that?

23:10.171 --> 23:11.868
Let me put it this way.

23:11.912 --> 23:14.871
: She can probably
go to grad school, too.

23:14.915 --> 23:16.656
I'm going to Parsons.

23:16.699 --> 23:18.353
JAMES :
She can go to Parsons.

23:18.397 --> 23:19.789
CECILIA:
You're going to Parsons.

23:19.833 --> 23:21.443
-Oh, my God.

23:21.487 --> 23:22.923
Oh, wait, no.

23:22.966 --> 23:24.751
We got to cel...
we got to celebrate.

23:24.794 --> 23:27.406
And I don't want TV dinners,
microwave nothing, we...

23:27.449 --> 23:29.233
Oh, it's, like,
I guess too bad

23:29.277 --> 23:32.541
we don't have anything at all
to celebrate with.

23:32.585 --> 23:34.325
-Hey...!
-Whoo-whoo!

23:34.369 --> 23:36.545
- -JAMES: I don't
know why you dancing.

23:36.589 --> 23:38.417
You can't have none,
'cause you're not 21.

23:38.460 --> 23:40.201
-Yes, I can.
-CECILIA: Oh, come on.

23:40.244 --> 23:41.594
Just, like, a little bit.

23:41.637 --> 23:44.335
He said the other day that
I was mature for my age.

23:44.379 --> 23:45.467
-That's right.
-He did.

23:45.511 --> 23:46.773
-A mature child.
-I heard you say that.

23:46.816 --> 23:47.817
-I remember. -Hey,
hold up, hold up, hold up.

23:47.861 --> 23:49.079
This ain't fair, okay?
Two against one.

23:49.123 --> 23:50.472
I'm just an innocent man
trying to do right.

23:50.516 --> 23:51.517
Are you scared? Are you scared?

23:51.560 --> 23:52.779
This a... this is abuse.
I'm a cop.

23:52.822 --> 23:53.910
-Are you-you scared?
-You realize I'm a cop.

23:53.954 --> 23:55.738
-I got him, I got him.
-Hey, hey, hey.

23:57.914 --> 24:00.134
-I got him, Sydney! I got him!
-SYDNEY: No, he's got me!

24:02.658 --> 24:06.575
-Oh! I'll protect you!

25:30.572 --> 25:31.791
Morning.

25:31.834 --> 25:33.532
You want some breakfast?

25:33.575 --> 25:35.446
Nah, nah, I got to go.

25:35.490 --> 25:38.580
You know, I'm a little
hungover, believe it or not.

25:38.624 --> 25:40.887
Ugh. Me, too.

25:40.930 --> 25:43.846
Champagne does that to me
every time.

25:43.890 --> 25:45.761
-We're getting old, Cee.

25:45.805 --> 25:47.023
We old.

25:47.067 --> 25:48.677
These winter mornings
are killing me.

25:48.721 --> 25:50.505
All right, look,
I'm out of here.

25:50.549 --> 25:52.594
Um, I'll be back around 7:00.

25:52.638 --> 25:53.987
-Okay.
-All right?

25:54.030 --> 25:55.989
-Oh, uh, Cee.
-Hmm?

25:56.032 --> 25:57.860
You mind getting Sydney up?

25:57.904 --> 25:59.558
She's actually pretty excited,
thanks to you.

25:59.601 --> 26:02.648
She, uh... she might need
a little help staying focused.

26:02.691 --> 26:04.475
You got it.

26:13.659 --> 26:15.486
Syd, come on, girl.

26:15.530 --> 26:17.314
You're gonna be late.

26:42.252 --> 26:43.558
CECILIA:
Shit!

26:43.602 --> 26:45.168
Shit, shit.

26:45.212 --> 26:47.736
-Shit.  -SYDNEY:
No, no, no, no, no.

26:47.780 --> 26:49.608
No, don't use water. No.

26:49.651 --> 26:51.305
Excuse me. Sorry.

27:03.752 --> 27:06.494
-Oh.
-Wow.

27:08.496 --> 27:09.976
You did that.

27:10.019 --> 27:11.455
Yeah.

27:11.499 --> 27:12.979
You think we can salvage it?

27:13.022 --> 27:14.371
- No.
-No?

27:14.415 --> 27:16.809
No. Sorry.

28:22.222 --> 28:24.354
James?

34:41.209 --> 34:43.081
- James!

34:43.124 --> 34:45.213
James! James, James!

34:45.257 --> 34:46.432
Yeah, yeah, what?

34:46.475 --> 34:47.868
What-what happened?
What happened? What?

34:47.911 --> 34:49.304
I saw something right there.
They were right there.

34:49.348 --> 34:51.132
There were footprints.
I saw it.

34:51.176 --> 34:52.394
You-you saw...
you saw footprints?

34:52.438 --> 34:54.309
I saw... I... Yes, I saw...
On the sheets.

34:54.353 --> 34:56.050
I saw it right there.

34:56.094 --> 34:58.400
-I saw them.
-On the sheet?

34:58.444 --> 35:00.707
I saw it.

35:00.750 --> 35:04.058
There was someone in here.
There was someone in here.

35:04.102 --> 35:05.190
Syd, put that
stupid thing away.

35:05.233 --> 35:06.756
Y-You're the one
who bought it for me.

35:06.800 --> 35:08.410
Who you gonna spray? Who?

35:10.151 --> 35:12.240
James, I saw it.

35:13.198 --> 35:15.025
I swear.

35:15.069 --> 35:17.158
Hey, Cee.

35:19.247 --> 35:22.729
Adrian will haunt you
if you let him.

35:22.772 --> 35:24.557
Don't let him.

35:26.863 --> 35:29.475
Now, you should try
and get some sleep.

35:29.518 --> 35:31.912
You have an important
job interview tomorrow,

35:31.955 --> 35:34.262
and I don't want the memory
of this motherfu...

35:35.698 --> 35:37.961
...that...

35:38.005 --> 35:41.965
this person to ruin it.

35:42.009 --> 35:43.967
-Okay?
-Okay, yeah.

35:44.011 --> 35:45.708
-Sorry.
-Yeah.

35:53.629 --> 35:55.892
CECILIA: After Cal Poly,
I worked in Paris

35:55.936 --> 35:57.329
for six months.

35:57.372 --> 36:00.506
That was the best time
of my life, for sure.

36:00.549 --> 36:02.899
Except for this next phase,
of course.

36:02.943 --> 36:04.249
Take a seat.

36:07.339 --> 36:09.819
So, any reason you worked
in Paris in particular?

36:09.863 --> 36:11.952
Is that where all the
beautiful women in the world

36:11.995 --> 36:13.301
have to go as a rule?

36:14.955 --> 36:17.305
Well, I speak a little...
a little French,

36:17.349 --> 36:20.003
and I've always wanted
to live there.

36:20.047 --> 36:21.657
So, after I graduated,

36:21.701 --> 36:25.226
I went out there
on a totally student budget.

36:25.270 --> 36:27.489
I slept in a broom closet,
literally.

36:27.533 --> 36:30.362
I started this firm
in a supply closet, literally.

36:30.405 --> 36:32.320
There you go.

36:32.364 --> 36:34.670
-So we both know the value
of closet space. -Yeah.

36:37.978 --> 36:39.849
Let me see some of your work.

36:39.893 --> 36:41.721
Yes, of course.

36:53.863 --> 36:55.822
Uh, um...

36:57.563 --> 37:00.609
I don't...
Uh, I know that I...

37:03.090 --> 37:05.919
I know I put them in here,
so I... so I apologize.

37:05.962 --> 37:07.181
I don't know what happened.

37:07.225 --> 37:08.661
-Um...
-It's okay.

37:08.704 --> 37:11.794
Uh, you can send it to us
whenever you get a chance.

37:11.838 --> 37:13.013
Okay.

37:13.056 --> 37:15.581
Uh, so, uh,
l-let me tell you about us.

37:15.624 --> 37:19.280
Uh, at Ruler, we approach
architecture on a human level.

37:19.324 --> 37:20.977
First and...

37:22.892 --> 37:24.807
Are you okay?

37:26.766 --> 37:29.551
Um, I'm sorry.

37:29.595 --> 37:31.466
Uh, I'm just not feeling, um...

37:31.510 --> 37:34.252
Uh, would you like
some water or...

37:35.949 --> 37:37.472
Cecilia?

37:40.606 --> 37:43.304
Are you feeling okay?

38:01.104 --> 38:02.541
Cecilia.

38:02.584 --> 38:05.108
Okay, so, uh,
you probably shouldn't drive

38:05.152 --> 38:07.807
or operate any heavy machinery
for the next few days,

38:07.850 --> 38:10.853
but other than that,
you seem fine.

38:10.897 --> 38:13.726
Either myself or my admitting
will, uh, follow up with you

38:13.769 --> 38:15.423
with the results
of the blood test.

38:15.467 --> 38:18.034
Okay? Uh, can you just leave
a number with the nurse?

38:18.078 --> 38:19.906
You guys can go home.

38:19.949 --> 38:21.603
Okay.

38:23.823 --> 38:25.085
You ready?

38:25.128 --> 38:26.782
Yeah.

38:56.812 --> 38:57.813
Hello?

38:57.857 --> 38:59.380
DR. LEE:
Is Cecilia Kass there?

38:59.424 --> 39:00.686
That's me.

39:00.729 --> 39:04.429
Hi. Uh, this is Dr. Lee
at St. Vincent's.

39:04.472 --> 39:08.128
So, we got the results
of your blood test back,

39:08.171 --> 39:09.999
and it looks like the diazepam

39:10.043 --> 39:12.654
was the most likely cause
of you fainting.

39:12.698 --> 39:15.396
Um, sorry, what diazepam?

39:15.440 --> 39:18.921
Well, your blood work showed
a very high amount of it.

39:18.965 --> 39:22.534
That would definitely explain
what happened to you.

39:23.970 --> 39:27.190
There's something else
I wanted to talk to you about,

39:27.234 --> 39:32.065
but I'm not sure if we should
do it over the phone, so, um...

39:53.782 --> 39:55.741
CECILIA:
Tell him to stop.

39:55.784 --> 39:57.656
TOM:
Tell who to stop what?

39:57.699 --> 40:01.094
Tell him to stop
what he's doing.

40:01.137 --> 40:02.965
Do you know what
she's babbling about?

40:03.009 --> 40:05.185
Nah, she hasn't explained to me
why we're here yet,

40:05.228 --> 40:08.536
but being her very good friend,
I know it's a good reason,

40:08.580 --> 40:11.060
so I'm gonna need you
to sit up and listen.

40:11.104 --> 40:12.497
Show a little respect.

40:17.502 --> 40:20.809
One night, I was sitting,

40:20.853 --> 40:26.554
and I was thinking about
how to leave Adrian.

40:26.598 --> 40:30.297
I was planning
the whole thing in my mind.

40:30.340 --> 40:33.082
And he was staring at me,

40:33.126 --> 40:35.084
studying me.

40:36.869 --> 40:40.916
And without me saying
a single word,

40:40.960 --> 40:45.094
he said that I could
never leave him.

40:45.138 --> 40:47.532
That wherever I went,

40:47.575 --> 40:50.709
he would find me.

40:50.752 --> 40:53.929
That he would walk
right up to me

40:53.973 --> 40:57.542
and I wouldn't be able
to see him,

40:57.585 --> 41:00.501
but that he would
leave me a sign

41:00.545 --> 41:02.938
so that I'd know he was there.

41:10.816 --> 41:15.385
The night I left him,
I drugged him with that.

41:15.429 --> 41:17.953
I lost the bottle that night.

41:17.997 --> 41:21.783
And somehow,
it found its way back to me.

41:23.350 --> 41:25.265
So, what exactly
are you saying?

41:25.308 --> 41:28.790
You lost the bottle,
you found the bottle.

41:31.097 --> 41:33.055
He's not dead, Tom.

41:36.581 --> 41:38.844
I have a pile of ashes
in the box

41:38.887 --> 41:42.151
that would disagree
with you, Cecilia.

41:43.370 --> 41:45.503
I don't know how he's done it.

41:47.417 --> 41:49.681
He's figured it out, though.

41:51.683 --> 41:55.991
He has figured out a way
to be invisible.

42:00.213 --> 42:02.998
He is a world leader
in the field of optics.

42:03.042 --> 42:06.524
I-I... I know that he
could do this.

42:09.222 --> 42:12.312
Something tells me you know
exactly what I'm talking about.

42:15.097 --> 42:17.186
He's not dead.

42:19.798 --> 42:22.322
I just can't see him.

42:22.365 --> 42:24.759
Please tell him to stop.

42:28.241 --> 42:29.590
Okay.

42:29.634 --> 42:32.201
No, I agree with you.

42:32.245 --> 42:33.594
Adrian was brilliant.

42:33.638 --> 42:35.683
But it wasn't because of
anything he invented.

42:35.727 --> 42:37.903
It was how he got
in people's heads.

42:37.946 --> 42:41.559
That was his true genius--
knowing people's weaknesses.

42:42.603 --> 42:44.170
You think about it.

42:44.213 --> 42:48.566
He came up with the perfect way
to torture you even in death.

42:48.609 --> 42:50.132
Only thing more brilliant

42:50.176 --> 42:52.134
than inventing something
that makes you invisible

42:52.178 --> 42:55.224
is not inventing it
but making you think he did.

42:56.922 --> 42:58.880
My brother controlled me

42:58.924 --> 43:01.230
long before he met you,
Cecilia.

43:01.274 --> 43:03.058
I hated him.

43:03.102 --> 43:05.757
You and I,
we got that in common.

43:09.761 --> 43:12.328
I was relieved...

43:14.504 --> 43:16.942
...when I heard
that he was dead.

43:24.732 --> 43:26.691
He's gone, Cecilia.

43:26.734 --> 43:28.649
I saw his body.

43:30.259 --> 43:32.131
Listen to me.

43:34.089 --> 43:37.789
Don't let him win
by bringing him back to life.

44:07.514 --> 44:08.689
Hey.

44:09.647 --> 44:11.866
Hey.

44:12.824 --> 44:14.782
Emily, I need to talk to you.

44:14.826 --> 44:17.306
Well, at least now
we have clarity.

44:17.350 --> 44:19.700
Now I know what
you really think of me.

44:19.744 --> 44:21.789
-What?
-Thanks so much

44:21.833 --> 44:24.357
for carving out the time
to let me know how--

44:24.400 --> 44:28.796
quote, unquote--
"suffocating" I am to you.

44:28.840 --> 44:30.058
What? What are you...

44:30.102 --> 44:31.930
Not that I should
have to say this,

44:31.973 --> 44:34.672
but I never expected
any of that money.

44:37.283 --> 44:39.851
Emily, I-I don't... I don't
know what you're talking about.

44:41.200 --> 44:43.724
The e-mail-- the e-mail
you sent me this morning.

44:43.768 --> 44:45.334
-What e-mail? -If that's
how you feel about me,

44:45.378 --> 44:48.294
don't ask me to bail you out
of your personal life anymore.

44:48.337 --> 44:50.992
If you're too stupid to know
who the good guys are

44:51.036 --> 44:54.126
and too weak to get away
from the bad ones,

44:54.169 --> 44:56.345
don't sob to me for charity.

44:56.389 --> 44:57.520
I'm out.

44:57.564 --> 44:59.827
I didn't send you
the fucking e-mail.

45:00.741 --> 45:01.873
I didn't.

45:01.916 --> 45:06.094
Someone is-is-is
doing this to me.

45:06.138 --> 45:09.750
He's-he's doing this to me.

45:09.794 --> 45:11.404
Who's...

45:13.319 --> 45:14.973
Adrian?

45:17.323 --> 45:20.369
Adrian sent me the e-mail.
Okay.

45:23.416 --> 45:26.593
You need some medication.
Adrian is dead.

45:26.636 --> 45:29.552
-Em, please, no.

46:47.717 --> 46:49.807
Cee?

47:04.909 --> 47:07.041
It's okay, Syd.

47:07.085 --> 47:10.218
You-you know what
I think we need?

47:10.262 --> 47:11.480
Um...

47:11.524 --> 47:14.092
I think we could
kick Dad out and...

47:15.876 --> 47:17.704
...have a little girls' night.

47:17.747 --> 47:19.314
Eat some cake.

47:26.713 --> 47:28.671
Yeah.

47:28.715 --> 47:30.412
I do like cake.

47:35.940 --> 47:38.507
Oh, my God.
Sydney, are you okay?

47:38.551 --> 47:40.683
Why would you just...
Stop! Stop! Dad!

47:40.727 --> 47:42.642
-What? No. No, Sydney,
I didn't... -Dad! Dad.

47:42.685 --> 47:44.209
-JAMES: What? What-what...
-No, I... -Dad, she...

47:44.252 --> 47:46.167
-What happened? What happened?
-She-she hit me.

47:46.211 --> 47:48.082
-JAMES: What?
-No. No, no, no.

47:48.126 --> 47:49.518
James, I did not do that.

47:49.562 --> 47:51.781
Sydney, I would never hit you.
I love you.

47:51.825 --> 47:53.044
I would never do that, James.

47:53.087 --> 47:55.046
It was him.
He's here, I swear to you.

47:55.089 --> 47:56.743
Enough. Enough.

47:56.786 --> 47:58.136
Cee, enough.

47:58.179 --> 48:00.355
Just stop it.
Are you okay, baby?

48:00.399 --> 48:01.748
-I don't want to stay here.
-You-you all right?

48:01.791 --> 48:02.967
Sydney, I'm sorry.
I would never...

48:03.010 --> 48:05.012
Hey, hey. Cee.

48:05.056 --> 48:08.059
Right now my priority is
getting my baby somewhere safe.

48:08.102 --> 48:09.712
Do you understand?

48:09.756 --> 48:11.192
Come on, baby. It's okay.

48:11.236 --> 48:13.542
CECILIA:
No. James, please.

48:13.586 --> 48:14.935
This is what he wants.

48:14.979 --> 48:16.632
This is what he used to do
when we were together.

48:16.676 --> 48:18.939
He wants you to think
that I did it.

48:18.983 --> 48:20.549
This is what he does.
He tries to isolate me,

48:20.593 --> 48:22.812
-and he tries to get me alone.
-Hey!

48:22.856 --> 48:24.118
You need to calm down.

48:24.162 --> 48:26.077
You are scaring my daughter.

48:26.120 --> 48:29.123
Now, if I were you, I would go
to your sister's place.

48:29.167 --> 48:31.604
You don't need
to be here right now.

48:34.041 --> 48:35.782
Come on, Sydney.

48:35.825 --> 48:38.089
Sydney, Sydney, I'm sorry.
Sydney.

48:52.930 --> 48:55.019
Where are you?

48:55.976 --> 48:57.108
Come on!

49:01.025 --> 49:03.810
Where are you? Come on out.

49:03.853 --> 49:05.377
Don't hit a little girl.

49:05.420 --> 49:07.335
Hit me!

50:02.086 --> 50:04.566
So, why me, Adrian?

50:09.876 --> 50:13.010
You could have any woman
you wanted.

50:17.057 --> 50:18.972
That's the sad reality.

50:19.016 --> 50:20.321
Right?

50:20.365 --> 50:24.586
And that's what money
and power buy you.

50:25.805 --> 50:27.372
People.

50:32.029 --> 50:35.380
So...

50:35.423 --> 50:37.295
why me?

50:39.471 --> 50:43.562
I'm just a suburban girl who...

50:43.605 --> 50:46.869
stumbled into your life
one night at a party.

50:52.353 --> 50:56.140
Can't you just forget
I ever existed?

51:01.841 --> 51:04.626
There's nothing left

51:04.670 --> 51:06.802
for you to take.

51:13.983 --> 51:16.725
You've already taken it all.

52:36.718 --> 52:38.329
ADRIAN :
This is Adrian Griffin.

52:38.372 --> 52:39.547
Please leave a message,

52:39.591 --> 52:41.897
and I'll get back to you
when I can.

59:10.198 --> 59:12.331
No!

1:00:48.819 --> 1:00:51.648
-Cecilia?
-Yes. Go.

1:00:51.691 --> 1:00:53.693
Please, hurry. Lock the doors.

1:00:53.737 --> 1:00:54.999
-Lock the doors!
-You okay?

1:00:55.042 --> 1:00:56.304
Yes.
Please, please just go.

1:00:56.348 --> 1:00:57.436
Okay.

1:01:03.877 --> 1:01:05.966
Just please hurry, please.

1:01:10.841 --> 1:01:14.192
Stinson Beach--
that's a long way from here.

1:01:57.931 --> 1:02:01.021
CECILIA:
I-I just need to get something.

1:02:01.065 --> 1:02:02.719
Do you mind waiting for me?

1:02:02.762 --> 1:02:04.068
I might be two minutes,

1:02:04.111 --> 1:02:06.810
I might be 20,
I don't know, but...

1:02:06.853 --> 1:02:08.942
You could run me back
to the city after.

1:02:08.986 --> 1:02:10.378
-Sure.
-Okay.

1:02:10.422 --> 1:02:12.032
No problem.

1:03:08.480 --> 1:03:10.787
-Zeus.

1:03:10.830 --> 1:03:14.312
Hi. Hi.

1:04:13.545 --> 1:04:17.201
12-14... 17.

1:04:19.029 --> 1:04:20.900
The day we met.

1:04:33.391 --> 1:04:35.393
So romantic.

1:08:34.414 --> 1:08:36.938
Please, meet me tonight,
if you can,

1:08:36.982 --> 1:08:38.418
in a pu... in a public place.

1:08:38.462 --> 1:08:40.420
8:00 at Yulan.

1:08:40.464 --> 1:08:43.249
And if you can't, I understand,
but you have to tell me,

1:08:43.293 --> 1:08:44.859
because I have to call
someone else,

1:08:44.903 --> 1:08:47.297
because I don't think
I have much time left.

1:08:49.429 --> 1:08:52.606
Thank you. Thank you.

1:09:35.214 --> 1:09:37.782
Hi.

1:09:37.825 --> 1:09:39.218
Hey.

1:09:39.262 --> 1:09:41.699
WAITER:
Hey, guys. Welcome to Yulan.

1:09:41.742 --> 1:09:43.309
My name is Taylor,
and I will be

1:09:43.353 --> 1:09:44.658
taking care of you
this evening.

1:09:44.702 --> 1:09:45.920
Do you know
how this place works?

1:09:45.964 --> 1:09:47.400
I'm assuming you order food,
then you eat it.

1:09:47.444 --> 1:09:48.706
Hmm, pretty much.

1:09:48.749 --> 1:09:51.187
We just do things
a little bit differently.

1:09:51.230 --> 1:09:52.318
It's all family style.

1:09:52.362 --> 1:09:53.754
We've been here before.
It's all good.

1:09:53.798 --> 1:09:55.495
TAYLOR: Okay. Can I get you
started with some water?

1:09:55.539 --> 1:09:57.193
-We have still or sparkling.
-Just the free kind.

1:09:57.236 --> 1:09:59.630
-: Okay, tap it is.
-Cool.

1:10:02.372 --> 1:10:04.983
Thank you for being here.

1:10:08.160 --> 1:10:10.249
I love you.

1:10:12.208 --> 1:10:14.297
You're like a cop, Emily,

1:10:14.340 --> 1:10:17.082
and y-you have
this brute-force strength

1:10:17.125 --> 1:10:22.653
that is so, so comforting
when I'm in trouble,

1:10:22.696 --> 1:10:27.440
and it is really intimidating
when I'm not.

1:10:27.484 --> 1:10:30.313
I mean, James actually is
a six-foot cop,

1:10:30.356 --> 1:10:33.185
and he's, I think,
really intimidated by you.

1:10:33.229 --> 1:10:34.360
As he should be.

1:10:34.404 --> 1:10:35.753
I'd kick his ass.

1:10:37.581 --> 1:10:38.538
I would.

1:10:38.582 --> 1:10:41.324
You would.

1:10:42.934 --> 1:10:47.808
I need that strength
in my life right now.

1:10:47.852 --> 1:10:51.899
And I need you to believe
what I'm about to tell you.

1:10:54.772 --> 1:10:56.904
Okay. I...

1:11:01.474 --> 1:11:03.433
Thank you, Taylor.

1:11:06.131 --> 1:11:08.394
TAYLOR: All right.
Uh, do you guys need more time

1:11:08.438 --> 1:11:09.917
-with the drink menu?
-Yes.

1:11:09.961 --> 1:11:11.397
Lots more time.

1:11:11.441 --> 1:11:14.444
TAYLOR :
Okay, no problem at all.

1:11:16.402 --> 1:11:18.622
Emily.

1:11:21.581 --> 1:11:24.236
I went to his house today.

1:11:24.280 --> 1:11:26.630
-You went to Adrian's house?
-Yes.

1:11:27.631 --> 1:11:29.633
I just walked right in.

1:11:29.676 --> 1:11:34.072
I found something that can
prove what I'm experiencing.

1:11:34.115 --> 1:11:39.947
That can prove that Adrian
is stalking me.

1:11:39.991 --> 1:11:41.949
What is it?

1:11:41.993 --> 1:11:45.605
It's some kind of suit
that Adrian has built.

1:11:45.649 --> 1:11:49.000
And it has cameras,
and it somehow...

1:11:49.043 --> 1:11:50.610
What?

1:13:03.553 --> 1:13:04.989
CECILIA:
No, please. No!

1:13:05.032 --> 1:13:07.426
You can't do this.
You can't do this.

1:13:07.470 --> 1:13:09.036
He killed her. He killed her.

1:13:09.080 --> 1:13:10.864
Please, I didn't do it!

1:13:10.908 --> 1:13:12.170
I didn't do it.

1:13:12.213 --> 1:13:15.086
No! No!

1:13:15.129 --> 1:13:16.609
He killed her!

1:13:16.653 --> 1:13:18.698
He did it!
You have to listen to me.

1:13:18.742 --> 1:13:21.005
-Please, please, no.
-DOCTOR: Try to relax.

1:13:21.048 --> 1:13:22.485
Please, no!

1:13:22.528 --> 1:13:25.139
No!

1:13:25.183 --> 1:13:28.621
Listen to me! No!

1:13:28.665 --> 1:13:31.058
You motherfucker!

1:13:33.234 --> 1:13:34.714
You killed her!

1:13:34.758 --> 1:13:38.196
I see you! I see you!

1:13:38.239 --> 1:13:39.327
He's here!

1:13:39.371 --> 1:13:41.112
He's here. He's right here.

1:13:41.155 --> 1:13:42.505
He's right here. Please!

1:13:42.548 --> 1:13:45.333
You can't see him.
He's in the room.

1:13:45.377 --> 1:13:47.248
You have to listen to me.

1:13:47.292 --> 1:13:49.990
: He's right there.
He's gonna hurt me.

1:13:50.034 --> 1:13:52.689
-Please. No...
-DOCTOR: Okay.

1:13:52.732 --> 1:13:54.734
He's right there.

1:13:54.778 --> 1:13:56.997
-He's here.
-Okay.

1:13:57.041 --> 1:13:58.608
He's right...

1:13:58.651 --> 1:14:01.132
DOCTOR:
There.

1:14:05.223 --> 1:14:07.312
-Everything's better now.
-: He's right there.

1:14:07.355 --> 1:14:09.967
DOCTOR:
Okay? You'll be all right.

1:14:41.607 --> 1:14:43.566
ADRIAN:
Surprise.

1:14:54.533 --> 1:14:57.144
DETECTIVE RECKLEY:
Cecilia.

1:14:57.188 --> 1:15:00.017
Can you confirm the person
in this video is you?

1:15:03.673 --> 1:15:05.022
And can you confirm

1:15:05.065 --> 1:15:07.154
you recently fainted
during a job interview

1:15:07.198 --> 1:15:10.506
due to a high amount
of diazepam in your system?

1:15:16.599 --> 1:15:19.297
-I was drugged.
-RECKLEY: Uh-huh.

1:15:21.125 --> 1:15:23.997
You also sent your sister
an e-mail a few days ago

1:15:24.041 --> 1:15:27.044
saying you wished
she was dead, didn't you?

1:15:36.749 --> 1:15:39.056
I have something.

1:15:40.623 --> 1:15:43.147
I have something
that will prove he's alive.

1:15:44.235 --> 1:15:46.324
I found it.

1:15:46.367 --> 1:15:48.805
What do you have?

1:15:58.510 --> 1:16:03.036
I can't tell you right now.

1:16:03.080 --> 1:16:05.561
He's listening.

1:16:07.693 --> 1:16:09.913
He's in the room, James.

1:16:09.956 --> 1:16:12.350
You're saying that the person
who killed your sister

1:16:12.393 --> 1:16:16.223
is in the room right now
but we can't see him?

1:16:18.356 --> 1:16:19.966
Okay.

1:16:20.010 --> 1:16:22.578
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

1:16:25.015 --> 1:16:27.670
-James.

1:16:29.062 --> 1:16:32.631
Tell me you don't think
I did this.

1:16:32.675 --> 1:16:35.112
Tell me you know that.

1:16:44.295 --> 1:16:47.298
I may as well
have done it, though.

1:16:52.825 --> 1:16:56.220
I brought Adrian into her life.

1:16:59.484 --> 1:17:01.399
I did that.

1:17:03.053 --> 1:17:06.360
I shouldn't have walked out
on you and left you alone.

1:17:08.711 --> 1:17:10.930
I failed you.

1:17:23.987 --> 1:17:28.034
NURSE: Is this bed giving you
any problems, Cecilia?

1:17:28.078 --> 1:17:29.949
No.

1:17:29.993 --> 1:17:34.258
Is there anything in the room
that is distressing to you?

1:17:38.697 --> 1:17:40.177
No.

1:17:41.526 --> 1:17:43.136
Okay. Good.

1:17:44.703 --> 1:17:47.967
I wanted to talk to you
about something.

1:17:48.011 --> 1:17:50.100
We checked the blood test

1:17:50.143 --> 1:17:52.363
that you had done
at the hospital last week.

1:17:52.406 --> 1:17:55.279
Do you remember taking
those blood tests?

1:17:55.322 --> 1:17:56.933
Yes.

1:17:59.283 --> 1:18:01.851
Okay.

1:18:01.894 --> 1:18:05.332
Well, did you know
that you were pregnant?

1:18:28.051 --> 1:18:30.531
No.

1:18:30.575 --> 1:18:34.448
Didn't the doctor
who took the test tell you?

1:18:35.580 --> 1:18:36.886
No, that can't be right.

1:18:36.929 --> 1:18:39.845
That's... that's not true.

1:18:39.889 --> 1:18:42.935
The test shows us
that it was pretty recent.

1:18:42.979 --> 1:18:45.198
We can't be sure
of exactly when,

1:18:45.242 --> 1:18:48.724
but it must have been
sometime in the last month.

1:18:53.424 --> 1:18:57.384
Sweetie, is there
anyone we can call?

1:18:59.256 --> 1:19:00.997
Family?

1:19:02.868 --> 1:19:04.957
Any friends?

1:19:06.480 --> 1:19:07.917
Okay.

1:19:44.301 --> 1:19:47.478
TOM: It's upsetting to see you
in this condition.

1:19:49.219 --> 1:19:52.048
Even though things ended badly
for you and Adrian,

1:19:52.091 --> 1:19:54.354
I still look at you as family.

1:19:56.748 --> 1:19:59.838
Are you my lawyer now?

1:19:59.882 --> 1:20:03.102
I'm the lawyer
for your source of income.

1:20:03.146 --> 1:20:06.802
I represent my brother's trust.

1:20:06.845 --> 1:20:09.500
The money from his trust
was payable to you

1:20:09.543 --> 1:20:11.502
conditional upon you
being subject

1:20:11.545 --> 1:20:14.287
to criminal charges of any kind

1:20:14.331 --> 1:20:17.160
or being ruled to be
mentally incompetent.

1:20:17.203 --> 1:20:20.728
Now, in light of
your current situation,

1:20:20.772 --> 1:20:22.905
it's my duty to inform you

1:20:22.948 --> 1:20:26.952
that any further payments
are to be halted.

1:20:26.996 --> 1:20:28.954
I know that you set up
a bank account

1:20:28.998 --> 1:20:31.130
for a friend of yours
to go to college,

1:20:31.174 --> 1:20:35.831
so I take no pleasure
in relaying that.

1:20:39.008 --> 1:20:41.837
I used to feel sorry for you.

1:20:43.055 --> 1:20:48.495
The blood relative
of a narcissist sociopath.

1:20:48.539 --> 1:20:51.672
Permanent punching bag.

1:20:51.716 --> 1:20:53.849
Handcuffed to his wallet.

1:20:55.372 --> 1:20:57.156
But now...

1:20:57.200 --> 1:21:01.378
I can see you
for what you really are.

1:21:03.554 --> 1:21:09.081
You're just the jellyfish
version of him.

1:21:12.911 --> 1:21:16.872
Everything but the spine.

1:21:18.917 --> 1:21:21.964
I mean, you can try
to litigate it,

1:21:22.007 --> 1:21:24.183
but that's going to be
an expensive option.

1:21:24.227 --> 1:21:26.229
I can't see it working.

1:21:30.407 --> 1:21:32.278
However...

1:21:36.065 --> 1:21:38.197
...if you sign this document
and forfeit

1:21:38.241 --> 1:21:40.634
your share of the trust,

1:21:40.678 --> 1:21:42.593
it'll be a lot cleaner.

1:21:54.039 --> 1:21:57.608
Or there's one option

1:21:57.651 --> 1:22:00.176
where this all goes away.

1:22:02.134 --> 1:22:04.658
Agree to have the baby...

1:22:07.661 --> 1:22:09.968
...and go back to him.

1:22:11.404 --> 1:22:13.232
You really think
he didn't know

1:22:13.276 --> 1:22:16.453
you were secretly using
birth control?

1:22:16.496 --> 1:22:18.107
Of course he did.

1:22:19.282 --> 1:22:20.979
You should have known
he'd find out.

1:22:21.023 --> 1:22:23.242
You knew him as well as I did.

1:22:26.637 --> 1:22:29.509
He replaced them
with something else.

1:22:29.553 --> 1:22:32.730
You only thought you were
taking birth control pills.

1:22:34.601 --> 1:22:39.258
He was always going to find you
no matter what he had to do.

1:22:39.302 --> 1:22:42.827
He needs you
because you don't need him.

1:22:42.870 --> 1:22:45.308
No one's ever left him before.

1:22:45.351 --> 1:22:48.441
But he's punished you
enough now.

1:22:48.485 --> 1:22:52.271
Now that he knows you're
the mother of his child.

1:22:52.315 --> 1:22:54.447
It's time to stop
playing games.

1:22:57.102 --> 1:23:00.627
A new life with him
can be given to you

1:23:00.671 --> 1:23:04.631
with one phone call.

1:23:04.675 --> 1:23:07.808
A life just like
your old one with Adrian.

1:23:07.852 --> 1:23:11.464
Cecilia, you don't really have
the choice right now.

1:23:11.508 --> 1:23:14.641
Right now you're a murderer.

1:23:16.252 --> 1:23:18.384
But I can change that.

1:23:34.922 --> 1:23:37.316
Adrian killed my sister,

1:23:37.360 --> 1:23:39.710
and you helped him.

1:23:45.020 --> 1:23:48.371
I don't expect you to make
a decision right now.

1:23:52.114 --> 1:23:54.725
I can come back in three days.

1:23:59.208 --> 1:24:01.166
Be good to yourself until then.

1:24:01.210 --> 1:24:03.342
We'll be watching.

1:24:08.652 --> 1:24:10.175
REPORTER:
Grab your umbrella.

1:24:10.219 --> 1:24:11.959
Grab your rain jacket.
Grab your rain boots.

1:24:12.003 --> 1:24:13.178
You're gonna need it.

1:24:13.222 --> 1:24:15.050
You'll need them
for a couple days.

1:24:15.093 --> 1:24:16.703
This pattern we're in
stays put.

1:24:16.747 --> 1:24:18.575
We've got this
atmospheric river

1:24:18.618 --> 1:24:21.273
pointed right here
at central California.

1:24:21.317 --> 1:24:24.189
And that means we're gonna
keep it cloudy and rainy

1:24:24.233 --> 1:24:26.191
as we get through
the rest of the week.

1:24:26.235 --> 1:24:28.106
This is a lot
of moisture coming in.

1:24:28.150 --> 1:24:29.803
It's going to mean
heavy rainfall

1:24:29.847 --> 1:24:31.196
and flash flooding concerns

1:24:31.240 --> 1:24:33.459
right as we get to
the end of the week.

1:24:33.503 --> 1:24:35.374
It's not until the weekend
that we get our next chance

1:24:35.418 --> 1:24:37.550
of seeing some dry conditions.

1:24:37.594 --> 1:24:39.335
In fact, the next glimpse
of sunshine even

1:24:39.378 --> 1:24:41.337
doesn't come
until Sunday afternoon

1:24:41.380 --> 1:24:42.599
when temperatures hit
the mid-60s.

1:24:42.642 --> 1:24:44.253
But until then,
it's going to be cool,

1:24:44.296 --> 1:24:46.603
it's going to be damp,
it's going to be...

1:25:07.754 --> 1:25:09.930
Open your mouth.

1:25:09.974 --> 1:25:12.107
Tongue up.

1:25:12.150 --> 1:25:14.283
Tongue down.

1:25:14.326 --> 1:25:16.850
Okay. Good night.

1:26:31.055 --> 1:26:33.188
You won't get the baby.

1:26:35.059 --> 1:26:37.192
And you won't get me.

1:26:46.244 --> 1:26:47.767
There you are.

1:26:55.079 --> 1:26:57.951
Fuck you!

1:27:04.088 --> 1:27:06.264
Get back in bed. Now.

1:27:37.077 --> 1:27:39.254
GUARD:
Hey!

1:27:39.297 --> 1:27:40.907
No! No!

1:27:40.951 --> 1:27:42.561
Please, no!

1:27:42.605 --> 1:27:43.910
No!

1:27:43.954 --> 1:27:46.870
Stop. Stop.

1:27:46.913 --> 1:27:48.567
No, please. No.

1:27:48.611 --> 1:27:52.354
No, stop! No, stop.

1:27:52.397 --> 1:27:53.833
He's right there.

1:28:16.856 --> 1:28:18.249
Lay down.

1:28:18.293 --> 1:28:19.903
CECILIA:
He's right there.

1:28:19.946 --> 1:28:21.600
Lay down.

1:28:21.644 --> 1:28:23.472
He's right behind you.

1:28:23.515 --> 1:28:25.169
-Listen to me.
-Who is?

1:28:25.212 --> 1:28:27.302
He's right behind you.

1:28:27.345 --> 1:28:29.304
-Turn around.
-I understand, Cecilia.

1:28:29.347 --> 1:28:31.523
-He's right there.
-Lay down.

1:28:31.567 --> 1:28:33.438
Listen to me!

1:28:33.482 --> 1:28:35.788
-He's right behind you.
-Stay down.

1:29:19.876 --> 1:29:22.400
-ADRIAN: Bang.

1:30:17.412 --> 1:30:19.022
-Get back!
-Hey! Hey, whoa. -Okay.

1:30:19.065 --> 1:30:21.024
Get back!

1:31:19.517 --> 1:31:21.867
GUARD:
She's over here!

1:31:21.911 --> 1:31:24.783
She's over there!
Go right!

1:32:39.379 --> 1:32:41.686
ADRIAN: You think you're
learning how to beat me,

1:32:41.730 --> 1:32:44.515
so I'm gonna truly
teach you something.

1:32:44.559 --> 1:32:46.822
If you fight me,
I won't ever hurt you.

1:32:46.865 --> 1:32:49.433
I'll find someone you love
and hurt them instead.

1:32:51.217 --> 1:32:52.915
Now you've only got
yourself to blame

1:32:52.958 --> 1:32:54.699
for that innocent
young girl's death.

1:32:54.743 --> 1:32:56.179
No, please.

1:32:56.222 --> 1:32:58.442
Not Sydney. Adrian, no.

1:32:58.485 --> 1:32:59.878
Hold it!

1:32:59.922 --> 1:33:01.140
Show me your hands!

1:33:35.174 --> 1:33:36.959
GUARD:
Hey!

1:33:42.138 --> 1:33:45.010
Cecilia, don't do
anything stupid.

1:33:47.143 --> 1:33:49.188
GUARD:
I'm over here!

1:33:49.232 --> 1:33:50.668
Hey, stop her!

1:33:51.626 --> 1:33:53.628
Heading towards the main exit!

1:34:25.660 --> 1:34:28.184
What the... What the fuck?

1:34:30.099 --> 1:34:33.189
WOMAN :
Hello? Hello?

1:34:34.320 --> 1:34:35.234
Hey!

1:34:35.278 --> 1:34:36.714
WOMAN:
Harry, what's going on?

1:34:36.758 --> 1:34:38.107
Harry.

1:34:38.150 --> 1:34:39.325
Hey!

1:34:39.369 --> 1:34:40.500
WOMAN:
Hello?

1:34:40.544 --> 1:34:41.806
Harry, are you okay?

1:34:41.850 --> 1:34:43.155
-He's fine. He's fine.
-What?

1:34:43.199 --> 1:34:45.288
-I promise.
-Who... who is this?

1:34:57.300 --> 1:34:59.171
JAMES :
This is James Lanier.

1:34:59.215 --> 1:35:00.564
James, it's me.

1:35:00.607 --> 1:35:02.044
JAMES:
Cee? What... How...

1:35:02.087 --> 1:35:04.089
-How are you calling?
-It doesn't matter about that.

1:35:04.133 --> 1:35:06.570
-You have to listen to me.
-No, no, it-it does matter.

1:35:06.613 --> 1:35:07.832
-Listen...
-Come on! -

1:35:09.878 --> 1:35:11.009
You can't be calling me.

1:35:11.053 --> 1:35:12.097
-James, listen to me!
-Look, I...

1:35:12.141 --> 1:35:13.403
Sydney's life is in danger.

1:35:13.446 --> 1:35:14.621
Where are you right now?

1:35:14.665 --> 1:35:15.840
I'm at work.
She's at the house.

1:35:17.276 --> 1:35:19.365
Okay, you need to go to her
right now, James.

1:35:19.409 --> 1:35:20.845
Do you hear me?

1:35:20.889 --> 1:35:23.326
'Cause I'm afraid Adrian
is gonna do something to her.

1:37:19.703 --> 1:37:22.358
Sydney.

1:37:23.881 --> 1:37:25.404
Sydney.

1:37:26.971 --> 1:37:28.712
-Syd, you okay?

1:37:28.755 --> 1:37:29.931
-Sydney, Syd...

1:37:54.564 --> 1:37:57.088
Stop!

1:37:57.132 --> 1:37:58.742
-SYDNEY: No!

1:38:01.788 --> 1:38:04.182
Stop!

1:38:07.098 --> 1:38:08.752
Stop.

1:38:10.319 --> 1:38:11.668
Dad! Dad!

1:38:12.799 --> 1:38:14.366
No!

1:38:23.158 --> 1:38:24.333
Sydney, get down!

1:39:05.069 --> 1:39:07.637
-Don't cry.

1:39:17.777 --> 1:39:19.736
Tom?

1:40:09.264 --> 1:40:11.483
ADRIAN :
Is someone there?

1:40:11.527 --> 1:40:14.486
Help. Help.

1:40:14.530 --> 1:40:15.879
Please.

1:40:15.922 --> 1:40:17.663
-Help!
-Stand clear!

1:40:22.059 --> 1:40:24.018
Police! Show me your hands.

1:40:24.061 --> 1:40:25.758
JAMES:
Our tactical team

1:40:25.802 --> 1:40:27.151
found Adrian this morning

1:40:27.195 --> 1:40:30.328
tied up in his basement.

1:40:30.372 --> 1:40:32.069
Looks like he was
a victim of his brother

1:40:32.113 --> 1:40:34.376
just like you were.

1:40:35.942 --> 1:40:37.770
No.

1:40:38.902 --> 1:40:40.338
No, James.

1:40:40.382 --> 1:40:41.992
That's not right.

1:40:42.036 --> 1:40:44.212
Adrian did this to me.

1:40:48.477 --> 1:40:51.784
He is not the victim here.

1:40:51.828 --> 1:40:55.092
He was tied up in his basement.

1:40:55.136 --> 1:40:56.659
If he faked his own death,

1:40:56.702 --> 1:40:58.530
he could fake
his own kidnapping.

1:40:58.574 --> 1:41:00.706
We have Tom's body laying
in my living room,

1:41:00.750 --> 1:41:03.405
wearing some sort of suit
that you shot to pieces.

1:41:03.448 --> 1:41:06.060
If it did work, it doesn't now.

1:41:06.103 --> 1:41:08.453
But-but we have a whole bunch
of corroborative witnesses

1:41:08.497 --> 1:41:09.846
from the psychiatric hospital

1:41:09.889 --> 1:41:12.196
when it comes to seeing
something strange.

1:41:12.240 --> 1:41:14.459
Look, this is
your best-case scenario

1:41:14.503 --> 1:41:16.896
for getting
your freedom back, okay?

1:41:16.940 --> 1:41:19.116
No.

1:41:19.160 --> 1:41:20.422
I mean...

1:41:20.465 --> 1:41:23.120
I know Tom's body
is in your living room.

1:41:23.164 --> 1:41:24.426
Yeah.

1:41:25.775 --> 1:41:28.865
Adrian did everything
before that, though.

1:41:31.824 --> 1:41:34.088
He set his own brother up.

1:41:34.131 --> 1:41:36.438
I know how this works, Cee.

1:41:36.481 --> 1:41:38.222
I know. You don't understand.

1:41:38.266 --> 1:41:39.745
No, you don't understand.

1:41:39.789 --> 1:41:42.705
This is what he does.

1:41:42.748 --> 1:41:45.664
He makes me feel
like I'm the crazy one.

1:41:47.971 --> 1:41:49.799
This is...

1:41:49.842 --> 1:41:53.411
This is what he does.

1:41:53.455 --> 1:41:55.239
And he's doing it again.

1:41:55.283 --> 1:41:56.458
Okay, okay, but listen.

1:41:56.501 --> 1:41:58.764
I need you to keep that
to yourself

1:41:58.808 --> 1:42:01.158
-and let me do my job.

1:42:01.202 --> 1:42:02.942
Okay?

1:42:02.986 --> 1:42:04.509
Just let me help you.

1:42:04.553 --> 1:42:07.904
Yeah, but as long as Adrian's
around, you can't help me.

1:42:56.126 --> 1:42:57.867
ADRIAN :
Cecilia?

1:42:59.695 --> 1:43:02.219
I'm so glad you called.

1:43:40.997 --> 1:43:43.434
Well...

1:43:43.478 --> 1:43:45.871
You look amazing.

1:43:45.915 --> 1:43:49.919
I mean, you-you've always...
you always look amazing.

1:43:49.962 --> 1:43:52.704
I don't feel amazing.

1:43:52.748 --> 1:43:54.532
It's all a lie.

1:43:55.446 --> 1:43:57.970
Please, come on in.

1:43:58.014 --> 1:43:59.929
It's cold. Come on.

1:44:23.344 --> 1:44:26.564
So, I-I wanted to get us some
simple takeout, but, of course,

1:44:26.608 --> 1:44:28.958
I-I started obsessing over what
you'd be in the mood for.

1:44:29.001 --> 1:44:32.440
Hence, we have the OCD buffet
of sushi, steak and pasta.

1:44:34.572 --> 1:44:36.922
Or you might not
be hungry at all.

1:44:36.966 --> 1:44:38.837
Uh... which is so logical

1:44:38.881 --> 1:44:42.058
that it suddenly makes
this feast look moronic.

1:44:42.101 --> 1:44:43.494
CECILIA:
I'll have steak.

1:44:43.538 --> 1:44:45.061
That's a good choice.

1:44:55.811 --> 1:44:58.596
My hand's shaking.

1:44:58.640 --> 1:45:01.251
Uh...

1:45:05.908 --> 1:45:08.171
You know, you're the only
person in the world

1:45:08.214 --> 1:45:11.043
who gets to see my hand shake.

1:45:12.306 --> 1:45:14.960
It's 'cause I need you,
Cecilia.

1:45:16.005 --> 1:45:18.790
I know I didn't
treat you the way

1:45:18.834 --> 1:45:22.577
you should have been treated
when we were together.

1:45:22.620 --> 1:45:25.667
But I've learned my lesson.

1:45:28.365 --> 1:45:33.675
I would burn everything I own
just to prove that to you.

1:45:38.027 --> 1:45:39.594
Okay.

1:45:41.726 --> 1:45:43.380
Okay.

1:45:45.077 --> 1:45:49.908
If you want to be a part
of this child's life...

1:45:52.302 --> 1:45:55.044
...it has to start
with honesty.

1:45:55.087 --> 1:45:56.872
Of course.

1:46:02.094 --> 1:46:06.969
Which means I need you to admit
everything that you did.

1:46:11.060 --> 1:46:14.150
That it was you,

1:46:14.193 --> 1:46:16.152
not your brother.

1:46:18.241 --> 1:46:20.112
You.

1:46:22.071 --> 1:46:24.595
Cecilia.

1:46:27.555 --> 1:46:29.687
I loved my brother.

1:46:29.731 --> 1:46:31.689
And I thought he loved me, too.

1:46:34.910 --> 1:46:38.783
I know it didn't seem like it
to the outside world, but...

1:46:41.307 --> 1:46:43.440
Tom controlled me.

1:46:45.442 --> 1:46:47.531
Just tell me the truth.

1:46:47.575 --> 1:46:52.014
I need to know
that I'm not crazy, okay?

1:46:56.497 --> 1:46:59.500
And we can't start this
with a lie.

1:46:59.543 --> 1:47:01.850
But I'm not
starting with a lie.

1:47:05.114 --> 1:47:07.246
It wasn't me.

1:47:07.290 --> 1:47:09.031
I swear it.

1:47:09.074 --> 1:47:11.990
Why can't you just
tell me the truth?

1:47:12.034 --> 1:47:14.428
I am.

1:47:14.471 --> 1:47:16.081
Adrian, stop.

1:47:19.694 --> 1:47:23.567
I need you to do this for me.

1:47:25.526 --> 1:47:27.049
More than that,

1:47:27.092 --> 1:47:29.007
do it for you, Adrian.

1:47:30.879 --> 1:47:32.620
ADRIAN:
I'm giving you exactly

1:47:32.663 --> 1:47:34.970
what you're asking for,
Cecilia.

1:47:36.406 --> 1:47:40.715
I am telling you the truth.

1:47:46.503 --> 1:47:49.506
-Oh.

1:47:49.550 --> 1:47:52.117
Oh, no, no, no.

1:47:56.818 --> 1:48:00.822
I know that you feel like
you're going insane sometimes.

1:48:00.865 --> 1:48:04.129
But I'm the only one
who can help you.

1:48:04.173 --> 1:48:06.175
Remember?

1:48:06.218 --> 1:48:09.961
Because I know you better
than anyone else in the world.

1:48:12.181 --> 1:48:13.965
I mean...

1:48:14.009 --> 1:48:17.316
that shouldn't come as a...

1:48:17.360 --> 1:48:19.667
surprise.

1:48:36.858 --> 1:48:39.338
I should go clean myself up.

1:48:39.382 --> 1:48:40.905
Of course.

1:50:03.466 --> 1:50:05.903
No! No, no.

1:50:05.947 --> 1:50:10.516
No, no. What did you do?

1:50:10.560 --> 1:50:11.953
OPERATOR: 9-1-1,
what is your emergency?

1:50:11.996 --> 1:50:13.824
Please, please,
you have to help me, please.

1:50:13.868 --> 1:50:15.652
I'm with somebody,
and I think he's...

1:50:15.696 --> 1:50:17.523
he's tried to kill himself.

1:50:17.567 --> 1:50:19.047
Hurry. You have to help.

1:50:23.399 --> 1:50:26.532
You have to hurry. Please.

1:50:26.576 --> 1:50:32.016
It's, uh, 3333 Celestial Drive.

1:50:34.540 --> 1:50:36.760
Please.

1:50:55.170 --> 1:50:56.998
Surprise.

1:51:23.851 --> 1:51:25.504
JAMES:
Hey, hey.

1:51:25.548 --> 1:51:26.810
-Hey. You okay?
-It's okay.

1:51:26.854 --> 1:51:28.507
-You okay? What...
-I'm okay. I'm okay.

1:51:28.551 --> 1:51:30.684
James, look at me. I'm okay.

1:51:31.946 --> 1:51:33.774
He killed himself.

1:51:36.646 --> 1:51:39.170
He cut his own throat.

1:51:39.214 --> 1:51:41.390
There's security camera
video of it.

1:51:54.185 --> 1:51:55.839
You never did want to get him

1:51:55.883 --> 1:51:58.537
admitting anything
on tape, did you?

1:51:58.581 --> 1:52:00.409
Of course I did.

1:52:01.802 --> 1:52:04.500
I just didn't know
he was that unstable.

1:52:11.812 --> 1:52:14.510
You heard it, right?

1:52:14.553 --> 1:52:16.425
James?

1:52:18.644 --> 1:52:21.430
What'd it sound like to you?

1:52:29.177 --> 1:52:32.658
It sounded a lot like
he killed himself.
