00:02.769 --> 00:05.363
<i>On the last Fresh Prince of Bel-Air:</i>

00:05.905 --> 00:07.896
I'm so glad the trial is over
because now...

00:08.074 --> 00:11.009
...we can get to all those things
we've been putting off.

00:12.946 --> 00:17.007
Sounds like somebody got
a little booty duty, huh, Uncle Phil?

00:17.183 --> 00:20.118
Daddy, Pemberton Modeling Agency
wants me to sign with them.

00:20.286 --> 00:24.120
Come on, Uncle Phil, this is Ashley's
big chance for me to meet Naomi Campbell.

00:24.657 --> 00:27.285
- They're talking about putting me in a show.
- A big show.

00:27.460 --> 00:31.487
After which, all the models are gonna wanna
come home with Ashley and have coffee.

00:31.664 --> 00:33.757
Geoffrey, start making some damn coffee.

00:33.933 --> 00:37.460
Sweetheart, I don't have time right now.
I've gotta meet with Joe Winters.

00:37.637 --> 00:40.868
Joe Winters? Honey, you know how I feel
about you going into politics.

00:41.041 --> 00:43.441
Of course I do, sweetheart.
I'm just being polite.

00:43.610 --> 00:46.875
That man is on thin ice.

00:47.213 --> 00:49.647
I'll alert the fish.

00:50.250 --> 00:52.684
You know, Phil,
everything that you've been saying...

00:52.852 --> 00:54.945
...resonates with the people
in our community.

00:55.121 --> 00:58.284
That's why we're so thrilled
that you've decided to run.

00:58.458 --> 01:00.153
What?

01:01.227 --> 01:02.888
I want my husband back.

01:03.063 --> 01:05.429
Vivian, this is a great opportunity.

01:05.799 --> 01:07.664
- For whom?
- For all of us.

01:07.834 --> 01:12.635
The only thing I see is that somewhere
along the way "us" became you.

01:12.806 --> 01:14.899
And frankly,
I'm not gonna take it anymore.

01:15.075 --> 01:16.702
And what is that supposed to mean?

01:16.876 --> 01:19.276
Goodbye.

02:40.393 --> 02:42.293
I am having a terrible day.

02:42.462 --> 02:44.362
John Felipe
canceled my hair appointment.

02:44.531 --> 02:46.192
Kim Cho chipped one of my nails

02:46.366 --> 02:49.563
Moishe ran out of potato latkes...

02:49.736 --> 02:52.899
...and I can see Jose didn't cut the grass.

02:53.406 --> 02:56.398
Hilary, your parents just broke up.

02:56.776 --> 02:59.540
Oh, great.
On top of it all, now I'm an orphan?

03:01.014 --> 03:02.276
Hilary, you're 27.

03:02.448 --> 03:04.848
I know. No one adopts anyone over 9.

03:06.085 --> 03:07.882
Good morning.

03:08.087 --> 03:10.578
Way to put on the game face, Big Guy.

03:11.558 --> 03:14.220
Hey, Uncle Phil...

03:14.394 --> 03:18.524
...I just want you to know
that it's okay for a man to cry.

03:28.041 --> 03:30.305
Look, kids,
there's nothing to be concerned about.

03:30.476 --> 03:33.877
Your mother and I
just had a silly little misunderstanding.

03:34.047 --> 03:36.880
She'll be back before lunch.
It's no big deal.

03:37.050 --> 03:41.612
Well, I'd like to go on record here and now
that I, for one, am not concerned.

03:42.422 --> 03:46.688
I'm on your team, Governor Banks.

03:51.698 --> 03:56.863
Mm. Mm-mm-mm. Dinner smells delicious.
What do you have in that pot?

03:57.036 --> 03:59.300
Boiling water, sir.

04:00.139 --> 04:02.903
No one boils water like you, Geoffrey.

04:03.076 --> 04:05.544
- Anyone check the mail?
- It's on the counter, sir.

04:05.712 --> 04:07.270
Ah, this modern communications...

04:07.447 --> 04:10.348
...you mail something off yesterday
and it's here today.

04:10.516 --> 04:13.974
Boy, there are all kinds of ways
to keep in touch.

04:14.921 --> 04:16.582
Any messages for me?

04:16.755 --> 04:18.017
No messages.

04:18.190 --> 04:21.591
Why should there be? There's always
someone here to answer the phone.

04:22.662 --> 04:23.686
Any calls for me?

04:24.063 --> 04:26.861
Well, there was one.

04:27.033 --> 04:29.399
Yes, I knew it.

04:29.569 --> 04:32.265
So who was it?

04:32.438 --> 04:36.033
Your skirt steaks are down at the depot.
They'll be here by morning.

04:37.410 --> 04:40.538
Hey, Uncle Phil, so how's the single life?
Ha, ha, ha.

04:40.713 --> 04:43.705
- That's not funny.
- You are so right.

04:44.651 --> 04:47.745
- Has your Aunt Viv called?
- Yeah, she called a little while ago.

04:49.822 --> 04:51.983
And what does she have to say
about me, huh?

04:53.860 --> 04:55.760
Nothing.

04:56.162 --> 04:59.654
"Nothing," nothing?
She didn't even mention my name?

05:00.300 --> 05:03.861
- Oh, well, yeah, she mentioned your name.
- Well, what'd she say?

05:04.037 --> 05:08.337
- Oh, yeah, it was completely out of context.
- Well, tell me. Tell me.

05:09.575 --> 05:15.810
Well, she said, "Did you talk to your mom
back in Phil-adelphia?"

05:17.250 --> 05:20.913
Hey, come on, Uncle Phil. I'm sure
Aunt Viv is gonna be back real soon.

05:21.087 --> 05:22.952
Dad, what if she's not home soon?

05:23.122 --> 05:25.750
Don't you think maybe she's waiting
for you to go get her?

05:26.125 --> 05:30.061
Losing proposition.
Can only weaken your position.

05:30.229 --> 05:33.824
Besides, they're in her camp.

05:34.200 --> 05:39.297
If you want my advice,
nothing says "I want you back" like jewelry.

05:41.174 --> 05:43.870
You know, there's something to that.

05:44.344 --> 05:47.677
Unless, of course, they're setting us up.

05:50.016 --> 05:54.510
Well, she was upset,
maybe a gift isn't a bad idea.

05:55.488 --> 05:59.288
You know, I been a little unhappy
with you too, Uncle Phil.

05:59.459 --> 06:02.326
Yeah, you know,
I been thinking about leaving.

06:02.495 --> 06:04.258
Leave.

06:06.966 --> 06:09.696
Glad you keep that sense of humor,
Uncle Phil. Heh.

06:13.139 --> 06:18.202
Vivian, girl, you watching a talk show?
Please, the Bulls are playing.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.903
The Bulls?
Since when are you a sports enthusiast?

06:21.080 --> 06:23.776
Child, please. Since Michael Jordan
went back to the NBA...

06:23.950 --> 06:26.510
...and started wearing
them shorts again. Ah!

06:26.686 --> 06:29.154
Look at those buns. Booyah!

06:31.023 --> 06:32.081
Whoo!

06:33.426 --> 06:37.487
- Go away.
Open the door, Helen. It's Philip.

06:38.398 --> 06:43.631
I'd give him a blast of pepper spray
but I'm afraid he'd just eat it.

06:45.271 --> 06:46.966
Let him in.

06:48.574 --> 06:50.439
Coming.

06:52.845 --> 06:54.642
- Daddy.
Ha, ha, ha.

06:54.814 --> 06:58.409
How you doing, buddy? You having
a good time here at your Aunt Helen's?

06:58.584 --> 07:02.213
Yeah. She's teaching me
all kinds of cool stuff, fat-head.

07:02.388 --> 07:06.324
Ha, ha, ha. Honey. Honey, please. You
mustn't repeat things Aunt Helen tell you.

07:06.492 --> 07:09.825
Ha, ha, ha. Come on. Let's go upstairs
and watch the game. Come on.

07:18.004 --> 07:19.096
What are you doing here?

07:19.705 --> 07:21.673
I was just driving
around the neighborhood.

07:21.841 --> 07:26.301
I heard they were... They had this...
This thing down at that place I hadn't...

07:28.915 --> 07:30.246
I miss you, Vivian.

07:32.151 --> 07:36.485
I'm sorry for not including you in
my decision to enter politics. I was wrong.

07:36.656 --> 07:38.317
Can we just put this behind us?

07:44.797 --> 07:48.062
And I bought you a little something.

07:48.234 --> 07:50.259
Oh, Tiffany's.

07:50.436 --> 07:52.734
Get it appraised!

07:53.539 --> 07:55.564
This is beautiful, Philip.

07:56.075 --> 07:57.736
Thank you.

07:57.910 --> 08:00.174
Now, can we just go home?

08:01.214 --> 08:04.342
I can't tell you how happy I am
you're giving up politics.

08:04.517 --> 08:06.951
I never said I was giving up politics.

08:07.119 --> 08:08.746
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.

08:08.921 --> 08:12.516
I said I was sorry for not including you
in my decision to enter politics.

08:12.692 --> 08:14.717
I never said anything about not entering.

08:15.094 --> 08:18.086
You came all the way down here
and nothing has changed?

08:18.264 --> 08:21.131
Vivian,
I know that you don't love politics, but...

08:21.300 --> 08:24.861
- This is not about politics. It's about us.
- What are you talking about?

08:25.371 --> 08:28.169
I want what I thought we've wanted
all the time...

08:28.341 --> 08:31.777
...and now all of a sudden,
you want something completely different.

08:32.278 --> 08:36.179
Vivian, I came all the way down here,
I said I was sorry, I said I was wrong.

08:36.349 --> 08:40.785
- Now, what more do you want from me?
- Right now, I want you to leave.

08:42.255 --> 08:44.519
If I leave I'm not coming back, Vivian.

08:45.258 --> 08:46.987
Good.

08:49.362 --> 08:51.626
Because when I walk out that door,
I'm gone.

08:56.068 --> 08:58.229
I'm moving closer to the door, Vivian.

08:58.738 --> 09:01.104
This is your last chance.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.271
I mean it.

09:04.710 --> 09:08.578
Oh, for God's sake,
would you leave already!

09:24.730 --> 09:27.790
I think it's so romantic,
Dad going to get Mom.

09:27.967 --> 09:31.767
It's like in that movie where after
a big fight, the wife stays with her sister...

09:31.938 --> 09:36.398
...and the next day the husband buys her
something expensive and she returns home.

09:38.811 --> 09:41.371
Hil, that's not a movie,
that's what happened.

09:41.547 --> 09:45.005
Oh, well,
someone should make a movie of it.

09:46.118 --> 09:47.745
Oh, where's Mom?
- Is she outside?

09:47.920 --> 09:49.512
- No.
- What, she's in the car?

09:49.689 --> 09:52.123
- I'm gonna go get her bags.
- She's not out there.

09:52.525 --> 09:54.584
Good Lord, what did you do to her?

09:56.596 --> 09:59.030
Don't worry, Big Guy, I got you covered.

09:59.198 --> 10:00.961
He was with me the whole time.

10:03.169 --> 10:05.160
She's at your Aunt Helen's.

10:05.338 --> 10:06.896
Well, what happened?

10:07.073 --> 10:10.634
Nothing. And nothing's gonna happen.

10:12.311 --> 10:14.905
This sounds a little serious.

10:15.081 --> 10:18.414
Can you imagine
if they never got back together?

10:23.322 --> 10:27.952
Has anybody seen my hat?
Where the hell is my hat?

10:29.929 --> 10:34.025
Dad? You're not hiding my hat
so I have to stay home again, are you?

10:34.200 --> 10:38.466
Oh, do you really have to go to work?
I'm Ionely.

10:38.638 --> 10:42.096
Yes, Dad.
And what are you doing out of your room?

10:42.274 --> 10:44.504
I wanna hear another story.

10:44.677 --> 10:47.612
Okay. You wanna hear another story.

10:47.780 --> 10:50.544
Once upon a time
a little girl could've been a supermodel...

10:50.716 --> 10:54.447
...but her parents got divorced and she
lost it all. The end. Wanna hear another?

10:55.488 --> 10:58.150
No. No. Save something for tonight.

11:01.761 --> 11:03.888
Can't you stay a few more minutes?

11:04.063 --> 11:08.898
I could if the car wasn't repossessed
and if I didn't have to walk to work.

11:10.269 --> 11:12.499
Exercise would do you good.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.800
Was that a fat joke?

11:25.818 --> 11:29.481
- Would you care for something to drink?
- Yes, please.

11:33.259 --> 11:35.989
You rang, Master Geoffrey?

11:36.829 --> 11:38.387
What took you so long?

11:40.466 --> 11:41.797
Two more, please, Philip.

11:42.334 --> 11:44.234
- Fluff those cushions.
- Yes. Yes.

11:44.403 --> 11:46.633
Dust the bookshelf.

11:46.806 --> 11:49.104
Clean the bathroom upstairs.

11:49.275 --> 11:50.742
Shine the mirror.

11:50.910 --> 11:53.743
Straighten the pictures. Tidy the plants.

11:53.913 --> 11:55.972
Get me a rose.

12:12.665 --> 12:16.226
For the love of God, man,
shred, shred, shred.

12:16.402 --> 12:19.667
If I could just figure out
who's been leaking all this to the press.

12:19.839 --> 12:21.602
It must be an inside job.

12:24.877 --> 12:26.572
Geoffrey, keep shredding.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.714
Yes, sir.

12:28.881 --> 12:29.905
Carlton.

12:30.082 --> 12:34.018
Oh, don't worry, Big Guy,
I'm taking care of our little problem.

12:34.186 --> 12:36.677
Our little problem? Heh, heh, heh.

12:36.922 --> 12:39.914
Son, what were you thinking?

12:40.693 --> 12:43.218
What was I thinking?
I told you everything I was doing.

12:43.395 --> 12:45.454
You were involved every step of the way.

12:45.631 --> 12:49.465
I have no recollection
of the event in question.

12:49.635 --> 12:50.829
No recollection?

12:51.003 --> 12:54.370
It was all for you.
Ever since Mom left, it's all been for you.

12:54.540 --> 12:57.737
I have no recollection
of the event in question.

13:28.707 --> 13:32.837
I just wanted to stop by and tell you that
even though your parents are divorced...

13:33.012 --> 13:35.572
...you're still the most beautiful woman
I've ever seen.

13:36.382 --> 13:38.247
Thank you very much.

13:40.019 --> 13:42.487
Now, be gone.

14:06.946 --> 14:08.743
So, what'd you wanna ask me?

14:09.782 --> 14:15.618
Katie, look, you know, we've been dating
each other for a long time now...

14:15.955 --> 14:20.289
...and I just wanna tell you that I've never
loved anybody the way that I love you.

14:25.331 --> 14:27.162
Katie...

14:28.367 --> 14:31.859
...will you marry...?
- Hey, what up, dawg? What it be like?

14:32.338 --> 14:34.704
I've been out traveling the world and...

14:35.107 --> 14:36.369
Whoa.

14:37.076 --> 14:38.976
Who is this lovely young lady?

14:39.511 --> 14:42.844
- Oh, Uncle Phil, this is Katie.
- Ah.

14:43.015 --> 14:45.540
Katie, Katie, Katie.

14:45.718 --> 14:47.709
Sexy lady.

14:49.588 --> 14:51.453
Will's told me an awful lot about you...

14:51.624 --> 14:55.025
...but what he failed to tell me
was you were so good-Iooking.

14:55.194 --> 14:58.960
Heh, heh. Yeah, well, the young brother gets
convenient amnesia every once in a while.

14:59.131 --> 15:01.395
You know what I'm saying.
Heh, heh, heh.

15:02.968 --> 15:05.801
Hey, Uncle Phil,
can I rap to you for a sec?

15:05.971 --> 15:08.166
- Oh, yeah. Sure. Sure.
- Excuse us, Katie.

15:08.340 --> 15:10.308
You stay there, baby.

15:10.843 --> 15:14.335
Um, Uncle Phil, I'm in the middle
of something important right now.

15:14.747 --> 15:16.078
Oh!

15:16.615 --> 15:19.743
My bad. Hey, you know.
Because... Well, you know.

15:19.919 --> 15:24.049
Let me just go on upstairs here
and take a shower because I'm feeling...

15:24.957 --> 15:27.050
...kind of dirty.

15:30.629 --> 15:33.996
- How about I shower with you?
- Ooh.

15:34.199 --> 15:35.689
Hey, hey, hey, Uncle Phil.

15:35.868 --> 15:40.066
Hey, hey, hey,
don't be a player hater, my brother.

15:43.242 --> 15:44.732
Every time.

15:44.910 --> 15:47.777
Every damn time. Every time!

15:47.947 --> 15:50.381
- Will.
- Every time I turn around it's the same thing!

15:50.549 --> 15:51.846
- Will.
- Over and over!

15:54.887 --> 15:58.323
Uh... We need to get them two
back together.

15:59.425 --> 16:02.417
Come on, come on. Come on.

16:10.235 --> 16:13.329
- Are you sure about this place, Will?
- Sure?

16:13.505 --> 16:17.339
Come on,
it's great food and grass skirts...

16:17.509 --> 16:20.876
...and great live entertainment.

16:21.046 --> 16:23.879
<i>Tall and tan and young and lovely</i>

16:24.049 --> 16:26.847
<i>- A girl from lpanema goes walking
- He's butchering it.</i>

16:27.219 --> 16:33.317
<i>And when she passes
Each one she passes goes, "Ah"</i>

16:34.760 --> 16:37.854
<i>When she walks, she's like a samba</i>

16:38.030 --> 16:41.329
<i>She swings so cool and sways so gentle</i>

16:41.500 --> 16:47.962
<i>That when she passes
Each one she passes goes, "Ooh"</i>

16:49.341 --> 16:52.310
Now, that's how
it's supposed to be done.

16:57.182 --> 16:59.810
- I'm out of here.
- Wait, wait. Wait a minute, Uncle Phil.

16:59.985 --> 17:02.715
Now, I didn't wanna
have to make the hard sell, but...

17:02.888 --> 17:04.219
Excuse me.

17:04.390 --> 17:08.792
- they got three pages worth
of pork dishes up in here.

17:09.161 --> 17:12.358
Well, since we're already here...
Heh, heh, heh.

17:12.531 --> 17:17.468
I'll tell you, Viv. I come here all the time.
They got food, entertainment...

17:17.636 --> 17:20.799
...and men in grass skirts. Look at that.
Ha, ha!

17:20.973 --> 17:22.736
Come here, boy. Come back here.

17:22.907 --> 17:26.776
Ha, ha. They wouldn't let me
bring my leaf blower.

17:26.944 --> 17:31.541
Whoo-hoo-hoo! Look who is here.

17:31.717 --> 17:33.548
Oh, hey, what a small world.

17:33.719 --> 17:36.051
It just got smaller.

17:36.221 --> 17:40.555
Boy, are we gonna have a good time.
Whoo-whoo!

17:41.727 --> 17:43.786
I can feel the love in this room.

17:47.066 --> 17:48.590
Yeah.

17:51.603 --> 17:54.504
You know, I don't know
if it's possible or even safe...

17:54.673 --> 17:58.268
...to have any more fun than we're having
right now, but let's give it a shot.

17:58.444 --> 18:00.844
- Uncle Phil, how about some karaoke?
- No.

18:01.847 --> 18:03.610
Okay, fine.

18:03.949 --> 18:08.045
That's just like you.
If it's not your idea, you don't wanna do it.

18:08.220 --> 18:10.017
- What?
- Okay, you know what? That's it.

18:10.189 --> 18:11.986
We are getting up from this table.

18:12.157 --> 18:14.955
- You two are gonna sit here and talk.
Where are you...?

18:15.127 --> 18:19.757
And I'm taking the keys.
I got the keys. See? See? Hey?

18:20.532 --> 18:22.466
I don't hear nothing.

18:27.906 --> 18:32.400
<i>Stop in the name of love</i>

18:32.578 --> 18:36.514
<i>Before you break my heart</i>

18:36.682 --> 18:40.641
<i>Think it over</i>

18:46.225 --> 18:48.056
Well, I guess I could take a cab.

18:48.227 --> 18:50.957
That's right,
run right back to campaign central.

18:51.130 --> 18:52.859
Give it a rest, Vivian.

18:53.031 --> 18:56.489
- What's the matter, can't take the truth?
- The truth is you overreacted.

18:56.668 --> 18:59.762
I did not overreact. You lied.

19:02.007 --> 19:03.372
<i>Reunited</i>

19:03.542 --> 19:06.102
<i>And it feels so good</i>

19:06.278 --> 19:08.109
<i>Go on, kiss her, Phil, baby</i>

19:08.280 --> 19:13.946
<i>Reunited and it's understood</i>

19:15.053 --> 19:16.884
Vivian, I told you I was sorry.

19:17.055 --> 19:19.523
I don't know how many ways to say it.
I was wrong.

19:19.691 --> 19:21.522
That's not what I'm talking about.

19:21.693 --> 19:24.958
I'm talking about the 28 years
of dreaming and waiting...

19:25.130 --> 19:29.066
...for when we'd be in a position
to have some time to ourselves.

19:29.234 --> 19:31.099
Now I find out it's all a lie.

19:31.270 --> 19:33.363
Vivian, I didn't lie.

19:35.574 --> 19:38.600
<i>Philip, you must make a pact</i>

19:38.777 --> 19:40.005
<i>Ooh</i>

19:40.179 --> 19:45.344
<i>You gonna bring my Aunt Viv back
- Ooh</i>

19:45.517 --> 19:52.320
<i>Where there is love, you'll be there</i>

19:52.491 --> 19:54.857
<i>Just look over your shoulders, Philip</i>

19:55.027 --> 19:57.962
Philip, I stood behind you.
I supported you.

19:58.130 --> 20:02.260
I rooted for you every step of the way.
But the long nights and the dinners alone...

20:02.434 --> 20:05.426
...and the postponed vacations
were not supposed to last forever.

20:05.604 --> 20:10.007
They won't. Just because I'm running for
political office doesn't mean I'm gonna win.

20:10.175 --> 20:12.234
Philip, you win at everything.

20:12.411 --> 20:15.346
Ha, ha. Touché, you got me there.
Ha, ha, ha.

20:15.781 --> 20:19.945
Philip, you always said that spending time
with me and the family...

20:20.118 --> 20:22.313
...was the most important thing to you.

20:22.487 --> 20:23.545
It is.

20:24.022 --> 20:25.922
Why can't we have it all?

20:26.091 --> 20:29.288
Can we?
Can you honestly sit there and tell me...

20:29.461 --> 20:32.760
...I can have my husband back,
the kids can have their father back...

20:32.931 --> 20:36.560
...and you can serve in office
all at the same time?

20:36.735 --> 20:38.828
Can you say that to me?

20:39.538 --> 20:40.596
I want to...

20:42.474 --> 20:46.467
...but I can't. Look, Vivian, I didn't lie.
I want the same things that you want...

20:46.645 --> 20:51.514
...and maybe I did overlook a few things
before I decided to run for office.

20:55.220 --> 20:56.380
I love you.

20:58.323 --> 21:01.087
What am I gonna do
with all those campaign buttons?

21:03.462 --> 21:06.158
- Come on, let's get out of here.
- Good.

21:06.698 --> 21:09.394
- Wait. Hold up, hold up. Where y'all going?
Wait a minute.

21:09.568 --> 21:11.160
Come on, we got one more number.

21:11.336 --> 21:13.566
Yeah, come on, y'all,
this is our big finish.

21:15.440 --> 21:17.704
<i>Day-o
- Day-o</i>

21:17.876 --> 21:20.242
Ay-yay-yay-yay! Oh!

21:20.412 --> 21:23.677
<i>- It's day-o
- It's day-o</i>

21:23.849 --> 21:28.183
<i>Daylight come and me wanna go home</i>

21:28.353 --> 21:30.116
Bree-ba-ba! Bree-ba-ba!

21:30.689 --> 21:32.350
<i>Day-o
Day-o</i>

21:33.859 --> 21:35.520
<i>It's day-o
- It's day-o</i>

21:35.694 --> 21:36.820
Rasta! Ba!

21:36.995 --> 21:42.194
<i>Daylight come and me wanna go home</i>
