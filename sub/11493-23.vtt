<i>Previously on:</i>

00:02.750 --> 00:04.960
I know that I said that I wanted
to get rid of her

00:04.962 --> 00:07.048
and have you come back...
Oh, no!

00:07.055 --> 00:08.749
I'm just going to have
to make it work.

00:08.774 --> 00:10.256
No, no, no, no, no!

00:10.257 --> 00:11.357
I'm sorry!

00:11.359 --> 00:13.976
Okay, I'll figure something out.

00:13.978 --> 00:16.445
If nothing else,
I am a survivor.

00:22.077 --> 00:24.557
Doctor said you had
a little heart attack.

00:24.582 --> 00:26.582
Yeah, I remember now.

00:27.408 --> 00:29.608
Zoey's moving in...

00:29.610 --> 00:33.212
and I'm moving out...

00:34.949 --> 00:36.549
No...

00:36.551 --> 00:38.069
No... you're not moving out.

00:38.070 --> 00:38.815
I'm not?

00:38.840 --> 00:41.140
No, you can stay
as long as you want,

00:41.172 --> 00:42.755
as long as you need.

00:42.757 --> 00:46.058
Oh, that's... that's so good to hear.

00:47.768 --> 00:49.686
Really, you don't have
to carry my bags.

00:49.688 --> 00:51.471
Alan, you had
a heart attack, okay?

00:51.473 --> 00:52.722
You need to take it easy.

00:52.724 --> 00:54.274
Well, I appreciate it,
but I'm fine.

00:54.276 --> 00:57.093
Whoa, do not say that.

00:57.095 --> 00:58.311
Why not?

00:58.313 --> 01:00.096
Let me tell you
about my Grandma Abigail.

01:00.098 --> 01:02.499
When I was a kid,
she came to move in with us.

01:02.501 --> 01:04.684
And one day I said,
"How ya doing, Grandma""

01:04.686 --> 01:08.905
And she said, "Fine."
And then she dropped dead.

01:08.907 --> 01:10.040
You're kidding.

01:10.042 --> 01:12.876
No, face down in my Legos.

01:12.878 --> 01:15.445
Well, that's terrible.

01:15.447 --> 01:18.165
But I'm fine.
Do not say that!

01:18.167 --> 01:19.966
My Uncle Hal?

01:19.968 --> 01:22.252
When I was a kid, he used
to spend Thanksgivings us,

01:22.254 --> 01:23.670
and one year,
we're at dinner and...

01:23.672 --> 01:25.672
you know, like football
and turkey and the whole bit,

01:25.674 --> 01:27.557
and I said,
"How ya doing, Uncle Hal""

01:27.559 --> 01:28.708
And he said, "Fine""

01:28.710 --> 01:30.443
And then he went
to the bathroom,

01:30.445 --> 01:33.263
and he crapped out
his small intestines.

01:34.732 --> 01:36.583
Oh, oh... okay,
t-that's horrible,

01:36.585 --> 01:39.186
but I promise you,
I am fine.

01:39.188 --> 01:40.937
Surprise!

01:43.807 --> 01:46.809
I told you not to say it!

Oh, my God,
somebody call 911.

Gotcha.

02:03.049 --> 02:05.082
Oh...

02:05.084 --> 02:09.220
Alan, don't you ever
do that to me again.

02:09.222 --> 02:10.937
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

02:10.940 --> 02:13.190
So all you guys came
just to welcome me back?

02:13.192 --> 02:15.509
Of course we did, darling.
We were worried about you.

02:15.511 --> 02:19.697
Yeah, I've been beside myself
with concern.

02:19.699 --> 02:22.149
I don't know what to say.
I'm really touched.

02:22.151 --> 02:23.734
Come here, Alan.

02:23.736 --> 02:25.653
Sit down.
I made you some tea.

02:25.655 --> 02:27.037
Wait, did you just
call me Alan?

02:27.039 --> 02:28.355
Well, that's your name,
isn't it?

02:28.357 --> 02:29.824
Yeah, but you always
call me Zippy.

02:29.826 --> 02:31.876
I know, but I've got
a little rule.

02:31.878 --> 02:35.045
I never make fun of someone who
could come back and haunt me.

02:36.865 --> 02:38.465
Sugar or honey?

02:38.467 --> 02:40.301
I thought we decided on Alan?

02:41.637 --> 02:42.369
Uh, honey, please.

02:42.371 --> 02:43.695
Hey, are you warm enough?

02:43.722 --> 02:44.668
Do you want me
to turn up the heat?

02:44.806 --> 02:46.257
I'm fine.
Don't say that...

02:46.259 --> 02:48.392
Okay, turn up the heat.

02:48.394 --> 02:51.011
Why don't you just lay down.

02:51.013 --> 02:51.762
Uh, no, really, I'm good.
I've been in bed for a week.

02:51.764 --> 02:53.314
Do it for me.

02:53.316 --> 02:54.982
Uh, okay, but let me
just point out

02:55.934 --> 02:57.067
that that never works
when I say that to you.

02:58.888 --> 03:00.688
Guess what. While you were
in the hospital,

03:00.709 --> 03:02.084
I aced all my final exams.

03:02.425 --> 03:03.575
Really?!
I don't believe it!

03:03.576 --> 03:06.911
I told you
he wouldn't buy it.

03:06.913 --> 03:08.863
Wait, wait, wait.
You lied to me?

03:09.915 --> 03:12.316
Uh, I told him to. I thought
the truth might kill you.

03:13.401 --> 03:15.252
But there is some real good news.
What's that?

03:15.954 --> 03:17.071
I found out for sure
I'm not gay.

03:17.672 --> 03:19.273
But why's that good news?

03:19.275 --> 03:21.625
It's mostly good news
for gay people.

03:23.762 --> 03:26.463
A-A-All right, look,
I appreciate

03:26.465 --> 03:28.549
all the trouble you're taking
to welcome me home,

03:29.751 --> 03:31.368
but if you don't mind, I'd just
like to go back to my room.

03:31.853 --> 03:33.153
Oh, you heard him.

03:33.205 --> 03:34.138
He wants to go to his room.
Here, Zoey.

03:34.522 --> 03:35.973
Take the tea.

03:35.975 --> 03:37.725
Walden, I can walk on my own.

03:38.810 --> 03:40.394
That's what my
blind Aunt Shirley said.

03:40.979 --> 03:41.895
And then we went to Miami

03:41.980 --> 03:43.113
on Christmas vacation,

03:43.115 --> 03:44.565
and then "blam""

03:44.566 --> 03:46.300
Greyhound came out of nowhere
and flattened her.

03:46.393 --> 03:47.193
She got hit by a bus?

03:47.944 --> 03:49.087
No, she wandered
onto the dog track

03:49.112 --> 03:50.335
in the middle
of the ninth race.

03:51.281 --> 03:53.115
Technically,
she came in third.

03:54.684 --> 03:57.420
Anyway, I got a little
♪ surprise for you. ♪

03:58.321 --> 03:59.739
Oh, Walden, you've already
done so much.

04:00.824 --> 04:02.241
I don't know what else
you could possibly...

04:04.294 --> 04:05.911
A real bed!
Yeah.

04:05.913 --> 04:08.330
It's not just a bed.
Get on it. Check it out.

04:09.032 --> 04:10.332
Oh, my golly.

04:10.334 --> 04:12.618
Ah...
Oo-ho-ho-ho!

04:12.620 --> 04:15.254
The bed is becoming tumescent.

04:15.256 --> 04:16.889
Yeah...!

04:16.891 --> 04:18.507
Pretty cool, uh?

04:18.509 --> 04:20.341
See, so you don't have
to exert yourself

04:20.728 --> 04:21.644
when you're getting
in and out.

04:21.644 --> 04:22.928
Ah! Oh,

04:22.930 --> 04:24.597
and what pray tell is that?

04:25.649 --> 04:29.318
That is a 46" high-definition
plasma screen TV,

04:29.320 --> 04:31.904
complete with a deluxe sports
satellite package

04:31.906 --> 04:34.323
Nice! No movies?

04:35.942 --> 04:37.993
No, we could switch it
to a movie package.

04:38.478 --> 04:40.112
Or you could add it.

04:40.914 --> 04:42.698
Oh, okay, we'll add it.

04:43.283 --> 04:44.166
And don't forget
the adult channels.

04:45.385 --> 04:46.619
No problem.

04:46.621 --> 04:48.037
You have to ask
for them specifically.

04:48.622 --> 04:49.371
Otherwise they block them.

04:49.373 --> 04:50.790
Right.

04:50.792 --> 04:53.492
Hey, why don't you take
a nap until dinner?

04:54.094 --> 04:54.960
I'm not tired.

04:54.962 --> 04:56.545
That's what my
cousin Earl said

04:57.798 --> 04:58.714
right before he fell asleep
with a cigarette in his hand.

04:59.216 --> 04:59.999
Set his bed on fire?

05:00.534 --> 05:01.534
No, his fireworks stand.

05:02.702 --> 05:05.054
I was standing across the street
yelling at him to wake up

05:06.306 --> 05:09.007
when the first rocket went off,
followed by 800 Roman candles.

05:10.060 --> 05:14.179
It was horrifying and really
cool at the same time.

05:14.181 --> 05:16.148
Okay, I'll take a nap.

05:16.150 --> 05:17.349
Good, good, good,
you just...

05:18.068 --> 05:19.068
I don't want you
to do anything.

05:19.069 --> 05:20.128
Just relax
and get better.

05:20.370 --> 05:21.653
That's a nice thought, Walden,

05:21.655 --> 05:22.488
but I got a lot of work to do.

05:22.489 --> 05:23.492
I got bills to pay.

05:23.657 --> 05:24.707
No, don't worry about the bills.

05:24.708 --> 05:25.782
I'll take care of everything.

05:26.526 --> 05:28.012
Walden, I can't let you
just take care of everything.

05:28.228 --> 05:30.530
Listen, I made a promise to
myself when I was 11 years old

05:30.797 --> 05:33.015
and salmonella decimated
my father's entire side

05:33.166 --> 05:34.820
of the family
at the annual Easter egg hunt.

05:35.168 --> 05:36.552
Nobody else dies on my watch.

05:40.056 --> 05:43.342
Poor guy,
living with all that guilt.

05:44.978 --> 05:47.179
I can exploit that.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.349
How come you're not coming over?

05:50.851 --> 05:52.050
I can't. I have Ava.

05:52.519 --> 05:53.671
Why don't you come over here?

05:53.887 --> 05:54.937
I can't. I have Alan.

05:54.939 --> 05:56.739
Oh, for God's sake.

05:56.741 --> 05:58.891
Well, he had
a heart attack, Zoey.

05:59.292 --> 05:59.959
Oh, bollocks.

05:59.961 --> 06:01.894
He's going to outlive us all.

06:03.079 --> 06:04.830
A week after nuclear Armageddon,
the world will be populated

06:05.732 --> 06:07.950
by nothing but cockroaches
and Alan Harper.

06:07.952 --> 06:11.787
Wow, that is a side of you
that is not attractive.

06:12.422 --> 06:13.529
It's the lawyer side of me.

06:13.573 --> 06:14.874
Yeah, yuck.

06:14.876 --> 06:18.076
Look, I see these kind
of scam artists all the time

06:19.045 --> 06:20.579
and I don't want
you being taken advantage of.

06:21.414 --> 06:22.715
I am just taking care
of my friend.

06:23.850 --> 06:26.685
No, you are providing food,
shelter, and satellite TV

06:26.687 --> 06:28.437
to a cockroach.

06:28.439 --> 06:30.806
Hello, anybody?

06:30.808 --> 06:33.392
Getting kind of hungry
in here.

06:33.394 --> 06:35.978
Uh, B-Berta, Alan's hungry.

06:35.980 --> 06:37.429
Is his dinner ready yet?

06:37.931 --> 06:38.781
Coming up.

06:38.783 --> 06:40.566
Really?

06:40.568 --> 06:42.034
He gets room service?

06:42.036 --> 06:44.069
Did I ever tell you
about my Aunt Phyllis?

06:45.439 --> 06:48.880
When I was a kid she took me
on a trip to New York,

06:49.125 --> 06:50.610
and we were staying
at the Waldorf-Astoria,

06:50.627 --> 06:52.248
and she didn't want
to wait for room service,

06:52.278 --> 06:53.745
so she headed down
to the restaurant

06:54.214 --> 06:57.549
and she fell 24 stories
down an empty elevator shaft.

06:58.752 --> 07:01.787
We never got to see <i>Cats.</i>

07:01.789 --> 07:05.174
So you're afraid Alan is going
to fall into an elevator shaft?

07:06.226 --> 07:08.394
Don't poke at it, Zoey.
The wound is still fresh.

07:14.518 --> 07:15.684
Come in.

07:17.604 --> 07:19.972
Did my little buddy save
room for dessert?

07:20.473 --> 07:21.607
I sure did, Skipper.

07:21.609 --> 07:23.359
Good, 'cause I made
your favorite.

07:23.893 --> 07:24.643
Peach cobbler?
Yep.

07:24.645 --> 07:25.811
Warm with ice cream?

07:26.312 --> 07:27.913
I'll be right back.

07:27.915 --> 07:29.531
I'm not going anywhere.

07:30.818 --> 07:35.754
Okay, let's see
what's on those adult channels.

07:35.756 --> 07:37.206
<i>Avatart.</i>

07:37.208 --> 07:40.209
Oh, in 3D.

07:42.345 --> 07:43.128
Oh, to be continued.

07:43.714 --> 07:44.880
Come in.

07:46.332 --> 07:47.549
Hey, you.

07:47.551 --> 07:50.002
Judith, what a,
what a nice surprise.

07:50.503 --> 07:51.336
How are you feeling?

07:52.005 --> 07:53.522
Not bad, all things considered.

07:53.524 --> 07:54.974
Oh, you're so brave.

07:54.976 --> 07:57.693
Now, listen, there's something
we need to talk about.

07:58.678 --> 08:00.683
Look, I know the child support
checks are late,

08:00.780 --> 08:02.514
but, but please allow me
to get back to my job.

08:04.285 --> 08:06.869
Er?

08:06.871 --> 08:09.021
Forget the
child support.

08:09.023 --> 08:11.073
Er?

08:11.075 --> 08:12.291
You just get better.

08:13.159 --> 08:14.376
I can manage fine
without your money.

08:14.711 --> 08:15.661
All right.

08:15.663 --> 08:17.997
I always suspected as much,
but thank you.

08:18.999 --> 08:20.714
And Herb and I have the
condo in Palm Springs,

08:20.751 --> 08:22.172
so you're certainly
welcome to use it

08:22.302 --> 08:23.168
while you're
recuperating.

08:23.170 --> 08:25.037
How can you afford
a condo in Palm Springs?

08:25.391 --> 08:27.441
We made a judgment call
with Jake's college fund.

08:28.008 --> 08:30.542
Anyway, you're
welcome to use it.

08:30.544 --> 08:32.678
Wow, thank you,
th-that's very generous.

08:32.679 --> 08:36.315
Well, look, I know we've
obviously had our differences.

08:36.317 --> 08:38.017
We have.

08:38.019 --> 08:40.436
And I haven't always
been very nice to you.

08:41.187 --> 08:43.054
I just figured
you didn't like me.

08:43.057 --> 08:45.566
Alan, we were married
for 12 years.

08:45.725 --> 08:47.143
You're the father
of my son.

08:47.343 --> 08:48.463
Just because I couldn't
stay married to you

08:48.464 --> 08:49.998
doesn't mean I
stopped loving you.

08:50.229 --> 08:51.830
Gee, it sure felt
that way.

08:51.832 --> 08:53.699
Oh, I'm sorry
for that.

08:53.701 --> 08:56.401
You just get
well, okay?

08:56.403 --> 08:58.170
Okay.

09:02.959 --> 09:05.961
A house in Malibu,
no child support,

09:05.963 --> 09:08.547
free condo in Palm Springs.

09:08.549 --> 09:11.600
Why would anyone want
to eliminate heart disease?

09:15.689 --> 09:17.856
Don't worry,
you lovely blue ladies,

09:18.608 --> 09:20.112
as soon
as my right hand is free,

09:20.310 --> 09:22.528
I'll be giving you
my full attention.

09:23.814 --> 09:24.813
Rats.

09:24.815 --> 09:26.065
Uh...

09:27.735 --> 09:29.101
Come in.

09:29.953 --> 09:31.954
How's my man?

09:31.956 --> 09:34.623
Oh, you know, okay

09:34.625 --> 09:38.110
for a guy who recently stared
into the jaws of death.

09:38.611 --> 09:39.726
That's why I'm here.

09:39.978 --> 09:41.196
I want to help
with your recovery.

09:41.521 --> 09:43.182
Really, what'd
you have in mind?

09:43.282 --> 09:44.116
I-I'm not supposed
to exert myself.

09:45.052 --> 09:47.753
Don't worry, you don't have
to do a thing.

09:48.638 --> 09:50.455
Just lie back
and I'll do all the work.

09:50.723 --> 09:51.140
Really?

09:51.142 --> 09:52.508
Hmm.
Okay.

09:52.510 --> 09:54.093
Uh, let me put
my cobbler down.

09:54.627 --> 09:55.961
No, no, no,
keep it.

09:55.963 --> 09:56.895
You sure?

09:56.897 --> 09:58.964
Absolutely.

09:58.966 --> 10:01.400
It'd be rude for
me to eat alone.

10:04.654 --> 10:06.638
All righty then.

10:08.641 --> 10:11.110
You got any porn
on this thing?

10:11.694 --> 10:13.078
Uh, gee, I,
I don't know.

10:15.416 --> 10:16.915
Why don't you check?

10:16.917 --> 10:18.316
Shake things up a bit.

10:18.868 --> 10:20.452
Oh, gosh,
well, I, yeah,

10:20.454 --> 10:22.788
I guess I, I guess I,
I-I could do that.

10:24.758 --> 10:28.427
Oh, look,
there's some now.

10:28.429 --> 10:30.345
How fortuitous.

10:30.347 --> 10:34.967
Now, just relax and
enjoy your cobbler.

10:34.969 --> 10:37.102
Right back at you.

10:40.858 --> 10:44.527
This is the best day
of my entire life.

All right, Mr. Harper.

11:04.186 --> 11:05.886
Well, I've got
some good news.

11:06.271 --> 11:07.054
Let me have it.

11:07.689 --> 11:09.657
I'm banging my receptionist.

11:11.243 --> 11:12.393
I'm sorry.

11:12.395 --> 11:14.962
I... I never get tired
of that one.

11:15.010 --> 11:16.954
That-that's funny,
but, uh, what about me?

11:17.400 --> 11:18.916
No, you don't have
a chance with her.

11:20.169 --> 11:22.003
She likes rich guys.

All right,
back to your, uh, heart.

11:26.575 --> 11:27.408
It's looking good.

11:27.410 --> 11:28.960
Uh, are you sure?

11:28.962 --> 11:31.012
Tests show you've had no damage.

11:31.014 --> 11:32.713
Your cholesterol looks normal.

11:32.715 --> 11:34.766
It's like the heart attack
never even happened.

11:35.017 --> 11:36.184
Oh.

11:36.186 --> 11:39.470
And you're not happy about that?

11:39.472 --> 11:40.888
No, I-I am.

11:40.890 --> 11:43.858
Um, uh, is this confidential,
what we're saying?

11:43.860 --> 11:45.926
Think of me as a priest.

11:47.029 --> 11:49.096
Except, when I touch your nuts,
it's strictly business.

11:50.399 --> 11:53.201
Okay, uh... uh, uh, here it is.

11:53.203 --> 11:55.453
Um, ever since the heart attack,

11:55.455 --> 11:58.122
uh, my life
has actually gotten better.

11:58.124 --> 11:59.714
Uh, my girlfriend,
my ex-wife,

11:59.715 --> 12:01.244
even my mother
have all been showering me

12:01.245 --> 12:02.304
with love and attention.

12:02.371 --> 12:04.289
Well, they were afraid
they were losing you.

12:04.482 --> 12:06.585
Have you ever had oral sex
and peach cobbler?

12:08.801 --> 12:10.618
At the same time?

12:12.638 --> 12:14.806
Can't say that I have.

12:14.808 --> 12:15.890
Well, I have.

12:15.904 --> 12:17.688
And once my girlfriend
finds out that I'm healthy,

12:17.694 --> 12:19.856
I'm back to sucking Life Savers
and humping my pillow.

12:21.847 --> 12:25.266
Well, as your doctor,
all I can tell you

12:25.268 --> 12:26.651
is you're
perfectly healthy.

12:26.653 --> 12:28.102
Can I get a second opinion?

12:28.637 --> 12:29.737
Yes, you're ugly, too.

12:32.691 --> 12:33.941
I joke.

12:33.943 --> 12:36.644
Uh, again, as your doctor,

12:36.646 --> 12:39.530
I have to tell you
you're in great shape.

12:39.832 --> 12:41.415
But, uh...

12:41.417 --> 12:44.202
as a guy who's banging
his receptionist,

12:44.204 --> 12:46.170
two pharmaceutical reps

12:46.172 --> 12:50.124
and, uh, on occasion,
his bloated, rich wife,

12:50.126 --> 12:52.176
let me add:

12:52.178 --> 12:53.861
Don't be a schmuck.

12:53.863 --> 12:56.163
Lie your ass off.

12:56.949 --> 12:58.766
Thanks, Doc.
That's good advice.

13:02.855 --> 13:04.689
Hmm.

13:07.609 --> 13:09.477
Jeanine, hi.

13:09.479 --> 13:12.063
Uh, listen, could you
run down to the deli

13:12.698 --> 13:14.232
and pick up a peach cobbler

13:14.234 --> 13:16.951
and meet me in exam room 2.

13:23.625 --> 13:25.459
How'd it go?

13:25.461 --> 13:26.494
Good news?

13:26.496 --> 13:28.579
It's bad, Mom.

13:28.581 --> 13:30.331
It's real bad.
Oh.

13:30.333 --> 13:33.384
Darling, I am so sorry.

13:33.386 --> 13:36.053
Hey, I know what
would cheer you up.

13:36.371 --> 13:38.306
So do I.

13:38.308 --> 13:40.725
No, I was thinking
I could take you shopping.

13:41.093 --> 13:41.893
Come on, now.

13:41.895 --> 13:42.989
There must be something
I can get you

13:42.990 --> 13:44.729
that would turn
that frown upside down.

13:46.148 --> 13:47.732
Well, uh, remember
when I was a kid

13:47.750 --> 13:49.084
how I always wanted
to be a cowboy?

13:50.769 --> 13:52.886
I'm not going to buy you
a horse, Alan.

13:53.272 --> 13:54.272
Of course not.

13:54.274 --> 13:57.575
Guess I'll just have to be
a cowboy in Heaven.

14:01.446 --> 14:02.896
Are your eyes closed?

14:03.398 --> 14:04.999
Yep, they're closed.

14:12.457 --> 14:14.241
Open.

14:18.714 --> 14:21.182
You must be kidding me.

14:21.184 --> 14:24.039
It's the safest way for Alan
to get up and down the stairs.

14:24.139 --> 14:26.461
Why does he have to get
up and down the stairs?

14:27.773 --> 14:29.440
So he can use my whirlpool tub.

14:29.442 --> 14:30.891
Oh, dear Lord.

14:30.893 --> 14:32.393
He needs it for his circulation.

14:32.458 --> 14:34.119
He said he's starting
to get bed sores.

14:34.212 --> 14:36.677
Then you tell him
to get out of bed.

14:36.846 --> 14:39.065
You don't build him
his own private escalator.

14:47.623 --> 14:49.758
Howdy, pardner.

14:52.027 --> 14:54.295
Ma'am.

14:54.297 --> 14:55.530
Wow.

14:55.532 --> 14:56.715
You look great.

14:56.717 --> 14:58.767
Just checking it
off my bucket list.

14:59.301 --> 15:00.418
What'd the doctor say?

15:00.420 --> 15:01.920
It's not good.

15:02.722 --> 15:05.090
I might have to have
a transplant.

15:06.642 --> 15:08.560
I'm sorry.

15:08.562 --> 15:10.478
Let's just hope that somewhere

15:10.480 --> 15:11.930
there's a baboon
with a healthy heart

15:11.981 --> 15:13.663
riding a motorcycle
without a helmet.

15:16.352 --> 15:18.052
For God's sake.

15:18.054 --> 15:20.021
Excuse me.
I'm going to take a whirlpool

15:20.656 --> 15:21.689
until my masseuse gets here.

15:22.208 --> 15:23.825
You got him a masseuse?

15:23.827 --> 15:26.277
It helps prevent blood clots.

15:26.279 --> 15:29.080
Yeah.

15:33.252 --> 15:35.537
My Uncle Fred
had a blood clot in his leg,

15:35.617 --> 15:36.547
and when I was little,
he took me

15:36.707 --> 15:39.155
to the Santa Monica Pier,
and we went on the Tilt-A-Whirl,

15:39.181 --> 15:42.230
and the centrifugal force
shot the clot into his brain.

15:43.879 --> 15:46.197
It was the worst birthday ever.

15:46.199 --> 15:49.300
He's seen a lot
of tragedy, Zoey.

15:49.302 --> 15:51.302
Be nice to him.

15:58.644 --> 16:00.612
Mmm.

16:00.614 --> 16:02.564
Too hard?

16:02.566 --> 16:04.932
Nah, dig in.
I like it rough.

16:05.767 --> 16:07.485
Brought your
banana smoothie.

16:07.487 --> 16:08.903
Oh, thank you, Zoey.

16:08.905 --> 16:10.438
Um, would you mind

16:10.440 --> 16:12.940
sticking the straw
in my donut hole?

16:13.942 --> 16:16.044
Oh, I would love to.

16:16.046 --> 16:17.778
Mmm.

16:17.780 --> 16:20.331
Tasty.

16:23.636 --> 16:26.954
I want you to listen
to me very carefully.

16:26.956 --> 16:29.674
You may have everyone
else around here fooled,

16:30.459 --> 16:32.793
but I know you're
full of crap.

16:32.795 --> 16:34.179
Beg pardon?

16:34.181 --> 16:35.680
What you do with
your family

16:35.783 --> 16:37.016
and your girlfriend
is your business,

16:37.315 --> 16:40.261
but I want you to stop
taking advantage of Walden.

16:40.361 --> 16:41.809
I-I don't know
what you're talking about.

16:41.810 --> 16:43.858
You know exactly what
I'm talking about.

16:43.859 --> 16:45.397
I-I'm sorry. I really
don't know what you're...

16:45.402 --> 16:47.153
You've been warned.

16:51.113 --> 16:53.198
Well, thanks for the...
the smoothie, Zoey.

16:56.286 --> 16:58.453
That bitch has got to go.

17:04.376 --> 17:05.792
How about that?

17:05.795 --> 17:08.329
Stars really are just like us.

17:09.548 --> 17:11.348
Alan.
Oh!

17:12.601 --> 17:13.768
Oh, my.

17:13.770 --> 17:14.969
Careful.

17:14.971 --> 17:17.355
You don't want
to give me a heart attack.

17:17.890 --> 17:18.790
We need to talk to you.

17:19.191 --> 17:20.608
Oh, yeah, sure.

17:23.112 --> 17:24.779
I'll be right back.

17:24.781 --> 17:27.699
Um, think I left
the tub running, so...

17:27.701 --> 17:29.350
Stop.

17:30.569 --> 17:33.854
Now, get out of that chair
and get down here.

17:34.690 --> 17:36.023
Okay.

17:36.025 --> 17:38.576
The queen has spoken.

17:43.449 --> 17:47.135
My legs are still
a little al dente.

17:48.888 --> 17:50.889
So...

17:50.891 --> 17:52.807
what up?

17:54.042 --> 17:56.561
I'll tell you "what up."

17:56.563 --> 17:59.380
I asked one of the private
investigators for my law firm

18:00.015 --> 18:01.432
to follow you for a few days.

18:01.717 --> 18:03.101
Really?

18:03.103 --> 18:05.987
Uh, uh, wh-which days
in particular?

18:05.989 --> 18:07.005
Well,

18:07.007 --> 18:09.073
