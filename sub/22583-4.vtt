WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:03.195
How much of the lab was destroyed?

00:03.195 --> 00:04.868
Nearly all of it.

00:04.868 --> 00:08.000
Three of my researchers were killed.

00:08.000 --> 00:09.985
And what of your work, Degra?

00:09.985 --> 00:12.896
I haven't been able to assess
how much data was lost.

00:12.896 --> 00:15.163
This will obviously delay us.

00:15.163 --> 00:18.915
How long?
Months, perhaps. I'm not certain.

00:18.915 --> 00:22.222
The humans have been moving through our space!

00:22.222 --> 00:24.275
They attacked a trellium mine.

00:24.275 --> 00:26.100
We cannot wait any longer.

00:26.100 --> 00:29.719
Think what you're asking me to do:

00:29.719 --> 00:34.223
Build a weapon to destroy an entire world.

00:34.223 --> 00:39.027
Do you understand how difficult, how dangerous this project is?

00:39.027 --> 00:43.942
Are you saying you're not up to the task?

00:43.942 --> 00:47.485
Dissension will solve nothing.

00:47.485 --> 00:50.606
We knew there could be setbacks.

00:50.606 --> 00:51.823
I agree.

00:51.823 --> 00:55.036
We are too far along to change our plan.

00:55.036 --> 00:57.354
Besides, we have no alternative.

00:57.354 --> 01:00.158
You know that isn't true.

01:00.158 --> 01:03.818
That option has been discussed and rejected.

01:03.818 --> 01:06.601
- Not by all of us.
- Perhaps it is time

01:06.601 --> 01:09.233
To reconsider our colleagues' proposal.

01:09.233 --> 01:12.163
We do not have enough information about the humans!

01:12.163 --> 01:14.674
That can be remedied.

01:14.674 --> 01:17.530
It's too dangerous.

01:17.530 --> 01:18.748
I agree.

01:18.748 --> 01:19.615
Eh!

01:19.615 --> 01:22.756
Degra deserves more time.

01:22.756 --> 01:27.801
But if we do not see some progress soon.

01:27.801 --> 01:31.925
We'll have no choice but to consider all our options.

01:34.109 --> 01:38.371
Song: "Faith of the Heart"
It's been a long road,

01:38.371 --> 01:41.892
Getting from there to here,

01:41.892 --> 01:45.594
It's been a long time,

01:45.594 --> 01:49.559
But my time is finally near,

01:49.559 --> 01:53.809
And I will see my dream come alive at last,

01:53.809 --> 01:57.352
I will touch the sky

01:57.352 --> 02:01.205
And they're not gonna hold me down no more,

02:01.205 --> 02:04.195
No they're not gonna change my mind,

02:04.195 --> 02:09.158
Cause I've got faith of the heart,

02:09.158 --> 02:11.958
I'm going where my heart will take me,

02:11.958 --> 02:17.035
I've got faith to believe,

02:17.035 --> 02:19.698
I can do anything,

02:19.698 --> 02:27.353
I've got strength of the soul,
But no one gonna bend or break me,

02:27.353 --> 02:33.141
I can reach, any star,

02:33.141 --> 02:37.075
I've got faith,

02:37.075 --> 02:44.874
I've got faith, faith of the heart.

02:51.837 --> 02:54.665
056 (3x04) Raijin

02:59.035 --> 03:01.719
Is that sufficient pressure?

03:01.719 --> 03:07.153
You could go a little harder.

03:07.153 --> 03:10.837
Perfect.

03:13.935 --> 03:15.554
Try that neck thing.

03:15.554 --> 03:17.824
- What do you call it?
- The Khavorta posture?

03:17.824 --> 03:20.190
- Yeah, that one.
- Are you certain?

03:20.190 --> 03:23.433
Don't worry, I've been practicing my breathing.

03:29.856 --> 03:33.317
You have been practicing.

03:36.032 --> 03:39.179
- T'Pol...
- Don't speak.

03:39.179 --> 03:43.785
Relax your jaw.

03:43.785 --> 03:46.937
Excellent.

03:48.084 --> 03:50.194
Now the surah'tahn.

03:51.721 --> 03:55.277
You know, I really need to talk to you about something.

03:55.277 --> 03:57.966
- Is there a problem?
- No, no, no, no.

03:57.966 --> 04:02.015
I mean, uh, this feels great,
and I really appreciate you taking the time,

04:02.015 --> 04:07.286
it's just... well, I'm not sure we should be doing it anymore.

04:07.286 --> 04:09.561
You said this was helping you sleep.

04:09.561 --> 04:10.658
Oh, it has.

04:10.658 --> 04:13.744
Then why do you want to stop?

04:13.744 --> 04:15.947
People are talking.

04:15.947 --> 04:21.562
About us, about...
me coming to your quarters at night.

04:21.562 --> 04:27.156
They think there's more going on than neuro-pressure.

04:27.156 --> 04:28.754
And that disturbs you?

04:28.754 --> 04:32.589
It shouldn't, I know, but...

04:32.589 --> 04:36.358
Malcolm and I were purging a clogged injector assembly last week

04:36.358 --> 04:41.213
and he asked me why I didn't just massage it with my magic fingers.

04:41.213 --> 04:44.372
I see no reason to be concerned with idle gossip.

04:44.372 --> 04:46.113
It doesn't bother you?

04:46.113 --> 04:47.884
We're both senior officers.

04:47.884 --> 04:50.322
If we were pursuing a romantic relationship,

04:50.322 --> 04:55.233
it wouldn't be Lieutenant Reed's concern, would it?

04:55.233 --> 05:00.051
- No, I suppose not.
- Shall we continue?

05:02.000 --> 05:08.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:50.630 --> 05:53.210
You've been scratching again.

05:53.210 --> 05:55.919
The itching kept me up all night.

05:55.919 --> 05:57.874
Have you been using the ointment I gave you?

05:57.874 --> 06:02.616
I tried, but the smell is a little strong.

06:02.616 --> 06:06.689
The more you scratch,
the longer it will take to heal.

06:09.452 --> 06:12.664
I understand you may have found a source of trellium-D.

06:12.664 --> 06:17.983
A V'radian chemist we met at the deuterium station claims he knows a way to synthesize it.

06:17.983 --> 06:19.651
I hope he's correct.

06:19.651 --> 06:25.318
Crewman Cutler broke her arm
when one of those spatial anomalies went through the exo-biology lab.

06:25.318 --> 06:27.343
The sooner the ship is insulated against these phenomena,

06:27.343 --> 06:29.181
the happier I will be.

06:29.181 --> 06:30.370
We're working on it, Doctor.

06:30.370 --> 06:31.991
Of course.

06:37.620 --> 06:41.028
Have you had any other symptoms?

06:41.028 --> 06:45.638
Just, um... dreams.

06:47.410 --> 06:55.555
I keep... seeing myself back at that... alien city.

06:56.817 --> 06:59.830
You were transformed into a different species.

06:59.830 --> 07:03.030
Don't expect to recover overnight.

07:44.879 --> 07:48.069
The chemist said his shop was on Barge 12.

08:08.755 --> 08:11.087
Phlox would have a field day here.

08:11.087 --> 08:14.760
Afraid we'll have to save the souvenir hunting for another time.

08:20.064 --> 08:21.440
I don't recognize your species.

08:21.440 --> 08:22.983
You must be newcomers. Welcome.

08:22.983 --> 08:24.186
Thank you.

08:24.186 --> 08:27.643
We're looking for Barge 12,
a chemist named B'Rat Ud.

08:27.643 --> 08:29.513
It would be a shame if I let you leave our world

08:29.513 --> 08:33.193
without introducing you to our local wildlife.

08:33.193 --> 08:35.202
That's not necessary.

08:35.202 --> 08:36.114
Xanthan marmots.

08:36.114 --> 08:38.827
They make wonderful pets,
and their flesh is quite succulent

08:38.827 --> 08:40.768
when prepared properly.

08:40.768 --> 08:42.460
No, thank you.

08:42.460 --> 08:47.145
Can you direct... direct us to the chemist?

08:47.145 --> 08:49.865
Barge 12 is that way, Tier Two.

09:03.589 --> 09:06.116
I am closed.

09:06.116 --> 09:08.823
I have an appointment.

09:10.926 --> 09:14.069
We met at the deuterium station on Norellus.

09:14.069 --> 09:16.809
You'll have to come back later.

09:16.809 --> 09:21.811
You said you could sell us the formula to synthesize trellium-D.

09:21.811 --> 09:25.105
I hope you didn't bring us all this way for nothing.

09:25.105 --> 09:28.726
Captain Archer, I remember now.

09:28.726 --> 09:30.011
How are you?

09:30.011 --> 09:31.517
A little pressed for time.

09:31.517 --> 09:34.007
Of course.

09:34.007 --> 09:39.041
Trellium-A is extremely common, easy to synthesize.

09:39.041 --> 09:44.542
But trellium-D is rare, difficult to process.

09:44.542 --> 09:46.656
And expensive?

09:46.656 --> 09:51.362
I'm confident we can agree on a fair price.

09:51.362 --> 09:53.464
I was thinking about you recently, Captain.

09:53.464 --> 09:57.204
You were very eager to learn about the Xindi, as I recall.

09:57.204 --> 10:01.015
What is your interest in them?

10:01.015 --> 10:03.167
We're on a diplomatic mission.

10:03.167 --> 10:06.795
A diplomatic mission.

10:06.795 --> 10:10.041
Some Xindi arrived here last week.

10:10.041 --> 10:12.815
I thought you might be interested.

10:12.815 --> 10:14.230
Where can we find them?

10:14.230 --> 10:16.620
They had business with anther merchant.

10:16.620 --> 10:17.591
Who?

10:17.591 --> 10:23.612
I'd be happy to direct you,
for a small fee.

10:23.612 --> 10:28.943
Commander Tucker has the list of supplies and equipment
we'd be willing to barter.

10:28.943 --> 10:31.761
As a gesture of good faith,
why don't you tell me where

10:31.761 --> 10:36.992
we can find this merchant,
then you and Mr. Tucker can work out the details.

10:36.992 --> 10:42.139
I'm confident we can agree on a fair price.

11:00.317 --> 11:06.814
To answer your first question,
I regret I cannot offer free samples.

11:06.814 --> 11:09.414
B'Rat Ud said you might be able to help us.

11:09.414 --> 11:11.824
I always welcome referrals.

11:11.824 --> 11:13.207
What is your pleasure?

11:13.207 --> 11:16.948
We were told you've recently done business with some Xindi.

11:16.948 --> 11:18.972
Excellent customers.

11:18.972 --> 11:22.217
They purchased two U'tani serpent women.

11:22.217 --> 11:29.278
I'm afraid I don't have any more,
but perhaps I could interest you in a Nuvian concubine.

11:29.278 --> 11:33.434
She's quite skilled.

11:33.434 --> 11:36.132
We're not interested.

11:36.132 --> 11:39.357
I want to know where I can find these Xindi.

11:39.357 --> 11:43.362
I believe they left orbit two days ago.

11:43.362 --> 11:45.039
Where were they heading?

11:45.039 --> 11:51.005
I wouldn't stay in business for very long
if I revealed confidential information about my clients.

11:51.005 --> 11:54.688
But I have females here from many worlds.

11:54.688 --> 11:57.287
Who knows?

11:57.287 --> 12:03.738
Perhaps one of them can tell you what you want to know about the Xindi.

12:25.375 --> 12:29.417
You have an excellent eye, my friend.

12:29.417 --> 12:33.026
She can be very accommodating.

12:39.739 --> 12:40.999
Archer.

12:40.999 --> 12:43.309
Captain, B'Rat and I have agreed on a price.

12:43.309 --> 12:45.328
I'll need to get back to the ship for his payment.

12:45.328 --> 12:47.783
Understood. We'll meet you back at the shuttlepod.

12:49.417 --> 12:54.965
How can you walk away from such beauty?

12:57.124 --> 12:58.811
Thanks for your time.

13:05.563 --> 13:09.596
After an hour in this place, I can't wait to get back to Decon.

13:25.904 --> 13:28.913
Take me with you, please!

13:29.750 --> 13:32.146
She seems determined to be sold today.

13:32.146 --> 13:35.630
Let's go back to my shop
and arrange for payment.

13:36.392 --> 13:37.725
I don't think so.

13:37.725 --> 13:39.665
Then I'll take my merchandise.

13:39.665 --> 13:42.192
Looks like she doesn't want to go with you.

13:42.192 --> 13:45.393
If you're so concerned about what she wants, buy her.

13:45.393 --> 13:48.650
Otherwise, stay out of my business!

14:23.159 --> 14:26.559
- Let's get out of here.
- Gladly.

14:39.541 --> 14:42.911
You have the most intriguing eyes.

14:42.911 --> 14:46.089
I've never seen a retinal structure this complex.

14:50.353 --> 14:52.209
How's our guest?

14:52.209 --> 14:59.567
I'm not familiar with her species,
but, uh, she appears to be in perfect health.

15:02.094 --> 15:08.692
I'm afraid I... don't even know your name.

15:08.692 --> 15:11.534
I'm called Rajiin.

15:11.534 --> 15:14.193
Very grateful for what you've done, Captain.

15:14.193 --> 15:17.310
I'll serve you well.
I promise.

15:19.310 --> 15:22.896
Let's get something straight.

15:22.896 --> 15:27.185
We don't believe one person can own another person.

15:27.185 --> 15:30.761
You are free to go wherever you'd like.

15:30.761 --> 15:33.657
How far is your homeworld?

15:33.657 --> 15:35.557
I don't know.

15:35.557 --> 15:41.160
I'm told it's called Oran'taku,
but I don't remember it.

15:41.160 --> 15:42.674
Do you have any family?

15:42.674 --> 15:45.752
I've had many owners.

15:47.681 --> 15:50.818
We have some data
on this region of space.

15:50.818 --> 15:55.441
I'll see if I can locate Oran'taku.

15:55.441 --> 15:58.101
If it's possible,
we'll take you there.

15:58.101 --> 15:59.987
Set her up in quarters.
Get her whatever she needs.

15:59.987 --> 16:01.339
Of course.

16:01.339 --> 16:05.998
Captain?
Thank you.

16:11.117 --> 16:17.023
On our planet... wars were fought over these.

16:17.023 --> 16:20.603
Mmm... ah...

16:25.002 --> 16:27.780
Careful.

16:35.635 --> 16:37.530
What's this one called?

16:37.530 --> 16:38.730
Black pepper.

16:38.730 --> 16:40.036
Ooh...

16:40.036 --> 16:41.700
There's paprika, mustard seed.

16:41.700 --> 16:43.880
I'm partial to the cayenne, myself.

16:43.880 --> 16:47.286
I'm sure you'll find these all very exotic.

16:47.286 --> 16:49.555
I believe you have something for us?

16:49.555 --> 16:52.028
Of course.

16:52.570 --> 16:56.793
I've reviewed your engineering specifications.

16:56.793 --> 17:01.895
You appear to have the necessary equipment
to produce liquid trellium-D.

17:01.895 --> 17:03.168
Liquid?

17:03.168 --> 17:07.505
Trellium can only be synthesized in a liquid state.

17:07.505 --> 17:10.719
It's just as effective as the natural ore.

17:10.719 --> 17:13.557
Then all we need is the recipe.

17:13.557 --> 17:16.135
Uh, there is one thing.

17:16.135 --> 17:21.075
Be sure to follow the protocols precisely.

17:21.075 --> 17:22.530
Or?

17:22.530 --> 17:31.013
Let's just say that in its liquid form,
trellium-D is extremely unstable.

17:31.013 --> 17:43.586
Mmm... Mmm! Ooh!

17:54.775 --> 17:57.843
How are your accommodations?

17:57.843 --> 18:00.794
Much better than I'm used to.

18:00.794 --> 18:04.481
The last ship I was on,
I never left the cargo hold...

18:04.481 --> 18:09.102
except for a few visits
to the captain's quarters.

18:11.664 --> 18:15.768
There are some restricted areas on Enterprise.

18:15.768 --> 18:18.495
Otherwise, feel free to look around.

18:18.495 --> 18:21.944
Your crew won't mind?

18:21.944 --> 18:24.662
I seriously doubt it.

18:26.254 --> 18:28.089
Are they all from Earth?

18:28.089 --> 18:29.564
Nearly all.

18:29.564 --> 18:30.769
You've met Dr. Phlox.

18:30.769 --> 18:32.671
He's from Denobula.

18:32.671 --> 18:36.214
And my First Officer's a Vulcan.

18:36.214 --> 18:40.236
Dr. Phlox mentioned you were
on an important mission.

18:40.236 --> 18:44.274
We're trying to make contact
with a species called Xindi.

18:44.274 --> 18:46.684
I don't suppose
you know anything about them?

18:46.684 --> 18:48.503
Very little.

18:48.503 --> 18:53.364
The two I saw looked reptilian,
and they weren't very pleasant.

18:53.364 --> 18:57.799
At the time, I was just relieved
they weren't interested in me.

18:57.799 --> 19:00.480
Why are you looking for them?

19:00.480 --> 19:03.665
We're hoping to resolve a disagreement.

19:03.665 --> 19:08.254
- Tucker to Captain Archer.
- Archer.

19:08.254 --> 19:10.394
We're in business, sir.

19:10.394 --> 19:13.101
I'll be right there.

19:13.101 --> 19:15.098
Excuse me.

19:18.811 --> 19:20.441
How unstable?

19:20.441 --> 19:23.562
Enough to do some serious damage
if we screw this up.

19:23.562 --> 19:26.176
And we're supposed to insulate
the entire ship with it?

19:26.176 --> 19:27.921
It's only volatile in its liquid form.

19:27.921 --> 19:31.693
Once we apply it to the inner hull and it sets,
it's completely safe.

19:31.693 --> 19:34.090
The tricky part's cooking it up in the first place.

19:34.090 --> 19:40.830
It'll require extremely precise calculations,
but I believe Mr. Tucker and I can synthesize the compound safely.

19:40.830 --> 19:41.663
Get started.

19:41.663 --> 19:48.149
I recommend we set up a lab on E-Deck
within the emergency bulkheads... as a precaution.

19:58.476 --> 20:00.014
Come in.

20:11.858 --> 20:14.038
Good evening, Captain.

20:14.038 --> 20:15.317
Is everything all right?

20:15.317 --> 20:17.166
I'm sorry to disturb you.

20:17.166 --> 20:19.991
I hoped you might have time to talk.

20:19.991 --> 20:21.796
Um...

20:21.796 --> 20:26.178
I'm not quite, uh...

20:26.178 --> 20:28.815
Please.

20:33.673 --> 20:35.673
I meant to speak with you earlier.

20:35.673 --> 20:37.359
We have some good news.

20:37.359 --> 20:41.680
T'Pol was able to locate your home planet in a database we acquired.

20:41.680 --> 20:44.370
It's only two days away.

20:46.481 --> 20:49.689
You don't seem very pleased.

20:49.689 --> 20:53.454
I was taken away
when I was very young.

20:53.454 --> 20:56.417
I don't remember much about it.

20:56.417 --> 21:00.777
And I doubt anyone there would remember me.

21:00.777 --> 21:03.159
You never know.

21:03.159 --> 21:08.290
You seem very memorable to me.

21:08.290 --> 21:13.546
I'm very grateful for what you've done, Captain.

21:13.546 --> 21:16.643
I want to repay you for your kindness.

21:16.643 --> 21:18.403
That isn't necessary.

21:18.403 --> 21:21.194
I know.

21:21.194 --> 21:22.817
Rajiin, you...

21:22.817 --> 21:23.712
There's a reason

21:23.712 --> 21:27.239
I was taken from my home.

21:27.239 --> 21:30.444
I have certain... gifts.

21:30.444 --> 21:33.623
Would you like me to show you?

21:34.496 --> 21:39.947
That... really isn't something that...

21:43.909 --> 21:46.332
It's all right.

22:20.336 --> 22:22.371
Captain?

22:22.371 --> 22:25.740
Is something wrong?

22:25.740 --> 22:28.174
No.

22:28.174 --> 22:32.224
Well, I just wanted to say thank you again.

22:32.752 --> 22:36.456
We'll be leaving orbit soon.

22:36.456 --> 22:40.700
- Good night
- Good night

22:52.085 --> 22:53.345
What's the molecular pressure?

22:53.345 --> 22:55.327
Up to 1,100 units.

22:55.327 --> 22:57.322
Boy, this stuff is tricky.

22:58.245 --> 23:02.912
Decrease the theta bombardment
by six... no, seven percent.

23:03.826 --> 23:07.028
Pressure's still rising: 1,400 units...

23:07.028 --> 23:08.957
1,430.

23:08.957 --> 23:11.013
Damn it.

23:11.013 --> 23:14.426
Kill the theta radiation all together.

23:15.882 --> 23:18.055
No effect.

23:18.055 --> 23:19.874
We should seal off this section and leave.

23:19.874 --> 23:22.753
A sustained burst of delta radiation might do the trick.

23:22.753 --> 23:23.896
And it might not.

23:23.896 --> 23:25.524
We should evacuate.

23:25.524 --> 23:28.443
I'm going to ramp the delta to 80%.

23:30.099 --> 23:31.604
It's not working.

23:31.604 --> 23:32.800
Well, you're welcome to leave.

23:32.800 --> 23:35.491
The pressure is up to 2,000 units.

23:35.491 --> 23:38.526
Commander!

23:52.454 --> 23:56.425
Some of our calculations may have been slightly off.

23:56.425 --> 23:59.171
We're back to square one.

24:01.156 --> 24:05.099
We've been working for six hours.
I suggest we take a break.

24:05.099 --> 24:07.197
I can't argue with that.

24:07.197 --> 24:08.952
Come to my quarters in half an hour.

24:08.952 --> 24:10.995
We'll resume your neural pressure regimen.

24:10.995 --> 24:12.235
I'll be fine.

24:12.235 --> 24:16.027
I'd prefer you were rested before we make another attempt.

24:39.688 --> 24:41.860
Can I help you?

24:42.737 --> 24:45.633
The captain said it was all right if I left my quarters.

24:45.633 --> 24:46.676
I'm Rajiin.

24:46.676 --> 24:48.343
I know.

24:48.343 --> 24:53.195
News travels fast on a starship.
I'm Ensign Hoshi Sato.

24:53.195 --> 24:56.736
It's a pleasure to meet you.

24:57.889 --> 25:02.256
I was looking for the mess hall.

25:02.256 --> 25:05.321
I just happen to be going that way.

25:10.192 --> 25:12.456
What's your job here?

25:12.456 --> 25:15.314
I'm the ship's communications officer.

25:15.314 --> 25:19.232
I see.

25:19.232 --> 25:26.856
I'd love to hear your language.

25:26.856 --> 25:29.989
Actually, I speak quite a few.

25:50.540 --> 25:53.386
You must be T'Pol.

26:00.040 --> 26:04.252
- My name is Rajiin.
- I know who you are.

26:04.252 --> 26:06.778
What are you doing here?

26:06.778 --> 26:09.148
Your door was unlocked.

26:09.148 --> 26:11.103
That's not likely.

26:11.103 --> 26:14.929
I was hoping we'd have a chance to talk.

26:14.929 --> 26:17.893
Perhaps you are unfamiliar with our protocols,

26:17.893 --> 26:22.230
but it is unacceptable
for you to be in my quarters uninvited.

26:22.230 --> 26:26.151
I didn't think you'd mind.

26:26.151 --> 26:30.836
I'm afraid...  You're a Vulcan...
on a ship filled with humans.

26:30.836 --> 26:34.005
Why?

26:34.005 --> 26:38.913
Vulcans and humans are allies.

26:38.913 --> 26:43.225
Now please leave.

26:43.225 --> 26:47.988
- What are you doing?
- Don't resist.

26:47.988 --> 26:50.604
I need you to leave.

26:50.604 --> 26:54.407
You have a disciplined mind.

26:54.407 --> 26:57.853
You're in such control of your emotions.

26:57.853 --> 27:03.074
Try to let go.

27:03.074 --> 27:05.779
Better.

27:20.761 --> 27:22.763
Stop.

27:22.763 --> 27:25.918
Let go.

27:54.208 --> 27:55.585
No.

27:55.585 --> 27:57.870
No!

27:57.870 --> 28:00.585
- Tucker to the bridge.
- Go ahead.

28:00.585 --> 28:03.304
Could you tell me where T'Pol is?

28:03.304 --> 28:05.899
She's in her quarters, sir.

28:30.694 --> 28:33.319
Tucker to Security.

28:34.947 --> 28:36.301
I need assistance.

28:36.301 --> 28:37.350
Were you successful?

28:37.350 --> 28:38.783
I have what you want.

28:38.783 --> 28:42.738
I can use their transporter device,
but you'll need to be within 10,000 kilometers.

28:42.738 --> 28:44.739
Signal us when you're ready.

28:49.411 --> 28:51.407
Is there something wrong?

28:51.407 --> 28:53.782
The captain would like to see you.

28:53.782 --> 28:57.520
There's no need to bother the captain.

28:57.520 --> 28:59.838
I have my orders.

28:59.838 --> 29:01.271
So do I.

30:17.556 --> 30:19.984
Are you in range?

30:19.984 --> 30:22.554
Respond!

30:23.455 --> 30:26.206
Leaving so soon?

30:32.440 --> 30:33.835
We jammed your signal.

30:33.835 --> 30:36.889
Your friends can't hear you.

30:36.889 --> 30:40.803
Who are they?

30:47.932 --> 30:51.198
Take her to the brig.

30:55.912 --> 30:57.880
You should let me run a neuro-scan.

30:57.880 --> 30:59.825
I'll be fine.

30:59.825 --> 31:01.435
What happened to her?

31:01.435 --> 31:03.344
I can't even begin to speculate.

31:03.344 --> 31:06.074
She's suffered disruptions throughout her neo-cortex.

31:06.074 --> 31:08.481
If she were human, or Denobulan for that matter,

31:08.481 --> 31:09.728
she'd probably be dead.

31:09.728 --> 31:14.819
But Vulcan neurophysiology
is a great deal more resilient than ours.

31:14.819 --> 31:16.531
I want to talk to her.

31:16.531 --> 31:18.558
I have to finish treating her injuries first.

31:18.558 --> 31:19.924
How long?

31:19.924 --> 31:22.465
A few hours.

31:30.702 --> 31:32.699
Have Phlox take a look at your head.

31:48.984 --> 31:51.662
Who were you trying to contact?

31:51.662 --> 31:52.486
I'm sorry.

31:52.486 --> 31:53.501
I asked you a question.

31:53.501 --> 31:55.449
I can't answer it.

31:58.945 --> 32:00.862
What did you do to T'Pol?

32:00.862 --> 32:03.208
She shouldn't have resisted.

32:04.784 --> 32:06.388
Who are you?

32:06.388 --> 32:09.161
I told you, my name is Rajiin.

32:09.161 --> 32:11.239
That's right.

32:11.239 --> 32:15.882
Kidnapped when you were a child, sold into a life of slavery.

32:15.882 --> 32:21.169
And it was just a coincidence
that you happened to escape when I was at that market.

32:22.072 --> 32:24.739
That chemist knew I was looking for information about the Xindi.

32:24.739 --> 32:27.992
Is that why you showed up so conveniently?

32:27.992 --> 32:32.540
The only thing I can tell you,
is that you're in danger.

32:32.540 --> 32:34.943
Care to be a little more specific?

32:34.943 --> 32:39.548
If I say anything else,
they'll kill me.

32:39.548 --> 32:41.582
Who?

32:41.582 --> 32:45.355
The Xindi?

32:45.355 --> 32:49.086
How do you know
I won't do the same?

32:53.114 --> 32:56.733
It's true that I deceived you.

32:56.733 --> 33:01.174
That didn't make your decision
to help me any less admirable.

33:01.174 --> 33:04.875
I don't want to see you harmed, Captain.

33:04.875 --> 33:09.971
The best thing for you to do is let me go.

33:09.971 --> 33:14.079
Tell me who you contacted.

33:14.079 --> 33:16.150
Who?!

33:16.150 --> 33:26.112
Bridge to Captain Archer.

33:26.112 --> 33:27.149
Go ahead.

33:27.149 --> 33:29.207
Two vessels are approaching from aft.

33:29.207 --> 33:34.660
Sir... their bio-signs match the genetic profile of the Xindi pilot who attacked Earth.

33:34.660 --> 33:37.695
Hull plating to full power,
stand by weapons.

33:40.518 --> 33:42.929
The reptilian species.

33:42.929 --> 33:47.175
They're the ones who sent you.

33:48.420 --> 33:50.727
I had no choice.

34:01.863 --> 34:04.999
We're dropping out of warp.

34:14.811 --> 34:19.416
I assume they're here for you.

34:19.416 --> 34:23.286
They won't harm anyone if you let me go.

34:23.286 --> 34:25.696
Forgive me if I don't take your word on that,

34:25.696 --> 34:28.547
but they murdered seven million people on my planet.

34:29.802 --> 34:32.429
Bridge to the captain.

34:33.239 --> 34:34.101
Go ahead.

34:34.101 --> 34:36.739
The smaller ship is approaching
the starboard docking port.

34:36.739 --> 34:40.739
Seal that airlock and post security teams.
I'm on my way.

34:44.706 --> 34:48.446
What was your mission?

34:52.784 --> 34:55.199
They wanted information.

34:55.199 --> 34:57.846
About what?

34:57.846 --> 35:00.788
About you.

35:00.788 --> 35:05.085
- They're building a weapon.
- We know that.

35:05.085 --> 35:07.401
This is different.

35:07.401 --> 35:10.476
A bioweapon.

35:10.476 --> 35:12.951
Go on.

35:12.951 --> 35:17.764
They need data about your species
before they can begin.

35:17.764 --> 35:21.721
- Where are they building the weapon?
- I don't know.

35:21.721 --> 35:26.369
- When will it be ready?!
- I don't know.

35:28.993 --> 35:32.380
They didn't tell me anything else!

35:33.537 --> 35:35.895
Get a security detail down here.

35:35.895 --> 35:40.048
No one's taking her anywhere.

36:08.070 --> 36:09.376
Fall back!

36:37.506 --> 36:40.235
Three boarding parties, at least five men each.

36:40.235 --> 36:43.918
They're heading for the brig.
Try to cut them off.

36:43.918 --> 36:45.735
You're with me.

38:44.812 --> 38:46.516
- Archer to the bridge.
- Go ahead.

38:46.516 --> 38:48.981
Don't let those ships get away.
Lay in a pursuit course.

38:48.981 --> 38:50.456
Aye, sir.

39:02.839 --> 39:05.012
He's dead, sir.

39:05.012 --> 39:09.803
Captain, those ships just entered some kind of... vortex.

39:09.803 --> 39:11.174
They're gone.

39:21.342 --> 39:26.162
This gland released a fatal dose of neurotoxin into his bloodstream.

39:26.162 --> 39:29.101
What kind of species is born with a suicide gland?

39:29.101 --> 39:30.029
Not this one.

39:30.029 --> 39:31.564
He was surgically enhanced...

39:31.564 --> 39:34.078
if you can call it an enhancement.

39:34.078 --> 39:36.842
I want a complete autopsy, Doctor.

39:36.842 --> 39:40.154
And have Malcolm take this weapon apart.

39:40.154 --> 39:44.407
I want to find out its range, power output
and how we can defend against it.

39:44.407 --> 39:46.724
Aye, sir.

39:49.385 --> 39:52.120
Are you okay?

39:52.120 --> 39:53.000
Yes.

39:53.000 --> 39:57.551
Good, because I want an analysis of the scans
we took of those Xindi ships

39:57.551 --> 40:00.297
and find out what you can about that vortex they went through.

40:00.297 --> 40:03.010
I don't want them dropping in unannounced again.

40:03.010 --> 40:05.388
Dismissed.

40:13.661 --> 40:16.780
You put all of our work at risk.

40:16.780 --> 40:18.976
And exposed us to the humans.

40:18.976 --> 40:21.147
Allowed one of our soldiers to be captured.

40:21.147 --> 40:23.237
Ah, he wasn't taken alive.

40:23.237 --> 40:25.614
You agreed to give me more time.

40:25.614 --> 40:29.850
You don't have enough data
to construct the bioweapon.

40:29.850 --> 40:32.364
Don't we?

40:33.722 --> 40:35.780
Bring her!

40:43.561 --> 40:50.318
Show them.
Show them!

41:04.576 --> 41:14.634
We couldn't pursue the bioweapon
because we didn't have enough information about the humans.

41:14.634 --> 41:16.873
Now we do.

41:16.873 --> 41:19.837
We must proceed both fronts!

41:19.837 --> 41:26.070

41:26.070 --> 41:29.260

41:29.260 --> 41:33.265
There's more to these humans you can learn from a set of biometric scans.

41:33.265 --> 41:35.622
That's enough!

41:35.622 --> 41:37.604
Take her!

41:38.305 --> 41:44.319
