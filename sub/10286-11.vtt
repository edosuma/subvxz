WEBVTT

00:03.407 --> 00:05.967
Quit playing with the knobs.

00:06.310 --> 00:10.337
I'm not playing, I just can't stand to look
at a picture that's not properly adjusted.

00:11.381 --> 00:13.110
It's too green.

00:13.984 --> 00:15.542
It's too green.

00:18.755 --> 00:20.450
Perfect.

00:20.624 --> 00:22.251
I just cannot believe it!

00:22.426 --> 00:25.953
The judge is gonna be on a TV talk show.
Isn't this exciting?

00:26.129 --> 00:29.759
Yeah, lash me to the sofa.

00:30.335 --> 00:31.768
What is that?

00:31.936 --> 00:36.373
That is Jennifer Black, one of the biggest
rock stars around.

00:36.541 --> 00:40.671
- You don't say. What's she done?
- Her big hit was "Suicide Hayride."

00:41.713 --> 00:45.581
<i>Yes, based on a theme from
Beethoven's Appassionata, I believe.</i>

00:45.750 --> 00:47.684
I didn't know that.

00:47.952 --> 00:51.854
Yes, it's a fact. Many of our most modern,
popular songs are based on the classics.

00:52.023 --> 00:53.388
- Dan.
- "Wichita Lineman."

00:53.558 --> 00:55.526
<i>Wagner's Die Götterdämmerung.</i>

00:56.361 --> 00:57.589
Come in.

00:58.997 --> 01:01.522
I'm looking for Judge Harold T. Stone.

01:01.699 --> 01:04.532
Oh, sorry, you missed him.
He left about a half an hour ago.

01:04.702 --> 01:08.365
He had to hurry across town. He's gonna
be on this TV program in a few minutes.

01:08.540 --> 01:10.007
Who gives a flying...

01:13.244 --> 01:14.643
Any of us help you?

01:14.812 --> 01:18.509
No. His court clerk is sick,
and I'm filling in for her tomorrow.

01:18.684 --> 01:21.482
Well, welcome. I'm Liz Williams.

01:21.654 --> 01:24.919
- This is Dan Fielding.
- Forget it. I'm just a temporary.

01:25.090 --> 01:27.183
If I know your names,
we might become friends.

01:27.359 --> 01:29.827
If we become friends,
I'll grieve for you if you die.

01:29.995 --> 01:33.692
For a lousy couple of days?
It's not worth the pain.

01:33.866 --> 01:35.663
See you tomorrow.

01:38.971 --> 01:41.701
- That's a strange lady.
- Yeah.

01:42.174 --> 01:47.043
- Nice outfit, though.
- Look. I think it's time for Harry.

01:49.048 --> 01:50.948
<i>The singer, Jennifer Black.</i>

01:51.116 --> 01:55.314
<i>The album, I Bite the Songs.</i>

01:55.921 --> 01:58.048
Jennifer, it's been wonderful
having you here.

01:58.223 --> 01:59.588
And if you can stick around...

01:59.758 --> 02:01.953
...l'd love you to meet my next guest.
- Sure.

02:02.127 --> 02:03.992
He is one of New York's newest judges...

02:04.163 --> 02:06.791
...and one of the youngest men ever
to hold such a post.

02:06.966 --> 02:08.627
Let's make him feel right at home.

02:08.801 --> 02:11.464
The honorable, Harold T. Stone.

02:14.507 --> 02:17.476
Welcome. Welcome.

02:18.378 --> 02:20.346
- Thanks.
- So, what do we call you?

02:20.513 --> 02:22.037
- Your Honor?
- Harry's fine.

02:22.215 --> 02:25.343
- Harry, please say hello to Jennifer Black.
- Hi.

02:25.518 --> 02:29.079
Hey, nifty outfit. Boy, that must make
a lot of noise in the dryer, huh?

02:31.825 --> 02:35.955
- So, Harry, being one of New York's...
- You know, this set looks bigger on TV.

02:36.129 --> 02:39.963
It's that little lens out there.
Optical illusion, that sort of thing. Anyway...

02:40.133 --> 02:43.591
You know, this is the first time
I ever wore makeup.

02:43.770 --> 02:46.534
Looks like I'm losing control around here.

02:46.706 --> 02:51.109
Let's find out if I gain control back
after this short commercial break.

02:51.745 --> 02:54.111
Charlie, who the hell booked this show?

02:54.614 --> 02:57.014
- You're funny.
- Well, everybody says so.

02:57.183 --> 02:58.514
Are you a fan of mine?

03:00.421 --> 03:03.151
Well, I guess you'd say my tastes
are more traditional.

03:03.324 --> 03:04.951
Mel Tormé is my favorite.

03:05.126 --> 03:07.651
- Me too.
- No kidding.

03:07.828 --> 03:10.194
- I love him.
- This is the same Jennifer Black...

03:10.364 --> 03:13.197
...who wrote "Society of Scum"?

03:13.501 --> 03:17.301
I don't know, but why don't we find out
over coffee, after the show?

03:17.905 --> 03:20.100
Coffee with Jennifer Black, superstar?

03:20.541 --> 03:22.236
No. With me.

03:23.544 --> 03:25.409
- Sure.
- Tell him I don't want any more...

03:25.579 --> 03:29.572
...child actors on the show. Last night, that
little creep upstaged me the moment she...

03:29.750 --> 03:32.548
Thank you. Thank you very much.

03:32.720 --> 03:35.382
We're back talking right now
with singer Jennifer Black...

03:35.556 --> 03:37.888
...and New York judge, Harold T. Stone...

03:39.326 --> 03:41.590
...is doing the same.

04:34.449 --> 04:36.576
Excuse me. Who are you?

04:36.752 --> 04:39.381
Mavis Tuttle, your temporary court clerk.

04:39.689 --> 04:42.715
Well, nice to meet you, Miss...

04:42.892 --> 04:44.257
Is it Miss or Mrs. Tuttle?

04:44.761 --> 04:47.389
My old man's dead. Take your pick.

04:49.298 --> 04:51.994
He turned out to be a temporary too.

04:53.903 --> 04:55.495
Bye.

04:57.306 --> 05:00.901
There he is. The most famous judge
in New York City.

05:01.077 --> 05:02.339
Hi, guys.

05:02.945 --> 05:04.572
Tell us all about it.

05:04.747 --> 05:07.307
Well, not much to tell.
Apparently, you saw the show.

05:07.483 --> 05:11.385
We saw the show. We wanna know
about after the show, with Jennifer.

05:11.621 --> 05:12.849
How'd you know about that?

05:13.022 --> 05:16.651
Your Honor, everybody knows about that.

05:17.059 --> 05:21.257
Cute headline, don't you think?
"Rocker Tries Judge."

05:21.430 --> 05:24.024
The photographers followed us
right into the coffee shop.

05:24.300 --> 05:27.269
That's me. That's my pie.

05:28.805 --> 05:30.831
So, how was she?

05:31.008 --> 05:33.704
- Dan.
- I meant personality-wise.

05:33.877 --> 05:36.402
Did she attempt any multi-syllable words
or anything?

05:36.713 --> 05:39.443
Actually, she's quite literate
and very expressive.

05:40.184 --> 05:42.982
- Say no more. Say no more.
- Dan.

05:43.420 --> 05:45.888
Really, she's a terrific person.
I like her very much.

05:46.056 --> 05:50.152
You and 50 million other fans, half of whom
are in our courtroom tonight.

05:50.327 --> 05:53.194
- What?
- Yeah. Take a little peek.

05:57.067 --> 05:59.001
- Harry!
- Harry!

06:01.004 --> 06:03.564
- What are they doing here?
- They came here to see you...

06:03.740 --> 06:06.140
...and they think Jennifer
may show up here tonight.

06:06.310 --> 06:08.278
She will. We're having dinner after court.

06:08.445 --> 06:09.673
You're kidding.

06:09.847 --> 06:12.213
Can I talk to her, please?
Just for a minute?

06:12.382 --> 06:14.145
I've never met anybody
famous before...

06:14.318 --> 06:16.309
...who hasn't been connected
with a slaying.

06:16.486 --> 06:19.650
Yeah, whatever you want. Excuse me.
I gotta get ready for court.

06:19.824 --> 06:22.292
I'm so excited. I'm gonna meet
Jennifer Black.

06:22.460 --> 06:26.794
Yeah, I know how you feel.
I once met Donald Rumsfeld.

06:27.966 --> 06:29.456
It was at a fundraiser.

06:29.634 --> 06:32.159
He told me this hilarious story
about a caucus fight...

06:32.337 --> 06:35.204
...over this land management
bureau issue.

06:37.041 --> 06:40.408
Wait up. This is gonna kill you.

06:41.880 --> 06:43.472
Come in.

06:44.082 --> 06:45.777
Guess who.

06:46.651 --> 06:49.415
Well, if it isn't my favorite
yellow journalist.

06:49.587 --> 06:52.112
- You're too kind.
- What is it, Craven?

06:52.290 --> 06:57.091
What is it? Jennifer Black is it,
and you are its current lover.

06:57.262 --> 06:59.696
Craven, we met briefly,
we had coffee...

06:59.864 --> 07:01.764
...and then I took her back to her hotel.

07:02.066 --> 07:03.431
How does she take it?

07:03.601 --> 07:05.762
- I beg your pardon?
- Her coffee.

07:05.937 --> 07:07.905
My public likes to know
that kind of stuff.

07:08.072 --> 07:12.009
Your public moves their lips
when they read.

07:12.344 --> 07:13.971
Your Honor, come on, huh?

07:14.146 --> 07:19.140
I figured you'd give me the inside story
because of our close, personal relationship.

07:19.518 --> 07:21.748
Craven, our close, personal relationship...

07:21.921 --> 07:24.719
...is that of a tick to a dog.

07:26.025 --> 07:28.357
Tick, right?

07:29.161 --> 07:30.685
Yeah.

07:30.863 --> 07:32.125
We're ready, Your Honor.

07:32.298 --> 07:34.789
- Thanks, Bull. I'll be right out.
- Fine.

07:35.734 --> 07:40.228
Want me to take out the trash
while I'm here, Your Honor?

07:42.308 --> 07:46.768
Hey, come on, big guy.
Sticks and stones, remember?

07:46.946 --> 07:48.345
Sticks?

07:48.514 --> 07:51.813
I don't need no stinking sticks.

07:54.386 --> 07:55.853
Well.

08:08.768 --> 08:10.167
Hey, man.

08:11.571 --> 08:13.596
I dig your skull choice.

08:16.009 --> 08:19.240
Personally, I was torn between shaving
and this.

08:21.147 --> 08:23.638
You lost.

08:25.085 --> 08:27.553
Hey, man. You know this judge?

08:29.489 --> 08:32.356
Hey, woman. Yes, I do.

08:32.525 --> 08:34.823
Listen, you think you can get me
his autograph?

08:35.428 --> 08:38.419
You want the autograph
of an arraignment court judge?

08:38.865 --> 08:40.799
Come on, mister.

08:40.967 --> 08:44.265
- I'll give you five bucks.
- Get lost.

08:46.840 --> 08:50.402
Ten, and I'll throw in one of his pens.

08:50.578 --> 08:51.806
All rise.

09:07.561 --> 09:10.655
Criminal court, part two,
City of New York, is now in session.

09:10.831 --> 09:13.299
The honorable Harold T. Stone presiding.

09:16.637 --> 09:17.865
Harry!

09:22.243 --> 09:23.471
Quiet, please.

09:25.913 --> 09:27.471
Thank you. Thank you very much.

09:39.594 --> 09:41.289
Thanks, Bull.

09:43.999 --> 09:46.092
Now, I know why many of you
are here tonight...

09:46.268 --> 09:49.431
First case. Maynard Dressel,
second-degree burglary.

09:49.604 --> 09:52.630
I've read the report, and if you ask me,
the little weasel did it.

09:52.808 --> 09:55.368
Miss Tuttle, I am addressing the court.

09:55.544 --> 09:58.536
It's been my experience
that acknowledging the unruly...

09:58.713 --> 10:00.908
...only encourages their behavior.

10:01.083 --> 10:03.745
I appreciate the advice,
but this is my courtroom.

10:03.919 --> 10:06.444
And you're gonna do
whatever the hell you want.

10:06.621 --> 10:09.385
Fine. I'll just stroll on over there
to my hole...

10:09.558 --> 10:13.392
...and shuffle some papers
till you're done.

10:14.062 --> 10:16.462
As I was saying,
I know that many of you are here...

10:16.631 --> 10:19.691
...because some papers ran a picture of me
with Jennifer Black.

10:19.868 --> 10:21.802
Harry, I love you!

10:25.073 --> 10:27.940
I love you, Harry,
I wanna touch you, I want...

10:28.110 --> 10:30.773
Wait a minute, I gotta get close to Harry.

10:30.947 --> 10:34.110
- Will the court officers remove her, please.
- Oh, Harry!

10:34.283 --> 10:37.650
Was it worth it, just to save
a lousy sawbuck?

10:38.321 --> 10:42.485
All right, people, listen up!
Now, I wanna make a few things clear.

10:42.725 --> 10:43.953
This is a courtroom.

10:44.527 --> 10:46.256
This is a courtroom.

10:46.429 --> 10:48.897
- Not a circus.
- Not a...

10:49.365 --> 10:50.889
Circus.

10:51.534 --> 10:52.967
Not a circus.

10:53.136 --> 10:55.229
Now, I know you've... l...

10:57.039 --> 10:58.529
Now, come on. Stop that.

10:58.875 --> 11:00.137
Stop it.

11:00.309 --> 11:01.970
You'll get Bull riled up.

11:07.984 --> 11:11.977
Now, if there's one more such outburst,
I will clear this entire courtroom.

11:12.388 --> 11:16.324
Listen, everybody.
Jennifer Black's in the building!

11:24.768 --> 11:27.635
Do I make myself clear?

11:33.277 --> 11:36.576
Yes, sergeant. Yeah, sergeant.
Thank you.

11:36.914 --> 11:41.214
The police have cordoned off the building.
They're not letting anyone else in.

11:41.451 --> 11:42.941
- So how many...?
- Got in?

11:43.120 --> 11:45.884
There's a couple of hundred
roaming around the building.

11:46.056 --> 11:50.686
Thank God they're sealed in here with us,
and not on the streets terrorizing the public.

11:50.961 --> 11:52.189
Kind of scary, isn't it?

11:52.362 --> 11:54.922
How disruptive worship
and adulation can be.

11:55.599 --> 11:58.898
Your Honor. You know,
we can't work like this.

11:59.069 --> 12:02.937
- Yeah, I know.
- I bet she's a very nice girl.

12:03.106 --> 12:04.767
Oh, she's very nice.

12:04.942 --> 12:08.139
- But this craziness isn't gonna stop unless...
- Last night she said...

12:08.312 --> 12:10.474
...that I reminded her of a puppy dog.

12:10.748 --> 12:12.272
Cut her loose.

12:12.684 --> 12:15.744
She said my eyes flickered
like candles in a pumpkin.

12:15.920 --> 12:17.547
Cut her loose tonight.

12:17.722 --> 12:21.988
She said I had the subtle sensuality
of a caged panther.

12:22.794 --> 12:26.025
Okay, you let it ride till breakfast.

12:27.165 --> 12:30.157
Harry. Harry, are you all right?

12:31.336 --> 12:32.735
I can't see her anymore.

12:32.971 --> 12:35.371
- Right.
- I like her.

12:35.840 --> 12:37.068
Right.

12:37.308 --> 12:39.833
I like her, so I can't see her anymore.

12:40.445 --> 12:43.778
And they called it the birth of the blues.

12:44.515 --> 12:45.982
Right.

12:46.517 --> 12:49.179
- Hi.
- Selma, how's it going out there?

12:49.354 --> 12:53.256
Now I remember why
I didn't have children.

12:53.858 --> 12:55.621
Yeah, who is it?

12:56.394 --> 12:58.328
Bull.

12:58.496 --> 13:00.055
Friend.

13:02.134 --> 13:05.467
- Peekaboo.
- Jennifer. You're early.

13:05.638 --> 13:09.005
I know. I thought I'd hang around
for a while and watch you work.

13:09.174 --> 13:10.607
That's what the problem is.

13:10.876 --> 13:13.936
- What what problem is?
- I'll just stand guard outside your door.

13:14.113 --> 13:16.707
- Thanks, Bull.
- May I?

13:16.882 --> 13:18.850
- Thanks, Bull.
- "Thanks, Bull. Thanks, Bull."

13:19.018 --> 13:21.384
That's all I ever hear around here.

13:22.855 --> 13:24.379
Thanks, Bull.

13:26.592 --> 13:29.288
Jennifer Black, may I introduce
Liz Williams, legal aid.

13:29.461 --> 13:32.487
- Hi. I'm a big fan.
- Thank you.

13:32.665 --> 13:34.860
And Dan Fielding,
assistant district attorney.

13:35.034 --> 13:36.899
Hi. I had no idea how beautiful you are.

13:37.069 --> 13:38.798
Harry, you've been holding out on us.

13:38.971 --> 13:41.804
When I saw you on the tube,
in that getup, I didn't see your...

13:41.974 --> 13:46.070
Listen, the "assistant" in front of "district
attorney" is not what it sounds like.

13:46.345 --> 13:49.906
- Nice meeting you.
- Did you really gross $8 million last year?

13:50.083 --> 13:53.780
Jennifer, the gang just wanted to say hi,
but now they've gotta be moving along.

13:53.953 --> 13:57.116
Yeah, Jennifer, I'm a really big fan,
and I've got every...

13:57.290 --> 13:59.758
...intention of buying
some of your albums.

13:59.926 --> 14:01.860
Pleased to meet you.

14:02.929 --> 14:04.794
Say, perhaps you could give the judge...

14:04.964 --> 14:08.798
...an autographed picture for my niece.
She thinks you're... I'm lying. It's for me.

14:08.968 --> 14:12.665
"To my friend Liz," or something like that.
Thanks. Okay, bye.

14:15.342 --> 14:18.334
- Jennifer Black, Selma Hacker.
- Nice meeting you.

14:18.511 --> 14:19.944
Same here.

14:20.113 --> 14:23.947
If you ever bump into Jerry Vale...

14:24.117 --> 14:26.551
...tell him we're waiting.

14:33.126 --> 14:37.392
Well. Alone at last.

14:39.199 --> 14:40.462
Not quite.

14:42.703 --> 14:45.035
Hey. Hey. Get down from there.

14:45.206 --> 14:49.142
You fool, this is the 18th floor.
Get down.

14:49.310 --> 14:51.778
Get down!

14:51.946 --> 14:53.914
<i>You. On the ledge.</i>

14:54.081 --> 14:55.946
<i>This is the police.</i>

14:56.117 --> 14:57.675
<i>Move away from the window.</i>

14:57.852 --> 14:59.479
<i>Move to your right.</i>

14:59.653 --> 15:02.087
<i>A firefighter is there to assist you.</i>

15:02.256 --> 15:04.588
<i>Move to your right. Slowly.</i>

15:05.860 --> 15:08.351
<i>- Slowly.
- Is he all right?</i>

15:08.529 --> 15:10.360
Yeah, they got him. He's fine.

15:10.531 --> 15:14.433
<i>Hello, Ms. Black. Hello, Your Honor.</i>

15:16.237 --> 15:18.330
<i>Have a nice night.</i>

15:23.544 --> 15:25.876
- You look a little crazed.
- Aren't you?

15:26.046 --> 15:28.276
- About what?
- People on the ledges.

15:28.449 --> 15:32.045
- Helicopters buzzing you.
- The price of fame, Harry.

15:32.220 --> 15:33.448
Is it worth it?

15:33.622 --> 15:36.921
Dan was wrong.
I netted $8 million last year.

15:37.092 --> 15:39.652
- You netted $8 million?
- Craven?!

15:39.828 --> 15:41.921
I lost my contact lens
when I was here before.

15:42.097 --> 15:44.361
Craven, you get your skulking carcass
out of here.

15:44.533 --> 15:45.966
Isn't an introduction in order?

15:46.134 --> 15:49.968
- Bull.
- Oh, please. Not... No Bull. No, please.

15:50.238 --> 15:51.830
Yeah?

16:05.687 --> 16:08.155
- Male.
- Female.

16:21.237 --> 16:23.398
- Male.
- Female.

16:35.451 --> 16:38.716
So where are you planning
to take me to dinner?

16:39.255 --> 16:40.813
Jennifer, we have to talk.

16:41.624 --> 16:44.991
- You asked me, you're paying.
- Yeah, I know. Come here.

16:45.161 --> 16:48.028
We've got to have a serious talk.

16:48.698 --> 16:50.757
Okay, but I warn you.

16:50.933 --> 16:53.959
Daddy won't give us his blessing
after only one date.

16:54.136 --> 16:57.833
Jennifer. I'm afraid it's gonna be
impossible to...

17:02.278 --> 17:06.544
Docket update. Check it over,
and then I'll post it.

17:06.949 --> 17:10.442
- Miss Tuttle, I'm busy.
- Aren't we all.

17:11.121 --> 17:15.022
I'll look at this when I have a chance,
and if I have any comments, you'll know.

17:15.425 --> 17:16.949
Fine.

17:18.395 --> 17:21.830
I caught you at the Garden. Nice show.

17:23.867 --> 17:27.826
Come on. We're not gonna get
any peace around here.

17:39.349 --> 17:42.443
The coast is clear.
Jennifer, you okay in there?

17:42.619 --> 17:46.282
Fine, thanks. I've done this before.

17:46.456 --> 17:48.356
We'll meet you there, Your Honor.

18:02.106 --> 18:05.371
- Hey, mama.
- Hey, kiss off.

18:11.049 --> 18:13.415
- Hi.
- Hi.

18:15.753 --> 18:20.122
I can fit all my toiletries in one handbag.

18:23.628 --> 18:25.528
Sign here.

18:32.637 --> 18:35.936
- Female.
- I agree. No bet.

18:38.843 --> 18:43.212
You know, it was all so simple
in the '40s.

18:50.789 --> 18:52.450
All clear.

18:57.096 --> 18:58.927
Very nice.

18:59.098 --> 19:03.728
Well, I never thought I was gonna
say this to anyone, but...

19:04.670 --> 19:06.069
...would you care to join me?

19:06.238 --> 19:08.206
I'd be delighted.

19:08.374 --> 19:09.602
Have fun, you two.

19:09.775 --> 19:12.437
I knew you were gonna say that.

19:17.783 --> 19:19.250
So.

19:19.418 --> 19:23.787
What's a nice girl like you
doing in a place like this?

19:24.490 --> 19:28.051
All right, autographs with pens, $ 10.

19:28.827 --> 19:31.955
Personalized stationery, used tissue,
that sort of thing...

19:32.131 --> 19:34.361
...strictly supply and demand.

19:36.835 --> 19:38.996
Do I have an opening bid?

19:40.807 --> 19:42.035
So...

19:42.208 --> 19:45.268
...we didn't sneak off to the men's room
to hold hands, did we?

19:46.212 --> 19:47.907
Jennifer.

19:48.248 --> 19:51.684
- I like you a lot.
- I like you a lot.

19:51.851 --> 19:53.648
But it's not that simple.

19:56.189 --> 19:58.316
You're married, and you didn't tell me.

19:58.491 --> 20:00.516
Something like that.

20:01.327 --> 20:04.490
- I'm not married to another woman.
- Well, you don't mean...

20:04.664 --> 20:07.656
No, no. What I mean is...

20:07.834 --> 20:10.098
...I am married to an idea.

20:10.270 --> 20:14.070
The idea of becoming the best judge
that I can be.

20:14.240 --> 20:17.767
But with all your fans, and the hoopla,
the press, the attention...

20:17.944 --> 20:19.377
You're dumping me, aren't you?

20:20.647 --> 20:23.707
- You're not mine to dump.
- I could be.

20:25.785 --> 20:27.377
Jennifer.

20:28.154 --> 20:33.286
You are the sweetest person
I have met in a long, long time.

20:33.461 --> 20:36.589
You can call it intuition,
you can call it a gut feeling...

20:36.764 --> 20:40.666
...but I knew that from the first moment
I laid eyes on you.

20:40.835 --> 20:43.065
And what makes it even
more magical is that...

20:43.237 --> 20:45.364
...it was just a chance meeting.

20:45.539 --> 20:49.635
Because if I had set out
to look for someone...

20:49.810 --> 20:53.473
...it would have been someone
just like you.

20:55.716 --> 20:59.083
We want to be alone.

21:04.925 --> 21:09.624
- Well, I guess that's that, huh?
- Jennifer, I'd like to see you again.

21:09.797 --> 21:12.095
- But...
- But it's hard right now.

21:12.266 --> 21:15.724
I can't serve justice with all this
happening around me, it's not possible.

21:15.903 --> 21:19.430
I know. Same thing happened
with a man I met in Los Angeles.

21:19.607 --> 21:20.939
He owned a crystal shop.

21:22.310 --> 21:25.074
Twelve thousand in damages the first week.

21:25.914 --> 21:28.007
- Jennifer.
- Being on the road so much...

21:28.183 --> 21:31.744
...it's hard to know anyone
long enough...

21:31.920 --> 21:35.686
...to find out if there's even a possibility
for a long-term relationship.

21:36.258 --> 21:39.318
Sounds to me like you want
a long-term relationship.

21:39.928 --> 21:42.021
So sue me. I'm a romantic.

21:42.697 --> 21:44.790
Then you have some choices to make,
don't you?

21:46.268 --> 21:49.169
Yeah. I guess I do.

21:51.106 --> 21:53.700
- You know that feeling I told you about?
- The gut one?

21:53.875 --> 21:55.638
Yeah. I got another one.

21:55.811 --> 21:58.006
I know that somewhere, sometime...

21:58.180 --> 22:00.410
...we are gonna see each other again.

22:01.416 --> 22:03.145
I feel it too.

22:03.318 --> 22:05.013
- But.
- But?

22:05.187 --> 22:11.593
Next time, we meet in the ladies' lounge.
It's a better class of graffiti.

22:17.533 --> 22:20.434
Sign where I've indicated.
