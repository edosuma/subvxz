WEBVTT

00:01.002 --> 00:04.036
(piano music)

00:20.421 --> 00:23.522
(uplifting music)

00:23.524 --> 00:25.557
- [Emilia] I have to
tell you something.

00:25.559 --> 00:27.126
It's actually from my diary

00:27.128 --> 00:29.795
called Emilia's Super
Fantastic Diary.

00:29.797 --> 00:34.333
And you really shouldn't tell
your diary stuff to anyone,

00:34.335 --> 00:36.769
but since I'm Emilia, I
guess I can tell you this.

00:37.705 --> 00:39.138
It all happened near my home,

00:39.140 --> 00:41.740
the cove, and the
butter factory,

00:41.742 --> 00:45.277
and the school
and Simon's house.

00:45.279 --> 00:48.614
It was really strange and scary.

00:48.616 --> 00:53.218
As a story at midnight, it
was totally dark and glum.

00:53.220 --> 00:55.354
My mom always says
I shouldn't be too,

00:55.356 --> 00:57.389
what's that word?

00:57.391 --> 00:58.257
Negative.

00:59.460 --> 01:02.728
But sometimes, I just
have to be a bit negative.

01:02.730 --> 01:06.198
(dramatic fast-paced music)

01:06.200 --> 01:07.800
It all started when our
biology teacher went fishing

01:07.802 --> 01:08.867
at midnight.

01:10.304 --> 01:12.504
During the day, he's
at school with us.

01:12.506 --> 01:14.606
So he has to fish at night.

01:14.608 --> 01:17.509
(uplifting music)

01:38.499 --> 01:41.500
(ship horn blares)

01:48.742 --> 01:51.777
(suspenseful music)

01:52.680 --> 01:55.114
- Hullaballoo.
- Hullaballoo.

01:59.320 --> 02:01.153
- Let's go get him.
- Let's go get him.

02:01.155 --> 02:03.322
C'mon, c'mon, hush, hush.

02:04.458 --> 02:06.158
- Hey, what, what,
what is happening?

02:06.160 --> 02:07.392
What, hey, hey.

02:07.394 --> 02:10.796
What, hey, hey, hey,
hey, help, help, help.

02:12.533 --> 02:13.599
What?

02:15.469 --> 02:16.301
Help.

02:16.303 --> 02:19.638
(fish speak gibberish)

02:24.445 --> 02:25.177
(splash)

02:25.179 --> 02:27.880
(suspenseful music)

02:34.655 --> 02:37.556
(teacher pants)

02:40.628 --> 02:42.961
(fish laugh)

02:42.963 --> 02:45.264
(guinea-pig squeaks)

02:45.266 --> 02:48.333
(music intensifies)

03:51.365 --> 03:54.533
- Well hello, did
you run away again?

03:56.537 --> 03:58.303
- [Emilia] Actually,
it all started

03:58.305 --> 04:00.405
when this pet store
opened near us.

04:00.407 --> 04:02.241
They used to sell house plants.

04:02.243 --> 04:04.610
I'm not interested
in house plants.

04:04.612 --> 04:09.414
Or maybe I would be, if I
was a plant, like a cactus.

04:09.416 --> 04:11.817
But animals are a
different story.

04:11.819 --> 04:13.685
I always stopped by the window

04:13.687 --> 04:15.654
and I passed by it very often

04:15.656 --> 04:16.755
as it's on my way to--

04:16.757 --> 04:18.023
(school bell rings)

04:18.025 --> 04:20.025
oh no, school!

04:20.027 --> 04:20.926
Not again!

04:35.509 --> 04:36.575
Thanks.

04:38.779 --> 04:41.580
(church bell rings)
(children cheer)

04:41.582 --> 04:42.681
See you guys.

04:42.683 --> 04:45.617
(owl hoots)

04:45.619 --> 04:47.286
Oh, hey little guy.

04:50.924 --> 04:52.891
(church bell rings)
(owl hoots)

04:52.893 --> 04:57.596
(train dings)
(police siren wails)

04:57.598 --> 04:59.498
- Hey, hey, you two boys!

04:59.500 --> 05:01.366
Stop there, stop
what you're doing!

05:01.368 --> 05:04.936
- It's your principal
speaking, the prince, yeehaw!

05:04.938 --> 05:07.739
And a few pieces of information.

05:07.741 --> 05:09.875
When washing your
hands, remember,

05:09.877 --> 05:12.311
one piece of paper per hand.

05:12.313 --> 05:14.579
I mean, two pieces
of paper per hand.

05:14.581 --> 05:16.715
No, one piece of paper per
pair of hands (laughs).

05:16.717 --> 05:18.383
Yeehaw!

05:18.385 --> 05:21.353
Oh and health alert, be
aware, pin worms, diarrhea

05:21.355 --> 05:22.688
and parasites,

05:22.690 --> 05:24.623
so wash your hands and no
rubbing heads together.

05:24.625 --> 05:25.824
We have lice.

05:25.826 --> 05:27.059
Yahoo, yeehaw!

05:29.897 --> 05:30.896
(door dings)

05:30.898 --> 05:32.664
- Morning Simon.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.733
- You're not the
only one that's late.

05:34.735 --> 05:37.803
(dramatic rock music)

05:47.715 --> 05:50.916
- Hey there, you guys remembered
to wipe your filthy feet

05:50.918 --> 05:52.484
outside, right?

05:52.486 --> 05:53.485
- Yeah.

05:53.487 --> 05:54.386
- Good.

05:57.691 --> 05:59.691
Seaweed for Simon.

05:59.693 --> 06:01.560
Like your breakfast?

06:02.363 --> 06:04.029
- Open up wide, baby.

06:06.700 --> 06:09.434
- This isn't
seaweed, it's clover.

06:09.436 --> 06:12.738
- Today we'll discuss the
old enemies of our waters.

06:12.740 --> 06:13.839
Any guesses?

06:13.841 --> 06:16.408
What could that be?

06:16.410 --> 06:18.176
What bacteria could it be?

06:18.178 --> 06:22.114
Not the yellow bacteria,
not the magenta.

06:22.116 --> 06:24.149
Come on kids, you
need to participate.

06:24.151 --> 06:25.317
Success in life

06:25.318 --> 06:26.484
- [Emilia] Simon
is my best friend.

06:26.487 --> 06:28.587
A lot of kids think he's strange

06:28.589 --> 06:30.188
but his dad is the strange one.

06:30.190 --> 06:32.491
He has a seaweed
stand on the beach.

06:32.493 --> 06:37.062
Simon often has seaweed as a
snack because it's healthy.

06:39.099 --> 06:41.533
Greasy Antero bullies him.

06:41.535 --> 06:44.836
Every morning, Greasy Antero
styles his hair with butter.

06:44.838 --> 06:48.173
They have a lot of it, as his
dad owns the butter factory.

06:48.175 --> 06:50.142
And everyday, he bullies Simon.

06:50.144 --> 06:51.443
- Who knows the answer?

06:51.445 --> 06:53.078
The clock is ticking.

06:55.749 --> 06:59.618
And the correct answer
is Cyanobacteria, yes,

06:59.620 --> 07:01.653
and where do we have it?

07:01.655 --> 07:03.989
(suspenseful music)

07:03.991 --> 07:07.759
Yes, in the Baltic Sea
and what does it cause?

07:07.761 --> 07:09.661
Good, eutrophication

07:11.031 --> 07:12.998
and what does it kill?

07:13.000 --> 07:14.966
The organisms.
(kids laugh)

07:14.968 --> 07:16.968
Boy, I'm on a roll today.

07:16.970 --> 07:18.603
- What are you doing Simon?

07:18.605 --> 07:20.605
- [Teacher] And what
causes the pollution then?

07:20.607 --> 07:21.606
- You're idiots.

07:21.608 --> 07:22.741
- Idiots, that's correct.

07:22.743 --> 07:24.209
Idiots pollute the ocean.

07:24.211 --> 07:26.044
Well done Simon, our weed
and algae specialist.

07:26.046 --> 07:29.114
But pick up the
pencils you dropped.

07:31.718 --> 07:36.121
Yes, let's keep this classroom
and the nature clean.

07:38.792 --> 07:41.560
- Dad and I were thinking
of buying a telescope.

07:41.562 --> 07:43.895
But not a big one,
it's not practical.

07:43.897 --> 07:45.564
It would be too
heavy when traveling.

07:45.566 --> 07:46.565
- What're you looking at?

07:46.567 --> 07:47.232
- Isn't it cute?

07:47.234 --> 07:50.502
(girls laugh)

07:50.504 --> 07:52.904
(sad music)

07:55.175 --> 07:58.176
(girls laugh)

07:58.178 --> 07:59.177
- Bye.

07:59.179 --> 08:00.011
- Bye.

08:05.786 --> 08:07.652
- Look at what Kiersha
shared with everyone.

08:07.654 --> 08:09.154
Greasy got a pool
for his birthday.

08:09.156 --> 08:10.956
Cool, right?

08:10.958 --> 08:12.090
- Pool slides are great.

08:12.092 --> 08:14.893
- Yeah, I always go on them.

08:14.895 --> 08:16.962
- My dad can't even handle
a small slide though.

08:16.964 --> 08:18.230
(Emilia laughs)

08:18.232 --> 08:19.931
- What's that noise?

08:19.933 --> 08:21.833
- I don't know, it
only used to stink,

08:21.835 --> 08:24.002
now there's that noise.

08:28.942 --> 08:32.911
- Hi there, I made this basic
weed and moss based porridge.

08:32.913 --> 08:34.679
There you go.

08:34.681 --> 08:36.147
If you want to
make it more meaty,

08:36.149 --> 08:38.316
sprinkle some animal
plankton on top.

08:38.318 --> 08:40.285
Oh, Emilia, are you hungry?

08:40.287 --> 08:42.654
We've got dessert as well.

08:42.656 --> 08:44.623
You can make a nice
jam from a jellyfish.

08:44.625 --> 08:47.859
Take a look (laughs).

08:48.829 --> 08:51.763
Oh, don't worry.

08:51.764 --> 08:54.698
It's not from this cove, have
to clean it seaweed elsewhere.

08:54.701 --> 08:57.602
Don't know how long I
can keep this stand open,

08:57.604 --> 08:59.971
the trees are grain.

08:59.973 --> 09:01.339
Here you go.

09:01.341 --> 09:02.974
- Sorry, but I'm
not really hungry

09:02.976 --> 09:04.142
and my moms waiting for me.

09:04.144 --> 09:05.143
- [Emilia's Mom] Emilia!

09:05.145 --> 09:06.545
- Hey mom!

09:06.547 --> 09:08.980
- Emilia, I've got
a surprise for you!

09:08.982 --> 09:10.682
Simon, come along with us.

09:10.684 --> 09:13.084
(train rings)

09:15.222 --> 09:17.289
- What kind of fur
ball do you want?

09:17.291 --> 09:18.290
- Seriously mom?

09:18.292 --> 09:19.958
I get one finally?

09:19.960 --> 09:21.126
- Yes sweetie.

09:21.128 --> 09:22.994
You finally get one.
- Yes!

09:22.996 --> 09:25.864
- Hey, hey, be careful, okay.

09:25.866 --> 09:27.866
Some animals have
been on the run.

09:27.868 --> 09:29.034
They can get a little
tricky sometimes.

09:29.036 --> 09:32.203
A rare beetle is still missing.

09:32.205 --> 09:34.339
- [Emilia's Mom]
Choose carefully.

09:34.341 --> 09:36.308
- I know mom, I know.

09:36.310 --> 09:38.977
(pig oinks)

09:38.979 --> 09:40.278
- A guinea pig?

09:40.280 --> 09:41.913
Kind of boring.

09:41.915 --> 09:44.149
- But I've always
wanted a guinea pig.

09:44.151 --> 09:46.284
- Let's look at the
other critters as well.

09:46.286 --> 09:47.686
- Like a fish.

09:50.824 --> 09:53.325
(snake hisses)

09:56.363 --> 09:57.262
- Aw, aw.

09:59.900 --> 10:01.967
You're so cute.

10:01.969 --> 10:04.102
(laughs)

10:09.009 --> 10:11.676
Ow, hey, why did you do that?

10:13.981 --> 10:15.814
- Hey mom, this guinea pi--
- Don't tell her.

10:15.816 --> 10:18.149
If you tell her it bit you,
she won't buy it for you.

10:18.151 --> 10:19.718
You won't get it.

10:19.720 --> 10:21.686
- Emilia, what about
the guinea pig?

10:21.688 --> 10:24.222
- This guinea pig is so cute.

10:24.224 --> 10:27.892
- I'll give you a discount
since this is a strange one.

10:27.894 --> 10:29.995
Keeps it's own company,
doesn't like baths,

10:29.997 --> 10:32.297
walks it's own path.

10:32.299 --> 10:33.331
- Perfect, yes, we'll take it.

10:33.333 --> 10:35.300
- Come to the register.

10:36.903 --> 10:38.703
- [Emilia's Mom] What does
a fur ball like that need?

10:38.705 --> 10:41.206
- Food, cage, some
love and affection.

10:41.208 --> 10:43.441
You have some kind of
preferred customer card

10:43.443 --> 10:45.043
or rewards points?

10:45.045 --> 10:46.978
Gold, silver, copperton?

10:46.980 --> 10:49.047
- Just the debit card.

10:49.049 --> 10:50.348
I hope you find your beetle.

10:50.350 --> 10:51.883
- [Store Clerk] We always
find them somewhere.

10:51.885 --> 10:53.084
They're always crawling
around somewhere, I just--

10:53.086 --> 10:54.953
(crunch)

10:58.058 --> 10:59.658
It's just crisp bread
for the bunnies.

10:59.660 --> 11:02.694
You're gonna need
a water bottle too.

11:07.167 --> 11:09.401
- Guinea pigs can't
run in wheels.

11:09.403 --> 11:12.037
- But this little
guy can do anything.

11:12.039 --> 11:14.673
What about fluffy?

11:14.675 --> 11:16.741
Butterball?

11:16.743 --> 11:17.976
Pumpkin?

11:17.978 --> 11:19.144
- How about Pavarotti?

11:19.146 --> 11:20.378
Is it a boy or a girl?

11:20.380 --> 11:22.013
- Mom?
- Hm?

11:22.015 --> 11:26.017
- Is this a boy or a girl?
- Oh, I forgot to ask.

11:28.188 --> 11:31.356
(guinea pig squeaks)

11:33.026 --> 11:34.325
Don't know.

11:34.327 --> 11:36.127
- It has to be a
really cute name.

11:36.129 --> 11:37.195
- Anita Hirvonen?

11:37.197 --> 11:39.064
- There's no telling
with these things.

11:39.066 --> 11:39.964
- Duster?

11:41.234 --> 11:42.200
- Hey look.

11:47.708 --> 11:51.443
I think it's a sign, maybe
it wants to be Halonen.

11:51.445 --> 11:52.944
- Or, Tarja, the pig.

11:52.946 --> 11:54.946
- Guinea pig Halonen.

11:54.948 --> 11:56.781
It's guinea pig Halonen.

11:56.783 --> 11:58.049
- [Simon] Well I
gotta go home now.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.384
- Bye Simon.

11:59.386 --> 12:02.821
- [Emilia] I got the world's
cutest guinea pig today.

12:02.823 --> 12:05.056
Her eyes look like
two giant balls.

12:05.058 --> 12:06.925
She has lovely little bug teeth.

12:06.927 --> 12:09.227
(knocks)

12:09.229 --> 12:10.795
- Snacks are ready
in the kitchen.

12:10.797 --> 12:12.464
- I'll be right down.

12:16.903 --> 12:20.205
She's like one fluffy
ball, all rolled in and--

12:20.207 --> 12:21.172
- Come on, kiddo.

12:21.174 --> 12:22.907
The sandwiches are getting cold.

12:22.909 --> 12:24.375
- Okay, I'm coming.

12:26.179 --> 12:28.179
Mom's boyfriend Pertti
gets on my nerves.

12:28.181 --> 12:30.081
Why are sandwiches so important?

12:30.083 --> 12:32.317
Why does he eat all the time?

12:32.319 --> 12:34.219
- All right Em, mom's waiting.

12:34.221 --> 12:35.386
Let's get moving.

12:35.388 --> 12:37.489
- Dad, what're you doing here?

12:37.491 --> 12:39.057
- Came to eat, okay?

12:39.059 --> 12:40.458
And say hi to you.

12:42.129 --> 12:44.429
- Not a moments peace here.

12:52.539 --> 12:58.009
But it's nice that dad comes
over to see us for dinner.

12:58.011 --> 12:59.811
Mom and dad got divorced
when I was eight.

12:59.813 --> 13:03.148
They're friends, even
though dad has a new home.

13:03.150 --> 13:05.450
It's peaceful at dads but boring

13:05.452 --> 13:08.353
because he's been writing
his book for five years now.

13:08.355 --> 13:11.489
He just writes and
writes and writes.

13:12.592 --> 13:15.927
I like living her
with mom and Pertti.

13:18.165 --> 13:22.500
No peace here but it's
cleaner and it smells nicer.

13:22.502 --> 13:25.103
- I see Pertti has his
brewery going again.

13:25.105 --> 13:27.438
- At the resort next week,
you'll get the best beer

13:27.440 --> 13:30.041
this side of the Baltic.

13:30.043 --> 13:31.442
- [Emilia's Dad] How was
your summer vacation?

13:31.444 --> 13:33.144
- Vacation?

13:33.146 --> 13:35.613
That's funny, I wish I could
go away for even a weekend.

13:35.615 --> 13:37.849
A few days at the spa.

13:37.851 --> 13:39.083
What happened to your finger?

13:39.085 --> 13:41.052
- Uh, no.

13:41.053 --> 13:43.020
The guinea pig, her
cage, I got scratched.

13:43.023 --> 13:45.890
- Oh no, they might have
to chop off your finger.

13:45.892 --> 13:48.092
- Well it needs
to be disinfected.

13:48.094 --> 13:50.228
- Well, I better get going.

13:52.232 --> 13:54.098
Bye sweetie.

13:54.100 --> 13:55.600
- Bye dad.

13:55.602 --> 13:58.403
Mom is a nurse and she
knows about these things.

13:58.405 --> 14:00.071
- [Emilia's Dad] Ah,
this Uber's expensive.

14:00.073 --> 14:02.907
- [Emilia] She always
has a first aid kit.

14:02.909 --> 14:06.244
You never know if a
guinea pig will bite.

14:07.647 --> 14:11.182
But mom's boyfriend Pertti,
he's not exactly a genius.

14:11.184 --> 14:12.517
He eats all the time.

14:12.519 --> 14:16.588
He's from Turku and thinks
that you don't get fat.

14:23.864 --> 14:26.197
Well, her business, not mine.

14:31.137 --> 14:33.104
- Goodnight little one.

14:43.016 --> 14:45.917
(thunder rumbles)

14:50.090 --> 14:53.024
(suspenseful music)

14:53.026 --> 14:56.160
(car engine rumbles)

15:18.151 --> 15:21.052
(car horn blares)

15:27.360 --> 15:30.995
- [Guinea Pig] Hello,
wakey wakey, anybody home?

15:30.997 --> 15:32.664
- Who's there?

15:32.666 --> 15:34.666
- [Guinea Pig] It's me.

15:37.137 --> 15:38.036
- What?

15:39.706 --> 15:43.341
- Can I get a double
cheeseburger with
an order of fries

15:43.343 --> 15:45.109
and a milkshake?

15:45.111 --> 15:46.711
Nah, it was a joke.

15:46.713 --> 15:48.479
Guinea pig humor, you know?

15:48.481 --> 15:49.380
Hop in.

15:50.350 --> 15:51.683
C'mon get in.

15:51.685 --> 15:54.252
- I don't think so, go away.

16:01.561 --> 16:04.228
I know you're not
real, I'm dreaming.

16:04.230 --> 16:05.630
- Yep, it's a dream.

16:05.632 --> 16:07.265
Come on now and
put on a sweater.

16:07.267 --> 16:09.233
It's chilly out here.

16:15.775 --> 16:18.176
- Well it's just a dream.

16:18.178 --> 16:21.245
(suspenseful music)

16:31.191 --> 16:32.490
- [Dispatch] There's
a situation in Norway,

16:32.492 --> 16:34.392
a (mumbles) stuck in a
drain, code seven six one.

16:34.394 --> 16:38.463
- Sorry dispatch, I'm in the
middle of a two four five.

16:38.465 --> 16:40.531
- [Dispatch] Roger that.

16:43.136 --> 16:45.169
We got a cow stuck
in a house in Mexico.

16:45.171 --> 16:46.571
He can't get out the
doors or the windows.

16:46.573 --> 16:49.140
(car beeps)

16:54.714 --> 16:57.348
(rocket blast off)

16:57.350 --> 16:58.383
- [Emilia] Hey, take it easy.

16:58.385 --> 17:00.385
I'm gonna wake up.

17:00.387 --> 17:01.652
- Aren't we a nervous one?

17:01.654 --> 17:05.590
Two seven four, ETA Mexico,
two hours 30 minutes.

17:05.592 --> 17:08.359
Actually more like,
say, two and 40,

17:08.361 --> 17:09.427
I gotta go grab grub first.

17:09.429 --> 17:10.561
Over and out.

17:10.563 --> 17:11.829
- Hey you, where are we going?

17:11.831 --> 17:13.064
- What did you say?

17:13.066 --> 17:14.265
- Where are we going?

17:14.267 --> 17:15.366
- Going to Lotti.

17:15.368 --> 17:16.434
- Why Lotti?

17:17.470 --> 17:18.736
- Tell me about it,

17:18.738 --> 17:22.306
I wanted to go to the
ski resort in Germany.

17:22.308 --> 17:23.541
- [Dispatch] Two seven four,

17:23.543 --> 17:24.742
how the weather
looking up there?

17:24.744 --> 17:26.511
- We got some snow coming down.

17:26.513 --> 17:29.347
Hey backseat, turbulence ahead.

17:29.349 --> 17:32.250
(car beeps)

17:32.252 --> 17:35.486
(inspirational music)

17:49.102 --> 17:50.501
- [Dispatch] We got
another case of a puffin

17:50.503 --> 17:51.602
stuck in Iceland.

17:51.604 --> 17:53.071
- Two seven four, free tomorrow.

17:53.073 --> 17:54.372
Over and out.

17:54.374 --> 17:55.807
- [Dispatch]
Alrighty, roger that.

17:55.809 --> 17:56.874
- Over and out.

17:56.876 --> 17:58.176
- [Dispatch] You
already said that.

17:58.178 --> 17:58.609
- Oh, sorry.

17:58.611 --> 18:00.094
Over and out.

18:00.095 --> 18:01.578
- [Dispatch] You don't have
to, you already said it.

18:01.581 --> 18:02.246
- Okay, nevermind.

18:02.248 --> 18:03.247
Over and out.

18:03.249 --> 18:04.315
- Why are we here?

18:04.317 --> 18:08.219
- (laughs) You'll soon see.

18:10.523 --> 18:13.424
Okay little missy,
this is your exit.

18:13.426 --> 18:16.427
(Emilia screams)

18:32.212 --> 18:34.846
(Emilia screams)

18:42.789 --> 18:46.524
(giant guinea pig grunts)

19:01.174 --> 19:01.906
- Help me.

19:03.409 --> 19:05.943
- (laughs) Hello Emilia,
it was quite a ride.

19:05.945 --> 19:07.445
You did well on that slope.

19:07.447 --> 19:09.747
Could've stuck the
landing a bit better.

19:09.749 --> 19:11.282
- What?

19:11.284 --> 19:13.317
(camera clicks)

19:13.319 --> 19:14.352
- Ah, wait.

19:14.354 --> 19:15.653
I'll upload this to the net.

19:15.655 --> 19:19.290
Longest selfie stick in
all of Finland (laughs).

19:19.292 --> 19:20.591
- Who are you?

19:20.593 --> 19:21.759
What are you?

19:23.296 --> 19:25.329
- I'm the guinea pig, the
giant guinea pig, you know.

19:25.331 --> 19:27.899
Open your mouth, come on.

19:27.901 --> 19:29.734
Ah (laughs).

19:29.736 --> 19:31.402
How does that feel?

19:31.404 --> 19:32.904
- How does what feel?

19:32.906 --> 19:35.473
- I'm guessing a guinea pig
bit your finger today, right?

19:35.475 --> 19:37.208
- Yeah.

19:37.210 --> 19:39.443
- It was a sign, you know.

19:40.647 --> 19:42.246
- What is this?

19:42.248 --> 19:44.482
- You've been chosen to be
super fur ball, quite an honor,

19:44.484 --> 19:45.716
you know?

19:45.718 --> 19:47.418
- Who exactly chose me?

19:47.420 --> 19:50.988
- Aw, the guinea pigs, not
me, but the little ones.

19:50.990 --> 19:54.825
I just handle the PR and
supervise the actions

19:54.827 --> 19:56.827
of the super fur balls.

19:59.465 --> 20:00.531
Every time you take a sip

20:00.533 --> 20:03.467
from the guinea pig
Halonen's bottle,

20:03.469 --> 20:05.770
you turn into super fur ball.

20:05.772 --> 20:06.704
- So cool!

20:06.706 --> 20:08.439
(giant guinea pig laughs)

20:08.441 --> 20:09.440
- Yeah, super powers.

20:09.442 --> 20:11.475
Hey, can I kick Greasy's butt?

20:11.477 --> 20:14.011
- No, you can't
abuse your powers.

20:14.013 --> 20:16.948
You cannot abuse your powers.

20:16.950 --> 20:20.017
Your mission is more
important than you think.

20:20.019 --> 20:22.520
A school of herrings
are riding in the cove,

20:22.522 --> 20:23.988
breaking everything.

20:23.990 --> 20:26.557
You have to calm
down the herrings.

20:26.559 --> 20:28.693
(Emilia coughs)

20:28.695 --> 20:30.962
Hm, cool, you're beginning
to get into your guinea pig

20:30.964 --> 20:32.029
groove now.

20:32.031 --> 20:33.864
- Ah, horrible teeth.

20:33.866 --> 20:36.567
(camera clicks)

20:38.037 --> 20:40.571
(alarm rings)

21:00.293 --> 21:04.762
Hey, Mr. Halonen, I had the
strangest dream last night.

21:14.307 --> 21:17.441
(guinea pig squeaks)

21:28.988 --> 21:31.422
- I see you have baseball today.

21:31.424 --> 21:32.556
That's fun, right?

21:32.558 --> 21:33.557
- It sucks.

21:33.558 --> 21:34.557
- Take your water
bottle with you.

21:34.560 --> 21:35.593
It's, how do you kids say?

21:35.595 --> 21:36.427
Tots hots.

21:37.997 --> 21:39.563
- Nobody says that mom.

21:39.565 --> 21:41.299
- Uh, seriously.

21:41.301 --> 21:42.333
I look fine.

21:43.569 --> 21:44.602
I look fine.

21:45.838 --> 21:47.538
Don't forget the water bottle.

21:47.540 --> 21:51.475
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:53.780 --> 21:55.313
- Bye!

21:55.315 --> 21:56.013
- Bye bye.

22:02.422 --> 22:05.489
(herrings chanting)

22:30.650 --> 22:31.549
Tots bad.

22:34.120 --> 22:36.854
(playful music)

22:43.496 --> 22:44.762
Where is it?

22:44.764 --> 22:45.663
Ugh.

22:47.166 --> 22:48.566
Ugh.

22:48.568 --> 22:49.867
Where is my shoe?

23:22.068 --> 23:23.634
- Today we're gonna
be playing baseball

23:23.636 --> 23:25.669
or as I like to
call it, crazy ball.

23:25.671 --> 23:27.071
We're gonna stick to the basics

23:27.073 --> 23:28.739
and have some fun.

23:28.741 --> 23:30.207
(dog barking)

23:30.209 --> 23:31.675
- [Emilia] I hate baseball.

23:31.677 --> 23:34.812
It's the most boring sport ever.

23:34.814 --> 23:36.814
The PE teacher is so
crazy about sports.

23:36.816 --> 23:38.883
She eats a ton of
cottage cheese.

23:38.885 --> 23:41.452
- Today the teams will
be selected by Antoro.

23:41.454 --> 23:44.622
- [Emilia] It's dangerous to
eat that much cottage cheese.

23:44.624 --> 23:45.890
- [PE Teacher] And Emilia.

23:45.892 --> 23:47.224
- Well gee wiz.

23:49.529 --> 23:50.428
Let's go.

23:51.798 --> 23:54.899
Okay, the best ones here
with me, lose with Emilia.

23:54.901 --> 23:56.066
Done.

23:56.068 --> 23:57.635
- One at a time Anturo.

23:57.637 --> 23:59.537
Emilia, go ahead.

23:59.539 --> 24:00.971
- Kisika.

24:00.973 --> 24:03.607
- I'll take Peter, or
better known as Farty.

24:03.609 --> 24:04.842
(kids laugh)

24:04.844 --> 24:08.245
- [Emilia] I like to
have Simon on my team

24:08.247 --> 24:10.481
but he always strikes out.

24:10.483 --> 24:13.017
Why do I have to
choose the teams?

24:13.019 --> 24:14.585
I don't want to.

24:15.822 --> 24:20.825
If I choose him, we'll lose
and everyone will blame me.

24:21.093 --> 24:21.859
- Leslie.

24:23.196 --> 24:25.162
Of course she'll take
Simon, they're dating.

24:25.164 --> 24:26.797
- [Farty] Aw, cute couple.

24:26.799 --> 24:28.032
- No we're not.

24:28.034 --> 24:30.935
- Simon, Emilia's
team wants you.

24:35.208 --> 24:37.007
- I'll take the dog.

24:37.009 --> 24:38.742
- Hey, hey, I don't want Simon.

24:38.744 --> 24:40.878
Let's pick new teams.

24:40.880 --> 24:42.813
- [Kid] Yeah, we
don't want Simon.

24:42.815 --> 24:45.182
All he does is strike out.

24:45.184 --> 24:46.951
- [Emilia] This is
really horrible.

24:46.953 --> 24:49.520
(sad music)

24:53.192 --> 24:54.108
(whistle blows)

24:54.109 --> 24:55.025
- [PE Teacher] Strike three.

24:55.027 --> 24:55.860
(whistle blows)

24:55.862 --> 24:56.694
- Thanks four eyes.

24:56.696 --> 24:57.528
You missed 15.

24:57.530 --> 24:58.696
Such a lame loser.

24:58.698 --> 24:59.930
- Yo loser.

24:59.932 --> 25:02.266
- [Emilia] Oh boy, this
is never gonna end.

25:02.268 --> 25:03.767
(whistle blows)

25:03.769 --> 25:05.669
- This is it, kids,
the last inning.

25:05.670 --> 25:07.570
- Simon, go to the out field
and stay out of the way, 'kay?

25:07.573 --> 25:10.007
- Go as far as you can.

25:10.009 --> 25:12.910
(whistle blows)

25:13.846 --> 25:15.980
- [Greasy] Simon, catch it.

25:18.117 --> 25:19.617
- Next batter.

25:19.619 --> 25:20.718
(whistle blows)

25:20.720 --> 25:21.952
Mikey, step up.

25:21.954 --> 25:23.854
Emilia, you're next.

25:28.628 --> 25:30.728
(whistle blows)

25:30.730 --> 25:31.896
Second out.

25:31.898 --> 25:32.930
- [Emilia] Only the second?

25:32.932 --> 25:33.898
Help.

25:33.900 --> 25:35.065
Do I have to?

25:41.674 --> 25:42.940
- All right, let's
get a move on.

25:42.942 --> 25:44.675
I'm not missing lunch today.

25:44.677 --> 25:47.011
- If you miss, you'll lose.

25:47.947 --> 25:50.314
Sorry, when you
miss, you'll lose.

25:50.316 --> 25:51.916
- Hey, I need to
ask you something.

25:51.918 --> 25:55.953
(phone chimes)
(PE teacher claps)

25:55.955 --> 25:58.589
- (laughs) What
happened to your face?

25:58.591 --> 26:01.692
- [PE Teacher] Quit
talking and play some ball.

26:01.694 --> 26:04.261
(playful music)

26:07.800 --> 26:09.934
- Oh boy, this is
really exciting.

26:09.936 --> 26:11.635
- The last and final strike

26:11.637 --> 26:13.804
and then we can get a move
on to that chicken casserole.

26:13.806 --> 26:15.673
Come on kids, let's
get it moving.

26:15.675 --> 26:19.977
- You'll lose even though
we had Simon on our team.

26:27.720 --> 26:30.120
(loud strike)

26:37.863 --> 26:38.929
- Like, yay.

26:41.367 --> 26:45.736
- That's a foul, that's
clearly a foul ball.

26:45.738 --> 26:50.608
- That's right, Emilia's
last hit was a foul ball.

26:50.610 --> 26:53.177
It was the third and last
out of Emilia's team.

26:53.179 --> 26:54.612
(whistle blows)

26:54.614 --> 26:56.981
Chicken casserole,
this way, please.

26:56.983 --> 26:59.216
(sad music)

27:03.823 --> 27:07.091
- That was some hit,
very interesting.

27:07.093 --> 27:10.227
- Yeah, where did the ball go?

27:10.229 --> 27:13.063
(upbeat music)

27:17.169 --> 27:19.336
(splash)

27:20.873 --> 27:22.039
(glass shatters)

27:22.041 --> 27:24.908
(wind blows)

27:24.910 --> 27:27.978
(rumbling)

27:27.980 --> 27:31.048
(suspenseful music)

27:38.924 --> 27:41.825
- It's from the
elementary school.

27:45.297 --> 27:49.767
- Ugh, the sound barrier
broke some windows.

27:49.769 --> 27:51.001
- Here too?

27:51.003 --> 27:53.070
All over the school and
we're over the budget.

27:53.072 --> 27:55.072
Come in kitchen,
Prince one calling.

27:55.074 --> 27:56.740
Cancel the meatballs tomorrow,
just mashed potatoes.

27:56.742 --> 27:58.108
Ricky, potatoes only.

27:58.110 --> 28:00.778
- Simon, do superpowers exist?

28:02.014 --> 28:04.915
- No, why are you asking?

28:04.917 --> 28:07.151
- I can't really tell you.

28:12.058 --> 28:13.023
Hi.

28:13.025 --> 28:14.291
- Hi.

28:14.293 --> 28:16.360
Listen, I gotta
ask you something.

28:16.362 --> 28:18.028
We've all been wondering.

28:18.030 --> 28:19.797
Are you two together?

28:19.799 --> 28:21.098
- What do you mean, us two?

28:21.100 --> 28:22.299
- Well, you and Simon.

28:22.301 --> 28:23.200
- No way.

28:24.303 --> 28:26.503
- Poor Simon, everyone
thinks he's a freak.

28:26.505 --> 28:29.106
- I heard that all he
eats at home is seaweed.

28:29.108 --> 28:31.041
(girls laugh)

28:31.043 --> 28:32.726
Can you imagine?

28:32.727 --> 28:34.410
- I guess he's kind
of, kind of, different.

28:34.413 --> 28:36.747
(girls laugh)

28:36.749 --> 28:37.414
Bye.

28:37.416 --> 28:38.515
- Bye.

28:38.517 --> 28:41.085
(sad music)

28:43.155 --> 28:44.388
- [Newsman] We're not sure
- [Pertti] Hey.

28:44.390 --> 28:46.857
about the situation at the cove.

28:46.859 --> 28:48.125
- [Pertti] Hi babe.

28:48.127 --> 28:49.727
- Hey.

28:49.729 --> 28:50.961
- [Newsman] Coming in overnight

28:50.963 --> 28:52.863
but we do know
- Hi there boo boo.

28:52.865 --> 28:53.964
- [Newsman] property
has been damaged

28:53.966 --> 28:55.899
and several boats
have been vandalized

28:55.901 --> 28:56.900
and released from their anchors.

28:56.902 --> 28:58.085
- Hey, Simon's dad is on

28:58.086 --> 28:59.269
the news.
- [Newsman] We have one more

28:59.271 --> 29:00.637
(mumbles) standing by.

29:00.638 --> 29:02.004
Sir, can you let us know
what's happening today?

29:02.007 --> 29:04.041
- No vandalism before but
only the butter factory

29:04.043 --> 29:09.113
polluting the algae, reeds
and other vegetable goodies

29:09.815 --> 29:11.081
from the sea.

29:11.083 --> 29:13.150
Horsetail and salt marsh
have disappeared, well,

29:13.152 --> 29:14.318
all together.

29:15.888 --> 29:18.322
- [Newsman] The police have
no clues of the perpetrators.

29:18.324 --> 29:20.991
- Those punks should be
sent to juvenile hall.

29:20.993 --> 29:23.260
- You don't know that, they
could be adults as well.

29:23.262 --> 29:26.263
- Why would an adult
do something so stupid?

29:26.265 --> 29:29.032
- Why would an adult wear a bib?

29:29.034 --> 29:32.136
- Well, cleanliness
matters, dear.

29:32.138 --> 29:33.804
- [Newsman] The
situation is underlined

29:33.806 --> 29:37.074
by an explosion
beneath the surface.

29:37.076 --> 29:38.475
The police are investigating

29:38.477 --> 29:40.844
however, Meteorological
Institute explained

29:40.846 --> 29:42.179
(voice drowns out by Pertti)

29:42.181 --> 29:45.048
- Someone just hit a
baseball into the water.

29:45.050 --> 29:48.585
- [Newsman] Up next,
financial news.

29:48.587 --> 29:51.822
(suspenseful music)

29:57.062 --> 30:00.097
(guinea pig squeaks)

30:00.099 --> 30:03.000
(uplifting music)

30:24.089 --> 30:25.856
- Super fur ball.

30:25.858 --> 30:27.491
It's super fur ball.

30:27.493 --> 30:28.992
No going.

30:28.994 --> 30:30.294
Are you deaf?

30:30.296 --> 30:32.462
Wait up super fur ball.

30:32.464 --> 30:34.131
(herring grunts)

30:34.133 --> 30:35.365
Super fur ball.

30:45.110 --> 30:47.644
(mumbles) wait.

30:51.217 --> 30:53.584
I'm so tired (mumbles).

30:53.586 --> 30:56.019
Down here, (mumbles).

30:56.021 --> 30:59.289
I know you're the
super fur ball.

30:59.291 --> 31:01.191
- What are you?

31:01.193 --> 31:02.259
- What am I?

31:02.261 --> 31:04.161
Blazing Belinis.

31:04.163 --> 31:07.231
- You talk?

31:07.232 --> 31:10.300
- Yes, though they keep saying
herrings are a quiet bunch.

31:10.970 --> 31:12.102
- Is this kind of a joke?

31:12.104 --> 31:13.170
- Niet.

31:13.172 --> 31:15.372
We need your help,
super fur ball.

31:15.374 --> 31:18.575
You know this cove near here
in the Baltic Sea, yeah?

31:18.577 --> 31:20.143
- Yes of course.

31:21.146 --> 31:23.080
It was on the news.

31:23.082 --> 31:25.048
- The young herrings are so mad.

31:25.050 --> 31:27.584
Soon something
terrible will happen.

31:27.586 --> 31:29.987
- Is it you herrings
that are making the mess?

31:29.989 --> 31:33.323
- Oh look, she's talking to
her friends in the sewer.

31:33.325 --> 31:36.994
- So, it's time for,
what is it time for?

31:38.430 --> 31:40.931
Will they use their
first lifeline?

31:40.933 --> 31:43.333
It's ask the teacher or me.

31:43.335 --> 31:44.434
Yes, they're using it.

31:44.436 --> 31:45.636
The correct answer.

31:45.638 --> 31:48.238
Biology projects
about the Baltic Sea.

31:48.240 --> 31:49.573
And how do they go about it?

31:49.575 --> 31:52.476
Very lazy hands here today.

31:52.478 --> 31:54.344
You'll do it in pairs.

31:55.714 --> 31:58.015
In a moment, we'll be
choosing project partners.

31:58.017 --> 31:59.249
Does everyone understand?

31:59.251 --> 32:00.250
Okay, now.

32:01.954 --> 32:03.921
Do we have anyone
without a partner?

32:03.923 --> 32:04.922
Hm?

32:04.924 --> 32:06.556
Ah, Emilia and Simon.

32:07.960 --> 32:09.993
- Aw, look at the cute couple.

32:09.995 --> 32:11.595
Will it be a church wedding?

32:11.597 --> 32:14.164
- I'll do mine alone.

32:14.166 --> 32:15.699
- I see.

32:15.701 --> 32:17.534
So, Simon has to
do his alone too?

32:17.536 --> 32:18.702
Is that okay?

32:18.704 --> 32:19.603
Fine.

32:21.173 --> 32:24.141
Emilia, take water systems
and Simon, islands.

32:24.143 --> 32:25.142
- Teacher.

32:25.144 --> 32:26.143
- Yes Emilia?

32:26.145 --> 32:27.511
- What do herrings need?

32:27.513 --> 32:29.947
- Well, that's for you to
find out on this project.

32:29.949 --> 32:31.181
- I kinda need to
know right now.

32:31.183 --> 32:33.583
What do herrings need the most?

32:33.585 --> 32:36.086
- Well I guess,
like all other fish,

32:36.088 --> 32:37.087
(phone beeps)

32:37.089 --> 32:38.422
clean water most of all.

32:38.424 --> 32:43.160
And what have we said about
messaging during lessons?

32:43.529 --> 32:44.328
(camera clicks)

32:44.330 --> 32:45.462
(students laugh)

32:45.464 --> 32:47.264
Where is our
degenerate going now?

32:47.266 --> 32:50.267
I'll give you a hint, lots of
fresh air, he knows it well.

32:50.269 --> 32:52.469
Go outside and take a lap.

32:54.006 --> 32:56.340
- Hey, look at that.

32:56.342 --> 32:59.209
Oh my god, let's take a picture.

33:05.317 --> 33:08.185
(kids laugh)

33:08.187 --> 33:09.720
(sad music)

33:09.722 --> 33:12.422
- Here comes the aardvark.

33:12.424 --> 33:13.490
- Oh my god.

33:13.492 --> 33:15.492
- Who did this artwork?

33:17.096 --> 33:18.261
If we can't find
the guilty party

33:18.263 --> 33:19.629
then everyone will clean.

33:19.631 --> 33:20.630
Anturo?

33:20.632 --> 33:21.631
- It was her.

33:21.633 --> 33:23.166
- No no.

33:23.168 --> 33:24.234
- Emilia.

33:24.236 --> 33:26.203
- Of course it was
Emilia, we saw her.

33:26.205 --> 33:27.704
- Yeah, we saw her.

33:32.277 --> 33:34.344
- Well if Emilia won't confess

33:34.346 --> 33:36.747
then it's gonna be altogether.

33:40.252 --> 33:42.352
- Thanks a lot Emilia.

33:42.354 --> 33:45.288
- Yeah Emilia, some
friend you are.

33:45.290 --> 33:47.691
- Teacher, it was me.

33:47.693 --> 33:49.493
- One, two, three, bang.

33:49.495 --> 33:50.694
There we have it.

33:50.696 --> 33:52.362
Simon will wash it.

33:54.033 --> 33:54.831
Chop, chop.

33:56.368 --> 33:57.734
It's okay to show your feelings,

33:57.736 --> 34:00.470
just not to trash your school.

34:00.472 --> 34:02.339
- Why did you do that?

34:02.341 --> 34:05.442
- They bully me already and
we may have to move anyway.

34:05.444 --> 34:06.743
- What, why?

34:06.745 --> 34:08.678
- No more clients at the cove.

34:08.680 --> 34:10.714
The whole place is
polluted and vandalized.

34:10.716 --> 34:12.349
- No way, where to?

34:14.386 --> 34:16.353
- Why do you care anyhow?

34:24.563 --> 34:26.163
- Am I going crazy?

34:26.165 --> 34:28.732
Herrings are asking for my help.

34:30.636 --> 34:34.337
(guinea pig squeaks)

34:34.339 --> 34:35.472
Or am I crazy already?

34:35.474 --> 34:37.307
I'm talking to a guinea pig.

34:37.309 --> 34:40.444
(guinea pig squeaks)

34:43.248 --> 34:46.316
(suspenseful music)

35:04.703 --> 35:07.871
(guinea pig squeaks)

35:12.845 --> 35:15.378
- Emilia and I are
going to the pool first.

35:15.380 --> 35:17.380
Where are the towels?

35:20.686 --> 35:23.854
(guinea pig squeaks)

35:32.898 --> 35:36.299
(inspirational music)

35:37.469 --> 35:40.437
(guinea pig squeaks)

35:50.816 --> 35:53.483
(Emilia screams)

35:53.485 --> 35:54.551
- Oh no.

36:01.426 --> 36:04.427
More horrible than I remember.

36:04.429 --> 36:06.329
Of all superheroes, why do
I have to be guinea pig

36:06.331 --> 36:07.664
with these teeth?

36:10.669 --> 36:12.736
Sorry, nothing personal.

36:14.673 --> 36:16.840
- Emilia, it's pool time.

36:18.610 --> 36:20.277
- No, don't come in.

36:20.279 --> 36:22.946
- Hey, is everything
okay in there?

36:22.948 --> 36:24.915
- [Emilia] Everything's fine.

36:24.917 --> 36:26.816
I'm doing my homework.

37:00.219 --> 37:02.686
(Emilia gasps)

37:04.790 --> 37:07.591
(Emilia screams)

37:07.593 --> 37:08.625
- Emilia?

37:08.627 --> 37:10.727
Are you all right?

37:10.729 --> 37:12.529
Is everything okay?

37:13.498 --> 37:14.497
Come on, (mumbles).

37:14.499 --> 37:15.632
- No, no, no.

37:16.835 --> 37:18.401
I don't have time.

37:18.403 --> 37:19.402
- What do you mean?

37:19.404 --> 37:20.303
Emilia.

37:21.540 --> 37:23.773
Come on, it's time to relax.

37:35.554 --> 37:38.688
Emilia, where did
you fly off to now?

37:41.493 --> 37:43.994
Seriously Emilia,
no joking around.

37:43.996 --> 37:44.894
Emilia.

37:45.797 --> 37:48.999
(toilet flushes)

37:49.001 --> 37:51.568
What on earth are you doing?

37:54.439 --> 37:58.074
Emilia what's going
on, are you okay?

37:58.076 --> 37:59.476
There you are.

38:00.746 --> 38:01.578
What're you doing?

38:01.580 --> 38:02.712
- Biology.

38:03.849 --> 38:06.916
- I see you bought
the teeth and ears.

38:06.918 --> 38:07.917
Cute.

38:07.919 --> 38:10.387
Wear them for the carnival.

38:11.490 --> 38:13.723
(Emilia sighs)

38:13.725 --> 38:14.791
- Well then.

38:15.927 --> 38:18.061
I guess I'm super fur ball now.

38:18.063 --> 38:23.300
I can handle those herrings
and Simon doesn't have to move.

38:24.069 --> 38:25.669
It's a bit lame
to be a guinea pig

38:25.671 --> 38:28.071
but still, I'm a super hero.

38:29.875 --> 38:33.777
But first, I need to
work on my flying skills.

38:34.646 --> 38:37.881
(inspirational music)

38:39.618 --> 38:42.519
(Emilia grunts)

38:48.460 --> 38:49.793
- Hi.

38:49.795 --> 38:53.930
- Hi, so if you could fly,
how would you fly straight?

38:53.932 --> 38:56.566
- Birds have tails,
witches have a broom

38:56.568 --> 38:58.368
and superman has a cape.

38:58.370 --> 38:59.669
- [Simon's Dad] Aha!
- Why?

38:59.671 --> 39:01.438
- And if you only have a scarf?

39:01.440 --> 39:02.672
- Why only a scarf?

39:02.674 --> 39:04.741
- I can't tell you
right now, bye.

39:07.145 --> 39:08.778
- Look at this.

39:08.780 --> 39:10.146
It was all good yesterday.

39:21.760 --> 39:24.728
(Emilia screams)

39:32.871 --> 39:35.672
(Emilia screams)

39:37.142 --> 39:40.543
(inspirational music)

40:23.655 --> 40:26.623
(Emilia screams)

40:31.797 --> 40:33.530
- A running wheel.

40:35.534 --> 40:38.067
(people scream)

40:53.952 --> 40:55.118
Boo.

40:55.120 --> 40:57.253
(laughs)

40:58.190 --> 40:59.055
Wee!

41:06.665 --> 41:08.798
(Emilia coughs)

41:08.800 --> 41:09.866
Sorry!

41:11.236 --> 41:12.569
The herrings.

41:13.672 --> 41:14.571
Woo-hoo!

41:17.242 --> 41:18.942
(phone rings)

41:18.944 --> 41:20.176
Hi there mom.

41:20.178 --> 41:23.112
I'm at, no we're
not on the computer.

41:23.114 --> 41:26.015
The homework is almost done.

41:26.017 --> 41:26.916
Bye.

41:28.820 --> 41:32.889
Woo-hoo!
(inspirational music)

41:37.829 --> 41:39.963
(splash)

41:41.066 --> 41:44.868
It's cold, it's cold,
it's really really cold.

41:48.173 --> 41:50.807
All right, operation herring.

42:02.754 --> 42:03.820
Hello?

42:09.628 --> 42:10.994
- Oh you made it,
nice to see you.

42:10.996 --> 42:13.897
- Sorry for not
getting you then.

42:13.899 --> 42:16.866
I couldn't figure out
a talking herring.

42:16.868 --> 42:20.837
I thought I was going, uh,
you wanted to talk to me?

42:20.839 --> 42:24.073
- Yes, we have a gulf
shore catastrophe.

42:24.943 --> 42:26.209
(herrings chatter)

42:26.211 --> 42:29.345
Quiet (mumbles), go do
some herrings things,

42:29.347 --> 42:32.148
you (mumbles).

42:32.150 --> 42:35.852
(herrings chatter)

42:35.854 --> 42:38.588
- Uh, what's that gross stuff?

42:38.590 --> 42:42.759
- Oh, that, all the
time, that dura lock pipe

42:42.761 --> 42:44.661
keeps spewing poison.

42:44.663 --> 42:47.063
It's very difficult
for us herrings.

42:47.065 --> 42:50.366
Usually we're easy
going, (mumbles)

42:50.368 --> 42:53.136
but this is what poison
does to herrings.

42:53.138 --> 42:55.672
We become mean and angry.

42:55.674 --> 42:58.041
(mumbles) look.

42:58.043 --> 42:59.909
That unsuspecting
school of perches

42:59.911 --> 43:02.178
moved here a few weeks ago.

43:02.180 --> 43:04.147
We used to be like that,

43:04.149 --> 43:06.849
swimming happily
into one direction.

43:06.851 --> 43:09.652
But now all of that is
(speaks foreign language).

43:09.654 --> 43:12.055
The whole gang is ocean crazy.

43:13.358 --> 43:14.891
- Couldn't you find
another part of the ocean?

43:14.893 --> 43:16.960
- The perches have
been all over the sea.

43:16.962 --> 43:19.696
Even worse pollution everywhere.

43:19.698 --> 43:22.966
We have to end the poison
from entering our gills.

43:22.968 --> 43:24.934
You have to remember,

43:25.870 --> 43:29.005
a poisoned herring
is an angry herring.

43:29.007 --> 43:31.374
An old saying in the sea.

43:31.376 --> 43:34.043
When a rowboat comes,
it's the worst.

43:34.045 --> 43:35.778
It's a halloballu.

43:37.215 --> 43:40.383
(herrings scream)

43:40.385 --> 43:42.251
- So, how can I help you guys?

43:42.253 --> 43:45.121
- We have to get out of here.

43:45.123 --> 43:46.022
Anywhere.

43:54.899 --> 43:57.433
(playful music)

44:19.157 --> 44:22.458
(Emilia gasps in fear)

44:37.075 --> 44:39.976
(Pertti sniffs)

44:41.913 --> 44:45.081
(Emilia gasps in fear)

45:16.481 --> 45:17.980
- Hm, mm.

45:17.982 --> 45:20.783
(Emilia gasps)

45:22.887 --> 45:24.954
I almost forgot dessert.

45:36.167 --> 45:37.066
Emilia?

45:41.940 --> 45:43.072
- Yes?

45:43.074 --> 45:44.440
- Did you finish the cake?

45:44.442 --> 45:46.943
I was really looking
forward to eating that.

45:46.945 --> 45:47.944
Oh no, there it is.

45:47.946 --> 45:49.011
Yeah.

45:58.189 --> 45:59.088
Mm-hm.

46:05.497 --> 46:09.165
(Emilia sighs in relief)

46:12.504 --> 46:15.238
(Emilia grunts)

46:21.513 --> 46:24.013
- Oh no, I look so terrib--

46:24.015 --> 46:26.082
terrific, just terrific.

46:28.119 --> 46:30.086
If the herrings won't calm down,

46:30.088 --> 46:34.323
they'll ruin everything and
Simon will have to move.

46:35.593 --> 46:38.294
(guinea pig squeaks)

46:38.296 --> 46:40.930
I have to do something.

46:40.932 --> 46:43.166
(sad music)

47:10.161 --> 47:11.627
(playful music)

47:11.629 --> 47:13.229
- Swim in here.

47:13.231 --> 47:16.165
- No (mumbles), no
one to fight with.

47:16.167 --> 47:19.168
(herrings chatter)

47:26.010 --> 47:28.344
- What is that smell?

47:28.346 --> 47:30.046
- How's the temperature?

47:30.048 --> 47:32.114
- Ocean, perfect, yes.

47:37.922 --> 47:40.389
- Goodnight and no hullaballoo.

47:49.200 --> 47:53.669
- (herrings in unison)
No, no, no, no.

47:55.006 --> 47:58.407
(herrings sigh in relief)

48:03.681 --> 48:06.415
- Mission accomplished fur ball.

48:10.455 --> 48:13.623
(Emilia's mom yawns)

48:19.097 --> 48:22.431
(Emilia's mom screams)

48:23.534 --> 48:25.534
- What are those?

48:25.536 --> 48:26.669
- They're herrings ma.

48:26.671 --> 48:28.404
- Pertti, come here.

48:32.911 --> 48:34.210
- Oh wow, fish.

48:34.212 --> 48:35.912
- They're called herrings.

48:35.914 --> 48:37.713
- Why are they in our bathtub?

48:37.715 --> 48:39.482
- Well, I have this
biology project

48:39.484 --> 48:42.418
and I have to study the growth
and behavior of herrings.

48:42.420 --> 48:43.452
- Oh, they look so good.

48:43.454 --> 48:44.620
You should fry them.

48:44.622 --> 48:47.990
- No, you're not
gonna fry them, okay?

48:47.992 --> 48:50.960
- Crab and cream cheese
filling sounds so good.

48:50.962 --> 48:52.428
Oh and instead of rye flour,

48:52.430 --> 48:55.431
bread them with
crisp bread crumbs.

48:56.467 --> 48:57.667
Do we have crispy bread?

48:57.669 --> 49:00.703
- No frying them
and no crispy bread.

49:02.140 --> 49:04.240
- Two days and then
the bathtub is empty.

49:04.242 --> 49:06.609
- But mom, do you want
me to fail my project?

49:06.611 --> 49:08.978
I won't get in to high
school or university

49:08.980 --> 49:10.279
and then I'll end
up on the streets.

49:10.281 --> 49:11.314
- Two days, okay?

49:11.316 --> 49:13.049
End of discussion.

49:14.285 --> 49:16.218
- [Herring] Oh, this
is so much better.

49:16.220 --> 49:17.620
- [Pertti] Babe, I can't
find the crispy bread.

49:17.622 --> 49:19.221
- [Emilia's Mom]
Are you serious?

49:19.223 --> 49:22.992
We are not frying
anything from the bathtub.

49:22.994 --> 49:24.627
- Thank you Emilia.

49:24.629 --> 49:27.496
We feel so much
better and cleaner.

49:27.498 --> 49:29.565
- What do you
herrings like to eat?

49:31.469 --> 49:32.168
Porridge?

49:32.170 --> 49:33.302
- No

49:33.304 --> 49:34.303
- Cereal?

49:34.305 --> 49:35.304
- Uh-uh (in disagreement).

49:35.306 --> 49:36.305
- Or maybe yogurt?

49:36.307 --> 49:37.373
- Yuck.

49:37.375 --> 49:38.741
I am wondering if you have...

49:38.743 --> 49:41.077
- Dad always has
animal plankton.

49:41.079 --> 49:42.144
- Thank you.

49:42.146 --> 49:43.479
- What do you need it for?

49:43.481 --> 49:45.548
- It's just something, so
you don't have to move.

49:45.550 --> 49:47.116
- What do you mean?

49:47.118 --> 49:48.684
Fine, don't tell me.

49:51.189 --> 49:52.221
- What's this?

49:52.223 --> 49:53.456
You're bringing
algae to school now?

49:53.458 --> 49:54.991
- You can't bring it to school.

49:54.993 --> 49:56.759
- It's not algae, it's plankton.

49:56.761 --> 49:58.260
Now give it back.

50:02.000 --> 50:04.200
- Simon, why did you do that?

50:04.202 --> 50:06.002
- Shame on you Simon.

50:07.438 --> 50:09.005
- Who made this mess out here?

50:09.007 --> 50:09.805
Who did it?

50:11.609 --> 50:13.042
Is it true?

50:13.044 --> 50:14.010
Was it him?

50:19.717 --> 50:21.183
- Greasy always win.

50:21.185 --> 50:24.387
He can do anything and
he's everyone's favorite.

50:24.389 --> 50:26.322
He always has cool stuff.

50:26.324 --> 50:30.126
His dad owns the butter
factory down by the cove.

50:30.128 --> 50:32.428
He buys weird stuff
for the school.

50:32.430 --> 50:34.697
He's probably the
richest man in town,

50:34.699 --> 50:37.099
arranges all kinds of events.

50:37.101 --> 50:39.368
(rock music)

50:41.272 --> 50:44.807
- [Newsman] Good
news from the Baltic.

50:44.809 --> 50:47.476
The vandalism at
the cove has ended.

50:47.478 --> 50:49.779
Although the police did
not find the perpetrator,

50:49.781 --> 50:52.248
- Are the herrings still
swimming around in our bathtub?

50:52.250 --> 50:54.683
- Well, I have no other
place to put them.

50:54.685 --> 50:56.285
I don't know what to do.

50:56.287 --> 50:57.620
- Take them wherever you want,

50:57.622 --> 51:01.257
the tub must be
empty in the morning.

51:01.259 --> 51:02.224
- Ta-da!

51:02.226 --> 51:03.359
Tickets to a spa.

51:03.361 --> 51:04.860
- A spa?

51:04.862 --> 51:06.362
Are you serious?

51:06.364 --> 51:07.663
- Yeah, I won a raffle at work.

51:07.665 --> 51:10.332
Five tickets, can
you believe it?

51:10.334 --> 51:11.801
- I'm so excited!

51:14.205 --> 51:16.872
Emilia, we have
two extra tickets.

51:16.874 --> 51:19.775
Would you like to
ask Simon to go?

51:23.347 --> 51:25.848
(phone rings)

51:31.089 --> 51:34.390
- He's not even
answering my phone calls.

51:35.426 --> 51:37.726
I'm gonna ask someone else.

51:39.430 --> 51:42.264
Dad has a new
girlfriend, Annelilla.

51:42.266 --> 51:45.167
I call her cotton
swab Annelilla.

51:45.169 --> 51:49.738
Dad doesn't like the name and
doesn't get the reference.

51:49.740 --> 51:52.641
- Hi Emmy, hey (laughs).

51:52.643 --> 51:54.276
Ah, hi.

51:54.278 --> 51:55.411
- Hey, you made it.

51:55.413 --> 51:57.279
- Oh, yeah.

51:57.281 --> 51:58.914
- Hey, good to see ya!

51:58.916 --> 52:01.717
- Okay, what's going on
with all the hugging?

52:01.719 --> 52:04.386
So unnatural, so uncivilized.

52:04.388 --> 52:06.789
- All right, let's go swimming.

52:06.791 --> 52:07.890
- Wait, hold on.

52:07.892 --> 52:09.525
I left something in there.

52:09.527 --> 52:10.893
- What?

52:10.895 --> 52:12.795
Just remember to lock.

52:22.206 --> 52:23.639
- There's a lot of
human plankton here.

52:23.641 --> 52:26.876
On TV, I saw small fish eat
dry skin from peoples feet.

52:26.878 --> 52:28.410
- Sounds delicious.

52:28.412 --> 52:29.712
Who's hungry?

52:29.714 --> 52:33.382
Everyone, let's go, let's
go, it's time to eat.

52:34.785 --> 52:36.452
(herrings chattering)

52:36.454 --> 52:39.388
Chlorine, no, chlorine is
the worst poison for us.

52:39.390 --> 52:42.925
We go totally
crazy, hullaballoo.

52:42.927 --> 52:46.328
Ah, everyone back,
everyone back.

52:46.330 --> 52:48.797
This is no good, this
is no good at all.

52:48.799 --> 52:50.399
Everyone, ah!

52:50.401 --> 52:53.536
(everyone screaming)

52:56.507 --> 52:59.308
- Get back into the barrel now!

53:00.444 --> 53:02.178
Hey, get back now.

53:06.184 --> 53:06.916
- Emilia!

53:15.960 --> 53:19.295
(herrings screaming)

53:20.631 --> 53:24.633
- Well, we don't want to
shut out any customers

53:25.803 --> 53:28.938
but herrings don't
tolerate chlorine.

53:30.508 --> 53:33.409
- But they could get used to it.

53:33.411 --> 53:36.445
- If we sell people
a luxury spa weekend,

53:36.447 --> 53:38.614
they don't want to be
swimming in fish soup,

53:38.616 --> 53:39.682
now do they?

53:40.985 --> 53:44.853
- But couldn't you maybe
remove the chlorine?

53:44.855 --> 53:46.388
- We are going home now.

53:46.390 --> 53:47.756
So sorry about this.

53:47.758 --> 53:49.325
- That's fine.

53:49.327 --> 53:51.026
And you're welcome
back any other time.

53:51.028 --> 53:53.762
Of course, without the herrings.

53:54.899 --> 53:57.333
- [Man] Sorry ma'am, the
sauna's full of scales.

54:01.305 --> 54:02.538
- Yeah.

54:02.539 --> 54:03.772
And one more thing, just a tip,

54:06.344 --> 54:09.011
children need to
have boundaries.

54:20.524 --> 54:23.826
- How come I can't
trust you to behave?

54:25.296 --> 54:28.030
(sad music)

54:28.032 --> 54:29.832
- Hey Em, cheer up.

54:29.834 --> 54:33.502
Mom was just embarrassed
because of the herring fiasco.

54:33.504 --> 54:34.837
- But she was so angry.

54:34.839 --> 54:38.574
- She only gets mad
because she loves you.

54:40.978 --> 54:43.545
- Mom must have loved you a lot.

54:43.547 --> 54:44.546
- Why?

54:44.548 --> 54:45.714
Why do you say that?

54:45.716 --> 54:47.583
- She was always so mad at you.

54:47.585 --> 54:51.020
- (laughs) She
had other reasons.

54:51.022 --> 54:53.088
- Grownups are so weird.

54:54.358 --> 54:57.393
- That's true, you
can't understand them.

54:57.395 --> 54:59.695
There is one thing about mom.

55:06.637 --> 55:09.672
- Simon, I tried calling you.

55:09.674 --> 55:12.308
- Sorry, I must've missed it.

55:14.045 --> 55:15.611
- What do you have in there?

55:15.613 --> 55:17.079
You can't bring
that in to school.

55:17.081 --> 55:18.580
- It's my biology project.

55:18.582 --> 55:20.015
- Project?

55:20.017 --> 55:21.083
(herrings chattering)

55:21.085 --> 55:22.117
What is in there?

55:22.119 --> 55:23.552
Get that thing away right now

55:23.554 --> 55:25.921
or the janitor
will take it away.

55:25.923 --> 55:26.822
Garry?

55:28.693 --> 55:29.925
(herring sighs)

55:29.927 --> 55:33.462
- I'm sorry but I can't
think of another way.

55:33.464 --> 55:35.464
I have to take you
back, do you understand?

55:35.466 --> 55:39.101
- Yeah, big herring, not
a cry baby (mumbles).

55:39.103 --> 55:40.803
(herring cries)

55:40.805 --> 55:43.639
(herring speaks in
foreign language)

55:43.641 --> 55:47.776
- I'm so sorry, but what
else could I have done?

55:47.778 --> 55:50.612
- Emilia, you did
everything you could.

55:50.614 --> 55:52.414
You tried to help, thank you.

55:52.416 --> 55:55.017
We have to solve
this problem alone.

55:55.019 --> 55:57.853
There might be a
big hullaballoo.

55:58.989 --> 56:00.689
- This is not cool at all.

56:00.691 --> 56:02.658
Simon won't take my calls.

56:02.660 --> 56:05.794
He doesn't even sit
with me at lunch.

56:06.630 --> 56:08.130
- Have some more.

56:09.467 --> 56:12.835
You're so skinny, the
winds gonna break you.

56:12.837 --> 56:14.636
Where's Simon?

56:14.638 --> 56:16.805
Now there's a skinny kid.

56:16.807 --> 56:18.707
- [Emilia] Kitchen
Donna is right.

56:18.709 --> 56:21.810
Simon should eat
something, he's too thin.

56:21.812 --> 56:23.679
Once, Simon was
waiting for a bus

56:23.681 --> 56:26.382
and a huge gust of
wind swept him up.

56:26.384 --> 56:28.150
It flew him against
the window in Ikea

56:28.152 --> 56:30.652
and he got stuck there.

56:30.654 --> 56:32.388
The police came
over to detach Simon

56:32.390 --> 56:33.889
but it wasn't easy.

56:33.891 --> 56:37.860
Simon got so flat, it
was hard to stand him up.

56:40.598 --> 56:43.165
All kinds of cool stuff
keep happening with Simon.

56:43.167 --> 56:45.567
- Listen, I gotta ask this.

56:45.569 --> 56:47.636
What's the hold up here?

56:51.642 --> 56:54.042
(sad music)

56:55.446 --> 56:56.712
- What happened to you Emilia?

56:56.714 --> 56:57.746
- Nothing.

56:57.748 --> 56:58.814
- Nothing?

57:02.753 --> 57:05.154
Maybe telling me would help?

57:06.624 --> 57:08.457
- The water is so
dirty in the cove

57:08.459 --> 57:10.726
that Simon's dad has
to close their stand,

57:10.728 --> 57:13.529
then Simon will move away.

57:13.531 --> 57:14.630
- I'm sorry honey.

57:14.632 --> 57:16.031
- It doesn't matter anyway.

57:16.033 --> 57:19.701
He doesn't want to
be my friend anymore.

57:19.703 --> 57:22.037
- Even if Simon does move away,

57:22.039 --> 57:25.641
you'll still be best
friends, sweetie.

57:25.643 --> 57:27.109
That's what counts.

57:31.782 --> 57:33.982
And listen, it's not
too late to make up

57:33.984 --> 57:35.684
before he moves away.

57:35.686 --> 57:37.719
A good friend will forgive.

57:37.721 --> 57:40.856
Even dad and I
don't fight anymore.

57:43.594 --> 57:46.795
- You're right mom, I'll
talk to him tomorrow

57:46.797 --> 57:47.629
and apologize.

57:47.631 --> 57:48.730
- That's good.

57:48.732 --> 57:51.633
- Oh, and dad told me
something about you.

57:51.635 --> 57:54.536
(uplifting music)

57:58.142 --> 58:01.810
- And you're the best
daughter in the world.

58:03.113 --> 58:04.880
- [Emilia] Maybe
we've grown apart

58:04.882 --> 58:09.084
like they say in Cotton
Swab Annelilla's magazines.

58:09.086 --> 58:11.753
How do you grow apart?

58:11.755 --> 58:14.790
Why can't everybody
just be friends?

58:14.792 --> 58:18.160
Why are some more
embarrassing than others?

58:18.162 --> 58:21.063
Oh no, if Simon has to move away

58:21.065 --> 58:23.732
then we'll really grow apart.

58:27.671 --> 58:30.839
- Hey, my night shift
is starting soon.

58:35.112 --> 58:36.545
- [Newsman] And lastly,

58:36.547 --> 58:39.548
an update on one of
our ongoing stories.

58:39.550 --> 58:43.118
The situation at the Baltic
Bay is heating up again.

58:43.120 --> 58:45.821
Vandalism in the
bay of East Helsinki

58:45.823 --> 58:48.056
has returned with a vengeance.

58:48.058 --> 58:50.292
Last night, a food
stand disappeared.

58:50.294 --> 58:51.660
- What in the world?

58:51.662 --> 58:53.762
- [Newsman] The police
have no suspects.

58:53.764 --> 58:56.899
- We don't have any suspects,
this is a total mystery.

58:56.901 --> 58:59.101
- Yeah, we're on
our way to school.

58:59.103 --> 59:00.702
- And then the fish pushed

59:00.704 --> 59:02.037
the stand into the water.
- So many fish.

59:02.039 --> 59:03.171
- So many fish.

59:03.173 --> 59:04.740
- I lost everything.

59:04.742 --> 59:07.843
Reed porridge, reed
patties, plankton bars.

59:07.845 --> 59:09.578
What will I sell my customers?

59:09.580 --> 59:10.913
What will we eat?

59:23.928 --> 59:26.895
(herrings grunt)

59:31.235 --> 59:33.101
- [Emilia] Where
on earth is Simon?

59:33.103 --> 59:34.770
He's an hour late.

59:34.772 --> 59:37.839
He's never late
when we have a test.

59:39.176 --> 59:40.842
- [Newsman] The city
is being vandalized,

59:40.844 --> 59:43.178
the water supply
system is broken.

59:43.180 --> 59:45.981
It's difficult to
investigate, the sea is busy

59:45.983 --> 59:49.184
under the surface but the
divers don't dare go in.

59:49.186 --> 59:51.186
- We're closely (cuts out).

59:51.188 --> 59:52.688
- Hey it's my dad,
look, he's on TV.

59:52.690 --> 59:55.391
Yeah dad, you're the man.

59:55.392 --> 59:58.093
- It's totally absurd to
claim that our butter factory

59:58.095 --> 1:00:02.164
has anything to do with
the problems in the bay.

1:00:03.267 --> 1:00:04.733
- [Woman] Well this
is very strange,

1:00:04.735 --> 1:00:06.668
I've lived here all my life and

1:00:06.670 --> 1:00:07.703
- What're you doing?

1:00:07.705 --> 1:00:08.904
Where's Simon?

1:00:08.905 --> 1:00:10.104
- Simon is not coming
in to school today,

1:00:10.107 --> 1:00:11.073
he's moving away.

1:00:11.075 --> 1:00:12.641
- No, he can't.

1:00:12.643 --> 1:00:14.276
I didn't have time to
apologize or even talk to him.

1:00:16.213 --> 1:00:17.012
Hey.

1:00:17.013 --> 1:00:17.812
Hey, I know what
causes all this.

1:00:17.815 --> 1:00:19.014
- You do, really?

1:00:19.016 --> 1:00:20.882
Give me names.

1:00:20.884 --> 1:00:23.085
- The power is gone because
the herrings have done

1:00:23.087 --> 1:00:24.186
something under the sea.

1:00:24.188 --> 1:00:25.287
(laughs)

1:00:25.289 --> 1:00:26.355
- Ah, I see.

1:00:27.691 --> 1:00:29.091
Please explain in more detail.

1:00:29.093 --> 1:00:30.292
- The herrings are getting sick

1:00:30.294 --> 1:00:31.927
because poison is
pouring into the cove.

1:00:31.929 --> 1:00:34.963
They're going totally crazy.

1:00:34.965 --> 1:00:37.399
- We need an extra broadcast
and an emergency bulletin.

1:00:37.401 --> 1:00:38.734
We need the radio back on.

1:00:38.736 --> 1:00:40.869
Come on, cloppity-clop,
hoppity-hop.

1:00:40.871 --> 1:00:41.737
Come on.

1:00:48.212 --> 1:00:52.114
I keep a spare
generator for emergency.

1:00:52.116 --> 1:00:54.216
The radio will never die.

1:00:56.787 --> 1:00:57.653
Yeehaw!

1:00:59.089 --> 1:01:01.890
Our guest today, on
our Prince One radio,

1:01:01.892 --> 1:01:05.193
is little Emelia
Neeman, with hot news

1:01:05.195 --> 1:01:06.461
about our power outage.

1:01:06.463 --> 1:01:08.430
Go ahead Emilia.

1:01:08.432 --> 1:01:10.899
- Yes, the power is off
because the herrings are--

1:01:10.901 --> 1:01:12.901
- Yeehaw, talk about herrings,

1:01:12.903 --> 1:01:15.137
let's listen to some
herring music now.

1:01:15.139 --> 1:01:18.373
(herring music plays)

1:01:20.310 --> 1:01:25.047
Emilia, you need to speak up
because the generators, uh.

1:01:26.383 --> 1:01:29.117
- Hullaballoo, hullaballoo,
hullaballoo, hullaballoo

1:01:29.119 --> 1:01:33.021
hullaballoo, hullaballoo,
hullaballoo, hullaballoo.

1:01:33.023 --> 1:01:34.222
(people scream)

1:01:34.224 --> 1:01:39.127
(herrings chanting
hullaballoo in unison)

1:01:55.779 --> 1:01:58.313
(playful music)

1:02:02.920 --> 1:02:05.320
(sad music)

1:02:06.123 --> 1:02:07.022
- Simon?

1:02:08.325 --> 1:02:09.224
Simon?

1:02:12.429 --> 1:02:13.328
Simon?

1:02:17.134 --> 1:02:18.333
Simon?

1:02:18.335 --> 1:02:20.001
- Can I help you with something?

1:02:20.003 --> 1:02:21.236
- Where's Simon?

1:02:21.238 --> 1:02:22.771
- Previous tenants?

1:02:22.773 --> 1:02:24.172
They left already.

1:02:26.877 --> 1:02:28.210
- No.

1:02:28.212 --> 1:02:30.112
They left so suddenly.

1:02:30.114 --> 1:02:32.180
This can't be happening.

1:02:34.184 --> 1:02:38.386
(sniffs) I didn't even get
a chance to say goodbye.

1:02:38.388 --> 1:02:42.357
We were fighting the last
few days, he was mad at me.

1:02:42.359 --> 1:02:43.892
It was all my fault.

1:02:43.894 --> 1:02:46.895
- What was all your fault?

1:02:46.897 --> 1:02:47.829
- Simon!

1:02:47.831 --> 1:02:50.232
I thought you had left already.

1:02:51.535 --> 1:02:54.436
- We left some dry algae
behind, we came back to get it.

1:02:54.438 --> 1:02:55.971
- You can't move away, please.

1:02:55.973 --> 1:02:56.972
- Found it.

1:02:56.974 --> 1:02:58.006
- Hurry.

1:02:58.942 --> 1:03:00.242
Let's get going.

1:03:01.779 --> 1:03:04.279
- Simon, I know what's
causing all these problems

1:03:04.281 --> 1:03:07.115
but it's so strange, you're
not gonna believe me.

1:03:07.117 --> 1:03:08.083
- Try me.

1:03:08.085 --> 1:03:09.151
- Okay.

1:03:09.987 --> 1:03:11.853
So a school of
herrings from the cove

1:03:11.855 --> 1:03:13.889
came to shore to attack people.

1:03:13.891 --> 1:03:18.059
Environmental toxins
mess with their heads.

1:03:18.061 --> 1:03:19.895
We should get them to safety.

1:03:19.897 --> 1:03:21.029
The herrings.

1:03:25.169 --> 1:03:27.435
- Why didn't you say so?

1:03:27.437 --> 1:03:29.037
It's not the first time.

1:03:29.039 --> 1:03:31.173
Environmental toxins
cause behavioral problems.

1:03:31.175 --> 1:03:33.341
There are many pipes
on that sea floor,

1:03:33.343 --> 1:03:35.110
like the one from
the butter factory

1:03:35.112 --> 1:03:37.546
and the main electricity line.

1:03:37.548 --> 1:03:39.181
That's probably what's
causing the problems.

1:03:39.183 --> 1:03:41.183
- The herrings are
eating away at that line.

1:03:41.185 --> 1:03:43.985
Soon, they'll break everything.

1:03:45.122 --> 1:03:47.556
We have to save that cove.

1:03:47.558 --> 1:03:49.891
- (sighs) My dad tried already.

1:03:49.893 --> 1:03:53.562
- We need to calm down
those herrings right away.

1:03:53.564 --> 1:03:54.996
I'll handle the herrings

1:03:54.998 --> 1:03:56.898
so your dad can
open his stand again

1:03:56.900 --> 1:03:59.034
and you guys won't have to move.

1:03:59.036 --> 1:04:01.102
(playful music)

1:04:01.104 --> 1:04:02.504
What can I do?

1:04:02.506 --> 1:04:05.574
How do I calm down
all the herrings?

1:04:07.077 --> 1:04:09.644
(Emilia grunts)

1:04:11.949 --> 1:04:13.615
Why do I always fail?

1:04:15.219 --> 1:04:18.220
- Emilia, you are
a super fur ball.

1:04:19.456 --> 1:04:22.390
Not everyone gets that honor.

1:04:22.392 --> 1:04:24.459
- What can I do as a guinea
pig or whatever it is

1:04:24.461 --> 1:04:25.927
that I turn into?

1:04:25.929 --> 1:04:27.562
I don't want to be
a mega fat fur ball

1:04:27.564 --> 1:04:28.597
with gigantic buck teeth.

1:04:28.599 --> 1:04:30.365
I won't do it.

1:04:30.367 --> 1:04:33.501
- The appearance
is no coincidence.

1:04:33.503 --> 1:04:35.170
Music please.

1:04:35.172 --> 1:04:37.572
(music plays)

1:04:39.142 --> 1:04:42.143
Guinea pigs are cute,
chubby and furry

1:04:42.145 --> 1:04:44.179
so that they can
get close to people,

1:04:44.181 --> 1:04:46.481
especially close to children.

1:04:49.586 --> 1:04:52.454
And you were not made
super fur ball by mistake.

1:04:52.456 --> 1:04:56.424
You are a resourceful child
with a vivid imagination

1:04:56.426 --> 1:04:59.661
and you need to learn
how to be brave.

1:05:01.064 --> 1:05:05.066
Emilia, if you're good
as plain old Emilia,

1:05:05.068 --> 1:05:08.136
you're good as super fur ball.

1:05:09.606 --> 1:05:13.675
Be brave and say the most
beautiful words out loud,

1:05:15.312 --> 1:05:20.215
"I am guinea pig,
super fur ball".

1:05:21.218 --> 1:05:23.685
- I am a fur ball,
a super fur ball.

1:05:23.687 --> 1:05:26.554
I am a fur ball,
a super fur ball.

1:05:26.556 --> 1:05:29.457
I am a fur ball,
a super fur ball

1:05:29.459 --> 1:05:34.029
and I need that water bottle
to be a super fur ball.

1:05:51.214 --> 1:05:54.349
Mom, where's guinea
pig Halonen's bottle?

1:05:54.351 --> 1:05:55.650
Where's that bottle?

1:05:55.652 --> 1:05:57.185
- In the dishwasher.

1:05:57.187 --> 1:05:59.204
- Why is it in there?

1:05:59.205 --> 1:06:01.222
- It wasn't clean then
the power went out.

1:06:01.224 --> 1:06:02.157
- Mom, open it.

1:06:02.159 --> 1:06:03.625
- We can't open it mid cycle.

1:06:03.627 --> 1:06:05.427
We need to wait for the power.

1:06:05.429 --> 1:06:07.562
- There will be no power
if I don't get that bottle

1:06:10.133 --> 1:06:12.150
out of there.

1:06:12.151 --> 1:06:14.168
- Don't be silly, trust
me, you can't open it.

1:06:14.171 --> 1:06:15.670
- What's with all this noise?

1:06:15.672 --> 1:06:17.672
- For some reason, Emilia is
worried about the cleanliness

1:06:17.674 --> 1:06:19.007
of our dishes.

1:06:19.009 --> 1:06:20.241
- I need to get that bottle out.

1:06:20.243 --> 1:06:21.242
- What bottle?

1:06:21.244 --> 1:06:23.678
- It's Halonen's
bottle in there.

1:06:23.680 --> 1:06:28.650
- You can't be shouting like
this in an apartment building.

1:06:28.652 --> 1:06:31.086
- You can't open it mid cycle.

1:06:31.088 --> 1:06:32.487
- All right, all right.

1:06:32.489 --> 1:06:34.155
- All the water will come out.

1:06:34.157 --> 1:06:38.793
- I know what I'm doing, let
me show you how it's done.

1:06:43.233 --> 1:06:46.034
- Thanks Pertti,
you're the best.

1:06:48.638 --> 1:06:53.274
(inspirational music)
- Woops.

1:06:53.276 --> 1:06:54.275
- Here we go.

1:07:08.191 --> 1:07:11.026
(sirens blare)

1:07:15.298 --> 1:07:18.366
(walkie talk voice)

1:07:23.073 --> 1:07:25.240
(phone rings)

1:07:25.242 --> 1:07:27.475
- This is not a good time.

1:07:29.079 --> 1:07:31.413
- Emilia, where are you?

1:07:31.415 --> 1:07:32.480
Did you do your homework?

1:07:32.482 --> 1:07:34.349
- Yes, well, almost.

1:07:34.351 --> 1:07:36.317
- All right, well
don't be too late

1:07:36.319 --> 1:07:37.786
and don't go near the cove.

1:07:37.788 --> 1:07:40.288
There's something unsafe
happening down there, okay?

1:07:40.290 --> 1:07:41.523
- No, of course not mom.

1:07:41.525 --> 1:07:42.757
Bye, gotta go!

1:07:44.261 --> 1:07:45.693
- Make some space,
make some space.

1:07:45.695 --> 1:07:49.330
Clear the area, divers
are coming up now.

1:07:51.201 --> 1:07:53.301
- I'm not going back in.

1:07:53.303 --> 1:07:54.819
- No, no, no.

1:07:54.820 --> 1:07:56.336
The herrings are going
crazy down there.

1:07:56.339 --> 1:07:57.839
- Stop messing
around with the nets,

1:07:57.841 --> 1:07:59.274
we need stronger equipment.

1:07:59.276 --> 1:08:00.341
- I'll go in.

1:08:01.778 --> 1:08:04.212
The sea is my friend, the
sea won't harm a friend.

1:08:04.214 --> 1:08:06.247
- No civilians
inside the perimeter.

1:08:06.249 --> 1:08:07.816
Get him out of here.

1:08:12.622 --> 1:08:15.857
(boat engine rumbles)

1:08:29.606 --> 1:08:31.840
- Bite, bite as hard as you can,

1:08:31.842 --> 1:08:33.441
bite like you've
never bit before.

1:08:33.443 --> 1:08:35.777
- Herrings, I come in peace.

1:08:35.779 --> 1:08:37.278
Please don't attack.

1:08:37.280 --> 1:08:38.913
Let's negotiate,
what could I do?

1:08:38.915 --> 1:08:42.717
- It's too late, we don't want
to live in a sewer anymore.

1:08:42.719 --> 1:08:45.453
This cove is not an open dump.

1:08:47.257 --> 1:08:50.291
We are up to our
gills in this dirt.

1:08:50.293 --> 1:08:52.360
I'm one mad, bad herring

1:08:53.430 --> 1:08:56.865
who's putting an
end to all of this.

1:08:56.867 --> 1:08:57.899
(clank)

1:08:57.901 --> 1:08:59.801
- What was that?

1:08:59.803 --> 1:09:01.236
(speaks gibberish)
What was that?

1:09:01.238 --> 1:09:03.671
- Okay, no more chewing.

1:09:03.673 --> 1:09:05.406
I'll go tell them your demands.

1:09:05.408 --> 1:09:09.377
Not in a sewer, not an
open dump, up to our gills

1:09:10.780 --> 1:09:12.347
and they're mad.

1:09:21.158 --> 1:09:23.158
- Fix the cable and get those
crazy fish out of the water,

1:09:23.160 --> 1:09:24.492
no matter what.

1:09:25.295 --> 1:09:26.461
If they don't stop

1:09:26.463 --> 1:09:27.896
causing havoc
- Hey.

1:09:27.898 --> 1:09:29.831
- we're going to
lose the entire cove.

1:09:29.833 --> 1:09:31.399
Get the big net.

1:09:31.401 --> 1:09:32.300
- Hey.

1:09:33.336 --> 1:09:34.235
Hey!

1:09:35.205 --> 1:09:36.704
- Hey, who are you?

1:09:36.706 --> 1:09:37.605
- Hold on.

1:09:44.314 --> 1:09:46.347
Okay, listen to me.

1:09:46.349 --> 1:09:47.815
If people stop
polluting the sea,

1:09:47.817 --> 1:09:50.218
they'll let the divers
down to fix everything.

1:09:50.220 --> 1:09:51.219
- They?

1:09:51.221 --> 1:09:52.353
- The herrings.

1:09:52.355 --> 1:09:53.488
(officers laugh)

1:09:53.490 --> 1:09:55.223
Stop that, (mumbles).

1:09:55.225 --> 1:09:56.858
They don't want
to live in a stew.

1:09:56.860 --> 1:09:58.593
This cove is no open dump.

1:09:58.595 --> 1:10:01.663
They are up to their gill, gill,

1:10:01.665 --> 1:10:03.898
you'll be in the guillotine
if you don't agree.

1:10:03.900 --> 1:10:05.333
- You hear this?

1:10:05.335 --> 1:10:06.467
Get the kid out of here.

1:10:06.469 --> 1:10:08.419
- Stop.

1:10:08.420 --> 1:10:10.370
The herrings die, the
sea dies, the world dies

1:10:10.373 --> 1:10:12.307
and Simon moves away.

1:10:12.309 --> 1:10:13.374
- Crank the shank.

1:10:13.376 --> 1:10:14.776
Crank the shank.

1:10:15.912 --> 1:10:18.413
- Hey, what's in the bottle?

1:10:18.415 --> 1:10:19.447
(playful music)

1:10:19.449 --> 1:10:21.482
Hey kid, hey kid, come back.

1:10:21.484 --> 1:10:23.651
(grunts) Why does
this always happen?

1:10:23.653 --> 1:10:25.887
(screams)

1:10:34.931 --> 1:10:37.232
(splash)

1:10:39.269 --> 1:10:40.535
(herrings chatter)

1:10:40.537 --> 1:10:41.803
- They will catch
you in their net

1:10:41.805 --> 1:10:43.905
and make you into
soup and fish tacos.

1:10:43.907 --> 1:10:46.841
- Oh no, tell them we'll
surrender, we'll surrender.

1:10:46.843 --> 1:10:48.743
- No time, the net is coming.

1:10:48.745 --> 1:10:49.777
Help us super fur ball.

1:10:49.779 --> 1:10:51.412
We don't want to
end up in a soup

1:10:51.414 --> 1:10:52.914
or a casserole.

1:10:52.916 --> 1:10:53.881
Help, help!

1:10:54.684 --> 1:10:56.050
- Here we go.

1:10:56.052 --> 1:10:57.752
Crank, crank, crank.

1:10:59.256 --> 1:11:01.556
(boat creaks)

1:11:05.562 --> 1:11:08.363
(herrings scream)

1:11:08.365 --> 1:11:10.932
(Emilia grunts)

1:11:12.435 --> 1:11:14.836
(boat creaks)

1:11:26.650 --> 1:11:28.383
(boat horn blares)

1:11:28.385 --> 1:11:30.952
(captain gasps)

1:11:48.672 --> 1:11:51.539
(uplifting music)

1:12:14.931 --> 1:12:17.732
(herrings cheer)

1:12:28.511 --> 1:12:32.480
- Uh, so, I guess the
power cable could be, uh.

1:12:36.152 --> 1:12:39.554
- Yeah, I guess we
could fix it now, right?

1:12:39.556 --> 1:12:40.788
- I could do it.

1:12:42.058 --> 1:12:45.126
- All right, get
down there already.

1:12:49.766 --> 1:12:52.133
The power shortage
was caused by toxins

1:12:52.135 --> 1:12:55.036
seeping into the water,
corroding the cable.

1:12:55.038 --> 1:12:57.638
It's a serious
environmental crime.

1:12:57.640 --> 1:13:00.575
- I can't comment on the
pending charges at this point.

1:13:00.577 --> 1:13:04.445
We are cooperating
with investigators

1:13:04.447 --> 1:13:08.649
but environmental industries
are very dear to me, as well.

1:13:08.651 --> 1:13:10.385
For future generations.

1:13:10.387 --> 1:13:12.620
I have a family and a child.

1:13:14.657 --> 1:13:16.624
(ding)

1:13:16.626 --> 1:13:20.061
- The power is back in and the
citizens can sigh in relief.

1:13:20.063 --> 1:13:22.563
But the fish population
has weakened.

1:13:22.565 --> 1:13:24.932
Herrings have
disappeared all together.

1:13:24.934 --> 1:13:27.568
The state fishery says the
situation will return to normal

1:13:27.570 --> 1:13:28.636
with time.

1:13:30.573 --> 1:13:32.407
- Why are you still growling?

1:13:32.409 --> 1:13:35.810
Didn't I do what you
guys wanted me to do?

1:13:42.085 --> 1:13:42.817
Simon!

1:13:42.819 --> 1:13:44.018
- Hi.

1:13:44.020 --> 1:13:45.820
- So cool you didn't
have to move after all.

1:13:45.822 --> 1:13:46.721
- Yeah.

1:13:48.958 --> 1:13:53.528
That was quite a hullaballoo
at the cove last night.

1:13:54.898 --> 1:13:57.732
(old west music)

1:14:12.115 --> 1:14:15.082
- Nesting places to
many species of birds.

1:14:15.084 --> 1:14:17.618
- That's why reeds are the
vital part of the ecosystem

1:14:17.620 --> 1:14:18.686
of our water bodies.

1:14:18.688 --> 1:14:20.121
The end.

1:14:20.123 --> 1:14:21.589
(students clap)

1:14:21.591 --> 1:14:23.491
- Thank you, very nice.

1:14:23.493 --> 1:14:28.129
Next up, we have Simon and
the islands on the Baltic Sea.

1:14:30.767 --> 1:14:33.668
(Greasy laughs)

1:14:37.574 --> 1:14:40.208
(students laugh)

1:14:41.678 --> 1:14:44.479
(students laugh)

1:14:50.119 --> 1:14:52.119
(playful music)

1:14:52.121 --> 1:14:54.622
- [Giant Guinea Pig] If you're
good as plain old Emilia,

1:14:54.624 --> 1:14:57.725
you're good as super fur ball.

1:14:57.727 --> 1:15:00.561
(uplifting music)

1:15:21.251 --> 1:15:23.084
- [Teacher] Emilia,
what are you doing?

1:15:23.086 --> 1:15:24.619
- We did our projects together.

1:15:24.621 --> 1:15:26.287
I helped Simon and
Simon helped me.

1:15:26.289 --> 1:15:27.822
- Oh look, how cute.

1:15:27.824 --> 1:15:29.790
- Sh, we're in the middle
of our presentation.

1:15:29.792 --> 1:15:32.026
- Sh, who do you
think you're shushing?

1:15:32.028 --> 1:15:34.795
- You, shut up Greasy Antero.

1:15:34.797 --> 1:15:36.964
- Are you pals with him?

1:15:36.966 --> 1:15:40.601
- No, not a pal, a
friend, a best friend.

1:15:42.572 --> 1:15:45.706
Well then, islands,
by Simon and Emilia.

1:15:45.708 --> 1:15:47.875
- Aw, look at these love birds.

1:15:47.877 --> 1:15:48.910
So cute.

1:15:48.912 --> 1:15:50.811
- Sh, will you be quiet?

1:15:50.813 --> 1:15:53.581
I want to hear what Emilia
and Simon have to say.

1:15:53.583 --> 1:15:56.817
- Antero, be nice, just like
you were on TV last night.

1:15:56.819 --> 1:16:00.054
(students laugh)

1:16:00.056 --> 1:16:00.955
- Simon.

1:16:09.632 --> 1:16:11.232
- I was going to pack it in

1:16:11.234 --> 1:16:14.735
but then I thought, weed
based food will soon catch on.

1:16:14.737 --> 1:16:16.320
(laughs)

1:16:16.321 --> 1:16:17.904
Oh, as an appetizer, I
recommend frog spawn.

1:16:17.907 --> 1:16:19.807
It's protein for
the whole family.

1:16:19.809 --> 1:16:20.808
Three dollars only.

1:16:20.810 --> 1:16:22.243
Enjoy.

1:16:22.245 --> 1:16:24.278
Oh, hey Emilia.

1:16:24.280 --> 1:16:25.846
And here you go.

1:16:33.656 --> 1:16:34.388
- Tada!

1:16:35.858 --> 1:16:38.759
(uplifting music)

1:16:41.197 --> 1:16:44.265
This should be clean
by next spring.

1:16:49.372 --> 1:16:50.371
- Hi Emilia.

1:16:50.373 --> 1:16:52.206
- Hi Antero.

1:16:52.208 --> 1:16:55.743
- This is going to be
wonderful, super fur ball.

1:16:55.745 --> 1:16:56.811
Thank you.

1:16:59.015 --> 1:17:01.849
And thank you for
this temporary home.

1:17:01.851 --> 1:17:03.918
Love how the scenery opens up.

1:17:03.920 --> 1:17:06.687
Where did you put
the rest of my gang?

1:17:06.689 --> 1:17:08.990
- Well, I had help
from my friends.

1:17:08.992 --> 1:17:11.892
(uplifting music)

1:17:42.258 --> 1:17:43.858
(playful music)

1:17:43.860 --> 1:17:44.759
- Thanks.

1:17:47.730 --> 1:17:50.665
(ball thunders)

1:17:50.667 --> 1:17:51.732
- Run Simon!

1:17:57.740 --> 1:17:59.874
- Can't be bothered.

1:17:59.876 --> 1:18:01.375
This is not my thing.

1:18:01.377 --> 1:18:04.178
(everyone claps)

1:18:11.287 --> 1:18:12.286
(smooth music)

1:18:12.288 --> 1:18:16.190
(singing in foreign language)
