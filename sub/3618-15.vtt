WEBVTT

00:04.478 --> 00:06.738
- Here you go, thanks for coming.
- Thanks.

00:06.838 --> 00:10.318
Thanks for inviting us,
it was a fun party.

00:10.638 --> 00:13.057
Oh, I still can't believe
that Wyatt is 1 already.

00:13.157 --> 00:15.897
Oh, I know. You can't.

00:15.997 --> 00:18.997
- Nice to finally meet you, Leo.
- Yeah, you too.

00:19.317 --> 00:20.897
Frank and some of the other dads

00:20.997 --> 00:23.197
get the kids together on Saturdays,
if you're interested.

00:24.876 --> 00:26.996
- Yeah, thanks.
- Excellent.

00:27.556 --> 00:29.176
- Thank you.
- Bye.

00:29.276 --> 00:31.276
- I'll call you.
- Okay, great.

00:38.555 --> 00:40.375
I am exhausted.

00:40.475 --> 00:41.935
Did you have fun?

00:42.035 --> 00:45.275
- Did you like it?
- Yeah, he was a really good boy

00:45.635 --> 00:47.834
and only made
Mommy freeze the room once.

00:48.554 --> 00:50.814
He was excited, it's his birthday.

00:50.914 --> 00:53.674
He was excited to see you.
He misses you.

00:54.674 --> 00:57.314
I know. I miss him too.

00:58.593 --> 01:00.673
Hey, you guys want
any more champagne?

01:02.233 --> 01:04.613
Come on, we don't want it
to go to waste.

01:04.712 --> 01:07.633
- How about it, Dad?
- Elders aren't allowed to drink.

01:07.953 --> 01:11.352
Oh, come on, when on Earth,
you should do as earthlings do.

01:11.672 --> 01:14.792
- Sorry.
- Not that I'm complaining or anything,

01:15.112 --> 01:17.192
because you guys
did such great work,

01:17.512 --> 01:21.551
but champagne, chocolate-covered
strawberries, oysters?

01:21.871 --> 01:24.031
Aren't the kids a little young
for the aphrodisiacs?

01:24.351 --> 01:26.371
They're aphrodisiacs?

01:26.471 --> 01:28.451
Who knew?

01:28.551 --> 01:30.011
Bubbly?

01:30.111 --> 01:31.691
- Paige?
- What?

01:31.791 --> 01:33.850
Come on, there were
milk and cookies here too.

01:33.950 --> 01:39.270
You know, maybe if there were
more kids living in this house

01:39.670 --> 01:43.190
I would know what to get.
Did you ever stop to think about that?

01:43.510 --> 01:45.509
Excuse me.

01:47.469 --> 01:50.829
She's been weird
since she changed her hair colour.

01:51.149 --> 01:53.229
She'll probably change it back.

01:53.549 --> 01:56.128
Okay, forget about the strawberries,
she's on to us.

01:56.228 --> 01:58.448
What do you mean?
She knows about Chris?

01:58.548 --> 02:01.768
No, she knows we're up
to something.

02:01.868 --> 02:04.548
I can't believe how hard it is
to get two people laid.

02:04.868 --> 02:06.907
Paige, that is disgusting.

02:07.227 --> 02:09.426
Well, it's what
we're trying to do, right?

02:09.747 --> 02:12.687
No, we are trying to romance
Piper and Leo together

02:12.787 --> 02:15.407
so they can conceive Chris,
our nephew.

02:15.507 --> 02:16.967
And that's different how?

02:17.067 --> 02:20.066
<i>Well, because what you said is very</i>
<i>Springer, what I said is very Oprah.</i>

02:21.706 --> 02:25.946
Well, whatever show we're watching,
we're running out of time.

02:26.746 --> 02:28.786
At least Chris is.
We should probably tell him.

02:29.106 --> 02:31.305
Yes. Chris.

02:34.065 --> 02:36.565
Hey. So how's it going?

02:36.665 --> 02:39.225
- Not so good.
- Well, what do you mean?

02:39.545 --> 02:41.824
- What does she mean?
- We're running out of ideas.

02:42.144 --> 02:45.104
Well, that's too bad, because it has
to happen today or I don't happen.

02:45.464 --> 02:48.084
- Wait, today?
- Yeah, I did the math.

02:48.184 --> 02:50.944
And if I'm not conceived
by midnight tonight, that's it.

02:51.264 --> 02:54.403
I won't be born. Which means
I won't be coming back from the future

02:54.503 --> 02:58.343
- to warn you about Wyatt turning evil.
- Yeah, see, that time-travel thing...

02:58.663 --> 03:01.503
What about making a love potion
and just, like, slipping it to them?

03:01.863 --> 03:04.482
No, we're not tricking your parents.

03:04.582 --> 03:06.482
Why not? I'm desperate.

03:06.582 --> 03:08.662
Hey, look, I have an idea.

03:08.982 --> 03:11.622
Call me crazy, but why don't
we just tell them the truth?

03:12.502 --> 03:16.181
Sure, let's give them a massive case
of performance anxiety.

03:16.581 --> 03:18.941
- We're running out of options.
- And time.

03:25.581 --> 03:27.580
Wyatt!

03:42.819 --> 03:44.819
Arrow!

03:47.979 --> 03:50.298
I got you. I got you, I got you.

03:53.938 --> 03:56.538
You're okay. You're okay.

03:57.978 --> 04:00.398
Thanks for saving my life.

04:00.498 --> 04:02.497
Hope it wasn't for nothing.

05:54.648 --> 05:57.387
- Is that enough to scry with?
- Only one way to find out.

05:57.487 --> 06:00.807
At least he waited till after the party
to attack, that was nice of him.

06:01.607 --> 06:04.407
What I don't understand is,
why would the darklighter attack at all?

06:04.727 --> 06:07.167
I mean, with all of us here
at the same time, it's suicide.

06:07.486 --> 06:11.126
All the more reason to find him
and stop him before he tries again.

06:11.886 --> 06:14.766
I don't think he was after a
whitelighter, I think he was after me.

06:16.166 --> 06:17.266
Or Wyatt.

06:17.366 --> 06:19.465
Well, then why don't you
take Piper up there

06:19.565 --> 06:21.745
- and take Wyatt too?
- Yeah, I'll go with you.

06:21.845 --> 06:24.205
But you're not allowed.

06:25.485 --> 06:27.905
All right, so then we'll go
to the magic school.

06:28.005 --> 06:30.245
You'll be safe there.
You can't be hurt, right?

06:30.564 --> 06:32.724
That's great. One big happy family.

06:33.844 --> 06:35.844
You change him, I'll pack him.

06:37.204 --> 06:39.204
Come on.

06:40.004 --> 06:41.584
Think now is a good time
to tell them?

06:41.684 --> 06:44.043
No. The sooner we take care
of the darklighter,

06:44.363 --> 06:46.543
the sooner we make you.

06:46.643 --> 06:50.803
- I'm gonna start scrying.
- And I will go start the love potion.

06:51.203 --> 06:53.722
Wait. I thought you were
against making the love potion.

06:54.042 --> 06:56.882
Not if it's gonna save one of
my two favourite nephews.

07:14.281 --> 07:17.000
- Nice play, my friend.
- It worked, didn't it?

07:17.320 --> 07:20.180
Not yet it hasn't.
Not until the witches come after you.

07:20.280 --> 07:22.060
They'll come.

07:22.160 --> 07:24.880
- They always do.
- But will the Elder?

07:25.200 --> 07:28.559
I mean, now that he knows you're after
him, won't he think it's too dangerous?

07:28.919 --> 07:31.099
Not this Elder.

07:31.199 --> 07:33.199
He's blinded by fatherhood...

07:33.839 --> 07:36.199
...by his unwavering desire
to protect his son.

07:36.519 --> 07:39.039
He can't be sure I'm not
after the boy too.

07:40.718 --> 07:42.718
He'll come.

07:44.038 --> 07:45.978
But...

07:46.078 --> 07:48.318
...he won't be immune
to the poison.

07:49.318 --> 07:52.797
- I'll need a dozen more for later.
- They're being forged as we speak.

07:54.957 --> 07:57.137
You're all right to go through
with this, Damien?

07:57.237 --> 08:00.517
A deal was struck, I was chosen.

08:01.077 --> 08:04.596
Besides, he deserves to get
what he paid for, doesn't he?

08:04.916 --> 08:06.916
Leo out of the way.

08:08.436 --> 08:11.196
Just make sure the code's
properly prepared.

08:12.036 --> 08:14.315
We only get one shot at this.

08:15.715 --> 08:17.835
All right, arm up.

08:18.155 --> 08:22.115
But remember, we're only supposed
to distract the witches, not harm them.

08:22.475 --> 08:24.475
They're not the target this time...

08:25.274 --> 08:27.274
...the Elder is.

08:36.832 --> 08:40.352
These aren't just books, Sara,
they're legacies.

08:42.113 --> 08:46.593
Handed down over the ages
by other magical beings.

08:46.953 --> 08:49.392
And worthy of your great care.

08:53.472 --> 08:55.612
- Understand?
- Yes, sir.

08:55.712 --> 08:57.092
- Good.
- Gideon.

08:57.192 --> 08:59.172
Leo. What a pleasant surprise.

08:59.272 --> 09:01.651
- How are you, my boy?
- I've been better.

09:01.751 --> 09:04.431
A darklighter attacked,
I think he's after me.

09:07.991 --> 09:09.611
- Are you certain?
- I don't know.

09:09.711 --> 09:12.390
He may be trying to get me
out of the way to get to Wyatt.

09:12.790 --> 09:15.690
I dropped Piper and Wyatt off at
the nursery. I hope that's all right.

09:15.790 --> 09:17.130
Of course. Absolutely.

09:17.230 --> 09:19.670
I better get back to Phoebe and Paige,
see if I can help.

09:19.990 --> 09:21.090
No, you shouldn't.

09:21.190 --> 09:23.709
You should go up with the other
Elders, where you'll be safe.

09:24.509 --> 09:27.029
- What about the darklighter?
- It's not your responsibility.

09:27.349 --> 09:30.129
That's for the sisters to handle.
It's what they do.

09:30.229 --> 09:31.729
Well, I can't just sit around

09:31.829 --> 09:33.848
while someone is after my son.
I'm a father now.

09:33.948 --> 09:37.208
No, you're an Elder now,
and it's time to start acting like one.

09:37.308 --> 09:39.088
Don't you see?

09:39.188 --> 09:41.808
You don't just put yourself at risk
by staying here on Earth,

09:41.908 --> 09:43.688
you put all Elders at risk too.

09:43.788 --> 09:46.047
If they get you,
they get access to us all.

09:46.147 --> 09:48.587
- I know, but...
- You can't justify staying here

09:48.907 --> 09:52.067
any longer, not with this,
not anymore.

09:52.667 --> 09:54.667
It's time to fully accept
your calling...

09:55.307 --> 09:58.286
...one that necessarily transcends
the sins of the flesh,

09:58.386 --> 10:00.626
family, even fatherhood.

10:00.946 --> 10:06.306
One that requires you to cut the ties
that bind for everyone's sake.

10:08.465 --> 10:10.465
I can't.

10:11.465 --> 10:14.025
At least not until I know
my son is safe. I'm sorry.

10:29.984 --> 10:31.983
What are you still doing here?

10:32.583 --> 10:35.483
Thought you'd be out and about
by now.

10:35.583 --> 10:37.723
Clarence, hey.

10:37.823 --> 10:40.623
- Didn't hear you come up.
- You mind?

10:42.782 --> 10:44.922
Please, go ahead.

10:45.022 --> 10:47.122
Beautiful day outside, isn't it?

10:47.222 --> 10:50.902
Is it? I haven't really noticed.
I've been too busy...

10:51.502 --> 10:53.002
...rechecking something.

10:53.102 --> 10:55.541
Whole world seems to be
too busy nowadays.

10:55.861 --> 10:59.821
Nobody's got time to just
enjoy their day anymore.

11:00.181 --> 11:02.681
Well, it doesn't get any better
in the future either.

11:02.781 --> 11:04.601
I mean...

11:04.701 --> 11:07.780
- I'd imagine.
- Future don't mean squat to me.

11:08.100 --> 11:10.040
I'm too old to worry about it.

11:10.140 --> 11:13.180
Shouldn't to you either.
You're too young.

11:14.700 --> 11:16.700
Well, unfortunately...

11:17.899 --> 11:20.379
...I'm kind of obsessed with it.

11:21.459 --> 11:24.579
- You all right?
- Yeah.

11:25.219 --> 11:26.919
Yeah, I just...

11:27.019 --> 11:28.638
I just probably need to eat.

11:28.738 --> 11:31.018
What you need is to get out
of this hole.

11:31.778 --> 11:35.098
Get some sun. Live a little.

11:35.418 --> 11:37.558
Believe me...

11:37.658 --> 11:39.658
...I'm trying.

11:40.177 --> 11:42.177
Do that.

11:57.696 --> 11:59.836
I thought you were making
a love potion.

11:59.936 --> 12:02.676
- I am.
- Then why did it blow up?

12:02.776 --> 12:06.135
- Maybe I'm trying too hard?
- Or maybe it just wasn't meant to be.

12:06.455 --> 12:08.715
- Phoebe!
- Come on, you weren't thinking

12:08.815 --> 12:11.115
- the exact same thing?
- No.

12:11.215 --> 12:14.774
Okay, fine. But for, like, a second.
The point is, Chris is meant to be.

12:15.094 --> 12:17.554
But not if he changed too much
by coming here.

12:17.654 --> 12:19.634
You know, messed up
his own time line.

12:19.734 --> 12:21.894
We're talking about
his very existence.

12:22.214 --> 12:24.774
Paige, I know, but there's only
so much we can do.

12:25.094 --> 12:27.853
Especially now,
with that darklighter out there.

12:28.333 --> 12:32.133
I just think that we have to face
the reality that Chris' destiny

12:32.453 --> 12:35.153
might have been just to come here
and warn us about Wyatt,

12:35.253 --> 12:37.253
and that's all.

12:38.812 --> 12:40.912
Hey.

12:41.012 --> 12:43.012
Oh, my God, Chris, I'm so sorry.

12:43.532 --> 12:46.572
No, it's okay. I've actually
been wondering the same thing.

12:47.692 --> 12:49.871
You have?

12:49.971 --> 12:51.351
Yeah.

12:51.451 --> 12:54.411
I kind of have
the strangest feeling, like...

12:55.491 --> 12:58.871
I don't know, it's really hard to explain,
but it feels like I'm...

12:58.971 --> 13:02.330
I'm floating.
Like I'm not really here, you know?

13:02.690 --> 13:04.470
That doesn't sound good.

13:04.570 --> 13:06.570
Well, you have to fight it.
We still have time.

13:06.970 --> 13:08.970
Not much.

13:11.490 --> 13:14.289
I've never seen it do that before.

13:15.409 --> 13:17.929
Maybe that means
there's more than one?

13:18.889 --> 13:20.889
I'll go get Piper.

13:22.249 --> 13:24.968
- I'll go too.
- No, you stay here.

13:25.288 --> 13:26.708
Okay, finish the potion.

13:26.808 --> 13:28.968
When we come back,
your parents will be in the mood.

13:29.728 --> 13:31.728
Okay.

13:46.886 --> 13:49.746
- Are you sure this is the place?
- Yeah, down that alley.

13:49.846 --> 13:51.826
Thank God we didn't orb in.

13:51.926 --> 13:53.866
We couldn't, they'd have known
we were coming.

13:53.966 --> 13:55.706
Well, maybe they know already.

13:55.806 --> 13:57.466
- What do you mean?
- I mean,

13:57.566 --> 14:00.225
since when do darklighters hang out
in broad daylight like this?

14:00.325 --> 14:02.325
It could be a trap.
Maybe you should stay here.

14:03.045 --> 14:04.745
No, I'm the bait, remember?

14:04.845 --> 14:07.825
Besides, if it is a trap, you might
need me to help you orb back.

14:07.925 --> 14:11.764
Well, I got Phoebe, you get Piper out
of here for Chris'... For Wyatt's sake.

14:12.084 --> 14:14.364
Let's just do this.

14:23.323 --> 14:25.323
I don't see anything.

14:30.243 --> 14:32.242
You take Piper.

14:38.042 --> 14:40.042
Phoebe, watch out!

14:48.561 --> 14:50.561
Behind you!

14:55.800 --> 14:57.800
Piper!

15:01.440 --> 15:02.820
Phoebe.

15:02.920 --> 15:05.100
- Oh, my God, you're bleeding.
- Yeah.

15:05.200 --> 15:06.979
Maybe we should get me
to the hospital.

15:07.079 --> 15:09.519
Yeah. I got you.

15:30.557 --> 15:32.557
Hey! Hey!

15:39.197 --> 15:41.196
Phoebe? Paige?

15:41.676 --> 15:43.656
Where's my car?

15:43.756 --> 15:46.096
What's going on?
Where did everybody go?

15:46.196 --> 15:48.196
That's a good question.

15:48.876 --> 15:50.456
Well, they've gotta be here
somewhere.

15:50.556 --> 15:53.515
- I think we should get out of here.
- No, not without Phoebe. She's hurt.

15:53.835 --> 15:56.215
- Didn't you see her fall?
- But at least she's alive.

15:56.315 --> 15:57.935
- What does that mean?
- I don't know,

15:58.035 --> 16:00.755
but I think we need to get off the street
while we figure this out.

16:01.715 --> 16:03.535
The hospital.
If Paige couldn't get to you,

16:03.635 --> 16:06.074
she'd take Phoebe to the hospital.
Memorial's down the street.

16:06.434 --> 16:07.774
Piper, you don't understand.

16:07.874 --> 16:10.714
We can't worry about them right now.
We need to worry about us.

16:12.314 --> 16:14.314
- Leo.
- Piper.

16:15.353 --> 16:16.933
You're not supposed to be here.

16:17.033 --> 16:19.613
Yeah, well, you're not supposed
to be here either.

16:19.713 --> 16:21.713
At least not in one piece.

16:23.953 --> 16:25.953
Come on.

16:26.433 --> 16:29.672
- What's wrong with your powers?
- I don't know. Run.

16:30.032 --> 16:32.032
Go, go, go!

16:34.312 --> 16:37.172
You can run, but you can't hide.

16:37.272 --> 16:39.711
You're in my world now!

16:45.711 --> 16:48.211
What part of "don't hurt the witches"
didn't you understand?

16:48.311 --> 16:51.150
What was I supposed to do?
They'd already killed three of us.

16:51.470 --> 16:55.190
So what? You're expendable.
We all are for this.

16:56.550 --> 16:58.130
It's bad enough one's wounded now,

16:58.230 --> 17:00.570
but none of them were supposed
to end up there.

17:00.670 --> 17:02.049
None of them!

17:02.149 --> 17:04.888
We were only meant to separate
the Elder from his protectors.

17:04.989 --> 17:08.029
To make the witches fear he died
so they wouldn't try to look for him.

17:08.388 --> 17:11.589
Still, just because she's with him
doesn't mean she can protect him.

17:11.909 --> 17:13.608
No one has powers
in the ghostly plane.

17:13.708 --> 17:15.448
That's why Damien wanted him
sent there.

17:15.548 --> 17:17.667
But that's not the point, now, is it?

17:18.228 --> 17:20.728
Damien may be forced
to kill her now too.

17:20.828 --> 17:23.627
And that was specifically
not what he was hired to do.

17:25.787 --> 17:27.686
Worse, the other witches
may be less inclined

17:27.787 --> 17:30.407
to accept the death of a sister
than of a brother-in-law,

17:30.507 --> 17:32.167
especially with their history.

17:32.267 --> 17:35.906
All the more reason for us
to keep them distracted...

17:36.466 --> 17:38.546
...at all costs now.

17:46.426 --> 17:49.525
No broken bones,
no internal bleeding.

17:49.625 --> 17:52.425
Other than a mild concussion,
I'd say you're a very lucky woman.

17:52.745 --> 17:54.565
Great. Does that mean
I can go home now?

17:54.665 --> 17:57.785
No. Actually, I think I'd like to keep
you here overnight for observation.

17:58.105 --> 18:00.004
Oh, no, that's not possible.

18:00.104 --> 18:03.144
Miss Halliwell, I don't have
to remind you, you took quite a fall.

18:03.464 --> 18:05.964
It's possible you might have more
than just a concussion.

18:06.064 --> 18:08.344
And sometimes other symptoms
don't develop for 24 hours.

18:08.664 --> 18:11.623
Yeah, well, I don't have 24 hours.
I gotta go. Gotta go.

18:13.423 --> 18:15.543
- You'll have to sign a release.
- That's fine.

18:16.063 --> 18:18.383
If you feel any dizziness
or light-headedness, call me.

18:18.703 --> 18:21.123
Otherwise, I'll see you in a week
to remove the stitches.

18:21.223 --> 18:23.222
Thanks.

18:25.502 --> 18:27.442
- All right, come on.
- This way.

18:27.542 --> 18:30.822
- Let's go. Get him in three.
- All right, got it.

18:34.061 --> 18:36.341
Hey. What did he say?
Are you all right?

18:36.661 --> 18:39.301
Yeah. Well, he's releasing me,
isn't he?

18:41.141 --> 18:44.700
Okay, don't worry about this, Paige.
We're gonna figure something out.

18:45.180 --> 18:47.080
Okay, but what about Chris?

18:47.180 --> 18:50.040
- What about Chris?
- What if he doesn't exist anymore

18:50.140 --> 18:52.420
because his mom and dad
don't exist anymore?

18:52.740 --> 18:54.960
No, if Piper were gone,

18:55.060 --> 18:58.019
I would sense it. I know it.

19:04.339 --> 19:07.738
- Oh, my God, what happened?
- A truck hit a bus.

19:18.977 --> 19:22.937
- Phoebe? Paige?
- They're not here, I'm telling you.

19:23.297 --> 19:26.737
- They have to be here. Phoebe's hurt.
- Not in this plane she's not.

19:27.417 --> 19:29.437
The blast, when you blew up
the darklighter,

19:29.537 --> 19:31.556
it must have knocked us
into this other place.

19:31.656 --> 19:34.336
One that coexists with our world,
but not with our lives.

19:34.656 --> 19:36.276
What are you talking about?
What world?

19:36.376 --> 19:37.836
I don't know.

19:37.936 --> 19:41.076
I don't think we're here by accident.
I think it's the darklighter's plan,

19:41.176 --> 19:44.615
to have us here without our powers
and without your sisters.

19:45.535 --> 19:47.355
Phoebe?

19:47.455 --> 19:48.755
- Excuse us.
- Coming though.

19:48.855 --> 19:50.875
<i>Phoebe?</i>

19:50.975 --> 19:52.795
- What?
- Do you hear something?

19:52.895 --> 19:54.394
Hear what?

19:54.494 --> 19:56.614
I could have sworn I heard someone
call out my name.

19:56.934 --> 19:58.994
BP's dropping. We're losing him.

19:59.094 --> 20:01.614
Two hundred fifty cc's of lido.
He's flatlining.

20:02.574 --> 20:06.373
Come on, come on.
Did anyone call the driver's family?

20:06.733 --> 20:09.413
- We still got no pulse. Paddles.
- Paddles.

20:10.973 --> 20:13.153
- Two hundred joules.
- Charging.

20:13.253 --> 20:15.253
Clear.

20:17.892 --> 20:19.912
Piper, we gotta keep moving.
We can't stay here.

20:20.012 --> 20:23.532
Damn it, Piper,
I don't want you to get hurt too.

20:24.252 --> 20:26.252
Okay.

20:33.211 --> 20:34.831
Am I dead?

20:34.931 --> 20:37.171
Leo, what's going on?

20:37.491 --> 20:39.490
Leo.

20:40.530 --> 20:42.530
Are you an angel?

20:50.610 --> 20:52.809
I know what plane we're on.

20:53.489 --> 20:55.609
The ghostly plane.

20:58.969 --> 21:00.469
He's back.

21:00.569 --> 21:02.568
He's stabilizing.

21:04.448 --> 21:07.608
Sir, do you know where you are?

21:08.288 --> 21:10.348
- Do you know your name?
- Let's go.

21:10.448 --> 21:12.148
Leo.

21:12.248 --> 21:14.507
Leo.

21:14.607 --> 21:17.487
- You must be an angel.
- Leo?

21:19.047 --> 21:21.367
What? What's wrong?

21:22.007 --> 21:24.007
Piper.

21:38.925 --> 21:40.925
Come on.

21:52.804 --> 21:56.184
I'm telling you, I felt Piper, as if
she were standing right next to me.

21:56.284 --> 21:57.784
- But she wasn't.
- I know.

21:57.884 --> 22:01.163
- I'm still trying to figure that part out.
- Phoebe, Paige.

22:03.403 --> 22:04.783
Chris, you're okay.

22:04.883 --> 22:06.383
Which means Piper and Leo
are okay.

22:06.483 --> 22:08.883
Well, I don't know about them,
but I'm...

22:09.443 --> 22:12.122
I'm definitely running out
of time here.

22:24.441 --> 22:26.541
- What?
- I don't know what else to try.

22:26.641 --> 22:28.301
- What do you mean?
- What do I mean?

22:28.401 --> 22:29.901
There's nothing else to try.

22:30.001 --> 22:33.281
Oh, great. Why don't you try telling that
to Chris as he fades away.

22:33.641 --> 22:35.500
No, I can't.

22:35.600 --> 22:38.740
Right. Well, here's the deal.
You felt Piper.

22:38.840 --> 22:41.260
That means she's gotta be
out there somewhere.

22:41.360 --> 22:43.340
And if we can figure out where,

22:43.440 --> 22:46.039
then maybe we can figure out
how to bring them back.

22:46.879 --> 22:48.879
You said we weren't gonna lose her.

22:49.239 --> 22:52.159
- The bus driver.
- The bus driver what?

22:52.479 --> 22:55.139
Well, he was dead.
I mean, at least for a little bit.

22:55.239 --> 22:56.738
So maybe that wasn't a coincidence.

22:56.838 --> 22:59.398
Maybe he actually did see Leo,
in limbo.

22:59.758 --> 23:01.818
That's good.

23:01.918 --> 23:05.018
No, that's bad, because that would
make them dead.

23:05.118 --> 23:08.357
Not if someone put them there,
like the darklighter.

23:08.717 --> 23:11.737
- The one Piper vanquished?
- Unless it wasn't really a vanquish.

23:11.837 --> 23:14.057
It was just made to look like
a vanquish.

23:14.157 --> 23:17.157
Okay, ghost. Ghost, ghost, ghost...

23:25.876 --> 23:27.876
Sorry.

23:30.036 --> 23:32.255
Good thing you're immune
to the poison.

23:32.355 --> 23:34.355
Yeah, too bad you're not.

23:34.835 --> 23:36.835
My, my.

23:37.195 --> 23:38.855
Impressed?

23:38.955 --> 23:40.955
Very.

23:47.074 --> 23:50.794
- That should stop the bleeding.
- Thanks.

23:52.234 --> 23:56.953
You know, I rather imagined meadows,
waterfalls, maybe even a harp.

23:58.793 --> 24:01.413
Well, this isn't the afterlife.

24:01.513 --> 24:03.373
It's...

24:03.473 --> 24:06.112
...a place before that,
to ease the transition.

24:06.872 --> 24:09.012
And lucky us, we're stuck here.

24:09.112 --> 24:13.472
That is, until our friendly darklighter
helps us move on permanently.

24:13.832 --> 24:15.492
No, we're not gonna let that happen.

24:15.592 --> 24:17.771
We've been through a lot more
than this.

24:17.871 --> 24:19.691
- Have we?
- Are you kidding?

24:19.791 --> 24:22.231
Ever since we met,
it's been one ordeal after the other.

24:22.751 --> 24:26.271
Wow, you make it sound so romantic.

24:27.191 --> 24:30.110
That's not what I meant.
I mean, look at...

24:30.590 --> 24:32.590
...everything we've been through...

24:32.990 --> 24:34.990
...everything we've overcome.

24:35.590 --> 24:37.590
This is just one more thing.

24:38.750 --> 24:41.029
This isn't where it ends.

24:41.349 --> 24:43.349
I promise.

24:44.429 --> 24:46.649
All right, so how
do we get out of here?

24:46.749 --> 24:51.189
I don't know. I gotta figure the
darklighter has a way, maybe a portal.

24:51.588 --> 24:54.468
- Masked by the explosion?
- Maybe.

24:54.788 --> 24:56.648
Although somebody's gotta be
helping him

24:56.748 --> 24:58.968
with a hell of a lot more powers
than a darklighter.

24:59.068 --> 25:01.228
Do you think the portal's still there?

25:01.948 --> 25:05.787
Probably. The question is, how do
we access it without our powers?

25:06.547 --> 25:08.547
We make Phoebe and Paige
use theirs.

25:09.867 --> 25:11.647
I'm serious.
We're on the ghostly plane,

25:11.747 --> 25:13.647
so why can't we, you know,
haunt them?

25:13.747 --> 25:15.986
Make contact
like other normal ghosts do.

25:16.306 --> 25:21.146
Because not all other ghosts do. It...

25:21.546 --> 25:23.406
It takes years to learn how
to cross over.

25:23.506 --> 25:27.905
- Besides, you need a connection.
- A bond? You mean, like sisters?

25:29.345 --> 25:31.565
Come on, I know them.
I know they're looking for us,

25:31.665 --> 25:33.245
and I know they were at the hospital.

25:33.345 --> 25:36.865
- I felt them. I can't explain exactly...
- You don't have to.

25:37.225 --> 25:40.464
Far be it for me to question the power
of three after all these years.

25:40.824 --> 25:43.544
<i>Okay, so let's go. They'll be</i>
<i>at the house, at the Book of Shadows.</i>

25:45.064 --> 25:48.224
That's probably where the darklighter
will be waiting for us. He knows us.

25:48.544 --> 25:50.543
He studied us.

26:19.581 --> 26:21.581
Not good.

26:22.221 --> 26:24.220
It's almost time, Chris.

26:25.900 --> 26:29.000
Clarence. What are you doing here?

26:29.100 --> 26:31.780
Actually, I've come for you.

26:32.900 --> 26:36.059
It's okay, son, I know.

26:40.459 --> 26:42.319
Who are you?

26:42.419 --> 26:46.059
Someone who was sent
to make this easier for you.

26:46.938 --> 26:49.738
"This"? What do you mean, "this"?

26:50.098 --> 26:52.098
I think you know.

26:55.298 --> 26:57.298
You're an angel of death.

26:57.977 --> 27:00.657
Yours is a unique situation, Chris...

27:01.657 --> 27:04.737
...one which requires special handling.

27:05.777 --> 27:08.177
That's why I wanted
to meet you early.

27:08.497 --> 27:10.676
Ss you could get to know me,

27:10.776 --> 27:12.776
trust me.

27:13.656 --> 27:15.836
There's really nothing to be afraid of.

27:15.936 --> 27:19.096
- Yeah, that's easy for you to say.
- Don't fight it, Chris.

27:20.695 --> 27:24.855
- It'll only make it more difficult for you.
- No. Forget that.

27:25.895 --> 27:28.535
All right, I still got time.
You stay away from me.

27:36.694 --> 27:38.594
You sure a sÐ¹ance is the right move?

27:38.694 --> 27:43.254
Well, if they are stuck in the spirit
realm, then they're ghosts, right?

27:43.613 --> 27:45.833
- Hopefully.
- What, now you're a pessimist?

27:45.933 --> 27:50.373
Hey, a girl's allowed to vacillate. It's
not like this is an exact science, right?

27:50.733 --> 27:53.093
Okay, the spell is done.

27:53.573 --> 27:55.112
Okay, let's do this.

27:55.212 --> 27:57.332
Sorry, I don't mean to be pushy, but...

27:58.092 --> 28:00.272
Yeah, we're working on it.
We're working on it.

28:00.372 --> 28:02.372
You don't look so good.

28:03.452 --> 28:04.592
Okay.

28:04.692 --> 28:07.511
<i>Sister spirit, we call to thee</i>

28:07.611 --> 28:10.211
<i>Cross on over, so we may see</i>

28:13.611 --> 28:15.751
Wait, that wasn't supposed to happen,
was it?

28:15.851 --> 28:17.851
I'm thinking no.

28:24.690 --> 28:26.970
Okay, now what?

28:27.610 --> 28:30.689
I don't know,
I guess we try to make contact.

28:37.729 --> 28:39.729
Chris?

28:41.288 --> 28:44.228
Not exactly who I was going for,
but I guess it'll work.

28:44.328 --> 28:46.328
What are you doing here?

28:47.168 --> 28:49.208
Ceasing to exist, I think.

28:53.447 --> 28:56.327
- What happened, where did you go?
- I just saw Piper and Leo.

28:58.967 --> 29:00.967
Where did he go?

29:01.487 --> 29:03.487
I don't know.

29:05.166 --> 29:06.906
Ask him.

29:07.006 --> 29:09.426
What are you talking about?
"Ceasing to exist"?

29:09.526 --> 29:11.866
No time to explain.
I'm a connection to your sisters,

29:11.966 --> 29:14.526
and they wanna know how
to get you guys back.

29:17.045 --> 29:18.705
They think somebody made a portal

29:18.805 --> 29:21.205
- for the darklighter to pass through.
- Somebody who?

29:22.285 --> 29:24.285
Darklighters!

29:25.565 --> 29:28.004
Chris, where are you?

29:29.364 --> 29:31.364
Not so loud.

29:47.563 --> 29:49.742
Leo.

29:49.842 --> 29:52.042
Come on. Come on.

29:59.402 --> 30:01.961
Piper's not here anymore.
I can't sense her.

30:02.521 --> 30:04.521
It's too late.

30:06.281 --> 30:08.281
And not just for Piper and Leo.

30:08.761 --> 30:10.761
Take care.

30:15.720 --> 30:17.720
Chris?

30:19.760 --> 30:22.020
But if there is a portal,
it's gotta be nearby.

30:22.120 --> 30:24.459
Leo, what are you doing?

30:24.559 --> 30:26.559
Trying to save you.

30:27.079 --> 30:30.159
You... You mean you're trying
to save us, don't you?

30:32.839 --> 30:35.079
Look, you need to sit down.

30:39.478 --> 30:42.118
Maybe since the arrow
went straight through...

30:43.478 --> 30:45.518
It'll just take longer.

30:47.317 --> 30:50.517
- They'll find a way.
- How?

30:50.837 --> 30:53.437
We never even had a chance
to tell them where to meet us.

30:53.757 --> 30:55.617
They'll figure it out.

30:55.717 --> 30:57.657
I know them.

30:57.757 --> 30:59.416
In time?

30:59.516 --> 31:01.256
Look, Piper, no matter
what happens...

31:01.356 --> 31:03.436
- No.
- Keep trying to make contact.

31:03.756 --> 31:06.236
- I don't wanna hear it.
- He's not after you, he's after me.

31:06.556 --> 31:09.956
Would you please stop trying
to save me?

31:14.795 --> 31:16.695
I'm sorry I got you into this.

31:16.795 --> 31:19.395
Yeah, just one ordeal
after another, right?

31:31.514 --> 31:33.513
I never stopped loving you.

31:53.912 --> 31:56.311
Phoebe. Paige.

31:56.951 --> 31:59.571
- Gideon, we need your help.
- What's wrong?

31:59.671 --> 32:02.631
- We think we may have lost Chris.
- What?

32:02.951 --> 32:05.831
And Piper and Leo and us too,
if we're not careful.

32:06.151 --> 32:08.130
Somebody's got a bunch
of darklighters after us.

32:08.230 --> 32:09.850
And one's got Piper and Leo
trapped.

32:09.950 --> 32:11.810
- In the ghostly plane.
- The spirit realm.

32:11.910 --> 32:13.970
- Same thing.
- Right.

32:14.070 --> 32:15.930
We made contact,
but then we lost them.

32:16.030 --> 32:18.290
And we lost Chris too.
Although we're not sure why,

32:18.390 --> 32:20.949
- because she can tell if Piper's dead.
- Yeah, and I can't.

32:21.269 --> 32:23.929
She must be still around somewhere,
we just don't know where.

32:24.029 --> 32:27.269
So we need to figure out how to use
the darklighter's portal to get them out.

32:27.589 --> 32:30.428
And if you follow all that,
you're really a very powerful Elder.

32:30.748 --> 32:33.668
But darklighters don't have the power
to make portals, let alone use them.

32:33.988 --> 32:36.028
Right, we have to figure out
who can.

32:36.628 --> 32:38.668
I warned Leo.

32:39.228 --> 32:41.428
I told him something like this
might happen.

32:42.667 --> 32:44.647
What do you need?

32:44.747 --> 32:47.947
Well, we know where to find the portal,
we just don't know how to reverse it.

33:00.906 --> 33:02.926
There.

33:03.026 --> 33:05.025
Handy.

33:07.545 --> 33:09.545
Leo?

33:12.065 --> 33:14.065
Morning.

33:14.505 --> 33:16.604
What are you doing?

33:16.704 --> 33:18.704
Just trying to sense them.

33:20.144 --> 33:22.144
Any luck?

33:25.904 --> 33:28.283
You don't look so good.

33:28.383 --> 33:30.383
I know.

33:31.583 --> 33:34.003
Listen, about last night...

33:34.103 --> 33:37.143
I don't have any regrets,
if that's where this is going.

33:38.463 --> 33:40.462
It's not.

33:40.942 --> 33:42.942
But I'm glad you said that.

33:44.662 --> 33:46.742
Because I don't either.

33:49.302 --> 33:52.461
I just want you to know that
I don't have any expectations.

33:53.661 --> 33:57.541
Because I know everything that you
went through when I became an Elder.

33:58.821 --> 34:00.821
And it just...

34:02.021 --> 34:04.220
It wouldn't be fair to put you
through that again.

34:04.740 --> 34:06.760
I'm not sure I understand.

34:06.860 --> 34:10.460
Well, neither one of us wanted me
to become an Elder.

34:12.260 --> 34:14.259
But I did anyway.

34:15.699 --> 34:19.099
I was supposed to go up there
right away, but I didn't.

34:19.739 --> 34:25.858
Because you wanted to find out
who Chris was and to protect Wyatt.

34:26.297 --> 34:29.578
Those aren't the only reasons
I didn't go up there, Piper.

34:33.257 --> 34:35.257
I was holding on to you.

34:37.817 --> 34:40.297
And because of that,
I've put you at risk,

34:40.617 --> 34:43.297
and I've put my son at risk.

34:44.857 --> 34:46.976
I can't let that happen anymore.

34:48.255 --> 34:50.255
I won't let that happen.

34:50.815 --> 34:53.775
Well, fortunately you won't have
to worry about that for much longer.

34:56.616 --> 34:58.616
I'm a little surprised, actually.

34:59.016 --> 35:01.015
I didn't really think
you'd come back here.

35:01.975 --> 35:03.975
I thought I knew you better than that.

35:04.895 --> 35:06.715
Oh, well.

35:06.815 --> 35:08.875
Let her go.

35:08.975 --> 35:10.974
You don't want her.

35:11.854 --> 35:13.794
No.

35:13.894 --> 35:17.854
But I can't pass up my opportunity,
can I? It's in my nature.

35:19.014 --> 35:20.594
Besides, I wouldn't want
a Charmed One

35:20.694 --> 35:22.693
coming after me when this is over.

35:29.373 --> 35:30.873
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

35:30.973 --> 35:34.012
Because this time,
I'll vanquish you for real.

35:36.372 --> 35:38.372
Well, it's about time.

35:39.412 --> 35:41.412
Who sent you?

35:55.371 --> 35:57.110
Yes!

35:57.210 --> 35:59.210
I'm back.

35:59.570 --> 36:01.570
Wait. What...? How is that possible?

36:02.170 --> 36:04.170
Don't ask me, ask...

36:05.650 --> 36:06.870
...them.

36:06.970 --> 36:10.009
Paige, come on, quick.
We gotta get him to Gideon.

36:28.728 --> 36:30.728
I thought I'd find you here.

36:32.567 --> 36:34.567
How are you doing?

36:35.327 --> 36:38.367
The wound is healed,
if that's what you mean.

36:39.607 --> 36:42.327
- No, it's not.
- You were right. I know that now.

36:45.246 --> 36:49.046
- I can't justify staying here any longer.
- Good.

36:50.326 --> 36:52.326
Still, it's not easy.

36:53.486 --> 36:55.585
And not just as a father.

36:55.685 --> 36:57.685
- I know.
- Do you?

36:58.925 --> 37:01.565
Does any Elder? Sometimes I wish
you wouldn't have

37:01.925 --> 37:04.405
let us break the rules, you wouldn't
have let us get married.

37:04.725 --> 37:06.104
No, you don't.

37:06.204 --> 37:10.404
Love and loss forms you, Leo.

37:10.764 --> 37:13.404
It's who you are
and who you always will be.

37:14.364 --> 37:18.723
It's a life you'll treasure,
and an experience you will share.

37:20.283 --> 37:22.063
One that helps us better appreciate

37:22.163 --> 37:25.443
those that we are entrusted
to watch over.

37:25.803 --> 37:27.803
It's not fair.

37:28.642 --> 37:31.162
Sacrifice never is.

37:34.322 --> 37:36.322
It's time.

37:51.800 --> 37:54.340
- Looking good.
- Whoa.

37:54.440 --> 37:58.760
- Wait, what are you still doing here?
- Don't worry, you're fine.

37:59.880 --> 38:02.000
I just wanted to say...

38:02.640 --> 38:04.639
...good luck.

38:05.079 --> 38:07.079
Thanks.

38:08.599 --> 38:11.799
Hey. Just out of curiosity,

38:12.159 --> 38:16.878
why did you tell me all that stuff about
living life and enjoying my day

38:17.278 --> 38:19.178
if you were coming for me
all along?

38:19.278 --> 38:22.238
Just in case I wasn't leaving with you.

38:23.198 --> 38:25.758
You've been given
a second chance, Chris.

38:27.157 --> 38:29.317
Don't waste it.

39:14.113 --> 39:15.613
Hi.

39:15.713 --> 39:17.753
- Hi.
- What's going on?

39:18.513 --> 39:20.593
Maybe you should sit down
for a second.

39:20.913 --> 39:22.653
Oh, that doesn't sound good.

39:22.753 --> 39:26.872
No, no. No, it's good. It's good.
I mean, it's... You know, it's not bad.

39:27.272 --> 39:29.712
It's a really good thing.
It's not a bad thing.

39:30.032 --> 39:32.132
I think it's a really good thing,
don't you think?

39:32.232 --> 39:35.671
Yeah. I mean, it depends,
you know.

39:37.191 --> 39:41.511
- That sounds worse.
- No, it's just complicated.

39:43.471 --> 39:47.150
Okay, so why don't you guys
just tell me what's going on.

39:48.310 --> 39:50.310
All right.

39:52.350 --> 39:54.330
Paige and I...

39:54.430 --> 39:57.829
...know what happened
between you and Leo last night.

40:01.509 --> 40:03.809
Well... Excuse me?

40:03.909 --> 40:08.469
Not because anybody told us
or anything. It's just...

40:08.829 --> 40:10.828
...because of Chris.

40:11.428 --> 40:16.028
Chris? Why...? Why would Chris
know what happened last night?

40:16.388 --> 40:19.108
Well, because he wouldn't be here
if it didn't.

40:20.388 --> 40:22.007
Yeah, see, we've known for a while.

40:22.107 --> 40:24.307
We just didn't know how to talk
to you and Leo about it.

40:24.827 --> 40:26.827
Talk to us about what?

40:27.907 --> 40:29.367
- Is this my turn?
- Yeah.

40:29.467 --> 40:31.467
Yeah.

40:32.906 --> 40:35.026
Chris is your son.

40:37.466 --> 40:39.486
Wyatt's brother.
Look, I know this is huge...

40:39.586 --> 40:43.865
No, it's... It's not huge,
because it's not possible.

40:44.225 --> 40:46.625
It's crazy, because I'm not pregnant.

40:48.225 --> 40:49.725
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

40:49.825 --> 40:51.805
No, I'm not.
I mean, how could that happen?

40:51.905 --> 40:55.744
I mean... I know how that
could happen, but it...

40:58.024 --> 40:59.924
What am I gonna do?

41:00.024 --> 41:02.384
Maybe you should talk to Leo
about it.

41:02.704 --> 41:04.364
No, I can't.

41:04.464 --> 41:07.783
- Why?
- Well, because... Because I can't.

41:11.263 --> 41:13.263
This a bad time?

41:25.942 --> 41:28.982
I'm still not quite sure
what this was all about.

41:29.302 --> 41:31.741
Why so many of my kind had to die.

41:33.101 --> 41:36.381
- Why my friend had to die.
- All in good time.

41:36.701 --> 41:40.061
We still didn't even accomplish what
you wanted. We didn't get the Elder.

41:40.621 --> 41:42.840
But in a way, you did.

41:42.940 --> 41:44.940
Leo's gone, isn't he?

41:46.620 --> 41:50.660
Perhaps not in the way I had originally
intended, but gone nonetheless.

41:51.060 --> 41:53.579
Well, wasn't he your friend too?

41:54.659 --> 41:56.039
Yes, he was.

41:56.139 --> 41:58.979
We all have to make sacrifices
for the greater good.

41:59.859 --> 42:02.379
I'm evil. What do I care
about the greater good?

42:02.699 --> 42:06.138
Leo's son is just as much a threat
to your kind as he is to mine.

42:07.498 --> 42:10.498
We made a mistake
in allowing Wyatt to be born...

42:12.138 --> 42:14.158
...in allowing such
a concentration of power

42:14.258 --> 42:16.737
to be brought into this world
in one being.

42:17.057 --> 42:22.217
But now that Leo is gone
and the Charmed Ones are unaware,

42:22.577 --> 42:25.817
I'm one step closer to being able
to correct that mistake...

42:28.016 --> 42:30.016
...for good.
