Previously on
"The Vampire Diaries"...

00:03.374 --> 00:04.797
Damon's gone!

00:04.798 --> 00:06.546
Alaric will compel away
any memories

00:06.547 --> 00:08.429
I had of Damon and me
being together.

00:08.430 --> 00:09.621
Tyler and Stefan are on board.

00:09.623 --> 00:11.824
Just take it away, please.

00:11.825 --> 00:13.805
Vampires can't get
into Mystic Falls.

00:13.806 --> 00:15.989
- They can lurk around the borders.
- Aah!

00:15.990 --> 00:17.397
No!

00:17.398 --> 00:19.399
Caroline compelled her to
forget Elena attacked her.

00:19.400 --> 00:20.533
It's not a big deal.

00:20.534 --> 00:21.801
Matt: You're from Mystic Falls?

00:21.802 --> 00:23.202
One of the founding
families actually.

00:23.203 --> 00:24.637
Any final words?

00:24.638 --> 00:25.638
[Screaming]

00:25.639 --> 00:27.139
Damon: Where the hell are we?

00:27.141 --> 00:28.241
Bonnie: 1994.

00:28.242 --> 00:29.942
We got here by magic.

00:29.943 --> 00:31.043
Magic should be able
to get us out.

00:31.044 --> 00:32.311
Look who got 27 across.

00:32.311 --> 00:34.647
- I didn't finish this.
- Well, neither did I.

00:34.648 --> 00:36.782
There's someone else here.

00:36.783 --> 00:38.421
Stefan didn't say good-bye.

00:38.422 --> 00:41.063
Damon and Bonnie died,
and he just left.

00:41.064 --> 00:42.103
Let her go.

00:45.658 --> 00:47.826
[Music playing]

00:54.900 --> 00:56.469
Ain't a parking lot, kid.

00:56.470 --> 00:58.104
Yeah? Well, I'm not
here to work.

00:58.105 --> 00:59.370
Need a few days off.

00:59.372 --> 01:01.686
And it looks like
I need a new mechanic.

01:04.543 --> 01:06.879
I said I need a few days off.

01:06.880 --> 01:08.514
Are you slow?

01:08.515 --> 01:09.648
Let me simplify.

01:09.649 --> 01:13.052
Stay... keep the job.
Leave... lose it.

01:13.053 --> 01:15.921
Ohh!

01:15.922 --> 01:18.057
How the hell are you so strong?

01:18.058 --> 01:19.758
You hired a vampire.

01:19.759 --> 01:21.560
Next time, do
a background check.

01:21.561 --> 01:24.362
Now shut up and don't move.

01:26.031 --> 01:28.734
You have no idea how long
I've wanted to do that.

01:28.735 --> 01:30.869
See, I was trying to
get a fresh start,

01:30.870 --> 01:35.941
live a normal life, normal job,
normal dick of a boss.

01:35.942 --> 01:37.309
That's you by the way.

01:37.310 --> 01:39.344
This place was supposed
to be my sanctuary,

01:39.345 --> 01:42.614
and it was until yesterday.

01:42.615 --> 01:44.048
Come with me.

01:50.789 --> 01:52.491
That's my girlfriend Ivy.

01:52.492 --> 01:54.626
Somebody killed her last night
right in front of me,

01:54.627 --> 01:56.661
so now I need to go back home...

01:56.662 --> 01:58.696
Last place on this
planet I want to be...

01:58.698 --> 02:01.132
Find him, and kill him.

02:03.301 --> 02:06.238
Like I said, I need
a few days off.

02:06.239 --> 02:08.073
You should take a few days off.

02:08.074 --> 02:10.574
Thanks, buddy.
I will.

02:10.576 --> 02:13.278
Now I need you to drive my car

02:13.279 --> 02:14.913
into the woods.

02:14.914 --> 02:18.149
You're gonna bury my girlfriend
and forget this ever happened.

02:18.150 --> 02:21.819
Oh, and when I get back,
you're giving me a raise.

02:39.459 --> 02:42.228
So I, uh, volunteer at
the hospital until, like, 2:00,

02:42.230 --> 02:44.197
and then I figure we can carpool

02:44.198 --> 02:46.667
to the party
at the swimming hole.

02:46.668 --> 02:50.871
Um, normally when you move back in,
you unpack.

02:50.872 --> 02:52.472
I'm not staying.

02:52.473 --> 02:56.209
Last night was just
a momentary moment of weakness.

02:56.210 --> 02:58.078
Momentary moment?

02:58.079 --> 03:01.481
Are you sure you don't
want to come back to school?

03:01.482 --> 03:04.718
Caroline, needing your
friends isn't a weakness,

03:04.719 --> 03:07.654
momentary or otherwise.

03:07.655 --> 03:11.958
Tell that to Stefan, who
clearly needs no one.

03:11.959 --> 03:15.395
Cut him some slack.
He lost his brother.

03:15.396 --> 03:18.565
Granted, said brother was
a soulless homicidal maniac,

03:18.566 --> 03:21.066
but still.

03:23.468 --> 03:24.937
What?

03:24.938 --> 03:27.005
Nothing. I just... I got to go.

03:27.006 --> 03:28.540
I've got breakfast
with Enzo, so...

03:28.541 --> 03:30.876
- Enzo?
- Mm-hmm.

03:30.877 --> 03:32.477
You guys go on one road trip,

03:32.478 --> 03:34.346
and all of a sudden,
you're breakfast buddies?

03:34.347 --> 03:35.814
Yeah, I guess so.

03:35.815 --> 03:37.582
Ironically, he's recently become

03:37.583 --> 03:40.018
one of the more stable
people in my life.

03:40.019 --> 03:44.017
Ok. Then invite him
to the party.

03:44.590 --> 03:46.892
- Elena.
- Come on. I got Matt

03:46.893 --> 03:49.161
to take the afternoon off
from his training

03:49.162 --> 03:51.263
and Tyler to give
the practice squad a break.

03:51.264 --> 03:53.498
Even Jeremy is coming.

03:53.499 --> 03:55.600
It's been forever since
we've all been together.

03:55.601 --> 03:57.802
It'll be fun.

03:57.803 --> 04:01.339
Don't make me invoke
the nuclear option.

04:01.340 --> 04:04.509
Because I will selfie bomb you
every 5 minutes.

04:04.510 --> 04:08.580
- Ok. Fine. I'll go to the party.
- Yay!

04:08.581 --> 04:11.649
But I'm not moving back in.

04:11.650 --> 04:14.718
That is a conversation
to be had over jell-o shots.

04:17.829 --> 04:19.564
Caroline: What did
Alaric do to her?

04:19.565 --> 04:20.933
All I know is she
doesn't remember

04:20.934 --> 04:22.267
whatever it is she saw in Damon,

04:22.268 --> 04:23.752
and we're supposed
to keep it that way.

04:23.753 --> 04:25.120
I just spent
the whole night with her,

04:25.121 --> 04:27.222
and it's weird.

04:27.223 --> 04:29.090
She just doesn't seem
like her old self.

04:29.091 --> 04:31.659
Yeah. It's because she's happy.
Isn't that the point?

04:31.661 --> 04:32.928
I guess.

04:32.929 --> 04:35.230
Look. I got to go.
I'll see you later.

04:35.231 --> 04:37.132
It's a little early
for a carwash.

04:37.133 --> 04:38.934
Oh, yeah. I brought
in some mulch

04:38.935 --> 04:41.236
so you guys could clean up
that little park on 4th.

04:41.237 --> 04:43.038
Turns out red mulch stains.

04:43.039 --> 04:45.740
- Who knew?
- My friends are having a party,

04:45.741 --> 04:48.243
and I'd like to go by this
afternoon after lunch.

04:48.244 --> 04:50.445
You need a permission slip?

04:50.446 --> 04:51.780
I'm not your mom. Go.

04:51.781 --> 04:54.015
And take Jay. Suckered
him into washing my car.

04:54.016 --> 04:55.183
He needs some fun.

04:55.184 --> 04:56.951
You're driving.
I'm drinking.

04:56.952 --> 04:59.521
Both of you,
keep your eyes open.

04:59.522 --> 05:01.955
We've had a lot
of animal attacks lately.

05:01.957 --> 05:05.492
- He means dog bite girl.
- Yeah. I know what he means.

05:07.530 --> 05:09.931
Sarah: That shower has 4 heads.

05:09.932 --> 05:12.233
Who's so dirty they
need 4 heads?

05:12.234 --> 05:13.434
You'd be surprised.

05:13.435 --> 05:16.304
You want bourbon
or, well, bourbon?

05:16.305 --> 05:20.141
I hate bourbon,
but I love this house.

05:20.142 --> 05:21.809
Can I just pretend
that I found my dad

05:21.810 --> 05:24.379
and it's whoever lives here?

05:24.380 --> 05:25.646
Trust me. It's not.

05:25.647 --> 05:27.815
Why not? My mom lived
in Mystic Falls

05:27.816 --> 05:32.019
for years before she had me.
Somebody had to knock her up.

05:32.020 --> 05:36.124
- You ever think about asking her?
- Oh. Good idea. Hurry.

05:36.125 --> 05:40.695
- Let's go to the cemetery.
- Gotcha. Sorry.

05:40.696 --> 05:45.299
- Who does live here anyway?
- Two brothers.

05:45.300 --> 05:49.035
One moved.
The other is dead.

05:52.840 --> 05:56.711
- Hey. Quick question.
- Quick answer. No.

05:56.712 --> 05:58.612
Hilarious. We're having
a party today.

05:58.613 --> 06:00.915
You think you could spare
a keg or two from scull bar?

06:00.916 --> 06:02.716
You can come.

06:02.717 --> 06:04.585
You and alcohol and my brother.

06:04.586 --> 06:07.688
Why does that combination sound
so familiar and terrible?

06:07.689 --> 06:09.490
Who is your trachea, Luke?

06:09.491 --> 06:12.860
In fairness, he apologized.

06:12.861 --> 06:16.506
I'm working on this, ok?
I watch my drinking,

06:16.507 --> 06:19.733
I avoid things
that make me angry.

06:19.734 --> 06:22.863
Come by the bar after 1:00.
I'll see what I can do.

06:25.539 --> 06:27.908
You're doing that thing again.

06:27.909 --> 06:29.577
What thing?

06:29.578 --> 06:30.778
Oh, the thing where
you're a bitch

06:30.779 --> 06:32.046
because you like somebody.

06:32.047 --> 06:33.948
It's pretty transparent.

06:33.949 --> 06:36.950
I don't blame you.
He's hot.

06:39.086 --> 06:40.888
Hey, cutebrag.

06:40.889 --> 06:44.391
- Did you just call me cutebrag?
- Hey. I didn't come up with it.

06:44.392 --> 06:46.994
Another one
of the volunteers did.

06:46.995 --> 06:49.129
What? Sometimes, you brag.

06:49.130 --> 06:50.931
At least it has "cute" in it.

06:50.932 --> 06:52.266
Small favors.

06:52.267 --> 06:54.301
I'm Liam, you're Elena.

06:54.302 --> 06:56.103
See how easy it is to remember?

06:56.104 --> 06:57.237
Brag.

06:57.238 --> 06:58.439
Is there something
you wanted other

06:58.440 --> 07:00.507
than to destroy my self-esteem?

07:00.508 --> 07:01.775
Actually, yes.

07:01.776 --> 07:03.644
Are you doing anything
this afternoon?

07:03.645 --> 07:06.647
My friends are throwing a party
just outside my hometown,

07:06.648 --> 07:08.948
and there's a girl
that I actually want you to meet.

07:11.151 --> 07:14.324
- Just come.
- Ok.

07:17.368 --> 07:18.996
Stefan?

07:22.062 --> 07:23.229
Hey.

07:26.199 --> 07:27.701
What...

07:27.702 --> 07:30.170
For the record, 4 months
is far too long

07:30.171 --> 07:31.471
for me to go without seeing you.

07:31.472 --> 07:33.106
I know. That's why I'm here.

07:33.107 --> 07:35.141
I wanted to stop by and say hi.

07:39.079 --> 07:41.581
I got it.

07:41.582 --> 07:42.783
Ok.

07:42.784 --> 07:46.186
We need strawberries, eggs,

07:46.187 --> 07:48.521
milk, and... ooh... candles.

07:51.191 --> 07:52.659
I know it's been a while,

07:52.660 --> 07:55.195
but you couldn't do
magic as an anchor,

07:55.196 --> 07:56.997
so I'm curious what
momentary lapse of reason

07:56.998 --> 07:59.666
makes you think
you can do it now.

07:59.667 --> 08:02.869
You know, when all this started,
you sucked at making pancakes,

08:02.870 --> 08:04.537
and now they're somewhat edible.

08:04.538 --> 08:06.873
Milk. There's no reason
to be peter pessimist.

08:06.874 --> 08:09.275
We have proof we're not alone.

08:09.276 --> 08:11.411
First of all...

08:11.412 --> 08:12.412
Don't nickname.

08:12.413 --> 08:13.847
That's my thing.

08:13.848 --> 08:16.683
And this proof,
this mysteriously filled in

08:16.684 --> 08:18.885
crossword,
could very easily have been you.

08:18.886 --> 08:20.587
I didn't fill it in.

08:20.588 --> 08:23.623
No. You don't know
you filled it in.

08:23.624 --> 08:25.558
You also don't know
that you talk in your sleep.

08:25.559 --> 08:28.261
Eggs.

08:28.262 --> 08:29.929
What are you saying?

08:29.930 --> 08:32.631
Are you saying
I sleep crossword?

08:32.633 --> 08:35.767
I'm saying it makes more
sense than the alternative.

08:37.270 --> 08:38.538
I get what you're doing.

08:38.539 --> 08:40.073
What am I doing?

08:40.073 --> 08:42.674
You refuse to have hope
that you'll see Elena again

08:42.676 --> 08:44.811
so you don't have
to be disappointed.

08:44.812 --> 08:46.746
I refuse to have hope because
there's nothing to hope for.

08:46.747 --> 08:48.246
Pork rinds.

08:50.283 --> 08:52.618
Not on the list and eww.

08:52.619 --> 08:54.020
No, Damon.

08:54.021 --> 08:56.355
There were pork rinds
here on this shelf.

08:56.356 --> 08:59.392
There have been pork rinds here
on every shopping trip we've had

08:59.393 --> 09:02.928
for the past 4 months.

09:02.929 --> 09:05.602
[Electronic chime
playing melody]

09:07.400 --> 09:08.981
You hear that?

09:11.804 --> 09:14.639
[Melody continues]

09:15.674 --> 09:17.610
Hmm.

09:17.611 --> 09:20.246
You hear that, Damon?

09:20.247 --> 09:23.208
That's what hope sounds like.

09:27.841 --> 09:30.363
This hospital thing,
it's a whole new look, huh?

09:30.814 --> 09:34.992
Yeah. Apparently
this color disguises

09:34.993 --> 09:39.397
all bodily fluids that I could
get covered in throughout the day.

09:39.398 --> 09:41.299
So far, it's been
mostly observation,

09:41.300 --> 09:43.768
but... I don't know...
I love it there.

09:43.769 --> 09:48.005
Seeing sick people getting better,
it's inspiring.

09:48.006 --> 09:52.053
You seem different.
You seem, um, happier.

09:52.915 --> 09:56.079
And you?
Are you happy?

09:56.081 --> 09:57.882
Caroline filled me in
a little bit.

09:57.883 --> 10:01.552
Oh. About the, uh,
dinner party from hell.

10:01.553 --> 10:05.322
Her exact words actually.

10:05.323 --> 10:07.491
And in between the ranting,
she may have mentioned

10:07.492 --> 10:12.349
something about a new job
and a new girlfriend.

10:12.350 --> 10:15.780
Ivy, right?
Is it Ivy?

10:15.781 --> 10:18.516
Stefan, it's fine.
Seriously.

10:18.517 --> 10:20.985
It's not weird, I promise.

10:20.986 --> 10:25.690
I'm just happy to finally
see you again, you know?

10:25.691 --> 10:30.786
It's been really rough losing
Bonnie the last couple of months...

10:32.831 --> 10:34.899
Which is an incredibly
insensitive thing to say

10:34.900 --> 10:36.400
to somebody who just
lost their brother.

10:36.402 --> 10:38.903
I'm... I'm sorry.

10:38.904 --> 10:42.273
No. I've been working on
the healing thing, too,

10:42.274 --> 10:43.875
I guess.

10:43.876 --> 10:47.812
Hey. Uh, by the way, have you,
uh, heard from Caroline?

10:47.813 --> 10:49.313
She's not returning
any of my calls,

10:49.314 --> 10:53.484
and I really want to apologize
for the way I acted.

10:53.485 --> 10:55.952
Well, she'll be there
at the swimming hole today.

10:55.954 --> 10:57.321
You should come.

10:57.322 --> 10:59.390
No, no. I'm not sure
I'm ready to dive

10:59.391 --> 11:00.758
back into all that.

11:00.759 --> 11:03.394
No pun intended.

11:03.395 --> 11:06.063
Stefan, they're
your friends, too.

11:06.064 --> 11:08.766
Come on. I know that we can't
hang out at the grill anymore,

11:08.767 --> 11:10.768
but that doesn't mean
we can't all spend

11:10.769 --> 11:12.603
time together.

11:12.604 --> 11:14.405
Come on, please.

11:14.406 --> 11:17.174
If not for that, then at least
to convince Caroline that Enzo

11:17.175 --> 11:20.478
is not new best friend
replacement material.

11:20.479 --> 11:22.880
Will Enzo be there?

11:22.881 --> 11:25.950
Yeah, but I can easily
uninvite him.

11:25.951 --> 11:28.119
- I'd rather you come.
- No. Don't worry about it.

11:28.120 --> 11:30.020
Um...

11:30.021 --> 11:34.859
- Yeah. Maybe I'll stop by.
- Great.

11:34.860 --> 11:36.794
Do you understand the rules?

11:36.795 --> 11:39.797
Yeah. Rule one...
Don't mention Elena

11:39.798 --> 11:42.266
was madly in love with Damon,
or you'll kill me.

11:42.267 --> 11:43.400
Mm-hmm.

11:43.401 --> 11:46.670
Rule two... don't really reference
Damon at all, or you'll kill me.

11:46.671 --> 11:47.771
Yeah.

11:47.772 --> 11:52.242
- Rule 3... wear sunscreen...
- Don't make fun of me.

11:52.243 --> 11:56.113
It's important that we let
Elena live her new happy,

11:56.114 --> 11:59.783
problem-ignoring zombie life
the way she wants.

12:00.151 --> 12:04.354
A sentence which sounded oddly
supportive and judgmental.

12:04.355 --> 12:07.057
I support her.
She did what she needed to do

12:07.058 --> 12:10.260
to stop chomping on
innocent people on the road,

12:10.261 --> 12:11.762
but it doesn't mean
that I'm enjoying

12:11.763 --> 12:14.398
marinating all alone
in my misery.

12:14.399 --> 12:17.188
Well, I'll marinate with you.

12:17.769 --> 12:22.139
I appreciate it.
Really, I do.

12:22.140 --> 12:24.741
But I'm not Stefan.

12:24.742 --> 12:28.145
Rule number 4... don't ever mention
that jerk's name again, or...

12:28.146 --> 12:31.481
Or you'll kill me.
Got it.

12:31.482 --> 12:34.951
Whoa! Is that blood or pie?

12:34.952 --> 12:36.019
Please say pie.

12:36.020 --> 12:39.456
Oh. That would be, uh...

12:39.457 --> 12:42.259
Shirley, a special
off-the-menu item.

12:42.260 --> 12:45.295
This little diner is
surprisingly well-stocked.

12:45.296 --> 12:48.430
Tell me that you
snatched, ate, erased.

12:48.432 --> 12:49.666
Funny thing about that.

12:49.667 --> 12:51.868
You do the first two properly,
the third isn't necessary.

12:51.869 --> 12:53.889
- You killed her?
- Oh, don't act all shocked.

12:53.890 --> 12:56.439
Well, I'm sorry,
but death shocks me,

12:56.440 --> 12:58.485
and it also leads
to a missing persons report,

12:58.486 --> 13:00.677
- which leads to...
- A sheriff's investigation?

13:00.678 --> 13:01.845
I'm terrified.

13:01.846 --> 13:04.077
I already have 3 warnings.
One more, it's a fine.

13:10.753 --> 13:13.990
It's got to be a short,
faulty wiring, something.

13:13.991 --> 13:18.027
Or someone put a quarter in it
and turned it on.

13:18.028 --> 13:23.099
You know, I'm a little confused
with all this misplaced hope.

13:23.100 --> 13:26.169
All right.
Let's just say there's someone here.

13:26.170 --> 13:28.338
How do you know
we're gonna get out?

13:28.339 --> 13:31.040
Well, you say that
this is your hell, right?

13:31.041 --> 13:34.310
If there's someone else here,
that means it's not your hell,

13:34.311 --> 13:36.245
and if it's not your hell,
that means grams put us here,

13:36.246 --> 13:39.685
and if grams put us here,
there's a way out.

13:39.686 --> 13:42.852
There's a hell of a logic
knot you've tied for yourself.

13:42.853 --> 13:44.754
Thank you.
So now that we've

13:44.755 --> 13:46.888
properly placed our hope,
let's play a game.

13:47.341 --> 13:49.125
When we get out,

13:49.126 --> 13:54.430
what's the first thing
you're gonna tell Elena?

13:54.431 --> 13:56.432
Sorry I killed Bonnie,

13:56.433 --> 13:58.567
but she was the most
annoying person

13:58.568 --> 14:00.236
in the world.

14:00.237 --> 14:03.039
She wouldn't shut up.
She just kept talking.

14:03.040 --> 14:04.240
I mean, it's a wonder
I made it as long as I did,

14:04.241 --> 14:06.542
but here's the thing.
I think it's better this way

14:06.543 --> 14:09.578
because she didn't have magic,
and she was pretty much useless.

14:09.579 --> 14:11.727
- Damon.
- What?

14:12.549 --> 14:14.949
I don't know.
You still think I'm useless?

14:19.755 --> 14:21.723
That's my car.

14:23.225 --> 14:25.094
That's my car!

14:25.095 --> 14:28.563
Elena: She's
determined but sweet,

14:28.565 --> 14:32.134
eternal optimist,
never forgets a birthday.

14:32.135 --> 14:34.436
What else?

14:34.437 --> 14:36.305
Never gives up on her friends.

14:36.306 --> 14:39.141
Yes. True. She's
completely loyal.

14:39.142 --> 14:41.110
This is good.
Build her up.

14:41.111 --> 14:44.279
I'm sure she'll live up to these
ridiculously high expectations.

14:44.280 --> 14:45.380
That's another one.

14:45.381 --> 14:47.316
Great at surpassing
expectations.

14:47.317 --> 14:49.751
- So she's perfect.
- Totally.

14:49.752 --> 14:51.587
Pretty much.

14:51.588 --> 14:53.288
So how long have
you two been together?

14:53.289 --> 14:56.458
Us? No. I'm... we're... heh.

14:56.459 --> 14:59.861
We're not, but, I mean,
we did at one point...

14:59.862 --> 15:00.862
Not anymore.

15:00.863 --> 15:02.164
Was that recent?

15:02.165 --> 15:04.333
Because you two seem
weirdly functional.

15:04.334 --> 15:06.934
Has it already been two years?

15:08.637 --> 15:11.707
Time flies.

15:11.708 --> 15:14.309
Vrrrmm, vrrrmm!

[Car idling]

15:17.747 --> 15:18.880
How much longer are
we gonna listen...

15:18.881 --> 15:20.849
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

15:20.850 --> 15:23.351
This sound is the opposite
sound of your voice,

15:23.352 --> 15:25.453
and I so enjoy it.

15:25.454 --> 15:29.657
How did it even get here, Damon?
Did you leave it here in 1994?

15:29.659 --> 15:32.193
I don't know, Bonnie.
It was 18 years ago.

15:32.194 --> 15:34.095
Has a lot going on that day.

15:34.096 --> 15:37.832
Ok. So you admit that it's
pretty unlikely that you did.

15:37.833 --> 15:39.334
Very unlikely.

15:39.335 --> 15:42.337
Which would stand
to reason that...

15:42.338 --> 15:44.172
Someone may have
put it here, Bonnie.

15:44.173 --> 15:46.340
Yes. I...

15:48.676 --> 15:51.146
Damon...

15:51.147 --> 15:52.312
I know.

15:54.282 --> 15:56.719
I'm gonna tell Elena
how much I love her,

15:57.786 --> 16:00.822
and then I'm gonna
apologize for killing you.

[Cloth ruffles]

16:03.359 --> 16:05.158
Wait. Did you see that?

16:08.162 --> 16:09.797
I did that time.

16:09.798 --> 16:11.732

So is a lake different
from a swimmin' hole, or...

16:39.023 --> 16:40.757
Swimming hole.

16:40.758 --> 16:43.460
Thanks for making me
sound like a redneck.

16:43.461 --> 16:45.362
Why? Where did you party
in High School?

16:45.363 --> 16:48.031
Oh. Somebody's house
or second house,

16:48.032 --> 16:50.300
whichever had the biggest pool.

16:50.301 --> 16:52.636
Huh. I guess I do brag.

16:52.637 --> 16:55.105
Yup. Now it's my turn to brag

16:55.106 --> 16:59.475
because I bet nobody at
your pool parties could do this.

Um, ahem. Jeremy?

17:29.907 --> 17:30.907
Oh, my God.

17:30.908 --> 17:32.508
Elena.

17:32.509 --> 17:34.010
Sorry to interrupt
what I'm sure was

17:34.011 --> 17:36.379
a heartfelt display
of true love,

17:36.380 --> 17:38.281
but I'm Jeremy's sister,

17:38.282 --> 17:41.818
and we were about to have
a nice little family chat.

17:41.819 --> 17:44.353
That's why I'm an happy orphan.

17:49.559 --> 17:51.960
You invited the girl
that I attacked?

17:51.962 --> 17:55.264
No. I brought the girl Caroline
compelled to forget you attacked.

17:55.265 --> 17:57.233
She doesn't know anything.

17:57.234 --> 18:00.136
- Jer, why would you even risk it?
- Because she looks good in a bikini.

18:00.137 --> 18:01.970
Can I go now?

18:13.516 --> 18:15.818
Yeah. I may be driving,
but if you puke in my truck,

18:15.819 --> 18:17.086
I'm gonna kill you.

18:17.087 --> 18:19.455
You know, dog bite girl's
kind of hot

18:19.456 --> 18:21.257
in, like, a trashy way, though.

18:21.258 --> 18:24.025
Why do you keep calling
her that... dog bite girl?

18:24.027 --> 18:26.228
Because it's ridiculous.
What kind of dog

18:26.229 --> 18:27.396
bites you in the neck.

Tyler: I don't know, man

What's up, Ty?

18:31.601 --> 18:33.769
I just got a text from Elena.
She wants to see us.

18:33.770 --> 18:35.538
Hold on.

18:35.539 --> 18:36.872
Are you telling me
that you think a girl

18:36.873 --> 18:38.674
with two puncture wounds
in her neck

18:38.675 --> 18:40.109
got bit by a dog?

18:40.110 --> 18:43.119
I think if that's what she said
then that's what happened.

18:43.120 --> 18:44.546
Then you're an idiot.

18:44.547 --> 18:46.448
And you're a wasted douchebag.

were outside grilling.

face our problems head-on.

- Yes. Absolutely I'm sure.

36:17.065 --> 36:19.200
I'm such an idiot.

36:19.201 --> 36:22.503
I spent all summer training
with a founding family member,

36:22.504 --> 36:24.171
thinking that he was
only worried

36:24.172 --> 36:27.140
about protecting old ladies
from getting mugged.

36:37.151 --> 36:40.354
Because this is how I wanted
to spend my Saturday night.

36:40.355 --> 36:42.456
Load them up.

36:42.457 --> 36:44.725
What the hell happened
to your truck anyway?

36:44.726 --> 36:48.095
It's a little complicated.

36:48.096 --> 36:51.264
I got this, dude.
I'll see you in a bit.

36:56.085 --> 37:00.507
Sad jocks are kind of
like sad clowns,

37:00.508 --> 37:04.714
you know, they're pathetic
but kind of hilarious.

37:04.760 --> 37:07.247
Not in the mood, Liv.

37:07.248 --> 37:09.716
Uh-oh. That sounded
like a threat.

37:09.717 --> 37:12.119
No. Just a request.

37:12.120 --> 37:13.386
Oops.

37:21.485 --> 37:22.929
Is this what you want?

37:22.930 --> 37:25.135
You want to see me break?

37:25.666 --> 37:29.369
You're right.
I'm sorry.

37:29.370 --> 37:30.937
It's just easier
for me if you're

37:30.938 --> 37:34.274
an aggressive unlikable dick.

37:34.275 --> 37:36.042
Why?

37:37.778 --> 37:41.580
So I don't have to worry
about falling for you.

37:58.189 --> 38:00.567
I checked every room.
Sarah is gone,

38:00.568 --> 38:02.402
and it looks like
she trashed the place.

38:02.403 --> 38:04.237
Oh, ok, ok.

38:04.238 --> 38:06.372
Well, Caroline and I will, uh,

38:06.373 --> 38:08.141
go out and search
near the border then.

38:08.142 --> 38:09.943
I'll keep looking in town.

38:09.944 --> 38:11.844
I'll call you
if I find anything.

38:17.650 --> 38:20.587
So I was just gonna
leave my clothes here

38:20.588 --> 38:23.489
while we look, if that's ok.

38:23.490 --> 38:25.158
Yeah. Of course.

38:25.159 --> 38:27.126
I also was thinking
that, you know,

38:27.127 --> 38:28.561
if there are vampire
hunters on the loose

38:28.562 --> 38:31.397
then living alone
right by their home base

38:31.398 --> 38:33.566
is probably not a good idea.

38:33.567 --> 38:36.803
Is this an official unpack?

38:36.804 --> 38:41.174
Because your moving methods are
just so confusing.

38:41.175 --> 38:44.010
Yes, this is an official unpack.

38:44.011 --> 38:45.277
Ha!

38:45.279 --> 38:47.524
I'm sorry I got mad
at you earlier.

38:48.347 --> 38:51.083
Sometimes, it just
seems like you have

38:51.084 --> 38:53.618
this secret way to move on.

38:56.389 --> 38:59.659
- Is this...
- Bonnie's?

38:59.660 --> 39:02.361
Yeah.

39:02.362 --> 39:03.863
There you go.

39:03.864 --> 39:07.233
You just discovered my secret
to moving on.

39:07.234 --> 39:09.634
Sometimes, I don't.

39:13.672 --> 39:16.075
I miss Bonnie.

39:16.076 --> 39:18.177
I miss Mystic Falls,

39:18.178 --> 39:20.110
I miss our old life,

39:20.111 --> 39:23.715
- I miss...
- Stefan?

39:27.720 --> 39:31.223
Yeah. I miss Stefan.

39:31.224 --> 39:33.692
Caroline...

39:34.427 --> 39:37.663
You and Stefan...

39:37.664 --> 39:40.992
Do you have feelings
for him or something?

39:49.308 --> 39:51.576
Yeah, I think maybe I did.

39:57.416 --> 39:58.717
[Sighs]

39:58.718 --> 40:01.753
Well, we should go ahead
and find that girl

40:01.754 --> 40:03.523
before she outs us.

40:12.798 --> 40:14.132
Rough night?

40:14.133 --> 40:18.036
Ahh. Nothing a piece
of pie can't fix.

40:18.037 --> 40:20.272
Service would be lovely, though.

40:20.273 --> 40:21.840
My fault. Sorry.

40:21.841 --> 40:24.743
I sent everyone
home for the night.

40:24.744 --> 40:28.979
Can't have you killing
any more of the wait staff.

40:28.981 --> 40:30.481
Unh!

40:34.052 --> 40:37.622
Consider being more
discreet when you feed.

40:37.623 --> 40:39.890
You never know whose
eyes are watching.

40:39.892 --> 40:42.527
I bet this normally
works, doesn't it?

40:42.528 --> 40:44.729
Knocks vampires right out.

40:44.730 --> 40:48.733
See, I'm a bit different
than a normal vampire.

40:48.734 --> 40:52.669
I can fight the vervain,
not for long, but...

40:54.239 --> 40:55.907
Long enough to take care of you.

40:55.908 --> 40:57.442
[Thwack]

40:57.443 --> 40:58.676
[Gun cocks]

40:58.677 --> 41:00.410
[Thwack]

41:04.315 --> 41:06.884
I found this
on one of your guys.

41:06.885 --> 41:09.621
I think he killed him, though.

41:09.622 --> 41:12.590
- Who are you?
- Stefan Salvatore.

41:12.591 --> 41:15.827
You and I have
something in common.

41:15.828 --> 41:19.796
One of the founding families.
Thank you.

41:22.166 --> 41:26.104
Actually...
If you don't mind,

41:26.105 --> 41:29.773
I have my own way
I like them to die.

41:37.148 --> 41:39.382
Just make sure it's painful.
