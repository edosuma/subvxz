WEBVTT

00:50.925 --> 00:52.177
<i>Hye-jin.</i>

00:52.260 --> 00:53.261
Yes?

00:53.970 --> 00:56.973
<i>When I go back down to Gongjin,
can you meet up with me?</i>

00:57.056 --> 00:58.099
Meet up?

00:59.017 --> 01:00.727
Of course, I can.

01:00.810 --> 01:03.229
<i>I really hope you can.</i>

01:03.313 --> 01:05.148
<i>I have something to tell you.</i>

01:05.231 --> 01:06.232
What?

01:14.657 --> 01:16.159
They fixed the streetlamp.

01:19.996 --> 01:22.916
<i>Hye-jin, are you there?</i>

01:22.999 --> 01:24.167
Yes, I am.

01:25.418 --> 01:27.754
Let me know when you're back.

01:28.254 --> 01:30.298
I'll treat you to a meal.

01:30.381 --> 01:32.425
<i>Okay. I'll see you soon.</i>

01:32.509 --> 01:35.011
Okay. Drive safely.

01:35.094 --> 01:36.763
<i>-I will.</i>
-Bye.

02:09.379 --> 02:11.714
Who are you?

02:12.799 --> 02:16.136
Who said you could enter my home?

02:17.470 --> 02:21.391
We have a home security system.
The police will be here in no time.

02:21.474 --> 02:23.351
I know there's no security system here.

02:24.727 --> 02:26.312
I had it installed yesterday.

02:26.396 --> 02:28.982
-What are you doing with your phone?
-What?

02:29.065 --> 02:30.358
Are you calling the police?

02:39.951 --> 02:42.370
There's no one to help you now.

02:45.999 --> 02:47.000
What the hell?

02:48.001 --> 02:48.960
Don't make a sound.

03:00.638 --> 03:03.558
It's a great night
to catch a sick pervert.

03:08.479 --> 03:10.481
Ms. Dentist. Are you all right?

03:10.565 --> 03:12.233
-Did he hurt you?
-No.

03:12.317 --> 03:14.819
-Are you really okay?
-I'm so terrified.

03:18.990 --> 03:21.409
Yes, this is 14 Abnaru-gil, Gongjin-dong.

03:21.492 --> 03:22.493
Hye-jin!

03:26.456 --> 03:28.082
Chief Hong!

03:52.273 --> 03:53.441
Chief Hong!

04:20.051 --> 04:21.719
My gosh.

04:21.803 --> 04:24.514
-What on earth happened?
-It was the damn pervert.

04:24.597 --> 04:27.308
He deserves to rot in prison.

04:32.897 --> 04:34.649
That was a close one.

04:34.732 --> 04:37.485
-He should rot in jail.
-Watch your head.

04:37.568 --> 04:39.654
-Can you believe it?
-What the hell?

04:53.626 --> 04:55.586
EPISODE 10

04:56.587 --> 04:59.966
There wasn't any nerve damage,
so stitches will be enough.

05:00.049 --> 05:01.634
I'll get back to you soon.

05:01.718 --> 05:03.261
Thank you, doctor.

05:07.807 --> 05:08.766
What a relief.

05:09.559 --> 05:10.685
Doesn't it hurt?

05:10.768 --> 05:13.521
Of course it does.
Even paper cuts hurt like hell,

05:13.604 --> 05:16.899
but the knife was this big.
At least 30cm, right?

05:17.692 --> 05:18.776
Don't exaggerate.

05:19.694 --> 05:22.530
It was a paring knife
with a blade length of around 15cm.

05:23.573 --> 05:25.241
I thought you'd still be in shock,

05:25.783 --> 05:28.661
but the doctor in you
calmed you down already.

05:31.581 --> 05:33.207
That bruise. Did he hurt you?

05:33.291 --> 05:34.959
Oh, it's nothing.

05:35.043 --> 05:37.587
What are you talking about?
You're hurt. Let me see.

05:37.670 --> 05:39.881
How bad is it? Does it hurt?

05:40.381 --> 05:42.967
Why didn't you tell the doctor
when he was here?

05:43.676 --> 05:45.470
Your injury is much worse.

05:53.436 --> 05:54.520
Ms. Dentist.

05:59.442 --> 06:00.485
Why are you crying?

06:02.195 --> 06:04.614
Gosh, I was so scared.

06:06.115 --> 06:08.576
Who jumps at a guy

06:08.659 --> 06:10.787
with a knife in his hand?

06:10.870 --> 06:12.705
I was just…

06:13.414 --> 06:15.124
I was afraid he might hurt you.

06:20.463 --> 06:21.464
Seriously.

06:25.760 --> 06:27.261
Seong-hyeon?

06:27.345 --> 06:28.387
Director Ji.

06:30.306 --> 06:32.350
Hye-jin, are you all right?

06:32.433 --> 06:34.435
How did you know I was here?

06:34.519 --> 06:36.062
Oh, well…

06:37.021 --> 06:38.523
I came back to pick something up

06:38.606 --> 06:41.359
then saw police cars
and your neighbors near your place.

06:41.442 --> 06:44.237
I rushed over here
as soon as I heard about you two.

06:44.320 --> 06:45.404
-I see.
-Right.

06:46.114 --> 06:48.491
Chief Hong, is the injury serious?

06:48.574 --> 06:50.368
No, it's only a graze.

06:50.993 --> 06:54.497
You seem more shocked than we are though.
Are you okay?

06:54.580 --> 06:58.292
Me? No, I'm okay.

07:00.962 --> 07:02.672
I was really worried.

07:03.339 --> 07:05.383
I'm so relieved that you two are okay.

07:08.636 --> 07:11.055
Well, I…

07:12.056 --> 07:13.641
I came back…

07:15.101 --> 07:17.270
because I forgot my tablet.

07:18.563 --> 07:21.983
I need to head back up with my hard drive.

07:22.066 --> 07:25.403
Now that I know you're okay,
I'll get going.

07:26.154 --> 07:27.613
At this hour?

07:27.697 --> 07:31.325
Yes. You must be really shocked,
so take good care of yourself.

07:32.326 --> 07:36.497
Chief Hong, thank you
for saving Hye-jin. I mean it.

07:37.748 --> 07:38.666
Don't mention it.

07:40.543 --> 07:41.502
I'll get going then.

07:41.586 --> 07:44.797
Right. Seong-hyeon--

07:45.631 --> 07:48.718
We're ready for you. I'm afraid
only one guardian's allowed to stay.

07:50.261 --> 07:53.055
Go receive your treatment.

07:53.139 --> 07:54.307
Sure.

08:05.818 --> 08:08.988
You jumped in front of a knife,
but you're afraid of needles?

08:09.572 --> 08:12.742
Anyone who has been burned by hot soup
flinches at the sight of it.

08:15.912 --> 08:17.038
Thank you.

08:19.123 --> 08:20.458
That was out of the blue.

08:21.918 --> 08:23.419
I don't think

08:24.128 --> 08:26.130
I thanked you officially yet.

08:26.214 --> 08:28.049
You did unofficially though.

08:28.132 --> 08:31.302
Look at me.
The way you've been looking at me.

08:32.762 --> 08:34.972
It's been shooting out words of gratitude.

08:36.557 --> 08:37.808
That's ridiculous.

08:39.685 --> 08:40.520
So what now?

08:41.729 --> 08:42.772
What do you mean?

08:42.855 --> 08:45.608
About tonight.
Your place is now a crime scene.

08:46.817 --> 08:47.902
Oh, right.

08:56.202 --> 08:59.789
Welcome, it's your…
No, it's not your first time.

08:59.872 --> 09:01.374
It's my third.

09:02.708 --> 09:05.086
As you know, three is a lucky number.

09:05.169 --> 09:06.379
Like <i>samseon jjajangmyeon</i>

09:07.171 --> 09:08.548
and best-of-three set matches.

09:08.631 --> 09:11.384
And they say the third daughter is
always the prettiest.

09:12.468 --> 09:13.469
That's so silly.

09:14.053 --> 09:16.639
Anyway, it's better
than staying home alone tonight.

09:16.722 --> 09:18.182
Mr. Pyo went to Seoul, right?

09:18.766 --> 09:19.600
Yes.

09:20.268 --> 09:23.563
Make yourself at home
and let me know if you need anything.

09:25.690 --> 09:27.817
I need clothes to change into.

09:28.651 --> 09:29.652
Right.

09:30.695 --> 09:33.239
Should I go fetch some from your place?

09:33.906 --> 09:36.909
Or would you like to wear
something of mine?

09:39.328 --> 09:40.496
Would they fit?

09:40.580 --> 09:43.165
-Would they be too small?
-Probably too big.

09:58.347 --> 09:59.181
I see you're done.

10:00.308 --> 10:01.726
The clothes are too big for me.

10:02.226 --> 10:04.812
They are not. They fit you like a glove.

10:04.895 --> 10:07.940
You know, you have such broad shoulders.

10:08.024 --> 10:10.651
What do you mean?
It's clearly too big on me.

10:10.735 --> 10:12.987
It's just that you have narrow shoulders.
They fit just right.

10:13.070 --> 10:15.031
You just have to have the last word.

10:15.114 --> 10:16.157
Anyway, drink this.

10:16.240 --> 10:17.617
What is it?

10:18.200 --> 10:21.203
Chamomile tea. Nothing's better
for relaxation and good sleep.

10:21.829 --> 10:23.748
Drink while it's hot.

10:25.207 --> 10:26.542
It'd better be good.

10:32.798 --> 10:35.217
-What is this?
-Keep it on you.

10:35.301 --> 10:37.511
It's easy to get aches
on a night like this.

10:37.595 --> 10:39.305
Your muscles must be in shock.

10:39.388 --> 10:42.558
Why do I need a blanket
on such a hot summer night?

10:43.392 --> 10:44.560
I'm good.

10:47.188 --> 10:50.524
You've got cramp.
See? This is what I was talking about?

10:51.817 --> 10:53.986
Let me see. Does it hurt a lot?

10:56.155 --> 10:57.406
What are you doing?

10:57.490 --> 10:58.824
Didn't you wash your feet?

10:58.908 --> 11:00.743
Of course I did.

11:00.826 --> 11:02.620
Then stay still.

11:03.204 --> 11:05.915
The spasm will get worse
if you don't treat it right away.

11:08.250 --> 11:10.961
Meow if you don't have
anything better to do.

11:13.881 --> 11:15.466
Meow…

11:16.884 --> 11:17.968
Lick your nose too.

11:19.512 --> 11:22.515
Forget it. You can stop now.
I think I'm good.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.351
Really? Are you sure?

11:25.434 --> 11:26.310
Yes.

11:28.145 --> 11:29.355
All right.

11:31.023 --> 11:34.318
What's with the special plates?
Is it someone's memorial service?

11:34.402 --> 11:35.236
My grandfather.

11:36.320 --> 11:37.363
When is it?

11:37.446 --> 11:39.281
Tomorrow. Hold on.

11:39.907 --> 11:42.118
It's past midnight, so today.

11:44.578 --> 11:46.205
Do you remember a lot about him?

11:47.289 --> 11:50.000
No, I don't.

11:50.835 --> 11:53.045
I want to remember everything about him,

11:54.296 --> 11:55.589
but it keeps fading away.

11:56.090 --> 12:00.511
His voice, his gaze, and his hands…

12:03.931 --> 12:05.766
He had rough palms, you see.

12:05.850 --> 12:08.811
He was a sailor who then ran an oil shop

12:08.894 --> 12:11.730
after my parents passed away,
so it's what you'd expect.

12:12.481 --> 12:16.819
But his hands were so big
and exceptionally warm.

12:17.653 --> 12:19.196
He raised me with them.

12:25.995 --> 12:29.415
I bet you were a troublemaker
when you were little.

12:30.082 --> 12:32.751
The boy in the photo
has "mischief" written on his face.

12:33.627 --> 12:36.005
I was absolutely
all over the neighborhood.

12:36.088 --> 12:40.301
I stole the squid
the old ladies had hung out to dry

12:40.384 --> 12:44.096
and played soccer all day
until my neck was badly burned.

12:44.180 --> 12:46.849
-Soccer?
-Yes, I loved the sport.

12:46.932 --> 12:50.603
Just like you,
I had a pair of shoes I loved so much.

12:51.604 --> 12:52.605
My blue soccer cleats.

12:52.688 --> 12:53.981
I see.

12:55.191 --> 12:57.026
Do you still enjoy soccer?

12:57.693 --> 13:01.322
No, I don't anymore.
I don't even watch it.

13:02.448 --> 13:03.616
Why not?

13:12.791 --> 13:14.084
<i>Because of soccer…</i>

13:16.045 --> 13:17.338
<i>No, because of me,</i>

13:19.298 --> 13:20.799
<i>my grandfather passed away.</i>

13:23.052 --> 13:24.470
<i>He had a heart attack.</i>

13:26.514 --> 13:28.140
<i>But he wasn't found in time.</i>

13:31.936 --> 13:33.771
If only I hadn't gone out…

13:35.606 --> 13:37.441
to watch the World Cup matches.

13:41.654 --> 13:45.741
Don't tell me you believe
that he wouldn't have passed away

13:46.367 --> 13:48.118
had you been at home.

13:53.832 --> 13:55.751
Those what-ifs are pointless.

13:56.794 --> 13:59.088
There are too many variables in this world

13:59.672 --> 14:01.882
and they're beyond our control.

14:03.842 --> 14:05.844
So it's not your fault.

14:12.476 --> 14:15.062
You've been thinking that way
all this time?

14:15.813 --> 14:18.399
Your grandpa must've been fuming
in his grave.

14:24.321 --> 14:25.489
Would he be that angry?

14:27.032 --> 14:28.033
Of course.

14:30.035 --> 14:31.120
Isn't this

14:31.620 --> 14:33.789
the first time you talked about yourself?

14:34.290 --> 14:35.374
You're right.

14:36.750 --> 14:39.253
You're the second person

14:40.254 --> 14:42.590
that I've told my personal stories.

14:45.426 --> 14:46.302
Second?

14:49.305 --> 14:50.598
How dense of me.

14:51.181 --> 14:52.850
Tea won't cut it, right?

14:53.559 --> 14:54.560
Are you done?

14:59.064 --> 15:00.065
Second?

15:21.420 --> 15:22.713
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

15:22.796 --> 15:25.090
Seong-hyeon, I enjoyed your show today.

15:25.174 --> 15:27.009
Me too. You have a great voice.

15:27.092 --> 15:28.636
Thank you so much.

15:28.719 --> 15:30.679
-My gosh.
-Gosh, he's handsome.

15:30.763 --> 15:32.514
He actually talked to us!

15:38.312 --> 15:40.689
Babe, you look stunning today.

15:43.817 --> 15:46.070
You should've dressed like this sooner.

15:46.153 --> 15:50.282
Hold on. Did you perhaps
dress up like this since it's my birthday?

15:50.366 --> 15:52.159
-Of course not.
-What?

15:52.242 --> 15:53.911
Don't be mistaken.

15:53.994 --> 15:56.163
It was for me, not you.

15:57.247 --> 15:58.874
-What?
-You heard me.

15:58.958 --> 16:01.460
You can wear
all the expensive clothes in the world

16:01.543 --> 16:04.254
but you look like the cheapest person,

16:04.338 --> 16:05.881
and I deserve better.

16:06.465 --> 16:07.299
Cheap?

16:09.134 --> 16:10.719
So you must've overheard me.

16:11.303 --> 16:14.014
Let me explain.
Let's talk somewhere private.

16:14.098 --> 16:17.601
No. I don't have any more time
to spare you in my life.

16:17.685 --> 16:19.812
The three months I wasted
is more than enough.

16:23.482 --> 16:25.526
Hye-jin!

17:03.105 --> 17:04.106
Seong-hyeon.

17:09.570 --> 17:10.446
Just a second.

17:25.294 --> 17:26.628
Thanks, Seong-hyeon.

17:28.589 --> 17:30.507
Those heels are pretty.

17:32.134 --> 17:33.469
You know,

17:34.136 --> 17:36.138
I spent two months' salary on these.

17:37.222 --> 17:40.184
My hands shook at first,
but I just went for it.

17:41.018 --> 17:42.728
Come to think of it,

17:42.811 --> 17:45.397
I had never bought anything for myself.

17:45.981 --> 17:49.401
You did good. You need to give
yourself a gift now and then.

17:50.569 --> 17:54.698
But I guess all pretty things have thorns.

17:55.741 --> 17:58.577
I didn't expect to see blood
on my first day wearing them.

17:59.661 --> 18:01.121
-Just a second.
-What?

18:02.831 --> 18:04.625
-These…
-But--

18:04.708 --> 18:07.169
It'll be better
if you soften the back of them.

18:07.252 --> 18:09.338
Nothing's easy at first you know.

18:09.421 --> 18:12.633
Whether it's wearing shoes
or being in a relationship.

18:16.512 --> 18:17.346
Here.

18:22.309 --> 18:23.435
Much better now.

18:25.437 --> 18:27.481
-Why don't we go eat something?
-Sounds good.

18:28.065 --> 18:29.358
-Come on.
-Sure.

18:58.595 --> 18:59.680
That was good.

18:59.763 --> 19:00.889
I could tell.

19:02.808 --> 19:05.727
I was only being polite
since you cooked it for me.

19:06.854 --> 19:09.648
Why did you insist on cooking
with a bad arm though?

19:09.731 --> 19:13.735
Well, I'm never going to let you
do anything in my kitchen again.

19:14.361 --> 19:15.362
Why not?

19:16.530 --> 19:17.614
Someone's calling you.

19:17.698 --> 19:18.740
MI-SEON

19:23.704 --> 19:26.665
Hey, Mi-seon. Did you get there safely?

19:26.748 --> 19:28.917
-<i>Yes.</i>
-And your mom's surgery?

19:29.001 --> 19:31.128
<i>She was just taken to the operation room.</i>

19:31.712 --> 19:34.256
The doctor told me not to worry
since the procedure

19:34.339 --> 19:35.549
isn't all that invasive.

19:35.632 --> 19:38.343
I'm sure it'll go well, so don't worry.

19:38.427 --> 19:41.305
<i>What about you? Is everything all right?</i>

19:41.388 --> 19:43.557
Here? Of course, everything's good.

19:43.640 --> 19:45.142
I'm fine.

19:45.225 --> 19:48.896
Don't hurry back,
and be with your mom as long as you want.

19:49.521 --> 19:50.814
<i>You're on indefinite leave.</i>

19:53.358 --> 19:54.443
We'll see.

19:55.861 --> 19:57.196
I've got to go.

19:57.946 --> 19:59.072
Good night.

20:00.532 --> 20:01.533
Sure.

20:05.662 --> 20:07.456
Here, drink this.

20:08.498 --> 20:10.209
-Thank you.
-Sure.

20:13.879 --> 20:17.507
You should head back.
You have work in the morning, right?

20:17.591 --> 20:20.260
It's my day off tomorrow. What about you?

20:20.928 --> 20:23.680
Well, after my mom's surgery is over,

20:23.764 --> 20:25.515
I'll stay until she wakes up

20:25.599 --> 20:27.976
and leave early in the morning
when my sister comes.

20:28.852 --> 20:30.687
Hye-jin told me to stay here,

20:31.188 --> 20:32.856
but I should still go to work.

20:32.940 --> 20:34.066
We can go together then.

20:34.149 --> 20:35.234
Gosh, no.

20:36.193 --> 20:39.196
Pulling an all-nighter
will only exhaust you.

20:41.114 --> 20:44.243
Besides, I feel bad
you had to run into my father.

20:44.326 --> 20:47.746
It's all right.
I'm more worried about you than myself.

20:50.958 --> 20:55.003
You must be exhausted,
so get some shuteye.

20:55.087 --> 20:57.756
I'll wake you up
as soon as your mother comes out.

21:01.301 --> 21:03.595
But you must be more tired than I am.

21:05.305 --> 21:07.224
I'm used to working the late shift.

21:11.979 --> 21:13.146
So I'm not tired at all.

21:39.172 --> 21:41.133
Don't just stand there. Come lie down.

21:42.968 --> 21:46.847
I feel bad about chasing an injured man
out of his own bed.

21:46.930 --> 21:49.182
Think of it
being reserved for the spooked.

21:49.266 --> 21:50.100
All right, then.

21:56.440 --> 21:59.609
You don't think
someone might break in again, do you?

21:59.693 --> 22:00.819
With me here?

22:00.902 --> 22:02.404
I meant, into my place.

22:02.487 --> 22:06.408
If you want, I'll install
a front gate tomorrow.

22:06.491 --> 22:08.035
What if someone climbs over it?

22:08.118 --> 22:10.287
Then I'll put up a wire fence. No, wait.

22:10.954 --> 22:12.289
Let's plant mines instead.

22:13.915 --> 22:15.625
I'm just saying you can be at ease.

22:17.085 --> 22:18.420
-My gosh!
-What the hell?

22:20.005 --> 22:21.214
What was that?

22:21.965 --> 22:23.133
It was only the wind.

22:23.216 --> 22:25.510
Darn it, it's unusually strong tonight.

22:26.094 --> 22:27.346
-The wind?
-Yes.

22:27.429 --> 22:28.722
It came out of nowhere.

22:31.349 --> 22:33.310
-What now?
-Hey, Bugyeong!

22:33.935 --> 22:36.396
-Bugyeong, you…
-Who's Bugyeong?

22:37.022 --> 22:38.231
Gosh, that startled me.

22:38.899 --> 22:41.193
It's the fishing village chief's dog.

22:41.276 --> 22:44.029
-I see.
-He must've eaten something funny.

22:44.112 --> 22:46.531
He's been howling like a wolf for days.

22:47.741 --> 22:51.078
I see. Well, sweet dreams, Bugyeong.

22:51.703 --> 22:52.871
-Good night.
-Bugyeong--

22:54.539 --> 22:55.373
Go to sleep now.

22:55.457 --> 22:57.042
-Sure.
-I'll be outside.

22:57.125 --> 22:58.460
Okay.

23:09.304 --> 23:11.890
So you'd rather stay up all night here?

23:12.724 --> 23:15.977
What else can I do when I can't sleep?

23:16.770 --> 23:18.146
You can go to bed.

23:18.230 --> 23:20.023
I'll put you to sleep in five seconds.

23:21.650 --> 23:24.277
-How?
-Just lie down. You'll find out.

23:29.491 --> 23:30.492
All right.

23:45.132 --> 23:46.341
Wait. Is that poetry?

23:46.424 --> 23:49.719
Yes. To those who don't read
a lot of books like you,

23:50.262 --> 23:51.388
this works like a charm.

23:51.471 --> 23:52.931
I read a lot of books, you know.

23:53.014 --> 23:55.559
Name one that inspired you
in five seconds.

23:55.642 --> 23:57.727
-Five, four--
-Get reading.

23:58.478 --> 24:00.105
Here I go then.

24:00.772 --> 24:01.773
Well…

24:04.276 --> 24:05.819
You can keep listening

24:05.902 --> 24:07.279
or go to sleep.

24:08.780 --> 24:09.698
"<i>Doorkeeper</i>.

24:10.240 --> 24:12.325
'You can't be here.'

24:12.409 --> 24:14.578
Saying that is my job.

24:15.871 --> 24:19.457
It is my job to deny your purpose.

24:20.959 --> 24:24.546
It is also my job
to deny you the next day again.

24:25.714 --> 24:29.968
And waiting for you the next day
in order to deny you

24:30.051 --> 24:31.303
is also my job.

24:32.762 --> 24:35.515
It is my job to fall in love with you

24:36.099 --> 24:38.435
while waiting for you

24:38.518 --> 24:40.103
the next day.

24:40.187 --> 24:41.980
Thus, denying my love…"

25:05.295 --> 25:06.880
Chief Hong.

25:08.298 --> 25:10.175
Who is

25:11.384 --> 25:13.887
the first person you told

25:14.930 --> 25:16.264
about your grandfather?

25:17.474 --> 25:19.226
There was this person.

25:20.268 --> 25:23.313
Someone very warm-hearted.

25:24.522 --> 25:25.690
Damn it.

26:02.018 --> 26:05.772
What? The pervert
that broke into Dr. Yoon's place

26:05.855 --> 26:09.234
is the one who tried to abduct Ms. Yu?

26:09.317 --> 26:10.735
-Exactly.
-My gosh.

26:10.819 --> 26:13.363
I just got back
from testifying at the police station.

26:13.446 --> 26:14.906
-No way.
-Lieutenant Kim said

26:14.990 --> 26:16.533
he has 11 priors.

26:16.616 --> 26:17.742
-What?
-Eleven priors?

26:17.826 --> 26:20.787
They found a truckload of
women's clothes that he'd stolen.

26:20.870 --> 26:22.998
Remember that red bra of mine I mentioned?

26:23.081 --> 26:24.416
He's the one who took it.

26:24.499 --> 26:26.376
It was among the items he stole.

26:26.459 --> 26:27.794
That son of a bitch.

26:27.877 --> 26:30.005
-He must've stolen my dress then!
-Right.

26:30.088 --> 26:34.718
My gosh. When did that foul man
come to live here in Gongjin?

26:34.801 --> 26:36.386
About two months ago,

26:37.137 --> 26:39.431
after wandering around
after getting out of prison.

26:39.514 --> 26:41.308
But he couldn't shake the habit.

26:41.391 --> 26:43.310
That damn pervert!

26:43.393 --> 26:46.730
He deserves to have
his limbs ripped piece by piece.

26:46.813 --> 26:49.190
That son of a bitch deserves hell.

26:49.274 --> 26:52.360
-That pervert--
-Can I see him if I go to the station?

26:52.444 --> 26:53.653
You foolish…

26:53.737 --> 26:55.905
By the way, is it Sunday?
Why are you here?

26:55.989 --> 26:57.574
You should be in school!

26:57.657 --> 26:59.868
-Yes, you should be in school.
-Stop nagging me!

26:59.951 --> 27:01.328
-Go on.
-You'll be late again.

27:01.411 --> 27:02.495
-Hye-jin!
-You--

27:02.579 --> 27:03.705
My gosh.

27:03.788 --> 27:06.624
I'll text you later,
so tell me all the details. Bye!

27:06.708 --> 27:09.044
-Dr. Yoon!
-Dr. Yoon, are you all right?

27:09.127 --> 27:10.462
Hello, all.

27:10.545 --> 27:12.464
I was so shocked to hear what happened.

27:12.547 --> 27:14.841
I heard he cut your arm with a knife.

27:14.924 --> 27:16.676
It must hurt. Oh, dear.

27:16.760 --> 27:18.720
Goodness. Dr. Yoon,

27:18.803 --> 27:21.389
you look haggard now.

27:21.473 --> 27:24.517
-Are you all right?
-Once again, rumors travel fast.

27:24.601 --> 27:27.187
I'll tell you.
I'm fine, so don't worry about me.

27:27.270 --> 27:29.981
And as you can see,
Ms. Dentist seems fine too.

27:30.065 --> 27:31.524
Who are you to speak for me?

27:31.608 --> 27:33.026
She's right. Be quiet.

27:33.109 --> 27:34.819
Anyway, I'm fine.

27:35.362 --> 27:37.113
I'm sorry for concerning you.

27:37.197 --> 27:40.367
Please don't say that.
As your landlady, I'm completely ashamed.

27:41.034 --> 27:43.036
I'll get you a security system right away.

27:43.119 --> 27:44.496
-Yes, you should.
-Thank you.

27:44.579 --> 27:47.457
In the meantime, have this calming pill.

27:47.540 --> 27:50.001
Taking this when you've been startled

27:50.085 --> 27:54.089
will calm your heart right back down.
Have it now.

27:54.172 --> 27:56.132
There. Go ahead.

27:56.216 --> 27:57.759
-Thank you.
-Sure thing.

27:57.842 --> 28:00.220
There you go.

28:00.303 --> 28:02.680
Chew and swallow even though it's bitter.

28:02.764 --> 28:04.933
Ms. Gam-ri, what about me? Where's mine?

28:05.433 --> 28:08.770
Well, I only had one at home.

28:08.853 --> 28:10.730
I'll get you one later on.

28:10.814 --> 28:13.191
Dr. Yoon, I brought this from my store.

28:13.274 --> 28:14.818
Have some honey water.

28:14.901 --> 28:16.486
What? Again, where's mine?

28:16.569 --> 28:18.446
-Seriously?
-Because I only had one.

28:20.073 --> 28:22.534
Are you actually on your way to work?

28:22.617 --> 28:24.702
Shouldn't you be taking the day off?

28:24.786 --> 28:27.080
I can't let the clinic close for the day.

28:27.163 --> 28:29.666
Then stay right here.
I'll get you a cup of coffee.

28:29.749 --> 28:32.585
-Your favorite, iced Americano.
-No, it's fine.

28:32.669 --> 28:35.130
I just want to get you some, so wait here.

28:35.213 --> 28:36.047
What about me?

28:36.131 --> 28:37.590
-Where's mine?
-Stop it.

28:37.674 --> 28:40.051
By the way,

28:40.135 --> 28:42.804
how did Chief Hong
come to your aid last night?

28:42.887 --> 28:44.681
I'm glad he did,

28:45.265 --> 28:49.519
but were you two there together
that late at night?

28:49.602 --> 28:51.104
This I should hear.

28:51.187 --> 28:55.191
Right? You guys
showed up here together as well.

28:56.443 --> 28:57.694
My gosh.

28:57.777 --> 29:00.196
I have to say,
the curiosity is killing me.

29:00.822 --> 29:03.032
Why on earth are you all giggling?

29:04.409 --> 29:05.994
Because we're curious.

29:06.661 --> 29:07.495
Gosh.

29:10.331 --> 29:14.461
Is it just me, or is everyone
more worried about you than me?

29:17.046 --> 29:18.631
Why do you keep following me?

29:18.715 --> 29:20.759
You'll end up at the clinic at this rate.

29:20.842 --> 29:22.010
That's where I'm headed.

29:23.136 --> 29:24.137
Why?

29:24.220 --> 29:26.014
To get a free cup of coffee.

29:26.097 --> 29:28.725
Today, I'm craving instant coffee.

29:29.517 --> 29:31.311
We do serve a great instant coffee.

29:31.936 --> 29:33.521
-Hye-jin!
-Du-sik!

29:34.522 --> 29:35.398
Hey, Eun-cheol.

29:35.482 --> 29:36.608
Mi-seon.

29:36.691 --> 29:38.109
How come you're here together?

29:38.193 --> 29:40.236
We heard about what happened last night.

29:40.320 --> 29:41.738
Are you all right?

29:41.821 --> 29:44.491
Why didn't you say anything
when I called last night?

29:44.574 --> 29:46.034
I didn't want you to worry.

29:46.117 --> 29:47.744
I'm fine, so don't worry.

29:49.037 --> 29:50.038
How's your mom?

29:50.121 --> 29:52.499
Yes, her surgery went well.

29:52.582 --> 29:54.459
It's all thanks to you.

29:54.542 --> 29:56.211
That's a relief.

29:56.294 --> 29:58.129
I told you to stay by her side.

29:58.213 --> 30:00.089
Why did you hurry back here?

30:00.173 --> 30:02.050
Well, I'm glad I did.

30:02.133 --> 30:04.344
Look what happened overnight!

30:05.011 --> 30:06.221
My gosh.

30:06.721 --> 30:08.598
I won't leave you ever again.

30:08.681 --> 30:11.601
I'll be right next to you
as if we were joined at the hip.

30:16.439 --> 30:18.066
Talk about déjà vu.

30:18.149 --> 30:19.150
Tell me about it.

30:20.235 --> 30:22.570
Are you all right though?
I heard you hurt your arm.

30:22.654 --> 30:24.072
Where does it hurt?

30:24.155 --> 30:25.573
-Which--
-Let go.

30:28.660 --> 30:30.495
-Were you terrified?
-Yes.

30:30.578 --> 30:32.038
-Are you crying?
-It was scary.

30:32.789 --> 30:34.582
-Of course.
-But…

30:41.631 --> 30:43.758
What's the deal with Officer Choi?

30:43.842 --> 30:45.426
Oh, that?

30:46.928 --> 30:50.473
Well, he drove me
to the hospital in Seoul.

30:51.641 --> 30:55.353
He even stayed with me
until my mom was out of surgery,

30:55.436 --> 30:56.604
and drove me back here.

30:56.688 --> 30:58.189
What?

30:58.273 --> 31:00.859
That's what I call
being taken out of the friend zone.

31:00.942 --> 31:03.570
While he sat with me outside the OR,

31:04.195 --> 31:05.822
I was reminded of old memories.

31:06.489 --> 31:08.825
When my dad was hospitalized,

31:09.784 --> 31:12.370
Pil-seung never came to visit him
at the hospital.

31:13.705 --> 31:16.040
He was afraid
my parents might bring up marriage

31:17.208 --> 31:18.710
if he met them.

31:20.670 --> 31:22.964
I knew we should've killed
that rat bastard.

31:23.047 --> 31:27.176
At first, it was Eun-cheol's looks
that I was drawn to.

31:28.219 --> 31:32.432
My heart beats faster for those
who look like Hong Kong movie stars.

31:32.515 --> 31:34.475
-Right.
-But now I'm in trouble.

31:38.396 --> 31:40.148
I think I'm in love with him.

31:41.441 --> 31:43.860
Wait. Isn't that a good thing though?

31:53.536 --> 31:57.457
Yeong-guk,
I've never had any romantic feelings

31:58.708 --> 31:59.918
for you.

32:00.001 --> 32:03.546
I hope we can continue being good friends.

32:06.215 --> 32:11.137
<i>You'll never know why I wanted a divorce.</i>

32:11.220 --> 32:13.973
Fine. Let's keep it that way forever.

32:14.599 --> 32:15.725
Just live your life.

32:27.654 --> 32:29.530
My goodness. You startled me.

32:29.614 --> 32:31.991
Why are you acting like you saw a ghost?

32:32.825 --> 32:36.454
Damn it.
The stress could actually kill me.

32:37.872 --> 32:39.165
Always the scaredy-cat.

32:39.248 --> 32:40.541
So what brings you by?

32:40.625 --> 32:42.585
I'm here on official business, sir.

32:42.669 --> 32:45.546
Is that so? Then have a seat, ma'am.

32:54.889 --> 32:58.601
I'm sure you're aware of the unfortunate
incident that took place last night.

32:58.685 --> 33:02.146
Yes. I mean, yes, ma'am.

33:02.230 --> 33:05.316
So the zone chiefs
and area chiefs discussed

33:05.400 --> 33:08.903
and decided to form
a civilian patrol unit.

33:09.487 --> 33:10.947
And that's final.

33:11.030 --> 33:13.074
So you discuss it with City Hall

33:13.157 --> 33:15.410
to get us extra security measures

33:15.493 --> 33:18.079
such as security cameras and alarm bells.

33:19.205 --> 33:21.457
-Answer me.
-Sure.

33:21.958 --> 33:24.252
Don't just say yes, and do it.

33:24.335 --> 33:26.796
I'll be counting the days starting today.

33:29.215 --> 33:30.758
Hold on a second.

33:31.759 --> 33:33.052
Are you leaving already?

33:33.136 --> 33:35.096
I said my piece, so why should I stay?

33:35.179 --> 33:36.472
Well, I'm not done yet.

33:36.973 --> 33:39.392
We need to talk about a private matter.

33:41.394 --> 33:44.105
-What you said yesterday--
-I have nothing more to say.

33:44.188 --> 33:45.982
-Hwa-jeong, please. I--
-Hello?

33:46.065 --> 33:47.525
Hey, Yun-gyeong.

33:48.234 --> 33:50.153
Yes, sure thing.

33:50.236 --> 33:51.904
I should be there today.

33:51.988 --> 33:54.449
Yes, of course. Got it.

33:54.532 --> 33:55.908
What is it?

33:56.659 --> 33:58.244
What the hell is it?

33:58.327 --> 34:01.914
Tell me what it is. It's driving me nuts!

34:01.998 --> 34:04.417
Just tell me already!

34:04.500 --> 34:07.754
Fix it for me!

34:07.837 --> 34:10.256
Dad, please!

34:10.339 --> 34:12.341
Bo-ra, come on.

34:12.425 --> 34:14.635
How can you act this way

34:14.719 --> 34:17.513
when your parents work
their fingers to the bone

34:17.597 --> 34:19.932
to provide for you?

34:20.016 --> 34:22.727
I-jun, I'm fine.

34:23.394 --> 34:26.189
I'm a merciful saint.

34:26.272 --> 34:30.151
My game console!

34:30.234 --> 34:32.737
What's with this quiet yet familiar scene?

34:32.820 --> 34:34.655
-Hey.
-Hi, Uncle Hong.

34:34.739 --> 34:36.491
Hey, I-jun.

34:36.574 --> 34:40.828
Bo-ra, who on earth upset you?

34:40.912 --> 34:44.874
Uncle Du-sik,
Dad won't fix my game console.

34:44.957 --> 34:48.461
Is that so? Is that what upset you?

34:48.544 --> 34:51.923
Oh, my. Look at these big drops of tears.

34:52.590 --> 34:55.760
But you should know
it's not that he won't fix it.

34:55.843 --> 34:56.761
He just can't.

34:57.345 --> 34:58.721
He's a fool, you see.

34:58.805 --> 35:01.182
No matter what happens,

35:01.265 --> 35:03.768
-I will not lose my cool.
-I'll fix it for you.

35:03.851 --> 35:05.394
I'm a genius.

35:05.478 --> 35:08.648
Where is it? I-jun, can you get it for me?

35:08.731 --> 35:09.857
Thanks.

35:09.941 --> 35:13.027
Let me see. So this is it.

35:13.111 --> 35:14.195
Screwdriver.

35:15.780 --> 35:18.366
You seem fine for someone
who got nicked by a knife.

35:18.449 --> 35:20.076
-Are you disappointed?
-No.

35:20.660 --> 35:22.995
I'm relieved, that's all.

35:23.955 --> 35:25.706
I guess I was worried.

35:26.624 --> 35:28.251
-I have an order to place.
-Don't.

35:28.334 --> 35:30.336
-It's--
-Hey, Yun-gyeong.

35:30.419 --> 35:33.506
I called to say that I'm closing up
my hardware store for good.

35:33.589 --> 35:36.843
-It's--
-You're busy, so I should shut up?

35:36.926 --> 35:38.553
-It's--
-I love you too.

35:38.636 --> 35:39.804
-It's--
-Don't say it.

35:39.887 --> 35:40.763
-Hey--
-Quiet.

35:40.847 --> 35:42.890
-I'm merciful.
-Your dad is what?

35:42.974 --> 35:44.892
-A fool. And I'm what?
-I'm a saint.

35:44.976 --> 35:48.855
PLACEMENT OF ORDER
WINDOW LOCK

35:54.902 --> 35:56.028
Wait.

35:56.112 --> 35:57.697
Isn't that Director Ji's car?

36:17.675 --> 36:19.802
WRITER WANG

36:23.347 --> 36:24.223
Hello?

36:24.307 --> 36:25.975
Are you insane?

36:26.058 --> 36:28.769
How can the main director
not show up for editing?

36:29.729 --> 36:32.273
You're right to call me insane.

36:32.815 --> 36:35.026
<i>What is it? Where are you right now?</i>

36:36.736 --> 36:37.737
In Gongjin.

36:37.820 --> 36:39.989
What? Why are you still there?

36:41.115 --> 36:42.116
No way.

36:43.409 --> 36:45.203
Does this concern your good luck charm?

36:46.245 --> 36:47.288
Dr. Yoon?

36:50.541 --> 36:52.210
<i>I've known you for seven years,</i>

36:52.293 --> 36:53.794
<i>but I've never seen you this way.</i>

36:53.878 --> 36:54.962
Seong-hyeon.

36:56.297 --> 36:59.217
A ship can't be navigated properly
without its captain.

37:00.218 --> 37:01.135
Sorry.

37:02.887 --> 37:06.599
Ji-won, can you cut me some slack
just for one day?

37:08.267 --> 37:09.977
Just today.

37:11.145 --> 37:14.857
Starting tomorrow,
I'll pull myself together again.

37:16.108 --> 37:17.526
<i>It's just for today then.</i>

37:18.110 --> 37:20.196
<i>Don't let your personal life
affect work again.</i>

37:36.587 --> 37:38.923
Until when will you see me
only as a co-worker?

37:39.799 --> 37:41.759
CHIEF HONG

37:43.261 --> 37:44.929
But he doesn't have any relatives.

37:45.638 --> 37:47.890
Is he hosting the memorial service
all by himself?

37:50.685 --> 37:51.727
Aren't you getting off?

37:51.811 --> 37:55.314
I have a few things to sort out.
You should head home first.

37:55.398 --> 37:56.774
Should I wait?

37:56.857 --> 37:59.318
No, don't.
You must be tired from the long night,

37:59.402 --> 38:00.444
so go home and rest.

38:00.528 --> 38:03.030
Then come home before it gets too dark

38:03.114 --> 38:05.199
and call me if anything happens.

38:05.283 --> 38:07.743
Got it. See you later.

38:07.827 --> 38:08.869
Sure.

38:20.464 --> 38:21.590
Ms. Pyo.

38:26.971 --> 38:28.514
If you're free,

38:29.974 --> 38:31.517
can we have some coffee?

38:38.983 --> 38:40.484
Didn't you say coffee?

38:40.568 --> 38:43.529
Well, that's just something
people commonly say.

38:43.612 --> 38:45.906
I prefer beverages
that taste like herbal tonics.

38:49.368 --> 38:52.121
Anyway, I asked you to have coffee with me

38:52.747 --> 38:53.831
to say something.

38:53.914 --> 38:56.459
I have something to say too.

38:56.542 --> 38:59.587
Sorry? Then you should go first.

38:59.670 --> 39:00.755
Okay.

39:02.214 --> 39:03.215
Well…

39:04.300 --> 39:08.304
I wanted to thank you once again
for what you did yesterday.

39:08.804 --> 39:11.599
There's no need.
I just did what I needed to do.

39:12.183 --> 39:16.020
Right. Your occupation
requires you to serve the people,

39:16.645 --> 39:20.524
and you offered me your services
for two days.

39:20.608 --> 39:21.442
Right?

39:22.318 --> 39:23.319
Sorry?

39:24.904 --> 39:26.989
I've dated my fair share of guys.

39:28.699 --> 39:33.287
I was offended when you talked
about how easily I start dating,

39:33.371 --> 39:34.372
but you were right.

39:37.124 --> 39:40.586
And that time,
my feelings for you weren't serious.

39:43.214 --> 39:44.256
However,

39:45.007 --> 39:48.219
those feelings ended up
growing into something more.

39:50.012 --> 39:53.641
I'm scared that they might grow

39:53.724 --> 39:56.602
as big and tall as Jack's beanstalk.

39:57.603 --> 39:59.188
But that's not me, you see.

39:59.855 --> 40:01.357
-Ms. Pyo--
-So I…

40:01.941 --> 40:02.900
So I…

40:04.235 --> 40:07.613
have decided to put a lid on my feelings.

40:09.156 --> 40:10.032
Sorry?

40:11.242 --> 40:14.495
I'll put some distance between us
so that you won't feel uncomfortable.

40:15.454 --> 40:20.084
So you can keep being comfortable with me

40:20.835 --> 40:24.505
and only consider me
as one of the citizens.

40:47.069 --> 40:49.113
ASSORTED <i>JEON</i> FOR SALE

41:06.213 --> 41:07.256
Is he inside?

41:07.339 --> 41:09.425
-No, I'm out here.
-My gosh!

41:09.508 --> 41:13.262
You startled me.
Don't sneak up on people like that.

41:13.345 --> 41:15.514
Is spying and being shameless
your specialty?

41:15.598 --> 41:17.183
You're in my yard.

41:18.851 --> 41:19.810
What brings you by?

41:19.894 --> 41:23.189
You said it's your grandfather's
memorial service today.

41:23.272 --> 41:26.525
You can't cook since you hurt your arm,
so I picked up some <i>jeon</i>--

41:26.609 --> 41:27.943
Chief Hong!

41:28.027 --> 41:29.987
-Hey, Dr. Yoon.
-Hello, Ms. Yeo.

41:30.070 --> 41:31.113
What brings you by?

41:31.197 --> 41:35.117
I cooked these as a snack
but made too much.

41:35.201 --> 41:37.077
Serve them for today's service.

41:37.161 --> 41:40.206
A snack? This is too much.

41:40.289 --> 41:41.290
It's really nothing.

41:41.874 --> 41:44.710
Starting from the bottom,
there's beef <i>jeon</i>,

41:44.793 --> 41:45.961
-croaker <i>jeon</i>,
-Croaker.

41:46.045 --> 41:50.508
pollack <i>jeon</i>, tofu <i>jeok</i>,
and flat meatballs.

41:50.591 --> 41:54.053
Nothing, did you say?
It doesn't get more luxurious than this.

41:54.136 --> 41:56.055
This is the least I could do.

41:56.138 --> 41:57.723
My family got out of the hole

41:57.806 --> 42:00.684
after we took over
his oil shop 20 years ago.

42:00.768 --> 42:02.770
We'll return the favor for generations.

42:02.853 --> 42:04.396
Is I-jun on board with that?

42:04.480 --> 42:07.983
I-jun's motto is to carry
one's gratitude beyond the grave.

42:08.776 --> 42:10.903
-I'll get going then.
-Thanks, Hwa-jeong.

42:10.986 --> 42:12.530
-Have a good day.
-Thanks!

42:12.613 --> 42:13.864
-Bye.
-Bye.

42:13.948 --> 42:14.990
Thanks!

42:15.074 --> 42:16.450
What were you saying again?

42:17.117 --> 42:19.828
Well, I bought some <i>jeon</i>--

42:21.163 --> 42:23.040
-Goodness.
-Hello, ladies.

42:23.123 --> 42:25.626
My gosh. Ms. Gam-ri, what is all this?

42:25.709 --> 42:27.419
-Give it here.
-Chief Hong.

42:27.503 --> 42:28.796
It's red snow crab.

42:28.879 --> 42:30.631
-Gosh.
-Let me take that.

42:30.714 --> 42:34.593
You're supposed to serve octopus,
but it's currently a closed season.

42:34.677 --> 42:36.679
So I steamed some crabs instead.

42:36.762 --> 42:39.557
-Gosh--
-I seasoned some vegetables for you.

42:39.640 --> 42:41.100
-Ms. Mat-i.
-Chief Hong,

42:41.183 --> 42:43.894
I made beef radish soup. It's still hot.

42:43.978 --> 42:45.771
Ms. Suk-ja, this must've been heavy.

42:46.730 --> 42:49.942
-I got you some pollack and halibut.
-I see.

42:50.818 --> 42:52.236
-Thanks, Nam-suk.
-Sure.

42:53.487 --> 42:55.990
I brought some jujube and chestnuts.

42:56.574 --> 42:58.492
Geum-cheol peeled the latter for you.

42:58.576 --> 43:01.537
You brought this over
when you're close to popping?

43:01.620 --> 43:02.705
-Du-sik.
-Hey, Chun-jae.

43:03.289 --> 43:04.707
These are apples and pears.

43:04.790 --> 43:06.667
-Gosh.
-I just found them on the street.

43:06.750 --> 43:08.794
-Watch it.
-Goodness.

43:08.877 --> 43:10.838
Since I can't cook,

43:10.921 --> 43:13.257
I bought some <i>hangwa</i> and <i>yakgwa</i>.

43:15.342 --> 43:17.261
-Dr. Yoon.
-Yes, hello.

43:18.012 --> 43:22.433
Everyone knows everything
in this neighborhood.

43:22.516 --> 43:24.018
As if it's anything new.

43:27.104 --> 43:28.480
Shouldn't you get on it?

43:28.564 --> 43:29.440
Yes, I should.

43:29.523 --> 43:30.608
Do you need any help?

43:30.691 --> 43:32.443
No, I can handle it on my own.

43:32.526 --> 43:33.569
Thank you, everyone.

43:35.195 --> 43:36.363
It's nothing new.

43:37.781 --> 43:39.325
We just have a lot of free time.

43:48.751 --> 43:51.170
I can't believe what I'm seeing.

43:51.920 --> 43:53.797
Are you really the dentist I know?

43:53.881 --> 43:56.133
Did someone assume your identity?

43:56.216 --> 43:58.093
That sure is a lame joke.

43:58.677 --> 44:00.596
Stop that and just take this.

44:02.264 --> 44:03.265
Just a second.

44:07.811 --> 44:10.731
-What are you doing?
-Didn't you buy this for my grandpa?

44:11.315 --> 44:12.733
I did, but--

44:12.816 --> 44:14.401
You got it from the market, right?

44:14.485 --> 44:17.905
My grandpa especially loved
their perilla leaf <i>jeon</i>.

44:18.530 --> 44:20.240
You sure have an eye for good food.

44:28.290 --> 44:29.958
MAY YOU REST IN PEACE

44:36.465 --> 44:38.008
I should get going.

44:38.092 --> 44:40.010
Enjoy your time with your grandfather.

44:40.094 --> 44:41.720
You can stay if you want.

44:42.388 --> 44:43.222
What?

44:45.349 --> 44:46.392
If you want.

45:21.885 --> 45:22.886
Grandpa.

45:24.555 --> 45:27.474
It sure is a feast today, isn't it?

45:27.558 --> 45:32.688
Everyone in the neighborhood pitched in.

45:33.188 --> 45:35.816
Please enjoy whatever you want.

45:37.067 --> 45:39.236
There's a lot that you like.

45:41.363 --> 45:42.614
Would you like to say hello?

45:51.331 --> 45:53.584
Hello.

45:53.667 --> 45:55.502
I'm Yoon Hye-jin.

45:55.586 --> 45:59.131
A 34-year-old dentist.

46:00.424 --> 46:01.717
I hope we get along.

46:03.469 --> 46:05.262
What's with the introduction?

46:06.221 --> 46:08.432
You told me to say hello.

46:10.642 --> 46:12.102
We'll eat in ten minutes.

46:12.186 --> 46:15.272
He was always a fast eater, you see.

46:22.321 --> 46:24.948
Chief Hong, you spoke in a dialect.

46:25.449 --> 46:28.952
This is my hometown after all.
I spoke in one when I was a boy.

46:29.036 --> 46:30.245
Right, of course.

46:32.998 --> 46:37.211
Snow crab at a memorial service
is a rare sight for me.

46:38.504 --> 46:41.381
It's my first time serving it.
He used to love it though.

46:41.882 --> 46:44.510
I see. You and him must have
liked different taste in food.

46:46.595 --> 46:47.804
You don't like snow crab.

46:48.972 --> 46:51.058
Me? Not at all.

46:51.892 --> 46:54.269
What? But that's what you said.

46:54.353 --> 46:56.939
What should we have? Snow crab?

46:57.523 --> 46:58.565
No. Something else.

46:59.900 --> 47:02.444
That's because
I couldn't be bothered at the time.

47:02.528 --> 47:04.863
I enjoy crabs,
but peeling them is a hassle.

47:04.947 --> 47:06.782
Besides, there are so many other dishes.

47:07.699 --> 47:08.700
I see.

47:19.127 --> 47:20.045
What are you doing?

47:21.421 --> 47:22.256
Did you just…

47:23.674 --> 47:25.175
peel if for me?

47:25.884 --> 47:28.679
Well, it must be even more bothersome

47:28.762 --> 47:30.264
with that injured arm.

47:33.225 --> 47:34.059
Thanks.

47:34.726 --> 47:35.727
Sure thing.

47:40.399 --> 47:41.400
Gosh.

47:44.194 --> 47:45.612
This was your plan all along.

47:46.196 --> 47:50.242
Of course not.
It landed near your right dimple though.

47:50.325 --> 47:52.452
-Where? Here?
-Here. Eat it.

47:52.536 --> 47:53.537
There you go.

47:54.204 --> 47:55.831
Unbelievable.

47:59.001 --> 48:01.128
You're doing this on purpose, aren't you?

48:01.211 --> 48:04.256
-Of course not. It really was a mistake.
-Aren't you?

48:04.339 --> 48:06.091
It won't happen again, so enjoy.

48:07.217 --> 48:08.176
Really?

48:09.553 --> 48:13.807
Shrimps and crabs are
too bothersome to eat.

48:14.391 --> 48:16.143
Compared to the effort you put in,

48:16.226 --> 48:18.145
the outcome is too small.

48:18.687 --> 48:20.314
It's still delicious though.

48:20.397 --> 48:23.984
I know. Come to think of it,
my grandpa is the only one

48:24.985 --> 48:26.528
who's ever peeled them for me.

48:28.113 --> 48:32.034
Right. Peeling these are a true hassle.

48:32.117 --> 48:35.370
It takes a lot of love
to do this for someone else.

48:45.839 --> 48:46.840
Well…

48:47.758 --> 48:51.053
However, right now,

48:51.637 --> 48:54.222
this is a special occasion.

48:54.806 --> 48:56.725
It's my fault you got injured.

48:57.267 --> 48:59.978
You're right.
This will take four weeks to recover.

49:00.896 --> 49:02.439
It hurts.

49:03.398 --> 49:04.691
-Just eat.
-Okay.

49:05.817 --> 49:06.818
It's good.

49:11.198 --> 49:12.324
It's really good.

49:18.246 --> 49:20.707
Wait. Let me walk you home.

49:20.791 --> 49:23.627
You don't have to.
You have a lot to tidy up.

49:23.710 --> 49:27.506
Forget about that. It's dark outside.
Think about what happened last night.

49:27.589 --> 49:30.133
I live right around the corner

49:30.217 --> 49:31.843
and Mi-seon's home today.

49:31.927 --> 49:34.054
-I can call her on my way home.
-But still--

49:34.137 --> 49:36.264
No, don't walk me out.

49:36.848 --> 49:38.475
Bye. Don't walk me out.

49:38.558 --> 49:39.476
But…

49:50.362 --> 49:52.239
Did I really say "love"?

49:52.322 --> 49:55.659
What the hell was I babbling on about?

49:55.742 --> 49:58.537
I should sew my lips together for good.

49:58.620 --> 49:59.621
Hey, Hye-jin.

49:59.705 --> 50:00.789
Seong-hyeon?

50:01.790 --> 50:03.291
Were you waiting for me?

50:03.375 --> 50:04.292
Yes.

50:05.335 --> 50:06.586
You should've called.

50:07.421 --> 50:09.214
How was your trip to Seoul?

50:09.297 --> 50:12.342
What? Oh, it was good.

50:12.426 --> 50:16.596
I asked you to spare me some time
once I got back from Seoul.

50:16.680 --> 50:19.725
Can you spare me some now?
Or is this a bad time?

50:19.808 --> 50:21.727
-Right now?
-Yes.

50:22.561 --> 50:24.396
We should eat. I'm hungry.

50:26.481 --> 50:28.191
Sure thing.

50:28.275 --> 50:31.611
I'm sorry about this.
I already had dinner.

50:31.695 --> 50:32.946
Are you okay eating alone?

50:33.029 --> 50:34.448
Yes, of course.

50:34.531 --> 50:35.907
Go ahead before the ice melts.

50:35.991 --> 50:36.992
Okay.

50:43.749 --> 50:45.500
-Hye-jin.
-Yes?

50:50.046 --> 50:50.964
Hye-jin.

50:51.798 --> 50:52.674
Yes?

50:53.675 --> 50:54.634
I…

50:57.220 --> 50:58.388
Hye-jin.

50:59.514 --> 51:01.099
Yes, that's me.

51:01.767 --> 51:02.601
Right.

51:04.352 --> 51:05.562
Jeez.

51:06.855 --> 51:11.610
I'm sorry to ask,
but could you say "Action" for me?

51:12.360 --> 51:13.278
"Action"?

51:13.361 --> 51:17.199
Yes, I practiced a whole speech for today,

51:17.282 --> 51:20.702
but I'm finding it
hard to actually say it.

51:21.286 --> 51:22.454
Can you do it for me?

51:23.622 --> 51:25.499
I don't know what this is about,

51:25.582 --> 51:27.000
but here goes. "Action."

51:30.253 --> 51:33.507
Hye-jin, there's one thing
I regret in life, and that's…

51:36.259 --> 51:37.427
And that's…

51:38.094 --> 51:39.179
What is it?

51:40.847 --> 51:43.141
Well, it's…

51:45.018 --> 51:46.186
You see…

51:46.269 --> 51:47.813
Seong-hyeon, could it be…

51:48.396 --> 51:49.439
Yes?

51:50.106 --> 51:52.484
Are you in financial trouble?

51:52.567 --> 51:55.821
What? No, that's not it.

51:56.363 --> 51:57.739
If that's the case,

51:57.823 --> 52:00.742
I could lend you some
although it wouldn't be much.

52:00.826 --> 52:02.494
Not telling you how I felt.

52:08.708 --> 52:12.003
I've been regretting
not telling you how I felt 14 years ago.

52:15.006 --> 52:18.593
Then I ran into you again in Gongjin,

52:19.177 --> 52:22.556
and I thought long and hard about it.

52:26.017 --> 52:31.064
I didn't know if the butterflies
in my stomach were due to my past feelings

52:31.940 --> 52:36.194
or if they're the feelings
I have for you currently.

52:37.779 --> 52:39.948
The conclusion I came to is this.

52:46.329 --> 52:47.789
I like you.

52:51.376 --> 52:54.212
Just like I did all those years ago.

52:56.089 --> 52:57.591
No, even more than that.

52:59.175 --> 53:02.512
I like you a lot.

53:13.815 --> 53:14.983
Gosh, please don't.

53:15.609 --> 53:17.402
I don't want to burden you.

53:17.485 --> 53:19.946
And I'm not asking
for an immediate answer.

53:20.030 --> 53:23.158
I just wanted to tell you
before it was too late.

53:24.326 --> 53:27.037
I didn't want to regret it again.

53:43.345 --> 53:45.805
My gosh.

53:45.889 --> 53:48.308
I think I can finally eat.

53:49.142 --> 53:50.685
I'll really have this all myself.

53:51.853 --> 53:54.147
Sure. Go ahead.

53:55.607 --> 53:57.692
This looks delicious.

54:02.781 --> 54:03.865
It's so good.

54:20.215 --> 54:21.091
Grandpa.

54:22.092 --> 54:24.010
My friend was a bit loud, wasn't she?

54:24.094 --> 54:25.929
That's just how she is.

54:26.012 --> 54:28.640
She talks and giggles a lot.

54:29.849 --> 54:32.686
You easily get distracted in her presence.

54:38.692 --> 54:39.693
Still…

54:41.987 --> 54:44.155
it feels empty now that she's not around.

54:53.456 --> 54:55.000
What took you so long?

54:55.834 --> 54:58.670
Oh, I met up with Seong-hyeon.

54:58.753 --> 55:00.338
He was waiting for me outside.

55:00.422 --> 55:02.590
For what reason at this hour?

55:03.216 --> 55:05.885
What? Did he confess
his feelings for you or something?

55:08.221 --> 55:09.222
Mi-seon.

55:10.223 --> 55:12.058
Get ready for a career change.

55:13.184 --> 55:15.562
You're firing me over a joke?

55:16.146 --> 55:19.274
No, I'm saying you should
set up shop as a fortune teller.

55:20.025 --> 55:21.151
Really?

55:21.943 --> 55:23.987
Right? What did I tell you?

55:24.070 --> 55:26.448
I told you
Seong-hyeon had feelings for you.

55:27.699 --> 55:30.827
Wait. Why don't you seem happy?

55:34.581 --> 55:37.167
It's just complicated, that's all.

55:37.250 --> 55:39.002
What could possibly be complicated?

55:39.085 --> 55:42.088
He's from a nice family and has
a good job and a great personality.

55:42.172 --> 55:45.050
He's the man of your dreams.

55:45.133 --> 55:47.719
Besides, you used to have a crush on him.

55:48.845 --> 55:51.306
Fate brought you together again,

55:51.389 --> 55:53.641
and he finally confessed his feelings,

55:53.725 --> 55:55.310
so what's holding you back?

55:56.478 --> 55:57.604
It's just that…

55:59.647 --> 56:00.982
Because of Chief Hong?

56:04.611 --> 56:05.528
Are you serious?

56:05.612 --> 56:09.157
No, it's not.
Anyway, that's enough about me.

56:09.240 --> 56:10.241
What about you?

56:11.034 --> 56:13.119
How are things between
you and Officer Choi?

56:13.703 --> 56:15.997
I told him I'd back off.

56:16.081 --> 56:19.000
-What?
-He's right, you know.

56:19.542 --> 56:23.630
I don't take relationships seriously
and I'm scared of commitment.

56:23.713 --> 56:28.051
But you finally met
someone you truly like.

56:28.134 --> 56:30.887
And I think
there's a chance for something real,

56:30.970 --> 56:32.263
but you're backing down?

56:33.556 --> 56:35.100
What's with us both?

56:39.020 --> 56:40.897
No wonder we're friends.

56:48.613 --> 56:50.740
How about we go to Seoul this weekend?

56:51.908 --> 56:52.826
Seoul?

56:52.909 --> 56:56.037
I mean, we'll never be able
to take our mind off these things here.

56:56.121 --> 56:58.748
And I could really use some diversion.

56:59.415 --> 57:02.418
We could go shopping
and eat something delicious.

57:02.502 --> 57:05.338
Yes, and have fun at a hotel!

57:05.421 --> 57:06.840
-Yes!
-Yes!

57:08.550 --> 57:11.261
<i>Let's do this
We're off to Seoul</i>

57:13.847 --> 57:15.515
Off we go.

57:16.516 --> 57:18.977
I'm stoked right now.
What should we do first?

57:19.060 --> 57:22.230
Isn't it obvious?
First, we visit your mom.

57:22.313 --> 57:25.442
No need for that. She already
got better and is now at my aunt's.

57:25.525 --> 57:28.903
Besides, she grew sick of me
after seeing me for two days in a row.

57:28.987 --> 57:30.321
Really?

57:30.405 --> 57:32.657
Then what should we do? Any ideas?

57:32.740 --> 57:35.535
Shopping? No, wait.

57:35.618 --> 57:37.203
How about a hotel pool?

57:37.287 --> 57:41.082
No, let's get a massage at the spa.

57:41.166 --> 57:43.001
Why choose when we can do them all?

57:43.084 --> 57:47.380
Seriously. Could you be any smarter?

57:48.590 --> 57:49.424
-Hey.
-Yes?

57:49.507 --> 57:52.927
I see you did your hair
for our trip to Seoul.

57:53.011 --> 57:55.555
Those are some sweet curls you put in.

57:55.638 --> 57:58.349
I know. The curling iron
worked well today…

58:01.603 --> 58:02.520
What is it?

58:02.604 --> 58:04.814
-Oh, no.
-What is it?

58:04.898 --> 58:07.817
Damn it. I think I left it plugged in.

58:07.901 --> 58:09.194
What?

58:09.277 --> 58:12.363
What do I do? Should we head back?

58:13.114 --> 58:14.032
Unbelievable.

58:14.115 --> 58:16.993
What are you doing? Who are you calling?

58:17.076 --> 58:18.870
-What?
-The emergency service?

58:18.953 --> 58:20.497
No, Chief Hong.

58:21.080 --> 58:23.041
Right, there's always Chief Hong.

58:28.129 --> 58:29.881
No. No way!

58:29.964 --> 58:31.966
Don't call Chief Hong. Hang up!

58:32.050 --> 58:33.927
-No, don't!
-Chief Hong?

58:34.010 --> 58:36.304
No! I'm serious. You can't!

58:36.387 --> 58:38.640
<i>Don't!</i>

58:38.723 --> 58:40.934
Is that Ms. Dentist?
Please tell her to be quiet.

58:41.017 --> 58:44.229
<i>Chief Hong, could I offer you an easy job?</i>

58:44.312 --> 58:45.188
What is it?

58:45.271 --> 58:48.691
Could you go to my place right now,

58:48.775 --> 58:52.403
enter Hye-jin's room,
locate the dressing table,

58:52.487 --> 58:55.031
and unplug the curling iron on it?

58:55.114 --> 58:59.160
What? You've got to be kidding me.
You can do that yourself.

58:59.244 --> 59:02.455
We're currently far away from the house.

59:03.665 --> 59:06.042
-Where?
-<i>In Seoul.</i>

59:08.419 --> 59:10.338
You went to Seoul? When will you be back?

59:10.421 --> 59:11.506
<i>Tomorrow.</i>

59:11.589 --> 59:14.676
<i>So please help us out this once.</i>

59:14.759 --> 59:18.054
You can't let us burn down
Ms. Yeo's house.

59:18.137 --> 59:21.349
Right, I'll get it done.
That's all you need, right?

59:21.432 --> 59:23.768
-Yes! He'll do it.
-No, wait.

59:23.851 --> 59:26.813
Chief Hong, all you need to do
is enter the house,

59:26.896 --> 59:29.315
<i>take a left, and unplug the curling iron.</i>

59:29.399 --> 59:30.400
<i>Don't look at--</i>

59:30.900 --> 59:32.026
He hung up.

59:32.610 --> 59:33.903
Damn it.

59:34.904 --> 59:35.822
Whatever.

59:35.905 --> 59:37.740
Yes, whatever.

59:37.824 --> 59:38.908
Let's just go.

59:51.087 --> 59:53.506
Who knew I'd be doing a job like this?

1:00:01.806 --> 1:00:04.851
Stay calm. You expected this.

1:00:05.852 --> 1:00:09.731
You didn't expect her
to keep the house pristine.

1:00:10.356 --> 1:00:11.357
That's right.

1:00:14.110 --> 1:00:15.445
Damn it.

1:00:18.740 --> 1:00:19.657
What the hell?

1:00:22.619 --> 1:00:24.370
Are you kidding me?

1:00:24.454 --> 1:00:27.832
I can't believe
they made me waste my time.

1:00:28.583 --> 1:00:30.585
Damn it.

1:00:35.923 --> 1:00:36.966
All right.

1:00:42.096 --> 1:00:43.097
Here too.

1:00:46.017 --> 1:00:47.018
Good.

1:00:47.727 --> 1:00:48.811
And now…

1:00:52.815 --> 1:00:54.734
All done.

1:01:04.952 --> 1:01:08.164
Hye-jin, look. Do you think it'll suit me?

1:01:08.247 --> 1:01:11.167
Yes, it's adorable
and will look good on you.

1:01:11.250 --> 1:01:14.212
Right? I guess I have my figure to thank.

1:01:14.295 --> 1:01:16.255
I should still try it on though.

1:01:16.339 --> 1:01:18.299
Sure. There's a fitting room over there.

1:01:18.383 --> 1:01:20.843
Really? Just a second. This is adorable.

1:01:34.148 --> 1:01:35.566
It'll look good on him.

1:01:37.735 --> 1:01:39.529
-Hye-jin!
-Yes?

1:01:40.571 --> 1:01:43.408
No way! Twirl for me.

1:01:43.491 --> 1:01:44.701
Wait. Like this?

1:01:44.784 --> 1:01:47.620
It's pretty. It's perfect for you.

1:01:47.704 --> 1:01:50.832
No, this isn't the one.
Let's go over there instead.

1:01:50.915 --> 1:01:52.834
-Sure.
-I bet they have prettier ones.

1:01:53.668 --> 1:01:55.128
Hey. What do you think of this?

1:01:58.005 --> 1:02:00.758
It's a nice shade of purple.
You should check it out.

1:02:20.570 --> 1:02:23.197
How is it? Is it good?

1:02:23.281 --> 1:02:25.074
It's so good

1:02:25.158 --> 1:02:28.453
that I wouldn't notice
even if the others stopped breathing.

1:02:28.536 --> 1:02:30.455
Must you always be that annoying?

1:02:30.538 --> 1:02:32.832
Is seeing me die something you want?

1:02:32.915 --> 1:02:35.168
I only meant it in a figurative sense.

1:02:35.251 --> 1:02:36.711
Ms. Gam-ri.

1:02:36.794 --> 1:02:38.254
How is it?

1:02:38.337 --> 1:02:41.549
Why do people even
have something like this?

1:02:41.632 --> 1:02:44.677
It's sickly sweet
and too cold for my teeth.

1:02:44.761 --> 1:02:46.679
But you enjoyed it the most.

1:02:47.555 --> 1:02:51.142
That's only because it's so hot.

1:02:55.855 --> 1:02:57.565
By the way, where's the restroom?

1:02:57.648 --> 1:02:59.233
It's right over there.

1:02:59.317 --> 1:03:00.735
Mat-i, I'm coming with you.

1:03:00.818 --> 1:03:03.696
Why on earth would you
follow me to the restroom?

1:03:03.780 --> 1:03:05.239
Because I want to go too.

1:03:05.323 --> 1:03:07.033
I should get them new dishes.

1:03:10.411 --> 1:03:12.163
-That hurts.
-Of course it does.

1:03:12.955 --> 1:03:16.542
Weren't you aware of that
when you took the knife for her?

1:03:18.169 --> 1:03:20.588
The situation called for the action.

1:03:21.172 --> 1:03:25.510
Du-sik, you have feelings
for the dentist, don't you?

1:03:28.679 --> 1:03:31.015
Not this again.

1:03:31.098 --> 1:03:33.226
We're just friends.

1:03:34.393 --> 1:03:37.605
I turned 80 this year.

1:03:38.189 --> 1:03:43.986
All my life, I've been diving under water
fishing out abalones and sea urchins.

1:03:44.070 --> 1:03:48.825
I can now see through people
like I see through water.

1:03:50.535 --> 1:03:53.371
She has taken up
all the space in your heart,

1:03:53.454 --> 1:03:57.542
so why on earth are you fighting it?

1:03:59.252 --> 1:04:03.297
Du-sik, life may seem long,

1:04:03.381 --> 1:04:05.049
but it really isn't.

1:04:06.217 --> 1:04:09.011
Throw away unnecessary thoughts

1:04:09.929 --> 1:04:12.849
and be honest with yourself.

1:04:13.724 --> 1:04:14.684
Okay?

1:04:31.284 --> 1:04:32.994
HWAJEONG RAW FISH RESTAURANT

1:04:33.077 --> 1:04:34.078
Cho-hui!

1:04:43.254 --> 1:04:45.798
It's a little early for dinner,

1:04:46.465 --> 1:04:48.259
but it's better than having it late.

1:04:48.801 --> 1:04:51.637
I was hungry anyway. Thank you.

1:04:52.263 --> 1:04:54.056
I hope it's not too salty.

1:04:59.395 --> 1:05:00.563
It's perfect.

1:05:04.108 --> 1:05:08.738
I heard from the police
that you gave them a statement.

1:05:10.239 --> 1:05:11.240
Thank you.

1:05:11.824 --> 1:05:13.284
I'm so relieved he was caught.

1:05:13.367 --> 1:05:15.620
It could've been terrible
for you and Dr. Yoon.

1:05:16.203 --> 1:05:17.079
Right.

1:05:19.665 --> 1:05:21.334
So how have you been?

1:05:21.959 --> 1:05:26.047
How's your mother?
Didn't she suddenly collapse back then?

1:05:27.590 --> 1:05:29.675
She passed away last year.

1:05:31.010 --> 1:05:33.179
She needed help after collapsing,

1:05:33.846 --> 1:05:35.097
so I took care of her.

1:05:35.181 --> 1:05:39.810
Your mother must've tried very hard
to stay by her daughter's side longer.

1:05:40.645 --> 1:05:42.605
It must've been hard on you too.

1:05:44.398 --> 1:05:47.234
What about your brother?
Don't you have one?

1:05:47.777 --> 1:05:50.613
He emigrated to the US
about ten years ago.

1:05:51.572 --> 1:05:53.199
So it's just you.

1:05:54.617 --> 1:05:56.410
Loneliness must've drawn you back here.

1:06:08.381 --> 1:06:11.008
You used to love <i>seokbakji</i>.

1:06:12.093 --> 1:06:15.680
I still remember you devouring it
when you first rented our room.

1:06:15.763 --> 1:06:17.473
You remember that?

1:06:18.182 --> 1:06:20.309
It must be because
I value eating the most.

1:06:20.393 --> 1:06:22.728
I tend to remember
things related food well.

1:06:23.771 --> 1:06:26.774
Meanwhile, Yeong-guk
gets the blues every season,

1:06:26.857 --> 1:06:28.901
so no wonder he and I don't get along.

1:06:29.944 --> 1:06:31.112
Hwa-jeong,

1:06:31.988 --> 1:06:33.239
Yeong-guk and I--

1:06:33.322 --> 1:06:34.657
I heard.

1:06:35.574 --> 1:06:37.451
But what happened isn't your fault.

1:06:39.787 --> 1:06:41.038
Mom!

1:06:41.580 --> 1:06:44.125
Why keep the floor this slippery?

1:06:44.208 --> 1:06:45.626
Ms. Yu!

1:06:45.710 --> 1:06:46.711
Hi, I-jun.

1:06:46.794 --> 1:06:48.587
Hello.

1:06:48.671 --> 1:06:51.257
I-jun, did you have fun today?

1:06:52.425 --> 1:06:54.218
-Hey.
-Hey.

1:06:54.301 --> 1:06:55.720
Would you like some dinner too?

1:06:55.803 --> 1:06:59.890
No, I have urgent business
and should get going.

1:06:59.974 --> 1:07:01.058
Have fun.

1:07:05.938 --> 1:07:06.939
Gosh.

1:07:08.733 --> 1:07:09.984
It's fine.

1:07:10.818 --> 1:07:13.070
He won't die, so eat up.

1:07:19.910 --> 1:07:22.455
It sure is nice to be here.

1:07:22.538 --> 1:07:26.375
Now I know why everyone
wants an apartment by Han River.

1:07:28.127 --> 1:07:29.086
Is that so?

1:07:29.962 --> 1:07:31.756
What's with that dry response?

1:07:31.839 --> 1:07:33.591
Maybe I've been away for too long,

1:07:34.091 --> 1:07:37.011
but Han River is narrower than I remember.

1:07:38.304 --> 1:07:39.138
What?

1:07:40.222 --> 1:07:45.019
I mean, compared to the sea
I always look at in Gongjin.

1:07:45.895 --> 1:07:46.979
I see.

1:07:50.274 --> 1:07:52.777
We haven't had a course meal in ages.

1:07:53.444 --> 1:07:55.488
Gosh, this smell of butter.

1:07:56.489 --> 1:07:59.075
Hye-jin, we're having lobster.

1:07:59.158 --> 1:08:01.869
I love my life. I really do.

1:08:08.292 --> 1:08:09.251
Why are you giggling?

1:08:09.335 --> 1:08:13.422
Oh, it's just that the lobster
reminded me of something.

1:08:14.548 --> 1:08:18.094
Recently, I had red snow crabs
with Chief Hong

1:08:18.594 --> 1:08:22.556
and the crab meat got on his face
as I snapped the shell open.

1:08:23.682 --> 1:08:25.392
That was so funny.

1:08:25.476 --> 1:08:26.977
You haven't tried them, have you?

1:08:28.312 --> 1:08:30.981
They're much better
than imported lobsters.

1:08:31.065 --> 1:08:33.609
Maybe it's because
it was directly from Gongjin Harbor,

1:08:34.235 --> 1:08:36.529
but the crab meat was so sweet and soft.

1:08:37.238 --> 1:08:40.407
There wasn't any sauce,
but it was still delicious.

1:08:46.539 --> 1:08:48.541
-Hye-jin.
-Yes?

1:08:48.624 --> 1:08:49.792
You've been weird today.

1:08:51.293 --> 1:08:52.294
How so?

1:08:52.378 --> 1:08:53.754
You're not yourself.

1:08:54.338 --> 1:08:56.132
At the department store,

1:08:56.215 --> 1:08:58.884
though you acted like
you'd max out your credit card,

1:08:58.968 --> 1:09:01.387
you didn't buy any shoes or clothes.

1:09:01.470 --> 1:09:04.598
All you did was look at men's clothes.

1:09:04.682 --> 1:09:06.517
When did I ever--

1:09:06.600 --> 1:09:07.685
And even now,

1:09:07.768 --> 1:09:10.271
you keep talking about Gongjin

1:09:10.354 --> 1:09:12.064
as if all roads lead to it.

1:09:14.817 --> 1:09:15.734
Right.

1:09:16.777 --> 1:09:18.779
Why am I being a party pooper?

1:09:19.655 --> 1:09:20.489
You know what?

1:09:21.073 --> 1:09:23.325
In order to get
the Gongjin vibe out of me,

1:09:23.826 --> 1:09:25.911
we should go to a spa after this.

1:09:26.954 --> 1:09:28.664
Sure. Sounds good.

1:09:31.834 --> 1:09:34.545
It's so good. I absolutely love it.

1:09:39.133 --> 1:09:40.801
It's raining.

1:09:40.885 --> 1:09:42.887
The forecast never mentioned one.

1:09:43.679 --> 1:09:44.722
Maybe it's a shower.

1:09:45.347 --> 1:09:47.766
But we need to head to the parking lot.

1:09:47.850 --> 1:09:49.268
You have an umbrella, right?

1:09:49.351 --> 1:09:50.978
It's not far away, so let's run.

1:09:51.061 --> 1:09:51.896
What?

1:09:52.563 --> 1:09:54.982
Why do you keep acting weird?

1:09:55.608 --> 1:09:57.026
What do you mean?

1:09:57.109 --> 1:09:59.486
You hate getting wet in the rain.

1:09:59.570 --> 1:10:02.573
Feeling uncomfortable and damp
is your worst nightmare.

1:10:04.742 --> 1:10:07.244
<i>Are you nuts? I'm all drenched!</i>

1:10:07.328 --> 1:10:09.496
<i>So? Don't you feel refreshed?</i>

1:10:09.580 --> 1:10:12.958
No, I don't.
It feels uncomfortable and damp.

1:10:13.042 --> 1:10:15.711
So what?
Let your hair down and just feel it.

1:10:16.420 --> 1:10:18.923
<i>You're bound to meet
unexpected situations in life.</i>

1:10:19.006 --> 1:10:22.259
<i>Even if you use an umbrella,
you'll end up getting drenched.</i>

1:10:22.343 --> 1:10:25.387
Just put your hands up
and welcome the rain.

1:10:27.056 --> 1:10:29.892
Hye-jin, what's with you?

1:10:53.707 --> 1:10:55.084
Where'd you get this?

1:10:55.584 --> 1:10:57.127
On the street.

1:11:01.131 --> 1:11:03.008
-Are you okay?
-Chief Hong?

1:11:03.092 --> 1:11:04.093
So you're okay.

1:11:14.645 --> 1:11:15.813
It's so hot.

1:11:47.803 --> 1:11:49.805
I guess someone got the romance going.

1:11:50.389 --> 1:11:51.765
It's unnecessarily pretty.

1:11:54.018 --> 1:11:55.019
<i>Don't go.</i>

1:11:56.937 --> 1:11:58.147
Don't…

1:12:00.190 --> 1:12:01.317
leave me behind.

1:12:04.486 --> 1:12:05.696
Ms. Dentist?

1:12:18.125 --> 1:12:20.919
Ms. Dentist. Are you all right?

1:12:21.003 --> 1:12:23.422
Are you really okay? Did he hurt you?

1:12:23.505 --> 1:12:24.548
Hye-jin!

1:12:33.057 --> 1:12:34.767
What's the matter with you?

1:12:34.850 --> 1:12:39.355
You just ran out like some crazy woman,
and it's scaring me.

1:12:39.438 --> 1:12:42.441
And you happen to be in a floral dress.
It makes you look crazier!

1:12:42.524 --> 1:12:43.650
Mi-seon.

1:12:45.152 --> 1:12:46.904
I think I should go.

1:12:46.987 --> 1:12:48.322
Go where?

1:12:49.198 --> 1:12:50.324
To Gongjin.

1:12:50.407 --> 1:12:51.325
What?

1:12:51.825 --> 1:12:53.619
I'll call you later, okay?

1:12:57.706 --> 1:13:00.834
Yoon Hye-jin, that crazy wench!

1:13:06.173 --> 1:13:09.093
She finally came to a realization.

1:13:09.968 --> 1:13:11.929
Congratulations on the level-up.

1:13:12.721 --> 1:13:14.098
Way to go, my friend!

1:13:17.351 --> 1:13:20.062
What am I supposed to do now?

1:13:55.889 --> 1:13:57.141
Chief Hong.

1:13:59.476 --> 1:14:01.103
Chief Hong, are you home?

1:14:04.982 --> 1:14:07.985
MS. DENTIST

1:14:47.649 --> 1:14:48.567
Chief Hong!

1:14:50.819 --> 1:14:51.904
Chief Hong.

1:14:51.987 --> 1:14:52.988
Ms. Dentist?

1:14:55.741 --> 1:14:57.826
I thought you wouldn't be back
until tomorrow.

1:14:59.870 --> 1:15:02.456
I couldn't wait until tomorrow
to say this.

1:15:06.376 --> 1:15:07.461
I like you.

1:15:13.217 --> 1:15:14.718
I have feelings for you.

1:15:20.474 --> 1:15:23.977
I'm one of those people
who plan every second of their lives

1:15:24.728 --> 1:15:27.731
according to a lifespan of 99 years.

1:15:28.565 --> 1:15:31.443
I don't like people crossing the line
or crossing it myself.

1:15:32.110 --> 1:15:33.695
And I'm fond of expensive shoes.

1:15:34.947 --> 1:15:36.907
I guess I'm your complete opposite.

1:15:39.952 --> 1:15:42.538
It's the same with
our blood types and personalities.

1:15:42.621 --> 1:15:45.165
I bet we're not compatible in any aspect.

1:15:46.124 --> 1:15:48.877
We're probably as different as
penguins that eat krill

1:15:48.961 --> 1:15:52.798
and polar bears that feed on sea lions.

1:15:54.883 --> 1:15:57.761
But to hell with all of that…

1:16:00.222 --> 1:16:02.099
because I like you.

1:16:05.143 --> 1:16:06.395
Ms. Dentist, I--

1:16:08.230 --> 1:16:09.481
Don't say anything.

1:16:10.816 --> 1:16:13.193
I'm not asking anything from you.

1:16:13.694 --> 1:16:14.695
I…

1:16:15.279 --> 1:16:17.823
My feelings for you
keep inflating my heart,

1:16:19.157 --> 1:16:21.451
and it could burst at any second.

1:16:26.957 --> 1:16:28.584
I can't help it anymore.

1:17:12.836 --> 1:17:13.837
I…

1:17:16.590 --> 1:17:18.008
I can't…

1:17:19.301 --> 1:17:20.802
deny it anymore either.

1:17:53.710 --> 1:17:55.003
Do you like them?

1:17:55.671 --> 1:17:59.508
I love them! I'm going to
play soccer in these every day.

1:18:01.593 --> 1:18:03.553
Stop gawking at the shoes

1:18:03.637 --> 1:18:07.057
and blow out the candles on your cake.

1:18:07.599 --> 1:18:09.351
No, I have to make a wish first.

1:18:10.727 --> 1:18:14.314
Please let me and Grandpa
live a long and happy life together.

1:18:14.398 --> 1:18:17.943
Blow them out already
before the cake gets covered in wax.

1:18:21.071 --> 1:18:23.573
<i>I won't ask for much,</i>

1:18:24.074 --> 1:18:27.494
<i>so please grant this old man's wish.</i>

1:18:28.745 --> 1:18:32.457
<i>When Du-sik ends up all alone,</i>

1:18:33.834 --> 1:18:36.795
<i>please send him someone</i>

1:18:37.963 --> 1:18:39.756
<i>so that he won't be lonely.</i>

1:18:40.507 --> 1:18:45.303
<i>Please send him someone
who will be good for him.</i>

1:18:51.476 --> 1:18:53.895
All right. One,

1:18:54.688 --> 1:18:56.231
two…

1:18:58.275 --> 1:18:59.317
three!

1:19:02.362 --> 1:19:04.030
That little girl…

1:19:05.031 --> 1:19:06.450
was Ms. Dentist?

1:19:48.366 --> 1:19:50.911
<i>Can we hold off being a couple
for a few days?</i>

1:19:50.994 --> 1:19:53.663
<i>Are you having second thoughts
now that you have to dump him?</i>

1:19:53.747 --> 1:19:58.168
<i>I want time to sort out
the past I've had with Seong-hyeon</i>

1:19:58.251 --> 1:19:59.377
and the time I'll be spending with you.

1:19:59.461 --> 1:20:02.255
Hye-jin dumped me.
She says that she already likes someone.

1:20:02.339 --> 1:20:04.966
<i>Today's our first day as a couple, right?</i>

1:20:05.050 --> 1:20:06.802
<i>Were you always this physically oriented?</i>

1:20:06.885 --> 1:20:08.720
Why don't you lock
the front door from now on?

1:20:08.804 --> 1:20:10.430
Chief Hong!

1:20:10.514 --> 1:20:13.141
<i>I've lived for 34 years without you,</i>

1:20:13.225 --> 1:20:17.270
but each day seems
to last forever since I've met you.

1:20:17.354 --> 1:20:22.484
