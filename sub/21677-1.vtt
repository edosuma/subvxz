07:04.083 --> 07:05.042
- Nice to meet you.

07:05.083 --> 07:06.583
All right, Lauren, Trevor.

07:06.625 --> 07:08.125
- Hi, Trevor,
- nice to meet you... Lauren.

07:08.128 --> 07:09.291
- Senior deckhand.

07:09.292 --> 07:10.583
This is Kate.

07:10.625 --> 07:12.125
- Kate, Trevor,
- senior deckhand.

07:12.167 --> 07:13.625
- I'm Emily.
- Trevor, I'm senior deckhand.

07:13.628 --> 07:15.417
- I'm labeling your uniform.
- Thank you.

07:15.458 --> 07:17.434
- On a boat this size,
- usually I'd be the boatswain.

07:17.458 --> 07:18.917
You want to show me my bunk?

07:18.958 --> 07:20.558
- Yeah, you're gonna
- grab your clothes.

07:20.583 --> 07:22.375
- But I came on
- as senior deckhand

07:22.417 --> 07:23.976
- 'cause you take what comes
- at you and you run with it.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.292
- Which room am I?
- Port forward.

07:25.295 --> 07:27.042
- I don't consider myself
- a boss,

07:27.083 --> 07:28.726
- 'cause I've been
- in the lower person's shoes,

07:28.750 --> 07:30.559
- And I've worked my way up,
- so I understand that.

07:30.583 --> 07:32.783
- So if I had the choice of boss,
- it'd probably be me.

07:37.458 --> 07:39.083
- Wow, this place is nice.

07:40.792 --> 07:41.750
[knocking]

07:41.792 --> 07:42.958
- Ben.
- Hello.

07:42.961 --> 07:44.583
[laughter]

07:44.625 --> 07:46.333
- - The funny thing about
- this boat, "Valor,"

07:46.336 --> 07:47.646
Is, I actually worked on it

07:47.647 --> 07:48.958
12 years ago

07:49.000 --> 07:50.832
as a day worker.

07:50.833 --> 07:52.667
- And I just thought,
- how wonderful would it be

07:52.670 --> 07:54.666
To cook on a boat like this?

07:54.667 --> 07:55.958
- You check out your galley?

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
- Yeah, it's lovely,

07:57.001 --> 07:58.000
it's clean.

07:58.001 --> 07:59.375
Having just come back

07:59.376 --> 08:00.750
from the Mediterranean,

08:00.792 --> 08:02.313
it's really nice to work

08:02.314 --> 08:03.832
another season with Kate.

08:03.833 --> 08:04.833
- Oh, there she is.

08:04.834 --> 08:05.833
- Hi.

08:05.834 --> 08:07.833
- What's up?
- Nothing, how are you?

08:07.836 --> 08:09.167
- Good, how are you?
- Good.

08:09.170 --> 08:10.750
- We've been great friends,

08:10.792 --> 08:11.896
and we were a little more

08:11.897 --> 08:13.000
than that at one point.

08:13.042 --> 08:14.250
- Getting the tour?
- Yeah.

08:14.292 --> 08:15.458
Both: Nice.

08:15.500 --> 08:16.833
- But sometimes that does

08:16.875 --> 08:18.354
complicate

08:18.355 --> 08:19.832
our working relationship.

08:19.833 --> 08:20.833
This is a proper boat.

08:20.834 --> 08:21.834
- Yes.

08:24.875 --> 08:26.500
- Whoa.
- I see weights.

08:26.542 --> 08:27.542
- They're like 5 pounds.

08:27.543 --> 08:28.543
- Not enough.

08:28.583 --> 08:30.063
So do you have anybody special

08:30.064 --> 08:31.542
in your life right now?

08:31.583 --> 08:33.207
- Yeah, I am
- dating somebody.

08:33.211 --> 08:34.332
- Who?

08:34.375 --> 08:35.957
- I just met her.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.957
- Ooh, a her, huh?

08:38.000 --> 08:39.020
- Yeah, it's new.

08:39.022 --> 08:40.042
- That's awesome.

08:40.082 --> 08:42.042
- [chuckles]
- I was not expecting that.

08:42.044 --> 08:43.226
- You know,
- it really doesn't matter,

08:43.250 --> 08:44.833
As long as it makes you happy.

08:44.875 --> 08:46.333
- So my girlfriend's name is Ro.

08:46.375 --> 08:47.893
- She's, like,
- a professional athlete.

08:47.917 --> 08:49.667
She wears combat boots.

08:49.708 --> 08:51.375
- I think it shows
- how great she is,

08:51.378 --> 08:52.625
To make me attracted to a girl,

08:52.626 --> 08:53.874
'cause I never was.

08:53.875 --> 08:54.958
Am I gay, am I not gay?

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
I don't know.

08:56.042 --> 08:57.667
I am in sexual limbo,

08:57.708 --> 08:59.521
and not like in a fun

08:59.522 --> 09:01.333
"Kama Sutra page 96" way,

09:01.375 --> 09:02.792
intermediate level

09:02.793 --> 09:04.207
sexual limbo.

09:04.208 --> 09:06.207
It's complicated.

09:06.208 --> 09:07.374
It's crazy.

09:07.375 --> 09:08.709
- That's cool.

09:08.710 --> 09:10.042
- Yeah.

09:10.083 --> 09:11.726
- So how's it going?
- How's it going, Nico?

09:11.750 --> 09:12.893
- Trevor.
- Good to meet you, man.

09:12.917 --> 09:14.583
- Senior deckhand.
- Thank you.

09:14.586 --> 09:16.601
- So, guys, Trevor's gonna be
- the senior deckhand,

09:16.625 --> 09:18.893
- So what he says goes, 'cause
- it's probably coming from me.

09:18.917 --> 09:20.375
- Just because we are
- higher-ups,

09:20.417 --> 09:21.851
- Feel free to bounce
- things off of us.

09:21.875 --> 09:23.226
- I mean, we don't
- know everything.

09:23.250 --> 09:24.916
- Higher-up, okay, that's fine.

09:24.917 --> 09:26.313
I worked on a 223-foot

09:26.314 --> 09:27.708
super-yacht with 17 crew.

09:27.750 --> 09:28.979
So I think I know

09:28.980 --> 09:30.208
what higher-up means.

09:30.250 --> 09:32.226
- If he doesn't know exactly
- what he thinks about it,

09:32.250 --> 09:34.226
- He'll bounce it off me,
- and we'll make a decision.

09:34.250 --> 09:35.916
Smarter, not harder.

09:35.917 --> 09:37.351
- "Hey, I'm Trevor,
- I'm the senior deckhand."

09:37.375 --> 09:38.583
- My one rule is,

09:38.625 --> 09:40.018
- don't f... around
- with the guests.

09:40.042 --> 09:41.416
We're here to serve them.

09:41.417 --> 09:42.750
- We're not here
- to party with them.

09:42.753 --> 09:44.417
- We're not their friends.
- Yeah.

09:44.458 --> 09:46.083
- If I catch you kissing a guest
- or something like that,

09:46.086 --> 09:47.893
- I'm gonna have you gone
- as quick as possible.

09:47.917 --> 09:49.893
- Trevor's been a boatswain.
- He's been a first mate

09:49.917 --> 09:51.105
On a smaller yacht; Nico

09:51.106 --> 09:52.292
and Lauren are experienced.

09:52.333 --> 09:54.813
- And it looks like I'm gonna have
- a pretty strong deck crew.

09:56.958 --> 09:58.291
- Let's just tone it down a bit.

09:58.292 --> 09:59.772
- I don't know what
- you think of us.

10:02.458 --> 10:03.792
- I mean, the guests
- are coming tomorrow.

10:03.795 --> 10:05.291
I've got so much to do.

10:05.292 --> 10:07.125
- Do you want us to be
- going around and doing...

10:07.128 --> 10:09.088
- Gonna be doing, like,
- hot shots with the boat?

10:13.958 --> 10:14.917
That's a great name.

10:14.958 --> 10:16.457
- I love that surname.

10:16.458 --> 10:17.625
- Sierra Storm,
- sounds like a super hero.

10:17.628 --> 10:19.124
- That's amazing.

10:19.125 --> 10:20.958
- Attention all crew,
- we got provisions now.

10:20.961 --> 10:22.768
- So let's get everybody
- out there to load it up.

10:22.792 --> 10:24.458
- How heavy is it?
- It's pretty heavy.

10:24.461 --> 10:26.124
- Oh, it is heavy.

10:26.125 --> 10:27.625
- You can definitely
- handle this one.

10:27.628 --> 10:28.792
- Oh, yeah.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.375
- I love your company

10:36.376 --> 10:37.750
so much.

10:40.667 --> 10:42.166
- And you see the soft-shell?

10:42.167 --> 10:43.833
- Oh, good, I love
- soft-shell crab, do you?

10:43.836 --> 10:45.000
- Oh, absolutely.

10:45.042 --> 10:46.833
- Is that Ben's voice I hear?

10:46.875 --> 10:48.125
- Hey.
- What's going on?

10:48.167 --> 10:49.625
- How's it going?
- Very good.

10:49.667 --> 10:50.999
How are you?

10:51.000 --> 10:52.833
- Oh, looks like you got
- plenty of food in there.

10:52.836 --> 10:54.500
- So you're in charge this year,
- are you?

10:54.503 --> 10:55.667
- Yeah.

10:55.708 --> 10:57.125
- Wow, Kelley is the boatswain.

10:57.167 --> 10:58.833
Good luck, champ.

10:58.875 --> 11:00.684
- Well, that's good.
- It's a little terrifying.

11:00.708 --> 11:02.958
- It's probably more terrifying
- for them, I'd imagine.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.583
[laughter]

11:08.167 --> 11:09.167
- So do we have everyone?

11:09.168 --> 11:10.167
Did your other stew come?

11:10.168 --> 11:11.500
- Not yet.
- Not yet, oh, okay.

11:11.542 --> 11:12.833
- I'll have to check
- with the captain.

11:12.836 --> 11:14.500
- We could use her help,
- for sure.

11:16.542 --> 11:18.184
- Do you know what time
- my third stew's arriving?

11:18.208 --> 11:20.667
- No, no, I don't.

11:20.708 --> 11:22.292
- This is not good.

11:22.333 --> 11:24.143
- With less than 24 hours
- before charter guests arrive,

11:24.167 --> 11:25.541
There is so much to do.

11:25.542 --> 11:27.167
- But I will look into that.

11:27.208 --> 11:29.374
- It's just a lot of work.

11:29.375 --> 11:31.374
Sh...

11:31.375 --> 11:32.375
- Nico, I saw you trying

11:32.376 --> 11:33.375
to take the top bunk.

11:33.376 --> 11:35.041
Sorry, I took the top bunk.

11:35.042 --> 11:36.188
I know you're tall,

11:36.189 --> 11:37.333
but I'm senior deckhand.

11:41.625 --> 11:42.625
- Let's get smashing.

11:43.708 --> 11:45.208
- Where you from
- originally, Trevor?

11:45.211 --> 11:46.542
- Born in Atlanta,

11:46.583 --> 11:48.184
- but Pensacola Beach, Florida,
- is home.

11:48.208 --> 11:49.333
I've been around the world.

11:49.375 --> 11:50.875
I've been a competitive surfer.

11:50.917 --> 11:52.667
- Been a hair model
- for Paul Mitchell.

11:52.708 --> 11:54.021
Did 100-ton captain's lessons

11:54.022 --> 11:55.333
and engineering courses.

11:55.375 --> 11:56.709
I've worked in yachting

11:56.710 --> 11:58.042
for about 3 1/2 years.

11:58.083 --> 11:59.875
- I was a boatswain
- of a 164-foot,

11:59.917 --> 12:01.333
Had three deckhands under me.

12:01.375 --> 12:02.479
I was also first mate

12:02.480 --> 12:03.583
of a 130-foot.

12:03.625 --> 12:05.934
- Just continue minding your line;
- never forget about that.

12:05.958 --> 12:07.729
So, yeah, I mean,

12:07.730 --> 12:09.500
I know my boat sh...

12:09.542 --> 12:10.708
Whoo.

12:12.583 --> 12:14.250
- Hello, nice to meet you.
- Hello, how are you?

12:14.253 --> 12:15.559
- I'm Emily.
- Where are you from?

12:15.583 --> 12:16.542
- The U.K.
- Yeah, so am I.

12:16.583 --> 12:17.917
- You're British?

12:17.958 --> 12:19.542
- Yeah, where you from?
- London.

12:19.583 --> 12:20.750
I've been yachting

12:20.751 --> 12:21.916
for the last 2 1/2 years.

12:21.917 --> 12:22.917
I've cruised across

12:22.918 --> 12:23.917
the whole of the Med,

12:23.918 --> 12:25.416
the Caribbean.

12:25.417 --> 12:27.542
- So you spent all your time
- in London, did you?

12:27.583 --> 12:28.667
- I went to boarding school

12:28.668 --> 12:29.749
in Sussex.

12:29.750 --> 12:31.167
- Okay, which one?

12:31.208 --> 12:32.500
- Eastbourne College.

12:32.542 --> 12:33.542
- I went to Bradfield.

12:33.583 --> 12:35.167
- I was very much into academia,

12:35.208 --> 12:36.750
- and I was going to go
- to Cambridge

12:36.792 --> 12:37.792
To study psychology

12:37.793 --> 12:38.792
and politics,

12:38.793 --> 12:40.375
- but I wanted a bit more
- out of life.

12:40.417 --> 12:41.875
And I love adventure.

12:41.917 --> 12:43.458
- I'm only 21;
- you only live once.

12:43.461 --> 12:44.708
And it is the time of life

12:44.709 --> 12:45.958
to experience things

12:46.000 --> 12:47.625
- that you're not able
- to do later on

12:47.667 --> 12:49.292
- When you want to settle down,
- maybe.

12:49.295 --> 12:50.625
- Attention all crew.

12:50.667 --> 12:51.730
I need everybody

12:51.731 --> 12:52.792
in the main salon.

12:52.833 --> 12:54.208
- Copy.

12:54.250 --> 12:56.125
- Deck crew,
- here's your response.

12:56.167 --> 12:59.292
[indistinct chatter]

12:59.333 --> 13:00.708
- Okay.

13:00.750 --> 13:01.979
The first thing

13:01.980 --> 13:03.208
I want to go over is,

13:03.250 --> 13:05.457
your stew never made the plane.

13:05.458 --> 13:06.791
- Okay.

13:06.792 --> 13:09.125
- So we're short.

13:09.167 --> 13:10.417
- Sh...

13:10.458 --> 13:11.601
- If you need me,
- I'll help.

13:11.625 --> 13:12.583
- I know, thank you.

13:12.625 --> 13:13.958
- Guests arrive tomorrow.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.229
For those of you who

13:15.230 --> 13:16.457
don't know how I run a boat,

13:16.458 --> 13:17.957
it's pretty simple.

13:17.958 --> 13:19.146
You do your job.

13:19.147 --> 13:20.332
You don't embarrass yourself.

13:20.333 --> 13:22.292
- And you don't
- embarrass the boat.

13:22.333 --> 13:23.667
We're not having cocktails

13:23.668 --> 13:24.999
while we're on charter.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.417
Follow those three rules, and

13:26.418 --> 13:27.832
we're gonna get along just fine.

13:27.833 --> 13:29.976
- Obviously none of us want
- to screw up for Captain Lee.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.500
- You know, he's got
- high standards,

13:31.542 --> 13:33.167
- But we have our basics,
- which is, as long as

13:33.170 --> 13:34.809
- The job's done,
- you can do what you want.

13:34.833 --> 13:36.583
- Just, you know,
- don't be a dick-head.

13:36.625 --> 13:37.875
- I always walk around with

13:37.876 --> 13:39.125
some cash and plane tickets,

13:39.167 --> 13:40.917
- but I'd like to set
- a record this year

13:40.958 --> 13:42.313
For just keeping

13:42.314 --> 13:43.667
one whole crew intact.

13:43.708 --> 13:45.188
Barry and Larry is our

13:45.189 --> 13:46.667
1st officer and chief engineer.

13:46.708 --> 13:48.500
- I expect you
- to cooperate with them

13:48.542 --> 13:50.458
- As much as you cooperate
- with me.

13:50.500 --> 13:52.084
We'll all make lots of money,

13:52.085 --> 13:53.666
and things go a lot smoother.

13:53.667 --> 13:55.292
Carry on, we're good.

13:57.500 --> 13:59.351
- So how are you going
- with the shirts down there?

13:59.375 --> 14:00.874
- I'm ironing all of them?

14:00.875 --> 14:02.226
- I like ironing
- all of them before.

14:02.250 --> 14:03.875
- I don't want to have
- a mad dash.

14:03.878 --> 14:05.351
- So we know what we have
- to get done

14:05.375 --> 14:06.851
- Now that we have
- one less set of hands.

14:06.875 --> 14:08.476
- I think Emily's gonna be
- a great second stew.

14:08.500 --> 14:10.125
- Okay, great.
- Yay.

14:10.167 --> 14:11.896
- She seems experienced, sweet,

14:11.897 --> 14:13.625
confident... I love her.

14:13.667 --> 14:15.041
She's adorable.

14:15.042 --> 14:16.542
- Yeah, she's English,
- that's why.

14:16.583 --> 14:18.292
- Nico, girlfriend back home?

14:18.333 --> 14:19.541
- Kind of with someone,

14:19.542 --> 14:21.059
- but we just recently
- started talking.

14:21.083 --> 14:22.875
- Oh, so it's just fresh.
- Yeah.

14:22.878 --> 14:24.375
- So you're talking to someone
- but not dating someone.

14:24.378 --> 14:25.667
- Yeah, what about you guys?

14:25.708 --> 14:26.726
- Oh, I'm single as can be.

14:26.750 --> 14:28.292
- Single and ready to mingle?

14:28.333 --> 14:29.875
- Yeah.
- What about you there, Lauren?

14:29.878 --> 14:31.833
- I'd say probably single
- as a Pringle.

14:31.875 --> 14:33.458
Let's put it that way.

14:33.500 --> 14:35.542
- Ooh, that's good;
- Pringles are f... ing delicious,

14:35.545 --> 14:36.875
- By the way.
- They're great.

14:36.878 --> 14:38.542
- Eye-candy-wise,
- Nico and Kelley,

14:38.545 --> 14:40.184
- You know, they're both cute
- and flirty.

14:40.208 --> 14:41.643
- I mean, it's nice to work
- with someone

14:41.667 --> 14:43.083
- That's good to look at,
- you know?

14:43.086 --> 14:45.083
- Once you pop,
- you can't stop, eh?

14:45.086 --> 14:46.582
- [laughs]

14:46.583 --> 14:48.542
- - Ben, Kate, Kelley,
- I need you guys

14:48.583 --> 14:50.183
- Down in the crew mess
- in five minutes

14:50.208 --> 14:51.583
For prepping meeting.

14:51.625 --> 14:53.042
- Copy.

14:54.458 --> 14:56.000
- First one,

14:56.001 --> 14:57.542
we have eight ladies.

14:57.583 --> 14:59.167
Our primary, Allison,

14:59.208 --> 15:00.917
- she owns
- her own clothing line.

15:00.958 --> 15:02.708
- Apparently she's
- Instagram friends

15:02.750 --> 15:04.833
- With all of the other girls
- that are involved,

15:04.875 --> 15:06.583
But they've never, ever met.

15:06.625 --> 15:08.021
- If you meet your friends

15:08.022 --> 15:09.417
on Instagram,

15:09.458 --> 15:10.729
you never say

15:10.730 --> 15:12.000
you met on Instagram.

15:12.042 --> 15:13.708
- Whoa, she's hot.
- Wow.

15:13.750 --> 15:15.601
- It says they want
- a beach picnic, by the way.

15:15.625 --> 15:17.438
- And they want a theme party

15:17.439 --> 15:19.249
based on social media.

15:19.250 --> 15:20.334
- Each meal,

15:20.335 --> 15:21.416
they could like or dislike.

15:21.417 --> 15:23.416
- I don't know about that.

15:23.417 --> 15:24.646
- Carley Faircloth

15:24.647 --> 15:25.875
loves escargot.

15:25.917 --> 15:27.875
The primary hates escargot.

15:27.917 --> 15:29.271
- Someone doesn't like seafood,

15:29.272 --> 15:30.625
others do like seafood,

15:30.667 --> 15:31.730
which makes it, you know,

15:31.731 --> 15:32.791
a little difficult

15:32.792 --> 15:34.624
if you're the chef.

15:34.625 --> 15:36.226
- I don't think they could
- actually agree

15:36.250 --> 15:38.125
On one single plate.

15:38.167 --> 15:40.417
Hashtag "effing nightmare."

15:40.458 --> 15:41.893
- I'm gonna follow her
- on Instagram

15:41.917 --> 15:43.292
- So I can go
- on her next yacht trip.

15:43.295 --> 15:44.458
- Okay.

15:44.500 --> 15:45.893
- Become virtual friends
- with her?

15:45.917 --> 15:47.624
- Like it all, yeah.

15:47.625 --> 15:49.792
- Where you guys at back here?
- We're just drying now.

15:49.795 --> 15:50.875
- Do y'all need brushes,

15:50.876 --> 15:51.957
just need blades?

15:51.958 --> 15:53.625
- You don't need hoses
- anymore or anything?

15:53.628 --> 15:55.601
- No, that's the only one
- we need, right there...

15:55.625 --> 15:57.934
- Just make sure, when you're
- done with any hose, drain it.

15:57.958 --> 16:00.083
- So, Lauren, have you ever
- worked on a boat before?

16:00.125 --> 16:01.875
- Well, I have, actually.

16:01.917 --> 16:03.542
- Well, just in case
- you didn't know,

16:03.583 --> 16:05.375
- I'm gonna tell you
- how to do everything.

16:05.417 --> 16:06.771
- Please, do.

16:06.772 --> 16:08.125
[laughs]

16:08.167 --> 16:09.625
- So how are you feeling?

16:09.667 --> 16:12.166
- I'm mentally preparing for it.

16:12.167 --> 16:14.167
- Yeah, tomorrow, one of us
- will go down vacuuming,

16:14.170 --> 16:15.833
- And then we have to fold
- toilet paper and stuff.

16:15.836 --> 16:17.434
- Yeah, how would you
- like the fold done?

16:17.458 --> 16:19.167
- Diamond with a fan.
- Okay, yeah.

16:19.208 --> 16:20.417
- So are you dating anybody?

16:20.458 --> 16:21.917
- No, I've just...

16:21.958 --> 16:23.851
- On my previous boat,
- I was in a relationship,

16:23.875 --> 16:25.583
But they're over now.

16:25.625 --> 16:27.292
- Are you dating anyone
- at the moment?

16:27.333 --> 16:28.667
- I actually am.

16:28.708 --> 16:30.268
- Just only, like,
- a month and a half.

16:30.292 --> 16:32.000
- So we're just in that
- really happy phase.

16:32.003 --> 16:33.333
- How did you meet?

16:33.375 --> 16:34.500
- A bar in my hometown.

16:34.542 --> 16:36.500
- I had just come back
- to the town.

16:36.542 --> 16:37.605
She had just come back

16:37.606 --> 16:38.667
to the town.

16:38.708 --> 16:40.000
- Oh, it's a she.

16:40.042 --> 16:41.667
- Yeah.
- Oh, wow.

16:41.708 --> 16:43.188
- Yeah, it's my first time

16:43.189 --> 16:44.666
dating a girl, actually.

16:44.667 --> 16:46.833
- At first, I was like, I really
- like hanging out with her,

16:46.836 --> 16:48.518
- But I don't want to give her
- the wrong idea

16:48.542 --> 16:49.875
'cause I'm not a lesbian.

16:49.917 --> 16:51.875
- But then, one night,
- I kissed her.

16:51.917 --> 16:53.375
- I don't know
- where it came from.

16:53.417 --> 16:55.292
- She just seems like
- a really cool person.

16:55.333 --> 16:56.726
- I don't know
- how to describe it.

16:56.750 --> 16:58.375
- It's like, I was never
- in the closet.

16:58.378 --> 17:00.184
- I just kind of went
- in the closet for a second,

17:00.208 --> 17:01.208
Picked out a new outfit,

17:01.209 --> 17:02.209
and came right back out.

17:02.250 --> 17:04.351
- But you've never felt
- attracted to girls until now?

17:04.375 --> 17:06.166
- No, no, never.

17:06.208 --> 17:07.791
- All crew, dinner is ready.

17:07.833 --> 17:08.916
- Oh, this looks awesome.

17:08.917 --> 17:10.000
- It smells awesome.

17:10.041 --> 17:11.291
- Mmm!

17:11.333 --> 17:12.833
- How was your day?
- Pretty busy?

17:14.916 --> 17:16.375
- A lot of exterior
- on this boat.

17:16.416 --> 17:17.791
- Yeah, especially
- for this size.

17:17.833 --> 17:19.541
- My old boat was
- a lot bigger than this,

17:19.545 --> 17:20.750
And we only had five outside.

17:22.666 --> 17:24.041
- How big
- was your last boat?

17:24.045 --> 17:25.374
- Uh, 67 meters.

17:25.375 --> 17:27.041
- That's big.
- That's big.

17:27.045 --> 17:28.893
- Nico, I saw you trying
- to take the top bunk.

17:28.917 --> 17:30.625
Sorry, I took the top bunk.

17:38.625 --> 17:40.250
- I went in there,
- I was like, "No way."

17:40.253 --> 17:42.250
- I know you're tall,
- but I'm the senior deckhand.

17:42.253 --> 17:44.167
- [laughs]

17:44.208 --> 17:45.351
- Are you serious right now?

17:45.375 --> 17:46.542
Bad start.

17:48.708 --> 17:50.292
All right, my coffin,

17:50.293 --> 17:51.875
here I go.

17:53.375 --> 17:54.458
- Good night.
- Good night.

17:56.542 --> 17:58.083
- What's up, big guy?

17:58.125 --> 17:59.542
- Oh. F...

18:08.458 --> 18:10.082
- That is f... ed up.

18:10.083 --> 18:11.771
- So how are you feeling

18:11.772 --> 18:13.458
about our two-stew adventure?

18:13.500 --> 18:15.125
- We're just not gonna stop.

18:15.167 --> 18:16.792
- - The fact that Emily
- is not freaking out

18:16.795 --> 18:18.291
About not having a third stew

18:18.292 --> 18:19.459
proves to me that she knows,

18:19.460 --> 18:20.624
in yachting,

18:20.625 --> 18:21.709
things happen

18:21.710 --> 18:22.792
you can't control,

18:22.833 --> 18:24.625
- and all you can do
- is move forward.

18:24.628 --> 18:26.625
- I'm just gonna need you
- to be my right hand.

18:26.667 --> 18:28.124
Like, I trust your judgment.

18:28.125 --> 18:29.625
- I can tell you know
- what you're doing.

18:29.628 --> 18:30.791
- What's your Instagram name?

18:30.792 --> 18:32.708
- The World Wanderer.

18:32.750 --> 18:34.291
Sounds majestic, doesn't it?

18:34.292 --> 18:35.292
Hashtag "awesome."

18:35.293 --> 18:36.875
- Attention all crew,

18:36.917 --> 18:38.726
- charter guests
- will be arriving in one hour.

18:38.750 --> 18:40.021
- Where's the spinach?

18:40.022 --> 18:41.291
What's this?

18:41.292 --> 18:43.750
- I can't deal with these
- provisions arriving the day of.

18:43.792 --> 18:45.458
- I don't have
- any of my sh... yet.

18:45.461 --> 18:46.938
- What are you missing?

18:46.939 --> 18:48.417
- Four pounds of spinach.

18:48.458 --> 18:49.583
Favorite: spinach smoothie.

18:49.584 --> 18:50.708
- That's her favorite.

18:50.750 --> 18:51.750
But it's not her only.

18:51.751 --> 18:52.751
- Doesn't matter, babe.

18:52.792 --> 18:54.518
- I ordered four pounds
- of f... ing spinach...

18:54.542 --> 18:56.167
- Okay, Popeye,
- get your spinach.

18:56.208 --> 18:57.833
- They charged us for it,
- and it didn't show up.

18:57.836 --> 18:59.268
- - Kate, Kate,
- we got provisions on the dock.

18:59.292 --> 19:01.000
- Do we have any spinach
- in here?

19:01.042 --> 19:02.792
- Perfect.

19:02.833 --> 19:04.167
It's all here, it's all here.

19:04.208 --> 19:05.313
- All right, good.

19:05.314 --> 19:06.417
- Yay, spinach.

19:06.458 --> 19:08.000
- Sorry if I'm freaking out,

19:08.042 --> 19:09.458
but it's f... ing hot in here,

19:09.500 --> 19:11.417
- and the guests are arriving
- in an hour,

19:11.458 --> 19:13.313
And my f... ing galley

19:13.314 --> 19:15.166
is filled with sh...

19:15.167 --> 19:16.167

19:16.168 --> 19:17.167
very temperamental,

19:17.168 --> 19:19.625
in case you haven't noticed.

19:19.667 --> 19:22.000
- - Attention all crew, I need
- everybody on the aft deck

19:22.003 --> 19:23.332
In five minutes.

19:23.333 --> 19:24.832
Five minutes.

19:24.833 --> 19:26.000
- Hey, Kate.
- Yeah?

19:26.003 --> 19:27.500
- No ties, right?
- No.

19:30.333 --> 19:31.708
- You guys can lead the way.

19:31.709 --> 19:33.083
It's all good.

19:33.125 --> 19:34.708
I'm so excited!

- Who is this?

19:43.083 --> 19:44.874
Is this our stew?

19:44.875 --> 19:46.917
- She'll be working double time
- to make up for it.

19:52.542 --> 19:53.875
- Hello, there.
- Hi!

19:55.208 --> 19:56.393
- Welcome aboard.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.625
- Pleasure, Allison.
- Hi, welcome.

19:59.667 --> 20:00.688
No amount of planning

20:00.689 --> 20:01.707
or grocery shopping

20:01.708 --> 20:03.167
- will ever get rid
- of the anxiety

20:03.208 --> 20:04.976
- Of when the guests
- are walking on the boat.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.333
- Hi.

20:06.375 --> 20:07.975
- They go from being
- complete strangers

20:08.000 --> 20:09.809
- To the center of your universe
- in about three seconds.

20:09.833 --> 20:11.375
- Kelley.
- Kelsey, nice to meet you.

20:11.417 --> 20:12.833
- Oh, Kelsey.

20:12.875 --> 20:15.042
Ooh, sh...

20:15.083 --> 20:16.542
I'm in trouble.

- Ladies,

20:18.250 --> 20:19.583
- Thank you.

20:19.586 --> 20:21.542
- Kate is gonna show you

20:21.583 --> 20:23.101
- Ladies, if you're ready
- to go inside.

20:23.125 --> 20:24.500
- Sure. Sure.
- Thank you, Kate.

20:24.542 --> 20:25.768

- Oh, it's so nice.

20:25.792 --> 20:27.042
Ooh.

20:27.083 --> 20:28.351
- This is so pretty.
- Beautiful.

20:28.375 --> 20:29.708
- So this is our main salon.

20:29.750 --> 20:31.667
- I'm gonna be hanging
- in here all day.

20:31.708 --> 20:33.250
- Oh, my God,
- look at the wine rack.

20:33.253 --> 20:34.708
- I think it's everything
- I listed.

20:34.750 --> 20:36.167
- So, Allison,
- this is your room.

20:36.208 --> 20:38.083
- Oh, my God.
- It's not big enough.

20:38.086 --> 20:39.559
- It's not big enough.
- [woman screams]

20:39.583 --> 20:40.934
- I'll sleep in here!
- It's amazing.

20:40.958 --> 20:41.917
- Gorgeous.
- Oh, my God.

20:41.958 --> 20:43.749
- Your bathroom?

20:43.750 --> 20:45.250
Look at the bathtub!

20:45.251 --> 20:46.749
- Holy sh...

20:46.750 --> 20:48.184
- I mean, your toilet
- sings to you.

20:48.208 --> 20:49.768
- Oh, my God,
- I have this in my house.

20:49.792 --> 20:51.226
- Oh, you know how
- to use it, then.

20:51.250 --> 20:52.750
- Kate, you're my hero.

20:52.792 --> 20:53.875
- Oh, awesome.

20:53.917 --> 20:56.000
- [grunting]

20:56.042 --> 20:57.583
- There's bodies
- in all these bags.

20:57.625 --> 20:59.292
[laughter]

20:59.333 --> 21:01.292
- It's gorgeous.
- It's so clean and bright.

21:01.333 --> 21:02.726
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, this is so nice.

21:02.750 --> 21:03.917
- This is so nice.

21:05.417 --> 21:07.208
- Hey, Trevor.

21:07.250 --> 21:08.958
- I'm sweating
- like a whore in church.

21:08.961 --> 21:10.167
You should see me

21:10.168 --> 21:11.375
when I played college soccer.

21:11.417 --> 21:12.417
I was, like, drenched.

21:12.458 --> 21:13.624
- Gross.

21:13.625 --> 21:15.708
- The very top is the fun level.

21:15.750 --> 21:18.059
- - Someone's gonna go tits-up on
- these stairs, I just know it.

21:18.083 --> 21:19.458
- So there's a great
- Jacuzzi tub.

21:19.500 --> 21:20.958
- Oh, my God.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.726
- And then we have what we call
- the bunny pad,

21:22.750 --> 21:24.143
- Where you all can lay out,
- get sun.

21:24.167 --> 21:25.958
- Oh, sh...
- It's amazing.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.417
- Should we... swimsuit?
- Yes.

21:27.458 --> 21:28.458
- So hungry.

21:30.792 --> 21:32.125
- That was just a welcome drink.

21:32.167 --> 21:33.791
We also have rosé, champagne.

21:33.792 --> 21:34.958
What do you really want?

21:35.000 --> 21:36.021
- Chardonnay.

21:36.022 --> 21:37.042
- No chardonnay.

21:37.083 --> 21:38.457
- I'm down with the rosé.

21:38.458 --> 21:40.000
- Tequila soda.
- Club soda.

21:40.042 --> 21:41.271
- Three rosés, a club soda,

21:41.272 --> 21:42.500
and a tequila soda.

21:42.542 --> 21:43.646
- That one goes left.

21:43.647 --> 21:44.750
- To the left.

21:44.792 --> 21:46.999
- This one... no, no, left.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.832
- Okay, deck crew,

21:48.833 --> 21:50.833
- go ahead and change over
- to white shorts and polos.

21:50.836 --> 21:52.250
- Nice, I'm drenched.

21:52.292 --> 21:53.250
- Let's go put
- our bathing suits on.

21:53.292 --> 21:54.500
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

21:55.875 --> 21:57.458
- Ow.

21:57.500 --> 21:58.729
- This is, like, not a boat.

21:58.730 --> 21:59.958
[laughs]

22:00.000 --> 22:01.601
- - Kelley, I need you
- to get the deck crew

22:01.625 --> 22:03.333
- In position, please.
- - Roger that.

22:03.375 --> 22:05.333
- I'm really self-conscious
- of that, wearing blue underwear.

22:05.336 --> 22:06.500
Can you see them?

22:06.501 --> 22:07.666
- No.

22:07.667 --> 22:08.832
- [chuckles]

22:08.833 --> 22:11.625
- All right, let's go.

22:11.667 --> 22:13.292
- Nico, let us know...

22:13.293 --> 22:14.917
[indistinct]

22:14.958 --> 22:16.104
- Okay, stern line's clear,

22:16.105 --> 22:17.250
stern line's clear.

22:20.708 --> 22:22.375
- Hi.
- This is the tequila.

22:22.378 --> 22:23.604
- Thank you.

22:23.605 --> 22:24.833
- Oh, thank you.

22:24.875 --> 22:26.792
[indistinct radio chatter]

22:26.833 --> 22:28.458
- Sweet, you're good.
- Talking to me?

22:28.500 --> 22:30.000
- To all of us.

22:30.042 --> 22:31.559
- First time off the dock
- in Tortola,

22:31.583 --> 22:33.226
- Lauren and Nico
- are where they need to be.

22:33.250 --> 22:35.208
Trevor did a good job.

22:35.250 --> 22:36.938
That offsets his annoying

22:36.939 --> 22:38.625
behavior just a little bit.

22:38.667 --> 22:39.833
Perfect.

22:39.875 --> 22:41.333
- Will you go down
- to the twin room

22:41.375 --> 22:42.707
And unpack both of them?

22:42.708 --> 22:44.000
Thank you.

22:44.042 --> 22:45.518
- How do you get service
- on your phone?

22:45.542 --> 22:46.542
- Do airplane mode

22:46.543 --> 22:47.543
and then Wi-Fi.

22:47.583 --> 22:48.625
- [laughing]

22:51.375 --> 22:52.708
- Thank you very much.

22:52.750 --> 22:54.542
- I would love a glass
- of rosé with ice.

22:54.545 --> 22:56.393
- I remind you of your roommate
- in rehab? That's awesome.

22:56.417 --> 22:58.625
- Hey, Ben, have lunch ready
- in, like, 15 minutes?

22:58.667 --> 23:00.375
- Um...
- Does that sound okay?

23:00.378 --> 23:02.309
- Yeah, I'll put the things
- in the oven right now,

23:02.333 --> 23:03.333
And we'll be rocking

23:03.334 --> 23:04.334
and rolling.

23:04.375 --> 23:06.351
- Hey, Trevor, what are
- we doing with those whips?

23:06.375 --> 23:08.059
- Hey, will you wrap this fender
- around this pilot

23:08.083 --> 23:10.184
- Before it catches wind?
- Quick, quick, quick, go, go.

23:10.208 --> 23:11.917
- When I'm on deck,
- I got one speed,

23:11.920 --> 23:13.083
And that's full speed.

23:13.125 --> 23:15.083
Meet me on sun deck aft.

23:15.125 --> 23:16.416
I always follow the five "P" s:

23:16.417 --> 23:17.459
Proper planning prevents

23:17.460 --> 23:18.500
poor procedure.

23:18.542 --> 23:20.417
- Nico, are the whips still down
- on main deck?

23:20.420 --> 23:22.458
- Yep.
- All right, go grab 'em, now.

23:23.875 --> 23:25.333
- Nice, nice, nice.

23:25.375 --> 23:26.768
- So are you sticking
- to the menu?

23:26.792 --> 23:28.042
- Not really.
- Okay, great.

23:28.083 --> 23:29.417
Didn't think you would.

23:29.458 --> 23:30.917
- If you screw up
- the first meal,

23:30.920 --> 23:32.750
People are pretty unforgiving,

23:32.792 --> 23:34.105
so I'm just doing

23:34.106 --> 23:35.416
family-style platters

23:35.417 --> 23:36.667
so everyone can make

23:36.668 --> 23:37.916
their own choices.

23:37.917 --> 23:39.375
- Okay, I'm chopping
- the chicken.

23:39.417 --> 23:40.542
- I'm walking, I'm walking.

23:42.542 --> 23:43.708
- Everything's gorgeous.

23:43.750 --> 23:45.083
- What we have here
- is burrata

23:45.125 --> 23:46.125
And tomato with

23:46.126 --> 23:47.126
a nice balsamic glaze.

23:47.167 --> 23:48.563
Then we have turmeric-roasted

23:48.564 --> 23:49.958
chicken with couscous,

23:50.000 --> 23:51.792
- and over here,
- we have a romaine salad

23:51.833 --> 23:53.375
With green beans, cucumbers,

23:53.417 --> 23:54.958
- and mustard sherry
- vinaigrette.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.125
- But is everything gluten-free?
- Yes, and soy-free.

23:57.167 --> 23:58.688
- Cool.

23:58.689 --> 24:00.208
- This is beautiful.

24:00.250 --> 24:01.809
- Oh, my God, the burrata.
- It's amazing.

24:01.833 --> 24:03.726
- Is there truffle in here,
- or am I imagining it?

24:03.750 --> 24:05.375
- There are truffles.
- Cheers to this.

24:05.417 --> 24:07.101
- Cheers to life
- and all the good people in it.

24:07.125 --> 24:08.375
- Yeah.
- Cheers.

24:08.417 --> 24:09.809
- Ding-ding-ding.
- I love that toast.

24:09.833 --> 24:11.208
- They like it?
- They loved it.

24:11.250 --> 24:13.083
- They're freaking out.
- Thank you.

24:13.125 --> 24:14.893
- - Okay, we're dropping,
- and I want four shots.

24:14.917 --> 24:16.042
- Roger that, four shots.

24:16.083 --> 24:17.292
- Drop it.

24:21.667 --> 24:24.957
[cell phone ringing]

24:24.958 --> 24:25.958
- Hello?

24:26.000 --> 24:27.333
- This is Sierra.

24:27.375 --> 24:29.166
- Hi, Sierra, how are you?

24:29.167 --> 24:30.167
- I'm good.

24:30.208 --> 24:31.167
I'm here in Tortola.

24:31.208 --> 24:32.833
I'm so sorry.

24:32.875 --> 24:34.268
- I'm here.
- I'd like to come on board.

24:34.292 --> 24:35.667
- I don't know...
- What happened?

24:35.670 --> 24:37.083
- I missed my flight.

24:37.125 --> 24:39.000
- How the hell
- did you miss your flight?

24:39.003 --> 24:41.143
- - I don't know, I just didn't
- hear when they called.

24:41.167 --> 24:42.667
- Really?

24:42.708 --> 24:44.500
- You know, Sierra,
- we're really short-handed

24:44.503 --> 24:45.542
And we need the help,

24:45.543 --> 24:46.583
so if you're willing,

24:46.625 --> 24:48.184
- I'll send somebody in
- to pick you up.

24:48.208 --> 24:49.521
- Definitely.

24:49.522 --> 24:50.832
- And you will be there.

24:50.833 --> 24:52.500
- Absolutely.

24:52.501 --> 24:54.166
Thank you. See you soon.

24:54.167 --> 24:56.167
- Will you go out and just
- kind of check on them?

24:56.170 --> 24:58.130
- Kate, Lee. Got a second
- to come to the bridge?

24:58.167 --> 25:00.332
- On my way.

25:00.333 --> 25:02.063
- So facing like that?

25:02.064 --> 25:03.792
- Yep, 45, perfect.

25:03.833 --> 25:05.476
- I'll be right back,
- I'm gonna check trash.

25:05.500 --> 25:06.667
- We got this. Stand back.

25:06.668 --> 25:07.833
Can we get one more towel?

25:07.875 --> 25:09.667
Stick one here, one here?

25:09.708 --> 25:11.208
- Perfect.

25:11.250 --> 25:12.563
- No, see, one, two, three,

25:12.564 --> 25:13.875
four, five, on line.

25:13.917 --> 25:15.146
One, two, three, four, five,

25:15.147 --> 25:16.375
not on line.

25:16.417 --> 25:18.292
- Okay, Trevor,
- I think that's a bit much.

25:18.333 --> 25:19.958
- No, we're gonna do it
- perfect.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.207
- We have a stew.

25:21.208 --> 25:22.458
- Wow, that was so quick.

25:22.500 --> 25:24.042
- Well, it's the same stew.

25:24.083 --> 25:26.042
She missed her plane.

25:26.083 --> 25:27.708
- I'm not gonna hold it
- against Sierra

25:27.711 --> 25:29.458
That she missed her flight,

25:29.500 --> 25:31.188
but she'll be working

25:31.189 --> 25:32.874
double time to make up for it.

25:32.875 --> 25:34.208
- Wow.
- Wow.

25:34.250 --> 25:35.708
- So relieved.
- Yes.

25:37.708 --> 25:40.059
- I have a favor to ask, if you
- could just shut off your Wi-Fi,

25:40.083 --> 25:41.893
- Because if too many are on,
- I can't get on.

25:41.917 --> 25:43.684
- Like, I see two of you.
- I'm not being rude, obviously.

25:43.708 --> 25:45.542
- What would you ladies
- like to do after lunch?

25:45.545 --> 25:47.542
- You can go to Willy T's, which
- is, like, a famous bar here.

25:47.545 --> 25:49.351
- It's actually an old
- pirate ship kind of deal.

25:49.375 --> 25:50.375
- Oh, yeah.

25:50.376 --> 25:51.376
- I'm so into Willy T.

25:51.417 --> 25:53.726
- Okay, and the deckhands will
- bring towels and everything,

25:53.750 --> 25:55.083
- So you don't
- have to worry about it.

25:55.086 --> 25:56.667
Deck, this is Kate.

25:56.708 --> 25:58.059
- The guests want to go
- to Willy T's.

25:58.083 --> 26:00.042
- Willy T.
- My dignity's there.

26:00.083 --> 26:01.916
- Exactly, my morals.

26:01.917 --> 26:03.250
- Pull on your stern.

26:03.292 --> 26:04.916
Coming down.

26:04.917 --> 26:06.208
- Captain Lee just informed me

26:06.250 --> 26:07.393
we're getting our third stew.

26:07.417 --> 26:08.750
- Oh, wow.

26:08.792 --> 26:10.417
- She made the plane;
- she's coming.

26:10.458 --> 26:12.083
- Do we have a name?
- Sierra Storm.

26:12.125 --> 26:13.583
- Sierra Storm?

26:13.625 --> 26:15.417
- I hope that turns out
- better than Rocky Dakota.

26:15.420 --> 26:17.417
- It sounds like
- they could be cousins.

26:17.420 --> 26:19.333
- Do you want me to hold
- your phone too?

26:19.375 --> 26:21.434
- I don't come with anything
- less than ten extra batteries.

26:21.458 --> 26:23.083
[indistinct conversation]

26:23.125 --> 26:24.417
- Thank you.
- No problem.

26:24.458 --> 26:25.688
- Going down.

26:25.689 --> 26:26.917
[all cheering]

26:29.792 --> 26:31.625
- Willy T's.
- Willy T's?

26:31.628 --> 26:32.957
- It's a floating shipwreck.

26:32.958 --> 26:34.292
- Oh, cum-bar?

26:34.333 --> 26:35.791
- Very famous.

26:35.792 --> 26:37.226
- If you take your top off
- or something,

26:37.250 --> 26:38.624
You get a free drink.

26:38.625 --> 26:40.458
- Sounds like a very
- classy establishment.

26:40.461 --> 26:41.958
- [laughing]
- Yeah, there you go.

26:41.961 --> 26:43.458
- Grab one hand,
- I'll grab the other.

26:43.461 --> 26:45.124
- Ah!

26:45.125 --> 26:46.209
- Thank you, guys.

26:46.210 --> 26:47.292
- You're welcome. Have fun.

26:47.333 --> 26:49.292
- God, she's so hot.

26:49.333 --> 26:50.750
[laughs]

26:55.500 --> 26:56.729
- Babe, ah, it's pretty...

26:56.730 --> 26:57.957
I don't know.

26:57.958 --> 26:59.042
It's a little crazy,

26:59.043 --> 27:00.124
but it's fine.

27:00.125 --> 27:01.583
I'm happy for her, you know?

27:01.625 --> 27:03.625
I am, I really am.

27:03.667 --> 27:05.708
I think it's wild.

27:05.750 --> 27:07.334
I have my doubts whether Kate

27:07.335 --> 27:08.917
actually likes Ro.

27:08.958 --> 27:11.271
It's really odd for a girl

27:11.272 --> 27:13.583
to change sexuality

27:13.625 --> 27:15.499
at the age of 32.

27:15.500 --> 27:16.750
I don't know if it's just

27:16.751 --> 27:18.000
a switch you can just flip.

27:18.042 --> 27:21.166
Kate now has a girlfriend.

27:21.167 --> 27:22.917
And I'm still single.

27:22.958 --> 27:26.332
[laughing]

27:26.333 --> 27:27.666
And I'm still single.

27:27.667 --> 27:28.750
Whatever makes her happy,

27:28.751 --> 27:29.832
you know?

27:29.833 --> 27:32.875
[cheering]

27:35.042 --> 27:36.833
- Oh, my God.

27:36.875 --> 27:39.667
- Whoo!

27:39.708 --> 27:41.000
- Go!
- Come on!

27:41.042 --> 27:42.750
[all cheering]

27:42.792 --> 27:44.166
- Whoo!

27:44.167 --> 27:46.333
- Get it, girl!

27:46.375 --> 27:48.351
- - Can I get Kate and Kelley
- to the swim platform?

27:48.375 --> 27:49.917
We've got a boat coming in.

27:49.958 --> 27:51.375
- - Copy.
- Roger that.

27:56.875 --> 27:58.958
- Who is this?

27:59.000 --> 28:00.167
- Is this our stew?

28:03.875 --> 28:04.959
- The other two deckhands

28:04.960 --> 28:06.042
are having

28:06.083 --> 28:07.874
a little issue with Trevor.

28:07.875 --> 28:09.542
- He's your
- responsibility now.

28:09.545 --> 28:11.792
- You think you're indispensible,
- you're not.

28:16.583 --> 28:17.583
- Is this our stew?

28:18.375 --> 28:19.541
- Mm-hmm, our third stew.

28:19.542 --> 28:22.000
- That was quick.

28:22.042 --> 28:23.667
- Hi.
- Hey.

28:23.708 --> 28:25.708
- I'm so glad you could make it.
- Thank you so much.

28:25.709 --> 28:26.708
- Here, give me your bag.

28:26.709 --> 28:27.875
- All right, there we go.

28:27.917 --> 28:29.375
- I'm Sierra.
- Hi. Kate.

28:29.378 --> 28:30.559
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

28:30.583 --> 28:31.542
- Kelley.
- Hi, Sierra.

28:31.583 --> 28:33.125
- Welcome aboard.

28:33.167 --> 28:34.542
- Perfect timing,
- the guests are off the boat.

28:34.545 --> 28:35.707
- I don't know what happened.

28:35.708 --> 28:36.896
I missed my plane.

28:36.897 --> 28:38.082
[laughs]

28:38.083 --> 28:39.583
Um...

28:39.625 --> 28:41.417
- So tell me about yourself.
- How long have you

28:41.420 --> 28:42.917
- Been working on boats?
- Three months.

28:42.920 --> 28:44.583
- I was born
- in Baltimore, Maryland,

28:44.625 --> 28:47.082
To two kind of biker-hippies.

28:47.083 --> 28:48.917
- I wasn't brought up
- with a lot of money.

28:48.920 --> 28:50.333
I feel like I inherited

28:50.375 --> 28:51.563
my parents' gypsy soul,

28:51.564 --> 28:52.749
completely.

28:52.750 --> 28:54.416
- Sierra's here.

28:54.417 --> 28:56.083
- God, it's so nice
- having another stew here now.

28:56.086 --> 28:57.582
I've got a roomie.

28:57.583 --> 28:59.167
- - I went to college
- a few times.

28:59.208 --> 29:00.625
It never really stuck,

29:00.626 --> 29:02.042
and then I found yachting.

29:02.083 --> 29:04.059
- Sierra, we're gonna
- set your bags right out here.

29:04.083 --> 29:05.833
- All right.
- Cool.

29:05.875 --> 29:07.667
- She's cute.
- I wanted to meet her.

29:07.708 --> 29:08.896
- Hey.

29:08.897 --> 29:10.082
- Calm down, baby.

29:10.083 --> 29:11.146
- Hey, Sierra, I'm Trevor,

29:11.147 --> 29:12.208
I'm your senior deckhand.

29:12.250 --> 29:13.417
Sierra's very good-looking,

29:13.458 --> 29:15.208
gorgeous, beautiful.

29:15.250 --> 29:16.417
Me and Sierra

29:16.418 --> 29:17.582
are gonna become besties.

29:17.583 --> 29:19.457
- [laughing]

29:19.458 --> 29:20.958
- Gonna dive right in.
- Is it all right?

29:20.961 --> 29:22.917
- Right now, the guests
- are at Willy T's.

29:22.958 --> 29:25.583
[all cheering]

29:25.625 --> 29:26.957
I'll give you a quick tour

29:26.958 --> 29:28.625
- while we spruce up the cabins.
- Awesome.

29:28.628 --> 29:29.958
- Hi, Captain Lee,
- I'm Sierra.

29:29.961 --> 29:31.375
- How are you?
- Nice to meet you.

29:31.417 --> 29:32.792
- Glad to see
- you finally made it.

29:32.795 --> 29:34.208
- Yes, I'm so sorry
- about that.

29:34.250 --> 29:35.542
- Why don't you come this way?

29:35.583 --> 29:36.791
This is the bridge deck aft.

29:36.792 --> 29:38.625
- They just re-did
- the entire interior,

29:38.628 --> 29:40.792
- So it's perfection,
- but we have to keep it that way.

29:40.795 --> 29:42.250
- I understand.

29:42.292 --> 29:44.875
- Sierra is a total knockout.

29:44.917 --> 29:46.021
That face, those boobs,

29:46.022 --> 29:47.125
that smile, those eyes.

29:47.167 --> 29:48.375
Right in this way.

29:48.417 --> 29:49.625
- Sorry.

29:49.667 --> 29:51.125
- I know,
- there's a lot going on.

29:51.128 --> 29:52.457
I think she was, like, raised

29:52.458 --> 29:53.917
- in an Amish city
- with no mirrors,

29:53.958 --> 29:55.476
- 'cause she doesn't know
- how hot she is.

29:55.500 --> 29:56.791
I look at her and I think,

29:56.792 --> 29:58.458
- "You should be
- a lot more bitchy,

29:58.461 --> 29:59.792
'cause you're really hot."

29:59.833 --> 30:01.434
- So where do you feel
- most comfortable?

30:01.458 --> 30:02.667
- I like working with people.

30:04.042 --> 30:05.292
- How was it?

30:05.333 --> 30:06.458
- It was awesome.
- Good.

30:06.500 --> 30:07.833
- Captain Lee.
- How you doing?

30:07.875 --> 30:09.434
- You're gonna come
- to dinner with us.

30:09.458 --> 30:11.292
- Can I get y'all some drinks?

30:14.292 --> 30:15.625
- Nice to meet you all.

30:15.667 --> 30:17.000
- Oh, hi, you're new.
- Yes.

30:17.042 --> 30:19.000
- Do you have to be blonde
- to work here?

30:19.003 --> 30:20.667
- Blonde, skinny, and hot.
- You're hired.

30:20.670 --> 30:22.166
[laughter]

30:22.167 --> 30:23.768
- How's the crew working out,
- you think?

30:23.792 --> 30:25.292
- I'm happy with my deck crew.

30:25.333 --> 30:27.143
- No high-stress situations
- have happened yet, so...

30:27.167 --> 30:28.417
- It's early.

30:28.458 --> 30:29.833
- Don't make any
- kneejerk decisions.

30:29.836 --> 30:30.958
- Roger that.

30:31.000 --> 30:32.708
- And that'll serve you well.

30:36.500 --> 30:37.958
- Y'all two will
- go down 10:00.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.833
- You may have to stay up
- a little bit later.

30:39.836 --> 30:41.309
- I don't mind, man.
- So you good with it?

30:41.333 --> 30:42.708
- You good with it?
- Yeah, man.

30:42.711 --> 30:44.333
- You good with it?
- All right, cool.

30:44.375 --> 30:46.059
- Hey, you guys make sure
- everything's dried

30:46.083 --> 30:47.500
- Everywhere we need
- to be dried.

30:52.042 --> 30:53.167
- All right, just scrub

30:53.168 --> 30:54.292
this deck, just soap it.

30:54.333 --> 30:56.333
- It's easy.
- Just soap it up, let it dry.

30:56.375 --> 30:57.708
Benny boy.

30:57.750 --> 30:59.333
[food processor whirring]

30:59.375 --> 31:00.688
- Hey, Sierra,

31:00.689 --> 31:02.000
those boobs are gonna fall out.

31:02.042 --> 31:03.792
It's good, I'm sorry.

31:03.833 --> 31:05.354
I'm not looking like...

31:05.355 --> 31:06.874
I mean, maybe.

31:06.875 --> 31:08.333
Will you smile for me?

31:08.375 --> 31:10.333
Hey, Sierra, will you smile?

31:10.375 --> 31:12.167
- With all of your
- mindless thought,

31:12.208 --> 31:14.000
- Why don't you put
- some thought into...

31:14.042 --> 31:15.374
- Mindless thought?

31:15.375 --> 31:16.707
- Doing something with beef

31:16.708 --> 31:19.292
related with social media?

31:19.333 --> 31:20.667
Think about it.

31:20.708 --> 31:22.500
- I've decided that I want
- every dish

31:22.542 --> 31:24.542
To have a social media title.

31:24.583 --> 31:26.125
So I got my new friend Trevor

31:26.126 --> 31:27.667
on the case.

31:27.708 --> 31:28.771
- All right,

31:28.772 --> 31:29.833
beef, social media.

31:32.417 --> 31:34.042
- It looks so great.

31:34.083 --> 31:35.851
- It's like the signature color
- is everywhere.

31:35.875 --> 31:37.667
Turquoise everywhere.

31:37.708 --> 31:39.167
- Uh... beef...

31:39.208 --> 31:40.833
[groaning]

31:40.875 --> 31:42.249
- Hey, ladies!

31:42.250 --> 31:44.250
- Oh, my God,
- look at these supermodels!

31:44.253 --> 31:45.646
- Yeah.

31:45.647 --> 31:47.042
- Damn!

31:47.083 --> 31:49.500
- I'm on to it, hold on.

31:49.542 --> 31:50.749
Filets-book.

31:50.750 --> 31:52.333
- Huh?
- Filets-book.

31:52.375 --> 31:53.333
- Filet...

31:53.375 --> 31:55.167
- Facebook, Filets-book.

31:55.208 --> 31:56.542
- Kate's really good
- at this.

31:56.583 --> 31:58.184
- They should be able
- to, like, earn likes

31:58.208 --> 31:59.417
Or give likes to people.

31:59.458 --> 32:00.667
- Insta-Ham.

32:00.708 --> 32:01.896
- But there is no ham.

32:01.897 --> 32:03.083
- Agh!

32:03.125 --> 32:04.351
- Do you feel like you
- could see my vagina?

32:04.375 --> 32:05.625
Is it, like, that high?

32:05.667 --> 32:07.083
- No, I think
- you just feel that.

32:07.125 --> 32:08.458
- No, and if I see it,
- I'll be like,

32:08.461 --> 32:09.809
- "Your vagina's sticking out."
- Okay.

32:09.833 --> 32:11.458
- Social meat-ia,
- instead of media.

32:11.500 --> 32:13.309
- Social meat-ia.
- Oh, 'cause he's making meat.

32:13.333 --> 32:15.083
- Social meat-ia,
- yeah, I like it.

32:15.125 --> 32:16.125
- I like that idea.

32:16.126 --> 32:17.125
- Thumbs up!

32:17.126 --> 32:19.226
- Good job, I'm very proud
- of you right now, actually.

32:19.250 --> 32:20.893
- You can announce very course
- and be like,

32:20.917 --> 32:22.042
"And next we have..."

32:22.083 --> 32:23.250
- I will do that.
- Can I?

32:23.292 --> 32:24.708
- Yes, please.
- Okay.

32:24.750 --> 32:26.458
- Guys, I just ran out
- of storage on my phone.

32:26.461 --> 32:28.083
- Carley, you tagged me,

32:28.125 --> 32:29.375
- but it was a picture
- of her.

32:29.417 --> 32:30.726
- All right, ladies,
- if you'd like

32:30.750 --> 32:32.143
- To move out
- to the dinner table.

32:32.167 --> 32:33.624
It's social media-themed.

32:33.625 --> 32:34.834
So if you like a drink,

32:34.835 --> 32:36.042
if you like a food item,

32:36.083 --> 32:38.059
- if you like... anything you like,
- you also post it,

32:38.083 --> 32:39.291
So you can leave your comment,

32:39.292 --> 32:40.726
- just like you would
- on the Internet.

32:40.750 --> 32:42.021
- Oh, my God,

32:42.022 --> 32:43.292
it's not loading!

32:43.333 --> 32:45.458
- If these ladies would look up
- from their phones

32:45.461 --> 32:47.333
For one second,

32:47.375 --> 32:48.771
they might be able to see

32:48.772 --> 32:50.166
all the ♪hardwork

32:50.167 --> 32:52.125
- we've put into their evening
- for them.

32:52.167 --> 32:53.625
I'm gonna go check on dinner.

32:53.667 --> 32:55.000
- Thank you.

32:55.042 --> 32:56.458
- They're moving
- to the table now.

32:56.500 --> 32:57.976
- Okay, I'll join them
- for a cocktail,

32:58.000 --> 32:59.333
But I'm not going to eat.

32:59.375 --> 33:00.583
- Of course,
- I'll go explain,

33:00.625 --> 33:01.750
And then you can come on up.

33:01.792 --> 33:02.792
- Thank you.

33:05.792 --> 33:07.833
- Are you in a relationship?
- No.

33:07.875 --> 33:10.292
- Because I am single,
- I'm not gonna rule anything out.

33:10.333 --> 33:12.166
Oh...

33:12.167 --> 33:14.351
- I don't really have a type
- as far as guys are concerned.

33:14.375 --> 33:16.438
I like short guys, tall guys,

33:16.439 --> 33:18.500
fat guys, every kind of guy.

33:18.542 --> 33:20.333
- So we'll see.
- See what unfolds.

33:20.375 --> 33:22.000
- We'll see. Yeah.

33:22.042 --> 33:23.666
- Hey, Nico, I'll do lates.

33:23.667 --> 33:25.625
Whoever that is, swap with me,

33:25.667 --> 33:27.643
- because Kate's wanting me
- to read it to the guests.

33:27.667 --> 33:28.688
- Speak to Kelley

33:28.689 --> 33:29.708
about that, man.

33:29.750 --> 33:30.958
I'm done at...

33:31.000 --> 33:32.874
- No, I mean, I'm telling you,

33:32.875 --> 33:34.333
lates is gonna be me.

33:34.375 --> 33:35.643
- I don't...
- I don't understand.

33:35.667 --> 33:37.333
- Didn't he give us
- bedtimes before?

33:37.375 --> 33:38.792
- Yeah, I'm done at 11:00.

33:38.833 --> 33:40.208
- So you're off,
- is what I'm saying.

33:40.211 --> 33:42.000
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

33:42.042 --> 33:43.417
- I'll have a cup

33:43.418 --> 33:44.792
of tea, then.

33:44.833 --> 33:46.250
- But after this, yeah,

33:46.251 --> 33:47.667
everything Kelley says goes.

33:49.875 --> 33:51.393
- Everything's going
- really smoothly,

33:51.417 --> 33:52.646
But, like, Trevor telling us

33:52.647 --> 33:53.874
to do every little thing.

33:53.875 --> 33:55.500
- Trevor!
- It doesn't matter

33:55.542 --> 33:57.208
- If the guests ask you
- to take your shirt off.

33:57.211 --> 33:58.251
Don't take your shirt off.

34:01.917 --> 34:03.417
- Hashtag "flashback film"
on my old-school camera.

34:05.542 --> 34:06.709
- The captain has arrived.

34:06.710 --> 34:07.874
- Yeah!

34:07.875 --> 34:09.833
- Mwah!

34:09.875 --> 34:11.146
- Hashtag "perfect."

34:11.147 --> 34:12.417
- Hashtag "do it."

34:12.458 --> 34:13.771
- Hashtag "call to service,"

34:13.772 --> 34:15.081
which means,

34:15.083 --> 34:16.646
girls, girls, Trevor,

34:16.647 --> 34:18.208
please come to the galley.

34:18.250 --> 34:20.146
- And if we could, we could

34:20.147 --> 34:22.042
double-tap you the whole night.

34:22.083 --> 34:24.101
- It's been a while
- since I've been double-tapped.

34:24.125 --> 34:26.917
[laughter]

34:26.958 --> 34:28.250
- Hashtag "stole that meat."

34:28.292 --> 34:29.750
- Okay.
- Can we rally their service?

34:29.792 --> 34:31.333
I mean it.

34:31.375 --> 34:32.646
- Girls, girls, girls,

34:32.647 --> 34:33.916
to the galley, please, quickly?

34:33.917 --> 34:35.667
Social meat-ia.

34:35.708 --> 34:38.081
- Hashtag "idiot."

34:38.083 --> 34:39.083
- Hey, Trevor.

34:39.083 --> 34:40.083
- Hey, Trevor.

34:40.083 --> 34:41.248
- Good evening, ladies.

34:41.250 --> 34:44.500
[cheering]

34:44.542 --> 34:45.813
All right, so this is

34:45.813 --> 34:47.081
a social meat-ia

34:47.083 --> 34:48.667
with a "thread" wine reduction

34:48.668 --> 34:50.248
and "emote" cheese.

34:50.250 --> 34:52.123
[laughter]

34:52.125 --> 34:53.601
- I hear laughter.
- What do you need?

34:53.625 --> 34:55.125
- Bring that up,
- follow Kate, please.

34:55.128 --> 34:57.250
- Yes, sir.

34:57.292 --> 34:58.601
- "Thread" wine?
- That looks delicious.

34:58.625 --> 34:59.791
- Kate and Kelley!

34:59.792 --> 35:01.583
[cheering]

35:01.625 --> 35:03.209
- The next dish is a side

35:03.210 --> 35:04.791
of "hashtag" browns.

35:04.792 --> 35:06.208
- Hashtag browns?

35:06.250 --> 35:07.354
Whoever came up with this

35:07.355 --> 35:08.458
is brilliant.

35:08.500 --> 35:10.229
I'll give all of my likes

35:10.230 --> 35:11.957
to Kelley.

35:11.958 --> 35:13.458
- The next two sides

35:13.459 --> 35:14.958
are chicken "Tinder"

35:15.000 --> 35:18.083
with a balsamic "glaze" -book,

35:18.125 --> 35:19.458
with cauli- "follower."

35:19.500 --> 35:20.750
- Oh, my God.
- That is so good.

35:20.792 --> 35:22.125
- Where do you think
- you're going?

35:22.128 --> 35:23.458
- I'm going
- to check the kitchen.

35:23.461 --> 35:24.809
- No, you're coming
- to sit with us.

35:24.833 --> 35:26.083
- No.

35:26.125 --> 35:27.458
- I'm trying to
- help you out, honey.

35:27.461 --> 35:28.809
- I'm married with kids,
- but, I mean,

35:28.833 --> 35:30.458
- You guys would have
- some gorgeous kids.

35:30.461 --> 35:31.934
- - I'm really impressed
- with Kelley.

35:31.958 --> 35:33.146
Clearly, the guest

35:33.147 --> 35:34.332
is interested in him.

35:34.333 --> 35:35.750
He likes her.

35:35.792 --> 35:37.438
But he's focusing

35:37.439 --> 35:39.083
on his real job

35:39.125 --> 35:40.646
rather than pursuing

35:40.647 --> 35:42.166
another kind of job.

35:42.167 --> 35:44.000
- You did amazing,
- really good job.

35:44.003 --> 35:45.500
- Look at my likes
- and my hashtags.

35:45.503 --> 35:47.125
- I know,
- you hashtag "killed it."

35:47.167 --> 35:48.500
- I know I raised
- the charter tips.

35:48.503 --> 35:50.166
I was amazing.

35:50.167 --> 35:51.500
The whole dinner,

35:51.501 --> 35:52.832
I made the dinner happen.

35:52.833 --> 35:54.458
Me, Ben, and Kate crushed it.

35:54.500 --> 35:56.101
- I'm going down, Kate,
- you cool with that?

35:56.125 --> 35:57.292
- I'm cool with it.
- Cool.

35:57.333 --> 35:58.667
- Ben, good night.
- Emily, good night.

35:58.670 --> 35:59.750
- Sleep good.

35:59.751 --> 36:00.832
- Thank you for your help.

36:00.833 --> 36:01.999
- "You have great tits."

36:02.000 --> 36:03.625
[laughter]

36:03.667 --> 36:05.292
- Ladies, I am gonna turn in.

36:05.333 --> 36:06.333
- Thank you so much.

36:06.334 --> 36:07.333
- Good night.

36:07.334 --> 36:09.167
- Hashtag
- "get me out of here."

36:12.000 --> 36:13.417
- I love you.
- Good night, friend.

36:13.458 --> 36:15.417
- Good night, guys.

36:21.542 --> 36:23.042
- Maybe I'll send you
- to laundry,

36:23.045 --> 36:24.875
- Just to get familiar...
- Where everything is.

36:24.878 --> 36:26.875
- I'm sure there's
- something to do.

36:26.917 --> 36:27.938
- I spend a lot of time

36:27.939 --> 36:28.958
in the laundry room.

36:40.208 --> 36:42.458
Sometimes it's great to go away

36:42.459 --> 36:44.707
and kind of relax.

36:44.708 --> 36:45.958
It's weird;

36:45.959 --> 36:47.208
laundry is relaxing.

36:51.667 --> 36:53.063
- Ugh.

36:53.064 --> 36:54.458
- My feet are killing me.

36:54.500 --> 36:55.541
- I have to sit down.

36:55.542 --> 36:56.771
- Can we soak our feet?

36:56.772 --> 36:58.000
- Yeah.

36:58.042 --> 37:00.208
[laughter]

37:00.250 --> 37:01.708
- Watch out,
- this could be too hot.

37:01.750 --> 37:03.542
- Okay, good.
- No, it's so good.

37:03.583 --> 37:04.916
You're a genius.

37:04.917 --> 37:06.375
- I know.
- "I know."

37:06.417 --> 37:08.042
- I know.

37:08.083 --> 37:09.917
- I feel like I'm in a spa,
- it's so good.

37:11.542 --> 37:13.208
[laughter]

37:13.250 --> 37:14.542
- It's so refreshing

37:14.543 --> 37:15.833
to be working with Ben,

37:15.875 --> 37:17.667
where there's no question like,

37:17.708 --> 37:18.917
"Is this flirting?

37:18.958 --> 37:20.583
- Is it not flirting?
- I don't know."

37:20.586 --> 37:21.833
It's getting pretty hot.

37:21.875 --> 37:23.167
- Are you starting to sweat?

37:23.208 --> 37:24.167
- Yes.

37:24.208 --> 37:25.375
You once told me...

37:27.750 --> 37:29.083
Because I get really hot.

37:29.125 --> 37:30.875
- You do?
- Yeah.

37:34.458 --> 37:36.083
Kate seems happier than ever,

37:36.125 --> 37:37.959
obviously happier than,

37:37.960 --> 37:39.792
you know, I could have provided.

37:39.833 --> 37:42.083
[laughs]

37:42.125 --> 37:44.417
Yeah.

37:44.458 --> 37:46.042
- Can't even think.
- Oh, gosh.

37:46.083 --> 37:47.167
- I mean, I feel

37:47.168 --> 37:48.250
like a new woman.

37:48.292 --> 37:49.625
- So how do you feel

37:49.626 --> 37:50.958
about Nico and Trevor?

37:51.000 --> 37:52.125
- I'm excited.

37:52.167 --> 37:53.957
I'm glad with our deck crew.

37:53.958 --> 37:56.208
- Yeah.
- Trevor's a little bit more...

37:56.250 --> 37:57.625
- He's like,
- "I'm senior deckhand."

37:57.628 --> 37:59.375
I'm like, "Whoa, whoa."

37:59.417 --> 38:00.768
- We'll listen to you;
- we're not fighting back.

38:00.792 --> 38:02.291
Like, we understand.

38:02.292 --> 38:03.709
- And it'll be good

38:03.710 --> 38:05.124
to have his experience.

38:05.125 --> 38:06.459
And I think Nico and you,

38:06.460 --> 38:07.791
very good.

38:07.792 --> 38:09.625
- Oh, that's good to hear,
- thank you.

38:23.167 --> 38:24.500
- Has anyone done, like,

38:24.501 --> 38:25.832
a wipe-down yet this morning

38:25.833 --> 38:27.166
of just the boat?

38:27.167 --> 38:28.625
- Yeah, me.

38:28.667 --> 38:30.292
- Yeah, well,
- that's what I was...

38:30.333 --> 38:32.601
- Cleaned off all the tables,
- got it ready for breakfast.

38:32.625 --> 38:36.250
There's a couple marks near,

38:36.292 --> 38:37.583
like, bridge control,

38:37.625 --> 38:38.667
on the outside, whatever.

38:38.708 --> 38:40.000
- The wing station?

38:40.042 --> 38:41.833
- Yeah, wing station,
- there you go.

38:41.875 --> 38:43.146
I got a bucket set up

38:43.147 --> 38:44.417
on the aft deck.

38:44.458 --> 38:46.292
- On the main deck aft?
- Huh?

38:46.333 --> 38:47.583
- On the main deck aft?

38:47.625 --> 38:49.000
- Main deck aft,
- aft deck, yeah.

38:50.792 --> 38:52.250
- Wait, do we have
- any guests up?

38:52.292 --> 38:53.851
- They're in their cabins
- having coffee.

38:53.875 --> 38:55.184
- They could come out
- at any second.

38:55.208 --> 38:56.333
- Fruit's done.

38:56.375 --> 38:58.083
- Are you making sausage?

38:58.125 --> 39:00.309
- You know I like stealing sausage
- when you're not looking.

39:00.333 --> 39:02.874
- Sometimes I wake up.

39:02.875 --> 39:04.958
[laughter]

39:05.000 --> 39:06.313
- So, yeah, these windows,

39:06.314 --> 39:07.625
and then flats,

39:07.667 --> 39:09.541
scuppers, stainless.

39:09.542 --> 39:11.207
I'll be right back.

39:11.208 --> 39:12.708
- It's like I never worked

39:12.709 --> 39:14.207
on a boat before.

39:14.208 --> 39:16.143
- Oh, my God, I feel like
- we're, like, in Capri.

39:16.167 --> 39:17.958
- I know.
- It's beautiful.

39:18.000 --> 39:19.708
- Uh, Nico, do you mind
- if we talk for a sec?

39:19.711 --> 39:20.875
- Yes.

39:20.876 --> 39:22.042
- Come on.

39:22.083 --> 39:23.542
- How are you feeling?

39:23.583 --> 39:24.893
- What's your whole take
- on this so far?

39:24.917 --> 39:26.542
- I think we're
- a really good team.

39:26.545 --> 39:28.084
Everyone participates in every

39:28.085 --> 39:29.625
different way of knowledge.

39:29.667 --> 39:31.000
But, like, Trevor telling us

39:31.001 --> 39:32.333
to do, like, every little thing.

39:32.375 --> 39:33.792
If we were green,

39:33.793 --> 39:35.207
I understand, but we're not.

39:35.208 --> 39:36.500
- Nobody's green here.
- Yeah.

39:36.542 --> 39:38.042
- Let me talk to him
- about that.

39:38.083 --> 39:40.042
- You and Lauren are literally
- my dream deckhands.

39:40.045 --> 39:41.542
He needs to, like...

39:41.583 --> 39:42.707
- I respect him as that,

39:42.708 --> 39:44.083
- and you as boatswain
- and stuff...

39:44.086 --> 39:45.208
- Hold up, hold up.

39:45.250 --> 39:48.167
Hey, Trevor!

39:48.208 --> 39:49.583
- Got to be smarter
- than that.

39:49.625 --> 39:51.208
- That's unprofessional.

39:51.250 --> 39:52.601
- Doesn't matter
- if the guests ask for you

39:52.625 --> 39:54.000
To take your shirt off.

39:54.042 --> 39:55.351
- Don't take your shirt off,
- please.

39:55.375 --> 39:56.583
- As the boatswain,
- it's my job

39:56.586 --> 39:58.250
To deal with Trevor,

39:58.292 --> 40:00.083
- and if I don't deal with it
- in the correct way,

40:00.086 --> 40:02.083
- It could be me going home
- at the end of this charter.

40:02.086 --> 40:03.667
- Thanks.
- No, thank you.

40:03.708 --> 40:05.583
- Here comes Ben.
- Ben!

40:05.586 --> 40:06.917
- Ben, we're so hungry.

40:06.918 --> 40:08.249
- Good.

40:08.250 --> 40:09.459
- Fantastic.

40:09.460 --> 40:10.667
- This bacon is so good.

40:10.708 --> 40:12.521
- I feel like everything's,

40:12.522 --> 40:14.333
like, so fresh.

40:14.375 --> 40:16.250
- Hey, Captain Lee.
- What do you need?

40:20.750 --> 40:22.083
Captain Lee.
- What do you need?

40:22.750 --> 40:23.958
- Um, Trevor...

40:26.625 --> 40:27.958
The other two deckhands

40:28.000 --> 40:29.958
- are having a little issue
- with him.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.457
He's a little brash,

40:32.458 --> 40:34.021
and he's treating them

40:34.022 --> 40:35.583
like greenies.

40:35.625 --> 40:38.438
How would you communicate

40:38.439 --> 40:41.250
that to him if you were me?

40:41.292 --> 40:42.875
- If I have to do my job
- and yours,

40:42.917 --> 40:44.458
What do I need you for?

40:44.500 --> 40:46.458
- Just sit him down one-to-one
- and go,

40:46.461 --> 40:48.167
"If you don't tone it down

40:48.168 --> 40:49.875
and ease up on the gas,

40:49.917 --> 40:51.375
we're gonna have issues."

40:51.417 --> 40:54.124
And just say, "Listen,

40:54.125 --> 40:55.834
"if you think you're

40:55.835 --> 40:57.542
indispensible, you're not.

40:57.583 --> 40:59.124
Nobody is."

40:59.125 --> 41:00.791
- Oh, sh...

41:00.792 --> 41:02.625
- He's your responsibility,
- not mine.

41:02.667 --> 41:04.146
If he becomes mine,

41:04.147 --> 41:05.625
then you dropped the ball.

41:07.792 --> 41:09.167
- Okay.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.499
- This season on "Below Deck"...

41:13.500 --> 41:14.500
- Three.
- Two.

41:14.542 --> 41:15.833
- One.
- Go!

41:15.836 --> 41:17.458
- I always get excited
- about seeing

41:17.500 --> 41:18.832
How the crew are gonna mesh.

41:18.833 --> 41:21.666
You hope for the best...

41:21.667 --> 41:22.750
26 grand.

41:22.751 --> 41:23.832
- Wow.

41:23.833 --> 41:25.332
- But you plan for the worst.

41:25.333 --> 41:26.667
- Dude, get the f... out...

41:26.708 --> 41:28.125
Get the f... out of the car!

41:28.167 --> 41:29.667
- I think he deserves
- one more chance.

41:29.670 --> 41:31.792
- So we should wait
- till he actually kills someone.

41:31.833 --> 41:33.083
I've got a new haircut,

41:33.084 --> 41:34.333
two new stews, new girlfriend.

41:34.375 --> 41:36.292
Hi, babe.

41:36.333 --> 41:37.625
- Kate and Ro, they're just,

41:37.626 --> 41:38.917
like, so happy together.

41:40.167 --> 41:41.832
- It's great; it's awesome.

41:41.833 --> 41:43.458
- It's so hard.

41:43.500 --> 41:45.167
- For me, it's definitely
- about redemption.

41:45.170 --> 41:47.167
- Take up on it right away,
- let's go.

41:47.170 --> 41:49.707
Nice job, deckhands, thank you.

41:49.708 --> 41:51.708
- Love is in the air.

41:51.750 --> 41:53.708
- I'll follow you, wherever.

41:53.750 --> 41:54.813
- And it's spreading

41:54.814 --> 41:55.875
among the crew.

41:55.917 --> 41:58.125
[cheering]

41:58.167 --> 42:00.542
- How about you,
- jumping from girl to girl here,

42:00.545 --> 42:01.875
Seeing who you can hook up with,

42:01.876 --> 42:03.207
just to give it a go?

42:03.208 --> 42:05.542
- No doubt, drama will happen,
- fingers crossed.

42:05.545 --> 42:06.833
- Hungry, Scupper?

42:06.875 --> 42:08.542
- I'm prepping dog food
- right now.

42:08.545 --> 42:10.125
- Uh-oh.

42:10.167 --> 42:11.874
- She is a psychic.

42:11.875 --> 42:13.555
- Now, Captain Lee,
- your mother's here...

42:14.542 --> 42:15.707
Is that correct?

42:15.708 --> 42:17.125
- No.

42:19.542 --> 42:21.375
- Oh, my God.
- Wow.

42:21.378 --> 42:23.333
- Why do you take
- everything so harsh, though?

42:23.375 --> 42:24.875
- Good job,
- senior deckhand.

42:24.917 --> 42:26.541
- You can't have my back.

42:26.542 --> 42:28.208
- Don't treat me
- like I'm a green deckhand.

42:28.211 --> 42:29.393
- They're undermining me
- when you're gone.

42:29.417 --> 42:30.541
He's a twat.

42:30.542 --> 42:31.917
- Come over here...
- Yes.

42:31.920 --> 42:33.268
- So I can rip
- your f... ing head off.

42:33.292 --> 42:34.708
I would be tickled to death

42:34.750 --> 42:36.250
- not to hand out
- one plane ticket.

42:36.253 --> 42:38.268
- This is not your personal
- f... ing party palace.

42:38.292 --> 42:40.208
[cheering]

42:40.250 --> 42:42.583
[laughter]

42:42.625 --> 42:43.583
- Oh, God!

42:43.625 --> 42:44.583
Oh!

42:44.625 --> 42:46.583
[alarm ringing]

42:46.625 --> 42:47.667
- I think that

42:47.668 --> 42:48.708
once is an accident.

42:48.750 --> 42:50.063
- You should have done that

42:50.064 --> 42:51.375
before 6:00 at night.

42:51.417 --> 42:52.708
- Twice is a pattern.

42:52.750 --> 42:53.834
- Stop with the fake

42:53.835 --> 42:54.916
happy-scary face.

42:54.917 --> 42:56.934
- If you don't want to go
- to your happy, groovy place,

42:56.958 --> 42:57.979
You can go make beds

42:57.980 --> 42:59.000
and clean the toilets.

42:59.042 --> 43:00.917
- Do I believe
- there'll be a third time?

43:00.958 --> 43:02.313
- When I leave this boat,

43:02.314 --> 43:03.667
I'm not talking to you anymore.

43:03.708 --> 43:05.250
- Learn how
- to f... ing communicate.

43:05.292 --> 43:06.416
- Dude, I am communicating!

43:06.417 --> 43:07.916
- Without a doubt.

43:07.917 --> 43:09.184
- I don't like working
- with you anymore.

43:09.208 --> 43:11.208
- I just feel so used.

43:11.250 --> 43:12.958
[laughter]

43:13.000 --> 43:14.667
- - For more "Below Deck,"
- go to:
