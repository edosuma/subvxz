00:56.989 --> 00:59.057
        Well, I got to say it   
        for you, Edith.         

00:59.059 --> 01:00.625
              You done it again.

01:00.627 --> 01:02.093
              That there one    
              was a two-notcher.

01:04.864 --> 01:07.498
                  Oh, thank you,
                  Archie.       

01:07.500 --> 01:09.968
        Linda, would you like   
        another piece of pie?   

01:09.970 --> 01:11.036
    No, thanks, Aunt Edith.     

01:11.038 --> 01:12.236
      Save it for Gloria.       

01:12.238 --> 01:13.638
         She's the one          
    that's working overtime.    

01:13.640 --> 01:16.340
 Wait a minute. The meathead's  
     working overtime too.      

01:16.342 --> 01:17.809
          Look at him           
    with his knife and fork.    

01:20.212 --> 01:22.013
    Come on, will you?          
      I just like to eat.       

01:22.015 --> 01:23.414
Well, so does a tapeworm,       

01:23.416 --> 01:26.617
 but we don't need one of them  
     in the house neither.      

01:26.619 --> 01:29.788
            Are you sure, Linda?
            Just a little piece?

01:29.790 --> 01:31.956
 It was delicious, Aunt Edith,  

01:31.958 --> 01:33.457
    but I've already gained     
          four pounds           

01:33.459 --> 01:34.826
     since I've been here.      

01:34.828 --> 01:36.061
I have to watch my weight.      

01:36.063 --> 01:37.896
          The airline           
is very strict about that.      

01:37.898 --> 01:39.130
    That's right. You know,     

01:39.132 --> 01:40.565
        I've never seen         
    a fat stewardess.           

01:40.567 --> 01:43.802
    That's because you live     
     in America, Meathead.      

01:43.804 --> 01:46.771
    The fat dames are flying    
     in them Polack planes.     

01:49.308 --> 01:50.809
Archie, that's                  
a cheap joke,                   

01:50.811 --> 01:53.178
and for your information,       
 Polish State Airlines is rated 

01:53.180 --> 01:55.346
one of the finest airlines      
    in the world, all right?    

01:55.348 --> 01:56.715
      They have a perfect       
         safety record.         

01:56.717 --> 02:00.551
  Good. I'll buy you a ticket   
    anyplace, one-way.          

02:00.553 --> 02:02.253
Look, don't start with me,      
    Archie, all right?          

02:02.255 --> 02:04.989
      Mike, would you like      
     another piece of pie?      

02:04.991 --> 02:06.390
      Oh, no, thanks, Ma.       

02:06.392 --> 02:08.592
     It was a great dinner,     
but I couldn't eat another bite.

02:08.595 --> 02:11.295
        Wait a minute.          
        What was that I hear?   

02:11.297 --> 02:13.231
                He can't eat    
                another bite?   

02:13.233 --> 02:15.900
          Hold it, world.       
          One minute of silence.

02:15.902 --> 02:18.203
        What for?               

02:18.205 --> 02:20.538
     Out of respect, Edith.     

02:20.540 --> 02:23.407
     The meathead's stomach     
        just died.              

02:23.409 --> 02:25.543
Very funny, Arch.               

02:25.545 --> 02:29.013
Yeah, well, I thought so.       

02:29.015 --> 02:29.881
        [BELCHES]               

02:35.420 --> 02:38.289
                Archie, we have 
                company.        

02:38.291 --> 02:40.591
      Linda ain't company.      
         She's family.          

02:40.593 --> 02:42.260
 Bring me another coffee, huh?  

02:42.262 --> 02:43.661
Oh, let me do that,             
Aunt Edith.                     

02:43.663 --> 02:44.929
            I need the practice.

02:44.931 --> 02:46.998
Oh, thank you, Linda.           

02:47.000 --> 02:49.901
      Okay, Uncle Archie,       
      you're on my plane.       

02:49.903 --> 02:52.370
Now, pretend that you're        
a gentleman flying first-class. 

02:52.372 --> 02:54.505
    That's gonna take           
      a lot of pretending.      

02:57.376 --> 03:00.245
                Go ahead, Linda.

03:00.247 --> 03:02.080
Another cup of coffee, sir?     

03:02.082 --> 03:03.614
                  Yes, thank you
                  very much.    

03:03.616 --> 03:04.949
                 I think I will.

03:04.951 --> 03:06.251
        Oh, jeez.               

03:06.253 --> 03:08.019
    Will you clam up?           

03:08.021 --> 03:10.021
      I'm helping the kid       
    with her homework here.     

03:10.023 --> 03:13.091
There you are, sir.             

03:13.093 --> 03:15.493
And if there's anything else    
you need, just ring.            

03:15.495 --> 03:17.461
                Yeah, well,     
                thanks a lot.   

03:17.463 --> 03:19.463
 Now, that's some style there,  
          huh, Edith?           

03:19.465 --> 03:22.500
              Oh, yeah, that was
              very good, Linda. 

03:22.502 --> 03:25.270
Hey, Linda, why don't you let me
      call up your father       

03:25.272 --> 03:27.972
  and ask him if you can stay   
  with us a couple extra days?  

03:27.974 --> 03:30.341
I'd love to,                    
but I really have to go.        

03:30.343 --> 03:31.442
    What's your hurry?          

03:31.444 --> 03:32.844
      Ain't you having fun      
         with us here?          

03:32.846 --> 03:34.179
        Oh, sure, I am,         

03:34.181 --> 03:36.447
    but I'm scheduled to fly    
out of Baltimore tomorrow.      

03:36.449 --> 03:37.949
  Besides, think of poor Mike.  

03:37.951 --> 03:39.317
         Because of me,         

03:39.319 --> 03:41.319
he's been sleeping on that couch
    for two weeks now.          

03:41.321 --> 03:43.288
That's all right, Linda, really.
         I don't mind.          

03:43.290 --> 03:46.657
 Yeah, down here on the couch,  
    he's getting some sleep.    

03:54.033 --> 03:57.001
Don't you sleep good            
upstairs?                       

03:59.438 --> 04:00.972
                 Forget it, huh?

04:00.974 --> 04:05.210
     Maybe their bed ain't      
as comfortable as ours is.      

04:05.212 --> 04:06.911
    I said, forget it.          

04:06.913 --> 04:09.314
     Because you don't have     
         that trouble.          

04:09.316 --> 04:10.982
      You drop right off.       

04:10.984 --> 04:13.451
Will you stifle yourself?       

04:15.921 --> 04:17.521
         Anyway, Linda,         
      you tell your father      

04:17.523 --> 04:19.523
    that whenever you're up     
in this neck of the woods,      

04:19.524 --> 04:21.259
 you're always welcome to stay  
         here with us.          

04:21.261 --> 04:23.228
     Thanks, Uncle Archie.      

04:23.230 --> 04:25.396
     I just might do that.      

04:25.398 --> 04:27.198
        Yeah, and by the way,   
        you tell your father    

04:27.200 --> 04:29.000
             he ought to come up
             for a visit too.   

04:29.002 --> 04:31.336
  You know, when we was kids,   
    we was always together.     

04:31.338 --> 04:34.138
He always was hanging around me,
wanted to be just like me.      

04:34.140 --> 04:36.007
    Now I hardly never          
        see him anymore.        

04:36.009 --> 04:38.642
Just remind him, Baltimore      
 ain't that far from New York.  

04:38.644 --> 04:41.545
         Then how come          
     we don't visit there?      

04:41.547 --> 04:45.316
    New York ain't that far     
     from Baltimore either.     

04:46.818 --> 04:48.119
    That's different, Edith.    

04:48.121 --> 04:51.389
      People from New York      
     don't go to Baltimore.     

04:51.391 --> 04:53.524
            Besides, he's the   
            youngest brother.   

04:53.526 --> 04:54.525
                 It's only right

04:54.527 --> 04:56.094
      that he come and visit me.

04:56.096 --> 04:59.063
      Well, Linda, as long      
as they ain't serving no cigars 

04:59.065 --> 05:00.365
     on your airplane here,     

05:00.367 --> 05:02.733
     I think I'll just jump     
    down to the corner store    

05:02.735 --> 05:04.335
and pick myself up a few.       

05:04.337 --> 05:06.504
 I'll be back in three or four  
     shakes, there, Edith.      

05:06.506 --> 05:07.638
EDITH:                          
All right, Archie.              

05:07.640 --> 05:08.940
                Ooh, I better   
                get going.      

05:08.942 --> 05:09.941
                 It's five to 7.

05:09.943 --> 05:11.509
Are you going out, Linda?       

05:11.511 --> 05:12.977
                 Yeah, I'm going
                 dancing.       

05:12.979 --> 05:13.978
                    Come on, Ma,

05:13.980 --> 05:15.646
                I'll help you   
                clear the table.

05:15.648 --> 05:17.348
Thanks, Mike.                   

05:17.350 --> 05:18.816
Ain't it strange?               

05:18.818 --> 05:19.817
                        What?   

05:19.819 --> 05:23.121
Well, Archie looks              
just like his brother,          

05:23.123 --> 05:26.291
but Linda don't look            
like either one of them.        

05:26.293 --> 05:30.494
Of course, I never looked       
  like my mother or my father.  

05:30.496 --> 05:33.631
 I look like my brother, Harry, 

05:33.633 --> 05:36.467
 but Harry didn't look like me. 

05:36.469 --> 05:39.070
He looked like my sister,       
        Gertrude.               

05:44.977 --> 05:46.744
                  Wait a second.

05:46.746 --> 05:48.413
                If you looked   
                like Harry,     

05:48.415 --> 05:50.448
                and Harry looked
                like Gertrude,  

05:50.450 --> 05:53.418
        then the three of you   
        kids looked alike.      

05:53.420 --> 05:55.553
Only when we was together.

How are you?

 Would you like a piece of pie, 
            Gloria?             

06:06.631 --> 06:08.666
          Maybe later.

06:11.571 --> 06:14.038
          I'll get it.          

06:14.040 --> 06:15.440
                    You're busy.

06:18.310 --> 06:19.310
            Oh, hi, Mrs. Bunker.

Oh, hi, Lionel.

                Are you going   
                somewheres?     

06:26.486 --> 06:28.052
Yep, going dancing.             

06:28.054 --> 06:29.620
                  Ain't that    
                  a coincidence.

06:29.622 --> 06:31.956
                Linda's going   
                dancing too.    

06:33.859 --> 06:34.993
      Hi, Linda.                

06:34.995 --> 06:36.794
    Hi, Gloria. Hi, Lionel.     
    Did I keep you waiting?     

06:36.796 --> 06:37.795
              No, just got here.

06:37.797 --> 06:38.796
                Let me help you.

06:38.798 --> 06:39.864
             Oh...              

06:43.502 --> 06:45.769
             Oh...              

06:50.376 --> 06:51.542
              Oh!               

06:54.146 --> 06:55.846
             Anything wrong, Ma?

06:55.848 --> 06:58.816
    No, but for some reason,    

06:58.818 --> 07:02.353
          your father           
just popped into my mind.       

07:04.023 --> 07:05.890
            Oh, Linda, I've got 
            something for you.  

07:05.892 --> 07:08.526
Oh, I bet I know                
what it is.                     

07:08.528 --> 07:09.960
Oh, I knew it!                  

07:09.962 --> 07:11.029
Look, everybody.                

07:11.031 --> 07:12.363
GLORIA: Oh,                     
that's a nice picture.          

07:12.365 --> 07:13.831
MIKE: That's                    
really nice, yeah.              

07:13.833 --> 07:15.199
    What do you think,          
          Aunt Edith?           

07:15.201 --> 07:18.136
      Oh, it's very nice!       

07:18.138 --> 07:22.507
Lionel's got his arm            
around you, don't he?           

07:22.509 --> 07:23.841
When was this taken?            

07:23.843 --> 07:25.976
         At the party we went to
         last week at Trudy's,  

07:25.978 --> 07:27.111
                    remember?   

07:27.113 --> 07:28.413
              That's where Linda
              met Lionel.       

07:28.415 --> 07:30.048
              Oh.               

07:30.050 --> 07:31.916
                Well, excuse us,
                everybody.      

07:31.918 --> 07:33.518
        We ought to be going.   
        Come on, Linda.         

07:33.520 --> 07:34.652
  Aunt Edith, would you please  

07:34.654 --> 07:36.254
        put the picture         
     in the bedroom for me?     

07:36.256 --> 07:40.758
  I'll put it in your suitcase  
    so you won't forget it.     

07:42.727 --> 07:43.928
Don't hide it. I like it.       

07:43.930 --> 07:45.530
          Just put it           
     on top of the dresser.     

07:45.532 --> 07:46.697
             Bye-bye, everybody.

07:46.699 --> 07:47.565
MIKE:                           
Bye. Have fun.                  

07:52.037 --> 07:53.037
                I didn't know   

07:53.039 --> 07:55.739
                Linda and Lionel
                was dating.     

07:55.741 --> 07:57.141
              Well, they're not 
              really dating, Ma.

07:57.143 --> 07:59.577
            They just like to go
            dancing together.   

07:59.579 --> 08:01.045
Oh, I see.                      

08:01.047 --> 08:03.047
          What's the matter, Ma?

08:03.049 --> 08:06.484
          Oh, nothing.          
     It's just so strange.      

08:06.486 --> 08:08.852
  I guess I'm not used to it.   

08:08.854 --> 08:12.990
You see, in my old neighborhood 
    where I was brought up,     

08:12.992 --> 08:14.925
we all had the same skin,       

08:14.927 --> 08:17.928
     except some was clear      
      and some had bumps.       

08:21.500 --> 08:23.734
             Ma, was your father
             strict with you?   

08:23.736 --> 08:25.470
              I mean, about who 
              you went out with?

08:25.472 --> 08:27.205
Oh, yeah.                       

08:27.207 --> 08:32.076
     The boy had to be kind     
and thoughtful and a gentleman. 

08:32.078 --> 08:33.943
         How did Archie         
      ever pass that test?      

08:36.347 --> 08:39.950
        Well, Daddy died        
  a year before I met Archie.   

08:40.719 --> 08:41.952
                Ma, when you say

08:41.953 --> 08:44.989
      "Kind and thoughtful      
    and a gentleman,"           

08:44.991 --> 08:46.324
you're describing Lionel.       

08:51.029 --> 08:53.498
         I am, ain't I?         

08:53.500 --> 08:55.733
        Don't worry, Ma.        

08:55.735 --> 08:57.735
      Daddy will be asleep      
     when Linda comes home,     

08:57.737 --> 09:00.204
  and she's leaving tomorrow,   
      so he'll never know.      

09:02.007 --> 09:03.608
        I hope so.              

09:03.610 --> 09:05.909
     Well, I-- I better get     
        the dishes done.        

09:05.911 --> 09:08.012
          Oh, now, Ma, you sit  
          right there and relax.

09:08.014 --> 09:09.580
            Michael's gonna     
            do the dishes.      

09:09.582 --> 09:10.848
             What?              

09:10.850 --> 09:11.849
            I'm only kidding,   
            Michael.            

09:11.851 --> 09:12.916
                  I'll help you.

09:12.918 --> 09:14.318
All right, well,                
we'll do them together.         

09:14.320 --> 09:15.919
                 Yeah, you wash 
                 and I'll watch.

Archie,                         
it's your brother.

      Listen to this one.       

10:02.034 --> 10:06.671
    Why did the Irish farmer    
 spray booze on his vegetables? 

10:06.673 --> 10:07.905
          You give up?          

10:07.907 --> 10:09.373

19:57.396 --> 19:59.529
              You know what     
              I'm saying to you.

19:59.531 --> 20:01.231
                      I'm saying

20:01.233 --> 20:03.767
    that youse guys ought       
    to stick with yourselves.   

20:03.769 --> 20:05.235
         You mean guys          
    ought to stay with guys?    

20:10.941 --> 20:13.343
            You know            
what I'm talking about, Lionel. 

20:13.345 --> 20:16.012
     I'm saying that whites     
ought to stay with whites       

20:16.014 --> 20:19.315
          and coloreds          
  ought to stay with coloreds.  

20:26.891 --> 20:28.324
Look, Mr. Bunker,               

20:28.326 --> 20:29.926
it's been a year and a half now 

20:29.928 --> 20:31.495
         since we moved         
    into this neighborhood.     

20:31.497 --> 20:32.596
    I was just 19 then,         

20:32.598 --> 20:34.798
      and I got a big kick      
    out of you and me           

20:34.800 --> 20:36.366
        for a long time,        

20:36.368 --> 20:38.234
    but I'm pushing 21 now,     
      and I'm not getting       

20:38.236 --> 20:39.903
that big a kick out of it       
            anymore.            

20:39.905 --> 20:41.304
Put a lid on all of that.       

20:41.306 --> 20:43.072
No, no, wait, I'm not finished. 

20:43.074 --> 20:47.310
    Now, we've been friends,    
and we can go on being friends, 

20:47.312 --> 20:49.379
    but when it comes           
    to black and white          

20:49.381 --> 20:50.814
    and all the other           
    wonderful thoughts          

20:50.816 --> 20:53.283
      you have in between,      

20:53.285 --> 20:54.618
put a lid on that, Archie.      

20:57.555 --> 21:00.490
          Oh, wait a minute,    
          wait a minute, Lionel.

21:00.492 --> 21:01.658
          What went on in there?

21:01.660 --> 21:02.859
         What did he say to you?

21:02.861 --> 21:05.161
I got more                      
to say to you there.            

21:05.163 --> 21:07.898
I ain't got nothing more        
to say to you except this:      

21:07.900 --> 21:09.132
    It's your fault             

21:09.134 --> 21:10.500
  for raising that boy          
     so submissive.             

21:10.502 --> 21:13.202
              Don't you call    
              him "boy," Bunker!

21:13.204 --> 21:16.072
I don't mean "boy" boy.         

21:16.074 --> 21:17.407
         Wait a minute!

         What's everybody       
         getting so upset about?

21:19.678 --> 21:21.411
             I mean, so Lionel  
             and I went dancing.

21:21.413 --> 21:22.712
            It's no big deal.   

21:22.714 --> 21:24.180
     No big deal?               

21:24.182 --> 21:26.182
What would your father say      
if he heard about this?         

21:26.184 --> 21:27.818
        Well, Dad wouldn't mind.

21:27.820 --> 21:29.052
What a terrible thing to say    

21:29.054 --> 21:30.386
about your father               
and my brother!                 

21:30.388 --> 21:31.888
                It's true.      

21:31.890 --> 21:32.889

Don't tell me that.             

21:35.661 --> 21:37.260
You don't go out                
with no colored guys            

21:37.262 --> 21:39.295
when you live                   
in your father's house.         

21:39.297 --> 21:41.331
        You don't know anything 
        about my father's house.

                Daddy for years.

21:43.068 --> 21:48.705
    Uncle Archie, four kids     
    have grown up in that house,

21:48.707 --> 21:50.139
            and he's changed.   

21:50.141 --> 21:51.575
He ain't changed!               

21:51.577 --> 21:54.177
Since he was 8 years old,       
he always wanted to be like me, 

21:54.179 --> 21:56.179
and he was like me,             
and he's still like me!         

21:56.181 --> 21:57.647
              He's not like you!

21:57.649 --> 22:00.717
      He doesn't care what color
      a person's skin is,       

22:00.719 --> 22:03.386
            and he's not        
            8 years old anymore.

22:03.388 --> 22:05.254
         Your father sounds like

22:05.256 --> 22:06.490
      a great guy, Linda.       

22:06.492 --> 22:09.425
            He ain't so         
            great to me!        

22:09.427 --> 22:12.529
          Now, listen,          
  you got a lot to learn, boy.

    this is important.

          the races, let them.

              to keep ours pure.

         No more of that cream  
         into the coffee, right?

22:31.716 --> 22:33.617
Why don't you tell that         
to Mr. Bunker?                  

22:33.619 --> 22:35.218
You two got                     
a lot in common anyway.

to your uncle here.

22:40.025 --> 22:41.257
that he                         
made any sense.                 

22:41.259 --> 22:45.128
         Bunker, I got one thing
         to say to you.

          I want to talk to you.
