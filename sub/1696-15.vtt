WEBVTT

00:03.105 --> 00:05.835
Behind the ears.

00:05.908 --> 00:11.244
Over the ears. Ooh, I know.
One behind, one over. Oh, yeah!

00:14.950 --> 00:16.713
Hey, it's not that bad.

00:19.855 --> 00:22.016
Okay, all right, no ears.

00:22.391 --> 00:25.792
Lilly, this isn't about your ears.
I'm trying to tell you something.

00:26.261 --> 00:28.388
What, that your pants are on too tight?

00:29.064 --> 00:32.465
No. Guess what famous pop star
is playing Zaronda,

00:32.534 --> 00:35.002
Princess of the Undead,
on <i>Zombie High?</i>

00:35.070 --> 00:38.403
- Paula Abdul?
- No.

00:41.577 --> 00:44.569
- Hannah Montana!
- That is so cool!

00:44.680 --> 00:47.513
But, wait, you don't know how to act.

00:48.750 --> 00:51.344
What are you talking about?
I act every day.

00:51.420 --> 00:56.756
I act like I'm not Hannah Montana.
I act like Oliver's jokes are funny.

00:56.825 --> 01:00.226
Yesterday, I acted like
I liked that sweater you wore.

01:00.295 --> 01:01.455
What?

01:02.698 --> 01:04.256
Just kidding, I loved it!

01:04.333 --> 01:07.234
See? I was acting.

01:07.302 --> 01:08.633
Or was I?

01:10.339 --> 01:12.102
Ooh, you are good.

01:12.174 --> 01:14.335
Hey, do you have any scenes
with Jake Ryan?

01:14.409 --> 01:15.774
I haven't gotten the script yet.

01:15.878 --> 01:18.346
But I don't care. I get enough
of that egomaniac at school.

01:18.413 --> 01:21.314
Oh, come on. You so like Jake.

01:21.383 --> 01:23.351
No, I don't. How can you say that?

01:23.418 --> 01:25.045
Because every time
his name comes up,

01:25.153 --> 01:27.087
you act like you can't stand him.

01:27.189 --> 01:29.987
- That's not acting.
- Or is it?

01:30.058 --> 01:31.150
No!

01:31.994 --> 01:34.121
You're the only girl at school
who doesn't have a crush on him.

01:34.229 --> 01:37.824
Oh, please, I think people are starting
to see through his phony little game.

01:38.066 --> 01:40.534
Hey, ladies, please, no crowding.

01:41.670 --> 01:44.571
Sally, Wendy, Yolanda,
you know the rules,

01:44.673 --> 01:47.801
before noon only the names
that start with "A" through "L".

01:50.812 --> 01:52.040
Hey, have you guys heard?

01:52.147 --> 01:56.208
Sometime today Jake's gonna ask
one lucky girl to the '70s dance.

01:56.285 --> 01:57.547
As soon as he picks one,

01:57.619 --> 02:00.850
there will be 100 depressed girls
looking for a shoulder to cry on.

02:00.956 --> 02:03.891
Well, here it is,
broad and water absorbent.

02:06.461 --> 02:09.555
Look at him. It's disgusting.

02:09.664 --> 02:12.498
Come on, if he asks you to the dance,

02:12.567 --> 02:14.091
are you telling me
you wouldn't say yes?

02:14.169 --> 02:15.727
Yes.

02:15.804 --> 02:17.669
Yes, you'd say no
or yes, you'd say yes?

02:17.739 --> 02:19.502
No! Yes, I'd say no!

02:21.443 --> 02:24.003
Hey, Miley, you wanna go
to the '70s dance with me?

02:25.314 --> 02:26.872
- Yes.
Aw.

02:26.982 --> 02:29.883
- I mean no.
Yay!

02:30.185 --> 02:32.312
- No?
- Yes, I mean no.

02:32.421 --> 02:33.445
Huh?

02:33.522 --> 02:35.649
- Now you cheer.
Yay!

02:37.326 --> 02:38.315
- No?
- Yes.

02:38.427 --> 02:40.418
- Yes!
- No! Now stop that!

02:47.202 --> 02:48.533
<i> Come on!</i>

02:48.603 --> 02:50.696
<i>You get the limo out front</i>

02:52.708 --> 02:56.200
<i>Hottest styles, every shoe, every color</i>

02:56.278 --> 03:00.146
<i>Yeah, when you're famous</i>
<i>it can be kind of fun</i>

03:00.215 --> 03:04.982
<i>It's really you</i>
<i>but no one ever discovers</i>

03:05.053 --> 03:08.420
<i>Who would have thought</i>
<i>that a girl like me</i>

03:08.490 --> 03:13.860
<i>Would double as a superstar?</i>

03:13.929 --> 03:17.922
<i>You get the best of both worlds</i>

03:18.000 --> 03:19.695
<i>Chill it out, take it slow</i>

03:19.768 --> 03:21.497
<i>Then you rock out the show</i>

03:21.570 --> 03:25.336
<i>You get the best of both worlds</i>

03:26.008 --> 03:27.669
<i>Mix it all together</i>

03:27.776 --> 03:30.745
<i>And you know that</i>
<i>it's the best of both worlds</i>

03:37.185 --> 03:39.551
Lilly, look what I got.

03:39.654 --> 03:43.249
- Not now. Jake's about to change.
- Into what? A decent human being?

03:45.127 --> 03:47.857
No, he's going to take off
his rash guard.

03:47.929 --> 03:49.920
But, Lilly, I just got the script
for <i>Zombie High!</i>

03:49.998 --> 03:52.694
No way, let me see it!

03:55.137 --> 03:57.867
Oh, man! I missed his muscles.

03:57.973 --> 04:00.601
His zombie-slaying muscles.

04:01.209 --> 04:04.576
Lilly, build a bridge and get over it.

04:05.814 --> 04:08.783
Look at the title.
It's called "Forbidden Love".

04:08.850 --> 04:11.751
- I wonder if that's you!
- It better not be.

04:11.853 --> 04:14.651
- Hey. What's up?
- Nothing. Just a magazine.

04:14.723 --> 04:16.748
- What?
- Nothing. Hi.

04:18.894 --> 04:20.088
Listen, about the dance.

04:20.161 --> 04:22.027
You, uh, seemed really nervous
when I asked you,

04:22.130 --> 04:25.861
which is to be expected,
'cause, you know, look at me.

04:25.967 --> 04:28.834
I do. All the time.

04:28.937 --> 04:31.599
Even when you don't know I am.
Did I say that out loud?

04:31.673 --> 04:32.799
Yes.

04:33.809 --> 04:37.404
I wanted to give you a second chance.
So, you want to go with me?

04:37.479 --> 04:40.414
Jake, I wasn't nervous then
and I'm not nervous now.

04:40.482 --> 04:42.143
I just don't wanna go
to the dance with you.

04:42.217 --> 04:43.878
Okay, so that's a no?

04:43.952 --> 04:45.078
- Yes.
- Yes?

04:45.153 --> 04:46.882
No. Now stop that.

04:48.356 --> 04:51.917
Okay. I just want you to know
that I'm shooting an episode

04:51.993 --> 04:55.656
with Hannah Montana this weekend,
and even though I'll be kissing her,

04:55.764 --> 04:57.755
I'll be thinking of you.

04:58.967 --> 05:03.904
- Oh, my God! Jake! I love you!
- You are so amazing!

05:06.441 --> 05:08.204
Can you believe that guy?

05:08.276 --> 05:11.507
Trying to make me jealous by saying
he's gonna be kissing Hannah Montana.

05:11.613 --> 05:13.080
Wait a minute!

05:15.150 --> 05:17.084
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes!

05:17.152 --> 05:18.483
This is horrible.

05:18.553 --> 05:21.181
Not only do I have to kiss him,
but my lips fall off.

05:21.590 --> 05:25.686
No, it's okay.
See, he reattaches them with his love.

05:25.794 --> 05:27.853
- Aw!
- Ew.

05:33.468 --> 05:36.096
- Hey, Dad. What you got there?
- Birthday present for Uncle Earl.

05:36.304 --> 05:38.932
- Ooh, cool, can I see?
- Son, don't open it.

05:39.040 --> 05:40.132
Don't open that!

05:41.843 --> 05:44.539
Turn it off, turn it off!

05:44.613 --> 05:47.548
Three, two, one.

05:51.019 --> 05:53.010
What is wrong with you?

05:54.222 --> 05:56.816
I'm sorry, Son. I told you not to open it.

05:57.425 --> 06:00.451
You know how your Uncle Earl always
sends me a prank for my birthday?

06:00.529 --> 06:05.159
Well, this year I decided it was time
for a little vacuum-packed payback.

06:05.600 --> 06:06.897
Cool, can I get in on it?

06:06.968 --> 06:10.131
Oh, Son, no offense,
but this game's for the big boys.

06:10.205 --> 06:12.765
Your Uncle Earl's one
of the all-time great pranksters.

06:12.841 --> 06:15.275
- No.
- I think you should just stay out of it.

06:15.343 --> 06:17.607
- I wouldn't want you to get hurt.
- Are you saying

06:17.679 --> 06:20.307
you don't think I have what it takes
to put one over on Uncle Earl?

06:20.382 --> 06:24.409
Son, you couldn't even
put one over on your old man.

06:24.486 --> 06:28.820
Gee, Dad, I guess you're right.
We'll see you later.

06:30.091 --> 06:33.686
- Jackson, I know that look.
- What look?

06:35.130 --> 06:36.256
Bye.

06:38.567 --> 06:41.434
Something tells me
this ain't gonna be pretty.

06:41.503 --> 06:43.300
But it might be fun.

06:49.611 --> 06:55.140
Hi, Hannah, I'm Roger, your director.
Big fan, big fan. You look horrible.

06:56.618 --> 06:58.176
It's fantastic!

06:59.754 --> 07:02.655
Listen, I've been thinking
about the script

07:02.724 --> 07:06.421
- and I've just got one little problem.
- Oh, boy.

07:06.494 --> 07:08.428
No, it's just a little thing.

07:08.496 --> 07:11.897
See, do I really have to kiss
that zombie slayer?

07:13.768 --> 07:19.104
Well, since the divine prophecy states
that only by reawakening the cold,

07:19.174 --> 07:21.142
dead heart of the princess

07:21.209 --> 07:24.007
can the slayer rout the forces
of darkness and save the world

07:24.112 --> 07:26.171
from ultimate destruction,

07:26.248 --> 07:28.739
I'm gonna have to say yes, you do.

07:28.817 --> 07:31.217
But why does he always
have to save the world?

07:31.286 --> 07:34.585
I mean, can't his faithful sidekick
Demon Dog save it this week?

07:34.656 --> 07:37.921
I would rather plant one on the pooch.

07:38.927 --> 07:40.451
Interesting idea.

07:40.528 --> 07:43.122
I'll mention it to the writers.
But for right now, try to have fun.

07:43.231 --> 07:46.598
And remember, all of us here,
big fans, big fans.

07:48.670 --> 07:52.538
Looks like we've got another diva
guest star. Turn on the charm.

07:52.607 --> 07:56.976
- She's a little nervous about the kiss.
- Aren't they all? I mean, look at me.

07:58.480 --> 08:01.881
Yeah, you're beautiful.
Big fan, big fan. Just do it.

08:04.486 --> 08:07.387
Hi, Hannah, I'm Jake Ryan.

08:07.455 --> 08:09.719
We're thrilled to have you
on the show this week.

08:09.824 --> 08:13.658
Yeah. It's gonna be
real interesting for me too.

08:14.162 --> 08:15.925
So, what do you think of the script?

08:16.331 --> 08:20.961
Well, I love everything
except page forty-one.

08:21.636 --> 08:23.160
Oh, the kiss.

08:23.238 --> 08:24.967
Yeah, nothing personal, buddy, but...

08:25.040 --> 08:28.669
Man, this is not my week.

08:28.777 --> 08:32.235
I mean, first, this girl I like
won't go to the school dance with me

08:32.313 --> 08:34.714
and now my zombie princess
won't kiss me.

08:34.816 --> 08:38.251
Yeah, well, I just don't think
that the zombie princess would...

08:38.320 --> 08:40.413
Who's this girl at school?

08:41.556 --> 08:45.583
- Her name's Miley.
- Wow. What an interesting name.

08:45.694 --> 08:49.755
I've never heard anything like it.
She must be really unique.

08:49.831 --> 08:53.597
She is.
She's cute and funny and smart.

08:53.702 --> 08:56.637
She's so down-to-earth.
And when I talk to her,

08:56.738 --> 08:59.036
it doesn't feel like she's talking
to Jake Ryan the celebrity,

08:59.140 --> 09:01.631
but she's talking
to Jake Ryan the person.

09:01.710 --> 09:05.510
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah, I do.

09:05.613 --> 09:08.309
Sometimes you need to know
that people like you for who you are

09:08.416 --> 09:10.907
- and not just because you're a star.
- Exactly!

09:11.019 --> 09:14.955
And she doesn't like me as a star
or a person. Isn't that great?

09:15.890 --> 09:18.358
Is this a trick question?

09:18.526 --> 09:20.619
No, it's just...

09:20.729 --> 09:22.788
It's something new to me.

09:24.599 --> 09:28.365
Look, I'm really sorry I'm dumping
all this on you, it's just...

09:28.436 --> 09:30.370
I can't stop thinking about her.

09:31.172 --> 09:32.799
Really?

09:33.174 --> 09:36.109
Well, I guess I'm just gonna
have to forget about it.

09:36.211 --> 09:40.545
Oh, yeah, right,
I suppose forgetting about her's good.

09:40.648 --> 09:43.242
So, back to the kiss.
Don't worry about it, all right?

09:43.318 --> 09:47.516
Just close your eyes and count to sixty.
It'll be over before you know it.

09:47.589 --> 09:50.023
- Sixty?
Places!

09:51.126 --> 09:53.219
Hope you like thunder mint.

09:58.933 --> 10:02.869
Darling, in three and a half miles,
you are all mine.

10:04.372 --> 10:06.306
Maybe just three.

10:07.842 --> 10:09.673
What the heck.

10:09.744 --> 10:11.644
How about I just jog
down to the end of the driveway,

10:11.713 --> 10:14.341
get the mail and be right back.

10:18.520 --> 10:19.885
Come to papa.

10:20.388 --> 10:21.480
Booyah!

10:22.724 --> 10:25.192
Boy, I could use a glass of milk.

10:25.293 --> 10:27.454
Your life is about to get
real interesting, Son.

10:29.564 --> 10:32.795
Zombie High bathroom.
Take one! Action!

10:32.867 --> 10:37.270
- You have betrayed us, Zaronda!
- No! The slayer is lying to you!

10:37.372 --> 10:40.500
I saw the two of you
with my own dead eyes!

10:40.608 --> 10:43.907
- Oh, you know what this means?
- No, not the third stall!

10:43.978 --> 10:47.345
Not the portal to the underworld! No!

10:49.317 --> 10:51.683
Dudes! I slayed you once,

10:51.753 --> 10:54.483
looks like I'm gonna
have to slay you again.

10:58.000 --> 11:04.074

11:17.445 --> 11:20.778
Flush twice, it's a long way down.

11:23.184 --> 11:26.585
Oh, Zaronda! Are you okay?

11:26.654 --> 11:29.248
For a dead girl, I've never felt so alive.

11:29.524 --> 11:34.826
- Then why did you run away from me?
- Don't you see? Our love is forbidden.

11:34.896 --> 11:37.160
We can never be together.

11:37.632 --> 11:40.897
Then maybe this will change
your mind.

11:44.739 --> 11:46.468
<i>He really is cute. </i>

11:46.541 --> 11:48.941
<i>And he thinks I'm cute</i>
<i>and down-to-earth. </i>

11:49.043 --> 11:53.343
<i>Oh, stop it, Miley, you don't like him. </i>
<i>Oh, who am I kidding, yes, I do. </i>

11:53.414 --> 11:55.939
<i>And that thunder mint... Wow!</i>

11:57.752 --> 12:00.016
Cut! That's lunch!

12:00.121 --> 12:02.589
What? Wait, wait, wait!
What about the kiss?

12:02.657 --> 12:04.750
I thought about it and you're right.

12:04.826 --> 12:07.488
We'll see how the audience
feels about the relationship first,

12:07.595 --> 12:09.324
- then bring you back.
- But...

12:09.430 --> 12:12.456
In the meantime, after lunch,
we'll try that kiss with Demon Dog.

12:12.534 --> 12:13.694
What?

12:16.170 --> 12:19.571
Hope you don't mind the taste of
kibble and gravy. He is a messy eater.

12:21.009 --> 12:25.776
Hey! Don't listen to me.
Aren't you the director? Be a man.

12:27.348 --> 12:30.511
Wow, Hannah, you were
really great in that scene.

12:30.585 --> 12:32.746
You looked like you
really wanted to kiss me.

12:32.820 --> 12:35.618
Yeah,
well, it's called acting!

12:38.026 --> 12:40.859
You better brush them good
if you're gonna be kissing me.

12:49.938 --> 12:52.202
Lilly, I've been calling you all morning!

12:52.307 --> 12:54.605
Why haven't you been
answering your cell phone?

12:54.709 --> 12:57.678
My dad took it away
after my last Biology quiz.

12:57.745 --> 13:01.977
Who knew photosynthesis
had nothing to do with photography?

13:02.350 --> 13:03.578
Everyone.

13:04.152 --> 13:06.882
Now do you want to hear
about <i>Zombie High</i> or not?

13:06.988 --> 13:10.754
Yes, yes, yes! Tell me everything! But
start with the kiss! How was the kiss?

13:10.825 --> 13:12.850
- Wet and kibbly.
- Ew.

13:12.927 --> 13:15.521
Yeah. I ended up kissing Demon Dog.

13:18.299 --> 13:21.097
Anyhoo, that's not what I wanted
to tell you. It's about Jake.

13:21.169 --> 13:23.569
- I realized that I actually...
- Hey, guys.

13:23.671 --> 13:26.139
- Oh, Jake. Hi.
- S'up?

13:26.207 --> 13:28.266
Okay, Jake, about the dance thing...

13:28.343 --> 13:31.403
Don't worry, Miley. I'm not gonna
ask you again. I've learned my lesson.

13:31.512 --> 13:35.448
- Oh, really, because I realized that...
- That I should move on, I know. I know.

13:35.550 --> 13:38.348
That's why I came over here
to ask Lilly.

13:40.788 --> 13:41.812
Do you wanna go
to the '70s dance with me?

13:41.889 --> 13:42.947
What?

13:43.024 --> 13:44.616
- Yes.
- Huh?

13:44.692 --> 13:47.058
Cool. I'll call you with the deets.

13:48.463 --> 13:51.261
<i>I'm going to the dance with Jake</i>
<i>I'm going to the dance with Jake</i>

13:51.332 --> 13:53.232
<i>Why aren't you happy dancing?</i>

13:53.301 --> 13:55.132
Why aren't you happy dancing?

13:55.236 --> 13:58.603
- Because I like Jake.
- Since when?

13:58.940 --> 14:01.875
Since he saved me from going through
the portal to the underworld.

14:01.943 --> 14:05.242
Those kinds of things make you
realize what's important in life.

14:05.980 --> 14:08.949
But ever since the day he got here,
all I've heard from you is,

14:09.017 --> 14:13.010
"Oh, he's so stuck-up,"
and, "Oh, who does he think he is?"

14:13.087 --> 14:16.056
- Yeah, well, I changed my mind.
- Yeah, right after he asked me.

14:16.357 --> 14:17.824
No. Actually, last night,

14:17.892 --> 14:20.190
which you would've known
if you would've had your cell phone.

14:20.261 --> 14:23.230
Photosynthesis! I mean, come on!

14:23.998 --> 14:26.933
- How is this my fault?
- It's not.

14:27.001 --> 14:29.936
Tell Jake that you can't go to the dance
and everything will be fine.

14:30.004 --> 14:32.495
But I don't want to tell him that.

14:33.775 --> 14:37.006
But he likes me.
He only asked you 'cause I said no.

14:40.548 --> 14:42.812
So, what are you saying?

14:43.618 --> 14:45.347
That I'm the canned fruit cup you get

14:45.420 --> 14:47.547
when they're all out
of the chocolate pudding?

14:47.855 --> 14:49.846
- What?
- You know what I mean.

14:49.924 --> 14:53.416
Well, I've got news for you.
The Jake ship has sailed.

14:55.930 --> 14:57.761
And you're not on it.

14:59.701 --> 15:02.363
- I'm in a first-class cabin.
- Just leave mad already!

15:02.470 --> 15:03.732
Happily!

15:04.739 --> 15:07.708
- My house is this way!
- My house is that way!

15:19.287 --> 15:22.415
Morning, Son.
You sure are a heavy sleeper.

15:24.292 --> 15:27.022
Well, I'm gonna get you for this!

15:30.364 --> 15:32.161
What the...

15:42.610 --> 15:45.773
What's wrong, Dad?
You look a little down.

15:46.380 --> 15:48.245
Good job, Son.

15:48.349 --> 15:52.843
Now. Let me give you
a little hug, okay?

15:52.954 --> 15:54.854
Oh, no.
You stay away from me, sticky man.

15:54.922 --> 15:59.018
Oh, no, let me give you
a little low-fat raspberry love.

15:59.260 --> 16:00.488
Bye-bye.

16:00.561 --> 16:06.261
Oh. Before digital photography,
that would've taken me a week to paint.

16:06.334 --> 16:08.734
Gotta love the progress.

16:13.207 --> 16:15.835
That was a good one, Dad.
That was a good one.

16:16.644 --> 16:18.339
Now give me a hug.

16:18.412 --> 16:21.245
Oh, no.
Get away from me, pudding boy.

16:22.450 --> 16:23.644
- Come on.
- Get away from me.

16:23.751 --> 16:26.311
Come here. Give me a hug.

16:29.524 --> 16:30.650
Daddy!

16:36.531 --> 16:39.056
<i>That was The Miami Funk Corporation</i>

16:39.133 --> 16:42.899
<i>with</i> The Groove is Gonna Getcha,
Shoogie Oogie Oogie.

16:45.640 --> 16:48.837
- I'm having a great time.
- Me, too.

16:48.943 --> 16:50.376
Hey, you know, that reminds me.

16:50.444 --> 16:52.275
There's something
I've been wanting to do all night.

16:52.380 --> 16:54.007
Really? Oh, boy.

17:01.989 --> 17:05.857
Just stretching my lips.
I heard the punch is tart.

17:09.329 --> 17:11.457
Hey, disco man,
mind if I borrow your mike?

17:11.531 --> 17:14.797
Dude, are you kidding?
Just let me do a quick intro.

17:14.902 --> 17:18.303
<i>All you superfly guys,</i>
<i>and you foxy ladies,</i>

17:18.372 --> 17:22.001
<i>it gives me great pleasure</i>
<i>to introduce a living legend,</i>

17:22.108 --> 17:25.135
<i>a star for the ages,</i>
<i>the King of Funkytown. </i>

17:25.213 --> 17:28.580
Yo, Oliver, before the semester ends.

17:28.649 --> 17:30.879
<i>And my close personal friend,</i>
<i> Jake Ryan. </i>

17:30.985 --> 17:32.646
<i>Who says I'm the second coolest guy</i>
<i>at school. </i>

17:35.323 --> 17:36.813
<i>Thanks, everybody. </i>

17:36.891 --> 17:39.451
<i>I just want to say how happy I am</i>
<i>to be part of a school</i>

17:39.527 --> 17:42.860
<i>where everybody is so nice and alive. </i>

17:48.603 --> 17:50.127
- Dude.
- Sorry.

17:52.340 --> 17:55.503
<i>Anyway, I want to dedicate this song</i>
<i>to all the friends I've made here</i>

17:55.576 --> 17:58.170
<i>and one very special friend. </i>

18:01.382 --> 18:03.350
Hey, y'all. What's up?

18:03.417 --> 18:05.476
- Whoa.
Whoa.

18:09.123 --> 18:11.614
What are you doing?
You're supposed to be at a '70s dance,

18:11.692 --> 18:13.557
not turning letters on a game show.

18:13.661 --> 18:17.529
Oh, my goodness, I completely forgot.
I hope I don't stand out.

18:17.598 --> 18:20.328
I know exactly what you're doing.
You're trying to get Jake to notice you.

18:20.401 --> 18:23.370
No, I'm not. Oh. Hi, Jake.

18:23.437 --> 18:25.371
Hi, Miley. You look great.

18:25.439 --> 18:28.203
Really? I think she looks
like a fire truck.

18:29.176 --> 18:30.734
A very cute fire truck.

18:30.945 --> 18:35.245
Hey, less talkie, more dancie.
Oliver! Let's get this party started now!

18:56.370 --> 19:00.363
<i>Whoo! Looks like somebody's</i>
<i>trying to bump up the party. </i>

19:00.441 --> 19:02.568
<i>Everybody's doing the bump. </i>

19:04.078 --> 19:06.546
Girls, please put the claws away.

19:07.682 --> 19:10.515
- Stay out of this, Jake!
- Yeah, we're fighting over you.

19:10.618 --> 19:13.314
- Knock it off, he's my date!
- Yeah, well, he asked me first!

19:15.056 --> 19:18.116
You said no, three times!
Forgive me for thinking that meant no.

19:18.225 --> 19:20.125
Hey. Well, you're forgiven.

19:20.528 --> 19:22.257
- Chocolate pudding!
- Fruit cup!

19:22.330 --> 19:25.697
Wait. Celebrity in pain.

19:38.346 --> 19:41.611
Congratulations. You made me
look ridiculous in front of Jake.

19:41.682 --> 19:43.980
Oh, yeah? Look what you did to me.

19:44.051 --> 19:46.383
I'm not the one trying to
steal someone else's date.

19:46.454 --> 19:49.446
- How could you do that to me?
- I don't know.

19:49.523 --> 19:52.287
I mean, it was Jake

19:54.362 --> 19:56.523
and he's just so cute.

19:56.597 --> 19:59.122
And that thunder mint.

19:59.200 --> 20:02.795
Wow, and I kissed a dog.
I think I deserved it!

20:04.438 --> 20:06.872
Well, you can have him.
I don't like him that much, anyway.

20:06.941 --> 20:09.705
- Since when?
- Since...

20:11.012 --> 20:13.378
Since I saw the way he looked at you.

20:14.548 --> 20:19.383
- Lilly, I mean, I just...
- Forget it. Easy come, easy go.

20:19.487 --> 20:23.514
You go back out there.
I'll just rinse the sherbet out of my wig.

20:24.592 --> 20:26.822
- You gonna be okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

20:29.130 --> 20:33.658
- Lilly.
- It's nothing. I'm just rinsing my wig.

20:34.301 --> 20:36.269
With my tears.

20:37.505 --> 20:38.802
Why aren't you leaving?

20:38.873 --> 20:43.105
Because I hurt my best friend
over some guy.

20:43.210 --> 20:47.374
And nobody, not even Jake Ryan,
is worth that.

20:47.481 --> 20:50.382
- I'm sorry, Lilly.
- You should be.

20:52.053 --> 20:55.511
- Ew. You smell really bad.
- You smell really bad, too.

20:59.126 --> 21:01.856
- Hey, you two okay?
- Yeah. We're fine.

21:01.962 --> 21:03.452
Yeah, we talked. We worked it all out.

21:03.564 --> 21:06.829
Sorry, Jake, I'm not into you anymore.

21:06.901 --> 21:09.495
That's cool. So, Miley,

21:09.603 --> 21:11.298
- you want to dance?
- No, thanks.

21:11.405 --> 21:13.999
I'm gonna dance with my best friend.

21:14.341 --> 21:18.004
Whatever. So who wants to do
the Hustle with Jake Ryan?

21:21.082 --> 21:24.540
- I don't know what they see in him.
- Neither do I.

21:24.618 --> 21:27.746
- Good thing we're over him.
- Oh, yeah.

21:46.073 --> 21:48.439
Hey, Jackson, get up
and get me a soda, would you?

21:48.509 --> 21:49.908
Yeah, sure.

21:50.010 --> 21:52.069
I go open the refrigerator
and a monkey pops out

21:52.146 --> 21:55.707
and hits me over the head
with a banana.

21:55.783 --> 21:59.310
- You want a drink, you go get it.
- Oh, no. I see what you're doing.

21:59.386 --> 22:01.513
Turn it around so I get up
and open up the fridge

22:01.589 --> 22:04.319
and a monkey hits me
in the face with a pie.

22:04.391 --> 22:06.518
A- ha! So there is a monkey!

22:12.867 --> 22:16.735
- Oh, no, man. I'm not getting it.
- Neither am I.

22:16.837 --> 22:19.032
Let the monkey get it.

22:22.510 --> 22:25.445
Well, maybe there's a ten million
dollar winner at the next house.

22:25.513 --> 22:27.037
Come on, guys.
