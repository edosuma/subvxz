WEBVTT

01:01.746 --> 01:03.616
Captain Thomas Magnum,

01:03.681 --> 01:07.688
I'd like you to meet Lieutenant
Commander, Thomas Magnum,

01:07.752 --> 01:09.088
your grandson.

01:10.155 --> 01:11.658
Last on Magnum.

01:11.724 --> 01:13.159
Why'd you leave the Navy?

01:14.493 --> 01:15.595
Well, it's a...

01:15.661 --> 01:18.065
it's a bit of a drive
back to my hotel.

01:19.098 --> 01:20.701
Dear Thomas,

01:20.766 --> 01:23.973
as I wríte thís letter, I pray to
God that you wíll never read ít.

01:24.437 --> 01:26.641
For íf you do, ít means that
somethíng has happened

01:26.705 --> 01:29.410
to separate me
from Líly forever.

01:29.475 --> 01:34.385
But íf that should happen, ít ís ímperatíve
that she be reuníted wíth her father.

01:34.448 --> 01:35.683
You are that man, Thomas.

01:36.383 --> 01:38.820
I thínk you
always knew you were.

01:38.885 --> 01:41.958
Please take care of her
and of you.

01:42.023 --> 01:44.728
I always loved you, Míchelle.

01:46.727 --> 01:47.795
Michelle

01:49.530 --> 01:51.500
wanted me to know that Lily

01:52.967 --> 01:54.470
is my daughter.

02:05.747 --> 02:09.488
Do you think being a private investigator
is just an excuse not to grow up?

02:09.550 --> 02:11.053
No. Not really.

02:11.120 --> 02:12.121
No way!

02:13.755 --> 02:15.916
I'm sorry to interrupt your vacation...
I'll be outside.

02:15.925 --> 02:18.462
But I've just received
a call from Linda Lee Ellison.

02:18.527 --> 02:21.432
She's a television reporter you
dated last year for a short time.

02:21.498 --> 02:23.234
Higgins, I know who I dated.

02:23.298 --> 02:25.970
Then perhaps you also know
that she's in the hospital.

02:26.035 --> 02:27.371
Someone tríed to kíll her.

02:28.404 --> 02:29.706
You came back?

02:29.772 --> 02:31.542
Well, when somebody
tries to kill somebody,

02:31.608 --> 02:36.017
I just automatically jump
on a plane and come home.

02:36.080 --> 02:37.515
It's kind of
a bad habit of mine.

02:37.748 --> 02:40.520
Hí, Líly. Líly!

02:41.886 --> 02:43.422
There. Maggie,

02:44.121 --> 02:46.860
she said, "Búp bê."

02:46.924 --> 02:48.962
That is "doll" in Vietnamese.

02:50.461 --> 02:52.565
No, Líly, there's no tíme.

02:57.536 --> 02:59.806
That is the sound of
a car door opening.

02:59.871 --> 03:02.142
It's been positively identified.

03:02.208 --> 03:03.978
Lily got out of the car.

03:06.946 --> 03:09.383
She went to get her doll.

03:09.447 --> 03:12.119
Maggie, she's alive somewhere.

03:12.451 --> 03:14.521
I feel it.

03:23.997 --> 03:25.199
Somebody's trying to kill me!

03:25.255 --> 03:26.825
He has a knife!

04:52.995 --> 04:55.265
Your letter of resignation?

04:55.330 --> 04:56.331
Yes.

04:58.668 --> 05:00.170
When will you be leaving?

05:00.235 --> 05:01.236
Right after the wedding.

05:01.303 --> 05:04.910
And I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't
mention it to anyone until then.

05:04.974 --> 05:06.777
Now, Higgins, the problem is...

05:06.843 --> 05:08.580
You're still upset
about the tape.

05:08.644 --> 05:10.714
What? The video tape.

05:10.780 --> 05:12.083
I owe you an apology, Magnum.

05:12.148 --> 05:13.583
I'd hoped to make it before now,

05:13.649 --> 05:15.285
but with all
the wedding preparations...

05:15.351 --> 05:16.620
No, Higgins, believe me.

05:16.687 --> 05:18.423
Well, if there's some other
way I can prove to you

05:18.489 --> 05:21.528
that my intentions, however misguided,
were nonetheless honorable.

05:21.592 --> 05:23.896
Higgins, please.
I know they were.

05:23.961 --> 05:25.497
That is not why I'm resigning.

05:25.562 --> 05:26.697
It's not?

05:26.764 --> 05:27.832
No.

05:27.899 --> 05:29.735
Now, the problem is...

05:29.801 --> 05:32.305
Jonathan! Jonathan!

05:32.369 --> 05:35.108
Oh! Mr. Magnum,
I hope I'm not interrupting.

05:35.172 --> 05:37.109
Jonathan, the caterer is here,

05:37.174 --> 05:40.314
and I believe his table
count is dreadfully low.

05:40.378 --> 05:41.546
I'll be right there.

05:41.613 --> 05:42.815
Thank you.

05:45.383 --> 05:47.520
So, the problem is...

05:47.585 --> 05:51.794
Well if it's not the tape, then
why this impetuous decision?

05:51.857 --> 05:53.894
It's not an impetuous
decision, Higgins.

05:53.959 --> 05:55.629
I've been thinking about
making some changes.

05:55.694 --> 05:56.929
I was going to tell you
yesterday,

05:56.996 --> 05:59.034
but I decided, knowing you,

05:59.099 --> 06:01.938
that it would be better to do
this a little more formally.

06:02.002 --> 06:03.237
Well wha♪ are you going to do?

06:03.302 --> 06:04.672
I can't tell you that. Why not?

06:04.738 --> 06:05.778
It's part of the surprise.

06:05.806 --> 06:08.410
Does this have anything to do with
those papers you were reading?

06:08.475 --> 06:11.714
Yes. Well, no.

06:11.778 --> 06:15.852
Well, yes and no. I told you,
Higgins, it's a surprise.

06:17.150 --> 06:19.087
Good. Thomas, you're here. I've
been looking all over for you.

06:19.152 --> 06:20.354
Hi, Higgins.

06:20.420 --> 06:23.101
Emile said that you have not been
measured for your morning coat yet.

06:23.156 --> 06:25.126
And don't put it off till the last minute.
Don't worry about it.

06:25.192 --> 06:26.294
It's taken care of.
It's taken care of?

06:26.359 --> 06:27.528
Does that mean
you've seen Emile?

06:27.595 --> 06:29.130
No, I mean,
I'll take care of it.

06:29.196 --> 06:30.232
Thomas, look, I know you.

06:30.298 --> 06:32.000
You'll be running around like
a chicken without his head

06:32.067 --> 06:34.371
before the wedding,
looking for his phone number.

06:34.435 --> 06:36.205
Rickey, can I see you
for a second?

06:36.270 --> 06:38.273
I'll be right there, babe.
Hi, Cleo, how are you doing?

06:38.339 --> 06:41.411
Well all things considered, it's a
little crazy, but it's going great.

06:41.477 --> 06:42.812
Oh, that's great. Thomas,
please take care of this.

06:42.878 --> 06:45.984
Remember, 8:30 at Mario's,
and don't be late.

06:48.750 --> 06:50.153
So,

06:51.453 --> 06:53.723
the problem is, Higgins,

06:53.790 --> 06:57.096
I knew who to give my letter
of resignation to.

06:57.961 --> 06:59.063
You.

07:00.430 --> 07:02.901
I just didn't know
who to address it to.

07:02.966 --> 07:04.703
Jonathan Quayle Higgins

07:07.370 --> 07:08.940
or Robin Masters.

07:12.076 --> 07:14.848
Oh, come on, Higgins.
I'm leaving.

07:14.912 --> 07:16.047
Forever.

07:16.113 --> 07:19.386
What possible difference could it
make if you tell me the truth?

07:20.317 --> 07:22.721
Are you or are you not
Robin Masters?

07:42.641 --> 07:43.844
Yes.

07:45.211 --> 07:46.212
Yes? Yes.

07:46.278 --> 07:47.446
Yes?

07:49.314 --> 07:52.554
I knew it! I knew it!
I knew I was right!

07:53.819 --> 07:55.656
Well? Well, what?

07:55.721 --> 07:57.691
Well, you're Robin Masters, and?

07:57.757 --> 07:58.825
And,

08:00.160 --> 08:02.965
I regretfully accept
your resignation.

08:05.032 --> 08:06.334
That's it?

08:08.302 --> 08:11.207
"Yes, I'm Robin Masters," and

08:12.339 --> 08:13.340
that's it?

08:13.407 --> 08:15.210
You asked for an answer,
I gave it to you.

08:15.275 --> 08:16.878
What else is there to say?

08:17.812 --> 08:22.387
Well, you could start with why such an
elaborate scheme to hide your real identity.

08:22.450 --> 08:26.023
Why did you feel it was necessary to
pretend that you aren't Robin Masters?

08:26.087 --> 08:27.623
Or that he isn't you?

08:27.689 --> 08:29.659
I think you at least owe me
that much of an explanation.

08:29.724 --> 08:33.597
Mr. Higgins, it is very important
that you order the flowers today,

08:33.660 --> 08:36.400
otherwise, I cannot insure
their timely arrival.

08:41.337 --> 08:42.472
Tradition.

08:44.306 --> 08:48.247
Tradition? Tradition.
An excellent choice.

08:48.310 --> 08:52.117
Oh, I think we can accommodate
your theme quite nicely.

08:52.182 --> 08:55.656
Actually, I wasn't talking to you,
however, let me see what you have.

08:57.087 --> 08:58.690
Tradition?

09:23.865 --> 09:25.401
Fantastic, isn't it?

09:25.468 --> 09:27.271
Fantastic. Yes. Quite.

09:27.336 --> 09:30.408
I can't believe you guys threw
this swell party for me.

09:32.008 --> 09:33.945
You made all the arrangements.

09:38.180 --> 09:39.683
Hi, guys. Sorry I'm late.

09:39.749 --> 09:41.986
Hey, what was the name of that woman
you met down on the street here,

09:42.052 --> 09:43.521
last year on your fortieth?

09:43.587 --> 09:45.524
Linda Lee Ellison.

09:45.589 --> 09:47.392
Now that you're here.

09:51.128 --> 09:54.435
To Rick, as you enter
that final DMZ,

09:54.499 --> 09:58.340
we want you to know that your
combat unit is behind you 100O_.

09:58.403 --> 10:01.442
So go get them, buddy!
And make the Marines proud!

10:01.506 --> 10:03.142
Here, here. Here, here.

10:03.207 --> 10:04.977
Thanks, T.C.

10:05.043 --> 10:06.746
Sorry. No problem.

10:07.979 --> 10:10.351
If you are Robin Masters...

10:10.416 --> 10:14.490
Well, if I might, I would like
to add my congratulations.

10:14.553 --> 10:15.922
To Rick and Cleo.

10:15.988 --> 10:18.993
May you have all the happiness
you so richly deserve.

10:19.058 --> 10:20.593
Here, here.

10:20.659 --> 10:22.529
- Thanks, Higgins.
- You're quite welcome.

10:31.371 --> 10:35.345
Me? I'm sorry. I didn't
know we were all gonna...

10:35.408 --> 10:39.149
Okay, Rick, we've been
through a lot together,

10:39.212 --> 10:41.382
and I just wanted you to know

10:41.448 --> 10:44.454
that I don't think you could've chosen
a better woman to love than Cleo.

10:44.518 --> 10:47.957
Here, here. I don't mean
love in the physical sense.

10:48.021 --> 10:51.194
Although,
I'm sure that Cleo is...

10:51.992 --> 10:54.329
No, no. I'm not sure at all.

10:54.395 --> 10:56.395
In fact, I don't know anything
about that part of...

10:56.430 --> 10:57.699
What I mean to say is...

10:57.766 --> 10:59.034
ls what?

11:01.403 --> 11:05.377
Rick, let's just settle this
thing once and for all.

11:05.440 --> 11:07.844
Nothing happened
between me and Cleo.

11:07.909 --> 11:11.716
I mean we were on a couple of long
surveillances together, but that's it.

11:11.781 --> 11:13.784
Cleo is a wonderful woman.

11:13.849 --> 11:18.023
Hey, guy, do you know Cleo? She's
the hottest number in town.

11:18.086 --> 11:19.489
That does it!

11:23.059 --> 11:24.828
Nobody talks about
my fiance that way!

11:24.894 --> 11:26.529
Nobody!

11:26.596 --> 11:29.234
Why you little pissant!

11:32.368 --> 11:35.341
Look, my friend tends
to fly off the handle.

11:35.405 --> 11:36.940
He didn't mean to...

11:40.811 --> 11:43.918
Oh, what the hell!

11:48.018 --> 11:49.019
I think we're in trouble.

11:49.086 --> 11:51.056
Perhaps I should handle this.

11:51.121 --> 11:53.091
You see, sir,
the fact is that our...

12:17.616 --> 12:18.752
Higgins.

13:42.874 --> 13:44.209
What happened?

13:47.946 --> 13:49.983
What happened? You...

13:52.284 --> 13:54.054
I'll tell you what happened.

13:54.552 --> 13:57.057
Boy, you were a tiger in there.
You know...

13:57.656 --> 13:58.657
You know,
when you lose your temper,

13:58.724 --> 14:01.663
you don't even know
your own strength.

14:01.727 --> 14:04.699
By God, men, we were all tigers.

14:04.964 --> 14:06.367
Really? Yeah.

14:06.432 --> 14:08.636
We won't be able to go
back in there for a while.

14:09.835 --> 14:11.138
I know another place we can go.

14:11.203 --> 14:12.238
Lead the way.

14:12.305 --> 14:14.142
Boy we showed them, huh, guys?

14:15.608 --> 14:20.952
The last time I enjoyed such camaraderie
in battle was just before D-Day.

14:21.013 --> 14:23.985
A battle we called
Operation Hambone.

14:25.552 --> 14:28.324
Oh, forget it.
That's a stupid story.

14:28.890 --> 14:30.860
Why would you
call the other guy,

14:30.925 --> 14:33.195
the guy you hired,
and I heard you once,

14:33.260 --> 14:36.399
why would you call him "Mr.
Masters" on the telephone,

14:36.464 --> 14:38.233
when you thought
no one else was around?

14:38.298 --> 14:42.707
Magnum, a man with your intelligence
background should know,

14:42.770 --> 14:47.513
the secret to any
successful covert operation,

14:48.476 --> 14:52.250
is to maintain the facade even
when you are absolutely certain

14:52.313 --> 14:54.718
that the enemy
is nowhere around.

14:58.253 --> 14:59.388
Good night.

15:02.424 --> 15:06.165
Maggie, I'm sorry. I didn't
know you were coming.

15:06.228 --> 15:08.031
I wouldn't have kept you.

15:12.369 --> 15:14.406
You don't have good news,
do you?

15:20.710 --> 15:22.447
I think I knew all along.

15:24.547 --> 15:29.424
It's funny, you want
something, you really want it

15:31.055 --> 15:33.260
and you start to see things
a certain way.

15:33.824 --> 15:36.729
You start fooling yourself.

15:39.798 --> 15:40.900
So...

15:43.635 --> 15:44.870
Thank you.

15:46.972 --> 15:48.709
At least, now I know.

15:48.774 --> 15:53.350
Thomas, I'd give anything to
tell you your daughter's alive.

15:57.917 --> 15:59.152
Are you okay?

15:59.752 --> 16:01.087
I'm fine.

16:31.370 --> 16:33.741
Hope I didn't catch you
at a bad time?

16:41.246 --> 16:43.484
Pretty fancy digs.

16:44.783 --> 16:49.225
If I'd known you lived so high on the
hog, I would've found my way here sooner.

16:50.890 --> 16:53.929
I've been meaning to get to
this tree for a long time.

16:55.728 --> 16:57.932
Isn't there an easier way
to do that?

17:01.034 --> 17:04.875
You don't have to say it,
I can see it in your eyes.

17:04.938 --> 17:05.940
You're wondering,

17:06.006 --> 17:09.045
"What the heck is the Captain
doing in these parts anyhow?"

17:11.078 --> 17:14.919
Well, sir, suppose I told you
that I'm here because, well...

17:14.982 --> 17:16.484
Because

17:16.550 --> 17:18.621
you sort of wanted to
talk about some things,

17:18.685 --> 17:22.593
and instead I kind of slipped out the
back door when you weren't looking.

17:26.394 --> 17:30.836
You know, I was thinking that taking
a little detour through Hawaii,

17:30.899 --> 17:33.671
On My Way
from Miami to Anchorage,

17:33.735 --> 17:40.115
might demonstrate a certain amount
of, oh, contrition on my part?

17:40.176 --> 17:43.716
Enough maybe to warrant a couple
of days of your time at least?

17:45.748 --> 17:48.018
But I can go on my way
if you'd prefer.

17:56.259 --> 17:57.962
You can do whatever you want.

19:06.400 --> 19:08.170
I didn't do nothing!

19:29.991 --> 19:34.300
Name is Whitney Fisher.
A real fruitcake.

19:34.363 --> 19:38.137
He had pictures of Miss Ellison
plastered all over his hotel room.

19:38.201 --> 19:40.038
Along with his own little
artwork.

19:40.103 --> 19:42.040
Typical of that kind
of drifter, loser.

19:42.105 --> 19:43.307
So what happens next?

19:43.372 --> 19:45.109
There's not much to go on.

19:45.742 --> 19:47.979
He'll be arraigned.
Maybe go to trial.

19:48.044 --> 19:51.117
Probably be sent to a nice little
rest home run by the state.

19:51.181 --> 19:52.416
But no matter, the point is,

19:52.483 --> 19:54.243
he's off the street,
and your friend is safe.

19:54.651 --> 19:57.390
Which she'll probably
wanna hear from your lips.

19:58.522 --> 19:59.858
Hello, Thomas.

20:02.192 --> 20:03.327
Hi, Diana.

20:04.895 --> 20:06.732
How are you doing?

20:06.798 --> 20:07.900
Fine.

20:08.766 --> 20:09.934
Then maybe not.

20:11.436 --> 20:13.640
Listen, I've got
a couple of tickets

20:13.705 --> 20:16.310
to the Rainbow game
this afternoon.

20:16.374 --> 20:18.311
You paying attention?

20:18.376 --> 20:19.946
To the Rainbow game
this afternoon.

20:20.011 --> 20:21.246
I'm gonna be bogged down
with this,

20:21.313 --> 20:22.915
so you're welcome to them.

20:22.981 --> 20:24.984
Well, I have an appointment.

20:25.050 --> 20:27.889
And, there's also someone
I should talk to.

20:29.655 --> 20:31.458
Thanks, anyway. Uh-huh.

20:35.427 --> 20:39.067
Well, sir, the day he
left, he took me aside,

20:39.533 --> 20:41.203
very serious, he said,

20:42.035 --> 20:45.174
"Dad, if anything
should happen to me,."

20:45.639 --> 20:48.311
"I've left my will
inside the Bible."

20:50.911 --> 20:51.912
No kidding?

20:51.978 --> 20:55.184
No, that was your father.

20:57.485 --> 21:01.092
Now this is
an eight-year-old boy,

21:01.622 --> 21:02.992
a child,

21:03.057 --> 21:07.465
and he's written a will so that his
mother and! I won't bungle up his estate.

21:10.632 --> 21:13.838
Yeah, he was always
very concerned

21:13.901 --> 21:17.508
that things went the way
they were supposed to go.

21:19.241 --> 21:23.883
Sometimes it seemed like he was
the parent and I was the son.

21:23.946 --> 21:27.085
And that's just the way he was.

21:28.451 --> 21:32.091
Oh! I almost forgot!
I brought you something.

21:36.626 --> 21:37.762
Havanas.

21:38.662 --> 21:41.567
Yes, I still have connections
where they count.

21:41.998 --> 21:45.805
Thanks. This was given
to me by my father.

21:49.973 --> 21:52.211
How did you know I liked cigars?

21:52.276 --> 21:55.248
If your name
is Thomas Sullivan Magnum,

21:55.312 --> 21:56.748
you love cigars.

22:06.224 --> 22:08.461
"A woman is only a woman,

22:09.227 --> 22:13.603
"but a good cigar is a smoke."
Rudyard Kipling.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.803
The Betrothed.

22:16.869 --> 22:20.175
"You must choose
between me and your cigar."

22:20.239 --> 22:21.708
Exactly.

22:29.382 --> 22:31.419
So, why did you leave
the Navy, Captain?

22:31.484 --> 22:32.920
Why did you?

22:33.887 --> 22:36.692
All right, all right.

22:38.525 --> 22:42.232
Let me put it another way.

22:47.267 --> 22:49.639
You think, uh,
Dad would've ever left?

22:51.806 --> 22:53.543
I don't think so.

22:54.676 --> 22:59.552
I think the first word out of your
father's mouth was commitment.

22:59.614 --> 23:02.787
Tom was quite a little adult.

23:03.752 --> 23:08.060
I think somehow he knew that he
wasn't going to have much time,

23:08.122 --> 23:10.393
and he wanted to be sure

23:10.459 --> 23:13.832
that he made the most out of what
time he did have left on this earth.

23:14.697 --> 23:16.835
Why didn't you come
to his funeral?

23:22.839 --> 23:25.344
Nobody should lose a child.

23:26.876 --> 23:29.414
It's something
you never get over.

23:31.648 --> 23:33.919
I didn't know that
for a lot of years.

23:35.019 --> 23:37.256
I guess, I thought I...

23:38.689 --> 23:43.832
if I kept moving on I could
leave some of that pain behind.

23:46.731 --> 23:48.067
Ah, hell!

23:49.300 --> 23:50.402
Who am I kidding?

23:50.468 --> 23:52.405
I have always
had the wanderlust.

23:53.337 --> 23:56.677
Never was comfortable
sitting still.

23:57.809 --> 24:00.548
I wanted to be
the kind of guy who could,

24:01.380 --> 24:04.619
you know, stick around
for the long haul, but,

24:05.885 --> 24:07.354
I don't know, somehow...

24:07.419 --> 24:09.657
You just get the itch.

24:09.722 --> 24:11.191
Yeah.

24:12.759 --> 24:14.963
Thomas Sullivan Magnum I.

24:16.596 --> 24:18.333
What was your father like?

24:19.432 --> 24:21.269
Very much like your father.

24:24.303 --> 24:28.879
I guess the wanderlust
just skips a generation.

24:28.942 --> 24:33.116
Yeah. I can't say
that I regret it.

24:33.179 --> 24:35.183
I don't really regret anything.

24:36.583 --> 24:42.528
I said goodbye to your father
in my own way.

24:43.958 --> 24:45.628
But I do sometimes wonder.

24:45.693 --> 24:46.728
About what?

24:46.795 --> 24:48.932
Oh, I don't know. About

24:50.965 --> 24:53.303
what it would be like
to stick around long enough

24:53.368 --> 24:55.171
to really get to know somebody,

24:55.236 --> 24:59.510
instead of taking off
when they get too close.

25:01.010 --> 25:03.314
Well, maybe it's not too late,
Grandpa.

25:09.752 --> 25:12.357
You found some foolproof method

25:12.421 --> 25:14.224
for teaching old dogs
new tricks?

25:14.290 --> 25:15.793
Not exactly foolproof.

25:15.859 --> 25:17.027
Hello.

25:18.028 --> 25:19.029
Hi.

25:21.631 --> 25:23.568
I'm a little busy right now.

25:28.805 --> 25:31.710
I really don't think there's
anything left to say.

25:33.878 --> 25:36.516
Yeah. Of course
I know where it is.

25:37.582 --> 25:40.053
OO tomorrow morníng.

26:12.819 --> 26:13.987
Thomas.

26:22.629 --> 26:24.900
I want you to know that the other
day when you showed me the tape,

26:24.965 --> 26:26.802
I really believed you.

26:26.867 --> 26:29.171
It's okay, they're with me.

26:31.105 --> 26:32.741
Maggie, what's going on?

26:32.806 --> 26:35.444
I know how you feel about Buck.

26:35.509 --> 26:37.145
And I don't always agree
with him either.

26:37.212 --> 26:38.815
In fact, sometimes
I don't really understand

26:38.880 --> 26:41.351
why he's done some of the
things that he's done.

26:41.415 --> 26:42.651
The French government,

26:42.717 --> 26:45.221
as far as they're concerned
and everyone else,

26:45.286 --> 26:47.089
your daughter Lily is dead.

26:49.391 --> 26:50.493
Thomas, coming to you
the other day,

26:50.559 --> 26:52.396
was the hardest thing
I've ever had to do.

26:52.460 --> 26:53.662
I've never lied to you before,

26:53.728 --> 26:56.734
but if you had kept
on investigating,

26:56.799 --> 26:58.334
you would've
endangered Lily's life.

27:13.817 --> 27:14.919
Papa!

27:56.179 --> 27:57.281
Captain!

27:59.917 --> 28:00.918
Captain!

28:02.219 --> 28:04.289
Okay, you wait right here.

28:05.690 --> 28:09.664
I am going to introduce you
to your great-grandfather.

28:09.727 --> 28:12.766
Your grandfather,
old grandfather, wait.

28:14.767 --> 28:16.704
Grandpa?

28:33.419 --> 28:34.487
Papa.

28:34.554 --> 28:35.722
I'm coming, Lily.

28:37.991 --> 28:39.159
J Well

28:40.360 --> 28:46.205
it looks like you're not gonna get a chance
to meet your great-grandfather this time.

28:46.266 --> 28:49.806
See, he kind of felt
that he had to leave.

28:49.870 --> 28:52.642
But don't be mad at him,
he's really a great guy.

28:52.706 --> 28:54.409
That's just the Captain.

28:55.943 --> 28:58.114
He came back! He came back.

28:59.547 --> 29:01.350
I'm coming, Captain!

29:02.650 --> 29:04.721
Carol. Come on in. Hi.

29:04.786 --> 29:06.121
You left a message
on my machine.

29:06.187 --> 29:08.324
I know.
Yes, you said it was urgent.

29:08.389 --> 29:10.359
I know. Come on, come here.

29:13.361 --> 29:14.930
Come on.

29:14.996 --> 29:17.401
Carol, I want you to meet
my daughter, Lily Catherine.

29:17.466 --> 29:18.568
Hello.

29:19.334 --> 29:20.636
Your what? Yes.

29:20.702 --> 29:22.238
You have a... Yes.

29:22.304 --> 29:24.041
And you never told me?

29:24.106 --> 29:25.776
Oh, now, don't start in.

29:25.842 --> 29:27.478
But no, we're supposed
to be friends,

29:27.543 --> 29:29.680
and you never happened to mention
that you have a daughter.

29:29.745 --> 29:31.782
I was gonna tell you, I just
couldn't figure out what to say.

29:31.848 --> 29:34.386
Well, how about, "Carol, did I ever
tell you that I have a daughter?"

29:34.450 --> 29:36.287
Búp bê, Papa.

29:38.321 --> 29:40.191
Oh! Okay, honey.

29:42.092 --> 29:43.093
Búp bê.

29:43.160 --> 29:44.563
She wants her dolly.

29:46.864 --> 29:49.102
You have a daughter.

29:49.167 --> 29:50.502
Thomas, you have a daughter.

29:50.567 --> 29:52.070
Carol, I already told you that.

29:52.136 --> 29:53.538
Now listen, I need a favor.

29:53.604 --> 29:56.042
Here you go, darling.
This'll have to do.

29:56.975 --> 29:58.477
This is Auntie Carol.

29:58.543 --> 29:59.645
Thomas.

30:00.210 --> 30:01.980
Carol. Carol?

30:02.046 --> 30:03.249
Exactly.

30:03.781 --> 30:05.684
Oh, Thomas.

30:05.750 --> 30:08.489
Auntie Carol is going to
look after you for a while.

30:08.553 --> 30:09.554
While Daddy...

30:09.621 --> 30:11.391
Daddy.

30:11.456 --> 30:12.926
Runs some errands.

30:12.992 --> 30:15.831
I have a surprise for Rick. Actually,
it's a surprise for all of you.

30:15.895 --> 30:17.965
So will you stay, Auntie Carol?

30:18.030 --> 30:20.368
Well, of course, I mean...

30:20.432 --> 30:22.969
But I want to talk to you about this.
I know.

30:23.036 --> 30:24.037
Now I mean it, Thomas.

30:24.104 --> 30:25.306
Yes, but I can't right now,
honest.

30:25.371 --> 30:27.708
And I really appreciate this.
I'll be back.

30:27.774 --> 30:29.510
Oh, she doesn't speak
any English.

30:29.575 --> 30:31.111
Just French and Vietnamese.

30:31.177 --> 30:32.212
What?

30:33.547 --> 30:34.782
Thomas!

30:38.752 --> 30:39.753
Bonjour.

30:40.087 --> 30:41.355
Higgins!

30:42.123 --> 30:44.227
Oh, geez, Thomas. I forgot
all about telling him.

30:44.291 --> 30:45.694
Higgins.
Thomas, I got to talk to you.

30:45.760 --> 30:47.440
No, I'm kind of in a hurry
right now, Rick.

30:47.460 --> 30:48.663
I have... Why the dark glasses?

30:48.729 --> 30:50.364
No reason. Kenji will show you.

30:50.431 --> 30:51.833
We have an additional
member of the wedding party.

30:51.899 --> 30:53.235
Thomas. At this late hour?

30:53.301 --> 30:55.505
Carol will tell you all about it.
I gotta run.

30:55.570 --> 30:57.073
Thomas!

30:58.339 --> 30:59.541
What?

31:02.978 --> 31:06.284
I'm just gonna say it. I asked T.C.
to be my best man.

31:06.347 --> 31:07.516
Oh, okay.

31:07.583 --> 31:09.085
Well, I know how much
it means to you,

31:09.151 --> 31:10.954
and I'm really sorry
to spring it on you like this.

31:11.019 --> 31:12.422
It's okay. I just...

31:12.487 --> 31:14.357
Hey! What, what
about the fitting?

31:14.423 --> 31:16.895
I don't need it! Thomas!

31:16.960 --> 31:18.763
Dad, Dad.

31:18.828 --> 31:20.363
I don't want anything to go wrong.
Dad.

31:20.429 --> 31:21.464
Hey, baby.

31:22.397 --> 31:24.902
Welcome to Hawaii.

31:24.968 --> 31:26.170
Hi, Bryant.

31:26.235 --> 31:27.805
You're getting so big.

31:30.140 --> 31:31.408
Uh, Dad?

31:32.176 --> 31:34.881
Did mom say anything to you
about coming to Hawaii?

31:37.181 --> 31:38.316
Tina?

31:39.883 --> 31:41.185
Surprise!

31:42.886 --> 31:44.723
I got to the airport and...

31:45.489 --> 31:47.826
Well, here I am.

31:49.227 --> 31:50.696
Well, this has nothing
to do with the fact

31:50.761 --> 31:54.268
that the last time I let Melody
come alone she was kidnapped.

31:54.331 --> 31:56.134
I wasn't planning
on staying long.

31:57.035 --> 32:00.742
Actually, I didn't
have any plans at all.

32:00.805 --> 32:02.141
I just thought I would come over

32:02.208 --> 32:06.482
and stay awhile, and see.

32:10.883 --> 32:13.387
Oh, just a minute.

32:13.452 --> 32:16.724
Miss, here. Keep the change.

32:43.617 --> 32:45.888
Lieutenant,
I think we've got a problem.

32:45.953 --> 32:47.956
Great, get those inquiries
back yet?

32:48.022 --> 32:49.325
That's it.

32:49.390 --> 32:52.094
Whitney Fisher was locked up
in the state hospital

32:52.161 --> 32:55.200
at the time of both attacks
on Linda Lee Ellison.

32:55.264 --> 32:57.134
Whoever was after her
is still out there.

32:57.199 --> 32:58.601
So there's no chance
of a mistake?

32:58.666 --> 33:01.304
No, sir, I think
we should call Thomas.

33:02.104 --> 33:04.041
- And telephone number.
- Thank you.

33:04.106 --> 33:05.709
Magnum! Hey, Magnum!

33:05.774 --> 33:07.611
Hello, hello?

33:08.577 --> 33:10.380
Now what? I'm calling the girl.

33:12.648 --> 33:14.752
Hello, I'm not here ríght now.

33:14.818 --> 33:17.355
Please leave your name and
number and I'll get back to you.

33:18.487 --> 33:22.094
Thís ís Líeutenant Page, ít's very ímportant
that you get back to me ríght away.

33:22.158 --> 33:23.361
Thank you.

33:28.365 --> 33:30.168
I'm glad I caught up with you.

33:30.234 --> 33:31.469
Me, too.

33:31.902 --> 33:35.843
I just... l couldn't
leave it the way it was.

33:37.508 --> 33:38.643
Thanks.

33:39.944 --> 33:43.518
I think it's really wonderful you're
gonna spend time with your daughter.

33:43.581 --> 33:44.749
Thanks.

33:44.815 --> 33:47.620
And I think it's great,
what you've decided to do.

34:48.750 --> 34:49.985
What's that?

34:50.485 --> 34:52.790
Music for the guests
as they arrive.

34:52.853 --> 34:54.123
The guests are arriving now?

34:54.190 --> 34:56.193
No, the musicians
are rehearsing.

34:56.257 --> 34:57.360
Where is Thomas?

34:57.426 --> 34:58.629
He'll be here!

34:58.694 --> 35:00.396
He's not coming.

35:00.462 --> 35:01.932
He's covering up
on the whole thing.

35:01.997 --> 35:04.569
He was really upset
about that best man thing.

35:04.633 --> 35:06.570
That's why he said he
didn't need a morning coat.

35:06.635 --> 35:08.071
Well, he doesn't have
one of mine.

35:08.138 --> 35:09.139
I knew it!

35:09.206 --> 35:11.243
He'll be here. Relax, will you?

35:12.242 --> 35:13.878
L... l, Rick Wright...

35:15.145 --> 35:16.480
I, Rick Wright...

35:17.747 --> 35:19.216
I, Rick Wright...

35:19.916 --> 35:22.621
Guys, do you think maybe
I'm rushing into this thing?

35:40.790 --> 35:41.992
Thomas.

36:08.686 --> 36:09.821
Thomas.

36:52.632 --> 36:53.968
Thomas.

37:48.291 --> 37:49.661
Thomas.

37:54.665 --> 37:56.402
You had to get in the way.

37:59.703 --> 38:03.544
I wouldn't hurt her,
I just wanted to scare her.

38:04.809 --> 38:07.513
And it worked, she needed me.

38:09.681 --> 38:13.188
I was more than just
a security guard to her.

38:16.354 --> 38:17.889
Then she betrayed me.

38:22.762 --> 38:24.665
But I could see,

38:27.733 --> 38:29.269
it was your fault.

39:27.463 --> 39:29.701
Hi, I'm Jim Bonig.

39:29.766 --> 39:32.003
Don't even start with him.

39:54.759 --> 39:56.027
I can't believe Thomas
didn't show up,

39:56.093 --> 39:57.695
just because he's not
the best man.

39:57.762 --> 40:01.169
That's so petty.
Higgins, your sunglasses.

40:01.967 --> 40:03.169
Oh.

40:45.779 --> 40:47.682
Where the hell have you been?

40:48.549 --> 40:49.651
Surprise!

42:23.283 --> 42:28.092
Dearly beloved, we are gathered
together here in the sight of God,

42:28.155 --> 42:29.925
and all assembled

42:29.990 --> 42:34.766
to join this man and this
woman in holy matrimony.

42:35.663 --> 42:38.067
Alice Cleopatra Mitchell,

42:38.132 --> 42:40.035
do you take this man to be your

42:40.100 --> 42:42.037
lawfully wedded husband...
What'd you do, re-up?

42:42.102 --> 42:44.540
To love and to honor...
Exactly.

42:44.605 --> 42:47.010
For better or for worse,

42:47.075 --> 42:49.345
for as long as you both
shall live?

42:49.410 --> 42:50.478
I do.

42:51.813 --> 42:55.787
And do you,
Orville Wilbur Wright Ill,

42:55.850 --> 42:57.653
take this woman to be

42:57.719 --> 42:59.355
your lawfully wedded wife...
Magnum.

42:59.421 --> 43:00.990
For better or for worse...

43:01.057 --> 43:02.592
You know what I told you
about Robin Masters?

43:02.657 --> 43:04.527
For richer or for poorer...
Yeah?

43:04.593 --> 43:06.296
In sickness and in health...

43:06.361 --> 43:09.166
I lied... To honor and obey,

43:09.231 --> 43:12.036
to respect and to cherish,

43:12.101 --> 43:14.639
in happiness and in sorrow,

43:14.704 --> 43:16.841
for as long as you both
shall live?

43:39.931 --> 43:41.099
I do.

43:48.640 --> 43:49.842
I do.

43:53.912 --> 43:55.214
I do.

43:56.682 --> 43:57.850
I...

44:57.546 --> 44:58.547
Goodnight.
