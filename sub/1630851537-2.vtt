WEBVTT

00:10.093 --> 00:12.220
-Good morning, everyone.
-Good morning.

00:12.303 --> 00:14.389
-How'd you sleep?
-Good.

00:14.472 --> 00:18.184
I opened my window and I fell asleep
to the sound of ocean waves

00:18.268 --> 00:20.353
and the smell of weed dispensaries.

00:21.604 --> 00:23.148
Hey, where do you keep your beans?

00:23.231 --> 00:25.942
I would love an Ethiopian Yirgacheffe
dark roast.

00:26.651 --> 00:28.945
I have no idea what you just said.

00:29.029 --> 00:31.072
We don't keep coffee in the house.

00:31.156 --> 00:35.702
Sadhguru says caffeinated drinks
are water's drug addicted cousins.

00:36.453 --> 00:37.454
Okay.

00:38.038 --> 00:41.666
You know what? I'm in L.A. now,
I might as well embrace it.

00:41.750 --> 00:43.668
Caffeine-addict Chelsea was the old me,

00:43.752 --> 00:47.297
the me that was Dwayne's assistant,
and Dwayne's girlfriend,

00:47.380 --> 00:50.675
and Dwayne's kidney donor
before we found out it was just gas.

00:51.468 --> 00:52.886
I'm moving on to the new me.

00:52.969 --> 00:54.929
What's on deck for the new me?

00:55.013 --> 00:56.014
I mean you.

00:56.097 --> 00:57.891
I mean, Chelsea, what are you doing today?

00:58.892 --> 01:00.977
I have decided to get a job.

01:01.061 --> 01:03.605
-That's great.
-Just don't become a lawyer.

01:03.688 --> 01:05.106
It'll destroy your soul.

01:05.190 --> 01:07.150
Also parking at the courthouse
is a nightmare.

01:08.151 --> 01:09.152
Noted.

01:10.278 --> 01:13.323
How are you with a camera?
I'm looking for a good videographer.

01:14.074 --> 01:14.908
Um...

01:14.991 --> 01:18.203
Just cut a reel together
and e-mail it to my assistant.

01:18.286 --> 01:19.913
That position is open as well.

01:21.331 --> 01:24.793
The important thing is I am putting
Harvard and Dwayne behind me.

01:24.876 --> 01:26.544
So I can focus on writing my novel.

01:26.628 --> 01:31.216
For one must close a chapter
to thusly begin thy next anew.

01:32.133 --> 01:35.011
You talk like a troll guarding a bridge.

01:38.681 --> 01:41.101
Chelsea, it's a package for you from...

01:41.768 --> 01:42.602
Dwayne.

01:43.520 --> 01:44.354
Dwayne?

01:44.854 --> 01:47.690
Maybe this time, it is "The Rock" Johnson.

01:49.692 --> 01:53.822
Oh, Dwayne sent your stuff.
I'm sorry, Chels. That's gotta be so hard.

01:53.905 --> 01:56.699
What--? No, no. It's fine.

01:56.783 --> 01:59.702
You know, it's a good thing.
We're both moving on.

01:59.786 --> 02:00.620
Thusly.

02:03.081 --> 02:04.874
But Dwayne only dumped you yesterday.

02:04.958 --> 02:08.586
Yes, we're all very aware
of how recently my life fell apart.

02:08.670 --> 02:10.380
That means he overnighted the box.

02:10.463 --> 02:13.883
Okay, so he overnighted the box.
What's the big deal?

02:13.967 --> 02:16.302
Or he didn't overnight the box.

02:16.386 --> 02:19.347
-Perhaps it was sent a while ago.
-She's lawyering.

02:20.014 --> 02:22.559
Ergo, the sending of the box
was a pre-meditated event

02:22.642 --> 02:23.768
which would mean...

02:26.896 --> 02:30.066
-What would it mean, Solana?
-Hang on. Hang on.

02:30.900 --> 02:32.152
Are you trying to say

02:32.235 --> 02:35.071
Dwayne knew he was going
to break up with me before yesterday

02:35.155 --> 02:37.866
and then he put me on a plane,
sent me across the country

02:37.949 --> 02:40.160
having no intention of ever
joining me out here?

02:40.869 --> 02:42.704
No. No way.

02:42.787 --> 02:43.913
-Of course not.
-No.

02:43.997 --> 02:44.914
Definitely not.

02:44.998 --> 02:48.042
Actually, it says he sent this box
six days ago.

02:48.126 --> 02:50.503
So, yes, that's exactly what happened.

02:52.589 --> 02:54.507
-What?
-Oh, no, wait.

02:54.591 --> 02:56.176
That was the wrong answer.

02:56.259 --> 02:58.386
He sent it a month ago.

02:59.304 --> 03:00.138
Still wrong?

03:00.221 --> 03:02.515
I'm sorry,
I don't know how to help this woman.

03:22.285 --> 03:27.749
She's been laying on the couch all day.
She just keeps staring at that box.

03:27.832 --> 03:29.125
Has she even peed?

03:30.919 --> 03:34.672
Chels, sweetie? Have you even peed?

03:34.756 --> 03:36.257
Oh, what's the point?

03:37.175 --> 03:41.512
To spend your eternity peeing
only having to pee again.

03:42.180 --> 03:45.683
'Tis Sisyphean to piss and...

03:46.142 --> 03:47.477
pee again.

03:48.061 --> 03:50.772
I actually get that.
Peeing is super annoying.

03:56.402 --> 03:59.739
-Grant, what happened?
-You look like a sexy pirate.

03:59.822 --> 04:03.117
I mean, pirate. They're all sexy.

04:03.785 --> 04:05.411
Oh, yeah. It's no big deal.

04:05.495 --> 04:07.705
I had a huge leg day with a client.

04:07.789 --> 04:09.249
My right quad's a little tight.

04:09.332 --> 04:10.833
Gonna grab my foam roller.

04:10.917 --> 04:14.963
Oh, Grant, I'm sorry, but I think
Chelsea really needs it right now.

04:15.046 --> 04:17.924
Oh, of course.
Foamy is an amazing snuggler.

04:18.841 --> 04:20.635
I feel so terrible for her.

04:20.718 --> 04:23.137
When we were teenagers,
Chelsea moved in with our dad,

04:23.221 --> 04:26.307
so we never got a chance to be there
for each other through breakups.

04:26.391 --> 04:28.601
But now I can finally help her.

04:28.685 --> 04:29.978
Into the shower?

04:30.687 --> 04:33.648
By working my sisterly magic.

04:33.731 --> 04:35.900
So if you will just give Chelsea
a bit of space,

04:35.984 --> 04:38.278
-I'll get her through this in no time.
-Good thing.

04:38.361 --> 04:41.614
Because the living room
is starting to smell a little like a...

04:41.698 --> 04:43.116
Fart in a Ford Focus.

04:44.033 --> 04:46.869
You are so good at smells.

04:46.953 --> 04:47.954
It's a gift.

04:52.417 --> 04:54.836
Hey, do you mind if I meditate out here?

04:54.919 --> 04:57.964
I'm trying to honor Claire's intention
to make space for Chelsea.

04:58.548 --> 05:00.466
Our roommate of one day.

05:01.467 --> 05:03.636
Go for it. We're giving Chelsea space too.

05:03.720 --> 05:07.390
Instead of foam rolling,
I'm smashing my quad with my fist.

05:07.473 --> 05:10.310
And I'm letting my horned out friend
watch Grant.

05:11.060 --> 05:13.021
That's enough for today, Grandma.

05:13.604 --> 05:14.480
Good night.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.942
I can't meditate here
with these mosquitoes.

05:18.026 --> 05:21.154
Bugs love vegans.
They can sense we're less threatening.

05:21.863 --> 05:23.239
Gotcha, bitch!

05:25.074 --> 05:28.911
So how long do we think
Claire's sisterly magic is going to take?

05:29.495 --> 05:32.707
Magic during a waning moon could be ages.

05:32.790 --> 05:36.377
But I've got my weekly livestream tomorrow
for my rest and reloungation hour.

05:36.461 --> 05:38.212
Sponsored by an adult onesie brand.

05:38.296 --> 05:39.756
I've gotta do it from the sofa.

05:39.839 --> 05:42.008
It's the most reloungational spot
in the house.

05:42.091 --> 05:44.177
And I have an energy client coming.

05:44.260 --> 05:46.804
A woman crying on a couch
might give people the idea

05:46.888 --> 05:49.891
that astrological-based energy healing
isn't legitimate.

05:50.975 --> 05:54.187
I'm sure it won't be much longer.
Claire's a super-good sister.

05:54.270 --> 05:58.566
She's sweet. She's funny. She's beautiful.
She's caring and gentle.

05:58.649 --> 05:59.984
She smells like honey.

06:00.068 --> 06:02.362
-Grant, what?
-What?

06:03.738 --> 06:07.700
What I mean is Claire's probably
got Chelsea feeling better already.

06:07.784 --> 06:09.994
I hope I die soon.

06:11.204 --> 06:14.624
And that my body decomposes
faster than this cardboard

06:14.707 --> 06:17.460
that houses the shrapnel of my heart.

06:18.044 --> 06:21.130
Wow, you sure know a lot of ways
to say you're sad.

06:21.214 --> 06:24.967
Here, I heated up
a nice hot mug of Diet Coke for you.

06:25.051 --> 06:26.511
Mm.

06:30.014 --> 06:31.974
Why don't I get rid of this box for you

06:32.058 --> 06:34.143
so you don't even
have to stare at it anymore?

06:34.227 --> 06:37.772
I'll just get it all unpacked
and put away,

06:37.855 --> 06:41.317
and you can focus on thusly beginning anew

06:41.401 --> 06:43.361
your fresh start anew.

06:44.278 --> 06:47.031
I suppose the quickest way
across the valley of grief

06:47.115 --> 06:48.408
is directly through it.

06:49.450 --> 06:51.202
-So...?
-Yes. That's a yes.

06:53.579 --> 06:54.414
Okay...

06:54.872 --> 06:55.915
Um...

06:59.752 --> 07:01.712
There's a picture of you and Dwayne.

07:05.049 --> 07:06.092
And...

07:06.926 --> 07:08.845
an old Harvard sweatshirt.

07:10.012 --> 07:11.347
And...

07:11.431 --> 07:13.015
What is this?

07:13.599 --> 07:15.476
Is this a piece of chalk?

07:16.185 --> 07:19.272
I saved it from the first lecture of his
I went to.

07:19.355 --> 07:22.358
Ironically,
it was on the Romanticism period.

07:26.237 --> 07:27.238
Oh.

07:28.197 --> 07:29.699
-There's a note.

07:32.660 --> 07:33.703
It's from Dwayne.

07:36.247 --> 07:38.541
-Here, read it. I can't.
-Oh. Are you sure?

07:38.624 --> 07:41.711
-I think I can handle it.
-You just said you can't.

07:41.794 --> 07:42.879
Just read it.

07:42.962 --> 07:44.547
Okay. Okay.

07:45.173 --> 07:46.048
Um...

07:47.341 --> 07:49.552
"Chelsea, I hope you're satisfactory.

07:49.635 --> 07:52.305
Enclosed, please find
your goods and chattels

07:52.388 --> 07:55.183
dutifully packed and boxed
by my new assistant."

07:55.766 --> 07:57.518
What? New assistant?

07:57.602 --> 08:00.021
-Dwayne has a new assistant already?
-Is that bad?

08:00.104 --> 08:03.441
-How could he?
-Clearly it's bad. But I don't know why.

08:04.108 --> 08:08.362
He's replacing me with someone, Claire.
And not just as an assistant.

08:08.446 --> 08:11.491
Dwayne is the Don Juan
of the Humanities Department,

08:11.574 --> 08:15.328
and his signature method of citation
formatting alone is a panty dropper.

08:16.496 --> 08:19.040
I bet they're already
making passionate love

08:19.123 --> 08:20.666
on his splintered office floor.

08:21.334 --> 08:23.503
I guess that explains your tweezers.

08:27.423 --> 08:29.884
I'm glad you opened this box.

08:29.967 --> 08:32.553
Because now I know what I need to do.

08:33.137 --> 08:35.848
Spend every waking moment

08:35.932 --> 08:39.060
figuring out who this trollop is.

08:45.233 --> 08:48.653
Alesandra,
you were always all over Dwayne.

08:48.736 --> 08:51.822
And now here you are
sliding into the comment section

08:51.906 --> 08:53.658
of his doctoral thesis.

08:53.741 --> 08:56.744
Chelsea, do you mind? I'm with a client.

08:56.827 --> 08:59.622
Oh, right. Sorry. Sorry.
I'm not even here.

09:00.122 --> 09:05.127
Okay. Just relax and re-center.

09:05.211 --> 09:06.587
Then there's Yazmina.

09:06.671 --> 09:08.548
With her big ass jugs

09:08.631 --> 09:11.884
that she acquired as part
of her indigenous pottery collection.

09:11.968 --> 09:13.970
Plus she's got huge knockers.

09:16.013 --> 09:17.056
No.

09:17.139 --> 09:19.767
No, no, no, no, no.

09:19.850 --> 09:21.018
And no.

09:22.728 --> 09:23.563
Psst. Psst.

09:24.146 --> 09:25.398
Hi.

09:25.481 --> 09:28.734
-Please continue with your breathing.
-It's kind of hard

09:28.818 --> 09:30.486
-with Cold Case over there.
-Try!

09:32.822 --> 09:34.949
-This is out of control.
-Yeah.

09:35.032 --> 09:37.618
Claire's sisterly magic has made it worse.

09:37.702 --> 09:39.870
Why can't Chelsea have her breakdown

09:39.954 --> 09:42.873
in a Dunkin' Donuts bathroom
like the rest of us?

09:43.499 --> 09:46.168
Chelsea's really starting
to pull through, don't you think?

09:46.252 --> 09:48.337
I see you, Tabitha.

09:48.921 --> 09:50.840
Yeah. No. She's not.

09:51.465 --> 09:54.427
Look, Claire, I love you.
You're my best friend.

09:54.510 --> 09:56.637
-I worship the ground you walk on.
-Same--

09:56.721 --> 09:59.682
But that ground is covered
in your sister's crap.

09:59.765 --> 10:03.519
Yeah, and my client's so angry,
his third eye is glaring at me.

10:04.186 --> 10:07.315
Sounds like he could use a healer.
Know anybody?

10:07.398 --> 10:08.482
It's you.

10:09.650 --> 10:12.612
I need to do my onesie livestream
from the sofa.

10:12.695 --> 10:15.656
This is my job.
This is how I make my living.

10:15.740 --> 10:19.869
And Chelsea is acting like a big baby.

10:21.287 --> 10:25.583
Maybe you could do it from somewhere else,
like the shed!

10:25.666 --> 10:27.585
Ooh. The shed.

10:28.169 --> 10:31.714
Sleepwear in a shed?
What, am I the boy from Room?

10:33.716 --> 10:36.510
Okay, you're right.
I've been too delicate.

10:37.762 --> 10:40.598
It's time to turn my sisterly magic
up to a nine.

10:40.681 --> 10:41.766
But why not ten?

10:41.849 --> 10:44.143
I'm saving that for Disneyland.

10:45.061 --> 10:46.187
Oh, I can't.

10:49.649 --> 10:52.485
Ugh. This is going to ruin my career.

10:53.027 --> 10:55.529
It's literally the least reloungable place

10:55.613 --> 10:57.823
in the history of relounging.

10:59.158 --> 11:00.368
Ah! God.

11:00.910 --> 11:02.536
So much wood.

11:06.540 --> 11:09.627
Okay, Jayden Jay J. Michael Jiang,
it's just like Mother said, right?

11:10.336 --> 11:13.631
Get on that runway
and I'll change your diaper after.

11:19.970 --> 11:22.056
OMG, hi.

11:23.599 --> 11:29.105
Welcome to the rest and reloungation hour,
sponsored by Onesie Night Stand,

11:29.188 --> 11:33.192
the only adult onesie
perfect for a night in and a night out.

11:33.275 --> 11:35.695
As you know, I'm Jayden Jay J. Michael--

11:36.821 --> 11:41.701
Don't mind that. That's just
a luxurious little gardening item.

11:45.037 --> 11:47.456
As you can see, I'm here.

11:47.540 --> 11:52.920
I'm livestreaming
from just the coziest, um, drafty shed.

11:53.003 --> 11:54.088
Um...

11:55.798 --> 11:56.841
Uh...

12:00.761 --> 12:02.847
Anyway-- Good God!

12:07.435 --> 12:08.561
My backsie.

12:16.152 --> 12:16.986
Foamy.

12:31.625 --> 12:33.753
-What just happened?
-I'm so sorry.

12:33.836 --> 12:36.672
Oh, my God, was that your--? Oh, my God.

12:36.756 --> 12:37.673
I'm sorry.

12:37.757 --> 12:38.841
It's okay.

12:39.592 --> 12:40.426
Just okay?

12:42.261 --> 12:44.013
No. I mean, it's okay that--

12:44.889 --> 12:46.724
You know what? Let's not talk in circles

12:46.807 --> 12:48.267
-about me touching your--
-Penis.

12:48.350 --> 12:52.146
Grant. I need to get back
to my investigation.

12:52.229 --> 12:55.733
Oh, no need to investigate.
The other thing you touched was my nuts.

12:57.610 --> 12:58.944
Hey, Chels.

12:59.028 --> 13:02.823
How about I open the door
and get a little breeze going?

13:04.742 --> 13:07.620
Oh, my, there's flowers out here.

13:08.204 --> 13:09.747
But for whom?

13:12.541 --> 13:14.168
They're for you!

13:15.211 --> 13:16.962
Oh, and there's a note.

13:17.838 --> 13:19.006
It's from Dwayne.

13:21.383 --> 13:25.888
"I'm sorry for being a big creep
and sleeping with all my employees.

13:25.971 --> 13:30.851
I respect you, and I want you
to prove me wrong by kicking butt in L.A."

13:31.685 --> 13:34.146
-Okay, potty mouth.
-I don't have time for this.

13:34.230 --> 13:36.732
-Wait, there's another note.
-Jesus.

13:36.816 --> 13:40.027
It's from his new assistant, Tabitha.

13:40.653 --> 13:41.821
You solved it.

13:42.863 --> 13:46.158
Tabitha says, "I could never replace you
mentally or physically.

13:46.242 --> 13:48.577
Seriously, you're way hot."

13:49.370 --> 13:50.329
That was so sweet.

13:50.412 --> 13:53.749
Claire, I know what you're trying to do.
But just stop.

13:53.833 --> 13:56.585
Chels, I'm your sister.
Let me help you get through this.

13:56.669 --> 14:00.047
Just because you're my sister doesn't
mean you magically know what I need.

14:00.130 --> 14:04.552
So let me make it crystal clear!
I need you to leave me alone!

14:07.179 --> 14:08.013
Okay.

14:09.974 --> 14:10.975
Got it.

14:12.560 --> 14:15.312
I am so sorry about today's session.

14:23.195 --> 14:25.030
You know what? No.

14:26.073 --> 14:30.786
I'm not gonna leave you alone because
what you are doing here is not okay!

14:31.704 --> 14:33.414
-Here, Grant.
-I'm using that!

14:33.497 --> 14:34.456
Not anymore!

14:34.540 --> 14:35.791
Thank God.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.459
This is their house too!

14:37.543 --> 14:39.753
Chelsea, you can be mean to me,

14:39.837 --> 14:43.173
but I will not let you be disrespectful
to my friends.

14:43.257 --> 14:46.010
If you can't accept that,
I don't think you should live here.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.179
Plot twist.

14:49.722 --> 14:54.518
The shed-for-a-motel for rest
and reloungation hour was a hit!

14:55.728 --> 14:58.564
My followers love the post. Obsessed.

14:58.647 --> 15:02.651
And the onesie company is fixated
on a new butt flap for easy access.

15:03.193 --> 15:05.696
So I'm, like, an inventor.

15:08.282 --> 15:10.826
And I have you to thank for it.

15:11.452 --> 15:13.120
Miss Jagged Little Pill.

15:14.288 --> 15:16.123
Hey, do you want a free onesie?

15:16.707 --> 15:19.126
You get a onesie, and you get a onesie,

15:19.209 --> 15:21.712
and you get a onesie,
and you get a onesie.

15:21.795 --> 15:23.797
We're all getting onesies!

15:27.384 --> 15:29.428
I wanted to bring you free shots

15:29.511 --> 15:33.599
to apologize for the whole Chelsea thing,
but I spilled them on the way here.

15:33.682 --> 15:36.101
But maybe you can lick them off the tray.

15:36.894 --> 15:39.939
It's okay.
You were just trying to be a good sister.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.691
And you are a good sister.

15:43.317 --> 15:47.321
Any sister would be lucky to have you
as a sister for that sister.

15:51.116 --> 15:52.034
Thanks, Grant.

15:52.660 --> 15:53.619
Yeah, it's fine.

15:53.702 --> 15:56.872
My client didn't give me a bad review
in exchange for a free mantra.

15:58.540 --> 16:00.584
And my comments section
is still blowing up.

16:00.668 --> 16:02.753
People are saying I give good shit.

16:03.420 --> 16:04.588
Oh.

16:04.672 --> 16:05.965
I just got that.

16:07.049 --> 16:09.843
Thanks, guys.
I'll be back with more free shots.

16:10.636 --> 16:15.015
Claire, you gotta stop talking
about free shots in front of your manager.

16:15.099 --> 16:16.433
I'm right here.

16:16.517 --> 16:21.397
And please, Table 14
still hasn't gotten their... anything.

16:22.147 --> 16:23.941
On it. Thanks, Howard.

16:27.528 --> 16:29.863
Wow, look at you.

16:29.947 --> 16:33.200
Yeah, you look so much better
when you're not covered in filth.

16:35.494 --> 16:40.082
Thank you. I took a shower.
I'll clean the ring around the tub later.

16:42.126 --> 16:45.295
Um, look, I owe you all a huge apology.

16:45.379 --> 16:49.299
I was really disrespectful
of your shared space and generosity,

16:49.383 --> 16:50.759
and I'm really sorry.

16:51.343 --> 16:53.012
It's all good. Breakups are hard.

16:53.595 --> 16:56.682
I was so mixed up after my last breakup,
I RSVP'd yes

16:56.765 --> 16:59.476
to a charcuterie party
at Armie Hammer's house.

17:02.563 --> 17:05.149
Thanks, guys. Um, I'll be right back.

17:08.610 --> 17:10.487
-Hey.
-Hi.

17:14.199 --> 17:16.201
Claire, you said back at the house

17:16.285 --> 17:20.247
that I could be mean to you,
but no, I can't.

17:20.330 --> 17:23.083
I mean, I can. I'm very capable of it.

17:23.167 --> 17:27.046
Senior year, my Poli Sci teacher told me
I had an Ayn Randian honesty.

17:29.131 --> 17:31.133
But I shouldn't be mean to you.

17:31.216 --> 17:34.970
You didn't do anything wrong.
If anything, you did everything right.

17:35.054 --> 17:37.014
Yeah, except the hot Diet Coke.

17:37.598 --> 17:39.433
I forgot the mini marshmallows.

17:41.143 --> 17:43.562
We haven't lived together since I was 13.

17:43.645 --> 17:45.439
It'll take a while to figure this out.

17:46.899 --> 17:50.235
That is, if I can stay.

17:51.361 --> 17:52.196
Of course.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.492
Do you wanna hold hands?

17:57.326 --> 17:59.036
I think the hug's enough.

18:00.370 --> 18:03.582
Oh, I should tell you,
I did something bad.

18:03.665 --> 18:04.792
What did you do?

18:04.875 --> 18:07.628
Well, you were so upset and hurt by Dwayne

18:07.711 --> 18:10.422
that I sent a bag of dog poop
to his house.

18:13.383 --> 18:15.761
-Excuse me?
-They have companies that do that.

18:15.844 --> 18:18.013
A revenge podcast I listen to
advertises it.

18:18.097 --> 18:21.934
"Fifteen percent off the first bag
with offer code 'Get the Last Turd.'"

18:24.144 --> 18:28.732
Wow. That is the grossest thing
anyone has ever done for me.

18:30.442 --> 18:31.360
Thank you.

18:32.319 --> 18:34.071
So, what's next?

18:34.738 --> 18:37.241
Oh, well, you'll all be very happy to know

18:37.324 --> 18:40.494
I have decided to start looking
for that job I was talking about.

18:40.577 --> 18:41.453
Oh!

18:41.537 --> 18:43.122
-That's great.
-Claire.

18:43.205 --> 18:46.208
Your tables! We're understaffed again.

18:47.751 --> 18:50.879
-Oh, my God! You need a job.
-Oh, Claire, no.

18:50.963 --> 18:53.632
It's perfect.
Why didn't I think of this before?

18:53.715 --> 18:56.552
-I don't wanna--
-It's been in front of me this whole time.

18:56.635 --> 18:57.845
You should work at...

18:57.928 --> 18:59.513
Grant's gym.

19:00.264 --> 19:04.601
Yes. I know where we are. You asked Grant
to drive us to "your gym."

19:05.227 --> 19:07.688
I thought you were gonna suggest
I work at your restaurant.

19:08.355 --> 19:11.400
-Oh, my God, that's an even better idea!
-No, no, no.

19:11.984 --> 19:14.778
Here you can read, write your novel,
and get paid.

19:14.862 --> 19:16.572
There's plenty of down time.

19:16.655 --> 19:20.701
The last person who worked here invented
organic water and is now a millionaire.

19:21.618 --> 19:24.246
Plus, there's this amazing
cinnamon roll shop next door.

19:24.329 --> 19:28.083
Every time I think about it,
I have to get one. It's happening.

19:32.421 --> 19:36.133
This gym is really cool.
I'm just not sure that it's for me.

19:36.216 --> 19:38.886
How do you know if something's for you
if you don't try it?

19:38.969 --> 19:42.181
As a kid, I thought I'd hate
Brussels sprouts, so I wouldn't eat them.

19:42.264 --> 19:44.683
Then I finally had some and I hated them.

19:45.184 --> 19:46.768
Wouldn't have known unless I tried.

19:48.645 --> 19:51.356
You hit me with these
life lessons when I least expect it.

19:51.440 --> 19:53.025
You're like a buff Buddha.

19:54.359 --> 19:57.571
Plus, if you worked here,
we'd get to hang out all the time.

19:59.323 --> 20:00.407
Oh.

20:01.450 --> 20:02.701
That does sound nice.

20:04.536 --> 20:05.746
Okay. Yeah.

20:06.496 --> 20:11.084
Yeah. You know what? Yes,
I will take the job, if that's okay.

20:11.168 --> 20:14.046
Sick. We open at30 a.m. every morning.

20:14.129 --> 20:14.963
Excuse me?
