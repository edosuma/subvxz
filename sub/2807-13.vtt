00:07.048 --> 00:10.634
All right, it's a new day.
That stuff about Rachel?

00:10.885 --> 00:16.473
You don't feel that now. It was crazy.
You're fine. You're better than fine.

00:16.725 --> 00:21.937
You are, as your friend Tony
would say, "Great!"

00:23.690 --> 00:28.152
Everything's normal.
She's just your friend, Rachel.

00:28.403 --> 00:34.033
Your friend, Rachel.
Your friend. Rachel.

00:34.868 --> 00:41.081
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hey, it's your girlfriend, Rachel!

01:24.000 --> 01:25.667
Hi.

01:26.586 --> 01:28.754
Are you...? Are you high?

01:29.881 --> 01:32.091
I had the most amazing bath.

01:32.300 --> 01:35.677
- Really? I don't like baths.
- You like them with me.

01:35.887 --> 01:39.973
Honey, it's not the bath I enjoy.
It's the wet, naked lady.

01:40.683 --> 01:44.728
- Baths are so relaxing.
- Really? What do you do?

01:44.938 --> 01:48.857
You just sit in there,
stewing in your own filth.

01:50.068 --> 01:52.528
How dirty do you think I am?

01:52.779 --> 01:57.407
If you had some candles and bubbles
and music, you'd love it.

01:57.575 --> 01:59.701
It'd take all your stress away.

01:59.911 --> 02:05.624
It's 2:00 on Wednesday, I'm watching
Road Rules. How stressed am I?

02:07.794 --> 02:11.713
Hey, Chandler.
I really need to talk to you.

02:12.090 --> 02:16.343
Oh, uh, yeah. Is this a cold pizza
or a leftover-meat loaf talk?

02:16.553 --> 02:21.473
- Well, neither.
- Oh, my God, what's up?

02:22.517 --> 02:28.772
I don't know. It's just...
Lately, I've been feeling...

02:29.440 --> 02:31.900
Okay, here's what it is. Heh.

02:36.531 --> 02:41.702
- I feel a lot better. Thanks.
- Wait a minute. Just come back.

02:43.163 --> 02:49.001
Okay. You and Monica,
friends for a long time.

02:49.252 --> 02:53.755
And sure, there are rules.
But then you went to London.

02:54.007 --> 02:58.719
But that's different. There are rules
there too, know what I mean?

02:58.887 --> 03:00.179
Do you?

03:03.224 --> 03:08.145
It was different for you guys.
You were both in the same place.

03:08.313 --> 03:09.354
- In London.
- Yeah.

03:09.522 --> 03:13.108
Yes, when Monica and I were
in London, we were both in London.

03:13.818 --> 03:16.945
This is a bad idea. Forget all about it.

03:17.155 --> 03:20.407
This conversation, between you and me.

03:21.075 --> 03:23.160
If that.

03:28.666 --> 03:31.627
Hi. Oh, Ross, don't forget
that doctor's appointment.

03:31.878 --> 03:34.379
- Right.
- To find out the sex of the baby?

03:34.714 --> 03:38.717
We don't wanna know
as long as it's happy and healthy.

03:38.968 --> 03:41.970
- Yep, healthy. And cute.
- And smart.

03:42.180 --> 03:44.139
- Popular.
- With an aptitude for science.

03:44.349 --> 03:47.768
Are you two talking about the same baby?

03:48.478 --> 03:52.564
- Have you thought of names?
- Oh, yeah. I've come up with a bunch.

03:52.774 --> 03:55.359
- Really? Me too.
- Me too.

03:55.610 --> 03:57.236
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

03:57.445 --> 04:02.366
If it's a girl, Phoebe.
And if it's a boy, Pheebo.

04:04.535 --> 04:09.248
Maybe. But it wouldn't hurt
to have a backup, you know?

04:09.499 --> 04:11.708
- Rach, what were you thinking?
- Okay.

04:11.918 --> 04:14.878
Um, I was thinking if it's a girl...

04:15.088 --> 04:19.466
...how about Sandrene? It's French.
- Huh.

04:19.716 --> 04:24.471
That's a really pretty name
for an industrial solvent.

04:25.598 --> 04:27.015
Hmm.

04:27.225 --> 04:30.560
- Fine. What do you have?
- It's for a boy.

04:30.770 --> 04:33.647
I know it's a little out there, but...

04:34.482 --> 04:36.108
...Darwin.

04:37.485 --> 04:40.988
Our child will be beaten in the schoolyard.

04:41.197 --> 04:43.699
Yeah, by Sandrene.

04:43.950 --> 04:46.743
You're saying that
because I said no to you.

04:46.953 --> 04:49.204
I'm really, really not.

04:49.539 --> 04:51.832
How about you each get five vetoes?

04:52.041 --> 04:53.583
- All right.
- That sounds fair.

04:53.793 --> 04:56.420
I don't think you'll need it.

04:56.671 --> 05:00.090
If it's a girl, Rain.

05:00.967 --> 05:04.136
- Veto.
- Why?

05:04.387 --> 05:07.764
Rain? "Hi, my name is Rain.

05:08.016 --> 05:13.061
I have my own kiln,
and my dress is made out of wheat."

05:14.147 --> 05:16.398
I know her!

05:16.649 --> 05:20.569
I bought a homemade soap
from her at a Dead show!

05:21.654 --> 05:27.367
- Okay. How about for a guy, Thatcher?
- Why do you hate our child?

05:27.577 --> 05:30.370
- Fine, you go.
- Okay. James.

05:30.538 --> 05:31.663
Huh.

05:31.831 --> 05:34.166
- But only if it's a girl.
- Oh, veto.

05:34.417 --> 05:36.918
I like Ruth. What about Ruth?

05:37.128 --> 05:41.006
Oh, I'm sorry.
Are we having an 89-year-old?

05:42.675 --> 05:45.344
- How about Dayton?
- Veto. Stewart.

05:45.553 --> 05:47.179
Veto. Sawyer.

05:47.388 --> 05:49.723
- Veto. Helen.
- Veto.

05:50.058 --> 05:54.353
Is it me, or is Veto starting
to sound really good?

05:57.440 --> 05:58.482
Hey.

05:59.108 --> 06:01.610
Boy, do I have a surprise for you.

06:01.819 --> 06:03.695
Sex on the balcony?

06:03.905 --> 06:07.949
No. But someone's not gonna
get over that idea.

06:08.201 --> 06:10.369
- What?
- I drew you a bath.

06:10.578 --> 06:15.415
I don't like baths. Could you draw me
a picture of sex on the balcony?

06:15.666 --> 06:18.543
Try it for me. I used all my best stuff.

06:18.795 --> 06:24.091
I lit candles, I put on music.
I used bath salts, plus bubble bath.

06:24.342 --> 06:29.554
And got you this little plastic
Navy ship! So it's a boy bath.

06:30.723 --> 06:35.936
- This does butch it up a bit.
- I swear, you will love it.

06:36.145 --> 06:39.231
If I do this, can we discuss balcony sex?

06:39.440 --> 06:40.732
Absolutely.

06:42.485 --> 06:45.445
But I know how
that discussion's gonna go.

06:49.909 --> 06:52.953
Who can say where the road goes?

06:53.788 --> 07:00.043
All right, this isn't bad.
I like the flowery smell.

07:00.753 --> 07:04.631
Which is okay, because I've got my boat.

07:07.176 --> 07:10.262
- So?
- Oh, my God.

07:10.513 --> 07:15.725
I told you you were a bath person.
Hey, maybe I can give you a facial.

07:15.935 --> 07:19.020
I'm gonna need a bigger boat.

07:27.530 --> 07:30.949
I don't think you had
an open mind about Ruth.

07:31.159 --> 07:34.202
Little Ruthie Geller? How cute is that?

07:34.412 --> 07:39.499
Oh, my God, I can practically
hear the mahjong tiles.

07:39.709 --> 07:45.255
All your tests look fine. Are you
interested in the sex of the baby?

07:45.465 --> 07:49.509
- No, we're not.
- You have it right there?

07:49.760 --> 07:55.474
You know if it's a boy or a girl?
Dayton or Sandrene? Phoebe or Pheebo?

07:55.683 --> 07:58.059
But if you don't wanna know...

07:58.436 --> 08:01.771
- No, we wanna wait. Right?
- Right. Right.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.984
Oh, I'll be right back.

08:06.235 --> 08:08.945
I know it's really not my place...

08:09.155 --> 08:12.866
...but please don't name
your child Pheebo.

08:17.497 --> 08:20.999
So, which of these babies is the ugliest?

08:21.250 --> 08:24.169
What? Rach, come on, that's terrible.

08:24.420 --> 08:27.255
They're babies. They're all beautiful.

08:27.465 --> 08:31.510
- Third one from the left?
- Yeah. Why is it staring at me?

08:31.761 --> 08:37.974
I think it knows I'm talking about it.
Don't you...? You're looking!

08:38.183 --> 08:39.643
- I didn't!
- I saw you!

08:39.852 --> 08:42.395
Fine, I did, but I didn't see anything.

08:42.605 --> 08:46.191
Shame on you! Ugly baby judges you!

08:46.692 --> 08:50.904
- But I didn't...
- Don't tell me! I don't wanna know!

08:51.239 --> 08:53.573
I couldn't, because I don't know!

08:53.824 --> 08:58.495
I swear I didn't see anything!
It was just a momentary lapse.

08:58.746 --> 09:01.957
"Momentary lapse."
Don't you have any self-control?

09:02.166 --> 09:06.628
Okay. A couple months late
on the lecture, Ross.

09:09.966 --> 09:11.424
Hello?

09:11.634 --> 09:15.637
Can you come in here?
There's something wrong.

09:15.888 --> 09:18.932
You know what?
I think I'll wait out here.

09:19.392 --> 09:23.186
- I'm in the bathtub.
- Oh.

09:25.856 --> 09:29.109
- What's wrong?
- I drew a bath, but I did it wrong.

09:29.318 --> 09:34.990
The water's tepid, the salt didn't
dissolve and is now lodged places.

09:35.283 --> 09:41.037
And the scents I used don't compliment
each other. Eucalyptus and chamomile? Oh!

09:41.289 --> 09:43.957
- What?
- Bath salts.

09:44.208 --> 09:46.960
They're starting to effervesce.

09:47.169 --> 09:52.924
It's different. It's interesting.

09:53.217 --> 09:55.885
Let's talk about something else.

09:56.137 --> 10:00.432
Yeah. Sure. So, what was
going on with you today?

10:01.267 --> 10:05.020
I actually had the weirdest
conversation with Joey.

10:05.271 --> 10:08.773
He was talking about rules
and right and wrong.

10:08.983 --> 10:13.069
- I had the same conversation.
- What was he talking about?

10:13.279 --> 10:18.783
He hasn't had this much trouble getting
out words since he was in Macbeth.

10:19.493 --> 10:25.707
- That was a long night.
- What exactly did he say to you?

10:25.916 --> 10:31.004
He was talking about rules
and looking at people differently.

10:31.255 --> 10:33.548
- Not to me.
- What'd he tell you?

10:33.758 --> 10:36.843
He asked about you, me and London.

10:37.094 --> 10:41.222
And the glue that holds
this all together, the rules.

10:41.474 --> 10:45.393
Okay. So you, me and London.

10:45.645 --> 10:48.313
Looking at people differently.

10:48.564 --> 10:52.233
Maybe he wants to do
what you and I did in London.

10:52.443 --> 10:54.694
But what'd he mean by "rules"?

10:54.945 --> 10:58.782
Wait. He stopped talking
the minute Phoebe came in.

10:59.116 --> 11:03.036
- He's looking at her differently.
- Phoebe is his friend.

11:03.287 --> 11:05.455
That'd be breaking the rules.

11:05.665 --> 11:08.917
My God, he wants to do it
with Phoebe in London!

11:09.418 --> 11:12.420
- You guys?
- Um, just a minute!

11:12.797 --> 11:16.966
- That's Mrs. Tribbiani.
- You don't say anything.

11:17.218 --> 11:22.806
Why would I? That two of our friends
could start a great love affair?

11:23.057 --> 11:27.644
They'd have me to thank.
Then we could all start having babies!

11:27.895 --> 11:31.147
- I won't let you say anything.
- Stay here.

11:31.399 --> 11:33.525
Oh, God!

11:36.946 --> 11:39.447
Oh. I brought back your iron.

11:39.782 --> 11:43.159
You had that? I thought I lost it.
I got a new one a month ago.

11:43.369 --> 11:46.788
Oh, just as well. I broke this one.

11:51.460 --> 11:53.211
- What?
- Nothing.

11:53.671 --> 11:55.296
Okay.

11:55.506 --> 11:59.342
I really shouldn't say.
I'm really not supposed to.

11:59.593 --> 12:00.844
Fine.

12:01.429 --> 12:06.933
- It's a humdinger.
- Too bad you can't tell me.

12:07.268 --> 12:09.728
Somebody likes you!

12:11.480 --> 12:16.401
- Ugh. Is it Chandler?
- No!

12:16.610 --> 12:20.822
- Then tell him to stop staring.
- It's Joey.

12:21.615 --> 12:25.702
Really? Joey? You don't say.

12:25.911 --> 12:30.582
- Would you be interested?
- I don't know, I don't know.

12:31.083 --> 12:36.004
You know, I mean, on the one hand,
"Mother, may I?"

12:36.589 --> 12:39.758
But, you know, on the other hand...

12:40.760 --> 12:44.387
No. No, I can't. We're friends.

12:44.638 --> 12:47.307
Oh, no. I don't wanna risk
what we have.

12:47.516 --> 12:52.771
I guess that makes sense.
You think you're gonna talk to him?

12:52.980 --> 12:57.484
Sure. I mean, it's Joey.
I don't want him to get hurt.

12:57.943 --> 13:01.529
Well, I must say, I am on fire!
First Chandler, now Joey.

13:01.781 --> 13:06.618
- Not Chandler. Just Joey.
- Sure.

13:14.335 --> 13:16.127
- Hi.
- Hey.

13:16.337 --> 13:19.881
You know what?
I'm coming around on the name Ruth.

13:20.132 --> 13:22.842
I'd consider naming our child that.

13:23.427 --> 13:29.307
Rach, I can't tell you
how much that means to me. Oh...

13:30.976 --> 13:34.270
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

13:34.480 --> 13:39.526
You hated the name Ruth.
Why would you change your mind?

13:39.777 --> 13:43.446
Unless you know we're never
gonna have to use it.

13:43.697 --> 13:46.533
You did see. You know it's a boy!

13:46.784 --> 13:50.036
I didn't see anything. I changed my mind.

13:50.246 --> 13:53.122
I don't think so. You're giving me Ruth...

13:53.374 --> 13:56.584
...so you get to name him
when it's a boy.

13:56.836 --> 14:02.715
That's when you'll swoop in and
name him Heath or Blaine or Sequoia.

14:02.925 --> 14:05.218
I would... Sequoia!

14:05.427 --> 14:08.429
- Veto.
- Fine.

14:11.225 --> 14:17.564
Unless you anticipated that
I would figure all this out...

14:17.773 --> 14:21.150
...and you know that it actually is a girl.

14:21.360 --> 14:24.863
And you really do want her
to be named Ruth.

14:25.072 --> 14:30.743
Well, I'm not falling for that!
Okay? Ruth is off the table!

14:30.995 --> 14:36.374
- But, Ross, you want the name Ruth.
- Not like this!

14:38.294 --> 14:42.130
- Hey.
- Hey. What's up?

14:42.339 --> 14:46.426
- Um, Joey, I know.
- What?

14:47.845 --> 14:52.015
- I know.
- What?

14:52.641 --> 14:56.853
- I know about your feelings.
- Oh, my God, you do?

14:57.062 --> 15:02.275
I'm sorry. Things worked out for
Chandler and Monica, but that's rare.

15:02.526 --> 15:07.697
I know. And this is so much more
complicated than it was for them.

15:07.948 --> 15:11.409
I mean, it's Rachel, for God's sakes.

15:12.244 --> 15:15.788
For God's sakes, it's Rachel!

15:16.457 --> 15:20.919
I know! She's not only my friend,
she's my pregnant friend.

15:21.170 --> 15:23.922
She's my pregnant friend who's Ross' ex!

15:24.173 --> 15:29.552
Yeah, that's Rachel.
Beat me over the head with it.

15:30.763 --> 15:35.391
What am I gonna do? I keep trying
to get rid of these feelings.

15:35.601 --> 15:39.187
I made a list of everything
I don't like about her.

15:39.438 --> 15:41.439
- You wanna hear it?
- Yeah.

15:44.610 --> 15:49.989
"She made me switch to light mayo."
That's it! That's all I got!

15:50.199 --> 15:54.369
You know what? Tastes the same
and my pants fit better.

15:55.245 --> 15:57.455
Joey, you're getting upset for nothing.

15:57.623 --> 16:00.667
- This is probably just a crush.
- You think?

16:00.918 --> 16:05.129
Absolutely. You get this rush
of feelings, but it goes away.

16:05.339 --> 16:09.842
Yeah, just a crush.
That's all this is. It's a crush!

16:10.094 --> 16:12.929
I'm Joey. I don't get deep feelings.

16:13.138 --> 16:16.057
There you go.
Crushes happen all the time.

16:16.308 --> 16:21.479
I've had them for all you guys.
Except for Ross and Chandler.

16:21.689 --> 16:26.693
- And I'm sure you've had them for us.
- Not really.

16:27.361 --> 16:30.029
Throw me a bone here.

16:37.496 --> 16:41.541
So I, uh... I called the doctor.

16:42.126 --> 16:46.295
- Now we both know the sex of the baby.
- What?

16:46.505 --> 16:50.633
That's right.
The student has become the master.

16:51.093 --> 16:56.806
- Ross, I swear. I don't know.
- Oh, come on, you know it's a girl.

16:57.016 --> 17:00.977
- A what?
- You really didn't know?

17:01.186 --> 17:03.813
- We're having a girl?
- No.

17:04.064 --> 17:05.897
- That's what you said.
- No.

17:06.150 --> 17:10.236
- You said girl.
- Yes. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

17:10.445 --> 17:12.821
I'm not! We're having a girl!

17:13.073 --> 17:18.411
Sometimes I can't believe it's with
you, but still, we're having a girl!

17:18.619 --> 17:22.915
I know! You know what?
I'm putting Ruth back on the table.

17:23.083 --> 17:28.003
Yes, we'll have ourselves a little baby Ruth.

17:31.633 --> 17:34.093
- Permission to veto.
- Yes, please.

17:40.559 --> 17:43.603
- Hey.
- Do I smell essential oils?

17:43.812 --> 17:46.397
I'm gonna take a bath.
I was gonna get a magazine.

17:46.565 --> 17:47.982
Okay.

18:03.499 --> 18:06.375
What do you think you're doing?

18:06.877 --> 18:09.253
Leaving my troubles behind?

18:10.214 --> 18:14.509
You're new at this,
but this is unacceptable bath decorum.

18:14.760 --> 18:18.387
It's so hard to care
when you're this relaxed.

18:18.889 --> 18:22.600
You can have the bath,
but I am taking your boat.

18:23.018 --> 18:25.853
Now you're just a girl in a tub.

18:27.981 --> 18:31.609
- Hey!
- Hi, bubbles. Manly.

18:31.819 --> 18:34.487
I thought I'd let you know how it went.

18:34.696 --> 18:38.366
- You told her?
- She pulled it out of me!

18:38.575 --> 18:42.453
She's like a conversational wizard!
How did it go?

18:42.704 --> 18:45.998
- You were wrong. He doesn't like me.
- What?

18:46.208 --> 18:50.586
How would you like it if I told you
that Lee Majors liked you...

18:50.838 --> 18:54.966
...and you found out that he didn't like you?
How would you feel?

18:57.636 --> 19:02.265
- I don't think I'd care.
- Really? Lee Majors is hot.

19:02.975 --> 19:07.270
- Hello?
- We're in the bathroom!

19:07.479 --> 19:12.316
- Why?
- Because it's a relaxing and enjoyable time!

19:14.027 --> 19:17.697
- What are you guys doing in here?
- Oh, my God.

19:17.948 --> 19:22.535
A friend he's looking at differently,
but it's wrong.

19:22.786 --> 19:25.163
- It's Rachel!
- You like Rachel?

19:25.372 --> 19:30.251
It's no big deal. Phoebe and I talked.
It's a crush. It'll go away.

19:30.460 --> 19:33.754
Dude, you gotta rearrange your bubbles.

19:35.465 --> 19:37.717
Mazel tov.

19:39.052 --> 19:42.722
Hey. Oh, hi.
Ross and I were looking for you.

19:42.973 --> 19:47.226
What are we all doing in here? Oh, my.

19:48.937 --> 19:52.607
Honey, cover it up with the boat.

19:52.774 --> 19:53.983
Hello?

19:54.193 --> 19:58.112
We're all in here,
and we'd love for you to join us!

20:00.032 --> 20:06.078
Well, hey! What's going on?
Oh, cool boat. Oh, no.

20:08.040 --> 20:10.791
- Did you tell them?
- I waited for you.

20:11.001 --> 20:13.544
- Tell us what?
- We're having a girl.

20:13.754 --> 20:19.217
Oh, wow! Really? Oh, my God!

20:19.927 --> 20:23.012
I'll get you later.

20:28.435 --> 20:32.438
All right. It's a new day.
And it's just a crush.

20:32.689 --> 20:35.358
That's all. Just a little crush.

20:35.609 --> 20:39.403
All that worrying I was doing?
That was crazy. Crazy.

20:39.655 --> 20:44.283
Like my friend the bird here
would say, "It was cuckoo!"

20:47.704 --> 20:52.208
Everything's gonna be fine.
It's just a crush.

20:53.001 --> 20:56.796
- Hi, sweetie.
- I love you.

21:04.388 --> 21:07.932
It's nice to do this together,
isn't it?

21:08.767 --> 21:12.228
Yeah. And what you're doing
feels so good.

21:12.437 --> 21:16.315
- I'm not touching you.
- You're not?

21:16.525 --> 21:21.487
- It's the salts.
- Sweet Lord, new realms of pleasure.

21:23.573 --> 21:26.951
Whatever keeps you
off the balcony, big guy.
