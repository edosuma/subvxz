CLYDE: <i>13 Bannerman Road is</i>
<i>where Sarah Jane Smith lives</i>

00:07.307 --> 00:10.543
<i>and it's home to things</i>
<i>way beyond your imagination.</i>

00:10.610 --> 00:14.314
<i>There's an extra-terrestrial</i>
<i>super computer in the wall,</i>

00:14.381 --> 00:17.751
<i>a genetically engineered</i>
<i>boy genius in the attic,</i>

00:17.817 --> 00:21.254
<i>a schoolgirl investigator</i>
<i>across the road,</i>

00:21.454 --> 00:24.858
<i>and a whole universe</i>
<i>of adventure right here</i>
<i>on the doorstep.</i>

00:29.396 --> 00:30.864
-Ready?
-Always.

00:37.303 --> 00:38.471
I don't know how you do that.

00:38.538 --> 00:40.607
You've either got it,
or you haven't Lukey-boy.

00:40.673 --> 00:43.276
You see,
art isn't something
you can learn.

00:43.343 --> 00:47.013
Surely it's a matter
of bio-mechanical transference
of what the eye sees to paper?

00:47.080 --> 00:48.548
In the end,
it all comes down to geometry.

00:48.615 --> 00:50.150
You see,
there's your problem, Luke.

00:50.216 --> 00:52.919
You work up here,
you're all science and logic

00:52.986 --> 00:54.921
and spocky stuff
like that,

00:54.988 --> 00:56.923
but you can't break art
down into maths.

00:56.990 --> 00:58.358
Everything comes
down to maths.

00:58.425 --> 01:01.227
See, not art.
Art is in the soul.

01:01.294 --> 01:03.196
You don't think it.

01:03.263 --> 01:04.831
-You feel it.
-(DOOR OPENS)

01:06.199 --> 01:07.801
CHANDRA: Morning 11T.

01:07.867 --> 01:09.869
Someone's in trouble.
That's dad's serious face.

01:10.904 --> 01:12.405
Yeah, like he's got
any other sort.

01:12.472 --> 01:14.040
CHANDRA: All right,
you lot, settle down.

01:14.107 --> 01:16.843
If I may, Mrs Taylor?

01:16.910 --> 01:19.512
I have an important
announcement to make.

01:19.579 --> 01:23.116
-Told you.
-Concerning you,
Clyde Langer.

01:23.183 --> 01:25.351
Me? Oh, what have
I done now?

01:25.418 --> 01:27.687
Wait, oh, no! Wait.
Don't tell me.

01:27.754 --> 01:29.355
I turned up.

01:29.422 --> 01:31.724
All I have to do to get
some teacher's back up.

01:31.791 --> 01:35.628
You aren't in trouble, Clyde.
For once, quite the opposite.

01:35.695 --> 01:38.364
I've just had an e-mail,
from a Mr Harding.

01:38.431 --> 01:40.733
-Curator of the
International Gallery.
-Who?

01:42.469 --> 01:45.305
At last!

01:45.371 --> 01:48.041
Indeed, Mr Harding.

01:48.107 --> 01:51.377
I never thought I would
see the day when
she came into my care.

01:52.345 --> 01:55.248
So, so beautiful.

01:55.315 --> 01:57.050
No one else could have
achieved this.

01:57.116 --> 01:59.686
The years
of dedicated planning.

01:59.752 --> 02:01.621
No one would
have been man enough.

02:03.356 --> 02:05.558
We got there in the end,
Miss Trupp.

02:05.625 --> 02:07.894
After all our tribulations.

02:08.661 --> 02:11.197
Yours. I only assisted.

02:11.264 --> 02:13.533
True, true. You did.

02:14.734 --> 02:16.035
And here she is.

02:17.937 --> 02:19.672
The <i>Mona Lisa!</i>

02:23.676 --> 02:27.881
Tomorrow morning,
this entire class
will be the first members

02:27.947 --> 02:29.649
of the public to see...

02:31.317 --> 02:34.087
The <i>Mona Lisa</i> here in the UK.

02:34.153 --> 02:36.856
And all thanks to Clyde.
You won first prize!

02:36.923 --> 02:38.091
(ALL CHEERING)

02:39.058 --> 02:40.660
You won!

02:40.727 --> 02:44.264
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
as much as I appreciate
the adulation

02:44.330 --> 02:48.201
and missing
double maths tomorrow,
there's been a mistake.

02:48.268 --> 02:51.304
I never put my work
into any competition.

02:51.371 --> 02:52.872
Someone did.

02:54.307 --> 02:56.109
Well, I wonder who?

02:56.175 --> 02:58.044
They were looking
for the country's most
promising young artist.

02:58.111 --> 03:00.013
-And you really
are good, Clyde.
-Brilliant.

03:00.079 --> 03:01.915
I knew you would never
put yourself forward.

03:01.981 --> 03:04.784
Well, it's not good
for the image, is it?
Some nerdy competition.

03:05.618 --> 03:06.853
I've gotta text mum.

03:09.255 --> 03:10.623
How many times?

03:10.690 --> 03:12.725
No mobiles in the classroom.

03:12.792 --> 03:14.327
Or at the gallery tomorrow.

03:14.394 --> 03:16.829
-(ALL GROANING)
-Their rules, not mine.

03:19.632 --> 03:20.800
You're not annoyed
with me, are you?

03:20.867 --> 03:23.703
Are you serious?
It's the <i>Mona Lisa!</i>

03:28.374 --> 03:29.676
We should press on.

03:32.378 --> 03:33.580
Yes.

03:35.915 --> 03:39.852
Oh, tomorrow will be
such a day for me!

03:51.598 --> 03:53.633
(LAUGHING MENACINGLY)

04:09.716 --> 04:10.717
Mum?

04:11.985 --> 04:13.553
You won't believe
what's happened.

04:13.620 --> 04:16.122
-Mum?
-SARAH JANE: I'm in your room.

04:16.189 --> 04:17.490
(SIGHS)

04:20.892 --> 04:22.428
Look at
the state of this place.

04:22.495 --> 04:23.830
Yeah, I know, but...

04:23.896 --> 04:25.031
I thought
I told you to tidy it.

04:25.098 --> 04:27.467
-I will. Just listen.
-When?

04:27.533 --> 04:29.736
Oh, I hate to think
how long all these cups
have been here.

04:30.536 --> 04:32.005
Oh.

04:32.071 --> 04:33.139
Okay.

04:33.940 --> 04:35.675
No, it isn't.

04:35.742 --> 04:37.610
And you can forget
any other plans
you had for this evening

04:37.677 --> 04:39.112
because you're
blitzing this place.

04:39.178 --> 04:40.513
Don't think
K9's gonna zap
all this rubbish.

04:40.580 --> 04:42.115
He's out of bounds
till it's done.

04:42.181 --> 04:44.651
I am so disappointed in you.

04:44.717 --> 04:46.085
I don't know
what you want from me.

04:46.152 --> 04:47.720
You say you are trying
to give me a normal life,

04:47.787 --> 04:48.888
but when I act
like a real teenager

04:48.955 --> 04:50.356
you want me
to be perfect again.

04:50.423 --> 04:51.758
The way the Bane made me.

04:57.330 --> 04:59.932
-I'm sorry you feel like that.
-So am I.

05:15.615 --> 05:18.584
Hand in your mobile phones
at reception and no running.

05:18.651 --> 05:20.186
No running!

05:20.253 --> 05:23.456
We're here as honoured guests,
not like some hormonal SAS.

05:26.192 --> 05:27.627
Oh, what's the use?

05:35.535 --> 05:36.869
Ah freebies!

05:43.409 --> 05:44.944
No, I'll pass, thanks.

05:45.011 --> 05:46.946
Uh, your loss.

05:47.013 --> 05:50.583
Anyway,
what did Sarah Jane say
about me winning this prize?

05:50.650 --> 05:52.452
Nothing.
We're not really talking.

05:52.518 --> 05:55.088
She's being such a mum.

05:55.154 --> 05:58.791
Yeah, well, it's probably
best she doesn't know.

05:58.858 --> 06:01.928
Careful, Clyde.
Even star pupils need
to watch where they're going.

06:02.128 --> 06:04.430
-Sir.
-So, how're you feeling?
Um, nervous?

06:05.231 --> 06:06.232
Weirded out.

06:06.299 --> 06:08.768
I mean teachers
are never this friendly.

06:08.835 --> 06:12.038
You see,
diligence has its rewards.

06:12.105 --> 06:15.742
Perhaps now you'll
put the same enthusiasm
into your other school work.

06:15.808 --> 06:19.011
-Mr Chandra? Park Vale?
-Yes.

06:19.078 --> 06:20.880
Mr Harding will
receive you upstairs.

06:20.947 --> 06:21.948
-Great.
-Come this way.

06:22.014 --> 06:24.517
Okay, everyone,
follow me.

06:24.584 --> 06:26.953
-It's very exciting.
-I'm very excited, as well.

06:31.491 --> 06:33.926
-Actually much, much smaller
than you'd imagine.
-Really?

06:33.993 --> 06:37.063
It's very surprising because
you always think of the
<i>Mona Lisa</i> as absolutely huge.

06:38.197 --> 06:39.632
What do you reckon, Luke?

06:39.699 --> 06:41.501
Who's got
the more enigmatic smile?

06:41.567 --> 06:45.071
Me or Lisa?

06:45.138 --> 06:48.541
I really don't understand,
why is the <i>Mona Lisa</i>
so special?

06:49.609 --> 06:51.544
It's just brown.

06:51.611 --> 06:53.980
Maybe when you see
the real thing,
you'll understand.

06:54.046 --> 06:56.048
I don't really get art.

06:56.115 --> 06:58.384
Careful, it's an art gallery.

06:58.451 --> 07:00.253
You're not supposed to
pick it up either, okay.

07:00.319 --> 07:04.190
You look, you don't touch.

07:04.257 --> 07:07.927
But this isn't art.
It's something else.

You really are
so gifted, Clyde.

07:26.546 --> 07:28.748
-Cheers.
-When I saw your picture,
I knew you'd win.

07:28.815 --> 07:32.451
It wasn't up to me,
but if it had been
you'd definitely have won.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.492
perhaps you should
go and check the
final preparations.

07:39.559 --> 07:40.860
Oh. Yes.

07:42.895 --> 07:43.863

I've been drawing K9, either.

used to play this

I thought people
would laugh at me.

thought drawing
wasn't cool.

Something like that.

And I've tried so hard
to make Luke's life
as normal as possible.

In a way it helped make mine
a little more normal, too.

12:28.247 --> 12:30.649
You and me both, old friend.

12:30.716 --> 12:34.987
And being a mum is just
about as complicated
as it gets.

12:35.054 --> 12:37.123
Most parents have years
to get used to it.

12:37.189 --> 12:39.859
I'm still finding my feet
and already
I'm realising that

12:39.925 --> 12:41.861
one day it's going to be over.

12:42.995 --> 12:44.597
One day Luke will be gone.

12:44.663 --> 12:46.132
One day, perhaps, very soon.

12:50.369 --> 12:52.771
I told them security
had to be improved here.

12:52.838 --> 12:57.243
I told them,
after that Cup of Athelstan
fiasco at Easter.

12:57.309 --> 12:59.678
Oh, my beautiful <i>Mona Lisa!</i>

13:00.779 --> 13:03.516
The French will have my head!

13:03.582 --> 13:05.885
If you could all stay calm
as we move out

13:05.951 --> 13:08.287
and let the police
do their job.

13:08.354 --> 13:09.555
There's something
freaky about this.

13:09.622 --> 13:11.690
Oh, here we go.

13:11.757 --> 13:14.260
Just because something shady
happens doesn't mean
there are aliens behind it.

13:14.326 --> 13:15.861
When my bike got nicked,

13:15.928 --> 13:18.664
did you think
that was ET the ASBO,
cycling home?

13:18.731 --> 13:21.000
-Did I mention aliens?
-Rani's right.

13:21.066 --> 13:23.702
Why would they put
a picture of Miss Trupp
in the <i>Mona Lisa's</i> place?

13:23.769 --> 13:25.204
Maybe she's behind it all.

13:25.271 --> 13:27.072
Maybe it's her calling card.

13:29.875 --> 13:32.111
Even if this isn't alien,
it's weird enough
for Sarah Jane.

13:32.178 --> 13:34.480
We should call her.
No. We don't need her.

13:49.929 --> 13:51.630
-Yes, what is it, Luke?
-I need the toilet.

Me too, sir, I'm busting.

13:52.898 --> 13:55.301
-And me.
-Okay. But be quick.

-We have to find a phone.

23:17.929 --> 23:19.531
I don't care
what you say, Luke,

23:19.598 --> 23:21.600
what's happened
to those people
is beyond freaky.

23:21.666 --> 23:22.868
We're calling your mum.

23:22.934 --> 23:24.536
I don't think
there's any need.

23:26.972 --> 23:28.140
Her car's here.

23:34.212 --> 23:36.281
Residual alien energy.

23:36.348 --> 23:38.850
But if this is,
or was, a painting
by Leonardo,

23:39.584 --> 23:40.886
how is that possible?

23:42.487 --> 23:44.022
Do you know, Phyllis?

23:44.089 --> 23:46.558
I know you can hear me,
even though you can't answer.

23:46.625 --> 23:50.128
I promise you,
I'm going to get you
out of there.

23:50.195 --> 23:51.963
MR HARDING: But what
I'm thinking is...

23:52.030 --> 23:54.933
If he was painted
at the same time as you,
this has to be him.

23:57.536 --> 23:59.571
Has to be.

23:59.638 --> 24:03.542
Not only a contemporary
of Leonardo,
but a neighbour in Florence.

24:06.578 --> 24:08.914
Ah? Him?

24:08.980 --> 24:10.282
He's not much
of a looker, is he?

24:10.348 --> 24:13.919
Giuseppe Di Cattivo.
1450 to 1518,

24:13.985 --> 24:16.655
whose work is often
compared to his more
famous contemporary,

24:16.721 --> 24:18.423
Hieronymus Bosch.

24:18.490 --> 24:20.358
Poor Giuseppe.

24:20.425 --> 24:22.527
He died in a lunatic asylum.

24:23.128 --> 24:23.929
Hmm.

24:27.232 --> 24:29.568
No, no, this isn't him.

24:30.302 --> 24:31.503
But...

24:34.806 --> 24:37.542
Come out, come out,
whoever you are!

24:40.712 --> 24:42.113
I can hear you breathing!

24:44.649 --> 24:47.419
Who would've thought
a painting would have
such good hearing,

24:47.485 --> 24:49.087
<i>Mona Lisa?</i>

24:49.154 --> 24:52.123
But then Leonardo
was such
a stickler for detail.

24:52.190 --> 24:54.226
On the subject of detail...

24:55.293 --> 24:57.195
Mind filling
in the obvious blank?

24:57.262 --> 24:59.130
My name is Sarah Jane Smith.

24:59.197 --> 25:00.432
And that is
a Sontaran blaster,

25:00.498 --> 25:01.933
do you mind telling
me where you got it?

25:02.133 --> 25:04.302
Ooh, I just took it
from the painting

25:04.369 --> 25:07.339
that lad Clyde did,
'cause I thought
it looked a little bit flash.

25:07.405 --> 25:08.940
Oh, Clyde.

25:09.007 --> 25:10.675
You'd better not have
harmed him or his friends!

25:10.742 --> 25:13.712
Oh, no,
don't concern yourself.
They're perfectly safe.

25:13.778 --> 25:16.681
I'm Lionel Harding,
curator of the museum.

25:16.748 --> 25:19.184
Mr Harding,
whatever is happening here,
don't worry.

25:19.251 --> 25:20.685
I can help you.

25:20.752 --> 25:22.687
Thank you,
I'm not sure I need it.

25:22.888 --> 25:26.191
Ah, you see Harders here,

25:26.258 --> 25:27.859
he's me number one fan.

25:27.926 --> 25:29.261
Listen to me,
she is dangerous.

25:29.327 --> 25:30.729
Look what
she did to Miss Trupp.

25:31.263 --> 25:33.632
Oh!

25:33.698 --> 25:37.435
Now you don't want
to worry about that
old trout, do you Harders?

25:37.502 --> 25:39.638
I mean, you never
did before, did you?

25:39.704 --> 25:43.074
And, let's face it,
she never was an oil painting.

25:43.141 --> 25:45.510
At least not till now!
(LAUGHING)

25:47.145 --> 25:48.947
Release her. Now!

25:49.014 --> 25:51.182
Ooh, I might think about it.

25:51.249 --> 25:52.951
Depends if you
stay out of me way.

25:53.018 --> 25:54.753
Sarah Jane Smith?

25:56.221 --> 25:58.490
Sarah Jane.

25:58.556 --> 26:00.025
Now where do I know
that name?

26:01.459 --> 26:04.362
Oh! Ooh.

26:04.429 --> 26:08.300
Ooh!
That Sarah Jane.

26:08.366 --> 26:11.169
Seems like no one
wants you around, Sazza.

26:11.236 --> 26:12.904
Not even your son.

26:12.971 --> 26:16.408
-What?
-Hmm, heard him
talking before.

26:16.474 --> 26:18.410
He'd like you
to keep your nose out.

26:18.476 --> 26:20.245
And so would I.

26:20.312 --> 26:22.180
I'm sorry,
whatever you're planning,
I am not stepping aside.

26:22.247 --> 26:23.315
That's your choice.

26:23.381 --> 26:24.416
No, <i>Mia Bella!</i>

26:26.051 --> 26:27.786
(DEEP GROWLING)

26:32.891 --> 26:34.659
What is that?

26:34.726 --> 26:37.228
That is my brother.

26:37.295 --> 26:39.698
Is it me, or did things
just get uncomfortable?

26:47.973 --> 26:49.674
What's going on?

26:49.741 --> 26:52.143
Well, give me a second,
then I'll put you
in the picture.

26:53.945 --> 26:55.013
No!

26:56.848 --> 26:58.116
That's Mum!

27:04.856 --> 27:06.424
-Sarah Jane?
-Mum?

27:07.859 --> 27:08.860
Luke?

27:10.528 --> 27:11.863
I've found her.

27:15.467 --> 27:18.269
No. Mum!

27:18.336 --> 27:19.704
(SARAH JANE SCREAMING)

27:22.307 --> 27:24.509
(LAUGHING)

27:24.576 --> 27:26.511
And that is how she'll stay

27:27.912 --> 27:30.415
forever!
(LAUGHING)

27:38.857 --> 27:40.992
Run!

27:41.059 --> 27:45.597
I have not been released
from wood and paint
to be trapped in here!

27:45.663 --> 27:48.633
A legend, a painting
too terrifying
to be exhibited.

27:49.367 --> 27:50.702
Once we are united

27:50.769 --> 27:53.638
your reign
of fire and sulphur
shall begin

27:53.705 --> 27:57.809
and the world
will be a rage of flames
at our feet.
