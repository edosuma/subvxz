WEBVTT

00:03.354 --> 00:05.189
<i>I was born in space.</i>

00:05.356 --> 00:07.400
<i>I've never felt the sun on my face</i>

00:07.567 --> 00:10.570
<i>or breathed real air,
or floated in the water.</i>

00:11.821 --> 00:12.864
<i>None of us have.</i>

00:12.947 --> 00:15.325
<i>For three generations,
the Ark has kept what's left</i>

00:15.491 --> 00:19.370
<i>of the human race alive,
but now our home is dying,</i>

00:19.454 --> 00:21.831
<i>and we are the last hope of mankind.</i>

00:22.415 --> 00:25.793
<i>One hundred prisoners sent on
a desperate mission to the ground.</i>

00:26.210 --> 00:28.421
<i>Each of us is here
because we broke the law.</i>

00:28.630 --> 00:30.715
<i>On the ground, there is no law.</i>

00:30.882 --> 00:32.467
<i>All we have to do is survive.</i>

00:32.634 --> 00:35.303
<i>But we will be tested,
by the Earth,</i>

00:35.470 --> 00:39.349
<i>by the secrets it hides,
and most of all, by each other.</i>

00:41.476 --> 00:42.685
<i>Previously on</i> The 100...

00:43.394 --> 00:44.395
The Ark is dying, Raven.

00:44.562 --> 00:46.856
I have to prove
that Earth is survivable.

00:47.065 --> 00:50.360
We have nine days to get this ready
so I can survive a drop.

00:51.486 --> 00:54.739
My father, he begged for mercy
when your father floated him.

00:54.906 --> 00:56.324
This is for my father.

00:59.243 --> 01:00.370
You're Charlotte, right?

01:00.536 --> 01:02.205
It's okay to be scared.

01:02.372 --> 01:03.532
Do you want to talk about it?

01:03.665 --> 01:06.042
It's my parents.
They were floated

01:06.209 --> 01:08.503
and I see it in my dreams.

01:08.670 --> 01:10.713
- No!
- Wake up, Charlotte.

01:11.172 --> 01:12.632
Does it happen often?

01:13.716 --> 01:16.511
Slay your demons, kid.
Then you'll be able to sleep.

01:18.596 --> 01:19.764
Sorry.

01:54.048 --> 01:55.466
You shouldn't be out here alone.

01:56.134 --> 01:57.885
What if I was a Grounder?

01:59.137 --> 02:00.617
They got Wells just outside the wall.

02:00.722 --> 02:02.282
Says the guy who just spent
another night

02:02.306 --> 02:03.891
exploring the woods all by himself.

02:04.058 --> 02:06.978
But I'm reckless, irresponsible.

02:08.937 --> 02:10.440
I got you something.

02:13.443 --> 02:14.819
Where did you get this?

02:15.194 --> 02:16.487
The art supply store.

02:22.452 --> 02:24.203
I know when we were kids...

02:25.705 --> 02:29.834
...Wells was always giving me
ink, charcoal.

02:31.377 --> 02:33.337
Just anything I could draw with,
really.

02:36.132 --> 02:39.302
I found out later that he was trading
his own stuff to give it to me.

02:41.888 --> 02:43.723
He didn't want me to know that, either.

02:46.142 --> 02:49.187
He let me hate him
so that I wouldn't hate my mother.

02:52.356 --> 02:53.691
I know.

02:56.986 --> 02:58.696
My mother killed my father.

03:05.870 --> 03:08.623
I just wish there was something
I could do.

03:10.708 --> 03:13.961
To tell her I know.
Make her feel what I'm...

03:19.425 --> 03:20.593
Where are you going?

03:20.760 --> 03:22.178
To make her feel it.

03:38.402 --> 03:40.655
No! No.

03:41.781 --> 03:43.741
No. Hell no. No.

03:52.041 --> 03:53.918
No. This isn't right.

03:56.003 --> 03:57.380
Abby.

03:58.422 --> 03:59.757
No.

04:00.466 --> 04:01.884
Abby.

04:06.472 --> 04:08.057
Okay. It's not conclusive.

04:08.808 --> 04:13.271
Just because her wristband went out
doesn't mean...

04:14.897 --> 04:16.315
Okay.

04:16.983 --> 04:19.402
It's the first terminated signal
in over a week.

04:19.902 --> 04:22.697
We can still assume that
things are stabilizing on Earth.

04:22.947 --> 04:24.615
We should assume that.

04:29.620 --> 04:32.540
I need an analysis of Clarke's
vital signs for the past two days.

04:32.707 --> 04:34.208
- Abby.
- Just have it ready for me

04:34.375 --> 04:35.835
when I get back.

04:41.299 --> 04:43.050
Yes! I did it.

04:44.176 --> 04:45.636
It's still operational.

04:51.642 --> 04:54.604
What?
Monty needed a working wristband.

04:54.770 --> 04:56.272
And you needed to punish your mother.

04:57.315 --> 05:00.067
Look, they're running out of air,
and we need their help.

05:00.234 --> 05:02.034
My mother thinking I'm dead
is only temporary.

05:02.153 --> 05:04.655
Not if I can't patch it through
the dropship mainframe.

05:06.115 --> 05:07.408
I can do it.

05:07.825 --> 05:09.535
We'll be talking to the Ark
by nightfall.

05:26.385 --> 05:28.262
This section should be finished
by tomorrow.

05:32.391 --> 05:33.684
Hey!

05:35.937 --> 05:37.664
You think the Grounders
are just gonna sit around

05:37.688 --> 05:39.190
and wait for us to finish the wall?

05:39.357 --> 05:42.151
Maybe we should let the little girl
do the lifting for you, huh?

05:42.318 --> 05:45.112
I just need some water, okay?
Then I'll be fine.

05:45.988 --> 05:48.532
Murphy, get this guy some water.

05:49.200 --> 05:50.785
Hey, you got this?

05:54.038 --> 05:55.456
I'm just kidding.

06:07.635 --> 06:08.970
Ugh!

06:09.136 --> 06:11.013
What the hell
is wrong with you, Murphy?

06:11.180 --> 06:12.390
I'm gonna kill you!

06:14.642 --> 06:16.102
You wanted a water break.

06:16.727 --> 06:18.562
Get back to work.

06:18.688 --> 06:20.189
<i>You heard him!</i>

06:27.071 --> 06:28.489
Look, we're already there.

06:28.864 --> 06:30.408
Just a few steps, okay?

06:31.450 --> 06:33.077
One foot in front of the other.

06:37.540 --> 06:39.625
Hey. What's wrong?

06:40.710 --> 06:42.712
Oh, nothing. I'm good.

06:43.337 --> 06:45.047
Jasper, it's been a week, okay?

06:45.214 --> 06:46.924
You've been given a second chance.

06:47.091 --> 06:48.342
You gotta use it.

06:48.592 --> 06:49.760
Aah!

06:51.220 --> 06:52.763
Octavia?

06:54.598 --> 06:55.975
Octavia?

06:56.767 --> 06:59.478
Octavia! Octavia, are you okay?

06:59.645 --> 07:00.645
Aah!

07:00.771 --> 07:02.356
Hey, jerk!

07:03.691 --> 07:05.151
Get the hell out of here.

07:05.317 --> 07:07.236
Jasper, come on.

07:07.403 --> 07:08.904
There's nothing to be afraid of.

07:36.057 --> 07:37.099
Councillor.

07:37.266 --> 07:38.309
Councillor.

07:38.476 --> 07:40.227
Are you headed to Mecha Station?

07:41.854 --> 07:43.230
Yes, as a matter of fact, I am.

07:44.523 --> 07:47.068
You've been down there
nine times in the past week.

07:48.027 --> 07:50.071
Is there something
I should be made aware of?

07:50.946 --> 07:52.239
Are you tracking me, Kane?

07:53.157 --> 07:54.950
I'm tracking everybody, Abby.

07:56.035 --> 07:57.328
Mind if I join you?

07:57.495 --> 08:00.247
Not at all. But you're gonna
have to be inoculated.

08:00.748 --> 08:02.166
Inoculated?

08:02.333 --> 08:04.251
A mechanic came down
with strep last week.

08:04.418 --> 08:06.087
She's fine now, but I'm still

08:06.253 --> 08:08.464
checking the bacterial levels
in the station.

08:09.215 --> 08:10.841
We don't want another outbreak.

08:13.094 --> 08:14.446
We can stop by sick bay on the way.

08:14.470 --> 08:15.846
That's all right.

08:17.139 --> 08:18.474
I don't want to slow you down.

08:18.641 --> 08:21.811
Just keep me informed.

08:23.646 --> 08:25.064
Absolutely.

08:33.364 --> 08:35.491
How soon can you get
this thing ready to drop?

08:36.325 --> 08:39.703
I'm still scraping up parts
to fabricate a pressure regulator.

08:40.830 --> 08:42.164
We got two more days, right?

08:42.331 --> 08:44.207
Can we launch without that part?

08:44.375 --> 08:47.336
We could launch, but we'll be dead
before we get to the ground.

08:47.670 --> 08:49.130
And I mean bad dead.

08:49.505 --> 08:51.841
Ruptured lungs,
air bubbles in the brain.

08:52.007 --> 08:53.342
We need that part.

08:53.509 --> 08:55.219
Why? What's wrong?
Did something change?

08:57.555 --> 08:59.473
Clarke's wristband signal went out.

09:04.228 --> 09:05.948
Yeah, but that doesn't
mean anything, right?

09:06.397 --> 09:07.877
She took it off
like the rest of them.

09:13.946 --> 09:15.239
Okay.

09:15.531 --> 09:17.575
I can get a pressure regulator.
Today.

09:17.825 --> 09:19.118
How?

09:19.660 --> 09:21.162
The less you know, the better.

09:30.588 --> 09:32.715
This knife was made of metal
from the dropship.

09:33.757 --> 09:34.884
What do you mean?

09:35.050 --> 09:36.427
Who else knows about this?

09:36.719 --> 09:38.596
No one.
We brought it straight here.

09:38.804 --> 09:40.264
Clarke?

09:41.432 --> 09:43.100
It means the Grounders
didn't kill Wells.

09:44.727 --> 09:45.936
It was one of us.

09:48.772 --> 09:50.232
So, there's a murderer in the camp?

09:50.482 --> 09:53.235
There's more than one
murderer in this camp.

09:53.402 --> 09:55.779
This isn't news.
We need to keep it quiet.

09:58.782 --> 10:01.202
- Get out of my way, Bellamy.
- Be smart about this.

10:01.368 --> 10:03.704
Look at what we've achieved.
The wall, the patrols.

10:03.871 --> 10:06.123
Like it or not,
thinking the Grounders killed Wells

10:06.290 --> 10:07.290
is good for us.

10:07.374 --> 10:08.667
Oh, good for you, you mean.

10:09.043 --> 10:11.086
What? Keep people afraid
and they'll work for you?

10:11.295 --> 10:12.796
- Is that it?
- Yeah, that's it.

10:12.963 --> 10:14.256
But it's good for all of us.

10:14.423 --> 10:16.884
Fear of the Grounders
is building that wall.

10:17.051 --> 10:18.361
And besides, what are you gonna do,

10:18.385 --> 10:20.545
just walk out there
and ask the killer to step forward?

10:20.721 --> 10:22.073
You don't even know
whose knife that is.

10:22.097 --> 10:23.390
Oh, really?

10:24.308 --> 10:28.312
J.M. John Murphy.
The people have a right to know.

10:32.524 --> 10:34.568
No water till this section is up!

10:35.945 --> 10:38.197
What?
What are you starting at, huh?

10:38.489 --> 10:39.907
You son of a bitch!

10:40.449 --> 10:42.618
- What's your problem?
- Recognize this?

10:43.994 --> 10:45.263
It's my knife.
Where'd you find it?

10:45.287 --> 10:47.248
Where you dropped it
after you killed Wells.

10:48.332 --> 10:49.667
Where I what?

10:52.211 --> 10:53.754
The Grounders killed Wells,
not me.

10:53.921 --> 10:56.340
I know what you did,
and you're gonna pay for it.

10:56.507 --> 10:57.841
Really?

10:58.676 --> 11:00.511
Bellamy, you really
believe this crap?

11:01.804 --> 11:04.265
You threatened to kill him.
We all heard you.

11:04.431 --> 11:05.557
You hated Wells.

11:05.724 --> 11:07.476
Plenty of people hated Wells.

11:08.060 --> 11:10.062
His father was the
chancellor that locked us up.

11:10.229 --> 11:12.332
Yeah, but you're the only one
who got in a knife fight with him.

11:12.356 --> 11:14.024
Yeah, I didn't kill him then, either.

11:14.191 --> 11:16.944
- Tried to kill Jasper, too.
- What?

11:19.613 --> 11:21.675
Come on. This is ridiculous.
I don't have to answer to you.

11:21.699 --> 11:23.158
I don't have to answer to anyone.

11:23.409 --> 11:24.660
Come again?

11:28.872 --> 11:32.793
Bellamy, look, I'm telling you, man.
I didn't do this.

11:32.960 --> 11:35.379
They found his fingers on
the ground with your knife.

11:37.298 --> 11:40.175
Is this the kind of society
that we want?

11:40.968 --> 11:42.288
You say there should be no rules.

11:42.344 --> 11:45.180
Does that mean that we can kill
each other without punishment?

11:45.347 --> 11:47.474
I already told you.
I didn't kill anyone.

11:47.641 --> 11:48.809
I say we float him.

11:49.018 --> 11:50.477
Yeah.

11:50.644 --> 11:51.724
That's not what I'm saying.

11:51.895 --> 11:54.565
Why not? He deserves to float.
It's justice.

11:54.732 --> 11:55.899
Revenge isn't justice.

11:56.066 --> 11:58.360
It's justice. Float him!

12:05.576 --> 12:07.703
No! Get off him!

12:08.787 --> 12:09.913
Okay.

12:11.081 --> 12:12.583
Get off of him!

12:13.500 --> 12:15.627
I didn't do anything!

12:21.175 --> 12:22.634
Let him go!

12:37.358 --> 12:38.942
You can't do this!

12:41.236 --> 12:42.654
Get off me.

12:45.449 --> 12:46.867
No!

12:50.287 --> 12:53.749
You can stop this!
They'll listen to you!

12:53.957 --> 12:55.542
Bellamy! You should do it.

12:56.126 --> 12:58.212
Bel-la-my!

13:04.301 --> 13:07.304
I saw you in the woods with Atom.
I know you're not a killer.

13:08.555 --> 13:11.100
Bellamy, don't do this.

13:12.267 --> 13:14.144
Don't. Bellamy.

13:18.732 --> 13:20.734
You can't do this, Bellamy.

13:29.451 --> 13:31.078
No, Bellamy, no!

13:31.245 --> 13:33.645
This is on you, princess.
You should've kept your mouth shut.

13:33.747 --> 13:35.582
What the hell are you doing?

13:35.749 --> 13:39.169
Cut him down! Charlotte,
get out of here now! Cut him down!

13:39.420 --> 13:40.838
Get out of my way.

13:41.004 --> 13:43.924
Stop! Okay?
Murphy didn't kill Wells!

13:46.176 --> 13:48.137
- I did!
- Oh, my God.

14:10.284 --> 14:12.077
- It's not meal time yet.
- I'm not hungry.

14:12.244 --> 14:13.454
I'm here to trade.

14:13.704 --> 14:15.372
Before you tell me
I'm in the wrong place,

14:15.539 --> 14:17.139
just let Nygel know
it's her little bird.

14:17.207 --> 14:19.001
Well, well, well.

14:21.879 --> 14:23.839
How long has it been, little bird?

14:24.006 --> 14:25.382
I need a pressure regulator.

14:25.549 --> 14:27.009
What for?

14:27.176 --> 14:28.635
Regulating pressure.

14:28.802 --> 14:30.220
That's good.

14:30.387 --> 14:32.222
I see you got your mom's
sense of humor.

14:32.890 --> 14:33.891
What do you want for it?

14:34.057 --> 14:37.311
I don't move machine parts anymore.
It's too dangerous.

14:37.478 --> 14:40.939
How about settling for some herb
and moonshine like everybody else?

14:41.106 --> 14:43.775
Save the act for someone
who doesn't know better.

14:44.735 --> 14:46.320
Just tell me what it's gonna take.

14:50.407 --> 14:54.411
I owe a favor to the chief of electrical,
and he's got a thing

14:54.578 --> 14:57.956
for tough, pretty girls like you.

15:00.375 --> 15:01.543
You're joking, right?

15:01.710 --> 15:03.921
I never joke about business, Raven.

15:04.087 --> 15:07.925
Kane's watching my every move,
so, if I'm gonna do this,

15:08.091 --> 15:10.093
you're gonna need to
make it worth my while.

15:10.260 --> 15:11.929
By screwing the chief of electrical?

15:14.806 --> 15:15.933
I can't do that.

15:16.099 --> 15:17.952
Then I guess you don't need
to regulate pressure

15:17.976 --> 15:19.770
as badly as you thought you did.

15:20.437 --> 15:22.105
Go float yourself, Nygel.

15:23.023 --> 15:26.193
You know, your mother
would've taken that deal.

15:27.611 --> 15:32.241
In fact, she did.
Many times.

15:32.407 --> 15:34.201
Don't you dare talk
about my mother that way!

15:34.368 --> 15:36.453
- Little girl.
- No! I'll float you, Nygel!

15:36.620 --> 15:37.788
Get off me!

15:37.955 --> 15:39.581
Bye, little bird!

15:41.458 --> 15:42.960
Bring out the girl, Bellamy!

15:43.126 --> 15:44.127
Why, Charlotte?

15:44.294 --> 15:47.256
I was just trying to slay my demons,
like you told me.

15:47.422 --> 15:49.591
What the hell is she talking about?

15:49.758 --> 15:52.344
She misunderstood me.
Charlotte, that is not what I meant.

15:52.511 --> 15:53.762
<i>Bring the girl out now!</i>

15:53.929 --> 15:55.389
Please don't let them hurt me.

15:55.973 --> 15:57.808
If you guys have any
bright ideas, speak up.

16:01.103 --> 16:03.313
- Now you stay quiet.
- Those are your boys out there.

16:03.480 --> 16:05.607
This is not my fault.
If she had listened to me,

16:05.732 --> 16:07.568
those idiots
would still be building the wall.

16:07.776 --> 16:10.153
<i>You want to build a society,
princess?</i>

16:10.779 --> 16:12.739
Let's build a society.
Bring her out.

16:13.156 --> 16:14.992
No! Please, Bellamy.

16:16.326 --> 16:18.662
Charlotte, hey, it's gonna be okay.

16:18.829 --> 16:20.956
Just stay with them.

16:25.586 --> 16:27.337
Well, well.
Look who decided to join us.

16:27.504 --> 16:29.548
Dial it down and back off.

16:29.715 --> 16:33.176
Or what? What are you gonna do,
Bellamy, hang me?

16:33.343 --> 16:35.470
I was just giving
the people what they wanted.

16:36.763 --> 16:40.309
Yeah. Yeah, that's a good idea.
Why don't we do that right now?

16:41.852 --> 16:44.521
So, who here wants to see
the real murderer hung up?

16:45.230 --> 16:46.315
All in favor?

16:53.113 --> 16:54.656
I see.

16:55.699 --> 16:58.702
So, it's okay to string me up
for nothing,

16:58.869 --> 17:02.497
but when this little bitch confesses,
you wanna let her walk?

17:05.709 --> 17:08.878
- Cowards! All of you are cowards!
- Hey, Murphy! Murphy.

17:10.213 --> 17:11.714
It's over.

17:16.637 --> 17:18.221
Whatever you say, boss.

17:22.392 --> 17:23.935
Son of a bitch! Hey!

17:25.354 --> 17:26.896
Come on.
Let's get the girl.

17:30.400 --> 17:31.735
Charlotte!

17:32.444 --> 17:34.738
Charlotte,
I know you can hear me!

17:34.905 --> 17:36.948
And when I find you,
you are gonna pay!

18:16.613 --> 18:17.948
Come on.

18:18.865 --> 18:20.283
I'll be right back.

18:22.160 --> 18:23.620
All those people out there?

18:23.787 --> 18:25.205
Oxygen deprivation.

18:25.372 --> 18:27.708
It's just the beginning.
Why are you here?

18:27.874 --> 18:29.626
I messed up.
I can't get the part.

18:29.793 --> 18:32.254
- Nygel wants me to...
- You went to Nygel?

18:32.421 --> 18:33.422
Yeah.

18:33.588 --> 18:36.216
Kane's been trying to
get her for years.

18:36.383 --> 18:37.801
Did anybody see you?

18:38.427 --> 18:39.678
I don't know.

18:39.845 --> 18:41.513
No. Abby,
I'm trying to tell you.

18:41.680 --> 18:43.140
We can't launch today.

18:43.306 --> 18:44.975
Are you sure Nygel has the part?

18:45.142 --> 18:47.477
- She can get one, yeah.
- Okay. I'll take care of it.

18:48.437 --> 18:49.813
What are you gonna do?

18:52.149 --> 18:53.734
The less you know, the better.

19:00.949 --> 19:04.244
<i>Attention.
Ration station will close in 15 minutes.</i>

19:04.411 --> 19:05.579
Hello, Dr. Griffin.

19:06.246 --> 19:07.581
Nygel.

19:10.500 --> 19:13.336
Morphine.
What do you want for it?

19:13.837 --> 19:15.005
Pressure regulator.

19:16.173 --> 19:17.799
I underestimated Raven.

19:18.675 --> 19:21.344
How does a girl like that get
such a well-connected benefactor?

19:21.636 --> 19:23.346
You have three seconds to decide.

19:23.513 --> 19:25.182
Do we have a deal or not?

19:26.433 --> 19:28.727
<i>Attention.
The mess hall will be closed tomorrow</i>

19:28.852 --> 19:31.646
<i>from 1100 hours to 1200 hours.</i>

19:34.900 --> 19:37.027
It's gonna be night soon, Finn.
Where are we going?

19:38.862 --> 19:41.364
At least tell me you have a plan
and we're not just wandering

19:41.531 --> 19:42.949
aimlessly through the woods.

19:43.116 --> 19:44.451
I have a plan.

19:45.869 --> 19:47.579
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

19:49.414 --> 19:51.574
Just because we saved you
doesn't mean you're forgiven.

19:51.666 --> 19:52.918
Got it?

19:54.711 --> 19:56.046
Clarke.

19:56.922 --> 19:58.215
What?

19:58.965 --> 20:00.383
She's just a kid.

20:00.550 --> 20:04.262
She's a killer.
You killed someone, Charlotte.

20:04.429 --> 20:06.014
Ended his life.

20:06.181 --> 20:09.351
Did you stop to think about
that for even one second?

20:09.518 --> 20:10.519
Look at me!

20:10.685 --> 20:13.688
You can't just kill someone
to make yourself feel better.

20:20.445 --> 20:21.947
<i>Charlotte!</i>

20:22.405 --> 20:24.658
<i>Clarke and Finn can't save you.</i>

20:25.575 --> 20:26.785
We should run.

20:26.952 --> 20:28.537
Yeah, that's one way to go.

20:29.412 --> 20:30.789
I like my plan better.

20:35.710 --> 20:37.003
Get in.

20:37.796 --> 20:39.130
Get in. Get in.

21:06.950 --> 21:09.619
Finn, what is this place?

21:10.954 --> 21:14.374
For now, it's home.

21:28.179 --> 21:29.819
I can't believe
you kept this place quiet.

21:29.931 --> 21:31.057
Come on, Clarke.

21:31.224 --> 21:32.785
What would be the point
of telling anybody?

21:32.809 --> 21:34.120
Some of this stuff could be useful.

21:34.144 --> 21:35.478
Like what?
There's no weapons.

21:35.645 --> 21:37.245
All the food expired,
like, 90 years ago.

21:37.314 --> 21:39.482
Yeah, but we could repurpose.
Share with the group.

21:39.649 --> 21:41.651
You can share this with
the group if you'd like.

21:46.323 --> 21:47.699
Heh.

21:48.783 --> 21:50.160
What'd you find?

21:52.495 --> 21:53.914
Well...

21:56.041 --> 21:57.834
Looks like they never made it here.

21:59.210 --> 22:02.505
No. I figure the bombs
took them by surprise.

22:04.299 --> 22:08.011
All this preparation.
What a waste.

22:11.139 --> 22:14.684
I don't know.
Maybe they were lucky.

22:16.603 --> 22:19.439
They couldn't have lived more
than a few years down here,

22:19.606 --> 22:23.860
then when they ran out of food
or lost their minds,

22:24.027 --> 22:27.405
they would've opened the doors
and been dead within a few days.

22:28.990 --> 22:30.742
Back then, maybe sooner.

22:35.455 --> 22:36.831
Anyway.

22:40.001 --> 22:41.711
What are we gonna do about her?

22:44.381 --> 22:47.258
If I hadn't confronted Murphy,
none of this would have happened.

22:47.634 --> 22:49.195
How could you know
it'd go down like that?

22:49.219 --> 22:50.679
Bellamy knew.

22:52.889 --> 22:54.891
We think the Grounders
are a threat.

22:55.058 --> 22:56.977
Now we're killing each other.

23:00.355 --> 23:02.065
There have to be consequences.

23:02.941 --> 23:04.943
We can't just let them hang people.

23:06.277 --> 23:07.612
No.

23:08.780 --> 23:12.033
Hopefully, we figure it out before
Murphy kills us for helping her.

23:12.993 --> 23:14.995
He's not the forgive and forget type.

23:23.336 --> 23:25.171
- How did you...
- Don't worry about it.

23:25.714 --> 23:27.257
How fast can you install it?

23:27.424 --> 23:28.717
I don't know.
A few hours, maybe.

23:28.967 --> 23:30.885
We may not have that much time.

23:31.928 --> 23:33.304
I'm on it.

23:35.724 --> 23:38.893
Our ancestors built this
Ark to be our salvation,

23:39.060 --> 23:42.605
but it's also our test.

23:45.817 --> 23:49.404
But we endure because we have faith.

23:49.571 --> 23:53.533
Faith that one day,
generations from now,

23:53.783 --> 23:56.911
our people will return to the ground.

23:58.747 --> 23:59.873
Are you here to join us?

24:00.165 --> 24:03.626
He's here to see me, Vera.
Go on with your mumbo-jumbo.

24:11.342 --> 24:14.220
Your mother's inspired today, Marcus.

24:14.763 --> 24:16.723
I remember when you were
the tender of the tree.

24:16.890 --> 24:18.558
You were a cute kid.

24:18.808 --> 24:20.351
Let's begin the offering.

24:23.438 --> 24:25.638
Why did you bring me down here, Nygel?
What do you want?

24:25.899 --> 24:28.777
It's about what you want.
I have something for you.

24:29.027 --> 24:31.154
Unless is a signed confession,
I'm not interested.

24:31.321 --> 24:33.740
Not even if it involves
your friend Abby Griffin?

24:37.410 --> 24:38.411
What about Abby?

24:38.578 --> 24:39.764
She and a girl named Raven Reyes

24:39.788 --> 24:42.332
asked me to get them
a pressure regulator.

24:43.249 --> 24:45.668
As a lowly culinary tech,
I didn't feel I had a choice

24:45.835 --> 24:49.839
when one of your fellow councillors
asked me to help her break the law.

24:53.009 --> 24:56.179
And since when do you
give up your customers?

24:56.346 --> 24:59.015
I don't have customers, Marcus.

24:59.182 --> 25:02.185
I am a citizen of the Ark,
and I don't believe anyone

25:02.352 --> 25:03.686
should be above the law.

25:04.771 --> 25:06.022
Do you?

25:07.357 --> 25:09.275
You're a plague on this ship, Nygel.

25:11.694 --> 25:13.863
And even if what you said is true,

25:14.155 --> 25:16.282
it's your word against
a member of the council,

25:16.449 --> 25:18.209
and who do you think
the people will believe?

25:20.870 --> 25:24.207
You know, you should thank me.

25:25.708 --> 25:27.544
With Abby out the way,

25:27.710 --> 25:30.672
your agenda should sail
right through.

25:33.466 --> 25:34.986
I don't know what you're
talking about.

25:35.718 --> 25:38.054
You're almost as convincing
as your mother.

25:38.221 --> 25:41.057
As the Earth will one day
provide for us,

25:41.224 --> 25:42.976
so we provide for the Earth.

25:43.143 --> 25:45.019
Waste of water if you ask me.

25:46.396 --> 25:47.772
Not to them.

26:06.958 --> 26:09.460
Finn. Finn, wake up.

26:14.048 --> 26:15.383
She's gone.

26:31.357 --> 26:33.776
Shh! Shh.

26:39.324 --> 26:40.783
Charlotte!

26:41.284 --> 26:42.952
You can't hide forever.

26:43.661 --> 26:45.413
Don't worry.
We won't hurt you.

26:50.126 --> 26:51.169
Let me go!

26:51.336 --> 26:52.795
I'm trying...
Hey, hey.

26:52.962 --> 26:54.797
I'm trying to help you.

26:54.964 --> 26:57.842
I'm not your sister!
Just stop helping me!

26:58.760 --> 27:00.011
I'm over here!

27:00.178 --> 27:01.618
Are you trying to get us
both killed?

27:01.721 --> 27:04.349
Just go, okay?
I'm the one they want.

27:05.183 --> 27:08.311
Okay, Charlotte, listen to me.

27:08.478 --> 27:10.313
I won't leave you.

27:12.565 --> 27:14.317
Please, Bellamy.

27:19.489 --> 27:21.366
Murphy! I'm over here!

27:22.659 --> 27:24.994
Come on out, Charlotte!
Come on out.

27:36.673 --> 27:38.091
Someone else was here.

27:39.008 --> 27:41.636
<i>- No, no! Murphy!</i>
- Murphy has her.

27:50.853 --> 27:52.689
Abby, how about I pace

27:52.855 --> 27:55.108
in the operating room
next time you're working?

27:57.860 --> 28:00.029
<i>Abby, did you take
morphine from the clinic?</i>

28:02.407 --> 28:03.783
They inventoried already?

28:03.950 --> 28:06.619
<i>No. Kane was just here.
He's on his way to Mecha</i>

28:06.786 --> 28:08.246
<i>to arrest both of you right now.</i>

28:08.413 --> 28:10.123
You gave Nygel morphine?

28:10.290 --> 28:11.874
She turned me in.

28:13.334 --> 28:14.377
How much longer?

28:14.544 --> 28:15.670
Twenty minutes.

28:15.837 --> 28:17.422
They're gonna be here in five.

28:23.219 --> 28:25.596
No matter what happens,
you launch that pod.

28:25.763 --> 28:27.223
Do you understand?

28:28.016 --> 28:29.392
I'm not going without you.

28:30.184 --> 28:33.396
Only one of us needs
to get to the ground, Raven.

28:33.563 --> 28:36.733
The second you find those kids,
you radio back.

28:37.567 --> 28:39.694
Three hundred innocent people
will die if you don't.

28:44.157 --> 28:46.451
Abby, they'll float you.

28:49.120 --> 28:50.121
Heh.

28:52.623 --> 28:54.083
Then they'll float me.

29:15.271 --> 29:17.398
Tell Clarke I love her.

29:21.235 --> 29:21.986
Charlotte!

29:22.153 --> 29:23.404
Put me down!

29:24.655 --> 29:25.990
Charlotte!

29:28.743 --> 29:29.952
Damn it.

29:34.123 --> 29:35.375
Bellamy!

29:36.125 --> 29:37.794
You cannot fight all of us.
Give her up.

29:39.087 --> 29:42.298
Maybe not, but I guarantee
I'll take a few of you with me.

29:42.465 --> 29:43.925
Bellamy! Stop!

29:45.468 --> 29:46.969
This has gone too far.

29:48.721 --> 29:50.932
Just calm down.
We'll talk about this.

29:56.813 --> 29:58.981
I'm sick of listening to you talk.

29:59.148 --> 30:01.818
- Let her go.
- I will slit her throat.

30:01.984 --> 30:04.987
No, please.
Please don't hurt her.

30:05.154 --> 30:06.447
Don't hurt her?

30:07.824 --> 30:09.158
Okay, I'll make you a deal.

30:09.325 --> 30:11.202
You come with me right now,
I will let her go.

30:13.246 --> 30:14.664
Don't do it, Charlotte.

30:17.333 --> 30:18.459
Don't do it, Charlotte!

30:18.626 --> 30:20.795
No! No, I have to!

30:24.173 --> 30:26.426
Murphy, this is not happening.

30:26.592 --> 30:29.804
I can't let any of you
get hurt anymore.

30:29.971 --> 30:34.016
Not because of me.
Not after what I did.

30:37.353 --> 30:38.563
Charlotte!

30:38.729 --> 30:39.981
No!

30:40.440 --> 30:43.401
No, no! No, no!

30:54.996 --> 30:56.831
Oh...

31:01.335 --> 31:02.628
Bellamy.

31:06.757 --> 31:08.009
Bellamy.

31:10.970 --> 31:13.222
Bellamy, stop!
You'll kill him!

31:16.225 --> 31:19.979
Get off me!
He deserves to die.

31:20.188 --> 31:22.482
No! We don't decide
who lives and dies.

31:22.648 --> 31:24.066
Not down here.

31:27.528 --> 31:30.823
So help me God, if you say the people
have a right to decide...

31:30.990 --> 31:33.534
No, I was wrong before, okay?
You were right.

31:34.410 --> 31:37.288
Sometimes it's dangerous
to tell people the truth.

31:37.455 --> 31:40.958
But if we're gonna survive down here,
we can't just live by

31:41.125 --> 31:44.420
whatever the hell we want.
We need rules.

31:44.587 --> 31:47.507
And who makes those rules, huh?
You?

31:48.549 --> 31:50.927
For now, we make the rules.
Okay?

31:51.677 --> 31:54.597
What, then? We just take him back
and pretend like it never happened?

31:54.764 --> 31:56.057
No!

32:04.065 --> 32:05.358
We banish him.

32:12.990 --> 32:14.283
Get up.

32:14.784 --> 32:16.285
Bellamy! Stop!

32:18.913 --> 32:22.291
If I ever catch you near camp,
we'll be back here.

32:23.751 --> 32:25.127
Understand?

32:30.341 --> 32:34.303
As for the four of you,
you can come back and follow me,

32:34.470 --> 32:36.347
or go off with him to die.

32:37.515 --> 32:38.933
Your choice.

33:22.018 --> 33:23.519
Come on!

33:38.618 --> 33:39.869
No!

33:41.704 --> 33:42.955
Damn it!

33:45.708 --> 33:47.209
She gave us a bad part.

34:08.648 --> 34:12.525
I'm hoping there's a logical
explanation for all this.

34:13.444 --> 34:15.071
My daughter.

34:17.156 --> 34:20.159
I know. I'm sorry.

34:22.328 --> 34:23.996
We all knew it was a long shot.

34:27.041 --> 34:28.417
I still believe.

34:36.676 --> 34:38.594
What's the pressure regulator for, Abby?

34:43.766 --> 34:46.143
There's no bacteria, is there?

34:48.688 --> 34:52.233
Your infected mechanic,
Raven Reyes.

34:54.735 --> 34:56.152
What's she up to?

35:10.126 --> 35:14.046
Did you know that her boyfriend,
Finn Collins,

35:14.213 --> 35:15.548
was one of the hundred?

35:18.300 --> 35:22.138
Your obsession is now gonna
get her floated, too.

35:31.731 --> 35:35.985
If you don't tell me what you're up to,

35:36.152 --> 35:37.778
I won't be able to save her.

35:39.905 --> 35:41.699
You still don't understand.

35:44.618 --> 35:46.704
I'm trying to save all of us.

35:53.544 --> 35:54.879
Arrest her.

35:55.755 --> 35:57.506
Continue to search for Raven Reyes.

35:57.715 --> 35:58.966
Sir.

36:15.065 --> 36:16.358
What was that?

36:16.776 --> 36:19.403
Sir, a pod launched.

36:21.655 --> 36:25.493
Abby...
What have you done?

36:27.119 --> 36:28.954
We have to know the truth.

36:37.171 --> 36:39.381
That's why we've decided
to banish him from camp.

36:40.674 --> 36:42.301
Anybody got a problem with that?

36:59.568 --> 37:01.237
Will we be able to talk to them?

37:01.695 --> 37:03.906
No. More like Morse code.

37:07.409 --> 37:08.828
You want to do the honors?

37:14.959 --> 37:16.418
That port right there.

37:25.678 --> 37:27.137
Whew.

37:32.935 --> 37:34.603
Aah!

37:38.023 --> 37:39.567
Whoa.

37:45.155 --> 37:46.448
What the hell?

37:49.535 --> 37:50.953
What happened?

37:51.120 --> 37:52.538
It didn't work.

37:54.331 --> 37:56.292
I think we fried
all the wristbands.

38:18.480 --> 38:19.857
Sit there at your own risk.

38:20.190 --> 38:21.817
I think I might be cursed.

38:21.984 --> 38:23.903
Then call me a risk taker.

38:24.069 --> 38:25.821
And, Jasper, you're not cursed.

38:26.989 --> 38:28.198
I'm lucky then.

38:28.365 --> 38:30.326
No. Brave.

38:30.534 --> 38:32.453
Brave?

38:32.578 --> 38:33.829
For getting my face bashed in

38:33.996 --> 38:36.206
or for ruining any
chance to contact the Ark?

38:36.498 --> 38:41.045
No, for standing up to a bully
and trying to help everyone.

38:41.211 --> 38:44.465
Yeah. And failing. Both times.

38:44.632 --> 38:47.593
I didn't see anyone else step up.
Did you?

38:48.594 --> 38:50.071
And I don't care how things
turned out.

38:50.095 --> 38:51.639
You were brave to try.

38:52.264 --> 38:54.183
And bravery is always rewarded.

39:14.703 --> 39:15.996
Finn!

39:16.872 --> 39:18.707
Finn, stop it! Calm down!

39:18.874 --> 39:21.043
We're dead to them!
Don't you get that?

39:21.210 --> 39:22.211
No, there's still hope.

39:22.378 --> 39:23.629
Even you don't believe that.

39:23.796 --> 39:25.047
It's over, Clarke.

39:25.214 --> 39:27.466
They're gonna die up there,
and we're alone.

39:27.591 --> 39:31.011
We're not alone!
You're not alone.

39:31.887 --> 39:33.555
You're not alone.
