how it works, Mrs. Bundy.

Okay, Jim.

13:28.400 --> 13:31.534
Let's clear up
a few misconceptions.

13:31.534 --> 13:35.000
There are two things
Peggy Bundy doesn't do.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.734
Number one:

13:36.734 --> 13:40.968
Cook, clean, sew, vacuum,
iron, and parent.

13:42.801 --> 13:44.501
And number two:

your whole life, Peggy Bundy.

Mrs. Bundy,
you're a strong woman.

13:58.334 --> 14:00.501
But I'm the healthiest man
in Chicago.

14:00.501 --> 14:03.234
I can see this week
is gonna be a test of wills.

14:12.100 --> 14:13.667

14:18.534 --> 14:20.434

Peggy,
you look fabulous.

14:33.467 --> 14:35.567
That time with Jim
really paid off.

Do you feel
better?

14:36.567 --> 14:37.968
Oh,
I certainly do.

I stick with my program,

Oh, it's my
fault, Al.

Well, you've been
killing me

16:22.834 --> 16:24.667

seem to care.

16:24.667 --> 16:26.801

16:26.801 --> 16:29.767
You've been as good
as dead for years.

16:29.767 --> 16:31.534
But what about
our children?

16:31.534 --> 16:33.834
I mean, is our lifestyle
killing them?

16:33.834 --> 16:36.133
Do we care enough
about our kids?

16:36.133 --> 16:38.567
Are we concerned
enough, as parents?

16:38.567 --> 16:39.868
Where are the kids?

16:39.868 --> 16:41.601
How would I know?

16:43.434 --> 16:44.767

the wet and greasy?

for this family.

17:10.701 --> 17:12.800
Did Jim Jupiter die in vain?

17:12.800 --> 17:15.567
Well, Jim taught me
that enjoying your food

17:15.567 --> 17:17.334
only leads to death.

17:17.334 --> 17:19.601
And I will not be responsible
for the death

of this family.

eating right.

called upon to do so,
