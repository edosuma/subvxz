WEBVTT

00:16.117 --> 00:18.252
Hey, where'd you
disappear to last night?

00:18.319 --> 00:20.554
After the party, I tried to ride
some dude's Great Dane

00:20.621 --> 00:22.323
all the way
to the water tower and back.

00:22.390 --> 00:23.324
It didn't go well.

00:23.391 --> 00:24.558
Did you see that kooky chick

00:24.625 --> 00:25.926
that I was carrying around
on my shoulders?

00:25.993 --> 00:27.928
Yeah.

00:27.995 --> 00:29.097
I left with her.

00:29.163 --> 00:31.765
She convinced me
to get a tattoo.

00:31.832 --> 00:33.134
Oh, that is awesome.

00:33.201 --> 00:35.203
(chuckles)
I want one.

00:37.071 --> 00:38.372
Oh! Why does
he think

00:38.439 --> 00:39.907
that's so funny?

00:39.973 --> 00:42.376
All right, this
is our job!

00:42.443 --> 00:43.577
Jimmy, he's the boss, man.

00:43.644 --> 00:46.280
You think I like it when
he pushes me in the bushes

00:46.347 --> 00:47.815
when I'm taking
a leak? I don't.

00:47.881 --> 00:48.816
The thorns hurt
my wiener.

00:48.882 --> 00:50.118
But this is
the career path

00:50.184 --> 00:52.920
that we've chosen.

00:52.986 --> 00:55.489
* *

00:58.826 --> 01:00.928
Hey, where you going?

01:00.994 --> 01:02.330
I quit.

01:02.396 --> 01:03.231
Come on!

01:03.297 --> 01:05.566
You can't walk out mid-skim.

01:05.633 --> 01:08.602
You have any idea
how unprofessional that is?

01:19.547 --> 01:20.848
(grunts)

01:20.914 --> 01:22.015
(laughs)

01:22.082 --> 01:24.452
* *

01:28.389 --> 01:31.459
(horn honking insistently)

01:32.326 --> 01:34.628
Keep your skirt on.

01:34.695 --> 01:36.897
Hey, Mom.

01:36.964 --> 01:38.666
What are you doing home?

01:38.732 --> 01:40.668
I quit. There's
got to be more to life

01:40.734 --> 01:42.170
than cleaning the same pool
over and over.

01:42.236 --> 01:44.104
There isn't.

01:45.473 --> 01:48.642
What the devil are you
ladies in such a hurry for?

01:48.709 --> 01:51.579
You know we're going
to scrub toilets, right?

01:56.784 --> 02:00.188
Oh, you forgot your shirt
again, Great-Maw Maw.

02:00.254 --> 02:02.590
Neh...!

02:02.656 --> 02:04.725
* *

02:39.327 --> 02:41.362
(music playing in headphones)

02:52.139 --> 02:54.875
(rapid knocking)

02:56.610 --> 02:58.379
Your father's home.
Come eat.

03:00.214 --> 03:01.982
(dog barking in distance)

03:02.049 --> 03:03.551
Dad.

03:03.617 --> 03:04.985
Jimmy.

03:05.052 --> 03:06.387
Your cousin Mike

03:06.454 --> 03:08.589
and I could've
used you today.

03:08.656 --> 03:10.858
There was a dead bird
in the Wexler's pool filter.

03:10.924 --> 03:12.693
Well, maybe you shouldn't
have pissed off the guy

03:12.760 --> 03:14.127
who's not afraid to
touch a dead bird.

03:14.194 --> 03:15.763
Oh, we got it out.

03:15.829 --> 03:18.198
Used a stick and an
old candy bar wrapper.

03:18.266 --> 03:20.634
Took a few tries,
but we got it out.

03:20.701 --> 03:21.735
MOM:
So...

03:21.802 --> 03:23.371
how's your
philostrophical journey

03:23.437 --> 03:25.138
for the meaning
of life going?

03:25.205 --> 03:26.507
I'm working on it.

03:26.574 --> 03:28.276
Didn't exactly figure out
my purpose in life yet,

03:28.342 --> 03:31.211
but if I ever record
an album, I'm pretty
sure I've got my cover.

03:31.279 --> 03:32.413
How was work, Wilford?

03:32.480 --> 03:34.448
Did you sell
any encyclopedias today?

03:34.515 --> 03:37.184
Why does she always pick me
to be her dead husband?

03:37.251 --> 03:38.752
Maybe that's your purpose.

03:38.819 --> 03:40.421
Just play along--
memories are all

03:40.488 --> 03:41.722
your great-grandmother
has left.

03:43.257 --> 03:44.124
Whoa!

03:44.191 --> 03:45.192
Okay.

03:45.259 --> 03:46.059
Okay, okay.

03:46.126 --> 03:48.195
Okay.
Okay, Maw Maw.

03:48.262 --> 03:49.697
(coughing)

03:49.763 --> 03:52.300
Why don't you go see if
Lawrence Welk is on the TV,
Ooh.

03:52.366 --> 03:53.634
and I'll bring you
your treat.

03:53.701 --> 03:55.068
Ooh, good.
(whispers):
Okay.

03:55.135 --> 03:57.305
Really good.

03:58.672 --> 04:00.441
(groans)
Doggone it!

04:00.508 --> 04:02.710
We're out of
bubble gum ice cream.

04:08.181 --> 04:09.450
(laughs)

04:10.284 --> 04:11.785
Oh, man, that's not fair.

04:11.852 --> 04:15.489
I was washing Maw Maw
out of my mouth.

04:15.556 --> 04:17.858
(rock music playing)

04:19.793 --> 04:22.229
(brakes squeak)

04:22.296 --> 04:23.764
Help!

04:23.831 --> 04:25.699
Help!

04:25.766 --> 04:28.001
(panting)

04:28.068 --> 04:30.404
Drive! Drive, drive,
drive, drive, drive!

04:30.471 --> 04:31.972
(tires squeal)
Who is that guy?

04:33.541 --> 04:34.775
What's happening?

04:34.842 --> 04:36.009
Nice try, jerk!

04:36.076 --> 04:39.079
JIMMY:
What's going on? Hello?
Uh, what's...

04:39.146 --> 04:40.080
what's hap...

04:40.147 --> 04:41.915
(gasps)
Oh, my God!

04:41.982 --> 04:43.283
This is so crazy!

04:43.351 --> 04:44.952
You've just,
like, saved my life.

04:45.018 --> 04:45.986
Really? I... What?

04:46.053 --> 04:47.187
You totally just saved my life.

04:47.254 --> 04:48.922
Wow! (laughs)

04:48.989 --> 04:51.058
* *

04:51.124 --> 04:53.361
(brakes squeak)

04:54.328 --> 04:56.364
You're, like, a hero!

04:56.430 --> 04:58.031
And you're cute.

04:58.098 --> 04:59.299
Really?

04:59.367 --> 05:01.234
Yeah, you saved my life
and you're cute.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.103
Well, this is fantastic.

05:03.170 --> 05:05.373
* *

05:07.541 --> 05:09.176
(birds chirping)

05:09.242 --> 05:10.644
(thump)

05:13.781 --> 05:15.649
(dog barking in distance)

05:27.127 --> 05:28.729
(door creaks)

05:28.796 --> 05:30.398
Mahmoda...

05:30.464 --> 05:32.265
Ahmamamama.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.468
Mahmoda...

05:34.535 --> 05:36.303
Mahmahamana.
Hey, here's
the hero.

05:36.370 --> 05:37.971
(awkward chuckle)
That's me.

05:38.038 --> 05:39.807
MOM:
Pull up a chair,
sleepy head.

05:39.873 --> 05:41.909
Your new friend's been
explaining the news to us.

05:41.975 --> 05:43.043
She can even pronounce

05:43.110 --> 05:44.878
that nutty Iran guy's name.
Say it again.

05:44.945 --> 05:46.980
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
(laughs)

05:48.682 --> 05:51.084
Uh, Virginia, do you mind
if I use the bathroom?

05:51.151 --> 05:52.453
Last door on the left, hon.

05:52.520 --> 05:53.587
And if you're
doing big business,

05:53.654 --> 05:55.155
you got to flush twice.

05:55.222 --> 05:57.190
And don't be running the sink
during the second flush,

05:57.257 --> 05:59.159
or you're gonna have to give it
a third go-round.

05:59.226 --> 06:00.861
Okay, got it.

06:00.928 --> 06:02.796
Be right back.

06:10.203 --> 06:11.472
Say it again!

06:11.539 --> 06:13.407
Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad!

06:13.474 --> 06:15.208
I like her, Jimmy.

06:15.275 --> 06:16.810
She thought
I was your sister.

06:16.877 --> 06:19.680
You could be her sister, you
sweet little young thing.

06:19.747 --> 06:22.483
I told you getting pregnant
at 15 would pay off eventually.

06:22.550 --> 06:23.751
JIMMY:
Yeah.

06:23.817 --> 06:25.085
She's pretty great, right?
Here I was,

06:25.152 --> 06:27.054
trying to figure out
what life was all about,

06:27.120 --> 06:29.189
and I think
I've found it-- love.

06:29.256 --> 06:31.224
I think I might be in love.

06:31.291 --> 06:32.493
Anybody happen
to catch her name?

06:33.527 --> 06:35.863
Name's Lucy.

06:35.929 --> 06:37.598
NEWSMAN:
This morning police are
searching for this woman,

06:37.665 --> 06:40.468
Lucy Carlyle, AKA Joan Doyle,

06:40.534 --> 06:42.102
AKA Selma Rydesdale.

06:42.169 --> 06:45.606
Carlyle is wanted for murder
in multiple cases.

06:45.673 --> 06:47.240
She kills her boyfriends--
two so far.

06:47.307 --> 06:50.210
We've been trying to catch her,
but she keeps

06:50.277 --> 06:51.479
changing her name

06:51.545 --> 06:52.813
She's tricky.

06:52.880 --> 06:55.015
She tried to choke me
with a pair of shoelaces.

06:55.082 --> 06:57.250
She was screaming something
about how I forgot her birthday.

06:57.317 --> 06:58.686
I chased her for a few blocks,

06:58.752 --> 07:00.954
but then she jumped into a van
with some guy.

07:01.021 --> 07:02.222
Good luck, dude.

07:02.289 --> 07:03.524
Her birthday's May 12.

07:03.591 --> 07:05.258
I'd buy a card now.

07:05.325 --> 07:06.627
(toilet flushing)

07:06.694 --> 07:08.295
NEWSMAN:
Anyone with
information regarding

07:08.361 --> 07:09.597
the whereabouts of Lucy Carlyle

07:09.663 --> 07:11.965
should contact
police immediately.

07:12.032 --> 07:14.568
And remember,
she may look sweet,
(toilet flushing)

07:14.635 --> 07:18.005
but she is extremely dangerous.

07:18.071 --> 07:20.741
And in lighter news,
a small-time crook with

07:20.808 --> 07:22.643
a long list of wrongs
he was making amends for

07:22.710 --> 07:23.977
has finally finished,

07:24.044 --> 07:27.548
and you'll never guess
how it ended.

07:27.615 --> 07:29.883
(grunts and groans)

07:31.619 --> 07:33.053
Call the police.

07:39.627 --> 07:40.861
Your girlfriend's
pretty clever.

07:40.928 --> 07:43.196
For her last meal,
she asked for a McRib

07:43.263 --> 07:44.698
and a shamrock shake.

07:44.765 --> 07:46.800
That should buy her
a few months.

07:46.867 --> 07:49.837
Those two are almost
never available at
the same limited time.

07:49.903 --> 07:51.471
She's not my girlfriend.

07:52.706 --> 07:53.974
Hey, sweetie.

07:54.041 --> 07:55.075
Hey.

07:55.142 --> 07:55.709
Miss me?

07:55.776 --> 07:57.077
Um, yeah, yeah, sure.

07:57.144 --> 07:59.112
Is that what you needed
to talk about?

08:00.648 --> 08:02.349
What are you doing?

08:02.415 --> 08:03.951
She gets an hour a day
to exercise.

08:04.017 --> 08:04.952
An hour?

08:05.018 --> 08:06.654
You should check
with the warden.

08:06.720 --> 08:09.523
I get an hour and a half--
an hour for me,

08:09.590 --> 08:11.959
and a half hour for
me and Jimmy's baby.

08:13.393 --> 08:15.663
LUCY:
I don't expect
anything from you.

08:15.729 --> 08:18.532
I just thought you should
know you're gonna be a dad.

08:18.599 --> 08:20.233
And you know what
the best part is?

08:20.300 --> 08:22.536
I'm supposed to get the electric
chair in seven months.

08:22.603 --> 08:24.672
That was before they
knew I was pregnant.

08:24.738 --> 08:26.039
There's no way
they're gonna kill

08:26.106 --> 08:27.641
the mother of
a six-month-old baby.

08:27.708 --> 08:28.909
(exhales)

08:28.976 --> 08:31.845
* *

08:31.912 --> 08:32.713
(thump)

08:32.780 --> 08:35.849
(electrical crackling, zapping)

08:42.489 --> 08:43.423
* *

08:43.490 --> 08:45.693
(baby cooing)

08:45.759 --> 08:46.760
What's its name?

08:46.827 --> 08:48.395
She named it
Princess Beyoncé,

08:48.461 --> 08:50.197
but I think I
might change that.

08:50.263 --> 08:52.766
Don't you dare--
that name's badass.

08:53.934 --> 08:55.302
A baby?

08:55.368 --> 08:56.704
Good Lord!

08:56.770 --> 08:59.640
Well, you can safe-drop it
at the fire station.

08:59.707 --> 09:01.709
Only make sure you
hand it to someone.

09:01.775 --> 09:03.877
You can't just throw it
in the bin out front.

09:03.944 --> 09:05.679
I think that's for
canned goods and puppies.

09:05.746 --> 09:07.547
I'm not taking her
to the fire station.

09:07.615 --> 09:09.082
Yeah, we don't have time
for that-- we got

09:09.149 --> 09:10.584
a rave tonight
we got to get ready for.

09:10.651 --> 09:12.019
I can't go to a rave.

09:12.085 --> 09:13.787
You have to go--
you're my ride.

09:13.854 --> 09:15.989
If I take my bike,
my pants'll get all wrinkled,

09:16.056 --> 09:18.058
and then all this ironing
will be for naught.

09:18.125 --> 09:20.160
Look, guys,
I'm keeping this baby,

09:20.227 --> 09:21.795
and I'd appreciate
a little support.

09:21.862 --> 09:24.031
Get that dog off my couch!

09:24.097 --> 09:25.265
(baby coos)

09:25.332 --> 09:27.300
You can't keep it, Jimmy!

09:27.367 --> 09:30.938
A baby will dramastically
change your life.

09:31.004 --> 09:32.105
What are you
gonna feed it?

09:32.172 --> 09:33.807
Do you even have
clothes for it?

09:33.874 --> 09:35.575
I'll bet you don't
even know where to go

09:35.643 --> 09:38.011
to get reasonably
priced portraits.

09:39.713 --> 09:41.649
I'll figure all this stuff out--
I just got her,

09:41.715 --> 09:42.916
like, an hour ago.

09:42.983 --> 09:44.451
How'd you even get it home?

09:44.517 --> 09:45.986
You don't have a special seat.

09:46.053 --> 09:48.088
I put her in the beanbag
in the back of the van,

09:48.155 --> 09:49.056
and I drove real slow.

09:49.122 --> 09:50.490
Oh.

09:50.557 --> 09:52.092
Okay.
Jimmy,

09:52.159 --> 09:55.595
what if we took the baby with us
to the rave, okay? Check it out.

09:55.663 --> 09:57.965
We'll give her a giant
lollipop and tell everyone
she's a munchkin.

09:58.031 --> 09:59.800
No.
Oh, come on, man!

09:59.867 --> 10:02.135
She just got out of prison--
let her have some fun.

10:02.202 --> 10:03.704
Look, I'm gonna
get one of those

10:03.771 --> 10:04.972
special seats for her.

10:05.038 --> 10:06.373
I'm gonna get her
lots of baby things.

10:06.439 --> 10:08.508
With what money?
I'll trade
my stuff for it.

10:08.575 --> 10:10.577
The pawnshop's full
of baby junk-- and my old crib

10:10.644 --> 10:11.879
is in the garage.

10:11.945 --> 10:13.513
Just keep an eye on her
till I get back.

10:13.580 --> 10:14.882
You're not leaving
that baby here.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.917
I have to.
I'm not driving with her again

10:16.984 --> 10:18.185
until I get
the special seat.

10:18.251 --> 10:19.152
Even driving slow,

10:19.219 --> 10:21.321
that beanbag slid around
a lot on turns.

10:21.388 --> 10:24.257
MOM:
We're not helping you
with this, Jimmy!

10:24.324 --> 10:26.593
That's the only way you're gonna
realize it's a stupid idea

10:26.660 --> 10:28.361
and go drop it
at the fire station.

10:28.428 --> 10:31.131
Wanna go see
the fire trucks, pumpkin?

10:31.198 --> 10:33.100
Hmm?

10:33.166 --> 10:36.704
* *

10:51.484 --> 10:53.687
Hey, is that one of our carts?

10:53.754 --> 10:55.889
Oh. No, i-it's my family's cart.

10:55.956 --> 10:58.258
Uh, it's been our backyard
since I was three.

10:58.325 --> 11:00.227
Yeah, right, come on,
just give it back.

11:00.293 --> 11:02.462
I'm not lying, all right?
It's ours.

11:02.529 --> 11:05.198
Uh, when it's nice out,
we put it over a fire
and use it as a grill.

11:05.265 --> 11:06.099
See? Look.

11:06.166 --> 11:07.735
There's a little cheese left.

11:07.801 --> 11:09.169
(baby crying)

11:10.403 --> 11:12.439
Why is there a baby in there?
Oh, uh,

11:12.505 --> 11:15.042
I don't have a regular
baby pusher thing yet.

11:15.108 --> 11:17.811
So, we're headed to
the pawnshop right now.

11:17.878 --> 11:20.313
Sir... whose baby is that?

11:20.380 --> 11:22.115
Mine. Uh, her name
is Princess Beyoncé,

11:22.182 --> 11:23.350
but I'm thinking
of changing that.

11:23.416 --> 11:25.953
(crying)
Oh. Heh.

11:26.019 --> 11:28.789
See, I don't
have a bottle yet.

11:28.856 --> 11:30.423
I just got her a few hours ago.

11:30.490 --> 11:31.792
MAN:
Sabrina!

11:31.859 --> 11:33.026
What the dog doo!

11:33.093 --> 11:34.461
Break's over!
I need you!

11:34.527 --> 11:36.897
Somebody took all
the soup cans off the shelf

11:36.964 --> 11:39.432
and put 'em back
upside down again!

11:39.499 --> 11:42.602
Who would put all the
soup cans upside down?

11:42.669 --> 11:44.204
Oh, me.

11:44.271 --> 11:46.606
Why?
I don't know, I work
at a grocery story--

11:46.673 --> 11:48.776
I get bored.

11:48.842 --> 11:50.243
Sabrina!

11:52.345 --> 11:54.147
Okay, just...

11:54.214 --> 11:56.483
promise me that
that's your baby.

11:56.549 --> 11:57.918
Oh, I promise.

12:02.589 --> 12:04.992
(crying)

12:05.058 --> 12:07.527
(door creaks open)

12:07.594 --> 12:09.529
Just calm down, Maw Maw.

12:09.596 --> 12:11.398
It's not as bad
as you think.

12:11.464 --> 12:12.499
What's going on?

12:12.565 --> 12:13.600
She's lucid.

12:13.666 --> 12:14.567
It's been almost five minutes.

12:14.634 --> 12:16.503
Whoa, that is a long one.

12:16.569 --> 12:18.438
So, you're telling me

12:18.505 --> 12:22.209
that I just let all of you live
in my house free?

12:22.275 --> 12:23.376
Unbelievable.

12:23.443 --> 12:24.611
It's Jimmy.

12:24.677 --> 12:26.346
Hello.

12:26.413 --> 12:27.815
Who the hell are you?

12:27.881 --> 12:28.949
I'm Mike, Jimmy's cousin.

12:29.016 --> 12:30.283
You and I are related by

12:30.350 --> 12:31.484
divorce or something.

12:31.551 --> 12:32.953
I live in a tent
in your laundry room.

12:33.020 --> 12:34.421
No, not anymore you don't.

12:34.487 --> 12:35.655
You guys, pack up

12:35.722 --> 12:36.924
all your gypsy circus

12:36.990 --> 12:38.591
and find another teat
to suck on.

12:38.658 --> 12:40.393
(sighs)
You're kidding me.

12:40.460 --> 12:44.231
The shopping cart got stolen
when he was in the pawn shop.

12:44.297 --> 12:45.966
Oh, man!

12:46.033 --> 12:48.768
I was gonna grill
burgers this weekend.

12:48.836 --> 12:51.204
This baby's messing
up everything.

12:51.271 --> 12:52.906
Well, I can't just leave.

12:52.973 --> 12:54.641
We've got a situation here.

12:54.707 --> 12:55.708
Your great-grandmother's...

12:55.775 --> 12:57.110
Is that Wilfred?

12:57.177 --> 13:00.113
Tell him to stop by the
butcher shop on the way home,

13:00.180 --> 13:02.282
because the Greensteens are
coming over for dinner tonight,

13:02.349 --> 13:04.885
and all I've got in the
ice box is pork chops.

13:04.952 --> 13:05.919
(laughs)
Oh.

13:05.986 --> 13:07.287
Never mind. We're good.

13:08.621 --> 13:11.024
I knew I was gonna
get snookered into this.

13:11.091 --> 13:14.527
I do not have time for
a baby in my life, Jimmy.

13:14.594 --> 13:16.329
It's one time.
I won't bother you again.

13:16.396 --> 13:19.099
Now that I have the car seat,
it's safe to have her in my van.

13:19.166 --> 13:20.733
Your van doesn't
have a backseat.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.102
Where are you
gonna strap it in?

13:22.169 --> 13:24.237
What do you mean,
strap it in?

13:24.304 --> 13:26.539
(tires squealing,
baby crying)

13:26.606 --> 13:27.640
She's fine.
She's fine.

13:27.707 --> 13:28.942
She's totally fine.

13:29.009 --> 13:30.978
Can't believe you
didn't strap it in.

13:31.044 --> 13:32.880
I just thought you had to strap
the baby to the seat,

13:32.946 --> 13:34.147
not the seat to the car.

13:34.214 --> 13:35.415
Look, I don't know
how this stuff works.

13:35.482 --> 13:37.217
You know how gravity
works, don't you?

13:37.284 --> 13:38.718
Don't try and act so smart.

13:38.785 --> 13:39.920
The only reason you
knew to strap it in

13:39.987 --> 13:40.921
is 'cause you
already had a baby.

13:40.988 --> 13:42.155
That's not true.

13:42.222 --> 13:43.957
We didn't have those
kind of safety things

13:44.024 --> 13:45.425
when you were a baby.

13:45.492 --> 13:46.626
What are you talking about?

13:46.693 --> 13:48.161
They had car seats
20 years ago.

13:48.228 --> 13:49.762
I didn't say, they
didn't have them.

13:49.829 --> 13:51.364
I said, we
didn't have them.

13:59.072 --> 14:01.674
Mm. Virginia, squirrel.

14:01.741 --> 14:03.676
(tires squealing)

14:03.743 --> 14:07.480
Jimmy, be careful you
don't fall in the hole.

14:15.788 --> 14:18.258
I can't believe I'm still alive.

14:18.325 --> 14:20.127
Well, you are. If
you want that baby

14:20.193 --> 14:21.594
to stay alive,
you'll listen to me

14:21.661 --> 14:22.795
and take it to the fire station.

14:22.862 --> 14:25.432
I'm not safe dropping my baby.

14:25.498 --> 14:27.434
You don't know
what you're doing.

14:27.500 --> 14:30.003
I'm learning, and the more
I read, the more I realize

14:30.070 --> 14:31.671
all the stuff
you did wrong. E.I.

14:31.738 --> 14:34.174
You're not supposed
to smoke in front of babies.

14:34.241 --> 14:36.944
That's only when you're
pregnant, stupid.

14:37.010 --> 14:38.345
Anyway, I don't
believe that.

14:38.411 --> 14:40.147
I smoked with you,
and you're fine.

14:40.213 --> 14:43.516
Fine? I had asthma
the first 17 years
of my life.

14:43.583 --> 14:46.286
I've got seven permanent teeth
that still haven't come in.

14:46.353 --> 14:47.921
And I'm allergic to fruit.

14:47.988 --> 14:51.158
Fruit.

14:52.059 --> 14:55.195
Fine. We'll walk home.

14:55.262 --> 14:58.131
Book says
fresh air is great for her.

15:02.135 --> 15:04.237
(easy listening music plays,
register beeping)

15:04.304 --> 15:07.174
(cooing)

15:07.240 --> 15:08.675
Hmm.

15:08.741 --> 15:09.909
Oh, hey, it's you.

15:09.977 --> 15:11.811
Weird guy.

15:11.878 --> 15:12.946
Nice car seat.

15:13.013 --> 15:14.481
Oh, yeah, thanks.

15:14.547 --> 15:16.116
It's a used one.

15:16.183 --> 15:17.284
I can see that.

15:17.350 --> 15:19.186
Who used it, Baby Jesus?

15:19.252 --> 15:20.253
(cooing)

15:20.320 --> 15:22.055
Yeah. It's an earlier model.

15:22.122 --> 15:25.425
Listen, uh, I have a question
about this food.

15:25.492 --> 15:26.960
Uh, it might be
a stupid question,

15:27.027 --> 15:28.895
but I feel I should ask.

15:28.962 --> 15:30.730
I'm sure it's not stupid.

15:30.797 --> 15:33.000
Okay. Well, um,
the book I have says

15:33.066 --> 15:34.434
I should feed her vegetables,

15:34.501 --> 15:36.769
and I want to do that,
but the only

15:36.836 --> 15:38.838
vegetable jars I found
have pictures of either

15:38.905 --> 15:41.608
black babies or Asian babies
on them, and I don't know

15:41.674 --> 15:43.476
if the pictures are random,
you know,

15:43.543 --> 15:45.645
or if there is a reason
Asian babies

15:45.712 --> 15:48.681
instead of white ones should eat
these particular string beans.

15:48.748 --> 15:51.651
That is a really good question.

15:51.718 --> 15:54.221
The color of the babies on
the jars doesn't matter.

15:54.287 --> 15:55.388
However, it's really important

15:55.455 --> 15:56.956
that you do not
feed her anything

15:57.024 --> 16:00.427
with a picture of a boy on it,
or else she will grow a penis.

16:01.894 --> 16:04.464
And a mustache.

16:04.531 --> 16:05.532
(baby cooing)

16:05.598 --> 16:07.967
I said, it might be
a stupid question.

16:08.035 --> 16:10.403
Yeah, you did.
I just...

16:10.470 --> 16:12.272
wasn't really
prepared for that.

16:12.339 --> 16:15.608
Well, the produce
doodler is back.

16:27.520 --> 16:29.456
(sniffing)

16:31.724 --> 16:33.660
(sniffing)

16:33.726 --> 16:35.062
(baby cooing)

16:35.128 --> 16:37.097
(sniffing)

16:39.366 --> 16:41.268
(sniffs)
Oh.

16:41.334 --> 16:42.935
(talking
baby talk)
Ugh!

16:43.002 --> 16:45.672
Your baby stinks.

16:45.738 --> 16:46.806
(sniffs)

16:46.873 --> 16:48.341
Oh, wow.

16:48.408 --> 16:51.078
All right, I'll change her.

16:51.144 --> 16:53.846
Knew I'd have to do
this sooner or later.

16:53.913 --> 16:56.383
No big deal.

16:56.449 --> 16:58.051
Gin.

16:58.118 --> 16:59.419
Pick up your cards, Maw Maw.

16:59.486 --> 17:01.521
We're playing Crazy Eights.

17:03.456 --> 17:04.824
Okay.

17:04.891 --> 17:07.994
Looks like we'll just use
this sticky tape on the sides.

17:08.061 --> 17:11.398
Shouldn't be too hard.

17:11.464 --> 17:13.233
(gags)

17:14.033 --> 17:15.502
I need paper towels!

17:15.568 --> 17:17.036
I need paper towels!
I need paper towels!

17:17.104 --> 17:17.937
What happened?

17:18.004 --> 17:20.107
I threw up on the baby.

17:23.110 --> 17:24.877
You have got to
be kidding me.

17:24.944 --> 17:26.113
How in the world...?

17:31.151 --> 17:33.186
(baby cooing)

17:33.253 --> 17:34.487
All clean.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.523
And she really liked
the bath, too.

17:36.589 --> 17:38.625
I think that's gonna be
a weekly thing.

17:38.691 --> 17:41.094
And since lights out
at the prison was 7:30,

17:41.161 --> 17:42.929
I think it's time
for Grandma and Grandpa

17:42.995 --> 17:45.532
to come give Princess Beyoncé
a kiss good night.

17:48.135 --> 17:50.303
Okay, then.

17:50.370 --> 17:52.004
I'll be back
in five minutes.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.873
Deal me in
next hand.

17:53.940 --> 17:55.842
(baby crying)

17:59.646 --> 18:01.881
Jimmy, it has
been six hours.

18:01.948 --> 18:03.316
People are
trying to sleep.

18:03.383 --> 18:05.952
You've got to get that
baby to shut up now!

18:06.018 --> 18:07.520
Already? Please, Mom.

18:07.587 --> 18:09.722
Let me play with her
for five more minutes.

18:09.789 --> 18:11.891
Please?!

18:11.958 --> 18:13.826
(crying continues)

18:19.666 --> 18:21.368
Jimmy?

18:21.434 --> 18:24.003
Do I need to remind you that
we both have to work tomorrow?!

18:24.070 --> 18:27.274
Maybe you can sleepwalk your way
through skimming leaves, but

18:27.340 --> 18:28.508
I got to be fresh.

18:28.575 --> 18:29.942
I've got pHs to balance.

18:30.009 --> 18:31.611
That's science.

18:31.678 --> 18:33.446
Get it to sleep.

18:33.513 --> 18:35.215
I'm doing the best I can, Dad.

18:53.600 --> 18:55.702
Mmm. Jimmy, you missed
a hell of a party.

18:55.768 --> 18:56.869
(laughter)

19:00.307 --> 19:01.774
Yeah!
Woo!

19:01.841 --> 19:03.310
(baby crying)

19:03.376 --> 19:05.712
Okay, I don't know
what you want.

19:05.778 --> 19:07.380
We walked, you cried.

19:07.447 --> 19:09.182
We rocked, you cried.
We ate,

19:09.249 --> 19:10.450
you cried.
We drank, you cried.

19:10.517 --> 19:12.051
Maybe you just want to cry,
is that it?

19:12.118 --> 19:13.486
Would you like me
to cry with you?

19:13.553 --> 19:15.355
'Cause I feel like crying.

19:17.457 --> 19:19.626
Hey, what-what are you doing?

19:19.692 --> 19:20.960
I got this.

19:21.027 --> 19:23.029
(crying)

19:23.095 --> 19:24.931
(guitar plays gentle melody)

19:27.600 --> 19:31.571
* People smile and tell me
I'm the lucky one... *

19:31.638 --> 19:33.973
(whispers):
This used to work with you.

19:34.040 --> 19:36.776
* We've just begun *

19:36.843 --> 19:39.446
* Think I'm gonna have
a son... *

19:39.512 --> 19:40.913
(whispers):
Dim the lights.

19:40.980 --> 19:48.054
* He will be like he and me
as free as a dove *

19:48.120 --> 19:49.456
* Conceived in love *

19:49.522 --> 19:54.961
* Sun is gonna shine above *

19:55.027 --> 19:59.632
* Even though
we ain't got money *

19:59.699 --> 20:01.901
* I'm so in love
with you, honey *

20:01.968 --> 20:07.907
* Everything will bring
a chain of love *

20:07.974 --> 20:11.411
* And in the morning
when I rise *

20:11.478 --> 20:14.314
* Bring a tear of joy
to my eyes *

20:14.381 --> 20:16.449
* And tell me *

20:16.516 --> 20:21.621
* Everything is gonna be
all right *

20:21.688 --> 20:23.590
(humming)

20:29.462 --> 20:31.498
(humming continues)

20:43.943 --> 20:45.745
(door creaks open)

20:47.146 --> 20:48.981
She's asleep.

20:50.583 --> 20:51.751
Thanks.

20:51.818 --> 20:53.986
(sighs)

20:54.053 --> 20:56.589
Are you ready to admit
you're not cut out for this?

20:56.656 --> 20:58.458
It was the first day.

20:58.525 --> 21:01.093
I'm not dropping her at the
fire station after one day.

21:01.160 --> 21:02.829
And what makes you so sure

21:02.895 --> 21:04.997
someone else can do
better than me anyway?

21:05.064 --> 21:08.401
Jimmy, you almost killed it,
and we both threw up on it.

21:08.468 --> 21:10.337
I can't do this
without you guys.

21:10.403 --> 21:11.904
It's not that

21:11.971 --> 21:13.773
we don't want
to help you, Jimmy.

21:13.840 --> 21:14.907
We can't.

21:14.974 --> 21:16.343
We don't know what
we're doing, either.

21:16.409 --> 21:17.577
Well, it sure looked like

21:17.644 --> 21:19.011
you knew what you
were doing in there.

21:19.078 --> 21:20.079
We sang a song.

21:20.146 --> 21:22.114
Anybody can sing a song.

21:22.181 --> 21:24.351
Charles Manson
can sing a song.

21:24.417 --> 21:26.018
He's actually
pretty darn good.

21:26.085 --> 21:27.053
Mike has his album.

21:27.119 --> 21:28.488
He is good,

21:28.555 --> 21:29.656
but that doesn't mean

21:29.722 --> 21:33.225
you want him helping you
raise your child.

21:33.292 --> 21:35.528
Jimmy, what is it with you
and this baby?

21:35.595 --> 21:37.897
Are you afraid people are going
to look at you differently

21:37.964 --> 21:40.066
if you give it away? No one's
gonna look at you differently.

21:40.132 --> 21:41.968
That's the problem, Mom.

21:42.034 --> 21:44.804
I want people to look
at me differently.

21:44.871 --> 21:47.407
All right, I'm sick of
people looking at me

21:47.474 --> 21:48.775
like I don't have a purpose.

21:48.841 --> 21:52.379
I want people to look at me
the way that baby looks at me.

21:52.445 --> 21:53.946
Like I'm someone special.

21:54.013 --> 21:56.883
This is a chance for me
to do something good.

21:56.949 --> 22:00.387
It's a chance for all of
us to do something good.

22:04.391 --> 22:07.527
I always did think I could
have done better with a girl.

22:09.295 --> 22:11.130
They do say,
you learn by your mistakes.

22:11.197 --> 22:13.566
We've already made
every mistake there is.

22:16.002 --> 22:17.704
What are we gonna name it?

22:17.770 --> 22:20.139
I'm not parading
my granddaughter around church

22:20.206 --> 22:22.609
with a name
like Princess Beyoncé.

22:22.675 --> 22:25.077
I don't know.

22:25.144 --> 22:26.513
What do you think?

22:30.016 --> 22:32.051
I always kind of liked...

22:32.118 --> 22:34.286
Hope.

22:34.353 --> 22:35.955
Then Hope it is.

22:41.894 --> 22:44.597
Hey, I talked to a cute girl
at the grocery store yesterday.

22:44.664 --> 22:46.165
Has she killed anyone?

22:46.232 --> 22:48.234
Nah, I don't think so.

22:48.300 --> 22:50.036
You know, you need
to grow a pair

22:50.102 --> 22:51.471
and take a serious run at that.

22:51.538 --> 22:53.072
Could use another
set of hands

22:53.139 --> 22:56.008
around here to help us
keep that... baby alive.

22:56.075 --> 22:58.645
No. I think
she thinks I'm weird.

22:58.711 --> 23:00.447
Well, just think
how happy she'll be

23:00.513 --> 23:02.014
when she finds out
you're normal.

23:03.416 --> 23:05.452
* *

23:08.988 --> 23:10.723
I got her.

23:13.125 --> 23:17.063
(baby crying)

23:17.129 --> 23:19.466
Give her a second.
