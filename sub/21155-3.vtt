WEBVTT

00:01.502 --> 00:02.582
Previously, on "Killjoys"...

00:03.087 --> 00:06.124
437 local agents

00:06.132 --> 00:07.497
have stopped reporting for duty.

00:07.508 --> 00:10.341
Until we know why,
my investigators and |

00:10.344 --> 00:12.426
are resuming full control
of this RAC

00:12.430 --> 00:14.261
effective immediately.

00:14.265 --> 00:17.428
-Aneela, I am sorry to say,
is quite a bit insane.

00:17.435 --> 00:18.595
- Yeah, no shit.

00:18.603 --> 00:19.968
- The green breaks your bonds

00:19.979 --> 00:21.219
with anyone you've ever loved.

00:21.230 --> 00:22.265
Khlyen is different.

00:22.273 --> 00:23.513
He feels for you.

00:23.524 --> 00:25.435
No!

00:25.443 --> 00:26.649
- I'm sorry, Yala.

00:26.652 --> 00:28.984
- Holy shit, you're cured?

00:31.282 --> 00:33.443
- The thing we're fighting...
It's organic.

00:33.451 --> 00:34.987
We're never gonna beat it
until we understand

00:34.994 --> 00:37.986
its biology, so I need you.

00:44.795 --> 00:46.456
- Dutch, it's me.

00:46.464 --> 00:48.671
- You're back.

00:51.594 --> 00:54.677
- It was like a nightmare
that never ended.

00:54.680 --> 00:57.467
I'm not even sure
if I can describe it.

00:57.475 --> 00:59.386
- If you're looking
to be reinstated

00:59.393 --> 01:03.511
after your little sabbatical,
you better try.

01:06.484 --> 01:08.395
- Okay.

01:10.446 --> 01:13.358
Well, not to brag or anything,
but it involves saving people,

01:13.366 --> 01:15.652
lots of people...

01:15.660 --> 01:16.740
from pirates.

01:16.744 --> 01:18.826
- Save the bullshit for Turin.

01:18.829 --> 01:21.821
All I wanna know is why you
and 400 other RAC agents

01:21.832 --> 01:23.788
disappeared three months ago.
- l have nothing

01:23.793 --> 01:25.704
to do with that...
I left on a personal matter.

01:25.711 --> 01:28.748
- That would be death of rebel
Qreshi leader lllenore Seyah.

01:28.756 --> 01:32.499
- Pawter.
Her name was Pawter.

01:32.510 --> 01:34.592
And she didn't die.
She was murdered.

01:37.473 --> 01:38.713
Words matter.

01:38.724 --> 01:41.807
- Here's a pretty word:
Vengeance.

01:41.811 --> 01:43.847
They never did catch
that rogue Scarback

01:43.854 --> 01:45.640
who allegedly killed her,
did they?

01:45.648 --> 01:47.684
- No idea... I've been away.
- I can help.

01:47.692 --> 01:50.434
Make that a RAC priority.

01:50.444 --> 01:52.355
Just tell me
what Dutch has to do

01:52.363 --> 01:54.024
with the missing agents

01:54.031 --> 01:56.898
so that I can protect her
from the fallout.

01:56.909 --> 01:59.070
- Mm.

01:59.078 --> 02:01.410
- Is that a yes?

02:01.414 --> 02:03.029
We're all in this
together, Jaqobis.

02:03.040 --> 02:05.622
- How about this...
Your entire job is bringing back

02:05.626 --> 02:07.457
missing agents, right?

02:07.461 --> 02:08.871
Well, good luck with that
if word gets out

02:08.879 --> 02:12.087
that you turned on the first one
who came back.

02:12.091 --> 02:16.425
Why make me your problem
when I can be your poster boy?

02:16.429 --> 02:18.385
We're all in this
together, right?

02:20.683 --> 02:23.550
-And I thought you were
just the funny one.

02:23.561 --> 02:25.301
- | multitask.

02:28.733 --> 02:31.349
- Johnny Jaqobis,
you are hereby reinstated

02:31.360 --> 02:32.896
as a Reclamation
and Apprehension Agent

02:32.903 --> 02:35.565
in good standing.

02:35.573 --> 02:38.064
You know Killjoys
are 100% mod-free,

02:38.075 --> 02:39.656
so lose the finger banger.

02:39.660 --> 02:43.653
- Oh, you... you mean
this one?

02:43.664 --> 02:46.497
See? Multitasking.

02:51.839 --> 02:54.125
I swear Benny told the RAC
doctor to make it hurt.

02:54.133 --> 02:55.919
Next time, I'm going
to a Company doc on Westerley.

02:55.926 --> 02:57.837
- Yeah, good luck finding one.

02:57.845 --> 02:59.927
Company's mostly pulled up
stakes since the wall came down.

02:59.930 --> 03:01.841
- Westerley, the RAC...
| go away for a bit,

03:01.849 --> 03:03.840
and everything's changed.
- I can't believe she asked you

03:03.851 --> 03:05.762
to snitch on Dutch though.
- Oh, I can.

03:05.770 --> 03:08.762
Bitches gonna bitch.
- So the brass hates us.

03:08.773 --> 03:10.479
Dutch hates everyone else...

03:10.483 --> 03:11.848
It's three against the Universe.

03:11.859 --> 03:14.441
And things haven't
changed that much...

03:14.445 --> 03:17.858
-Agent 9386, missing.
- Then again...

03:17.865 --> 03:19.776
- Fancy calls them "cleansed."

03:19.784 --> 03:22.867
-Almost sounds nice.

03:22.870 --> 03:24.735
You know what we need?

03:24.747 --> 03:27.489
A good, old-fashioned,
balls-out Warrant adventure.

03:27.500 --> 03:29.456
Kick the dust off the booties,
nothing weird,

03:29.460 --> 03:32.418
nothing mysterious, just...

03:33.589 --> 03:34.874
- Or...

03:35.800 --> 03:37.756
So these just showed up
out of nowhere?

03:37.760 --> 03:39.466
- They've cloaked
on Arkyn for decades.

03:39.470 --> 03:40.755
- So why did they bring
this one to Leith?

03:40.763 --> 03:42.879
- Good question.
Let's check with Zeph.

03:42.890 --> 03:46.178
- Uh, what's a Zeph?
- That's a Zeph.

03:46.185 --> 03:48.471
Say hello.

03:48.479 --> 03:49.764
Zeph!

03:51.774 --> 03:54.481
New nerd, meet old nerd.

03:54.485 --> 03:56.441
- It's Johnny,
and don't be nervous.

03:56.445 --> 03:58.822
I'm sure half of what they said
about me is wildly exaggerated.

03:58.823 --> 04:00.905
- Sure, okay.

04:00.908 --> 04:02.773
lt moved.
- I'm sorry, what?

04:02.785 --> 04:04.650
- The ship... this ship.

04:04.662 --> 04:05.902
Turin brought it here
for me to study.

04:05.913 --> 04:07.528
It moved... and recently.

04:07.540 --> 04:09.201
- We can't even open the door.

04:09.208 --> 04:10.869
How do you know it moved?
- Thank you for asking.

04:10.876 --> 04:12.787
The residual radiation readings
from the hull

04:12.795 --> 04:14.660
are off the charts,
and it's not local rad either,

04:14.672 --> 04:16.208
though probably still in the J.

04:16.215 --> 04:18.797
I'd say it moved
in the last... 72 hours.

04:18.801 --> 04:20.666
- Whoa, easy there,
Captain Specific.

04:20.678 --> 04:23.010
Radiation's half-life would make
that an impossible call.

04:23.013 --> 04:25.720
- Not if you can do the math.

04:27.518 --> 04:28.849
Well, I think
I'm pretty good at math.

04:28.853 --> 04:30.514
- Well, if you were,
I don't see how

04:30.521 --> 04:31.852
you could ask that question.

04:33.566 --> 04:34.681
- Can I talk to you
for a second?

04:34.692 --> 04:35.898
- Mm-hmm.

04:37.862 --> 04:40.899
- I'm sure your math
is very math-y.

04:44.827 --> 04:46.567
- Look, I know what
you're gonna say,

04:46.579 --> 04:48.570
but we're trying to build
an army here, Johnny,

04:48.581 --> 04:50.788
and I didn't know
when you were coming back.

04:52.626 --> 04:54.617
awkward turtle over there.

04:54.628 --> 04:57.836
- We need all the help
that we can get.

04:57.840 --> 04:59.796
We still have no idea
what this fleet is for

04:59.800 --> 05:03.634
or where the pilots
or how to even open it.

05:03.637 --> 05:06.595
You're back now, and we can
figure it out like we always do.

05:06.599 --> 05:08.555
Just more of us.

05:10.895 --> 05:14.604
Come on, she's rough.
So are you.

05:14.607 --> 05:16.893
Put your mental pants on.
- | feel fat in them.

05:16.901 --> 05:19.938
Look, Dutch, I came back

05:19.945 --> 05:22.857
to team, not to teach.
So if she wants to stay,

05:22.865 --> 05:25.277
it'll take some big moves
to impress me.

05:25.284 --> 05:27.024
- Whoa, what'd you do?

05:27.036 --> 05:29.869
I guess I opened it.

05:29.872 --> 05:31.828
- Yay.

05:43.969 --> 05:46.301
- Clear?
- Clear.

05:52.895 --> 05:54.726
- I've never seen
anything like this.

05:54.730 --> 05:57.563
- l have for the last
three months.

05:57.566 --> 05:59.648
Different model, but the same
engine controls.

05:59.652 --> 06:01.984
Grav generator, um...

06:01.987 --> 06:05.275
weird squiggly thing.

06:05.282 --> 06:08.774
Interesting fact: The design is
based on standard transistors

06:08.786 --> 06:10.868
and energy flow that
we're used to in engineering.

06:10.871 --> 06:13.829
If anything, it's more...
- Organic.

06:13.833 --> 06:15.915
- l was gonna say complex.
- Organic systems are always

06:15.918 --> 06:17.704
more complex.

06:17.711 --> 06:19.793
Nature can run rings
around any wrench monkey.

06:19.797 --> 06:22.630
-All right, all right, don't
get your slide rules in a knot.

06:22.633 --> 06:24.043
- Slide rules?
What are we, animals?

06:24.051 --> 06:26.713
- Right?
Try growing up with him.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.051
- What are these?

06:30.349 --> 06:32.931
- Flight logs,
last known coordinates,

06:32.935 --> 06:35.802
and, by the looks of it,
it wasn't a local trip.

06:35.813 --> 06:39.977
- So if we wanted to go to recon
wherever this ship just went...

06:39.984 --> 06:42.066
- Wait a minute...
We have no idea

06:42.069 --> 06:45.357
where this will send us.
- Risk nothing, get nothing.

06:45.364 --> 06:47.821
Look, these ships are weapons
in our own backyard.

06:47.825 --> 06:49.656
I need to know
who controls them.

06:49.660 --> 06:51.867
- Anybody want my opinion?

06:51.871 --> 06:54.829
- Sorry, Johnny, ljust
got out of the habit of...

06:54.832 --> 06:56.663
Go on, the floor's yours.
- Okay, all right, let's just

06:56.667 --> 06:58.328
start with some
basic questions, okay?

06:58.335 --> 06:59.871
Hey, what happened to my floor?

07:02.089 --> 07:03.829
- I skipped to the fun part.

07:03.841 --> 07:05.923
You know you wanted me to.

07:11.390 --> 07:16.305
- Well, you said you wanted
an adventure.

07:19.106 --> 07:21.768
- J‘ Ooh, ooh

07:21.775 --> 07:22.935
J“ Ooh, ooh

07:24.153 --> 07:26.986
J“ Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh J‘

07:28.032 --> 07:29.863
J“ Ooh, ooh

07:33.829 --> 07:35.740
- Commander Aneela
has been very pleased

07:35.748 --> 07:37.739
with the detailed intelligence
you've given so far.

07:37.750 --> 07:39.911
- Good. Perhaps she can answer
some of my questions today.

07:39.919 --> 07:42.706
-All in due time, Delle Seyah.
- I am Seyah Kendry,

07:42.713 --> 07:44.169
daughter of the Nine,
Protector of Qresh.

07:44.173 --> 07:46.004
You can address me as such.

07:46.008 --> 07:48.044
- Of course, Seyah Kendry.
No offense intended.

07:48.052 --> 07:49.417
- I think I'll start
with the obvious question

07:49.428 --> 07:51.214
of how she looks.

07:51.221 --> 07:53.712
- I'm sorry, Seyah Kendry?
- I'm thinking out loud, Gander.

07:53.724 --> 07:57.967
It doesn't require
a response every time.

07:57.978 --> 08:00.970
- Seyah Kendry...

08:00.981 --> 08:03.097
a word of advice.

08:03.108 --> 08:05.895
As the Commander's
most senior advisor,

08:05.903 --> 08:09.111
it might be best to run
any questions by me first.

08:09.114 --> 08:10.979
You know how rulers can be,

08:10.991 --> 08:15.109
especially ones
as, uh... passionate as Aneela.

08:15.120 --> 08:20.456
- Yes, I do known how rulers
can be because I am one.

08:20.459 --> 08:22.916
And I'm sorry,
who are you to decide

08:22.920 --> 08:26.833
what she can or cannot hear?

08:39.979 --> 08:43.096
- Kendry,
welcome to my war room.

08:44.942 --> 08:46.773
- It's impressive.

08:46.777 --> 08:49.860
- I'm so pleased you survived
the transfusion.

08:49.863 --> 08:52.149
I upgraded you
from whatever gutter green

08:52.157 --> 08:54.819
that was inside of you.
- What do you mean?

08:54.827 --> 08:57.034
- Well, there are two strains
of Hullen.

08:57.037 --> 08:59.119
Some were made to take orders.

08:59.123 --> 09:01.489
Some were born to give them.

09:01.500 --> 09:04.242
I made sure you played
for my team.

09:11.010 --> 09:13.797
- How many Hullen are there?

09:13.804 --> 09:15.760
- A lot.

09:18.851 --> 09:20.762
- Be careful out there, guys.

09:20.769 --> 09:22.976
- Just had to press
that button, didn't you?

09:22.980 --> 09:24.311
- I really did.

09:24.314 --> 09:26.179
- Does any of this seem
familiar to you?

09:26.191 --> 09:27.852
- Well, seen one
frozen wasteland,

09:27.860 --> 09:29.521
you've seen them all.

09:29.528 --> 09:31.234
Any idea yet
how the ship bounced here?

09:31.238 --> 09:32.978
- Not yet,
but I'll figure it out.

09:32.990 --> 09:34.480
- I'd be happy to take
a look at it.

09:34.491 --> 09:37.107
- I will... figure... it out.

09:37.119 --> 09:39.235
- So how we doing
with those rad readings

09:39.246 --> 09:40.952
you were getting, Zeph?

09:40.956 --> 09:42.821
- Well, I'm monitoring
the derived units

09:42.833 --> 09:44.494
of ionizing radiation to measure
the stochastic effects

09:44.501 --> 09:47.208
on human tissue... whoa.
Tell me something...

09:47.212 --> 09:48.292
Do you like
your internal organs,

09:48.297 --> 09:50.162
or do you like-like them?

09:50.174 --> 09:52.210
- Uh, radiation's high...
Don't stay out too long.

09:52.217 --> 09:54.208
- But do the readings match
the ones you got from the ship?

09:54.219 --> 09:56.881
- Yeah, this ship has definitely
been here before.

10:02.352 --> 10:03.967
- Can you describe it?

10:03.979 --> 10:06.311
- Old-timey.

10:06.315 --> 10:09.807
Deeply wrong.

10:09.818 --> 10:13.026
Honey, we are so not home.

10:13.030 --> 10:15.362
- Let's go meet
the neighbors, shall we?

10:21.038 --> 10:22.903
- Oh, this isn't
unbelievably creepy.

10:22.915 --> 10:24.155
We don't have
any protective gear.

10:24.166 --> 10:25.372
We can't stay long.

10:25.375 --> 10:28.208
— Sweep and clear,
house by house.

10:28.212 --> 10:30.328
- Need backup?

10:30.339 --> 10:32.751
- You'll know
if you hear shooting.

10:34.384 --> 10:37.217
- Let's get out of here before
our piss starts glowing.

10:37.221 --> 10:40.930
- Your piss won't glow
for another 58 minutes.

11:04.081 --> 11:06.072
- Guys, you gotta see this.

11:06.083 --> 11:09.325
Looks like a time capsule
from the first colonies.

11:09.336 --> 11:13.249
It's like if...
living dolls had homes.

11:13.257 --> 11:15.964
- Guys, I'm seeing evidence
of a shield generator,

11:15.968 --> 11:17.378
possibly a rad blocker.

11:17.386 --> 11:19.968
It was shut down a while ago,
but this place...

11:19.972 --> 11:22.930
It's old, like, 100 years old.

11:22.933 --> 11:24.889
— So who needed
the shield, then?

11:28.981 --> 11:31.097
- Anybody hear that?
- Hear what?

11:31.108 --> 11:33.349
- Great, I'm starting
to imagine things.

11:36.989 --> 11:40.322
Wait, I've seen this before.

11:42.452 --> 11:44.943
- Today, we will
talk about smiling.

11:44.955 --> 11:46.320
Smiling isn'tjust
with your mouth...

11:46.331 --> 11:48.287
See?

11:48.292 --> 11:50.123
- What the shit?

11:50.127 --> 11:52.243
- What is it?
You need backup?

11:52.254 --> 11:53.790
- I might need therapy.

11:59.970 --> 12:03.963
- This place is Hullen.

12:03.974 --> 12:05.259
Or it was.

12:05.267 --> 12:07.132
- Then why the radiation shield?

12:07.144 --> 12:09.476
The last I checked, Hullen...
They didn't worry about

12:09.479 --> 12:11.470
shit like that because
they heal instantly.

12:11.481 --> 12:15.975
- You have to smile with
your eyes too, like this.

12:15.986 --> 12:17.271
Now you try.

12:17.279 --> 12:21.238
- It's some kind
of training hologram.

12:23.660 --> 12:27.027
Dutch, remember what Sabine said
when people get Hullenized?

12:27.039 --> 12:31.999
- They lose the ability
for normal human connection.

12:32.002 --> 12:34.118
A place like this, they could
learn how to fake it.

12:42.262 --> 12:44.002
- I didn't touch anything.
I swear.

12:44.014 --> 12:45.094
- What the hells is that?

12:45.098 --> 12:47.384
There!

12:47.392 --> 12:50.179
— Um, my rad readings just
spiked like I've never seen.

12:50.187 --> 12:51.723
Some sort of solar flare, maybe?

12:51.730 --> 12:55.222
It's about to...
What does that mean?

12:55.234 --> 12:57.065
- I think it's a countdown.

12:57.069 --> 12:59.060
Dutch, D'Av,
I don't know what's happening,

12:59.071 --> 13:00.732
but, wherever you are,
get inside, find shelter.

13:00.739 --> 13:02.320
- What, Johnny?
Who is it?

13:02.324 --> 13:05.066
- No, not who, but what.
It's the sun.

13:05.077 --> 13:07.363
Big flare coming your way...
You have to take cover!

13:08.747 --> 13:09.532
Close your eyes!

13:20.300 --> 13:22.632
- How'd we get into orbit?
- I'll know once I get

13:22.636 --> 13:24.172
control of the ship.
- Why don't you have control?

13:24.179 --> 13:25.760
You're a pilot.
I don't... I don't pilot.

13:25.764 --> 13:27.345
— The flare's EMP shorted
everything out,

13:27.349 --> 13:29.180
same as what's screwing
with our comms.

13:29.184 --> 13:30.970
- What the hells is going on?

13:30.978 --> 13:32.969
- The last thing I heard
Johnny say was "flare."

13:32.980 --> 13:35.062
We need to get back to the ship.
- How do we do that, exactly?

13:35.065 --> 13:37.772
I can't find my ass right now.
- Start walking due east.

13:37.776 --> 13:40.392
- You know where east is?
- Well, it's not like it moved.

13:40.404 --> 13:42.736
Gun, someone took my gun!

13:42.739 --> 13:44.240
- New plan, this way!

13:47.744 --> 13:50.326
- Once we return to the Quad
with your armada behind me...

13:50.330 --> 13:54.073
Us, the Nine,
will do whatever we...

13:54.084 --> 13:56.746
You...

13:56.753 --> 13:59.415
want... Aneela.

13:59.423 --> 14:02.210
- Interesting proposal,
well-thought out.

14:02.217 --> 14:05.380
However, the Commander
has already decided that,

14:05.387 --> 14:07.969
with the loss
of our resources in that area,

14:07.973 --> 14:10.055
it was best to wait and gather
intelligence before...

14:10.058 --> 14:13.266
- I'm aware of my decisions,
Gander.

14:13.270 --> 14:14.931
I made them.

14:16.732 --> 14:20.145
I haven't heard
from my father in weeks.

14:20.152 --> 14:22.393
I brought you here
because I know you're his ally

14:22.404 --> 14:24.110
in the Quad.

14:24.114 --> 14:26.150
Where is he?

14:26.158 --> 14:29.696
- Well, I'm... I'm sorry
to be the bearer of such news,

14:29.703 --> 14:33.241
but... your father is gone.

14:33.248 --> 14:34.909
- Gone where?

14:40.422 --> 14:42.037
- He's dead.

14:46.053 --> 14:49.011
- Oh.

14:49.014 --> 14:50.379
I see.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.722
- But I can at least
tell you what happened.

14:56.355 --> 14:58.471
-Ahh!

14:58.482 --> 15:00.143
- No.

15:00.150 --> 15:03.142
-Ahh!

15:03.153 --> 15:07.396
- Now you stay...
and you see what you've done.

15:11.495 --> 15:12.780
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

15:12.788 --> 15:14.153
Better now that I can see.

15:16.291 --> 15:19.078
- Shit, we need to find
another way out.

15:19.086 --> 15:21.168
- This way... follow me,
quick!

15:21.171 --> 15:23.127
- Who the hells is that?

15:23.131 --> 15:24.746
- I'll take my chances.

15:27.386 --> 15:29.172
- There was a key and
the key is a seed...

15:29.179 --> 15:30.794
- All right, we got squiggly
numbers again.

15:30.806 --> 15:32.467
- A circle's a seed,
a seed is a tree...

15:32.474 --> 15:34.180
- Or are those letters?
-Aseed is a circle...

15:34.184 --> 15:36.391
- Are you... praying?
- What? No, shut up.

15:36.395 --> 15:39.057
You're praying!

15:39.064 --> 15:41.225
I'm so sorry,
I get aggressive when anxious.

15:41.233 --> 15:42.393
Did you get controls back?

15:42.401 --> 15:45.359
- Sure, sure, almost.

15:45.362 --> 15:47.148
- So we are gonna die.
Okay, I'm gonna die.

15:47.155 --> 15:48.235
Okay, great.
Uh, oh, my God.

15:48.240 --> 15:49.855
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

15:49.866 --> 15:53.199
hey, hey, hey, hey.
Why did you stay on the ship?

15:53.203 --> 15:55.194
- Because you don't like me or
trust me to stay alone?

15:55.205 --> 15:57.491
- What? No.

15:57.499 --> 15:59.831
Well, okay, yes, fine,

15:59.835 --> 16:02.121
but what
did you stay here to do?

16:02.129 --> 16:04.245
- Compile data so I can better
understand the situation.

16:04.256 --> 16:06.338
- Or, put another way,
you saw weird shit happening,

16:06.341 --> 16:08.172
and you wanted to figure it out,

16:08.176 --> 16:11.919
which makes you...
- Uh, super cool, always single?

16:11.930 --> 16:15.047
- Mm, or, put another way...

16:17.519 --> 16:19.475
A nerd.
And the thing about nerds

16:19.479 --> 16:22.812
is that we save the day
way more than people think.

16:22.816 --> 16:26.479
So let's do some nerdy shit
and save the day.

16:26.486 --> 16:28.522
Radiation, what do we know?

16:28.530 --> 16:31.363
- Uh, okay, um, well,
the solar flare is receding,

16:31.366 --> 16:33.357
so if Dutch and D'Av covered
their eyes, they should be okay.

16:33.368 --> 16:34.824
- Okay, good, that's good.

16:34.828 --> 16:36.364
I'm gonna work on
getting the comms

16:36.371 --> 16:38.202
and controls back online.
You work on predicting

16:38.206 --> 16:40.367
the next flare.
- Great, oh, uh, tiny side note.

16:40.375 --> 16:42.366
Um, repeated exposure will

16:42.377 --> 16:44.914
affect parts of the small organs
like the eyes, leading to

16:44.921 --> 16:46.877
permanent blindness,
and then it gets...

16:46.882 --> 16:50.545
It gets much, much, much...
- Okay, okay, so, less good.

16:50.552 --> 16:53.259
Don't scared.
- Get nerdy.

16:53.263 --> 16:55.254
Okay.

16:55.265 --> 16:57.347
- You're back for the Remnant.
Let me help you.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.557
- Wait, back from where?
What Remnant?

16:59.561 --> 17:03.520
- You can't see a thing with
that thing covering your eyes.

17:04.941 --> 17:06.477
You're sewn shut.

17:06.485 --> 17:07.895
Who did this to you?

17:07.903 --> 17:09.234
- It's all right.
It's a blessing.

17:09.237 --> 17:11.899
What's that?

17:11.907 --> 17:13.863
We have to go fast.

17:13.867 --> 17:14.856
- Don't shoot!

17:21.958 --> 17:25.200
- We're back.
What happened?

17:25.212 --> 17:27.453
- Don't know.
I just did... something.

17:27.464 --> 17:29.170
Let's go.
- I'm not finished

17:29.174 --> 17:30.414
with this test.
- Well, do it later.

17:30.425 --> 17:32.256
We gotta get Dutch
and D'Av first.

17:32.260 --> 17:33.921
- Which won't help us
if the ship boofs again

17:33.929 --> 17:35.510
before we get back!
- Worry about boofs later.

17:35.514 --> 17:39.302
We have to haul ass
before the next flare.

17:39.309 --> 17:42.642
Oh, Zeph, we got company.

17:42.646 --> 17:44.637
Come down slowly.

17:48.568 --> 17:51.230
- I need to test a theory first.

17:51.238 --> 17:52.398
- Zeph?

17:58.370 --> 18:00.611
So, what's fun around here?

18:00.622 --> 18:03.204
You guys got, like, any sports?

18:11.758 --> 18:13.919
- Oh, great,
now I owe Dutch 20 joy.

18:13.927 --> 18:17.545
- Where's Zeph?
- Here's my professional opinion

18:17.556 --> 18:20.593
about your new nerd.
She sucks.

18:20.600 --> 18:21.931
- We have been waiting for you.

18:24.980 --> 18:26.720
- Well, you can keep waiting.
We're not going anywhere

18:26.731 --> 18:28.562
with tall, dark,
and screechy over there.

18:28.567 --> 18:31.559
- Him? Please, don't be
afraid of the Guardians.

18:31.570 --> 18:32.935
They stay above to protect us.

18:32.946 --> 18:36.689
It is the ultimate sacrifice.

18:36.700 --> 18:38.531
- Oh, yeah, much better.

18:38.535 --> 18:42.699
- I am Yarin.
I speak for the Unseeing.

18:42.706 --> 18:44.992
Are you the Undying?

18:48.628 --> 18:51.916
- Y... esss?

18:51.923 --> 18:54.881
- We have so much to show you.

18:54.884 --> 18:56.749
- So the flares are
why you live down here.

18:56.761 --> 18:58.626
- We have to.

18:58.638 --> 19:01.550
The sun poisons everything
aboveground.

19:01.558 --> 19:04.300
Only the Guardians may go.

19:04.311 --> 19:06.051
Bless their sacrifice.

19:06.062 --> 19:07.893
- So those suits
that they're wearing...

19:07.897 --> 19:09.637
It's for the radiation.
- Yeah, I guess being

19:09.649 --> 19:12.561
screechy nightmares
is just a bonus.

19:12.569 --> 19:15.982
- You don't speak like
the Undying I remember.

19:15.989 --> 19:18.981
- We're from a different branch.

19:18.992 --> 19:22.075
- The Last Seer will understand.

19:22.078 --> 19:23.989
- Who is the Last Seer?

19:23.997 --> 19:26.113
When can we talk to him?

19:26.124 --> 19:27.785
- Oh, he'll do more than that.

19:29.669 --> 19:30.954
Go on.

19:33.798 --> 19:35.004
- Stay cool, guys.

19:37.010 --> 19:41.879
All: Look to the stars,
for there they will orbit.

19:41.890 --> 19:45.007
- What the hells is this?

19:45.018 --> 19:50.012
- It's a celebration,
and you are the guests of honor.

19:50.023 --> 19:52.810
- Well, not too bad, all in all.

19:52.817 --> 19:55.604
The slicings and stabbings
we can heal.

19:55.612 --> 19:58.649
It's the beheadings
and Iimb-severings I resent.

19:58.657 --> 20:01.273
Waste of perfectly
good soldiers.

20:04.329 --> 20:07.913
Where are you going?

20:07.916 --> 20:11.784
- To get someone to clean up
the rest of this.

20:11.795 --> 20:14.753
- But my dear,
you're right here.

20:14.756 --> 20:17.998
- I am Delle Seyah Kendry
of the Nine Families of Qresh,

20:18.009 --> 20:20.716
and I will not be spoken to
in this manner by the help.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.927
But you aren't

20:22.931 --> 20:25.718
Delle Seyah Kendry
of the Nine anymore.

20:25.725 --> 20:28.967
You are Hullen.

20:28.978 --> 20:32.186
- You're down here now
with the rest of us in her muck.

20:32.190 --> 20:35.398
And this blood is on your hands,

20:35.402 --> 20:39.111
so clean... it... up.

20:54.754 --> 20:58.042
- So we're thinking
Undying Hullen?

20:58.049 --> 21:01.086
- Probably, but then who are
the mole people?

21:01.094 --> 21:02.880
Hullen can't go blind.

21:02.887 --> 21:05.674
- Silence for the Last Seer.

21:20.029 --> 21:24.989
- Friends, today is a sad day.

21:24.993 --> 21:28.076
One of our children went above.

21:28.079 --> 21:30.946
- But Seer,
the Undying are here.

21:30.957 --> 21:33.744
-Ah, the Undying, yes.

21:33.752 --> 21:36.414
Yarin, as speaker
of the Unseeing,

21:36.421 --> 21:38.787
perhaps you could lead
the sermon.

21:38.798 --> 21:43.713
I'm sure our new friends would
love to hear about the faithful.

21:50.769 --> 21:56.014
- Many years ago, we came to
this place to serve the Undying,

21:56.024 --> 21:59.892
immortal gods
that so loved humans,

21:59.903 --> 22:03.896
they sought to learn our ways,
to honor us.

22:03.907 --> 22:05.772
- Well, that's one way
to put it.

22:05.784 --> 22:08.821
- But then, they left,
and it was not ours

22:08.828 --> 22:10.989
to question why.

22:10.997 --> 22:14.114
Nor when they took away
the shields that protected us.

22:14.125 --> 22:15.456
But did we weaken?

22:15.460 --> 22:16.495
- No.
- Never!

22:16.503 --> 22:17.834
- Did we break faith?

22:19.964 --> 22:25.834
Because we had the Last Seer,
a miracle.

22:25.845 --> 22:28.962
He promised us
that you would return.

22:28.973 --> 22:33.057
He told us that our blindness
was a gift.

22:33.061 --> 22:35.973
A gift we even
gave to our children.

22:35.980 --> 22:39.973
We stitched their eyes at birth
so that their first sight

22:39.984 --> 22:45.024
would be our gods, returned.

22:45.031 --> 22:46.896
And now you have.

22:46.908 --> 22:51.527
- This is starting get...
what comes after awkward?

22:51.538 --> 22:54.951
- But not all of us
stayed faithful.

22:54.958 --> 22:59.793
One of us went aboveground
against my word.

22:59.796 --> 23:03.960
- But Seer, surely today we...
- She disobeyed my word!

23:07.011 --> 23:12.256
And so now, it is upon us
to show our new friends

23:12.267 --> 23:14.223
what comes from that.
- Dutch...

23:14.227 --> 23:17.264
- Wait.
He's baiting us,

23:17.272 --> 23:20.230
trying to draw us out.

23:20.233 --> 23:22.064
- Please, I'm so sorry.

23:22.068 --> 23:24.855
- Your stitches are a gift,
but your eyes

23:24.863 --> 23:30.108
belong to the Unseeing, and you
don't deserve them anymore.

23:30.118 --> 23:33.485
Okay, waiting's over.

23:36.082 --> 23:40.542
- They are Unseeing.
I am not.

23:40.545 --> 23:42.035
Take them.

23:48.052 --> 23:49.963
- So we tell Turin about this,
we're gonna skip the part

23:49.971 --> 23:52.212
where we got jumped
by a bunch of blind dudes, cool?

23:52.223 --> 23:53.383
- Well, it wouldn't be
an issue if you haven't gone

23:53.391 --> 23:55.347
and gotten a new nerd.

23:55.351 --> 23:57.558
- You're the one who left.
- Yeah, and I said that I was

23:57.562 --> 23:59.598
sorry about that.
- Are you kidding me?

23:59.606 --> 24:02.018
For the first time in our lives,
you're the one who took off,

24:02.025 --> 24:03.856
and I got to stay
and be the responsible one.

24:03.860 --> 24:05.350
llovedit
- Well, then I'm sorry that

24:05.361 --> 24:08.979
I ruined your nice, new setup.
My bad, all of it.

24:13.620 --> 24:16.077
- Johnny, you know
I'm glad you're back,

24:16.080 --> 24:17.991
but that doesn't mean things
aren't gonna be weird.

24:17.999 --> 24:19.580
You left.

24:19.584 --> 24:22.041
This is what coming back
feels like.

24:23.963 --> 24:25.419
- You know, I find people
are always more honest

24:27.091 --> 24:29.002
Something about the dark.

24:29.010 --> 24:30.966
It makes us all vulnerable.

24:30.970 --> 24:33.006
- If the other Undying learn
of how you've treated us...

24:33.014 --> 24:36.302
- Yeah, what will you do?
Tell the gods?

24:36.309 --> 24:39.016
I know you're not one of them.

24:39.020 --> 24:41.932
You tried to save that girl.
That was never their way.

24:44.609 --> 24:46.941
Who are you?

24:46.945 --> 24:49.857
Where did you get that ship?

24:51.324 --> 24:54.612
- Hey, hey, leave her alone.

24:54.619 --> 24:56.610
Hey, asshole...
- You attacked the Last Seer!

24:56.621 --> 24:59.829
- Ahh!
- Listen to this, prick.

25:06.339 --> 25:08.204
I know I should
feel worse about punching

25:08.216 --> 25:11.208
an old blind dude, but I don't,
and I'm cool with that.

25:11.219 --> 25:13.676
- Oh, what was that
horrible sound?

25:13.680 --> 25:15.466
- Ultra high frequency,
figured their hearing

25:15.473 --> 25:17.259
would be heightened,
and they'd get their ass kicked

25:17.266 --> 25:19.097
by a shriek.
- Does that mean we're about to

25:19.102 --> 25:21.013
get rushed by those screaming
stalker things?

25:21.020 --> 25:22.976
- No, it was directional.
No one else should've heard.

25:22.981 --> 25:24.972
- Then let me take you
to The Room That Sings,

25:24.983 --> 25:26.974
to find the Remnant.

25:26.985 --> 25:28.646
- The Remnant, what is that?
- Yeah, good question.

25:28.653 --> 25:31.315
- It's what you came for
the last time you were here.

25:31.322 --> 25:33.438
- We've never been here before.
- Yes, you have.

25:33.449 --> 25:35.405
You came here three days ago.

25:35.410 --> 25:37.116
You said you needed
to find the Remnant,

25:37.120 --> 25:39.031
or the lady would come
and kill everyone.

25:39.038 --> 25:39.663
- I did?

25:40.748 --> 25:41.908
- You came here in that ship.

25:47.880 --> 25:50.007
- Underground, there is nothing
but whispers everywhere.

25:52.719 --> 25:55.756
I like to go aboveground
and just hear nothing.

26:01.644 --> 26:05.728
I didn't know how you came.
I just know you were there.

26:12.071 --> 26:13.857
You said you needed the Remnant,

26:13.865 --> 26:14.945
that it was important,
and that we were

26:14.949 --> 26:17.782
keeping it safe for you.

26:17.785 --> 26:19.070
I told you I didn't know
what that was,

26:19.078 --> 26:21.694
but the Last Seer might.

26:21.706 --> 26:26.871
But then the alarm sounded,
and you had to leave.

26:26.878 --> 26:30.041
But you said you'd come back
and take me away with you.

26:30.048 --> 26:33.757
And now you're here.

26:33.760 --> 26:36.092
- You can't see.
How do you know it was me?

26:39.724 --> 26:41.760
- I know that chin.

26:41.768 --> 26:44.851
And that voice.
- It is adorable.

26:47.857 --> 26:49.848
- Johnny, I don't remember
any of this.

26:49.859 --> 26:54.649
I swear to you, if this is true,
it isn't just bad... it's crazy.

26:54.655 --> 26:56.395
- Compared to what?
Stabbing me,

26:56.407 --> 26:58.739
switching bodies with Khlyen,
making eyeballs explode?

26:58.743 --> 27:01.610
On D'Av the magic pony scale,
this is a five, maybe a six.

27:01.621 --> 27:03.862
- Johnny, this isn't funny.

27:05.625 --> 27:09.914
- I know, but I'm back now,
and we will figure it out

27:09.921 --> 27:11.786
like we always do, and we can
start by figuring out

27:11.798 --> 27:13.789
why you came here
in the first place.

27:13.800 --> 27:17.008
- Then let me take you
to The Room That Sings.

27:17.011 --> 27:18.672
- Well, that sounds better
than the room

27:18.679 --> 27:20.670
that shoots you a bunch.

27:20.681 --> 27:25.050
- You do realize
I'm the one with the gun,

27:25.061 --> 27:28.144
and you're the one surrounded
by a bunch of blind,

27:28.147 --> 27:31.105
religious lunatics?
- Not much of a believer.

27:31.109 --> 27:34.897
- I am the Last Seer.
My life is a miracle.

27:34.904 --> 27:38.021
-And stitching
little girls' eyes closed...

27:38.032 --> 27:39.897
what kind of miracle is that?

27:39.909 --> 27:43.697
- Don'tjudge belief until
you know where it came from.

27:43.704 --> 27:46.992
The gods decreed.
- The gods who ran this camp

27:46.999 --> 27:50.127
were using it as a training
facility to impersonate humans.

27:50.128 --> 27:51.868
— The gods that were
here before...

27:51.879 --> 27:54.211
- Are an alien force of
plasma-based parasites.

27:54.215 --> 27:57.082
We call them Hullen,
and we want to know

27:57.093 --> 27:58.799
why they all left.

28:03.224 --> 28:04.885
- Who said they all left?

28:10.690 --> 28:14.228
- The Room That Sings.
Isn't it beautiful?

28:14.235 --> 28:18.228
- I'm not sure if it's singing,
but it sure is gorgeous.

28:18.239 --> 28:22.778
I mean, this ship is old,
like, 100 years old.

28:22.785 --> 28:24.696
Surprised it still runs.

28:24.704 --> 28:28.037
- You're Hullen, aren't you?

28:28.040 --> 28:30.497
- Is that your question?

28:30.501 --> 28:34.164
- No.

28:34.172 --> 28:37.881
My question is,
if they all left,

28:37.884 --> 28:40.500
why did you stay?

28:40.511 --> 28:45.050
- Because he told me to.

28:45.057 --> 28:47.799
- Why is it that you think
this Remnant is here?

28:47.810 --> 28:50.142
- This is a room
where no one is allowed.

28:50.146 --> 28:52.182
Not even Yarin.

28:52.190 --> 28:54.055
If something were important,
I'm sure the Seer

28:54.066 --> 28:55.727
would hide it here.

28:55.735 --> 28:57.225
Can you see it?
- I still don't know

28:57.236 --> 28:59.773
what it is
that we're looking for.

28:59.780 --> 29:01.907
- Try looking at this.

29:01.908 --> 29:05.992
Security cam,
last day on record.

29:05.995 --> 29:08.737
You recognize anyone?

29:08.748 --> 29:12.286
- Khlyen. That's what
he called himself, anyway.

29:12.293 --> 29:14.534
I'd been running
this reintegration camp

29:14.545 --> 29:17.252
for 100 years,
and along he comes

29:17.256 --> 29:19.918
to shut it down.

29:19.926 --> 29:24.795
Took the recruits,
left the human slaves and me.

29:24.805 --> 29:27.888
- Why?
- No, my turn.

29:27.892 --> 29:29.757
Where'd you get the ship?

29:29.769 --> 29:32.101
- We found it.
Khlyen must have left it.

29:32.104 --> 29:34.095
Did he come up with
this religion?

29:34.106 --> 29:35.971
What's the point
of all this bullshit?

29:35.983 --> 29:37.063
- When the shields
were shut down,

29:37.068 --> 29:38.979
they went blind in weeks.

29:38.986 --> 29:41.898
They came up with
the whole Unseeing thing.

29:41.906 --> 29:45.148
IthoughL
"What harm could fables do?"

29:45.159 --> 29:47.616
- And why not get treated
like a living god

29:47.620 --> 29:49.201
while you waited, huh?

29:49.205 --> 29:52.288
- It has its benefits.

29:52.291 --> 29:54.327
Besides...

29:54.335 --> 29:56.576
Khlyen said he was coming back.

29:56.587 --> 29:59.829
That isn't bullshit, is it?

29:59.840 --> 30:01.580
- Is that your question?

30:01.592 --> 30:05.255
- My question is "Is Khlyen
coming back for it?"

30:05.263 --> 30:10.974
- Yes, now go and get it.

30:10.977 --> 30:13.309
- Get what?

30:13.312 --> 30:18.852
— The Remnant.
- Which is?

30:18.859 --> 30:24.195
If you don't know what it is,
it's not for you, is it?

30:24.198 --> 30:28.191
Why are you really here?

30:28.202 --> 30:30.363
- Khlyen's dead.

30:33.124 --> 30:37.037
- It's Khlyen. He must've left
whatever the hells it is.

30:37.044 --> 30:38.784
Did you recognize him
from that video?

30:40.214 --> 30:43.081
Right, um, um...

30:45.636 --> 30:47.251
Here.

30:50.933 --> 30:54.642
This is his symbol.

30:54.645 --> 30:58.854
If he left anything,
this might be on it.

30:58.858 --> 31:02.942
Do you recognize this?

31:02.945 --> 31:04.151
- I know that shape.

31:04.155 --> 31:05.395
Come with me.

31:05.406 --> 31:07.271
- Oh, hey, that's okay,

31:07.283 --> 31:09.990
I'll just download this first,
find Dutch, maybe find us

31:09.994 --> 31:12.155
a rescue ship too.
Does that sound good?

31:12.163 --> 31:14.154
- Perfect, love ya.

31:16.083 --> 31:19.325
- Khlyen is dead?
No, no, no, he can't...

31:19.337 --> 31:21.077
- I saw it with my own eyes.

31:21.088 --> 31:23.921
He sacrificed himself
to poison the Arkyn pool

31:23.924 --> 31:26.381
and free the Arkyn born.
He's not coming back.

31:26.385 --> 31:29.969
- I... I have been waiting here
for 30 years.

31:29.972 --> 31:33.055
I... I watched these people
lose everything.

31:33.059 --> 31:34.720
I've let them believe
whatever they needed.

31:34.727 --> 31:37.685
I've let them stitch
their own children's eyes!

31:37.688 --> 31:41.146
- But what do you care
about a bunch of slaves?

31:41.150 --> 31:44.267
— Well... Well, I don't,
I mean, ljust, I...

31:44.278 --> 31:46.394
- Do you need your goggles
when you go out now?

31:46.405 --> 31:48.270
Do you get sick afterwards?

31:48.282 --> 31:53.151
Are you starting to feel things
even for the Unseeing?

31:53.162 --> 31:55.403
You've been cleansed.

31:55.414 --> 31:58.906
You're not Hullen anymore.

31:58.918 --> 32:00.408
You're human.

32:00.419 --> 32:04.207
— Rejoice, the Undying
have returned!

32:04.382 --> 32:06.247
- Returned, rejoice.

32:10.388 --> 32:13.551
- Come gather... the Undying
have returned.

32:14.058 --> 32:15.923
- Can you see them?

32:15.935 --> 32:17.391
- Come gather... the Undying
have returned.

32:17.395 --> 32:20.432
- No, I see nothing.

32:20.439 --> 32:23.556
- But I can hear them.
We can hear the ships!

32:23.567 --> 32:24.852
- Dutch, you there?

32:24.860 --> 32:26.396
- Bit busy.

32:26.404 --> 32:27.689
This apocalypse thanks to you?

32:27.696 --> 32:29.482
- Yeah, well,
I couldn't find you,

32:29.490 --> 32:31.446
so I had to think fast.
Phase one complete.

32:31.450 --> 32:32.986
I used our hologram friend
to get you topside.

32:32.993 --> 32:34.699
I'm blasting ship sounds
to buy us time.

32:34.703 --> 32:37.410
Still no sign of Zeph.
- Great, phase two?

32:37.415 --> 32:39.497
- I'm working on it.
Just give me some more time.

32:39.500 --> 32:41.616
- It's the children's duty
to care for the altar.

32:41.627 --> 32:43.583
We're not supposed to know
what's inside it,

32:43.587 --> 32:46.954
but I opened it once.
I'm not very good with rules.

32:48.884 --> 32:50.545
It's in there.

32:54.432 --> 32:57.640
-Ah, now that looks
like something you'd call

32:57.643 --> 32:59.144
a Remnant.

32:59.145 --> 33:00.601
- Yeah, but what is it?

33:00.604 --> 33:02.640
- Whatever it is
I came for, I guess.

33:02.648 --> 33:04.639
But we need to go.

33:07.445 --> 33:08.730
What's wrong?

33:08.737 --> 33:11.023
I promised I'd take you,
apparently.

33:11.031 --> 33:14.114
- Yeah, but I didn't actually
think you'd come back.

33:14.118 --> 33:15.949
What if it's awful?

33:19.623 --> 33:22.160
- You wanna know the truth?

33:22.168 --> 33:24.659
Some of it will be awful,
but some of it

33:24.670 --> 33:28.629
will be beautiful too.
You'll see.

33:28.632 --> 33:32.124
But you get to choose, okay?

33:32.136 --> 33:35.094
— Rejoice, the Undying
have returned.

33:35.097 --> 33:39.010
- Okay, I'll do it.
- Returned, rejoice.

33:39.018 --> 33:42.761
- It's the Chin, isn't it?

33:42.771 --> 33:46.104
- Rejoi... da...

33:48.068 --> 33:51.435
- What's happening?
Where are the Undying?

33:51.447 --> 33:53.483
- Johnny?
- I don't know what it is.

33:53.491 --> 33:56.858
It's some sort of power surge,
but I'm coming to get you now.

33:59.747 --> 34:01.988
- Khlyen is not coming back,
is he?

34:01.999 --> 34:03.990
- No, that's what I keep
telling you.

34:04.001 --> 34:05.207
No one is.
You've got to tell them

34:05.211 --> 34:07.668
the truth.
- The truth?

34:07.671 --> 34:10.083
That all this is for nothing?

34:10.090 --> 34:12.126
They did everything for a lie?

34:12.134 --> 34:14.511
They'll turn on me.
It's over.

34:14.512 --> 34:16.002
- It doesn't have to be.

34:16.013 --> 34:18.095
You can still save them.

34:18.098 --> 34:23.593
- Friends, Unseeing,
it's been a long, hard road,

34:23.604 --> 34:26.767
and now it appears it'll be
a little bit longer.

34:26.774 --> 34:30.107
This woman is a false prophet.
- What are you doing?

34:30.110 --> 34:34.023
- She's tempting you,
but you are strong.

34:34.031 --> 34:36.773
You are the Unseeing,
and we will stay here

34:36.784 --> 34:40.197
until we are saved.

34:40.204 --> 34:43.742
Do you believe?
- Yes, Seer, always.

34:43.749 --> 34:45.080
- Then kill the liar.

34:45.084 --> 34:46.244
All: Kill her!

34:46.252 --> 34:49.494
- Show the Undying your faith.

34:49.505 --> 34:51.245
- Johnny, get fighty out here!

34:51.257 --> 34:54.124
- Hold them off...
I'm almost there!

34:55.261 --> 34:58.094
- Kill her.

34:58.097 --> 35:00.713
- The sun, go below!

35:00.724 --> 35:02.680
Everyone, go below!

35:08.232 --> 35:10.598
- They've... They've returned.

35:12.152 --> 35:13.562
- Dutch!

35:13.571 --> 35:15.277
Hey, it's me.

35:15.281 --> 35:16.737
I don't know how,
but Zeph is here.

35:16.740 --> 35:19.823
For the record,
I still hate her.

35:19.827 --> 35:21.658
-Ah!

35:22.788 --> 35:24.619
- Careful, careful!

35:24.623 --> 35:27.080
- Relax, I sutured livestock
on my farm all the time.

35:27.084 --> 35:29.040
- This does not make me
feel better, Zeph.

35:29.044 --> 35:30.705
Quinn, we're almost done.

35:30.713 --> 35:32.749
That tickles.

35:32.756 --> 35:37.216
Can I open them now?
- No, wait.

35:41.140 --> 35:43.597
Okay, now.

35:51.692 --> 35:54.559
- Wow, that was way more
rewarding that livestock.

35:56.322 --> 35:58.734
- I know starting over is scary,
but the monks

35:58.741 --> 36:03.155
I'm taking you to
are good people.

36:03.162 --> 36:05.118
Are you crying?

36:05.122 --> 36:09.912
Are you... Zeph?
- No, no, no, it's fine.

36:09.918 --> 36:11.874
It's just like you said.

36:14.298 --> 36:15.913
It's beautiful.

36:15.924 --> 36:19.508
- Well, that's just
a cargo hold, I mean...

36:22.139 --> 36:25.802
But I know what you mean.

36:25.809 --> 36:27.219
What?

36:27.227 --> 36:29.183
- No, it's nothing, I...

36:29.188 --> 36:32.851
I just thought you'd be
better looking.

36:32.858 --> 36:34.849
- Oh.

36:34.860 --> 36:38.694
- But how did you...?
- Sexy, sexy deduction.

36:38.697 --> 36:40.358
- At first, the ship moved
when it was in danger

36:40.366 --> 36:42.277
and came back when it was safe.

36:42.284 --> 36:44.320
But then I realized...
Who was standing near the ship

36:44.328 --> 36:46.364
when it first opened?
Who pressed the controls

36:46.372 --> 36:47.828
to get us here
in the first place?

36:47.831 --> 36:49.696
Dutch, right?

36:49.708 --> 36:51.619
So I thought, hmm,
hey, dumbass, maybe the key

36:51.627 --> 36:54.369
to controlling these ships
is not a code or a button,

36:54.380 --> 36:56.917
but a person,
so I scraped the controls

36:56.924 --> 36:59.757
for her residual DNA,
slapped it on a polymer strip,

36:59.760 --> 37:02.718
and bam, I'm a fancy pilot.

37:02.721 --> 37:04.712
Dutch is the key
to the whole fleet.

37:04.723 --> 37:07.681
So do you want to tell her,
or can I?

37:10.771 --> 37:12.307
You can't still
be angry with me.

37:12.314 --> 37:15.147
- Oh, I really can.
You abandoned us.

37:15.150 --> 37:18.642
- No, I strategically
absented myself from you.

37:18.654 --> 37:20.315
Come on, I weighed the odds.

37:20.322 --> 37:21.937
There was no point both of us
getting captured.

37:21.949 --> 37:23.860
- You really don't get it.

37:23.867 --> 37:26.700
- Fine, next mission,
I'll check with you first

37:26.704 --> 37:28.410
before I do anything amazing.
- There isn't gonna be

37:28.414 --> 37:31.656
a next time.

37:31.667 --> 37:35.285
- But I'm the new nerd.
Dutch said.

37:35.295 --> 37:37.877
- And, as the old nerd,
I'm telling you yourjob

37:37.881 --> 37:39.746
isn't just to be right.

37:39.758 --> 37:43.876
It's to be careful.
It's to protect them.

37:43.887 --> 37:47.220
The missions?
They're not labs.

37:47.224 --> 37:49.385
And Dutch and D'Av
are brave as shit,

37:49.393 --> 37:53.386
but they cannot do what we do,
and they know it.

37:53.397 --> 37:56.434
If we tell them to run
into fire, they will,

37:56.442 --> 37:59.855
so you better be sure
that you can get them back out.

38:01.905 --> 38:05.989
- Is that why you abandoned
your team for months?

38:05.993 --> 38:07.904
To protect them?

38:11.707 --> 38:16.246
- No.
That's why I came back.

38:26.722 --> 38:29.338
And that's why
I'm assigning you this.

38:29.349 --> 38:31.010
Put your ego aside,
and figure out

38:31.018 --> 38:34.761
how to open this for the team.

38:34.772 --> 38:37.309
And then we'll talk again.

38:44.323 --> 38:47.315
- I've missed your way
with smart women, John.

38:47.326 --> 38:49.362
- I missed you too, Luce.

38:51.330 --> 38:52.911
Wait, is that sarcasm?

38:56.376 --> 38:58.241
- So you went on
an instantaneous

38:58.253 --> 38:59.959
interstellar journey,
and you don't remember

38:59.963 --> 39:01.419
anything about it?
- I don't remember

39:01.423 --> 39:03.288
coming on board, I don't
remember flying anywhere.

39:03.300 --> 39:05.256
I don't even know
where else I might've gone.

39:05.260 --> 39:07.125
- Do you remember how to drink?
- Hearing about my woes

39:07.137 --> 39:10.095
makes you think "party".
- The toast isn't for that.

39:10.098 --> 39:11.759
- Finally, my welcome home
pany

39:11.767 --> 39:13.007
I'm not... really sure

39:13.018 --> 39:14.883
why we're doing it here, but...

39:14.895 --> 39:16.806
- It's not for that either.

39:16.814 --> 39:17.894
- Oh.

39:17.898 --> 39:19.809
- We're here to Christen.

39:19.817 --> 39:21.603
D'Av's new fleet.

39:21.610 --> 39:23.350
- Your fleet, you mean.

39:23.362 --> 39:25.899
- I don't think so.
-As much as I hate to admit

39:25.906 --> 39:28.648
that Zeph is right...
you pushed the button.

39:28.659 --> 39:31.776
- No. I didn't.

39:31.787 --> 39:35.029
- You pushed my hand.

39:35.040 --> 39:36.871
Zeph scraped my DNA.

39:36.875 --> 39:39.787
- Wait... he's in charge
of the fleet?

39:39.795 --> 39:42.707
Do you know how insufferable
that's gonna make him?

39:42.714 --> 39:44.705
- But why?
- I don't give a shit.

39:44.716 --> 39:46.172
- That's one approach.

39:46.176 --> 39:49.634
- Khlyen never did anything
without the plan.

39:49.638 --> 39:52.095
The Remnant, these ships...

39:52.099 --> 39:55.057
When he was dying,
he must have used

39:55.060 --> 39:57.722
his weird connection
with D'Avin one last time

39:57.729 --> 40:00.721
to carry it on.

40:00.732 --> 40:02.017
But Khlyen's gone,

40:02.025 --> 40:04.687
and all that matters
is our plan,

40:04.695 --> 40:06.026
OUF war.

40:08.031 --> 40:11.023
These ships are key
to reaching Aneela,

40:11.034 --> 40:13.946
and we're gonna use
the shit out of them.

40:14.663 --> 40:17.325
That's what we're celebrating.

40:17.332 --> 40:19.823
Whatever's coming...

40:19.835 --> 40:22.622
We're gonna be ready for it.

40:28.218 --> 40:30.049
- Aneela.

40:32.723 --> 40:35.180
You need to get up.

40:40.230 --> 40:43.188
You can't lead from a bed.

40:46.194 --> 40:48.936
- What does it matter anymore?

40:52.159 --> 40:54.821
- My mistake.

40:54.828 --> 40:57.069
I thought...

40:57.080 --> 40:58.911
you were your father's daughter.

40:58.916 --> 41:00.827
- I am his only daughter!

41:04.963 --> 41:07.750
Then show me.

41:07.758 --> 41:09.919
Show all of them.

41:09.927 --> 41:12.760
- You know...

41:12.763 --> 41:14.469
nothing...

41:14.473 --> 41:16.213
about me, little bird.

41:16.224 --> 41:19.933
- I know what it's like
to have power fail you.

41:19.937 --> 41:22.098
To be betrayed,

41:22.105 --> 41:26.098
to lose everything you love.

41:28.278 --> 41:30.769
Everything falls, Aneela,

41:30.781 --> 41:32.897
from fathers to empires.

41:32.908 --> 41:36.947
But... we...

41:36.954 --> 41:39.195
are queens.

41:39.206 --> 41:42.243
And queens... rise.

41:51.134 --> 41:53.125
- What do you want,

41:53.136 --> 41:55.513
Qreshi?

41:55.514 --> 42:00.929
- So share in your vengeance
and sit at your table.

42:00.936 --> 42:04.349
I can help you get the woman
who killed your father.

42:04.356 --> 42:08.895
I know exactly how to hurt her.

42:08.902 --> 42:11.188
- Good.

42:11.196 --> 42:14.188
Stay.

42:18.996 --> 42:22.989
- J‘ I hear you calling

42:23.000 --> 42:26.163
J‘ Caught in
the pale blue night J‘

42:26.169 --> 42:29.377
- I still don't understand.

42:29.381 --> 42:31.167
You look so much like...

42:31.174 --> 42:34.166
- We don't say her name.

42:34.177 --> 42:37.135
Ever

42:37.139 --> 42:39.881
Until she's dead.

42:42.894 --> 42:47.388
-J‘Ohoh

42:47.399 --> 42:50.562
J'Oh

42:50.569 --> 42:55.188
J'Oh oh

42:56.825 --> 43:00.238
J‘Oh oh oh oh oh oh
