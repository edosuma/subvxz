ELEMENTARY #707
"From Russia with Drugs"
Closed Captioned

00:00.751 --> 00:02.461
Previously on Elementary...

00:02.461 --> 00:04.463
BELL:
The captain, he's been shot.

00:04.463 --> 00:05.839
WATSON:
So, that's Captain Dwyer.

00:05.839 --> 00:07.216
BELL:
He's gonna cover both squads

00:07.216 --> 00:09.051
till we know more
about Captain Gregson.

00:09.051 --> 00:10.469
HOLMES:
Your real name is

00:10.469 --> 00:12.304
Olga Berezhnaya.

00:12.304 --> 00:14.890
To put it bluntly, you're
an international spy.

00:14.890 --> 00:16.141
You can call me Patrick.

00:16.141 --> 00:17.643
It's not Lieutenant Meers
anymore.

00:17.643 --> 00:19.519
I left the army last year.
I did it.

00:19.519 --> 00:21.563
I didn't really want
to shoot that cop.

00:21.563 --> 00:23.899
He never wavered from his story,
and there's no way to prove

00:23.899 --> 00:26.276
that he knew about Tim Bledsoe's
plan to blow up the ferry.

00:26.276 --> 00:28.654
I didn't tell Patrick Meers
to kill your captain.

00:28.654 --> 00:30.447
I think this is too big
for the NYPD.

00:30.447 --> 00:33.450
The NSA is the only agency
with the technical wherewithal

00:33.450 --> 00:35.661
to untangle this knot.
Agent McNally.

00:35.661 --> 00:37.162
Did you become
a member

00:37.162 --> 00:38.455
of Reichenbach's cabal

00:38.455 --> 00:40.457
before I came to see you
or after?

00:40.457 --> 00:43.001
Our friend doesn't want to
hurt any of you, but I think

00:43.001 --> 00:44.878
it's important you realize
he could hurt all of you.

00:44.878 --> 00:45.837
Don't get in his way.

00:48.465 --> 00:53.011
I'll never forget
the night Tommy got shot.

00:53.011 --> 00:54.972
Don't know how many
of you know this,

00:54.972 --> 00:57.266
but, uh, he and I...

00:57.266 --> 01:00.435
used to work out of the 2-9
for a stretch.

01:00.435 --> 01:02.938
The Yanks were playing the Mets
in the World Series.

01:02.938 --> 01:05.774
That's how long ago it was.

01:05.774 --> 01:07.776
Tommy was a Mets guy.

01:07.776 --> 01:10.112
I, of course, bled Yankees blue.

01:10.112 --> 01:13.156
When I told him that the Yanks
would take it five,

01:13.156 --> 01:14.616
he says, "No way.

01:14.616 --> 01:16.368
Mets in seven."

01:16.368 --> 01:18.620
So we put our money
where our mouths were.

01:18.620 --> 01:20.789
Hundred bucks.

01:20.789 --> 01:22.582
Cut to 18 years later.

01:22.582 --> 01:24.084
Night of.

01:24.084 --> 01:26.211
I'm just getting out
of the shower--

01:26.211 --> 01:28.297
no fantasizing, ladies...

01:28.297 --> 01:29.923
(laughter)

01:29.923 --> 01:32.384
...when I get the call
from a mutual friend.

01:32.384 --> 01:34.720
He says, "Tommy Gregson
took one in the gut

01:34.720 --> 01:36.847
"and one in the back tonight.

01:36.847 --> 01:38.598
They don't think
he's gonna make it."

01:38.598 --> 01:41.226
I just stood there, frozen.

01:41.226 --> 01:43.437
My friend, he goes,
"Hey, you okay?"

01:43.437 --> 01:47.149
I says, "No. I'm not.

01:47.149 --> 01:49.484
Guy still owes me
a hundred bucks."

01:49.484 --> 01:50.861
(laughter)

01:50.861 --> 01:52.863
Now, before I officially return

01:52.863 --> 01:55.699
the 11th
to your friend and mine,

01:55.699 --> 01:58.493
I'm gonna hold something up--
you tell me what it is.

02:00.829 --> 02:04.458
Come on, Novacek, help me out.

02:04.458 --> 02:06.877
I believe that's
your shield, sir.
Exactly.

02:06.877 --> 02:08.754
It's my shield.

02:08.754 --> 02:12.466
We call it that because
it's supposed to protect us,

02:12.466 --> 02:14.343
remind people that
we're part of something bigger,

02:14.343 --> 02:16.345
something strong.

02:16.345 --> 02:19.139
Now, Tommy, I know
you had your shield with you

02:19.139 --> 02:22.434
when you got shot, and obviously
it didn't do much good,

02:22.434 --> 02:24.436
so we chipped in,

02:24.436 --> 02:27.522
and we had one made special
just for you. Marcus?

02:31.401 --> 02:34.029
Ah, you shouldn't have.

02:35.238 --> 02:36.239
(laughing)

02:36.239 --> 02:37.741
(laughter)

02:39.826 --> 02:41.620
Welcome home, Tommy.

02:41.620 --> 02:44.206
Oh, seriously,

02:44.206 --> 02:46.083
I'm, uh, I'm touched.

02:46.083 --> 02:49.252
How about a special round
of applause for Captain Dwyer!

03:02.349 --> 03:03.642
(chuckles)

03:12.526 --> 03:13.944
(sighs)

03:15.487 --> 03:17.155
(knocking)

03:17.155 --> 03:18.740
Got a minute?

03:18.740 --> 03:20.158
Yeah, yeah, sure.
Come on in.

03:21.785 --> 03:24.454
I know my timing
could not be worse,

03:24.454 --> 03:26.581
this being your first
day back and all,

03:26.581 --> 03:29.459
but I wanted you to know,
I'm putting in my papers.

03:29.459 --> 03:32.087
Friday is my last day.

03:32.087 --> 03:33.672
You're kidding.

03:33.672 --> 03:35.674
I got an offer in
the private sector.

03:35.674 --> 03:37.676
It's too good to pass up.

03:37.676 --> 03:40.512
Bree, you're just three years
away from your full pension.

03:40.512 --> 03:43.098
When we went over
your annual evaluation,

03:43.098 --> 03:45.350
I told you I was
putting you in
for a promotion.

03:45.350 --> 03:48.145
You said that was
what you wanted.
It was. Then.

03:48.145 --> 03:49.938
Now...

03:49.938 --> 03:52.065
I want something else.

03:52.065 --> 03:53.942
You're one of my best.

03:53.942 --> 03:55.402
You know that, right?

03:55.402 --> 03:57.529
I appreciate you saying that.

03:57.529 --> 03:58.780
I'm not just saying it.

03:58.780 --> 04:00.615
You sure there's
nothing I can do,

04:00.615 --> 04:02.534
talk you into staying?

04:02.534 --> 04:04.453
Sorry.

04:04.453 --> 04:06.496
But I wanted you know

04:06.496 --> 04:09.875
I appreciate everything
you did for me.

04:09.875 --> 04:12.419
You're the best boss I ever had.

04:12.419 --> 04:14.045
Well, thank you.

04:17.716 --> 04:20.177
(over voice mail):
This is Janice.
Leave a message.

04:20.177 --> 04:22.179
Baby, wherever you are,

04:22.179 --> 04:24.890
whatever you're doing, stop.

04:24.890 --> 04:27.517
Get over here.
Your man crushed it tonight.

04:27.517 --> 04:29.394
You and me...

04:31.229 --> 04:33.899
...we got some celebrating
to do.

04:39.029 --> 04:42.032
Baby, you here?

04:42.032 --> 04:43.617
I tried calling you back,

04:43.617 --> 04:46.036
but I got your... voice mail.

04:46.036 --> 04:47.829
(laughs)

04:47.829 --> 04:50.582
What?

04:50.582 --> 04:52.501
(laughs)

05:01.927 --> 05:04.804
Oh, my God.

05:04.804 --> 05:07.682
Babe, this is
just like the movies.

05:07.682 --> 05:08.934
(gasps)

05:08.934 --> 05:10.143
Oh...

05:10.143 --> 05:12.020
Babe, uh-uh.

05:12.020 --> 05:14.397
I don't care how hard
you worked tonight, okay?

05:14.397 --> 05:15.982
You made a promise
we're gonna celebrate.

05:15.982 --> 05:17.275
(Janice screams)

05:54.521 --> 05:56.982
BELL: His name is Ridley Dineen,
and according to his girlfriend,

05:56.982 --> 05:59.109
he's a lot more interesting
than his rap sheet

05:59.109 --> 06:00.443
would lead you
to believe.

06:00.443 --> 06:03.154
I'm seeing petty theft,
misdemeanor assault.

06:03.154 --> 06:04.573
What's missing?

06:04.573 --> 06:06.199
Apparently, a string
of robberies

06:06.199 --> 06:07.951
perpetrated against
drug dealers.

06:07.951 --> 06:09.452
He was an Omar.

06:10.870 --> 06:12.372
You know, from The Wire?

06:12.372 --> 06:14.040
Scar on his face.
Whistled that creepy song.

06:15.375 --> 06:16.835
I'll loan you my DVDs.

06:16.835 --> 06:18.503
You were saying:
Mr. Dineen made his living

06:18.503 --> 06:20.005
stealing from criminals.

06:20.005 --> 06:22.215
The girlfriend said
he got some hot tip

06:22.215 --> 06:24.259
about a stash house
the other day.

06:24.259 --> 06:25.552
He was supposed to
be flush with cash.

06:25.552 --> 06:27.137
He did the job
last night,

06:27.137 --> 06:28.847
came home with just
under 200 grand.

06:28.847 --> 06:31.182
Then he went all Scrooge
McDuck on his bed.

06:31.182 --> 06:33.560
And who or what
is Scrooge McDuck?

06:33.560 --> 06:34.853
WATSON:
Picture your father

06:34.853 --> 06:36.938
but... as a duck.

06:36.938 --> 06:38.231
He liked to roll
around in his money,

06:38.231 --> 06:39.399
which is the last thing

06:39.399 --> 06:40.650
Dineen did
before he died.

06:40.650 --> 06:42.235
HOLMES:
So a thief and his score

06:42.235 --> 06:44.529
are accounted for--
why are we here?

06:44.529 --> 06:46.781
Couple reasons.
The stash house he knocked off

06:46.781 --> 06:49.743
was supposed to be unguarded,
but CSU found fresh blood

06:49.743 --> 06:51.745
on the barrel
of his nine-millimeter.

06:51.745 --> 06:54.372
So, obviously he shot someone.
We want to know who.

06:54.372 --> 06:56.374
What's the other reason?

06:56.374 --> 06:58.418
Looks like Mr. Dineen died
of an overdose.

06:58.418 --> 06:59.794
I'm still waiting
on the tox screen,

06:59.794 --> 07:00.962
but my money's on fentanyl.

07:00.962 --> 07:02.422
I assume you're familiar.

07:02.422 --> 07:04.132
Synthetic opioid.
A lot of dealers

07:04.132 --> 07:05.925
lace their heroin with it.

07:05.925 --> 07:07.552
BELL:
According to the lab,

07:07.552 --> 07:09.387
the money he stole
was filthy with the stuff,

07:09.387 --> 07:11.473
which would seem to suggest
it was the drug being made

07:11.473 --> 07:12.724
by the dealers he ripped off.

07:12.724 --> 07:14.184
So there's thinking that

07:14.184 --> 07:15.935
he didn't use fentanyl at all,

07:15.935 --> 07:18.146
but he died
from an actual "contact high."

07:18.146 --> 07:20.649
The drugs on the money
were absorbed into his skin.

07:20.649 --> 07:22.150
No.

07:22.150 --> 07:24.444
Fentanyl toxicity cannot
be achieved through touch.

07:24.444 --> 07:25.654
I don't know, man.

07:25.654 --> 07:27.280
I've seen some articles lately.

07:27.280 --> 07:28.990
So have I.
And to be clear,

07:28.990 --> 07:30.950
there are few things on
the planet dirtier than money.

07:30.950 --> 07:32.619
It was once estimated

07:32.619 --> 07:35.455
that 90% of American currency
had traces of cocaine on it.

07:35.455 --> 07:36.915
That, I believe.

07:36.915 --> 07:38.583
What I don't believe
is that touching it

07:38.583 --> 07:40.543
can turn a person
into Hunter S. Thompson.

07:40.543 --> 07:43.421
Fentanyl's supposed
to be... different.

07:43.421 --> 07:45.507
You're both MDs.
Could you tell him?

07:45.507 --> 07:49.094
Um, according to the American
College of Medical Toxicology,

07:49.094 --> 07:51.137
even if you covered both
hands in fentanyl patches,

07:51.137 --> 07:52.514
it would still take 15 minutes

07:52.514 --> 07:54.766
just to receive
a therapeutic level of the drug.

07:54.766 --> 07:55.892
That said,
I couldn't find

07:55.892 --> 07:57.936
any injection marks
on Mr. Dineen.

07:57.936 --> 08:00.105
There weren't any indications
he smoked, either.

08:00.105 --> 08:01.898
It's possible
he ate some fentanyl,

08:01.898 --> 08:03.983
but that would be
pretty unusual.

08:03.983 --> 08:05.652
Look, according to the lab,

08:05.652 --> 08:07.737
the real issue is the potency
of the fentanyl.

08:07.737 --> 08:10.657
We got to find whoever's making
the stuff and shut 'em down,

08:10.657 --> 08:12.575
'cause if we don't, it's
only a matter of time
before more people die.

08:14.452 --> 08:18.331
I'm sorry, I want to help,
it's just...

08:18.331 --> 08:20.166
I already went through it all
with the other cops.

08:20.166 --> 08:22.502
It's just hard, you know?

08:22.502 --> 08:24.879
We understand.
But like we said,

08:24.879 --> 08:27.215
a couple of things
have changed since last night.

08:27.215 --> 08:29.884
You said the money Ridley
stole had drugs on it.

08:29.884 --> 08:33.388
You think maybe that's
what killed him?
Did you touch

08:33.388 --> 08:35.181
any of it?
No.

08:35.181 --> 08:38.268
I saw Ridley and called 911.

08:38.268 --> 08:40.228
And you have no idea
where the money came from?

08:40.228 --> 08:41.479
He had a tip.

08:41.479 --> 08:43.314
Said it was from an old friend.

08:43.314 --> 08:46.276
There was a stash house,
and it wasn't guarded at night.

08:46.276 --> 08:48.695
"Easy money," he said.

08:48.695 --> 08:50.697
All I know.

08:50.697 --> 08:52.699
He never mentioned
the friend's name?

08:52.699 --> 08:55.618
No. But maybe you can
look through his phone?

08:55.618 --> 08:58.246
We did. Nothing jumped out.

08:58.246 --> 09:01.458
We're gonna want to get
a list of associates,

09:01.458 --> 09:04.127
anyone you think might be
the one who reached out.

09:04.127 --> 09:05.754
(sighs):
Sure.

09:05.754 --> 09:08.339
Did Ridley ever use drugs?

09:09.507 --> 09:11.509
(sighs)
Never.

09:11.509 --> 09:12.218
You're sure?

09:13.595 --> 09:15.722
He lost a brother ten years ago.

09:15.722 --> 09:17.807
Heroin.

09:17.807 --> 09:20.268
It's one of the reasons he liked
knocking over drug dealers.

09:20.268 --> 09:22.729
He figured they had it coming.

09:22.729 --> 09:26.399
For a while, I was on meth.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.234
Ridley made me
go to meetings,

09:28.234 --> 09:30.737
and he said he could never
be with anybody who used.

09:30.737 --> 09:33.782
I got clean.

09:33.782 --> 09:35.200
For him.

09:36.910 --> 09:38.995
I know he wasn't
a good guy, but...

09:38.995 --> 09:40.997
(whispers):
he was my guy.

09:47.837 --> 09:50.298
Dineen's car
was a bust.

09:50.298 --> 09:53.218
Nothing that would help us
locate the stash house.

09:53.218 --> 09:55.637
No drug paraphernalia,
either.

09:55.637 --> 09:57.347
And yet I remain convinced

09:57.347 --> 09:59.766
that it wasn't the money
that killed him.

09:59.766 --> 10:02.060
Why, did you find
some fentanyl in here?

10:02.060 --> 10:03.853
No, I just believe
in science.

10:03.853 --> 10:05.230
I know what the science says.

10:05.230 --> 10:07.315
I also know cops
who swear they got sick

10:07.315 --> 10:08.858
just from touching the stuff.

10:08.858 --> 10:11.653
That's the classic
nocebo effect.

10:11.653 --> 10:14.531
The mere suggestion that
a substance can be harmful

10:14.531 --> 10:18.284
causes people to suffer
negative effects after exposure.

10:18.284 --> 10:20.745
You about ready to go?

10:20.745 --> 10:22.956
You didn't see a cat in here
anywhere, did you?

10:22.956 --> 10:24.958
No. Why?

10:24.958 --> 10:26.376
'Cause there's cat hair
everywhere.

10:26.376 --> 10:27.669
Persian,
if I'm not mistaken.

10:27.669 --> 10:29.754
So?

10:29.754 --> 10:33.883
Well, I just didn't see any cat
food or kitty litter anywhere.

10:33.883 --> 10:36.386
Dineen was a professional
armed robber.

10:36.386 --> 10:38.012
Would it really
surprise you to find out

10:38.012 --> 10:39.639
he didn't take great
care of his pet?

10:39.639 --> 10:41.349
(chuckles)

10:41.349 --> 10:43.142
We missed you guys yesterday.

10:43.142 --> 10:44.561
Why?

10:44.561 --> 10:46.646
The welcome-back thing
for the captain.

10:46.646 --> 10:49.232
Oh, yeah.
We, uh...

10:49.232 --> 10:51.484
we were finishing up a matter
for a private client,

10:51.484 --> 10:54.571
but I assure you,
we were there in spirit.

10:54.571 --> 10:58.533
You guys making any progress
with the Meers investigation?

10:58.533 --> 11:00.827
Joan said you were
still kicking it around.

11:00.827 --> 11:03.204
We all know he wasn't
working alone, right?

11:03.204 --> 11:05.832
He shot the captain to protect
his "cell" or whatever.

11:05.832 --> 11:08.668
I'm afraid we haven't made
any progress at all.

11:10.670 --> 11:11.880
(knocking)

11:11.880 --> 11:12.881
(door opens)

11:12.881 --> 11:14.424
Hey. I'm leaving.

11:14.424 --> 11:16.301
I did a hospital canvass.

11:16.301 --> 11:18.219
No one was shot with
a nine-millimeter last night.

11:18.219 --> 11:20.221
Guessing that doesn't bode well

11:20.221 --> 11:22.682
for whoever Ridley Dineen shot
at the stash house.

11:22.682 --> 11:25.101
Could have been the wound
was superficial

11:25.101 --> 11:27.061
and the victim took care
of himself.

11:27.061 --> 11:29.188
Or he's dead,
and his drug-dealing buddies

11:29.188 --> 11:30.648
got rid of his corpse.

11:30.648 --> 11:32.817
You got a sec?
Sure.

11:32.817 --> 11:36.195
Would you close the door?

11:36.195 --> 11:39.324
Is everything okay?

11:39.324 --> 11:41.242
I wanted to talk to you
about Captain Dwyer.

11:41.242 --> 11:44.120
What did you think of him?

11:44.120 --> 11:45.830
He was fine. I mean,

11:45.830 --> 11:47.707
a little brusque,
a little full of himself.

11:47.707 --> 11:50.251
But for the most part,
he left me and Sherlock alone.

11:50.251 --> 11:52.503
He ever make you feel
uncomfortable?

11:52.503 --> 11:54.213
No. Why?

11:54.213 --> 11:57.383
Bree Novacek is leaving
the department.

11:57.383 --> 12:01.262
According to her, it's because
a better job came along.

12:01.262 --> 12:03.222
But you think it's because
of something

12:03.222 --> 12:05.433
that happened
with Captain Dwyer?

12:05.433 --> 12:07.518
He's good at the job.
They wouldn't have tapped him

12:07.518 --> 12:09.103
to run two squads if he wasn't.

12:09.103 --> 12:12.440
But he's also got a reputation.

12:12.440 --> 12:16.611
Doesn't always watch what he
says or does around female cops.

12:16.611 --> 12:18.237
Last year a civilian aide

12:18.237 --> 12:20.239
at the 12th filed
a complaint with the EEO.

12:20.239 --> 12:21.950
Said he pressured her
to go out with him.

12:21.950 --> 12:23.576
When all was said and done,

12:23.576 --> 12:27.038
he received a "one-year
dismissal probation."

12:27.038 --> 12:30.041
Means he could be terminated
if there was another incident.

12:30.041 --> 12:32.835
Suffice it to say, he wouldn't
have been my first choice

12:32.835 --> 12:34.837
to fill in for me here.

12:34.837 --> 12:36.756
Well, I don't know what to say.

12:36.756 --> 12:39.008
I mean, I didn't see him do
anything inappropriate,

12:39.008 --> 12:41.052
but that doesn't mean he didn't.

12:41.052 --> 12:44.389
I got a wife who used to be a
cop and a daughter who still is.

12:44.389 --> 12:46.975
I know both of them have had
their fair share

12:46.975 --> 12:48.643
of Dwyers to deal with.

12:48.643 --> 12:52.230
I know what I want
to happen to guys like that.

12:52.230 --> 12:54.816
I file a complaint, that's it
for him. He's gone.

12:54.816 --> 12:58.027
But Novacek never
even mentioned his name.

12:58.027 --> 13:00.697
Maybe talk to him.

13:00.697 --> 13:02.782
See how he reacts when he hears
what you're thinking.

13:02.782 --> 13:05.159
I mean, that might tell you
everything you need to know.

13:08.496 --> 13:10.873
Hey. How'd it go at
Dineen's apartment?

13:10.873 --> 13:12.458
Poorly.

13:12.458 --> 13:14.293
The location of the stash house
that he robbed

13:14.293 --> 13:15.753
is a secret that he died with.

13:15.753 --> 13:17.296
What are those?

13:17.296 --> 13:19.048
Oh. Gifts from the lab

13:19.048 --> 13:20.883
and the ME's office.

13:20.883 --> 13:22.719
The top one is an
analysis of the blood

13:22.719 --> 13:24.637
that was on Dineen's
nine-millimeter.

13:24.637 --> 13:27.056
They ran it through CODIS,
but they didn't get any matches.

13:27.056 --> 13:29.142
So we still don't know
who he shot.
No.

13:29.142 --> 13:30.768
Uh, the other is the tox screen

13:30.768 --> 13:32.562
that Eugene was waiting for.
He was right.

13:32.562 --> 13:35.523
The drug that killed
Dineen was fentanyl.

13:35.523 --> 13:37.483
Any idea how it got
into his system?

13:37.483 --> 13:38.901
No, but his girlfriend swore
up and down

13:38.901 --> 13:40.570
that he never
would have used drugs.

13:40.570 --> 13:42.321
Apparently,
he didn't even drink.

13:42.321 --> 13:43.906
You agree with me that it
couldn't have been absorbed

13:43.906 --> 13:44.907
through his skin.

13:44.907 --> 13:46.242
I do,

13:46.242 --> 13:47.994
but if she was telling
the truth,

13:47.994 --> 13:49.537
how do we explain the results
from the tox screen?

13:49.537 --> 13:51.247
Thought you'd be home earlier.

13:51.247 --> 13:52.790
Yeah, me, too.

13:52.790 --> 13:54.542
The captain wanted to talk.
What about?

13:54.542 --> 13:55.626
Captain Dwyer.

13:58.087 --> 14:01.883
Did you ever notice
any unusual behavior from him?

14:01.883 --> 14:04.177
Saw him wash his hands
before he urinated once.

14:04.177 --> 14:06.220
Mm. That's not what I meant.

14:06.220 --> 14:08.347
Did you ever see him

14:08.347 --> 14:10.016
acting inappropriately
with anyone?

14:10.016 --> 14:11.601
Bree Novacek, for example?

14:11.601 --> 14:14.687
I never saw anything untoward.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.439
But if I'm honest,
I mostly avoided the man.

14:16.439 --> 14:18.816
He didn't care what you and I
got up to, and I liked that.

14:18.816 --> 14:21.486
Hmm.

14:21.486 --> 14:24.030
It says here there's traces of
albuterol in Dineen's system.

14:24.030 --> 14:25.782
Yeah, to help him breathe.

14:25.782 --> 14:27.784
His girlfriend said that he had
terrible cat allergies.

14:27.784 --> 14:29.410
So why does he own a cat?

14:29.410 --> 14:30.620
Pretty sure he didn't.

14:30.620 --> 14:32.038
Cat hair all over his apartment.

14:36.834 --> 14:38.377
Where are you going?

14:38.377 --> 14:39.462
Back to Dineen's apartment.

14:39.462 --> 14:40.463
Something I've got to check.

14:44.509 --> 14:46.719
You want to tell me
what was so important

14:46.719 --> 14:48.471
I had to meet you
here off-duty?

14:48.471 --> 14:50.640
I think I know how the fentanyl
got into Dineen's system.

14:57.105 --> 14:59.857
So, earlier...

14:59.857 --> 15:03.152
I noticed this inhaler;
I thought he had asthma,

15:03.152 --> 15:05.863
but he didn't.
He had a cat allergy.

15:05.863 --> 15:07.365
I thought you said
there was a bunch

15:07.365 --> 15:08.533
of cat hair on
his furniture.

15:08.533 --> 15:10.785
I did, and there was.

15:10.785 --> 15:13.287
But now I think
it was placed there.

15:13.287 --> 15:14.580
Did you bring those
fentanyl test strips?

15:22.130 --> 15:23.589
(murmurs)

15:31.514 --> 15:34.767
Whoever put the cat hair there

15:34.767 --> 15:38.104
wanted to trigger
an allergy attack

15:38.104 --> 15:40.022
so that Dineen would use
his inhaler.

15:40.022 --> 15:43.151
Why?

15:43.151 --> 15:45.736
Because it was laced
with aerosolized fentanyl.

15:45.736 --> 15:49.115
Two lines.
Positive for fentanyl.

15:49.115 --> 15:51.701
Ridley Dineen's death
was not an accident.

15:51.701 --> 15:53.244
He was murdered.

16:01.419 --> 16:03.588
The lab tested the contents
of the inhaler

16:03.588 --> 16:05.423
and got the same results
Sherlock did.

16:05.423 --> 16:08.217
The chamber was filled
with aerosolized fentanyl.

16:08.217 --> 16:10.678
Now, does that prove
that he died from a hit off that

16:10.678 --> 16:12.221
and not from touching the money?
No.

16:12.221 --> 16:14.390
But it does seem more likely.

16:14.390 --> 16:16.309
Somebody killed him.

16:16.309 --> 16:17.894
WATSON:
We think it's the same person

16:17.894 --> 16:19.729
who tipped him off
about the stash house.

16:19.729 --> 16:21.856
If it was,
that person obviously knew

16:21.856 --> 16:23.816
that the money there
would have fentanyl on it.

16:23.816 --> 16:25.359
He couldn't be sure it would
be enough to kill Dineen,

16:25.359 --> 16:27.195
so he messed
with the inhaler,

16:27.195 --> 16:29.530
probably while Dineen was
out pulling off the heist.

16:29.530 --> 16:31.824
If somebody wanted Dineen dead,

16:31.824 --> 16:34.368
why not just mess
with the inhaler?

16:34.368 --> 16:35.995
Why also send him
after the money?

16:35.995 --> 16:37.705
The money makes the whole thing
look like an accident.

16:37.705 --> 16:40.625
He touched it and OD'd.
End of story.

16:40.625 --> 16:42.752
Who would go to all that trouble

16:42.752 --> 16:45.087
to kill a lowlife
like Ridley Dineen?

16:45.087 --> 16:47.840
Would you believe the
Russian government?

16:47.840 --> 16:49.800
WATSON:
We know how it sounds,

16:49.800 --> 16:53.054
but remember back in 2002,
when Chechen rebels took

16:53.054 --> 16:55.306
a few hundred people hostage
in a theater in Moscow?

16:55.306 --> 16:58.517
Russian troops flooded the place
with some mystery gas.

16:58.517 --> 16:59.977
They thought it was gonna
incapacitate the rebels.

16:59.977 --> 17:01.604
GREGSON:
It did.

17:01.604 --> 17:03.940
But it also killed
a whole bunch of hostages.

17:03.940 --> 17:04.982
Over a hundred.

17:04.982 --> 17:05.900
The Russians would never say

17:05.900 --> 17:07.235
what was in the gas,

17:07.235 --> 17:08.945
but most experts thought it was

17:08.945 --> 17:11.739
a fentanyl derivative
known as Kolokol-1.

17:11.739 --> 17:13.449
Let me guess:

17:13.449 --> 17:16.285
it's the same spray
that was in the inhaler.

17:16.285 --> 17:17.578
Probably.

17:17.578 --> 17:18.704
Probably?

17:18.704 --> 17:21.457
The Russians have never
officially revealed

17:21.457 --> 17:23.709
the chemical structure
of Kolokol-1.

17:23.709 --> 17:27.338
But Sherlock came across it once
when he consulted for MI6.

17:27.338 --> 17:29.340
Apparently,
what he saw is a match

17:29.340 --> 17:31.425
for what the lab found
in the inhaler.

17:31.425 --> 17:34.303
Are we thinking Dineen
was some sort of spy?

17:34.303 --> 17:36.973
'Cause if the whole
d-bag criminal thing

17:36.973 --> 17:40.017
is an act, it's a hell
of a good one.

17:40.017 --> 17:42.645
Crazy as it sounds,
it's possible.

17:42.645 --> 17:45.106
He could have been an operative
for them or some other country.

17:45.106 --> 17:46.774
Which is why Sherlock
has gone to have

17:46.774 --> 17:50.403
a conversation with someone
he knows is a Russian spy.

17:50.403 --> 17:52.905
OLGA:
"Hedgehog, Hedgehog,
please come quick.

17:52.905 --> 17:55.533
"Something's happened,
I feel sick.

17:55.533 --> 17:57.577
"Peacock, Peacock,
what's the matter?

17:57.577 --> 18:00.496
"Why are you in such a lather?

18:00.496 --> 18:03.457
"My plume, said Peacock,
someone took it.

18:03.457 --> 18:05.835
Someone mean
and very crooked."

18:05.835 --> 18:07.128
Yes, Max.

18:11.007 --> 18:13.509
Oh, don't stop on my account.
I love a good mystery.

18:13.509 --> 18:15.428
Um, if now's a bad time,

18:15.428 --> 18:17.263
I see that 1:00 is "dance time."

18:17.263 --> 18:19.223
I could come back then.

18:19.223 --> 18:20.683
I know from experience,
children,

18:20.683 --> 18:22.601
your teacher is
an excellent dancer.

18:22.601 --> 18:24.312
Amani, would you mind
taking over for me

18:24.312 --> 18:25.605
while I speak to
my friend outside?

18:36.907 --> 18:39.618
That's quite a transition,
stripper to first grade teacher.

18:39.618 --> 18:41.746
Why the move?

18:41.746 --> 18:44.874
The attention being paid to
your current administration's

18:44.874 --> 18:48.044
relationship with my country
has made it much more difficult

18:48.044 --> 18:49.420
to operate within the U.S.

18:49.420 --> 18:50.671
Mm-hmm.

18:50.671 --> 18:52.131
Too many reporters

18:52.131 --> 18:54.634
and federal investigators
snooping around.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.344
Some of us were extracted.

18:56.344 --> 18:58.095
Some, like myself,
were reassigned.

18:58.095 --> 18:59.930
And I assume you were put here

18:59.930 --> 19:03.100
because so many of the students'
parents work at the U.N.?

19:03.100 --> 19:05.853
What do you want?

19:05.853 --> 19:07.646
Information.

19:07.646 --> 19:10.733
A man named Ridley Dineen
was murdered two nights ago.

19:10.733 --> 19:11.984
Ring any bells?

19:11.984 --> 19:13.736
No.

19:13.736 --> 19:16.030
He was killed with
aerosolized Kolokol-1.

19:17.740 --> 19:20.201
Now you understand
why I came to see you.

19:20.201 --> 19:22.828
The incident in Moscow.

19:22.828 --> 19:25.081
Was Dineen one of yours?

19:25.081 --> 19:26.874
If he was,
I wasn't made aware of him.

19:28.626 --> 19:30.920
It's not like we all get
together on the weekends.

19:30.920 --> 19:33.255
Perhaps he was an...

19:33.255 --> 19:36.425
Perhaps he was an operative
for an enemy of Mother Russia.

19:36.425 --> 19:39.053
It's possible,
but, again,

19:39.053 --> 19:42.973
I was never
made aware of him.

19:42.973 --> 19:44.767
Could you make
yourself aware?

19:44.767 --> 19:47.853
Talk to your handlers.

19:47.853 --> 19:49.313
If the Russian government
was responsible

19:49.313 --> 19:51.690
and it was just a bit
of spy-on-spy violence,

19:51.690 --> 19:53.567
it's possible I
could understand.

19:53.567 --> 19:55.986
And my investigation
might just go away.

19:55.986 --> 19:57.780
I don't believe you.

19:57.780 --> 19:59.949
When we first crossed paths,

19:59.949 --> 20:02.284
I could have outed you
as a spy, but I didn't.

20:02.284 --> 20:05.287
Is that supposed to make me
trust you more or less?

20:05.287 --> 20:07.039
Well, forget about trust.

20:07.039 --> 20:10.501
I'd say that you owed
me one, wouldn't you?

20:12.670 --> 20:14.338
(TV playing indistinctly)

20:22.513 --> 20:24.890
Oh. Look who's out
of his jurisdiction.

20:24.890 --> 20:26.600
Hey, Bill.

20:26.600 --> 20:29.061
What happened?

20:29.061 --> 20:30.813
You finally figure out
the food around the 11th stinks?

20:30.813 --> 20:32.815
(sighs)

20:32.815 --> 20:34.859
Actually, I'm here to talk.

20:34.859 --> 20:36.735
What's up?

20:36.735 --> 20:38.821
Bree Novacek

20:38.821 --> 20:41.282
came to see me
the other day.

20:41.282 --> 20:43.284
Oh.

20:43.284 --> 20:45.828
She's putting in her papers.

20:45.828 --> 20:48.164
Too bad. She's a good cop.

20:48.164 --> 20:50.833
She's one of my best.

20:50.833 --> 20:53.210
I got to ask, Bill.

20:53.210 --> 20:55.254
Don't.
Don't what?

20:55.254 --> 20:57.965
Don't insult me by asking
what you're thinking of asking.

20:57.965 --> 21:00.968
Did something happen
between you two?

21:00.968 --> 21:04.180
You don't listen so good.

21:04.180 --> 21:07.766
If you did or said anything
to make her feel uncomfortable,

21:07.766 --> 21:10.352
that would actually mean
you don't listen so good.

21:10.352 --> 21:13.564
You're still on
dismissal probation.

21:13.564 --> 21:15.024
What the hell
did she tell you, huh?

21:15.024 --> 21:17.109
That I told her a joke?

21:17.109 --> 21:18.611
That I looked at her funny?

21:18.611 --> 21:19.737
Come on, tell me.
I want to know.

21:19.737 --> 21:21.530
About you? Nothing.

21:21.530 --> 21:22.698
Not a word.

21:22.698 --> 21:24.617
But I know your history.

21:24.617 --> 21:26.160
That's it. We're done.

21:26.160 --> 21:27.328
I'm asking you
nice, Bill.

21:27.328 --> 21:29.580
Tell me what you did.

21:29.580 --> 21:32.625
You want to know what I did?
I'll tell you what I did.

21:32.625 --> 21:36.253
I worked my ass off,
covering your squad and mine

21:36.253 --> 21:38.297
while you were laid up
in the hospital.

21:38.297 --> 21:41.383
I did your job, Tommy,
and I did it well.

21:41.383 --> 21:44.512
You want to say something to me?
Say thank you!

21:46.555 --> 21:48.224
(door opens)

21:51.060 --> 21:52.978
(phone ringing)

21:54.563 --> 21:56.190
Hey.

21:56.190 --> 21:57.691
BELL:
Hey. I'm at the morgue.

21:57.691 --> 21:59.235
Pretty sure I'm looking

21:59.235 --> 22:01.237
at the guy
Ridley Dineen shot last night.

22:01.237 --> 22:03.864
So much for bringing him in
alive.

22:03.864 --> 22:06.283
This mean
we found the stash house?

22:06.283 --> 22:09.537
No. That's not where his body
turned up.

22:09.537 --> 22:11.747
Do we at least have
a gang affiliation?

22:11.747 --> 22:14.375
That depends.
Does Mensa count?

22:14.375 --> 22:16.293
Mensa?

22:16.293 --> 22:19.880
This guy--
he's not what we were expecting.

22:19.880 --> 22:22.716
His name's Cecil Troy.
The bullets that killed him

22:22.716 --> 22:25.594
are a match for Ridley
Dineen's nine-millimeter.

22:25.594 --> 22:27.763
He was shot in the chest first.
When he went to the ground,

22:27.763 --> 22:30.683
Dineen moved in close
to finish the job.

22:30.683 --> 22:35.521
So, soft hands, no tattoos,
membership of a high IQ society.

22:35.521 --> 22:36.981
I'm gonna hazard
a guess and say

22:36.981 --> 22:39.441
he wasn't guarding a stash house
when he died.

22:39.441 --> 22:41.569
He was found in his garage
in Dyker Heights.

22:41.569 --> 22:43.404
Pretty sure
he'd just gotten out of his car

22:43.404 --> 22:44.822
when Dineen popped him.

22:44.822 --> 22:46.365
The money with the
fentanyl on it--

22:46.365 --> 22:47.825
you think Dineen stole
it from this guy?

22:47.825 --> 22:49.410
I went through his house
with CSU.

22:49.410 --> 22:51.537
Didn't find any evidence
of fentanyl

22:51.537 --> 22:53.539
or that Mr. Troy was involved

22:53.539 --> 22:55.708
in any other kind
of criminal activity.

22:55.708 --> 22:57.126
When I called Dineen's
girlfriend and asked

22:57.126 --> 22:58.586
if she'd ever
heard of him,

22:58.586 --> 23:00.296
she said no.
Far as she knew,

23:00.296 --> 23:02.256
the only crime Dineen got up to

23:02.256 --> 23:04.508
the other night was knocking
over the stash house.

23:04.508 --> 23:06.135
But this has to be
connected, right?

23:06.135 --> 23:07.094
WATSON:
We were wondering

23:07.094 --> 23:08.804
if Dineen was some sort of spy,

23:08.804 --> 23:10.264
but maybe it's simpler
than that.

23:10.264 --> 23:11.515
This is the guy
the Russians wanted dead.

23:11.515 --> 23:13.309
They hired Dineen
to do it,

23:13.309 --> 23:16.103
and the tip about the stash
house was the payoff.

23:16.103 --> 23:18.105
When they killed Dineen, they
were just tying up a loose end.

23:18.105 --> 23:20.024
According to a
business card

23:20.024 --> 23:23.068
I found, Mr. Troy here
was an art restorer.

23:23.068 --> 23:24.903
Not sure what the Russians
would have against that,

23:24.903 --> 23:27.740
but his office is my next stop
if you two want to join.

23:27.740 --> 23:29.450
AUDREY:
I'm sorry,

23:29.450 --> 23:32.244
but no, I've never heard
of a Ridley Dineen,

23:32.244 --> 23:35.497
and I have no idea why he would
have wanted to hurt Cecil.

23:35.497 --> 23:38.125
Cecil mention any problems
with anyone lately?

23:38.125 --> 23:42.171
No. He was kind and sweet.

23:42.171 --> 23:43.839
If someone had a
problem with him,

23:43.839 --> 23:45.299
he would have
tried to fix it.

23:45.299 --> 23:47.176
That's just how he was.

23:47.176 --> 23:49.011
Cecil was an art restorer,
right?

23:49.011 --> 23:50.596
Technically, yes.

23:50.596 --> 23:51.847
Technically?

23:51.847 --> 23:53.307
He was a chemist.

23:53.307 --> 23:55.476
I am, too,
but when we were in grad school,

23:55.476 --> 23:57.645
we came up with a solvent
that could be used

23:57.645 --> 24:00.272
to clean ancient textiles
without damaging them.

24:00.272 --> 24:03.067
Museums and private
collectors send us their

24:03.067 --> 24:06.195
parchments, their tapestries,
and their rugs, and we use

24:06.195 --> 24:07.780
that chamber to expose them
to our solvent.

24:07.780 --> 24:09.782
It's sort of like

24:09.782 --> 24:11.825
a detergent for a really
expensive washing machine.

24:11.825 --> 24:13.744
You guys ever do

24:13.744 --> 24:15.788
any work
for international clients?

24:15.788 --> 24:18.582
All the time. Sure. Why?

24:18.582 --> 24:20.459
We can't get into
the details just yet,

24:20.459 --> 24:22.670
but there's a possibility
Cecil was killed

24:22.670 --> 24:24.380
on the orders of a
foreign government.

24:24.380 --> 24:26.382
What?
Maybe someone

24:26.382 --> 24:28.842
overseas wasn't very happy
with the work you two did.

24:28.842 --> 24:30.344
Cecil paid the price.

24:30.344 --> 24:32.721
No. That's crazy.

24:32.721 --> 24:34.264
I mean,

24:34.264 --> 24:37.601
has there been
an occasional unhappy customer?

24:37.601 --> 24:40.270
Yes, but no one
who would want to kill us.

24:40.270 --> 24:42.981
Excuse me. Uh, does this phone
look familiar?

24:42.981 --> 24:45.651
No. Why?
I found it

24:45.651 --> 24:47.653
in one of Cecil's drawers.

24:47.653 --> 24:50.197
I think it's a burner phone.
There's no call history,

24:50.197 --> 24:53.492
but there are some interesting
text messages in the outbox.

24:53.492 --> 24:56.578
"All's clear. Go now.
1620 Jesup Avenue.

24:56.578 --> 24:58.247
53-86-29-04."

24:58.247 --> 25:01.250
Sent on the same day he died.

25:01.250 --> 25:04.670
You got any idea
what's at 1620 Jesup?

25:04.670 --> 25:06.839
No.

25:06.839 --> 25:09.842
Do you think it has something
to do with what happened to him?

25:13.554 --> 25:16.348
Police.

25:16.348 --> 25:18.559
Anyone in here?

25:27.985 --> 25:29.903
It's all clear.

25:34.867 --> 25:37.286
Look at this.

25:39.371 --> 25:40.956
WATSON:
Oh.

25:40.956 --> 25:42.207
Those numbers

25:42.207 --> 25:44.251
on Cecil Troy's last text.

25:44.251 --> 25:46.545
They had to have been
the combination, right?

25:46.545 --> 25:49.339
This footprint
is Ridley Dineen's.

25:49.339 --> 25:52.050
I recognize the tread
from his boots.

25:52.050 --> 25:54.595
So this must be the
stash house he ripped off.

25:54.595 --> 25:56.805
And Cecil Troy was the one
who sent him here.

26:04.646 --> 26:05.856
(footfalls approaching)

26:05.856 --> 26:07.357
HOLMES:
Have you forgotten my new
color-coding system already?

26:07.357 --> 26:09.193
Red lines indicate ownership.

26:09.193 --> 26:10.861
Blue is a familial relationship.

26:10.861 --> 26:12.237
Green denotes
a financial connection.

26:12.237 --> 26:13.447
Pink is for kissing cousins.

26:13.447 --> 26:16.450
Purple means
two suspects sang karaoke duets.

26:16.450 --> 26:18.243
You mock me?

26:18.243 --> 26:20.412
So, Cecil Troy didn't just send
Ridley Dineen

26:20.412 --> 26:21.872
to rob that stash house.

26:21.872 --> 26:23.415
He owned the place.

26:23.415 --> 26:25.042
His uncle died a month
ago and left it to him.

26:25.042 --> 26:26.543
Marcus checked.

26:26.543 --> 26:28.045
The estate is still in probate,

26:28.045 --> 26:31.632
but Cecil already had the keys.
Red.

26:31.632 --> 26:33.675
You would think there were
easier ways to fetch drug money

26:33.675 --> 26:36.011
if you have the keys
to the stash house

26:36.011 --> 26:38.305
and the combination to the safe
that the money is kept in.

26:38.305 --> 26:41.308
Well, obviously, Cecil was part
of the plot to kill Dineen,

26:41.308 --> 26:45.062
but I just can't figure out why
and how he even knew the guy.

26:45.062 --> 26:47.606
What would you believe? They
played together as children?

26:47.606 --> 26:49.650
I ran background checks
on the both of them.

26:49.650 --> 26:51.568
Turns out they grew up
on the same block.

26:51.568 --> 26:53.487
That can't be a coincidence.

26:53.487 --> 26:56.865
And then, 25 years later,
Cecil sets Ridley up to die.

26:56.865 --> 26:59.660
Tells him about a stash house
full of cash.

26:59.660 --> 27:01.286
Dineen is only too happy
to take the money,

27:01.286 --> 27:02.496
and then,
either because he had tipped

27:02.496 --> 27:04.164
to his
old friend's bad intentions...

27:04.164 --> 27:06.917
Or he just didn't feel
like splitting the proceeds.

27:06.917 --> 27:09.419
He drives to Cecil's house
and shoots him dead,

27:09.419 --> 27:11.004
not more than an hour

27:11.004 --> 27:14.299
before he himself inhales
a lungful of Kolokol-1.

27:14.299 --> 27:17.386
What are the odds we're looking
at a closed loop?

27:17.386 --> 27:19.012
Each guy had something
against the other.

27:19.012 --> 27:20.681
They kill each other.
End of story.

27:20.681 --> 27:22.307
It's possible,

27:22.307 --> 27:25.769
but we still don't know
where Cecil got that money.

27:25.769 --> 27:28.772
His bank records show
no unusual activity.

27:28.772 --> 27:30.440
And he killed Dineen
with a substance

27:30.440 --> 27:32.484
I hadn't previously imagined
existing on this continent.

27:32.484 --> 27:35.529
Well, Cecil was a chemist.

27:35.529 --> 27:37.239
Maybe he's the one
who made the Kolokol-1.

27:37.239 --> 27:39.199
Mm. I still like the Russians.

27:39.199 --> 27:41.201
If I'm wrong about them,
I should know soon enough.

27:41.201 --> 27:43.078
I'm supposed to meet Olga
Berezhnaya in 20 minutes.

27:52.421 --> 27:54.464
You know, that's one thing
I appreciate about

27:54.464 --> 27:56.842
people in your profession--
punctuality.

27:56.842 --> 27:59.136
I never met a spy
who didn't arrive on time.

27:59.136 --> 28:01.263
Old habits die hard.

28:01.263 --> 28:02.806
This is a strange spot

28:02.806 --> 28:04.808
for a clandestine meeting,
though, isn't it?

28:04.808 --> 28:06.560
We're two blocks
from a police station,

28:06.560 --> 28:08.729
and in plain view
of a thousand windows.

28:08.729 --> 28:10.480
Rest assured,
I didn't choose this spot

28:10.480 --> 28:12.566
for their charcuterie plate.

28:12.566 --> 28:14.526
It is really good, though.
You should try some.

28:14.526 --> 28:16.528
I think I'd prefer that dossier.

28:16.528 --> 28:18.989
A summary first.

28:18.989 --> 28:22.492
Cecil Troy has no connection
with Russian intelligence.

28:22.492 --> 28:24.328
No disrespect, but isn't that
what you would say

28:24.328 --> 28:26.455
even if he was the new head
of the SVR?

28:26.455 --> 28:27.539
Why should I believe you?

28:27.539 --> 28:29.750
I don't care if you do.

28:29.750 --> 28:31.585
But I think you'll leave here
and ask yourself,

28:31.585 --> 28:34.922
why would I lie about that,
then give information

28:34.922 --> 28:38.258
that is far more damning
to my government?

28:38.258 --> 28:39.968
You see that window
on the third floor?

28:41.720 --> 28:43.472
That's the home of Pasha Voynov.

28:43.472 --> 28:46.975
Should I know that name?

28:46.975 --> 28:48.977
Mr. Voynov was formerly

28:48.977 --> 28:51.355
a chemical weapons scientist
in Russia.

28:51.355 --> 28:53.398
He emigrated to New York

28:53.398 --> 28:56.109
not long after
the Dubrovka Theater tragedy.

28:56.109 --> 28:58.946
Is he one of the scientists
who helped develop Kolokol-1?

28:58.946 --> 29:01.823
He was,
and so, even after he left,

29:01.823 --> 29:04.117
Russian intelligence
kept eyes on him.

29:04.117 --> 29:07.287
As it turns out, they fear
he may have recently

29:07.287 --> 29:09.539
cooked up a batch
of the stuff in New York.

29:09.539 --> 29:12.584
They fear. They don't know?

29:12.584 --> 29:15.921
He purchased
the requisite supplies.

29:15.921 --> 29:18.674
But my handlers want me
to make it clear.

29:18.674 --> 29:20.467
We have no
further information

29:20.467 --> 29:22.177
as to why
he synthesized the drug

29:22.177 --> 29:24.012
or who else
may have been involved.

29:24.012 --> 29:28.058
So why are your handlers being
so forthcoming?

29:28.058 --> 29:31.311
The knowledge this man possesses
makes him very dangerous.

29:31.311 --> 29:33.605
He's as much a threat
to the motherland

29:33.605 --> 29:35.273
as he is to this country.

29:37.109 --> 29:38.860
You just signaled someone.

29:38.860 --> 29:41.196
I'm sorry,

29:41.196 --> 29:42.906
but we can't have Voynov sharing
what he knows

29:42.906 --> 29:44.866
with the American government.

29:44.866 --> 29:46.868
(crowd screaming)

29:46.868 --> 29:48.662
(car alarms sounding)

29:48.662 --> 29:50.622
(indistinct chatter)

29:50.622 --> 29:51.790
MAN:
You guys should back up.

29:54.876 --> 29:57.879
For what it's worth,
it wasn't my call.

30:01.425 --> 30:02.592
MAN 2:
Call 911.

30:02.592 --> 30:03.677
MAN 3:
Yeah.

30:08.306 --> 30:10.892
What's all this?

30:10.892 --> 30:13.770
Everything I've got
on the Navarro case.

30:13.770 --> 30:15.939
Marcus offered to take it
off my hands when I leave,

30:15.939 --> 30:17.566
so I thought
I'd walk him through it.

30:19.443 --> 30:21.445
Course, if you'd rather
have someone else on it,

30:21.445 --> 30:22.904
that's totally your call.

30:22.904 --> 30:25.032
No, it's not that.
It's, uh...

30:27.534 --> 30:29.536
Can we talk?

30:29.536 --> 30:32.164
Of course.

30:34.416 --> 30:36.710
(sighs)

30:36.710 --> 30:39.463
Your decision to leave--

30:39.463 --> 30:44.176
does it have anything to
do with Captain Dwyer?

30:44.176 --> 30:48.388
'Cause if he did or said
something, please tell me

30:48.388 --> 30:50.932
so we can bring
it to the EEO.

30:50.932 --> 30:54.061
Whatever it was, I don't want
it happening to anyone else.

30:54.061 --> 30:56.563
(sighs)

30:56.563 --> 30:58.148
What?

30:59.357 --> 31:01.401
This... thing

31:01.401 --> 31:03.403
you think happened to me--

31:03.403 --> 31:06.281
we go to EEO,
do you honestly think

31:06.281 --> 31:08.658
it's not gonna happen
to anyone else?

31:08.658 --> 31:10.368
Dwyer'll be gone.

31:10.368 --> 31:12.245
I'm not talking
about him.

31:12.245 --> 31:14.790
I am talking
about all the others.

31:14.790 --> 31:16.750
Dwyer goes down,
do you really think

31:16.750 --> 31:18.627
that's gonna change anything,

31:18.627 --> 31:20.378
that this department's
gonna suddenly stop being

31:20.378 --> 31:21.546
a boys' club?

31:23.423 --> 31:26.426
To be clear,
you're not part of the problem.

31:26.426 --> 31:29.679
I meant everything
that I said the other day.

31:29.679 --> 31:31.848
The best boss I ever had.

31:31.848 --> 31:33.517
But I've been a cop

31:33.517 --> 31:35.310
for 17 years now.

31:35.310 --> 31:37.312
And in my experience,

31:37.312 --> 31:39.022
you are the exception,

31:39.022 --> 31:41.066
not the rule.

31:41.066 --> 31:42.818
The culture you're
talking about, Bree,

31:42.818 --> 31:45.695
there's only one
way to change it.

31:45.695 --> 31:47.989
Most of my friends right now,

31:47.989 --> 31:49.783
you know what they are?

31:49.783 --> 31:51.493
Cops.

31:51.493 --> 31:53.078
When I leave here,

31:53.078 --> 31:55.413
you know what most of my friends
will still be?

31:55.413 --> 31:57.332
Cops.

31:57.332 --> 31:59.751
You know what it's like
when someone goes after

31:59.751 --> 32:02.003
the department.

32:02.003 --> 32:05.215
The wagons get circled,
lines get drawn.

32:05.215 --> 32:07.008
And all that's gonna matter
to most cops

32:07.008 --> 32:09.094
is that I cost
another cop his job.

32:09.094 --> 32:10.762
And that's when
the crank calls'll start,

32:10.762 --> 32:12.764
the anonymous threats.

32:12.764 --> 32:15.016
Hell, I make the news, and then
people who aren't police

32:15.016 --> 32:16.852
can start weighing in.

32:16.852 --> 32:18.353
"Maybe she's just looking
for attention."

32:18.353 --> 32:20.814
"Maybe she
was asking for it."

32:22.315 --> 32:26.653
What happened between Dwyer
and me, I...

32:26.653 --> 32:28.697
I didn't have a choice.

32:29.781 --> 32:32.993
Now I do.

32:32.993 --> 32:35.829
I get it.

32:37.998 --> 32:40.458
I just wish
I had been here for you.

32:43.545 --> 32:45.255
(door opens)

32:45.255 --> 32:46.673
(door closes)

32:46.673 --> 32:48.592
WATSON:
I'm almost surprised

32:48.592 --> 32:51.011
that this guy's SVR file does
not include his day of death.

32:51.011 --> 32:52.262
I mean, obviously,
they knew it was coming.

32:52.262 --> 32:54.264
Obvious to you and me.

32:54.264 --> 32:56.600
Not so much
to the fire department.

32:56.600 --> 32:59.811
They seem to be swallowing
the idea that a faulty gas line

32:59.811 --> 33:01.646
was to blame for
the fatal explosion.

33:01.646 --> 33:03.356
You could correct them.

33:03.356 --> 33:04.733
I told the CIA instead.

33:04.733 --> 33:07.194
Spies are their domain.

33:07.194 --> 33:08.987
I'm just glad that
no one else was hurt.

33:08.987 --> 33:12.157
If Voynov was synthesizing
Kolokol-1 for Cecil Troy,

33:12.157 --> 33:15.994
then... his death is
hardly a tragedy, is it?

33:15.994 --> 33:18.121
Well, still, it would've been
nice to talk to the guy.

33:18.121 --> 33:20.498
We could have asked him
why he would cook up

33:20.498 --> 33:23.668
some chemical weapons
to help murder a thief.

33:23.668 --> 33:24.920
We could have asked him,

33:24.920 --> 33:25.670
but I don't think
he would have answered.

33:27.047 --> 33:28.548
Not if my theory about

33:28.548 --> 33:30.967
why he became
involved is correct.

33:34.095 --> 33:36.640
This is about a string
of robberies in Brighton Beach.

33:36.640 --> 33:38.975
Aka Bratva Beach.

33:38.975 --> 33:41.019
The businesses
that were robbed

33:41.019 --> 33:44.231
included two car washes,
a dry cleaner's, and a café.

33:44.231 --> 33:46.691
I think it's possible they were
all fronts for the Russian mob.

33:46.691 --> 33:48.985
Well, mobsters do love
their cash businesses.

33:48.985 --> 33:52.489
But what does this have
to do with Voynov?

33:52.489 --> 33:54.574
He left Russia without the
blessing of the government,

33:54.574 --> 33:56.326
which could be difficult
if you're one

33:56.326 --> 33:58.370
of their top chemical
weapons scientists.

33:58.370 --> 34:00.163
I submit he had help.

34:00.163 --> 34:01.831
The Bratva?

34:01.831 --> 34:03.500
They have the resources
to get him out of the country

34:03.500 --> 34:05.043
and keep him alive
all this time.

34:05.043 --> 34:06.461
Until today.

34:06.461 --> 34:09.631
So you think Dineen was the one
who ripped off these places,

34:09.631 --> 34:11.383
the Bratva figured it out,

34:11.383 --> 34:14.678
and then hired Voynov
to make some Kolokol-1 for them?

34:14.678 --> 34:16.471
I'm not the only one who thinks

34:16.471 --> 34:18.848
that they were the real
victims of this spree.

34:18.848 --> 34:20.642
Everything you're looking
at has been folded

34:20.642 --> 34:22.644
into an ongoing
DEA investigation

34:22.644 --> 34:24.813
into Russian drug trafficking.

34:24.813 --> 34:26.690
Okay, but the Bratva
is the Bratva.

34:26.690 --> 34:28.608
They're not shy
when it comes to killing people.

34:28.608 --> 34:30.443
So why go to all this trouble

34:30.443 --> 34:32.279
to make Dineen's death
look like an overdose?

34:32.279 --> 34:33.780
Perhaps slitting
people's throats

34:33.780 --> 34:35.532
becomes tiresome after a while.

34:35.532 --> 34:37.951
Well,
it's an interesting theory.

34:37.951 --> 34:41.329
But how does it account
for Cecil Troy?

34:41.329 --> 34:43.331
My interesting theory is
in its larval stage.

34:43.331 --> 34:44.708
It needs information to grow.

34:44.708 --> 34:46.334
So you and I

34:46.334 --> 34:49.045
are going to visit a
contact of mine at the DEA.

34:49.045 --> 34:50.964
With any luck, he can help us...

34:50.964 --> 34:53.425
weave Cecil Troy
into this bloody tapestry.

34:53.425 --> 34:54.092
(elevator bell dings)

34:59.431 --> 35:01.516
Anything?

35:01.516 --> 35:04.185
Uh, Agent Abanto's assistant
came out again

35:04.185 --> 35:06.646
to say he'd be
five more minutes.

35:06.646 --> 35:08.565
She seems to believe
him every time.

35:08.565 --> 35:11.026
She's either a phenomenal liar
or a bit stupid.

35:13.236 --> 35:14.738
Haven't got your lock picks
on you, have you?

35:14.738 --> 35:16.197
(groans)
Don't even think it.

35:16.197 --> 35:17.991
There's a file room over there.

35:17.991 --> 35:20.035
Could just pop in,

35:20.035 --> 35:22.537
look for the files
I need, pop out.

35:22.537 --> 35:25.290
If Ridley Dineen is responsible
for the robberies

35:25.290 --> 35:27.876
in Brighton Beach,
I'd be doing the Agency a favor.

35:30.462 --> 35:33.715
Is that a fascinating memo?
Actually, it is.

35:33.715 --> 35:36.843
It's about the DEA's new safety
protocols for the handling

35:36.843 --> 35:40.055
of all contraband seized
in drug raids, including cash.

35:40.055 --> 35:41.848
It's also the reason
we can stop

35:41.848 --> 35:43.850
waiting around for Agent Abanto.

35:43.850 --> 35:45.810
If I'm right, it not only

35:45.810 --> 35:47.812
explains who's responsible
for what happened

35:47.812 --> 35:49.939
to Ridley Dineen-- it also
explains why they did it.

35:58.782 --> 36:01.701
HOLMES:
How was the funeral?

36:01.701 --> 36:04.079
Cecil's funeral was
this morning, wasn't it?

36:04.079 --> 36:06.206
How did you get in here?

36:06.206 --> 36:08.541
BELL: Owner of the
building let us in.

36:08.541 --> 36:10.043
This helped.

36:11.169 --> 36:13.546
A warrant?

36:13.546 --> 36:15.173
We needed one
to search this place.

36:15.173 --> 36:16.508
Well, I-I don't understand.

36:16.508 --> 36:17.717
What were you looking for?

36:17.717 --> 36:19.594
Evidence.

36:19.594 --> 36:20.970
We know that
you and Cecil

36:20.970 --> 36:23.098
were behind
Ridley Dineen's death.

36:23.098 --> 36:25.225
That's crazy.

36:25.225 --> 36:26.935
It's worse than that.
It's cruel.

36:26.935 --> 36:29.229
I just came from burying
my best friend.

36:29.229 --> 36:30.772
BELL:
Trust us, if we could have,

36:30.772 --> 36:32.565
we would have come
for you sooner.

36:32.565 --> 36:35.151
Just took us a while to catch up
to what you two did.

36:35.151 --> 36:36.361
WATSON: In case you
haven't already seen it,

36:36.361 --> 36:38.363
this is a memo the DEA put out.

36:38.363 --> 36:40.365
It says that,
from this point forward,

36:40.365 --> 36:42.492
any and all
currency recovered

36:42.492 --> 36:44.494
from narcotics busts
will have to be cleaned

36:44.494 --> 36:46.454
by a company called
Troy-Kensit Labs.

36:46.454 --> 36:48.248
Your company.

36:48.248 --> 36:49.999
BELL: Last couple years,
there's been a lot of concern

36:49.999 --> 36:52.502
in law enforcement
that drug-laced cash

36:52.502 --> 36:55.046
could hurt or even kill
the people who touch it.

36:55.046 --> 36:56.589
Money
with fentanyl on it

36:56.589 --> 36:58.466
was supposed to be
especially dangerous.

36:58.466 --> 37:00.301
The DEA got so worried,

37:00.301 --> 37:02.512
they put out a solicitation
on a government website.

37:02.512 --> 37:04.931
They were looking for a vendor,
someone who could

37:04.931 --> 37:07.308
actually launder
seized money

37:07.308 --> 37:09.060
without damaging it.

37:09.060 --> 37:10.937
WATSON: Now, you and
Cecil won the bid.

37:10.937 --> 37:12.480
We're guessing,
when you already know how

37:12.480 --> 37:14.732
to safely clean textiles
that are hundreds

37:14.732 --> 37:15.984
of years old,

37:15.984 --> 37:17.986
money isn't much of a challenge.

37:17.986 --> 37:19.195
HOLMES:
Unfortunately, a number

37:19.195 --> 37:20.989
of toxicologists caught wind
of the solicitation

37:20.989 --> 37:22.907
and dismissed it as nonsense,

37:22.907 --> 37:24.868
a waste of
taxpayers' money.

37:24.868 --> 37:26.870
They insisted
that drugs like fentanyl

37:26.870 --> 37:28.705
could not be absorbed
through the skin.

37:28.705 --> 37:30.498
You had the bid,

37:30.498 --> 37:32.375
but the DEA decided
to slow everything down,

37:32.375 --> 37:34.335
do a little more research.

37:34.335 --> 37:36.337
That didn't work
for you and Cecil,

37:36.337 --> 37:39.340
so you came up with a way
to force their hand.

37:39.340 --> 37:40.967
He reached out
to Ridley Dineen

37:40.967 --> 37:43.219
and told him about a stash house
that he'd heard about.

37:43.219 --> 37:45.847
Dineen couldn't rob the place
fast enough.

37:45.847 --> 37:48.725
While he was out, you and Cecil
went to his apartment

37:48.725 --> 37:50.226
and tampered with his inhaler.

37:50.226 --> 37:51.603
WATSON: You knew that using it
would kill him

37:51.603 --> 37:52.687
in less than a minute.

37:52.687 --> 37:54.606
Police would process the scene
and assume

37:54.606 --> 37:57.400
that the fentanyl
in his system was from the cash.

37:57.400 --> 37:59.569
There would be more
panic about toxic money,

37:59.569 --> 38:01.821
and the DEA would finally close
their contract with you.

38:01.821 --> 38:03.323
What you didn't count on

38:03.323 --> 38:05.366
was Dineen killing Cecil
after he was done.

38:07.243 --> 38:09.078
I'm sorry,

38:09.078 --> 38:10.663
it sounds like you're talking
about things

38:10.663 --> 38:12.248
that Cecil may have done.

38:12.248 --> 38:14.209
If he did do them,

38:14.209 --> 38:16.127
I wouldn't know anything
about it.

38:16.127 --> 38:17.545
HOLMES:
Yeah, very smart.

38:17.545 --> 38:19.672
Blame the dead man
because he can't defend himself.

38:19.672 --> 38:22.425
However, we're confident
we're gonna be able to link you

38:22.425 --> 38:23.885
to your two other accomplices,

38:23.885 --> 38:25.428

and Lady Godiva.

38:27.013 --> 38:28.890
She's your cat, right?

38:28.890 --> 38:31.893
We got a court order
for a sample of her hair.

38:31.893 --> 38:33.478
We're gonna compare it
to the hair we found

38:33.478 --> 38:35.104
all over Dineen's apartment.

38:35.104 --> 38:36.648
WATSON: We're also gonna
take a close look

38:36.648 --> 38:37.941
at your bank records.

38:37.941 --> 38:39.692
Someone paid Voynov

38:39.692 --> 38:41.694
to synthesize the drug
that killed Dineen.

38:41.694 --> 38:44.113
Probably the same person
who came up with all the cash

38:44.113 --> 38:46.366
that Dineen took out
of that safe.

38:46.366 --> 38:47.951
We already know
it wasn't Cecil.

38:47.951 --> 38:49.494
So tell us,

38:49.494 --> 38:51.496
when we talk to your bank,
are we gonna find out

38:51.496 --> 38:54.123
that you recently withdrew
a couple hundred grand in cash?

38:55.917 --> 38:57.919
Yeah.

38:57.919 --> 39:00.755
That's what we thought.

39:15.979 --> 39:20.400
They were photos from a trip
I'd taken with my ex.

39:20.400 --> 39:22.151
I was in a bathing suit.

39:22.151 --> 39:24.404
He e-mailed them
to a few people,

39:24.404 --> 39:26.948
made a few comments.

You're asking a question that
Dwyer should've asked himself.

39:40.044 --> 39:42.463
I went to EEO today.

39:42.463 --> 39:44.465
Told 'em everything.

39:44.465 --> 39:46.134
I thought you said...

39:46.134 --> 39:47.885
I know what I said.

39:47.885 --> 39:50.388
And, for the record,
I don't think I was wrong

39:50.388 --> 39:52.140
for feeling the way I did.

39:52.140 --> 39:54.350
But... I don't know.

39:54.350 --> 39:56.102
Saying it out loud,

39:56.102 --> 39:57.979
I realized I can take it.

Before you ask,

40:00.565 --> 40:02.984
I am still putting

I really am excited
about this other job.

40:06.237 --> 40:08.948
I'm happy for you.

40:08.948 --> 40:11.451
Thank you.

you were talking about,
