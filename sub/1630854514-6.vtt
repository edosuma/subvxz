00:05.934 --> 00:08.770
GOSSIP GIRL
Episode 6

00:09.438 --> 00:10.898
Greetings, followers.

00:10.898 --> 00:15.026
From The Godfather
to Game of Thrones,

00:15.360 --> 00:20.116
one thing is certain.
Everybody loves a wedding.

00:20.574 --> 00:24.661
Whether it's in the hallowed halls
of St. George's Windsor,

00:24.661 --> 00:28.290
or the parking lot of a little
white chapel in Vegas,

00:28.290 --> 00:31.626
we just love to celebrate love.

00:31.626 --> 00:37.717
And when it comes to luck on the big
day don't forget the four essentials.

00:37.717 --> 00:42.429
Something old,
something new, something borrowed...

00:44.307 --> 00:47.852
- Three times has to be a record.
- Records are meant to be broken.

00:51.314 --> 00:53.648
- What's with the shopping spree ?
- It was comped.

00:55.025 --> 00:56.861
They asked me to be
a brand ambassador.

00:57.360 --> 00:59.989
Of course, they did. You must
get offers like that all the time.

01:00.698 --> 01:04.535
- No. Not since...
- That mess with your dad ?

01:05.494 --> 01:09.622
Which means that maybe,
finally, all of that is behind me.

01:10.499 --> 01:13.126
LVMH is gonna announce the new
partnership on Saturday

01:13.126 --> 01:16.589
while I'm at Max's dads' vow renewal.
I have a plus one.

01:17.340 --> 01:22.011
I want us to be public.
I do. It's just a little soon.

01:22.386 --> 01:23.429
Yeah, of course.

01:24.472 --> 01:28.142
Well, in the meantime,
maybe we could set a new record,

01:28.142 --> 01:29.434
Madam Ambassador ?

01:44.032 --> 01:47.744
And last, but in this case,
most definitely least,

01:48.578 --> 01:50.122
something blue.

01:50.122 --> 01:52.792
So, exchange those rings...

01:52.792 --> 01:55.794
...stomp those glasses
and dance the hora.

01:56.169 --> 01:58.089
Who knows what the night will bring ?

01:58.089 --> 02:01.466
From the patron saint of pansexuality
to Mr. Matrimony in a couple of weeks.

02:01.466 --> 02:02.635
What, are you, high ?

02:02.635 --> 02:05.137
You know what ?
I am actually surprisingly sober.

02:05.763 --> 02:07.181
You must be rubbing off on me, Hope.

02:07.555 --> 02:10.266
And not just in the way
that I usually prefer.

02:10.934 --> 02:13.770
Dad and Pops' vow renewal
at the Botanical Gardens,

02:13.770 --> 02:16.816
it's gonna make their actual wedding
look like a rehearsal.

02:16.816 --> 02:20.403
Wait till you see the tux and gown
that Keeks is designing.

02:20.403 --> 02:22.363
Once those pics hit New York Mag,

02:22.363 --> 02:24.656
Keek's re-branding
will officially launch.

02:24.656 --> 02:29.285
Oh, yeah. New York Mag ? Try top
feature in the Times vows section.

02:29.285 --> 02:33.456
Yeah. Oh, and I secured
the hottest wedding planner in the city.

02:33.456 --> 02:35.250
They are gonna make sure
that every last detail

02:35.250 --> 02:36.752
is perfectly executed

02:36.752 --> 02:40.506
so that my dads only have to think
about one thing. Love.

02:48.013 --> 02:49.265
Posted.

02:49.265 --> 02:53.019
Why can't we meet at school anymore ?
Bushwick is for Thai and coke only.

02:53.019 --> 02:57.856
Now that Mike knows...
thinks Jordan is Gossip Girl,

02:57.856 --> 03:00.192
the three of us really shouldn't
be seen together.

03:00.192 --> 03:03.194
It's been days and nothing.
I even still have my job.

03:03.779 --> 03:07.073
Waiting for the other Shubin
to drop is aggravating my IBS.

03:07.073 --> 03:11.286
I don't get it. What are he and his
mysterious benefactor waiting for ?

03:11.286 --> 03:16.041
Arrest warrants to process ?
What ? We're workshopping.

03:16.666 --> 03:21.505
Actually, my money is on a hit job.
Jor Jor stay ten feet away at all times.

03:22.381 --> 03:23.549
I can't die in this skirt.

03:24.215 --> 03:26.510
No matter what,
we should exercise caution.

03:26.510 --> 03:28.845
Maybe not post as much
for a few days ?

03:28.845 --> 03:31.932
Better to keep attention off
until we know what's what.

03:32.350 --> 03:35.645
Okay. Time to begin my nightly
looking over my shoulder

03:35.645 --> 03:37.563
every time someone moves
on the subway.

03:37.563 --> 03:38.646
Ladies first.

03:43.069 --> 03:44.027
Jordan.

03:46.614 --> 03:52.870
What you said to Mike about, you know,
your feelings for me was...

03:52.870 --> 03:55.122
Oh, God... you didn't think
I actually meant that, did you ?

03:55.538 --> 03:57.958
I would have said anything
to save us.

03:58.751 --> 04:00.251
Right. Of course.

04:01.962 --> 04:03.047
Thank you.

04:10.428 --> 04:14.599
Dad ? Julien ? Anyone ?

04:20.355 --> 04:21.898
WORKING LATE

04:35.662 --> 04:37.205
The power that that has.

04:38.248 --> 04:41.502
- Don't know why they didn't pick me.
- You're clearly a Chanel girl.

04:41.502 --> 04:43.587
With a fraction of the followers.

04:44.547 --> 04:47.382
I've been living under my dad's shadow
for so long,

04:47.382 --> 04:49.844
I never thought I was gonna get
another one of these opportunities.

04:49.844 --> 04:52.262
It feels so good
to be back in the spotlight.

04:52.680 --> 04:53.681
Do you like this baguette ?

04:54.222 --> 04:56.809
I can only be seen
wearing their accessories now.

04:57.393 --> 05:00.396
And will you be revealing
your other new accessory as well ?

05:00.396 --> 05:02.356
Who you clearly spent
all afternoon with,

05:02.356 --> 05:05.192
instead of letting me find something
to match that Papillion.

05:05.775 --> 05:08.612
Graham and I are taking it slow.
There's no need to rush anything.

05:10.865 --> 05:11.948
He said no.

05:12.366 --> 05:14.910
Cut him some slack.
He just left his wife.

05:14.910 --> 05:17.162
That's a lot to adjust to
before you're seen with someone new.

05:17.162 --> 05:19.956
Are you sure he left her ?
Isn't that like the go-to line

05:19.956 --> 05:22.084
every cheater says to their mistress ?

05:22.084 --> 05:24.253
Why would he lie ?
I hadn't even slept with him yet.

05:26.629 --> 05:30.925
Okay. Drinks on LVMH ?
This is a work event after all.

05:32.261 --> 05:33.679
New year, same naïveté ?

05:33.679 --> 05:36.557
That's why she's always had us.
You know what to do.

05:38.725 --> 05:40.560
So, you know how my mom
has been stonewalling me

05:40.560 --> 05:41.603
about the Jakarta building ?

05:41.936 --> 05:45.858
I think that I found a way to get
the project manager to speak to me.

05:46.192 --> 05:50.446
So, I know that my mom cut me off,
right ? But nobody else knows that.

05:50.905 --> 05:52.739
So, I left a message

05:53.323 --> 05:54.908
saying that I've been asked
to be their go- between

05:54.908 --> 05:56.952
and hopefully, she takes the bait.

05:56.952 --> 05:58.120
I knew you'd figure it out.

05:58.120 --> 06:00.665
Well, what can I say, man ?
You inspired it.

06:01.374 --> 06:03.750
I owe you. What do you wanna do ?

06:03.750 --> 06:06.378
Dinner at Stone Barns ?
A custom skateboard ? You name it.

06:07.254 --> 06:09.590
Big talk for someone
who no longer owns a black card.

06:10.716 --> 06:13.468
Ouch. All right, how about an IOU ?

06:13.468 --> 06:16.262
Cocktail hour
is from 4:00 to 4:40 sharp,

06:16.262 --> 06:19.308
so, Keeks must have the gown
and the tux ready.

06:19.308 --> 06:22.895
Jeanine Tesori,
scored custom processional music.

06:22.895 --> 06:25.314
That's gonna be at 4:41.
And then...

06:27.357 --> 06:30.235
That's odd.
It's the manager of the venue.

06:30.235 --> 06:31.737
Hey, Kathryn.

06:33.363 --> 06:37.618
Oh, I think there's been a mistake.
No, our coordinator is handling that.

06:40.955 --> 06:43.290
Of course, I understand, Kathryn, but...

06:44.833 --> 06:46.459
- What's happening ?
- Oh, nothing.

06:46.459 --> 06:48.920
Just notifying me
of our event's cancellation

06:48.920 --> 06:51.632
due to our failure to pay
for the back half of the deposit.

06:51.632 --> 06:53.550
Your coordinator forgot to pay ?

06:53.550 --> 06:57.971
Oh, no. That Judas didn't forget
anything. See ? Look.

06:57.971 --> 07:00.933
His company just announced
that he's coordinating a wedding

07:00.933 --> 07:02.809
this weekend at... Can you guess ?

07:03.227 --> 07:06.939
- Brooklyn Botanical Gardens.
- He played me for our venue.

07:08.190 --> 07:10.067
We don't have a venue.

07:10.067 --> 07:13.153
What are we gonna do ?
What am I gonna tell them ?

07:17.073 --> 07:18.951
Hi. Do you mind if we...
if we speak in English ?

07:18.951 --> 07:20.994
I don't know why your mother
needs me to speak to anyone.

07:21.578 --> 07:23.455
Uh, well... I think that she just

07:23.455 --> 07:26.207
she wants to make sure
that we're all still on the same page.

07:26.207 --> 07:28.502
If she really paid Tómas
to say, if asked,

07:28.502 --> 07:31.421
that he lied in his soil report,
we're good.

07:32.255 --> 07:35.383
But if she lied to me
and expects me to take the fall

07:35.383 --> 07:38.970
for accepting his doctoring as fact,
we are not on the same page, Otto.

07:38.970 --> 07:40.221
Well, did you sign your NDA ?

07:40.221 --> 07:42.266
Of course, I did. But I will break it.

07:42.766 --> 07:44.059
If she tries to destroy me,

07:44.059 --> 07:46.519
I will tell the world that she
was behind everything.

07:53.402 --> 07:55.320
Z ! I didn't know you were coming.

07:55.821 --> 07:58.157
Sorry I missed your call.
I've been so busy.

07:58.157 --> 08:00.117
Yeah, I know.
It seems like everybody has been lately.

08:00.117 --> 08:03.913
- Are you okay ?
- Actually, there was something that...

08:05.038 --> 08:07.123
It's Dacha from LVMH.
I have to take this.

08:07.123 --> 08:08.793
- Yeah.
- Okay.

08:08.793 --> 08:10.251
- Can you ?
- Yeah.

08:15.715 --> 08:16.716
Here.

08:21.596 --> 08:23.431
- Hey.
- Who cares ?

08:24.933 --> 08:27.185
I told you there was stuff
in your requests.

08:27.185 --> 08:29.729
Look. They're offering you
a partnership.

08:30.146 --> 08:33.525
Mango ? They'd offer that a partnership,
they're so desperate.

08:33.525 --> 08:35.944
I told you,
I can't reach the next level.

08:36.403 --> 08:37.570
Okay.

08:38.781 --> 08:40.282
Wait. Who is this ?

08:40.908 --> 08:44.370
- Do you know this person ?
- BillyEyelash169 ? That's a bot.

08:46.413 --> 08:50.333
Well, this bot says they saw
a sex tape starring you.

08:50.333 --> 08:53.379
- Did you go to Philly last Friday ?
- God, no, of course, not.

08:53.379 --> 08:55.256
Besides, I've always said
that I'm gonna drop my tape

08:55.256 --> 08:58.800
right before graduation to give me
a little pop going into college.

08:58.800 --> 09:00.302
That's a catfish.

09:00.720 --> 09:02.805
"My friend, Drew, says you were great."

09:02.805 --> 09:05.348
"I was wondering
if I could come up and hang ?"

09:05.724 --> 09:08.519
- Pretty detailed bot.
- Fine.

09:08.519 --> 09:10.604
I'll bite and see what this is about.

09:13.607 --> 09:17.360
- LVMH cancelled the ambassadorship.
- What ? Why ?

09:17.778 --> 09:19.613
They said that something new
came to light

09:19.613 --> 09:22.532
that constitutes an ethical violation
for the brand.

09:22.532 --> 09:24.827
Fuck. GG travels fast.

09:26.703 --> 09:27.996
What did you do ?

09:27.996 --> 09:32.001
I may have sent in a tip to try
to get Graham to publicly commit.

09:32.001 --> 09:33.669
She posted five minutes ago.

09:34.294 --> 09:40.718
This just in. We hear JC snagged
something before it hit the market.

09:40.718 --> 09:44.429
A certain Mr. who still has his Mrs.

09:44.930 --> 09:47.767
Or maybe I'm Miss Informed ?

09:48.099 --> 09:52.313
With her own home in shambles,
is she wrecking someone else's ?

09:52.313 --> 09:53.356
This can't be it.

09:53.855 --> 09:55.231
Is this what I think it is ?

10:00.029 --> 10:01.322
Oh, my God.

10:03.573 --> 10:05.325
I think I found out what it is.

10:06.285 --> 10:07.494
This isn't over.

10:10.456 --> 10:13.875
GG's been hacked. Someone just
posted and it wasn't me or Wendy.

10:14.210 --> 10:15.670
It was me.

10:16.127 --> 10:18.297
What happened to staying quiet ?

10:18.631 --> 10:21.133
If this is ending soon,
we have limited time left

10:21.133 --> 10:23.886
to make a difference.
I got a tip I couldn't ignore.

10:23.886 --> 10:27.264
Or since you're off the hook,
you went back to business as usual ?

10:27.264 --> 10:29.600
Jordan, nothing is gonna happen.

10:29.600 --> 10:31.686
If it were,
it would have happened already.

10:32.061 --> 10:33.896
You can't live in fear.

10:33.896 --> 10:39.110
On the subject of fear.
Now might be a good time to admit

10:39.110 --> 10:41.362
- I do have feelings for you.
- What are you doing ? Stop, stop !

10:41.362 --> 10:42.570
Let me go!

10:42.570 --> 10:44.656
This is me, all my cards on the table

10:44.656 --> 10:47.994
wondering if you could ever feel
the same way about...

10:47.994 --> 10:49.036
Let me out !

10:50.329 --> 10:51.622
Kate, are you there ?

10:55.418 --> 10:58.045
Well, I tried to get them
to undo the error to no avail, so,

10:58.421 --> 11:00.797
my dads are gonna have to postpone
and it's all my fault.

11:00.797 --> 11:03.217
It is not your fault, okay ?

11:03.217 --> 11:05.344
And postponing wouldn't be
the worst thing in the world.

11:05.344 --> 11:07.095
I mean, it'll give you more time
to make it perfect.

11:07.095 --> 11:10.016
This is what happens, okay ?
First, it's postponed,

11:10.016 --> 11:12.058
then it falls off the calendar completely,

11:12.058 --> 11:13.727
and then they never get back
together again.

11:13.727 --> 11:17.355
And any waning belief I have left
in love dies with them.

11:17.355 --> 11:19.733
Okay, okay. I see we're spiraling.

11:19.733 --> 11:22.318
I'm sure we can hustle up
another venue by lunch.

11:22.318 --> 11:23.821
People cancel their weddings
all the time.

11:23.821 --> 11:26.032
There's bound to be a last-min avail somewhere.

11:26.032 --> 11:30.202
You call the Carlyle and Pierre,
I will call the Frick and the Weylin.

11:30.535 --> 11:32.996
Roy and Gideon
will have their special day. I promise.

11:32.996 --> 11:34.248
- Okay ?
- Okay.

11:34.248 --> 11:35.958
Okay. Okay. Okay, bye.

11:38.460 --> 11:40.962
I just can't believe
that they would care about my love life.

11:41.297 --> 11:44.632
Maybe they found out that I gave away
the Neverfull Catogram in 2019.

11:44.632 --> 11:46.968
Oh, honey, you were right
to regift that.

11:46.968 --> 11:49.889
The only thing that changed between
them wanting you and dropping you

11:49.889 --> 11:51.806
is GG posting about your affair.

11:51.806 --> 11:55.977
- His marriage was already over.
- Said every mistress ever.

11:56.478 --> 11:58.898
I'm just not buying it, Lu.
It has to be something else.

11:58.898 --> 12:02.568
Maybe Graham has his own skeletons
in his closet that they found out about.

12:02.568 --> 12:05.154
And, no,
I'm not talking about all that Asos.

12:05.612 --> 12:07.697
An SOS indeed.

12:07.697 --> 12:10.784
Graham has been nothing
but honest with me from day one.

12:10.784 --> 12:14.704
It has to be something else, okay ?
It has to. I'll see you guys at lunch.

12:15.914 --> 12:17.124
What's up with her ?

12:17.124 --> 12:19.542
She's more delusional
than liberal Ye fans.

12:19.542 --> 12:22.380
I saw this happen with my parents
when my mom had affairs.

12:22.713 --> 12:25.423
Whoever this Graham person is,
he's lying to her.

12:27.384 --> 12:28.761
It's time to do some digging.

12:29.469 --> 12:31.388
Hey, speaking of digging,

12:31.388 --> 12:33.933
any advice
on how to damage control a sex tape

12:33.933 --> 12:35.684
that you never made
and haven't seen ?

12:36.185 --> 12:37.644
You sure it's not you ?

12:38.479 --> 12:39.729
There's a man in it.

12:39.729 --> 12:42.191
Well, you need to find out
why someone used your name

12:42.191 --> 12:44.567
in order to clear it
before Vivid has you listed

12:44.567 --> 12:47.320
between a Hogan and a Hilton.

12:48.406 --> 12:49.781
Couldn't help overhearing.

12:50.992 --> 12:53.159
But I think it is so terrible

12:53.159 --> 12:56.413
that someone is sharing
a sex tape of you without your consent.

12:56.413 --> 12:59.541
I think you should find them
and make them apologize.

12:59.541 --> 13:02.711
Apologize ? No.
I want complete destruction.

13:02.711 --> 13:06.257
And you'll get that. But first,
make sure the video is deleted.

13:06.715 --> 13:09.510
Take it from someone who's had
a video come back to haunt them.

13:10.302 --> 13:14.890
- Hmm. Fire starter makes a valid point.
- I can help.

13:14.890 --> 13:18.894
No. I'm not outsourcing, especially
not to a suburb like yourself.

13:19.437 --> 13:20.395
Lu ?

13:21.438 --> 13:24.315
Sorry. Slammed doing recon for Julien.

13:25.568 --> 13:26.651
Fine.

13:26.651 --> 13:30.614
Find the perpetrator, delete the video,
and make sure no one ever thinks

13:30.614 --> 13:32.824
that I've ever stepped foot in Philly.

13:32.824 --> 13:35.035
They're called
flyover states for a reason.

13:35.035 --> 13:36.495
Actually, Philadelphia isn't...

13:36.828 --> 13:39.540
Never mind. First thing I'm gonna need
is access to your Instagram

13:39.540 --> 13:41.083
so that I can triangulate...

13:41.083 --> 13:42.584
If you post, you die.

13:48.883 --> 13:50.593
At least now I know
what they did, right ?

13:50.593 --> 13:52.218
I just need to make sure
it gets out there.

13:52.218 --> 13:54.679
I need to find an outlet
that's out of their reach, you know ?

13:54.679 --> 13:56.931
Well, why don't you talk
to Gossip Girl ?

13:57.432 --> 13:59.977
After she sat on the last shit
I sent her ? No way.

14:01.603 --> 14:02.980
- Well...
- I might have an idea though.

14:05.608 --> 14:06.984
Have you seen Kate this morning ?

14:06.984 --> 14:10.695
Nope. She was a no-show
for her first class, which is unusual.

14:11.237 --> 14:13.115
But I'm willing to bet it's not unusual

14:13.115 --> 14:16.243
for women to hightail it after
you confess your feelings for them.

14:16.951 --> 14:19.622
Deeply regret sharing that I shared
that information with you.

14:19.622 --> 14:21.831
The one you should regret
sharing it with is Kate.

14:22.207 --> 14:25.710
No way she would miss work
just to ghost me. I'm calling her.

14:25.710 --> 14:28.338
- Stalker.
- To see if she's okay.

14:31.549 --> 14:33.719
You've reached the voicemail box
of Kate Keller.

14:33.719 --> 14:35.262
I can't come to the phone right now,

14:35.262 --> 14:37.765
but leave a message
and I will call you back.

14:44.271 --> 14:46.856
Hello ? Is someone there ?

14:46.856 --> 14:49.527
- Please don't hurt me.
- Relax.

14:49.527 --> 14:51.988
You're too small to hurt.
I prefer a fair fight.

14:56.283 --> 14:58.244
Georgina Sparks ?

14:59.245 --> 15:01.955
You know who I am ?
Well, of course you do.

15:02.330 --> 15:03.540
You're Gossip Girl.

15:04.416 --> 15:07.628
- I'm not.
- Save your breath. You'll need it.

15:07.961 --> 15:11.424
Coming off Sedivet
can be really, really rough.

15:12.090 --> 15:13.258
Water ?

15:20.766 --> 15:22.101
You kidnapped me.

15:23.476 --> 15:25.354
You never forget your first time.

15:25.354 --> 15:26.563
Why ?

15:27.565 --> 15:31.569
- I paid well for your identity.
- Mike.

15:31.569 --> 15:35.781
And now, he has enough capital
to finish his queer Tolstoy doc.

15:35.781 --> 15:38.283
He led me to Jordan,
but I knew it wasn't him.

15:38.283 --> 15:43.998
Too beta. I had to find his alpha.
You, a teacher, as GG.

15:44.539 --> 15:45.791
Much better than Dan.

15:46.124 --> 15:49.962
It never made sense how he could be
so many places at once.

15:49.962 --> 15:53.758
But you, so compact, so beige.

15:54.133 --> 15:55.800
Those forgettable features.

15:56.301 --> 15:59.221
I could never blend in
with this bone structure.

16:00.014 --> 16:02.265
Why is it getting all blurry again ?

16:02.265 --> 16:06.020
That water is ionized, alkaline,
and has Rohypnol.

16:06.478 --> 16:09.439
- I needed more time.
- For what ?

16:12.818 --> 16:15.070
I have big plans for you, Kate Keller.

16:17.280 --> 16:19.408
Even the fucking
Rainbow Room is booked.

16:19.408 --> 16:24.497
So that leaves the Constance gym or
Café Un Deux Trois in Times Square ?

16:24.954 --> 16:27.999
Dad needs their love
to be affirmed with champagne

16:27.999 --> 16:31.003
and couture and 200
of their closest friends.

16:31.003 --> 16:32.963
He will see the failure of that
as a bad omen,

16:32.963 --> 16:34.589
and you know what a Pisces he is.

16:34.589 --> 16:36.926
Hey, what do you think
about a non-traditional venue ?

16:36.926 --> 16:39.803
As long as it's not Carmine's, I'm in.
What do you have in mind ?

16:43.265 --> 16:44.850
- Status update.
- Yeah.

16:45.768 --> 16:49.438
Right. So, the guy that DM'd you
doesn't have the video. He just saw it.

16:49.438 --> 16:51.940
He claims the person that took the video
has the only copy.

16:51.940 --> 16:56.361
I found his name. Drew Pearson.
So, I say you go find him,

16:56.361 --> 16:58.114
do that terrifying Monet thing
that you do,

16:58.114 --> 17:00.031
and get him to delete the video of you.

17:00.031 --> 17:03.451
But, see, that video is not of me.

17:04.120 --> 17:07.205
It's of you posing as me.

17:07.997 --> 17:10.583
You thought I would let you DM
as me without keeping tabs ?

17:11.043 --> 17:13.546
I've been monitoring
every thought bubble,

17:13.546 --> 17:17.800
every nervous typo you've made,
including the message you deleted,

17:18.342 --> 17:22.595
where he said the girl in the video
had tattoos of dots

17:22.595 --> 17:23.806
on the back of her neck.

17:24.264 --> 17:27.267
You wanna tell me why you made
a sex tape in my name ?

17:28.019 --> 17:31.647
Oh. I mean, of course. If I had yours,
I would do the same thing.

17:32.189 --> 17:36.610
But something just tells me
that there's more to it than that.

17:37.778 --> 17:40.071
Okay. Fine. Yes.

17:41.657 --> 17:44.410
I slept with this guy, Drew,

17:44.410 --> 17:47.955
and it was my first time
and I felt really awful about it.

17:47.955 --> 17:49.498
I just wanted to put
the whole thing behind me,

17:49.498 --> 17:51.416
but I didn't know he was recording.

17:51.416 --> 17:54.002
The fact that he was makes everything
so much worse than it already was.

17:54.002 --> 17:56.213
Please, Monet,
you're the only one who can help.

17:57.422 --> 17:59.133
You're the only one who knows.

17:59.133 --> 18:02.803
You wanna be Monet de Haan so bad ?
Do what she would do.

18:02.803 --> 18:07.933
Figure it out on your own. Clear
my name or I'll destroy yours, okay ?

18:21.572 --> 18:23.448
Mr. Bergmann. You have two minutes.

18:23.866 --> 18:26.494
Hi. I was... I was hoping
that you would accept my apology

18:26.494 --> 18:28.245
if it came with a story
that you couldn't resist.

18:28.245 --> 18:31.039
Congrats on becoming deputy editor,
by the way.

18:31.039 --> 18:33.459
- Youngest in the magazine's history.
- I know, yes.

18:33.793 --> 18:37.171
- Your voicemail, if true...
- It is true, Miss Yuki. Yes, all of it.

18:37.545 --> 18:39.589
Your family paid an engineer
to say the soil

18:39.589 --> 18:43.259
for their Jakarta project was solid.
When the soil proved unsafe,

18:43.259 --> 18:45.929
they paid him even more
to say he did it on his own ?

18:46.347 --> 18:50.685
Yes. Yeah. That's right.
And now, he's taking the fall.

18:50.685 --> 18:53.520
That answers my question about why
you're turning on your own family.

18:53.520 --> 18:55.605
I can't stay silent anymore.

18:55.605 --> 18:56.898
Who is our duty to ?

18:57.817 --> 19:00.026
Billionaires like my parents who...
who don't care who they hurt

19:00.026 --> 19:04.364
or people who trust them,
whose lives they endanger daily ?

19:05.866 --> 19:08.284
Can you come up and meet
with our investigative team ?

19:09.036 --> 19:10.954
Right now ? Yeah.

19:12.789 --> 19:15.167
Sorry. Did you say venue change ?

19:15.167 --> 19:18.962
But the spray roses are already
on their way to the Botanical.

19:18.962 --> 19:21.465
No. Actually,
they just arrived at BAM.

19:21.840 --> 19:25.051
Yeah, there was a...
a bit of a miscommunication

19:25.051 --> 19:27.763
with the Garden,
but I've handled everything.

19:28.264 --> 19:30.015
The guests have been notified.

19:30.015 --> 19:32.308
And... and the musicians
have been rerouted.

19:32.308 --> 19:36.980
So, T-minus 16 hours until the most epic
vow renewal of all time.

19:36.980 --> 19:39.024
Why didn't you tell us
there was a problem ?

19:41.027 --> 19:42.777
Because I wanted everything
to be perfect.

19:42.777 --> 19:45.948
And, look, I know...
I know that BAM is not...

19:45.948 --> 19:48.199
But it is.
That's where we had our second date.

19:48.199 --> 19:51.036
- That Dutch Lear, it was awful.
- Oh, God.

19:51.036 --> 19:52.496
It was not as bad as the mahi-mahi

19:52.496 --> 19:54.748
that gave me food poisoning
across the street.

19:55.457 --> 19:58.794
But you stayed with me all night.
You held my hair back.

19:58.794 --> 20:00.296
I do not miss that ponytail.

20:00.296 --> 20:01.463
I do.

20:03.339 --> 20:05.467
Oh, who would have thought
that such a terrible night

20:05.467 --> 20:07.969
would be the start
of something incredibly special ?

20:08.387 --> 20:13.059
- Okay.
- Hey, Max, how did you land BAM ?

20:13.725 --> 20:17.437
Moving forward, our family trust is part
of the President's Circle till...

20:17.937 --> 20:20.065
What is it ? 2066.

20:21.400 --> 20:24.903
So, you do realize this will
all come out of your inheritance ?

20:26.697 --> 20:27.781
Yeah. Pops.

20:40.126 --> 20:42.797
Luna: Unsurprinsingly,
his haircuts cost 20 dollars.

20:46.049 --> 20:47.092
Hey.

20:49.345 --> 20:51.012
How you guys doing ?

20:53.848 --> 20:56.644
At least now we know
why LV pulled your ambassadorship.

20:57.436 --> 20:58.688
How do you know that's even her ?

20:59.104 --> 21:03.442
Does Graham usually whisper
into pregnant strangers' stomachs ?

21:06.237 --> 21:09.198
- Please tell me you're blocking him.
- I'll do you one better.

21:14.202 --> 21:15.495
Hey, I was just thinking about you.

21:16.247 --> 21:18.332
Hey, I missed you.
How was your day ?

21:18.915 --> 21:21.042
Played a fundraiser
at the National Arts Club.

21:21.042 --> 21:22.211
Dead as you'd expect.

21:22.712 --> 21:26.506
Did you do anything else ? Have
any fun pit stops on the way home ?

21:27.174 --> 21:28.384
Just thinking about you.

21:29.010 --> 21:30.052
Well, maybe I should come over ?

21:31.678 --> 21:34.014
- Tonight isn't great.
- Oh, that's too bad.

21:34.473 --> 21:35.516
How about tomorrow ?

21:35.516 --> 21:39.227
Now that Gossip Girl's outed us, any
chance you've had a change of heart,

21:39.227 --> 21:41.062
being my plus one
to the vow renewal ?

21:41.062 --> 21:42.397
Promise no posting ?

21:42.397 --> 21:45.943
All the cameras will be pointed
at the altar not me. I can guarantee it.

21:46.818 --> 21:49.864
Well, if you really
want me there, I'm there.

21:49.864 --> 21:51.239
I'll text you the address.

21:52.323 --> 21:54.452
Why didn't you call him out on his lie ?

21:54.452 --> 21:57.495
I need that ambassadorship,
and the only way to get it back

21:57.495 --> 22:00.123
is to prove to Louis Vuitton
that I would never date a married man,

22:00.458 --> 22:01.751
let alone a father-to-be.

22:02.459 --> 22:07.422
A live Stop the Story at the vow
renewal ? I've taught you well.

22:30.237 --> 22:33.574
Hey, Milo. It's Zoya. I need your help.

22:42.582 --> 22:44.209
Oh, good. You're awake.

22:44.709 --> 22:47.087
Did you enjoy your 24- hour nap ?

22:50.715 --> 22:52.593
What are you doing ?
Isn't this your house ?

22:53.593 --> 22:54.844
Brooklyn Heights ?

22:54.844 --> 22:57.972
I'd rather be back at Jesus camp
than be caught dead here.

22:57.972 --> 22:59.766
This is Dan and Serena's house.

22:59.766 --> 23:03.186
They fired their staff when they thought
someone was breaking in.

23:03.186 --> 23:04.647
Someone is.

23:04.647 --> 23:06.564
At first, they thought
it was the doorman,

23:06.564 --> 23:08.692
but when they kept coming home
to this...

23:11.236 --> 23:12.989
...they put up cameras everywhere.

23:13.405 --> 23:18.076
I had my son loop the image. So, now,
they're bringing in a paranormal expert.

23:18.076 --> 23:20.912
They have no idea I'm their poltergeist.

23:22.373 --> 23:25.459
- How long have you been doing this ?
- Five or six years.

23:26.084 --> 23:28.295
At first, it was small annoyances,

23:28.712 --> 23:31.757
taking a sock or two,
turning the heat down.

23:31.757 --> 23:33.801
But then I wanted a little more fun,

23:33.801 --> 23:36.553
like replacing the oat milk
with full dairy.

23:37.221 --> 23:40.515
Their kid's lactose intolerant.
They've seen every specialist

23:41.058 --> 23:42.600
and no one knows what's wrong.

23:42.977 --> 23:44.894
This is illegal.
I don't wanna be a part of it.

23:44.894 --> 23:48.149
Says the woman who built
a weapon of mass distraction,

23:48.482 --> 23:50.735
capable of controlling New York's elite

23:50.735 --> 23:53.362
in a way that puts the old Gossip Girl
to shame.

23:53.362 --> 23:56.198
- You really think it's better ?
- Well, I think it can be better.

23:56.782 --> 24:00.453
And I am going to need the highly
capable you for what I'm planning.

24:00.453 --> 24:01.912
I'm afraid to ask.

24:01.912 --> 24:05.707
Oh, no biggie, just destroying
Max Wolfe's parents' re- wedding.

24:05.707 --> 24:07.584
I'm not going to do that.

24:07.584 --> 24:10.670
Then it looks like I have no choice
but to turn you in to the police.

24:11.088 --> 24:14.759
Cyber stalking and bullying
carries up to three years in prison.

24:15.091 --> 24:20.597
Defamatory libel, another five years.
Criminal harassment, that's ten more.

24:21.223 --> 24:23.643
Looks like I own you from here
on out, KK.

24:24.559 --> 24:26.061
Let's fuck shit up.

24:41.327 --> 24:45.330
Inspired choice Maxie. It's over-the-top
but classic at the same time.

24:45.330 --> 24:48.041
- Sort of like us.
- Saskia sends her regrets.

24:48.041 --> 24:51.212
Somehow her flight
was rerouted to Saskatchewan.

24:51.212 --> 24:53.922
Now, let's get you both dressed
and ready backstage.

24:53.922 --> 24:56.258
Wait till you see
what I had Kiki design for you.

24:56.258 --> 24:58.260
Speaks volumes to our new beginning.

24:58.260 --> 25:02.223
I feel the same about what
I had her design for you, my love.

25:03.348 --> 25:05.518
- Let's go.
- Okay. Go, go, go, go, go.

25:07.560 --> 25:08.729
Whoa, I'm sorry.

25:10.231 --> 25:13.566
What is happening ?
These are clearly for a Bordeaux

25:14.025 --> 25:16.821
and not for our signature Burgundy.
I mean...

25:21.032 --> 25:22.659
Who have I become ?

25:22.659 --> 25:24.829
- A bridezilla, apparently.
- Listen, babe.

25:24.829 --> 25:26.956
You are just stressed
because you care, okay ?

25:26.956 --> 25:29.333
You've already handled the one thing
that goes wrong at every wedding.

25:29.333 --> 25:31.377
It's clear skies from here on out.

25:31.919 --> 25:34.170
This will be a day
your dads will never forget.

25:34.963 --> 25:36.005
Okay.

25:36.965 --> 25:38.049
Milo ?

25:38.049 --> 25:39.300
Have you spotted the target ?

25:39.719 --> 25:41.636
No, but he should arrive in a minute.

25:41.636 --> 25:44.514
And he wasn't suspicious about
a last-minute invite to a wedding ?

25:44.514 --> 25:47.475
No. Not after I told him
Amanda Gorman was doing a reading

25:47.475 --> 25:49.395
and that I would happily make
an introduction.

25:49.937 --> 25:51.104
And he just arrived.

25:51.104 --> 25:54.025
Good. Get his phone and I'll get you
off the top downloads of '22.

25:54.399 --> 25:56.110
Ulyana will make contact shortly.

25:56.110 --> 25:57.569
- Wait. Who ?
- Ulyana.

25:58.029 --> 25:59.154
You're not coming ?

25:59.154 --> 26:01.824
I'm afraid an unexpected wrinkle
prevents my attendance.

26:03.200 --> 26:07.413
I don't understand why we're doing this.
What do you have against Max's dads ?

26:07.413 --> 26:11.208
Can't you just switch their salt
and pepper grinders or something ?

26:11.208 --> 26:13.251
Ooh. That might be fun.

26:13.627 --> 26:17.757
I bet Roy does have high blood
pressure. But first...

26:21.885 --> 26:23.262
You have a whole list ?

26:24.055 --> 26:28.517
If I do all of this can I please go home
before anyone sees me ? I beg of you.

26:29.977 --> 26:32.188
Just do everything, and then we'll talk.

26:33.021 --> 26:35.857
And don't forget
to turn on the stage lights.

26:35.857 --> 26:39.277
And then you can find me
on the balcony for the coup de grace.

26:42.197 --> 26:43.366
Bye-bye, kitten.

26:50.081 --> 26:54.043
- Graham is on his way. And his wife ?
- Doing Gideon's hair as we speak.

26:54.417 --> 26:56.420
I thought that was just an excuse
to get her here.

26:56.420 --> 26:58.714
She's not actually doing Gideon's hair ?

26:58.714 --> 27:01.508
Well, she showed up with her kit.
What was I supposed to do ?

27:03.427 --> 27:04.387
There he is.

27:05.721 --> 27:06.764
Here we go.

27:10.517 --> 27:11.893
- Hey.
- Hey, you made it.

27:15.690 --> 27:17.942
- Bulking up for winter ?
- Oh. Hmm.

27:19.068 --> 27:21.904
I'm just not sure how long the rest
of my pocket money is gonna last.

27:22.362 --> 27:24.698
- Yeah, about that...
- Still no word from my mom.

27:25.448 --> 27:28.202
But I have an interview
with New York Magazine.

27:28.661 --> 27:30.120
First thing Monday. On the record too.

27:30.870 --> 27:33.874
As soon as that goes to print,
my parents can't hide anymore.

27:33.874 --> 27:36.584
Have you seen Audrey ?
I hate flying solo at these things.

27:37.003 --> 27:38.253
- Hey, Mom. Hi.
- Oh, hi.

27:38.629 --> 27:39.713
We may have a small problem.

27:40.088 --> 27:41.381
- Oh.
- Come on. Let's go.

27:41.757 --> 27:43.717
- Problem ? What problem ?
- Whatever.

27:48.514 --> 27:51.642
- What in God's name...
- Is this ?

27:51.642 --> 27:54.520
I was about to ask you.
A fucking tux ?

27:54.520 --> 27:58.107
Is this what Roy meant when he said
the look he created with you

27:58.107 --> 27:59.566
would
"Speak to our new beginning together" ?

27:59.566 --> 28:01.943
- Back to square fucking one ?
- No.

28:01.943 --> 28:05.280
No. I... I didn't make this for you.
I made you a gorgeous gown.

28:05.280 --> 28:06.656
I don't know who would make this.

28:06.656 --> 28:09.660
I bet that the dresser
accidentally switched

28:09.660 --> 28:11.996
Dad's outfit with Pop's.

28:11.996 --> 28:15.124
Well, I have three feet on Pop,
so this would be too short on him.

28:15.124 --> 28:16.375
I did not make that for Roy.

28:16.375 --> 28:21.254
You specifically requested
the two Toms with tails. This is Macy's!

28:21.254 --> 28:23.716
- I can't have that material on my skin.
- You know what ?

28:23.716 --> 28:26.344
I'll check the other dressing room.
I'm sure they're both in there.

28:26.344 --> 28:28.011
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Right ? Yeah. Yeah.

28:28.011 --> 28:31.639
Honey. Yeah. See ? Honey,
listen. Audrey is going to fix this,

28:31.639 --> 28:33.475
and everything is going
to go as planned.

28:33.475 --> 28:35.518
Are you trying to convince me
right now or you ?

28:35.518 --> 28:37.145
- Definitely me.
- No, but you're right.

28:37.645 --> 28:39.189
- It's all gonna be fine.
- Yeah.

28:39.189 --> 28:40.316
Oh, I'm so sorry.

28:40.316 --> 28:41.901
- No, no, no.
- That I assumed the worst.

28:42.317 --> 28:44.152
I think I just have pre-renewal jitters.

28:44.152 --> 28:46.155
- Yes. Of course.
- It's getting to me real bad.

28:46.529 --> 28:51.577
Oh, sweet mother of God.
What happened to my hair ?

28:51.577 --> 28:54.205
Please tell me
this is a work deep in progress.

28:54.205 --> 28:56.749
- You don't like it ?
- Do you ?

28:57.248 --> 29:01.462
I requested a 1920s bob. I did not
request Barbra in A Star Is Born.

29:01.836 --> 29:04.298
I went off of the reference
your assistant gave me.

29:04.298 --> 29:08.093
- My assistant ?
- Yeah. Small, really nervous, blonde.

29:10.888 --> 29:12.390
- I can fix it. I promise.
- Yeah, sweetheart.

29:12.390 --> 29:14.182
Do not come near me
with those hedge clippers.

29:18.396 --> 29:20.272
So, good news and bad news.

29:20.689 --> 29:22.732
The bad news
is that Kiki's designs are gone,

29:22.732 --> 29:24.694
vanished, and no one can find them.

29:24.694 --> 29:27.445
- Oh, my God. So...
- And the good news ?

29:27.445 --> 29:29.615
The good news is that I found
this in its place.

29:30.366 --> 29:32.325
That ? That's the good news ?

29:32.325 --> 29:35.787
I'm meant to walk down the aisle
looking like a Mormon bride ?

29:35.787 --> 29:36.956
I can fix this.

29:36.956 --> 29:38.957
I'm gonna cut the bias
and add some ruching.

29:38.957 --> 29:40.166
In 30 minutes ?

29:40.500 --> 29:43.545
Necessity is the mother of invention,
and, so, is mine.

29:43.545 --> 29:45.130
So, let's get to the costume shop.

29:48.718 --> 29:54.305
Dad, I am so sorry. I know
that this wasn't how it was meant to go.

29:54.305 --> 29:57.892
No, don't be silly.
Bad things always happen in threes.

29:57.892 --> 29:59.811
It's gotta be uphill from here.

29:59.811 --> 30:03.566
We are never, ever, ever
Getting back together...

30:03.566 --> 30:07.486
They were supposed to open with
Together Wherever We Go from Gypsy.

30:07.486 --> 30:08.946
Is that...

30:08.946 --> 30:10.238
... back together

30:10.238 --> 30:14.868
You go talk to your friends
Talk to my friends, talk to me

30:15.244 --> 30:17.203
But we are never ever, ever, ever...

30:17.203 --> 30:20.458
I can't believe they just pulled
the offer. They didn't say why ?

30:20.458 --> 30:24.128
Only that something recently came
to light that eliminated me.

30:24.128 --> 30:26.797
- Well, I say their loss.
- Enough about me.

30:26.797 --> 30:31.135
How's your separation ?
Things okay between you and Ashley ?

30:32.594 --> 30:35.930
It's been hard,
but being with you makes it easier.

30:40.185 --> 30:41.770
Another glass of champagne ?

30:42.979 --> 30:44.064
So good to see you !

30:47.818 --> 30:49.945
I know that look.
You're having second thoughts.

30:49.945 --> 30:51.697
What if we don't have the whole story ?

30:51.697 --> 30:54.783
Outing him in front of his pregnant wife
is a little extreme.

30:54.783 --> 31:00.538
Two words. "Pregnant. Wife."
Look, you're a good person, Jules,

31:00.538 --> 31:03.917
which is why you always try
to see the best in others.

31:03.917 --> 31:07.380
To your own detriment.
Case in point, your dad.

31:07.754 --> 31:13.094
It's high time we end centuries of women
giving men the benefit of the doubt.

31:13.678 --> 31:16.806
If not for you, do it for Ashley.

31:17.138 --> 31:20.726
You're right. We take this
Stop the Story live in five.

31:20.726 --> 31:22.686
You're doing the right thing, Boo.

31:24.397 --> 31:28.275
But we are never
Ever, ever, ever

31:28.692 --> 31:31.404
Getting back together

31:34.490 --> 31:35.740
Here you go, sir.

31:38.619 --> 31:43.124
Thanks again for the invite.
Amanda Gorman being here is insane.

31:44.541 --> 31:48.962
And a new poem from me,
as requested.

31:49.922 --> 31:52.758
Right. Wow.
She's gonna... she's gonna love it.

31:54.968 --> 31:57.846
Man, New Yorkers sure know
how to throw a party.

31:58.556 --> 32:00.558
I gotta take a snap to show my friends.

32:00.932 --> 32:03.518
Actually, there's a no phone policy
at this wedding,

32:03.518 --> 32:05.771
on account of all the celebrities here.

32:05.771 --> 32:09.524
- Seriously ?
- Yes. There's a whole phone concierge.

32:10.276 --> 32:12.320
You must have missed it.
Here, let me take your phone for you,

32:12.320 --> 32:14.237
and why don't you get us
some drinks while you wait ?

32:15.613 --> 32:17.325
Cool. Yeah, sure. Thanks.

32:26.041 --> 32:27.168
Ulyana ?

32:29.586 --> 32:30.838
Are you fucking kidding me ?

32:33.215 --> 32:34.591
I have some very not good news.

32:34.591 --> 32:37.636
I already found out that the doggie bag
I asked for is a non-starter.

32:38.470 --> 32:41.139
Well, my dad just offered
to buy New York Magazine.

32:41.139 --> 32:42.432
What ?

32:43.851 --> 32:46.061
My parents must have found out
that I went to Nelly Yuki.

32:46.061 --> 32:47.772
Now, they're trying to get
your dad to step in,

32:47.772 --> 32:49.731
buy New York Magazine,
and turn it into another one

32:49.731 --> 32:54.862
of his evil propaganda machines,
and bury the story forever.

32:55.279 --> 32:57.865
How much fucking money
does your dad actually have ?

32:57.865 --> 33:00.076
Well, Bezos once asked him for a loan.

33:00.076 --> 33:04.246
- My fucking mom, dude.
- Attention, everyone.

33:04.246 --> 33:07.583
Can we all please take
a moment to just enjoy this

33:07.583 --> 33:11.086
very special tribute
to my parents' love through the years ?

33:22.390 --> 33:23.556
Okay.

33:24.976 --> 33:27.687
Scratch that. If everyone can
actually just head to the auditorium,

33:27.687 --> 33:29.939
and we'll begin the ceremony shortly.

33:38.072 --> 33:40.741
Kate. You owe me an explanation.

33:41.450 --> 33:43.536
- Jordan, what are you...
- Doing here ?

33:43.536 --> 33:44.912
You've been MIA for two days,

33:44.912 --> 33:47.872
and then I see you in the background
of someone's story ?

33:47.872 --> 33:51.209
What I said was a lot, and it probably
should have been done in person,

33:51.209 --> 33:52.962
but I think you're running from this

33:52.962 --> 33:55.130
because you're scared
you feel the same way.

33:55.922 --> 33:58.092
And if I'm wrong, I need to hear it.

34:00.469 --> 34:01.512
Bitch.

34:02.054 --> 34:03.972
I don't feel the same way at all.

34:03.972 --> 34:07.142
I'm... I have to go right now.
I'm sorry.

34:11.397 --> 34:12.564
Well, is it gone ?

34:12.564 --> 34:15.775
Yes, but not on my account.
I remotely checked his desktop,

34:15.775 --> 34:17.445
combed his cloud.
Incinerated his phone.

34:17.445 --> 34:18.570
Incinerated ?

34:18.570 --> 34:21.824
I'm nothing if not thorough.
But I couldn't find your video anywhere.

34:21.824 --> 34:23.783
Well, maybe there's no video after all.

34:25.368 --> 34:26.411
You know about the video ?

34:28.914 --> 34:31.124
If you wanted to know about it,
you could've just asked, Monet.

34:34.086 --> 34:35.045
Oh.

34:36.838 --> 34:39.383
Okay. First of all,
my name is not Monet. I lied.

34:39.383 --> 34:41.342
And, yes, I know about the video
that you took of me

34:41.342 --> 34:43.428
that I did not consent to,
you little shit.

34:43.428 --> 34:45.221
Is that why you invited me here ?

34:45.221 --> 34:48.308
No. I invited you
because of your sparkling personality

34:48.308 --> 34:50.143
and ability with blank verse.

34:50.811 --> 34:53.229
- So, there's no Amanda Gorman ?
- Seriously ?

34:53.229 --> 34:56.399
The reason I invited you here
is because I wanted to erase that video.

34:57.400 --> 35:00.528
I wish I could erase the real act,
but since I can't...

35:00.528 --> 35:03.366
There is no video. I deleted it.

35:05.910 --> 35:08.370
The ceremony's about to start.
I think we should get to our seats.

35:08.370 --> 35:10.831
You're gonna wanna see this.
I'll explain later, okay ?

35:11.539 --> 35:13.000
Yeah. But first...

35:17.504 --> 35:19.674
Welcome to this evening's
Stop the Story.

35:19.674 --> 35:21.132
I'm here at BAM

35:21.132 --> 35:24.844
to witness the vow renewal
of Gideon Wolfe and Roy Sachs.

35:24.844 --> 35:27.138
But it seems my plus one,
Graham Smith,

35:27.138 --> 35:30.685
doesn't have the same respect
for the sanctity of marriage.

35:31.810 --> 35:34.771
- His own marriage to be exact.
- What's going on here ?

35:34.771 --> 35:38.401
I'm sure your pregnant wife, who you
are most certainly not separated from,

35:38.401 --> 35:39.818
would like to know as well.

35:39.818 --> 35:41.236
So, why don't you explain to her

35:41.236 --> 35:43.279
and my followers
why you've been cheating on her

35:43.279 --> 35:44.864
and lying to both of us ?

35:45.199 --> 35:47.702
I'm not his wife. I'm his sister.

35:51.246 --> 35:52.915
Wait. What ?

35:53.289 --> 35:56.794
And you're Julien Calloway.
What have you done, Graham ?

35:59.504 --> 36:02.008
Ladies and gentlemen,
please take your seats.

36:02.508 --> 36:04.427
The wedding is about to begin.

36:12.183 --> 36:15.021
See ? It all worked out in the end.

36:24.322 --> 36:26.614
What ? The chuppah is wilted.

36:26.614 --> 36:29.367
I told them to keep the lights down
until the ceremony.

36:29.784 --> 36:31.244
Roy, what is Sean doing here ?

36:31.244 --> 36:33.581
- What ? Who do you mean ?
- Your ex. Isn't that him ?

36:33.581 --> 36:35.291
And Mason and Edgar and John.

36:35.291 --> 36:38.002
All your exes are here.
It's like Grindr at a Quaker meeting.

36:38.002 --> 36:40.546
- Max, I... I don't understand.
- You didn't invite them ?

36:40.546 --> 36:44.133
Oh, no, no. My mistake. Must have
referenced an old contact list.

36:44.466 --> 36:48.929
And now, they're here to witness
what they could never be for you.

36:49.388 --> 36:50.555
True love.

36:50.555 --> 36:52.182
I suppose it wouldn't be a real wedding

36:52.182 --> 36:54.184
unless someone
in the audience felt regret.

36:54.184 --> 36:56.729
All that matters is
that you are both here

36:56.729 --> 36:59.357
to dedicate your love
to each other again.

36:59.857 --> 37:01.275
Nothing can get in the way.

37:02.401 --> 37:03.819
- What ?
- NYPD !

37:03.819 --> 37:05.236
- Max ?
- Nobody move !

37:05.236 --> 37:06.530
- Max.
- Police !

37:06.530 --> 37:09.366
Everyone stay where you are
and remain calm !

37:09.366 --> 37:12.286
We received a tip
about a drug deal in progress !

37:12.787 --> 37:13.913
What is going on ?

37:13.913 --> 37:15.038
Check that area !

37:15.038 --> 37:18.501
If I were you,
I wouldn't take a gift bag.

37:19.834 --> 37:21.378
- A what ?
- Check those bags.

37:21.378 --> 37:24.506
- Swiftly out the doors.
- You got the wrong guy.

37:25.048 --> 37:26.967
Remain calm everyone. Thank you.

37:27.468 --> 37:30.387
- This is a wedding.
- Fuck.

37:30.387 --> 37:33.348
- What is happening ?
- Max's dads didn't deserve this.

37:33.724 --> 37:35.685
This was just a test.

37:36.852 --> 37:37.895
And you passed.

37:39.604 --> 37:45.069
- We make a great team, you and I.
- Team ? That was not part of the deal.

37:45.653 --> 37:46.986
You and I are done.

37:48.113 --> 37:49.699
Officer, please let me explain.

37:50.490 --> 37:52.410
Proceed to the lobby, please.

37:54.744 --> 37:57.707
Okay. So, if you're his sister,
then where the hell is your wife ?

37:57.707 --> 37:59.709
- His wife ?
- Yes. His wife.

37:59.709 --> 38:01.084
He doesn't have a wife.

38:01.084 --> 38:03.921
- Sure, not now but...
- Not ever. I made it up.

38:04.422 --> 38:07.382
- I'm sorry. What ?
- I wanted revenge.

38:08.718 --> 38:11.804
- Revenge for what ?
- For me.

38:13.096 --> 38:15.598
I used to be a musician years ago.

38:16.766 --> 38:18.019
And your dad...

38:19.020 --> 38:21.312
Ashley couldn't afford
legal fees for a civil suit.

38:21.731 --> 38:22.856
But your dad ?

38:22.856 --> 38:25.401
All the best lawyers hammering
at her credibility,

38:25.401 --> 38:28.611
her lifestyle, trying to wear
her down. And they did.

38:28.611 --> 38:31.281
I have a baby
to plan for now, Graham.

38:31.740 --> 38:33.908
I can't keep fighting a losing battle.

38:33.908 --> 38:38.247
I thought she'd never get justice,
but then I saw you at that Deb Ball,

38:38.247 --> 38:40.749
and I couldn't stop thinking.
He gets away with it,

38:40.749 --> 38:43.835
and his kid's perfect life
gets to stay perfect.

38:44.670 --> 38:47.131
So, when we met at the coffee shop...

38:48.215 --> 38:52.386
I thought if I could get close to you,
I could find some way to hurt you.

38:52.719 --> 38:55.805
But then I realized
how much your dad hurt you, too.

38:57.807 --> 39:01.646
So, you made up some fake breakup
to your fake marriage

39:01.646 --> 39:03.773
so that you could keep dating me ?

39:05.148 --> 39:07.401
Do you see how fucked up that is ?

39:10.029 --> 39:11.739
I am so sorry about my dad.

39:11.739 --> 39:14.241
If I could send him
to jail myself, I would.

39:14.616 --> 39:19.329
You don't owe me an apology.
My brother owes you one.

39:23.291 --> 39:26.212
I never meant
for any of this to happen, truly.

39:27.170 --> 39:28.546
I'm sorry.

39:32.842 --> 39:35.887
Hey, in the aisle, this way.
Let's go, single file.

39:36.722 --> 39:38.182
What is it ? Just tell me.

39:38.182 --> 39:40.893
My spy at LVMH
finally got back to me.

39:40.893 --> 39:44.563
They found out that your income goes
directly to a conservatorship

39:44.563 --> 39:46.190
under your dad's name.

39:46.190 --> 39:49.318
They couldn't risk having the brand
have any association with him.

39:50.443 --> 39:53.697
- You didn't know about it ?
- No idea.

39:56.866 --> 39:58.119
Come here.

40:07.420 --> 40:10.131
- What ?
- I know taking that video was wrong.

40:10.464 --> 40:13.592
- And illegal, and morally corrupt.
- Okay. I know.

40:13.592 --> 40:15.135
I'm sorry.

40:16.887 --> 40:21.725
This isn't an excuse, but I'm not
the most popular guy at school.

40:21.725 --> 40:23.268
I'm shocked to hear that.

40:23.268 --> 40:27.273
There are a bunch of guys that shade
on me for being a virgin and worse.

40:27.939 --> 40:29.733
But then we connected,

40:30.066 --> 40:33.070
so I thought, you know,
as soon as we were gonna have sex,

40:33.070 --> 40:36.782
that these assholes at school
wouldn't believe it, so...

40:38.159 --> 40:41.494
- I turned on my camera right as...
- No need to elaborate. Thank you.

40:41.494 --> 40:44.205
I fucked up, big time. I know that.

40:45.416 --> 40:47.292
So, I deleted it. It's gone.

40:49.628 --> 40:51.921
So, is the experience of my first time.

40:51.921 --> 40:55.050
You took that from me,
and I can't get it back.

41:03.643 --> 41:05.728
- Hallo ?
- Wow, you, uh, you picked up.

41:05.728 --> 41:07.604
I guess, I wasn't expecting that.

41:08.064 --> 41:10.983
You are my son.
I will always answer your call,

41:11.816 --> 41:13.611
even when you betray me.

41:13.611 --> 41:16.155
What did you expect me to do ?
Just sit around and watch

41:16.155 --> 41:18.698
while you put people's lives
at risk, innocent people ?

41:19.157 --> 41:20.742
What am I going to do with you ?

41:20.742 --> 41:23.370
Aside from kick me out of my home
and cut me off ? I don't know.

41:23.370 --> 41:24.580
I guess. you could...

41:25.039 --> 41:27.582
you could arrange for my untimely death
to silence me.

41:28.500 --> 41:30.085
Don't be so sensational.

41:30.085 --> 41:31.879
No, look, this story will come out.

41:32.629 --> 41:35.757
Will they believe you though ?
I mean, now that you're cut off.

41:37.300 --> 41:39.136
You knew that I would do this, huh ?
You...

41:40.595 --> 41:42.681
Did you cut me off to discredit me ?

41:43.808 --> 41:46.142
You should have paid
far closer attention

41:46.142 --> 41:48.812
when Papa was teaching you
how to play chess, mein Schatz.

41:48.812 --> 41:51.607
You may be able to silence me,
but you can't silence Daniela.

41:58.738 --> 42:00.616
- Hello.
- Hi, Ms. Yuki.

42:00.616 --> 42:02.118
Yeah, please tell me that you found...

42:02.118 --> 42:04.787
I take it you didn't see
Daniela Sommer on CNN

42:04.787 --> 42:07.456
taking responsibility
for the Jakarta cover-up just now ?

42:07.456 --> 42:08.499
What ?

42:08.874 --> 42:10.709
It seems you were misinformed.

42:11.127 --> 42:13.671
As much as I would like to help,
there is no evidence

42:13.671 --> 42:16.882
to back up your claims,
Mr. Bergmann. I'm sorry.

42:23.680 --> 42:26.850
Well, I failed you both, colossally.

42:26.850 --> 42:30.438
Max, I am certainly
a fan of melodrama,

42:30.438 --> 42:33.732
and this lighting
is really perfect for it,

42:33.732 --> 42:35.817
but I think you're taking this
a little hard.

42:35.817 --> 42:38.154
No. No, I'm not. You don't get it.

42:39.113 --> 42:42.449
It's my fault that you guys split up
in the first place.

42:43.033 --> 42:45.618
I exposed things
that I didn't even understand.

42:46.202 --> 42:48.497
No, I... I broke you guys up.

42:48.497 --> 42:50.874
No. Things were broken
between us

42:50.874 --> 42:54.586
long before you, yes,
maybe carelessly intervened.

42:55.712 --> 42:58.424
We had to go through
what we went through

42:58.424 --> 43:02.302
to get here on this stage with you.

43:02.762 --> 43:06.390
We had to fall apart
to put our family back together again.

43:08.851 --> 43:12.896
- You know what we have to do, right ?
- I was thinking the same thing.

43:13.897 --> 43:16.983
Max, the show must go on.

43:18.152 --> 43:19.236
Let's go.

43:29.454 --> 43:33.666
- Dad, Pops, are you ready ?
- Never been readier.

43:37.963 --> 43:39.090
Vows ? Fuck.

43:39.090 --> 43:40.882
- Oh, they're in your coat.
- Oh, it's in your coat.

43:44.345 --> 43:45.513
Thank you.

44:00.652 --> 44:03.197
They look amazing.
I knew you had it in you.

44:04.782 --> 44:07.910
In Love's Labour's Lost,
Shakespeare wrote,

44:08.452 --> 44:11.330
"At Christmas, I no more desire a rose,

44:11.746 --> 44:13.915
than wish a snow
in May's new-fangled mirth,

44:14.791 --> 44:17.753
but like of each thing
that in season grows."

44:18.796 --> 44:23.050
Pops. Dad. This is your new season.

44:24.093 --> 44:28.471
At the end of the day,
love isn't about control.

44:29.389 --> 44:31.099
It's about letting go.

44:31.892 --> 44:36.187
It's about being true to who you are
and what you do.

44:36.939 --> 44:41.401
And, most importantly,
loving who you love.

44:53.496 --> 44:56.082
Please tell your sister that I'm sorry.

44:56.082 --> 44:57.835
I never should have involved her
in this.

44:58.294 --> 45:01.880
You only did it because I lied.
This isn't on you, okay ?

45:04.633 --> 45:07.345
Despite everything, I still like you.

45:08.094 --> 45:10.264
And I know even saying that just adds

45:10.264 --> 45:14.477
to an already enormous pile
of confusing bullshit, but...

45:14.477 --> 45:15.519
I feel the same way.

45:18.521 --> 45:19.898
It's too bad, isn't it ?

45:20.858 --> 45:24.194
That two people, against all odds,

45:24.194 --> 45:29.075
managed to meet in this city
and fall for one another but then...

45:29.075 --> 45:32.118
Have too much between them
to ever make it work ?

45:34.997 --> 45:37.083
I need to focus on my sister.

45:38.084 --> 45:41.212
Somehow, despite trying
to do my best for her,

45:42.254 --> 45:44.131
I managed to not be there
for her at all.

45:45.465 --> 45:47.259
I know exactly what you mean.

45:48.886 --> 45:50.096
Goodbye, Julien.

45:57.018 --> 46:02.190
If we truly love something,
we should be willing to let it go.

46:15.413 --> 46:16.580
Hello ?

46:16.580 --> 46:19.291
Apparently, Drew's school
wasn't thrilled to learn

46:19.291 --> 46:22.253
about his extracurricular passion
for videography

46:22.253 --> 46:24.005
and decided to expel him.

46:24.463 --> 46:26.882
My mom's lawyers have already
served him with an injunction.

46:26.882 --> 46:31.511
Wait, you did that for me ?
Even after I pretended to be you ?

46:31.845 --> 46:33.264
Oh, it's only natural
you wanna be me.

46:33.723 --> 46:37.100
And no one messes with a de Haan,
real or imaginary.

46:37.518 --> 46:39.853
Wow. Well,
thank you so much, really. I'm...

46:40.270 --> 46:43.190
It's an unexpected
but welcomed surprise.

46:43.190 --> 46:45.608
- No, really, I'm touched...
- You can stop there.

46:45.608 --> 46:47.527
I don't do feelings. Ew.

46:48.111 --> 46:49.070
Okay.

46:56.036 --> 46:56.995
Hey, you.

46:58.164 --> 47:02.043
- I feel we keep missing each other.
- Yeah. Yes, we do.

47:04.836 --> 47:06.254
What's up ? Are you okay ?

47:07.505 --> 47:09.842
Honestly ? Not really.

47:11.134 --> 47:14.262
This shit with my dad
keeps fucking with my life.

47:14.596 --> 47:18.601
As much as I wanna put it behind me,
I think I have to face the fact

47:18.601 --> 47:21.603
that it's gonna take a lot more time.

47:28.486 --> 47:32.239
What about you ? I feel like
we haven't talked in forever.

47:33.658 --> 47:36.911
Yeah, there is actually something
I've been wanting to tell you about.

47:37.286 --> 47:38.661
Hey.

47:39.372 --> 47:42.041
You know you can talk to me
about anything, right ?

47:45.001 --> 47:47.003
Okay.
Well, a few nights ago, Shan and I went

47:47.713 --> 47:51.174
to this party in Philly.
And while we were there...

47:51.592 --> 47:56.388
While also holding
those we love close at all costs.

47:57.306 --> 48:02.686
But, dear followers,
be careful not to grip too tightly.

48:02.686 --> 48:06.148
Minutes ago, local officials confirmed
the building's construction manager,

48:06.148 --> 48:08.316
Daniela Sommer,
has taken her own life.

48:08.316 --> 48:11.737
Sommer was a German national
and long-time employee of Bergmann...

48:16.241 --> 48:20.286
To Gossip Girl:
I think it's time we help each other.

48:24.457 --> 48:26.751
That's a lesson some never learn.

48:28.045 --> 48:31.840
Tightening their grip
around a promise that will never be.

48:31.840 --> 48:33.341
Jordan is resigning.
What did you do to him ?

48:33.341 --> 48:36.010
Which is the most
dangerous thing of all.

48:39.597 --> 48:41.475
LED lights ? Really ?

48:42.726 --> 48:46.605
Did you know
that you have four weak points of entry

48:46.605 --> 48:48.481
and a very pliable super ?

48:49.442 --> 48:53.070
- What are you doing here ?
- I'm here to talk about Gossip Girl.

48:53.070 --> 48:55.864
I still think you haven't
fully realized her potential.

48:56.198 --> 48:59.034
You said I created something
more powerful than ever before.

48:59.034 --> 49:01.661
Correction. I said you could.

49:02.120 --> 49:04.332
You need to do more
than just report stories.

49:04.789 --> 49:08.169
- You need to create them.
- That is not my mission statement.

49:08.169 --> 49:09.545
I thought you might say that,

49:10.296 --> 49:14.215
which is why I'm gonna help you learn
how to be a true agent of chaos.

49:14.215 --> 49:15.258
I don't want your help.

49:20.222 --> 49:21.766
Fine. I'll go.

49:23.391 --> 49:25.269
Don't worry, I didn't drink it.

49:34.111 --> 49:35.655
But until you change your mind...

49:36.446 --> 49:37.740
I'm Gossip.

49:38.073 --> 49:42.702
I'm not like those other teachers.
I don't sting, I burn.

49:50.001 --> 49:52.629
And I would think twice
about that superstore wine.

49:53.339 --> 49:57.677
Or maybe it was your toothpaste ?
Don't you love Russian roulette ?

49:59.386 --> 50:02.848
Because while being in control
may be an illusion,

50:03.640 --> 50:08.145
spinning out of it is very, very real.

50:09.105 --> 50:11.691
XOXO, Gossip Girl.

50:16.529 --> 50:19.197
End of episode 6
