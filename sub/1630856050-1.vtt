00:10.427 --> 00:14.640
The desire to go further
has been a part of the American dream

00:14.640 --> 00:17.142
since the founding of our great nation.

00:17.142 --> 00:21.313
We saw the impossible,
and we made it possible.

00:22.523 --> 00:27.194
But there are those few among us
who would try to pull us backwards.

00:27.194 --> 00:29.196
They underestimated us,

00:29.196 --> 00:32.741
- our resilience, our resolve...
- <i>Five, four,</i>

00:32.741 --> 00:35.953
- <i>three, two, one.</i>
- ...and our desire to look up at the heavens

00:35.953 --> 00:37.496
<i>and never look back.</i>

00:38.497 --> 00:40.249
<i>After one of the most sensational</i>

00:42.376 --> 00:44.211
<i>...called the Mars Seven Alliance.</i>

00:44.211 --> 00:47.089
<i>The agreement aims to end the competition

00:47.089 --> 00:49.299
<i>Helios loses its antitrust lawsuit</i>

00:49.299 --> 00:51.718
<i>brought by Exxon, Shell and Halliburton.</i>

00:51.718 --> 00:53.637
- <i>The companies claim...</i>
- Show me the money!

00:53.637 --> 00:56.974
<i>President Wilson
was sworn in, beginning her second term.</i>

00:56.974 --> 00:59.643

<i>Survivors of the mission
have safely made it back to Earth.</i>

01:12.281 --> 01:13.699

<i>Your lunar suite awaits.</i>

01:21.999 --> 01:25.335
<i>The first hotel has opened on the moon,

01:25.335 --> 01:27.671
<i>James Stevens

01:27.671 --> 01:30.674
<i>Stevens struck a plea bargain agreement
with prosecutors last year.</i>

<i>The ABC comedy</i> Ellen <i>has been renewed...</i>

02:00.662 --> 02:04.082
<i>The autobiography,

<i>describes how he saved Chrysler</i>

02:51.129 --> 02:54.466

<i>As we usher in a new decade,</i>

both on Earth and on Mars,

03:17.573 --> 03:21.618
is bringing a new sense of optimism
to the nations of the world.

<i>Happy Valley,</i> Ranger-1<i>.</i>

04:20.677 --> 04:25.140
Holding at 200 meters from XF Kronos
with good viewing conditions.

04:25.140 --> 04:27.434
And what a view it is.

04:28.143 --> 04:30.437
<i>Status report shows all green. No flags.</i>

04:30.437 --> 04:33.482

Commander, EVA teams
report stage and checklist complete.

04:37.694 --> 04:38.987
Kuznetsov's ready to go.

04:39.530 --> 04:42.866
Very well.
Disabled forward RCS thrusters for EVA.

04:42.866 --> 04:44.743
Let's just hope
this doesn't get to his head.

04:44.743 --> 04:47.162
I'm surprised he still fits his helmet.

04:49.122 --> 04:50.749
How are we doing out there, Grigory?

04:51.875 --> 04:55.879
The most beautiful thing I have ever seen.

04:55.879 --> 04:58.006
<i>Relax. Your wife might be listening.</i>

04:58.674 --> 04:59.883
<i>Let's just not forget</i>

04:59.883 --> 05:01.718
<i>that the only reason it's you out there
and not me</i>

05:01.718 --> 05:03.929
<i>is because of
those two goddamn queens you drew.</i>

05:03.929 --> 05:08.100
Yes. But by now, you must be
used to coming in second, Edward.

05:09.476 --> 05:11.854
Easy, Grigory.
Don't forget I'm sitting by the controls.

05:12.396 --> 05:14.648
<i>Must be nice to be XO of Happy Valley.</i>

05:14.648 --> 05:18.151

Commencing separation from <i>Ranger-1</i>.

05:52.686 --> 05:55.147
<i>Today, we all make history.</i>

05:57.316 --> 06:01.278
<i>For the first time,
man will set foot on an asteroid.</i>

06:02.613 --> 06:06.200
<i>A Soviet cosmonaut on an American ship,</i>

06:06.200 --> 06:09.286
<i>wearing a suit

<i>This is the fruit of our Mars alliance.</i>

06:27.012 --> 06:29.014
I couldn't agree with you more, Lenara.

06:30.015 --> 06:34.895
Today, along with
our partners in Moscow, Helios,

06:34.895 --> 06:37.397
as well as the rest of the M-7 nations,

06:38.148 --> 06:44.571
we take the next step
towards a self-sustaining Mars colony.

06:45.531 --> 06:49.284
After <i>Ranger-1</i> hauls
the Kronos asteroid into Mars orbit

06:49.284 --> 06:51.995
and we begin mining
its valuable resources,

06:51.995 --> 06:54.831
Happy Valley will only continue to grow.

06:55.582 --> 07:00.963
Today, we embrace the 21st century,
the beginning of a new era,

07:00.963 --> 07:04.424
and none of it would have been possible

07:06.051 --> 07:07.177
without all of you.

07:07.970 --> 07:11.390
The sacrifice,
the amazing work you've done here.

07:11.390 --> 07:13.851
Every single one of you.

07:14.810 --> 07:16.186
Even you, Dan.

07:18.605 --> 07:21.817
Well, Ms. Hughes, I suppose Lenara and I
should get out of your way

07:21.817 --> 07:23.110
and let you get back to work.

07:23.110 --> 07:24.528
Thank you, Administrator Hobson.

07:25.112 --> 07:27.656
All right, everyone.
Let's keep our eyes on the ball.

07:28.198 --> 07:32.077
Props, make sure that consumption numbers
are within the pre-flight estimates.

07:32.077 --> 07:33.787
Yeah, tracking pretty close, Flight.

07:33.787 --> 07:36.456
Thrust,
check on the D-spin thruster telemetry.

07:36.456 --> 07:37.791
Copy, Flight.

07:38.500 --> 07:42.880
Star City, Houston. What's the status
of the stability platform command?

07:43.589 --> 07:47.134
<i>Result:
Remote PMU link has been fully restored.</i>

07:48.135 --> 07:51.221
Flight, Colonel
Kuznetsov commencing EV1 departure.

07:51.221 --> 07:54.641
- <i>Kuz, you ready to make history?</i>
- <i>Always, my friend.</i>

Copy. Go to proceed.

08:28.675 --> 08:30.260
<i>Three meters to asteroid contact.</i>

08:55.827 --> 08:57.079
Contact.

13:09.248 --> 13:11.625
A little something extra today.

13:12.167 --> 13:13.544
No, thank you.

13:13.544 --> 13:16.505
You cannot say no,
these are straight out of the oven.

13:18.298 --> 13:19.591
Thank you.

13:39.194 --> 13:41.446
You need to stop complaining
all of the time.

13:41.446 --> 13:42.865
It's bad for your health.

13:42.865 --> 13:46.410
I am in good health.
What we need to worry about is Gorbachev.

13:47.744 --> 13:51.290
Another new tax,
and prices rising more every day.

13:51.290 --> 13:53.792
The Marked One thinks he's a Westerner.

13:53.792 --> 13:57.045
He should focus more on issues at home.

13:57.045 --> 13:59.756
If only you weren't too young to remember

13:59.756 --> 14:01.967
how bad it used to be,
you wouldn't complain

14:01.967 --> 14:04.887
about how good we have it today.

14:04.887 --> 14:07.347
And I have more than one paper
to sell now.

14:07.347 --> 14:09.725
Good morning, Artem.

14:09.725 --> 14:11.435
Hello, my dear.

14:12.936 --> 14:14.438
Well, thank you.

14:15.314 --> 14:17.482
- Until tomorrow.
- Goodbye.

15:40.065 --> 15:41.108
Daddy!

15:42.818 --> 15:46.071
Hey, baby girl. Give us a hug. Squeeze.

15:47.865 --> 15:48.866
Hey, Sar.

15:49.825 --> 15:53.620
Miles, what are you doing here?

15:53.620 --> 15:56.415
I know. I'm sorry. I just-- I'm in a rush.
I have an interview.

15:56.415 --> 15:59.710
Have you seen my good shirt?
I can't find it at my place anywhere.

16:00.502 --> 16:04.089
Look, it's probably in
one of the boxes out in the garage.

16:04.089 --> 16:05.340
You can go look if you want.

16:06.008 --> 16:07.342
- See you later?
- See you later.

16:07.342 --> 16:09.720
- See you, Sar.
- Bye.

16:22.399 --> 16:24.318
- Miles.
- Yeah.

16:26.195 --> 16:28.447
They said
you still haven't signed the papers.

16:28.447 --> 16:31.158
- Find the damn thing.
- Papers?

16:31.158 --> 16:33.327
No, my fucking shirt.

16:33.327 --> 16:36.288
Well, it's probably
in that box you're looking in.

16:36.872 --> 16:40.042
- Well, it's not.
- You said you'd sign 'em.

16:40.042 --> 16:42.044
No, I said I'd look at them.

16:44.004 --> 16:46.048
Mandy, I just need some time.

16:46.048 --> 16:48.133
If I can get this job,
I can make us flush again,

16:48.133 --> 16:51.303
take us right back to where we were.
You could move out of your dad's.

16:51.303 --> 16:53.138
We could rent a house
just like the one we had.

16:53.138 --> 16:54.223
Stop.

16:55.724 --> 16:59.853
It's not some switch you can just flip,
and suddenly everything's okay with us.

17:03.732 --> 17:05.817
Why can't I find this fucking shirt?

17:15.035 --> 17:17.621
Thanks. Thank you.

17:23.335 --> 17:24.670
So, what's this interview?

17:26.255 --> 17:27.422
You're not gonna believe it.

17:28.131 --> 17:30.467
Uh-oh. I know that look.

17:32.052 --> 17:34.179
- What look?
- Last time you had that look,

17:34.179 --> 17:37.015
we wound up on the hook for three grand
of Amway shampoo.

17:37.015 --> 17:39.059
First of all, that was not my fault.

17:39.059 --> 17:41.353
There was a downturn
in the personal care market.

17:41.353 --> 17:42.938
Second, it's not like that.

17:43.730 --> 17:46.108
You remember Cal from Bruce II?

17:46.108 --> 17:48.944
Ran into him this morning.
Guess where he's working.

17:55.909 --> 17:57.744
He's going to the moon?

17:57.744 --> 18:00.205
Says they're looking
for guys just like us,

18:00.205 --> 18:02.249
with offshore rig experience.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.001
Isn't that wild?

18:04.001 --> 18:06.587
I mean, I could be doing
something that I never even dreamed of.

18:06.587 --> 18:08.255
Could you imagine me on the moon?

18:08.255 --> 18:09.882
No, not really.

18:09.882 --> 18:12.050
Well, get used to it

18:12.050 --> 18:15.345
'cause apparently we're just what
they're looking for up there.

18:15.929 --> 18:20.475
Drilling, building out mine shafts,
big-scale construction projects.

18:20.475 --> 18:22.686
You haven't worked a rig in five years.

18:22.686 --> 18:26.148
Yeah. Well, Cal says it's a couple months
training, then it's four months on.

18:26.148 --> 18:27.941
Be just like me working on a platform.

18:30.694 --> 18:35.824
It's just-- Maybe you
shouldn't go getting your hopes up again.

18:36.867 --> 18:40.204
- You don't think I could get it?
- No, it's not that. It's...

18:42.247 --> 18:45.334
I've just seen how hard you take it
when things don't work out.

18:45.334 --> 18:47.085
It will work out.

18:47.085 --> 18:48.754
I can get this, Mandy.

18:51.423 --> 18:53.383
Well, not with all those wrinkles,
you can't.

18:54.009 --> 18:55.219
Shit.

18:55.219 --> 18:57.554
Just take it off. I'll get the iron.

19:08.690 --> 19:12.736
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

19:13.320 --> 19:17.074
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

19:17.658 --> 19:22.704
<i>Happy birthday, dear Avery</i>

19:23.413 --> 19:27.835
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

19:33.382 --> 19:35.384
Aunt Danielle,
can I have the piece with the castle?

19:35.384 --> 19:37.010
You got it, kid.

19:37.010 --> 19:38.846
Who else wants a slice?

19:38.846 --> 19:41.265
- Me!
- Me!

19:42.558 --> 19:44.810
Look at her, happy as a little clam.

19:45.394 --> 19:46.728
I bet.

19:46.728 --> 19:48.313
All that sugar she just had.

19:48.856 --> 19:50.274
Why do you think
I'm getting another slice?

20:00.492 --> 20:03.787
How you doing?
I know birthdays are always tough for me.

20:05.831 --> 20:08.166
I'm doing okay, you know?

20:08.166 --> 20:09.459
Every year gets a little easier.

20:11.295 --> 20:13.505
But thank you so much for coming.

20:14.131 --> 20:16.216
It means a lot to Avery and to me.

20:16.216 --> 20:18.468
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

20:22.014 --> 20:24.558
Avery, put that down.

20:25.726 --> 20:27.561
She's never gonna hear me in here.

20:28.270 --> 20:29.521
Avery!

20:51.835 --> 20:54.630
<i>I know you won't be here
for another two months,</i>

20:54.630 --> 20:57.466
<i>but we can't wait to
finally have you home.</i>

20:58.884 --> 21:02.638
<i>Your room is waiting for you.
Alex is really excited.</i>

21:04.473 --> 21:06.141
<i>Alex, wanna say hi to Poppy?</i>

21:06.141 --> 21:08.560
<i>Yeah. Hi, Poppy.</i>

21:10.354 --> 21:11.855
<i>Say hi to Ed, Olga.</i>

21:17.402 --> 21:21.156
<i>You better be coming back this time, Dad,
so I can send Alexei's mom back to Omsk.</i>

21:23.450 --> 21:26.161
<i>Anyway, I love you.</i>

21:26.954 --> 21:27.996
<i>Always.</i>

21:37.506 --> 21:39.049
<i>Commander Baldwin,</i>

21:39.049 --> 21:42.636
<i>Team One signals anchor
and cable harness install to commence.</i>

21:45.889 --> 21:48.058
Despin of asteroid complete.

21:48.684 --> 21:51.895
Proceeding with anchor
and cable harness installation.

21:56.316 --> 21:58.652
Approaching anchor site 36.

22:00.195 --> 22:03.156
Copy.
Cable tension looks good. I'm at site.

22:07.578 --> 22:09.788
We're gonna attach it to our cable.

22:09.788 --> 22:11.707
We've got a sister anchor installed.

22:14.918 --> 22:16.503
Inserting the anchor.

22:24.386 --> 22:26.763
I see a good seal
at the interface. Stand clear.

22:27.306 --> 22:28.891
- Clear.
- Firing.

22:31.393 --> 22:34.813
<i>Ranger,</i> Team One, anchor 36 installed.

22:35.606 --> 22:38.400
Proceeding with
cable connection at anchor 36.

22:40.944 --> 22:44.406
Cable connected.
Install procedure complete.

22:44.907 --> 22:46.742
Translate to site 37.

22:46.742 --> 22:48.827
<i>Roger, translate to site 37.</i>

22:49.953 --> 22:52.414
Truss element echo 42 is nearly complete.

22:53.290 --> 22:55.834
Two more bolts and we move on to echo 43.

22:56.335 --> 22:59.338
Proceeding with power connector 037.

23:00.005 --> 23:02.132
Engaging lockpins.

23:02.132 --> 23:05.969
Yeah, looking good here.
Proceed at green light. We have conduit.

23:05.969 --> 23:08.013
Here goes, with the PGT. Torquing bolt.

23:08.013 --> 23:12.476
One, two, three, four, five turns.

23:21.693 --> 23:24.696
I bet it feels so fucking great
flying around free like that.

23:25.739 --> 23:26.865
Screw-free.

23:27.741 --> 23:30.452
I prefer being hooked
to something nice and solid.

23:31.370 --> 23:32.704
Helios 2, Kuznetsov.

23:32.704 --> 23:34.790
Let's pick up the pace.

23:35.541 --> 23:36.750
Copy, Colonel.

23:37.835 --> 23:40.212
Comrade Stalin sure is feeling himself.

23:40.921 --> 23:43.757
No North Koreans around
to steal his thunder this time.

23:43.757 --> 23:46.510
He gets the glory and we do all the work.

23:46.510 --> 23:50.430
Yeah, he can have all the glory he wants,
as long as we get our bonus.

23:50.430 --> 23:53.267
Well, we won't get shit
if we don't finish this fucking thing.

<i>Translate to site 38.</i>

24:15.038 --> 24:16.790

24:18.709 --> 24:19.960
<i>Copy that, Team Two.</i>

24:21.962 --> 24:23.505
<i>Winch ops and work.</i>

24:27.593 --> 24:30.012
Hey, really nice you brought your kid in
for the big day.

24:30.762 --> 24:32.055
He's being a real shit.

24:32.598 --> 24:34.474
I'm sure he'd rather be
at home playing video games.

24:35.058 --> 24:38.270
Maybe now,
but he will remember this day forever.

24:38.270 --> 24:41.148
I still think about
the first time my dad took me to work

24:41.148 --> 24:42.983
to show me the assembly line.

24:43.609 --> 24:45.569
How everything works. Soup to nuts.

24:46.111 --> 24:49.364
And of course, I was more interested
in the vending machines.

24:51.825 --> 24:53.869
But it did instill something in me.

24:54.786 --> 24:57.623
You know, seeing my dad in his element.

24:58.290 --> 25:01.793
All those other men alongside him.
Making something together.

25:03.212 --> 25:04.630
Really gave me a sense of pride.

25:05.839 --> 25:09.426
And I got to skip school,
which was a double bonus.

25:10.010 --> 25:12.554
Yeah, I think that's
why he agreed to this.

25:12.554 --> 25:15.057
He'll come around. I did.

25:17.684 --> 25:22.439
Anyway, while they are lassoing this rock,
I have got my weekly budget meeting.

25:23.065 --> 25:25.859
And they say astronauts have all the fun.

25:28.237 --> 25:31.823
<i>Houston</i>, Ranger-1<i>,
we have an update on the RCS thruster.</i>

25:31.823 --> 25:33.450
<i>Standby for data downlink.</i>

25:34.409 --> 25:36.787
Copy that, <i>Ranger-1</i>. Standing by.

25:52.678 --> 25:56.348
Happy Valley, all of
the tether cables have been fully secured.

25:56.890 --> 26:00.561
Activating ion transport
engines at 20% power levels

26:00.561 --> 26:04.439
and commencing transport
of asteroid XF Kronos into Mars orbit.

26:05.440 --> 26:08.068
Everybody hang onto your butts.
Here we go.

26:26.753 --> 26:27.796
Holy shit.

26:30.174 --> 26:34.303
Ranger-1, <i>Happy Valley,
how's the acceleration profile looking?</i>

26:35.012 --> 26:37.389
Commander Peters,
accel curve right down the middle.

26:37.389 --> 26:38.515
<i>All nominal.</i>

27:07.961 --> 27:09.171
Thank you.

27:10.506 --> 27:12.466
Afternoon. I had an interview with--

27:12.466 --> 27:15.469
Fill out the application form
and bring it back to the desk. Thanks.

27:59.721 --> 28:01.181
Cal Harris speaks very highly of you.

28:02.057 --> 28:04.393
Said you're a guy
who knows his way around a rig.

28:04.977 --> 28:06.937
You two were derrick hands
on the Bruce II platform. That right?

28:06.937 --> 28:09.231
Yes, sir. I was nine years on that beast.

28:09.231 --> 28:10.524
Best years of my life.

28:10.524 --> 28:12.943
I've been getting a lot of
you offshore rig guys in here.

28:12.943 --> 28:18.156
Well, yeah, I'm not gonna lie, it was
a bit rough when the rigs all closed down.

28:19.032 --> 28:20.826
I'm hanging in there,
but something like this,

28:20.826 --> 28:24.413
getting to work on the moon,
that would be life-changing

28:24.413 --> 28:26.123
for me and my family.

28:32.212 --> 28:36.300
FSU, huh? Go 'Noles!

28:36.300 --> 28:39.428
Right, yeah. That's right. FSU. Yeah.

28:39.428 --> 28:41.430
Brother was class of '92.

28:41.430 --> 28:44.183
- You?
- '80-- '89.

28:44.183 --> 28:45.267
What dorm were you in?

28:46.143 --> 28:49.980
What dorm was I in? Well, Tom, I--

28:51.607 --> 28:54.484
What dorm wasn't I in?
You know what I mean?

28:54.484 --> 28:56.695
There's a lot of beautiful women
in Tallahassee.

28:56.695 --> 28:58.405
I hear that. Yeah.

29:00.240 --> 29:03.869
Well, Miles, you have the qualifications,
the experience,

29:03.869 --> 29:06.747
and with a little bit of space training,
clearly you can do the job.

29:06.747 --> 29:08.415
I'm happy to hear that, Tom.

29:08.415 --> 29:12.419
After our intensive training course,
we should have a slot for you to go up in...

29:13.212 --> 29:14.213
summer of '05.

29:15.422 --> 29:16.423
Two years?

29:17.674 --> 29:19.718
I'm sorry. It's the earliest slot we have.

29:19.718 --> 29:22.262
Folks from all over the world
are lining up to go.

29:22.262 --> 29:25.349
Especially with that <i>Moon Miners</i>
reality show being so popular.

29:26.225 --> 29:28.560
I'm sorry, I can't wait that long,
Mr. Gamon.

29:28.560 --> 29:30.145
I really need this.

29:30.938 --> 29:33.690
Is there anything that I could do?

29:34.316 --> 29:36.777
I mean, I can't lose my family.

29:37.277 --> 29:38.987
And this job, it would really...

29:40.113 --> 29:41.990
It'd make things right again, you know?
And...

29:48.830 --> 29:50.040
Sure am sorry, Miles,

29:50.040 --> 29:53.502
but there's really nothing I can do
to move you up the list at this point.

29:59.758 --> 30:00.968
Yeah, I understand.

30:13.230 --> 30:14.231
Unless...

30:15.858 --> 30:17.860
I could maybe squeeze you
onto a Mars crew sooner.

30:19.152 --> 30:20.237
Mars?

30:20.237 --> 30:22.865
It is a bigger commitment.
Two-year tour minimum.

30:23.615 --> 30:25.367
A lot of folks don't want to go up
that long,

30:25.367 --> 30:27.744
but that's why the upside's bigger too.

30:29.162 --> 30:30.956
Would you be interested in that?

30:40.465 --> 30:42.968
<i>We're seeing
fuel depletion rates within predictions.</i>

30:44.052 --> 30:45.596
<i>Harness holding nicely.</i>

30:45.596 --> 30:46.722
All systems nominal.

30:46.722 --> 30:48.557
<i>Vibration within tolerances.</i>

30:48.557 --> 30:50.767
<i>Cables all within stress margins.</i>

31:01.361 --> 31:03.488
<i>Cable tension warning.</i>

31:04.323 --> 31:07.326
I'm getting a high side
RCS thruster firing rate warning.

31:08.243 --> 31:11.705
I'm seeing the same.
RCS propellant quantities are falling.

31:11.705 --> 31:14.625
<i>Commander Baldwin,
we're getting the same readings back here.</i>

31:14.625 --> 31:16.877
<i>Looks like we're losing tension
in cable seven.</i>

31:16.877 --> 31:18.795
<i>It's causing some instability.</i>

31:31.058 --> 31:32.809
Still climbing.
Can you give us some slack?

31:32.809 --> 31:34.269
I'm trying.

31:34.269 --> 31:37.564
Happy Valley,
the asteroid has begun to wobble.

31:37.564 --> 31:39.733
I'm shutting down
ion transport engines now.

31:39.733 --> 31:41.652
<i>Copy that,</i> Ranger-1<i>. Standing by.</i>

31:41.652 --> 31:43.987
I'm gonna manually fire
the thrusters out of phase.

31:43.987 --> 31:45.322
See if I can reduce the wobble.

31:52.454 --> 31:54.289
<i>Cable tension warning.</i>

31:57.209 --> 31:59.044
<i>Cable tension warning.</i>

32:04.007 --> 32:05.968
The asteroid's wobble is getting worse.

32:06.593 --> 32:08.220
<i>We're seeing more cable instability.</i>

32:12.558 --> 32:13.851
It's coming loose.

32:14.768 --> 32:16.979
<i>Prepare for
emergency disconnect procedure.</i>

32:17.563 --> 32:20.732
And I wanna know the second <i>Ranger</i> reaches
the last 20% of her RCS props.

32:20.732 --> 32:23.443
We run them dry, they're gonna
be in a world of shit up there.

32:24.903 --> 32:27.239
<i>RCS prop consumption is very high.</i>

32:28.240 --> 32:31.243
<i>Sir, errors in pitch
and yaw, both exceeding five degrees.</i>

32:31.910 --> 32:34.872
Altitude control is making
the oscillation worse.

32:35.789 --> 32:38.125
We can't shut down the RCS,
or we'll start tumbling.

32:40.627 --> 32:42.296
Kuz, what the hell are you doing?

32:42.296 --> 32:44.548
I'm going back out
to re-tension the cables.

32:45.132 --> 32:46.175
That's risky.

32:46.175 --> 32:48.260
I know, but what other choice do we have?

32:54.183 --> 32:56.018
All right. You got 30 minutes.

32:56.018 --> 32:58.312
Then I'm pulling the plug
and you better get your ass back inside.

32:58.312 --> 32:59.688
Copy.

33:00.397 --> 33:05.235
Happy Valley, we are performing a
contingency EVA to resecure the asteroid.

33:06.195 --> 33:08.155
Negative, <i>Ranger-1</i>. Stand down your EVA.

33:08.155 --> 33:11.950
<i>Everyone is to remain
in the ship until we assess the situation.</i>

33:11.950 --> 33:14.203
Sorry, Commander...

33:14.203 --> 33:16.038
I cannot understand you.

33:19.458 --> 33:20.918
Parker, where are you going?

33:20.918 --> 33:23.629
You're low on O2.
You don't have time to refill the tanks.

33:23.629 --> 33:25.631
It'll go quicker
with a second set of hands.

33:25.631 --> 33:26.590
Good man.

33:26.590 --> 33:28.675
Hey, what are you doing?

33:28.675 --> 33:31.136
Peters told us to stand down.
We're not trained for this kind of shit.

33:32.221 --> 33:34.973
If we don't get that asteroid
back to Mars, we don't get our bonus.

33:35.599 --> 33:38.644
- You know I need the money.
- Here I thought you were a hero.

33:39.645 --> 33:40.812
Takes all kinds.

33:43.899 --> 33:45.734
<i>...tension warning.</i>

33:50.447 --> 33:52.574

33:52.574 --> 33:53.992
<i>What's your status?</i>

33:53.992 --> 33:55.536
We're on the truss,

33:55.536 --> 33:59.623
ship side of the quad junction
translating towards the platform.

34:01.083 --> 34:04.002
Parker,
when we get to the bottom of the truss,

34:04.586 --> 34:09.257
I'm going to reactivate winch number four
and restore the cable tension.

34:09.257 --> 34:11.510
You do the same with winch number two.

34:11.510 --> 34:12.678
Copy.

34:26.984 --> 34:29.902
Jesus, the whole truss is flexing.

34:29.902 --> 34:33.322
<i>Ranger-1</i>,
there's structural failure of the truss.

34:33.824 --> 34:35.701
Parker, get away from there.

34:35.701 --> 34:36.994
I'm trying.

34:39.746 --> 34:41.164
It's coming apart!

34:43.250 --> 34:45.710
Parker! Parker, move!

34:46.670 --> 34:48.463
Parker, watch out!

34:48.463 --> 34:50.340
Move out of the way!

34:55.762 --> 34:57.556
Grigory, Parker, do you read?

34:57.556 --> 34:58.849
What's your status?

35:02.686 --> 35:05.564
<i>Ranger</i>, Parker is gone.

35:20.370 --> 35:23.248
Grigory, get back inside the air lock.
We're cutting this rock loose.

35:26.877 --> 35:28.879
The truss has collapsed around my leg.

35:28.879 --> 35:30.672
- Can you get it free?
- <i>No.</i>

35:30.672 --> 35:32.758
Start emergency disconnect sequence now.

35:32.758 --> 35:35.260
I'm cutting this fucking rock loose
once Kuz is back aboard.

35:35.260 --> 35:37.638
Tommy, assist me with
emergency suit donning and egress now.

35:37.638 --> 35:39.139
What are you--

35:39.139 --> 35:40.682
I'm going out there. Take my seat.

35:40.682 --> 35:42.142
No, you cannot.

35:53.987 --> 35:56.657
No. It is too late.

35:57.574 --> 36:00.994
There is no time. You must cut me loose.

36:02.162 --> 36:05.165
- I won't, Grigory.
- Your duty is to your ship.

36:05.165 --> 36:07.501
I'm not losing anyone else today.
I'm coming out there.

36:07.501 --> 36:08.627
Edward, listen to me.

36:09.294 --> 36:13.215
There is a hole in my suit.
My O2 is nearly gone.

36:13.715 --> 36:18.428
You must do what needs to be done
before everyone is lost.

36:19.012 --> 36:20.264
<i>Collision warning.</i>

36:25.811 --> 36:27.521
<i>Collision warning.</i>

36:29.648 --> 36:30.983
Goodbye, my friend.

36:31.900 --> 36:34.152
<i>Tell my wife and daughter I love them.</i>

37:00.012 --> 37:01.346
Goodbye, my friend.

37:33.629 --> 37:35.714
Flight, we have a structural failure
on one of the truss.

37:35.714 --> 37:37.925

altitude control failure.

37:40.093 --> 37:42.054
- Give me numbers, people.
- Come with me.

37:42.054 --> 37:44.640
Parker,
when we get to the bottom of the truss...

37:45.641 --> 37:50.062
<i>I'm going to reactivate winch
number four and restore the cable tension.</i>

37:50.062 --> 37:52.481
<i>Ranger-1</i>, switching to secondary feed.

38:18.715 --> 38:20.425
Aleida. Thrust!

38:21.510 --> 38:23.762
Upload a sequential diagnostic
to <i>Ranger-1</i>.

38:23.762 --> 38:26.431
We need to make sure
that each thruster is undamaged.

38:30.894 --> 38:34.273
I'll be right back. Send these up.

38:38.569 --> 38:39.903
Where are you going?

38:40.696 --> 38:43.907
Aleida. Aleida.

39:09.141 --> 39:12.269
So we're gonna put this
into a little mixing bowl.

39:12.978 --> 39:16.398
- And then all we have to do is add water.
- Okay.

39:16.398 --> 39:19.026
- That's right.
- You get the water.

39:19.026 --> 39:21.153
- The little mix can go in there.
- Okay.

39:22.362 --> 39:24.031
- Babe.
- Now put it in here?

39:25.991 --> 39:27.284
You need to come see this.

39:29.328 --> 39:33.040
<i>On a day that should have symbolized
the best of human achievement,</i>

39:33.040 --> 39:36.376
<i>instead the world is
reacting to tragic news.</i>

39:36.376 --> 39:41.048
<i>The joint M-7 mission to haul an asteroid
to Mars has gone tragically wrong</i>

39:41.048 --> 39:45.886
<i>and Russian hero Grigory Kuznetsov
and one other man have been killed.</i>

39:45.886 --> 39:49.890
<i>Kuznetsov is best known as
the first Soviet to step foot on Mars,</i>

39:49.890 --> 39:53.644
<i>hand in hand with now retired
NASA commander Danielle Poole.</i>

39:54.353 --> 39:56.146
<i>Questions are already being asked</i>

39:56.146 --> 39:59.024
<i>about how this tragic turn of events
could have happened.</i>

39:59.024 --> 40:03.403
<i>We're getting conflicting reports from
inside NASA about exactly what went wrong.</i>

40:03.403 --> 40:05.989
<i>Kuznetsov,
a recipient of the Order of Lenin</i>

40:05.989 --> 40:08.617
<i>for being the first
Soviet on Mars, was revered</i>

40:08.617 --> 40:11.411
<i>in the Soviet Union and across the world</i>

40:11.411 --> 40:16.166
<i>even in the United States where NASA head
Eli Hobson spoke to reporters.</i>

40:16.750 --> 40:19.294
<i>We here in Houston are truly heartbroken...</i>

40:23.632 --> 40:26.426
<i>We've been in close contact
with our partners in Roscosmos...</i>

40:27.553 --> 40:30.097
<i>Roscosmos, how may I help you?</i>

40:30.097 --> 40:32.724
Hello, this is Margaret Reynolds again.

40:32.724 --> 40:36.061
I'm trying to get in touch
with Director Catiche.

40:36.562 --> 40:39.523
<i>She has received all of your messages.</i>

40:39.523 --> 40:42.776
I only need five minutes.

40:42.776 --> 40:46.280
I do not understand
why I can't talk to her.

40:47.364 --> 40:49.575
<i>She will return your call
when she is able to.</i>

40:50.784 --> 40:51.827
<i>Thank you.</i>

40:55.831 --> 41:00.169
<i>...praising Kuznetsov
for his service to the nation and vowing</i>

41:00.169 --> 41:03.172
<i>to devote the entire
engineering team at Star City</i>

41:03.172 --> 41:05.883
<i>to analyze every aspect
of the Kronos mission.</i>

41:54.264 --> 41:57.809
Devils when they're up,
angels when they're down.

42:04.233 --> 42:05.442
Look at her.

42:06.610 --> 42:09.196
I still remember
when I used to hold her like this,

42:09.196 --> 42:11.114
and her head was in my hand.

42:22.042 --> 42:26.672
When you were out on Bruce II
for those long stretches,

42:28.590 --> 42:29.883
Sarah and me,

42:31.760 --> 42:37.266
sometimes we'd pretend
you were just camping out in the backyard.

42:39.142 --> 42:43.689
I was so worried about
something happening to you out there

42:43.689 --> 42:45.274
in the middle of nowhere.

42:46.817 --> 42:48.026
No one to help.

42:50.445 --> 42:53.532
And that was only a hundred miles away.

42:55.033 --> 42:58.161
Mars is...

42:58.161 --> 43:00.581
145 million miles away.

43:01.456 --> 43:02.457
I know.

43:07.963 --> 43:13.969
Those people that died today,
they had families.

43:14.553 --> 43:19.600
Families that are never
gonna see 'em again.

43:25.439 --> 43:29.943
Just-- Don't go, Miles.

43:32.487 --> 43:35.199
It's gonna be okay. I promise.

44:11.026 --> 44:12.569
This doesn't mean
we're getting back together.

44:12.569 --> 44:13.987
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

45:03.912 --> 45:05.080
Margaret Reynolds.

45:14.047 --> 45:17.301
I need to speak to Director Catiche.

45:17.301 --> 45:19.136
She's not available.

45:19.136 --> 45:20.888
You speak English.

45:20.888 --> 45:24.516
And French, German and Italian.
Would you like to see my credentials?

45:26.310 --> 45:28.437
I would like to see the director.

45:29.062 --> 45:31.106
We will hear anything you want to discuss

45:31.106 --> 45:35.360
at your regularly scheduled
appointment in nine days' time.

45:35.360 --> 45:36.904
When I first came here,

45:36.904 --> 45:40.032
I was promised consultations
on all space matters,

45:40.032 --> 45:41.950
and all I have been is
kept at arm's length.

45:42.618 --> 45:45.829
I need to see what caused the accident
and how the crew responded

45:45.829 --> 45:47.748
so I can help you work the problem.

45:47.748 --> 45:51.084
It has been almost 10 years
since you ran NASA.

45:51.084 --> 45:54.296
Most of the technology
of that day is obsolete.

45:54.796 --> 45:57.758
So what exactly do you think
you can provide

45:57.758 --> 46:00.469
that we are not better equipped to handle?

46:00.469 --> 46:03.096
Well, in your case, just about everything.

46:06.767 --> 46:08.185
Thank you for coming in.

46:08.185 --> 46:10.812
Please do not come unannounced again.

46:28.163 --> 46:32.084
<i>Hey, kiddo.
Hope you and Alex are doing good.</i>

46:34.044 --> 46:38.590
<i>It's been a rough couple of days up here.</i>

46:40.008 --> 46:42.761
<i>Losing Grigory was-- That was tough.</i>

46:44.805 --> 46:46.223
<i>We'd gotten pretty close.</i>

46:56.608 --> 46:59.194
<i>They've grounded any
further asteroid missions</i>

46:59.194 --> 47:01.196
<i>until the Mars
commission releases a report,</i>

47:01.196 --> 47:05.868
<i>and they're supposedly sending up
a new commander</i>

47:05.868 --> 47:07.995
<i>to get things back on track.</i>

47:09.454 --> 47:14.293
<i>I don't know who it is yet, but probably
best for me to stay here a little longer.</i>

47:15.002 --> 47:17.588
- Dad...
- <i>It's just a bad time to leave right now.</i>

47:17.588 --> 47:21.758
<i>You know, I'm the XO,
and everyone depends on me up here.</i>

47:21.758 --> 47:25.095
<i>I just need to make sure that things
have a smooth transition, you know,</i>

47:25.095 --> 47:29.266
<i>and I promise I'll come home
as soon as the new commander settles in.</i>

47:30.434 --> 47:31.435
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

47:32.811 --> 47:35.105
<i>Talk to you soon, okay? I love you.</i>

47:39.109 --> 47:40.652
What did Poppy say?

47:41.695 --> 47:42.821
Sweetie.

47:45.032 --> 47:48.327
Grandpa, he can't come back yet.

47:49.244 --> 47:51.538
He's gotta stay on Mars
a little while longer,

47:51.538 --> 47:53.457
but he promised
he would come back very soon.

47:53.457 --> 47:56.084
- Okay?
- Promise.

47:56.084 --> 47:59.630
What good is his promise?

47:59.630 --> 48:02.716
He promised to come back in '98.
In '99. 2001.

48:02.716 --> 48:05.719
- He's not coming back.
- Olga, please. Not in front of Alex.

48:06.762 --> 48:09.640
I'm done holding my tongue about that man.

48:10.182 --> 48:11.350
He's a selfish man.

49:16.832 --> 49:18.083
Sir, she's here.

49:19.251 --> 49:21.628
- Administrator Hobson?
- Eli, please.

49:22.421 --> 49:25.174
Thank you so much
for coming in on such short notice.

49:25.174 --> 49:26.717
I couldn't be more honored.

49:28.760 --> 49:30.304
Please, come in.

49:39.021 --> 49:41.440
- My boots.
- A proud moment for America.

49:42.274 --> 49:45.194
For the world really. What a journey.

49:45.194 --> 49:48.405
I mean, could you ever have guessed
when you first came to NASA

49:48.405 --> 49:53.785
that you would end up being
the first American to set foot on Mars?

49:53.785 --> 49:55.329
All I remember is landing on my ass.

49:59.124 --> 50:00.667
Well, what is it
you wanted to see me about?

50:00.667 --> 50:04.087
Yes. Well, as you've probably heard,

50:04.087 --> 50:06.465
we have grounded
the asteroid mining program

50:06.465 --> 50:08.759
until we can get to the bottom
of what happened up there.

50:08.759 --> 50:11.094
- I did.
- We're working up a report.

50:11.094 --> 50:12.888
The Soviets are doing the same.

50:13.388 --> 50:19.061
But what we do already know
is that certain decisions were made

50:19.061 --> 50:21.313
in the run-up to the accident.

50:21.980 --> 50:26.401
Breaking of protocols.
And Colonel Peters's position

50:26.401 --> 50:29.947
as commander of Happy Valley
has become untenable.

50:30.531 --> 50:32.658
Well, it's easy to blame
the guy in charge.

50:32.658 --> 50:35.118
It always is,
but that's part of being in charge.

50:35.786 --> 50:38.038
Taking responsibility
when things go south.

50:38.038 --> 50:40.040
You know that better than anyone.

50:41.375 --> 50:46.588
Which is why I want you to replace him.

50:49.967 --> 50:52.761
But doesn't command pass
to the Russians next?

50:52.761 --> 50:54.930
Well, since Peters is leaving midterm,

50:54.930 --> 50:57.307
they're allowing us
to replace him with an American.

50:57.307 --> 50:59.142
I don't even work for NASA anymore.

51:00.060 --> 51:01.520
I know it's a lot to ask.

51:01.520 --> 51:04.982
You chose to pursue a private life,
and God bless you for it.

51:04.982 --> 51:07.234
I probably should have done the same thing
after Chrysler.

51:07.234 --> 51:11.488
But when President Gore asked me to serve,

51:12.698 --> 51:15.200
I felt I had to repay
my debt to my country.

51:15.200 --> 51:17.661
And you did that by
slashing NASA's budget by 20%?

51:17.661 --> 51:22.749
When I got here, over 60% of the projects
were over budget or behind schedule.

51:22.749 --> 51:25.794
Look at the asteroid mining project,
even before this fiasco.

51:25.794 --> 51:27.254
It was a shit show. I heard.

51:27.254 --> 51:29.715
But it was finally headed
in the right direction.

51:30.382 --> 51:36.138
The M-7 nations have sunk untold resources
into building out Happy Valley

51:36.138 --> 51:40.184
for this asteroid mining program, and
they expect a return on that investment.

51:40.184 --> 51:43.520
And now with the accident
and all the questions it's raised,

51:44.980 --> 51:48.734
the president is about a red ass hair away
from canceling the whole thing altogether.

51:48.734 --> 51:51.069
That is incredibly shortsighted.

51:51.069 --> 51:54.448
After all the work we've
done up there, to just give up on it now?

51:54.448 --> 51:55.699
I know.

51:55.699 --> 51:58.869
That's why I want you to go up there
and turn things around.

51:58.869 --> 52:02.497
I haven't been to Mars
in almost seven years.

52:02.998 --> 52:06.335
- A lot has changed.
- True, but people respect you.

52:07.211 --> 52:11.757
They look up to you. Americans, Russians,
heck, even the North Koreans.

52:13.342 --> 52:16.303
You know how things work up there.
You know the pitfalls.

52:17.346 --> 52:19.056
And they'll all listen to you.

52:19.765 --> 52:21.308
Especially Ed Baldwin.

52:22.434 --> 52:24.561
- Ed Baldwin doesn't listen to anybody.
- Yeah.

52:25.270 --> 52:26.897
That's a big part of the problem.

52:27.397 --> 52:32.236
He has been XO up there a long time,
set in his ways you might say.

52:34.947 --> 52:37.866
I hear you, Eli. I really do.

52:38.534 --> 52:39.952
And I wish you well.

52:39.952 --> 52:42.579
But I'm sorry. I just--

52:45.082 --> 52:46.834
I just can't do it all over again.

52:48.877 --> 52:51.463
You accepted my invitation
to talk this time.

52:54.299 --> 52:56.093
Something must have changed.

53:01.849 --> 53:03.141
Kuz was my friend.

53:05.227 --> 53:08.146
We grew very close up there
those 15 months.

53:09.857 --> 53:11.692
Ed, he was just--

53:13.735 --> 53:16.738
He was a wreck
after what happened to Karen.

53:18.824 --> 53:20.075
But Kuz was my rock.

53:21.660 --> 53:24.037
I am here because of him.

53:28.584 --> 53:32.337
I can't begin to imagine
how difficult that was.

53:33.338 --> 53:38.719
The nine of you up there
putting your lives on the line for Mars.

53:39.595 --> 53:40.888
But all of that...

53:42.222 --> 53:44.808
All of that will have been in vain

53:45.350 --> 53:48.812
if we don't get this thing back on track now.

54:01.658 --> 54:04.077
Hey, no. These are mine.

54:04.077 --> 54:07.331
You want some?
Well, I don't know about this.

54:07.331 --> 54:09.124
You're gonna have to get it.

54:09.124 --> 54:11.251
Come on. Get your backpacks.
We're leaving in five minutes.

54:12.669 --> 54:14.963
- And no back seat deejaying.
- Fine.

54:14.963 --> 54:18.175
Can we listen to music, please?
I'm sick of Howard Stern.

54:18.175 --> 54:19.551
What'd I just say?

54:24.515 --> 54:26.642
Aleida. It's work.

54:41.490 --> 54:44.034
- You good?
- Yeah, I'm good.

54:45.202 --> 54:46.620
I'm just gonna work from home today.

54:46.620 --> 54:48.705
All right. We're gonna head out.
I'll see you tonight.

54:49.790 --> 54:52.084
- Love you.
- Love you too.

54:54.753 --> 54:56.213
Dad, let's go.

56:47.157 --> 56:48.659
They are from the North.

56:50.244 --> 56:52.204
They fly down for the winter.

56:55.290 --> 56:57.084
I do not blame them.

56:59.461 --> 57:01.296
They're called Northern Bullfinches.

57:05.133 --> 57:06.718
They're patient birds.

57:09.179 --> 57:12.683
They know they have to wait
for the soil before the flowers bloom.

57:16.311 --> 57:17.771
Do we know each other?

57:18.438 --> 57:19.481
I know you.

57:26.738 --> 57:27.739
Who are you?

57:28.740 --> 57:30.993
Someone with your best interests at heart.

57:32.828 --> 57:37.291
And those interests are not served
by making waves at Star City.

57:40.252 --> 57:42.296
It is winter now, Miss Madison.

57:44.298 --> 57:45.841
But soon it will be spring.

57:48.677 --> 57:52.472
You must be patient like our friends here.

58:47.069 --> 58:50.948
Well, look who decided to grace us
with a visit.

58:52.324 --> 58:53.700
See, that ain't fair.

58:53.700 --> 58:58.038
How is it that you manage
to get more and more handsome with age?

58:58.038 --> 58:59.831
Come here. Hey, Cap.

59:04.545 --> 59:05.546
What?

59:05.546 --> 59:08.924
- William Joseph Tyler.
- This little thing?

59:09.925 --> 59:12.261
So Rob finally decided
to make an honest man out of you?

59:12.261 --> 59:13.679
He's trying.

59:14.304 --> 59:16.014
Well, I am so happy for you guys.

59:16.014 --> 59:17.975
Really. Congratulations.

59:17.975 --> 59:20.727
So, when is the big day?

59:21.228 --> 59:23.981
- Next spring. Mark it down.
- Okay. I will.

59:23.981 --> 59:26.608
And I heard you've been kicking ass

59:26.608 --> 59:29.778
- over here at Astronaut Affairs.
- Keeping tabs on me, huh?

59:29.778 --> 59:32.281
I'm just making sure my tutelage paid off.

59:32.281 --> 59:33.657
And then some.

59:34.408 --> 59:36.702
So, what brings you to the ranch?

59:37.995 --> 59:39.079
Hobson.

59:39.079 --> 59:43.083
He wants me
to head back up to Happy Valley.

59:43.959 --> 59:45.586
Take over for Peters.

59:46.170 --> 59:47.171
Really?

59:48.755 --> 59:49.756
And?

59:52.217 --> 59:53.468
I told him I'd think about it.

59:55.095 --> 59:58.265
I mean, they could really use you
up there. It's a mess.

59:58.265 --> 01:00:02.227
I suppose so, but I don't know.

01:00:04.563 --> 01:00:06.064
Heading back up there again

01:00:06.732 --> 01:00:09.151
after everything
that happened with Danny in the end.

01:00:11.695 --> 01:00:15.199
I just-- I don't know if I could.

01:00:17.743 --> 01:00:22.414
Hey, that wasn't on you, Cap.

01:00:23.790 --> 01:00:26.418
You gotta know that. We all do.

01:00:28.253 --> 01:00:32.257
There was just no other choice. You know,
you did what you had to do for all of us.

01:00:33.342 --> 01:00:36.595
I've been telling myself that
for the last seven years.

01:00:37.596 --> 01:00:39.515
Doesn't help me sleep any better at night.

01:00:40.599 --> 01:00:41.600
You gotta move on.

01:00:42.726 --> 01:00:44.853
Get back in the saddle.
It'll be good for you.

01:00:45.854 --> 01:00:49.525
But that's the thing,
is you don't ever really move on.

01:00:50.734 --> 01:00:53.862
The people you've hurt,
the people you've lost,

01:00:54.613 --> 01:00:59.243
you just carry 'em around with you
wherever you go.

01:01:03.413 --> 01:01:06.291
"Through the shining gate
where the angels wait."

01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:11.213
I will see you around, Cap.

01:01:12.965 --> 01:01:14.049
Or maybe not.

01:02:15.903 --> 01:02:20.157
<i>We are a go for a plasma drive
start and Trans-Mars injection</i>

01:02:20.157 --> 01:02:25.329
<i>in five, four, three, two, one.</i>
