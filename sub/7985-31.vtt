00:03.006 --> 00:04.208
Girls, where is JoJo?

00:04.208 --> 00:05.645
ASHLEE:
She's not here.

00:05.645 --> 00:07.983
I set the bar high for JoJo,
and she walked out.

00:07.983 --> 00:10.622
JILL: <i>Abby's been</i>
<i>freaking out because</i>

00:10.622 --> 00:12.324
maybe she's facing jail time.

00:12.324 --> 00:14.930
<i>All that time she spent</i>
<i>with those minis, I mean,</i>

00:14.930 --> 00:15.965
<i>that should be</i>
<i>writing on the wall that...</i>

00:15.965 --> 00:18.003
ASHLEE:
They're time‐suckers.

00:18.003 --> 00:20.274
ABBY LEE: <i>Today you are getting</i>
<i>your jackets because</i>

00:20.274 --> 00:23.446
your group routine score
was higher than theirs!

00:23.446 --> 00:25.585
(cheering)

00:25.585 --> 00:27.656
Here you go.

00:27.656 --> 00:29.458
ABBY LEE:
<i>Coming up on</i> Dance Moms...

00:29.458 --> 00:32.064
JILL: <i>That mini team is</i>
<i>so distracting to her.</i>

00:32.064 --> 00:33.233
(squeals)

00:33.233 --> 00:34.402
<i>But we're not gonna</i>

00:34.402 --> 00:36.707
sit back and just
let our kids fall to crap.

00:36.707 --> 00:38.778
ABBY LEE: So, you're
doing a group routine.

00:38.778 --> 00:41.550
I'm bringing two
ALDC L. A. students

00:41.550 --> 00:43.053
to dance with
the group routine.

00:43.053 --> 00:43.888
The four of you

00:43.888 --> 00:45.324
<i>will be in a commercial.</i>

00:45.324 --> 00:46.794
ERIK:
Way better, Kalani.

00:46.794 --> 00:48.831
We have a commercial,
we have competition.

00:48.831 --> 00:50.935
This is not the way
to really do things.

00:50.935 --> 00:52.939
What else can happen this week?

00:52.939 --> 00:55.377
This is a (bleep) show.

00:55.377 --> 00:58.316
That little kid right there
isn't stepping on that stage!

00:58.316 --> 01:01.155
They're not doing a crappy dance
that they were given.

01:01.155 --> 01:02.358
End of discussion.

01:03.995 --> 01:06.900
♪ Livin' on the dance floor. ♪

01:06.900 --> 01:09.071

ABBY LEE: <i>Come on, guys,</i>
<i>let's go! Pyramid!</i>

01:16.019 --> 01:18.958
JILL: <i>It's always frustrating</i>
<i>coming into pyramid</i>

01:18.958 --> 01:19.960
<i>after a loss.</i>

01:19.960 --> 01:21.764
<i>Ever since those minis arrived,</i>

01:21.764 --> 01:25.137
<i>Abby has had a hard time</i>
<i>managing both teams.</i>

01:25.137 --> 01:28.511
<i>And now, her favoritism</i>
<i>towards the minis</i>

01:28.511 --> 01:30.581
is skyrocketing.

01:30.581 --> 01:32.418
Normally, our girls are
not stressed.

01:32.418 --> 01:35.290
They are stressed this week,

01:35.290 --> 01:36.426
'cause the prop
is not cooperating.

01:36.426 --> 01:38.664
They're fine.
It's two minutes.

01:38.664 --> 01:41.035
She's trying to
build one team up

01:41.035 --> 01:42.471
<i>by tearing the other one down.</i>

01:42.471 --> 01:45.077
<i>I don't like this dynamic</i>
<i>that Abby has set up,</i>

01:45.077 --> 01:48.016
and we need to make sure
that it stops now.

01:48.016 --> 01:50.153
ABBY LEE:
Okay, so,

01:50.153 --> 01:52.959
Juniors... you lost.

01:52.959 --> 01:55.698
Fix it, now.

01:55.698 --> 01:58.571
Now, I know that
this side of the room

01:58.571 --> 02:00.708
is not gonna give
a big rousing cheer,

02:00.708 --> 02:03.012
but I think you guys
can make some noise.

02:03.012 --> 02:04.549
The mini group‐‐

02:04.549 --> 02:07.087
you guys were the overall high
score small wonders routine.

02:07.087 --> 02:08.557
JILL:
Yay!

02:08.557 --> 02:11.429
(whoops)

02:11.429 --> 02:12.565
(applause)

02:12.565 --> 02:14.101
See? Don't listen to her.

02:14.101 --> 02:16.874
We are all <i>very</i> proud
of you guys.

02:16.874 --> 02:19.211
SARI: But is that why
you left, Jill? Just asking.

02:19.211 --> 02:21.115
HOLLY: Abby was giving
the jackets to your team,

02:21.115 --> 02:24.054
and so it didn't really
involve us at that point,

02:24.054 --> 02:25.558
so we were letting you have
your moment.

02:25.558 --> 02:27.529
ASHLEE:
Your guys were upset
when you walked away.

02:27.529 --> 02:29.131
It wasn't positive.

02:29.131 --> 02:32.505
She knocked this team down
to make you guys look better

02:32.505 --> 02:34.341
and hand you your jackets.

02:34.341 --> 02:37.114
It shouldn't be because they
beat their own team members.

02:37.114 --> 02:38.818
HOLLY:
We're not here
to pick a fight.

02:38.818 --> 02:39.986
We're not part of that.

02:39.986 --> 02:41.322
STACEY:
<i>I think the juniors</i>

02:41.322 --> 02:43.159
<i>are jealous of the minis</i>
<i>because</i>

02:43.159 --> 02:45.998
we've got Abby time
even when they have no dance,

02:45.998 --> 02:49.004
when she "should" be working
with the other team.

02:49.004 --> 02:51.375
<i>To me, that shows that she's</i>
<i>invested in our girls.</i>

02:51.375 --> 02:54.481
<i>The jealousy is written</i>
<i>all over their faces.</i>

02:54.481 --> 02:57.321
So, on the bottom
of the mini pyramid...

02:57.321 --> 03:00.160
Peyton. Good job
in the group routine.

03:00.160 --> 03:03.166
<i>You learning the dance</i>
<i>is getting better.</i>

03:03.166 --> 03:05.538
Keep it up.

03:05.538 --> 03:07.140
Next, we have

03:07.140 --> 03:08.777
Alexus.

03:08.777 --> 03:10.848
I'm telling you the same thing
that I'm telling Peyton.

03:10.848 --> 03:13.386
It's getting better.
Keep it up.

03:15.190 --> 03:17.729
Next...

03:17.729 --> 03:19.365
Elliana.

03:19.365 --> 03:22.337
<i>Good job in the group routine.</i>
<i>You did well.</i>

03:22.337 --> 03:24.943
Next, we have Areana.

03:24.943 --> 03:27.114
You had a featured spot.

03:27.114 --> 03:29.385
<i>Did you nail it?</i>

03:29.385 --> 03:31.690
Yes.

03:31.690 --> 03:33.994
And on the top
of the pyramid...

03:33.994 --> 03:35.263
(cheers, applause)

03:35.263 --> 03:38.202
(laughs)

03:40.440 --> 03:41.843
Lilli, you had

03:41.843 --> 03:43.046
<i>a winning solo.</i>

03:43.046 --> 03:44.448
<i>Your score was really high.</i>

03:44.448 --> 03:45.918
<i>You were one tenth of a point</i>

03:45.918 --> 03:47.154
under Brynn.

03:47.154 --> 03:48.323
That's pretty darn good.

03:48.323 --> 03:50.226
All right.

03:50.226 --> 03:52.799
ABBY LEE:
<i>This week's a whole</i>
<i>tribute to Muhammad Ali.</i>

03:52.799 --> 03:56.405
Minis, you're doing...
a duet.

03:57.642 --> 04:00.280
Our duet is going to...

04:03.787 --> 04:05.457
Lilli, our big winner.

04:05.457 --> 04:07.662
And...

04:08.897 --> 04:10.200
Peyton.

04:10.200 --> 04:12.437
(applause, cheering)

04:12.437 --> 04:14.676
So Lilli and Peyton
will be doing

04:14.676 --> 04:17.982
an acro gym duet

04:17.982 --> 04:21.990
entitled "Sting
Like a Bee."

04:21.990 --> 04:23.794
Your group routine‐‐

04:23.794 --> 04:25.163
You are doing

04:25.163 --> 04:27.000
"Cast the First Stone,"

04:27.000 --> 04:28.704
key word being "stone."

04:28.704 --> 04:30.574
This will be
a lyrical piece.

04:30.574 --> 04:32.411
You are statues.

04:32.411 --> 04:37.254
So you are actually going
to portray these statues,

04:37.254 --> 04:38.824
except you come to life,
all right?

04:38.824 --> 04:43.132
Now, Kerri, I want the duet
to go off without a hitch.

04:43.132 --> 04:44.936
So I took Peyton out
of the group dance.

04:44.936 --> 04:47.441
Okay? I want them to
get started right away.

04:47.441 --> 04:48.844
Let's go.

04:48.844 --> 04:50.881
Peyton has been improving
every week.

04:50.881 --> 04:53.453
<i>But she's still not up</i>
<i>to the level</i>

04:53.453 --> 04:55.090
<i>where the other girls are,</i>

04:55.090 --> 04:56.827
<i>especially when it's</i>
<i>a lyrical routine.</i>

04:56.827 --> 05:02.003
So I am pulling Peyton
from the group routine so that,

05:02.003 --> 05:04.709
<i>A) my girls have</i>
<i>a better shot at winning,</i>

05:04.709 --> 05:07.515
and B) she can concentrate
on the duet.

05:07.515 --> 05:09.184
All right, so,

05:09.184 --> 05:11.088
at the bottom
of the pyramid...

05:12.424 --> 05:14.261
Kalani.

05:14.261 --> 05:16.533
Next we have... Nia.

05:17.535 --> 05:20.508
Next, Kendall.

05:20.508 --> 05:23.847
And at the top the pyramid,
the high score solo...

05:23.847 --> 05:26.152
(applause)
...Brynn.

05:26.152 --> 05:27.487
Okay, let's move on.

05:27.487 --> 05:29.659
ASHLEE: <i>Seriously, Abby?</i>
<i>That's it?</i>

05:29.659 --> 05:30.961
<i>That's all we're gonna get?</i>

05:30.961 --> 05:32.397
You spent, like,
20 minutes on the minis.

05:32.397 --> 05:33.767
Where's our time?

05:33.767 --> 05:36.038
ABBY LEE: We're traveling
to Upland, California,

05:36.038 --> 05:39.211
to attend New York
Dance Experience.

05:39.211 --> 05:41.415
So, you're doing
a group routine,

05:41.415 --> 05:43.887
and... it's gonna be hip‐hop.

05:43.887 --> 05:45.758
(cheering, applause)
HOLLY:
Oh!

05:45.758 --> 05:47.695
The girls love hip‐hop.

05:47.695 --> 05:49.966
ABBY LEE: We have something
else happening this week.

05:49.966 --> 05:52.638
I have a guest
choreographer coming in,

05:52.638 --> 05:55.778
because the four of you
will all be in a commercial.

05:55.778 --> 05:58.049
Wow!
HOLLY:
Oh! That's fun!

05:58.049 --> 06:00.888
ABBY LEE: <i>I have been approached</i>
<i>by a dance floor manufacturer</i>

06:00.888 --> 06:02.825
to use my girls
for a commercial.

06:02.825 --> 06:05.831
<i>It's one of the reasons</i>
<i>that we came out here.</i>

06:05.831 --> 06:07.668
You never know who's gonna see
it, or where it might lead.

06:07.668 --> 06:09.404
So, the commercial is not
the group dance?

06:09.404 --> 06:12.077
These are separate.
Two separate, yes.

06:12.077 --> 06:13.446
So they do the commercial today,

06:13.446 --> 06:14.816
and they learn
the group dance when?
Tomorrow.

06:14.816 --> 06:16.151
Because I want them
to concentrate

06:16.151 --> 06:17.354
on what they have today.

06:17.354 --> 06:20.326
Plus, tomorrow
I'm bringing

06:20.326 --> 06:23.466
two ALDC L. A. students
to dance with the group.

06:23.466 --> 06:25.436
JoJo doesn't want to be
on the competition team?

06:25.436 --> 06:26.640
Plenty of kids do.

06:26.640 --> 06:28.175
<i>I want to do a hip‐hop number.</i>

06:28.175 --> 06:29.912
<i>I need more kids</i>
<i>on that stage.</i>

06:29.912 --> 06:32.183
There's two girls
who catch my eye

06:32.183 --> 06:33.987
every time they're
in hip‐hop class‐‐

06:33.987 --> 06:37.394
<i>Saryna and Jayden.</i>
<i>They're amazing at hip‐hop.</i>

06:37.394 --> 06:39.532
They are going to take the level
of a hip‐hop number

06:39.532 --> 06:41.302
and raise the bar.

06:41.302 --> 06:42.437
ABBY LEE:
Come on, guys.
Let's go!

06:42.437 --> 06:44.742
Ah!
Oh, wow.
Oh.

06:44.742 --> 06:45.878
That's a crew.

06:45.878 --> 06:47.113
ABBY LEE:
Hello. How are you?

06:47.113 --> 06:48.182
Good, how are you, Abby?

06:48.182 --> 06:49.952
Good, good, good.
Good to see you.

06:49.952 --> 06:52.023
(gasps)
This is so exciting!

06:52.023 --> 06:55.664
KENDALL: <i>I'm sitting in a room</i>
<i>with teenage boys...</i>

06:55.664 --> 06:57.133
and they're cute, so...

06:57.133 --> 06:58.970
good luck to me.
(chuckles)

07:00.574 --> 07:04.916
This is Mike Bertini,
and, uh, he's the shoe guy.

07:04.916 --> 07:05.951
And this is Erik.

07:05.951 --> 07:09.391
Erik and I have worked
together before.

07:09.391 --> 07:11.195
Excited to see you guys.
Hello!

07:11.195 --> 07:13.633
Yeah.
ABBY LEE: How are you?

07:13.633 --> 07:15.370
Great to work with you again.
I'm excited.

07:15.370 --> 07:17.708
He is... very cut and dry.

07:17.708 --> 07:20.012
He's very demanding
of his dancers.

07:20.012 --> 07:21.583
I am very confident

07:21.583 --> 07:22.985
I can go have a spa day,

07:22.985 --> 07:25.323
and come back and know

07:25.323 --> 07:27.995
that he was just
as tough as I was,

07:27.995 --> 07:29.231
and it would all be done.

07:29.231 --> 07:30.567
JILL:
<i>Surprise, surprise.</i>

07:30.567 --> 07:33.239
Abby's gonna go have a spa day?

07:33.239 --> 07:34.942
<i>She doesn't want to work</i>
<i>with our kids this week?</i>

07:34.942 --> 07:36.278
Par for the course.

07:36.278 --> 07:37.480
<i>This is a little disappointing.</i>

07:37.480 --> 07:38.784
<i>However, it might be</i>
<i>a good thing.</i>

07:38.784 --> 07:41.355
<i>I really don't want</i>
<i>Abby involved.</i>

07:41.355 --> 07:43.760
Two reasons. One, she doesn't
<i>want</i> to be involved,

07:43.760 --> 07:47.501
and two, she effs up everything
she puts her hands on.

07:47.501 --> 07:49.605
Move! Move!

07:49.605 --> 07:51.275
Does this happen every day?
Pretty much.

07:51.275 --> 07:52.377
MAN:
<i>Awesome.</i>

07:52.377 --> 07:53.914
I'm not gonna be able
to use Mackenzie

07:53.914 --> 07:56.519
in a... in a vocal part...

07:56.519 --> 07:59.324
No, no, no, no.
She's not in it at all.

07:59.324 --> 08:02.030
Abby has ruined opportunities
for our kids in the past.

08:02.030 --> 08:04.936
We cannot let history
repeat itself.

08:04.936 --> 08:06.906
MIKE:
We're doing a video
for a new product.

08:06.906 --> 08:10.246
It is a dance shoe that has
L. E. D. lights

08:10.246 --> 08:11.816
built into the sole.

08:11.816 --> 08:13.820
ABBY LEE:
Here they are!

08:13.820 --> 08:15.389
You're like
Prince Charming!

08:15.389 --> 08:17.227
(chuckles)
Cinderella!

08:17.227 --> 08:18.830
You get to see
what shoe fits.

08:18.830 --> 08:19.932
Oh!

08:19.932 --> 08:22.370
MIKE: They change
different colors.

08:22.370 --> 08:25.376
This video's gonna be seen
by millions of people.

08:25.376 --> 08:26.846
And this product is
all about confidence.

08:26.846 --> 08:28.182
We've got a few hours
to do the shoot.

08:28.182 --> 08:29.752
We don't have a few days.

08:29.752 --> 08:31.355
You need to bring it.

08:31.355 --> 08:32.457
Erik, you got anything

08:32.457 --> 08:33.693
you want to talk
about with the...

08:33.693 --> 08:35.096
with the choreography?
Then come here.

08:35.096 --> 08:36.265
Yeah, I'm looking
for high energy.

08:36.265 --> 08:37.467
Obviously, I'm
looking for girls

08:37.467 --> 08:38.469
that can keep up

08:38.469 --> 08:39.539
with the boys.

08:39.539 --> 08:41.008
Every single one
of these guys

08:41.008 --> 08:43.112
is represented by all
the top agencies right now.

08:43.112 --> 08:45.049
And these are the guys
that are doing things that

08:45.049 --> 08:47.788
you ultimately want to be
doing, in terms of jobs.

08:47.788 --> 08:48.857
So, are you guys up for this?

08:48.857 --> 08:49.859
ALL:
Yeah!

08:49.859 --> 08:51.194
MIKE:
All right. All right.

08:51.194 --> 08:52.798
HOLLY:
<i>What else could</i>
<i>happen this week?</i>

08:52.798 --> 08:53.800
<i>We have the commercial.</i>

08:53.800 --> 08:55.771
<i>We have competition.</i>

08:55.771 --> 08:57.006
We have two new team members.

08:57.006 --> 08:59.110
Okay, like... w‐what next?

08:59.110 --> 09:01.214
And six, plié, seven.

09:01.214 --> 09:03.152
Pop it up,
eight and one.

09:03.152 --> 09:04.789
Nice job.

09:04.789 --> 09:06.826
(Southern accent):
How are my baby bumblebees?

09:06.826 --> 09:08.162
PEYTON:
We're good.
JULIAN: Good.

09:08.162 --> 09:10.867
She cannot wait to get in
to work with those minis.

09:10.867 --> 09:12.203
She loves them.

09:12.203 --> 09:13.439
KIRA:
Especially
a good acro duet.

09:13.439 --> 09:15.777
Yeah. That's her fave.

09:15.777 --> 09:17.615
ABBY LEE:
So, you guys are doing...

09:17.615 --> 09:19.117
<i>"Sting like a Bee."</i>

09:19.117 --> 09:20.119
<i>And that's a famous quote</i>

09:20.119 --> 09:22.156
that Muhammad Ali used to say.

09:22.156 --> 09:24.027
"Float like
a butterfly,

09:24.027 --> 09:25.029
sting like a bee."

09:25.029 --> 09:26.532
And what he meant by that was,

09:26.532 --> 09:27.901
in the boxing ring,

09:27.901 --> 09:29.705
he was light on his feet.

09:29.705 --> 09:31.441
<i>So, he would wear out</i>
<i>the opponent,</i>

09:31.441 --> 09:33.112
moving around the ring so much.

09:33.112 --> 09:36.251
But every once in a while,
he would boom,

09:36.251 --> 09:37.554
<i>and that meant</i>
<i>sting like a bee.</i>

09:37.554 --> 09:38.623
<i>And that was kind</i>
<i>of his "trick."</i>

09:38.623 --> 09:41.896
So, now let me see <i>your</i> trick.

09:41.896 --> 09:43.533
JULIAN:
<i>Here we go. Six, seven, and...</i>

09:43.533 --> 09:47.006
one, and two, and three,
and four and da! Chaines turns.

09:47.006 --> 09:48.843
And your arms
up and up...

09:48.843 --> 09:50.012
(whoops)

09:50.012 --> 09:51.649
STACEY:
Ooh, she likes this!

09:51.649 --> 09:53.118
JULIAN:
<i>Nice, and hit and circle.</i>

09:53.118 --> 09:56.091
Four, five, six,
seven, and up.

09:56.091 --> 09:58.162
Two, three and clear.

09:58.162 --> 09:59.565
And switch.

09:59.565 --> 10:01.468
One, two, three, turn.

10:01.468 --> 10:02.504
(whoops)

10:02.504 --> 10:04.474
Circles...
Nice so far, ladies.

10:04.474 --> 10:05.777
Oh, my God!

10:05.777 --> 10:07.681
Well, that makes me happy;
she's happy!
My God!

10:07.681 --> 10:09.150
Oh, my God, she
was totally...
She likes it!

10:09.150 --> 10:10.219
I've never seen her
that happy before!

10:10.219 --> 10:11.221
She likes it!

10:11.221 --> 10:12.457
I'm never seen Abby

10:12.457 --> 10:13.893
more happier for a routine.

10:15.329 --> 10:17.200
Good job!
KERRI: <i>I'm so excited</i>

10:17.200 --> 10:18.202
for Peyton's duet.

10:18.202 --> 10:20.039
I think this is a great routine.

10:20.039 --> 10:21.776
<i>This is the first time</i>
<i>Abby's realized</i>

10:21.776 --> 10:22.811
<i>what type of dancer</i>

10:22.811 --> 10:25.116
Peyton really is.

10:25.116 --> 10:26.786
ERIK:
<i>All right, spread out</i>
<i>on the floor, guys.</i>

10:26.786 --> 10:28.590
We're gonna learn the combo;
this is the big group part

10:28.590 --> 10:30.594
where everyone dances
at the end, all right?

10:30.594 --> 10:32.831
<i>Here we go.</i>

10:32.831 --> 10:35.604
♪ ♪
So, we're gonna slide up on one.

10:35.604 --> 10:37.875
Two.

10:37.875 --> 10:40.479
Three and four.

10:40.479 --> 10:41.916
And then end.

10:41.916 --> 10:43.987
Right and chin comes up.

10:43.987 --> 10:46.158
One, two, three and four.

10:46.158 --> 10:50.366
And, six, seven, eight,
and, two, three, four.

10:50.366 --> 10:51.536
That choreography

10:51.536 --> 10:53.472
<i>looks hard.</i>

10:53.472 --> 10:55.075
Let's go.

10:55.075 --> 10:57.781
Five, six, seven, eight.

10:57.781 --> 11:00.019
Six, six, move,
ba, ba, up.

11:00.019 --> 11:02.023
Slide your waist, slide.

11:02.023 --> 11:04.628
Up, down, hit, up, down.

11:04.628 --> 11:06.566
Slide your waist

11:06.566 --> 11:07.734
Move, ba, ba, up.

11:15.182 --> 11:16.819
HOLLY:
Know what the problem is,

11:16.819 --> 11:18.556
<i>with this?</i>
<i>Is that this is</i>

11:18.556 --> 11:19.792
<i>a great opportunity for them,</i>

11:19.792 --> 11:22.363
<i>but the disadvantage</i>
<i>is they only have</i>

11:22.363 --> 11:24.535
one full day
of rehearsal.

11:24.535 --> 11:26.471
The girls will learn
their competition dance,

11:26.471 --> 11:29.277
<i>and then they have</i>
<i>to kind of shelve that,</i>

11:29.277 --> 11:32.416
<i>do the commercial, and then</i>
<i>kind of dust off the shelf</i>

11:32.416 --> 11:34.922
and do competition.

11:34.922 --> 11:36.224
That's so disjointed.

11:36.224 --> 11:38.161
This is not the way
to really do things.

11:40.032 --> 11:42.905
HOLLY:
<i>I see the pattern</i>
<i>emerging once again.</i>

11:42.905 --> 11:44.575
They're not gonna have a lot
of time to rehearse

11:44.575 --> 11:47.781
<i>and Abby's not</i>
<i>gonna be engaged.</i>

11:47.781 --> 11:50.553
I am sure Abby did not think
this all the way through.

11:50.553 --> 11:52.023
Or, if she did,
she just doesn't care.

11:52.023 --> 11:54.628
MIKE:
The boys are just
standing out so much more

11:54.628 --> 11:56.431
than the girls that...

12:01.909 --> 12:03.546
Girls.

12:03.546 --> 12:05.082
You don't look confident.

12:05.082 --> 12:06.318
ERIK:
You're dancing like...

12:06.318 --> 12:07.320
uh, we just got
to get through it.

12:07.320 --> 12:09.057
Don't.
Because I see

12:09.057 --> 12:10.694
what you guys are capable of,
and what you do

12:10.694 --> 12:12.564
and it doesn't
equal right now.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.235
MIKE:
<i>I don't want someone</i>

12:15.235 --> 12:16.605
looking at my brand and

12:16.605 --> 12:18.108
having you represent it as...

12:18.108 --> 12:19.578
yeah, she's an okay dancer.

12:19.578 --> 12:20.580
You know?

12:20.580 --> 12:21.916
You... You got
to hit it.

12:23.118 --> 12:24.354
It's sad,

12:24.354 --> 12:26.091
<i>but Abby has clearly chosen</i>

12:26.091 --> 12:28.061
<i>where she wants</i>
<i>to be this week.</i>

12:28.061 --> 12:29.965
<i>And now, it's up to us moms</i>

12:29.965 --> 12:31.602
<i>to pick these girls up,</i>

12:31.602 --> 12:33.639
<i>protect their reputation</i>
<i>and make sure</i>

12:33.639 --> 12:35.510
<i>they nail this commercial.</i>

12:35.510 --> 12:38.181
Because we know that Abby
doesn't give a damn.

12:50.540 --> 12:52.577
ABBY LEE: <i>Okay.</i>
<i>This is the group routine.</i>

12:52.577 --> 12:54.648
<i>"Cast the First Stone."</i>

12:54.648 --> 12:56.317
Referring to your moms,

12:56.317 --> 12:58.656
and why does somebody‐‐

12:58.656 --> 13:00.359
and it's a different
person every time‐‐

13:00.359 --> 13:01.695
<i>have to open their mouth</i>

13:01.695 --> 13:02.831
<i>and say something nasty</i>

13:02.831 --> 13:03.900
<i>and start all the bickering?</i>

13:03.900 --> 13:05.603
<i>I don't know.</i>

13:05.603 --> 13:06.972
But...

13:06.972 --> 13:09.477
<i>let's see what we have,</i>
<i>from the top.</i>

13:09.477 --> 13:10.947
Face me and do it.

13:12.918 --> 13:14.888
You're supposed to
adage without pausing.

13:14.888 --> 13:17.293
YOLANDA: <i>Clearly,</i>
<i>"Cast the First Stone" is a dig</i>

13:17.293 --> 13:18.930
<i>on us moms.</i>

13:18.930 --> 13:20.065
<i>But I think</i>
<i>we've learned our lesson.</i>

13:20.065 --> 13:21.101
<i>We know that when we get along,</i>

13:21.101 --> 13:22.804
Abby pays a lot
more attention to us.

13:22.804 --> 13:24.675
<i>So, we just need to keep</i>

13:24.675 --> 13:26.612
Abby on our good side,

13:26.612 --> 13:28.749
but in order to do that,
our girls

13:28.749 --> 13:30.252
<i>have got to win.</i>

13:30.252 --> 13:31.354
ABBY LEE:
I don't like that pose.

13:31.354 --> 13:32.924
And she did,
like, front attitude...

13:32.924 --> 13:34.060
Yeah.

13:34.060 --> 13:36.097
...and then développé
her leg to arabesque.

13:36.097 --> 13:38.135
They're just
capable of more.

13:39.237 --> 13:40.840
WOMAN:
Nice, guys!
MAN: Good!

13:40.840 --> 13:43.345
STACEY:
<i>Honestly, for still having</i>

13:43.345 --> 13:45.550
another day, that
looks really good.

13:45.550 --> 13:46.685
Even though I guess
it's not done.

13:46.685 --> 13:48.221
That's a problem.

13:48.221 --> 13:49.591
JILL:
<i>Our girls have been here</i>

13:49.591 --> 13:50.593
<i>all morning and she spent</i>

13:50.593 --> 13:52.931
all her time with the minis.

13:52.931 --> 13:55.537
You notice that one
week they did dance,

13:55.537 --> 13:57.507
that's the week our kids
really excelled.

13:57.507 --> 13:58.509
ASHLEE:
Yeah.

13:58.509 --> 13:59.945
And it's not because they can't,

13:59.945 --> 14:02.517
it's the week that Abby put
the time, and the energy

14:02.517 --> 14:03.886
and the thought into it.

14:03.886 --> 14:05.523
ASHLEE:
She was totally
invested.
Yep.

14:05.523 --> 14:07.193
I don't know
what Abby's thinking.

14:07.193 --> 14:09.798
<i>We have a commercial dance</i>
<i>that films tomorrow,</i>

14:09.798 --> 14:12.403
<i>that she chose</i>
<i>not to be a part of.</i>

14:12.403 --> 14:14.575
And a group dance that
we haven't even started,

14:14.575 --> 14:16.077
with two new dancers.

14:16.077 --> 14:19.183
<i>That's a lot of choreography</i>
<i>for our girls to manage</i>

14:19.183 --> 14:21.522
and Abby's taking
her sweet, old time

14:21.522 --> 14:24.493
<i>with the minis,</i>
<i>like she's in Ballet 101.</i>

14:28.970 --> 14:30.673
ABBY LEE:
These are the two

14:30.673 --> 14:32.611
little ones
joining our group.

14:32.611 --> 14:34.080
This is Saryna...

14:34.080 --> 14:36.785
and this is Jayden.

14:36.785 --> 14:38.856
So, the number
is certainly

14:38.856 --> 14:40.158
a tribute
to Muhammad Ali.

14:40.158 --> 14:41.427
I know that you know he died

14:41.427 --> 14:43.231
because it's all over
social media. However,

14:43.231 --> 14:45.903
he was so confident,

14:45.903 --> 14:47.507
saying "I'm the greatest."

14:47.507 --> 14:49.310
And I think sometimes
you guys need

14:49.310 --> 14:51.314
a little bit more
Muhammad Ali.

14:51.314 --> 14:52.550
A little bit more,

14:52.550 --> 14:54.253
"I can go out there
and be the best performer

14:54.253 --> 14:55.590
on this stage today."

14:55.590 --> 14:56.825
HOLLY:
I love it.
That's a nice tribute.

14:56.825 --> 14:58.061
HOLLY:
It's a great tribute.

14:58.061 --> 14:59.598
ABBY LEE: All right.
I don't want to waste

14:59.598 --> 15:00.967
any more of your time 'cause
you have one day to do this.

15:00.967 --> 15:02.136
So, girls, get in there...

15:02.136 --> 15:03.405
Think like champions.

15:04.407 --> 15:06.244

15:06.244 --> 15:08.081
<i>everything into this dance.</i>

15:08.081 --> 15:10.787
<i>I want it to be synonymous</i>
<i>with Muhammad Ali.</i>

15:10.787 --> 15:14.026
This was a man that was
so grand, and had such

15:14.026 --> 15:16.130
<i>stature in the ring,</i>

15:16.130 --> 15:17.701
that nobody could
even touch him.

15:17.701 --> 15:19.136
He was the greatest.

15:19.136 --> 15:20.673

Girls. Boxing number.

15:23.779 --> 15:25.683
You are "The Champs."

15:25.683 --> 15:27.353
If we go to
a competition

15:27.353 --> 15:29.791
and enter a number called "The
Champs," and it doesn't win,

15:29.791 --> 15:31.160
