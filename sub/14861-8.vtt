WEBVTT

00:01.372 --> 00:03.634
WILL! HIDE ME!HIDE ME!

00:03.634 --> 00:05.336
HE--HE'S GOT A DART!

00:05.336 --> 00:06.507
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
WHO'S GOT A DART?

00:06.507 --> 00:07.778
AAH!
YOU THINK IT'S FUNNY, KENNY?!

00:07.778 --> 00:09.140
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

00:09.140 --> 00:10.481
I'M GETTING A CUP OF COFFEE.

00:10.481 --> 00:12.643
ALL OF A SUDDEN,
I HEAR THIS IDIOT YELL,

00:12.643 --> 00:14.645
"DART ATTACK!
DON'T LOOK UP!"

00:14.645 --> 00:16.247
SO I LOOK UP...
IN SPITE OF MY INSTRUCTIONS!

00:16.247 --> 00:18.018
AND HE HITS ME IN THE FOREHEAD
WITH A DART!

00:18.018 --> 00:21.152
OKAY, IN MY DEFENSE, I HAD
A VERY TOUGH DAY YESTERDAY,

00:21.152 --> 00:22.793
AND I'M TAKING IT OUT
ON CRAIG.

00:22.793 --> 00:24.495
OH, NO! ARE YOU OKAY?

00:24.495 --> 00:25.656
WHY DON'T YOU STEP OUT
FROM BEHIND WILL

00:25.656 --> 00:27.628
AND TELL US ALL ABOUT IT?
HEY, HEY, CRAIG.

00:27.628 --> 00:28.699
WILL--
NO.

00:28.699 --> 00:29.700
BUT--
NO!

00:29.700 --> 00:32.333
(sighs) FINE.

00:32.333 --> 00:35.506
NOW WHAT'S GOING ON,
KENNY?

00:35.506 --> 00:37.138
YESTERDAY, I'M AT THE PARK.

00:37.138 --> 00:40.241
I'M TEACHING NATHAN SOME
OF MY AWESOME FOOTBALL SKILLS,

00:40.241 --> 00:41.572
AND THEN GRANT SHOWS UP
UNINVITED,

00:41.572 --> 00:43.244
TOTALLY CONFUSES THE KID.

00:43.244 --> 00:45.676
HIKE!

00:45.676 --> 00:47.548
YAH! UHH!

00:47.548 --> 00:49.580
AAH! HA!

00:49.580 --> 00:51.722
GIVE ME THAT! STOP IT!
AAH! UHH!

00:51.722 --> 00:54.155
AAH! OHH!

00:54.155 --> 00:55.426
UHH!

00:55.426 --> 00:56.757
MAN, I AM SICK

00:56.757 --> 00:58.289
OF GRANT BEING BETTER THAN ME
AT EVERYTHING--

00:58.289 --> 01:00.231
SPORTS, REGIONAL COOKING--

01:00.231 --> 01:01.492
HAVING SEX WITH YOUR EX-WIFE.

01:01.492 --> 01:03.664
I ASSUME.

01:03.664 --> 01:06.297
SO... I CAN'T HELP MY NEPHEW
ANYMORE.

01:06.297 --> 01:08.169
IS THERE SOMETHING
THAT I CAN TEACH MY NIECE?

01:08.169 --> 01:10.801
SHE'S ONLY 7. I KNOW SHE CAN'T
MAKE A GOOD MARGARITA YET.

01:10.801 --> 01:12.343
ACTUALLY, LUCY'S GOOD.

01:12.343 --> 01:14.775
SHE'S VERY EXCITED BECAUSE
WE JUST TOLD HER THAT SHE'S--

01:14.775 --> 01:15.846
PART ROBOT?
A FIRESTARTER?

01:15.846 --> 01:17.208
AGING BACKWARDS?
MADE OF COPPER?

01:17.208 --> 01:18.209
A DOG WHISPERER?

01:18.209 --> 01:20.181
EVEN THOUGH WE'RE FIGHTING,
WE STILL GOT IT.

01:20.181 --> 01:22.313
(laughing)

01:22.313 --> 01:24.485
WE'RE GETTING LUCY
A CHICKEN.

01:24.485 --> 01:26.487
SHE HAS NO IDEA
WHERE FOOD COMES FROM.

01:26.487 --> 01:28.419
THE OTHER DAY, SHE ASKED
IF BACON, LETTUCE, AND TOMATO

01:28.419 --> 01:30.161
ALL CAME FROM THE SAME PLANT.

01:30.161 --> 01:32.163
(snaps fingers)
WAIT, THERE'S A TRICK
FOR REMEMBERING THIS.

01:32.163 --> 01:34.125
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR SOMETHING
THAT SHE AND I CAN DO TOGETHER.

01:34.125 --> 01:37.128
YOU KNOW, A WAY FOR US TO
CONNECT AS FATHER AND DAUGHTER.

01:37.128 --> 01:39.230
WELL, IF PEOPLE ARE GETTIN'
CHICKENS, I'M IN.

01:39.230 --> 01:40.201
ME, TOO.

01:40.201 --> 01:42.303
I'M GONNA NAME MINE
"EGGS BENEDICT."

01:42.303 --> 01:45.276
WHY? IS HE GONNA BETRAY AMERICA
AND SELL US OUT TO THE BRITISH?

01:45.276 --> 01:46.877
MAYBE. WE'LL SEE HOW TRAINABLE
IT IS.

01:46.877 --> 01:49.140
BY THE WAY, WHILE WE WERE
TALKING, THIS CAME FOR YOU.

01:49.140 --> 01:50.110
(squish)
MOTHER!

01:50.110 --> 01:51.482
AAH! AAH!

01:56.487 --> 01:58.389
(cereal rattles)

01:58.389 --> 02:01.452
I'M SORRY I WAS SO MUCH BIGGER
THAN YOU YESTERDAY.

02:01.452 --> 02:03.354
THAT'S OKAY. I'M SORRY
I HURT YOUR ANKLE

02:03.354 --> 02:05.226
WHEN YOU STEPPED
ON MY FACE.

02:05.226 --> 02:06.427
(door opens)

02:06.427 --> 02:07.798
HELLO, EVERYONE.

02:07.798 --> 02:09.360
BRENDA, I WOULD LIKE
TO THANK YOU

02:09.360 --> 02:11.462
FOR SETTING ME UP
WITH YOUR DOCTOR FRIEND.

02:11.462 --> 02:13.204
SHE RAN SOME TESTS
AND HAS IDENTIFIED ME

02:13.204 --> 02:14.635
AS HER PERFECT BONE DONOR.

02:14.635 --> 02:15.806
OHH!
(Brenda) OH! (chuckles)

02:15.806 --> 02:17.168
(chuckles) THE KIDS AREN'T
AROUND, ARE THEY?

02:17.168 --> 02:21.242
(singsongy) DR. DONNA
DEFINITELY HAS YOU ON HER MIND.

02:21.242 --> 02:24.175
THE OTHER DAY SHE TOLD
A BUNCH OF US NURSES THAT

02:24.175 --> 02:27.548
A PATIENT OF HERS WAS GOING
TO DIE IN A MATTER OF "CRAIGS."

02:27.548 --> 02:28.649
(laughs)

02:28.649 --> 02:30.181
(laughs) IT WAS SO FUNNY...

02:30.181 --> 02:32.483
AND THEN SAD,
BECAUSE SHE MEANT HOURS.

02:32.483 --> 02:34.585
HMM. SHE WANTS ME TO MEET
HER SON.

02:34.585 --> 02:35.886
THAT'S A GOOD SIGN.

02:35.886 --> 02:38.589
I KNOW. IT'S GREAT.
KIDS LOVE ME, AND I LOVE THEM.

02:38.589 --> 02:41.462
IN FACT, I CONSIDER MYSELF
A CONNOISSEUR OF CHILDREN.

02:41.462 --> 02:43.194
EASY, BUDDY.
THAT PHRASE IS WHAT LOST YOU

02:43.194 --> 02:44.195
THE SANTA JOB AT THE MALL.

02:44.195 --> 02:45.896
(Theresa)
WHOA. YOU'RE ALL HERE.

02:45.896 --> 02:48.439
(Kenny crunches cereal)
IT'S 6:30 IN THE MORNING.

02:48.439 --> 02:49.900
LUCY ISN'T EVEN AWAKE YET.

02:49.900 --> 02:51.672
WE'RE ALL VERY EAGER ABOUT
THE CHICKENS.
(chuckles)

02:51.672 --> 02:53.244
I WENT ONLINE AND DID
SOME RESEARCH.

02:53.244 --> 02:56.347
DID YOU KNOW THAT ALTHOUGH
CHICKENS WALK ON TWO FEET,

02:56.347 --> 02:58.279
TECHNICALLY THEY'RE NOT
CONSIDERED MAMMALS.

02:58.279 --> 03:00.251
I JUST WANT
TO ENCOURAGE ALL OF YOU

03:00.251 --> 03:01.752
TO RECONSIDER
THIS MADNESS...

03:01.752 --> 03:03.714
(mug clatters)
ALL RIGHT?
CHICKENS ARE A LOT OF WORK.

03:03.714 --> 03:05.756
AH, YOU JUST DON'T LIKE
CHICKENS,

03:05.756 --> 03:08.359
BECAUSE WHEN WE USED TO STAY
AT GRANDPA'S FARM,

03:08.359 --> 03:10.261
THEY'D RAT YOU OUT WHEN YOU
TRIED TO SNEAK IN AFTER CURFEW.

03:10.261 --> 03:12.763
HONEY, THIS IS MY CHANCE
TO HAVE A TEACHABLE MOMENT

03:12.763 --> 03:15.766
WITH MY DAUGHTER.
BESIDES, IT'S JUST ONE BIRD...

03:15.766 --> 03:16.767
(Craig, Kenny, and Grant) HEY.

03:16.767 --> 03:18.469
FOR... EACH OF US,

03:18.469 --> 03:21.602
FOR A TOTAL OF FIVE
IN OUR BACKYARD,

03:21.602 --> 03:24.204
WHERE YOUR ZEN GARDEN USED
TO BE, WHICH, LET'S FACE IT,

03:24.204 --> 03:26.277
WAS REALLY JUST
A BUNCH OF ROCKS.

03:26.277 --> 03:28.779
(chuckles) I LOVE YOU.

03:28.779 --> 03:32.243
FINE. HAVE AT IT, BUT DON'T COME
CRYING TO ME IF THINGS GO WRONG,

03:32.243 --> 03:34.945
AND WITH CHICKENS,
THINGS WILL ALWAYS GO WRONG.

03:34.945 --> 03:38.389
WOW!
THERESA REALLY HATES POULTRY.

03:38.389 --> 03:40.391
WHEN WE WERE KIDS,
I ONCE SHOOK A BAG OF CHICKENS

03:40.391 --> 03:42.222
AND THREW 'EM IN THE TUB
WITH HER.

03:42.222 --> 03:45.526
I KINDA REGRET THAT NOW.
(crunching)

03:46.597 --> 03:49.600
(rooster crows)

03:49.600 --> 03:51.302
HAVE YOU PICKED ONE OUT YET,
SWEETIE?

03:51.302 --> 03:52.903
NEGATIVE.

03:52.903 --> 03:54.565
I WAS TALKING
TO MY OTHER SWEETIE.

03:54.565 --> 03:56.737
I'M STILL LOOKING, TOO.

03:56.737 --> 03:57.908
I'M TALKING TO MY DAUGHTER.

03:57.908 --> 03:59.570
WHY WOULD I CALL
ANY OF YOU GUYS "SWEETIE"?

03:59.570 --> 04:01.812
I ONCE HEARD YOU CALL CRAIG
"PUMPKIN."

04:01.812 --> 04:03.344
BECAUSE HE USED
THIS SPRAY TAN,

04:03.344 --> 04:05.646
AND I SAID HE WAS THE COLOR
OF PUMPKINS.

04:05.646 --> 04:06.717
YES?

04:06.717 --> 04:09.850
FINE, PUMPKIN,
SWEETIE, GRANT--

04:09.850 --> 04:11.322
I'M SORRY.
I DON'T HAVE A NICKNAME

04:11.322 --> 04:12.723
I'M NOT CALLING YOU YET.

04:12.723 --> 04:14.285
"HONEY BEAR."

04:14.285 --> 04:16.357
HAS ANYBODY HERE PICKED OUT
A CHICKEN YET?

04:16.357 --> 04:19.259
I WANT THAT CUTE ONE OVER THERE,
NEXT TO ALL THE OTHER CUTE ONES.

04:19.259 --> 04:20.731
I'M GONNA GO TELL THE LADY.

04:20.731 --> 04:24.965
I LIKE THAT LITTLE BITTY ONE.
SHE LOOKS LONELY.

04:24.965 --> 04:28.369
I'M GONNA GET THAT BIG ONE THAT
JUST DROPPED A CHICKEN DEUCE

04:28.369 --> 04:30.401
ON GRANT'S CHICKEN'S HEAD.

04:30.401 --> 04:32.503
SEEMS A LITTLE AGGRESSIVE FOR
A GUY WHO ANSWERS TO "SWEETIE."

04:32.503 --> 04:34.975
I'M NEVER GONNA BE BETTER
THAN GRANT AT ANYTHING,

04:34.975 --> 04:36.276
BUT AT LEAST I CAN HAVE
A CHICKEN

04:36.276 --> 04:38.008
THAT'S BETTER THAN HIS,

04:38.008 --> 04:40.351
AND THEN I WILL BE BETTER
THAN HIM.

04:40.351 --> 04:41.452
NO, I WON'T... (chuckles)

04:41.452 --> 04:45.456
BUT MY CHICKEN WILL BE,
AND SO WILL I.

04:45.456 --> 04:46.387
NO, I WON'T.

04:46.387 --> 04:47.888
JUST GET THE DAMN CHICKEN.

04:47.888 --> 04:49.720
RELAX, MAN. I WILL.

04:49.720 --> 04:52.663
YO. HOW MUCH ARE THE CHICKENS?

04:52.663 --> 04:53.664
$8.

04:53.664 --> 04:55.966
(chuckles)
$8? THAT IS INSANE.

04:55.966 --> 04:58.599
I CAN GET ONE WITH FRIES
AND A TOY FOR $4.

04:58.599 --> 05:01.702
I'LL GIVE YOU... 99 CENTS.

05:01.702 --> 05:03.804
I CAN GIVE YOU A DEAD ONE
FOR 99 CENTS.

05:03.804 --> 05:05.305
HOW DEAD?

05:05.305 --> 05:06.377
PRETTY DEAD.

05:06.377 --> 05:08.539
NO. THAT SOUNDS TOO DEAD.

05:08.539 --> 05:10.581
YOU JUST LOST A DEAL, SIR.

05:10.581 --> 05:13.384
COME ON.
THIS WHOLE PLACE IS A RACKET.

05:16.387 --> 05:18.088
I LOVE MY CHICKEN
SO MUCH, DADDY.
(clucking)

05:18.088 --> 05:21.452
GOOD. I LOVE THAT WE'RE
DOING THIS TOGETHER.

05:21.452 --> 05:22.993
I'M GONNA NAME HER
AFTER MY FAVORITE THING

05:22.993 --> 05:24.024
IN THE WHOLE WORLD.

05:24.024 --> 05:25.826
YEAH?

05:25.826 --> 05:27.658
"MOMMY."

05:27.658 --> 05:29.430
OH.

05:29.430 --> 05:33.003
IT MIGHT BE CONFUSING HAVING
TWO MOMMIES AROUND.

05:33.003 --> 05:35.335
THEN I'LL NAME HER AFTER
MY SECOND FAVORITE THING.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.838
WELL, IT MAY ALSO BE
CONFUSING HAVING TWO DA--

05:37.838 --> 05:40.871
COOKIES! I'M GONNA CALL HER
"COOKIE."

05:40.871 --> 05:45.015
MOM, I FIGURED OUT A NAME
FOR COOKIE! IT'S "COOKIE"!

05:45.015 --> 05:46.847
TOUGH BREAK, WILL. (sighs)

05:46.847 --> 05:50.350
THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE YOU
BOTH TIMES, DIDN'T YOU?

05:50.350 --> 05:52.122
(whispers) YEAH.

05:52.122 --> 05:55.956
OH, MAN. LOOK HOW BADASS
MY CHICKEN IS.

05:55.956 --> 05:58.358
HE JUST TOOK SEEDS AWAY
FROM YOUR NERD BIRD,

05:58.358 --> 06:00.761
AND YOURIDIOTDIDN'T
EVEN DO ANYTHING.

06:00.761 --> 06:03.594
THAT'S 'CAUSE HE'S CHICKEN.
BAH-GAH!

06:03.594 --> 06:06.096
LET ME HELP YOU WITH
THAT CHICKEN SOUND, KENNY.

06:06.096 --> 06:07.468
IT'S MORE LIKE, UH...

06:07.468 --> 06:08.399
(high-pitched voice)
BOK-BOK, BAH-GOK, BAH-GOK!

06:08.399 --> 06:10.370
BOK-BOK, BAH-GOK!

06:10.370 --> 06:12.573
FINE, ADD CHICKEN SOUNDS

06:12.573 --> 06:15.606
TO THINGS YOU'RE BETTER AT
THAN ME, BUT CAN YOU DO THIS?

06:15.606 --> 06:19.710
(inhales and roars)

06:19.710 --> 06:21.582
I CHOOSE NOT TO.

06:21.582 --> 06:24.384
THEN YOU WIN AGAIN, BECAUSE I
HAVE STRAINED MY THROAT.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.557
(doorbell rings)

06:26.557 --> 06:28.459
AW, FLOWERS.

06:28.459 --> 06:30.721
OKAY, I'LL HAVE SEX
WITH YOU.

06:30.721 --> 06:33.924
KIDDING. I WAS GONNA
DO THAT ANYWAY.

06:33.924 --> 06:37.468
I'M KIDDING AGAIN. IT DEPENDS
WHAT'S IN THAT GIFT BAG.

06:37.468 --> 06:38.729
WELL, THEN WE'RE
TOTALLY GONNA DO IT,

06:38.729 --> 06:41.502
BECAUSE I GOT SOMETHING
FOR YOUR SON.

06:41.502 --> 06:43.934
(gasps) OH.
WEAREGONNA DO IT.

06:43.934 --> 06:45.936
WELL, I WANT TO MAKE
A GOOD FIRST IMPRE--

06:45.936 --> 06:48.408
(squeaks)
OH!

06:48.408 --> 06:50.581
MILADY, SHALL WE PROCEED
WITH THE EVENING? (chuckles)

06:50.581 --> 06:53.584
SORRY. I GUESS I NEED
A MAT UNDER THAT THING.

06:53.584 --> 06:57.087
RANDY! SO YOU READY
TO MEET MY LITTLE GUY?

06:57.087 --> 06:58.589
(chuckles)
ALTHOUGH I DON'T KNOW
HOW MUCH LONGER

06:58.589 --> 07:00.190
I CAN CALL HIM THAT.
HE'S 11 ALREADY.

07:00.190 --> 07:01.452
(chuckles)

07:01.452 --> 07:03.524
(crunches)

07:03.524 --> 07:04.495
HEY, DUDE.

07:04.495 --> 07:05.496
HI.

07:05.496 --> 07:07.458
SO WHERE'S RANDY?

07:07.458 --> 07:09.199
THIS IS RANDY.
(crunches)

07:09.199 --> 07:10.501
THIS GENTLEMAN IS RANDY?

07:10.501 --> 07:12.563
HE'S A LITTLE BIG
FOR HIS AGE. (sighs)

07:12.563 --> 07:14.665
YEAH, HE'S A LITTLE BIG
FORMYAGE.

07:14.665 --> 07:17.468
SO,CRAIG, WHY DON'T YOU
AND MY FAVORITE GUY

07:17.468 --> 07:20.440
GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER, OKAY?

07:20.440 --> 07:23.544
(sighs)
HEY, BUDDY. (chuckles)

07:24.715 --> 07:27.848
OH, I, UH,
GOT YOU A GIFT.

07:30.020 --> 07:32.222
WELL... (chuckles)

07:32.222 --> 07:35.125
MAYBE YOU CAN GIVE IT
TO YOUR SON. (chuckles)

07:35.125 --> 07:36.456
DO YOU HAVE KIDS?

07:36.456 --> 07:39.129
NO. YOU WANNA WRESTLE?

07:39.129 --> 07:41.592
UM... NO, THANKS.
(chuckles)

07:41.592 --> 07:42.593
I DO.

07:42.593 --> 07:44.464
MAYBE WITH OUR THUMBS.

07:44.464 --> 07:46.066
OHH!
(thud)

07:46.066 --> 07:48.639
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME RANDY
WAS AN 11-YEAR-OLD YETI?

07:48.639 --> 07:51.071
OR THAT THE WORLD SHAKES
WHEN HE WALKS?

07:51.071 --> 07:53.003
OR THAT HIS BED IS SURROUNDED
BY THE BONES OF ENGLISHMEN?

07:53.003 --> 07:54.975
CRAIG, SOMETIMES YOU GOTTA BE
FIRM WITH CHILDREN.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.476
YOU PUT YOUR FOOT DOWN.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.649
HARD TO PUT MY FOOT DOWN
WHEN I'M BEING CARRIED AROUND

07:58.649 --> 08:00.951
BY JUST THE SKIN
ON MY STOMACH.

08:00.951 --> 08:02.212
BESIDES, I NEED TO BE CAREFUL
ABOUT GETTING

08:02.212 --> 08:03.213
INTO A CONFRONTATION.

08:03.213 --> 08:04.515
WHY?

08:04.515 --> 08:05.686
I HAVE SOME ANGER ISSUES.

08:05.686 --> 08:09.620
ONCE I OPEN THAT DOOR,
THINGS CAN GET A LITTLE SCARY.

08:09.620 --> 08:13.864
YOUGET SCARY? YOU MEAN,
LIKE HOW A CUPCAKE GETS SCARY?

08:13.864 --> 08:15.996
OR A KITTEN SLEEPING
IN WARM LAUNDRY?

08:15.996 --> 08:17.968
OH, HE'S SERIOUS.

08:17.968 --> 08:19.800
CRAIG DOES NOT DO WELL
WHEN HE'S PUSHED TO THE LIMIT

08:19.800 --> 08:22.633
AND HAS TO STAND UP
FOR HIMSELF.

08:22.633 --> 08:25.636
(high-pitched screaming)

08:29.239 --> 08:31.011
MY COUPON HAD NOT EXPIRED.

08:31.011 --> 08:34.184
(sighs) ALTHOUGH IT DID BY
THE TIME THAT TANTRUM WAS OVER.

08:34.184 --> 08:35.616
IF YOU CAN'T TALK
TO THE KID,

08:35.616 --> 08:37.588
WHY DON'T YOU JUST SAY
SOMETHING TO DONNA?

08:37.588 --> 08:39.620
BECAUSE YOU DO NOT GET
A WOMAN IN THE MOOD FOR SEX

08:39.620 --> 08:42.893
BY TELLING HER THAT HER SON IS
A MISBEGOTTEN LAND MONSTER.

08:42.893 --> 08:44.855
LOOK, I FOUND AN EGG!

08:44.855 --> 08:48.058
(gasps)
THAT'S GREAT, HONEY!

08:48.058 --> 08:50.200
NOW TELL MOMMY
WHERE EGGS COME FROM.

08:50.200 --> 08:54.565
CHICKEN'S BUTTS.
I'M GONNA GO LOOK FOR MORE.

08:54.565 --> 08:57.568
WHAT A WONDERFUL
TEACHABLE MOMENT THAT WAS.

08:57.568 --> 09:00.240
LOOK HOW I'VE ENRICHED
MY DAUGHTER'S LIFE.

09:00.240 --> 09:03.944
HELLO, YOU LITTLE MIRACLE.
MWAH.

09:03.944 --> 09:06.717
YOU KNOW, THAT REALLY DID JUST
DROP OUT OF A CHICKEN'S BUTT.

09:06.717 --> 09:09.049
(spits)

09:09.049 --> 09:10.821
(grunts)

09:10.821 --> 09:14.284
(clucking)
CHECK OUT HOW MY XENA'S PUSHING
HER TAIL INTO YOUR CHICKEN,

09:14.284 --> 09:15.726
TOTALLY DISRESPECTING HER.

09:15.726 --> 09:18.589
(laughs)
YOUR CHICKEN'S BEENDISSED.

09:18.589 --> 09:21.561
LOOK HOW PETTY YOU'RE BEING.
THAT CAN'T FEEL GOOD.

09:21.561 --> 09:24.164
OH, YOU'D BE SURPRISED.

09:24.164 --> 09:27.567
WAIT.
WHAT IS YOUR CHICKEN DOING?

09:27.567 --> 09:30.601
WHY IS SHE CLIMBING UP
ON XENA?
(Xena squawking)

09:30.601 --> 09:33.343
I DON'T THINK MY BIRD'S
ASHE.

09:33.343 --> 09:35.245
MAN, THAT LITTLE SUCKER'S
IN A HURRY.

09:35.245 --> 09:37.077
(high-pitched squawks)

09:37.077 --> 09:39.780
(rooster crows)

09:39.780 --> 09:41.612
(Kenny)
GRANT'S HEN IS A ROOSTER!

09:41.612 --> 09:44.855
HE DEFLOWERED XENA
WITH BRUTAL INDIFFERENCE.

09:44.855 --> 09:47.587
YOU'RE RUNNING A FRAT HOUSE
OUT THERE, WILLIAM!

09:47.587 --> 09:49.589
WHOA, KENNY. SLOW DOWN.
FROM WHERE I WAS STANDING,

09:49.589 --> 09:51.822
IT LOOKED LIKE EVERYBODY
WAS GETTING WHAT THEY WANTED.

09:51.822 --> 09:53.924
(scoffs) SHE'S 6 WEEKS OLD.

09:53.924 --> 09:57.898
SHE CAN'T MAKE A DECISION
LIKE THAT. OHH.

09:59.269 --> 10:00.871
KENNY!
UGH.

10:00.871 --> 10:04.735
SOMETHING'S WRONG WITH COOKIE.
SHE WON'T STAND UP.

10:04.735 --> 10:08.809
SHE NEEDS A DOCTOR.
CALL 9-1-1!

10:08.809 --> 10:10.110
(sighs)

10:10.110 --> 10:12.282
SO THERE ARE COMPLICATIONS
IN RAISING FARM ANIMALS.

10:12.282 --> 10:13.613
WHEW.

10:13.613 --> 10:16.016
WHO COULD HAVE SEEN
THAT COMING?

10:21.952 --> 10:23.123
DON'T WORRY, HONEY.

10:23.123 --> 10:25.295
I'M SURE COOKIE'S GONNA BE
JUST FINE.

10:25.295 --> 10:28.999
THE VETERINARIAN PROBABLY SEES
THIS KIND OF THING ALL THE TIME.

10:28.999 --> 10:33.003
WELL, I'VE NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE.

10:33.003 --> 10:36.006
LOOK HOW SPECIAL COOKIE IS.

10:36.006 --> 10:39.339
COOKIE APPEARS TO HAVE
AN IMPACTED CROP,

10:39.339 --> 10:42.142
WHICH IS STOPPING FOOD
FROM GETTING INTO HER STOMACH.

10:42.142 --> 10:43.674
CAN YOU HELP HER?

10:43.674 --> 10:46.216
I COULD, BUT IT WOULD
REQUIRE SURGERY.

10:46.216 --> 10:48.819
SURGERY? ON A CHICKEN?

10:48.819 --> 10:51.421
I KNOW, RIGHT? (chuckles)
WHO DOES THAT?

10:51.421 --> 10:52.683
WE DO.
(sighs)

10:52.683 --> 10:54.054
RIGHT, DADDY?

10:54.054 --> 10:56.927
WE DON'T KNOW YET.

10:56.927 --> 11:01.391
HOW MUCH WOULD WE BE PAYING
FOR SUCH AN ASININE ACTIVITY?

11:01.391 --> 11:05.235
$700? TO SAVE A CHICKEN?

11:05.235 --> 11:09.239
MAYBE IF IT COULD PREDICT
THE FUTURE OR GRANT WISHES

11:09.239 --> 11:12.703
OR EVEN DRIVE ME TO THE AIRPORT,
BUT THIS BIRD'S GOING NOWHERE.

11:12.703 --> 11:14.374
IF THAT'S YOUR CRITERIA
FOR SAVING THINGS,

11:14.374 --> 11:16.346
THEN WE WOULD NEVER SAVE
KENNY, EITHER.

11:16.346 --> 11:19.049
EXCUSE ME.
I NEED TO WASH MY HANDS.

11:19.049 --> 11:20.981
(chuckles) UH, BIRDS AREN'T SHY
ABOUT WHERE THEY POOP.

11:20.981 --> 11:22.182
(mouths word)

11:22.182 --> 11:25.455
UH, HERE'S AN IDEA.
YOU KNOW, MAYBE I HAVE, UH,

11:25.455 --> 11:27.687
A DIFFERENT TEACHABLE MOMENT
WITH LUCY.
(water running in sink)

11:27.687 --> 11:31.892
MAYBE I TEACH HER
THAT SOMETIMES THINGS DIE.

11:31.892 --> 11:34.394
WILL, YOU LET HER NAME COOKIE
AFTER HER SECOND FAVORITE THING.

11:34.394 --> 11:36.927
IT'S GONNA BE HARD FOR HER
TO LET IT GO.

11:36.927 --> 11:39.830
IF I MAY, WHEN I WAS A BOY
AND WE LOST MY PEE-PAW,

11:39.830 --> 11:42.032
MY BEE-BA READ ME
THE STORY OF BUN-BUN.

11:42.032 --> 11:44.074
DID YOU JUST GET
ELECTROCUTED?

11:44.074 --> 11:45.736
"BUN-BUN'S LAST HOP"
IS A CHILDREN'S BOOK

11:45.736 --> 11:47.738
ABOUT A LITTLE BUNNY
THAT DIES.

11:47.738 --> 11:50.410
IT TEACHES KIDS
HOW TO DEAL WITH LOSS

11:50.410 --> 11:53.213
AND THAT A TRACTOR'S ENGINE
IS NO PLACE TO HIDE.

11:53.213 --> 11:55.015
BUN-BUN, HUH?

11:55.015 --> 11:56.716
AH.
(sighs)

11:56.716 --> 11:59.419
I THINK THIS MOMENT JUST GOT
A LITTLE MORE TEACHABLE.

11:59.419 --> 12:02.452
OH, GRANT?
WE HAVE A SITUATION.

12:02.452 --> 12:06.757
XENA LAID HER FIRST EGG
SINCE THEINCIDENT,

12:06.757 --> 12:09.229
AND YOU AND I NEED TO TALK.

12:14.464 --> 12:17.137
IT'S POSITIVE. (sighs)

12:17.137 --> 12:18.438
ARE YOU SURE?

12:18.438 --> 12:20.440
OF COURSE I'M SURE.
I CHECKED IT THREE TIMES.

12:20.440 --> 12:24.314
THERE'S A SPOT INSIDE. (sighs)
IT'S FERTILIZED. WE'RE PREGNANT.

12:24.314 --> 12:25.946
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

12:25.946 --> 12:27.277
WHAT AMIGOING TO DO?

12:27.277 --> 12:28.448
I TELL YOU WE'RE GONNA HAVE
A CHICKEN,

12:28.448 --> 12:30.781
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU SAY
TO ME?

12:30.781 --> 12:33.053
JUST GET OUT.
WE DON'T NEED YOU.

12:33.053 --> 12:34.424
WELL, HOW DO WE EVEN KNOW
FOR SURE IT WAS MY BIRD

12:34.424 --> 12:36.056
WHO GOT YOUR B--
DON'T.

12:36.056 --> 12:38.188
DON'T YOU DARE.

12:38.188 --> 12:40.330
OH, I CAN'T EVEN LOOK
AT YOU.

12:41.962 --> 12:44.494
KENNY, I'M SORRY.
THIS IS ALL HAPPENING SO FAST.

12:44.494 --> 12:47.137
I'M JUST TRYING TO WRAP
MY HEAD AROUND IT.

12:49.139 --> 12:51.541
(sighs)

12:51.541 --> 12:53.543
I NEED TO KNOW THAT
YOU'RE GOING TO BE THERE

12:53.543 --> 12:55.806
FOR THIS CHICKEN'S WHOLE...

12:55.806 --> 12:58.809
I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW LONG
THEY LIVE. A COUPLE YEARS?

12:58.809 --> 13:01.281
I WILL BE THERE. I PROMISE.

13:01.281 --> 13:02.452
SO YOU'RE EXCITED?

13:02.452 --> 13:03.914
(chuckles) I AM EXCITED.

13:03.914 --> 13:05.515
THERE'S SO MUCH TO DO.
(chuckles)

13:05.515 --> 13:08.819
WE GOTTA GET AN INCUBATOR,
A LIGHT, MAYBE.

13:08.819 --> 13:11.791
DAMN IT, WE'RE HAVING
A CHICKEN TOGETHER! (laughs)

13:11.791 --> 13:14.424
SO INSTEAD OF WRESTLING,
I THOUGHT I WOULD ENTERTAIN YOU

13:14.424 --> 13:17.097
THIS EVENING WITH...
(whispers) THE ART OF ILLUSION.

13:17.097 --> 13:18.528
WHERE IS MY MOM?

13:18.528 --> 13:20.831
SHE HAD TO WORK LATE, AND SHE
ASKED ME TO LOOK AFTER YOU,

13:20.831 --> 13:24.975
AND I AGREED BECAUSE I WANTED
TO SHOW YOU THE ART OF ILLUSION.

13:24.975 --> 13:26.406
HOW LONG CAN YOU HOLD
YOUR BREATH?

13:26.406 --> 13:27.477
I DON'T KNOW... (chuckles)

13:27.477 --> 13:29.009
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT DOING
THAT RIGHT NOW.

13:29.009 --> 13:31.111
WE ARE DOING THE ART--

13:31.111 --> 13:33.583
RANDY. RANDY. PLEASE, RAN--

13:33.583 --> 13:36.486
(high-pitched, muffled voice)
RANDY! MM! MM!

13:36.486 --> 13:39.349
MM!
(objects clatter)

13:39.349 --> 13:41.191
(squeals)

13:49.459 --> 13:51.862
(video game playing)
HEY.

13:51.862 --> 13:55.365
YOU'RE THE GIANT DUDE.
WHERE'S CRAIG?

13:55.365 --> 13:57.437
(muffled voice)
I'M IN HERE!

13:57.437 --> 14:00.510
WHOA.
IS THIS PART OF YOUR MAGIC SHOW?

14:00.510 --> 14:02.842
BECAUSE IF I OPEN THIS
AND DOVES FLY OUT

14:02.842 --> 14:04.114
AND THEN YOU COME
THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR...

14:04.114 --> 14:05.946
(chuckles)
I WOULD LOSE MY MIND.

14:05.946 --> 14:07.277
OPEN IT!

14:07.277 --> 14:08.278
OKAY.

14:08.278 --> 14:11.621
(chuckles) HO! ♪ TA-DA ♪

14:11.621 --> 14:14.384
THAT TRICK NEEDS
A BETTER FINISH, MAN,

14:14.384 --> 14:15.525
OR AT LEAST THE "TRICK" PART.

14:15.525 --> 14:18.858
(panting)
THIS BEAST CHOKED ME OUT

14:18.858 --> 14:21.131
AND TIED ME UP
IN THIS GIANT HOBO SACK.

14:21.131 --> 14:23.063
I THINK THE WORD
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IS "BINDLE,"

14:23.063 --> 14:25.135
BECAUSE TECHNICALLY,
A "HOBO SACK"

14:25.135 --> 14:26.396
IS A DRIFTER'S UNDER-PACKAGE.

14:26.396 --> 14:27.467
(doorbell rings)

14:27.467 --> 14:29.900
THAT'S DONNA. I'VE HAD IT.

14:29.900 --> 14:34.574
I HAVE TO TELL HER THAT HER SON
IS A VIOLENT, ABUSIVE ANIMAL.

14:34.574 --> 14:37.077
THIS STOPS NOW. DONNA--

14:37.077 --> 14:38.909
MMM.

14:39.950 --> 14:42.382
RANDY'S SPENDING THE WEEKEND
WITH HIS FATHER,

14:42.382 --> 14:45.215
SO YOU AND I ARE GONNA
DO IT SO MUCH...

14:45.215 --> 14:47.487
(whispers)
OUR SOULS WILL SWITCH.

14:47.487 --> 14:49.920
OH, MY GOD.
SEXY SOUL-SWITCH.

14:49.920 --> 14:51.161
HAVE YOU BEEN READING
MY JOURNAL?

14:51.161 --> 14:54.564
(chuckles)

14:54.564 --> 14:57.627
"BUN-BUN'S FRIENDS WOULD DO
ANYTHING TO BRING BUN-BUN BACK,

14:57.627 --> 15:02.432
"GIVE UP ALL THEIR CARROTS,
EVEN THEIR WHISKERS,

15:02.432 --> 15:06.336
"BUT IT WAS TOO LATE,
BECAUSE DEATH IS FINAL,

15:06.336 --> 15:09.339
AND EVERYONE WILL
EXPERIENCE IT."

15:12.943 --> 15:15.085
WOW. THAT'S--THAT'S
A PRETTY HARSH ENDING.

15:15.085 --> 15:19.619
SO BUN-BUN'S FRIENDS WOULD HAVE
DONE ANYTHING TO SAVE HIM?

15:19.619 --> 15:23.453
YES, BUT WHAT THE BOOK'S TRYING
TO SAY IS THAT ANIMALS DIE,

15:23.453 --> 15:25.295
AND THAT'S JUST
A NATURAL PART OF THE--

15:25.295 --> 15:28.358
BUT WE CAN SAVE COOKIE.
THE DOCTOR SAID SO.

15:28.358 --> 15:30.360
WAIT.

15:30.360 --> 15:31.631
(pages rustle)
BUN-BUN ONLY DIED

15:31.631 --> 15:33.933
BECAUSE AFTER STARTING
THE TRACTOR ENGINE,

15:33.933 --> 15:35.605
THERE WEREN'T ENOUGH
OF HIS PARTS LEFT

15:35.605 --> 15:37.607
TO PUT HIM BACK TOGETHER.

15:37.607 --> 15:39.639
O-OKAY. LET'S READ THIS
AGAIN FROM--

15:39.639 --> 15:41.541
FROM THE FARMER'S POINT
OF VIEW,

15:41.541 --> 15:43.643
FOCUSING ON HOW MUCH
IT MUST HAVE COST HIM

15:43.643 --> 15:46.646
TO FIX HIS TRACTOR.

15:51.351 --> 15:53.553
SO YOU LET THIS BOY SUFFOCATE
YOU UNTIL YOU PASSED OUT?

15:53.553 --> 15:55.986
I DIDN'TLETHIM. IN FACT,
I FOUND SOMETHING THAT LOOKED

15:55.986 --> 15:58.989
LIKE FLESH UNDER MY FINGERNAILS,
SO I DEFINITELY STRUGGLED.

15:58.989 --> 16:01.331
CRAIG, YOU HAVE GOT TO BE
MORE ASSERTIVE WITH THIS KID.

16:01.331 --> 16:02.632
I DON'T WANT TO FREAK YOU OUT,
BUT NANCY PALMER SAW HIM

16:02.632 --> 16:05.435
PULLING YOU AROUND
THE NEIGHBORHOOD IN A WAGON.

16:05.435 --> 16:07.437
I TOLD YOU SOMEONE WAS
USING OUR WAGON.

16:07.437 --> 16:09.739
(sighs) NO, I-I CAN'T BE
ASSERTIVE.

16:09.739 --> 16:11.101
IF I DON'T KEEP A LID
ON MY ANGER,

16:11.101 --> 16:13.443
THINGS CAN GET UGLY
VERY QUICKLY.

16:13.443 --> 16:14.444
REMEMBER WHEN YOU ATE
THAT HOLIDAY CHEESE

16:14.444 --> 16:16.346
MY GRANDMA SENT ME?

16:16.346 --> 16:19.479
(high-pitched screaming)

16:19.479 --> 16:22.982
NOBODY GETS TO EAT
MY GRANDMA'S...

16:22.982 --> 16:25.985
(screaming)

16:27.587 --> 16:30.460
YEAH, THAT REALLY HARSHED
OUR OPEN HOUSE.

16:30.460 --> 16:32.622
I'M LIKE THE HULK,
EXCEPT INSTEAD OF BEING CREATED

16:32.622 --> 16:35.025
BY GAMMA RAYS, I WAS CREATED
BY AN EMOTIONALLY DISTANT FATHER

16:35.025 --> 16:36.996
AND A MOTHER WHO TOLD ME
THAT GOD HATES CRYBABIES.

16:36.996 --> 16:39.199
(electricity crackles)
AAH!

16:39.199 --> 16:40.200
(grunts)
WHAT HAPPENED?

16:40.200 --> 16:41.471
IT SHOCKED ME. NO BIGGIE.

16:41.471 --> 16:43.473
SO THIS IS YOUR INCUBATOR--
A 100-WATT BULB

16:43.473 --> 16:45.675
IN A CARDBOARD BOX FILLED
WITH STRAW?

16:45.675 --> 16:47.677
YOU TRYING TO HATCH THAT EGG
OR CREMATE IT?

16:47.677 --> 16:51.041
(laughs) THEY LAUGHED
AT BENJAMIN FRANKLIN

16:51.041 --> 16:54.414
WHEN HE INVENTED LIGHTNING,
BUT NOW IT POWERS ALL OUR HOMES.

16:54.414 --> 16:57.187
LOOK, I MADE US
AN INCUBATOR.

16:57.187 --> 16:58.648
I CARVED IT OUT OF DRIFTWOOD
I FOUND IN MALAYSIA

16:58.648 --> 17:03.653
AND ADDED VOLCANIC BLACK SAND
THAT I COLLECTED IN ICELAND.

17:03.653 --> 17:06.656
YEAH, WELL, DOES YOURS SHOCK YOU
LIGHTLY WHEN YOU TOUCH IT

17:06.656 --> 17:09.499
AND REMIND YOU
OF WHAT A FAILURE YOU ARE?

17:09.499 --> 17:12.162
OKAY, I GOT THE SURGERY
FOR THE BIRD.

17:12.162 --> 17:15.265
SHE'S ALL BETTER.
RIGHT, COOKIE?

17:15.265 --> 17:17.607
THAT'S NOT COOKIE.

17:17.607 --> 17:19.109
(clenches teeth)
SHUT UP. IT IS TOO COOKIE.

17:19.109 --> 17:20.740
NO. IT'S NOT.

17:20.740 --> 17:22.572
LOOK AT THE HIPS
ON THAT THING.

17:22.572 --> 17:25.175
DUDE,ILOOK MORE LIKE COOKIE
THAN THAT FATTY.

17:25.175 --> 17:26.676
SO THAT WAS YOUR PLAN,
TO TRY AND PASS

17:26.676 --> 17:28.148
ANOTHER BIRD OFF ON LUCY?

17:28.148 --> 17:31.381
NO, MY PLAN WAS TO TRY TO PASS
ANOTHER BIRD OFF ON EVERYBODY,

17:31.381 --> 17:32.522
BUT SINCE THAT FAILED,

17:32.522 --> 17:34.754
NOW IT'S JUST TO TRY
TO PASS HER OFF ON LUCY.

17:34.754 --> 17:39.229
AW, YOU BOUGHT A FRIEND
FOR COOKIE?

17:39.229 --> 17:42.462
WELL, ACTUALLY, SWEETIE...

17:43.833 --> 17:47.567
YES. I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE
A NICE SURPRISE FOR HER

17:47.567 --> 17:52.071
WHEN SHE GETS OUT
OF HER EXPENSIVE SURGERY.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.673
(mouths word)

17:53.673 --> 17:55.475
OKAY. OH. OH! UM...

17:55.475 --> 17:57.147
UH, CAT! CAT.

17:57.147 --> 17:58.678
NO, IT'S NOT CAT.

17:58.678 --> 17:59.609
(mouths word)

17:59.609 --> 18:01.581
OH. WHOA. OH, WHOA, WHOA.
TIGER!

18:01.581 --> 18:02.782
NO, IT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH FELINES.

18:02.782 --> 18:05.115
JUST... YOU KNOW?

18:05.115 --> 18:07.417
(mouths words)

18:07.417 --> 18:09.088
(timer bell dings)
OH. (sighs)

18:09.088 --> 18:11.691
(chuckles)
IT WAS "AMISTAD."

18:11.691 --> 18:14.264
HOW ON EARTH WAS THAT
"AMISTAD"?

18:14.264 --> 18:16.426
I WAS BEING A PIRATE,
LIKE, "ARR..."

18:16.426 --> 18:18.268
AND THEN "...MISTAD,"

18:18.268 --> 18:20.770
LIKE,
"ME STAND UP STRAIGHT."

18:20.770 --> 18:23.603
WELL, NOW THAT YOU EXPLAIN IT,
I-I KNOW IT'S NOT ME.

18:23.603 --> 18:27.207
(chuckles) OKAY. I'M GONNA GO,
UM, PUT TOGETHER SOME DESSERT.

18:27.207 --> 18:28.408
OH, NO, NO.
WE DON'T NEED DESSERT.

18:28.408 --> 18:30.480
LET'S PLAY AGAIN.
I-I'LL DO A CAT!

18:30.480 --> 18:32.612
YOU WANNA BOX?

18:32.612 --> 18:34.614
SURE, A BOX OF WHAT?
(chuckles)

18:34.614 --> 18:36.686
ROUND ONE.

18:36.686 --> 18:38.788
OH, THAT KIND OF BOX. YEAH.
UH, NO, RANDY.

18:38.788 --> 18:40.490
I'M NOT IN THE MOOD FOR--

18:40.490 --> 18:42.292
RANDY, PLEASE.
(chuckles) RANDY, PL--

18:42.292 --> 18:44.123
(squeaks)
WHOA. (grunts)

18:44.123 --> 18:47.857
(pants) NO! YOU CANNOT TREAT ME
LIKE THIS ANYMORE,

18:47.857 --> 18:50.500
AND I AM VERY ANGRY THAT
YOU WHEELED ME AROUND TOWN

18:50.500 --> 18:52.632
UNCONSCIOUS IN A WAGON!

18:52.632 --> 18:54.634
I AM IN MY LATE 30s!

18:54.634 --> 18:56.706
YOU ARE
A GIGANTIC, THOUGHTLESS,

18:56.706 --> 19:00.370
HUMONGOUS, OUT-OF-CONTROL,
GIANT BOY!

19:00.370 --> 19:03.142
CRAIG, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

19:03.142 --> 19:04.814
I'M SORRY, DONNA,
BUT YOUR SON HAS NO RESPECT

19:04.814 --> 19:07.577
FOR OTHER PEOPLE
OR THEIR NEED FOR OXYGEN

19:07.577 --> 19:08.778
OR WHICH WAY JOINTS BEND.

19:08.778 --> 19:10.820
DON'T TALK ABOUT RANDY
LIKE THAT.

19:10.820 --> 19:13.152
I WILL TALK ABOUT HIM LIKE THAT,
BECAUSE IT'S THE TRUTH,

19:13.152 --> 19:14.524
AND YOU NEED TO KNOW IT,

19:14.524 --> 19:15.755
AND I AM BEING ASSERTIVE
ABOUT THIS,

19:15.755 --> 19:18.157
AND I'M NOT LOSING MY MIND.

19:18.157 --> 19:19.729
WAIT.

19:19.729 --> 19:22.432
NO, I'M NOT. THERE.

19:22.432 --> 19:26.636
I HOPE YOU BOTH ENJOY DESSERT.

19:26.636 --> 19:28.438
(squeaks)
AAH! SHOOT!

19:28.438 --> 19:32.672
(high-pitched voice) GOD! GOD!
(shouting indistinctly)

19:32.672 --> 19:35.675
(screaming)

19:38.177 --> 19:39.679
(clucking)

19:39.679 --> 19:42.352
WELL, THAT'S $700
FOR THE SURGERY,

19:42.352 --> 19:44.554
PLUS $8 FOR COOKIE,

19:44.554 --> 19:46.586
ANOTHER $8 FOR FAKE COOKIE,

19:46.586 --> 19:48.588
$100 FOR
THE HEALTH INSURANCE POLICY

19:48.588 --> 19:49.959
THAT THEY TALKED ME INTO.

19:49.959 --> 19:52.622
THESE EGGS ARE GONNA BE
VERY PRICEY.

19:52.622 --> 19:54.364
OH, WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT EGGS.

19:54.364 --> 19:56.426
THE SURGERY DESTROYED
COOKIE'S OVIDUCT,

19:56.426 --> 19:58.698
SO SHE'LL BE LAYING
WHAT THE VET DESCRIBED

19:58.698 --> 20:00.800
AS SMALL, FETID PEBBLES.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.702
SO MUCH
FOR TEACHABLE MOMENTS.

20:02.702 --> 20:06.336
YEAH. MAYBE LUCY HAD A TEACHABLE
MOMENT FOR YOU INSTEAD.

20:06.336 --> 20:07.537
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

20:07.537 --> 20:10.540
WELL, YOU LEARNED THAT
WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT,

20:10.540 --> 20:13.212
YOU'LL DO ANYTHING TO MAKE
YOUR DAUGHTER HAPPY,

20:13.212 --> 20:15.815
AND THAT IS SWEET.

20:15.815 --> 20:18.788
YEAH. I SHOULD BE HIGHER
THAN HER FIFTH FAVORITE THING.

20:18.788 --> 20:20.990
I'M GONNA TRY TO MOVE UP
A NOTCH OR TWO.

20:20.990 --> 20:22.652
WHAT'S THREE AND FOUR,
ANYWAY?

20:22.652 --> 20:23.853
SALT AND PURPLE.

20:23.853 --> 20:25.825
OOH. THOSE ARE GOOD.

20:25.825 --> 20:27.997
MM.

20:31.901 --> 20:33.933
(chick cheeping, hens clucking)

20:33.933 --> 20:36.936
I GOTTA ADMIT, FOR A CHICKEN,
THAT THING'S PRETTY DAMN CUTE.

20:36.936 --> 20:38.908
I CAN ALREADY TELL I'M NOT GONNA
BE ABLE TO SAY NO TO IT.

20:38.908 --> 20:41.571
(Kenny) DID I MISS IT?!
DID I MISS IT?!

20:41.571 --> 20:44.444
DAMN IT! OF COURSE I DID!

20:44.444 --> 20:47.617
OHH! I BUILT
THE DEATH-TRAP INCUBATOR,

20:47.617 --> 20:48.948
AND THEN GRANT DELIVERS HER

20:48.948 --> 20:52.522
IN THE SAFETY
OF HIS MALAYSIAN VOLCANO BOX.

20:52.522 --> 20:54.554
HE'S BETTER THAN ME
AT EVERYTHING.

20:54.554 --> 20:56.025
THAT'S NOT TRUE, KENNY.

20:56.025 --> 20:58.528
I'M SURE YOU'RE BETTER
AT SOMETHING THAN--

20:58.528 --> 21:01.561
HEY, LOOK. GRANT'S CRYING.

21:01.561 --> 21:04.494
THIS--THIS IS JUST SUCH
A PERFECT MOMENT.

21:04.494 --> 21:06.366
(sighs)

21:06.366 --> 21:09.839
I CAN CRY.
I CAN CRY AS GOOD AS GRANT.

21:09.839 --> 21:12.642
I CAN CRY CIRCLES AROUND HIM!

21:12.642 --> 21:14.304
(imitates sob)

21:14.304 --> 21:17.477
(strained voice, grunts)

21:17.477 --> 21:20.950
(grunts loudly)

21:20.950 --> 21:22.982
UH-OH. I SHOULD GO.
