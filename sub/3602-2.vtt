Previously on Heroes.

00:04.755 --> 00:06.620
Five strangers
across the globe

00:06.716 --> 00:09.753
began to discover they had
extraordinary abilities.

00:10.511 --> 00:13.674
From the cheerleader who
realized she’s invincible...
Oh, my...

00:13.764 --> 00:15.846
I have busted like
every bone in my body

00:15.933 --> 00:17.514
yet I don't have
a scratch on me.

00:17.602 --> 00:21.060
...to the office worker who
can bend space and time.

00:21.898 --> 00:25.641
These strangers are
discovering they’re meant
for something more.

00:25.735 --> 00:30.570
Do you ever get the feeling
like you were meant to do
something extraordinary?

00:30.656 --> 00:34.865
And as a son
seeks the truth by
finishing his father’s work...

00:34.952 --> 00:36.533
I spoke to him
two days ago.

00:36.621 --> 00:38.452
He was this close
to finding
the first of them.

00:40.458 --> 00:44.542
He’s forced to run from a man
surrounded in mystery.

00:44.629 --> 00:46.290
He left everything behind
but his computer.

00:46.505 --> 00:51.169
A man who is more connected
than anyone imagined.

00:51.302 --> 00:54.590
Hi, Daddy.
Hey, baby.

00:54.931 --> 00:58.469
And now, Heroes continues.

MOHINDER: We all
imagine ourselves
the agents of our destiny,

01:04.106 --> 01:07.348
capable of determining
our own fate.

01:07.443 --> 01:10.150
But have we truly any choice
in when we rise?

01:10.696 --> 01:12.152
Or when we fall?

01:12.323 --> 01:16.657
Or does a force
larger than ourselves
bid us our direction?

01:17.036 --> 01:19.903
Is it evolution
that takes us by the hand?

01:19.997 --> 01:22.158
Does science point our way?

01:23.167 --> 01:27.251
Or is it God who intervenes,
keeping us safe?

01:34.762 --> 01:36.298
You're in a hospital.

01:37.181 --> 01:38.466
What happened?

01:40.726 --> 01:43.342
You don't remember?
No.

01:47.149 --> 01:48.525
You jumped, Pete.

01:49.819 --> 01:50.808
Jumped?

01:52.697 --> 01:55.404
Off the roof
of a 15-story building.

01:56.617 --> 01:58.403
You tried
to kill yourself.

01:59.787 --> 02:04.121
You were a little wound up
yesterday, but I thought
you were just being you.

02:04.208 --> 02:08.372
What are you talking about?
I didn't try to kill myself.

02:09.088 --> 02:13.252
You were in the alley
below. ljumped

02:13.342 --> 02:14.923
and you...

02:17.430 --> 02:18.715
You flew.

02:21.642 --> 02:24.258
I what?
You flew up
and you caught me.

02:24.895 --> 02:27.511
You jumped, Peter.

02:28.983 --> 02:31.440
Twenty-five feet
to a fire escape.

02:33.070 --> 02:36.107
I climbed up
and carried you down.
That's what happened.

02:38.951 --> 02:40.612
The rest is just
crazy talk.

02:41.579 --> 02:42.568
You understand?

03:09.065 --> 03:12.978
Dad? Do you mind if I talk
to you about something?

03:17.531 --> 03:20.022
You pregnant?
What? No.

03:20.117 --> 03:22.108

Dad.

03:23.412 --> 03:26.154
Actually,
I already know
what it's about.

03:27.833 --> 03:28.822
You do?

03:29.168 --> 03:30.704
It's about wanting to know
who you really are.

03:30.795 --> 03:33.878
Your mother told me
you've been asking
about your birth parents.

03:33.964 --> 03:35.579
Well, I think
it's time that I knew.

03:35.674 --> 03:37.710
Well, I have a few
questions first,

03:37.802 --> 03:39.588
not the least
of which is, why now?

03:39.678 --> 03:44.138
I'm just wondering, that's
all. You know, what they're
like, what they can do.

03:45.017 --> 03:50.307
What they can do?
Yeah,
like hobbies and skills.

03:54.485 --> 03:58.023
You know,
I don't mean this
to be condescending,

03:58.155 --> 03:59.736
even though you're going
to say I'm being
condescending,

03:59.824 --> 04:02.486
but I really do believe that
this is an adult decision.

04:02.576 --> 04:04.032
You're right.
That is condescending.

04:04.120 --> 04:05.656

04:21.846 --> 04:23.757

like cheerleading.

04:23.848 --> 04:27.932

is hard work. Hard,
treacherous work.

16:49.050 --> 16:50.586
It's a true
first edition.

16:51.178 --> 16:53.920
I work at this antique
book store,
and I found a copy.

16:54.014 --> 16:57.177
And ljust thought
he'd get a kick
out of reading it.

16:57.267 --> 17:01.727
Oh, he most definitely would
have gotten a kick out of it.
That's very thoughtful.

17:02.814 --> 17:04.930
You know, he told me
he was being watched.

17:06.193 --> 17:08.149
I thought that he was
just eccentric.

17:08.945 --> 17:11.732
I like that you didn't
use the word paranoid.

17:12.657 --> 17:14.488
Do you think that they're
watching you now?

17:14.576 --> 17:17.693
They could have killed me
if that's what they wanted.

17:17.787 --> 17:21.075
For the time being
it seems I'm more important
to them alive.

17:21.458 --> 17:24.200
You said that he talked
to you about his theories
and the map.

17:24.294 --> 17:28.287
I need you to tell me
everything he said to you,
everything you remember.

17:28.632 --> 17:29.747
Everything.

17:31.134 --> 17:36.049
Girls, this isn't
a criminal investigation.

17:36.389 --> 17:38.380
Nobody here is in
any kind of trouble.

17:38.475 --> 17:42.218
Quite the contrary,
there just happens
to be a very grateful man

like thank one of you for
saving his life yesterday.

17:47.817 --> 17:49.944
I've never seen
anyone so reluctant
to be called a hero.

17:50.028 --> 17:51.814
You're sure it was one
of our cheerleaders?

17:51.905 --> 17:54.692
The uniform said
Union Wells High.

17:55.909 --> 17:58.150
I'd have to say it was...

18:00.080 --> 18:01.570
Her on the end.

18:02.874 --> 18:04.410
That's Claire Bennet.

18:04.501 --> 18:09.245
Claire, where
did you go yesterday
after cheerleading practice?

18:10.507 --> 18:12.714
l, uh...
It wasn't her.

18:13.343 --> 18:14.674
It was me.

18:16.596 --> 18:19.463
I was taking a shortcut
home from school,

18:20.100 --> 18:25.220
and I saw the wreckage
of the train wreck,

18:25.313 --> 18:29.272
and ljust
had to help.

18:29.359 --> 18:31.475
Why didn't you
say something?

18:31.861 --> 18:33.601
I guess I didn't want
all the attention, you know?

18:35.240 --> 18:36.605
It's not Why I did it.

18:36.700 --> 18:40.318
Well, on behalf
of the Odessa
Fire Department,

pulled out of the train.

18:54.259 --> 18:57.877
Well, he's got
some pretty bad burns,
smoke damage to his lungs,

18:57.971 --> 19:01.714
but he's alive,
happy to be so.

got you alone.

asked Jackie

19:21.161 --> 19:23.493

of the Pioneer Day Parade?

19:23.580 --> 19:25.320
They're going to put her
on top of the fire truck.

19:25.415 --> 19:26.450
They should put her
under the fire truck.

19:26.541 --> 19:29.123
Look, it's about
the video tape.
What?

19:29.252 --> 19:31.789
The video tape! The tape
where you're like
killing yourself 20 times!

19:31.880 --> 19:33.666
Oh, yeah, that.
Can we just keep
that under wraps?

19:33.757 --> 19:36.590
That's what I'm trying
to tell you. It was in
my backpack and now it's not.

19:36.676 --> 19:37.665

about your father's death.

23:59.522 --> 24:01.353
He committed suicide.

24:02.233 --> 24:04.724
What?
He committed suicide.

24:05.486 --> 24:07.226
I found him on the
floor of the bathroom.

24:07.363 --> 24:09.649
You said he had
a heart attack.
I lied.

24:10.742 --> 24:12.903
For his reputation.
His heart was fine.

24:13.036 --> 24:16.995
But he had had
two others before that.
Well, I lied about those, too.

24:17.206 --> 24:19.242

Both of them.

24:19.542 --> 24:21.453
He finally got
what he wanted.

24:26.758 --> 24:30.967
When he was 23
he was diagnosed with
major depressive disorder.

He couldn't help it.
It was just who he was.

Why didn't I know about
any of this before?

24:36.476 --> 24:38.182
Your father and I decided
not to tell you

24:38.269 --> 24:41.102
since the disorder
can have a genetic link,

24:41.189 --> 24:42.895
and you were always
so sensitive.

We didn't want you
to worry about it.

24:52.450 --> 24:55.442
Thinking
you're invincible
or indestructible.

that then turn suicidal.

to lift her up that high.

No sign.

33:20.082 --> 33:21.583
A little angry?
Yeah.

33:21.667 --> 33:23.203
Angry enough to do
something about it?

33:23.586 --> 33:25.292
Maybe set yourself up
to look like a hero?

33:25.379 --> 33:27.370
Wait, you think I killed
these people?

33:27.464 --> 33:29.750
I didn't kill
these people.
Sylar did.

that name?

How did you know
that name?

assigned to this case
know the name Sylar.

33:39.518 --> 33:41.429

did you know that?

33:43.022 --> 33:44.137
I heard it.

33:46.442 --> 33:47.431
From you.

33:48.277 --> 33:49.938

the girl whisper.

33:51.363 --> 33:52.352

Hi, Dad.

35:38.220 --> 35:40.085
Hey. How was school?

35:40.723 --> 35:43.715
Very school-like.
How was work?
Very work-like.

35:44.059 --> 35:45.390
Listen, I...

35:45.769 --> 35:47.930
I made a couple
of calls today.

35:52.234 --> 35:55.271
Ispoke
to a very nice woman
at the adoption agency,

35:55.404 --> 35:59.113
and she said they
were going to try
to get in touch

35:59.908 --> 36:01.899
with your birth parents

36:02.745 --> 36:03.951
and request a meeting.

36:04.913 --> 36:06.449
I thought that was
an adult decision.

36:06.540 --> 36:10.909
Well, you seemed pretty adult
this morning when you told me
you wanted to do it.

36:11.211 --> 36:12.200
Thanks.

36:13.339 --> 36:19.426
She said it was a lengthy
process, and it could
take weeks. I'm hoping years.

36:19.595 --> 36:23.087
That way
you'll be my little girl
for a while longer.

36:24.767 --> 36:27.008
I'm not done
protecting you
from the world.

36:28.687 --> 36:29.927
You're my dad.

36:31.732 --> 36:34.098

not be my dad.

I promise I'll be
your little girl
for as long as I can.

36:41.283 --> 36:43.615
But you can't
protect me forever.

36:45.162 --> 36:46.698
I know.

36:48.791 --> 36:50.452
And it breaks my heart.

36:52.461 --> 36:53.792
I love you, Dad.

36:54.838 --> 36:56.624
I love you, too,

all over for you.

37:44.263 --> 37:46.754
Did you know
about Dad's depression?

37:48.308 --> 37:49.297
Yeah.

37:52.729 --> 37:54.515
Why didn't you
ever tell me?

37:55.190 --> 37:57.272
Because everyone is entitled
to their secrets, Peter.

38:04.783 --> 38:06.319
I was so sure
when it happened.

38:06.410 --> 38:08.571

I'm just going crazy.

you flew.

You.
