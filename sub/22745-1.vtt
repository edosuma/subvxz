05:10.278 --> 05:12.781
Great, come on.
No, don't wanna do that, bro.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.425
One, at least, please.

05:14.615 --> 05:17.459
Quiet, please.
We're about to film.

05:17.652 --> 05:20.258
Okay, boss, okay.
Quiet. Shut up.

05:20.454 --> 05:22.024
Ready?
Always.

05:25.092 --> 05:27.003
Ready?
Always.

05:27.195 --> 05:30.699
Rolling and action.

05:30.932 --> 05:32.843
Hi, guys.
Milow the girl here.

05:33.034 --> 05:35.310
As most of you know,
I'm here in the states

05:35.503 --> 05:37.107
on my "Days of Power" tour,

05:37.305 --> 05:38.978
and I'm looking forward
to getting to know

05:39.173 --> 05:40.846
my fans more personally,

05:41.042 --> 05:44.387
although my decision wasn't met by
the most glowing reviews by everyone

05:44.612 --> 05:45.955
like the band!

05:48.282 --> 05:49.352
Shut up!

05:49.550 --> 05:51.860
After experiencing how it's like

05:52.053 --> 05:53.396
to perform in arenas

05:53.621 --> 05:56.898
and traveling
on enormous tour buses

05:57.124 --> 06:00.697
I... I'm excited to have
scaled back the tour

06:00.895 --> 06:02.175
to how it was
from the beginning,

06:02.363 --> 06:07.745
and I know that, for me,
this is the right decision.

06:07.969 --> 06:10.313
Wrong.

06:10.504 --> 06:12.814
Well, then, what do
you think, Brooklyn?

06:15.343 --> 06:16.620
You're seriously asking me that?

06:16.644 --> 06:18.248
Yes, tell the camera
what you think.

06:20.982 --> 06:23.519
I think it's dangerous.

06:23.718 --> 06:24.526
People are crazy.

06:24.719 --> 06:25.925
Oh, come on.

06:26.153 --> 06:28.599
You're taking away definitive
itineraries, security.

06:28.823 --> 06:33.397
What's wrong with a little
spontaneity and freedom?

06:33.594 --> 06:35.954
I guess we'll figure
that answer out soon enough.

06:36.864 --> 06:39.344
I'm gonna miss
that epic tour bus.

06:39.533 --> 06:41.342
That transition's
gonna be tough.

06:41.535 --> 06:43.572
Well, I know I'm definitely
over the big stages,

06:43.771 --> 06:46.081
that's for sure.
Oh, yes, we all know

06:46.274 --> 06:47.844
how much you hate
those large mirrors

06:48.042 --> 06:50.352
on the bus and back stage areas.
Exactly.

06:50.544 --> 06:51.921
Just keepin' it real.

06:52.113 --> 06:53.557
Just keepin' it real.

06:53.581 --> 06:56.357
This is gonna be interesting.

06:56.550 --> 06:58.393
Still, it's insane.

06:58.586 --> 07:01.294
Well, there you have it,
the tour of madness

07:01.522 --> 07:03.195
is heading to a town near you.

07:03.391 --> 07:06.270
Brooklyn.

07:11.866 --> 07:13.368
Okay.

07:15.536 --> 07:17.038
He's just freaking out again.

07:17.238 --> 07:19.411
He'll be fine.

07:19.607 --> 07:20.915
You haven't said anything, Greg.

07:21.108 --> 07:22.382
I think we'll be fine.

07:22.576 --> 07:24.886
Look, besides, we're gonna
be face to face

07:25.079 --> 07:26.079
with your fans, right?

07:29.150 --> 07:30.950
How could that possibly
be the wrong decision?

07:31.085 --> 07:32.826
Exactly.

07:33.054 --> 07:33.725
Thank you.

07:43.597 --> 07:45.736
Hey, Lester!
Hey!

07:45.933 --> 07:48.277
Thank you, Gia.

07:48.469 --> 07:52.645
How's he been today?
Oh, god, seems stressed.

07:56.344 --> 07:59.018
Oh, my god, Milow,
I love what you do.

07:59.246 --> 08:00.691
You're great.
I'm really a fan.

08:00.915 --> 08:02.451
I'm a fan.
Thank you so much.

08:02.650 --> 08:05.130
Bye.
Bye.

08:05.319 --> 08:07.128
So how did Lester do today?

08:07.321 --> 08:09.028
He was very pitiful
when I took him away,

08:09.256 --> 08:11.668
but then he bosses around
a couple of dogs

08:11.859 --> 08:13.167
and he was great.

08:13.361 --> 08:14.704
And he was great.

08:14.929 --> 08:17.432
Baby.
Aww, come On, so to mama.

08:17.631 --> 08:19.372
Mamacito.

08:28.709 --> 08:29.949
Ready?

08:39.153 --> 08:40.996
So, are you having fun tonight?

08:45.860 --> 08:47.180
Dude, what are you
doing out here?

08:47.294 --> 08:49.467
Ma, too.

08:52.400 --> 08:53.811
Well, hello there.

08:57.204 --> 08:59.184
It appears we have a special
guest this evening.

09:05.346 --> 09:08.589
Give a shout out to
our little friend, Lester!

09:11.052 --> 09:13.054
Isn't he cute?

09:18.092 --> 09:20.936
Well, I guess you can see
who the star in the family is.

11:16.844 --> 11:18.721
Please let me out.

11:18.946 --> 11:21.483
Let me out.

11:21.682 --> 11:23.218
What's your name?

11:23.450 --> 11:25.521
Hannah.
Can you please help me?

11:28.455 --> 11:30.196
Can you please just let us out?

11:40.000 --> 11:42.742
No! No! No!
Please, don't go!

11:42.970 --> 11:44.040
Come back!

11:46.373 --> 11:47.977
Help!

12:14.935 --> 12:18.405
Come on, asshole, this should
have been done already.

12:18.606 --> 12:20.882
She's already pissed at us.
Now we're gonna be late, too.

12:21.075 --> 12:22.075
Good job.

12:22.209 --> 12:25.281
I told you I was busy.

12:25.512 --> 12:27.048
Anyway, half of them are dead.

12:27.248 --> 12:28.591
Exactly.

12:30.384 --> 12:32.762
We're late. We don't have
the number of mutts he wants,

12:32.953 --> 12:35.866
and we owe him money.
And we owe him money.

12:36.056 --> 12:38.593
I'll get 'em there in time.

12:43.464 --> 12:45.774
Asshole.

14:04.878 --> 14:07.791
Really unprecedented
scene at battery park

14:07.981 --> 14:11.053
under 12, 13 feet now of water,

14:11.285 --> 14:12.559
a surge.

14:12.786 --> 14:14.264
Short amount of time.

14:14.288 --> 14:16.099
Advised to stay off the roads,
if at all possible.

14:16.123 --> 14:17.568
The storm appears
to be moving north

14:17.791 --> 14:19.862
at approximately
25 miles per hour

14:20.060 --> 14:21.300
with high streamline winds,

14:21.495 --> 14:23.495
small to medium-sized hail
and dangerous lightning.

14:33.741 --> 14:35.687
Hello.

14:35.876 --> 14:37.156
You're gonna have
to turn around.

14:37.344 --> 14:39.522
We're heading to Lincoln.
Not this way you're aren't.

14:39.546 --> 14:41.066
But 34's the straightest
route we have.

14:41.181 --> 14:42.990
Hey, stop filming me.

14:43.183 --> 14:45.720
If you go down here, you're gonna
hit about four feet of water.

14:45.919 --> 14:47.921
This Van will not
take you through it.

14:48.155 --> 14:49.532
What other routes are there?

14:49.723 --> 14:51.862
You turn around,
you go down here to 63,

14:52.059 --> 14:53.379
you go north,
and then you hit 83.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.839
That'll take another half hour.
I didn't make it rain.

14:55.863 --> 14:57.672
Turn this thing around.

15:09.410 --> 15:10.889
That went well.

15:11.078 --> 15:12.284
We should just head back.

15:12.513 --> 15:14.959
I mean, we're not gonna
make it in time anyway, right?

15:20.521 --> 15:22.125
Oh, my god.
They're doing it again.

15:22.356 --> 15:25.235
Probably discussing chocolate.

15:37.771 --> 15:39.614
Sean, what are the chances of us

15:39.807 --> 15:41.007
getting stuck in this weather?

15:41.141 --> 15:42.814
Zero.

15:43.043 --> 15:44.750
I already turned around.

15:44.945 --> 15:46.288
See, all fine.

16:56.149 --> 16:57.787
Wake up! Wake up!

16:57.985 --> 16:59.157
Wake up! Wake up!

16:59.353 --> 17:00.627
Wake up!

17:10.531 --> 17:12.169
Hello?

17:12.366 --> 17:13.366
Yes, hello.

17:13.500 --> 17:14.569
Who's there?

17:14.800 --> 17:16.803
This is Gia!
Trinity?

17:17.003 --> 17:18.847
Yes, I'm here, I'm here.

17:19.039 --> 17:20.848
Where are you?

17:21.040 --> 17:22.040
I don't know.

17:22.142 --> 17:24.213
Can you... can you come help me?

17:24.411 --> 17:25.821
No, I... I...

17:28.048 --> 17:30.551
I am locked inside something.

17:30.751 --> 17:32.424
Are Riley and Milow with you?

17:32.653 --> 17:36.100
No, I don't know where they are.

17:36.323 --> 17:38.166
What can you see?

17:45.899 --> 17:47.276
Hold on.

17:55.208 --> 17:57.848
Just tell me what you're seeing.

18:10.023 --> 18:12.560
Dogs.

18:12.759 --> 18:14.966
They are all around me.

18:21.301 --> 18:22.445
What? What happened?
Are you okay?

18:22.469 --> 18:25.541
They're above me!
I can feel their feet.

18:34.314 --> 18:36.294
Leave me the fuck alone!

18:37.618 --> 18:40.224
Trinity, listen to me,
it's only dogs.

18:40.420 --> 18:41.228
It's only dogs.

19:27.100 --> 19:28.374
Hey.
Hey.

19:28.602 --> 19:29.722
Are you good?
I got this.

19:29.836 --> 19:32.180
Okay.
I'll meet you over there.

19:32.372 --> 19:34.875
We're actually gonna see
a real movie in a theater.

19:35.108 --> 19:36.108
You're a back up singer!

19:36.209 --> 19:37.369
I need an autograph from you.

19:37.477 --> 19:40.822
Hey.
Don't touch her.

19:41.014 --> 19:42.174
Trust me, it'll be a problem.

19:42.315 --> 19:42.850
All right, all right.

19:43.050 --> 19:44.996
Brooklyn.
I'm sorry.

19:45.185 --> 19:47.495
Chill, man.
He just wants an autograph.

19:47.688 --> 19:49.497
Hey.

19:49.690 --> 19:51.727
You know I, um,

19:51.958 --> 19:55.405
I haven't signed
one of these in a long time.

19:55.629 --> 19:56.869
What did I miss?

19:58.832 --> 20:01.574
He just wants an autograph.
It's okay.

20:01.802 --> 20:03.562
Relax.
Okay, so that's one point for you.

20:03.704 --> 20:05.815
Wait, what are we seeing?
I'll get a few more before we're out here.

20:05.839 --> 20:07.341
Dude.
Calm down, brother.

20:09.543 --> 20:10.578
Thank you.

20:10.811 --> 20:12.222
Zoey!
Take care.

20:16.817 --> 20:17.817
My hero.

20:19.519 --> 20:21.226
It's Milow.

20:25.826 --> 20:27.499
Hello?

20:27.694 --> 20:29.105
How are you?

20:29.329 --> 20:30.774
I just can't stop thinking

20:30.997 --> 20:32.757
about that ridiculous
sound check last night.

20:32.899 --> 20:34.401
It was crazy.
Oh, my god.

20:34.601 --> 20:36.179
He had no idea
what he was doing.

20:36.203 --> 20:38.706
I can't believe we even
made it through the sound check.

20:38.905 --> 20:40.583
I mean, what did he say?
I mean, "hit the mic

20:40.607 --> 20:42.085
as hard as you can"?
As hard as you can.

20:42.109 --> 20:43.747
Oh, yeah.
What? Like, what?

20:43.944 --> 20:46.447
The guy thought that was faster.

20:46.680 --> 20:48.887
I love you, too.
Ciao.

20:50.584 --> 20:52.791
That guy in the lobby
was an asshole.

20:53.019 --> 20:56.057
Brooklyn, relax.
He's gone.

20:56.256 --> 20:57.792
But that sound guy
was almost as slow

20:58.024 --> 20:59.268
as our good friend Riley here.

20:59.292 --> 21:00.965
Here we go.

21:01.194 --> 21:03.765
Oh, no, not possible.
Not possible.

21:03.964 --> 21:07.639
Plus that goofy hair and girly makeup
you wear takes too much effort.

21:07.868 --> 21:09.612
That's it, I'm out.
The man has a point.

21:09.636 --> 21:11.081
No, please stay.

21:11.271 --> 21:13.410
Where you going?
I'm out.

21:13.607 --> 21:15.553
Well, hurry, or you'll
miss the previews.

21:15.742 --> 21:17.278
Be courteous to others.

21:17.477 --> 21:20.117
Turn off all cell phones.
I'll have to find a mirror, no doubt,

21:20.280 --> 21:22.226
Devices while watching the film.

21:22.415 --> 21:24.292
What happened earlier?

21:24.484 --> 21:27.055
It was just a guy
who wanted my autograph,

21:27.254 --> 21:28.824
and Brooklyn freaked out on him.

21:29.055 --> 21:31.262
But it was fine.
Of course.

21:31.458 --> 21:32.960
No one puts Zoey in the corner.

21:35.595 --> 21:37.074
You spilled your popcorn
all over me.

21:37.264 --> 21:38.641
I got hot buttered nipples.

21:38.832 --> 21:40.072
You're welcome.

21:40.267 --> 21:42.144
They're gonna miss the movie.

21:42.335 --> 21:44.645

23:50.196 --> 23:51.732
No signal.
That's it.

23:51.932 --> 23:54.043
I'm switching services
as soon as we get back to L.A.

23:54.067 --> 23:55.603
Yeah, me, too.

23:57.037 --> 23:58.573
Well.

24:03.610 --> 24:05.647
How did I get roped
into videoing this shit?

24:05.879 --> 24:08.587
Relax. The guy needed
a personal day.

24:08.782 --> 24:10.659
Let it go.
Why are you so bitchy?

24:10.884 --> 24:12.056
I'm not bitchy.

24:12.252 --> 24:14.323
How come every time
I decide to criticize you,

24:14.554 --> 24:16.659
I'm suddenly being bitchy?

24:16.890 --> 24:18.927
Okay, miss not bitchy,
let's take a poll

24:19.125 --> 24:20.365
when this documentary comes out

24:20.560 --> 24:22.271
and see how many times
when I say you're being bitchy,

24:22.295 --> 24:23.603
the fans think you are, too.

24:23.797 --> 24:25.117
Like you're even
going to be in it

24:25.231 --> 24:26.351
when they finish editing it.

24:26.499 --> 24:28.570
Right, like you're the only
star around here?

24:28.768 --> 24:30.679
You're so ridiculous.

24:30.904 --> 24:32.008
You love it.

24:53.593 --> 24:56.164
Oh, oh, hi.
Hello?

24:56.363 --> 24:58.138
We talked earlier today,

24:58.331 --> 25:00.470
we're the ones looking
for the chihuahua.

25:00.667 --> 25:03.170
Oh, yeah, yeah, come on in,

25:03.370 --> 25:05.941
except you can't
bring that in here.

25:06.139 --> 25:07.447
You didn't get this cleared?

25:07.640 --> 25:12.180
Yeah, uh, so we are shooting
this documentary thing,

25:12.379 --> 25:14.723
and we were just trying to get
some footage of the dogs.

25:14.948 --> 25:17.224
Hi there.

25:17.450 --> 25:19.327
I'm sorry, you can't
bring that in here.

25:19.519 --> 25:22.398
It's just that this is our home

25:22.622 --> 25:25.159
and you know how crazy people
can be these days.

25:29.295 --> 25:30.968
It's okay.
We understand.

25:51.818 --> 25:53.695
Hello.
Hello.

25:57.991 --> 25:59.035
So these are all rescues?

25:59.059 --> 26:01.437
No, just the shy one there.

26:01.661 --> 26:03.663
The others are the babies
of peanut and Chloe.

26:03.863 --> 26:06.036
That's the Mom and Dad
right there.

26:06.232 --> 26:07.404
They're all so cute,

26:07.600 --> 26:09.170
but I only want to adopt.

26:09.369 --> 26:14.341
Is she fixed? Yes, she's not
able to breed at all anymore.

26:18.278 --> 26:20.724
Is it okay if I bring out my
other dog to see how they mix?

26:20.914 --> 26:23.918
Of course. We want to
make sure they get along.

26:24.851 --> 26:26.888
There's a fee, yes?
Yes.

26:27.087 --> 26:30.091
We maintain what we like
to call an animal sanctuary.

26:30.290 --> 26:31.792
We like to foster
all sorts of dogs,

26:32.025 --> 26:35.029
and this helps us maintain
all we need for the animals.

26:36.629 --> 26:39.542
It's okay. It's okay.

26:39.732 --> 26:41.905
Good.
It's okay.

26:45.038 --> 26:47.075
Lester!

26:47.273 --> 26:49.753
I'm so sorry.
It's fine. It's fine.

26:49.943 --> 26:51.286
He must be scared.

26:51.478 --> 26:52.478
He never does this.

26:52.645 --> 26:55.592
Just go grab the cleaner
and the towel.

26:58.384 --> 26:59.829
I'm just gonna take him
out quickly.

27:00.053 --> 27:01.760
Just take him
right on out that way.

27:01.955 --> 27:03.491
No, no, no, you help them.

27:03.723 --> 27:04.723
I'll go.

27:04.824 --> 27:05.928
Smoker.

27:41.694 --> 27:43.696
Where the fuck is it?
I don't know.

27:43.930 --> 27:45.637
You said you put it here.

28:35.148 --> 28:37.355
Hello, my friend.

28:37.550 --> 28:39.325
Hey.

28:39.519 --> 28:41.829
Am <i>I</i> interrupting?
No.

28:42.021 --> 28:44.331
Good.
I just had some work I need to finish up.

28:44.524 --> 28:46.834
How we doing on our arrangement?

28:47.026 --> 28:48.733
Good.
Good?

28:48.928 --> 28:53.035
Food is good.
If we're doing well...

28:53.233 --> 28:54.405
You have something for me.

28:54.601 --> 28:56.444
We just need a few more days.

28:56.669 --> 28:59.946
The folks got delayed
in coming down to get the dogs.

29:00.173 --> 29:01.550
The payment
will be ready shortly.

29:01.574 --> 29:03.053
It better be.

29:09.849 --> 29:11.590
Lester!

29:14.220 --> 29:16.131
Lester!

29:16.356 --> 29:19.303
Lester, you've gone
far enough now.

29:35.541 --> 29:37.077
Lester.

29:40.647 --> 29:43.093
I am a patient man.
Wouldn't you say I'm patient?

29:45.051 --> 29:49.591
But I am a businessman, and you and
you are messing with my business,

29:49.789 --> 29:52.565
so you sell however
many Benjis you need to

29:52.759 --> 29:55.501
to get me money and quickly.

29:57.463 --> 30:00.444
You have my drugs.
Now I expect my money.

30:05.405 --> 30:06.850
Is that clear?

30:10.643 --> 30:13.522
'Cause I will not have
this conversation again.

30:15.982 --> 30:17.461
Get back to work.

30:23.423 --> 30:26.267
Back the fuck off!

30:47.113 --> 30:48.649
What's that awful smell?

30:50.016 --> 30:51.461
Do you smell that?

30:51.651 --> 30:53.653
Yeah, I do.

31:06.132 --> 31:07.668
Hold still.

31:11.671 --> 31:13.173
Lay down.

31:18.511 --> 31:20.013
Come on, Lester.

31:39.732 --> 31:41.009
What the fuck
are you doing here?

31:41.033 --> 31:42.603
James, get her!

31:43.836 --> 31:45.509
Milow!

31:49.409 --> 31:51.355
Come Over here!
Stop! Stop it.

31:51.544 --> 31:53.524
You're not meant
to be in this place!

31:58.217 --> 31:59.328
Shut the fuck up!
Stop it!

31:59.352 --> 32:00.956
No!

32:02.054 --> 32:03.065
Stop!

32:08.928 --> 32:11.704
Shut the fuck up!

32:11.898 --> 32:14.037
I've got a present for you.

32:14.233 --> 32:15.735
This little baby.
No!

32:15.935 --> 32:18.211
No!

32:18.404 --> 32:19.915
I'm Santa Claus.

32:19.939 --> 32:21.384
Nothing can fuck me.

32:21.574 --> 32:22.574
No!

32:22.742 --> 32:23.743
<i>Stop it!</i>

32:25.077 --> 32:27.284
Stop!
No!

32:27.480 --> 32:28.823
No!

32:29.048 --> 32:31.756
Help me!
Somebody help!

33:38.117 --> 33:40.996
Thank you from me and the band.

34:37.076 --> 34:41.047
Hello? Hello?
Can anyone hear me?

34:42.380 --> 34:44.121
Hello?

34:44.350 --> 34:45.693
Yes, hello, can you hear me?

34:45.885 --> 34:46.995
Trinity?
Yes, it's me, Riley. Where are you?

34:47.018 --> 34:47.759
I'm over here.
Let me out.

34:47.954 --> 34:49.627
I'm in a cage.

34:54.260 --> 34:55.431
Are you okay?

35:00.199 --> 35:01.872
What happened?

35:02.068 --> 35:04.275
I don't know.

35:04.470 --> 35:05.278
Where are we?

35:05.471 --> 35:07.576
Riley, I don't know.

35:07.773 --> 35:09.582
You had to see something!

35:09.775 --> 35:11.311
What do you remember?

35:19.452 --> 35:20.829
What happened?
Are you okay?

35:21.053 --> 35:22.930
This place is...
I know.

35:24.557 --> 35:26.127
How are we gonna get outta here?

35:26.325 --> 35:26.928
We will.

35:27.126 --> 35:28.400
We'll get out.

35:30.763 --> 35:31.833
Fuck!

35:33.599 --> 35:35.340
Riley, answer me, are you okay?

35:35.568 --> 35:37.241
My leg.
It's cut.

35:37.436 --> 35:38.574
How bad?

35:38.771 --> 35:41.149
Pretty bad.

35:41.340 --> 35:42.683
Where's Gia?
I don't know.

35:42.908 --> 35:43.948
I don't know.
She was here.

35:44.076 --> 35:45.220
I haven't heard
anything from her.

35:45.244 --> 35:46.450
Where's Milow?

35:46.646 --> 35:49.422
I don't know!
Riley, you were with her last.

35:49.615 --> 35:51.492
They were killing them.
Killing who?

35:51.684 --> 35:53.129
We weren't supposed to see it.

35:53.319 --> 35:54.627
Who were they killing, Riley?

35:54.820 --> 35:56.595
Answer me.
Not Milow.

36:14.273 --> 36:16.378
Hey, guys,
it's Milow the girl here.

36:16.609 --> 36:19.146
We just finished our show
and we're going to...

36:19.345 --> 36:20.722
Where are we going?

36:20.946 --> 36:22.448
Missouri.
Missouri.

36:22.648 --> 36:26.687
And I decided I'm gonna get a
brother or a sister for Lester.

36:26.886 --> 36:29.332
And we... what do you
call that again?

36:29.522 --> 36:31.160
Lineage, bloodline.

36:33.726 --> 36:35.171
You tell them.

36:35.361 --> 36:37.398
No, no, no, no.

36:37.630 --> 36:40.839
Well, basically,
we traced down ms parents,

36:41.033 --> 36:43.707
and we found them
in Missouri at this place,

36:43.903 --> 36:46.315
hope estates,
that we're going to,

36:46.505 --> 36:48.348
and we're gonna
get him a friend there.

36:48.541 --> 36:51.852
Yeah, not all of us.

36:52.044 --> 36:54.251
What?
What are your plans, Brooklyn?

36:54.480 --> 36:56.585
You don't wanna check out
the small town night life?

36:56.816 --> 36:59.524
Maybe.
What are you gonna do?

36:59.719 --> 37:01.323
I'm chilling at the hotel.

37:01.520 --> 37:04.729
I'll go with Milow.
Thank you, Riley.

37:07.059 --> 37:09.039
I can't. I can't.
I know I'll fall in love

37:09.228 --> 37:11.265
with the puppy
and have to take it home.

37:11.497 --> 37:13.568
I'm just gonna stay
at the hotel with Greg.

37:13.766 --> 37:15.746
Lame.

38:30.509 --> 38:32.011
What the hell are you doing?

38:32.244 --> 38:35.282
We got serious problems and
you're in here screwing around!

38:35.481 --> 38:36.926
It's my day off, right?

38:37.116 --> 38:39.460
I've got six dead puppies
that were fried by the wire.

38:39.652 --> 38:41.963
They're dropping like flies, and
you're in here fucking around

38:41.987 --> 38:43.107
with drugs you can't afford.

38:43.255 --> 38:45.462
What's that dog doing in here?

38:45.658 --> 38:46.658
Get him to work now!

38:46.759 --> 38:48.432
Between the drugs
and those people,

38:48.627 --> 38:50.334
you don't get a day off.

38:52.765 --> 38:54.540
Enough!
You need to buck up, soldier,

38:54.767 --> 38:56.407
and wipe that fuckin' snow
from your nose.

38:56.535 --> 38:59.482
We got a job to do,
and you know the fuckin' rules.

38:59.672 --> 39:02.448
Now pull your shit together
and get those dogs to work.

39:02.641 --> 39:05.349
I need those puppies,
and I need them now.

39:10.216 --> 39:12.628
I got your fuckin' puppies.

39:19.792 --> 39:21.032
Fuckin' asshole.

39:33.572 --> 39:35.017
I got ya.

39:48.687 --> 39:50.166

Hey, do I know you?

44:19.958 --> 44:22.302
Give me the bag.

44:22.494 --> 44:24.269
No.

44:26.098 --> 44:30.478
Open your purse.

44:30.669 --> 44:32.205
What are you talking about?

44:34.540 --> 44:37.043
Look up.

44:37.276 --> 44:40.189
See? I was reviewing
some footage.

44:40.379 --> 44:43.792
Saw you got a little
company in there.

44:43.982 --> 44:46.053
Now hand over the bag.

44:47.986 --> 44:50.398
Give me the bag.

44:50.622 --> 44:51.828
No.

44:53.892 --> 44:56.805
Take him out of the bag.

44:56.995 --> 44:59.475
Take him out of the bag!

44:59.665 --> 45:02.578
I know how to work a zipper.

45:05.037 --> 45:06.710
I'd die first.

45:08.707 --> 45:10.243
Careful.

45:15.380 --> 45:20.193
I'm gonna say this
one last time.

45:27.159 --> 45:29.833
Give me the bag.

45:30.028 --> 45:32.907
Give me the bag!

45:41.173 --> 45:42.584
Drop it,

45:42.774 --> 45:47.018
or I swear
you'll sincerely regret it.

46:03.095 --> 46:06.474
Thought so.

46:25.217 --> 46:26.662
Get the fuck off me!

46:27.319 --> 46:28.627
Get off!

46:33.492 --> 46:36.939
Sleep tight.

46:39.097 --> 46:40.269
Come here.

46:40.465 --> 46:43.844
Let's see what cage
we got for you, little guy.

47:02.254 --> 47:04.359
No! No, please!
Give him back!

47:04.589 --> 47:06.000
Please, give him back!

47:06.191 --> 47:08.171
Give him back to me.

47:08.360 --> 47:09.805
Please, just give him...

48:32.677 --> 48:34.918
Gia? Gia?

48:35.113 --> 48:36.524
Trinity?
Yes, I'm over here.

48:36.715 --> 48:38.524
I'm over here.
So is Riley.

48:38.717 --> 48:40.924
I talked with him.
I must've passed out.

48:41.119 --> 48:43.099
We need to get out of here now.

48:43.288 --> 48:44.699
Yeah, come on!

48:47.893 --> 48:51.431
I think I might have a clip.

48:51.630 --> 48:53.371
I'm looking!

48:57.402 --> 49:00.383
I have nothing! This is
completely fucking useless!

49:00.572 --> 49:03.143
I have a clip.
I'm trying to pick the lock.

49:05.310 --> 49:06.414
<i>Gia.</i>

49:09.114 --> 49:11.424
Come on!
You can do this.

49:11.616 --> 49:12.794
I've seen you do it
a million times.

49:12.818 --> 49:13.818
You've got this.

49:13.919 --> 49:15.660
Hurry!

49:15.887 --> 49:20.165
Come on, Gia!
Gia, Gia, come on!

49:21.793 --> 49:24.000
Come on, Gia!
You got this, Gia.

49:24.229 --> 49:25.469
Just go, Gia.

49:25.664 --> 49:26.404
<i>Gia.</i>

49:26.598 --> 49:29.306
Get the camera.

49:29.501 --> 49:30.980
I have it! I have it!

49:33.071 --> 49:34.812
Go!

49:37.843 --> 49:39.948
Yes, thank you!
Come on, come on.

49:40.145 --> 49:41.785
Gia, I'm over here!
Come on!

49:41.980 --> 49:44.984
Come and let me out!
Gia!

49:45.183 --> 49:46.958
You're good.
Go get her!

49:47.152 --> 49:48.631
Get me the fuck outta here!

49:49.588 --> 49:50.588
No!

49:52.657 --> 49:53.657
Aah!

50:03.301 --> 50:05.338
Get her and
get the fuck outta here!

50:07.339 --> 50:08.340
Come on!

50:09.474 --> 50:10.754
Just get her and get outta here!

50:10.876 --> 50:13.322
I'm not leaving without you.
You girls, go!

50:17.983 --> 50:19.656
You've got to go!

50:19.851 --> 50:22.388
Trinity!
No, no, no, no, no!

50:23.788 --> 50:25.290
Damn it, Trinity.
Let's go.

50:25.490 --> 50:28.630
Go! Go! Go!
I can't leave you!

50:28.827 --> 50:31.034
Trinity.
Go!

50:31.229 --> 50:33.300
Go!
Come on!

51:10.569 --> 51:12.674
Nice try, motherfucker.

51:28.887 --> 51:30.798
Gotcha.

51:31.690 --> 51:33.294
Where is that fucking thing?

51:41.900 --> 51:44.312
You think that hurt?

51:57.415 --> 51:58.758
Riley?

52:01.553 --> 52:03.658
Why can't I hear you anymore?

52:03.888 --> 52:05.561
Please answer me!

52:09.427 --> 52:10.929
Riley!

52:20.972 --> 52:22.178
Riley!

52:32.250 --> 52:34.093
Riley!

52:40.492 --> 52:43.098
I've got a special
place for you.

52:48.633 --> 52:50.169
Riley!

52:53.204 --> 52:55.480
Riley!

53:05.884 --> 53:08.888
Trinity! Trinity! Trinity!

53:09.120 --> 53:11.293
Gia! Where are you?

53:12.791 --> 53:14.896
Gia?
It's filling up with water and fast!

53:15.126 --> 53:16.696
What? What do you mean?

53:18.797 --> 53:20.367
I think I'm in a fucking hole!

53:20.565 --> 53:22.044
Okay, what do you have with you?

53:22.233 --> 53:24.179
Can you climb out of it?

53:24.369 --> 53:27.043
I am all chained up.

53:27.238 --> 53:29.047
You have to stay calm.

53:31.242 --> 53:34.155
I need you to get
out of there, please.

53:34.345 --> 53:35.915
Oh, my god, I'm gonna drown!

53:36.147 --> 53:37.524
Gia, you have to calm down.

53:37.716 --> 53:38.922
I'm going to die.

53:39.150 --> 53:40.652
I'm gonna die!
I'm gonna drown!

53:40.852 --> 53:42.661
I'm gonna fucking drown!
Stop saying that.

53:50.662 --> 53:51.662
Look!

54:03.108 --> 54:05.110
Get the fuck out!

54:12.250 --> 54:13.558
Gia, you have to calm down.

54:22.560 --> 54:25.370
Get out! Get out!

54:45.450 --> 54:47.054
I'm sorry!

54:54.058 --> 54:55.731
I'm sorry.

55:03.234 --> 55:05.271
<i>♪ I'm never coming back ♪</i>

55:05.470 --> 55:07.347
<i>♪ when I go ♪</i>

55:07.572 --> 55:10.109
no, I'm sorry.

55:10.308 --> 55:13.778
That's all the information
I have at the moment.

55:13.978 --> 55:17.289
Well, we hope that she will
be back in time for that.

55:17.482 --> 55:21.521
Well, look... yes, <i>I</i> understand.

55:21.753 --> 55:23.926
We'll be in touch.

55:24.122 --> 55:25.260
Meghan!

55:26.191 --> 55:27.465
Meghan!

55:33.932 --> 55:37.880
If you put another
agent or venue

55:38.102 --> 55:39.342
through to my phone line today,

55:39.504 --> 55:41.006
you're fired!

55:41.206 --> 55:43.015
I don't have time to deal
with that right now.

55:43.208 --> 55:44.208
I'm sorry.

55:44.309 --> 55:45.947
Ed, do you want me
to get the camera?

55:46.144 --> 55:47.488
Do you want me to start
to shoot this?

55:47.512 --> 55:49.492
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
start to shoot this.

56:01.326 --> 56:03.533
All right, so here's the deal.

56:03.728 --> 56:05.833
We are going to be
answering no questions.

56:06.030 --> 56:08.237
We are going to keep
our mouths shut.

56:08.466 --> 56:11.242
We can't jeopardize
the chance of finding them.

56:11.469 --> 56:13.380
Have it put up on her website.

56:13.571 --> 56:15.016
Today...

56:15.206 --> 56:17.015
That she's on hiatus.

56:17.208 --> 56:18.915
This is not national
headline news,

56:19.143 --> 56:22.317
and we want to keep it that way,
as long as we can...

56:22.513 --> 56:24.515
Which won't be for long.

56:24.716 --> 56:26.855
I need a schedule.
Any information that you have

56:27.051 --> 56:28.051
on where they were going,

56:28.186 --> 56:30.325
hotels, anything
you can think of.

56:30.521 --> 56:32.398
They uploaded a video
from the last show.

56:32.590 --> 56:35.434
I don't think the departments
seen them yet.

56:35.660 --> 56:36.780
Well, find out if they have.

56:36.895 --> 56:38.499
Go.

56:39.530 --> 56:40.907
Go!

56:42.433 --> 56:43.935
Now!

56:46.204 --> 56:47.774
That's your cousin.

57:16.034 --> 57:17.775
Time to wake up.

57:20.238 --> 57:22.445
Are you hungry? Huh?

57:24.275 --> 57:25.948
You need these.

57:26.144 --> 57:29.125
Better eat up good,
cause you're gonna need it.

57:33.551 --> 57:35.053
Here you go.

57:42.327 --> 57:44.273
Travis, what the fuck Is this?

57:44.462 --> 57:45.839
What the fuck is what?

57:46.064 --> 57:47.907
How in the hell did this happen?

57:58.776 --> 58:01.586
Smells like death.

58:01.779 --> 58:04.851
He's not gonna make it.

58:13.358 --> 58:15.531
All right, let's get
this over with.

58:26.204 --> 58:27.706
Where are you taking him?

58:27.939 --> 58:30.476
Stop it! You're only
making him worse!

58:33.277 --> 58:34.984
You'll feel better real soon.

58:35.179 --> 58:36.522
Best thing for him.

58:37.115 --> 58:38.685
No, stop!

58:38.883 --> 58:40.362
No, please!

58:43.154 --> 58:44.690
Please stop it!

58:44.889 --> 58:46.163
No!

58:46.357 --> 58:48.064
No!

58:59.637 --> 59:02.208
We got other plans for you.

59:37.675 --> 59:40.519
What are you doing?

59:40.711 --> 59:42.213
Nothing.

59:42.413 --> 59:44.916
Nothing what?
Nothing, Sir.

59:46.951 --> 59:48.897
Don't you lie to me,
you little brat.

59:51.255 --> 59:53.462
Have you been stealing treats?

59:55.526 --> 59:58.473
I asked you a question.

59:58.696 --> 01:00:00.733
You're gonna answer.

01:00:03.634 --> 01:00:06.137
Have you've been stealing
treats again?

01:00:06.370 --> 01:00:07.940
Yes, Sir.

01:00:13.578 --> 01:00:15.421
What's goin' on in here?

01:00:18.950 --> 01:00:21.089
She's been stealing
treats again.

01:00:24.655 --> 01:00:26.566
Is this true?

01:00:29.393 --> 01:00:33.239
Mama has told you
that you can't take treats,

01:00:33.431 --> 01:00:34.603
from the kitchen.

01:00:34.799 --> 01:00:37.780
Now papa's gonna
have to chastise you.

01:00:37.969 --> 01:00:40.506
Get the rod, Tom.

01:00:40.738 --> 01:00:42.183
With pleasure.

01:00:42.406 --> 01:00:45.615
Mama is gonna go downstairs
and finish making dinner,

01:00:45.810 --> 01:00:49.417
and she'll not hear a peep
out of this room.

01:00:49.614 --> 01:00:53.653
We can't have wailing while I'm
trying to prepare a decent meal,

01:00:53.851 --> 01:00:56.764
which you'll partake none.

01:01:00.191 --> 01:01:02.501
Make sure her lesson
leaves reminders.

01:01:14.272 --> 01:01:16.283
International
pop star, Milow the girl,

01:01:16.307 --> 01:01:17.786
her assistant,
and two bandmates,

01:01:17.975 --> 01:01:19.045
have gone missing.

01:01:19.277 --> 01:01:22.190
The group, last seen
in this local music venue,

01:01:22.380 --> 01:01:25.122
have baffled authorities
with their sudden disappearance.

01:01:25.316 --> 01:01:27.990
Earlier today the chief
of police had this to say.

01:01:28.186 --> 01:01:30.223
At this time, the disappearance

01:01:30.454 --> 01:01:34.834
of Milow the girl
is under investigation.

01:01:35.026 --> 01:01:39.059
Our department will do
everything it can to find her.

01:01:39.083 --> 01:01:40.500
What the hell?

01:01:40.665 --> 01:01:44.374
<i>I</i> have no further
information for you at this time.

01:01:44.569 --> 01:01:47.072
More to come
as the story develops.

01:01:47.305 --> 01:01:49.911
Turn it off.

01:01:50.141 --> 01:01:52.678
Thought she looked familiar.

01:01:52.877 --> 01:01:54.322
You knew?

01:01:54.512 --> 01:01:57.891
No, I just thought
she looked familiar.

01:01:59.650 --> 01:02:03.826
I didn't know.
I didn't know she was famous.

01:02:04.021 --> 01:02:05.864
Where are they?

01:02:08.593 --> 01:02:10.869
Where are they?

01:02:11.062 --> 01:02:12.939
One of them's dead.

01:02:16.267 --> 01:02:17.267
We had to.

01:02:17.435 --> 01:02:20.245
The famous one is fine.

01:02:24.542 --> 01:02:26.544
Is that fine?

01:02:28.913 --> 01:02:30.358
Is that fine?

01:02:30.548 --> 01:02:32.255
Oh, everything's just fine.

01:02:34.051 --> 01:02:38.022
I ain't got a fuckin'
care in the world.

01:02:38.222 --> 01:02:41.203
Police trace that bitch
back to our house,

01:02:41.392 --> 01:02:44.100
and you say everything's fine.

01:03:06.484 --> 01:03:11.092
The best part of you dripped
down your mama's leg-.

01:03:11.289 --> 01:03:12.427
If they shut us down,

01:03:12.623 --> 01:03:16.070
how are we gonna
pay off your debt?

01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:19.798
I knew you all were useless the
minute we started this charade.

01:03:21.098 --> 01:03:24.910
Now we stand to lose
$200 thousand worth

01:03:25.102 --> 01:03:26.843
of breeding stock,

01:03:27.071 --> 01:03:30.848
not to mention end up at the
mercy of your dealer friend.

01:03:31.075 --> 01:03:34.613
So, how are we gonna fix this?

01:03:34.812 --> 01:03:36.291
How?

01:03:41.285 --> 01:03:43.322
Last I heard,

01:03:43.521 --> 01:03:47.992
they hung good ol' Gary up
like one of their cattle.

01:03:48.192 --> 01:03:52.971
Sliced him from top to bottom.

01:03:53.164 --> 01:03:57.044
Drained his blood and watched
while it happened.

01:03:57.268 --> 01:04:00.875
Let me tell you something,

01:04:01.105 --> 01:04:03.346
that ain't gonna be me.

01:04:06.344 --> 01:04:09.723
We are gonna pay off that debt,

01:04:09.947 --> 01:04:12.985
and we're gonna use
these dogs to do it.

01:04:13.851 --> 01:04:15.159
Get off!

01:04:24.295 --> 01:04:26.172
Lester's gone.

01:04:27.565 --> 01:04:30.136
They took him from me.

01:04:30.334 --> 01:04:33.713
Doesn't look good for us two.

01:04:33.904 --> 01:04:40.344
But I guess you already
know that, huh?

01:04:40.544 --> 01:04:46.187
How could I of all people
not have known about this?

01:04:46.384 --> 01:04:48.694
I feel like such an idiot.

01:04:50.654 --> 01:04:53.498
This is all my fault.

01:04:53.691 --> 01:04:57.833
None of us would have been here
if it wasn't for me.

01:05:02.166 --> 01:05:03.736
Hey.

01:05:09.673 --> 01:05:12.950
Any ideas of how we can
get outta here?

01:05:14.512 --> 01:05:15.512
What is it?

01:05:15.613 --> 01:05:17.115
What are you looking at?

01:05:22.052 --> 01:05:23.690
Up here?

01:05:23.888 --> 01:05:26.266
What is it?

01:05:26.457 --> 01:05:27.800
I can't fit through here.

01:05:39.904 --> 01:05:41.611
You're pretty smart.

01:06:13.437 --> 01:06:14.677
So, is she okay?

01:06:14.905 --> 01:06:16.816
Yeah, she's...

01:06:17.007 --> 01:06:20.614
She just feels bad that she
didn't get there on time

01:06:20.811 --> 01:06:21.983
and now he's gone.

01:06:22.179 --> 01:06:23.790
I mean, there's nothing
she could have done.

01:06:23.814 --> 01:06:26.351
She could have
canceled the show.

01:06:26.584 --> 01:06:30.293
Hey, I mean, he knew
she was there in spirit.

01:06:30.488 --> 01:06:32.661
Protect your asses.

01:06:32.857 --> 01:06:33.857
Oh!
Shut the fuck...

01:06:34.024 --> 01:06:36.197
Where are we, number one?

01:06:36.427 --> 01:06:39.431
What?
Your nose is shaped like a dick.

01:06:39.630 --> 01:06:41.132
It's that damn Cologne
you're wearing

01:06:41.332 --> 01:06:42.843
that's attracting the bugs.
I don't know what we're doing.

01:06:42.867 --> 01:06:44.907
This Cologne attracts
anything I need it to attract.

01:06:45.102 --> 01:06:46.313
You're wearing fucking perfume.

01:06:46.337 --> 01:06:47.543
You got a cigarette?

01:06:47.771 --> 01:06:49.944
Come on, give me one.
Give me one!

01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:51.813
Riley, the rainbow room's
that way,

01:06:52.009 --> 01:06:53.153
where the fuck you taking us?

01:06:53.177 --> 01:06:56.158
No, they went this way.
I can barely...

01:06:56.347 --> 01:06:57.485
Huh?

01:06:57.681 --> 01:06:59.683
We gotta find... we gotta find
Zoey and Trinity.

01:07:01.051 --> 01:07:04.362
Come on, she was so...

01:07:04.555 --> 01:07:07.695
Excited to get back to
the grass roots of everything.

01:07:07.892 --> 01:07:10.065
I mean, she's not wrong.

01:07:10.294 --> 01:07:12.137
You know this lifestyle,
you know.

01:07:12.329 --> 01:07:17.745
You miss out on events and moments
in life and you never get them back.

01:07:17.968 --> 01:07:20.881
Well, now that we're scaling
the tour back and everything,

01:07:21.071 --> 01:07:22.649
we'll be able to have
those moments again.

01:07:22.673 --> 01:07:25.176
Live normal lives.

01:07:25.376 --> 01:07:29.222
Be normal people, right?

01:07:34.051 --> 01:07:35.496
You're gonna hate it!

01:07:37.821 --> 01:07:40.062
I seriously heard
some shit, much later.

01:07:40.257 --> 01:07:41.497
There were.
Him wrestling?

01:07:41.692 --> 01:07:43.763
No, no, many men?
Ah, there's no chance in hell.

01:07:43.994 --> 01:07:46.167
There's not...

01:07:46.363 --> 01:07:48.001
There's not a chance in hell
I'm going.

01:07:48.198 --> 01:07:50.178
Losers.
They totally love this.

01:07:50.367 --> 01:07:51.675
Why is he wearing sunglasses?

01:07:51.869 --> 01:07:54.543
It's not even bright outside.
I have no idea.

01:07:54.738 --> 01:07:56.547
He thinks he's like a cool cat.

01:07:56.740 --> 01:07:58.014
Oh, look who's here.

01:07:58.208 --> 01:08:00.449
We've been looking for you two.

01:08:00.678 --> 01:08:01.850
We have sound check.

01:08:02.046 --> 01:08:04.253
Ah, no, no sound check today.

01:08:04.448 --> 01:08:06.394
No sound check, why?

01:08:06.584 --> 01:08:09.963
Because I said so,
you whiny bitches.

01:08:11.388 --> 01:08:14.460
Oh, I can't.
No!

01:08:18.028 --> 01:08:20.148
I literally hate you.
Okay, that was pretty close.

01:08:20.264 --> 01:08:21.435
I literally hate you.

01:08:22.733 --> 01:08:23.973
I hate you.

01:08:26.236 --> 01:08:27.236
Nature.

01:08:27.404 --> 01:08:28.609
Look at that.
That's like-

01:08:28.805 --> 01:08:30.149
a bird?
I think it's a crane.

01:08:38.148 --> 01:08:41.890
Hey, you okay?
Yes, I'm cool.

01:08:42.086 --> 01:08:45.430
You know she would have canceled
the show if she wasn't up for it.

01:08:45.622 --> 01:08:49.435
I know.
All right. Don't worry about it too much.

01:08:49.627 --> 01:08:50.799
I'm cool.
Let's go.

01:08:50.995 --> 01:08:51.995
Let's do this.

01:08:52.095 --> 01:08:53.904
Hey, you coming?

01:08:54.098 --> 01:08:55.975
Yes.
Let's go.

01:08:58.268 --> 01:09:00.509
A little more cultured.

01:10:32.730 --> 01:10:34.437
You okay?

01:10:34.665 --> 01:10:35.769
I'm sorry.

01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:51.218
Riley!

01:10:52.249 --> 01:10:53.751
Riley!

01:10:59.256 --> 01:11:01.634
Riley!
Riley, can you hear me?

01:11:11.101 --> 01:11:14.105
Riley!
Riley, can you hear me?

01:11:14.304 --> 01:11:16.875
Riley!
Riley, are you in here?

01:11:17.074 --> 01:11:19.054
Milow? Milow!

01:11:19.243 --> 01:11:21.621
Where?
Over here!

01:11:21.812 --> 01:11:23.189
It's you!
I thought they killed you.

01:11:23.213 --> 01:11:24.954
Are you okay?

01:11:25.149 --> 01:11:27.060
Get me the fuck outta here!

01:11:27.918 --> 01:11:29.898
Get me the fuck outta here!

01:11:30.087 --> 01:11:32.397
Where's Riley and Gia?

01:11:32.589 --> 01:11:33.829
They're dead.

01:11:34.057 --> 01:11:35.068
What?

01:11:35.092 --> 01:11:38.801
Those fucking bastards
killed them.

01:11:38.996 --> 01:11:40.805
Come on, let's
get the fuck outta here!

01:11:40.998 --> 01:11:43.274
Aah!
Get me the fuck outta here!

01:11:46.069 --> 01:11:48.069
The keys, the keys to the cage,
they're over there.

01:11:49.573 --> 01:11:51.613
Which one is it?
I don't know.

01:11:51.775 --> 01:11:53.253
You don't know
or you can't remember?

01:11:53.277 --> 01:11:54.277
I don't know.
Trinity!

01:11:54.411 --> 01:11:55.651
Which one is it?

01:11:55.846 --> 01:11:57.154
Gold? Silver?

01:11:57.347 --> 01:11:58.155
Everything's silver!

01:11:58.348 --> 01:12:00.089
Oh, my god.

01:12:00.284 --> 01:12:01.820
Get me the fuck outta here!

01:12:05.923 --> 01:12:07.493
Oh, come on!

01:12:09.593 --> 01:12:11.470
Trinity!
Which one is it?

01:12:11.662 --> 01:12:13.835
This one, I think.

01:12:14.031 --> 01:12:15.476
That's it!

01:12:18.302 --> 01:12:19.679
My leg! My leg! My leg!

01:12:28.779 --> 01:12:30.520
What the fuck?

01:12:33.951 --> 01:12:36.795
The bitches are loose.
I'll bring the gun.

01:12:39.523 --> 01:12:40.797
Fuck!

01:12:46.663 --> 01:12:48.165
Milow!

01:12:48.365 --> 01:12:50.072
Lester's gotta
be here somewhere.

01:12:50.300 --> 01:12:51.344
Just got to!

01:12:51.368 --> 01:12:52.369
Milow, we have to go.

01:12:52.569 --> 01:12:55.140
Not until I find Lester.

01:12:55.339 --> 01:12:56.579
Come on!

01:13:03.814 --> 01:13:05.384
Where are they?

01:13:05.582 --> 01:13:07.858
Do you see them?
I don't see a damn thing.

01:13:08.051 --> 01:13:09.428
Slow down.

01:13:14.992 --> 01:13:18.064
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

01:13:18.262 --> 01:13:20.708
We're gonna have some fun.

01:13:20.898 --> 01:13:22.536
We'll have a threesome.

01:13:22.733 --> 01:13:25.907
Yeah, that's it.
Come to papa.

01:13:29.206 --> 01:13:31.846
Where the fuck are they?

01:13:32.042 --> 01:13:33.282
I know they're here somewhere.

01:13:33.510 --> 01:13:34.887
Come on.

01:13:39.249 --> 01:13:40.455
There they are!

01:13:40.684 --> 01:13:41.958
Get 'em!

01:14:33.003 --> 01:14:34.141
Trinity!

01:14:40.644 --> 01:14:42.487
I'm coming for you, bitch.

01:15:20.384 --> 01:15:21.384
Fucking bitch.

01:15:51.014 --> 01:15:53.016
Where are you?

01:15:56.853 --> 01:15:59.163
Where the fuck are they?
Come on.

01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:31.657
Here I come.

01:19:06.743 --> 01:19:08.950
Where are you?

01:19:09.179 --> 01:19:11.750
Hey, asshole!

01:19:11.948 --> 01:19:13.052
Come here!

01:19:13.250 --> 01:19:15.355
Come and get me!

01:19:17.087 --> 01:19:19.761
Come on!
Come get it!

01:19:19.956 --> 01:19:21.936
Come on, I wanna play.

01:19:27.864 --> 01:19:29.434
Where are you?
Come and play.

01:19:29.633 --> 01:19:30.907
Hey!

01:19:31.101 --> 01:19:32.101
Fuck face!

01:19:37.807 --> 01:19:39.650
Come on!

01:19:39.876 --> 01:19:41.822
Come on!
Come on!

01:19:56.926 --> 01:19:58.963
Fuck you!

01:20:15.078 --> 01:20:18.855
Welcome to the dark, bitch.

01:20:35.765 --> 01:20:38.177
Lester! Lester!

01:20:38.368 --> 01:20:39.176
Lester!

01:20:39.369 --> 01:20:40.871
Lester! Lester!

01:20:41.104 --> 01:20:42.148
Gotcha!

01:20:42.172 --> 01:20:44.015
He wasn't gonna make it anyway.

01:20:44.207 --> 01:20:47.381
Oh, well.
Nothin' you can do now.

01:20:47.610 --> 01:20:48.384
Lights out.

01:20:58.555 --> 01:20:59.795
Give me back my dog!

01:21:00.390 --> 01:21:01.698
Give him back!

01:21:03.727 --> 01:21:06.640
Milow, stop!
Milow, look at me!

01:21:06.830 --> 01:21:08.673
Hey! Milow!
Look at me!

01:21:08.865 --> 01:21:11.072
Please look at here.
Look at me!

01:21:11.301 --> 01:21:13.338
No, this is not you.

01:21:13.536 --> 01:21:15.982
Hey!

01:21:16.172 --> 01:21:17.810
Look at me, look at me!

01:21:18.007 --> 01:21:20.817
Look at me.
Look at me!

01:21:21.010 --> 01:21:22.648
It's not worth it.
It's not worth it.

01:21:22.846 --> 01:21:25.520
It's okay, it's okay.

01:21:30.587 --> 01:21:32.396
Give it to me.

01:21:38.695 --> 01:21:42.700
Even with the upper hand, the only thing
you bitches are good for is breeding.

01:21:45.835 --> 01:21:47.246
Best thing for you.

01:21:51.875 --> 01:21:53.252
Trinity! Trinity!

01:22:02.919 --> 01:22:05.058
Fuck you!

01:22:34.617 --> 01:22:37.120
We've been at this
for what feels like days.

01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:38.320
There's nothing.

01:22:38.455 --> 01:22:40.628
We must be missing something.

01:22:42.992 --> 01:22:45.973
At this point we should just
give the footage to the police.

01:22:47.730 --> 01:22:49.505
Too late.

01:22:49.732 --> 01:22:50.732
Shit.

01:22:50.900 --> 01:22:53.005
Oh, my god.
It's all over the Internet.

01:22:53.236 --> 01:22:55.580
You've got to be
fucking kidding me.

01:22:55.772 --> 01:22:57.979
This jeopardizes everything!

01:22:58.174 --> 01:22:59.448
Fuck!

01:22:59.642 --> 01:23:00.347
Shit!

I'm not fucking kidding.

01:24:02.238 --> 01:24:05.242
Stay away!
I'm not fucking around.

01:24:05.475 --> 01:24:07.386
We're here to help.
We're just local folks.

01:24:07.577 --> 01:24:08.715
Stay away!

01:24:08.912 --> 01:24:10.892
Okay, we don't know
what happened,

01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:13.026
but we're gonna
get you some help, okay?

01:24:13.216 --> 01:24:14.524
I'm Miranda.
This here is Tucker.

01:24:14.717 --> 01:24:18.893
I live at 365 Tasker road,
Middletown, Missouri.

01:24:19.088 --> 01:24:20.931
All right?
Here.

01:24:22.025 --> 01:24:23.561
Now as a gesture of good faith,

01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:26.036
I'm gonna lower my gun,
so we can get you girls

01:24:26.229 --> 01:24:27.401
the help you need.

01:24:27.597 --> 01:24:28.735
We're not gonna hurt you.

01:24:28.932 --> 01:24:30.673
We're here to help.

01:24:30.867 --> 01:24:32.811
Okay? Are you okay
with us doing that?

01:24:32.835 --> 01:24:34.508
Tell us what happened.

01:24:42.445 --> 01:24:44.049
We went to this...

01:24:46.950 --> 01:24:49.226
We went to a rescue house
and there was this guy

01:24:49.419 --> 01:24:51.365
with a scar and he...

01:26:31.888 --> 01:26:35.233

01:26:35.458 --> 01:26:36.869
I don't know 'em.

01:26:37.060 --> 01:26:39.370

Yeah, I believe you do.

Yup, I agree.

Get over there!

01:26:48.071 --> 01:26:49.482

01:26:49.672 --> 01:26:51.083

01:26:51.307 --> 01:26:52.317

01:26:56.879 --> 01:26:58.654
Don't make another move,

01:26:58.848 --> 01:27:01.351

01:27:12.228 --> 01:27:14.003

They were called.

01:27:14.197 --> 01:27:16.837
Give them a minute.

01:27:17.033 --> 01:27:18.205
Milow, where are you?

01:27:18.401 --> 01:27:19.937
I'm so nervous.

01:27:20.169 --> 01:27:21.409

01:27:23.039 --> 01:27:24.245

01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:26.181
I don't know.
We'll find her.

01:27:28.845 --> 01:27:30.552
I'm too nervous.
I need to drink.

01:27:30.747 --> 01:27:32.249
Yeah, me, too.

01:27:32.448 --> 01:27:34.587
Yeah, this'll calm me down.

01:27:34.784 --> 01:27:36.957
There, that's fine.

01:27:37.186 --> 01:27:37.960
The phones still not ringing.

01:27:38.187 --> 01:27:39.632
It will ring.

01:27:41.224 --> 01:27:44.762
This is why I always
need to be with them

01:27:44.961 --> 01:27:46.634
when they go on the road.

01:27:46.863 --> 01:27:48.467

Yes, really.

01:27:48.698 --> 01:27:49.904
