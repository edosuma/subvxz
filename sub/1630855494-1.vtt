21:08.963 --> 21:10.965
-Gonna say nothing?
-What you want me to say?

21:11.052 --> 21:12.662
What the fuck was that?

21:13.228 --> 21:15.143
FBI robbery task force.

21:15.230 --> 21:16.362
No shit.

21:17.841 --> 21:20.279
-How'd they know?
-Someone ratted us.

21:21.932 --> 21:23.325
Who?

21:24.848 --> 21:27.590
We gotta wash this money.
Make sure our exit's
not burning,

21:27.677 --> 21:29.331
and get the fuck out.
Fast.

21:29.418 --> 21:31.246
Where we gonna run?

21:32.291 --> 21:34.162
This is gonna
make national news, Mick.

21:34.249 --> 21:35.685
We're fucking cop killers now.

21:35.772 --> 21:37.731
The choice is what?
You hear anybody yell,

21:37.818 --> 21:39.559
"Don't move, you're under
arrest"? No, you didn't.

21:40.995 --> 21:42.562
They were there
to fucking murder us,

21:42.649 --> 21:44.259
and I ain't got no regrets.

21:45.913 --> 21:48.089
We left, fucking,
three of our brothers

21:48.176 --> 21:49.743
in the fucking street!

21:51.571 --> 21:52.789
[beep]

21:53.964 --> 21:55.531
They made their choices.

21:56.227 --> 22:00.536
[suspenseful music]

22:02.190 --> 22:03.844
[engine starts]

22:21.775 --> 22:26.954
[suspenseful music]

22:27.041 --> 22:29.522
Two, I've already given
my statement to your paid men.

22:29.609 --> 22:31.437
-Gentlemen!
-You're probably not--

22:31.741 --> 22:33.090
Pace.

22:36.093 --> 22:37.530
So you're the one in charge
of this shit show.

22:37.617 --> 22:39.227
That's Special Agent
Frank Ross.

22:39.314 --> 22:41.403
Where the fuck were you,
Special Agent?

22:41.490 --> 22:43.927
I just got off a plane from
D.C. ten minutes ago.

22:44.014 --> 22:46.408
I've got six dead officers
and another one in critical

22:46.495 --> 22:48.715
because of your team's
cowboy shit.

22:50.020 --> 22:52.719
I understand, Lieutenant.
I do.

22:52.806 --> 22:54.329
It went bad
and we're here.

22:54.416 --> 22:55.852
We've gotta move past that now,

22:55.939 --> 22:57.985
so we can focus
on catching these guys.

22:58.333 --> 23:01.771
"Catch 'em."
It's New Orleans, Special Agent.

23:01.858 --> 23:04.208
We're gonna bury
these motherfuckers.

23:05.166 --> 23:08.517
Do your thing,
but don't go fucking shit
on my crime scene.

23:09.170 --> 23:11.651
Remember,
this is homicide first,
robbery second.

23:11.738 --> 23:15.481
I understand you're upset.
Emotional.

23:17.308 --> 23:19.006
You have every reason to be...

23:20.137 --> 23:23.314
But if you ever sling
foul language at me again,

23:23.402 --> 23:25.360
it will be your last.

23:26.448 --> 23:27.754
Understand?

23:29.408 --> 23:32.280
[suspenseful music]

23:34.413 --> 23:37.024
So, where we at on lockdown?

23:37.111 --> 23:39.983
In motion, boss.
Mayor's given us the keys.

23:40.070 --> 23:41.768
There are checkpoints
everywhere.

23:41.855 --> 23:43.596
[indistinct], the causeway,
all the ports,

23:43.683 --> 23:45.249
highways, bridges, roads

23:45.336 --> 23:46.816
-heading out the city.
-Marinas?

23:46.903 --> 23:48.209
Yes, sir. Everything.

23:48.296 --> 23:49.993
All right, all right.

23:50.690 --> 23:53.823
I want C.R.T. teams
and every precinct standing by.

23:55.042 --> 23:58.567
-So, what exactly happened?
-I got a call from my buddy
in Vice.

23:58.654 --> 24:01.396
Said he hooked a guy yesterday,
on some sort of statutory shit.

24:01.483 --> 24:03.703
Some nobody, Edwin Smalls.

24:03.790 --> 24:06.967
That cyber security geek is
looking at five to seven years
in Angola.

24:07.054 --> 24:08.534
Folded like a lawn-chair.

24:08.969 --> 24:10.492
They literally called us
ten minutes

24:10.579 --> 24:12.146
before the crew hit the place.

24:12.233 --> 24:13.539
I tried to phone you,
but I couldn't reach you.

24:13.626 --> 24:15.279
So... I made the call.

24:16.455 --> 24:18.935
So, tell me why we couldn't
take 'em at the van.

24:19.719 --> 24:21.590
Well, the block car
was in motion,

24:21.677 --> 24:23.070
and we were pushin' up.

24:23.462 --> 24:25.725
Crew came out heavy
like before, five and a driver.

24:25.855 --> 24:29.032
Body armor, ballistics, masks,
all automatic stuff...

24:29.119 --> 24:30.860
And then, fender bender

24:30.947 --> 24:32.688
right in front of us,
as we were moving in.

24:32.775 --> 24:35.082
Boris Karloff over there,
at the front door,

24:35.169 --> 24:36.910
came up on his sights.

24:37.650 --> 24:40.087
I beat him to the punch.
It was on.

24:40.609 --> 24:42.872
Nico took out the driver
of the van.

24:42.959 --> 24:45.745
Swat got the mummy over there
at the dumpster.

24:45.962 --> 24:48.922
So, I hear you winged a fourth.
You sure you hit him?

24:49.009 --> 24:51.402
Oh, I hit meat.
I heard the man howl.

24:51.490 --> 24:53.274
And, I tell ya,
there ain't no way he makes it

24:53.361 --> 24:55.929
through the night without
some serious medical attention.

24:56.016 --> 24:58.497
These guys are smart,
they're way too ruthless.

24:58.584 --> 25:02.239
Find out if there are any
doctors who've come up missing.

25:02.326 --> 25:06.069
Look into... vet offices,
plastic surgeons,

25:06.156 --> 25:07.549
anyone who can handle trauma.

25:07.636 --> 25:09.203
On it.

25:10.421 --> 25:12.467
You know how you've been saying
you thought these guys
were ex-military.

25:12.554 --> 25:14.730
-Yeah
-Yeah, well, you're right.

25:15.296 --> 25:16.819
We had them pinned down.

25:16.906 --> 25:18.734
and guess what those assholes
go and do?

25:18.821 --> 25:20.997
-Attack the ambush.
-Exactly.

25:21.084 --> 25:23.260
Wasn't till they realized
they were boxed in

25:23.347 --> 25:25.045
that they started to fall back.

25:25.393 --> 25:27.134
And the ranger peeled
all the way down the fence
and out.

25:27.221 --> 25:29.832
-Ranger peel?
-Yeah.

25:29.919 --> 25:33.227
Move, moving, covering,
all at high speed shit.

25:35.055 --> 25:37.753
I gotta tell you,
I haven't seen that live
since Somalia.

25:38.841 --> 25:43.454
-Go on.
-They jacked some kid
for his station wagon.

25:43.542 --> 25:45.152
Mark unit ran him down,

25:45.239 --> 25:46.806
but that just turned
into an ambush.

25:46.893 --> 25:49.939
at the switch car,
'bout, uh, six blocks over.

25:50.418 --> 25:54.857
All right. Get eyes out.
We're looking for something big.

25:54.944 --> 25:57.077
You know, something that
can carry all of them,

25:57.164 --> 25:58.687
something with power.

25:58.905 --> 26:00.994
We're talkin' a large SUV,
three-by-three, one ton.

26:01.081 --> 26:02.561
-Copy that.
-Yeah.

26:06.216 --> 26:07.914
Tell me about this van.

26:09.132 --> 26:11.700
Stole it. Three days,
out of Chalmette.

26:17.401 --> 26:19.099
-Nico
-Yes, sir.

26:20.666 --> 26:22.450
Who do we have over here?

26:22.537 --> 26:26.367
Bank tellers, managers
en route to University Medical.

26:26.454 --> 26:29.239
Heard he put up a fight,
and they tuned him up
pretty good.

26:29.326 --> 26:31.633
-Pssh... Not smart.
-No, sir.

26:34.767 --> 26:37.030
Hi. Now,
just one moment.

26:37.117 --> 26:40.381
Detective, do you mind
if I ask your witnesses
a couple questions?

26:40.468 --> 26:44.385
Seriously? I got a kid I was
supposed to pick up hours ago.

26:44.907 --> 26:48.171
-Go for it. I'm done.
-Thank you. Ladies...

26:48.258 --> 26:50.434
My name is Special Agent
Frank Ross.

26:50.521 --> 26:54.874
-Look... we just wanna go home.
-I understand. I do.

26:54.961 --> 26:57.833
I just need
a moment of your time.

26:58.399 --> 27:00.706
Do you remember anything...

27:00.793 --> 27:04.797
Anything specific about
the gunman who did this?

27:07.756 --> 27:10.803
-Two of 'em were Y'at.
-Y'at?

27:10.890 --> 27:12.631
I'm sorry, I'm sorry -I don't
know what a Y'at is--

27:12.718 --> 27:14.589
Metro locals. That Brooklyn
accent that you think

27:14.676 --> 27:16.460
you've been hearing around town?

27:16.547 --> 27:19.028
It ain't. That's a thing
we call Y'at.

27:19.115 --> 27:22.771
Okay. All right. Uh...
Which ones were Y'ats?

27:22.858 --> 27:24.860
The vampire and wolf.

27:24.947 --> 27:27.515
Okay. Thank you, thank you.
That's very, very helpful.

27:27.602 --> 27:28.690
Thank you very much.

27:28.777 --> 27:31.432
Ma'am, what about you?

27:31.519 --> 27:34.783
Did you see anything?
Do you remember anything?

27:35.915 --> 27:37.264
Ma'am?

27:38.004 --> 27:42.051
Guns. All I saw was guns.

27:44.053 --> 27:47.056
I mainly just kept my head down.
I didn't wanna...

27:47.143 --> 27:48.710
make eye contact.

27:49.929 --> 27:53.497
That was smart.
That was very smart.

27:54.150 --> 27:56.544
Okay, just breathe...
It's okay.

27:56.631 --> 27:58.677
-You're gonna be okay.
-[cell phone pings]

28:02.898 --> 28:04.770
Ex... excuse me, one moment.

28:11.341 --> 28:14.693
[girl] Dad, where are you?
I've been waiting forever.

28:14.780 --> 28:16.433
You're not coming, are you?

28:16.520 --> 28:19.175
Tomorrow morning
Works always first, right?

28:19.262 --> 28:21.482
-I should've known--
-Frank, I just got word...

28:21.569 --> 28:23.702
car fire on Chapitoulas.

28:36.062 --> 28:38.325
Ladies...
Thank you, thank you.

28:38.412 --> 28:41.720
Please don't hesitate to call
Detective here,

28:41.807 --> 28:44.635
if you remember
anything at all. Okay?

28:45.549 --> 28:48.422
All right?
Thank you all again.

28:49.597 --> 28:51.773
-Thanks, Agent Ross.
-Yeah.

28:54.428 --> 28:58.171
Get their details.
Run 'em all through local,
state, NCIC...

28:58.258 --> 29:00.216
-Will do.
-You drive.

29:01.261 --> 29:06.440
[suspenseful music]

29:14.796 --> 29:16.319
[pounding on door]

29:16.406 --> 29:18.713
-Who the f--
-Yo, Bill, open the door man.

29:18.800 --> 29:21.150
-Whoa whoa whoa whoa!
Bro...
-Yo, open the door, Bill.

29:21.237 --> 29:23.892
Whoa whoa whoa!
You can't bring him in here!

29:24.458 --> 29:26.416
Jeremy, this ain't how it works!

29:26.503 --> 29:27.896
[man gags]

29:28.027 --> 29:29.419
Tell me, motherfucker,
how's it work?

29:29.506 --> 29:31.247
How's it fucking work?

29:31.465 --> 29:33.380
-[man groans]
-Thought you'd rat us out,
didn't you?

29:33.467 --> 29:35.774
-Open your eyes,
I want you to see this.
-Hey, no no no.

29:35.861 --> 29:38.646
Come on,
he's as fucked as we are.
No no no, he fucking knew.

29:38.733 --> 29:40.909
He fucking knew.
You're the only one
who fuckin' knew.

29:40.996 --> 29:44.130
No, wrong. [coughs]
Smalls knew.

29:44.217 --> 29:46.785
-[coughs]
-What?

29:47.350 --> 29:50.571
When it hit the news,
I knew-- [coughs] I made a call.

29:52.181 --> 29:54.444
-NOPD picked him up
yesterday.

29:54.531 --> 29:57.012
-[coughs]
-Fuck.

29:57.665 --> 30:01.190
-We need another way out.
-Smalls didn't know
nothing about it.

30:01.277 --> 30:03.149
We don't know what the fuck he
knew, what he told him...

30:03.236 --> 30:06.587
-Hey, we need to wash
that shit ASAP.
-No can do.

30:06.674 --> 30:09.329
My guy's out.
Too much blood on it.

30:09.416 --> 30:11.722
-Blue blood.
-Oh, fuck that, fuck that.

30:11.810 --> 30:13.115
Tell him we'll give him
another bu--

30:13.202 --> 30:14.421
Tell him we'll give him
ten percent.

30:14.508 --> 30:15.857
[laughing] He's out!

30:16.031 --> 30:18.251
I don't care if you give him
100 percent!

30:18.338 --> 30:19.818
Jamie...

30:19.905 --> 30:21.558
It's too much heat.

30:21.645 --> 30:23.212
There's fucking
cash in a bag, right?

30:23.299 --> 30:25.562
Nobody's gonna fucking
clean that for us?

30:25.649 --> 30:27.303
[laughs] Yeah...

30:28.217 --> 30:31.742
The one guy I can dig up
that might be able to

30:31.830 --> 30:35.703
move that much weight...
[laughs]

30:35.921 --> 30:37.009
That's Nussy.

30:38.097 --> 30:41.840
And, boys,
the hit won't be light,

30:42.710 --> 30:47.541
Cause he's gonna take,
forty, fifty percent...
minimum.

30:49.412 --> 30:51.066
I mean, it is what it is, right?

30:52.459 --> 30:54.417
[Billy sighs]

30:55.288 --> 30:57.507
Fuck it. Make the fucking call.

30:57.594 --> 30:59.031
Yes, sir.

31:01.772 --> 31:04.079
Put your fucking guns down.
What the fuck!

31:04.166 --> 31:05.820
-Here we go-
Pearl, right?

31:05.907 --> 31:08.040
-What the fuck are you doin'?
-Fuck... you!

31:09.041 --> 31:10.869
You piece of shit.
You fucking coward.

31:10.956 --> 31:12.871
-Handle your business,
little bro--
-You fucking scum!

31:12.958 --> 31:14.524
I ain't got fucking time
for this--

31:14.742 --> 31:16.222
Fuck, you promised me, Jamie,
shit. You promised me--

31:16.309 --> 31:17.919
Get the fuck out of here.

31:18.006 --> 31:20.966
I'm gonna fucking kill you.
I'm gonna kill you.

31:21.053 --> 31:22.968
What are you doin'?!

31:23.577 --> 31:26.928
That psycho motherfucker
just killed us.

31:27.015 --> 31:28.843
Fuck! What was I thinking,
Jamie?

31:28.930 --> 31:30.889
We should've known better!
We should've known better.

31:30.976 --> 31:32.238
-[gasps] Fuck, Jamie!
-Hey.

31:32.325 --> 31:35.371
Joan! Joan!
The surgery was paid for.

31:35.458 --> 31:38.157
-Jamie, we had everything.
Jamie, everything is gone now.
-Shh... shh.

31:38.244 --> 31:41.203
-Stop.
-What... what?

31:41.377 --> 31:44.903
-What? [gasping]
-Come here.

31:51.431 --> 31:55.565
Listen. Hey... We're gonna
get through this, okay?

31:55.652 --> 31:57.698
All right?

31:58.612 --> 31:59.656
How?

31:59.743 --> 32:01.528
How? How do we get through this?

32:01.615 --> 32:02.833
I'm workin' on it.

32:03.008 --> 32:05.706
All right?
But you can't be here!

32:05.793 --> 32:08.404
We had a plan. You go home.

32:08.491 --> 32:10.232
You act like
everything is normal.

32:10.319 --> 32:13.540
You can't be around these guys,
all right?

32:15.368 --> 32:19.938
You need to listen to me.
The FBI's on you.

32:24.246 --> 32:25.552
They talk to you?

32:25.987 --> 32:29.077
Yeah, yeah. They were at
the bank for, like, hours.

32:29.164 --> 32:30.557
They talked to everybody.

32:30.644 --> 32:33.690
They're looking for guys
from the neighborhood.

32:36.041 --> 32:38.652
They're gonna find you, Jamie.
And... and...

32:38.739 --> 32:40.741
Listen... what if we just left.

32:41.220 --> 32:43.657
-What if we left right now...
and you came with me right now?
-Hey... Shh--

32:43.744 --> 32:45.267
-And we go get Joannie--
-Stop! Stop!

32:45.354 --> 32:47.226
And we get the fuck out of here.
You come with me...

32:47.313 --> 32:49.054
There's one thing
that's important. You go home.

32:49.141 --> 32:51.273
That's it.
Let me work!

32:51.665 --> 32:53.667
All right?
You trust me?

32:53.754 --> 32:55.060
-[man screaming]
-You know I do.

32:56.931 --> 32:59.107
I can't have this.
You gotta get him out of here.

32:59.194 --> 33:00.717
Shut the door! Shut the door!

33:00.804 --> 33:02.284
Jamie, he's gotta go!

33:02.371 --> 33:03.764
Where the fuck
am I gonna take him, Bill?

33:03.851 --> 33:06.201
-Let's take him to Clarence.
-[coughing]

33:06.288 --> 33:08.073
We ain't takin' him
to fucking Clarence's.

33:08.160 --> 33:10.118
Dump him at the E.R.
and hope for the best.

33:10.205 --> 33:12.425
-Take him to--
-Take him to fucking Clarence.

33:12.512 --> 33:13.774
I'm coming with.

33:13.861 --> 33:15.471
-What?
-Yeah.

33:15.732 --> 33:17.952
No you're fucking going home.
We just talked about this.

33:18.039 --> 33:21.129
I ain't leavin' you here
with this fucking psychopath.

33:23.044 --> 33:26.178
-Ava.
-No way! I'm not going home!

33:27.875 --> 33:29.877
You know what?
That's a great idea.

33:29.964 --> 33:32.271
Cops ain't looking
for no pretty brunette
from the Channel.

33:32.358 --> 33:34.229
Here! You drive!

33:41.671 --> 33:44.370
I'm not leaving your side
till this is over with.

33:45.806 --> 33:49.505
You fuck us...and I will be back
to murder you where you stand.

33:49.592 --> 33:50.898
We clear?

33:51.029 --> 33:54.032
-[suspenseful music]
-We're clear.

33:57.861 --> 33:59.211
[reporter]
The surviving assailants

33:59.298 --> 34:00.777
are believed to have made off

34:00.908 --> 34:03.128
with over one point five
million dollars.

34:03.215 --> 34:05.086
The New Orleans Police
Department,

34:05.304 --> 34:08.306
in conjunction with the FBI's
elite robbery task force unit

34:08.393 --> 34:10.351
have begun
an extensive manhunt.

34:10.438 --> 34:12.920
Setting up roadblocks
and checkpoints.

34:13.007 --> 34:15.444
Effectively shutting down
all access points

34:15.531 --> 34:17.489
both in and out of the city.

34:17.577 --> 34:19.882
If you, or anyone you know,

34:19.969 --> 34:21.885
has any information on
the whereabouts

34:21.972 --> 34:23.670
of these fugitives,

34:23.757 --> 34:25.802
the New Orleans Police
Department asks that

34:25.889 --> 34:27.543
you contact them immediately.

34:27.630 --> 34:29.154
But do not approach.

34:29.763 --> 34:32.853
The assailants are considered
armed and extremely dangerous.

34:34.246 --> 34:37.466
Now, let's go to George,
who's standing by
at University Medical,

34:37.553 --> 34:39.512
-awaiting an update
on the state,
-[phone buzzes]

34:39.599 --> 34:42.254
of the officers wounded
in today's heinous attack.

34:42.341 --> 34:45.170
-Yo
-[George over TV] Hank,
the situation at the hospital

34:45.257 --> 34:48.303
-Who's this?
- at the hospital
is extremely grim.

34:48.389 --> 34:50.391
-Oh, yeah.
- And with good reason.

34:50.478 --> 34:51.958
-Today's tragic events--
-Yo, Nussy.

34:52.045 --> 34:53.612
marked the deadliest incident--

34:53.699 --> 34:55.918
Got some fool on the line
that says you knows him.

34:56.659 --> 34:58.748
Told me to tell ya,
he's willing to chat.

35:00.228 --> 35:04.232
[television broadcast continues]

35:06.800 --> 35:09.542
The Jet,
what you want?

35:09.629 --> 35:12.414
[broadcaster] Some
arriving, still unaware.
of whether their loved ones

35:12.501 --> 35:14.068
Yeah, I'm lookin' at that shit
right now.

35:14.503 --> 35:17.115
These some straight up
mad motherfuckers,
right here.

35:18.855 --> 35:21.815
-Oh, yeah? Enlighten me.
-[news continues in background]

35:23.904 --> 35:28.343
[suspenseful music plays]

35:41.791 --> 35:43.967
It's a good location
to dump a car.

35:44.054 --> 35:46.100
You got 90 only seconds away,

35:46.187 --> 35:48.537
and the Irish Channel
to get lost in, right there.

35:49.843 --> 35:51.584
So, what's next?

35:52.933 --> 35:55.718
We flex this. Okay?

35:55.805 --> 35:56.893
So what do we know?

35:56.980 --> 35:58.678
Three shooters. One's hurtin'.

35:58.765 --> 36:00.723
Two of 'em are
probably local boys.

36:00.810 --> 36:02.377
All ex-military.

36:02.551 --> 36:05.685
Not just military...
these guys are gunfighters.

36:05.772 --> 36:08.862
We're lookin' for vets
with trigger time
in the sandbox.

36:08.949 --> 36:10.646
I'll get Jean
to reach out to DOD.

36:10.733 --> 36:13.171
-And I'll pull Jefferson
and Orleans' barrage.
-Good.

36:14.694 --> 36:16.478
So what exactly was the take?

36:16.565 --> 36:19.220
Walked out with three mil,
got away with one point five.

36:20.917 --> 36:23.659
What was a bank in East Calhoun
doing with that much cash?

36:23.746 --> 36:25.487
They just took over
the temp headquarters branch,

36:25.574 --> 36:28.186
because the CBD location
was going through a remodel.

36:29.491 --> 36:30.840
And today's Thursday.

36:31.711 --> 36:34.496
So, they were carrying
heavy prepping' for distribution

36:34.583 --> 36:35.976
to all the other branches.

36:36.063 --> 36:38.065
Cover all those
Friday payroll checks.

36:38.413 --> 36:39.980
And, how do they know all this?

36:40.067 --> 36:41.677
That's our job.

36:43.679 --> 36:46.204
You mentioned earlier,
an Edwin Smalls...

36:46.291 --> 36:48.380
That's right. The rat.

36:48.467 --> 36:50.643
Smalls gave them intel
and boards.

36:50.730 --> 36:52.035
What kind of boards?

36:52.122 --> 36:53.515
Some high-end, custom stuff,

36:53.602 --> 36:55.648
designed to trigger
the alarm system

36:55.865 --> 36:58.520
-to shut itself off 15 minutes
before the crew hit the place.
-Okay.

36:58.607 --> 37:01.306
I followed up on that
with the bank's security firm.

37:01.393 --> 37:04.352
They told me that they found
two odd, custom boards

37:04.439 --> 37:06.485
installed in the master CPU.

37:06.572 --> 37:09.531
They're polygraphing
the entire staff as we speak.

37:11.229 --> 37:13.840
So if Smalls hadn't talked,
they'd have gotten away clean?

37:13.927 --> 37:15.276
Hundred percent.

37:16.364 --> 37:17.626
Hmm...

37:18.236 --> 37:20.281
I wanna speak to this nobody.

37:20.368 --> 37:22.675
This Mr. Edwin Smalls.

37:29.508 --> 37:34.339
[suspenseful music]

37:42.869 --> 37:44.523
[knocks on door]

37:48.048 --> 37:51.312
Holy shit.
Get the fuck out of here.

37:51.834 --> 37:54.010
-We need you.
-[grunts]

37:54.097 --> 37:55.708
I got you. Come on!

37:55.795 --> 37:58.145
Get the hell in here! Quick!
Put him over here.

38:00.452 --> 38:02.367
Put him over here.
Put him over here.

38:02.454 --> 38:03.672
Sorry 'bout the mess, man.

38:03.846 --> 38:05.108
I was about to
clean this shit up.

38:05.195 --> 38:06.849
-[coughing]
-Put him right here.

38:08.024 --> 38:11.941
[breathes heavily]

38:15.902 --> 38:19.166
-Bullet hit him
under his armpit.
-[coughs]

38:19.253 --> 38:23.083
-His right armpit.
-His other right armpit,
Clarence!

38:23.170 --> 38:25.694
-Where the fucking blood is!
-Would you just chill out, man?!

38:25.781 --> 38:27.957
You got me so fucking rattled,
I can't even think straight!

38:28.044 --> 38:30.438
I got this.
Just let me do my thing!

38:30.525 --> 38:32.614
[woman]
Clarence! Who's that?

38:32.701 --> 38:35.356
-Who the fuck is that?
-[woman] Who you got in there?

38:36.531 --> 38:39.882
Ma! It's the pie guy.
He's just droppin' off a
pepperoni.

38:39.969 --> 38:41.667
[woman]
But I hate pepperoni!

38:41.754 --> 38:44.800
Yeah, I know!
It's not for you! It's for me.

38:44.887 --> 38:47.281
-You said you didn't want any.
-[man grunts]

38:47.368 --> 38:51.111
-That ain't no pie guy!
-Mom, just relax, okay?

38:51.198 --> 38:53.156
I'll be there in a bit
to rub your feet.

38:53.243 --> 38:55.681
-[woman] Really?
-I promise, Ma!

38:55.768 --> 38:59.467
Just watch your program,
and I'll be in there
before it's over.

38:59.685 --> 39:02.383
[grunts]

39:04.080 --> 39:07.736
-Yo, what the fuck
are you doin'?
-I--I--I need my bag.

39:07.823 --> 39:10.348
-What bag?
-It's a medical bag.

39:10.435 --> 39:11.958
It's green. It's about this big.

39:19.139 --> 39:21.620
-This it?
-That's it. Toss it here.

39:21.707 --> 39:24.013
Now, everybody
just give me my space,

39:24.100 --> 39:25.580
and let me do my thing.

39:26.581 --> 39:28.453
[cell phone vibrates]

39:32.587 --> 39:34.328
-It's Bill.
-Take it. I got it.

39:34.415 --> 39:36.809
-You got this?
-Yeah, I got it. Go go go go go.

39:36.896 --> 39:38.985
Hey, what's up?

39:40.595 --> 39:41.988
What you got?

39:42.684 --> 39:46.949
He's down, but it's a shit deal.

39:47.602 --> 39:49.038
Thirty cents on the dollar.

39:49.125 --> 39:50.910
Fuck, that's seventy percent.

39:50.997 --> 39:56.437
I know, but it's one of those
take-it-or-leave-it situations.

39:58.526 --> 40:00.136
Your call.

40:00.223 --> 40:04.532
[suspenseful music plays]

40:05.751 --> 40:08.841
-All right.
-How's the bleeding?

40:08.928 --> 40:11.974
Not good.
So how we gonna do this?

40:15.238 --> 40:18.720
This dude has lost
a shit ton of blood.

40:19.808 --> 40:21.201
My guess is the bullet
bounced off his shoulders,

40:21.288 --> 40:22.898
start gettin' down
to his stomach.

40:24.030 --> 40:26.249
His abdomen is distended,
and he's got a G.I. bleed.

40:26.336 --> 40:27.729
I ain't got time for this, Bro.

40:27.816 --> 40:29.514
Well, I don't know
what to tell you, bro!

40:29.601 --> 40:31.516
I'm a corpsman, man,
not a surgeon.

40:31.603 --> 40:34.867
Without real trauma care,
and even then-- I don't know!

40:34.954 --> 40:37.391
Ain't gonna happen,
can't happen.

40:43.441 --> 40:46.922
[suspenseful music]

40:48.358 --> 40:50.622
You make it go easy for him.

40:55.322 --> 40:56.454
Take it!

40:57.324 --> 40:59.587
[door opens]

41:05.071 --> 41:06.376
What's goin' on?

41:06.551 --> 41:09.249
Yeah, it's all good.
I--I did my thing.

41:09.336 --> 41:11.817
And, uh, he's in rough shape,
but the bleeding stopped.

41:11.904 --> 41:14.210
He just needs some time to rest.

41:14.297 --> 41:15.821
Well, we ain't got time
for no rest.

41:15.908 --> 41:17.779
You gotta get him fixed up,
ASAP.

41:17.866 --> 41:19.520
Get him over to Bill's house.
He can rest when we get there.

41:19.607 --> 41:22.305
-What's Bill have to say?
-Got a deal.

41:22.392 --> 41:25.091
-Twenty minutes
and we will know. You hear me?
-Yeah.

-Let's move. Let's go.
-Yeah.

-Take care of him.

we're done with this,

42:12.530 --> 42:14.444
I'm gonna drop you off
at St. Charles.

42:14.532 --> 42:16.316
You're gonna
take the street car home.

42:17.143 --> 42:18.579
When are you comin' home?

42:22.670 --> 42:24.106
I don't know.

42:27.066 --> 42:30.330
-So this is it?
-No, it's not it.

42:30.417 --> 42:32.593
All right? As soon as
the heat dies down,

42:32.680 --> 42:34.552
I'mma send for you and Joan.

42:38.991 --> 42:40.732

42:43.082 --> 42:45.737
You ain't never gonna
send for us.

If you make it out of this,
and that's--that's a big if...

You're gonna be running
for the rest of your life.

42:54.180 --> 42:55.964
I got a plan.

-What plan?
-Bolivia--

43:00.795 --> 43:02.318
-Let me explain--
-Bolivia?

43:02.667 --> 43:04.712
-Listen to me. Listen to me.
-Jamie, I don't even know--

43:04.799 --> 43:07.323
-I don't even know,
where the fuck that is, Jamie--
-Listen--

43:07.410 --> 43:11.632
It's in South America,
and there's this big lake
down there,

43:11.719 --> 43:16.376
Massive.
Right on the Bolivian,
Peruvian line.

43:16.463 --> 43:17.943
Right there on the border,

43:18.030 --> 43:20.032
surrounded
by the Andes Mountains.

43:20.119 --> 43:22.817
And, in the middle of
this big lake,

43:22.904 --> 43:26.560
there's this little island
called Isla de Sol.

43:26.647 --> 43:29.171
There's no cars,
no roads,

43:29.258 --> 43:31.783
Just fishermen and farmers.

43:33.828 --> 43:36.831
All right? You, me, and Joan
could start a life there.

43:40.835 --> 43:43.229
Just the three of us together?

-I love you.
-I love you.

-And I'd go anywhere with you.
-Yeah.

Fuck it.

Let's go get our fucking money,
come on.

44:57.695 --> 45:00.132
-You Brill?
-Who the fuck are you?

45:02.308 --> 45:03.875
I'm nobody.

45:03.962 --> 45:05.833
Funny,
I was just thinking that.

45:05.920 --> 45:08.314
Yo, let's just fucking do
this, 'aight?

45:09.010 --> 45:10.620
Check this shit out.

45:21.153 --> 45:23.242
-Good, brother?
-Yeah, we good.

45:23.590 --> 45:25.505
Yo, homie. You, uh...

45:26.680 --> 45:28.726
you're a little light,
don't you think?

45:29.248 --> 45:31.380
How do you figure?
That's five hundred K.

45:33.295 --> 45:36.124
-I'm sure it is.
-[Brill] That's thirty percent.

45:36.211 --> 45:39.084
-Yes, it is.
-Yo, that's what we agreed to.

45:40.781 --> 45:42.565
What the fuck did you just say?

45:42.652 --> 45:44.437
It's the only fucking deal
on the table.

45:44.524 --> 45:45.830
We didn't have no choice.

45:46.395 --> 45:47.919
What, you didn't think you need
to run that by me first?

45:48.006 --> 45:49.442
[Brill] Do we have a problem?

45:49.529 --> 45:51.313
Yeah, we got a fucking
problem, hold on.

45:51.574 --> 45:54.229
If you about that action,
just say the word.

45:55.230 --> 45:56.536
Yo, we're good!

45:56.623 --> 45:58.625
Aight?
Everybody, just calm down.

46:01.106 --> 46:03.021
[suspenseful music]

46:04.544 --> 46:06.502
You the smart White boy,

46:06.589 --> 46:08.722
best get your bitch in line--

46:08.809 --> 46:10.768
What the fuck did
you just say?

46:10.855 --> 46:13.118
You heard what the fuck I said!

46:14.380 --> 46:17.644
Yeah, fuck 'em.
Come on.

46:20.821 --> 46:23.432
All right, okay, All right.

46:24.564 --> 46:26.827
No, you're right,
it is what it is,

46:26.914 --> 46:29.090
-I apologize.
-[gunshots]

46:29.177 --> 46:31.963
[gunfire]

46:44.018 --> 46:45.063
Hey... you...

46:45.150 --> 46:48.196
[gurgles, chokes on blood]

46:50.546 --> 46:53.027
Come on, you're gonna
miss the best part.

46:56.770 --> 46:59.338
Yup. There you go.

46:59.773 --> 47:01.688
-[gunshot]
-What the fuck!

47:06.475 --> 47:09.391
[engine revs]

47:16.877 --> 47:20.011
Go, go, go, go!

47:28.149 --> 47:31.849
-[suspenseful music]
-[Ava] Oh, God.

47:31.936 --> 47:34.634
I knew it. I fucking knew it.

47:37.506 --> 47:40.509
Oh, shit!
All right. Get down.

47:42.816 --> 47:45.297
[suspenseful music]

47:46.994 --> 47:49.779
All right.
Don't do anything stupid.

47:50.128 --> 47:52.782
Yo, be cool. Mick.

47:55.394 --> 47:58.005
[indistinct radio chatter]

48:06.709 --> 48:09.321
[indistinct radio chatter]

48:09.712 --> 48:11.889
Six, thirty six, C.
Drop it to me.

48:15.544 --> 48:20.071
[suspenseful music]

48:22.987 --> 48:26.991
[siren blares]

48:43.572 --> 48:46.271
[sirens blare]

48:47.054 --> 48:52.625
Yo, Nussy. Boss.
I don't know how
to tell you this.

48:52.712 --> 48:55.584
-Tell me what?
-The meet went ugly.

48:55.671 --> 48:57.195
Brill's gone.

48:57.847 --> 48:59.066
What you mean "gone"?

48:59.153 --> 49:01.895
Gone. White boys executed him.

49:01.982 --> 49:03.810
Knocked off everyone.

49:05.812 --> 49:08.162
Nah. Not everyone.

49:09.555 --> 49:12.993
Nussy. Yo! Wait!
Let me explain.

49:13.994 --> 49:15.561
Nah, I can't hear nothin'.

49:15.648 --> 49:18.868
What?! 'How bout now?

49:18.956 --> 49:20.696
Nah, still nothin'.

49:20.783 --> 49:23.221
Wait, what? I don't get it.

49:23.830 --> 49:26.528
'Cause if I could hear you,
you'd be an apparition.

49:26.615 --> 49:27.965
A what?

49:28.966 --> 49:31.142
A fucking ghost, nigga.

49:32.099 --> 49:34.710
If I could hear you,
you'd be a motherfucking ghost.

49:34.797 --> 49:36.190
At least that's what
you're gonna be

49:36.277 --> 49:37.670
when Stitches
delivers you to me.

49:37.887 --> 49:40.455
So I can feed you
to the fucking alligators.

49:41.021 --> 49:42.588
Bitch ass nigger.

49:45.852 --> 49:47.245
You heard that?

49:47.332 --> 49:48.681
Yes, sir.

49:58.082 --> 50:00.519
[handcuffs rattle]

50:14.011 --> 50:17.275
Look man, I'm tellin' you,
I ain't wanna help him.

50:17.362 --> 50:19.799
Not one damn bit.
But I had no choice.

50:19.886 --> 50:22.845
-He put a fucking Glock
to my head.
-A glock?

50:23.716 --> 50:26.110
Yes, sir. Saw it written
right on the side.

50:26.197 --> 50:28.982
Had a shiny pearl handle grip.
It--

50:29.069 --> 50:32.333
Oh, yeah?
Did it have any engraving in it?

50:32.420 --> 50:34.814
You know on that...
shiny pearl handle.

50:34.901 --> 50:36.685
Yes, sir. Yeah, it did.

50:36.772 --> 50:38.992
Had a grim reaper
carved in on it.

50:39.079 --> 50:40.428
Really?

50:40.515 --> 50:42.865
That sound like something
you lie about?

50:42.952 --> 50:44.345
Then, they put the gun

50:44.476 --> 50:46.130
in my mouth,
and pulled back the handle.

50:46.217 --> 50:47.696
[Nicotra]
Wait, they put it in your mouth?

50:47.783 --> 50:49.481
I thought you said
they put in to your head.

50:49.568 --> 50:52.440
Look, he put it to my head,
then in my mouth.

50:52.527 --> 50:55.139
All right? Then the crazy
son of a bitches start arguing

50:55.226 --> 50:56.836
about which one's
gonna get to pull the trigger.

50:56.923 --> 50:58.359
-Holy shit!
-Mmm!

50:58.533 --> 51:00.144
Put it in your mouth,
and pulled it out...

51:00.231 --> 51:02.276
Man, I swear for God,
can you believe that shit?

51:02.363 --> 51:03.582
[Frank] No.

51:05.671 --> 51:07.020
No, I don't.

51:09.675 --> 51:10.937
Who are you?

51:15.550 --> 51:17.422
You ever heard
of the Pinocchio effect?

51:19.598 --> 51:21.643
The pokey no fect?

51:22.383 --> 51:24.690
No, no. [laughs]

51:25.604 --> 51:27.214
Pinocchio.

51:27.432 --> 51:31.175
You know, the cute wooden puppet
that wished he was a real boy?

51:31.697 --> 51:34.047
Every time he told a lie,
his nose would grow.

51:34.134 --> 51:35.831
Man, I told you.
I swear for God.

51:35.918 --> 51:38.007
What do I have to gain
from lying to you?

51:38.095 --> 51:40.227
You see, Edwin...
Mind I call you Edwin?

51:40.314 --> 51:41.489
You see...

51:41.968 --> 51:45.667
The Pinocchio effect is
when someone's lying,

51:45.754 --> 51:47.060
they know they're lying

51:47.234 --> 51:49.062
So they're working
as hard as they can

51:49.149 --> 51:51.064
to convince you,
that they ain't.

51:51.499 --> 51:53.849
They start babbling,
and going on...

51:53.936 --> 51:57.157
Start spitting out more details,
more words, than necessary.

51:57.244 --> 51:58.898
You know, shit like,

51:58.985 --> 52:01.248
'Do you think I'd lie
about something like that?'

52:01.901 --> 52:03.903
Or, 'What do I have to gain,
lying to you all?'

52:03.990 --> 52:05.383
Whoa.

52:05.905 --> 52:08.168
Wait... what do you think
I'm lying about?

52:08.777 --> 52:10.257
[Frank] Everything.

52:11.258 --> 52:15.349
For one, a Glock's
a polymer pistol. It's plastic.

52:16.176 --> 52:17.786
You can't add grips to it.

52:17.873 --> 52:19.919
Especially no pearl handle ones.

52:20.833 --> 52:24.793
And, second, it's a striker
fire, hammerless--

52:24.880 --> 52:27.492
Which means there's no hammer
to pull pack on, dumbass.

52:27.883 --> 52:29.407
-[grunts]

52:30.147 --> 52:31.539
[Nicotra]
What the fuck is wrong with you,

52:31.757 --> 52:33.150
you about to have a stroke
or something?

52:35.326 --> 52:37.545
I have neither the time
nor the crayons

52:37.632 --> 52:39.243
to explain all this to you.

52:39.852 --> 52:41.854
But, I'm gonna give it a go,
anyway.

52:43.290 --> 52:44.813
What you're unaware of is,

52:44.900 --> 52:47.033
earlier this afternoon,

52:47.120 --> 52:48.687
those crazy sons of bitches,

52:48.774 --> 52:51.559
that you supplied the intel
and the boards to,

52:51.646 --> 52:54.083
pulled a North Hollywood
shootout.

52:54.954 --> 52:59.045
They murdered six officers
and put another
in critical condition.

52:59.611 --> 53:02.788
Which makes you an accessory to,
at minimum...

53:02.875 --> 53:05.312
Six counts of capital murder.

53:08.533 --> 53:11.840
Now, you're realizing
the gravity of your situation.

53:11.927 --> 53:16.062
All right, look. I had no
fucking idea, all right?

53:16.149 --> 53:17.933
They were supposed to go in
on the prowl.

53:18.020 --> 53:19.631
Break in the night before.

53:19.718 --> 53:21.328
Look, I had no idea
they were gonna kill no one,

53:21.415 --> 53:23.722
-all right?
-I'm sure the state of Louisiana

53:23.809 --> 53:26.072
would really appreciate
that explanation.

53:29.554 --> 53:31.295
Oh, fuck me.

53:31.382 --> 53:33.862
Yeah, yeah, that's about right.

53:36.561 --> 53:38.476
All right, look, look...

53:38.563 --> 53:39.868
What can I do, all right?

53:39.955 --> 53:41.522
Tell me, tell me...
What can I do?

53:41.609 --> 53:43.655
Tell me 'bout your customers.

53:43.742 --> 53:46.266
These guys that put you
in this hole.

53:46.353 --> 53:50.139
Okay, it was, uh,
two White dudes.

53:50.227 --> 53:51.706
I think they might've
been brothers.

53:51.793 --> 53:53.273
How'd you come
to that conclusion?

53:53.969 --> 53:55.754
They kept calling each other
bro and shit.

53:55.884 --> 53:57.103
What are you, fucking Redman?
Who do you know in this city

53:57.190 --> 53:58.452
who doesn't call each other bro?

53:58.670 --> 54:00.237
It was different than that,
all right?

54:00.541 --> 54:01.934
Look I just-- I feel like
they were brothers. All right?

54:02.021 --> 54:04.066
-They kind of looked alike.
-Okay, okay.

54:04.153 --> 54:07.548
This is good. Tell me more
about these brothers.

54:07.635 --> 54:12.118
All right, uh, they, uh...
The younger one
was the smart one.

54:12.771 --> 54:16.818
Okay? And--and...
The older one was the mean one.

54:16.905 --> 54:18.864
What made the smarter one
smart?

54:18.951 --> 54:21.040
He was just--
all about business.

54:21.127 --> 54:22.650
He wanted
to know the details.

54:22.737 --> 54:24.304
Very specific about the details.

54:24.391 --> 54:25.653
And the mean one?

54:27.176 --> 54:28.613
Oh, oh, he was bad news.

54:31.616 --> 54:33.966
You know, some wild eyes.

54:34.053 --> 54:36.621
He's the type of guy
that's lookin' for any excuse

54:36.708 --> 54:39.667
to hurt someone.
All right? He told me,

54:39.754 --> 54:41.843
if I ratted on him,
he'd find me,

54:41.930 --> 54:44.281
and leave me twitchin'
in my own pile of shit.

54:44.368 --> 54:46.892
And... he was...
very, very specific

54:46.979 --> 54:48.589
about the pile of shit.

54:48.676 --> 54:51.679
Okay. I believe you.
Keep going.

54:51.766 --> 54:53.464
Okay... uh...

54:55.944 --> 54:59.861
The smart one
had a Saint Jude pendant
around his neck.

55:00.340 --> 55:01.428
And, uh...

55:03.038 --> 55:07.086
the mean one had a...
Marine corps tattoo.

55:07.173 --> 55:10.959
It said Semper Fi,
it had writin' on it.

55:11.656 --> 55:13.179
What did the tattoo say?

55:15.877 --> 55:18.619
It said Semper Fi somethin'
on the bottom,

55:18.706 --> 55:21.056
-And, then, Sheridan somethin',
on top.
-Say what?

55:21.143 --> 55:24.146
-It said Semper Fi
on the bottom.
-No no no... the name

55:24.233 --> 55:26.845
Oh, uh, Sheridan Raid,
or something.

55:26.932 --> 55:29.064
I remember 'cause of the tank.
Okay?

55:29.543 --> 55:31.719
-That mean somethin' to you?
-One second--

55:31.806 --> 55:34.853
So, should I have lawyer here,
or something?

55:35.506 --> 55:37.290
Norma, look,
I need you to drop everything,

55:37.377 --> 55:38.770
and run two names for me.

55:41.947 --> 55:44.166
Listen. I understand how
and why you built the boards.

55:44.253 --> 55:47.039
But, how did you know about
the Thursday deposits?

55:48.083 --> 55:49.868
How did you know that branch
was temping

55:49.955 --> 55:51.696
as a headquarter branch?

55:51.783 --> 55:53.785
Look, I don't know nothing
about no headquarter branch

55:53.872 --> 55:55.961
and no Thursday deposit either.

55:56.048 --> 55:58.267
Yeah, yeah.
Okay, send me that, right now.

55:59.660 --> 56:01.270
[cell phone beeps]

56:02.489 --> 56:05.318
-This them?
-Yeah yeah yeah.
Fuck yeah, that's them.

56:05.405 --> 56:08.016
Look, that's the mean one,
and that's the smart one.

56:15.023 --> 56:17.504
Hey, what's that mean,
what about... what about me?

56:17.983 --> 56:19.724
Man, what the fuck, man,
we good?

56:20.812 --> 56:23.292
Michael "Mick" Sheridan
and Jamie "James" Sheridan.

56:23.380 --> 56:24.859
Irish White trash
from the Channel.

56:24.946 --> 56:26.513
I popped Mick and his
younger brother years ago

56:26.600 --> 56:28.341
in an agg assault,
they damn near killed a guy.

56:28.428 --> 56:30.082
The brother walked,
but Mick got sent off to Angola

56:30.169 --> 56:31.605
for seven years.

56:31.692 --> 56:33.172
Both are ex-Marines
from the sandbox.

56:33.259 --> 56:35.435
All right, get a bulletin
to all of our agencies.

56:35.522 --> 56:38.220
-And get these photos
to the media ASAP.
-Copy.

56:38.307 --> 56:40.092
-Any word on the bank employees?
-Not yet.

56:40.179 --> 56:41.528
I'll rattle
Jean's cage again, though.

56:41.615 --> 56:43.051
Follow up now.

56:51.451 --> 56:53.453
-What happened?
-Mick happened.

56:53.540 --> 56:55.237
That's what the fuck happened.

56:58.327 --> 57:00.068
What is she talkin' about?

57:01.983 --> 57:04.638
And, Jamie...
Why do you have all the money?

57:04.725 --> 57:07.380
We had to move.
We had to dump it.

57:08.686 --> 57:10.688
Do you have any idea
who that was?

57:11.950 --> 57:15.910
That was Brill Waynes,
Nussy's brother.

57:15.997 --> 57:17.695
-[whispers] Nussy...
-We are so dead.

57:17.782 --> 57:19.479
It's okay. We're fine.

57:19.566 --> 57:21.220
Yo, we're better than fine.

57:21.307 --> 57:23.788
Everybody's share
just got a serious fucking bump.

57:23.875 --> 57:25.485
Where we at with the island?

57:26.530 --> 57:28.836
Hey, the passports,
where we at?

57:28.923 --> 57:30.185
[Jamie] What's the matter?

57:30.272 --> 57:31.622
You're not gonna be happy

57:31.709 --> 57:33.232
till we're all dead,
anyway, right?

57:33.537 --> 57:36.670
-What?
-[Jamie] Look, I get it.

57:36.757 --> 57:40.195
Mick, you've always wanted
a warrior's death.

57:42.415 --> 57:44.461
I ain't afraid of dying, bro.

57:44.548 --> 57:47.072
Yeah, no, no,
we all know.

57:49.161 --> 57:53.557
If we do get out of this,
we go our separate ways.

57:55.428 --> 57:57.474
We're never
gonna see each other again.

57:59.998 --> 58:02.261
-Bro.
-[Jamie] Don't bro me.

58:02.609 --> 58:04.829
You ain't thinkin' straight.

58:06.961 --> 58:09.268
I've never been more clear
in my whole life.

58:10.138 --> 58:11.836
Every pile of shit
I've ever stepped in

58:11.923 --> 58:13.011
is because of you, Mick.

58:22.542 --> 58:24.283
Who got you the money for Joan?

58:28.461 --> 58:30.768
Who got you outta
hell in Providence?

58:39.167 --> 58:42.040
How many beatings
I took for you from our old man?

58:45.522 --> 58:46.740
You owe me.

58:50.744 --> 58:51.745
No.

58:55.009 --> 58:57.098
After tonight, the debt's paid.

58:58.273 --> 59:01.320
Hey... Hey!
I'm your fucking brother!

59:02.582 --> 59:04.410
What, that don't mean
nothin' to you?

59:09.546 --> 59:11.286
This is about her, right?

59:13.462 --> 59:16.117
You gonna let that fucking bitch
come between us?

59:26.171 --> 59:27.476
Say that again.

59:29.043 --> 59:31.263
What? Bitch?

59:36.703 --> 59:38.096
[groans]

59:41.316 --> 59:42.666
[door opens]

59:43.884 --> 59:46.452
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Bro!

59:46.539 --> 59:49.498
Stitches, baby!
I was just about to call you!

59:56.201 --> 59:58.682
Two local men have been
identified as shooters

59:58.769 --> 01:00:00.988
in today's brutal bank robbery.

01:00:01.075 --> 01:00:03.774
Their names are
Michael Sheridan,
41 years of age,

01:00:03.861 --> 01:00:06.864
and his brother,
James Sheridan, 35 years.

01:00:06.951 --> 01:00:09.518
Both own extensive rap sheets.

01:00:09.606 --> 01:00:12.347
Both men are former
United States Marines.

01:00:12.434 --> 01:00:15.568
Having served deployments
in both Iraq and Afghanistan.

01:00:15.655 --> 01:00:18.049
The FBI robbery task force unit

01:00:18.136 --> 01:00:19.746
is said to be closing in
on them.

01:00:19.833 --> 01:00:22.314
As we report to you
this evening.

01:00:27.624 --> 01:00:30.148
All right, so I just
got off the line with Jean.

01:00:30.235 --> 01:00:31.845
Something did pop.

01:00:31.932 --> 01:00:34.152
One of those bank tellers,
that pretty brunette?

01:00:34.239 --> 01:00:37.764
Ava Rishoto,
she grew up in Irish Channel

01:00:38.809 --> 01:00:40.593
Now, she only had
a couple of dings

01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:42.029
in her sealed juvie record.

01:00:42.116 --> 01:00:44.249
-Such as?
-Petty theft at 13,

01:00:44.336 --> 01:00:45.729
and a P.I. at 15.

01:00:47.078 --> 01:00:49.515
Eh, there's more.
I told you Jean was digging.

01:00:49.602 --> 01:00:51.865
So he pulls the bank accounts
on all of 'em.

01:00:51.952 --> 01:00:54.651
And she's got over
75 grand in deposits.

01:00:54.738 --> 01:00:56.783
Three weeks after they
pulled that job in Metairie.

01:00:56.870 --> 01:00:59.481
-So, you followed the money?
-All digital.

01:00:59.568 --> 01:01:02.528
Something called, uh,
Secret Angels.

01:01:02.615 --> 01:01:04.269
It's one of those
anonymous sites

01:01:04.356 --> 01:01:06.227
where you
crowdfund sad stories.

01:01:06.314 --> 01:01:09.100
Now, all the money did go
to pay the hospital bills.

01:01:09.187 --> 01:01:11.450
And nothing else
looks suspicious.

01:01:11.537 --> 01:01:14.018
She's still carrying her house
and her car note.
But...

01:01:14.105 --> 01:01:16.760
those dates matchin' up
like that, that just...

01:01:16.847 --> 01:01:19.327
-makes for one hell
of a coincidence.
-Hey, Givens!

01:01:19.414 --> 01:01:21.112
-What you workin'?
-You ain't heard?

01:01:21.199 --> 01:01:23.157
-[Nicotra] Heard what?
-Narcotics on the scene.

01:01:23.244 --> 01:01:25.507
They've got six baggers
on the ground in Central City.

01:01:25.594 --> 01:01:27.509
-Look's like it's Nussy's group.
-How do you figure?

01:01:27.596 --> 01:01:28.815
Your boy Brill is one of 'em.

01:01:28.902 --> 01:01:30.469
When'd this happen?

01:01:30.556 --> 01:01:32.645
Shit, the bodies
ain't even cold yet.

01:01:32.732 --> 01:01:34.038
I gotta roll.

01:01:36.736 --> 01:01:38.042
What's a Brill?

01:01:38.129 --> 01:01:39.478
Only the little brother

01:01:39.565 --> 01:01:41.132
to the biggest gangsta
in the wards.

01:01:41.219 --> 01:01:43.003
-[Frank] Really?
-Yeah.

01:01:43.134 --> 01:01:45.614
[Frank] Big enough gangsta
to wash one point five mil?

01:01:45.702 --> 01:01:47.486
[Nicotra] He'll definitely
be on the list.

01:01:47.573 --> 01:01:49.009
Where can we find this Nussy?

01:01:49.096 --> 01:01:50.750
Well, he's got a club
over on Magazine.

01:01:50.837 --> 01:01:52.012
Show me.

01:01:59.367 --> 01:02:03.415
-[heavy breathing]
-[gun fire]

01:02:05.939 --> 01:02:06.984
[Ava] Jamie.

01:02:10.030 --> 01:02:13.904
[rapid gunfire]

01:02:14.469 --> 01:02:17.951
Jamie...
Jamie!

01:02:18.299 --> 01:02:22.390
-Jamie!
-[Mick] Yo, yo! Okay.

01:02:22.956 --> 01:02:25.916
-Hey...
-Jamie!

01:02:26.003 --> 01:02:28.135
-[Mick] You okay?
-Jamie.

01:02:29.528 --> 01:02:33.575
[Mick] Bro?
Hey, yo, yo, you good?

01:02:34.751 --> 01:02:36.143
You okay?

01:02:38.102 --> 01:02:40.191
Jamie, fucking,
I'm so fucking sorry, bro.

01:02:44.151 --> 01:02:46.980
Bro.
I'm so fucking sorry.

01:02:48.939 --> 01:02:50.462
I got this, bro. I do.

01:02:50.549 --> 01:02:52.333
I'm--I'm gonna tell 'em
it was me.

01:02:52.420 --> 01:02:55.249
You just ain't gettin' it, man.
No matter what you say,

01:02:55.336 --> 01:02:58.383
they're just gonna kill us,
anyway. [coughs]

01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:02.082
[coughs]

01:03:03.431 --> 01:03:04.693
Ava!

01:03:06.043 --> 01:03:07.566
Hey...

01:03:09.524 --> 01:03:13.354
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

01:03:15.313 --> 01:03:17.228
[door creaks]

01:03:32.765 --> 01:03:36.464
Hey, bro.
It wasn't them.
It was me.

01:03:37.204 --> 01:03:39.076
It was all me.

01:03:40.773 --> 01:03:41.948
Is that right?

01:03:44.995 --> 01:03:47.519
Hey,
there's more money than this,

01:03:47.606 --> 01:03:49.216
A lot more money.

01:03:49.303 --> 01:03:50.957
Oh, yeah?

01:03:51.479 --> 01:03:53.612
Yeah. Just let her go.

01:04:00.488 --> 01:04:03.448
-Yeah, this one?
-Yeah, even trade.

01:04:03.535 --> 01:04:06.320
-Hey, hey--
-Come on, man--

01:04:06.407 --> 01:04:07.713
Hey!

01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:10.020
Even fuckin' trade, man.
A million cash,

01:04:10.107 --> 01:04:13.371
-I stashed it.
-[whimpers]

01:04:15.329 --> 01:04:17.244
No, it ain't gonna happen.

01:04:17.331 --> 01:04:18.550
Come on, what the fuck's
wrong with you?

01:04:18.637 --> 01:04:20.117
-It's a million dollars.
-No, it ain't.

01:04:20.987 --> 01:04:22.902
Brill already
told me what you left him.

01:04:24.382 --> 01:04:26.601
That's all you got right there.

01:04:27.254 --> 01:04:29.430
Plus, my boy Stitches
over there...

01:04:29.517 --> 01:04:31.998
[chuckles] that motherfucker

01:04:32.085 --> 01:04:33.957
got somethin' wicked
for her ass.

01:04:34.044 --> 01:04:36.002
[chair scrapes against floor]

01:04:36.089 --> 01:04:37.917
Hold on, princess.

01:04:42.617 --> 01:04:44.271
Hey, yo, motherfucker,

01:04:46.883 --> 01:04:51.800
it was me that dumped
your little bitch ass brother.

01:04:54.803 --> 01:04:57.023
Oh, yeah.
You should've heard him.

01:04:58.329 --> 01:05:00.592
Begged me. Whimpered.

01:05:00.679 --> 01:05:03.551
Cried like
a little fucking bitch.

01:05:05.205 --> 01:05:07.904
Until I jammed
that .45 in his mouth.

01:05:11.385 --> 01:05:12.560
Hey, yo, homie.

01:05:13.953 --> 01:05:16.303
You know anything
about the terminal effects

01:05:16.390 --> 01:05:17.914
of contact shots?

01:05:20.786 --> 01:05:24.094
No?
That's a big word.

01:05:24.833 --> 01:05:26.313
You see,

01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:29.751
with the terminal
effects of contact shots,

01:05:29.838 --> 01:05:33.755
the body body absorbs
all the discharge
from the round.

01:05:34.713 --> 01:05:36.323
Not just the fucking bullet.

01:05:38.282 --> 01:05:39.805
All those gasses...

01:05:39.892 --> 01:05:41.894
expanding that fucking fast?

01:05:41.981 --> 01:05:43.591
Whoo!

01:05:44.114 --> 01:05:47.030
That's some savage,
ugly shit, bro.

01:05:49.989 --> 01:05:52.078
You gotta trust me on this one.

01:05:52.165 --> 01:05:54.124
Your little brother Brill...

01:05:56.039 --> 01:05:58.302
That's gonna be a closed casket.

01:06:08.486 --> 01:06:10.836
[laughs]

01:06:13.447 --> 01:06:14.971
[exhales]

01:06:15.710 --> 01:06:18.539
Well, I smell
the vapors of hell on you, boy.

01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:25.242
You good,
but you're not gonna play me.

01:06:26.286 --> 01:06:30.029
No. I'm--I'mma savor the moment.

01:06:31.335 --> 01:06:34.425
Got plans for you.
Take my time.

01:06:35.295 --> 01:06:39.430
Make it a few nights, even.
[laughs]

01:06:41.258 --> 01:06:43.434
See that container over there?

01:06:45.523 --> 01:06:47.655
Know y'all been wondering
what that is, all night, huh?

01:06:48.830 --> 01:06:52.051
That's a hundred gallons
of sulfuric acid.

01:06:56.795 --> 01:07:01.539
Turn a man into soup in minutes.
Real wicked shit.

01:07:02.496 --> 01:07:04.846
Yeah, I got that
from my Mexican friends.

01:07:05.804 --> 01:07:08.067
They got it goin' on.
[chuckles]

01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:15.683
Hey, yo, Stitches.

01:07:15.770 --> 01:07:18.425
Let's show these fools
a little demo real quick.

01:07:18.730 --> 01:07:20.514
Get their fucking mind right.

01:07:24.953 --> 01:07:27.304
I just want you to know
it's about to get real noisy
in here.

01:07:27.391 --> 01:07:29.262
-[bubbling]
-Real noisy.

01:07:35.529 --> 01:07:38.054
No no no no no no.
God, god, no, please.

01:07:38.141 --> 01:07:40.404
Wait, wait.
Jamie, Jamie, Jamie.

01:07:40.491 --> 01:07:42.275
-Jamie, stop him--
-Hey, hey, come on, man.

01:07:42.362 --> 01:07:44.451
Hey! Hey! There's more money--

01:07:44.538 --> 01:07:45.800
-Jamie, stop him!
-Hey, look at me, man.

01:07:45.887 --> 01:07:47.019
There's more
fuckin' money, man.

01:07:47.106 --> 01:07:49.761
Jamie, stop him!
Jamie! Jamie!

01:07:49.848 --> 01:07:51.545
You don't have to do this!

01:07:52.155 --> 01:07:55.027
Ah! Ah! Ah!

01:07:55.723 --> 01:07:57.812
No! No, no!

01:07:57.899 --> 01:08:00.859
-[screaming]
-No! Fuckin' no!

01:08:00.946 --> 01:08:02.556
-[screaming]
-[sizzling]

01:08:02.643 --> 01:08:05.255
-Ahh!
-Take that, motherfucker.

01:08:05.342 --> 01:08:07.126
Take it. Take it like a champ!

01:08:07.518 --> 01:08:09.650
[screaming continues]

01:08:10.956 --> 01:08:13.393
You motherfucker!
I'm gonna fucking murder you!

01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:16.135
That's what I'm talkin' bout!
Ooh-whee!

01:08:17.093 --> 01:08:18.703
-This how you get
a party started!
-[Ava cries]

01:08:18.790 --> 01:08:21.270
You're gonna wish
you murdered me first.

01:08:25.796 --> 01:08:30.106
So the Jet tells me,
that ya'll are brothers.

01:08:31.933 --> 01:08:34.761
You the younger brother?
Am I wrong?

01:08:45.207 --> 01:08:49.167
[suspenseful music plays]

01:08:50.996 --> 01:08:52.475
Hey, Stitches!

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:56.219
Let me have a go at it.

01:09:01.136 --> 01:09:05.576
[Ava hyperventilates]

01:09:06.446 --> 01:09:09.580
No, Mick, do something, Mick.
Do something.

01:09:09.667 --> 01:09:11.886
Hey, hey! No, no, no, no.

01:09:13.060 --> 01:09:17.675
No, don't do that!
No, no, no!

01:09:19.938 --> 01:09:22.287
This is what you wanted, huh?

01:09:22.375 --> 01:09:24.116
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:09:24.812 --> 01:09:26.423
Shut the fuck up!

01:09:26.510 --> 01:09:28.555
It's okay. It's okay.

01:09:30.296 --> 01:09:35.301
[suspenseful music]

01:09:37.477 --> 01:09:40.872
[Ava wails hysterically]

01:09:44.136 --> 01:09:46.834
Ah! Ah!

01:09:56.801 --> 01:09:59.107
[glass shatters]

01:10:01.980 --> 01:10:04.287
[grunting]

01:10:10.467 --> 01:10:13.209
[grunting]

01:10:13.296 --> 01:10:16.386
Okay, okay, you--

01:10:17.256 --> 01:10:19.563
[chemical bubbling]

01:10:23.306 --> 01:10:26.831
[Nussy gasping]

Didn't I tell you,
you were gonna wish

So, how is she doing?

01:28:48.235 --> 01:28:50.673
I heard that she
had a surgery recently.

Last spring.
She's doin' good.

probably gonna be fine.

Oh, that's good to hear.

01:29:03.773 --> 01:29:06.123
A congenital heart disorder...

01:29:07.385 --> 01:29:09.039
I heard that surgery
is very expensive

01:29:09.126 --> 01:29:10.954
to cover all those costs...

01:29:11.563 --> 01:29:13.913
We were blessed.
We crowdfunded,

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:17.177
and a lot of generous people
came to our rescue.

01:29:18.657 --> 01:29:21.399
But you already knew that,
didn't you, Special Agent.

01:29:21.486 --> 01:29:23.183
You just said "we".

01:29:23.270 --> 01:29:24.881

That was incredibly
generous.

And the donors?
They're all anonymous?

01:29:35.282 --> 01:29:37.589

-People can really surprise you.
-And the father?

01:29:42.464 --> 01:29:45.641
He's not around anymore.
He's gone.

01:29:45.815 --> 01:29:47.207
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:29:48.470 --> 01:29:52.517

just aren't meant to be.

-She's beautiful.
-Yeah, I think so, too.

01:30:12.145 --> 01:30:16.585

a sadness in her eyes.

You know, her mother and I...

01:30:30.990 --> 01:30:33.036
were just a really bad match.

A bad match that caused
my daughter a lot of pain.

01:30:38.694 --> 01:30:42.567

that doesn't scar her too badly.

-Can I give you
a piece of advice?

You seem like a smart man,

you ain't figured out yet.

-Really?
-[laughs] Yeah...

lettin' me down.

But it don't matter,
'cause he still my daddy.

Every little girl needs one.
It's just how it is.

01:31:18.124 --> 01:31:21.040
Yeah, it might take us
a while to figure that out,

01:31:21.127 --> 01:31:23.608
but we always do.

01:31:24.696 --> 01:31:27.482
And, really, your job...
is simple.

01:31:28.178 --> 01:31:30.049
Do what you can
to own your shit.

01:31:30.136 --> 01:31:34.184
Try to make up for it.
And just wait for her.

01:31:35.533 --> 01:31:37.056
"Wait"?

01:31:37.970 --> 01:31:40.407
Yeah. Wait. That's it.

01:31:40.495 --> 01:31:42.366
Don't ever give up.

01:31:44.194 --> 01:31:47.937
Is that what your father did?
Wait?

01:31:49.982 --> 01:31:52.768
No. He didn't.

01:31:56.989 --> 01:32:00.993
You said that the only option
you have was to

01:32:01.080 --> 01:32:03.866
just hope your little girl
will be okay.

01:32:04.431 --> 01:32:06.216
That ain't the way I see it.

01:32:06.999 --> 01:32:08.914
You could just choose
to leave your ex

01:32:09.001 --> 01:32:11.003
where she should
be, in the past.

01:32:11.090 --> 01:32:13.963
And focus on starting over
with your daughter.

01:32:18.402 --> 01:32:20.230
Hmm. You know...

01:32:23.189 --> 01:32:25.278
that's really excellent advice.

01:32:33.896 --> 01:32:36.986
It's been lovely chatting
with you, Special Agent Ross.

01:32:38.553 --> 01:32:40.859
I hope you have a better day.

01:32:44.515 --> 01:32:46.561
Good luck, Mrs. Rishoto.

01:32:47.649 --> 01:32:48.998
Hey...

01:32:50.608 --> 01:32:51.870
Thank you.

01:33:06.755 --> 01:33:09.453
-How'd that go?
-It went.

01:33:09.540 --> 01:33:11.411
And what about her?

01:33:14.850 --> 01:33:17.417
Bad guys are dead.
All the money's recovered.

01:33:17.504 --> 01:33:19.115
It's over.

01:33:19.202 --> 01:33:22.814
Yeah, we could charge her,
absolutely ruin her.

01:33:23.162 --> 01:33:25.208
And her daughter would probably
get put in the system.

01:33:33.216 --> 01:33:36.872

-I'll be in the car.

Hi.

01:35:02.261 --> 01:35:03.698
It's a beautiful day.

01:35:31.073 --> 01:35:33.423
I've got somebody
I want you to meet.

01:35:33.510 --> 01:35:35.730
Somebody real special.

01:35:36.774 --> 01:35:38.384
