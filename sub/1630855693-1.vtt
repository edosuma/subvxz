00:00.868 --> 00:03.537
(gentle music)

00:14.582 --> 00:18.052
(gentle music continues)

00:25.193 --> 00:28.662
(gentle music continues)

00:51.419 --> 00:52.686
- [Dan Voiceover] The
film you're about to see

00:52.686 --> 00:54.188
is not based on any
real life events.

00:54.188 --> 00:55.889
The actors playing the
zombies in this movie,

00:55.889 --> 00:57.358
were not in any way transformed,

00:57.358 --> 00:59.760
mutated or surgically
turned into actual zombies.

00:59.760 --> 01:00.894
This is not real.

01:00.894 --> 01:02.196
If you at any point
feel like they are real,

01:02.196 --> 01:03.097
just keep repeating.

01:03.097 --> 01:04.132
It's only a movie.

01:04.132 --> 01:05.099
It's only a movie.

01:05.099 --> 01:06.467
It's only a movie.

01:06.467 --> 01:09.270
(dramatic music)

01:21.982 --> 01:24.452
(screaming)

01:24.452 --> 01:26.287
- Missy, come on.

01:26.287 --> 01:27.455
(dramatic music)

01:27.455 --> 01:28.622
Come on, they're
right behind us.

01:28.622 --> 01:29.657
Come on.

01:29.657 --> 01:32.460
(dramatic music)

01:36.430 --> 01:38.299
They're all infected.

01:38.299 --> 01:40.501
Who else isn't anywhere?

01:40.501 --> 01:43.271
- In here, come on,
let's go in here.

01:43.271 --> 01:45.973
(dramatic music)

01:48.576 --> 01:51.945
(both panting)

01:51.945 --> 01:54.648
(dramatic music)

02:00.288 --> 02:01.555
No we're trapped.

02:01.555 --> 02:02.890
- No, there's a stone staircase.

02:02.890 --> 02:04.292
- Okay go, let's go.

02:04.292 --> 02:07.895
(dramatic music)

02:07.895 --> 02:09.029
- Good work.

02:09.029 --> 02:11.232
You must be the last ones.

02:11.232 --> 02:12.533
Did you bring the canisters?

02:12.533 --> 02:13.467
- Canisters?

02:13.467 --> 02:15.436
Mr. we're in really big trouble.

02:15.436 --> 02:17.938
The Canisters child,
we're lost without them.

02:17.938 --> 02:19.440
Don't you know that?

02:19.440 --> 02:20.474
(dramatic music)

02:20.474 --> 02:22.276
(zombies moaning)

02:22.276 --> 02:23.677
Look out now, just
get behind me.

02:23.677 --> 02:24.712
(zombies moaning)

02:24.712 --> 02:26.046
(Missy screaming)

02:26.046 --> 02:28.949
(zombies moaning)

02:30.384 --> 02:33.221
(dramatic music)

02:39.860 --> 02:44.097
- Ah, ha, ha, ah, ah no, no.

02:44.097 --> 02:45.533
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

02:45.533 --> 02:46.367
Yep.

02:46.367 --> 02:48.202
(dramatic music)

02:48.202 --> 02:51.071
No, no, that's a
little too close.

02:51.071 --> 02:52.506
(dramatic music)

02:52.506 --> 02:54.775
Hey, hey, hey, hey, easy there.

02:54.775 --> 02:57.578
(dramatic music)

03:03.817 --> 03:05.686
- We good?

03:05.686 --> 03:07.321
Woo, scary stuff.

03:07.321 --> 03:10.324
Well that was a scene
from 1978's, "Night
of the Mausoleum."

03:10.324 --> 03:12.993
Produced right here in our
very town of Carverville.

03:12.993 --> 03:15.162
That's right,
director Len Carver.

03:15.162 --> 03:18.232
The same carver that Mayor
Winslow renamed our town for.

03:18.232 --> 03:20.901
Well, Carver has his first
new zombie movie coming out

03:20.901 --> 03:22.470
in over 30 years.

03:22.470 --> 03:24.004
No one knows anything about it,

03:24.004 --> 03:26.374
except it'll premiere here
exclusively in Carverville

03:26.374 --> 03:28.742
tomorrow, on
Halloween night, ooh.

03:28.742 --> 03:30.244
Well, I'm currently
standing here

03:30.244 --> 03:32.646
in front of his Majestic
home on Washington Street

03:32.646 --> 03:34.382
to see if we can
catch a glimpse,

03:34.382 --> 03:36.950
maybe even an interview
with the reclusive director.

03:36.950 --> 03:39.052
As you can see, people have
been waiting a long time

03:39.052 --> 03:40.588
for him to release a new movie,

03:40.588 --> 03:42.856
and the demand for a new film
has reached an all time high.

03:42.856 --> 03:45.125
You guys must be fans
of Carver's films.

03:45.125 --> 03:47.828
- Carver, he's the greatest
director in cinema history,

03:47.828 --> 03:48.662
the greatest.

03:48.662 --> 03:49.597
(Chance laughing)

03:49.597 --> 03:50.798
- You, you, actually mean

03:50.798 --> 03:51.932
greatest horror
film director, huh?

03:51.932 --> 03:53.267
- [All] No.

03:53.267 --> 03:54.768
- The greatest period.

03:54.768 --> 03:56.036
Dude, what is wrong with you.

03:56.036 --> 03:58.706
- Don't disrespect
the master like that.

03:58.706 --> 04:00.441
(people speaking indistinctly)

04:00.441 --> 04:02.376
- Well, since we don't think
we'll likely get an interview

04:02.376 --> 04:03.844
with the director today,

04:03.844 --> 04:07.180
let's cut to the last interview
he had, 30 years ago, today.

04:08.316 --> 04:11.084
- So, yeah, no,

04:11.084 --> 04:12.486
I won't be making
any more films.

04:12.486 --> 04:13.387
(camera shutters clicking)

04:13.387 --> 04:15.255
- [Fans] No.

04:15.255 --> 04:16.524
- Settle down, relax.

04:16.524 --> 04:18.058
What do you want from me?

04:18.058 --> 04:21.094
I, I, I just wanna retire to
my estate and be left alone.

04:21.094 --> 04:22.330
Okay, thank you.

04:23.431 --> 04:25.198
- Sir, sir, sir, Mr.
Carver, you must have

04:25.198 --> 04:27.167
one more movie in you, sir.

04:27.167 --> 04:30.538
Can you at least sign my,
"Hockey Zombie Patrol" poster?

04:30.538 --> 04:32.139
- Get a life.

04:32.139 --> 04:35.343
Just, I'm, I'm so tired
of this, okay, all of you,

04:35.343 --> 04:36.844
just forget it.

04:36.844 --> 04:38.045
- Well, Carver's made it known

04:38.045 --> 04:39.547
that he won't be
promoting his new movie

04:39.547 --> 04:41.048
through media junkets.

04:41.048 --> 04:42.983
So the town will just have
to see it on opening night.

04:42.983 --> 04:44.618
- [Fan] His ugly,
tired, ugly shirts.

04:44.618 --> 04:45.453
- Stop it.

04:45.453 --> 04:46.920
Get back.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.055
- [Fan] He's the greatest
director of all time.

04:48.055 --> 04:49.490
- One of Carver's biggest fans

04:49.490 --> 04:52.292
is also a Carverville's
Theater owner, Richard Landro.

04:52.292 --> 04:53.594
- Ow.

04:53.594 --> 04:56.797
So, Mr. Carver
himself contacted me

04:56.797 --> 04:59.833
through the, the, the email.

05:00.568 --> 05:02.603
He trusts me, of course,

05:02.603 --> 05:04.171
we were good friends
in high school.

05:04.171 --> 05:06.039
And he's a wonderful, wonderful.

05:06.039 --> 05:11.111
And he specifically told me
to encourage the entire town

05:12.312 --> 05:14.515
to attend the premier,

05:14.515 --> 05:18.452
and he was going to
be present himself

05:18.452 --> 05:22.823
to present his, his
new masterpiece.

05:22.823 --> 05:25.959
It's gonna be, it's gonna
be a great, great night.

05:25.959 --> 05:27.528
I mean, I wouldn't
wanna miss it.

05:27.528 --> 05:29.229
I, I, I would suggest bring one.

05:29.229 --> 05:31.432
- I can't believe it,
that's your boss on TV.

05:31.432 --> 05:33.133
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

05:33.133 --> 05:35.035
I've heard enough about
this stupid movie.

05:35.035 --> 05:36.370
- The report isn't over yet.

05:36.370 --> 05:38.506
- Amy, it's over.
- Nice.

05:38.506 --> 05:39.907
- Pay more attention
to your history test,

05:39.907 --> 05:42.009
you're supposed to
be studying for.

05:42.009 --> 05:43.343
- Mike, you're not my mom.

05:43.343 --> 05:44.878
But thank you so much
for always caring

05:44.878 --> 05:46.246
about me and my grades.

05:46.246 --> 05:47.415
That's why I love you.

05:50.584 --> 05:51.452
Like a brother

05:51.452 --> 05:53.053
and a study partner.

05:53.053 --> 05:54.522
- Thank God.

05:54.522 --> 05:55.789
Weirdo.

05:55.789 --> 05:57.257
- Besides when you
get into Caltech,

05:57.257 --> 05:59.560
who will I have to study with?

05:59.560 --> 06:02.563
- Look, if I get
into any university,

06:02.563 --> 06:03.797
I'm outta this cruddy town.

06:03.797 --> 06:05.298
- Yeah, yeah.

06:05.298 --> 06:07.267
Here we go again with how
much you hate the town.

06:07.267 --> 06:09.570
God, Mike, give it a rest.

06:09.570 --> 06:12.039
- I told you, the only
thing is town values

06:12.039 --> 06:14.341
are Len Carver horror films.

06:14.341 --> 06:15.509
- Take a pill, dude.

06:15.509 --> 06:17.210
He's awesome, you're
just not cool.

06:18.345 --> 06:19.947
- Because I don't
like crap movies?

06:19.947 --> 06:22.082
- No, because you're a wuss.

06:22.082 --> 06:24.518
- Look, I'm just
not a horror fan.

06:24.518 --> 06:25.919
- Because you're a wuss.

06:25.919 --> 06:26.754
- Yeah whatever.

06:26.754 --> 06:28.088
See you at school.

06:30.691 --> 06:32.059
Hi, I'm late again.

06:33.527 --> 06:36.296
- Mike, I saw your boss
on the news this morning.

06:38.198 --> 06:40.534
Are you working
tomorrow at the theater?

06:40.534 --> 06:42.235
They're showing a
zombie movie, Mike,

06:42.235 --> 06:44.638
I know how much you
love zombie movies.

06:44.638 --> 06:45.606
- Funny.

06:47.007 --> 06:51.311
Mom, when are we moving
outta this stupid town?

06:51.311 --> 06:52.212
- Hey.

06:53.280 --> 06:54.281
Excuse me.

06:55.282 --> 06:57.518
What did we say about that?

06:57.518 --> 06:58.418
Mike.

07:00.187 --> 07:04.224
This town is your
home, Mike, okay.

07:05.025 --> 07:07.861
You just need to figure out.

07:09.062 --> 07:11.298
- What it is that
I love about it.

07:11.298 --> 07:12.733
Yes, yes.

07:15.202 --> 07:16.069
Right.

07:17.705 --> 07:18.539
Which is nothing.

07:18.539 --> 07:19.773
Love you, bye.

07:22.242 --> 07:23.443
- You forgot your lunch.

07:23.443 --> 07:24.878
(gentle upbeat music)

07:24.878 --> 07:25.679
* This town ain't big
enough for the both of us *

07:25.679 --> 07:26.914
(gentle upbeat music)

07:26.914 --> 07:30.584
* And it ain't me
who's gonna leave *

07:30.584 --> 07:33.821
(gentle upbeat music)

07:36.590 --> 07:38.692
* Daily, except for Sunday

07:38.692 --> 07:39.527
* You dawdle in to the cafÃ©
where you meet her each day *

07:39.527 --> 07:41.428
* Except for Sunday

07:41.428 --> 07:43.030
(gentle upbeat music)

07:43.030 --> 07:45.032
* Heartbeat,
increasing heartbeat *

07:45.032 --> 07:47.234
* As 20 cannibals
have hold of you *

07:47.234 --> 07:49.737
* They need their protein
just like you do *

07:49.737 --> 07:53.306
* This town ain't big
enough for the both of us *

07:53.306 --> 07:55.876
* And it ain't me
who's gonna leave *

07:55.876 --> 07:59.112
(gentle upbeat music)

08:08.055 --> 08:10.090
- [Radio Host] It's
another chilly Fall morning

08:10.090 --> 08:11.692
in Carverville.

08:11.692 --> 08:15.929
All your little demons
and ghosts out there
bundle up tight.

08:15.929 --> 08:18.932
Tonight expect SOME
boNE rattling shivers,

08:18.932 --> 08:21.101
maybe even a flurry or two.

08:21.101 --> 08:23.937
It's a no-brainer Where
I'll be on Halloween.

08:23.937 --> 08:27.274
Tomorrow is Len Carver's,
"Zombie Town" premier.

08:27.274 --> 08:29.076
- What the hell you
doing, you moron?

08:29.076 --> 08:30.510
- [Radio Host] Can
you believe it?

08:30.510 --> 08:33.446
It's been almost 30 years
since his last film.

08:34.514 --> 08:37.117
In the meantime, we're
creeping it real,

08:37.117 --> 08:40.654
with a song dedicated to our
very own master of horror.

08:43.757 --> 08:44.658
- Die.

08:47.595 --> 08:48.428
Just me.

08:48.428 --> 08:51.531
(Andy laughing)

08:51.531 --> 08:53.266
Your faces.

08:53.266 --> 08:54.334
Should've seen your faces.

08:54.334 --> 08:55.769
You'd make yourself laugh.

08:58.005 --> 09:00.240
- Hey Andy, can I
use your bathroom?

09:00.240 --> 09:03.476
- Oh, Mike, you know I can't
let you use the bathroom

09:03.476 --> 09:05.178
unless you buy something.

09:05.178 --> 09:07.915
- But I don't have enough
money for your expensive bikes.

09:07.915 --> 09:09.950
Besides I already have one.

09:09.950 --> 09:11.785
- Buy something
cheap, a reflector,

09:11.785 --> 09:13.821
maybe a gum, I got a
gumball machine, no.

09:13.821 --> 09:16.657
Or maybe a sticker, one
of my Andy stickers.

09:16.657 --> 09:18.358
Maybe a little
basket, cheap basket.

09:18.358 --> 09:20.527
You know, carry your,
carry your school books.

09:20.527 --> 09:21.862
Maybe a holder for your phone.

09:21.862 --> 09:23.831
You don't wanna be
without tour phone.

09:23.831 --> 09:24.665
(car horn honking)

09:24.665 --> 09:25.699
Watch the car.

09:25.699 --> 09:26.667
(gentle upbeat music)

09:26.667 --> 09:27.935
* Let me tell you about

09:27.935 --> 09:31.705
* I can turn and
I like to twist *

09:31.705 --> 09:36.576
* But I love stomping
just like this *

09:36.576 --> 09:37.811
* Not much work

09:37.811 --> 09:39.980
* You just sort of relax

09:39.980 --> 09:44.584
* And listen to the gentleman
play that track, yeah *

09:44.584 --> 09:47.821
(gentle upbeat music)

10:01.935 --> 10:04.504
* Oh now yeah

10:06.907 --> 10:07.808
- Oh.

10:21.789 --> 10:23.924
(students screaming)

10:23.924 --> 10:26.059
(both laughing)

10:26.059 --> 10:28.428
- Oh my God, dude,
we got you so good.

10:29.196 --> 10:30.497
(both laughing)

10:30.497 --> 10:31.732
Pee stains and everything.

10:31.732 --> 10:32.966
(both laughing)

10:32.966 --> 10:34.534
- What's wrong with you?

10:34.534 --> 10:36.169
Seriously not funny guys.

10:36.169 --> 10:37.270
- What?

10:37.270 --> 10:38.706
Come on dude, it's Halloween.

10:38.706 --> 10:40.874
- Well, dude, you're
the mayor's son,

10:40.874 --> 10:42.876
you're supposed
to be more mature.

10:42.876 --> 10:44.044
- Like you?

10:44.044 --> 10:47.080
(both laughing)

10:47.080 --> 10:49.116
- Well, at least you
guys don't have to worry

10:49.116 --> 10:51.184
about real zombie apocalypse.

10:51.184 --> 10:52.352
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

10:52.352 --> 10:54.688
- 'Cause we kick ass.

10:54.688 --> 10:57.590
- No, 'cause zombies eat brains.

11:00.393 --> 11:01.161
Oh.

11:04.297 --> 11:06.399
- Are you saying
they we're stupid?

11:06.399 --> 11:07.300
- No.

11:08.635 --> 11:13.073
- 'Cause if you are, I
would watch myself, simp.

11:14.942 --> 11:18.311
(both laughing)

11:18.311 --> 11:20.447
- [Student] Put it on
like you did something.

11:20.447 --> 11:21.849
(both laughing)

11:21.849 --> 11:24.584
- Bro, he called
us stupid, like us.

11:25.652 --> 11:26.553
- I mean.

11:28.055 --> 11:30.858
(people speaking indistinctly)

11:30.858 --> 11:33.226
(locker door slamming)

11:33.226 --> 11:35.062
- Amy, Amy, Amy.

11:36.764 --> 11:38.966
You coming to my zombie
town party tonight?

11:40.333 --> 11:41.568
- Yeah.

11:41.568 --> 11:43.503
Maybe, if I'm not
loaded with homework.

11:45.638 --> 11:46.439
- Think it over.

11:47.340 --> 11:51.211
(people speaking indistinctly)

11:55.816 --> 11:56.917
(locker door slamming)

11:56.917 --> 11:58.151
- Hey.

11:58.151 --> 11:59.820
I just saw Chad and
the zombie crew.

11:59.820 --> 12:00.988
Coming to the party too?

12:00.988 --> 12:01.955
- What?

12:01.955 --> 12:03.456
Never.

12:03.456 --> 12:05.926
I wouldn't be caught dead
going to that stupid party.

12:05.926 --> 12:08.996
Wait, you're not
actually going, are you?

12:08.996 --> 12:11.832
- So, Chad invited you?

12:11.832 --> 12:13.133
Really?

12:13.133 --> 12:14.334
- Drop the act, honey.

12:14.334 --> 12:16.336
Everyone knows that
you're in love with him.

12:16.336 --> 12:18.505
- So, Amy, what's your
Halloween costume gonna be?

12:18.505 --> 12:19.539
A donation pile?

12:20.908 --> 12:23.710
- You know, I was thinking
that you should go

12:23.710 --> 12:26.613
as Medusa and her two sisters.

12:26.613 --> 12:28.916
One of you gorgons lose this?

12:28.916 --> 12:31.418
(Amy laughing)

12:31.418 --> 12:34.454
- Chad Newman, jockasaurus rex.

12:34.454 --> 12:36.790
At least you don't have
his phone number, right.

12:38.959 --> 12:39.993
Oh, no.

12:39.993 --> 12:41.161
Since when?

12:41.161 --> 12:41.995
- Sixth grade.

12:41.995 --> 12:43.096
Stop being jealous.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.297
- I'm not jealous.

12:44.297 --> 12:46.166
I just wouldn't want
a text from him.

12:46.166 --> 12:49.636
He's a stupid idiot.

12:49.636 --> 12:51.538
He's a, he's just stupid,

12:51.538 --> 12:53.941
he's over.
- We are so late for biology.

12:53.941 --> 12:58.912
- That's not all you're late
for, young Michael Broadstreet.

12:59.612 --> 13:00.680
- Mrs. Boneyard.

13:00.680 --> 13:02.015
- It's pronounced Bonnard.

13:03.016 --> 13:05.552
You have overdue
books, Mr. Broadstreet.

13:05.552 --> 13:07.420
- I'm super late for class.

13:07.420 --> 13:08.288
Bye.

13:10.123 --> 13:14.627
- Gee, I love your
costume, Mrs. Bonnard.

13:14.627 --> 13:17.931
What are you, a witch right?

13:17.931 --> 13:21.401
- Oh, it's not a costume,
I was sweeping the floor,

13:21.401 --> 13:22.469
sweep, sweep.

13:23.470 --> 13:25.572
Oh, you just couldn't
help yourself

13:25.572 --> 13:28.208
with making like a little
joke, could you, Michael?

13:28.208 --> 13:29.476
Okay, fine.

13:29.476 --> 13:31.178
One month detention.

13:31.178 --> 13:32.913
- Whoa, Mrs. Boneyard, Bonnard.

13:32.913 --> 13:35.615
- Excuse me, I have
to tell the principal

13:35.615 --> 13:37.650
about this little exchange.

13:37.650 --> 13:40.187
- I have to study and I
have an after school job.

13:40.187 --> 13:42.489
Mrs. Boneyard, please.

13:42.489 --> 13:43.390
Bonnard.

13:43.390 --> 13:44.357
Please.

13:44.357 --> 13:47.260

13:47.260 --> 13:49.262
- [Narrator] The
horror master is back.

13:54.367 --> 13:58.105
Len Carver brings you another
flesh dressed extravaganza.

13:58.105 --> 13:59.406
(victim screaming)

13:59.406 --> 14:02.109
The earth is plagued
by zombie cannibals,

14:02.109 --> 14:04.144
blood thirsty, sick and twisted.

14:04.144 --> 14:06.179
(victim screaming)

14:06.179 --> 14:08.681
This walking dead movie
will zombify your mind,

14:10.483 --> 14:13.120
paralyze your eyes, and
sabotage your senses.

14:13.120 --> 14:14.554
(dramatic music)

14:14.554 --> 14:17.190
You'll laugh, you'll cry,
you'll kiss five bucks goodbye.

14:17.190 --> 14:18.725
(zombies moaning)

14:18.725 --> 14:20.427
(victim screaming)

14:20.427 --> 14:21.661
(zombies moaning)

14:21.661 --> 14:23.830
- Ew, ew, ew, ew.

14:23.830 --> 14:26.166
- [Narrator] "Zombie
Sophomore Feast."

14:26.166 --> 14:28.135
(dramatic music)

14:28.135 --> 14:29.669
A Carver Production.

14:29.669 --> 14:33.140
(dramatic music)

14:33.140 --> 14:34.274
(birds chirping)

14:34.274 --> 14:35.642
- Hey guys, it's Deano the Carv,

14:35.642 --> 14:38.378
the biggest Carver
fan club in the world.

14:38.378 --> 14:39.846
We're sitting outside
Carver's house

14:39.846 --> 14:41.114
and we caught a rumor,

14:41.114 --> 14:42.015
he's planning to drop
off the movie tonight

14:42.015 --> 14:43.416
at Landro's Theater.

14:43.416 --> 14:44.351
We will be there.

14:44.351 --> 14:45.852
- God.
- We will cut.

14:46.686 --> 14:49.489
(dramatic music)

15:29.362 --> 15:32.832
- Miss. Bonnard,
can I please go now?

15:32.832 --> 15:35.835
- I presume you and
your little friends

15:35.835 --> 15:38.738
all wanna see that depraved
movie tomorrow night.

15:40.840 --> 15:41.741
- Carver?

15:43.143 --> 15:44.611
I hate his movies.

15:44.611 --> 15:48.448
(gentle upbeat music)

15:48.448 --> 15:49.349
- You do?

15:50.717 --> 15:52.952
- Oh God, with a passion.

15:56.123 --> 15:57.490
- You're free to go.

15:57.490 --> 15:58.625
(gentle upbeat music)

15:58.625 --> 15:59.859
- Really?

15:59.859 --> 16:02.429
- I said go, before
I changed my mind.

16:03.530 --> 16:04.597
- Thank you so much.

16:05.565 --> 16:07.967
(gentle upbeat music)

16:07.967 --> 16:10.870
- Besides, maybe I can still
catch, "Mr. Really Right 2."

16:16.109 --> 16:18.945
(dramatic music)

16:53.380 --> 16:55.382
- [Mike] Oh, no, not these guys.

16:56.516 --> 16:59.652
- Hey, Mike, you got a
let us in early, man.

16:59.652 --> 17:01.388
- The premiere's tomorrow okay.

17:01.388 --> 17:03.123
We're showing a
romantic comedy tonight.

17:03.123 --> 17:05.625
If you don't buy a ticket for
that, you can't get in, cool.

17:05.625 --> 17:07.194
- Dude, "Mr. Really Right 2."

17:07.194 --> 17:09.362
Come on, you're not gonna
make any money off of that.

17:09.362 --> 17:10.363
Let us in.

17:11.264 --> 17:12.632
Do you have the prints already?

17:12.632 --> 17:13.900
Has Carver been by?

17:13.900 --> 17:17.070
Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike,
you know why we're here.

17:17.070 --> 17:19.672
Collectively, we are the Carved.

17:19.672 --> 17:20.507
The most.

17:20.507 --> 17:21.341
- Dedicated.

17:21.341 --> 17:22.275
- Hardcore.

17:22.275 --> 17:23.710
- Len Carver fans on the planet.

17:23.710 --> 17:25.445
And we are here to see,
"Zombie Town" and pay respect

17:25.445 --> 17:27.614
to our eternal master
of the walking dead.

17:27.614 --> 17:28.548
(hands smacking)

17:28.548 --> 17:29.449
- Amen.

17:31.118 --> 17:32.018
- Wow.

17:33.386 --> 17:36.089
Dean, just, just
come back tomorrow.

17:36.089 --> 17:37.757
- Oh, Mikey.

17:37.757 --> 17:41.761
Mikey, come on, maybe we
can work some arrangement.

17:41.761 --> 17:43.630
How about I mention
your name on my Insta?

17:43.630 --> 17:45.298
It'll get you girls.

17:45.298 --> 17:46.966
Maybe Amy will even like you.

17:47.934 --> 17:49.502
- Amy and I are just friends.

17:50.970 --> 17:52.939
- Yeah, sure.

17:52.939 --> 17:55.608
(all laughing)

17:59.312 --> 18:02.582
You'll rue the day, theater cog.

18:02.582 --> 18:05.252
(gentle music)

18:22.369 --> 18:23.536
- This whole town

18:23.536 --> 18:26.005
is just a bunch of
zombie following idiots.

18:33.946 --> 18:37.850
- The time has come for
you to face your fears,

18:37.850 --> 18:39.519
Michael Broadstreet.

18:41.588 --> 18:43.022
- Mr. Landro.

18:45.992 --> 18:48.628
- It's more of a vampire
thing and a zombie thing.

18:48.628 --> 18:51.130
But I mean, if I
went full on zombie,

18:51.130 --> 18:52.732
I wouldn't be able to speak.

18:52.732 --> 18:53.833
So there's that.

18:58.505 --> 19:01.508
Mike, smile.

19:04.143 --> 19:07.247
- Can we just please work, sir?

19:08.080 --> 19:09.849
- It's a good idea.

19:09.849 --> 19:10.850
Come with me.

19:12.419 --> 19:13.920
Okay.

19:13.920 --> 19:17.924
So you and the, and the others
will arrive half hour early,

19:19.359 --> 19:23.763
you'll put on your zombie
masks and costumes, okay.

19:23.763 --> 19:24.597
Hold that for me.

19:24.597 --> 19:25.532
And, oh, oh.

19:27.500 --> 19:28.901
I gotta show you something.

19:35.375 --> 19:37.977
(Landro laughing)

19:37.977 --> 19:42.715
So who do you think built
that remote controlled zombie?

19:46.052 --> 19:48.821
Why don't you put that
down, gimme a hand?

19:48.821 --> 19:52.225
So I can use him
for zombie movies,

19:52.225 --> 19:55.528
or I can use him
for vampire movies.

19:57.129 --> 20:01.568
And tomorrow night I'm gonna
spring him on the Carved.

20:02.369 --> 20:03.903
(both laughing)

20:03.903 --> 20:08.841
So Mike, Mike, I know you
don't love horror movies,

20:09.942 --> 20:13.713
you know, but a
lot of people do.

20:13.713 --> 20:17.784
So if, if you watch them
for what they truly are,

20:17.784 --> 20:21.120
I mean, not just, you
know, zombie movies,

20:22.989 --> 20:27.560
you might, you might
just see something

20:27.560 --> 20:29.729
that you love about them, huh.

20:31.063 --> 20:33.700
(gentle music)

20:34.634 --> 20:36.168
(car engines revving)

20:36.168 --> 20:39.038
(thunder rumbling)

20:39.038 --> 20:41.774
(dramatic music)

20:50.149 --> 20:51.451
Oh my God.

20:51.451 --> 20:54.354
- Oh my God.

20:54.354 --> 20:57.089
(dramatic music)

20:58.157 --> 20:58.958
- Oh.

21:04.731 --> 21:06.165
Let him in.

21:06.165 --> 21:08.968
(dramatic music)

21:20.313 --> 21:21.213
Len.

21:22.749 --> 21:23.650
OMG.

21:24.917 --> 21:26.085
Oh it's been,

21:27.654 --> 21:29.756
I mean, it's been,
it's been a few years.

21:31.524 --> 21:35.728
Is that the masterpiece
under your arm?

21:37.764 --> 21:39.532
- Pleased to meet
you, Mr. Carver.

21:43.870 --> 21:45.405
- Is the projector ready?

21:45.405 --> 21:48.975
(thunder rumbling)

21:48.975 --> 21:53.380
- Well she's old and
she's a little rusty.

21:53.380 --> 21:58.050
But Mike here, YouTubed how
to thread her and run her

21:58.050 --> 21:59.986
and we're gonna be ready, ready

21:59.986 --> 22:01.253
for tomorrow night's premiere.

22:01.253 --> 22:02.822
No problem, right, Mike?

22:02.822 --> 22:04.023
- Yeah, no problem.

22:04.023 --> 22:04.924
- There you go.

22:06.125 --> 22:08.761
(Landro laughing)

22:08.761 --> 22:12.765
Do you, do you remember
this issue of Monster Mag,

22:12.765 --> 22:15.234
Mrs. Grammarly gave us
a detention just for.

22:15.234 --> 22:17.537
- Richard, are you sure

22:17.537 --> 22:18.971
there are enough
seats in the theater?

22:18.971 --> 22:21.073
It's important that
everyone in town be here.

22:21.073 --> 22:23.242
- Sure, sure, Len, yeah.

22:23.242 --> 22:26.646
Theater seats 666.

22:26.646 --> 22:29.215
Sounds like a joke, but
it's technically correct.

22:31.818 --> 22:33.386
- [Mezmerian] Destroy
your films Len.

22:33.386 --> 22:34.821
Destroy your films.

22:36.188 --> 22:38.825
(dramatic music)

22:38.825 --> 22:39.726
- Oh.

22:41.027 --> 22:43.329
- Mr. Carver, are you okay?

22:44.964 --> 22:46.298
- Oh.

22:46.298 --> 22:49.135
(dramatic music)

22:56.476 --> 22:58.778
One step to can, I
can't push through.

22:58.778 --> 22:59.846
- It happens every time.

22:59.846 --> 23:00.980
Come on sit.
- No.

23:00.980 --> 23:02.449
- Just sit down and relax.
- No.

23:02.449 --> 23:03.650
I won't be playing the film.

23:03.650 --> 23:04.751
- Let's get that.

23:04.751 --> 23:05.985
That's very heavy.

23:05.985 --> 23:07.487
Put that on the counter.

23:07.487 --> 23:08.721
Get me a glass of water, quick.

23:08.721 --> 23:13.392
- I won't, I won't do
it. (dramatic music)

23:21.568 --> 23:22.635
- Oh my God.

23:27.206 --> 23:28.107
Len.

23:33.513 --> 23:34.413
Len.

23:37.083 --> 23:37.984
Len.

23:46.258 --> 23:48.227
- Don't play the movie.

23:52.665 --> 23:54.501
Don't play the movie.

23:55.401 --> 23:58.871
- It's okay Len, call 911.

23:58.871 --> 24:00.072
Call 911.

24:00.072 --> 24:02.909
(police sirens blaring)

24:02.909 --> 24:05.478
- Everybody stay
back, stay back.

24:05.478 --> 24:09.482
- No, no, the master
of the flesh walkers,

24:09.482 --> 24:11.350
fallen, the master has fallen.

24:11.350 --> 24:13.419
- Dean, you gotta
get yourself home.

24:13.419 --> 24:14.821
Mom's got dinner on the table.

24:14.821 --> 24:16.489
So you go home, get.

24:16.489 --> 24:19.291
Crane, Dimp, same thing,
you guys get outta here.

24:19.291 --> 24:21.393
- He's gonna rise again,
he's gonna rise again.

24:21.393 --> 24:24.263
(people speaking indistinctly)

24:24.263 --> 24:27.500
(gentle upbeat music)

24:33.673 --> 24:37.510
- Is that dear old Mr.
Patterson on the stretcher?

24:38.444 --> 24:41.514
- No, it's just some random guy.

24:43.750 --> 24:47.720
Enjoy, "Mr. Really Right 2"
Ms. Bonnard, Bonnard, right.

24:49.689 --> 24:51.323
- You need to make an arrest.

24:51.323 --> 24:52.725
We're dealing with
the real crisis here.

24:52.725 --> 24:55.294
- You need to get gone, boy.

24:55.294 --> 24:57.530
Or you want a repeat of
what happened last week.

24:57.530 --> 24:58.464
- No.

24:58.464 --> 24:59.666
Carver, we're gonna save you,

24:59.666 --> 25:02.501
we're gonna save
you, Carver, Carver.

25:03.502 --> 25:04.403
Carver.

25:05.437 --> 25:07.006
- Okay, hide that.

25:09.075 --> 25:12.845
I'm gonna tell Mr. Carver
that he suffered a stroke,

25:12.845 --> 25:15.381
a stroke of genius.

25:15.381 --> 25:16.583
And he'll believe me,

25:16.583 --> 25:18.751
if I tell him when he's
still, still woozy.

25:20.186 --> 25:22.421
If you need me, I'll
be at the hospital.

25:23.556 --> 25:26.559
How, how many do we have
in the theater tonight?

25:27.459 --> 25:28.661
- One.

25:28.661 --> 25:29.996
- 100?

25:30.830 --> 25:32.431
- [Mike] No one.

25:33.432 --> 25:35.702
(gentle upbeat music)

25:35.702 --> 25:36.936
- Mrs. Bonnard?

25:36.936 --> 25:38.337
- Yeah, Ms. Bonnard, yeah.

25:39.171 --> 25:41.908
- [Actress] Look, I don't think

25:41.908 --> 25:43.776
we should see each
other anymore.

25:45.144 --> 25:48.247
- [Actor] I know you've
been cheating on me.

25:48.247 --> 25:52.018
- [Actress] You
know about Frank.

25:52.018 --> 25:53.986
- [Actor] Frank?

25:53.986 --> 25:55.554
I thought you were with Mark.

25:55.554 --> 25:56.555
- Oh.
- All right.

25:56.555 --> 25:58.791
All right I'll come clean.

25:59.626 --> 26:01.193
- [Actor] Yeah.

26:01.193 --> 26:03.329
(crying)

26:04.463 --> 26:09.201
- [Actress] I'm pregnant
with both your children.

26:09.201 --> 26:10.102
- No.

26:15.541 --> 26:17.376
- [Actor] What is it.

26:22.481 --> 26:26.953
* Making love with you

26:26.953 --> 26:32.024
* Has left me peaceful,
warm, and tired *

26:33.893 --> 26:38.831
* What more could I ask

26:38.831 --> 26:43.903
* There's nothing
left to be desired *

26:45.271 --> 26:50.276
* Peace came upon me
and it leaves me weak *

26:56.783 --> 27:01.520
* So sleep, silent angel

27:01.520 --> 27:04.390
* Go to sleep

27:04.390 --> 27:08.160
(gentle upbeat music)

27:08.160 --> 27:13.232
* Sometimes, all I need is
the air that I breathe *

27:15.702 --> 27:18.671
* And to love you

27:18.671 --> 27:21.473
(gentle upbeat music)

27:21.473 --> 27:22.308
- Amy.

27:22.308 --> 27:23.142
- Amy.

27:23.142 --> 27:23.976
- Stop.

27:23.976 --> 27:24.811
- Stop.

27:24.811 --> 27:25.978
- Stop.

27:25.978 --> 27:26.779
- Where do you
think you're going?

27:26.779 --> 27:27.446
- You can't go in there.

27:27.446 --> 27:28.480
Mike's in there.

27:28.480 --> 27:29.581
The executioner.

27:29.581 --> 27:31.517
- Yeah, he's the.

27:31.517 --> 27:32.852
- Amy, Amy, Mike Broadstreet
murdered Len Carver tonight.

27:32.852 --> 27:35.154
Don't go in there, he
can't be trusted, Amy.

27:35.154 --> 27:36.188
- Come on, come on.

27:36.188 --> 27:37.790
- Let me see it, let me see it.

27:41.260 --> 27:42.762
- Oh.

27:42.762 --> 27:46.265
Oh my God, they don't make
them like that anymore.

27:47.366 --> 27:50.336
Mike, you need to
tell Mr. Landro

27:51.437 --> 27:55.842
that it is movies like
that, that Carver filth,

27:55.842 --> 27:57.910
that keeps me from
coming to his theater.

27:57.910 --> 27:59.278
- I think we're the
only two in this town

27:59.278 --> 28:00.312
that feel that way.

28:01.347 --> 28:03.082
- You're right, Mr. Broadstreet.

28:04.583 --> 28:07.153
We're the last two sane
people in Carverville.

28:09.688 --> 28:10.790
(both laughing)

28:10.790 --> 28:12.391
I'll see you in detention.

28:13.826 --> 28:15.327
- Thank you.

28:15.327 --> 28:16.662
I won't forget.

28:16.662 --> 28:17.864
Have a good night.

28:20.132 --> 28:22.935
(dramatic music)

28:26.272 --> 28:28.440
Oh, gimme your phone,
I'll take a picture.

28:30.476 --> 28:33.312
(dramatic music)

28:38.284 --> 28:39.485
- Cool.

28:39.485 --> 28:41.353
Okay, so when do we watch it?

28:42.121 --> 28:43.022
- Tomorrow.

28:43.890 --> 28:45.825
- Dude, what are
you doing to me?

28:45.825 --> 28:47.093
- I'm not kidding.

28:47.093 --> 28:49.028
I'm dead if I show
that stupid thing.

28:49.028 --> 28:52.331
- So you are telling me
that I dragged my butt

28:52.331 --> 28:54.566
all the way down here
to take a picture

28:54.566 --> 28:56.635
with a movie canister?

28:59.105 --> 29:00.006
- Yeah.

29:02.674 --> 29:03.575
- Okay.

29:04.911 --> 29:06.712
- Hey, where are you going?

29:06.712 --> 29:09.982
- Oh, you know, I have to
get ready for Chad's party.

29:09.982 --> 29:11.851
A lot of football seniors
are gonna be there,

29:11.851 --> 29:14.653
and maybe I'll even
make out with Chad.

29:15.855 --> 29:17.656
Night is young and so am I, so.

29:18.490 --> 29:21.160
- Fine, fine.

29:22.161 --> 29:23.896
I'll thread the movie.

29:23.896 --> 29:26.565
(upbeat music)

29:30.602 --> 29:32.571
* It's the middle
of the weekend *

29:32.571 --> 29:34.340
* Hanging with my best friend

29:34.340 --> 29:36.408
* All on a Saturday night

29:36.408 --> 29:37.376
(gentle upbeat music)

29:37.376 --> 29:39.311
* The band is gone electric

29:39.311 --> 29:41.047
* The dancers are eclectic

29:41.047 --> 29:44.416
* Everything feels all right

29:44.416 --> 29:47.887
* Singing along to
my favorite songs *

29:47.887 --> 29:51.157
* Swaying to the beat

29:51.157 --> 29:54.393
* Laughing and joking
about the good old days *

29:54.393 --> 29:57.229
* All I keep thinking
is lucky me *

29:57.229 --> 29:58.130
- Thanks.

30:00.099 --> 30:01.000
- Okay.

30:01.934 --> 30:03.535
Do you need anything else?

30:03.535 --> 30:04.436
- No.

30:05.337 --> 30:07.073
Start the movie.

30:07.073 --> 30:08.007
- All right.

30:09.208 --> 30:12.044
(dramatic music)

30:27.960 --> 30:29.862
- No fricking way.

30:31.830 --> 30:34.033
- But Amy, I, I, I didn't.

30:34.033 --> 30:35.067
- Dude, shut up.

30:37.036 --> 30:39.605
This must be like an
alternate cut or something.

30:40.806 --> 30:42.241
This is history, dude.

30:43.775 --> 30:46.512
(dramatic music)

30:49.115 --> 30:50.716
What is this?

30:50.716 --> 30:52.351
Are you sure you're
playing the right film?

30:53.519 --> 30:56.355
- Ah, yeah.

30:56.355 --> 30:58.657
I mean, I, I think so.

30:58.657 --> 31:01.360
Are you sure this isn't
just part of the movie?

31:01.360 --> 31:02.628
- I've never seen a Carver film

31:02.628 --> 31:04.463
start with just a blank screen.

31:04.463 --> 31:07.299
(dramatic music)

31:13.272 --> 31:14.673
Mike, go up there and
see what the problem is.

31:14.673 --> 31:16.142
This is not the right movie.

31:16.142 --> 31:17.343
- It can't be.

31:17.343 --> 31:18.610
It's the only movie
Carver gave us.

31:18.610 --> 31:21.413
(dramatic music)

31:25.985 --> 31:26.885
Do you hear that?

31:28.254 --> 31:30.957
- Yeah, it sounds like an
earthquake or something.

31:30.957 --> 31:33.759
(dramatic music)

31:55.047 --> 31:59.785
- Amy, grab me the film cap.

31:59.785 --> 32:01.320
- Mike, what did you do?

32:02.121 --> 32:04.957
(dramatic music)

32:10.929 --> 32:12.464
- Remember safety third?

32:12.464 --> 32:13.932
I'm just kidding,
it's always first.

32:13.932 --> 32:14.833
Goodnight.

32:17.036 --> 32:18.837
Hey, Marge, you there, over?

32:18.837 --> 32:21.640
- [Marge] I'm always
here, Jenkins, over.

32:21.640 --> 32:23.109
- Hey listen, you got any word

32:23.109 --> 32:26.145
on how Len Carver's doing
at the hospital, over?

32:26.145 --> 32:28.447
- [Marge] Channel CVRRP
has live coverage,

32:28.447 --> 32:30.316
but you know how things go.

32:30.316 --> 32:33.219
You never get the
truth from these guys.

32:33.219 --> 32:34.486
- You know, listen,
Marge, you know what?

32:34.486 --> 32:35.954
I'm gonna swing by that theater

32:35.954 --> 32:38.057
and see what my
stupid son's up to.

32:38.057 --> 32:38.890
Jenkins out.

32:38.890 --> 32:41.693
(dramatic music)

32:52.571 --> 32:53.772
Marge, did you see that?

32:56.175 --> 32:58.144
Marge, did you see a
bright white light?

33:00.446 --> 33:01.313
Marjorie?

33:03.482 --> 33:05.517
What the hell is
going on in this town?

33:07.019 --> 33:09.088
What the hell is
going on in this town?

33:10.422 --> 33:13.392
(insects chirping)

33:18.530 --> 33:20.666
- Mr. Landro's gonna kill me.

33:20.666 --> 33:22.434
- Oh man, what was that?

33:23.502 --> 33:25.003
- What is wrong
with this projector?

33:25.003 --> 33:27.506
- Carver's gonna kill you,
Landro's gonna kill you,

33:27.506 --> 33:29.441
the whole town is
gonna kill you.

33:29.441 --> 33:31.343
- You know you got
me into this, right.

33:31.343 --> 33:32.744
They're part to blame too.

33:32.744 --> 33:33.845
- You invited me here.

33:33.845 --> 33:35.781
I didn't invite myself, Mike.

33:35.781 --> 33:37.716
- You know Amy, maybe
you should have gone

33:37.716 --> 33:39.151
to Chad's stupid party.

33:40.986 --> 33:41.953
Geez.

33:45.691 --> 33:47.025
- I can't believe
Carver would stoop

33:47.025 --> 33:49.027
to making experimental films.

33:49.027 --> 33:50.196
- Is this the movie?

33:50.196 --> 33:51.163
The whole screen is white.

33:51.163 --> 33:52.164
There's nothing there.

33:52.164 --> 33:54.233
- Yeah, I really
love the acting.

33:55.767 --> 33:59.638
- Oh, it must the new 3D
hardware Landro just installed.

33:59.638 --> 34:01.107
- And you just blew it up.

34:01.107 --> 34:03.375
Yay, jackass.

34:03.375 --> 34:06.145
- Oh, that's why Carver had
to load the film himself.

34:06.145 --> 34:07.479
It was 3D.

34:08.480 --> 34:09.515
I'm going outside to make sure

34:09.515 --> 34:10.982
the rest of the building's okay.

34:10.982 --> 34:12.684
- But you need glasses for 3D.

34:12.684 --> 34:14.453
How do you explain
that explosion.

34:15.321 --> 34:18.124
(dramatic music)

34:20.592 --> 34:23.061
Hey, my phone
doesn't have service.

34:23.061 --> 34:24.062
What about yours?

34:24.830 --> 34:27.633
(dramatic music)

34:27.633 --> 34:28.534
- Same.

34:29.701 --> 34:31.103
- Wow.

34:31.103 --> 34:32.938
The night that Mikey
plunged Carverville

34:32.938 --> 34:36.975
back into the stone age and
gets put in jail for life.

34:36.975 --> 34:38.244
- Can I double ride you.

34:39.245 --> 34:40.446
- On that bike?

34:40.446 --> 34:41.380
I don't think so.

34:44.983 --> 34:46.385
You are so F'ed.

34:50.021 --> 34:50.922
- Damn.

34:52.258 --> 34:55.060
(dramatic music)

35:04.336 --> 35:06.104
(insects chirping)

35:06.104 --> 35:06.938
(dramatic music)

35:06.938 --> 35:08.174
Zombie apocalypse.

35:08.174 --> 35:10.309
- Or everybody just went home?

35:10.309 --> 35:12.178
- Nope, it's a
zombie apocalypse.

35:12.178 --> 35:14.480
- Wait, I think I see somebody.

35:16.047 --> 35:17.249
Look.

35:17.249 --> 35:19.451
- Is that Ms. Bonnard?

35:23.489 --> 35:24.723
- God, let's find
someone else please.

35:24.723 --> 35:26.792
- No, no, no, she can help us.

35:26.792 --> 35:28.860
Hey, hi, Ms. Bonnard.
- Boneyard.

35:28.860 --> 35:30.496
- Bonnard.

35:30.496 --> 35:32.931
Loving the zombie makeup.

35:32.931 --> 35:37.068
- Amy, how'd you put that
makeup on so quickly?

35:37.068 --> 35:39.838
- Okay, so Mike here decided
to screw this whole thing up.

35:39.838 --> 35:41.039
- What?

35:41.039 --> 35:42.841
It's your fault
just as it is mine.

35:42.841 --> 35:44.243
- We're really sorry.

35:44.243 --> 35:48.414
The projector and the theater
kinda exploded, kinda.

35:48.414 --> 35:50.182
- Blew all the power and
we wrecked a 3D tech rig

35:50.182 --> 35:52.518
I didn't know it was there.

35:56.455 --> 35:58.290
Cells are down.

35:58.290 --> 36:01.527
(dramatic music)

36:01.527 --> 36:04.530
(insects chirping)

36:05.631 --> 36:08.967
- Way to go, Mike, you
made her catatonic.

36:08.967 --> 36:12.838
(Ms. Bonnard growling)

36:12.838 --> 36:15.307
- No, there's something
wrong with her.

36:15.307 --> 36:17.609
- You mean there's
something wrong with it?

36:17.609 --> 36:20.612
- Amy, what are you
saying, that she's a zombie

36:20.612 --> 36:22.180
from a Carver movie?

36:22.180 --> 36:24.182
Geez just, call
911 or something.

36:24.182 --> 36:25.951
- Our phones don't
work, remember?

36:26.952 --> 36:29.788
(dramatic music)

36:32.458 --> 36:34.226
- Oh, look, it's Dean.

36:35.227 --> 36:36.194
I knew it.

36:36.194 --> 36:37.329
It's the night before Halloween.

36:37.329 --> 36:39.030
And this is all a joke.

36:39.030 --> 36:42.668
Maybe they can help us with
Mrs. Boneyard or Bonnard.

36:42.668 --> 36:44.236
Close enough.

36:44.236 --> 36:45.804
Hey Dean.

36:45.804 --> 36:48.574
- I don't think that
they want to help anyone.

36:48.574 --> 36:50.642
- Amy, for the last time,

36:50.642 --> 36:52.244
the zombies rise
from the dead okay.

36:52.244 --> 36:55.046
Dean and Mrs.
Bonnard are not dead.

36:55.046 --> 36:56.915
- Dispatch, are you there?

36:57.716 --> 36:59.618
Marge, why won't you answer?

36:59.618 --> 37:00.852
What's going on?

37:00.852 --> 37:02.488
I hope you're just
in the restroom.

37:02.488 --> 37:04.122
- I don't care if
it's a joke, Mike.

37:04.122 --> 37:05.724
We probably shouldn't
get closer to them.

37:05.724 --> 37:06.725
(dramatic music)

37:06.725 --> 37:09.628
- All right, Dean, very funny.

37:09.628 --> 37:10.896
Joke's over now.

37:12.564 --> 37:13.665
Ha, ha, ha.

37:13.665 --> 37:14.566
- Marge.

37:15.401 --> 37:17.269
This town is gone crazy.

37:17.269 --> 37:18.737
(police sirens blaring)

37:18.737 --> 37:21.740
- Oh, thank God.

37:22.541 --> 37:24.009
- Officer Jenkins.

37:24.009 --> 37:26.011
- Amy, Mike, have
you seen my kid?

37:26.011 --> 37:29.315
A lot of crazy stuff going
on in this town tonight.

37:29.315 --> 37:30.215
- Yeah.

37:31.417 --> 37:33.585
- Dean, what are you doing out?

37:33.585 --> 37:35.321
You should have been
home an hour ago.

37:35.321 --> 37:36.855
Your mom's gonna be
very upset with you.

37:36.855 --> 37:39.591
(Dean growling)

37:49.601 --> 37:50.502
- Holy hell.

37:51.269 --> 37:53.071
(dramatic music)

37:53.071 --> 37:55.574
(Amy screaming)

37:55.574 --> 37:58.377
(dramatic music)

38:12.290 --> 38:13.792
- I'm sorry.

38:13.792 --> 38:17.663
No, no, I'm sorry, I promise
I won't play the movie, I.

38:17.663 --> 38:20.466
(dramatic music)

38:26.505 --> 38:28.106
(zombies moaning)

38:28.106 --> 38:29.608
You two guys are zombies.

38:29.608 --> 38:32.511
(zombies moaning)

38:37.115 --> 38:38.417
Oh, that means.

38:42.721 --> 38:44.289
Oh Landro, oh God.

38:47.626 --> 38:49.294
Oh God, not you too, oh God.

38:50.228 --> 38:53.064
(dramatic music)

38:54.332 --> 38:55.233
Then wait,

38:56.267 --> 38:57.403
who played the movie?

38:58.804 --> 38:59.705
Can you drive?

39:07.779 --> 39:10.616
(dramatic music)

39:12.884 --> 39:15.053
- Mike they're zombies,
like real zombies.

39:16.287 --> 39:18.223
- No, no, no, impossible.

39:18.223 --> 39:19.591
That's totally impossible.

39:20.692 --> 39:22.127
- Maybe the whole
town's infected.

39:22.127 --> 39:24.696
- Damn it, there's
still no reception.

39:24.696 --> 39:25.997
- Yeah, me neither.

39:25.997 --> 39:28.800
(dramatic music)

39:30.502 --> 39:32.003
- Andy's bike shop,
he's got a landline.

39:32.003 --> 39:34.806
(dramatic music)

39:50.922 --> 39:51.823
Hurry up.

39:53.058 --> 39:55.427
(dramatic music)

39:55.427 --> 39:57.629
- Okay, this is way
harder than it looks.

39:57.629 --> 39:59.598
- Try calling 911 first.

39:59.598 --> 40:02.434
(dramatic music)

40:09.641 --> 40:11.309
- It's busy.

40:11.309 --> 40:12.243
I'm gonna call my mom.

40:12.243 --> 40:13.545
Do you know my phone number?

40:13.545 --> 40:15.547
- You don't know your
own phone number?

40:15.547 --> 40:16.582
- No, why would I?

40:19.150 --> 40:21.987
(dramatic music)

40:23.354 --> 40:24.255
- Okay.

40:40.939 --> 40:43.208
- Mom, please, please answer.

40:44.643 --> 40:47.112
Her shift ended an hour
ago, so she should be home.

40:49.247 --> 40:51.349
Mom, is that you?

40:51.349 --> 40:54.553
(mom moaning)

40:54.553 --> 40:56.087
Mom, thank God.

40:56.087 --> 40:58.323
Okay, we are in serious trouble.

40:58.323 --> 41:00.492
You need to come to Andy's
bike shop like right now.

41:00.492 --> 41:02.528
- But be careful,
don't stop for anyone.

41:03.829 --> 41:08.900
- [Mom] Come home, bring friend.

41:11.870 --> 41:13.371
- I think my mom is a zombie.

41:13.371 --> 41:14.840
- Don't be ridiculous.

41:14.840 --> 41:15.907
- [Mom] Amy.

41:18.644 --> 41:19.811
Bring friend.

41:25.116 --> 41:28.253
(dramatic music)

41:28.253 --> 41:30.722
- You right, she's dead.

41:30.722 --> 41:32.490
- Alive, not dead.

41:32.490 --> 41:33.592
There's a difference.

41:33.592 --> 41:35.060
(insects chirping)

41:35.060 --> 41:35.961
- Is there?

41:37.162 --> 41:39.998
(dramatic music)

41:52.110 --> 41:54.980
Hey, that's stealing.

41:54.980 --> 41:56.514
- I mean, who cares?

41:56.514 --> 41:57.916
It doesn't even matter.

41:57.916 --> 41:59.184
Everyone's a zombie.

41:59.184 --> 42:00.686
Probably the whole town.

42:00.686 --> 42:04.656
My mom, my dad, my
brother, maybe even my dog.

42:04.656 --> 42:06.291
It's over, Mike.

42:06.291 --> 42:07.425
- We don't know that.

42:08.760 --> 42:10.729
We can try and figure out
what's going on, okay.

42:12.063 --> 42:15.601
I'm sure there's a reasonable
and practical explanation

42:15.601 --> 42:16.501
for all of this.

42:21.607 --> 42:25.443
Oh, this XV11 is sweet.

42:26.211 --> 42:27.245
- Well, take it.

42:28.847 --> 42:30.716
- I'm not stealing anything.

42:30.716 --> 42:34.219
- We are the last
people on earth, Mike.

42:34.219 --> 42:38.023
No rules, no laws, no
parents, no teachers.

42:38.023 --> 42:41.526
- What was that explosion that
came outta Carver's movie?

42:41.526 --> 42:44.362
(dramatic music)

42:46.197 --> 42:48.566
I should have never
played that movie for you.

42:48.566 --> 42:53.271
- Hey, Mike, before we
turn into one of them,

42:54.740 --> 42:57.308
I just wanted to say that I
think it's both of our faults

42:57.308 --> 42:59.077
for everything that's happened.

42:59.077 --> 43:00.979
So don't put it all on yourself.

43:02.013 --> 43:04.382
And I know how
hard it was for you

43:04.382 --> 43:07.953
to play that zombie
movie, and I get it,

43:07.953 --> 43:09.220
but it was really sweet.

43:09.220 --> 43:11.589
- I'm not that afraid
of zombie movies okay.

43:11.589 --> 43:12.590
- Oh, be real.

43:13.992 --> 43:15.160
- Shut up.

43:15.160 --> 43:16.094
- You're really
gonna have to tell me

43:16.094 --> 43:17.328
what happened to you as a kid,

43:17.328 --> 43:19.665
because this situation
does not accept wusses.

43:19.665 --> 43:21.032
- I don't have to
tell you anything.

43:21.032 --> 43:22.901
- You have to get over
your fear of zombies.

43:22.901 --> 43:24.903
It's just us and them now.

43:24.903 --> 43:27.873
And since I'm the
queen of Carver movies

43:27.873 --> 43:29.908
and you're just a wuss engineer,

43:29.908 --> 43:31.677
I think that I
should take charge.

43:32.944 --> 43:34.179
- Disagree.

43:34.179 --> 43:36.147
- Perfect, so you
can take dictation?

43:38.216 --> 43:42.821
- Yeah, okay, let's
break it down.

43:45.190 --> 43:50.261
Why don't they eat flesh
or brains or whatever?

43:51.529 --> 43:54.332
- Well, you know
Dean's dad, the cop,

43:55.166 --> 43:58.904
that was a soul suck.

43:58.904 --> 44:00.806
- You think my mom is okay?

44:00.806 --> 44:03.641
(dramatic music)

44:05.944 --> 44:08.980
Then we go to the edge of
town and get some help.

44:08.980 --> 44:10.782
- Yeah, makes sense.

44:10.782 --> 44:12.617
- I need the washroom.

44:12.617 --> 44:15.253
Andy didn't let me
use it this morning

44:15.253 --> 44:17.455
and grab anything we need.

44:18.556 --> 44:20.425
Here's some money so
he can pay for it.

44:20.425 --> 44:21.793
- Are you for real?

44:21.793 --> 44:22.694
- Yes.

44:23.929 --> 44:25.931
I'll be right back.

44:25.931 --> 44:28.734
(dramatic music)

44:49.755 --> 44:51.156
(Mike screaming)

44:51.156 --> 44:52.423
(Andy growling)

44:52.423 --> 44:54.359
Amy, get over here.

44:54.359 --> 44:55.827
It's Andy.

44:55.827 --> 44:57.863
Grab something and hit
him on the head, anything.

44:57.863 --> 45:00.098
- But it's Andy,
I can't hurt him.

45:00.098 --> 45:01.432
- What about me?

45:04.502 --> 45:05.403
Hurry up.

45:07.705 --> 45:10.541
(dramatic music)

45:14.612 --> 45:16.247
- Oh.

45:16.247 --> 45:17.148
Oh.

45:28.860 --> 45:31.329
- I can't believe you
made me tie him up myself.

45:31.329 --> 45:34.800
- I'm not getting
anywhere near him, okay.

45:34.800 --> 45:37.969
(Andy growling)

45:37.969 --> 45:40.171
(dramatic music)

45:40.171 --> 45:42.774
- Oh my God, what is he doing?

45:42.774 --> 45:44.575
- He's calling to them.

45:44.575 --> 45:46.244
Use the backdoor, come on.

45:46.244 --> 45:49.547
(Andy growling)

45:49.547 --> 45:52.383
(dramatic music)

45:59.858 --> 46:01.359
- There's our school,

46:01.359 --> 46:03.528
we're getting closer to
the edge of town, come on.

46:03.528 --> 46:04.762
Mike, you're going
wrong way you idiot?

46:04.762 --> 46:06.597
- I just need to take that pee,

46:06.597 --> 46:08.133
I've been holding it forever.

46:09.234 --> 46:10.501
- God, why can't you
just pee outside?

46:10.501 --> 46:13.038
- I hate pissing outside, okay.

46:13.038 --> 46:15.841
(dramatic music)

46:22.914 --> 46:23.982
Oh, finally.

46:25.350 --> 46:27.986
(upbeat music)

46:36.561 --> 46:38.329
(zombie growling)

46:38.329 --> 46:39.164
Whoa, wait.

46:39.164 --> 46:40.398
(upbeat music)

46:40.398 --> 46:41.232
Oh.

46:41.232 --> 46:43.201
(zombie growling)

46:43.201 --> 46:45.837
(upbeat music)

46:46.704 --> 46:48.974
* How can I do anything

46:48.974 --> 46:50.541
(upbeat music)

46:50.541 --> 46:52.110
(zombie growling)

46:52.110 --> 46:52.944
* Taking down

46:52.944 --> 46:54.512
(zombie growling)

46:54.512 --> 46:56.747
* She said that's that I
don't wanna chitter chat *

46:56.747 --> 46:58.884
* Turn into a little
bit of turning *

46:58.884 --> 47:00.118
(zombies growling)

47:00.118 --> 47:01.519
* Coming up

47:01.519 --> 47:04.755
* When you go you will need it

47:04.755 --> 47:06.992
* Until you get seated

47:06.992 --> 47:07.993
(upbeat music)

47:07.993 --> 47:08.826
(zombies growling)

47:08.826 --> 47:09.660
- [Amy] We're trapped.

47:09.660 --> 47:11.229
- [Mike] Might be.

47:13.865 --> 47:17.135
* Down in the pleasures sent
a help that are heaven sent *

47:17.135 --> 47:20.538
* Listen to the topic
and listen the lady *

47:20.538 --> 47:22.607
- Mike, we have to
switch the plan.

47:22.607 --> 47:23.508
- What?

47:28.779 --> 47:31.416
- I mean, we can't leave
town, we have to stay.

47:32.483 --> 47:34.085
- You gotta be
kidding me, right?

47:34.085 --> 47:36.654
- Carver, he's the one
who made all these movies,

47:36.654 --> 47:38.924
so he has to know what to do.

47:38.924 --> 47:39.891
- You're nuts.

47:39.891 --> 47:42.127
- I mean, it all makes sense.

47:42.127 --> 47:44.862
Carver always hired nobody's
for all of his films.

47:44.862 --> 47:47.598
B actors that nobody's
heard or seen from since.

47:48.666 --> 47:50.401
Mike, don't get chicken on me.

47:50.401 --> 47:53.804
- Listen, Carver's
in the hospital okay,

47:53.804 --> 47:55.907
so we'll never be
able to get to him.

47:55.907 --> 47:56.807
- You're afraid.

47:56.807 --> 47:57.976
Just admit it.

47:57.976 --> 47:59.644
- No, I'm not.

47:59.644 --> 48:00.578
- Yes you are.

48:00.578 --> 48:01.446
Just admit it.

48:09.587 --> 48:10.621
- You want the truth.

48:10.621 --> 48:11.889
- For God's sakes, yes,

48:11.889 --> 48:13.959
I've been waiting to
hear this for years.

48:16.194 --> 48:19.164
- I saw "Zombie Corpse"
when I was six okay.

48:21.332 --> 48:23.634
- I didn't see
that until I was 11

48:23.634 --> 48:25.570
and it scarred me for months.

48:29.407 --> 48:33.311
- One night my babysitter
brought the DVD over.

48:34.412 --> 48:36.414
She and her boyfriend
were watching it,

48:36.414 --> 48:40.418
and I heard it playing
through my room.

48:40.418 --> 48:43.921
So I snuck downstairs to
see what they were watching.

48:45.023 --> 48:47.025
- And your babysitter
didn't turn it off?

48:47.025 --> 48:49.260
- The babysitter didn't
know I was there,

48:49.260 --> 48:53.131
she was too busy making out
with her boyfriend or whatever.

48:53.131 --> 48:54.065
(Amy laughing)

48:54.065 --> 48:55.700
- And you didn't leave the room.

48:57.735 --> 49:02.740
- I just hadn't seen that type
of movie before, you know.

49:05.110 --> 49:09.914
I was just so shocked I
couldn't close my eyes

49:09.914 --> 49:12.383
or run away.

49:14.752 --> 49:19.757
I just sat there, hiding
behind the couch watching.

49:23.628 --> 49:26.264
(Amy laughing)

49:29.634 --> 49:32.303
See, this is why I didn't
wanna tell you, you're evil.

49:32.303 --> 49:34.005
- No, I'm not
laughing about that.

49:34.005 --> 49:37.175
I'm laughing about the fact
that you can't outside.

49:37.175 --> 49:39.910
(both laughing)

49:43.481 --> 49:46.884
- I never told anybody
that, like nobody.

49:46.884 --> 49:51.689
But I should have told
you about it years ago.

49:51.689 --> 49:53.591
- I don't know why
you never told me.

49:54.692 --> 49:56.227
You should have
trusted me, Mikey.

49:58.296 --> 50:00.965
(gentle music)

50:07.272 --> 50:08.173
- I should have.

50:10.108 --> 50:12.777
(gentle music)

50:26.624 --> 50:28.159
Bonnard again?

50:28.159 --> 50:30.128
- She really gets
around, doesn't she?

50:33.464 --> 50:35.400
- The 10 trillion.

50:35.400 --> 50:38.236
(dramatic music)

50:54.752 --> 50:55.786
- Attentions.

52:01.619 --> 52:03.754
Her and I are the
only ones in this town

52:03.754 --> 52:05.190
that don't like Carver movies.

52:05.190 --> 52:07.792
- Look, you need to
make up your mind.

52:07.792 --> 52:09.927
Are you coming with
me to Carver's or not?

52:09.927 --> 52:12.062
- I told you, Carver's
in the hospital.

52:12.062 --> 52:13.698
- Perfect, so we break into
his house and find clues.

52:13.698 --> 52:15.766
I am not running Mike.

52:15.766 --> 52:18.002
Not if I can save my mom
and dad and this whole town.

52:18.002 --> 52:20.805
(dramatic music)

52:25.109 --> 52:28.379
- This eye was on
the film canister.

52:31.516 --> 52:32.417
- So?

52:33.284 --> 52:36.454
(dramatic music)

52:36.454 --> 52:39.290
- It was the only
thing that protected us

52:39.290 --> 52:40.758
from that white light.

52:42.960 --> 52:45.796
(dramatic music)

52:46.864 --> 52:50.100
(car engines revving)

53:01.746 --> 53:04.749
- That's a stop sign,
you might want to.

53:06.116 --> 53:09.487
Richard drive the thing in
a straight line, would you?

53:11.822 --> 53:13.758
You know if all of you hadn't
pushed me for another movie,

53:13.758 --> 53:15.426
none of us would ever happened.

53:15.426 --> 53:16.961
Red light, red light, yeah.

53:16.961 --> 53:19.330
Oh forget it, we're
in an ambulance.

53:23.534 --> 53:25.002
- It's just like Carver's,
"Night at the Mausoleum."

53:25.002 --> 53:26.871
Mezmerian needs to
find a film canister,

53:26.871 --> 53:28.606
so he stops the dead from
rising from the grave.

53:28.606 --> 53:31.442
- In this movie, right, are
there two teenagers in it,

53:31.442 --> 53:33.444
one named Amy and
the other one Mike?

53:34.312 --> 53:35.246
- No.

53:35.246 --> 53:36.981
- Then we are not in a movie.

53:36.981 --> 53:39.149
(dramatic music)

53:39.149 --> 53:40.751
Now let's get this film cans.

53:40.751 --> 53:42.587
They could protect
us from zombies.

53:43.521 --> 53:46.324
(dramatic music)

54:01.272 --> 54:02.540
- Great.

54:02.540 --> 54:04.041
We missed the best
part of the movie.

54:05.976 --> 54:07.445
- Look, I think the film cans

54:07.445 --> 54:10.180
are where we left them,
at the end of the row.

54:11.582 --> 54:13.551
- Okay, how do we do this?

54:15.185 --> 54:16.721
- Follow me.

54:16.721 --> 54:19.557
(dramatic music)

54:21.025 --> 54:23.928
(zombies moaning)

54:27.264 --> 54:30.835
(dramatic music)

54:30.835 --> 54:34.439
(zombies moaning)

54:34.439 --> 54:37.274
(dramatic music)

54:40.010 --> 54:43.180
(zombies moaning)

54:43.180 --> 54:45.983
(dramatic music)

54:47.752 --> 54:51.055
(zombies moaning)

54:51.055 --> 54:53.958
(dramatic music)

55:04.735 --> 55:07.705
(zombies growling)

55:11.809 --> 55:12.710
Run.

55:15.346 --> 55:17.114
- Ha suckers.

55:17.114 --> 55:19.917
(dramatic music)

55:22.019 --> 55:24.855
Please, please, I hope the
keys are still in there.

55:24.855 --> 55:27.392
- I just got my driver's
license, so I can drive.

55:29.394 --> 55:32.597
Hold on tight baby, it's
gonna you one hell of a ride.

55:32.597 --> 55:33.498
- Seriously?

55:33.498 --> 55:37.301
(car engines revving)

55:37.301 --> 55:39.804
Oh, okay, so you can't drive.

55:41.205 --> 55:42.339
- I can do this.

55:42.339 --> 55:44.141
- Get out, let me drive.

55:44.141 --> 55:44.942
(zombie growling)

55:44.942 --> 55:46.143
(Amy screaming)

55:46.143 --> 55:46.977
Oh my God.

55:46.977 --> 55:49.914
(zombie growling)

55:49.914 --> 55:50.881
What are you doing?

55:50.881 --> 55:52.082
- Getting away from it.

55:52.082 --> 55:54.919
- That doesn't make
sense, it's in the car.

55:54.919 --> 55:55.753
Just stop.

55:55.753 --> 55:56.587
(car engines revving)

55:56.587 --> 55:57.422
(car brakes screeching)

55:57.422 --> 55:58.255
(gentle upbeat music)

55:58.255 --> 56:01.158
(insects chirping)

56:02.527 --> 56:03.461
- Let's go to the bike shop.

56:03.461 --> 56:05.162
- What, you have to pee again?

56:05.162 --> 56:05.996
(dramatic music)

56:05.996 --> 56:09.166
(film reel spinning)

56:10.100 --> 56:12.903
(dramatic music)

56:15.105 --> 56:18.743
(ambulance sirens blaring)

56:22.312 --> 56:25.416
- Look at them mindlessly
drawn to the screen

56:25.416 --> 56:26.383
in that theater.

56:27.485 --> 56:29.386
Madness.

56:29.386 --> 56:30.755
- Madness.

56:30.755 --> 56:33.524
(dramatic music)

56:33.524 --> 56:37.862
Mad.

56:37.862 --> 56:39.163
Crazy.

56:39.163 --> 56:40.364
- Yes it is, Landro.

56:41.499 --> 56:44.168
Look at you people,
you're all zombies.

56:45.369 --> 56:46.604
You hear me?

56:46.604 --> 56:48.205
Zombies each and
every one of you.

56:50.575 --> 56:52.342
Drive me to the mausoleum.

56:52.342 --> 56:53.243
- Okay.

56:57.482 --> 56:59.850
(ambulance engine revving)

56:59.850 --> 57:01.952
- I thought you said
we shouldn't steal.

57:02.720 --> 57:04.221
- If we get to carvers

57:04.221 --> 57:06.991
and figure out how to turn
everyone back to normal,

57:06.991 --> 57:08.225
then I think that's
payment enough

57:08.225 --> 57:10.427
for one of these
overpriced bikes.

57:10.427 --> 57:13.263
(dramatic music)

57:15.966 --> 57:18.068
(car engines revving)

57:18.068 --> 57:20.905
(dramatic music)

57:22.306 --> 57:26.110
(car engines revving)

57:26.110 --> 57:28.946
(dramatic music)

57:40.891 --> 57:43.460
(baby crying)

57:45.796 --> 57:48.633
(dramatic music)

58:01.612 --> 58:05.415
How are we gonna sneak
into this creep's house?

58:05.415 --> 58:07.084
- Mike, seriously?

58:07.084 --> 58:08.352
I know you don't
like his movies,

58:08.352 --> 58:10.387
but you don't have
to be so negative.

58:10.387 --> 58:12.489
- I'm not being negative.

58:12.489 --> 58:13.724
- Between Carver and Chad,

58:13.724 --> 58:16.093
I'm starting to think
that you're the problem.

58:16.093 --> 58:16.994
- Me?

58:17.995 --> 58:19.263
Me?

58:19.263 --> 58:21.265
This whole town is the
one with the problem.

58:22.366 --> 58:25.435
- Well, found a rock,
so I'll get us in there.

58:25.435 --> 58:28.205
- I mean, you are also obsessed
with these dumb movies.

58:28.205 --> 58:29.940
And look where we are now.

58:29.940 --> 58:33.343
A zombie obsessed town
turned into literal zombies.

58:41.051 --> 58:41.952
- Oh.

58:43.087 --> 58:44.488
- Landro, not you too.

58:46.423 --> 58:49.259
(Landro moaning)

58:56.033 --> 58:59.269
(gentle upbeat music)

59:09.947 --> 59:11.616
(Landro moaning)

59:11.616 --> 59:13.684
- Show them in, Richard.

59:14.551 --> 59:15.452
- Oh.

59:17.822 --> 59:21.058
(gentle upbeat music)

59:27.564 --> 59:31.401
- Sir, I work at
Landro's theater.

59:31.401 --> 59:33.503
We met earlier.

59:33.503 --> 59:35.239
- Yes, I know who you are.

59:35.239 --> 59:38.275
- And I also just wanted
to say that I'm a huge fan.

59:38.275 --> 59:40.444
That's the, "Night of
the Mausoleum" isn't it?

59:40.444 --> 59:42.680
- So you're a fan.

59:42.680 --> 59:44.381
- Yes, very much so.

59:47.084 --> 59:48.318
- Then you're a zombie.

59:51.856 --> 59:53.824
- No, I'm not.

59:53.824 --> 59:54.725
Look at me.

59:58.062 --> 01:00:02.366
- Mr. Carver, you're the
only one who can help us.

01:00:02.366 --> 01:00:05.602
I mean, we figured you'd
be the guy to come to.

01:00:06.637 --> 01:00:08.172
- Please help us, Mr. Carver.

01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:11.541
- Have a seat.

01:00:11.541 --> 01:00:13.043
Make yourselves comfortable.

01:00:15.713 --> 01:00:17.648
I've got quite a
story to tell you.

01:00:19.083 --> 01:00:21.886
(Landro moaning)

01:00:31.028 --> 01:00:34.865
It all began in 1974
when I met a man,

01:00:36.533 --> 01:00:39.403
a wealthy collector
of artifacts,

01:00:41.238 --> 01:00:46.210
who came into possession of
some lost film reels, untouched,

01:00:47.411 --> 01:00:48.612
created by Thomas
Edison himself.

01:00:49.479 --> 01:00:50.314
(dramatic music)

01:00:50.314 --> 01:00:51.315
- That's crazy.

01:00:51.315 --> 01:00:52.316
- That's what I said.

01:00:53.884 --> 01:00:57.955
Edison hid them away, he
knew they were magical.

01:01:00.324 --> 01:01:01.826
Mezmerian believed
that they were imbued

01:01:01.826 --> 01:01:03.060
with mystical elements

01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:05.996
found only in an old
Egyptian burial chamber.

01:01:07.732 --> 01:01:09.700
I was a young
filmmaker at the time,

01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:11.601
and he hired me to
examine the reels

01:01:11.601 --> 01:01:14.705
to study and record their power.

01:01:15.806 --> 01:01:18.909
And their power was
all encompassing.

01:01:18.909 --> 01:01:20.344
(dramatic music)

01:01:20.344 --> 01:01:22.379
A cinematic alternate reality

01:01:23.948 --> 01:01:27.752
conjured up by ancient
alchemists for purposes unknown.

01:01:29.086 --> 01:01:33.623
- But there's nothing on
those reels in the theater.

01:01:33.623 --> 01:01:34.992
It's just white.

01:01:34.992 --> 01:01:36.260
- Well, yes, you see,

01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:39.696
you don't actually have
to photograph anyone.

01:01:39.696 --> 01:01:41.932
You just roll the film
and it turns the actors

01:01:41.932 --> 01:01:43.100
into the living dead.

01:01:45.102 --> 01:01:46.937
And then you, when you're
finished rolling the film,

01:01:46.937 --> 01:01:48.806
you put it back in the canisters

01:01:48.806 --> 01:01:53.177
and it immortalizes their
souls on film forever.

01:01:55.813 --> 01:01:57.081
Mezmerian tried to stop me,

01:01:57.081 --> 01:01:58.783
but I used the power
of the film to trap him

01:01:58.783 --> 01:02:01.085
inside, "Night of
the Mausoleum."

01:02:01.085 --> 01:02:02.686
The film that's playing
in the theater now

01:02:02.686 --> 01:02:04.889
has the power to suck
the souls out of everyone

01:02:04.889 --> 01:02:06.356
in this vicinity.

01:02:06.356 --> 01:02:11.428
That's why I need the canisters
to stop the zombie pandemic,

01:02:12.229 --> 01:02:13.663
to trap them in the film.

01:02:14.999 --> 01:02:19.436
- So the movies, the zombies
that I grew up watching,

01:02:19.436 --> 01:02:20.437
they were real?

01:02:23.173 --> 01:02:24.274
And.

01:02:24.274 --> 01:02:25.709
- You didn't direct them?

01:02:25.709 --> 01:02:27.544
- No, I didn't have to.

01:02:27.544 --> 01:02:30.981
The film turned everyone I
hired into the living dead.

01:02:30.981 --> 01:02:34.484
When "Night of the Mausoleum"
came out, it was a big hit,

01:02:34.484 --> 01:02:37.021
not a critical hit,
but a money hit.

01:02:38.288 --> 01:02:40.490
And that's the name
of the game, isn't it?

01:02:40.490 --> 01:02:41.491
Get a money hit.

01:02:44.795 --> 01:02:48.732
I made that film and another,
and another, and another,

01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:53.603
and became so famous that they
renamed this town after me.

01:02:55.940 --> 01:02:57.174
- Why did you stop?

01:03:01.378 --> 01:03:02.346
- The memories,

01:03:04.048 --> 01:03:06.683
the memories of those
tortured souls haunted me.

01:03:08.252 --> 01:03:09.753
Their anguish cries lived on,

01:03:09.753 --> 01:03:13.123
in the voices and eyes of
the people in this town,

01:03:13.123 --> 01:03:16.226
the followers, the
devotees, the aficionados.

01:03:16.226 --> 01:03:20.297
This bloody damn town obsessed,

01:03:20.297 --> 01:03:22.599
never leaving me alone,
demanding interviews.

01:03:22.599 --> 01:03:23.600
I couldn't get away from it.

01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:25.735
Do you know what it does to,

01:03:25.735 --> 01:03:27.237
to have committed
the greatest of sins

01:03:27.237 --> 01:03:29.439
and then be rewarded for it,

01:03:29.439 --> 01:03:33.410
what that would do to
a director, a person.

01:03:34.744 --> 01:03:39.116
- So you wanted to turn
the town into zombies?

01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:42.286
- Yes, I did.

01:03:44.754 --> 01:03:49.226
But then the guilt stopped me
and I couldn't play the film.

01:03:54.764 --> 01:03:57.401
But you did.

01:03:58.903 --> 01:03:59.769
You did play it.

01:04:01.171 --> 01:04:03.507
And now we have a chance, if
you gimme the canister back,

01:04:03.507 --> 01:04:07.244
we can, maybe we
can't save this town,

01:04:07.244 --> 01:04:10.080
but we can try to
save the world.

01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:13.317
- So we can stop
them from spreading

01:04:13.317 --> 01:04:16.320
but we can't undo
what's already been done

01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:17.521
to my mom and dad.

01:04:18.722 --> 01:04:21.258
- Unfortunately, I
don't have that answer.

01:04:23.793 --> 01:04:26.964
And Mezmerian had all
the knowledge there,

01:04:26.964 --> 01:04:30.034
and I trapped him before I
could learn the dark secrets.

01:04:31.235 --> 01:04:33.503
If he were here,
he'd know what to do.

01:04:33.503 --> 01:04:35.072
But we can try.

01:04:35.906 --> 01:04:37.407
We can try.

01:04:37.407 --> 01:04:39.876
We, we may be able
to, to reverse it.

01:04:43.447 --> 01:04:45.015
- Zombies may want my soul,

01:04:46.416 --> 01:04:49.219
but at least none of them beat
me up in the school bathroom.

01:04:49.219 --> 01:04:50.487
- What, Chad?

01:04:50.487 --> 01:04:53.590
Really Mike, just
give him the can.

01:04:53.590 --> 01:04:56.260
- Having a little lover's
quarrel at a time like this.

01:04:56.260 --> 01:05:00.664
- Mike, just give Carver
the film canister.

01:05:00.664 --> 01:05:03.667
We're trying to save the
people we love right.

01:05:03.667 --> 01:05:05.002
- I never love this town.

01:05:06.770 --> 01:05:07.637
I always hated it.

01:05:07.637 --> 01:05:08.538
- Mike.

01:05:09.539 --> 01:05:11.275
- You're right, Carver.

01:05:11.275 --> 01:05:12.809
Maybe this is what they deserve.

01:05:12.809 --> 01:05:14.778
- Give me the canister.

01:05:16.113 --> 01:05:18.215
- Screw you and this town.

01:05:19.516 --> 01:05:22.352
- Landro, get your
damned employee.

01:05:22.352 --> 01:05:25.189
(Landro moaning)

01:05:26.456 --> 01:05:28.125
- I'm out here.

01:05:28.125 --> 01:05:31.428
(dramatic music)

01:05:31.428 --> 01:05:32.329
- Get him.

01:05:32.329 --> 01:05:35.632
(Landro moaning)

01:05:35.632 --> 01:05:37.201
- Now we don't have the
other half of the canister

01:05:37.201 --> 01:05:38.735
to stop the film.

01:05:38.735 --> 01:05:40.804
Don't you have any others
from your previous films?

01:05:40.804 --> 01:05:42.272
- I do.

01:05:42.272 --> 01:05:43.440
But they're all at the
mausoleum and the cemetery

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:44.741
and some politician
locked it up.

01:05:44.741 --> 01:05:46.343
- All of your films
are at the mausoleum?

01:05:46.343 --> 01:05:47.844
- Yeah.

01:05:47.844 --> 01:05:49.679
- Mayor locked that place
up after a ton of teens

01:05:49.679 --> 01:05:51.281
tried to break in.

01:05:51.281 --> 01:05:54.151
But I think I know
a way in, Chad.

01:05:54.151 --> 01:05:56.920
- Chad from your
teenage lover's quarrel?

01:05:56.920 --> 01:05:58.355
(zombies moaning)

01:05:58.355 --> 01:06:00.590
- Chad's dad is the
mayor, he'll have the key,

01:06:00.590 --> 01:06:02.626
he has every key in town.

01:06:02.626 --> 01:06:03.460
But.

01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:04.661
- But what?

01:06:04.661 --> 01:06:05.695
- But there's a
huge party going on.

01:06:05.695 --> 01:06:06.830
- So?

01:06:06.830 --> 01:06:08.498
- So it'll be
swarmed with zombies.

01:06:08.498 --> 01:06:09.733
- Yeah.

01:06:09.733 --> 01:06:11.668
- Believe me, I know
how to handle zombies.

01:06:11.668 --> 01:06:13.103
We're taking the ambulance.

01:06:13.103 --> 01:06:14.504
You guys stay here.

01:06:14.504 --> 01:06:16.573
And I'll drive this time
because you guys don't know how.

01:06:16.573 --> 01:06:19.209
(both moaning)

01:06:27.451 --> 01:06:28.918
- Drink.

01:06:28.918 --> 01:06:29.753
- Sure.

01:06:29.753 --> 01:06:31.088
- Oh.

01:06:31.088 --> 01:06:34.091
(insects chirping)

01:06:38.362 --> 01:06:41.198
(dramatic music)

01:07:37.454 --> 01:07:38.355
- Mom.

01:07:39.789 --> 01:07:42.592
(dramatic music)

01:08:13.590 --> 01:08:14.491
Mom.

01:08:16.593 --> 01:08:17.894
I didn't mean to do this.

01:08:19.163 --> 01:08:21.665
I only played the movie because
I wanted Amy to be happy

01:08:22.766 --> 01:08:24.934
so she'd hang out with
me instead of Chad.

01:08:28.372 --> 01:08:29.873
I'm so sorry Mom.

01:08:31.975 --> 01:08:33.343
I'm so sorry.

01:08:33.343 --> 01:08:35.245
(dramatic music)

01:08:35.245 --> 01:08:36.846
- This town is your home.

01:08:39.048 --> 01:08:41.285
You just need to
figure out what it is

01:08:41.285 --> 01:08:42.486
that you love about it.

01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:53.963
(zombie growling)

01:08:58.302 --> 01:08:59.836
- I love you, Mom.

01:08:59.836 --> 01:09:01.671
I know what I need to do now.

01:09:01.671 --> 01:09:04.040
I know what it is that
I love about this town.

01:09:06.276 --> 01:09:07.411
- Your lunch.

01:09:08.978 --> 01:09:11.581
(dramatic music)

01:09:11.581 --> 01:09:15.219
(ambulance engine revving)

01:09:23.227 --> 01:09:24.328
- Poor Mike.

01:09:25.161 --> 01:09:26.095
- What about him?

01:09:27.497 --> 01:09:28.998
- Nothing.

01:09:28.998 --> 01:09:32.068
Listen, there're going to be
a lot of zombies in there.

01:09:32.068 --> 01:09:34.037
I mean a lot.

01:09:34.037 --> 01:09:35.339
Chad is super
popular and this is

01:09:35.339 --> 01:09:37.541
the biggest party of the year.

01:09:37.541 --> 01:09:38.442
- All right.

01:09:39.743 --> 01:09:43.247
Well Amy, just keep
this can close to you.

01:09:43.247 --> 01:09:44.714
The eye of Ra is the only thing

01:09:44.714 --> 01:09:46.616
that will prevent those
bumbling, stumbling zombies

01:09:46.616 --> 01:09:48.184
from sucking out your soul.

01:09:48.184 --> 01:09:50.153
- Well, what about you?

01:09:50.153 --> 01:09:52.121
- Don't worry,
I'll be all right.

01:09:52.121 --> 01:09:53.323
- Okay, well, I'm not joking

01:09:53.323 --> 01:09:55.292
when I say there's a
lot of zombies in there.

01:09:55.292 --> 01:09:58.528
(gentle upbeat music)

01:10:06.670 --> 01:10:07.804
- Super popular.

01:10:09.138 --> 01:10:11.107
Doesn't look like this
guy Chad has many friends.

01:10:12.276 --> 01:10:14.244
- Oh, looks like it.

01:10:14.244 --> 01:10:18.482
He invited his little
sister, his little brother,

01:10:18.482 --> 01:10:20.884
his aunt and our math
teacher Ms. Simpson.

01:10:20.884 --> 01:10:22.118
- Just don't let your guard down

01:10:22.118 --> 01:10:24.321
when we're looking
for those keys.

01:10:24.321 --> 01:10:26.456
- But they'll know,
I can't do this.

01:10:27.757 --> 01:10:29.259
- I'll direct you.

01:10:29.259 --> 01:10:30.226
(gentle upbeat music)

01:10:30.226 --> 01:10:32.329
* And it's getting nearer

01:10:32.329 --> 01:10:35.565
(gentle upbeat music)

01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:39.469
* I hear them coming after me

01:10:39.469 --> 01:10:40.970
(gentle upbeat music)

01:10:40.970 --> 01:10:44.040
* Looking for
something good to eat *

01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:47.444
* There can be no doubt.

01:10:48.645 --> 01:10:51.481
- Let's split up,
find those keys.

01:10:51.481 --> 01:10:54.818
(zombies moaning)

01:10:54.818 --> 01:10:56.286
Walk on, sister.

01:10:56.286 --> 01:10:59.423
(gentle upbeat music)

01:11:01.458 --> 01:11:04.361
(zombie growling)

01:11:07.564 --> 01:11:08.965
- Chad, not you too.

01:11:11.801 --> 01:11:12.702
Oh.

01:11:16.272 --> 01:11:19.876
Chad, it's okay, it's just me.

01:11:19.876 --> 01:11:22.546
You don't have to be
afraid, I, I put it away.

01:11:22.546 --> 01:11:25.081
Listen, I really need the
keys to the mausoleum.

01:11:25.081 --> 01:11:27.216
Do you know where your
dad might have put them?

01:11:29.953 --> 01:11:32.356
Chad, listen, you're a
really cool guy and all,

01:11:32.356 --> 01:11:35.625
but you're not exactly my type.

01:11:35.625 --> 01:11:37.627
So about those keys.

01:11:39.028 --> 01:11:44.100
Oh yeah you guys are
definitely made for each other.

01:11:44.868 --> 01:11:46.970
(zombie growling)

01:11:46.970 --> 01:11:48.838
(gentle upbeat music)

01:11:48.838 --> 01:11:51.741
(insects chirping)

01:11:53.843 --> 01:11:56.780
(gentle upbeat music)

01:11:56.780 --> 01:11:58.582
Carver, where are you?

01:12:00.016 --> 01:12:01.751
Carver, where are you?

01:12:02.519 --> 01:12:04.488
Carver, I need help.

01:12:04.488 --> 01:12:07.724
(gentle upbeat music)

01:12:11.060 --> 01:12:12.662
Carver.

01:12:12.662 --> 01:12:13.930
- I have the key.

01:12:13.930 --> 01:12:16.199
- Okay, great, but
I still need help.

01:12:16.199 --> 01:12:18.067
- I'm gonna go and figure
out how to stop all this

01:12:18.067 --> 01:12:20.570
and then you'll go back to
normal and you'll be fine.

01:12:20.570 --> 01:12:22.105
- Wait, what?

01:12:22.105 --> 01:12:23.306
Wait.

01:12:23.306 --> 01:12:25.442
You're gonna let turn
into one of them.

01:12:25.442 --> 01:12:26.943
- It won't be long,
I'll figure it out.

01:12:26.943 --> 01:12:28.678
- You're ditching me?

01:12:28.678 --> 01:12:29.846
- I promise I'll be back.

01:12:29.846 --> 01:12:31.481
You're my fan girl.

01:12:31.481 --> 01:12:32.449
(gentle upbeat music)

01:12:32.449 --> 01:12:35.284
* If you need a zombie hideout

01:12:35.284 --> 01:12:38.522
(gentle upbeat music)

01:12:41.625 --> 01:12:45.328
- I'll never watch another
zombie movie again, I promise.

01:12:46.730 --> 01:12:48.465
Mike, what are you doing here?

01:12:48.465 --> 01:12:50.266
I thought you left town.

01:12:50.266 --> 01:12:51.701
- Get behind me.

01:12:51.701 --> 01:12:52.536
(gentle upbeat music)

01:12:52.536 --> 01:12:53.737
(zombie growling)

01:12:53.737 --> 01:12:54.671
Sorry, Chad.

01:12:56.005 --> 01:12:57.206
Just a little payback.

01:12:58.341 --> 01:12:59.509
You'll be fine.

01:12:59.509 --> 01:13:00.710
(gentle upbeat music)

01:13:00.710 --> 01:13:02.045
- [Amy] Come on.

01:13:02.045 --> 01:13:05.281
(gentle upbeat music)

01:13:13.222 --> 01:13:16.292
(insects chirping)

01:13:18.194 --> 01:13:19.963
- Are you okay?

01:13:19.963 --> 01:13:22.532
- I lost the canister, Mike.

01:13:22.532 --> 01:13:23.767
- Don't worry about it.

01:13:25.201 --> 01:13:26.102
It's fine.

01:13:26.970 --> 01:13:27.804
(gentle music)

01:13:27.804 --> 01:13:29.038
(insects chirping)

01:13:29.038 --> 01:13:30.807
Why wasn't Carver with you?

01:13:30.807 --> 01:13:32.375
- He left me.

01:13:32.375 --> 01:13:33.810
- Where'd he go?

01:13:33.810 --> 01:13:35.745
- To the mausoleum.

01:13:35.745 --> 01:13:38.414
(gentle music)

01:14:11.781 --> 01:14:13.049
- Is this the mausoleum?

01:14:13.049 --> 01:14:14.718
- Yeah, this is it.

01:14:14.718 --> 01:14:17.654
- Okay, just gimme a second.

01:14:17.654 --> 01:14:20.590
(dramatic music)

01:14:20.590 --> 01:14:22.559
- [Amy] Hey Mikey.

01:14:22.559 --> 01:14:23.459
- Huh?

01:14:23.459 --> 01:14:24.528
- It's open.

01:14:25.862 --> 01:14:27.631
And I think Carver's
been here too.

01:14:27.631 --> 01:14:28.598
(dramatic music)

01:14:28.598 --> 01:14:29.465
- Okay.

01:14:29.465 --> 01:14:32.268
(dramatic music)

01:14:48.217 --> 01:14:49.118
- Oh.

01:14:49.118 --> 01:14:50.019
Oh.

01:14:52.121 --> 01:14:53.022
- Carver.

01:14:55.091 --> 01:14:55.992
- My movies,

01:14:57.093 --> 01:14:59.062
he wants me to do
the impossible.

01:14:59.062 --> 01:15:00.196
- What are you talking about?

01:15:00.196 --> 01:15:01.197
What's going on?

01:15:01.197 --> 01:15:02.832
- My films are in that tomb.

01:15:04.367 --> 01:15:05.835
- All of them?

01:15:05.835 --> 01:15:08.137
- He wants me to destroy
them, I won't do it.

01:15:10.173 --> 01:15:11.575
- Who's telling you that?

01:15:11.575 --> 01:15:15.244
- Mezmerian, he's in the mirror.

01:15:15.244 --> 01:15:18.081
(dramatic music)

01:15:21.284 --> 01:15:22.852
Mezmerian, no, no.

01:15:24.788 --> 01:15:26.289
I told you I refuse.

01:15:26.289 --> 01:15:27.390
Go away.

01:15:27.390 --> 01:15:28.892
- They must be destroyed.

01:15:28.892 --> 01:15:31.895
It's the only way to stop
this cinematic reality loop

01:15:31.895 --> 01:15:33.462
that we've created.

01:15:34.664 --> 01:15:35.865
- But, but, but
these are my films.

01:15:35.865 --> 01:15:38.334
This is, this is my legacy.

01:15:38.334 --> 01:15:39.168
- [Mezmerian] Len.

01:15:39.168 --> 01:15:40.670
- Yes, boss?

01:15:40.670 --> 01:15:42.839
- Your films must be burned,
you have to destroy them all.

01:15:42.839 --> 01:15:45.408
It's the only way to
free all of the souls

01:15:45.408 --> 01:15:47.510
you've trapped for decades.

01:15:47.510 --> 01:15:50.580
- Burn my films.

01:15:50.580 --> 01:15:53.950
- My old friend, you
can save the town

01:15:53.950 --> 01:15:56.953
and free all of us to resume
our lives from the era

01:15:56.953 --> 01:15:58.387
in which we were trapped.

01:15:58.387 --> 01:15:59.222
Oh man.

01:15:59.222 --> 01:16:01.357
(dramatic music)

01:16:01.357 --> 01:16:02.458
- Oh, oh.

01:16:02.458 --> 01:16:06.796
Oh, oh.

01:16:06.796 --> 01:16:08.598
I did that to them.

01:16:08.598 --> 01:16:10.967
I did that to them.

01:16:10.967 --> 01:16:14.303
(dramatic music)

01:16:14.303 --> 01:16:17.807
All right, all right,
I'll, I'll do it.

01:16:19.175 --> 01:16:20.744
And end this punishing regret.

01:16:22.879 --> 01:16:24.247
- [Mezmerian] Free us all.

01:16:25.749 --> 01:16:27.416
For us all Len.

01:16:27.416 --> 01:16:29.318
- For the fans.

01:16:30.186 --> 01:16:31.921
- For our town.

01:16:38.327 --> 01:16:39.663
- Let's get this lid off.

01:16:39.663 --> 01:16:42.999
(dramatic music)

01:16:42.999 --> 01:16:44.868
(insects chirping)

01:16:44.868 --> 01:16:46.770
All right, go to the theater,

01:16:46.770 --> 01:16:49.205
stop the projector,
that's the last film,

01:16:49.205 --> 01:16:50.473
I'll take care of these.

01:16:51.941 --> 01:16:53.509
- Wow.

01:16:53.509 --> 01:16:56.913
Do you think I could take one
of these as a souvenir, maybe?

01:16:56.913 --> 01:16:58.447
- Amy, no.

01:16:59.949 --> 01:17:01.050
- Can your kids drive?

01:17:02.285 --> 01:17:04.654
- I may not have my
full license yet,

01:17:04.654 --> 01:17:05.989
but I can drive better than you.

01:17:05.989 --> 01:17:08.524
- Take the ambulance,
go, go, go.

01:17:08.524 --> 01:17:11.761
(gentle upbeat music)

01:17:18.134 --> 01:17:21.437

01:17:35.018 --> 01:17:37.120
(zombies moaning)

01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:39.889
(all applauding)

01:17:39.889 --> 01:17:43.559
(gentle upbeat music)

01:17:43.559 --> 01:17:46.395
- We can't stop the
projector, remember.

01:17:46.395 --> 01:17:48.765
- Yeah but, we can pull
the film right off.

01:17:48.765 --> 01:17:50.199
- Okay well, do it.

01:17:50.199 --> 01:17:53.002
(dramatic music)

01:18:00.409 --> 01:18:03.379
(zombies growling)

01:18:05.648 --> 01:18:08.451
(dramatic music)

01:18:11.187 --> 01:18:14.457
(zombies growling)

01:18:14.457 --> 01:18:17.293
(dramatic music)

01:18:19.328 --> 01:18:22.331
(zombies growling)

01:18:24.167 --> 01:18:27.003
(dramatic music)

01:18:34.643 --> 01:18:36.145
Quick, the gasoline.

01:18:36.145 --> 01:18:38.982
(dramatic music)

01:18:43.119 --> 01:18:46.522
(zombies growling)

01:18:46.522 --> 01:18:49.358
(dramatic music)

01:18:51.427 --> 01:18:54.097
(door banging)

01:18:55.999 --> 01:18:58.301
Mike, they're onto us.

01:18:58.301 --> 01:18:59.268
(dramatic music)

01:18:59.268 --> 01:19:02.571
- Amy, I want you to know,

01:19:04.774 --> 01:19:07.510
that no matter what
happens after we do this,

01:19:07.510 --> 01:19:10.079
that I love you.

01:19:12.048 --> 01:19:13.149
And I almost have.

01:19:16.285 --> 01:19:18.287
- I've been waiting
for you to say that.

01:19:18.287 --> 01:19:21.524
(gentle upbeat music)

01:19:25.761 --> 01:19:27.864
(door banging)

01:19:27.864 --> 01:19:31.100
(gentle upbeat music)

01:19:32.468 --> 01:19:34.871
(fire crackling)

01:19:34.871 --> 01:19:36.639
- [Mezmerian] You're doing
the right thing, Carver.

01:19:37.941 --> 01:19:39.542
We have to set things straight.

01:19:40.643 --> 01:19:44.413
(gentle upbeat music)

01:19:44.413 --> 01:19:46.515
(fire crackling)

01:19:46.515 --> 01:19:49.886
(zombies growling)

01:19:49.886 --> 01:19:52.688
(dramatic music)

01:19:52.688 --> 01:19:54.457
- See you on the
other side, Mike.

01:19:55.324 --> 01:19:56.826
- Ghostbusters.

01:19:56.826 --> 01:19:58.962
- I thought you said you
didn't like horror movies.

01:19:58.962 --> 01:20:01.630
(gentle music)

01:20:02.999 --> 01:20:05.434
- Actually, it's a comedy.

01:20:05.434 --> 01:20:08.104
(gentle music)

01:20:25.621 --> 01:20:27.223
- This town is your homes.

01:20:27.223 --> 01:20:29.225
You just need to
figure out what it is

01:20:29.225 --> 01:20:30.659
that you love about it.

01:20:35.131 --> 01:20:38.301
- I know how hard it was for
you to play that zombie movie

01:20:38.301 --> 01:20:40.769
and I get it, but
it was really sweet.

01:20:42.671 --> 01:20:47.643
- [Narrator] Zombie movies,
you might just see something

01:20:48.544 --> 01:20:49.312
that you love about them.

01:20:50.479 --> 01:20:53.049
(gentle music)

01:21:07.163 --> 01:21:10.499
(people speaking indistinctly)

01:21:10.499 --> 01:21:13.136
(gentle music)

01:21:21.911 --> 01:21:24.047
- What are we doing here?

01:21:26.082 --> 01:21:27.416
- Oh my God, ew.

01:21:27.416 --> 01:21:30.053
(gentle music)

01:21:32.288 --> 01:21:36.859
- Hey.

01:21:36.859 --> 01:21:38.827
I invited you to
my party, right?

01:21:40.296 --> 01:21:41.864
Was that having a party?

01:21:41.864 --> 01:21:43.366
- It's okay, Chad.

01:21:43.366 --> 01:21:45.134
The party really wouldn't
have been that great anyway.

01:21:45.134 --> 01:21:48.037
So me and Mike are
gonna go hang out.

01:21:48.037 --> 01:21:49.338
- What?

01:21:49.338 --> 01:21:51.474
What is he like your
boyfriend or something?

01:21:51.474 --> 01:21:52.408
- Yeah, he is.

01:21:54.510 --> 01:21:56.745
(gentle music)

01:21:56.745 --> 01:21:57.546
- Simp.

01:21:59.282 --> 01:22:01.784
(gentle music)

01:22:03.286 --> 01:22:07.256
(people speaking indistinctly)

01:22:08.224 --> 01:22:10.659
(gentle music)

01:22:10.659 --> 01:22:11.594
- Oh.

01:22:11.594 --> 01:22:14.263
(gentle music)

01:22:17.766 --> 01:22:18.601
- What?

01:22:18.601 --> 01:22:19.435
What?

01:22:19.435 --> 01:22:20.303
What's going on?

01:22:20.303 --> 01:22:21.504
What is this?

01:22:21.504 --> 01:22:23.339
Why am I tied up?

01:22:23.339 --> 01:22:24.840
It's not Friday.

01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:27.276
Somebody help me, help me, help.

01:22:33.049 --> 01:22:35.684
(gentle music)

01:22:41.257 --> 01:22:44.560
(birds chirping)

01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:47.230
(gentle music)

01:22:48.064 --> 01:22:50.966
(birds chirping)

01:22:50.966 --> 01:22:53.636
(gentle music)

01:23:00.709 --> 01:23:03.646
- You know, Mike, I'm
really not that sad

01:23:03.646 --> 01:23:06.549
that we won't be seeing any
more horror movies from Carver.

01:23:08.351 --> 01:23:09.652
- He did the right thing.

01:23:11.154 --> 01:23:12.655
So did we.

01:23:12.655 --> 01:23:14.123
(gentle music)

01:23:14.123 --> 01:23:17.593
- You know, Amy, that
wasn't a bad little movie.

01:23:18.594 --> 01:23:21.230
(gentle music)

01:24:18.954 --> 01:24:21.090
* Ain't it good

01:24:21.090 --> 01:24:22.858
* Ain't it right

01:24:22.858 --> 01:24:26.662
* That you are with
me here tonight *

01:24:26.662 --> 01:24:28.731
* Music playing

01:24:28.731 --> 01:24:31.033
* Our bodies swaying in time

01:24:31.033 --> 01:24:34.770
* In time, time, time

01:24:34.770 --> 01:24:38.507
* Touching you, so
warm and tender *

01:24:38.507 --> 01:24:42.378
* Lord I feel such
a sweet surrender *

01:24:42.378 --> 01:24:47.450
* Beautiful this dream
that makes you mine *

01:24:47.883 --> 01:24:49.885
* Ooh

01:24:49.885 --> 01:24:51.954
* Rock me gently

01:24:51.954 --> 01:24:54.123
* Rock me slowly

01:24:54.123 --> 01:24:55.791
* Take it easy

01:24:55.791 --> 01:24:57.526
* Don't you know

01:24:57.526 --> 01:25:02.531
* That I have never been
loved like this before *

01:25:03.699 --> 01:25:05.468
* Baby, baby

01:25:05.468 --> 01:25:07.536
* Rock me gently

01:25:07.536 --> 01:25:09.172
* Rock me slowly

01:25:09.172 --> 01:25:11.039
* Take it easy

01:25:11.039 --> 01:25:12.941
* Don't you know

01:25:12.941 --> 01:25:17.446
* That I have never been
loved like this before *

01:25:17.446 --> 01:25:20.683
(gentle upbeat music)

01:25:25.053 --> 01:25:27.022
* Oh my darlin'

01:25:27.022 --> 01:25:28.957
* Oh my baby

01:25:28.957 --> 01:25:32.928
* You've got the moves
that drive me crazy *

01:25:32.928 --> 01:25:37.065
* And on your face I
see a trace of love *

01:25:37.065 --> 01:25:40.068
* Love, love, love

01:25:41.170 --> 01:25:43.406
- Well that certainly
gave me goosebumps.

01:25:43.406 --> 01:25:45.208
Right, get it guys, goosebumps.

01:25:47.075 --> 01:25:48.777
- Really, that's the ending?

01:25:48.777 --> 01:25:50.979
- Yes, that's the ending.

01:25:50.979 --> 01:25:52.715
- We were really hoping to get

01:25:52.715 --> 01:25:55.551
more zombies.
- Like more zombies.

01:25:56.352 --> 01:25:58.321
- More zombies.

01:25:58.321 --> 01:26:00.456
- It's really nice
that Mike and Amy

01:26:00.456 --> 01:26:02.625
walk away happy and
everything, but.

01:26:02.625 --> 01:26:04.993
- But yeah, a few more
zombies wouldn't hurt.

01:26:04.993 --> 01:26:06.229
- Okay, can we get more zombies?

01:26:06.229 --> 01:26:07.796
That's all I'm saying.

01:26:07.796 --> 01:26:09.498
- You mean like right now?

01:26:09.498 --> 01:26:11.867
Sir, have you been listening
to the conversation?

01:26:11.867 --> 01:26:13.769
- Yeah, I've been listening.

01:26:13.769 --> 01:26:16.205
So you want more zombies?

01:26:16.205 --> 01:26:18.274
Give 'em what they want.

01:26:19.975 --> 01:26:21.810
More zombies.

01:26:21.810 --> 01:26:24.380
(all applauding)

01:26:24.380 --> 01:26:26.081
- Yes, sir, right away.

01:26:27.216 --> 01:26:29.818
Projector room, roll it.

01:26:29.818 --> 01:26:32.455

01:26:47.470 --> 01:26:50.706
(gentle upbeat music)

01:27:06.822 --> 01:27:10.092
* I love you 'til
the day I die *

01:27:10.092 --> 01:27:13.829
* So don't die today,
please don't die today *

01:27:13.829 --> 01:27:17.566
* Everything but
you is an ugly lie *

01:27:17.566 --> 01:27:19.268
* That's not how you pray

01:27:19.268 --> 01:27:21.203
* That's not what you say

01:27:21.203 --> 01:27:24.473
* If I'm here when you're
gone I'll fall apart *

01:27:24.473 --> 01:27:28.176
* Stop your crying love,
stop your crying love *

01:27:28.176 --> 01:27:31.914
* What's the point of
life without my heart *

01:27:31.914 --> 01:27:33.716
* You're not dying now

01:27:33.716 --> 01:27:35.050
* You'll survive somehow

01:27:35.050 --> 01:27:38.787
* Do you want to die together

01:27:38.787 --> 01:27:41.924
* Yes I do, yes I do

01:27:41.924 --> 01:27:46.194

* Yes I do, yes I do

01:27:55.671 --> 01:27:59.575

* I fear the night

01:28:52.294 --> 01:28:56.965
* Don't wanna be here

01:28:56.965 --> 01:28:58.901
* There's a deadly threat

01:28:58.901 --> 01:29:03.906
* And it's getting nearer

01:29:06.675 --> 01:29:08.477

zombie town around here.

01:30:34.997 --> 01:30:38.233

up for you and me

01:30:41.837 --> 01:30:42.838

I been around the
round, round world

01:30:51.580 --> 01:30:54.382
and if indeed the
world is round.

01:30:54.382 --> 01:30:58.053
I've been on the flyways,
highways, byways and train ways.

01:30:58.053 --> 01:31:01.356
I've played the villain,
I've played the fool,

01:31:01.356 --> 01:31:03.258
I've played the clown.

01:31:03.258 --> 01:31:06.394
And I will always remember
the great cast and crew

01:31:06.394 --> 01:31:07.462

01:31:34.990 --> 01:31:37.626
(gentle music)

01:31:39.294 --> 01:31:42.998

01:31:42.998 --> 01:31:46.434

01:31:46.434 --> 01:31:48.937

(gentle music)

01:32:08.757 --> 01:32:13.161

you'll be with me *

01:32:13.161 --> 01:32:15.197
