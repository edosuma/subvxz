00:01.833 --> 00:04.458
[instrumental music]

00:15.875 --> 00:17.250
[device beeping]

00:18.625 --> 00:19.875
[sighs]

00:21.833 --> 00:24.167
Stop program.

00:24.250 --> 00:25.833
Uh...open.

00:29.042 --> 00:32.333
Forgive me for disturbing you
in your quarters, Mr. Garibaldi.

00:32.417 --> 00:34.583
But I've had urgent orders
from Ambassador Delenn.

00:34.667 --> 00:36.417
What can I do for the Minbari?

00:36.500 --> 00:39.583
Shaal Mayan will shortly
be returning here.

00:39.667 --> 00:41.917
In light of the incident
which occurred

00:42.042 --> 00:44.250
during her last visit
to Babylon 5

00:44.333 --> 00:45.542
Ambassador Delenn would like

00:45.625 --> 00:47.417
a full security detail
assigned to her.

00:47.500 --> 00:50.417
Good idea. Give me her itinerary
and I'll arrange it.

00:50.500 --> 00:52.292
Thank you.

00:52.375 --> 00:56.333
E-excuse me, what sort
of machine is this?

00:56.417 --> 00:59.458
Well, it's an Earth antique.
Mint condition.

00:59.542 --> 01:03.625
The Kawasaki Ninja
ZX-11, vintage 1992.

01:03.708 --> 01:06.042
And we're talkin' liquid-cooled
dual overhead cams

01:06.125 --> 01:09.667
16-valve, a 1052 CC,
in-line four

01:09.750 --> 01:12.167
twin Ram Air induction,
6-speed gearbox

01:12.250 --> 01:13.792
and 320 millimeter front disks

01:13.875 --> 01:15.167
with four piston calipers.

01:15.250 --> 01:17.708
It's the best performance bike
of its time.

01:17.792 --> 01:19.000
Or it will be
when I figure out

01:19.083 --> 01:20.625
how to put
the damn thing together.

01:20.708 --> 01:24.750
Well, it sounds most impressive.
Uh, what exactly does it do?

01:24.833 --> 01:29.542
What does it do?
It's a motorcycle.

01:29.625 --> 01:30.792
You ride it!

01:30.875 --> 01:34.250
[imitates engine revving]
Huh?

01:34.333 --> 01:35.875
Ah, a vehicle.

01:35.958 --> 01:37.333
(Garibaldi)
'Oh, it's more
than just a vehicle.'

01:37.417 --> 01:39.000
This baby's a piece
of Earth history.

01:39.083 --> 01:41.333
History.
That is an interest of mine.

01:41.417 --> 01:44.375
Yeah, well, I've been building
this little piece of history

01:44.458 --> 01:45.625
for the last five years

01:45.708 --> 01:48.292
'scrounging parts
wherever I could.'

01:48.375 --> 01:49.667
'Now I've got 'em all
if I could just'

01:49.750 --> 01:51.250
figure out
where they all go.

01:51.333 --> 01:53.167
I won this manual
in a blackjack game

01:53.250 --> 01:56.667
but doesn't do any much good,
it's in Japanese.

01:56.750 --> 01:59.792
Given some time
to study this manual

01:59.875 --> 02:01.958
perhaps I could be of
assistance.

02:03.917 --> 02:07.708
Well, at this point, I'll take
all the help I can get.

02:09.625 --> 02:11.250
- Garibaldi.
- 'Mr. Garibaldi.'

02:11.333 --> 02:13.250
(male #1)
'Please report
to the briefing room.'

02:13.333 --> 02:17.625
On my way. Well, duty calls.

02:17.708 --> 02:19.250
History calls.

02:21.125 --> 02:22.875
[chuckles]

02:23.458 --> 02:25.750
[beeping]

02:30.333 --> 02:32.000
What do you think?

02:32.083 --> 02:35.375
Most of the personnel
will be no trouble.

02:35.458 --> 02:39.542
- This one, however..
- Anything you can't handle?

02:39.625 --> 02:41.750
I don't have to handle it.
Her record's spotless.

02:41.833 --> 02:43.375
There's no need to include her.

02:43.458 --> 02:46.917
That's not your decision,
and she will be included.

02:47.042 --> 02:48.917
Records don't always
tell the whole story.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.083
That's one of the reasons
you're here, Mr. Gray, remember?

02:53.667 --> 02:55.125
As you wish.

02:56.375 --> 02:57.958
When do we begin?

02:58.042 --> 03:01.667
As always, Mr. Gray,
when the time is right.

03:04.917 --> 03:08.542
(male narrator)
It was the dawn
of the Third Age of mankind..

03:08.625 --> 03:11.667
...10 years after
the Earth-Minbari War.

03:11.750 --> 03:15.042
The Babylon Project
was a dream given form.

03:15.125 --> 03:18.500
Its goal, to prevent another
war by creating a place

03:18.583 --> 03:20.583
where humans and aliens
could work out

03:20.667 --> 03:22.417
their differences peacefully.

03:22.500 --> 03:25.375
It's a port of call,
home away from home

03:25.458 --> 03:30.792
for diplomats, hustlers,
entrepreneurs and wanderers.

03:30.875 --> 03:32.583
Humans and aliens, wrapped in

03:32.667 --> 03:35.083
two million,
five hundred thousand tons

03:35.167 --> 03:39.000
of spinning metal,
all alone in the night.

03:40.500 --> 03:42.542
It can be a dangerous place.

03:42.625 --> 03:45.792
But it's our last,
best hope for peace.

03:45.875 --> 03:49.667
This is the story of the last
of the Babylon stations.

03:49.750 --> 03:52.083
The year is 2258.

03:52.167 --> 03:56.000
The name of the place
is Babylon 5.

03:56.083 --> 03:59.125
[theme music]

04:35.000 --> 04:38.042
Mars command confirmed that
the attack on station Phobos

04:38.125 --> 04:40.375
is tied to a series
of terrorist incidents

04:40.458 --> 04:42.500
directed against Earthforce.

04:42.583 --> 04:44.875
- Free Mars?
- They're not sure.

04:44.958 --> 04:47.292
In the last year independence
movements have sprung up

04:47.375 --> 04:50.292
all over the colony, some even
more radical than Free Mars.

04:50.375 --> 04:52.083
Earthforce is concerned
that Babylon 5

04:52.167 --> 04:55.000
will become a source of arms
for the groups and so am I.

04:55.083 --> 04:56.792
(Ivanova)
'It'll be difficult to stop.'

04:56.875 --> 04:58.417
According to our trade
agreements, aliens have

04:58.500 --> 05:00.000
the right to sell arms on B-5

05:00.083 --> 05:02.167
as long as all transfers
take place off-station.

05:02.250 --> 05:04.375
That's why Earth Central
has implemented an embargo

05:04.458 --> 05:07.208
on all unauthorized
arms shipments to Mars colony.

05:07.292 --> 05:09.958
We can't stop a legitimate sale,
but we can notify

05:10.042 --> 05:12.750
Earthforce of any ship
carrying weapons there.

05:12.833 --> 05:15.458
I want all cargos and flight
logs thoroughly checked.

05:15.542 --> 05:18.208
Also watch for known arms
dealers and smugglers

05:18.292 --> 05:21.708
and track of any recent arrivals
from Mars colony.

05:21.792 --> 05:22.958
Will do.

05:24.917 --> 05:26.083
[sighs]

05:27.917 --> 05:31.042
So, how long have you been
stationed here, Officer Welch?

05:31.125 --> 05:33.542
Since B-5 went online.

05:33.625 --> 05:37.417
- Do you like it?
- It beats a kick in the teeth.

05:37.500 --> 05:38.792
How about Commander Sinclair?

05:38.875 --> 05:40.958
Does he beat a kick
in the teeth?

05:42.417 --> 05:44.208
- Do I know you?
- Aaron Franks.

05:44.292 --> 05:46.167
Quartermaster Corporation.

05:46.250 --> 05:47.708
We're hoping
to supply the station

05:47.792 --> 05:50.250
and I'm trying to find out
everything I can.

05:50.333 --> 05:53.750
Well, I'm trying
to eat my lunch. Quietly.

05:53.833 --> 05:55.417
Sorry to bother you.

06:07.750 --> 06:08.958
Station, Assistant Lou Welch.

06:09.042 --> 06:11.000
Patch me through
to Mr. Garibaldi.

06:11.083 --> 06:17.542
(computer)
'And the last gasoline-powered
motorcycle was built in 2035.'

06:19.667 --> 06:23.708
'In popular Earth culture,
the motorcycle was often seen'

06:23.792 --> 06:27.625
'as a symbol of independence
of spirit, freedom'

06:27.708 --> 06:31.667
'sexual prowess and rebellion.'

06:31.750 --> 06:35.250
"Sexual prowess and rebellion."

06:39.750 --> 06:41.792
[dramatic music]

06:52.917 --> 06:56.000
[crowd clamoring]

07:00.083 --> 07:02.167
- Hey, Jax.
- Mr. Garibaldi.

07:02.250 --> 07:04.000
That guy who was just talking
to you, what did he want?

07:04.083 --> 07:05.833
Uh, he said his name
was Aaron Franks.

07:05.917 --> 07:08.000
Um, he was asking questions
about Commander Sinclair

07:08.083 --> 07:10.167
how often he stopped by here,
who he drank with?

07:10.250 --> 07:14.375
It didn't make much sense, but
that's nothing new around here.

07:14.458 --> 07:15.708
Thanks.

07:19.542 --> 07:21.708
Commander, I think
we have a problem.

07:21.792 --> 07:23.333
Some guy named Aaron Franks
has been asking

07:23.417 --> 07:25.292
a lot of odd questions
all over the station.

07:25.375 --> 07:27.917
- What kind of questions?
- About you. About the station.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.583
He arrived three days ago
from LeGrange 2

07:29.667 --> 07:31.333
with another man
named Harriman Gray.

07:31.417 --> 07:33.167
According to their credentials,
they're business agents

07:33.250 --> 07:35.042
representing
Quartermaster Corporation.

07:35.125 --> 07:37.708
I checked, and as far
as I can tell, they're legit.

07:37.792 --> 07:40.292
QM Corporation is an independent
military supplier.

07:40.375 --> 07:42.375
They could be looking
for a contract.

07:42.458 --> 07:44.500
Or they could have the perfect
cover for arms smugglers.

07:44.583 --> 07:47.583
LeGrange 2 is a stone's throw
from Mars colony.

07:47.667 --> 07:50.542
Have a talk with Mr. Franks.
But walk softly.

07:50.625 --> 07:53.333
The last thing we need
is a corporate lawsuit.

07:58.792 --> 08:00.042
[intercom beeps]

08:02.667 --> 08:04.208
Yes?

08:04.292 --> 08:05.792
(Garibaldi)
'This is Security Chief
Garibaldi.'

08:05.875 --> 08:07.833
'I'd like to speak to Aaron
Franks.'

08:08.625 --> 08:10.208
He's not in.

08:10.292 --> 08:12.750
(Garibaldi)
'In that case,
I'd like to speak to you.'

08:15.833 --> 08:18.042
Uh, a moment, please.

08:20.042 --> 08:21.417
[sniffles]

08:24.250 --> 08:25.417
Open.

08:27.833 --> 08:29.458
Mr. Gray?

08:29.542 --> 08:31.417
Is there something I can
help you with something?

08:31.500 --> 08:32.958
You're and Mr. Franks,
are business agents

08:33.042 --> 08:35.000
for Quartermaster Corporation,
is that correct?

08:35.083 --> 08:36.583
Yes, we're hoping to get
a military

08:36.667 --> 08:38.542
supply contract with Babylon 5.

08:38.625 --> 08:40.750
Then why haven't you spoken
to Commander Sinclair?

08:40.833 --> 08:44.000
You've been here for three days.

08:44.083 --> 08:48.583
- Aaron, this is--
- Mr. Garibaldi. Very good.

08:48.667 --> 08:51.333
- You know me?
- Intimately.

08:51.417 --> 08:53.917
- Fix you a drink?
- I don't drink.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
Really? Good.

08:57.083 --> 09:00.042
It's a vile habit when abused.

09:00.125 --> 09:04.458
It makes a soldier weak.
Gets him in a lot of trouble.

09:04.542 --> 09:06.167
You're starting
to irritate me, Mr. Franks

09:06.250 --> 09:09.083
and I don't like being
irritated. It gives me gas.

09:09.167 --> 09:10.875
The name isn't Franks.

09:10.958 --> 09:15.083
It's Colonel Ari Ben Zayn,
Earthforce Internal Affairs.

09:15.167 --> 09:17.958
- You're Eyes?
- I'm an internal investigator.

09:18.042 --> 09:21.542
Mr. Gray is a military
specialist from Psi Corps.

09:21.625 --> 09:23.167
We're here to make a special
investigation

09:23.250 --> 09:25.292
of Babylon 5 command staff.

09:27.458 --> 09:29.833
[dramatic music]

09:32.208 --> 09:34.708
[dramatic music]

09:36.542 --> 09:39.208
(Colonel Ari)
'Recent events on Mars colony
and elsewhere'

09:39.292 --> 09:40.958
'have shown the need
for increased scrutiny'

09:41.042 --> 09:43.792
'of all off-world
installations.'

09:43.875 --> 09:45.583
Similar investigations
are taking place

09:45.667 --> 09:47.625
on all our outposts,
we must know

09:47.708 --> 09:51.167
who is loyal to Earthforce
and who isn't.

09:51.250 --> 09:53.625
As commander of Babylon 5,
I personally vouch

09:53.708 --> 09:55.708
for the loyalty
of every member of my staff.

09:55.792 --> 09:57.667
And I resent your tactics,
you have no right

09:57.750 --> 09:59.875
to snoop around the station
without my knowledge.

09:59.958 --> 10:02.042
I have every right, commander!

10:02.125 --> 10:05.417
My authority comes directly
from the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

10:08.250 --> 10:11.083
'I'm not here
to persecute anyone.'

10:11.167 --> 10:12.583
I just want to ask
some questions

10:12.667 --> 10:14.750
and clarify a few details.

10:14.833 --> 10:16.333
It's all fairly routine.

10:16.417 --> 10:19.875
And what part does Psi Corp
play in this routine?

10:19.958 --> 10:21.375
Regulations prohibit
the use of telepaths

10:21.458 --> 10:23.125
in commander-level
investigation.

10:23.208 --> 10:26.042
There are new regulations,
Lieutenant Commander Ivanova.

10:26.125 --> 10:29.292
And under that all staff must
submit to telepathic scan

10:29.375 --> 10:32.000
as part
of an official investigation.

10:32.083 --> 10:35.167
- Command staff as well.
- The hell I will.

10:35.250 --> 10:36.917
Psi Corp may be running
the rest of the world--

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
Ivanova.

10:39.083 --> 10:42.250
I'll check these
new regulations, colonel.

10:42.333 --> 10:43.708
Meanwhile, I'll have someone
show you

10:43.792 --> 10:45.875
'and Mr. Gray to new quarters
in Blue Sector.'

10:45.958 --> 10:49.250
- Mr. Garibaldi will escort me.
- Mr. Garibaldi has duties.

10:49.333 --> 10:51.042
Not anymore, I'm assigning him

10:51.125 --> 10:54.125
to my staff for the duration
of this investigation.

10:54.208 --> 10:57.292
- What?
- I like his style.

10:57.375 --> 11:00.042
As chief of security,
Mr. Garibaldi is essential

11:00.125 --> 11:01.625
to the operation
of this station.

11:01.708 --> 11:05.542
Is there some problem
with Babylon 5 security?

11:05.625 --> 11:07.292
You made no mention of it
in your last report.

11:07.375 --> 11:09.333
No, there's no problem--

11:09.417 --> 11:12.208
(Colonel Ari)
'Then Garibaldi's second can
handle it for a few days.'

11:12.292 --> 11:15.125
I need him to expedite
this matter.

11:15.208 --> 11:18.125
I'll present you with
an interview schedule shortly.

11:26.042 --> 11:28.583
You may carry on, commander.

11:35.375 --> 11:36.542
Mr. Gray.

11:37.417 --> 11:38.750
Mr. Garibaldi.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.792
A pleasure to meet you all.

11:50.000 --> 11:54.625
By God, if I ever find out
who's behind this circus act!

11:54.708 --> 11:57.292
I will not submit to
a telepathic scan, commander.

11:57.375 --> 11:59.208
It's against my person
and my principles.

11:59.292 --> 12:00.917
I don't like it any better than
you do.

12:01.000 --> 12:05.250
Enough people have played with
my brain already this year.

12:05.333 --> 12:09.208
Return to duty.
And I won't let it happen.

12:09.292 --> 12:11.083
To either of us.

12:14.208 --> 12:18.458
Computer, subject.
Earthforce law.

12:18.542 --> 12:21.458
(computer)
'Accessing files.'

12:21.542 --> 12:23.125
You're not happy
about this investigation

12:23.208 --> 12:24.625
are you, Mr. Garibaldi?

12:24.708 --> 12:26.708
Do I have the colonel's
permission to speak freely?

12:26.792 --> 12:28.042
Getting the truth is my job.

12:28.125 --> 12:29.667
I expect to hear it
whenever you talk to me.

12:29.750 --> 12:31.042
Well, in that case,
I think this is

12:31.125 --> 12:32.917
the biggest pile of horse hockey
I ever saw.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.583
Who the hell's running
Earthforce, Abbott and Costello?

12:35.667 --> 12:36.833
[laughs]

12:39.833 --> 12:42.875
Abbott and Costello,
I like them.

12:42.958 --> 12:46.208
I require all your security
files regarding Babylon 5 staff

12:46.292 --> 12:48.958
including classified
and confidential files.

12:49.042 --> 12:51.917
- You'll have it in the morning.
- Tonight, Mr. Garibaldi!

12:52.000 --> 12:53.375
Do it personally.

12:53.458 --> 12:54.667
When they're compiled

12:54.750 --> 12:57.417
bring them here immediately.

12:57.500 --> 12:59.042
Yes, sir.

13:02.583 --> 13:04.917
- M-Mr. Garibaldi.
- Mr. Lennier?

13:05.000 --> 13:06.083
Something wrong
with the security

13:06.167 --> 13:07.625
arrangements for Shaal Mayan's
visit?

13:07.708 --> 13:10.333
Oh, no, no, they're
quite satisfactory. Thank you.

13:10.417 --> 13:14.708
I-I wish to speak with you
about the, the bike.

13:14.792 --> 13:16.167
- What about it?
- Well, I believe..

13:16.250 --> 13:18.042
I could help you assemble it.
Quite easily.

13:18.125 --> 13:20.708
Although there are few points
that I'm confused about.

13:20.792 --> 13:23.417
Mr. Lennier,
I'm too busy for this right now.

13:23.500 --> 13:26.583
Well, then perhaps I could
begin the work for you.

13:26.667 --> 13:29.542
With Ambassador Delenn off
station, my duties are small.

13:29.625 --> 13:31.333
And it would be good
to be of use.

13:31.417 --> 13:33.292
- I don't think...
- I must admit, Mr. Garibaldi.

13:33.375 --> 13:35.167
I've become fascinated
by this vehicle.

13:35.250 --> 13:36.583
Do you realize
that it was a symbol

13:36.667 --> 13:39.708
of masculinity in your society
at one time?

13:39.792 --> 13:42.708
Okay, okay, fine, I'll clear
you for access to my quarters.

13:42.792 --> 13:44.833
- But if you damage anything--
- I assure you.

13:44.917 --> 13:47.417
I will exercise extreme caution.

13:47.500 --> 13:49.667
And thank you, very much.

13:58.458 --> 14:00.708
Computer,
this is Michael Garibaldi

14:00.792 --> 14:03.292
chief of security.
Confirm voice ID.

14:03.375 --> 14:05.583
(computer)
'Confirmed. Command?'

14:05.667 --> 14:08.583
Transfer all files pertaining to
Earthforce military personnel

14:08.667 --> 14:11.625
stationed on Babylon 5
to crystal port.

14:11.708 --> 14:13.250
Include secure files.

14:13.333 --> 14:16.917
(computer)
'Please input proper code
and password.'

14:19.500 --> 14:21.750
- Peekaboo.
- 'Commencing.'

14:21.833 --> 14:26.583
(computer)
'Transfer will take 1.4 hours.'

14:26.667 --> 14:29.833
(man on radio)
'Sector 2, we're all green
down here.'

14:29.917 --> 14:32.333
While that's working,
load interweb program.

14:32.417 --> 14:34.083
(computer)
'Parameters?'

14:34.167 --> 14:36.958
All info on Colonel Ari Ben
Zayn, Earthforce Internal

14:37.042 --> 14:40.625
and Mr. Harriman Gray,
Psi Corp military specialist.

14:40.708 --> 14:44.042
The usual sources.
Code all responses Gold-2.

14:44.125 --> 14:47.708
(computer)
'Acknowledged.
Commencing interweb link.'

14:49.042 --> 14:52.083
[dramatic music]

14:54.917 --> 14:58.208
(Ivanova)
'Confirmed, Epsilon. Clear to
begin zero-G cargo transfer.'

15:02.875 --> 15:04.125
Lieutenant commander?

15:04.208 --> 15:05.958
Civilians are not allowed
on the observation dome

15:06.042 --> 15:08.583
without authorization from
Commander Sinclair. Please go.

15:08.667 --> 15:11.458
Well, as the colonel's liaison
I have every right to be here.

15:11.542 --> 15:15.958
So relax, I just wanted to look
at the stars for a moment.

15:16.042 --> 15:18.333
They never lose their beauty,
do they?

15:18.417 --> 15:21.750
- Mr. Gray, I am very busy.
- Lieutenant commander.

15:21.833 --> 15:24.208
I'm aware of your hostility
toward Psi Corps

15:24.292 --> 15:26.042
and the reason for it.

15:26.125 --> 15:27.958
- And I sympathize.
- You do? How nice.

15:28.042 --> 15:29.958
I shall send you a card
on your birthday.

15:30.042 --> 15:33.208
[chuckles]
You know, when I was a boy

15:33.292 --> 15:36.333
I dreamed of
being a combat pilot.

15:36.417 --> 15:39.708
I built models of every space
fighter that was available.

15:39.792 --> 15:43.500
I collected squadron patches.
It was all I ever wanted to be.

15:43.583 --> 15:47.792
When I was 16, I applied
to Air Dome and I was accepted.

15:47.875 --> 15:52.042
And then my talent manifested
itself the first month

15:52.125 --> 15:54.667
and telepaths aren't allowed
in regular military service.

15:54.750 --> 15:57.667
- So I was expelled.
- I'm so sorry.

16:01.250 --> 16:03.000
It's not easy to have
your dreams snatched away

16:03.083 --> 16:04.875
just because you're different.

16:04.958 --> 16:08.292
And I didn't take it very well.
Then the Corps came.

16:08.375 --> 16:10.542
They said I could still serve
in Earthforce

16:10.625 --> 16:12.208
as a Psi Corps liaison.

16:12.292 --> 16:14.292
A boyhood dream come true.
I'm in tears.

16:14.375 --> 16:16.500
It saved my life.
Gave me purpose again.

16:16.583 --> 16:18.875
And granted it's not the same
as your kind of soldiering

16:18.958 --> 16:20.792
but part of a dream
is better than none..

16:20.875 --> 16:22.833
Is there a point to this story,
Mr. Gray?

16:22.917 --> 16:25.917
I just want you to know
I love the Force.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.250
And respect the people
like you who serve in it.

16:28.333 --> 16:30.917
A pretty speech. Did the colonel
write this for you?

16:31.000 --> 16:34.417
No, but he's going to insist
that everyone be scanned.

16:34.500 --> 16:36.375
And it's just easier
if you accept that.

16:36.458 --> 16:40.083
Now, I give you my word, I'll
respect your personal privacy.

16:40.167 --> 16:41.583
The only thoughts
I'll be looking for

16:41.667 --> 16:44.708
are those concerned wit
h your duties in Earthforce.

16:44.792 --> 16:47.083
And given your record,
I'm certain

16:47.167 --> 16:49.042
you have nothing to fear.

16:49.125 --> 16:53.417
Mr. Gray, I'm grateful Psi Corps
has given you a purpose in life.

16:53.500 --> 16:55.625
When that purpose includes
scanning my mind

16:55.708 --> 16:57.792
to prove my loyalty,
it's not only invasion

16:57.875 --> 17:00.375
of my privacy but my honor!

17:00.458 --> 17:03.167
As for fear, if you
enter my mind for any reason

17:03.250 --> 17:07.167
I will twist your head off
and use it for a chamber pot!

17:07.250 --> 17:08.750
If you'll excuse me.

17:11.708 --> 17:14.375
[intense music]

17:16.625 --> 17:19.375
[dramatic music]

17:26.250 --> 17:30.125
(Colonel Ari)
'These Vorlons have been trouble
ever since they arrived.'

17:30.208 --> 17:33.708
Yeah, well, they're like that.
Real fun guys.

17:33.792 --> 17:35.625
And yet Commander Sinclair
made no protest

17:35.708 --> 17:37.917
against their actions
in the Deathwalker affair.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.917
Odd, don't you think?

17:40.000 --> 17:41.667
Protests are
as much use with the Vorlons

17:41.750 --> 17:44.292
as fairy wings
on a cement truck.

17:44.375 --> 17:46.542
If you have anything else to ask
about the commander's decisions

17:46.625 --> 17:49.250
I suggest you ask him, sir.

17:49.333 --> 17:52.375
I intend to. At 1200.
Inform him.

17:52.458 --> 17:56.083
Then get some sack time.
I'll want you there too.

17:56.167 --> 17:58.833
If I knew who God was,
I'd thank her.

18:01.625 --> 18:04.667
[intense music]

18:10.542 --> 18:13.875
Mr. Garibaldi, you look like
the back end of an Orion slich.

18:13.958 --> 18:16.667
Oh, and a gracious
good morning to you, commander.

18:16.750 --> 18:19.042
I've been up all night
with Colonel Ben Hitler.

18:19.125 --> 18:20.667
He wants to interview you
at 1200.

18:20.750 --> 18:23.083
Good, the sooner we get this
lunacy disposed off

18:23.167 --> 18:25.250
the quicker we can get back
to doing our job.

18:25.333 --> 18:27.458
Look, this is no
routine investigation, Jeff.

18:27.542 --> 18:29.208
Ben Zayn's questioning
everything that's happened

18:29.292 --> 18:31.292
in the past year
from Raghesh III, Deathwalker

18:31.375 --> 18:33.000
the Darker Strike,
Jason Ironheart

18:33.083 --> 18:35.500
'to the sabotage attempt
during the president's visit.'

18:35.583 --> 18:38.167
'He's questioning every major
command decision you've made.'

18:38.250 --> 18:39.833
Let him, they're all
on the record

18:39.917 --> 18:41.250
and they've all been approved.

18:41.333 --> 18:43.208
That won't stop him.
You know how Eyes work.

18:43.292 --> 18:44.958
They're like judge and jury.

18:45.042 --> 18:46.875
'They twist the facts
to their own satisfaction'

18:47.000 --> 18:49.875
and always assume you have
something to hide.

18:49.958 --> 18:51.958
- Maybe we do.
- Explain.

18:52.042 --> 18:53.750
(Garibaldi)
'Look, I know you're
a by-the-book guy, Jeff'

18:53.833 --> 18:55.417
but let's face it.

18:55.500 --> 18:58.417
We've rewritten the book
a few times to make B-5 work.

18:58.500 --> 19:00.375
And made a few enemies
along the way.

19:00.458 --> 19:02.042
You know what's happening
back on Earth

19:02.125 --> 19:03.625
on Mars, all over the alliance.

19:03.708 --> 19:05.625
The president's being
attacked on all sides.

19:05.708 --> 19:07.542
'Off-world groups are screaming
for independence.'

19:07.625 --> 19:09.292
Earth Central's falling apart

19:09.375 --> 19:11.042
anti-alien groups are spreading
their poison

19:11.125 --> 19:12.667
everywhere on and on and on.

19:12.750 --> 19:14.833
Guys like Ben Zayn thrive
in that kinda climate.

19:14.917 --> 19:17.000
(Sinclair)
'All the more reason
to stand up to him, Michael.'

19:17.083 --> 19:19.167
Earth Alliance may have problems
but they can't be solved

19:19.250 --> 19:20.875
by trampling on human dignity.

19:20.958 --> 19:22.417
Yeah. What about Psi Corps?

19:22.500 --> 19:24.792
Ironheart warned us about them
pulling the strings.

19:24.875 --> 19:27.542
- I'll deal with them too.
- Alright, look.

19:27.625 --> 19:30.917
This time,
you walk soft, Jeff.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.625
I've seen this kind of
witch-hunt before.

19:32.708 --> 19:35.125
It can get ugly. Um..

19:35.208 --> 19:37.042
I'm checking a few sources
to try to find some data

19:37.125 --> 19:39.042
on these two guys,
just in case it does.

19:39.125 --> 19:42.708
I appreciate it, Michael.
We'll come through it alright.

19:42.792 --> 19:46.000
- Now, get some sleep.
- Oh, I intend to.

19:49.208 --> 19:52.333
[chanting in foreign language]

20:05.583 --> 20:08.500
Ah, Mr. Garibaldi,
I was just about to embark

20:08.583 --> 20:11.167
on the mysteries
of the fuel injection system.

20:11.250 --> 20:13.792
- Would you care to join me?
- 'Well, do me a favor.'

20:13.875 --> 20:15.125
Embark on a journey
to your quarters

20:15.208 --> 20:16.792
so I can get some sleep.

20:16.875 --> 20:19.458
Please forgive me,
my enthusiasm for this project

20:19.542 --> 20:21.750
has made me insensitive
to your needs.

20:21.833 --> 20:24.750
I will leave at once.

20:24.833 --> 20:27.000
When may I begin the work again?

20:29.000 --> 20:31.458
If I kill him,
I would start a war.

20:33.167 --> 20:35.458
Come back after 1200.

20:35.542 --> 20:36.875
Domo Arigato.

20:39.833 --> 20:41.125
[chuckles softly]

20:44.333 --> 20:45.542
Not bad.

20:46.917 --> 20:48.167
Not bad.

20:50.750 --> 20:53.833
[intense music]

20:56.833 --> 20:58.875
[evil laugh]

21:02.417 --> 21:04.458
[indistinct whispering]

21:05.625 --> 21:08.667
[evil laughter]

21:14.792 --> 21:17.875
[whispering continues]

21:20.667 --> 21:22.708
[echoing]
Susan!

21:24.917 --> 21:27.458
(female #1)
'Susan Ivanova!'

21:29.625 --> 21:31.250
(Sofie)
'Susan, here.'

21:34.583 --> 21:36.042
(Susan)
'Momma?'

21:36.125 --> 21:37.500
Suzotchka.

21:42.542 --> 21:45.583
[dramatic music]

21:47.583 --> 21:50.292
Will it make the voices go away?

21:50.375 --> 21:54.417
No, but it will make them
sing like birds, Sofie.

21:56.333 --> 21:59.625
A shame if you refuse
to cooperate.

21:59.708 --> 22:04.292
Momma, don't let them do it.
Don't let them!

22:04.375 --> 22:07.833
Don't interfere, soldier.
The colonel insists.

22:11.292 --> 22:12.583
[zapping]

22:16.750 --> 22:18.375
[screams]
Momma!

22:18.458 --> 22:20.875
Only one way out.

22:20.958 --> 22:23.083
Only one way.

22:23.167 --> 22:25.667
[whirring]

22:26.750 --> 22:29.292
Momma? Momma!

22:29.375 --> 22:30.667
[sobbing]

22:32.375 --> 22:36.792
She'll be fine.
Now, do you hear the birds?

22:36.875 --> 22:39.083
A real shame.

22:40.792 --> 22:42.625
Momma, it's me Susan.

22:48.208 --> 22:49.583
Only one way out.

22:51.375 --> 22:53.333
Only one way.

22:53.417 --> 22:55.250
[screaming]

22:55.333 --> 22:56.833
[gasping]

22:56.917 --> 23:00.375
[crying]
Momma?

23:01.875 --> 23:04.292
[gasping]
Lights.

23:05.958 --> 23:08.500
[deep breathing]

23:13.250 --> 23:16.542
(computer)
'Article 35 of the Earthforce
code states'

23:16.625 --> 23:20.583
'that a hearing must be held
before five senior officers.'

23:20.667 --> 23:23.167
- 'In some instances..'
- Come.

23:23.250 --> 23:27.292
My apologies, commander,
but this matter can't wait.

23:27.375 --> 23:28.708
What's this about?

23:28.792 --> 23:30.792
I wish to resign my commission
effective immediately.

23:30.875 --> 23:32.000
What?

23:32.083 --> 23:34.250
I had a talk with Mr. Gray,
last night.

23:34.333 --> 23:35.458
He said that the colonel
will insist

23:35.542 --> 23:36.917
that I be scanned.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.542
I cannot allow that, and this is
the only way to avoid it.

23:39.625 --> 23:41.292
Without putting you
in a bad position.

23:41.375 --> 23:44.000
Forget it. I refuse to accept
your resignation.

23:44.083 --> 23:46.083
I'm within my rights.

23:46.167 --> 23:47.500
I won't have the Psi Corps
probing me

23:47.583 --> 23:49.250
like some sort
of a lab specimen.

23:49.333 --> 23:52.042
And I won't have you ruin your
career or leave Babylon 5.

23:52.125 --> 23:53.667
You're too important to me.

23:53.750 --> 23:55.750
Besides, I've found a way
to avoid the scans

23:55.833 --> 23:58.208
within the regulations.

23:58.292 --> 24:01.333
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

24:01.417 --> 24:02.708
[sighs]

24:05.833 --> 24:08.083
Uh, may I borrow your PPG

24:08.167 --> 24:09.625
to shoot myself
squarly in the head?

24:09.708 --> 24:12.333
That won't be necessary.
This time.

24:12.417 --> 24:16.333
[chuckles]
Thank you, commander.

24:16.417 --> 24:18.833
- 'Susan.'
- Yes?

24:18.917 --> 24:20.625
(Sinclair)
'Why are so you afraid
of being scanned?'

24:20.708 --> 24:22.667
Surely, your mother
must have made contact

24:22.750 --> 24:24.875
with your mind
at one time or another.

24:24.958 --> 24:26.708
Yes, she did.

24:26.792 --> 24:29.042
You can't imagine
what it's like..

24:29.125 --> 24:32.000
...to share your
own mother's love for you.

24:32.083 --> 24:34.833
To feel it in your thoughts.

24:34.917 --> 24:37.917
No one's ever been that close
to me, commander.

24:38.000 --> 24:41.042
And no one must ever
intrude upon that memory.

24:41.125 --> 24:42.750
Especially Psi Corps.

24:45.958 --> 24:47.208
[sighs]

24:54.042 --> 24:56.792
Aren't you tired
of studying that file?

24:56.875 --> 24:59.875
Sinclair is a complex man.

24:59.958 --> 25:02.417
I need to know
everything about him.

25:02.500 --> 25:05.208
Including his secrets.

25:05.292 --> 25:08.250
You know Psi Corps rules
prohibit deep scans--

25:08.333 --> 25:10.542
Don't be naive, Harriman.

25:10.625 --> 25:12.833
Psi Corps want this
as much as I do.

25:12.917 --> 25:16.417
Sinclair got one
of your people killed.

25:16.500 --> 25:20.583
Mr. Bester will appreciate
anything that you can turn up.

25:20.667 --> 25:21.875
Bester?

25:26.375 --> 25:29.292
- Colonel.
- Commander, please take a seat.

25:29.375 --> 25:32.792
I will, as soon as Mr. Gray
leaves the room.

25:34.542 --> 25:38.208
You did check the regulations,
didn't you, commander?

25:38.292 --> 25:41.875
Thoroughly, I also checked
Earthforce law and the opinion

25:41.958 --> 25:45.292
of the Senate Military Bureaus
to the interpretation of them.

25:45.375 --> 25:47.125
They clearly state
that telepathic scans

25:47.208 --> 25:49.583
are allowed only to determine
the truth of specific charges

25:49.667 --> 25:51.167
brought in an internal
investigation.

25:51.250 --> 25:54.000
They are not meant as a blanket
for loyalty checks.

26:02.750 --> 26:06.667
Interpreting regulations
for a senior officer

26:06.750 --> 26:09.458
could be considered
insubordination.

26:09.542 --> 26:12.458
No, sir, I am simply exercising
command privilege

26:12.542 --> 26:14.083
to officially question
a new regulation

26:14.167 --> 26:17.042
as outlined by Article 35
of the Earthforce Code.

26:17.125 --> 26:18.792
In case you're not
familiar with it, it requires

26:18.875 --> 26:21.292
a hearing
before five senior officers.

26:21.375 --> 26:23.792
Until such a hearing is held,
I'm within my rights

26:23.875 --> 26:27.625
to refuse a scan on myself
or on any member of my crew.

26:29.083 --> 26:31.667
I believe that the commander
is correct about the regulation.

26:31.750 --> 26:34.667
Even Psi Corps doesn't consider
it a carte blanche rule.

26:34.750 --> 26:38.292
I don't remember asking
for your opinion, Mr. Gray.

26:41.333 --> 26:44.708
Very well, commander. We'll play
your game for the moment.

26:44.792 --> 26:46.750
Harriman, you're dismissed.

26:49.917 --> 26:53.500
Mr. Garibaldi, you will join me
as an official witness

26:53.583 --> 26:55.167
to this interview.

26:55.250 --> 26:56.667
'We wouldn't want
the commander to feel'

26:56.750 --> 26:59.000
'his rights
were being violated.'

27:00.125 --> 27:01.417
Commander?

27:08.667 --> 27:13.125
We will begin with your actions
during the Raghesh III incident.

27:15.167 --> 27:17.250
[indistinct chatter]

27:25.375 --> 27:26.667
Hi.

27:28.208 --> 27:31.250
[dramatic music]

27:45.333 --> 27:49.375
Commander Ivanova,
may I sit down?

27:49.458 --> 27:52.042
Aren't you supposed to be
peeking into someone's mind?

27:52.125 --> 27:53.375
[chuckles]

27:55.500 --> 27:58.208
You're very charming,
in an odd sort of way.

27:58.292 --> 28:00.083
Uh, the fact is,
I've been dismissed.

28:00.167 --> 28:03.583
It seems Commander Sinclair
knows the regulations very well.

28:03.667 --> 28:07.333
Well, the commander prizes
knowledge and honesty.

28:07.417 --> 28:08.750
So I noticed.

28:08.833 --> 28:11.250
I will long savor the look
on the colonel's face.

28:11.333 --> 28:13.500
Not many people are willing to
stand up to him.

28:13.583 --> 28:15.708
It was very refreshing.

28:15.792 --> 28:19.292
I'm curious. You're not like
most Psi Corp people.

28:19.375 --> 28:21.208
You don't seem overly fond
of the colonel.

28:21.292 --> 28:22.417
I'm not.

28:22.500 --> 28:24.750
He's efficient,
but he lacks compassion.

28:24.833 --> 28:27.167
Sometimes I wonder
if he's even human.

28:27.250 --> 28:29.375
As for Psi Corp,
I doubt you really know

28:29.458 --> 28:32.625
any of our people well,
especially Miss Winters.

28:32.708 --> 28:34.292
- You're scanning me!
- I'm sorry.

28:34.375 --> 28:36.000
The thought of Miss Winters
was loud in your mind

28:36.083 --> 28:38.125
when I mentioned Psi Corps,
I couldn't help but pick it up.

28:38.208 --> 28:39.417
Please forgive me.

28:40.708 --> 28:44.708
I am surprised
you were aware of it. Unless..

28:44.792 --> 28:47.125
Of course, she must have been
in your mind numerous times

28:47.208 --> 28:50.708
before she was given
the sleepers. Your mother..

28:50.792 --> 28:54.292
You are never
to discuss my mother! Ever!

28:54.375 --> 28:55.625
Is that clear?

28:58.125 --> 28:59.750
- Ivanova.
- 'Lieutenant commander.'

28:59.833 --> 29:02.792
(male #2)
'You're needed
in the observation dome.'

29:13.458 --> 29:16.125
(Colonel Ari)
'You allocated 1.3 million
credits from'

29:16.208 --> 29:19.917
the military budget to settle
an illegal civilian strike.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.292
You consider that
a responsible act?

29:22.375 --> 29:24.000
I was given authority
to end the strike

29:24.083 --> 29:28.167
by any means necessary and we
had no use for the credits.

29:28.250 --> 29:30.042
- Sinclair.
- 'Commander.'

29:30.125 --> 29:32.500
(Ivanova)
'We've had a further development
on one of those arms deal.'

29:32.583 --> 29:35.000
This is Colonel Ben Zayn,
Commander Sinclair

29:35.083 --> 29:36.500
is in the middle
of an investigation

29:36.583 --> 29:38.292
and cannot be disturbed,
whatever it is

29:38.375 --> 29:40.125
lieutenant commander, handle it.

29:40.208 --> 29:43.833
I've had enough of this. Your
insinuations are bad enough.

29:43.917 --> 29:46.000
'But when you interfere with
the operation of this station--'

29:46.083 --> 29:49.333
Sit down, commander.
You haven't been dismissed.

29:49.417 --> 29:53.375
The hell I will. You have a
complaint against me, make it.

29:53.458 --> 29:55.875
Otherwise this interview
is over.

29:57.208 --> 29:59.958
Stand fast, mister!

30:00.042 --> 30:01.917
I've seen plenty like you.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.958
Hotshots, promoted out
through the ranks

30:04.042 --> 30:06.542
without any real leadership
ability.

30:06.625 --> 30:09.000
You think because you fought
on the Line

30:09.083 --> 30:11.417
normal military standards
don't apply to you.

30:11.500 --> 30:13.708
'Well, think again, hero.'

30:13.792 --> 30:15.708
As of this moment, I am
relieving you of command

30:15.792 --> 30:18.750
pending a full inquiry
before a military tribunal.

30:18.833 --> 30:20.750
- What?
- You heard me.

30:20.833 --> 30:23.333
I'm assuming command
of Babylon 5.

30:23.417 --> 30:25.792
As of now, I'm in charge.

30:27.792 --> 30:30.292
- You son of a--
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy, Jeff.

30:30.375 --> 30:33.875
He's trying to bait you and he's
hoping you swallow it whole.

30:39.333 --> 30:41.583
What's your justification
for this action?

30:41.667 --> 30:44.250
Beyond the facts that I am
working with direct authority

30:44.333 --> 30:47.500
of the Joint Chiefs,
I also outrank you.

30:47.583 --> 30:51.208
And Article 52, "A commander
found to be working

30:51.292 --> 30:53.625
"against the best interests
of Earthforce may be

30:53.708 --> 30:57.250
summarily removed from his post
by a superior officer."

30:57.333 --> 30:58.917
Oh, give me a break.
You can't prove that.

30:59.000 --> 31:03.250
Yes, I can, Mr. Garibaldi.
With the help of Mr. Gray.

31:03.333 --> 31:06.250
As I am bringing specific
charges, the regulations

31:06.333 --> 31:09.042
on telepathic scan now apply.

31:09.125 --> 31:10.917
We will re-convene here
in one hour

31:11.000 --> 31:13.917
to continue this investigation.

31:19.292 --> 31:21.333
One more thing.

31:21.417 --> 31:25.792
Mr. Sinclair will be confined
to his quarters.

31:25.875 --> 31:27.833
He's not to take part
in command action

31:27.917 --> 31:29.125
or have any further contact

31:29.208 --> 31:32.292
with Babylon 5 staff,
yourself included.

31:32.375 --> 31:35.000
Understood, Mr. Garibaldi?

31:36.458 --> 31:39.500
[intense music]

31:53.167 --> 31:54.958
Things are worse
than I thought, Michael.

31:55.042 --> 31:56.458
I'll have to go directly to HQ.

31:56.542 --> 31:58.917
See if your sources have
uncovered anything on Ben Zayn.

31:59.042 --> 32:01.375
But first get to the dome.

32:01.458 --> 32:03.875
Ivanova.

32:03.958 --> 32:06.750
I'll expect reports
from all your stations

32:06.833 --> 32:10.333
by 1700 sharp.

32:10.417 --> 32:12.667
That's all for now.

32:19.542 --> 32:21.708
[indistinct announcements]

32:23.083 --> 32:25.083
Mr. Garibaldi,
what the hell is going on?

32:25.167 --> 32:27.792
- I wish I had a clue.
- Lieutenant Commander.

32:27.875 --> 32:29.833
At 1500,
Mr. Garibaldi will escort

32:29.917 --> 32:32.250
you to Blue 8
for a formal inquiry.

32:32.333 --> 32:35.000
Mr. Gray will also be present.

32:35.083 --> 32:38.125
I'll be in my quarters
until then.

32:39.833 --> 32:41.250
I don't know
what this guy's after

32:41.333 --> 32:43.667
but he's pulling out
all the stops to get it.

32:43.750 --> 32:45.000
I won't submit to a scan.

32:45.083 --> 32:46.542
He'll charge you
with insubordination.

32:46.625 --> 32:48.875
And I'll be replaced and
dishonorably discharged.

32:48.958 --> 32:51.667
It's a very Russian ending.
I should've expected it.

32:51.750 --> 32:54.708
Station 1, ask Major Atambe
to take my post.

32:56.792 --> 32:59.167
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

32:59.250 --> 33:00.875
Ivanova!

33:02.625 --> 33:05.042
Hey, hey, hey, wait up.

33:05.125 --> 33:06.417
Am I wrong
or are you leaving your post?

33:06.500 --> 33:07.792
Yes, I am.

33:07.875 --> 33:09.375
I've always been proud
to be a member of Earthforce

33:09.458 --> 33:11.167
but right now,
I'd sooner serve the Minbari.

33:11.250 --> 33:13.667
At least they've got
a sense of honor.

33:13.750 --> 33:15.250
[sighs]

33:15.333 --> 33:21.042
Look...you once offered to buy
me a drink, Garibaldi.

33:21.125 --> 33:24.000
If that offer still stands,
I think I could use one.

33:24.083 --> 33:26.542
Yeah, yeah, sure.

33:26.625 --> 33:28.250
I'll tell you what, I'll meet
you in the casino in 10 minutes.

33:28.333 --> 33:29.458
I gotta check
something out first.

33:29.542 --> 33:32.500
In the meantime,
just stay cool, alright?

33:33.917 --> 33:35.625
Alright?

33:35.708 --> 33:39.458
Okay. We can beat this
together. Somehow.

33:39.542 --> 33:41.833
(female #2)
Okay, I'll take care of it.

33:46.750 --> 33:48.583
These are difficult times,
Sinclair.

33:48.667 --> 33:52.250
Now you've ruffled some feathers
in command in the senate.

33:52.333 --> 33:53.583
Something like this
was bound to happen.

33:53.667 --> 33:56.333
You have the authority
to stop it.

33:56.417 --> 33:58.167
The president's Trade
and Immigration Act

33:58.250 --> 33:59.625
comes up for a vote soon,
he's gonna need

33:59.708 --> 34:01.667
all the support he can get.

34:01.750 --> 34:05.458
If I intervene in this matter,
it'll cost him dearly.

34:05.542 --> 34:06.750
What?

34:07.417 --> 34:08.792
Are you serious?

34:08.875 --> 34:12.208
These investigations have the
backing of powerful factions.

34:12.292 --> 34:14.625
Given the situation
on Mars and elsewhere

34:14.708 --> 34:16.667
we agreed to go along with them.

34:16.750 --> 34:18.792
We can't back out now.

34:18.875 --> 34:20.792
Look, we know you're doing a
good job out there

34:20.875 --> 34:22.583
'and I'm sure you'll be
completely exonerated'

34:22.667 --> 34:24.792
if any charge
is brought against you.

34:24.875 --> 34:29.000
And I promise
I'll do all I can to help

34:29.083 --> 34:31.250
when the time is right.

34:31.333 --> 34:32.833
Good luck, Jeff.

34:38.375 --> 34:40.083
- Come on, baby.
- Alright!

34:40.167 --> 34:41.625
[crowd cheering]

34:41.708 --> 34:44.458
Yeah! Three nebulas in a row.

34:44.542 --> 34:47.542
I am hot tonight. Pay up.

34:47.625 --> 34:50.042
Come on, I'll buy you a drink.

34:53.583 --> 34:57.083
Another one.
Hey, hey, careful.

34:57.167 --> 35:01.042
Ooh, I am hot.
Check out the cute commander.

35:02.917 --> 35:04.833
- Cute?
- Oh, yeah.

35:07.542 --> 35:09.250
(Sinclair)
'Garibaldi, you're early.'

35:09.333 --> 35:11.000
I picked up something
on the interweb.

35:11.083 --> 35:13.583
It looks like you and Ben Zayn
have something in common.

35:13.667 --> 35:15.167
- What?
- Well..

35:15.250 --> 35:17.208
You were both considered
for command of Babylon 5.

35:17.292 --> 35:19.250
Now he was in the top 10,
but you were..

35:19.333 --> 35:20.625
Yeah, well,
somewhere below that.

35:20.708 --> 35:24.292
Anyway, you also have
a mutual friend. Bester.

35:24.375 --> 35:25.667
The Psi Corps?

35:25.750 --> 35:27.708
He assigned Gray to Ben Zayn.

35:27.792 --> 35:29.250
He and the colonel are buddies.

35:29.333 --> 35:30.667
Remember Bester saying
he'd see you again

35:30.750 --> 35:32.333
after what happened
with Ironheart?

35:32.417 --> 35:34.208
'Yeah, well,
I smell a con job here.'

35:34.292 --> 35:37.250
I'd bet on it, Bester said I
hadn't heard the last of him

35:37.333 --> 35:39.792
'after his partner was killed
on Babylon 5.'

35:39.875 --> 35:42.417
Maybe the colonel
is his way of getting revenge.

35:42.500 --> 35:44.542
But what can I do about it?
This is all circumstantial.

35:44.625 --> 35:48.125
- It proves nothing unless--
- Garibaldi.

35:48.208 --> 35:50.333
(female #3)
'Chief, we have a big problem
in the casino.'

35:50.417 --> 35:52.958
- 'A big problem.'
- Ivanova.

35:53.042 --> 35:55.667
I forgot all about her.
I'm on my way.

36:03.917 --> 36:06.417
[groaning]

36:18.250 --> 36:19.500
Ivanova.

36:19.583 --> 36:21.000
Are you going to arrest me,
Garibaldi?

36:21.083 --> 36:24.083
No way, I wanna live
to see the future.

36:24.167 --> 36:25.833
I just wanna talk with you

36:25.917 --> 36:27.375
and reason with you

36:27.458 --> 36:30.208
recite a few choice passages
from my favorite reading.

36:30.292 --> 36:34.000
- For as long as it takes.
- You don't play fair.

36:34.083 --> 36:36.417
- Okay, I surrender.
- Alright. Oxy pill.

36:36.500 --> 36:37.708
This'll help you
pull yourself together.

36:37.792 --> 36:39.125
What? For my court-martial?

36:39.208 --> 36:42.042
Commander's last shot.
Clean up this trash.

36:53.875 --> 36:56.583
- Commander.
- Mr. Gray.

36:57.542 --> 36:59.458
I thought I'd find you here.

36:59.542 --> 37:02.458
Talia Winters says most
telepaths like to

37:02.542 --> 37:05.833
feel the acoustics of a room
before they perform a scan.

37:05.917 --> 37:07.625
The talent is a delicate thing.

37:07.708 --> 37:09.292
You'd be surprised
what may affect it.

37:09.375 --> 37:10.958
I imagine
you're very good at it.

37:11.042 --> 37:14.292
That's probably why Mr. Bester
assigned you to this job.

37:14.375 --> 37:16.792
You must be mistaken,
I don't know him

37:16.875 --> 37:18.208
at least not personally.

37:18.292 --> 37:23.083
Odd. He and the colonel
are very good friends.

37:23.167 --> 37:25.625
Maybe you're scanning
the wrong people.

37:29.667 --> 37:32.042
Harriman, take your place.

37:33.250 --> 37:35.333
Sinclair, if you please.

37:41.125 --> 37:42.750
All recorders on.

37:45.500 --> 37:48.875
Send in Lieutenant Commander
Ivanova and Mr. Garibaldi.

37:55.583 --> 37:57.875
This interview will cite
specific charges

37:57.958 --> 37:59.500
'against Mr. Sinclair'

37:59.583 --> 38:03.458
'and he and his staff will
submit to telepathic scan'

38:03.542 --> 38:08.500
to determine the validity
of these charges. Mr. Gray.

38:08.583 --> 38:09.958
I won't be scanning you deeply

38:10.042 --> 38:12.375
but only verifying your
responses to specific questions.

38:12.458 --> 38:14.375
It won't hurt unless
you try to resist it.

38:14.458 --> 38:16.083
Please relax,
answer truthfully

38:16.167 --> 38:18.667
and try to avoid strong emotion.

38:18.750 --> 38:20.833
Will you be scanning
the colonel as well?

38:20.917 --> 38:23.958
[chuckling]
Now, what're you playing at?

38:24.042 --> 38:26.458
You're the commander
of Babylon 5 now.

38:26.542 --> 38:29.875
The regulation says all involved
parties on staff may be scanned.

38:29.958 --> 38:32.208
And you're involved, colonel,
up to your neck.

38:32.292 --> 38:34.917
That will be all, mister.

38:35.000 --> 38:36.417
You're here to answer questions.

38:36.500 --> 38:38.500
The intent of a question
is sometimes as important

38:38.583 --> 38:40.875
as the answer, for instance

38:40.958 --> 38:42.875
if I were to ask you
why you turned a routine

38:42.958 --> 38:45.583
investigation into a personal
hunt for my scalp..

38:45.667 --> 38:47.250
You flatter yourself, Sinclair.

38:47.333 --> 38:49.292
Do I?
It must've stuck in your craw

38:49.375 --> 38:52.542
when you were passed over
for command of Babylon 5.

38:52.625 --> 38:54.417
'Passed over
for a "hotshot without'

38:54.500 --> 38:55.917
'any real leadership ability."'

38:56.042 --> 38:57.458
Sinclair, I'm warning you.

38:57.542 --> 38:58.750
There was nothing
you could do, of course.

38:58.833 --> 39:00.333
Until your friend Bester
thought of a way

39:00.417 --> 39:02.250
to get even for you
and for himself.

39:02.333 --> 39:04.917
- You're insane.
- Maybe I am.

39:05.000 --> 39:06.417
Maybe it's crazy
to think that Earthforce

39:06.500 --> 39:08.958
still respects honor,
freedom and human dignity

39:09.042 --> 39:10.417
when a maggot like you can spit

39:10.500 --> 39:13.292
on some of the best officers
I've ever served.

39:13.375 --> 39:15.042
'All for the sake
of your own ambition.'

39:15.125 --> 39:19.375
By God, man, I'll have you
before execution squad for this.

39:19.458 --> 39:21.750
I faced death on the Line.

39:21.833 --> 39:23.625
Where were you, colonel?

39:23.708 --> 39:25.583
Picking trash
out of garbage cans

39:25.667 --> 39:29.250
to prove who was loyal
and who wasn't?

39:29.333 --> 39:32.375
I got this leading people

39:32.458 --> 39:34.583
into battle, Sinclair.

39:34.667 --> 39:40.333
In Israel, on New Jerusalem,
Cyrus 3 and a hundred more.

39:40.417 --> 39:42.750
I saw more death than you could
ever conceive of

39:42.833 --> 39:47.292
but I won my battles
and I deserved this command.

39:47.375 --> 39:49.792
I deserved it!

39:49.875 --> 39:52.458
But thanks to those
damn Minbari, you got it!

39:52.542 --> 39:56.208
Yes, I know all about you
and the Minbari.

39:56.292 --> 39:58.333
But you won't be doing
their bidding much longer.

39:58.417 --> 40:01.333
I'm commander of Babylon 5 now!

40:01.417 --> 40:05.708
And all your lies
won't change that.

40:05.792 --> 40:08.000
(Harriman)
'It's you who's lying, colonel.'

40:08.083 --> 40:11.958
I can feel the hatred in you.
It's sick, deep, filthy.

40:12.042 --> 40:14.417
You're in my mind, you little..

40:14.500 --> 40:16.000
[groans]

40:16.083 --> 40:18.917
- Stay where you are!
- Colonel, it's over.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.292
It's over for you, Sinclair.

40:20.375 --> 40:22.333
You and these misfits
you call soldiers

40:22.417 --> 40:24.333
'I'll have you all up
before a tribunal.'

40:24.417 --> 40:27.125
- Go ahead, captain.
- He can't get all of us.

40:27.208 --> 40:31.542
Famous last words
from a trio of mutineers.

40:31.625 --> 40:34.167
Colonel. Pain.

40:35.500 --> 40:36.750
[grunts]

40:41.458 --> 40:43.750
I assume the investigation
is concluded?

40:43.833 --> 40:45.042
Hm.

40:48.500 --> 40:51.542
[dramatic music]

41:01.458 --> 41:02.958
Behold..

41:03.958 --> 41:07.708
...the Ninja ZX-11.

41:14.292 --> 41:18.375
- What've you done?
- You are not pleased?

41:18.458 --> 41:21.708
I said you could work on it
a little, not finish it.

41:21.792 --> 41:25.958
- I do not understand.
- I wanted to build it myself.

41:26.042 --> 41:27.958
It was kind of a purpose
in my life.

41:28.042 --> 41:29.375
Now it's..

41:30.833 --> 41:31.958
...done.

41:32.042 --> 41:34.333
I have made a grievous error.

41:35.625 --> 41:37.875
Please forgive me.

41:37.958 --> 41:39.500
Uh, never mind.

41:41.458 --> 41:43.292
You did a beautiful job.

41:44.583 --> 41:46.625
It's great, isn't it? Huh?

41:46.708 --> 41:50.167
- It's too bad we can't ride it.
- Oh, it's quite rideable.

41:50.250 --> 41:52.333
Don't tell me you came up
with some gas too?

41:52.417 --> 41:54.583
Gasoline is harmful to both
living beings

41:54.667 --> 41:57.375
and the atmosphere
as your people discovered.

41:57.458 --> 42:00.833
I have installed a Minbari
power source instead.

42:00.917 --> 42:02.833
Clean and efficient.

42:04.125 --> 42:07.417
- Get out of here.
- Yes, of course.

42:07.500 --> 42:10.625
No, no, no, wait, wait, wait.
I didn't mean go, I meant..

42:10.708 --> 42:13.833
Never mind.
Give me a hand with this, huh?

42:19.792 --> 42:22.417
I never thought I'd be grateful
to a member of Psi Corps.

42:22.500 --> 42:25.000
I hope this affair doesn't
turn out badly for Mr. Gray.

42:25.083 --> 42:26.958
He'll be alright,
the record clearly shows

42:27.042 --> 42:29.583
the colonel overstepped his
bounds and a psychiatric scan

42:29.667 --> 42:31.833
should confirm
his mental state is unstable.

42:31.917 --> 42:33.333
And Mr. Bester?

42:33.417 --> 42:35.917
Mr. Bester is not the type to
come too far out of the shadows.

42:36.000 --> 42:39.167
And there are bound to be some
questions raised over this.

42:41.417 --> 42:44.458
[engine revving]

42:47.625 --> 42:50.000
It's good to have things
back to normal.

42:51.917 --> 42:53.792
[engine revving]

42:59.875 --> 43:02.833
[theme music]
