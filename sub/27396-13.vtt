more than he wanted to

00:18.333 --> 00:19.250
-at parties, right?
-Here we go again.

00:19.333 --> 00:20.375
-This is so not true.
-GORDON: No, n-n-no.

00:20.458 --> 00:22.709
-This is absolutely true. What?
-No, we both drank a lot.

00:22.792 --> 00:24.041
-Yeah, but you always
came in first.
-We both drank a lot,

-It's not.
The waiter would come by

and say,
"Do you want another round?"

00:29.125 --> 00:31.208
-Absolute lie.

-Almost.

01:34.625 --> 01:36.875
Well, I can see how a guy
being excited to see you

01:36.959 --> 01:38.291
would be a major turn-off.

five years younger,

01:39.834 --> 01:41.166

too much fun with you.

Eventually, it could be used

08:21.834 --> 08:23.750
a new timeline was generated.

08:46.625 --> 08:48.750
were you thinking about
when the wave hit?

08:48.834 --> 08:51.750
Well... last night,

08:51.834 --> 08:53.750

about our first date.

08:53.834 --> 08:56.542

08:56.625 --> 08:57.709
That was yesterday.

08:57.792 --> 08:59.166
We went out yesterday.

08:59.250 --> 09:02.000
So you're saying
Kelly's thoughts did this?

09:02.083 --> 09:03.667
JOHN:
I know it sounds crazy,

09:03.750 --> 09:05.166
but that's quantum physics.

09:05.250 --> 09:06.625
Even on Kaylon,

09:06.709 --> 09:08.750

of a conscious observer

09:08.834 --> 09:10.667
to quantum-level events
in time and space

09:10.750 --> 09:12.333
is not fully understood.

09:12.417 --> 09:14.625
It was part of the subject
of my research.

09:15.709 --> 09:17.333
I need a drink.

09:17.417 --> 09:20.208
Me, too.

09:25.250 --> 09:27.750
I don't know how the food
synthesizers are gonna

09:27.834 --> 09:31.417

for two Kellys.

09:31.500 --> 09:33.625
I got a B-plus
in temporal theory.

09:33.709 --> 09:36.333
I would have thought you, of all
people, would've gotten an "A."

09:36.417 --> 09:37.792
Well, nobody gets an "A."

09:37.875 --> 09:39.792
It's time travel,
nobody really understands it.

09:39.875 --> 09:42.000
But... I do have one question.

09:42.083 --> 09:45.291
What do we tell her
about the past seven years?

09:45.375 --> 09:47.000
What do you think?

09:47.083 --> 09:49.500
Well, if we're dealing
with a tangent timeline

09:49.583 --> 09:51.375
and we are able
to send her back,

09:51.458 --> 09:52.875
then nothing she knows
will matter.

09:52.959 --> 09:54.792
But if it's a single timeline,

09:54.875 --> 09:56.625
then we should
lock her in a room

09:56.709 --> 09:59.000
and keep her away from any
information about the future.

09:59.083 --> 10:00.792
How do we know which one it is?

10:00.875 --> 10:02.834
We don't.

10:02.917 --> 10:04.667
And I'm not gonna

10:04.750 --> 10:06.750
confine her to quarters
when she's done nothing wrong.

10:06.834 --> 10:09.250
So, my philosophy is

10:09.333 --> 10:12.583
when in doubt... tell the truth.

10:14.917 --> 10:18.834
You have to forgive me, this is
just a whole lot to process.

10:18.917 --> 10:21.834
-We got married?
-BOTH: Yes.

10:21.917 --> 10:25.291
-And then we got divorced.
-That's right.

10:25.375 --> 10:27.792
And now we're serving together

10:27.875 --> 10:29.667
as captain and first officer

10:29.750 --> 10:30.792
on the same ship?

10:30.875 --> 10:31.959
That's correct.

10:33.625 --> 10:35.250
I... I mean...

10:35.333 --> 10:37.542
if you'd asked me to predict
the next seven years of my life,

10:37.625 --> 10:40.041
this-this would have been
guess number 9,000.

10:40.125 --> 10:41.917
Are you okay?

10:43.000 --> 10:45.709
Um... yes.

10:45.792 --> 10:47.917
No. I...

10:48.000 --> 10:51.208
I seriously have no idea
what to think right now.

10:51.291 --> 10:53.667
What, um... I mean...

10:53.750 --> 10:55.875
why did we get divorced?

10:55.959 --> 10:57.125
-That's a...
-Well, it's...

10:57.208 --> 10:59.834
-...multifaceted situation.
-...a little complicated.

10:59.917 --> 11:02.333
I was commuting to Epsilon
Eridani for work every day.

11:02.417 --> 11:04.291
-And I was on Earth.
-And I was working a lot.

11:04.375 --> 11:06.417
-He had trouble with balance.
-A lot of trouble, actually.

11:06.500 --> 11:08.750
-I felt very alone.
-And one night,
after months of this...

11:08.834 --> 11:10.834
-It was really bad.
-...it was a...

11:10.917 --> 11:13.917
-There was an... infidelity.
-Hmm.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.542
Wait... who cheated on who?

11:16.625 --> 11:18.875
-Well, I wouldn't say
"cheated," exactly.
-Uh, that's kind of a

11:18.959 --> 11:21.083
-textured thing, it's not...
-Because we later found out

11:21.166 --> 11:22.750
-the Retepsian was in heat.
-Mm-hmm.

11:22.834 --> 11:24.917
Okay, I'm very confused.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.792
You know what?

11:26.875 --> 11:28.291
I have a better idea.

11:28.375 --> 11:30.333
You're probably exhausted.

11:30.417 --> 11:32.333
I remember being pretty hungover
that morning.

11:32.417 --> 11:33.875
So...

11:33.959 --> 11:35.834
how about I give you access
to my personal logs

11:35.917 --> 11:37.709
and you can get caught up?

11:37.792 --> 11:41.291
I mean, you are me, anyway.

11:46.750 --> 11:48.792
Must all be
pretty overwhelming, huh?

11:48.875 --> 11:51.125
I just...

11:51.208 --> 11:53.417
I feel like my whole life
has already happened

11:53.500 --> 11:54.750
and I didn't even have
any say in it.

11:54.834 --> 11:57.000
I feel like that sometimes,

11:57.083 --> 11:59.083
and I haven't even
traveled through time.

11:59.166 --> 12:00.875
Maybe it'd help
to just block out

12:00.959 --> 12:02.834
what everyone tells you
about you.

12:02.917 --> 12:05.667
These are your quarters
for the time being.

12:16.875 --> 12:18.166
I'm pretty new here, too.

12:18.250 --> 12:20.208
So, if you ever need someone
to talk to,

12:20.291 --> 12:21.792
I'm always around.

12:21.875 --> 12:23.667
Thanks.

12:38.834 --> 12:40.333
Hey, you know,
I just had a thought.

12:40.417 --> 12:43.917
If Young Kelly meeting Old Kelly
has changed the timeline,

12:44.000 --> 12:45.917
would we even know about it?

12:46.000 --> 12:48.583
How about we say
"Past" and "Present" Kelly?

12:48.667 --> 12:51.250
Perhaps the timeline
has already been changed.

12:51.333 --> 12:53.917
Yeah, I mean, it would just be
like what we already know.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.542
You guys will not get me
into a discussion

12:55.625 --> 12:57.000
of time-travel logic.

12:57.083 --> 12:58.542
I would rather chew
broken glass.

12:58.625 --> 12:59.834
Captain.

12:59.917 --> 13:02.792
Lamarr. Please tell us
you have something.

13:02.875 --> 13:05.792
We have been analyzing the scans
of the gravitational wave

13:05.875 --> 13:08.333
and its effect
on the Aronov device.

13:08.417 --> 13:11.000
As the gravitational pulse
was a natural phenomenon,

13:11.083 --> 13:13.041
there is an irreducible
chaotic element.

13:13.125 --> 13:14.917
It's too random to lock into.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.834
If we had seen it coming, we
could have targeted our scans,

13:17.917 --> 13:20.208
but as of right now,
there's no way to duplicate it.

13:20.291 --> 13:23.500
Which means there's no way
to send Kelly back.

13:35.959 --> 13:38.667
Isn't there anything at all
they can do?

13:38.750 --> 13:40.875
I mean, we have
a supposedly brilliant engineer

13:40.959 --> 13:43.083
and a Kaylon working on this.

13:43.166 --> 13:45.208
I'm really stuck here?

13:45.291 --> 13:48.458
I wish we had better news.
I'm sorry.

13:48.542 --> 13:51.583
What about my friends?
M-My family?

13:51.667 --> 13:53.041
Most of them are still on Earth.

13:53.125 --> 13:55.959
Oh, come on.
Those are your friends now.

13:56.041 --> 13:57.208
Even Mom wouldn't understand.

13:57.291 --> 13:58.959
This is-this is your world,
not mine.

14:00.917 --> 14:02.959
I know it's really hard.

14:03.041 --> 14:05.041
But you can take all the time
you need to decide

14:05.125 --> 14:07.041
what you want
your life here to be.

14:07.125 --> 14:09.542
Seems clear by now,
for whatever reason,

14:09.625 --> 14:11.500
the timeline is intact.

14:11.583 --> 14:13.709
Nothing you do
will affect the future.

14:13.792 --> 14:16.208
Wow.

14:16.291 --> 14:18.875
What a great thing
to hear about yourself.

14:18.959 --> 14:19.917
I didn't...

14:21.000 --> 14:22.917
You know what I meant.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.667
Look, you have lots of options.

14:25.750 --> 14:28.458
You could go back to Earth,
choose your own Union posting.

14:28.542 --> 14:30.458
We would help you
in any way we can,

14:30.542 --> 14:32.500
and I'm sure Admiral Halsey
would do the same.

14:34.125 --> 14:37.000
I just, um...

14:37.083 --> 14:39.834
I need to think.

14:52.667 --> 14:54.291
(door chimes)

14:55.959 --> 14:57.166
Come in.

14:59.250 --> 15:01.125
Hey.

15:01.208 --> 15:03.542
Just figured I'd check up
on you, see how you're doing.

15:03.625 --> 15:06.583
A little better, I guess.

15:06.667 --> 15:09.750
I just still can't process it.

15:09.834 --> 15:13.000
I mean, who am I here?

15:13.083 --> 15:15.583
I have no place.

15:15.667 --> 15:17.542
What am I supposed to do?

15:17.625 --> 15:20.917
I know it seems impossible,
but you're gonna be fine.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.375
How?

15:22.458 --> 15:25.333
Well...

15:25.417 --> 15:27.500
what are your goals in life?

15:27.583 --> 15:30.083
To fall in love.

15:30.166 --> 15:33.875
To be captain of my own ship.

15:35.166 --> 15:37.166
To help make the galaxy
a better place.

15:37.250 --> 15:40.041
And you can still do every
single one of those things.

15:40.125 --> 15:41.792
None of who you are has changed.

15:41.875 --> 15:44.417
What's the point when
she's gonna do it all first?

15:44.500 --> 15:47.041
And if she fails, then I know
there's no point in even trying.

15:47.125 --> 15:50.041
Look, time travel
is messed up, I know.

15:50.125 --> 15:53.792
But as crazy as it seems,
you are now two separate people.

15:53.875 --> 15:56.709
And you have to start
seeing it that way.

15:56.792 --> 15:59.250
She has her life,
and you have yours.

15:59.333 --> 16:02.625
And yours can be anything
you want it to be.

16:02.709 --> 16:04.458
And, selfishly...

16:04.542 --> 16:06.917
I like that I have a new friend.

16:09.041 --> 16:11.834
Now, as long as you're here,
what do you say we get you

16:11.917 --> 16:13.667
a proper uniform, Lieutenant?

16:20.875 --> 16:22.667
(all laughing)

16:22.750 --> 16:24.667
JOHN:
I don't think so.

16:24.750 --> 16:26.834
Man, this girl can really
soak it up.

16:26.917 --> 16:28.208
Oh, please, this is nothing.

16:28.291 --> 16:30.208
At Union Point
I used to drink all night

16:30.291 --> 16:31.667
and then report for duty
the next morning.

16:31.750 --> 16:34.333
-What?
-This one time, I was
still tipsy when we were

16:34.417 --> 16:36.166
breaking gravity on Rhealon IV.

16:36.250 --> 16:39.000
(chuckling):
I wasn't buckled in,

16:39.083 --> 16:40.709
and I went sliding down
the corridor like a luge.

16:40.792 --> 16:42.250
(laughing)

16:42.333 --> 16:44.083
It was actually really fun.

16:44.166 --> 16:46.208
So the next day, I convinced
all the other cadets

16:46.291 --> 16:48.375
to strip down and grease up.

16:48.458 --> 16:50.083
And when the ship broke gravity,

16:50.166 --> 16:51.417
we all went through
the main conduit

16:51.500 --> 16:52.709
like it was a Slip 'N Slide.

16:52.792 --> 16:54.208
(laughter)

16:54.291 --> 16:55.792
Which would have been hilarious

16:55.875 --> 16:57.875
if I had not slid
right into my commanding officer

16:57.959 --> 16:59.083
in my underwear.

16:59.166 --> 17:01.792
(laughing):
Oh, my God, what did you do?

17:01.875 --> 17:03.041
Let me tell you something,

17:03.125 --> 17:05.041
nobody cleans a toilet
better than me.

17:05.125 --> 17:06.959
(laughing)

17:08.333 --> 17:09.625
Lieutenant Grayson.

17:10.875 --> 17:12.041
Can I have a word?

17:12.125 --> 17:13.875
Of course, Commander.

17:21.583 --> 17:23.125
Lieutenant,
there are certain things

17:23.208 --> 17:26.125
I'd really like to keep private
on this ship.

17:26.208 --> 17:27.917
Like that story.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.542
Oh. I'm sorry.

17:30.625 --> 17:32.625
I didn't think
it was that big of a deal.

17:32.709 --> 17:34.166
It was funny.

17:34.250 --> 17:37.333
I remember, and I understand
that memory is

17:37.417 --> 17:39.250
as much yours as it is mine.

17:39.333 --> 17:42.166
But the people you're telling
are my crew.

17:42.250 --> 17:45.250
They're under my command,
and for things to work properly

17:45.333 --> 17:47.667
on this ship,
they need to respect me.

17:47.750 --> 17:50.291
I get it. I was...

17:50.375 --> 17:52.166
just trying
to make friends here.

17:52.250 --> 17:53.959
But you're right,
I wasn't thinking.

17:54.041 --> 17:56.291
I learned this
over a long seven years.

17:56.375 --> 17:58.166
When you become a leader,
there's a distance

17:58.250 --> 17:59.875
you have to maintain.

17:59.959 --> 18:01.208
You can't be everyone's friend.

18:01.291 --> 18:04.291
Yeah, but I'm not a leader yet.

18:04.375 --> 18:07.166
And, honestly, the idea
of policing everything I do

18:07.250 --> 18:09.917
so it doesn't affect
your command is...

18:10.000 --> 18:11.583
well, kind of suffocating.

18:11.667 --> 18:13.458
All the baggage
without the rank.

18:13.542 --> 18:15.208
I know, it sucks.

18:15.291 --> 18:16.792
But here's the upside.

18:16.875 --> 18:19.000
We each have
the ultimate confidant.

18:19.083 --> 18:22.875
Someone who knows all of our
secrets, our hopes, fears.

18:22.959 --> 18:25.000
We can tell each other anything.

18:25.083 --> 18:27.166
Like a twin sister.

18:27.250 --> 18:29.041
Why not?

18:31.041 --> 18:33.500
There is something
I don't know, actually.

18:33.583 --> 18:34.667
What's that?

18:34.750 --> 18:36.291
Is it really over...

18:36.375 --> 18:37.792
with you and Ed?

18:37.875 --> 18:41.542
It is.
We've both moved on.

18:41.625 --> 18:43.041
Oh.

18:44.208 --> 18:46.542
So, have you thought at all
about what you want to do?

18:46.625 --> 18:50.375
Well... I love what I've seen
of this ship so far.

18:50.458 --> 18:54.208
And Talla's really cool,
so is the rest of the crew.

18:54.291 --> 18:56.542
So I was thinking...

18:56.625 --> 18:59.083
what if I requested a posting
on the<i> Orville? </i>

19:00.250 --> 19:01.750
Really?

19:01.834 --> 19:03.583
I mean, it's the closest thing
I have to a home in this world.

19:03.667 --> 19:05.291
At least for now.

19:05.375 --> 19:08.291
I mean, it-it could be
really great, right?

19:08.375 --> 19:11.208
Yeah. I-I guess it could be.

19:11.291 --> 19:13.083
So, what do you say, Commander?

19:16.417 --> 19:18.875
Call me Kelly.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.417
You too.

19:24.125 --> 19:26.792
<i>(grunting)</i>

19:26.875 --> 19:29.458
-Oh, come on.
How are you doing that?
-Got to hit the left arrow,

19:29.542 --> 19:31.291
-hold the top button down.
-That's what I'm doing.

19:31.375 --> 19:33.208
I'm literally doing what you
just said. Look, see?

19:33.291 --> 19:35.291
-You got to hold

-Gordon, look at my hand.

19:35.375 --> 19:37.041
-I'm pressing the top button.
-Yeah, but you're not tapping
the left arrow.

19:37.125 --> 19:38.583
Oh, my God, this is so stupid.

19:38.667 --> 19:39.792
Wait, hang on.

19:39.875 --> 19:41.208
Wait, where's he...?

19:41.291 --> 19:42.875
-Wait, how am I supposed to...?
-You got to back him up.

19:42.959 --> 19:45.041
-How do I back him up?
-Press the top left button,

19:45.125 --> 19:46.875

tap the "X" button.

19:46.959 --> 19:48.375
Gordon, I don't have 20 fingers.

-This is...

19:49.458 --> 19:50.375
Come in.

20:04.375 --> 20:06.417
-What's up?
-Well,

20:06.500 --> 20:09.291
I was wondering
if I could talk to you.

20:09.375 --> 20:10.291
Alone?

20:10.375 --> 20:14.000
Oh. Ah. It's all good.
I got to go. Good game.

20:14.083 --> 20:15.250
Yeah, good game.

20:16.333 --> 20:19.000
So, what's going on?
How you settling in?

20:19.083 --> 20:20.500
Not bad, considering.

20:20.583 --> 20:22.291
Everyone's been really amazing.

20:22.375 --> 20:25.291
I feel very... looked after.

20:25.375 --> 20:28.083
-Well, it's a good crew.
-Yeah.

20:28.166 --> 20:31.208
Listen...
this is a weird situation,

20:31.291 --> 20:33.166
so I'm just gonna come
right out and say it.

20:34.542 --> 20:36.834
I had a really great time
with you the other night.

20:36.917 --> 20:38.250
The other night?

20:40.083 --> 20:41.917
Oh, yeah, yeah.
<i>Your </i>other night.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.417
-Yeah,<i> my </i>other night.
-Yeah, yeah, right.

20:43.500 --> 20:46.875
Which, for me,
is still fresh in my mind.

20:46.959 --> 20:50.875
So, I guess what I was
wondering is, um...

20:54.583 --> 20:56.250
I would love a second date.

21:05.375 --> 21:07.583
(door whooshes open)

21:08.709 --> 21:09.875
Knock, knock.

21:09.959 --> 21:11.458
Hey.

21:11.542 --> 21:15.291
Listen, I have
kind of a weird question.

21:15.375 --> 21:17.458
What's up?

21:17.542 --> 21:19.542
Well, it's-it's really weird.

21:19.625 --> 21:21.291
Like, um...

21:21.375 --> 21:23.458
like, you might
get riled up weird.

21:23.542 --> 21:24.333
What is it?

21:26.000 --> 21:28.041
You remember when you were
dating Cassius,

21:28.125 --> 21:30.333
and I supported you guys,

21:30.417 --> 21:32.125
and I was totally cool about it?

21:32.208 --> 21:33.542
Eventually, yes.

21:33.625 --> 21:35.792
And you still feel that
we should not get back together

21:35.875 --> 21:39.500
because our jobs make it
too complicated.

21:39.583 --> 21:41.208
Where are you going with this?

21:41.291 --> 21:43.125
How would you feel...

21:43.208 --> 21:45.792
about me going on a second date?

21:47.375 --> 21:48.417
With her.

21:50.625 --> 21:52.417
Look, I know it's out there, but

21:52.500 --> 21:54.917
she came to my quarters, and...

21:55.000 --> 21:56.667
I didn't know what to say.

21:56.750 --> 21:59.417
All I knew was that
I didn't want to say no.

21:59.500 --> 22:02.000
And you're equating this
with Cassius.

22:02.083 --> 22:03.875
Well, yeah, you found someone
and so did I.

22:03.959 --> 22:05.333
Yeah, it's a little different.

22:05.417 --> 22:07.375
Think of it this way.

22:07.458 --> 22:10.709
It's almost like it could be
a second chance for us.

22:10.792 --> 22:14.375
There is no "us" without me.
She's not me.

22:14.458 --> 22:17.917
I know, but... she was.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.125
And truthfully, I'd really
just like to date somebody

22:20.208 --> 22:21.417
who's not a Krill.

22:21.500 --> 22:23.291
S-So you just...

22:24.792 --> 22:26.041
...want to start over?

22:26.125 --> 22:28.542
How many times have
human beings wished

22:28.625 --> 22:30.375
that they could go back
and fix the past?

22:30.458 --> 22:33.834
Well, this is
a real-life opportunity.

22:33.917 --> 22:36.583
My job consumed me
when we were together,

22:36.667 --> 22:38.458
and I drove you
right out of my life.

22:38.542 --> 22:40.291
I have regretted that
ever since.

22:41.792 --> 22:44.291
I'm just saying all I want
is a chance to fix it.

22:46.458 --> 22:48.166
But that's why
I came here first.

22:48.250 --> 22:50.125
All you have to say

22:50.208 --> 22:52.417
is that you want
to try again with me,

22:52.500 --> 22:54.875
and I won't even consider this.

22:56.709 --> 22:58.333
You know I can't.

23:03.125 --> 23:04.458
Look...

23:04.542 --> 23:07.250
I have no right
to tell you not to pursue this.

23:07.333 --> 23:10.083
But just remember, seven years
have passed for you, too.

23:10.166 --> 23:12.458
You've changed, just like me.

23:12.542 --> 23:14.458
And you may find it harder

23:14.542 --> 23:17.041
to get along with young me
than you think.

23:17.125 --> 23:19.083
Well, I'll be careful.

23:20.166 --> 23:22.875
And... thanks.

23:37.959 --> 23:39.875
-(indistinct chatter)
-(mellow piano music playing)

23:39.959 --> 23:43.834
Wait, so you're telling me Isaac
turned against his own people

23:43.917 --> 23:45.500
-to save the Union?
-Yeah.

23:45.583 --> 23:47.875
No one knew what to do
with him after that.

23:47.959 --> 23:49.542
The admirals wanted
to deactivate him,

23:49.625 --> 23:51.417
but Kelly and I talked 'em
out of it.

23:51.500 --> 23:53.667
"Kelly and I."

23:53.750 --> 23:55.792
God, I'm sorry,
I keep doing that...

23:55.875 --> 23:57.458
No, it's-it's okay.

23:57.542 --> 23:59.834
I know this is just as trippy
for you.

23:59.917 --> 24:01.667
Yeah, well,
I kind of doubt that,

24:01.750 --> 24:03.041
but I'm doing my best.
(chuckles)

24:03.125 --> 24:06.000
So...

24:06.083 --> 24:07.500
when'd you call me?

24:07.583 --> 24:10.083
-Hmm?
-After our first date.

24:10.166 --> 24:11.917
You obviously called me
and asked me out again.

24:12.000 --> 24:15.208
Oh, um... yeah, I think it was,
like, two, three days later?

24:15.291 --> 24:17.000
-Something like that.
-Really?

24:17.083 --> 24:18.417
-Yeah.
-Hmm.

24:19.834 --> 24:21.542
I don't know if I buy that.

24:21.625 --> 24:23.959
-Why not?
-I don't know, you just

24:24.041 --> 24:26.458
didn't seem like
you had that much game.

24:26.542 --> 24:29.709
If I had to guess, I would say
it was, like, the next day.

24:29.792 --> 24:32.250
-Well, that's...
-And probably before noon.

24:32.333 --> 24:33.542
Okay, well,
there's no advantage to me

24:33.625 --> 24:35.458
being in the future
if I can't use it against you.

24:35.542 --> 24:36.709
(both chuckle)

24:36.792 --> 24:37.875
Can I bring you two
another round?

24:37.959 --> 24:39.250
-Oh, no, I'm fine. I'm good.
-Oh, absolutely.

24:39.333 --> 24:40.500
-I've had plenty.
-No. We need, we need two more.

24:40.583 --> 24:41.959
-I'm-I'm okay.
-Another round.

24:42.041 --> 24:43.291
-I've had three of these.
-He-he-he needs another one.

24:43.375 --> 24:44.083
-I'm fine. I really don't.
-He needs another one.

24:44.166 --> 24:46.041
-I'm fine.
-He has to have one.
-The lady wins--

24:46.125 --> 24:47.250
I'll bring you another round.

24:47.333 --> 24:49.542
-Thank you.
-WAITER: Yeah.
-Okay.

24:49.625 --> 24:51.458
-Déjà vu.
-(chuckles)

24:53.709 --> 24:55.125
(both laughing)

24:55.208 --> 24:57.041
This-this is your fault,
you realize that?

24:57.125 --> 24:59.542
-Oh, no, no, no, no,
I take no responsibility.
-This is all your fault.

24:59.625 --> 25:02.291
-I-I have to maintain a decorum
in front of the crew.
-No, I just ordered the drinks.

25:02.375 --> 25:04.583
-You drank them.
-I can't... Four drinks
is too many for me.

25:04.667 --> 25:06.750
-This is all on you,
buddy, man, this...
-This... we're here,

25:06.834 --> 25:08.375
-by the way, we're here.
-Oh, we're here?

25:08.458 --> 25:09.750
-Yeah.
-(both laugh)

25:09.834 --> 25:11.709
-Um...
-Well...

25:11.792 --> 25:14.083
I, uh...

25:14.166 --> 25:17.291
I had a really
great time, again.

25:17.375 --> 25:18.542
So did I.

25:18.625 --> 25:21.083
Again.

25:21.166 --> 25:24.583
Which, in my case, is a little
more of a loaded statement.

25:24.667 --> 25:26.417
Everything you said
after the third drink

25:26.500 --> 25:27.542
was a loaded statement, so...

25:27.625 --> 25:29.500
Oh, wow, that was a dad joke.

25:29.583 --> 25:31.500
-(laughs) Oh...
-Y-You just made a dad joke.

25:31.583 --> 25:33.291
-What... Wh-Who are you?
-You want to kiss
your dad good night?

25:33.375 --> 25:35.917
(laughing): Wow. This is,
this is so not romantic at all.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.917
You know it is.
Come here. Come here.

25:49.500 --> 25:52.792
-Good night.
-Good night.

26:05.250 --> 26:08.250
-Captain.
-Lieutenant.

26:19.041 --> 26:21.500
-(door chimes)
-Come in.

26:24.083 --> 26:25.625
Hey. Good morning.

26:25.709 --> 26:29.166
Hi. Listen...

26:29.250 --> 26:31.083
I need to talk to you
about something.

26:31.166 --> 26:32.125
What's up?

26:33.875 --> 26:37.417
I'm having real reservations
about this whole thing

26:37.500 --> 26:38.667
with you and Ed.

26:38.750 --> 26:40.583
You are?

26:40.667 --> 26:42.834
I don't think it's a good idea.

26:42.917 --> 26:46.375
Well... I just figured since
you aren't together anymore...

26:46.458 --> 26:48.792
That's my point, actually.

26:48.875 --> 26:50.792
You didn't experience it,

26:50.875 --> 26:53.500
but he was pretty devastated
when it ended.

26:53.583 --> 26:55.041
So was I.

26:55.125 --> 26:57.041
And I just...

26:57.125 --> 26:59.041
I know me at your age.

26:59.125 --> 27:00.792
I don't want
to see him get hurt.

27:00.875 --> 27:03.250
I don't want
to see<i> you </i>get hurt.

27:03.333 --> 27:04.667
I know how this turns out.

27:04.750 --> 27:08.041
Well, I don't plan
to let it turn out that way.

27:08.125 --> 27:10.792
-I didn't plan to, either.
-But you did.

27:10.875 --> 27:14.625
Yeah. That's what
I'm warning you about.

27:14.709 --> 27:17.542
With all due respect, Commander,
I don't need warnings.

27:17.625 --> 27:20.417
I'm not you.
I mean what I say.

27:20.500 --> 27:22.041
And if this really is
a new timeline,

27:22.125 --> 27:24.083
how do you know I haven't found
my soul mate?

27:24.166 --> 27:27.750
Who are we kidding?
You are me.

27:27.834 --> 27:28.917
Just a younger, more naive me.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.625
I mean, I know myself.

27:30.709 --> 27:32.417
I used to say things
like "find my soul mate."

27:32.500 --> 27:33.667
Well, guess what.

27:33.750 --> 27:36.208
You don't find soul mates,
you become soul mates

27:36.291 --> 27:37.792
by growing together.

27:37.875 --> 27:40.333
And if you'd been through
this marriage like I have,

27:40.417 --> 27:41.667
you'd be wise enough
to know that.

27:41.750 --> 27:43.500
So you're saying
you have a better handle

27:43.583 --> 27:45.041
on our life than I do?

27:45.125 --> 27:47.333
Have you seen the hot mess
you've made of it?

27:47.417 --> 27:49.875
You know what? Forget it. I have
to get back to the bridge.

27:49.959 --> 27:51.500
Wait. Just hang on
and listen to me because

27:51.583 --> 27:53.083
-I have something to say.
-If you want to make
a massive mistake, fine.

27:53.166 --> 27:54.917
And I know you don't want
to hear it, but you have to.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.125
What?

27:56.208 --> 27:58.458
You're not married.

27:58.542 --> 27:59.875
You're not a captain.

27:59.959 --> 28:01.917
You "maintain a distance"
from your crew.

28:02.000 --> 28:05.875
There were three things
I wanted in life,

28:05.959 --> 28:07.667
and you haven't
come close on one.

28:10.625 --> 28:12.917
You've made my future
a disappointment.

28:40.792 --> 28:41.959
Everything okay?

28:42.041 --> 28:44.709
It's fine.

28:44.792 --> 28:46.792
Okay.

28:47.792 --> 28:50.208
(monitor beeps)

28:50.291 --> 28:52.959
Captain, scans have picked up
two Kaylon ships

28:53.041 --> 28:55.083
on what appears to be
an intercept course.

28:55.166 --> 28:57.917
-Have they seen us?
-Unable to confirm.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.083
Better safe than sorry.

29:00.166 --> 29:02.083
Gordon, alter course
and go to quantum.

29:02.166 --> 29:03.583
Aye, sir.

29:09.291 --> 29:11.959
The Kaylon are not pursuing.

29:12.041 --> 29:13.709
That was close.

29:15.125 --> 29:17.375
Maintain course until we're
out of scanning range.

29:23.458 --> 29:25.542
You know, Gordon,
I got to tell you,

29:25.625 --> 29:29.125
I feel like I have a real chance
at making things right.

29:29.208 --> 29:30.875
-With Kelly?
-Yeah.

29:30.959 --> 29:32.834
I mean, it's like
all of the excitement

29:32.917 --> 29:34.333
of the first time around,

29:34.417 --> 29:36.333
but with all the wrinkles
ironed out, you know?

29:36.417 --> 29:39.000
Look, dude, I'm gonna be
honest with you.

29:39.083 --> 29:40.041
I think it's a bad idea.

29:40.125 --> 29:41.625
What? Why?

29:41.709 --> 29:44.458
You forget:
I saw everything. I was there.

29:44.542 --> 29:46.458
I saw what that divorce
did to you,

29:46.542 --> 29:47.959
and I was the one
that had to

29:48.041 --> 29:50.000
slowly scrape you off the floor
month by month.

29:50.083 --> 29:52.375
I don't want to have to do that
again, for both of our sakes.

29:52.458 --> 29:53.875
You won't, I promise.

29:53.959 --> 29:55.750
This is gonna be different.

29:56.917 --> 29:58.291
-Hey, guys.
-How's it going?

29:58.375 --> 29:59.834
-Hey.
-Hey.

29:59.917 --> 30:03.041
So I had one of the engineers
program the simulator

30:03.125 --> 30:04.917
with one of my
favorite spots on Earth.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.250
I don't even know if it
still exists for real,

30:07.333 --> 30:10.417
but I thought
we could go, anyway.

30:10.500 --> 30:12.000
Gordon, you and Bortus
should come, too.

30:12.083 --> 30:13.000
I already invited Talla.

30:14.166 --> 30:17.041
Sounds great.

30:17.125 --> 30:18.834
(loud dance music playing)

30:37.792 --> 30:40.083
I don't know how much more
of this I can take.

30:40.166 --> 30:41.750
Dude, it's so loud.

30:41.834 --> 30:44.917
-Come dance, you guys.
-Yeah, it's so fun out there.

30:45.000 --> 30:46.125
You know, I think
we're just gonna stay here

30:46.208 --> 30:47.250
and finish our drinks.

30:47.333 --> 30:49.417
-What?
-We're just gonna
finish our drinks.

30:49.500 --> 30:51.542
-The bathroom's that way.
-No, no, I said...

30:51.625 --> 30:54.709
-What?
-We're just gonna stay here
and blow our brains out.

30:54.792 --> 30:56.667
-Okay, cool!
-Okay.

31:00.083 --> 31:01.125
Hey, is that Yaphit?

31:04.542 --> 31:06.875
That's nothing. Look!

31:13.125 --> 31:15.750
This is glorious!

31:15.834 --> 31:19.583
The music is very similar to
a popular mating song on Moclus.

31:19.667 --> 31:21.375
You must come dance with us.

31:21.458 --> 31:23.041
We're okay, but thanks!

31:23.125 --> 31:26.000
The restroom?
It is that way.

31:27.041 --> 31:28.917
Bortus, listen.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.875
We must return to the dance!

31:33.625 --> 31:36.125
The night is ours!

31:38.458 --> 31:40.166
Is this what you want?

32:05.625 --> 32:07.709
Every mature person
has to make peace

32:07.792 --> 32:10.125
with the fact that they
used to be dumber,

32:10.208 --> 32:13.166
but to have it thrown
in your face every single day--

32:13.250 --> 32:15.125
man, it sucks.

32:15.208 --> 32:17.083
You're handling it
a lot better than I would.

32:17.166 --> 32:18.834
Well, she's... she has no clue.

32:18.917 --> 32:20.625
You know, she looks
at something like marriage

32:20.709 --> 32:23.625
and sees this emotional high
all the way to the horizon,

32:23.709 --> 32:25.041
which it isn't.

32:25.125 --> 32:28.166
You know, it...
it changes and evolves.

32:28.250 --> 32:30.583
It goes through phases. I mean,
there's times you feel like

32:30.667 --> 32:32.959
you d-you don't
love the other person anymore

32:33.041 --> 32:36.709
and you'll never love them
again, and then one day you do.

32:36.792 --> 32:39.208
You should've heard the way
she talked to me.

32:39.291 --> 32:41.333
The young always
dismiss the old.

32:41.417 --> 32:43.333
It's a way of pushing away
the truth.

32:43.417 --> 32:45.041
You just called me old.

32:45.125 --> 32:46.125
(both laughing)

32:46.208 --> 32:49.000
You're not old.

32:49.083 --> 32:51.041
(sighs)

32:53.041 --> 32:54.959
Is she right, though?

32:55.041 --> 32:57.041
Am I a disappointment to myself?

32:57.125 --> 33:00.750
She's-she's me,
so it's hard to deny it.

33:00.834 --> 33:03.041
Don't let her make you
feel sorry for yourself.

33:03.125 --> 33:04.834
You've done great things.

33:04.917 --> 33:07.333
You're smart and powerful.

33:07.417 --> 33:09.750
You're a kind
and generous friend.

33:09.834 --> 33:11.166
And to top it off,

33:11.250 --> 33:13.875
you're the commander
of a Union ship.

33:13.959 --> 33:17.166
I used to think I'd be a captain
at this point in my life.

33:17.250 --> 33:18.458
You got married.

33:18.542 --> 33:20.458
Even that didn't work out.

33:20.542 --> 33:23.083
You know, I thought I'd have
a husband and kids by now,

33:23.166 --> 33:24.250
a-a real life.

33:24.333 --> 33:26.250
Real is relative.

33:26.333 --> 33:28.458
I dated an artificial life-form

33:28.542 --> 33:30.500
and thought I found
my perfect match.

33:30.583 --> 33:32.000
Goals change.

33:32.083 --> 33:35.083
Things become more
beautifully complicated,

33:35.166 --> 33:39.667
and so we have to stop
every so often and reassess.

33:39.750 --> 33:42.250
What is it you really want?

34:03.333 --> 34:04.542
What do you think?

34:07.250 --> 34:09.291
I replicated it to match one
I have at home.

34:09.375 --> 34:13.250
Wait a minute, that's right.
I remember that.

34:13.333 --> 34:15.625
That's the one Kelly wore
on our one-year anniversary.

34:15.709 --> 34:18.917
For God's sake, I was...
I was trying to surprise you.

34:19.000 --> 34:22.542
Well, you know what, it's even
better the second time around.

34:22.625 --> 34:24.959
Good save there, Mercer.

34:28.959 --> 34:31.333

34:52.625 --> 34:54.458

-Yeah, yeah.

34:54.542 --> 34:56.542

Uh, doesn't... doesn't this

35:48.458 --> 35:50.166

35:51.250 --> 35:52.750
No, not to me.

35:52.834 --> 35:56.000
Look, I'm not saying
I don't want to.

35:56.083 --> 35:58.166
Believe me.

35:58.250 --> 36:00.291
It's just...

36:00.375 --> 36:03.250
I've already felt all of this...

36:03.333 --> 36:04.834
with someone else.

36:05.917 --> 36:08.125
Oh.

36:10.667 --> 36:13.583
Seven years ago, she was you,

36:13.667 --> 36:17.208
and I was completely
in love with her.

36:17.291 --> 36:20.250
And, yes, she has
changed a lot over seven years,

36:20.333 --> 36:21.458
but so have I.

36:21.542 --> 36:24.291
We've evolved together.

36:25.417 --> 36:29.291

Well, Vendek 2 has
a covariant ring system,

-That's right.

37:22.375 --> 37:24.667

37:28.083 --> 37:30.041
Jovian rings

37:30.125 --> 37:31.875
So we join the pack.

37:31.959 --> 37:33.417
We slip inside the rings

37:33.500 --> 37:35.166
and jettison as much water
as we can,

37:35.250 --> 37:37.750
which should create
a film of ice around the hull.
