00:48.840 --> 00:50.258
No, not at all.

I'll make it up to them

- Is, um, is this the juice guy?
- Yeah.

00:59.309 --> 01:02.479
I just have to put together
a good investor presentation,

01:02.479 --> 01:04.981
and, and if he likes it, then--

01:05.356 --> 01:06.441

01:07.567 --> 01:10.278
- Free juice for life.

01:14.491 --> 01:17.827
I had a really great time
with you... this weekend.

01:18.244 --> 01:19.120
Me too.

01:19.120 --> 01:20.163
And...

01:20.580 --> 01:23.666
I'm really grateful
that you said what you said

01:24.584 --> 01:29.964
because I wasn't brave enough
to be the first one to say it.

01:29.964 --> 01:31.633
Now, I kind of feel like

01:31.633 --> 01:34.260
we could tell
each other anything,

01:34.260 --> 01:38.807
and that's... really cool.

01:38.807 --> 01:41.101
You can't trust anything
she says. Proven fact.

01:41.101 --> 01:43.478
You should never have been
the first one to say

01:43.978 --> 01:44.896
the thing.

01:44.896 --> 01:45.897
"I love you."

01:46.231 --> 01:47.357
We don't have to repeat it.

01:48.316 --> 01:49.776
You're rushing into this.

01:50.568 --> 01:52.904
- What're you thinkin' about?
- Nothing.

01:52.904 --> 01:54.739
Now she knows
how fuckin' weak you are.

01:54.739 --> 01:57.367
Nothing at all?
Just... no thoughts?

01:57.367 --> 01:59.035
Oh, she's gonna
eat you alive!

01:59.035 --> 02:00.537
Just blank.

02:00.537 --> 02:02.330

Uh, yeah.
I'm just feeling a little stuck.

04:40.905 --> 04:42.532
I've been tryna figure
out the ending

04:42.532 --> 04:43.992
of this book for two weeks now.

04:43.992 --> 04:44.909
I could help...

04:45.451 --> 04:47.328
if you let me
read it.

04:47.328 --> 04:49.580
I don't want you to see
any of it until it's actually--

04:49.706 --> 04:51.916
Until it's perfect?

04:51.916 --> 04:53.459
No. Mediocre

04:53.459 --> 04:55.336
is what I was going for, actually.

04:55.753 --> 04:58.131
Hey... you know you
don't have to go.

04:58.131 --> 05:01.217
I have
the presentation tomorrow,

05:01.217 --> 05:04.053
and I've already spent the night
three nights this week, so.

05:04.762 --> 05:07.515
Huh... didn't realize
you were keeping count.

05:08.433 --> 05:11.686
Okay. I'm not.
That was an estimate.

05:12.437 --> 05:14.856
How 'bout I, uh,
give you a call tomorrow?

05:20.361 --> 05:21.654
- Bye.
Bye.

05:35.084 --> 05:37.211
Aah! What's going on?!

05:37.211 --> 05:39.797
Get your shit! We have to go.
Right now.

05:40.465 --> 05:42.467
- Dave's back.
- Who-- Who's Dave?

05:42.467 --> 05:45.303
Uh, Dave lives here.
He owns this place.

05:45.303 --> 05:47.096
I didn't know
we were subletting.

05:47.096 --> 05:48.306
We aren't.

05:48.306 --> 05:50.308
Where the fuck is my diaphragm?

05:52.393 --> 05:53.978
It never felt like
an illegal squat,

05:53.978 --> 05:55.980
but I guess that's
neither here nor there.

05:55.980 --> 05:58.441
Yeah, squatting's, sort of,
independent of your feelings.

05:58.441 --> 06:00.026
I-- I promise
I'm gonna start looking

06:00.026 --> 06:01.277
for my own place right away.

06:01.277 --> 06:02.779
There's no rush.

06:02.779 --> 06:06.115
- Wow! Your room is so cute.
Thanks.

06:06.115 --> 06:07.909
Uh, that wasn't
a compliment, dude.

06:07.909 --> 06:10.578
Yeah. No woman wants to fuck
a grown man with a cute bedroom.

06:10.578 --> 06:12.580
You need to get her
the fuck outta here

06:12.580 --> 06:14.540
before she sees
all your humiliating shit.

06:14.540 --> 06:17.835
Ah... this must be
the infamous Yogurt.

06:17.835 --> 06:19.003
- Hi!

06:19.003 --> 06:20.338
- No, no. I wouldn't-- Yeah.
- Oh my god!

06:20.338 --> 06:21.672
- Good boy.

06:21.672 --> 06:23.257
Yeah, he's not great
with people.

06:23.257 --> 06:25.134
Hey, it's okay. You're okay.

06:25.134 --> 06:26.344
Sorry.

06:26.344 --> 06:27.804
There you go.

06:27.804 --> 06:30.181
What's this? Like a little,
little inspiration wall?

06:30.181 --> 06:31.182
Bro?

06:31.182 --> 06:32.141
- Uh--
Yeah, I'm dyin'

06:32.141 --> 06:33.518
to hear you explain this shit.

06:33.518 --> 06:36.187
No, tho-- those are
just pictures that I, um--

06:36.187 --> 06:38.189
You what?
- that I found.

06:38.189 --> 06:39.649
Yeah, I, I just-- I like,

06:39.649 --> 06:41.609
I like the way
they look together, so I--

06:42.193 --> 06:43.486
Is that an office?

06:44.987 --> 06:46.280
That's the Corinthian.

06:47.782 --> 06:50.576
It's, um, it's a condo.

06:50.576 --> 06:51.911
- It's--
- Kinda sterile.

06:51.911 --> 06:53.996
Well, it has great amenities.

06:53.996 --> 06:55.706
- What, what are these?
- Oh, great!

06:55.706 --> 06:57.208
She found your dungeons
and dork shit.

06:57.208 --> 06:58.751
- Uh--
Fuck!

06:58.751 --> 07:02.046
those are just from...
my old job.

07:02.046 --> 07:04.257
- I drew them.
Game over, man!

07:04.257 --> 07:05.842
You, you drew these?

07:05.842 --> 07:08.636
Yeah, I, I thought I told you
I worked in video games.

07:08.636 --> 07:11.055
Yeah, uh, but I just assumed
you did, like,

07:11.055 --> 07:12.974
video game finances
or something.

07:12.974 --> 07:15.226
I... I didn't know
you were an artist.

07:15.226 --> 07:17.145
Well, it--
it's not, actually, art.

07:17.145 --> 07:18.604
That's just what they call it.

07:18.604 --> 07:19.897
- But it's--
- I love this guy.

07:19.897 --> 07:21.107
Oh, no, no!

07:21.107 --> 07:22.358
She found the wizard.

07:22.358 --> 07:23.693
Ah, there's no goin'
back from this.

07:24.277 --> 07:26.654
- What's his name?
Cyprian.

07:26.654 --> 07:28.072
And he's a wizard?

07:28.072 --> 07:29.866
A sixth-level sorcerer

07:29.866 --> 07:31.951
with ninth-level powers
of necromancy.

07:31.951 --> 07:33.327
He's--

07:33.327 --> 07:35.204
Yeah, he's, basically, a wizard.

07:35.204 --> 07:37.123
You never told me
about any of this.

07:37.123 --> 07:38.624
I didn't even know you drew.

07:38.624 --> 07:41.294
Well... it was a long time ago.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.921
Oh, he's a magnificent artist.

07:43.921 --> 07:46.966
And the things he would do
with papier-mâché.

07:46.966 --> 07:49.051
Oh! Talk about a wizard.

07:49.051 --> 07:53.973
So, you gave up all this
to... do... banking?

07:54.932 --> 07:57.727
Well, he wasn't gonna draw
video games for his entire life.

07:57.727 --> 08:00.480
He has goals. He has things
to accomplish.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.857
I couldn't just do
concept art forever.

08:03.483 --> 08:04.692
I have goals.

08:05.735 --> 08:07.028
It's just--

08:07.945 --> 08:09.614
It wasn't me anymore.

08:24.045 --> 08:28.591
Hi, hi, hi, hi!

08:28.591 --> 08:30.760
Hi, friends. Hi.

08:30.760 --> 08:33.513
Okay, so I know we're all
waiting on Xander Duggins,

08:33.513 --> 08:35.640
and he should be arriving
at any moment,

08:35.640 --> 08:37.600
but in the meantime,

08:37.600 --> 08:41.103
how would you guys
like to be part of a focus group

08:41.103 --> 08:43.064
for a brand new,

08:43.064 --> 08:47.109
as-yet unpublished,
work-in-progress story

08:47.109 --> 08:51.322
about a fun friend
named Squid the Squirrel

08:51.322 --> 08:53.074
who's tryna figure out

08:53.074 --> 08:56.118
who she really is
and where she really belongs.

08:59.205 --> 09:01.666
Great. So, there's no
illustrations yet,

09:01.666 --> 09:03.709
so we're just gonna have
to use our imaginations,

09:03.709 --> 09:07.296
but hey, that's twice the fun.
Am I right?

09:09.006 --> 09:10.591
With the growth levels
we're targeting,

09:10.591 --> 09:13.219
even after you factor
in for supply volatility,

09:13.219 --> 09:14.554
with the three Ps:

09:14.554 --> 09:17.390
- Pineapple, Papaya, Passion fruit--
- I, uh,

09:18.432 --> 09:19.600
uh, yeah, I have a question.

09:20.142 --> 09:21.644
Well, we're actually, um,

09:21.644 --> 09:23.062
timing the presentation
right now

09:23.062 --> 09:24.438
just to see how long
it's gonna be

09:24.438 --> 09:25.731
for when actually
presenting to investors.

09:25.731 --> 09:27.066
Should I stop the timer?

09:27.066 --> 09:30.820
So, I'm over here kinda
wondering like,

09:30.820 --> 09:33.030
"Does this guy even like juice?"

09:33.656 --> 09:36.534
I... I like juice a lot.

09:37.660 --> 09:39.328
What's your favorite blend?

09:41.163 --> 09:42.415
- Uh--
- See?

09:42.415 --> 09:44.083
That should be split second.

09:44.083 --> 09:46.168
Orange Kiwi Crisis. I blanked.

09:46.168 --> 09:48.504
I can't have somebody
sellin' my company

09:48.504 --> 09:51.299
that's not on fire with juice.

09:51.299 --> 09:53.634
I am very much on fire.

09:53.634 --> 09:54.885
He's totally aflame.

09:54.885 --> 09:56.137
So, where's the passion?

09:56.137 --> 09:57.638
Huh? 'Cause I see

09:57.638 --> 10:00.016
numbers and I see graphs.

10:00.016 --> 10:01.225
Well, you really
want great graphs

10:01.225 --> 10:02.351
in an investment presentation.

10:02.351 --> 10:03.603
Fuck graphs.

10:04.103 --> 10:06.314
Where's my Snapple killer?

10:07.982 --> 10:08.983
Hey.

10:09.483 --> 10:11.027
He's right here.

10:11.444 --> 10:12.486
Okay?

10:12.486 --> 10:15.031
Yeah, well, uh,
unfortunately, Miguel,

10:17.074 --> 10:18.159
I just don't see it.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.579
Eight minutes and 32 seconds.

10:23.456 --> 10:24.957
"But suddenly, it struck her,

10:24.957 --> 10:26.834
"like a bolt from on high,

10:26.834 --> 10:30.546
"the owl had been wrong,
and so had the fly.

10:30.546 --> 10:33.549
"Squid might've been different,
that much was true,

10:33.549 --> 10:35.468
"but she was a squirrel,

10:35.468 --> 10:38.054
a squirrel through and through."

10:38.054 --> 10:39.972
So, uh,
by a quick show of hands,

10:39.972 --> 10:42.391
who here preferred that ending
to ending number one,

10:42.391 --> 10:45.978
in which Squid discovers
that she is, actually, a squid

10:45.978 --> 10:49.148
who was abducted
by a pair of well-meaning

10:49.148 --> 10:53.986
but, ultimately, misguided
squirrels with fertility issues?

10:54.445 --> 10:56.280
What's fertility?
- Yes.

10:56.280 --> 10:58.699
I don't get it.
Is she a squid or a squirrel?

10:58.699 --> 11:01.160
Well, that's what I'm trying
to suss out, so...

11:01.160 --> 11:02.370
Yeah.

11:02.370 --> 11:05.122
Shouldn't you know what animal
your main character is?

11:05.122 --> 11:08.501
I could definitely
choose that on my own,

11:08.501 --> 11:09.960
but, you know,
I-I'm tryin' to...

11:09.960 --> 11:11.879
see what you think.
So,

11:11.879 --> 11:13.881
maybe we should
just move on to ending three.

11:13.881 --> 11:15.675
How many endings do you have?

11:17.176 --> 11:18.427
I just want you to like her.

11:18.427 --> 11:20.471
What do I need to do to
make you like her?

11:20.888 --> 11:22.348
Do you want her to be a squid,

11:22.348 --> 11:24.100
or do you want her
to be a squirrel?

11:24.100 --> 11:26.644
Or do you want her to be
an Amazonian pygmy marmoset,

11:26.644 --> 11:28.771
which I promise,
will make a lot more sense

11:28.771 --> 11:30.773
once we get through ending six.

11:30.773 --> 11:32.441
Oh!

11:32.441 --> 11:35.403
- Look, everybody! It's Xander Duggins!

11:36.070 --> 11:37.488
Yay! Okay.

11:46.914 --> 11:48.124
Great reading.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.334
Yeah... thanks.

11:51.001 --> 11:52.128
It's a wonderful book.

11:53.921 --> 11:56.757
I, actually, have a book myself.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.552
It's a-- It's about a, a squid

11:59.552 --> 12:01.345
who thinks she's a squirrel.

12:02.179 --> 12:03.723
Or it-- maybe it's about a s--

12:03.723 --> 12:05.349
a squirrel who thinks
that she's--

12:06.142 --> 12:08.728
Honestly, I-I'm having

12:08.728 --> 12:11.188
trouble figuring out
what she is.

12:11.188 --> 12:12.732
What do you want her to be?

12:12.732 --> 12:14.650
I don't know.

12:15.401 --> 12:17.862
Lately, I have just
been feeling so--

12:17.862 --> 12:19.280
Blocked.

12:19.280 --> 12:20.990
Yes!

12:21.490 --> 12:24.577
I was blocked on one book
for three and a half years.

12:25.077 --> 12:26.620
Thought it was a
writing problem.

12:27.079 --> 12:28.664
Turns out it was more of a

12:28.664 --> 12:30.249
"my ex-wife accused me of

12:30.249 --> 12:31.834
"caring more about
inanimate puppets

12:31.834 --> 12:33.711
"than my own children,
and the judge agreed,

12:33.711 --> 12:36.338
and now I'm essentially
penniless" problem.

12:36.797 --> 12:38.174
Had to get past that,

12:38.174 --> 12:39.842
and then I sat down

12:39.842 --> 12:42.595
and finished that book
in an hour flat.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.764
H-- How did you get unblocked?

12:49.351 --> 12:51.020
Are you a cop?

13:00.279 --> 13:04.158
Hey... so I guess it's just us.

13:04.742 --> 13:07.787
Your dad had a teacher
conference in Delaware?

13:11.540 --> 13:12.625
Whatcha doin'?

13:14.835 --> 13:16.170
I blew my presentation today.

13:16.712 --> 13:18.631
Chad and Kevin had to
convince Trip to come back

13:18.631 --> 13:20.090
tomorrow morning for a redo.

13:20.090 --> 13:22.051
So, now I have to come up
with something to say

13:22.051 --> 13:24.386
to show how passionate
I am about juice,

13:24.845 --> 13:26.013
or there's no chance

13:26.013 --> 13:28.015
I'm making associate
by the end of the year.

13:28.015 --> 13:30.392
And we're sure that's
a bad thing, right?

13:31.894 --> 13:35.356
It's just... you don't seem
to like it very much.

13:35.356 --> 13:37.149
You know, your job.

13:38.359 --> 13:40.027
I'm not going back
to video games.

13:40.027 --> 13:42.238
But... if you don't
love what you do--

13:42.238 --> 13:44.740
Most people don't get
to love what they do.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.910
What do you love, exactly?

13:49.203 --> 13:51.705
'Cause I don't really get a
whole lot of feelings from you.

13:52.414 --> 13:54.458
You know, you'll open up to me
and you'll say all this stuff,

13:54.458 --> 13:56.418
and then, all of a sudden,
you slam the door shut

13:56.418 --> 13:57.795
and you're just gone.

13:57.795 --> 13:59.672
I have no idea what
you're thinking.

14:00.297 --> 14:02.007
People aren't always
thinking things.

14:02.007 --> 14:03.759
You keep things from me.

14:04.718 --> 14:05.886
Your drawings.

14:05.886 --> 14:07.263
I'd never even seen your house

14:07.263 --> 14:08.806
until I showed up
at your doorstep

14:08.806 --> 14:10.266
because I-I lost my apartment.

14:14.478 --> 14:15.688
You all right?

14:16.605 --> 14:17.815
It's expired.

14:18.440 --> 14:19.984
It's two years old.

14:19.984 --> 14:23.863
Oh my god.
It's, like, fermented.

14:23.863 --> 14:26.240
- Oh, oh, oh, oh!

14:29.285 --> 14:31.704
Why is that worse
than the juice?

14:32.079 --> 14:35.541
Because it's... psilocybin.

14:35.666 --> 14:36.959
It's what?

14:36.959 --> 14:39.378
Magic mushroom tea?

14:39.378 --> 14:41.505
Supposedly, it is very

14:41.505 --> 14:44.091
- helpful in unblocking--
- It's drugs.

14:44.091 --> 14:45.467
I just took drugs.

14:46.468 --> 14:47.761
How much drugs did I just drink?

14:47.761 --> 14:49.430
Well, I, I only

14:49.430 --> 14:53.767
took a few sips,
so not a small amount.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.394
I've never done drugs.

14:55.394 --> 14:58.188
Yes, I-- I-- I'm beginning
to gather that.

15:00.983 --> 15:02.443
Are you gonna be okay?

15:03.193 --> 15:05.905
Yeah, no, I'm fine. I'm--

15:08.282 --> 15:09.533
It'll be fun, I bet.

15:17.166 --> 15:18.375
Still nothing?

15:19.168 --> 15:20.169
Nope.

15:24.840 --> 15:26.008
It's been an hour.

15:28.302 --> 15:30.304
Maybe neither of
us took enough.

15:31.347 --> 15:33.474
Are you sure you didn't
get a bad batch?

15:33.807 --> 15:35.100
I did...

15:35.100 --> 15:37.686
purchase them from
a marionettist with a ukulele,

15:37.686 --> 15:40.105
and what sounded like
a terrible first marriage,

15:40.105 --> 15:44.526
so...
definitely wouldn't surprise me.

15:45.235 --> 15:46.862
Um, I'm gonna get some air.

15:47.988 --> 15:49.406
Wait, but are we,

15:50.282 --> 15:52.785
are we totally sure
that's a good idea?

15:53.535 --> 15:56.330
If it was gonna happen,
it would've happened already.

15:57.456 --> 15:59.792
Yeah... Yeah,
you're probably right.

Is that you?

17:50.027 --> 17:52.196
Well, good evening and hello.

17:52.196 --> 17:54.865
Ned! No! Are you kidding me?

17:54.865 --> 17:56.700
My goodness!

17:56.700 --> 17:59.536
I did just enough fucking drugs
for you to show up?!

18:00.079 --> 18:02.831
What'd you expect, Linds?
You wanted to dig deep, right?

18:02.831 --> 18:04.583
Why are you deep inside me?

18:05.042 --> 18:06.460
I'm your block.

18:06.460 --> 18:09.755
- Surprise!
- No. No, it can't be.

18:09.755 --> 18:11.715
You're filled with guilt
over what ya did to me.

18:11.715 --> 18:13.926
You tried shovin' it all down, but...

18:14.384 --> 18:15.719
I'm still here.

18:16.178 --> 18:19.515
I don't feel guilty about
what I did at all. In fact, I feel great.

18:19.515 --> 18:21.642
You're stuck because you've written
a character no one could ever like.

18:21.642 --> 18:22.976
A character who abandons
the creatures

18:22.976 --> 18:25.354
who love her to go on some,
kind of, half-baked,

18:25.354 --> 18:27.231
coniferous rumspringa.

18:27.231 --> 18:30.067
And you can't decide
is she a squid or a squirrel

18:30.067 --> 18:32.319
or a sloth with
a pituitary disorder

18:32.319 --> 18:35.572
because she's not
an animal at all.

18:36.573 --> 18:38.075
She's a monster.

18:39.076 --> 18:40.494
Just like you.

18:42.496 --> 18:43.872
I'm not a monster.

18:44.248 --> 18:46.375
Oh! Really, Linds?

18:47.876 --> 18:49.670
What's
in the suitcase?

18:53.132 --> 18:55.634
Why don't
you open it?

18:55.634 --> 18:57.845
Ooh, give Miguel a little peek
while we're at it?

18:57.845 --> 19:00.556
I'm sure he'd be
very interested in the contents.

19:15.404 --> 19:18.407
Are you prepared
to face the battles ahead?

19:19.741 --> 19:20.742
No.

19:21.577 --> 19:22.786
Not at all.

19:23.704 --> 19:25.539
I don't have any armor or...

19:26.165 --> 19:27.374
weapons.

19:27.374 --> 19:28.667
You will.

23:13.225 --> 23:15.560
I didn't know if I should
wake you or just--

23:22.818 --> 23:24.319
I feel a lotta things.

23:26.238 --> 23:28.698

23:29.282 --> 23:31.910

24:06.319 --> 24:07.988
I learned all that from you.

24:12.033 --> 24:14.411
And the drugs did help
provide confirmation.

24:14.411 --> 24:15.745
- Well, sure.
- But, um--

24:16.204 --> 24:17.372
What about you?

24:17.372 --> 24:18.665
Did you?

24:19.332 --> 24:21.668
I didn't really get
that much out of it.

24:21.793 --> 24:23.044
Seriously?

24:23.044 --> 24:24.796
- Yeah.

24:26.006 --> 24:27.549
Yeah, I th-think my...

24:28.258 --> 24:30.135
- hair felt kinda heavy at one point,

24:30.135 --> 24:32.387
but... that was pretty much it.

24:32.387 --> 24:34.556
That's so weird. I didn't feel
anything like that at all.
