Attorney's Office to see you.

11:02.996 --> 11:04.396
- Chief Boden--
- Hey.

11:04.398 --> 11:06.064
Assistant State's Attorney
Steve Kot.

11:06.066 --> 11:08.066
I'm handling
the Roger Maddox arson case.

11:08.068 --> 11:11.903
- Oh, I thought you were here
for something else.

11:11.905 --> 11:14.806
- The aggravated battery charges
pending against you?

11:14.808 --> 11:17.342
- There you go.
- Yeah, I'm here about both.

11:17.344 --> 11:19.878
The latter could compromise
your ability to testify

11:19.880 --> 11:21.046
in the former.

11:21.048 --> 11:22.981
- What do you want
me to testify for?

11:22.983 --> 11:24.082
You need Gabriela Dawson.

11:24.084 --> 11:25.283
She's the arson investigator

11:25.285 --> 11:26.885
who first linked Maddox
to the fires.

11:26.887 --> 11:28.953
- We'll put Miss Dawson
on the stand absolutely,

11:28.955 --> 11:32.223
but remember
who we're dealing with here.

11:32.225 --> 11:34.192
Maddox is
a take-no-prisoners type.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.927
He employs
an army of lawyers

11:35.929 --> 11:38.897
to help him kick old ladies
out of their homes,

11:38.899 --> 11:42.067
but you're a decorated
battalion chief in the CFD.

11:42.069 --> 11:43.334
You're a voice of authority.

11:43.336 --> 11:45.003
You can gain the trust
of the jury

11:45.005 --> 11:47.939
and help us frame this case
in plain language,

11:47.941 --> 11:50.809
but only if you dispel
these accusations against you.

11:50.811 --> 11:52.143
- Those accusations
are unrelated

11:52.145 --> 11:53.445
and invented
from whole cloth.

11:53.447 --> 11:55.213
- Doesn't matter.
If you don't clear them up

11:55.215 --> 11:57.215
before the Maddox case
goes to trial,

11:57.217 --> 11:59.050
you're worthless to us
as a witness.

12:03.824 --> 12:07.225
- Does Maddox know
that I'm supposed to testify?

12:07.227 --> 12:08.493
- I assume so.

12:08.495 --> 12:11.262
I'm required to disclose
the witness list to his lawyers.

12:16.858 --> 12:18.347

She says it's an emergency.

12:23.410 --> 12:24.476
- Donna?
- Wallace...

12:24.478 --> 12:26.845

12:39.760 --> 12:41.493
- Wallace.
- This is insanity.

12:41.495 --> 12:42.827
You okay?
- No, I'm fine,

12:42.829 --> 12:44.529
but--but you need
to talk to Wheeler.

12:44.531 --> 12:47.499
Tell him Serena got into a car
with some man.

12:47.501 --> 12:50.034
He won't listen to me.
- Okay, okay.

12:50.036 --> 12:52.871
Wheeler, you don't need
to do this.

12:54.407 --> 12:55.790
- I asked the prosecutor
and a judge

12:55.791 --> 12:57.174
to sign this search warrant,
so I'm definitely doing this.

12:57.177 --> 13:00.211
- Listen to me,
Roger Maddox is setting me up.

13:00.213 --> 13:01.479
- Who?
- Roger Maddox.

13:01.481 --> 13:02.797
He's charged with arson.

13:02.798 --> 13:04.114
I'm supposed
to be testifying against him.

13:04.117 --> 13:06.050
This is nothing more
than an attempt to discredit me.

13:06.052 --> 13:07.886
- Chief, when were you gonna
tell me that you got into

13:07.888 --> 13:09.220
a confrontation
with Serena Holmes

13:09.222 --> 13:10.321
early this morning?

13:10.323 --> 13:11.456
- Wheeler, you're not
hearing me.

13:11.458 --> 13:13.291
- I need to know
what happened with Serena.

13:13.293 --> 13:15.360
- My wife and her--
she exchanged words.

13:15.362 --> 13:16.895
She drove away.
That's all.

13:16.897 --> 13:17.929
- Is it?
- Yeah.

13:17.931 --> 13:19.464
- Because now she's MIA.

13:20.867 --> 13:21.966
- She's missing.
- That's right.

13:21.968 --> 13:23.234
My witness has vanished.

13:23.236 --> 13:25.370
You and your wife are
the last people seen with her,

13:25.372 --> 13:27.038
so step aside.

13:27.040 --> 13:28.506
Let's go.

13:28.508 --> 13:31.976
<i> [dramatic music]</i>

13:35.415 --> 13:37.482
- Unbelievable.
- I guess if Maddox is willing

13:37.484 --> 13:39.050
to torch a building
to close a deal,

13:39.052 --> 13:41.319
he'd have no qualms about hiring
someone to set you up.

13:41.321 --> 13:43.087
- Is this Wheeler guy
gonna follow up on it?

13:43.089 --> 13:45.290
- I have to bring him something
more than just my suspicion.

13:45.292 --> 13:47.959
I need to find a hard link
between Serena and Maddox.

13:47.961 --> 13:49.994
- I'll call Antonio
and see if he can do

13:49.996 --> 13:51.830
anymore digging for you.
- I'll talk to Riddle.

13:51.832 --> 13:53.531
If you're being targeted
over an arson investigation,

13:53.533 --> 13:55.233
CFD needs
to have your back.

13:56.169 --> 13:58.503
- I should reach out to Jaime.

13:58.505 --> 14:01.906
- That's your lawyer friend
who went to go work for Maddox?

14:01.908 --> 14:03.374
- If she could shed any light
on this--

14:03.376 --> 14:04.943
- I didn't bring you all here
hoping that you

14:04.945 --> 14:06.244
would solve this mess for me.

14:06.246 --> 14:08.379
- Of course not, Chief,
but we're gonna do all we can.

14:12.152 --> 14:13.484
- Thanks.

14:15.288 --> 14:16.921
- It's a silly policy,

14:16.923 --> 14:18.890
and you can tell your supervisor
I said so.

14:20.026 --> 14:23.094
RV is registered
to a rental company in Denver.

14:23.096 --> 14:24.462
They won't tell me
who rented it--

14:24.464 --> 14:26.965
sensitive customer information.

14:26.967 --> 14:30.168
- Let's name him Leonardo.

14:30.170 --> 14:32.403
[dog growls and whines]

14:32.405 --> 14:34.873
- I don't know much
about reptiles,

14:34.875 --> 14:36.507
but something
seems wrong with him.

14:36.509 --> 14:38.977
- Guys, Boden said to take care
of that thing.

14:38.979 --> 14:40.311
If it dies on our watch--

14:40.313 --> 14:42.313
- I got food for the big boy.

14:42.315 --> 14:45.316
- But the tortoise
is acting super sluggish.

14:45.318 --> 14:49.120
- Well, anybody give him water?
He could be dehydrated.

14:49.122 --> 14:52.123
<i> [mellow music]</i>

14:52.125 --> 14:53.992
Okay, I'll get it some water.

14:53.994 --> 14:57.428
- Dehydrated, okay,
that's not so bad.

15:01.134 --> 15:02.400
We'll get him some lemonade.

15:02.401 --> 15:03.667
- What's happening, Freddie?

15:03.670 --> 15:05.370
- Oh, yo, what up?

15:06.306 --> 15:08.306
- Cruz.

15:08.308 --> 15:11.542
- Hey, buddy,
you thirsty, hmm?

15:18.318 --> 15:20.385
I appreciate what you're doing
for Freddie,

15:20.387 --> 15:22.487
the example you're setting,

15:22.489 --> 15:24.989
but he's making himself a little
too at home around here.

15:26.526 --> 15:27.992
- I'll talk to him.
No problem.

15:27.994 --> 15:29.127
- We need some ground rules:

15:29.129 --> 15:30.662
shorter visits
only when you're here,

15:30.664 --> 15:32.263
only if he doesn't get
in the way,

15:32.265 --> 15:34.365
and at some point,

15:34.367 --> 15:35.533
little bird's
got to leave the nest.

15:35.535 --> 15:37.135
- But the other day,
you said he was welcome.

15:37.137 --> 15:39.704
- I did, and now I'm saying
we need ground rules.

15:40.707 --> 15:42.640
- Sure, got it.

15:51.151 --> 15:53.251
- Yup, okay, sure.
- Thank you.

15:53.253 --> 15:54.552
- I'll have Denise
send it all over.

15:56.456 --> 15:57.622
Yup, thanks, Elliot.

15:58.525 --> 16:00.491
Well...

don't you?

16:06.366 --> 16:07.532
Still mad, huh?

16:09.669 --> 16:11.269
Please, sit.

16:11.271 --> 16:14.105
Carrying around a grudge
that big must be exhausting.

16:14.107 --> 16:16.474
- This won't take long.
- Kelly...

16:17.444 --> 16:19.010
It's good to see you.

16:29.255 --> 16:30.722
Did you get
your rank reinstated?

16:30.724 --> 16:32.056
- Not yet, I will.

16:34.394 --> 16:36.995
- My big promotion--
making partner,

16:36.997 --> 16:38.997
they had to do it
after I landed Maddox,

16:38.999 --> 16:41.666
but they don't give me
any more responsibility

16:41.668 --> 16:47.005
or show me much respect, so
it's pretty insulting actually.

16:47.007 --> 16:50.441
- So why do you stay?
- The money.

16:52.245 --> 16:55.413
- I need your help.
- Name it.

16:55.415 --> 16:57.281
- My battalion chief

16:57.283 --> 16:59.283
some woman
accusing him of assault.

16:59.285 --> 17:01.319
It's obviously a set-up,

17:03.623 --> 17:04.455
and we're pretty sure
that Maddox is behind it.

17:04.456 --> 17:05.288
Her name is Serena Holmes.

17:05.291 --> 17:07.458
I need to find out
if Maddox is paying her off.

17:09.062 --> 17:10.561
- I don't know anything
about it.

17:10.563 --> 17:13.031
I honestly don't.
- But you can find out.

17:15.268 --> 17:20.104
- Kelly, you are asking me to
dig up and disclose

17:20.106 --> 17:22.273
personal information
on my client.

17:23.343 --> 17:25.410
That is a serious breach
of ethics.

I can't do it.

17:28.314 --> 17:29.647
I'm sorry.

- Okay, when a girl
says, "I had a fun time.

18:01.181 --> 18:02.864

does that mean

that she had a fun time
and she wants to do it again,

18:04.551 --> 18:06.818

that she had an average time

she ever saw your face again?

18:10.623 --> 18:12.824

Do you think
you should do it again?

18:22.402 --> 18:23.835
- Yeah.

was find an inside angle,

on this guy?

out of ladies' shower.

33:36.015 --> 33:37.381
- Over here.

33:45.090 --> 33:46.490
- Get the thermal camera.

33:46.492 --> 33:48.258
- Herrmann, eight-foot ladder
and tools.

33:50.029 --> 33:51.194
- Fire Department,

34:10.816 --> 34:13.150
Are you hurt?

34:13.152 --> 34:14.818

34:14.820 --> 34:18.789
- Nope, he's right there.

34:20.592 --> 34:22.092
- I'm caught on something.

It hurts like a bitch.

- Hang in there.
We'll get you out.

34:33.305 --> 34:36.540
Yup, think you got snagged
on a screw.

34:38.377 --> 34:40.277
Think we need
to cut into the duct.

34:41.480 --> 34:43.146

that thermal camera.

All right,
I'm gonna back the screw out.

- Almost done.

Whoa, whoa, whoa,

Matt, you okay?

35:13.712 --> 35:15.245
- Herrmann, grab him!

35:18.217 --> 35:19.683
- He's back in the ducts.

35:19.685 --> 35:21.818
- I think he made it
to a roof vent.

35:21.820 --> 35:25.122

36:24.349 --> 36:27.317

I know I did.

You--you need

36:35.294 --> 36:37.794
We'd be better off letting
the candidate drive the truck.

36:37.796 --> 36:40.463

I've got my CDL.

36:40.465 --> 36:42.015
- Forget it.

36:42.016 --> 36:43.566
We're not letting
the candidate drive the truck.

36:43.569 --> 36:45.835
- Guys, where is
the tortoise?

36:45.837 --> 36:47.837
- You know, it's really too cold
for him out here.

36:47.839 --> 36:48.872
Maybe it went
inside seeking warmth.

36:48.874 --> 36:51.208

this is Debbie Green

my husband Jeremy.

36:58.684 --> 37:00.850
- Yeah, the paramedics
found him.

37:00.852 --> 37:02.819
- We had no idea
he was coming to town.

37:02.821 --> 37:05.455
I took a job here in Chicago
and brought Zack with me,

37:05.457 --> 37:07.357
but Jeremy
stayed behind in Denver.

37:07.359 --> 37:08.725
- With my tortoise.

37:08.727 --> 37:11.261
- We think that he was
driving out to surprise us.

37:11.263 --> 37:12.996
- Um, how is he doing?

37:12.998 --> 37:14.564
- We just came
from the hospital.

37:14.566 --> 37:16.900
He's still sedated,
but they seem hopeful.

37:16.902 --> 37:18.568
- That's good to hear.

37:18.570 --> 37:21.438
- We found him!

37:21.440 --> 37:22.939
- Donatello!

37:22.941 --> 37:24.975
- I guess we had
the wrong Ninja Turtle.

37:24.977 --> 37:29.246
- There you go.

37:29.248 --> 37:32.682
- I'm gonna miss that thing.

Thanks for the update, Sarah.

37:49.401 --> 37:51.334
- Did that earn me a free drink?

37:51.336 --> 37:54.704
