WEBVTT

00:03.870 --> 00:06.205
I'm sure my mug
got mixed in with your stuff

00:06.307 --> 00:07.906
last time
we went camping.

00:08.008 --> 00:09.008
Really?
- Yeah.

00:09.110 --> 00:10.342
'Cause generally,
you put the heavy stuff

00:10.444 --> 00:11.710
in<i> my</i> backpack.

00:13.346 --> 00:14.246
Well, we have to
find it.

00:14.348 --> 00:15.781
It's my lucky mug.

00:15.883 --> 00:16.849
I'm going hunting
for three days.

00:16.951 --> 00:19.051
You want me to get eaten
by a bear?

00:19.153 --> 00:21.253
Not gonna happen.
Bears don't like gristle.

00:23.090 --> 00:25.124
Oh! Dad!

00:25.226 --> 00:26.592
Mr. Alzate!
You're busy.

00:26.694 --> 00:27.693
Don't bother reading this.

00:27.795 --> 00:29.061
Just sign it right here
real quick.

00:29.163 --> 00:30.963
You know what?
I don't generally sign things

00:31.065 --> 00:32.264
I haven't read.

00:32.366 --> 00:35.401
That's how you end up married
or in the army.

00:35.503 --> 00:38.370
Either way,
you're going to war.

00:38.472 --> 00:40.239
And you'll never pick out
your own clothes again.

00:40.341 --> 00:42.041
(laughs loudly)

00:42.143 --> 00:43.709
Classic.
Ed, tell me about the war.

00:43.811 --> 00:45.477
Dad, sign this.
- Wh--

00:45.579 --> 00:48.113
What is this? It's for my
Business Management class.

00:48.215 --> 00:50.315
It just says that I followed you
around for 20 hours.

00:50.417 --> 00:51.784
But you haven't
followed me around.

00:51.886 --> 00:52.918
Yeah, but I follow you
on Twitter,

00:53.020 --> 00:55.120
and I feel like
that's enough.

00:55.222 --> 00:57.056
I'll sign the paper, but you
have to come to work with me.

00:57.158 --> 00:58.123
Seriously?

00:58.225 --> 00:59.658
Do you really
want to do this?

00:59.760 --> 01:00.826
I mean,
neither one of us

01:00.928 --> 01:02.561
wants to spend 20 hours
together.

01:02.663 --> 01:03.996
Maybe over the course
of a year,

01:04.098 --> 01:06.665
but crammed together
into one week?

01:06.767 --> 01:07.900
Listen to this, honey.

01:08.002 --> 01:09.068
Eve's worked
at Outdoor Man.

01:09.170 --> 01:10.302
Kristin has the restaurant
down there.

01:10.404 --> 01:12.137
You're my only daughter
who hasn't spent any time

01:12.239 --> 01:13.906
at the business
I spent most of my life

01:14.008 --> 01:15.607
helping to build, okay?

01:15.709 --> 01:16.809
I found it!

01:16.911 --> 01:19.645
That's your special mug?

01:19.747 --> 01:22.347
Bears are terrified
of stainless steel, right?

01:23.350 --> 01:25.484
What do I look like,
a scientist?

01:25.586 --> 01:27.319
It just works, that's all.
Right.

01:27.421 --> 01:28.787
And just hold your water!

01:28.889 --> 01:31.423
This came
with a matching spoon.

01:31.525 --> 01:33.292
Why don't I go look
for the matching spoon?

01:33.394 --> 01:34.526
Right.
Good, good.

01:34.628 --> 01:38.163
The mug is useless
without a spoon, right?

01:38.265 --> 01:39.098
Mandy.
- Yeah.

01:39.200 --> 01:40.199
You got to do this
for your dad.

01:40.301 --> 01:42.367
(whining) Why?
Because he'd like it!

01:42.469 --> 01:43.802
Come on, don't you want to
know what he does?

01:43.904 --> 01:45.104
I already know
what he does.

01:45.206 --> 01:46.371
He sells stuff that
if you leave it outdoors,

01:46.473 --> 01:48.173
it's fine.

01:48.275 --> 01:50.609
No, there's a little more to it
than that.

01:50.711 --> 01:51.677
Now,
he wouldn't say this,

01:51.779 --> 01:53.345
but he would love to show off
for you.

01:53.447 --> 01:54.947
Come on, give it a shot.
What do you say?

01:55.049 --> 01:56.515
(groans) It would make your dad happy.
Come on.

01:56.617 --> 01:57.783
MIKE: Hey!
- Huh?

01:57.885 --> 02:00.285
Found your little folding spoon
that goes with the mug.

02:00.387 --> 02:02.354
It was right next
to this crazy straw.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.623
Must be yours, huh?

02:04.725 --> 02:06.525
No, no, it's not,
but I'll take it.

02:06.627 --> 02:08.327
That'll scare a bear,
I'll tell you.

02:08.429 --> 02:09.461
Yes, sirree.

02:09.563 --> 02:11.630
Mandy, good luck
working with your dad

02:11.732 --> 02:12.798
this week, huh?
Thanks, man.

02:12.900 --> 02:13.899
So you're going?

02:14.001 --> 02:16.034
I will be there at 10:00
with bells on.

02:16.136 --> 02:18.070
-8:00.
-I will be there at 8:00,

02:18.172 --> 02:20.572
but there will be
no bells.

02:20.674 --> 02:21.573
You know
what's amazing is

02:21.675 --> 02:23.242
you just didn't forge
my signature.

02:23.344 --> 02:25.144
You've really lost a step
since high school.

02:27.480 --> 02:31.383
♪♪

02:34.354 --> 02:36.054
I can't believe
how you handled yourself

02:36.156 --> 02:37.089
in that meeting.

02:37.191 --> 02:39.424
-I'm a born leader, honey.
-Yeah.

02:39.526 --> 02:40.993
No, I mean, there was
all that free food,

02:41.095 --> 02:43.862
and you didn't touch
any of it.

02:43.964 --> 02:45.931
It's easy because
I don't like deviled eggs.

02:47.234 --> 02:48.934
Morning, Mr. B.
Morning, Kyle.

02:49.036 --> 02:50.936
I see you have
a new management trainee.

02:51.038 --> 02:52.538
She's very attractive.

02:52.640 --> 02:54.039
Stop it.

02:54.141 --> 02:55.541
Hey, hey, hey!

02:55.643 --> 02:56.441
That's harassment.

02:56.543 --> 02:58.210
You are fired!

02:59.512 --> 03:00.679
But I liked it.

03:02.582 --> 03:03.682
You're rehired.

03:04.918 --> 03:06.251
Oh, good.

03:06.353 --> 03:07.719
For one second,
I had no idea

03:07.821 --> 03:10.088
what I was gonna do
with my life.

03:10.190 --> 03:12.724
All right, Kyle, what is
on our docket for today?

03:12.826 --> 03:15.194
Uh, you know,
just the usual.

03:15.296 --> 03:16.695
Uh, have any problems
around here

03:16.797 --> 03:18.297
that my daughter
might enjoy watching

03:18.399 --> 03:20.399
rather than me work
at the computer?

03:20.501 --> 03:22.701
A problem in the store.

03:22.803 --> 03:24.036
-Mm-hmm.
-Let me think.

03:24.138 --> 03:25.370
CHUCK: No, you don't know
what you're talking about,

03:25.472 --> 03:26.438
so just shut up!

03:26.540 --> 03:27.873
No, you shut up, okay?
(groans)

03:27.975 --> 03:30.209
'Cause I held Beverly's Fabrics
to five runs.

03:30.311 --> 03:32.611
Those gals can hit!

03:32.713 --> 03:34.112
Beverly's Fabrics.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.648
I beat Der Wienerschnitzel!

03:36.750 --> 03:38.317
Guys, can you keep it down?

03:38.419 --> 03:39.785
I'm trying to think
of a work problem

03:39.887 --> 03:41.587
for Mr. B. to deal with.

03:41.689 --> 03:42.955
(laughs)

03:43.057 --> 03:44.823
It's right here
in front of me!

03:44.925 --> 03:47.793
There's that one flip-flop
still in Lost and Found.

03:49.462 --> 03:50.996
Mike, we need you
to solve a problem.

03:51.098 --> 03:52.898
-Work-related?
-Absolutely.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.067
We need a new starting pitcher
for the softball team,

03:55.169 --> 03:56.835
and that should be me,
right?

03:56.937 --> 03:57.903
He's wrong, right?

03:58.005 --> 03:59.404
Mike, am I wrong?

03:59.506 --> 04:03.008
Almost always, Joe.
Almost always.

04:03.110 --> 04:04.309
It's a borderline
work-personal problem,

04:04.411 --> 04:06.111
but I'm on a roll, so...

04:06.213 --> 04:08.814
Okay, I'm a better pitcher
than he is.

04:08.916 --> 04:10.616
Anybody with eyes
can see that.

04:10.718 --> 04:13.819
Compelling argument
backed up by science.

04:13.921 --> 04:16.588
Except he's an idiot.

04:16.690 --> 04:19.024
Also backed up by science.

04:19.126 --> 04:20.959
All right, all right,
all right.

04:21.061 --> 04:23.128
After careful deliberation,
I'll make a decision.

04:23.230 --> 04:24.796
You're both wasting my time!

04:24.898 --> 04:26.999
Okay. Agreed.

04:27.101 --> 04:29.001
But you're never gonna get
that part of your life back,

04:29.103 --> 04:30.502
so who should pitch?

04:30.604 --> 04:32.437
I'm gonna go with George.

04:32.539 --> 04:33.338
Who's George?

04:33.440 --> 04:34.439
I don't know, but I'll find him.

04:34.541 --> 04:35.641
It's a big city, okay?

04:35.743 --> 04:37.376
No, no, no.
No, no.

04:37.478 --> 04:38.377
That's not fair!

04:39.446 --> 04:41.546
Fair went out with Obama.
Now get back to work!

04:43.383 --> 04:44.616
You know, it worked out
for the best.

04:44.718 --> 04:45.617
I didn't want to have
to buy a new glove.

04:45.719 --> 04:46.551
Yeah, what do you
want to do now?

04:46.653 --> 04:47.786
Get some lunch?
- Hey, I'm buying!

04:47.888 --> 04:50.222
I got that glove money
burning a hole in my pocket.

04:51.725 --> 04:53.125
Nice work.
No problem is too small

04:53.227 --> 04:54.226
for you to handle, huh?

04:54.328 --> 04:55.961
Or too big.

04:56.063 --> 04:57.462
I've worked out a way
to defeat ISIS

04:57.564 --> 04:59.731
10 times in my mind.

05:01.134 --> 05:03.835
Boom.
I found the other one.

05:03.937 --> 05:06.238
And they're mine.

05:06.340 --> 05:09.675
♪♪

05:09.777 --> 05:12.311
I told you my kickboxing class
was fun.

05:12.413 --> 05:15.180
I loved it when you took down
the instructor.

05:15.282 --> 05:16.381
Well, she said
to hit her,

05:16.483 --> 05:17.716
and I knew she was
expecting it,

05:17.818 --> 05:20.252
so I went for a leg sweep.

05:20.354 --> 05:21.520
Teacher got taught.

05:23.323 --> 05:24.323
Hey, Kris.
- Hey, Mom.

05:24.425 --> 05:25.857
Oh, Evie, hey. Uh, listen, honey.
Yeah.

05:25.959 --> 05:27.192
I need you to be home
this afternoon.

05:27.294 --> 05:28.860
Mm-hmm. The guy is coming
to fix the Internet.

05:28.962 --> 05:30.162
(gasps)

05:30.264 --> 05:32.097
Somebody broke
the Internet?

05:32.199 --> 05:34.166
Yeah. Yeah.

05:34.268 --> 05:36.001
I believe
that one person

05:36.103 --> 05:38.737
broke the 75 million servers

05:38.839 --> 05:40.205
which comprise
the global network

05:40.307 --> 05:42.774
which we call
"the Internet."

05:42.876 --> 05:46.011
Yeah, 'cause me old,
me not understand.

05:47.781 --> 05:50.115
Ooh, looks like
Mom had a leg sweep of her own.

05:51.184 --> 05:53.452
Okay, sure, I'll do it.

05:53.554 --> 05:54.619
I mean, what kid
wouldn't love

05:54.721 --> 05:56.588
to sit around the house
all day with no Internet?

05:56.690 --> 05:58.690
Hey, could you break the TV
while you're at it

05:58.792 --> 06:01.426
so there's absolutely
nothing to do?

06:01.528 --> 06:03.095
Thank you.
I'd do it,

06:03.197 --> 06:04.796
but I am tutoring
from 1:00 to 4:00,

06:04.898 --> 06:06.198

a staff meeting

06:06.300 --> 06:07.366
to go over
the lesson plan

06:07.468 --> 06:08.633
and then get back here
to do the laundry.

06:08.735 --> 06:09.801
Geez, Mom.

06:09.903 --> 06:11.036
You should come
to my kickboxing class,

06:11.138 --> 06:12.537
work off some
of that stress.

06:12.639 --> 06:14.439
Hitting strangers
is way more calming

06:14.541 --> 06:16.041
than meditation.
- Mm.

06:16.143 --> 06:17.309
Well, I appreciate
the offer,

06:17.411 --> 06:18.577
but I am not stressed.

06:18.679 --> 06:20.479
Mom, you just rattled off
a laundry list of things to do

06:20.581 --> 06:23.448
that actually included
doing the laundry.

06:23.550 --> 06:25.217
Well, that's
because I am busy.

06:25.319 --> 06:27.252
I'm not stressed.
And I like being busy.

06:27.354 --> 06:28.720
Even so,
you should come with us!

06:28.822 --> 06:31.123
It's fun, and plus,
kickboxing's a great workout.

06:31.225 --> 06:32.657
Okay, okay.

06:32.759 --> 06:34.393
It sounds like a "kick."

06:34.495 --> 06:37.796
And, besides, you girls
have kind of "boxed" me in.

06:43.303 --> 06:46.772
People are gonna be lining
up to hit her. Yeah.

06:50.677 --> 06:52.110
Hey.
What did I miss?

06:52.212 --> 06:54.012
Oh, a big
management lesson.

06:54.114 --> 06:57.582
Candice downstairs
had a bad cough, so I --

06:57.684 --> 07:00.185
I let her go home.

07:01.421 --> 07:02.487
Could have been Zika.

07:02.589 --> 07:04.523
I might have saved
hundreds of lives.

07:06.092 --> 07:07.692
Hey, you know,
I told my teacher

07:07.794 --> 07:08.660
about how you handled

07:08.762 --> 07:10.595
that Chuck and Joe thing
yesterday.

07:10.697 --> 07:12.297
Um, he said
you were wrong.

07:12.399 --> 07:14.499
Well, he is the face

07:14.601 --> 07:16.501
of 21 huge stores
across the Southwest.

07:16.603 --> 07:17.702
Oh, wait a minute.
No, that's not him.

07:17.804 --> 07:20.505
That's me.

07:20.607 --> 07:23.308
See, the textbook
outlines a four-step process

07:23.410 --> 07:25.277
for conflict resolution.

07:25.379 --> 07:26.778
You didn't do any of them.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.613
Because it's not
a four-step process.

07:28.715 --> 07:29.781
One step.

07:29.883 --> 07:31.616
Yell at them,
make fun of them,

07:31.718 --> 07:32.984
get them back to work.

07:33.086 --> 07:34.820
That would actually be
three steps.

07:34.922 --> 07:36.521
But shutting problems down
like that

07:36.623 --> 07:39.124
just allows them to fester
and grow below the surface.

07:39.226 --> 07:40.192
Well,
it's their surface,

07:41.295 --> 07:43.328
and I really don't want to
know what's...festering.

07:44.831 --> 07:46.465
Okay.

07:46.567 --> 07:48.533
Hey, guys.

07:48.635 --> 07:49.534
How's it going?

07:49.636 --> 07:51.369
Oh, great.

07:51.471 --> 07:52.571
Cronuts.

07:54.707 --> 07:55.974
Surface.

07:58.578 --> 08:02.547
Hey, um, so, is everything
actually great out here?

08:02.649 --> 08:03.682
Oh. Yeah.

08:03.784 --> 08:06.151
Didn't you hear me? Cronuts.
MANDY: Yeah.

08:06.253 --> 08:08.320
Yeah, I just feel like
maybe my dad

08:08.422 --> 08:09.488
shut you guys down
a little quickly

08:09.590 --> 08:11.156
with that whole
pitching thing.

08:11.258 --> 08:12.824
Yeah, but he always
does that.

08:12.926 --> 08:14.326
That's just his style.

08:14.428 --> 08:16.862
Baxter be Baxter.
(chuckles)

08:16.964 --> 08:19.498
But not all Baxters be Baxter,
you know?

08:19.600 --> 08:21.333
I for one believe
in a less authoritative

08:21.435 --> 08:22.701
management style.

08:22.803 --> 08:23.835
It's hard to imagine

08:23.937 --> 08:27.005
a more authoritative
management style.

08:27.107 --> 08:29.708
See, I'm of the Hopkins
school of thought

08:29.810 --> 08:33.445
that any employee conflict
can be easily resolved

08:33.547 --> 08:35.413
using a four-step
process.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.883
Check out the book-head
on her.

08:37.985 --> 08:40.285
(laughs)
I know, right?

08:40.387 --> 08:42.187
It's like I have all these
amazing thoughts, like,

08:42.289 --> 08:43.221
sloshing around up here,

08:43.323 --> 08:44.523
but nobody wants to
listen to me.

08:44.625 --> 08:47.559
It's like --
This must be how Jesus felt.

08:49.062 --> 08:51.229
Okay.

08:51.331 --> 08:53.899
So, what's your process?

08:54.001 --> 08:55.367
Oh, do you guys just
want to try it out?

08:55.469 --> 08:56.434
It could be fun in like

08:56.536 --> 08:58.436
a super-professional,
businessy way.

08:59.739 --> 09:02.474
Are we on the clock
while we're doing it?

09:02.576 --> 09:03.975
Sure.

09:04.077 --> 09:05.377
I'm in.
Yeah, all right.

09:05.479 --> 09:07.245
Me, too.
Why not?

09:09.282 --> 09:11.650
Oh, hang on.
Cronuts!

09:18.591 --> 09:20.225
Okay, so Step 1 --

09:20.327 --> 09:23.128
find a common goal.
Uh...

09:23.230 --> 09:25.730
You both want the team
to win, right?

09:25.832 --> 09:27.766
Yeah.
- Sure, why not?

09:27.868 --> 09:30.435
(gasps)

09:30.537 --> 09:33.004
Yay!
This is working super well!

09:33.106 --> 09:35.240
And since we want
the team to win,

09:35.342 --> 09:37.776
I should be pitcher
and Joe should, uh,

09:37.878 --> 09:39.811
bring snacks
like the Team Mom.

09:39.913 --> 09:42.247
Hey, if was the Team Mom,

09:42.349 --> 09:44.349
I'd be dropping you off
at the fire house right now.

09:44.451 --> 09:45.584
No. Okay. No, no.

09:45.686 --> 09:46.751
No, we're done with Step 1.

09:46.853 --> 09:48.787
Now we're onto Step 2.
Active listening.

09:48.889 --> 09:51.323
Now, uh, Joe,
I want you to listen

09:51.425 --> 09:53.258
while Chuck tells us
why he feels

09:53.360 --> 09:54.192
that he should be
the pitcher.

09:54.294 --> 09:56.861
Go ahead, Chuck.
Okay, well, it's simple.

09:56.963 --> 09:58.496
I'm a Marine.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.498
I'm battle-tested.

10:00.600 --> 10:04.102
When the pressure's on, I keep my cool.
- Mm-hmm.

10:04.204 --> 10:07.172
Not keeping your cool,
not cool.

10:09.308 --> 10:10.342
Okay.

10:10.444 --> 10:14.212
Joe, I hope that you were
listening actively

10:14.314 --> 10:16.815
because I want you to tell us
what you heard Chuck say.

10:16.917 --> 10:18.350
Okay, here's
what I heard, okay?

10:18.452 --> 10:20.285
"I'm a lousy pitcher,"
okay?

10:20.387 --> 10:21.486
"I was a soldier.

10:21.588 --> 10:23.355
Blah, blah, blah.
Support the troops.

10:23.457 --> 10:25.523
Blah, blah, blah.
I want to pitch.

10:25.625 --> 10:26.825
Not cool."

10:26.927 --> 10:28.193
Oh.

10:28.295 --> 10:29.361
You know what?

10:29.463 --> 10:31.529
At least I wouldn't be
napping between pitches.

10:31.631 --> 10:33.365
What's that supposed to mean?
Okay, no, no.

10:33.467 --> 10:35.166
Let's not ruin all that good
feeling we had after Step 1.

10:35.268 --> 10:36.968
Remember?
Those were the days, huh?

10:37.070 --> 10:38.236
I've seen you
on the security cameras!

10:38.338 --> 10:40.071
Pick up a wrench,
take a nap.

10:40.173 --> 10:41.840
Turn a bolt,
take a nap.

10:41.942 --> 10:43.074
Wake up from a nap,

10:43.176 --> 10:44.242
take a nap!

10:44.344 --> 10:45.644
Is that your job?

10:45.746 --> 10:48.513
You stare at a monitor
and watch people work?

10:48.615 --> 10:51.082
You know, you're
a professional creep, okay?

10:51.184 --> 10:53.318
The only thing
I've ever seen you work on

10:53.420 --> 10:54.719
is a sandwich.
All good points!

10:54.821 --> 10:56.755
Now, Chuck -- Hey, hey, I
have a condition, okay?

10:56.857 --> 10:58.556
I'm trying to regulate
my blood sugar.

10:58.658 --> 11:01.259
With ham?

11:01.361 --> 11:03.561
It helps! You know,
I'm out of here.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.363
No. I'm fed up.
No.

11:05.465 --> 11:06.765
Lose an argument,
take a nap!

11:06.867 --> 11:09.000
Okay!
Okay, great!

11:09.102 --> 11:10.201
We'll just take
a short little break,

11:10.303 --> 11:12.203
and then when we come back,
we'll do Step 3.

11:12.305 --> 11:14.339
No, we do not hit each other
with a stapler!

11:17.677 --> 11:19.678
Okay, and switch!

11:22.381 --> 11:23.715
Hyah!

11:23.817 --> 11:24.716
Hyah!

11:24.818 --> 11:27.719
Mom! Mom, nobody else
is saying "Hyah!"

11:27.821 --> 11:28.953
Yeah, I know,

11:29.055 --> 11:32.123
but everyone stared
when I yelled "Kung Fu!"

11:33.793 --> 11:35.760
Okay, fighters,
grab some water.

11:38.030 --> 11:39.197
(laughs)

11:39.299 --> 11:41.199
I am so glad you guys
got me to do this.

11:41.301 --> 11:45.537
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!
(laughs)

11:45.639 --> 11:47.906
(groans) She giggles when she kicks.
- Yeah.

11:48.008 --> 11:50.275
It's called repressed rage,
okay?

11:50.377 --> 11:52.077
She's gonna explode.

11:52.179 --> 11:54.646
You're right.
She's a ticking time bomb.

11:54.748 --> 11:56.548
I am not sparring
with her.

11:56.650 --> 11:57.649
I'm not afraid of Mom.

11:57.751 --> 11:58.950
She carries spiders
out of the house

11:59.052 --> 12:00.151
in a paper cup.

12:03.723 --> 12:05.757
Okay, fighters.

12:05.859 --> 12:07.325
Face your sparring partner.

12:07.427 --> 12:08.727
Eve, you're with me.
-Oh.

12:08.829 --> 12:10.161
Rematch?
Excellent.

12:10.263 --> 12:11.162
How's your knee?

12:11.264 --> 12:13.898
Awful,
but I'm on painkillers.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.767
Mm.

12:15.902 --> 12:18.470
So what you're saying is,
punch harder.

12:20.606 --> 12:21.506
Come on, Mom.
It's you and me.

12:21.608 --> 12:23.408
Let's go.
- Okay.

12:23.510 --> 12:25.910
In the words
of the Cowardly Lion,

12:26.012 --> 12:28.346
"Put 'em up,
put 'em up!"

12:29.448 --> 12:30.348
Come on, Mom.
Hit me. Come on.

12:30.450 --> 12:32.150
Okay! Okay.
Hyah!

12:32.252 --> 12:34.319
Ooh! You okay?
I'm sorry.

12:34.421 --> 12:36.287
Sorry. - Mom, do not apologize
for hitting me, okay?

12:36.389 --> 12:37.322
And that was a love tap.

12:37.424 --> 12:38.356
Come on.
That's 'cause I love you.

12:38.458 --> 12:41.092
What? No. Mom!
Stop.

12:41.194 --> 12:43.294
Come on, Mom.
Let the leather fly.

12:43.396 --> 12:44.629
You know you always wanted
to hit Kristin.

12:44.731 --> 12:45.964
I have not.

12:46.066 --> 12:47.098
Oh.

12:47.200 --> 12:48.933
Maybe it's just me.
(scoffs)

12:50.002 --> 12:51.936
Ow!
- Focus!

12:52.038 --> 12:53.538
Are you nuts?

12:53.640 --> 12:55.807
I'm just a little kid!
My mom's here!

12:57.777 --> 12:58.977
Mom, come on, come on! - Okay.

13:00.313 --> 13:00.378
Keep your hands up, okay? Yeah.
Yeah? All right, all right.

13:01.047 --> 13:01.379
Ow!
Ooh, that was hard!

13:01.914 --> 13:02.680
Hey!
No kicking!

13:02.782 --> 13:04.115
Mom,
it's called kickboxing.

13:04.217 --> 13:05.049
I don't care!

13:05.151 --> 13:07.352
Come on, hit me again!
Hit me again!

13:07.454 --> 13:08.720
No, harder!
I know you have it in you!

13:08.822 --> 13:10.355
Come on.
- Like this?

13:10.457 --> 13:12.157
No, like this!

13:15.194 --> 13:16.661
Oh, my God.

13:16.763 --> 13:19.531
We're gonna need
some of your painkillers.

13:30.009 --> 13:31.376
What the hell?

13:40.086 --> 13:41.886
Hey, Joe.

13:41.988 --> 13:43.087
Hey, Mandy.
Glad you're here.

13:43.189 --> 13:44.889
Hold this.
- Okay.

13:44.991 --> 13:46.891
Um, so, anyways...

13:46.993 --> 13:48.326
Yeah, I'm just checking
that you're okay

13:48.428 --> 13:50.361
and none of this
gets back to my father.

13:54.400 --> 13:56.201
What the hell?

14:00.539 --> 14:01.906
What are you doing?

14:02.008 --> 14:05.677
I'm putting peanut butter
on Chuck's security camera.

14:05.779 --> 14:06.911
Um, you know,

14:07.013 --> 14:09.447
I don't think you're supposed
to be doing that.

14:09.549 --> 14:10.682
Well, while you're looking
into it,

14:10.784 --> 14:12.383
I'm gonna keep working, okay?
- Okay.

14:12.485 --> 14:15.386
What do you -- What do you think
you're doing, Joe?

14:15.488 --> 14:18.089
Oh, Chuck, I'm sure
he's just joking around.

14:18.191 --> 14:21.259
Is it funny to compromise
the security of the store?

14:21.361 --> 14:24.028
All the cameras are blocked
from here to the loading dock!

14:24.130 --> 14:26.231
Well, I'm not comfortable
in front of a camera, okay?

14:26.333 --> 14:27.732
What can I say?
I'm, uh...

14:27.834 --> 14:29.767
I'm bashful.

14:29.869 --> 14:31.469
(laughs)

14:31.571 --> 14:33.371
The book says you're supposed
to be getting along by now.

14:33.473 --> 14:34.873
Give me
that toilet brush pole!

14:34.975 --> 14:36.241
No, this is
my toilet brush pole!

14:36.343 --> 14:38.042
Why hasn't anybody
read this book?

14:39.312 --> 14:41.479
Hey.
Larabee, what's going on?

14:41.581 --> 14:44.082
This guy put peanut butter
on my cameras.

14:44.184 --> 14:46.251
He put cameras
in my peanut butter!

14:47.286 --> 14:49.888
And unlike the great people
at Reese's,

14:49.990 --> 14:51.923
you guys have made a mess.
Stop! What's happening?

14:52.025 --> 14:53.892
It's just a little bit
of interpersonal conflict.

14:53.994 --> 14:54.893
Don't worry, I got it.

14:54.995 --> 14:56.461
What did you do?
I just wanted to make sure

14:56.563 --> 14:58.897
there was no festering
below the surface.

14:58.999 --> 15:00.798
They're not festering,
they're fighting.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.333
Right,
but they're not festering,

15:02.435 --> 15:04.502
so...yay!

15:11.344 --> 15:13.912
Hey, Mike Baxter here
for Outdoor Man.

15:14.014 --> 15:17.115
In addition to guns, camo,
skis, bows, knives,

15:17.217 --> 15:19.017
and more guns --

15:19.119 --> 15:20.852
it's a big store here
(chuckles) --

15:20.954 --> 15:22.353
we also sell books.

15:22.455 --> 15:24.088
That's right,
we carry a wide variety

15:24.190 --> 15:26.357
of reading materials
on climbing, exploring,

15:26.459 --> 15:28.426
hunting, camping,
fishing, camo --

15:28.528 --> 15:30.962
it's a big store.

15:31.064 --> 15:33.164
Look, we know even
when you're hiking, hunting,

15:33.266 --> 15:36.034
fishing, camping,
or just hanging outside --

15:36.136 --> 15:37.602
big store --

15:37.704 --> 15:40.104
eventually you'll need
the john

15:40.206 --> 15:43.041
and something to do
while you're sitting there.

15:43.143 --> 15:45.310
Some people prefer
learning from a book.

15:45.412 --> 15:47.879
Others like life lessons
from the real world.

15:47.981 --> 15:49.781
I order the swirl --

15:49.883 --> 15:51.149
both flavors.

15:51.251 --> 15:53.518
I read everything
I can get my hands on.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.486
Camille Paglia.
Dale Carnegie.

15:55.588 --> 15:57.655
Gavin de Becker.
Jack Welch.

15:57.757 --> 16:01.159
And even the Honey Nut
cereal box.

16:01.261 --> 16:05.229
I know, they're still cramming
a lot of Riboflavin in there.

16:05.331 --> 16:07.165
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

16:07.267 --> 16:10.568
C.S. Lewis said,
"Experience is a brutal teacher,

16:10.670 --> 16:13.371
but you'll learn,
by God, you'll learn."

16:13.473 --> 16:14.839
As opposed
to the fourth grade

16:14.941 --> 16:16.741
where Mr. Latham
was a brutal teacher,

16:16.843 --> 16:19.477
I didn't learn too much...

16:19.579 --> 16:21.813
except what the back
of a ruler felt like.

16:21.915 --> 16:22.981
(imitates ruler cracking)

16:23.083 --> 16:24.882
I was paying attention!

16:27.253 --> 16:29.520
But I've learned
an awful lot about business,

16:29.622 --> 16:32.690
about when to go by the book
and when to go with my gut.

16:32.792 --> 16:34.759
And I think you'll find
the more book learning

16:34.861 --> 16:35.893
you do about your trade,

16:35.995 --> 16:38.529
the more often your gut
is right.

16:38.631 --> 16:40.031
You know what,
and there's some things

16:40.133 --> 16:42.834
that can't be taught in a book.

16:42.936 --> 16:46.170
Like, ironically,
how to read a book.

16:51.410 --> 16:55.179
Oh, my God, Mom.
I am so, so, so sorry.

16:55.281 --> 16:56.681
Well, you should be.

16:56.783 --> 16:59.851
You hurt our poor, innocent
mother who gave us life.

16:59.953 --> 17:02.220
I was just trying to help her,
okay? And you agreed, okay?

17:02.322 --> 17:03.688
We both thought
she was going to explode!

17:03.790 --> 17:05.857
All right, girls.
Girls, stop.

17:05.959 --> 17:07.058
I am fine.

17:07.160 --> 17:09.360
Really.

17:09.462 --> 17:12.630
I mean, hey, why would
you think I'd explode?

17:12.732 --> 17:14.899
Uh, 'cause you never have.

17:15.001 --> 17:16.734
I mean, there's got to be
some rage lurking

17:16.836 --> 17:19.937
underneath that
eerily calm surface.

17:20.039 --> 17:22.440
Seriously, Mom. No one smiles
that much and means it.

17:22.542 --> 17:24.108
Well, I do!
Yeah, I do.

17:24.210 --> 17:25.543
I don't have untapped rage.

17:25.645 --> 17:26.744
I have a great life.

17:26.846 --> 17:29.213
Listen, if I got rage-y
about everything,

17:29.315 --> 17:30.915
that would make me
seem ungrateful

17:31.017 --> 17:31.916
and small-minded.

17:32.018 --> 17:33.084
Mm, you mean
like Kristin?

17:33.186 --> 17:34.619
Hey!
Watch it!

17:34.721 --> 17:35.820
Girls, look.

17:35.922 --> 17:37.288
Come on.
I had fun.

17:37.390 --> 17:38.556
I tried something new.

17:38.658 --> 17:41.392
I got to hang out
with my girls, and...

17:41.494 --> 17:44.595
I wasn't even unconscious
that long, but I --

17:44.697 --> 17:46.964
I feel so rested!
(chuckles)

17:48.000 --> 17:49.333
I feel awful.

17:49.435 --> 17:50.768
Oh, there you go.
There you go.

17:50.870 --> 17:51.769
Look.

17:51.871 --> 17:53.805
Honey, rage just isn't
my thing,

17:53.907 --> 17:56.174
but -- but guilt is.

17:57.409 --> 17:58.776
Love you.

17:58.878 --> 18:01.245
Even though you hurt me.

18:03.315 --> 18:05.283
Wow, wow, wow.
She just nailed you.

18:05.385 --> 18:06.451
Yeah.

18:06.553 --> 18:08.586
Now I really feel like
punching somebody.

18:08.688 --> 18:11.522
You know who I think
would enjoy kickboxing?

18:12.625 --> 18:14.625
Mandy.
- Mandy.

18:17.596 --> 18:19.330
I was just trying to demonstrate
how useless he is!

18:19.432 --> 18:20.465
Okay.

18:20.567 --> 18:22.133
Do you have me
on camera sleeping?

18:22.235 --> 18:25.770
Because I have you
on camera<i> sleeping!</i>

18:25.872 --> 18:27.505
Knock it off!

18:27.607 --> 18:29.006
The reason I didn't
have you pitching

18:29.108 --> 18:30.441
is because I wanted you
to work for it

18:30.543 --> 18:33.878
because you're lazy!

18:33.980 --> 18:36.981
He got me there.
- Yeah.

18:37.083 --> 18:38.449
But you could have named me
pitcher.

18:38.551 --> 18:40.051
That would have made him
work for it, too, right?

18:40.153 --> 18:41.686
You're a lousy pitcher!

18:41.788 --> 18:45.389
We beat Der Wienerschnitzel
by three runs.

18:45.491 --> 18:47.725
26 to 23.

18:47.827 --> 18:50.962
Okay, I'm not
a good pitcher.

18:51.064 --> 18:53.030
Cleared up.
Now let's get back to work.

18:53.132 --> 18:55.399
And get the peanut butter
off that damn camera down there!

18:55.501 --> 18:57.201
Can I just keep it
on the one in my area?

18:57.303 --> 18:58.236
That soft focus --

18:58.338 --> 18:59.637
I mean, it takes off
like 10 years,

18:59.739 --> 19:00.705
I can't believe it.

19:00.807 --> 19:02.640
Joe! - I'm going! I'm going!

19:04.510 --> 19:06.677
Okay, I know
that looked bad,

19:06.779 --> 19:08.479
but I was just trying
to get them to talk it out

19:08.581 --> 19:09.547
like my book said.

19:09.649 --> 19:10.915
You know, I can probably
find a book

19:11.017 --> 19:13.017
that will tell you everything
in that book is wrong.

19:13.119 --> 19:14.719
There's only one book
you have to follow

19:14.821 --> 19:16.754
word for word.
- The Bible.

19:16.856 --> 19:17.989
The Federal Tax Code.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.894
'Cause there's no
statute of limitations,

19:22.996 --> 19:26.430
and they will
chase you down.

19:27.833 --> 19:29.600
I think I see your point.
Books are stupid.

19:29.702 --> 19:31.402
No, no, no, no, no.
That's not what I'm saying.

19:31.504 --> 19:34.038
There's a lot of information
in books, great information,

19:34.140 --> 19:36.674
but you got to know
when to trust your gut.

19:36.776 --> 19:39.110
Okay, first of all,
I don't have a gut.

19:40.946 --> 19:42.613
And if I had one,
I wouldn't trust it.

19:42.715 --> 19:45.016
I'd be disgusted by it.

19:45.118 --> 19:47.018
There's two things
that make a great manager --

19:47.120 --> 19:48.619
all the knowledge
in those books

19:48.721 --> 19:52.690
and the experience to know
when to apply that knowledge.

19:52.792 --> 19:56.594
Yeah, and I guess I don't have
the experience yet, so...

19:56.696 --> 19:58.262
I shouldn't have butted in.

19:58.364 --> 19:59.964
Although I do trust
my butt.

20:00.066 --> 20:01.199
(chuckles)

20:01.301 --> 20:03.901
Doesn't happen overnight.
It takes some time.

20:04.003 --> 20:05.736
I wasn't always
this good at this.

20:05.838 --> 20:06.771
Yeah.

20:06.873 --> 20:08.306
But I got some experience
today, right?

20:08.408 --> 20:09.574
Yes, you did.
- You know?

20:09.676 --> 20:11.142
I think I finally understand
what they mean

20:11.244 --> 20:13.110
when they say, "You don't know
what you don't know

20:13.212 --> 20:14.579
until you don't know it."

20:14.681 --> 20:16.113
I didn't used to
know that.

20:18.217 --> 20:20.885
I'm not entirely sure
you do right now.

20:21.987 --> 20:23.120
Uh-oh.

20:23.222 --> 20:25.957
The big man
who scares bears.

20:26.059 --> 20:28.259
The straw really worked!

20:28.361 --> 20:30.161
No bear attacks.

20:30.263 --> 20:31.796
By the way,
I bumped into Chuck,

20:31.898 --> 20:34.665
and I made him
our new starting pitcher.

20:37.102 --> 20:38.836
Do you have to go
handle that?

20:38.938 --> 20:40.304
Yeah.

20:40.406 --> 20:43.007
This is why I can't deal
with ISIS.

20:49.281 --> 20:51.816
(squeals)
These are so cushy!

20:51.918 --> 20:53.951
Like, how do you even hurt
anybody with these things?

20:54.053 --> 20:55.253
Like this.
- Ow!

20:55.355 --> 20:56.687
And like this!
- Hey!

20:56.789 --> 20:57.989
Come on! You're gonna
leave a bruise!

20:58.091 --> 20:59.657
All right, come on!
Get mad at me, Mandy!

20:59.759 --> 21:02.360
I'm tougher than you,
I'm smarter than you.

21:02.462 --> 21:03.794
So what?

21:05.331 --> 21:07.131
My skin's three years younger
than yours.

21:07.233 --> 21:08.199
What?
How dare you?!

21:08.301 --> 21:09.267
Aah!

21:09.369 --> 21:11.035
(shouting)

21:11.137 --> 21:13.437
Whoo!

21:13.539 --> 21:16.107
Holy crap.
What the heck happened?

21:16.209 --> 21:17.708
Yeah!

21:17.810 --> 21:19.944
You want a piece of me?!

21:20.046 --> 21:22.513
Yeah!
This is my house now!

21:24.183 --> 21:27.618
(groans) Mandy has more anger
than we thought.
