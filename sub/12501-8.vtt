Oh, you should've seen Lynch lady.
Ooh, she was a real piece of ass.

00:17.652 --> 00:19.652
Whoa. Look at all this
cool stuff you can buy.

00:19.654 --> 00:23.022
X-ray glasses, spy pens, sea monkeys,

00:23.024 --> 00:25.358

for only two bucks?

00:25.360 --> 00:27.026
[chuckles] Oh, Malloy.

00:27.028 --> 00:28.928
It's all Novelty Bullshit
to trick little kids.

00:28.930 --> 00:30.596
None of that crap ever worked.

00:30.598 --> 00:32.432
This is America.

Morning, rangers. For
today's bonding exercise,

00:57.625 --> 00:59.659
I want each of you to
finish this sentence...

00:59.661 --> 01:02.962
- Connie is so ugly... 
- Her mirror went blind!

01:02.964 --> 01:05.698
Lena Dunham thinks
she looks gross naked.

01:05.700 --> 01:09.702
My dildo went limp.
[sighs] I hate these exercises.

01:09.704 --> 01:11.371
It's called "team building," Connie.

01:11.373 --> 01:14.040
As you know, this weekend
Brickleberry is hosting

01:14.042 --> 01:16.142
a regatta for super-rich yacht owners.

01:16.144 --> 01:19.045
It's my chance to suck
golden b-hole for a few days

01:19.047 --> 01:21.013

sure these rich people

01:26.187 --> 01:29.655
- How do we get rid of the poor people?
- God used Katrina.

01:29.657 --> 01:31.391
There's too many poor
people in this park to hide.

01:31.393 --> 01:33.159
They tube down the river every weekend.

01:33.161 --> 01:37.063
That's why you and Connie are
gonna dam it up with these.

Got 'em for a steal

01:40.068 --> 01:42.435
I don't know, Woody.
Those look radioactive.

01:42.437 --> 01:46.239
But if it wasn't for radiation,
you'd still be Bruce Banner.

01:46.241 --> 01:48.241
Steve, Ethel, take the helicopter

01:48.243 --> 01:50.610
and remove all the white-trash
trailers from the park.

01:50.612 --> 01:52.111
I can't go in the helicopter!

01:52.113 --> 01:55.948

- It's scary.

01:55.950 --> 01:57.750
Scarier than this?

I can kill a man in seven

02:01.055 --> 02:04.190
Okay! I'll go in the chopper!
 Just don't finger me!

02:04.192 --> 02:07.487
I loved that episode of Airwolf.

02:08.096 --> 02:11.197
So how exactly is a helicopter
going to get the trailers out?

02:11.199 --> 02:14.033
Woody bought this giant
Wile E. Coyote magnet.

You want me to fly this thing? 
Why can't you?

Two reasons... one, I lost
my license for flying drunk,

up in there, mister?

02:44.132 --> 02:48.167
No, I didn't just throw up.
I also shit myself.

02:48.169 --> 02:50.636
Ugh. Why ain't we moving?

02:50.638 --> 02:53.290
So last night when my girl
said she wanted to slip into

didn't know she meant a coma.

Hey, what's wrong with you?
That's funny.

I mean, it's sad, too, 'cause she died.

to have anxiety issues too.

Yep. I had claustrophobia, agoraphobia,

- and a constant fear of mortality.
- And I used to [bleep] goats.

in Chinatown who cured us.

04:50.358 --> 04:52.558

when he cut off your fingers,

08:43.546 --> 08:46.047

As head of the yachting
association, I have to say,

08:54.190 --> 08:56.824
if the regatta comes out
nearly as well as this party,

08:56.826 --> 08:59.026
I want you to join us
next year in Australia.

Yeah. Dead-eyed fatties 
turn me on so hard.

09:10.840 --> 09:13.007
- See? I told you.
- Well, if she were my date,

09:13.009 --> 09:14.876
I couldn't keep my hands off her.

09:14.878 --> 09:16.244
Oh, yeah? Well, go ahead.

09:16.246 --> 09:18.045
Give them sweater stretchers a squeeze.

09:18.047 --> 09:20.181
- She don't care.
- I do care!

09:20.183 --> 09:21.916
Well, as long as she doesn't care...

09:21.918 --> 09:24.151
Hands off her, ye mangy bilge rat!

09:24.153 --> 09:26.220
God damn it, it's Pirate Steve!

- I am now.

09:33.830 --> 09:36.264
The cost of that lesson
be yer gold piece.

09:36.266 --> 09:39.400
Till we meet again.
Mwah.

09:39.402 --> 09:41.002
<i>Hiya! Hee-ha!
Hee-ha!</i>

09:41.004 --> 09:43.838
<i>Hiya! Hee-ha!
Hee-ha! Hiya! Hee!</i>

09:43.840 --> 09:46.206
How the hell does he do that?

09:47.042 --> 09:49.577
Hear this, me hearties!
 I need a crew.

09:49.579 --> 09:52.346
The tyrant Woody and his
scourge of entitled imperialists

09:52.348 --> 09:55.116
are endeavoring to rid
this fair land of its poor,

09:55.118 --> 09:58.920
so it be our duty to rid
them of their fineries!

09:58.922 --> 10:01.022
- What'd he say?
- He said we must prey

10:01.024 --> 10:03.057
upon the golden galleons
of the oppressor, Bobby.

10:03.059 --> 10:06.193
Oh, okay. Do we get to rape?

10:06.195 --> 10:08.529
Alas, pirates don't rape anymore.

10:08.531 --> 10:10.197
- Aw.
- Oh, man.

10:10.199 --> 10:12.400
Except for the last
Pirates of the Caribbean,

10:12.402 --> 10:15.536
which raped the eyes of the audience.

10:15.538 --> 10:17.471
Well, at least we get to pillage!

10:17.473 --> 10:19.106
Aye. Are ye with me?

10:19.108 --> 10:20.975
- Yeah!
- Hell, yeah!

10:20.977 --> 10:24.211
Hobo Larry raped 
a warm can of beans once.

10:24.213 --> 10:27.521
Yep, I was porkin' beans.

10:30.452 --> 10:33.587
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Pirates, yeah!

10:33.589 --> 10:35.623
[all cheering]

10:36.992 --> 10:38.559
Aah!

10:38.561 --> 10:40.127
Jim, you goddamn son of a bitch!

10:40.129 --> 10:41.996
Where are you mother[bleep] taking me?

10:41.998 --> 10:44.298
Jim!

10:52.140 --> 10:56.944
- For ye, me lovely.
- Oh, Captain Steve, it's beautiful.

10:56.946 --> 11:01.248
- Hey, that's my diamond necklace!
- Ye son of a bitch!

11:01.250 --> 11:03.184
If anyone asks who just robbed ye,

11:03.186 --> 11:05.586
tell 'em Captain Steve.

11:05.588 --> 11:08.122
And don't take it personal
that we didn't rape y'all.

11:08.124 --> 11:09.824
We're trying to cut back.

11:11.259 --> 11:12.994
You're amazing!

11:12.996 --> 11:17.198
Wait. Hmm.
Only a one-inch thigh gap.

11:17.200 --> 11:20.267
- Next!
- Damn, Connie, why you being so picky?

11:20.269 --> 11:22.203
I only have one hymen, Denzel.

11:22.205 --> 11:23.704
Well, we're running out of girls,

11:23.706 --> 11:25.673
so you better hurry
up and choose a cooz.

11:25.675 --> 11:28.542
Don't worry. I'll know when
the right one comes along.

11:28.544 --> 11:31.312
All right. Next we have Alexa.

11:31.314 --> 11:34.348
[sultry music]

11:37.954 --> 11:39.854
Connie, are you okay?

11:39.856 --> 11:41.222
[moans]

11:41.224 --> 11:43.257
Lift your loincloth, please.

11:44.459 --> 11:48.896
It's perfect.
Like a rose made of prosciutto.

11:50.132 --> 11:53.101
Malloy, those rich pole
smokers are crawling up my ass

11:53.102 --> 11:56.070
about Steve and his thieving
band of salty shit-dogs.

11:56.072 --> 11:58.072
I got to get him and his
stupid ship out of here!

11:58.074 --> 12:01.175
Why don't we blow it up
with this Polaris nuclear sub?

12:01.177 --> 12:04.578
It fires real torpedoes,
and it's only $6.98!

12:04.580 --> 12:07.081
It's made of [bleep]
cardboard, Malloy!

12:07.083 --> 12:09.083
[distant explosion]

12:09.085 --> 12:11.152
What the hell was that?

12:11.154 --> 12:12.887
Holy shit.

12:12.889 --> 12:14.722
<i>Whoo!
[laughter]</i>

12:14.724 --> 12:17.391
You blew up my house,
you crazy son of a bitch!

12:17.393 --> 12:21.328
Please... 
accept this as my apology.

12:21.330 --> 12:22.329
Uh-oh.

12:22.331 --> 12:24.165
Aah!

12:24.167 --> 12:27.835
Oh, god. What am I gonna do?
[knock at door]

12:27.837 --> 12:29.003
[gong sounds]

12:29.005 --> 12:30.571
We here for reward.

12:30.573 --> 12:32.440
- Are any of you a hypnotist?
- No.

12:32.442 --> 12:34.375
<i>- No, not me.
- No, no, no.</i>

12:34.377 --> 12:35.943
<i>I sell mogwais.</i>

12:35.945 --> 12:37.411
Get the hell out of here!

12:37.413 --> 12:39.713
What am I supposed to
do with a Chinese army?

12:39.715 --> 12:42.016
Oh, holy Shanghai, that's it!

12:42.018 --> 12:45.252
If Steve wants to play
pirate, we'll play pirate.

12:45.254 --> 12:47.254
Pirate? We can't fly a "prane."

12:47.256 --> 12:49.957
So you even hear with an accent?

12:51.259 --> 12:53.694
Mmm. Alexa.

12:53.696 --> 12:56.030
Mmm. Prosciutto.

12:56.032 --> 12:58.032
Connie, wake up! It's me!

12:58.034 --> 13:00.134
I'm gonna sneak down to the
beach while everyone's asleep

13:00.136 --> 13:02.903
- and build a raft to escape.
- You're leaving? Why?

13:02.905 --> 13:04.705
There's something
weird going on here.

13:04.707 --> 13:06.740
- I think we might be in danger.
- You're just jealous

13:06.742 --> 13:09.376
because now I'm beautiful
and you're the ugly one.

13:09.378 --> 13:11.112
Look, whatever! I'm out of here!

13:11.114 --> 13:12.646
Fine!

13:12.648 --> 13:15.649
Wait, Denzel. Can you
give this to Alexa for me?

13:15.651 --> 13:17.651
I've taken up whittling.

13:20.956 --> 13:23.224
Hey, you're a man!
What's a man doin...

13:23.226 --> 13:26.127
♪ yo, ho, ho, and a bottle of rum ♪

13:26.129 --> 13:29.130
♪ let's swing by the zoo, 
I need to get some ♪

13:29.132 --> 13:31.932
[laughter]

13:31.934 --> 13:35.336
I love being a pirate!
I can finally wipe myself!

13:36.771 --> 13:38.606
Can somebody drive me to the hospital?

13:38.608 --> 13:42.143
[laughter]

13:42.145 --> 13:44.078
Everybody grab a ginsu.

13:46.014 --> 13:47.648
What the... ?

13:47.650 --> 13:50.451
[grunting]

13:50.453 --> 13:53.587
Uh, anybody want some beans?

13:53.589 --> 13:55.789
[laughs] 
Looking for someone?

13:55.791 --> 13:59.593
Hey, dumbass, nice ambush.
We outnumber you three to one.

13:59.595 --> 14:01.262
<i>Aah!
 [thud]</i>

14:01.264 --> 14:03.631
Then I'd say the odds
are squarely in our favor.

14:03.633 --> 14:05.866
Right, mateys?

14:05.868 --> 14:07.434
Mwah.

14:07.436 --> 14:10.671
[all shouting]

14:12.607 --> 14:15.943
Now it's just ye and me.

14:20.715 --> 14:22.483
Get him, Captain Steve!

14:22.485 --> 14:27.955
- Now walk the plank, fatscallion.
- Good-bye, cruel world!

14:27.957 --> 14:31.125
[bones crack] Ow!
I broke my goddamn ankles!

14:32.160 --> 14:34.495
And now for me reward.

14:34.497 --> 14:38.299
[burbling]

14:38.301 --> 14:40.634
You're so brave, Captain Steve.

14:40.636 --> 14:42.636
You should come by my cabin later.

14:42.638 --> 14:46.307
[chuckles] Looks like I found
a chink in his armor.

14:46.309 --> 14:49.577
- Hey, what the hell?
- Figure of speech... don't get offended.

14:52.147 --> 14:53.814
[groaning]

14:53.816 --> 14:55.015
Blimey!

14:55.017 --> 14:56.350
Aah!

14:56.352 --> 14:58.152
[harp music]

14:59.187 --> 15:03.424
One free fluff and fold?
Oh! [grunts]

15:03.426 --> 15:05.993
Where am I? 
Why am I upside down?

15:05.995 --> 15:11.265
Captain Steve, your pirate ass is
about to be [bleep] in the bunghole.

15:11.267 --> 15:13.955
So this is what you freaks
do when I'm not around?

15:15.272 --> 15:17.406
You built a sex dungeon
under your cabin?

15:17.408 --> 15:19.909
Well, it's a lot more
practical than a basement.

15:19.911 --> 15:22.812
And if I ever need a regular dungeon,
I just take out the dildos.

15:22.814 --> 15:24.413
But why are you locking me up?

15:24.415 --> 15:27.082
Because I need this
regatta to go well,

15:27.084 --> 15:29.585
and I can't have Captain
Steve running around

15:29.587 --> 15:32.822
- like a crazy [bleep] pirate!
- I was a pirate?

15:32.824 --> 15:34.557
Get in there.

15:34.559 --> 15:36.892
Hilda, it's your lucky day.
You're free to go.

15:36.894 --> 15:40.229
I can really go, just
like that after 12 years?

15:40.231 --> 15:44.233
Hilda, don't let this
experience define you.

15:45.335 --> 15:46.969
You're just in time to enter

15:46.971 --> 15:49.872
the wonderful world
of amazing sea monkeys.

15:52.242 --> 15:54.777
That's it? It doesn't
look anything like the box.

15:54.779 --> 15:58.781
- Malloy, I-I tried to tell you.
- You know what the worst part is?

15:58.783 --> 16:00.449
That you were actually right
about something for once.

16:00.451 --> 16:02.818
This stuff is bullshit.

16:02.820 --> 16:04.653
[toilet flushes]

16:10.293 --> 16:12.828
And now, my wealthy
friends with vacation homes

16:12.830 --> 16:16.465
in places I would like to visit,
the moment we've been waiting for...

16:16.467 --> 16:18.334
<i>the Brickleberry regatta!</i>

16:18.336 --> 16:20.503
<i>On your mark, get set... </i>

16:20.505 --> 16:21.937

[regal music]

16:25.543 --> 16:27.843
[roaring]

16:27.845 --> 16:29.845
- What the hell?
- Holy shit!

16:29.847 --> 16:32.982
It does look like the box!
I told you this stuff works!

16:32.984 --> 16:36.385
[roaring]

16:36.387 --> 16:38.153
Face it, Woody... 
there's only one hero

16:38.155 --> 16:40.289
brave enough to fight this monster.

16:40.291 --> 16:43.362
- Klan Man?
- Captain Steve!

16:44.895 --> 16:47.563
Please! Y'all can't
do this to Connie!

16:47.565 --> 16:50.566
[tribal music]

16:50.568 --> 16:53.969
Are you ready to mate
with your chosen one?

16:53.971 --> 16:57.339
What do you think?
 I'm leaving a snail trail.

16:57.341 --> 16:58.541
Aah!

17:00.076 --> 17:02.011
Oh, my god.

17:02.013 --> 17:04.413
Are you ready for me, Connie?

17:04.415 --> 17:06.848
- Uh-huh.
- Come here.

17:06.851 --> 17:09.885
[sultry music]

17:11.556 --> 17:12.855
[moans]

17:12.857 --> 17:16.392
- I can't.
- What?! Why not?

17:16.394 --> 17:18.327
Because...

17:18.329 --> 17:21.829
<i>All: You're... so... ugly!</i>

17:21.832 --> 17:24.366
That's right, Connie.
This is "You're so ugly!"

17:24.367 --> 17:27.102
The reality show that
humiliates unattractive people!

17:27.104 --> 17:28.737
- But... 
- We were going to punk

17:28.739 --> 17:31.006
some other beast, but
then you washed up onshore,

17:31.008 --> 17:32.875
and we couldn't believe our luck.

17:32.877 --> 17:34.877
You mean I'm not
having sex with Alexa?

17:34.879 --> 17:37.613
[laughter]

17:37.615 --> 17:40.182
Oh, come on, did you really
think someone like you

17:40.184 --> 17:41.784
could get someone like her?

17:41.786 --> 17:44.053
Sorry, Connie. I couldn't
stop these sick bastards.

17:44.055 --> 17:47.056
"Sick"? Hey, we're just
giving America what it wants.

17:47.058 --> 17:49.258
Nothing gets ratings
like degrading people,

17:49.260 --> 17:52.027
especially a hideous,
trout-faced monster like Connie.

17:52.029 --> 17:53.395
Am I right, ladies?

17:53.397 --> 17:55.064
<i>All: Yeah!</i>

17:55.066 --> 17:56.231
Oh.

17:56.233 --> 17:59.268
[roaring]

17:59.270 --> 18:01.804
- There it is!
- Holy shit!

18:01.806 --> 18:04.440
- What is that?
- It's the sea monster!

18:04.442 --> 18:07.810
You said "sea monkey."
I was planning to overfeed it to death.

18:07.812 --> 18:09.979
- I can't fight that thing.
- Sure you can.

18:09.981 --> 18:12.314
You're Captain Steve,
the fearless pirate.

18:12.316 --> 18:13.983
[people scream]

18:13.985 --> 18:16.603
Ethel, the truth is, I
was only fearless because

18:16.604 --> 18:19.221
a hypnotist put a
medallion around my neck.

18:19.223 --> 18:21.890
Without that, I'm nothing.

18:21.892 --> 18:24.326
No, Steve, the medallion
didn't do brave things.

18:24.328 --> 18:28.797
You did.
Now it's time to believe in yoursel...

18:28.799 --> 18:32.134
<i>Aah! 
Help, Steve! Help!</i>

18:32.136 --> 18:35.437
Aah! Raaah!

18:35.439 --> 18:37.339
You're in no danger!
[splat]

18:37.341 --> 18:40.075
This is all part of the entertainment!
[splat]

18:40.077 --> 18:42.162
Great special effects, huh?

18:43.348 --> 18:46.350
[roaring]
Shi-i-i-it!

18:47.519 --> 18:50.120
[screams] Help!

18:50.122 --> 18:53.157
[helicopter blades whirring]

18:53.159 --> 18:55.159
Steve, I knew you were brave.

18:55.161 --> 18:57.262
[crying]

18:57.263 --> 19:01.365
I'm gonna die.
I'm gonna die!

19:01.367 --> 19:03.133
[roars]

19:04.904 --> 19:07.371
[war cry]
[roars]

19:07.373 --> 19:09.373
Ah, bad idea!

19:11.176 --> 19:12.977
Yes!
I got to order more of these!

19:12.979 --> 19:14.378
Ahh!

19:14.380 --> 19:16.480
Hey, Captain Steve!
What's up?

19:16.482 --> 19:19.650
Men, you're alive!
I'm gonna get you out of here.

19:19.652 --> 19:21.385
- No, we like it here.
- What?

19:21.387 --> 19:22.820
In the last two minutes,

19:22.822 --> 19:25.256
we formed our own
little utopian society.

19:25.258 --> 19:27.925
It's like the 4-H
club with less [bleep]!

19:27.927 --> 19:29.493
Guys, if we don't get out,

19:29.495 --> 19:31.862
the stomach acid will
eat through our skin.

19:31.864 --> 19:33.898
Well, that explains the skeleton foot.

19:33.900 --> 19:36.233
I've got it!
Everybody get on the cannon.

19:36.235 --> 19:38.068
Aye, aye, captain.

19:39.738 --> 19:41.739
Oh!

19:42.707 --> 19:45.776
[all screaming]

19:47.379 --> 19:49.280
[growls]

19:51.716 --> 19:55.386
Steve, that was so brave!
I can't believe you survived.

19:55.388 --> 19:59.189
Oh, my god, you're right.
I almost died!

19:59.191 --> 20:00.691
[crying hysterically]

20:00.693 --> 20:02.826
[retches]

20:05.563 --> 20:07.631
At least we can have sex now.

20:07.633 --> 20:09.934
[coughs]

20:09.936 --> 20:12.136
I'm sorry I ever
called you ugly, Connie.

20:12.138 --> 20:15.572
That's okay. At least you
tried to look out for me.

20:15.574 --> 20:20.844
- Hey, do you think I overreacted?
- No.

20:23.548 --> 20:24.982
[flies buzzing]

20:24.984 --> 20:27.251
Poor Jim didn't make it out alive.

20:27.253 --> 20:30.321
[gurgling, flatulence]

20:30.323 --> 20:33.724
Again! Again! That's better
than [bleep] six flags!

20:33.726 --> 20:35.459
Screw those rich bastards.

20:35.461 --> 20:39.430
If we can't keep the
poor out, let 'em pour in.

20:39.432 --> 20:41.732
Argh!
Step right up, ye poor people!

20:41.734 --> 20:43.934
Ride the Sunken Monkey!

20:45.091 --> 20:46.860
[flatulence]

20:51.166 --> 20:54.502
