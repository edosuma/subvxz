I got barbecued?

It's never your fault.
It wasn't with Grodd

It's called a time fissure.

the normal flow of time.

The fire hydrant!

02:51.304 --> 02:52.938
Excuse me.

02:52.973 --> 02:55.607
During the fight, I saw
a fire hydrant vanish.

02:55.642 --> 02:59.144
Deleted objects are often
a sign of the time stream
trying to repair damage.

02:59.179 --> 03:00.312
Should I be worried?

03:00.347 --> 03:02.347
Normally, no...

03:02.382 --> 03:04.716
But this doesn't seem
like a normal time fissure.

Otherwise, you'll have

BOOSTER GOLD: A Chronovore.
It feeds on time energy.

Simple. We find

remove the crystal
from inside,
and it's all good.

05:17.951 --> 05:20.518
Just one problem.
We can't make contact with it.

100 years in a few seconds.
