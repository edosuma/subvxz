WEBVTT

00:25.859 --> 00:26.944
Fucking hell.

00:29.863 --> 00:31.156
All right, let's go.

00:31.156 --> 00:32.573
It's 4:00 a.m.

00:32.573 --> 00:34.701
Yeah. We start at 4:00 a.m.

00:34.701 --> 00:35.911
I thought you were joking.

00:35.911 --> 00:37.162
How is that a joke?

00:37.162 --> 00:38.580
'Cause it's 4:00 a.m.

00:39.581 --> 00:42.835
We start at 4:00, so you can do
three workouts a day instead of two.

00:43.836 --> 00:46.296
Okay, but it's 4:00 a.m.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.590
Do you wanna be better than Zava or not?

00:50.676 --> 00:52.719
Well, how are we gonna see? It's dark out.

00:54.721 --> 00:56.431
Fucking hell.

00:56.932 --> 00:59.560
Now get dressed.
Or I start flicking your balls.

01:00.811 --> 01:01.854
This is perverse.

01:34.720 --> 01:35.721
Whoops.

01:51.403 --> 01:52.529
There you go.

02:06.293 --> 02:07.669
Good morning, Sassy Smurf.

02:09.295 --> 02:11.173
Good morning, Marlboro Man.

02:12.007 --> 02:14.218
You know, you snored all night.

02:15.093 --> 02:16.178
I'm sorry about that.

02:16.678 --> 02:18.764
That's all right.
It's actually very soothing.

02:18.764 --> 02:20.057
Sounded like the sea.

02:20.057 --> 02:22.768
Well, I'm glad
you didn't hear any boat horns,

02:22.768 --> 02:25.604
given all the fried yams I ate last night.

02:30.943 --> 02:34.446
Hey, I was thinking.
We have a good time together, yeah?

02:34.446 --> 02:37.157
They're called simultaneous orgasms,
Ted, yes.

02:37.866 --> 02:39.743
Yeah, well, but I mean

02:39.743 --> 02:43.247
also all the talking and laughing
and all that stuff. Yeah?

02:43.247 --> 02:46.500
Sure.
Well, apart from all your dreadful puns.

02:47.376 --> 02:48.752
Right. Well, it's tough.

02:48.752 --> 02:51.797
Sometimes I just see 'em there,
and I gotta take a swing at 'em, you know?

02:52.881 --> 02:55.634
No, I-- Well, what I'm getting at is...

02:58.262 --> 02:59.930
Well, I was just thinking maybe...

03:01.181 --> 03:03.308
we could go on an actual date sometime.

03:04.101 --> 03:05.769
You know? You and me, together.

03:07.604 --> 03:08.814
God, no.

03:10.357 --> 03:12.442
Well, I appreciate you taking the time
to consider it.

03:12.442 --> 03:14.736
Ted, we can't date.

03:14.736 --> 03:15.737
Why not?

03:16.530 --> 03:19.074
- You're a mess.
- I'm a mess?

03:19.658 --> 03:20.701
Course you are.

03:20.701 --> 03:24.162
I'm a mess too, but I'm a mess
three years further on than you,

03:24.162 --> 03:26.582
so I'm more of a slight disarray.

03:26.582 --> 03:28.792
More like a slight disarray of sunshine,
if you ask me.

03:28.792 --> 03:30.210
Oh, God.

03:30.210 --> 03:33.839
- Sorry.
- Ted, on the day my ex got remarried,

03:33.839 --> 03:36.675
I drank a bottle of red wine
through a straw

03:37.426 --> 03:39.887
and told my Uber driver
I was in love with him.

03:39.887 --> 03:43.682
Then, when he dropped me home,
I puked so much,

03:43.682 --> 03:46.768
my mouth was like an elevator
from the goddamn Shining.

03:47.436 --> 03:49.646
Knocked my rating down to a 3.9.

03:49.646 --> 03:50.939
3.9?

03:51.982 --> 03:54.151
Fuck you. Why? What's yours?

03:55.819 --> 03:58.197
Oh, God, you're a five, aren't you?

03:59.156 --> 04:01.742
Course you're a five.
How the fuck are you a five?

04:01.742 --> 04:04.703
I don't know. I'm tidy.
I say "Please" and "Thank you."

04:04.703 --> 04:06.788
Sometimes I offer to drive
if they look tired.

04:08.373 --> 04:10.417
You are such a mess.

04:13.670 --> 04:16.380
Ted, I like our status.

04:18.257 --> 04:22.012
Friends with benefits,
like Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher.

04:22.596 --> 04:25.224
No.
I think you're thinking of 2011's other

04:25.224 --> 04:27.392
good-friends-turned-casual-lovers
based rom-com.

04:29.937 --> 04:30.771
No Strings Attached.

04:31.605 --> 04:34.650
Friends with Benefits
was Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake.

04:35.234 --> 04:38.237
Wow. 2011, friends be fuckin'.

04:38.237 --> 04:39.363
Yeah.

04:39.363 --> 04:42.449
So, let's keep things 2011.
Cool and breezy.

04:42.950 --> 04:44.326
Like an Arab Spring.

04:49.206 --> 04:51.124
And good luck
against West Ham this weekend.

04:51.750 --> 04:52.751
Fuck Rupert

04:52.751 --> 04:56.046
and that shriveled raisin-pouch
he calls a nutsack.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.146
Hello! Here for Flo?

05:13.146 --> 05:14.940
- You can jump in, love.
- Lovely, thank you.

05:16.066 --> 05:18.819
This is nice. Gray seats? Yes, please.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.863
<i>...West Ham. This is the real opportunity</i>

05:20.863 --> 05:22.573
<i>for the Wonder Kid
to become the Wonder Man...</i>

05:22.573 --> 05:24.074
101.

05:25.409 --> 05:26.410
100.

05:26.910 --> 05:28.996
Ninety-nine.

05:33.542 --> 05:35.127
Why do you only sleep with a top on?

05:36.879 --> 05:39.006
Because I get cold upstairs
and hot downstairs.

05:40.132 --> 05:41.133
I get that.

05:44.469 --> 05:45.721
Mornin'.

06:08.368 --> 06:10.120
Listen to what Rupert said in this one.

06:10.120 --> 06:14.041
"I truly look forward
to seeing my old club again.

06:14.041 --> 06:16.335
Richmond are top-class."

06:16.919 --> 06:19.588
- What a soggy, wet piece of shit.
- Thank you.

06:20.881 --> 06:24.801
Right, I'm off to the training ground.
Thanks again for the opportunity.

06:25.385 --> 06:27.846
Babe, you earned it.

06:27.846 --> 06:31.058
Shandy came up with
this super fun Bantr promo.

06:31.058 --> 06:33.185
It uses all the single players
on the team.

06:33.185 --> 06:34.436
Yeah.

06:34.436 --> 06:38.524
The anonymous man you're Bantr-ing with
could be a professional footballer.

06:39.983 --> 06:41.818
That's great.

06:41.818 --> 06:44.613
And that's all the single players,
you say?

06:44.613 --> 06:48.700
So, it's, like,
Colin and Dani and Sam, et cetera?

06:48.700 --> 06:50.953
Yeah, although I don't think
Sam's doing it anymore.

06:51.912 --> 06:54.373
- No.
- So fun.

06:56.208 --> 06:58.168
- Ms. Jones.
- Hello, Barbara.

06:58.168 --> 07:00.128
- All right there, Barbs?
- It's "Barbara."

06:58.252 --> 07:00.128
- All right there, Barbs?
- It's "Barbara."

07:00.796 --> 07:04.925
If possible, could I get two tickets
for the Richmond-West Ham match?

07:04.925 --> 07:07.052
Jack might be coming to London
this weekend.

07:07.052 --> 07:08.303
Of course.

07:09.763 --> 07:10.764
Who's Jack?

07:12.683 --> 07:13.600
Jack Danvers.

07:14.977 --> 07:18.105
The head of the VC
that funded your company.

07:19.231 --> 07:20.691
Our boss.

07:23.318 --> 07:27.030
Yes. That Jack. Of course.

07:28.240 --> 07:29.908
That's not a problem, Barbara.

07:30.659 --> 07:32.703
I can let you have some seats in my suite.

07:34.496 --> 07:35.497
Lovely.

07:35.497 --> 07:38.750
Thank you so much, Rebecca.
That's so kind of you and so efficient.

07:41.420 --> 07:42.254
Keeley.

07:44.840 --> 07:46.300
Thanks, Barbara.

07:48.760 --> 07:52.931
So, the one thing we cannot do
against West Ham is the False Nine.

07:52.931 --> 07:54.892
- 'Cause that's Nate's shit.
- Exactly.

07:54.892 --> 07:57.269
So, we decided to go with
our classic 4-4-2.

07:57.269 --> 07:59.521
Which is exactly what
that prick expects us to do.

07:59.521 --> 08:02.399
So, we do the opposite.
Five up front. Full-on attack.

07:59.605 --> 08:02.399
So, we do the opposite.
Five up front. Full-on attack.

08:02.399 --> 08:05.944
But Nate knows we're gonna do that,

08:05.944 --> 08:09.990
because Nate knows that we're trying to
outthink him by thinking like him.

08:10.824 --> 08:14.786
Well, fuck Nate, fuck thinking
and fuck fucking Socrates.

08:14.786 --> 08:17.122
So, we gotta stop thinking like Nate
and start thinking

08:17.122 --> 08:19.917
like Nate would think we would think
if Nate were thinking like us,

08:19.917 --> 08:22.085
and then do the last thing
that Nate thinking like us

08:22.085 --> 08:25.172
thinking like Nate thinking like us
would ever expect us to do.

08:26.089 --> 08:30.677
Have Zava drop back
and play Nate's False Nine.

08:30.677 --> 08:31.970
Voi-fucking-lÃ .

08:33.096 --> 08:34.222
Brilliant.

08:34.222 --> 08:36.475
- It's mostly Beard's idea.
- Nah, it was a group effort.

08:36.475 --> 08:37.601
I do have one question.

08:37.601 --> 08:38.977
- Of course.
- Who fucking cares?

08:40.270 --> 08:41.813
Do you think Zava'll do it?

08:48.737 --> 08:49.863
Fuck!

08:51.573 --> 08:53.158
- Good mornin'.
- Hey.

08:55.118 --> 08:57.871
- Uh-oh, what's wrong?
- Roy doesn't think we can beat Nate.

08:57.871 --> 09:01.667
- Higgins doesn't think so either!
- Beard said it to me first.

08:57.955 --> 09:01.667
- Higgins doesn't think so either!
- Beard said it to me first.

09:01.667 --> 09:04.795
- You throw me under the bus? How dare--
- You walked in here this morning--

09:04.795 --> 09:08.257
- You're gonna sell me out?
- Whoa! Whoa.

09:08.257 --> 09:11.093
Y'all pointin' more fingers
than Ganesha givin' directions.

09:11.093 --> 09:14.596
Now look, you fellas need to calm down
and just kiss.

09:17.224 --> 09:18.225
He's right.

09:20.352 --> 09:21.687
Keep it simple, smartypants.

09:22.479 --> 09:24.439
An answer will show up. Don't worry.

09:25.107 --> 09:29.403
But until it does,
here's a question for y'all: Am I a mess?

09:32.322 --> 09:34.908
Sassy ended up
spending the night last night and--

09:35.492 --> 09:38.287
No, hush your butts.
That ain't the headline.

09:38.287 --> 09:40.455
Well, I asked her out
on a proper date this morning.

09:40.455 --> 09:44.668
She turned me down cold. She said I was--
and I quote-- "a mess."

09:46.587 --> 09:51.383
- Yeah.
- Sounds like a case for the Diamond Dogs!

09:51.383 --> 09:52.843
Release the hounds.

09:52.843 --> 09:55.053
Yeah, here we go! Let's do it.

09:59.057 --> 10:00.893
Fuck's sakes.

10:05.898 --> 10:06.732
Yes.

10:07.816 --> 10:09.651
-"Yes" what?
- Yes, you're a mess.

10:09.651 --> 10:11.486
Okay. Expound.

10:11.486 --> 10:12.696
We're playing Nate this week,

10:12.696 --> 10:14.323
and you're acting like
it's not a big deal.

10:15.199 --> 10:16.867
Nothing's different. He didn't hurt you.

10:16.867 --> 10:18.827
Hey, look,
we ain't talking about Nate right now.

10:18.827 --> 10:21.914
I'm asking you if you think I'm a mess.
All right?

10:21.914 --> 10:23.081
Higgy pie, what do you think?

10:23.081 --> 10:26.919
I think I don't understand
how you're not pissed off with Nate.

10:28.295 --> 10:30.714
We have a saying
in Co-Dependents Anonymous.

10:30.714 --> 10:33.509
- Y-- What?
- Jane makes me go with her.

10:34.092 --> 10:35.344
Yeah.

10:35.344 --> 10:36.887
Pain is like carbon monoxide.

10:37.429 --> 10:40.891
Expressing it to the person
who hurt you is like opening a vent,

10:40.891 --> 10:43.185
but holding it in will poison you.

10:44.144 --> 10:46.772
I like that.
But Nate didn't hurt me.

10:46.772 --> 10:47.940
Bullshit!

10:49.775 --> 10:52.069
Roy, did you wanna get in
on this Diamond Dog situation?

10:52.069 --> 10:54.738
- Hey, Roy! Hey, Roy.
- Hey, Roy. Here, Roy.

10:54.738 --> 10:56.907
Here, Roy. Come here, Roy.

10:56.907 --> 10:58.951
La, la, la, la, la!

10:58.951 --> 11:02.996
So, the match of the week
is clearly Richmond and West Ham.

10:59.034 --> 11:02.996
So, the match of the week
is clearly Richmond and West Ham.

11:02.996 --> 11:05.791
<i>Now, it's been a strong start
to the season for both of these teams,</i>

11:05.791 --> 11:09.002
<i>but I think the Hammers are favorites,
going into the London derby,</i>

11:09.002 --> 11:13.090
<i>based on the tactical acumen
of the Wonder Kid, Nathan Shelley.</i>

11:14.633 --> 11:17.261
<i>Yeah, Shelley is brilliant,
there's no doubt about that,</i>

11:17.261 --> 11:20.889
<i>but Zava, he is a genius.
I like the Greyhounds for this one.</i>

11:20.889 --> 11:22.266
That's my guy!

11:22.266 --> 11:24.226
No, you can't have him. He's mine.

11:26.645 --> 11:29.064
- Let's move on, shall we, to Sunday's--
- Hey, look. Guys, guys.

11:29.064 --> 11:30.232
Who cares, right?

11:31.525 --> 11:33.318
Now come on, we've got work to do.
Let's go.

11:34.152 --> 11:35.320
He is correct.

11:37.990 --> 11:42.619
We must ignore these talking faces.
Even when they are in our favor.

11:43.161 --> 11:44.663
Thank you, "Zorro."

11:45.247 --> 11:48.250
Exactly,
but it's actually pronounced "Zoreaux."

11:51.795 --> 11:52.796
Why?

11:54.923 --> 11:57.467
I don't know. Because that's how
my parents say it, I guess?

11:59.136 --> 12:04.057
My friend, you can be
whoever you want to be.

12:05.475 --> 12:09.688
I let all of my children name themselves
once they reach the age of seven.

12:11.481 --> 12:13.984
That is why my eldest is called
"Smingus Dingus."

12:16.069 --> 12:19.323
Dream big, and you may never wake up.

12:23.410 --> 12:24.995
Thank you.

12:24.995 --> 12:26.413
Jesus.

12:26.413 --> 12:30.626
I can't believe I'm about to say this,
but hey, lads, I agree with Zava.

12:30.626 --> 12:33.754
Yes, it's a big fucking game,
but we've just gotta focus, do what we do,

12:33.754 --> 12:35.464
- do you know what I mean?
- Yeah. He's right.

12:35.464 --> 12:36.673
And don't forget, yeah?

12:40.761 --> 12:43.972
- Believe in "Believe."
- Yes.

12:45.015 --> 12:45.933
What the--

12:46.517 --> 12:47.768
What?

12:48.477 --> 12:49.895
- Oh, shit.
- What?

12:55.317 --> 12:57.611
- Why the fuck did you do that?
- I was just checking

12:57.611 --> 12:59.571
if I acquired the ability
to chop things in half.

13:00.072 --> 13:01.073
Yeah, and what if you had?

13:02.950 --> 13:04.743
Sorry, bruv. I didn't think it through.

13:06.787 --> 13:09.873
Fellas. Someone ripped this in half.

13:09.873 --> 13:11.416
What the fuck? What?

13:12.292 --> 13:13.293
What the fuck?

13:14.086 --> 13:15.254
You're joking

13:18.382 --> 13:19.383
What the fuck?

13:42.948 --> 13:43.949
Hello...

13:44.741 --> 13:45.993
Jade.

13:48.537 --> 13:49.538
Nathan.

13:51.540 --> 13:52.541
Shelley.

13:54.543 --> 13:56.003
Lovely to see you again.

13:56.003 --> 13:57.296
Okay.

13:58.881 --> 14:00.299
Sorry I've not been around much.

14:01.550 --> 14:02.676
You haven't?

14:02.676 --> 14:06.722
No. No, I've been really busy
with my new job.

14:06.722 --> 14:11.476
Big new job just keeping me very busy.

14:12.060 --> 14:15.105
Sounds silly. Maybe you should quit
your big new busy job.

14:17.482 --> 14:19.693
Anyway, just here to pick up my takeaway.

14:19.693 --> 14:21.945
I bought lunch for my whole staff.

14:21.945 --> 14:24.072
Apart from the trainers,
'cause they eat like cows.

14:25.449 --> 14:28.160
Sorry, that sounds-- No, they're love--
I mean, they're lovely people.

14:28.160 --> 14:29.494
They're just vegetarians.

14:34.208 --> 14:35.751
No way.

14:36.502 --> 14:40.964
Look who's here. No fucking way!

14:41.548 --> 14:43.842
- Do you know who this is?
- Jason Jelly.

14:43.842 --> 14:45.886
- That's right.
- No, "Nathan Shelley."

14:45.886 --> 14:47.888
That's right, Nathan Shelley,

14:47.888 --> 14:50.891
manager of West Ham United,
in my restaurant!

14:52.309 --> 14:53.769
- Big week, my guy.
- Yep.

14:53.769 --> 14:57.814
Big fucking week.
I'm Derek. I'm the manager here.

14:58.440 --> 15:00.359
Anything you need, you got it.

15:01.026 --> 15:03.570
- Okay.
- From one manager to another.

15:04.071 --> 15:05.864
Yeah, well, it's not quite the same, but--

15:06.907 --> 15:08.492
Facing your team this week.

15:09.034 --> 15:10.410
That's gotta be hard-core, right?

15:11.370 --> 15:13.830
I mean, you talked a lot of shit
about them in the press.

15:13.830 --> 15:17.793
- Didn't ya? I loved it.
- Sorry, can I pay?

15:18.377 --> 15:24.591
No.
This is on me, okay? On me. Understand?

15:24.591 --> 15:27.094
This man's money is no good here.

15:27.719 --> 15:31.181
Never charge. Except for booze.
Gotta charge for booze.

15:31.181 --> 15:32.891
I didn't order any booze. It's 12:30.

15:35.269 --> 15:37.563
Knock 'em dead. Go Hammers!

15:40.858 --> 15:43.944
No way. Oi, do you know who this is?

15:49.616 --> 15:50.784
All right, okay. Bye.

16:05.549 --> 16:06.592
And cut!

16:06.592 --> 16:08.552
Lovely, Colin. Thank you.

16:08.552 --> 16:11.346
All right. Okay, Dani, you're up.

16:12.973 --> 16:13.849
I'm very nervous.

16:13.849 --> 16:16.852
No. Don't be nervous. Look, just sit here.
Look into the camera

16:16.852 --> 16:18.854
and pretend you're talking
to an old friend.

16:18.854 --> 16:20.189
My oldest friend is Javiar.

16:20.189 --> 16:22.691
Great. How long have you known Javiar?

16:22.691 --> 16:26.278
Only a couple of months,
but he turns 108 years old next week.

16:27.738 --> 16:29.615
- Perfect.
- Yeah.

16:30.699 --> 16:31.825
Final checks.

16:33.702 --> 16:34.703
Thank you.

16:36.914 --> 16:38.123
- Hello, Keeley.
- Hi.

16:38.123 --> 16:41.919
Yeah.
Just scoot to your left a little bit.

16:41.919 --> 16:45.172
Yeah, that's it. Okay, off you go, Dani.

16:45.756 --> 16:49.760
You may not know who I am, but I think
the most beautiful parts of a woman

16:50.511 --> 16:51.803
are her flaws.

16:52.471 --> 16:55.807
And cut! Thank you, Dani. Next!

16:55.807 --> 16:56.892
Okay.

17:00.854 --> 17:02.689
- Brought you coffee.
- Yeah.

17:02.689 --> 17:04.900
- How's it going?
- Oh, my God. This is great.

17:04.900 --> 17:06.234
- Yeah?
- They're great.

17:06.234 --> 17:08.529
I just-- I love being the boss.

17:08.529 --> 17:10.614
- Cheers to that. Yeah.
- Cheers to that.

17:10.614 --> 17:11.990
You ready, Zoreaux?

17:12.532 --> 17:14.660
Yeah,
but I actually go by "Van Damme" now.

17:15.285 --> 17:17.704
Okay, great. Action, Van Damme.

17:19.205 --> 17:20.665
You don't know who I am,

17:20.665 --> 17:23.377
but I'm looking for someone
who likes short walks on the beach,

17:23.377 --> 17:26.964
so we can spend more time, you know...

17:32.177 --> 17:33.720
And cut.

17:33.720 --> 17:36.515
Great, thanks, Van Damme. Next!

17:38.058 --> 17:40.018
- Van Damme?
- Yeah. It's my new name.

17:40.602 --> 17:42.229
Cool. Why?

17:42.813 --> 17:44.106
Because I love Jean-Claude Van Damme,

17:44.106 --> 17:46.149
and Zava told me
I should be whoever I wanna be.

17:47.401 --> 17:49.611
- Okay, yeah. Cool.
- All right, Van Damme.

17:49.611 --> 17:51.321
- All right, boys.
- Take it easy.

17:52.656 --> 17:54.074
He's so fucking hot.

17:55.200 --> 17:58.954
- What's his story?
- Jamie? He's so cocky.

18:00.414 --> 18:02.374
But I guess you have to be at this level.

18:03.333 --> 18:04.751
But he only thinks about himself.

18:07.129 --> 18:08.505
At least, he used to.

18:08.505 --> 18:11.049
Joking. No.

18:11.049 --> 18:14.469
But he's not accountable for his actions
and what they do to others.

18:15.637 --> 18:19.391
Except he is getting better
at making apologies.

18:21.435 --> 18:23.687
Still, he only thinks with his dick.

18:25.189 --> 18:29.109
And yet, I don't think
he's seen anyone in ages.

18:31.528 --> 18:33.780
I just wanna know if I can bang him, babe.

18:37.826 --> 18:39.036
I don't know.

18:39.620 --> 18:41.580
You should probably ask him,
it's his dick.

18:41.580 --> 18:43.916
Cool. Off you go, Jamie.

18:52.508 --> 18:53.842
What are y'all still doing here?

18:53.842 --> 18:55.844
Coach, you're gonna wanna watch this.

18:55.844 --> 18:57.137
Is it one of them videos

18:57.137 --> 18:59.306
of a military parent
coming home after a long tour?

18:59.306 --> 19:01.600
'Cause if so, I'm gonna be eating tears
and snot for dinner.

18:59.389 --> 19:01.600
'Cause if so, I'm gonna be eating tears
and snot for dinner.

19:01.600 --> 19:02.684
Not quite.

19:45.894 --> 19:46.895
Here we go.

19:55.153 --> 19:56.738
Where'd this come from?

19:56.738 --> 19:59.366
This fucking legend
thought to pull the security footage

19:59.366 --> 20:00.868
when we told him about the sign.

19:59.449 --> 20:00.868
when we told him about the sign.

20:00.868 --> 20:02.661
I guess you can take the boy
out of journalism

20:02.661 --> 20:04.329
but you can't take journalism
out of the boy.

20:04.329 --> 20:06.373
Right, you fucking ruined it now.
The point is,

20:06.373 --> 20:08.876
the answer we were looking for
has arrived.

20:09.459 --> 20:10.627
What are you talking about?

20:10.627 --> 20:14.047
A video like this could motivate a team, perhaps.

20:17.718 --> 20:19.011
Thank you for your help, Trent.

20:19.511 --> 20:21.805
May a young Robert Redford
portray you in a film someday.

20:22.389 --> 20:23.599
Probably Dustin Hoffman.

20:23.599 --> 20:24.850
- Good night.
- Good night.

20:26.393 --> 20:28.270
Go home, guys. Get some sleep.

20:29.605 --> 20:30.814
Okay.

20:30.814 --> 20:32.566
- Good night, Ted. Night, Beard.
- Good night.

20:32.566 --> 20:33.650
Night, Coach.

20:40.949 --> 20:42.117
Coach.

20:42.951 --> 20:46.038
I was thinking about your Sassy situation.

20:46.622 --> 20:47.581
Yeah.

20:47.581 --> 20:49.124
Jane's sister is in town.

20:49.124 --> 20:51.210
- No, thank you, Coach.
- That's the right answer.

21:10.896 --> 21:13.106
Burning the midnight oil, I see.

21:14.858 --> 21:16.944
Yeah. Sorry for the smell.

21:18.779 --> 21:20.489
The oil burning.

21:22.616 --> 21:25.452
So, you're feeling confident
about this weekend?

21:26.119 --> 21:27.788
Yeah, no, I think so.

21:30.832 --> 21:33.210
Yeah, no. Go-- Yeah.
We're gonna destroy, right?

21:34.002 --> 21:35.212
Good.

21:35.212 --> 21:37.422
No, it's just, I--

21:39.675 --> 21:41.885
I just haven't seen Ted since I left and...

21:43.887 --> 21:46.014
We didn't leave on the best of terms and...

21:47.766 --> 21:50.018
I feel like I owe him
an apology or something.

21:50.018 --> 21:52.312
You did what was best for you.

21:52.896 --> 21:54.314
What were you meant to do?

21:54.314 --> 21:57.025
Hang around,
supporting Ted for the rest of your life?

21:57.025 --> 21:58.610
I don't think so.

22:05.117 --> 22:07.911
You've done nothing wrong, Nathan,
I promise you.

22:09.872 --> 22:11.540
You earned this job.

22:14.585 --> 22:16.545
Well, so what do I say when I see him?

22:17.462 --> 22:19.756
You say nothing, apart from "hello."

22:21.091 --> 22:23.510
You look him in the eye.
You shake his hand.

22:25.053 --> 22:26.763
And then you beat him.

22:29.183 --> 22:30.851
And then we go and celebrate.

22:32.186 --> 22:33.187
Okay.

22:33.854 --> 22:34.730
Good night, Nathan.

22:37.900 --> 22:40.986
Good night, Rupert. Thank you.

22:42.446 --> 22:43.572
Mr. Mannion.

23:33.705 --> 23:34.706
Hey.

23:35.374 --> 23:37.042
Working late? Or hardly working?

23:37.042 --> 23:39.294
Well, I don't think
that's how the joke goes.

23:39.294 --> 23:40.504
What joke?

23:41.588 --> 23:42.798
Never mind. What's up?

23:46.051 --> 23:47.636
I really want to win this one.

23:48.929 --> 23:50.013
I know.

23:57.354 --> 23:58.522
Everything okay?

24:04.987 --> 24:06.238
Am I a mess?

24:06.238 --> 24:07.823
Of course you are.
That's why we get along.

24:11.326 --> 24:16.373
And I wish I could tell you
to ignore Sass, but she's usually right.

24:18.041 --> 24:20.919
So, Sassy already told you
about the-- Of course. Girl talk.

24:21.587 --> 24:22.588
Girl talk.

24:25.757 --> 24:28.218
So, is everything all right?

24:30.012 --> 24:31.013
Yeah, I'm good.

24:31.013 --> 24:32.139
Oklahoma?

24:40.314 --> 24:41.982
I'm a work in "progmess."

24:48.071 --> 24:49.072
Good night, Ted.

24:53.118 --> 24:54.328
You already won, you know?

24:56.914 --> 24:58.457
You got that turkey out of your life.

25:02.878 --> 25:03.879
Beat them.

25:07.216 --> 25:08.300
Good night, boss.

25:54.930 --> 25:56.890
Oi, do I look all right?

25:56.890 --> 25:58.600
Of course you do. Why?

25:58.600 --> 26:00.018
Well, if Jack actually shows up,

25:58.684 --> 26:00.018
Well, if Jack actually shows up,

26:00.018 --> 26:03.272
I want him to think that I look
mysterious and powerful.

26:03.272 --> 26:04.690
Dynamic, you know?

26:04.690 --> 26:09.570
- All of that.
- You are mysterious, powerful and dynamic.

26:12.990 --> 26:14.157
Shit, I'm nervous.

26:15.826 --> 26:17.828
I think I need to go
and reapply my lip liner.

26:19.955 --> 26:21.790
- I'll see you upstairs in the suite.
- Yep.

26:25.377 --> 26:27.045
Hey, Rebecca!

26:27.045 --> 26:29.590
- Rupert.
- Wonderful to see you.

26:30.382 --> 26:33.218
- Bex. Love the new hair.
- Hi.

26:33.802 --> 26:35.012
I haven't changed my hair.

26:35.012 --> 26:37.139
Nor should you. It's perfection.

26:38.640 --> 26:40.142
So, how's the little one?

26:40.142 --> 26:44.271
Oh, yeah, Diane. She's already walking.
Can you believe that?

26:44.271 --> 26:47.191
Yeah.
Drooling and pooing around the house.

26:47.691 --> 26:48.901
Takes after her father.

26:51.195 --> 26:54.114
Well. Hey, take it easy on us today.

26:54.990 --> 26:56.366
No promises.

27:08.879 --> 27:10.005
Oh, shit.

27:21.391 --> 27:22.476
Excuse me.

27:22.476 --> 27:24.978
I've got a bit of a situation here.

27:28.649 --> 27:31.818
Thank you. But it's actually not that.

27:35.155 --> 27:36.532
You're a lifesaver!

27:37.950 --> 27:39.284
Usually I'm like clockwork,

27:39.284 --> 27:42.037
but because I've been so stressed,
I've come on early.

27:43.455 --> 27:46.375
I'm so happy that it's a super
and not a skinny.

27:46.375 --> 27:48.126
Who are those even for?

27:48.126 --> 27:51.672
It's not like my vagina is on a diet,
I'm on my fucking period.

27:53.340 --> 27:54.883
Oi, thanks for helping me.

27:54.883 --> 27:56.385
And I love your shoes!

27:56.385 --> 28:00.681
- Yeah. Thanks. Pay it forward.
- Yeah.

27:56.468 --> 28:00.681
- Yeah. Thanks. Pay it forward.
- Yeah.

28:07.771 --> 28:09.398
Sorry. Excuse me.

28:11.775 --> 28:12.776
Hi.

28:14.778 --> 28:15.779
Boy, you're tall.

28:16.613 --> 28:18.282
Is your dad a tree or something?

28:19.116 --> 28:20.284
No, I'm screwing around.

28:21.618 --> 28:23.787
Hey, speaking of trees,
who are y'all rooting for today?

28:23.787 --> 28:24.913
West Ham.

28:25.414 --> 28:27.249
Yeah, no, that makes sense. Yeah.

28:33.338 --> 28:36.300
Go ahead. Yeah. Going down one more floor.

28:36.300 --> 28:38.552
- Thank you.
- Yeah, of course.

28:39.928 --> 28:41.096
Best of luck out there.

28:57.571 --> 28:59.156
Hey, Nate. That you?

29:01.366 --> 29:02.784
Hi. I didn't see you there.

29:02.784 --> 29:05.954
- That's okay. How you been, man?
- Yeah, okay.

29:06.455 --> 29:08.457
Yeah. Good.

29:14.296 --> 29:15.297
Listen, Ted.

29:16.298 --> 29:19.676
I just wanna say that the way I left--

29:19.676 --> 29:22.971
Nathan. There you are.

29:24.264 --> 29:25.265
Yeah.

29:31.939 --> 29:33.398
Hey, Rupert.

29:34.107 --> 29:36.485
- Ted.
- Nice to see you again.

29:38.403 --> 29:39.446
Good luck.

29:44.117 --> 29:46.828
- Keeley? Yeah.
- She's absolutely fantastic.

29:47.412 --> 29:48.372
Here she is now.

29:49.081 --> 29:52.584
- Hey. Yeah.
- Keeley? This is Jack Danvers.

29:52.584 --> 29:53.794
Hello.

29:55.003 --> 29:57.130
I believe you have something of mine.

29:59.383 --> 30:01.677
Oh, fuck. You're Jack?

30:03.554 --> 30:05.055
This is a bit embarrassing.

30:05.055 --> 30:07.891
- No.
- Yeah. We all thought you were a man.

30:07.891 --> 30:09.768
Yeah, that too.

30:10.394 --> 30:11.478
It's like that old riddle.

30:11.478 --> 30:13.939
- What riddle?
- You know, always a tricky one, this one.

30:13.939 --> 30:15.566
A father and son are in a car wreck.

30:15.566 --> 30:19.403
Dad dies instantly, the son is rushed
to an emergency room.

30:19.403 --> 30:21.446
A surgeon walks in and says,

30:21.446 --> 30:24.241
"I can't operate on this boy.
He's my son."

30:24.241 --> 30:25.784
How is it possible?

30:26.702 --> 30:28.120
- Because she's a woman.
- She's gay.

30:28.120 --> 30:30.163
- Sperm donor.
- He lives in a simulation?

30:30.831 --> 30:33.709
Right.
Yeah, I guess that's a bit dated now.

30:35.002 --> 30:37.588
So, I assume "Jack" is short
for "Jacqueline," right?

30:37.588 --> 30:39.506
No. It's short for my father wanted a boy.

30:41.633 --> 30:45.721
I'm gonna go and sit down now, outside. Now.

30:46.680 --> 30:48.015
Jack, welcome.

30:48.015 --> 30:50.601
We are not allowed to take drinks
to our seats.

30:50.601 --> 30:53.061
So if you want to get plastered,
we should probably do that now.

30:53.562 --> 30:54.563
Okay.

30:55.856 --> 30:57.566
Well, after you.

31:00.777 --> 31:02.654
You're so funny, Rebecca.

31:05.157 --> 31:07.242
Barbara's obsessed with Rebecca.

31:08.160 --> 31:11.330
I hope she doesn't try and kill her
and wear her skin as a suit.

31:15.918 --> 31:17.252
What the fuck?

31:17.252 --> 31:19.171
Cheers. It's gonna be a good day.

31:19.796 --> 31:21.757
- All right, Baz.
- Oi!

31:22.925 --> 31:25.093
This is a Richmond pub.

31:26.178 --> 31:27.804
It's all right, Mae. He's with me.

31:32.643 --> 31:34.228
Get the fuck out!

31:39.525 --> 31:40.859
Come on, Richmond!

31:40.859 --> 31:43.612
Come on, Richmond! Come on, Richmond!

31:43.612 --> 31:45.447
<i>It's a full house for today's battle</i>

31:45.447 --> 31:49.451
<i>between West Ham United
and Zava's AFC Richmond.</i>

31:49.451 --> 31:53.121
<i>A win would take either team
to the top spot in the table,</i>

31:53.121 --> 31:56.250
<i>knocking mighty Manchester City
off number one.</i>

31:56.792 --> 31:58.961
Should be a tight match, Chris.
Any predictions?

31:58.961 --> 32:00.838
I stopped making predictions, Arlo.

31:59.044 --> 32:00.838
I stopped making predictions, Arlo.

32:00.838 --> 32:02.256
Because I was never wrong.

32:02.256 --> 32:05.592
Got to the point I was worried
I was the one making things happen.

32:05.592 --> 32:07.010
Well, that's interesting.

32:07.010 --> 32:08.178
I knew you'd say that.

32:08.178 --> 32:10.681
<i>They fade and die</i>

32:10.681 --> 32:14.768
<i>Fortune's always hiding</i>

32:14.768 --> 32:18.522
<i>I've looked everywhere</i>

32:18.522 --> 32:22.442
<i>I'm forever blowing bubbles</i>

32:22.442 --> 32:26.405
<i>Pretty bubbles in the air</i>

32:26.405 --> 32:29.116
United! United!

32:29.116 --> 32:32.160
United! United!

32:32.160 --> 32:34.997
United! United!

32:36.373 --> 32:37.374
Nate.

32:39.293 --> 32:41.128
Let's have fun out there today, yeah?

33:06.695 --> 33:09.156
<i>West Ham are quite happy
to just soak up the pressure.</i>

33:09.156 --> 33:12.659
<i>Not taking any risks at all
against Richmond,</i>

33:12.659 --> 33:14.661
<i>of all teams, at home.</i>

33:15.412 --> 33:18.874
- A sign of how far Richmond have come.
- It's all right. We're okay.

33:18.874 --> 33:20.459
<i>What a threat Zava is.</i>

33:20.459 --> 33:23.837
Richmond! To the right!
Tight! Don't get scared.

33:28.175 --> 33:32.012
<i>And it stays nil-nil,
thanks to an amazing save by Zoreaux.</i>

33:32.012 --> 33:34.223
- Van Damme.
- Van Damme!

33:34.223 --> 33:36.183
I hear he wants
to be called "Van Damme" now.

33:36.183 --> 33:37.100
Why?

33:37.100 --> 33:39.686
Well, we'd probably have to dive
into his childhood for that answer.

33:40.938 --> 33:44.650
<i>Richmond need the key pass
to unlock the Hammers' defense.</i>

33:44.650 --> 33:45.734
<i>That could be the one.</i>

33:47.402 --> 33:48.946
- Tartt hits the woodwork.
- No!

33:48.946 --> 33:51.031
- That was close.
- Zava was wide open.

33:54.284 --> 33:55.953
For Zava!

33:56.828 --> 34:00.791
<i>There'll be two more minutes
in the first half of this scoreless,</i>

34:00.791 --> 34:02.918
<i>but pulsating, London derby.</i>

34:04.586 --> 34:07.464
- Obisanya caught in possession.
- No.

34:07.464 --> 34:09.675
<i>And here come West Ham on the break.</i>

34:10.467 --> 34:12.386
<i>Armando bearing down on goal.</i>

34:14.471 --> 34:15.639
- Yeah!
- Yes!

34:15.639 --> 34:18.266
<i>And it's there. Right under Van Damme.</i>

34:18.266 --> 34:21.228
<i>The Canadian keeper apparently
not as unstoppable</i>

34:21.228 --> 34:23.105
<i>as the Muscles from Brussels.</i>

34:23.105 --> 34:25.983
<i>That's not fair, Arlo. Nobody is.</i>

34:25.983 --> 34:27.943
- We've been here before. Come on.
- Come on, lads.

34:27.943 --> 34:31.487
<i>The Hammers go up 1-nil
just before halftime.</i>

34:32.072 --> 34:34.032
Fuck it.

34:34.032 --> 34:37.077
All right, guys. Come on, now.
Let's end this half strong!

34:38.328 --> 34:39.204
Huddle.

34:42.623 --> 34:43.958
What's this shit?

34:45.043 --> 34:46.128
I don't know.

34:46.128 --> 34:48.880
- Lower. Move it right. Five.
- Brilliant.

34:48.880 --> 34:51.257
- Right now, come on. Five.
- Ref, just blow the fucking whistle.

34:55.429 --> 34:56.554
<i>West Ham pressing now.</i>

34:56.554 --> 34:58.515
- No.
- A new tactic from the Hammers

34:58.515 --> 35:00.642
<i>in the closing seconds of the first half.</i>

34:58.599 --> 35:00.642
<i>in the closing seconds of the first half.</i>

35:00.642 --> 35:02.561
<i>It's never too late to change, Arlo.</i>

35:04.938 --> 35:07.816
- No!
- Fuck! Fuck you! Fuck!

35:07.816 --> 35:11.028
<i>And it's 2-nil. Oh, deary me.</i>

35:15.616 --> 35:16.617
Excuse me.

35:20.829 --> 35:22.206
How did that happen?

35:24.124 --> 35:25.542
<i>We go to halftime.</i>

35:25.542 --> 35:27.586
<i>Richmond have dominated possession,</i>

35:27.586 --> 35:31.757
<i>but out of absolutely nowhere,
it's 2-nil to the Hammers.</i>

35:31.757 --> 35:33.634
We don't deserve that.

35:33.634 --> 35:35.135
What the fuck just happened?

35:35.636 --> 35:36.803
I don't know.

35:39.681 --> 35:41.475
Hey, fellas. I'll be right back. Okay?

35:41.475 --> 35:42.768
The fuck are you going?

35:42.768 --> 35:45.729
- I'll just be a minute or two, okay?
- What do we tell the team?

35:45.729 --> 35:47.064
I don't know. Surprise me.

35:53.195 --> 35:55.489
Hey, boss. What you doing down here?

35:55.489 --> 35:58.659
I just wanted to tell you
that I believe in you, Ted.

35:58.659 --> 35:59.826
Uh-huh?

35:59.826 --> 36:02.955
And I know that I've been
putting an awful lot of pressure on you

35:59.910 --> 36:02.955
And I know that I've been
putting an awful lot of pressure on you

36:02.955 --> 36:07.793
to win today, but I just want you
to forget all about that.

36:07.793 --> 36:11.588
Just be yourself and have fun.

36:13.048 --> 36:14.049
- Okay.
- Yeah.

36:14.049 --> 36:16.009
Okay. Well, thank you.

36:17.803 --> 36:19.555
I believe in you, Ted.

36:20.889 --> 36:21.890
And it's intense.

36:24.268 --> 36:26.395
- I better go. All right.
- Off you pop.

36:28.897 --> 36:32.317
Remember, have fun!

36:34.403 --> 36:37.906
Yes! This is so exciting!

36:43.370 --> 36:44.413
No.

36:52.838 --> 36:54.173
This is your surprise, huh?

36:54.715 --> 36:57.885
A minute ago, they were catatonic.
Now look at them.

36:59.761 --> 37:02.472
- They're killers.
- Frankly, Ted, sometimes that's good.

37:18.989 --> 37:21.200
<i>Oh, my. Richmond coming out of the tunnel</i>

37:21.200 --> 37:23.452
<i>with a palpable chip on their shoulder.</i>

37:24.036 --> 37:28.207
<i>Wow. A real tension on the pitch.
I think we're in for an exciting half.</i>

37:28.207 --> 37:31.335
<i>We begin the second half
with Richmond looking for a strong start.</i>

37:31.335 --> 37:33.587
- Come on, boys. Fucking kill 'em.
- Fucking kill 'em.

37:33.587 --> 37:34.963
- Here we go!
- Kill!

37:38.258 --> 37:40.052
<i>That's an awful tackle.</i>

37:40.052 --> 37:41.845
- He would be fortunate to escape...
- Oh, fuck.

37:41.845 --> 37:43.180
<i>...with just a yellow.</i>

37:43.180 --> 37:45.098
<i>It's a deserved red, and Richmond</i>

37:45.098 --> 37:48.393
<i>will play almost the entire second half
with ten men.</i>

37:49.686 --> 37:51.730
He's actually a very sweet young man.

37:53.273 --> 37:54.942
<i>Here come West Ham.</i>

37:58.445 --> 38:00.197
<i>And now Van Damme has been sent off.</i>

38:00.197 --> 38:02.783
- We're playing like Italians.
- I know.

38:03.534 --> 38:04.451
It's awesome.

38:07.329 --> 38:08.914
Oh, dear.

38:20.592 --> 38:22.845
<i>It's getting a touch spicy out there.</i>

38:22.845 --> 38:26.139
<i>Spicy, Arlo? This is vintage vindaloo.</i>

38:28.559 --> 38:29.434
No.

38:41.780 --> 38:45.784
<i>Montlaur has lost his mind,
and Richmond have lost a third player.</i>

38:55.294 --> 38:57.004
Fucking come on.

38:57.588 --> 39:00.591
<i>Richmond have completely lost the plot.</i>

39:01.508 --> 39:05.137
<i>Zava must be wondering
what he's done to deserve this.</i>

39:10.601 --> 39:11.602
Yes!

39:12.144 --> 39:14.104
<i>And it's 4-1 to the Hammers.</i>

39:14.104 --> 39:17.024
<i>It went from evenly matched
to unevenly matched</i>

39:17.024 --> 39:21.069
<i>to light a match on fire
and put it into a can of petrol.</i>

39:21.069 --> 39:23.488
<i>That second half should've come
with a trigger warning.</i>

39:23.488 --> 39:27.826
<i>One extraordinary goal by Zava
did not make it any less tough to watch.</i>

39:27.826 --> 39:31.496
<i>Richmond showed a side of themselves
we've never seen before.</i>

39:31.496 --> 39:34.082
<i>They played angry, dirty and ugly.</i>

39:34.082 --> 39:37.127
<i>Which are also the names
of Zava's three youngest kids.</i>

39:37.753 --> 39:39.213
Shit.

39:41.798 --> 39:42.799
Shit.

39:44.092 --> 39:45.135
Shit.

39:45.135 --> 39:47.262
- Hey, it's okay.
- Shit.

39:52.059 --> 39:53.310
Did you guys have fun?

39:53.310 --> 39:54.394
Yeah.

39:54.394 --> 39:57.439
The violence was quite entertaining,
wasn't it? In a way.

40:05.197 --> 40:07.324
Sending off Van Damme was a mistake.

40:08.033 --> 40:09.326
He played with passion.

40:10.536 --> 40:13.080
"Passion" is a word we use
when we talk about love.

40:14.706 --> 40:17.960
It is also a word we use
to describe a crime.

40:19.670 --> 40:21.213
Sometimes it is also a fruit.

40:25.759 --> 40:27.094
Oh, gosh. I'm so sorry.

40:48.782 --> 40:51.368
- We fucked up.
- We overcorrected and played with hate.

40:54.162 --> 40:56.957
- Be great if you yelled at us a bit.
- Please.

40:58.750 --> 41:01.170
- Call us pieces of shit or something.
- Now.

41:02.671 --> 41:03.881
You can hit us.

41:03.881 --> 41:05.132
Get it over with.

41:06.967 --> 41:09.011
Tried something new. It didn't work.
Big whoop.

41:11.388 --> 41:13.432
I will take that thumb drive
one of y'all's got.

41:22.441 --> 41:25.319
Shake it off, fellas.
Lot of football left this season.

41:29.323 --> 41:31.491
- What a fucking arsehole.
- I know.

41:31.491 --> 41:34.453
You have to feel pretty good
about yourself after that win, yeah?

41:34.453 --> 41:36.788
Well, yeah. Richmond were clearly rattled.

41:37.873 --> 41:39.833
It was easier than I expected,
if I'm honest.

41:40.375 --> 41:41.376
What about Ted?

41:41.376 --> 41:44.254
Quite a snub not to shake his hand
at the end of the game.

41:45.464 --> 41:48.842
Did I not? I didn't mean to.

41:48.842 --> 41:53.096
I-- Guess I just got caught up
in the excitement of it all. Yeah.

41:55.140 --> 41:56.183
Excuse me a minute. I just...

42:08.570 --> 42:11.323
Coach Shelley,
Mr. Mannion asked me to give you this.

42:13.158 --> 42:14.701
He'll meet you there in an hour.

42:17.829 --> 42:18.664
Thank--

42:36.390 --> 42:39.017
- It's so good to see you, Rebecca.
- You too, Bex.

42:39.017 --> 42:40.978
Oh, Rebecca, my dear.

42:40.978 --> 42:44.731
- So sorry for your loss.
- Thank you.

42:44.731 --> 42:47.150
Come on, old man.
It's way past your bedtime.

42:51.363 --> 42:52.364
Lovely to see you.

42:53.699 --> 42:55.284
I saw you with your assistant.

42:56.660 --> 42:58.912
Your daughter deserves better,
and so does Bex.

42:59.997 --> 43:01.248
Stop fucking around.

43:10.007 --> 43:11.008
Here you go.

43:12.259 --> 43:15.012
We are normally a lot better than that.
And nicer.

43:15.012 --> 43:19.808
Well, it's never great when your team
gets more red cards than goals, is it?

43:19.808 --> 43:20.726
No.

43:22.227 --> 43:23.854
What a shit show.

43:25.856 --> 43:28.025
Anyway, good news. Bantr's trending.

43:28.025 --> 43:29.151
- It is?
- Yeah.

43:29.151 --> 43:32.154
Pretty sure
the change to the bio line helped.

43:32.696 --> 43:33.947
What are you talking about?

43:38.368 --> 43:39.620
Who did this?

43:39.620 --> 43:42.956
I did. This afternoon,
when I uploaded the vids.

43:43.457 --> 43:44.833
You're welcome.

43:46.335 --> 43:47.628
- Shandy.
- Yeah.

43:49.213 --> 43:53.634
This is the opposite
of what Bantr is trying to do.

43:53.634 --> 43:55.969
Are you joking? They're gonna love it.

43:55.969 --> 43:58.555
I've literally tripled their subscribers
in an hour.

43:59.848 --> 44:03.227
You need to change this back, now. Please.

44:04.394 --> 44:05.395
Yeah.

44:07.481 --> 44:09.441
It was really lovely to meet you.

44:10.192 --> 44:12.486
- You too.
- Excuse me.

44:18.283 --> 44:20.869
Hey. Here he is!

44:21.995 --> 44:24.456
The Wonder Kid himself.

44:27.000 --> 44:28.919
The man of the hour!

44:29.670 --> 44:31.380
Thank you very much, Mr. Mannion.

44:31.964 --> 44:34.341
Please, no. "Rupert."

44:35.259 --> 44:36.510
Nathan.

44:37.511 --> 44:39.221
Thanks, Ms. Kakes. That's...

44:39.221 --> 44:43.642
And Nathan,
allow me to introduce Anastasia.

44:45.185 --> 44:46.186
Huge fan.

44:49.439 --> 44:50.816
Oh, my God. You're famous.

44:50.816 --> 44:52.234
So are you.

44:57.990 --> 44:59.741
Congratulations to your victory.

45:00.701 --> 45:01.994
Yeah. Thank you.

45:10.544 --> 45:12.504
Come on, Tartt! One more before dinner!

45:15.382 --> 45:16.550
Let's go, Coach.

45:22.973 --> 45:24.516
<i>That was hard to watch.</i>

45:24.516 --> 45:28.437
<i>Thierry, West Ham's domination today
saw Ted Lasso being totally exposed</i>

45:28.437 --> 45:30.522
<i>by his former assistant Nate Shelley.</i>

45:30.522 --> 45:33.942
<i>Gary, I love this quote
from a Chinese philosopher, Laozi,</i>

45:33.942 --> 45:36.612
<i>"When the student is ready,
the teacher will appear.</i>

45:36.612 --> 45:40.157
<i>When the student is truly ready,
the teacher will disappear."</i>

45:40.157 --> 45:41.241
<i>The Greyhounds...</i>

46:10.938 --> 46:12.022
- Hi, Ted.
- Hey.

46:12.606 --> 46:13.649
<i>Sorry about the match.</i>

46:13.649 --> 46:16.151
No. That's all right. It was a tough one.

46:16.151 --> 46:18.320
<i>Henry's not here right now.
He's at a birthday party,</i>

46:18.320 --> 46:19.404
- but I'll--
- No, that's okay.

46:19.404 --> 46:22.991
I was actually hoping just
to chat with you. You got a minute?

46:23.659 --> 46:25.744
<i>Sure. Is everything okay?</i>

46:25.744 --> 46:31.583
Yeah. Well-- No. You know, I just...

46:33.001 --> 46:35.045
I wanted to say something real quick.

46:37.965 --> 46:38.966
Look, I...

46:39.716 --> 46:44.054
I know that you and I aren't, you know,
together anymore.

46:44.596 --> 46:47.140
And I respect that. Okay? I do.

46:52.938 --> 46:55.649
But, Well, you know,

46:55.649 --> 46:59.152
this whole thing with you and Dr. Jacob
really ticks me off.

47:01.029 --> 47:04.324
And I'm upset that we didn't ever really
get to talk about it

47:04.324 --> 47:06.159
before it all started.

47:07.911 --> 47:08.912
Yeah.

47:08.912 --> 47:13.625
And look,
I understand that me saying all this,

47:14.293 --> 47:17.129
might be the wrong thing to do, but...

47:19.339 --> 47:22.926
I just feel like not saying it...

47:26.346 --> 47:27.472
isn't the...

47:29.975 --> 47:31.602
Well, wouldn't be the right thing either.

47:35.480 --> 47:37.774
'Cause we gotta raise
this little boy together, you know?

47:40.110 --> 47:42.571
We're stuck with each other.
We're gonna share grandkids.

47:49.203 --> 47:50.787
I love you, Michelle.

47:53.624 --> 47:54.958
And I love Henry.

47:59.838 --> 48:01.548
And I love our family.

48:03.759 --> 48:05.177
No matter what it looks like.

48:12.184 --> 48:13.185
Okay?

48:16.230 --> 48:17.231
<i>Of course.</i>

48:21.818 --> 48:24.196
Well, I'll talk to y'all soon.

48:25.155 --> 48:27.741
Have a good night. Tell Henry I love him.

48:28.575 --> 48:29.618
<i>Good night, Ted.</i>
