07:14.304 --> 07:16.771
So? Command!

Well?

07:22.772 --> 07:24.306
Well, what?

07:24.406 --> 07:29.040
If you're second in command, what is your command?

Yeah, yeah. Just let me finish this hand.

08:09.447 --> 08:11.147

08:28.550 --> 08:30.917
Calm down, Cheetor.

08:31.017 --> 08:32.551
Better transform.

08:35.617 --> 08:37.084
That's better.

08:37.185 --> 08:38.718
Now tell us, slowly.

08:38.819 --> 08:42.453
Right. Terrorsaur's leading the Predacons now.

08:42.553 --> 08:43.953
He's going to attack our base.

08:44.052 --> 08:45.553
( both gasp )

08:45.653 --> 08:47.653
What about Megatron?

08:47.753 --> 08:50.954
Terrorsaur scrapped him like he was a maintenance bot.

08:51.054 --> 08:53.821
He must have found some monster energon source

08:53.921 --> 08:55.288
on that floating mountain.

08:55.388 --> 08:57.688
Floating mountain?

08:57.788 --> 09:01.055
I knew it. You got your circuits crossed, kiddo.

09:01.155 --> 09:05.323
Even on this weird dirtball, mountains don't fly.

09:05.423 --> 09:08.957
Not fly, float. It's true, Optimus.

09:09.057 --> 09:11.657
I saw it. Terrorsaur flew away from it

09:11.757 --> 09:13.957
faster than I've ever seen him move.

09:14.057 --> 09:16.591
Rhinox, intensify perimeter scan

09:16.691 --> 09:18.459
and see if you can get through to Dinobot.

09:18.559 --> 09:21.392
I want the Predacons spotted.

09:21.492 --> 09:25.259
Now, where did you see this floating mountain?

09:26.726 --> 09:28.593
CHEETOR: Right here.

09:28.693 --> 09:32.294
( mysterious theme playing )

09:32.394 --> 09:35.928
( panting ): Ah. The energon must be unstable.

09:36.028 --> 09:38.361
I-- I need more of it.

09:38.462 --> 09:43.029
Enough to finish off the Maximals for good.

09:52.464 --> 09:53.530
( chuckles )

09:53.630 --> 09:57.065
That's right. Lead me to your secret.

09:57.164 --> 10:00.232
Then we'll see who commands who.

10:00.332 --> 10:02.599
( laughs )

10:06.966 --> 10:08.533
I got two of them.

10:08.633 --> 10:11.401
Patch it into the map grid.

10:11.500 --> 10:14.468
Looks like Terrorsaur and-- Hm.

10:14.568 --> 10:16.568
Hey, what happened?

10:16.668 --> 10:18.302
Energon interference.

10:18.402 --> 10:21.669
They must be near a large concentration of it.

10:24.203 --> 10:26.970
Hm. A mountain of it to be more precise.

10:27.070 --> 10:29.137
Told you, rat breath.

10:29.237 --> 10:31.003
Heh. You ask me,

10:31.104 --> 10:33.971
you and Optimus both need to be de-bugged.

10:34.071 --> 10:36.138
You know, it's possible.

10:36.238 --> 10:38.305
If the energon were unstable,

10:38.405 --> 10:40.605
and there was a big enough concentration,

10:40.705 --> 10:43.206
it could lift a mountain off the ground.

10:43.306 --> 10:45.539
My thought exactly.

10:45.639 --> 10:47.440
Rattrap, rig for demolition

10:47.539 --> 10:49.940
and meet me at the roof hatch in five cycles.

10:50.040 --> 10:51.207
To do what?

10:51.307 --> 10:52.740
Destroy that mountain

10:52.841 --> 10:55.408
before the Predacons try to secure it.

10:55.508 --> 10:58.775
Rhinox, set the defense grid on maximum.

Man, oh, man. If I wanted to fly,

11:41.249 --> 11:43.749
I would've become a bat, not a rat.

11:43.849 --> 11:47.549
It was the fastest way. And will you stop wiggling?

11:50.083 --> 11:53.450
Ulp! I really, really hate this.

11:53.550 --> 11:55.951

Look, his circuits can't hold a charge that massive for long.

13:40.535 --> 13:42.568
I'll lead him away. You set the charges,

13:42.668 --> 13:44.202
and I'll come back for you in four cycles.

16:50.634 --> 16:54.167
DIAGNOSTIC: Energon drain. Stasis lock imminent.

16:54.268 --> 16:56.934
No, not now!

16:58.468 --> 16:59.968
( screeches )

17:06.969 --> 17:11.137
I'll be back for you as soon as I replenish my power.

17:13.570 --> 17:16.871
Unh. Got to get to Rattrap.

17:16.971 --> 17:18.571
Not much time.

17:36.774 --> 17:39.675
You can't win, vermin. I am your superior!

17:39.775 --> 17:43.175
Stick it in your command module, eight-eyes!

17:43.276 --> 17:44.808
( yelling )

17:46.576 --> 17:48.342

17:56.710 --> 17:59.344
( laughs )

17:59.444 --> 18:03.012
Heh. That'll teach you to mess with the rat.

18:03.112 --> 18:04.712
( screeches )

18:06.946 --> 18:10.313
Man. Looks like Optimus lost this round.

18:10.413 --> 18:13.647
And that means I'm one gone rat.

18:15.414 --> 18:17.748
( panting ): Must recharge...

18:17.848 --> 18:20.549
Must-- Ah!

( ominous theme playing )

18:22.215 --> 18:25.216
Ah! Demolition charges.

18:25.316 --> 18:29.283
They'll tear this mountain to pieces!

( explosion )

18:45.119 --> 18:48.519
Well, at least I'm going out with a bang.

18:48.619 --> 18:49.719
( explosion )

18:49.819 --> 18:52.487
The only place we're going is home.

18:52.587 --> 18:55.154
Fearless leader! Woo-hoo!

18:55.254 --> 18:56.954
I thought you was scrap.

18:57.054 --> 18:59.821
Well, we'll both be if we don't hurry.

18:59.922 --> 19:01.788
On my back, quick.

19:01.888 --> 19:04.522
Okay, make like a bird.

19:04.622 --> 19:08.089
Can't. The energon blasts would fry my circuits permanently.

19:08.190 --> 19:10.023
Just hold on tight.

19:10.123 --> 19:12.790
Oh, man, oh, man, oh, man.

19:12.890 --> 19:18.558
Don't tell me you're gonna jump!

19:21.325 --> 19:23.625
( Rattrap screaming )

19:36.128 --> 19:38.428
( both grunt )

19:39.562 --> 19:41.361
We're dead, right?

19:41.461 --> 19:44.162
( grunts )

19:44.262 --> 19:45.763
Not this time.

19:45.862 --> 19:49.063
But my arms feel like refried rubber bands.

19:49.163 --> 19:52.263
Would you mind taking a little weight off my back?

19:52.363 --> 19:53.864
( grunts )

19:53.964 --> 19:56.331
( sighs )

19:56.431 --> 19:59.331
( grunts then sighs )

19:59.431 --> 20:01.598
You do know that was crazy.

20:01.698 --> 20:04.299
Ah, sometimes crazy works.

20:04.399 --> 20:06.465
By the way, you did good up there.

20:06.566 --> 20:09.567
Heh. Ah, you weren't so bad yourself.

20:09.667 --> 20:14.301
But, uh, don't tell anybody I said so.

20:14.401 --> 20:16.634
( screeching )

20:16.734 --> 20:19.135
Blast those Maximals!

20:19.235 --> 20:21.868
They destroyed my power!

20:21.968 --> 20:24.969
But at least I got rid of Megatron.

20:28.536 --> 20:31.170
( ominous theme playing )

20:31.270 --> 20:33.470
Well, well.

20:33.571 --> 20:36.038
Look who's back.

20:36.138 --> 20:37.971
Help!
