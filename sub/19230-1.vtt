00:13.640 --> 00:17.270
What? You want to see him?

00:18.510 --> 00:19.240
Yeah.

00:19.920 --> 00:21.880
Why do you want to see him?

00:21.950 --> 00:24.610
There's nothing interesting about him.

00:24.790 --> 00:26.720
That's right. It's a waste of time.

00:26.890 --> 00:28.880
Just tell me!

00:29.460 --> 00:31.430
I heard that he's here.

00:32.229 --> 00:34.720
The Shinigami who went down
to the Human World

00:34.800 --> 00:36.460
and did some interesting things.

01:17.110 --> 01:18.170
Who is it?

01:18.440 --> 01:22.780
I've come to see you.
I want you to tell me your story.

01:23.550 --> 01:24.480
Story?

01:24.680 --> 01:26.380
I won't ask you to do it for free.

01:33.960 --> 01:37.950
I would have liked it
if it was a little juicier...

01:42.260 --> 01:44.390
I want to go to the lower world.

01:44.800 --> 01:47.270
I'm sick of this stagnant world.

01:47.600 --> 01:51.040
I heard that the Human World is fun.

01:55.780 --> 02:00.080
It's no fun watching guys
who complain about a dull world.

02:00.150 --> 02:03.050
It's fun watching a guy
who foolishly thinks that...

02:03.120 --> 02:05.680
he can change the world.

02:08.789 --> 02:13.460
Fine. I was getting bored, anyway.
I'll tell you my story.

02:14.960 --> 02:16.930
This is for that gross apple.

02:17.730 --> 02:21.190
This is a story of a human...

02:21.430 --> 02:24.960
who tried to change the world
and become God.

02:31.280 --> 02:36.650
Someone's got to do it...
Things are no good as they are!

02:38.220 --> 02:41.420
<i>Each day...repeats...itself.</i>

02:42.490 --> 02:47.360
<i>It would be better for the world</i>
<i>if everyone was dead!</i>

02:48.330 --> 02:50.600
<i>That's right. The world is corrupt.</i>

02:52.150 --> 02:54.150
<i>Those who are corrupt</i>
<i>are better off dead!</i>

02:55.540 --> 02:58.270
<i>I'm going to...change the world...</i>

02:59.440 --> 03:01.000
<i>with the Death Note!</i>

03:02.950 --> 03:05.470
<i>I'm going to wipe out evildoers.</i>

03:06.080 --> 03:08.570
<i>Yes, I'm cleansing the world!</i>

03:09.120 --> 03:11.520
<i>Those who have committed</i>
<i>terrible crimes...</i>

03:11.590 --> 03:13.220
<i>will succumb to heart attacks...</i>

03:14.320 --> 03:17.350
<i>Even an idiot will be able to figure out</i>
<i>that someone is behind it.</i>

03:18.060 --> 03:21.030
<i>I'm going to let everyone</i>
<i>know of my existence!</i>

03:22.100 --> 03:23.830
<i>The power to fight evil!</i>

03:26.400 --> 03:28.870
<i>Justice served!</i>

03:43.920 --> 03:47.910
<i>If I do that, the world will be</i>
<i>a better place.</i>

03:48.920 --> 03:52.290
<i>And I will create a world populated</i>
<i>only by kind, honest people</i>

03:52.360 --> 03:54.690
<i>who have received my approval.</i>

03:56.060 --> 03:57.330
<i>And I...</i>

03:59.740 --> 04:01.730
<i>will become</i>
<i>the god of the new world.</i>

04:02.200 --> 04:05.540
Death Note: Relight
Visions of a God

04:21.589 --> 04:23.420
Really? You went to see that?

04:23.830 --> 04:25.360
It was a real waste of time.

04:25.430 --> 04:27.130
I want to get my money back.

05:03.600 --> 05:05.000
<i>Death Note...</i>

05:05.800 --> 05:07.770
<i>Directly translated,</i>
<i>it means "notebook of death."</i>

05:11.170 --> 05:12.370
<i>"How to use..."</i>

05:13.180 --> 05:17.580
<i>"Those whose names are</i>
<i>written in this notebook will die."</i>

05:20.320 --> 05:21.410
<i>How silly...</i>

05:22.580 --> 05:24.820
<i>This is really sick...</i>

05:25.820 --> 05:29.020
<i>This isn't any better than</i>
<i>a chain letter...</i>

05:29.860 --> 05:32.590
<i>"Those whose names are written</i>
<i>in this notebook will die"?</i>

05:42.570 --> 05:45.970
<i>Jeez...something's wrong</i>
<i>with me, too...</i>

06:21.580 --> 06:24.550
Welcome home!
You're home early, Light.

06:25.050 --> 06:25.740
Yeah.

06:26.580 --> 06:28.480
I'm home, Mom.

06:31.490 --> 06:34.290
Oh...The results of
the national mock exam?

06:34.520 --> 06:35.620
Quickly!

06:36.660 --> 06:37.460
Here.

06:37.990 --> 06:40.020
Oh my, number one again!

06:40.460 --> 06:42.230
You really worked hard,
didn't you, Light?!

06:42.460 --> 06:43.490
Yeah.

06:43.700 --> 06:46.190
Well, I'm going to be studying,
so don't bother me.

06:46.440 --> 06:47.560
All right.

06:47.940 --> 06:51.130
Oh, Light. Do you want anything?

06:51.210 --> 06:52.500
I'll get you whatever you want.

06:52.770 --> 06:54.800
Nothing in particular, Mom.

06:57.980 --> 06:59.880
I already have what I want...

07:19.230 --> 07:20.830
I see you like it.

07:28.540 --> 07:30.480
Why are you so surprised?

07:31.310 --> 07:33.080
I'm Ryuk, a Shinigami.

07:33.150 --> 07:34.980
I'm the one who dropped
that notebook.

07:35.620 --> 07:37.450
Judging by the way you were acting...

07:37.520 --> 07:40.920
I think you already know that
that's no ordinary notebook.

07:47.500 --> 07:48.590
A Shinigami, huh?

07:52.900 --> 07:55.100
I'm not surprised, Ryuk.

07:56.170 --> 07:57.140
No...

07:58.010 --> 08:00.000
I've been waiting for you, Ryuk...

08:00.910 --> 08:01.840
Oh?

08:02.780 --> 08:07.680
I've had my doubts whether
the Shinigami notebook was real...

08:07.750 --> 08:12.880
But after seeing all sorts of things,
I'm confident in my actions...

08:13.790 --> 08:17.620
I see... You surprise me...

08:18.230 --> 08:21.720
I've heard that the Death Note
has appeared in the Human World

08:21.800 --> 08:24.100
many times in the past.

08:24.870 --> 08:28.430
But you're the first who's done
this much in just five days.

08:28.500 --> 08:30.900
Most people would have been too scared
to write this many names...

08:31.640 --> 08:33.400
I'm prepared, Ryuk.

08:34.010 --> 08:35.909
I used the notebook
with the knowledge

08:35.980 --> 08:37.140
that it belonged to a Shinigami.

08:37.409 --> 08:38.880
And now a Shinigami has come...

08:39.650 --> 08:42.620
What are you going to do to me?
Are you going to take my soul?

08:43.590 --> 08:48.150
Hm? What are you talking about?
Is that what humans think we're like?

08:49.220 --> 08:51.460
I won't do anything to you.

08:52.790 --> 08:55.160
As soon as the notebook
lands in the Human World,

08:55.230 --> 08:57.260
it becomes a part of it.

08:57.830 --> 09:00.930
In other words,
it belongs to you.

09:01.570 --> 09:03.200
It's...mine?

09:04.070 --> 09:06.130
If you don't want it,
pass it to another human.

09:06.710 --> 09:10.840
When you do,
I'll erase your memories of it.

09:11.480 --> 09:15.750
Then there really is no price
for using the Death Note?

09:16.690 --> 09:18.420
If anything...the pain and fear

09:18.490 --> 09:22.650
that only someone who used
the Death Note would know...

09:24.290 --> 09:26.060
And when you die...

09:26.530 --> 09:30.470
I'll write your name
in my notebook...

09:32.000 --> 09:34.530
Don't think that someone
who's used the Death Note

09:34.600 --> 09:37.600
can go to heaven or hell.

09:39.140 --> 09:40.130
That's all.

09:45.350 --> 09:47.370
Look forward to that when you die.

09:49.990 --> 09:53.580
This week alone, there have been
52 victims that we know of.

09:53.890 --> 09:55.880
They all died of heart attacks.

09:56.220 --> 09:59.850
There are probably some criminals
whose deaths aren't confirmed.

10:00.560 --> 10:02.960
- They were all criminals who...
- It's already started, Bureau Chief.

10:03.130 --> 10:04.430
probably would have been executed.

10:04.530 --> 10:06.430
- Yeah, I had a call from headquarters.
- Perhaps we shouldn't concern ourselves.

10:06.600 --> 10:07.630
How stupid!

10:07.700 --> 10:09.860
It doesn't matter if they're major criminals
or death row inmates.

10:09.940 --> 10:11.170
Murder is murder.

10:11.240 --> 10:13.470
We aren't sure that
it was murder yet.

10:13.540 --> 10:16.310
How can over a hundred people dying
of heart attacks be a coincidence?!

10:16.410 --> 10:20.580
There's nothing we can learn
from the way they've died.

10:20.650 --> 10:24.480
I agree! It would be different if
they had been stabbed with knifes!

10:25.020 --> 10:28.390
We have to get L to help us!

10:32.960 --> 10:35.400
Bureau Chief, who's L?

10:35.600 --> 10:38.620
Oh, this is your first time at
an Interpol meeting, isn't it?

10:39.130 --> 10:43.470
No one knows L's name,
location, or even what he looks like.

10:44.140 --> 10:48.100
Furthermore, he solves
any case no matter how difficult.

10:48.180 --> 10:51.110
He's solved many of
the world's unsolved cases.

10:51.180 --> 10:54.740
He's one of the world's secret elite
and last hope...

10:54.820 --> 10:56.310
Something like that...

10:57.520 --> 11:02.960
But L is an arrogant person
who only takes cases he's interested in!

11:03.290 --> 11:07.130
That's right.
And we have no way of contacting him!

11:07.430 --> 11:09.300
L is already on the move.

11:17.710 --> 11:21.170
L has already begun
to investigate this case.

11:21.740 --> 11:23.110
W-Watari...

11:23.250 --> 11:24.680
Huh? Watari?

11:25.080 --> 11:27.680
The only man who can contact L.

11:28.250 --> 11:31.050
Of course, no one knows
Watari's identity either...

11:31.490 --> 11:33.010
Please be silent.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.690
I shall let you hear L's voice
right now.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.060
<i>Members of Interpol...</i>

11:44.000 --> 11:44.990
<i>I am L.</i>

11:49.470 --> 11:51.500
The Legend of Kira the Savior...

11:51.570 --> 11:54.440
That's pretty cool...
Are they referring to you?

11:54.710 --> 11:58.340
Yeah, it seems "Kira" comes
from the word "killer."

11:58.880 --> 12:00.680
I don't really like that...

12:00.980 --> 12:03.780
But the world already
knows me as Kira.

12:04.450 --> 12:08.410
If you do an internet search on Kira,
you'll find thousands of pages like this.

12:09.160 --> 12:10.990
Television and newspapers
have only reported

12:11.060 --> 12:14.760
The Deepening Mystery...
A Sensation is Called Accident
Reconsidering the Investigative System
Mysterious Deaths Continue
the successive bizarre deaths
of vicious criminals.

12:15.530 --> 12:19.260
But everyone in
the world can sense it.

12:19.430 --> 12:21.900
That there's someone
who's seeking justice.

12:22.570 --> 12:23.540
Oh?

12:24.710 --> 12:25.970
This is good...

12:26.340 --> 12:28.870
Everything's going according
to plan.

12:29.710 --> 12:32.110
<i>We interrupt our program</i>
<i>to bring you</i>

12:32.180 --> 12:36.450
<i>a special live broadcast</i>
<i>from Interpol.</i>

12:36.620 --> 12:38.090
Huh? What's this?

12:38.550 --> 12:39.990
Interpol?

12:40.490 --> 12:41.720
<i>We're about to begin.</i>

12:43.090 --> 12:45.420
<i>I am Lind L. Taylor,</i>

12:45.490 --> 12:48.930
<i>the only person who can move</i>
<i>the entire world's police.</i>

12:49.800 --> 12:51.700
<i>I am otherwise known as "L."</i>

12:52.170 --> 12:54.570
Wh-Who is he?

12:55.300 --> 12:56.770
It's finally begun...

12:58.140 --> 13:00.800
<i>Someone has been systematically</i>
<i>murdering criminals.</i>

13:01.440 --> 13:03.500
<i>This is unforgivable.</i>

13:03.680 --> 13:05.940
<i>It is one of the greatest</i>
<i>criminal acts in history.</i>

13:06.010 --> 13:08.480
<i>Therefore, I intend to apprehend</i>
<i>the person responsible for these crimes...</i>

13:08.550 --> 13:11.650
<i>the person known as "Kira."</i>

13:11.990 --> 13:14.080
He says he's going to catch you.

13:15.160 --> 13:17.490
What an idiot.
He can't catch me.

13:18.290 --> 13:19.780
I have a Death Note.

13:19.860 --> 13:23.990
As long as I have this notebook,
I won't leave any proof behind.

13:24.330 --> 13:26.930
It's impossible to catch me.

13:28.740 --> 13:31.610
The police are getting involved
and this guy making an appearance...

13:31.670 --> 13:33.040
Everything's going according to plan.

13:33.410 --> 13:39.010
<i>Kira, I have a pretty good idea of</i>
<i>why you're doing this.</i>

13:39.910 --> 13:43.250
<i>But what you're doing is evil!</i>

13:45.320 --> 13:47.380
I'm evil?

13:49.620 --> 13:50.920
I am justice!

13:50.990 --> 13:53.290
I protect the weak who fear evil.

13:53.360 --> 13:55.350
I am the man who
will become...

13:55.430 --> 13:56.900
the god of the ideal, new world!

13:57.000 --> 13:58.970
And all those who oppose this god...

13:59.130 --> 14:00.400
are evil!

14:02.940 --> 14:04.700
You're too foolish, L...

14:05.070 --> 14:06.910
It would have been
a little more interesting

14:06.980 --> 14:09.140
if you'd have been
a little smarter...

14:24.290 --> 14:27.160
I'll show you what happens
if you defy me...

14:27.660 --> 14:31.000
The whole world is watching, L.

14:35.500 --> 14:36.630
Five more seconds.

14:37.170 --> 14:40.730
4...3...2...1...

14:53.790 --> 14:56.090
What's wrong?
Why don't you say something?!

15:01.030 --> 15:02.360
<i>Unbelievable...</i>

15:03.300 --> 15:06.860
<i>I was just testing to make sure,</i>
<i>but I didn't think it was possible...</i>

15:07.470 --> 15:11.840
<i>Kira...you can kill by indirect means...</i>

15:13.240 --> 15:16.270
<i>Had I not seen it with my own eyes,</i>
<i>I would have never believed it.</i>

15:17.250 --> 15:18.650
<i>Listen closely, Kira.</i>

15:18.710 --> 15:24.050
<i>If you have killed the man</i>
<i>on your screen, Lind L. Taylor,</i>

15:24.120 --> 15:27.650
<i>you just killed a man who was</i>
<i>to be executed today at this time.</i>

15:28.420 --> 15:29.790
<i>Not me.</i>

15:29.960 --> 15:31.020
What?!

15:31.090 --> 15:33.290
<i>It hasn't been reported</i>
<i>on television or the internet.</i>

15:33.830 --> 15:36.490
<i>He's a criminal that the police</i>
<i>caught in secret.</i>

15:37.030 --> 15:41.300
<i>Even you weren't able</i>
<i>to gather information on him.</i>

15:43.540 --> 15:44.730
He tricked you.

15:45.440 --> 15:48.640
<i>But I... L, do exist!</i>

15:49.880 --> 15:51.710
<i>Now try to kill me!</i>

15:52.580 --> 15:54.410
Th-That bastard!

15:54.980 --> 15:56.040
<i>What's wrong?</i>

15:56.120 --> 15:57.920
<i>- Hurry up and do it!</i>
- What is this?! This is incredible!

15:58.090 --> 15:59.950
<i>- Quickly! Try to kill me!</i>
- Are you trying to get yourself killed, L?!

16:00.020 --> 16:00.920
What's going on?!

16:01.020 --> 16:03.790
<i>What's wrong?</i>
<i>Kill me right now!</i>

16:03.960 --> 16:06.890
<i>- Kill me right now!</i>
- It's Kira versus L!

16:08.230 --> 16:10.100
<i>Can't you do it?</i>

16:13.070 --> 16:15.560
<i>It seems that you can't kill me...</i>

16:16.440 --> 16:18.530
There are some people
you can't kill...

16:19.310 --> 16:21.330
You've given me a good hint.

16:21.580 --> 16:25.670
<i>In return, I'll tell you</i>
<i>something interesting.</i>

16:26.310 --> 16:29.980
<i>I said that this broadcast was</i>
<i>being aired live around the world...</i>

16:30.050 --> 16:33.180
<i>But actually, was only broadcast</i>
<i>in Japan's Kanto region.</i>

16:34.420 --> 16:36.320
<i>I was planning on airing this broadcast</i>
<i>in other regions at different times,</i>

16:36.390 --> 16:38.380
<i>but it seems that there's no need</i>
<i>for that anymore.</i>

16:38.990 --> 16:41.960
<i>You're in Kanto right now.</i>

16:43.360 --> 16:44.890
L's pretty good.

16:45.470 --> 16:49.770
<i>I never thought that things</i>
<i>would go quite so well.</i>

16:49.970 --> 16:54.810
<i>But, Kira, it seems that it might</i>
<i>not be too long till I get you executed.</i>

16:55.040 --> 16:57.770
I knew it... L is just as
I had expected he would be...

16:57.980 --> 17:01.280
Yes. He's proved Kira's existence,
that the killings took place,

17:01.350 --> 17:03.940
and that Kira's in Japan...

17:04.990 --> 17:10.319
<i>Kira, I'm very interested in</i>
<i>what method you use to kill.</i>

17:11.290 --> 17:12.450
<i>But I'll find that out...</i>

17:12.530 --> 17:14.960
...when I catch you.

17:15.960 --> 17:18.490
<i>Until we meet again, Kira.</i>

17:30.650 --> 17:33.120
Light, do you have a minute?

17:33.480 --> 17:36.420
Ryuk, I told you not to talk
to me outside.

17:37.050 --> 17:38.610
How many times do I have
to remind you?

17:38.820 --> 17:41.050
Then I'll just talk to you.

17:41.560 --> 17:44.030
Close your ears if
you don't want to listen.

17:47.530 --> 17:50.860
Someone's been following you
for a while now.

18:23.500 --> 18:24.590
I'm L.

18:24.800 --> 18:26.200
<i>This man is...?</i>

18:26.900 --> 18:28.890
<i>He looks different from</i>
<i>what I imagined...</i>

18:32.740 --> 18:34.510
I'm Yagami of the Police Department.

18:35.180 --> 18:36.440
Oh, I'm Matsuda.

18:36.510 --> 18:37.450
I'm Aizawa.

18:37.510 --> 18:38.450
I'm Mogi.

18:38.510 --> 18:39.450
I'm Ukita.

18:41.080 --> 18:44.210
I'm sorry we're late.
These five are the current...

18:45.990 --> 18:46.680
Wha?!

18:46.760 --> 18:47.880
What are you doing?!

18:49.530 --> 18:53.690
You'd be dead if I were Kira,
Mr. Soichiro Yagami.

18:55.500 --> 18:58.260
Kira needs a face and
a name in order to kill.

18:58.870 --> 19:01.170
You should already know that.

19:01.970 --> 19:04.130
Don't say your name so casually.

19:04.910 --> 19:10.010
Also, when you refer to me,
call me Ryuzaki, not L.

19:11.110 --> 19:12.740
This is just another precaution.

19:13.120 --> 19:14.310
Now then, come in...

19:24.630 --> 19:25.690
Now then...

19:25.760 --> 19:28.530
It's been a month since the live
investigation we performed on TV.

19:29.230 --> 19:31.290
Let's sort out the things that
have happened since then.

19:33.070 --> 19:34.930
First, December 10.

19:35.840 --> 19:38.830
Twenty-three criminals in prisons across
the country were killed

19:38.910 --> 19:41.240
one by one, at exactly every hour
after the previous death...

19:44.280 --> 19:47.510
Since students are too preoccupied
during the day,

19:47.580 --> 19:51.180
the times of death almost convinced me
that Kira wasn't a student...

19:52.420 --> 19:59.020
But this made me realize
two major things.

19:59.900 --> 20:04.490
One is that Kira can freely control
his victim's time of death.

20:04.570 --> 20:06.000
And the other...

20:06.070 --> 20:09.100
is that Kira is childish and
hates to lose.

20:11.540 --> 20:14.200
Huh? You're not using
the Death Note today.

20:14.640 --> 20:16.440
Are you studying for
those entrance exams?

20:16.580 --> 20:19.780
It's useless to study
for those at this point.

20:20.280 --> 20:22.010
Hmm. So what are you doing?

20:22.950 --> 20:25.250
Here's the problem.

20:26.490 --> 20:29.950
On December 14,
twelve FBI investigators entered Japan...

20:30.030 --> 20:32.930
to investigate Kira.

20:33.660 --> 20:36.500
And on the 27th...

20:37.230 --> 20:38.790
they all died.

20:40.240 --> 20:43.070
<i>I've done a lot during this period.</i>

20:43.810 --> 20:46.110
Shibuya - Shinagawa

20:46.180 --> 20:49.040
<i>Mr. Raye Penber,</i>
<i>this is Kira.</i>

20:49.110 --> 20:50.700
<i>I've looked you up.</i>

20:51.480 --> 20:54.470
<i>If you deviate even the slightest</i>
<i>from my instructions,</i>

20:54.550 --> 20:57.680
<i>I will kill your entire family.</i>

20:58.450 --> 20:59.980
<i>You included, of course...</i>

21:03.590 --> 21:05.560
<i>What is this?!</i>

21:06.160 --> 21:09.290
<i>Your superior will send you</i>
<i>a file soon.</i>

21:09.970 --> 21:12.400
The file contains the names and faces...

21:12.470 --> 21:14.660
<i>of the FBI investigators who</i>
<i>entered Japan.</i>

21:15.100 --> 21:18.560
<i>Look closely at</i>
<i>each investigator's face as you...</i>

21:18.640 --> 21:20.470
write their names onto
the envelope.

21:42.260 --> 21:44.530
Good bye, Raye Penber.

21:49.640 --> 21:51.830
<i>I handed him...</i>

21:51.910 --> 21:55.070
<i>the Death Note with causes of death</i>
<i>already written in it.</i>

21:55.980 --> 21:59.420
<i>Raye Penber, you're the one...</i>

21:59.480 --> 22:01.420
<i>who killed your colleagues.</i>

22:17.370 --> 22:18.660
Yes, it's me.

22:19.500 --> 22:21.160
Sorry, but could you do that for me?

22:21.870 --> 22:23.840
Yagami
All right, I got it.

22:24.170 --> 22:25.730
I'll get it sent over immediately.

22:26.680 --> 22:29.170
Sayu... could you do me
a small favor?

22:30.210 --> 22:32.550
What? Right now?

22:32.680 --> 22:35.580
Your father's been pulling all-nighters
without a change of clothes.

22:35.650 --> 22:37.180
Take some over to him.

22:37.250 --> 22:40.250
I've promised my friends that
I'd go to <i>hatsumoude</i> with them.

22:40.360 --> 22:42.760
I'll go.
I need a change of pace.

22:42.960 --> 22:45.990
How lucky!
Thanks, big brother.

22:55.670 --> 22:56.830
Say...

22:57.170 --> 23:00.570
It's true that you were
a splendid FBI investigator.

23:01.080 --> 23:03.640
But right now,
you're just my fiancée...

23:04.080 --> 23:07.740
Don't discuss the Kira case.
Don't do anything dangerous.

23:08.550 --> 23:09.950
That's what we agreed on...

23:10.020 --> 23:14.080
when I took you with me
so we could meet your parents.

23:14.860 --> 23:18.950
All right, Raye.
It's force of habit. Sorry.

23:19.600 --> 23:22.860
Oh... Sorry.
Don't let it bother you so much...

23:23.470 --> 23:24.900
Once we have a family,

23:24.970 --> 23:28.230
you'll be so busy that you'll forget
about your time as an investigator.

23:28.840 --> 23:30.930
There'll be no time for such habits.

23:36.510 --> 23:37.670
Kasumigaseki
<i>Raye...</i>

23:39.450 --> 23:40.610
<i>died.</i>

23:41.050 --> 23:42.210
National Public Safety Committee
Police Department

23:42.280 --> 23:43.220
<i>No...</i>

23:46.050 --> 23:48.790
<i>He was killed by Kira...</i>

23:51.560 --> 23:53.120
<i>- The number you have called...</i>

23:53.200 --> 23:55.320
<i>- cannot be reached at the moment.</i>
- How unusual for Dad.

23:57.930 --> 24:00.200
National Public Safety Committee
Police Department
I wonder if he's at
an important meeting...

24:02.600 --> 24:03.970
I beg you!

24:04.240 --> 24:07.870
I need to meet someone from
investigation headquarters in person.

24:08.510 --> 24:11.000
It concerns something important
about the Kira case.

24:11.580 --> 24:12.570
<i>The Kira case?</i>

24:15.950 --> 24:19.080
I'm Light. My father is Soichiro Yagami
of the Detective Bureau.

24:19.690 --> 24:22.020
These are my father's change of clothes,
but he doesn't seem to be here.

24:22.090 --> 24:23.080
Could you hold on to them for him?

24:23.660 --> 24:25.860
Oh, Light, it's been a while.

24:26.430 --> 24:28.620
There's no one at headquarters.

24:29.630 --> 24:33.030
Trust me a little.
I'll tell them for you.

24:33.670 --> 24:36.000
That's no good.
I need to tell them in person.

24:38.140 --> 24:40.770
My father is leading
the Kira investigation.

24:40.840 --> 24:43.310
Would you like to leave
a message with me?

24:43.980 --> 24:47.040
His cell phone is off,
so I can't tell him immediately...

24:48.020 --> 24:51.320
But they're probably busy since
several FBI agents were killed and

24:51.390 --> 24:55.380
there have been a lot of investigators
quitting the case out of fear of Kira.

24:56.020 --> 24:58.720
Light, you shouldn't tell those sorts
of things to civilians....

24:59.390 --> 25:02.090
There are already rumors about it.

25:02.530 --> 25:04.360
Besides, she's trustworthy.

25:04.770 --> 25:06.330
I can tell by looking at her eyes.

25:06.900 --> 25:08.670
She's a very wise and
careful person.

25:12.440 --> 25:15.310
You really are brave.

25:15.880 --> 25:18.070
You're trying to get involved
in the Kira case.

25:18.410 --> 25:19.400
Not really...

25:20.020 --> 25:25.280
Umm, may I ask what your name is?
I'm Light Yagami.

25:25.850 --> 25:28.720
It's written as "moon," but read as Light,
with "night" and "God."

25:29.290 --> 25:31.690
I'm Shoko Maki.
"shining," with <i>ko</i> as in "child,"

25:31.760 --> 25:34.630
and "space" with <i>ki</i> as in "tree."

25:35.160 --> 25:36.790
Ms. Maki, right?

25:39.230 --> 25:43.330
Ms. Maki, I think that
Kira's power is...

25:43.710 --> 25:47.470
the ability to control his victims
before he kills them.

25:47.740 --> 25:52.440
Yes. And he probably needs a face
and a name in order to kill.

25:53.150 --> 25:56.640
Yes. Kira probably found out
the names and faces

25:56.720 --> 26:00.620
of the FBI agents in some way...
and killed them.

26:00.990 --> 26:04.890
Yes. My fiancé was one of them.

26:06.760 --> 26:10.260
Upon inspecting the surveillance footage
taken the day he died...

26:11.230 --> 26:13.790
I noticed that he had left
the envelope he had with him

26:13.870 --> 26:16.130
at the ticket booth and the platform
on the train.

26:17.810 --> 26:20.900
Kira probably took the file
concerning the FBI agents

26:20.980 --> 26:23.710
on the train and killed them.

26:24.910 --> 26:26.040
When Raye died,

26:26.110 --> 26:28.850
he was desperately trying
to look into the train.

26:30.190 --> 26:32.950
Kira was probably there.

26:34.960 --> 26:36.550
In other words,

26:36.630 --> 26:41.060
the person in the train that
Raye was looking at was Kira!

26:57.180 --> 26:59.170
Good work, everyone.

27:00.150 --> 27:02.120
Th-This is Watari?

27:02.550 --> 27:04.580
Umm, what happened to
the clothes you usually wear?

27:05.120 --> 27:08.680
That look gives away the fact
that I am Watari...

27:08.960 --> 27:12.220
It'll let people know
that Ryuzaki is in this hotel...

27:12.830 --> 27:14.300
I-I see.

27:18.330 --> 27:20.330
<i>However she came to</i>
<i>her conclusions...</i>

27:20.400 --> 27:22.560
<i>this woman knows the truth.</i>

27:24.110 --> 27:25.470
<i>I've got to get rid of her.</i>

27:26.310 --> 27:27.670
What's wrong?

27:29.180 --> 27:30.650
Oh, nothing...

27:32.550 --> 27:35.950
I reexamined what you just told me
and I'm beginning to think

27:36.020 --> 27:39.180
that we should quickly investigate
that line of thought.

27:40.220 --> 27:41.320
R-Really?

27:41.660 --> 27:44.720
Yes...Have you told this
to anyone else?

27:45.030 --> 27:47.220
No. You're the first.

27:49.100 --> 27:52.590
You're lucky.
But how are you going to get rid of her?

27:52.770 --> 27:54.700
Can't do it right here and now.

27:54.900 --> 27:56.840
<i>You don't need to tell me that.</i>

27:56.970 --> 27:58.370
I've already thought about that.

27:58.910 --> 28:00.810
Oh, how bold.

28:01.680 --> 28:05.110
Could you tell me the day and time
your fiancé rode the train?

28:05.480 --> 28:08.640
December 27, 15:13.

28:09.120 --> 28:12.450
The Yamanote Line from
Shinjuku to Shibuya.

28:13.290 --> 28:15.520
December 27...

28:16.090 --> 28:18.860
The Yamanote Line to Shibuya...

28:19.060 --> 28:20.030
Yes.

28:20.230 --> 28:26.290
Shoko Maki Suicide January 1, 2007
From 1:15 PM,
so that you don't trouble anyone,
think of a place where nobody
will find your body,
and decide on the best way
to kill yourself.
Commit suicide within forty-eight hours.

28:30.770 --> 28:33.140
<i>Ten more seconds until 1:15...</i>

28:36.040 --> 28:39.450
<i>Now hurry to your death.</i>

28:57.070 --> 28:59.830
<i>What's wrong?</i>
<i>The time's already past.</i>

29:03.470 --> 29:06.570
<i>This is odd.</i>
<i>Why isn't this woman moving?</i>

29:12.480 --> 29:13.540
<i>An alias!</i>

29:15.220 --> 29:17.310
<i>An alias. That's got to be it!</i>

29:17.990 --> 29:21.250
<i>Ryuk can see</i>
<i>the woman's real name.</i>

29:21.890 --> 29:22.980
<i>This is bad...</i>

29:23.490 --> 29:26.050
<i>It's difficult to get someone</i>
<i>to reveal their real name</i>

29:26.130 --> 29:27.890
<i>once they're given an alias...</i>

29:28.330 --> 29:32.670
Light, I can perform
the eye bargain any time.

29:33.400 --> 29:36.860
Yes, the bargain to give you
Shinigami's eyes

29:36.940 --> 29:38.910
which will allow you to
see people's names...

29:38.970 --> 29:41.310
It's no different than
putting in contacts.

29:41.610 --> 29:43.130
It'll only take a few seconds.

29:44.110 --> 29:48.480
<i>I won't halve my remaining lifespan</i>
<i>over this woman.</i>

29:49.280 --> 29:51.980
<i>Don't interfere.</i>
<i>Be quiet, Shinigami!</i>

29:52.820 --> 29:54.620
- Pardon...
- Yes?

29:55.090 --> 29:57.960
Actually, there's something
I still haven't told you.

29:58.360 --> 29:59.380
Okay...

30:00.260 --> 30:04.390
It's impossible to talk to anyone
from headquarters in person.

30:04.870 --> 30:05.630
Huh?

30:05.830 --> 30:08.240
The Kira investigation team
has a system

30:08.300 --> 30:11.600
that prevents anyone from
knowing who's in charge.

30:14.080 --> 30:16.770
I knew you'd say something clever, Light.

30:17.010 --> 30:20.040
Why do you know so much
about them?

30:21.480 --> 30:23.750
I guess it can't be helped.
I'll tell you.

30:24.950 --> 30:27.350
I'm a member of the investigative team.

30:28.660 --> 30:31.020
You're a member of
the investigative team?

30:31.490 --> 30:34.520
L was troubled by the lack
of members on the team.

30:35.460 --> 30:38.130
Everyone had quit because
they were afraid of Kira.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.940
I'm still a high school student...

30:41.000 --> 30:45.740
but I've assisted the police in solving
two cases in the past.

30:46.310 --> 30:48.300
And he was impressed by that?

30:49.210 --> 30:50.180
Yes.

30:52.410 --> 30:55.040
I see... That makes sense...

30:57.250 --> 31:00.980
Actually, two years ago
I also worked with L

31:01.060 --> 31:03.080
on a certain case in America.

31:04.260 --> 31:05.960
You worked with L?

31:06.900 --> 31:11.800
Until just three months ago,
I was an FBI investigator.

31:13.130 --> 31:15.870
<i>This is it... I can use this.</i>

31:16.640 --> 31:18.370
So that's it.

31:18.440 --> 31:21.070
No wonder. You don't have the attitude
and demeanor

31:21.140 --> 31:23.010
of an amateur detective.

31:24.680 --> 31:26.980
I've decided that I should
approach this in my own way.

31:27.050 --> 31:29.140
I must suspect the police and

31:29.280 --> 31:31.690
even the people on
the investigation team.

31:32.390 --> 31:34.750
But I can believe L.

31:36.160 --> 31:41.690
I sense something in you...
that is similar to L.

31:48.240 --> 31:50.070
Shall we investigate
this case together?

31:51.710 --> 31:54.940
Would you like to be a member
of the investigative team as well?

31:56.240 --> 31:58.940
Of course, not everyone can join.

31:59.350 --> 32:02.180
Yes, we need someone like you.

32:02.680 --> 32:06.280
You should be doing more than
just gathering general information.

32:06.650 --> 32:09.590
I feel it was fate to meet you here!

32:10.590 --> 32:12.190
I shall recommend you!

32:16.160 --> 32:19.660
Oh, sorry. I got a bit excited...

32:20.300 --> 32:23.070
But you're still young and beautiful.

32:23.610 --> 32:25.130
I can't let you take on such
a dangerous investigation...

32:25.410 --> 32:28.380
No! I don't have anything to lose.

32:28.580 --> 32:32.380
I want to catch Kira!
That is all I want to do!

32:32.780 --> 32:34.650
Please let me join your investigation!

32:43.960 --> 32:45.090
That's good.

32:45.930 --> 32:49.130
Then could I see something that may
act as personal identification?

32:49.800 --> 32:52.230
Would a Japanese driver's license
be all right?

32:52.400 --> 32:53.330
Yes.

33:12.490 --> 33:13.750
<i>I made it in time...</i>

33:30.310 --> 33:34.170
Umm, why are you concerned
about the time?

33:34.810 --> 33:39.370
Oh...this? Well, that's because...

33:42.750 --> 33:43.720
I'm Kira.

34:07.910 --> 34:09.000
What's wrong?

34:10.480 --> 34:12.500
There's something that I have to do.

34:14.750 --> 34:17.650
Good bye, Ms. Naomi Misora.

34:40.350 --> 34:44.150
Yes. Yes. Please wait one moment.

34:44.550 --> 34:47.350
Ryuzaki. Mr. Ukita,
from the police department...

34:47.420 --> 34:51.590
Is now taking a phone call concerning
some curious information.

34:52.630 --> 34:54.260
Raye Penber's fiancée?

34:55.100 --> 34:56.290
Naomi Misora...

34:57.130 --> 34:58.860
I've heard that name somewhere...

35:02.370 --> 35:06.710
<i>It's her... She's from the Los Angeles</i>
<i>BB murder case.</i>

35:10.750 --> 35:14.740
She disappeared the day after
the death of her fiancé...

35:15.080 --> 35:17.780
Anyone would be depressed
if their fiancé died.

35:18.020 --> 35:18.950
You don't think that she...

35:19.120 --> 35:20.110
...killed herself?

35:20.390 --> 35:23.220
No, the Naomi Misora I knew

35:23.290 --> 35:26.190
was an excellent,
strong-willed FBI investigator.

35:26.900 --> 35:29.920
She's probably thinking
of catching Kira.

35:30.600 --> 35:32.500
It seems that she was with Penber.

35:33.370 --> 35:35.070
She might have figured something out.

35:36.170 --> 35:39.070
<i>If that's the case,</i>
<i>did Kira get to her first?</i>

35:42.110 --> 35:45.140
Everyone, from here on,
we're only going to investigate

35:45.210 --> 35:47.580
the people that Raye Penber
was investigating in Japan.

35:48.320 --> 35:49.720
He was investigating two people

35:49.790 --> 35:51.910
in relation to the police
and the people around them...

35:52.660 --> 35:54.820
Who are they?
Who are those two?

35:56.090 --> 35:59.120
Vice-Chief Kitamura and
his family, and...

35:59.430 --> 36:01.590
Bureau Chief Yagami and his family.

36:03.730 --> 36:05.790
I also wish to...

36:05.870 --> 36:09.030
place wiretaps and surveillance cameras
in both households.

36:10.410 --> 36:11.870
See you later, Light.

36:11.940 --> 36:13.810
All right. See you tomorrow.

36:17.050 --> 36:19.070
<i>What's this? No one's home?</i>

36:27.690 --> 36:28.820
I'm home...

36:45.870 --> 36:48.740
Say, Light, no one seems to be home.

36:48.810 --> 36:50.910
Let's play a game.
We haven't in a while.

36:52.410 --> 36:53.540
Are you listening?

36:58.420 --> 37:00.050
I-It can't be...

37:00.460 --> 37:02.290
I never knew that
he was doing that!

37:02.860 --> 37:06.190
Does he have something in his room
that he doesn't want anyone to see?

37:06.330 --> 37:10.290
It's not that strange if
you consider that he's seventeen.

37:11.070 --> 37:13.060
I used to do that for no reason at all.

37:14.200 --> 37:15.500
Hey, Light.

37:15.570 --> 37:18.510
You've been ignoring me.
I'm getting angry.

37:19.940 --> 37:22.380
<i>- No wiretaps planted on these clothes.</i>
- Hey, Light!

37:22.910 --> 37:23.940
Light!

37:24.010 --> 37:26.210
Ryuk, there's a possibility that

37:26.280 --> 37:28.680
there are surveillance cameras
or wiretaps in the house...

37:28.750 --> 37:31.050
No, it's probably both.

37:31.250 --> 37:34.850
Whenever I close my room door,
I always leave the door knob

37:34.920 --> 37:37.480
five millimeters below
its highest position.

37:38.330 --> 37:39.820
In other words,

37:39.900 --> 37:41.920
when I open the door,
if the knob is all the way up,

37:42.000 --> 37:44.360
there's a possibility that someone
has been in my room.

37:44.570 --> 37:46.060
Are you sure it wasn't your parents?

37:46.140 --> 37:48.660
My parents and my sister wouldn't
even notice the slip of paper.

37:48.840 --> 37:50.670
It's suspicious that someone
would take the time

37:50.740 --> 37:52.170
to place the piece of paper
back where it was.

37:53.410 --> 37:55.940
By the way, Ryuk,
what will you do about your apples?

37:56.040 --> 37:56.940
Apples?

37:57.010 --> 37:59.170
Shinigami don't die,
so they don't starve.

37:59.720 --> 38:02.150
In other words, there's no problem
if I don't give you apples.

38:02.550 --> 38:04.650
H-Hold on a second, Light!

38:05.050 --> 38:06.950
Apples are like...

38:07.660 --> 38:11.490
W-Well... like alcohol and cigarettes
are to humans.

38:11.560 --> 38:13.930
I get withdrawal symptoms
if I don't have any for a while.

38:14.360 --> 38:16.460
If you really want to eat apples...

38:18.700 --> 38:21.300
find the location of all the cameras.

38:21.670 --> 38:25.300
There may be a place
where you can eat apples.

38:26.640 --> 38:28.010
Let's go, Ryuk.

38:29.240 --> 38:31.540
Okay! Finding cameras.

38:31.610 --> 38:34.550
This is also amusing!

38:39.620 --> 38:42.250
<i>I love you.</i>

38:48.160 --> 38:50.390
Hideki Ryuga, you're so dreamy!

38:50.470 --> 38:53.830
There's nobody in my classes like him!
At all!

38:53.900 --> 38:55.960
Sayu, eat your dinner.

38:56.370 --> 38:58.030
Later.

38:58.340 --> 39:01.400
Mr. Aizawa, are the Kitamuras
watching television now?

39:02.010 --> 39:02.740
<i>Yes.</i>

39:02.850 --> 39:04.400
Aside from the second eldest,

39:04.480 --> 39:06.070
four of them are watching
television as they eat.

39:06.380 --> 39:07.350
It's channel four.

39:08.550 --> 39:12.650
Watari, order various television stations
to broadcast our transcription.

39:12.890 --> 39:13.980
All right.

39:14.290 --> 39:15.720
NKK News Flash
<i>That's right. I...</i>

39:15.790 --> 39:17.420
Huh? What?

39:18.260 --> 39:22.960
"In response to the Kira murders,
Interpol has decided to dispatch

39:23.030 --> 39:29.900
"1,500 investigators from
various countries to Japan."

39:31.070 --> 39:33.940
1,500 investigators?

39:34.740 --> 39:37.980
<i>L... He's using the same method</i>
<i>as the first time.</i>

39:38.980 --> 39:40.640
Interpol is silly.

39:40.850 --> 39:41.650
Huh?

39:42.450 --> 39:44.580
There's no point in making
this announcement.

39:44.650 --> 39:46.520
If they're going to send them in,

39:46.590 --> 39:48.490
they should let them come in
and investigate in secret.

39:48.760 --> 39:52.250
<i>Even undercover FBI investigators</i>
<i>met untimely ends.</i>

39:52.660 --> 39:54.600
<i>These investigators could</i>
<i>meet the same fate.</i>

39:54.660 --> 39:57.220
<i>This is just an overblown</i>
<i>attempt by the police</i>

39:57.300 --> 40:00.130
<i>to shock Kira into exposing himself.</i>

40:00.670 --> 40:03.400
<i>But this probably looks suspicious</i>
<i>to Kira.</i>

40:06.540 --> 40:08.570
Your son is very smart.

40:08.880 --> 40:10.970
Huh? Yes, he is.

40:14.550 --> 40:18.820
L-Light... I found all of the cameras.

40:19.190 --> 40:21.850
Shinigami sure get tired
when they try hard...

40:22.390 --> 40:23.980
I'll explain now.

40:24.230 --> 40:27.460
It's a pain to explain
so listen well.

40:28.260 --> 40:30.320
There are an amazing number
of cameras.

40:30.970 --> 40:34.630
I can only think that the guy who placed
them expected some to be found.

40:34.800 --> 40:36.800
There are sixty-four in all.

40:37.510 --> 40:40.870
So where can I eat apples
in this situation?

40:40.980 --> 40:43.140
<i>It's impossible, Ryuk...</i>

40:43.450 --> 40:46.310
Oh, you can't talk to me in the house...

40:47.020 --> 40:49.310
Tell me tomorrow when we go outside.

40:49.620 --> 40:52.250
Okay. This problem is also correct.

40:52.720 --> 40:55.280
<i>Judging from the number of cameras</i>
<i>and their placement,</i>

40:55.360 --> 40:57.950
<i>he's planning on making his decision</i>
<i>in a short amount of time...</i>

40:58.460 --> 41:01.360
<i>A normal person would</i>
<i>give himself away,</i>

41:01.900 --> 41:03.890
<i>but things won't be so easy</i>
<i>against me, L.</i>

41:04.030 --> 41:05.130
<i>Just you watch!</i>

41:20.780 --> 41:22.480
<i>I've written in the Deathnote</i>

41:22.550 --> 41:24.880
<i>so criminals die for</i>
<i>the next three weeks...</i>

41:25.420 --> 41:29.190
<i>Kira has shown that he can control</i>
<i>his victim's time of death...</i>

41:29.590 --> 41:30.920
<i>So in this case,</i>

41:30.990 --> 41:33.360
<i>Criminals being newly broadcast</i>

41:33.430 --> 41:36.960
<i>have to die when I haven't</i>
<i>had any knowledge of them.</i>

41:37.630 --> 41:38.690
This is bad.

41:38.770 --> 41:40.100
It's my withdrawal symptoms!

41:41.370 --> 41:43.030
<i>I'm going to do this, L!</i>

41:48.840 --> 41:51.310
<i>With Ryuk's information</i>
<i>and prior planning...</i>

41:51.380 --> 41:55.080
<i>I can kill criminals being broadcast,</i>

41:55.150 --> 42:00.680
<i>while masquerading</i>
<i>as a regular exam student!</i>

42:01.390 --> 42:03.450
<i>I'll solve equations with my right hand...</i>

42:03.530 --> 42:06.050
<i>and write names with my left.</i>

42:07.060 --> 42:08.330
Suspect: Takichi Murao

42:10.270 --> 42:12.630
<i>I'll take a potato chip...</i>
<i>and eat it!</i>

42:23.850 --> 42:27.150
After dinner, your son didn't
watch TV or use the computer.

42:27.220 --> 42:28.650
He's just studying...

42:29.080 --> 42:31.680
That's because it's less than
ten days until the Center Test...

42:41.530 --> 42:44.000
<i>Now a criminal whom</i>
<i>I shouldn't know about</i>

42:44.070 --> 42:45.970
<i>will die of a heart attack</i>
<i>in forty seconds.</i>

42:47.540 --> 42:50.510
<i>L himself will be a witness to my alibi.</i>

42:57.810 --> 43:00.440
Just now, a bank clerk suspected
of embezzlement

43:00.520 --> 43:03.780
died of a heart attack
during questioning.

43:03.850 --> 43:06.410
He was shown for the first time
today on the nine o' clock news.

43:06.590 --> 43:07.520
It's Kira!

43:07.660 --> 43:12.790
Today, Kira killed people with light crimes
as soon as they were broadcast...

43:14.560 --> 43:17.190
Even if it is the first day
since the cameras were placed,

43:17.270 --> 43:19.790
the Yagami household
is interestingly in the clear.

43:31.250 --> 43:33.720
Next is the Naomi Misora incident...

43:33.790 --> 43:35.950
Shouldn't we begin
a public investigation?

43:36.590 --> 43:39.120
If we are to do that, it should be done
separately from the Kira case.

43:39.200 --> 43:41.760
We should avoid releasing photographs
and use sketches of her instead.

43:42.670 --> 43:43.660
Ryuzaki.

43:44.000 --> 43:46.870
Turn the channel to Sakura TV.
Something terrible is happening.

43:48.270 --> 43:51.470
<i>In other words,</i>
<i>we are all Kira's hostages.</i>

43:51.540 --> 43:55.000
<i>It is also our duty as broadcasters</i>
<i>to make you this announcement.</i>

43:55.450 --> 43:57.380
<i>Please understand that</i>
<i>this is not a hoax and</i>

43:57.450 --> 44:01.110
<i>- that this is not a publicity stunt.</i>
- Kira's hostages?

44:01.650 --> 44:03.050
What is this?

44:03.690 --> 44:05.020
<i>Four days ago,</i>

44:05.090 --> 44:07.610
<i>our program director was</i>
<i>sent these four tapes.</i>

44:07.760 --> 44:09.850
<i>- These are ummistakenly from Kira.</i>
<i>- Sixty percent ratings?</i>

44:09.930 --> 44:12.160
<i>No, it'll go up to seventy percent.</i>

44:12.500 --> 44:15.930
<i>A tape that proves he is Kira</i>
<i>by predicting killings,</i>

44:16.130 --> 44:20.260
Message
Four videotapes
<i>and another with a message</i>
<i>to the people of the world.</i>

44:21.400 --> 44:23.240
Do you suppose it's just
another fake documentary?

44:23.440 --> 44:27.540
It couldn't be.
Who would make such a nasty fake?

44:27.880 --> 44:29.110
<i>Now, take a look.</i>

44:37.150 --> 44:38.620
<i>I am Kira.</i>

44:39.060 --> 44:44.490
<i>If this video is aired on</i>
<i>April 18, at exactly 5:59 PM,</i>

44:44.560 --> 44:49.430
<i>the time now is 5:59:47...</i>
<i>48...49...</i>

44:50.300 --> 44:52.630
<i>Please change</i>
<i>the channel to Taiyo TV.</i>

44:53.000 --> 44:55.400
<i>The main newscaster,</i>
<i>Mr. Kazuhiko Hibima</i>

44:55.470 --> 44:57.700
<i>will die of a heart attack</i>
<i>at exactly six o'clock.</i>

44:58.510 --> 44:59.170
Change it!

44:59.240 --> 45:00.680
- Hey!
- Someone!

45:00.880 --> 45:01.710
It can't be...!

45:02.850 --> 45:05.310
Something bad will happen
if we don't stop this broadcast!

45:06.880 --> 45:08.320
Get Sakura TV on the line!

45:09.820 --> 45:10.620
It's no good.

45:11.020 --> 45:13.750
No one I know at the station
has their cell phones on.

45:14.020 --> 45:15.890
The lines at the station
are all busy!

45:16.190 --> 45:17.130
Crap!

45:18.630 --> 45:19.360
Mr. Ukita!

45:19.430 --> 45:21.900
I'll go to the station and
stop this at the source!

45:23.670 --> 45:25.730
<i>Everyone, please listen to me.</i>

45:26.240 --> 45:28.830
<i>I don't want to kill innocents.</i>

45:29.670 --> 45:33.230
<i>I intend to</i>
<i>create a world without evil.</i>

45:34.010 --> 45:37.470
<i>If everyone cooperates,</i>
<i>this will be simple.</i>

45:37.550 --> 45:38.240
Crap!

45:39.280 --> 45:43.380
<i>If no one tries to catch me,</i>
<i>innocents will not die.</i>

45:44.220 --> 45:46.690
<i>Please be patient.</i>

45:47.220 --> 45:51.020
<i>I will change this corrupt world</i>
<i>into a new one...</i>

45:51.090 --> 45:53.960
<i>ruled by benevolence.</i>

45:59.740 --> 46:01.360
Crap! It's closed!

46:02.740 --> 46:03.900
This is the police!

46:04.140 --> 46:05.130
Open up!

46:06.810 --> 46:07.830
Idiot!

46:22.860 --> 46:25.120
<i>- We interrupt scheduled programming...</i>
- Hello?

46:25.190 --> 46:27.560
<i>- to go live to the front of Sakura TV.</i>
- Crap! I'm not getting through!

46:27.700 --> 46:28.820
M-Mr. Aizawa!

46:35.410 --> 46:37.770
<i>Take a look!</i>
<i>Someone has collapsed here!</i>

46:38.340 --> 46:41.210
<i>- This is at the entrance of Sakura TV!</i>
- M-Mr. Ukita!

46:41.510 --> 46:42.640
Mr. Aizawa.

46:43.850 --> 46:45.340
Where do you think you're going?

46:45.780 --> 46:47.770
Where Ukita is, of course!

46:47.950 --> 46:50.940
That wouldn't be good.
Please think about this calmly.

46:51.090 --> 46:53.890
I thought that Kira couldn't kill
unless he had a name!

46:54.120 --> 46:57.650
Has Kira discovered that
our names are aliases?!

46:58.090 --> 46:59.860
That may be so.

47:01.430 --> 47:04.700
I deduced that he needed a face
and a name to kill.

47:04.870 --> 47:06.770
But from what I can see,

47:06.840 --> 47:10.770
it's not entirely impossible that
he may only need a face to kill...

47:12.380 --> 47:15.830
All I can say is that Kira is
within that TV station building,

47:15.910 --> 47:19.850
or is in a place where he can watch
who enters the building.

47:19.920 --> 47:23.510
If Kira is in the area, isn't that
more of a reason to go?!

47:23.650 --> 47:26.950
He may have only placed
surveillance cameras in the area.

47:29.460 --> 47:30.290
R-Ryuzaki!

47:50.650 --> 47:52.510
What in the world is this?!

47:54.920 --> 47:57.850
Where is the studio where
they're airing the Kira video?!

47:58.290 --> 47:59.480
<i>There's been a crash!</i>

47:59.560 --> 48:02.050
<i>A vehicle has just crashed into</i>
<i>the Sakura TV studio!</i>

48:03.290 --> 48:06.460
That's one way to get into
the building without being seen.

48:06.730 --> 48:08.320
But who would...?

48:09.430 --> 48:11.830
This is the police!
Stop this program!

48:12.300 --> 48:13.500
Wh-What's this?!

48:13.900 --> 48:15.870
Stop the Kira tape immediately!

48:15.940 --> 48:18.410
W-Wait a second, detective!

48:18.710 --> 48:21.700
If you stop this, Kira will kill us...

48:22.810 --> 48:23.940
Bring them out!

48:24.280 --> 48:27.110
If you give them to me now,
you won't be killed!

48:30.790 --> 48:32.590
It's from Bureau Chief Yagami.

48:32.890 --> 48:34.950
Call him back
and give the phone to me.

48:35.660 --> 48:37.520
Quickly, get me Ryuzaki!

48:37.790 --> 48:38.780
It's me.

48:39.060 --> 48:42.160
So that was you
in the patrol wagon, Mr. Yagami.

48:42.370 --> 48:45.030
Yes... I just couldn't take it anymore...

48:45.600 --> 48:49.040
I've confiscated all the tapes.
I'll bring them to you.

49:00.520 --> 49:03.010
God is truly on my side...

49:03.590 --> 49:06.450
But this time, instead of God,
it's a Shinigami.

49:07.690 --> 49:09.020
So it seems.

49:10.060 --> 49:12.720
He probably has the Shinigami eyes...

49:13.560 --> 49:17.630
In other words,
he's a far deadlier Kira than I am...

49:18.370 --> 49:19.700
A second Kira!

49:20.370 --> 49:22.400
Yes. There is a high possibility

49:22.470 --> 49:24.740
that this Kira is pretending
to be Kira.

49:24.970 --> 49:28.210
In other words, we should refer
to him as "Second Kira."

49:28.710 --> 49:30.680
If the impostor slips up and gets caught,

49:30.750 --> 49:33.270
the police might find out about
the Death Note. That would be disastrous.

49:33.980 --> 49:36.450
I can't leave him alone
for too long.

49:39.290 --> 49:42.660
What I need to do
most now is...

49:42.730 --> 49:44.820
to cooperate with the investigation...

49:44.890 --> 49:48.260
and to figure out L's moves
and the fake Kira's moves...

49:49.570 --> 49:50.830
Mr. Yagami.

49:51.200 --> 49:54.860
May I ask your son to help us
with this investigation?

49:56.170 --> 50:00.370
Does that mean
he's no longer a suspect?

50:00.840 --> 50:03.040
If we catch one Kira...

50:03.110 --> 50:08.110
I think we'll get a hint as to
how we can catch the other.

50:14.890 --> 50:16.120
Say, Misa.

50:16.660 --> 50:19.030
I gave you the Death Note...

50:19.260 --> 50:22.660
so why don't you use it
for yourself more often?

50:23.100 --> 50:24.970
I am using it for myself.

50:25.200 --> 50:27.300
I believe in what Kira is doing.

50:27.770 --> 50:29.830
I want to know what kind
of person Kira is.

50:30.610 --> 50:32.800
I want to get to know him
in person.

50:33.710 --> 50:35.680
That's a really dangerous game
you're playing.

50:35.980 --> 50:39.240
You might be killed.
Do you understand that?

50:39.720 --> 50:41.380
It's all right.

50:41.450 --> 50:44.250
I'm sure that Kira is kind
to those with pure hearts.

50:44.550 --> 50:45.920
Just in case something happens...

50:45.990 --> 50:49.150
I'm stronger because
I have the eyes!

50:58.400 --> 51:00.960
My father told me
to come here...

51:01.140 --> 51:02.400
Am I early?

51:08.810 --> 51:10.040
An unknown caller?

51:12.020 --> 51:12.850
Yes?

51:13.080 --> 51:14.710
<i>Are you Light Yagami?</i>

51:15.390 --> 51:16.410
That would be me.

51:17.290 --> 51:18.220
<i>This is L.</i>

51:20.360 --> 51:23.380
<i>Today, I would like to discuss</i>
<i>the Kira incident.</i>

51:23.460 --> 51:25.830
<i>I had your father ask you</i>
<i>to come here.</i>

51:26.800 --> 51:29.160
<i>I'm sorry for doing this</i>
<i>at such a busy time.</i>

51:29.800 --> 51:30.860
It's all right.

51:31.300 --> 51:32.790
<i>I shall lead you to me.</i>

52:56.950 --> 53:00.580
I'm L. Thank you for coming today.

53:01.120 --> 53:02.590
It's all right, L.

53:02.660 --> 53:06.650
I've respected your abilities
for quite some time now.

53:08.800 --> 53:11.960
I see. I'm honored.

53:14.640 --> 53:16.940
Refer to me as Ryuzaki
while you're here.

53:17.170 --> 53:21.610
On to business.
I want you to watch a video.

53:21.940 --> 53:23.110
Please have a seat.

53:23.610 --> 53:24.980
All right, Ryuzaki.

53:29.050 --> 53:30.250
Now then...

53:37.260 --> 53:38.520
It isn't starting.

53:38.660 --> 53:40.460
Oh, I forgot.

53:41.000 --> 53:42.760
Please begin.

53:47.900 --> 53:49.840
This was that tape that was aired...

53:49.910 --> 53:51.970
No. It's a different one.

53:52.710 --> 53:56.410
We believe that this Kira
is a different Kira.

53:56.480 --> 53:58.610
Just the other day, we posed as
the real Kira

53:58.680 --> 54:00.170
and released a message
to the impostor.

54:00.950 --> 54:02.820
<i>I am the real Kira.</i>

54:02.890 --> 54:04.950
<i>To the person</i>
<i>who has used my name:</i>

54:05.020 --> 54:09.320
<i>I shall punish you if you continue</i>
<i>to cause trouble.</i>

54:11.090 --> 54:12.320
Did you see this one?

54:12.730 --> 54:16.360
Yes. So it was a video
made by the police.

54:17.030 --> 54:19.760
This is the response to our message.

54:20.200 --> 54:22.040
It's a bit incomprehensible...

54:23.470 --> 54:26.310
<i>Kira, thank you for</i>
<i>your response.</i>

54:26.740 --> 54:31.610
<i>I shall do as you say.</i>
<i>I want to see you.</i>

54:31.910 --> 54:35.720
<i>What's this?</i>
<i>What is he thinking-?</i>

54:36.220 --> 54:38.590
<i>I don't think you have the eyes...</i>

54:39.090 --> 54:43.150
<i>But I won't kill you. Don't worry.</i>

54:43.990 --> 54:48.060
<i>Is he stupid?!</i>
<i>He talked about the Shinigami Eyes...</i>

54:52.470 --> 54:56.800
<i>- Let me know how we can meet.</i>
<i>- No, don't panic.</i>

54:57.170 --> 54:59.540
<i>When we do,</i>
<i>we can confirm our identities</i>

54:59.610 --> 55:01.600
<i>by showing our Shinigami</i>
<i>to each other.</i>

55:01.940 --> 55:03.570
<i>It's no good.</i>

55:04.310 --> 55:06.040
<i>I have to do something</i>
<i>about him quickly...</i>

55:23.100 --> 55:24.090
What do you think?

55:25.000 --> 55:26.440
I'm surprised...

55:26.500 --> 55:29.770
This Kira seems to care more
about meeting Kira

55:29.840 --> 55:32.000
than about Kira's ideals...

55:32.910 --> 55:36.280
And more importantly,
that word, "Shinigami."

55:36.880 --> 55:37.870
Yes...

55:50.930 --> 55:52.400
That's good...

55:53.200 --> 55:55.170
Yeah, like that!

55:55.460 --> 55:56.400
That was great...

55:56.470 --> 55:57.930
Just great, Misa.

55:58.030 --> 55:59.260
It was wonderful!

56:01.870 --> 56:03.640
I'm worn out...

56:03.970 --> 56:07.100
Modeling sure uses
a lot of energy!

56:08.340 --> 56:09.510
Say, Rem...

56:09.610 --> 56:10.380
Hmm?

56:10.880 --> 56:12.180
Can I ask you something?

56:12.450 --> 56:13.250
What is it?

56:13.950 --> 56:16.920
Shinigami must each
have a Death Note.

56:17.290 --> 56:19.410
To have a human obtain
and play with a Death Note

56:19.490 --> 56:21.220
requires a Shinigami to
have two Death Notes...

56:21.560 --> 56:25.190
That means that Ryuk, the Shinigami
who gave the Death Note to Kira,

56:25.260 --> 56:27.820
tricked the Shinigami lord into
giving him two notebooks, right?

56:28.460 --> 56:29.330
That's right.

56:29.730 --> 56:31.060
Does that mean you did that, too?

56:31.300 --> 56:35.640
No. The Shinigami lord
is not that easily fooled.

56:36.240 --> 56:37.800
Then how?

56:38.710 --> 56:41.870
I am one of only a few
in the Shinigami World...

56:42.040 --> 56:44.010
Let's just say...

56:44.080 --> 56:48.280
that I know how to kill
a Shinigami.

56:54.990 --> 56:57.320
There once was a Shinigami
named Gelus

56:57.390 --> 57:01.330
who used to watch a certain girl
from the Shinigami World...

57:23.050 --> 57:25.250
<i>I love you more than</i>
<i>anyone else in the world!</i>

57:25.320 --> 57:27.190
<i>I'm always watching you!</i>
<i>I want to protect you!</i>

57:31.730 --> 57:33.750
<i>H-Hey. Stop!</i>

57:37.130 --> 57:41.230
Gelus did something that
a Shinigami should not do.

57:51.550 --> 57:56.510
Gelus used his Death Note
to save the girl.

57:57.850 --> 57:59.410
But that was not good...

58:01.390 --> 58:05.050
Shinigami shorten humans lives...

58:05.290 --> 58:08.090
They only exist to take them...

58:14.270 --> 58:15.860
At that moment,

58:15.940 --> 58:21.240
Gelus became something which
was neither sand nor rust, and died.

58:23.510 --> 58:26.280
Only his Death Note was left.

58:32.790 --> 58:35.120
Does that mean that
the Shinigami wouldn't have died

58:35.190 --> 58:37.390
if he hadn't fallen in love with that girl?

58:37.930 --> 58:39.050
That's right.

58:42.370 --> 58:43.990
Then...

58:45.170 --> 58:49.470
the Shinigami named Gelus
was the one who saved me...

58:54.510 --> 58:57.950
I see. In order to kill a Shinigami,

58:58.010 --> 59:00.880
you need him to fall in love with a human
and have him save that person.

59:01.920 --> 59:05.750
Now I have something
I can tell Kira.

59:06.320 --> 59:12.320
I wonder if he knows...
how to kill a Shinigami?

59:44.730 --> 59:46.530
P-Pleased to meet you...

59:46.900 --> 59:48.130
I'm Misa Amane.

59:48.860 --> 59:52.060
I thought you might be worried
if you were watching TV...

59:52.130 --> 59:54.100
I just couldn't take it any more.

59:54.540 --> 59:56.200
Take this notebook...

59:57.270 --> 59:58.430
<i>A Death Note...</i>

01:00:05.850 --> 01:00:07.180
<i>A Shinigami!</i>

01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:09.350
<i>It's Fake Kira...</i>

01:00:10.550 --> 01:00:11.610
Have a seat.

01:00:12.690 --> 01:00:14.280
Th-Thank you.

01:00:25.330 --> 01:00:26.830
How did you find me?

01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:28.800
Oh... I thought so.

01:00:28.870 --> 01:00:30.860
You haven't made the eye bargain.

01:00:32.310 --> 01:00:34.070
When you have the Shinigami eyes,

01:00:34.140 --> 01:00:37.050
you can see
a person's lifespan and age.

01:00:37.450 --> 01:00:39.680
But you cannot see the lifespan
of someone

01:00:39.750 --> 01:00:41.610
who has a Death Note.

01:00:43.490 --> 01:00:44.820
<i>Found you.</i>

01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:51.760
<i>Yagami... Tsuki, is it?</i>

01:00:52.260 --> 01:00:54.250
<i>He's the only one whose lifespan</i>
<i>I can't see.</i>

01:00:54.660 --> 01:00:56.330
Light Yagami
<i>He's Kira!</i>

01:00:56.930 --> 01:01:00.060
<i>I didn't think it would be</i>
<i>so easy to find him.</i>

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:03.800
Well, I understand that, but...

01:01:04.140 --> 01:01:06.630
What would happen
if you were caught by the police

01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:08.870
and Kira's secret was discovered?

01:01:09.450 --> 01:01:10.540
It's all right...

01:01:10.610 --> 01:01:13.740
I wasn't caught and if
I continue to do as you say,

01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:15.550
I won't be.

01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:17.020
Right?

01:01:17.650 --> 01:01:19.880
And I can see L's name...

01:01:20.660 --> 01:01:22.390
I will be your eyes...

01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:24.780
So...

01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:28.260
So?

01:01:29.470 --> 01:01:31.090
Make me your girlfriend!

01:01:33.140 --> 01:01:34.260
Girlfriend?!

01:01:35.140 --> 01:01:35.900
Yes...

01:01:37.970 --> 01:01:41.270
<i>If I treat her badly,</i>
<i>she might kill me...</i>

01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:42.870
<i>But...</i>

01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:44.610
It's impossible.

01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:47.640
The tapes you sent to
the television station

01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:49.810
all had the same fingerprints
on them.

01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:51.990
Those aren't my fingerprints.

01:01:52.050 --> 01:01:55.050
I, at least, think before doing things.

01:01:57.090 --> 01:01:58.530
If you really don't believe me...

01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:02.860
you can hold on to
my Death Note.

01:02:04.730 --> 01:02:07.230
Now I can't kill you.

01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:11.100
And you can kill me once
I'm of no use to you.

01:02:11.740 --> 01:02:13.770
<i>Why is she going this far?</i>

01:02:14.940 --> 01:02:17.640
But you might have removed
several pages from the Death Note

01:02:17.710 --> 01:02:19.880
and hid them somewhere.

01:02:21.050 --> 01:02:22.920
Why are you so suspicious?!

01:02:23.620 --> 01:02:26.650
I'm perfectly happy to be used by you!

01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:28.250
Believe me!

01:02:29.390 --> 01:02:31.220
How can you go so far
as to say that?

01:02:33.630 --> 01:02:35.260
About a year ago,

01:02:35.330 --> 01:02:39.790
a burglar killed my parents
right in front of me.

01:02:40.670 --> 01:02:42.540
I couldn't forgive him...

01:02:43.610 --> 01:02:45.440
But the trial dragged along

01:02:45.510 --> 01:02:47.840
and he was even looking
at an acquittal...

01:02:48.810 --> 01:02:52.710
That's when Kira punished him.

01:02:53.820 --> 01:02:56.950
Kira means everything to me.

01:02:59.220 --> 01:03:03.560
I just... I just wanted to
meet you so badly...

01:03:04.030 --> 01:03:05.650
I wanted to thank you...

01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:33.320
All right...

01:03:33.490 --> 01:03:36.720
I can't be your boyfriend,
but I can act as if I am.

01:03:37.330 --> 01:03:41.660
Those eyes for which
you gave up half of your life

01:03:41.730 --> 01:03:44.830
will serve me as a weapon.

01:03:46.370 --> 01:03:50.770
Thank you...
I'll try to make you love me.

01:04:11.330 --> 01:04:12.760
That's not true.

01:04:12.900 --> 01:04:14.830
I just have a knack for
getting things done.

01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:27.840
Oh! Yagami.

01:04:28.780 --> 01:04:29.840
Hello.

01:04:34.190 --> 01:04:35.750
What's wrong, Ryuzaki?

01:04:36.020 --> 01:04:38.220
Is it all right for you
to come out here?

01:04:38.660 --> 01:04:41.420
I'm all right as long as
you're not Kira.

01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:44.990
I forgot to tell you

01:04:45.060 --> 01:04:48.590
that I still think that
you might be Kira.

01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:52.200
Well, even so, there's only
a five-percent chance that you <i>are</i> him...

01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:54.870
And you're the only person
outside now

01:04:54.940 --> 01:04:57.430
who knows that I'm L...

01:04:58.110 --> 01:05:00.770
I've told everyone on
the investigative team...

01:05:00.850 --> 01:05:04.480
that if I die soon, you're Kira.

01:05:12.830 --> 01:05:17.820
<i>He weakened my resolve</i>
<i>as soon as I was going to kill him...</i>

01:05:18.730 --> 01:05:21.130
<i>This is exactly what he wants...</i>

01:05:22.140 --> 01:05:24.130
Light, there you are!

01:05:25.300 --> 01:05:28.040
I came because
we were filming nearby.

01:05:28.110 --> 01:05:30.010
<i>Misa! You idiot...</i>

01:05:30.410 --> 01:05:33.850
Is this a friend of yours?
He's wonderfully individualistic...

01:05:35.210 --> 01:05:37.010
<i>No! I've won!</i>

01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:40.180
Misa can see Ryuzaki's real name!

01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:44.220
I'm Light's girlfriend, Misa Amane.
Pleased to meet you.

01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:45.990
I'm Hideki Ryuga.

01:05:46.260 --> 01:05:48.420
Huh? Hideki Ryuga?

01:05:49.230 --> 01:05:52.630
Yeah. He has the same first name
and last name as that pop idol.

01:05:52.900 --> 01:05:54.030
Isn't that amusing?

01:05:54.700 --> 01:05:57.360
<i>But that's not the name I see...</i>

01:05:57.940 --> 01:06:02.070
<i>Ryuzaki, coming out here</i>
<i>has backfired on you!</i>

01:06:06.980 --> 01:06:08.380
<i>Why is he laughing?</i>

01:06:09.050 --> 01:06:11.180
<i>Does this mean he noticed?</i>

01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:14.720
<i>But if he's guessed that</i>
<i>she's the Second Kira,</i>

01:06:14.790 --> 01:06:16.620
<i>there's no way</i>
<i>he would be laughing...</i>

01:06:18.090 --> 01:06:19.350
Yagami...

01:06:21.460 --> 01:06:22.930
I'm jealous.

01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:26.230
You're Misa, the pop idol
from the October edition of Eighteen.

01:06:26.300 --> 01:06:27.320
I'm a fan.

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:29.930
What? Really? I'm so happy!

01:06:30.140 --> 01:06:32.230
Hey, that girl.
Isn't she Misa-Misa?!

01:06:32.410 --> 01:06:34.530
It's true. It's Misa-Misa!

01:06:34.610 --> 01:06:36.130
- What? Misa-Misa?
- The real one?!

01:06:36.210 --> 01:06:38.340
I should've known I'd be recognized
where there are lots of young people.

01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:40.080
I watch you every month.

01:06:40.310 --> 01:06:41.680
Keep up the good work.

01:06:42.010 --> 01:06:43.920
Yeah. Thank you.
I'll give it my best...

01:06:44.050 --> 01:06:45.380
<i>What's going on?</i>

01:06:45.450 --> 01:06:46.420
Misa!

01:06:47.290 --> 01:06:49.720
It's already time!
Do you want to be late again?!

01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:51.690
Oh, sorry, Yoshi.

01:06:51.860 --> 01:06:52.620
Let's go!

01:06:52.690 --> 01:06:53.680
Oh, okay.

01:06:54.990 --> 01:06:58.090
<i>That's good...</i>
<i>Once Misa's out of here,</i>

01:06:58.160 --> 01:07:00.830
<i>I just have to give her a call</i>
<i>and ask her for L's name.</i>

01:07:01.370 --> 01:07:04.700
See you after work, Light...

01:07:09.780 --> 01:07:11.840
Now then, shall we go, Yagami?

01:07:12.250 --> 01:07:13.240
Well...

01:07:13.310 --> 01:07:16.840
I have a lecture soon.
Could we talk later?

01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:20.010
I see. Well then, see you later...

01:07:32.630 --> 01:07:33.660
<i>It's over...</i>

01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:38.040
<i>It's been fun...L.</i>

01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:53.880
Yes?

01:07:55.490 --> 01:07:59.950
Yes. I see. We did it.
All right.

01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:06.260
The news I have to tell you
is both good and bad...

01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:08.200
We've taken Misa Amane
into custody

01:08:08.270 --> 01:08:10.130
under suspicion of
being the Second Kira.

01:08:12.710 --> 01:08:14.770
<i>How long has he known</i>
<i>about Misa?</i>

01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:18.979
There were hairs and fabric threads,
among other things...

01:08:19.050 --> 01:08:23.640
on the masking tape used to wrap
the tapes sent by the Second Kira

01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:26.050
which matched samples
from her room.

01:08:27.490 --> 01:08:29.220
There will probably be a riot

01:08:29.290 --> 01:08:31.380
if we accuse her of
being the Second Kira.

01:08:31.590 --> 01:08:33.359
So we're saying that her manager
surrendered voluntarily

01:08:33.430 --> 01:08:35.090
on charges of drug possession.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.020
The truth will probably
never become public.

01:08:46.370 --> 01:08:47.840
R-Ryuzaki!

01:08:48.140 --> 01:08:49.340
What is this?!

01:08:49.939 --> 01:08:52.240
I've apprehended her
as the Second Kira.

01:08:52.310 --> 01:08:54.109
It's necessary, at the very least.

01:08:55.310 --> 01:08:56.300
Also, Mr. Yagami...

01:08:57.580 --> 01:09:01.950
I'm probably going to have
to bring in Light to testify as Kira.

01:09:02.189 --> 01:09:03.420
Please be prepared.

01:09:11.830 --> 01:09:13.270
Oh, Rem.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.660
Light Yagami...

01:09:16.100 --> 01:09:19.660
Misa forfeited her ownership
of the Death Note.

01:09:21.010 --> 01:09:24.810
All of her memories concerning
the notebook have been erased.

01:09:25.340 --> 01:09:28.510
She no longer can reveal
your secret...

01:09:30.620 --> 01:09:34.490
Misa even refused my offer
to help her escape.

01:09:35.420 --> 01:09:39.090
She probably figured that
she would be causing you trouble

01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:42.600
if they thought she
had special powers...

01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:47.430
She did it because she wants
you to love her.

01:09:48.569 --> 01:09:50.040
Light Yagami...

01:09:50.970 --> 01:09:54.810
I'll kill you if you don't save Misa.

01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:35.150
<i>It's been a week</i>

01:10:35.210 --> 01:10:37.510
<i>since we've detained Amane</i>
<i>and Light Yagami...</i>

01:10:38.150 --> 01:10:41.120
<i>Kira has completely</i>
<i>stopped killing criminals...</i>

01:10:42.250 --> 01:10:44.490
<i>We're pretty sure that</i>
<i>they're Kira...</i>

01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:49.460
<i>But why did Light accept</i>
<i>his detention so peacefully?</i>

01:10:50.030 --> 01:10:51.860
<i>Even if he were Kira,</i>

01:10:51.930 --> 01:10:56.130
<i>did he think he could act</i>
<i>as if he knew nothing?</i>

01:10:57.540 --> 01:10:59.470
<i>It's not like Light Yagami...</i>

01:10:59.540 --> 01:11:02.030
<i>No, it's not like Kira.</i>

01:11:11.750 --> 01:11:12.810
<i>Light...</i>

01:11:13.290 --> 01:11:14.650
<i>It's been just one week...</i>

01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:16.350
<i>But I'm pretty sure</i>
<i>you're worn out...</i>

01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:18.090
Are you all right?

01:11:20.630 --> 01:11:24.190
<i>Now that I've come this far,</i>
<i>I think it's about time...</i>

01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:33.460
<i>Yeah. I don't think I look</i>
<i>very cool in this situation...</i>

01:11:33.540 --> 01:11:35.940
<i>But I'm going to discard...</i>

01:11:37.410 --> 01:11:38.780
Such worthless pride.

01:11:53.690 --> 01:11:54.920
Got it.

01:11:58.630 --> 01:11:59.720
See you later.

01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:15.770
<i>Why am I doing this?</i>

01:12:16.980 --> 01:12:18.010
<i>Ryuzaki...</i>

01:12:18.450 --> 01:12:20.980
<i>I did indeed agree to be detained</i>

01:12:21.050 --> 01:12:22.610
<i>and chose to do this...</i>

01:12:23.290 --> 01:12:27.320
<i>But I just realized that</i>
<i>doing this is meaningless!</i>

01:12:28.230 --> 01:12:30.160
<i>Why? Because I'm not Kira!</i>

01:12:30.230 --> 01:12:32.030
Get me out of here quickly!

01:12:32.770 --> 01:12:35.030
<i>What's wrong, Light Yagami?</i>

01:12:35.100 --> 01:12:37.230
<i>What you're saying is crazy...</i>

01:12:37.300 --> 01:12:40.430
<i>But...for some reason it feels</i>
<i>like it's the truth.</i>

01:12:41.010 --> 01:12:43.640
Let me out of here quickly.
This is a waste of time.

01:12:43.710 --> 01:12:46.080
<i>No. I can't let you out.</i>

01:12:46.510 --> 01:12:47.910
You're wrong.

01:12:48.380 --> 01:12:50.080
I can understand why
you deduced

01:12:50.150 --> 01:12:53.450
from the investigative situation
that I'm Kira, but it's a trap!

01:12:54.090 --> 01:12:55.420
<i>I'm not Kira!</i>

01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:58.820
Zoom in or something and
look at my eyes!

01:12:59.290 --> 01:13:01.950
Are these the eyes of
someone who is lying?

01:13:06.470 --> 01:13:07.800
<i>Misa Amane...</i>

01:13:08.570 --> 01:13:10.090
Mr. Stalker, what is it?

01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:11.940
Are you planning to let me go?

01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:15.370
Do you know why
you're being detained here?

01:13:15.610 --> 01:13:18.340
Why? Is it because
I'm a pop idol?

01:13:19.010 --> 01:13:23.010
But you're the first stalker
who's gone this far.

01:13:23.450 --> 01:13:25.920
<i>So you really don't know</i>
<i>who Kira is?</i>

01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:27.250
<i>Huh?</i>

01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:30.150
<i>This again?</i>
<i>That's what I want to know.</i>

01:13:30.220 --> 01:13:32.160
Wh-What's going on?

01:13:32.290 --> 01:13:35.020
Since yesterday, criminals are
suddenly dying again

01:13:35.090 --> 01:13:36.960
after more than two weeks
of nothing.

01:13:37.100 --> 01:13:38.030
Yeah.

01:13:38.100 --> 01:13:39.330
Kira Returns
It's the return of Kira.

01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:48.100
<i>I don't know what's going on...</i>

01:13:56.650 --> 01:13:59.710
Isn't it great that Light and Misa-Misa
can return to their normal lives?

01:13:59.780 --> 01:14:02.050
They're still under surveillance, though.

01:14:02.380 --> 01:14:05.180
Matsuda, stop calling
her Misa-Misa.

01:14:06.020 --> 01:14:09.860
Say... This doesn't really
feel like a date.

01:14:10.290 --> 01:14:13.060
Even though I asked you to help
with the investigation,

01:14:13.130 --> 01:14:15.430
you and Light are still suspects.

01:14:15.730 --> 01:14:17.220
Please put up with this.

01:14:17.700 --> 01:14:20.190
Anyway, you don't seem
very enthusiastic

01:14:20.270 --> 01:14:24.800
despite the fact that we're helping
with the investigation.

01:14:25.710 --> 01:14:27.140
Enthusiasm?

01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:31.640
I have none...
Actually, I'm depressed.

01:14:32.110 --> 01:14:33.310
You're depressed?

01:14:33.820 --> 01:14:34.610
Yes.

01:14:36.020 --> 01:14:40.510
All this time,
I had thought that you were Kira.

01:14:41.260 --> 01:14:44.230
I'm shocked that my deduction
was off...

01:14:47.100 --> 01:14:48.220
Ryuzaki...

01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:49.530
What?!

01:15:03.180 --> 01:15:04.610
That hurt.

01:15:05.110 --> 01:15:08.020
Stop messing around.
I wasn't Kira...

01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:09.680
so you don't feel like
doing anything

01:15:09.750 --> 01:15:11.190
because your deduction
was wrong?

01:15:12.690 --> 01:15:14.880
I may have phrased that incorrectly.

01:15:15.690 --> 01:15:17.350
It would be a waste for us
to make a move,

01:15:17.430 --> 01:15:18.360
so we shouldn't...

01:15:18.530 --> 01:15:20.120
There's no way
we can catch him

01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:21.390
if we don't chase him!

01:15:22.030 --> 01:15:23.560
Do you know how
many innocent people

01:15:23.630 --> 01:15:25.070
you've involved in this case?!

01:15:25.870 --> 01:15:28.770
Besides that, you're the one
that detained Misa and me!

01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:35.040
I know...
But whatever your reasons...

01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:40.410
It's an eye for an eye.

01:15:42.780 --> 01:15:43.950
Oh?!

01:15:55.530 --> 01:15:59.020
It's not that my deduction was wrong,
but the case isn't solved with

01:15:59.100 --> 01:16:03.090
Light equals Kira and
Misa Amane equals Second Kira.

01:16:03.940 --> 01:16:05.700
So I was a bit depressed.

01:16:06.370 --> 01:16:08.400
Is it wrong for someone
to feel like that?

01:16:08.910 --> 01:16:11.880
That's no good.
The way you talk...

01:16:11.950 --> 01:16:15.380
It's as if you want me
to be Kira.

01:16:16.350 --> 01:16:18.750
I want you to be Kira?

01:16:19.790 --> 01:16:21.810
That may be true...

01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:28.190
I just noticed...now...
I wanted you to be Kira...

01:16:32.730 --> 01:16:38.730
It's an eye...for an eye.
I'm pretty strong.

01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:43.670
L-Let's call the room
and stop them!

01:16:46.750 --> 01:16:48.910
<i>- Yes?</i>
- Ryuzaki, listen to this.

01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:52.920
Misa-Misa became number one
in Eighteen's reader popularity poll!

01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:55.050
<i>Yes, I see...</i>

01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:59.230
That means that she's the heroine
in the next Nishinaka film!

01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:01.450
What's wrong?

01:17:01.660 --> 01:17:03.630
Matsuda's acting stupid again.

01:17:04.470 --> 01:17:06.900
<i>Well, Matsuda is a natural at that.</i>

01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:08.970
I can hear you...

01:17:16.610 --> 01:17:19.270
Ryuzaki, I'm sorry
you don't feel like doing anything,

01:17:19.350 --> 01:17:20.650
but come over here for a second.

01:17:21.380 --> 01:17:22.910
Take a good look at this.

01:17:23.620 --> 01:17:24.710
Don't you think this is peculiar?

01:17:25.950 --> 01:17:30.320
All three of them were
prominent Japanese businessmen.

01:17:31.460 --> 01:17:33.720
They all died of heart attacks.

01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:35.660
As a result,

01:17:35.730 --> 01:17:38.760
Yotsuba's stock prices rose
and those of other companies dropped.

01:17:39.730 --> 01:17:42.930
In other words, they're deaths
which are in Yotsuba's favor...

01:17:43.140 --> 01:17:44.330
What do you think?

01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:48.200
I don't think that Kira is
supporting Yotsuba, but...

01:17:53.980 --> 01:17:55.750
It seems we're all here.

01:17:56.020 --> 01:17:58.040
Then let's begin our regular meeting.

01:17:58.520 --> 01:18:01.680
To further the growth of
the Yotsuba Group...

01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:04.490
to become the biggest business
in the world...

01:18:05.330 --> 01:18:06.890
Who should we kill?

01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:19.370
<i>Ryuzaki.</i>

01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:20.700
What is it, Watari?

01:18:21.210 --> 01:18:25.810
Detective Eraldo Coil has received
a request to reveal L's identity.

01:18:27.450 --> 01:18:28.920
Wasn't Eraldo Coil...

01:18:28.980 --> 01:18:31.890
the man who's the
next greatest detective after L?

01:18:32.550 --> 01:18:34.610
Who in the world would send
such a request?

01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:38.620
The person who sent
in the request is...

01:18:38.690 --> 01:18:40.060
Masahiko Kida, the head of

01:18:40.130 --> 01:18:42.460
Yotsuba Group's Planning Department
in their Tokyo headquarters.

01:18:42.630 --> 01:18:44.330
So it was Yotsuba!

01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:47.100
That's not good.
We're short-handed.

01:18:47.170 --> 01:18:50.000
We need to pay attention
to Coil, too?

01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:56.080
It's all right. The detective known
as Eraldo Coil is me.

01:18:57.550 --> 01:19:02.640
The world's three greatest detectives,
L, Coil, and Danuve...

01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:04.080
are all me.

01:19:04.590 --> 01:19:07.490
I'll give you this strawberry,
so keep it a secret.

01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:10.750
You're really something, Ryuzaki.

01:19:34.580 --> 01:19:36.810
Just watch me. Even I can be useful...

01:19:45.990 --> 01:19:48.900
Okay. I just have to get close
to him, right?

01:19:49.330 --> 01:19:50.420
Leave it to me.

01:19:50.870 --> 01:19:52.530
And I just have to break

01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:55.330
the surveillance cameras
and defense system...

01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:59.170
of Yotsuba's Tokyo headquarters,
where this guy is.

01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:00.770
Yes.

01:20:00.840 --> 01:20:04.900
It is safe to assume that Kira and
Yotsuba are connected.

01:20:05.480 --> 01:20:07.110
We're going to check Yotsuba

01:20:07.180 --> 01:20:09.710
to see how many people
have special powers.

01:20:09.780 --> 01:20:13.220
It is important that we have
a clear understanding.

01:20:15.320 --> 01:20:17.790
<i>Crap. I can't hear them clearly.</i>

01:20:18.260 --> 01:20:21.460
<i>I've got to pick up something important...</i>

01:20:25.730 --> 01:20:27.290
He's just in the way.

01:20:27.370 --> 01:20:29.000
Let's kill him and split up his stocks.

01:20:29.070 --> 01:20:30.700
<i>I just heard them say, "kill"!</i>

01:20:32.670 --> 01:20:34.540
Kira sure is varied.

01:20:34.610 --> 01:20:35.410
<i>Kira?!</i>

01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:37.910
<i>There it is! Kira!</i>
<i>There it is! What?!</i>

01:20:37.980 --> 01:20:40.850
<i>"Let's have Kira kill him"?!</i>
<i>I heard it!</i>

01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:43.080
<i>They're really working with Kira...</i>

01:20:43.150 --> 01:20:45.450
<i>I did it...I did a great job!</i>

01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:55.660
Who are you?!

01:20:57.730 --> 01:21:01.070
If at all possible, do not do
anything hasty or impulsive.

01:21:01.140 --> 01:21:03.430
Don't make any decisions
by yourself.

01:21:04.510 --> 01:21:05.300
<i>Ryuzaki...</i>

01:21:05.740 --> 01:21:06.830
What is it, Watari?

01:21:07.480 --> 01:21:09.340
<i>Mr. Matsuda has sent</i>
<i>an emergency signal</i>

01:21:09.410 --> 01:21:10.880
<i>from his belt.</i>

01:21:12.050 --> 01:21:13.140
Where's it coming from?

01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:14.710
Well, it seems...

01:21:14.780 --> 01:21:17.880
it's coming from within
Yotsuba's Tokyo headquarters.

01:21:18.690 --> 01:21:20.680
My name is Taro Matsui.

01:21:20.760 --> 01:21:24.090
I'm a manager with
Yoshida Productions!

01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:27.390
How would you like to use
our top multi-talented star, Misa Amane?

01:21:27.460 --> 01:21:31.730
As the face of your company
and for your commercials?!

01:21:33.370 --> 01:21:34.860
Matsuda, you idiot...

01:21:44.110 --> 01:21:46.840
Light! Are you allowed to
go out with me today?

01:21:46.920 --> 01:21:48.510
Along with Ryuzaki...

01:21:49.250 --> 01:21:50.120
Misa...

01:21:51.090 --> 01:21:53.180
Do you love Light?

01:21:53.760 --> 01:21:54.690
Yes...

01:21:54.760 --> 01:21:55.550
So...

01:21:55.620 --> 01:21:58.180
Who would you pick, Light or Kira?

01:21:58.330 --> 01:21:59.320
Huh?

01:21:59.590 --> 01:22:01.720
Light, of course.

01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:03.960
So would you want to be
of help to Light

01:22:04.030 --> 01:22:07.370
and work with him
on the investigation?

01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:08.400
R-Ryuzaki!

01:22:08.470 --> 01:22:12.170
Yeah! I'll do anything for
Light's sake!

01:22:12.340 --> 01:22:14.610
W-Wait a second.
What are you doing?

01:22:15.510 --> 01:22:18.140
Right now, Matsuda has
been captured by Yotsuba.

01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:21.020
Let's make use of the situation.

01:22:21.950 --> 01:22:27.180
Misa will go to Yotsuba and
try to advertise herself.

01:22:27.860 --> 01:22:30.950
We will get information
about Yotsuba from Misa.

01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:32.850
She'll be our spy.

01:22:33.060 --> 01:22:34.360
Yeah.

01:22:34.530 --> 01:22:35.590
That's not good.

01:22:35.730 --> 01:22:36.600
Why?

01:22:36.660 --> 01:22:39.360
Because you'll be put in danger.

01:22:40.500 --> 01:22:42.440
Are you worried about me?

01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:43.630
Light.

01:22:45.110 --> 01:22:49.340
If we win, Misa won't die. And...

01:22:49.410 --> 01:22:53.070
as long as we're handcuffed,
we share the same fate.

01:22:54.520 --> 01:22:55.880
Back to business...

01:22:55.950 --> 01:22:57.940
Let's have Matsuda die.

01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:00.550
Misa, head out.

01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:02.010
Okay...

01:23:02.960 --> 01:23:04.520
I'm Misa-Misa!

01:23:04.590 --> 01:23:08.220
I won't go nude, but swimsuits
and underwear are okay!

01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:10.690
Pleased to meet you!

01:23:14.670 --> 01:23:17.070
She's really cute in person.

01:23:17.540 --> 01:23:20.200
That's not the problem right now,
don't you think?

01:23:23.850 --> 01:23:25.580
Yes, drink, drink.

01:23:26.050 --> 01:23:27.350
<i>This is heaven.</i>

01:23:28.820 --> 01:23:31.290
Misa's pretty good.

01:23:37.590 --> 01:23:38.580
What's going on?!

01:23:41.660 --> 01:23:44.500
Well...I sure am drunk.

01:23:45.700 --> 01:23:47.970
Now, everyone...
the thing you've been waiting for!

01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:51.170
The Taro Matsui Show!

01:23:53.610 --> 01:23:55.510
Hey, what are you doing?

01:23:57.250 --> 01:23:59.370
Matsui, do it!

01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:07.220
Stop it! It's dangerous!
You idiot!

01:24:07.390 --> 01:24:09.410
It's all right...

01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:30.140
He fell!

01:24:32.910 --> 01:24:34.180
This is bad...

01:24:34.380 --> 01:24:36.250
Oh...no...!

01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:39.190
I came when I heard a thud.
How horrible!

01:24:39.350 --> 01:24:42.120
- 119, 119!
- Honestly. What a horrid role.

01:24:43.060 --> 01:24:46.430
Everyone,
leave this to us and go home.

01:24:46.690 --> 01:24:48.060
Wha? No way...!

01:24:48.360 --> 01:24:51.760
It's all right. Please consider
the advertisement offer.

01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:05.470
Even if we're short of people,
I didn't want to have to do this.

01:25:05.750 --> 01:25:07.740
Matsuda, you idiot...

01:25:17.330 --> 01:25:18.820
Even though the meeting's over,

01:25:18.890 --> 01:25:21.160
I still have to kill criminals
when I get home.

01:25:21.730 --> 01:25:23.530
It sure is tough being Kira.

01:25:24.370 --> 01:25:26.700
But it's getting interesting...

01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:30.770
I'm going to make
Misa Amane my wife.

01:25:36.810 --> 01:25:40.150
Money, power, and a beautiful wife...

01:25:40.820 --> 01:25:43.550
People will be jealous of me...

01:25:46.220 --> 01:25:47.750
Once we're married...

01:25:47.820 --> 01:25:50.020
I'll put a lot of insurance money
on her...

01:25:51.960 --> 01:25:54.720
<i>Would she marry such</i>
<i>a crooked guy?</i>

01:26:00.030 --> 01:26:02.830
This is tiring...

01:26:03.700 --> 01:26:06.500
But it's going well.
I've got to try hard...

01:26:19.490 --> 01:26:22.250
<i>Wh-What is this?!</i>
<i>A monster?</i>

01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:25.890
Misa, you're in a dangerous situation.

01:26:25.960 --> 01:26:29.760
The Yotsuba workers
may kill you.

01:26:30.300 --> 01:26:32.160
I came to tell you that.

01:26:32.500 --> 01:26:34.130
Calm down and listen to me.

01:26:34.540 --> 01:26:38.770
<i>Calm down?</i>
<i>You look more like you would kill me!</i>

01:26:39.710 --> 01:26:41.770
I am your ally.

01:26:42.010 --> 01:26:44.880
<i>My...ally?</i>

01:26:50.420 --> 01:26:52.050
What are you?

01:26:52.120 --> 01:26:56.850
I know you aren't a stalker,
but you don't look human at all...

01:26:57.530 --> 01:27:00.620
Of course. I'm a Shinigami.

01:27:02.260 --> 01:27:06.030
Misa, we once worked together.

01:27:06.430 --> 01:27:08.960
I don't know what
you're talking about...

01:27:10.100 --> 01:27:11.440
The Death Note...

01:27:13.310 --> 01:27:19.580
If you write a person's name in it,
that person dies...

01:27:20.820 --> 01:27:22.010
With that notebook,

01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:27.650
Light Yagami punished criminals
and became known as Kira.

01:27:30.990 --> 01:27:36.620
And you had the same...
no, greater power than Kira.

01:27:37.630 --> 01:27:41.030
Light is Kira...
and I'm Second Kira?

01:27:41.940 --> 01:27:44.370
<i>Ryuzaki's correct.</i>

01:27:47.610 --> 01:27:49.600
When you go back...

01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:52.510
you should be able
to tell who's Kira.

01:27:53.010 --> 01:27:55.210
Be especially wary of him.

01:27:56.580 --> 01:27:58.990
Sorry I took so long
in the restroom.

01:27:59.220 --> 01:28:01.750
I fixed up my makeup.

01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:05.650
Listen, when you return,

01:28:05.730 --> 01:28:09.290
the man who's sitting
in front of me is Kira...

01:28:09.700 --> 01:28:13.260
Rem...The person in front
of Rem is Kira...

01:28:23.240 --> 01:28:24.910
Higuchi is Kira...

01:28:25.350 --> 01:28:26.680
This is really bad...

01:28:34.660 --> 01:28:36.320
<i>Kyosuke Higuchi...</i>

01:28:36.890 --> 01:28:38.860
<i>He's the dirty old man</i>

01:28:38.930 --> 01:28:42.590
<i>who's been sending me</i>
<i>text messages.</i>

01:28:43.930 --> 01:28:47.560
<i>It's really bad that this guy</i>
<i>is Kira...</i>

01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:49.560
Misa...

01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:51.740
Shall we get something to eat?

01:28:52.910 --> 01:28:56.110
Don't take me anywhere strange, okay?

01:28:56.480 --> 01:28:58.710
Well, even if you do
something funny,

01:28:58.780 --> 01:29:01.720
it's all right because
I can kill people.

01:29:03.350 --> 01:29:05.480
What are you talking about, Misa?

01:29:05.990 --> 01:29:09.150
Is this what Light Yagami
wants you to do?

01:29:11.390 --> 01:29:13.690
You say such funny things, Misa.

01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:15.250
You can kill people?

01:29:15.560 --> 01:29:18.330
It's true. Because I'm...

01:29:19.170 --> 01:29:20.660
The Second Kira.

01:29:22.270 --> 01:29:25.300
It's my dream to become
Kira's bride.

01:29:25.370 --> 01:29:27.900
Kira is sure to need me as well.

01:29:29.180 --> 01:29:30.700
<i>If she's the Second Kira...</i>

01:29:30.780 --> 01:29:32.580
<i>then it's clear from</i>
<i>the Sakura TV incident</i>

01:29:32.650 --> 01:29:35.050
<i>that she has the Shinigami eyes...</i>

01:29:35.350 --> 01:29:40.690
<i>But if it is true,</i>
<i>I want to have her by my side.</i>

01:29:41.960 --> 01:29:43.360
<i>I'll test her...</i>

01:29:46.330 --> 01:29:47.990
Ginzo Kaneboshi.

01:29:48.060 --> 01:29:50.190
He's the president of
a major credit consumer business.

01:29:50.260 --> 01:29:53.230
He's a crook who's famous
for his cruel collection methods.

01:29:53.300 --> 01:29:55.770
Sometimes, he makes people
pay with insurance money.

01:29:56.040 --> 01:29:57.230
How about him?

01:29:57.300 --> 01:29:59.470
Can you find out immediately
if he died?

01:29:59.770 --> 01:30:01.370
I can tell if I make a phone call.

01:30:01.440 --> 01:30:03.780
Then turn around for a moment.

01:30:08.380 --> 01:30:09.510
Misa...

01:30:09.580 --> 01:30:12.490
I have to kill Ginzo Kaneboshi, don't I?

01:30:13.020 --> 01:30:15.460
Higuchi will trust you if I do that...

01:30:16.220 --> 01:30:17.280
Fine.

01:30:18.530 --> 01:30:19.930
Ginzo Kaneboshi

01:30:20.560 --> 01:30:22.460
All right. He's dead now.

01:30:25.700 --> 01:30:27.170
This is Higuchi of Yotsuba.

01:30:27.230 --> 01:30:29.670
<i>Sorry! Our president just collapsed</i>
<i>and stopped breathing...</i>

01:30:29.740 --> 01:30:30.970
<i>Call back later!</i>

01:30:37.680 --> 01:30:38.650
See?

01:30:39.580 --> 01:30:43.480
<i>She killed a person that</i>
<i>I chose right here...</i>

01:30:43.650 --> 01:30:47.110
<i>It would have been impossible</i>
<i>unless she had powers!</i>

01:30:47.990 --> 01:30:49.320
It's decided!

01:30:53.490 --> 01:30:56.120
I'm Kira, you'll marry me, right?!

01:30:56.500 --> 01:30:57.930
Prove it.

01:30:58.830 --> 01:31:01.460
I can't kill until I go home.

01:31:01.640 --> 01:31:02.970
You understand.

01:31:03.370 --> 01:31:05.840
Yeah... then it's no good.

01:31:06.270 --> 01:31:09.570
It might be a scheme to
lure me into your house.

01:31:10.880 --> 01:31:12.540
Oh, I know.

01:31:13.610 --> 01:31:16.640
Then stop killing criminals.

01:31:17.020 --> 01:31:19.040
If you're Kira,
I'm sure you can do it.

01:31:19.620 --> 01:31:23.250
Then begin killing when
I tell you to.

01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:24.790
Then I'll believe you.

01:31:25.130 --> 01:31:29.320
Killing criminals is something
that only Kira could do.

01:31:30.260 --> 01:31:32.360
I see. That's a good idea.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:34.990
All right.

01:31:35.270 --> 01:31:38.800
<i>I'm Kira, so in order to</i>
<i>make you trust me,</i>

01:31:38.870 --> 01:31:41.310
<i>I'm going to stop killing criminals</i>
<i>from now.</i>

01:31:41.380 --> 01:31:45.040
<i>And when you know I'm Kira,</i>
<i>we'll get married!</i>

01:31:47.250 --> 01:31:48.980
And so...

01:31:49.920 --> 01:31:51.320
Higuchi is Kira!

01:32:06.430 --> 01:32:09.060
It's been three days since
I stopped killing criminals.

01:32:09.140 --> 01:32:10.770
That's good enough, isn't it?

01:32:11.770 --> 01:32:15.340
Now, if I marry the Second Kira,
Misa Amane...

01:32:15.780 --> 01:32:22.180
I'll get the Shinigami eyes.
And I'll control Yotsuba!

01:32:31.030 --> 01:32:32.360
Higuchi, this is bad.

01:32:32.430 --> 01:32:34.830
Turn on your TV to Sakura TV.

01:32:37.570 --> 01:32:40.370
<i>So one of these people</i>
<i>is Kira, right?</i>

01:32:40.540 --> 01:32:43.270
<i>Yes. I have a lot of proof.</i>

01:32:43.440 --> 01:32:44.740
What is this?

01:32:44.810 --> 01:32:47.870
It's probably a hoax.
It's Sakura TV.

01:32:48.080 --> 01:32:49.810
<i>At the beginning of the program,</i>

01:32:49.880 --> 01:32:53.250
<i>he said that he came across</i>
<i>a meeting of eight people.</i>

01:32:58.290 --> 01:32:59.650
I-It's him!

01:33:03.220 --> 01:33:04.420
Misa's manager...

01:33:04.490 --> 01:33:07.360
I think his name was Matsui!
Why is he alive?!

01:33:09.160 --> 01:33:10.220
<i>Are you all right?</i>

01:33:10.300 --> 01:33:11.430
<i>Shall we stop?</i>

01:33:12.200 --> 01:33:15.030
<i>No... I'm well aware of the danger...</i>

01:33:15.100 --> 01:33:17.400
<i>Even if I'm killed, I shall fight on...</i>

01:33:17.470 --> 01:33:19.370
<i>until the end in the name</i>
<i>of justice.</i>

01:33:19.710 --> 01:33:21.680
That's good. That's good.

01:33:22.040 --> 01:33:23.940
Don't make
the Kira announcement

01:33:24.010 --> 01:33:26.140
until the end of the program.

01:33:26.380 --> 01:33:27.350
This is bad.

01:33:27.420 --> 01:33:29.510
- I don't know when he'll expose me.
<i>- The announcement will come soon.</i>

01:33:29.580 --> 01:33:31.080
<i>Don't change your channel.</i>

01:33:32.850 --> 01:33:34.350
<i>Cosme Misa.</i>

01:33:34.420 --> 01:33:36.910
<i>A devilish charm...</i>
<i>An angel's glitter...</i>

01:33:36.990 --> 01:33:38.290
<i>Misa's winning rouge...</i>

01:33:38.460 --> 01:33:39.790
Mido, it's me.

01:33:39.860 --> 01:33:41.330
Something bad is happening
on Sakura TV.

01:33:41.700 --> 01:33:43.930
Get your father in
the House of Councilors and

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:47.230
<i>have the Ministry of Public Management</i>
<i>stop the program.</i>

01:33:47.970 --> 01:33:50.170
I'm watching,
but that's impossible.

01:33:50.370 --> 01:33:54.040
<i>No one trusts this program</i>
<i>and is suspicious of it.</i>

01:33:55.110 --> 01:33:57.670
<i>Besides, there's nothing</i>
<i>to fear any more.</i>

01:33:57.850 --> 01:33:59.750
<i>That guy revealed his face...</i>

01:33:59.810 --> 01:34:02.410
<i>We can confirm that</i>
<i>it's Taro Matsui.</i>

01:34:03.120 --> 01:34:06.020
<i>Namikawa is telling everyone</i>
<i>to watch this show.</i>

01:34:07.490 --> 01:34:09.720
One of the seven of us is Kira.

01:34:09.790 --> 01:34:11.850
Soon, Taro Matsui will die.

01:34:12.930 --> 01:34:15.860
<i>I see. I'm the only one</i>
<i>who knows</i>

01:34:15.930 --> 01:34:18.630
<i>that Taro Matsui is not</i>
<i>his real name, so...</i>

01:34:19.670 --> 01:34:22.830
<i>If I say that,</i>
<i>then I'll reveal that I'm Kira.</i>

01:34:25.470 --> 01:34:28.000
- You're right. Talk to you later.
<i>- Kira will be revealed shortly!</i>

01:34:29.240 --> 01:34:30.840
<i>Stay with us!</i>

01:34:31.610 --> 01:34:34.170
<i>If he's going to say it at</i>
<i>the end of the program,</i>

01:34:34.250 --> 01:34:35.880
<i>I still have two hours...</i>

01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:50.390
I've confirmed Higuchi.
He's only got a bag on him.

01:34:50.770 --> 01:34:51.600
I'm going after him.

01:34:55.400 --> 01:34:57.530
Everything's going according
to plan, isn't it?

01:34:57.910 --> 01:34:58.840
Yes.

01:35:39.880 --> 01:35:40.850
Taichiro Yamashita

01:35:41.550 --> 01:35:45.010
Now, how are you going to kill?
Show me!

01:35:48.720 --> 01:35:51.160
Taichiro Yamashita

01:35:57.270 --> 01:35:58.130
It's no good.

01:35:58.200 --> 01:36:00.030
He just made a note of his name
and is leaving.

01:36:00.100 --> 01:36:01.590
He's not going to kill him here?

01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:03.870
Ryuzaki! Shall I restrain him?

01:36:04.440 --> 01:36:06.740
I still don't know how he kills.

01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:10.070
He might do something in his car.

01:36:10.580 --> 01:36:12.410
Turn monitor one to Higuchi's car.

01:36:17.420 --> 01:36:19.050
Higuchi is awfully calm

01:36:19.120 --> 01:36:22.060
despite wanting to kill Matsuda
as soon as possible...

01:36:22.890 --> 01:36:25.120
<i>36...37...</i>

01:36:25.190 --> 01:36:27.590
<i>38...39...</i>

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:29.330
<i>40 seconds...</i>

01:36:30.170 --> 01:36:33.930
<i>Kira is a murderer,</i>
<i>so I won't forgive him.</i>

01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:36.770
Crap! He won't die!

01:36:37.070 --> 01:36:38.270
What's the meaning of this?!

01:36:38.340 --> 01:36:39.710
He said, "He won't die!"

01:36:40.180 --> 01:36:41.970
Did he try to kill him already?

01:36:42.710 --> 01:36:45.040
Is writing his name all he has to do?

01:36:51.990 --> 01:36:53.920
Rem. Let's bargain.

01:36:55.060 --> 01:36:56.180
Bargain?

01:36:56.360 --> 01:36:59.690
Could Kira's power be
from heaven or something?

01:37:00.230 --> 01:37:02.960
At any rate, we should watch him.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.330
<i>Now I'm unstoppable...</i>

01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:10.670
<i>With this, I have unlimited options.</i>

01:37:14.040 --> 01:37:14.910
I'm going after him!

01:37:21.250 --> 01:37:25.240
Stop the Porsche.
Pull over to the side of the road.

01:37:29.960 --> 01:37:30.980
This is bad.

01:37:31.130 --> 01:37:33.150
Higuchi has been caught
by a motorcycle policeman.

01:37:33.460 --> 01:37:35.730
You were speeding.
Show me your driver's license!

01:37:36.100 --> 01:37:37.860
Yeah...all right.

01:37:38.100 --> 01:37:40.090
All screens on Higuchi's car...

01:37:40.770 --> 01:37:43.670
Where did I put my license...

01:37:45.840 --> 01:37:47.900
I have no time
to be sticking around here.

01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:51.450
H-Hey!

01:37:51.610 --> 01:37:53.450
Higuchi has ditched
the motorcycle policeman and is escaping!

01:37:54.950 --> 01:37:56.380
This is traffic riot squad...

01:38:02.620 --> 01:38:04.820
Th-The motorcycle policeman
rear-ended a truck!

01:38:04.890 --> 01:38:05.660
It's a collision!

01:38:05.930 --> 01:38:07.730
A collision?!
An accidental death?

01:38:07.960 --> 01:38:09.400
This is bad.

01:38:09.530 --> 01:38:11.000
<i>No, that aside,</i>

01:38:11.070 --> 01:38:13.730
<i>how did he obtain the name</i>
<i>of that motorcycle policeman?</i>

01:38:14.340 --> 01:38:17.100
<i>Could it be that he killed him</i>
<i>by looking at his face like Second Kira?</i>

01:38:17.910 --> 01:38:19.840
Rem... Bargain...

01:38:20.280 --> 01:38:23.470
<i>No... If he could kill just by</i>
<i>looking at someone's face...</i>

01:38:23.540 --> 01:38:26.310
<i>he would have killed</i>
<i>Matsuda already.</i>

01:38:26.510 --> 01:38:28.920
<i>What's going on? But...</i>

01:38:29.320 --> 01:38:30.340
Everyone!

01:38:30.420 --> 01:38:33.220
It's too dangerous to leave
Higuchi alone any longer.

01:38:33.290 --> 01:38:34.780
We will proceed to capture him.

01:38:35.190 --> 01:38:37.680
Higuchi is now able to kill
by looking at someone's face,

01:38:37.760 --> 01:38:39.490
like Second Kira.

01:38:40.460 --> 01:38:42.560
We will capture him with
that in mind!

01:38:43.530 --> 01:38:44.760
<i>This is L.</i>

01:38:44.830 --> 01:38:47.030
<i>We have narrowed down</i>
<i>Kira to a single person.</i>

01:38:47.540 --> 01:38:49.530
<i>Currently, he's heading</i>
<i>from Hibiya to Shibuya</i>

01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:53.230
<i>on highway Route One</i>
<i>in a red Porsche 91 1.</i>

01:38:53.710 --> 01:38:55.540
We shall capture him.

01:38:55.610 --> 01:38:59.740
Instruct all officers
not to approach that Porsche.

01:39:00.550 --> 01:39:03.850
Dad, after the next commercial,
take measure seven.

01:39:04.090 --> 01:39:05.050
Got it.

01:39:05.450 --> 01:39:08.220
Then Yagami, shall we go?

01:39:08.590 --> 01:39:09.520
Yeah.

01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:13.490
Dad...

01:39:13.560 --> 01:39:16.030
Higuchi is almost at Sakura TV.

01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:17.890
He'll be there in less than
fifteen minutes.

01:39:18.130 --> 01:39:19.230
Are you all right?

01:39:19.770 --> 01:39:22.260
I don't want my son
asking me if I'm all right.

01:39:22.700 --> 01:39:23.930
I'm all right, Light.

01:39:24.670 --> 01:39:26.070
<i>We're getting lots of...</i>

01:39:26.140 --> 01:39:29.580
<i>phone calls and faxes</i>
<i>showing support...</i>

01:39:29.640 --> 01:39:33.210
<i>for you, the brave witness.</i>

01:39:35.980 --> 01:39:37.540
<i>I'm very sorry...</i>

01:39:37.650 --> 01:39:38.450
What?!

01:39:38.520 --> 01:39:40.110
<i>But due to circumstances,</i>

01:39:40.190 --> 01:39:42.350
<i>- we will end the program here.</i>
- A mannequin?! No way!

01:39:43.060 --> 01:39:44.460
Stop right there, Higuchi!

01:39:45.030 --> 01:39:45.890
Don't move!

01:39:51.330 --> 01:39:52.860
Give up.

01:39:53.800 --> 01:39:56.640
Y-You must be making
some kind of mistake.

01:39:56.870 --> 01:39:59.900
I had something I wanted to
talk to Demegawa about...

01:40:00.170 --> 01:40:01.900
I'll show you my card...

01:40:07.520 --> 01:40:08.380
Bureau Chief!

01:40:10.590 --> 01:40:13.420
Higuchi has a gun!
The Bureau Chief has been shot.

01:40:13.720 --> 01:40:14.980
Higuchi is getting away!

01:40:15.120 --> 01:40:16.090
I'm all right.

01:40:16.390 --> 01:40:17.720
We have no choice.

01:40:17.790 --> 01:40:20.160
We shall proceed to
capture him as well.

01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:22.330
Watari, are you ready?

01:40:22.830 --> 01:40:23.490
Yes...

01:41:07.540 --> 01:41:08.700
That's as far as you're going.

01:41:15.420 --> 01:41:18.150
Don't come any closer!
Nobody come near me!

01:41:27.730 --> 01:41:28.720
It's over...

01:41:30.300 --> 01:41:31.200
Yes, it is...

01:41:52.150 --> 01:41:56.460
<i>Higuchi... How do you kill people?</i>

01:42:02.200 --> 01:42:03.530
The notebook.

01:42:03.770 --> 01:42:04.790
<i>Notebook?</i>

01:42:05.330 --> 01:42:08.500
You may not believe me,
but if I write the name

01:42:08.570 --> 01:42:10.600
of someone whose face
I know in that notebook,

01:42:10.670 --> 01:42:12.110
that person will die.

01:42:13.240 --> 01:42:14.270
<i>Notebook...</i>

01:42:15.140 --> 01:42:16.080
<i>Yagami.</i>

01:42:16.410 --> 01:42:19.580
Yeah, there is one in Higuchi's bag.

01:42:20.420 --> 01:42:23.110
It has names in it,

01:42:23.190 --> 01:42:24.880
but it looks like
any other notebook...

01:42:28.590 --> 01:42:29.820
What's wrong, Dad?

01:42:30.060 --> 01:42:32.150
Oh...uh...

01:42:32.230 --> 01:42:35.100
I-It seems only people who have touched
this notebook can see this...

01:42:36.130 --> 01:42:37.430
T-This monster...!

01:42:47.310 --> 01:42:49.710
It's a Shinigami...isn't it?

01:42:50.210 --> 01:42:53.980
They...really...do...exist...

01:42:54.420 --> 01:42:56.820
<i>Light Yagami... Amane...</i>
<i>May 22, Aoyama...</i>

01:42:57.190 --> 01:42:59.680
<i>Show notebooks. Love at first sight.</i>
<i>Second Kira...</i>

01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:01.310
Ryuzaki, let me see the notebook.

01:43:01.390 --> 01:43:04.160
<i>Method of killing.</i>
<i>Kira... Second... Two!</i>

01:43:05.560 --> 01:43:08.090
<i>There are more than</i>
<i>two notebooks in existence!</i>

01:43:08.700 --> 01:43:10.130
<i>This isn't over yet...</i>

01:43:27.150 --> 01:43:28.120
<i>I am L.</i>

01:43:30.690 --> 01:43:32.090
<i>I am L.</i>

01:43:39.760 --> 01:43:41.590
A-Are you all right?

01:43:42.600 --> 01:43:44.790
Anyone would be surprised
by that monster...

01:43:46.100 --> 01:43:47.030
Ryuzaki.

01:43:47.470 --> 01:43:48.300
Yes?

01:43:49.070 --> 01:43:51.170
I'm going to cross-check
the names written in here...

01:43:51.240 --> 01:43:53.570
with the names of the victims.

01:43:54.410 --> 01:43:58.370
Huh? Yes...
Well, you're right.

01:44:04.720 --> 01:44:05.920
<i>I've won!</i>

01:44:08.090 --> 01:44:09.820
<i>It's just as I planned.</i>

01:44:12.860 --> 01:44:13.850
Higuchi?!

01:44:13.930 --> 01:44:15.300
Ryuzaki, Higuchi is...!

01:44:15.730 --> 01:44:17.430
Wh-What's this?!
What's going on?!

01:44:19.700 --> 01:44:20.960
Hey, Higuchi!

01:44:21.200 --> 01:44:23.570
Wh-What are you doing, Dad?!

01:44:23.910 --> 01:44:26.270
If Higuchi dies, now...

01:44:26.710 --> 01:44:28.340
I-It can't be!

01:44:28.510 --> 01:44:31.280
No, but, he's already...

01:44:33.550 --> 01:44:35.680
<i>Yeah, he's dead.</i>

01:44:36.950 --> 01:44:38.220
<i>You're next...</i>

01:44:40.160 --> 01:44:41.450
<i>Ryuzaki.</i>

01:45:07.620 --> 01:45:09.640
<i>Light, I remember.</i>

01:45:09.720 --> 01:45:12.190
<i>I remember all about</i>
<i>when I used this notebook.</i>

01:45:18.490 --> 01:45:21.730
<i>Misa, your memory</i>
<i>should have returned</i>

01:45:21.800 --> 01:45:23.820
<i>when you read this message.</i>

01:45:24.530 --> 01:45:26.160
<i>A letter from Light!</i>

01:45:27.540 --> 01:45:30.470
<i>Do you remember</i>
<i>my friend at To-Oh University</i>

01:45:30.540 --> 01:45:32.340
<i>who went by the name</i>
<i>Hideki Ryuga?</i>

01:45:32.940 --> 01:45:36.540
<i>I want you to write his name</i>
<i>in the notebook and kill him.</i>

01:45:37.010 --> 01:45:38.950
<i>Burn this letter.</i>

01:45:39.080 --> 01:45:41.520
<i>Hide a few pages of</i>
<i>the notebook with you...</i>

01:45:41.720 --> 01:45:43.710
<i>And bury the notebook.</i>

01:45:44.750 --> 01:45:46.750
<i>When you meet me again,</i>

01:45:46.820 --> 01:45:49.520
<i>let me touch a clipping of</i>
<i>the notebook in a natural way.</i>

01:45:49.990 --> 01:45:51.620
<i>If you do this,</i>

01:45:51.690 --> 01:45:55.390
<i>I'll love you for</i>
<i>the rest of my life.</i>

01:45:55.960 --> 01:45:56.930
<i>All right!</i>

01:45:57.800 --> 01:46:00.200
<i>I see. This is Light's plan!</i>

01:46:00.640 --> 01:46:03.700
<i>He wanted me to get this notebook,</i>
<i>regain my memory...</i>

01:46:04.840 --> 01:46:07.780
<i>And kill Hideki Ryuga...</i>
<i>Ryuzaki...</i>

01:46:09.580 --> 01:46:11.950
<i>One of Light's obstacles</i>
<i>has disappeared</i>

01:46:12.010 --> 01:46:14.110
<i>and I can help him.</i>

01:46:17.590 --> 01:46:19.580
<i>It's no good... Light...</i>

01:46:20.520 --> 01:46:22.580
<i>I can't remember his name.</i>

01:46:23.490 --> 01:46:28.120
<i>I've seen dozens and hundreds</i>
<i>of names and life spans...</i>

01:46:30.670 --> 01:46:33.640
I just can't remember!
I'm so stupid!

01:46:37.010 --> 01:46:39.070
I can finally come back.

01:46:39.670 --> 01:46:40.800
Ryuk!

01:46:40.880 --> 01:46:42.970
It's been a while...
How are you?

01:46:44.210 --> 01:46:45.240
Sorry, but...

01:46:48.420 --> 01:46:51.110
I'm still male.
You're making me bashful.

01:46:52.750 --> 01:46:55.090
It looks like things went well.

01:46:55.690 --> 01:46:58.290
He planned to relinquish ownership
of the notebook,

01:46:58.360 --> 01:47:01.300
lose his memory and
regain it once more

01:47:01.360 --> 01:47:04.160
by touching the notebook...

01:47:05.670 --> 01:47:08.760
Rem would haunt someone else...
and wait for Light to find her.

01:47:08.840 --> 01:47:11.860
For Light to find her...

01:47:13.640 --> 01:47:17.640
The police have seen
the notebook

01:47:17.710 --> 01:47:21.050
and the fake rules that
Light had me write.

01:47:21.120 --> 01:47:22.850
They're pouring over them
right now...

01:47:24.420 --> 01:47:25.650
Now, Rem...

01:47:26.420 --> 01:47:29.290
Whoever writes a name
in the notebook will die

01:47:29.360 --> 01:47:31.760
unless he writes another name
in the notebook

01:47:31.830 --> 01:47:33.960
within 13 days, right?

01:47:36.600 --> 01:47:37.360
Wha?

01:47:37.670 --> 01:47:38.760
Which means that...

01:47:38.830 --> 01:47:42.200
Light and Misa-Misa are
completely cleared!

01:47:42.440 --> 01:47:44.030
Yes, indeed...

01:47:44.470 --> 01:47:46.700
Light and Amane were detained
for more than fifty days

01:47:46.780 --> 01:47:48.870
and are still under surveillance...

01:47:49.740 --> 01:47:52.480
There's no way they'd still
be alive if they're both Kira.

01:47:54.280 --> 01:47:58.520
Light pulled it off really well...

01:47:59.250 --> 01:48:00.480
Oh yeah...

01:48:00.960 --> 01:48:01.620
Here.

01:48:02.660 --> 01:48:04.290
Light told me to bring this.

01:48:06.930 --> 01:48:08.590
Is it really that delicious?

01:48:08.730 --> 01:48:12.030
Yeah. Apples of the Human World
are juicy?

01:48:12.100 --> 01:48:14.330
Is that what you'd say?
At any rate, they're great.

01:48:16.040 --> 01:48:17.530
Do you want to eat?

01:48:18.840 --> 01:48:21.000
It's an apple from the Shinigami World.

01:48:23.310 --> 01:48:25.280
It doesn't look very good...

01:48:25.350 --> 01:48:26.840
Come on, just one bite.

01:48:28.950 --> 01:48:30.680
Oh yeah, Ryuk...

01:48:30.950 --> 01:48:32.980
Do the eye bargain with me.

01:48:37.290 --> 01:48:38.730
Sand!

01:48:44.400 --> 01:48:45.770
A bargain, huh?

01:48:47.800 --> 01:48:49.290
You understand, don't you?

01:48:49.770 --> 01:48:52.900
You've made a bargain
with Rem once before.

01:48:53.070 --> 01:48:57.710
Do you really want to halve
your life a second time?

01:48:58.910 --> 01:49:00.970
Well, that can't be helped...

01:49:01.520 --> 01:49:05.150
I've forgotten the name
I had to remember...

01:49:05.220 --> 01:49:08.350
Light will be angry with me
if I don't take a look at it again.

01:49:09.960 --> 01:49:12.050
Well, I'm okay with that...

01:49:19.230 --> 01:49:20.670
Oh, it's Misa-Misa.

01:49:20.970 --> 01:49:21.990
Ryuk!

01:49:22.500 --> 01:49:24.470
Why is he haunting Misa?

01:49:28.810 --> 01:49:31.870
Misa's life has been halved
once more!

01:49:32.180 --> 01:49:35.240
Did she...do the eye bargain with Ryuk?!

01:49:38.050 --> 01:49:39.080
Light...

01:49:44.630 --> 01:49:46.490
It's been a while, Ryuk.

01:49:57.810 --> 01:50:00.740
Misa, right now,
I feel like living with you

01:50:00.810 --> 01:50:03.970
in my ideal new world for
a long, long time.

01:50:04.210 --> 01:50:06.010
Light, I'm so happy!

01:50:06.620 --> 01:50:09.810
Misa, let's make
a new crimeless world together.

01:50:09.890 --> 01:50:12.880
One with only kind and
innocent people in it.

01:50:13.390 --> 01:50:14.410
Yeah!

01:50:30.910 --> 01:50:33.340
What's wrong, Ryuzaki?

01:50:41.680 --> 01:50:42.810
What's wrong?

01:51:44.280 --> 01:51:47.410
? Careful

01:51:48.350 --> 01:51:52.250
? God is watching.

01:51:52.890 --> 01:52:00.960
? Please hold my hand
on dark nights.

01:52:01.500 --> 01:52:05.400
? Even if you're far away
by yourself.

01:52:05.700 --> 01:52:11.940
? You always find me...

01:52:12.140 --> 01:52:19.570
? You tell me everything
you know.

01:52:20.750 --> 01:52:25.280
? Even if I don't remember...

01:52:25.350 --> 01:52:34.660
? You tell me many times.

01:52:38.630 --> 01:52:48.630
? But what do I do once
I know everything?

01:52:59.290 --> 01:53:00.550
What do you mean?

01:53:01.320 --> 01:53:03.050
Criminals are dying again?!

01:53:03.460 --> 01:53:05.260
There were fourteen
just yesterday.

01:53:05.560 --> 01:53:07.830
They were broadcast
after Higuchi died...

01:53:08.200 --> 01:53:09.860
Immediately, huh?

01:53:10.200 --> 01:53:13.690
I guess that means that Higuchi
wasn't necessarily Kira...

01:53:13.970 --> 01:53:16.940
No. We're positive that Higuchi
was the one killing criminals

01:53:17.010 --> 01:53:18.670
until we caught him.

01:53:18.840 --> 01:53:21.900
Then does that mean that
another Kira has appeared?

01:53:22.350 --> 01:53:25.140
Oh...why?!

01:53:25.210 --> 01:53:27.450
Crap... curse you, Kira...

01:53:28.080 --> 01:53:30.850
<i>Kira appears now...</i>
<i>What's going on?</i>

01:53:32.360 --> 01:53:33.910
<i>Oh no...</i>

01:53:34.960 --> 01:53:36.480
<i>There's only Misa...</i>

01:53:37.290 --> 01:53:39.790
This happened as soon
as Amane was freed, didn't it?

01:53:40.060 --> 01:53:42.220
Ryuzaki, are you still saying that?

01:53:42.630 --> 01:53:44.030
Misa is not involved.

01:53:44.800 --> 01:53:47.330
It happened as soon
as Higuchi died.

01:53:48.140 --> 01:53:49.440
You're right...

01:53:51.410 --> 01:53:56.510
Well, if there is another notebook
and someone is using it...

01:53:58.480 --> 01:54:00.920
I'll catch him.

01:54:07.290 --> 01:54:09.780
<i>The Shinigami told me</i>
<i>he doesn't know, but...</i>

01:54:10.460 --> 01:54:11.890
<i>If someone can kill</i>

01:54:11.960 --> 01:54:14.800
<i>by writing a name on</i>
<i>a clipping from the notebook...</i>

01:54:18.200 --> 01:54:19.790
<i>It's not impossible...</i>

01:54:20.540 --> 01:54:24.200
<i>But...whoever writes</i>
<i>a name in this notebook...</i>

01:54:24.410 --> 01:54:27.940
<i>has to write another name</i>
<i>within thirteen days or die...</i>

01:54:29.250 --> 01:54:32.080
<i>Light Yagami and Misa Amane</i>
<i>are living...</i>

01:54:33.050 --> 01:54:36.250
<i>Thirteen days...</i>
<i>It's only that fact...</i>

01:54:38.120 --> 01:54:40.280
Ryuzaki, even if we do
catch the person

01:54:40.360 --> 01:54:42.420
who was writing in the notebook...

01:54:42.960 --> 01:54:47.290
Can we really convict and
punish him for mass murder?

01:54:47.530 --> 01:54:50.230
Of course we can!

01:54:50.300 --> 01:54:54.200
He wrote countless names
knowing that people would die.

01:54:54.340 --> 01:54:55.930
We should kill him

01:54:56.010 --> 01:54:58.440
if we don't want the existence
of the notebook to go public.

01:54:59.410 --> 01:55:01.710
Killing him isn't a very
level-headed reaction,

01:55:01.780 --> 01:55:04.470
but our superiors would probably
take measures like that.

01:55:05.150 --> 01:55:06.620
If he admits to killing
with the notebook,

01:55:06.680 --> 01:55:08.240
he would receive
the death penalty.

01:55:08.320 --> 01:55:10.050
Or at least a life sentence.

01:55:12.050 --> 01:55:13.780
Something like that.

01:55:14.360 --> 01:55:17.230
<i>What are you thinking,</i>
<i>Light Yagami?</i>

01:55:17.930 --> 01:55:20.290
<i>If Misa is caught,</i>
<i>you'd be caught too...</i>

01:55:22.600 --> 01:55:26.870
<i>So that's it!</i>
<i>What a bastard!</i>

01:55:28.700 --> 01:55:34.010
<i>Light Yagami is sure that</i>
<i>I'll save Misa's life...</i>

01:55:34.540 --> 01:55:36.980
<i>In order to save Misa</i>
<i>in this situation,</i>

01:55:37.050 --> 01:55:41.280
<i>I have to write Ryuzaki's real name</i>
<i>in my notebook...</i>

01:55:41.850 --> 01:55:44.790
<i>And if I kill Ryuzaki...</i>

01:55:46.890 --> 01:55:51.550
<i>It'll be something related to</i>
<i>Misa's life and I'll die as well...</i>

01:55:52.060 --> 01:55:56.260
<i>Light Yagami is making</i>
<i>everything go his way...</i>

01:55:59.100 --> 01:56:00.400
<i>What are you going to do, Rem?</i>

01:56:00.770 --> 01:56:03.760
<i>I know full well that</i>
<i>despite being a Shinigami,</i>

01:56:03.840 --> 01:56:05.540
<i>you're infatuated with Misa.</i>

01:56:06.610 --> 01:56:09.100
<i>Misa's life has been</i>
<i>halved once more.</i>

01:56:09.180 --> 01:56:11.150
<i>There's no way</i>
<i>you'd leave her alone.</i>

01:56:11.810 --> 01:56:13.910
<i>Think about Misa's happiness.</i>

01:56:48.950 --> 01:56:51.680
What are you doing there, Ryuzaki?

01:56:56.830 --> 01:56:59.660
What are you doing there, Ryuzaki?!

01:57:12.610 --> 01:57:14.440
What are you doing, Ryuzaki?

01:57:15.110 --> 01:57:18.410
No... I'm not doing anything
in particular, but...

01:57:19.820 --> 01:57:21.250
The sound of the bells...

01:57:21.980 --> 01:57:23.210
Bells?

01:57:23.790 --> 01:57:25.020
Yes.

01:57:25.250 --> 01:57:28.280
I've been hearing noisy bells
throughout the day...

01:57:32.460 --> 01:57:34.120
I don't hear anything.

01:57:34.830 --> 01:57:39.130
Really? They've been ringing
all day and...

01:57:39.200 --> 01:57:41.530
I can't help but be curious...

01:57:42.510 --> 01:57:45.370
Do you suppose it's a church?
A wedding?

01:57:46.210 --> 01:57:48.730
- Or perhaps...
- What are you talking about, Ryuzaki?

01:57:49.110 --> 01:57:51.640
Don't say silly things.
Let's go back.

01:57:53.150 --> 01:57:54.550
Sorry.

01:57:55.580 --> 01:57:58.420
Everything I say is a lie, so...

01:57:58.590 --> 01:58:00.520
Don't believe any of it.

01:58:09.700 --> 01:58:11.100
That's right, Ryuzaki.

01:58:11.830 --> 01:58:14.390
Most of what you say is a lie.

01:58:14.840 --> 01:58:17.710
There would be no end if
I took you seriously all the time.

01:58:17.970 --> 01:58:20.570
I know that very well.

01:58:21.540 --> 01:58:24.510
Yes, that's right, Light.

01:58:26.750 --> 01:58:30.280
But... it's true for both of us.

01:58:32.090 --> 01:58:33.420
What do you mean?

01:58:35.290 --> 01:58:40.250
Have you ever told the truth
at any point since you were born?

01:58:46.670 --> 01:58:48.640
What are you talking about, Ryuzaki?

01:58:49.210 --> 01:58:51.400
It's true that I lie once
in a while.

01:58:52.140 --> 01:58:55.870
But how many people live
their entire lives

01:58:55.950 --> 01:58:57.500
only telling the truth?

01:58:58.750 --> 01:59:01.580
Humans aren't perfect.

01:59:02.020 --> 01:59:05.450
Everyone lies. Even so...

01:59:05.820 --> 01:59:09.780
I've tried not to tell lies
that hurt others.

01:59:10.430 --> 01:59:11.920
That's my answer.

01:59:15.630 --> 01:59:17.430
I thought you'd say that.

01:59:30.750 --> 01:59:33.650
Oh, Ryuzaki!
What is the meaning of this?!

01:59:33.820 --> 01:59:35.580
I heard that you got an approval
from a certain country

01:59:35.650 --> 01:59:37.280
to use the notebook for
an execution!

01:59:37.720 --> 01:59:40.160
Watari...
Good work.

01:59:40.390 --> 01:59:42.520
<i>- You're welcome.</i>
- Right off...

01:59:42.830 --> 01:59:45.420
Make arrangements
to transport the notebook.

01:59:45.630 --> 01:59:46.930
<i>Yes.</i>

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:48.830
Ryuzaki, what's the meaning
of this?

01:59:49.870 --> 01:59:52.270
It means that I'm going to
try out the notebook for real.

01:59:53.900 --> 01:59:56.370
That's pointless.
We don't have to do that.

01:59:56.610 --> 01:59:58.840
We already know that the power
of the notebook is real, don't we?

01:59:58.940 --> 02:00:01.240
Besides, who's going
to write the name?

02:00:01.310 --> 02:00:02.370
Once you write in the notebook,

02:00:02.440 --> 02:00:06.780
you have to continue writing
names every thirteen days!

02:00:07.080 --> 02:00:09.240
The one who's going to
write the name

02:00:09.320 --> 02:00:13.120
is someone who'll be executed
within thirteen days.

02:00:13.190 --> 02:00:15.120
If he's still alive after thirteen days...

02:00:15.560 --> 02:00:18.320
We've made a judicial bargain
to exempt him from execution.

02:00:19.560 --> 02:00:22.620
- But we can't sacrifice people's lives...
- Just a little more.

02:00:23.430 --> 02:00:26.960
If we just clear this up...
We'll solve the case.

02:00:32.340 --> 02:00:34.440
Wh-What's this?!
A blackout?!

02:00:45.550 --> 02:00:46.580
Watari?

02:00:48.790 --> 02:00:49.820
Wata!

02:00:53.500 --> 02:00:56.190
Data deletion?
What's the meaning of this?!

02:00:56.670 --> 02:01:00.630
I told Watari to erase
all information...

02:01:00.700 --> 02:01:03.570
in the event that something
happens to him.

02:01:04.010 --> 02:01:05.630
If something happens?

02:01:05.870 --> 02:01:07.270
It can't be...

02:01:07.380 --> 02:01:08.610
Where's the Shinigami?

02:01:08.680 --> 02:01:10.170
Come to think of it,
I don't see him...

02:01:12.850 --> 02:01:14.010
He's not anywhere!

02:01:14.080 --> 02:01:15.350
What's the meaning of this?!

02:01:15.450 --> 02:01:19.820
Everyone... The Shiniga...mi...

02:01:48.120 --> 02:01:50.420
R-Ryuzaki!
What's wrong?!

02:02:36.300 --> 02:02:38.390
Hey! Ryuzaki!

02:02:38.600 --> 02:02:40.730
What's wrong?!
Get a hold of yourself!

02:02:40.800 --> 02:02:42.770
- What's this?!
- What's going on?

02:02:46.080 --> 02:02:47.340
Calm down, Light!
We're going to be killed!

02:02:47.410 --> 02:02:51.570
We're going to be killed!
Watari, Ryuzaki, we're next!

02:03:04.730 --> 02:03:06.220
Crap.

02:03:06.730 --> 02:03:09.290
Where are you, Shinigami?!
Come out!

02:03:09.470 --> 02:03:11.020
L-Light!

02:03:11.100 --> 02:03:13.540
You should know something!

02:03:13.700 --> 02:03:15.000
Come out!

02:03:40.330 --> 02:03:41.990
Ryuzaki...

02:03:42.360 --> 02:03:47.270
We held your funeral
without informing anyone...

02:03:48.700 --> 02:03:51.730
We're going to pretend you're alive

02:03:51.810 --> 02:03:56.510
and move the world's police
as if nothing has changed...

02:03:57.850 --> 02:04:02.720
We'll catch Kira. I promise you.

02:04:04.290 --> 02:04:06.410
Rest in peace...

02:04:09.260 --> 02:04:10.560
That's right...

02:04:12.090 --> 02:04:14.260
Let's avenge Ryuzaki!

02:04:15.630 --> 02:04:19.930
Solving this case will
be our parting gift...

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.560
For Watari and the other victims sake...

02:04:22.640 --> 02:04:24.470
And for everyone...

02:04:25.170 --> 02:04:31.770
I will get Kira executed.

02:04:38.550 --> 02:04:39.950
Light...

02:04:47.360 --> 02:04:48.660
Matsuda.

02:05:00.110 --> 02:05:03.700
L's finally gone...

02:05:04.410 --> 02:05:08.440
I guess I can't expect things to
be very interesting anymore...

02:05:29.710 --> 02:05:32.170
Everyone in my way is gone.

02:05:32.870 --> 02:05:35.280
Everyone else believes me.

02:05:36.350 --> 02:05:39.250
It's only a matter of time before
I control the police!

02:05:39.580 --> 02:05:41.280
What do you think, L?

02:05:41.880 --> 02:05:43.750
I've completely won!

02:05:44.350 --> 02:05:46.980
I win!

02:06:06.980 --> 02:06:11.710
Ryuk, you don't expect things
to be very interesting?

02:06:13.250 --> 02:06:17.340
That's not true. From here on...

02:06:20.860 --> 02:06:23.660
You'll get to observe the making
of a new world.

02:07:08.770 --> 02:07:14.000
I am...the god...

02:07:15.880 --> 02:07:17.510
of the new world...

02:07:28.460 --> 02:07:33.590
Light Yagami

02:07:35.100 --> 02:07:39.160
You weren't a god at that moment...

02:07:39.770 --> 02:07:41.460
You were more like...

02:07:47.680 --> 02:07:49.170
So you're gone...

02:07:53.380 --> 02:07:57.440
Go and see...
If you're lucky...

02:07:57.520 --> 02:08:00.550
Someone amazing will
pick up the Death Note...

02:08:00.660 --> 02:08:02.780
And you'll get to see
something interesting

02:08:02.860 --> 02:08:05.380
that you'll never forget.

02:08:09.500 --> 02:08:13.900
Isn't that right...

02:08:13.970 --> 02:08:15.300
Light?
