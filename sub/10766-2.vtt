00:09.688 --> 00:10.950
Shabba!

00:15.193 --> 00:19.061
- Will, get your feet off the furniture.
- I'm sorry about that, Uncle Phil.

00:19.131 --> 00:21.258
- Why aren't you doing your homework?
- No, see, I was just...

00:21.333 --> 00:24.530
How many times have I told you
not to eat on the couch?

00:26.371 --> 00:28.703
And while we're on the subject...

00:32.244 --> 00:34.974
It's kind of fly, right?
Don't you wish you lived on TV?

02:02.634 --> 02:05.660
Must be what it sounds like to wake up
in Little Richard's crib.

02:06.705 --> 02:09.639
What's with Dad, anyway,
waking us up at 6:00 a. M?

02:09.708 --> 02:11.869
Now I'll never know how that dream ends.

02:12.177 --> 02:13.667
She dumps you, Carlton.

02:15.647 --> 02:18.343
Hey, look, all I'm saying is,
just 'cause he own the crib...

02:18.417 --> 02:21.318
and pay all the bills and everything,
he think he can tell us what to do.

02:21.386 --> 02:23.377
Now, I don't know about y'all,
but I ain't having it.

02:23.455 --> 02:26.015
I think it's time for somebody
to straighten him out.

02:28.627 --> 02:29.992
Step to it, Ash.

02:30.629 --> 02:33.427
Will, we're going to go down
and help rebuild the old neighborhood...

02:33.498 --> 02:35.625
and I don't want any attitude from you.

02:35.767 --> 02:36.756
What?

02:37.335 --> 02:39.565
I had a fabulous time, Wesley.

02:40.205 --> 02:44.005
Why don't you come in?
Don't be silly, they won't be up for hours.

02:46.712 --> 02:48.441
Night, Sister Mary Margaret.

02:50.615 --> 02:53.345
Daddy, have you lost weight?

02:53.518 --> 02:54.951
Hilary.

02:56.021 --> 02:58.683
Sister Mary Margaret drives a Porsche?

02:59.357 --> 03:01.825
Man, they must got it going on
down at the convent, huh?

03:02.861 --> 03:04.590
Hilary, what were you doing out all night?

03:04.696 --> 03:07.893
I wasn't out all night,
I just got up early to go to mass.

03:09.634 --> 03:13.968
- We're not Catholic.
- Well, is my face red. Good night.

03:14.039 --> 03:17.600
Hold it, young lady. I want you
to go upstairs and change your clothes.

03:17.776 --> 03:20.404
We're meeting Reverend Williams
and the church group in half an hour.

03:20.479 --> 03:21.673
<i>E</i> xcuse me?

03:21.747 --> 03:24.545
Y ou said you'd come down to the old
neighborhood with us. Remember?

03:24.616 --> 03:26.584
I also said Daddy lost weight.

03:27.319 --> 03:30.220
Hilary, go change your clothes. Now!

03:30.288 --> 03:32.722
This is too important.
I'm not gonna let you get out of this.

03:32.858 --> 03:34.723
Boy, Uncle Phil and Aunt Viv
sure are hyped up...

03:34.793 --> 03:36.454
about going down
to their old neighborhood.

03:36.528 --> 03:38.393
Brother, I can just hear them now:

03:38.463 --> 03:41.261
"Look, kids, this is where we lived
when we first got married.

03:41.333 --> 03:44.029
"And this is the little park
where we walked little Hilary."

03:44.102 --> 03:47.230
"And, look, there's the pet store
where we bought little Carlton."

03:49.875 --> 03:53.675
I think it's cute. They're going to be
mushy and lovey-dovey all day.

03:53.745 --> 03:55.872
Vivian, what the hell is the matter
with you?

03:55.981 --> 03:59.439
Y ou've been avoiding me ever since
I got home yesterday. What did I do?

03:59.518 --> 04:02.976
Come on, tell me. Is it something that
I did, or something that I didn't do or...

04:03.555 --> 04:04.920
Oh, my God.

04:11.163 --> 04:12.755
Happy anniversary, sweetheart.

04:13.632 --> 04:16.362
- It's not our anniversary, Philip.
- Oh, God, good.

04:16.567 --> 04:18.433
Well, what is it?

04:18.503 --> 04:21.028
- Y ou're wearing that shirt.
- Why not?

04:21.273 --> 04:22.262
It's my around-the-house shirt.

04:22.340 --> 04:24.467
I've worn it around the house
every weekend for years.

04:24.543 --> 04:28.604
That's what I mean.
Philip, you have become so predictable.

04:28.947 --> 04:32.246
Vivian, don't you think you're being
just a wee bit erratic this morning?

04:32.317 --> 04:34.046
Absolutely not.

04:35.487 --> 04:39.514
Philip, look at my hair.
I can't go out like this.

04:39.825 --> 04:41.622
I gotta go to the salon.

04:41.693 --> 04:43.251
Well, you went yesterday, sweetheart...

04:43.328 --> 04:45.626
that's why we couldn't
have lunch together.

04:45.730 --> 04:46.924
Right, you're right.

04:47.098 --> 04:49.157
Henri tried something new, do you like it?

04:51.069 --> 04:53.094
Will, what do you think?

04:53.805 --> 04:54.794
Will!

04:57.375 --> 04:59.605
Well, actually, Aunt Viv, you got a...

04:59.811 --> 05:02.302
kind of a Don King...

05:04.583 --> 05:09.577
Kris Kross, Bride of Frankenthing going.

05:10.222 --> 05:11.849
Not many people could pull it off.

05:11.923 --> 05:16.553
Y ou know, as you're proving, right, but...

05:17.963 --> 05:19.021
What, Carlton?

05:19.731 --> 05:22.461
Vivian, where were you yesterday?

05:23.735 --> 05:25.703
Shooting baskets with Michael Jordon.

05:31.343 --> 05:33.903
Y ou know,
Clair would never talk to Cliff like that.

05:38.750 --> 05:40.149
What, Carlton?

05:50.362 --> 05:53.854
Y o, my brother, when the going
gets tough, the tough gets going.

05:54.399 --> 05:56.026
It's Hammer time.

05:59.371 --> 06:01.703
Sorry about that, man, you know,
you have to excuse my cousin...

06:01.773 --> 06:04.003
you know, he's an idiot.

06:06.912 --> 06:09.073
Carlton, can you please relax, man?

06:09.147 --> 06:12.548
Okay, I won't say another word.
I won't even make eye contact.

06:13.718 --> 06:15.310
Oh, God, what a stallion.

06:16.788 --> 06:18.449
Time to saddle up.

06:21.026 --> 06:22.015
Y o, what's up, baby?

06:22.093 --> 06:24.561
Hurry up, write your number down
before I don't want it no more.

06:28.400 --> 06:30.493
I'm sorry. How are you doing?

06:30.568 --> 06:33.230
I'm Will and this is my cousin, Carlton.

06:33.305 --> 06:34.465
Hi, I'm Simone.

06:34.539 --> 06:37.372
Thanks for coming down.
I'm going to show you what to do.

06:37.442 --> 06:39.273
And I'm going to buy you a car.

06:41.079 --> 06:42.137
No, thanks.

06:42.213 --> 06:44.374
But I do need a strong pair of arms.

06:44.449 --> 06:46.440
That would be me. I got that.

06:46.785 --> 06:50.312
Carlton can't help you,
he's on the debate team.

06:52.324 --> 06:55.054
Really, I'm captain of my debate team.

06:59.064 --> 07:01.692
Simone, where you want me
to go with this?

07:02.300 --> 07:05.633
How about over there somewhere,
like, say, Cleveland?

07:08.039 --> 07:11.133
Tell me to go to Cleveland,
mushroom head.

07:15.480 --> 07:17.971
Well, I guess we better get busy.

07:18.049 --> 07:19.414
All right!

07:21.519 --> 07:22.884
Oh, right.

07:35.300 --> 07:38.531
Listen, Simone, why don't you
come by the school on Monday...

07:38.603 --> 07:40.264
we're debating <i>Roe v. Wade.</i>

07:40.505 --> 07:42.336
Oh, reproductive rights!

07:42.741 --> 07:45.539
No, row versus wade,
the best way to cross a stream.

07:51.282 --> 07:53.011
Y ou've got a great sense of humor.

07:53.084 --> 07:54.483
Y eah, I know.

08:00.759 --> 08:03.751
- What's the matter?
- It's just a splinter.

08:04.829 --> 08:07.263
Better let me take a look
at that finger for you.

08:29.854 --> 08:32.186
- Damn!
- Problem, sir?

08:32.624 --> 08:35.616
It's Vivian.
I don't know what's gotten into her.

08:36.061 --> 08:37.961
This morning she told me
that I've become too...

08:38.029 --> 08:40.861
- Predictable, sir?
- Y es, that's exactly what she said.

08:41.131 --> 08:44.465
- She said that I wear the same...
- Blue shirt every weekend, sir?

08:44.536 --> 08:47.835
Y es, I mean, just because a man has...

08:47.906 --> 08:49.430
Froot Loops every morning.

08:49.507 --> 08:52.032
- Just because I watch...
- <i>Lega/ Beag/es</i> every night.

08:52.110 --> 08:53.873
Does that mean
that I've become predictable?

08:53.945 --> 08:56.413
Absolutely not, sir.

08:56.614 --> 08:59.708
Why, you're a regular
hotbed of spontaneity.

09:00.618 --> 09:02.415
- Y ou're welcome.
- Thank you.

09:14.399 --> 09:16.924
Hilary, why doesn't anyone want my soda?

09:17.001 --> 09:19.595
Because your soda's flat.

09:24.642 --> 09:27.406
Do you believe this mess, man?
I thought we was here to work.

09:27.479 --> 09:30.880
Don't even sweat it, man. Most of those
fools ain't coming back here, anyway.

09:30.949 --> 09:33.281
A few more months, everybody's
conscience will be cleared...

09:33.351 --> 09:35.182
and things will be back to status quo.

09:36.020 --> 09:39.456
Half these people don't even understand
what really went down here, man.

09:39.757 --> 09:40.746
Y eah.

09:41.793 --> 09:43.886
- Hey, I'm Noah, man.
- Hey, what's up? Will.

09:45.430 --> 09:47.455
And then when I was 12, I played Maria...

09:47.532 --> 09:49.727
in an all-boy production
of <i>West Side Story.</i>

09:56.941 --> 09:58.636
Carlton, slow down.

09:58.743 --> 10:00.938
I want to hear more
about your collection of Sea-Monkeys.

10:02.647 --> 10:04.308
Will you marry me?

10:08.219 --> 10:10.414
Well, there go the nerdyweds.

10:15.593 --> 10:18.892
Vivian, wait.
Now, you cannot avoid me all day.

10:19.097 --> 10:20.758
Now, where were you yesterday?

10:20.832 --> 10:24.495
Philip, I love you sweetheart.
Trust me, you're my husband.

10:24.569 --> 10:26.833
And, as your husband,
I have a right to an explanation.

10:26.905 --> 10:28.566
And, as your wife...

10:28.840 --> 10:31.070
when I think of something,
you'll be the first one to know.

10:31.142 --> 10:32.939
Don't... I'm not finished
with you yet, woman.

10:33.011 --> 10:34.842
Well, I'm through with you, man.

10:36.347 --> 10:37.939
Y eah, that's right, I'm bad.

10:55.266 --> 10:58.702
Man, I'm beat.
Got blisters on top of blisters.

10:58.770 --> 10:59.964
Y eah, me, too.

11:00.038 --> 11:01.733
Hey, so what time
you coming back tomorrow?

11:01.806 --> 11:04.900
I can't make it tomorrow, man.
I got school and everything, you know.

11:04.976 --> 11:08.434
Oh, yeah. Well, I'll get with you
next weekend, then.

11:08.880 --> 11:11.280
Oh, man. Well, I can't make it
next weekend, you know...

11:11.349 --> 11:14.580
I got a date on Saturday
and then I got a ball game on Sunday.

11:14.652 --> 11:17.951
- So, you know how it is, man.
- Y eah, I know how it is.

11:18.423 --> 11:20.323
Y ou're not coming back.

11:23.828 --> 11:26.262
Wait, hold up, man, I'm coming back.

11:26.431 --> 11:28.194
No, you're not, man.

11:28.566 --> 11:31.126
I bet you feel pretty good
about yourself, don't you?

11:31.202 --> 11:33.432
I mean, you come down here,
do the right thing...

11:33.504 --> 11:37.372
then you go home patting yourself on the
back 'cause you helped out the poor folk.

11:38.343 --> 11:42.143
Hold up, man. Y o, I'm from Philly.
We had to save up to be poor.

11:46.718 --> 11:48.811
Why you sweating me like this man,
what's up?

11:48.886 --> 11:51.116
'Cause, you're just like all the rest of them.

11:51.189 --> 11:53.919
Y ou come around here with the X cap
and them cool Doc Martens...

11:53.992 --> 11:55.823
and you're all "dope"
and "word to your mother."

11:55.893 --> 11:57.383
And you think that makes you committed?

11:58.863 --> 12:00.888
Let me tell you something,
this ain't no game.

12:00.999 --> 12:03.058
And if you think that it is,
then maybe you should go home...

12:03.134 --> 12:04.692
'cause you're not welcome here.

12:05.970 --> 12:07.961
Tell Dan Quayle I said, "What's up."

12:15.513 --> 12:17.242
Now I'm not welcome here, right?

12:17.315 --> 12:19.340
Well, you got your story
a little wrong, homey.

12:19.417 --> 12:21.078
This community appreciates me.

12:22.687 --> 12:24.211
I don't even know Dan Quayle.

12:27.859 --> 12:30.054
Hey, I'm going to
knock your head off, slimeball.

12:30.561 --> 12:31.619
Y o, man!

12:37.435 --> 12:39.266
Help!

12:40.805 --> 12:41.863
Shut up, bad man.

12:41.939 --> 12:43.531
Put your hands up and
put down the toaster.

12:43.608 --> 12:45.974
Put your hands up in the air,
put down the toaster.

12:46.044 --> 12:48.478
Make up your mind, man.
What do you want me to do first?

12:48.579 --> 12:50.945
Will! What the hell is going on in here?

12:52.417 --> 12:55.716
Dad, don't do anything stupid,
you haven't updated your will yet.

12:58.589 --> 13:00.784
Oh, my God. Hector?

13:01.292 --> 13:02.884
Y eah, what? Wait...

13:04.362 --> 13:06.387
Wait a minute, I know you.

13:06.464 --> 13:08.864
Y eah, ain't you
the guy from <i>Fami/y Matters?</i>

13:09.701 --> 13:13.899
- Y es!
- No, I'm Philip. Philip Banks.

13:14.372 --> 13:15.396
- Curly?
- Y eah.

13:15.940 --> 13:16.929
Oh, my God!

13:19.811 --> 13:22.006
Curly? They must go way back.

13:22.747 --> 13:26.808
Vivian, come here quick.
Oh, my God, what's it been, years?

13:29.287 --> 13:32.484
Oh, I don't believe it. It's Hector Alvarez.

13:34.092 --> 13:35.992
Oh, kids, look it's Hector.

13:36.761 --> 13:37.750
Hector!

13:38.596 --> 13:40.120
How are you?

13:41.165 --> 13:43.759
- Y ou look wonderful.
- So do you.

13:44.369 --> 13:46.132
- Who's Hector?
- I don't know, but be nice to him...

13:46.204 --> 13:47.228
he's got a bat.

13:48.272 --> 13:51.264
Stay where you are, punk.
I caught this little creep stealing.

13:51.342 --> 13:52.809
I'll go call the police.

13:54.011 --> 13:55.205
I got a quarter.

13:55.980 --> 13:59.780
Now, hold on. Hector,
there must be some mistake. This is...

13:59.917 --> 14:02.613
y eah, this is our nephew, Will.

14:03.020 --> 14:04.851
Y ou mean little Willie from Philly?

14:06.724 --> 14:09.784
But, of course, who else could it be
with those <i>muy grandes orejas?</i>

14:13.564 --> 14:15.896
- What does that mean?
- Big ears.

14:20.371 --> 14:23.169
Hector, let me see that bat for a second.

14:23.574 --> 14:26.566
I'm sorry about the bat, folks.
Y ou know, I guess I'm a little jumpy.

14:26.644 --> 14:28.771
I've been robbed a couple of times, man.

14:31.182 --> 14:33.207
- I'm sorry to hear that, Hector.
- Y eah.

14:33.284 --> 14:35.343
Come on, now, kids,
you remember Hector.

14:35.420 --> 14:36.717
I'll remember him now!

14:37.488 --> 14:40.286
Sweetheart, before you were born,
we used to live here.

14:40.391 --> 14:42.882
Right above Hector's grocery store.

14:42.960 --> 14:45.326
Wait, this is the old apartment?

14:45.496 --> 14:48.090
Hector, I love what you've done
with the place.

14:50.868 --> 14:54.099
Well, we didn't have a lot,
but we always had enough to eat...

14:54.172 --> 14:55.799
- thanks to Hector.
- That's right.

14:55.873 --> 14:58.501
<i>E</i> ven if you didn't have any money,
you had all the food you needed...

14:58.576 --> 15:00.510
long as he liked you.

15:00.578 --> 15:02.842
I guess y'all was in love then,
huh, Uncle Phil?

15:08.386 --> 15:11.184
So, Perry Mason, how is the crusading
business coming, man?

15:11.255 --> 15:12.688
Are you still fighting
for little guys like me?

15:12.757 --> 15:15.624
Well, I'm still fighting,
but it's corporate mergers mostly.

15:15.693 --> 15:18.127
So you're not working out
of a little storefront anymore?

15:18.196 --> 15:19.993
Well, no, my office has gotten
a little bit bigger...

15:20.064 --> 15:21.395
but it's just a few miles from here.

15:21.466 --> 15:23.434
Y ou work in Beverly Hills, Uncle Phil.

15:24.469 --> 15:26.801
Beverly Hills. Hey, Curly, that's terrific!

15:27.104 --> 15:29.937
Hey, maybe now you can pay me back
for some of those Ring Dings?

15:30.875 --> 15:32.866
He ain't doing that well.

15:35.246 --> 15:40.149
Hector, I just cannot believe
our old apartment went up in flames.

15:40.751 --> 15:43.743
Y eah, there's been
a lot of changes since you've been gone.

15:45.857 --> 15:48.291
It's still nice to have you back.

15:49.193 --> 15:51.753
Well, look, I'll be downstairs.

15:53.397 --> 15:56.855
Y ou know what?
I never gave you kids a wedding present.

15:58.102 --> 16:00.798
Best of luck, huh?

16:07.278 --> 16:11.442
Y ou know, Aunt Viv, Uncle Phil, I used
to love coming out here to visit y'all.

16:11.983 --> 16:12.972
Hey, Ashley, check this out.

16:13.050 --> 16:16.144
This is where Aunt Viv
used to measure how tall we was getting.

16:16.320 --> 16:18.880
- Look, here's me.
- Will, there's you.

16:19.257 --> 16:21.157
Look, there's Carlton.

16:29.100 --> 16:33.730
Y ou know, Aunt Viv, Uncle Phil, there was
a lot of love shared in this room.

16:35.706 --> 16:38.174
Don't even think about kissing me.

16:51.122 --> 16:53.352
Hilary, time to set the table.

17:01.065 --> 17:04.364
Baby, why are you throwing your doll
in the garbage?

17:04.435 --> 17:08.234
Well, I tried flushing her
down the toilet, but the little creep floats.

17:09.173 --> 17:10.265
I want a new doll.

17:10.340 --> 17:13.002
Baby, it's all we can afford right now.

17:13.077 --> 17:14.942
With all the free legal aid
your daddy gives...

17:15.012 --> 17:16.843
we're barely covering expenses...

17:16.914 --> 17:21.714
but there are more important things in life
than fancy clothes and big houses.

17:21.886 --> 17:23.353
What have you been smoking?

17:26.790 --> 17:29.521
Y o, Uncle Phil,
how you going to play a nephew?

17:30.194 --> 17:31.786
On his behind, Will.

17:34.265 --> 17:37.325
That honey was about to invite me up
for some milk and cookies.

17:37.702 --> 17:40.330
That honey was old enough
to be your mother.

17:42.139 --> 17:44.630
Word up, and she was divorced, too.

17:47.044 --> 17:48.807
Parents just don't understand.

17:51.382 --> 17:54.044
Hey, big guy,
got time to read me a bedtime story?

17:54.118 --> 17:58.487
Sure, Carlton, what's it going to be?
<i>Cat /n The Hat</i> or <i>Curious George?</i>

17:58.556 --> 18:02.515
No, <i>The Wa// Street Journa/,</i>
the part where AMC goes belly up.

18:04.795 --> 18:06.729
Are you sure we're all related?

18:08.699 --> 18:11.668
Mom, Dad, I've been thinking it over...

18:11.869 --> 18:14.736
and I've decided what I want to be
when I grow up.

18:14.805 --> 18:15.965
What, tall?

18:19.477 --> 18:23.072
- That's nice, honey, what?
- President of the United States.

18:23.414 --> 18:25.644
Well, that would make me
very proud, Carlton.

18:25.716 --> 18:28.947
Imagine, my son,
the country's first black president.

18:29.887 --> 18:31.081
I'm black?

18:44.268 --> 18:45.462
Hello?

18:47.138 --> 18:50.972
One second, please.
Philip, it's Mr. Firth from the law firm.

18:55.179 --> 18:56.510
Hello, Mr. Firth?

18:57.982 --> 18:58.971
Y es.

18:59.750 --> 19:02.116
I would love to meet
with the other partners.

19:02.453 --> 19:05.115
Next Thursday is great. Thank you.

19:05.189 --> 19:06.656
Thank you very much.

19:07.792 --> 19:09.316
All right, hold it now.

19:09.694 --> 19:12.219
Don't want to get anybody's hopes up...

19:12.430 --> 19:15.297
but Mr. Firth wants me to come back
for a second interview.

19:17.435 --> 19:20.199
I'm rich! I'm rich!

19:21.372 --> 19:23.135
I'll pack our bags.

19:23.207 --> 19:26.040
Maybe we can get a place
close to the Reagans.

19:27.778 --> 19:30.338
Did I ever tell you folks
how much I like visiting?

19:32.683 --> 19:34.810
Hold on, now. Hold on.

19:35.019 --> 19:36.077
Now look...

19:36.220 --> 19:39.417
even if I do get this job, nothing changes.

19:40.091 --> 19:43.185
This is our home
and this community is a part of our family.

19:45.029 --> 19:46.894
And I'll never turn my back on it.

19:55.306 --> 19:57.536
We had some good times in this old place.

19:58.576 --> 20:00.009
We sure did, baby.

20:01.779 --> 20:03.269
Our roots are here.

20:04.014 --> 20:05.914
This is where we started our family.

20:06.150 --> 20:08.641
Man, I wonder if that
divorced lady still live here?

20:10.421 --> 20:13.686
She probably like 127 or something...

20:13.758 --> 20:16.226
y eah, and we made
some very good friends here.

20:17.094 --> 20:20.222
But we haven't fulfilled
our commitment to them or to this place.

20:22.166 --> 20:24.828
Look, you know, Uncle Phil,
I think I will come back...

20:24.902 --> 20:25.994
you know, next weekend.

20:26.070 --> 20:28.004
Hook up with my man Noah,
set up a schedule.

20:29.006 --> 20:33.272
Y es, I think I'll hook up with Simone
and make out a little schedule of my own.

20:37.815 --> 20:40.340
I'm going to go sign up for next week.

20:42.653 --> 20:44.883
So, the house will be empty next week?

20:46.791 --> 20:48.884
Great! I'm going to plan a party.

21:03.641 --> 21:06.542
I guess you're really disappointed in me,
huh, Vivian?

21:07.178 --> 21:09.669
- Why?
- 'Cause I sold out.

21:10.114 --> 21:11.979
Did everything I said I wouldn't do.

21:12.049 --> 21:13.573
Became a high-powered lawyer...

21:13.651 --> 21:16.119
bought that house in Bel-Air,
and never looked back.

21:16.854 --> 21:19.914
Philip, honey, you shouldn't feel guilty
about your success.

21:19.990 --> 21:21.651
Baby, nobody gave you anything.

21:21.725 --> 21:24.091
Y ou have worked hard for everything
you've got.

21:24.161 --> 21:27.153
Y ou've been generous
and you've contributed to a lot of causes.

21:27.231 --> 21:29.256
It takes more than just writing a check.

21:29.333 --> 21:32.234
I've lost myself, I've lost my fire,
my passion.

21:32.703 --> 21:35.467
Y ou're right, Vivian,
I have become dull and predictable.

21:36.140 --> 21:38.608
- Philip.
- I want to be the kind of man...

21:38.676 --> 21:42.544
you fell in love with. I want to be
open to risks, I want to take chances.

21:42.613 --> 21:46.071
Oh, Philip, do you mean it? Do you?

21:46.951 --> 21:48.680
I'm afraid it's too late.

21:49.653 --> 21:50.984
I've chased you away.

21:51.655 --> 21:53.418
Philip, what are you talking about?

21:54.124 --> 21:56.024
I know where you were yesterday.

21:57.094 --> 21:58.755
Y ou're having an affair.

22:00.397 --> 22:03.127
I don't blame you,
I'm just going to kill you.

22:07.304 --> 22:09.864
Oh, no, is that where you thought
I was yesterday?

22:09.940 --> 22:11.032
What?

22:11.809 --> 22:14.835
Y ou mean, you weren't with another man?

22:15.212 --> 22:18.375
- Of course not.
- Lucky for you.

22:22.186 --> 22:25.417
Philip, I was afraid to tell you
because I didn't think you could take it.

22:25.489 --> 22:28.822
- Y ou didn't think I could take it.
- No. But now I know you can.

22:28.893 --> 22:31.487
- Philip, I was at the doctor's yesterday.
- The doctor's!

22:32.696 --> 22:34.186
Philip, I'm pregnant!

22:47.444 --> 22:49.469
So you're not working out
of a little storefront anymore?

22:49.546 --> 22:51.639
Well, no, my office has gotten
a little bit bigger...

22:51.715 --> 22:54.479
and I only... And, it's pretty good.

22:54.551 --> 22:56.143
- Hold it!
- Oh, you don't say.

22:57.488 --> 22:59.217
- That's all right.
- Y eah.

22:59.957 --> 23:00.946
Stuttering.

23:06.797 --> 23:07.786
Bad word!
