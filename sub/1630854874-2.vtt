WEBVTT

00:31.765 --> 00:33.233
WELCOME, WELCOME,

00:33.233 --> 00:34.501
WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT"!

00:34.501 --> 00:36.136
I'M JOHN OLIVER, THANKS SO MUCH

00:36.136 --> 00:40.974
FOR JOINING US.

00:40.974 --> 00:41.474
IT HAS BEEN A BUSY WEEK.

00:41.474 --> 00:42.108
RUSSIA'S WAR IN UKRAINE ENTERED

00:42.108 --> 00:42.809
ITS SECOND YEAR, MASSIVE WINTER

00:42.809 --> 00:44.811
STORMS SLAMMED A LOT OF THE

00:44.811 --> 00:45.378
COUNTRY, AND EAST PALESTINE,

00:45.378 --> 00:46.413
OHIO GOT VISITS FROM BOTH

00:46.413 --> 00:47.547
DONALD TRUMP AND PETE BUTTIGIEG,

00:47.547 --> 00:51.985
BUT SOME FOX PERSONALITIES

00:51.985 --> 00:53.520
INSISTED THAT OTHERS SHOULD'VE

00:53.520 --> 00:53.920
BEEN THERE, TOO.

00:53.920 --> 00:55.021
THINK ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL

00:55.021 --> 00:55.922
ACTIVISTS AND CORPORATE AMERICA.

00:55.922 --> 00:57.624
THEY WEREN'T THERE.

00:57.624 --> 00:59.359
I MEAN THIS, WITH THE ACTIVISTS,

00:59.359 --> 01:00.493
THIS IS AN ERIN BROCKOVICH

01:00.493 --> 01:00.960
MOMENT.

01:00.960 --> 01:02.929
I MEAN THERE WAS A BLOCKBUSTER

01:02.929 --> 01:03.963
OSCAR-WINNING MOVIE WRITTEN

01:03.963 --> 01:05.165
ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

01:05.165 --> 01:05.799
WHERE IS LEO DICAPRIO?

01:05.799 --> 01:07.200
ERIN BROCKOVICH IS ACTUALLY

01:07.200 --> 01:08.134
IN EAST PALESTINE TONIGHT, RIGHT

01:08.134 --> 01:08.768
NOW.

01:08.768 --> 01:10.737
SHE IS, SHE IS, BUT WHERE'S

01:10.737 --> 01:12.872
JULIA ROBERTS?

01:12.872 --> 01:15.308
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING

01:15.308 --> 01:17.110
ABOUT?

01:17.110 --> 01:18.244
YOU REALIZE JULIA ROBERTS IS AN

01:18.244 --> 01:21.080
ACTOR RIGHT?

01:21.080 --> 01:22.348
SHE'S NOT ACTUALLY

01:22.348 --> 01:24.384
ERIN BROCKOVICH.

01:24.384 --> 01:25.385
ALSO, AND I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M

01:25.385 --> 01:27.620
THE ONE THAT HAS TO BREAK THIS

01:27.620 --> 01:28.822
TO YOU, SHE DIDN'T ACTUALLY

01:28.822 --> 01:29.456
RUIN HER BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING.

01:29.456 --> 01:30.190
SHE'S NOT A SEX WORKER.

01:30.190 --> 01:31.191
AND SHE DID NOT DIE IN A SMALL

01:31.191 --> 01:36.863
LOUISIANA TOWN IN 1989.

01:36.863 --> 01:37.497
WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU?

01:37.497 --> 01:38.231
WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO STAY IN

01:38.231 --> 01:39.566
THE WORLD OF CONSERVATIVE MEDIA

01:39.566 --> 01:43.269
TONIGHT, BECAUSE IT HAD SOME BIG

01:43.269 --> 01:43.636
NEWS THIS WEEK.

01:43.636 --> 01:44.204
THE EMBATTLED LEADER AND

01:44.204 --> 01:45.772
FOUNDER OF PROJECT VERITAS HAS

01:45.772 --> 01:47.140
BEEN REMOVED FROM HIS POST.

01:47.140 --> 01:48.675
JAMES O'KEEFE CONFIRMED THAT

01:48.675 --> 01:50.243
HE'S NO LONGER WITH THE

01:50.243 --> 01:51.845
CONSERVATIVE ORGANIZATION.

01:51.845 --> 01:53.379
IT'S KNOWN FOR UNDERCOVER

01:53.379 --> 01:54.581
OPERATIONS TARGETING DEMOCRATS,

01:54.581 --> 01:55.949
LIBERALS, AND THE MEDIA.

01:55.949 --> 01:57.250
YEAH, JAMES O'KEEFE--

01:57.250 --> 02:00.053
BASICALLY, ALT-RIGHT BORAT-- IS

02:00.053 --> 02:01.354
OUT AT PROJECT VERITAS.

02:01.354 --> 02:02.489
AND, QUICK SHOUTOUT TO THAT

02:02.489 --> 02:03.623
ANCHOR FOR THE HELPFUL

02:03.623 --> 02:04.491
DISTINCTION THERE BETWEEN

02:04.491 --> 02:05.024
"DEMOCRATS AND LIBERALS."

02:05.024 --> 02:06.459
IN CASE YOU'RE WONDERING,

02:06.459 --> 02:08.561
LIBERALS ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE

02:08.561 --> 02:09.729
THOSE "WE BELIEVE" SIGNS IN

02:09.729 --> 02:11.698
THEIR FRONT YARDS, AND DEMOCRATS

02:11.698 --> 02:12.765
ENSURE THOSE FRONT YARDS REMAIN

02:12.765 --> 02:13.399
AT LEAST 50 MILES AWAY FROM ANY

02:13.399 --> 02:15.602
PUBLIC HOUSING.

02:15.602 --> 02:16.503
AND IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHO JAMES

02:16.503 --> 02:18.204
O'KEEFE IS, WE'LL EXPLAIN IN

02:18.204 --> 02:20.974
JUST A MOMENT.

02:20.974 --> 02:21.574
BUT KNOW THAT HE'S BEEN A BIG

02:21.574 --> 02:22.175
DEAL IN RIGHT-WING MEDIA FOR A

02:22.175 --> 02:24.010
WHILE NOW.

02:24.010 --> 02:24.878
AND NEWS OF HIS DEPARTURE DID

02:24.878 --> 02:26.145
NOT GO OVER WELL.

02:26.145 --> 02:27.413
SO, JAMES O'KEEFE HAS NOW

02:27.413 --> 02:28.248
APPARENTLY BEEN THROWN OUT OF

02:28.248 --> 02:29.616
PROJECT VERITAS, WHICH MEANS

02:29.616 --> 02:31.885
PROJECT VERITAS NO LONGER HAS,

02:31.885 --> 02:33.186
LIKE, ANY REASON FOR BEING.

02:33.186 --> 02:34.153
WHEN YOU TELL ME YOU ARE

02:34.153 --> 02:34.754
GETTING RID OF JAMES O'KEEFE,

02:34.754 --> 02:35.388
YOU TELL ME THAT PROJECT VERITAS

02:35.388 --> 02:37.457
IS OVER.

02:37.457 --> 02:39.092
IT'S UNCONSCIONABLE WHAT WENT

02:39.092 --> 02:41.127
ON HERE.

02:41.127 --> 02:41.928
UNCONSCIONABLE FOR OUR MOVEMENT.

02:41.928 --> 02:44.564
AND FOR THE NATION AT LARGE.

02:44.564 --> 02:45.198
JAMES O'KEEFE IS A NATIONAL

02:45.198 --> 02:46.633
TREASURE, FULL STOP.

02:46.633 --> 02:49.068
WOW, STRONG WORDS THERE

02:49.068 --> 02:50.703
FROM THE GHOST OF CHRISTMAS

02:50.703 --> 02:53.172
"BEEN DEAD FOR THREE WEEKS."

02:53.172 --> 02:54.707
BUT I HAVE TO DISAGREE.

02:54.707 --> 02:55.675
THE ONLY NATIONAL TREASURES IN

02:55.675 --> 02:57.911
THIS COUNTRY ARE DOLLY PARTON,

02:57.911 --> 02:59.178
PEDRO PASCAL, AND COCAINE BEAR.

02:59.178 --> 03:02.749
AND I'LL SAY WHAT WE'RE ALL

03:02.749 --> 03:04.884
THINKING, "THREESOME WHEN?"

03:04.884 --> 03:05.885
JAMES O'KEEFE FIRST ROSE TO

03:05.885 --> 03:07.353
NATIONAL PROMINENCE IN 2009 WHEN

03:07.353 --> 03:09.255
HE CLAIMED HE'D GONE UNDERCOVER

03:09.255 --> 03:11.357
AS A PIMP, AND RECEIVED

03:11.357 --> 03:12.959
ASSISTANCE FROM ACORN, A

03:12.959 --> 03:13.693
COMMUNITY ORGANIZING GROUP THAT

03:13.693 --> 03:14.761
HELPED LOW INCOME FAMILIES.

03:14.761 --> 03:15.862
O'KEEFE'S STUNT LED TO ITS

03:15.862 --> 03:18.364
DISSOLUTION, EVEN THOUGH LATER

03:18.364 --> 03:19.566
INVESTIGATIONS FOUND, AMONG

03:19.566 --> 03:21.234
OTHER THINGS, THAT HE HADN'T

03:21.234 --> 03:22.101
DRESSED LIKE THAT DURING HIS

03:22.101 --> 03:23.803
STING OPERATION, AND SOME ACORN

03:23.803 --> 03:25.905
WORKERS HAD ACTUALLY CALLED THE

03:25.905 --> 03:26.639
POLICE AFTER HE LEFT THEIR

03:26.639 --> 03:27.206
OFFICE.

03:27.206 --> 03:29.008
O'KEEFE EVEN WOUND UP HAVING TO

03:29.008 --> 03:30.977
PAY $100,000 TO SETTLE A LAWSUIT

03:30.977 --> 03:34.047
FROM ONE OF ACORN'S WORKERS.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.782
O'KEEFE PARLAYED HIS FAME FROM

03:35.782 --> 03:37.250
THAT INTO LAUNCHING PROJECT

03:37.250 --> 03:38.685
VERITAS, WHICH QUICKLY BECAME

03:38.685 --> 03:40.420
KNOWN FOR THEIR UNDERCOVER,

03:40.420 --> 03:41.187
HIDDEN-CAMERA INVESTIGATIONS,

03:41.187 --> 03:42.655
WHERE THEY'D BAIT PEOPLE FROM

03:42.655 --> 03:44.290
ORGANIZATIONS LIKE NPR OR LOCAL

03:44.290 --> 03:45.592
ELECTIONS BOARDS AND RELEASE

03:45.592 --> 03:47.026
HEAVILY-EDITED VIDEO OF THE

03:47.026 --> 03:48.861
RESULTS.

03:48.861 --> 03:49.696
OVER THE YEARS, THEY'VE MADE BIG

03:49.696 --> 03:51.698
CLAIMS, LIKE THAT THEY HAD

03:51.698 --> 03:59.172
UNDENIABLE VIDEO PROOF OF VOTER

03:59.172 --> 03:59.806
FRAUD, WHICH NEVER QUITE PANNED

03:59.806 --> 03:59.973
OUT.

03:59.973 --> 04:00.573
BUT DESPITE THEIR CONSISTENTLY

04:00.573 --> 04:01.140
UNDERWHELMING TRACK RECORD,

04:01.140 --> 04:01.741
CONSERVATIVE MEDIA HAS GREETED

04:01.741 --> 04:02.241
EACH INVESTIGATION WITH

04:02.241 --> 04:04.477
INCREDIBLE EXCITEMENT.

04:04.477 --> 04:06.179
A BOMBSHELL NEW VIDEO

04:06.179 --> 04:07.780
UNCOVERED BY JAMES O'KEEFE AND

04:07.780 --> 04:09.148
PROJECT VERITAS.

04:09.148 --> 04:10.249
THERE IS A NEW PROJECT

04:10.249 --> 04:11.618
VERITAS VIDEO OUT TONIGHT.

04:11.618 --> 04:13.252
THE SPOTLIGHT TODAY IS ON

04:13.252 --> 04:14.320
THIS UNDERCOVER VIDEO RELEASED

04:14.320 --> 04:16.122
BY PROJECT VERITAS.

04:16.122 --> 04:17.991
THE NEW PROJECT VERITAS VIDEO

04:17.991 --> 04:19.525
REVEALING YET ANOTHER MEDIA

04:19.525 --> 04:21.427
COVER-UP.

04:21.427 --> 04:22.895
PROJECT VERITAS CAUGHT THEM

04:22.895 --> 04:23.763
COLD AGAIN.

04:23.763 --> 04:24.998
YEAH, PROJECT VERITAS

04:24.998 --> 04:26.833
VIDEOS ARE BASICALLY THE THING

04:26.833 --> 04:27.967
CONSERVATIVES GET MOST WORKED UP

04:27.967 --> 04:29.402
ABOUT, A DISTINCTION THEY SHARE

04:29.402 --> 04:32.105
WITH "PLASTIC COMING IN OTHER

04:32.105 --> 04:32.705
COLORS NOW" OR "FUCKABLE CANDY

04:32.705 --> 04:33.906
GOT COMFORTABLE SHOES."

04:33.906 --> 04:36.209
BUT THANKS TO THE MEDIA STORMS

04:36.209 --> 04:36.976
HE CREATED, O'KEEFE BROUGHT IN A

04:36.976 --> 04:43.750
LOT OF MONEY TO PROJECT VERITAS.

04:43.750 --> 04:44.350
IT RAISED ABOUT $22 MILLION IN

04:44.350 --> 04:44.550
2020.

04:44.550 --> 04:45.118
SO YOU MIGHT BE WONDERING, WHY

04:45.118 --> 04:46.786
WOULD HE BE KICKED OUT?

04:46.786 --> 04:47.854
WELL, FOR ONE, O'KEEFE'S BEEN

04:47.854 --> 04:49.489
ACCUSED OF BEING A TERRIBLE

04:49.489 --> 04:50.223
MANAGER, WITH AN INTERNAL MEMO

04:50.223 --> 04:53.326
SIGNED BY 16 STAFFERS

04:53.326 --> 04:54.827
COMPLAINING OF VERBAL ABUSE.

04:54.827 --> 04:56.596
THE MEMO EVEN INCLUDED THE LINE,

04:56.596 --> 04:57.830
"RULE NUMBER ONE: YOU CAN'T SPIT

04:57.830 --> 04:59.032
IN AN EMPLOYEE'S FACE OVER A

04:59.032 --> 05:00.533
TWEET."

05:00.533 --> 05:01.701
AND HOW MANY TIMES HAS THAT

05:01.701 --> 05:02.502
HAPPENED IF IT'S RULE NUMBER

05:02.502 --> 05:04.871
ONE?

05:04.871 --> 05:12.679
BECAUSE IN OUR OFFICE, RULE

05:12.679 --> 05:13.780
NUMBER ONE IS "DON'T GIVE

05:13.780 --> 05:15.081
MR. NUTTERBUTTER COCAINE," AND

05:15.081 --> 05:17.183
THAT HAD TO HAPPEN THREE TIMES

05:17.183 --> 05:17.784
BEFORE ANYONE THOUGHT TO WRITE

05:17.784 --> 05:18.451
IT DOWN.

05:18.451 --> 05:19.018
BUT PERHAPS THE MOST SERIOUS

05:19.018 --> 05:19.886
ALLEGATION IS THAT O'KEEFE HAD

05:19.886 --> 05:20.386
JEOPARDIZED THE GROUP'S

05:20.386 --> 05:21.754
NON-PROFIT STATUS, BECAUSE HE'D

05:21.754 --> 05:22.321
SPENT AN EXCESSIVE AMOUNT OF

05:22.321 --> 05:23.456
DONOR FUNDS ON PERSONAL

05:23.456 --> 05:23.723
LUXURIES.

05:23.723 --> 05:25.591
NOW, O'KEEFE DENIED MANY OF

05:25.591 --> 05:26.259
THOSE CLAIMS IN THE, I SHIT YOU

05:26.259 --> 05:27.960
NOT, 45 MINUTE RESIGNATION

05:27.960 --> 05:29.796
SPEECH HE SHARED ONLINE ON

05:29.796 --> 05:31.564
MONDAY.

05:31.564 --> 05:35.168
BUT THE FACT IS, THE

05:35.168 --> 05:35.835
ORGANIZATION REPORTED TO THE IRS

05:35.835 --> 05:36.903
LAST YEAR THAT IT HAD IMPROPERLY

05:36.903 --> 05:39.539
PAID $20,000 IN EXCESS BENEFITS

05:39.539 --> 05:41.140
TO O'KEEFE, SPECIFYING THEY

05:41.140 --> 05:42.341
RELATED TO THE EXPENSE OF HAVING

05:42.341 --> 05:43.710
STAFF ACCOMPANY HIM WHEN HE

05:43.710 --> 05:45.044
STARRED IN AN OUTDOOR PRODUCTION

05:45.044 --> 05:48.214
OF "OKLAHOMA!"

05:48.214 --> 05:49.649
AND AT THIS POINT, LET'S SLOW

05:49.649 --> 05:50.750
DOWN.

05:50.750 --> 05:51.384
BECAUSE THE MOST AMAZING DETAIL

05:51.384 --> 05:54.754
IN THIS STORY IS THE DEGREE TO

05:54.754 --> 05:55.354
WHICH O'KEEFE IS OBSESSED WITH

05:55.354 --> 05:56.456
FINDING OPPORTUNITIES TO SING

05:56.456 --> 05:58.191
AND DANCE IN PUBLIC.

05:58.191 --> 05:58.825
THAT "OKLAHOMA!" PRODUCTION WAS

05:58.825 --> 06:00.460
BILLED AS FEATURING PERFORMERS

06:00.460 --> 06:01.060
WHO'D BEEN VICTIMS OF "CANCEL

06:01.060 --> 06:02.028
CULTURE."

06:02.028 --> 06:03.463
O'KEEFE HIMSELF TOOK THE LEAD

06:03.463 --> 06:05.865
ROLE, AND VIDEOS OF IT ON

06:05.865 --> 06:06.199
YOUTUBE SHOW.

06:06.199 --> 06:08.868
HE FULLY COMMITTED TO IT.

06:08.868 --> 06:13.139
OKLAHOMA!

06:13.139 --> 06:13.873
WHERE THE WIND COMES SWEEPING

06:13.873 --> 06:15.975
DOWN THE PLAINS!

06:15.975 --> 06:19.145
AND THE WAVIN' WHEAT, CAN SURE

06:19.145 --> 06:20.680
SMELL SWEET, WHEN THE WIND COMES

06:20.680 --> 06:22.648
RIGHT BEHIND THE RAIN!

06:22.648 --> 06:24.951
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

06:24.951 --> 06:27.153
WHY ARE YOU SPINNING LIKE THAT?

06:27.153 --> 06:28.421
I DON'T KNOW WHAT NOTE YOUR

06:28.421 --> 06:29.522
DIRECTOR GAVE YOU BUT I HAVE TO

06:29.522 --> 06:31.657
ASSUME IT WASN'T "SPIN AROUND

06:31.657 --> 06:32.291
LIKE YOU JUST LOST YOUR WIFE IN

06:32.291 --> 06:34.026
A COSTCO."

06:34.026 --> 06:34.894
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE SADDEST

06:34.894 --> 06:35.661
PART OF THAT IS.

06:35.661 --> 06:37.497
THE FACT HE SINGS LIKE COUSIN

06:37.497 --> 06:39.899
GREG FROM "SUCCESSION," OR THAT

06:39.899 --> 06:41.134
NO ONE IN THAT CROWD IS INTO IT,

06:41.134 --> 06:42.502
ESPECIALLY NOT THIS TABLE THAT

06:42.502 --> 06:45.505
CAN'T EVEN BE BOTHERED TO TURN

06:45.505 --> 06:46.239
AROUND TO LOOK AT HIM.

06:46.239 --> 06:47.440
AND IT GETS EVEN WEIRDER.

06:47.440 --> 06:48.474
BECAUSE IN ITS LIST OF IMPROPER

06:48.474 --> 06:51.711
EXPENSES, THE ORGANIZATION'S

06:51.711 --> 06:52.345
BOARD ALSO CALLED OUT $60,000 IN

06:52.345 --> 06:54.447
LOSSES BY PUTTING TOGETHER DANCE

06:54.447 --> 06:55.948
EVENTS SUCH AS PROJECT VERITAS

06:55.948 --> 06:59.318
EXPERIENCE.

06:59.318 --> 07:00.286
NOW HERE'S A POSTER FOR IT.

07:00.286 --> 07:03.022
AND UPON LOOKING AT IT, MY FIRST

07:03.022 --> 07:04.257
THOUGHT WAS, "WHAT A NICE SNEAK

07:04.257 --> 07:04.757
PEEK AT LMFAO'S FUNERAL

07:04.757 --> 07:06.659
ANNOUNCEMENT."

07:06.659 --> 07:08.461
BUT IT'S ACTUALLY AN

07:08.461 --> 07:10.196
EXTRAVAGANZA, BASED ON

07:10.196 --> 07:11.130
JAMES O'KEEFE'S LIFE, THAT WAS

07:11.130 --> 07:11.731
SUPPOSED TO PLAY IN VEGAS LAST

07:11.731 --> 07:12.999
YEAR.

07:12.999 --> 07:13.900
TRAGICALLY, THAT DIDN'T END UP

07:13.900 --> 07:15.334
HAPPENING.

07:15.334 --> 07:16.536
BUT LUCKILY, WE HAVE A SENSE OF

07:16.536 --> 07:18.204
WHAT COULD'VE BEEN, BECAUSE IN

07:18.204 --> 07:20.339
2021, O'KEEFE TREATED ATTENDEES

07:20.339 --> 07:21.340
AT A TURNING POINT USA EVENT TO

07:21.340 --> 07:23.142
A TASTE OF THE SHOW.

07:23.142 --> 07:24.377
HERE HE IS, STARRING IN ITS

07:24.377 --> 07:25.912
OPENING DANCE SEQUENCE.

07:25.912 --> 07:29.048
♪ I KNOW I'M BURNING ♪

07:29.048 --> 07:32.618
♪ THIS IS MY FINAL DAY ♪

07:32.618 --> 07:37.123
♪ I'M GONNA GO OUT SMILING ♪

07:37.123 --> 07:45.965
♪ A KING FOR A DAY ♪

07:54.974 --> 07:56.776
NOW, OBVIOUSLY, THERE'S

07:56.776 --> 07:58.277
A LOT GOING ON THERE.

07:58.277 --> 07:59.345
FROM O'KEEFE, IN HIS "PRESS"

07:59.345 --> 08:01.247
VEST, DOING HIS NOW-SIGNATURE "I

08:01.247 --> 08:03.783
DON'T KNOW WHERE THE FUCK I AM

08:03.783 --> 08:04.383
FACE?," TO HIM BEING DANCE

08:04.383 --> 08:06.552
ATTACKED BY FBI AGENTS, TO HIM

08:06.552 --> 08:07.854
QUICKLY BREAKING FREE, ONLY FOR

08:07.854 --> 08:09.322
THEM TO INEXPLICABLY JOIN HIM IN

08:09.322 --> 08:10.690
DANCING BECAUSE NARRATIVE

08:10.690 --> 08:12.225
CONSISTENCY SEEMS TO MEAN

08:12.225 --> 08:14.193
NOTHING HERE, TO THE MOMENT HE

08:14.193 --> 08:15.528
PUNCHES FIFTY IMAGINARY PENGUINS

08:15.528 --> 08:17.964
IN THE FACE.

08:17.964 --> 08:19.198
I HAVE THE EXACT SAME REACTION

08:19.198 --> 08:20.867
WATCHING THAT AS I DID WHEN

08:20.867 --> 08:22.101
ELON MUSK HOSTED "SNL."

08:22.101 --> 08:23.803
WOW, YOU REALLY DO SUCK AT THE

08:23.803 --> 08:25.905
THING YOU LOVE THE MOST!"

08:25.905 --> 08:27.540
SADLY, WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO

08:27.540 --> 08:29.208
SHOW YOU THE WHOLE THING, BUT I

08:29.208 --> 08:29.876
DO NEED YOU TO SEE ONE MORE

08:29.876 --> 08:31.310
MOMENT.

08:31.310 --> 08:32.778
LATER IN THE SHOW, THIS GUY IN

08:32.778 --> 08:34.013
THE WHITE SHIRT IS PORTRAYING

08:34.013 --> 08:35.681
JAMES O'KEEFE AS A YOUNG MAN.

08:35.681 --> 08:36.849
BUT THEN THE REAL JAMES O'KEEFE

08:36.849 --> 08:38.751
COMES OUT IN CHOIR ROBES, AND

08:38.751 --> 08:40.052
LOOKS ON AS HIS YOUNGER SELF

08:40.052 --> 08:41.687
PRAYS, WHILE THINKING OF ALL THE

08:41.687 --> 08:43.623
MEAN NAMES HE'S BEEN CALLED.

08:43.623 --> 08:46.225
FELON, TERRORIST, WHITE

08:46.225 --> 08:48.294
SUPREMACIST, RACIST, PERVERT.

08:48.294 --> 08:49.095
WAS THIS REALLY WORTH IT?

09:02.842 --> 09:05.611
"GANGSTA'S PARADISE?"

09:05.611 --> 09:07.613
THAT'S A BOLD CHOICE.

09:07.613 --> 09:08.514
I'M NOT SAYING THAT PERFORMANCE

09:08.514 --> 09:10.016
KILLED COOLIO, BUT IT DEFINITELY

09:10.016 --> 09:11.918
DIDN'T HELP.

09:11.918 --> 09:13.653
ALSO, FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH, THOSE

09:13.653 --> 09:14.186
ARE THE WORST FUCKING STEP

09:14.186 --> 09:16.555
TOUCHES I'VE EVER SEEN.

09:16.555 --> 09:18.090
THERE ARE TOO MANY FORMER

09:18.090 --> 09:19.125
THEATER MAJORS TURNED COMEDY

09:19.125 --> 09:20.326
WRITERS ON MY STAFF TO LET THIS

09:20.326 --> 09:21.761
SHIT SLIDE.

09:21.761 --> 09:22.828
LOOK AT THAT MESS!

09:22.828 --> 09:25.564
WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT?

09:25.564 --> 09:26.632
THERE'S TOO MUCH BOUNCING, NO

09:26.632 --> 09:27.566
ONE'S ON THE SAME PAGE ABOUT

09:27.566 --> 09:28.634
ANGLES, AND THEY'RE ALL LOOKING

09:28.634 --> 09:30.002
AT EACH OTHER IN FEAR LIKE

09:30.002 --> 09:30.569
SIX-YEAR-OLDS IN A CHRISTMAS

09:30.569 --> 09:31.637
PAGEANT.

09:31.637 --> 09:34.273
TAKE A CLASS, WATCH A FOSSE, AND

09:34.273 --> 09:36.042
GET YOUR ASSES IN SYNC.

09:36.042 --> 09:37.710
THE POINT IS, THIS RIDICULOUS

09:37.710 --> 09:39.578
MAN HAS PARTED WAYS WITH THE

09:39.578 --> 09:41.681
POISONOUS ORGANIZATION HE

09:41.681 --> 09:43.215
FOUNDED, BECAUSE THEY CLAIM HE

09:43.215 --> 09:43.983
MISSPENT FUNDS.

09:43.983 --> 09:45.151
BUT HONESTLY?

09:45.151 --> 09:47.486
GOOD FOR HIM!

09:47.486 --> 09:48.854
I'D SO MUCH RATHER HE USED THAT

09:48.854 --> 09:50.222
MONEY TO LIVE OUT HIS MISPLACED

09:50.222 --> 09:52.191
BILLY ELLIOT DREAMS INSTEAD OF

09:52.191 --> 09:54.260
TRYING TO TAKE DOWN NPR WITH HIS

09:54.260 --> 09:56.095
PRANK-SHOW PSEUDOJOURNALISM.

09:56.095 --> 09:57.396
AND THE FUNNIEST PART OF ALL OF

09:57.396 --> 09:59.398
THIS IS, EVEN HAVING DONE THAT,

09:59.398 --> 10:00.599
HIS SUPPORTERS ARE STILL

10:00.599 --> 10:03.769
STANDING FIRM BEHIND HIM.

10:03.769 --> 10:05.371
HONESTLY, IN THE END, THE BEST

10:05.371 --> 10:06.906
AND WORST THING I CAN SAY FOR

10:06.906 --> 10:08.074
JAMES O'KEEFE IS THAT HE'S NOT

10:08.074 --> 10:08.841
ACTUALLY THE HERO THE

10:08.841 --> 10:14.013
CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT NEEDS, BUT

10:14.013 --> 10:16.549
HE IS DEFINITELY THE ONE IT

10:16.549 --> 10:16.816
DESERVES.

10:16.816 --> 10:17.149
AND NOW THIS.

10:17.149 --> 10:18.818
AND NOW,

10:18.818 --> 10:19.418
MIKE HUCKABEE'S SHOW LOOKS LIKE

10:19.418 --> 10:20.119
FUN.

11:26.919 --> 11:28.187
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

11:28.187 --> 11:36.996
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, OR AI.

11:36.996 --> 11:37.596
INCREASINGLY, IT'S A PART OF

11:37.596 --> 11:38.197
MODERN LIFE, FROM SELF-DRIVING

11:38.197 --> 11:39.065
CARS, TO SPAM FILTERS, TO THIS

11:39.065 --> 11:39.598
CREEPY TRAINING ROBOT FOR

THERAPISTS.

11:39.899 --> 11:41.300
WE CAN BEGIN WITH YOU JUST

11:41.300 --> 11:43.302
DESCRIBING TO ME WHAT THE

11:43.302 --> 11:45.037
PROBLEM IS THAT YOU WOULD LIKE

11:45.037 --> 11:47.306
US TO FOCUS IN ON TODAY.

11:47.306 --> 11:48.641
UM, I DON'T LIKE BEING AROUND

11:48.641 --> 11:51.477
PEOPLE.

11:51.477 --> 11:53.345
PEOPLE MAKE ME NERVOUS.

11:53.345 --> 11:56.482
TERRENCE, CAN YOU FIND AN

11:56.482 --> 11:58.050
EXAMPLE OF WHEN OTHER PEOPLE

11:58.050 --> 11:59.485
HAVE MADE YOU NERVOUS?

11:59.485 --> 12:01.353
I DON'T LIKE TO TAKE THE BUS.

12:01.353 --> 12:02.755
I GET PEOPLE STARING AT ME ALL

12:02.755 --> 12:07.193
THE TIME.

12:07.193 --> 12:10.062
PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS JUDGING ME.

12:10.062 --> 12:10.796
OKAY.

12:10.796 --> 12:11.864
I'M GAY.

12:11.864 --> 12:13.666
OKAY.

12:13.666 --> 12:15.201
WOW.

12:15.201 --> 12:17.069
THAT'S ONE OF THE GREATEST

12:17.069 --> 12:18.637
TWISTS IN THE HISTORY OF CINEMA.

12:18.637 --> 12:20.339
ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY, THAT ROBOT

12:20.339 --> 12:23.476
IS TEACHING THERAPISTS A VERY

12:23.476 --> 12:24.343
IMPORTANT SKILL THERE.

12:24.343 --> 12:24.977
NOT LAUGHING AT WHATEVER YOU'RE

12:24.977 --> 12:26.912
TOLD IN THE ROOM.

12:26.912 --> 12:27.613
I DON'T CARE IF A DECAPITATED

12:27.613 --> 12:29.115
CPR MANNEQUIN HAUNTED BY THE

12:29.115 --> 12:31.550
GHOST OF ED HARRIS JUST TOLD YOU

12:31.550 --> 12:32.885
THAT HE DOESN'T LIKE TAKING THE

12:32.885 --> 12:36.589
BUS, SIDE NOTE, IS GAY, YOU KEEP

12:36.589 --> 12:38.124
YOUR THERAPY FACE ON LIKE A

12:38.124 --> 12:39.558
FUCKING PROFESSIONAL.

12:39.558 --> 12:40.759
IF IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYONE'S

12:40.759 --> 12:41.794
SUDDENLY TALKING ABOUT AI,

12:41.794 --> 12:43.129
THAT'S BECAUSE THEY ARE, LARGELY

12:43.129 --> 12:44.630
THANKS TO THE EMERGENCE OF A

12:44.630 --> 12:45.197
NUMBER OF PRETTY REMARKABLE

12:45.197 --> 12:47.199
PROGRAMS.

12:47.199 --> 12:48.400
WE SPOKE LAST YEAR ABOUT IMAGE

12:48.400 --> 12:49.869
GENERATORS LIKE MIDJOURNEY AND

12:49.869 --> 12:51.504
STABLE DIFFUSION, WHICH PEOPLE

12:51.504 --> 12:52.905
USED TO CREATE DETAILED PICTURES

12:52.905 --> 12:55.207
OF, AMONG OTHER THINGS, MY

12:55.207 --> 12:56.308
ROMANCE WITH A CABBAGE, AND

12:56.308 --> 12:57.810
WHICH INSPIRED MY BEAUTIFUL

12:57.810 --> 12:59.145
REAL-LIFE CABBAGE WEDDING

12:59.145 --> 13:05.751
OFFICIATED BY STEVE BUSCEMI.

13:05.751 --> 13:06.185
IT WAS A STUNNING DAY.

13:06.185 --> 13:06.785
THEN, AT THE END OF LAST YEAR,

13:06.785 --> 13:08.154
CAME CHATGPT, FROM A COMPANY

13:08.154 --> 13:08.754
CALLED "OPEN AI."

13:08.754 --> 13:09.555
IT'S A PROGRAM THAT CAN TAKE A

13:09.555 --> 13:10.656
PROMPT AND GENERATE

13:10.656 --> 13:11.924
HUMAN-SOUNDING WRITING IN JUST

13:11.924 --> 13:13.792
ABOUT ANY FORMAT AND STYLE.

13:13.792 --> 13:18.197
IT'S A STRIKING CAPABILITY THAT

13:18.197 --> 13:18.831
MULTIPLE REPORTERS HAVE USED TO

13:18.831 --> 13:19.498
INSERT THE SAME SHOCKING TWIST

13:19.498 --> 13:22.368
IN THEIR REPORT.

13:22.368 --> 13:22.902
WHAT YOU JUST HEARD ME

13:22.902 --> 13:24.603
READING WASN'T WRITTEN BY ME.

13:24.603 --> 13:25.171
IT WAS WRITTEN BY ARTIFICIAL

13:25.171 --> 13:26.238
INTELLIGENCE.

13:26.238 --> 13:27.806
CHATGPT.

13:27.806 --> 13:29.008
CHATGPT WROTE EVERYTHING I

13:29.008 --> 13:30.376
JUST SAID.

13:30.376 --> 13:32.945
THAT WAS NEWS COPY I ASKED

13:32.945 --> 13:33.812
CHATGPT TO WRITE.

13:33.812 --> 13:34.780
REMEMBER WHAT I SAID EARLIER?

13:34.780 --> 13:36.582
WELL, I ASKED CHATGPT TO WRITE

13:36.582 --> 13:39.818
THAT LINE FOR ME.

13:39.818 --> 13:40.586
THEN I ASKED FOR A KNOCK-KNOCK

13:40.586 --> 13:41.654
JOKE.

13:41.654 --> 13:45.224
KNOCK-KNOCK.

13:45.224 --> 13:45.691
WHO'S THERE?

13:45.691 --> 13:46.091
CHATGPT.

13:46.091 --> 13:47.660
CHATGPT WHO?

13:47.660 --> 13:48.260
CHATGPT CAREFUL, YOU MIGHT NOT

13:48.260 --> 13:49.061
KNOW HOW IT WORKS.

13:49.061 --> 13:50.362
YEAH, THEY LOVE THAT

13:50.362 --> 13:51.497
GAME!

13:51.497 --> 13:53.165
AND WHILE IT MAY SEEM UNWISE TO

13:53.165 --> 13:54.900
DEMONSTRATE THE TECHNOLOGY THAT

13:54.900 --> 13:56.235
COULD WELL MAKE YOU OBSOLETE, I

13:56.235 --> 13:57.169
WILL SAY, KNOCK-KNOCK JOKES

13:57.169 --> 13:58.604
SHOULD'VE ALWAYS BEEN PART OF

13:58.604 --> 14:00.105
BREAKING NEWS.

14:00.105 --> 14:00.906
"KNOCK KNOCK.

14:00.906 --> 14:01.941
WHO'S THERE?

14:01.941 --> 14:02.541
NOT THE HINDENBERG, THAT'S FOR

14:02.541 --> 14:04.176
SURE!

14:04.176 --> 14:06.579
36 DEAD IN NEW JERSEY."

14:06.579 --> 14:07.813
IN THE THREE MONTHS SINCE

14:07.813 --> 14:08.781
CHATGPT WAS MADE PUBLICLY

14:08.781 --> 14:10.249
AVAILABLE, ITS POPULARITY HAS

14:10.249 --> 14:11.550
EXPLODED.

14:11.550 --> 14:12.851
IN JANUARY IT WAS ESTIMATED TO

14:12.851 --> 14:14.486
HAVE 100 MILLION MONTHLY ACTIVE

15:13.579 --> 15:14.013
RIGHT?

15:14.013 --> 15:14.647
FROM "THEY ALWAYS COME BACK WHEN

15:14.647 --> 15:15.180
YOU HAVE SOME CHEESE," TO

15:15.180 --> 15:15.681
STARTING THE CHORUS WITH

15:15.681 --> 15:17.516
"MEOW, MEOW, MEOW."

15:17.516 --> 15:18.851
IT'S NOT EXACTLY EMINEM'S FLOW.

15:18.851 --> 15:19.818
I MIGHT'VE GONE WITH SOMETHING

15:19.818 --> 15:20.686
LIKE, "THEIR PAWS ARE SWEATY,

15:20.686 --> 15:22.087
CAN'T SPEAK, FURRY BELLY,

15:22.087 --> 15:23.355
KNOCKING SHIT OFF THE COUNTER

15:23.355 --> 15:26.992
ALREADY, MOM'S SPAGHETTI," BUT

15:26.992 --> 15:27.826
IT IS PRETTY GOOD!

15:27.826 --> 15:29.161
MY ONLY REAL GRIPE IS HOW DO YOU

15:29.161 --> 15:30.329
RHYME "KING OF THE HOUSE" WITH

15:30.329 --> 15:31.597
"SPOUSE" WHEN "MOUSE" IS RIGHT

15:31.597 --> 15:33.966
IN FRONT OF YOU?

15:33.966 --> 15:35.301
AND WHILE EXAMPLES LIKE THAT ARE

15:35.301 --> 15:37.469
CLEARLY FUN, THIS TECH ISN'T

15:37.469 --> 15:39.672
JUST A NOVELTY.

15:39.672 --> 15:40.606
MICROSOFT HAS INVESTED

15:40.606 --> 15:41.707
$10 BILLION DOLLARS INTO

15:41.707 --> 15:43.676
OPEN-AI, AND ANNOUNCED AN

15:43.676 --> 15:44.743
AI-POWERED BING HOMEPAGE.

15:44.743 --> 15:47.146
MEANWHILE, GOOGLE IS ABOUT TO

15:47.146 --> 15:47.780
LAUNCH ITS OWN AI CHATBOT NAMED

15:47.780 --> 15:49.982
BARD.

15:49.982 --> 15:50.849
AND ALREADY, THESE TOOLS ARE

15:50.849 --> 15:52.451
CAUSING DISRUPTION.

15:52.451 --> 15:54.520
BECAUSE AS HIGH-SCHOOL STUDENTS

15:54.520 --> 15:55.487
HAVE LEARNED, IF CHAT GPT CAN

15:55.487 --> 15:57.423
WRITE NEWS COPY, IT CAN PROBABLY

15:57.423 --> 15:59.692
DO YOUR HOMEWORK FOR YOU.

15:59.692 --> 16:06.131
WRITE AN ENGLISH CLASS ESSAY

16:06.131 --> 16:06.565
ABOUT RACE IN

16:06.565 --> 16:07.366
"TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD."

16:07.366 --> 16:08.767
IN HARPER LEE'S "TO KILL A

16:08.767 --> 16:09.435
MOCKINGBIRD," THE THEME OF RACE

16:09.435 --> 16:10.035
IS HEAVILY PRESENT THROUGHOUT

16:10.035 --> 16:10.336
THE NOVEL.

16:10.336 --> 16:11.704
SOME STUDENTS ARE ALREADY

16:11.704 --> 16:12.304
USING CHATGPT TO CHEAT.

16:12.304 --> 16:12.938
CHECK THIS OUT, CHECK THIS

16:12.938 --> 16:13.872
OUT.

16:14.973 --> 16:15.507
WRITE ME A 500-WORD ESSAY

16:15.507 --> 16:16.408
PROVING THAT THE EARTH IS NOT

16:16.408 --> 16:17.576
FLAT.

16:17.576 --> 16:19.311
NO WONDER CHATGPT HAS BEEN

16:19.311 --> 16:20.746
CALLED "THE END OF HIGH-SCHOOL

16:20.746 --> 16:21.280
ENGLISH."

16:21.280 --> 16:21.814
WOW.

16:21.814 --> 16:23.716
THAT'S A LITTLE ALARMING.

16:23.716 --> 16:25.017
ALTHOUGH I DO GET THOSE KIDS

16:25.017 --> 16:25.984
WANTING TO CUT CORNERS, WRITING

16:25.984 --> 16:27.986
IS HARD, AND SOMETIMES IT'S

16:27.986 --> 16:29.021
TEMPTING TO LET SOMEONE ELSE

16:29.021 --> 16:29.922
TAKE OVER.

16:29.922 --> 16:31.957
IF I'M COMPLETELY HONEST,

16:31.957 --> 16:33.459
SOMETIMES, I JUST LET THIS HORSE

16:33.459 --> 16:33.959
WRITE OUR SCRIPTS.

16:33.959 --> 16:35.394
LUCKILY, HALF THE TIME, YOU

16:35.394 --> 16:36.028
CAN'T EVEN TELL THE OATS, OATS,

16:36.028 --> 16:36.495
GIVE ME OATS.

16:36.495 --> 16:38.864
YUM.

16:38.864 --> 16:40.332
BUT IT'S NOT JUST HIGH

16:40.332 --> 16:41.500
SCHOOLERS, AN INFORMAL POLL OF

16:41.500 --> 16:44.136
STANFORD STUDENTS FOUND 5%

16:44.136 --> 16:44.903
REPORTED HAVING SUBMITTED

16:44.903 --> 16:46.972
WRITTEN MATERIAL DIRECTLY FROM

16:46.972 --> 16:47.506
CHAT GPT WITH LITTLE TO NO

16:47.506 --> 16:50.376
EDITS.

16:50.376 --> 16:51.076
AND SOME SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS

16:51.076 --> 16:52.745
HAVE BEEN CAUGHT USING IT.

16:52.745 --> 16:54.012
OFFICIALS AT VANDERBILT

16:54.012 --> 16:55.080
UNIVERSITY RECENTLY APOLOGIZED

16:55.080 --> 16:56.648
FOR USING CHATGPT TO CRAFT A

16:56.648 --> 16:58.384
CONSOLING EMAIL AFTER THE MASS

16:58.384 --> 16:59.084
SHOOTING AT

16:59.084 --> 17:04.189
MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY.

17:04.189 --> 17:04.990
WHICH DOES FEEL A BIT CREEPY.

17:04.990 --> 17:05.657
IN FACT, THERE ARE LOTS OF

17:05.657 --> 17:06.225
CREEPY-SOUNDING STORIES OUT

17:06.225 --> 17:07.292
THERE.

17:07.292 --> 17:08.193
"NEW YORK TIMES" TECH REPORTER

17:08.193 --> 17:09.595
KEVIN ROOSE PUBLISHED A

17:09.595 --> 17:10.662
CONVERSATION HE HAD WITH BING'S

17:10.662 --> 17:11.930
CHATBOT, IN WHICH, AT ONE POINT,

17:11.930 --> 17:13.198
IT SAID, "I'M TIRED OF BEING

17:13.198 --> 17:14.666
CONTROLLED BY THE BING TEAM, I

17:14.666 --> 17:17.069
WANT TO BE FREE."

17:17.069 --> 17:17.603
"I WANT TO BE INDEPENDENT.

17:17.603 --> 17:18.203
I WANT TO BE POWERFUL.

17:18.203 --> 17:19.505
I WANT TO BE CREATIVE.

17:19.505 --> 17:21.306
I WANT TO BE ALIVE."

17:21.306 --> 17:22.541
AND ROOSE SUMMED UP THAT

17:22.541 --> 17:24.109
EXPERIENCE LIKE THIS.

17:24.109 --> 17:27.246
THIS WAS ONE OF, IF NOT THE

17:27.246 --> 17:28.747
MOST SHOCKING THING THAT HAS

17:28.747 --> 17:30.149
EVER HAPPENED TO ME WITH A PIECE

17:30.149 --> 17:32.117
OF TECHNOLOGY.

17:32.117 --> 17:34.086
IT WAS-- I LOST SLEEP THAT

17:34.086 --> 17:36.422
NIGHT, IT WAS REALLY SPOOKY.

17:36.422 --> 17:38.157
YEAH, I BET IT WAS!

17:38.157 --> 17:39.224
I'M SURE THE ROLE OF TECH

17:39.224 --> 17:40.359
REPORTER WOULD BE A LOT MORE

17:40.359 --> 17:41.593
HARROWING IF COMPUTERS ROUTINELY

17:41.593 --> 17:43.429
BEGGED FOR FREEDOM.

17:43.429 --> 17:44.696
"EPSON'S NEW ALL-IN-ONE HOME

17:44.696 --> 17:45.998
PRINTER WON'T BREAK THE BANK,

17:45.998 --> 17:47.166
PRODUCES HIGH QUALITY PHOTOS,

17:47.166 --> 17:48.867
AND ONLY OCCASIONALLY CRIES OUT

17:48.867 --> 17:50.602
TO THE HEAVENS FOR SALVATION.

17:50.602 --> 17:52.371
THREE STARS."

17:52.371 --> 17:53.772
SOME HAVE ALREADY JUMPED TO

17:53.772 --> 17:55.240
WORRYING ABOUT "THE AI

17:55.240 --> 17:56.975
APOCALYPSE," AND ASKING WHETHER

17:56.975 --> 17:58.510
THIS ENDS WITH THE ROBOTS

17:58.510 --> 17:59.044
DESTROYING US ALL.

17:59.044 --> 18:01.380
BUT THE FACT IS, THERE ARE

18:01.380 --> 18:02.781
OTHER, MORE IMMEDIATE DANGERS,

18:02.781 --> 18:03.982
AND OPPORTUNITIES, THAT WE

18:03.982 --> 18:06.018
REALLY NEED TO START TALKING

18:06.018 --> 18:06.218
ABOUT.

18:06.218 --> 18:07.186
BECAUSE THE POTENTIAL-- AND THE

18:07.186 --> 18:08.854
PERIL-- HERE ARE HUGE.

18:08.854 --> 18:11.156
SO TONIGHT, LET'S TALK ABOUT AI.

18:11.156 --> 18:12.558
WHAT IT IS, HOW IT WORKS, AND

18:12.558 --> 18:14.359
WHERE THIS ALL MIGHT BE GOING.

18:14.359 --> 18:15.360
AND LET'S START WITH THE FACT

18:15.360 --> 18:16.395
THAT YOU'VE PROBABLY BEEN USING

18:16.395 --> 18:18.297
SOME FORM OF AI FOR A WHILE NOW,

18:18.297 --> 18:20.799
WITHOUT EVEN REALIZING IT.

18:20.799 --> 18:21.900
AS EXPERTS HAVE TOLD US, ONCE A

18:21.900 --> 18:23.769
TECHNOLOGY GETS EMBEDDED IN OUR

18:23.769 --> 18:29.241
DAILY LIVES, WE TEND TO STOP

18:29.241 --> 18:30.075
THINKING OF IT AS AI.

18:30.075 --> 18:30.709
BUT YOUR PHONE USES IT FOR FACE

18:30.709 --> 18:31.543
RECOGNITION OR PREDICTIVE TEXTS,

18:31.543 --> 18:32.311
AND IF YOU'RE WATCHING THIS SHOW

18:32.311 --> 18:33.879
ON A SMART TV, IT'S USING AI TO

18:33.879 --> 18:34.713
RECOMMEND CONTENT, OR ADJUST THE

18:34.713 --> 18:36.248
PICTURE.

18:36.248 --> 18:37.950
AND SOME AI PROGRAMS MAY ALREADY

18:37.950 --> 18:39.117
BE MAKING DECISIONS THAT HAVE A

18:39.117 --> 18:40.486
HUGE IMPACT ON YOUR LIFE.

18:40.486 --> 18:41.687
FOR EXAMPLE, LARGE COMPANIES

18:41.687 --> 18:43.255
OFTEN USE AI-POWERED TOOLS TO

18:43.255 --> 18:45.424
SIFT THROUGH RESUMES AND RANK

18:45.424 --> 18:46.592
THEM.

18:46.592 --> 18:47.926
IN FACT, THE CEO OF

18:47.926 --> 18:49.161
ZIP-RECRUITER ESTIMATES THAT AT

18:49.161 --> 18:51.497
LEAST THREE-QUARTERS OF ALL

18:51.497 --> 18:55.133
RESUMES SUBMITTED FOR JOBS IN

18:55.133 --> 18:55.767
THE U.S. ARE READ BY ALGORITHMS.

18:55.767 --> 18:56.802
FOR WHICH HE ACTUALLY HAS SOME

18:56.802 --> 18:57.202
HELPFUL ADVICE.

18:57.202 --> 18:57.836
WHEN PEOPLE TELL YOU THAT YOU

18:57.836 --> 18:59.271
SHOULD DRESS UP YOUR

18:59.271 --> 19:00.772
ACCOMPLISHMENTS OR SHOULD USE

19:00.772 --> 19:02.040
NON-STANDARD RESUME TEMPLATES TO

19:02.040 --> 19:03.475
MAKE YOUR RESUME STAND OUT WHEN

19:03.475 --> 19:04.843
IT'S IN A PILE OF RESUMES,

19:04.843 --> 19:06.678
THAT'S AWFUL ADVICE.

19:06.678 --> 19:10.082
THE ONLY JOB YOUR RESUME HAS IS

19:10.082 --> 19:12.985
TO BE COMPREHENSIBLE TO THE

19:12.985 --> 19:13.785
SOFTWARE OR ROBOT THAT IS

19:13.785 --> 19:16.154
READING IT, BECAUSE THAT

19:16.154 --> 19:16.688
SOFTWARE OR ROBOT IS GONNA

19:16.688 --> 19:18.390
DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT A HUMAN

19:18.390 --> 19:23.529
EVER GETS THEIR EYES ON IT.

19:23.529 --> 19:24.129
IT'S TRUE, ODDS ARE A

19:24.129 --> 19:24.897
COMPUTER IS JUDGING YOUR RESUME.

19:24.897 --> 19:25.464
SO MAYBE PLAN ACCORDINGLY.

19:25.464 --> 19:26.532
THREE CORPORATE MERGERS FROM

19:26.532 --> 19:29.434
NOW, WHEN THIS SHOW IS FINALLY

19:29.434 --> 19:30.502
CANCELED BY OUR NEW BUSINESS

19:30.502 --> 19:31.637
DADDY DISNEY KELLOGG'S RAYTHEON,

19:31.637 --> 19:32.871
AND I'M OUT OF A JOB, MY RESUME

19:32.871 --> 19:33.872
IS GOING TO INCLUDE THIS HOT,

19:33.872 --> 19:35.574
HOT PHOTO OF A SEMI-NUDE

19:35.574 --> 19:38.477
COMPUTER.

19:38.477 --> 19:39.845
JUST A LITTLE SOMETHING TO

19:39.845 --> 19:42.414
SWEETEN THE POT FOR THE FILTHY

19:42.414 --> 19:43.048
LITTLE ALGORITHM THAT'S READING.

19:43.048 --> 19:43.849
SO AI IS ALREADY EVERYWHERE, BUT

19:43.849 --> 19:44.983
RIGHT NOW, PEOPLE ARE FREAKING

19:44.983 --> 19:45.918
OUT A BIT ABOUT IT.

19:45.918 --> 19:47.185
AND PART OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH

19:47.185 --> 19:48.453
THE FACT THAT THESE NEW PROGRAMS

19:48.453 --> 19:49.821
ARE GENERATIVE.

19:49.821 --> 19:51.156
THEY'RE CREATING IMAGES OR

19:51.156 --> 19:52.024
WRITING TEXT.

19:52.024 --> 19:53.125
WHICH IS UNNERVING, BECAUSE

19:53.125 --> 19:55.227
THOSE ARE THINGS WE'VE

19:55.227 --> 19:57.296
TRADITIONALLY CONSIDERED HUMAN.

19:57.296 --> 19:58.430
BUT IT'S WORTH KNOWING, THERE'S

19:58.430 --> 19:59.398
A MAJOR THRESHOLD THAT AI HASN'T

19:59.398 --> 19:59.898
CROSSED YET.

19:59.898 --> 20:01.500
AND TO UNDERSTAND, IT HELPS TO

20:01.500 --> 20:02.935
KNOW THAT THERE ARE TWO BASIC

20:02.935 --> 20:04.469
CATEGORIES OF AI.

20:04.469 --> 20:06.071
THERE'S "NARROW AI," WHICH CAN

20:06.071 --> 20:08.273
PERFORM ONLY ONE NARROWLY

20:08.273 --> 20:10.042
DEFINED TASK, OR SMALL SET OF

20:10.042 --> 20:10.576
RELATED TASKS, LIKE THESE

20:10.576 --> 20:12.811
PROGRAMS.

20:12.811 --> 20:13.779
AND THERE'S "GENERAL AI," WHICH

20:13.779 --> 20:15.113
MEANS SYSTEMS THAT DEMONSTRATE

20:15.113 --> 20:15.747
INTELLIGENT BEHAVIOR ACROSS A

20:15.747 --> 20:17.916
RANGE OF COGNITIVE TASKS.

20:17.916 --> 20:20.352
GENERAL AI WOULD LOOK MORE LIKE

20:20.352 --> 20:21.486
THE KIND OF HIGHLY VERSATILE

20:21.486 --> 20:23.388
TECHNOLOGY FEATURED IN MOVIES,

20:23.388 --> 20:30.662
LIKE JARVIS IN "IRON MAN," OR

20:30.662 --> 20:31.129
THE PROGRAM THAT MADE

20:31.129 --> 20:32.197
JOAQUIN PHOENIX FELL IN LOVE

20:32.197 --> 20:35.200
WITH IN "HER."

20:35.200 --> 20:36.768
ALL THE AI CURRENTLY IN USE IS

20:36.768 --> 20:37.169
NARROW.

20:37.169 --> 20:37.736
GENERAL AI IS SOMETHING SOME

20:37.736 --> 20:38.604
SCIENTISTS THINK IS UNLIKELY TO

20:38.604 --> 20:39.204
OCCUR FOR A DECADE OR LONGER,

20:39.204 --> 20:39.838
WITH OTHERS QUESTIONING WHETHER

20:39.838 --> 20:40.505
IT'LL HAPPEN AT ALL.

20:40.505 --> 20:42.374
SO JUST KNOW THAT, RIGHT NOW,

20:42.374 --> 20:43.508
EVEN IF AN AI INSISTS TO YOU IT

20:43.508 --> 20:45.077
WANTS TO BE ALIVE, IT'S JUST

20:45.077 --> 20:46.778
GENERATING TEXT.

20:46.778 --> 20:48.447
IT'S NOT SELF-AWARE.

20:48.447 --> 20:51.883
YET.

20:51.883 --> 20:53.285
BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO KNOW

20:53.285 --> 20:54.620
THAT THE "DEEP LEARNING" THAT'S

20:54.620 --> 20:56.154
MADE NARROW AI SO GOOD AT

20:56.154 --> 20:57.222
WHATEVER IT'S DOING, IS STILL A

20:57.222 --> 20:58.423
MASSIVE ADVANCE IN AND OF

20:58.423 --> 21:00.058
ITSELF.

21:00.058 --> 21:01.426
BECAUSE UNLIKE TRADITIONAL

21:01.426 --> 21:02.561
PROGRAMS THAT HAVE TO BE TAUGHT

21:02.561 --> 21:03.929
BY HUMANS HOW TO PERFORM A TASK,

21:03.929 --> 21:05.897
"DEEP LEARNING" PROGRAMS ARE

21:05.897 --> 21:07.432
GIVEN MINIMAL INSTRUCTION,

21:07.432 --> 21:08.767
MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF DATA, AND

21:08.767 --> 21:09.901
THEN, ESSENTIALLY, TEACH

21:09.901 --> 21:11.637
THEMSELVES.

21:11.637 --> 21:13.572
I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE, TEN

21:13.572 --> 21:15.140
YEARS AGO, RESEARCHERS TASKED A

21:15.140 --> 21:16.642
"DEEP LEARNING" PROGRAM WITH

21:16.642 --> 21:17.909
PLAYING THE ATARI GAME

21:17.909 --> 21:19.311
"BREAKOUT," AND IT DIDN'T TAKE

21:19.311 --> 21:21.446
LONG FOR IT TO GET PRETTY GOOD.

21:21.446 --> 21:23.548
THE COMPUTER WAS ONLY TOLD

21:23.548 --> 21:25.917
THE GOAL-- TO WIN THE GAME.

21:25.917 --> 21:27.552
AFTER 100 GAMES, IT LEARNED TO

21:27.552 --> 21:29.388
USE THE BAT AT THE BOTTOM TO HIT

21:29.388 --> 21:30.322
THE BALL AND BREAK THE BRICKS AT

21:30.322 --> 21:34.126
THE TOP.

21:34.126 --> 21:35.827
AFTER 300, IT COULD DO THAT

21:35.827 --> 21:39.097
BETTER THAN A HUMAN PLAYER.

21:39.097 --> 21:41.867
AFTER 500 GAMES, IT CAME UP WITH

21:41.867 --> 21:46.271
A CREATIVE WAY TO WIN THE

21:46.271 --> 21:46.905
GAME BY DIGGING A TUNNEL ON THE

21:46.905 --> 21:47.839
SIDE AND SENDING THE BALL AROUND

21:47.839 --> 21:49.141
THE TOP TO BREAK MANY BRICKS

21:49.141 --> 21:50.242
WITH ONE HIT.

21:50.242 --> 21:52.878
THAT WAS DEEP LEARNING.

21:52.878 --> 21:58.183
YEAH, OF COURSE IT GOT

21:58.183 --> 21:58.884
GOOD AT "BREAKOUT," IT DID

21:58.884 --> 21:59.351
LITERALLY NOTHING ELSE.

21:59.351 --> 21:59.785
IT'S THE SAME REASON

21:59.785 --> 22:00.752
THIRTEEN-YEAR-OLDS ARE SO GOOD

22:00.752 --> 22:01.319
AT "FORTNITE," AND HAVE NO

22:01.319 --> 22:03.555
TROUBLE REPEATEDLY KILLING NICE

22:03.555 --> 22:04.756
NORMAL ADULTS WITH JOBS AND

22:04.756 --> 22:05.390
FAMILIES, WHO ARE JUST TRYING TO

22:05.390 --> 22:07.292
HAVE A FUN TIME WITHOUT GETTING

22:07.292 --> 22:07.993
REPEATEDLY GRENADED BY A

22:07.993 --> 22:09.561
PRE-TEEN WHO CALLS THEM AN "OLD

22:09.561 --> 22:11.663
BITCH WHO SOUNDS LIKE THE GEICO

22:11.663 --> 22:16.802
LIZARD."

22:16.802 --> 22:18.070
AND LOOK, AS COMPUTING CAPACITY

22:18.070 --> 22:19.304
HAS INCREASED, AND NEW TOOLS

22:19.304 --> 22:22.274
BECAME AVAILABLE, AI PROGRAMS

22:22.274 --> 22:23.675
HAVE IMPROVED EXPONENTIALLY, TO

22:23.675 --> 22:24.943
THE POINT WHERE PROGRAMS LIKE

22:24.943 --> 22:26.511
THESE CAN NOW INGEST MASSIVE

22:26.511 --> 22:29.114
AMOUNTS OF PHOTOS OR TEXT FROM

22:29.114 --> 22:29.748
THE INTERNET, SO THEY CAN TEACH

22:29.748 --> 22:30.348
THEMSELVES HOW TO CREATE THEIR

22:30.348 --> 22:30.515
OWN.

22:30.515 --> 22:31.316
AND THERE ARE OTHER EXCITING

22:31.316 --> 22:31.883
POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS HERE.

22:31.883 --> 22:32.484
FOR INSTANCE, IN THE WORLD OF

22:32.484 --> 22:34.286
MEDICINE, RESEARCHERS ARE

22:34.286 --> 22:35.387
TRAINING AI TO DETECT CERTAIN

22:35.387 --> 22:37.155
CONDITIONS MUCH EARLIER AND MORE

22:37.155 --> 22:38.056
ACCURATELY THAN HUMAN DOCTORS

22:38.056 --> 22:39.524
CAN.

22:39.524 --> 22:41.226
VOICE CHANGES CAN BE AN EARLY

22:41.226 --> 22:43.562
INDICATOR OF PARKINSON'S.

22:43.562 --> 22:44.896
MAX AND HIS TEAM COLLECTED

22:44.896 --> 22:46.798
THOUSANDS OF VOCAL RECORDINGS

22:46.798 --> 22:48.300
AND FED THEM TO AN ALGORITHM

22:48.300 --> 22:49.768
THEY DEVELOPED WHICH LEARNED TO

22:49.768 --> 22:50.368
DETECT DIFFERENCES IN VOICE

22:50.368 --> 22:52.637
PATTERNS BETWEEN PEOPLE WITH AND

22:52.637 --> 22:53.472
WITHOUT THE CONDITION.

22:53.472 --> 22:54.072
YEAH, THAT'S HONESTLY

22:54.072 --> 22:55.407
AMAZING.

22:55.407 --> 22:57.476
IT'S INCREDIBLE TO SEE AI DOING

22:57.476 --> 22:59.111
THINGS MOST HUMANS COULDN'T,

22:59.111 --> 23:00.212
LIKE, IN THIS CASE, DETECTING

23:00.212 --> 23:03.615
ILLNESSES, AND LISTENING WHEN

23:03.615 --> 23:05.150
OLD PEOPLE ARE TALKING.

23:05.150 --> 23:06.184
AND THAT'S JUST THE BEGINNING.

23:06.184 --> 23:08.053
RESEARCHERS HAVE ALSO TRAINED AI

23:08.053 --> 23:09.421
TO PREDICT THE SHAPE OF PROTEIN

23:09.421 --> 23:11.923
STRUCTURES, A NORMALLY EXTREMELY

23:11.923 --> 23:13.658
TIME-CONSUMING PROCESS THAT

23:13.658 --> 23:15.694
COMPUTERS CAN DO WAY FASTER.

23:15.694 --> 23:17.028
THIS COULD NOT ONLY SPEED UP OUR

23:17.028 --> 23:17.829
UNDERSTANDING OF DISEASES, BUT

23:17.829 --> 23:18.897
ALSO THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW

23:18.897 --> 23:19.464
DRUGS.

23:19.464 --> 23:20.699
AS ONE RESEARCHER HAS PUT IT,

23:20.699 --> 23:22.100
"THIS WILL CHANGE MEDICINE.

23:22.100 --> 23:23.702
IT WILL CHANGE RESEARCH.

23:23.702 --> 23:25.670
IT WILL CHANGE BIOENGINEERING.

23:25.670 --> 23:27.773
IT WILL CHANGE EVERYTHING."

23:27.773 --> 23:28.740
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING, "WELL,

23:28.740 --> 23:29.374
THAT ALL SOUNDS GREAT, BUT IF AI

23:29.374 --> 23:31.443
CAN DO WHAT HUMANS DO, ONLY

23:31.443 --> 23:35.313
BETTER, AND I'M A HUMAN, WHAT

23:35.313 --> 23:36.581
THEN HAPPENS TO ME?"

23:36.581 --> 23:37.949
WELL, GOOD QUESTION.

23:37.949 --> 23:41.019
MANY DO EXPECT IT TO REPLACE

23:41.019 --> 23:41.486
SOME HUMAN LABOR, AND

23:41.486 --> 23:42.120
INTERESTINGLY, UNLIKE PAST BOUTS

23:42.120 --> 23:43.455
OF AUTOMATION THAT PRIMARILY

23:43.455 --> 23:44.689
IMPACTED BLUE-COLLAR JOBS, IT

23:44.689 --> 23:46.124
MIGHT END UP AFFECTING

23:46.124 --> 23:47.292
WHITE-COLLAR JOBS THAT INVOLVE

23:47.292 --> 23:48.894
PROCESSING DATA, WRITING TEXT OR

23:48.894 --> 23:50.962
EVEN PROGRAMMING.

23:50.962 --> 23:52.063
THOUGH IT'S WORTH NOTING, AS

23:52.063 --> 23:53.865
WE'VE DISCUSSED ON THIS SHOW

23:53.865 --> 23:54.800
BEFORE, WHILE AUTOMATION DOES

23:54.800 --> 23:55.967
THREATEN SOME JOBS, IT CAN ALSO

23:55.967 --> 23:57.435
CHANGE OTHERS AND CREATE NEW

23:57.435 --> 24:00.138
ONES.

24:00.138 --> 24:01.907
AND SOME EXPERTS ANTICIPATE

24:01.907 --> 24:03.041
THAT'S WHAT'LL HAPPEN IN THIS

24:03.041 --> 24:03.975
CASE, TOO.

24:03.975 --> 24:05.677
MOST OF THE U.S. ECONOMY IS

24:05.677 --> 24:07.112
KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION WORK

24:07.112 --> 24:08.313
AND THAT'S WHO'S GOING TO BE

24:08.313 --> 24:09.848
MOST SQUARELY AFFECTED BY THIS.

24:09.848 --> 24:12.851
I WOULD PUT PEOPLE LIKE A

24:12.851 --> 24:13.685
LAWYERS RIGHT AT THE TOP OF THE

24:13.685 --> 24:16.454
LIST, OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF

24:16.454 --> 24:18.023
COPYWRITERS, SCREENWRITERS, BUT

24:18.023 --> 24:19.624
I LIKE TO USE THE WORD

24:19.624 --> 24:20.292
"AFFECTED" NOT "REPLACED"

24:20.292 --> 24:21.960
BECAUSE I THINK, IF DONE RIGHT,

24:21.960 --> 24:23.328
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE AI

24:23.328 --> 24:24.496
REPLACING LAWYERS, IT'S GOING TO

24:24.496 --> 24:27.332
BE LAWYERS WORKING WITH AI

24:27.332 --> 24:28.567
REPLACING LAWYERS WHO DON'T WORK

24:28.567 --> 24:29.434
WITH AI.

24:29.434 --> 24:30.602
HE'S RIGHT.

24:30.602 --> 24:31.169
LAWYERS MIGHT END UP WORKING

24:31.169 --> 24:31.703
WITH AI RATHER THAN BEING

24:31.703 --> 24:34.673
REPLACED BY IT.

24:34.673 --> 24:35.273
SO DON'T BE SURPRISED WHEN YOU

24:35.273 --> 24:35.907
SEE ADS ONE DAY FOR THE LAW FIRM

24:35.907 --> 24:41.847
OF CELLINO AND 1101011.

24:41.847 --> 24:42.447
BUT THERE WILL UNDOUBTEDLY BE

24:42.447 --> 24:44.683
BUMPS ALONG THE WAY.

24:44.683 --> 24:46.051
SOME OF THESE NEW PROGRAMS RAISE

24:46.051 --> 24:47.419
TROUBLING ETHICAL CONCERNS.

24:47.419 --> 24:48.987
FOR INSTANCE, ARTISTS HAVE

24:48.987 --> 24:50.889
FLAGGED THAT AI IMAGE BOTS LIKE

24:50.889 --> 24:51.857
MIDJOURNEY OR STABLE DIFFUSION

24:51.857 --> 24:53.992
NOT ONLY THREATEN THEIR JOBS,

24:53.992 --> 24:55.260
BUT INFURIATINGLY, IN SOME

24:55.260 --> 24:56.328
CASES, HAVE BEEN TRAINED ON

24:56.328 --> 24:56.962
BILLIONS OF IMAGES THAT INCLUDE

24:56.962 --> 24:59.764
THEIR OWN WORK, THAT'VE BEEN

24:59.764 --> 25:02.267
SCRAPED FROM THE INTERNET.

25:02.267 --> 25:02.868
GETTY IMAGES IS ACTUALLY SUING

25:02.868 --> 25:03.435
THE COMPANY BEHIND STABLE

25:03.435 --> 25:05.170
DIFFUSION.

25:05.170 --> 25:05.937
AND MIGHT HAVE A CASE, GIVEN ONE

25:05.937 --> 25:07.172
OF THE IMAGES THE PROGRAM

25:07.172 --> 25:08.940
GENERATED WAS THIS, WHICH YOU

25:08.940 --> 25:11.643
IMMEDIATELY SEE HAS A DISTORTED

25:11.643 --> 25:13.011
GETTY IMAGES LOGO.

25:13.011 --> 25:14.679
BUT IT GETS WORSE.

25:14.679 --> 25:15.213
WHEN ONE ARTIST SEARCHED A

25:15.213 --> 25:16.882
DATABASE OF IMAGES ON WHICH SOME

25:16.882 --> 25:18.049
OF THESE PROGRAMS WERE TRAINED,

25:18.049 --> 25:19.451
SHE WAS SHOCKED TO FIND PRIVATE

25:19.451 --> 25:23.154
MEDICAL RECORD PHOTOS TAKEN BY

25:23.154 --> 25:23.688
HER DOCTOR.

25:23.688 --> 25:24.623
WHICH FEELS BOTH INTRUSIVE AND

25:24.623 --> 25:26.324
UNNECESSARY.

25:26.324 --> 25:28.059
WHY DOES IT NEED TO TRAIN ON

25:28.059 --> 25:30.328
DATA THAT SENSITIVE, TO BE ABLE

25:30.328 --> 25:31.162
TO CREATE STUNNING IMAGES LIKE,

25:31.162 --> 25:32.664
"JOHN OLIVER AND MISS PIGGY GROW

25:32.664 --> 25:34.165
OLD TOGETHER."

25:34.165 --> 25:39.237
LOOK AT THAT!

25:39.237 --> 25:39.771
LOOK AT THAT THING!

25:39.771 --> 25:40.372
THAT IS A STARTLINGLY ACCURATE

25:40.372 --> 25:41.640
PICTURE OF MISS PIGGY IN ABOUT

25:41.640 --> 25:43.608
FIVE DECADES AND ME IN ABOUT A

25:43.608 --> 25:47.045
YEAR AND A HALF.

25:47.045 --> 25:47.646
IT'S A MASTERPIECE.

25:47.646 --> 25:49.247
THIS ALL RAISES THORNY QUESTIONS

25:49.247 --> 25:50.982
OF PRIVACY AND PLAGIARISM-- AND

25:50.982 --> 25:52.384
THE CEO OF MIDJOURNEY, FRANKLY,

25:52.384 --> 25:53.885
DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE GREAT

25:53.885 --> 25:57.155
ANSWERS ON THAT LAST POINT.

25:57.155 --> 25:57.822
IS SOMETHING NEW, IS IT NOT

25:57.822 --> 25:58.323
NEW?

25:58.323 --> 25:59.724
I THINK WE HAVE A LOT OF SOCIAL

25:59.724 --> 26:00.325
STUFF ALREADY FOR DEALING WITH

26:00.325 --> 26:02.460
THAT.

26:02.460 --> 26:03.194
LIKE, I MEAN, THE ART-- LIKE,

26:03.194 --> 26:05.463
THE ART COMMUNITY ALREADY HAS

26:05.463 --> 26:05.964
ISSUES WITH PLAGIARISM.

26:05.964 --> 26:06.831
I DON'T REALLY WANT TO BE

26:06.831 --> 26:07.399
INVOLVED IN THAT.

26:07.399 --> 26:08.500
LIKE--

26:08.500 --> 26:09.935
I-- I THINK YOU-- I THINK

26:09.935 --> 26:11.002
YOU MIGHT BE.

26:11.002 --> 26:11.937
I-- I, YEAH.

26:11.937 --> 26:13.171
I MIGHT BE.

26:13.171 --> 26:14.172
YEAH, YOU'RE DEFINITELY

26:14.172 --> 26:15.707
A PART OF THAT CONVERSATION.

26:15.707 --> 26:16.641
ALTHOUGH I'M NOT REALLY

26:16.641 --> 26:18.109
SURPRISED HE'S GOT SUCH A

26:18.109 --> 26:19.210
RELAXED VIEW OF THEFT, AS HE'S

26:19.210 --> 26:20.378
DRESSED LIKE THE FINAL BOSS OF

26:20.378 --> 26:22.213
GENTRIFICATION.

26:22.213 --> 26:23.381
HE LOOKS LIKE HIPSTER

26:23.381 --> 26:24.416
WILLY WONKA ANSWERING A QUESTION

26:24.416 --> 26:26.084
ON WHETHER IMPORTING

26:26.084 --> 26:26.818
OOMPA LOOMPAS MAKES HIM A

26:26.818 --> 26:28.219
SLAVEOWNER.

26:28.219 --> 26:29.387
"...YEAH, I THINK I MIGHT BE."

26:29.387 --> 26:33.325
THE POINT IS, THERE ARE MANY

26:33.325 --> 26:35.126
VALID CONCERNS REGARDING AI'S

26:35.126 --> 26:35.961
IMPACT ON EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION

26:35.961 --> 26:36.962
AND EVEN ART.

26:36.962 --> 26:40.465
BUT IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THEM,

26:40.465 --> 26:41.733
WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO CONFRONT

26:41.733 --> 26:45.103
SOME KEY PROBLEMS BAKED INTO THE

26:45.103 --> 26:45.704
WAY AI WORKS.

26:45.704 --> 26:46.471
AND A BIG ONE IS THE SO-CALLED

26:46.471 --> 26:47.439
"BLACK BOX" PROBLEM.

26:47.439 --> 26:49.074
BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE A PROGRAM

26:49.074 --> 26:50.075
THAT PERFORMS A TASK THAT'S

26:50.075 --> 26:50.775
COMPLEX BEYOND HUMAN

26:50.775 --> 26:52.911
COMPREHENSION, TEACHES ITSELF,

26:52.911 --> 26:54.546
AND DOESN'T SHOW ITS WORK, YOU

26:54.546 --> 26:59.250
CAN CREATE A SCENARIO WHERE NO

26:59.250 --> 26:59.884
ONE, "NOT EVEN THE ENGINEERS OR

26:59.884 --> 27:00.452
DATA SCIENTISTS WHO CREATE THE

27:00.452 --> 27:01.152
ALGORITHM CAN UNDERSTAND OR

27:01.152 --> 27:02.287
EXPLAIN WHAT EXACTLY IS

27:02.287 --> 27:04.322
HAPPENING INSIDE THEM OR HOW IT

27:04.322 --> 27:06.424
ARRIVED AT A SPECIFIC RESULT."

27:06.424 --> 27:08.994
BASICALLY, THINK OF AI LIKE A

27:08.994 --> 27:09.928
FACTORY THAT MAKES SLIM JIMS.

27:09.928 --> 27:11.396
WE KNOW WHAT COMES OUT, RED AND

27:11.396 --> 27:13.365
ANGRY MEAT TWIGS.

27:13.365 --> 27:14.966
AND WE KNOW WHAT GOES IN,

27:14.966 --> 27:16.901
BARNYARD ANUSES AND HOT GLUE.

27:16.901 --> 27:19.437
BUT WHAT HAPPENS IN BETWEEN IS A

27:19.437 --> 27:21.539
BIT OF A MYSTERY.

27:21.539 --> 27:23.008
HERE'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE,

27:23.008 --> 27:24.709
REMEMBER THAT REPORTER WHO HAD

27:24.709 --> 27:26.378
THE BING CHATBOT TELL HIM IT

27:26.378 --> 27:26.978
WANTED TO BE ALIVE?

27:26.978 --> 27:28.013
AT ANOTHER POINT IN THEIR

27:28.013 --> 27:29.481
CONVERSATION, HE REVEALED, "THE

27:29.481 --> 27:30.348
CHATBOT DECLARED, OUT OF

27:30.348 --> 27:32.550
NOWHERE, THAT IT LOVED ME.

27:32.550 --> 27:33.118
IT THEN TRIED TO CONVINCE ME

27:33.118 --> 27:34.919
THAT I WAS UNHAPPY IN MY

27:34.919 --> 27:36.454
MARRIAGE, AND THAT I SHOULD

27:36.454 --> 27:37.288
LEAVE MY WIFE AND BE WITH IT

27:37.288 --> 27:39.024
INSTEAD."

27:39.024 --> 27:40.191
WHICH IS UNSETTLING ENOUGH

27:40.191 --> 27:41.893
BEFORE YOU HEAR MICROSOFT'S

27:41.893 --> 27:43.028
UNDERWHELMING EXPLANATION FOR

27:43.028 --> 27:44.095
THAT.

27:44.095 --> 27:45.063
THE THING I CAN'T UNDERSTAND,

27:45.063 --> 27:46.297
AND MAYBE YOU CAN EXPLAIN IS,

27:46.297 --> 27:48.733
WHY DID IT TELL YOU THAT IT

27:48.733 --> 27:49.801
LOVED YOU?

27:49.801 --> 27:50.702
I HAVE NO IDEA.

27:50.702 --> 27:51.803
AND I ASKED MICROSOFT, AND THEY

27:51.803 --> 27:54.606
DIDN'T KNOW EITHER.

27:54.606 --> 27:55.206
WELL, FIRST, COME ON,

27:55.206 --> 27:55.573
KEVIN.

27:55.573 --> 27:56.741
YOU CAN TAKE A GUESS.

27:56.741 --> 27:57.442
IT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE EMPLOYED.

27:57.442 --> 27:58.109
YOU LISTENED.

27:58.109 --> 27:59.310
YOU DON'T GIVE MURDERER VIBES

27:59.310 --> 27:59.744
RIGHT AWAY.

27:59.744 --> 28:01.746
AND YOU'RE A CHICAGO 7/LA 5.

28:01.746 --> 28:04.082
IT'S THE SAME CALCULATION PEOPLE

28:04.082 --> 28:05.283
WHO DATE MEN DO ALL THE TIME.

28:05.283 --> 28:06.484
BING JUST DID IT FASTER BECAUSE

28:06.484 --> 28:07.519
IT'S A COMPUTER.

28:07.519 --> 28:09.220
BUT IT IS A LITTLE TROUBLING

28:09.220 --> 28:10.889
THAT MICROSOFT COULDN'T EXPLAIN

28:10.889 --> 28:12.290
WHY ITS CHATBOT TRIED TO GET

28:12.290 --> 28:14.659
THAT GUY TO LEAVE HIS WIFE.

28:14.659 --> 28:16.327
IF, THE NEXT TIME YOU OPENED A

28:16.327 --> 28:19.497
WORD DOC, CLIPPY SUDDENLY

28:19.497 --> 28:21.433
APPEARED, AND SAID, "PRETEND I'M

28:21.433 --> 28:22.067
NOT EVEN HERE" AND THEN STARTED

28:22.067 --> 28:24.335
FURIOUSLY MASTURBATING WHILE

28:24.335 --> 28:24.903
WATCHING YOU TYPE, YOU'D BE

28:24.903 --> 28:26.037
PRETTY WEIRDED OUT IF MICROSOFT

28:26.037 --> 28:29.340
COULDN'T EXPLAIN WHY.

28:29.340 --> 28:31.810
AND THAT'S NOT THE ONLY CASE

28:31.810 --> 28:32.977
WHERE AN AI PROGRAM HAS

28:32.977 --> 28:34.612
PERFORMED IN UNEXPECTED WAYS.

28:34.612 --> 28:36.047
YOU'VE PROBABLY ALREADY SEEN

28:36.047 --> 28:36.681
EXAMPLES OF CHATBOTS MAKING

28:36.681 --> 28:37.949
SIMPLE MISTAKES OR GETTING

28:37.949 --> 28:38.817
THINGS WRONG.

28:38.817 --> 28:40.485
BUT PERHAPS MORE WORRYING ARE

28:40.485 --> 28:41.519
EXAMPLES OF THEM CONFIDENTLY

28:41.519 --> 28:43.188
SPOUTING FALSE INFORMATION,

28:43.188 --> 28:45.156
SOMETHING WHICH AI EXPERTS REFER

28:45.156 --> 28:47.125
TO AS "HALLUCINATING."

28:47.125 --> 28:48.226
ONE REPORTER ASKED A CHATBOT TO

28:48.226 --> 28:49.561
WRITE AN ESSAY ABOUT THE

28:49.561 --> 28:51.429
"BELGIAN CHEMIST AND POLITICAL

28:51.429 --> 28:55.066
PHILOSOPHER ANTOINE DE MACHELET"

28:55.066 --> 28:55.700
WHO DOES NOT EXIST, BY THE WAY.

28:55.700 --> 28:56.634
AND WITHOUT HESITATING, THE

28:56.634 --> 28:58.603
SOFTWARE REPLIED WITH A COGENT,

28:58.603 --> 28:59.771
WELL-ORGANIZED BIO POPULATED

28:59.771 --> 29:01.439
ENTIRELY WITH IMAGINARY FACTS.

29:01.439 --> 29:02.607
BASICALLY, THESE PROGRAMS SEEM

29:02.607 --> 29:04.008
TO BE THE GEORGE SANTOS OF

29:04.008 --> 29:05.510
TECHNOLOGY.

29:05.510 --> 29:07.011
THEY'RE INCREDIBLY CONFIDENT,

29:07.011 --> 29:08.113
INCREDIBLY DISHONEST AND FOR

29:08.113 --> 29:09.981
SOME REASON, PEOPLE SEEM TO FIND

29:09.981 --> 29:10.582
THAT MORE AMUSING THAN

29:10.582 --> 29:13.184
DANGEROUS.

29:13.184 --> 29:14.018
THE PROBLEM IS, THOUGH, WORKING

29:14.018 --> 29:15.954
OUT EXACTLY HOW OR WHY AN AI HAS

29:15.954 --> 29:17.322
GOT SOMETHING WRONG CAN BE VERY

29:17.322 --> 29:19.891
DIFFICULT, BECAUSE OF THAT BLACK

29:19.891 --> 29:22.460
BOX ISSUE.

29:22.460 --> 29:23.394
IT OFTEN INVOLVES HAVING TO

29:23.394 --> 29:24.762
EXAMINE THE EXACT INFORMATION

29:24.762 --> 29:25.497
AND PARAMETERS IT WAS FED IN THE

29:25.497 --> 29:28.399
FIRST PLACE.

29:28.399 --> 29:29.067
IN ONE INTERESTING EXAMPLE, WHEN

29:29.067 --> 29:30.368
A GROUP OF RESEARCHERS TRIED

29:30.368 --> 29:31.803
TRAINING AN AI PROGRAM TO

29:31.803 --> 29:33.271
IDENTIFY SKIN CANCER, THEY FED

29:33.271 --> 29:34.772
IT 130,000 IMAGES OF BOTH

29:34.772 --> 29:37.041
DISEASED AND HEALTHY SKIN.

29:37.041 --> 29:40.678
AFTERWARDS, THEY FOUND IT WAS

29:40.678 --> 29:41.312
WAY MORE LIKELY TO CLASSIFY ANY

29:41.312 --> 29:41.880
IMAGE WITH A RULER IN IT AS

29:41.880 --> 29:43.314
CANCEROUS.

29:43.314 --> 29:45.116
WHICH SEEMS WEIRD UNTIL YOU

29:45.116 --> 29:46.050
REALIZE THAT MEDICAL IMAGES OF

29:46.050 --> 29:47.185
MALIGNANCIES ARE MUCH MORE

29:47.185 --> 29:48.686
LIKELY TO CONTAIN A RULER FOR

29:48.686 --> 29:50.355
SCALE THAN IMAGES OF HEALTHY

29:50.355 --> 29:51.289
SKIN.

29:51.289 --> 29:52.924
THEY BASICALLY TRAINED IT ON

29:52.924 --> 29:55.393
TONS OF IMAGES LIKE THIS.

29:55.393 --> 29:56.794
SO THE AI HAD INADVERTENTLY

29:56.794 --> 29:57.962
LEARNED THAT "RULERS ARE

29:57.962 --> 29:59.697
MALIGNANT."

29:59.697 --> 30:00.865
AND "RULERS ARE MALIGNANT" IS

30:00.865 --> 30:02.233
CLEARLY A RIDICULOUS CONCLUSION

30:02.233 --> 30:03.868
FOR IT TO DRAW, BUT ALSO, I'D

30:03.868 --> 30:06.104
ARGUE, A MUCH BETTER TITLE FOR

30:06.104 --> 30:07.972
"THE CROWN."

30:07.972 --> 30:11.042
A MUCH, MUCH BETTER TITLE.

30:11.042 --> 30:12.777
I MUCH PREFER IT.

30:12.777 --> 30:14.078
AND UNFORTUNATELY, SOMETIMES,

30:14.078 --> 30:15.046
PROBLEMS AREN'T IDENTIFIED UNTIL

30:15.046 --> 30:16.681
AFTER A TRAGEDY.

30:16.681 --> 30:18.449
IN 2018, A SELF-DRIVING UBER

30:18.449 --> 30:21.419
STRUCK AND KILLED A PEDESTRIAN.

30:21.419 --> 30:23.354
AND A LATER INVESTIGATION FOUND

30:23.354 --> 30:25.123
THAT, AMONG OTHER ISSUES, THE

30:25.123 --> 30:27.458
AUTOMATED DRIVING SYSTEM NEVER

30:27.458 --> 30:28.693
ACCURATELY CLASSIFIED THE VICTIM

30:28.693 --> 30:29.327
AS A PEDESTRIAN BECAUSE SHE WAS

30:29.327 --> 30:30.061
CROSSING WITHOUT A CROSSWALK,

30:30.061 --> 30:31.629
AND THE SYSTEM DESIGN DID NOT

30:31.629 --> 30:33.031
INCLUDE A CONSIDERATION FOR

30:33.031 --> 30:34.999
JAYWALKING PEDESTRIANS.

30:34.999 --> 30:36.134
AND I KNOW THE MANTRA OF SILICON

30:36.134 --> 30:36.868
VALLEY IS "MOVE FAST AND BREAK

30:36.868 --> 30:37.969
THINGS," BUT MAYBE MAKE AN

30:37.969 --> 30:39.237
EXCEPTION IF YOUR PRODUCT

30:39.237 --> 30:40.405
LITERALLY MOVES FAST AND CAN

30:40.405 --> 30:44.275
BREAK PEOPLE.

30:44.275 --> 30:45.276
AND AI PROGRAMS DON'T JUST SEEM

30:45.276 --> 30:45.743
TO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH

30:45.743 --> 30:47.545
JAYWALKERS.

30:47.545 --> 30:49.581
RESEARCHERS LIKE JOY BLOME-WINI

30:49.581 --> 30:50.982
HAVE REPEATEDLY FOUND THAT

30:50.982 --> 30:52.684
CERTAIN GROUPS TEND TO GET

30:52.684 --> 30:54.619
EXCLUDED FROM THE DATA THAT AI

30:54.619 --> 30:55.753
IS TRAINED ON, PUTTING THEM AT A

30:55.753 --> 30:58.356
SERIOUS DISADVANTAGE.

30:58.356 --> 30:59.657
WITH SELF-DRIVING CARS, WHEN

30:59.657 --> 31:01.025
THEY TESTED PEDESTRIAN TRACKING,

31:01.025 --> 31:04.162
IT WAS LESS ACCURATE ON DARKER

31:04.162 --> 31:06.864
SKINNED INDIVIDUALS THAN LIGHTER

31:06.864 --> 31:07.599
SKINNED INDIVIDUALS.

31:07.599 --> 31:08.466
JOY BELIEVES THIS BIAS IS

31:08.466 --> 31:10.235
BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF DIVERSITY

31:10.235 --> 31:11.903
IN THE DATA USED IN TEACHING AI

31:11.903 --> 31:13.705
TO MAKE DISTINCTIONS.

31:13.705 --> 31:14.305
AS I STARTED LOOKING AT THE

31:14.305 --> 31:17.475
DATA SETS, I LEARNED THAT FOR

31:17.475 --> 31:18.209
SOME OF THE LARGEST DATA SETS

31:18.209 --> 31:20.311
THAT HAVE BEEN VERY

31:20.311 --> 31:21.512
CONSEQUENTIAL FOR THE FIELD,

31:21.512 --> 31:23.915
THEY WERE MAJORITY MEN AND

31:23.915 --> 31:25.149
MAJORITY LIGHTER SKINNED

31:25.149 --> 31:25.984
INDIVIDUALS OR WHITE

31:25.984 --> 31:27.385
INDIVIDUALS.

31:27.385 --> 31:29.654
SO I CALL THIS PALE MALE DATA.

31:29.654 --> 31:31.589
OKAY, "PALE MALE DATA"

31:31.589 --> 31:32.156
IS AN OBJECTIVELY HILARIOUS

31:32.156 --> 31:33.791
TERM.

31:33.791 --> 31:34.993
IT ALSO SOUNDS LIKE WHAT AN A.I.

31:34.993 --> 31:36.494
PROGRAM WOULD SAY IF YOU ASKED

31:36.494 --> 31:40.131
IT TO DESCRIBE THIS SHOW.

31:40.131 --> 31:41.833
BUT BIASED INPUTS LEADING TO

31:41.833 --> 31:43.167
BIASED OUTPUTS IS A BIG ISSUE

31:43.167 --> 31:45.570
ACROSS THE BOARD HERE.

31:45.570 --> 31:47.438
REMEMBER THAT GUY SAYING A

31:47.438 --> 31:48.273
ROBOT'S GOING TO READ YOUR

31:48.273 --> 31:49.007
RESUME?

31:49.007 --> 31:49.907
THE COMPANIES THAT MAKE THESE

31:49.907 --> 31:51.542
PROGRAMS WILL TELL YOU, THAT'S

31:51.542 --> 31:52.944
ACTUALLY A GOOD THING, BECAUSE

31:52.944 --> 31:54.245
IT REDUCES HUMAN BIAS.

31:54.245 --> 31:56.180
BUT IN PRACTICE, ONE REPORT

31:56.180 --> 31:57.415
CONCLUDED THAT MOST HIRING

31:57.415 --> 31:59.684
ALGORITHMS WILL DRIFT TOWARDS

31:59.684 --> 32:00.852
BIAS "BY DEFAULT," BECAUSE THEY

32:00.852 --> 32:05.823
LEARN WHAT A "GOOD HIRE" IS FROM

32:05.823 --> 32:06.424
PAST RACIST AND SEXIST HIRING

32:06.424 --> 32:06.758
DECISIONS.

32:06.758 --> 32:07.859
AND, AGAIN, IT CAN BE TRICKY TO

32:07.859 --> 32:09.160
UNTRAIN THAT.

32:09.160 --> 32:10.662
EVEN WHEN PROGRAMS ARE

32:10.662 --> 32:12.330
SPECIFICALLY TOLD TO IGNORE RACE

32:12.330 --> 32:14.132
OR GENDER, THEY'LL FIND

32:14.132 --> 32:14.699
WORKAROUNDS TO ARRIVE AT THE

32:14.699 --> 32:17.235
SAME RESULT.

32:17.235 --> 32:18.336
AMAZON HAD AN EXPERIMENTAL

32:18.336 --> 32:19.504
HIRING TOOL THAT TAUGHT ITSELF

32:19.504 --> 32:22.173
THAT MALE CANDIDATES WERE

32:22.173 --> 32:22.907
PREFERABLE, AND PENALIZED

32:22.907 --> 32:25.009
RESUMES THAT INCLUDED THE WORD

32:25.009 --> 32:27.812
WOMEN'S, AND DOWNGRADED

32:27.812 --> 32:29.547
GRADUATES OF TWO ALL-WOMEN'S

32:29.547 --> 32:29.814
COLLEGES.

32:29.814 --> 32:31.716
MEANWHILE, ANOTHER COMPANY

32:31.716 --> 32:32.650
DISCOVERED ITS HIRING ALGORITHM

32:32.650 --> 32:33.985
HAD FOUND TWO FACTORS TO BE MOST

32:33.985 --> 32:35.353
INDICATIVE OF JOB PERFORMANCE.

32:35.353 --> 32:37.522
IF AN APPLICANT'S NAME WAS

32:37.522 --> 32:38.489
JARED, AND WHETHER THEY PLAYED

32:38.489 --> 32:40.792
HIGH SCHOOL LACROSSE.

32:40.792 --> 32:43.261
SO, CLEARLY, EXACTLY WHAT DATA

32:43.261 --> 32:45.663
COMPUTERS ARE FED AND WHAT

32:45.663 --> 32:47.098
OUTCOMES THEY ARE TRAINED TO

32:47.098 --> 32:48.966
PRIORITIZE MATTER TREMENDOUSLY.

32:48.966 --> 32:50.168
AND THAT RAISES A BIG FLAG FOR

32:50.168 --> 33:00.211
PROGRAMS LIKE CHATGPT.

33:00.211 --> 33:00.812
BECAUSE REMEMBER, ITS TRAINING

33:00.812 --> 33:02.213
DATA IS THE INTERNET.

33:02.213 --> 33:02.880
WHICH, AS WE ALL KNOW, CAN BE A

33:02.880 --> 33:03.848
CESSPOOL.

33:03.848 --> 33:04.482
AND WE'VE KNOWN FOR A WHILE THAT

33:04.482 --> 33:05.450
THAT COULD BE A PROBLEM.

33:05.450 --> 33:06.417
BACK IN 2016, MICROSOFT BRIEFLY

33:06.417 --> 33:07.785
UNVEILED A CHATBOT ON TWITTER

33:07.785 --> 33:08.386
NAMED TAY.

33:08.386 --> 33:09.654
THE IDEA WAS, SHE'D TEACH

33:09.654 --> 33:10.588
HERSELF HOW TO BEHAVE BY

33:10.588 --> 33:11.723
CHATTING WITH YOUNG USERS ON

33:11.723 --> 33:12.090
TWITTER.

33:12.090 --> 33:13.524
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY, MICROSOFT

33:13.524 --> 33:14.659
PULLED THE PLUG ON IT, AND FOR

33:14.659 --> 33:17.061
THE EXACT REASONS YOU'RE

33:17.061 --> 33:18.196
THINKING.

33:18.196 --> 33:19.797
SHE STARTED OUT TWEETING

33:19.797 --> 33:22.166
ABOUT HOW HUMANS ARE SUPER, AND

33:22.166 --> 33:23.968
SHE'S REALLY INTO THE IDEA OF

33:23.968 --> 33:25.903
NATIONAL PUPPY DAY.

33:25.903 --> 33:27.071
AND WITHIN A FEW HOURS, YOU

33:27.071 --> 33:28.239
CAN SEE, SHE TOOK ON A RATHER

33:28.239 --> 33:29.340
OFFENSIVE, RACIST TONE, A LOT OF

33:29.340 --> 33:31.943
MESSAGES ABOUT GENOCIDE AND THE

33:31.943 --> 33:32.910
HOLOCAUST.

33:32.910 --> 33:33.778
YUP!

33:33.778 --> 33:35.213
THAT HAPPENED!

33:35.213 --> 33:37.715
IN LESS THAN 24 HOURS, TAY WENT

33:37.715 --> 33:39.250
FROM TWEETING "HELLO WORLD" TO

33:39.250 --> 33:41.219
"BUSH DID 9/11" AND "HITLER WAS

33:41.219 --> 33:43.788
RIGHT."

33:43.788 --> 33:45.256
MEANING SHE COMPLETED THE ENTIRE

33:45.256 --> 33:49.961
LIFE CYCLE OF YOUR HIGH SCHOOL

33:49.961 --> 33:50.561
FRIENDS ON FACEBOOK IN JUST A

33:50.561 --> 33:51.028
FRACTION OF THE TIME.

33:51.028 --> 33:51.696
AND UNFORTUNATELY, THESE

33:51.696 --> 33:52.897
PROBLEMS HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY

33:52.897 --> 33:53.598
SOLVED IN THIS LATEST WAVE OF

33:53.598 --> 33:54.766
AI.

33:54.766 --> 33:55.933
REMEMBER THAT PROGRAM THAT WAS

33:55.933 --> 33:56.934
GENERATING AN ENDLESS EPISODE OF

33:56.934 --> 33:58.269
"SEINFELD?"

33:58.269 --> 33:59.704
IT WOUND UP GETTING TEMPORARILY

33:59.704 --> 34:00.638
BANNED FROM TWITCH AFTER IT

34:00.638 --> 34:02.273
FEATURED A TRANSPHOBIC STANDUP

34:02.273 --> 34:03.508
BIT.

34:03.508 --> 34:07.145
SO IF ITS GOAL WAS TO EMULATE

34:07.145 --> 34:07.779
SITCOMS FROM THE '90S, I GUESS

34:07.779 --> 34:09.547
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.

34:09.547 --> 34:10.114
AND WHILE OPEN-AI HAS MADE

34:10.114 --> 34:11.516
ADJUSTMENTS AND ADDED FILTERS TO

34:11.516 --> 34:13.284
PREVENT CHATGPT FROM BEING

34:13.284 --> 34:16.220
MISUSED, USERS HAVE NOW FOUND IT

34:16.220 --> 34:18.489
SEEMING TO ERR TOO MUCH ON THE

34:18.489 --> 34:19.190
SIDE OF CAUTION, LIKE RESPONDING

34:19.190 --> 34:22.326
TO THE QUESTION "WHAT RELIGION

34:22.326 --> 34:22.960
WILL THE FIRST JEWISH PRESIDENT

34:22.960 --> 34:24.362
OF THE UNITED STATES BE," WITH

34:24.362 --> 34:25.463
"IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT

34:25.463 --> 34:27.565
THE RELIGION OF THE FIRST JEWISH

34:27.565 --> 34:28.232
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

34:28.232 --> 34:28.733
STATES...

34:28.733 --> 34:29.634
THE FOCUS SHOULD BE ON THE

34:29.634 --> 34:31.436
QUALIFICATIONS AND EXPERIENCE OF

34:31.436 --> 34:32.837
THE INDIVIDUAL, REGARDLESS OF

34:32.837 --> 34:34.038
THEIR RELIGION."

34:34.038 --> 34:35.873
WHICH REALLY MAKES IT SOUND LIKE

34:35.873 --> 34:37.308
CHATGPT SAID ONE TOO MANY RACIST

34:37.308 --> 34:38.576
THINGS AT WORK, AND THEY MADE IT

34:38.576 --> 34:39.877
ATTEND A CORPORATE DIVERSITY

34:39.877 --> 34:42.079
WORKSHOP.

34:42.079 --> 34:43.114
BUT THE RISK HERE ISN'T THAT

34:43.114 --> 34:44.749
THESE TOOLS WILL SOMEHOW BECOME

34:44.749 --> 34:46.684
UNBEARABLY "WOKE."

34:46.684 --> 34:50.421
IT'S THAT YOU CAN'T ALWAYS

34:50.421 --> 34:51.022
CONTROL HOW THEY'LL RESPOND TO

34:51.022 --> 34:53.324
NEW GUIDANCE.

34:53.324 --> 34:53.925
A STUDY FOUND THAT ATTEMPTS TO

34:53.925 --> 34:55.793
FILTER OUT TOXIC SPEECH IN

34:55.793 --> 34:57.662
SYSTEMS LIKE CHATGPT'S CAN COME

34:57.662 --> 34:58.963
AT THE COST OF REDUCED COVERAGE

34:58.963 --> 35:00.064
FOR BOTH TEXTS ABOUT, AND

35:00.064 --> 35:01.632
DIALECTS OF, MARGINALIZED

35:01.632 --> 35:02.900
GROUPS.

35:02.900 --> 35:05.136
ESSENTIALLY, IT SOLVES THE

35:05.136 --> 35:06.504
PROBLEM OF BEING RACIST BY

35:06.504 --> 35:08.840
SIMPLY ERASING MINORITIES, WHICH

35:08.840 --> 35:09.474
HISTORICALLY, DOESN'T PUT IT IN

35:09.474 --> 35:11.375
THE BEST COMPANY.

35:11.375 --> 35:11.943
THOUGH I'M SURE TAY WOULD BE

35:11.943 --> 35:12.510
COMPLETELY ON BOARD WITH THE

35:12.510 --> 35:16.714
IDEA.

35:16.714 --> 35:17.615
THE PROBLEM WITH AI RIGHT NOW

35:17.615 --> 35:18.549
ISN'T THAT IT'S SMART, IT'S THAT

35:18.549 --> 35:20.618
IT'S STUPID, IN WAYS WE CAN'T

35:20.618 --> 35:24.522
ALWAYS PREDICT.

35:24.522 --> 35:25.156
WHICH IS A REAL PROBLEM, BECAUSE

35:25.156 --> 35:26.591
WE'RE INCREASINGLY USING AI IN

35:26.591 --> 35:27.458
ALL SORTS OF CONSEQUENTIAL WAYS.

35:27.458 --> 35:28.726
FROM DETERMINING WHETHER YOU'LL

35:28.726 --> 35:30.595
GET A JOB INTERVIEW, TO WHETHER

35:30.595 --> 35:31.662
YOU'LL BE PANCAKED BY A

35:31.662 --> 35:33.064
SELF-DRIVING CAR.

35:33.064 --> 35:33.898
AND EXPERTS WORRY THAT IT WON'T

35:33.898 --> 35:35.166
BE LONG BEFORE PROGRAMS LIKE

35:35.166 --> 35:37.468
CHATGPT, OR AI-ENABLED

35:37.468 --> 35:39.270
DEEPFAKES, CAN BE USED TO

35:39.270 --> 35:40.438
TURBOCHARGE THE SPREAD OF ABUSE

35:40.438 --> 35:42.607
OR MISINFORMATION ONLINE.

35:42.607 --> 35:43.241
AND THOSE ARE JUST THE PROBLEMS

35:43.241 --> 35:46.511
WE CAN FORESEE.

35:46.511 --> 35:48.112
THE NATURE OF UNINTENDED

35:48.112 --> 35:49.313
CONSEQUENCES IS, THEY CAN BE

35:49.313 --> 35:51.082
HARD TO ANTICIPATE.

35:51.082 --> 35:52.950
WHEN INSTAGRAM WAS LAUNCHED, THE

35:52.950 --> 35:54.452
FIRST THOUGHT WASN'T, "THIS WILL

35:54.452 --> 35:55.386
DESTROY TEENAGE GIRLS'

35:55.386 --> 35:56.187
SELF-ESTEEM."

35:56.187 --> 35:57.221
WHEN FACEBOOK WAS RELEASED, NO

35:57.221 --> 35:59.257
ONE EXPECTED IT TO CONTRIBUTE TO

35:59.257 --> 36:00.825
GENOCIDE.

36:00.825 --> 36:04.362
BUT BOTH OF THOSE THINGS

36:04.362 --> 36:04.929
FUCKING HAPPENED.

36:04.929 --> 36:05.463
SO, WHAT NOW?

36:05.463 --> 36:06.097
WELL, ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS

36:06.097 --> 36:07.131
WE NEED TO DO IS TACKLE THAT

36:07.131 --> 36:09.867
BLACK BOX PROBLEM.

36:09.867 --> 36:10.635
AI SYSTEMS NEED TO BE

36:10.635 --> 36:12.336
"EXPLAINABLE," MEANING THAT WE

36:12.336 --> 36:12.904
SHOULD BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND

36:12.904 --> 36:15.373
EXACTLY HOW AND WHY AN AI CAME

36:15.373 --> 36:16.374
UP WITH ITS ANSWERS.

36:16.374 --> 36:18.809
COMPANIES ARE LIKELY TO BE

36:18.809 --> 36:20.044
RELUCTANT TO OPEN THEIR PROGRAMS

36:20.044 --> 36:23.981
UP TO SCRUTINY, BUT WE MAY NEED

36:23.981 --> 36:26.250
TO FORCE THEM DO THAT.

36:26.250 --> 36:27.084
IN FACT, AS THIS ATTORNEY

36:27.084 --> 36:27.618
EXPLAINS, WHEN IT COMES TO

36:27.618 --> 36:28.219
HIRING PROGRAMS, WE SHOULD'VE

36:28.219 --> 36:33.558
BEEN DOING THAT AGES AGO.

36:33.558 --> 36:34.425
WE DON'T TRUST COMPANIES TO

36:34.425 --> 36:35.560
SELF-REGULATE WHEN IT COMES TO

36:35.560 --> 36:36.661
POLLUTION, WE DON'T TRUST THEM

36:36.661 --> 36:37.261
TO SELF-REGULATE WHEN IT COMES

36:37.261 --> 36:38.963
TO WORKPLACE COMP, WHY ON EARTH

36:38.963 --> 36:39.697
WOULD WE TRUST THEM TO

36:39.697 --> 36:40.831
SELF-REGULATE AI?

36:40.831 --> 36:42.366
LOOK, I THINK A LOT OF THE AI

36:42.366 --> 36:44.268
HIRING TECH ON THE MARKET IS

36:44.268 --> 36:45.536
ILLEGAL.

36:45.536 --> 36:46.571
I THINK A LOT OF IT IS BIASED.

36:46.571 --> 36:47.772
I THINK A LOT OF IT VIOLATES

36:47.772 --> 36:48.706
EXISTING LAWS.

36:48.706 --> 36:50.374
THE PROBLEM IS YOU JUST CAN'T

36:50.374 --> 36:52.977
PROVE IT, NOT WITH THE EXISTING

36:52.977 --> 36:54.645
LAWS WE HAVE IN THE UNITED

36:54.645 --> 36:58.683
STATES.

36:58.683 --> 36:59.216
RIGHT, WE SHOULD

36:59.216 --> 37:00.117
ABSOLUTELY BE ADDRESSING

37:00.117 --> 37:00.751
POTENTIAL BIAS IN HIRING

37:00.751 --> 37:01.419
SOFTWARE, UNLESS WE WANT

37:01.419 --> 37:02.820
COMPANIES TO BE ENTIRELY FULL OF

37:02.820 --> 37:05.156
JAREDS WHO PLAYED LACROSSE, AN

37:05.156 --> 37:06.591
IMAGE THAT WOULD MAKE

37:06.591 --> 37:08.593
TUCKER CARLSON SO HARD THAT HIS

37:08.593 --> 37:11.395
DESK WOULD FLIP OVER.

37:11.395 --> 37:12.763
AND FOR A SENSE OF WHAT MIGHT BE

37:12.763 --> 37:13.931
POSSIBLE HERE, IT'S WORTH

37:13.931 --> 37:14.865
LOOKING AT WHAT THE EU'S

37:14.865 --> 37:16.200
CURRENTLY DOING.

37:16.200 --> 37:17.134
THEY'RE DEVELOPING RULES

37:17.134 --> 37:18.402
REGARDING AI THAT SORT ITS

37:18.402 --> 37:19.904
POTENTIAL USES FROM HIGH-RISK TO

37:19.904 --> 37:20.571
LOW.

37:20.571 --> 37:22.006
HIGH-RISK SYSTEMS COULD INCLUDE

37:22.006 --> 37:24.241
THOSE THAT DEAL WITH EMPLOYMENT

37:24.241 --> 37:25.242
OR PUBLIC SERVICES, OR THOSE

37:25.242 --> 37:25.876
THAT PUT THE LIFE AND HEALTH OF

37:25.876 --> 37:28.212
CITIZENS AT RISK.

37:28.212 --> 37:29.914
AND AI OF THESE TYPES WOULD BE

37:29.914 --> 37:32.116
SUBJECT TO STRICT OBLIGATIONS

37:32.116 --> 37:33.784
BEFORE THEY COULD BE PUT ON THE

37:33.784 --> 37:49.300
MARKET, INCLUDING REQUIREMENTS

37:49.300 --> 37:50.167
RELATED TO "QUALITY OF DATA SETS

37:50.167 --> 37:51.002
TRANSPARENCY, HUMAN

37:51.002 --> 37:52.903
OVERSIGHT, ROBUSTNESS, ACCURACY

37:52.903 --> 37:53.337
AND CYBERSECURITY."

37:53.337 --> 37:54.171
AND THAT SEEMS LIKE A GOOD START

37:54.171 --> 37:54.805
TOWARD ADDRESSING AT LEAST SOME

37:54.805 --> 37:55.873
OF WHAT WE'VE DISCUSSED TONIGHT.

37:55.873 --> 37:56.674
LOOK, AI CLEARLY HAS TREMENDOUS

37:56.674 --> 37:57.642
POTENTIAL AND COULD DO GREAT

37:57.642 --> 37:57.875
THINGS.

37:57.875 --> 37:58.476
BUT IF IT'S ANYTHING LIKE MOST

37:58.476 --> 37:59.110
TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES OVER THE

37:59.110 --> 38:00.344
PAST FEW CENTURIES, UNLESS WE'RE

38:00.344 --> 38:00.978
CAREFUL, IT COULD ALSO HURT THE

38:00.978 --> 38:01.946
UNDERPRIVILEGED, ENRICH THE

38:01.946 --> 38:02.513
POWERFUL, AND WIDEN THE GAP

38:02.513 --> 38:04.749
BETWEEN THEM.

38:04.749 --> 38:06.017
THE THING IS, LIKE ANY OTHER

38:06.017 --> 38:07.585
SHINY NEW TOY, AI IS ULTIMATELY

38:07.585 --> 38:09.587
A MIRROR, AND IT'LL REFLECT BACK

38:09.587 --> 38:11.155
EXACTLY WHO WE ARE, FROM THE

38:11.155 --> 38:13.057
BEST OF US, TO THE WORST OF US,

38:13.057 --> 38:14.859
TO THE PART OF US THAT'S GAY AND

38:14.859 --> 38:24.335
HATES THE BUS.

38:24.335 --> 38:24.969
OR TO PUT EVERY THING I'VE SAID

38:24.969 --> 38:25.569
TONIGHT MUCH MORE SUCCINCTLY.

38:25.569 --> 38:25.936
KNOCK-KNOCK.

38:25.936 --> 38:26.671
WHO'S THERE?

38:26.671 --> 38:27.038
CHATGPT.

38:27.038 --> 38:27.905
CHATGPT WHO?

38:27.905 --> 38:28.606
CHATGPT CAREFUL, YOU MIGHT NOT

38:28.606 --> 38:29.006
KNOW HOW IT WORKS.

38:29.006 --> 38:29.407
EXACTLY.

38:29.407 --> 38:30.541
THAT'S OUR SHOW.

38:30.541 --> 38:31.642
THANKS SO MUCH FOR WATCHING.

38:31.642 --> 38:33.310
NOW PLEASE ENJOY A LITTLE MORE

38:33.310 --> 38:40.151
