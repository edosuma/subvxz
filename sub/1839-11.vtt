19:09.900 --> 19:10.734
WHAT A MESS.

19:10.734 --> 19:14.967
I'M GOING TO BE
TOTALLY HUMILIATED UNLESS
WE HAVE AN EXPLANATION.

19:14.967 --> 19:17.100
OR...OR...

19:17.100 --> 19:18.500
OR?

19:18.500 --> 19:20.767
WE RUN.

19:23.033 --> 19:25.400
WATCH OUT, PISTACHE!

19:33.400 --> 19:36.734
PISTACHE IS HERE!

19:36.734 --> 19:40.867
AND WHAT IS THIS?
THIS?

19:40.867 --> 19:42.300
ARE YOU HERE
TO MOCK ME?

19:42.300 --> 19:44.100
WE DON'T--
WE DON'T MOCK.

19:44.100 --> 19:46.467
NO, NO, NO.
I AM DONNA CABONNA,

19:46.467 --> 19:48.300
AND THIS IS
MY ASSISTANT RAVEN.

19:48.300 --> 19:49.100
RAVEN BAXTER. HI.

19:49.100 --> 19:53.000

HONOR YOUR GREAT GENIUS.

19:54.300 --> 19:55.600
YEAH, THAT'S
WHAT WE'RE DOING.

19:55.600 --> 19:57.367
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT WE'RE DOING.

19:57.367 --> 19:58.867
THIS, I CAN UNDERSTAND.

19:58.867 --> 20:01.734
IF I WERE NOT ME,
I WOULD WANT TO BE ME, TOO.

20:01.734 --> 20:04.300
OH,<i>TOUCHÉ.</i>

20:05.000 --> 20:06.400
OK, HERE'S THE QUESTION.

20:06.400 --> 20:08.700
HOW'D YOU MAKE IT
SO FAST FROM MILAN?

20:08.700 --> 20:12.300
OH, I CHARTERED
AN OUTRAGEOUSLY
EXPENSIVE PRIVATE JET,

20:12.300 --> 20:14.100
AND I CHARGED IT
TO MISS DONNA CABONNA.

20:14.100 --> 20:15.400
I'M SURE
SHE WOULD NOT MIND.

20:15.400 --> 20:18.967
OH, NO PROBLEM.
NO PROBLEM AT ALL.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
THIS...

20:27.000 --> 20:31.133
IS NOT JAN...
AND KVELTE.

20:31.133 --> 20:32.200
RAVEN, YOU'RE FIRED!

20:32.200 --> 20:34.000
YEAH, I KIND OF
FIGURED THAT.

20:34.000 --> 20:38.500
THEY ARE EVEN BETTER.

20:38.500 --> 20:40.200
RAVEN, YOU'RE REHIRED.

20:40.200 --> 20:41.100
SWEET.

20:41.100 --> 20:43.000
STRIKE A POSE.

20:43.500 --> 20:46.700
OK, TURN A LITTLE,
PLEASE. HERE.

20:46.700 --> 20:49.000
TURN A LITTLE MORE, PLEASE.

20:49.000 --> 20:49.767
YEAH. YEAH.

20:49.767 --> 20:51.400
TURN A LITTLE MORE, PLEASE.

20:51.400 --> 20:55.200
BUT YOU CAN'T EVEN
SEE OUR FACES.

20:55.200 --> 20:56.734
<i>EXACTEMENT.</i>

20:56.734 --> 20:59.300
THAT IS THE GENIUS OF...

20:59.300 --> 20:59.734
PISTACHE.

20:59.734 --> 21:04.500
Donna: OH, MY GOODNESS.
IT'S AMAZING. IT'S AMAZING.

21:05.200 --> 21:06.300
IT'S BRILLIANT.

21:06.300 --> 21:08.600
I DON'T NEED TO--
IT'S AMAZING.

21:10.400 --> 21:12.400
WELL, RAVEN,
THANKS TO THIS AD,

21:12.400 --> 21:16.100

21:19.400 --> 21:21.900
I THINK THIS IS GONNA WORK.

21:21.900 --> 21:24.000
I KNOW IT IS.

21:24.600 --> 21:26.300
I GOT IT.

21:26.300 --> 21:28.033
AND NOW...

21:28.033 --> 21:29.200

21:29.200 --> 21:30.900
