WEBVTT

00:43.370 --> 00:44.450
I'm ready.

00:44.910 --> 00:48.539
Hon, I know we said yes,
but I don't think this is a good idea.

00:49.460 --> 00:51.451
Was last night really an accident?

00:58.260 --> 01:00.171
--Yeah.

01:00.260 --> 01:01.807
Well, then I wanna go.

01:17.490 --> 01:20.402
Thank you. I know this is not easy.

01:22.660 --> 01:25.208
We'll, uh... we'll get some lunch.

01:27.420 --> 01:29.069
We'll get some lunch after the service.

01:29.170 --> 01:30.990
- Just not a tuna melt.
- I want a tuna melt.

01:32.040 --> 01:34.873
Whatever doctor decided mayonnaise
was bad for pregnant ladies

01:34.960 --> 01:38.134
- should have his medical license revoked.

01:41.470 --> 01:43.051
Get some rest, okay?

01:43.140 --> 01:44.425
--Okay.

01:48.520 --> 01:49.589
You about finished?

01:50.400 --> 01:51.435
Just about.

01:54.230 --> 01:55.561
Are you even a believer?

01:59.530 --> 02:00.906
I like to hear you talk.

02:23.140 --> 02:25.176
- Hi.
- HI.

02:30.100 --> 02:30.930
Hi.

02:34.690 --> 02:36.430
-Is that all for us?
-Yeah.

02:36.530 --> 02:38.521
It's heavy. It's just a few basics.

02:42.240 --> 02:43.650
How are your cousins?

02:43.740 --> 02:47.073
I made them bacon pancakes,
but they still won't eat.

02:47.500 --> 02:51.573
Been throwing rocks at that fuckin' can
for three fuckin' hours.

02:52.420 --> 02:53.626
I'll go check on them.

03:02.130 --> 03:03.711
I'll put these in some water.

03:09.850 --> 03:10.839
Ruth.

03:14.770 --> 03:15.850
Thank you.

03:22.910 --> 03:23.865
You're good.

03:29.830 --> 03:33.618
I just wanted to tell you how sorry I am
about your father and your uncle.

03:34.080 --> 03:35.331
Anything we can do...

03:37.550 --> 03:38.369
Thanks.

03:57.690 --> 03:59.851
When Jesus chose his 12 disciples,

03:59.940 --> 04:01.680
he knew that one of them was the devil...

04:02.450 --> 04:03.656
one was Judas.

04:05.160 --> 04:08.402
Yet he sat with them all
and broke bread still.

04:10.620 --> 04:12.406
So what's the Bible telling us...

04:14.080 --> 04:15.536
here? Um...

04:18.420 --> 04:20.911
Well, as a minister, it's...

04:21.760 --> 04:26.254
it's imploring me to embrace
those of you who might be...

04:27.550 --> 04:28.926
doing bad things.

04:31.180 --> 04:35.059
You have to understand
that Christ still loves you.

04:40.570 --> 04:41.935
And that you can...

04:43.650 --> 04:47.029
always change your life.
I'm here to help...

04:51.330 --> 04:52.365
I'm here to...

04:59.000 --> 04:59.989
Um...

05:02.050 --> 05:06.544
If everyone could pull their boats around,
Ash will be passing out the hymnals.

05:06.630 --> 05:08.632
We'll turn to page 24.

05:13.480 --> 05:14.799
"Do not participate..."

05:16.100 --> 05:18.512
"Do not participate
in the unfruitful deeds of darkness,

05:18.600 --> 05:19.851
but instead even expose them."

05:19.940 --> 05:22.898
"Do not participate...
in the unfruitful deeds of darkness."

05:23.440 --> 05:24.816
"Unfruitful deeds of darkness."

05:25.490 --> 05:29.529
"But instead... even expose them."

05:31.450 --> 05:35.113
The Bible says one thing,
and then it says something else.

05:35.200 --> 05:36.497
I'm failing you. I...

05:36.580 --> 05:38.741
-Preacher.
-You need to stop.

05:38.830 --> 05:41.788
I need to distribute these,
and you need to keep preaching.

05:45.050 --> 05:48.338
-Now, take--
-Don't fucking... touch me.

05:52.560 --> 05:53.675
I need to talk to Jacob.

05:57.560 --> 06:00.438
Service is_ove_r.
I'm sorry. Serwce IS over.

06:03.780 --> 06:06.146
I need to talk to Jacob.

06:13.030 --> 06:14.361
Where are the hymnals now?

06:18.670 --> 06:19.989
Preacher still with you?

06:23.170 --> 06:25.047
Give me some time, then bring him here.

06:29.550 --> 06:31.836
You were clear, and you have been patient.

08:14.240 --> 08:16.868
You've caused some upset
I had to deal with.

08:19.120 --> 08:20.235
I couldn't do it.

08:22.290 --> 08:27.410
I thought I could,
and then I saw their faces and I just...

08:31.760 --> 08:32.749
I'm sorry.

08:34.680 --> 08:38.252
I can't preach the word of the Lord,
knowing what I'm a party to.

08:38.600 --> 08:40.306
It would be a lie.

08:41.180 --> 08:42.169
I understand.

08:45.020 --> 08:47.011
We're both men of principle, you and me.

08:48.570 --> 08:50.606
Lose the power of our word, it's...

08:51.820 --> 08:53.697
it's like we lose ourselves.

08:56.240 --> 09:00.404
Ash, make sure the hymnals
are back in our possession,

09:00.490 --> 09:02.538
then we can say our goodbyes to Mr. Young.

09:03.870 --> 09:04.700
Wh...

09:06.000 --> 09:08.161
That's it? Just like that, I'm free?

09:09.250 --> 09:10.877
You were always free.

09:11.460 --> 09:12.495
But you know that.

09:16.300 --> 09:18.712
Life is all about choice.

09:22.060 --> 09:27.180
And right about now,
all either of us can do is accept that.

09:39.620 --> 09:41.906
You're getting sentimental
in your old age.

09:42.660 --> 09:44.787
I should have done this
right when we got here.

09:44.870 --> 09:45.905
Well...

09:46.000 --> 09:48.878
things weren't exactly normal
when we first got here.

09:51.210 --> 09:53.292
I guess normal is what we make it, right?

09:54.550 --> 09:55.790
Jesus.

09:56.630 --> 09:58.928
Guess I am getting sentimental
in my old age, huh?

09:59.010 --> 10:01.467
--Hello.

10:01.550 --> 10:03.882
Preacher didn't let us do our job today.

10:04.720 --> 10:06.221
Matter of conscience.

10:07.100 --> 10:09.933
Now I respect his decision,
I do, of course.

10:10.770 --> 10:12.977
He's gonna have to respect
the consequences.

10:16.490 --> 10:18.776
Uh, Jacob, I could talk to him.

10:23.870 --> 10:24.859
Grace?

10:26.620 --> 10:27.530
Grace?

10:27.620 --> 10:28.780
No more talking.

10:29.580 --> 10:32.378
Too much talk
and words lose their meaning.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.290
Hang on. Let me try.

10:36.460 --> 10:38.007
It's done, Martin.

10:38.590 --> 10:39.716
What's going on?

10:41.720 --> 10:44.132
-What's done?
-Marty...

10:45.260 --> 10:47.012
Kept my promise, plain and simple.

10:48.940 --> 10:50.180
What the fuck does that mean?

10:51.270 --> 10:53.932
Search your soul, Martin. You'll know.

11:00.610 --> 11:01.816
Jesus Christ.

11:04.410 --> 11:05.980
Life is simple, really.

11:07.160 --> 11:08.900
It's all about hard work.

11:09.710 --> 11:11.917
Honesty. Family.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.492
Words have meaning
and actions have consequences.

11:20.340 --> 11:21.796
Tell me Grace is okay.

11:23.930 --> 11:25.807
Grace is past saving, Mr. Byrde.

11:27.390 --> 11:29.426
It's your own family on the line now.

12:35.670 --> 12:38.412
I don't believe this.
Do you really think she's dead?

12:38.500 --> 12:41.913
Fuck. Last night must have spooked him,
otherwise he'd be gone.

12:42.010 --> 12:43.216
-Don't look at him, okay?
-Okay.

12:43.300 --> 12:46.508
He sees our eyes dart his way, he's just
gonna get suspicious. Look at me.

12:46.590 --> 12:48.638
Uh, you gotta get the kids
out of here. Okay?

12:49.720 --> 12:52.211
-To where?
-Anywhere. I don't care. Just away.

12:53.520 --> 12:54.726
And where are you going?

12:55.560 --> 12:57.266
I gotta get out in front of this.

12:57.350 --> 12:59.011
When it's safe to come back,
I'll call you.

12:59.110 --> 13:00.816
-All right?
-Mm-hmm. And if it's not?

13:01.570 --> 13:02.935
Then you just keep going.

13:07.320 --> 13:08.901
Oh, no, no, no. No, no hug.

13:09.700 --> 13:11.577
It's just a normal day, okay?
Husband and wife.

13:13.410 --> 13:14.991
-Right? I'll see you soon.
-Mm.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.160
Okay.

13:32.510 --> 13:33.636
I don't understand.

13:33.720 --> 13:35.267
Grab a few essentials.

13:35.350 --> 13:38.649
Just jeans, a T-shirt, a windbreaker,
and do not forget your medication.

13:39.940 --> 13:42.067
- Is this okay?
- No. No, sweetheart.

13:42.150 --> 13:45.642
No, not a suitcase. A backpack. Backpack.

13:45.740 --> 13:47.025
Where are we going?

13:47.700 --> 13:48.849
Kansas City.

13:48.950 --> 13:50.861
I don't want to go to Kansas City.

13:50.950 --> 13:54.033
No, there's a...
The Plaza's really nice there.

13:54.120 --> 13:56.497
-Is this about last night?
-We'll talk about it in the car.

13:56.580 --> 14:00.698
-I'm not going anywhere until you--
-Charlotte, just for once in your life,

14:00.790 --> 14:04.294
just once, for the love of God,
just do what the fuck I say. Okay?

14:04.380 --> 14:07.292
Go pack. Go. In a small bag.

14:07.380 --> 14:10.258
Something you can throw over your shoulder
like you're going to the mall.

14:10.760 --> 14:11.920
What about Dad?

14:25.900 --> 14:29.813
I think you might've misunderstood
this dance first time 'round.

14:31.990 --> 14:36.745
You pay a fine once.
After that, you accept the punishment.

14:37.370 --> 14:41.488
I'm not paying a fine. And I'm not
asking you for your forgiveness.

14:41.580 --> 14:44.492
I want to buy your product.
That's $300,000.

14:45.210 --> 14:48.043
That's my estimate for the street value
of what was on the boat today.

14:50.470 --> 14:51.459
Go on.

14:53.720 --> 14:56.382
I take it you don't want to go back
to your old way of distribution?

14:56.470 --> 14:57.801
Right? On land?

14:58.100 --> 15:02.139
It puts a strain on our
relationship with local law enforcement.

15:02.230 --> 15:07.429
Okay. Then if I can't solve your problem,
I'm prepared to be your sole customer.

15:08.570 --> 15:11.698
Every week. The whole load. Furthermore,

15:11.780 --> 15:16.399
I'm willing to launder the portion of
the profits that Bobby Dean used to cover.

15:20.870 --> 15:22.030
Darlene?

15:23.750 --> 15:25.832
I don't think the juice
is worth the squeeze.

15:30.590 --> 15:32.467
My wife thinks nothing's been right

15:32.550 --> 15:34.757
since you and your family
touched down here.

15:34.850 --> 15:36.306
You've cost us sleep.

15:37.430 --> 15:39.842
We've watched you a lot, Martin.
Your family.

15:40.890 --> 15:43.438
I get the feeling you know
what it's like to be...

15:43.900 --> 15:47.063
married to a woman
who's always Sitting on Impulse.

15:48.480 --> 15:51.893
What would you do if that wife
who you love and respect...

15:52.490 --> 15:56.483
felt that the smartest way to deal
with a problem was just to eliminate it?

16:00.790 --> 16:03.452
I'm a businessman. I trust the numbers.

16:05.250 --> 16:06.376
Mm-hmm.

16:07.380 --> 16:08.836
Y'all hear the bell this morning?

16:09.960 --> 16:15.296
Legend goes that when they flooded
my people out to make way for this lake,

16:15.390 --> 16:17.346
they swallowed a church up whole.

16:18.180 --> 16:20.557
You can still hear the bell
from under the water.

16:23.190 --> 16:27.809
Certain people believe it's a sign.
A call to worship.

16:28.860 --> 16:32.432
Others think it's a sign
that someone's gonna die.

16:38.160 --> 16:39.536
Today, it was both.

16:43.750 --> 16:46.036
Next time, it's up to you.

17:23.450 --> 17:27.159
Well, I think it's time to get ready

17:28.500 --> 17:31.992
To realize just what I have found

17:39.350 --> 17:40.920
-Where's your brother?
-Mom, just listen.

17:41.010 --> 17:42.420
I cannot find my keys.

17:42.510 --> 17:44.728
I'm not going anywhere without Dad.

17:45.020 --> 17:47.807
Isn't that the point
that you made in the bus station?

17:47.890 --> 17:49.437
That we stay together as a family?

17:49.520 --> 17:51.260
Yes. And we are staying together,
sweetheart.

17:51.360 --> 17:53.396
We just... We have to leave,
just for a little bit.

17:53.480 --> 17:54.856
- Without Dad?
- Well, look,

17:54.940 --> 17:58.398
I know that it sounds crazy,
but you just have to trust me.

18:06.540 --> 18:08.667
-Jonah...
-Move.

18:09.880 --> 18:12.087
Jonah, what is it?

18:12.170 --> 18:14.331
- Move!
- Honey...

18:14.420 --> 18:15.660
--Mom...

18:19.340 --> 18:20.216
Get back.

18:23.720 --> 18:26.268
So where are you going
without Marty, Wendy?

18:35.150 --> 18:37.641
That's a lot of gun for a little guy.

18:37.740 --> 18:40.447
- You need to leave.
- No.

18:41.530 --> 18:43.361
We're gonna visit for a while, right?

18:45.620 --> 18:48.407
-Get to know each other.
-Stay back!

18:51.380 --> 18:54.372
- You don't wanna shoot anybody, Jonah.
- Stop!

18:59.300 --> 19:02.679
I'm gonna take that gun from you, okay?

19:12.230 --> 19:15.267
You fucking think you're gonna kill me?
You fucking little shit! You better--

19:15.360 --> 19:17.146
- The fuck you think you're doing?

19:20.360 --> 19:22.908
You need to shut your tamale hole.

19:25.030 --> 19:27.578
Jonah, ladies, get in your car.

19:27.660 --> 19:28.740
Come on.

19:30.120 --> 19:33.624
What kind of man talks like that
to a child?

19:35.460 --> 19:37.587
You have no idea what you're doing.

19:38.840 --> 19:39.750
That so?

19:46.560 --> 19:48.130
Get in the car. In the car!

19:50.520 --> 19:52.431
Get in. Get in! Go, go, go, go, go.

19:53.730 --> 19:54.970
Get in the back.

20:17.210 --> 20:20.168
You have any idea
why I have a preacher down at my station

20:20.260 --> 20:24.583
holding a baby he's convinced that
you cut straight out of his wife's womb?

20:27.050 --> 20:28.426
I got no clue. I...

20:29.600 --> 20:31.010
barely know the man.

20:32.230 --> 20:34.266
_ Sure as hell
ain't got no quarrel with him.

20:34.980 --> 20:38.723
- Who found the body?
- Oh, we haven't found one yet.

20:38.820 --> 20:42.529
- Well, where's the crime scene?
- We don't have one.

20:43.110 --> 20:44.270
Witnesses?

20:45.610 --> 20:46.520
No, ma'am.

20:47.120 --> 20:47.984
Hmm.

20:48.450 --> 20:51.408
Don't understand it. Ain't no logic to it.

20:51.500 --> 20:56.620
Pastor Young says it's on account of him
refusing to run heroin for you.

20:58.290 --> 21:01.088
So this preacher is a drug dealer?

21:02.170 --> 21:04.923
He claims you were using him
without his knowledge.

21:05.800 --> 21:07.506
Did you smell his breath?

21:08.680 --> 21:10.466
I'd put money he was sober, ma'am.

21:10.560 --> 21:12.016
Now you listen here, John.

21:13.100 --> 21:15.933
When we planted poppies, first thing
we did was come straight to you

21:16.020 --> 21:17.681
and make_ sure there could be
no misunderstanding.

21:17.770 --> 21:20.102
-Uh-huh.
-If we were harvesting opium,

21:20.190 --> 21:22.567
we'd have to cut the flowers off
before they bloom.

21:22.650 --> 21:25.892
You see us at the market?
We sell mature plants.

21:26.660 --> 21:28.651
I checked all the local hospitals.

21:29.410 --> 21:32.618
No baby's been delivered in this area
in the last three days.

21:33.790 --> 21:37.078
Well, you got your home births,
your midwives.

21:37.670 --> 21:41.663
Now it sounds to me like this
preacher's wife abandoned their child,

21:41.750 --> 21:43.661
and now he's gone around the bend.

21:47.970 --> 21:49.847
We're talking about
a potential murder here.

21:51.050 --> 21:53.632
If you're connected in any way...

21:55.560 --> 21:57.437
it's my duty.
I'm gonna have to bring you in.

21:57.520 --> 22:00.102
Absolutely. Absolutely it is.

22:12.530 --> 22:16.284
Uh... I passed Martin Byrde
on the road coming in.

22:16.870 --> 22:19.247
So... what sort of business
you have with him?

22:19.330 --> 22:20.786
He owes us a debt.

22:22.630 --> 22:25.087
-How big?
-Bigger than yours.

22:59.670 --> 23:02.628
It was the only way. Trust me.

23:02.710 --> 23:04.792
- Where's Wendy and the kids?

23:05.590 --> 23:06.659
Where's Wendy?

23:07.460 --> 23:09.587
- Wendy!

23:11.430 --> 23:12.419
Wendy?

23:17.140 --> 23:20.052
-Hey!
-Safe. Safe. They're on the road.

23:30.900 --> 23:32.902
- What now?

23:34.740 --> 23:36.116
Wait for dark.

24:04.190 --> 24:07.819
Oh, Christ on a bike.
You don't know how to work it.

24:08.570 --> 24:13.189
Oh, good. Right, call a friend.
That won't send up any red flags.

24:13.910 --> 24:16.151
It's just... It's a YouTube...

24:16.240 --> 24:18.151
A single crematorium furnace

24:18.240 --> 24:22.199
generates temperatures between
1,600 and 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit.

24:22.290 --> 24:24.781
You were the one who said
you owned a funeral home.

24:24.880 --> 24:27.997
Yeah, because you didn't trust
dumping a body in the lake.

24:28.090 --> 24:32.129
Well, even if you puncture the lungs, they
still got a tendency to float up on you.

24:32.920 --> 24:34.638
-Is that right?
-Uh-huh.

24:35.260 --> 24:37.467
Soft tissue is vaporized, while bones...

24:37.550 --> 24:43.261
You given any thought to what you want
when you, uh... you know?

24:43.690 --> 24:45.976
Yeah. I wanna be buried, no casket.

24:46.940 --> 24:48.931
Let the worms get at my body.

24:50.190 --> 24:52.647
They'll break it down,
give back to the earth.

24:53.860 --> 24:58.274
You know, feed the flowers, the trees...

25:00.660 --> 25:01.490
Really?

25:02.580 --> 25:03.899
No, not really.

25:04.920 --> 25:06.410
What are you, soft in the head?

25:07.540 --> 25:09.952
Nobody wants to be eaten by goddamn worms.

25:10.050 --> 25:10.914
Right.

25:18.930 --> 25:21.467
That's probably my boss calling,
looking for an update.

25:22.430 --> 25:24.762
I'm guessing he'd be displeased.

25:25.480 --> 25:29.268
Yeah. You know, by shooting him,
you basically signed my death warrant.

25:31.360 --> 25:34.602
Well, remind me.
Next time, I'll let him kill your family.

25:35.570 --> 25:38.061
Um, let's just shove him in there.

25:38.160 --> 25:40.401
I'll turn this fucker up
as hot as it goes, okay?

25:53.210 --> 25:54.837
- You all right?
- Yeah.

25:56.420 --> 25:58.331
-You ready?
-Ready.

26:36.260 --> 26:37.295
Where are you?

26:37.380 --> 26:39.120
I'm home now. New plan.

26:39.220 --> 26:43.338
There's a, uh, athletic field off of I-80.

26:43.430 --> 26:46.342
Exit 112 near, uh... Morris, Illinois.

26:46.430 --> 26:49.593
I need you to be there with the kids
at 2:00 pm. Can you do that?

26:53.400 --> 26:56.062
-Wendy?
-Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

26:56.150 --> 26:57.390
Say it back to me.

26:59.070 --> 27:03.313
I-80. Exit 112. Morris, Illinois. 2:00.

27:04.490 --> 27:05.570
We'll see you there.

27:08.960 --> 27:10.860
I love you.

27:43.490 --> 27:44.775
Can I help you?

27:48.080 --> 27:49.957
How exactly did it happen?

27:52.210 --> 27:53.495
Just a freak accident.

27:54.580 --> 27:57.629
Boat must've pulled the wiring loose.
AC current leaked into the water.

28:05.350 --> 28:07.591
Are you the one who wired the dock?

28:09.350 --> 28:11.261
Uh, no, it was one of my workers.

28:14.480 --> 28:16.107
Someone you hired? Or...

28:18.150 --> 28:19.435
did Marty Byrde?

28:22.320 --> 28:23.776
Why would you ask that?

28:25.700 --> 28:28.828
Well, he's an investor here, right?

28:31.290 --> 28:34.032
Body washed up on his clock
at home, I heard.

28:36.840 --> 28:37.909
People talk.

28:38.880 --> 28:41.371
I'm sorry, you have
some kind of special interest in this?

28:41.460 --> 28:43.872
Russ Langmore was my fishing guide.

28:46.140 --> 28:47.459
He was my friend.

28:50.430 --> 28:53.137
If you thought there was
something strange going on...

28:56.350 --> 28:58.227
I'm sure there's people you could talk to.

29:10.740 --> 29:12.071
I gotta get back to work.

29:19.920 --> 29:22.832
Let's see. Heron Mills Estates...

29:22.920 --> 29:25.297
Heron Mills. Heron...

29:25.380 --> 29:29.339
Here we go. You should've just said.
That's Snell property.

29:29.890 --> 29:30.959
Yeah? Is that right?

29:31.060 --> 29:34.302
Nice people.
I buy their honey at the farmers' market.

29:34.390 --> 29:35.596
Uh, you know, if you've got it,

29:35.690 --> 29:38.557
I'd love to see maps that connect
this area with the Missouri River.

29:38.650 --> 29:40.311
So I guess as far up as Jefferson City.

29:41.020 --> 29:44.945
Of course I got 'em.
The question is, why am I getting 'em?

29:45.610 --> 29:49.398
Uh, why? Uh, my, uh...
My son's doing a research project.

29:49.490 --> 29:53.574
With, you know, connecting local rivers
and how it affects global warming.

29:53.660 --> 29:56.322
--Right. Oh, I know.

29:57.120 --> 30:00.954
Missouri River is 2,500 miles long,

30:01.040 --> 30:05.079
and you can still float an oil barge
all the way on it if you got a notion.

30:05.170 --> 30:09.129
Okay. And so that...
Okay. That's Snell's there. Yeah?

30:10.890 --> 30:15.008
Great. And you're sure
all of this is Snell property, right?

30:15.100 --> 30:18.012
Oh, it goes a heck of a ways
further than that.

30:18.100 --> 30:19.226
I'll get another map.

31:21.670 --> 31:22.659
Uh...

31:23.500 --> 31:24.990
Sorry, we're closed.

31:29.630 --> 31:31.370
I'm looking for Marty Byrde.

31:33.180 --> 31:34.590
Well, he's not here.

31:37.430 --> 31:38.670
Are you cold?

31:39.310 --> 31:40.470
You're shaking.

31:42.520 --> 31:47.184
Oh. Yeah, we had an accident
on the dock a couple nights ago,

31:47.280 --> 31:51.273
and two men died,
so I'm just a little upset.

31:57.450 --> 31:59.691
Anyway, um, you know,
we'll be open in a couple hours,

31:59.790 --> 32:02.167
if you wanna stop by then.

32:02.250 --> 32:03.911
I'll leave you to your work.

32:04.000 --> 32:04.989
Oh.

32:05.920 --> 32:08.161
Uh, should I tell Marty who stopped by?

32:10.630 --> 32:13.121
No. I'd rather surprise him.

33:28.790 --> 33:30.337
I fucking got that motherfucker.

33:30.420 --> 33:32.126
I told you,
I don't see how this works.

33:32.210 --> 33:33.666
Well, we're gonna figure it out.

33:33.760 --> 33:35.330
We don't have anything
to arrest him on.

33:35.430 --> 33:37.716
-Then we're gonna make something up.
-Are you drunk?

33:37.800 --> 33:39.347
Nope. I'm enlightened.

33:39.640 --> 33:41.096
Del Rio's got a clean sheet.

33:41.180 --> 33:44.513
That... that's why they use him to travel
back and forth. We can't touch him.

33:44.600 --> 33:46.841
Jesus, what fucking box factory
are you working in?

33:46.940 --> 33:50.762
The same one that'll take away your badge
if you try to make a bust without cause.

33:50.860 --> 33:53.021
You need to stop worrying about the law.

33:53.610 --> 33:54.520
That's a joke, right?

33:54.610 --> 33:57.943
Right now, the only things that matter
are leverage and perception.

33:58.030 --> 34:00.908
-How do you figure?
-We need to get Marty Byrde on anything,

34:00.990 --> 34:04.539
so that he knows he has no other choice
than to turn on Del Rio and the cartel.

34:04.620 --> 34:08.112
-I understand fucking leverage, Roy.
-So, perception.

34:08.210 --> 34:10.121
If we drag Del Rio in here on anything,

34:10.210 --> 34:12.292
it does not matter what it is,
it doesn't have to stick,

34:12.380 --> 34:15.793
so long as we know that he sees
that we're holding Marty Byrde, too.

34:18.840 --> 34:20.467
Then Del Rio will get spooked.

34:20.550 --> 34:23.963
Yeah. And Marty will know
he has to cooperate for protection.

34:25.020 --> 34:26.385
Otherwise, he's a dead man.

34:36.690 --> 34:39.238
- Hey, you might wanna see this.
- What happened?

34:39.320 --> 34:41.197
- Just get over here.
- What?

34:50.580 --> 34:51.740
What are you doing?

34:51.830 --> 34:55.254
Wyatt fucking Langmore,
what're you doing? What the fuck!

34:56.050 --> 34:58.962
Hey, stop it! Stop!

35:00.050 --> 35:02.757
Stop. What the fuck are you doing?
Did you hear me?

35:02.850 --> 35:05.808
-What are you doing?
-It's none of your business.

35:06.390 --> 35:09.097
-What did you say to me?
-What? None of it fits anyone,

35:09.190 --> 35:12.182
and it's too shitty for Goodwill,
so what're you getting so mad for?

35:18.740 --> 35:20.776
It might not feel like it now...

35:21.820 --> 35:24.573
but there's gonna come a day
when you're staring at a picture...

35:26.160 --> 35:27.991
of your dad wearing some...

35:28.870 --> 35:32.124
fucking stupid motorcycle T-shirt...

35:32.710 --> 35:34.871
and you're gonna wish to fucking God...

35:35.750 --> 35:40.255
that someone said to you,
"You know what? Keep that jacket.

35:41.930 --> 35:43.386
Keep that dress."

35:45.390 --> 35:49.759
'Cause right then,
all you're gonna want to do is put it on.

35:54.520 --> 35:56.727
'Cause that's the fucking
closest thing you got.

36:03.240 --> 36:05.526
Hey! Where are the guns?

36:07.370 --> 36:08.485
What are you talking about?

36:09.250 --> 36:12.242
Two handguns. They're not in the trailer,
and they're not in the truck, either.

36:20.590 --> 36:21.909
So, you're, um...

36:22.800 --> 36:25.007
you're still promising to buy us suits
for the funeral?

36:26.300 --> 36:27.130
Yeah.

36:29.310 --> 36:30.299
Okay, then.

37:45.630 --> 37:48.588
- Dad said 2:00.
- He's just late.

37:48.680 --> 37:51.843
-He's never late. It's rude.
-No, It's a long drive, sweetheart.

37:52.970 --> 37:54.016
Wendy.

38:07.070 --> 38:08.230
Marty sent me.

38:14.410 --> 38:16.537
Maybe you want the kids
to wait in the car?

38:21.840 --> 38:22.909
Is he okay?

38:24.550 --> 38:25.790
Your husband's fine.

38:26.760 --> 38:29.001
He instructed me to bring you these.

38:37.600 --> 38:41.969
There's passports,
Social Security cards, birth certificates.

38:45.150 --> 38:46.606
"Michael Fleming"?

38:47.070 --> 38:50.904
"Cindy." Are these real people?
Are... Are we stealing their identities?

38:51.820 --> 38:53.276
I don't want to be Mike Fleming.

38:53.370 --> 38:55.440
I'm afraid choosing names isn't an option.

38:56.830 --> 38:58.786
What if people call me Flem?

38:58.870 --> 39:01.873
Wendy, your license will need
to be renewed in six months.

39:01.960 --> 39:05.339
-And I'll also need your phones.
-No fucking way.

39:05.420 --> 39:06.956
-Charlotte, please.
-My life's in there.

39:07.050 --> 39:09.678
Use this until you establish
a permanent location...

39:09.760 --> 39:11.296
-Please.
-...then you can set up accounts

39:11.390 --> 39:12.505
in your new names.

39:18.100 --> 39:19.306
Please.

39:24.060 --> 39:25.891
Charlotte.

39:30.700 --> 39:31.985
How do you know my husband?

39:37.330 --> 39:39.195
He hired me a few months back.

39:41.710 --> 39:43.120
What do you do, exactly?

39:44.170 --> 39:45.910
I'm a private investigator.

39:46.960 --> 39:48.086
In Chicago.

39:51.340 --> 39:53.547
Why would Dad hire
a private investigator?

39:55.050 --> 39:56.756
What about my dad's envelope?

39:56.850 --> 39:58.715
Did... Did you send it to him already?

39:59.390 --> 40:02.052
I was only hired to create
three identities.

40:04.230 --> 40:06.767
- Mom... _
- I'll give you some privacy.

40:09.280 --> 40:10.099
Sir...

40:11.740 --> 40:13.901
did he ask you
to make these up recently or...

40:15.240 --> 40:17.788
when you were doing
your investigating in Chicago?

40:19.750 --> 40:21.741
It was after I finished my work for him.

40:22.790 --> 40:24.280
The day before you left.

40:33.550 --> 40:34.426
Ma'am.

40:40.720 --> 40:41.630
Mom...

40:42.180 --> 40:45.308
do something.
Just call him. Do something.

41:22.390 --> 41:23.596
Friends of yours?

41:26.730 --> 41:29.358
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. It's just a meeting.

41:29.650 --> 41:31.106
Enjoy your walk. It's okay.

41:33.110 --> 41:33.929
It's okay.

41:36.030 --> 41:36.906
Go on.

41:39.530 --> 41:43.990
Hey, hey! Del, it's amazing,
I was literally just about to call you.

41:44.080 --> 41:45.069
Is that so?

41:45.160 --> 41:47.162
Yeah, got the answer to all our problems.

41:48.170 --> 41:50.161
And what kind of problems
do I have, Marty?

41:50.250 --> 41:52.332
Bad choice of words.
It's just a figure of speech.

41:52.420 --> 41:53.409
No, it's a good word.

41:53.960 --> 41:54.836
Problem.

41:55.340 --> 41:58.798
What else do you call it when your trusted
lieutenant refuses to answer your calls?

42:00.890 --> 42:03.427
-Hmm?_
-What are you talking about?

42:03.930 --> 42:05.636
Where the fuck is Garcia?

42:16.650 --> 42:17.651
Hello?

42:18.360 --> 42:20.908
_ _ This is _
the Missouri Department of Corrections.

42:20.990 --> 42:24.198
- You have a collect call from...
- Cade Langmore.

42:24.870 --> 42:27.077
To accept charges, say, "Accept."

42:27.160 --> 42:29.993
To decline, say, "Decline," or hang up.

42:30.290 --> 42:31.120
Accept.

42:32.710 --> 42:33.540
Come on.

42:38.760 --> 42:39.579
Daddy?

42:41.180 --> 42:43.091
Warden just called me in.

42:44.310 --> 42:46.380
Told me my brothers were dead.

42:48.190 --> 42:49.339
That true?

42:51.980 --> 42:52.810
Yeah.

42:55.610 --> 42:57.430
Said it was some kind of accident.

42:59.740 --> 43:00.729
Um...

43:02.620 --> 43:04.781
They got electrocuted on a dock.

43:06.120 --> 43:07.701
At the Blue Cat Lodge.

43:15.090 --> 43:16.409
And Marty Byrde?

43:18.760 --> 43:20.045
How's his health?

43:24.640 --> 43:25.800
He's ﬁne.

43:31.940 --> 43:34.647
You and me are gonna talk in person.

43:35.480 --> 43:36.936
Listen, Daddy. I'm--

43:37.030 --> 43:39.100
Your call is no longer connected.

43:49.160 --> 43:51.037
Uncle Cade? How'd he take it?

43:51.670 --> 43:53.240
Who knows anything with him?

44:01.050 --> 44:02.506
I know what happened, you know.

44:04.340 --> 44:06.422
I figured it out
when the guns went missing.

44:07.810 --> 44:10.131
They weren't going to the Blue Cat
for a fucking beer.

44:10.230 --> 44:12.221
They were going to kill Charlotte's dad.

44:12.690 --> 44:13.805
At least rob him.

44:14.440 --> 44:15.759
You don't know that.

44:16.690 --> 44:20.353
What, business opportunity?
Skipping town? Not telling you?

44:21.360 --> 44:22.566
They were gonna kill him...

44:23.490 --> 44:24.650
except he got to them first.

44:26.160 --> 44:29.482
Marty Byrde doesn't have it in him
to kill someone.

44:29.580 --> 44:33.459
Not even in a chickenshit kind of way,
like a rigged dock.

44:33.540 --> 44:36.247
My guess is,
is fuckin' Boyd did some stupid shit,

44:36.340 --> 44:39.298
like hit the power cord
or some shit like that.

44:39.590 --> 44:40.500
Yeah.

44:41.300 --> 44:42.585
And the other part?

44:44.590 --> 44:45.887
I don't know. Maybe.

44:49.100 --> 44:53.309
Look... I don't want Three growing up

44:53.390 --> 44:56.359
knowing that his dad was willing
to be a murderer, okay?

45:11.700 --> 45:15.204
Listen, I've been thinking. Um...

45:15.290 --> 45:18.623
I know I'm only two years
older than you, but...

45:18.710 --> 45:21.668
And you're way fuckin' smarter than me--

45:21.760 --> 45:24.126
-No, I'm--
-No, no, just fuckin' listen.

45:24.220 --> 45:25.255
I was thinking that...

45:25.970 --> 45:31.636
maybe I could call Social Services
and see if they'd let me be your guardian.

45:32.930 --> 45:36.559
Not to, like, you know,
give you rules and shit, but...

45:38.980 --> 45:42.143
more just so
nothing can ever split us apart.

45:45.150 --> 45:47.198
I mean, would you be okay with that?

45:50.160 --> 45:52.537
Yeah. Yeah, totally.

45:59.710 --> 46:02.338
Um... what do you think?

46:07.970 --> 46:09.289
You look perfect.

46:32.530 --> 46:33.690
Where is he, Marty?

46:34.830 --> 46:36.206
I told you, I don't know.

46:41.170 --> 46:42.034
Hang on.

46:42.790 --> 46:46.669
I do not know where he is.
I do not know where he is.

46:47.590 --> 46:50.218
Del, goddamn it.
I've got no fucking idea.

46:50.300 --> 46:52.598
Hey. I have no idea where the--

46:52.680 --> 46:55.342
Goddamn it! Shit!

46:56.140 --> 46:58.847
Fuck! Motherfucker!

46:59.480 --> 47:01.471
Why would he call
and tell me there was a problem?

47:04.150 --> 47:06.687
I don't know.

47:07.360 --> 47:08.941
I've got no idea.

47:11.280 --> 47:13.271
Del... hang on!

47:13.870 --> 47:16.031
I've got no idea where Garcia is.

47:16.120 --> 47:19.362
Hang on, goddamn it!

47:19.460 --> 47:21.166
No! Fuck!

47:22.420 --> 47:24.376
Fuck!

47:24.460 --> 47:26.667
Why would I do anything to him?

47:27.550 --> 47:30.121
I finished the summer.
I got a new shipment.

47:30.220 --> 47:31.426
My life is good!

47:36.850 --> 47:38.841
Where the fuck is Garcia?

47:39.730 --> 47:40.799
I don't know.

47:41.560 --> 47:43.050
Ah! Fuck you!

47:43.150 --> 47:46.392
--Why are you taking this? Huh?

47:46.860 --> 47:50.569
Huh? We both know
that you barely made the eight million.

47:50.650 --> 47:52.402
What makes you think you can handle 50?

47:54.370 --> 47:55.655
I've got a plan.

47:56.540 --> 47:58.189
You didn't give me the details.

48:00.710 --> 48:04.999
I'm getting my fucking toenails
ripped off.

48:10.220 --> 48:12.256
You didn't give me any of the details.

48:17.470 --> 48:22.055
I knew Bruce was lying
because he finally shut his big mouth.

48:23.810 --> 48:28.315
You, when you were lying,
you talked a mile a minute.

48:30.030 --> 48:33.602
But now... you do have something.

48:34.740 --> 48:35.900
Don't you?

48:37.990 --> 48:39.901
I just need you to have an open mind.

48:41.830 --> 48:45.072
So you're looking for this fella
on behalf of the Mexican government?

48:45.170 --> 48:46.740
They're requesting extradition.

48:47.590 --> 48:50.662
This is a drunk and disorderly from 2002.

48:51.800 --> 48:52.619
Yes.

48:53.050 --> 48:56.884
So y'all must want this sucker pretty bad,
digging this deep in the trash.

48:56.970 --> 48:58.551
-We do.
-Hey, boss.

48:58.640 --> 49:00.301
Patrol car just got a hit on that plate.

49:00.390 --> 49:03.348
It's a black Suburban, heading
onto the Heron Mills Foothills Estate.

49:04.060 --> 49:05.049
All right.

49:07.270 --> 49:08.430
Heron Mills.

49:10.230 --> 49:11.276
There a problem?

49:11.860 --> 49:14.397
That's the Snell farm.
It's over 500 acres.

49:15.240 --> 49:16.867
You go in there cherries blazing,

49:16.950 --> 49:19.771
your target's likely to disappear
into the wild.

49:20.540 --> 49:22.110
You got another idea?

49:22.200 --> 49:24.327
You got a warrant to go in. I don't.

49:24.410 --> 49:26.958
But if this fella's got no reason
to be suspicious,

49:27.040 --> 49:29.247
there's only one main road in and out.

49:29.340 --> 49:30.910
So, you wait outside that,

49:31.010 --> 49:35.583
I'll provide as much backup as you need,
and he'll roll straight into your arms.

49:44.640 --> 49:47.939
Jacob, Darlene, uh...
this is, uh, Camino Del Rio.

49:48.020 --> 49:51.729
He's a representative from
the second-largest drug cartel in Mexico.

49:52.530 --> 49:53.770
Gentlemen.

49:55.320 --> 49:56.480
So precise.

49:57.160 --> 49:59.196
Always with "the second-largest."

49:59.280 --> 50:02.784
Yeah. Um... should we sit down?

50:04.500 --> 50:05.319
Uh...

50:07.620 --> 50:09.201
Darlene and Jacob...

50:10.290 --> 50:14.795
grow and control all of the heroin
in this area.

50:16.880 --> 50:18.040
Congratulations.

50:18.140 --> 50:20.540
--Hey.

50:20.640 --> 50:23.052
Jumper, get. Get!

50:23.930 --> 50:26.808
- Hey, Jumper, get.
- He's a hunting dog.

50:26.890 --> 50:29.973
He's sensitive to different smells.

50:36.400 --> 50:39.153
So, I... I am in the unique position

50:39.240 --> 50:42.482
of understanding the needs
of your operation and of your operation,

50:42.580 --> 50:43.979
and I think that what I have here

50:44.080 --> 50:46.071
is something that's...
that's mutually beneficial.

50:46.870 --> 50:50.499
Uh, they have a distribution problem,
and... and I'm proposing

50:50.580 --> 50:54.414
that the cartel becomes the sole buyer
and distributor of their product.

50:55.550 --> 50:58.257
- And why would I consider this?
- Because you...

50:58.340 --> 51:01.548
lose roughly 20% of your product
to seizure at the border.

51:02.180 --> 51:04.171
And this would offset that loss,

51:04.260 --> 51:08.299
and would also put you about seven hours
from your central hub in Chicago.

51:11.770 --> 51:15.433
And you make good money
controlling all the heroin in this area?

51:16.110 --> 51:17.486
Yes, we do.

51:20.320 --> 51:23.983
I'm sorry.
I just have no way to tell, you know?

51:24.580 --> 51:25.979
My point is...

51:26.080 --> 51:30.164
buying the product in this region
would mitigate your risk,

51:30.250 --> 51:32.320
and it would alleviate
their distribution problem.

51:34.340 --> 51:37.798
I'm a man of charity. You know this of me.

51:39.130 --> 51:42.509
But helping the less fortunate
is not my primary motivation.

51:45.970 --> 51:49.428
Sure, um... ifI may, uh...

51:50.310 --> 51:53.097
This, uh... this map here...

51:55.110 --> 51:58.022
Pardon me. Um, this here...

51:58.940 --> 52:00.601
Right there. This is your property.

52:00.700 --> 52:05.023
Okay? And the first time I came here,
you pointed out this stream right here,

52:05.120 --> 52:07.327
and I saw that it flowed west.

52:07.910 --> 52:10.367
It's curious, right? Flowing west?

52:11.330 --> 52:17.917
So, if you trace that stream
all the way here, all the way there,

52:18.000 --> 52:19.797
all the way up into Jefferson City...

52:20.760 --> 52:22.045
it hits the Missouri.

52:23.590 --> 52:25.387
That means it's not a tributary to,

52:25.470 --> 52:28.928
but is an... it's an actual branch
of the Missouri River.

52:29.020 --> 52:32.387
Missouri law states
that a riverboat casino can be built

52:32.480 --> 52:34.596
within 1,000 feet of any approved river.

52:34.690 --> 52:37.602
- The Missouri River makes that list.
- That stream ain't a river.

52:37.690 --> 52:41.979
That's true. _
But if you dam that stream right here...

52:42.740 --> 52:45.732
and you flood these three acres,
you turn it into a river,

52:45.820 --> 52:48.732
which makes it eligible to house a casino.

52:48.830 --> 52:52.789
And that's away from all of the land
that you use for your growth operation.

52:52.870 --> 52:54.667
-Flooding.
-That's right.

52:54.750 --> 52:58.789
You're aware of our family history,
how we come to be on this hill.

53:00.050 --> 53:04.168
-But_ this is three acres.
-Symbollsm matters, Mr. Byrde.

53:04.680 --> 53:09.674
Maybe not to people who have no pride,
no history. But to us.

53:10.220 --> 53:13.929
Riverboat casinos gross
nearly $90 million a month.

53:14.730 --> 53:19.178
But, besides being incredibly profitable,
a casino will be able to handle

53:19.270 --> 53:22.103
all of the money laundering needs
of your operation...

53:23.240 --> 53:24.229
and of yours.

53:25.360 --> 53:26.566
All of it.

53:27.280 --> 53:28.326
I'm afraid that...

53:29.450 --> 53:32.442
you're too stupid to understand
what it is you're suggesting.

53:51.560 --> 53:52.959
Since 1985...

53:56.020 --> 53:57.556
you have spent your profits...

53:58.810 --> 54:02.769
to buy roughly ten acres
of surrounding property every year.

54:03.530 --> 54:05.270
And you never build, right?

54:06.740 --> 54:08.150
If I had to guess,

54:08.240 --> 54:10.731
I would say that your goal
is to get some kind of leverage

54:10.830 --> 54:16.359
over that power company that displaced
your people, long ago, with that flooding.

54:19.000 --> 54:22.913
A casino will give you a lot of money.
Buy a lot of land.

54:23.000 --> 54:24.831
It would give you
a lot of political capital.

54:26.300 --> 54:28.177
You'd be able to do, in five years,

54:28.260 --> 54:31.809
what no Snell has been able to do
in the last 75.

54:48.070 --> 54:49.446
Mr. Del Rio?

54:58.540 --> 54:59.996
I need to make a phone call.

55:01.790 --> 55:02.870
Someplace private.

55:06.470 --> 55:07.459
Ash.

55:08.800 --> 55:10.836
I don't want them touching anything.

55:46.710 --> 55:47.870
I'll be right back.

55:59.310 --> 56:02.017
- Byrde residence.
- Hi, it's Wendy.

56:02.100 --> 56:03.397
Are you safe?

56:04.440 --> 56:06.260
Yeah, we're okay. I, um...

56:07.820 --> 56:09.640
I've been trying
to get in touch with Marty,

56:09.740 --> 56:11.230
and he's not answering his phone.

56:12.160 --> 56:15.527
And I... I just need to know
if he's still alive.

56:20.120 --> 56:20.950
Buddy?

56:22.370 --> 56:23.780
As far as I know.

56:24.710 --> 56:27.668
There were a couple of more Mexicans here.
He didn't want my help.

56:29.010 --> 56:30.159
He drove off with 'em.

56:30.970 --> 56:33.211
That doesn't mean he's not okay.

56:34.140 --> 56:35.334
No, of course not.

56:38.140 --> 56:39.300
Thank you.

56:41.180 --> 56:42.181
For...

56:44.060 --> 56:45.049
For everything.

56:47.690 --> 56:49.772
Well, it's just what you do.

56:56.490 --> 56:57.479
Bye, Buddy.

57:16.600 --> 57:17.749
We have a deal.

57:21.020 --> 57:22.009
Okay.

57:23.270 --> 57:25.807
I'll leave it to Marty here
to work out the details.

57:30.570 --> 57:32.777
Okay, great news. Good.

57:32.860 --> 57:36.023
I told them that there
was some dark business here.

57:36.110 --> 57:39.022
-Garcia must have gotten involved somehow.
-Hmm.

57:39.120 --> 57:41.236
He was always too ambitious.

57:41.950 --> 57:42.939
Okay.

57:43.660 --> 57:44.570
Okay.

57:45.000 --> 57:48.242
Only Marty Byrde can move to Missouri...

57:49.040 --> 57:52.419
and somehow convince me to partner
with a bunch of rednecks.

57:52.510 --> 57:54.580
--I'm sorry. What was that?

57:56.840 --> 57:59.343
I said only Marty Byrde...

58:00.050 --> 58:01.768
can somehow convince me...

58:02.640 --> 58:05.473
to partner with a bunch of red--

58:12.980 --> 58:14.481
Goddamn it, Darlene.

58:15.490 --> 58:17.151
You just cannot be doing that.

58:17.990 --> 58:20.026
I won't abide that talk. You know that.

58:21.410 --> 58:22.900
Man was a guest.

58:24.080 --> 58:26.708
Ash, get some towels, please.

58:26.790 --> 58:29.202
-He was disrespectful.
-Mm-hmm.

58:29.290 --> 58:30.370
You fucked us.

58:31.500 --> 58:34.879
Oh, you've completely fucked us.
You know that?

58:36.050 --> 58:37.756
Are you out of your goddamn minds?

58:37.840 --> 58:40.468
Huh? Are you fucking crazy?
Do you know who that guy works for?

58:40.550 --> 58:42.097
I suggest you watch your mouth,

58:42.180 --> 58:44.091
or you and her are gonna have
some discrepancies.

58:44.180 --> 58:48.844
His boss, your new partner,
is gonna be expecting him home.

58:48.940 --> 58:50.601
And when he doesn't,

58:50.690 --> 58:53.477
they'll send another Mexican
to take his place.

58:53.570 --> 58:55.777
If there's one thing Mexico is full of,
it is Mexicans.

58:57.150 --> 58:59.527
And what the fuck are we gonna say
to that guy about Del?

59:01.580 --> 59:05.994
Why would we kill someone
we'd just gone into partnership with?

59:06.080 --> 59:08.913
No logic to it... is there, Darlene?

59:10.120 --> 59:11.530
I might have overreacted.

59:12.750 --> 59:14.877
This cost me my family, you know that?

59:15.630 --> 59:17.837
This deal was done.
They could have come home.

59:17.920 --> 59:19.501
Now, there's gonna be men coming here,

59:19.590 --> 59:21.672
they're gonna be looking for answers
I can't give.

59:23.260 --> 59:26.013
They made a deal with us,
and they're gonna honor it.

59:30.650 --> 59:32.891
And we know how to look after our own.

59:34.400 --> 59:40.270
Right now, you go home, relax,
maybe get yourself a frozen custard.

59:41.660 --> 59:43.230
Me and Darlene will clean up this mess.

1:00:25.530 --> 1:00:28.488
Turn the vehicle off,
drop the keys on the ground.

1:00:28.580 --> 1:00:29.865
Open the door.

1:00:35.460 --> 1:00:37.917
Open the door. Exit the car slowly.

1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:40.002
Hands up. Hands up!

1:01:22.090 --> 1:01:23.375
On the ground.

1:01:27.970 --> 1:01:28.959
Shut 'em off.

1:01:43.820 --> 1:01:44.889
Don't you move.

1:02:02.960 --> 1:02:04.291
Where the hell is he?

1:02:05.670 --> 1:02:08.002
-Who?
-Camino Del Rio. Where the fuck is he?

1:02:08.890 --> 1:02:10.255
I don't know who that is.

1:02:13.350 --> 1:02:15.306
Get the fuck up. Get up.

1:02:22.730 --> 1:02:25.642
I've been in this car all day.
No one else has been in it.

1:02:26.200 --> 1:02:28.350
--Clear these out of here.

1:02:29.370 --> 1:02:30.564
What? Where are you going?

1:02:30.660 --> 1:02:32.867
I'm pulling this out of the way,
then I'm going up there.

1:02:32.950 --> 1:02:35.783
Yeah, no. No, I can't let you do that.

1:02:36.290 --> 1:02:37.200
You what?

1:02:37.500 --> 1:02:40.458
The warrant was to locate the car.
We found It.

1:02:42.630 --> 1:02:43.790
You're shitting me, right?

1:02:44.630 --> 1:02:47.087
I don't have probable cause to go
onto private property.

1:02:48.090 --> 1:02:51.423
I've got a witness
who saw Del Rio in this car.

1:02:55.060 --> 1:02:56.596
Can you produce him?

1:03:07.490 --> 1:03:08.855
Does that mean I can go now?

1:03:15.120 --> 1:03:16.280
You got my keys.

1:04:39.910 --> 1:04:41.400
--Hi.

1:04:45.130 --> 1:04:46.745
I was just driving by and I saw your car.

1:04:46.840 --> 1:04:50.412
I thought I'd stop in and...
and check on you guys.

1:04:55.930 --> 1:04:57.921
Heard about Grace. I'm sorry.

1:05:06.860 --> 1:05:09.317
You know, if you fold this
in a triangle...

1:05:09.860 --> 1:05:12.192
Can I show you? You can...

1:05:15.740 --> 1:05:17.822
You just put his head here.
Let me show you.

1:05:17.910 --> 1:05:19.787
-I got him.
-Yeah? Okay. Sorry.

1:05:19.870 --> 1:05:22.862
If you just put his head there
in the middle, you can... kinda...

1:05:23.920 --> 1:05:25.569
wrap this one side around him.

1:05:28.540 --> 1:05:30.246
Yep, and then bring up the bottom.

1:05:30.920 --> 1:05:34.083
Then you wrap the other side around and
tuck it in like an envelope, and...

1:05:37.260 --> 1:05:38.636
make, like, a little burrito.

1:05:45.270 --> 1:05:47.898
Oh, yeah. Come here, bubba.

1:05:47.980 --> 1:05:50.187
--Come here. Come here.

1:05:50.270 --> 1:05:54.229
Charlotte fought it at first,
but it keeps them feeling safe.

1:05:56.740 --> 1:05:59.117
The police are saying
that there's no evidence of a crime.

1:06:01.540 --> 1:06:03.496
They're acting like I'm the insane one.

1:06:07.380 --> 1:06:10.087
-What's his name?
-He doesn't have a name.

1:06:13.260 --> 1:06:15.660
Well, don't wait too long.
He's gotta hear it.

1:06:17.590 --> 1:06:20.047
Why would I want to keep
a baby alive in this world?

1:06:26.770 --> 1:06:29.648
Because kids are hope. Hmm?

1:06:32.400 --> 1:06:35.892
You know, that...
that maybe things can get better.

1:06:40.910 --> 1:06:42.480
You know, I had this, uh...

1:06:42.580 --> 1:06:45.902
faith that getting shot and surviving
meant that there was a God.

1:06:48.040 --> 1:06:51.919
It was Grace who told me
how naive I was and that...

1:06:53.000 --> 1:06:54.877
all it meant was that shit happens.

1:06:56.970 --> 1:06:58.369
Sometimes we get lucky.

1:07:02.010 --> 1:07:04.092
- Yeah.
- You don't believe that, do you?

1:07:06.770 --> 1:07:07.759
Uh...

1:07:09.730 --> 1:07:11.266
No, you're right.

1:07:14.280 --> 1:07:15.770
There's gotta be a God.

1:07:19.950 --> 1:07:21.406
'Cause there's a devil.

1:07:23.620 --> 1:07:25.611
I think you're the fucking devil.

1:08:03.030 --> 1:08:04.486
- Okay?

1:08:04.580 --> 1:08:06.024
- I'm serious.
- Yeah.

1:08:09.290 --> 1:08:12.623
Hi. Please tell me you're okay.

1:08:12.710 --> 1:08:15.372
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm sorry that I haven't called.

1:08:15.460 --> 1:08:17.701
No, it's...
It doesn't matter. It's okay.

1:08:18.380 --> 1:08:19.870
Look, we'll come straight home.

1:08:19.970 --> 1:08:21.540
Uh, Wendy, you can't.

1:08:23.180 --> 1:08:27.549
You were right. Um, it's...
it's never gonna be safe here.

1:08:28.680 --> 1:08:29.669
Okay?

1:08:30.390 --> 1:08:31.800
Then you come to us.

1:08:35.690 --> 1:08:37.260
I don't think I can.

1:08:37.690 --> 1:08:41.774
I think if I do that...
they'll never stop looking.

1:08:45.070 --> 1:08:46.059
You know?

1:08:52.370 --> 1:08:56.409
Um, I saw Mason's baby today.

1:08:56.750 --> 1:09:00.083
He's healthy. He's perfect.

1:09:01.630 --> 1:09:03.257
There has to be a solution here.

1:09:05.510 --> 1:09:07.501
Yeah, there is. You're doing it.

1:09:12.890 --> 1:09:14.346
You want to talk to the kids?

1:09:19.900 --> 1:09:20.889
No.

1:09:25.110 --> 1:09:28.773
I think if...
if I hear their voices it's, um...

1:09:33.160 --> 1:09:34.161
You know.

1:09:35.540 --> 1:09:37.030
Maybe I'll try you tomorrow.

1:09:40.550 --> 1:09:42.506
I am so sorry I hurt you, Marty.

1:09:47.090 --> 1:09:48.887
I should never have done that.

1:09:51.560 --> 1:09:54.347
It's not your fault.
I was just shut down, you know?

1:10:02.990 --> 1:10:04.309
I don't wanna hang up.

1:10:24.670 --> 1:10:25.876
Was that Dad?

1:10:29.930 --> 1:10:32.171
Was it?
Nobody else would have that number.

1:10:32.930 --> 1:10:33.919
Is he okay?

1:10:35.100 --> 1:10:36.340
Are we going home?

1:10:42.400 --> 1:10:45.142
-We're trying to keep you safe.
-So that's a no. We're not going home.

1:10:45.240 --> 1:10:46.730
Your father and I
made this decision together.

1:10:46.820 --> 1:10:48.060
So let me talk to him.

1:10:48.160 --> 1:10:50.367
Charlotte, give me the keys.

1:10:50.450 --> 1:10:52.327
Is it unsafe there right now?
Right this second?

1:10:52.410 --> 1:10:53.786
Honestly, I do not know.

1:10:56.330 --> 1:10:58.491
Look, I know you're just trying
to take us somewhere safe,

1:10:58.580 --> 1:11:00.070
but that place doesn't exist.

1:11:00.920 --> 1:11:03.582
I mean, we should at least stay together.

1:11:03.670 --> 1:11:07.504
We won't even know where _to turn
once we get out of this parking lot.

1:11:07.590 --> 1:11:10.798
I mean, we'll just be driving.
We've been driving for days.

1:11:12.470 --> 1:11:14.961
How are you silent back there?
Just say something!

1:11:19.600 --> 1:11:21.227
I don't want to be Mike Fleming.

1:11:21.940 --> 1:11:23.180
It's just a name, sweetheart.

1:11:23.270 --> 1:11:25.022
I'm old enough to decide for myself.

1:11:25.110 --> 1:11:26.099
That's not what I meant.

1:11:26.190 --> 1:11:27.771
I'm not some little girl, you know?

1:11:30.160 --> 1:11:33.118
I've done things
that you have no idea about.

1:11:37.500 --> 1:11:41.072
You made us adults the second
you told us about what Dad was doing.

1:11:42.590 --> 1:11:44.626
You can't take it all back now.

1:11:49.970 --> 1:11:51.926
I meant, I don't want Jonah to die.

1:11:56.770 --> 1:11:57.725
What do you mean?

1:11:59.140 --> 1:12:01.142
Well, the second I become Mike Fleming...

1:12:02.900 --> 1:12:04.720
that means Jonah Byrde is dead.

1:12:10.400 --> 1:12:11.856
I don't want him to be dead.

1:14:27.330 --> 1:14:28.319
Hey.

1:15:34.820 --> 1:15:35.809
You ready?

1:15:37.990 --> 1:15:38.979
Yep.

1:15:45.410 --> 1:15:47.992
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

1:16:04.430 --> 1:16:06.216
--Hello?

1:16:13.230 --> 1:16:14.561
- Dad?
- Dad!
