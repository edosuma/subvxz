WEBVTT

00:17.476 --> 00:18.226
(elevator dings)

00:22.356 --> 00:23.524
Hey, Schwoz, look!

00:23.565 --> 00:24.984
I made onion dip!

00:25.024 --> 00:26.944
There's no time for onion dip.

00:26.986 --> 00:27.862
Why not?

00:27.903 --> 00:29.363
Something bad has happened.

00:29.864 --> 00:31.949
Aw, did Gooch fall

00:29.864 --> 00:31.949
in the toilet again?

00:33.200 --> 00:35.494
No, Gooch did not fall

00:33.200 --> 00:35.494
into the toilet again.

00:36.203 --> 00:37.078
Then what is--

00:37.120 --> 00:38.497
(alarm beeping)

00:42.209 --> 00:43.878
Hey! Do you like onion dip?

00:44.461 --> 00:45.337
- Wait a minute!

00:47.965 --> 00:48.883
(remote beeps)

00:50.425 --> 00:51.301
How is Henry?

00:51.343 --> 00:52.511
He's sound asleep!

00:52.553 --> 00:53.971
- Oh no, bring him!

00:54.013 --> 00:55.931
We have to hook him up

00:54.013 --> 00:55.931
to the thingy!

00:56.598 --> 00:57.683
- What's wrong with Henry?

00:58.308 --> 00:59.810
We were trying

00:58.308 --> 00:59.810
to capture Dr. Minyak.

00:59.852 --> 01:01.812
Dr. Minyak broke out of prison?

01:01.854 --> 01:03.731
Yeah. And just as we were

01:01.854 --> 01:03.731
about to grab him,

01:03.772 --> 01:05.691
he blasted Henry

01:03.772 --> 01:05.691
with a dream beam.

01:05.733 --> 01:07.192
A dream beam? What is--

01:07.234 --> 01:08.694
There's no time for you

01:07.234 --> 01:08.694
to finish that question!

01:08.736 --> 01:10.237
(laughs)

01:10.278 --> 01:12.155
Schwoz, can you show us

01:10.278 --> 01:12.155
Henry's brain activity?

01:12.197 --> 01:13.782
- Yeah, hang on.

01:12.197 --> 01:13.782
I got to change the input.

01:14.157 --> 01:15.367
HDMI one.

01:15.743 --> 01:18.286
- No. HDMI two.

01:15.743 --> 01:18.286
- Oh, my God.

01:18.328 --> 01:19.580
Oh. There.

01:19.872 --> 01:21.206
That is Henry's brain.

01:21.582 --> 01:23.584
Okay,

01:21.582 --> 01:23.584
I will give anyone two dollars

01:23.625 --> 01:24.752
to tell me what's going on.

01:26.169 --> 01:28.463
Henry got blasted

01:26.169 --> 01:28.463
with a dream beam.

01:29.757 --> 01:30.925
(laughs)

01:31.299 --> 01:32.551
And it put him

01:31.299 --> 01:32.551
into a deep sleep.

01:32.843 --> 01:34.093
Very deep.

01:34.135 --> 01:35.679
Well, then let's wake him up.

01:35.721 --> 01:36.847
It's almost impossible

01:36.889 --> 01:38.181
to wake up someone

01:36.889 --> 01:38.181
who's been dream beamed.

01:38.223 --> 01:39.182
(Charlotte)

01:38.223 --> 01:39.182
Why?

01:39.224 --> 01:40.350
Show her, Schwoz.

01:43.896 --> 01:44.813
- Wake up!

01:45.731 --> 01:46.774
Wake up!

01:46.815 --> 01:47.649
Wake up!

01:47.691 --> 01:48.483
Wake up!

01:49.068 --> 01:49.944
Wake up! Wake up!

01:52.029 --> 01:53.196
You see?

01:53.238 --> 01:54.322
Oh my God.

01:54.782 --> 01:56.450
And as long as he's

01:54.782 --> 01:56.450
in this type of deep sleep...

01:58.035 --> 01:58.911
He'll have dreams.

01:59.703 --> 02:00.537
Dreams?

02:00.579 --> 02:01.705
Disturbing dreams.

02:02.122 --> 02:03.457
Crazy dreams.

02:03.498 --> 02:04.833
(laughs)

02:04.875 --> 02:06.126
Oh, man.

02:06.167 --> 02:07.753
(Henry moaning)

02:08.587 --> 02:10.047
I wonder what he's

02:08.587 --> 02:10.047
dreaming about.

02:10.464 --> 02:12.257
(Schowz)

02:10.464 --> 02:12.257
Watch the screen

02:10.464 --> 02:12.257
and you will see.

02:19.014 --> 02:19.932
(sighs)

02:20.432 --> 02:22.059
(Jasper)

02:20.432 --> 02:22.059
Henry!

02:22.101 --> 02:23.477
Oh, hey, what's up, Jasp--

02:27.106 --> 02:28.774
Henry, I'm late.

02:28.816 --> 02:29.900
Will you take me to the church?

02:31.443 --> 02:32.736
Why are you wearing

02:31.443 --> 02:32.736
a wedding dress?

02:33.112 --> 02:34.655
Oh, no, no.

02:34.696 --> 02:35.697
What?

02:35.739 --> 02:37.532
Green dancey girl.

02:43.831 --> 02:44.873
What the heck is--

02:44.915 --> 02:46.000
Don't let her stop

02:44.915 --> 02:46.000
the wedding.

02:46.416 --> 02:48.209
Please.

02:46.416 --> 02:48.209
Don't let the green dancey girl

02:48.251 --> 02:49.210
stop the wedding.

02:49.837 --> 02:51.713
Aah!

02:56.551 --> 02:58.261
(music)

03:00.179 --> 03:01.098
Hello...

03:02.181 --> 03:03.100
Miss.

03:06.561 --> 03:07.270
Why are you green?

03:07.312 --> 03:08.897
(laughs)

03:08.939 --> 03:09.940
Henry!

03:09.982 --> 03:11.150
Hey, Miss Shapen.

03:11.190 --> 03:12.693
Do you know

03:11.190 --> 03:12.693
why that green girl is dancing--

03:12.734 --> 03:14.903
You are in big trouble.

03:15.946 --> 03:17.280
Why?

03:17.322 --> 03:19.074
My cat hasn't gone

03:17.322 --> 03:19.074
to the bathroom in a week.

03:19.116 --> 03:20.742
(laughs)

03:20.784 --> 03:22.870
And how am I responsible

03:20.784 --> 03:22.870
for that?

03:22.911 --> 03:25.539
I think George Clooney

03:22.911 --> 03:25.539
might be involved.

03:26.581 --> 03:27.248
George Clooney?

03:27.290 --> 03:28.083
Yes.

03:29.501 --> 03:31.336
What's wrong with my cat?

03:32.379 --> 03:33.421
Tell us.

03:33.463 --> 03:35.215
Tell our eyes.

03:35.256 --> 03:36.925
Don't yell at Henry.

03:36.967 --> 03:38.635
You can't tell me what to do.

03:38.677 --> 03:40.470
Shut up, right eye.

03:41.221 --> 03:42.347
What's going on?

03:42.389 --> 03:45.184
Oh, Henry, you're so funny.

03:45.517 --> 03:47.268
You make us laugh.

03:47.310 --> 03:48.812
Let us laugh now.

03:48.854 --> 03:51.356
(laughing)

03:52.273 --> 03:53.984
But I didn't say anything funny.

03:54.526 --> 03:56.319
♪ Row row row your cat ♪

03:56.361 --> 03:58.238

04:05.954 --> 04:07.081

04:08.665 --> 04:10.084
How do you row a cat?

04:10.918 --> 04:12.753
Why are you green and dancing?

04:13.712 --> 04:15.047
Why?

04:15.547 --> 04:18.842
(Jasper)

04:15.547 --> 04:18.842
Aah!

04:20.052 --> 04:21.511
(Schwoz)

04:20.052 --> 04:21.511
Look at his brain waves.

04:21.970 --> 04:23.638
He must be having

04:21.970 --> 04:23.638
an insane dream.

04:24.431 --> 04:25.682
Man...

04:25.724 --> 04:27.601
I sure picked the wrong day

04:25.724 --> 04:27.601
to make onion dip.

04:34.315 --> 04:35.525
It all just kind of happened.

04:35.567 --> 04:37.569
My dad was

04:35.567 --> 04:37.569
an irresponsible scientist.

04:38.319 --> 04:39.988
I wanted an after-school job.

04:40.030 --> 04:42.282
(Captain Man)

04:40.030 --> 04:42.282
And by accident,

04:40.030 --> 04:42.282
he made me indestructible.

04:42.323 --> 04:43.951
Ah!

04:43.992 --> 04:45.660
(Henry)

04:43.992 --> 04:45.660
I went into this crazy store

04:46.078 --> 04:48.163
and met

04:46.078 --> 04:48.163
a pretty interesting guy.

04:48.205 --> 04:49.248
I'm going to blow your mind.

04:50.082 --> 04:52.333
(Captain Man)

04:50.082 --> 04:52.333
Now I protect

04:50.082 --> 04:52.333
the good citizens of Swellview

04:52.375 --> 04:53.334
who call me...

04:53.376 --> 04:54.461
(Henry)

04:53.376 --> 04:54.461
And he turned out to be...

04:54.502 --> 04:55.462
(Captain Man)

04:54.502 --> 04:55.462
You know the name.

04:55.503 --> 04:57.589
Captain Man!That's right, Henry.

04:57.631 --> 05:00.383
(Captain Man)

04:57.631 --> 05:00.383
In time, I realized

04:57.631 --> 05:00.383
that being a superhero

05:00.425 --> 05:01.718
is a lot to handle alone.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.095
He wanted some help.

05:03.137 --> 05:04.554
(Captain Man)

05:03.137 --> 05:04.554
I needed a sidekick.

05:04.596 --> 05:06.140
(Henry)

05:04.596 --> 05:06.140
I, Henry hart...

05:06.181 --> 05:07.474
(Captain Man)

05:06.181 --> 05:07.474
Pledge to never ever ever...

05:06.181 --> 05:07.474
tell anyone...

05:07.515 --> 05:09.851
That I'm Captain Man's

05:07.515 --> 05:09.851
It is done.ecret sidekick.

05:09.893 --> 05:11.561
(Henry)

05:09.893 --> 05:11.561
Now we blow bubbles.

05:11.603 --> 05:12.854
(Captain Man)

05:11.603 --> 05:12.854
And fight crime.

05:12.896 --> 05:13.855
(Henry)

05:12.896 --> 05:13.855
Feels good.

05:15.023 --> 05:19.945
(music)

05:28.411 --> 05:30.497
Up the tube!

05:31.539 --> 05:32.540
(Henry)

05:31.539 --> 05:32.540
Oh, my boot.

05:32.791 --> 05:34.001
(Captain Man)

05:32.791 --> 05:34.001
Ha!

05:39.047 --> 05:40.465
All right,

05:40.507 --> 05:42.383
now that we've put Henry

05:40.507 --> 05:42.383
back into his normal clothes,

05:44.178 --> 05:45.386
we're going to try

05:44.178 --> 05:45.386
something drastic.

05:45.428 --> 05:46.763
Ooh, what?

05:46.805 --> 05:48.682
Waking Henry up

05:46.805 --> 05:48.682
by giving him a massive dose

05:48.723 --> 05:49.975
of extreme coffee.

05:51.893 --> 05:54.980
But I thought extreme coffee

05:51.893 --> 05:54.980
was illegal in America.

05:55.438 --> 05:56.397
It is.

05:56.773 --> 05:58.357
And for good reason.

05:58.399 --> 06:00.568
It has over 300 times

05:58.399 --> 06:00.568
the caffeine of normal coffee.

06:01.486 --> 06:02.821
- Okay.

06:02.863 --> 06:05.157
We're ready to pump

06:02.863 --> 06:05.157
the extreme coffee into Henry.

06:05.699 --> 06:06.700
Do it.

06:07.201 --> 06:09.077
- Let's hope this works.

06:07.201 --> 06:09.077
- (Schwoz) Yeah.

06:09.119 --> 06:09.995
(machine beeping)

06:17.336 --> 06:18.586
(Charlotte)

06:17.336 --> 06:18.586
Hey.

06:18.628 --> 06:20.797
Why are we injecting

06:18.628 --> 06:20.797
the coffee into his feet?

06:20.839 --> 06:22.674
Because the fastest way

06:20.839 --> 06:22.674
to get the coffee

06:22.716 --> 06:24.968
into his heart is

06:22.716 --> 06:24.968
through intra-feetus injection.

06:26.970 --> 06:27.971
Where do you learn this stuff?

06:31.016 --> 06:31.933
Is Henry waking up?

06:33.018 --> 06:34.353
I don't think so.

06:34.393 --> 06:35.103
- Aah.

06:35.854 --> 06:37.939
- But the coffee does seem to be

06:35.854 --> 06:37.939
affecting Henry's dream.

06:42.027 --> 06:45.155
(screaming)

07:04.299 --> 07:05.842
I feel so bad for Henry.

07:06.551 --> 07:07.510
(Ray)

07:06.551 --> 07:07.510
Yeah.

07:11.890 --> 07:13.308
Henry...

07:13.892 --> 07:15.102
Wake up.

07:15.560 --> 07:17.312
I made my homemade onion dip.

07:33.161 --> 07:34.329
Please wake up.

07:38.458 --> 07:39.376
Hey...

07:40.919 --> 07:42.087
You're just smearing

07:40.919 --> 07:42.087
the dip on his lips.

07:42.129 --> 07:43.213
I know.

07:45.090 --> 07:45.882
Aah!

07:45.924 --> 07:46.841
Aah.

07:47.592 --> 07:48.676
What, Schwoz?

07:49.552 --> 07:51.471
Maybe we cannot wake up Henry

07:51.512 --> 07:53.473
by doing things to him

07:51.512 --> 07:53.473
on the outside...

07:53.890 --> 07:54.849
Yeah.

07:54.891 --> 07:55.809
So...

07:56.268 --> 07:59.396
Let's try to wake him up

07:56.268 --> 07:59.396
from inside his dream.

08:00.897 --> 08:01.689
(both)

08:00.897 --> 08:01.689
What?

08:05.568 --> 08:07.612
But I don't understand

08:05.568 --> 08:07.612
what I'm supposed to do.

08:07.654 --> 08:09.114
We will explain.

08:09.156 --> 08:12.159
All right, see, Henry is trapped

08:09.156 --> 08:12.159
in a dream state.

08:12.200 --> 08:13.618
Right, I get that.

08:13.660 --> 08:14.995
And according

08:13.660 --> 08:14.995
to Schwoz's theory,

08:15.036 --> 08:16.204
we might be able

08:15.036 --> 08:16.204
to wake Henry up

08:16.246 --> 08:17.580
from inside his dream.

08:18.123 --> 08:18.999
I don't get that.

08:20.334 --> 08:22.461
We are going

08:20.334 --> 08:22.461
to make you go to sleep.

08:22.502 --> 08:23.920
And then using that machine

08:23.962 --> 08:26.006
we can connect your sleeping

08:23.962 --> 08:26.006
brain waves with Henry's.

08:26.047 --> 08:28.925
And put you

08:26.047 --> 08:28.925
inside Henry's dream.

08:29.926 --> 08:32.387
And you guys know for sure

08:29.926 --> 08:32.387
that this isn't dangerous?

08:33.680 --> 08:34.722
Sure, sure.

08:36.099 --> 08:37.809
Then how come one of you guys

08:37.851 --> 08:39.978
don't transport yourselves

08:37.851 --> 08:39.978
into Henry's dream?

08:40.354 --> 08:41.521
Well...

08:41.562 --> 08:43.148
I have a peanut allergy.

08:44.399 --> 08:45.775
I had some onion dip.

08:47.986 --> 08:48.903
Mm-hmm.

08:49.696 --> 08:50.947
Now, listen, Charlotte,

08:50.989 --> 08:52.157
when you're

08:50.989 --> 08:52.157
inside Henry's dream,

08:52.199 --> 08:53.825
you can never tell Henry

08:52.199 --> 08:53.825
that he's dreaming.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.118
Do not tell Henry that.

08:55.702 --> 08:56.703
Why not?

08:57.162 --> 08:58.372
Because when you're

08:57.162 --> 08:58.372
inside someone's dream

08:58.413 --> 08:59.622
and you tell them

08:58.413 --> 08:59.622
that they're dreaming,

08:59.664 --> 09:01.624
it can cause the dreamer

08:59.664 --> 09:01.624
to go into brain shock.

09:01.666 --> 09:03.918
His brain could

09:01.666 --> 09:03.918
literally explode.

09:04.627 --> 09:05.753
Well, what about me?

09:06.087 --> 09:07.130
Could my brain explode?

09:07.672 --> 09:08.798
What time is it?

09:11.092 --> 09:14.262
All right, well, what do I do

09:11.092 --> 09:14.262
when I'm inside his dream?

09:14.721 --> 09:16.597
Well,

09:14.721 --> 09:16.597
according to the Internet...

09:17.765 --> 09:19.142
"When a person

09:17.765 --> 09:19.142
is in a dream state,

09:19.184 --> 09:20.519
one of the most common

09:19.184 --> 09:20.519
ways to wake up

09:20.560 --> 09:21.811
is by experiencing pain."

09:22.187 --> 09:23.104
Pain.

09:24.231 --> 09:25.773
But I don't want to hurt Henry.

09:26.066 --> 09:27.317
You won't be hurting him.

09:27.859 --> 09:28.943
The real Henry is right here.

09:28.985 --> 09:30.904
You'll only be

09:28.985 --> 09:30.904
hurting dream Henry.

09:30.945 --> 09:31.988
It won't be real.

09:32.864 --> 09:35.033
Okay.

09:32.864 --> 09:35.033
And how do I talk to you guys?

09:35.075 --> 09:37.911
We're going to put Henry's

09:35.075 --> 09:37.911
Whiz watch on your wrist.

09:37.952 --> 09:40.747
So if you need to talk to us

09:37.952 --> 09:40.747
while you're in Henry's dream,

09:41.122 --> 09:42.082
you use the watch.

09:42.707 --> 09:44.501
You know, when I took this job,

09:44.543 --> 09:46.127
we did not talk

09:44.543 --> 09:46.127
about stuff like this.

09:46.961 --> 09:47.962
You'll be fine.

09:48.922 --> 09:51.049
Well, I feel like I should

09:48.922 --> 09:51.049
get a bonus or something.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.052
Charlotte,

09:54.094 --> 09:55.929
if we don't wake Henry

09:54.094 --> 09:55.929
out of the dream state soon,

09:56.971 --> 09:58.139
he could be trapped

09:56.971 --> 09:58.139
in there forever.

10:00.308 --> 10:01.768
Okay. But before I go...

10:02.143 --> 10:03.019
What?

10:04.020 --> 10:05.188
One more chip and dip.

10:05.230 --> 10:07.148
(laughs)

10:12.529 --> 10:13.863
Okay. Let's get this going.

10:20.870 --> 10:21.913
You really think

10:20.870 --> 10:21.913
it's going to work?

10:21.955 --> 10:23.290
I don't know.

10:25.333 --> 10:26.626
Sweet dreams, Charlotte.

10:26.667 --> 10:28.753
And remember, hurt Henry.

10:29.796 --> 10:31.506
It could be our only chance

10:29.796 --> 10:31.506
to wake him up.

10:35.594 --> 10:37.971
(Charlotte screaming)

10:44.436 --> 10:45.353
Hey.

10:46.729 --> 10:48.398
Charlotte. How'd you get here?

10:48.982 --> 10:50.525
I don't care.

10:50.567 --> 10:51.485
Good.

10:52.444 --> 10:53.361
I'm just glad to see you.

10:53.903 --> 10:55.071
Why?

10:55.113 --> 10:57.282
Anything strange going on?

10:58.241 --> 10:59.200
Everything.

10:59.242 --> 11:01.161
I had the weirdest

10:59.242 --> 11:01.161
day at school.

11:01.202 --> 11:03.704
And then I come home

11:01.202 --> 11:03.704
and it's even weirder here.

11:04.456 --> 11:05.665
What's so weird?

11:06.082 --> 11:08.709
Well, for one thing, my parents.

11:08.751 --> 11:10.711
For some reason,

11:08.751 --> 11:10.711
they look and sound different.

11:11.045 --> 11:12.130
Like Kim and Kanye.

11:17.552 --> 11:18.428
Hi, Charlotte!

11:18.470 --> 11:19.429
I'm a genius!

11:21.722 --> 11:23.099
Cool.

11:24.518 --> 11:26.561
Why do my parents look and sound

11:24.518 --> 11:26.561
like Kim and Kanye?

11:27.686 --> 11:29.981
Do they?

11:27.686 --> 11:29.981
I didn't notice.

11:31.358 --> 11:34.027
Well, maybe you'll notice

11:31.358 --> 11:34.027
that Piper has a beard,

11:34.068 --> 11:35.403
and she's playing the lute.

11:40.200 --> 11:43.702
♪ I gave my love a chicken ♪

11:44.162 --> 11:47.582
♪ That had no face ♪

11:49.917 --> 11:51.336
Why is she singing that?

11:51.670 --> 11:52.546
I really--

11:52.587 --> 11:53.963
All chickens have faces.

11:54.839 --> 11:57.467
- So, maybe--

11:54.839 --> 11:57.467
- Oh, and did you see Jasper?

12:00.387 --> 12:03.097
Henry, will you please help me

12:00.387 --> 12:03.097
get back on my body?

12:04.391 --> 12:05.933
Hey! Come back!

12:06.309 --> 12:07.644
I thought we were a team!

12:09.563 --> 12:10.647
Did you see that?

12:11.939 --> 12:14.401
I feel like I'm in some weird,

12:11.939 --> 12:14.401
freaky dream.

12:14.442 --> 12:15.318
You're not!

12:16.695 --> 12:17.696
Huh?

12:17.736 --> 12:18.863
You're not having a dream.

12:19.406 --> 12:21.032
Just go upstairs

12:21.074 --> 12:22.992
and try to put Jasper's head

12:21.074 --> 12:22.992
back on his body.

12:24.202 --> 12:25.119
Okay.

12:25.828 --> 12:26.705
That makes sense.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.250
(Henry)

12:29.082 --> 12:30.250
Jasper!

12:30.291 --> 12:31.376
I don't know what you think

12:30.291 --> 12:31.376
you're doing,

12:31.418 --> 12:33.086
but it's not natural!

12:35.589 --> 12:36.548
Ray!

12:37.798 --> 12:39.551
Charlotte! Did you find Henry?

12:39.593 --> 12:40.759
Yeah.

12:40.801 --> 12:42.095
I'm inside of his dream.

12:42.136 --> 12:43.762
Ooh, what's it like?

12:43.804 --> 12:44.805
Weird.

12:45.139 --> 12:46.140
Well, how weird?

12:46.474 --> 12:47.892
You really need a number?

12:48.518 --> 12:49.936
Yes. From one to ten.

12:50.270 --> 12:51.563
Hang on, let me check.

12:58.278 --> 12:59.696
Who's a good beard?

13:00.238 --> 13:02.323
You are. Yes you are.

13:02.365 --> 13:04.576
(laughs)

13:04.618 --> 13:06.494
(Henry)

13:04.618 --> 13:06.494
Jasper! Get back on your body!

13:06.536 --> 13:07.287
Jasper!

13:09.748 --> 13:11.583
I'm over here.

13:09.748 --> 13:11.583
Oh, oh, can't catch me.

13:11.625 --> 13:13.876
Hey, no. Jasper!

13:13.918 --> 13:14.961
See you.

13:15.002 --> 13:16.379
Can somebody stop Jasper's head?

13:19.758 --> 13:20.717
52.

13:20.759 --> 13:22.677
(laughs)

13:26.306 --> 13:27.682
Ray...

13:27.724 --> 13:29.934
Just tell me what to do

13:27.724 --> 13:29.934
so you and Schwoz can wake me up

13:29.976 --> 13:31.645
and bring me back home.

13:31.686 --> 13:33.438
Okay, first, you got to remember

13:33.480 --> 13:36.441
the world you're in

13:33.480 --> 13:36.441
with Henry is not real.

13:37.400 --> 13:39.235
You're both just in a crazy

13:37.400 --> 13:39.235
weird dream state.

13:40.445 --> 13:41.904
Yeah, no kidding.

13:41.946 --> 13:43.490
Hey, who are you talking to?

13:43.531 --> 13:44.991
Get out of here, Jasper's head.

13:45.659 --> 13:46.909
(whistles)

13:46.951 --> 13:48.703
Yeah, I'm back.

13:46.951 --> 13:48.703
What?

13:48.745 --> 13:50.037
You got to go hurt Henry.

13:51.331 --> 13:52.332
But I--

13:52.373 --> 13:53.625
It's okay.

13:54.167 --> 13:56.628
You're in a dream.

13:54.167 --> 13:56.628
Nothing is real.

13:57.044 --> 13:57.962
There's nothing

13:57.044 --> 13:57.962
to get hung about.

14:00.089 --> 14:01.924
Now, go hurt Henry and hopefully

14:00.089 --> 14:01.924
that'll wake him up.

14:02.425 --> 14:03.968
All right,

14:04.010 --> 14:06.179
but you and Schwoz better not be

14:04.010 --> 14:06.179
eating my onion dip without me.

14:07.054 --> 14:09.683
We're not.

14:07.054 --> 14:09.683
Now, you know what to do.

14:09.724 --> 14:11.142
Right.

14:20.485 --> 14:21.444
Hi, Piper!

14:22.570 --> 14:25.948
There's a river of glue

14:22.570 --> 14:25.948
and apple juice, too.

14:28.326 --> 14:29.076
Okay.

14:41.172 --> 14:41.922
Henry!

14:41.964 --> 14:42.757
(Henry)

14:41.964 --> 14:42.757
What?

14:42.799 --> 14:44.425
Henry, come quick!

14:44.467 --> 14:45.677
Hurry!

14:45.719 --> 14:47.345
Charlotte, here I come!

14:47.387 --> 14:48.221
What's wr--

14:56.771 --> 14:57.814
(Charlotte)

14:56.771 --> 14:57.814
Hi.

14:58.898 --> 14:59.774
What just happened?

14:59.816 --> 15:01.025
You fell down the stairs.

15:01.067 --> 15:01.860
Oh.

15:01.901 --> 15:02.527
Did it hurt?

15:02.569 --> 15:03.653
Yeah, a lot.

15:03.695 --> 15:04.487
Cool, wait here.

15:07.990 --> 15:09.158
That also hurt!

15:10.535 --> 15:11.369
Ray!

15:12.620 --> 15:14.038
Hi. Did you hurt Henry?

15:14.080 --> 15:15.998
Oh, yeah.

15:14.080 --> 15:15.998
Is he waking up?

15:17.542 --> 15:18.292
Is he waking up?

15:19.919 --> 15:21.921
No, he's still sleeping.

15:22.505 --> 15:23.381
Dang it.

15:23.423 --> 15:24.507
What?

15:24.965 --> 15:26.509
Stand by. We're going

15:24.965 --> 15:26.509
to bring you back to reality.

15:26.885 --> 15:28.052
Okay.

15:30.471 --> 15:32.390
Charlotte,

15:30.471 --> 15:32.390
I can't get Jasper's--

15:35.769 --> 15:37.937
Today,

15:35.769 --> 15:37.937
that does not surprise me.

15:40.440 --> 15:41.190
Charlotte?

15:42.275 --> 15:42.983
Charlotte.

15:43.777 --> 15:45.445
What...

15:43.777 --> 15:45.445
What happened?

15:45.486 --> 15:46.237
(Ray)

15:45.486 --> 15:46.237
Bad news.

15:47.238 --> 15:48.364
Henry's still trapped

15:47.238 --> 15:48.364
in a dream state.

15:49.741 --> 15:51.576
Aw, man.

15:51.618 --> 15:52.786
And more bad news.

15:52.827 --> 15:53.703
What?

15:53.745 --> 15:55.246
We ate all your onion dip.

15:55.872 --> 15:57.248
Aw, no!

16:07.300 --> 16:08.551
Hey, hey!

16:08.593 --> 16:10.010
Here's something

16:08.593 --> 16:10.010
that might wake Henry up!

16:10.052 --> 16:11.262
What you got?

16:11.763 --> 16:13.055
Okay, this website says

16:13.848 --> 16:16.643
"Sometimes when a person

16:13.848 --> 16:16.643
is stuck in a deep dream state,

16:16.684 --> 16:18.102
you can stop the dreams

16:18.144 --> 16:20.020
by submerging

16:18.144 --> 16:20.020
the person underwater

16:20.062 --> 16:22.106
for between 30 and 45 minutes.

16:25.359 --> 16:27.194
Did it mention any side effects?

16:27.528 --> 16:28.237
Let me check.

16:28.613 --> 16:29.823
Scrolling down...

16:30.156 --> 16:30.990
(Charlotte)

16:30.156 --> 16:30.990
Okay.

16:31.950 --> 16:32.951
Here we go.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.911
"Side effects.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.911
Number one, death."

16:37.789 --> 16:39.248
Okay, let's not try that.

16:39.290 --> 16:40.040
Yeah.

16:41.835 --> 16:42.836
Guys...

16:44.086 --> 16:45.045
What are we going to do?

16:46.840 --> 16:48.007
What if we can

16:46.840 --> 16:48.007
never wake Henry up

16:48.048 --> 16:49.884
and he's stuck

16:48.048 --> 16:49.884
in a dream state forever?

16:51.427 --> 16:52.386
Ahoy!

16:53.847 --> 16:54.639
What?

16:55.139 --> 16:56.098
Why'd you say ahoy?

16:57.809 --> 17:00.854
Listen to what I just found

16:57.809 --> 17:00.854
on an ancient Hindu website.

17:00.895 --> 17:02.438
- What?

17:00.895 --> 17:02.438
- What's it say?

17:02.480 --> 17:05.107
"The most effective method

17:02.480 --> 17:05.107
of shocking a sleeping person

17:05.149 --> 17:07.986
out of a deep dream state is...

17:08.027 --> 17:09.069
Fright."

17:09.445 --> 17:10.112
Flight?

17:10.154 --> 17:12.114
Okay, so we just need

17:12.156 --> 17:13.491
to book Henry

17:12.156 --> 17:13.491
a flight somewhere.

17:13.533 --> 17:15.242
He's always wanted

17:13.533 --> 17:15.242
to go to Florida.

17:15.284 --> 17:16.995
- Perfect.

17:15.284 --> 17:16.995
Henry, you're going to Florida.

17:18.579 --> 17:21.207
I not say "flight."

17:21.248 --> 17:23.459
I say "fright."

17:21.248 --> 17:23.459
Fright.

17:23.501 --> 17:26.004
Like ooga, booga,

17:23.501 --> 17:26.004
ooga, booga, booga.

17:26.671 --> 17:28.965
Oh, fright.

17:29.757 --> 17:31.342
- Fright, fright.

17:29.757 --> 17:31.342
- Yes.

17:31.968 --> 17:34.428
Yes, we must put Charlotte

17:31.968 --> 17:34.428
back into Henry's dream.

17:34.470 --> 17:35.763
And she needs to scare him?

17:35.805 --> 17:38.265
She needs to terrify him.

17:38.307 --> 17:40.142
You got to scare

17:38.307 --> 17:40.142
the poof out of him.

17:40.685 --> 17:41.394
Poof?

17:42.729 --> 17:46.691
- Okay, when you say "poof",

17:42.729 --> 17:46.691
you talking about like--

17:42.729 --> 17:46.691
- You know what I mean.

17:46.733 --> 17:49.276
Wait. I'm not very good

17:46.733 --> 17:49.276
at scaring people.

17:50.611 --> 17:51.571
Then I help you.

17:55.533 --> 17:56.784
You see this?

17:56.826 --> 17:58.494
Yeah.

17:58.536 --> 18:00.120
It looks like something

17:58.536 --> 18:00.120
my uncle Rosco coughed up.

18:01.539 --> 18:03.290
You hear what she say

18:01.539 --> 18:03.290
about my bloob?

18:03.958 --> 18:05.001
It does look like a loogie.

18:06.377 --> 18:08.796
Just... How does that thing

18:06.377 --> 18:08.796
help me scare Henry?

18:08.838 --> 18:10.297
All right, here's the plan.

18:10.339 --> 18:11.925
We're going to send you back

18:10.339 --> 18:11.925
into Henry's dream.

18:11.966 --> 18:13.551
Okay.

18:13.593 --> 18:15.803
And when you get there,

18:13.593 --> 18:15.803
you find a refrigerator

18:15.845 --> 18:18.723
and you put this bloob inside.

18:18.765 --> 18:19.766
Then after 10 seconds,

18:19.807 --> 18:21.601
you get Henry

18:19.807 --> 18:21.601
to open the fridge.

18:22.393 --> 18:24.020
I don't think Henry's

18:22.393 --> 18:24.020
going to be that scared

18:24.062 --> 18:25.229
when he sees this blob.

18:25.271 --> 18:26.439
Bloob.

18:27.690 --> 18:29.025
Just trust us.

18:29.358 --> 18:30.234
Wait.

18:30.276 --> 18:31.360
What's going to happen

18:31.402 --> 18:32.653
when Henry opens

18:31.402 --> 18:32.653
the door to the fridge?

18:33.112 --> 18:34.154
Just look away.

18:34.530 --> 18:35.448
Look away.

18:40.995 --> 18:43.205
(screams)

18:51.213 --> 18:52.590
Wait. Where's the blob?

18:53.925 --> 18:54.675
Ew.

19:01.099 --> 19:05.061
Put the bloob in the fridge

19:01.099 --> 19:05.061
and wait 10 seconds.

19:07.814 --> 19:09.023
Henry!

19:09.816 --> 19:11.776
Hey, Henry, where are you?

19:12.944 --> 19:14.570
Henry!

19:14.904 --> 19:15.780
Charlotte?

19:16.572 --> 19:17.406
Charlotte!

19:18.365 --> 19:19.075
(Charlotte)

19:18.365 --> 19:19.075
Hey!

19:19.117 --> 19:19.951
(sighs)

19:19.993 --> 19:21.285
What's happening?

19:21.327 --> 19:24.413
Everything's been so crazy,

19:21.327 --> 19:24.413
and I don't get why.

19:25.790 --> 19:26.707
Can I have some juice?

19:28.709 --> 19:29.961
Juice?

19:30.003 --> 19:32.254
Yeah, I need some cold juice.

19:32.588 --> 19:34.715
You know, refrigerated.

19:36.383 --> 19:37.969
Okay, that's a pretty

19:36.383 --> 19:37.969
specific request.

19:38.011 --> 19:39.386
Just get me the juice.All right.

19:40.847 --> 19:42.890
I'm having a mental breakdown,

19:40.847 --> 19:42.890
all she cares about is juice.

19:44.142 --> 19:45.977
All right, what do you want?

19:44.142 --> 19:45.977
Apple? Orange? Cranber--

19:46.019 --> 19:49.355
(screaming)

19:52.775 --> 19:53.567
Henry!

19:54.944 --> 19:55.778
Henry?

20:02.451 --> 20:03.744
Henry,

20:02.451 --> 20:03.744
Henry!

20:03.786 --> 20:04.996
Wake up! Wake up!

20:05.038 --> 20:06.039
(both)

20:05.038 --> 20:06.039
Look away from the light!

20:06.789 --> 20:08.541
Aah! Aah!

20:09.333 --> 20:11.502
Aah, monster in my fridge!

20:12.086 --> 20:13.004
(laughs)

20:13.546 --> 20:15.006
It worked!

20:15.923 --> 20:19.927
Yeah, I was having

20:15.923 --> 20:19.927
the weirdest dreams.

20:20.302 --> 20:21.303
And you weren't there,

20:22.221 --> 20:23.222
and you weren't there,

20:24.640 --> 20:27.018
and everyone,

20:24.640 --> 20:27.018
everything was insane.

20:28.102 --> 20:29.145
Except for Charlotte.

20:29.770 --> 20:30.604
(both)

20:29.770 --> 20:30.604
Charlotte!

20:32.523 --> 20:33.440
Hello?

20:34.274 --> 20:35.275
Ray?

20:35.776 --> 20:36.610
Charlotte!

20:36.944 --> 20:38.571
Hi. Did Henry wake up?

20:38.612 --> 20:41.240
Yeah, he's here and he's okay.

20:41.281 --> 20:43.117
Awesome.

20:41.281 --> 20:43.117
Now, bring me back.

20:43.951 --> 20:44.952
Right. One sec.

20:46.412 --> 20:47.454
Bring Charlotte back.

20:48.164 --> 20:48.915
I can't.

20:49.582 --> 20:50.583
What?

20:50.624 --> 20:51.584
What do you mean you can't?

20:52.292 --> 20:54.587
I blew out my transnypular tube.

20:56.130 --> 20:57.381
Well, can't you get another one?

20:58.257 --> 21:00.093
Yeah,

20:58.257 --> 21:00.093
but it's like a two-hour drive.

21:01.343 --> 21:02.469
(Charlotte)

21:01.343 --> 21:02.469
Hey, what's happening?

21:04.680 --> 21:06.640
(Ray)

21:04.680 --> 21:06.640
Uh, listen.

21:06.891 --> 21:08.726
We're not going to be able

21:06.891 --> 21:08.726
to bring you back to reality

21:08.768 --> 21:10.477
for about four hours.

21:10.937 --> 21:12.230
Four hours?

21:12.271 --> 21:13.940
Well, what am I supposed to do,

21:13.981 --> 21:17.110
stuck here in Henry's

21:13.981 --> 21:17.110
bizarro dream for four hours?

21:19.528 --> 21:20.863
Do you know how to play mahjong?

21:24.200 --> 21:24.992
Six bam.

21:25.284 --> 21:26.244
Two crack.

21:27.078 --> 21:28.079
Three dot.

21:28.871 --> 21:29.622
Soap.

21:30.497 --> 21:31.249
Five dot.

21:31.832 --> 21:33.084
Go fish!

21:33.126 --> 21:34.543
(groaning)

21:36.087 --> 21:39.465
Jasper's head, I told you

21:36.087 --> 21:39.465
we're playing mahjong.

21:40.466 --> 21:42.260
Sorry, I forgot.

21:46.806 --> 21:49.100
Hey, Kanye,

21:46.806 --> 21:49.100
will you scratch my nose?

21:49.142 --> 21:50.726
No, man, I'm a genius.

21:52.228 --> 21:53.146
He is.

22:00.069 --> 22:04.991
(music)

22:22.925 --> 22:23.884
(oven bell)

22:23.926 --> 22:24.927
(Man)

22:23.926 --> 22:24.927
Mmm...
