to celebrate the union

of Jason and Mary.

00:25.480 --> 00:27.040
On this blessed day,

00:27.110 --> 00:30.080
they will both be asked
to give their deepest selves

00:30.110 --> 00:32.610
into the tender care
of the other.

00:32.650 --> 00:34.780
Marriage requires trust;

not only in our partner,
but in ourselves.

01:03.610 --> 01:04.750
Stuck around for the
ceremony again, huh?

01:04.780 --> 01:07.850
It was really beautiful.

01:07.880 --> 01:09.720
Well, you're just in time.

01:09.790 --> 01:11.490
I've got three more orders for
Wonder of Winter bouquets

01:11.520 --> 01:12.750
and two Thinking of Yous.

01:12.790 --> 01:14.260
Any eligible,

01:14.290 --> 01:15.790
handsome, young groomsmen?

01:15.830 --> 01:20.130
No. But that nice Mr. Gregson
catered the wedding.

01:20.200 --> 01:22.500

It's perfect,

02:11.480 --> 02:12.780

02:12.820 --> 02:14.250
Did you come all
the way across town

02:14.280 --> 02:15.780
just to tease me, Henry?

02:15.850 --> 02:17.650
Well, I wouldn't
put it past me, but, no.

02:17.690 --> 02:19.950
I came by to give you that.

02:19.990 --> 02:23.190
International Flower
Selection competition?

02:23.230 --> 02:25.130
- It's an entry form.
- I know.

02:25.160 --> 02:26.900
Are you planning on competing?

02:26.930 --> 02:29.060
No, you are.

02:29.100 --> 02:30.700
Henry, I don't have
a flower to enter.

02:30.770 --> 02:32.130
What? Of course you do...

02:32.170 --> 02:34.270
your Mystery Rose.

02:34.300 --> 02:36.200
Come on, Helen. You've been
breeding roses for years

02:36.240 --> 02:38.410
and this is... this is the
best thing you've ever done.

02:38.440 --> 02:41.640
You're just saying that because
you're my best friend.

02:41.680 --> 02:43.110
No, I'm not. I'm saying it
because it's true.

02:43.150 --> 02:45.250
Maybe next year.

02:45.280 --> 02:46.950
Hmm. I kinda figured
you might say that,

02:47.020 --> 02:48.780
so, um, I already submitted it.

02:48.820 --> 02:50.620
- What?
- Yeah. It's on its way.

02:50.650 --> 02:52.920
But you gotta fill this out
because they can't judge

02:52.960 --> 02:54.390
a submission without a name.

02:54.420 --> 02:56.520
Take a shot.
Give that little guy a name.

02:56.590 --> 02:58.060
- Henry...
- Henry's a great name.

02:58.090 --> 02:59.930
- [growling playfully]
- That's good!

03:00.000 --> 03:02.100
Think about it.

03:02.130 --> 03:04.730
Okay?
Hey, are we still on for lunch?

03:04.770 --> 03:07.870
Hey, Helen, we just got an order
for three more corsages.

03:07.940 --> 03:09.970
Thanks, Beth.

03:10.010 --> 03:12.410
You finally hired
some extra help.

03:12.440 --> 03:14.310
Yes. I might have to take
a rain check on that lunch.

03:14.340 --> 03:15.910
Uh, four more.

03:15.950 --> 03:17.710
A very long rain check.

03:17.750 --> 03:19.580
Okay. See ya later.

03:33.760 --> 03:36.900
A couple weeks in the shop and
you will be an expert.

03:36.930 --> 03:39.370
So, why is this called
the Mystery Rose?

03:39.440 --> 03:41.640
Because Helen has
yet to name it.

03:41.710 --> 03:43.710
This is one of yours?

03:43.740 --> 03:45.210
Mm-hmm.

03:45.280 --> 03:47.240
How do you make
a new rose exactly?

03:47.280 --> 03:50.810
Oh, you cross-pollinate by hand.

03:50.850 --> 03:53.580
It's a lot of trial and error.

03:53.620 --> 03:56.820
You want to find flowers that
complement each other.

03:58.620 --> 04:00.920
The right combination can
produce something...

04:00.960 --> 04:03.630
something new and wonderful.

04:03.660 --> 04:05.230
Beth:
It has such a sweet scent.

04:05.260 --> 04:07.130
[sniffing]
Almost like strawberries.

04:07.200 --> 04:08.400
Mm-hmm.

04:08.430 --> 04:09.730
- [sneezing]
- Oh!

04:09.770 --> 04:11.770
Oh, sorry.
It's also got a lot of pollen.

04:11.800 --> 04:14.670
I wanted to
make it bee friendly.

04:14.700 --> 04:16.200
Helen, you've made
dozens of roses.

04:16.269 --> 04:17.610
It never takes you more than

04:17.640 --> 04:19.209
a day or two to name them.

04:19.240 --> 04:21.380
I just haven't
thought of one yet.

04:21.410 --> 04:23.980
Well, if it doesn't have a name,

04:24.010 --> 04:27.520
it can't be considered for the
International Flower Selection.

04:27.550 --> 04:30.120
I see you've been
talking to Henry.

04:30.150 --> 04:32.520
International Flower
Selection, what's that?

04:32.560 --> 04:34.320
It's the Super Bowl
of flower breeding.

04:34.360 --> 04:39.160
Only the very, very best hybrids
in the world are considered.

04:39.200 --> 04:41.830
I mean, people
work their whole lives

04:41.870 --> 04:43.900
to create a rose
worthy of selection.

04:43.930 --> 04:46.470
You can't just enter on a whim.

04:46.500 --> 04:48.600
Well, I think you should do it.

04:48.640 --> 04:50.670
What's life without
a little risk, Helen?

04:50.710 --> 04:51.910
Yeah.

04:51.980 --> 04:54.410

05:05.690 --> 05:07.260
What are you
doing here so early?

05:07.290 --> 05:08.420
I wanted to catch you
before I went to work.

05:08.460 --> 05:09.690
Aww.

05:09.730 --> 05:11.530
I have two questions for you.

05:11.560 --> 05:14.000
No, I don't have a name yet.

05:14.060 --> 05:16.660
No. That was actually
the second one.

05:16.700 --> 05:20.130
- What's the first?
- What are you doing tonight?

05:20.200 --> 05:22.070
- Flowers.
- Maybe not.

05:22.110 --> 05:24.370
Check this out.

05:24.440 --> 05:25.610
Look at that.
I'll hold this.

05:25.640 --> 05:26.910
- What is this?
- It's an invitation

05:26.940 --> 05:28.880
from the Brooklyn
Metropolitan Art Gallery's

05:28.910 --> 05:31.510
annual Black & White Gala.

05:31.580 --> 05:33.150
They're hosting this year
at the botanical gardens,

05:33.220 --> 05:34.580
and the garden's director,
Mr. Carlisle,

05:34.650 --> 05:37.190
wants me to be there,
answer any questions

05:37.250 --> 05:39.190
people might have about
flowers or plants or whatever.

05:39.220 --> 05:41.160
Tonight?

05:41.190 --> 05:44.330
Wait. Here, look, look.
I'm prepared.

05:44.390 --> 05:46.230
I already bought the masks.

05:46.260 --> 05:48.200
- [laughing]
- Come on!

05:48.230 --> 05:49.260
I look a little better
in a mask, don't I?

05:49.300 --> 05:50.770
You look like Zorro.

05:50.800 --> 05:53.030
I'll take that.

05:53.070 --> 05:55.840
I-I can't just show up to a
masquerade ball, Henry.

05:55.870 --> 05:57.410
With one day's notice?

05:57.440 --> 06:00.940
I-I would need weeks to plan
for something like this.

06:00.980 --> 06:02.240
Weeks?

06:02.280 --> 06:05.050
Yes. The dress
and the shoes and the...

06:05.080 --> 06:06.710
[sighing]
You're a guy.

06:06.780 --> 06:08.650
You could just throw
on a tux and look dashing.

06:08.690 --> 06:11.890
Well, that's true.

06:13.290 --> 06:15.620
Thank you, but, um,

06:15.660 --> 06:18.590
I think I would just feel
completely unprepared.

06:18.630 --> 06:20.360
Well, you keep that

06:20.430 --> 06:22.200
and take this as well.

06:22.230 --> 06:24.570
The mask is in there for you,

06:24.630 --> 06:26.030
just in case you
change your mind.

06:26.100 --> 06:27.340
What if you want
to ask someone else?

06:27.400 --> 06:29.840
I won't.

06:34.110 --> 06:37.650
[bell ringing]

06:37.680 --> 06:40.110
You have an invitation
to the Black & White Gala?

06:40.150 --> 06:42.180
Those are impossible to get.

06:42.220 --> 06:44.020
Why didn't you tell me
you had plans for tonight?

06:44.050 --> 06:46.150
Because I don't.

06:46.220 --> 06:47.760
Henry just
stopped by to invite me,

06:47.790 --> 06:49.260
but I told him I couldn't go.

06:49.330 --> 06:50.460
Why not?

06:50.490 --> 06:51.990
You have to go.

06:52.030 --> 06:53.860
This is a once in
a lifetime opportunity.

06:53.900 --> 06:55.360
Well, I haven't even finished

06:55.400 --> 06:57.130
the centerpieces
for the Tyler wedding.

06:57.170 --> 07:00.840
We can all pitch in. Together,
we'll have it done in no time.

07:00.870 --> 07:03.170
I-I don't have a dress.

07:03.210 --> 07:05.740
My sister works at
a boutique on 54th;

07:05.780 --> 07:07.210
the gowns are amazing.

07:07.240 --> 07:08.980
I can head over
on my lunch break.

07:09.010 --> 07:10.850
Then that's settled.

07:10.910 --> 07:13.510
Let's get you to that ball.

07:16.120 --> 07:17.620
Okay.

07:20.320 --> 07:22.120
So, tell me about your date.

07:22.160 --> 07:23.320
Oh, it's not a date.

07:23.390 --> 07:27.160
Henry is Helen's...
good friend.

07:27.200 --> 07:28.660
I'd say he's a great friend

07:28.700 --> 07:30.360
if he's got you tickets
to the Black & White Gala.

07:30.400 --> 07:31.600
[chuckling]

07:31.670 --> 07:32.800
Well, he is pretty great.

07:32.840 --> 07:34.770
Have you known him long?

07:34.800 --> 07:36.700
Oh, we met back in college.

07:36.740 --> 07:38.840
We were in the botany
program together.

07:38.880 --> 07:41.110
He moved back to Montana
after graduation,

07:41.140 --> 07:43.340
but we ran into each
other a few years ago

07:43.380 --> 07:45.150
when he got a job
at the botanical gardens.

07:45.180 --> 07:47.580
That's one way to put it.

07:47.620 --> 07:49.580
Tell her about your reunion.

07:51.550 --> 07:54.090
I doubt she wants
to hear about that.

07:54.120 --> 07:55.290
Uh, I do.

07:55.360 --> 07:57.890
Uh, she does.

07:57.960 --> 07:59.530
Okay, well, all right,

07:59.600 --> 08:01.960
it was close to Valentine's Day,
and this is important

08:02.030 --> 08:03.500
because you see how busy
the shop can get?

08:03.530 --> 08:04.830
Yeah.

08:04.870 --> 08:06.330
So, we got an order
for an arrangement,

08:06.400 --> 08:07.970
a baby announcement...

08:08.040 --> 08:10.570
one of those big wreaths with
the bright blue flowers.

08:10.640 --> 08:12.140
With the ribbon that says,
"It's a boy."

08:12.180 --> 08:13.270
That's the one.

08:13.310 --> 08:14.510
That same day,

08:14.540 --> 08:16.210
Henry's sister also
called in an order...

08:16.250 --> 08:19.580
a congratulations bouquet for
his first day on the job.

08:19.620 --> 08:24.120
Well, somehow
the orders got switched.

08:24.150 --> 08:25.890
No! You showed up
with the wrong one?

08:25.920 --> 08:27.920
You can imagine his face when
he saw that big blue wreath.

08:27.990 --> 08:29.320
[all laughing]

08:29.360 --> 08:32.190
He still teases me
about it to this day.

08:32.230 --> 08:35.630
Oh, I love that story.

08:35.669 --> 08:38.200
So, you two never dated?

08:38.230 --> 08:40.230
No. No.

08:40.270 --> 08:43.940
I think true love
surprises you, like a bolt.

08:43.970 --> 08:47.410
Well, you of
all people should know

08:47.480 --> 08:50.280
that a flower
takes time to bloom.

08:50.310 --> 08:52.580
Mom used to always say that,

08:52.650 --> 08:55.580
from the moment she saw dad,
she knew he was the one.

08:55.620 --> 08:58.350
Not every love story starts
in the same way, hon.

08:58.390 --> 09:00.690
I know, but...

09:00.720 --> 09:03.160
I want mine to.

09:04.230 --> 09:07.330
Carol:
How does it fit?

09:07.360 --> 09:09.560
[gasping]

09:09.600 --> 09:12.330
Oh, Helen, you look wonderful.

09:12.370 --> 09:14.140
It's not too much?

09:14.170 --> 09:15.740
You'll be the belle of the ball.

09:15.770 --> 09:18.870
It's missing something, though.

09:18.940 --> 09:21.080
Maybe some longer earrings?

09:21.110 --> 09:23.540
I know! I've got
just the right thing.

09:23.580 --> 09:25.380
I stopped at home
to pick this up.

09:25.450 --> 09:28.250
I had a feeling
we might need it.

09:30.650 --> 09:32.520
It belonged to your mother.

09:32.590 --> 09:36.490
I remember.

He and his girlfriend had their
first date at an orchard

till I finally found them,

them overnight.

right here at that tree.

31:20.630 --> 31:24.400

petals all over the ground.

31:24.430 --> 31:27.770

he surprised his girlfriend

31:27.800 --> 31:30.900
and proposed right
there on that spot.

31:30.940 --> 31:32.540
Hmm. Did she say yes?

31:32.570 --> 31:34.470

43:35.360 --> 43:37.230
It was high.

43:37.300 --> 43:38.660
Yeah, but by the end of the day,

43:38.700 --> 43:42.670
before we left,
you did it, you jumped.

43:42.700 --> 43:45.170
The only reason I jumped

43:45.240 --> 43:48.470
is because
you were holding my hand.

43:48.510 --> 43:50.940
You remember what
you said afterwards?

43:52.980 --> 43:55.010
That it felt like flying.

43:55.050 --> 43:56.480
And?

43:56.520 --> 43:59.850
And that I wished
I'd done it sooner.

43:59.890 --> 44:00.920
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

44:00.990 --> 44:03.290
Oh, don't worry.

44:03.320 --> 44:04.490
- Henry, hey.
- Hey.

44:04.560 --> 44:05.920
Henry saw me through the window

44:05.960 --> 44:07.560
and came in to say hello.

44:07.600 --> 44:08.930
Oh, that was nice of him.

44:08.960 --> 44:10.600
- Well, I saved your seat.
- Thank you.

44:10.630 --> 44:11.930
Appreciate it.

44:11.970 --> 44:13.830
You got it.
Well, you two, enjoy.

44:13.870 --> 44:15.430
Thanks, Henry.

44:15.470 --> 44:17.870
Okay, any time.

44:22.180 --> 44:23.440
Charles: Alrighty.

44:34.890 --> 44:36.320
[knocking]

44:36.360 --> 44:37.660
- Hey.
- Hey.

44:37.690 --> 44:38.990
Coffee.

44:39.060 --> 44:41.490
- Oh, thank you.
- Yeah.

44:41.530 --> 44:43.060
- You're just in time.
- Oh, yeah?

44:43.130 --> 44:46.100
Flower named, application sent.

44:46.130 --> 44:49.030
What? Cheers.

44:49.070 --> 44:50.740
So, what are you gonna
do when you win?

44:50.770 --> 44:53.740
Hmm. Getting a little ahead
of ourselves, aren't we?

44:53.770 --> 44:56.480
You're right, you're right.
But can I be your plus one

44:56.510 --> 44:58.540
at the awards ceremony, please?
Henry!

44:58.580 --> 45:02.750
What? I just... seriously,
I'm proud of you for...

45:02.780 --> 45:04.450
for putting yourself
out there like that.

45:04.490 --> 45:07.020
I'm pretty proud of me, too.

45:07.050 --> 45:08.650
So, what name did you choose?

45:08.690 --> 45:12.690
Okay, so this is all about me
taking a leap, right?

45:12.730 --> 45:15.330
Right, yeah.

45:15.360 --> 45:18.900
So, I named it
the Crystal Valentine Rose.

45:20.230 --> 45:21.930
I like it.

45:21.970 --> 45:23.740
Me too.

45:25.240 --> 45:29.580
What are you doing tonight?

45:29.610 --> 45:33.280
I was, um, just planning
on finishing some work. Why?

45:33.310 --> 45:35.850
Do you want to come to
my place for dinner?

45:35.880 --> 45:37.750
Sure.

45:37.820 --> 45:41.250
Great.
Charles is coming over.

45:41.290 --> 45:43.590
I wanted him to meet Aunt Carol.

45:43.660 --> 45:46.530
I think it'd be fun
for us all to get together.

45:46.560 --> 45:47.730
Yeah.

45:47.760 --> 45:52.200
So, uh, things are going well.

45:52.270 --> 45:54.930
This past week has been amazing.

45:55.000 --> 45:58.270
You know, I might actually have
a real Valentine's this year.

45:58.310 --> 46:00.740
Wow. That's, uh...

46:02.410 --> 46:04.280
I'm really happy for you, Helen.

46:04.310 --> 46:06.550
So, you'll come?

46:06.580 --> 46:08.010
I wouldn't miss it.

46:08.050 --> 46:10.580
[chuckling]

46:15.960 --> 46:17.560
Here.

46:17.590 --> 46:19.420
"Poems by Emily Dickenson."

46:19.460 --> 46:20.830
Yeah, yeah.

46:20.860 --> 46:22.330
I mean, she loves
to quote her poems

46:22.360 --> 46:24.130
on the board outside
the flower shop, so...

46:24.170 --> 46:26.030
Wow. Are...

46:26.070 --> 46:27.530
are you sure she wouldn't just
like a bracelet or something?

46:27.570 --> 46:29.430
No.
[chuckling]

46:29.470 --> 46:31.770
No. No, she's gonna
love this, trust me.

46:31.810 --> 46:33.740
It's a...
it's a first edition, too.

46:33.810 --> 46:36.180
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah.

46:36.240 --> 46:38.710
That's great. I didn't expect
you to actually buy something.

46:38.750 --> 46:41.610
I thought you would have just
told me what to get.

46:41.650 --> 46:43.420
But this... this is amazing.

46:43.450 --> 46:44.850
Nah, I mean, I noticed it
in the window of the bookstore

46:44.890 --> 46:46.150
a couple times walking by.

46:46.190 --> 46:48.120
It was no big deal.

46:48.160 --> 46:50.220
Are you sure you wouldn't just
rather give it to her yourself?

46:51.890 --> 46:53.590
No. No, no.

46:53.630 --> 46:55.430
This is gonna mean a lot more
coming from you, trust me.

46:55.460 --> 46:57.430
Wow. That's great.

46:57.500 --> 47:00.170
Well, thank you.
That's very generous of you.

47:00.200 --> 47:04.000
You got it.
I'll see ya.

47:04.040 --> 47:07.170
[doorbell ringing]

47:07.240 --> 47:09.880
Come on in.

47:09.910 --> 47:11.980
- Hello!
- Hey.

47:12.010 --> 47:13.510
I brought my best casserole.

47:13.580 --> 47:15.280
Thank you. Beth, I'm so glad
you could make it.

47:15.350 --> 47:16.880
Like I was gonna
pass up a chance

47:16.920 --> 47:18.320
to finally meet Prince Charming.

47:18.350 --> 47:19.520
Can I help in the kitchen.

47:19.590 --> 47:23.220
- Yes, please.
- Okay.

47:23.290 --> 47:26.490
So, she walks straight up to me,

47:26.560 --> 47:28.090
She's got me pinned
in the corner.

47:28.160 --> 47:29.460
She's talking,
like, a mile a minute.

47:29.500 --> 47:31.960
She's under
the mistaken impression

47:32.000 --> 47:34.670
that I am Henry.

47:34.700 --> 47:37.970
Okay, in my defense,
he was wearing a mask.

47:38.010 --> 47:39.300
You never told me that.

47:39.370 --> 47:42.070
Well, it was embarrassing.

47:42.140 --> 47:43.740
I think it's just about

47:43.780 --> 47:45.440
the most romantic
thing I have ever heard.

47:45.480 --> 47:47.650
Like, something
out of a fairy-tale.

47:47.680 --> 47:51.450
Well, she made an impression,
that's for sure.

47:51.490 --> 47:54.820
Uh, so, Charles, what do you
like to do for fun?

47:54.860 --> 47:57.420
Well, I don't really have much
free time these days.

47:57.460 --> 47:59.090
Work keeps me extremely busy

47:59.160 --> 48:00.560
and I have a very
demanding clientele.

48:00.630 --> 48:01.990
Carol:
Oh, I know what you mean.

48:02.030 --> 48:03.630
Other than Valentine's Day,

48:03.660 --> 48:05.400
the only other day
that puts fear in the heart

48:05.430 --> 48:07.670
of any florist is...

48:07.700 --> 48:09.740
Both:
Mother's Day.

48:09.770 --> 48:12.400
No. We have to do this
all again in a few months?

48:12.470 --> 48:14.770
I barely survived this time.

48:14.810 --> 48:17.840
Carol: Oh, you'll be a pro
by that time, Beth.

48:17.880 --> 48:19.650
Yeah, battle tested.

48:19.680 --> 48:22.610
I'm not sure it's
quite the same thing.

48:24.350 --> 48:26.920
Oh, I suppose not.

48:26.950 --> 48:30.260
Well, Carol and Helen
are at the flower market

48:30.320 --> 48:31.660
every morning by five

48:31.690 --> 48:33.160
and there's long days
at the shop, right?

48:33.190 --> 48:34.760
Not to mention the days
you're in the greenhouse,

48:34.800 --> 48:36.660
I mean, hours on end.

48:36.700 --> 48:39.160
Oh, I didn't mean to imply
that you're not busy.

48:39.200 --> 48:41.730
I know, I know.

48:41.770 --> 48:44.070
Well, when I do manage
to sneak away,

48:44.140 --> 48:46.740
I enjoy myself some poker.

48:46.770 --> 48:48.870
Oh, my late husband loved poker.

48:48.910 --> 48:50.810
He used to have a weekly game.
Do you remember, Helen?

48:50.840 --> 48:52.510
I do.

48:52.580 --> 48:55.710
Just another thing
I was excited to discover

48:55.750 --> 48:58.920
that we had in common.

48:58.950 --> 49:01.020
Helen, you didn't tell me
you started to play poker.

49:01.060 --> 49:04.290
Oh, I didn't mention it?

49:04.330 --> 49:05.890
You know, her uncle

49:05.930 --> 49:07.430
tried to get her to play
for the longest time,

49:07.490 --> 49:09.390
but she was never interested.

49:09.430 --> 49:11.630
Well, I've come around.

49:11.670 --> 49:14.070
You know,
it's an acquired taste.

49:14.100 --> 49:15.500
'Cause, I mean, I tried
to teach you last year,

49:15.540 --> 49:17.470
but you pretty much just
got up and walked away.

49:20.010 --> 49:21.810
I'm more of a
gin rummy girl myself.

49:21.840 --> 49:25.340
Oh.

49:28.620 --> 49:29.750
More wine, anyone?

49:29.780 --> 49:30.073
- Yes.

49:30.098 --> 49:30.974
- Yes, please.
- Thank you.

49:31.020 --> 49:32.180
Yeah, I'll have some, too.

49:32.220 --> 49:34.650
- Thank you.
- Charles: Thank you.

49:38.830 --> 49:40.960
I think it's going well, right?

49:41.000 --> 49:42.630
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

49:42.660 --> 49:44.400
Yeah, he's, um,
certainly won over Beth.

49:44.430 --> 49:46.330
[Beth laughing]

49:46.370 --> 49:47.570
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

49:47.600 --> 49:50.400
You hate carrot cake.

49:52.010 --> 49:54.440
[sighing]
I don't have carrot cake.

49:54.480 --> 49:55.910
Yes, you do.

49:55.940 --> 49:59.110
You know, maybe I just
haven't taken the time

49:59.150 --> 50:01.150
to appreciate it.

50:01.220 --> 50:03.080
I'm trying to expand
my horizons.

50:03.120 --> 50:04.250
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

50:04.280 --> 50:05.980
Well, then, here.

50:06.020 --> 50:07.950
Have a bite.

50:08.020 --> 50:10.460
Uh, I'm the hostess;

50:10.490 --> 50:12.490
it would be rude for me
to eat before the guests.

50:12.530 --> 50:14.790
Ah.

50:14.860 --> 50:17.000
Um, I want to talk
to you about something.

50:19.300 --> 50:20.730
Oh, no.

50:20.770 --> 50:22.700
- What?
- I know that tone.

50:22.740 --> 50:24.000
There's no tone.

50:24.040 --> 50:26.200
Yes, there is.

50:26.240 --> 50:28.640
This is bad news.

50:28.680 --> 50:30.480
No, it's not.
It's not bad. It's, um...

50:30.510 --> 50:31.680
it's different.

50:31.710 --> 50:32.780
Different is always bad.

50:32.810 --> 50:33.880
That's not true.

50:33.910 --> 50:35.510
Different can be exciting.

50:35.550 --> 50:38.580
Okay, I'm ready.

50:38.620 --> 50:40.550
Just do it.

50:40.590 --> 50:42.450
Quickly, like
ripping off a Band-Aid.

50:42.490 --> 50:44.090
I'm just not exactly
sure how to say this.

50:44.120 --> 50:45.290
Um, the thing is, Helen...

50:45.360 --> 50:46.760
Helen.

50:46.830 --> 50:48.960
Charles is just the best.

50:49.000 --> 50:50.800
- I'm so happy for you.
- Thank you.

50:50.830 --> 50:52.260
He's so charming

50:52.330 --> 50:54.330
and really handsome.
Isn't he handsome, Henry?

50:54.370 --> 50:56.970
Yes, he's very handsome.

50:57.040 --> 50:58.670
I can see why you
mistook him for me.

50:58.710 --> 51:00.140
[laughing]
You're funny.

51:00.170 --> 51:01.670
He's funny.
Let me help you guys with this.

51:01.740 --> 51:02.870
Okay.
Thank you.

51:02.910 --> 51:04.080
Is this carrot cake?

51:04.110 --> 51:06.240
Mm-hmm.
Oh, it's my favorite.

51:06.310 --> 51:08.710
Yeah? Helen's too.

51:12.320 --> 51:13.850
Helen: Thank you.

51:13.920 --> 51:15.390
That was fun.

51:15.420 --> 51:17.160
Really?

51:17.190 --> 51:18.820
You're not just saying that?

51:18.860 --> 51:20.730
No, your friends
and family are great.

51:21.800 --> 51:24.230
Hey, I almost forgot.

51:24.260 --> 51:25.430
I got you something.

51:25.470 --> 51:27.100
Oh, you didn't have to.

51:27.130 --> 51:29.000
No, I know.
I wanted to.

51:29.040 --> 51:31.640
Come on, open it.

51:31.670 --> 51:33.140
I would've brought you flowers,

51:33.170 --> 51:35.040
but I was afraid I would
get the wrong colours

51:35.080 --> 51:36.740
and say all the wrong things.

51:40.250 --> 51:43.080
"Poems by Emily Dickenson."

51:43.150 --> 51:45.120
[chuckling]

51:45.150 --> 51:46.650
Yeah, I was in a
bookstore the other day

51:46.720 --> 51:48.890
and I saw it
and I thought of you.

51:48.920 --> 51:50.060
Really?

51:50.120 --> 51:51.490
Yeah.
It's a first edition.

51:51.530 --> 51:55.830
I... this is perfect.
I love it. Thank you.

51:59.900 --> 52:01.830
Good night, Helen.

52:01.870 --> 52:04.300
Good night.

52:15.580 --> 52:17.250
I mean, Emily Dickenson.

52:17.320 --> 52:19.450
I know! That is
the perfect gift for you.

52:19.490 --> 52:20.890
Aunt Carol loved him.

52:20.920 --> 52:22.390
Well, I mean,
he did compliment her casserole

52:22.420 --> 52:23.990
like three separate times.

52:24.020 --> 52:25.290
What about you?

52:25.330 --> 52:26.760
I told her it was fantastic,

52:26.790 --> 52:28.130
but I didn't belabour the point.

52:28.200 --> 52:30.360
No. What do you think about him?

52:30.400 --> 52:32.630
It doesn't matter what I think.
It matters what you think.

52:32.670 --> 52:34.530
It's important to me
that you like him.

52:34.570 --> 52:35.970
Yeah?

52:36.000 --> 52:37.170
Yeah.

52:37.200 --> 52:38.400
Why?

52:38.440 --> 52:41.170
Because...

52:41.210 --> 52:43.280
you're my best friend.

52:45.250 --> 52:48.150
Well...

52:48.180 --> 52:50.420
I think he seems
like a good guy.

52:50.450 --> 52:51.620
Yeah?

52:51.650 --> 52:53.350
Yeah.

52:53.390 --> 52:54.650
And if anyone deserves
a happy ending,

52:54.690 --> 52:57.120
Helen, it's you.

52:58.460 --> 52:59.690
Thanks, Henry.

53:01.530 --> 53:04.300
Oh, what were you
gonna tell me earlier?

53:04.330 --> 53:06.900
Oh, we can talk about it later.

53:13.040 --> 53:15.410
Carol: Now, are these the ones
that you'd like?

53:15.440 --> 53:18.210
Well, I have lots in the back.
Let's go get some, okay?

53:18.250 --> 53:20.050
Right through here.

53:20.110 --> 53:22.550
[bell ringing]

53:41.340 --> 53:42.530
Hey, Henry.

53:42.570 --> 53:44.240
Hey. Nice job on the board.

53:44.300 --> 53:45.770
Thanks.

53:45.810 --> 53:48.110
Hey, it was really fun
talking with you last night.

53:48.140 --> 53:49.570
Yeah, you too.

53:49.610 --> 53:52.140
We should do it again
some time. All of us.

53:52.180 --> 53:53.710
Definitely.

53:53.750 --> 53:55.010
Don't be a stranger.

53:55.050 --> 53:57.480
Okay.

54:01.720 --> 54:06.560
[humming]

54:09.730 --> 54:12.900
Someone's in a good mood.

54:12.930 --> 54:14.730
Remember how, last night,

54:14.770 --> 54:16.600
we were all talking about
how busy the shop gets

54:16.640 --> 54:18.070
during the Valentine's rush?

54:18.110 --> 54:19.670
Well...

54:19.710 --> 54:23.240
this morning, this was waiting
for me on the counter.

54:23.280 --> 54:24.940
"Good luck.

54:24.980 --> 54:26.340
"Hope this helps."

54:26.380 --> 54:27.750
Isn't that so thoughtful
of Charles?

54:27.810 --> 54:30.020
Charles gave you that?

54:30.080 --> 54:33.080
Yeah.
Who else would it be?

54:33.150 --> 54:34.790
Oh, I just thought...

54:34.820 --> 54:37.790
Never mind.

54:37.860 --> 54:40.190
So, what's Henry's story?

54:40.230 --> 54:42.890
What do you mean?

54:42.930 --> 54:46.870
Is he seeing anyone or...

54:46.900 --> 54:49.170
No.

54:50.700 --> 54:53.940
Why? Are...
Are you interested in Henry?

54:53.970 --> 54:55.410
I don't know.

54:55.440 --> 54:57.710
I feel like we hit it off.

54:57.740 --> 55:00.150
When you and Charles were
outside, we got to talking.

55:00.180 --> 55:02.450
And did you know he has
his pilot's license?

55:02.480 --> 55:03.720
I did.

55:03.750 --> 55:05.320
He's really smart...

55:05.350 --> 55:08.620
and funny and cute.
Don't you think?

55:08.690 --> 55:11.220
Yeah. Yes.

55:11.290 --> 55:12.460
Sure.

55:12.490 --> 55:14.890
Oh, they're waiting for these.

55:20.600 --> 55:22.700
Hmm.

55:24.870 --> 55:27.210
Thank you.
Enjoy your bouquet. Bye-bye.

55:27.240 --> 55:28.340
[bell ringing]

55:29.840 --> 55:31.340
Hey, Carol.

55:31.410 --> 55:34.110
Hi, Henry.

55:34.180 --> 55:36.310
Is, uh, Helen in the back?

55:36.350 --> 55:38.420
Oh. No, I'm sorry. She's out
with Charles right now.

55:38.450 --> 55:42.120
Oh. I thought we had
plans for lunch,

55:42.160 --> 55:43.620
but I guess I got the day wrong.

55:43.660 --> 55:46.220
Aww. Well, I can
tell her you stopped by.

55:46.260 --> 55:49.260
That's okay. I'll... I'll just
try and catch up with her later.

55:49.300 --> 55:50.760
- Okay.
- Okay.

55:55.340 --> 55:58.570
[sighing]

56:09.450 --> 56:11.020
Henry?

56:11.050 --> 56:13.490
Oh. Hey, Beth.
How are you?

56:13.520 --> 56:14.990
- Good.
- Good.

56:15.020 --> 56:17.090
Things were so crazy
at the flower shop,

56:17.120 --> 56:19.990
I needed a pick-me-up to make it
through the rest of the day.

56:20.030 --> 56:22.230
I bet you did.

56:22.260 --> 56:23.860
Can I join you?

56:23.900 --> 56:25.960
Uh, yeah, sure. Please.

56:26.000 --> 56:27.270
Great.

56:29.640 --> 56:31.040
What you reading?

56:31.070 --> 56:33.000
Oh. Um, it's just something

56:33.040 --> 56:34.810
I picked up at the bookstore
across the street.

56:34.880 --> 56:36.740
I was supposed to
have lunch with Helen,

56:36.780 --> 56:38.380
but things changed, so...

56:38.450 --> 56:40.080
You two have been friends
for a long time, huh?

56:40.110 --> 56:42.810
Since college.

56:42.850 --> 56:44.550
And then, we reconnected when I
moved back to New York, yeah.

56:44.620 --> 56:46.250
She told me about that.
It's a great story.

56:46.290 --> 56:49.190
Right? Although,
I'm not sure it can top

56:49.220 --> 56:51.590
mistaken identities
at a masquerade ball.

56:51.630 --> 56:53.060
Mistaken bouquets.

56:53.090 --> 56:54.390
I like that.

56:54.430 --> 56:56.960
Yeah, I guess so.

56:57.000 --> 56:59.430
[sighing]
Man...

57:06.610 --> 57:10.040
You know, I'm actually
not that hungry.

57:10.110 --> 57:11.480
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, yeah.

57:11.550 --> 57:12.780
You wanna go for a walk?

57:12.850 --> 57:15.010
Yeah. Lead the way.

57:15.050 --> 57:16.650
I don't know if
I believe in fate,

57:16.680 --> 57:21.120
but that moment, I was close

57:21.150 --> 57:25.720
'cause I just moved
back to the city, um,

57:25.760 --> 57:29.960
for a fresh start. It was...
It was a bit of a tricky time.

57:30.000 --> 57:33.570
I had just finished a divorce
and things were very chaotic,

57:33.630 --> 57:36.800
and as soon as I signed on
with the botanical gardens,

57:36.870 --> 57:38.770
I immediately regretted it.

57:38.810 --> 57:42.370
And I remember
sitting in my office

57:42.410 --> 57:44.610
and wondering if
uprooting my entire life

57:44.680 --> 57:46.780
was just this colossal mistake.

57:46.810 --> 57:51.050
And then, in walks Helen

57:51.080 --> 57:54.890
with this... with this...
with this silly bouquet.

57:54.920 --> 57:58.360
And I just knew...

57:58.390 --> 58:00.260
I don't know,
right then and right there,

58:00.290 --> 58:04.530
that I'd made the right choice.

58:05.970 --> 58:07.930
Oh, my gosh.

58:08.940 --> 58:10.470
What?

58:10.500 --> 58:11.700
I can't believe I didn't notice.

58:11.770 --> 58:12.940
Notice what?

58:12.970 --> 58:14.740
You're in love with Helen.

58:14.770 --> 58:16.810
[chuckling]
I'm in love...

58:16.840 --> 58:19.740
That's... I'm not...

58:23.980 --> 58:26.250
[sighing]

58:26.290 --> 58:28.420
For how long?

58:33.260 --> 58:35.690
[sighing]

58:37.030 --> 58:38.560
A while.

58:38.600 --> 58:41.200
Not since the flower mix-up.

58:41.230 --> 58:43.230
Well...

58:43.270 --> 58:45.600
And you never said anything?

58:46.970 --> 58:51.440
The timing just
was never quite right. Um...

58:51.480 --> 58:55.050
When we reconnected,
she was in a relationship,

58:55.120 --> 58:57.450
and by the time they broke up,
I had a girlfriend.

58:57.480 --> 59:00.020
It just... we were never
just quite in sync.

59:00.050 --> 59:01.750
But your both single now.

59:01.790 --> 59:04.460
You finally had your window.
Why tell her about Charles?

59:05.830 --> 59:09.890
Because...
it made her happy.

59:12.000 --> 59:14.430
[sighing]

59:15.970 --> 59:18.070
You're a good guy, Henry.

59:18.140 --> 59:21.070
[scoffing]

59:21.110 --> 59:23.270
Here, have a cookie.

59:23.340 --> 59:25.780
You need it more than I do.

59:29.280 --> 59:31.620
Helen:
It was right here.

59:31.650 --> 59:33.420
Ah, I spent an hour
with this guy,

59:33.450 --> 59:35.850
pulling off orange
petals from the flowers.

59:35.890 --> 59:37.660
[phone ringing]
I gotta take this.

59:37.690 --> 59:39.220
Oh.
[phone ringing]

59:39.260 --> 59:40.560
Hey.

59:40.590 --> 59:42.060
No, no, just stall him.

59:42.130 --> 59:43.760
Look, I'll be there in 20,
all right? Hold tight.

59:43.800 --> 59:45.230
Ah, it's work; I gotta go.

59:45.270 --> 59:47.100
Ah, it's okay.
I understand.

59:47.170 --> 59:49.200
I am so close to
closing this sale,

59:49.270 --> 59:51.200
and once I do, I'll have
a lot more free time.

59:51.240 --> 59:53.710
But until then, there's just too
much on the line right now.

59:53.740 --> 59:55.470
Sounds big.
It is.

59:55.510 --> 59:57.910
I'm brokering a deal
to buy the botanical gardens.

59:59.510 --> 01:00:01.450
Buy them?

01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:03.150
Yeah, it's a great location.

01:00:03.220 --> 01:00:06.180
My client, he's gonna put up
these beautiful luxury condos.

01:00:06.220 --> 01:00:08.090
Wait, wait.

01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:10.290
You're gonna replace the
botanical gardens with condos?

01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:12.520
You didn't know.

01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:15.260
How could I know?

01:00:15.300 --> 01:00:17.500
Well, the botanical gardens,
they're in a lot of debt.

01:00:17.530 --> 01:00:20.300
It's become unmanageable
and they're looking to sell.

01:00:20.330 --> 01:00:22.070
Uh...

01:00:22.100 --> 01:00:24.900
I thought, for sure,
Henry would have told you.

01:00:24.970 --> 01:00:28.770
Uh...

01:00:28.810 --> 01:00:30.510
Hey.

01:00:30.540 --> 01:00:32.010
Hey.

01:00:32.050 --> 01:00:33.650
When were you gonna tell me?

01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:35.410
Tell you what?

01:00:35.450 --> 01:00:37.550
That they're selling
the botanical gardens.

01:00:37.620 --> 01:00:39.250
Oh, you found out.

01:00:39.290 --> 01:00:40.850
Yeah, I found out.

01:00:40.890 --> 01:00:42.420
Charles is negotiating the deal.

01:00:42.490 --> 01:00:44.160
They're closing this week

01:00:44.190 --> 01:00:46.760
and they're gonna turn it
into cheap real estate.

01:00:46.790 --> 01:00:48.760
Hey, Helen, the gardens have
been in financial trouble

01:00:48.830 --> 01:00:50.960
for months now.
I have tried everything.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.960
That's why I left you
the night of the gala,

01:00:53.030 --> 01:00:55.170
to go off and try and
impress a potential investor...

01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:58.000
Andrew Grey... with so much money

01:00:58.070 --> 01:01:00.710
and a diverse portfolio.
We were so sure

01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:02.510
that he was gonna be
the guy to save this place,

01:01:02.540 --> 01:01:05.440
to bail us out, but...

01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:07.210
But he didn't go for it.

01:01:07.250 --> 01:01:10.420
Henry...

01:01:10.450 --> 01:01:13.250
What are you gonna do?
What about your job?

01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:15.120
Well, um...

01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:16.520
since I saw it coming,

01:01:16.590 --> 01:01:19.220
I had time to
line up another job. I, uh...

01:01:19.260 --> 01:01:21.860
I accepted a research position

01:01:21.930 --> 01:01:24.260
at a national park.

01:01:24.300 --> 01:01:28.130
It's, um... it's a big deal.
I-I get to head up a whole team.

01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:32.870
Well, that's...
that's great, isn't it?

01:01:32.910 --> 01:01:36.470
It's, um...

01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:38.580
It's in Arizona.

01:01:39.850 --> 01:01:41.480
Arizona?

01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:43.880
They want me there on the 14th.

01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:46.120
That's next Wednesday.

01:01:46.150 --> 01:01:47.320
I know.

01:01:47.350 --> 01:01:48.920
When were you gonna tell me?
I tried.

01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:51.520
You tried? You couldn't
have tried that hard.

01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:52.920
You've been busy.

01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:55.190
Not too busy for this, Henry.

01:01:55.230 --> 01:01:58.360
There just was never
a good time to tell you.

I'm still mad at you.

01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:32.800
I know.

You can't make up for this with
a cup of coffee, Henry.

01:04:49.900 --> 01:04:51.870
[sighing]

01:04:51.940 --> 01:04:53.440
Well, I know you have the
wedding tomorrow,

01:04:53.470 --> 01:04:55.370
so I just, uh...

01:04:55.410 --> 01:04:59.180
I just came to say goodbye.

01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:05.620
I can't believe
you're actually leaving.

01:05:05.650 --> 01:05:09.720
I know. And this week went by so
much faster than I thought.

01:05:09.790 --> 01:05:11.660
You know, I wanted to come
by more. I'm sorry I didn't.

01:05:11.690 --> 01:05:14.330
Oh, no. I totally get it.

01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:16.160
You had your
whole life to pack up.

01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:19.130
Yeah.

01:05:23.740 --> 01:05:25.140
What time's your flight?

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:27.310
Four.

01:05:33.510 --> 01:05:36.580
I... I'm really gonna miss you.

01:05:39.750 --> 01:05:41.590
Me too.

01:05:43.660 --> 01:05:45.720
Happy Valentine's.

01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:54.100
Okay.

01:05:54.130 --> 01:05:55.830
Wait, your...

01:05:55.870 --> 01:05:58.300
a little askew.

01:05:59.470 --> 01:06:00.910
Bye.

01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:14.750

01:06:19.990 --> 01:06:32.440
<i>♪ </i>

01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:38.640
Saying goodbye to Henry was
harder than I thought.

01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:40.910
I mean, I knew
it was going to be hard.

01:06:40.950 --> 01:06:42.780
Well, he is your best friend,

01:06:42.820 --> 01:06:44.520
of course you're
going to be sad.

01:06:44.580 --> 01:06:48.620
Yeah, but...

01:06:48.650 --> 01:06:50.960
it felt like...

01:06:50.990 --> 01:06:52.590
more than that.

01:06:53.830 --> 01:06:56.430
What are you saying?

01:06:56.460 --> 01:06:58.800
I don't know.
I don't know what I'm saying.

01:06:58.870 --> 01:07:03.170
It's like... I guess
I'd just like a sign,

01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:05.240
you know, that...

01:07:05.270 --> 01:07:08.740
that I made the right choice.

01:07:08.780 --> 01:07:12.080
Hey, Helen,

01:07:12.110 --> 01:07:13.780
courier just dropped
this off for you.

01:07:13.810 --> 01:07:15.680
What?

01:07:15.750 --> 01:07:18.050
Gift?

01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:20.520
Helen, what did you get?

01:07:26.030 --> 01:07:28.430
[chuckling]

01:07:32.470 --> 01:07:36.570
A sign.
[sighing]

01:07:39.470 --> 01:07:43.640
Clerk:
That'll be $3.50.

01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:45.540
Charles: Henry!

01:07:45.610 --> 01:07:46.780
Hey.

01:07:46.810 --> 01:07:48.680
Heard your heading out west.

01:07:48.710 --> 01:07:49.680
Yeah.

01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:50.850
Today.

01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:53.620
Wow.
Yeah.

01:07:53.650 --> 01:07:56.020
So, big plans for
Valentine's Day tonight?

01:07:56.060 --> 01:07:58.020
Yeah, no. Helen's working a
wedding, I'm gonna help her out.

01:07:58.090 --> 01:07:59.760
Maybe grab a bite to eat after.

01:07:59.790 --> 01:08:02.060
Not really sure she'll
be up for anything.

01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:03.830
I think she will be.

01:08:03.860 --> 01:08:05.400
Yeah, she says
she gets pretty exhausted

01:08:05.430 --> 01:08:06.960
after these big events.

01:08:07.030 --> 01:08:09.970
Well, I mean, Valentine's Day
means a lot to her.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.440
I'd really try to
make it special,

01:08:12.470 --> 01:08:14.070
something to let her know that

01:08:14.110 --> 01:08:16.210
you feel really lucky that she's
in your life. You know?

01:08:18.109 --> 01:08:20.340
Hey...

01:08:20.380 --> 01:08:22.609
I should really
thank you, Helen.

01:08:22.649 --> 01:08:24.720
You know, if it wasn't
for you finding me,

01:08:24.750 --> 01:08:27.080
I would've just been
the man behind the mask.

01:08:28.689 --> 01:08:31.460
My pleasure.

01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:34.229
Okay. Have a safe flight.
Don't be a stranger.

01:08:34.290 --> 01:08:35.630
Okay.
All right.

01:08:35.660 --> 01:08:38.700
Take care.

01:08:38.729 --> 01:08:42.130
[sighing]

01:08:46.069 --> 01:08:50.270
Mr. Gregson: Is, uh, Carol
helping you today?

01:08:50.340 --> 01:08:51.810
Helen:
Not at the moment, Mr. Gregson.

01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:53.439
She's at the shop.

01:08:53.479 --> 01:08:56.580
You know, you should
stop by sometime.

01:08:56.620 --> 01:08:58.649
- She'd love to see you.
- Maybe I will.

01:09:00.819 --> 01:09:01.990
Charles: Careful.

01:09:02.020 --> 01:09:03.189
Helen: You okay?

01:09:03.220 --> 01:09:05.790
Yeah. Beth handed me these

01:09:05.830 --> 01:09:07.319
and told me to walk straight
until I found you.

01:09:07.390 --> 01:09:09.260
You can put that right here.

01:09:09.330 --> 01:09:10.660
Okay. How is that?

01:09:10.700 --> 01:09:12.830
Great.

01:09:12.899 --> 01:09:16.100
Just, uh...

01:09:16.170 --> 01:09:18.439
Okay, I guess I don't
have your touch.

01:09:19.410 --> 01:09:20.970
Thank you.

01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:22.510
I told you, I'm just happy

01:09:22.540 --> 01:09:24.840
to be able to spend
Valentine's with you.

01:09:24.910 --> 01:09:28.109
No, no, not for this.
Well, not just for this.

01:09:28.180 --> 01:09:29.680
For my gift.

01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:30.850
Gift?

01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:33.520
The painting.

01:09:33.550 --> 01:09:35.189
How did you track
down the winner?

01:09:35.220 --> 01:09:36.689
Helen, you're losing me here.
What painting?

01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:39.390
Helen,

01:09:39.430 --> 01:09:41.529
these look wonderful.

01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:43.130
I think I'm going to cry.

01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:44.630
You got your makeup on.

01:09:44.660 --> 01:09:45.630
It's fine.
It's waterproof mascara.

01:09:45.700 --> 01:09:49.930
In that case...

01:09:49.970 --> 01:09:53.200
Oh, it's perfect.
[chuckling]

01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:55.440
Do you love it?

01:09:55.470 --> 01:09:57.880
They're amazing. Now,
I can officially go get dressed.

01:09:57.910 --> 01:10:01.450
Mr. Andrew Grey?

01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:02.580
That's my grandfather.

01:10:02.620 --> 01:10:05.050
Did he, by any chance,

01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:07.380
- attend the masquerade gala?
- He did.

01:10:07.450 --> 01:10:09.320
I tried to get him
to give me his tickets

01:10:09.390 --> 01:10:10.790
as an early wedding gift,

01:10:10.860 --> 01:10:13.160
but apparently he had some
business to addend to.

01:10:13.190 --> 01:10:14.530
Is he here?

01:10:14.590 --> 01:10:16.190
Yeah, he's over
by the guest-book.

01:10:16.230 --> 01:10:19.330
Thank you.

01:10:22.030 --> 01:10:23.730
Excuse me, Mr. Grey?

01:10:23.770 --> 01:10:25.600
Yes.

01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:27.910
Hi. I'm Helen.
I'm the florist for the wedding.

01:10:27.940 --> 01:10:30.370
Mr. Grey: Oh, well, you did
a splendid job here.

01:10:30.410 --> 01:10:31.810
Oh, I was in your shop recently.

01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:34.280
- Great little place.
- Helen: Thank you.

01:10:34.310 --> 01:10:37.210
I was told that you recently
toured the botanical gardens,

01:10:37.250 --> 01:10:38.850
that you were
considering investing.

01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:41.390
I... was considering it.

01:10:41.420 --> 01:10:44.290
What's this about exactly?

01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:46.420
I wondered if
you might reconsider.

01:10:46.460 --> 01:10:48.190
Mr. Grey.

01:10:48.230 --> 01:10:49.860
Would you excuse us
just one second?

01:10:49.900 --> 01:10:51.700
- Uh, yes.
- Excuse me.

01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:53.460
Yep.

01:10:53.530 --> 01:10:55.170
What are you doing?

01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:57.030
I'm trying to save
the botanical gardens.

01:10:57.100 --> 01:10:58.840
I am so extremely close
to closing this deal

01:10:58.900 --> 01:11:00.440
and you're going to
introduce a new buyer?

01:11:00.510 --> 01:11:03.340
I can't just stand by and
watch as something I love

01:11:03.380 --> 01:11:05.610
- is turned into a parking lot.
- Condos.

01:11:05.650 --> 01:11:07.750
It means a lot to me, Charles.

01:11:07.810 --> 01:11:10.610
And if I think I can
save it, I have to try.

01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:17.450
Sorry about that.

01:11:17.490 --> 01:11:20.160
Look, I appreciate your
passion, I really do.

01:11:20.190 --> 01:11:22.260
But I'm afraid, the gardens,

01:11:22.300 --> 01:11:24.730
it just didn't seem like
a worthwhile investment.

01:11:26.530 --> 01:11:29.100
You said that you visited
my shop recently.

01:11:29.140 --> 01:11:30.970
Were you ordering that
corsage for you wife?

01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:32.400
Yeah, that's right.

01:11:32.470 --> 01:11:34.440
That's not one of our
standard arrangements,

01:11:34.470 --> 01:11:36.740
which means you selected
those flowers yourself.

01:11:36.780 --> 01:11:39.780
Yeah, that's true.

01:11:39.810 --> 01:11:41.880
Can I ask why you picked
the ones you did?

01:11:41.910 --> 01:11:45.820
Well, I picked the orchid
because, um,

01:11:45.850 --> 01:11:50.090
well, it reminded me of Greece.

01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:53.820
That's, uh... that's where
I first met my wife.

01:11:53.860 --> 01:11:57.060
And, uh, the carnation,

01:11:57.100 --> 01:12:01.900
that was the same colour
as the dress she was wearing

01:12:01.930 --> 01:12:04.700
the first time
I looked into her eyes.

01:12:04.770 --> 01:12:08.570
What about the red and
white swirled rose?

01:12:08.610 --> 01:12:09.740
[sighing]

01:12:09.810 --> 01:12:12.510
Well, I chose that because...

01:12:12.580 --> 01:12:17.050
for as long as I have known her,

01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:20.120
my wife's always been a little
bit of a mystery to me.

01:12:22.390 --> 01:12:24.920
You chose those flowers
because they spoke to you.

01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:26.760
They transported you somewhere.

01:12:26.790 --> 01:12:30.630
Yeah.
Yeah, they did.

01:12:30.660 --> 01:12:34.030
That's what the botanical
gardens does for others;

01:12:34.070 --> 01:12:36.130
it finds beauty from
all over the world

01:12:36.170 --> 01:12:38.370
and brings it here
for people to enjoy

01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:42.040
and share with
the ones they love.

01:12:42.110 --> 01:12:44.240
I know that
investing in the gardens

01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:47.710
might seem like a bit of a risk,

01:12:47.780 --> 01:12:49.950
but I think that most
important things in life

01:12:49.980 --> 01:12:52.650
involve some risk.

01:12:52.690 --> 01:12:56.320
And if it means we can hold
onto something precious,

01:12:56.390 --> 01:13:00.820
isn't that a leap worth taking?

01:13:09.670 --> 01:13:11.030
Charles: How did it go?

01:13:11.070 --> 01:13:15.870
Well, I made my case.
He promised to consider.

01:13:15.910 --> 01:13:17.570
You know I have
to call my client

01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:18.980
and fight for the deal, right?

01:13:19.010 --> 01:13:20.380
I do.

01:13:20.410 --> 01:13:23.680
And if I win,
what happens to us?

01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:26.180
You won't.

01:13:26.250 --> 01:13:28.750
I'll call Mr. Grey
every day if I have to.

01:13:28.820 --> 01:13:30.820
In the past week, I've found

01:13:30.860 --> 01:13:33.560
that I have a lot more fight
in me than I realized.

01:13:33.590 --> 01:13:35.730
I can't let
those gardens disappear.

01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:38.660
Look, Charles...

01:13:38.730 --> 01:13:41.600
You don't have to say it.

01:13:41.670 --> 01:13:44.270
It's not gonna work out, is it?

01:13:47.110 --> 01:13:48.940
I'm sorry.

01:13:48.970 --> 01:13:51.010
Don't be.

01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:54.680
You know, that night
at the gala,

01:13:54.710 --> 01:13:58.450
I'd never had that before.

01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:03.290
It was...
It was really special to me.

01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:07.960
And you were
this wonderful dream.

01:14:07.990 --> 01:14:11.660
That is the
problem with dreams...

01:14:11.700 --> 01:14:14.300
eventually you gotta wake up.

01:14:16.470 --> 01:14:18.100
I guess so.

01:14:18.170 --> 01:14:21.240
Take care. Okay.

01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:26.680
I have to go make
about a dozen calls

01:14:26.710 --> 01:14:28.610
that all involve
a lot of yelling in my ear.

01:14:30.750 --> 01:14:32.850
Bye.

01:14:42.090 --> 01:14:44.190
[sighing]

01:14:44.230 --> 01:14:46.460
[phone ringing]

01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:49.230
Come on, Henry, pick up.

01:14:49.270 --> 01:14:50.670
[phone ringing]

01:14:50.700 --> 01:14:52.000
[phone ringing]

01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:54.200
Woman on PA:
<i>Now boarding Flight 214</i>

01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:56.370
<i>to Phoenix, Arizona.</i>

01:14:56.410 --> 01:14:58.240
Hello?

01:14:58.280 --> 01:15:01.180
Helen: <i>It was you, wasn't it?
Who got me the painting?</i>

01:15:01.210 --> 01:15:02.650
Helen?

01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:04.950
Wasn't it?

01:15:04.980 --> 01:15:07.920
Well, you were
so upset you lost it.

01:15:07.990 --> 01:15:12.220
[sighing]
How did you track it down?

01:15:12.260 --> 01:15:14.760
<i>I still have the guest list.</i>

01:15:14.830 --> 01:15:18.000
Look, uh, Helen, I'm literally
about to get on the plane.

01:15:18.060 --> 01:15:19.530
Stay.

01:15:19.570 --> 01:15:23.770
What? I'm sorry,
could you say that again?

01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:28.610
<i>I want you to stay.</i>

01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:30.410
<i>I-I don't understand.</i>

01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:34.810
For the past two weeks, I've
been taking all these risks,

01:15:34.850 --> 01:15:38.020
but the one thing
I wasn't brave enough to say

01:15:38.050 --> 01:15:41.820
<i>is how I really feel about you.</i>

01:15:41.850 --> 01:15:44.590
What about Charles?

01:15:44.620 --> 01:15:47.260
<i>Uh, that wasn't meant to be.</i>

01:15:47.290 --> 01:15:51.230
Woman on PA: <i>Final boarding call for Flight
214 to Phoenix, Arizona.</i>

01:15:51.260 --> 01:15:52.800
I-I gotta go, Helen.

01:15:52.830 --> 01:15:54.630
Henry...

01:15:54.670 --> 01:15:56.630
Henry: <i>This is a lot to
take in right now, okay?</i>

01:15:56.670 --> 01:15:59.500
I will call you
as soon as I land.

01:15:59.540 --> 01:16:01.710
Okay. Yeah.

01:16:01.740 --> 01:16:04.170
<i>Um, I'm sorry.</i>

01:16:04.210 --> 01:16:07.340
Don't be.
Have a safe flight.

01:16:07.380 --> 01:16:09.850
<i>Thanks. Bye, Helen.</i>

01:16:13.790 --> 01:16:16.220
[sighing]

01:16:19.890 --> 01:16:22.160
I'm done taking risks.

01:16:22.190 --> 01:16:23.730
What happened?

01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:25.160
I took chance after chance.

01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:27.560
I chased a masked man

01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:31.100
who turned out to be
more frog than prince.

01:16:31.140 --> 01:16:34.440
And then, I confessed
my feelings to my best friend,

01:16:34.510 --> 01:16:37.410
who promptly got on a plane and
flew across the country.

01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:41.710
Every chance I've taken
has backfired spectacularly.

01:16:41.750 --> 01:16:43.510
Well, risk alone doesn't
guarantee success.

01:16:43.580 --> 01:16:46.450
Otherwise, it would
have a different name.

01:16:48.950 --> 01:16:52.520
I know you gave me this locket
so I'd be more like her.

01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:56.030
I feel like
I've let you both down.

01:16:56.100 --> 01:16:58.060
Oh, Helen, I didn't give you
that locket to change you.

01:16:58.100 --> 01:17:01.500
I gave you that locket because
you're so much like her already.

01:17:01.530 --> 01:17:03.870
Hardly.

01:17:03.900 --> 01:17:05.840
Do you know where
she got that locket?

01:17:05.870 --> 01:17:08.840
Spain?

01:17:08.910 --> 01:17:10.840
Portugal? France?

01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:13.880
It was a gift.

01:17:13.950 --> 01:17:15.450
From who?

01:17:15.480 --> 01:17:18.680
From me.

01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:25.020
You gave her this?

01:17:25.060 --> 01:17:27.020
Uh-huh.

01:17:27.090 --> 01:17:30.860
It was the day before
she left for Paris to study,

01:17:30.900 --> 01:17:34.330
and she had packed
everything she owned,

01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:38.840
and she was going to leave
behind everything that she knew,

01:17:38.870 --> 01:17:41.100
and she was nervous.

01:17:41.140 --> 01:17:44.140
She was more nervous than
I have ever seen her.

01:17:44.180 --> 01:17:46.440
And eventually,
she confessed to me

01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:49.380
that she was having
second thoughts.

01:17:49.420 --> 01:17:52.120
But she was so fearless.

01:17:52.150 --> 01:17:56.990
Yes, but she needed a reminder,
and so did you.

01:18:00.130 --> 01:18:02.160
I had no idea.

01:18:02.190 --> 01:18:05.560
Actually, your mother never
claimed to be fearless.

01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:08.800
[chuckling]
She used to say she had pluck.

01:18:08.830 --> 01:18:11.330
I see that in you.

01:18:13.970 --> 01:18:18.580
Have I ever thanked you?

01:18:18.610 --> 01:18:21.180
For everything
you've done for me?

01:18:21.210 --> 01:18:26.150
Oh, Helen, watching you grow up

01:18:26.190 --> 01:18:28.950
has been the greatest single
pleasure of my life.

01:18:32.830 --> 01:18:36.130
You are meant for great things.

01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:38.600
Now, you just
have to believe it.

01:18:41.130 --> 01:18:43.370
Carol, you have a phone call.

01:18:46.510 --> 01:18:48.710

Well, we have one last
order for tonight.

01:19:14.900 --> 01:19:17.030
The botanical gardens?

01:19:17.070 --> 01:19:18.670
Mm-hmm. Last minute
Valentine's bouquet.

01:19:18.740 --> 01:19:20.600
Are you up for it? Or...

01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:22.570
No, no, I'm fine.

01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:24.110
Promise.

01:19:24.140 --> 01:19:26.610
Okay. I'll tell you what,
you do the arrangement,

01:19:26.650 --> 01:19:27.980
I'll do the card. Deal?

01:19:28.010 --> 01:19:30.450

Oh, um, I ran into Mr. Gregson
at the wedding today.

and...

01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:29.700
somewhere along the way,
you became even more.

01:21:35.010 --> 01:21:37.370
I mean, for a long time,
you were the one that got away.

01:21:37.410 --> 01:21:41.480
But then, suddenly, you came
barrelling back into my life...

take a leap myself, so...
