WEBVTT

00:09.576 --> 00:11.678
I just want
to tell you guys something.

00:13.013 --> 00:14.748
Deneia:
Nothing bad, I hope.

00:14.848 --> 00:16.649
- Yeah.
- Come on.

00:18.685 --> 00:22.022
I mean, it's no secret that
Karen and I had a connection.

00:22.088 --> 00:25.025
And so her not being here --

00:25.091 --> 00:29.896
It doesn't make much sense
to me to stick around.

00:29.996 --> 00:33.199
- Oh, come on.
- Oh.

00:35.368 --> 00:38.171
Perhaps Karen and I can find
a way to reconnect

00:38.238 --> 00:39.706
and kind of figure that out.

00:39.773 --> 00:42.208
You know, I'm very interested
in pursuing that.

00:42.275 --> 00:43.843
So that's
what I'm gonna do.

00:43.910 --> 00:46.279
You're a good man.

00:46.379 --> 00:48.948
And I'm glad to meet you, and
now I know that there's men out

00:49.049 --> 00:53.953
there that are amazing fathers,
and it gives me hope.

00:54.054 --> 00:56.056
I got to stay away
from her because she...

00:58.091 --> 01:00.026
That was really nice.
Thank you.

01:00.093 --> 01:02.028
I've gotten what I think

01:02.095 --> 01:04.097
I was supposed to get
from coming here.

01:04.197 --> 01:06.466
Actually, I've gotten that
and a hell of a lot more.

01:06.566 --> 01:07.901
Bye.

01:07.967 --> 01:09.402
- Bye, Troy.
- Bye, Troy.

01:09.469 --> 01:11.404
- See you on the backside.
- We love you.

01:11.471 --> 01:14.307
I feel whole and complete
about the connections

01:14.407 --> 01:16.209
that I've made
with my new friends,

01:16.276 --> 01:17.544
and certainly with Karen.

01:17.610 --> 01:18.945
Thank you, Scotty.

01:19.045 --> 01:20.313
You got it, Petrick.

01:20.413 --> 01:22.048
I can see myself
falling in love with Karen.

01:22.115 --> 01:24.417
And so I'm just ready
to -- to move forward

01:24.484 --> 01:26.486
and take the next step
towards that.

01:41.768 --> 01:45.505
Leaving the house,
I know it's the right decision,

01:45.605 --> 01:48.608
but it's just bittersweet
to leave these great people.

01:48.675 --> 01:53.313
And I'm also unbelievably
excited to see Noah

01:53.413 --> 01:56.349
and see how he is
and how things have been going.

02:04.791 --> 02:06.359
- It's your dad.
- Your dad is here, bro.

02:06.459 --> 02:09.195
Hey.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.833
Oh.

02:13.933 --> 02:15.702
Whoa!

02:15.802 --> 02:16.936
Hey, guy.

02:17.003 --> 02:18.338
How you doing, man?

02:18.438 --> 02:19.606
It's nice to see you.

02:19.672 --> 02:21.374
It's freaking me out
seeing you a little bit.

02:21.474 --> 02:23.209
I feel like
you've gotten bigger.

02:23.309 --> 02:25.945
The fact that my dad is
leaving Second Chance Retreat,

02:26.012 --> 02:28.014
it means I'm going home.

02:28.114 --> 02:30.216
I feel upset about it.

02:30.316 --> 02:32.685
But whatever my dad
needs from me, I'll do.

02:32.785 --> 02:34.888
So, Dad,
how was your thing, bro?

02:34.988 --> 02:36.022
How you been?

02:36.122 --> 02:37.323
- How's your thing?
- Yeah.

02:37.390 --> 02:38.791
I don't know
if you noticed.

02:38.858 --> 02:40.860
I kind of actually already
know the answer to that.

02:40.960 --> 02:42.629
Oh, my God!
Look at that.

02:42.695 --> 02:44.564
Yeah. Yeah.

02:44.664 --> 02:45.698
Dude, you don't understand.

02:45.798 --> 02:47.534
14 hours a day,
we watch you.

02:47.634 --> 02:49.569
I know everything about you.

02:49.669 --> 02:51.704
And now I see you
in a whole different light.

02:51.804 --> 02:53.206
I don't even know
if you're my dad anymore.

02:53.306 --> 02:55.175
Okay, that's weird.

02:55.241 --> 02:57.377
This thing. You guys.
Yeah. Okay.

02:57.477 --> 02:59.078
Okay, now it's starting
to make sense.

02:59.179 --> 03:00.580
But I'm like,

03:00.680 --> 03:04.217
"So you guys have heard
everything, seen everything."

03:04.317 --> 03:07.253
And part of me is like,
"I mean,<i> everything</i> everything?"

03:07.353 --> 03:09.422
What's been going on
since I got here?

03:09.522 --> 03:14.093
We've been spying on you guys
and meddling and manipulating

03:14.194 --> 03:16.863
all the different
relationships in the house.

03:16.930 --> 03:20.533
So that means I actually
screwed up plenty with you.

03:20.600 --> 03:21.935
So you were the reason

03:22.035 --> 03:23.903
I kept getting never picked
in the beginning?

03:25.038 --> 03:26.206
It's like on "The Truman Show"

03:26.272 --> 03:27.607
when he opens a door
and he's like,

03:27.707 --> 03:29.442
"Oh, shit, I'm on a movie set."

03:29.542 --> 03:31.945
I mean, that's kind of
how it felt a little bit like.

03:32.045 --> 03:33.780
I-I always had this feeling

03:33.880 --> 03:36.049
I was like a rat trapped
in a maze,

03:36.115 --> 03:37.450
and it turns out I kind of was.

03:37.550 --> 03:39.085
And they were the ones
moving the cheese around.

03:39.185 --> 03:40.720
I'm like, "What is going on
with all this stuff?"

03:40.787 --> 03:42.288
Yeah, the Jimmy date.

03:42.388 --> 03:43.556
That was our fault.

03:43.623 --> 03:45.758
We messed up, bro.
We did not think.

03:45.858 --> 03:48.628
When Jimmy first started
third-wheeling your guys' date,

03:48.728 --> 03:50.797
we were laughing our asses
off.

03:50.897 --> 03:53.800
The apartment complex
I'm staying in, the alarm

03:53.900 --> 03:56.135
went off
at 5:00 a.m. today.

03:56.236 --> 03:58.271
What?

04:00.940 --> 04:02.041
Would it be, like, so rude

04:02.108 --> 04:04.043
if I just had, like,
a taste of that?

04:04.110 --> 04:05.812
Yes, because this
is, like, our date.

04:05.912 --> 04:09.749
You guys are responsible
for that debacle. Okay.

04:09.816 --> 04:13.386
Dad, it was unbearable, dude.
And I was like, "No, no!"

04:13.453 --> 04:16.456
It went a long ways towards --
A lot of my anxiety, too,

04:16.556 --> 04:18.324
about everything that's been
happening was kind of relieved

04:18.424 --> 04:21.561
in a weird way.
It was like, "Oh, I get it."

04:21.628 --> 04:24.497
Karen leaving abruptly
was, like, a big shock.

04:24.597 --> 04:25.798
I don't want to pull you
out of here

04:25.898 --> 04:27.166
'cause it sounds like
you guys

04:27.267 --> 04:28.668
are all really close friends
and everything,

04:28.768 --> 04:30.937
but there's nothing else
for me to pursue here,

04:31.004 --> 04:34.340
and so, yeah,
time to head out.

04:34.440 --> 04:38.845
Alex:
If Troy's journey was over,
that meant Noah's was, so...

04:38.945 --> 04:42.515
I was expecting it,
but something inside of me

04:42.615 --> 04:48.488
is hoping that something happens
to where he stays.

04:48.588 --> 04:50.456
I'm hopeful that actually,
though,

04:50.523 --> 04:53.459
there'll be a chance for Karen
and I to kind of reunite.

04:53.526 --> 04:55.695
Sooner rather than later,
in fact.

04:55.795 --> 04:59.098
Right? So sounds like
you guys concur, so...

04:59.165 --> 05:02.435
Yeah. Absolutely.

05:02.502 --> 05:04.937
So these guys are great,
but, you know,

05:05.004 --> 05:06.372
I think it's time
for them to do their thing,

05:06.472 --> 05:08.775
and you and I
are gonna go do our thing,

05:08.841 --> 05:11.311
and that's the way it goes
sometimes in life.

05:11.377 --> 05:13.546
But, I mean, the people
that are gonna stick with you

05:13.646 --> 05:15.214
are gonna stick
with you in this.

05:15.315 --> 05:16.683
I don't know how much
you guys heard,

05:16.783 --> 05:18.384
but it's one of the greatest
joys in my life.

05:18.484 --> 05:19.686
And then you get
to be my age

05:19.786 --> 05:21.354
and all of our age,
and it's like,

05:21.454 --> 05:22.822
"God, those are treasures
in your life."

05:22.889 --> 05:24.557
That's it.
That's what it's all about.

05:24.657 --> 05:25.892
- Yeah.
- Absolutely.

05:25.992 --> 05:28.061
So, I don't know
why I'm so emotional.

05:28.161 --> 05:30.029
You guys are...

05:30.129 --> 05:32.699
I'm definitely grateful
for the Second Chance Retreat

05:32.799 --> 05:37.403
because it helped my dad move on
from being a parent to,

05:37.503 --> 05:39.906
you know, being someone who has
a successful dating life.

05:40.006 --> 05:43.976
It allowed him to really
take that next step,

05:44.043 --> 05:45.845
and I'll cherish it.

05:45.912 --> 05:46.979
Favorite what?

05:51.517 --> 05:52.652
Woman:
Or is this real time?

05:52.719 --> 05:53.820
Oh, this is
a real-life Meddle?

05:57.423 --> 05:59.659
Oh, no.

05:59.726 --> 06:01.928
All right, Dad,
be careful with this, man.

06:02.028 --> 06:05.098
Yeah, obviously. I've been
on the other side of it.

06:05.198 --> 06:07.233
Okay. "Troy, you will now get

06:07.333 --> 06:11.003
to experience
your very own Meddle."

06:11.070 --> 06:13.039
Okay.

06:13.106 --> 06:15.575
"You must choose any two parents
to be interrupted

06:15.675 --> 06:18.745
by the Second Chance
Retreat sprinklers."

06:18.845 --> 06:21.114
Ohh, man.

06:21.214 --> 06:23.416
It's gonna come up. Oh, no.
I'm gonna have to watch it.

06:23.516 --> 06:26.119
Oh, God.
Ohh, man.

06:26.219 --> 06:28.254
Okay, to pick....

06:28.354 --> 06:30.757
"Who do you choose?"
You know what?

06:30.857 --> 06:34.794
So -- Okay,
so let's do your dad because

06:34.894 --> 06:37.029
he's just gonna go with it.

06:37.096 --> 06:39.298
And you know what? Let's do Kiki
because you know what?

06:39.399 --> 06:40.900
She'll just start dancing.

06:40.967 --> 06:43.536
I mean, I think
they'll see the joy in it.

06:43.603 --> 06:47.240
I choose Philip and Kiki to get
wet in the sprinklers.

06:47.306 --> 06:48.741
This is actually kind of fun.

06:48.808 --> 06:51.811
It'll be like,
"This is nice."

06:51.911 --> 06:53.746
Songs that I like
or what song speaks to me,

06:53.813 --> 06:56.149
so...I like karaoke,
and I love dancing, too.

06:56.249 --> 06:59.252
So any time I can get a chance
to dance, I'm down for it.

06:59.318 --> 07:02.321
Oh, no. They're having
a lovely conversation.

07:02.422 --> 07:03.990
Yeah, this is
how it goes, man.

07:04.090 --> 07:06.592
This is so weird.

07:06.659 --> 07:09.162
- Oh.
- Activated. All right.

07:11.264 --> 07:12.999
I can't believe
I'm part of this.

07:13.099 --> 07:16.002
The ground, the clouds
come in really fast.

07:16.102 --> 07:17.336
It moves so fast.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.505
I don't --
You know what I saw?

07:19.605 --> 07:21.674
I saw -- Oh. Okay.

07:25.745 --> 07:26.913
I think we're good.
Hey.

07:26.979 --> 07:28.514
I knew she'd like it.

07:31.751 --> 07:34.353
Ahh.
That is good.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.355
I think we want to probably
take a seat over here.

07:36.456 --> 07:37.623
You okay?

07:37.690 --> 07:39.192
I'm fine. Thank you.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.194
Maybe we should get a little
paper towel or something.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.529
Oh, okay. Yeah.
We should.

07:43.629 --> 07:46.499
Oh, man.
I feel terrible now.

07:46.599 --> 07:48.034
Aw.

07:48.134 --> 07:49.602
Please don't.
He'll be fine.

07:51.003 --> 07:53.272
Well, a lot of power you guys
had over here.

07:53.339 --> 07:56.943
That's freaking me out
a little bit, but...cool.

07:57.009 --> 07:58.711
Well, man...

07:58.811 --> 08:02.048
I got to see
what you guys have been up to.

08:02.148 --> 08:03.382
You ready to head out?

08:03.483 --> 08:06.686
Yeah. I probably should pack.
But...

08:06.786 --> 08:09.622
man, it's gonna be
an awkward goodbye, dude.

08:09.689 --> 08:12.225
Let's hug it out.

08:18.664 --> 08:22.401
Overall, I know that me
and the other kids in the house

08:22.502 --> 08:23.903
when our parents got divorced,

08:24.003 --> 08:27.206
we all kind of suffered
very similar consequences.

08:27.306 --> 08:29.242
- Love you, man.
- Nice meeting you.

08:29.342 --> 08:30.643
I can't believe
your Scott's kid.

08:30.710 --> 08:31.744
I know, right?

08:31.844 --> 08:33.212
Noah:
Being at this retreat,

08:33.312 --> 08:35.815
we have created
such a strong bond together.

08:35.882 --> 08:38.384
I'm gonna stay in contact
with all the people I've met,

08:38.484 --> 08:42.822
obviously, because they're
some of my best friends now.

08:42.889 --> 08:44.090
Nice meeting you, too.

08:44.190 --> 08:45.258
You got so much better
at ping-pong.

08:45.358 --> 08:47.760
I know.
Thanks to you guys.

08:49.161 --> 08:50.830
It was awesome
meeting you finally.

08:58.704 --> 09:00.573
You gonna be okay?

09:00.673 --> 09:02.942
Yeah.

09:03.042 --> 09:04.210
Okay.

09:04.277 --> 09:06.445
You can come help me pack.

09:06.546 --> 09:07.880
Okay. Perfect.

09:07.947 --> 09:09.348
It hurts.

09:09.415 --> 09:12.118
It hurts me so, so much

09:12.218 --> 09:14.954
because
we were falling more and more

09:15.054 --> 09:17.189
for each other every single day.

09:18.257 --> 09:21.761
Let's see what...

09:21.861 --> 09:23.429
Are you crying? Dude,
I told you not to cry.

09:23.529 --> 09:26.566
I'm trying not to.
That's why I couldn't say more.

09:26.632 --> 09:30.536
We connected like no other,
you know?

09:30.603 --> 09:33.940
I felt a really
strong connection between us.

09:34.040 --> 09:37.043
Hey, Alex,
please don't get so sad.

09:37.109 --> 09:38.477
Okay?

09:38.578 --> 09:41.414
I'm not.
I'm not.

09:41.480 --> 09:43.983
Cool. 'Cause you know I can't
handle emotions like that.

09:44.083 --> 09:45.651
I know.

09:49.822 --> 09:51.657
It's hard.

09:52.959 --> 09:54.493
I'm just --

09:54.594 --> 09:55.561
I'm sad.

09:55.628 --> 09:56.729
I don't even know
what to say.

09:56.796 --> 09:58.631
I don't have
anything to say, actually.

09:58.731 --> 10:00.066
Mm.

10:00.132 --> 10:02.068
What if I do
a little jiggy?

10:02.134 --> 10:04.503
But we live really far
from each other,

10:04.604 --> 10:07.006
so, you know, reality hits.

10:07.106 --> 10:10.009
And even though I don't like
to admit it,

10:10.109 --> 10:16.949
this probably is it
for Noah and me.

10:17.016 --> 10:18.584
Yeah.

10:18.651 --> 10:21.187
And I think that
that's hard to process.

10:21.287 --> 10:26.325
Noah and I are at such
different stages in our lives.

10:26.425 --> 10:28.694
Want to come in here?

10:28.794 --> 10:33.032
18 and 22
are very different ages.

10:35.801 --> 10:38.537
But maybe 26 and 30.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.172
There we go.

10:41.440 --> 10:44.377
We're getting in the car,
bro.

10:44.477 --> 10:46.612
Noah:
I got to learn a lot about Alex,

10:46.679 --> 10:51.017
but I'm sorry that we didn't
get more time together.

10:51.117 --> 10:54.120
We didn't know this was gonna
happen. It was really cool.

10:54.186 --> 10:56.889
It was a friendship
that just turned romantic.

10:56.989 --> 10:58.991
And those are always the best.

11:01.027 --> 11:04.230
I'm pretty sad
about leaving her behind.

11:04.330 --> 11:06.499
I know she is, too.

11:08.234 --> 11:12.238
But I can't imagine
not seeing her again.

11:33.025 --> 11:37.263
Do you have any plans
for any weekends in September

11:37.363 --> 11:39.565
that you can think of
off the top of your head?

11:39.665 --> 11:41.067
Not off the top of my head.

11:41.167 --> 11:42.768
And whenever you're coming,
I'll make sure it's free.

11:42.868 --> 11:45.104
Well, you know, I have to see
what works for Myles.

11:45.204 --> 11:46.439
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.274
But then I'll tell you.

11:48.374 --> 11:51.343
And I will obviously be talking
to you on a daily basis,

11:51.410 --> 11:52.878
so I'll let you know.

11:52.945 --> 11:55.448
I mean, is that cool with you,
or is that too much?

11:55.548 --> 11:56.782
That's too much.

11:56.882 --> 11:58.718
That's too much.
I'm joking.

11:58.784 --> 12:02.021
I'm gonna be missing you
like crazy.

12:02.088 --> 12:03.956
All right?
You make that face.

12:04.056 --> 12:06.392
But you'll see.

12:06.459 --> 12:07.793
It's your fault.

12:07.893 --> 12:09.628
What's my fault?

12:09.729 --> 12:12.298
That I care for you
so deeply.

12:12.398 --> 12:14.300
How?

12:14.400 --> 12:15.468
Mm...

12:17.136 --> 12:18.437
- Oh, hey.
- Hi, Nicole.

12:18.537 --> 12:20.206
Hi, everyone.
Good evening.

12:20.272 --> 12:22.208
Hello, hello.

12:22.274 --> 12:23.743
Wow, everyone looks lovely.

12:23.809 --> 12:24.944
Thank you.

12:25.044 --> 12:29.315
So I have four cards
for four lovely ladies.

12:29.415 --> 12:31.217
And we just --

12:31.283 --> 12:32.451
Oh, I'm, like --
I'm counting.

12:32.551 --> 12:33.886
I'm like, "One, two,
three, four."

12:33.953 --> 12:35.821
Thank you. Nice.

12:35.921 --> 12:37.556
Yay. Thanks.

12:37.623 --> 12:39.091
- There we go.
- Thank you.

12:39.158 --> 12:41.127
You're welcome.
There you go.

12:41.227 --> 12:43.662
All right.
Have a good night, everyone.

12:43.763 --> 12:46.132
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

12:46.232 --> 12:48.467
Can we open? Okay.

12:48.567 --> 12:50.936
Oh.
We all got one.

12:51.003 --> 12:52.972
It's rude to read
over people's shoulders.

12:53.072 --> 12:55.007
I'm just joking.

12:55.107 --> 12:56.675
"Stephanie,
tonight you will enjoy

12:56.776 --> 12:59.612
a romantic one-on-one date
with Joel."

12:59.678 --> 13:02.081
Ooh! Awesome!

13:02.148 --> 13:04.583
All right. "Patricia,
tonight you will enjoy

13:04.650 --> 13:07.853
a romantic
one-on-one date with Philip."

13:07.953 --> 13:09.188
- Hey!
- Nice.

13:09.288 --> 13:10.456
Very nice.

13:10.523 --> 13:12.758
"Deneia."

13:12.825 --> 13:14.627
"Tonight you will enjoy

13:14.693 --> 13:18.130
a romantic
one-on-one date with Scott."

13:18.197 --> 13:20.199
All right.

13:20.299 --> 13:22.268
- Who could my date be?
- I know.

13:24.303 --> 13:25.638
"Kiki, tonight you will enjoy

13:25.704 --> 13:28.374
a romantic one-on-one date
with Grant."

13:28.474 --> 13:30.543
I made it. I made it!
Yes!

13:30.643 --> 13:33.112
All right, so you guys --
Say, you want to go get ready?

13:33.179 --> 13:34.880
- Yes. Let's do it.
- Let's do it.

13:34.980 --> 13:36.382
Let's do it.

13:38.484 --> 13:40.152
Come on, girls.

13:40.219 --> 13:42.054
Joel:
Bring it home for us.

13:42.154 --> 13:44.390
One thing's for sure --
I'm having me some fun,

13:44.490 --> 13:46.158
'cause I'm spending with -- If
I'm hanging out with Trish,

13:46.225 --> 13:48.060
I know I'm having fun.

13:48.160 --> 13:49.795
You know you are going
to laugh.

13:49.862 --> 13:51.363
Here. Do you want this
up or down?

13:51.463 --> 13:52.498
Whatever.

13:52.565 --> 13:54.133
Well,
just a little bit.

13:54.967 --> 13:58.070
You're looking fly
tonight, girl.

14:09.982 --> 14:11.350
So look at this, right?

14:11.417 --> 14:13.352
I know. It's beautiful.

14:13.419 --> 14:15.254
Ohh, man!

14:15.354 --> 14:17.590
Look at
all these beautiful...

14:17.690 --> 14:19.191
Joel:
Let's have a seat.

14:19.258 --> 14:21.427
...plants and everything.

14:22.895 --> 14:24.997
Plants.

14:25.064 --> 14:26.365
Oh, yeah.

14:26.432 --> 14:28.767
Right now, I would say
Stephanie is the one

14:28.868 --> 14:30.436
I'm most interested.

14:30.536 --> 14:32.938
I want to get the chance
to talk to her more

14:33.038 --> 14:35.841
and see whether
there's a chance of something

14:35.908 --> 14:37.009
growing between us.

14:37.076 --> 14:38.510
What'd you think
about today?

14:38.577 --> 14:40.446
I mean, it was
pretty intense,

14:40.546 --> 14:42.081
very enlightening for me.

14:42.181 --> 14:43.282
And...

14:43.382 --> 14:44.884
I mean, just sitting across
from you,

14:44.950 --> 14:47.019
you could feel the energy of,
you know.

14:47.086 --> 14:48.888
I know at first, you were
getting pretty emotional.

14:48.954 --> 14:52.024
Oh, yeah. I couldn't...

14:52.091 --> 14:53.893
Here we go.

14:53.959 --> 14:56.962
"Brooks and Brennen, you're
being offered the chance to send

14:57.062 --> 15:00.199
in a big romantic gesture during
your parents' date tonight."

15:00.266 --> 15:02.801
Do we proceed?

15:02.902 --> 15:04.970
Both:
Yes, we wish to proceed.

15:05.971 --> 15:07.773
Both Stephanie
and my dad live in Florida,

15:07.873 --> 15:11.443
so I'm thinking if they do
have a chance to connect here,

15:11.543 --> 15:13.779
that there's a solid chance
that they might actually

15:13.879 --> 15:16.882
have a real relationship
outside of all this.

15:18.217 --> 15:19.985
You know what happened.
It just overcame me,

15:20.085 --> 15:21.587
and I just --
I probably would...

15:21.654 --> 15:22.755
- Oh!
- Oh!

15:22.821 --> 15:23.956
Look at that.

15:24.056 --> 15:27.293
Bubbles?

15:27.393 --> 15:28.494
What...

15:28.594 --> 15:30.896
Did you just magically...

15:30.963 --> 15:32.831
Is this

15:32.932 --> 15:35.100
This is not you singing?

15:35.167 --> 15:36.468
They just automatically
put bubbles?

15:36.568 --> 15:37.803
I don't know.

15:37.903 --> 15:39.338
I like it.

15:39.438 --> 15:40.839
I have a good hypothetical.

15:40.940 --> 15:43.275
If tonight the retreat ended,

15:43.342 --> 15:46.812
where would you see anything
or something, like, between us?

15:46.912 --> 15:48.280
Like, what would you
like to see?

15:48.347 --> 15:50.115
I know it's a tough question,
because it's, like,

15:50.182 --> 15:51.617
kind of
putting you on the spot, right?

15:51.684 --> 15:53.085
Well, we've just known each
other, what...

15:53.152 --> 15:54.620
Well, a few days.

15:54.687 --> 15:56.755
I mean, what I've known
about you -- You're super-fun.

15:56.822 --> 15:58.991
And you're very funny

15:59.091 --> 16:02.161
and definitely
emotionally available,

16:02.261 --> 16:04.029
and I love
all those qualities.

16:04.129 --> 16:08.600
I think I just have to feel

16:08.667 --> 16:11.003
maybe a little more romantic
connection with you.

16:11.103 --> 16:14.540
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.976
What I do know of you
and what I do feel with you

16:17.042 --> 16:21.013
is definitely a friendship
type of connection.

16:21.113 --> 16:23.649
Romantic connection?
I don't know.

16:23.716 --> 16:27.286
Right now, maybe not,
just to be honest.

16:28.854 --> 16:31.790
Watching my dad
pretty much get friend-zoned,

16:31.857 --> 16:34.994
it's not easy to watch.
That's got to be awkward.

16:35.060 --> 16:38.030
But my dad's a trouper.
He took it like a champ.

16:38.130 --> 16:39.531
- I'm just...
- Yeah.

16:39.631 --> 16:40.799
You're still relived,
though.

16:40.866 --> 16:42.201
- Aww!
- Aww!

16:42.301 --> 16:43.502
Look at them
with their jeans on.

16:43.569 --> 16:45.037
Man:
What is that -- a jean skirt?

16:45.137 --> 16:46.572
Is that what they're called?

16:46.672 --> 16:47.639
- Okay.
- Oh!

16:47.706 --> 16:48.907
You have a seat.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.909
And some wine.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.244
Do you want to just have
a little toast?

16:52.344 --> 16:53.379
Oh, let's do that.

16:53.479 --> 16:54.713
This is to new friendship,

16:54.813 --> 16:56.215
to whatever we get
out of this, and to you.

16:56.315 --> 16:57.750
You're just looking
so beautiful this evening.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.585
Thank you.

16:59.685 --> 17:00.819
As we will.

17:00.886 --> 17:02.588
Cheers.

17:02.688 --> 17:04.723
Grant:
I think the situation with Kiki
and I could be very real.

17:04.823 --> 17:06.392
I mean, it feels real,
but any time

17:06.492 --> 17:08.360
you open up yourself
and be vulnerable,

17:08.427 --> 17:10.362
there's a chance
that it could go the wrong way.

17:10.429 --> 17:13.198
You put yourself out there,
you risk being turned down.

17:13.265 --> 17:15.267
One of the things
that are important to me

17:15.367 --> 17:17.603
is to be able
to make a connection,

17:17.703 --> 17:21.173
but a connection that is, like,
rooted in interest

17:21.240 --> 17:23.709
and where someone feels like
they're your best friend.

17:23.776 --> 17:25.110
Yeah.

17:25.210 --> 17:26.745
This is, like,
just real natural.

17:26.845 --> 17:28.881
For even, like, the first day,
you kind of share my, like, sick

17:28.947 --> 17:30.783
sense of humor, I think,
like, about boogers.

17:30.883 --> 17:33.052
Yeah, I mean,
I don't necessarily get it,

17:33.118 --> 17:34.553
but I enjoy it.

17:36.055 --> 17:38.624
"Carlie and Destiny,
you are being offered the chance

17:38.724 --> 17:40.292
to send in
a big romantic gesture

17:40.392 --> 17:42.361
during your parents'
date tonight."

17:45.297 --> 17:47.032
I'm cool.
We're cool with that.

17:47.099 --> 17:49.435
Yes, we wish to proceed.

17:49.535 --> 17:52.137
- Meddle activated!
- Let's go!

17:52.237 --> 17:53.472
Woman:
Meddle activated.

17:53.572 --> 17:55.374
I'm nervous, girl.
I'm nervous.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.911
What is that?

17:58.977 --> 18:00.612
A dancer!

18:00.712 --> 18:01.980
Interesting.

18:03.315 --> 18:05.150
I love dance.
I love this, actually.

18:05.250 --> 18:06.485
- Oh, wow.
- Whoa!

18:06.585 --> 18:08.253
Oh, my God!

18:08.320 --> 18:09.621
- This is sick.
- It's kind of cool.

18:09.721 --> 18:11.490
With the light.

18:11.590 --> 18:12.758
Oh, there it is.

18:12.825 --> 18:15.327
- Aww!
- Aww!

18:20.165 --> 18:22.067
You think we should be
asking something?

18:22.134 --> 18:23.235
Mnh-mnh.

18:24.937 --> 18:26.839
I think we just sit here
and watch,

18:26.939 --> 18:31.076
and we watch,
and we smile, and we watch.

18:31.143 --> 18:33.846
But I can feel the emotion
and her emoting

18:33.946 --> 18:35.948
in her movements,
in her posturing,

18:36.014 --> 18:38.817
and I can still find
the beauty in it.

18:41.820 --> 18:43.322
Bye, girl.

18:43.422 --> 18:44.857
Sashay away.

18:44.957 --> 18:47.025
They're so cute.

18:47.126 --> 18:48.627
That was cute.

18:48.694 --> 18:50.696
That was great.

18:50.796 --> 18:52.464
That's very romantic.

18:52.531 --> 18:55.267
That's very romantic.

18:55.334 --> 18:58.704
And then checking in with,
like, my needs and asking me,

18:58.804 --> 19:00.873
do I need anything?
What can you get for me?

19:00.973 --> 19:04.810
And generally the way
I would respond to that is,

19:04.877 --> 19:08.347
"No, I'm okay.
I'm good,"

19:08.447 --> 19:12.017
but in the moment,
just say "yes."

19:12.117 --> 19:13.886
So I...

19:13.986 --> 19:16.054
I appreciate that.

19:16.155 --> 19:17.289
Aww.

19:17.356 --> 19:19.892
Hug number two?
Let's go hug...

19:23.028 --> 19:24.563
Mm.

19:24.663 --> 19:27.499
- She's so sweet.
- Ohh!

19:27.566 --> 19:29.568
I have that effect
on most women.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.005
I love it. I love
that he can be serious,

19:33.071 --> 19:35.874
but then, like,
let it be light, too.

19:35.974 --> 19:38.510
The fact
that she found someone

19:38.577 --> 19:42.047
and it's, like, happening,
like, it's really happening,

19:42.147 --> 19:44.349
I can't fully wrap
my head around it.

19:44.416 --> 19:47.719
I think they could...

19:47.819 --> 19:49.087
if you catch my drift.

19:49.188 --> 19:50.556
There's something there.

19:50.656 --> 19:55.494
What do you see possible
for us going forward or...

19:55.561 --> 19:57.529
Oh, I think
anything's possible.

19:57.596 --> 19:59.765
And that's the beauty of it.
It's --

19:59.865 --> 20:01.567
To me, one of the things
as I've gotten older,

20:01.667 --> 20:03.268
and this experience
has taught me,

20:03.368 --> 20:04.603
and especially
you start factoring in

20:04.703 --> 20:06.171
long-distance things...

20:06.238 --> 20:08.941
...is that really building
that strong bond is crucial.

20:09.041 --> 20:11.543
And I think we probably
all agree on that.

20:11.610 --> 20:14.279
And, you know, we've already
developed a great bond.

20:14.379 --> 20:16.114
And I think that can only
get stronger, you know,

20:16.215 --> 20:18.383
and that's exciting,
you know?

20:18.450 --> 20:22.054
Friendship is what will
anchor us,

20:22.120 --> 20:23.722
and I feel like
that has already started.

20:23.789 --> 20:28.293
We have such great things
in common and interests.

20:28.393 --> 20:32.197
And I really believe that we are
complementary to one another,

20:32.264 --> 20:36.802
and I'd like to explore --
explore that further.

20:36.902 --> 20:38.237
Brennen:
How are you feeling, Carlie?

20:38.303 --> 20:39.805
I'm excited.
He looks really, really happy.

20:39.905 --> 20:41.807
I'm excited for you guys.
This is so cool.

20:45.410 --> 20:46.645
She likes me.

20:46.745 --> 20:48.580
Cheers to liking you.

20:50.482 --> 20:51.817
Yeah.

20:51.917 --> 20:54.052
The more we talk and the more
I'm looking into her eyes

20:54.119 --> 20:57.155
and seeing her smile and just --
I do. I feel her aura.

20:57.256 --> 20:58.657
I feel, like,
this positive energy.

20:58.757 --> 21:00.559
I'm thinking, "I really do.
I like this girl.

21:00.626 --> 21:02.394
I like her a lot." And I think
it's the kind of thing

21:02.461 --> 21:04.730
that could turn into
something really special.

21:04.796 --> 21:06.098
Let me give you a hug.

21:08.233 --> 21:09.434
Mm...

21:09.501 --> 21:10.669
That was so much fun.

21:10.769 --> 21:12.938
I enjoyed that.
Thank you.

21:13.005 --> 21:15.340
Kiki:
This is a breath of fresh air.

21:15.440 --> 21:17.075
He is a breath of fresh air.

21:17.142 --> 21:20.746
I'm just enjoying every aspect
of meeting him,

21:20.812 --> 21:23.415
connecting with him,
getting to know him more.

21:23.482 --> 21:26.118
And that's my guy.

21:31.523 --> 21:32.858
Ah.

21:33.792 --> 21:35.193
Mm-mm-mm!

21:35.294 --> 21:37.029
Luckily, nice out.

21:37.129 --> 21:38.497
Yes.

21:43.168 --> 21:45.370
Wow. Can you believe it?

21:45.470 --> 21:46.772
Uh-uh...

21:46.838 --> 21:47.839
We've been here a while.

21:47.939 --> 21:49.541
We have.

21:49.641 --> 21:51.043
Isn't that something?

21:51.143 --> 21:52.344
It is.

21:58.984 --> 22:01.219
I'm just looking at you.
You're so beautiful.

22:04.523 --> 22:07.959
So when was the moment that
things started to turn for you?

22:09.561 --> 22:12.898
Oh, you know, it feels
like five months ago,

22:12.998 --> 22:16.702
but just when I would hear
you talk to other people

22:16.802 --> 22:21.540
about the changes that
you wanted to make in your life,

22:21.640 --> 22:25.010
and then your honesty
and how you've accepted

22:25.077 --> 22:27.379
some of the things
that you've done in the past --

22:27.479 --> 22:29.748
I think when I started
to hear those things,

22:29.848 --> 22:32.484
it made me
look at you differently.

22:32.551 --> 22:35.587
Yeah, you're right --
I have grown a lot in here.

22:35.687 --> 22:38.557
I definitely owe a lot
of that to you.

22:38.657 --> 22:40.592
I think
I'm a much better man for it.

22:40.692 --> 22:43.095
Yeah, I'm proud of you.

22:43.195 --> 22:46.431
So...when did
you start liking me?

22:47.699 --> 22:49.601
The second I walked
through that door.

22:49.701 --> 22:50.936
Ohh.

22:51.036 --> 22:53.438
I was asked who I wanted to go
on my first date with,

22:53.538 --> 22:55.874
and I said, "All
of these women are beautiful

22:55.941 --> 22:58.910
and seem amazing,
but absolutely Deneia."

22:59.010 --> 23:01.113
Mm.

23:01.213 --> 23:02.714
Me too.

23:02.781 --> 23:04.182
Yeah, clearly.

23:04.249 --> 23:06.218
'Cause now you're my girlfriend.
Can you believe this?

23:08.019 --> 23:09.621
You know where we go
from here, right?

23:09.721 --> 23:10.956
Where's that?

23:11.056 --> 23:12.958
We got a whole life
ahead of us,

23:13.058 --> 23:14.626
and I'm gonna spend
as much of it as I can

23:14.726 --> 23:17.129
convincing you
to be near me.

23:17.229 --> 23:18.697
But I'll, you know...

23:18.764 --> 23:20.899
I don't think you'll have
to do that much convincing.

23:20.966 --> 23:22.100
Aww.

23:22.200 --> 23:24.569
That's what I like to hear.

23:24.636 --> 23:27.105
I'm really excited
for our life together.

23:27.205 --> 23:28.874
Me too.

23:30.642 --> 23:31.977
Oh!

23:38.583 --> 23:40.152
"Meddle Time."

23:42.053 --> 23:45.657
"Alex and Myles, you're being
offered the chance to send in

23:45.757 --> 23:49.060
a big romantic gesture during
your parents' date tonight."

23:49.127 --> 23:50.996
Hell no.

23:52.597 --> 23:54.566
Bro, this shit
is so iffy, bro.

23:55.667 --> 23:57.769
My dad is a changed man.

23:57.836 --> 24:02.007
He is ready to take
the next step with Deneia.

24:02.107 --> 24:08.113
But because of MJ's hesitation
throughout this whole process,

24:08.180 --> 24:13.118
it does make me worry
about both Deneia and my dad.

24:13.185 --> 24:14.853
We might as well.
Whatever.

24:14.953 --> 24:16.655
Um, yeah.

24:16.755 --> 24:17.622
Fuck it.

24:17.689 --> 24:20.792
Yes, I wish to proceed.

24:23.795 --> 24:25.363
You know,
but I'll always try to.

24:25.464 --> 24:27.199
Yeah.

24:27.299 --> 24:29.367
and compassion you need
and deserve.

24:29.468 --> 24:31.036
Ooh!

24:31.136 --> 24:32.537
to support you
and encourage you.

24:32.637 --> 24:34.606
- What the hell?
- What is it?

24:35.807 --> 24:37.375
- Oh, wow.
- Whoa.

24:39.044 --> 24:40.812
I was just gonna give you
the line, too.

24:40.879 --> 24:41.847
Oh, shut up.

24:41.947 --> 24:43.448
What in the hell?!

24:45.383 --> 24:47.853
About, like,
what I said today.

24:47.953 --> 24:48.887
You know...

24:48.987 --> 24:50.388
It's not romantic.

24:54.626 --> 24:56.061
We're supposed to look.

25:02.300 --> 25:03.635
I can hit that.

25:03.702 --> 25:05.904
Sounds beautiful.

25:10.342 --> 25:12.177
That's so awkward.

25:12.244 --> 25:15.981
It's like a musical dude
just popped out of nowhere...

25:16.047 --> 25:17.482
mid-convo.

25:20.485 --> 25:21.820
Yo.

25:21.887 --> 25:23.588
Good job, buddy.

25:23.688 --> 25:25.824
That was good.

25:25.891 --> 25:27.659
Nice dreads, too.
Those are clean.

25:30.028 --> 25:31.663
Wow.

25:45.010 --> 25:46.411
- Hey!
- Hello.

25:51.249 --> 25:52.851
Did you guys miss me?

25:52.918 --> 25:53.919
Yes.

25:54.019 --> 25:56.454
All right.
I missed you guys.

25:56.555 --> 25:59.591
You guys are looking
very dapper.

25:59.691 --> 26:00.926
How you guys been?

26:01.026 --> 26:02.027
Good. How are you?

26:02.093 --> 26:03.728
The beard grew in, Scott?

26:03.795 --> 26:06.264
Came in here a boy.
I'm leaving a man.

26:08.633 --> 26:10.936
Joel looks
like he owns an NBA team.

26:12.070 --> 26:13.638
I don't know
what's happening.

26:13.738 --> 26:15.974
How's it been? Catch me up.
Fill me in.

26:16.074 --> 26:18.944
Oh, well, Grant and I
have connected.

26:21.246 --> 26:23.815
- Wow. That was quick.
- It didn't take long.

26:23.915 --> 26:25.884
That's what happens
when you're vulnerable.

26:27.319 --> 26:29.220
Note to self --
Be vulnerable. Okay.

26:29.287 --> 26:31.723
Exactly.

26:31.790 --> 26:34.292
Anybody else
feeling the love?

26:34.392 --> 26:36.661
Maybe.

26:36.761 --> 26:39.331
Perhaps.

26:39.431 --> 26:41.433
I got me a girlfriend.

26:41.499 --> 26:42.834
- Whoo!
- Ahh!

26:45.770 --> 26:47.973
I love to see it.

26:48.073 --> 26:49.808
Okay, look at you.
Are you blushing?

26:49.908 --> 26:51.843
Maybe a little bit.

26:51.943 --> 26:53.111
I'm a happy man.

26:53.178 --> 26:54.646
That's the Deneia effect.

26:58.583 --> 27:01.019
Listen, the confidence level
is high.

27:01.119 --> 27:03.488
I'm feeling. Okay.
All right.

27:03.588 --> 27:05.690
Well, before your time
at the retreat comes to an end,

27:05.790 --> 27:09.094
we have one more group activity
for you guys.

27:09.160 --> 27:12.263
There is a van waiting outside
to take you

27:12.330 --> 27:13.865
to our next location.

27:13.965 --> 27:15.533
So if you guys
get on up...

27:15.634 --> 27:17.535
- I'm ready to go now.
- Let's do this.

27:17.636 --> 27:18.770
Finally.

27:18.837 --> 27:20.038
Ladies first.
There we go.

27:22.674 --> 27:25.377
Oh, my God.

27:25.477 --> 27:28.346
What's it gonna be?

27:32.784 --> 27:33.852
Mama is proud.

27:33.952 --> 27:35.887
- Woman:
- Okay. Fun day.

27:35.987 --> 27:38.723
- All right!
- Look at this. Yeah!

27:38.823 --> 27:39.791
Whoo!

27:39.858 --> 27:41.159
We get out.

27:41.226 --> 27:42.560
I mean,
look at this thing.

27:42.661 --> 27:45.697
We are gonna rock tonight!

27:45.797 --> 27:47.866
We're breaking free.

27:49.534 --> 27:50.502
Unh!

27:50.568 --> 27:53.238
Oh, wow!

28:00.845 --> 28:02.814
I was putting on my shoe,
and the biggest bug

28:02.881 --> 28:05.016
just came
crawling out of it onto me.

28:05.083 --> 28:06.418
Oh, heck to the no.

28:06.518 --> 28:07.919
That's a good way
to start your day.

28:12.824 --> 28:14.759
I wonder
where our parents are.

28:14.859 --> 28:18.163
What happened?
Like, no one's onscreen.

28:18.229 --> 28:19.431
So weird.

28:19.531 --> 28:20.765
Where are our parents?

28:24.335 --> 28:26.204
Have you ever waxed
your nostril hairs?

28:26.271 --> 28:30.108
No, because I saw everyone's
Q-tips getting stuck in them.

28:30.208 --> 28:31.443
Oh, yeah.

28:35.747 --> 28:37.849
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

28:37.916 --> 28:38.950
Ah!

28:39.050 --> 28:40.785
Oh!
Where are we going?

28:40.885 --> 28:42.587
What are we doing?

28:47.392 --> 28:48.727
- What the...

28:48.793 --> 28:50.295
Oh, shit.

28:53.431 --> 28:55.700
Oh, my God.
