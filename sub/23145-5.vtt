WEBVTT

00:02.769 --> 00:05.938
Damn it! Ever since Langley Falls
approved medical marijuana,

00:06.006 --> 00:07.806
this whole town has
gone straight to hell.

00:07.874 --> 00:10.342
Uh-oh, looks like Stan is hot.

00:10.411 --> 00:11.543
Damn right, I'm hot!

00:11.612 --> 00:13.545
Crime is up, the economy is down.

00:13.614 --> 00:14.679
Look at this.

00:14.748 --> 00:16.148
They're even reporting
about how stoned this

00:16.216 --> 00:19.417
Dow Jones character is
instead of actual news.

00:19.486 --> 00:22.354
Potheads are so stupid, Stan.

00:22.423 --> 00:24.823
- So stupid.
- Oh, he's on his feet.

00:24.891 --> 00:26.558
Why did the pothead cross the road?

00:26.627 --> 00:28.560
He doesn't remember.
Well, I'll tell you one thing.

00:28.629 --> 00:31.496
It wasn't to get to his job
like the hardworking chicken.

00:31.565 --> 00:32.616
Kick it!

00:34.554 --> 00:35.768
What's the difference between a pothead

00:35.836 --> 00:37.169
and a working man?

00:37.237 --> 00:38.771
A working man works, man.

00:38.839 --> 00:41.906
A pothead puts pots in his head,
Judge Dredd.

00:41.976 --> 00:43.042
Kick it!

00:43.844 --> 00:47.111
Mr. S, this is hilarious.

00:47.113 --> 00:48.446
Why the hell are you laughing?

00:48.515 --> 00:51.249
I'm sorry,
I thought this was a funny time.

00:51.318 --> 00:52.851
Is this a sad time?

00:53.153 --> 00:55.454
I'm making fun of you, Jeff.
You're a pothead.

00:55.522 --> 00:58.791
If we can't laugh at ourselves,
who can we laugh at?

00:58.859 --> 01:00.124
Other people, Jeff.

01:00.126 --> 01:02.327
I'm sorry. I'm a little high.

01:02.329 --> 01:04.328
Oh, my God, you're such a loser.

01:04.397 --> 01:06.398
Hey, how do you get a
pothead to suck your [BLEEP]

01:06.467 --> 01:07.666
Stick it in a bong.

01:07.734 --> 01:08.866
Kick it!

01:09.936 --> 01:11.404
Can he even say that?

01:11.439 --> 01:13.738
He's a bad, bad man!

01:48.375 --> 01:49.641
Hey, Dennis.

01:49.710 --> 01:52.244
I'll take a pack of
Tommie Tokes blunt wraps

01:52.312 --> 01:54.779
and however much shake this gets me.

01:54.781 --> 01:56.781
Hey, Jeff, what's got you down?

01:56.851 --> 01:58.316
It's my father-in-law.

01:58.385 --> 02:00.719
He thinks I'm a loser
because I smoke weed.

02:00.787 --> 02:02.921
Well, that must mean he
thinks Steve Jobs, Bill Gates,

02:02.989 --> 02:05.257
and Kirsten Dunst are losers, too.

02:05.325 --> 02:07.526
They're all well-known marijuana users.

02:07.594 --> 02:10.461
Really?
Ah, I wish I knew that this morning.

02:10.531 --> 02:12.064
He loves Kirsten Dunst.

02:12.132 --> 02:13.331
He thinks he saw her in Prague

02:13.400 --> 02:15.400
once when he was
backpacking through Europe,

02:15.402 --> 02:17.402
but he's got no proof
and the story changes

02:17.404 --> 02:18.537
every time he tells it.

02:18.605 --> 02:20.805
Dennis, turn on the TV.

02:20.875 --> 02:23.942
They're talking about weed on the news.

02:25.546 --> 02:28.346
Tommie Tokes, the elusive marijuana-eer

02:28.415 --> 02:30.482
has hidden four golden rolling papers

02:30.551 --> 02:32.417
inside packs of his blunt wraps.

02:32.419 --> 02:34.086
Winners and a guest will get a tour

02:34.154 --> 02:36.288
of his mysterious weed factory,

02:36.356 --> 02:39.023
so put down that Fiery Doritos Loco Taco

02:39.093 --> 02:41.293
and get your stoned
ass to the dispensary.

02:41.362 --> 02:42.761
Give me all the packs you got!

02:42.829 --> 02:44.797
I also would like all your packs.

02:46.433 --> 02:48.032
Tommie Tokes' factory.

02:48.034 --> 02:53.037
No one ever goes in and no
one ever comes out, until now.

02:53.039 --> 02:54.639
This is our objective...

02:54.641 --> 02:57.509
a cannabis goodie of epic proportions.

02:57.578 --> 03:00.112
The Everlasting Edible.

03:00.180 --> 03:01.980
Tommie Tokes has been developing it,

03:02.048 --> 03:05.250
and this thing gets you
messed up from the dress up,

03:05.319 --> 03:07.986
from sun up to sunset.

03:08.054 --> 03:09.654
- For life!
- For life?

03:09.723 --> 03:11.390
We've got to destroy that thing.

03:11.458 --> 03:15.193
Exactly, Smith,
but I'll be the one to destroy it.

03:15.262 --> 03:17.730
I've got a whole evening planned.

03:17.798 --> 03:23.868
I bought MLB 19 and I'm going
to play a season as the Rangers.

03:23.938 --> 03:28.607
But I'm going to give all
the players girls' names.

03:28.675 --> 03:32.277
Your job is to find me
one of these blunt wraps.

03:32.279 --> 03:34.479
It's the only way to get inside.

03:34.481 --> 03:37.215
This is your only priority.

03:37.284 --> 03:39.417
Hey, Stan,
I've been meaning to tell you...

03:39.486 --> 03:42.554
You can see the outline of your
penis through your sweatpants.

03:42.623 --> 03:45.890
I see you in the gym every
morning and it's... distracting.

03:45.892 --> 03:47.960
You did the right thing
coming to me with this.

03:48.028 --> 03:49.894
And what's more,
you picked the right time.

03:49.896 --> 03:52.164
You think it's something
with the pants or the penis?

03:54.168 --> 03:56.168
I'm leaning penis, Stan.

04:00.374 --> 04:03.442
Please be gold. Please be gold.

04:05.245 --> 04:06.911
Dang it. Brown.

04:06.913 --> 04:08.947
Ugh, so close.

04:10.785 --> 04:12.651
You can't do that on television...

04:12.719 --> 04:15.988
is my favorite television
show of all time.

04:16.055 --> 04:17.322
Okay, got to go, Mom.

04:17.391 --> 04:20.192
Next time we'll talk about
what your favorite show is.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.066
In a shocking show of motivation,

04:28.135 --> 04:30.669
Langley's potheads are
lined up around the block

04:30.737 --> 04:32.671
hoping to score a golden blunt wrap,

04:32.739 --> 04:36.274
but their chances grow slimmer
as the first one has been found.

04:36.343 --> 04:40.212
What is your name and where did
you find your golden blunt wrap?

04:40.280 --> 04:42.414
My name is Pube Face and, um,

04:42.483 --> 04:44.949
it's actually a really crazy story.

04:44.951 --> 04:48.152
- My...
- Your name is Pube Face?

04:54.961 --> 04:57.295
Aah!

05:05.772 --> 05:07.506
We interrupt this
midmorning screening of

05:07.574 --> 05:09.107
"Showgirls: The Director's Cut"

05:09.176 --> 05:12.777
to inform you the second
blunt wrap has been found.

05:12.779 --> 05:14.246
Larry, how excited were you

05:14.314 --> 05:16.381
when you found the second gold wrap?

05:16.450 --> 05:19.852
Oh, man,
it was like the first time I heard

05:19.920 --> 05:22.855
Steely Dan, man.
You ever listen to them?

05:22.923 --> 05:24.523
I'm a weatherman, Larry.

05:24.591 --> 05:27.325
I only listen to the sweet,
sweet beeping

05:27.394 --> 05:29.394
of my Doppler 5000.

05:29.463 --> 05:32.931
Oh, and "Black Cat"
by Janet Jackson for sex.

05:36.403 --> 05:40.405
Faster! I'd help, but there's no stairs!

05:40.407 --> 05:42.074
The third winner is this lady.

05:42.142 --> 05:44.342
What's up? My name is Angie.

05:44.411 --> 05:46.010
I smoke weed before every meal...

05:46.012 --> 05:49.814
breakfast, lunch, dinner,
brunch, fourth meal,

05:49.816 --> 05:52.150
second lunch, third breakfast.

05:52.219 --> 05:54.352
Well, this lady's gross.

05:54.421 --> 05:56.889
Thanks, Memphis. She was gross.

05:56.957 --> 05:59.558
With three gone,
that means there's just one

05:59.626 --> 06:01.960
gold blunt wrap left.

06:02.028 --> 06:03.962
- Babe.
- Jeff.

06:04.714 --> 06:05.898
Jeff.

06:07.000 --> 06:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:14.374 --> 06:18.310
Hey, bong brain,
you have the last gold blunt wrap!

06:18.379 --> 06:19.712
Oh, my God, I won!

06:19.780 --> 06:22.447
I'm going to Tommie Tokes' factory!
Hoo-hoo!

06:22.449 --> 06:24.316
And you get to take a friend.

06:24.385 --> 06:25.984
Jeff, you have to take me.

06:26.052 --> 06:27.986
I can't tell you why,
but it's very important.

06:28.054 --> 06:29.922
But Mr. S, you hate weed.

06:29.990 --> 06:33.258
That would be like taking
Garfield to a Mondays factory.

06:33.327 --> 06:34.659
Plus, I should take Hayley.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.929
Actually,
it sounds like a lot of walking.

06:36.997 --> 06:39.197
Maybe you could just describe
it to me when you get back.

06:39.266 --> 06:40.999
You make a strong argument.

06:41.068 --> 06:45.070
If I wasn't thinking about you before,
I definitely am now.

06:45.139 --> 06:46.338
Mr. S, rebuttal?

06:46.407 --> 06:49.474
I'm prepared to let
you sleep with my wife.

06:49.543 --> 06:51.944
Jeff, you'd be crazy
not to take that deal.

06:52.012 --> 06:54.146
Okay, I've decided.

06:54.214 --> 06:55.880
I'm taking Hayley.

06:55.882 --> 06:57.482
I don't want to go. I'm not going.

06:57.484 --> 07:00.485
In that case, it looks like Mr. S

07:00.554 --> 07:02.687
is going to the weed factory!

07:02.756 --> 07:05.591
- Yes.
- Now let's celebrate.

07:07.762 --> 07:09.227
Hey!

07:09.296 --> 07:11.830
Oh, hell no!

07:11.898 --> 07:13.966
- Now you done it! Yah!
- Aah!

07:19.840 --> 07:21.372
Glad you're here, Mr. S.

07:21.374 --> 07:24.309
I think this is really gonna
open your mind to marijuana.

07:24.377 --> 07:26.445
Who knows?
You could be the next Bill Gakes,

07:26.513 --> 07:28.647
Stakes Jobs, or Kirstle Durstle.

07:28.715 --> 07:31.850
Or I could be the man who
takes down Tommie Tokes.

07:31.919 --> 07:32.928
What's that, Mr. S?

07:32.986 --> 07:36.321
I-I was just, uh,
talking about, uh, this.

07:39.192 --> 07:40.992
Your kisses saved you again.

07:41.061 --> 07:42.661
But how many more times?

07:42.729 --> 07:45.864
One day, your luck will run out,
Smith, and Jeff will discover

07:45.933 --> 07:47.799
that you're trying to
take down Tommie Tokes.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.266
What's that, Mr. S?

07:50.404 --> 07:52.338
That's him.

07:54.541 --> 07:57.142
I'm mother[BLEEP] Tommie Tokes.

07:57.210 --> 08:00.011
That's just my homey that holds my box.

08:02.750 --> 08:05.016
Where my winners at? Let's roll.

08:06.820 --> 08:10.755
Welcome to the official
tizzle of my merry factizzle.

08:10.824 --> 08:12.691
Interesting fact before we begin...

08:12.759 --> 08:15.360
nobody knows when the factory was built

08:15.428 --> 08:17.028
or anything about it, really.

08:17.097 --> 08:18.630
Fascinating.

08:18.632 --> 08:21.300
Mr. Tokes,
will we be seeing edibles on the tour?

08:21.368 --> 08:23.635
Possibly of the everlasting variety?

08:23.704 --> 08:27.038
Hell yeah,
there's gonna be edibles, Big Chin.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.640
This is a soda lock.

08:28.709 --> 08:30.709
I just have to enter the combination.

08:30.777 --> 08:33.712
Coke, Sprite, Dr. Pepper, Dew, Dew,

08:33.780 --> 08:36.047
Diet Dew, weird-ass lemonade,

08:36.049 --> 08:38.650
tricky little water button, Coke.

08:38.719 --> 08:39.993
Pepsi.

08:43.524 --> 08:46.725
Everything in this room is edible.

08:54.201 --> 08:56.935
Wow. It's actually beautiful.

09:03.811 --> 09:05.477
Try some, Mr. S.

09:05.546 --> 09:07.746
Oh, uh, is that chocolate?

09:07.815 --> 09:10.415
My doctor said I'm only
to eat bananas foster.

09:10.483 --> 09:12.151
Ow, my tooth!

09:13.754 --> 09:18.557
Fool, that area is clearly an office.

09:18.625 --> 09:20.826
Whoa, he's gonna eat it like a pelican!

09:25.366 --> 09:28.700
Oh, God, my sweet Pube Face! Help him!

09:28.702 --> 09:31.436
Chill, baby. Your boy's dead.

09:31.505 --> 09:34.373
Not even the great Patch

09:54.127 --> 09:56.928
Say, Mr. Tokes,
who are those purple fellas?

09:56.997 --> 09:59.330
Those are a native tribe from the Andes

09:59.400 --> 10:00.932
called the Snoopa Loompas.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.601
Obviously,
I can only catch the little ones

10:02.669 --> 10:04.069
'cause they don't run that fast.

10:04.137 --> 10:07.106
Now I got something
that'll blow your mind.

10:08.209 --> 10:10.742
This machine scans your
brain and determines

10:10.744 --> 10:13.212
the perfect strand of
weed for your personality.

10:13.280 --> 10:16.347
- Who wants to try?
- Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! I love weed!

10:16.349 --> 10:18.817
I love weed! I love weed! I love weed!

10:18.886 --> 10:20.085
Please!

10:20.153 --> 10:21.686
Man, I hate this lady.

10:21.755 --> 10:23.955
Why'd I make this contest random?

10:24.024 --> 10:28.293
You. I notice you didn't eat
anything in my edible meadow.

10:28.361 --> 10:30.295
I-I shouldn't.

10:30.363 --> 10:31.763
I don't really smoke the stuff.

10:31.832 --> 10:35.234
Don't smoke any stuff,
except fools who step to me.

10:35.302 --> 10:36.635
But that's just an expression.

10:36.703 --> 10:39.304
If you don't,
I'm gonna think you a narc.

10:39.372 --> 10:40.772
What mission?! Of course not!

10:40.841 --> 10:41.907
Give me that!

10:45.512 --> 10:47.045
That's the swirly thing.

10:47.114 --> 10:49.047
Love that marble.

10:49.116 --> 10:50.381
There's my mouse.

10:50.383 --> 10:52.183
Blue dots.

10:52.185 --> 10:53.318
That's my logo!

10:55.456 --> 10:57.256
Your personalized strain...

10:57.324 --> 11:00.525
C-High-A. Whatever that means.

11:00.594 --> 11:02.527
Tokes up!

11:02.596 --> 11:05.831
Whoa, you're doing it, Mr. S.

11:09.069 --> 11:10.335
That went down pretty easy.

11:10.404 --> 11:11.937
- My turn!
- Wait!

11:12.005 --> 11:13.538
The helmet needs to recharge or else...

11:17.077 --> 11:19.410
♪ Seven, six, five, and to the fo' ♪

11:19.412 --> 11:24.215
♪ This chick was super pushy,
now she's dead on the floor ♪

11:24.217 --> 11:26.885
If you follow me this way,
there's a room where I swear

11:26.954 --> 11:29.554
I saw a ghost.
I'm very glad you're all here,

11:29.623 --> 11:32.357
'cause last time,
it scared me half to death.

11:32.425 --> 11:33.892
But it was also fun in a way.

11:33.961 --> 11:38.430
Jeff, I am having a really,
really grood time.

11:38.499 --> 11:40.765
I'm having a grood time, too.

11:40.834 --> 11:43.368
Dude, what are you even talking about?

11:43.436 --> 11:44.769
We should go on an adventure.

11:44.838 --> 11:47.372
Come on, we never hang out,
just the two of us.

11:47.440 --> 11:50.175
- 'Cause usually you hate me.
- Not today.

11:50.243 --> 11:53.912
Today, I want to do something
fun with you, as friends.

11:53.981 --> 11:55.748
Come on, let's go.

11:58.519 --> 12:00.852
Beanbag chairs!

12:00.921 --> 12:04.589
Oh, so soft, bro.

12:04.658 --> 12:06.325
Look, a big red button.

12:06.393 --> 12:08.259
Press it!

12:13.400 --> 12:16.135
Jeff, we're beanbag clouds!

12:23.877 --> 12:26.611
Do you ever wish you
had a new last name?

12:26.680 --> 12:29.815
Something strong like...
like Cuccinelli.

12:29.883 --> 12:34.019
Stan Cuccinelli... an Italian man.

12:39.026 --> 12:40.491
Where are we?

12:40.493 --> 12:43.094
Whoa, check it out.

12:43.164 --> 12:45.364
A tiny velvet pillow.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.499
Think... Think about how small your head

12:47.501 --> 12:49.434
would have to be to even sleep on it.

12:49.503 --> 12:50.769
You... You'd have to...

12:50.838 --> 12:52.171
You'd have to be, like, a squirrel.

12:52.239 --> 12:54.439
God, I wish I was a squirrel.

12:54.508 --> 12:55.774
But Hayley would never let me.

12:55.843 --> 12:58.977
Yeah, you're right.
She's tough, but she's fair.

12:59.046 --> 13:00.179
Wait a minute.

13:00.247 --> 13:03.114
Look what's sleeping on
the squirrel's pillow.

13:03.184 --> 13:05.784
It's The Everlasting Edible!

13:05.853 --> 13:08.720
The rumors are true!

13:10.105 --> 13:12.457
Jeff, I got to be honest.

13:12.526 --> 13:17.128
I came here to steal this
for my job at the C.I.A.

13:17.198 --> 13:19.398
I still work there part time.

13:19.466 --> 13:22.001
But after this amazing day with you,

13:22.069 --> 13:23.869
I don't care what my boss says.

13:23.937 --> 13:25.871
I can't take it. That'd be wrong.

13:25.939 --> 13:29.008
That's really cool of you, Mr. S.

13:29.076 --> 13:30.809
Now, what do you say we get back?

13:30.878 --> 13:32.477
The way this tour's been thinning out,

13:32.546 --> 13:34.213
they might notice we're missing.

13:34.281 --> 13:35.614
Get down from there!

13:35.682 --> 13:38.016
It's too much bass for your face!

13:38.085 --> 13:40.685
I need to feel the music!

13:46.293 --> 13:48.760
Oh, God, Larry!

13:48.829 --> 13:51.296
You died the way you wanted.

13:51.364 --> 13:55.768
I'm crying for me,
but I'm happy for you.

13:58.572 --> 14:01.306
I guess that leaves Jeff.

14:01.374 --> 14:04.976
My man. Congratulations, you get...

14:04.978 --> 14:07.713
What?! One of y'all stole from me?

14:07.781 --> 14:09.047
No, we didn't!

14:09.116 --> 14:12.383
Unless you're talking
about the bathroom!

14:12.453 --> 14:14.119
I'm so sorry!

14:14.187 --> 14:16.321
I took some extra toilet paper!

14:16.389 --> 14:18.924
I thought I might need to blow my nose!

14:18.992 --> 14:21.326
You do need to blow your damn nose.

14:21.394 --> 14:23.328
You snotting all over your face.

14:23.396 --> 14:24.796
I'm not talking about you.

14:24.865 --> 14:26.665
I'm talking about him.

14:30.071 --> 14:31.402
You lied to me.

14:31.404 --> 14:33.071
We were having so much fun.

14:33.140 --> 14:34.473
We got high together!

14:34.541 --> 14:35.807
I didn't get high.

14:35.876 --> 14:37.943
Wiz kids at the lab
cooked this up to keep me

14:38.011 --> 14:39.385
from getting stoned.

14:40.614 --> 14:43.282
A big plastic bag.

14:44.751 --> 14:46.084
But your eyes... they're red.

14:46.153 --> 14:49.955
Another trick from the
wiz kids at the lab.

14:50.023 --> 14:51.089
I poke them.

14:51.158 --> 14:52.223
Take him away.

14:52.293 --> 14:54.693
Show him what we do to narcs.

14:54.762 --> 14:56.628
Jeff, we cool.

14:56.630 --> 14:58.764
Except you got to get
up out of my factory.

14:58.832 --> 15:02.968
But I was the last one. I won.

15:03.036 --> 15:04.970
I get the factory, right?

15:05.038 --> 15:07.772
Absolutely, if you can name

15:07.841 --> 15:10.575
the exact order of
sodas in my soda lock.

15:10.644 --> 15:12.644
Coke, Sprite, Dr. Pepper,
Dew, Dew, Diet Dew,

15:12.646 --> 15:14.045
lemonade, tricky little water button,

15:14.047 --> 15:15.914
Coke, Pepsi.

15:15.983 --> 15:18.917
[BLEEP] that.
I'm still not giving it to you.

15:18.986 --> 15:20.519
You can't make me.

15:24.625 --> 15:26.091
Do your worst, Tokes.

15:26.159 --> 15:28.760
I'm not afraid to die
to win the war on drugs,

15:28.762 --> 15:30.229
or also don't kill me,

15:30.297 --> 15:32.297
if you have the guts, you coward.

15:32.365 --> 15:35.034
Oh, Stan, I'm not gonna kill you.

15:35.102 --> 15:38.237
I'm gonna use this machine to
turn you into a Snoopa Loompa.

15:38.305 --> 15:40.639
How? They're indigenous
people from the Andes.

15:40.708 --> 15:44.042
That was my lie.
I created the Snoopa Loompas.

15:44.111 --> 15:47.846
Not with my penis and my sperms,
but with this machine.

15:47.915 --> 15:51.850
This will break your bones,
reorganize your internal organs,

15:51.919 --> 15:53.852
and tattoo your skin purple.

15:53.921 --> 15:56.655
It's excruciating,
but you won't feel a thing.

15:56.724 --> 15:59.753
You'll be higher than a
kite strapped to a rocket.

16:01.595 --> 16:03.929
I'd rather feel the
pain than be a pothead.

16:03.997 --> 16:05.397
Think you're tough, huh?

16:05.466 --> 16:07.466
Well, bzzzzz!

16:07.534 --> 16:09.334
Here comes the airplane!

16:09.402 --> 16:11.737
Bzzzz!

16:12.799 --> 16:14.473
That was a dirty trick.

16:14.541 --> 16:16.207
You're part devil, Tokes.

16:16.209 --> 16:18.944
Yeah, and I'm also part Dutch.

16:19.012 --> 16:20.745
Jealous?

16:25.152 --> 16:27.819
It's all jammed up!

16:27.888 --> 16:29.821
Hey, did you try to stop yourself

16:29.890 --> 16:31.356
from going through this thing?

16:31.425 --> 16:32.891
Yeah, of course.

16:32.960 --> 16:35.827
Oh, what the frig did you do that for?!

16:35.829 --> 16:37.296
Now I got to go to the machine room

16:37.364 --> 16:41.967
where everyone's always farting
and playing pranks on me.

16:42.035 --> 16:43.769
Mr. S's legs!

16:43.837 --> 16:46.638
But where's the rest of him.

16:46.640 --> 16:51.243
Wait a minute,
Mr. S is always right above his legs.

16:55.182 --> 16:56.848
Oh, my God.

16:56.850 --> 16:59.584
I always wanted to know what you
look like with your suit off.

16:59.653 --> 17:01.653
Jeff! How did you get
back in the factory?

17:01.722 --> 17:03.054
I told the front desk guy

17:03.056 --> 17:05.256
I was good friends with Emilio Estevez.

17:05.326 --> 17:08.926
He about almost tore the door
of its hinges opening it for me.

17:08.996 --> 17:10.262
Now let's get out of here.

17:11.598 --> 17:14.265
- This way.
- Wait, Jeff.

17:14.335 --> 17:16.535
Do I have time to take my shoes off?

17:16.603 --> 17:18.869
Oh, God, you're for real high.

17:18.872 --> 17:21.773
That means it's up to me
to get us out of here.

17:25.813 --> 17:29.348
Some people say smoking
weed makes you lazy.

17:29.416 --> 17:34.886
But for me,
smoking weed makes me see lasers.

17:41.895 --> 17:42.904
Whoa.

17:47.368 --> 17:49.968
Get those stoned fools!

17:50.037 --> 17:52.704
Why did I even have
this dumb factory tour?

17:52.773 --> 17:56.307
I had very little to gain
from a business perspective.

18:07.921 --> 18:08.930
Perfect.

18:08.989 --> 18:12.591
Sitting's gonna feel so good right now.

Close your eyes, Mr. Smith.

18:35.148 --> 18:36.748
- Where am I?
- Just listen to my voice.

18:36.750 --> 18:38.483

Jeff, I'm starting to freak out.

18:52.766 --> 18:54.633
How... How much longer
am I gonna be high?

18:54.701 --> 18:57.036
Uh... only a couple more minutes.

18:57.104 --> 18:58.837
Oh, thank God.

18:58.906 --> 19:00.505
Should I eat another one then?

19:00.574 --> 19:02.408
They're by the boat!

19:04.578 --> 19:05.777
It's a dead end!

19:05.779 --> 19:08.113
Jeff, promise you won't be mad,

19:08.181 --> 19:11.716
but I think I left my
sunglasses in the car boat.

19:11.785 --> 19:14.385
That's right. End of the line.

19:14.455 --> 19:16.255
See you in hell.

19:16.323 --> 19:19.124
- No, see me inhale.
- _

19:23.797 --> 19:26.865
Jeff Fischer, I've had about
enough of you vandalizing

19:26.934 --> 19:29.134
my dank-ass weed factory.

19:29.202 --> 19:30.402
Get them!

19:33.807 --> 19:34.906
Aah!

19:35.008 --> 19:36.141
Aah!

19:36.209 --> 19:38.143
You think we scared of your ass?

19:38.211 --> 19:39.244
Aah!

19:39.412 --> 19:40.713
Aah!

19:42.616 --> 19:44.616
Okay, you scared my ass!

19:44.618 --> 19:46.217
That is just gruesome.

19:46.287 --> 19:49.154
I know you were in danger,
but there was still a sense

19:49.222 --> 19:50.622
of fun and whimsy to it all.

19:50.691 --> 19:52.891
I mean, man, you took this to a really,

19:52.960 --> 19:54.960
really dark place.

19:55.028 --> 19:56.095
I give up.

20:00.901 --> 20:03.034
Where's the exit?

20:03.104 --> 20:06.571
Take my glass elevator.

20:06.640 --> 20:10.175
Did you see the size of that rip I took?

20:10.243 --> 20:12.111
It was truly epic.

20:12.179 --> 20:13.912
I love you, Jeff Fischer.

20:17.718 --> 20:20.331
It's time to go home, Mr. S.

20:21.588 --> 20:24.189
Hey, Jeff,
thanks for taking me to the factory.

20:24.257 --> 20:26.057
It's been a real fun day.

20:27.861 --> 20:30.529
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

20:30.597 --> 20:32.864
Weed does make stuff look pretty.

20:32.866 --> 20:34.666
I knew you'd come around on it.

20:34.735 --> 20:37.136
That's not what I said.
Marijuana is awful.

20:37.204 --> 20:38.937
But I am coming around on you.

20:39.006 --> 20:42.073
You were a badass in there.
You're not a loser.

20:42.075 --> 20:43.608
Thanks, Mr. S.

20:43.677 --> 20:46.545
I wonder how I'm gonna get
myself turned back into a human.

20:46.613 --> 20:49.280
You worry too much, Mr. S.

20:49.350 --> 20:51.750
Check out the earth.
It's coming so fast.

20:51.819 --> 20:54.019
Pretty chill, Mr. S.

20:54.087 --> 20:55.420
It's coming really fast.

20:55.488 --> 20:57.088
Jeff. Jeff. Jeff! Jeff!
Jeff! Jeff! Jeff! Jeff!

20:57.090 --> 20:58.957
Bye-bye! See you soon!
