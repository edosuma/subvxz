ADAMA: Previously on
Battlestar Galactica.

00:05.589 --> 00:07.006
(STARBUCK GRUNTS)

00:07.091 --> 00:09.008
If that's me lying there,
then what am I?

00:09.093 --> 00:11.386
BALTAR: She took these
from her own
mortal remains.

00:11.470 --> 00:16.849
The blood on these
dog tags is a 100%
proof-positive match

00:17.184 --> 00:19.102
for one Kara Thrace.

00:21.355 --> 00:22.438
Sam!

00:23.399 --> 00:24.399
(GRUNTS)

00:25.734 --> 00:28.027
We tried hooking
him up to the
main power grid,

00:28.112 --> 00:30.029
thought it might
reset his neural net.

00:30.114 --> 00:31.823
This has been
happening all over
the ship.

00:31.907 --> 00:33.908
Power surges,
temperature fluctuations.

00:33.992 --> 00:36.202
And now you're telling me
it's been him all along?

00:37.830 --> 00:38.913
That for me?

00:38.997 --> 00:40.998
Hera wrote the
notes to a song

00:41.083 --> 00:44.043
that my father
used to play to me
when l was a child.

00:44.128 --> 00:46.796
The same song that
led us to Earth.

00:47.047 --> 00:49.340
There's a pattern
that I can't see.

00:49.425 --> 00:51.426
But I think
that you can.

00:51.593 --> 00:54.470
So we are going
to pick it apart
until we figure it out.

00:54.930 --> 00:56.848
That's impossible.
Somebody saw her.

00:56.932 --> 00:58.099
What the hell is
going on up there?

00:58.183 --> 00:59.350
STARBUCK: Boomer took Hera.

00:59.435 --> 01:00.560
Just walked right
out of the daycare.

01:04.690 --> 01:07.066
Job well done.
You go get some rest.

01:07.151 --> 01:09.944
Don't worry.
We'll take good
care of her.

01:10.028 --> 01:11.779
HERA: Boomer. No. Boomer.

01:12.281 --> 01:15.324
If Cavil's plan all
along was to steal Hera
so he could study her,

01:15.409 --> 01:16.868
he'll take her
to the colony.

01:16.952 --> 01:19.829
It's where we and
the Centurions went
after the first war.

01:26.003 --> 01:27.879
We're abandoning ship, Tigh.

01:28.213 --> 01:29.756
Put out the orders.
I want the crew

01:29.840 --> 01:31.549
to start stripping
down Galactica.

01:31.842 --> 01:34.177
Pack in all the
weapons and gear.

01:34.261 --> 01:37.054
Let's start off-loading
civilians by tomorrow.

01:37.139 --> 01:40.850
Full crews and ordinances
transferred by the
end of the week.

01:41.059 --> 01:43.686
To Galactica,
best ship in the fleet.

01:44.521 --> 01:45.646
To Galactica.

01:49.151 --> 01:51.319
(THEME MUSIC)

03:08.730 --> 03:11.274
I've commanded
two Battlestars

03:11.608 --> 03:13.192
and three escorts
before that.

03:13.277 --> 03:14.819
Come on, Bill.
Don't be like that.

03:14.903 --> 03:16.821
There's nothing to
get all upset about.

03:16.905 --> 03:19.198
Billions of cubits
worth of equipment
entrusted to me,

03:19.283 --> 03:21.117
not to mention
the thousands of lives.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.286
It's one hour of your life.

03:23.537 --> 03:27.373
Look,
sometimes there are things
you just gotta do, all right?

03:44.933 --> 03:47.143
Do you always
drink and drive?

03:49.646 --> 03:51.856
I drink. He drives.

03:54.151 --> 03:57.236
You like having
things done for you,
don't you?

03:58.030 --> 04:01.240
It certainly beats having
to do them for yourself.

04:01.575 --> 04:03.034
(LAUGHS)

04:03.994 --> 04:05.328
Don't you?

04:05.787 --> 04:09.248
No, I prefer not
to rely on others
as much as possible.

04:10.667 --> 04:13.336
Less chance of being
let down that way.

04:21.011 --> 04:22.345
Well, since you've
allowed yourself

04:22.429 --> 04:25.681
to be in my capable
hands for this evening,

04:28.268 --> 04:30.770
here's hoping I
won't let you down.

04:32.147 --> 04:34.231
I'll drink to that, Doctor.

04:41.448 --> 04:45.952
You can... You can
call me Gaius, actually.

04:46.036 --> 04:48.621
If you want.

04:49.331 --> 04:52.708
This is crazy,
but I've actually
forgotten your name.

05:09.101 --> 05:10.851
Hello. How are you?

05:11.395 --> 05:14.522
What? What?

05:17.234 --> 05:19.360
Oh, my Gods. When was this?

05:19.653 --> 05:20.736
Oh...

05:20.821 --> 05:23.781
Well, listen, just...
I'm so sorry.

05:23.907 --> 05:27.743
If you just wait there,
and I'll be around
as soon as I can...

05:28.745 --> 05:31.038
No, please.
You have to wait.
You have to...

05:31.123 --> 05:33.040
You can't...

05:34.042 --> 05:37.086
You will wait there,
or I'll sue you
for abandonment.

05:37.170 --> 05:38.629
Yeah, I will.

05:39.923 --> 05:43.592
Well, I don't know how
long it's going to take.
Just wait.

05:43.969 --> 05:46.387

That was amazing.

06:05.949 --> 06:07.408
I'm just gonna clean
up a little bit here.

06:07.492 --> 06:09.493
Okay, Laura, no cleaning.

06:10.454 --> 06:11.454
Just a little.

06:11.538 --> 06:12.538
No, this is the last bottle,

06:12.622 --> 06:13.664
and you and I
have to share it.

06:13.749 --> 06:15.207
You promised me we'd
finish all the champagne.

06:15.292 --> 06:18.127

WOMAN: They did.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.047
What about me?

No. Pregnant girls
only get gifts.

That was lovely, Laura.
Thank you.

it's the least I could do
for my little sister.

stealer for a brother. Nice!

from you, Dad, all right?

trouble already.

don't call the cops.

changed his accent.

nurse in a row now, Dad.

how much this is costing me?

cares about now.

was brought up,
I can tell you.

to think about that.

about living on a farm

honest, hard work.

your problem, sir,

15:07.156 --> 15:10.450
but they want us to
tear the mag cellerators
from the launch tubes.

15:10.535 --> 15:13.245
Well, the civilian ships
can use them as auto-loaders.

15:13.329 --> 15:16.290
Sir, it's like we're tearing
the old girl's heart out.

15:16.374 --> 15:19.126
A Battlestar's whole purpose
is to launch Vipers.

15:19.210 --> 15:22.838
I kind of know how you feel.
Part of my heart's here, too.

15:25.174 --> 15:27.259
Tell you what,
make the cellerators

15:27.343 --> 15:29.428
the last thing
your men take out.

15:29.929 --> 15:33.640
Then turn out the
lights and let the
old girl die in peace.

15:34.434 --> 15:35.684
Yes, sir.

16:24.442 --> 16:27.402
PAULLA: Well, after the blast,
everyone else's
numbers are down,

16:27.528 --> 16:29.029
which gives us solid majority

16:29.113 --> 16:31.782
on over half
the civilian ships
in the fleet.

16:31.866 --> 16:33.158
I mean, no one else
comes even close

16:33.242 --> 16:35.619
to having that kind
of political power.

16:35.703 --> 16:37.663
Our time is here, Gaius.

16:38.706 --> 16:40.624
She's right, Gaius.

16:41.084 --> 16:43.126
The end times are approaching.

16:43.211 --> 16:46.213
Humanity's final chapter
is about to be written,

16:46.297 --> 16:49.257
and you...
You will be its author.

16:51.177 --> 16:53.804
Gaius, did you hear me?
This is it.

16:55.973 --> 16:57.641
This is it, Gaius.

17:08.945 --> 17:12.280
Are you thirsty before...

17:18.788 --> 17:21.164
What the hell
are you doing here?

17:23.459 --> 17:26.169
What's going on?
How'd you get in here?

17:27.547 --> 17:28.630
Should I go?

17:28.715 --> 17:31.049
What you should do
is go up those stairs,

17:31.134 --> 17:35.137
turn left,
hit the bedroom
and get ready.

17:42.812 --> 17:45.272
You are an intruder
in my home.

17:45.398 --> 17:47.858
I think it would be
a good idea if you left

17:47.984 --> 17:50.318
before I inform
the authorities.

17:55.158 --> 17:56.783
Fine, fine.
If that's the way
you want to play it,

17:56.868 --> 17:58.577
then you see,
I'm ringing the police.

17:58.661 --> 18:00.078
I'm dialing.

18:00.371 --> 18:01.663
Hello, police department,
please.

18:01.748 --> 18:03.248
I found your father
a new place to live.

18:03.332 --> 18:05.041
Yeah, I'd like to...

18:08.838 --> 18:09.921
What?

18:10.006 --> 18:12.883
The Regency.
Down by the wharf.

18:13.551 --> 18:15.218
Very tony address.

18:15.303 --> 18:18.555
Full-time care,
social activities,
medical staff.

18:19.015 --> 18:20.682
And the best part,

18:21.017 --> 18:24.227
they encourage
residents to garden
and grow their own food.

18:24.312 --> 18:26.521
Julius will be
a farmer again.

18:31.611 --> 18:35.197
His things are being moved
this very moment by the staff.

18:35.990 --> 18:37.824
They'll be set up
in his new room

18:37.909 --> 18:39.701
exactly how he had
them in the apartment.

18:39.786 --> 18:41.203
He loves it.

18:46.876 --> 18:48.001
Loves?

18:49.045 --> 18:51.671
Once I showed him
around the facility.

18:53.257 --> 18:55.467
Your father's a very
complicated man, Gaius,

18:55.551 --> 18:59.513
but there's
a few simple things
that make him very happy.

19:11.901 --> 19:13.860
The last time I saw him,

19:14.403 --> 19:16.071
he seemed happy.

19:20.243 --> 19:21.243
(DOOR CLOSES)

20:01.242 --> 20:02.617
Sorry, sir.

As I was saying,

20:05.371 --> 20:08.582
the old man intends
to fly the last Viper
off ship himself.

20:08.666 --> 20:10.959
Tell the deck gang
to leave one
launch tube intact,

20:11.043 --> 20:12.836
set to remote pilot launch.

20:12.920 --> 20:14.170
Yes, sir.

20:18.467 --> 20:21.011
You'll never make
admiral like that.

20:22.638 --> 20:24.764
TYROL: They're all
the same, Karl.

20:25.182 --> 20:27.183
No, they're different.

20:28.811 --> 20:30.145
You know they're different.

20:30.229 --> 20:33.231
How you felt about Boomer,
that was different.

20:33.941 --> 20:36.276
That's why you
did what you did.

20:36.652 --> 20:39.738
I did what I did because
I’m a frakking idiot.

20:40.197 --> 20:43.950
A 2,000-year-old idiot
who cannot learn
the simplest lesson.

20:44.076 --> 20:45.827
Machines are not people.

20:46.495 --> 20:48.288
They're just machines.

20:48.456 --> 20:51.166
My wife, Athena,

20:53.544 --> 20:56.171
She's a blow-up doll, Karl.
They all are.

20:56.881 --> 20:58.590
Athena, Sharon, Boomer.

20:58.674 --> 21:00.383
Call them what you will.
They're all the same.

21:00.468 --> 21:03.720
They're all the same,
because we made
them the same.

21:08.184 --> 21:11.227
Don't blame yourself,
but you can't trust them.

21:11.312 --> 21:13.438
You can't trust any of them.

21:35.044 --> 21:39.381
Dots. Lots and
lots and lots of dots.

21:40.591 --> 21:41.967
She's clearly very gifted.

21:42.051 --> 21:43.385
SIMON: She hasn't
eaten in days.

21:43.469 --> 21:45.887
I think we should
begin intravenous
nutritional supplements

21:45.972 --> 21:48.431
to build up her strength
before we begin testing.

21:48.516 --> 21:49.975
She wants her mother.

21:50.059 --> 21:52.978
Well, she can't have her
mother, now, can she?

21:53.062 --> 21:56.314
I'm sorry.
I forgot to sound
all soppy and soft

21:56.399 --> 21:57.983
when speaking of the child.

21:58.067 --> 21:59.943
She is a child,
a frightened one.

22:00.778 --> 22:03.738
She's a half-human,
half-machine
object of curiosity

22:03.823 --> 22:05.782
that holds the key
to our continued existence

22:05.866 --> 22:08.076
somewhere in
her genetic code.

22:08.744 --> 22:11.746

a tube in her
and get her ready.

We wanted to take
them with us, you know,

22:47.158 --> 22:48.825
so we wouldn't leave them
behind with the others.

22:48.951 --> 22:50.869
The others?
Lot of photos still
down there.

22:50.953 --> 22:53.121
Nobody knows who
they are anymore.

22:53.205 --> 22:56.708

and relatives of

along the way.

24:31.512 --> 24:33.012
Well, when will
you bear it in mind?

24:33.097 --> 24:35.014
You haven't even
listened to my proposal.

24:35.099 --> 24:37.475
I'm not even saying
it'll necessarily be me.

24:37.560 --> 24:40.019
My people deserve a
voice in the government.

24:40.104 --> 24:41.729
Now, I'm literally
talking about the lives

24:41.814 --> 24:44.357
and well-being of
thousands of people
in the fleet.

24:44.441 --> 24:45.441
Is that what you
were thinking about

24:45.526 --> 24:47.151
when you outted
Starbuck's secret?

24:47.236 --> 24:49.529
The well-being of
thousands of people?

24:49.613 --> 24:52.615
Or the political gain
of Gaius Baltar, again?

24:54.368 --> 24:56.452
Is that what this is about?

24:57.913 --> 24:59.789
Does everything
have to be reduced to

24:59.874 --> 25:02.750
your personal feelings
about Kara Thrace?

25:02.835 --> 25:04.794
Listen to me, Mr. Adama.

25:06.714 --> 25:07.755
Lee.

25:09.174 --> 25:12.051
I'm asking to have
a genuine conversation.

25:12.928 --> 25:14.095
Please.

25:20.728 --> 25:22.186
Five minutes.

25:24.607 --> 25:25.732
I'll be back
in five minutes.

25:25.816 --> 25:26.941
Five minutes inside.

25:27.359 --> 25:31.446
And you think there's
some kind of meaning
in these musical notes?

25:33.324 --> 25:35.825
I don't know.
I'm just groping, mostly,

25:35.910 --> 25:37.869
looking for patterns,
trying to see
what comes to me.

25:37.953 --> 25:41.289
I thought that
if I assigned numbers
to the notes...

25:43.792 --> 25:45.251
I don't know.

25:55.804 --> 25:59.807
What Baltar
said the other day,
is it the truth?

26:04.772 --> 26:05.855
Yeah.

and I burned it on Earth.

26:15.824 --> 26:17.742
I don't know what I am.

26:26.961 --> 26:28.419
I have to ask him a question.

26:28.504 --> 26:30.129
Do you know how
to plug him in?

26:32.716 --> 26:33.841
Yeah.

26:35.386 --> 26:36.469
Hey.

know the truth?

I don't really care
about the stats or the cup

27:44.371 --> 27:46.956
or the trophy,
or anything like that.

27:47.082 --> 27:50.668
In fact, even the
games aren't that
important to me, not really.

27:50.753 --> 27:56.466
What matters to me
is the perfect throw, okay?

27:56.550 --> 28:00.928
Making the perfect catch,
the perfect step and block,

28:02.473 --> 28:05.224
it's perfection.

the beauty of physics,
the wonder of mathematics.

You know, the elation

28:23.619 --> 28:26.704

28:26.789 --> 28:28.581

kind of perfection

be connected to.

into which we have poured

29:21.510 --> 29:23.678
all of our hopes and dreams,

when we can no longer
derive the security

29:28.559 --> 29:31.936
from looking out
a window and seeing her
massive bulk gliding by,

29:32.020 --> 29:34.188
then this life will be over

29:34.731 --> 29:37.024
and a new life
will have begun,

29:37.651 --> 29:40.987

a new way of thinking.

to do anything,

to make this new

is that my people

have a voice in

29:57.045 --> 29:58.796
I represent
thousands of people.

They deserve to
be enfranchised

just as much as anyone else.

30:02.467 --> 30:03.968

for me personally.

30:12.352 --> 30:14.896

the right thing to do.

30:17.900 --> 30:19.275
What I know

30:20.944 --> 30:23.738
is that in all the years
that I've known you,
I've never seen you make

30:23.822 --> 30:24.989
one truly selfless act.

30:25.073 --> 30:26.115
Right.

30:26.200 --> 30:27.950
Never seen you do something

30:28.035 --> 30:30.161
that didn't, on some level,
serve the greater needs

30:30.245 --> 30:31.412

take your hand.

or any representative

30:38.045 --> 30:39.795
from your movement
into the government.

30:39.880 --> 30:43.507
Right. So, that's
what it boils down to.

30:43.842 --> 30:46.385
My people can't
get representation

30:46.470 --> 30:48.971

haven't passed

even in the slightest.

33:02.397 --> 33:04.815
Can I have your
attention, please?

33:12.074 --> 33:13.240
I'm sure you're all aware

33:13.325 --> 33:16.535
that a child was abducted
from this ship recently.

33:16.745 --> 33:19.872
I thought that
a rescue mission
was impractical.

33:22.459 --> 33:24.001
Well, I was wrong.

33:24.086 --> 33:25.920
He didn't say where
he got the information,

33:26.046 --> 33:29.382
but Starbuck was there,
so I bet he talked to Anders.

33:29.508 --> 33:31.926
(PEOPLE MURMURING)
Yeah. I know.
Pretty freaky.

33:32.344 --> 33:33.761
He thought that
a rescue mission

33:33.845 --> 33:35.179
was impractical
because he didn't know

33:35.263 --> 33:38.349
where she was being held.
But that's changed now,
I guess,

33:38.433 --> 33:41.352
because he does know
where she's being held.

33:42.562 --> 33:44.980
Of course,
knowing where the colony is
is not nearly the same thing

33:45.065 --> 33:47.650
as being able to
actually get her out.

33:47.734 --> 33:50.194
This is insane.
You know that, right?

33:50.278 --> 33:51.987
What I know is that
Hera has some meaning

33:52.072 --> 33:53.739
that transcends
the here and now.

33:53.824 --> 33:56.367
She is meant to fulfill
a role, just as we were.

33:56.451 --> 33:58.744
So we're going,
the five of us.

33:59.204 --> 34:01.539
Oh, you're making decisions
for all of us now.

34:01.623 --> 34:02.623
You'll go, Tory.

34:02.707 --> 34:04.291
Truth is,
you never could be alone.

34:05.961 --> 34:09.255
Yeah, the mission
is to be strictly

34:09.506 --> 34:12.049
Any man or woman
over the age of 15.

34:12.634 --> 34:16.637
And the Admiral also wants
any former colonial
officer or crewman

34:16.721 --> 34:19.348
incarcerated after
the recent mutiny.

34:20.350 --> 34:22.226
Yeah. Yeah, that's it.

34:24.312 --> 34:26.480
Everyone has to
make their own choice,

34:26.565 --> 34:28.691
and they have to
do it in person.

34:28.859 --> 34:31.318
The old man is
waiting on the hangar deck.

yourselves in person.

you're gonna do?

34:44.166 --> 34:45.249
Not exactly.

34:45.333 --> 34:47.168
Well, take your time.

34:47.711 --> 34:51.005
It takes approximately
four minutes to
get down there.

34:52.132 --> 34:54.008
It's really happening.

34:55.093 --> 34:56.969
We're going after her.

34:57.679 --> 34:59.555
Or what's left of her.

35:00.348 --> 35:02.183
Cavil's probably had
her sliced and diced

35:02.267 --> 35:03.851
and cut up into
1,000 specimens...

35:03.935 --> 35:07.771
Stop it. Just stop it, okay?

35:07.939 --> 35:11.609
She's still alive,
and she's still out there,
and we're gonna get her,

35:11.693 --> 35:14.236
and everything's
gonna be all right.

35:14.321 --> 35:16.739
It's not gonna be
all right, Karl.

35:55.528 --> 35:56.987
I don't care.

This is a decision
I have made for myself.

If it turns out
that there are
not enough personnel

37:31.666 --> 37:33.334

is willing to join me.

37:49.184 --> 37:53.437

be a one-way trip.

of sentiment or emotion.

You're not
gonna believe this.

41:59.934 --> 42:01.518
STARBUCK: Based on the
coordinates we got from Sam,

42:01.603 --> 42:04.396
we have determined
that the Cylon
colony is located here.

42:04.480 --> 42:07.190
It's within our jump range,
but there's a sizable catch.

42:07.275 --> 42:10.527
It's located within
an accretion disk
of a naked singularity.

42:10.612 --> 42:12.529
It's a strategically-sound
position.

42:12.614 --> 42:15.699
The colony's bound
within the gravity well
of the black hole,

42:15.783 --> 42:17.367
but maintains a stable orbit.

42:17.452 --> 42:19.494
How do we get in there?
Look at all the crap

42:19.579 --> 42:20.704
floating around
in that current.

42:20.788 --> 42:22.456
STARBUCK: There is no way
to navigate that current.

42:22.540 --> 42:24.124
The tidal stresses
are too strong.

42:24.208 --> 42:26.418
It would rip the ship apart
before we got within 1 0 SU.

42:26.502 --> 42:27.961
But there is one
safe jump spot.

42:28.046 --> 42:29.379
It's where they
bring their baseships
in and out.

42:29.464 --> 42:31.673
We got lucky.
Two baseships
jumped in and out

42:31.758 --> 42:33.592
while the Raptor
was taking pictures.

42:33.676 --> 42:36.762
This right here is
our only parking spot.

42:36.846 --> 42:38.930
TIGH: That's right on top
of the frakking thing.

42:39.015 --> 42:40.766
APOLLO: Less than one click,
by our estimates.

42:40.850 --> 42:42.100
One click?

42:42.185 --> 42:43.393
Point-blank range.

42:43.478 --> 42:46.980
And you can bet
that they will have
every gun in that colony

42:47.065 --> 42:48.899
pointed at that
parking spot of yours.

42:48.983 --> 42:50.776
That's what I'd do.

42:50.860 --> 42:52.778
Leave only one
way in and out,

42:52.862 --> 42:55.864
then make it impossible
to get past the gates.

42:59.661 --> 43:00.994
All right.
