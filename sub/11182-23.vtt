01:09.800 --> 01:12.233
I can't wait to eat.
I'm starved.

01:12.300 --> 01:14.000
So am I.

01:14.067 --> 01:15.700
Luncheon is served.

01:17.833 --> 01:20.567
Oh, what is it, Alan?

01:20.633 --> 01:24.067
You're gonna love it.
I used to make this at the
commune in New Mexico.

01:24.133 --> 01:25.567
I call it "Desert Delight."

01:25.633 --> 01:27.767
"Desert Delight," huh?

01:27.833 --> 01:28.967
What are you doing, Florence?

01:29.033 --> 01:30.100
Checking for lizards.

01:34.500 --> 01:38.867
It's good for you.
It's vegetables mixed with
wheat germ, alfalfa sprouts,

01:38.933 --> 01:41.633
cactus milk and
powdered spleen.

01:41.700 --> 01:45.400
-Sounds delicious.
-Well, go ahead. What you
waiting for, Miss Jefferson?

01:47.633 --> 01:50.433
I thought I saw one of
my alfalfa sprouts move.

01:51.800 --> 01:54.767
Don't be silly.
Your mouth is gonna love it.

01:54.833 --> 01:56.200
Yeah, but my stomach
might hate it,

01:56.267 --> 01:58.300
and I don't want the two
of them arguing.

01:59.267 --> 02:01.433
Oh, where is your plate, Alan?

02:01.500 --> 02:03.933
Oh, I don't have time to
eat right now. I'll grab
a burger and fries later.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
(DOORBELL RINGS)

02:05.067 --> 02:07.533
I'll get it!
I'll get it.

02:07.600 --> 02:11.100
I'll get it. You two sit here
and enjoy your meal.

02:17.167 --> 02:18.633
Boy, that was good!

02:24.967 --> 02:29.233
-Oh, hi, Mom.
-Hi, honey. Oh, I hope
I'm not interrupting.

02:29.300 --> 02:32.900
-Oh, no, we're just
finishing lunch.
-Before it finishes us.

02:34.633 --> 02:35.933
Louise, guess what?

02:36.000 --> 02:37.700
The Help Center
chose its delegates

02:37.767 --> 02:40.167
to the National Convention
in Los Angeles.

02:40.233 --> 02:43.333
-Who did they pick?
-Two very
deserving individuals.

02:43.400 --> 02:45.667
It must be Evelyn and Joanne.

02:45.733 --> 02:50.800
No. They're an attractive,
charming, well-rounded
twosome.

02:50.867 --> 02:51.967
Dolly Parton.

02:54.133 --> 02:58.567
I'll give you a clue.
I'm looking at one and
you're looking at the other.

02:58.633 --> 03:00.467
You mean...
Uh-huh. You and me.

03:00.533 --> 03:01.700
Oh!

03:01.767 --> 03:02.867
Hey, congratulations!

03:02.933 --> 03:04.833
Oh, we won! We won!

03:04.900 --> 03:07.533
Now calm down, Louise.
We're just representing
the Help Center.

03:07.600 --> 03:08.733
We didn't win anything.

03:08.800 --> 03:10.267
Oh, well, that's true.

03:10.333 --> 03:11.767
We won, girl! We won!

03:11.833 --> 03:13.900
Yeah, we won!
We won! We won!

03:15.533 --> 03:17.267
What is all
the shouting about?

03:17.333 --> 03:19.133
Guess where Mom and
Mrs. Jefferson are going.

03:19.200 --> 03:22.567
They keep acting like that,
they're going to
the funny farm.

03:22.633 --> 03:26.433
-We're going to
sunny California.
-California?

03:26.500 --> 03:32.933
* California, here I come
Right back where
I started from

03:33.000 --> 03:36.700
* Where barrels of flowers
bloom in the spring.
Da, da, da, da... *

03:36.767 --> 03:39.700
Hey, would you get
Billy Dee Williams' autograph
for me?

03:39.767 --> 03:42.267
Florence, we're gonna be
out there talking business.

03:42.333 --> 03:43.500
I'm talking business, too.

03:45.300 --> 03:47.800
I'll give you 5 bucks
for his autograph.

03:47.867 --> 03:49.233
When are you leaving?

03:49.300 --> 03:52.600
Two weeks from Saturday
for one glorious week
of sun and fun.

03:52.667 --> 03:57.367
Oh, I can't wait.
Uh-oh. Two weeks
from Saturday?

03:57.433 --> 04:00.767
-What's the matter?
-That means we would
be gone on the 30th.

04:00.833 --> 04:04.367
-So?
-That's my 28th
wedding anniversary.

04:04.433 --> 04:06.200
Oh, that is bad news.

04:06.267 --> 04:09.200
It sure is. Twenty-eight years
with Mr. Jefferson
ain't a marriage.

04:10.967 --> 04:12.367
It's a life sentence.

04:14.400 --> 04:16.733
The date really isn't
important, Mrs. Jefferson.

04:16.800 --> 04:20.067
You can express your love
for each other
any day you want.

04:20.133 --> 04:22.233
I know, but...

04:22.300 --> 04:25.867
Louise, it's more than
your anniversary that's
bothering you, isn't it?

04:25.933 --> 04:29.800
Well, it's for a whole week,
and George hates it if
I'm not here.

04:29.867 --> 04:33.900
Oh, well, Louise, you've been
away from George before.
Haven't you?

04:35.367 --> 04:36.367
Never?

04:38.900 --> 04:39.900
Damn.

04:44.667 --> 04:47.567
Now that is bad news.

04:47.633 --> 04:53.000
-Well, George likes someone
here when he gets home.
-Why? He only ignores you.

04:53.067 --> 04:55.567
Well, George likes someone
here to ignore.

04:55.633 --> 04:57.433
Hey, Florence and I
will be here.

04:57.500 --> 04:59.300
Yeah. He can ignore us.

04:59.367 --> 05:02.600
And he likes someone here
in case he wants a sandwich.

05:02.667 --> 05:04.733
Shoot, I can
take care of that.

05:04.800 --> 05:08.000
And he likes his mail
open and sorted before
he gets home.

05:08.067 --> 05:09.667
I can take care of that.

05:09.733 --> 05:11.900
And he hates sleeping
by himself.

05:11.967 --> 05:13.033
You can take care of that.

05:19.100 --> 05:23.267
Why don't you just explain
to him how important
this is to you?

05:23.333 --> 05:24.667
He'll understand.

05:26.600 --> 05:29.267
You're right. I'm an idiot.

05:29.333 --> 05:31.867
Well, good luck, girl.
I'm going up to tell Tom
the news.

05:31.933 --> 05:34.167
Hey, wait up, Mom,
I'll walk you out.

05:34.233 --> 05:37.233
Too bad George isn't more
like your father. Then we
wouldn't have this problem.

05:37.300 --> 05:40.133
Yeah. But then think of
the problem
Mr. Jefferson would have.

05:40.200 --> 05:42.100
-What's that?
-He'd be white.
-Oh...

05:45.967 --> 05:48.967
Come on, Howard.
I wouldn't try
to take advantage of you.

05:49.033 --> 05:52.333
I've been doing business with
your uncle's restaurant
too long for that.

05:52.400 --> 05:53.600
Look, Mr. Jefferson, I...

05:53.667 --> 05:54.867
Call me George.

05:54.933 --> 05:57.967
Oh, George...
Oh, you can call me Howie.

06:00.433 --> 06:02.467
All right, Howie.

06:02.533 --> 06:06.267
The Restaurant Owners
Association meetings
are closed to outsiders.

06:06.333 --> 06:09.733
Outsider? I'm no outsider.
I've been eating
in restaurants for years.

06:14.833 --> 06:19.200
Oh... Well, tell me, George,
why do you wanna get into
this meeting, hmm?

06:19.267 --> 06:21.000
Oh, well, uh...

06:21.067 --> 06:23.700
Well, uh, see, um,
my wife and I are always
looking for new places to eat.

06:23.767 --> 06:26.500
-Oh, and who knows better than
restaurant owners, right?
-Right.

06:26.567 --> 06:30.333
Oh, come on, George, you can't
fool me. You just wanna meet
those restaurant owners

06:30.400 --> 06:34.300
so you can hustle
some new business for
your dry cleaning operation.

06:34.367 --> 06:37.033
I knew I couldn't fool you,
Howie. You're too sharp!

06:39.633 --> 06:43.200
That's why Uncle Martin
made me sales manager of
his entire restaurant chain.

06:43.267 --> 06:45.133
He told me I had
good business sense.

06:45.200 --> 06:49.067
-You do. You do. He made
a damn good choice.
-Thank you.

06:49.133 --> 06:52.067
But, what would Uncle
Martin say if you were
to come back

06:52.133 --> 06:55.933
with a brand new cleaning
contract that saved him 5%?

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
-5%?
-Did I say 5%?
I meant 10.

06:59.067 --> 07:00.867
Wow! 10%!

07:00.933 --> 07:04.367
Yep. That's right. And
all you have to do is get
me into that meeting.

07:04.433 --> 07:08.067
Well, gee, for 10%,
Uncle Martin might make me
a vice president.

07:08.133 --> 07:09.900
No telling how far
you could go.

07:09.967 --> 07:12.833
Why, I might make
senior vice president for 20%.

07:12.900 --> 07:13.900
Right, right.

07:14.533 --> 07:15.667
20%?

07:15.733 --> 07:18.967
20% You got a deal.

07:19.033 --> 07:22.300
Oh boy, I can't wait to tell
Uncle Martin the good news.
He'll be so proud of me.

07:22.367 --> 07:25.067
Well, look, just make sure
you get me into that meeting.

07:25.133 --> 07:27.467
Okay. You drive
a hard bargain, George.

07:27.533 --> 07:30.100
I, I shouldn't have let you
take such advantage of me.

07:30.167 --> 07:32.900
-Well, I hope you learned
something about business.
-Huh?

07:32.967 --> 07:35.533
Be careful when you're
dealing with an old pro.

07:35.600 --> 07:37.400
I would have given you 25%

07:37.467 --> 07:38.867
I would have settled for 15.

07:43.267 --> 07:44.400
Jeanie!

07:44.467 --> 07:46.367
Yes, sir?

07:46.433 --> 07:48.100
Look, put on my calendar
I got a meeting with
Howard Benson

07:48.167 --> 07:50.467
at the Bedford Arms, last
Tuesday of this month.

07:50.533 --> 07:53.833
Okay. Oh, you're already
booked for that night.

07:53.900 --> 07:55.867
Cancel it!
This is more important.

07:55.933 --> 08:00.500
Okay. I'll call your wife and
tell her you're unable to
make it for your anniversary.

08:00.567 --> 08:03.667
Hold it! That ain't
my anniversary! Is it?

08:03.733 --> 08:05.100
I'm afraid so.

08:05.167 --> 08:08.733
-Oh, damn, I missed
the last two.
-Three.

08:08.800 --> 08:11.733
Whatever. If I miss
another anniversary
I'll never see another one.

08:11.800 --> 08:14.233
Well, you still want me
to call your wife and
tell her you can't make it?

08:14.300 --> 08:18.967
No. Put Benson's name
on my calendar.
And order me a dozen roses.

08:19.033 --> 08:22.500
Now, Mr. Jefferson,
do you really think you can
bribe Mrs. Jefferson

08:22.567 --> 08:24.533
with a dozen roses?

08:24.600 --> 08:26.900
Yeah, maybe you're right.
Make it two dozen.

08:34.933 --> 08:37.067
Oh, Florence,
how's my dinner coming?

08:37.133 --> 08:39.433
Fine. You did a great job
on them ribs.

08:39.500 --> 08:41.767
But you know it ain't
gonna make no difference,
don't you?

08:41.833 --> 08:46.000
Well, Mr. Jefferson may
surprise you. He can be a very
understanding husband.

08:46.067 --> 08:48.667
Are you sure we're
talking about the same
Mr. Jefferson?

08:48.733 --> 08:51.433
I just have to use the
right approach.

08:51.500 --> 08:53.800
Well, be careful. You can
get arrested for
husband beating.

08:53.867 --> 08:57.567
Oh... Florence...

09:03.633 --> 09:08.733
George, I'm representing
the Help Center at the
convention in Los Angeles.

09:08.800 --> 09:11.867
It's important that I go,
and you'll just have
to live with that.

09:12.933 --> 09:14.967
No, that won't work.

09:18.900 --> 09:24.667
Georgie... Guess what?

09:24.733 --> 09:28.633
Your little Weezy-pooh
has been asked to go
to Los Angeles.

09:28.700 --> 09:31.200
And I'll be gone all week.

09:31.267 --> 09:33.400
What do you say, Georgie-pooh?

09:33.467 --> 09:35.233
Fat chance, Weezy-pooh.

09:38.333 --> 09:40.867
If I were you, I would
just call him from California.

09:40.933 --> 09:43.233
Tell him you're on
a cross-town bus
and it got hijacked.

09:45.633 --> 09:48.833
He'd never believe that.
Would he?

09:48.900 --> 09:52.867
Oh, I don't know what to do.
How will I ever tell George?

09:52.933 --> 09:56.567
-Tell me what?
-Oh, oh...
George, you're home.

09:56.633 --> 09:58.633
Yeah, I know that.
Tell me what?

09:58.700 --> 10:04.100
-Uh... Tell you how much
I missed you today.
-Oh. I missed you, too, Weez.

10:04.167 --> 10:06.600
Not as much as I missed you.

10:06.667 --> 10:10.533
Look, I missed you more
than you missed me. Here.

10:10.600 --> 10:12.633
What are these?

10:12.700 --> 10:17.933
Flowers. Roses. For the
one person who makes this
house worth coming home to.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.767
Oh, thank you, Mr. Jefferson.

10:23.567 --> 10:24.567
Not you.

10:25.667 --> 10:30.000
-Weez...
-Oh, thank you, George.
But why?

10:30.067 --> 10:32.667
Well, just because
you're a great wife.

10:32.733 --> 10:35.167
Here, Florence,
make yourself useful.
Put these in some water.

10:35.233 --> 10:37.700
Mmm, George,
they smell wonderful!

10:37.767 --> 10:38.967
They smell fishy to me.

10:41.733 --> 10:44.000
Speaking of smelling,
what's that cooking?

10:44.067 --> 10:47.133
Your favorite. Ribs.
I cooked them myself.

10:47.200 --> 10:49.900
Mmm. I knew Florence didn't
cook them 'cause the house
ain't full of smoke.

10:52.400 --> 10:57.533
George, you look tired.
Why don't you relax and
I'll make you a drink.

10:57.600 --> 11:01.733
Oh, no, you sit down. You've
been cooking all afternoon.
I'll make you a drink.

11:02.900 --> 11:05.800
Oh, George!
You are so considerate.

11:05.867 --> 11:10.667
Me? No, you're the one
who's so thoughtful.
Cooking me ribs and all.

11:10.733 --> 11:15.567
Oh, well, my day wasn't
nearly as hard as yours.

11:15.633 --> 11:19.667
My day wasn't that hard.
Just the usual dirty clothes.

11:19.733 --> 11:21.800
Weezy, you really look
beautiful tonight.

11:21.867 --> 11:27.900
Oh, George, you are always so
affectionate and open-minded,
and unselfish.

11:27.967 --> 11:30.800
Well, that's because
you're so understanding,
fair and loving.

11:32.667 --> 11:34.733
I thought you all was
having ribs, not bull.

11:42.167 --> 11:43.567
Thank you, sweetheart.

11:43.633 --> 11:45.000
Thank you, precious.

11:48.400 --> 11:52.867
You know, George,
our anniversary is coming up
in a couple of weeks.

11:52.933 --> 11:54.333
Yeah, I know. What about it?

11:54.400 --> 11:57.967
Well, the funniest thing
happened today.

11:58.033 --> 12:02.233
The Help Center chose
Helen and me as delegates
to their convention.

12:02.300 --> 12:04.067
Oh, that's great.

12:04.133 --> 12:07.267
But it's in Los Angeles,
and I have to be there
the week of our anniversary.

12:07.333 --> 12:08.633
The week of our anniversary?

12:08.700 --> 12:10.800
Now, George, I know you
don't like to be here alone...

12:10.867 --> 12:13.367
-You mean you'll be gone
on Tuesday the 30th?
-Uh, yes. But...

12:13.433 --> 12:14.433
Hey, that's great!

12:17.633 --> 12:19.167
That's fantastic.

12:19.233 --> 12:20.733
You don't mind if I go?

12:20.800 --> 12:23.867
Of course I don't mind.
How could you pass up an
opportunity like that?

12:23.933 --> 12:26.633
Uh, I can't help it.
I gotta try me one of
them ribs here.

12:28.167 --> 12:30.333
George!

12:30.400 --> 12:34.233
-You're sure you don't mind?
-Of course not, Weezy.
Have a good time.

12:37.167 --> 12:38.933
I heard it, but I still
don't believe it.

12:40.967 --> 12:42.700
Why not?

12:42.767 --> 12:48.600
Deep down inside,
George is really a warm,
sincere, open-minded husband,

12:48.667 --> 12:53.167
and... Who am I kidding?
What is that
turkey trying to pull?

13:02.233 --> 13:07.000
-What is that joker up to?
-I don't know, but he sure
was acting strange.

13:07.067 --> 13:09.667
I mean, like he had
something on his mind.

13:09.733 --> 13:11.200
Or somebody.

13:11.267 --> 13:15.233
-Why that sneaky little...
-Oh, Mr. Jefferson
wouldn't cheat on you.

13:15.300 --> 13:18.133
You're right. But he's
still little and sneaky.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.400
And he's up to something,
and I'm gonna get
to the bottom of it!

13:24.467 --> 13:26.167
Well, with him,
you ain't gotta go too far.

13:29.567 --> 13:31.933
George, what do you think
you're doing?

13:32.000 --> 13:35.133
Oh, just eating a rib.
They were delicious, Weez.
What's your secret?

13:35.200 --> 13:37.233
Secret? That's my recipe.

13:37.300 --> 13:39.533
Well, how come your ribs
always taste like dog food?

13:41.867 --> 13:44.300
You always seem
to woof 'em down, Fido.

13:51.000 --> 13:55.500
George, did you hear me
when I said the convention
is being held in Los Angeles?

13:55.567 --> 13:58.267
That's California.
Way out west.

13:58.333 --> 14:01.967
-Sure I heard you.
-Between Tijuana
and Las Vegas.

14:02.033 --> 14:05.700
Florence, I know where it is.
It's that way.
And the kitchen is that way,

14:05.767 --> 14:06.833
where you should be!

14:06.900 --> 14:10.433
Now he sounds more
like himself.

14:10.500 --> 14:13.900
George, you'll be here
without me
on our anniversary.

14:13.967 --> 14:18.500
Damn, I know, Weez!
But look, this convention is
a one-shot deal.

14:18.567 --> 14:20.367
I mean, we'll have
a lot more anniversaries.

14:20.433 --> 14:23.933
-Well, that's true. But...
-Anyway, the Help Center's
depending on you.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
-Well, that's true...
-I mean, you can't let
them down.

14:26.067 --> 14:29.933
You got to be there.
In fact, I insist that you go.

14:30.000 --> 14:36.367
-You insist I go?
Okay, buster, out with it.
-Out with what?

14:36.433 --> 14:38.933
Why aren't you mad about
me going to California?

14:39.000 --> 14:40.233
You want me to be mad?

14:40.300 --> 14:42.533
If you loved me you'd be mad.

14:42.600 --> 14:43.633
Okay, I'm mad.

14:43.700 --> 14:44.933
You are not mad.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.233
Yes, I am mad.

14:46.300 --> 14:47.600
No, you're not!

14:47.667 --> 14:50.100
I'm mad! I'm mad! I'm mad!
I'm mad! I'm mad!

14:51.367 --> 14:52.367
Okay?

14:55.433 --> 14:57.133
Now go to California
and have a good time.

14:59.200 --> 15:01.800
There has to be another reason
you want me to go.

15:03.700 --> 15:06.200
Oh, yeah, there is
another reason. A big reason.

15:06.267 --> 15:08.133
Okay, let's have it.

15:08.733 --> 15:09.733
Well...

15:12.067 --> 15:15.733
I want you to go because...

15:17.167 --> 15:18.567
Because I'm proud of you.

15:22.033 --> 15:23.800
You are proud of me?

15:23.867 --> 15:25.800
Yeah. I'm proud that
you got chosen to go
to the convention.

15:26.700 --> 15:29.067
It's a real honor.

15:29.133 --> 15:33.733
-Well, yes,
I guess it is an honor.
-Sure it is. It's a big honor!

15:34.733 --> 15:37.067
Oh, George, I feel terrible.

15:37.133 --> 15:40.000
You were
just being considerate
and I didn't trust you.

15:40.067 --> 15:41.633
(DOORBELL RINGS)

15:41.700 --> 15:43.133
I'm sorry.

15:44.600 --> 15:46.867
It's okay, Weezy.
We all make mistakes.

15:49.100 --> 15:50.800
Oh, hi, Helen.

15:50.867 --> 15:54.467
Uh, Louise, about our trip
to Los Angeles,
we're both in the same boat.

15:54.533 --> 15:56.367
Boat? I thought you were
going by plane?

15:57.567 --> 15:59.033
Oh, what's the problem, Helen?

15:59.100 --> 16:01.367
Tom doesn't want me to go
to Los Angeles.

16:01.433 --> 16:03.900
What?
That doesn't sound like Tom.

16:03.967 --> 16:05.233
Yes, it does.

16:05.300 --> 16:06.467
Sounds just like a honky.

16:08.633 --> 16:12.133
Once the master gets you on
the plantation, you got
to stay there for good!

16:16.767 --> 16:18.500
Did you pick any cotton
this morning?

16:24.167 --> 16:28.533
I wish I had, so I could
stuff it in your mouth.

16:28.600 --> 16:31.933
Tom made plans for us to
go skiing the same week
as the convention.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.667
Oh, Helen, what are you
gonna do?

16:34.733 --> 16:36.233
Me? Don't you mean "we"?

16:36.300 --> 16:39.067
No, she means you.
Weezy's going to Los Angeles.

16:39.133 --> 16:41.400
Did I hear right? You mean,
he doesn't mind if you go?

16:41.467 --> 16:43.133
That's right.
Of course I don't mind.

16:43.200 --> 16:45.467
And if you don't mind,
Weezy's got a lot of
packing to do.

16:45.533 --> 16:48.000
George, I haven't finished
talking with Helen.

16:48.067 --> 16:50.933
That's all right, call her
from California. Collect.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.633
I'm not sure I wanna go
without Helen.

16:52.700 --> 16:54.000
What?

16:54.067 --> 16:55.667
Oh, Louise, I couldn't
let you do that.

16:55.733 --> 16:56.967
That's right.
Don't let her do that.

16:58.433 --> 17:00.733
It wouldn't be any fun
without you.

17:00.800 --> 17:01.967
Weezy, are you crazy?

17:02.033 --> 17:03.233
Helen ain't no fun.

17:05.467 --> 17:08.833
I better call the Center
and tell them to pick
two alternates.

17:08.900 --> 17:10.867
Recommend Janis Bradley.

17:10.933 --> 17:12.267
She's a lawyer.

17:12.333 --> 17:15.367
Good idea.
A lawyer would be perfect.

17:15.433 --> 17:18.467
Hey, hold it, Weezy. Look,
I ain't gonna let you blow
this trip because of Willis.

17:18.533 --> 17:20.533
Oh, but, George...
Just leave everything to me.

17:20.600 --> 17:23.667
Oh, that Tom... Sometimes
he's as stubborn as a mule.

17:23.733 --> 17:24.767
Where you going, George?

17:24.833 --> 17:26.300
Up to talk to her jackass.

Ahh!

Don't shoot,
just take the wallet.

George, George, it's only me.

Willis...

Who the hell are you
supposed to be,
The Incredible Honky?

18:15.633 --> 18:18.333
George, this is
my new skiing outfit.

18:18.400 --> 18:20.200
Skiing? What a
dumb thing to do.

18:20.267 --> 18:21.600
Why?

18:21.667 --> 18:24.100
Well, because
if you fell in the snow,
they'd never find you.

18:27.100 --> 18:30.400
Say, George, your feet are
about the same size
as Helen's.

18:30.467 --> 18:32.967
Er, could you step
into her boots?

18:33.033 --> 18:36.000
-What? Willis, are you crazy?
-Oh, come on. I have to
adjust the bindings.

18:36.067 --> 18:39.600
Look, I came up here to
talk about Helen going to
California with Weezy.

18:39.667 --> 18:41.833
Oh, yes, do you believe
those two?

18:41.900 --> 18:45.267
Wanting to fly off
to Los Angeles
for an entire week.

18:45.333 --> 18:47.700
Uh-huh. Now I get it.

18:47.767 --> 18:49.400
It ain't the skiing trip
you're worried about,

18:49.467 --> 18:50.767
it's Helen being gone
for a week.

18:51.500 --> 18:52.533
Well, uh...

18:52.600 --> 18:53.933
I'm surprised at you, Willis.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.933
Don't you know how much
this trip means to me?
I mean, Helen?

18:56.900 --> 18:57.900
The other foot.

18:58.400 --> 18:59.667
Shoot.

18:59.733 --> 19:00.933
Why are you so concerned
about Helen?

19:01.000 --> 19:02.467
'Cause I like Helen!

19:02.533 --> 19:04.467
I want her to have
a good marriage.

19:04.533 --> 19:05.967
And she ain't gonna have
no good marriage

19:06.033 --> 19:07.500
if you don't trust her
to go away for one week.

19:07.567 --> 19:11.300
Look, George, our marriage
is based entirely on fidelity.

19:11.367 --> 19:12.833
What's a record player
gotta do with it?

19:17.067 --> 19:20.333
I am talking about an
honest relationship.
One that's built on trust.

19:20.400 --> 19:22.500
Yeah, you trust her to do
whatever you tell her to.

19:24.967 --> 19:26.833
Don't be ridiculous!

19:26.900 --> 19:29.967
Helen's her own person.
She's always been free to
do what she wants.

19:30.033 --> 19:31.833
Good. Then I'll tell her
she can go to California.

19:31.900 --> 19:35.100
Oh, well, now, wait a minute.
That's, uh, that's different.

-Uh-huh. I don't wanna
argue with you, Willis.
-Good.

19:37.933 --> 19:40.267
I just hope you get used
to living here all alone.

19:41.267 --> 19:42.833
What do you mean by that?

19:42.900 --> 19:45.167
Well, Helen was pretty upset.

19:45.233 --> 19:47.400
You know it always starts
with the little things.

19:47.467 --> 19:49.133
What always starts with
the little things?

19:49.800 --> 19:52.000
Divorce.

19:52.067 --> 19:54.233
Divorce? Oh, come on.

19:55.200 --> 19:57.400
Was she that upset?

19:57.467 --> 20:01.100
Well, all I know I heard
her talking to Weezy about
calling in a good lawyer.

20:01.167 --> 20:03.000
A lawyer?

20:03.067 --> 20:08.267
Well, maybe I was
a bit selfish. I mean, what's
a little trip to L.A. anyway?

20:08.333 --> 20:09.333
Right.
Come on, George!

20:09.400 --> 20:10.500

Hey!

(TELEPHONE RINGS)

20:22.567 --> 20:25.033
Yes, it took me back
a little, too.

Darn near knocked me over.

right now.

Sure. Right.

has been postponed

20:41.833 --> 20:45.267
from Tuesday, the 30th

20:45.333 --> 20:48.067
to Monday the 5th.

20:50.400 --> 20:52.200
And you can still
get George in?

20:53.600 --> 20:56.433
Yes, I'll make sure
he gets it.

20:58.433 --> 21:00.167
Boy, is he gonna get it.

21:02.333 --> 21:04.367
Girl, what's wrong?

21:04.433 --> 21:07.433
George wanted me out of town
because he made
a business appointment

21:07.500 --> 21:10.433
on our anniversary.

21:10.500 --> 21:13.633
Well, give your wife the
good news, Willis. Tell her
she can go to Los Angeles.

21:13.700 --> 21:16.500
That's right, Helen.
We can go skiing another time.

21:16.567 --> 21:19.300
George convinced me
how selfish I was being.

21:19.367 --> 21:22.567
Oh, he did, did he?

21:22.633 --> 21:23.833
Well, it's the least
I could do.

21:24.700 --> 21:26.500
You know, George,

21:26.567 --> 21:29.933
sometimes I forget that I
have such a loving and
honest husband.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.600
Oh, come on, Weezy,
Tom and Helen know
what a great guy I am.

21:32.667 --> 21:33.667
So do I.

21:36.267 --> 21:40.400
But sometimes we all forget
what kind of guy
you really are.

21:40.467 --> 21:41.500
I don't.

21:43.033 --> 21:44.767
So while you were upstairs,

21:44.833 --> 21:49.100
I decided that I should
call the Center and cancel
my trip to California

21:49.167 --> 21:51.967
so we could celebrate
our anniversary.

21:52.033 --> 21:53.567
Hey, Weezy,
I can't let you do that.

21:53.633 --> 21:56.033
We can celebrate
our anniversary any time.

21:56.100 --> 21:57.467
Well, that's true.

21:57.533 --> 21:59.633
Sure. So look,
you go to California,

21:59.700 --> 22:02.067
and when you come back
we can celebrate
the anniversary.

22:02.133 --> 22:05.200
I'll be back on Monday
the 5th. Can we do it then?

22:05.267 --> 22:07.433
Monday the 5th?
That's great. Perfect.

22:07.500 --> 22:11.567
Well, I guess I could go.
But I want us both
to agree on that day

22:11.633 --> 22:13.767
I agree. You agree.

22:13.833 --> 22:16.900
And you promise that
we'll spend the entire
day together?

22:16.967 --> 22:18.800
I promise, I promise.

22:18.867 --> 22:20.800
If I was you
I'd get that in writing.

22:22.667 --> 22:26.367
Oh, no, I trust him, Florence.
But it's such a shame.

22:26.433 --> 22:28.967
Now he won't be able
to make that
restaurant meeting.

22:29.033 --> 22:31.567
Sure, I will.
That's on the 30th.

22:31.633 --> 22:34.067
Hey, how'd you know
about that?

22:34.133 --> 22:36.367
Mr. Benson called
while you were upstairs.

22:36.433 --> 22:39.867
-The meeting's been postponed
until Monday the 5th.
-What?

22:39.933 --> 22:42.333
But you won't be there,
will you?

22:42.400 --> 22:46.233
Because we'll be celebrating
our anniversary.

22:46.300 --> 22:48.867
George, how could you?
Telling Tom he was selfish,

22:48.933 --> 22:51.933
when all along
you were using him and Louise.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.800
Oh, what a tangled web
we weave.

22:56.767 --> 22:59.067
Look, why don't you two weave
your way out of here.

22:59.800 --> 23:01.033
Gladly. Let's go, Tom.

23:01.100 --> 23:02.567
(MOCKINGLY)
Gladly. Let's go, Tom.

23:05.167 --> 23:06.900
Can't you find nothing
better to do?

23:06.967 --> 23:09.067
I ain't leaving. This is
better than a hockey game.

23:10.367 --> 23:12.267
Okay, good.

23:12.333 --> 23:15.667
Pretend you're the puck,
the kitchen is the goal, and
I'm about to make a slap shot.

23:15.733 --> 23:18.200
Okay, Shorty.
But you're skating
on thin ice.

23:23.267 --> 23:25.667
How could you say all
those things?

23:25.733 --> 23:27.433
Telling me how proud you were.

23:27.500 --> 23:30.233
Weezy, I was telling you
the truth. I am proud of you.

23:30.300 --> 23:33.300
Good. I'll remember that
when I'm at the convention.

23:33.367 --> 23:36.967
Oh, Louise, I can't stay
here all by myself. I ain't
gonna have nothing to do.

23:37.033 --> 23:38.933
Oh, yes, you will, George.

23:39.000 --> 23:42.867
You'll have a whole week
to plan our anniversary.

23:45.767 --> 23:48.533
Hey, you ever been to a
restaurant meeting?

23:48.600 --> 23:49.700
No, George.

23:50.600 --> 23:51.833
Swell bunch of guys.

23:51.900 --> 23:53.067
No, George.

23:53.133 --> 23:54.800
Oh, Weezy, and the food,
you wouldn't believe!

23:54.867 --> 23:55.900
No, George.

23:55.967 --> 23:57.033
You'd love Howie.

23:57.100 --> 23:58.300
No, George!

24:34.300 --> 24:38.300
LOUISE: The Jeffersons was
videotaped in front of
a studio audience.

24:39.300 --> 24:41.767
* Movin', movin' on up
