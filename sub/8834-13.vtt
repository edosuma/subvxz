Next time I decide

01:16.583 --> 01:20.291
Hiya, shrimp.
Maybe you didn't know it,

01:20.375 --> 01:24.000
but there's a toll
for passing through our territory.

01:27.542 --> 01:30.000
And it's payday.

01:30.083 --> 01:33.792
Oh, yeah?
Well, come and get it, big mouth!

01:35.291 --> 01:37.125
[Baloo]
Listen, little britches,

01:37.208 --> 01:39.917
what I want to know is why you decided

01:40.000 --> 01:43.208
to take on
those street pirates by yourself.

01:43.291 --> 01:45.500
I thought you were smarter than that.

01:45.583 --> 01:50.041
Those nose wipes robbed me!
They grabbed my air foil!

01:50.125 --> 01:53.959
And when they couldn't figure out
what it was, they wrecked it!

01:54.041 --> 01:57.583
Well, now, it'll never play
the violin again,

01:57.667 --> 02:00.250
but I think Wildcat can fix it up for you.

02:00.333 --> 02:05.083
That's not the point! It was mine!
And they had no right to take it!

02:05.166 --> 02:08.083
When the bad guys
start using their muscles,

02:08.166 --> 02:10.875
you got to start using your head.

02:10.959 --> 02:13.792
Now, pretend I'm six guys.

02:13.875 --> 02:16.125
Hey, kid, nice hat!

02:16.583 --> 02:18.583
Now, what are you gonna do about it?

02:18.667 --> 02:20.458
[grunting]

02:21.959 --> 02:26.166
Tsk, tsk, tsk. Pathetic.
You're not listening, son.

02:26.250 --> 02:29.834
When you're outmuscled,
you got to out-think them.

02:30.458 --> 02:36.458
Smart, subtle, and trickier
than a bathtub full of Jell-O.

02:36.542 --> 02:38.542
-Got it?
-I think so.

02:38.917 --> 02:41.875
So, you think you can
do something about this?

02:41.959 --> 02:46.125
Why, no. But I'll bet that policeman can.

02:46.208 --> 02:48.625
Uh, what cop?
Hey!

02:48.709 --> 02:49.834
[grunts]

02:51.750 --> 02:54.583
By George, I think he's got it!

02:54.667 --> 02:58.709
What do you say you and me
go teach those street goons a lesson?

02:58.792 --> 03:01.041
We can't waste time with those nobodies.

03:01.125 --> 03:04.208
There are more important things
on our agenda.

03:04.291 --> 03:05.583
Yeah? Like...

03:07.000 --> 03:09.250
Shh... treasure.

03:09.500 --> 03:12.500
A lost idol worth millions.

03:12.583 --> 03:16.667
Again? Rebecca will never
go for it, Baloo.

03:16.750 --> 03:22.000
Now you leave Becky to me.
I've got the perfect story.

03:23.375 --> 03:27.291
Uh, so, you see, Rebecca,
this sick aunt of mine

03:27.375 --> 03:32.333
-really needs my help, and I thought--
-What was this aunt's name again, Baloo?

03:32.417 --> 03:34.333
Uh... uh, Milly.

03:34.417 --> 03:37.291
Yeah, that's it. Aunt Milly.

03:37.375 --> 03:43.083
Milly? That makes 23 sick aunts
in the last six months.

03:43.166 --> 03:48.250
Uh, well, you see, Pop's side
of the family was never very healthy.

03:48.333 --> 03:50.959
It's another treasure hunt, isn't it?

03:51.041 --> 03:55.583
Well, you've earned some time off.
So, go get it out of your system.

03:55.667 --> 03:59.041
But be ready for a great big,
"I told you so," when you come back.

03:59.125 --> 04:03.125
The only reason I'll be coming back
is for the <i>Sea Duck's </i> pink slip.

04:03.250 --> 04:05.250
Have a nice treasure hunt.

04:06.041 --> 04:08.083
Don't hurt yourself
carrying all that loot!

04:08.166 --> 04:09.750
[laughs]

04:14.792 --> 04:17.666
[Kit]
All right! A treasure hunt!

04:19.000 --> 04:24.125
You know, people have been looking for
this lost idol for years and years.

04:24.208 --> 04:27.291
The only reason that doohickey
it's still on the loose

04:27.375 --> 04:31.375
is because old Papa Bear's
never tried his luck.

04:31.625 --> 04:37.250
But since the Sultan of Kafusalum
has offered a 13 million torbit reward,

04:37.333 --> 04:41.250
that little baby isn't going to be
lonesome much longer.

04:41.834 --> 04:44.208
Thirteen million torbits?

04:44.291 --> 04:47.917
Every treasure hunter in the world's
gonna be after that.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.583
Come on, Kit, boy.

04:49.667 --> 04:54.333
How many treasure hunters
of old Baloo's caliber can there be?

04:54.667 --> 04:56.458
[all chattering]

04:58.959 --> 05:02.500
I give up, Baloo.
How many can there be?

05:02.583 --> 05:06.750
Hey, little boy Baloo!
What do you hear? What do you say, man?

05:06.834 --> 05:11.083
Louie, old buddy, hey,
what are all these yahoos doing here?

05:11.166 --> 05:13.208
Oh, same thing you are.

05:13.291 --> 05:17.458
I made my place
official idol huntin' headquarters.

05:17.542 --> 05:20.625
Hey, all right, innkeeper!

05:20.709 --> 05:23.959
You got any fresh info
for us fortune hunters?

05:24.041 --> 05:26.458
Well, nothing that's not as old
as the legend.

05:26.959 --> 05:32.792
The idol is in the land of 1,001 lakes
right under your nose.

05:33.166 --> 05:37.166
"Right under your nose."
What's that supposed to mean?

05:38.750 --> 05:40.500
-Thembrians!
-Oh...

05:40.583 --> 05:43.250
I wonder what His Shortness is doing here.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.667
[grunting]

05:59.166 --> 06:03.333
I am Colonel Spigot!
Perhaps you've heard of me.

06:03.417 --> 06:06.583
I am the stuff
of your worst nightmares.

06:07.834 --> 06:10.375
I am here to claim that idol

06:10.458 --> 06:14.333
for the glory of my mommy land, Thembria!

06:15.458 --> 06:19.834
You are all wasting your time.
The idol is mine.

06:20.208 --> 06:23.333
Anyone who comes between me
and what I want

06:23.417 --> 06:26.375
will be crushed mercilessly
beneath my boot!

06:26.458 --> 06:32.208
The only reason Spigot can find anything
is because he's closer to the ground.

06:32.583 --> 06:33.709
Oops!

06:35.208 --> 06:40.125
Ah, Baloo, what are you doing here,
hunting idols?

06:40.208 --> 06:44.959
Nah, I ordered a three-bean salad
and only got two.

06:45.041 --> 06:48.542
Just hanging around,
waiting for the other to show up.

06:48.625 --> 06:52.208
The only thing you only have
to wait for now the wrath of Spigot!

06:52.291 --> 06:54.208
And you won't have to wait long.

06:54.667 --> 06:56.959
[Baloo]
Right under your nose!

06:57.041 --> 06:59.417
What did you say?

06:59.500 --> 07:03.917
Never mind what he said, short stop.
This is my bar.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.667
And it's what I say that counts.
Now, drop that bear!

07:08.625 --> 07:09.667
[grunts]

07:09.750 --> 07:12.709
Thanks, Louie. I think.

07:13.417 --> 07:18.875
I'll stop by for a short visit, Spiggy,
if I'm ever down your way!

07:22.208 --> 07:24.000
[Baloo] Yahoo-wee!

07:24.083 --> 07:26.250
[Kit]
What's gotten into you, Papa Bear?

07:26.333 --> 07:29.792
[Baloo laughs]
I know what's under my nose!

07:29.875 --> 07:34.000
-[Kit] You know where the idol is?
-Hope to kiss a rhino I do.

07:36.667 --> 07:40.750
Now, look at the map.
Look at Moose Lake.

07:41.500 --> 07:44.208
No, hold the map right side up.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.959
[Kit] Hey, I see it!

07:48.041 --> 07:51.250
Those weren't antlers.
It's a mustache.

07:51.333 --> 07:54.083
By George, I think he's got it.

07:54.166 --> 07:57.750
Arthur Lake... Veronica Lake.

07:57.834 --> 08:00.625
There it is! Moose Lake!

08:00.959 --> 08:04.834
[Baloo] All we have to do is land
and get our idol.

08:04.917 --> 08:09.333
-[Kit] The water looks funny.
-[Baloo] Oh, water's water.

08:09.417 --> 08:11.917
We'll land east of the nostril.

08:14.458 --> 08:17.959
It's like trying to land
on a banana peel!

08:18.041 --> 08:19.625
Land ho!

08:20.583 --> 08:22.917
[both] Whoa!

08:23.583 --> 08:26.166
[yelling]

08:31.542 --> 08:35.958
Like I said,
we'll land west of the nostril.

08:36.082 --> 08:38.000
[Kit straining]

08:38.082 --> 08:43.125
No wonder it was slippery.
This thick goo is mostly oily sludge.

08:43.457 --> 08:45.875
Just keep paddling, kid.

08:45.959 --> 08:50.166
Once we hit that island,
we'll be on easy street.

08:51.625 --> 08:56.083
Easy street, huh?
I'd settle for a nice path.

08:56.458 --> 09:01.417
When we get that idol, you can
buy yourself a highway to play with.

09:02.166 --> 09:04.750
[both] Whoa!

09:06.333 --> 09:08.291
[panting]
We made it.

09:09.125 --> 09:11.291
We should be right under the nose.

09:11.375 --> 09:13.792
Hey, look at this.

09:13.875 --> 09:16.667
I wonder what happens when...
Whoops!

09:17.458 --> 09:19.208
Oh, thanks, Baloo.

09:19.291 --> 09:21.333
No trouble, little britches.

09:21.417 --> 09:24.709
Just never trust a bubble
you don't blow yourself.

09:24.792 --> 09:28.125
Now, let's find
that oversized paperweight

09:28.208 --> 09:29.792
and get out of here.

09:31.834 --> 09:34.792
[Kit]
Do you think it's... booby-trapped?

09:34.875 --> 09:39.792
Does a bear sleep in the woods?
Well, this booby's too smart for them.

09:42.875 --> 09:43.709
What'd I tell you?

09:45.834 --> 09:47.041
[rumbling]

09:47.125 --> 09:48.375
Oops.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.083
Ow!

10:00.250 --> 10:02.667
Oh, that wasn't so bad.

10:04.333 --> 10:05.834
Look out!

10:08.458 --> 10:10.750
We got it, little britches!

10:10.834 --> 10:13.625
And no two people deserve it more!

10:13.709 --> 10:19.166
Yes. And it's so very sad
you won't be able to keep it.

10:19.250 --> 10:20.750
[laughing]

10:24.542 --> 10:26.417
[Baloo]
Now, listen, Spiggy.

10:26.500 --> 10:30.333
It isn't right you jitterbugging in here
and swiping that thingy.

10:30.375 --> 10:35.625
Ah, but it is right, you silly Baloo-boo,
because might makes right,

10:35.709 --> 10:40.125
-and I have the might.
-How'd you find us anyway?

10:40.208 --> 10:43.583
[chuckles]
I simply examined the clues,

10:43.667 --> 10:47.959
and my scintillating intellect
deciphered where the idol was hidden.

10:48.041 --> 10:50.041
Yeah, and then we followed you.

10:50.458 --> 10:53.625
-Who asked you?
-Sorry, colonel.

10:54.458 --> 10:55.625
What is it?

10:56.625 --> 11:00.208
Ah, yes. It's time we departed.

11:00.291 --> 11:05.041
And on the way home, we'll stop
and flaunt my triumph at Louie's.

11:05.125 --> 11:08.208
Just wait till I get my hands on you!

11:08.291 --> 11:11.291
I would love to stay
and finish this delightful conversation,

11:11.375 --> 11:15.750
but I hate the smell of scorched fur.
Farewell.

11:15.834 --> 11:17.083
[all laughing]

11:17.166 --> 11:19.000
[Kit]
I don't suppose you have a knife?

11:19.083 --> 11:23.542
Sorry, Kit. The closest thing I've got
is a shoulder blade.

11:25.041 --> 11:28.208
Whoa!
Hey, you're rocking the boat!

11:28.291 --> 11:31.125
I think... I can...

11:31.208 --> 11:33.041
[straining]

11:33.208 --> 11:34.667
[Baloo] That a boy!

11:46.083 --> 11:49.834
Come on!
Come on!

11:49.917 --> 11:51.583
Oh!

11:51.667 --> 11:56.125
-I can't reach.
-You can't, but we can.

11:56.208 --> 11:57.375
Yeah!

12:00.041 --> 12:01.166
I got it!

12:03.333 --> 12:08.041
-Hang on, buddy!
-I can't hold on much longer!

12:09.333 --> 12:11.250
[Baloo] Don't let go!

12:12.667 --> 12:17.333
Baloo?
Baloo, are you all right?

12:17.417 --> 12:21.250
Whoa!
That's what I call using your head.

12:21.333 --> 12:26.542
Now, if we could just get you
to use my head a little more gently.

12:26.625 --> 12:29.750
Now, let's go get our idol back.

12:32.625 --> 12:35.917
[Spigot]
And so I, the irrepressible Spigot,

12:36.000 --> 12:39.834
have once again displayed
inherent superiority

12:39.917 --> 12:42.625
and insurmountable will!

12:42.709 --> 12:47.208
So, what's a big shot like you
gonna do with that bodacious reward?

12:47.291 --> 12:52.083
Reward? This achievement
was for the glory of Thembria,

12:52.166 --> 12:56.291
where the idol will be displayed
as a trophy to my greatness!

12:56.375 --> 13:00.667
The only place that idol's going
is back in my hands!

13:02.083 --> 13:04.250
-But I found it.
-You stole it!

13:04.333 --> 13:05.417
I found it!

13:05.500 --> 13:07.250
Of course,
you were holding it at the time.

13:07.333 --> 13:11.667
But you prove no match for Spigot,
the might that makes right.

13:11.750 --> 13:15.166
The only right you should
worry about is mine!

13:15.250 --> 13:16.959
And my left, too.

13:17.041 --> 13:19.208
Now, are you going
to give me back that idol,

13:19.291 --> 13:21.375
or are we going to have trouble?

13:24.375 --> 13:25.333
[punching]

13:25.417 --> 13:28.208
-[Baloo yells]
-[crashing]

13:28.542 --> 13:33.041
-Uh, Baloo--
-Not now, kid, I got munchkins to mush.

13:33.125 --> 13:35.625
[clattering]

13:35.709 --> 13:38.041
[yelling]

13:38.125 --> 13:43.458
-Baloo, they're too big!
-Don't worry about me, kid.

13:43.542 --> 13:46.375
The bigger they are,
the harder they punch.

13:47.792 --> 13:50.875
Hey, Baloo, ol' palooka,
you want any backup?

13:50.959 --> 13:55.125
Thanks, Louie.
But this is between me and them.

13:55.834 --> 13:58.583
-[clattering]
-[Baloo yelling]

13:58.667 --> 14:03.166
What Baloo needs between him and them
is about three inches of concrete.

14:03.250 --> 14:06.709
Gentlemen, there's a flyboy in my soup.

14:11.125 --> 14:13.417
They'll never expect an air raid.

14:13.959 --> 14:17.166
-[yelling]
-[crashing]

14:17.250 --> 14:20.625
All right, no more Mr. Nice Guy.

14:22.291 --> 14:24.458
[yelling]

14:25.250 --> 14:28.667
-Baloo, wait.
-Just give me a minute, kid.

14:28.750 --> 14:30.792
I'll get it this time for sure.

14:30.875 --> 14:35.625
Papa Bear, you're outnumbered,
and you're outmuscled.

14:35.709 --> 14:39.458
Isn't it about time
you start using your head?

14:40.333 --> 14:43.083
Where'd you get a silly idea like that?

14:43.166 --> 14:45.083
-You taught me.
-Huh?

14:45.166 --> 14:48.458
You know, smart, subtle.

14:50.250 --> 14:51.875
Yeah, yeah, I remember.

14:51.959 --> 14:54.709
So, why am I driving myself crazy

14:54.792 --> 14:59.542
when we can have a lot more fun
driving Spiggy crazy?

14:59.625 --> 15:03.333
By George, I think Spigot's
going to get it.

15:15.500 --> 15:19.542
Eat your hearts out,
you paltry peasants.

15:19.917 --> 15:24.125
Ya-ha-ha!
It's you! It's you!

15:24.208 --> 15:28.875
Oh, you horrible shrunken piece
of supernatural nastiness!

15:28.959 --> 15:31.208
Are you speaking of Colonel Spigot?

15:31.291 --> 15:34.500
Oh, no round one,
I am speaking to

15:34.583 --> 15:37.667
the other horrible shrunken piece
of supernatural nastiness.

15:37.750 --> 15:39.625
Oh, that's all right then.

15:39.709 --> 15:43.625
-Ow! Sorry.
-What's the meaning of this?

15:43.709 --> 15:48.375
O mighty small one, the idol,
it is cursed! Cursed!

15:48.458 --> 15:51.417
Cursed? Don't be ridiculous.
Hold this.

15:51.542 --> 15:55.709
It is true. Unless you keep
your eye on it every moment,

15:55.792 --> 15:58.875
it will drive you mad! Mad!

15:58.959 --> 16:04.208
Get rid of it before it's too late.
[yelling]

16:04.417 --> 16:06.583
Fool! Give me that.

16:06.959 --> 16:08.917
I'm watching you.

16:10.166 --> 16:11.625
[yells]

16:18.417 --> 16:22.000
[Spigot]
Everything is under my complete control.

16:22.083 --> 16:24.083
The idol will stay in that case

16:24.166 --> 16:28.750
until I personally ensconce it
in the National Museum of Thembria!

16:28.834 --> 16:33.750
Now, go up and make sure
this is a smooth trip home.

16:33.834 --> 16:36.333
I don't wish to be disturbed.

16:39.500 --> 16:44.125
OK, little britches!
Time to make our curse come true!

17:11.040 --> 17:12.125
[yells]

17:16.208 --> 17:20.250
Dang it, I have to lay off
of Louie's banana burritos.

17:22.625 --> 17:23.666
Hmm?

17:37.208 --> 17:38.166
[blows raspberry]

17:41.417 --> 17:43.417
[grumbling]

17:45.375 --> 17:48.041
Wakey, wakey, short pants.

17:48.125 --> 17:50.041
[yelling]

17:54.375 --> 17:55.583
Hmm?

17:56.458 --> 17:57.792
Nah!

17:59.834 --> 18:03.125
Dunder, come here at once!

18:03.417 --> 18:05.417
You called, colonel?
Ow!

18:05.500 --> 18:08.917
Whatever you were doing,
don't do it anymore.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.125
Yes, sir. I'm terribly sorry, sir.

18:11.208 --> 18:16.125
Now, get out!
And I don't want any more disturbances.

18:16.208 --> 18:18.166
Yes, sir.
I mean, no, sir!

18:23.875 --> 18:27.125
Dunder, come here at once!

18:28.083 --> 18:29.667
[snoring]

18:30.583 --> 18:32.458
You called, colonel?

18:33.667 --> 18:36.083
No, I did not call, colonel!

18:36.166 --> 18:37.667
But someone did.

18:37.750 --> 18:39.500
Hmm...

18:40.458 --> 18:43.417
That nasty idol's
not bothering you, is it, colonel?

18:43.500 --> 18:47.375
No, no, no!
That idol is not bothering me.

18:47.458 --> 18:50.792
Only small minds yield to superstition.

18:50.875 --> 18:55.125
-Now leave me alone!
-Sorry.

18:57.625 --> 19:00.208
You don't frighten me.

19:00.291 --> 19:03.917
I will not succumb to your wily ways.

19:04.000 --> 19:07.458
You see how unconcerned I am, see?
See?

19:07.542 --> 19:09.250
[yelling]

19:10.709 --> 19:12.792
[yells]

19:16.834 --> 19:20.041
Dunder!

19:20.375 --> 19:21.250
Colonel?

19:21.333 --> 19:24.542
The idol! That nasty wooden thing,
it's trying to get me!

19:24.625 --> 19:26.583
The idol is trying to get you?

19:26.667 --> 19:31.375
The idol was not doing anything!
It is just a piece of wood.

19:31.834 --> 19:34.250
-But you said--
-Don't listen to what I said!

19:34.333 --> 19:36.875
Listen to what I'm saying.

19:36.959 --> 19:39.291
I simply need a little rest.

19:39.375 --> 19:43.333
I'm somewhat taxed
by my overwhelming triumph.

19:43.417 --> 19:49.250
I will not be disturbed.
Understand?

19:49.333 --> 19:51.458
[gulps] Yes, sir.

20:03.500 --> 20:05.250
[snoring]

20:13.750 --> 20:15.542
[both laughing]

20:15.625 --> 20:17.917
-Got the clue?
-Yes.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.625
[chuckling]

20:23.959 --> 20:26.417
[snoring]

20:31.417 --> 20:33.208
[yells]

20:38.667 --> 20:39.834
[coughs]

20:39.917 --> 20:40.875
[yells]

20:48.333 --> 20:49.917
[yells]

21:00.875 --> 21:03.333
I believe!
I believe! I believe!

21:07.000 --> 21:09.917
Be gone, you nasty doodad you!

21:18.000 --> 21:19.709
Thanks, colonel!

21:19.792 --> 21:22.417
Nice to see you've changed your mind!

21:23.667 --> 21:26.542
Dunder!

21:27.250 --> 21:30.834
[Baloo] That's right, Becky,
you can save your "I told you so's,"

21:30.917 --> 21:33.291
and break out the pink slip
on the <i>Sea Duck.</i>

21:33.375 --> 21:37.417
Papa's coming home
with his pockets full of torbits!

21:37.500 --> 21:40.125
That'll be eight shaboozis, Baloo.

21:40.208 --> 21:41.458
Hold on, Becky.

21:41.959 --> 21:45.750
I haven't got any shaboozis right now.
What'll it be in torbits?

21:46.500 --> 21:50.834
Well, let me see.
At the current rate of exchange...

21:50.917 --> 21:53.250
[Baloo] You know, Rebecca,
if you play your cards right,

21:53.333 --> 21:56.417
I might be able to give you a job.

21:56.834 --> 22:00.208
Uh, including ice cream tab,
sales tax, and tip,

22:00.291 --> 22:04.750
it comes to 13 million torbits,
right on the mazuma.

22:04.834 --> 22:06.166
[gulps]

22:06.250 --> 22:09.834
Rebecca, I'll be back to work tomorrow.

22:09.917 --> 22:14.417
Oh, um, and can I reverse the charges?
