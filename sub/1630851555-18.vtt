WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:12.387
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:38.079 --> 00:38.913
Jordi.

01:10.278 --> 01:12.822
We can't risk him talking to Rogelio.

02:19.389 --> 02:22.350
-Did they say anything?
-Just to go to the back.

02:29.107 --> 02:32.110
What's up? Why are you guys outside?

02:33.111 --> 02:35.196
We're hiding from Rogelio.

02:35.280 --> 02:37.157
Come. This is Jordi.

02:41.077 --> 02:41.911
Lorenzo.

02:42.996 --> 02:45.582
She's my sister. Ana.

02:46.207 --> 02:49.127
-What?
-Ana and Bautista fled The Aquarium.

02:49.711 --> 02:52.630
-Rogelio was suspicious of me.
-He's been spying on us.

02:53.882 --> 02:55.049
He made the video.

02:55.884 --> 02:59.179
-He wants to screw us over.
-Rogelio Marroquín?

02:59.679 --> 03:01.014
What? My grandpa?

03:02.223 --> 03:04.934
What are you talking about?
I don't understand.

03:11.816 --> 03:14.861
Did you do a paternity test for Federico?

03:20.074 --> 03:21.784
What are you trying to prove?

03:28.416 --> 03:29.334
Sit down.

03:35.757 --> 03:38.009
We were together just once.

03:39.969 --> 03:41.054
So I didn't think…

04:00.323 --> 04:03.368
I'm telling you,
he's planned this since the wake.

04:03.451 --> 04:06.996
He says we're his beloved granddaughters,
but it's all a lie.

04:09.499 --> 04:11.292
Who does all this for revenge?

04:11.834 --> 04:13.920
Rogelio's never been normal.

04:15.088 --> 04:16.464
Simón wasn't either.

04:17.090 --> 04:18.758
Víctor should report him.

04:19.842 --> 04:22.929
Nothing he did was illegal.
Not even the cameras.

04:23.638 --> 04:26.057
What about money-laundering at the club?

04:26.140 --> 04:27.976
It's registered to me, Camilo.

04:30.561 --> 04:33.773
And I'm a stripper.
Who will they believe, Lorenzo?

04:37.485 --> 04:39.737
So, are we screwed or what?

04:40.613 --> 04:43.074
No. We have to do something.

04:47.787 --> 04:49.247
-Aunt.
-Valentina.

04:49.330 --> 04:51.916
-I couldn't wait until tomorrow.
-What's up?

04:52.000 --> 04:54.627
Manny said
she's being investigated, right?

04:54.711 --> 04:56.504
It's all Rogelio's doing.

04:57.088 --> 04:58.715
How do you know that?

05:00.049 --> 05:02.343
What's happening
at Manny's club isn't new.

05:02.427 --> 05:05.847
Rogelio's been laundering money
since my dad was his accountant.

05:05.930 --> 05:08.975
After what happened to Rosa,
he decided to document it all.

05:09.058 --> 05:12.353
-Like a form of life insurance.
-What if we turn in the books?

05:12.437 --> 05:15.982
Rogelio isn't linked to the companies,
so it proves nothing.

05:16.065 --> 05:17.442
He's untouchable.

05:17.525 --> 05:21.279
Of course not. He must be linked somehow.

05:22.238 --> 05:25.116
Shell companies are created to hide funds.

05:25.700 --> 05:30.455
-Hence Bautista's abduction.
-And that's how he knows Andrade.

05:35.335 --> 05:38.212
My grandpa
runs a human trafficking network?

05:38.296 --> 05:40.590
He's the boss.
Hence the ring and the fish.

05:40.673 --> 05:42.925
That's how he marks his merchandise.

05:47.930 --> 05:51.267
They did this to me at The Aquarium.

05:53.644 --> 05:55.563
My mom was just trying to protect us.

06:00.485 --> 06:01.527
Rogelio is Tiburón.

06:05.406 --> 06:06.616
Where are you going?

06:06.699 --> 06:09.702
To finish what Alice couldn't.
I'm going to kill the scumbag.

06:09.786 --> 06:13.414
-Wait, Manny. We'll get him.
-Didn't you hear we have nothing?

06:17.085 --> 06:20.004
We need an insider
to expose him with proof.

06:20.088 --> 06:21.506
Barracuda runs The Aquarium.

06:21.589 --> 06:25.134
It has to be him. He's the only one
that contacts Tiburón directly.

06:25.218 --> 06:26.427
Do you know who it is?

06:26.511 --> 06:29.389
It must be someone important,
maybe a politician.

06:30.723 --> 06:31.974
How was the meeting?

06:32.058 --> 06:34.435
They gave me The Aquarium, man.

06:34.519 --> 06:35.353
Let's go.

06:38.940 --> 06:40.191
Suárez, the prosecutor.

06:43.653 --> 06:44.487
It's him.

06:45.488 --> 06:46.489
He's Barracuda.

06:56.499 --> 06:57.333
Excuse me.

07:01.712 --> 07:02.588
Why, Víctor?

07:03.214 --> 07:05.800
How could you stoop so low?

07:10.179 --> 07:15.184
I was raised to bow my head, Fede.
To obey, be grateful for a roof and food.

07:15.268 --> 07:16.102
What about me?

07:20.982 --> 07:22.275
You're my buddy.

07:22.900 --> 07:25.403
You were always there
when my Dad scolded me.

07:28.614 --> 07:31.868
You covered up my first bender,
helped me with my girlfriends.

07:31.951 --> 07:34.954
I tried to stop him from hurting you.
That's all.

07:35.037 --> 07:37.123
-I'm his grandson.
-And I'm his son.

07:41.127 --> 07:44.422
I found out after 40 years
of being treated like dirt.

07:46.799 --> 07:48.009
I'm your uncle.

07:51.637 --> 07:53.681
Your grandpa only cares about himself.

07:53.764 --> 07:56.392
We're just pieces of his damn puzzles.

08:00.646 --> 08:01.731
Release me.

08:03.774 --> 08:06.777
You don't trust me,
but I swear to keep quiet.

08:06.861 --> 08:08.738
The bastard can go to Hell.

08:12.408 --> 08:13.493
Release me, Fede.

08:48.736 --> 08:50.696
I don't want to ever see you again.

09:17.807 --> 09:19.684
Where were you all night?

09:19.767 --> 09:23.479
Driving around. I needed to think.

09:34.574 --> 09:37.118
I've missed 25 years…

09:40.037 --> 09:42.832
of watching my kid grow up.

09:46.794 --> 09:47.628
Come.

09:48.337 --> 09:53.384
You've always been close to him, Ignacio.
Why do you think he worships you?

09:54.218 --> 09:56.846
If only you knew how many times he told me

09:56.929 --> 10:00.391
he wanted you to be his dad, not Simón.

10:02.810 --> 10:05.062
And I was so stupid not to realize.

10:06.647 --> 10:08.608
Of course you're his dad.

10:09.275 --> 10:11.402
He's exactly like you.

10:13.904 --> 10:15.698
How long have you worked here?

10:16.240 --> 10:19.160
The boss hired me
a week before you guys arrived.

10:19.827 --> 10:21.037
Why? I don't know.

10:22.204 --> 10:24.874
He obviously focused a lot on the decor.

10:24.957 --> 10:29.128
Yes, he wanted it to be perfect.
Even when he brought in the paintings.

10:29.795 --> 10:31.672
Look what I found in the kitchen.

10:33.382 --> 10:35.926
It's the puzzle he had made for you guys.

10:36.427 --> 10:38.888
Five fish. Five granddaughters.

10:39.805 --> 10:41.557
He really loves you guys.

10:42.058 --> 10:44.810
So, we are the little fish.

10:45.811 --> 10:47.521
Trapped in an aquarium.

10:49.315 --> 10:52.902
What does the shark mean? I don't get it.

10:53.653 --> 10:55.404
He loves playing games.

10:55.488 --> 10:57.490
LIBRARY

10:59.950 --> 11:01.535
No. You can't go in there.

11:05.122 --> 11:05.956
Márquez?

11:07.249 --> 11:08.250
Why are you here?

11:10.461 --> 11:13.214
To be reinstated for a special mission.

11:19.512 --> 11:20.513
What are you doing?

11:20.596 --> 11:25.434
I'm wiping Manny and Carmela's names
from any registries linked to the club.

11:25.518 --> 11:28.604
When I'm done, I'll focus on The Aquarium.

11:29.855 --> 11:31.065
"I'm such a genius."

11:32.149 --> 11:34.318
-Hello.
-Good morning.

11:35.361 --> 11:36.195
Thanks.

11:40.282 --> 11:41.200
Thanks.

11:44.286 --> 11:46.288
CABRILLA
LEADER

11:48.916 --> 11:50.876
I guess he's going to jail now.

11:55.005 --> 11:58.008
A present from El Chango, Cabrilla.
You filthy rat.

12:03.973 --> 12:04.807
No.

12:07.685 --> 12:09.937
The captain asked me to be discreet.

12:10.604 --> 12:11.856
And the rest of the plan?

12:12.356 --> 12:13.441
I'm working on it.

12:13.941 --> 12:15.192
You coming to the club?

12:16.193 --> 12:17.862
I have to do something first.

12:17.945 --> 12:19.530
Okay. See you soon.

12:19.613 --> 12:20.448
Alright.

12:20.990 --> 12:22.241
Be careful, please.

12:22.992 --> 12:24.243
-I love you.
-Me too.

12:46.891 --> 12:48.934
DON'T SAY ANYTHING
I KNOW WHERE THEY ARE!

12:49.018 --> 12:51.812
Save us time and tell us
where you keep the forged IDs.

12:53.063 --> 12:55.983
We know you forged them. We'll find them.

12:59.320 --> 13:00.154
Nothing?

13:00.237 --> 13:04.408
If you don't talk, your accomplices will
go free and you face the charges alone.

13:06.243 --> 13:11.832
As I already said,
I don't know what fake IDs you mean.

13:11.916 --> 13:15.711
My business is printing fliers, cards,

13:15.795 --> 13:19.632
invitations to weddings and baptisms.

13:19.715 --> 13:20.549
I warned you.

13:32.561 --> 13:34.563
Manny spoke with the prosecutor.

13:35.856 --> 13:40.611
She says it's going according to plan,
but I am so nervous.

13:46.867 --> 13:48.702
Oh, Isabel.

13:57.461 --> 13:59.713
I'll get some tea.

14:07.596 --> 14:08.722
How is Matilde?

14:08.806 --> 14:11.809
She'll be fine once she clears things up
with her dad.

14:11.892 --> 14:15.145
Tell her not to worry.
I'll speak with him.

14:15.229 --> 14:16.897
Sure, I'll tell her.

14:21.819 --> 14:22.945
You don't have to go.

14:23.654 --> 14:26.240
The brewery doesn't need me now and…

14:28.909 --> 14:31.203
I'm tired of competing with your sister.

14:32.288 --> 14:35.165
I saw you kissing Valentina
at the opening.

14:37.459 --> 14:41.547
-Isabel, she and I--
-I know the story, that's why I stayed.

14:43.173 --> 14:45.718
But I've had enough.

14:47.052 --> 14:48.596
I deserve something else.

14:49.471 --> 14:50.306
Yes.

14:52.558 --> 14:53.392
Forgive me.

14:55.477 --> 14:57.229
I never meant to hurt you.

14:59.064 --> 14:59.899
I know.

15:13.287 --> 15:15.497
I hope you'll be very happy.

15:15.581 --> 15:17.833
Thanks. You too.

15:23.589 --> 15:24.423
Bye.

15:38.562 --> 15:39.563
Oh, man!

15:42.149 --> 15:44.735
-Straight to the club.
-Yes, sir.

15:49.323 --> 15:50.741
What are you doing here?

15:53.744 --> 15:58.415
Working as a driver again.
You know what it's like, sir.

16:02.002 --> 16:06.090
Back to the same club?
Manny doesn't do private shows anymore.

16:06.882 --> 16:07.758
Yes.

16:08.842 --> 16:11.804
She doesn't do private shows
for the help like you.

16:13.347 --> 16:16.308
-Nice to see you too, sir.
-You too, man.

16:17.768 --> 16:19.561
I'm going to fuck Manny today.

16:20.521 --> 16:23.023
She owes me a favor and it's payback time.

16:26.610 --> 16:30.447
But that's impossible.
Why is her name missing? She's the owner.

16:30.948 --> 16:34.910
We found nothing linking her to the club
or with the Spanish branch.

16:35.494 --> 16:36.954
She must've deleted it.

16:37.037 --> 16:42.126
Or the data was wrong from day one.
Or maybe we hit the jackpot, Lozano.

16:42.209 --> 16:43.794
What jackpot?

16:43.877 --> 16:47.047
We found a link between this company
and others from years ago.

16:47.548 --> 16:50.467
The fish is a lot bigger
than Juana Manuela Bravo.

16:58.517 --> 16:59.351
Manny.

17:00.394 --> 17:03.355
Watch out for him.
He's high out of his mind.

17:03.939 --> 17:05.691
I know what I'm doing. Go on.

17:13.532 --> 17:14.366
Sir.

17:15.659 --> 17:16.493
Come in.

17:18.954 --> 17:20.956
Things have changed. Right, Manny?

17:22.916 --> 17:23.834
Manny.

17:28.297 --> 17:29.214
You were right.

17:30.799 --> 17:31.633
You're a genius.

17:32.843 --> 17:34.845
I'd be screwed it weren't for you.

17:36.055 --> 17:36.889
That's right.

17:40.350 --> 17:41.810
I'm all about numbers.

17:43.187 --> 17:44.271
The accounting.

17:46.315 --> 17:48.108
That's how they got Al Capone.

17:50.110 --> 17:51.028
And I think…

17:52.654 --> 17:58.368
we could find a way to celebrate, right?

18:04.333 --> 18:06.210
I'm going to get someone to join us.

18:07.211 --> 18:08.045
Nina?

18:14.760 --> 18:17.221
Badass.

18:20.808 --> 18:21.934
Oh, man!

18:26.772 --> 18:27.940
What do you want?

18:28.816 --> 18:30.150
Who the hell are you?

18:34.113 --> 18:36.990
Investigative Unit.
Detective Lorenzo Márquez.

18:38.033 --> 18:40.911
Sorry to interrupt you, sir.

18:59.555 --> 19:03.142
Seeing you last night is the only
good thing that has happened in days.

19:05.602 --> 19:06.645
I've missed you.

19:09.356 --> 19:12.568
Sometimes I imagine you're with me
to fall asleep.

19:15.112 --> 19:17.990
When something good happens,
I want to tell you about it.

19:20.701 --> 19:23.120
My mom says it's because
I'm in love with you.

19:27.875 --> 19:29.877
That I'm being a moron because…

19:31.587 --> 19:33.505
love means losing control.

19:36.925 --> 19:38.135
And that scares me.

19:43.265 --> 19:45.184
That I'd be a fool to lose you.

19:48.687 --> 19:49.980
Have I lost you already?

19:53.901 --> 19:54.818
Lost me?

20:05.954 --> 20:08.081
The only one that's lost here is me.

20:22.471 --> 20:24.973
You have no idea, dude…

20:26.475 --> 20:28.101
who these guys are.

20:29.519 --> 20:31.688
You don't know who you're messing with.

20:31.772 --> 20:33.273
Why do you think we're here?

20:34.316 --> 20:37.152
They're watching you.
You're here to have a good time.

20:38.278 --> 20:39.780
They won't suspect a thing.

20:39.863 --> 20:41.949
But I can't rat on him.

20:43.784 --> 20:46.495
If I rat on Rogelio, I'm dead.

20:46.578 --> 20:48.080
You're dead anyway.

20:50.249 --> 20:53.001
What will Marroquín do if you go to jail?

20:53.669 --> 20:54.628
Laugh?

20:55.587 --> 20:58.465
Only you can confirm Tiburón's identity.

20:58.548 --> 21:00.509
No way, I can't.

21:00.592 --> 21:03.720
Testify against him,
we'll arrest him tomorrow,

21:03.804 --> 21:06.056
and you and your family will go far away.

21:06.556 --> 21:07.474
You have my word.

21:14.439 --> 21:18.610
I need to brief the captain
and get ready for him to come in tomorrow.

21:20.737 --> 21:22.906
Do I take him to the hotel as usual?

21:22.990 --> 21:24.950
Yes, my men will follow you.

21:25.033 --> 21:27.703
They'll stay outside his door all night.

21:27.786 --> 21:29.663
In case he feels like fleeing.

21:34.084 --> 21:37.671
When this is over,
you're not leaving my bed for three days.

21:50.392 --> 21:51.893
Hey! Where are you going?

21:53.437 --> 21:56.857
Tell me how you removed your name
from the club's registry.

21:56.940 --> 22:01.278
-What's the matter, Sánchez?
-It's not Sánchez! It's Antonio Lozano!

22:03.071 --> 22:06.700
You got away again.
But you're dead next time, bitch!

22:08.285 --> 22:11.455
I begged Marcela
to patch things up with you.

22:12.122 --> 22:14.458
-You got her into that shit!
-I got her out.

22:14.541 --> 22:19.629
I kept an eye on her 24/7 for months
so she wouldn't relapse.

22:20.464 --> 22:25.677
And the one day I wasn't there,
I found her unconscious.

22:27.471 --> 22:29.306
There was nothing I could do.

22:32.559 --> 22:35.437
I'm the bitch
that couldn't save your daughter.

22:43.403 --> 22:44.696
How did you find me?

22:45.197 --> 22:49.242
Someone phoned me.
They must've guessed I was after you.

22:50.911 --> 22:51.912
That scumbag.

22:53.747 --> 22:55.082
Rogelio Marroquín.

22:57.084 --> 22:58.251
Never heard of him.

22:59.294 --> 23:01.713
With the info I'll give you
you'll get a medal.

23:22.150 --> 23:23.777
Fish die by the mouth.

23:24.611 --> 23:28.031
Only if they take the bait, right?

24:01.064 --> 24:03.024
Stop! You can't leave!

24:03.108 --> 24:06.027
-Suárez, what are you doing?
-Stop! No!

24:29.634 --> 24:30.552
Yes, Castro?

24:32.053 --> 24:33.138
He killed himself?

24:39.227 --> 24:41.771
SIMÓN'S CELL PHONE

24:50.697 --> 24:54.784
I expected a different reaction.
You know what that tape means?

24:55.368 --> 24:57.120
Nothing surprises me about Grandpa.

24:58.079 --> 25:00.415
He put spy cameras in the hotel.

25:01.041 --> 25:02.876
He taped Valentina and me.

25:02.959 --> 25:04.294
-What?
-Yes.

25:11.718 --> 25:12.552
What's up?

25:18.266 --> 25:19.476
Hold on.

25:20.894 --> 25:22.938
The cops are en route to arrest Grandpa.

25:26.066 --> 25:28.235
Wait, I haven't even told you half of it.

25:29.110 --> 25:32.489
When we have more time,
I need to tell you something too.

25:34.366 --> 25:35.700
You there, Valentina?

25:37.369 --> 25:39.871
Weren't they going to arrest him tomorrow?

25:57.305 --> 25:59.224
Berta. Is Víctor back?

26:01.226 --> 26:02.477
God damn it!

26:04.771 --> 26:05.855
Go.

26:09.901 --> 26:11.069
To my right!

26:11.152 --> 26:12.153
Left!

26:22.831 --> 26:23.748
Rogelio.

26:32.799 --> 26:34.509
Camacho, move in.

27:05.624 --> 27:06.708
Rogelio Marroquín.

27:09.377 --> 27:10.587
What's this about?

27:21.848 --> 27:22.724
Let's go.

27:22.807 --> 27:23.725
Don't touch me.

27:26.227 --> 27:27.979
Don't you know who I am?

27:29.773 --> 27:30.690
You're Tiburón.

27:32.817 --> 27:37.656
You're under arrest for money laundering,
organized crime, and tax evasion.

27:39.157 --> 27:39.991
Let's go.

27:43.953 --> 27:45.038
Gather the ashes.

28:02.180 --> 28:03.014
Detective.

28:03.973 --> 28:07.644
My brother Simón left a message
on his phone accusing him.

28:08.728 --> 28:10.647
I'm sure he killed him that night.

28:10.730 --> 28:11.648
My God!

28:15.527 --> 28:17.445
You lost your family, man.

28:19.406 --> 28:23.284
Federico is my son. He's not Simón's son.

28:44.222 --> 28:45.098
Is that true?

28:46.933 --> 28:47.767
Are you…

28:48.643 --> 28:49.477
You're my dad?

28:56.901 --> 28:57.777
Yes.

28:58.278 --> 29:00.822
Sorry.
I didn't want you to find out like this.

29:05.785 --> 29:09.581
I've loved your mom
since before she was married.

29:11.249 --> 29:12.792
It's not her fault.

29:13.376 --> 29:17.714
She didn't know,
she had a paternity test done and…

29:18.465 --> 29:20.800
That's why I don't have the birthmark.

29:23.595 --> 29:28.099
I know it's tough to hear.
We have lots of time to…

29:38.985 --> 29:41.112
I'm so happy to hear this.

29:41.696 --> 29:42.739
Me too.

29:46.868 --> 29:50.455
Lozano's men can verify
the shell companies thanks to Jordi,

29:50.538 --> 29:52.749
but sadly, that's not enough.

29:54.501 --> 29:56.920
People go to jail for a lot less.

29:57.003 --> 30:00.965
Federico says Rogelio's friends with all
of Mexico's congressmen and judges.

30:01.049 --> 30:03.426
They pass his calls on to the president.

30:03.510 --> 30:06.221
-They're probably in on it.
-Or VIP Aquarium clients.

30:06.304 --> 30:09.182
Without Suárez and with the army
of attorneys he has,

30:09.265 --> 30:12.936
he'll be back home in days
waiting for a trial that'll take years.

30:24.072 --> 30:26.491
Why do bad people get off so easily?

30:27.408 --> 30:32.080
While others like my mom or the women
in the home die trying to survive?

30:33.373 --> 30:36.751
I don't understand life. It's so unfair.

30:39.295 --> 30:41.840
That's why you're right about intervening.

30:48.805 --> 30:50.723
It was exactly where you said.

30:51.224 --> 30:54.394
-I won't get you involved in my problems.
-What problems?

30:54.894 --> 30:59.148
There were only fliers, cards,
invitations to weddings and christenings.

31:03.653 --> 31:05.613
-I love you.
-I love you, too.

31:13.454 --> 31:14.581
Door.

31:22.589 --> 31:25.675
I said I want
to speak to my attorneys in person.

31:35.977 --> 31:36.811
Hello.

31:36.895 --> 31:37.729
Boss.

31:37.812 --> 31:41.190
Víctor, nice time to show up.

31:42.025 --> 31:44.319
You think I can stand this pigsty?

31:44.819 --> 31:47.530
Don't worry, Boss.
I got you a special cell.

31:47.614 --> 31:49.032
For special inmates.

31:49.616 --> 31:51.659
Two of the guards are my buddies.

31:51.743 --> 31:56.247
I need you to find San Millán and Roa
right away.

31:56.331 --> 32:00.293
These morons think they can do
whatever they want to me.

32:00.793 --> 32:02.128
What if they lock you up?

32:02.712 --> 32:05.298
People like me don't do time.
Don't be stupid.

32:05.381 --> 32:06.883
This is like a building.

32:07.842 --> 32:11.346
The higher up your friends live,
the more protected you are.

32:11.888 --> 32:15.058
Mine are in the penthouse.

32:15.683 --> 32:18.686
Make sure my lawyers are here
first thing tomorrow.

32:21.606 --> 32:22.774
Are you listening?

32:24.275 --> 32:26.152
Víctor! Can you hear me?

32:28.696 --> 32:29.864
My mom is alive.

32:31.532 --> 32:33.201
I found her.

32:33.284 --> 32:35.411
That's why I was gone all day, Boss.

32:36.204 --> 32:41.084
She's back in her village,
but she won't forget what you did for her.

32:44.128 --> 32:45.171
Me neither, Boss.

32:46.547 --> 32:51.344
I'm not a Marroquín,
but you're like a father to me.

32:51.427 --> 32:52.512
That's enough.

32:53.262 --> 32:56.808
I don't have time for this corny crap.
Hang up and do as I say.

32:57.642 --> 33:00.937
I'll take care of it, Boss. Don't worry.

33:01.813 --> 33:02.730
As always.

33:16.536 --> 33:17.370
Door.

33:20.498 --> 33:21.749
Door.

33:25.086 --> 33:25.962
Door.

33:37.890 --> 33:39.225
This is the special cell?

33:39.308 --> 33:42.520
It's isolated. Nobody can bother you here.

33:43.187 --> 33:44.939
Víctor is my good friend.

33:45.732 --> 33:47.859
He sent you that to help you relax.

34:06.210 --> 34:07.587
Easy, sir.

34:08.171 --> 34:12.341
Don't do anything stupid.
Nobody can help you in here.

34:17.805 --> 34:18.973
Rich guys like you…

34:20.475 --> 34:22.435
sometimes prefer anything

34:22.518 --> 34:24.896
to the shame of being in jail.

34:25.521 --> 34:29.400
What you said about a building is right.

34:29.484 --> 34:32.070
About having
powerful, well-connected buddies.

34:33.196 --> 34:37.116
But the best guys don't live upstairs.

34:38.951 --> 34:40.453
It's us in the basement.

34:53.800 --> 34:54.634
Door.

34:57.178 --> 34:58.012
Door.

35:02.475 --> 35:03.309
Door.

35:05.728 --> 35:06.562
Door.

35:20.827 --> 35:21.953
Hello.

35:22.995 --> 35:23.955
Yes, it's me.

35:40.012 --> 35:41.013
It's my dad.

35:42.890 --> 35:45.101
They found him hanging in his cell.

35:49.438 --> 35:50.690
He killed himself.

35:57.947 --> 36:00.283
They think the network
spans several countries…

36:00.366 --> 36:03.703
HUMAN TRAFFICKING RING DISMANTLED
15 WOMEN RESCUED FROM A WAREHOUSE

36:03.786 --> 36:07.623
…and that at least a dozen Mexican
businessmen and politicians are involved,

36:07.707 --> 36:10.793
including Yucatan mayor Miguel Andrade

36:10.877 --> 36:15.256
who was murdered in Mérida
in an apparent score-settling.

36:16.299 --> 36:19.802
It was all triggered by the suicide
of prosecutor Ernesto Suárez,

36:19.886 --> 36:24.015
the alleged gang leader
in whose hotel room

36:24.098 --> 36:26.851
several phones and documents were found

36:26.934 --> 36:30.021
which identify the suspects.

36:30.104 --> 36:33.274
Suárez apparently ran
several shell companies

36:33.357 --> 36:35.568
to launder the money.

36:36.861 --> 36:40.615
The police also discovered
a huge piece of property

36:40.698 --> 36:44.535
200 kilometers from Mexico City
called The Aquarium,

36:44.619 --> 36:48.623
where women were held to be sold abroad.

36:48.706 --> 36:53.085
It seems to have been vacated
just hours before the raid

36:53.169 --> 36:57.131
and no one knows the whereabouts
of the abducted women.

37:01.177 --> 37:06.390
Sources close to the investigation say an
expert hacker working with the authorities

37:06.474 --> 37:10.144
was crucial in locating the sordid place,

37:10.228 --> 37:13.147
which was operating for decades,

37:13.231 --> 37:16.651
all thanks to the interception of messages

37:16.734 --> 37:20.988
and information from two young ladies
who a guard helped escape.

37:24.200 --> 37:25.743
In other news,

37:25.826 --> 37:30.373
the prestigious attorney Rogelio Marroquín
was laid to rest.

37:30.456 --> 37:31.791
MARROQUÍN COMMITS SUICIDE

37:31.874 --> 37:34.877
He took his own life
while being held at the penitentiary.

37:34.961 --> 37:39.173
It was a private ceremony
for family members only.

37:48.808 --> 37:50.893
Suspected of money laundering,

37:50.977 --> 37:54.897
Marroquín lost his wife Eloísa Santisteban

37:54.981 --> 37:57.400
and more recently, his youngest son,

37:57.483 --> 38:00.611
Justice Minister nominee Simón Marroquín,

38:00.695 --> 38:03.072
in almost identical circumstances.

38:03.155 --> 38:07.410
Although his attorneys
demand a thorough investigation,

38:07.493 --> 38:10.705
Ignacio and Federico Marroquín,
his only survivors,

38:10.788 --> 38:14.417
say they will not sue the penitentiary.

38:20.298 --> 38:22.049
Is it terrible for me to say…

38:23.467 --> 38:24.969
I'm glad he's dead?

38:25.803 --> 38:30.474
He abducted and sold women.
It's the least he deserved.

38:31.517 --> 38:36.439
It's awful, but whoever killed him
did mankind a favor.

38:36.522 --> 38:38.065
And I'm not exaggerating.

38:39.692 --> 38:41.861
What about Víctor?

38:43.487 --> 38:46.490
We won't hear from him for a long time.

38:47.283 --> 38:49.994
He'll stay far away from me and Federico.

38:52.204 --> 38:53.039
Done.

38:53.622 --> 38:54.999
The house is clean.

38:56.459 --> 38:58.127
This is all that's left.

38:58.794 --> 38:59.628
And that?

39:00.588 --> 39:02.214
I say we burn it.

39:02.798 --> 39:05.343
What's a jigsaw puzzle expert's
worst nightmare?

39:05.426 --> 39:06.510
Not completing it.

39:08.596 --> 39:11.807
Let's keep it as a reminder.

39:14.101 --> 39:15.936
To a new start.

39:16.687 --> 39:18.064
To our moms.

39:18.898 --> 39:20.608
To that damn birthmark.

39:21.942 --> 39:22.943
To fate.

39:24.153 --> 39:25.071
To the Juanas.

39:25.738 --> 39:27.073
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

39:27.656 --> 39:29.575
Look. They're all here.

39:57.311 --> 39:58.771
To the Juanas!

40:25.631 --> 40:27.842
The food is ready!

40:30.177 --> 40:32.179
Juana. Did you hear me?

40:33.472 --> 40:34.390
Coming.

42:07.191 --> 42:09.360
