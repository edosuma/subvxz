WEBVTT

01:27.796 --> 01:29.214
Who's the girl?

01:29.255 --> 01:32.717
Lou Simms.
She's actually kinda decent.

01:41.726 --> 01:44.646
- Sick?
- No.

01:47.482 --> 01:49.526
I can't get fucking sick
right now.

01:49.567 --> 01:50.860
Get out.

02:06.084 --> 02:08.503
Are you blowing me off, sis?
You didn't respond to my text.

02:08.545 --> 02:11.798
- I didn't get one, brother.
- Bullshit.

02:11.840 --> 02:13.550
You got a dress
that doesn't make you look

02:13.591 --> 02:14.634
like an extra from "Westworld"?

02:14.676 --> 02:15.635
You wanna get me started

02:15.677 --> 02:17.095
on your tinted
facial moisturizer?

02:17.137 --> 02:18.012
Hey, I have never used

02:18.054 --> 02:19.597
tinted moisturizer, thank you.

02:19.639 --> 02:21.182
Own it.

02:21.224 --> 02:22.142
Premiere this Thursday,

02:22.183 --> 02:23.518
if you can find
something to wear.

02:23.560 --> 02:24.936
That goes
with your face bronzer?

02:24.978 --> 02:27.605
Check your texts
and find a new dress.

02:32.527 --> 02:34.445
- Go home, please.
- I'm fine.

02:34.487 --> 02:35.655
You're not fine.

02:35.697 --> 02:36.823
You've been on antibiotics,

02:36.865 --> 02:38.491
like, ten times
in the last three months.

02:38.533 --> 02:41.327
Try 11.

02:41.369 --> 02:42.453
Joyce Holt's office.

02:42.495 --> 02:44.497
Travis, it's me,
Meredith's assistant.

02:44.539 --> 02:45.540
Seriously, bitch?

02:45.582 --> 02:47.333
You finally decide
to call me back?

02:47.375 --> 02:49.794
- Have you heard the news?
- What?

02:49.836 --> 02:52.881
Meredith has decided
to give Joyce the books.

03:26.289 --> 03:29.709
I wanna fuck tonight.

03:29.751 --> 03:33.338
I don't think you heard me.

03:33.379 --> 03:35.465
I wanna put my dick inside you

03:35.506 --> 03:37.383
and fuck you
till you can't walk.

03:40.386 --> 03:42.639
You think that's funny?

03:42.680 --> 03:44.641
It's cute.

03:44.682 --> 03:47.685
I wasn't going for cute.

03:47.727 --> 03:50.605
I'd rather you give me
a foot rub.

03:50.647 --> 03:53.733
Tomorrow, when I'm ovulating.

03:54.275 --> 03:56.945
Knock, knock! Avon calling!

03:56.986 --> 03:57.946
You better cover up.

03:57.987 --> 04:00.323
You're gonna give the kid
a heart attack.

04:00.365 --> 04:03.368
Come in.

04:03.409 --> 04:07.330
Hi.
So I have good news.

04:09.540 --> 04:13.044
Meredith is backing out
of the Universal deal

04:13.086 --> 04:14.587
and going with us.

04:14.629 --> 04:15.672
We got the books.

04:15.713 --> 04:17.131
How?

04:17.173 --> 04:19.759
I found a way.

04:23.805 --> 04:26.766
It's a dark day
when my 24-year-old assistant

04:26.808 --> 04:30.770
is more successful than
my overpaid VP of production.

04:32.563 --> 04:35.608
We got Meredith's books.

04:35.650 --> 04:38.569
Correction.
We didn't get them.

04:38.611 --> 04:40.905
Travis did.

04:41.906 --> 04:44.325
It's so funny
how a British accent

04:44.367 --> 04:46.494
can be misleading.

04:46.536 --> 04:47.870
Makes one seem smart

04:47.912 --> 04:50.873
when in reality,
they're a fucking idiot.

04:57.672 --> 04:59.465
Double almond milk matcha.

04:59.507 --> 05:01.968
We won't be needing
you here anymore.

05:05.430 --> 05:07.056
You're firing me?

05:07.098 --> 05:09.684
Mm-hmm.

05:09.726 --> 05:10.977
Did Marty say
you could let me go?

05:11.019 --> 05:14.397
Marty doesn't manage interns.
I do.

05:14.439 --> 05:15.315
Joyce--

05:15.356 --> 05:17.692
Could give two fucks
about you.

05:20.028 --> 05:22.655
Take your braids

05:22.697 --> 05:24.532
and your weird little outfits

05:24.574 --> 05:26.993
and go back
to Colorado Springs.

05:28.703 --> 05:32.790
You're no longer needed.

05:50.850 --> 05:53.311
It's just so much
fucking pressure every time.

05:53.353 --> 05:57.273
I know.

05:57.315 --> 06:00.068
Just do what you gotta do.

06:01.319 --> 06:03.321
I feel like an asshole
every time I do that.

06:03.363 --> 06:04.489
I don't wanna do--
- Just do it.

06:04.530 --> 06:05.531
- No.
- I gotta be

06:05.573 --> 06:06.991
on a conference call
in 15 minutes.

06:07.033 --> 06:08.242
No, I'm not doing that. No.

06:08.284 --> 06:10.620
Sweetheart,
no is not an option.

06:16.751 --> 06:19.629
Every time.

06:22.423 --> 06:23.966
Oh, my God.

06:28.679 --> 06:30.765
Oh, my God.

06:33.267 --> 06:34.602
Oh, my God!

06:49.784 --> 06:52.578
Yeah. Yeah.
You like my fucking cock?

06:52.620 --> 06:56.249
- Yeah.
- You like my fucking cock?

06:56.290 --> 06:57.500
I'm fucking fine?
- Yeah.

07:12.014 --> 07:13.933
You did it.

07:23.401 --> 07:24.944
Oh, shit.

07:27.738 --> 07:28.948
Hello.

07:28.990 --> 07:31.409
Meredith Lockhart calling.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.077
Okay, put her through.

07:33.119 --> 07:35.288
Hey, Meredith,
you're on with Joyce.

07:35.329 --> 07:37.707
- Hey.
- I gotta hand it to you.

07:37.748 --> 07:40.376
You're more punk rock
than I thought.

07:40.418 --> 07:42.503
What can I say?

07:42.545 --> 07:44.630
I have
very tenacious assistants.

07:44.672 --> 07:45.715
I've trained them well.

07:45.756 --> 07:48.801
I'll say.
The new one's a beast.

07:48.843 --> 07:50.136
Oh, Travis?

07:50.178 --> 07:53.055
Nah, he isn't new.
He's been with me for a while.

07:53.097 --> 07:55.349
No, I'm talking
about the girl.

07:55.391 --> 07:59.479
I mean, most studios, they send
over an obligatory gift basket.

07:59.520 --> 08:02.064
But the smoking hot
22-year-old?

08:02.106 --> 08:03.149
Ha!

08:03.191 --> 08:05.568
That's a pretty audacious move
even for you.

08:05.610 --> 08:09.322
The whole pale skin,
braided art chick specificity.

08:09.363 --> 08:10.615
Oh, that was brilliant.

08:10.656 --> 08:13.326
It was like a character
out of one of my books.

08:29.133 --> 08:30.635
Where's the girl?

08:32.553 --> 08:35.473
The intern?

08:35.515 --> 08:36.724
She's gone.

08:36.766 --> 08:39.352
She got a job
at some production company.

08:39.393 --> 08:40.895
Quit yesterday.

08:40.937 --> 08:42.980
Get her back in her desk
by tomorrow,

08:43.022 --> 08:45.066
or you're dead to me.

08:49.278 --> 08:52.031
About fucking time.

09:20.685 --> 09:22.603
Hi.

09:26.524 --> 09:29.944
I came to apologize

09:29.986 --> 09:31.946
for how things went down.

09:35.116 --> 09:39.161
Look, I have jealousy issues.
Okay?

09:39.203 --> 09:41.080
Fucks up all my relationships.

09:41.122 --> 09:45.001
So... I want you to come back.

09:48.462 --> 09:51.507
You want me to come back?

09:51.549 --> 09:55.970
Or Joyce wants me to come back?

09:56.012 --> 10:00.224
We want you to come back.

10:02.727 --> 10:04.020
Let me think about it.

10:04.061 --> 10:07.648
Not an option.

10:07.690 --> 10:10.568
Please.

10:14.697 --> 10:16.699
What's in it for me?

10:21.454 --> 10:23.706
I came as soon as I heard.

10:25.249 --> 10:28.044
Thank you.

10:29.629 --> 10:32.590
Funny thing, life.

10:33.883 --> 10:37.678
First time I met you,

10:37.720 --> 10:41.474
you were
poor white gutter trash.

10:42.933 --> 10:46.896
Joyce Mueller Holt.

10:46.937 --> 10:51.150
From Gelsenkirchen.

10:51.192 --> 10:53.319
Now look at you.

10:57.907 --> 11:02.620
I have one last favor

11:02.662 --> 11:06.957
to ask you
before we close the paperwork.

11:15.132 --> 11:19.220
Come on,
don't deny a dirty old man

11:19.261 --> 11:20.930
his dying wish.

11:26.519 --> 11:29.772
I can always change my mind,
you know.

11:29.814 --> 11:31.899
How much are the keys
to the kingdom

11:31.941 --> 11:34.944
really worth to you?

11:34.985 --> 11:37.154
Come on.

11:37.196 --> 11:40.449
For old time's sake.

11:40.491 --> 11:42.368
Touch her.

11:52.128 --> 11:55.423
Not there.

11:55.464 --> 11:58.217
You know where.

12:25.035 --> 12:27.329
Oh, God.

12:28.330 --> 12:31.500
Give me your hand.

12:35.129 --> 12:37.339
Thank you.

12:39.884 --> 12:42.595
Ambrosia.

12:46.265 --> 12:48.476
You live,

12:48.517 --> 12:51.187
and then you die.

12:53.355 --> 12:55.941
But I'm not gonna die.

12:58.819 --> 13:00.613
I'm in remission.

13:02.698 --> 13:06.911
And you've been a naughty girl.

13:06.952 --> 13:09.079
I know all about your plan
to fund

13:09.121 --> 13:12.958
your big dreams of expansion.

13:13.000 --> 13:17.463
You're gonna sell off
49% of Fountain

13:17.505 --> 13:21.926
to private equity investors.

13:21.967 --> 13:24.845
You overplayed your hand,
little lady.

13:24.887 --> 13:28.390
I've sent your chink investors
hightailing it back

13:28.432 --> 13:30.893
to Bei-fucking-jing.

13:30.935 --> 13:35.231
The only question now is,

13:35.272 --> 13:37.483
what do I do with you?

13:41.529 --> 13:43.781
Clearly, I should fire you.

13:46.116 --> 13:47.868
But I think--

13:47.910 --> 13:51.789
I think
I'll just shorten your leash.

13:51.831 --> 13:54.416
Watch you strain
against your master.

13:58.003 --> 14:01.549
Here.

14:01.590 --> 14:05.344
Disinfect your finger.

14:05.386 --> 14:07.972
You never know
what's been in my mouth.

14:15.855 --> 14:20.150
Power is a dangerous,
delicate creature.

14:22.111 --> 14:25.739
Intoxicating,

14:25.781 --> 14:27.116
and fickle.

14:50.347 --> 14:51.724
Thank you.

14:59.189 --> 15:01.233
I see you found a new dress.

15:05.529 --> 15:08.157
This place belonged to Hearst.

15:08.198 --> 15:09.408
Supposedly, Jackie O and JFK

15:09.450 --> 15:11.827
spent their honeymoon
night here.

15:11.869 --> 15:13.120
Head just blew off.

15:13.162 --> 15:16.457
Stick with me, kid.
I don't fuck around.

15:16.498 --> 15:18.959
Champagne?

15:19.001 --> 15:20.502
Twist my arm.

15:32.097 --> 15:34.266
Vodka soda, please.

15:40.147 --> 15:42.650
Sorry.

15:42.691 --> 15:44.818
Such a filthy habit.

15:44.860 --> 15:48.197
You know, I've been trying
to quit since I was a teenager.

15:48.238 --> 15:50.532
We all have something.

15:54.453 --> 15:57.957
I know you. You sail.

15:57.998 --> 15:59.792
- I barely drive.
- No. No.

15:59.833 --> 16:01.377
I have a sailboat down
at the Marina.

16:01.418 --> 16:05.673
You came with us on one of our
Saturday evening booze cruises.

16:05.714 --> 16:07.508
Not me.

16:10.678 --> 16:12.221
Did you work on the movie?

16:12.262 --> 16:15.641
No. I just moved here.

16:15.683 --> 16:19.103
How do you like it so far?

16:19.144 --> 16:21.855
People are pretty hard-core.

16:21.897 --> 16:24.984
That's why I like sailing.
It's the epitome of soft-core.

16:35.077 --> 16:37.621
Text me

16:37.663 --> 16:41.875
if you want an old guy
to take you sailing.

16:41.917 --> 16:44.461
You're not so old.

16:44.503 --> 16:48.882
She says, making the old guy
feel that much older.

17:15.617 --> 17:17.161
Looks serious.

17:17.202 --> 17:19.371
Isn't it always with her?

17:20.330 --> 17:22.916
- Why are you sitting in here?
- Why are you not?

17:22.958 --> 17:26.879
How'd you score
VIP access, Colorado?

17:26.920 --> 17:28.964
I'm not sure I did.

17:29.006 --> 17:30.758
Can I help with anything?

17:30.799 --> 17:31.967
No, I'm good.

17:32.009 --> 17:34.303
All-nighter
damage control on deck.

17:34.344 --> 17:37.723
The movie's tracking awful.
Redmond is losing his shit.

17:39.308 --> 17:41.060
Here.

17:41.101 --> 17:43.312
You need it more than me.

17:43.353 --> 17:46.482
I can't.
I'm sober. Remember?

17:46.523 --> 17:49.526
I'm sorry.
I totally forgot.

17:49.568 --> 17:51.361
Mm-hmm.

17:51.403 --> 17:53.697
Well, feel better.

18:02.581 --> 18:04.750
I need a moment of joy.

18:04.792 --> 18:06.877
Chili cheese fries might be it.

18:06.919 --> 18:09.588
Hey, you could be running
any studio in town.

18:09.630 --> 18:12.174
Fuck Redmond.
Fuck him.

18:12.216 --> 18:14.927
I've been building this thing
for over a decade.

18:14.968 --> 18:18.430
I'm not quitting.

18:18.472 --> 18:22.643
I just need to wait it out.

18:22.684 --> 18:24.937
And it's gonna happen.

18:32.194 --> 18:36.490
Doctor said we're down
to one good embryo.

18:36.532 --> 18:40.369
If all goes well,
we implant on the 23rd.

18:40.410 --> 18:42.788
Okay.

18:42.830 --> 18:45.207
Can we get two
chili cheese fries?

18:45.916 --> 18:48.460
Hey, if it's our last shot,
don't you think we should wait?

18:48.502 --> 18:50.712
I mean, you're
so stressed out right now--

18:50.754 --> 18:52.881
I'm not stressed. I'm fine.

18:55.217 --> 18:57.469
Hey.

18:57.511 --> 18:59.930
We can adopt
if it doesn't work.

18:59.972 --> 19:01.473
It will.

19:06.937 --> 19:09.148
It will.

19:14.236 --> 19:16.530
Her timing is impeccable.

19:20.993 --> 19:23.871
What's she like?

19:23.912 --> 19:25.455
She's complicated.

19:25.497 --> 19:28.917
Is she as impenetrable
as she seems?

19:30.502 --> 19:32.671
Yeah.

19:32.713 --> 19:35.841
Yeah.
I should have quit years ago.

19:35.883 --> 19:37.509
Why do you stay?

19:37.551 --> 19:39.928
My therapist says
I like the abuse.

19:41.138 --> 19:43.515
I just wanna do something
beyond dog walking

19:43.557 --> 19:46.560
and lunch orders.

19:46.602 --> 19:48.979
I think I can help with that.

19:49.021 --> 19:51.732
You've done enough already.

19:53.692 --> 19:57.196
What do I get out of this
if I did help you?

20:02.534 --> 20:05.204
You know we can't.

20:05.245 --> 20:08.415
We're brother and sister.

20:08.457 --> 20:12.628
That would just be weird.

20:12.669 --> 20:16.048
We're not even allowed
to hug co-workers anymore,

20:16.089 --> 20:19.426
let alone...

20:19.468 --> 20:22.429
I'm really good
at keeping secrets.

20:26.850 --> 20:29.102
Pinky promise.

20:32.105 --> 20:35.317
All right. Okay.

20:35.359 --> 20:37.027
Pinky promise.

21:03.262 --> 21:05.472
You got your fucking candle.

21:12.938 --> 21:14.231
You just lost me

21:14.273 --> 21:16.441
a fuck-ton of money,
little lady.

21:16.483 --> 21:19.987
You better figure out
how you're gonna make it back.

21:27.452 --> 21:31.331
Die already,
you disgusting piece of shit.

21:49.683 --> 21:53.061
Alex! Hand cream!

21:55.522 --> 21:57.941
He's not answering his cell.

22:06.033 --> 22:09.619
- How'd you find this?
- I have my ways.

22:12.205 --> 22:15.709
Find him. Get him in here. Now.

22:44.946 --> 22:48.700
Alex?

22:52.871 --> 22:54.706
Hi, pretty girl.
