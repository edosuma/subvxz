09:22.790 --> 09:23.859
MAYBE SHE WORKS HERE.

09:23.890 --> 09:25.027
(Gus)
THAT WOULDN'T SURPRISE ME.

09:25.060 --> 09:26.152
SHE'S HAD, LIKE,
A THOUSAND JOBS.

09:26.190 --> 09:27.896
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH THAT.

09:27.930 --> 09:31.058
AND SHE DOESN'T JUST WORK HERE.
THE WINE IS NAMED MIRA.

09:31.100 --> 09:33.694
MAYBE THEY NAME A WINE
AI-TER ALL THEIR EMPLOYEES.

09:33.740 --> 09:35.890
REMIND ME TO GRAB A BOTTLE
OF LEONARD ON THE WAY OUT.

09:35.940 --> 09:37.999
(Mira)
BURTON GUSTER?

09:40.910 --> 09:44.073
[heartbeat]

09:44.110 --> 09:46.305
(Shawn)
GUS.

09:46.350 --> 09:48.875
GUS.

09:48.920 --> 09:49.944
GUS!

09:49.990 --> 09:52.140
WHAT DO I SAY?
HOW'S MY BREATH?

09:52.190 --> 09:53.282
RELAX.
REMEMBER THE PLAN.

09:53.320 --> 09:54.810
WHAT PLAN?

09:54.860 --> 09:55.815
I FORGOT THE PLAN.

09:55.860 --> 09:57.987
[giggles excitedly]

10:00.400 --> 10:01.651
HOW ARE YOU?

10:01.700 --> 10:03.019
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU IN WHAT?
TEN YEARS?

10:03.070 --> 10:06.119
AND NOW LOOK, BOOM,
HERE YOU ARE.

10:06.170 --> 10:08.730
HI, I'M SHAWN.

10:08.770 --> 10:09.964
HI.

10:10.010 --> 10:12.638
I, UH, I GAVE HIM
A REALLY TOUGH RIDDLE

10:12.680 --> 10:13.476
ON THE WAY OVER,

10:13.510 --> 10:14.909
SO HE'S PROBABLY NOW
JUST FIGURING OUT

10:14.940 --> 10:17.841
THAT THE DOCTOR
WAS A WOMAN.

10:17.880 --> 10:18.847
[giggIeSJ
NO, NO.

10:18.880 --> 10:19.847
HE'S DONE THIS BEFORE.

10:19.880 --> 10:21.871
HE DID THIS
WHEN WE FIRST MET.

10:21.920 --> 10:22.989
I THINK IT'S KINDA CUTE
ACTUALLY.

10:23.020 --> 10:24.817
IF WE JUST KEEP TALKING,
HE'LL CATCH UP.

10:24.850 --> 10:27.717
SO I HEAR THAT YOU GUYS HAVE
A DETECTIVE AGENCY OR SOMETHING.

10:27.760 --> 10:28.852
MIRA!

10:28.890 --> 10:29.925
MIRA!

10:29.960 --> 10:31.154
UH, HI.

10:31.190 --> 10:33.158
HI THERE.
WELCOME.

10:33.200 --> 10:35.350
WOW.
YOU LOOK AMAZING.

10:35.400 --> 10:36.697
NO, YOU DO.

10:36.730 --> 10:37.992
NO, YOU REALLY
LOOK AMAZING.

10:38.030 --> 10:38.724
NO, YOU DO.

10:38.770 --> 10:40.795
A LITTLE BIT, BUT,
I MEAN, WOW!

10:40.840 --> 10:41.738
THE ONLY THING
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER WAS

10:41.770 --> 10:42.862
IF YOU HAD WORN ONE
OF THOSE SWEATER VESTS.

10:42.910 --> 10:45.663
I LOVE IT--DO YOU STILL WEAR
THOSE SWEATER VESTS?

10:45.710 --> 10:46.836
[Gus laughing]

10:46.880 --> 10:48.973
GUS, I REMEMBER THE PLAN.
THIS ISN'T IT.

10:49.010 --> 10:50.841
OH, I KNOW.
LET'S CELEBRATE WITH A DRINK.

10:50.880 --> 10:52.074
OKAY?

10:52.110 --> 10:53.418
BUT NOT GOLDSCHLAGER, RIGHT?

10:53.450 --> 10:54.417
[laughs]

10:54.450 --> 10:55.439
I'M IN TROUBLE.

10:55.480 --> 10:56.811
ALL RIGHT, JUST BE COOL.

10:56.850 --> 10:58.784
AND MAKE YOUR ARM PITS
STOP SWEATING.

10:58.820 --> 11:02.722
OKAY, SO THIS IS OUR SANGIOVESE
FROM LAST YEAR.

11:02.760 --> 11:04.978
[laughter]

11:05.030 --> 11:06.054
GOLDSCHLAGER!

11:06.090 --> 11:07.455
[laughs]

11:07.500 --> 11:09.195
GUS.

11:09.230 --> 11:11.118
SO HOW LONG
HAVE YOU BEEN WORKING HERE?

11:11.170 --> 11:13.764
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.
THIS IS MY FAMILY'S PLACE.

11:13.800 --> 11:14.994
WE HAVE
THREE WINERIES.

11:15.040 --> 11:16.268
THIS ONE,
A NEW ONE IN NAPA,

11:16.300 --> 11:17.938
AND THEN THERE'S THE ONE
IN SPAIN, WHICH OF COURSE

11:17.970 --> 11:20.279
I CAN'T GO TO BECAUSE I PUNCHED
THE BULL IN PAMPLONA.

11:20.310 --> 11:21.971
SO, MIRA, UH,

11:22.010 --> 11:24.478
WHAT MADE YOU WANNA SEE ME
AI-TER ALL THIS TIME?

11:24.510 --> 11:28.446
WELL, UM,
I KINDA HAVE SOME BIG NEWS.

11:28.480 --> 11:31.119
IS IT GUS JUNIOR?

11:31.150 --> 11:32.117
WHAT?

11:32.150 --> 11:34.311
NOTHING.

11:34.360 --> 11:35.952
I'M GETTING MARRIED.

11:35.990 --> 11:36.922
OH.

11:36.960 --> 11:38.757
OH.
YEAH, YEAH.

11:38.790 --> 11:41.156
HIS NAME IS JANN,
AND HE'S FROM SWEDEN.

11:41.200 --> 11:42.929
ALTHOUGH HE'S LIVED
ALL OVER THE WORLD.

11:42.970 --> 11:46.167
AND I MET HIM AT THIS WINE
CONVENTION A FEW MONTHS AGO.

11:46.200 --> 11:47.838
MIRA, THAT'S AWESOME.
CONGRATULATIONS.

11:47.870 --> 11:48.837
THAN KS.

11:48.870 --> 11:51.338
SO THE THING IS, GUS,

11:51.370 --> 11:54.100
THAT, UH, OUR WEDDING CHAPEL
IN MAZATLAN,

11:54.140 --> 11:56.005
THEY ACTUALLY SENT
THE MARRIAGE LICENSE

11:56.040 --> 11:57.405
TO THE U.S.,
SO THE ANNULMENT ISN'T OFFICIAL.

11:57.450 --> 11:58.439
SO I KINDA JUST NEED YOU

11:58.480 --> 11:59.469
TO FILL OUT SOME PAPERWORK.

11:59.510 --> 12:00.977
IS THAT COOL?

12:01.020 --> 12:02.112
YES.
OH, SURE.

12:02.150 --> 12:03.117
YES.
OKAY, SURE.

12:03.150 --> 12:04.048
OH, GOOD.
GOOD.

12:04.090 --> 12:07.457
I WAS A LITTLE WORRIED.

12:07.490 --> 12:08.752
SO WHEN IS THE BIG DAY?

12:08.790 --> 12:10.985
IT'S ACTUALLY TOMORROW.

12:11.030 --> 12:12.122
ON LEDBETTER BEACH.

12:12.160 --> 12:13.320
IT'S JUST GONNA BE
A SMALL THING.

12:13.360 --> 12:15.248
I KINDA WANTED IT TO BE HERE,
BUT HE WANTED AT A BEACH.

12:15.300 --> 12:16.449
I THOUGHT, IT'S REALLY THE ONLY
THING HE REALLY WANTS,

12:16.500 --> 12:18.058
SO I THINK I'LL LET HIM DO IT.

12:18.100 --> 12:20.193
IT'S KINDA ROMANTIC.
AND--OH, DAD!

12:20.240 --> 12:21.832
(David)
YEAH?

12:21.870 --> 12:24.236
DAD, THIS IS SHAWN.

12:24.270 --> 12:25.828
IT'S SHAWN, RIGHT?
YEAH, SHAWN.

12:25.870 --> 12:28.077
AND THIS IS GUS.

12:28.110 --> 12:30.499
AH, AH, YES, GUSTER.

12:30.550 --> 12:31.505
SO THIS IS THE YOUNG MAN
THAT TRICKED YOU

12:31.550 --> 12:33.177
INTO MARRYING HIM, HUH?
Y-YEAH.

12:33.220 --> 12:35.040
TYPICAL.

12:35.080 --> 12:36.377
MIRA, I NEED
TO SPEAK TO YOU.

12:36.420 --> 12:37.444
OKAY.
GENTLEM EN.

12:37.490 --> 12:39.481
ONLY THE FIRST GLASS IS FREE.

12:42.060 --> 12:43.254
OH, OH!

12:43.290 --> 12:44.257
WHY DON'T YOU COME
TO THE WEDDING?

12:44.290 --> 12:45.359
OH, MIRA.

12:45.390 --> 12:47.096
PLEASE, PLEASE,
PLEASE, PLEASE!

12:47.130 --> 12:51.066
COME, COME,
COME, COME, COME, COME!

12:51.100 --> 12:52.089
THAT'S VERY SWEET OF YOU,
BUT WE'RE A LITTLE TIGHT--

12:52.130 --> 12:54.098
WHAT TIME
SHOULD VG/ILEJSBE THERE?

12:54.140 --> 12:55.391
SHAWN,
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

12:55.440 --> 12:57.169
MIRA, OF COURSE
WE WILL COME.

12:57.210 --> 12:58.268
OKAY, GOOD.

12:58.310 --> 12:59.208
SO I'M GONNA GO GET

12:59.240 --> 13:00.935
THE WEDDING INFO
AND THE ANNULMENT PAPERS.

13:00.980 --> 13:03.448
OH, I HOPE I DON'T EVER SAY
THAT SENTENCE AGAIN.

13:03.480 --> 13:05.107
[Mira giggling]

13:05.150 --> 13:06.344
DUDE.

13:06.380 --> 13:08.848
SHE JUST SMELLED SO NICE.

13:08.880 --> 13:11.110
DON'T JUDGE ME, SHAWN.
I'M WEAK.

13:13.260 --> 13:15.012
(Gus)
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE LATE.

13:15.060 --> 13:17.119
LOOK, I'M NOT THE ONE THAT SPENT
TWO HOURS PICKING OUT

13:17.160 --> 13:19.082
THE PERFECT
SHIRT-TIE-EYES COMBO.

13:19.130 --> 13:20.199
FINALLY,

13:20.230 --> 13:22.050
WHAT THE HELL
AM I DOING HERE?

13:22.100 --> 13:24.068
SHAWN, YOU CANCELLED TWICE.
YOU'RE LATE.

13:24.100 --> 13:24.919
I'M HUNGRY.

13:24.970 --> 13:26.323
LOOK, WE'RE GONNA EAT LUNCH.
I PROMISE.

13:26.370 --> 13:28.099
THERE MAY EVEN BE
A GRILLED CHEESE BAR

13:28.140 --> 13:30.108
AND SOME DANCING INVOLVED.
WHAT, AT THE CRAB SHACK?

13:30.140 --> 13:31.209
CHANGE OF PLANS.
WE'RE GOING TO A WEDDING.

13:31.240 --> 13:33.470
I CAN'T GO TO A WEDDING.
I'M NOT DRESSED FOR A WEDDING.

13:33.510 --> 13:34.579
DAD, YOU LOOK SHARP AS A TACK.

13:34.610 --> 13:36.077
NO ONE WILL EVEN NOTICE.

13:36.110 --> 13:37.145
SHAWN.
SH--

13:41.450 --> 13:44.089

IS HE WITH YOU?

13:50.030 --> 13:51.850
OH, YEAH, HE'S FINE.
I JUST WON HIM IN A BET.

13:51.890 --> 13:53.198
OH!

13:53.230 --> 13:55.198
[giggIeSJ
I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

13:55.230 --> 13:57.198

YOU'RE GUS.

13:57.230 --> 13:58.959
GUS!

13:59.000 --> 14:00.433
WE'VE BEEN WAITING

14:00.470 --> 14:02.461
MIRA SAID WE COULDN'T START
UNTIL YOU GOT HERE.

14:02.500 --> 14:04.365
AI-TER ALL, YOU ARE
A VERY SPECIAL GUEST.

14:04.410 --> 14:06.037
I AM?

14:06.070 --> 14:09.130
OH, DON'T BE NERVOUS, YOU.
YOU'LL DO GREAT.

14:09.180 --> 14:10.499

14:21.260 --> 14:23.353
[string quartet begins playing]

14:23.390 --> 14:28.953
*

14:29.000 --> 14:31.321
OH, MY GOD.

14:31.370 --> 14:32.962
THIS IS MY WEDDING.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.297
GUS, THAT'S CRAZY.
NO, IT'S NOT.

14:34.340 --> 14:35.659
IT'S MIRA.

14:35.700 --> 14:38.464
IT'S JUST LIKE HER TO TRY
TO PULL SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

14:38.510 --> 14:39.465
YOU GOTTA GET ME
OUTTA HERE.

14:39.510 --> 14:41.478
OKAY, RELAX.

14:41.510 --> 14:43.239
I CAN HAVE YOU IN MEXICO
IN FOUR HOURS.

14:43.280 --> 14:44.372
BUT WE GOTTA DYE YOUR HAIR,
CHANGE YOUR NAME,

14:44.410 --> 14:45.900
CUT OFF YOUR FINGERTIPS
SO YOU CAN'T BE IDENTIFIED.

14:45.950 --> 14:48.168
I DON'T NEED FINGERTIPS.

14:48.220 --> 14:48.970
EXCUSE ME, EVERYONE.

14:49.020 --> 14:52.012
I'M AFRAID
WE HAVE HORRIBLE NEWS.

14:52.050 --> 14:54.280
IT SEEMS JANN IS MISSING.

14:54.320 --> 14:55.059
YES!
WHOO!

14:55.090 --> 14:56.978
(Gus)
OH, THAT WAS CLOSE!

14:57.030 --> 14:58.054
SWEET!

15:02.660 --> 15:05.128
[Mira sobbing]

15:05.170 --> 15:06.592
SWEETIE PIE.

15:06.630 --> 15:07.597
IT'S...

15:07.640 --> 15:09.596
NO, I DON'T WANT THE WATER.

15:09.640 --> 15:12.131
BABY, IT'S BEEN TWO HOURS.

15:12.170 --> 15:14.138
I DON'T THINK
HE'S COMING.

15:14.180 --> 15:14.976
OF COURSE
HE'S NOT COMING.

15:15.010 --> 15:16.432
HE DIDN'T SHOW UP WEDNESDAY
FOR GOLF,

15:16.480 --> 15:18.038
THURSDAY FOR THE BARBEQUE,

15:18.080 --> 15:18.978
YESTERDAY
FOR THE REHEARSAL DINNER.

15:19.010 --> 15:21.149
WHY WOULD HE SHOW UP
TO HIS OWN WEDDING?

15:21.180 --> 15:22.943
NO, DAD, YOU KNOW
THAT HE GOT CALLED TO WORK

15:22.990 --> 15:24.048
ON THOSE OTHER THINGS.

15:24.090 --> 15:26.046
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU TALKED ME INTO THIS.

15:26.090 --> 15:27.580
(Phyllis)
BABY, CAN WE AT LEAST LET
THE PEOPLE EAT SOMETHING?

15:27.620 --> 15:28.985
NO.

15:29.020 --> 15:32.126
NOBODY GETS TO EAT
UNTIL I'M MARRIED!

15:37.200 --> 15:39.168
THAT'S IT, SHAWN.
I'M OUTTA HERE.

15:39.200 --> 15:43.034
IT'S RUDE TO INVITE PEOPLE
TO AN EVENT AND NOT FEED 'EM.

15:43.070 --> 15:44.503
(Mira)
SOMEBODY FIX IT!

15:44.540 --> 15:47.134
LOOK AT HER IN THAT DRESS.

15:47.180 --> 15:48.238
SHE'S SO BEAUTIFUL.

15:48.280 --> 15:49.736
[crying]

15:49.780 --> 15:52.499
DUDE, I GOTTA GET YOU
OUTTA HERE.

15:52.550 --> 15:55.075
THIS MUST BE HOW SHE FELT
AFTER I ANNULLED OUR WEDDING.

15:55.120 --> 15:56.576
I FEEL SO BAD FOR HER.

15:56.620 --> 15:58.178
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
COME ON, LET'S HIT IT.

16:00.490 --> 16:01.457
WHAT?

16:01.490 --> 16:03.287
MIRA.
YEAH?

16:03.330 --> 16:05.150
I AM SO SORRY
TO HEAR ABOUT JANN.

16:05.190 --> 16:06.418
WE'LL HELP YOU FIND HIM.

16:06.460 --> 16:08.291
YOU WILL?
WE WILL?

16:08.330 --> 16:09.695
YES, WE DON'T HAVE ANY CASES
RIGHT NOW.

16:09.730 --> 16:11.061
WE'RE MORE
THAN HAPPY TO HELP.

16:11.100 --> 16:15.366
OH, GUSTER!
THANK YOU.

16:15.400 --> 16:17.402
JUST FINISHED MY CASE REPORTS

O'HARA, I DO HOPE
YOU'RE NOT FALLING BEHIND

16:23.610 --> 16:24.679
ON YOUR PAPERWORK.

16:24.710 --> 16:27.417
THOSE REPORTS
LOOK GREAT, O'HARA.

16:27.450 --> 16:30.180
LISTEN, CAN YOU TRANSLATE
THESE FILES INTO SPANISH?

16:30.220 --> 16:31.744
NO PROBLEMA.

16:31.790 --> 16:33.109
YOU SPEAK SPANISH?

16:33.160 --> 16:35.549
IT'S A REQUIREMENT
IN MIAMI.

16:35.590 --> 16:37.387
WELL, THERE'S NOT THAT
VERY LARGE A LATINO POPULATION

16:37.430 --> 16:38.488
HERE IN SANTA BARBARA.

16:44.100 --> 16:45.658

THAT'S SO HOT!
MATT!

16:47.740 --> 16:49.196
DID YOU JUST BREW THIS?

16:53.510 --> 16:55.137
IT'S NOT TOO HOT FOR ME.

16:55.180 --> 16:57.205
PLEASE TELL ME YOU DIDN'T JUST
BURN YOUR MOUTH

16:57.250 --> 16:58.706
BECAUSE YOU'RE STILL PISSED
I SCORED HIGHER THAN YOU

16:58.750 --> 17:00.069
ON THAT STUPID EXAM?

17:00.120 --> 17:01.314
NO.

17:01.350 --> 17:02.817
UGH.

17:02.850 --> 17:04.078
HEY, DETECTIVE O'HARA!

17:04.120 --> 17:05.644
YOUR STOLEN REFRIGERATION TRUCK

17:05.690 --> 17:07.248
FROM THE SEAFOOD WAREHOUSE,

17:07.290 --> 17:08.814
THAT'S A 10-8-51, RIGHT?
YES.

17:08.860 --> 17:10.157
NO, HOLD ON.

17:10.190 --> 17:11.157
THAT TRUCK IS
A COMMERCIAL VEHICLE,

17:11.190 --> 17:13.226
SO TECH NICALLY
IT'S A 15-250.

17:13.260 --> 17:14.227
EXCUSE ME, DETECTIVE.

17:14.260 --> 17:16.421
HE WAS ASKING ME.

17:16.460 --> 17:17.688
NOW, IF THAT VEHICLE ENDS UP

17:17.730 --> 17:19.266
IN A CHOP SHOP,

17:19.300 --> 17:20.528
IT'S A 10-8-03.

17:20.570 --> 17:21.559
OF COURSE IF THERE'S
RECKLESS DRIVING INVOLVED,

17:21.600 --> 17:22.828
IT'S A 23-00-1.

17:22.870 --> 17:24.201
AND WATCH OUT
FOR THE ILLEGAL TRANSPORTATION

17:24.240 --> 17:25.207
OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS.

17:25.240 --> 17:27.731
25-00-1.

17:27.780 --> 17:29.372
OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH.

17:29.410 --> 17:32.174
I GOTTA GO GET
SOME PAPER ANYWAY.

17:32.210 --> 17:33.177
YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:33.220 --> 17:34.175
WHAT?

17:34.220 --> 17:35.710
I HAVE WORKED HARD.

17:35.750 --> 17:37.217
I HAVE DONE
EVERYTHING ASKED OF ME.

17:37.250 --> 17:38.342
I AM A GOOD COP,

17:38.390 --> 17:39.516
AND I'M NOT GOING
TO STAND HERE

17:39.550 --> 17:41.450
AND APOLOGIZE
FOR MY GOOD SCORE.

17:41.490 --> 17:43.287
SO YOU ARE JUST GONNA HAVE
TO GET OVER IT.

17:43.330 --> 17:44.285
YEAH.
I CAN'T DO THAT.

17:44.330 --> 17:45.456
WELL, THEN NOW WHAT?

17:45.490 --> 17:46.787
YOUR TRUCK.

17:46.830 --> 17:48.491
WHOEVER SOLVES THAT CASE
IS THE BETTER DETECTIVE.

17:48.530 --> 17:50.691
SOLVE YOUR OWN CASES.
IT'S A REFRIGERATION TRUCK.

17:50.730 --> 17:52.391
IT'S PRACTICALLY
A VICTIMLESS CRIME.

17:52.430 --> 17:54.398
WELL, I GUESS
YOU JUST DON'T COUNT THE PEOPLE

17:54.440 --> 17:55.532
WHO AREN'T GONNA GET
THEIR LOBSTER AND SAND DABS

17:55.570 --> 17:57.128
AS VICTIMS.

17:57.170 --> 17:58.467
I'M SURPRISED THE MIAMI P.D.
DIDN'T FAIL YOU

17:58.510 --> 18:00.671
FOR LACK OF COMPASSION.

18:00.710 --> 18:02.177
[groans]

18:02.210 --> 18:04.440
GUS, WHAT'S WRONG
WITH ME?

18:04.480 --> 18:08.849
WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES
ALL THE GUYS GO CRAZY ON ME?

18:08.880 --> 18:11.849
JANN WAS AN IDIOT
FOR GIVING YOU UP.

18:11.890 --> 18:13.653
YOU'RE SO SWEET.

18:13.690 --> 18:15.851
SWEET.

18:15.890 --> 18:19.849
SWEET GUS.

18:19.890 --> 18:21.824
YEAH, HE'S PRETTY SWEET
ALL RIGHT.

18:21.860 --> 18:24.795
HIS HEAD IS LIKE
A CHOCOLATE-COVERED HONEYDEW.

18:24.830 --> 18:27.731
NOW, WOULD ANYONE LIKE
TO TALK ABOUT "JAN?"

18:27.770 --> 18:29.362
(Gus)
IT'S JANN, WITH A "."J

18:29.400 --> 18:30.867
SHAWN IS RIGHT.
WE SHOULD DO THAT.

18:30.910 --> 18:34.676
SO THIS IS
ALL THAT I HAVE.

18:34.710 --> 18:37.474
I HAVE SOME PICTURES
OF US TOGETHER.

18:37.510 --> 18:39.171
AND A NOTE THAT HE WROTE ME.

18:39.210 --> 18:40.245
AND A LIPSTICK FROM HIM.

18:49.620 --> 18:51.588
DO YOU HAVE
ANY MORE PICTURES?

18:51.630 --> 18:53.325
NO.

18:56.930 --> 18:58.921
SHAWN.

18:58.970 --> 19:00.790
SHOULDN'T YOU MAYBE GO TALK
WITH MIRA'S PARENTS?

19:00.840 --> 19:01.829
I'LL FIND YOU
WHEN WE'RE FINISHED.

19:01.870 --> 19:02.837
I HAVEN'T FINISHED MY--

19:02.870 --> 19:04.269
IT'S FINE.
I'LL FINISH IT.

19:04.310 --> 19:07.302
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW TO WORK WITH CORK!

19:20.990 --> 19:21.957
MRS. GAFFNEY.

19:21.990 --> 19:23.821
HELLO.

19:23.860 --> 19:25.179
MY NAME IS SHAWN SPENCER.

19:25.230 --> 19:27.289
OH, I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

19:27.330 --> 19:30.299
YOU'RE THE PSYCHIC DETECTIVE
HELPING MIRA.

19:30.330 --> 19:31.968
YOU KNOW,

19:32.000 --> 19:34.639
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN FASCINATED
BY PEOPLE WITH "THE GIFT."

19:34.670 --> 19:35.830
UH, YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT THIS?

19:35.870 --> 19:36.837
WELL, THAT TAKES WORK.

19:36.870 --> 19:39.202
I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU
A QUESTION ABOUT "JAN."

19:39.240 --> 19:41.208
JANN?

19:41.240 --> 19:43.344
I WOULDN'T KNOW
THE FIRST THING ABOUT HIM.

19:43.380 --> 19:44.745
I SEE.

19:44.780 --> 19:46.668
BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T MET HIM?

19:46.710 --> 19:48.849
VERY GOOD.

19:48.880 --> 19:51.348
THIS IS OUR PRIVATE WINE

19:51.390 --> 19:52.948
AND ALCOHOL COLLECTION.

19:52.990 --> 19:54.355
OH, I SEE.

19:54.390 --> 19:55.209
I HAVE A PRIVATE ROOM

19:55.260 --> 19:56.955
FOR ALL
OF MY HELLO KITTY SHOT GLASSES

19:56.990 --> 19:58.389
AND WILD ANIMAL SCAT.

19:58.430 --> 20:00.421
I HAVE MANY INTERESTS.

20:00.460 --> 20:03.588
WELL, ONLY A PRIVILEGED FEW
ARE ALLOWED DOWN HERE.

20:03.630 --> 20:05.928
THE WINE IN THIS ROOM
IS WORTH OVER $1 MILLION.

20:05.970 --> 20:06.994
WE'VE BEEN COLLECTING IT

20:07.030 --> 20:08.634
FOR YEARS
FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD.

20:08.670 --> 20:11.002
WOULD YOU LIKE A GLASS?

20:11.040 --> 20:13.929
ACTUALLY, I PREFER
MY WINE IN A BOX.

20:13.980 --> 20:16.437
[laughs]

20:16.480 --> 20:17.572
WOW.

20:22.280 --> 20:23.281
I'VE OI-TEN HEARD

20:23.320 --> 20:24.446
THAT'S THE BEST WAY
TO SAVOR WINE.

20:24.490 --> 20:27.687
JUST SKIP OVER THE TASTE BUDS
AND GO RIGHT TO THE GULLET.

20:27.720 --> 20:30.359
I SWEAR, IF I HAVE TO DEAL
WITH ANOTHER TOURIST TODAY,

20:30.390 --> 20:31.857
MY HEAD IS GOING TO EXPLODE.

20:31.890 --> 20:33.426
AND DAVID DOESN'T LIKE
ME DRINKING

20:33.460 --> 20:34.620
IN FRONT OF THE GUESTS.

20:34.660 --> 20:37.299
SO, UH, HOW DID YOU MANAGE

20:37.330 --> 20:38.866
TO NEVER MEET JAN?

20:38.900 --> 20:40.993
WE TRIED TO.
SEVERAL TIMES.

20:41.040 --> 20:45.306
TAKE A SIP
BEFORE I FINISH THE BOTTLE.

20:45.340 --> 20:48.400
THAT'S--
THAT'S DISGUSTING.

20:48.440 --> 20:50.476
THAT'S A $30,000 BOTTLE
OF SPANISH SHERRY.

20:57.520 --> 20:58.987
MM.

20:59.020 --> 20:59.987
IT'S GOOD.

21:00.020 --> 21:02.386
YOU KNOW, SHAWN,

21:02.420 --> 21:07.448
I HAVE VERY FINE TASTE,
AND I LIKE MY WINE

21:07.500 --> 21:10.492
LIKE I LIKE MY MEN...

21:10.530 --> 21:14.398
WHITE AND HAIRY.

21:14.440 --> 21:15.839
THAT DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE.

21:15.870 --> 21:17.838
NONE WHATSOEVER.

21:17.870 --> 21:20.634
BUT I CAN SEE
WHERE MIRA GETS HER SPUNKINESS.

21:20.680 --> 21:22.079
[laughter]

21:22.110 --> 21:23.304
PHYLLIS,

21:23.350 --> 21:24.772
SOME OF OUR GUESTS ARE GONNA--

21:24.810 --> 21:26.698
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

21:26.750 --> 21:28.047
I WAS JUST EXPLAINING
OUR FRUSTRATION

21:28.080 --> 21:29.445
OVER NEVER MEETING JANN.

21:29.480 --> 21:31.516
OH.
YEAH, THAT GUY.

21:31.550 --> 21:33.882
YEAH, EVERY TIME WE MADE PLANS,

21:33.920 --> 21:35.080
HE WOULD CHANGE THEM
AT THE LAST SECOND

21:35.120 --> 21:38.624
WITH THAT SAME LAME EXCUSE
ABOUT HAVING TO WORK OVERSEAS.

21:38.660 --> 21:41.959
I CANNOT BELIEVE
THAT I SHUT DOWN MY WINERY

21:42.000 --> 21:43.968
FOR THIS WEDDING.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.467
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER.

21:48.440 --> 21:52.536
MIRA'S CHOICES IN MEN
HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SUSPECT.

21:52.570 --> 21:54.606
INCLUDING THAT GUSTER.

21:54.640 --> 21:57.871
AND HIS SUPPOSEDLY
PSYCHIC FRIEND.

21:57.910 --> 21:59.468
NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE US?

21:59.510 --> 22:01.842
YES, OF COURSE.

22:01.880 --> 22:03.848
YOU HAVE
TO FINISH PACKING YOUR WINE.

22:03.890 --> 22:06.848
YOU'RE MOVING INTO YOUR WINERY
IN NAPA ON FRIDAY,

22:06.890 --> 22:08.710
AND YOUR AMAZING COLLECTION
WILL FINALLY BE ON DISPLAY

22:08.760 --> 22:09.715
FOR ALL TO SEE.

22:09.760 --> 22:11.455
HEY, HOW'D YOU KNOW THAT--

22:11.490 --> 22:13.629
DON'T BE INTIMIDATED, SIR.

22:13.660 --> 22:14.922
I'M JUST A MAN.

22:20.740 --> 22:23.402
OH, GOD.
OH.

22:23.440 --> 22:24.600
(Shawn)
BRACE YOURSELF,

22:24.640 --> 22:26.528
JAN DOESN'T
ACTUALLY EXIST.

22:26.570 --> 22:27.673
WHAT?

22:27.710 --> 22:29.598
FACT, THERE IS NO RECORD
OF A JAN ANGLUND,

22:29.640 --> 22:31.699
BUYER OF FINE WINES AND FOOD
ON THE INTERNET ANYWHERE.

22:31.750 --> 22:33.547
I DID FIND A JEFF ANGLUND.

22:33.580 --> 22:36.708
HE'S AN ALBINO WITH A WEBSITE
DEDICATED TO SHORT CIRCUIT.

22:36.750 --> 22:38.149
YOU PUT US
ON THE EMAIL LIST?

22:38.190 --> 22:39.487
THAT'S A GIVEN.

22:39.520 --> 22:40.487
NICE.

22:40.520 --> 22:42.112
OH, SO SHE WAS LYING?

22:42.160 --> 22:44.788
OR SHE REALLY IS CHECKING
INTO THE NUTCRACKER SUITE.

22:44.830 --> 22:48.425
HEAR ME, MIRA MADE JAN UP.

22:48.460 --> 22:51.167
SHE MADE HIM UP?

22:51.200 --> 22:54.431
WHAT IS...

22:54.470 --> 22:55.459
CLOZAPINE?

22:55.500 --> 22:57.559
IT'S AN ANTI-ANXIETY DRUG.

22:57.610 --> 22:59.430
IT'S ALSO USED
TO TREAT PSYCHOSIS.

22:59.470 --> 23:00.607
BINGO.

23:00.640 --> 23:01.902
MIRA HAD A PRESCRIPTION
TO CLOZAPINE,

23:01.940 --> 23:03.476
BUT THE REFILL DATE WAS
FROM WAY BACK WHEN,

23:03.510 --> 23:05.171
AND SHE HAD A BUNCH
OF PILLS LEI-T.

23:05.210 --> 23:06.279
SO SHE WAS OFF HER MEDS.

23:06.310 --> 23:08.813
AND OFF HER ROCKER.
EVEN MORE SO THAN HER MOTHER.

23:08.850 --> 23:10.408
WHAT?

23:10.450 --> 23:11.986
LET'S JUST SAY I KNOW WHERE MIRA
GETS HER FREAKY SIDE.

23:12.020 --> 23:13.612
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

23:13.660 --> 23:16.811
I WAS FEELING BAD FOR MIRA.
I EVEN STARTED TO--

23:16.860 --> 23:19.624
OH, MY GOSH!

23:19.660 --> 23:21.799
SHAWN, SHE DID ALL THIS
TO GET ME BACK.

23:21.830 --> 23:22.819
I FELL FOR IT AGAIN.

23:22.860 --> 23:25.499
BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE.

23:25.530 --> 23:26.724
THE PICTURES.

23:33.680 --> 23:35.033
I SENSE SOMETHING IS VERY,
VERY, VERY WRONG

23:35.080 --> 23:37.571
ABOUT THESE PHOTOS,
VERY WRONG INDEED.

23:37.610 --> 23:40.477
JAN ANGLUND DOESN'T EXIST.

23:42.550 --> 23:44.188
THANK YOU AND GOOD NIGHT.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT A MINUTE!

23:44.220 --> 23:46.211
JAN--JANN IS REAL.

23:46.250 --> 23:47.717
WHY WOULD I MAKE ANY OF THIS UP?

23:47.760 --> 23:49.648
TO TRICK ME
INTO FALLING FOR YOU AGAIN.

23:49.690 --> 23:50.554
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'D GO

23:50.590 --> 23:53.923
THROUGH ALL OF THIS
JUST TO GET ME BACK.

23:53.960 --> 23:55.120
HOW SURE ARE YOU
ABOUT THIS THEORY?

23:55.160 --> 23:57.526
CRYSTAL.

23:57.570 --> 24:00.164
THAT DOESN'T REALLY WORK.
VERY, VERY SURE.

24:00.200 --> 24:04.603
MM-HMM.
THEN HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN HIM?

24:04.640 --> 24:06.005
[Mira gasps]

24:06.040 --> 24:07.166
JANN!

24:07.210 --> 24:09.701
(Jann)
MIRA, HONEY, I'M SO SORRY.

24:12.710 --> 24:15.110
I'M GONNA GRAB A CLARK BAR
FROM THE VENDING MACHINE.

24:15.150 --> 24:17.584
UH, ANYONE ELSE WANT ANYTHING?
CHIEF?

24:17.620 --> 24:18.917
JULES?

24:18.950 --> 24:21.885
GUS, YOU'RE GOOD?
OKAY.

24:25.660 --> 24:27.082
OH, HONEY--I LOOKED FOR YOU
AT THE WINERY,

24:27.130 --> 24:28.097
BUT THEY SAID
YOU WERE HERE.

24:28.130 --> 24:30.496
WHERE WERE YOU?

24:30.530 --> 24:31.497
YOU DIDN'T GET MY MESSAGE?

24:31.530 --> 24:32.827
(Mira)
WHAT MESSAGE?

24:32.870 --> 24:34.497
(Jann)
AT THE HOTEL DESK.

24:34.540 --> 24:35.768
UH, LOOK, I GOT A CALL

24:35.800 --> 24:37.961
TO CLOSE THIS DEAL WITH THESE
VENTURE CAPITALISTS IN PORTUGAL.

24:38.010 --> 24:39.966
IT WAS
FOR A VERY IMPORTANT CLIENT,

24:40.010 --> 24:41.568
AND I THOUGHT I COULD GET BACK
IN TIME.

24:41.610 --> 24:43.601
[whispers]
VENTURE CAPITALISTS,
REALLY?

24:43.650 --> 24:44.947
I'M SO SORRY.
I NEVER SHOULD HAVE GONE.

24:44.980 --> 24:46.800
I MISSED OUR BIG DAY.

24:46.850 --> 24:48.545
(Mira)
I'M JUST GLAD YOU'RE OKAY.

24:48.580 --> 24:50.582
WHY DON'T WE TALK
ABOUT THIS BACK AT THE WINERY

24:50.620 --> 24:52.212
AND SPEND SOME TIME
GETTING TO KNOW YOU.

24:52.250 --> 24:55.651
YEAH.
JUST GIVE ME ONE SECOND.

24:59.860 --> 25:01.828
YOU...BOTH.

25:01.860 --> 25:03.691
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT TO SAY TO YOU.

25:03.730 --> 25:07.996
HOW COULD YOU BE SO CRUEL?

25:08.040 --> 25:11.806
DOESN'T EXIST, HUH?
THAT'S GREAT.

25:11.840 --> 25:13.808
HEY, SHOULD I PUT OUT
AN IMAGINARY A.P.B. FOR HIM

25:13.840 --> 25:15.273
ON MY INVISIBLE RADIO?

25:15.310 --> 25:16.800
I HAVE A CASE TO WORK.

25:16.840 --> 25:18.068
SO DO I.

25:22.580 --> 25:23.842
DAMN IT, SHAWN.

25:23.890 --> 25:25.915
YOU MADE ME LOOK LIKE A FOOL
IN FRONT OF MIRA.

25:25.950 --> 25:27.713
DUDE, YOU KNOW DEEP, DEEP DOWN

25:27.760 --> 25:29.785
THAT THERE IS SOMETHING WEIRD
GOING ON HERE.

25:29.820 --> 25:31.321
WITH MIRA.

25:31.360 --> 25:33.590
WITH JAN SUDDENLY APPEARING
OUT OF NOWHERE.

25:33.630 --> 25:34.892
I'M GONNA PROVE IT TO YOU.

25:34.930 --> 25:37.057
I'M GONNA SHOW YOU
THAT SOMETHING'S GOING ON.

25:37.100 --> 25:38.124
NO.
NO MORE, SHAWN.

25:38.170 --> 25:39.899
STOP IT.
I'M SERIOUS ABOUT THIS.

25:39.930 --> 25:41.238
FINE.

25:41.270 --> 25:43.864
FOR YOU, I'LL STOP.

25:43.910 --> 25:45.866
THANK YOU.

25:53.210 --> 25:54.814
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

25:54.850 --> 25:57.114
WELL, I WAS HOPING TO SPEAK
WITH JAN FOR A MINUTE.

25:57.150 --> 25:58.344
JANN.

25:58.390 --> 26:00.017
I WON'T CALL HIM THAT.

26:00.050 --> 26:03.110
YEAH, HE'S OFF PLAYING GOLF
WITH MY FATHER.

26:03.160 --> 26:04.354
AH, SWEET.

26:04.390 --> 26:07.052
IS THAT IT?
'CAUSE I'M BUSY.

26:07.090 --> 26:09.695
ACTUALLY, THERE IS
ONE MORE THING.

26:09.730 --> 26:12.028
JUST BETWEEN YOU AND ME,

26:12.070 --> 26:15.289
WHY'D YOU FAKE THOSE PICTURES
OF YOU AND JAN?

26:15.340 --> 26:16.932
I MAY HAVE BEEN WRONG
ABOUT A COUPLE OF THINGS,

26:16.970 --> 26:19.768
BUT I KNOW FOR A FACT
THAT THOSE PICTURES ARE FAKES.

26:19.810 --> 26:22.005
JAN HAD A SHAVING CUT
IN THE SAME PLACE ON HIS NECK

26:22.040 --> 26:23.701
IN EACH ONE OF THESE PICTURES

26:23.750 --> 26:25.968
EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE TAKEN
AT DIFFERENT TIMES OF THE YEAR.

26:26.010 --> 26:29.776
IT'S GUS' FAULT.

26:29.820 --> 26:30.718
REALLY.

26:30.750 --> 26:32.308
EVER SINCE WHAT HAPPENED
BETWEEN HE AND I,

26:32.350 --> 26:33.681
MY PARENTS HAVE BEEN SKEPTICAL

26:33.720 --> 26:36.154
OF EVERY GUY I'VE BEEN WITH.

26:36.190 --> 26:40.058
ANDY, AMIR, GURU ANUPAM,
GAY AN DY, ANTHONY...

26:40.090 --> 26:41.921
DOES GAY ANDY KNOW
YOU CALL HIM THAT?

26:41.960 --> 26:44.394
HE GAVE HIMSELF THAT NAME.

26:44.430 --> 26:45.988
LOOK, JANN AND I HAD ONLY BEEN
TOGETHER FOR A FEW WEEKS

26:46.030 --> 26:47.998
WHEN WE DECIDED TO GET MARRIED,
AND I KNOW THAT'S CRAZY,

26:48.040 --> 26:50.634
BUT I JUST BELIEVE
IN ALL OR NOTHING.

26:50.670 --> 26:52.001
YOU KNOW,
DOING WHAT FEELS RIGHT.

26:52.040 --> 26:53.007
ARE YOU FOLLOWING ME, SHAWN?

26:53.040 --> 26:53.938
WHAT,
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

26:53.980 --> 26:55.231
I SPENT AN ENTIRE SEASON

26:55.280 --> 26:57.077
WITH AN INTERPRETIVE DANCE GROUP
IN BUFFALO.

26:57.110 --> 26:58.748
BUT, SEE, MY PARENTS
WERE AGAINST THIS THING

26:58.780 --> 26:59.849
FROM THE WHOLE BEGINNING.

26:59.880 --> 27:01.211
SO JANN PHOTOSHOPPED
SOME PICTURES

27:01.250 --> 27:02.717
TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE
WE HAD BEEN TOGETHER

27:02.750 --> 27:04.684
FOR LONGER THAN WE HAD,
AND IT WORKED.

27:04.720 --> 27:05.982
WAIT A SECOND.

27:06.020 --> 27:07.681
YOU'RE SAYING THE PICTURES
WERE JAN'S IDEA?

27:07.720 --> 27:09.688
NO, JANN.

27:09.720 --> 27:11.256
AND YEAH, HE'S THE ONE
WITH THE SUPER-FAST PRINTER.

27:11.290 --> 27:12.427
[phone rings]

27:12.460 --> 27:14.018
I GOTTA GET THAT.

27:14.060 --> 27:15.925
UH, THAT'S COMING
FROM THE ROOM NEXT DOOR.

27:15.960 --> 27:17.769
MIRA, MIRA, MIRA!

27:20.130 --> 27:21.961
I SAID I WAS SORRY
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED WITH MIRA.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.763
I AM TRYING TO MAKE IT UP
TO YOU HERE.

27:23.810 --> 27:24.936
COME ON, MAN,

27:24.970 --> 27:26.005
WE HAVEN'T PLAYED GOLF
IN FOREVER.

27:26.040 --> 27:27.837
THIS IS GONNA BE FUN.

27:27.880 --> 27:30.007
PLUS, I PROMISE TO KEEP
MY CADDYSHAC REFERENCES

27:30.040 --> 27:31.769
TO A MINIMUM.

27:34.480 --> 27:36.016
NOW, I'VE HEARD THIS CLUB
IS RESTRICTED,

27:36.050 --> 27:37.938
SO, UH, DON'T TELL 'EM
YOU'RE JEWISH.

27:37.990 --> 27:39.014
SHAWN.

27:39.050 --> 27:40.950
I DIDN'T SAY
I WOULDN'T MAKE ANY.

27:40.990 --> 27:44.050
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

27:44.090 --> 27:45.182
THE LADY'S TEE'S UP THERE.

27:59.010 --> 28:00.807
DUDE!

28:00.840 --> 28:01.807
YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE MORE FUN?

28:01.840 --> 28:03.068
STARTING
ON THE BACK NINE.

28:03.110 --> 28:05.169
WHY CAN'T WE JUST START
FROM HERE?

28:05.210 --> 28:09.078
I CAN PAR THIS HOLE
WITH THIS PUTT.

28:28.140 --> 28:29.892
YES, YES, YES.

28:29.940 --> 28:30.907
GREAT SHOT.
LET'S GO.

28:30.940 --> 28:32.066
SHAWN!

28:32.110 --> 28:33.168
SHAWN, GET BACK HERE

28:33.210 --> 28:36.202
BEFORE I ADD TWO STROKES
TO YOUR SCORE!

28:36.240 --> 28:37.468
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU?
SHH!

28:37.510 --> 28:40.502
(Gus)
IS THIS THE REAL REASON
YOU BROUGHT ME GOLFING?

28:40.550 --> 28:42.370
TO FOLLOW JANN?
I TOLD YOU TO DROP IT.

28:42.420 --> 28:45.048
HE'S BACK.
THERE'S NO MORE CASE.

28:45.090 --> 28:47.513
DUDE, YOU'RE WRONG.
JAN IS THE CASE.

28:47.550 --> 28:48.517
HE'S THE KEY.

28:48.560 --> 28:51.950
YOU'RE LOSING IT.

28:51.990 --> 28:54.129
GUS. GUS!

28:57.230 --> 28:59.528
THAT'S THE P.I.
FROM THE BATTING CAGES.

28:59.570 --> 29:01.765
EVEN YOU HAVE TO ADMIT
THIS IS GETTING WEIRD.

29:04.110 --> 29:09.309
ACT NATURAL.

29:09.340 --> 29:11.205
(Jann)
HEY, WHAT ARE
YOU GUYS DOING HERE?

29:11.250 --> 29:13.104
WHAT'S UP?

29:13.150 --> 29:14.879
JUST PLAYING
A LITTLE GOLF.

29:14.920 --> 29:17.218
KEEPING AN EYE OUT
FOR SUSPICIOUS MEETINGS

29:17.250 --> 29:18.478
BETWEEN SHADY PEOPLE.

29:18.520 --> 29:20.511
WHAT WERE YOU AND MACE RHODEN
ARGUING ABOUT?

29:20.550 --> 29:22.108
[laughs]

29:22.160 --> 29:23.013
THAT WAS NOTHING.

29:23.060 --> 29:25.085
YOU KNOW, I WAS THE GUY
WHO HIRED HIM.

29:25.130 --> 29:28.019
I WAS LATE PAYING,
SO HE WAS KIND OF UPSET.

29:28.060 --> 29:30.358
MAYBE MIRA DIDN'T TELL YOU,
BUT I'M A PSYCHIC, YEAH.

29:30.400 --> 29:33.028
AND RIGHT NOW THE SPIRITS
ARE SCREAMING SOMETHING

29:33.070 --> 29:35.095
IN MY HEAD
OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

29:35.140 --> 29:38.928
THEY'RE SAYING,
"SO SE PROMETER USAR AS PENAS."

29:38.970 --> 29:40.528
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

29:40.570 --> 29:43.277
IT'S PORTUGUESE FOR
"ONLY IF YOU PROMISE

29:43.310 --> 29:44.402
TO KEEP
YOUR FEATHERED HEADDRESS ON."

29:44.450 --> 29:47.078
HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY
DO BUSINESS

29:47.110 --> 29:49.817
IN PORTUGAL AND NOT SPEAK
A WORD OF THE LANGUAGE?

29:49.850 --> 29:51.886
WHY DID YOU
REALLY MISS THE WEDDING?

29:51.920 --> 29:55.185
OKAY, I WASN'T IN EUROPE.

29:55.220 --> 29:56.187
YES!

29:56.220 --> 29:57.209
LOOK, THE TRUTH IS,

29:57.260 --> 29:59.228
I WAS IN ANOTHER RELATIONSHIP.

29:59.260 --> 30:00.522
I WAS IN A BAD SITUATION.

30:00.560 --> 30:02.494
I HAD TO END IT BEFORE I
COULD GET MARRIED TO MIRA.

30:02.530 --> 30:04.122
YOU WERE CHEATING ON MIRA?

30:04.170 --> 30:05.421
NO, ALL RIGHT?
NO.

30:05.470 --> 30:07.836
NOT EXACTLY, OKAY?
IT STARTED BEFORE WE EVEN MET.

30:07.870 --> 30:10.907
AND I PROMISE YOU,
IT'S OVER NOW.

30:10.940 --> 30:12.908
I KNOW THAT I HAVEN'T
ALWAYS BEEN A GOOD GUY.

30:12.940 --> 30:16.239
BUT BEING WITH MIRA,

30:16.280 --> 30:18.168
YOU KNOW,
IT'S CHANGED ME.

30:18.210 --> 30:20.178
I REALIZE NOW
THAT SHE'S THE ONLY THING

30:20.210 --> 30:21.347
IN MY LIFE THAT MATTERS.

30:21.380 --> 30:22.938
AND YOU MAY NOT BELIEVE ME,

30:22.980 --> 30:25.187
BUT THAT IS THE TRUEST THING
I HAVE EVER SAID.

30:25.220 --> 30:29.259
LOOK, I'D BETTER GET BACK
BEFORE MIRA'S DAD

30:29.290 --> 30:30.359
DESPISES ME EVEN MORE.

30:36.600 --> 30:38.465
SHAWN...

30:38.500 --> 30:40.866
I'VE BEEN THERE BEFORE
WHEN IT COMES TO MIRA.

30:40.900 --> 30:42.231
HE'S TELLING THE TRUTH.

30:42.270 --> 30:45.159
YEAH,
BUT HE'S DEFINITELY LYING.

30:45.210 --> 30:47.064
HOW CAN HE BE DOING BOTH?

30:47.110 --> 30:48.270
TRUST ME.

30:48.310 --> 30:50.870
AS SOMEONE WHO HAS OCCASIONALLY
DEALT WITH HALF-TRUTHS,

30:50.910 --> 30:53.276
JAN BRADY IS NOT TELLING US
EVERYTHING.

30:53.310 --> 30:54.572
(Lassiter)
HE'S MY INFORMANT.

30:54.620 --> 30:56.349
I'LL GET
THE INFORMATION WE NEED.

30:56.380 --> 30:58.439
CARLTON,
THIS IS MY CASE.

30:58.490 --> 31:00.913
AND BESIDES, YOUR TOUGH-GUY
INTERROGATION TECHNIQUE,

31:00.960 --> 31:02.211
IT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

31:02.260 --> 31:03.249
OH, AND YOU THINK
SWEET AND GENTLE'S

31:03.290 --> 31:04.086
GONNA GET INFO
FROM A GUY LIKE THIS?

31:04.130 --> 31:06.280
PLEASE.
ALL I NEED IS 30 SECONDS.

31:06.330 --> 31:07.285
YOU COULD TIME ME.

31:07.330 --> 31:09.389
FINE, I'LL PLAY THAT GAME.

31:09.430 --> 31:10.397
AND I WILL BEAT YOU AT IT.

31:10.430 --> 31:12.022
FINE.
MCNAB!

31:12.070 --> 31:14.334
WE'RE COMMANDEERING
YOUR WATCH.

31:14.370 --> 31:15.268
YOU'RE COMMANDEERING MY--

31:15.300 --> 31:16.267
WATCH .

31:16.300 --> 31:18.939
OKAY.

31:21.510 --> 31:23.000
NOW WATCH...

31:23.040 --> 31:24.302
HOW I BREAK THIS GUY.

31:24.350 --> 31:26.102
IT'S ALL IN THE EYES.

31:30.420 --> 31:33.480
[stopwatch beeps]

31:48.470 --> 31:50.233
ALL RIGHT.

31:50.270 --> 31:51.237
YOU LITTLE SON OF A--

31:51.270 --> 31:52.237
TIME!

31:52.270 --> 31:53.532
WHAT?
I JUST GOT STARTED.

31:53.570 --> 31:54.969
THEY'RE YOUR RULES.

31:55.010 --> 31:56.329
CRAP.

32:00.510 --> 32:01.477
HEY.

32:01.520 --> 32:02.509
HI.

32:02.550 --> 32:04.347
YOU LOOK HUNGRY.

32:04.390 --> 32:06.119
KIN DA.

32:06.150 --> 32:08.015
THAN KS.

32:08.060 --> 32:10.187
SO...

32:10.220 --> 32:11.380
WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME

32:11.430 --> 32:12.954
ABOUT A REFRIGERATION TRUCK

32:12.990 --> 32:14.594
THAT WAS STOLEN A FEW DAYS AGO?

32:14.630 --> 32:17.292
REFRIGERATION TRUCK?

32:17.330 --> 32:21.369
OH, COME ON.
ALL I NEED'S A NAME, RUSTY.

32:21.400 --> 32:24.335
I KNOW ABOUT PRETTY MUCH
EVERY CAR BOOSTED

32:24.370 --> 32:26.634
IN SANTA BARBARA,

32:26.670 --> 32:28.171
BUT NOTHING AS POINTLESS

32:28.210 --> 32:29.279
AS STEALING
A REFRIGERATOR TRUCK.

32:29.310 --> 32:30.629
HONEST.

32:30.680 --> 32:32.272
[stopwatch beeps]

32:32.310 --> 32:33.379
TIME!

32:40.620 --> 32:42.679
ALL RIGHT,
CUT THE CRAP, RUSTY.

32:42.720 --> 32:44.688
WE BOTH KNOW
THAT YOU ARE HOLDING OUT ON ME.

32:44.730 --> 32:46.379
I WAS EATING
THAT CANDY BAR.

32:46.430 --> 32:48.295
WELL, THE CANDY POLICE
AREN'T HERE TODAY.

32:48.330 --> 32:49.558
IT'S JUST ME, AND I GOT
AT LEAST 12 DIFFERENT CHARGES

32:49.600 --> 32:51.067
I COULD PIN ON YOU.

32:51.100 --> 32:52.169
SO YOU BETTER START GIVING ME

32:52.200 --> 32:53.428
SOME GOOD INFORMATION.

32:53.470 --> 32:56.098
I DON'T KNOW.

32:56.140 --> 32:59.507
LOOK, THERE'S ONLY TWO REASONS
WHY ANYBODY STEALS A CAR.

32:59.540 --> 33:02.304
TO SELL IT OR TO USE IT.

33:02.340 --> 33:03.534
SINCE NOBODY'S COME DOWN
TO MY SHOP

33:03.580 --> 33:04.649
TO SELL ME
YOUR PRECIOUS LITTLE TRUCK,

33:04.680 --> 33:05.704
THEY NEED IT FOR SOMETHING.

33:05.750 --> 33:07.570
[stopwatch beeps]

33:07.610 --> 33:10.170
TIME!

33:10.220 --> 33:11.448
DON'T YOU DARE TELL HER A THING.

33:11.490 --> 33:13.685
OH, THAT'S GREAT
DETECTIVE WORK.

33:13.720 --> 33:16.086
PROBABLY WHY YOU SCORED A WHOLE
POINT LOWER THAN ME ON THE EXAM.

33:16.120 --> 33:17.087
SORRY TO INTERRUPT,

33:17.120 --> 33:18.678
BUT THE CHIEF NEEDS YOU
FOR AN IMPORTANT CASE.

33:24.200 --> 33:25.519
THEY TOOK
MY CLARK BAR.

33:25.570 --> 33:27.390
THEY TOOK MY WATCH.

33:32.470 --> 33:33.505
(Gus)
WHAT'S GOING ON?

33:33.540 --> 33:34.632
IT'S ABOUT MIRA'S FIANCE.

33:34.680 --> 33:38.104
I KNEW IT.
THE GUY'S A CROOK.

33:38.150 --> 33:40.471
ALL RIGHT!
PLAYTIME'S OVER, JAN!

33:40.510 --> 33:44.617
I'VE HAD A BAD PSYCHIC VIBE
ABOUT YOU FROM THE BEGINNING.

33:44.650 --> 33:46.186
WHY DON'T YOU GO AHEAD
AND TELL US

33:46.220 --> 33:50.316
WHAT YOU'VE
REALLY BEEN UP TO?

33:50.360 --> 33:52.328
WHENEVER YOU'RE READY, JAN.

33:54.100 --> 33:57.024
JAN?

33:58.830 --> 34:01.094
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S DO A LOOP.

34:01.140 --> 34:03.267
I KNEW JANN WAS BAD NEWS.

34:03.300 --> 34:06.098
WOW, GUS, YOU WERE SO RIGHT.
WHY DIDN'T I LISTEN TO YOU?

34:06.140 --> 34:08.472
WE NEED TO FIND OUT
WHO KILLED HIM.

34:08.510 --> 34:10.068
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

34:19.490 --> 34:21.549
DUDE, I HAVE A THEORY.

34:21.590 --> 34:24.150
I DON'T THINK JAN AND MACE
WERE JUST ARGUING ABOUT MONEY.

34:24.190 --> 34:25.589
WHAT ELSE
WERE THEY ARGUING ABOUT?

34:25.630 --> 34:26.483
I DON'T KNOW YET.

34:26.530 --> 34:28.452
BUT I WANT TO TALK
TO LASSIE AND JULES.

34:28.500 --> 34:29.751
LET'S GO.

34:29.800 --> 34:31.665
OH, YEAH, UM, I'M NOT
GONNA BE ABLE TO MAKE IT.

34:31.700 --> 34:32.689
I'MA GO BY THE WINERY.

34:32.730 --> 34:33.867
MIRA CALLED.

34:33.900 --> 34:35.333
SHE WAS WONDERING
IF I WOULD COME BY.

34:35.370 --> 34:36.337
GUS.

34:36.370 --> 34:37.735
I'LL BE FINE, SHAWN.

34:37.770 --> 34:40.364
I JUST WANNA BE THERE
FOR HER AS A FRIEND.

34:40.410 --> 34:41.570
ALL RIGHT.

34:41.610 --> 34:42.634
COOL.

34:44.410 --> 34:45.604
OH, GOOD.
YOU'RE ALL HERE.

34:45.650 --> 34:47.174
I'M HAVING A PSYCHIC VISION
ABOUT JAN,

34:47.210 --> 34:48.871
AND I HAVE A THEORY
ABOUT WHO MAY HAVE KILLED HIM.

34:48.920 --> 34:52.686
LET'S JUST TAKE
A STEP BACK, MR. SPENCER.

34:52.720 --> 34:54.483
WHA--

34:54.520 --> 34:56.579
I JUST GOT
THE FINGERPRINT RESULTS

34:56.620 --> 34:58.850
FROM THE REFRIGERATOR
TRUCK CASE.

34:58.890 --> 35:01.495
DO YOU WANNA TAKE TURNS
WITH THIS?

35:01.530 --> 35:02.849
TAKE TURNS?
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

35:02.900 --> 35:05.118
O'HARA AND I HAVE
A LITTLE COMPETITION--EXCUSE ME.

35:05.170 --> 35:06.489
COMPETITION?

35:06.530 --> 35:08.259
IT IS NOT
A COMPETITION.

35:08.300 --> 35:12.134
LASSITER IS JUST BEING A CHILD
ABOUT HIS DETECTIVE EXAM SCORE.

35:12.170 --> 35:14.570
WAIT, THE D.E.T.?
I TOOK THAT WHEN I WAS 15.

35:14.610 --> 35:15.577
I GOT 100.

35:15.610 --> 35:16.599
I'M SORRY.

35:16.640 --> 35:17.607
YOU SAID YOU GOT
A PERFECT SCORE?

35:17.640 --> 35:18.607
YEAH.

35:18.650 --> 35:19.605
AND YOU WERE 15?

35:19.650 --> 35:20.605
YEAH.

35:20.650 --> 35:22.675
WHY?
WHAT DID YOU GUYS GET?

35:22.720 --> 35:25.245
YOU KNOW, IT'S PROBABLY CHANGED
A LOT SINCE THEN.

35:25.290 --> 35:26.439
YOU REALLY CAN'T COMPARE IT.

35:26.490 --> 35:27.445
(Juliet)
APPLES AND ORANGES.

35:27.490 --> 35:29.378
HE CHEATED ON ME,
AND THEN HE LIED TO ME

35:29.420 --> 35:31.684
ABOUT MISSING THE WEDDING,
AND NOW HE'S DEAD.

35:31.730 --> 35:32.822
I KNOW EXACTLY
HOW YOU FEEL.

35:32.860 --> 35:33.827
REALLY?

35:33.860 --> 35:34.929
WELL...NO.

35:34.960 --> 35:37.690
I ALWAYS KNEW THAT THERE WAS
SOMETHING WRONG WITH JANN.

35:37.730 --> 35:39.322
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING,
THERE WAS A LITTLE VOICE

35:39.370 --> 35:40.667
INSIDE ME THAT SAID
IT WAS ALL WRONG,

35:40.700 --> 35:43.168
BUT I DIDN'T LISTEN
'CAUSE HE HAD ANDY'S LAUGH,

35:43.200 --> 35:48.331
AND GAY ANDY'S SENSE OF STYLE,
AND YOUR HEART.

35:48.380 --> 35:51.543
AT LEAST THAT'S
WHAT I THOUGHT.

35:51.580 --> 35:53.502
[glass shatters]

35:53.550 --> 35:54.574
WHAT WAS THAT?

35:54.620 --> 35:55.644
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT MY PARENTS ARE GONE,

35:55.680 --> 35:57.648
AND THE VINEYARD'S CLOSED.

36:02.960 --> 36:04.882
(Gus)
SOMEBODY'S BEEN IN HERE.

36:04.930 --> 36:07.649
YEAH, I THINK MAYBE WE SHOULD
CALL THE POLICE.

36:07.690 --> 36:11.626
GOOD IDEA.

36:11.670 --> 36:13.422
[gaSPSJ

36:14.500 --> 36:17.389
OFFICER MCNAB, YOU WERE SAYING?

36:17.440 --> 36:18.634
UH, YEAH, THE LAB MATCHED
ONE OF THE PRINTS

36:18.670 --> 36:19.637
FROM THE GOLD LIGHTER
THAT WAS DROPPED

36:19.670 --> 36:20.534
WHEN THE TRUCK WAS STOLEN

36:20.570 --> 36:23.573
TO A KNOWN CONVICT
NAMED MARCUS RIDLEY,

36:23.610 --> 36:25.441
A.K.A. MIKE RAY,
A.K.A.--

36:25.480 --> 36:26.572
OW, OW, OW, MY EYES!
IT'S BURNING!

36:26.610 --> 36:27.577
IT'S STINGING!

36:27.610 --> 36:29.749
AH!

36:29.780 --> 36:31.384
STUFF THAT OLD WOMEN CARRY
IN THEIR PURSES!

36:31.420 --> 36:32.580
VELAMINTS?

36:32.620 --> 36:33.712
NO, IT'S MORE OF AN AEROSOL.

36:33.750 --> 36:34.785
BINACA!

36:34.820 --> 36:36.685
IT'S NOT A BREATH FRESHENER!

36:36.720 --> 36:38.529
MACE!
YES.

36:38.560 --> 36:39.720
MACE RHODEN.
THAT'S RIGHT.

36:42.700 --> 36:44.998
WAS THE TRUCK YELLOW?

36:45.030 --> 36:46.725
WELL, MORE LIKE A MUSTARD,
BUT YEAH.

36:46.770 --> 36:48.499
OH, I'M GETTING ANOTHER VISION.

36:48.540 --> 36:49.996
TWO, TWO, TWO VISIONS IN ONE.

36:50.040 --> 36:53.362
IT'S GUS AND THE TRUCK
IN THE SAME PLACE.

36:53.410 --> 36:54.638
GUS IS IN DANGER.

36:54.680 --> 36:59.208
WE HAVE TO SAVE GUS!
COME ON!

37:01.620 --> 37:03.838
ALL RIGHT, I LEI-T
MR. AND MRS. GAFFNEY A MESSAGE,

37:03.880 --> 37:04.915
BUT GUS ISN'T PICKING UP AT ALL.

37:04.950 --> 37:05.917
SOMEONE GIVE ME A GUN.

37:06.950 --> 37:08.383
WHAT EXACTLY
IS GOING ON?

37:08.420 --> 37:09.751
OKAY, OKAY,
REMEMBER WHEN I SAID

37:09.790 --> 37:11.257
THAT JAN ANGLUND DIDN'T EXIST?

37:11.290 --> 37:13.520
WELL, TECHNICALLY I WAS RIGHT.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

37:13.560 --> 37:14.822
FORGET THAT.
I WAS TOTALLY RIGHT.

37:14.860 --> 37:16.396
HE'S NOT JAN ANGLUND.

37:16.430 --> 37:18.489
HE'S A CON MAN WORKING
WITH MACE RHODEN,

37:18.530 --> 37:20.998
THE GUY WHO STOLE
YOUR MUSTARD REFRIGERATOR TRUCK.

37:21.030 --> 37:23.294
KEEP TALKING.

37:23.340 --> 37:24.898
WELL, A FEW MONTHS AGO,
THEY STARTED A LONG CON

37:24.940 --> 37:27.261
ON MIRA GAFFN EY.

37:27.310 --> 37:29.301
THE PLAN WAS FOR JAN
TO ROMANCE MIRA

37:29.340 --> 37:31.399
AND MARRY HER ON THE BEACH
IN SANTA BARBARA.

37:31.450 --> 37:33.645
BUT MIRA'S PARENTS ASKED
TOO MANY QUESTIONS.

37:33.680 --> 37:35.272
SO JAN DOCTORED
THE PHOTOS

37:35.320 --> 37:36.742
TO CONVINCE THEM
TO HAVE THE WEDDING.

37:36.780 --> 37:38.589
SEE, MY PARENTS WERE AGAINST
THIS THING FROM THE BEGINNING,

37:38.620 --> 37:39.689
SO JANN PHOTOSHOPPED
SOME PICTURES

37:39.720 --> 37:40.846
TO MAKE IT LOOK
LIKE WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER

37:40.890 --> 37:43.313
FOR LONGER THAN WE HAD,
AND IT WORKED.

37:43.360 --> 37:45.555
THE WEDDING WAS MERELY A COVER,

37:45.590 --> 37:47.979
SO THAT MIRA'S FATHER WOULD
SHUT DOWN THE WINERY FOR A DAY.

37:48.030 --> 37:50.828
JAN INTENDED TO LEAVE MIRA
AT THE ALTAR,

37:50.860 --> 37:52.999
WHILE MACE BROKE
INTO DAVID GAFFNEY'S CELLAR

37:53.030 --> 37:56.431
TO STEAL HIS PRICELESS
WINE COLLECTION AND SKIP TOWN.

37:56.470 --> 37:58.301
BUT THERE WAS NO ROBBERY
AT THE WINERY.

37:58.340 --> 37:59.705
AND JAN DIDN'T SKIP TOWN.
HE CAME BACK.

37:59.740 --> 38:01.059
HE HAD A CHANGE OF HEART.

38:01.110 --> 38:02.407
OH, DON'T--

38:02.440 --> 38:03.577
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MIRA.

38:03.610 --> 38:05.908
JAN WAS TELLING THE TRUTH
AND LYING AT THE SAME TIME.

38:05.950 --> 38:09.010
THE TRUTH IS,
I WAS IN ANOTHER RELATIONSHIP.

38:09.050 --> 38:10.369
I WAS IN A BAD SITUATION.

38:10.420 --> 38:12.411
I HAD TO END IT
BEFORE I COULD MARRY MIRA.

38:12.450 --> 38:14.850
HIS OTHER RELATIONSHIP
WAS WITH HIS PARTNER MACE.

38:14.890 --> 38:16.755
HE ENDED IT
BECAUSE HE ACTUALLY FELL IN LOVE

38:16.790 --> 38:18.758
WITH MIRA AND COULDN'T
GO THROUGH WITH THE PLAN.

38:18.790 --> 38:20.587
THAT'S WHY THEY ARGUED
AT THE GOLF COURSE.

38:20.630 --> 38:21.995
AND THAT'S WHY MACE KILLED HIM.

38:22.030 --> 38:23.588
BUT WHY IS GUSTER IN TROUBLE?

38:25.030 --> 38:26.861
THE GAFFNEYS ARE MOVING
THEIR MOST EXPENSIVE BOTTLES

38:26.900 --> 38:28.333
OF WINE TO NAPA TOMORROW.

38:28.370 --> 38:30.861
MEANING THAT MACE
IS STEALING THEM RIGHT NOW!

38:30.900 --> 38:32.003
SOMEBODY GIVE ME A GUN!

38:32.040 --> 38:33.530
T: if :5:

38:33.570 --> 38:35.572
THEN DRIVE FASTER!
THAT'S MY BEST FRIEND IN THERE!

38:43.880 --> 38:45.416
GOOD!
YOU GOT MY MESSAGE.

38:45.450 --> 38:46.883
YEAH, WE LOOKED.
WE CAN'T FIND 'EM ANYWHERE.

38:46.920 --> 38:50.879
THE WINE CELLAR.
GUS!

38:50.920 --> 38:51.921
GUS!

38:53.790 --> 38:55.826
DON'T SHOOT!
EVERYTHING'S OKAY.

38:55.860 --> 38:56.849
MIRA?

38:56.900 --> 38:58.492
MOM!
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

38:58.530 --> 38:59.895
WHAT HAVE YOU GOTTEN HER INTO?

38:59.930 --> 39:01.739
GUS!
DON'T SPEAK.

39:01.770 --> 39:06.036
I CAN TELL YOU PRECISELY
WHAT HAPPENED HERE, SIR.

39:06.070 --> 39:08.834
GUS AND MIRA DISCOVERED, UH,
MACE RHODEN ROBBING THE CELLAR.

39:08.880 --> 39:11.132
HE PULLED A GUN.

39:11.180 --> 39:12.147
HE TIED THEM UP.

39:12.180 --> 39:13.977
AND GUS ASSESSED THE SITUATION

39:14.010 --> 39:15.739
AND DEVISED
THE FOLLOWING BRILLIANT PLAN.

39:15.780 --> 39:17.418
HE FINESSED THEM LOOSE.

39:17.450 --> 39:19.748
HE TOLD MIRA TO PERFORM
HER DRAGON-HEADED BAR TRICK

39:19.790 --> 39:21.553
THAT MADE HIM FALL FOR HER
IN THE FIRST PLACE,

39:21.590 --> 39:22.887
TRIGGERING THE SPRINKLERS.

39:22.920 --> 39:25.855
THEY WRESTLED
OVER THE GUN.

39:25.890 --> 39:28.154
[screams like a girl]

39:28.190 --> 39:30.693
MIRA FAINTED.

39:30.730 --> 39:33.062
AND WE WALKED IN JUST AS GUS
D.T.D.'D THE BAD GUY.

39:33.100 --> 39:34.931
WELL DONE, GUSTER.

39:34.970 --> 39:35.937
WELL DONE.

39:35.970 --> 39:37.733
THANK YOU, SIR.

39:37.770 --> 39:39.761
VERY IMPRESSIVE.
YEAH, VERY QUICK THINKING.

39:39.810 --> 39:42.404
I WAS JUST DOING WHAT
ANYONE WOULD HAVE DONE.

39:43.740 --> 39:44.775
HONEY, LET'S GET YOU
OUT OF HERE.

39:44.810 --> 39:46.402
BUT I DON'T REMEM--

39:46.450 --> 39:47.576
DARLING, COME HERE.

39:47.610 --> 39:49.646
COME ON, SWEETIE.

39:49.680 --> 39:50.874
YEP.
LET'S GO.

39:50.920 --> 39:52.080
YEAH, IT'S TIME TO GO.
EW!

39:52.120 --> 39:53.439
GOD, HE'S ALL WET.

39:53.490 --> 39:54.582
HERE.

39:57.760 --> 39:59.523
DUDE, THAT'S NOT
HOW IT HAPPENED.

39:59.560 --> 40:00.879
I KNOW.

40:00.930 --> 40:01.828
MACE'S CIGARETTE TRIGGERED
THE SPRINKLERS,

40:01.860 --> 40:02.895
AND HE SLIPPED AND FELL?

40:02.930 --> 40:06.161
AND THEN I MAY HAVE KNOCKED
MIRA OVER AS I RAN AWAY.

40:06.200 --> 40:07.792
LET'S KEEP THAT LAST PART
TO OURSELVES.

40:07.830 --> 40:10.765
BET.

40:14.810 --> 40:17.699
YOU GUYS,
IT'S BEEN SUCH A CRAZY WEEK.

40:17.740 --> 40:21.619
BUT THANKS TO YOU BOTH,
I'M GONNA GET THROUGH IT.

40:21.650 --> 40:22.469
SO THANK YOU.

40:22.520 --> 40:25.216
OH, OH, SHAWN,
GUS AND ME ARE GONNA GO

40:25.250 --> 40:27.013
ROCK CLIMBING
IN RATTLESNAKE CANYON.

40:27.050 --> 40:28.210
AND THEN I'M GONNA TEACH HIM
HOW TO HANG GLIDE

40:28.250 --> 40:29.786
OFF CATHEDRAL PEAK.

40:29.820 --> 40:31.549
AND IT'S GONNA BE SO AMAZING.

40:31.590 --> 40:33.649
DO YOU WANNA COME?

40:33.690 --> 40:34.759

40:39.070 --> 40:40.128
WE JUST GOT A CALL

40:40.170 --> 40:41.467
FROM A PROSPECTIVE CLIENT.

40:41.500 --> 40:43.798
SOMETHING ABOUT A GHOST
IN A BALLROOM.

40:43.840 --> 40:45.000
WE SHOULD PROBABLY
GO WORK ON THAT.

40:45.040 --> 40:46.109
IS THAT OKAY, MIRA?

40:46.140 --> 40:48.506
OH, OF COURSE.
I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND.

40:48.540 --> 40:49.575
YOU GUYS
DO AMAZING WORK.

40:49.610 --> 40:52.943
BUT I JUST WANNA SEE YOU BOTH
BEFORE I LEAVE.

40:52.980 --> 40:56.040
MIRA'S MOVING TO GREENLAND
TO SAVE POLAR BEARS.

40:56.080 --> 40:57.547
OF COURSE YOU ARE.

40:58.690 --> 41:00.043

I AM?

41:01.720 --> 41:04.780
YEAH, REMEMBER?
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS, SILLY.

41:04.830 --> 41:06.081

41:16.740 --> 41:18.059
AND THANK YOU
FOR PUTTING UP WITH ME

41:18.100 --> 41:19.067
THROUGHOUT THIS WHOLE THING.

WHIPPED.

41:23.910 --> 41:26.071

BUT, SURE, FINE.

41:26.110 --> 41:27.839
AND ONCE AGAIN,
I JUST WANNA SAY

41:27.880 --> 41:29.871
FOR THE RECORD,
I'M SORRY

41:29.920 --> 41:31.239
I NEVER TOLD YOU

I UNDERSTAND.

41:33.590 --> 41:36.218
NOW I REALLY UNDERSTAND.

41:36.260 --> 41:38.057
BESIDES, I'VE BEEN FEELING
A LITTLE GUILTY MYSELF.

41:38.090 --> 41:39.523
ABOUT WHAT?

41:39.560 --> 41:42.051
ABOUT NOT TELLING YOU
THAT I TOO WAS MARRIED.

41:42.100 --> 41:44.227
[scoffs]
WHAT?
YOU WERE NOT MARRIED, SHAWN.

41:44.260 --> 41:45.261
PLEASE.

41:47.270 --> 41:49.135
THIS IS A FAKE, RIGHT?

41:49.170 --> 41:52.799
I KNOW THIS IS FAKE.
YOU PHOTOSHOPPED THIS.
