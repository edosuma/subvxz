this, Miami.

one last coat of
spell-repellant.

00:28.862 --> 00:30.864

shield "Sharky"?

00:30.947 --> 00:31.698
- It's short for
Ultimate Sharkinator,

00:31.781 --> 00:34.826
the Bringer of Spelldoom.

00:34.909 --> 00:36.661
- Go to your dorm room.

00:36.745 --> 00:37.829
- But, my shield.

00:37.912 --> 00:40.749
Are you ever gonna
get off my case?

00:55.430 --> 00:57.223
- No, just outside
the Academy.

00:57.307 --> 00:59.309
Maybe this is where
she hides her loot.

00:59.392 --> 01:01.978
Wait.

01:02.061 --> 01:03.062
I lost her signal.

01:03.146 --> 01:03.688
Something's blocking it.

01:03.772 --> 01:06.149
- What if she's on to us?

01:06.232 --> 01:07.150
She's probably getting some
kind of doomsday device

to destroy the Academy.

El Capitán comic from Jessie.

No.

This afternoon we will
hold the Shield Trials.

we have an ace up our sleeve.

02:26.646 --> 02:28.690

throws a spell at us

thrown back at them.

02:31.651 --> 02:33.069
Ka-blaam!

02:33.152 --> 02:35.488

a little twist,

02:35.572 --> 02:39.701
all WITS will swap back to
their original Guardians.

02:39.784 --> 02:41.202
- Hang on.

02:41.286 --> 02:43.246
So the WITS that
are going to attack me

02:43.329 --> 02:44.998
will know
my shield's secrets?

02:45.081 --> 02:47.417
- That's the idea.

02:47.500 --> 02:49.419
- Amulet? What Amulet?

02:49.502 --> 02:51.254
I didn't put no Amulet
on our shield.

02:51.337 --> 02:56.175
- The WITs-Back-Swap
will be effective immediately.

02:56.259 --> 02:58.595
- Get down here.

03:01.306 --> 03:03.057
I'm gonna miss you.

03:10.857 --> 03:12.609
- Want your WITs back?

them, did you?

03:18.489 --> 03:19.866
- Andi!

03:22.660 --> 03:24.621
- What? No love?

- Shhhh!

03:39.218 --> 03:40.803
Miss Foiler is under
the impression

03:40.887 --> 03:43.056
we sent you to Limbo.

03:43.139 --> 03:45.642
If she realizes
you're still here,

03:45.725 --> 03:48.645
the jig is up,

03:48.728 --> 03:51.564

send him to Limbo.

03:51.648 --> 03:53.691
- I'm sorry, sir,
uh, sirs.

03:53.775 --> 03:56.402
- Ah, I have the coordinates
to Foiler's hideout.

03:56.486 --> 03:57.028
All I need is a map.

03:57.111 --> 03:58.947
- I remember seeing a map

03:59.030 --> 04:01.991
with the original blueprints
of the Academy

04:02.075 --> 04:03.159
somewhere in here.

- Oh, Foiler!
She's on her way in here.

04:06.746 --> 04:08.456
- Cameron, hide.

04:12.961 --> 04:14.504
- Ah, Mr. Archer.

04:14.587 --> 04:17.507
Just the man
I was looking for.

04:17.589 --> 04:20.468
Well, now that Cameron,

04:20.551 --> 04:24.305
that rotten, horrible boy,
has been detained...

04:24.389 --> 04:25.390

04:25.473 --> 04:28.059
You see, I'm a teacher,
not a deputy.

So I will no longer
be needing this.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.023

04:34.107 --> 04:36.901
- I must say, I never
did trust Cameron--

04:36.985 --> 04:41.572
with that snickery smile
and those twitchy little eyes.

04:41.656 --> 04:43.533
- Coach Foiler.
- Hm?

04:43.616 --> 04:44.784
- Kindly see to it

04:44.867 --> 04:49.330
that the outdoor arena is
all set for the Shield Trials.

04:49.414 --> 04:55.545
I want bleachers, and flags,
and fanfare, hm?

04:55.628 --> 04:56.879

And those mini-hotdogs
wrapped in buttery pastry.

pineapple refreshments

05:04.053 --> 05:08.558

tiny umbrellas

05:08.641 --> 05:12.937

shields and...

05:13.021 --> 05:14.731
and that'll be all.

05:16.149 --> 05:19.360
We need to find
you a disguise.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.823
- A little magic boost

05:23.906 --> 05:25.783
before a big competition
never hurt anybody.

05:31.706 --> 05:34.334
What?

Where did it all go?

06:05.364 --> 06:07.325
Why don't you
have any magic?

06:07.408 --> 06:10.745
- I do. It's just I put too
much into the last spell.

06:10.828 --> 06:12.872
You know, like when
the Captain fires his phaser

06:12.955 --> 06:14.999
before it's
fully recharged?

06:15.083 --> 06:15.833
- Seriously, Em?

06:15.917 --> 06:17.210
- What?

06:17.293 --> 06:19.921
- The Captain doesn't
use a phaser.

06:20.004 --> 06:22.715
He has Ninja stars.
Duh!

06:22.799 --> 06:25.426

Oh.

happened yesterday?

06:33.768 --> 06:35.019
It's all a bit
of a blur.

06:35.103 --> 06:36.604
- You don't remember?

06:36.687 --> 06:37.939
You got hit with your
own Docile Spell.

06:38.022 --> 06:40.233
- I did?
How bad was it?

06:40.316 --> 06:42.819
- You thought
the tree sap was icky,

06:42.902 --> 06:45.238
and you threw it away.

06:45.321 --> 06:46.614

talking about?

06:46.697 --> 06:48.241

Nothing!

06:48.324 --> 06:50.743
- Fine, keep
me out of the loop.

06:50.827 --> 06:53.162
You know what?
Maybe I will switch teams.

06:56.749 --> 06:59.544
- That's it.
I'm finished.

06:59.627 --> 07:01.504

to get more tree sap.

07:01.587 --> 07:02.839

to get into that room.

I'm never gonna
get back in there.

You have no idea
what it's like

07:11.264 --> 07:14.767
to be a witch
with no powers.

07:16.060 --> 07:17.520
- I'm so stoked.

If I beat Luke at the Shield
Trials this afternoon,

relays will be enough

07:24.944 --> 07:28.239

favorite Attack Spell.

07:28.322 --> 07:29.907
They call it
the "Big Boom."

it was Ruby?

her powers again?

07:50.136 --> 07:51.387
- No.

It was Foiler.

08:01.564 --> 08:04.275
Are those catacombs
underneath the school?

08:04.358 --> 08:06.819

a need-to-know basis.
