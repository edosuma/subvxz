00:02.756 --> 00:05.155
Hi, it's been 20 minutes.
Have you decided?

00:05.456 --> 00:07.255
Uh, we still need more time,
can you come back?

00:07.556 --> 00:09.655
Sure. And I'm back.

00:10.756 --> 00:13.555
Come on guys you're not buying a house.
Everything sucks.

00:13.956 --> 00:16.355
Pick the thing that sucks the least,
and put it in you mouth.

00:16.756 --> 00:18.655
Max, everyone keeps telling me
they can't decide,

00:18.956 --> 00:20.955
it's like a support group
for bi-sexuals.

00:22.556 --> 00:24.255
Something very magical
about to happen...

00:25.756 --> 00:27.407
Please let it be
the rapture.

00:27.409 --> 00:28.975
I need a day off.

00:28.977 --> 00:32.628
In two minutes,
something very hip is happening.

00:32.631 --> 00:33.797
If you have a camera,

00:33.799 --> 00:36.383
make sure the flash
is on.

00:36.385 --> 00:39.085
Why is he speaking
like that?

00:39.087 --> 00:41.254
Wait a minute.

00:41.256 --> 00:42.806
No one's ordering.

00:42.808 --> 00:45.142
People keep checking the time
on their phones.

00:45.144 --> 00:49.546
Everyone's wearing
matching new balance sneakers.

00:49.548 --> 00:51.031
Flash mob!

00:52.151 --> 00:54.784
♪ Party rockers
in the house tonight ♪

00:54.786 --> 00:56.720
♪ whoo!

but I'll be damned

01:12.504 --> 01:15.639
if any more of that crap
gets by me.

01:17.758 --> 01:19.843
Why is flash mob over?

01:19.845 --> 01:22.479
Flash mobs were over
a year ago.

01:22.481 --> 01:24.481
Nobody told Han!

01:24.483 --> 01:26.016
I want so bad to be hip.

01:26.018 --> 01:29.085
Start by
never saying that again.

02:01.931 --> 02:04.316
Hello?

02:04.318 --> 02:05.484
Max, phone!

02:05.486 --> 02:07.736
No!

02:07.738 --> 02:09.238
What are you doing?

02:11.742 --> 02:13.242
Only two people
call the wall...

02:13.244 --> 02:14.443
collection agencies

02:14.445 --> 02:16.161
and the landlord, looking
for the original tenant

02:16.163 --> 02:17.079
whose name is on the lease!

02:17.081 --> 02:18.697
- Hang up. Quick!
- Too late.

02:18.699 --> 02:20.415
I've got to man up
and face it.

02:22.836 --> 02:26.237
Hello?

02:26.239 --> 02:28.423
This is what collection agency?

02:28.425 --> 02:31.293
No, my granddaughter Max
is not here.

02:31.295 --> 02:32.911
She died.

02:32.913 --> 02:35.347
On her deathbed,
she said it was the stress

02:35.349 --> 02:38.884
of being constantly harassed
by creditors.

02:38.886 --> 02:40.369
That's juvenile.

02:40.371 --> 02:42.871
Give me the phone.

02:42.873 --> 02:44.856
Hi.
So sorry about that.

02:44.858 --> 02:46.391
What's the issue exactly?

02:46.393 --> 02:48.644
Well, I'm sure
she has every intention...

02:48.646 --> 02:49.945
mm-hmm.

02:49.947 --> 02:51.096
Mm-hmm.

02:51.098 --> 02:52.698
Mm-hmm.

02:52.700 --> 02:53.949
Oh.

02:53.951 --> 02:57.903
Well, you're a doody head.

02:57.905 --> 02:59.404
Never answer the wall.

02:59.406 --> 03:01.523
But what are you
gonna do about it?

03:01.525 --> 03:04.409
You can't just keep lying
to collection agencies.

03:04.411 --> 03:06.662
You have to pay your bills.
I have a system.

03:06.664 --> 03:08.279
I pay everyone
five dollars a week...

03:08.281 --> 03:09.998
just enough to keep them
from freaking out.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.450
It's the methadone-clinic
banking system.

03:12.452 --> 03:15.170
That is a complete waste
of money.

03:15.172 --> 03:17.556
Five dollars won't even cover
the interest you're accruing.

03:17.558 --> 03:19.308
What's the interest rate
on your credit card?

03:19.310 --> 03:20.759
Don't know,
but my interest rate

03:20.761 --> 03:23.011
in the conversation is zero.

03:23.013 --> 03:25.263
Max, how could you
not know that?

03:25.265 --> 03:26.481
That's one of the first things

03:26.483 --> 03:27.966
my father taught me
about finance.

03:27.968 --> 03:30.736
Where...
at Embezzle U.?

03:35.141 --> 03:37.242
Max, I interned
at Merrill Lynch.

03:37.244 --> 03:40.078
Let me help you with this.
It's the least I can do.

03:40.080 --> 03:42.197
I had nowhere to go.
You took me in.

03:42.199 --> 03:44.750
Let me repay my debt to you
by helping with your debt

03:44.752 --> 03:47.536
to everyone in the world,
apparently.

03:47.538 --> 03:48.704
If you keep talking,

03:48.706 --> 03:51.039
<i>I'm going to
Merrill Lynch myself.</i>

03:51.041 --> 03:52.791
I'm one of those people

03:52.793 --> 03:55.711
who gets off on untangling
big, complicated messes.

03:55.713 --> 03:57.462
And since you won't let me
do your hair,

03:57.464 --> 04:00.298
let me do your bills.

04:00.300 --> 04:04.469
You want to do my bills?

04:09.225 --> 04:13.095
Here's my portfolio.

04:15.181 --> 04:17.616
And, uh, if you find
chocolate sprinkles in there,

04:17.618 --> 04:18.983
they're not chocolate...

04:18.986 --> 04:21.103
Or sprinkles.

04:26.358 --> 04:27.542
Okay.

04:27.544 --> 04:29.861
I've divided your bills
into three categories...

04:29.863 --> 04:32.464
"impossible,"
"next to impossible,"

04:32.466 --> 04:36.051
and "how the hell
did that happen?"

04:36.053 --> 04:38.587
And I've divided my roommate
into three categories...

04:38.589 --> 04:40.472
"annoying,"
"super annoying,"

04:40.474 --> 04:43.759
and "how the hell
did that happen?"

04:44.845 --> 04:46.561
I'm closing kitchen
in ten minutes.

04:46.563 --> 04:48.397
I cannot stay later.

04:48.399 --> 04:50.715
I have date with new woman
in my life.

04:50.717 --> 04:52.517
She's very special to me.

04:52.519 --> 04:54.403
I think she may be the one.

04:54.405 --> 04:58.407
You are both welcome
to come watch us have sex.

04:58.409 --> 04:59.908
Just putting it out there.

04:59.910 --> 05:01.860
Just put it back in there.

05:04.396 --> 05:06.531
I'm so excited, I don't even
know where to start.

05:06.533 --> 05:08.200
Drumroll, please.

05:08.202 --> 05:10.585
No?
Okay.

05:10.587 --> 05:12.204
Oh, interesting.

05:12.206 --> 05:13.922
Here we have a bill
from the pet castle,

05:13.924 --> 05:17.092
yet you don't have a pet, and
you've never been to a castle...

05:17.094 --> 05:19.711
Oh, except white castle.

05:19.713 --> 05:21.263
You used a credit card
at white castle?

05:21.265 --> 05:24.415
Yep.
That was good weed.

05:24.417 --> 05:26.351
And the pet thing was
'cause I found a stray

05:26.353 --> 05:27.436
and had to have her
cleaned up

05:27.438 --> 05:28.887
before I could get anyone
to take her.

05:28.889 --> 05:30.889
That would also explain
the charge for neutering.

05:30.891 --> 05:32.691
Nah, actually,
that was for me.

05:32.693 --> 05:34.943
Can't have any more
of these coming out.

05:34.945 --> 05:36.594
Do you really think

05:36.596 --> 05:38.763
it's fiscally smart
to be taking in strays?

05:38.765 --> 05:41.933
Good point.
Move out tonight.

05:41.935 --> 05:44.102
What is this...
a student loan?

05:44.104 --> 05:47.789
Oh, my God.
Max, you went to college?

05:47.791 --> 05:49.825
That wasn't a judgment.
It was just shocking...

05:49.827 --> 05:54.713
kind of like seeing
a baby smoke on the Internet.

05:55.948 --> 05:58.116
I love that kid.

05:59.418 --> 06:02.637
Max, a student loan is
the worst bill you can ignore.

06:02.639 --> 06:04.339
It can never be expunged.

06:04.341 --> 06:06.641
We're breaking out "expunged"
on a weeknight?

06:06.643 --> 06:08.977
You can't run away
from this bill.

06:08.979 --> 06:10.679
I can run away
from anything.

06:10.681 --> 06:14.015
I'm on my fifth identity.

06:14.017 --> 06:15.984
It's just like that
but underwater!

06:15.986 --> 06:16.968
Guys!

06:16.970 --> 06:19.187
Sorry,
we're just closing, guys.

06:19.189 --> 06:21.990
I'll take them, Max.
We need the...

06:24.494 --> 06:27.445
uh, sit anywhere.

06:29.699 --> 06:32.334
What was that roadrunner move
you just pulled?

06:32.336 --> 06:34.336
There's still a smoke outline
of your body

06:34.338 --> 06:36.654
Hanging in the air
out there.

06:36.656 --> 06:39.007
Did Wile E. Coyote
just come in the diner?

06:39.009 --> 06:41.726
- No, but my ex-boyfriend did.

06:41.728 --> 06:44.880
Meep, meep.

06:47.479 --> 06:48.795
Why is William
in Brooklyn?

06:48.797 --> 06:50.514
Why is William
in this diner?

06:50.516 --> 06:53.267
Why is every inbred rich guy
named William?

06:53.269 --> 06:56.854
I don't want to see him.

06:58.823 --> 07:00.157
Max, close the door.

07:00.159 --> 07:01.775
I don't want him
to come in here.

07:01.777 --> 07:05.112
Yeah, 'cause that happens
all the time.

07:05.114 --> 07:06.664
Customers come
in the front door

07:06.666 --> 07:08.165
and make a beeline
through the kitchen

07:08.167 --> 07:13.153
to see if there's a waitress
hiding in the walk-in freezer.

07:13.155 --> 07:14.338
Okay, what is the deal?

07:14.340 --> 07:15.589
Tell me fast.

07:15.591 --> 07:18.659
I'm nipping
like crazy in here.

07:18.661 --> 07:22.829
Ooh, you're smuggling some
gumdrops there, too, ice queen.

07:22.831 --> 07:25.216
His name is William Van Horn,
and he's...

07:26.885 --> 07:28.903
I am leaving for sex.

07:28.905 --> 07:32.473
Last chance for threesome,
foursome, possibly fivesome,

07:32.475 --> 07:36.260
if her sister's train
gets in on time.

07:36.262 --> 07:37.444
Oleg, please.

07:37.446 --> 07:39.196
I don't have time
to be harassed right now.

07:39.198 --> 07:40.297
Oh, okay.

07:40.299 --> 07:43.400
I'll see you
and the gumdrops tomorrow.

07:45.203 --> 07:46.453
Story. Go.

07:46.455 --> 07:48.239
We met
at our parents' companies'

07:48.241 --> 07:49.373
parent company picnic.

07:49.375 --> 07:50.958
His family is
the Boston Van Horns...

07:50.960 --> 07:52.042
story.
Stop.

07:52.044 --> 07:53.244
Cut to the end.
Do we hate him?

07:53.246 --> 07:55.529
He dumped me
when I lost all my money...

07:55.531 --> 07:57.665
never called me,
not an email, nothing.

07:57.667 --> 07:59.166
Oh, we hate him.

07:59.168 --> 08:01.418
Wait. Which one's your ex...
the Asian one, the black one?

08:01.420 --> 08:03.971
I'm kidding.
No, seriously.

08:05.924 --> 08:09.643
The white one or the really,
really white one?

08:11.096 --> 08:13.931
Really, really white.

08:13.933 --> 08:16.817
Service, service, service,

08:16.819 --> 08:19.436
service, service, serv...

08:19.438 --> 08:21.188
you heard your bro.
Service him.

08:21.190 --> 08:23.741
Oh, crushed!

08:23.743 --> 08:25.276
Hey, you better be careful,

08:25.278 --> 08:27.027
'cause I can give you a run
for your money.

08:27.029 --> 08:28.329
I don't have any money.

08:28.331 --> 08:30.247
Well, with a body like that,
you don't need any.

08:30.249 --> 08:32.616
- Oh! Ba-bam!

08:32.618 --> 08:34.501
Did you actually think
that was a good line,

08:34.503 --> 08:35.501
or is that what you do

08:35.504 --> 08:37.371
so the check gets paid
by Richie Rich?

08:37.373 --> 08:39.089
Hold on.
Who said I was rich?

08:39.091 --> 08:40.841
- Let me see your Hands.
- What...

08:40.842 --> 08:43.126
looking to see if I have
poor-people calluses?

08:43.129 --> 08:46.647
No, I wanted to see
how big your penis is.

08:48.266 --> 08:50.684
With Hands that size,
you better be rich.

08:50.686 --> 08:53.804
Oh! Shazam!

08:53.806 --> 08:56.440
Not cool, bro.

08:56.442 --> 08:58.642
- What's your name?
- Michelle Obama.

08:58.644 --> 09:00.778
We're closed.

09:00.780 --> 09:03.430
I'm William.
Give me your number.

09:03.432 --> 09:05.449
Why? So you can put it
in your phone

09:05.451 --> 09:07.534
and never call or text
or email?

09:07.536 --> 09:09.036
Seriously.

09:09.038 --> 09:11.238
You wouldn't know what to do
with a good girl if you had one.

09:11.240 --> 09:13.907
But you're not a good girl.
That's why I want your number.

09:13.909 --> 09:15.659
So how about it?

09:15.661 --> 09:17.277
We're closed.

09:17.279 --> 09:18.996
- Your sign says
"open till 2:00."

09:28.423 --> 09:30.841
My, my.

09:30.843 --> 09:33.894
How time does fly.

09:36.798 --> 09:40.100
2:00, gentlemen...
nighty night.

09:42.487 --> 09:44.888
What did I ever do to you?

09:48.860 --> 09:50.327
You didn't mention me,
did you?

09:50.329 --> 09:51.795
Ugh, no.
I just gave him...

09:51.797 --> 09:53.530
just get to the end.
Do you hate him?

09:53.532 --> 09:54.948
I hate him.

09:54.950 --> 09:56.283
That was
the weirdest thing,

09:56.285 --> 09:58.435
seeing him come in here.

09:58.437 --> 10:02.256
No, the weirdest thing
is coming in here right now.

10:04.342 --> 10:06.126
Why no?

10:06.128 --> 10:09.513
Girl at urban outfitter said
it was hip.

10:09.515 --> 10:11.048
You look like a lesbian

10:11.050 --> 10:14.051
I made out with once
on a dare.

10:16.671 --> 10:20.023
Han, you're adorable
exactly as you are.

10:20.025 --> 10:22.976
Why are you trying
to be hip?

10:22.978 --> 10:24.895
To meet girls.

10:24.897 --> 10:28.615
Oh!

10:31.870 --> 10:33.170
It's not that bad in here.

10:33.172 --> 10:34.805
I thought my first trip
to a laundromat

10:34.807 --> 10:36.824
would be
a lot more depressing.

10:50.371 --> 10:52.222
Six years
we spent together,

10:52.224 --> 10:54.975
and now he won't even look
at me.

10:57.712 --> 10:59.346
Oh, not the bag.

10:59.348 --> 11:02.433
I just looked at his bag...
now yours?

11:02.435 --> 11:04.151
Max, it's driving me crazy.

11:04.153 --> 11:06.186
What did you major in
in college?

11:06.188 --> 11:07.855
I majored
in changing topics.

11:07.857 --> 11:09.573
So what did you ever see
in your ex,

11:09.575 --> 11:11.859
the lost Winklevoss twin?

11:11.861 --> 11:13.894
We're not talking
about William.

11:13.896 --> 11:15.562
We're talking
about your bills.

11:15.564 --> 11:17.114
Well, I'm talking
about your Bill!

11:17.116 --> 11:19.716
Oh, face!
Max...

11:19.718 --> 11:21.368
We're trying to start
a cupcake business.

11:21.370 --> 11:23.537
And I can't believe
I'm about to say this

11:23.539 --> 11:25.923
but with my father's
financial baggage,

11:25.925 --> 11:27.624
you're our best chance
for credit.

11:27.626 --> 11:30.076
Listen, everybody's broke
in their 20s.

11:30.078 --> 11:31.879
And everybody hides
from stuff.

11:31.881 --> 11:33.130
You run into freezers.

11:33.132 --> 11:35.632
I practice ignorance
and blackout drinking.

11:40.772 --> 11:42.422
What's happening right now?

11:42.424 --> 11:45.392
<i>Hola, dudarinos.</i>

11:45.394 --> 11:47.561
The laundromat's
closing early.

11:47.563 --> 11:51.315
We've rented it out
for our '80s pop-up disco party.

11:51.317 --> 11:54.267
Bobby.

11:54.269 --> 11:57.070
- Shouldn't it be called
an "'80s pop-up lame hipster

11:57.072 --> 11:59.957
will do anything
to be ironic and lame" party?

11:59.959 --> 12:01.074
"Lame"?

12:01.076 --> 12:02.943
Don't think so.

12:02.945 --> 12:04.378
What?

12:04.380 --> 12:06.129
<i>Vicki from small wonder
is coming?</i>

12:06.131 --> 12:07.280
Oh!

12:07.282 --> 12:09.416
Embarrassed to be you
right now.

12:09.418 --> 12:13.387
Unless you chicks have
75 disco-lovin' bucks,

12:13.389 --> 12:15.088
be gone in ten minutes,

12:15.090 --> 12:17.307
or my man here
will throw you out.

12:17.309 --> 12:19.510
Don't let his tube top
fool you.

12:19.512 --> 12:22.563
Bobby is mad wiry.

12:22.565 --> 12:24.097
I'm wiry.

12:29.020 --> 12:30.136
<i>Small wonder?</i>

12:30.138 --> 12:31.989
Is that the show on TLC

12:31.991 --> 12:34.024
about the little-people
magicians?

12:34.026 --> 12:35.475
No.

12:35.477 --> 12:38.245
It's an '80s sitcom
about this little girl robot

12:38.247 --> 12:39.980
who lives
with a loving family.

12:39.982 --> 12:41.582
A girl robot?

12:41.584 --> 12:43.200
That's totally unbelievable.

12:43.202 --> 12:45.619
No,
that's totally awesome!

12:45.621 --> 12:49.006
The unbelievable part
is the loving family.

12:49.008 --> 12:50.340
I love Vicki.

12:50.342 --> 12:52.376
She had no
emotions and was empty inside.

12:52.378 --> 12:54.378
My role model! We're staying.

12:54.380 --> 12:56.997
$75?
To do what...

12:56.999 --> 12:58.832
stand here
and dance next to...

12:58.834 --> 13:01.552
Guy-girl and girl-guy
over there?

13:06.357 --> 13:07.608
Come on, Chestnut,

13:07.610 --> 13:10.176
go poo-poo
near the hipsters.

13:10.178 --> 13:11.228
Hey, how cool would it be
if we could get

13:11.230 --> 13:13.363
<i>Chess to go poo
on a hipster?</i>

13:13.365 --> 13:15.115
How can
all of those people

13:15.117 --> 13:18.902
have $75 just to dance
at a laundromat?

13:18.904 --> 13:20.537
I've been doing my roots
with white-out.

13:20.539 --> 13:23.457
Hipsters in Williamsburg
will pay for anything

13:23.459 --> 13:25.742
if it makes them feel like
they're in on something new

13:25.744 --> 13:27.160
no one else knows about.

13:27.162 --> 13:28.629
All you need's a gimmick.

13:28.631 --> 13:29.746
Dudes!

13:29.748 --> 13:31.281
Can we ride your horse?

13:31.283 --> 13:32.883
Sure.
100 bucks.

13:32.885 --> 13:34.835
Okay.
I got to go to the ATM.

13:34.837 --> 13:37.888
Wait. Stay right there.
We'll be right back.

13:37.890 --> 13:39.256
Oh, my God.

13:39.258 --> 13:41.875
Max, we are literally looking
our gift horse in the mouth.

13:41.877 --> 13:44.511
We have something that's better
than an '80s disco party.

13:44.513 --> 13:45.395
We have a horse.

13:45.397 --> 13:47.147
If we throw
a big enough party,

13:47.149 --> 13:48.815
charge hipsters
for horse rides,

13:48.817 --> 13:50.567
we could pay off
your student loan!

13:50.569 --> 13:52.569
You'd whore out Chestnut
like that?

13:52.571 --> 13:54.521
Don't you have to get him
hooked on heroin first?

13:54.523 --> 13:56.189
Max, I've got this.

13:56.191 --> 13:57.908
I'm a brilliant event planner.

13:57.910 --> 14:00.277
My sweet 16
was off the chain...

14:00.279 --> 14:02.329
penthouse party,
pink and black theme.

14:02.331 --> 14:05.165
<i>Alanis Morissette sang songs
from jagged little pill.</i>

14:05.167 --> 14:06.617
On my 16th birthday,

14:06.619 --> 14:08.735
my mom took too many
jagged little pills,

14:08.737 --> 14:10.370
and I had to drive her
to the emergency room

14:10.372 --> 14:11.955
to get her stomach pumped.

14:11.957 --> 14:15.709
<i>Was your childhood based
on the novel Push by Sapphire?</i>

14:15.711 --> 14:18.178
I wish!

14:20.131 --> 14:22.716
The theme is
'90s horse party.

14:22.718 --> 14:24.384
It's exactly the kind
of hip event

14:24.386 --> 14:25.602
you're dying to be a part of.

14:25.604 --> 14:27.054
It would happen
after closing,

14:27.056 --> 14:28.355
so it won't affect business.

14:28.357 --> 14:29.890
And all the horse rides
will take place out back.

14:29.892 --> 14:32.109
So no damage will come
to the diner.

14:32.111 --> 14:34.761
But why would I say yes
to giving up my diner

14:34.763 --> 14:36.363
for no cash return?

14:36.365 --> 14:38.231
You might get laid.

14:43.187 --> 14:44.621
Great!

14:44.623 --> 14:46.957
The '90s horse party
is happening on Thursday.

14:46.959 --> 14:48.742
Fantastic.
Any other questions?

14:48.744 --> 14:49.743
Yes.

14:49.745 --> 14:51.745
What exactly is possibility

14:51.747 --> 14:54.614
of percentage of me...

14:54.616 --> 14:56.133
Getting laid?

14:58.670 --> 14:59.886
All I can say is,

14:59.888 --> 15:02.139
with the cute
'90s-themed-clothing incentive

15:02.141 --> 15:03.623
and the trivia contest,

15:03.625 --> 15:06.560
lots of cute hipster girls
will be here looking to...

15:06.562 --> 15:08.395
Get laid!

15:09.764 --> 15:11.431
I will go now
and start to research

15:11.433 --> 15:14.467
American trivia facts
about the 1990s.

15:16.571 --> 15:18.471
You realize we're gonna have
to give him something...

15:18.473 --> 15:19.990
like flash a little boob,
something.

15:19.992 --> 15:22.526
I feel like Han's
more of an ass man.

15:22.528 --> 15:25.478
Good point... 'cause his head
is right there.

15:30.617 --> 15:32.485
♪ Creep ♪

15:32.487 --> 15:35.488
♪ oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I,
yeah ♪

15:35.490 --> 15:37.907
♪ creep,
oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I ♪

15:37.909 --> 15:39.125
Oleg, what's up?

15:39.127 --> 15:40.877
Not enjoying
the '90s horse party?

15:40.879 --> 15:44.663
I thought you said
"'90s whores party."

15:46.166 --> 15:50.436
Now I'm wearing girdle
and deodorant for no reason.

15:52.356 --> 15:53.723
Quite a turnout, Max.

15:53.725 --> 15:56.526
Reminds me of the after-hours
clubs I used to go to,

15:56.528 --> 15:58.811
you know, if all
the cool cats shooting dope

15:58.813 --> 16:02.348
were replaced by sad,
white fools sipping light beer.

16:04.768 --> 16:06.018
Look!

16:06.020 --> 16:09.405
I did research and make myself
a 1990s trivia t-shirt.

16:09.407 --> 16:11.741
"Talk to the Han."

16:11.743 --> 16:12.909
Get it?

16:12.911 --> 16:15.128
"Talk to the Han!"

16:17.581 --> 16:19.048
That actually is cool.

16:19.050 --> 16:22.251
I am hoping
it will help me...

16:22.253 --> 16:23.669
Get laid?

16:26.006 --> 16:28.624
Care to purchase
a tamagotchi

16:28.626 --> 16:31.210
or a 90210-reo cupcake?

16:31.212 --> 16:35.014
We came here wanting
to hate on you chicks hard.

16:35.016 --> 16:39.735
But that horse you got
out back is mad cool.

16:39.737 --> 16:41.437
You bested us,
party beast.

16:41.439 --> 16:45.158
And to that,
I doff my cap.

16:46.193 --> 16:48.727
- How much are the cupcakes?
- $10 each.

16:48.729 --> 16:52.865
Ooh, I doff my cap again,
milady.

16:52.867 --> 16:54.900
Max, look at all this.

16:54.902 --> 16:56.169
We're a success!

16:56.171 --> 16:57.753
I'll tell you
what's not a success...

16:57.755 --> 16:59.505
the plan to get Han
some action.

16:59.507 --> 17:01.207
Look at him over there.

17:07.347 --> 17:09.882
- That's so sad.
- I know.

17:09.884 --> 17:12.718
Go over there
and give him a "Han" job.

17:14.972 --> 17:19.025
William!

17:19.027 --> 17:22.028
Meep, meep.

17:27.034 --> 17:31.704
You realize this is a freezer,
not a panic room, right?

17:31.706 --> 17:32.938
Just go out there

17:32.940 --> 17:35.274
and tear his smug, white ass
a new one.

17:35.276 --> 17:36.626
I can't face him, Max.

17:36.628 --> 17:39.278
Why? He's the one
who didn't call you.

17:39.280 --> 17:41.947
I can't face him
because I'm a waitress.

17:41.949 --> 17:42.915
Last time he saw me,

17:42.917 --> 17:44.800
I was a billionaire
in a townhouse.

17:44.802 --> 17:47.587
Now I'm a waitress
in a walk-in freezer.

17:47.589 --> 17:50.423
So, when you were laying
around on your trust fund,

17:50.425 --> 17:51.424
doing nothing every day,

17:51.426 --> 17:53.176
having other people
scrub your toilet,

17:53.178 --> 17:54.627
you could hold your head
up high?

17:54.629 --> 17:55.961
But now
that you support yourself

17:55.963 --> 17:58.231
by earning your own money,
that's somehow shameful?

17:58.233 --> 17:59.565
Who cares what he thinks?

17:59.567 --> 18:04.237
He is the guy who just paid $100
to party with a horse.

18:05.639 --> 18:07.406
He's the loser, not you.

18:07.408 --> 18:09.358
Really? 'Cause he's
out there having fun,

18:09.360 --> 18:10.359
and I'm in here,

18:10.361 --> 18:13.746
hugging a tub
of expired blue cheese.

18:13.748 --> 18:15.981
Look...

18:15.983 --> 18:18.201
You see that wad
of cash in your Hand?

18:18.203 --> 18:20.203
You earned that.

18:20.205 --> 18:22.121
Slap that wad in your palm
a few times!

18:22.123 --> 18:23.589
Feel its power.

18:25.759 --> 18:27.093
That's all you got?

18:27.095 --> 18:29.212
Come on,
really squeeze that wad!

18:29.214 --> 18:30.663
Feels good
in your Hands, right?

18:30.665 --> 18:32.831
- Feels pretty good.
- Yeah.

18:32.833 --> 18:36.102
Now slap it and say,
"this is my wad!"

18:36.104 --> 18:38.638
This is my wad.

18:38.640 --> 18:41.390
<i>This is my wad!</i>

18:41.392 --> 18:43.842
<i>This is my wad!</i>

18:43.844 --> 18:45.144
Go out there.

18:45.146 --> 18:47.797
I'm going out there!

18:47.799 --> 18:49.815
As soon as the ladies
calm down.

18:49.817 --> 18:51.117
Are you kidding?

18:51.119 --> 18:54.203
Show him what he's missing.
Let 'em pop, playa!

18:57.658 --> 18:59.575
Where are you,
you rich poseur?

18:59.577 --> 19:01.077
Oh! Uh...

19:01.079 --> 19:02.411
Listen up!

19:02.413 --> 19:05.881
That was meant exclusively
for one specific rich poseur.

19:05.883 --> 19:08.200
All you other rich poseurs,

19:08.202 --> 19:09.719
just continue
with the '90s!

19:09.721 --> 19:11.804
Whoop, whoop!

19:11.806 --> 19:14.056
Where is he?
Do you see him?

19:14.058 --> 19:16.259
Uh, no.
He was right over there.

19:16.261 --> 19:17.677
He's gone.

19:17.679 --> 19:19.595
I don't get to shove this
in his face.

19:19.597 --> 19:21.364
It would've been nice
to put my wad

19:21.366 --> 19:24.850
in his face
for a change.

19:29.356 --> 19:33.276
Oh, speaking of wads,
look over there.

19:33.278 --> 19:37.229
Aw.

19:37.231 --> 19:39.915
He's such a little pimp.

19:39.917 --> 19:42.001
Are you okay?

19:42.003 --> 19:44.003
Yeah.
Actually, I am.

19:44.005 --> 19:45.454
I guess I didn't need
to go over there

19:45.456 --> 19:46.905
and make some big,
dramatic speech,

19:46.907 --> 19:48.708
telling him
that even though I'm a waitress,

19:48.710 --> 19:49.908
I'm better than him.

19:49.910 --> 19:52.762
I know that now.
Thank you.

19:52.764 --> 19:55.464
And when I see him
one day in the future,

19:55.466 --> 19:58.584
I'll be happy
to tell him that.

19:58.586 --> 20:00.052
He just came
out of the men's room.

20:00.054 --> 20:01.220
Let's get out of here!

20:01.222 --> 20:02.471
What? I thought
you wanted to talk to him!

20:02.473 --> 20:04.440
I said, "the future."
This is the '90s.

20:04.442 --> 20:07.643
Let's get out of here.
Run!

20:10.480 --> 20:13.032
Feels good running away
from your bill, huh?

20:13.034 --> 20:14.283
So great.

20:14.285 --> 20:15.951
See, that's what
I've been saying.

20:15.953 --> 20:17.737
Well, at least
you don't have to run

20:17.739 --> 20:19.155
from your student loan bill.

20:19.157 --> 20:21.957
We can pay that off and still
have $50 for the cupcake fund.

20:21.959 --> 20:23.576
I hate that college won.

20:23.578 --> 20:25.494
Didn't you get anything
out of it?

20:25.496 --> 20:27.546
You mean, besides mono
and an art teacher

20:27.548 --> 20:28.881
whose idea
of finger-painting

20:28.883 --> 20:32.385
was a little more "finger"
than "painting"?

20:32.387 --> 20:33.419
Art teacher?

20:33.421 --> 20:35.788
Max, was that your major... art?

20:35.790 --> 20:38.841
Keep your eyes on the road.
You're driving.

20:38.843 --> 20:40.176
I just thought
for, like, a second,

20:40.178 --> 20:43.312
I could maybe illustrate
children's books.

20:43.314 --> 20:45.964
Max, that's so sweet.

20:45.966 --> 20:48.684
You're not like Vicki at all.

20:48.686 --> 20:51.020
Max, look.
Han!

20:51.022 --> 20:52.988
Aw, our little
somethin'-somethin'

20:52.990 --> 20:55.074
got him a little
somethin'-somethin'!

20:55.076 --> 20:57.777
I doff my cap, milady!
