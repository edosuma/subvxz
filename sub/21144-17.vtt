00:01.744 --> 00:02.726
Hi, guys! Today we are doing

00:02.728 --> 00:04.003
"Balloon Drop Pop."

00:04.079 --> 00:06.730
Where a bunch of balloons
are gonna fall,

00:06.732 --> 00:08.210
and we're each gonna try
and grab the balloon

00:08.234 --> 00:10.067
that matches the color
we're wearing.

00:10.069 --> 00:11.510
Then, put it in our basket.

00:11.587 --> 00:14.513
You can also pop any color
balloon that isn't yours.

00:14.590 --> 00:17.241
The person with the most
balloons in their basket

00:17.243 --> 00:18.833
at the end of the game wins.

00:18.911 --> 00:20.244
Drop the balloons!

00:20.246 --> 00:23.263
(all shouting)

00:25.601 --> 00:26.750
Yes!

00:26.752 --> 00:27.752
(balloons popping)

00:33.592 --> 00:34.608
(screaming)

00:34.684 --> 00:35.684
Uhh!

00:39.098 --> 00:40.539
Dirk: Hey!

00:40.616 --> 00:43.283
(balloons popping)

00:46.363 --> 00:47.932
Well, uh, I think
these two definitely lost.

00:47.956 --> 00:50.607
- It's his fault, no, it's their fault.
- We would've won...

00:50.609 --> 00:52.459
How could it be,
we had a three-way tie?

00:52.536 --> 00:54.202
Great job, guys.

00:54.280 --> 00:55.946
- Girl power.
- Whoo, whoo, whoo!

00:55.948 --> 00:57.108
Thanks for watchin'
"Balloon Drop Pop".

00:57.132 --> 00:58.891
Hope you guys enjoyed.

00:58.967 --> 01:02.544

01:55.507 --> 01:57.765
Well, team...
we built the Parthenon.

01:57.843 --> 01:59.934
And only a week past
the due date.

02:00.012 --> 02:01.620
Partial credit high-five?

02:01.697 --> 02:05.365
Paige/Frankie: C-minus!

02:05.442 --> 02:07.522
Well, I think we've earned
ourselves a burrito break.

02:10.280 --> 02:12.131
Bernard, is that hot sauce?

02:12.207 --> 02:14.040
Uhh, it's Paige's!

02:14.117 --> 02:15.876
It's only mildly hot.

02:15.952 --> 02:19.029
Wait... Why am I nervous
about this?

02:19.031 --> 02:21.306
Every time he uses hot sauce
he rubs his eyes,

02:21.383 --> 02:22.199
runs around screaming,

02:22.201 --> 02:23.475
and slams into the walls.

02:23.552 --> 02:27.053
Then I have to figure out
if the carpet's stained

02:27.130 --> 02:28.480
with hot sauce or blood.

02:28.557 --> 02:29.964
Just do the lick test.

02:30.042 --> 02:31.433
I'm not doin' the lick test!

02:34.213 --> 02:35.540
Speaking of stains,
you were supposed

02:35.564 --> 02:36.804
to clean the bathroom floor.

02:36.882 --> 02:39.307
If I'd known
about his aiming issues,

02:39.385 --> 02:40.826
I woulda got yellow tiles.

02:40.903 --> 02:41.660
Frankie/Paige: Eww!

02:41.737 --> 02:42.737
Grandma!

02:44.907 --> 02:47.499
My house, my rules.
If you don't like 'em,

02:47.576 --> 02:49.001
you can find
somewhere else to live.

02:49.077 --> 02:52.654
Oh, man, I have to go
to the bathroom,

02:52.731 --> 02:54.748
but I don't wanna go
somewhere that disgusting.

02:54.824 --> 02:57.292
I'm gonna go use that abandoned
porta-potty in the alley.

03:01.407 --> 03:04.424
Grandma: And stop
eating the toothpaste!

03:04.501 --> 03:06.801
Stop buying
all the delicious flavors!

03:09.081 --> 03:10.081
Man, this stinks.

03:11.583 --> 03:12.858
Where's Paige?

03:12.935 --> 03:15.602
- Oh, she left.
- Bummer.

03:15.679 --> 03:17.199
I could really
use a friend to talk to.

03:18.757 --> 03:19.531
What do you mean?

03:19.608 --> 03:21.366
I'm here.

03:21.443 --> 03:24.519
Yeah...
this isn't really your thing.

03:24.596 --> 03:25.924
I go to Paige when I need
helpful life advice.

03:25.948 --> 03:28.432
I go to you if I need
a snarky comment,

03:28.434 --> 03:31.210
or... something with glasses.

03:33.105 --> 03:35.029
Ay! I'm a good friend!

03:35.107 --> 03:36.107
Tell me what's wrong.

03:38.277 --> 03:41.220
It's Grandma. She never lets up!

03:41.296 --> 03:43.947
She treats me like I'm a baby.

03:43.949 --> 03:46.391
Sorry if I'm a little cranky,
I haven't had my juice yet.

03:48.454 --> 03:50.229
(slurping noise)

03:54.309 --> 03:56.902
All right.
Helpful friend advice.

03:56.979 --> 03:57.979
I can do this.

04:00.132 --> 04:02.232
What if you...
stood up to Grandma?

04:03.727 --> 04:05.318
I can do that?

04:05.395 --> 04:06.894
Yeah.
You're not a little kid anymore,

04:06.972 --> 04:09.731
you're 15. You're almost a man!

04:09.808 --> 04:12.233
Yeah, you know?
I found a chest hair today.

04:12.311 --> 04:12.993
- Oh.
- It's either Dirk's or Grandma's,

04:13.069 --> 04:14.419
but, I did find it.

04:18.667 --> 04:20.484
Ahhh!

04:20.486 --> 04:23.320
Why are you so excited?

04:23.322 --> 04:25.764
Is there some kind
of sea otter parade today?

04:25.841 --> 04:28.717
No! That's next
month in Vancouver.

04:31.330 --> 04:33.830
Jessie Grant is coming
to Vuuugle to film a video!

04:33.832 --> 04:35.440
Who? Never heard of her.

04:35.517 --> 04:39.611
Are you serious? She's awesome,
she's a total weirdball

04:39.688 --> 04:40.946
who sings quirky songs.

04:41.023 --> 04:42.023
Here, watch.

04:43.842 --> 04:45.433
♪ Nobody knows
that I can't play piano ♪

04:45.511 --> 04:49.437
♪ It looks so flawless
when I play these keys ♪

04:49.515 --> 04:52.015
♪ My singing is great You
can't tell I'm lip synching ♪

04:52.017 --> 04:55.852
♪ Now watch me play
this beautiful song ♪

04:55.854 --> 04:58.297
(elephant trumpeting,
explosions, a-ooga horns)

05:02.544 --> 05:04.303
- Hi!
- Ahh! Jessie Grant!

05:04.379 --> 05:07.547
I love you! Do I? I don't know!
What? (Screams)

05:08.717 --> 05:10.458
Wow!

05:10.536 --> 05:12.385
It's always nice to meet fans.

05:12.462 --> 05:17.140
Oh, I'm not a fan.
I find you... off-putting.

05:19.211 --> 05:20.688
You're funny.
Do you want an autograph?

05:20.712 --> 05:22.821
Sure. Do you know anyone famous?

05:22.898 --> 05:23.989
(laughs)

05:25.717 --> 05:26.883
I'll take that as a no.

05:26.885 --> 05:28.810
(laughs)

05:28.887 --> 05:31.446
I'll take an autograph.
You can sign my face!

05:33.909 --> 05:35.000
I'm sorry. That was weird.

05:36.653 --> 05:38.486
You can sign my face.

05:38.564 --> 05:42.490
Tempting, but I actually
have to set up for auditions.

05:42.568 --> 05:46.236
I'm picking one Vuuugler
to co-star in my video.

05:46.238 --> 05:48.013
Co-star in your video?

05:48.090 --> 05:51.683
I mean, cool. Cool, cool. Are you
looking for songs or jokes, or...

05:51.760 --> 05:54.168
Ah, cool, cool, you're
walking away from me now.

05:54.246 --> 05:56.596
Well, see you soon!

05:56.673 --> 05:58.598
But not if you see me first!

05:58.675 --> 06:02.527
(laughs) Oh.
Well, that went well.

06:08.443 --> 06:11.111
Bernard, did you eat my bananas?

06:11.187 --> 06:13.067
You know you're not allowed
to eat pointy fruit.

06:15.450 --> 06:16.744
(thinking)
Remember what Frankie said.

06:16.768 --> 06:18.451
You don't have to take this.

06:18.528 --> 06:23.456
You know what, Grandma? I'm sick
of you treating me like a baby.

06:23.533 --> 06:27.535
Excuse me? I do not like
your tone, young man.

06:27.613 --> 06:29.871
Oh no, you guys are fighting
during movie night?

06:29.948 --> 06:30.948
Both: Yes!

06:32.801 --> 06:34.441
Well, I guess I'm watchin'
this movie now.

06:36.455 --> 06:38.397
I'm tired of how strict you are.

06:38.473 --> 06:41.233
I've said it before,
my house, my rules.

06:41.309 --> 06:44.144
Mm-hm, she has said that.

06:44.220 --> 06:47.572
If you don't like 'em, you can
find somewhere else to live.

06:47.649 --> 06:50.725
Maybe I will.

06:50.802 --> 06:54.487
I really have to go to the bathroom,
but I don't wanna miss anything!

06:56.158 --> 06:58.475
Bernard, close that door.

06:58.477 --> 07:01.420
Close the door. Close the door!

07:01.496 --> 07:05.498
Bernard Miriam Shotz. If you leave this
house, there will be consequences!

07:08.320 --> 07:10.336
(gasp) -(whispers) Consequences.

07:14.509 --> 07:17.269
- (phone rings)
- Hey, Bernie.

07:17.345 --> 07:21.681
Hey, Frankie, great news. I took
your advice. I stood up to Grandma,

07:21.758 --> 07:23.442
and I feel like
my entire life changed.

07:23.518 --> 07:26.186
You see! I can be a good friend.

07:26.262 --> 07:30.115
From now on, when you need help,
you come to Frankie Wong.

07:30.192 --> 07:31.616
Great! Because I ran
away from home,

07:31.693 --> 07:34.027
I have nowhere to stay, and
I'm right outside your door.

07:34.103 --> 07:35.287
What?

07:38.942 --> 07:41.960
Hey, hey, roomie, what's the
juice box sitch up in here?

07:46.875 --> 07:47.966
What's up, guys? I'm Paige.

07:48.043 --> 07:49.192
I'm Frankie.

07:49.194 --> 07:50.860
Both: And we're Bizaardvark.

07:50.862 --> 07:52.023
Today, we're going to make
our favorite dessert,

07:52.047 --> 07:53.287
chocolate chip cookies!

07:53.365 --> 07:56.032
We have everything we need
except the recipe.

07:56.034 --> 07:57.217
We are going to do our best.

07:57.293 --> 07:58.551
It could be delicious.

07:58.628 --> 07:59.978
Could be terrible.

08:00.055 --> 08:02.055
Yeah, just like life.

08:02.131 --> 08:03.482
That's deep, man.

08:03.558 --> 08:05.611
- I'm gonna start with the dry ingredients.
- All right.

08:05.635 --> 08:06.876
I'm gonna start
with the wet ingredients.

08:06.878 --> 08:08.022
- So I'm gonna put... Ooh.
- I'm gonna do butter.

08:08.046 --> 08:09.488
What is this?
This is a cup, I think.

08:09.564 --> 08:11.617
- Gonna use the sugar?
- It's gonna be a little too sugary.

08:11.641 --> 08:13.733
- I can feel it in my bones.
- That's not a thing.

08:13.810 --> 08:15.218
- Ahh!
- (laughing)

08:15.220 --> 08:16.161
Ahh!

08:16.238 --> 08:17.887
Ahh!

08:17.889 --> 08:19.222
Ahh! Ahh! No, you have to...

08:19.224 --> 08:20.223
Ahh! (Laughs)

08:20.225 --> 08:21.225
(laughing)

08:24.988 --> 08:27.839
(both laughing)

08:27.916 --> 08:29.490
I feel like I did a great job.

08:29.568 --> 08:30.083
I feel like
I did a great job, too.

08:30.159 --> 08:31.993
Now let's bake 'em!

08:32.070 --> 08:33.564
- (timer dings)
- Let's see how they turned out.

08:33.588 --> 08:36.330
- (both gasping)
- Ohh!

08:36.408 --> 08:37.832
- Oh my god!
- (screams)

08:37.909 --> 08:39.017
(laughing)

08:40.746 --> 08:43.263
- Yours look so better.
- Mine are literally perfect.

08:43.339 --> 08:44.748
Look at them.

08:44.750 --> 08:46.507
- What is this?
- (laughing)

08:46.585 --> 08:48.360
- All right.
- (laughing)

08:48.436 --> 08:49.852
- (crunch)
- Mmm...

08:51.773 --> 08:53.606
(laughing)

08:56.778 --> 08:58.778
Ooh, my gosh,
there's so many pointy fruit!

09:01.266 --> 09:02.657
And so many hot sauces!

09:05.937 --> 09:07.006
Dad, I don't know what happened.

09:07.030 --> 09:09.939
I... I told him to stand up
for himself,

09:09.941 --> 09:11.102
but I... I didn't think
he'd run away from home.

09:11.126 --> 09:13.793
I... I... I thought he was
smarter than that.

09:13.870 --> 09:16.462
Bernie: Ahh! I got hot
sauce in my eyes!

09:19.117 --> 09:20.853
Well, I just got off
the phone with his grandma,

09:20.877 --> 09:22.710
and I told her he's here
and he's safe.

09:22.788 --> 09:25.388
Ahh! I stabbed myself
with a pointy fruit!

09:28.960 --> 09:31.628
So, what are your plans
for getting out of this?

09:31.630 --> 09:33.797
- What do you mean?
- Frankie, I love you.

09:33.799 --> 09:36.816
But, when it comes to helping
others, you're really good...

09:38.637 --> 09:39.803
at asking Paige to handle it.

09:39.805 --> 09:43.823
First of all,
I resent that comedic pause.

09:43.900 --> 09:45.825
And why does everyone
think that about me?

09:45.902 --> 09:46.751
I care about Bernie.

09:46.828 --> 09:47.977
I'm a good friend.

09:47.979 --> 09:52.073
Ahh! I put the hot
sauce on the fruit,

09:52.150 --> 09:53.925
- and now they're both in my eyes!
- (crash)

09:59.324 --> 10:02.008
- Uhh...
- Bernie? I'm here for you.

10:02.085 --> 10:04.269
I'm gonna help you
through this tough time.

10:04.346 --> 10:06.438
You can stay as long
as you want.

10:06.514 --> 10:08.422
Frankie? Is that you?

10:08.500 --> 10:11.559
I'm hearing Paige's words
but it's your voice.

10:14.189 --> 10:16.506
This... is gonna be a mess.

Not good. -(Sighs)
You're not the only one.

11:23.742 --> 11:25.644
Dirk told me Bernie leaving
has been rough for him, too.

11:25.668 --> 11:26.843

11:49.768 --> 11:52.526
I can do that?

11:52.604 --> 11:53.286
I... I don't know, Frankie, I
really gotta focus on my audition

Ooh! I'm next!

11:56.624 --> 11:59.108
Should I tell Jessie how much
I love her before I audition,

11:59.110 --> 12:01.052
or after? Or both?
Both might be best.

12:01.129 --> 12:03.107
Paige, don't come on too strong,
you'll freak Jessie out,

12:03.131 --> 12:07.208
and make her wanna leave
and never come back.

12:07.285 --> 12:08.885

He's got one bit,
but man, it's good.

12:17.553 --> 12:22.298
No, if I come on too strong and pretend I
have a crush on Bernie, it'll weird him out

12:22.300 --> 12:23.633
and... and he'll wanna
go back home.

12:23.635 --> 12:25.726
That's a good friend thing
to do, right?

12:25.804 --> 12:26.911
- Paige Olvera?
- Yes!

12:26.988 --> 12:28.388
That's all I needed
to hear, thanks!

12:30.566 --> 12:34.477

13:12.851 --> 13:15.685
Hey, funny girl from yesterday.

13:15.687 --> 13:16.807
Do you wanna be in my video?

13:16.871 --> 13:18.946
Amelia/Paige: What?

you're gonna take me, too.

We're a package deal.

13:33.296 --> 13:35.705
No, we're not.

13:35.707 --> 13:39.967
We're a package... deal.

13:40.045 --> 13:41.394
Oh, wow, I love this chemistry.

13:41.470 --> 13:43.046
You're both in.

13:43.048 --> 13:44.048
See you tomorrow.

13:45.550 --> 13:48.551
This is actually happening!

13:48.553 --> 13:49.643
Aren't you so excited?

13:49.721 --> 13:51.329
Say yes!

13:51.406 --> 13:52.655
Yes?

13:57.745 --> 14:01.005
Frankie, where do you guys
keep the... Whoa.

14:01.082 --> 14:02.162
Is that a candlelit dinner?

14:03.234 --> 14:06.252
It is... darling.

14:10.166 --> 14:13.910
Bernie, having you here
the past few days

14:13.912 --> 14:17.246
has made me see you differently.

14:17.248 --> 14:19.140
Man, this is good!
Can I have some of yours?

14:22.103 --> 14:25.363
Eat all you want.
I like a man who's... hungry.

14:28.851 --> 14:30.535
Uhhh, Frankie?

14:30.612 --> 14:32.704
Is everything okay?

14:32.780 --> 14:36.708
Why? Am I making you...
uncomfortable?

14:38.770 --> 14:40.005
No, your eyes are just
real blinky.

14:40.029 --> 14:41.437
It's gross.

14:41.439 --> 14:42.439
Maybe see an optometrist?

14:45.110 --> 14:48.127
Bernie, I want us to be
more than friends.

14:49.948 --> 14:51.047
Serious friends.

14:52.634 --> 14:54.342
(whispers) Mi amor.

14:56.788 --> 14:58.804
Yes. Me would love some more.

14:58.881 --> 15:00.056
Bernie, I want you out!

15:01.960 --> 15:05.403
Of... Of my... Of my mind.

15:05.480 --> 15:08.814
Because I can't stop
thinking about you.

15:08.891 --> 15:11.558
Wait... this is weird.

15:11.636 --> 15:13.819
Are you trying
to get me to leave?

15:13.896 --> 15:15.580
No! Y... You're the
man of my dreams.

15:15.657 --> 15:20.251
All right, well, if I'm the man of
your dreams, then we should kiss.

15:21.980 --> 15:23.537
On the lips.

15:25.483 --> 15:30.086
Well, you're in luck. 'Cause
that's where I'm gonna kiss ya.

15:37.495 --> 15:39.162
No, I can't do this!

15:39.164 --> 15:40.232
I knew it!
You just want me gone.

15:40.256 --> 15:42.589
Fine! I tried to be supportive,

15:42.667 --> 15:44.333
but having you here
is just too much.

15:44.335 --> 15:47.853
Well, I'm not going home. But I'm
definitely not staying here.

15:49.765 --> 15:51.023
You're a bad friend, Frankie.

15:58.349 --> 16:02.201
And by the way, you and me... I
think we should see other people.

16:08.042 --> 16:09.353
Hey, guys, I'm Bernie,
and this is...

16:09.377 --> 16:10.284
Don't say our names!

16:10.361 --> 16:12.528
We're on a mission.

16:12.530 --> 16:14.380
Sorry, Agent Dirk.

16:14.457 --> 16:16.307
So we must maneuver
through these lasers

16:16.384 --> 16:19.644
in order to retrieve the most
sought after jelly beans

16:19.721 --> 16:20.645
in the world.

16:20.722 --> 16:22.555
- Here we go!
- Okay.

16:22.631 --> 16:24.473
This is where your size
comes to good use.

16:27.729 --> 16:29.803
- It's a no-go over here.
- Ahh!

16:29.881 --> 16:31.380
Ahh! Ahh, they've got your leg!

16:31.382 --> 16:33.733
Warrior pose!

16:33.809 --> 16:34.826
Dirk jump!

16:34.902 --> 16:36.552
Ooh, ooh, ooh!

16:36.554 --> 16:38.904
(yelps)

16:38.981 --> 16:39.739
Dirk: Karate kid!

16:39.815 --> 16:41.907
Aah! Aw.

16:41.984 --> 16:43.053
Why am I better
at this than you?

16:43.077 --> 16:45.394
- I'm getting up!
- You're half my size!

16:45.396 --> 16:48.564
- Yes!
- We got 'em!

16:48.566 --> 16:49.846
- We got the jelly beans!
- Yeah!

16:49.901 --> 16:50.657
Dirk: Let's go celebrate!

16:50.735 --> 16:52.235
Whoo!

16:52.237 --> 16:53.237
(alarm going off)

16:55.256 --> 16:56.997
I'll save you!

16:57.075 --> 17:00.184
- Ahh-ahh!
- We gotta go!

17:07.676 --> 17:09.360
Dirk! Have you seen Bernie?

17:09.437 --> 17:11.437
He stormed out of my house
last night.

17:11.514 --> 17:14.794
Look... as his best friend, I don't think
I should be talking to his ex-girlfriend.

17:16.944 --> 17:19.095
I was faking the whole thing.

17:19.097 --> 17:20.257
Yeah. He said you'd say that.

17:22.950 --> 17:26.210
He spent the whole night in the Dare
Lair, if you wanna go apologize.

17:28.122 --> 17:30.039
I'm rootin' for you two!

17:32.201 --> 17:34.218
Yeah, everything's
great, Grandma.

17:34.295 --> 17:36.295
I've been bouncin' around
since I left.

17:36.372 --> 17:41.951
Hung out at Frankie's place, and last night
I slept in Dirk's cannon over there.

17:41.953 --> 17:43.614
Oh! You got a little somethin'
on your face.

17:43.638 --> 17:44.638
Lemme get it.

17:46.474 --> 17:50.643
- Bernie, what are you doing?
- Umm, nothing. Nothing.

17:50.719 --> 17:53.796
Just dressing up Punching Bag Man
like Grandma to work out my feelings,

17:53.798 --> 17:55.064
because I miss her so much.

17:56.651 --> 17:57.651
Agh, I said it all.

18:00.062 --> 18:02.246
What do you care, anyway?

18:02.323 --> 18:04.640
Bernie, I'm sorry
for what I did.

18:04.642 --> 18:07.076
I... I... I wanted to be a good
friend, but I... I messed up.

18:09.147 --> 18:10.088
Is it true what you said
about Grandma?

18:10.164 --> 18:11.255
You really miss her?

18:12.667 --> 18:14.741
Yeah.

18:14.819 --> 18:16.221
Then why don't you go home
and tell her?

18:16.245 --> 18:17.320
No way!
If I go crawling home now,

18:17.322 --> 18:20.098
she'll just keep
treating me like a baby.

18:20.174 --> 18:21.340
I'm good here.

18:21.417 --> 18:22.842
(boom)

18:27.515 --> 18:29.275
I should probably
sleep on the floor tonight.

18:32.094 --> 18:33.611
Dirk!
We have to get Bernie home.

18:33.688 --> 18:36.339
He really misses Grandma.

18:36.341 --> 18:37.764
Yeah, I think
she misses him, too.

18:37.842 --> 18:38.842
What makes you say that?

18:40.436 --> 18:42.278
I miss you so much!

18:44.365 --> 18:46.682
I don't know.
She could also be fine.

18:46.684 --> 18:48.684
She's tough to read.

18:48.686 --> 18:54.114
If we could just trick Bernie and
Grandma into being in the same room

18:54.192 --> 18:55.594
at the same time,
they'd be forced to talk it out,

18:55.618 --> 18:56.968
and Bernie would move home.

18:57.044 --> 19:01.530
What if we turned this phone
booth into a time machine,

19:01.532 --> 19:05.368
and go back before Bernie
and Grandma were fighting?

19:05.370 --> 19:09.972
Ahh, that wouldn't work.
We don't have any time juice.

19:12.210 --> 19:17.155
Or, we just lock them in the
phone booth until they make up.

19:17.231 --> 19:18.791
I don't know, you lost me
at time juice.

19:19.975 --> 19:22.568
You said time juice.

19:22.645 --> 19:24.829
Whoa! Now I see why
Bernie broke up with you.

19:29.227 --> 19:33.487
Amelia, where have you been?
Jessie's ready to start.

19:33.564 --> 19:37.233
Yeah, I just came to say
I'm not doin' this.

19:37.235 --> 19:40.511
W... I don't get what she does, and being
in her video would be bad for my brand.

19:40.588 --> 19:43.297
I mean, look at her hair color.
Ugh! What is that?

19:46.835 --> 19:49.745
Uh... But it's... it's
basically the same as you...

19:49.747 --> 19:51.430
Amelia!

19:51.507 --> 19:54.083
Please, this is a really
big deal.

19:54.085 --> 19:58.087
The only reason Jessie is letting
me be in her video is you.

19:58.089 --> 20:01.440
If you're out, I'm out.

20:01.517 --> 20:03.150
(sigh) You're lucky
I really like you.

20:05.763 --> 20:07.354
All right, let's do this.

20:07.432 --> 20:11.876
Okay, before we start, which one
of you wants her name in my song?

20:11.953 --> 20:13.786
Oh my gosh, me! Please, me!
Paige Olvera!

20:13.862 --> 20:15.557
Please, please, please, please, please,
please, please, please, please!

20:15.581 --> 20:17.381
Anyone but me is fine.

20:17.458 --> 20:20.960
Great. Stand over there and
follow my lead, ladies.

20:23.614 --> 20:27.374
I can't believe I'm gonna be
in a Jessie Grant video!

20:27.452 --> 20:31.712
I can't believe I'm gonna be
in a Jessie Grant video!

20:31.789 --> 20:35.549
Hey, guys. This is a song about an
animal that bit me at the zoo once,

20:35.626 --> 20:38.218
and I've felt a personal
vendetta against it ever since.

20:38.296 --> 20:41.572
Ooh, a vendetta video, I can't
wait to see where this is going.

20:41.649 --> 20:43.482
It's called "I Hate Sea Otters."

20:43.559 --> 20:44.559
What?

20:46.228 --> 20:48.395
♪ Sea otters stink ♪

20:54.479 --> 21:00.240
(gasps) No, no, no, no, no,
no, this is... this is sick,

21:00.318 --> 21:01.926
and I cannot be a part of this!

21:04.489 --> 21:06.747
- Quick selfie.
- (camera shutter clicks)

21:06.824 --> 21:08.933
Shame on you!

21:09.010 --> 21:10.217
I love you!

21:14.682 --> 21:16.515
Bernie, you are gonna
love this surprise,

21:16.592 --> 21:19.685
'cause it might involve meeting the
puppeteer behind your favorite TV show,

21:19.762 --> 21:21.595
Princess Puppets.

21:21.672 --> 21:27.860
Great. I'm going to thank that man
for his contribution to this planet.

21:27.936 --> 21:31.347
Roz, you are going to love this surprise,
because it might involve meeting the puppeteer

21:31.349 --> 21:35.293
behind Bernie's favorite
TV show, Princess Puppets.

21:35.369 --> 21:37.449
Great! I'm gonna punch that
idiot in his stupid face!

21:44.953 --> 21:47.287
Frankie/Dirk: Now take
off your blindfolds!

21:47.365 --> 21:48.767
- Bernard?
- You're not Hanz Yorgensen!

21:48.791 --> 21:52.125
(banging on door) - Uh, uh, uh.
You are not coming out

21:52.203 --> 21:53.523
until you resolve
all your issues.

21:56.374 --> 21:58.465
You made sure the lock
was secure, right?

21:58.543 --> 22:00.559
Frankie, come on. I'm not smart.

22:03.881 --> 22:05.214
What a waste of time.

22:05.216 --> 22:08.475
- I'm outta here.
- No, no, no, no, no, no one leaves.

22:08.553 --> 22:12.071
You two are making up today. Bernie,
you said you missed your grandma.

22:12.147 --> 22:14.390
You said that?

22:14.392 --> 22:17.451
I might have.
To a punching bag and a wig.

22:20.823 --> 22:22.840
And Grandma, I know
you miss Bernie, too.

22:22.917 --> 22:24.567
Dirk, what did she say?

22:24.569 --> 22:27.294
Let's smash open his piggy bank
and split what's inside.

22:29.073 --> 22:30.073
After that.

22:31.242 --> 22:33.517
She stared at a picture
of him and cried.

22:33.594 --> 22:35.302
Really? You cried?

22:36.931 --> 22:38.672
You never cry.

22:38.749 --> 22:40.524
Well, I missed you.

22:42.587 --> 22:44.420
You missed her, she missed you.

22:44.422 --> 22:45.529
Now let's dig deeper.

22:47.608 --> 22:50.109
Why are you so hard on me
all the time?

22:50.185 --> 22:51.610
You treat me like I'm a baby.

22:51.687 --> 22:54.263
I worry about you.

22:54.265 --> 22:57.023
I want you to be able
to take care of yourself.

22:57.101 --> 22:58.542
I'm not gonna be around forever.

22:59.937 --> 23:03.956
(sigh) I'm sorry if I
come off harsh sometimes.

23:04.032 --> 23:09.387
I just do it 'cause there's nothing I
want more than to see you succeed.

23:09.463 --> 23:11.046
I love you, Bernard.

23:13.951 --> 23:15.342
I love you, too, Grandma.

23:19.290 --> 23:20.434
Thanks for doin'
all this, Frankie.

23:20.458 --> 23:21.473
You're a good friend.

23:24.478 --> 23:26.237
Anytime, Bernie.

23:26.313 --> 23:31.300
And Frankie? How dare you
break up with my grandson.

23:31.302 --> 23:32.651
He's too good for you!

23:32.728 --> 23:35.913
I faked the whole thing!

23:35.990 --> 23:37.072
He said you'd say that!

23:40.903 --> 23:43.312
Well, we did it.

23:43.314 --> 23:44.641
Guess our lives can finally
go back to normal.

23:44.665 --> 23:48.241
Seriously. Although I could
use a break from Grandma.

23:48.319 --> 23:51.170
As a good friend, I gotta
tell you, there is no reason

23:51.246 --> 23:52.246
you have to live there.

23:55.159 --> 23:56.416
Hey, hey, roomie!

23:56.494 --> 23:58.084
Oh, no.
