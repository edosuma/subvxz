WEBVTT

00:11.552 --> 00:13.646
Forget about the three-peat, Baumann.
You are going down.

00:13.648 --> 00:16.114
Count backwards from 100, Alex.
You're gonna be a loser by 99.

00:16.116 --> 00:17.516
[clenched teeth] Come on, kids.

00:17.518 --> 00:19.217
This is supposed to be fun. It's Christmas.

00:19.219 --> 00:21.619
Mm-hmm. What?

00:21.621 --> 00:22.921
No lights?

00:22.923 --> 00:24.789
Okay, grudge match it is.

00:24.791 --> 00:27.259
All right. Listen up, everyone.

00:27.261 --> 00:29.061
The judge has ruled.

00:29.730 --> 00:33.831
In the great Christmas sweater
throwdown, we have a winner.

00:33.833 --> 00:36.301
And it is...

00:36.303 --> 00:37.602
Doctor...

00:38.262 --> 00:38.770
Alex Reid.

00:38.772 --> 00:40.337
Yes! Finally!

00:40.339 --> 00:41.806
Ha! I mean, good job. Good job. [applause]

00:41.808 --> 00:43.741
- Congratulations.
- Thank you. Gimme that.

00:43.743 --> 00:45.076
[singsongy] Thank you!

00:45.078 --> 00:47.579
The fix is in. I'm out of here.

00:47.581 --> 00:48.813
Always knew you were going places, babe.

00:48.815 --> 00:50.014
- [laughs]
- Meep! Bloop!

00:50.016 --> 00:52.016
- Whoo!
- Too bad, uh, there's no celebrating

00:52.018 --> 00:53.217
till after the night shift.

00:53.219 --> 00:54.351
Christmas Eve. Yay!

00:54.353 --> 00:57.221
Yeah, ice storm. Double yay.

00:57.223 --> 00:59.691
Hey, did you buy your Secret Santa gift yet?

00:59.693 --> 01:01.725
Yeah, couple days ago.

01:01.727 --> 01:04.061
You haven't?

01:04.063 --> 01:06.463
I picked a hard one... Dawn.

01:06.465 --> 01:07.965
Oh. Yeah.

01:07.967 --> 01:10.266
She's kinda tough to shop for.
[cell phone vibrates]

01:10.268 --> 01:13.070
Okay, trauma 15 minutes out. Oh, boy.

01:13.072 --> 01:15.072
- No silent night for us.
- Mm-hmm.

01:15.074 --> 01:18.241
[siren wailing in distance]

01:18.243 --> 01:19.810
[sighs]

01:23.547 --> 01:25.615
You must be eager to see the boys.

01:25.617 --> 01:27.250
Yeah, first Christmas I've had them

01:27.252 --> 01:29.385
- since Ariel and I split up.
- Mm.

01:29.387 --> 01:31.121
I really want them to
have a good time tonight.

01:31.123 --> 01:32.888
And you're gonna go full
superdad to make up for it.

01:32.890 --> 01:36.626
Get this... tonight, "Die Hard."
Best Christmas movie ever.

01:36.628 --> 01:37.727
And they haven't seen it.

01:37.729 --> 01:39.061
Aren't they a little young for that?

01:39.063 --> 01:40.597
Then pizza,

01:40.599 --> 01:43.266
hot chocolate, sleeping
bags by the fireplace.

01:43.268 --> 01:45.701
And then tomorrow I'll do
some presents, some pancakes,

01:45.703 --> 01:48.270
some tobogganing, and then a
retro video game showdown.

01:48.272 --> 01:50.006
I've got mad pitfall skills.

01:50.008 --> 01:52.875
You're so excited. It's so cute.

01:52.877 --> 01:54.844
I'm sure Dr. Timmins will be here soon.

01:54.846 --> 01:56.612
But I am happy to cover. Thank you.

01:56.614 --> 01:58.547
But I've got to wait for
a supervising E.R. Doctor

01:58.549 --> 02:00.182
to show up, especially in this ice storm.

02:00.184 --> 02:01.817
You want me to try someone else?

02:01.819 --> 02:03.119
It's Christmas Eve.
No one's gonna pick up the phone.

02:03.121 --> 02:05.121
It's fine. He's gonna be here any minute.

02:05.123 --> 02:07.957
Okay, well, trauma's gonna
be here soon. I have to prep.

02:07.959 --> 02:09.959
But if I don't see you, Merry Christmas.

02:09.961 --> 02:11.092
Merry Christmas, Maggie.

02:11.094 --> 02:13.494
[siren wailing in distance, horn honks]

02:13.496 --> 02:15.229
[emergency radio chatter]

02:18.400 --> 02:21.836
[grunts]
I'm here. I might as well pitch in.

02:21.838 --> 02:24.005
Yippee ki-yay.

02:26.018 --> 02:28.109
Woman: "'You were always a good
friend to me," said Scrooge.

02:28.111 --> 02:29.678
"'Thank you."

02:29.680 --> 02:33.347
"'You will be haunted," resumed the ghost,

02:33.349 --> 02:36.450
"'by three spirits."

02:36.452 --> 02:39.187
"Scrooge's countenance fell almost as low"

02:39.189 --> 02:41.422
"as at the ghost's had done."

02:41.424 --> 02:45.693
"'Is that the chance and
hope you mentioned, Jacob?"

02:45.695 --> 02:47.061
"He demanded, in a faltering voice..."

02:47.245 --> 02:48.570
Hey there.

02:49.031 --> 02:50.198
Hi.

02:50.200 --> 02:51.699
You, uh, you need a hand with anything?

02:51.701 --> 02:54.068
No, I'm just here to see my mom.

02:54.070 --> 02:57.304
She's coming to meet me.
We do it every year.

02:57.306 --> 02:59.539
- Every Christmas?
- Five years now.

02:59.931 --> 03:03.042
It's kind of our thing since,
you know, I died.

03:05.117 --> 03:07.947
Right.

03:07.949 --> 03:09.849
Um...

03:09.851 --> 03:11.918
Listen, there's someplace I need to be.

03:11.920 --> 03:14.053
Um, do you wanna come with me?

03:14.055 --> 03:16.089
Oh, I'm-I'm-I'm Charlie, by the way.

03:16.091 --> 03:18.825
Uh, I'm Aidan.

03:18.827 --> 03:22.362
Thanks, but I don't...
I don't wanna miss my mom.

03:22.364 --> 03:23.563
Merry Christmas.

03:23.565 --> 03:26.164
Yeah. Merry Christmas.

03:26.166 --> 03:27.399
Woman: "When it had said these words,"

03:27.401 --> 03:29.401
"the spectre took its wrapper from the table"

03:29.403 --> 03:32.371
and bound it rounds its head, as before..."

03:32.373 --> 03:36.475
[panting]

03:39.379 --> 03:42.981
[whispering] Get down! Get down.

03:42.983 --> 03:44.750
It's radiology.

03:44.752 --> 03:46.752
They're handing out parts for
"the 12 days of Christmas."

03:46.754 --> 03:50.154
I want nothing to do with maids a-milkin'.

03:50.156 --> 03:51.922
Oh, they're gone.

03:51.924 --> 03:54.859
[exhales deeply]

03:54.861 --> 03:57.094
It's safe here.
All the doctors are on shifts.

03:57.096 --> 03:58.229
Yeah.

03:58.231 --> 04:00.197
Come. We'll make this a Christmas-free zone.

04:00.199 --> 04:02.500
Oh, you're so lucky you're muslim.

04:02.502 --> 04:04.969
You can avoid all this madness.
[whispers] Damn it.

04:04.971 --> 04:07.605
Christmas still... overwhelms me.

04:07.607 --> 04:09.006
- Oh, yeah?
- You know... [clears throat]

04:09.008 --> 04:11.142
I once did a Nativity play in school.

04:11.144 --> 04:13.076
I wanted to be the angel
with fluffy white wings.

04:13.078 --> 04:16.045
Oh, of course you did. What happened?

04:16.047 --> 04:18.415
- Piers Sorra got the part.
- Ugh.

04:18.416 --> 04:21.606
- He was blond. So blond.
- Hmm.

04:21.656 --> 04:23.620
Mainly it's the Christmas
aesthetic that turns me off.

04:23.622 --> 04:25.338
- Mm.
- People get so huggy this time of year.

04:25.388 --> 04:27.791
[mouth full] I know, right? I mean,
it's just another day.

04:27.793 --> 04:29.693
Exactly. This is peaceful.

04:29.695 --> 04:30.860
Mm. [sighs]

04:34.198 --> 04:35.932
- Hey.
- [crunching]

04:35.934 --> 04:37.500
Wanna play a game of chess?

04:37.502 --> 04:39.968
I don't know. That depends.

04:39.970 --> 04:41.970
Do you feel like being humiliated?

04:41.972 --> 04:44.540
[laughs]

04:46.142 --> 04:48.744
- What have we got?
- Laverne Davis, 53.

04:48.746 --> 04:50.846
Medics say she was bringing
a blanket to a homeless guy

04:50.848 --> 04:52.682
under the expressway,
and a car skidded off the road

04:52.684 --> 04:53.816
and ran right into them.

04:53.818 --> 04:55.618
Laverne, can you hear me?

04:55.620 --> 04:57.320
We're gonna take care of you now.

04:57.322 --> 04:58.521
Where's the other victim?

04:58.523 --> 04:59.654
Just arrived. Minor injuries.

04:59.656 --> 05:01.123
We're looking at multiple traumas.

05:01.125 --> 05:03.992
He was revived already once at the scene.

05:03.994 --> 05:05.194
- How's that F.A.S.T.?
- On it.

05:05.196 --> 05:06.761
Just having a look to see what's going on

05:06.763 --> 05:08.396
- in your belly, Laverne.
- I got multiple fractures here.

05:08.398 --> 05:10.432
I need full imagining,
spine, and extremities.

05:10.434 --> 05:12.201
That'll have to wait.
There's a lot of blood in here.

05:12.203 --> 05:13.435
Let's get her to the O.R.

05:13.437 --> 05:15.603
Page Lopez to assist and
have blood on standby.

05:15.605 --> 05:16.738
Lopez isn't here yet.

05:16.740 --> 05:18.073
- Stuck in the storm like everyone else.
- What?

05:18.075 --> 05:19.240
Blood's already on the way.

05:19.242 --> 05:20.908
Uh, Charlie, could you give me a hand?

05:20.910 --> 05:22.810
- Yeah, whatever you need.
- All right, let's move.

05:22.812 --> 05:24.245
Hang on a second.

05:24.247 --> 05:26.214
[monitor beeping rapidly]
I'm not liking those rhythms.

05:26.216 --> 05:28.182
[sighs] She's in V-fib.

05:28.184 --> 05:29.817
- Let's get those paddles.
- Come on, Laverne.

05:29.819 --> 05:30.918
With this much trauma,

05:30.968 --> 05:32.182
if she gets through the night,
it's gonna be a miracle.

05:32.232 --> 05:34.889
Well, it's Christmas.
Let's see if we can give her one.

05:36.000 --> 05:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:44.143 --> 05:46.327
Clear. [paddles thunk]

05:46.329 --> 05:47.863
[monitor beeping erratically]
Come on, come on, come on.

05:47.865 --> 05:50.599
And we're back in sinus rhythm for now.
Let's move. You ready?

05:50.601 --> 05:52.200
Uh, yeah, I got a quick consult.
Uh, have her prepped.

05:52.202 --> 05:54.335
- I'll meet you down there in five.
- Okay.

05:58.614 --> 05:59.674
That's him over there.

05:59.676 --> 06:00.908
All right.

06:00.910 --> 06:02.610
[baby crying]

06:02.612 --> 06:05.946
[siren wailing in distance]

06:05.948 --> 06:09.683
Um, she's going to be okay, huh?

06:09.685 --> 06:10.985
You're the one who was with her, right?

06:10.987 --> 06:12.787
She was trying to help me.

06:12.789 --> 06:16.123
I remember her reaching out,
and then the car...

06:16.125 --> 06:18.025
Okay, my friend Jackson and I
are going to help you, okay?

06:18.027 --> 06:19.426
So why don't you grab a seat on the bed?

06:19.428 --> 06:21.341
Come on. Okay.

06:22.563 --> 06:24.832
Let me know how things turn out with her.

06:24.834 --> 06:27.434
And if there's anything
I can do... a-anything.

06:27.436 --> 06:29.335
She's in good hands, all right?
She's got a great surgeon.

06:29.337 --> 06:30.804
Let's worry about you.

06:30.806 --> 06:32.939
- Now let me have a look at that wrist.
- [inhales sharply]

06:32.941 --> 06:35.008
[exhales slowly]

06:35.010 --> 06:36.843
Oh, here's a little Christmas present

06:36.893 --> 06:38.278
from me to you.

06:38.280 --> 06:39.645
Check.

06:41.748 --> 06:42.949
Not anymore.

06:42.951 --> 06:44.383
And it's mate in seven if
you don't up your game.

06:44.385 --> 06:46.019
Oh, damn it.

06:46.021 --> 06:47.586
How come you're working tonight, anyway?

06:47.588 --> 06:49.122
Wasn't there some junior to take call?

06:49.124 --> 06:52.091
Oh, Richardson asked me to
cover the start of her shift.

06:52.093 --> 06:53.358
Must be the storm.

06:53.360 --> 06:55.360
No, more likely she doesn't
want to leave her kids

06:55.362 --> 06:57.062
on Christmas Eve.

06:57.201 --> 07:00.398
God, it was always...
such a big deal, you know?

07:00.400 --> 07:03.235
You... you make a snack for Santa

07:03.237 --> 07:04.937
and you gotta have a carrot for Rudolph.

07:04.939 --> 07:06.404
And then you tuck 'em in

07:06.406 --> 07:09.308
and you get to fill the
little stockings and...

07:11.978 --> 07:13.111
nothing better.

07:13.113 --> 07:14.713
I thought you didn't like Christmas?

07:14.715 --> 07:17.382
No, I-I don't... [clears throat] anymore.

07:17.384 --> 07:19.984
But when Molly was little... Oh.

07:19.986 --> 07:21.518
Now where's Molly tonight?

07:21.520 --> 07:24.555
Oh. She's with her dad, so...

07:24.557 --> 07:26.257
[cell phone vibrates]

07:27.960 --> 07:29.894
[sighs] I got a consult.

07:29.896 --> 07:31.595
Well, make your move before you go

07:31.597 --> 07:33.831
so I can study the board.

07:33.833 --> 07:35.299
Okay, what am I gonna do, hmm?

07:35.301 --> 07:38.836
I mean, this is on the highway
to the Christmas danger zone.

07:39.032 --> 07:40.704
Did you know the nurses
were dancing to Boney M.?

07:40.706 --> 07:41.805
Shahir...

07:41.807 --> 07:43.774
[inhales deeply, exhales deeply]

07:43.776 --> 07:45.009
Stay strong.

07:45.011 --> 07:47.443
It's just another day.

07:48.846 --> 07:50.680
Not like I don't appreciate the help,

07:50.682 --> 07:51.948
but I got this, Dr. Miller.

07:51.950 --> 07:53.316
Gotta stay busy, Jackson.

07:53.318 --> 07:54.951
Keep my mind off the fact that
I'm already two hours late

07:54.953 --> 07:57.220
- to pick up the boys.
- Then let's distract you.

07:57.222 --> 08:01.324
These were for Dr. Timmins,
but screw him. He's late.

08:01.326 --> 08:02.692
Christmas bingo.

08:02.694 --> 08:05.762
I'm not gonna be here long enough.

08:05.764 --> 08:06.829
Pudding burn?

08:06.831 --> 08:08.497
Yeah, light the pudding, burn your hand.

08:08.499 --> 08:09.865
We had two last year.

08:09.867 --> 08:11.600
Okay, I'm in, just till he gets here.

08:11.602 --> 08:14.169
Okay, uh, mark a box for every injury.

08:14.171 --> 08:15.704
First full line...

08:15.706 --> 08:18.774
[man coughing]

08:18.776 --> 08:20.342
All right, guys, hold up.

08:20.344 --> 08:23.745
Mr. Claus, what brings you in here tonight?

08:23.747 --> 08:25.180
I don't wanna say.

08:25.182 --> 08:27.283
You got stuck in your chimney, didn't you?

08:27.285 --> 08:29.184
Yeah.

08:29.186 --> 08:30.719
Yeah.

08:32.054 --> 08:35.557
All right, well, let's...
see what other gifts you brought us.

08:35.558 --> 08:37.926
[coughs, groans]

08:41.096 --> 08:44.733
What a mess. There is a lot
of blood. Keep packin'.

08:44.735 --> 08:47.502
She's hypotensive, Alex.
You better find that bleed fast.

08:47.504 --> 08:48.870
Yeah, I know.

08:48.872 --> 08:50.604
Here it is. Whoa!

18:42.646 --> 18:46.082
Well, your sister has sustained
catastrophic injuries.

18:46.084 --> 18:49.852
Even after multiple surgeries,
her chances of survival are...

18:49.854 --> 18:51.920
Can you tell me...

18:51.922 --> 18:54.023
I-I guess I don't understand what happened.

18:54.025 --> 18:58.461
Apparently, she was delivering
a blanket to a homeless man

18:58.463 --> 18:59.928
camped out under the expressway,

18:59.930 --> 19:02.331

Listen, um, Laverne's boy,
her only child, Gabriel,

19:07.738 --> 19:13.141
He's... he's on his way here.
He's everything to her.

19:13.143 --> 19:15.544
She...

19:15.546 --> 19:17.513

19:28.337 --> 19:31.161
Gabriel will at least
get the chance to say goodbye.

19:32.772 --> 19:34.172
It's good that you're here now.

19:34.174 --> 19:37.543
If either of you are in touch with Gabriel,

19:37.545 --> 19:38.944
you should tell him that
he needs to get here

19:38.946 --> 19:40.078
as soon as possible.

19:40.080 --> 19:40.766

looking out for people,

19:43.518 --> 19:45.183

19:45.553 --> 19:48.520
No act of kindness, no matter how small,
is ever wasted. [sniffles]

[whispers] Yeah.

20:05.305 --> 20:07.105

20:22.889 --> 20:24.055

with her son's name, Aidan?

20:30.697 --> 20:32.563
Oh, yeah. You mean Shona.

20:32.565 --> 20:36.067
It was so sad, her losing
that sweet little boy.

20:36.069 --> 20:38.603
Yeah. Has she been around?

20:38.605 --> 20:40.972
No, and I wonder if she'll even come

20:40.974 --> 20:42.840
- in this awful weather.
- Mm.

20:42.842 --> 20:46.477
Her baby must only be a few months old.

20:46.479 --> 20:47.677
Her... her baby?

20:47.679 --> 20:50.747
Yeah, she told me she
was pregnant last year.

20:50.749 --> 20:53.550
I hope that family can move
on after all that grief.

20:53.552 --> 20:54.751
Uh...

20:54.753 --> 20:56.753

20:56.755 --> 20:58.021
Sure.

She has a new baby.

21:16.674 --> 21:18.841
I never...

I never really cared about that.
It's just...

Your kids still believe in Santa?

Probably not much longer.

22:00.115 --> 22:01.282
So you think I'm still gonna

Well, I was supposed to have
my boys tonight and tomorrow,

22:10.926 --> 22:12.826
but I don't think it's gonna work out.

22:12.828 --> 22:16.096
Yeah, because of idiots like
me clogging up your E.R.

22:16.098 --> 22:18.364
To me, you were trying to do
something cool for your kids.

She got pulled into an O.R.

Right. Thanks, Jackson.

I kinda wish she stayed home.

Really? There's no place
else you'd rather be?
