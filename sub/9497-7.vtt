<b>- Fuck this fuckin’ guy.</b>

00:29.959 --> 00:31.626
<b>Comedian asshole.</b>

00:31.709 --> 00:33.000
<b>- Which one?</b>

00:33.083 --> 00:34.083
<b>- Ronnie Wilkis?</b>

00:34.167 --> 00:35.501
<b>- Who’s that?</b>

00:35.584 --> 00:36.834
<b>- I made it up.</b>

00:36.918 --> 00:40.250
<b>- No, he means Casey Louistein, right?</b>

00:40.334 --> 00:41.584
<b>He said that thing about Trump.</b>

00:41.667 --> 00:46.417
<b>- Yeah, shithead, half a clown telling</b>
<b>me how to vote, like he knows anything?</b>

00:46.501 --> 00:48.042
<b>- I don't think he was trying</b>
<b>to tell you how to vote.</b>

00:48.125 --> 00:49.584
<b>I think he just--</b>
<b>He wanted you to think--</b>

00:49.667 --> 00:50.667
<b>- No, no, no.</b>

00:50.751 --> 00:54.834
<b>Just tell your dumb jokes and shut the</b>
<b>fuck up so that grown folks can talk.</b>

00:54.918 --> 00:58.501
<b>- I hate when celebrities think that</b>
<b>anybody cares about what they think.</b>

00:58.584 --> 01:00.000
<b>So fucking annoying.</b>
<b>- Bourbon on the rocks.</b>

01:00.083 --> 01:01.834
<b>- Oh, I don't know how to vote!</b>

01:01.918 --> 01:05.250
<b>I need Casey Louistein</b>
<b>to come from on high</b>

01:05.334 --> 01:08.542
<b>and tell me who's Hitler,</b>
<b>'cause everyone's Hitler.</b>

01:08.626 --> 01:12.626
<b>I need a Hollywood sodomite to let me</b>
<b>know what's what.</b>

01:12.709 --> 01:14.292
<b>- Sodomite, sodomite.</b>

01:14.375 --> 01:15.375
<b>What does that come from?</b>

01:15.459 --> 01:17.083
<b>- From, uh, Sodom.</b>

01:17.167 --> 01:18.542
<b>- Yeah, Sodom and Gomorrah.</b>

01:18.626 --> 01:21.959
<b>But I don't-- I never knew that story,</b>
<b>like, I don't know what that story was.</b>

01:22.042 --> 01:23.876
<b>- You don't know the story</b>
<b>of Sodom and Gomorrah?</b>

01:23.959 --> 01:25.209
<b>- Not really.</b>

01:25.292 --> 01:28.626
<b>- That's how we know homos should</b>
<b>burn, according to the Bible.</b>

01:28.709 --> 01:29.751
<b>- Oh.</b>

01:29.834 --> 01:32.876
<b>- I don't think that, but the Bible,</b>
<b>that's where it teaches us about--</b>

01:32.959 --> 01:35.167
<b>- What's that story?</b>
<b>What's Sodom and Gomorrah?</b>

01:35.250 --> 01:39.876
<b>- You know, it's Abraham, the father</b>
<b>of Israel and his brother Lot,</b>

01:39.959 --> 01:42.834
<b>and they're picking</b>
<b>a place to live, right?</b>

01:42.918 --> 01:45.292
<b>They each-- I don't know why they have</b>
<b>to live in separate spots,</b>

01:45.375 --> 01:47.542
<b>but they can't live near each other,</b>

01:47.626 --> 01:51.626
<b>so Abraham picks the wilderness,</b>
<b>where good folks live in tents, right?</b>

01:51.709 --> 01:54.000
<b>Away from sin and what have you.</b>

01:54.083 --> 01:57.667
<b>And then Lot, uh, I think 'cause</b>
<b>his wife likes fancy things,</b>

01:57.751 --> 02:00.375
<b>he goes to Sodom, which is--</b>

02:00.459 --> 02:02.876
<b>You know, it's like a gay neighborhood,</b>
<b>so it's nice, right?</b>

02:02.959 --> 02:05.626
<b>I’m not really clear</b>
<b>on what Gomorrah did wrong.</b>

02:05.709 --> 02:08.876
<b>I know sodomy is where we get</b>
<b>butt fucking from.</b>

02:08.959 --> 02:11.709
<b>It's just wrong hole usage,</b>
<b>so Gomorrah, who--</b>

02:11.792 --> 02:14.083
<b>That must have been ten times worse,</b>
<b>'cause they don't even bring them up.</b>

02:14.167 --> 02:17.751
<b>But Lot moved to Sodom,</b>
<b>and you know, it's the biggest city</b>

02:17.834 --> 02:20.167
<b>and these people can't use the right</b>
<b>hole to save their lives,</b>

02:20.250 --> 02:22.584
<b>and as you know,</b>
<b>God cares deeply about that,</b>

02:22.667 --> 02:26.626
<b>so he goes to Abraham and he goes,</b>
<b>I gotta tell you,</b>

02:26.709 --> 02:29.542
<b>where your brother lives,</b>
<b>I mean, it's crazy,</b>

02:29.626 --> 02:32.042
<b>they are just fucking anything</b>
<b>and everything</b>

02:32.125 --> 02:33.959
<b>and I'm gonna just have</b>
<b>to burn it with fire.</b>

02:34.042 --> 02:36.125
<b>That's how bad it's getting, you know?</b>

02:36.209 --> 02:38.542
<b>And Abraham goes,</b>
<b>Lord, please, don't--</b>

02:38.626 --> 02:40.667
<b>Don't murder everyone in the city,</b>
<b>you know?</b>

02:40.751 --> 02:44.209
<b>What if there's just 20--</b>
<b>20 righteous men?</b>

02:44.292 --> 02:45.834
<b>Twenty righteous men, don't kill them.</b>

02:45.918 --> 02:47.459
<b>And God goes, all right, hold on,</b>
<b>I'm gonna check.</b>

02:47.542 --> 02:49.083
<b>Nope.</b>
<b>There's not.</b>

02:49.167 --> 02:51.584
<b>And then Abraham goes, okay, 10.</b>

02:51.667 --> 02:53.626
<b>He Jews God down</b>

02:53.709 --> 02:57.542
<b>and God ain't having it and he goes,</b>
<b>nah, there's not even 10.</b>

02:57.626 --> 03:00.667
<b>He goes, but cheer up, I'm gonna save</b>
<b>your brother and his family,</b>

03:00.751 --> 03:06.584
<b>and what God does is send two angels</b>
<b>disguised as travelers, okay?</b>

03:06.667 --> 03:10.292
<b>And they're gonna get Lot out</b>
<b>before the big, you know, droning.</b>

03:10.375 --> 03:12.250
<b>The biblical droning, let's call it.</b>

03:12.334 --> 03:15.918
<b>So, uh, so they show up and they're</b>
<b>explaining to Lot what's happening,</b>

03:16.000 --> 03:20.125
<b>and all of a sudden, there's a knock</b>
<b>at the door and it's the entire city.</b>

03:20.209 --> 03:21.209
<b>Like, the whole--</b>

03:21.292 --> 03:26.125
<b>Every man and boy in the city,</b>
<b>like every single one has shown up</b>

03:26.209 --> 03:28.209
<b>and surrounded the house and they say,</b>

03:28.292 --> 03:30.501
<b>hey, Lot, you know those guys that just</b>
<b>came into your house?</b>

03:30.584 --> 03:31.792
<b>Those two strangers?</b>

03:31.876 --> 03:33.334
<b>Send 'em out,</b>
<b>because we're gonna all fuck 'em.</b>

03:33.417 --> 03:34.709
<b>- No.</b>
<b>- Yeah.</b>

03:34.792 --> 03:37.667
<b>- Horace: This is in the Bible?</b>
<b>- I’m paraphrasing it, but it's--</b>

03:37.751 --> 03:40.209
<b>They're gonna fuck 'em.</b>
<b>Yeah, I don't-- I don't get it either.</b>

03:40.292 --> 03:41.834
<b>I don't know if that's like the last...</b>

03:41.918 --> 03:45.125
<b>Maybe they've just all fucked so much</b>
<b>that there's not a new hole in town,</b>

03:45.209 --> 03:47.000
<b>but I don't know when Lot moved in</b>

03:47.083 --> 03:51.292
<b>how he got past that gauntlet of dicks</b>
<b>that apparently--</b>

03:51.375 --> 03:53.167
<b>Anyway, so Lot goes--</b>

03:53.250 --> 03:56.667
<b>Now, this is also important, because</b>
<b>besides how we know homos are bad,</b>

03:56.751 --> 03:59.375
<b>according to the Bible,</b>
<b>this is also how we know</b>

03:59.459 --> 04:03.542
<b>that a straight man's asshole virginity</b>
<b>is much more sacred</b>

04:03.626 --> 04:07.000
<b>and precious than like</b>
<b>your garbage pussy, okay?</b>

04:07.083 --> 04:10.125
<b>Not you--</b>
<b>- You said my pussy is garbage?</b>

04:10.209 --> 04:13.000
<b>- Well, no, all pussy is garbage,</b>
<b>just in the eyes of God.</b>

04:13.083 --> 04:14.542
<b>Not to me, I like it.</b>

04:14.626 --> 04:17.375
<b>But I’m just saying,</b>
<b>in the Bible, your--</b>

04:17.459 --> 04:20.041
<b>To compare-- just an asshole hair</b>
<b>of mine is worthless,</b>

04:20.125 --> 04:21.250
<b>and that's in the story,</b>

04:21.334 --> 04:25.542
<b>so they go send these guys out</b>
<b>and Lot goes, oh, my God, don't--</b>

04:25.626 --> 04:27.083
<b>Please don't fuck our guests.</b>

04:27.167 --> 04:28.918
<b>All of you.</b>

04:29.000 --> 04:31.834
<b>And he goes,</b>
<b>look, take my two daughters.</b>

04:31.918 --> 04:33.501
<b>- No.</b>
<b>- He has two daughters, yeah.</b>

04:33.584 --> 04:34.667
<b>He goes, take my two--</b>

04:34.751 --> 04:36.000
<b>'Cause I know you guys gotta rape</b>
<b>something, right?</b>

04:36.083 --> 04:38.834
<b>So at least get it in the right hole.</b>

04:38.918 --> 04:40.834
<b>I mean, actually,</b>
<b>fuck 'em wherever you want,</b>

04:40.918 --> 04:44.292
<b>but just please don't harm these two</b>
<b>guys I've never met before.</b>

04:44.375 --> 04:46.125
<b>So--</b>
<b>- That happened to my uncle.</b>

04:46.209 --> 04:48.125
<b>(laughter)</b>

04:48.209 --> 04:50.709
<b>- Well, so things looked pretty grim,</b>
<b>you know, for those angels.</b>

04:50.792 --> 04:52.542
<b>- Yeah, so--</b>
<b>- And the angels say, let's--</b>

04:52.626 --> 04:55.667
<b>Now we're gonna step in, and they strike</b>
<b>everyone blind, the whole--</b>

04:55.751 --> 04:58.167
<b>Every man in the city and boy, blind.</b>

04:58.250 --> 05:01.083
<b>And then they keep looking for</b>
<b>the angels even though they're blind.</b>

05:01.167 --> 05:03.375
<b>That's one of my favorite parts</b>
<b>and they're like, where...</b>

05:03.459 --> 05:05.667
<b>Where are those angels?</b>
<b>I gotta have 'em.</b>

05:05.751 --> 05:08.334
<b>And the angels lead Lot and his family</b>
<b>out of the city,</b>

05:08.417 --> 05:10.542
<b>'cause now there's time to explode,</b>

05:10.626 --> 05:12.918
<b>and they go listen, this--</b>
<b>Don't even look back.</b>

05:13.000 --> 05:15.584
<b>We're just gonna run straight</b>
<b>outta here,</b>

05:15.667 --> 05:17.083
<b>do not look back, whatever you do.</b>

05:17.167 --> 05:19.501
<b>Don't take any of your stuff,</b>
<b>we're just getting the hell out.</b>

05:19.584 --> 05:22.459
<b>So they all are running,</b>
<b>and then Lot's wife,</b>

05:22.542 --> 05:25.584
<b>because she misses her stuff</b>
<b>or whatever,</b>

05:25.667 --> 05:28.667
<b>she turns around, like</b>
<b>wistfully, as they're running,</b>

05:28.751 --> 05:30.667
<b>and turns into a pillar of salt.</b>

05:30.751 --> 05:32.751
<b>Yeah.</b>
<b>This dumb cunt can't--</b>

05:32.834 --> 05:34.209
<b>- Whoa, whoa, whoa.</b>
<b>Watch that!</b>

05:34.292 --> 05:35.709
<b>- Watch what?</b>

05:35.792 --> 05:37.501
<b>- We don't say that word in here.</b>

05:37.584 --> 05:39.876
<b>- That's where you draw the line?</b>

05:39.959 --> 05:41.626
<b>- Yeah, don't say that word in here.</b>

05:41.709 --> 05:43.667
<b>- You don't say it?</b>
<b>- No, I don't say it.</b>

05:43.751 --> 05:44.918
<b>- Okay, well, let me say it for you.</b>

05:45.000 --> 05:46.626
<b>Cunt!</b>
<b>- Okay.</b>

05:46.709 --> 05:47.918
<b>- Okay, okay...</b>
<b>- You know what? Get outta here.</b>

05:48.000 --> 05:49.083
<b>- Hey, hey, hey, hey....</b>

05:49.167 --> 05:50.167
<b>- Get out--</b>
<b>Get outta here right--</b>

05:50.250 --> 05:51.250
<b>- She's not serious, right?</b>
<b>- Don't look at him!</b>

05:51.334 --> 05:52.876
<b>Listen to me.</b>
<b>Get outta here right now.</b>

05:52.959 --> 05:54.751
<b>- Sylvie, we don't do that.</b>
<b>What are you doing?</b>

05:54.834 --> 05:56.042
<b>- Turn around and get out of here.</b>

05:56.125 --> 05:57.876
<b>- What the fuck, man?</b>

05:57.959 --> 05:59.334
<b>- Maybe go, Kurt.</b>

05:59.417 --> 06:00.709
<b>- 'Cause I said "cunt,"</b>
<b>you're throwing me out?</b>

06:00.792 --> 06:01.834
<b>- All right.</b>
<b>- I am throwing you out.</b>

06:01.918 --> 06:04.250
<b>- Maybe you should just go. Just--</b>
<b>- And don't come back.</b>

06:04.334 --> 06:06.000
<b>- Whoa, whoa.</b>
<b>- No, no, come on, he can come--</b>

06:06.083 --> 06:08.250
<b>- Turn around!</b>
<b>- We don't-- He's not banned.</b>

06:08.334 --> 06:10.167
<b>- No, he can leave to cool you off,</b>
<b>but he's not--</b>

06:10.250 --> 06:11.751
<b>- All right.</b>
<b>Fine, cool.</b>

06:11.834 --> 06:13.000
<b>- Just go, Kurt.</b>
<b>- All right.</b>

06:13.083 --> 06:16.250
<b>- Come back later.</b>
<b>- Yeah, no, I get it.</b>

06:16.334 --> 06:20.584
<b>Cunt!</b>

06:20.667 --> 06:23.959
<b>- What the fuck?</b>

06:24.042 --> 06:31.584
<b>- That was intense.</b>

06:31.667 --> 06:33.167
<b>- Uh, hi.</b>

06:33.250 --> 06:34.375
<b>Excuse me.</b>

06:34.459 --> 06:36.209
<b>- Yeah, Pete there is the bartender.</b>
<b>He can help you.</b>

06:36.292 --> 06:40.334
<b>- No.</b>
<b>I was just wondering, um...</b>

06:40.417 --> 06:43.000
<b>- Yeah?</b>

06:43.083 --> 06:46.000
<b>- How you doing?</b>
<b>- How-- How am I doing?</b>

06:46.083 --> 06:48.959
<b>- Yeah, yeah.</b>
<b>It's, uh...</b>

06:49.042 --> 06:51.334
<b>You know, it's a nice day.</b>

06:51.417 --> 06:53.876
<b>- Sure.</b>

06:53.959 --> 06:56.959
<b>- I’m just want-- I just wanted to start</b>
<b>a conversation.</b>

06:57.042 --> 06:59.000
<b>- Ah. No, thank you.</b>

06:59.083 --> 07:01.083
<b>- Well, don't just say no.</b>

07:01.167 --> 07:03.125
<b>I mean, please.</b>

07:03.209 --> 07:05.209
<b>- Okay, what do you--</b>
<b>what do you want?</b>

07:05.292 --> 07:07.292
<b>- Well, that's a great question.</b>

07:07.375 --> 07:11.375
<b>- Okay, well, like I said, um,</b>
<b>I have work to do here.</b>

07:11.459 --> 07:13.125
<b>- Uh...</b>

07:13.209 --> 07:15.834
<b>All right, I think you're very beautiful</b>

07:15.918 --> 07:18.334
<b>and I think you're exciting</b>

07:18.417 --> 07:22.334
<b>and I’d like to have</b>
<b>a convers-s-sation with you.</b>

07:22.417 --> 07:24.250
<b>- Well, uh, see, I am working,</b>

07:24.334 --> 07:29.584
<b>and so no, I really don't want to have</b>
<b>a conversation.</b>

07:29.667 --> 07:30.751
<b>- You have cancer?</b>

07:30.834 --> 07:33.000
<b>- Are you kidding me?</b>
<b>- No, no, I--</b>

07:33.083 --> 07:36.501
<b>I really wanted to know because</b>
<b>I think it's really, really sexy.</b>

07:36.584 --> 07:38.918
<b>- That I have cancer?</b>
<b>- Yes.</b>

07:39.000 --> 07:41.584
<b>I find it very erotic.</b>

07:41.667 --> 07:43.584
<b>Uh, I mean, you're like--</b>

07:43.667 --> 07:46.626
<b>Well, it's not that I think</b>
<b>you're dying,</b>

07:46.709 --> 07:50.292
<b>but it's like,</b>
<b>you body is flirting with death.</b>

07:50.375 --> 07:52.417
<b>That's sexy.</b>
<b>- Really.</b>

07:52.501 --> 07:57.250
<b>- Yeah.</b>
<b>- So what-- what is sexy about that?</b>

07:57.334 --> 07:58.918
<b>(sighs)</b>

07:59.000 --> 08:01.918
<b>- I don't know.</b>

08:02.000 --> 08:05.542
<b>I-- I-- I don't know,</b>
<b>it's just, uh, uh...</b>

08:05.626 --> 08:07.751
<b>I use-- I work in a hospital.</b>

08:07.834 --> 08:09.542
<b>- Doing what?</b>

08:09.626 --> 08:11.667
<b>- I clean.</b>
<b>- Okay.</b>

08:11.751 --> 08:16.042
<b>- Yeah, and-- and-- and, um,</b>
<b>I used to just clean this one floor</b>

08:16.125 --> 08:18.417
<b>and then they started sending me</b>
<b>to the cancer ward</b>

08:18.501 --> 08:21.876
<b>and I started seeing</b>
<b>all these ladies with cancer,</b>

08:21.959 --> 08:26.000
<b>and it really gave me</b>
<b>a very special arousal.</b>

08:26.083 --> 08:28.542
<b>I mean, I don't want to be</b>
<b>off-f-fensive to you.</b>

08:28.626 --> 08:30.375
<b>- Ah, you don't.</b>
<b>Good.</b>

08:30.459 --> 08:31.501
<b>- Am I offending you?</b>

08:31.584 --> 08:35.082
<b>- Well, you're not impressing me.</b>

08:35.167 --> 08:37.626
<b>- Oh, it's not that I would think</b>
<b>the cancer is the only thing</b>

08:37.708 --> 08:39.167
<b>I find attractive about you.</b>

08:39.250 --> 08:40.708
<b>- Ah, well, that's a relief.</b>
<b>Excuse me, will you?</b>

08:40.792 --> 08:42.958
<b>Horace.</b>
<b>- Sure.</b>

08:43.042 --> 08:44.626
<b>- Yeah.</b>
<b>- Is this right?</b>

08:44.709 --> 08:46.125
<b>- What's that?</b>

08:46.209 --> 08:47.959
<b>- I am looking at the beer invoices.</b>

08:48.042 --> 08:50.125
<b>It seems to indicate that we paid</b>
<b>for Budweiser</b>

08:50.209 --> 08:53.000
<b>twice what we did just a year ago.</b>

08:53.083 --> 08:54.501
<b>- Yeah, that's right.</b>

08:54.584 --> 08:56.250
<b>- So what's going on?</b>

08:56.334 --> 08:59.250
<b>- Eh, it's a long story.</b>

08:59.334 --> 09:01.250
<b>- 'Cause we only serve Budweiser.</b>
<b>- Yeah.</b>

09:01.334 --> 09:03.417
<b>- Yeah, so we get charged more?</b>

09:03.501 --> 09:05.292
<b>- Yeah.</b>

09:05.375 --> 09:07.417
<b>- Okay.</b>
<b>- It's kind of hard to explain.</b>

09:07.501 --> 09:09.542
<b>- Well, try.</b>

09:09.626 --> 09:11.459
<b>- You see, Budweiser's kind of</b>
<b>on the ropes.</b>

09:11.542 --> 09:12.584
<b>- Yeah.</b>

09:12.667 --> 09:14.042
<b>- You know, because of</b>
<b>all the small beer companies,</b>

09:14.125 --> 09:18.250
<b>all the new artisan beers out of</b>
<b>Portland that blew up a few years ago,</b>

09:18.334 --> 09:22.083
<b>especially in Brooklyn at all, you know,</b>
<b>the hipster places.</b>

09:22.167 --> 09:24.292
<b>And so the Bud distributors,</b>

09:24.375 --> 09:28.375
<b>they had to cut their prices</b>
<b>to even get those places to stock it.</b>

09:28.459 --> 09:30.083
<b>Now they're losing money.</b>
<b>- I see.</b>

09:30.167 --> 09:33.125
<b>So they're charging us more because</b>
<b>they know we have to pay it.</b>

09:33.209 --> 09:34.375
<b>- Yep.</b>

09:34.459 --> 09:36.042
<b>- Yeah, so we're getting penalized</b>
<b>for being loyal.</b>

09:36.125 --> 09:37.459
<b>- Yeah, that's exactly right.</b>

09:37.542 --> 09:40.083
<b>- Okay, well, see,</b>
<b>that's bad business, fellas.</b>

09:40.167 --> 09:43.792
<b>So, I mean, let's just start ordering</b>
<b>other beers, right?</b>

09:43.876 --> 09:45.584
<b>- Ah...</b>
<b>- I don't know.</b>

09:45.667 --> 09:46.876
<b>- You don't know what?</b>
<b>- Uh...</b>

09:46.959 --> 09:50.375
<b>- 'Cause we only serve Budweiser, okay?</b>
<b>That's it.</b>

09:50.459 --> 09:51.834
<b>That's the way it's always been.</b>

09:51.918 --> 09:53.209
<b>- Yeah, so what?</b>

09:53.292 --> 09:55.209
<b>- Well, you...</b>

09:55.292 --> 09:57.042
<b>Oh, uh...</b>

09:57.125 --> 10:00.792
<b>Just give me a minute, will you?</b>

10:02.000 --> 10:03.042
<b>- What is that about?</b>

10:03.125 --> 10:05.459
<b>- I don't know.</b>

10:05.542 --> 10:07.501
<b>- Okay, that's fine.</b>
<b>That's fine.</b>

10:07.584 --> 10:10.167
<b>I was just trying to connect with you,</b>

10:10.250 --> 10:15.584
<b>and I can see I just don't-- don't mean</b>
<b>a hang to you at all.</b>

10:15.667 --> 10:17.083
<b>But that's how it always is.</b>

10:17.167 --> 10:19.459
<b>See, that's what happens</b>
<b>when I reach out,</b>

10:19.542 --> 10:22.709
<b>I make myself vulnerable</b>
<b>to a new person.</b>

10:22.792 --> 10:23.876
<b>It's classic.</b>

10:23.959 --> 10:26.918
<b>I reach out,</b>
<b>I-- I-- I talk from my heart.</b>

10:27.000 --> 10:29.167
<b>I put my feelings on the line.</b>

10:29.250 --> 10:31.417
<b>And it's like I don't even exist.</b>

10:31.501 --> 10:33.792
<b>Like I was never born.</b>
<b>Right?</b>

10:33.876 --> 10:37.542
<b>Like my parents never met,</b>
<b>like they never had me</b>

10:37.626 --> 10:40.292
<b>or my-- my-- my-- or my brother.</b>

10:40.375 --> 10:42.292
<b>See, see, I'm-- I'm a person.</b>

10:42.375 --> 10:43.918
<b>I have a story, that's right.</b>

10:44.000 --> 10:47.792
<b>I either watch my brother every night</b>
<b>because they worked every night,</b>

10:47.876 --> 10:50.459
<b>and then one night,</b>
<b>they don't come home.</b>

10:50.542 --> 10:54.792
<b>So I took c-c-care of him, and now</b>
<b>my brother's happy and he's strong,</b>

10:54.876 --> 10:56.459
<b>because I raised him.</b>

10:56.542 --> 10:59.292
<b>I raised him good.</b>

10:59.375 --> 11:06.375
<b>And only two years older than him,</b>
<b>and now he doesn't t-t-talk to me.</b>

11:06.459 --> 11:08.000
<b>And l-l-look at me.</b>

11:08.083 --> 11:10.709
<b>I struggle, and so I appear weak,</b>

11:10.792 --> 11:14.334
<b>and people go,</b>
<b>no one wants to l-l-look at me.</b>

11:14.417 --> 11:16.000
<b>People don't want to look at the weak</b>

11:16.083 --> 11:18.626
<b>because it reminds them</b>
<b>of their own weakness.</b>

11:18.709 --> 11:21.250
<b>But what they don't get--</b>

11:21.334 --> 11:23.918
<b>What they don't get is that when</b>
<b>someone's struggling,</b>

11:24.000 --> 11:27.542
<b>it means he's strong, he's strong,</b>
<b>because the weak don't struggle.</b>

11:27.626 --> 11:29.417
<b>They just die.</b>

11:29.501 --> 11:32.459
<b>So whatever you think of me,</b>

11:32.542 --> 11:34.459
<b>I’m alive.</b>

11:34.542 --> 11:36.417
<b>I’m alive.</b>

11:36.501 --> 11:38.042
<b>So go ahead.</b>

11:38.125 --> 11:40.751
<b>Ignore me, go about your day,</b>

11:40.834 --> 11:44.959
<b>even though I’m the one</b>
<b>who made you feel special.</b>

11:45.042 --> 11:47.501
<b>Just like my brother,</b>
<b>just like my brother.</b>

11:47.584 --> 11:51.167
<b>When I gave him the strength</b>
<b>to neglect me.</b>

11:51.250 --> 11:55.834
<b>I put you on a pedestal</b>
<b>and now you can't see me.</b>

11:55.918 --> 11:57.834
<b>But-- And so, fine.</b>

11:57.918 --> 12:01.167
<b>So do what--</b>
<b>Do whatever you want!</b>

12:01.250 --> 12:02.792
<b>It's just typical.</b>

12:02.876 --> 12:07.083
<b>I've come to expect it.</b>

12:07.167 --> 12:12.000
<b>- Okay, then.</b>
<b>You have a great day.</b>

12:12.083 --> 12:14.751
<b>- So you still talk to, uh, Maxie?</b>

12:14.834 --> 12:16.792
<b>- Maxie?</b>

12:16.876 --> 12:19.459
<b>- Yeah, he was the tall guy?</b>
<b>Remember?</b>

12:19.542 --> 12:21.542
<b>He went out with Rachel Hunter.</b>

12:21.626 --> 12:25.209
<b>- Oh jeez, Pete.</b>
<b>Maxie died years ago.</b>

12:25.292 --> 12:27.209
<b>- Ah, shit.</b>

12:27.292 --> 12:30.876
<b>I didn’t know.</b>

12:30.959 --> 12:33.167
<b>Yeah, I got kind of a patchy past,</b>
<b>you know?</b>

12:33.250 --> 12:38.792
<b>I got like high school</b>
<b>and then I got 10 years ago.</b>

12:38.876 --> 12:41.167
<b>- Why’s that?</b>

12:41.250 --> 12:43.792
<b>Were you in the joint or something?</b>

12:43.876 --> 12:45.792
<b>- Yeah, or something.</b>

12:45.876 --> 12:48.250
<b>- Pete was in a mental health facility.</b>

12:48.334 --> 12:51.792
<b>It's not funny, Dom.</b>
<b>He was gone a long time.</b>

12:51.876 --> 12:54.834
<b>- Sorry.</b>

12:54.918 --> 12:57.501
<b>- He got medicated</b>
<b>and he got out.</b>

12:57.584 --> 13:00.918
<b>We've been friends since school.</b>

13:01.000 --> 13:02.876
<b>- Whatever.</b>
<b>Sorry.</b>

13:02.959 --> 13:06.042
<b>- Yeah. Yeah.</b>

13:06.125 --> 13:07.918
<b>So what's up, Pete?</b>

13:08.000 --> 13:09.584
<b>- Well, listen.</b>

13:09.667 --> 13:13.667
<b>I remember last time I saw you, you told</b>
<b>me that you were on the mayor’s detail.</b>

13:13.751 --> 13:16.792
<b>Is that still, uh...?</b>
<b>- Yeah, still.</b>

13:16.876 --> 13:18.834
<b>- Still, still.</b>

13:18.918 --> 13:23.083
<b>We drive behind him and then he goes</b>
<b>there and then he goes here.</b>

13:23.167 --> 13:25.792
<b>(clears throat)</b>
<b>It's fucking boring.</b>

13:25.876 --> 13:28.167
<b>- Eh, I don't mind it too much.</b>

13:28.250 --> 13:33.501
<b>- Well, the reason I--</b>
<b>- I know you don't mind it.</b>

13:33.584 --> 13:35.834
<b>- The reason I’m asking is, um...</b>

13:35.918 --> 13:37.459
<b>- What's up, Pete?</b>

13:37.542 --> 13:41.626
<b>- Well, so this place,</b>
<b>you know, the bar.</b>

13:41.709 --> 13:45.292
<b>We've been having a tough time,</b>
<b>and so I've been, um...</b>

13:45.375 --> 13:50.959
<b>Uh, well, I've-- I've applied</b>
<b>to have it declared a landmark.</b>

13:51.042 --> 13:54.626
<b>This way it would make it harder</b>
<b>to shut it down, you know?</b>

13:54.709 --> 13:57.459
<b>And, uh...</b>
<b>- Hey, what's the big secret?</b>

13:57.542 --> 14:00.209
<b>Why are we-- why are we doing--</b>
<b>being all quiet?</b>

14:00.292 --> 14:02.834
<b>- Well, because...</b>

14:02.918 --> 14:04.876
<b>- Because what?</b>
<b>- Listen, Dom.</b>

14:04.959 --> 14:08.542
<b>- What?</b>
<b>- Can you give us a minute?</b>

14:08.626 --> 14:11.334
<b>- Well, pardon me all over</b>
<b>the fucking joint.</b>

14:20.959 --> 14:22.459
<b>- What's up, Pete?</b>
<b>Talk to me.</b>

14:22.542 --> 14:24.542
<b>- Well...</b>

14:24.626 --> 14:28.125
<b>Sylvia, she's trying to shut</b>
<b>the place down.</b>

14:28.209 --> 14:31.334
<b>I mean, she's been working here and,</b>
<b>you know, we're trying to make it work,</b>

14:31.417 --> 14:35.834
<b>but I know she still has her sights</b>
<b>on flushing the place for cash,</b>

14:35.918 --> 14:38.083
<b>so I thought maybe this is a way to,</b>

14:38.167 --> 14:41.167
<b>you know, make it</b>
<b>so that she can't sell it.</b>

14:41.250 --> 14:43.417
<b>- So why are you telling me?</b>

14:43.501 --> 14:46.542
<b>- Well, so I've applied for, you know,</b>
<b>the landmark status,</b>

14:46.626 --> 14:48.459
<b>but I mean, it's a real bitch to--</b>

14:48.542 --> 14:50.375
<b>I mean, it's like</b>
<b>the worst kind of paperwork</b>

14:50.459 --> 14:53.417
<b>and then the waiting</b>
<b>and it's like impossible.</b>

14:53.501 --> 14:56.209
<b>So I thought maybe...</b>

14:56.292 --> 14:58.292
<b>I don't know, if you could--</b>

14:58.375 --> 14:59.959
<b>Uh, since you ride around</b>
<b>with the mayor,</b>

15:00.042 --> 15:02.167
<b>if you can get him to come here,</b>
<b>you know?</b>

15:02.250 --> 15:04.834
<b>And then if he sees the place</b>
<b>and then, you know,</b>

15:04.918 --> 15:06.876
<b>that could move our application up</b>
<b>on the pile, you know?</b>

15:06.959 --> 15:10.334
<b>- Wow, Pete.</b>
<b>I mean, I don't know.</b>

15:10.417 --> 15:14.042
<b>And of all the favors that I get asked</b>
<b>as being a cop,</b>

15:14.125 --> 15:18.375
<b>that's the least offensive,</b>
<b>but I don't tell the mayor where to go.</b>

15:18.459 --> 15:20.667
<b>I just follow him around, you know?</b>

15:20.751 --> 15:23.834
<b>- I know, I know.</b>
<b>I just thought if you, you know,</b>

15:23.918 --> 15:27.959
<b>find yourself, you know, cruising around</b>
<b>Brooklyn with the mayor</b>

15:28.042 --> 15:31.292
<b>and-- and he's got a minute</b>
<b>and he ever says,</b>

15:31.375 --> 15:34.167
<b>hey, where can a guy get a beer</b>
<b>around here?</b>

15:34.250 --> 15:36.667
<b>And then you can go,</b>
<b>I know of a place, Your Honor.</b>

15:36.751 --> 15:38.709
<b>You know?</b>
<b>That's all I’m asking.</b>

15:38.792 --> 15:41.125
<b>- Wow, Pete, man.</b>

15:41.209 --> 15:43.542
<b>That's a long shot you're taking there.</b>

15:43.626 --> 15:45.209
<b>- Well, it's the only one I got.</b>

15:45.292 --> 15:48.834
<b>- Man...</b>
<b>Well, hey, man, I don't know.</b>

15:48.918 --> 15:53.834
<b>It may never happen, but if I find</b>
<b>myself in that exact situation,</b>

15:53.918 --> 15:57.334
<b>I will say exactly that, okay?</b>

15:57.417 --> 16:00.083
<b>- All right.</b>
<b>Well, thanks, Ricardo, I appreciate it.</b>

16:00.167 --> 16:02.876
<b>- Oh, hey, you did a lot for me</b>
<b>as a kid.</b>

16:02.959 --> 16:04.876
<b>- I did?</b>

16:04.959 --> 16:07.000
<b>- Yeah.</b>

16:07.083 --> 16:13.751
<b>Yeah, even as a grown-up, I never found</b>
<b>a friend that did for me what you did.</b>

16:13.834 --> 16:17.918
<b>Yeah, we were kids,</b>
<b>but you stuck up for me.</b>

16:18.000 --> 16:19.918
<b>You know.</b>

16:20.000 --> 16:22.542
<b>I was sad when you went away.</b>

16:22.626 --> 16:25.042
<b>And when I heard you got out,</b>

16:25.125 --> 16:28.959
<b>I came around a lot to try and catch up</b>
<b>with you, you know.</b>

16:29.042 --> 16:31.209
<b>- I know.</b>
<b>- I wanted to be there for you now...</b>

16:31.292 --> 16:33.834
<b>- Yeah, but...</b>

16:33.918 --> 16:35.876
<b>I don't know, it was just kinda--</b>
<b>It was tough.</b>

16:35.959 --> 16:40.292
<b>It was tough facing everybody,</b>
<b>and you know, I was all changed.</b>

16:40.375 --> 16:42.292
<b>- Yeah.</b>
<b>- I don't know, just...</b>

16:42.375 --> 16:44.626
<b>- Yeah, I get it.</b>
<b>I get it.</b>

16:44.709 --> 16:48.626
<b>Hey, man, I was happy that you--</b>
<b>that you reached out.</b>

16:48.709 --> 16:50.918
<b>In fact, I was glad that you called.</b>

16:51.000 --> 16:53.334
<b>And I hope I could do this</b>
<b>for you.</b>

16:53.417 --> 16:56.751
<b>- All right. Thanks.</b>

16:56.834 --> 16:59.501
<b>- It's good to see you.</b>
<b>- You too, you too, Ricardo, thank you.</b>

16:59.584 --> 17:01.876
<b>I'll see you.</b>
<b>- All right.</b>

17:01.959 --> 17:03.709
<b>(knocking)</b>

17:03.792 --> 17:05.584
<b>- Come on, Dom.</b>

17:05.666 --> 17:09.250
<b>- Great.</b>

17:09.334 --> 17:11.334
<b>Really good getting to know you guys.</b>

17:24.626 --> 17:26.041
<b>- Was that...</b>

17:26.125 --> 17:27.459
<b>Ricky Vonn?</b>

17:27.541 --> 17:29.042
<b>- Yeah.</b>

17:29.125 --> 17:30.918
<b>- What was going on there?</b>

17:31.000 --> 17:33.542
<b>- Just catching up.</b>

17:33.626 --> 17:35.918
<b>- Catching up.</b>
<b>(door opens)</b>

17:36.000 --> 17:39.834
<b>- Horace.</b>

17:39.918 --> 17:42.083
<b>- Oh.</b>

17:42.167 --> 17:43.459
<b>Hey.</b>

17:43.542 --> 17:46.501
<b>- Hi, Dad.</b>

17:46.584 --> 17:48.459
<b>I’m fine.</b>
<b>Hi, Pete.</b>

17:48.542 --> 17:50.375
<b>- Hey, it's good to see you.</b>

17:50.459 --> 17:51.918
<b>- Hi, honey, it's so nice to see you.</b>

17:52.000 --> 17:53.709
<b>- Hi, Sylvia.</b>
<b>How are you?</b>

17:53.792 --> 17:55.250
<b>Are you doing okay?</b>

17:55.334 --> 17:56.959
<b>- Oh, yeah, I’m fine, I'm fine.</b>

17:57.042 --> 18:00.000
<b>- Good.</b>
<b>This is Eric, by the way.</b>

18:00.083 --> 18:03.417
<b>Eric, this is my dad, Horace, and Pete.</b>

18:03.501 --> 18:05.209
<b>And my aunt, Sylvia.</b>

18:05.292 --> 18:06.709
<b>- Hey, hi.</b>
<b>How you doing?</b>

18:06.792 --> 18:07.959
<b>How's it going?</b>

18:08.042 --> 18:09.918
<b>- How are you?</b>
<b>- Hi, nice to meet you.</b>

18:10.000 --> 18:12.959
<b>- How's it going?</b>

18:13.042 --> 18:14.709
<b>I’m just-- I’m gonna do this.</b>

18:14.792 --> 18:16.459
<b>- Okay.</b>

18:16.542 --> 18:18.876
<b>- It's nice to meet you, Eric.</b>

18:18.959 --> 18:20.083
<b>Boyfriend?</b>

18:20.167 --> 18:21.501
<b>- Uh, yeah.</b>

18:21.584 --> 18:25.792
<b>Um, I mean, I haven't been officially</b>
<b>title-fied as such,</b>

18:25.876 --> 18:30.000
<b>but, you know, I'm kinda getting</b>
<b>the sense that I'm--</b>

18:30.083 --> 18:35.000
<b>I'm-- I'm her boyfriend.</b>

18:35.083 --> 18:38.626
<b>- Yeah, I think so.</b>
<b>(chuckling)</b>

18:38.709 --> 18:45.250
<b>Gotcha.</b>
<b>Okay, it's nice to meet you.</b>

18:45.334 --> 18:46.584
<b>- You wanna have a seat?</b>

18:46.667 --> 18:47.959
<b>- Yeah.</b>
<b>- Yeah.</b>

18:48.042 --> 18:49.209
<b>- Okay.</b>

19:01.209 --> 19:03.584
<b>So, uh...</b>

19:03.667 --> 19:05.876
<b>Eric?</b>
<b>- Yeah.</b>

19:05.959 --> 19:08.083
<b>- Did you guys meet in school or...?</b>
<b>- Yep.</b>

19:08.167 --> 19:14.083
<b>- Yeah, we were on opposite sides of</b>
<b>a mock case, and she beat my ass.</b>

19:14.167 --> 19:15.959
<b>- Yeah, I did.</b>

19:16.042 --> 19:17.459
<b>- I had no shot.</b>

19:17.542 --> 19:18.667
<b>She's really good.</b>

19:18.751 --> 19:19.876
<b>- Yeah.</b>

19:19.959 --> 19:22.918
<b>- I figured, better be a better lawyer,</b>

19:23.000 --> 19:25.209
<b>or, you know,</b>
<b>I could just marry this one.</b>

19:25.292 --> 19:27.209
<b>- Oh, I didn't--</b>
<b>I didn't know that--</b>

19:27.292 --> 19:28.542
<b>- Oh, no.</b>
<b>No, no, no, no, no.</b>

19:28.626 --> 19:29.709
<b>I mean--</b>

19:29.792 --> 19:31.667
<b>No, I just-- Not--</b>

19:31.751 --> 19:34.000
<b>In the-- in the moment, it--</b>

19:34.083 --> 19:35.209
<b>You know, I thought...</b>

19:35.292 --> 19:36.459
<b>But now, I mean, of course.</b>

19:36.542 --> 19:38.209
<b>- Now, now that he knows me,</b>

19:38.292 --> 19:40.542
<b>he knows he would never marry me.</b>

19:40.626 --> 19:42.501
<b>- No, I mean, I don't--</b>

19:42.584 --> 19:44.542
<b>I would--</b>
<b>I don't know if I would, but...</b>

19:44.626 --> 19:47.209
<b>- Nobody's asking, Eric.</b>
<b>It's fine.</b>

19:47.292 --> 19:48.876
<b>- I just-- I just mean that--</b>

19:48.959 --> 19:52.083
<b>It's not that I’m not thinking,</b>
<b>but it's still very--</b>

19:52.167 --> 19:54.709
<b>I’m--</b>
<b>(sighs)</b>

19:54.792 --> 19:56.667
<b>She-- she messes me up really bad.</b>

19:56.751 --> 19:58.167
<b>- Yes, it's very cute.</b>

19:58.250 --> 19:59.792
<b>- Isn't it?</b>
<b>- It's all very cute.</b>

19:59.876 --> 20:03.417
<b>- Yeah.</b>

20:03.501 --> 20:04.834
<b>- So, uh...</b>

20:04.918 --> 20:07.334
<b>You liked her because she beat you.</b>

20:07.417 --> 20:10.125
<b>And then why did you--</b>
<b>What did you like about him?</b>

20:10.209 --> 20:11.626
<b>- I guess...</b>

20:11.709 --> 20:14.209
<b>because I beat him.</b>

20:14.292 --> 20:16.042
<b>- Ha ha ha ha ha!</b>
<b>Ha!</b>

20:16.125 --> 20:19.042
<b>Yeah, you know, I guess it's good,</b>
<b>you know, early on,</b>

20:19.125 --> 20:24.626
<b>to, you know, really know that you have</b>
<b>no shot with somebody in an argument,</b>

20:24.709 --> 20:26.584
<b>really, in the relationship.</b>

20:26.667 --> 20:28.292
<b>Ha. Yeah.</b>

20:28.375 --> 20:30.918
<b>(chuckles)</b>
<b>Um...</b>

20:31.000 --> 20:33.501
<b>Am I-- am I-- am I annoying you?</b>

20:33.584 --> 20:34.667
<b>- No.</b>
<b>- Right now?</b>

20:34.751 --> 20:36.292
<b>- No, no, it's--</b>

20:36.375 --> 20:40.834
<b>It's annoying to me that my father</b>
<b>makes you nervous,</b>

20:40.918 --> 20:45.417
<b>because if you knew him personally,</b>
<b>you would not care what he thinks.</b>

20:45.501 --> 20:48.918
<b>- Okay, uh,</b>
<b>don't know what to say to that.</b>

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
<b>(nervous laugh)</b>

20:52.083 --> 20:55.667
<b>Yeah, I don't, uh, don't know how to--</b>
<b>don't know how to respond to that.</b>

20:55.751 --> 20:59.042
<b>- Yeah, me neither, buddy.</b>

20:59.125 --> 21:01.834
<b>- Sorry, guys.</b>

21:01.918 --> 21:05.125
<b>- I am nervous,</b>
<b>but it's not because of him.</b>

21:05.209 --> 21:06.501
<b>I...</b>

21:06.584 --> 21:09.918
<b>I’m nervous because he's your dad</b>
<b>and that's... important.</b>

21:10.000 --> 21:12.209
<b>I’m nervous because of you,</b>
<b>not because of him.</b>

21:12.292 --> 21:16.000
<b>- Oh, my God.</b>

21:16.083 --> 21:20.083
<b>Um... well...</b>

21:20.167 --> 21:21.792
<b>- Yeah, I-- I have to go.</b>

21:21.876 --> 21:23.042
<b>- Okay, all right.</b>

21:23.125 --> 21:25.167
<b>- Okay.</b>
<b>- I'll see you in a bit.</b>

21:25.250 --> 21:26.751
<b>- Nice to meet you.</b>

21:26.834 --> 21:28.626
<b>- Yes, nice meeting you.</b>
<b>- If you say so.</b>

21:28.709 --> 21:35.000
<b>- Yeah.</b>
<b>- Bye.</b>

21:35.083 --> 21:37.417
<b>- Well, um...</b>

21:37.501 --> 21:40.167
<b>(chuckling)</b>

21:40.250 --> 21:41.417
<b>He seems like a--</b>

21:41.501 --> 21:43.501
<b>Seems like a nice guy.</b>

21:43.584 --> 21:45.334
<b>- He is a nice guy, he's a good guy.</b>

21:45.417 --> 21:48.000
<b>- Good.</b>

21:48.083 --> 21:49.584
<b>So what are you...?</b>

21:49.667 --> 21:51.876
<b>- What am I what?</b>

21:51.959 --> 21:54.209
<b>- Well, you know.</b>

21:54.292 --> 21:56.167
<b>Be careful.</b>

21:56.250 --> 21:58.375
<b>- Um, I don't know.</b>

21:58.459 --> 22:00.751
<b>What do you mean?</b>

22:00.834 --> 22:04.000
<b>Dad, what do you mean?</b>

22:04.083 --> 22:07.375
<b>- I just mean that, um...</b>

22:07.459 --> 22:08.709
<b>Well, are you gonna move in together?</b>

22:08.792 --> 22:11.375
<b>- No, we just started dating.</b>

22:11.459 --> 22:12.584
<b>- All right.</b>

22:12.667 --> 22:14.792
<b>Well, go slow.</b>
<b>That's all I’m saying.</b>

22:14.876 --> 22:16.125
<b>- Okay.</b>

22:16.209 --> 22:18.751
<b>What makes you think</b>
<b>I'm trying to rush things?</b>

22:18.834 --> 22:22.584
<b>- Well, your situation, you know,</b>
<b>you don't have a place to live, so...</b>

22:22.667 --> 22:25.709
<b>- Okay, so you think that</b>
<b>I got a boyfriend</b>

22:25.792 --> 22:28.167
<b>so I'll have a place to live?</b>

22:28.250 --> 22:29.334
<b>Is this...</b>

22:29.417 --> 22:33.417
<b>Is this because you want me</b>
<b>to move in here?</b>

22:33.501 --> 22:35.250
<b>- Huh?</b>
<b>No, no, no, no.</b>

22:35.334 --> 22:36.751
<b>I mean, Sylvia's living here now.</b>

22:36.834 --> 22:38.542
<b>- She is?</b>

22:38.626 --> 22:40.626
<b>- Yeah, she's--</b>
<b>she lives upstairs in her old room</b>

22:40.709 --> 22:43.250
<b>and I'm helping her,</b>
<b>I'm taking her to treatments</b>

22:43.334 --> 22:45.167
<b>and she's-- and she's working here.</b>

22:45.250 --> 22:47.584
<b>- Wow.</b>

22:47.667 --> 22:52.042
<b>- No, I’m just saying that, you know,</b>
<b>you're in the middle of your education,</b>

22:52.125 --> 22:54.626
<b>so, uh, you should just be careful.</b>

22:54.709 --> 22:57.626
<b>- I just--</b>
<b>What in your mind does that even mean?</b>

22:57.709 --> 23:00.918
<b>- Well, a woman your age</b>
<b>who's in college...</b>

23:01.000 --> 23:02.709
<b>- Law school, Dad.</b>

23:02.792 --> 23:04.042
<b>- Right.</b>

23:04.125 --> 23:05.709
<b>I’m just saying, it's your life</b>

23:05.792 --> 23:08.459
<b>and your career that you've worked</b>
<b>really hard for,</b>

23:08.542 --> 23:11.209
<b>and I just don't want you to--</b>

23:11.292 --> 23:16.375
<b>let your life be absorbed into his life,</b>
<b>you know?</b>

23:16.459 --> 23:18.375
<b>Well, that's a legitimate concern.</b>

23:18.459 --> 23:20.501
<b>- I mean, maybe.</b>

23:20.584 --> 23:24.125
<b>Maybe in like 1982 or something,</b>

23:24.209 --> 23:27.250
<b>but I feel like women have made</b>
<b>some progress, you know?</b>

23:27.334 --> 23:28.876
<b>- I don't know, I...</b>

23:28.959 --> 23:30.959
<b>- No, you don't know.</b>
<b>That's the thing.</b>

23:31.042 --> 23:32.626
<b>- Look...</b>

23:32.709 --> 23:36.167
<b>Alice, first of all, you weren't alive</b>
<b>in 1982, okay?</b>

23:36.250 --> 23:37.542
<b>I was.</b>

23:37.626 --> 23:40.792
<b>And I've known women longer than</b>
<b>you've been a woman.</b>

23:40.876 --> 23:42.083
<b>- Oh, my God.</b>

23:42.167 --> 23:43.584
<b>- I'm sorry, it's true.</b>

23:43.667 --> 23:49.876
<b>You've been an adult for four years</b>
<b>and I've got 50 on you, okay?</b>

23:49.959 --> 23:51.417
<b>I mean, I’m 50.</b>

23:51.501 --> 23:53.417
<b>I'll go 42.</b>
<b>(Alice laughs)</b>

23:53.501 --> 23:57.918
<b>The point is, I have knowledge</b>
<b>that you can benefit from.</b>

23:58.000 --> 24:00.292
<b>- But can you see how this is</b>
<b>condescending?</b>

24:00.375 --> 24:01.959
<b>Like you're being very condescending.</b>

24:02.042 --> 24:03.584
<b>- I don't mean to be condescending,</b>
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

24:03.667 --> 24:06.459
<b>I’m not trying to be condescending.</b>

24:06.542 --> 24:08.709
<b>No, you know what? I am.</b>
<b>I am trying to be condescending.</b>

24:08.792 --> 24:10.083
<b>Why--</b>

24:10.167 --> 24:12.792
<b>Why can't I condescend to you?</b>
<b>I’m your father.</b>

24:12.876 --> 24:14.125
<b>- Barely.</b>

24:14.209 --> 24:18.375
<b>- I'm older than you</b>
<b>and I’m taller than you, okay?</b>

24:18.459 --> 24:21.125
<b>Why--</b>
<b>Can't anybody condescend to anyone?</b>

24:21.209 --> 24:24.626
<b>Does everyone have to talk to each other</b>
<b>on an equal level?</b>

24:24.709 --> 24:26.876
<b>Can't a pumpkin condescend</b>
<b>to a peanut?</b>

24:26.959 --> 24:28.709
<b>When a pumpkin meets a peanut,</b>
<b>does he have to say,</b>

24:28.792 --> 24:31.375
<b>oh, you're totally the same size</b>
<b>as me, peanut.</b>

24:31.459 --> 24:34.334
<b>- Okay. Okay.</b>
<b>I got it.</b>

24:34.417 --> 24:35.751
<b>- Okay?</b>
<b>- Okay, yes.</b>

24:35.834 --> 24:38.167
<b>- All right.</b>

24:38.250 --> 24:40.709
<b>- Are you okay?</b>

24:40.792 --> 24:42.876
<b>- Yeah, I am.</b>
<b>I’m good.</b>

24:42.959 --> 24:45.375
<b>- Good.</b>
<b>- Yeah.</b>

24:45.459 --> 24:47.584
<b>- And so, I can't--</b>

24:47.667 --> 24:48.918
<b>Sylvia is working down here?</b>

24:49.000 --> 24:50.250
<b>- Yeah.</b>

24:50.334 --> 24:52.667
<b>- But I thought she wanted to shut</b>
<b>the place down.</b>

24:52.751 --> 24:56.876
<b>- Well, she works here and, you know,</b>
<b>its hers, partly, too, so...</b>

24:56.959 --> 24:58.000
<b>No.</b>

24:58.083 --> 25:01.542
<b>- But is it nice having her here?</b>

25:01.626 --> 25:03.083
<b>- Yeah.</b>

25:03.167 --> 25:04.751
<b>And no.</b>
<b>But yeah.</b>

25:04.834 --> 25:07.751
<b>- 'Cause it seems like</b>
<b>it would be intense.</b>

25:07.834 --> 25:09.083
<b>Like, is it?</b>

25:09.167 --> 25:13.292
<b>- Well, you know, Sylvia can be</b>
<b>very harsh and she can be tough and...</b>

25:13.375 --> 25:17.083
<b>Um, but I--</b>
<b>It doesn't bother me.</b>

25:17.167 --> 25:18.709
<b>She's family.</b>

25:18.792 --> 25:21.334
<b>- Okay. Good.</b>

25:21.417 --> 25:23.125
<b>- Yeah.</b>

25:23.209 --> 25:25.709
<b>- Well, I gotta go, okay?</b>

25:25.792 --> 25:26.959
<b>- Okay.</b>

25:27.042 --> 25:29.501
<b>Hey, thanks for bringing--</b>
<b>bringing him by.</b>

25:29.584 --> 25:31.167
<b>- Yeah, I--</b>

25:31.250 --> 25:33.959
<b>I don't know. I wanted to.</b>
<b>- Okay.</b>

25:34.042 --> 25:37.834
<b>- Um... bye.</b>
<b>- Bye.</b>

25:37.918 --> 25:40.792
<b>- Uh, bye, Sylvie.</b>
<b>- Oh, bye, sweetie.</b>

25:40.876 --> 25:43.834
<b>- Hey, uh, I hope you're okay, you know?</b>

25:43.918 --> 25:49.667
<b>Good luck with the thing, 'cause, um,</b>
<b>my friend's mom died from it last year,</b>

25:49.751 --> 25:56.959
<b>so I hope that you'll be fine.</b>

25:57.042 --> 25:58.751
<b>- All right.</b>
<b>(clears throat)</b>

25:58.834 --> 26:00.918
<b>Well, I'm gonna go.</b>
<b>(door opens)</b>

26:01.000 --> 26:02.834
<b>Brenda's gonna meet me</b>
<b>at Sloan Kettering,</b>

26:02.918 --> 26:04.459
<b>and I'm gonna stay with her tonight.</b>

26:04.542 --> 26:05.792
<b>- Oh.</b>

26:05.876 --> 26:07.542
<b>- Yeah, I'm getting some...</b>

26:07.626 --> 26:09.209
<b>test results.</b>

26:09.292 --> 26:10.959
<b>They say I had to be there in person.</b>

26:11.042 --> 26:14.000
<b>For some reason, they can't e-mail it--</b>
<b>e-mail it to me, you know.</b>

26:14.083 --> 26:17.250
<b>"You're dead," so I can get on with my</b>
<b>life, so anyway, I'll see you tomorrow.</b>

26:17.334 --> 26:19.209
<b>- Okay.</b>
<b>I hope it's good, I hope it's good.</b>

26:19.292 --> 26:21.709
<b>- All right.</b>
<b>See you then.</b>

26:21.792 --> 26:23.501
<b>Bye, Pete.</b>

26:23.584 --> 26:24.834
<b>- Bye, Syl.</b>

26:24.918 --> 26:30.959
<b>(door opens, then closes)</b>

26:31.042 --> 26:36.626
<b>(ice cubes clinking)</b>

26:36.709 --> 26:38.209
<b>(woman clears throat)</b>

26:48.792 --> 26:50.918
<b>- You own the place?</b>

26:51.000 --> 26:53.751
<b>- Yeah, how'd you guess?</b>

26:53.834 --> 27:00.751
<b>- You walk around</b>
<b>like you own the place.</b>

27:00.834 --> 27:03.250
<b>I wasn't crying about anything.</b>

27:03.334 --> 27:04.626
<b>- I’m sorry?</b>

27:04.709 --> 27:08.459
<b>- I know you saw me crying.</b>
<b>It wasn't about anything.</b>

27:08.542 --> 27:10.417
<b>- Okay.</b>

27:10.501 --> 27:12.751
<b>- You were just, uh, cleaning your eyes,</b>
<b>I guess?</b>

27:12.834 --> 27:14.501
<b>(chuckles)</b>
<b>- Yeah.</b>

27:14.584 --> 27:16.167
<b>I was cleaning my eyes, that's all.</b>

27:16.250 --> 27:17.542
<b>(Horace clears throat)</b>
<b>- I do it all the time.</b>

27:17.626 --> 27:25.042
<b>- So do I.</b>

27:25.125 --> 27:27.709
<b>- Can I buy you a drink?</b>

27:27.792 --> 27:30.167
<b>- If you want to.</b>

27:30.250 --> 27:31.876
<b>- Hey, Pete, can you...?</b>

27:48.042 --> 27:52.167
<b>Thanks.</b>
<b>- Mm-hmm.</b>

27:52.250 --> 27:53.918
<b>- Uh, to--</b>
<b>- Thanks for the drink.</b>

27:54.000 --> 27:55.292
<b>- Okay.</b>

28:02.626 --> 28:05.959
<b>- You probably think I was crying</b>
<b>about a man somewhere?</b>

<b>- So you think trans people are deluded,</b>
<b>that they're wrong,</b>

39:40.000 --> 39:43.083
<b>but we should just be nice to them</b>
<b>and let them believe it.</b>

39:43.167 --> 39:44.626
<b>- Nah, I don't--</b>
<b>I don't think that, that's not--</b>

39:44.709 --> 39:46.751
<b>- Okay, sorry.</b>

39:46.834 --> 39:52.667
<b>So you think that they should be treated</b>
<b>like women even though they're not.</b>

39:52.751 --> 39:56.542
<b>- I just think that...</b>

39:56.626 --> 39:59.334
<b>legally...</b>

39:59.417 --> 40:01.167
<b>you know, like the Constitution,</b>

40:01.250 --> 40:02.834
<b>I think they should have</b>
<b>the same rights,</b>

40:02.918 --> 40:04.751
<b>I think they should</b>
<b>have the same rights.</b>

40:04.834 --> 40:06.626
<b>- And by rights, you mean...</b>

40:06.709 --> 40:08.626
<b>using the toilet, applying for a job.</b>

40:08.709 --> 40:12.334
<b>- Yeah, or-- Well, I mean, and,</b>
<b>you know, getting married.</b>

40:12.417 --> 40:13.584
<b>Gay people can get married.</b>

40:13.667 --> 40:14.792
<b>I think that's great that gay people</b>
<b>can get married.</b>

40:14.876 --> 40:17.083
<b>- We're not talking about gay people.</b>
<b>- No, I know.</b>

40:17.167 --> 40:22.334
<b>- Look, do you think that a guy</b>
<b>who transitions into being a woman</b>

40:22.417 --> 40:26.709
<b>should be able to marry a man</b>
<b>in a heterosexual marriage?</b>

40:26.792 --> 40:28.542
<b>- Yeah, sure.</b>

40:28.626 --> 40:30.334
<b>Yes.</b>
<b>- Okay.</b>

40:30.417 --> 40:32.417
<b>So who's the guy?</b>
<b>Who marries--</b>

40:32.501 --> 40:34.042
<b>Who marries her?</b>

40:34.125 --> 40:40.834
<b>- A guy who has that preference,</b>
<b>who likes that.</b>

40:40.918 --> 40:44.000
<b>- Okay.</b>

40:44.083 --> 40:49.417
<b>So you think that, um, a man who has</b>
<b>sex with a transgender woman</b>

40:49.501 --> 40:52.751
<b>is a sexual preference?</b>

40:52.834 --> 40:55.000
<b>- Yes?</b>

40:55.083 --> 40:56.292
<b>Yes.</b>

40:56.375 --> 40:57.709
<b>Yes, I do think so.</b>

40:57.792 --> 40:59.501
<b>That's...</b>

40:59.584 --> 41:03.125
<b>- So a-- so a person who is born</b>
<b>a woman in a male body...</b>

41:03.209 --> 41:04.334
<b>- Mm-hmm.</b>

41:04.417 --> 41:07.459
<b>- ...who transitions and becomes</b>
<b>a female</b>

41:07.542 --> 41:10.459
<b>is only allowed to have sex</b>
<b>with someone who specifically gets off</b>

41:10.542 --> 41:12.334
<b>on fucking transgender people?</b>

41:12.417 --> 41:17.501
<b>She can't--</b>
<b>she can't just be herself?</b>

41:17.584 --> 41:19.542
<b>And just-- just live her life?</b>

41:19.626 --> 41:22.167
<b>She can't meet men, date men,</b>
<b>fuck men, marry men.</b>

41:22.250 --> 41:25.542
<b>Just like a woman</b>
<b>who was born a woman.</b>

41:25.626 --> 41:28.209
<b>I mean, she can apply for a job,</b>
<b>she can serve her country,</b>

41:28.292 --> 41:30.542
<b>she can use the toilet.</b>

41:30.626 --> 41:33.000
<b>But she can't...</b>

41:33.083 --> 41:39.167
<b>do the one thing that makes her</b>
<b>a woman, she can't fuck men.</b>

41:39.250 --> 41:43.334
<b>Unless they're freaks who dig chicks</b>
<b>that used to have dicks.</b>

41:43.417 --> 41:46.334
<b>- Uh...</b>

41:46.417 --> 41:49.959
<b>No, I...</b>

41:50.042 --> 41:53.542
<b>Well, that's her, right?</b>

41:53.626 --> 41:54.918
<b>So then...</b>

41:55.000 --> 41:58.375
<b>Okay.</b>

41:58.459 --> 41:59.876
<b>All right, well, let's say for instance,</b>

41:59.959 --> 42:02.250
<b>let's say that you were--</b>
<font color = #FFFFFF><b>used to be a guy.</b></font>

42:02.334 --> 42:04.876
<b>- Okay.</b>

42:04.959 --> 42:06.542
<b>- If you-- Okay.</b>

42:06.626 --> 42:10.167
<b>If you were, if you used to be a guy,</b>

42:10.250 --> 42:13.375
<b>I think, I mean,</b>
<b>you would have an obligation</b>

42:13.459 --> 42:15.542
<b>to tell somebody you're gonna be with.</b>

42:15.626 --> 42:18.167
<b>- Why?</b>

42:18.250 --> 42:25.918
<b>- Because a guy, like for instance me,</b>

42:26.000 --> 42:30.834
<b>has a right to know if he's having sex</b>
<b>with a man because I'm not gay.</b>

42:30.918 --> 42:33.167
<b>- Do you think you had sex</b>
<b>with a man last night?</b>

42:33.250 --> 42:39.042
<b>- No, I-- I assume I didn't.</b>

42:39.125 --> 42:40.709
<b>Because you would have to--</b>

42:40.792 --> 42:42.250
<b>You would have to tell somebody</b>
<b>a thing like that.</b>

42:42.334 --> 42:44.375
<b>- Well, but you didn't ask me</b>
<b>before we had sex.</b>

42:44.459 --> 42:47.792
<b>You just told me about your big,</b>
<b>special penis and invited me upstairs.</b>

42:47.876 --> 42:49.083
<b>- But you don't have to--</b>

42:49.167 --> 42:51.375
<b>You don't have to--</b>
<b>You don't have to--</b>

42:51.459 --> 42:55.834
<b>You don't have to ask people, which one</b>
<b>are you, before you get started.</b>

42:55.918 --> 42:57.000
<b>It's just--</b>

42:57.083 --> 42:58.209
<b>A person has the right to assume</b>
<b>certain things.</b>

42:58.292 --> 43:01.250
<b>- Did I have the right to assume</b>
<b>that you aren't a sexual deviant</b>

43:01.334 --> 43:04.501
<b>who did the unthinkable</b>
<b>with his special penis?</b>

43:12.834 --> 43:14.834
<b>- Deviant...</b>
<b>- Okay, look.</b>

43:14.918 --> 43:17.334
<b>No, in some cultures,</b>

43:17.417 --> 43:20.042
<b>what you did in your family...</b>
<b>(clears throat)</b>

43:20.125 --> 43:23.751
<b>is considered</b>
<b>a crime punishable by death.</b>

43:23.834 --> 43:25.918
<b>So did you have an obligation to tell me</b>

43:26.000 --> 43:29.125
<b>what kind of man</b>
<b>I was getting intimate with</b>

43:29.209 --> 43:32.042
<b>instead of...</b>
<b>(chuckles)</b>

43:32.125 --> 43:34.209
<b>springing it on me,</b>

43:34.292 --> 43:38.167
<b>like the morning paper over some eggs?</b>

43:38.250 --> 43:40.083
<b>I’m not judging you.</b>
<b>I'm making a point.</b>

43:40.167 --> 43:44.834
<b>Look at me.</b>

43:44.918 --> 43:48.709
<b>Okay, I am not judging you.</b>

43:48.792 --> 43:54.292
<b>I mean, you did do something wrong,</b>
<b>but I am not judging you.</b>

43:54.375 --> 43:55.959
<b>I would not do that.</b>

43:56.042 --> 43:59.209
<b>I am not looking down on you.</b>

43:59.292 --> 44:05.918
<b>But you are judging people just</b>
<b>for being themselves.</b>

44:06.000 --> 44:07.918
<b>So let me put your mind at rest</b>
<b>about one thing.</b>

44:08.000 --> 44:13.375
<b>You had sex with a woman last night.</b>

44:13.459 --> 44:15.083
<b>- Yeah, I did.</b>

44:15.167 --> 44:20.918
<b>- You did.</b>
<b>- Mm-hmm.</b>

44:21.000 --> 44:23.209
<b>(clears throat)</b>
<b>And always was--</b>

44:23.292 --> 44:25.918
<b>And always was a woman?</b>

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
<b>(chuckles)</b>
<b>Shit.</b>

44:34.918 --> 44:40.667
<b>Whew.</b>
<b>(Rhonda chuckles)</b>

44:40.751 --> 44:44.292
<b>Can I just say one thing?</b>
<b>- Yeah.</b>

44:44.375 --> 44:48.000
<b>- I-- I believe in equal rights</b>
<b>for everybody.</b>

44:48.083 --> 44:52.501
<b>That's what I believe in.</b>
<b>I mean, for everybody.</b>

44:52.584 --> 44:53.709
<b>- I know you think you do.</b>

44:53.792 --> 44:55.334
<b>- No, I do.</b>

44:55.417 --> 44:57.918
<b>I really do.</b>
<b>- There-- there--</b>

44:58.000 --> 45:00.751
<b>- I do.</b>
<b>- There-- Everyone is feeling real good</b>

45:00.834 --> 45:03.375
<b>about accepting the transgender</b>
<b>right now.</b>

45:03.459 --> 45:04.918
<b>- I know.</b>

45:05.000 --> 45:07.459
<b>- They love the transgender</b>
<b>when they're transitioning.</b>

45:07.542 --> 45:08.918
<b>They're brave.</b>

45:09.000 --> 45:10.709
<b>They're becoming themselves, it's--</b>
<b>- Right.</b>

45:10.792 --> 45:12.667
<b>- Good for them.</b>

45:12.751 --> 45:19.167
<b>But the true path to acceptance comes</b>
<b>when you have sex with one</b>

45:19.250 --> 45:22.417
<b>and you don't think you got cheated</b>
<b>into doing something gay,</b>

45:22.501 --> 45:27.584
<b>'cause that, my sister-fucking friend,</b>

45:27.667 --> 45:29.209
<b>is ignorant.</b>

45:29.292 --> 45:30.959
<b>- Hmm.</b>

45:31.042 --> 45:33.709
<b>- And hey, the fucking was good, right?</b>

45:33.792 --> 45:36.083
<b>You got fucked good by a woman.</b>

45:36.167 --> 45:38.083
<b>- Uh-huh, right.</b>

45:38.167 --> 45:39.751
<b>Yep.</b>

45:39.834 --> 45:42.250
<b>- What difference does it make</b>
<b>what she used to be?</b>

45:42.334 --> 45:44.626
<b>- Hmmm...</b>

45:44.709 --> 45:46.375
<b>(laughing)</b>

45:46.459 --> 45:49.876
<b>Wow.</b>

45:49.959 --> 45:53.209
<b>- And that's why</b>
<b>you shouldn't have breakfast.</b>

45:53.292 --> 45:56.542
<b>- Uh-huh.</b>

45:56.626 --> 45:58.167
<b>(laughing)</b>

46:05.209 --> 46:08.209
<b>- I gotta go.</b>

46:08.292 --> 46:10.125
<b>- You don't have to.</b>
<b>(clears throat)</b>

46:10.209 --> 46:12.209
<b>You don't have to go.</b>

46:12.292 --> 46:19.334
<b>- Yeah, I gotta go.</b>

46:19.417 --> 46:24.167
<b>- Hey, uh...</b>
<b>(clears throat)</b>

46:24.250 --> 46:26.876
<b>Do you want to...</b>

46:26.959 --> 46:31.250
<b>Do you want to see each other again?</b>

46:31.334 --> 46:33.709
<b>- You want to?</b>

46:33.792 --> 46:39.125
<b>- Yeah.</b>

46:39.209 --> 46:41.083
<b>- Okay, there's one thing about me</b>
<b>you should know.</b>

46:41.167 --> 46:44.209
<b>- Uh-huh.</b>

46:44.292 --> 46:45.876
<b>- I'm a drunk.</b>

46:45.959 --> 46:50.751
<b>- Well, I own a bar.</b>

46:50.834 --> 46:53.167
<b>(door opens, then slams)</b>

46:53.250 --> 46:54.417
<b>- We'll see.</b>

46:54.501 --> 46:56.417
<b>- That's my sister.</b>

46:56.501 --> 46:57.584
<b>- Hi.</b>
<b>- Hi.</b>

46:57.667 --> 46:59.542
<b>- Not the...</b>
<b>(door opens)</b>

46:59.626 --> 47:01.375
<b>(door closes)</b>

47:09.792 --> 47:11.667

47:11.751 --> 47:13.709
<b>- Yeah.</b>

47:13.792 --> 47:16.334
<b>How you doing?</b>
<b>- Good.</b>

47:16.417 --> 47:19.918
<b>- What's going on with you?</b>

47:20.000 --> 47:27.167
<b>- Well, I-- I got the results yesterday</b>
<b>and I'm fine.</b>

47:27.250 --> 47:29.834
<b>- You're what?</b>
<b>You're fine?</b>

47:29.918 --> 47:32.542
<b>- Yeah, I'm gonna be fine.</b>

47:32.626 --> 47:37.250
<b>- You serious?</b>

47:54.375 --> 47:58.751
<b>- Uh, not just yet.</b>

47:58.834 --> 48:01.000
<b>I have to plan a life now.</b>

48:01.083 --> 48:02.417
