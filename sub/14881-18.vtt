06:27.787 --> 06:29.822
I don't like the sprinklers.

06:30.523 --> 06:32.458
I want them off.

09:20.693 --> 09:22.728
Bruce, can we get a quick question?

09:24.130 --> 09:26.132
How does it feel to be back
at the track and field trials?

20:33.899 --> 20:35.234
Is this Moses?

20:35.300 --> 20:37.769
-Yeah, this is Moses.
-What's up, Moses?

21:39.698 --> 21:40.966
Yeah, I think I'm pretty content.

21:42.934 --> 21:44.269
Like, just in every way.

21:46.571 --> 21:50.275
Letting that s*** not get in your way,
and having to learn to go through stuff

21:50.342 --> 21:52.377
-and learn how to sacrifice.
-Right.

22:08.060 --> 22:09.027
You know, it's scary,

22:09.094 --> 22:12.864
but it's also just me being responsible
with, like, my heart and everything.

39:58.262 --> 40:00.531
-Hi, Kenny.
-Hi, Mase.

40:05.202 --> 40:06.937
I want to lay with you.

40:34.398 --> 40:36.033
I want to touch hands.
