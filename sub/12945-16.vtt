a better handle on the situation

10:36.600 --> 10:39.367

I think you should talk to her.

-What?

to the mall tomorrow.

10:47.900 --> 10:49.500
Well... That-that's great

10:49.567 --> 10:52.667
because I-I think she needs to know
that we're her friends

10:52.734 --> 10:55.333
and if she ever,
ever needs anyone to talk to,

10:55.400 --> 10:57.000
that we're her go-to peeps.

10:57.066 --> 10:59.600
Through thick, through thin,
we'll always be there,

11:00.200 --> 11:01.200

11:01.266 --> 11:03.533
the whole idea of you talking to her
is a huge relief.

11:03.600 --> 11:05.900

I'd have no idea what to say.

new clothes for the video, right?

11:39.934 --> 11:42.767

to wear them on.

You look great.

11:46.567 --> 11:48.467

11:51.867 --> 11:52.867
No, thanks.

11:53.700 --> 11:56.433
I-I'm just wondering what Miranda sees
when she looks in the mirror

11:56.500 --> 11:58.967

what I see when I look at her.

go get some smoothies?

Miranda, do you remember
that one time that you were afraid

12:18.433 --> 12:20.834
to tell me that my favorite pair
of tapered stone-washed jeans

12:20.900 --> 12:22.033
were out of style?

12:22.100 --> 12:25.066
I never said that
because they were never in style.

12:25.500 --> 12:27.800
Which is exactly what you
should have said when I bought them.

12:28.400 --> 12:30.133

taken it all personal

12:30.233 --> 12:31.233

12:31.300 --> 12:33.533
Actually, I probably
would have thanked you.

12:33.734 --> 12:36.734
You would have spared me the weeks
I spent on the fashion "don't" list.

12:37.467 --> 12:39.433

12:39.900 --> 12:42.133
Well, there's something
I want to talk to you about.

12:42.400 --> 12:44.333

you'll take it the wrong way.
