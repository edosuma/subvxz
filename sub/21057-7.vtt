00:36.640 --> 00:42.149
(The Lady in Dignity)

00:42.380 --> 00:44.950
As you can see, somebody made the canopy collapse.

00:45.049 --> 00:48.920
It was the man from the video sent by A Jin.

00:48.990 --> 00:50.659
What does that have to do with my marriage?

00:50.759 --> 00:51.820
Why does it not?

00:52.090 --> 00:53.630
She is one of the suspects.

00:53.689 --> 00:56.899
If you get caught, tell them...

00:57.030 --> 00:58.659
that Ms. Park told you to do it.

00:58.729 --> 00:59.799
She told me...

01:01.030 --> 01:03.439
to take this secret to the grave.

01:03.640 --> 01:05.670
You know that Ji Hu won a prize in the drawing competition.

01:05.900 --> 01:06.939
Thank you so much.

01:06.939 --> 01:08.769
I have only one woman in my world and that's you.

01:09.269 --> 01:10.709
Are there two suns in this world?

01:10.780 --> 01:13.609
There's only one sun in this world.

01:13.709 --> 01:16.250
But there are no records on her whatsoever...

01:17.049 --> 01:18.120
from 2009 to 2015.

01:18.180 --> 01:20.420
You're the only one...

01:21.120 --> 01:22.120
that I can trust.

01:22.189 --> 01:23.459
I hope we can...

01:23.859 --> 01:26.659
see each other more often.

01:26.930 --> 01:29.359
He has also been exercising early in the morning every day.

01:29.459 --> 01:31.400
He hasn't been cycling every morning.

01:31.530 --> 01:34.200
Your husband is suspicious.

01:34.299 --> 01:35.329
I'll look into it.

01:35.930 --> 01:38.099
I don't want to hear it from someone else.

03:28.479 --> 03:29.509
Hi, Mom.

03:32.020 --> 03:33.050
I just got home.

03:34.449 --> 03:36.490
I stopped by because I was craving those wraps you make.

03:36.490 --> 03:37.689
Nothing is wrong.

03:40.960 --> 03:42.129
Everything is fine.

03:42.590 --> 03:43.629
Yes.

03:43.930 --> 03:44.960
All right.

03:46.629 --> 03:48.870
Have a good time with your friends.

03:49.770 --> 03:50.770
All right.

03:50.800 --> 03:51.969
Talk to you soon.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.039
Okay.

04:00.680 --> 04:03.750
Where did you go so early in the morning? Mr. Ahn went to work.

04:04.180 --> 04:05.849
Ji Hu had breakfast and went to school too.

04:06.580 --> 04:07.650
Thank you.

04:08.090 --> 04:10.090
Did something happen?

04:10.960 --> 04:12.020
No.

04:20.029 --> 04:22.029
Jin Hee, where are you now?

04:23.699 --> 04:24.740
Stay there.

04:25.040 --> 04:26.069
I'll meet you there.

04:29.670 --> 04:31.339
Have you looked into what's going on?

04:32.980 --> 04:34.379
Tell me.

04:35.910 --> 04:38.750
I want to know what you saw and what you know.

04:39.220 --> 04:40.290
Tell me everything.

04:41.720 --> 04:42.720
Well...

04:43.790 --> 04:45.189
How did you know that Ji Hu's dad...

04:46.990 --> 04:48.029
I mean,

04:50.759 --> 04:51.930
my husband.

04:54.829 --> 04:55.930
How did you know...

04:57.939 --> 04:59.600
that he has been seeing another woman?

05:00.569 --> 05:01.610
That's...

05:03.040 --> 05:07.209
I saw him with Ji Hu's art teacher.

05:07.509 --> 05:09.750
Tell me exactly what you saw.

05:13.949 --> 05:15.250
To tell you the truth,

05:15.790 --> 05:17.220
there have been many times...

05:17.220 --> 05:19.220
when he offered to pick Ji Hu up from her art lesson.

05:20.430 --> 05:22.089
But I didn't suspect anything back then.

05:22.259 --> 05:25.000
That day, I guess he had called me...

05:25.329 --> 05:27.430
to tell me that he'd be picking Ji Hu up,

05:27.930 --> 05:29.930
but I happened to miss his call.

05:30.699 --> 05:32.540
When I got there to pick her up,

05:32.740 --> 05:34.310
I saw her teacher and your husband...

05:36.339 --> 05:37.740
They were...

05:38.139 --> 05:39.180
Well...

05:40.350 --> 05:41.750
What I'm trying to say is...

05:43.350 --> 05:45.720
they were touching each other...

05:45.980 --> 05:48.319
in a way that only couples would.

05:51.220 --> 05:54.930
A Jin, I could have gotten the wrong idea. You should check to make sure.

05:55.029 --> 05:57.100
You know that Jae Seok befriends people easily.

05:57.600 --> 05:58.800
And he's not guarded.

05:58.899 --> 06:01.069
How exactly were they touching each other?

06:02.069 --> 06:03.069
What I'm saying is...

06:03.740 --> 06:06.910
He was caressing her face with his hand...

06:11.680 --> 06:12.740
A Jin.

06:13.680 --> 06:15.509
You don't even need to check.

06:16.720 --> 06:18.920
He's having an affair with that woman.

06:28.930 --> 06:30.930
If Father marries that woman,

06:31.699 --> 06:33.029
I'll move out of this house.

06:33.600 --> 06:36.430
So what? Do you think anyone will even care?

06:37.540 --> 06:39.000
You're not saying you'll leave Un Gyu here...

06:39.000 --> 06:40.439
and move out alone, are you?

06:40.540 --> 06:42.240
- Jae Hui. - Un Gyu...

06:42.509 --> 06:45.009
is Dad's eldest grandchild. Dad will probably let you move out,

06:45.339 --> 06:47.180
but he won't let you take him.

06:48.709 --> 06:50.720
That's why I've been putting up with everything.

06:51.649 --> 06:55.319
We need to fight together. If we don't, Park Bok Ja will win.

06:55.319 --> 06:57.019
We definitely shouldn't underestimate her.

06:57.360 --> 07:00.060
Fighting amongst ourselves can wait until after we beat her.

07:00.089 --> 07:01.629
I want to kill her.

07:04.600 --> 07:05.629
I really do.

07:06.870 --> 07:08.329
I want to kill her.

07:10.439 --> 07:12.939
Tell Jae Gu to come back.

07:13.509 --> 07:16.680
He's the only one who can trample her.

07:17.579 --> 07:19.740
He has no power.

07:20.850 --> 07:23.180
Father has no respect for him whatsoever.

07:23.250 --> 07:25.449
But still, he should know too.

07:26.019 --> 07:28.050
- He won't come back. - He said he will.

07:30.759 --> 07:31.759
I already called him.

07:35.829 --> 07:37.500
Right here. I'll get off here.

07:41.529 --> 07:42.699
Thank you.

07:58.220 --> 08:01.050
She scratched my daughter's face and it will leave a scar.

08:01.220 --> 08:03.389
She even stole this doll.

08:03.720 --> 08:04.889
I'm sorry, madam.

08:05.620 --> 08:07.629
Why on earth did you adopt that girl?

08:07.629 --> 08:09.329
Send her back to the orphanage!

09:32.980 --> 09:34.980
I forgot how to walk down the aisle.

09:35.950 --> 09:37.620
When will Ms. Park be back?

09:37.820 --> 09:40.350
She'll be back soon. The wedding doesn't need to be grand.

09:40.490 --> 09:41.750
Let's not tell many people either.

09:41.889 --> 09:43.250
We'll keep it simple then.

09:43.860 --> 09:45.419
Shall I invite the employees?

09:45.860 --> 09:46.889
Don't tell them.

09:47.490 --> 09:51.659
I'll plan the wedding for you, but please try to understand...

09:52.000 --> 09:54.029
how the rest of the family must be feeling now.

09:56.600 --> 09:57.600
We're in a position...

09:57.899 --> 09:59.039
where we have to accept your caregiver...

09:59.039 --> 10:00.570
as a member of our family overnight.

10:00.970 --> 10:03.309
Please give us some time to adjust, Father.

10:04.639 --> 10:05.809
Yes, of course.

10:06.480 --> 10:09.649
She's still young, so it'll be hard for you guys...

10:09.649 --> 10:11.350
to call her Grandmother or Mother.

10:12.019 --> 10:14.049
Even she'll be uncomfortable with that.

10:15.490 --> 10:16.519
A Jin.

10:17.360 --> 10:19.389
I trust you with everything.

10:20.590 --> 10:22.960
Who else can I trust in this family?

10:25.299 --> 10:27.970
Let's accept the fact that Father is getting married.

10:29.429 --> 10:32.470
He said that he'll go ahead and marry her even if we're against it.

10:32.570 --> 10:34.740
If he does that, things will get out of hand.

10:34.870 --> 10:37.909
He won't consult with us on anything from now on.

10:38.110 --> 10:39.110
You do have a point.

10:39.179 --> 10:42.110
Let's cooperate and help him out this time.

10:42.610 --> 10:43.820
Gosh, this is driving me nuts.

10:47.250 --> 10:49.720
A Jin, will you be able to call her Mother?

10:50.059 --> 10:51.389
Let's worry about that later, Ju Mi.

10:51.820 --> 10:54.690
We must stop her from getting him wrapped around her finger.

10:55.159 --> 10:58.299
I'd slap her if Dad wasn't around.

10:58.399 --> 11:00.230
I know what the two of you are worried about.

11:01.129 --> 11:02.529
I have an idea.

11:31.429 --> 11:33.100
What a pretty color.

11:33.769 --> 11:34.899
It's red beet tea.

11:35.899 --> 11:38.639
A close friend of mine makes handmade tea.

11:38.870 --> 11:41.710
He repeats roasting and cooling down semi-dried beet slices...

11:41.870 --> 11:45.039
nine times to make this tea.

11:45.779 --> 11:48.450
This tea will lift up your spirits.

11:57.419 --> 11:59.419
Hey, partner. Something is going on, right?

12:01.590 --> 12:02.629
No.

12:03.830 --> 12:04.860
I think something is going on.

12:05.960 --> 12:07.970
I can tell that you're trying to act like nothing's wrong.

12:10.500 --> 12:12.200
If it's not something that I can help you with,

12:12.200 --> 12:13.509
it'd be a mannerless thing...

12:13.769 --> 12:14.940
to ask you what it is,

12:15.940 --> 12:18.440
but I still want to know what you're going through.

12:20.179 --> 12:22.350
Before that, shouldn't you be asking...

12:22.350 --> 12:24.320
why I came here to see you?

12:24.320 --> 12:25.480
You already told me over the phone.

12:25.980 --> 12:29.019
You said that your father-in-law has decided to marry his caregiver.

12:30.720 --> 12:31.759
Did I tell you?

12:31.759 --> 12:32.789
That's not...

12:33.090 --> 12:36.429
why you're so downcast today, is it?

12:36.799 --> 12:37.799
"Partner."

12:38.929 --> 12:40.629
It's such a nice word.

12:41.470 --> 12:42.500
"Partner."

12:44.240 --> 12:47.909
If my partner does something bad,

12:50.039 --> 12:51.480
whom should I tell?

12:56.110 --> 12:57.649
It's about my father-in-law.

12:58.649 --> 12:59.879
I need your advice on something.

13:07.429 --> 13:09.090
I can't come home today.

13:09.690 --> 13:11.860
You know Dr. Cha, right? The one who opened a clinic in Busan.

13:12.230 --> 13:14.100
His mother-in-law passed away.

13:14.899 --> 13:16.570
I have to attend her funeral in Busan today.

13:23.409 --> 13:26.909
Your husband is seeing another woman.

13:51.039 --> 13:52.169
When did you get back?

13:52.500 --> 13:54.840
Why didn't you call? Mr. Kim could have picked you up.

13:59.340 --> 14:03.450
I stopped by a bakery in my hometown.

14:03.919 --> 14:06.279
I get serious cravings for their rice wine pound cake...

14:06.279 --> 14:07.750
from time to time.

14:08.919 --> 14:11.120
You should try it. Here.

14:16.389 --> 14:17.529
It's good.

14:23.500 --> 14:24.500
Sir.

14:26.200 --> 14:27.570
Living a happy life...

14:28.370 --> 14:30.379
with the person I love...

14:31.039 --> 14:34.080
has always been my wish.

14:35.679 --> 14:37.019
The person you love?

14:38.850 --> 14:40.220
I feel insecure though.

14:41.190 --> 14:42.350
What about?

14:44.190 --> 14:45.519
I'm just not sure...

14:46.620 --> 14:50.460
if I deserve to be this happy.

14:53.799 --> 14:55.970
A Jin was looking for you earlier.

14:56.200 --> 14:58.240
I think she wants to buy you things for the wedding.

14:59.899 --> 15:01.909
She doesn't need to buy me anything.

15:03.980 --> 15:05.639
Just do as she says.

15:12.679 --> 15:15.720
What on earth do they do in the room?

15:15.720 --> 15:16.759
I know, right?

15:21.230 --> 15:24.059
I will be home late today. Finish your homework and go to bed.

15:24.059 --> 15:26.230
Don't forget to take your vitamins, okay?

15:27.000 --> 15:28.669
I love you, my princess.

15:31.870 --> 15:35.039
I'm sorry to take up your time like this since I know how busy you are.

15:35.139 --> 15:37.980
- It's okay. - But please do me another favor.

15:38.779 --> 15:40.809
Could you be my drinking buddy today?

15:42.879 --> 15:44.879
Why not?

15:45.580 --> 15:46.620
Let's go.

15:48.450 --> 15:51.259
Here. I'm sorry to keep you waiting, ma'am.

15:51.389 --> 15:54.230
I checked, but the text message wasn't sent from a phone.

15:54.289 --> 15:56.460
It was sent anonymously from a computer,

15:56.860 --> 15:58.559
so it'll be hard to find out who sent it.

15:58.830 --> 15:59.860
Really?

16:01.470 --> 16:04.000
Then what about the call with the blocked caller ID?

16:04.100 --> 16:07.139
We can trace the number. If you can prove that you were harassed,

16:07.240 --> 16:09.110
threatened, or blackmailed in any way,

16:09.269 --> 16:11.840
you can request to have the number traced.

16:12.279 --> 16:13.580
- Is there a service like that? - Yes.

16:13.679 --> 16:17.320
Do you have a recording of the phone call or anything else to prove it?

16:20.220 --> 16:21.250
Here.

16:21.450 --> 16:23.490
I recorded it just in case.

16:23.659 --> 16:27.029
Your husband is seeing another woman.

16:27.159 --> 16:29.629
You can put in the request right away if you have an ID on you.

16:29.789 --> 16:32.059
We can't really track any calls that were received in the past,

16:32.129 --> 16:34.799
but if you get another call from a blocked number...

16:34.899 --> 16:37.240
during the duration of the service which is one month,

16:37.399 --> 16:39.070
the phone number will show up.

16:40.039 --> 16:41.070
Okay.

16:43.110 --> 16:45.509
- I'd like to get the service. - Sure.

17:05.059 --> 17:07.170
All right. Tell me now.

17:09.630 --> 17:10.799
You asked me...

17:10.799 --> 17:12.470
whom you should talk to when your partner does something bad.

17:15.140 --> 17:17.980
You were talking about your husband, weren't you?

17:20.848 --> 17:22.348
Is he stressing you out?

17:24.118 --> 17:25.150
No, of course not.

17:27.490 --> 17:31.490
He's kindhearted, good-looking, and hardworking.

17:34.130 --> 17:37.160
He told me that I am his sun.

17:37.900 --> 17:38.900
He'd never stress me out.

17:40.230 --> 17:42.900
Everyone makes mistakes.

17:43.400 --> 17:45.740
We all do bad things at times.

17:50.509 --> 17:51.539
But...

17:52.440 --> 17:54.779
some people do things knowing that they're bad.

17:55.380 --> 17:56.410
That's when it becomes a problem.

17:57.779 --> 18:00.450
It hurts others too much.

18:01.119 --> 18:02.190
No way.

18:04.990 --> 18:06.019
He would have...

18:07.660 --> 18:10.500
never done it if he had known that it would hurt me.

18:14.269 --> 18:16.430
There must have been a reason.

18:19.799 --> 18:21.309
I'm sure that there is...

18:24.210 --> 18:25.710
a reason that I don't know about.

18:29.910 --> 18:31.079
Do you want to know...

18:32.349 --> 18:33.519
what the reason is?

19:09.619 --> 19:10.960
You drank everything.

19:14.359 --> 19:15.859
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

19:19.630 --> 19:20.630
Gosh.

19:24.140 --> 19:25.470
I know what you want to say.

19:26.599 --> 19:29.440
I'll wash up after a short snooze.

19:59.440 --> 20:00.440
(Try again in 29 seconds.)

20:18.490 --> 20:21.660
Dad. I like this car the most.

20:22.390 --> 20:24.559
- This car suits you best. - Really?

20:37.410 --> 20:38.910
Thanks, Dad.

20:39.480 --> 20:40.710
You'll drive carefully, right?

20:40.809 --> 20:41.980
"Daddy"?

20:43.309 --> 20:45.019
How ridiculous.

20:50.619 --> 20:51.619
Are you getting your job done?

20:51.990 --> 20:53.019
Yes, sir.

20:53.259 --> 20:54.289
Do they see each other often?

20:54.990 --> 20:57.329
No, I think she has only met him once since that time.

20:57.529 --> 20:58.859
I heard that she's there today though.

21:00.130 --> 21:01.170
She is there alone.

21:01.569 --> 21:03.940
She only sees him when you're not at the hotel.

21:11.039 --> 21:13.039
You are too rude to someone...

21:13.180 --> 21:15.180
who works in the service industry.

21:15.809 --> 21:16.819
Pardon?

21:17.579 --> 21:19.579
The way you talk really irks me.

21:21.450 --> 21:22.450
I'll be careful from now on.

21:23.460 --> 21:25.160
How much time do they usually spend together?

21:25.720 --> 21:27.730
Around 3 to 4 hours usually.

21:31.200 --> 21:34.029
Shall I put up a surveillance camera inside the room too?

21:36.900 --> 21:37.940
You little...

21:38.869 --> 21:40.210
Gosh, this prick.

21:41.039 --> 21:44.039
You obnoxious piece of trash!

21:45.009 --> 21:47.710
Listen. Just do what I tell you to do.

21:47.809 --> 21:50.150
If you do anything else, I'll break all of your limbs...

21:50.220 --> 21:52.880
so that you won't be able to move anything besides your eyes.

21:55.519 --> 21:57.019
You better watch your tongue.

21:57.119 --> 21:58.119
What?

21:59.019 --> 22:00.690
Put up a camera inside the room?

22:01.259 --> 22:02.259
You scum.

22:02.730 --> 22:06.430
Are you saying I should watch my wife doing that with another guy?

23:37.660 --> 23:38.690
Gosh.

23:40.029 --> 23:41.029
What a horrible nightmare.

23:42.559 --> 23:43.559
That felt so real.

23:57.680 --> 23:58.839
Where is my raspberry smoothie?

24:04.720 --> 24:05.750
Are you going to exercise?

24:06.279 --> 24:07.319
Yes.

24:07.349 --> 24:08.390
Have fun.

24:22.329 --> 24:23.700
You pulled a tendon.

24:23.799 --> 24:25.470
You'll need a cast.

24:27.009 --> 24:30.009
Oh. no. You won't be able to exercise for a little while.

24:30.380 --> 24:32.210
I need to exercise though.

24:40.789 --> 24:43.460
Indie pink is the most popular color...

24:43.920 --> 24:45.920
for hanbok amongst brides these days.

24:50.559 --> 24:52.730
The color looks good on you. Do you like it?

24:54.599 --> 24:58.769
Don't brides usually wear a green jacket and a red skirt?

24:59.339 --> 25:02.009
Who wears green and red these days?

25:02.140 --> 25:03.680
No one follows that tradition anymore.

25:03.680 --> 25:05.180
Most brides go for pastel colors.

25:06.750 --> 25:08.779
Red will look good on you as well,

25:08.779 --> 25:10.779
but I think this color looks more elegant.

25:11.450 --> 25:12.480
Elegant?

25:13.589 --> 25:16.349
Let's go with this color then.

25:16.420 --> 25:18.119
Ivory will be a good color for the jacket.

25:18.920 --> 25:20.089
Okay.

25:21.329 --> 25:23.029
You must know my father-in-law's size.

25:23.289 --> 25:25.460
Yes, I do. You'll need a blanket too, right?

25:25.630 --> 25:27.299
Yes, we'll order one.

25:27.329 --> 25:29.700
It'll be great if the hanbok can be made as soon as possible.

25:29.970 --> 25:33.299
You already told me. We'll get started right away.

25:35.069 --> 25:37.240
The doctor said that I pulled a tendon.

25:38.509 --> 25:40.009
I can't come by for the next little while.

25:40.710 --> 25:42.210
I can't ride a bike.

25:42.210 --> 25:43.920
What excuse will I give to sneak out in the morning?

25:47.819 --> 25:50.490
Yes. Let's talk again later.

25:51.019 --> 25:53.529
All right. I can call you later or you can call me if you'd like.

25:55.529 --> 25:57.730
Will you make an announcement about the chairman's wedding?

25:57.900 --> 26:00.769
Gosh, it's nothing to brag about. There will be no announcement.

26:00.900 --> 26:03.900
You're saying that you won't make it official, right?

26:04.970 --> 26:06.470
All the board members know, don't they?

26:06.470 --> 26:08.640
- Yes. - Gosh, I'm so embarrassed.

26:09.009 --> 26:11.039
How can he be crazy about a woman...

26:11.039 --> 26:13.710
when the company isn't doing so well?

26:18.220 --> 26:20.390
I hurt my foot.

26:22.789 --> 26:24.960
Aunt Jin Hee, you look sad today.

26:27.230 --> 26:28.390
Do I?

26:28.559 --> 26:29.589
I guess I can't hide it.

26:30.029 --> 26:31.400
Don't be sad.

26:31.559 --> 26:34.900
Sadness only grows if you dwell on it.

26:37.140 --> 26:38.839
What should I do to make myself feel better?

26:41.269 --> 26:43.779
Try to think about someone who must be feeling worse than you.

26:43.839 --> 26:45.539
That will make you feel a bit better.

26:46.480 --> 26:48.150
Someone who must be feeling worse than me?

26:56.690 --> 26:57.859
Ji Hu.

26:58.160 --> 26:59.660
Be good to your mom, okay?

27:00.559 --> 27:02.059
I really like your mom.

27:02.430 --> 27:03.460
Me too.

27:03.529 --> 27:07.029
My mom has a heart of gold.

27:07.329 --> 27:11.339
But people don't see it because she's too pretty.

27:11.700 --> 27:15.369
That's right. That's why I like her so much.

27:17.710 --> 27:19.539
Do you see anything you like?

27:19.809 --> 27:21.809
We don't really need to buy any furniture, do we?

27:22.049 --> 27:23.549
You're getting married.

27:23.549 --> 27:25.220
We should buy a new bed and wardrobe for you and Father.

27:27.289 --> 27:29.619
You got everything you wanted to do in your hometown done, right?

27:30.660 --> 27:31.819
Almost.

27:32.490 --> 27:34.490
How many family members will you be inviting?

27:35.160 --> 27:37.200
No one actually.

27:37.900 --> 27:38.900
Don't you have anyone to invite?

27:39.730 --> 27:42.769
Both of my parents passed away,

27:43.500 --> 27:45.839
and I don't speak to any of my relatives.

27:46.400 --> 27:47.440
I see.

27:47.769 --> 27:50.279
Then, we'll only invite a few close relatives and friends.

27:52.480 --> 27:55.809
This wardrobe is very nice, don't you think?

27:56.349 --> 27:58.349
- Do you like it? - Yes.

27:59.450 --> 28:00.450
Excuse me.

28:02.250 --> 28:06.289
How should we address each other after the wedding?

28:07.359 --> 28:08.390
Good question.

28:08.730 --> 28:11.430
Wouldn't you feel awkward to be called a mother-in-law overnight?

28:11.730 --> 28:15.730
I can call you my daughter-in-law.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.839
I'll try too.

28:19.339 --> 28:21.670
There have been ups and downs, but it's all in the past.

28:21.869 --> 28:22.910
Let's be on good terms.

28:23.539 --> 28:26.240
Please understand even if I can't call you Mother right away.

28:27.210 --> 28:28.380
Of course.

28:29.079 --> 28:31.750
By the way, your parents will be...

28:31.819 --> 28:33.990
attending the wedding, right?

28:34.119 --> 28:36.289
Yes, my mom will be coming.

28:36.289 --> 28:38.119
Not my dad though. He's passed away.

28:38.460 --> 28:41.490
- Gosh. When? - When I was eight.

28:43.329 --> 28:44.500
I don't have any siblings either.

28:44.630 --> 28:46.299
That's why I get lonely easily.

28:46.829 --> 28:48.829
- I feel the same. - Really?

28:49.529 --> 28:52.539
I get so sad when I'm sick.

28:52.769 --> 28:56.140
You probably don't know what it feels like to have no family at all.

28:57.710 --> 28:59.680
I guess not. My mom has always been there for me.

29:00.049 --> 29:01.549
My mom is my whole universe.

29:01.609 --> 29:03.950
I want to be a mom too.

29:06.789 --> 29:09.450
I want to be a good mom.

29:13.220 --> 29:15.930
Well, that's something the two of you should decide,

29:16.660 --> 29:18.160
- but at Father's age... - Gosh.

29:18.200 --> 29:20.700
What's wrong with his age?

29:21.029 --> 29:23.069
Confucius' father had Confucius...

29:23.369 --> 29:26.369
with a 20-year-old woman...

29:26.400 --> 29:28.109
when he was 80.

29:29.339 --> 29:31.839
I heard that children born to older parents...

29:31.839 --> 29:34.180
tend to be incredibly smart.

29:47.130 --> 29:48.160
Are you leaving?

29:48.490 --> 29:49.660
Have you had dinner yet?

29:49.829 --> 29:51.000
I don't have much appetite.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.470
I made braised kimchi. Don't you like it?

29:53.670 --> 29:55.670
Yes, I do. Thank you.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.839
You must be worried about a lot of things.

29:58.269 --> 30:01.109
You have to eat well and stay strong at times like this.

30:02.009 --> 30:05.339
Okay, I'll eat. Good job for today. You should get going.

30:17.920 --> 30:20.430
(Partner)

30:20.430 --> 30:21.589
Can you call me?

30:31.769 --> 30:33.809
Do you feel better today?

30:35.339 --> 30:36.369
Yes.

30:36.509 --> 30:38.339
Thank you so much for everything yesterday.

30:38.410 --> 30:40.250
You were a great drinking buddy.

30:40.579 --> 30:41.609
Don't mention it.

30:42.049 --> 30:43.079
It's the least I can do.

30:43.450 --> 30:45.450
I have all the paperwork ready.

30:45.750 --> 30:49.589
I must be present when they sign it, then we have to get it notarized.

30:50.589 --> 30:53.089
I'm sorry, but would you be able to come by?

30:53.160 --> 30:54.990
He can't really leave the house at the moment.

30:54.990 --> 30:56.700
Sure. When would be good?

30:57.000 --> 31:00.670
Will you be able to stop by around 8am tomorrow morning?

31:01.670 --> 31:03.000
That early?

31:03.029 --> 31:04.069
Yes.

31:05.500 --> 31:06.539
All right, I will.

31:07.470 --> 31:09.470
Thank you. I'll see you tomorrow then.

31:09.640 --> 31:11.309
Okay, see you tomorrow.

31:11.440 --> 31:12.440
You hang up first.

31:18.880 --> 31:19.880
Cheer up.

31:21.390 --> 31:22.420
This shall pass too.

31:26.019 --> 31:27.089
Thank you.

31:29.990 --> 31:32.000
- You hang up first. - Okay.

31:32.430 --> 31:33.599
I'll hang up then.

32:24.720 --> 32:26.549
Mom, I'm home.

32:30.220 --> 32:33.390
My princess. It must have been a long day for you.

32:33.390 --> 32:35.390
I'll make fried rice with an omelet on top, which you love.

32:35.390 --> 32:36.900
I can make the sauce quickly.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
It's okay. I'll just have what you're eating.

32:39.660 --> 32:40.730
Will you?

32:41.099 --> 32:42.799
It's so delicious.

32:43.470 --> 32:45.500
You must be hungry too. Eat with us.

32:47.410 --> 32:49.240
It smells amazing.

32:56.849 --> 32:59.180
Pick up Mom's favorite macarons on your way home.

33:00.849 --> 33:03.019
I hurt my foot. Macarons, my foot.

33:07.190 --> 33:10.359
You have your art lesson tomorrow, right?

33:12.529 --> 33:15.700
What do you think about not taking those lessons anymore?

33:19.240 --> 33:22.240
I didn't expect you to agree so easily.

33:23.240 --> 33:24.910
You liked taking the art lessons.

33:25.109 --> 33:28.950
I'm sure you're suggesting it because you have a good reason.

33:35.019 --> 33:36.519
I'm sorry.

33:37.359 --> 33:39.390
Why are you sorry?

33:45.359 --> 33:46.730
(Dad)

33:46.829 --> 33:49.529
I hurt my foot, so I can't really go anywhere.

33:51.400 --> 33:53.410
Mom, Dad says that he hurt his foot.

33:53.970 --> 33:54.970
I know.

33:56.009 --> 33:57.039
Mom.

33:58.109 --> 33:59.140
Yes?

33:59.140 --> 34:01.150
Let's try to love Dad too.

34:01.680 --> 34:04.680
I don't think he feels loved enough by us.

34:09.119 --> 34:11.619
Mom, I'm so happy that you're my mom.

34:13.960 --> 34:15.130
I know, right?

34:16.530 --> 34:17.860
Aren't I the best?

34:20.929 --> 34:21.929
Ji Hu!

34:22.730 --> 34:23.739
Dad.

34:28.539 --> 34:29.909
- Give me a kiss. - Ji Hu.

34:30.280 --> 34:33.110
Go to your room. Mom and Dad have to talk about something.

34:33.309 --> 34:35.309
- Okay. - Sweet dreams.

34:37.280 --> 34:38.780
Are you upset about something?

34:39.179 --> 34:40.219
No.

34:40.289 --> 34:42.449
I'm so excited that I want to dance around the house.

34:43.719 --> 34:46.789
Don't lie to my face. You look so grumpy right now.

34:47.159 --> 34:48.190
I told you.

34:48.690 --> 34:50.199
About Dad getting married,

34:50.260 --> 34:51.599
just give up and come to tears...

34:51.599 --> 34:52.929
Make sure you're free for lunch tomorrow.

34:53.030 --> 34:54.699
Let's have lunch together.

34:55.630 --> 34:56.630
Sure, let's do that.

35:02.469 --> 35:03.639
Wait up.

35:11.280 --> 35:13.590
- Hello? - Ms. Yun, Ji Hu can no longer...

35:13.590 --> 35:14.949
take art lessons from you.

35:15.050 --> 35:16.420
My goodness. Why?

35:16.789 --> 35:20.329
I'd like to talk to you about it in person around lunchtime tomorrow.

35:21.230 --> 35:22.389
Let's have lunch together.

35:22.760 --> 35:23.760
Sure, no problem.

35:31.699 --> 35:34.039
I can't even take a shower with my foot like this.

35:36.739 --> 35:38.409
You must be so sad about...

35:38.409 --> 35:40.579
not being able to ride your bike because of your foot.

35:40.579 --> 35:41.750
Of course.

35:41.750 --> 35:43.619
This is totally ruining the momentum.

35:46.949 --> 35:49.119
Jae Hui told me that she called Jae Gu. Did you hear?

35:49.449 --> 35:51.119
Yes, I heard.

35:51.190 --> 35:53.690
It will be a total disaster.

35:54.659 --> 35:55.829
I know, right?

35:56.760 --> 35:57.800
Go to sleep.

35:57.800 --> 35:59.460
I need to pack Ji Hu's school supplies.

36:05.469 --> 36:07.510
Seong Hui.

36:07.510 --> 36:09.010
(Mr. Yun)

36:14.679 --> 36:17.380
Don't be too sad even if I can't see you tomorrow morning.

36:17.949 --> 36:19.280
Let's find another way.

36:22.789 --> 36:23.820
Okay.

36:23.889 --> 36:26.059
Let's meet at night from now on.

36:33.199 --> 36:34.369
You've awaken?

36:37.670 --> 36:39.670
- What's wrong? - Who...

36:42.469 --> 36:43.510
Who did it?

36:44.010 --> 36:45.840
Why are you asking me?

36:45.880 --> 36:47.250
Shouldn't you know the answer to that?

36:49.809 --> 36:51.820
- Whom are you calling? - The detective.

36:52.480 --> 36:55.489
He told me to call him as soon as you wake up.

36:55.920 --> 36:57.260
We have to catch who did this to you.

36:57.360 --> 36:58.860
Don't call him.

36:58.860 --> 37:01.489
- Why? - I can't really talk now.

37:02.389 --> 37:03.400
Call him later.

37:05.630 --> 37:06.800
I'll call the nurse.

37:07.199 --> 37:09.230
Yun Jae's skating competition is tomorrow.

37:09.230 --> 37:11.070
I have to pack what he needs,

37:11.170 --> 37:12.170
so I have to go home now.

37:12.340 --> 37:14.010
Mother will be here starting tomorrow.

37:27.949 --> 37:29.989
This is Attorney Kang Gi Ho.

37:31.789 --> 37:32.789
Hello.

37:33.929 --> 37:35.260
Ju Mi, I asked him to come by early...

37:35.659 --> 37:37.360
so that we can get it done when everyone is here...

37:37.559 --> 37:39.230
before you head out to work.

37:40.230 --> 37:42.900
Jae Seok went into work early today because of a meeting,

37:42.900 --> 37:45.199
so I'll be representing my family.

38:05.889 --> 38:07.260
It's your prenuptial agreement.

38:08.059 --> 38:11.099
I thought that it'd be a good idea to set things in stone.

38:11.630 --> 38:13.300
Father, please read it over.

38:13.969 --> 38:14.969
You too, Ms. Park.

38:22.170 --> 38:23.880
(Prenuptial Agreement)

38:25.039 --> 38:28.380
"The wife, Park Bok Ja, will not claim any rights..."

38:28.380 --> 38:30.050
"over her spouse Ahn Tae Dong's estate..."

38:30.320 --> 38:35.320
"except for what he decides to give to her following their marriage."

38:35.489 --> 38:36.519
That's right.

38:36.519 --> 38:38.190
"Should any unfortunate accident happen,"

38:38.289 --> 38:39.289
"she'll also give up her right of inheritance..."

38:39.289 --> 38:40.789
"as his spouse entirely."

38:41.090 --> 38:43.929
Those are the main terms of the agreement.

38:43.929 --> 38:45.630
It's based on Article 829 of the Civil Act,

38:45.630 --> 38:49.800
Agreement and Its Alteration on Matrimonial Property.

38:49.800 --> 38:53.639
We'll notarize it before your wedding with your consent.

38:56.039 --> 38:57.380
Ms. Park, you told us...

38:58.039 --> 39:01.050
that you only care about protecting Father.

39:01.849 --> 39:03.550
We believe it.

39:17.329 --> 39:19.329
Do I sign here?

39:20.199 --> 39:23.199
Gosh, I have no problem with signing this.

39:32.039 --> 39:34.880
What are you waiting for, sir? You should sign it too.

39:40.420 --> 39:43.090
We still need to take it to the court to get it notarized.

39:43.289 --> 39:46.320
I'll keep a copy of the notarization certificate.

39:46.760 --> 39:49.789
I witnessed the two of you signing the agreement.

39:59.869 --> 40:01.710
Whose name is the reservation under?

40:01.909 --> 40:04.239
It should be under Ms. Woo A Jin.

40:04.980 --> 40:06.480
This way, please.

40:22.429 --> 40:25.099
Hello, where is the room reserved under Woo A Jin?

40:25.460 --> 40:27.630
- This way, please. - Thanks.

40:27.800 --> 40:29.800
- Please be careful. - Why do you keep dragging me...

40:29.869 --> 40:31.570
when I haven't even taken my foot off the floor?

41:22.019 --> 41:23.420
Please give us 30 minutes to decide.

41:23.420 --> 41:24.489
Sure.

41:27.059 --> 41:28.389
Ms. Yun.

41:29.389 --> 41:30.460
Yes.

41:30.460 --> 41:32.829
I heard you've been seeing my husband.

41:35.030 --> 41:36.030
Well, that's...

41:36.030 --> 41:38.039
A Jin, I think you got the wrong idea.

41:38.039 --> 41:39.070
Yes, I have.

41:40.210 --> 41:41.869
What does he do at your place every morning?

41:41.969 --> 41:44.380
- I don't do anything. I just... - We slept together.

41:45.610 --> 41:47.980
I'm sorry. Your husband and I...

41:48.510 --> 41:49.679
love each other.

41:50.719 --> 41:53.420
Hey. Are you trying to give her a heart attack or what?

41:53.519 --> 41:55.219
How can you be so blunt?

41:55.389 --> 41:57.059
Think about how it might make her feel.

41:57.059 --> 41:58.760
The two of us are meant to be together.

41:58.889 --> 41:59.889
Meant to be together?

42:03.130 --> 42:04.500
I'm speechless.

42:04.659 --> 42:07.670
Does that mean you'll keep seeing him?

42:08.599 --> 42:09.599
- Yes. - No.

42:10.269 --> 42:11.599
No, A Jin.

42:12.440 --> 42:13.809
- Ahn Jae Seok. - Yes?

42:13.969 --> 42:15.309
This is your last chance.

42:15.440 --> 42:18.110
Do you want Ji Hu and me to estrange you,

42:18.110 --> 42:19.639
or do you want us to stay as a family?

42:20.110 --> 42:21.610
Make your choice now.

42:22.780 --> 42:24.150
Will you keep seeing her?

42:31.360 --> 42:32.389
No, of course not.

42:32.920 --> 42:35.090
You know that Father's wedding is in two days, right?

42:35.429 --> 42:37.599
- Yes. - I don't want to cause a ruckus,

42:37.599 --> 42:39.630
so the two of you should put an end to this here.

42:39.630 --> 42:40.630
If you don't,

42:42.269 --> 42:43.269
you...

42:44.000 --> 42:46.039
- Yes. - I'll kill you.

42:58.780 --> 43:01.119
I'd like to pay you for the art lessons.

43:03.190 --> 43:04.860
(Personal cheque)

43:13.530 --> 43:16.530
I got this fountain pen as a gift when I was graduating college.

43:16.900 --> 43:19.070
I used to use it all the time,

43:19.070 --> 43:20.739
but it has become useless as it's hard...

43:20.739 --> 43:22.570
to find the ink for it these days.

43:22.570 --> 43:23.579
But...

43:24.280 --> 43:25.639
I still can't throw it out.

43:27.250 --> 43:30.079
I signed Ji Hu's very first report card with this,

43:30.179 --> 43:33.219
and I also signed all of our real estate contracts with it.

43:33.889 --> 43:35.889
To me, that man is just like this pen.

43:36.050 --> 43:39.090
He's used and worthless, but I'd hate to let him go...

43:39.090 --> 43:40.429
because he has my finger marks all over him.

43:41.059 --> 43:42.230
I especially...

43:43.130 --> 43:44.500
won't let it slide...

43:45.130 --> 43:46.969
if someone steals him from me.

43:47.829 --> 43:50.000
Don't try to steal what belongs to someone else.

43:50.199 --> 43:51.199
Buy your own.

43:51.969 --> 43:54.139
Do you get what I'm saying?

43:58.010 --> 44:01.010
Go and ask your parents what they think.

44:01.079 --> 44:03.380
Tell them that you're seeing a married man...

44:03.380 --> 44:04.449
and ask them to be supportive.

44:04.449 --> 44:05.780
- Look. - Shut up.

44:07.219 --> 44:09.889
What can someone like you possibly use to compete against me?

44:10.159 --> 44:12.159
Is it your looks because you're younger than me?

44:12.159 --> 44:13.989
You obviously got a ton of work done on your face.

44:14.860 --> 44:16.230
I only got my eyes done.

44:16.230 --> 44:17.559
Shut your mouth.

44:17.929 --> 44:19.199
You're no better than a piece of garbage.

44:19.199 --> 44:20.230
Garbage?

44:21.170 --> 44:24.199
- You are out of line. - Yes, I'm using harsh words,

44:24.670 --> 44:26.840
but if you see my husband once again,

44:26.840 --> 44:29.340
you'll get a lot more than just harsh words.

44:29.670 --> 44:31.840
I'll make sure that you won't even able to say...

44:32.340 --> 44:35.050
that I'm out of line. Do you get that?

44:35.480 --> 44:37.820
I always do what I say I'll do.

44:38.250 --> 44:39.949
I've always achieved everything...

44:40.949 --> 44:42.320
that I set my mind to.

44:52.030 --> 44:54.070
Take your time and enjoy your last lunch together...

44:54.070 --> 44:55.099
over farewell drinks.

44:55.170 --> 44:56.500
I'm quite busy today.

44:57.699 --> 44:58.869
A Jin...

45:21.860 --> 45:22.860
I'm livid.

45:23.400 --> 45:25.400
I'm fuming mad right now.

45:32.599 --> 45:33.969
Hey, I told you not to behave this way...

45:34.739 --> 45:37.079
I clearly told you not to do things like this.

45:40.380 --> 45:42.880
Aunt Jin Hee, can you take me to Ms. Yun's place?

45:43.679 --> 45:45.719
You're not taking art lessons anymore.

45:45.849 --> 45:46.889
Didn't you hear about it?

45:47.150 --> 45:50.489
I know that, but I left my art supplies and sketchbook there.

45:50.889 --> 45:53.730
Right. I'll pick them up for you.

45:53.789 --> 45:55.789
No, I should say goodbye to her.

45:55.860 --> 45:57.699
You don't need to.

45:57.929 --> 45:59.360
My mom told me...

45:59.500 --> 46:01.230
that being disrespectful to someone...

46:01.230 --> 46:02.730
just because that person isn't perfect...

46:03.030 --> 46:05.670
makes me a worse person.

46:06.840 --> 46:08.670
All right. Go say goodbye to her.

46:09.639 --> 46:12.139
I shall see that woman's face for one last time.

46:19.619 --> 46:22.289
Today will be Ji Hu's last lesson.

46:36.369 --> 46:38.039
- That was quick. - Yes.

46:43.039 --> 46:45.579
I finished the drawing I was working on the other day.

46:45.739 --> 46:47.579
I gave it to Ms. Yun as a gift.

47:09.730 --> 47:10.800
Jae Gu!

47:13.409 --> 47:14.440
How have you been?

47:15.809 --> 47:17.840
I heard that you're getting divorced. Did you already do it?

47:18.510 --> 47:20.010
Not yet. I will though.

47:20.110 --> 47:21.780
Our old man is getting remarried,

47:21.780 --> 47:23.449
and you're getting divorced. What a joke.

47:23.449 --> 47:24.949
Our family is so dysfunctional.

47:24.949 --> 47:27.789
Let's hurry home. Don't you miss Un Gyu?

47:30.420 --> 47:31.460
Ju Mi.

47:38.300 --> 47:39.300
Ju Mi.

47:39.829 --> 47:41.829
You haven't seen him in years. Don't be like that, please.

47:43.440 --> 47:46.440
Un Gyu won't be home until late.

47:47.739 --> 47:48.769
He's a senior now.

47:49.710 --> 47:50.739
You know that, right?

47:53.110 --> 47:54.679
Dad is out with that woman.

48:22.340 --> 48:24.010
Who told that punk to come back?

48:34.119 --> 48:35.190
Get out of my house!

48:35.250 --> 48:36.320
Dad.

48:36.420 --> 48:39.090
Sir, please don't be like this.

48:39.159 --> 48:40.989
After your wedding,

48:41.559 --> 48:43.400
I'll leave with my wife and son,

48:44.000 --> 48:45.659
but I want my share of the company stock...

48:46.659 --> 48:48.329
and your assets.

48:48.429 --> 48:49.429
What?

48:49.800 --> 48:51.969
I already made it clear to you that you won't get anything.

48:51.969 --> 48:54.010
I can sue for my legal share of inheritance!

48:54.739 --> 48:55.769
Don't you know that?

48:56.539 --> 49:00.550
I'll get my share after you pass away anyway.

49:00.610 --> 49:02.780
What did you just say? How dare you...

49:03.380 --> 49:04.550
Mr. Ahn!

49:05.250 --> 49:07.289
That is extremely out of line.

49:07.550 --> 49:09.590
You're aware of Mr. Chairman's health condition.

49:09.650 --> 49:11.659
How can you say such a thing...

49:12.190 --> 49:13.889
after being gone for years?

49:13.989 --> 49:15.730
Who are you to meddle in our family affairs?

49:15.760 --> 49:16.800
Stay out of it!

49:18.130 --> 49:19.460
Why should I stay out of it?

49:22.099 --> 49:23.300
Please watch your mouth.

49:24.440 --> 49:27.769
Your dad and I are getting married tomorrow.

49:28.510 --> 49:31.880
It means that I'll be his wife legally as of tomorrow.

49:32.710 --> 49:34.210
I don't want to act like a mother to you,

49:34.210 --> 49:37.219
but if you're rude to Chairman Ahn...

49:37.219 --> 49:39.250
or do anything that threatens the peace of this family,

49:39.780 --> 49:42.789
I will not tolerate it.

49:44.989 --> 49:48.989
It looks like my dad is marrying one special lady.

49:51.429 --> 49:53.130
Jae Gu, that's enough.

49:53.130 --> 49:56.630
I don't want to see any of you. Get lost! Get out of my sight.

50:39.110 --> 50:41.110
What on earth happened to you?

50:41.579 --> 50:42.750
You look pathetic.

50:45.050 --> 50:47.750
Unexpected injuries can happen when you work hard.

50:47.949 --> 50:49.289
You clumsy idiot.

50:49.650 --> 50:51.719
None of my children makes me proud.

50:52.820 --> 50:54.329
My goodness.

51:01.199 --> 51:04.039
Jae Gu, go get changed. What on earth are you wearing now?

51:04.170 --> 51:05.670
Be quiet, you punk.

51:05.670 --> 51:09.170
Goodness. As they say, people don't change.

51:09.170 --> 51:11.679
Just be thankful that I'm not causing a scene now.

51:12.179 --> 51:13.510
Gosh.

51:21.550 --> 51:24.389
We'd like to thank all of you for joining us today...

51:24.820 --> 51:25.989
for this special occasion.

51:43.039 --> 51:45.039
Where is Jae Gu staying now?

51:45.139 --> 51:47.179
I don't know. I guess he's staying at a hotel.

51:47.510 --> 51:49.849
Tell him to just come and stay at home.

51:50.349 --> 51:52.679
How can I do that? You know how much Father hates him.

51:55.420 --> 51:56.920
I bet you have no idea how I feel.

51:57.719 --> 52:00.730
You can be that laid-back and considerate...

52:00.989 --> 52:03.030
because you have a husband who is there for you.

52:03.130 --> 52:04.159
You should be grateful.

52:04.599 --> 52:05.929
Why do you think I'm in this mess?

52:06.530 --> 52:09.199
Ju Mi, why are you saying such a thing on this happy day?

52:10.239 --> 52:11.900
I'm going to move out.

52:12.369 --> 52:13.739
I really can't take it anymore.

52:16.340 --> 52:17.380
Ju Mi.

52:18.940 --> 52:22.449
About the accident at Father's birthday party...

52:24.579 --> 52:25.920
Never mind. It's nothing.

52:25.949 --> 52:27.949
Finish your sentence.

52:28.289 --> 52:31.619
We shouldn't talk about it today. Let's talk about it another time.

52:43.230 --> 52:45.070
My princess, you must be tired.

52:46.070 --> 52:47.110
Mom.

52:47.309 --> 52:50.309
Do I have to call her Grandma from now on?

52:51.139 --> 52:53.849
Well. I know that it won't be easy,

52:53.849 --> 52:56.010
but it'll be a polite thing to do.

52:56.880 --> 52:58.050
I will do so then.

53:09.159 --> 53:10.159
My gosh.

53:11.400 --> 53:13.059
I made such a difficult decision for them.

53:13.059 --> 53:14.730
They should really be more appreciative.

53:15.070 --> 53:16.739
Gosh, seriously.

53:17.539 --> 53:20.710
Why is every woman so selfish?

53:23.639 --> 53:25.340
I can't believe this.

53:27.050 --> 53:29.210
We'll go to Europe and Bali...

53:29.610 --> 53:33.119
when I'm fully recovered.

53:33.219 --> 53:34.219
Okay?

53:34.820 --> 53:35.989
Of course.

53:36.820 --> 53:39.989
But I don't have to go to those places, sir.

53:41.090 --> 53:43.260
I like your accent.

53:44.300 --> 53:45.300
Then,

53:46.130 --> 53:48.300
I'll just talk with my accent...

53:48.670 --> 53:51.840
when I'm alone with you.

53:52.070 --> 53:53.239
All right.

54:25.340 --> 54:28.010
Today, we'll work on forgiveness.

54:28.670 --> 54:32.340
They say that hatred is the heaviest burden...

54:32.539 --> 54:33.909
on our hearts.

54:34.110 --> 54:36.610
Today, I'd like all of us to take some time...

54:36.650 --> 54:39.650
to try to forgive those whom we feel...

54:39.849 --> 54:42.690
that we absolutely can't forgive.

54:44.019 --> 54:46.190
All right. Please close your eyes.

54:48.360 --> 54:51.360
Now in your mind, call the name of the person...

54:51.960 --> 54:54.130
whom you really don't think that you can forgive.

54:56.400 --> 54:59.739
Then, please take a few moments to imagine that person in pain...

55:00.139 --> 55:01.809
from the hatred and animosity...

55:02.440 --> 55:05.110
radiating from you.

55:09.449 --> 55:13.820
The pain has made that person miserable.

55:15.289 --> 55:18.989
Now, take a good look at your heart...

55:19.920 --> 55:22.260
and see if that has made you happier.

55:23.929 --> 55:26.429
I'm sure that it has made you...

55:27.030 --> 55:28.730
as miserable.

55:32.039 --> 55:33.099
All right.

55:33.639 --> 55:34.710
Now,

55:36.269 --> 55:38.780
give that person a big hug.

55:39.809 --> 55:43.480
Try to imagine that person...

55:44.349 --> 55:46.449
crying in your arms.

55:48.849 --> 55:51.889
There must have been a reason...

55:53.530 --> 55:57.199
why that person did what he or she did.

56:36.630 --> 56:37.800
You're back.

56:51.980 --> 56:52.980
Ms. Jo.

56:55.949 --> 56:57.789
We should deep clean the house tomorrow.

56:58.590 --> 57:01.260
I do it once every two weeks with the cleaning ladies.

57:01.659 --> 57:04.000
We're supposed to do it next week.

57:05.659 --> 57:07.699
Who says you can put it off until next week?

57:10.539 --> 57:12.699
From now on,

57:13.639 --> 57:14.809
I will make all decisions.

57:15.269 --> 57:16.440
Do you understand?

57:17.809 --> 57:18.840
Sure.

57:24.280 --> 57:26.320
Please clean the empty room upstairs, Ms. Jo.

57:26.519 --> 57:28.349
Jae Gu will sleep there.

57:29.750 --> 57:32.119
Ms. Park, what should we do with the room you used to use?

57:32.119 --> 57:33.429
We should hire someone to help...

57:33.429 --> 57:35.960
Ms. Jo now that the family has gotten bigger.

57:36.659 --> 57:39.829
Jae Gu is back too, so I think that's a good idea.

57:40.300 --> 57:43.300
I've already found someone.

57:44.500 --> 57:45.539
Pardon?

57:47.739 --> 57:48.769
That must be her.

57:54.349 --> 57:58.179
Ms. Woo, whose orders should I follow from now on?

58:13.599 --> 58:16.269
She's a new maid who'll be working for us.

58:16.500 --> 58:18.500
Say hello. This is the younger son's wife.

58:19.639 --> 58:20.969
Nice to meet you.

58:21.969 --> 58:23.170
You should have discussed this with me...

58:23.170 --> 58:25.340
before going ahead and hiring someone.

58:25.579 --> 58:28.079
I didn't have time to speak with you about it, A Jin.

58:28.809 --> 58:30.320
Did you bring your resume?

58:33.079 --> 58:36.449
There's no need. She'll work for me,

58:36.590 --> 58:37.760
so I'll figure it out.

58:38.719 --> 58:42.730
I'll take care of everything in this household from now on.

58:44.260 --> 58:45.260
A Jin.

58:46.869 --> 58:48.570
Thanks for doing so much for the family.

58:49.929 --> 58:52.440
Do you know when my mother-in-law's death anniversary is?

58:52.969 --> 58:55.969
We also have a gardener and a helper who comes three times a week.

58:56.010 --> 58:57.510
Do you have their numbers?

58:57.940 --> 59:00.280
Did you say you'll take care of everything in this household?

59:01.050 --> 59:03.719
Are you confident about pulling it off without my help at all?

59:07.219 --> 59:08.250
I'll help you,

59:09.090 --> 59:10.420
so take your time.

59:15.860 --> 59:16.860
Sure.

59:18.400 --> 59:20.230
I will take my time.

59:22.130 --> 59:24.170
All right then. Have a good day.

59:45.489 --> 59:47.559
(The Lady in Dignity)

59:47.860 --> 59:49.730
I'm not Park Cho Hui anymore.

59:49.789 --> 59:51.800
I'm the madam of Daesung Pulp.

59:51.900 --> 59:54.929
I'll become your eyes and ears as you want.

59:55.070 --> 59:57.900
He told me that you paid him to hurt Park Bok Ja.

59:57.969 --> 59:59.000
Who is right then?

59:59.099 --> 01:00:00.909
I would have told him to kill her.

01:00:00.969 --> 01:00:03.940
They really get on my nerves.

01:00:04.010 --> 01:00:06.179
- What should we do, Madam? - Get rid of them one by one.

01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:07.309
I told you to get out.

01:00:07.409 --> 01:00:09.849
I'm going to make your room into a karaoke and movie room.

01:00:09.949 --> 01:00:13.150
Why are you doing this to me? Why just me?

01:00:13.389 --> 01:00:16.489
Imagine if we only had a sun. We wouldn't be able to live with that.

01:00:16.550 --> 01:00:18.719
Seong Hui.

01:00:18.820 --> 01:00:21.860
I'll live with no expectations. This is for Ji Hu.

01:00:22.690 --> 01:00:25.260
If Ms. Park ever needs my help,

01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:27.570
I'm always willing to offer it.

01:00:27.630 --> 01:00:30.239
Our love hasn't ended yet.

01:00:30.570 --> 01:00:31.969
Are we really going to end it here?

01:00:31.969 --> 01:00:32.969
Ahn Jae Seok!

01:00:33.170 --> 01:00:34.409
You killed a man!

01:00:34.469 --> 01:00:36.309
You treat me like an insect!

01:00:37.309 --> 01:00:39.610
If you spew that kind of nonsense once more,

01:00:39.809 --> 01:00:42.780
your wife and son will get kicked out too.

01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:44.349
This is your last warning.

01:01:00.699 --> 01:01:07.570
