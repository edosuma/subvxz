WEBVTT

00:00.600 --> 00:04.016
TACO: Gentlemen, just because
football season's over doesn't

00:04.136 --> 00:05.771
mean we can't all still hang
out.

00:05.853 --> 00:09.454
And I've been using all my extra
time to refurbish Uncle Frank's

00:09.456 --> 00:13.758
van into Taco Corp World
Headquarters.

00:13.760 --> 00:16.094
KEVIN: This is embarrassing.
PETE: The season's not over,

00:16.096 --> 00:18.163
Taco-- you just didn't make the
playoffs.

00:18.165 --> 00:20.999
(groans) Me neither.
So it is with a heavy heart I'd

00:21.001 --> 00:23.368
like to announce the league's
playoff matchups.

00:23.370 --> 00:26.037
In one bracket, we have Jenny
versus Ruxin.

00:26.039 --> 00:28.607
RUXIN: My team is gonna punch
Jenny right in her balls.

00:28.609 --> 00:31.776
And in the other bracket,
we've got Andre versus Ted.

00:31.778 --> 00:33.845
ANDRE: Andre versus AIDS, a
battle I've been preparing for

00:33.847 --> 00:35.847
my entire life.
And in contention for the

00:35.849 --> 00:37.849
Ruxin...
Yes? I'm listening.

00:37.851 --> 00:40.318
Kevin, Chuck, Taco and myself.

00:40.320 --> 00:42.387
I love you, buddy, but you
got to go.

00:42.389 --> 00:44.723
There are four much less
well-appointed homes that you

00:44.725 --> 00:46.910
will be <i>very</i> happy in.

00:51.031 --> 00:54.566
Geoffrey.
Hi, handsome. How was school?

00:54.568 --> 00:56.835
Good.
Mr. and Mrs. Ruxin, how are

00:56.837 --> 00:58.837
you?
Hi, Father Zaragosa.

00:58.839 --> 01:00.839
Geoffrey's such a wonderful
student.

01:00.841 --> 01:02.474
Aw.
Thank you.

01:02.476 --> 01:04.476
You know, we're doing a
performance at the end of the

01:04.477 --> 01:06.578
semester, and we would love for
Geoffrey to be in it.

01:06.580 --> 01:08.580
Really?
That's great.

01:08.582 --> 01:10.582
He takes after his old man.
I did some theater in high

01:10.584 --> 01:12.217
school.
Those drama girls were so messed

01:12.219 --> 01:14.219
up in the head.
They were easy pickings for...

01:14.221 --> 01:16.221
(clears throat) So, that's all
I'm gonna say.

01:16.223 --> 01:18.223
Actually, it's our Christmas
pageant, and we would love

01:18.225 --> 01:21.560
Geoffrey to be our Baby Jesus.
Jesus.

01:21.562 --> 01:23.995
Jesus.
Jesus.

01:23.997 --> 01:26.565
Yes.
It's quite an honor.

01:26.567 --> 01:28.600
Isn't there a part for, like,
the guy who runs the Bank of

01:28.602 --> 01:31.870
Bethlehem or Jesus'
entertainment lawyer?

01:31.872 --> 01:35.540
Nothing?
I almost had it.

01:35.542 --> 01:38.410
If I could've just eked into the
playoffs, I would've wiped the

01:38.412 --> 01:40.412
floor with you shit-sippers.
Really?

01:40.414 --> 01:42.747
Yes, my team was built for
the playoffs.

01:42.749 --> 01:45.350
Face it, it's over.
You came in last.

01:45.352 --> 01:47.352
You will be playing in the Sacko
Bowl next week.

01:47.354 --> 01:50.088
(groans) Okay, fine, but
which one of you two will I be

01:50.090 --> 01:52.190
playing in the Sacko?
Not me.

01:52.192 --> 01:55.093
I set my lineup.
You did. In September.

01:55.095 --> 01:57.929
Still, all the more reason for
me to make sure I do not end up

01:57.931 --> 02:01.199
in that goddamn Sacko Bowl.
I think you mean the Ruxin.

02:01.201 --> 02:03.201
Whatever you want to call it,
I have never been in that

02:03.203 --> 02:05.537
despicable thing.
In fact, I'm taking some time

02:05.539 --> 02:07.539
off of work to focus on what's
really important.

02:07.541 --> 02:09.541
You're taking vacation days
for fantasy football?

02:09.543 --> 02:11.142
Oh, you're goddamn right I am.

02:11.144 --> 02:13.411
Look, I'm following all of my
players on Twitter right now.

02:13.413 --> 02:15.413
Vernon Davis, spending some
quality time with the family.

02:15.415 --> 02:17.415
His spirits are up.
Might have an extra couple of

02:17.417 --> 02:19.484
points in that.
Anquan Boldin just had his

02:19.486 --> 02:21.486
favorite paella ever.
That could be a little heavy,

02:21.488 --> 02:23.488
might slow him down.
These are the things you got to

02:23.490 --> 02:25.490
think of.
The edge.

02:25.492 --> 02:28.927
W-We'll discuss it when I get
home, okay?

02:28.929 --> 02:30.929
That was my beautiful wife.
Wants to raise our children

02:30.931 --> 02:32.931
Catholic.
Oh, Catholics versus the

02:32.933 --> 02:34.566
Jews.
What's the spread on that game?

02:34.568 --> 02:36.568
Uh, let's just say the
Conquistadors are favored.

02:36.570 --> 02:38.570
Didn't you guys decide that
by putting Geoffrey in that

02:38.572 --> 02:40.572
Catholic school?
Well, we were gonna send him

02:40.574 --> 02:43.508
to a synagogue preschool, but
then Sukkot happened.

02:43.510 --> 02:45.577
Oh, that was such an awesome
party-- we should do that again

02:45.579 --> 02:47.579
sometime.
I agree, actually.

02:47.581 --> 02:49.581
Didn't you discuss this
before you got married?

02:49.583 --> 02:51.583
No, the only thing I talked
to Sofia about before we got

02:51.585 --> 02:53.585
married was, "Where can I fly
you?"

02:53.587 --> 02:55.754
"Your brother seems like a
really sweet guy."

02:55.756 --> 02:57.756
And, "How long do you want me to
go down on you before you just

02:57.758 --> 03:01.126
give up on having an orgasm?"
Oh, slap.

03:01.128 --> 03:03.328
(whoops)
You trying to... tickle my

03:03.330 --> 03:05.597
meaty clackers?
No, you do... you do that and

03:05.599 --> 03:07.599
then that's what guys do when
they're talking about pussy.

03:07.601 --> 03:09.601
Oh, God, Andre.
What? That's what happens.

03:09.603 --> 03:11.569
What guys do you talk about
that with?

03:11.571 --> 03:14.272
Steven, Max, Gary.
The guys in my squash club.

03:14.274 --> 03:16.241
Pussy-talking dudes do that.
(groans) Enough!

03:16.243 --> 03:18.276
All right, enough.
Listen to me, Catholicism's not

03:18.278 --> 03:20.278
that bad.
You'll get used to it.

03:20.280 --> 03:22.313
No, if my kid is gonna hate
Jews, it's 'cause he's

03:22.315 --> 03:26.685
self-loathing, not 'cause he's
anti-Semitic.

03:26.687 --> 03:30.955
(exhales)
Password?

03:30.957 --> 03:34.826
(beep)
What is going on here?

03:34.828 --> 03:37.128
(beep)
JENNY: What you doing?

03:37.130 --> 03:39.130
What... When did you put a
password on your computer?

03:39.132 --> 03:41.132
When I got into the playoffs
and I didn't want you messing

03:41.134 --> 03:43.134
with my lineup.
I'm not gonna mess with your

03:43.136 --> 03:45.503
lineup.
I can look at your lineup.

03:45.505 --> 03:47.539
And then, you know, maybe, if
you want, I could probably give

03:47.541 --> 03:49.574
you my advice.
No, I'm good.

03:49.576 --> 03:51.843
Why don't you want my advice?
'Cause I'm <i>in</i> the playoffs.

03:51.845 --> 03:53.478
You are not.
I should be in the playoffs

03:53.480 --> 03:55.480
and you know that.
How 'bout you just look at

03:55.482 --> 03:57.482
these playoffs as a little "too
hot to handle."

03:57.484 --> 03:59.484
We're not gonna let that go,
are we? We're just not.

03:59.486 --> 04:01.086
No. It's too good.
Okay.

04:01.088 --> 04:03.088
Hey, will you do me a favor?
Will you get Taco out of the

04:03.090 --> 04:04.723
attic?
How do you know he's in the

04:04.725 --> 04:06.357
attic?
(sniffs) You don't smell

04:06.359 --> 04:08.059
that?
(sniffs) Oh, my God.

04:08.061 --> 04:10.161
That's Afghani Kush.
I got to get him out.

04:10.163 --> 04:12.163
Can you come down from there,
please?

04:12.165 --> 04:14.866
Oh, God, are you using my
watering can as a guest bong?

04:14.868 --> 04:17.101
Yeah, I lost your gun.
What?!

04:17.103 --> 04:20.271
Oh, ho, ho. Guys, sit down.
I got big news.

04:20.273 --> 04:22.140
(sighs) What?
I have a secret.

04:22.142 --> 04:23.808
We don't want to know it.
Don't care.

04:23.810 --> 04:26.144
If I tell you, you have to
promise that you don't share it.

04:26.146 --> 04:28.146
I don't want to know it.
I do not want to know it.

04:28.148 --> 04:30.148
Fine, I'm gonna tell you.
Drumroll, please.

04:30.150 --> 04:33.485
(sighs)
(mimicking dramatic drumroll)

04:33.487 --> 04:37.288
Just tell the goddamn secret,
Andre!

04:37.290 --> 04:40.225
Okay, all right.
You dragged it out of me.

04:40.227 --> 04:43.661
I... am Vernon Davis.
Huh?

04:43.663 --> 04:45.830
What?
On Twitter, I am Vernon

04:45.832 --> 04:49.634
Davis.
Oh. Ho, ho.

04:49.636 --> 04:51.770
Created a fake Twitter
account that Pete has been

04:51.772 --> 04:54.939
following since the draft.
And I have just been loading it

04:54.941 --> 04:57.408
with all good information.
And then?

04:57.410 --> 05:00.278
I'm gonna pull the plug.
I want to see Pete go down hard.

05:00.280 --> 05:03.681
In the Sacko.
Andre. Look at that.

05:03.683 --> 05:05.750
That's the long con right there,
buddy.

05:05.752 --> 05:07.352
Exactly.
You know, Pete has been getting

05:07.354 --> 05:10.488
the best of me all year.
But now my revenge will be as

05:10.490 --> 05:14.359
sweet as dulce de leche.
Mwah.

05:14.361 --> 05:16.461
That, coming from the Little
Debbie of our league.

05:16.463 --> 05:18.463
This is awesome.
Pete is gonna flip out when I

05:18.465 --> 05:20.465
tell him.
I know, right? Wait, what?

05:20.467 --> 05:22.467
No, no.
He doesn't even know.

05:22.469 --> 05:24.202
Th-That's the...
It's a secret.

05:24.204 --> 05:26.838
You can't tell him.
No, it's <i>our</i> secret, so we're

05:26.840 --> 05:29.541
gonna get <i>our</i> revenge on Pete.
Please do not tell Pete.

05:29.543 --> 05:31.176
Fine, I'm gonna tell Vernon
Davis.

05:31.178 --> 05:33.178
Tell Vernon Davis.
Do you know Vernon Davis?

05:33.180 --> 05:35.180
I know <i>a</i> Vernon Davis.
Great, get him on the phone.

05:35.182 --> 05:37.782
I will. Thank you.
You dummy.

05:40.361 --> 05:42.767
All right, gents.
It's been a pleasure expensing

05:43.007 --> 05:44.325
this lunch with you.
Shall we head back to the

05:44.457 --> 05:46.124
office?
Brian, I'll definitely run those

05:46.126 --> 05:48.159
ideas up the flagpole, okay?
All right.

05:48.161 --> 05:50.161
I kind of miss it.
I miss it a lot.

05:50.163 --> 05:52.196
It's so easy.
'Cause here's the thing: I

05:52.198 --> 05:54.799
get you and I always have.
You totally do.

05:54.801 --> 05:57.635
I've needed to talk about it
with someone, and... it's been

05:57.637 --> 06:00.405
so hard with Kevin.
And this feels good.

06:00.407 --> 06:02.407
I wish we had done this a
very long time ago.

06:02.409 --> 06:04.742
We're a good team.
So, what exactly did you see?

06:04.744 --> 06:06.844
I saw Jenny with her
ex-boyfriend, Ben, having lunch.

06:06.846 --> 06:08.846
I'm not sure anything is
happening.

06:08.848 --> 06:10.481
I just felt I should report it
to you.

06:10.483 --> 06:12.817
Really? "Sex record" Ben?
Sex record Ben.

06:12.819 --> 06:14.419
Yeah.
Were they having any alcohol?

06:14.421 --> 06:16.421
There was a wine.
I think, maybe a light beer.

06:16.423 --> 06:18.856
What were they snacking on?
I don't kn...

06:18.858 --> 06:21.359
Pretzels, peanuts?
Were there any apps?

06:21.361 --> 06:23.594
Are you concerned about your
wife's fidelity or are you just

06:23.596 --> 06:25.696
hungry right now?
Little bit of both.

06:25.698 --> 06:27.832
Okay. I see.
Hey, guys, hi.

06:27.834 --> 06:29.834
Hey.
Uh, did you remember to take

06:29.836 --> 06:34.072
dinner out of the freezer?
I didn't.

06:34.074 --> 06:36.674
Let me guess, were you
piddling with your fantasy

06:36.676 --> 06:38.743
fantasy lineup?
Yeah, I was, babe.

06:38.745 --> 06:40.878
You know I should be playing Ted
in the playoffs.

06:40.880 --> 06:43.448
But you're not.
You're not in the playoffs,

06:43.450 --> 06:45.883
Kevin.
You know what, just call up

06:45.885 --> 06:47.885
wherever and order take-out.
I don't...

06:47.887 --> 06:49.887
Fine.
Well, she doesn't seem very

06:49.889 --> 06:51.889
happy.
I mean, with Georgia-- what

06:51.891 --> 06:53.891
was wrong with their
relationship?

06:53.893 --> 06:55.893
I mean, was her husband doing
something wrong?

06:55.895 --> 06:58.129
I think she felt that he was
not very attentive and was just

06:58.131 --> 07:02.233
a bit neglectful.
Neglectful.

07:02.235 --> 07:06.037
(whoops)
Game time.

07:06.039 --> 07:09.373
(sighs)
I got it.

07:09.375 --> 07:11.742
Oh.
Hey.

07:11.744 --> 07:13.744
You working hard?
What? At least I'm not

07:13.746 --> 07:15.947
watching porn.
No, don't stop.

07:15.949 --> 07:18.149
It felt good, babe. Kevin?
Kevi...?

07:18.151 --> 07:20.585
(snoring)
Kevin!

07:20.587 --> 07:22.587
What? I'm good.
Let's get back into it.

07:22.589 --> 07:24.555
You don't think Jenny would
cheat on me, do you?

07:24.557 --> 07:26.324
Look, if she was gonna piddle
around outside the marriage, I

07:26.326 --> 07:28.226
think she would have had that
pounded out of her years ago.

07:28.228 --> 07:30.328
Did she say what we were
having for dinner?

07:30.330 --> 07:32.563
I'm starving.
You're joking, right?

07:32.565 --> 07:34.732
What?
If she's making meatloaf, we got

07:34.734 --> 07:37.301
to get out of here.
It sucks.

07:37.303 --> 07:39.470
Hi, Daddy.
Geoffrey, you can't come in

07:39.472 --> 07:41.739
here when Daddy's doing his
shame business, all right?

07:41.741 --> 07:43.941
It smells like miso soup.
'Cause Daddy's filled with

07:43.943 --> 07:46.477
sour water, okay?
So, let's close the door now,

07:46.479 --> 07:48.846
okay?
Bye.

07:48.848 --> 07:51.482
Hey, Ruxin!
Rafi, what are you doing in

07:51.484 --> 07:53.851
here?
Look at you.

07:53.853 --> 07:56.487
Just <i>taking</i> a shit.
Did you tell Baby Geoffrey to

07:56.489 --> 07:58.756
come in here?
Well, I didn't tell him to

07:58.758 --> 08:00.758
come in here, but, like, he and
I have an open-door bathroom

08:00.760 --> 08:02.960
policy.
We always hang out when one of

08:02.962 --> 08:05.163
us is doing a number two.
You let him talk to you while

08:05.165 --> 08:07.165
you're on the toilet?
We're dump buddies.

08:07.167 --> 08:09.367
Rafi, please evacuate so that
I can evacuate.

08:09.369 --> 08:11.969
I love you, man.
Get out of here!

08:11.971 --> 08:14.372
Do you hear me?
Just... say it back, and I'll

08:14.374 --> 08:17.275
take off.
Fine, you can stay.

08:17.277 --> 08:19.677
I'm gonna jerk off while you
do this.

08:19.679 --> 08:22.046
Oh, God, I love you, I love
you.

08:22.048 --> 08:24.482
I'll see you in a minute.
Rafi, is this why Geoffrey's

08:24.484 --> 08:26.817
always trying to go number two
with the door open?

08:26.819 --> 08:29.020
Yeah. You shouldn't have
closed doors in the house.

08:29.022 --> 08:31.322
It's rude.
I don't know why you're such an

08:31.324 --> 08:33.724
anti-social shitter.
Hi, brother.

08:33.726 --> 08:36.126
Hello, beautiful.
Look at you. Oh.

08:36.129 --> 08:38.529
Look at these tits. Oh.
They're getting bigger.

08:38.530 --> 08:40.898
Wow.
Hey, congratulations.

08:40.900 --> 08:43.301
I heard Baby Geoffrey got cast
as Jesus Christ in the Christmas

08:43.303 --> 08:45.503
pageant.
Mm. Yeah, we're flattered.

08:45.505 --> 08:47.872
Yeah.
Ah, flattered but probably

08:47.874 --> 08:50.308
gonna turn it down.
No, we're not.

08:50.310 --> 08:52.510
I was Jesus every year in the
Christmas pageant.

08:52.512 --> 08:54.412
No, you were Judas or Satan.
I was cast as Judas every

08:54.414 --> 08:56.647
year, and they would cast some
goody-goody as Jesus.

08:56.649 --> 08:59.217
And that kid would get hurt, and
I knew all his lines, so I'd

08:59.219 --> 09:01.652
wind up playing Jesus.
Whoa, hold on a second.

09:01.654 --> 09:04.021
We need to decide on what
Geoffrey's religious upbringing

09:04.023 --> 09:06.424
is gonna be.
Yeah.

09:06.426 --> 09:08.693
How about this?
We expose him to both

09:08.695 --> 09:10.861
Catholicism and Judaism, and
then, we let him decide.

09:10.863 --> 09:13.064
All right, that's fair.
Holy war. I like this.

09:13.066 --> 09:15.266
It's not a holy war.
We're gonna crush you.

09:15.268 --> 09:17.702
We have the only direct access
to our Lord and Savior, Jesus

09:17.704 --> 09:19.904
Christ.
So, I'm assuming you're a

09:19.906 --> 09:22.273
devout Catholic?
Very religious.

09:22.275 --> 09:24.275
He used to be an altar boy.
I ran into a little bit of

09:24.277 --> 09:26.444
trouble with one of the priests,
though.

09:26.446 --> 09:28.679
Were you sexually abused?
Other way around, buddy.

09:28.681 --> 09:31.048
I abused him.
He didn't want to do anything.

09:31.050 --> 09:33.451
He wound up leaving the
priesthood.

09:33.453 --> 09:35.686
Said what I'd done to him was
proof that God didn't exist on

09:35.688 --> 09:38.055
Earth.
He lives in Ibiza now.

09:38.057 --> 09:40.458
I can't believe you two share
genetic material.

09:40.460 --> 09:43.394
Oh, we have in the past, but
not in a long time.

09:43.396 --> 09:45.596
Let's talk about lunch.
That tapas place-- it-it's not

09:45.598 --> 09:47.965
transporting well.
There he is.

09:47.967 --> 09:50.201
That's Andre?
Uh-huh. What's up, Andre?

09:50.203 --> 09:52.203
Oh, my God. Vernon Davis?
How do you know Vernon Davis?

09:52.205 --> 09:54.405
You told me I could tell the
Vernon Davis I know.

09:54.407 --> 09:56.407
This is the Vernon Davis I know.
Well, how do you know him?

09:56.409 --> 09:58.809
He's my Eskimo brother.
Yeah.

09:58.811 --> 10:00.978
Really?
Hey, Andre, I want to talk to

10:00.980 --> 10:03.147
you about this fake Twitter
account.

10:03.149 --> 10:05.149
I'm so sorry about this, and
I-I can take it down, I'll do

10:05.151 --> 10:07.318
whatever.
He told me this Pete guy's

10:07.320 --> 10:09.287
been picking on you all year.
I want to help you fight back.

10:09.289 --> 10:11.088
Really? You want to help me?
Pete sleeps with a married

10:11.090 --> 10:13.090
woman, and you get punched in
the face? That ain't right.

10:13.092 --> 10:14.992
You don't mind that I'm
running your Twitter account?

10:14.994 --> 10:16.961
No, but I don't like that
you're making me look so lame.

10:16.963 --> 10:19.397
Andre, look.
I like Rascal Flatts?

10:19.399 --> 10:21.799
Yeah.
Trucker hats?

10:21.801 --> 10:23.768
How come every pair of pants
that I buy are bedazzled?

10:23.770 --> 10:25.670
Because you work hard on your
legs, you want to show 'em off.

10:25.672 --> 10:27.505
Get those spangles out there.
Andre, I'm gonna let this

10:27.507 --> 10:29.440
fake Vernon Davis continue on
one condition.

10:29.442 --> 10:31.342
Sure, anything.
You have to let Taco write

10:31.344 --> 10:33.477
all the Tweets.
Okay, but you don't know

10:33.479 --> 10:35.313
anything about football.
But I know everything about

10:35.315 --> 10:37.748
Vernon Davis.
Thanks, Taco.

10:37.750 --> 10:39.817
All right.
I love you, Eskimo brother.

10:39.819 --> 10:41.852
I love you, too, Eskimo
brother.

10:41.854 --> 10:43.788
All right, if you're running
this Twitter account, you have

10:43.790 --> 10:45.790
to keep the Tweets real, okay?
He can't find out.

10:45.792 --> 10:47.692
This is a long con.
Don't worry about it.

10:47.694 --> 10:49.527
I am extremely tech-savvy.
By the way, can I borrow your

10:49.529 --> 10:51.929
fax machine?
For what?

10:51.931 --> 10:53.864
My emergency break's busted,
I need something to put behind

10:53.866 --> 10:55.633
the tire.

10:58.107 --> 11:00.027
Oh, by the way, what happened
with Jenny and Ben?

11:00.155 --> 11:01.675
Did you guys kind of talk
through that?

11:01.734 --> 11:04.627
No, no, no, I remain silent
until she makes a mistake.

11:04.747 --> 11:06.580
Good, I think communication
is sort of a last-resort thing

11:06.582 --> 11:08.782
in marriages.
What are you doing?

11:08.784 --> 11:10.951
I'm following Vernon Davis on
Twitter.

11:10.953 --> 11:12.886
The guy's really interesting.
Apparently, he's, like, a big

11:12.888 --> 11:14.655
fan of Japanese sneakers.
I <i>love</i> Japanese sneakers.

11:14.657 --> 11:16.456
What are you doing, Taco?
Just grabbing some supplies

11:16.458 --> 11:18.292
for TacoCorp headquarters.
Those are Ellie's school

11:18.294 --> 11:20.727
supplies.
Great.

11:20.729 --> 11:22.963
And that is Jenny's computer.
You can't have that.

11:22.965 --> 11:25.065
Oh, I need it for business.
Business?

11:25.067 --> 11:27.234
Yeah.
Well, if you're gonna use the

11:27.236 --> 11:29.069
computer, then you have to tell
me what the password is.

11:29.071 --> 11:31.171
I don't know what the
password is.

11:31.173 --> 11:33.006
Well, then, how are you gonna
use the computer?

11:33.008 --> 11:34.975
Just like I'm using it now.
I don't need a password.

11:34.977 --> 11:36.743
No, you have to open it up,
and then, put a password in to

11:36.745 --> 11:38.979
use it, Taco.
No, you don't.

11:38.981 --> 11:41.114
Look, it's closed. I'm using it.
Stop it, Kevin, you're being

11:41.116 --> 11:42.983
very closed-minded.
Look, it's a bullet-stopper.

11:42.985 --> 11:44.985
(Taco imitates bullets pinging)
Oh, my...

11:44.987 --> 11:46.853
Give me this thing, dingbat.
Hey, let me ask you-- do you

11:46.855 --> 11:48.855
think that Jenny is
cheating on me?

11:48.857 --> 11:50.824
Well, I mean, are you guys
both sleeping with other people?

11:50.826 --> 11:52.826
No, we're sleeping with each
other... exclusively.

11:52.828 --> 11:55.262
What?
Yes.

11:55.264 --> 11:57.464
Then what do you have?
Sex... with each other.

11:57.466 --> 11:59.666
Ugh!
All right, just, everyone

11:59.668 --> 12:01.668
focus on this, please.
I have to try to figure out what

12:01.670 --> 12:04.104
this password is.
Ooh, code breaking.

12:04.106 --> 12:06.473
What a romantic.
"Kevin."

12:06.475 --> 12:08.775
Try the kids' names-- that's
what they do.

12:08.777 --> 12:10.978
"Chalupa."
Uh, his name's Christopher.

12:10.980 --> 12:13.180
I got it.
Try "sex with other men."

12:13.182 --> 12:15.282
And we're in! Yeah.
No, we're not in.

12:15.284 --> 12:19.219
It's not "sex with other men."
You're a dick.

12:19.221 --> 12:21.555
Aw.
Well, we all know this.

12:21.557 --> 12:24.825
Oh, you clearly haven't
looked at the transactions page.

12:24.827 --> 12:29.329
Yup, our friend Ruxin spent last
night adding and then dropping

12:29.331 --> 12:32.032
every single defense in the
league.

12:32.034 --> 12:34.401
I also hate-watched <i>Dancing</i>
<i>with the Stars.</i>

12:34.403 --> 12:36.837
<i>You knew full well that if</i>
<i>you picked up every defense and</i>

12:36.839 --> 12:39.239
<i>then dropped them that nobody</i>
<i>could pick them up for two days</i>

12:39.241 --> 12:41.642
<i>because they'd be on the waiver</i>
<i>wire.</i>

12:41.644 --> 12:44.044
<i>This is a goddamn</i>
<i>roster-churn.</i>

12:44.046 --> 12:46.413
<i>It's a shitty move.</i>
<i>Is it illegal?</i>

12:46.415 --> 12:48.548
<i>No, it's immoral.</i>
<i>And next year, there will be</i>

12:48.550 --> 12:50.484
<i>a rule that makes that illegal.</i>
<i>I guess we could just chalk</i>

12:50.486 --> 12:52.686
<i>this up to classic Ruxin</i>

12:52.688 --> 12:54.821
<i>Oh, bullshit.</i>
<i>If these apps were-were the</i>

12:57.026 --> 12:59.226

<i>...and you ruined it!</i>

12:59.228 --> 13:01.561

Oh, wrong.

15:17.594 --> 15:19.594
Shalom.
Happy Jewish Christmas.

15:19.596 --> 15:21.596
Hey, Ruspin, you want me to
put my Krampus outfit on?

15:21.598 --> 15:23.598
No, absolutely not.
All right, I'm gonna put

15:23.600 --> 15:25.600
these ninja stars on the
Christmas tree.

15:25.602 --> 15:27.735
It's a Jewish star and it's a
Hanukkah bush and you're an

15:27.737 --> 15:29.571
amoeba.
That's a nice hat.

15:29.573 --> 15:31.406
Oh, the yarmulke?
Yeah, it's great, because it

15:31.408 --> 15:33.374
feels like it's constantly about
to fall off.

15:33.376 --> 15:35.443
Andre, maybe I could get one to
cover up that blazer 'cause it

15:35.445 --> 15:37.445
is literally a fashion
holocaust.

15:37.447 --> 15:39.481
Thank you very much, and just
like the Holocaust, you will

15:39.483 --> 15:41.783
never forget it.
Rabbi Kirshenblatt.

15:41.785 --> 15:43.785
Mr. Ruxin.
What a lovely home.

15:43.787 --> 15:46.121
Thank you for coming.
How did you get a rabbi in

15:46.123 --> 15:48.623
this house?
I actually called in my

15:48.625 --> 15:51.926
sister.
You remember Rebecca Ruxin.

15:51.928 --> 15:54.129
Hey, Rebecca, how's it going?
Good to see you.

15:54.131 --> 15:57.799
Yeah, you look just the same.
Maybe a little older.

15:57.801 --> 16:00.468
A little sadder.
I mean, not as old and sad as my

16:00.470 --> 16:03.037
brother, though, thank goodness.
What a light and joy she is.

16:03.039 --> 16:06.307
And to think that Conservadox
Judaism has only made her that

16:06.309 --> 16:09.644
much more palatable.
Well, I was forced to become

16:09.646 --> 16:12.947
a bit more religious in order to
justify being placed in the same

16:12.949 --> 16:15.650
family as the Rod-man.
"Ro-Rod-man"?

16:15.652 --> 16:17.652
"Rod-man".
Rod-man.

16:17.654 --> 16:19.654
You guys don't call him the
Rod-man?

16:19.656 --> 16:21.656
We do now.
Yes, we do.

16:21.658 --> 16:23.658
No, everybody calls me Ruxin.
Rod-man.

16:23.660 --> 16:25.660
Rodney Rod-man.
Dennis Rod-man.

16:25.662 --> 16:27.662
Nice.
You remember Andre, don't you?

16:27.664 --> 16:29.631
Yeah.
To think I had a crush on you in

16:29.633 --> 16:31.633
high school.
How come you never told me?

16:31.635 --> 16:33.635
Well, I wasn't allowed to
tell you.

16:33.637 --> 16:36.337
Or touch you, because it's the
Rod-man's worst nightmare that I

16:36.339 --> 16:38.873
sleep with one of his friends.
I guess I just like my

16:38.875 --> 16:40.909
friends too much.
Hmm.

16:40.911 --> 16:42.911
Hmm.
(both): Hmm.

16:42.913 --> 16:45.413
Hey, Ros-man, why is it that
Jews celebrate Jesus' birthday

16:45.415 --> 16:47.415
over eight days instead of just
one?

16:47.417 --> 16:49.651
For tax purposes.
Taco?

16:49.653 --> 16:52.187
I'm so surprised to see you
still alive.

16:52.189 --> 16:54.189
Oh, I've actually died a
bunch of times.

16:54.191 --> 16:56.324
But the hospital always makes me
alive again.

16:56.326 --> 16:58.660
Thank goodness for that.
I'll tell you everything you

16:58.662 --> 17:00.662
want to know about Hanukkah.
(chuckles): Hanukkah.

17:00.664 --> 17:02.664
Your sister's so funny.
She is funny.

17:02.666 --> 17:04.665
Yeah, she's not funny, okay?
And she cheated at tennis and I

17:04.667 --> 17:06.701
had to let her win or else she'd
throw tantrums.

17:06.703 --> 17:08.536
And I love her very much.
I'm very glad she's here.

17:08.538 --> 17:10.204
This is gonna be a good party.

17:10.207 --> 17:11.873
Yeah.
Anybody want a drink?

17:11.875 --> 17:13.875
Yes.
I'll definitely take a drink.

17:13.877 --> 17:15.742
All right.
Oh, sweetie, will you get me

17:15.744 --> 17:17.579
a... white wine.
J-Dog! Hey.

17:17.580 --> 17:19.580
Ben, you made it.
Oh, heck yeah.

17:19.583 --> 17:21.715
I'm so glad you're here.
Yeah, thank you so much

17:21.718 --> 17:23.851
for the other day.
You know I take care of my

17:23.853 --> 17:25.920
girl, right?
Ah, you always have.

17:25.922 --> 17:27.955
You just, you clarified
everything for me.

17:27.958 --> 17:29.924
You feel good about it?
That's a Jew and Geoffrey's

17:29.926 --> 17:31.859
gonna be a Catholic?
That's a <i>shanda.</i>

17:31.861 --> 17:33.528
<i>I feel good, too, I mean,</i>
<i>honestly, and anytime</i>

17:33.530 --> 17:35.196
<i>you need help...</i>
<i>Are you happy in your</i>

17:35.198 --> 17:36.864
<i>marriage?</i>
<i>Am I?</i>

17:36.866 --> 17:38.533
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>No.</i>

17:38.535 --> 17:40.535
<i>Happier than she is, though.</i>
<i>Clearly. (chuckles)</i>

17:40.537 --> 17:42.537
<i>Uh, what kind of party is</i>
<i>this, anyway?</i>

17:42.539 --> 17:44.572
<i>Oh, this is Ruxin.</i>
<i>He's trying to get his kid into</i>

17:44.574 --> 17:46.574
<i>both hells.</i>
<i>Vernon Davis, holy shit.</i>

17:46.576 --> 17:48.476
<i>He's got a, some kind of huge</i>
<i>injury, what is that?</i>

17:48.478 --> 17:50.478
<i>Oh, yeah, I'm not an</i>
<i>orthopedic surgeon, but...</i>

17:50.480 --> 17:52.480
<i>you got to imagine he's in a</i>
<i>cast for some reason, right?</i>

17:52.482 --> 17:54.482
<i>This is why you follow your</i>
<i>players on Twitter, Andre.</i>

17:54.484 --> 17:56.484
<i>You get the edge.</i>
<i>See, I take a page from your</i>

17:56.486 --> 17:58.486
<i>book, start following my players</i>
<i>on Twitter, right, Taco?</i>

17:58.488 --> 18:00.321
<i>Why are you giving me a</i>
<i>thumbs-up?</i>

18:00.323 --> 18:01.990
<i>Nothing.</i>
<i>Just tell me out loud.</i>

18:01.992 --> 18:03.725
<i>Just go back to the tree.</i>
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

18:03.727 --> 18:05.460
<i>Just giving him a thumbs-up.</i>
<i>The tree looks great.</i>

18:05.462 --> 18:07.462
<i>Thank you. Stop bothering me.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

18:07.464 --> 18:10.064
<i>Rabbi Kirshenblatt, you</i>
<i>remember my wife, Sofia?</i>

18:10.066 --> 18:12.066
<i>Yes, of course.</i>
<i>Shalom.</i>

18:12.068 --> 18:14.068
<i>Shalom.</i>
<i>Santa.</i>

18:14.070 --> 18:16.070
<i>What?</i>
<i>Uh, he's really excited about</i>

18:16.072 --> 18:18.072
<i>Santa.</i>
<i>Aah, he's medium excited</i>

18:18.074 --> 18:20.074
<i>about Santa.</i>
<i>No, he's really excited about</i>

18:20.076 --> 18:22.076
<i>Santa.</i>
<i>He was very excited about</i>

18:22.078 --> 18:24.279
<i>using the big boy toilet, but</i>
<i>remember there were a bunch of</i>

18:24.281 --> 18:26.347
<i>messy lapses along the way,</i>
<i>right?</i>

18:26.349 --> 18:28.416
<i>Yeah, well, the toilet didn't</i>
<i>promise gifts.</i>

18:28.418 --> 18:31.252
<i>Yeah, hey, babe, you were</i>
<i>gonna check on those latkes?</i>

18:31.254 --> 18:33.187
<i>The latk...?</i>
<i>Oh, yes, the Jewish hash browns.</i>

18:33.189 --> 18:35.189
<i>Bye.</i>
<i>Great.</i>

18:35.191 --> 18:37.525
<i>Geoffrey, did you know that the</i>
<i>rabbi's Jewish?</i>

18:37.527 --> 18:41.696
<i>Rafi told me that the Jews</i>
<i>killed Jesus with a knife.</i>

18:41.698 --> 18:44.032
<i>So, you see what I'm dealing</i>
<i>with here?</i>

18:44.034 --> 18:46.834
<i>Well, you know, being a</i>
<i>Jewish person really means being</i>

18:46.836 --> 18:50.338
<i>good to other people.</i>
<i>That's called "ethics."</i>

18:50.340 --> 18:52.440
<i>You know who else is in charge</i>
<i>of ethics?</i>

18:52.442 --> 18:54.776
<i>Your daddy.</i>
<i>I try to be the ethical</i>

18:54.778 --> 18:57.278
<i>cornerstone to my friends and</i>
<i>family.</i>

18:57.280 --> 19:00.214
<i>Yeah, so listen, I've got an</i>
<i>ethical question for you.</i>

19:00.216 --> 19:04.385
<i>Do you think it's ethical to add</i>
<i>and drop ten defenses so nobody</i>

19:04.387 --> 19:07.121
<i>can pick 'em up off the waiver</i>
<i>wire?</i>

19:07.123 --> 19:09.123
<i>Do you play, uh, fantasy</i>
<i>football, Rabbi?</i>

19:09.125 --> 19:11.125
<i>Of course I play fantasy</i>
<i>football.</i>

19:11.127 --> 19:13.127
<i>My team, the Payus Manics, is in</i>
<i>first place.</i>

19:13.129 --> 19:15.663
<i>So let's return to your ethical</i>
<i>question.</i>

19:15.665 --> 19:18.833
<i>Right, well, ethically</i>
<i>speaking...</i>

19:18.835 --> 19:21.636
<i>You know, the-the beauty of</i>
<i>ethics is it's relative, isn't</i>

19:21.638 --> 19:23.638
<i>it?</i>
<i>No, no, no, no, no.</i>

19:23.640 --> 19:25.807
<i>To a Jew, it's right or it's</i>
<i>wrong.</i>

19:25.809 --> 19:27.842
<i>Well, as a Jew...</i>
<i>Mm-hmm?</i>

19:27.844 --> 19:29.911
<i>Uh, who wants to be Jewish</i>
<i>and raise my son Jewish, I would</i>

19:29.913 --> 19:32.413
<i>teach him that it would be...</i>
<i>(clears throat)</i>

19:32.415 --> 19:35.650
<i>...unethical...</i>
<i>to roster-churn and I would</i>

19:35.652 --> 19:39.020
<i>return those defenses to the</i>
<i>open market for anybody to pick</i>

19:39.022 --> 19:41.155
<i>up.</i>
<i>Shalom!</i>

19:41.157 --> 19:43.157
<i>The wisdom of Solomon.</i>
<i>I wish I could cut this</i>

19:43.159 --> 19:45.159
<i>league in half.</i>
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

19:45.161 --> 19:46.994
<i>Ruxin just put all the defenses</i>
<i>back up on the wire.</i>

19:46.996 --> 19:48.663
<i>Ooh, yes.</i>
<i>I know, it's so good.</i>

19:48.665 --> 19:50.531
<i>But I need you, like, we're</i>
<i>gonna have to, like, seriously</i>

19:50.533 --> 19:52.367
<i>powwow.</i>
<i>We got to meet up and talk</i>

19:52.369 --> 19:54.369
<i>about it, because...</i>
<i>Okay, all right, that's</i>

19:54.371 --> 19:56.371
<i>enough, you know what?</i>
<i>Stop touching my wife, please.</i>

19:56.373 --> 19:58.373
<i>You're being really rude</i>
<i>right now.</i>

19:58.375 --> 20:00.541
<i>Oh, really?</i> I'm being rude?
I'm sorry, did I interrupt

20:00.543 --> 20:02.710
the conversation with you and
record-setting Ben over here?

20:02.712 --> 20:05.913
Look, I am sorry that I
neglected you and took you for

20:05.915 --> 20:08.416
granted and I'm sorry that I
fell asleep during oral.

20:08.418 --> 20:10.685
Oh, I am sorry that you said
that out loud.

20:10.687 --> 20:13.221
Don't apologize for that.
Do you think that...?

20:13.223 --> 20:15.356
Yeah.
Oh, man, no, no, no, no, no.

20:15.358 --> 20:18.059
I am very happily married.
And <i>I</i> am happily married.

20:18.061 --> 20:20.094
Nothing is happening between
us.

20:20.096 --> 20:21.963
Just helping a buddy out, you
know, she wanted help with her

20:21.965 --> 20:23.798
lineup, I'm really good at that
kind of stuff.

20:23.800 --> 20:25.633
What? You helped my wife
with her lineup?

20:25.635 --> 20:27.468
He gave some very good fantasy.

20:27.470 --> 20:29.303
Are you kidding me?
You let him help you?

20:29.305 --> 20:31.305
I'm just really good at...
All right, shut your mouth,

20:31.307 --> 20:33.307
man.
I'm, I give amaz...

20:33.309 --> 20:35.309
Oh!
Jewish hash browns!

20:35.311 --> 20:37.311
Oh, shit.
They're called latkes, you

20:37.313 --> 20:39.313
goddamn <i>shiksa.</i>
<i>You people are insane.</i>

20:39.315 --> 20:41.403
<i>What a shiska?</i>
<i>Oy.</i>
