01:27.054 --> 01:28.686
Don't you like country music?

01:30.356 --> 01:32.323
No ma'am, I can't say I do.

01:33.293 --> 01:35.493
Well what don't
you like about it?

01:37.396 --> 01:38.530
Just about everything.

01:40.301 --> 01:41.733
Especially the lyrics.

01:41.734 --> 01:43.701
I don't understand what the
hell they're singing about

01:43.704 --> 01:44.936
half the time.

01:44.938 --> 01:47.171
It ain't too hard to understand.

01:47.774 --> 01:49.674
Maybe you're just thinking
about it too hard.

01:50.310 --> 01:51.609
You just have to dance.

01:54.313 --> 01:55.480
Like this.

02:00.153 --> 02:02.019
- Danny: Well...
- Charlene.

02:04.257 --> 02:06.625
Well Charlene, I hate
to break it to you, but...

02:08.495 --> 02:09.728
I don't dance.

02:12.132 --> 02:13.831
You don't like country music,

02:14.734 --> 02:16.200
and you don't dance.

02:17.836 --> 02:20.639
So what the hell are you
doing in a honky tonk joint?

02:22.175 --> 02:24.342
I'm just out looking
for the perfect girl.

02:25.745 --> 02:27.478
It was the only
bar on the strip.

02:28.413 --> 02:30.414
Hmm. Perfect girl, huh?

02:32.519 --> 02:34.086
And have you found her?

02:36.588 --> 02:38.656
Too early in the
night to say just yet.

02:40.026 --> 02:41.759
- Smile like yours,

02:42.194 --> 02:43.495
I might be getting closer.

02:44.197 --> 02:45.930
You're sweet as sugar.

02:47.099 --> 02:48.667
What was your name again?

02:48.668 --> 02:50.034
Danny.

02:50.037 --> 02:51.537
Charlene: Danny,
I'm Charlene.

02:52.104 --> 02:54.338
- I remember.

02:54.341 --> 02:55.774
Right.

02:55.776 --> 02:57.509
I guess I've had a few too many.

02:58.711 --> 03:01.079
Now, you wouldn't take
advantage of me, would you?

03:02.649 --> 03:03.848
No, ma'am.

03:05.685 --> 03:07.352
Not unless you want me to.

03:07.854 --> 03:09.721
I don't know what
she's up to over there.

03:12.325 --> 03:14.092
And if I wanted you to?

03:17.329 --> 03:19.230
Let's say you and I go out back,

03:19.566 --> 03:21.066
get some fresh air,

03:21.533 --> 03:23.467
get to know each
other a bit better.

03:23.469 --> 03:24.635
Okay.

03:27.807 --> 03:29.608
You sure your fellow won't mind?

03:31.644 --> 03:35.046
Tony? He's my brother.
He don't give a damn what I do.

03:35.747 --> 03:37.316
Fair enough. Let's go.

03:59.405 --> 04:01.240
You taking me out
here to kiss me?

04:03.242 --> 04:04.342
Maybe.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.411
I sure hope so.

04:21.360 --> 04:23.629
Donny, you taste good.

04:24.630 --> 04:25.797
It's Danny.

04:26.966 --> 04:29.067
Danny, Donny,
whatever your name is,

04:29.069 --> 04:31.036
why don't you come
over and kiss me?

04:31.903 --> 04:34.406
Is Donny the name of the
last guy you took out here?

04:37.377 --> 04:41.045
I think it was you who
brought me out here, slick.

04:42.615 --> 04:44.783
My name ain't slick.

04:44.784 --> 04:46.384
It's Danny.

04:46.786 --> 04:49.187
I think that slick...

04:50.555 --> 04:52.024
Suits you better.

04:53.925 --> 04:56.327
You don't even care
what my name is, do you?

04:58.130 --> 05:00.031
Don't even care who I really am.

05:01.300 --> 05:02.834
Baby, right now,

05:03.336 --> 05:05.536
I know all I wanna know.

05:12.745 --> 05:14.012
So do I.

05:16.783 --> 05:17.882
What's that?

06:35.728 --> 06:38.430
Woman: <i>I don't want to be
this girl that I am right now!</i>

06:38.432 --> 06:39.764
Man: <i> Well too fucking bad!</i>

06:39.766 --> 06:41.533
<i>This is the girl
you are right now!</i>

06:41.534 --> 06:43.067
Woman: <i> No no no no no!</i>

06:43.069 --> 06:44.536
Man: <i>Yeah, you're
a little fucking whore</i>

06:44.538 --> 06:47.238
<i>who's gonna suck my cock
and then I'm gonna fuck you!</i>

06:47.240 --> 06:49.540
Woman: <i>No! I'm not gonna suck
your cock anyway</i>

06:49.543 --> 06:51.209
<i>because it's too small!</i>

06:51.211 --> 06:53.110
Man: <i> Oh you fucking...</i>

06:54.680 --> 06:57.581
Man: <i>That ought to teach you
a lesson, you fucking bitch!</i>

06:59.418 --> 07:01.586
<i>Mind your own business, pal!</i>

07:02.053 --> 07:04.923
<i>You are so fucking
lucky I picked you up!</i>

07:04.925 --> 07:07.425
<i>Who else is gonna love you?
Nobody!</i>

07:07.427 --> 07:10.362
<i>I love you like you're my own
because you are my own!</i>

07:11.798 --> 07:13.432
Man: <i>You're fucking
sucker tail.</i>

07:13.434 --> 07:14.932
<i>That's all you are.</i>

07:15.802 --> 07:17.334
What the hell do you want?

07:17.970 --> 07:19.271
It's early.

07:19.273 --> 07:21.038
Some people are trying
to sleep around here.

07:21.040 --> 07:23.442
Get lost, pal,
before I kick your ass!

07:24.776 --> 07:27.312
Get the hell out!

07:27.314 --> 07:29.146
You motherfucker!

07:29.649 --> 07:31.048
- Keep it down.

07:31.050 --> 07:32.651
Stop hitting your girlfriend,

07:33.452 --> 07:35.720
or you won't have any
fingers left to hit her with.

07:35.721 --> 07:37.788
All right, man, take it easy.

07:37.790 --> 07:40.225
We'll keep it down.

07:41.461 --> 07:42.661
Good idea.

07:46.665 --> 07:49.634
Do yourself a favor, darling.
Get a new boyfriend.

07:52.639 --> 07:54.372
Pretty girl like you
deserves better.

08:02.682 --> 08:03.814
Asshole!

08:50.062 --> 08:51.830
- Morning.
- Danny: Morning.

08:57.802 --> 08:58.937
Sleep all right?

09:00.038 --> 09:01.472
No ma'am, not especially.

09:02.307 --> 09:04.775
You got some real
low-life scum in 122.

09:05.410 --> 09:07.144
I heard him throwing
around his girlfriend.

09:07.147 --> 09:08.679
Might wanna call the cops.

09:08.682 --> 09:09.813
Great.

09:10.816 --> 09:12.583
That's just what I need.

09:16.423 --> 09:17.889
You ought to give that up.

09:18.557 --> 09:19.924
That stuff will kill you.

09:57.129 --> 09:58.296
Oh come on.

10:00.865 --> 10:02.200
Yeah.

10:02.201 --> 10:05.437
Come on, pumpkin,
we got places to go.

10:10.942 --> 10:12.177
Atta girl.

11:49.140 --> 11:50.408
Can I get you something?

11:50.409 --> 11:52.744
Yes, ma'am, how
about some coffee?

11:52.745 --> 11:54.412
Candy: All right, you
want cream and sugar?

11:54.413 --> 11:55.813
No, ma'am, black.

11:56.514 --> 11:57.915
Anything else?

11:58.817 --> 12:02.553
How about chicken-fried
steak and eggs?

12:02.556 --> 12:04.089
How do you want those eggs?

12:04.856 --> 12:07.424
Sunny side up, just like you.

12:08.594 --> 12:10.828
Sure thing.

12:10.831 --> 12:13.465
Thanks, candy.

12:15.167 --> 12:16.567
You got it.

12:37.423 --> 12:39.624
It's a damn shame what
happened to that girl.

12:41.059 --> 12:43.027
You can't trust
anyone these days.

12:43.863 --> 12:45.462
- You sure can't.

12:46.197 --> 12:49.100
I used to go to that
bar myself, but I stopped.

12:50.101 --> 12:51.602
Too many weirdos.

12:54.038 --> 12:55.206
Where do you go now?

12:56.241 --> 12:58.676
Um... nowhere really.
I just work.

12:59.544 --> 13:01.111
What time you get off of work?

13:01.114 --> 13:03.181
7:00.

13:08.086 --> 13:10.554
How about I take you out
for a steak dinner afterwards?

13:12.091 --> 13:14.658
That's a lot
of steak in one day.

13:14.660 --> 13:16.161
You sure you can handle it?

13:16.828 --> 13:18.462
- Oh I'm positive.

13:21.734 --> 13:22.833
All right.

13:26.272 --> 13:27.471
Give you my number?

13:27.474 --> 13:28.673
Call me around 8:00

13:28.674 --> 13:30.808
and I'll tell you where
to come pick me up?

13:31.243 --> 13:33.977
- That sounds like a plan.

13:47.592 --> 13:49.994
I'll go get your steak.

13:49.995 --> 13:51.863
- Danny: I'll be here.
- Okay.

14:27.633 --> 14:29.366
- Danny: Here you go.
- Such a gentleman.

14:37.375 --> 14:39.076
Hope you like country music.

14:39.745 --> 14:41.980
I hope that steak's as
good as you said it was.

14:41.981 --> 14:44.782
Oh, it's good.

14:47.019 --> 14:48.753
Dessert's even better though.

15:04.669 --> 15:06.537
Danny: After you.

15:06.538 --> 15:08.505
Thank you, again.
Such a gentleman.

15:10.743 --> 15:13.977
Sorry, I wasn't
expecting company.

15:14.879 --> 15:16.681
- Don't mention it.

15:17.416 --> 15:19.583
We're gonna be putting more
clothes on the floor anyhow.

15:19.586 --> 15:20.784
Yeah.

16:25.850 --> 16:27.652
Billy, that was amazing.

16:28.687 --> 16:31.254
That is the best I've had in...

16:32.825 --> 16:35.493
Ever... actually.

16:36.427 --> 16:38.763
It was good on
this end too, candy.

16:38.764 --> 16:41.032
I'm glad you came into my diner.

16:43.702 --> 16:45.135
That makes two of us.

16:48.039 --> 16:49.941
What brought you
down here anyway?

16:51.543 --> 16:52.777
The highway.

16:56.048 --> 16:58.015
Well I know that, smarty pants.

16:58.549 --> 17:00.751
I mean,
like what brought you here.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.120
I just told you.

17:07.159 --> 17:08.259
I see.

17:10.328 --> 17:11.863
You like to drive?

17:14.633 --> 17:15.767
I do.

17:17.635 --> 17:18.803
Me too.

17:20.405 --> 17:24.208
Sometimes I wish I could just
drive right out of this town.

17:25.810 --> 17:27.077
Well why don't you?

17:31.916 --> 17:33.250
Where'd I go?

17:34.586 --> 17:36.119
Anywhere you want.

17:38.589 --> 17:39.723
No.

17:40.592 --> 17:41.893
I've been here my whole life.

17:41.894 --> 17:43.894
I mean, I'd have to start
all over again.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.765
But sometimes I wish I could.

17:49.101 --> 17:50.500
No one's holding you back.

17:51.170 --> 17:52.502
Do it.

17:54.339 --> 17:55.506
No.

17:57.175 --> 17:58.576
It'd be too hard.

18:00.913 --> 18:02.680
Besides, who am I gonna go with?

18:05.717 --> 18:07.751
People always have excuses.

18:09.253 --> 18:11.788
They never do
what they really wanna do.

18:13.592 --> 18:15.125
They just wait

18:15.127 --> 18:17.662
for someone to come and
solve all their problems,

18:18.696 --> 18:22.099
because they're too afraid
to make any change on their own.

18:23.201 --> 18:24.434
It's pathetic.

18:27.538 --> 18:28.873
I'm not afraid.

18:30.709 --> 18:31.875
You're not?

18:33.144 --> 18:34.211
No.

18:36.315 --> 18:37.682
You sure?

18:41.452 --> 18:42.819
I need a cigarette.

18:51.063 --> 18:52.630
I hate cigarettes.

18:53.664 --> 18:56.567
I was engaged to a girl who
used to smoke that same brand.

19:02.508 --> 19:05.076
Well if you wanna leave,
the door's right there.

19:05.743 --> 19:08.078
It's my apartment.
I'll smoke if I want to.

20:57.888 --> 20:59.522
You look like shit, man.

21:01.460 --> 21:02.759
I know.

21:06.397 --> 21:08.598
I haven't had a good
night's sleep in a month.

21:10.701 --> 21:11.935
Christ.

21:12.738 --> 21:14.271
Has it been that long?

21:16.407 --> 21:18.643
The police still haven't
caught that fucker.

21:19.778 --> 21:22.046
Not a single goddamn suspect.

21:23.248 --> 21:25.016
There's been more killing since,

21:26.050 --> 21:30.320
mostly blondes, all...
Cut up the exact same way.

21:33.057 --> 21:35.125
It's gotta be him, man.
I know it is.

21:38.930 --> 21:40.964
Look, man, you don't
even know who killed her.

21:41.566 --> 21:42.767
It could've been anyone.

21:42.769 --> 21:44.134
I know, okay.

21:48.240 --> 21:50.374
I looked him right in the eye.

21:51.609 --> 21:53.344
That fucker smiled at me.

21:54.613 --> 21:55.712
It was him.

21:57.481 --> 21:58.715
I just...

22:00.585 --> 22:04.055
Wish I would've...
Done something, you know.

22:05.923 --> 22:07.223
Now she's gone.

22:09.760 --> 22:11.194
They'll catch him
sooner or later.

22:11.630 --> 22:12.997
They got to.

22:12.999 --> 22:15.665
They're not doing a very
good fucking job of it so far!

22:21.707 --> 22:22.772
Look, man.

22:24.175 --> 22:26.277
The news says the
killings are headed east.

22:27.679 --> 22:29.946
I can't just keep
on sitting around

22:29.949 --> 22:31.548
waiting for the
cops to find him.

22:34.118 --> 22:35.685
I'm gonna follow his trail,

22:36.288 --> 22:38.722
try and catch up with
him before the cops do.

22:39.790 --> 22:41.525
What?

22:42.728 --> 22:44.461
Are you listening to
yourself right now?

22:44.463 --> 22:46.463
That's... that's fucking crazy.

22:46.465 --> 22:48.065
How are you even
gonna catch him?

22:48.067 --> 22:49.799
I don't know, man,
but I gotta try.

22:51.036 --> 22:52.737
I'm gonna follow
every lead I can

22:52.739 --> 22:54.270
and track that fucker down.

22:56.375 --> 22:58.375
What are you gonna
do when you find him?

23:11.155 --> 23:13.523
Jesus Christ.

23:13.526 --> 23:16.394
Tony, what the fuck are you
doing bringing that in here?

23:16.994 --> 23:18.162
Protection.

23:20.664 --> 23:23.067
Look, I know that
Charlene was your sister

23:23.068 --> 23:24.769
and that you loved her,

23:25.202 --> 23:27.704
but... this is crazy.

23:27.707 --> 23:29.038
This is fucking crazy.

23:29.040 --> 23:30.974
Crazy or not, I'm headed east.

23:33.077 --> 23:34.444
And I'm gonna kill him.

23:37.348 --> 23:40.183
Whatever you do,
you gotta leave me out of it.

23:40.185 --> 23:42.619
I don't wanna hear about it,
I don't wanna know about it,

23:42.622 --> 23:44.922
because I don't wanna have
to call the cops on you.

23:45.356 --> 23:46.824
You wouldn't do that.

23:55.366 --> 23:56.700
Just be careful.

23:58.869 --> 24:00.037
Yeah.

24:00.806 --> 24:02.105
Right.

24:14.719 --> 24:16.053
I'll see you, Ben.

24:58.998 --> 25:00.663
I'll be goddamned.

25:44.643 --> 25:46.743
They sure are
something, aren't they?

25:50.582 --> 25:51.749
They sure are.

25:53.384 --> 25:55.952
So what's the story with
these things anyway?

25:57.355 --> 26:00.257
They were built as
a western theme gas station

26:00.259 --> 26:01.892
back in the '50s.

26:01.894 --> 26:04.728
Premium Tex,
that's what they called it.

26:04.730 --> 26:07.330
Is that right?

26:07.333 --> 26:09.666
Some people have been known
to call me that same thing.

26:09.669 --> 26:12.201
So are you from Texas?

26:12.203 --> 26:14.270
Yes, ma'am, born and raised.

26:14.272 --> 26:16.440
Isn't that a coincidence.

26:17.541 --> 26:20.443
Yes, they were quite
the tourist attraction for us.

26:20.445 --> 26:21.912
Everybody came to see them.

26:22.580 --> 26:25.316
Elvis Presley dropped
by when he was in town.

26:26.550 --> 26:29.787
Now they just sort of
stand there, don't they?

26:31.021 --> 26:32.155
Almost forgotten.

26:32.891 --> 26:34.157
That is a shame.

26:34.893 --> 26:36.693
Yeah, don't I know it.

26:37.394 --> 26:40.297
You know, I've only sold
two cups of iced tea today.

26:40.731 --> 26:42.766
Say, you wouldn't wanna
buy a cup, would you?

26:42.768 --> 26:44.233
It's only 50 cents a cup,

26:44.236 --> 26:46.103
and you'd be
supporting the church.

26:46.770 --> 26:48.305
Well yes ma'am, I would.

26:48.307 --> 26:49.807
Woman: Oh that's great.

26:50.474 --> 26:52.675
Well then here you go.

26:53.310 --> 26:54.711
And it's homemade.

26:56.548 --> 26:59.750
Mm. That's mighty good.

26:59.751 --> 27:03.988
You know, my grandma used to
make iced tea just like that.

27:03.990 --> 27:05.823
Woman: That's wonderful.

27:06.557 --> 27:07.724
Keep the change.

27:07.727 --> 27:10.294
Oh, why thank you, young man.

27:10.628 --> 27:11.894
Go with god.

27:13.298 --> 27:14.632
Much obliged.

27:28.145 --> 27:30.513
Man: Hey, what are you doing?
Hey, get off the boot.

27:31.281 --> 27:33.450
Get off of there.
Come on, this is not your house.

27:33.451 --> 27:34.917
Get down from there right now.

27:34.920 --> 27:36.686
Get over here.
Get over here!

27:36.689 --> 27:37.954
What are you doing?

27:37.957 --> 27:39.789
What'd I tell you before?
Huh?

27:39.791 --> 27:42.259
Don't climb on stuff like that!
That is dangerous!

27:42.260 --> 27:44.795
Your mom is not here. I don't
wanna be responsible for that.

27:44.797 --> 27:46.529
Huh?
What do you say?

27:46.531 --> 27:47.964
You're not my dad.

27:47.967 --> 27:50.433
It doesn't matter.
You gotta respect what I say!

27:50.435 --> 27:52.135
I put a roof over
your head, right?

27:52.137 --> 27:53.403
Food on your table!

27:54.105 --> 27:55.838
Now what do you say?
Say it!

27:56.607 --> 27:57.607
I'm sorry!

27:57.609 --> 27:59.209
Say it like you mean it!

28:00.377 --> 28:01.944
- Sorry?
- -Sorry!

28:01.946 --> 28:03.480
Yeah, that's right,
you're sorry for what?

28:03.481 --> 28:04.781
Hey!
What the hell?!

28:04.784 --> 28:06.549
You gotta teach your
daughter some respect! Huh?

28:06.551 --> 28:07.718
Teach your daughter
some respect!

28:07.720 --> 28:09.053
You may touch me,

28:09.055 --> 28:11.320
but you will never lay a
hand on my daughter again!

28:11.323 --> 28:12.588
Do you hear me?

28:12.691 --> 28:15.025
I will lay a hand on
whoever I goddamn well please!

28:15.027 --> 28:16.460
You can find your own way home.

28:16.461 --> 28:17.493
Yeah, I will.

28:17.496 --> 28:18.528
I will, I'll find someone

28:18.530 --> 28:20.029
- who fucking respects me!
- Fuck you!

28:20.031 --> 28:21.632
Man: Get the fuck out of here!

28:23.000 --> 28:24.134
Goddamn!

28:42.854 --> 28:44.188
Man, fuck!

28:44.190 --> 28:45.588
Motherfucker!

28:53.530 --> 28:54.832
What the fuck do you want?!

28:55.365 --> 28:58.201
So, you like to hit little kids?

28:59.605 --> 29:01.105
Excuse me?

29:01.106 --> 29:02.239
You heard me.

29:02.240 --> 29:03.539
Yeah well I don't think

29:03.541 --> 29:05.476
it's any of your
fucking business, dude!

29:06.411 --> 29:09.179
My daddy wore a pair of
boots same color as these

29:09.181 --> 29:10.780
when he used to kick my ass.

29:11.516 --> 29:13.951
Matter of fact, he shattered
my jaw once with one.

29:14.451 --> 29:17.221
Ah yeah? Why don't you
get the fuck out of here

29:17.222 --> 29:19.623
before I fracture that
shit again, bitch?!

29:37.541 --> 29:39.809
Honey, I think we need
to go back and get him.

29:39.811 --> 29:41.811
- I just wanna go home!
- No, honey, it's okay.

29:41.814 --> 29:43.646
You know how he can be, right?

29:43.648 --> 29:45.782
Come on, please.
Come on, baby, okay?

30:18.416 --> 30:20.183
Oh god!
Oh god!

31:17.342 --> 31:19.209
- Howdy.
- Hi.

31:21.311 --> 31:23.247
Sure is a hot one
out there, ain't it?

31:23.580 --> 31:24.882
Sure is.

31:26.217 --> 31:27.917
All that driving
made me thirsty.

31:28.720 --> 31:30.354
You been on the road for long?

31:30.355 --> 31:31.788
Sure have.

31:32.557 --> 31:34.124
I'll be needing some gas too.

31:35.058 --> 31:36.326
$15 worth.

31:37.729 --> 31:40.230
All right, that'll
be $16.89 altogether.

31:40.865 --> 31:42.499
Oh I can't break that.

31:44.669 --> 31:45.736
You can't break that?

31:46.270 --> 31:47.738
No, the mister went to the bank

31:47.740 --> 31:49.940
and he only left me with
a little bit of change.

31:49.942 --> 31:51.240
I don't have enough.

31:52.076 --> 31:53.477
Well that's all I have.

31:55.947 --> 31:57.780
Well can't you
buy some more gas?

31:58.583 --> 32:00.083
I don't need more gas.

32:02.619 --> 32:05.321
How about you buy
a couple cases of this juice?

32:07.925 --> 32:09.292
I ain't that thirsty.

32:13.263 --> 32:16.199
Well, I'm sorry, mister,
but I can't break it.

32:20.270 --> 32:22.439
You're telling me you
run a gas station here

32:23.473 --> 32:27.310
and I come in for some gas
and you won't sell it to me?

32:31.548 --> 32:33.383
What kind of business
are you running here?

32:36.421 --> 32:39.256
There ain't nothing wrong
with my business, pal,

32:39.258 --> 32:42.224
unless you think the business
I'm running is a bank,

32:42.227 --> 32:45.394
in which case that makes
you either blind or stupid.

32:50.134 --> 32:51.567
What'd you say to me?

32:52.903 --> 32:54.471
You heard me, buddy.

32:54.472 --> 32:56.239
I speak pretty clearly.

32:58.742 --> 33:00.242
I ain't your buddy,

33:01.179 --> 33:02.846
and you ain't pretty.

33:08.353 --> 33:10.753
I have a low tolerance
for people like you,

33:12.490 --> 33:14.391
people who think
they can walk around

33:15.759 --> 33:17.361
talking to people like that,

33:18.628 --> 33:20.564
like they're smarter
than everyone,

33:21.798 --> 33:23.333
like they know everything.

33:25.002 --> 33:28.337
All I know is I want you
out of my station right now

33:28.673 --> 33:31.375
before my husband comes
in and takes you out.

33:33.845 --> 33:35.378
Do you think that scares me?

33:37.548 --> 33:39.281
You know what I could do to you

33:39.951 --> 33:41.284
before he gets back?

33:44.055 --> 33:45.355
Just leave.

33:49.559 --> 33:51.694
Why don't you give
me one good reason

33:51.697 --> 33:54.397
why I shouldn't gut you
like a fish right here?

34:01.905 --> 34:04.875
Because my baby girl's sleeping
right there behind the counter

34:04.876 --> 34:06.410
and you'd wake her up.

35:24.789 --> 35:25.789
Hi there.

35:25.791 --> 35:28.858
Oh. Well hello, young man.

35:30.728 --> 35:33.230
- How much for a cup of iced tea?
- 50 cents.

35:33.898 --> 35:35.398
- Sounds good.
- Great.

35:35.400 --> 35:37.300
- I'll take one.
- Great, great.

35:37.768 --> 35:39.668
- There you go.
- Tony: Thank you.

35:39.670 --> 35:41.403
Thanks. Oh, thank you.

35:44.074 --> 35:45.074
Say...

35:45.909 --> 35:48.378
This the place where a man
was killed a few weeks back?

35:50.648 --> 35:51.847
It was.

35:53.284 --> 35:54.518
You here when it happened?

35:55.152 --> 35:56.353
I was here.

35:56.820 --> 35:57.987
Who are you?

35:57.989 --> 35:59.588
Oh, no one.

36:00.858 --> 36:02.324
Just curious is all.

36:03.960 --> 36:07.329
Did you happen to catch a
glimpse of the guy who did it?

36:07.331 --> 36:10.132
Look, I told everything
I saw to the police.

36:10.135 --> 36:11.268
Tony: I know.

36:11.835 --> 36:13.269
I'm sorry, I'm not the police.

36:14.204 --> 36:15.704
I just have a...

36:16.840 --> 36:18.340
Personal connection to him.

36:20.043 --> 36:21.043
Did you see him?

36:24.382 --> 36:28.284
Well, there was a man that
bought an iced tea from me

36:28.286 --> 36:30.052
before anything happened,

36:30.054 --> 36:32.222
and, well, then he was gone

36:32.224 --> 36:34.224
when we found that poor man...

36:35.025 --> 36:36.358
All cut up.

36:37.460 --> 36:38.695
What'd he look like?

36:39.996 --> 36:41.197
He looked awful.

36:41.199 --> 36:43.333
He'd been stabbed, I don't know,
two dozen times.

36:43.335 --> 36:46.202
No no no no no no,
the man you saw beforehand.

36:46.836 --> 36:49.438
Oh. Oh...

36:50.373 --> 36:51.875
Yeah. Um...

36:51.876 --> 36:54.945
He had brown hair.
It was slicked back.

36:55.378 --> 36:57.447
Um... 30.

36:57.882 --> 36:59.048
He was handsome.

36:59.750 --> 37:02.585
He had on a brown
leather jacket,

37:02.588 --> 37:04.820
and he had a really nice smile.

37:05.822 --> 37:08.391
He bought some iced
tea and then just left.

37:09.360 --> 37:10.793
Did you see his car?

37:12.262 --> 37:14.931
Yes, yes. It was orange.

37:14.932 --> 37:16.432
It sort of looked
like a pumpkin.

37:19.003 --> 37:20.103
Okay.

37:21.739 --> 37:24.507
Thanks for your time
and for the tea.

37:24.509 --> 37:26.443
Oh, sure.

37:26.445 --> 37:27.777
Sorry I bothered you.

37:27.778 --> 37:30.679
Oh, no bother at all.
Go with god.

37:31.414 --> 37:32.581
I will.

39:07.143 --> 39:08.545
What can I get you?

39:09.280 --> 39:11.981
A large popcorn, extra butter,
and a large coke.

39:11.983 --> 39:13.416
You got it.

39:20.557 --> 39:21.958
Are you in line?

39:24.228 --> 39:25.795
Yes, ma'am.

39:25.797 --> 39:27.429
Oh, okay. Just checking.

39:29.367 --> 39:31.134
You enjoying the movie so far?

39:32.202 --> 39:34.304
Um... it's okay.

39:34.306 --> 39:36.639
Turns out it's not that fun
to watch a scary movie

39:36.641 --> 39:39.376
at the drive-in theater...
By yourself.

39:40.710 --> 39:42.411
You could say that again.

39:42.414 --> 39:43.813
I'm flying solo myself.

39:46.650 --> 39:47.916
$6.75.

39:52.523 --> 39:53.922
Keep the change.

39:56.092 --> 39:58.762
Well... it was nice meeting you.

40:00.097 --> 40:01.498
Lila.

40:01.500 --> 40:02.632
Man: Lila.

40:03.000 --> 40:04.567
That is a beautiful name.

40:06.936 --> 40:08.304
What's yours?

40:09.907 --> 40:11.106
Justin.

40:11.608 --> 40:12.742
Well...

40:13.744 --> 40:14.911
Justin...

40:18.349 --> 40:20.182
What do you say we
watch the movie together

40:20.184 --> 40:21.483
after I grab my drink?

40:24.387 --> 40:26.021
Sounds real nice.

40:27.056 --> 40:28.291
Are you...

40:29.092 --> 40:31.094
Sure you wanna watch a movie
with a stranger?

40:32.396 --> 40:33.963
You look harmless enough.

40:35.599 --> 40:37.534
Besides, my car's
just right there.

40:40.137 --> 40:42.438
Fair enough. Let's go.

40:44.809 --> 40:48.510
<i>There's more than one
way to skin a cat, right?</i>

40:50.047 --> 40:51.514
<i>- Right.
- Right.</i>

41:02.793 --> 41:05.061
So, do you come here often?

41:06.463 --> 41:09.632
Probably more than I should.
I... I love movies.

41:11.501 --> 41:14.503
My dad used to take me to
the drive-in when I was a kid.

41:15.105 --> 41:17.039
Took me to see
some real classics.

41:18.442 --> 41:20.809
Probably the nicest thing
that bastard ever did for me.

41:23.079 --> 41:24.914
The movies were
better then anyways.

41:24.916 --> 41:26.483
That's for sure.

41:28.918 --> 41:31.019
I used to go to the
movies with my parents

41:31.021 --> 41:32.588
when I was a little girl too.

41:33.324 --> 41:36.659
That's when I decided I
wanted to be an actress.

41:37.661 --> 41:40.663
- Justin: An actress, huh?
- Yep.

41:40.664 --> 41:43.032
Man in the movie: <i> You bitch!</i>

41:49.539 --> 41:52.007
I dreamed about
going to Hollywood

41:52.010 --> 41:54.043
and being a big famous star.

41:56.480 --> 41:57.914
Well, did you go?

41:59.182 --> 42:01.518
No. I stayed here.

42:04.655 --> 42:07.489
But I took some drama classes
and...

42:08.659 --> 42:09.759
Did a few plays.

42:09.760 --> 42:13.695
I even got an agent, to do
some modeling work for a while.

42:14.164 --> 42:16.465
But... I gave all that up.

42:18.969 --> 42:20.402
<i>Stop it!</i>

42:20.405 --> 42:21.538
Why?

42:26.677 --> 42:29.112
It's too hard to make a living
in that business.

42:30.047 --> 42:31.581
It's a constant struggle.

42:32.181 --> 42:33.916
All that competition, I just...

42:34.585 --> 42:35.784
I couldn't handle it.

42:37.186 --> 42:38.420
So you quit.

42:42.192 --> 42:43.425
My parents...

42:44.394 --> 42:46.262
They didn't want
me to keep at it.

42:47.264 --> 42:50.400
They told me it
wasn't a real job, so...

42:50.934 --> 42:52.101
They made me quit.

42:53.170 --> 42:55.003
Made me get a normal job,

42:55.672 --> 42:56.806
a boring job,

42:58.175 --> 43:00.376
said as long as I was
underneath their roof,

43:00.378 --> 43:03.512
I had to obey their rules, so...

43:04.248 --> 43:05.648
Well, you could've left.

43:07.050 --> 43:08.483
I didn't have any money.

43:09.753 --> 43:11.186
What was I gonna do?

43:11.188 --> 43:13.356
Hitchhike and go all the
way down to Hollywood

43:13.358 --> 43:15.557
and get killed by some psycho?

43:15.559 --> 43:17.927
Not me.

43:27.972 --> 43:29.472
When I left home...

43:30.907 --> 43:32.608
I didn't know where
I was going either.

43:34.110 --> 43:35.844
I just knew what
I was looking for.

43:39.750 --> 43:41.351
It hasn't steered me wrong yet.

43:46.222 --> 43:48.123
Have you found what
you're looking for?

43:49.126 --> 43:50.293
Not yet...

43:51.661 --> 43:53.528
Not who I'm looking for anyway.

43:58.434 --> 44:00.335
Do you like who
you're looking at now?

44:01.972 --> 44:03.172
I sure do.

44:08.012 --> 44:09.711
Would you like to kiss me?

44:10.514 --> 44:11.914
I think I would.

44:23.494 --> 44:24.693
Wow.

44:31.768 --> 44:33.369
My car's down front.

44:33.804 --> 44:36.204
Have a better view of the movie
and a much...

44:37.273 --> 44:38.708
Much bigger backseat.

44:39.108 --> 44:41.077
- All right.
- Justin: Yeah.

44:42.478 --> 44:44.847
Well, lead the way.

44:54.557 --> 44:56.125
<i>Wanna meet me someplace?</i>

44:56.827 --> 44:58.027
<i>Where?</i>

44:59.028 --> 45:00.463
<i>The backseat.</i>

45:03.132 --> 45:04.534
Woman in movie: <i> Sure.</i>

45:15.813 --> 45:18.581
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa,
slow down, cowboy.

45:19.215 --> 45:20.916
Just going a little too fast.

45:21.751 --> 45:22.918
Am I?

45:23.320 --> 45:26.289
Yeah. Let's just slow
down a little, okay.

45:26.657 --> 45:28.056
This shirt stays on tonight.

45:29.025 --> 45:31.059
I'd like it better
if it was off.

45:33.864 --> 45:35.297
All you men say that.

45:35.666 --> 45:38.134
Wanna move too fast the minute
you get me in your backseat.

45:39.369 --> 45:41.403
Don't say that.

45:43.172 --> 45:44.907
I'm not like all other men,

45:46.009 --> 45:47.643
not the ones you've been with.

45:55.418 --> 45:56.753
Just relax, okay.

45:56.755 --> 45:59.489
Just... just keep doing
what you're doing. Come on.

46:03.260 --> 46:04.927
I have a better idea.

46:07.097 --> 46:08.431
Let's play a game.

46:11.201 --> 46:12.934
A game? What game?

46:15.038 --> 46:16.606
Let's pretend we're in a movie.

46:18.909 --> 46:20.309
What kind of movie?

46:22.411 --> 46:23.813
A scary movie.

46:28.217 --> 46:30.152
I don't really
like scary movies.

46:32.755 --> 46:34.123
But you're an actress.

46:35.092 --> 46:36.992
A good actress
can play any part.

46:37.760 --> 46:39.061
That's her job.

46:41.731 --> 46:43.666
So... what's my part?

46:46.269 --> 46:47.637
You're a girl...

46:48.771 --> 46:50.572
Who likes to go to the drive-in

46:51.275 --> 46:53.175
all by herself,

46:55.411 --> 46:57.179
looking for the perfect man...

46:58.248 --> 47:00.248
That's gonna sweep
her off her feet

47:01.117 --> 47:03.219
and give her a free
ride to Hollywood.

47:08.759 --> 47:10.659
But she chooses the wrong one,

47:11.929 --> 47:15.597
and she gets her
pretty little face

47:16.333 --> 47:17.733
all cut up,

47:18.802 --> 47:20.436
so she'll never be on TV,

47:22.271 --> 47:24.306
except maybe the 5:00 news.

47:31.447 --> 47:33.282
That's who you are.

49:31.969 --> 49:33.835
Radio news:
<i>It's 3:00 here at KRFM,</i>

49:33.838 --> 49:36.237
<i>so it's time for
your afternoon news.</i>

49:36.239 --> 49:37.572
<i>The car of Lila Davis,</i>

<i>A clerk at the theater

49:52.690 --> 49:55.023

50:27.291 --> 50:30.291
<i>In other news, our recent

50:59.489 --> 51:00.588
Hello?

51:01.590 --> 51:04.460
Hey, man.
How's it going out there?

51:05.394 --> 51:06.661
He did it again.

51:07.764 --> 51:08.998
What?

51:09.699 --> 51:10.766
Where?

51:10.768 --> 51:13.168
Picked up a girl
at a local drive-in

51:13.170 --> 51:15.637
and just dumped her
body in a ditch nearby.

51:17.740 --> 51:18.907
Jesus.

51:20.510 --> 51:22.911
I'm close to him, man.
I can feel it.

51:25.782 --> 51:28.516
Man,
you should just come on home.

51:29.286 --> 51:31.387
Don't get close to him.
It isn't worth it.

51:31.389 --> 51:33.588
<i>- I don't want you to get hurt.</i>
- I don't either,

51:34.190 --> 51:37.092
but I ain't coming back home,
not yet.

51:37.760 --> 51:39.027
What are you gonna do,

51:39.030 --> 51:41.262
just drive around
until you find him?

51:41.264 --> 51:42.697
Tony: <i> That's all I can do,</i>

51:43.199 --> 51:45.601
but I know what his
car looks like now.

51:45.603 --> 51:48.804
I'm gonna check all the local
bars, restaurants, clubs,

51:48.806 --> 51:50.940
any place he might
try to pick up a girl.

51:54.143 --> 51:56.644
Tony, please, man, just...

51:57.614 --> 51:59.248
Don't do anything stupid.

51:59.250 --> 52:00.949
Come home,

52:01.650 --> 52:04.018
or tell me where you're
at and I'll come find you.

52:06.822 --> 52:09.190
So long, Ben.
Thanks for the call.

52:14.764 --> 52:15.898
Fuck.

52:18.235 --> 52:19.335
Fuck!

52:46.329 --> 52:49.398
Hey boss, how about some more
of that sauce over here?

52:51.201 --> 52:52.400
You like that, huh?

52:54.103 --> 52:56.438
That is the best
goddamn sauce I ever had.

52:56.840 --> 52:57.940
Spicy too.

52:59.041 --> 53:00.876
Yeah, we don't screw around
around here.

53:00.878 --> 53:02.010
I'll get you some more.

53:02.012 --> 53:03.378
Thank you kindly.

54:30.132 --> 54:31.500
What can I get you?

54:32.635 --> 54:33.936
I'll take a beer.

54:48.485 --> 54:49.684
Be three bucks.

55:10.673 --> 55:11.840
Cheers.

55:12.976 --> 55:16.244
I'd cheers you, partner,
but I'm... drinking a coke.

55:17.012 --> 55:18.347
That'd be bad luck.

55:19.983 --> 55:21.150
Sure.

55:23.152 --> 55:24.219
Bad luck.

55:26.021 --> 55:28.356
But good on you anyway.

55:35.699 --> 55:36.764
Say,

55:37.867 --> 55:39.835
haven't I seen you
somewhere before?

55:41.438 --> 55:42.704
Not likely.

55:43.472 --> 55:44.672
Sure I have.

55:45.275 --> 55:46.375
You see...

55:49.679 --> 55:51.347
I never forget a face.

55:53.148 --> 55:54.516
Dwayne: Is that right?

55:58.655 --> 56:00.121
Well, neither do I.

56:02.057 --> 56:05.527
Dale's tavern, wasn't it,
about a month back?

56:07.063 --> 56:08.597
Yeah, it could've been?

56:10.233 --> 56:11.367
Yeah.

56:12.402 --> 56:13.969
I think that's right.

56:15.204 --> 56:18.440
You... took my sister,
Charlene, out back.

56:20.677 --> 56:21.909
Remember?

56:23.579 --> 56:26.047
What kind of game are
you trying to play here?

56:29.853 --> 56:31.420
Oh, I ain't playing no game.

56:35.557 --> 56:37.192
Now, if you're
trying to scare me,

56:37.193 --> 56:39.061
you're gonna have to
do better than that.

56:40.329 --> 56:42.063
You killed my sister.

56:44.934 --> 56:46.135
Did I?

56:47.070 --> 56:49.438
Then why don't you kill me?

56:49.873 --> 56:51.106
Oh, I will,

56:52.108 --> 56:53.409
but not here.

56:53.411 --> 56:56.077
Why? Don't have the <i> cojones?</i>

56:56.079 --> 56:58.179
Don't wanna make a
mess all over this bar.

57:04.686 --> 57:05.853
Listen.

57:07.456 --> 57:09.657
Let's you and me go
for a little ride, huh?

57:10.393 --> 57:11.693
Sure.

57:11.695 --> 57:14.195
You seem like a guy who
likes to have a good time.

57:14.197 --> 57:15.797
Shut the fuck up.

57:16.599 --> 57:18.032
Pay your tab

57:18.601 --> 57:20.601
and walk nice and slow outside

57:20.603 --> 57:23.005
or I will make a mess
all over this bar.

57:27.143 --> 57:28.876
Is everything all
right over here?

57:29.711 --> 57:30.978
Yeah.

57:30.981 --> 57:32.981
My friend and I are
gonna go for a drive,

57:32.983 --> 57:34.817
so I'd like to settle up my tab.

57:35.617 --> 57:37.018
That'll be $6.

57:38.987 --> 57:41.289
Well, pay the man.

57:50.400 --> 57:51.632
You need change with that?

57:56.072 --> 57:57.338
Let's go, buddy.

58:18.862 --> 58:20.195
You drive.

58:20.197 --> 58:21.362
Sure thing.

58:22.331 --> 58:23.798
Saddle up, partner.

58:23.800 --> 58:25.666
And don't do anything stupid

58:26.503 --> 58:28.469
or I'll blow your
head clean off.

58:28.472 --> 58:30.338
Sure you will.

58:40.682 --> 58:43.085
So, where to, hoss?

58:44.487 --> 58:46.355
Just get back on the highway

58:46.356 --> 58:48.023
and don't do a goddamn
thing otherwise

58:48.025 --> 58:49.625
until I tell you to.

58:51.126 --> 58:52.460
Whatever you say.

58:52.829 --> 58:54.396
Onward and upward.

59:05.407 --> 59:07.809
You had better not
be fucking with me.

59:08.744 --> 59:10.846
The engine on old pumpkin here

59:10.847 --> 59:12.748
ain't what she used to be.

59:13.849 --> 59:15.983
You just gotta give her
a minute to warm up,

59:17.052 --> 59:19.054
run your hands across her,

59:19.822 --> 59:23.458
and then she'll do exactly
what you want her to do,

59:24.860 --> 59:26.427
just like most women.

59:27.429 --> 59:30.132
You got one more shot at
getting that car started

59:30.733 --> 59:32.934
or I'm gonna start taking shots.
You understand?

59:37.608 --> 59:40.141
See, just like I said.

59:41.577 --> 59:42.844
Works every time.

01:00:08.704 --> 01:00:11.373
You know, I never did carry
one of those things.

01:00:13.208 --> 01:00:14.543
Why is that?

01:00:15.545 --> 01:00:16.777
Too passive.

01:00:17.614 --> 01:00:19.547
For sissies who don't want
to put any effort

01:00:19.550 --> 01:00:20.983
into what they're doing.

01:00:20.985 --> 01:00:22.317
Too clean.

01:00:23.052 --> 01:00:24.152
Right.

01:00:24.153 --> 01:00:27.655
You just prefer cutting pretty
girls open with a knife.

01:00:28.657 --> 01:00:30.358
Taking their insides out.

01:00:32.161 --> 01:00:33.795
You know a lot, don't you?

01:00:33.797 --> 01:00:35.563
Tony: I know
how I found my sister.

01:00:37.333 --> 01:00:39.300
She wasn't the first, was she?

01:00:40.469 --> 01:00:41.969
Won't be the last either.

01:00:41.972 --> 01:00:43.472
Tony: See that's
where you're wrong.

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:46.541
You're not gonna hurt
anyone ever again.

01:00:49.244 --> 01:00:51.012
You sound real sure of yourself.

01:00:51.780 --> 01:00:54.483
Shut up and keep driving
until I tell you otherwise.

01:00:56.652 --> 01:00:59.521
You know, you still haven't told
me where I'm going yet.

01:01:00.422 --> 01:01:02.324
You'll find out soon enough.

01:01:04.193 --> 01:01:05.860
The suspense is killing me.

01:01:57.547 --> 01:01:59.047
Turn the engine off.

01:02:13.028 --> 01:02:14.262
So what now?

01:02:17.065 --> 01:02:19.434
I bet you killed a lot
of girls in this car.

01:02:22.672 --> 01:02:23.905
In this car?

01:02:26.074 --> 01:02:27.675
Matter of fact...

01:02:29.344 --> 01:02:31.646
I killed one sitting
right where you are now.

01:02:33.916 --> 01:02:35.583
Goddamn did she scream.

01:02:37.686 --> 01:02:40.454
The leather seats make it
real easy to clean up though.

01:02:43.025 --> 01:02:45.594
I'm always real careful
to clean up afterwards

01:02:48.563 --> 01:02:51.932
alright, you sick motherfucker,
out of the car!

01:02:51.934 --> 01:02:52.967
Out!

01:02:52.969 --> 01:02:55.536
All right.
All right.

01:03:15.257 --> 01:03:16.791
I'm gonna end this,

01:03:18.161 --> 01:03:19.561
end you.

01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:22.396
Is that right?

01:03:25.134 --> 01:03:26.367
Before I do,

01:03:28.670 --> 01:03:30.639
I just gotta ask you one thing.

01:03:33.009 --> 01:03:34.208
Shoot.

01:03:38.481 --> 01:03:39.648
Why?

01:03:43.119 --> 01:03:44.219
Why?

01:03:45.987 --> 01:03:47.489
You wanna know why.

01:03:51.994 --> 01:03:53.094
All right.

01:03:54.496 --> 01:03:55.864
I'll tell you why.

01:04:28.864 --> 01:04:31.599
Because some people don't
deserve to go on living.

01:04:42.811 --> 01:04:45.447
You should've stopped talking
about what you wanted to do

01:04:46.414 --> 01:04:47.748
and done it.

01:07:31.246 --> 01:07:32.646
What's going on out here?

01:07:37.719 --> 01:07:39.586
Sorry, I didn't
mean to wake you up.

01:07:40.389 --> 01:07:41.556
Dwayne: You didn't.

01:07:42.490 --> 01:07:43.824
I just heard you crying

01:07:43.827 --> 01:07:45.927
and wanted to see what all
the commotion was about.

01:07:47.496 --> 01:07:48.963
It's a long story.

01:07:49.731 --> 01:07:51.865
Short version is I'm
locked out of my room

01:07:51.867 --> 01:07:54.302
and have no idea how
I'm gonna pay for it.

01:08:03.278 --> 01:08:04.746
Give me the long version.

01:08:06.047 --> 01:08:07.347
I got time.

01:08:09.552 --> 01:08:11.085
You sure about that?

01:08:12.554 --> 01:08:13.954
Sure I'm sure.

01:08:16.926 --> 01:08:18.091
Well...

01:08:19.795 --> 01:08:22.997
The asshole I was staying with
split town and left me here.

01:08:23.932 --> 01:08:26.167
He hit me and took
all the money,

01:08:26.734 --> 01:08:28.103
my money.

01:08:31.907 --> 01:08:33.006
How much?

01:08:33.774 --> 01:08:34.975
Enough.

01:08:38.881 --> 01:08:40.381
Why'd he take it?

01:08:41.317 --> 01:08:43.251
Because he's
a mean son of a bitch,

01:08:43.252 --> 01:08:45.819
thinks he's hot shit,
thinks he owns me.

01:08:46.453 --> 01:08:48.189
Without me
he wouldn't have a dime.

01:08:51.894 --> 01:08:53.493
What kind of work do you do?

01:08:59.435 --> 01:09:00.801
You'll judge me.

01:09:02.337 --> 01:09:03.671
I won't judge you.

01:09:12.014 --> 01:09:13.381
I'm a dancer.

01:09:15.117 --> 01:09:16.684
What kind of dancer?

01:09:18.685 --> 01:09:20.386
The kind who takes
their clothes off.

01:09:22.256 --> 01:09:23.423
Dwayne: I see.

01:09:24.658 --> 01:09:26.161
Does that bother you?

01:09:27.462 --> 01:09:29.095
I ain't easily bothered.

01:09:32.701 --> 01:09:35.368
We were in town so I
could dance at this club.

01:09:35.372 --> 01:09:38.238
He's been, like my manager
for the last year,

01:09:38.841 --> 01:09:40.640
and he just ups and leaves,

01:09:40.644 --> 01:09:42.542
everything I've been
working for.

01:09:42.944 --> 01:09:45.779
Me, I've been working that
whole time, saving up.

01:09:47.682 --> 01:09:48.881
For what?

01:09:50.853 --> 01:09:52.051
A dream.

01:09:53.956 --> 01:09:55.289
Well what dream?

01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:01.729
I've been planning on
opening a beauty salon.

01:10:02.965 --> 01:10:04.966
Wouldn't know it by
looking at me I know,

01:10:04.967 --> 01:10:07.702
but it's been a dream of mine
since I was a little girl.

01:10:10.372 --> 01:10:12.140
It's good to have dreams,

01:10:13.175 --> 01:10:14.442
to work for them.

01:10:15.911 --> 01:10:17.779
Yeah. Well...

01:10:19.247 --> 01:10:22.050
It's all gone now,
along with that money.

01:10:22.585 --> 01:10:24.085
Dwayne: Don't talk like that.

01:10:26.188 --> 01:10:28.922
There's always a way,
if you work for it.

01:10:30.993 --> 01:10:32.260
How can I say that

01:10:32.261 --> 01:10:34.395
when I can't even pay
for my own damn room?

01:10:34.396 --> 01:10:36.331
I haven't got
a goddamn cent on me.

01:10:45.274 --> 01:10:46.474
I'll tell you what.

01:10:47.443 --> 01:10:49.010
You stay with me tonight.

01:10:49.712 --> 01:10:52.313
You can even have the bed,
and I'll sleep on the floor.

01:10:53.282 --> 01:10:56.917
And in the morning we'll...
Figure out your situation.

01:10:59.721 --> 01:11:01.588
No, I couldn't put
you out like that.

01:11:02.925 --> 01:11:04.492
It ain't putting anyone out.

01:11:05.461 --> 01:11:06.961
I'd be glad to help.

01:11:08.029 --> 01:11:10.465
Plus the floor ain't
much less comfortable

01:11:10.466 --> 01:11:12.100
than the bed anyhow.

01:11:13.402 --> 01:11:14.836
And I'll be a gentleman,

01:11:15.304 --> 01:11:16.537
scout's honor.

01:11:19.707 --> 01:11:20.942
You sure?

01:11:22.478 --> 01:11:24.177
I ain't gonna offer again.

01:11:28.751 --> 01:11:30.717
Yeah. Okay.

01:11:31.220 --> 01:11:32.453
Thanks.

01:11:32.454 --> 01:11:33.720
Dwayne: Don't mention it.

01:11:34.155 --> 01:11:35.323
Come on.

01:11:52.507 --> 01:11:54.007
It ain't exactly the Ritz,

01:11:54.010 --> 01:11:57.078
but the bed's clean and I
don't have cooties or nothing.

01:11:57.979 --> 01:11:59.314
Good to know.

01:12:03.918 --> 01:12:05.353
Make yourself at home.

01:12:19.435 --> 01:12:21.502
That can't be comfortable.

01:12:22.438 --> 01:12:24.538
I'm just as fine
here as I am anywhere,

01:12:24.541 --> 01:12:25.739
believe me.

01:12:29.511 --> 01:12:31.279
So, what about you?

01:12:33.047 --> 01:12:34.515
What about me?

01:12:34.983 --> 01:12:36.884
What were you doing
in this shitty motel?

01:12:40.555 --> 01:12:42.256
It's where I feel comfortable.

01:12:43.658 --> 01:12:45.092
You traveling?

01:12:45.793 --> 01:12:47.127
Dwayne: You could say that.

01:12:48.697 --> 01:12:51.298
I'm always traveling, drifting.

01:12:52.734 --> 01:12:55.069
Never really felt at
home in any one place.

01:12:56.537 --> 01:12:57.704
Me either.

01:12:59.207 --> 01:13:01.408
So I figure I'll
just keep on drifting

01:13:01.844 --> 01:13:03.944
until I find something
that makes me wanna stop,

01:13:04.813 --> 01:13:06.079
know what I mean?

01:13:06.715 --> 01:13:08.082
Yeah, I think I do.

01:13:08.083 --> 01:13:09.817
Maybe that's what I should do.

01:13:09.819 --> 01:13:12.252
What you should do is
open up that beauty salon.

01:13:12.255 --> 01:13:13.755
That's what you should do.

01:13:14.256 --> 01:13:16.423
Yeah, someday.

01:13:16.759 --> 01:13:18.126
Yeah, you'll do it.

01:13:18.894 --> 01:13:20.627
You just gotta keep motoring on.

01:13:22.264 --> 01:13:23.898
You know what your destiny is.

01:13:25.734 --> 01:13:29.069
You just gotta keep moving
forward and you'll get there.

01:13:31.340 --> 01:13:32.774
Nothing's gonna stop you,

01:13:33.442 --> 01:13:34.742
no one.

01:13:36.444 --> 01:13:38.011
No one's ever stopped me.

01:13:40.548 --> 01:13:41.916
What's your destiny?

01:13:46.454 --> 01:13:48.655
I don't think I can
tell you that just yet.

01:13:49.524 --> 01:13:50.591
Why not?

01:13:52.761 --> 01:13:54.261
I don't have the answer.

01:13:55.898 --> 01:13:56.997
Not yet.

01:14:00.068 --> 01:14:01.469
I'm getting closer.

01:14:02.537 --> 01:14:04.271
Will you tell me
when you do know?

01:14:05.106 --> 01:14:06.340
Sure I will.

01:14:08.076 --> 01:14:10.144
I'm still trying to figure out
what mine is.

01:14:14.315 --> 01:14:16.216
You look like a
girl I once knew.

01:14:16.819 --> 01:14:18.286
Roxy: Oh yeah, who's that?

01:14:19.654 --> 01:14:20.822
Carol Ann.

01:14:22.957 --> 01:14:24.625
A girl I almost married.

01:14:27.895 --> 01:14:29.630
She had hair just like yours.

01:14:30.798 --> 01:14:33.400
This thing?

01:14:34.970 --> 01:14:36.369
I just wear it for work.

01:14:36.904 --> 01:14:38.872
Most men have
a thing for blondes.

01:14:40.141 --> 01:14:41.341
Yeah.

01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:48.181
So... what happened?

01:14:50.118 --> 01:14:51.351
What?

01:14:51.787 --> 01:14:53.087
Roxy: What happened?

01:14:53.689 --> 01:14:56.189
- To what?
- The girl you were gonna marry.

01:15:00.828 --> 01:15:02.162
She broke my heart.

01:15:04.966 --> 01:15:06.033
Sorry.

01:15:08.136 --> 01:15:09.403
It's all right.

01:15:10.872 --> 01:15:12.573
She got what she deserved.

01:15:15.676 --> 01:15:16.777
And so did I.

01:15:22.216 --> 01:15:23.917
I don't think I
caught your name.

01:15:25.052 --> 01:15:27.421
Roxy. What's yours?

01:15:27.855 --> 01:15:29.055
Dwayne.

01:15:29.057 --> 01:15:31.158
Dwayne. I like that.

01:15:31.159 --> 01:15:32.726
Sounds like a rock
and roll singer.

01:15:35.396 --> 01:15:37.765
You don't wanna hear
me sing, that's for sure.

01:15:38.399 --> 01:15:40.167
Bust every window
out of this joint.

01:15:40.168 --> 01:15:43.703
All right, I'll
take your word for it.

01:15:47.743 --> 01:15:49.143
Well you must be tired.

01:15:50.511 --> 01:15:51.912
I'll let you rest.

01:16:09.597 --> 01:16:12.132
Thanks again for helping me out.

01:16:13.201 --> 01:16:14.635
It's no trouble.

01:16:15.337 --> 01:16:17.637
You just get some sleep
and we'll talk in the morning.

01:16:21.409 --> 01:16:22.609
Night, Dwayne.

01:16:23.377 --> 01:16:24.744
Goodnight, Roxy.

01:17:14.328 --> 01:17:15.496
Morning.

01:17:16.497 --> 01:17:17.564
Morning.

01:17:19.067 --> 01:17:20.301
How'd you sleep?

01:17:21.670 --> 01:17:23.337
Like the dead.

01:17:25.841 --> 01:17:27.073
Good.

01:17:28.176 --> 01:17:29.377
You?

01:17:31.345 --> 01:17:32.813
I don't sleep much.

01:17:34.448 --> 01:17:35.582
Oh.

01:17:39.154 --> 01:17:40.520
I was thinking.

01:17:41.288 --> 01:17:42.689
Roxy: About what?

01:17:43.257 --> 01:17:44.492
That guy.

01:17:45.627 --> 01:17:47.228
Took all that money from you.

01:17:48.462 --> 01:17:49.596
Yeah.

01:17:50.865 --> 01:17:52.332
What's his name?

01:17:54.368 --> 01:17:55.502
Sug.

01:17:56.805 --> 01:17:57.938
Sug what?

01:17:59.841 --> 01:18:01.207
Sug white.

01:18:01.810 --> 01:18:03.043
Sug white?

01:18:05.881 --> 01:18:07.213
That's what he goes by.

01:18:07.216 --> 01:18:09.082
I don't know what
his real name is.

01:18:09.650 --> 01:18:12.185
You got any idea where Sug
might've ran off to?

01:18:14.122 --> 01:18:16.189
- Pretty good one.

01:18:16.192 --> 01:18:17.192
Where?

01:18:19.060 --> 01:18:21.395
He has this big house in
the suburbs where he stays

01:18:21.396 --> 01:18:23.396
with some of his people.

01:18:24.365 --> 01:18:25.599
Where is it?

01:18:26.501 --> 01:18:28.402
It's a couple hours from here.

01:18:28.404 --> 01:18:31.439
That's why we were staying
here while I was... working.

01:18:34.576 --> 01:18:36.310
And you're really sure
he's there?

01:18:37.979 --> 01:18:40.381
I don't know, but I bet he is.

01:18:40.815 --> 01:18:42.649
He knows I can't go back there.

01:18:42.652 --> 01:18:44.784
Kick my ass if I ever
showed up there again.

01:18:47.922 --> 01:18:49.622
You're not gonna show up there.

01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:53.094
What do you mean?

01:18:54.996 --> 01:18:56.262
I am.

01:18:58.934 --> 01:19:00.467
Why?

01:19:01.069 --> 01:19:02.235
Well...

01:19:02.938 --> 01:19:04.805
When someone takes what's yours,

01:19:05.506 --> 01:19:07.173
you have a right to get it back.

01:19:10.244 --> 01:19:11.746
But how would you do it?

01:19:12.780 --> 01:19:14.247
Let me worry about that.

01:19:14.615 --> 01:19:16.317
You just tell me
how to get there.

01:19:17.786 --> 01:19:19.353
I won't let them hurt you.

01:19:20.255 --> 01:19:21.689
They won't even
know you're there.

01:19:26.027 --> 01:19:27.360
I don't know.

01:19:28.529 --> 01:19:30.797
You still wanna open up
that beauty salon, don't you?

01:19:33.368 --> 01:19:34.534
Yeah.

01:19:35.069 --> 01:19:36.636
That's what I thought.

01:19:37.072 --> 01:19:39.439
Now let's go get some food
and we'll hit the road.

01:19:40.242 --> 01:19:42.877
I'll have a few words
with... Sug.

01:19:44.979 --> 01:19:46.113
All right.

01:19:56.925 --> 01:19:58.125
So where you from?

01:19:59.927 --> 01:20:01.662
Brownwood, Texas.

01:20:02.163 --> 01:20:05.733
- Never been there.
- Don't bother. Nothing to see.

01:20:06.835 --> 01:20:08.536
How long did you live there?

01:20:09.671 --> 01:20:10.904
Long enough.

01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:15.876
And then after the
woman I loved... left,

01:20:16.677 --> 01:20:18.479
I decided to hit the road.

01:20:19.747 --> 01:20:21.181
What about your family?

01:20:22.751 --> 01:20:24.051
No family.

01:20:25.654 --> 01:20:27.054
My folks are dead.

01:20:28.957 --> 01:20:30.056
Oh.

01:20:31.193 --> 01:20:32.426
What happened?

01:20:34.796 --> 01:20:36.497
They both died when I was a kid.

01:20:38.632 --> 01:20:39.966
My daddy used to get drunk

01:20:39.969 --> 01:20:42.036
at the same country
western bar every night,

01:20:43.137 --> 01:20:46.073
get in fights, get kicked out.

01:20:47.475 --> 01:20:50.176
Then he'd come home
and beat up on my mama and me.

01:20:51.947 --> 01:20:53.713
And it went on
that way for years.

01:20:55.550 --> 01:20:56.884
Then one night...

01:20:58.353 --> 01:21:00.554
Someone cut his brakes
while he was in the bar.

01:21:03.792 --> 01:21:05.225
It just so happened

01:21:05.228 --> 01:21:07.694
when mama got dropped off
to check up on him,

01:21:07.697 --> 01:21:09.496
make sure he was all right,

01:21:09.497 --> 01:21:11.198
and drive his truck home,

01:21:13.467 --> 01:21:14.801
it was raining,

01:21:15.337 --> 01:21:16.337
hard to see,

01:21:18.340 --> 01:21:20.940
and there was this bridge
between our house and the bar.

01:21:23.345 --> 01:21:25.045
The truck went right
off the bridge.

01:21:25.913 --> 01:21:27.381
They both drowned.

01:21:28.515 --> 01:21:29.783
Oh my god.

01:21:30.217 --> 01:21:32.086
Did they ever catch
the guy who did it?

01:21:34.521 --> 01:21:35.622
No.

01:21:38.659 --> 01:21:39.926
I'm sorry.

01:21:40.494 --> 01:21:42.162
Nothing to be sorry for.

01:21:43.198 --> 01:21:44.765
What's done is done.

01:21:47.702 --> 01:21:49.569
I went to live with
my gram after that.

01:21:49.572 --> 01:21:51.404
She was a good woman.

01:21:53.341 --> 01:21:55.009
After she passed away she...

01:21:55.777 --> 01:21:57.344
Left me everything she had,

01:21:58.747 --> 01:22:00.613
including this car
she never drove.

01:22:02.283 --> 01:22:04.251
And instead of buying
some chunk of land,

01:22:04.719 --> 01:22:06.252
I decided to see the world,

01:22:07.055 --> 01:22:08.988
maybe find a woman
that was worth loving.

01:22:10.024 --> 01:22:11.524
And how's that been?

01:22:13.795 --> 01:22:15.095
Disappointing.

01:22:16.131 --> 01:22:17.430
Why's that?

01:22:18.033 --> 01:22:21.167
People let you down
time and again.

01:22:22.636 --> 01:22:24.438
There's a lot of
ugliness in the world.

01:22:25.707 --> 01:22:26.940
Too much.

01:22:28.542 --> 01:22:29.643
Matter of fact,

01:22:29.645 --> 01:22:31.845
you're the first pretty thing
I've seen in a long time.

01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:34.515
I'm not pretty.

01:22:34.882 --> 01:22:36.283
Sure you are.

01:22:36.952 --> 01:22:39.153
Pretty's not just
on the outside, you know.

01:22:40.587 --> 01:22:42.122
But you've got both.

01:22:43.490 --> 01:22:44.725
Well, thanks.

01:22:45.894 --> 01:22:47.461
Just speaking the truth.

01:22:51.298 --> 01:22:53.458
Would you ever think about
trying to get married again?

01:22:54.903 --> 01:22:56.036
I always thought

01:22:56.237 --> 01:22:58.117
there was only one way
I would ever get married.

01:22:58.472 --> 01:22:59.739
What's that?

01:23:00.108 --> 01:23:01.841
By Elvis in a drive-thru chapel.

01:23:03.078 --> 01:23:04.645
That's romantic.

01:23:06.948 --> 01:23:08.948
Still haven't found
the right woman though,

01:23:08.951 --> 01:23:10.484
not yet.

01:23:12.854 --> 01:23:14.253
Maybe one day.

01:23:16.157 --> 01:23:17.323
Yeah.

01:23:19.761 --> 01:23:21.662
Well, enough talking.

01:23:21.663 --> 01:23:23.363
We got some driving to do.

01:23:34.809 --> 01:23:36.010
Engine trouble?

01:23:36.011 --> 01:23:37.543
To say the least.

01:23:39.113 --> 01:23:41.314
She looks real nice
for an old car though.

01:23:41.317 --> 01:23:43.516
She's pretty on the outside,
but...

01:23:44.219 --> 01:23:45.853
The inside's a different story,

01:23:47.389 --> 01:23:49.222
like a lot of folks I've met.

01:23:52.327 --> 01:23:53.961
She served me well though.

01:23:53.962 --> 01:23:56.529
Might be high time
to trade her in for a new one,

01:23:57.032 --> 01:23:58.731
maybe a tricked-out hot rod.

01:23:59.067 --> 01:24:00.533
I could help you pick one out.

01:24:00.536 --> 01:24:03.069
I love old cars,
especially hot rods.

01:24:03.872 --> 01:24:05.773
We may just get along, Roxy.

01:24:11.646 --> 01:24:14.581
Well, let's go get
what's coming to you.

01:24:39.006 --> 01:24:40.407
Which one is it?

01:24:41.509 --> 01:24:43.444
It's the green one
up there on the left.

01:24:46.346 --> 01:24:47.613
You see his car?

01:24:49.050 --> 01:24:51.085
Yeah.
It's right across the street.

01:24:54.756 --> 01:24:55.823
All right.

01:24:57.891 --> 01:24:59.326
What are you gonna do?

01:25:01.595 --> 01:25:03.463
I'm gonna get your money back.

01:25:05.399 --> 01:25:07.600
You stay here, keep
the door locked.

01:25:08.302 --> 01:25:11.270
When you see me coming down
the street, back to the car,

01:25:11.972 --> 01:25:14.373
get her started up and
open my door for me, okay?

01:25:15.042 --> 01:25:16.176
Yeah, okay.

01:25:32.127 --> 01:25:33.627
I don't like guns,

01:25:34.595 --> 01:25:35.962
but people tend to listen better

01:25:35.965 --> 01:25:37.797
when you're pointing
one at them.

01:25:43.270 --> 01:25:45.005
You're not gonna
hurt him, are you?

01:25:46.140 --> 01:25:47.807
Some people need to be hurt.

01:26:24.479 --> 01:26:25.779
Man, what you want?

01:26:25.780 --> 01:26:27.547
I'm here to see Sug.

01:26:29.384 --> 01:26:30.551
About what?

01:26:32.554 --> 01:26:34.188
I got some money to give him.

01:26:35.289 --> 01:26:37.658
Oh shit, brother,
why didn't you say so?

01:26:37.659 --> 01:26:38.891
Come on in.

01:26:40.962 --> 01:26:43.630
This party's blazing like
them saddles, you heard?

01:26:44.064 --> 01:26:46.500
Yeah.
Sure.

01:26:53.140 --> 01:26:55.242
Yo, Sug, this white
boy's here to see you.

01:26:55.243 --> 01:26:56.944
He say he got some
money for you.

01:26:59.314 --> 01:27:00.413
Word.

01:27:01.048 --> 01:27:03.283
Come on in, son, join the party.

01:27:03.885 --> 01:27:06.853
We getting higher than Georgia
pie up in this motherfucker,

01:27:06.854 --> 01:27:08.488
you know what I'm saying?

01:27:11.826 --> 01:27:13.327
Nice suit, Sug.

01:27:14.362 --> 01:27:16.363
Oh yeah, you like my style?

01:27:16.364 --> 01:27:17.898
Well, I'm Sug white,

01:27:17.899 --> 01:27:20.333
so I always wear a little
white on the outside,

01:27:20.336 --> 01:27:22.569
but underneath it's all black.

01:27:22.570 --> 01:27:24.238
That's the color of my people.

01:27:24.239 --> 01:27:25.738
I'm the blackest
motherfucker in here.

01:27:25.740 --> 01:27:27.274
Any of these motherfuckers
will tell you.

01:27:27.275 --> 01:27:28.875
Ain't that right, Kronkite?

01:27:28.877 --> 01:27:32.078
Yeah, Sug, you
blacker than a motherfucker

01:27:32.081 --> 01:27:33.579
with your black ass.

01:27:36.752 --> 01:27:38.851
Well, come have a seat, son.

01:27:38.854 --> 01:27:42.122
Thanks, but I really can't stay.

01:27:42.123 --> 01:27:44.157
I just came to take
care of some business.

01:27:45.960 --> 01:27:47.793
You wanna talk about business?

01:27:47.796 --> 01:27:48.962
Shit.

01:27:48.963 --> 01:27:50.396
We can talk about business

01:27:50.399 --> 01:27:52.265
after you come and
get high with me

01:27:52.268 --> 01:27:54.568
and these fine ass
bitches over here.

01:27:54.569 --> 01:27:56.069
So come have a seat

01:27:56.070 --> 01:27:58.104
and hit this motherfucking pipe.

01:27:58.805 --> 01:28:01.475
Like I said, I don't have time.

01:28:02.310 --> 01:28:06.145
Can we step into the other room
and get this taken care of?

01:28:06.713 --> 01:28:08.981
Goddamn!

01:28:08.984 --> 01:28:11.818
Every-motherfucking-body's
so goddamn serious today!

01:28:11.819 --> 01:28:14.755
Why can't y'all just chill
and relax with a motherfucker?

01:28:14.756 --> 01:28:16.622
Y'all need to loosen up.

01:28:16.625 --> 01:28:18.859
Chill out! Get high.

01:28:21.296 --> 01:28:23.697
Fuck some tightly wound
motherfuckers, you know that?

01:28:24.832 --> 01:28:27.466
Them bitches be tightly
wound these days, lo-lo.

01:28:27.469 --> 01:28:28.801
For sure, Sug.

01:28:28.804 --> 01:28:30.936
These bitches be tighter
than a motherfucker,

01:28:30.939 --> 01:28:33.472
especially these punk
ass bitches right here.

01:28:33.475 --> 01:28:35.309
You know we keep it
tight for you, Sug.

01:28:35.310 --> 01:28:38.645
We better believe that,

01:28:38.646 --> 01:28:41.547
because all my bitches be tight,

01:28:42.317 --> 01:28:45.851
because if it ain't tight,
it don't belong to Sug white,

01:28:45.854 --> 01:28:47.020
you heard?

01:28:47.021 --> 01:28:49.488
I'll throw that loose ass
pussy back out on the street!

01:28:52.827 --> 01:28:54.261
You hear me talking, bitch?

01:28:54.628 --> 01:28:57.029
Yeah, Sug, I hear you.

01:28:57.532 --> 01:28:58.965
That's good, baby.

01:28:58.966 --> 01:29:00.567
That's real good.

01:29:03.270 --> 01:29:06.172
Now y'all chill here
while I go in the other room

01:29:06.175 --> 01:29:09.176
with mister tightly wound
tight ass motherfucker

01:29:09.177 --> 01:29:11.511
talking about some
business, all right?

01:29:11.512 --> 01:29:14.547
Shit, Sug, I got these
bitches on lock down.

01:29:14.550 --> 01:29:16.615
Go ahead do your thing, pimp.

01:29:17.385 --> 01:29:19.618
Word. Word.

01:29:22.457 --> 01:29:24.957
Goddamn!

01:29:25.525 --> 01:29:28.561
That's some strong ass
shit we've been smoking!

01:29:28.564 --> 01:29:32.798
I am dizzy as a motherfucker!

01:29:33.201 --> 01:29:36.036
Man, Sug, you know
my shit is dope, man.

01:29:36.037 --> 01:29:38.037
You know I keep it real, baby.

01:29:38.039 --> 01:29:41.006
Goddamn, I guess you do.

01:29:41.009 --> 01:29:42.408
I guess you do.

01:29:43.010 --> 01:29:44.610
All right, son,

01:29:45.179 --> 01:29:46.412
let's chop it up.

01:30:03.163 --> 01:30:04.564
Please, god,

01:30:05.533 --> 01:30:06.666
please.

01:30:14.942 --> 01:30:16.676
All right, motherfucker.

01:30:16.677 --> 01:30:19.112
Now we in the other room.

01:30:19.780 --> 01:30:21.680
My dude says you got
some guac for me,

01:30:21.682 --> 01:30:23.082
so let's see that shit.

01:30:23.085 --> 01:30:24.917
And it better be from Mario.

01:30:25.586 --> 01:30:27.854
Yeah, it's from Mario.

01:30:28.922 --> 01:30:30.957
Shit.
About goddamn time.

01:30:30.958 --> 01:30:33.292
That Cholo's owed me
for two fucking weeks.

01:30:34.228 --> 01:30:35.862
Except your dude was wrong.

01:30:38.099 --> 01:30:39.698
I'm here to collect some guac.

01:30:42.403 --> 01:30:46.640
Now I know I'm high as
shit right now,

01:30:47.774 --> 01:30:50.877
but it looks like you
pointing a Glock at me.

01:30:51.712 --> 01:30:52.979
You thought right,

01:30:53.448 --> 01:30:55.649
because you took something
from a friend of mine.

01:30:56.082 --> 01:30:57.451
What fucking friend?

01:30:58.618 --> 01:30:59.953
Roxy.

01:30:59.954 --> 01:31:01.454
Sug: Roxy?

01:31:01.457 --> 01:31:04.291
That fucking bitch?
She's done, man.

01:31:04.292 --> 01:31:07.092
She don't work for me no more.
She's out!

01:31:07.095 --> 01:31:08.795
And I don't owe her shit!

01:31:08.796 --> 01:31:11.363
She owes me
for all I done for her.

01:31:11.798 --> 01:31:12.998
Is that right?

01:31:13.634 --> 01:31:15.836
Yeah, motherfucker,
that's right.

01:31:15.837 --> 01:31:17.604
That's not what I heard.

01:31:17.605 --> 01:31:19.271
I heard you took
some money from her

01:31:19.274 --> 01:31:20.539
that she worked hard for,

01:31:21.141 --> 01:31:22.242
real hard.

01:31:22.243 --> 01:31:24.743
Nah, nah, nah, you see,

01:31:24.746 --> 01:31:26.613
when a bitch works for me,

01:31:26.614 --> 01:31:29.015
she works for me.

01:31:29.016 --> 01:31:31.083
She don't keep that shit.

01:31:31.086 --> 01:31:33.052
Sug white keeps that shit!

01:31:34.322 --> 01:31:35.755
Not today, Sug.

01:31:36.490 --> 01:31:39.091
So why don't you hand over
what you owe her,

01:31:39.094 --> 01:31:41.027
along with any other
cash lying around,

01:31:41.595 --> 01:31:43.029
and we'll call it even.

01:31:43.030 --> 01:31:44.764
Then I'll be on my way.

01:31:48.536 --> 01:31:50.337
I like you, son.

01:31:50.338 --> 01:31:53.206
You crazy as a motherfucker,

01:31:53.841 --> 01:31:55.675
just like me.

01:31:55.676 --> 01:31:57.176
So I'll tell you what.

01:31:57.845 --> 01:31:59.813
I'm gonna give you
that loot back.

01:31:59.814 --> 01:32:01.614
It ain't shit to me.

01:32:01.617 --> 01:32:03.182
And then you and me,

01:32:03.185 --> 01:32:04.984
we're gonna go back
in the other room,

01:32:04.987 --> 01:32:06.685
we're gonna get high together

01:32:06.688 --> 01:32:10.957
like a couple of crazy ass
motherfuckers, you dig?

01:32:14.694 --> 01:32:16.962
Motherfucker try to rob me!

01:32:16.965 --> 01:32:18.832
You don't rob Sug white!

01:32:21.668 --> 01:32:23.036
The fuck?

01:32:23.037 --> 01:32:24.537
Where the fuck is my piece at?

01:32:24.539 --> 01:32:27.340
Man, I don't know, brother.
I left my shit in the 'lac yo.

01:32:27.341 --> 01:32:28.574
Me too.

01:32:28.577 --> 01:32:30.476
I'm getting the
fuck out of here!

01:32:30.479 --> 01:32:32.279
Sit your ass down, bitch!

01:32:34.515 --> 01:32:36.181
Hold on, hold on, killer.

01:32:36.184 --> 01:32:37.751
It's all good, we
all family here,

01:32:37.752 --> 01:32:39.386
just chill buddy.

01:32:39.753 --> 01:32:41.054
I ought to blow

01:32:41.055 --> 01:32:43.189
every one of your goddamn
heads off right now,

01:32:43.190 --> 01:32:45.257
but I'm gonna give
you a chance to live.

01:32:45.893 --> 01:32:47.560
Ah man, just
anything, name it, baby,

01:32:47.563 --> 01:32:49.229
we got your back.

01:32:49.230 --> 01:32:51.064
You're gonna show me
where Sug keeps his money,

01:32:51.065 --> 01:32:53.500
and you're gonna give it to me,
all of it,

01:32:53.502 --> 01:32:55.201
or I'm gonna shoot
you in the kidney

01:32:55.203 --> 01:32:57.703
and let you bleed out,
just like Sug.

01:32:57.706 --> 01:32:59.005
You understand me?

01:32:59.006 --> 01:33:02.175
Man, we ain't telling you shit.
You killed Sug.

01:33:03.243 --> 01:33:05.110
Under the mattress
in the bedroom.

01:33:05.113 --> 01:33:06.479
Damn, bitch!

01:33:07.081 --> 01:33:11.251
Good. Now let's all go and get
it together, nice and slow,

01:33:11.252 --> 01:33:13.086
and if anyone decides
to do something stupid

01:33:13.087 --> 01:33:14.453
or follow me out of here,

01:33:14.456 --> 01:33:15.622
just remember,

01:33:15.689 --> 01:33:17.524
I have a car full of
big, bad motherfuckers

01:33:17.525 --> 01:33:19.525
armed to the teeth
and ready to shoot,

01:33:20.194 --> 01:33:21.461
you dig?

01:33:27.234 --> 01:33:28.335
Come on.

01:33:29.604 --> 01:33:30.770
Come on.

01:33:33.073 --> 01:33:34.073
Come on.

01:33:53.661 --> 01:33:55.028
Did you get it?

01:33:55.729 --> 01:33:57.130
I got it.

01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:00.833
What about Sug?

01:34:03.337 --> 01:34:05.305
You don't have to
worry about Sug anymore.

01:34:11.112 --> 01:34:13.646
I feel like going
to a nice ritzy hotel tonight.

01:34:13.649 --> 01:34:15.481
How about you?

01:34:15.484 --> 01:34:16.983
Sounds nice.

01:34:42.643 --> 01:34:45.211
Well, I think
this'll do the trick.

01:35:09.369 --> 01:35:12.137
No one's ever done anything
that nice for me before.

01:35:13.173 --> 01:35:14.908
I wasn't being nice.

01:35:15.909 --> 01:35:17.911
I was doing what had to be done.

01:35:21.750 --> 01:35:23.716
You're fucking
amazing, you know that?

01:35:24.518 --> 01:35:25.918
I ain't amazing.

01:35:27.587 --> 01:35:29.389
I just do what I think is right.

01:35:45.739 --> 01:35:47.340
Think that was right?

01:35:50.077 --> 01:35:51.478
It's hard to say.

01:35:54.582 --> 01:35:55.748
Not just yet.

01:35:57.952 --> 01:35:59.018
Well...

01:36:00.755 --> 01:36:03.021
I guess we'll just
have to keep on trying.

01:36:05.458 --> 01:36:07.092
I guess we will.

01:36:17.805 --> 01:36:19.706
I haven't felt this
good lying next to someone

01:36:19.707 --> 01:36:20.840
in a long time,

01:36:21.609 --> 01:36:22.675
maybe ever.

01:36:25.145 --> 01:36:27.313
It's been a long
time for me too.

01:36:29.649 --> 01:36:31.384
You're something special.

01:36:33.087 --> 01:36:34.621
You really think so?

01:36:35.922 --> 01:36:37.023
I do.

01:36:39.793 --> 01:36:42.228
I can't remember the last
time I had a better night.

01:36:43.963 --> 01:36:45.064
I mean it.

01:36:55.743 --> 01:36:56.975
What are you crying for?

01:37:03.082 --> 01:37:04.850
I have to tell you something.

01:37:07.154 --> 01:37:08.988
Then go ahead, tell me.

01:37:13.493 --> 01:37:14.894
I lied to you.

01:37:15.762 --> 01:37:17.229
I'm not a dancer.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:21.501
Then what are you?

01:37:24.604 --> 01:37:25.838
A call girl.

01:37:28.108 --> 01:37:29.274
A whore.

01:37:31.478 --> 01:37:33.512
I figured
that might be the case.

01:37:34.782 --> 01:37:36.716
Especially after I met Sug.

01:37:39.686 --> 01:37:42.354
My parents kicked me
out after high school.

01:37:44.792 --> 01:37:46.091
Got into drugs,

01:37:47.027 --> 01:37:48.694
real bad grades.

01:37:51.198 --> 01:37:53.565
I wanted to go
to cosmetology school,

01:37:54.335 --> 01:37:55.935
but they wouldn't help me.

01:37:56.537 --> 01:37:58.904
They said I had
to pay my own way,

01:37:59.974 --> 01:38:01.373
and Sug...

01:38:04.177 --> 01:38:06.546
Sug was the only one
who would take me in.

01:38:08.849 --> 01:38:10.315
He got me into it.

01:38:12.185 --> 01:38:15.154
He said he would save up for me.

01:38:19.092 --> 01:38:20.827
I did it for the money,

01:38:22.095 --> 01:38:23.128
and I couldn't get out.

01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:28.568
It was all for my dream,

01:38:28.569 --> 01:38:31.170
so I could quit and start over.

01:38:36.609 --> 01:38:38.243
I'm sorry I lied to you.

01:38:38.779 --> 01:38:40.680
I don't ever wanna lie to you.

01:38:44.118 --> 01:38:47.453
But I understand if you're
mad and you want me to leave.

01:38:50.591 --> 01:38:51.823
I ain't mad.

01:38:54.060 --> 01:38:55.828
- You're not?
- No.

01:38:58.131 --> 01:38:59.599
You did what you had to do

01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:01.301
to get where you
wanna go in life.

01:39:02.536 --> 01:39:03.836
It's admirable.

01:39:05.305 --> 01:39:06.538
It takes guts.

01:39:09.109 --> 01:39:10.510
Thank you.

01:39:23.157 --> 01:39:25.625
I haven't been totally
honest with you either.

01:39:29.395 --> 01:39:30.529
About what?

01:39:33.567 --> 01:39:34.867
That story...

01:39:35.903 --> 01:39:37.804
About my folks getting killed,

01:39:41.408 --> 01:39:43.042
it's only part true.

01:39:46.180 --> 01:39:47.646
What do you mean?

01:39:49.817 --> 01:39:52.417
My daddy used
to beat on us so bad

01:39:54.121 --> 01:39:55.854
that I couldn't go to school,

01:39:58.492 --> 01:40:00.926
because the other kids would
make fun of my black eye.

01:40:04.331 --> 01:40:07.065
My mama was the sweetest
woman in the whole world,

01:40:09.703 --> 01:40:11.203
but she was weak.

01:40:13.140 --> 01:40:14.940
She never could
put an end to it.

01:40:19.645 --> 01:40:21.546
So I knew what I had to do.

01:40:24.118 --> 01:40:25.752
I went out that night

01:40:26.787 --> 01:40:28.787
and saw my daddy's
truck at the bar,

01:40:31.158 --> 01:40:34.027
and they showed us where the
brake lines were in auto shop.

01:40:37.730 --> 01:40:39.731
I didn't know my
mama was in there.

01:40:42.036 --> 01:40:43.569
I thought she was asleep.

01:40:49.143 --> 01:40:51.277
I didn't know she'd
be driving that truck.

01:40:54.414 --> 01:40:56.448
I've never told anyone that.

01:41:01.822 --> 01:41:03.389
You were abused.

01:41:05.391 --> 01:41:06.993
You were just a kid.

01:41:08.228 --> 01:41:09.561
You didn't know any better.

01:41:09.564 --> 01:41:11.564
I'd have probably
done the same thing.

01:41:12.065 --> 01:41:14.266
You tried to stop it.

01:41:17.171 --> 01:41:18.671
You didn't know
she was in there.

01:41:18.672 --> 01:41:19.971
It was an accident.

01:41:22.275 --> 01:41:24.077
I kept seeing her after that.

01:41:29.248 --> 01:41:30.983
Everywhere I looked,

01:41:32.586 --> 01:41:33.819
there she was,

01:41:35.255 --> 01:41:36.488
staring at me,

01:41:38.125 --> 01:41:39.658
asking me why I done it.

01:41:42.429 --> 01:41:44.663
It didn't stop until
I met Carol Ann.

01:41:47.868 --> 01:41:49.167
I loved her.

01:41:51.771 --> 01:41:53.271
I thought she loved me.

01:41:58.045 --> 01:42:01.146
Then she started
going out, drinking,

01:42:03.283 --> 01:42:05.484
coming home, calling me
some other guy's name,

01:42:07.087 --> 01:42:08.820
treating me like I was nothing.

01:42:10.823 --> 01:42:12.158
I found out...

01:42:13.393 --> 01:42:15.060
She'd been unfaithful,

01:42:17.797 --> 01:42:19.297
so I ended it.

01:42:23.804 --> 01:42:25.404
After she was gone,

01:42:26.439 --> 01:42:28.207
I kept seeing her too.

01:42:31.011 --> 01:42:32.478
Everywhere.

01:42:34.480 --> 01:42:35.715
Every woman.

01:42:40.154 --> 01:42:41.554
Until I met you.

01:42:44.024 --> 01:42:45.824
You won't see her again.

01:42:46.926 --> 01:42:48.728
I'll make sure you don't.

01:43:05.845 --> 01:43:07.012
Dwayne?

01:43:08.015 --> 01:43:09.181
Yeah?

01:43:12.552 --> 01:43:14.886
Would you ever think
about marrying me one day

01:43:14.889 --> 01:43:16.555
if everything worked out?

01:43:18.292 --> 01:43:19.591
I don't know.

01:43:23.363 --> 01:43:25.064
What if I loved you,

01:43:25.065 --> 01:43:26.899
and what if you loved me?

01:43:33.873 --> 01:43:35.975
The last time I
almost got married,

01:43:37.743 --> 01:43:39.244
things ended bad.

01:43:41.547 --> 01:43:42.747
Real bad.

01:43:45.652 --> 01:43:47.920
I don't wanna make
that same mistake twice.

01:43:54.994 --> 01:43:57.395
- I understand. I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry.

01:44:00.266 --> 01:44:02.301
Just give me a while
to think, okay?

01:44:03.436 --> 01:44:04.670
Okay.

01:44:38.771 --> 01:44:40.171
You ready for this?

01:44:41.774 --> 01:44:43.442
As ready as I'll ever be.

01:44:44.978 --> 01:44:46.378
Well let's go.

01:45:11.438 --> 01:45:14.006
Do you, Roxanne McLean,

01:45:14.007 --> 01:45:16.141
take this man, Dwayne Duncan,

01:45:16.144 --> 01:45:18.644
to be your lawfully
wedded husband

01:45:18.645 --> 01:45:20.578
and hunk,
a hunk of burning love,

01:45:21.081 --> 01:45:22.881
to have and to hold,

01:45:23.516 --> 01:45:25.318
in sickness and in health,

01:45:25.319 --> 01:45:27.420
for better or for worse,

01:45:27.421 --> 01:45:29.055
'til death do you part?

01:45:29.789 --> 01:45:30.823
I do.

01:45:30.824 --> 01:45:32.824
Elvis: Rocking, baby doll!

01:45:32.827 --> 01:45:35.394
And do you, Dwayne Duncan,

01:45:36.162 --> 01:45:38.863
do you take this
woman, Roxanne McLean,

01:45:38.865 --> 01:45:41.033
to be your lawfully wedded wife,

01:45:41.702 --> 01:45:43.769
to have and to hold

01:45:43.770 --> 01:45:45.470
in sickness and in health,

01:45:45.472 --> 01:45:46.939
for better or for worse,

01:45:46.940 --> 01:45:48.506
'til death do you part?

01:45:59.853 --> 01:46:01.186
What's it gonna be, partner?

01:46:15.202 --> 01:46:16.402
Excuse us.

01:46:20.039 --> 01:46:21.407
Goddamn kids.

01:46:26.380 --> 01:46:28.881
Hey. What is it?
What's wrong?

01:46:30.516 --> 01:46:31.817
It's no good.

01:46:33.854 --> 01:46:37.489
- What do you mean?
- I mean it's no good.

01:46:38.992 --> 01:46:41.159
It'll never work.

01:46:42.328 --> 01:46:44.497
How can you say that?
I love you.

01:46:46.399 --> 01:46:49.502
I've been looking
for you my whole life.

01:46:50.904 --> 01:46:52.337
You're beautiful.

01:46:52.738 --> 01:46:56.007
And I thought I was cut out
for all this, but I'm not!

01:46:57.411 --> 01:46:58.844
I'm not like you.

01:46:59.845 --> 01:47:01.146
I will hurt you,

01:47:02.082 --> 01:47:03.815
just like I hurt Carol Ann

01:47:04.251 --> 01:47:05.818
after she hurt me.

01:47:07.386 --> 01:47:08.988
You won't hurt me.

01:47:09.622 --> 01:47:11.356
I've been hurt
plenty in the past,

01:47:11.359 --> 01:47:15.027
but you make me feel
like no one ever has.

01:47:16.229 --> 01:47:17.762
You saved me.

01:47:19.966 --> 01:47:21.833
I don't wanna live without you.

01:47:25.738 --> 01:47:27.338
I know you're scared.

01:47:28.375 --> 01:47:29.675
Just trust me.

01:47:30.243 --> 01:47:31.510
Trust yourself.

01:47:33.113 --> 01:47:34.712
We'll be okay, I promise.

01:47:41.720 --> 01:47:42.921
What's it gonna be, kids?

01:47:42.923 --> 01:47:45.724
I got 14 more ceremonies
to do today.

01:48:02.074 --> 01:48:04.510
Now reach in my
pocket and grab the key.

01:48:04.511 --> 01:48:05.610
Not that one.

01:48:05.613 --> 01:48:06.945
The other one.

01:48:06.948 --> 01:48:08.480
Got it.

01:48:08.483 --> 01:48:10.649
Now open the door
before my arms fall off.

01:48:17.323 --> 01:48:18.890
It's official now!

01:48:27.501 --> 01:48:29.001
I think this is it.

01:48:29.636 --> 01:48:30.869
What?

01:48:32.372 --> 01:48:33.572
My destiny.

01:48:35.108 --> 01:48:36.242
And yours.

01:48:38.677 --> 01:48:40.045
I think you're right.

01:48:42.047 --> 01:48:44.850
And now I'm gonna get
out of this dress,

01:48:45.351 --> 01:48:48.253
and you and me are gonna
consummate our marriage.

01:48:49.189 --> 01:48:50.588
I'll be right back.

01:49:02.302 --> 01:49:03.636
Roxy: <i> Close that door.</i>

01:49:03.637 --> 01:49:05.570
<i>I don't want the whole
hotel to hear us.</i>

01:49:13.313 --> 01:49:14.880
<i>Baby, I'm almost ready.</i>

01:49:15.381 --> 01:49:17.416
<i>You ready to fulfill my destiny?</i>

01:49:24.858 --> 01:49:26.091
Yes, I am.

01:49:32.164 --> 01:49:33.998
Roxy: <i> I love you, you know?</i>

01:49:34.501 --> 01:49:35.900
Dwayne: <i> I know.</i>

01:49:37.404 --> 01:49:39.337
<i>There ain't nowhere
to go from here.</i>

01:49:40.707 --> 01:49:42.274
Roxy: <i> What do you mean?</i>

01:49:42.908 --> 01:49:44.109
<i>No!</i>

01:49:46.412 --> 01:49:47.979
<i>You don't have to.</i>

01:49:48.914 --> 01:49:50.649
Dwayne: <i> Yes, I do.</i>

01:49:51.585 --> 01:49:53.118
<i>That's what I am.</i>

01:49:55.287 --> 01:49:56.822
<i>There ain't no changing that.</i>

01:49:57.305 --> 01:50:03.895
