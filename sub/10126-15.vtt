00:20.600 --> 00:22.967
MY COLUMN, MY COLUMN,
MY COLUMN--

00:22.967 --> 00:24.100
HEH HEH--MY COLUMN.

00:24.100 --> 00:26.000
"IS IT JUST ME?"

00:26.000 --> 00:27.000
BY...

00:27.000 --> 00:28.767
"CORY MATTHEWS."
DO I HAVE TO?

00:28.767 --> 00:29.900
ENJOY.

00:29.900 --> 00:31.000
"IS IT JUST ME,

00:31.000 --> 00:34.600
"OR DOES PASTE NOT TASTE
AS GOOD AS IT USED TO?

00:34.600 --> 00:36.500
"IS IT JUST ME,

00:36.500 --> 00:39.300
OR IS HOMER SIMPSON
GETTING A LITTLE TOO OLD
TO BE ON THE SHOW?"

00:39.300 --> 00:43.500
HA. ISN'T THAT
SO TRUE?

00:43.500 --> 00:44.967
CORY, I KNOW
YOU REALLY BELIEVE IN

00:44.967 --> 00:46.600
YOUR LITTLE HUMOR COLUMN,
BUT, UH...

00:46.600 --> 00:47.667
DON'T YA THINK

00:47.667 --> 00:48.967
YOU SHOULD BE WRITING
ABOUT SOMETHING

00:48.967 --> 00:49.967
A LITTLE MORE IMPORTANT,

00:49.967 --> 00:51.800
LIKE
THE GIRLS' SWIM TEAM

00:51.800 --> 00:54.600
AND WHY THEY DON'T
WEAR HIGH HEELS?

00:54.600 --> 00:57.567
SO, DEBBIE, GARY TOOK YOU
TO LE CHARDONNAY?

00:57.567 --> 00:58.700
IT'S REALLY EXPENSIVE.

00:58.700 --> 01:01.200
YEAH, I KNOW.
IT WAS GREAT.

01:01.200 --> 01:02.400
WE WERE TALKING
AND LAUGHING

01:02.400 --> 01:03.867
AND HAVING
SUCH A GREAT TIME
AND THEN...

01:03.867 --> 01:05.233
AT THE END OF THE NIGHT...

01:05.233 --> 01:06.900
PARKED 2 BLOCKS
FROM MY HOUSE...

01:06.900 --> 01:08.133
OCTOPUS TIME.

01:08.133 --> 01:10.900
HEY...

01:10.900 --> 01:12.900
HAD A NICE NIGHT
THE OTHER NIGHT.
HA HA.

01:14.567 --> 01:16.600
ALL OVER ME.

01:16.600 --> 01:18.667
WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE NICE GUY
I HAD DINNER WITH?

01:18.667 --> 01:20.567
IT'S LIKE, THE NIGHT'S
ALMOST OVER,

01:20.567 --> 01:22.300
SO HE'S ALL OVER ME?

01:22.300 --> 01:25.500
WHY ARE GUYS
SUCH JERKS ON DATES?

01:25.500 --> 01:26.934
NOT ALL GUYS, DEBBIE.

01:26.934 --> 01:29.467
"NOT ALL GUYS,
DEBBIE."

01:29.467 --> 01:32.100
IS IT JUST ME,
OR SHOULD YOU NOT
BE PROUD OF THAT?

01:32.100 --> 01:33.400
OH.

01:33.400 --> 01:35.200
AFTER A NIGHT
OF FIGHTING THEM OFF,
IT'S LIKE...

01:35.200 --> 01:38.600
I DON'T KNOW
WHETHER I WANNA GO OUT
ON DATES ANYMORE.

01:38.600 --> 01:41.734
RATHER SPEND MY TIME
AT THE LIBRARY.

01:41.734 --> 01:43.233
IT'S THAT PATHETIC.

01:43.233 --> 01:45.200
IT'S TOO BAD
GUYS AND GIRLS HAVE
SUCH A DIFFERENT IDEA

01:45.200 --> 01:46.967
ABOUT WHAT A DATE
IS SUPPOSED TO BE.

01:46.967 --> 01:49.200
YEAH. WHAT GOES ON
IN THEIR HEADS?

01:49.200 --> 01:51.867
WANNA FIND OUT?
THERE'S 2 OF 'EM.

01:51.867 --> 01:53.834
HEY, WHAT GOES ON
IN YOUR HEADS?

01:53.834 --> 01:58.133
TOPANGA. 24 HOURS A DAY,
IT'S THE TOPANGA CHANNEL
IN HERE.

01:58.133 --> 02:00.133
AW, WHO'S A GOOD BOY?

02:00.133 --> 02:02.600
HEH HEH.

02:02.600 --> 02:06.133
DEBBIE, DON'T YOU THINK
THAT GUYS AND GIRLS

02:06.133 --> 02:07.734
ARE LOOKING FOR
THE SAME THINGS
ON DATES?

02:07.734 --> 02:12.500
WELL, GIRLS ARE
LOOKING FOR AN EVENING
OF GOOD CONVERSATION

02:12.500 --> 02:14.567
AND, YOU KNOW,
THE SENSE THAT
YOU'VE MADE

02:14.567 --> 02:17.300
A GENUINE CONNECTION
WITH ANOTHER
HUMAN BEING.

02:17.300 --> 02:18.834
YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED
IN MAKING OUT?

02:18.834 --> 02:20.400
MAYBE I AM
AND MAYBE I'M NOT,

02:20.400 --> 02:21.567
BUT IT SHOULDN'T
BE EXPECTED

02:21.567 --> 02:23.300
BECAUSE I WENT ON
A DATE WITH YOU.

02:23.300 --> 02:24.900
HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO KNOW WHAT'S OK?

02:24.900 --> 02:26.467
WE'LL LET YA KNOW.

02:26.467 --> 02:28.100
YOU DON'T LET US KNOW
VERY CLEARLY.

02:28.100 --> 02:29.834
YES, WE DO.
YOU JUST DON'T LISTEN.

02:29.834 --> 02:33.000
YOU'RE TOO BUSY
PLANNING YOUR NEXT MOVE
TO HEAR US SAY NO.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.967
WHAT?

02:35.967 --> 02:38.467
THIS IS WHY I WRITE
MY FUNNY COLUMN.

02:38.467 --> 02:40.400
TO TAKE US AWAY
FROM THE DRUDGERY

02:40.400 --> 02:41.834
OF INTERESTING
CONVERSATION.

02:41.834 --> 02:44.200
BUT YOU SHOULD BE
WRITING ABOUT SOMETHING
THAT AFFECTS PEOPLE.

02:44.200 --> 02:45.400
WHY DON'T YOU
WRITE YOUR COLUMN

02:45.400 --> 02:47.934
ABOUT WHY GUYS
ARE SUCH BIG JERKS
ON DATES?

02:47.934 --> 02:50.367
IF YOU REALLY FEEL
THAT ALL GUYS WANNA DO
IS GO TOO FAR,

02:50.367 --> 02:51.934
THEN WHY GO OUT
WITH THEM AT ALL?

02:53.700 --> 02:56.300
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'M DONE.

02:56.300 --> 02:58.033
WAY TO BE SENSITIVE,
SHAWN.

02:58.033 --> 03:00.500
YEAH, IT REALLY
PAYS TO BE HONEST
WITH A GIRL.

03:01.934 --> 03:04.133
IS IT JUST ME...

03:04.133 --> 03:05.667
OR IS IT JUST ME?

03:08.734 --> 03:10.133
TO RESEARCH HIS BOOK,
<i>BLACK LIKE ME,</i>

03:10.133 --> 03:13.500
AUTHOR JOHN GRIFFIN,
A WHITE MAN,

03:13.500 --> 03:17.900
HAD HIS SKIN PIGMENT
TEMPORARILY DARKENED

03:17.900 --> 03:20.000
SO THAT HE COULD
EXPERIENCE LIFE

03:20.000 --> 03:23.133
THROUGH THE PERSPECTIVE
OF A BLACK MAN.

03:23.133 --> 03:26.600
WOULDN'T IT
HAVE BEEN EASIER
TO JUST...ASK?

03:30.300 --> 03:34.033
WELL, THERE WAS SUCH
DISTRUST BETWEEN THE RACES

03:34.033 --> 03:38.100
THAT GRIFFIN FELT THAT
ONLY BY BECOMING BLACK

03:38.100 --> 03:42.500
COULD HE BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND
THE HORRORS OF SEGREGATION.

03:42.500 --> 03:44.500
CORY, THAT'S
YOUR NEXT STORY.

03:44.500 --> 03:45.600
WHAT?

03:45.600 --> 03:47.300
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT GIRLS
ARE TALKING ABOUT,

03:47.300 --> 03:51.767
YOU EXPERIENCE THE WORLD
FROM A GIRL'S POINT OF VIEW...

03:51.767 --> 03:54.000
BY BECOMING A GIRL.

03:55.300 --> 03:57.367
THAT'S CRAZY TALK.

03:57.367 --> 03:58.567
NO, NO, NO.
YOU DRESS UP
LIKE A GIRL

03:58.567 --> 04:00.233
AND WRITE ABOUT IT.

04:00.233 --> 04:02.400
"CHICK LIKE ME."

04:02.400 --> 04:06.400
THAT'S MEANINGFUL.
YOU'RE WRITING
A REAL ARTICLE,

04:06.400 --> 04:08.734
NOT JUST SOME...
SILLY COLUMN.

04:08.734 --> 04:10.400
IT IS NOT
A SILLY COLUMN.

04:10.400 --> 04:12.300
YES, IT IS.

04:12.300 --> 04:15.133
OK, MR. FEENY.
WHAT HAPPENED TO
THIS GUY GRIFFIN

04:15.133 --> 04:16.400
AFTER HE
WROTE HIS BOOK?

04:16.400 --> 04:19.200
HE SOLD
5 MILLION COPIES

04:19.200 --> 04:21.567
AND WON IMMEDIATE
WORLD RENOWN.

04:21.567 --> 04:23.500
WHY DO YOU ASK,
MR. MATTHEWS?

04:23.500 --> 04:25.000
MISS MATTHEWS.

04:26.400 --> 04:27.700
WHAT?

04:27.700 --> 04:29.133
NOTHING.

04:31.133 --> 04:33.100
THIS IS THE DOME 2000.

04:33.100 --> 04:34.800
WHEN YOU GET TO THE TOP
OF THE MOUNTAIN

04:34.800 --> 04:36.100
AND THAT WIND
STARTS TO BLOWIN',

04:36.100 --> 04:38.800
YOU'LL BE REAL GLAD
YOU GOT THIS
OVER YOUR HEAD.

04:38.800 --> 04:40.600
I'LL REMEMBER
WHO SOLD IT TO ME, TOO.

04:40.600 --> 04:41.967
I HOPE YOU DO.
THAT WAY,

04:41.967 --> 04:45.300
YOU CAN REMEMBER ME
FOR ALL YOUR FUTURE
WILDERNESS NEEDS.

04:45.300 --> 04:49.800
LISTEN, UM...
I IMAGINE YOU PROBABLY
GET THIS A LOT,

04:49.800 --> 04:51.100
BUT YOU SEEM AWFULLY NICE.

04:51.100 --> 04:53.000
YOU WANNA GO GET
A CUP OF COFFEE
SOMETIME.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.033
YOU SEEM MIGHTY NICE,
TOO, BUT...

04:56.033 --> 04:57.600
I'M NOT MUCH
OF A COFFEE DRINKER.

04:57.600 --> 04:58.934
THAT'S OK.

04:58.934 --> 05:00.667
WE COULD
DO SOMETHIN' ELSE.

05:00.667 --> 05:02.133
ANYTHING.

05:02.133 --> 05:03.800
THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

05:03.800 --> 05:05.900
WHY DON'T YA
COME OVER TO MY PLACE,

05:05.900 --> 05:08.867
AND I'LL COOK YA
A BIG OL' DINNER.
HOW ABOUT TONIGHT?

05:08.867 --> 05:11.567
REALLY? THAT WOULD BE--
WOW.

05:11.567 --> 05:13.767
OH, GREAT.
AND AFTER DINNER,

05:13.767 --> 05:15.667
THAT'S WHEN
THE REAL FUN STARTS.

05:15.667 --> 05:17.100
I'M ALWAYS UP
FOR A LITTLE FUN.

05:17.100 --> 05:18.967
GOOD, BECAUSE WE RUB OIL
ALL OVER OUR BODIES--

05:18.967 --> 05:20.233
I LIKE THAT.

05:20.233 --> 05:21.500
GO JUMPIN'
IN THE COLD RIVER...

05:21.500 --> 05:23.800
WHAT?
AND GO EEL GRABBIN'.

05:23.800 --> 05:25.867
WHAT?
IT'S FUN, GREAT FUN.

05:25.867 --> 05:29.467
AND FOR THE EELS, TOO,
UNLESS THEIR HEADS
BREAK OFF.

05:29.467 --> 05:31.600
SO, UH,
WHAT TIME TONIGHT?

05:31.600 --> 05:34.767
UH, TONIGHT--TONIGHT'S
REALLY NOT GOOD FOR ME.

05:34.767 --> 05:35.867
I'VE GOT
ANOTHER APPOINTMENT

05:35.867 --> 05:37.900
WHICH DOESN'T
ACTUALLY INVOLVE EELS.

05:37.900 --> 05:40.133
OH, COME ON, DAVE.
WHERE'S YOUR
SENSE OF ADVENTURE?

05:40.133 --> 05:42.233
YOU KNOW, I'LL JUST
TAKE THE TENT.

05:42.233 --> 05:44.033
OHH...

05:44.033 --> 05:47.400
IN FACT,
YOU KEEP THE TENT,
AND WHAT I'M GONNA DO

05:47.400 --> 05:48.667
IS...LEAVE.

05:48.667 --> 05:51.834
WAIT. W-WELL, I WAS
JUST TRYIN' TO BE...

05:51.834 --> 05:53.133
FRIENDLY.

05:57.300 --> 05:59.400
ERIC, IS THERE SOMETHIN'
THE MATTER WITH ME?

05:59.400 --> 06:02.500
ERIC, IS THERE SOMETHIN'
THE MATTER WITH ME?

06:02.500 --> 06:04.500
I'M LOOKIN'.

06:04.500 --> 06:08.700
NO. I MEAN, WHY AM I
ALWAYS SCARIN' BOYS OFF?

06:08.700 --> 06:11.667
WELL,
YOU DON'T HAVE A LOT
OF SOCIAL EXPERIENCE

06:11.667 --> 06:12.800
WITH MEN, DO YA?

06:12.800 --> 06:14.367
NO, NOT CITY MEN.

06:14.367 --> 06:15.667
DIDN'T YA
DATE ANY GUYS

06:15.667 --> 06:17.000
BACK THERE
IN THE MOUNTAINS?

06:17.000 --> 06:19.834
SURE. WE'D
GO OUT IN THE WOODS
AND SHOOT THINGS.

06:19.834 --> 06:22.467
OH, SO YA
LIKE HUNTING?

06:22.467 --> 06:24.100
ALL RIGHT.
HERE'S A QUESTION
FOR YA.

06:24.100 --> 06:27.300
WHEN YOU SEE A CUTE
LITTLE FUZZY ANIMAL
THAT YOU LIKE,

06:27.300 --> 06:29.600
THAT YOU KNOW
YOU LIKE TO SHOOT,

06:29.600 --> 06:30.800
DO YOU GO
RUNNING UP TO IT,

06:30.800 --> 06:33.233
YELLING AND WAVING
YOUR RIFLE
IN THE AIR?

06:33.233 --> 06:35.200
WELL, NO.
AND WHY NOT?

06:35.200 --> 06:38.900
'CAUSE IT WILL SCARE
THE LITTLE CRITTER OFF.

06:38.900 --> 06:42.100
OH. OH,
SO YOU'RE SAYIN'
MY BEHAVIOR

06:42.100 --> 06:43.967
IS SCARIN'
THESE CITY MEN.

06:43.967 --> 06:45.600
JUST A SMIDGE.

06:47.500 --> 06:49.834
I HAVE TO LEARN HOW
TO HUNT AND TRACK
THESE BOYS.

06:49.834 --> 06:51.033
MM-HMM.

06:51.033 --> 06:54.100
WELL, I'M GONNA NEED
A CITY MAN TO PRACTICE ON.

06:58.500 --> 06:59.934
HEY, GUYS.

06:59.934 --> 07:01.600
HI, SON. HOW WAS YOUR DAY?
FINE.

07:01.600 --> 07:03.000
WHAT'D YOU DO IN SCHOOL?
NOTHIN'.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.567
HOLD ON. WAIT THERE.

07:05.567 --> 07:08.500
YOU KNOW, EVERY DAY,
I ASK YOU WHAT DID YOU DO,

07:08.500 --> 07:10.133
AND EVERY DAY,
YOU TELL ME NOTHING.

07:10.133 --> 07:12.000
I'M TIRED OF NOTHING.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.767
WE BOTH KNOW SOMETHING
HAPPENED TODAY,

07:13.767 --> 07:15.600
AND I WANNA KNOW
WHAT IT IS.

07:15.600 --> 07:17.700
I DECIDED
TO BE A GIRL.

07:22.033 --> 07:25.700
WELL, YOU TAUGHT ME
A VERY VALUABLE LESSON
THERE, SON.

07:27.600 --> 07:29.567
YOU KNOW THE BOOK
<i>BLACK LIKE ME?</i>

07:29.567 --> 07:31.700
SURE,
IS THAT WHAT YOU GUYS
ARE READIN' IN SCHOOL?

07:31.700 --> 07:34.200
DON'T ASK QUESTIONS, HONEY.

07:34.200 --> 07:36.700
CORY'S GONNA
WRITE<i>CHICK LIKE ME</i>
FOR THE SCHOOL NEWSPAPER.

07:36.700 --> 07:38.800
HE'S GONNA EXPERIENCE LIFE
FROM A GIRL'S POINT OF VIEW

07:38.800 --> 07:41.000
BY DRESSING UP LIKE A GIRL.

07:44.033 --> 07:46.000
NO, DON'T WANT YA TO.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.300
OH, COME ON.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.667
I THINK IT WOULD BE
A WONDERFUL
LEARNING EXPERIENCE.

07:48.667 --> 07:50.367
IT COULD
SERVE HIM WELL

07:50.367 --> 07:52.500
FOR THE REST
OF HIS LIFE.

07:52.500 --> 07:55.000
WHAT'S IN HERE,
COR--

07:57.500 --> 08:00.600
IT'S A MIRACLE BRA.

08:00.600 --> 08:03.900
IT'S A MIRACLE BRA,
HONEY. GET A CAMERA.

08:03.900 --> 08:05.600
I'M NOT DRESSING UP
LIKE A GIRL

08:05.600 --> 08:08.100
JUST FOR THE SAKE
OF DRESSING UP
LIKE A GIRL.

08:08.100 --> 08:10.400
I'M A JOURNALIST,
DAGNABBIT.

08:12.500 --> 08:14.033
HI, TOPANGA.
HI.

08:14.033 --> 08:17.000
SHAWN, I MIGHT'VE
BEEN A BIT PROTECTIVE
OF DEBBIE THIS MORNING,

08:17.000 --> 08:19.734
AND I DIDN'T
FULLY CONSIDER
YOUR POINT OF VIEW.

08:19.734 --> 08:22.667
I NEVER KNEW I HAD
A POINT OF VIEW.

08:22.667 --> 08:25.100
TOPANGA, EVERYTHING'S
WORKED OUT FOR THE BEST

08:25.100 --> 08:27.200
BECAUSE I'VE DECIDED
TO BE A GIRL

08:27.200 --> 08:28.867
AND SEE WHAT
IT'S REALLY LIKE.

08:28.867 --> 08:31.367
NOT IN THAT DRESS,
YOU'RE NOT.

08:31.367 --> 08:34.734
THAT'S WHY
I WAS COUNTING ON
YOUR EXPERT ASSISTANCE

08:34.734 --> 08:38.834
TO HELP IN SELECTING
THE PROPER FEMALE
ACCOUTERMENTS.

08:38.834 --> 08:40.800
YOU WANT ME
TO DRESS YOU UP
LIKE A GIRL?

08:40.800 --> 08:43.800
YEAH, TOPANGA.
MAKE CORY PRETTY.

08:46.934 --> 08:48.233
COOL.

08:48.233 --> 08:51.700
CORY? SWEETIE,
YOU HAVE TO COME OUT
EVENTUALLY.

08:51.700 --> 08:54.467
DON'T WANNA.
SECOND THOUGHTS.

08:54.467 --> 08:56.400
COME ON OUT.
WE WON'T LAUGH.

08:56.400 --> 08:58.200
YOU'RE NOT SEEIN'
WHAT I'M SEEIN'.

08:59.600 --> 09:01.033
HEY, COR,
COME ON, BUDDY.

09:01.033 --> 09:03.567
YOU'RE GONNA
WRITE AN ARTICLE
THAT MEANS SOMETHING.

09:03.567 --> 09:05.834
YOU'RE GONNA
MAKE A DIFFERENCE,
NOT ONLY IN OUR LIVES,

09:05.834 --> 09:07.934
BUT IN THE LIVES
OF GUYS AND GIRLS
EVERYWHERE.

09:07.934 --> 09:10.867
YOU'RE NOT SEEIN'
WHAT I'M SEEIN.

09:10.867 --> 09:13.400
COME ON, COR.
HOW BAD A GIRL
COULD YOU BE?

09:23.200 --> 09:24.233
OK, BAD.

09:24.233 --> 09:25.233
HOW BAD?

09:25.233 --> 09:26.500
BAD-BAD.

09:27.800 --> 09:29.934
I KNEW IT.
I LOOK...

09:29.934 --> 09:31.600
I LOOK FAT.

09:33.400 --> 09:36.300
FAT IS THE LEAST
OF YOUR PROBLEMS,
BABY.

09:36.300 --> 09:37.734
TOPANGA...

09:39.867 --> 09:42.200
MAYBE IT'S JUST NOT
A GOOD COLOR FOR YOU.

09:44.600 --> 09:45.667
B-WAA.

09:45.667 --> 09:47.567
COME ON, YOU GUYS.
WE CAN DO THIS.

09:47.567 --> 09:49.500
IT'S JUST ALL HOW
YOU PRESENT YOURSELF.

09:49.500 --> 09:51.667
NOW, LET'S SEE HOW
YOU PRESENT YOURSELF.

09:51.667 --> 09:52.667
OK.

10:03.400 --> 10:04.867
WAS THAT ALL RIGHT?

10:04.867 --> 10:08.500
NOT EVEN
ON A DESERT ISLAND.

10:08.500 --> 10:09.767
INSTRUCTIVE, SHAWN.

10:09.767 --> 10:12.033
COR, YOU'RE MISSING
THE OBVIOUS.

10:12.033 --> 10:13.967
GIRLS
JUST GLIDE MORE.

10:13.967 --> 10:14.967
THEY'RE
MORE AT EASE.

10:14.967 --> 10:16.834
YOU GOTTA
KIND OF LET IT FLOW.

10:16.834 --> 10:19.000
THAT'S PRETTY
RIGHT ON THE NOSE
THERE.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.400
GIRLS ARE MY AREA.
I LIKE GIRLS.

10:21.400 --> 10:23.834
OK, THEN SHOW ME,
SHAWN. SHOW ME.

10:23.834 --> 10:25.100
WHAT'S TO SHOW?
HERE.

10:31.967 --> 10:33.700
WHAT?

10:33.700 --> 10:36.200
OH, NO. NO.
NO, NO, NO.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.734
WHY IS
EVERYBODY STARING?

10:52.734 --> 10:54.200
WHAT ARE
THEY LOOKING AT?

10:54.200 --> 10:56.400
I DON'T WANT YA
TO TAKE THIS
THE WRONG WAY,

10:56.400 --> 10:58.934
BUT...YOU'RE
KIND OF A BABE.

10:58.934 --> 11:00.400
REALLY?

11:00.400 --> 11:01.900
YEAH.

11:01.900 --> 11:06.867
YOU WANT ME TO, LIKE,
CARRY YOUR BOOKS FOR YOU?

11:06.867 --> 11:08.867
I GET THAT?
YEAH, THANKS.

11:13.300 --> 11:16.033
WHY ARE YOU
CARRYING HIS BOOKS?

11:16.033 --> 11:18.300
WE'RE TRYING
TO CREATE THE ILLUSION
THAT SHAWN'S A GIRL,

11:18.300 --> 11:20.667
SO I THOUGHT
THIS WOULD HELP.

11:20.667 --> 11:22.033
YOU NEVER
CARRY MY BOOKS.

11:22.033 --> 11:23.500
WELL, LOOK AT HIM.

11:27.500 --> 11:29.934
AND LOOK AT YOU.

11:29.934 --> 11:32.500
YOU ARE
JUST RADIANT TODAY.

11:32.500 --> 11:35.400
SHAWN, HOW DOES
IT FEEL TO BE
WEARING PANTY HOSE?

11:35.400 --> 11:36.467
NOT SHAWN.

11:36.467 --> 11:37.834
HE NEEDS
A GIRL'S NAME.

11:37.834 --> 11:40.500
OK, THIS IS EASY.
HOW ABOUT JANET?

11:40.500 --> 11:42.200
NO, NO, NO, NOT JANET.

11:42.200 --> 11:43.834
WHAT POSSIBLE DIFFERENCE
COULD IT MAKE?

11:43.834 --> 11:47.200
CORY...YOU'VE
THOUGHT ABOUT THIS
BEFORE, HAVEN'T YOU?

11:47.200 --> 11:48.400
A LITTLE.

11:48.400 --> 11:50.100
AND WHAT NAME
HAVE YOU
THOUGHT ABOUT?

11:50.100 --> 11:52.400
WELL...

11:52.400 --> 11:54.200
VERONICA.

11:59.400 --> 12:01.700
VERONICA
IS A LOVELY NAME.

12:01.700 --> 12:05.200
GOOD MORNING, MISS LAWRENCE.
MR. MATTHEWS. MR. HUNTER.

12:17.200 --> 12:19.100
IF THERE'S ANYTHING
YOU NEED TO TALK ABOUT,

12:19.100 --> 12:22.867
MY DOOR IS ALWAYS OPEN.
I'M NOT HERE TO JUDGE.

12:22.867 --> 12:25.300
IT'S FOR AN ARTICLE
WE'RE WRITING, MR. FEENY.

12:25.300 --> 12:27.600
I AM NOT HERE TO JUDGE.

12:30.300 --> 12:32.567
OK, GUYS,
TARGET'S APPROACHING.

12:32.567 --> 12:35.200
10 YARDS...5 YARDS...

12:35.200 --> 12:36.467

12:36.467 --> 12:38.600
HI, GARY. DEBBIE SAID

12:38.600 --> 12:41.033

A NICE TIME.

12:41.033 --> 12:44.000
HI THERE.
UM...

12:44.000 --> 12:45.233
I'M GARY.

12:45.233 --> 12:48.800
GARY,
THIS IS VERONICA,

12:48.800 --> 12:50.900
VERONICA...

12:52.000 --> 12:53.233
WASBOYSKI.

12:57.667 --> 12:59.400
YOU KNOW,
I HAVE NEVER
SEEN YOU BEFORE.

12:59.400 --> 13:01.567
YOU NEW IN SCHOOL?

13:01.567 --> 13:05.233
YEP. I'M JUST
A WHOLE NEW PERSON.

13:05.233 --> 13:07.300
LISTEN, UH..
IF YOU WANT,

13:07.300 --> 13:12.667
I'D BE HAPPY
TO, UH, YOU KNOW,
TAKE YA TO CHUBBIE'S,

13:12.667 --> 13:15.133
TELL YA
WHAT TEACHERS TO AVOID,
THAT KIND OF STUFF...

13:15.133 --> 13:17.100
UNLESS YOUR BOYFRIEND
ALREADY DID THAT.

13:17.100 --> 13:21.100
OH, NO, GARY. THIS ONE
IS DEFINITELY AVAILABLE.

13:21.100 --> 13:23.567
CORY, I CAN
SPEAK FOR MYSELF.

13:23.567 --> 13:26.734
WELL, THEN YOU
JUST DO THAT,
VER-ON-ICA.

13:29.400 --> 13:31.000
THAT'D BE GREAT.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.033
SO, SATURDAY--
IS THAT GOOD
FOR BOTH OF YOU?

13:33.033 --> 13:35.200
SATURDAY'S
MY DATE NIGHT.

13:35.200 --> 13:36.200
IT STILL IS.

13:36.200 --> 13:38.967
OK, SATURDAY.

13:40.600 --> 13:42.300
I'LL GIVE UP
A SATURDAY.

13:42.300 --> 13:44.667
WELL, I'LL SEE YOU THEN.

13:46.200 --> 13:48.200
SHAWNY, WAY TO GO.

13:48.200 --> 13:50.100
YOU GOT THE DATE.

13:50.500 --> 13:51.600
WHAT?

13:51.600 --> 13:53.734
I HAVE
NOTHING TO WEAR.

13:59.934 --> 14:01.467
ALL RIGHT, LONNIE.
NOW...

14:01.467 --> 14:02.900
LET'S SAY
WE'RE AT A CLUB.

14:02.900 --> 14:05.300
LET'S SAY
THAT I'M DAVE,

14:05.300 --> 14:06.300
AND I'M STANDING
HERE AT THE BAR,

14:06.300 --> 14:07.767
AND YOU SEE ME
FROM ACROSS
THE ROOM,

14:07.767 --> 14:09.200
AND YOU
SAY TO YOURSELF...

14:09.200 --> 14:11.000
I WANT THAT ONE.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.100
NO, NO, NO, NO.

14:12.100 --> 14:13.800
REMEMBER HUNTING?
REMEMBER
THE BOY BUNNIES?

14:13.800 --> 14:14.767
YOU DON'T WANNA
SCARE 'EM AWAY.

14:14.767 --> 14:16.000
THEY'LL BE NOTHING
LEFT TO HUNT.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.100
THAT'S NO FUN.

14:17.100 --> 14:18.900
NO, IT'S NOT. HERE'S
WHAT YOU GOTTA DO.

14:18.900 --> 14:20.133
YOU GOTTA
APPROACH ME

14:20.133 --> 14:21.300
WITHOUT
BEING DETECTED.

14:26.934 --> 14:29.500
YOU STAND NEXT TO ME,
BUT NOT CLOSE ENOUGH

14:29.500 --> 14:31.800
TO MAKE ME REALIZE
THAT I'M YOUR PREY.

14:33.100 --> 14:34.000
NOW
TURN TO ME.

14:35.100 --> 14:37.000
MAKE
EYE CONTACT.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
SMILE.

14:39.500 --> 14:40.867
AND THEN SAY...

14:40.867 --> 14:44.367
I WANT THAT ONE.

14:44.367 --> 14:46.700
I ADMIRE
YOUR SINGLE-MINDEDNESS,
BUT NO.

14:46.700 --> 14:49.000
WHAT GUYS REALLY LIKE
IS A COMPLIMENT.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.200
GIVE US
A GREAT COMPLIMENT,

14:50.200 --> 14:51.600
WE'RE YOURS FOR
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

14:54.300 --> 14:56.667
THAT IS
THE NICEST SHIRT.

14:56.667 --> 15:00.867
I'D LOVE TO GET ONE
JUST LIKE THAT
FOR MY BROTHER BUCK.

15:00.867 --> 15:01.900
WHO MAKES THAT?

15:01.900 --> 15:03.400
SOME SHIRT GUY.

15:03.400 --> 15:04.600
CAN I LOOK?

15:04.600 --> 15:07.967
OH, I CAN'T
SEEM TO FIND
THE LABEL.

15:07.967 --> 15:10.000
IS IT SOMEPLACE ELSE?

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
COULD BE ANYWHERE.
I WOULDN'T STOP LOOKING.

15:14.600 --> 15:16.700
OH, YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M DOIN'?

15:16.700 --> 15:18.934
JUST WHAT GOD
INTENDED?

15:18.934 --> 15:21.767
NO. I'M BEIN'
TOO FRIENDLY AGAIN,

15:21.767 --> 15:24.000
AND YOU WERE JUST ABOUT
TO TELL ME THAT,
WEREN'T YA?

15:24.000 --> 15:26.900
YEAH, I WAS
GONNA GET TO THAT
EVENTUALLY.

15:26.900 --> 15:29.500
YOU KNOW, I NEVER
WOULD'VE THOUGHT
THAT BEIN' FRIENDLY

15:29.500 --> 15:31.367
COULD DRIVE PEOPLE AWAY.

15:31.367 --> 15:33.767
BUT I GUESS FRIENDLINESS
IS JUST DIFFERENT

15:33.767 --> 15:35.200
BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN.

15:35.200 --> 15:38.467
YEAH, I GUESS IT IS.

15:38.467 --> 15:40.233
YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M GONNA DO?

15:40.233 --> 15:42.300
I'M GONNA STEP BACK
A RESPECTABLE DISTANCE
HERE,

15:42.300 --> 15:45.133
AND I'M JUST
GONNA SAY HELLO.

15:45.133 --> 15:48.233
HELLO. MY NAME
IS LONNIE BODEN,

15:48.233 --> 15:50.467
AND I WILL DO
WHATEVER I CAN

15:50.467 --> 15:52.600
NOT TO PHYSICALLY INVADE
YOUR PERSONAL SPACE.

15:52.600 --> 15:56.767
PERHAPS WE CAN
DISCUSS OUR CAREER GOALS
OVER A GRAPE NEHI.

15:56.767 --> 16:00.200
HA HA HA.
WHAT HAVE I DONE?

16:04.467 --> 16:07.200
THIS HAS BEEN
A TERRIFIC EVENING,

16:07.200 --> 16:09.567
AND YOU ARE
JUST GREAT.

16:09.567 --> 16:11.800
AND SO...
I'M WONDERIN'...

16:11.800 --> 16:13.200
HOW IS IT THAT
SOMEONE LIKE YOU

16:13.200 --> 16:14.500
DOESN'T HAVE
A BOYFRIEND?

16:14.500 --> 16:17.700
I--I HAVEN'T
REALLY BEEN LOOKING
FOR A BOYFRIEND,

16:17.700 --> 16:21.200
'CAUSE I JUST BEEN
GOING THROUGH
A LOT OF CHANGES.

16:21.200 --> 16:24.934
LISTEN, ANY TIME
YOU WANNA TALK,

16:24.934 --> 16:26.500
I'M HERE TO LISTEN.

16:26.500 --> 16:30.800
THANKS. THAT'S--
THAT'S NICE, GARY.

16:30.800 --> 16:33.367
I GOTTA HAVE
SOME FOOD.

16:33.367 --> 16:37.100
OH, YOU GOT IT.
WAITRESS!

16:42.400 --> 16:44.467
[HUSKY VOICE]
HOW YA DOIN', HONEY?

16:46.767 --> 16:48.233
CORY?

16:48.233 --> 16:51.967
I'M CORA. I'LL BE YOUR
WAITRESS THIS EVENIN'.

16:51.967 --> 16:53.600
YOU KNOW,
I COME IN HERE
A LOT,

16:53.600 --> 16:55.667
AND I'VE NEVER
SEEN YOU BEFORE.

16:55.667 --> 16:57.600
QUIT HITTIN' ON ME.

16:57.600 --> 16:59.033
HA HA HA.

17:00.367 --> 17:02.700
I'M JUST KIDDIN'.
IT'S MY FIRST NIGHT.

17:02.700 --> 17:07.033
BESIDES, IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE ALREADY TAKEN,
CUTIE.

17:07.033 --> 17:10.200
YOU'RE INSANE.

17:10.200 --> 17:11.600
MAY I TAKE YOUR ORDER,
BABY?

17:11.600 --> 17:13.467
MY USUAL--

17:13.467 --> 17:17.100
A DOUBLE CHILIBURGER
AND ONE CHOCOLATE
MILK SHAKE

17:17.100 --> 17:18.500
AND 2 STRAWS.

17:18.500 --> 17:21.133
I'LL HAVE THE SAME
AND A STEAK.

17:22.300 --> 17:23.567
WHAT?

17:23.567 --> 17:26.200
WELL, AREN'T YOU
THE VORACIOUS
LITTLE EATER.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.300
HI, BABE.

17:33.300 --> 17:35.600
SO, YOU HAVIN'
A GOOD TIME?

17:35.600 --> 17:38.400
A LITTLE TROUBLE
BREATHING.

17:38.400 --> 17:39.867
YOU'RE CROWDING ME
A BIT.

17:39.867 --> 17:42.000
OH, MAYBE
YOU'RE JUST TENSE.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.734
HOW ABOUT I RUB
YOUR SHOULDERS?

17:43.734 --> 17:46.400
YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T
ASK YOU TO DO THAT.

17:46.400 --> 17:48.400
YEAH, BUT DOESN'T IT
FEEL GOOD?

17:48.400 --> 17:50.967
YOU'RE NOT
LISTENING TO ME.

17:50.967 --> 17:53.300
WHOA, YOU'RE
A STRONG ONE.

17:53.300 --> 17:56.100
YEAH, I PLAY A LITTLE
FIELD HOCKEY.

17:56.100 --> 17:57.500
YEAH, I KNEW THAT,

17:57.500 --> 17:59.600
BECAUSE THE
FIRST THING I NOTICED
WERE YOUR LEGS.

17:59.600 --> 18:01.367
AAH!
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

18:01.367 --> 18:02.834
YOU JUST DON'T LISTEN.

18:02.834 --> 18:06.600
YOU'RE TOO BUSY
PLANNING YOUR NEXT MOVE
TO HEAR US SAY NO.

18:06.600 --> 18:07.667
WHAT?

18:10.700 --> 18:11.767
HEY, WHERE YOU GOIN'?

18:11.767 --> 18:13.834
HE TOUCHED ME.
WHERE?

18:13.834 --> 18:15.233
ON MY KNEE.

18:15.233 --> 18:17.233
IT'S MY KNEE.
WHAT MAKES HIM THINK
THAT IT'S HIS KNEE?

18:17.233 --> 18:18.834
MAYBE YOU SENT HIM
A SIGNAL.

18:18.834 --> 18:20.800
THE ONLY SIGNAL
I SENT HIM
WAS "STOP IT."

18:20.800 --> 18:21.867
AND HE DIDN'T LISTEN.

18:21.867 --> 18:23.200
I'M NOT LIKE THAT.

18:24.500 --> 18:25.500
I'M NOT.

18:25.500 --> 18:27.567
I NEVER
WILL BE AGAIN.

18:27.567 --> 18:30.133
HERE HE COMES.
NO, NO. I QUIT.

18:30.133 --> 18:31.967
YOU CAN'T. WE HAVE
AN ARTICLE TO FINISH.

18:31.967 --> 18:33.600
I SHOULD'VE WORN
A PANTSUIT.

18:35.233 --> 18:39.033
LOOK, UH, SORRY I GOT
A LITTLE AGGRESSIVE.

18:39.033 --> 18:42.500
NOBODY RESPECTS WOMEN
MORE THAN ME.

18:42.500 --> 18:43.667
YOU FORGIVE ME?

18:43.667 --> 18:44.967
OF COURSE
SHE FORGIVES YOU.

18:44.967 --> 18:47.133
YOU TWO ARE JUST
ADORABLE TOGETHER.

18:47.133 --> 18:49.934
ISN'T HE JUST DELISH?

18:49.934 --> 18:52.900
TELL YOU WHAT--
HOW ABOUT I TEACH YOU
HOW TO PLAY FOOSBALL?

18:54.000 --> 18:56.700
HOW ABOUT I TEACH YOU?

18:56.700 --> 18:59.300
YEAH, RIGHT.

19:00.500 --> 19:03.200
MY HOSIERY
IS BUNCHING.

19:06.600 --> 19:08.834
NOW, UH,
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO

19:08.834 --> 19:10.900
IS YOU WANNA
SPIN THAT HANDLE,

19:10.900 --> 19:15.800
AND YOU WANNA MAKE
THIS LITTLE GUY...
KICK THE BALL.

19:15.800 --> 19:17.467
LIKE THIS?

19:19.200 --> 19:22.100
YEAH...KIND OF LIKE THAT.

19:22.100 --> 19:23.767
I CAN GO
A LITTLE EASIER
IF YOU WANT.

19:23.767 --> 19:25.367
JUST TAKE YOUR NEXT SHOT.

19:28.800 --> 19:30.100
OH, NICE BLOCK.

19:30.100 --> 19:32.800
OH, YOU LIKED THAT?
LET ME SHOW YOU
HOW I DID IT.

19:38.367 --> 19:40.000
NOW, WHAT YOU
NEED TO HAVE

19:40.000 --> 19:42.200
IS A REAL LIGHT
TOUCH.

19:42.200 --> 19:44.100
HEY, HEY.

19:44.100 --> 19:45.700
HEY, WHAT?

19:45.700 --> 19:47.767
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

19:47.767 --> 19:50.567
I'M JUST SHOWIN' YOU
HOW TO PLAY THE GAME.

19:50.567 --> 19:51.934
I KNOW HOW TO PLAY
THE GAME.

19:51.934 --> 19:54.700
YEAH, I COULD TELL
BY THE WAY
YOU'RE DRESSED.

19:54.700 --> 19:57.867
I JUST WANTED
TO LOOK NICE.

19:57.867 --> 19:59.600
WELL, YOU DO.

19:59.600 --> 20:01.700
I SAID DON'T TOUCH ME.

20:01.700 --> 20:04.233

THAT YOU'D BE INTO GUYS.

20:09.900 --> 20:12.567

21:28.667 --> 21:32.400
AND A GENUINE CONNECTION
WITH ANOTHER HUMAN BEING?

21:33.600 --> 21:35.000
