13:22.958 --> 13:24.958
[music fades]

13:26.833 --> 13:29.041
[chuckles] You must've fished
in a past life.

13:30.291 --> 13:31.250
Only sharks.

13:31.250 --> 13:32.541
[both laugh]

13:33.958 --> 13:34.833
What about you?

13:34.833 --> 13:38.500
Do you have any old love stories
funnier than mine?

13:38.500 --> 13:40.708
Well, in fact, it's a very short list.

13:42.666 --> 13:44.375
There was one that hit me hard.

13:45.541 --> 13:47.875
Even kissing her was almost impossible.

13:48.458 --> 13:50.416
What, was she a nun?

13:50.916 --> 13:52.583
[both laugh]

13:52.583 --> 13:55.458
Let me guess. You met her in kindergarten.

13:55.458 --> 13:56.458
Close.

13:57.458 --> 14:00.750
We met in the courtyard
of juvenile detention.

14:01.333 --> 14:04.125
She was in the girls' wing,
and I was in the boys'.

14:05.458 --> 14:07.166
So how'd you get together?

14:07.166 --> 14:09.791
[chuckles] We joined the choir.

14:10.583 --> 14:14.416
We'd be in the back row,
and we'd drop the music and slip away.

14:14.416 --> 14:16.458
[chuckles softly]

14:16.458 --> 14:18.750
We'd find a place to hide
and make out like crazy.

14:19.333 --> 14:22.291
While everyone else
sang ''Adeste Fideles.''

14:22.916 --> 14:25.250
And getting caught
was all part of the fun.

14:26.083 --> 14:28.541
I guess you have a thing
for forbidden fruit.

14:30.291 --> 14:31.500
Maybe a little.

14:32.750 --> 14:36.125
Well, to be completely honest,
I'd have joined the choir.

14:36.125 --> 14:37.791
[gentle music playing]

14:43.708 --> 14:45.125

15:22.291 --> 15:24.041
This is the best lead we have.

15:24.541 --> 15:26.458
And what about these?

15:26.458 --> 15:29.583
The police sketch?
Between you and me, this is garbage.

15:29.583 --> 15:32.375
It's a vague recollection
and abstract. Mm?

15:32.375 --> 15:35.458
They described it to some random artist
who works at the station.

15:35.458 --> 15:36.500
Let's be serious.

15:36.500 --> 15:38.333
Those guys draw
whatever they fucking please

15:38.333 --> 15:40.833
and then have the balls to give it to me!
[taps desk]

15:40.833 --> 15:42.750
All we have is this goat here.

15:42.750 --> 15:45.166

with the tattoo has a record.

15:45.166 --> 15:47.625
- [line ringing]
- [Sierra] Hello?

15:47.625 --> 15:50.500
I need to speak with
the Criminal Investigation Unit in Spain.

15:50.500 --> 15:51.500
Immediately.

15:53.625 --> 15:54.625
Oh!

15:55.625 --> 15:57.833
Do you know what it means?
The horned goat?

15:58.458 --> 16:00.083
Evil. Satanic.

16:00.875 --> 16:02.916
There's a famous Goya painting.

16:02.916 --> 16:04.750
- Do you know it?
- [chuckles]

16:04.750 --> 16:06.458
I don't seem to remember that one.

16:06.458 --> 16:07.875
Of course.

16:07.875 --> 16:10.833
I mean, you guys... You have the Louvre.

16:10.833 --> 16:12.416
But we have the Prado.

16:13.333 --> 16:14.208
[both chuckle]

16:14.208 --> 16:18.625
There's no denying, the <i>Mona Lisa

[scoffs] So much cuter.

16:21.541 --> 16:22.875

16:22.875 --> 16:25.166

16:25.833 --> 16:27.125
- Ah--
- [hushes]

No, not at all.

16:49.500 --> 16:52.208
You see, I'm working on
a girls' night out in Paris.

16:52.875 --> 16:54.291
That sounds like a good plan.

16:54.291 --> 16:57.708
I'm with this French girl

- When?

17:07.833 --> 17:08.958

Hey, sweetie. Any news from François?

17:31.750 --> 17:34.000
No, no. Nothing yet.

17:35.708 --> 17:37.833
Are you all right?
I can leave Pablo at the club.

17:37.833 --> 17:39.375
The audition's just for two hours.

17:39.375 --> 17:42.291
Uh... no, no, that's not it.

17:44.250 --> 17:46.250
Do you remember
the Spanish guy from the club?

17:47.041 --> 17:49.750
Well, you see... we're together.

We talked.

And... he accepts it.

You're right. I <i>can't</i> imagine it.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.208
You don't find it weird?

18:40.208 --> 18:43.166
I mean, that guy visiting François?

18:43.666 --> 18:45.541
No, no. I invited him.

18:46.416 --> 18:49.166
- Oh.
- Simón has lent us money for a lawyer.

18:49.166 --> 18:50.708
The best one in Paris.

18:51.541 --> 18:54.250
He gave me 200,000 in cash.

18:54.250 --> 18:55.708
Wow.

18:55.708 --> 18:57.625
- How generous.
- Isn't it?

18:58.166 --> 19:00.875
But, sweetie, how did all this happen?

19:00.875 --> 19:02.208
And so quickly.

19:02.208 --> 19:05.291
Well, no, not quickly.
I mean, at the same time.

19:05.291 --> 19:06.291
I don't know.

19:07.958 --> 19:09.500
It's been a tsunami.

Psst!

Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

20:04.375 --> 20:07.333
At the moment, considering
the amount of evidence against him,

20:07.333 --> 20:11.333
in my opinion,
the best strategy for your husband

20:11.333 --> 20:12.916
is to plead guilty.

20:12.916 --> 20:16.708
[gasps] Why should he plead guilty
when he's innocent?

20:16.708 --> 20:19.208
If he acknowledges his involvement
in the heist,

20:19.208 --> 20:21.208
I can negotiate a reduced sentence.

20:23.875 --> 20:24.875
Claude, right?

20:24.875 --> 20:25.875
Yes.

20:26.458 --> 20:27.750
Let's try to be positive.

20:27.750 --> 20:30.625
Camille believes François is innocent,
and I do as well.

20:30.625 --> 20:32.000
And who are you, sir?

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
I'm her lover, but that's irrelevant.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.625
What's important
is that we are all here to help.

20:36.625 --> 20:39.000
And I am also here to help, monsieur.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.833
That is why I'm informing you
of the current situation.

20:41.833 --> 20:43.416
[Camille] If you're here to help,

20:43.416 --> 20:45.541
then study the case
and get my husband out of jail.

20:45.541 --> 20:46.875
Please, monsieur.

20:46.875 --> 20:47.875
[Claude sighs]

20:49.291 --> 20:51.666
All right, then. Shall we begin?

20:52.166 --> 20:54.250
Where were you on the night in question?

20:54.250 --> 20:56.916
I spent the night
at the Château Rêve d'Or.

20:56.916 --> 20:58.500
Were you with your husband?

21:00.458 --> 21:01.583
No, I was with him.

21:01.583 --> 21:03.791
And when was the last time
you spoke with your husband

21:03.791 --> 21:04.875
before the robbery?

21:04.875 --> 21:06.166
That same day.

21:06.166 --> 21:10.208
- And the nature of your conversation?
- [tense music pulsing]

21:10.208 --> 21:13.458
He called me. He was upset.
He had learned about our affair.

21:13.958 --> 21:17.458
Do you think your husband's behavior
may have been affected by this discovery?

21:17.458 --> 21:21.291
Do you think the psychological stress
impacted his decision-making?

21:21.291 --> 21:23.833
And is it possible
he carried out this heist

21:23.833 --> 21:27.958
in a desperate attempt to escape
from you and your lover?

21:27.958 --> 21:31.208
The jewels that were stolen
belonged to some of the most important

21:31.208 --> 21:33.166
and most powerful families in Europe.

21:33.666 --> 21:36.375
There are 44 of Europe's finest law firms

21:36.375 --> 21:39.500
working at this moment to ensure
Monsieur Polignac is found guilty.

21:39.500 --> 21:41.750
They are all working against him.

21:41.750 --> 21:44.375
Basically, their objective
is to make sure Viénot's insurance

21:44.375 --> 21:48.041
pays out 100%
of the value of the stolen jewels.

21:48.041 --> 21:50.250
And when that happens,

21:50.250 --> 21:53.916
would you prefer that your husband
be incarcerated for ten years

21:53.916 --> 21:55.291
or for 20?

21:55.291 --> 21:59.416
Madame Polignac, I strongly suggest
that you adopt my strategy.

21:59.416 --> 22:01.041
Plead guilty to all charges.

22:01.041 --> 22:02.708

22:43.375 --> 22:45.875
[tense music building]

22:48.125 --> 22:52.458
Read my lips carefully, Claude,
because I want you to remember everything.

22:52.458 --> 22:56.416
You are going to go home,
and you're going to study the case.

22:56.416 --> 22:59.541
Tomorrow you will call Camille
and tell her you have found a way

22:59.541 --> 23:01.250
to get her husband released.

23:01.250 --> 23:06.375
Because if you don't,
some night I'm gonna break into your home,

23:06.375 --> 23:09.083
and I will use chloroform
to put you to sleep.

23:09.083 --> 23:11.375
Then I will put a funnel in your mouth,

23:11.375 --> 23:15.500
and pour hydrochloric acid
down your throat.

23:15.500 --> 23:18.791
Seconds later, your tongue
will begin to melt,

23:19.541 --> 23:21.916
and your teeth will dissolve.

23:21.916 --> 23:25.375
You will no longer savor
the taste of French wine and cheese.

23:25.375 --> 23:28.625
And of course,
you will never ever practice law again.

23:33.625 --> 23:36.583
So, may I walk you to the door?

23:37.125 --> 23:38.000

37:44.666 --> 37:47.333
There's something, um,
I've been meaning to say.

37:47.333 --> 37:49.500
You know, I'm really sorry for everything.

37:49.500 --> 37:50.958
- No, no, no.
- No, listen.

37:50.958 --> 37:52.208
Listen to me.

37:53.000 --> 37:56.666
Damián, I want to apologize
for all that nonsense I said

37:56.666 --> 37:58.458
when we were in the vault together, and--

37:58.458 --> 38:00.416
No, don't apologize. You were right.

38:00.416 --> 38:02.208
And you know what else?

38:02.208 --> 38:04.666
The perfect love story
<i>can</i> happen in one day.

38:04.666 --> 38:06.958
Huh? Real, tangible love.

38:06.958 --> 38:10.333
Twenty-four-karat love.
And with a stranger.

38:11.750 --> 38:13.250
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

38:13.250 --> 38:14.500
[both laugh]

38:14.500 --> 38:16.500
- [Damián] Yeah!
- But when?

38:16.500 --> 38:18.166
Today. It happened today.

38:18.166 --> 38:19.583
It happened today. Yeah.

38:19.583 --> 38:21.291
[both laugh]

38:21.291 --> 38:22.375
Cheers.

38:23.333 --> 38:24.583
[Damián] Hmm!

38:24.583 --> 38:27.416
And I finally understood
what you said to me.

38:27.416 --> 38:28.833
Which is...?

38:28.833 --> 38:33.416
That you cannot refuse a single moment
of love just because it'll end.

38:33.416 --> 38:35.333
- No, no, no.
- Yes, you were right!

38:35.333 --> 38:37.875
I absolutely disagree with you.
Absolutely!

38:37.875 --> 38:39.083
What do you mean?

38:39.083 --> 38:40.291
- What are you saying?
- No, um...

38:40.291 --> 38:41.375
Thank you.

38:41.375 --> 38:43.208
I mean, the person who was right, was you.

38:43.208 --> 38:44.208
- Nonsense.
- No.

38:44.208 --> 38:47.625
You see, I have become a fugitive of love.

38:48.125 --> 38:52.375
And what I really want,
if I'm honest, is that it last forever.

38:52.375 --> 38:55.416
- [chuckles softly] You?
- Mm-hmm.

38:55.416 --> 38:56.916
- In love forever?
- Yeah.

38:56.916 --> 38:58.666
Yeah? Boring love.

38:58.666 --> 39:03.375
Yeah, I mean, my own experience of love is
that it just melts away, you know?

39:03.375 --> 39:04.541
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

39:04.541 --> 39:05.958
I realize the only thing I know...

39:05.958 --> 39:09.583
The only thing I've ever known
about love is the beginning.

39:10.583 --> 39:15.583
But what I want, what I really want,
is to experience a love that never ends.

39:16.916 --> 39:18.333
There's always an end.

39:19.958 --> 39:22.250
Listen to me. Carmen. You remember Carmen?

39:22.250 --> 39:24.125
Carmen? Of course I remember Carmen.

39:25.208 --> 39:26.333
She left me.

39:26.333 --> 39:30.041
It appears that our time together
had run its course.

39:30.041 --> 39:33.833
It seems she was waiting...
for someone better.

39:36.791 --> 39:39.583
And now, she's found someone.

39:40.083 --> 39:41.000
That's life.

39:41.000 --> 39:42.250
How are you coping?

39:43.791 --> 39:46.291
[sighs, chuckles]

39:48.250 --> 39:49.750
Well, you know what it is,

39:49.750 --> 39:54.041
the melancholy, the confusion,
the uncertainty of being a free man again.

39:54.041 --> 39:56.750
- Huh? [chuckles]
- Hmm.

39:56.750 --> 39:58.375
Look at those poor bastards.

40:00.833 --> 40:02.333
- [Berlin] I... [scoffs]
- They're so happy.

40:02.333 --> 40:04.791
- [both laugh]
- [wedding guests applaud]

40:04.791 --> 40:06.208
My friend, you know what?

40:06.208 --> 40:09.458
With all our experience
and with our deep knowledge of love...

40:09.458 --> 40:10.458
Yeah?

40:11.125 --> 40:12.208
...we cannot stay silent.

40:12.208 --> 40:14.500
- After you.
- Cheers.

40:15.625 --> 40:16.625
- [glass clinks]
- Mm.

40:16.625 --> 40:18.166
[light chatter]

40:18.166 --> 40:20.750
[sighs] I'm sorry to interrupt.

40:21.250 --> 40:23.916
My friend and I are tourists.
We're Spanish.

40:23.916 --> 40:27.291
We saw the lovely couple brimming
with enthusiasm and joy,

40:27.291 --> 40:29.625
so we just wanted to say congratulations.

40:29.625 --> 40:34.458
And as our wedding gift, we want
to offer you all we know about love.

40:34.458 --> 40:37.458
Based on years of study
and scientific observation.

40:37.458 --> 40:39.750
- Okay?
- [bride chuckles]

40:43.541 --> 40:44.583
[Cameron] Are you mad?

40:46.916 --> 40:47.916
No.

40:49.500 --> 40:50.541
Listen, Roi.

40:51.041 --> 40:54.125
[sighs] Mixing sex and work,
it's not a good idea.

40:55.666 --> 40:58.916
Hey, come on. Don't you remember?
That's what you said when we met.

40:59.583 --> 41:01.833
But... But this isn't about sex.

41:02.791 --> 41:05.250
That kiss would've had
nothing to do with that.

41:06.541 --> 41:07.750
It was love.

41:08.750 --> 41:09.750
And you know it.

41:11.041 --> 41:13.166
Because if it was only sex,

41:14.083 --> 41:18.458
well then, if all you really wanted
was to fuck,

41:18.958 --> 41:20.958
you would've kissed me, right?

41:20.958 --> 41:23.333
Well, first, you would've looked
at my forehead,

41:23.333 --> 41:25.500
to check my expiration date.

41:26.916 --> 41:28.708
The 25th of October.

41:29.333 --> 41:30.333
[scoffs]

41:30.333 --> 41:32.958
- And then we'd have made out.
- Don't say that.

41:32.958 --> 41:35.375
I'm saying I'm crazy about you.

41:37.041 --> 41:38.416
Since the moment we met.

41:38.916 --> 41:40.750
Since I saw your tattoo.

41:40.750 --> 41:42.541
But I couldn't do anything.

41:43.041 --> 41:45.708
For one, I had no idea what was going on.

41:47.916 --> 41:50.583
And also because Berlin asked me not to.

41:50.583 --> 41:56.500
And when I finally decided to,
I realized <i>you</i> were the one who couldn't.

41:56.500 --> 41:58.416
Because you're scared to death.

42:01.958 --> 42:03.458
So I'm fucked.

42:04.541 --> 42:06.750
I'm fucked because I arrived late
in this story.

42:06.750 --> 42:08.708
I'm fucked because I arrived after Jimmy.

42:08.708 --> 42:11.333
And because now you're afraid
to take a step forward.

42:11.333 --> 42:14.000
And you know, deep down,
that if I had been with you before him,

42:14.000 --> 42:15.458
we'd still be together.

42:56.625 --> 42:59.625
Two good stories in my life,
and I'm late for both. [chuckles]

43:03.250 --> 43:06.125
And how do you know
that we'd still be together?

43:09.583 --> 43:11.083
You don't know that Roi.

43:11.875 --> 43:13.458
[radio beeps outside]

43:18.500 --> 43:19.375
[in French] Sorry.

43:19.375 --> 43:20.625
[Sierra] Mm-hmm.

43:25.958 --> 43:29.208
- [Cameron] I don't see anyone out there.
- That means they're here.
