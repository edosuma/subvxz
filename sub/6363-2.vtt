00:01.012 --> 00:02.657
<i>Last week...</i>

00:02.692 --> 00:04.225
<i>After a nationwide search</i>

00:04.260 --> 00:06.260
<i>for America's
next MasterChef Junior...</i>

00:06.296 --> 00:09.397
- Is everybody ready?
- Yes, Chef!

00:09.432 --> 00:11.733
<i>The biggest cooking
competition in the world...</i>

00:11.768 --> 00:13.701
It's his head!

00:13.737 --> 00:15.203
<i>Exploded into action.</i>

00:15.238 --> 00:16.838
Ugh, why am I so short?

00:16.873 --> 00:19.407
<i>But only the
very best made the grade.</i>

00:19.442 --> 00:20.875
These are amazing.

00:20.910 --> 00:23.010
Dang!
Out of control good.

00:23.046 --> 00:25.346
Christina, somebody
is chasing your job.

00:27.250 --> 00:28.616
<i>Tonight...</i>

00:28.651 --> 00:31.185
- You can do it!
- Frost some cupcakes!

00:31.221 --> 00:35.089
<i>The top 22 young home
cooks are in for a sweet treat.</i>

00:35.125 --> 00:37.325
Come on, come on, come on.

00:37.360 --> 00:38.993
<i>And the judges find themselves</i>

00:39.028 --> 00:40.895
<i>in a sticky situation.</i>

00:40.930 --> 00:43.331
Take off the shoes first.

00:43.366 --> 00:47.301
<i>Then Gordon Ramsay breaks
open a tough scallop challenge.</i>

00:47.337 --> 00:49.437
It's scientifically impossible.

00:49.472 --> 00:51.072
Why can't I get this open?

00:51.107 --> 00:52.718
<i>Which brings
the pint-sized chefs...</i>

00:52.742 --> 00:54.342
- Agh!
<i>- Out of their shell.</i>

00:54.377 --> 00:56.055
<i>I've got a funny feeling
you're going to be around</i>

00:56.079 --> 00:58.146
a long time.

01:07.457 --> 01:11.626
- Yeah!
- Welcome, guys!

01:11.661 --> 01:14.328
I am super-duper excited

01:14.364 --> 01:16.297
<i>for being in the top 22</i>

01:16.332 --> 01:19.300
<i>and I'm gonna win that trophy
for all the girls</i>

01:19.335 --> 01:22.103
that have not won
MasterChef Junior.

01:22.138 --> 01:24.138
- Hi!
- I'm back, baby!

01:24.174 --> 01:27.942
Back home in New York City,
I am 100% a rocker kid.

01:27.977 --> 01:31.612
<i>And if I win $100,000,
I want to open up</i>

01:31.648 --> 01:34.148
<i>my own rock 'n roll restaurant.</i>

01:34.184 --> 01:35.583
Whoo!

01:35.618 --> 01:38.653
Good morning!

01:38.688 --> 01:40.655
Wow, Avery, what did you have
for breakfast?

01:40.690 --> 01:42.390
I had a doughnut.

01:44.260 --> 01:45.760
How are we feeling?
Excited?

01:45.795 --> 01:48.362
Yes, Chef!

01:48.398 --> 01:49.797
Right, welcome back.

01:49.833 --> 01:53.534
You are the best
young home cooks in America.

01:53.570 --> 01:56.370
One of you will become America's
next MasterChef Junior.

01:56.406 --> 01:58.739
Whoo!

01:58.775 --> 02:00.441
Now, in the last challenge,

02:00.477 --> 02:03.077
there were three
outstanding winners.

02:03.112 --> 02:06.180
That was Jesse, Sam,
and Addison.

02:06.216 --> 02:08.181
Yeah!

02:08.217 --> 02:10.217
You three please stay there.

02:10.252 --> 02:13.387
Everybody else,
please step to the side.

02:13.423 --> 02:16.023
- What is going on?
- We don't have to cook!

02:16.059 --> 02:18.726
Feel like Sam's not gonna win..

02:18.761 --> 02:21.429
The next challenge
for you three only...

02:22.732 --> 02:26.100
Is a super sweet challenge
that just might

02:26.135 --> 02:29.337
get you a little frosted.

02:29.372 --> 02:31.038
Oh, no.

02:31.074 --> 02:32.640
Uh-uh, I don't like
the feeling of this.

02:32.675 --> 02:35.142
Now, this next
challenge is all about

02:35.178 --> 02:38.246
one of my favorite things
to make.

02:40.183 --> 02:41.415
What is it?

02:44.354 --> 02:45.987
A cupcake.

02:46.022 --> 02:48.322
Yes.

02:48.358 --> 02:50.558
Now, do you notice
anything strange

02:50.593 --> 02:52.026
with this cupcake?

02:52.061 --> 02:54.829
- There's no frosting.
- Yeah, there's no frosting.

02:54.864 --> 02:56.564
That's right.
This challenge

02:56.599 --> 02:58.833
is all about
the best part of the cupcake.

03:01.738 --> 03:03.204
The frosting.

03:03.239 --> 03:05.006
Can we eat it?

03:06.910 --> 03:09.277
So, you'll load the bag
with frosting,

03:09.312 --> 03:11.078
you give that piping bag
a little twist

03:11.114 --> 03:12.613
so it's nice and firm and taut

03:12.649 --> 03:14.549
with a little tail at the end.

03:14.584 --> 03:17.652
You start the frosting
on the outside in

03:17.687 --> 03:19.787
and I go around.

03:19.822 --> 03:21.489
Oh, boy.

03:21.524 --> 03:23.190
Your piping tip should always be

03:23.226 --> 03:26.594
just a little bit ahead
of where you want the frosting

03:26.629 --> 03:28.996
and you want to make sure
that frosting really hugs

03:29.032 --> 03:31.065
the outside of the cupcake.

03:31.100 --> 03:33.334
How do you do that?

03:33.369 --> 03:35.214
Then you bring
that frosting all the way up

03:35.238 --> 03:37.338
to a perfect little pyramid

03:37.373 --> 03:39.407
and you just release
the pressure

03:39.442 --> 03:42.243
so that you don't get a tail
that humps over.

03:42.278 --> 03:44.979
That is a picture perfect
frosted cupcake.

03:45.014 --> 03:47.281
- Wow.
- Good job, good job.

03:47.317 --> 03:50.418
But, we don't want
just one cupcake.

03:50.453 --> 03:52.720
Take a look over your shoulders.

03:52.755 --> 03:54.288
Oh, no.

03:57.160 --> 04:00.728
At your stations,
you have 60 cupcakes,

04:00.763 --> 04:04.432
six bowls of frosting,
and six piping bags.

04:04.467 --> 04:07.068
We want as many as you can frost

04:07.103 --> 04:09.170
in just ten minutes.

04:09.205 --> 04:10.671
- Ten?
- What?

04:10.707 --> 04:12.473
We want
a perfectly frosted cupcake

04:12.508 --> 04:15.309
just like this one.

04:15.345 --> 04:16.611
Oh, my God.

04:16.646 --> 04:18.879
The person with the most
perfectly frosted cupcakes

04:18.915 --> 04:20.947
will be safe from elimination.

04:20.983 --> 04:23.618
- Um, it's not that simple.
- Come on.

04:23.653 --> 04:25.853
There's more at stake than that.

04:27.123 --> 04:30.124
There's this.

04:31.394 --> 04:33.260
Oh.

04:33.296 --> 04:35.229
Oh, my God!

04:37.934 --> 04:41.002
Giant piping bags
full of frosting.

04:43.206 --> 04:46.641
This is the most frosting
I've ever seen in my life.

04:46.676 --> 04:48.576
<i>I'm a little tempted
just to go under one</i>

04:48.611 --> 04:49.977
<i>and open my mouth.</i>

04:51.814 --> 04:55.349
The winning home cook
will save one of us

04:55.385 --> 04:58.252
from being frosted.

04:58.287 --> 05:02.556
Jesse, you're playing for me.
Yes!

05:02.592 --> 05:05.259
- Sam, guess what?
- What?

05:05.294 --> 05:06.405
You're my bestie
in this challenge.

05:06.429 --> 05:08.029
All right?

05:08.064 --> 05:10.931
You're playing for me.

05:10.967 --> 05:12.900
Addison?

05:12.935 --> 05:14.013
Please tell me
you can beat these two boys.

05:14.037 --> 05:16.437
- I can beat them.
- Girl power!

05:16.472 --> 05:18.706
Addison, I'm counting on you.
Got me?

05:18.741 --> 05:20.274
Yes.

05:20.309 --> 05:21.776
<i>I mean, I really want to win,</i>

05:21.811 --> 05:24.812
but I also really want
to frost Ramsay.

05:26.749 --> 05:28.416
There's one other thing.

05:28.451 --> 05:30.117
- Oh, no.
- Oh, God.

05:30.153 --> 05:35.523
Because we're gonna be up here
awaiting our sticky fate,

05:35.558 --> 05:38.025
we actually brought in
a special judge

05:38.061 --> 05:40.628
to do this judging for us.

05:40.663 --> 05:44.265
Please welcome back
MasterChef Junior winner...

05:44.300 --> 05:46.434
Logan!

05:47.904 --> 05:51.038
Oh, my God!

05:51.074 --> 05:53.007
Welcome back.

05:53.042 --> 05:56.110
Logan is in the MasterChef
kitchen once again.

05:56.145 --> 05:58.179
<i>He is one of my heroes
and he's, like, standing,</i>

05:58.214 --> 05:59.358
<i>like, five feet away from me.</i>

05:59.382 --> 06:01.782
It is just so cool.
How have you been?

06:01.818 --> 06:02.917
It's been great.

06:02.952 --> 06:04.752
I've been doing
a lot of TV appearances.

06:04.787 --> 06:07.588
I cooked at the Oscars,
that was great,

06:07.623 --> 06:09.334
and I've just been doing
a lot of fun stuff.

06:09.358 --> 06:11.692
Brilliant.
Addison, question for Logan?

06:11.728 --> 06:14.061
What did the $100,000, like,

06:14.097 --> 06:16.497
what'd you use it mainly for?

06:16.532 --> 06:18.733
Well, the main part of it
is in the bank.

06:18.768 --> 06:20.835
Now have you still got
enough money in the bank

06:20.870 --> 06:22.803
to treat a young lady to dinner?

06:24.941 --> 06:26.841
Really?

06:29.245 --> 06:30.945
Logan, are you ready?

06:30.980 --> 06:33.080
I think that I'm
really capable of judging it

06:33.116 --> 06:34.749
'cause I won
the cupcake challenge.

06:34.784 --> 06:35.983
Cupcake King.

06:36.018 --> 06:38.385
Cupcake queen, cupcake king.

06:38.421 --> 06:39.587
Okay, Logan.

06:39.622 --> 06:41.922
Please head up to the balcony.
Good to see you.

06:41.958 --> 06:44.692
Thank you.

06:48.197 --> 06:52.366
Now it's time for you three
to head to your stations.

06:52.401 --> 06:53.901
Good luck, Addison.

06:53.936 --> 06:57.037
You got this, Jesse.

06:57.073 --> 06:59.740
I bake cupcakes all the time
and one day,

06:59.776 --> 07:01.342
I'm gonna have my own bakery,

07:01.377 --> 07:04.078
<i>so I know
what I'm dealing with here.</i>

07:04.113 --> 07:07.181
I love eating cupcakes,
but I don't make cupcakes.

07:07.216 --> 07:09.350
I'm not a baker,
so this challenge

07:09.385 --> 07:12.253
<i>might be a little difficult
for me.</i>

07:12.288 --> 07:15.456
- Are you three ready?
- Yes, Chef!

07:15.491 --> 07:19.560
Your ten minutes starts

07:19.595 --> 07:21.128
now!

07:23.065 --> 07:24.331
Come on, Sam!

07:24.367 --> 07:27.301
Quick, Addison!
More, more on there.

07:27.336 --> 07:29.637
Jesse, yes!
You got it!

07:29.672 --> 07:32.173
Remember, guys.
The winner saves

07:32.208 --> 07:35.576
one of the judges
from the frosting.

07:35.611 --> 07:37.511
Whoo!

07:37.547 --> 07:39.280
You can do it!

07:39.315 --> 07:40.859
What would your
strategy be here, Gordon?

07:40.883 --> 07:42.594
It's all about filling
up the piping bags first.

07:42.618 --> 07:43.762
Spend three minutes doing that.

07:43.786 --> 07:45.920
- All of 'em?
- All the bags.

07:45.955 --> 07:47.588
I would fill three

07:47.623 --> 07:49.623
because ten minutes
is a tricky thing.

07:49.659 --> 07:51.492
Addy, Addy!

07:51.527 --> 07:52.967
<i>My strategy is
to fill the piping bag</i>

07:52.995 --> 07:56.397
with as much frosting as I can
and just go, go, go, go, go!

07:56.432 --> 07:57.798
Go, Addy!

07:57.834 --> 08:00.401
- Addison's already piping.
- Good girl, Addison!

08:00.436 --> 08:02.503
Yeah!

08:02.538 --> 08:04.605
Jesse, yeah!

08:04.640 --> 08:07.708
- Strawberry power!
- Let's go, Jesse!

08:07.743 --> 08:09.410
I have to save Christina,

08:09.445 --> 08:14.381
<i>so my strategy
is to take my time</i>

08:14.417 --> 08:19.620
and frost the cupcakes
perfectly as possible.

08:19.655 --> 08:21.322
He's in the groove.

08:21.357 --> 08:25.092
Sam, I do not want this
chocolate frosting on my face!

08:25.127 --> 08:26.861
My strategy is
to frost as many cupcakes

08:26.896 --> 08:29.730
<i>as possible, so I'm moving
at the speed of light.</i>

08:29.765 --> 08:31.899
Get in a rhythm!
A rhythm!

08:34.837 --> 08:38.205
Come on, Jesse!
Once, twice, then up!

08:38.241 --> 08:40.073
Whoo!

08:40.109 --> 08:41.553
What numbers will make us safe?

08:41.577 --> 08:44.545
I'd say you need 12
to probably win.

08:44.580 --> 08:46.714
Frost some cupcakes!
Frost some cupcakes!

08:46.749 --> 08:48.026
There's a lot of things
that can go wrong

08:48.050 --> 08:49.316
<i>frosting a cupcake.</i>

08:49.352 --> 08:51.785
Like, too much frosting,
then it might start

08:51.821 --> 08:53.187
dripping down.

08:53.222 --> 08:54.955
- Not too much!
- Wow!

08:54.991 --> 08:58.492
<i>- Too little frosting...</i>
- Addison, put more on there!

08:58.527 --> 09:00.995
And then it would be a muffin,
not a cupcake.

09:01.030 --> 09:02.930
Think that Graham's
gonna be the safest.

09:02.965 --> 09:04.198
All right, Sam!

09:04.233 --> 09:07.134
90 seconds to go, guys!

09:07.169 --> 09:08.936
God!

09:08.971 --> 09:12.539
Addy, open up the bag!

09:12.575 --> 09:14.174
Addison, blow it!

09:14.210 --> 09:15.676
<i>I'm struggling.</i>

09:15.711 --> 09:18.479
I cannot get the frosting
into the piping bag.

09:18.514 --> 09:20.781
Please, I beg you, Addison!

09:20.816 --> 09:21.894
Who wants to see Gordon covered?

09:21.918 --> 09:23.617
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

09:23.653 --> 09:25.886
I need to speed up

09:25.922 --> 09:28.088
<i>or else the boys are gonna win.</i>

09:28.124 --> 09:30.491
Jesse's catching up on Addison.

09:30.526 --> 09:32.826
Let's go, yes, Jesse!
Perfect cupcake!

09:32.862 --> 09:34.128
Thank you!

09:34.163 --> 09:35.996
You guys are in trouble!

09:36.032 --> 09:38.132
We need as many
perfectly frosted cupcakes

09:38.167 --> 09:39.400
as you can do.

09:39.435 --> 09:40.601
Come on, come on, come on!

09:40.636 --> 09:42.336
That's gonna save one judge!

09:42.371 --> 09:44.171
Hurry up, buddy!

09:44.206 --> 09:45.673
Here we go!

09:45.708 --> 09:48.175
Ten, nine, eight,

09:48.210 --> 09:50.945
seven, six, five,

09:50.980 --> 09:54.481
four, three, two, one!

09:54.517 --> 09:59.253
- Let's go! All right!
- Piping bags down!

09:59.288 --> 10:02.356
And it is now
time for Logan to decide

10:02.391 --> 10:03.824
all of our fates.

10:03.859 --> 10:07.594
Logan, please count
the perfect cupcakes.

10:07.630 --> 10:08.996
All right, let's see.

10:09.031 --> 10:11.598
That one's good.
That one's good.

10:11.634 --> 10:13.500
That one's good.

10:13.536 --> 10:15.380
<i>I'm looking at my
cupcakes and I think they look</i>

10:15.404 --> 10:17.705
really good,
so I'm really confident

10:17.740 --> 10:22.242
<i>that Christina's pretty dress
won't be frosted.</i>

10:22.278 --> 10:23.944
<i>I look over to Jesse and Addison</i>

10:23.980 --> 10:26.347
and even though I have
more frosted cupcakes than them,

10:26.382 --> 10:28.349
<i>I don't think all of them
are going to be perfect.</i>

10:28.384 --> 10:29.616
<i>This is gonna be a close one.</i>

10:29.652 --> 10:31.051
A bit flat.

10:31.087 --> 10:32.597
Could have used a bit more,
but that one's good.

10:32.621 --> 10:33.921
That one's good.
That one's good.

10:33.956 --> 10:36.056
And, uh, that's about it.

10:36.092 --> 10:38.225
All right, let's see.

10:38.260 --> 10:39.626
Oh, wow.

10:39.662 --> 10:41.795
<i>I'm looking down at my cupcakes
and some of 'em</i>

10:41.831 --> 10:43.263
<i>are not too pretty.</i>

10:43.299 --> 10:46.133
A bit too much frosting
on both sides here.

10:46.168 --> 10:48.602
I'm sending Logan, like,
brain messages

10:48.637 --> 10:52.106
because I want him
to be not too picky.

10:52.141 --> 10:53.774
That one's pretty good.

10:53.809 --> 10:56.610
That one's pretty good.
All right.

10:56.645 --> 10:58.445
Right, Addison, Jesse, Sam,
please come down

10:58.481 --> 11:00.948
and stand in front.

11:06.622 --> 11:08.100
First of all, we are gonna have

11:08.124 --> 11:12.326
to find out who came in
at the bottom.

11:12.361 --> 11:15.729
Logan, just tell me
what the lowest number was.

11:18.267 --> 11:19.400
Ten.

11:19.435 --> 11:23.537
Logan, was that Jesse,
Sam, or Addison?

11:26.375 --> 11:28.675
I'm afraid that Addison
has the least amount

11:28.711 --> 11:30.411
of frosted cupcakes.

11:32.181 --> 11:34.148
Sorry, Gordon.
Recount!

11:34.183 --> 11:37.051
I couldn't get the frosting
in the bag.

11:38.387 --> 11:42.356
Addison, you now have
the incredible honor

11:42.391 --> 11:44.958
of pouring frosting on the head

11:44.994 --> 11:48.128
- of Mr. Gordon Ramsay.
- No.

11:48.164 --> 11:50.364
That's the best thing
in the world.

11:50.399 --> 11:51.799
<i>I really don't want
Gordon Ramsay</i>

11:51.834 --> 11:54.201
<i>to like, hate me forever,
but then I'm like,</i>

11:54.236 --> 11:56.170
"Hey, look at the good side.

11:56.205 --> 11:58.972
"You're about to get
to dump a whole bag of frosting

11:59.008 --> 12:00.441
on Gordon Ramsay."

12:00.476 --> 12:03.577
Five, four, three,

12:03.612 --> 12:06.213
two, one!

12:08.551 --> 12:10.422
Whoo!

12:12.293 --> 12:14.788
No way!
Oh, my God!

12:20.267 --> 12:24.569
Five, four, three, two, one!

12:30.143 --> 12:33.211
Whoo!

12:33.246 --> 12:35.880
- No, way!
- Oh, my God.

12:35.916 --> 12:38.016
Looks like the world's
biggest seagull pooped on him.

12:40.120 --> 12:41.853
Addison!

12:41.888 --> 12:43.788
Do you have anything
to say to Gordon, Addison?

12:43.823 --> 12:45.390
Sorry?

12:47.127 --> 12:50.361
Logan, now the question
is between Christina and I

12:50.397 --> 12:51.996
who's gonna get dumped on next.

12:52.032 --> 12:56.534
All right,
the numbers are 11 and 29.

12:56.570 --> 12:58.269
Who got 29?

12:58.305 --> 13:02.273
Uh, I'm gonna have to go with...

13:02.309 --> 13:03.875
Graham, you got the 29.

13:03.910 --> 13:05.977
- Yeah, Sam!
- Yeah!

13:06.012 --> 13:08.746
- No-ho-ho-ho-ho!
- Yeah, I got ya!

13:08.782 --> 13:11.049
That means
that Sam gets the advantage

13:11.084 --> 13:13.184
- moving forward...
- Yeah!

13:13.219 --> 13:18.423
And Christina is gonna get
that dress completely doused.

13:18.458 --> 13:19.557
Should we do it?

13:19.593 --> 13:20.725
Yeah!

13:20.760 --> 13:21.826
You guys ready?

13:21.861 --> 13:23.039
<i>No, no!
Take off the shoes first!</i>

13:23.063 --> 13:25.229
Take off the shoes first.

13:25.265 --> 13:26.431
Let's do this.

13:29.102 --> 13:30.802
Jesse...

13:39.446 --> 13:41.212
Frosting fight!

13:41.247 --> 13:44.115
Frosting fight! Frosting fight!

13:44.150 --> 13:46.451
Agh!

13:48.688 --> 13:49.854
You guys are evil!

13:49.889 --> 13:51.589
Sprinkles! Sprinkles!

13:51.625 --> 13:54.525
Out of nowhere, someone yells,
"Sprinkles! Sprinkles!"

13:54.561 --> 13:56.194
And I'm like,
that's cool and all.

13:56.229 --> 13:57.773
I'm not a big sprinkles guy,
but, I mean,

13:57.797 --> 13:59.364
I'll throw sprinkles
on the judges.

14:01.267 --> 14:05.703
Ah, yeah!

14:09.175 --> 14:10.575
Okay, listen, listen, listen!

14:10.610 --> 14:13.811
All of you, please, join me
in saying a big thank you

14:13.847 --> 14:16.648
to our amazing
<i>MasterChef Junior</i> winner.

14:16.683 --> 14:19.117
Logan, thank you, buddy.

14:19.152 --> 14:20.218
Thank you.

14:20.253 --> 14:22.487
Thank you, Logan!

14:22.522 --> 14:23.621
Thank you so much!

14:23.657 --> 14:25.923
Bye, Logan!

14:25.959 --> 14:30.161
Right.
We will see you in a minute.

14:30.196 --> 14:31.796
Let's go.

14:31.831 --> 14:33.598
You need more than a minute!

14:40.306 --> 14:43.741
Whoa!

14:43.777 --> 14:44.909
What?

14:44.944 --> 14:46.577
It's scientifically impossible.

14:46.613 --> 14:48.379
- Amazing.
- She has the same dress on?

14:48.415 --> 14:49.847
Wow.

14:49.883 --> 14:52.417
It's time to get
the next challenge started.

14:52.452 --> 14:54.752
Now, putting frosting
on those cupcakes

14:54.788 --> 14:57.955
was all about making
the outside look beautiful,

14:57.991 --> 15:02.527
but under here is an ingredient
where you find the beauty

15:02.562 --> 15:04.829
on the inside.

15:04.864 --> 15:08.800
It is a beautiful,

15:08.835 --> 15:13.805
delicious...

15:13.840 --> 15:15.006
scallop.

15:17.677 --> 15:20.278
Shh, calm down.

15:20.313 --> 15:21.713
<i>I live in Indiana.</i>

15:21.748 --> 15:24.248
How...
there's no fresh scallops there.

15:24.284 --> 15:27.251
<i>I don't live by an ocean,
but I wish I lived by an ocean</i>

15:27.287 --> 15:31.756
'cause I love...

15:31.791 --> 15:33.624
seafood.

15:33.660 --> 15:35.059
These are all
hand-dived scallops,

15:35.095 --> 15:38.296
still inside
their amazing shell.

15:38.331 --> 15:40.164
When they're this fresh,
trust me...

15:40.200 --> 15:42.333
You have to get them
out yourself.

15:42.368 --> 15:44.068
Oh, no.

15:44.104 --> 15:47.739
So let me show you
how it's done.

15:52.011 --> 15:54.045
Right, watch very carefully

15:54.080 --> 15:56.180
because you'll all
be doing this shortly.

15:56.216 --> 15:57.882
So, scallop, you got
the round bottom part

15:57.917 --> 15:59.617
and the flat top.

15:59.652 --> 16:01.719
Now the secret here
is to take your knife,

16:01.755 --> 16:05.289
place into the muscle,
and twist.

16:05.325 --> 16:08.025
Point the knife 90 degrees
and scrape

16:08.061 --> 16:11.963
to remove the top of the shell

16:11.998 --> 16:15.933
and then flick open
and then look.

16:15.969 --> 16:18.136
This is the important part.

16:18.171 --> 16:20.004
Is it alive?

16:20.039 --> 16:21.572
Move in, quick look.
Quick, quick.

16:21.608 --> 16:22.852
- I can't see.
- I can't see, too short.

16:22.876 --> 16:24.308
See, watch.

16:24.344 --> 16:26.611
It's still alive.

16:26.646 --> 16:28.846
- It's alive.
- Yeah.

16:30.750 --> 16:32.416
Line up, line up,
line up, line up.

16:32.452 --> 16:35.119
That scared me!

16:35.155 --> 16:37.922
Okay, from there,
take the knife.

16:37.957 --> 16:41.359
You scrape down this part.

16:41.394 --> 16:43.661
As soon as you open up
the scallop shell,

16:43.696 --> 16:46.297
you have to deal with
all this green booger stuff

16:46.332 --> 16:49.567
<i>and, probably,
I don't even know what it is.</i>

16:49.602 --> 16:52.103
Probably seaweed, dra...
I don't know.

16:52.138 --> 16:54.672
And once you start to prise
the scallop from the shell,

16:54.707 --> 16:56.274
take a spoon.

16:56.309 --> 16:58.509
The reason why we use a spoon
is it's the same size

16:58.545 --> 17:00.745
of the scallop and so, look...

17:00.780 --> 17:03.147
You just scrape the spoon
against the shell

17:03.183 --> 17:05.715
and look what happens.

17:05.752 --> 17:07.018
- Ew.
- Gross.

17:07.053 --> 17:10.354
Out comes
this beautiful scallop.

17:10.390 --> 17:12.824
Now this is the muscle.

17:12.858 --> 17:14.724
It's the muscle
that connects the scallop

17:14.761 --> 17:16.394
to what we call the skirt.

17:16.429 --> 17:20.064
You take your thumb
and you slice through

17:20.098 --> 17:24.734
and then literally
just pop the scallop out.

17:24.771 --> 17:26.137
That's awesome.

17:26.172 --> 17:29.373
Now that is
the most amazing protein.

17:29.409 --> 17:31.275
It's good enough to eat raw.

17:31.311 --> 17:32.977
Eat it!
Eat it!

17:33.012 --> 17:34.679
- Oh.
- Ew.

17:36.382 --> 17:37.348
- Mmm.
- He likes it.

17:37.383 --> 17:40.184
It was alive seconds ago!

17:40.220 --> 17:41.719
Mmm.

17:41.754 --> 17:43.487
Excellent.

17:43.523 --> 17:45.389
So, Sam, because you won
the last challenge,

17:45.425 --> 17:48.726
you do not have
to cook in this challenge.

17:50.029 --> 17:52.597
On the balcony
is a giant cupcake

17:52.632 --> 17:54.065
that I made just for you.

17:54.100 --> 17:56.033
Oh, my God.

17:56.069 --> 17:57.468
Head on up and dig in.

17:57.503 --> 17:59.103
How you gonna eat that?

17:59.138 --> 18:01.873
Good job!

18:01.908 --> 18:04.976
Wow, this cupcake is, like,
the size of my head.

18:05.011 --> 18:06.611
Enjoy that, Sam.

18:06.646 --> 18:08.546
Right now,
victory's pretty sweet.

18:08.581 --> 18:11.082
You guys are going
to have one hour

18:11.117 --> 18:14.585
to make us
a MasterChef worthy dish

18:14.621 --> 18:17.521
using the amazing live scallops

18:17.557 --> 18:20.258
that you guys
have to shuck yourselves.

18:20.293 --> 18:21.959
We will unfortunately
be saying good-bye

18:21.995 --> 18:23.794
to some of you tonight.

18:23.830 --> 18:26.530
- No.
- Stay focused, guys.

18:26.566 --> 18:27.999
Is everybody ready?

18:28.034 --> 18:29.734
Yes, Chef!

18:29.769 --> 18:32.336
You're one hour starts...

18:34.607 --> 18:35.740
now!

18:35.775 --> 18:38.409
- Go, go, go!
- Whoo!

18:41.748 --> 18:44.215
<i>I may be only 11 years old,</i>

18:44.250 --> 18:46.250
but I am a mad scientist
in the kitchen.

18:46.286 --> 18:47.618
Does anybody see
Israeli couscous?

18:47.654 --> 18:50.755
<i>I am gonna combine
all sorts of different flavors</i>

18:50.790 --> 18:52.223
<i>into my scallop dish.</i>

18:52.258 --> 18:53.557
Red wine vinegar!

18:53.593 --> 18:55.860
I like putting things together
like Frankenstein.

18:55.895 --> 18:57.261
Where are the Brussels sprouts?

18:57.297 --> 18:59.964
I'm from Chula Vista
which is right next to a beach.

18:59.999 --> 19:03.067
<i>I love scallops.
I cook 'em all the time,</i>

19:03.102 --> 19:05.703
so I'm thinking something
really complicated

19:05.738 --> 19:07.638
to really wow the judges.

19:07.674 --> 19:08.906
Let's go!

19:14.314 --> 19:16.247
What?
Get open.

19:16.282 --> 19:17.481
Hello.

19:17.517 --> 19:19.383
- Oh!
- Yes.

19:19.419 --> 19:20.796
These are tough ones.
I mean, scallops.

19:20.820 --> 19:22.586
You know,
even for a professional chef.

19:22.622 --> 19:24.322
These are 8
to 13-year-old kids.

19:24.357 --> 19:26.324
Too hard for these guys?

19:26.359 --> 19:27.625
Here's the thing;

19:27.660 --> 19:28.804
They could leave half of it
on the shell

19:28.828 --> 19:31.028
when they take that top lid off.

19:31.064 --> 19:32.363
Ugh!

19:32.398 --> 19:33.965
- You could stab it.
- Blah

19:34.000 --> 19:35.244
Slice it in half.
It'd fall apart.

19:35.268 --> 19:36.567
Oh, my God!

19:36.602 --> 19:38.162
So, you've got
to be very, very careful.

19:39.205 --> 19:40.504
I'm amazed already at Mia.

19:40.540 --> 19:41.784
Look, she's taken three scallops
out of the shell

19:41.808 --> 19:42.952
in literally three minutes.
Wow.

19:42.976 --> 19:44.308
Incredible.

19:44.344 --> 19:46.110
- Blah.
- Ew!

19:47.280 --> 19:49.046
Yeah, I'm putting on
some gloves.

19:49.082 --> 19:50.381
Let's go!

19:50.416 --> 19:52.216
Don't cook your scallops
too early.

19:58.157 --> 20:01.225
Why can't I get this open?

20:01.260 --> 20:03.861
When Gordon Ramsay does it,
it's so easy for him!

20:03.896 --> 20:06.464
Oh, my God.

20:06.499 --> 20:09.567
I hate opening scallops.

20:09.602 --> 20:12.203
<i>I'm only 8 years old.
How am I gonna do this?</i>

20:12.238 --> 20:13.971
It's so hard.

20:14.007 --> 20:15.606
Ian, are you all right?

20:15.641 --> 20:17.475
Ian is really feeling
the pressure.

20:17.510 --> 20:20.311
- Oh, dear.
- Just believe in yourself!

20:28.921 --> 20:30.287
How you doing, Ian?

20:30.323 --> 20:32.490
Not so good.
It's so hard to open.

20:32.525 --> 20:34.592
It's okay!
You can do this.

20:34.627 --> 20:36.627
Ian is really feeling
the pressure.

20:36.662 --> 20:38.396
Just believe in yourself.

20:38.431 --> 20:40.898
Don't panic, Ian.

20:40.933 --> 20:43.801
Ian, how we doing, bud?

20:43.836 --> 20:45.703
Don't get upset, my man.
That's not bad.

20:45.738 --> 20:47.805
- I know.
- Let me help you, okay?

20:47.840 --> 20:50.007
In.

20:50.043 --> 20:51.275
There we are.

20:51.310 --> 20:53.577
Now your parents, Ian,
have a restaurant, right?

20:53.613 --> 20:55.012
Yes, oh.

20:55.048 --> 20:56.247
- In Indiana, yes?
- Yes.

20:56.282 --> 20:58.349
- Oh, look at that?
- Ew, what is it?

20:58.384 --> 21:00.151
A little fish!
How cool is that?

21:00.186 --> 21:02.319
- Oh, my God!
- Got caught inside!

21:02.355 --> 21:04.299
Okay, so you can do the rest
if I do this bit, okay?

21:04.323 --> 21:05.856
Okay.
Thank you.

21:05.892 --> 21:07.124
Good man.
What's the dish?

21:07.160 --> 21:08.526
It's gonna be
a pan-seared scallop

21:08.561 --> 21:11.328
served with zucchini cakes
and a micro green salad.

21:11.364 --> 21:12.875
Sounds like you've got nothing
to be nervous about.

21:12.899 --> 21:14.143
Come on, you can do this.

21:14.167 --> 21:15.766
- Okay, thank you.
- Good luck.

21:20.573 --> 21:23.407
Whoo!
Oh, my God.

21:23.443 --> 21:25.576
We're sending
home cooks home tonight.

21:25.611 --> 21:28.179
What are places that you
wouldn't take a scallop dish?

21:28.214 --> 21:29.758
I'm not expecting them
to do a sweet thing.

21:29.782 --> 21:31.916
I don't want to see it
thrown over a bowl of pasta.

21:31.951 --> 21:34.071
I want to see something
a little bit more adventurous.

21:35.488 --> 21:37.232
<i>I'm making pan-seared scallops
over lemon risotto</i>

21:37.256 --> 21:40.257
with a pepper salsa
along with a beetroot garnish

21:40.293 --> 21:42.193
<i>in a Brussels sprout design.</i>

21:42.228 --> 21:45.563
I'm extremely competitive mostly
cause I do a lot of martial arts.

21:45.598 --> 21:47.231
I really want to win this.

21:47.266 --> 21:49.900
I think the biggest issue here
is them cooking the scallop.

21:49.936 --> 21:52.069
Yes, I mean, you spend 25,
30 minutes on the prep

21:52.105 --> 21:54.016
and literally wait till
the last five or ten minutes

21:54.040 --> 21:55.317
before you start cooking
those scallops.

21:55.341 --> 21:56.518
How long do you
cook it on each side?

21:56.542 --> 21:57.975
Maximum 90 seconds on each side.

22:01.681 --> 22:04.081
Even though I'm from Philly,
I'm a huge seafood maniac.

22:04.117 --> 22:06.117
I love it, I could eat it
all day, all night.

22:06.152 --> 22:09.153
So I am making
pan-seared scallops

22:09.188 --> 22:12.723
with a pinch of Brussels sprout
and cauliflower mash.

22:12.758 --> 22:14.959
It's quite the experience.

22:14.994 --> 22:18.596
I'm making California scallops
on a bed of spinach with quinoa

22:18.631 --> 22:21.799
<i>and I'm doing
an avocado lime sauce</i>

22:21.834 --> 22:26.370
because I love avocados.

22:26.405 --> 22:28.672
Guys, 27 minutes left.

22:28.708 --> 22:30.141
- Hey, Vivian.
- Hi.

22:30.176 --> 22:32.710
Do you cook a lot of scallops
in Arizona?

22:32.745 --> 22:35.279
I've never cooked
or tasted a scallop in my life.

22:35.314 --> 22:36.814
- Wow!
- Ooh!

22:36.849 --> 22:38.816
So tell us
what this scallop dish is.

22:38.851 --> 22:42.219
I am doing a bacon
and corn relish

22:42.255 --> 22:44.455
with a parmesan crusted scallops

22:44.490 --> 22:46.056
over a lemon and lime couscous.

22:46.092 --> 22:48.459
Are you worried
about anything on your dish?

22:48.494 --> 22:50.895
Um, I'm a little worried
about cooking the scallops

22:50.930 --> 22:52.696
since I've never
made them before

22:52.732 --> 22:54.899
and I feel like that will
definitely send me home

22:54.934 --> 22:56.167
in the competition.

22:56.202 --> 22:58.469
Yeah, very carefully, right?
Good luck, Vivian.

22:58.504 --> 23:00.604
- All right.
- Thank you!

23:00.640 --> 23:02.006
Ooh, that's hot.

23:02.041 --> 23:03.185
Annabelle.
All right, how we doing?

23:03.209 --> 23:04.486
I am having a lot of trouble
shucking these.

23:04.510 --> 23:05.721
Okay, let's do it again,
together.

23:05.745 --> 23:07.044
Okay.

23:07.079 --> 23:08.779
Ever had fresh scallops before?

23:08.814 --> 23:12.082
We don't really find
a lot of scallops in Tennessee.

23:12.118 --> 23:13.128
Wow, look at that.
You had a fish inside yours

23:13.152 --> 23:15.886
as well, huh?
Incredible.

23:15.922 --> 23:17.054
Now what's the dish?

23:17.089 --> 23:19.156
I'm making scallops two ways.
Wow.

23:19.192 --> 23:20.357
Scallop seviche.

23:20.393 --> 23:21.670
Seviche,
and what's the second way?

23:21.694 --> 23:25.029
Pan-seared scallops with
garlic-scented zucchini sauce.

23:25.064 --> 23:26.897
Why not just
do them one way perfect?

23:26.933 --> 23:28.966
I guess I could do
two ways perfect, so...

23:29.001 --> 23:30.234
Okay, good luck.

23:30.269 --> 23:31.869
You gotta cook
your scallops last.

23:31.904 --> 23:33.837
A little advice.

23:33.873 --> 23:36.907
15 minutes to go, guys.

23:36.943 --> 23:38.475
Chad, what's the dish?

23:38.511 --> 23:43.013
I'm making a pan-seared scallop
with spaghetti and meatballs

23:43.049 --> 23:45.849
and a homemade tomato sauce.

23:45.885 --> 23:47.851
Now is that gonna
rally show off the scallop

23:47.887 --> 23:49.153
as the star?

23:49.188 --> 23:51.021
Yes, I'm going
to give the scallops

23:51.057 --> 23:53.958
more flavor than the meatballs
so you'll get pop

23:53.993 --> 23:55.526
in your mouth.

23:55.561 --> 23:57.039
All right, I'm just hoping
that we don't just get

23:57.063 --> 23:58.529
a big dish
of spaghetti and meatballs

23:58.564 --> 23:59.808
that are garnished
with a couple little scallops

23:59.832 --> 24:00.998
on top, right?

24:01.033 --> 24:02.077
It's gotta be
a good scallop dish.

24:02.101 --> 24:03.200
- Okay.
- All right?

24:03.236 --> 24:04.279
All right, good luck, Chad.

24:04.303 --> 24:05.536
Thank you.

24:07.306 --> 24:08.906
Eight minutes to go!

24:08.941 --> 24:10.052
All right, now
you should start thinking

24:10.076 --> 24:11.842
about cooking your scallops.

24:11.877 --> 24:15.145
Make sure your pans
are piping hot.

24:15.181 --> 24:17.748
They literally take
90 seconds on each side.

24:20.386 --> 24:21.463
Amaya, how are we doing?
Talk me through the dish.

24:21.487 --> 24:22.720
What is it?

24:22.755 --> 24:24.833
I'm making pan-seared scallops
with a bechamel sauce.

24:24.857 --> 24:26.101
And you're grilling
the asparagus as well?

24:26.125 --> 24:27.391
- Yes.
- That tastes delicious.

24:27.426 --> 24:28.692
Thank you.

24:28.728 --> 24:30.894
Now you're a New Jersey girl,
right?

24:30.930 --> 24:32.140
- Yeah.
- So close to the coast?

24:32.164 --> 24:33.964
And what do you think
about fresh scallops?

24:34.000 --> 24:36.767
Well, they're kind of
a pain to open.

24:36.802 --> 24:38.602
A pain?
Amaya, they're delicious!

24:38.638 --> 24:39.870
Uh, yes.

24:39.905 --> 24:41.049
That dish sounds incredible.
Asparagus looks good.

24:41.073 --> 24:44.975
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

24:45.011 --> 24:46.644
Nice color, Nate!

24:51.517 --> 24:54.618
Oh!
Yeah, I burned some of them.

24:54.654 --> 24:58.522
My scallops are totally burnt
and I have no scallops left.

24:58.557 --> 25:00.624
<i>I can't serve this
to the judges.</i>

25:00.660 --> 25:04.194
Look at how
burnt... what is she doing?

25:04.230 --> 25:05.396
Damn.

25:06.666 --> 25:08.532
Um, too hot.

25:08.567 --> 25:11.068
This is a scallop dish.
What am I gonna do here?

25:11.103 --> 25:13.871
Does anyone have
any extra scallops?

25:13.906 --> 25:15.739
You have any shucked ones
that are...

25:15.775 --> 25:17.541
- No.
- No shucked?

25:17.576 --> 25:18.776
How much time to go?

25:18.811 --> 25:20.344
Last five minutes.

25:26.158 --> 25:29.293
I burned some of them.

25:29.328 --> 25:31.095
<i>These scallops are way burned.</i>

25:31.130 --> 25:32.630
I can't serve this
to the judges.

25:32.665 --> 25:34.031
Last five minutes, guys.

25:34.066 --> 25:35.766
Does anyone
have any extra scallops

25:35.801 --> 25:37.601
that they shucked?
Anyone?

25:37.637 --> 25:39.237
Annabelle, I got two
that I didn't shuck!

25:39.272 --> 25:41.305
- Avery, I need them!
- Okay.

25:41.340 --> 25:43.340
- Thank you.
- Here's two. There you go.

25:43.376 --> 25:45.053
I only have a few minutes left,
but I'm gonna try

25:45.077 --> 25:47.778
to get back on track
and get these scallops cooked.

25:47.813 --> 25:50.281
Don't worry about it, Annabelle.
Keep calm.

25:50.316 --> 25:52.316
Three minutes to go, guys.

25:54.253 --> 25:55.920
Oh, my God.

25:55.955 --> 25:57.888
You've got to start plating.

25:57.924 --> 26:00.858
Okay, start plating.

26:00.893 --> 26:02.504
Ian's been
falling apart back there.

26:02.528 --> 26:03.827
I'm so nervous.

26:03.863 --> 26:05.073
You think there's any way
he can pull this back?

26:05.097 --> 26:06.141
There's only, literally,
minutes to go,

26:06.165 --> 26:08.699
- but don't give up.
- Right.

26:08.734 --> 26:11.135
Faster.

26:11.170 --> 26:13.070
Wipe, garnish, taste!

26:13.105 --> 26:14.738
90 seconds to go, guys.
Come on!

26:17.109 --> 26:18.842
Make it look stunning!

26:18.878 --> 26:20.978
Get the food on the plate, guys!

26:21.013 --> 26:22.124
Annabelle, just get it
on the plate.

26:22.148 --> 26:23.714
- Get it on the plate.
- I will.

26:23.749 --> 26:25.215
Finishing touches!

26:25.251 --> 26:27.229
Taste everything
before you put it on the plate!

26:27.253 --> 26:28.953
Come on, guys! Let's go!

26:28.988 --> 26:31.956
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

26:31.991 --> 26:34.892
six, five, four,

26:34.927 --> 26:36.994
three, two, one.

26:37.029 --> 26:38.128
And stop!

26:38.164 --> 26:39.296
Hands in the air!

26:39.332 --> 26:41.532
Well done!

26:41.567 --> 26:42.900
Nice.

26:42.935 --> 26:44.268
Now for the exciting part.

26:44.303 --> 26:46.437
The tastes of those
extraordinary scallop dishes.

26:46.472 --> 26:49.273
Let's start with
Tae-Ho, please. Let's go.

26:50.876 --> 26:52.977
<i>I see Tae-Ho's dish
and it's, like, a risotto.</i>

26:53.012 --> 26:57.281
I'm like, "How do you
pull off a risotto?"

26:57.316 --> 27:00.551
Dude, you're a good chef.

27:00.586 --> 27:02.686
Right, young man,
describe the dish please.

27:02.722 --> 27:04.922
I made seared scallops
over lemon risotto

27:04.957 --> 27:08.125
with a jalapeño poblano
pepper salsa on top

27:08.160 --> 27:10.628
with a beetroot and Brussels
sprout leaf garnish.

27:10.663 --> 27:12.630
It's vibrant.
It's got those wonderful colors,

27:12.665 --> 27:13.842
and who taught you
how to make a risotto?

27:13.866 --> 27:15.432
I actually learned
how to make a risotto

27:15.468 --> 27:16.600
from a cookbook

27:16.636 --> 27:17.946
that was actually
one of your cookbooks.

27:17.970 --> 27:19.236
Right.

27:19.271 --> 27:21.238
And also, I had a lot of help
from my mom, too.

27:21.273 --> 27:23.173
Wow, so you made
a salsa, a risotto,

27:23.209 --> 27:25.509
cooked the scallops,
fried the beetroot chips,

27:25.544 --> 27:27.778
and then the Brussels sprout
leaves as well.

27:27.813 --> 27:29.046
Mm-hmm.

27:29.081 --> 27:30.514
And how did you cook
the scallops?

27:30.549 --> 27:32.461
I pan-seared them when the pan
was really, really hot

27:32.485 --> 27:34.418
and I seasoned them
with salt and pepper.

27:34.453 --> 27:36.920
Mm.
Risotto's delicious.

27:36.956 --> 27:38.489
Fragrant with a nice heat.

27:38.524 --> 27:41.191
Scallops cooked beautifully,
seared on both sides as well.

27:41.227 --> 27:42.960
Always a sign of a great chef,

27:42.995 --> 27:45.329
but the fact that you've got
so many technical abilities

27:45.364 --> 27:47.064
nailed in one plate...
Great job.

27:47.099 --> 27:49.566
- Well done.
- Thank you, Chef.

27:50.736 --> 27:53.671
<i>Gordon Ramsay loved my dish!</i>

27:53.706 --> 27:54.938
<i>He's my idol.</i>

27:54.974 --> 27:56.674
<i>He's the reason
I started cooking,</i>

27:56.709 --> 27:59.476
so this is a huge honor for me.

27:59.512 --> 28:00.678
Yes.

28:00.713 --> 28:03.380
Next up, from Philadelphia,
it's Nate.

28:03.416 --> 28:04.982
Bring it on up.

28:05.017 --> 28:06.283
<i>I love seafood.</i>

28:06.318 --> 28:08.285
<i>I could eat scallops
all day every day,</i>

28:08.320 --> 28:10.120
<i>24/7, 365...</i>

28:10.156 --> 28:11.855
It's so good.
I love it.

28:11.891 --> 28:14.158
What did you make
with those scallops?

28:14.193 --> 28:16.894
Today, I have for you
a pan-seared scallops

28:16.929 --> 28:20.330
with a cauliflower mash
and Brussels sprout leaf

28:20.366 --> 28:22.533
and spinach combo
with a bit of bechamel.

28:22.568 --> 28:25.469
So, you're from
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

28:25.504 --> 28:27.571
How do these scallops fit in?

28:27.606 --> 28:29.707
I have a shore house
in New Jersey

28:29.742 --> 28:31.408
and we go fishing a lot.

28:31.444 --> 28:32.843
Have you ever dived
for scallops?

28:32.878 --> 28:36.380
Nope, but I've crabbed
for crabs.

28:36.415 --> 28:38.293
Your scallops
are cooked beautifully.

28:38.317 --> 28:39.383
Thank you.

28:39.418 --> 28:40.495
You have a nice,
even sear-around.

28:40.519 --> 28:41.985
You've seasoned the scallops.

28:42.021 --> 28:43.554
Cauliflower mash
could use something

28:43.589 --> 28:45.200
to help zing it up.
Maybe some lemon zest.

28:45.224 --> 28:46.390
Yes, yes.

28:46.425 --> 28:47.703
But you really did
allow the scallop

28:47.727 --> 28:48.859
to be the star.

28:48.894 --> 28:50.127
- Thank you.
- Good job, Nate.

28:54.567 --> 28:58.502
Next up, from New York:
Chad.

28:58.537 --> 29:01.205
<i>I'm only 9 years old,
but I'm really creative,</i>

29:01.240 --> 29:05.109
and today, I'm doing a take
on an Italian surf and turf.

29:05.144 --> 29:07.311
<i>I've never seen anything
like this.</i>

29:07.346 --> 29:09.213
Tell me what we have.

29:09.248 --> 29:11.871
<i>This is a pan-seared scallop
spaghetti and meatballs</i>

29:11.951 --> 29:14.318
<i>garnished
with parmesan Romano cheese</i>

29:14.353 --> 29:15.719
<i>and a homemade tomato sauce.</i>

29:15.755 --> 29:16.954
<i>All right.</i>

29:16.989 --> 29:18.655
What'd you do
with the tomato sauce?

29:18.691 --> 29:21.759
First, I diced tomatoes
and then put a little bit

29:21.794 --> 29:24.962
of chicken stock
and then I used crushed tomatoes

29:24.997 --> 29:27.030
to get that saucy texture.

29:31.203 --> 29:33.270
So, the sauce it good.
Sauce is cooked great.

29:33.305 --> 29:36.440
The problem I have
is the actual idea

29:36.475 --> 29:39.810
behind the dish
because spaghetti and meatballs,

29:39.845 --> 29:42.012
classic combination, right?

29:42.047 --> 29:46.083
But spaghetti and meatballs
with scallops,

29:46.118 --> 29:49.219
never heard of that,
and the reason is because

29:49.255 --> 29:52.956
the scallop is so delicate
and sweet that,

29:52.992 --> 29:56.160
when you pair it next
to something as spicy

29:56.195 --> 29:59.596
and big and meaty
as a meatball, they get lost.

29:59.632 --> 30:04.067
The other thing you can see is
that the scallops are overcooked

30:04.103 --> 30:06.436
because they're so thin.

30:06.472 --> 30:08.138
Thanks, Chad.

30:14.113 --> 30:18.115
Next up, he is our youngest boy.
Ian!

30:18.150 --> 30:20.751
- Thank you.
- Let's go!

30:20.786 --> 30:22.619
<i>I struggled
through this challenge</i>

30:22.655 --> 30:24.988
because I sometimes
get nervous when I'm cooking

30:25.024 --> 30:28.625
'cause it's a competition
with Gordon Ramsay in it,

30:28.661 --> 30:30.360
<i>and the last thing I want to do</i>

30:30.396 --> 30:33.697
is serve Gordon Ramsay
bad scallops.

30:33.732 --> 30:35.132
Wow.

30:35.167 --> 30:37.835
First of all, I'm amazed
we've got something

30:37.870 --> 30:40.204
on the plate.

30:40.239 --> 30:45.442
Ten minutes ago,
I thought you'd given up.

30:45.477 --> 30:46.822
Did you come
into MasterChef Junior

30:46.846 --> 30:48.011
to give up?

30:55.981 --> 30:59.450
First of all,
I'm amazed we've got something

30:59.485 --> 31:03.587
on the plate because
I thought you'd given up.

31:03.622 --> 31:04.633
Did you come
into MasterChef Junior

31:04.657 --> 31:06.356
- to give up?
- No.

31:06.392 --> 31:08.125
So what happened?

31:08.160 --> 31:09.404
I was starting
to get kind of nervous

31:09.428 --> 31:11.562
about my scallops
because I couldn't get those...

31:11.597 --> 31:13.130
- Yes.
- Out of the thing so...

31:13.165 --> 31:15.377
- And you got frustrated, right?
- Yeah, a little bit, chef.

31:15.401 --> 31:18.235
In this competition, young man,
it's not how you start,

31:18.270 --> 31:19.303
it's how you finish,

31:19.338 --> 31:20.838
so describe the dish please.

31:20.873 --> 31:23.740
It's pan-seared scallops
served with zucchini cakes

31:23.776 --> 31:25.642
topped with micro-greens.

31:25.678 --> 31:26.922
Uh, visually,
it looks like something

31:26.946 --> 31:28.645
out of a, sort of,
cool gastro-pub

31:28.681 --> 31:30.013
because it looks beautiful.

31:30.049 --> 31:32.816
What else is inside
the zucchini cakes?

31:32.852 --> 31:35.119
Grated parmesan cheese
and flour.

31:38.958 --> 31:41.125
So here's the thing.

31:43.462 --> 31:45.006
You have absolutely nailed
the scallops.

31:45.030 --> 31:46.396
Thank you.

31:46.432 --> 31:48.510
Great sear on the top
and a great sear on the bottom.

31:48.534 --> 31:49.700
Thank you.

31:49.735 --> 31:51.635
However, zucchini
needs more salt

31:51.670 --> 31:53.110
just to lift it a little bit.
Okay.

31:53.139 --> 31:55.072
But well done for not giving up

31:55.107 --> 31:56.640
and next time you find a bump,

31:56.675 --> 31:58.509
get off your butt
and bounce back.

31:58.544 --> 32:00.210
- Got me?
- Yes, sir.

32:00.246 --> 32:02.679
Good man.
Thank you.

32:04.850 --> 32:06.683
It's not the best dish
of the night,

32:06.719 --> 32:08.085
but it's not the worst.

32:08.120 --> 32:11.054
I'm, like, right here.

32:11.090 --> 32:12.956
- Great job, Ian.
- Good job, Ian.

32:12.992 --> 32:16.460
But I'll take that
as long as I don't go home.

32:16.495 --> 32:20.164
Next up, from Arizona:
Vivian.

32:22.568 --> 32:24.134
Tell me about the dish.

32:24.170 --> 32:26.203
You have parmesan-crusted
scallops

32:26.238 --> 32:30.107
with a lemon and lime couscous
and a bacon and corn relish.

32:34.013 --> 32:35.946
The couscous
has been seasoned nicely.

32:35.981 --> 32:37.481
The bacon is crispy.

32:37.516 --> 32:40.951
Unfortunately, the scallop
really isn't seared properly

32:40.986 --> 32:43.887
and therefore it's really
just lost in the dish.

32:43.923 --> 32:45.155
Thank you.

32:45.191 --> 32:46.791
- Derek, let's go, please.
- Yeah, Derek!

32:49.028 --> 32:50.594
Describe the dish, please.

32:50.629 --> 32:53.597
It is pan-seared scallops
over Israeli couscous

32:53.632 --> 32:56.567
in carrot purée
with an herb pesto.

32:59.071 --> 33:01.205
It's a beautiful sear
on the scallops.

33:01.240 --> 33:02.617
<i>You've got that nice
combination between the rich</i>

33:02.641 --> 33:04.241
and the sweetness
of the scallops

33:04.276 --> 33:06.910
and that herby, basil pesto.

33:06.946 --> 33:09.279
Just a touch more salt,
and that's how close you are

33:09.315 --> 33:10.847
to an absolutely perfected dish.

33:10.883 --> 33:13.217
Next up, Kamilly.

33:15.221 --> 33:17.888
I made California scallops
on a bed of spinach

33:17.923 --> 33:23.060
with some avocado lime sauce
and quinoa on the side.

33:27.666 --> 33:30.867
The quinoa is a little strange
to pair with scallops.

33:30.903 --> 33:32.447
Take a look at these scallops,
it looks like

33:32.471 --> 33:35.939
they've been seasoned nicely,
but ideally you have the sort of

33:35.975 --> 33:38.108
same golden brown color
on both the top

33:38.143 --> 33:39.843
and the bottom of your scallop.

33:39.878 --> 33:40.944
Thank you.

33:42.514 --> 33:44.826
<i>I'm really nervous because two
people are going home tonight,</i>

33:44.850 --> 33:46.516
and my scallops
were not cooked well.

33:46.552 --> 33:49.219
<i>I don't want to go back
to my fifth grade math class.</i>

33:49.255 --> 33:51.822
I want to stay
in this classroom.

33:51.857 --> 33:54.758
All right, next up please.
Amaya.

33:56.695 --> 33:58.829
Please, describe your dish.

33:58.864 --> 34:01.498
Today, I have for you
pan-seared scallops

34:01.533 --> 34:03.967
with grilled asparagus
and bechamel sauce

34:04.003 --> 34:05.936
that should just leave

34:05.971 --> 34:08.639
an explosion of flavors
in your mouth.

34:08.674 --> 34:11.742
Now, what kind of style
would you say that Amaya has?

34:11.777 --> 34:14.011
- I have a lot of improv...
- Okay.

34:14.045 --> 34:15.411
In my step.

34:15.447 --> 34:18.614
I like cooking Dominican foods
as well as American food.

34:18.650 --> 34:20.083
Awesome.
Here's the thing:

34:20.119 --> 34:21.818
You've got all this sauce
over the top,

34:21.853 --> 34:24.288
but now, when I go like this
and I scrape it off,

34:24.322 --> 34:26.956
look at how gorgeous
that thing is.

34:26.992 --> 34:28.458
Why would you want to hide it?

34:28.494 --> 34:31.094
Next time, sauce on the bottom,
scallop on top,

34:31.130 --> 34:33.697
so that you can tell everybody,
like, look how amazing

34:33.732 --> 34:36.867
your scallop was.

34:36.902 --> 34:39.369
And it is exactly that.
It's delicious.

34:39.405 --> 34:41.438
Great dish, really tasty.

34:41.473 --> 34:43.106
Work on the presentation
a little, right?

34:43.141 --> 34:45.242
- Good job. Thank you, Amaya.
- Yes, sir.

34:47.413 --> 34:49.513
And finally, Annabelle, please.
Let's go.

34:49.547 --> 34:50.947
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

34:50.983 --> 34:52.293
- Let's go, Annabelle.
- Let's go!

34:52.318 --> 34:53.795
I'm pretty impressed
that Annabelle was not only

34:53.819 --> 34:55.985
able to get everything
on the plate.

34:56.021 --> 34:58.455
<i>She was able
to do the scallops two ways.</i>

34:58.490 --> 35:02.693
That is something
that I find quite impressive.

35:02.728 --> 35:03.972
Annabelle,
describe the dish, please

35:03.996 --> 35:05.562
I made scallops two ways.

35:05.597 --> 35:09.232
<i>One way is scallop seviche
with lemon and cilantro</i>

35:09.268 --> 35:10.812
<i>and the other one
is pan-seared scallops</i>

35:10.836 --> 35:12.602
<i>with zucchini sauce.</i>

35:12.638 --> 35:14.404
Wow, and why two ways?

35:14.440 --> 35:17.407
'Cause I like making things
lots of different ways.

35:17.443 --> 35:21.411
But cooking scallops
are hard enough.

35:21.447 --> 35:24.281
Why sudden jeopardy tonight
when you know

35:24.316 --> 35:26.049
at least two of you
going home tonight?

35:27.619 --> 35:29.453
Why would you risk so much?

35:45.457 --> 35:48.391
So, cooking scallops two ways,

35:48.426 --> 35:50.504
it's a very bold thing to do.

35:50.584 --> 35:52.551
Why would you risk so much?

35:52.586 --> 35:55.454
- I'm not sure.
- You're not sure.

35:55.489 --> 35:57.622
Let's try the seviche first,

35:57.658 --> 35:59.724
and what's in here again?
Any vinegar?

35:59.760 --> 36:01.159
No.
There's water, there's lemon,

36:01.195 --> 36:03.328
there's cumin,
there's mustard seeds,

36:03.363 --> 36:06.832
and there's radish.

36:06.867 --> 36:09.067
So, a seviche
is never done with water,

36:09.103 --> 36:10.413
so unfortunately,
there's no real strength

36:10.437 --> 36:12.404
to the flavor
coming through there.

36:12.439 --> 36:14.773
Now, these ones;
How long'd you cook these for?

36:14.808 --> 36:16.341
Just until they're browned.

36:16.376 --> 36:19.911
- Did you have a time on there?
- No, I didn't.

36:19.947 --> 36:25.417
Unfortunately,
they're overcooked.

36:25.452 --> 36:27.652
I think the purée is delicious.

36:27.688 --> 36:29.988
Unfortunately,
the hero being the scallops,

36:30.023 --> 36:32.157
they really haven't delivered.

36:32.192 --> 36:34.759
Sometimes, it's important
to hold back

36:34.795 --> 36:37.062
and get one way perfectly done

36:37.097 --> 36:38.663
and then
when you're strong enough,

36:38.699 --> 36:40.732
bring on a second idea,

36:40.767 --> 36:43.068
but a very bold,
personal effort.

36:43.103 --> 36:44.803
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

36:54.481 --> 36:56.982
Please give us a moment
while we have

36:57.017 --> 37:01.019
a very serious discussion.
Thank you.

37:01.054 --> 37:02.554
Oh, my God.

37:02.589 --> 37:04.289
Man, he's a serious man, dude.

37:04.324 --> 37:06.324
Great dishes, I mean,
tremendous dishes.

37:06.360 --> 37:07.492
- Tae-Ho.
- Yeah?

37:07.528 --> 37:09.027
I mean, that was incredible.

37:09.062 --> 37:11.396
That risotto was delicious.
What about Derek's?

37:11.431 --> 37:12.764
So much technique on one plate.

37:12.799 --> 37:14.966
So smart, so beautifully plated.

37:15.002 --> 37:16.368
- Amaya?
- Little messy, or no?

37:16.403 --> 37:18.181
Ah, just a little
bit too much cream sauce.

37:18.205 --> 37:20.105
<i>My dishes make sense.</i>

37:20.140 --> 37:21.740
Chad's was all over the place.

37:21.775 --> 37:23.520
<i>If it was a meatball
challenge, he'd win,</i>

37:23.544 --> 37:25.310
<i>but the fact is, I mean,
two little tiny bits</i>

37:25.345 --> 37:27.212
<i>of scallop lost in tomato sauce.</i>

37:27.247 --> 37:29.681
I didn't even
cook my scallops right.

37:29.716 --> 37:30.882
What about Vivian?

37:30.918 --> 37:32.228
She was so smart
to pair her scallop

37:32.252 --> 37:34.719
with bacon, corn,
but overall just fell short.

37:34.755 --> 37:35.820
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

37:35.856 --> 37:36.955
Happy with those?

37:36.990 --> 37:39.558
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm. Makes sense.

37:44.464 --> 37:47.999
You all did an amazing job.

37:49.603 --> 37:54.272
Tonight's winning dish
goes to...

37:55.842 --> 37:57.442
Tae-Ho.

37:57.477 --> 37:59.010
- Whoo!
- Nice job.

37:59.046 --> 38:00.512
Yeah, Tae-Ho!

38:00.547 --> 38:03.148
We were all blown away, Tae-Ho.

38:03.183 --> 38:04.783
Thank you, Chef.

38:04.818 --> 38:08.820
But as we all know,
this is a competition

38:08.855 --> 38:13.124
and unfortunately,
we do have to say good-bye

38:13.160 --> 38:15.360
to some very, very talented
young home cooks.

38:17.197 --> 38:20.031
Would the following four
home cooks come down here

38:20.067 --> 38:22.167
to the front?

38:22.202 --> 38:26.538
Kamilly.
Chad, join us up front please.

38:28.642 --> 38:30.008
Annabelle.

38:33.113 --> 38:36.681
And finally, Vivian.

38:44.925 --> 38:48.026
You are all incredibly talented,
young home cooks.

38:48.061 --> 38:49.094
Let's get that right.

38:51.999 --> 38:55.166
Sadly, there are two of you
who will be going home

38:55.202 --> 38:57.535
this evening.

38:57.571 --> 39:02.974
This isn't easy at all.

39:03.010 --> 39:05.543
Kamilly and Vivian,
step forward please.

39:08.582 --> 39:13.785
Kamilly and Vivian,
those dishes tonight

39:13.820 --> 39:15.720
were not perfect.

39:20.560 --> 39:23.261
But they weren't the worst.

39:23.297 --> 39:25.563
Please, both of you,
head back to your stations.

39:27.801 --> 39:30.135
I feel so relieved,
but at the same time,

39:30.170 --> 39:34.472
I feel so sorry for Annabelle
and Chad right now.

39:38.345 --> 39:42.914
Annabelle and Chad, I'm sorry,
but tonight,

39:42.949 --> 39:46.651
those scallop dishes
just got the better of you.

39:46.687 --> 39:50.322
It may be your last cook-off
in the MasterChef kitchen,

39:50.357 --> 39:52.624
but your food journey
will continue.

39:52.659 --> 39:54.793
Wear those aprons with pride

39:54.912 --> 39:58.563
and stay focused on
what you want to do with food

39:58.598 --> 40:01.433
because you're both good enough.

40:01.468 --> 40:04.936
Both of you, well done.

40:04.971 --> 40:07.405
Whoo!

40:07.441 --> 40:08.840
Good night, guys.

40:11.511 --> 40:13.144
You're not going anywhere
without me.

40:13.180 --> 40:14.713
You're staying right here.

40:14.748 --> 40:16.381
I'm sad to go home,
but this is one

40:16.416 --> 40:18.083
of the greatest things
I've ever done.

40:18.118 --> 40:20.051
<i>I cooked for Gordon Ramsay,</i>

40:20.087 --> 40:21.986
one of the toughest chefs
in the world.

40:22.022 --> 40:23.588
<i>I am so proud of myself.</i>

40:23.623 --> 40:25.790
Chad, you did a great job!

40:25.826 --> 40:27.003
You're wearing
a MasterChef apron.

40:27.027 --> 40:29.761
Remember that.
Hold your head high, okay?

40:29.796 --> 40:31.229
Even though I'm going home
tonight

40:31.264 --> 40:32.764
back to Poughkeepsie, New York,

40:32.799 --> 40:34.599
<i>I still have a whole bunch
of bragging rights</i>

40:34.634 --> 40:37.001
and I still have
my MasterChef apron.

40:37.037 --> 40:38.403
<i>How many people can say that?</i>

40:38.438 --> 40:40.872
That is the symbol of greatness.

40:40.907 --> 40:43.808
I had a really good time
being on MasterChef Junior.

40:43.844 --> 40:45.977
I made a whole bunch of friends.

40:46.012 --> 40:47.412
<i>My experience here,</i>

40:47.447 --> 40:49.481
it'll be a part of me forever.

40:49.516 --> 40:51.916
Bye, guys.
You did a great job!

40:51.952 --> 40:53.633
We love ya!

40:53.713 --> 40:55.583
Can we hug them more?

40:55.743 --> 40:57.444
Next week...

40:58.713 --> 41:00.547
<i>The competition blasts off.</i>

41:00.581 --> 41:02.883
<i>That's one, small step for man.</i>

41:02.917 --> 41:05.419
<i>One giant leap for</i> MasterChef.

41:05.453 --> 41:07.287
- Whoa.
- That is awesome.

41:07.322 --> 41:09.066

challenge.</i>

41:11.526 --> 41:14.361
Make the very best cheese dish

<i>Who will rocket to the top?</i>

41:16.364 --> 41:17.998
<i>Absolutely perfectly done.</i>

41:18.032 --> 41:20.767

- Thank you.

41:20.802 --> 41:22.746
<i>And whose journey
will have a crash landing?</i>

41:22.770 --> 41:25.138
- What have you put in there?
- I forgot to season it.
