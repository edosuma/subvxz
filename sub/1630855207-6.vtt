00:01.584 --> 00:05.005
Okay. This pile is to keep.
This pile is to throw away.

00:05.005 --> 00:08.383
For example, I will keep these muffins.

00:08.383 --> 00:10.760
I will throw away that apron.

00:10.760 --> 00:15.306
Uh, actually, I will keep this apron.

00:15.306 --> 00:16.391
Yes.

00:17.642 --> 00:19.978
- What's that pile?
- I thought that was yours.

00:19.978 --> 00:22.105
No, none of this is mine.

00:22.105 --> 00:26.234
Oh. Then I'll just add it on
to the keep pile.

00:31.698 --> 00:34.868
And what of the pendant?
What are your plans for that now?

00:36.161 --> 00:38.163
If it is the Fourth Scroll,

00:38.747 --> 00:41.124
legend says
we need my father's staff to open it.

00:41.708 --> 00:44.210
But Niu Mowang has that.

00:45.086 --> 00:47.797
Wei-Chen,
is that the only thing bothering you?

00:48.381 --> 00:50.467
I just...

00:50.467 --> 00:54.054
...didn't expect that getting this...
I would lose my friend.

00:55.430 --> 00:56.806
I think I hurt Jin.

01:00.852 --> 01:03.313
I promised not to get involved,

01:03.813 --> 01:07.525
but I can offer you this, just once.

01:08.526 --> 01:11.988
I will bring your pendant to Lady Rocky.

01:12.822 --> 01:14.240
Lady Rocky?

01:14.240 --> 01:15.909
She gave herself that name.

01:16.534 --> 01:18.203
Her real name is Shi Ji.

01:18.203 --> 01:20.288
She's all about stones.

01:21.372 --> 01:24.459
She's a bit much,
but she may be able to help.

01:25.376 --> 01:27.962
At least we'll know
if your quest is actually complete.

01:28.963 --> 01:30.465
Thank you, Guanyin-<i>pusa</i>.

01:30.465 --> 01:33.259
No need to thank me. Just help me clean.

01:33.259 --> 01:34.552
Okay.

01:39.015 --> 01:42.018
Do you want me to throw away
these old soy sauce packets?

01:42.018 --> 01:43.520
Are you crazy?

01:55.073 --> 01:58.284
All right,
what animal has the fastest metabolism?

01:58.284 --> 02:00.703
And no,
it is not Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson.

02:01.871 --> 02:03.081
It's the hummingbird.

02:03.790 --> 02:04.791
Pretty amazing, huh?

02:05.959 --> 02:10.004
All right, enough fun.
Let's make like proteins and synthesize.

02:15.135 --> 02:17.303
- Hey, is everything okay?
- Yeah, why?

02:17.303 --> 02:19.722
Nothing. You've just been
a little distant lately, that's all.

02:19.722 --> 02:22.892
Oh, sorry. Yeah, it's not you.
It's just some other stuff.

02:22.892 --> 02:26.604
Got it. Um, do you wanna talk to me
about other stuff?

02:27.188 --> 02:28.523
Do you know that kid Wei-Chen?

02:28.523 --> 02:30.483
Yeah, but I haven't seen him
in a few weeks.

02:30.483 --> 02:32.944
- Didn't he go home?
- Uh, he went home but then he came back.

02:32.944 --> 02:35.947
Um, we kinda got into a thing
after I left your house the other night.

02:35.947 --> 02:38.366
- Thing? What kind of thing? Like a fight?
- Kind of.

02:39.117 --> 02:40.743
Oh, he seemed really nice.

02:40.743 --> 02:44.289
Yeah, well, I guess some people
just aren't what they seem.

02:44.289 --> 02:48.042
Well, do you wanna finish this project
after school today?

02:48.042 --> 02:50.962
I do, but I can't tonight.

02:50.962 --> 02:52.839
- Why not?
- It's my birthday.

02:52.839 --> 02:54.716
- What?
- Yeah.

02:54.716 --> 02:57.677
- Are you gonna do anything to celebrate?
- No, it's not a big deal in my house.

02:57.677 --> 02:59.762
My mom just makes these noodles
that taste like nothing

02:59.762 --> 03:01.764
- and then my dad gives me 20 bucks.
- Mmm.

03:01.764 --> 03:04.058
Well, my mom just makes
practice cakes for the entire month

03:04.058 --> 03:06.102
and then my dad eats them all
just to be nice.

03:06.102 --> 03:08.646
- That's cool.
- No, it's weird.

03:08.646 --> 03:12.275
- Yeah, I guess it's kinda weird.
- But seriously, you should do something.

03:12.275 --> 03:14.319
It's the one day
you get to celebrate yourself.

03:14.319 --> 03:17.780
- Right. Yeah, we don't really do that.
- Oh! We should go bowling.

03:17.780 --> 03:19.574
What?
Amelia, I'm not turning 50.

03:19.574 --> 03:22.160
Me and Ruby found this place,
and they make it all futuristic.

03:22.160 --> 03:23.995
Futuristic as in everybody there is 50?

03:23.995 --> 03:26.998
Stop.
Look, are you sure you can't do tonight?

03:29.292 --> 03:30.710
Yeah, I guess the noodles can wait.

03:30.710 --> 03:33.504
Perfect. Okay, I will invite people
and this will be fun. Promise.

03:33.504 --> 03:34.797
Okay.

03:44.599 --> 03:47.852
They're exquisite.

03:47.852 --> 03:50.396
Yes. One of a kind.

03:50.396 --> 03:52.273
- How much?
- Oh, they're not for sale.

03:53.441 --> 03:55.318
What do you mean
they're not for sale?

03:55.318 --> 03:58.863
The stones were forged in White Bone Cave
during the Qing Dynasty.

03:58.863 --> 04:00.615
I bring them out simply to admire.

04:01.491 --> 04:02.533
Name your price.

04:02.533 --> 04:05.870
It's really not about money.

04:06.371 --> 04:08.623
- Anyway, I'm actually closing.
- 20,000.

04:08.623 --> 04:11.501
I'm sorry.

04:12.502 --> 04:14.254
Fifty then, for the pair.

04:14.254 --> 04:15.755
Oh.

04:15.755 --> 04:18.508
Well, they do look magnificent on you,

04:19.842 --> 04:21.803
but what would my ancestors say?

04:23.179 --> 04:24.722
100,000.

04:24.722 --> 04:26.724
Let me wrap those up for you.

04:38.987 --> 04:40.446
One of a kind, huh?

04:42.991 --> 04:45.201
Guanyin-<i>pusa</i>.

04:45.201 --> 04:47.870
It's nice to see you again, Shi Ji.

04:47.870 --> 04:51.457
Putting your skills to work, I see.

04:51.457 --> 04:53.960
Well, you know, gotta feed the beast.

04:55.628 --> 04:57.755
- You remember Pixiu, right?
- Mm-hmm.

04:57.755 --> 04:59.799
Come here.

04:59.799 --> 05:02.135
This is Pixiu?

05:02.135 --> 05:04.137
He looks different.

05:04.137 --> 05:06.431
Oh, yeah. The Jade Emperor did that.

05:06.431 --> 05:08.266
After Pixiu pooped in his lotus pond,

05:08.266 --> 05:10.601
he turned him into a dog
and sealed his anus.

05:11.936 --> 05:14.439
Anyway, we're not banished per se,

05:14.439 --> 05:17.817
we're just not exactly welcome
to all the fancy banquets.

05:17.817 --> 05:18.943
It's fine.

05:18.943 --> 05:21.446
Pixiu prefers Earth stones, to be honest.

05:21.946 --> 05:23.906
Anything celestial, he can't keep down.

05:23.906 --> 05:26.576
Isn't that right?
It makes his little tummy hurt.

05:27.076 --> 05:30.079
So, what can I help you with,
Guanyin-<i>pusa</i>?

05:30.079 --> 05:34.125
I need to ask you a question
about a stone we've discovered.

05:34.834 --> 05:36.169
Two stones actually,

05:37.128 --> 05:38.463
set together.

05:39.464 --> 05:40.631
What do you need to know?

05:41.466 --> 05:44.469
Whether this is the Fourth Scroll.

06:07.325 --> 06:10.370
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey. I'll make your noodles in a bit.

06:10.370 --> 06:15.041
Oh. Uh, actually, I'm gonna
probably go out tonight, if that's okay?

06:15.041 --> 06:16.959
Some friends
are throwing me a birthday thing.

06:16.959 --> 06:19.796
Oh, that's nice.
Ask Daddy to drive you there.

06:20.338 --> 06:22.215
Have fun, but not too late, hmm?

06:24.092 --> 06:26.052
- Can I ask you a question, Mom?
- Yeah, what's that?

06:28.054 --> 06:29.847
How much money did you spend
on the green stuff?

06:32.100 --> 06:35.520
Jin-<i>ah</i>, Daddy and I
wasn't arguing about money.

06:35.520 --> 06:37.188
Okay, then what were you arguing about?

06:37.188 --> 06:38.689
You know...

06:38.689 --> 06:43.236
...when I first met your daddy,
he had a lot of big ideas, big hopes.

06:43.236 --> 06:44.487
I liked that.

06:44.487 --> 06:46.906
And his deep voice.

06:47.657 --> 06:49.117
I liked that too.

06:50.701 --> 06:52.870
But now when I look at him...

06:52.870 --> 06:57.083
...sometimes I don't recognize
the man I married.

06:58.793 --> 07:00.128
Where did he go?

07:06.259 --> 07:08.094
- Hey, Dad?
- Hmm?

07:08.094 --> 07:10.388
- Can I ask you a question?
- Hmm?

07:12.557 --> 07:13.641
Do you think it's possible

07:13.641 --> 07:15.977
that Mom's green powder
is actually a good investment?

07:15.977 --> 07:17.270
Jin,

07:18.146 --> 07:20.481
- do you know what is an investment?
- Yeah.

07:20.481 --> 07:23.860
It's when you put capital into something
and then later you get something back.

07:23.860 --> 07:26.279
<i>The green powder is not an investment.</i>

07:26.279 --> 07:28.156
<i>It's a silly drink.</i>

07:28.156 --> 07:30.867
Well, maybe he just thinks
it's kinda risky, you know?

07:30.867 --> 07:32.952
'Cause you don't even really know
what's in it, right?

07:32.952 --> 07:35.246
Do you know what's in the energy drink
you have there?

07:36.330 --> 07:38.541
I-- I don't-- I don't know.

07:39.041 --> 07:41.961
<i>See?
That's how business works sometimes, huh?</i>

07:41.961 --> 07:44.088
Well, I feel like
she really believes in it.

07:44.088 --> 07:47.508
And I think she thinks that other people
are gonna believe in it too.

07:47.508 --> 07:50.261
<i>If she just wants to believe,
she should go to church,</i>

07:50.261 --> 07:51.512
<i>not start a business.</i>

07:51.512 --> 07:53.473
<i>If Daddy wants just to work hard,</i>

07:53.473 --> 07:55.057
<i>he should not have left home.</i>

07:55.641 --> 07:57.268
We came here for something new.

07:57.268 --> 07:59.896
<i>Your mother doesn't understand
how things work.</i>

08:01.647 --> 08:05.067
<i>Daddy doesn't know how
to take risks anymore.</i>

08:05.067 --> 08:06.861
<i>Mom said she wants to talk to you.</i>

08:06.861 --> 08:08.613
Well, Dad said he wants to talk to you.

08:08.613 --> 08:09.697
Will you at least try?

08:09.697 --> 08:11.157
Can you at least try?

08:11.157 --> 08:12.450
<i>aiya,</i>

08:12.450 --> 08:15.620
<i>he's just mad because
I lost the pendant in the restaurant.</i>

08:16.537 --> 08:18.331
I never liked it much anyway.

08:19.874 --> 08:22.543
Mom says she's really sorry
she lost the pendant.

08:24.712 --> 08:25.922
<i>She feels really bad.</i>

08:36.557 --> 08:38.434
Call when you wanna come home.

09:12.885 --> 09:15.513
- Hey, guys! Uh, sorry I'm late.
- Hey.

09:15.513 --> 09:17.682
My dad is a very slow driver.

09:17.682 --> 09:20.643
Late to your own party.
I respect the flex, man.

09:20.643 --> 09:23.104
- Of course.
- Hey, surprise, man. Look at this.

09:23.104 --> 09:26.399
Dude, not a surprise party, all right?
Not a surprise party.

09:26.399 --> 09:27.817
- Hey, Ruby.
- Hey.

09:27.817 --> 09:29.735
- Oh, hey, Jin. What's up? Look.
- Hey.

09:29.735 --> 09:31.904
I put your name as, uh, Big Wang Theory.

09:31.904 --> 09:34.865
It took him 20 minutes to come up
with that. He's very proud of it.

09:34.865 --> 09:36.284
- Well done. Well done.
- Happy birthday.

09:36.284 --> 09:37.743
Yo, Jin! Hey, buddy.

09:37.743 --> 09:39.203
- Happy birthday.
- Hey, man.

09:39.203 --> 09:40.955
Dude, glad you could make it.

09:40.955 --> 09:44.000
Yeah, of course. Wouldn't miss it.
Oh, there's a Pump It Up machine here,

09:44.000 --> 09:46.836
so it's a win-win, 'cause I'm gonna try
to break the high score.

09:46.836 --> 09:48.045
Oh, sorry.

09:48.546 --> 09:50.965
He made me watch YouTube videos
all afternoon.

09:50.965 --> 09:53.092
Well, it's research, and it helps.

09:53.092 --> 09:55.636
Got it.
Hey, uh, is Travis being cool so far?

09:55.636 --> 09:59.056
H-- He hasn't said anything yet.
I-- I think he's scared of Suzy.

09:59.056 --> 10:01.434
Every few minutes,
I give him a death stare to freak him out.

10:01.434 --> 10:02.560
Let's go.

10:04.186 --> 10:05.563
Hey, birthday boy.

10:06.522 --> 10:10.359
Hey. Um, listen,
thanks for doing all this. Really.

10:10.359 --> 10:12.820
Oh, please. I booked a couple lanes
and ordered some food.

10:12.820 --> 10:16.198
No, yeah. I noticed the Panda Express.
Is th-- Is that because--

10:16.198 --> 10:18.284
Uh, the guys insisted on it.

10:18.284 --> 10:20.119
Apparently they eat it, like,
four times a week.

10:20.119 --> 10:22.038
- Oh.
- But, um,

10:22.038 --> 10:23.789
it is mostly gone, so sorry about that.

10:23.789 --> 10:26.709
But they did give us T-shirts
'cause we ordered so many Panda Bowls.

10:26.709 --> 10:28.210
Yeah, I'm not wearing a T-shirt.

10:28.210 --> 10:30.296
Oh, I know,
because you'll be wearing this.

10:35.009 --> 10:36.010
Like it?

10:38.220 --> 10:39.680
- Hot stuff.
- Hot stuff.

10:39.680 --> 10:41.849
- I thought it just suited you, so...
- Yeah.

10:41.849 --> 10:43.768
- Thank you very much.
- ...felt you needed to have it.

10:51.275 --> 10:53.110
Let's go!

11:19.512 --> 11:23.224
Yeah! I got one. [chuckles] I got one.

11:23.808 --> 11:25.518
- Classic, classic.
- Thank you very much.

11:30.272 --> 11:31.691
Wait, why is he here?

11:31.691 --> 11:34.694
Oh, I invited him. I thought maybe
you guys could smooth things over.

11:37.405 --> 11:38.781
Hi, everyone.

11:38.781 --> 11:40.658
- Yo. What's up?
- Hey.

11:40.658 --> 11:42.034
Happy birthday.

11:43.244 --> 11:44.286
This is for you.

11:49.375 --> 11:51.377
That means "hello" in Chinese.

11:51.377 --> 11:52.878
I know.

12:01.262 --> 12:03.222
I'm flattered you came to me, Guanyin.

12:05.057 --> 12:07.435
- It's an honor to help.
- Of course.

12:07.435 --> 12:09.437
After all, you are Lady Rocky.

12:09.437 --> 12:11.856
You know,
I actually gave myself that title.

12:11.856 --> 12:13.149
Oh, interesting.

12:13.149 --> 12:17.737
So I will need to run more tests
on this pendant to know its true identity.

12:17.737 --> 12:21.449
But, uh, first,
would you like to discuss pricing?

12:21.449 --> 12:23.909
- Pricing?
- Yes. What's your offer?

12:23.909 --> 12:25.870
- My offer?
- For my services.

12:25.870 --> 12:27.830
You want payment for this?

12:27.830 --> 12:30.666
Well, you don't expect me
to operate for free, do you?

12:30.666 --> 12:35.755
Shi Ji, this could stop the uprising
and bring harmony back to Heaven.

12:36.338 --> 12:37.673
Yeah.

12:37.673 --> 12:40.050
I'm not as crazy about Heaven as some.

12:40.634 --> 12:44.180
You can't tell by looking at me,
but I actually used to be a cave demon.

12:44.180 --> 12:48.142
- That's fun.
- Oh, my gosh.

12:48.142 --> 12:51.771
I am just noticing that
beautiful bead bracelet you have there.

12:51.771 --> 12:55.399
This is a personal gift
from Nezha himself.

12:55.399 --> 12:57.234
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

12:57.735 --> 13:00.654
I'll take it,
in exchange for examining your pendant.

13:00.654 --> 13:03.783
Shi Ji, you don't want this.

13:03.783 --> 13:05.576
No, I do.

13:06.660 --> 13:10.080
How about just three beads?
You're the goddess of compassion.

13:10.664 --> 13:12.541
Think how happy this would make me.

13:12.541 --> 13:14.668
Honestly,
I didn't come here to make a deal.

13:15.252 --> 13:19.924
Okay. Well, then perhaps there's
another expert in heavenly stones around

13:19.924 --> 13:21.926
who can help you.

13:21.926 --> 13:23.010
Fine.

13:25.596 --> 13:28.098
This is not a trade, but a gift.

13:32.269 --> 13:33.479
Beautiful.

13:39.693 --> 13:41.403
Come here, sweet boy.

13:41.987 --> 13:44.532
Yes, boy.

13:44.532 --> 13:45.741
What are you doing?

13:45.741 --> 13:49.328
Oh-Oh. [shushes] He doesn't like it
when you talk while he eats.

13:51.872 --> 13:52.873
Come here.

14:06.804 --> 14:08.806
- What's happening now?
- Wow.

14:08.806 --> 14:10.015
It's just gone?

14:13.602 --> 14:16.480
I told ya.
He doesn't like celestial stones.

14:16.480 --> 14:19.358
Looks like your beads
really were from Nezha.

14:19.358 --> 14:22.111
Good boy. Yeah.

14:24.738 --> 14:27.283
We're not worthy.

14:27.283 --> 14:29.910
- We are not worthy, bro.
- Are you gonna get another one?

14:29.910 --> 14:32.413
Come on!

14:52.600 --> 14:53.976
Yeah!

14:53.976 --> 14:56.520
What? Dude, what is happening?

14:56.520 --> 14:58.147
That's gotta be
a world record, right?

14:58.147 --> 15:00.649
- Why can you do that?
- What? There's only ten of them.

15:00.649 --> 15:03.068
Okay, okay. Everybody back up.
That's my teammate.

15:03.068 --> 15:05.446
Hey, uh, Wei-Chen.
Can I talk to you for a second?

15:07.781 --> 15:09.950
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Dude, you're not gonna do it.

15:09.950 --> 15:11.076
Oh, my God.

15:13.245 --> 15:15.581
Okay. So, why are you here?

15:16.373 --> 15:17.499
Amelia invited me.

15:17.499 --> 15:20.169
No, I know. But why are you really here?

15:20.169 --> 15:22.171
I come to say happy birthday.

15:23.088 --> 15:24.673
Did you open your present yet?

15:24.673 --> 15:28.552
Yeah, you regifted me the herbal powder
my mom gave you. Very thoughtful.

15:28.552 --> 15:30.471
My guardian blessed it.

15:30.471 --> 15:32.681
- Maybe it will work magic now.
- Okay, cool. Thanks, man.

15:32.681 --> 15:34.892
Is there some other reason
you're still sticking around?

15:34.892 --> 15:37.227
Or do you just wanna find new ways
to ruin my life?

15:38.395 --> 15:40.272
I just wanna say...

15:42.358 --> 15:43.567
I'm sorry.

15:49.365 --> 15:51.033
Hey, come with me. It's not safe here.

15:51.033 --> 15:53.494
What? Dude, where are we going?

16:05.422 --> 16:08.676
Oh, great. Drunk busboy guy.
Hey, did Amelia invite you too?

16:08.676 --> 16:10.094
Don't worry. I'll handle this.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.137
Everybody out.

16:12.721 --> 16:14.932
Free slushies out there.

16:14.932 --> 16:16.058
Where is it?

16:16.058 --> 16:18.352
The toilet? Down the hall, to your left.

16:18.352 --> 16:21.105
- Perfect.
- Well, good news and bad news.

16:21.105 --> 16:25.609
The good news is I now know
where the toilet is. Thank you.

16:25.609 --> 16:28.779
Bad news is this guy.

16:34.118 --> 16:35.619
Bull Demon.

16:35.619 --> 16:40.332
What's wrong? Not excited to see me?

16:42.376 --> 16:44.753
I have a business opportunity for you.

16:44.753 --> 16:46.213
Not interested.

16:46.213 --> 16:49.550
Hear me out.

16:51.468 --> 16:53.220
You have the Fourth Scroll
but need the Staff.

16:53.220 --> 16:55.180
I have the Staff...

16:55.681 --> 16:57.641
...but need the Fourth Scroll.

16:57.641 --> 17:01.478
What if we worked together?

17:03.564 --> 17:07.860
You left home for a reason, didn't you?

17:07.860 --> 17:09.778
Please don't say anything to make him mad.

17:09.778 --> 17:11.697
Why would I work
with a weak baby like you?

17:11.697 --> 17:13.157
Feel like you didn't listen to me.

17:13.157 --> 17:15.159
Careful how you speak to me.

17:15.159 --> 17:17.786
- I'm not an idiot like Ji Gong.
- Hey.

17:17.786 --> 17:18.912
Hand it over.

17:22.833 --> 17:26.128
Leave the boy alone.

17:29.757 --> 17:30.716
Father.

17:30.716 --> 17:34.053
Have you been watching over me
this whole time?

17:34.053 --> 17:35.345
I can handle this myself.

17:35.345 --> 17:38.223
Sorry, kid.
I think I'm the one he's looking for.

17:38.223 --> 17:41.018
Been a long time, Mowang.

17:41.018 --> 17:43.645
Yeah, it certainly has.

17:43.645 --> 17:45.606
Has your anger driven you

17:46.148 --> 17:47.941
to wish for the downfall of Heaven?

17:47.941 --> 17:52.946
If I recall, that used to be your wish.

17:53.822 --> 17:54.948
Boom.

17:54.948 --> 17:58.327
Give this up. I can help you.

17:58.327 --> 18:02.164
Why would I need your help,
when I've got this...

18:02.164 --> 18:04.249
Look at what I'm holding.

18:16.303 --> 18:22.351
How's it feel?
To want something I have for once?

18:29.691 --> 18:31.860
You guys have a lot
to talk about. I should go.

18:31.860 --> 18:33.070
- I don't think so!
- No!

18:49.628 --> 18:51.004
Hurry, run!

18:53.674 --> 18:55.008
Come on.

18:57.553 --> 19:00.514
Get them!

19:07.855 --> 19:10.649
<i>Who's ready for starlight bowling?</i>

19:24.163 --> 19:25.330
Oh, there you guys are.

19:25.330 --> 19:26.248
Sandy.

19:46.768 --> 19:48.770
We're gonna sing "Happy Birthday" now.

19:48.770 --> 19:50.522
- Oh, awesome.
- And we got you a cake.

19:50.522 --> 19:52.441
- We have to get everyone out of here.
- What?

19:52.441 --> 19:54.568
Don't tell anyone
there's a demon fighting my dad.

19:54.568 --> 19:55.903
I wasn't going to.

20:17.049 --> 20:18.592
Sandy.

20:37.236 --> 20:40.948
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

20:41.531 --> 20:43.784
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

20:43.784 --> 20:46.119
<i>♪ Happy birthday, dear Jin ♪</i>

20:46.620 --> 20:49.206
All right. Candles out, party's over.
Thank you guys so much for coming.

20:49.206 --> 20:50.290
Come on.

20:50.290 --> 20:52.251
We didn't even cut the cake yet.

20:52.251 --> 20:54.920
Wait, are there nuts in that?
'Cause I might, like, you know, die.

20:54.920 --> 20:57.631
It's okay. Maybe we should eat it
out in the parking lot to be safe.

20:57.631 --> 21:00.968
It doesn't matter. I either asphyxiate
on the carpet or on the asphalt.

21:00.968 --> 21:04.471
- But thanks, Jin. I see you though.
- Come on, party. We're at a party.

21:04.471 --> 21:07.891
Wait, where the plates at?
Oh, uh, right over here.

21:33.834 --> 21:34.876
Go! Tell the others!

21:39.673 --> 21:41.383
Wukong!

22:12.414 --> 22:13.582
This is because of me.

22:20.213 --> 22:21.590
No!

22:36.813 --> 22:38.690
Our son told me you wanted to talk.

22:39.816 --> 22:43.779
He did? He told me <i>you</i> wanted to talk.

22:46.490 --> 22:49.993
That kid is a terrible liar.

22:51.244 --> 22:53.413
He gets that from you.

22:55.374 --> 22:59.920
You could never lie very well.

23:03.090 --> 23:04.424
How's the headache?

23:06.134 --> 23:07.844
Same.

23:09.262 --> 23:11.223
You should eat something.

23:15.936 --> 23:17.187
Have you eaten yet?

23:17.813 --> 23:18.647
Um...

23:18.647 --> 23:20.107
...I just ate.

23:24.111 --> 23:25.362
I'll be fine.

23:30.200 --> 23:33.745
Jin.

23:34.955 --> 23:37.874
Okay. Here is what I can tell you.

23:37.874 --> 23:40.585
This is indeed an authentic piece.

23:40.585 --> 23:43.588
It possesses two distinct forms of jade
from the warring territories,

23:43.588 --> 23:45.048
just as prophesized.

23:45.048 --> 23:46.216
That much is true.

23:46.216 --> 23:48.844
But does it possess
the power of the Fourth Scroll?

23:48.844 --> 23:51.012
For that, you'd still need <i>Jingu Bàng</i>.

23:51.012 --> 23:52.931
Until then, it's like a lock with no key.

23:54.891 --> 23:56.601
We can, of course,

23:56.601 --> 23:59.354
test to see if it has
celestial properties.

23:59.354 --> 24:01.857
You're talking about the dog.

24:01.857 --> 24:04.234
I'm talking about the dog.

24:04.234 --> 24:07.821
If he glows and spits it up, then at least
you know it's not of this world.

24:08.864 --> 24:10.073
And if it doesn't?

24:11.158 --> 24:15.787
I have a beautiful assortment
of jade pieces, all one of a kind.

24:17.164 --> 24:18.165
Sure.

24:18.165 --> 24:20.667
- Let's try it.
- Would you like to do the honors?

24:21.710 --> 24:22.794
Okay.

24:25.172 --> 24:26.256
Ah.

24:26.256 --> 24:28.842
Um, make him do a trick first.

24:28.842 --> 24:30.552
Tell him to spin or something.

24:34.014 --> 24:36.975
Spin, Pixiu. Spin.

24:39.561 --> 24:41.271
Okay. Now you can feed him.

24:41.271 --> 24:42.522
Okay. Here.

24:48.945 --> 24:51.490
Yo, Wang. We're gonna head out.
But great party, man.

24:51.490 --> 24:52.824
- Awesome.
- See you later, dude.

24:52.824 --> 24:54.868
- Yeah, see you guys at practice.
- Peace out. Awesome.

24:54.868 --> 24:56.578
- See ya.
- Hey, so we're gonna leave too.

24:56.578 --> 24:58.622
Oh, great. Awesome.
Thank you so much for coming.

24:58.622 --> 25:00.790
- I'm guessing you have lots of questions.
- What?

25:00.790 --> 25:02.292
- Yes, we're dating.
- No, we're not.

25:02.292 --> 25:04.085
Well, first date, so technically dating.

25:04.085 --> 25:06.296
- Okay, we're done here.
- You just said we were dating.

25:06.296 --> 25:08.340
- So was that so bad?
- What?

25:08.340 --> 25:11.301
- Celebrating yourself.
- No. Yeah, it was good.

25:11.301 --> 25:13.261
- Are you sure about that?
- Yeah, definitely.

25:13.261 --> 25:15.138
I'm just not used to this sort of thing.

25:15.138 --> 25:17.307
Amelia, let's go.
I have to give my cat his medicine.

25:17.307 --> 25:19.100
Okay. Um, do you need a ride?

25:19.100 --> 25:20.602
- No. My dad's coming.
- Come on.

25:20.602 --> 25:22.562
He just doesn't drive faster
than 12 miles an hour.

25:22.562 --> 25:24.731
- Happy birthday!
- Thank you guys for everything.

25:27.484 --> 25:29.945
Wei-Chen! Hey!

25:29.945 --> 25:32.113
Hey, what happened?

25:32.113 --> 25:34.449
They took him.

25:34.449 --> 25:35.951
Who? Took who?

25:38.787 --> 25:39.829
My father.

26:03.937 --> 26:07.232
No, no, I'm serious.
That's what he's saying.

26:07.232 --> 26:13.238
This is a play about the tension between
individual will and preordained destiny.

26:13.238 --> 26:16.616
But what Cassius is actually saying
to Brutus here

26:16.616 --> 26:18.285
is, "Don't be a wimp."

26:19.661 --> 26:22.539
"To find ourselves dishonorable graves.

26:22.539 --> 26:26.418
Men at some times
are masters of our fates."

26:26.418 --> 26:28.503
In other words, take action.

26:29.212 --> 26:33.842
"The fault, dear Brutus,
is not in our stars,

26:33.842 --> 26:39.014
but in ourselves, that we are underlings."

26:39.848 --> 26:44.227
He's saying
that fate is not decided up there,

26:44.227 --> 26:45.979
but down here.

26:46.563 --> 26:51.026
So, be brave, be bold, act.

26:52.444 --> 26:54.821
And then they kill Caesar.

26:58.992 --> 27:02.912
Uh, okay, so let's continue
this discussion tomorrow after warm-ups.

27:02.912 --> 27:04.164
Thanks, everyone.

27:10.170 --> 27:13.673
Marissa, hey. It's great to hear from you.
Did you check out the script?

27:13.673 --> 27:17.260
Not yet. I will. But I think you know
what I'm calling about.

27:17.260 --> 27:18.928
Yes, the reunion show.

27:18.928 --> 27:21.014
It's a live taping, Jamie.

27:21.014 --> 27:23.350
They need an answer by end of day.

27:23.350 --> 27:25.810
Everybody's returning except for Lacey.

27:25.810 --> 27:27.103
Nobody liked her anyway.

27:27.103 --> 27:29.856
I just... [sighs] ...I need more time
to think about it.

27:29.856 --> 27:31.524
<i>What is there to think about?</i>

27:31.524 --> 27:34.027
Well, I'm still trying to get financing
for the film,

27:34.027 --> 27:36.196
and you know I teach classes at the JC.

27:36.196 --> 27:39.949
Listen, sweetie, opportunity like this
doesn't come along every day.

27:40.450 --> 27:43.203
They're talking about
a possible full-season reboot.

27:43.870 --> 27:49.000
They need you to show up. And I just--
I would hate to see you miss this chance.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.878
- Do I have to say the line?
-<i>I knew this was gonna come up.</i>

27:52.921 --> 27:55.465
Marissa, will I have to say the line?

27:55.465 --> 27:57.217
Here's what I think.

27:57.217 --> 28:00.011
I think Freddy Wong
is an iconic character.

28:00.011 --> 28:02.389
I think you are a trailblazer

28:02.389 --> 28:05.016
who opened doors
for a generation of actors.

28:05.642 --> 28:08.436
And I think they're gonna have to
update the show no matter what.

28:08.937 --> 28:10.522
So it's a conversation we can have.

28:11.564 --> 28:14.192
You know, last month I took my car in
for an oil change.

28:14.192 --> 28:17.278
I sat there for 45 minutes,
and no one said a thing to me.

28:17.278 --> 28:19.114
Then as I was driving away,

28:19.114 --> 28:21.908
the service guy yells,
"What could go Wong?"

28:21.908 --> 28:23.410
It's been 30 years.

28:23.410 --> 28:26.663
I know. And that's not gonna change.

28:27.288 --> 28:29.040
So why not get paid for it?

28:29.040 --> 28:31.084
<i>Maybe even enough to finance a movie.</i>

28:31.084 --> 28:33.545
Marissa, please. Please read the script.

28:33.545 --> 28:34.629
I'm on it tonight.
