10:53.028 --> 10:55.070
Cat:<i> I'm not gonna lie.</i>
<i> I was nervous.</i>

10:57.032 --> 10:58.323
Tyler:
<i> Cat was grinding on me,</i>

10:58.367 --> 11:00.825
<i> and she's just</i>
<i> getting after it.</i>

11:00.869 --> 11:03.078
Really just getting dirty!

11:03.080 --> 11:06.998
I mean, she's probably
the dirtiest one out of all.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.125
Cat:
<i> It got super steamy.</i>

11:09.169 --> 11:11.920
-  <i>♪ oh, yeah  </i>
- oh, baby.

11:11.922 --> 11:14.964
( cat laughing )

11:14.966 --> 11:17.050
<i> ♪ for a voice to come </i>

11:17.094 --> 11:19.469
I'm still sweating.

11:19.513 --> 11:22.055
<i> ♪ in the night </i>

11:22.099 --> 11:25.016
- I could be your baby.
- All right.

11:25.894 --> 11:29.813
- Whoa.
- Pick who you want.

11:29.856 --> 11:31.981
Ooh!

11:31.983 --> 11:34.484
You going to bed?

11:34.486 --> 11:37.028
Oh!

11:37.072 --> 11:38.988
Come on, give it to me!

11:38.990 --> 11:43.076
( loni laughing )

11:43.078 --> 11:44.244
tyler:
<i> Good lord.</i>

11:44.287 --> 11:45.829
<i> My nana's gonna</i>
<i> be watching this,</i>

11:45.831 --> 11:46.996
and she's gonna have
a hard talk with me.

11:46.998 --> 11:49.040
But, nana, I'm sorry.
I love you.

11:49.084 --> 11:50.291
I was just having fun.

11:50.377 --> 11:52.377
So, ladies,
we all danced with tyler.

11:52.421 --> 11:54.963
- How was it?
- Whoo! It was hot.

11:54.965 --> 11:56.464
- Hot.
- It was hot.

11:56.508 --> 11:58.925
All y'all some hornies.

11:58.927 --> 12:00.760
- That's--
- ha!

12:04.182 --> 12:06.725
So here we are, y'all,
moment of truth.

12:06.768 --> 12:10.353
Time to see if tyler and cat
will stay with each other

12:10.397 --> 12:13.857
or swap out for new partners.

12:13.900 --> 12:14.983
This decision is important

12:14.985 --> 12:17.318
because this
will be your partner

12:17.362 --> 12:20.864
for the remainder
of the competition.

12:20.907 --> 12:23.074
So make it count.

12:23.076 --> 12:26.828
Tyler, are you going
to choose the leading baby

12:26.872 --> 12:28.246
or are you going to switch?

12:28.290 --> 12:32.041
All right,
this was a very tough choice.

12:32.085 --> 12:36.796
The person I had to pick
is someone I felt a fire with,

12:36.840 --> 12:40.216
felt a little bit of chemistry,
and I wanna chase that.

12:40.260 --> 12:44.137
And so to be my baby,
I pick...

12:47.267 --> 12:48.224
Anjelah.

12:52.063 --> 12:55.732
- Wow. Wow.
- I'm sorry, cat.
I'm sorry, cat.

12:57.152 --> 12:58.568
Anjelah:
<i> He know what he wanted...</i>

12:58.653 --> 13:00.987
- Exactly.
- ...And he came in and got it.

13:01.031 --> 13:03.531
Anjelah!

13:03.575 --> 13:05.033
- You have a great partner.
- Thank you.

13:05.076 --> 13:08.703
- I mean, he is amazing.
- Thanks.

13:08.747 --> 13:11.372
Howie:<i> He's taking anjelah.</i>
<i> He's taking my baby.</i>

13:11.458 --> 13:16.377
I felt crushed,
like a girlfriend getting
taken by another guy.

13:16.421 --> 13:20.131
<i> But I understand the choice</i>
<i> that he made.</i>

13:20.175 --> 13:22.217
All right, so we have
a lot at stake right now

13:22.260 --> 13:25.929
because tyler decided to swap,

13:25.972 --> 13:29.849
but we don't know if cat
made that same decision.

13:29.893 --> 13:34.020
Corbin:
<i> And I was like, "oh, no,</i>
<i> did she actually pick tyler?"</i>

13:34.064 --> 13:36.981
I hope not, because I wanted
to win my baby back.

13:37.025 --> 13:38.525
Cat: I will say
from the beginning,

13:38.610 --> 13:41.986
you all to me personify
in some way johnny.

13:41.988 --> 13:42.987
You know, I'm an athlete.

13:42.989 --> 13:44.823
<i> Cat's really driven,</i>

13:44.866 --> 13:47.116
<i> and I think we'd be</i>
<i> the best baby and johnny.</i>

13:47.160 --> 13:48.993
My dad always told me--
he said, "you know what?

13:48.995 --> 13:50.870
You dance with the one
who brought you."

13:50.914 --> 13:52.956
so that's what I'm gonna do.

13:52.958 --> 13:54.415
Corbin.

13:54.501 --> 13:58.253
- Aw.
- Wow. Wow.

13:58.255 --> 14:01.923
- I am so happy! So happy
I have my baby back.
- Yes.

14:01.967 --> 14:04.342
Corbin:<i> You are not</i>
<i> gonna regret this because</i>
<i> we are gonna go to the end.</i>

14:04.386 --> 14:06.636
- Cat:<i> I know. </i>
- Corbin:<i> Take it all</i>
<i> the way to the end.</i>

14:06.680 --> 14:11.057
- You ready, baby?
- Oh, I'm ready.
Are you ready?

14:11.101 --> 14:13.309
Twitch:
<i> So with two partnerships set,</i>

14:13.311 --> 14:15.687
I have to partner up
the remaining contestants.

14:15.730 --> 14:17.689
Howie, you're looking
a little lonely over there.

14:17.732 --> 14:19.065
Why don't you come over here
and join everybody?

14:19.109 --> 14:21.317
- Howie!
- Aww, howie.

14:21.361 --> 14:23.987
- Come here, girl.
Can I sit on your lap?
- Yeah.

14:23.989 --> 14:27.156
Oh, that actually
works out perfectly,

14:27.200 --> 14:29.951
because that is how
I'm going to pair you.

14:29.995 --> 14:32.787
I knew it! I knew it!

14:32.831 --> 14:35.665
Now I have a backstreet boy?
Keep your eye out on us,

14:35.667 --> 14:38.042
- 'cause we gonna
surprise everybody.
- That's right.

14:38.086 --> 14:40.795
- ♪ everybody
- ow!

14:40.839 --> 14:43.590
♪ yeah, watch our bodies

14:43.633 --> 14:45.008
- ow!
- ♪ yeah

14:45.043 --> 14:47.260
so, antonio, brie,

14:47.304 --> 14:49.971
that means you two
are staying together.

14:50.015 --> 14:51.723
Given the nature
of this competition,

14:51.766 --> 14:53.641
it's all about growth, right?

14:53.685 --> 14:56.019
So you started
the competition together,

14:56.062 --> 14:58.605
- and I'd love for y'all
to continue that.
- Yeah.

14:58.607 --> 15:01.024
- This is gonna be baby
and johnny to the end.
- Yes.

15:01.067 --> 15:04.235
- Yes, yes, yes, yes.
- Let's go.

15:04.279 --> 15:05.820
And remember, one couple
will be eliminated

15:05.822 --> 15:10.408
after this next performance,
so the stakes are high.

15:10.452 --> 15:12.327
- All right.
- All right, let's do it.
I'm ready.

15:12.370 --> 15:14.787
You have work to do.
Go ahead and get to rehearsal.

15:14.831 --> 15:15.788
- Let's do it.
- You ready? Let's go.

15:16.082 --> 15:18.458
- I'm ready. Let's go.
- All right, let's go.

15:19.836 --> 15:20.877
- Twitch:<i> Coming up... </i>
- Left, right.

15:20.921 --> 15:22.754
Oh, wait, no.

15:22.797 --> 15:24.881
<i> As the competition ramps up...</i>

15:24.925 --> 15:27.050
They just messed up a lot.

15:27.093 --> 15:29.385
<i> Heightened emotions...</i>

15:29.387 --> 15:32.764
No matter
what you're going through,
take a challenge.

15:33.850 --> 15:35.892
<i> Unbelievable routines...</i>

15:35.936 --> 15:37.769
Oh!

15:37.854 --> 15:40.396
<i> ...And one</i>
<i> devastating departure.</i>

15:40.440 --> 15:41.981
Oh!

15:48.031 --> 15:50.990
Mambo! Yeah, come on!

15:52.702 --> 15:55.495
Twitch:
<i> The outfits were all part of</i>
<i> baby's transformation.</i>

15:58.625 --> 16:01.250
<i> And it's just as crucial</i>
<i> for our babys</i>

16:01.294 --> 16:04.087
<i> to be wearing the right outfit</i>
<i> for their performance.</i>

16:04.130 --> 16:06.881
I would say one of my favorites
is that bodysuit

16:06.925 --> 16:08.800
<i> with the denim shorts.</i>

16:08.843 --> 16:10.343
<i> - Ooh.</i>
<i> - Oh, I love that.</i>

16:10.387 --> 16:14.180
-<i> Love that. </i>
- I really hope
the pink skirt is there.

16:14.224 --> 16:15.974
<i> - Yes.</i>
<i> - That was so great.</i>

16:16.017 --> 16:18.017
I love the one where
it was that white--

16:18.019 --> 16:19.394
<i> oh, my gosh.</i>
<i> The "lover boy" scene.</i>

16:19.688 --> 16:22.105
<i> - Yes, where she's crawling</i>
<i> on the floor.</i>
<i> - Stalking.</i>

16:22.107 --> 16:24.065
I'll go first.
All right, here we go.

16:24.067 --> 16:25.149
I'm so excited for you.

16:25.193 --> 16:29.696
Baby's clothes,
they were skimpy.

16:29.739 --> 16:31.990
<i> In the beginning,</i>
<i> she didn't show a lot of skin,</i>

16:32.033 --> 16:34.909
<i> but then she showed</i>
<i> a lot of skin,</i>

16:34.953 --> 16:39.956
and I am not in a place
right now where I feel like
I can do that.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.250
My little boy just turned one,

16:42.252 --> 16:45.253
and I have so many
stretch marks on my stomach.

16:45.296 --> 16:47.130
- Yeah, yeah.
- So I'm very insecure.

16:48.591 --> 16:51.426
All right, here we go.

16:52.846 --> 16:57.098
- Whoa!
- Oh, my gosh!

16:57.934 --> 17:00.351
Are you kidding me?

17:00.395 --> 17:04.147
- 54, who?
- Right? You stop.

17:04.190 --> 17:05.440
Cat:
<i> The outfit I picked out,</i>

17:05.775 --> 17:07.817
it surprised me
that I picked that out,
because I was like,

17:07.861 --> 17:11.029
"wow, okay.
You have definitely
come out of your shell."

17:12.824 --> 17:15.658
- loni: How do you feel?
- It feels good to know
I have six kids.

17:15.660 --> 17:19.996
54 years old. I feel like
I'm coming out again.

17:20.623 --> 17:21.831
Again!

17:21.875 --> 17:23.249
- Who's going next? Come on.
- I'll go next.

17:23.668 --> 17:28.880
Brie:
<i> What this movie means to me</i>
<i> is really seeing a young girl</i>

17:28.882 --> 17:32.050
become this strong,
sexy woman.

17:32.927 --> 17:35.261
<i> When you own your sexuality,</i>

17:35.263 --> 17:37.096
that's really empowering.

17:37.974 --> 17:39.849
- Oh!
- Ooh!

17:39.851 --> 17:41.225
- Wow.
- Yeah!

17:41.227 --> 17:44.937
- Yes!
- Whoo! Yeah!

17:44.981 --> 17:48.649
<i> There's nothing like bringing</i>
<i> out your feminine energy</i>
<i> and sexuality.</i>

17:48.693 --> 17:51.277
So kind of like baby,
she just slowly found it,

17:51.362 --> 17:53.029
<i> and I feel like</i>
<i> I'm slowly finding it.</i>

17:53.064 --> 17:54.322
You look so good.

17:54.365 --> 17:58.159
And it feels really damn good.

17:59.829 --> 18:01.621
- Oh.
- Oh, adorable!

18:01.664 --> 18:05.583
- Oh, it's so cute!
I love that!
- Whoo!

18:05.627 --> 18:09.754
Sexy is outside
of my wheelhouse.
I'm very tomboy.

18:12.133 --> 18:16.052
<i> This feels very exposed</i>
<i> and vulnerable.</i>

18:16.096 --> 18:19.555
It's this nuance of balancing,

18:19.599 --> 18:22.975
you know,
who I am as a woman in my faith

18:23.019 --> 18:26.270
and knowing that I can be sexy

18:26.314 --> 18:29.232
and beautiful
and god still loves me.

18:29.234 --> 18:34.070
You do look really good.
Amazing.

18:34.072 --> 18:37.323
If I was dancing with howie,
I would love this.

18:37.367 --> 18:39.742
But now that
I'm dancing with tyler,

18:39.786 --> 18:44.247
I feel like I need to be wearing
one of these, you know?

18:44.249 --> 18:45.581
- I get it. I get it.
- I don't know.

18:48.336 --> 18:52.004
- All right, loni, we're ready.
- We're ready. We're waiting.

18:52.048 --> 18:54.090
I've always been a big girl,

18:54.134 --> 18:56.884
<i> but I always wanted</i>
<i> to wear baby's clothes.</i>

18:56.928 --> 19:00.429
I had been waiting
all my life for this!

19:00.473 --> 19:02.890
- Whoo!
- Loni!

19:02.934 --> 19:05.393
Oh, my god.
That looks gorgeous.

19:05.395 --> 19:06.352
Ow!

19:06.396 --> 19:08.312
Thank you,
and I feel comfortable.

19:08.398 --> 19:11.357
I always tell women,
be comfortable with who you are.

19:11.401 --> 19:12.900
Yeah.

19:12.944 --> 19:14.152
- That's why I love this movie.
- Yeah.

19:14.195 --> 19:16.279
- Because it's for every woman.
- That's right.

19:16.322 --> 19:19.907
Aw. Come on, girls.
Let's hug it out.

19:19.909 --> 19:20.783
- Mm-hmm.
- Come on. You're right.

19:21.035 --> 19:24.370
- It is for everybody.
- Right. It is.

19:24.414 --> 19:28.416
For every woman, no matter
which age, size, race...

19:28.459 --> 19:30.751
Loni: When they asked me
to join this challenge,

19:30.795 --> 19:32.253
I was like,
well, I don't dance.

19:32.297 --> 19:34.297
I mean, I don't have
a dancer's body.

19:34.299 --> 19:37.216
And, you know,
I thought about it,

19:37.218 --> 19:40.887
and I wanna show women out there
that no matter who you are,

19:40.889 --> 19:44.891
no matter
what you're going through,
take a challenge.

19:44.934 --> 19:46.767
And that's what we're doing.

19:46.811 --> 19:48.436
For me,
it's all of your support,

19:48.479 --> 19:50.354
'cause sometimes
women tear each other down.

19:50.398 --> 19:54.859
- It's so true.
- You guys have made me feel
so comfortable and so good,

19:54.861 --> 19:56.110
this little circle here.

19:56.154 --> 19:58.196
This bond here
is so much more important.

19:58.239 --> 20:00.573
- Oh, definitely.
- We are sisters.

20:00.617 --> 20:02.575
Definitely sisters.

20:13.963 --> 20:17.506
- Antonio.
- Wow.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.217
I got my baby outfit on.

20:19.260 --> 20:22.053
You look like baby.
That looks so good.

20:22.096 --> 20:23.221
How are you?

20:23.264 --> 20:25.514
- Oh, hey. You look good.
- Thank you.

20:25.516 --> 20:27.767
<i> After trying on</i>
<i> baby's clothes,</i>

20:27.769 --> 20:31.229
I came in with a different
attitude to rehearsals.

20:32.065 --> 20:33.940
Five, six...

20:33.942 --> 20:36.934
<i> ♪ with these </i>

20:36.945 --> 20:40.363
I'm finally starting
to feel sexy.

20:40.406 --> 20:42.365
<i> ♪ one look at you</i>
<i> and I can't disguise ♪</i>

20:42.408 --> 20:44.867
and "hungry eyes"
just puts you in the mood.

20:44.911 --> 20:47.453
<i> ♪ hungry eyes </i>

20:50.208 --> 20:52.208
<i> but I know we have</i>
<i> a lot of work to do.</i>

20:54.212 --> 20:56.754
Our rehearsal was just okay.
We did some things well.

20:58.299 --> 20:59.548
And we did some things
not so well.

20:59.550 --> 21:01.217
Oh, you gotta--

21:01.261 --> 21:02.885
I mean, we're still
building chemistry.

21:02.929 --> 21:04.428
We're still building continuity.

21:06.933 --> 21:09.308
We definitely have
a lot of room to improve.

21:12.021 --> 21:14.230
Whoo! Hi, twitch!

21:14.274 --> 21:18.192
So, y'all, tonight is
the first night of elimination.

21:18.236 --> 21:20.653

they think that we're gonna be,
like, funny and laughing.

22:49.786 --> 22:52.328
- Right.
- But we're gonna try to
create something sexual,

22:52.372 --> 22:54.288
something dirty,
'cause it's still a competition.

22:54.290 --> 22:56.916

exactly as we planned it,

32:17.937 --> 32:21.313
<i> but it's way too early</i>
<i> to go home.</i>

32:21.357 --> 32:24.483
Twitch:<i> Coming up,</i>
<i> our final performances...</i>

32:24.526 --> 32:26.068
Oh!

32:26.070 --> 32:29.029
<i> ...And a tough decision</i>
<i> has to be made.</i>

32:29.073 --> 32:33.283
I didn't want that to happen.
And it did.

32:42.169 --> 32:43.919
Listen, you just gotta
do something for me.

32:43.963 --> 32:45.587
I don't just gotta do anything.

32:45.631 --> 32:47.589
Just tell mommy and daddy
I've got a terrible headache

32:47.633 --> 32:50.258
and I'm in bed,
and check on me once, okay?

32:50.302 --> 32:52.052
Bye.

32:56.850 --> 32:58.308
Next up...

33:00.145 --> 33:02.354
Brie and antonio.

33:02.398 --> 33:04.231
Ow!

33:04.233 --> 33:07.317
We have to make it
about passion and connection,

33:07.361 --> 33:09.444
because that's what
the song is about.

33:09.530 --> 33:11.613
Brie:
<i> I'm ready to get sexy.</i>

33:11.657 --> 33:15.826
I'm just gonna do it.
I'm going full on.

33:15.828 --> 33:17.327

- That was hot!
- Oh, my gosh.

34:23.228 --> 34:24.978
Oh, shoot.
I was not expecting that.

34:24.980 --> 34:27.522
- Oh, my god.
-<i> They were connected</i>

34:27.524 --> 34:29.566
<i> like they've never</i>
<i> been connected before.</i>

34:29.610 --> 34:32.903
And I was like, "oh, my god.
That was fantastic."

34:32.946 --> 34:34.654
go, brie!

34:34.656 --> 34:39.868
Okay, who is this couple
compared to who we saw
the first challenge?

34:39.912 --> 34:41.244
- Brie...
- Brie: I know.

34:41.246 --> 34:43.747
...Your growth
is tremendous, tremendous.

34:43.749 --> 34:45.624
- Man, that was awesome though.
- Thank you.

34:45.626 --> 34:49.336
- Jane?
- Oh, that was just,
uh, very hot.

34:50.339 --> 34:52.714
I could see
you really wanted her.

34:52.758 --> 34:56.051
I don't know
if that's gonna cause problems
in anybody's life.

34:56.095 --> 34:59.638
- It might.
- Could be mine.

34:59.681 --> 35:04.017
Jane: The hunger and sex appeal
was very present.

35:04.061 --> 35:05.977
Thank you.

35:06.021 --> 35:08.522
Antonio and I
finally found our chemistry.

35:08.607 --> 35:11.149
I'm really proud of us.

35:11.193 --> 35:13.944
All right,
our last couple of the night,

35:13.987 --> 35:17.614
anjelah and tyler, come on.

35:17.658 --> 35:18.990
Come on.

35:19.034 --> 35:21.368
After our second rehearsal,
we were so confident.

35:21.411 --> 35:24.412
<i> We felt good, and</i>
<i> it was just time to connect</i>
<i> and put on a show.</i>

35:25.999 --> 35:30.085
Anjelah:<i> I am so ready</i>
<i> for this performance.</i>

35:30.129 --> 35:32.254
<i> I don't want to let him down.</i>

35:39.388 --> 35:43.682

36:29.938 --> 36:31.980
Golden!

36:32.024 --> 36:34.065
Ha-ha! Let's go!

36:36.445 --> 36:38.028
Good job!

36:38.113 --> 36:42.365
Anjelah:
<i> I was really disappointed</i>
<i> after our performance.</i>

36:42.367 --> 36:45.285
I felt like I was playing
catch-up in the routine

36:45.329 --> 36:48.330
<i> and my mind went blank.</i>

36:50.167 --> 36:51.625
How are you feeling?

36:51.668 --> 36:55.337
Oh, well, I was just like,
"what is going on?",

36:55.339 --> 36:59.007
<i> like in my brain</i>
<i> with all my missteps,</i>

36:59.009 --> 37:01.801
<i> but tyler</i>
<i> is such a good leader,</i>

37:01.845 --> 37:04.012
<i> and he was so in the moment.</i>

37:04.056 --> 37:05.305
<i> And literally</i>
<i> when my brain went,</i>

37:05.349 --> 37:06.890
<i> "I don't even know</i>
<i> what's next,"</i>

37:06.934 --> 37:08.308
<i> he was guiding me.</i>

37:08.352 --> 37:09.893
But what I loved is
you didn't get down about it.

37:09.937 --> 37:10.894
You just kept going,
you know what I mean?

37:11.188 --> 37:12.729
- Twitch: Yeah, exactly.
- And you couldn't tell.

37:12.731 --> 37:14.022
You just kept rolling with it
and it was beautiful.

37:14.066 --> 37:15.190
- So you did amazing.
- Thank you.

37:15.234 --> 37:16.566
We wouldn't have even noticed.

37:16.610 --> 37:19.069
- Yeah, amazing.
- Exactly.

37:19.112 --> 37:22.239
- And it was dirty as anything.
- Absolutely.

37:22.241 --> 37:24.449
I mean, dirty, dirty.

37:27.329 --> 37:30.247
All right, y'all,
after seeing the performances,

37:30.249 --> 37:32.290
jane and I have
a lot to talk about.

37:32.334 --> 37:35.293
So if you could just excuse us
for a little while.

37:35.337 --> 37:38.296
Corbin:<i> Somebody was</i>
<i> gonna be going home.</i>

37:38.340 --> 37:41.466
The reality kinda struck.

37:43.095 --> 37:47.305
- ( whimpers )
- anjelah, are you okay?

37:48.225 --> 37:52.560
I just, um, messed up a lot.

37:53.563 --> 37:54.854
I've done that before

37:54.898 --> 37:58.024
when it's time to rise
to the occasion,

37:58.068 --> 38:01.027
like, self-sabotage.

38:02.239 --> 38:06.408
I didn't want that to happen.
And it did.

38:22.134 --> 38:24.342
Twitch:
<i> Our four couples have danced.</i>

38:24.386 --> 38:27.971
<i> Now one couple must go home.</i>

38:29.474 --> 38:31.349
- Whoo.
- I know.

38:31.393 --> 38:35.186
All right, y'all.
Welcome back. Welcome back.

38:35.230 --> 38:37.814
Up to this point,
it's all been love.

38:37.858 --> 38:41.151
It's all been excitement.
It's been joy.

38:41.194 --> 38:45.030
But now we've reached
our first elimination.

38:46.867 --> 38:48.283
Loni:
<i> I'm originally from detroit,</i>

38:48.327 --> 38:51.494
and I was
little miss detroit 1972,

38:51.538 --> 38:54.122
so I'm used to winning.

38:54.166 --> 38:56.333
I'm confident, you know,
but there's confidence

38:56.376 --> 38:59.118
and there's
a false sense of bravado.

38:59.129 --> 39:00.754
<i> We made some mistakes.</i>

39:00.797 --> 39:03.965
<i> I just hope we've done enough</i>
<i> to make it to the next dance.</i>

39:05.052 --> 39:06.217
Cat:
<i> Even though I'm an iron chef,</i>

39:06.261 --> 39:08.636
in every competition
there are nerves

39:08.638 --> 39:11.431
when there's an elimination.
I mean, always.

39:13.226 --> 39:17.395
So, jane, who are
the best baby and johnny?

39:17.397 --> 39:20.023
This is ridiculously difficult.

39:26.156 --> 39:30.075
To me, the winners
are cat and corbin.

39:30.118 --> 39:32.702
- Oh, my god.
- Yeah!

39:34.247 --> 39:35.789
- Love you two.
Love you two.
- Thank you.

39:35.874 --> 39:38.208
- I love you, guys.
- Thank you so much.

39:38.251 --> 39:40.251
- Thank you, guys.
- Thank you.

39:40.253 --> 39:43.004
- I'm proud of you.
- Thank you.

39:45.258 --> 39:47.967
Okay, honestly this
was such a tough decision

39:47.969 --> 39:50.220
that jane didn't even
want to say it,

39:50.263 --> 39:53.181
so I'm gonna say it for her.
This was very close.

39:55.310 --> 39:58.144
I was so disappointed
in my performance

39:58.230 --> 40:01.022
because this was
my favorite routine so far.

40:01.024 --> 40:04.984
<i> I felt like this could be</i>
<i> the end for us.</i>

40:05.028 --> 40:09.406
I was kinda worried
because you just never know
how people view you.

40:11.201 --> 40:18.081
The first couple to be
eliminated is...

40:20.001 --> 40:21.209
Howie and loni.

40:21.253 --> 40:23.211
Aww.

40:23.255 --> 40:26.256
- Well, we had a good time,
so thank you so much.
- Yes, we did. We sure did.

40:26.258 --> 40:27.632
- Twitch: Absolutely.
- We had a really good time.

40:27.676 --> 40:30.552
It's been an amazing journey
with all of you guys.

40:30.595 --> 40:34.347
Yeah, man, definitely.
Definitely, definitely.

40:34.391 --> 40:36.015
I would not change a thing.

40:36.059 --> 40:38.893
I had a great experience

40:38.937 --> 40:42.355
and I'm so happy
to be a part of it.

40:43.400 --> 40:45.483
I really am.

40:49.865 --> 40:52.282
Aw, same to you guys.
It's been fun.

40:52.325 --> 40:54.993
<i> I don't want</i>
<i> to get teary-eyed here,</i>

40:54.995 --> 40:57.370
but I'm the real baby here.

40:59.124 --> 41:01.666
But nobody puts baby
in the corner,

41:01.710 --> 41:05.044
and that's what I feel like
I accomplished out of all this

41:05.046 --> 41:07.839
was that I came out of my corner

41:07.883 --> 41:12.385
and hopefully
showed another side
of who I am to the world.

41:17.350 --> 41:22.187
All right, well, your stay
at kellerman's has now ended,

41:22.230 --> 41:25.106
but we love you
and we thank you.

41:25.108 --> 41:27.817
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you very much.

41:27.861 --> 41:31.529
And thank you to
our guest judge jane brucker.
Thank you very much.

41:31.573 --> 41:34.032
- Yes.
- Yes.

41:37.287 --> 41:40.330
- Please keep dancing. Please.
- Absolutely.

41:40.332 --> 41:42.248
I ask that y'all exit with jane.

41:42.292 --> 41:44.167
- Come on, jane. Let's go.
- Thank you.

41:44.211 --> 41:46.002
- Come on, howie.
- Love you guys.

41:46.046 --> 41:47.212
- Bye, howie.
- Bye, howie. Bye, loni.

41:47.255 --> 41:48.046
Howie: Come on, baby.
Let's go.

41:48.256 --> 41:50.256
- Loni: All right.
- Let's go home.

41:50.300 --> 41:53.009
Loni:<i> I came here</i>
<i> to celebrate this movie,</i>

41:53.053 --> 41:55.053
and I learned that
I really love to dance.

41:55.096 --> 41:57.138
And it could be dirty,
it could be sweet.

41:57.182 --> 41:59.557
I like dirty though.

42:04.439 --> 42:06.356
Twitch:<i> Next week on</i>
<i> "the real dirty dancing,"</i>

42:06.399 --> 42:10.276
<i> the dancing gets dirtier...</i>

42:10.320 --> 42:11.194
Whoo!

42:11.238 --> 42:13.154
<i> Pressure builds...</i>

42:13.198 --> 42:15.323
Oh, my god.
I'm so sorry.

42:15.367 --> 42:18.535
<i> ...And confidence crumbles.</i>

42:18.578 --> 42:20.995
We have to follow that?

42:22.207 --> 42:24.207
I'm tired of coming in
second place on tv.

42:24.251 --> 42:26.209
<i> One more couple must go home.</i>

42:26.253 --> 42:28.035
I don't like to lose.

42:28.037 --> 42:29.420
We gonna kill this competition.

42:29.422 --> 42:32.006
- Oh!
- Yes!
