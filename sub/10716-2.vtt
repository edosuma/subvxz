WEBVTT

00:25.626 --> 00:27.661
Whoa, you look
like an unmade bed.

00:27.661 --> 00:31.332
Yeah, huh? Up all night
chasing video.

00:31.332 --> 00:33.501
One of those for me?

00:33.501 --> 00:35.303
You want to wrestle
J. Edgar for it?

00:35.303 --> 00:37.471
No, nuh-uh. No, sir.

00:37.471 --> 00:39.407
So your video, did you
catch anything?

00:39.407 --> 00:42.143
License plates going
both ways on Cahuenga

00:42.143 --> 00:43.411
Sunday morning at 4 a.m.

00:43.411 --> 00:44.745
- How many?
- 22.

00:44.745 --> 00:46.013
Ran them through DMV.

00:46.013 --> 00:47.848
- Any hits?
- One came back cold.

00:47.848 --> 00:49.383
No record on file.

00:49.383 --> 00:51.119
You run them through
Alpers yet?

00:51.119 --> 00:53.287
That's what we
want to show you.

00:54.588 --> 00:55.623
Ah.

00:55.623 --> 00:57.225
Thanks. Take a look.

00:57.225 --> 00:59.927
Past six months,
captured a few places--

00:59.927 --> 01:02.230
near the airport
a couple of times.

01:02.230 --> 01:04.498
Downtown a few more.

01:04.498 --> 01:06.634
There. Spring Street.
How many hits?

01:06.634 --> 01:08.236
Nine, ten. Wait.

01:08.236 --> 01:09.670
Let me Google Earth this.

01:15.676 --> 01:17.945
That is a big-ass
parking lot.

01:17.945 --> 01:19.847
It's a fine place
to stash a car.

01:19.847 --> 01:20.848
Happy hunting.

01:27.255 --> 01:29.157
A lot of Tahoes.

01:29.157 --> 01:31.892
Not one of them
without plates.

01:31.892 --> 01:34.595
Lot of SUVs
with tinted windows.

01:34.595 --> 01:36.029
Feds.

01:44.805 --> 01:46.540
Definitely Feds.

03:02.483 --> 03:04.017
Can I help you?

03:04.017 --> 03:07.621
LAPD. We need to speak
to the agent in charge.

03:07.621 --> 03:09.923
May I see some ID, please?

03:15.729 --> 03:18.165
May I ask what this is in
reference to, detectives?

03:18.165 --> 03:22.836
It's in reference to
the murder of Anthony Allen
last Saturday night.

03:30.143 --> 03:31.745
This way.

03:33.046 --> 03:34.715
Must be nice to have
a real budget.

03:34.715 --> 03:36.417
Right? How the other
half lives.

03:40.621 --> 03:41.622
Rico.

03:43.090 --> 03:44.792
I think
it's something else.

03:48.796 --> 03:49.797
Gentlemen.

03:52.566 --> 03:55.403
Gentlemen, J. Griffin,
agent in charge.

03:55.403 --> 03:56.704
In charge of what, exactly?

03:56.704 --> 03:58.171
This task force.

03:58.171 --> 03:59.907
Task force for what,
exactly?

04:01.041 --> 04:02.443
What can I do for you,
detective?

04:02.443 --> 04:03.711
A man named Anthony Allen

04:03.711 --> 04:05.513
was murdered over the weekend.

04:05.513 --> 04:07.548
His body was
discovered yesterday

04:07.548 --> 04:09.483
in the trunk of his car
up off Mulholland.

04:09.483 --> 04:10.918
Yeah, I read about it.

04:10.918 --> 04:13.153
Coroner puts time of death
Saturday night.

04:13.153 --> 04:15.856
Early Sunday morning,
two guys broke into his office

04:15.856 --> 04:18.191
and removed a number
of surveillance devices.

04:18.191 --> 04:19.327
- So?
- So,

04:19.327 --> 04:20.694
next time
you send your guys in

04:20.694 --> 04:23.397
to take a hidden camera
out of a target's office,

04:23.397 --> 04:24.732
you might want to find out

04:24.732 --> 04:26.767
if the target has a hidden
camera of his own.

04:28.802 --> 04:29.837
So?

04:29.837 --> 04:31.004
So we have video

04:31.004 --> 04:33.140
of one of your vehicles
leaving the scene.

04:33.140 --> 04:35.242
How do you think
we found you?

04:35.242 --> 04:36.477
We have warrants--

04:36.477 --> 04:37.845
not cameras,
audio surveillance.

04:37.845 --> 04:40.648
Legal wire, hooray.
We want the tapes--

04:40.648 --> 04:44.017
from his office, from his car
his phones, his house,

04:44.017 --> 04:46.019
wherever you're up on him--
and why.

04:46.019 --> 04:47.355
That's confidential.

04:47.355 --> 04:49.056
You got to have
a need to know

04:49.056 --> 04:50.257
and a right to know,

04:50.257 --> 04:52.893
and you don't have
either.

04:52.893 --> 04:54.962
This is a homicide
investigation.

04:54.962 --> 04:56.764
We have both.

04:57.865 --> 05:00.200
Mr. Allen was
a peripheral figure

05:00.200 --> 05:01.802
in an ongoing operation

05:01.802 --> 05:03.404
that's a matter
of national security.

05:03.404 --> 05:04.605
You talking about terrorism?

05:04.605 --> 05:06.474
And we are satisfied

05:06.474 --> 05:08.241
that his murder
was unrelated

05:08.241 --> 05:09.577
to the larger inquiry.

05:09.577 --> 05:10.944
I'd like to know
how you know that.

05:10.944 --> 05:12.380
Why you'd
go to the trouble
of bugging him

05:12.380 --> 05:13.647
if he was so damn
peripheral.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.048
We're not having
this conversation.

05:15.048 --> 05:16.650
Oh, yeah, we are.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.018
Somehow you people knew
about this murder,

05:18.018 --> 05:19.252
and you sat on it.

05:19.252 --> 05:20.588
We made the appropriate
phone calls.

05:20.588 --> 05:22.255
It's not our fault
it took you two days

05:22.255 --> 05:23.591
to follow up on it.

05:23.591 --> 05:25.258
You have a bug in his car?
Is that how you knew?

05:25.258 --> 05:26.727
Got his fucking murder
on tape?

05:32.600 --> 05:35.436
It's been almost
15 years since 9/11.

05:35.436 --> 05:37.270
Now, we're working
our asses off

05:37.270 --> 05:38.906
to make sure the next 9/11

05:38.906 --> 05:40.708
doesn't happen
for another 15 years

05:40.708 --> 05:44.111
So we're not
about to compromise
our entire operation

05:44.111 --> 05:46.980
to help you solve a murder
that doesn't matter.

05:46.980 --> 05:48.148
It does to us.

05:48.148 --> 05:49.817
We need to know what you know
about Anthony Allen.

05:49.817 --> 05:51.452
You took evidence
from his office.

05:51.452 --> 05:53.186
You are like a dog
with a bone.

05:53.186 --> 05:54.655
Oh, you have no idea.

05:56.457 --> 05:58.826
We don't have
his murder on tape.

05:58.826 --> 06:00.861
We will review the material,

06:00.861 --> 06:03.664
and if we find anything
that's germane to your case,

06:03.664 --> 06:04.865
we'll turn it over.

06:04.865 --> 06:06.667
We need
to listen to the tapes.

06:06.667 --> 06:08.769
We'll determine what
matters and what doesn't.

06:10.571 --> 06:12.039
I think we're done here,
gentlemen.

06:18.512 --> 06:21.815
We're not done here,
not by a long shot.

06:27.455 --> 06:29.990
**

06:48.976 --> 06:51.945
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

06:51.945 --> 06:54.214
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

06:54.214 --> 06:56.917
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

06:56.917 --> 06:59.953
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

06:59.953 --> 07:02.322
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

07:02.322 --> 07:05.225
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

07:05.225 --> 07:07.828
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

07:07.828 --> 07:09.497
* I can't let go *

07:21.975 --> 07:23.811
* I feel *

07:37.290 --> 07:39.793
- Ah, Jesus, man.
- What?

07:39.793 --> 07:41.394
I'm gonna have to smell
that shit all day.

07:41.394 --> 07:42.796
Well, the ladies
seem to love it.

07:42.796 --> 07:44.131
Oh, the ladies do?

07:44.131 --> 07:46.366
The bad guys are going
to smell you coming.

07:46.366 --> 07:47.535
That shit's intense.

07:48.769 --> 07:50.403
- Listen to him.
- Ah, fuck y'all.

07:50.403 --> 07:51.772
- My God.
- Thank you.

07:51.772 --> 07:53.574
I should have gone
to law school.

08:05.786 --> 08:08.589
Tell him that you're
picking up for Eddie A.

08:09.557 --> 08:12.159
Hey, uh,
maybe you should do it.

08:13.694 --> 08:16.129
I'm just saying, man.
He knows you.

08:20.934 --> 08:21.969
All right.

08:33.480 --> 08:35.583
Picking up for Eddie A.

08:53.066 --> 08:54.935
That will be $2.00.

09:20.127 --> 09:21.394
You owe me 2 bucks.

09:21.394 --> 09:23.163
Yeah. Remind me.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.970
$245,000 dollars
in a secret trap,

09:29.970 --> 09:32.239
federal wire tap on his phone,

09:32.239 --> 09:33.841
a terrorism task force,

09:33.841 --> 09:35.508
and a murder
that "doesn't matter."

09:35.508 --> 09:37.210
I want to know
what's on those tapes.

09:37.210 --> 09:38.411
Let me call Irving.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.714
Maybe he can get them
to release what's relevant.

09:40.714 --> 09:42.449
Griffin didn't
mention the cash,

09:42.449 --> 09:43.751
and I didn't
bring it up.

09:43.751 --> 09:45.753
Maybe they missed it.

09:45.753 --> 09:47.120
Think they searched
the car?

09:47.120 --> 09:48.722
Don't you?
They knew where it was.

09:48.722 --> 09:51.424
I think they found
the body and backed away.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.526
Tell Irving
about the cash.

09:53.526 --> 09:55.362
Maybe he can
use it to deal.

09:56.764 --> 09:58.198
What about the widow?

09:58.198 --> 09:59.366
Edgar's up there now

09:59.366 --> 10:01.268
looking at the footage,
checking her alibi.

10:01.268 --> 10:03.236
Ran her background.
She's got priors.

10:03.236 --> 10:04.437
Interesting.

10:04.437 --> 10:05.706
Two busts
for solicitation,

10:05.706 --> 10:07.374
back when she was
Jessica Gilroy

10:07.374 --> 10:08.575
before she married
Tony Allen.

10:08.575 --> 10:10.610
Hooker meets pornographer.

10:10.610 --> 10:11.712
Match.com.

10:11.712 --> 10:13.313
Don't scoff.

10:13.313 --> 10:15.282
I hear it's pretty much how
you meet people these days.

10:15.282 --> 10:18.151
How's that better
than picking up
strangers in a bar?

10:18.151 --> 10:20.788
Oh, God. Look at the two
of us. We're pathetic.

10:20.788 --> 10:22.289
That we are.
Got to book.

10:22.289 --> 10:23.924
I'm going
to meet Edgar at SID.

10:23.924 --> 10:25.425
You up for a drink
tonight?

10:25.425 --> 10:27.861
Oh, yeah, maybe.
Let me call you.

10:28.862 --> 10:30.430
Fan mail
from some flounder?

10:30.430 --> 10:32.065
It's ugly, isn't it?

10:33.466 --> 10:36.970
On the plus side, if I
don't water it, who cares?

10:54.888 --> 10:58.258
Before we get to the prints,
I wanted to show you this.

10:58.258 --> 10:59.392
Glitter.

10:59.392 --> 11:00.794
In both cuffs.

11:01.829 --> 11:03.463
What about the prints?

11:03.463 --> 11:04.965
Pretty good.

11:05.833 --> 11:07.200
Jacket's treated

11:07.200 --> 11:09.069
so the leather didn't
absorb the oils.

11:09.069 --> 11:10.871
Can you grab the lights,
please, Wendell?

11:16.043 --> 11:17.778
Palm print
on the right shoulder.

11:17.778 --> 11:19.312
Small hand.
Could be a woman.

11:19.312 --> 11:21.815
Thumbprints on each lapel
from somebody else,

11:21.815 --> 11:22.950
probably a man.

11:22.950 --> 11:25.152
Thumbs are smudged.
So is the palm.

11:25.152 --> 11:27.420
We might be able to raise
it up with some glue.

11:27.420 --> 11:29.189
The real score--

11:30.557 --> 11:31.892
full set of fingerprints

11:31.892 --> 11:34.527
on the reverse side
of each lapel.

11:34.527 --> 11:36.196
Beautiful.

11:36.196 --> 11:37.865
Lights, please.

11:39.566 --> 11:42.602
Somebody grabbed him by
the lapels with both hands.

11:42.602 --> 11:44.204
My mama used to do that.

11:44.204 --> 11:46.239
Snatched me up, shake me
till my fillings rattled.

11:46.239 --> 11:47.540
Priority rush?

11:47.540 --> 11:49.176
For you, Harry.

11:49.176 --> 11:51.344
I reviewed
the surveillance footage.

11:51.344 --> 11:52.980
Veronica Allen
didn't go anywhere

11:52.980 --> 11:54.214
Thursday to Sunday.

11:54.214 --> 11:55.783
- Visitors?
- Just us.

11:55.783 --> 11:57.785
I served a warrant
for the GPS data.

11:57.785 --> 12:00.921
Waiting for the Bentley dealer
to get back to us with that.

12:00.921 --> 12:02.089
Could take some time.

12:02.089 --> 12:03.590
Or we could
just ask the Feds.

12:03.590 --> 12:04.858
You think they'd tell us?

12:04.858 --> 12:06.193
- If we say please.
- Ah.

12:10.463 --> 12:13.266
Now, frankly, Mayor Ramos
has had his turn.

12:13.266 --> 12:15.468
We need a new approach
to our problems.

12:15.468 --> 12:17.137
We need a fresh take.
We--

12:17.137 --> 12:18.605
Now, Mr. District Attorney,

12:18.605 --> 12:20.040
speculation is rampant

12:20.040 --> 12:21.441
that you're
running for mayor.

12:21.441 --> 12:22.810
Gail, it's no secret

12:22.810 --> 12:24.111
that I've been
thinking about it,

12:24.111 --> 12:25.879
but I have not
made up my mind yet.

12:25.879 --> 12:27.380
When do you anticipate
doing that?

12:27.380 --> 12:29.449
Now, that's some pure,
deep bullshit.

12:29.449 --> 12:31.184
...I love my job.

12:32.152 --> 12:34.054
Chief, Ms. Kowski

12:34.054 --> 12:35.823
from the mayor's office
on line 1.

12:35.823 --> 12:37.524
Did she say
what it was about?

12:37.524 --> 12:38.826
No, sir.

12:40.227 --> 12:41.394
All right.

12:46.333 --> 12:47.901
Deputy Chief Irving.

12:47.901 --> 12:49.436
Chief, it's Jen Kowski.

13:01.148 --> 13:02.215
Bosch.

13:02.215 --> 13:03.750
Detective. Ah.
I thought I was going

13:03.750 --> 13:05.618
to get your voice mail again.
This is Keisha Russell

13:05.618 --> 13:07.587
- from the Times.
- How can I help you?

13:07.587 --> 13:09.189
I write the Times'
murder blog.

13:09.189 --> 13:10.657
I'm familiar with it.

13:10.657 --> 13:12.159
Then you know
we cover every murder

13:12.159 --> 13:14.527
that occurs in Los Angeles.
In fact, I just wrote

13:14.527 --> 13:15.896
about your latest case.

13:15.896 --> 13:18.531
Nothing new to comment on
at this time.

13:18.531 --> 13:21.068
Following all leads,
et cetera, et cetera.

13:21.068 --> 13:22.435
Well, that's not
why I'm calling.

13:22.435 --> 13:24.771
- Then why?
- As you probably know,

13:24.771 --> 13:26.874
We keep a running tally
of unsolved cases,

13:26.874 --> 13:28.141
so I get tips
about open cases--

13:28.141 --> 13:30.477
some legit, some crazy.

13:30.477 --> 13:31.879
I can imagine.

13:31.879 --> 13:33.613
Twice now
in the last four months,

13:33.613 --> 13:35.015
a woman's called me to say

13:35.015 --> 13:36.616
she knows details
about an unsolved murder

13:36.616 --> 13:39.352
from 40 years ago.

13:41.188 --> 13:42.089
Yes?

13:42.089 --> 13:44.892
The murder
of Marjorie Lowe.

13:47.560 --> 13:49.562
Detective Bosch?

13:49.562 --> 13:51.398
Keisha--
It's Keisha, right?

13:51.398 --> 13:53.700
- Right.
- Keisha, don't you think

13:53.700 --> 13:55.002
this woman
read the articles

13:55.002 --> 13:56.769
that came out
during my trial

13:56.769 --> 13:58.138
and just looking
for some attention.

13:58.138 --> 13:59.806
Of course that's possible.

13:59.806 --> 14:01.408
Why did she call you
and not me?

14:01.408 --> 14:03.176
She did. She said
she left you a message

14:03.176 --> 14:05.678
and you never
called her back,
so she called me.

14:05.678 --> 14:07.114
I've been on leave
for six months.

14:07.114 --> 14:09.082
I didn't get the message.
She identify herself?

14:09.082 --> 14:12.119
I only have her
first name-- Annette--

14:12.119 --> 14:14.621
and I have a phone number.

14:14.621 --> 14:17.757
The thing is, Keisha,
I've been over that murder
book a hundred times.

14:17.757 --> 14:19.392
I could recite it
to you verbatim.

14:19.392 --> 14:22.495
There's no one named Annette
in it on any page,

14:22.495 --> 14:25.065
so I'm thinking this woman,
whoever she is,

14:25.065 --> 14:27.100
doesn't know anything
I don't already know.

14:27.100 --> 14:29.036
Maybe she wasn't
in the murder book.

14:29.036 --> 14:31.271
Maybe they missed her
the first time around.

14:31.271 --> 14:33.373
That's possible, isn't it?

14:33.373 --> 14:35.375
Yeah, it's possible,
but I doubt it.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.344
Okay, well, clearly
you're not interested,

14:37.344 --> 14:38.979
so I'm sorry to bother
you, detective.

14:38.979 --> 14:42.849
Okay. Just give me
the number.

14:42.849 --> 14:46.119
206-397.

14:50.857 --> 14:52.459
Detective?

14:52.459 --> 14:54.327
Keisha Russell,
from the Times?

14:55.963 --> 14:57.397
Said some woman's
been calling her

14:57.397 --> 14:59.199
with information
about my mother's murder.

14:59.199 --> 15:00.467
Legit?

15:00.467 --> 15:03.336
I doubt it.
I'll deal with it later.

15:05.505 --> 15:07.340
- Where are you going?
- Autopsy.

15:07.340 --> 15:09.977
I'd ask you to come,
but I know you're busy.

15:09.977 --> 15:11.979
Yeah, I'm so busy.

15:18.451 --> 15:20.053
See you tomorrow.

15:20.053 --> 15:21.521
Don't forget your shirts.

15:23.556 --> 15:25.558
You got to start
dressing better, man.

15:25.558 --> 15:28.161
Look sharp, feel sharp.
You feel me?

15:33.533 --> 15:35.002
Yeah, I feel you.

16:09.036 --> 16:10.770
So the bear says to the guy,

16:10.770 --> 16:13.106
"You don't really come
up here to hunt, do you?"

16:13.106 --> 16:14.941
Okay, here's my question.

16:14.941 --> 16:18.178
Do you not remember how many
times you've told me that joke?

16:18.178 --> 16:21.281
Or you do remember,
but you think that I don't.

16:21.281 --> 16:22.949
Does it have to be
one or the other?

16:22.949 --> 16:24.484
- Uh...
- Crate, Barrel.

16:24.484 --> 16:26.053
Just the guys I'm looking for.

16:26.053 --> 16:27.620
- Hey, what's up?
- Anthony Allen.

16:27.620 --> 16:30.223
I'm working up his property
taxes, credit cards.

16:30.223 --> 16:31.824
Came across a civil filing.

16:31.824 --> 16:36.129
When he turned 21,
he changed his name from...

16:36.129 --> 16:38.431
Avakian. Arman Avakian.

16:38.431 --> 16:40.433
Armenian.
Where did he grow up,

16:40.433 --> 16:42.169
- here or the old country?
- East Hollywood.

16:42.169 --> 16:45.105
Ah. Little Armenia.
Our old stomping grounds.

16:45.105 --> 16:46.506
You guys worked
the gang unit, right?

16:46.506 --> 16:48.241
Indeed we did.
He got a record?

16:48.241 --> 16:50.777
Yeah. Convicted
of assault at 18.

16:50.777 --> 16:53.646
Bar brawl.
Some Latino gang.
Did a year in County.

16:53.646 --> 16:55.815
Banger. Armenian Pride.

16:55.815 --> 16:59.086
Mm-hmm. A.P. was just
a typical street gang
back then.

16:59.086 --> 17:01.821
- Now?
- Oh. A highly organized

17:01.821 --> 17:04.924
serious criminal enterprise
with ties to the Russians,

17:04.924 --> 17:06.859
other ex-Soviet mafias.

17:06.859 --> 17:08.495
the brotherhood.

17:08.495 --> 17:10.697
You could see why he might
want to change his name

17:10.697 --> 17:13.166
and leave his youthful
indiscretions behind.

17:13.166 --> 17:16.303
Yeah, become a legit
pornographer and all.

17:16.303 --> 17:17.970
You remember this kid?

17:17.970 --> 17:20.640
Uh, yeah, we can't remember
what we had for lunch today.

17:20.640 --> 17:24.177
There's a guy you could
talk to at Glendale PD. Um...

17:24.177 --> 17:26.279
- Uh...
- We'll put him in touch.

17:26.279 --> 17:28.014
Yeah, if we can
remember his name.

17:28.014 --> 17:30.117
Thanks.

17:30.117 --> 17:31.418
Where was I?

17:31.418 --> 17:33.720
- Uh...
- Oh. Oh.

17:33.720 --> 17:36.189
- A guy goes hunting.
- Oh, yeah.

17:53.373 --> 17:56.309
Two expended projectiles.
.22 caliber.

17:56.309 --> 17:58.978
You see the muzzle impression,
the powder burn,

17:58.978 --> 18:00.313
and the stippling pattern.

18:00.313 --> 18:02.815
Double job, close contact.

18:02.815 --> 18:03.950
Those look rough.

18:03.950 --> 18:05.485
From a ballistics
point of view,

18:05.485 --> 18:07.154
the one is worthless.

18:07.154 --> 18:09.289
mushroomed and
fragmented on impact.

18:09.289 --> 18:12.925
But the other, half
the shaft's still intact.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.294
Could be matched.

18:14.294 --> 18:16.196
One other thing.

18:17.264 --> 18:19.166
Depp bruise
on his right cheek.

18:19.166 --> 18:20.633
Ante-mortem, definitely.

18:20.633 --> 18:22.635
So not from being
shoved in the trunk.

18:22.635 --> 18:24.504
He was alive
when he sustained it.

18:24.504 --> 18:25.772
Like this?

18:28.475 --> 18:29.609
Yep.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.278
Just like that.

18:39.186 --> 18:40.853
Detective Edgar.

18:40.853 --> 18:42.189
How'd you know?

18:42.189 --> 18:43.456
The status
on the Allen computer

18:43.456 --> 18:45.024
is exactly where it was
three hours ago.

18:45.024 --> 18:47.194
We're still imaging
everything on his hard drive.

18:47.194 --> 18:48.228
Fingerprinting?

18:48.228 --> 18:49.829
It's very good.

18:49.829 --> 18:51.531
You actually paid attention
in the training class.

18:51.531 --> 18:53.666
So the thumb drive's
working out for you?

18:53.666 --> 18:55.568
Oh, just the best
thing ever.

18:55.568 --> 18:57.437
Detective,
I have a rush on this.

18:57.437 --> 18:58.938
Yeah. Thanks for that,
by the way.

18:58.938 --> 19:00.507
I wanted to be here
all night

19:00.507 --> 19:01.974
instead of going home
to my juicy

19:01.974 --> 19:03.109
and enthusiastic
girlfriend.

19:03.109 --> 19:05.212
Well, this should
speed things up.

19:05.212 --> 19:06.413
What's this?

19:06.413 --> 19:07.747
An addendum
to the search warrant.

19:07.747 --> 19:09.249
Narrows
the hard drive search

19:09.249 --> 19:10.583
to business
and banking records.

19:10.583 --> 19:12.385
Anything pertaining
to TNA Productions,

19:12.385 --> 19:14.687
anything associated
with the names

19:14.687 --> 19:18.358
Anthony Allen, Veronica Allen,
Jessica Gilroy

19:18.358 --> 19:20.026
or Arman Avakian.

19:20.026 --> 19:21.894
Well, that narrows it down.

19:21.894 --> 19:24.030
But I'll be here all night
rooting you on.

19:24.030 --> 19:25.598
Booyah.

19:25.598 --> 19:27.667
I'll call you when I find
something of relevance.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.802
Till then, find
some place else to root.

19:30.937 --> 19:32.272
Roger that.

19:33.673 --> 19:37.310
And yet you stand there
breathing down my neck.

19:40.046 --> 19:42.315
Did I mention
she's a gymnast?

19:45.318 --> 19:47.254
I'm living the dream.

19:47.254 --> 19:49.722
Oh, he insisted
that I do it.

19:49.722 --> 19:51.057
The cat's cagey.

19:51.057 --> 19:52.359
He's testing you

19:52.359 --> 19:53.826
to see how you
handle the drop.

19:53.826 --> 19:55.362
- How much?
- Almost 2K.

19:55.362 --> 19:57.430
Okay. Anything else?

19:57.430 --> 19:58.731
Yeah, there was a camera.

19:58.731 --> 20:00.967
I saw myself on the monitor.
It's on tape.

20:00.967 --> 20:02.969
So you're on tape
taking a payoff,

20:02.969 --> 20:04.771
and he isn't. He is cagey.

20:04.771 --> 20:05.805
Yeah, of course.

20:05.805 --> 20:07.540
- We should meet.
- When?

20:07.540 --> 20:09.409
I'll let you know.
Keep the faith.

20:09.409 --> 20:10.577
We're making progress.

20:10.577 --> 20:12.111
All right.
I'll sit tight.

20:12.111 --> 20:13.946
- See you soon.
- Yeah.

20:27.694 --> 20:30.330
**

20:51.183 --> 20:52.852
Hey, I'm sorry.

20:52.852 --> 20:55.622
One of those endless
conference calls.

20:55.622 --> 20:58.791
Everybody talks at once,
nobody says anything.

20:58.791 --> 21:01.093
They all sound like they're
at the bottom of the ocean.

21:01.093 --> 21:02.161
Greg, another lap.

21:02.161 --> 21:03.830
Chivas, neat.

21:04.964 --> 21:07.400
I thought you were
a Templeton girl.

21:07.400 --> 21:08.801
That was a phase.

21:09.969 --> 21:11.938
No more Kiz, no more rye?

21:11.938 --> 21:13.340
You're in a nosy mood.

21:13.340 --> 21:15.342
Couldn't help notice
you're a little blue

21:15.342 --> 21:16.643
around the gills
these days.

21:16.643 --> 21:18.144
It is not that obvious.

21:18.144 --> 21:20.347
I'm a highly experienced
detective.

21:26.786 --> 21:29.389
That all started to go south
after you got suspended.

21:29.389 --> 21:30.923
None of my business.

21:30.923 --> 21:33.460
Mm, she met someone else--

21:33.460 --> 21:36.128
younger, more age appropriate.

21:36.128 --> 21:38.365
I'll spare you
the gory details.

21:38.365 --> 21:40.166
She put in for a transfer.

21:40.166 --> 21:41.734
It was a big relief
for both of us

21:41.734 --> 21:43.536
- when it finally came through.
- I'll bet.

21:44.637 --> 21:46.105
Gave me the fucking cactus

21:46.105 --> 21:48.274
and went on her merry way.

21:48.274 --> 21:49.509
I actually know how you feel.

21:49.509 --> 21:51.210
Yes, I know you do.

21:51.210 --> 21:53.245
To the company dock.

21:53.245 --> 21:54.947
Company dock.

21:58.250 --> 21:59.986
We'll never
speak of this again.

21:59.986 --> 22:01.854
Thank you, sailor.

22:05.558 --> 22:07.394
**

22:30.850 --> 22:31.951
Hey, Eleanor.

22:31.951 --> 22:33.319
Maddie says you called
the other night?

22:33.319 --> 22:34.654
Yeah.

22:34.654 --> 22:37.189
Just checking in.
How are things?

22:37.189 --> 22:38.758
Fine.

22:38.758 --> 22:40.292
She tells me
Reggie's out of town.

22:40.292 --> 22:42.294
Yeah, for a few weeks.

22:42.294 --> 22:44.263
Everything okay?

22:44.263 --> 22:45.432
Why wouldn't it be?

22:45.432 --> 22:48.234
No. No reason.

22:48.234 --> 22:50.336
It's just some business he has
to take care of over there.

22:50.336 --> 22:53.005
I'd be happy to look in
on you guys if you'd like.

22:53.005 --> 22:55.074
No need.

22:55.074 --> 22:57.143
We're managing.

22:57.143 --> 23:00.513
We always do.
Maddie's actually helping out

23:00.513 --> 23:03.450
around the house
without being told.

23:03.450 --> 23:04.984
I think she might
actually be

23:04.984 --> 23:05.785
growing up.

23:05.785 --> 23:07.119
You two getting along?

23:08.521 --> 23:10.056
She's 15,
and I'm her mother.

23:10.056 --> 23:11.123
Okay.

23:11.123 --> 23:12.559
It's normal.

23:12.559 --> 23:14.126
I'd love to see you guys.

23:14.126 --> 23:16.796
Yeah. I'm sure Maddie
would love to see you, too.

23:16.796 --> 23:18.230
She says you're back at work?

23:18.230 --> 23:19.999
Yeah, working a case--

23:19.999 --> 23:21.534
They might even
bring me out there.

23:21.534 --> 23:23.202
Okay, well, let us know.

23:23.202 --> 23:25.304
Listen, I should jump off.

23:25.304 --> 23:26.573
- She there?
- Movies.

23:26.573 --> 23:28.508
Is it a date?

23:28.508 --> 23:30.643
No, it's her friend group.

23:30.643 --> 23:32.144
Is it like a date?

23:32.144 --> 23:34.481
Kids don't go out
on dates these days.

23:34.481 --> 23:35.715
They go out in groups.

23:35.715 --> 23:37.817
Smart. I like that.

23:37.817 --> 23:40.119
Something about
modern life you like.

23:40.119 --> 23:43.355
There's a lot of things
I like about modern life.

23:43.355 --> 23:45.257
- Such as?
- DNA testing.

23:45.257 --> 23:46.493
Hmm.

23:46.493 --> 23:47.494
Good night, Harry.

23:47.494 --> 23:48.628
Good night, Eleanor.

23:58.170 --> 24:00.507
Please, have a seat.

24:00.507 --> 24:03.710
Get you anything?
Coffee, water?

24:03.710 --> 24:04.844
I'm fine, thanks.

24:04.844 --> 24:06.646
Thank you for coming, Irv.

24:06.646 --> 24:08.781
I know you're a busy man.

24:08.781 --> 24:10.883
I can't be any busier
than you, Mr. Mayor.

24:10.883 --> 24:12.985
Since we're both so busy,
I'll cut right to it.

24:12.985 --> 24:14.521
There's an election
on the horizon.

24:14.521 --> 24:15.755
You may have heard.

24:15.755 --> 24:17.389
I would like your endorsement.

24:17.389 --> 24:19.726
It would mean a lot to me.

24:19.726 --> 24:22.529
It would mean a lot to this city
to have you on our team.

24:24.531 --> 24:26.533
I'm flattered.

24:26.533 --> 24:30.670
But I've always thought police
should stay out of politics.

24:30.670 --> 24:32.539
Above the fray.

24:34.206 --> 24:36.743
So why are you about
to endorse Rick O'Shea?

24:36.743 --> 24:40.680
The thing about secrets
in this town is...

24:40.680 --> 24:42.549
they have a short shelf life.

24:44.383 --> 24:46.152
He's asked.

24:46.152 --> 24:47.754
I'm considering it.

24:47.754 --> 24:49.722
You and Reverend Ott.

24:49.722 --> 24:51.591
This Sunday
at Greater Page Temple.

24:51.591 --> 24:54.561
I'm assuming he's made you
some promises.

24:54.561 --> 24:57.730
Vis a vis the department.
More funding.

24:57.730 --> 24:59.098
Pie in the sky.

24:59.098 --> 25:00.132
Chief of Police?

25:01.934 --> 25:04.403
Nothing's set in stone.

25:04.403 --> 25:05.471
I'm glad to hear that.

25:05.471 --> 25:07.139
The West Side mad at you?

25:07.139 --> 25:11.443
The novelty has worn off.

25:11.443 --> 25:12.845
Where'd you come up?

25:12.845 --> 25:15.615
West Adams.
Where'd you come up?

25:15.615 --> 25:16.949
Highland Park.

25:16.949 --> 25:19.719
Oh. Then you're familiar
with the Avenues.

25:19.719 --> 25:24.090
The street gang? Sure,
they've been in Highland Park
for generations.

25:24.090 --> 25:25.658
Back in the day,

25:25.658 --> 25:28.227
the Avenues had standing
orders from La Eme.

25:28.227 --> 25:31.764
To kill any black person
who came into Highland Park.
On sight.

25:31.764 --> 25:34.500
I've heard the stories.
I assumed they were apocryphal.

25:34.500 --> 25:36.368
Oh, far from it.

25:36.368 --> 25:39.371
Then imagine what we could do
together to mend our histories.

25:39.371 --> 25:42.842
To bring black
and brown together.

25:42.842 --> 25:45.845
I have more in common
with you, Irv,
as a native Angeleno,

25:45.845 --> 25:49.749
than I do with an immigrant
from Honduras or a gangbanger
from El Salvador.

25:49.749 --> 25:53.720
And my Spanish isn't
that hot either.

25:53.720 --> 25:56.088
Mejor que lo mio.

25:56.088 --> 25:58.524
Seguro que tu mama
no es Chicana?

26:01.794 --> 26:02.962
I'll ask her.

26:07.767 --> 26:08.935
And Tenzer?

26:10.637 --> 26:12.104
He's had a good run.

26:12.104 --> 26:14.006
He can't be Chief
of Police forever.

26:16.676 --> 26:18.177
Will you think it over, Irv?

26:20.780 --> 26:23.482
I will think it over, Hector.

26:23.482 --> 26:25.952
In fact, I'll pray on it.

26:27.319 --> 26:28.721
Thank you.

26:43.703 --> 26:45.938
Been mining his computer
all night.

26:45.938 --> 26:48.174
Tip of the iceberg,
but enough to know Allen

26:48.174 --> 26:50.677
was washing big bucks through
his production company.

26:50.677 --> 26:51.978
The skin flicks.

26:51.978 --> 26:53.946
On the books, budgets
of under half a mil.

26:53.946 --> 26:56.115
Production, distribution,
marketing.

26:56.115 --> 26:57.917
They couldn't cost more
than fifty,

26:57.917 --> 26:59.886
seventy K apiece to make.
It's a ten to one ratio.

26:59.886 --> 27:02.088
What's the exact mechanism?

27:02.088 --> 27:04.056
Big checks
to dummy corporations

27:04.056 --> 27:06.092
and vendors
for investment costs.

27:06.092 --> 27:09.796
The films come out,
more big checks to "investors".

27:09.796 --> 27:12.999
Phony income from DVD
and online streaming.

27:12.999 --> 27:14.333
Ninety cents
on the dollar.

27:14.333 --> 27:16.435
Feds must've known
what he was up to.

27:16.435 --> 27:17.569
Bigger fish to fry.

27:17.569 --> 27:19.405
Anything from
the phone records?

27:19.405 --> 27:22.308
Lotta calls to and from
a strip club in Vegas
called Dolly's.

27:22.308 --> 27:24.310
Including
the last one he ever got.

27:24.310 --> 27:26.779
Hmm. Girlfriend
or just business?

27:29.782 --> 27:32.418
This was in his wallet.

27:32.418 --> 27:35.154
Oh. Pretty. Girlfriend?

27:35.154 --> 27:37.389
- I'm betting.
- His wife said
he had a new one.

27:37.389 --> 27:40.392
- Any names yet?
- Not yet.

27:40.392 --> 27:42.528
Well, Girlfriend in Vegas.

27:42.528 --> 27:45.397
Let's assume Allen
was bringing that cash
back from Vegas.

27:45.397 --> 27:47.934
I am thinking you
need to go to Vegas.

27:47.934 --> 27:50.302
- Start with Allen's hotel.
- I was just gonna suggest that.

27:50.302 --> 27:52.204
Plus you can check in
on your wife and kid.

27:52.204 --> 27:54.140
- Make sure that you do.
- Roger that.

27:54.140 --> 27:56.909
Viva Las Vegas.
What about me?

27:56.909 --> 27:59.145
You have to stay here
and finish the financials.

27:59.145 --> 28:00.212
What you get for being
so tech savvy.

28:00.212 --> 28:02.548
Harry in Vegas.
What a waste.

28:02.548 --> 28:05.451
I could be all up in
the Champagne Room
at the Spearmint,

28:05.451 --> 28:06.753
making it rain for the ladies.

28:06.753 --> 28:08.154
Another reason
you're not going.

28:08.154 --> 28:10.957
But I'll get you a t-shirt.

28:10.957 --> 28:13.592
I'll drive over tonight,
when it's cooler.

28:13.592 --> 28:16.763
After I talk to Veronica Allen
about her husband's business.

28:16.763 --> 28:18.564
Okay. Good work, guys.

28:18.564 --> 28:22.034
Jerry. Go home,
shower, take a nap.
You look like shit.

28:22.034 --> 28:25.471
I feel like shit,
now that you mention it.

28:25.471 --> 28:28.040
Bosch. Before you leave town,
Irving has something for you.

28:29.942 --> 28:32.779
Detective, you can
come in now.

28:32.779 --> 28:33.980
Thank you, Ida.

28:36.783 --> 28:37.884
Chief.

28:40.119 --> 28:41.320
Bosch.

28:49.361 --> 28:50.963
What's this?

28:50.963 --> 28:53.532
Audio surveillance
from Anthony Allen's office,

28:53.532 --> 28:55.501
his office phone,
his cell phone, and his car.

28:55.501 --> 28:57.369
What about his house?

28:57.369 --> 28:59.872
Said they weren't up
on the house.
Excluded from the warrant.

28:59.872 --> 29:02.474
Meaning if they had it,
they wouldn't give it to us.

29:02.474 --> 29:04.176
I'm assured this is
the pertinent material.

29:04.176 --> 29:07.413
- Was it hard to get?
- Suspiciously easy.

29:07.413 --> 29:09.248
- It's been redacted.
- No doubt.

29:09.248 --> 29:11.250
What'd you have
to give them?

29:12.418 --> 29:14.320
Full report on what
we know so far.

29:14.320 --> 29:16.588
What'd they say about
the cash in his car?

29:16.588 --> 29:18.224
Didn't blink.

29:18.224 --> 29:20.226
Said they were aware of his
possible criminal activities.

29:20.226 --> 29:22.962
They shed any light
on those activities?

29:22.962 --> 29:25.331
Only to reiterate

29:25.331 --> 29:27.733
that they were unconnected
to their larger investigation,

29:27.733 --> 29:28.901
but please keep them
in the loop,

29:28.901 --> 29:30.469
which I promised to do.

29:30.469 --> 29:31.603
And in return they promise

29:31.603 --> 29:33.539
to keep us in the dark
and feed us shit.

29:33.539 --> 29:37.276
With the Feds, it does tend
to be a one-way street.

29:37.276 --> 29:39.345
Any idea what they're up to?

29:39.345 --> 29:42.949
"A matter
of national security."

29:42.949 --> 29:47.486
Right. Thanks for going
to bat on this.

29:47.486 --> 29:50.189
Bosch.

29:50.189 --> 29:52.624
Try to stay clear
of whatever this is.

29:52.624 --> 29:55.995
- Above both our pay grades.
- Do my best.

30:05.304 --> 30:06.772
Harry.

30:06.772 --> 30:08.875
Carl.

30:08.875 --> 30:10.076
Here to see Mrs. Allen.
Is she home?

30:10.076 --> 30:11.978
Yeah. How's it going?

30:11.978 --> 30:15.181
You know.
One step at a time.

30:15.181 --> 30:18.117
It's a grind.
I remember.

30:18.117 --> 30:20.019
Your partner was here yesterday,
looking at footage.

30:20.019 --> 30:23.455
Yeah, he said it was exciting,
watching the UPS guy come
and go.

30:23.455 --> 30:26.158
She hasn't been
out of her house in days.

30:28.460 --> 30:29.996
You got a take on
the Allens at all?

30:32.498 --> 30:35.267
Quiet.

30:35.267 --> 30:38.370
Didn't socialize much
with the neighbors.

30:38.370 --> 30:40.672
I mean, that's typical
up here, though.

30:40.672 --> 30:43.175
- People like their privacy.
- You know what he did
for a living?

30:43.175 --> 30:46.045
- Media consultant.
- He tell you that?

30:46.045 --> 30:48.214
Mm-hmm.
They both did.

30:48.214 --> 30:49.515
What about visitors?

30:49.515 --> 30:52.384
The usual amount.
Friends and family.

30:52.384 --> 30:54.954
- His, hers?
- Mostly his, I guess.

30:54.954 --> 30:56.688
You said he was
out of town a lot.

30:56.688 --> 30:57.890
- Yeah.
- What about her?

30:57.890 --> 30:59.959
She traveled, too, sometimes.

30:59.959 --> 31:02.328
- He ever here on his own?
- Sure.

31:10.569 --> 31:12.638
This girl ever visit Tony here
when he was by himself?

31:12.638 --> 31:14.673
Don't ring a bell.

31:14.673 --> 31:17.376
You wanna leave that?
I'll ask the crew.

31:17.376 --> 31:18.644
- Thanks, brother.
- Yeah.

31:18.644 --> 31:20.412
Let me call Mrs. Allen.

31:38.764 --> 31:41.000
Does it feel
like rain to you?

31:41.000 --> 31:43.169
About your husband's
business affairs--

31:43.169 --> 31:46.072
It's so humid. Radio says

31:46.072 --> 31:49.441
it's what's left of
a hurricane down in Baja.

31:49.441 --> 31:52.111
I can always tell when it's
the tail end of a storm

31:52.111 --> 31:53.579
blowing up the coast
from Mexico.

31:54.981 --> 31:56.848
So sultry.

31:56.848 --> 31:58.350
Mrs. Allen?

32:03.455 --> 32:05.992
I didn't want to know,
particularly.

32:05.992 --> 32:07.826
And Tony certainly
wasn't forthcoming.

32:07.826 --> 32:10.329
Did you know your husband
was laundering money

32:10.329 --> 32:11.998
through his
production company?

32:11.998 --> 32:13.699
- I'm not surprised.
- You're not?

32:13.699 --> 32:15.001
I'm not stupid.

32:15.001 --> 32:17.136
I know what it costs
to live the way we live.

32:17.136 --> 32:19.905
I signed the tax returns.
I even read them.

32:19.905 --> 32:21.273
Were they phony?

32:21.273 --> 32:23.009
No, scrupulously accurate.

32:23.009 --> 32:24.476
He wasn't going to get
caught out like that.

32:24.476 --> 32:26.378
- He usually got a tax refund.
- Did you ever meet

32:26.378 --> 32:28.347
any of your husband's
business associates?

32:29.715 --> 32:30.816
I heard the late night calls.

32:30.816 --> 32:32.051
Can you tell me about those?

32:32.051 --> 32:33.285
I can't.

32:33.285 --> 32:34.620
Why not?

32:34.620 --> 32:38.057
Because I don't speak
Russian or Armenian.

32:38.057 --> 32:40.026
- And he spoke both?
- Fluently.

32:40.026 --> 32:41.393
Do you remember
any of the names

32:41.393 --> 32:43.029
of your husband's
business associates?

32:45.031 --> 32:49.368
Richard, Tom, Charles, Joe.

32:49.368 --> 32:51.703
What about the companies
he did business with?

32:53.372 --> 32:55.141
My husband was a clever man.

32:55.141 --> 32:58.110
He always made sure I was...

32:58.110 --> 33:01.347
insulated
from his business concerns.

33:01.347 --> 33:03.615
I knew he was a pornographer,
and that was sufficient.

33:03.615 --> 33:05.784
Mrs. Allen, did you
embrace your husband

33:05.784 --> 33:07.153
the last time
you saw him?

33:08.487 --> 33:09.655
Why do you ask?

33:09.655 --> 33:11.223
Well, we found a handprint
on his jacket.

33:11.223 --> 33:12.924
Looks like a woman's hand.

33:12.924 --> 33:15.494
- It's on the shoulder.
- And you think it's mine.

33:15.494 --> 33:17.496
When you have a chance,
if you could come
by the station

33:17.496 --> 33:21.333
so they could print you
for comparison.

33:21.333 --> 33:24.070
It's not necessary.
My prints are in the system.

33:26.738 --> 33:28.540
I did some escort calls.

33:29.675 --> 33:31.277
I was young and stupid.

33:31.277 --> 33:34.246
Got picked up
a couple of times.

33:34.246 --> 33:35.614
It was a long time ago.

33:37.183 --> 33:38.617
Did your husband
know about it?

33:38.617 --> 33:39.851
He did.

33:39.851 --> 33:40.886
Did it bother him?

33:40.886 --> 33:42.288
It didn't.

33:44.290 --> 33:45.724
Well, I'm still
going to need you

33:45.724 --> 33:48.427
to come by anyway.
They'll want a fresh print.

33:48.427 --> 33:50.629
Like you said,
it was a long time ago.

33:52.431 --> 33:54.466
I don't think
it was mine, detective.

33:56.435 --> 33:59.338
The last time I saw Tony,
I didn't touch him.

34:00.606 --> 34:02.174
Thank you.

34:29.568 --> 34:33.739
All right, follow my lead
exactly as we discussed.

34:33.739 --> 34:37.143
No freelance. Do not go off
the reservation, all right?

34:37.143 --> 34:39.145
- Yeah.
- All right, let's go.

35:36.868 --> 35:37.903
Uhh!

35:37.903 --> 35:40.239
Get in there.
Do as I say.

35:40.239 --> 35:42.308
I'll fucking kill you.

35:42.308 --> 35:43.975
- Get in here.
- Okay, George.

35:43.975 --> 35:45.344
All right.
That's good.

35:45.344 --> 35:47.646
That's enough.
Let him go.

35:47.646 --> 35:49.281
Asshole, man.

35:49.281 --> 35:52.684
The fuck?

35:52.684 --> 35:54.085
What the fuck?

35:54.085 --> 35:56.222
What's your name,
ese?

35:57.823 --> 35:59.024
Tito.

35:59.024 --> 36:01.527
Tito.

36:03.662 --> 36:06.298
Is that your hidey hole
up there?

36:09.401 --> 36:11.737
Aw, come on, man. George.

36:14.240 --> 36:15.641
Oof!

36:20.979 --> 36:22.514
Okay.

36:22.514 --> 36:23.749
Ohh.

36:25.251 --> 36:26.585
Aha.

36:26.585 --> 36:28.454
Hey, listen,
if you want to make sure

36:28.454 --> 36:30.989
that shit like this doesn't
happen to you again,

36:30.989 --> 36:33.759
you are going to need
some insurance, brother.

36:33.759 --> 36:35.327
Come on, man.

36:35.327 --> 36:37.429
Relax. You're going
to get to keep your brick.

36:37.429 --> 36:40.432
We're not here to interfere
with neighborhood commerce.

36:41.933 --> 36:43.635
Huh.

36:43.635 --> 36:47.005
Your boys buy
direct from Sinaloa?

36:47.005 --> 36:48.940
That's interesting.

36:48.940 --> 36:52.344
All right. Consider this
a weekly thing, Tito:

36:52.344 --> 36:54.746
sales tax Fridays.

36:54.746 --> 36:58.350
Hey, no, cheer up.
This isn't a one-way street.

36:58.350 --> 37:00.986
You need a tip on a raid,
a competitor dimed out,

37:00.986 --> 37:02.621
we can help you with that.

37:02.621 --> 37:06.191
You two fuckers some real
tough pendejos, huh?

37:06.191 --> 37:09.895
You fuck with us,
you fuck with all of us.

37:09.895 --> 37:11.463
Uhh!

37:13.665 --> 37:15.501
All right, George,
that's enough.

37:15.501 --> 37:16.835
That's enough.

37:19.838 --> 37:21.973
Come on, let's go.

37:31.116 --> 37:32.951
Next time,
use your baton.

37:32.951 --> 37:35.454
Those little Pelicans,
they're not worth shit,

37:35.454 --> 37:37.423
not like the old
Maglites.

37:37.423 --> 37:39.991
Those bad boys, they can
do some serious damage.

37:39.991 --> 37:41.760
Right.

37:41.760 --> 37:43.729
Oh, boy.

37:46.332 --> 37:47.999
I might have
something else lined up

37:47.999 --> 37:49.401
in the next
couple of days.

37:49.401 --> 37:50.936
Oh, really?

37:50.936 --> 37:52.371
What?

37:52.371 --> 37:53.905
I'll let you know.

38:18.196 --> 38:19.531
Harry.

38:19.531 --> 38:21.032
The movie Veronica Allen
did with her husband--

38:21.032 --> 38:23.435
- The porno?
- No, no, the other one,

38:23.435 --> 38:26.772
Victim of the Night.

38:26.772 --> 38:29.541
See if you can track down
anyone involved with it--

38:29.541 --> 38:34.179
director, producer, actors,

38:34.179 --> 38:35.381
anyone who worked with her.

38:35.381 --> 38:36.715
Anything in particular?

38:36.715 --> 38:39.217
I just want to know what
she was like back then.

38:39.217 --> 38:40.786
I'll look into it.

38:40.786 --> 38:42.087
Thanks, brother.

39:00.606 --> 39:03.074
Hey, Mom, is Dad around?

39:03.074 --> 39:04.476
No, he's working late.

39:04.476 --> 39:05.744
You try his cell?

39:05.744 --> 39:07.112
Yeah. It went to voice mail.

39:07.112 --> 39:09.481
I just, uh, I wanted to bend
his ear for a minute.

39:09.481 --> 39:11.082
- Thought I might catch him.
- You in a rush?

39:11.082 --> 39:12.418
- Kind of, yeah.
- Sit.

39:12.418 --> 39:13.885
Talk with your mom
for a few minutes.

39:18.089 --> 39:19.725
How was your day?

39:21.026 --> 39:22.894
Oh, you know, it was--

39:22.894 --> 39:24.095
it was fine.

39:25.431 --> 39:28.500
Beginnings.
They're always tough.

39:29.801 --> 39:31.770
- I'm sorry?
- I know you.

39:31.770 --> 39:33.204
It takes you a while
to fit in.

39:33.204 --> 39:37.042
You've always been cautious
in a new situation.

39:37.042 --> 39:39.978
Yeah, well, it's working out.
I'm getting comfortable.

39:39.978 --> 39:42.581
Yeah. I hope you didn't
wear that outfit to work.

39:42.581 --> 39:46.084
No. Jacket and tie, Mom.
I always dress correct.

39:47.218 --> 39:48.687
Want some dinner?

39:48.687 --> 39:49.555
Uh...

39:49.555 --> 39:51.322
- Yeah.
- Mom--

39:51.322 --> 39:52.524
- Hey.
- Mom!

39:52.524 --> 39:54.826
Let me fix you
something to eat.

40:02.734 --> 40:04.470
Dressing room, Dolly's

40:04.470 --> 40:05.804
Layla there?

40:05.804 --> 40:08.173
- Tony?
- Hey, babe.

40:08.173 --> 40:10.476
Hey. You back already?

40:10.476 --> 40:12.110
Yeah. Made decent time.

40:12.110 --> 40:14.646
Did you have time to go
by the other place too?

40:14.646 --> 40:16.181
I'll tell you about it
when I see you,

40:16.181 --> 40:17.816
- not on the phone.
- Just making sure.

40:17.816 --> 40:19.551
You got nothing
to worry about, baby.

40:27.058 --> 40:28.226
Harry.

40:28.226 --> 40:29.394
Hope it's not too late.

40:29.394 --> 40:31.162
I just got home. What's up?

40:31.162 --> 40:32.598
Headed your way,
actually.

40:32.598 --> 40:34.500
I told you we're fine.

40:34.500 --> 40:36.334
It's that case
I told you about.

40:36.334 --> 40:38.637
Our victim
did business there.

40:38.637 --> 40:40.105
How long you staying?

40:40.105 --> 40:42.440
I don't know. A few days.

40:43.842 --> 40:46.444
I was hoping I might be
able to connect with Maddie,

40:46.444 --> 40:48.146
you know, some time tomorrow.

40:48.146 --> 40:50.448
Yeah, you can
pick her up after camp.

40:50.448 --> 40:52.217
I'll text you the address.

40:52.217 --> 40:54.285
Okay.

40:54.285 --> 40:56.354
I'll, uh, see you then.

40:56.354 --> 40:57.823
Good night, Harry.

41:05.330 --> 41:06.765
Hey, doll.

41:06.765 --> 41:08.534
Tony, I'm scared.

41:08.534 --> 41:10.536
Don't worry, baby.
It won't be long,

41:10.536 --> 41:11.770
just a few more weeks.

41:11.770 --> 41:13.071
A few weeks?

41:13.071 --> 41:14.840
Everything's
going to be fine.

41:14.840 --> 41:16.007
If he finds out--

41:16.007 --> 41:17.776
He won't.
He won't find out.

41:17.776 --> 41:19.377
What about her?

41:19.377 --> 41:21.580
She doesn't care.
