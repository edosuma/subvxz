MICHAEL: I've done one or two
decent things in my life, Peter,

00:03.920 --> 00:05.720
I really have,
but I never flash back to them.

00:05.800 --> 00:06.800
She's dying!

00:06.880 --> 00:08.200
She can't be left alone overnight.

00:08.280 --> 00:10.240
-The body of Christ.
-Amen.

00:12.200 --> 00:13.960
I'm gonna pay it all back. Every penny.

00:14.160 --> 00:17.320
The machines in Saint Nick's
are nothing like those in your shops.

00:17.400 --> 00:20.640
Ours take 10-pence coins,
yours take 10-pound notes.

00:20.720 --> 00:22.280
If he doesn't watch my back,

00:22.360 --> 00:23.600
then why should I watch his?

00:23.800 --> 00:25.400
Why should anyone watch his?

00:25.640 --> 00:27.360
Blinded and killed, Dawn.

White officer kills black boy
on your watch

00:31.320 --> 00:32.640

00:32.720 --> 00:35.000
The officer who used the spray

00:35.080 --> 00:37.520
said she did so because she feared
for Miss Oyenusi's safety.

00:37.600 --> 00:38.720
That's not true.

He was betrayed,

01:37.360 --> 01:38.760
He himself took bread

01:39.280 --> 01:40.760
and, giving you thanks,

01:42.040 --> 01:43.120
He said the blessing,

01:44.160 --> 01:45.160
broke the bread

01:46.160 --> 01:48.200

CORONER: I have two things to say
to you, members of the jury.

04:55.120 --> 04:57.200
First, you'll remember that we opened
and adjourned this inquest

04:57.280 --> 04:58.480
pending the findings

04:58.560 --> 05:00.400
of the Independent
Police Complaints Commission.

05:00.680 --> 05:02.680
The Commission has decided
that no action should be taken

05:02.760 --> 05:05.080
against any officer
involved in this case

05:05.360 --> 05:07.000
and so this inquest can now resume.

05:07.720 --> 05:10.880
Second, I'll introduce
the various interested parties to you.

05:11.400 --> 05:12.840
Starting on my left, we have

05:13.360 --> 05:16.080
Mr Lambert,
representing Patricia Greaves

05:16.160 --> 05:18.480
of the North West

05:19.000 --> 05:21.640
Mr Marsh,

Mr Lloyd, representing
Police Sergeant Denis Kilcaid

05:52.080 --> 05:54.120

05:57.960 --> 05:59.880

And over here, we have Mrs
Helen Oyenusi, representing herself.

06:06.600 --> 06:08.320
But Eastbrook wasn't all bad.

06:09.480 --> 06:10.760
There was Saint Nick's.

06:11.720 --> 06:12.880
And Father Michael.

06:13.320 --> 06:15.000
He and Vernon got on well.

06:15.560 --> 06:17.560
And I was
so grateful for that because...

06:19.720 --> 06:21.720
he wouldn't take his medication,
you see,

06:22.400 --> 06:23.560
unless he trusted you.

06:24.080 --> 06:26.840
But the sicker he got,
the less he trusted you.

06:27.240 --> 06:30.800
The sicker he got,
the more he needed the medicine,

06:31.200 --> 06:32.960
the less chance of him ever taking it.

06:33.840 --> 06:36.480
But Father Michael always
managed to persuade him.

06:37.920 --> 06:38.960
Always.

06:40.440 --> 06:42.840
Had Father Michael
been around that night,

06:44.120 --> 06:45.800
Vernon would still be alive,

06:46.840 --> 06:47.840

I am black,

06:51.240 --> 06:53.600

06:54.880 --> 06:58.760
I should, therefore, forgive everyone
involved in the death of my son

06:58.840 --> 07:01.520
and astonish you all
with the strength of my faith.

07:02.480 --> 07:04.160
I will not play that game.

07:05.600 --> 07:09.200
I will not forgive people
who have not asked to be forgiven.

07:09.480 --> 07:13.360
I will not forgive people
who lied to the IPCC

07:13.440 --> 07:15.800

09:28.160 --> 09:29.680
Her name's Chloe Demichelis.

09:30.880 --> 09:32.280
Her mother was Roz Demichelis.

09:32.360 --> 09:35.960
She lost a lot of money
on these machines

09:37.160 --> 09:40.160
and, er, she took her own life.

-What's wrong?
-Sciatica.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.240
They're just machines, Chloe.

10:03.320 --> 10:04.640

10:04.720 --> 10:06.880
but they're just machines
and machines are replaceable.

10:06.960 --> 10:08.080
People are not.

10:09.680 --> 10:13.920
I was really saddened to hear
about your mother, Chloe,

10:14.080 --> 10:15.800
and you have all my sympathy, my love.

10:16.640 --> 10:19.000
Now, I'm not saying
we didn't profit from her losses,

10:19.080 --> 10:20.080
because we did,

10:20.520 --> 10:22.880
but others profited a hell of a lot more

10:22.960 --> 10:24.880
and you can't say that
if we'd refused her custom,

10:24.960 --> 10:26.200
it would have made any difference,

10:26.280 --> 10:29.000
'cause it wouldn't,
Chloe, my love, it wouldn't.

10:32.360 --> 10:34.640
I was wondering, Officer,
if it's all right

10:34.720 --> 10:38.280
to just forget this ever happened,
if that's, er, possible at all?

10:38.720 --> 10:39.760
I'm sure it is.

10:42.800 --> 10:46.160
You see, I lost my mother, too, Chloe,
when I was very young.

10:46.920 --> 10:49.200
It was natural causes,
so a lot less, erm...

10:50.080 --> 10:51.560
Well, there are no words are there?

10:52.640 --> 10:54.640
No words to describe
what you've been through

10:54.720 --> 10:56.000
so we'll just leave it at that,

10:56.080 --> 10:57.440
a lot less.

10:58.200 --> 10:59.920
So I understand
why you've done this, Chloe.

11:01.080 --> 11:02.280
I understand it,

11:03.000 --> 11:04.040
I forgive it.

11:04.520 --> 11:05.520
It's forgotten.

11:26.720 --> 11:29.560
We're full but we need to find
a bed from somewhere.

11:35.960 --> 11:38.920
SENIOR CASE WORKER:
So my first response was to say no.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.920
So what if a young man's
desperately ill?

11:42.040 --> 11:44.160
He's not one of ours.
We don't know him,

11:44.240 --> 11:46.480
we don't have to see his suffering,
so say no.

11:47.720 --> 11:50.120
But that'd be cowardly and immoral.

11:51.720 --> 11:52.840
We need to make a decision

11:53.440 --> 11:55.840
and there are...
There are three possibilities.

11:56.880 --> 11:58.080
I lied to Helen,

11:58.400 --> 12:00.640
when I said that Vernon
was the least unwell.

12:01.200 --> 12:03.200
He was one of the least unwell.

12:05.960 --> 12:07.840
But he was certainly the most loved.

12:12.120 --> 12:17.080
Helen had shown herself to be
a wonderful, loving mother

12:18.400 --> 12:21.480
and who could come to any harm
going home to a mother such as that?

12:23.000 --> 12:24.480
That's why we picked Vernon,

12:27.120 --> 12:28.600
because he was so loved.

though, Ryan.

for you, sweetheart.

12:59.640 --> 13:01.880
Lots of people enjoy these machines.

13:01.960 --> 13:04.640
Yeah, okay, a few sad bastards
like your mother get addicted

13:04.720 --> 13:06.000
but that don't mean you ban them.

You don't ban booze 'cause of
a few pissheads, do you?

13:08.600 --> 13:09.640

like your bleeding mother.

-Look at her.
-She's just destroyed

what're you gonna do,
invite her to dinner?

13:21.800 --> 13:22.840
Jesus!

13:24.560 --> 13:26.000
I know what you want, sweetheart,

13:26.240 --> 13:27.360
and you're not gonna get it.

13:27.800 --> 13:30.040
I am not calling the police

13:30.440 --> 13:32.320
so you can go all drama queen on us.

13:32.960 --> 13:34.360
I'm calling a lawyer.

13:34.960 --> 13:37.320
And he'll take out
a restraining order on you

13:37.400 --> 13:39.040
banning you from all of my shops.

13:39.760 --> 13:42.080
So next time you do
your chain-gang thing,

13:42.160 --> 13:43.280
you'll go straight to prison

13:43.640 --> 13:46.920
'cause it's not criminal damage
any more, it's contempt of court.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.920
Contempt of court
means straight to prison

13:49.000 --> 13:50.480
'cause you're not upsetting
little old me,

13:50.560 --> 13:52.560
you're upset a High Court fucking judge.

13:52.840 --> 13:53.840
God bless.

13:58.840 --> 14:00.320
MICHAEL: Will you promise
not to do it again?

14:05.480 --> 14:08.960
What he said was right,
contempt of court, you'd go to prison.

14:12.040 --> 14:13.360
It'll be with you all your life.

14:14.360 --> 14:15.560
It'll stop you getting jobs.

14:16.360 --> 14:17.360
Look,

14:18.280 --> 14:20.480
if I swore to you I'll get him,
this bookie,

14:22.040 --> 14:24.040
will you promise you'll keep away
from those machines?

14:24.240 --> 14:25.840
Are you supposed
to say things like that?

14:26.240 --> 14:27.240
No.

14:29.200 --> 14:30.560
Sunday. Ten o'clock Mass.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
Okay.

14:33.120 --> 14:34.400
Come and see it if you like.

14:35.320 --> 14:36.360
Okay.

14:39.400 --> 14:40.640
-Would you?
-Do you want a hand?

14:40.720 --> 14:41.720
Yeah.

14:47.400 --> 14:48.400
Here.

14:53.640 --> 14:54.920
MICHAEL: The Lord be with you.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.280
CONGREGATION: And also with you.

14:57.320 --> 14:59.560
MICHAEL: A reading from the Holy Gospel
according to Matthew.

15:00.280 --> 15:01.480
ALL: Glory to you, O Lord.

15:02.840 --> 15:04.920
MICHAEL: "And Jesus
entered the Temple of God

15:06.080 --> 15:07.280
"and cast out all those

15:07.360 --> 15:09.160
"who were buying
and selling in the temple

15:09.920 --> 15:12.440
"and he overturned the tables
of the money changers

15:12.520 --> 15:14.520
"and the seats of those
who sold the doves."

15:15.520 --> 15:17.880
And he said to them, "It is written,

15:18.720 --> 15:21.240
"'My house shall be called
a house of prayer,'

15:22.960 --> 15:24.960
"'but you have made it
a den of thieves.'"

15:28.520 --> 15:29.680
The Gospel of the Lord.

15:30.880 --> 15:33.120
ALL: Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ.

15:34.880 --> 15:36.040
MICHAEL: I love that passage,

15:37.480 --> 15:41.320
Christ driving the money changers
out of the temple.

15:41.480 --> 15:43.800
In John's version,
he drives them out with a whip,

15:44.040 --> 15:45.040
even better.

15:45.640 --> 15:48.640
I like it because it...
It shows Christ's humanity.

15:49.240 --> 15:50.720
Even he was prone to anger.

15:51.920 --> 15:52.920
Righteous anger.

15:54.080 --> 15:58.160
As Christians, we're meant
to try and emulate Christ.

15:58.400 --> 16:00.040
Are we allowed to emulate that bit?

16:00.360 --> 16:02.520
Are we allowed a bit of righteous anger?

16:03.760 --> 16:04.800
I hope so.

16:07.200 --> 16:08.720
There's a young woman here today,

16:09.800 --> 16:10.840
Chloe,

16:11.800 --> 16:15.080
whose mother took her own life
very recently.

16:15.480 --> 16:18.160
She got addicted to those machines
in the betting shop

16:19.680 --> 16:21.320
and she stole from her employer

16:22.360 --> 16:23.760
and she couldn't live with her shame.

16:23.960 --> 16:25.480
Does that not make you angry?

16:27.920 --> 16:30.400
Those machines take up to £100 per spin

16:30.480 --> 16:32.680
and they spin three times a minute.

16:32.760 --> 16:36.000
Ten times faster
than the fastest croupier on the planet.

16:36.320 --> 16:39.360
So fast in fact that, if you
walked in there with £1,000,

16:39.440 --> 16:41.240
you'd be skint in less than ten minutes.

16:41.880 --> 16:44.040
Nobody walks in with £1,000, of course,

16:44.120 --> 16:47.080
because these machines are in
our poorest areas.

16:47.160 --> 16:48.960
16 in Hall Cross Road.

16:49.040 --> 16:50.040
Why is that?

16:50.920 --> 16:53.640
Because if you've only got a fiver
to last you the rest of the week,

16:53.720 --> 16:55.520
it makes eminent sense to gamble it.

16:56.160 --> 16:58.720
So 16 machines in Hall Cross Road,

16:58.800 --> 17:00.800
all feeding off our poverty.

17:00.920 --> 17:02.480
Does that not make you angry?

17:03.320 --> 17:06.600
And these machines, well,
they're a capitalist's dream.

17:06.880 --> 17:08.600
They don't need food or shelter.

17:08.720 --> 17:09.920
They don't need wages.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.440
You just buy them
and line them up against the wall

17:12.520 --> 17:15.360
and off they go, sucking up our money.

17:15.440 --> 17:16.520
Our money.

17:17.040 --> 17:20.160
Money from one of the poorest
communities in Western Europe

17:20.240 --> 17:22.760
given to shareholders
living in the rich South East.

17:22.920 --> 17:24.320
Does that not make you angry?

17:26.960 --> 17:28.560
But these are just machines.

17:30.560 --> 17:32.680
Christ, in righteous anger,

17:33.240 --> 17:35.080
took a whip to human beings.

17:35.360 --> 17:39.480
If we, in righteous anger,
took a hammer to those machines,

17:39.560 --> 17:42.320
would we be condemned or applauded?

17:43.240 --> 17:45.240
(APPLAUSE)

19:08.800 --> 19:10.400
DENIS: I didn't volunteer
for armed response,

19:10.480 --> 19:11.480
they asked me to join.

19:12.360 --> 19:14.880
I went away and thought about it
for days

19:15.720 --> 19:16.760
and went back and said yes.

19:18.160 --> 19:19.680
And I didn't do it for the kudos

19:19.920 --> 19:22.440
because no one, apart from a chosen few,
ever knew I was in it.

19:24.040 --> 19:26.560
And I didn't do it because I relished
the prospect of shooting someone,

19:26.640 --> 19:28.480
I honestly hoped
it would never come to that.

19:30.560 --> 19:32.680
They asked me if I was sure
I could do it,

19:33.440 --> 19:34.440
shoot someone.

19:36.120 --> 19:38.320
I said I would only know that
if and when it came to it

19:38.400 --> 19:39.640
and anyone who told you different

19:39.720 --> 19:41.920
was a fool and shouldn't be
in armed response in the first place.

19:44.120 --> 19:45.720
And now I know of course, I could do it.

19:46.520 --> 19:48.880
PC Andrew Powell was at the door
when I get there

19:50.200 --> 19:53.280
but no sooner am I out of the car
than he's trying to force the door open.

19:53.360 --> 19:54.400
I don't know why.

19:54.960 --> 19:56.160
He disappears inside.

19:56.600 --> 19:59.840
Vernon Oyenusi comes out
with his hand to his face like that.

20:01.720 --> 20:03.000
I now know he'd been sprayed.

20:03.200 --> 20:04.280
I didn't know that then.

20:04.680 --> 20:06.400
Then I thought he'd been punched or...

20:06.880 --> 20:08.880
he was trying to hide his face
for some reason.

20:09.440 --> 20:11.120
He starts shouting, "I'm blind,"

20:11.320 --> 20:13.360
and he's coming towards me
waving that knife.

20:13.520 --> 20:14.600
"I'm blind. I'm blind!"

20:15.120 --> 20:16.240
But if he really is blind,

20:16.320 --> 20:18.000
how come he's heading straight for me?

20:18.120 --> 20:19.200
How come he knows where I am?

20:20.080 --> 20:22.240
And if he is really blind,
that's only gonna make it worse

20:22.320 --> 20:23.480
'cause he's waving that knife about

20:23.560 --> 20:25.440
and he could cut anybody
without even knowing it.

20:27.800 --> 20:30.040
(ECHOES) "Armed police.
Put down the knife."

20:30.200 --> 20:31.200
(VERNON YELLING)

20:31.680 --> 20:33.440
You're trained to say it loud and clear.

20:34.600 --> 20:35.760
"I will fire."

20:36.880 --> 20:39.640
They must be in no doubt whatsoever
that you will pull that trigger.

20:40.880 --> 20:42.680
Loud, clear, firm.

20:43.400 --> 20:45.680
"Put down the knife. I will fire."

God knows what it sounded like
to him, but

20:49.600 --> 20:52.440
in here I'm not loud,
clear and firm at all, in here I'm...

20:53.320 --> 20:55.960
begging with him,
please, please, please stop.

-(VERNON YELLING)
-Put down the knife or I will fire.

20:59.120 --> 21:00.120
He doesn't stop.

21:01.920 --> 21:03.160
And I know I'll have to shoot him.

21:04.920 --> 21:06.440
And the one thing you can't do is miss.

21:06.920 --> 21:08.760
You miss, you hit an innocent bystander,

21:08.840 --> 21:10.760
so you're trained to aim for the chest.

21:13.600 --> 21:14.920
Always the middle of the chest.

21:16.640 --> 21:17.640
I fire.

21:17.720 --> 21:18.720
(GUNSHOTS)

21:21.280 --> 21:22.720
I meant to fire only the once,

21:22.800 --> 21:24.560
but the... the trigger's so sensitive,

21:24.640 --> 21:26.520
it goes off twice
and I immediately think

21:26.600 --> 21:29.080
people are gonna accuse me
of wanting to finish him off but

21:29.560 --> 21:30.560
not at all.

21:31.800 --> 21:32.960
It just went off twice.

Is there anything else
you'd like to add?

21:36.600 --> 21:38.520
Anything that might be relevant
to this inquest?

21:45.960 --> 21:48.760
I've got kids of my own, Mrs Oyenusi.

what you're going through.

Yes.

What happens
when those machines get replaced?

22:38.800 --> 22:40.000
We smash them up again.

22:40.800 --> 22:42.040
They'll put you in prison?

22:42.600 --> 22:43.600
Possibly.

I don't want that.

You can tell me now she's dead.

24:22.480 --> 24:23.520
I can't.

24:24.160 --> 24:25.720
Mum expected to be at home.

24:25.800 --> 24:27.320
You expected her to be at home.

24:27.600 --> 24:29.040
If she had been at home,

24:29.120 --> 24:30.440
I would have found her,
I could have stopped it.

I think she thought
I was going to try and stop her

at the last minute.

If it had been me,

26:27.880 --> 26:28.920
is it relevant?

26:34.320 --> 26:37.560
IAN: He was ranting and raving
well before we put in an appearance

26:38.800 --> 26:40.280
so you can't say we

26:40.360 --> 26:42.600
ratcheted up the tension
by going in there.

26:43.480 --> 26:46.320
That boy should never have been
allowed out of that hospital.

26:46.640 --> 26:49.200
I hear the nurses saying
he was the least unwell.

26:49.680 --> 26:52.880
If that's the case,
I'd hate to see the most.

26:53.640 --> 26:55.880
There was no way he was calming down.

26:56.400 --> 26:59.320
On the contrary,
he was stoking his anger.

27:00.360 --> 27:02.480
I've seen it lots of times,

27:02.560 --> 27:05.000
a man stoking his anger
till he's able to do something

27:05.080 --> 27:08.560
he'd never contemplate
when sober and calm.

27:09.080 --> 27:11.200
I knew I had to use that spray.

27:11.920 --> 27:13.360
Had I not used it,

27:13.440 --> 27:16.120
we would not be at his inquest today,

27:16.560 --> 27:17.840
we would be at his mother's.

27:18.920 --> 27:21.080
I know that Andrew Powell
agrees with this because...

27:21.160 --> 27:22.440
Shame on you girl!

27:22.520 --> 27:25.640
-He started to barge the door...
-Shame on you, girl!

27:25.880 --> 27:27.160
-...round about the same time...
-Shame on you!

27:27.240 --> 27:28.520
CORONER: Mrs Oyenusi! Please.

27:28.600 --> 27:30.160
...trying to get at Vernon,
trying to restrain him.

27:32.240 --> 27:33.800
CORONER: I know how hard this is for you

27:33.880 --> 27:36.000
but, please, Mrs Oyenusi,
you have to let the witness speak.

27:36.080 --> 27:40.040
DAWN: The Taser was out of the question
because of his clothing.

27:40.120 --> 27:42.640
-(PANTING)
-I doubt it would have had any effect.

28:05.600 --> 28:07.720
The truth was
they were sending Vernon home

28:07.800 --> 28:09.600
even though he wasn't well.

28:10.400 --> 28:12.760
So I can understand them lying at first.

28:13.040 --> 28:16.960
But they did go on to tell
the absolute truth and...

28:18.040 --> 28:20.440
I respected them for that
and I'm sure Helen did as well.

28:21.800 --> 28:23.400
CORONER: Is there anything else
you'd like to add?

28:24.320 --> 28:26.480
Anything that's relevant
to this inquest?

28:30.480 --> 28:32.000
Ah, I was dreading that question.

28:33.720 --> 28:34.720
Is there something?

28:38.240 --> 28:41.440
Helen phoned me that night
to say that Vernon was ill.

28:43.200 --> 28:44.720
Er, she got the answering machine...

28:45.160 --> 28:46.160
Erm...

28:47.640 --> 28:52.920
And, erm, I was there as she spoke
but I didn't pick up...

28:57.960 --> 28:59.320
It was, er...

29:00.520 --> 29:02.440
Well, I'd had a busy day and it was...

29:06.240 --> 29:07.520
It was late and I was tired.

29:10.720 --> 29:12.720
Had I gone round there, had I...

29:14.080 --> 29:15.120
Had I picked up,

29:17.520 --> 29:18.880
Vernon might still be alive.

29:33.560 --> 29:35.280
(INAUDIBLE)

30:18.680 --> 30:20.680
ANDREW: I swear by Almighty God

30:20.760 --> 30:23.280
that the evidence I shall give
shall be the truth,

30:23.360 --> 30:25.360
the whole truth
and nothing but the truth.

30:27.920 --> 30:29.600
(SIGHS) And it's gonna cost me.

30:35.040 --> 30:36.840
ANDREW: Ever since PC Dawn Morris

30:37.520 --> 30:39.880
first walked into our nick,
we've given her stick

30:41.120 --> 30:42.200
because she's a woman.

30:43.440 --> 30:45.520
Ever since PC Dawn Morris

30:46.000 --> 30:48.120
first walked into our nick,
she's had to prove

30:49.080 --> 30:51.040
she's as good a copper as any man there.

30:53.880 --> 30:57.120
And I think it's that
that cost Vernon Oyenusi his life.

30:58.800 --> 31:00.200
When I get there,

31:00.840 --> 31:04.600
Vernon's distressed, yes,
but he's not a threat to anyone.

31:06.680 --> 31:07.680
It's as his mother says,

31:09.400 --> 31:10.960
he just needs calming down

31:11.800 --> 31:13.720
and I'm trying to do that until...

31:15.160 --> 31:16.160
(SIGHS)

31:16.240 --> 31:19.320
Dawn and Ian Wakefield suddenly appear
behind Vernon

31:21.160 --> 31:22.640
and scare the living shit out of him.

31:24.920 --> 31:27.080
You see I think Dawn knows
there and then

31:27.640 --> 31:28.720
she's done the wrong thing.

31:30.720 --> 31:31.760
But she can't admit it

31:33.520 --> 31:34.960
because she's a woman in a man's world

31:36.480 --> 31:38.360
and she's got to get
control of the situation,

31:38.720 --> 31:40.560
and prove how decisive she can be.

31:42.720 --> 31:44.840
So, she goes for her spray

31:45.160 --> 31:47.360
and that's when I start barging the door

31:48.000 --> 31:50.080
and it's not to grab Vernon,

31:51.520 --> 31:52.800
which is what Dawn said.

31:54.440 --> 31:58.120
It's to stop Dawn spraying
a mentally ill man.

32:02.520 --> 32:03.960
Now, I'm screaming at her not to do it

32:04.040 --> 32:05.080
and I know it registers.

32:07.720 --> 32:09.320
I know she realises.

32:10.640 --> 32:12.760
Shit, this is a big mistake

32:12.840 --> 32:14.160
but what's she gonna do?

32:14.240 --> 32:16.400
She's already got the canister
in her hand,

32:16.480 --> 32:18.240
she has to use it,
she has to be decisive.

32:21.280 --> 32:22.440
So she sprays him.

32:23.760 --> 32:25.040
And he blunders out.

32:27.560 --> 32:28.840
And we hear two shots.

32:34.000 --> 32:37.240
It is the most stupid thing

32:39.080 --> 32:40.680
I've ever seen a copper do.

33:17.640 --> 33:19.080
CORONER: You've reached your decisions,
I believe.

33:19.200 --> 33:20.240
Yes.

33:21.640 --> 33:23.040
CORONER: How have you answered
question number one?

33:24.280 --> 33:27.080
Did Sergeant Denis Kilcaid
act lawfully or unlawfully

33:27.160 --> 33:28.960
in shooting Vernon Oyenusi?

33:29.320 --> 33:30.360
Lawfully.

33:30.600 --> 33:31.600
CORONER: Thank you.

33:34.560 --> 33:36.400
How have you answered
question number two?

33:37.120 --> 33:40.720
Did PC Dawn Morris
act lawfully or unlawfully

33:40.800 --> 33:42.360
in spraying Vernon Oyenusi?

33:43.000 --> 33:44.160
Unlawfully.

33:45.200 --> 33:46.200
CORONER: Thank you.

33:47.080 --> 33:49.120
And how have you answered
question number three?

33:49.480 --> 33:53.000
Was Vernon Oyenusi
lawfully or unlawfully killed?

33:53.200 --> 33:54.240
Unlawfully.

33:54.920 --> 33:55.960
CORONER: Thank you.

33:57.200 --> 33:58.640
Thank you, members of the jury

33:58.720 --> 34:00.320
for the way you've conducted yourself

34:00.400 --> 34:04.560
throughout this difficult, demanding
and profoundly moving inquest.

34:04.880 --> 34:06.280
I'd like you to leave now,

34:06.360 --> 34:07.720
but if you could wait in the jury room

34:07.800 --> 34:10.040

that each of you has to sign.

34:10.120 --> 34:12.240
I'd also like to thank
the administrative staff

34:12.320 --> 34:13.920

34:14.000 --> 34:16.080
as smoothly
and as efficiently as it did.

34:16.160 --> 34:17.280
Thank you.

34:18.520 --> 34:20.840
And finally, to Mrs Oyenusi,

34:22.160 --> 34:25.280
I wish to offer our deepest sympathy
on the loss of her son.

34:26.200 --> 34:27.880
Vernon's death certificate
will be completed

34:27.960 --> 34:29.600
to reflect the findings of the jury,

34:29.960 --> 34:34.000

on payment of the appropriate fee.

35:45.200 --> 35:46.600
Even when you did tell the truth

35:46.680 --> 35:49.520
you did so only because you were
too frightened to lie on oath.

44:26.520 --> 44:28.520
have compassion on my mother's soul.

44:29.360 --> 44:30.800
Forgive her her sins

44:31.760 --> 44:33.800
and grant that I may see her again

44:34.720 --> 44:37.000
in the joy of eternal brightness.

44:38.960 --> 44:40.280
Through Christ our Lord.

44:42.160 --> 44:43.160
Amen.

45:02.760 --> 45:04.080
Hi, Beth, it's me.

45:06.040 --> 45:07.320
Yeah, she died in the night.

45:08.880 --> 45:11.040
I'm sorry, Beth. I know.

45:11.960 --> 45:13.120
I will.

45:13.960 --> 45:14.960
I will.

45:16.240 --> 45:17.280
Bye.

45:43.240 --> 45:44.400
MICHAEL: Why would I play
in the boys' league

45:44.480 --> 45:45.680
when I was playing for the school?

45:45.760 --> 45:47.000
JOE: 'Cause school football was shite.

45:47.080 --> 45:48.080
All right?

45:48.160 --> 45:49.560
MICHAEL: School football
was pass and move.

45:49.640 --> 45:52.360
Boy's league was...

45:53.120 --> 45:55.680
-Kick, rush and threaten everybody.
-Brian Marwood.

45:55.760 --> 45:56.880
That's two.

45:56.960 --> 45:58.000
JOE: What position?

45:58.080 --> 46:00.960
-Outside right.
-(LAUGHS) Outside right my arse.

46:01.040 --> 46:02.880
JOE: You were too slow
to play wide right.

46:02.960 --> 46:04.680
MICHAEL: My pace was deceptive, mate.

46:04.920 --> 46:06.160
JOE: Yeah, you were slower
than you looked.

46:06.240 --> 46:07.480
Slower than a week in the nick.

46:07.640 --> 46:11.480
I bet there's not a man here
could live with me over 50 yards.

46:11.680 --> 46:12.800
-Yeah, yeah.
-Are you listening?

46:12.880 --> 46:15.360
Not one man here could live with me
over 50 yards.

46:15.760 --> 46:17.200
-Especially you.
-Bollocks.

46:17.480 --> 46:18.720
Curran. Terry Curran.

46:18.800 --> 46:19.960
I once give him ten yards.

46:20.040 --> 46:21.120
I were six year old!

46:21.200 --> 46:24.120
All right then, whoever's man enough,
get outside now.

46:24.200 --> 46:25.240
50 yard sprint.

46:25.320 --> 46:26.360
I can beat you, hopping.

46:26.440 --> 46:28.200
MICHAEL: Aged 50, start from scratch.

46:28.280 --> 46:31.120
Anybody above 50,
one yard for each year. All right?

46:31.200 --> 46:32.560
-JOE: Right!
-Come on then!

46:32.640 --> 46:33.640
Are you men or mouses?

46:33.720 --> 46:34.760
Right...

46:35.000 --> 46:36.040
Taking this with me.

46:36.160 --> 46:37.680
(CHUCKLES)

46:38.080 --> 46:39.440
It's beneath me.

46:42.800 --> 46:44.440
Have you played with me?

46:45.200 --> 46:47.040
Come on, Eddie, don't muck about!

46:47.120 --> 46:49.320
And back to that tree...

46:49.400 --> 46:50.640
JOE: It's pissing down!

46:50.760 --> 46:51.800
EDDIE: It's not all here!

46:51.880 --> 46:54.120
Eddie, man, just start it, will you!

46:54.800 --> 46:56.080
Just start it!

46:56.360 --> 47:00.280
On your marks, get set, go!

47:00.480 --> 47:01.480
(SHOUTING)

47:01.960 --> 47:03.000
Hang on!

47:21.440 --> 47:22.440
(INAUDIBLE)

47:46.200 --> 47:47.240
(SIGHS)

47:49.360 --> 47:50.360
(EXHALES)

47:53.480 --> 47:54.480
(GRUNTS)

48:00.080 --> 48:01.080
Oh.

48:05.920 --> 48:06.960
Hangover?

48:07.160 --> 48:08.200
Yeah.

48:09.120 --> 48:10.760
When was the last time
you had one of them?

48:11.920 --> 48:13.840
Eighth of May, 1979.

48:15.000 --> 48:17.240
Drew 2-2 with Leicester
and got relegated.

48:19.360 --> 48:21.000
You'll be all right for the funeral?

48:22.920 --> 48:24.360
Father Adrian's doing it.

48:25.680 --> 48:26.720
What?

48:27.760 --> 48:28.880
I'm not a priest, Beth.

48:28.960 --> 48:30.000
I'm an imposter.

48:30.080 --> 48:31.640
You're doing it, you prick.

48:32.640 --> 48:34.080
It was her dying wish.

50:56.920 --> 50:57.960
Good morning, all.

50:58.880 --> 51:01.800
I'd like to thank Father Adrian here

51:02.120 --> 51:05.040
for letting me conduct this service
in his church today.

51:06.320 --> 51:08.960
And I'd like to welcome you all.

51:11.920 --> 51:14.920
Especially the, er, Kerrigan clan,

51:15.480 --> 51:18.680
many of whom
haven't been to Mass for years.

51:19.560 --> 51:22.600
So they're probably wondering
whether they can take communion or not.

51:23.320 --> 51:24.360
You can.

51:25.880 --> 51:29.840
I'll give a general absolution
during the service

51:29.920 --> 51:32.320
so there's nothing stopping you.

51:33.720 --> 51:34.800
Please take it.

51:36.360 --> 51:39.120
It would mean so much to me and to Mam.

51:46.240 --> 51:50.000
In the name of the Father and of the Son
and of the Holy Spirit.

51:50.440 --> 51:51.440
ALL: Amen.

51:51.640 --> 51:53.600
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ

51:53.680 --> 51:57.160
and the love of God and the communion
of the Holy Spirit be with you all.

51:58.080 --> 51:59.600
ALL: And with your spirit.

52:01.280 --> 52:04.640
As we prepare to celebrate
the mystery of Christ's love,

52:05.080 --> 52:06.960
let us call to mind our sins.

52:11.240 --> 52:14.320
The times I resented
having to visit our Mam.

52:17.800 --> 52:20.720
The times I did it out of duty
rather than love.

52:22.800 --> 52:24.480
Oh, how that hurts today.

52:27.720 --> 52:29.600
For on the night He was betrayed,

52:31.440 --> 52:32.920
He himself took bread,

52:36.760 --> 52:38.280
and giving you thanks,

52:39.520 --> 52:40.720
He said the blessing,

52:42.320 --> 52:43.560
broke the bread

52:44.640 --> 52:47.320
and gave it to his disciples, saying,

52:48.280 --> 52:51.480
"Take this, all of you,

52:52.760 --> 52:53.920
"and eat of it,

52:55.000 --> 52:56.440
"for this is my body

52:57.160 --> 52:58.680
"which will be given up for you."

52:59.480 --> 53:00.480
(BELL RINGS)

53:09.640 --> 53:10.720
In a similar way,

53:12.280 --> 53:13.480
when supper was ended,

53:16.000 --> 53:17.280
He took the chalice

53:20.640 --> 53:21.880
and giving You thanks,

53:24.560 --> 53:25.680
He said the blessing,

53:28.560 --> 53:33.320
and gave the chalice
to His disciples, saying...

53:35.800 --> 53:39.640
"Take this, all of you,
and drink from it,

53:41.480 --> 53:44.840
"for this is the chalice of my blood,

53:45.800 --> 53:49.160
"the blood of the new
and eternal covenant

53:49.600 --> 53:51.000
"which will be poured out for you

53:51.840 --> 53:54.840
"and for many
for the forgiveness of sins.

53:57.720 --> 54:00.400
"Do this in memory of me."

54:01.280 --> 54:02.280
(BELL RINGS)

54:10.400 --> 54:11.440
The body of Christ.

54:12.760 --> 54:13.800

# Tell me what it's like in heaven

56:57.480 --> 57:01.000
# I hope it's kinder

# With all the trials and tribulations
