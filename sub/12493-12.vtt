00:04.834 --> 00:06.875
Hey, dad, I want to sign up for hockey.

00:08.750 --> 00:11.333
- No, you don't.
- Yeah, I do.

00:11.417 --> 00:13.458
No, you don't! Keep your voice down.

00:13.542 --> 00:15.125
Why? What's wrong with hockey?

00:17.250 --> 00:18.583
Did someone say hockey?

00:20.417 --> 00:21.625
No, no, honey.

00:21.709 --> 00:23.959
I said I was feeling a little...

00:24.041 --> 00:25.625
Stocky.

00:25.709 --> 00:28.208
I heard the word hockey come up
from the air vent.

00:28.291 --> 00:32.291
I asked if I could play hockey
and then dad got all weird.

00:32.375 --> 00:35.875
I have been dreaming of the day
when one of my kids strapped on the skates

00:35.959 --> 00:37.625
and followed in Mama's footsteps.

00:37.709 --> 00:39.333
I feel a story coming on.

00:39.417 --> 00:43.583
I was the star of the Southwest Denver
Community College Lady Icers.

00:45.208 --> 00:47.375
- Even had a cute nickname.
- They called me "Psycho."

00:48.917 --> 00:50.917
Broke the league record
for penalty minutes.

00:51.041 --> 00:53.959
- And that's why they called me--
- Psycho. I got it.

00:55.041 --> 00:56.250
Can I play hockey?

00:56.375 --> 00:57.959
Not only can you play hockey,

00:58.041 --> 01:00.458
I'm gonna teach you
everything I know about the sport.

01:00.542 --> 01:03.709
No, that's okay, Mom.
They actually have coaches.

01:03.792 --> 01:06.417
Coach... I'll be your coach!

01:06.500 --> 01:09.542
- Great idea!
- Coach Psycho.

01:09.625 --> 01:12.000
- Psycho.
- That's right, Charlie.

01:12.125 --> 01:13.583
Mommy's Psycho.

02:12.834 --> 02:14.208
Oh, hey, uh, Derek,

02:14.250 --> 02:15.709
I was wondering if maybe after school

02:15.792 --> 02:18.709
- you wanna go mini-golfing?
- Eh, whatever.

02:19.959 --> 02:22.709
Okay, so, um, is that a whatever like...

02:22.792 --> 02:24.500
"I don't wanna go," or a whatever like

02:24.583 --> 02:26.166
"mini-golf, wow!"?

02:29.166 --> 02:30.375
Whichever.

02:32.083 --> 02:35.667
Okay, okay, so is that
a whichever like "whatever"

02:35.750 --> 02:39.083
or a whichever like "mini-golf, wow!"?

02:41.125 --> 02:43.417
- No worries.
- Whatever.

02:43.834 --> 02:46.333
- 'Kay, see you, babe.
- Terry: Okay.

02:50.250 --> 02:51.959
Ivy, can I ask you something?

02:52.041 --> 02:53.750
- Sure, what's up?
- Well, it's about Derek.

02:53.834 --> 02:55.834
And I want you to be completely honest.

02:57.834 --> 03:00.125
I mean, you know,
we've been going out for a while.

03:00.208 --> 03:02.125
And at first it was fun and everything,

03:02.208 --> 03:04.709
but now I'm kinda wondering
if maybe I should--

03:04.792 --> 03:06.208
Dump his sorry butt!

03:09.458 --> 03:11.834
- Whoa.
- Do it! Now.

03:11.917 --> 03:13.625
He's probably still out there.
I'll go get him.

03:13.709 --> 03:15.458
Whoa, Ivy, Ivy, wait!

03:16.583 --> 03:18.500
I don't mean right now.

03:18.583 --> 03:22.041
I've never broken up with somebody before
and I'm kind of nervous about it.

03:22.125 --> 03:25.333
- There's nothing to be nervous about.
- Well, I, I don't know.

03:25.417 --> 03:26.959
It's easy. Look.

03:27.041 --> 03:29.041
Just pretend I'm Derek
and break up with me.

03:30.792 --> 03:32.792
If it helps, I'll put
a stupid look on my face

03:32.875 --> 03:33.917
and breathe through my mouth.

03:39.625 --> 03:40.917
Teddy: Um...

03:42.834 --> 03:45.750
No, I'm not gonna practice
breaking up with somebody.

03:45.834 --> 03:47.250
I mean, how hard can it be?

03:47.333 --> 03:49.792
I just tell Derek how I feel, nicely,

03:49.875 --> 03:52.291
and then we both go on with our lives.

03:52.375 --> 03:54.750
Whatever.

03:55.959 --> 03:57.500
Okay, could you stop doing that, please?

03:57.583 --> 04:00.166
Ah, I like it.

04:02.375 --> 04:05.542
It's relaxing.
I feel like my brain's on vacation.

04:11.333 --> 04:12.917
Okay, people, listen up.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.083
The geniuses at corporate have come up
with a new menu item.

04:16.166 --> 04:18.583
They are called chicken slivers.

04:18.667 --> 04:20.709
- What's a sliver? Is it like a nugget?
- No.

04:20.792 --> 04:22.417
- Is it like a tender?
- Nope.

04:22.500 --> 04:23.917
Does it have chicken in it?

04:24.000 --> 04:27.917
According to legal,
the answer to that question is "possibly."

04:29.166 --> 04:31.333
And remember,
they're not just chicken slivers,

04:31.417 --> 04:33.750
they are Corporal Kwikki's
chicken slivers,

04:33.834 --> 04:36.875
in honor of our founder,
Corporal Bull S. Kwikki.

04:36.959 --> 04:39.959
- What's he a corporal of?
- Lip-smacking goodness.

04:40.041 --> 04:41.959
Which is also the title
of his autobiography.

04:44.500 --> 04:46.959
Okay, minimum wagers, paychecks.

04:47.041 --> 04:48.458
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

04:49.500 --> 04:52.667
Mitch, aren't we supposed to be
making minimum wage?

04:52.792 --> 04:55.041
It's the law. My dad told me about it.

04:55.125 --> 04:56.625
Never talk to your parents!

04:56.709 --> 04:59.041
Seriously, guys,
what happens here is sacred.

04:59.125 --> 05:00.458
This is a safe place.

05:01.250 --> 05:04.583
Wait a minute. "Minimum" means the least.

05:05.709 --> 05:07.625
We're making less than the least?

05:08.250 --> 05:10.458
Okay, doors opening,

05:10.542 --> 05:12.250
let's feed the world, huh?

05:16.083 --> 05:18.083
Isn't there something
you can do about our salary?

05:18.166 --> 05:20.583
- Why me?
- You're the smartest one here.

05:21.458 --> 05:22.458
I am?

05:23.709 --> 05:26.125
But my foot's in a mop bucket.

05:29.208 --> 05:30.959
Yeah, but you know how to get it out.

05:37.917 --> 05:39.625
I thought we were going to the ice rink.

05:39.709 --> 05:42.583
No. You can't go anywhere near the ice
until you learn the fundamentals.

05:42.667 --> 05:44.542
Sounds boring.

05:44.625 --> 05:46.750
It's not boring. It's fun!

05:46.834 --> 05:49.500
Come on, you can't spell fundamental
without "fun."

05:49.583 --> 05:51.625
You also can't spell it without "mental."

05:52.458 --> 05:55.500
Okay, fundamental number one, positioning.

05:56.542 --> 05:58.917
Why is there a pad on the wall?

06:01.000 --> 06:02.667
Because I believe in safety first.

06:04.625 --> 06:07.250
- What was that?
- That's called checking.

06:07.333 --> 06:08.583
It's not allowed at your level.

06:09.250 --> 06:10.667
Unless the ref doesn't see you.

06:11.500 --> 06:14.500
- Now, you check me.
- No way, you're my mom.

06:14.583 --> 06:16.208
Come on, check me, you little weenie.

06:20.583 --> 06:22.375
That's called avoiding a check.

06:22.458 --> 06:24.208
Get up. Let's practice your skating.

06:25.041 --> 06:28.083
Okay, I will demonstrate.

06:31.208 --> 06:33.250
nice and easy, just like Mama.

06:33.333 --> 06:34.583
Now you try.

06:35.333 --> 06:36.583
Okay.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.875
- Not bad.
- Not bad?

06:40.959 --> 06:43.959
I'd say I'm pretty good.

06:45.542 --> 06:46.875
Never get comfortable.

06:55.250 --> 06:57.125
- Hey, sweetie pie.
- Hey, dad.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.208
Actually I was...

07:01.083 --> 07:02.041
Hey, PJ.

07:03.583 --> 07:06.583
- You okay?
- I got a big problem at work.

07:06.667 --> 07:08.250
I found out my boss is underpaying us

07:08.375 --> 07:10.250
and now the staff wants me
to do something about it.

07:10.375 --> 07:12.417
- Why you?
- I'm the smartest.

07:15.583 --> 07:18.875
Um, how exactly was that determined?

07:19.291 --> 07:21.625
I don't know. Probably a secret vote.

07:22.709 --> 07:24.041
Maybe a raffle.

07:25.750 --> 07:27.208
Uh, well, what are you gonna do?

07:27.959 --> 07:29.250
I don't know. I don't know.

07:29.750 --> 07:31.041
PJ!

07:31.125 --> 07:32.333
You can't go through life

07:32.417 --> 07:34.166
answering every question
with "I don't know."

07:34.250 --> 07:35.458
Really?

07:36.125 --> 07:37.792
I have so far
and I'm a senior in high school.

07:40.458 --> 07:42.125
Probably a raffle.

07:42.208 --> 07:44.125
Um, look.

07:44.208 --> 07:46.834
Son, if you think you deserve more money,

07:46.917 --> 07:48.208
then stand up for yourself.

07:49.041 --> 07:50.750
By the way, your coworkers,

07:50.834 --> 07:53.792
they are counting on you to be strong.

07:57.083 --> 08:00.417
Oh, man, I just found out I'm smart,

08:00.500 --> 08:01.917
and now I have to be strong too?

08:03.417 --> 08:06.000
Enjoy your childhood, Charlie.
It does not last forever.

08:06.959 --> 08:08.083
Cookie?

08:09.500 --> 08:11.333
PJ wuv a cookie.

08:19.041 --> 08:21.291
Okay, okay, okay, he's here.

08:21.333 --> 08:24.333
Oh, Ivy, I don't know if I can do this.

08:24.375 --> 08:26.250
My heart is pounding. Oh, hi, he sees me!

08:26.375 --> 08:29.083
He's waving.
All right, now I'm waving and smiling.

08:30.750 --> 08:33.083
This feels so wrong. Gotta go.

08:34.917 --> 08:36.917
- Hey there, hi, Derek.
- Hey.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.917
Oh, hi, thank you for meeting me.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.291
- Hey, no worries.
- Yeah, uh...

08:42.375 --> 08:46.000
Well, there might be a few.

08:46.083 --> 08:50.166
Listen, I owe you an apology.

08:50.250 --> 08:51.375
For what?

08:51.458 --> 08:53.083
For blowing off
that whole mini-golf thing.

08:53.166 --> 08:55.125
Oh, no, no, no, that's okay.

08:55.208 --> 08:57.625
No! No, it's not. You're my girl.

08:57.709 --> 09:00.417
If you like mini-golf,
I should like mini-golf.

09:01.208 --> 09:04.625
I don't like mini-golf that much.
And speaking of

09:05.375 --> 09:07.625
- not liking things--
- Derek: Wait.

09:07.709 --> 09:11.083
Before you say anything else,
I've got something for you.

09:11.166 --> 09:12.208
Mm-hmm.

09:12.959 --> 09:14.542
Oh.

09:14.625 --> 09:17.125
A leather jacket just like yours.

09:17.208 --> 09:20.417
Yeah, except this one says "D's girl."

09:22.041 --> 09:24.333
Derek: You like it?

09:24.417 --> 09:27.208
What's not to like? I mean, I--

09:27.375 --> 09:30.041
I'm D's girl, now it says so...

09:30.875 --> 09:32.041
On a jacket.

09:34.917 --> 09:38.041
- Yeah, well, try it on.
- Okay.

09:43.417 --> 09:44.959
Wow, awesome.

09:45.583 --> 09:48.458
Now when you're on the back of my bike
everyone will know who you are.

09:50.125 --> 09:51.250
D's girl.

09:57.333 --> 09:59.667
- What's going on?
- Mitch, we need to talk.

10:00.792 --> 10:02.208
You found out what's in the chicken?

10:03.208 --> 10:05.792
- No.
- You found out what we feed the chickens?

10:06.709 --> 10:08.750
- No.
- Is this about the finger in the fingers?

10:10.625 --> 10:11.500
What?

10:11.583 --> 10:14.291
Why don't you tell me what this is about?

10:15.709 --> 10:17.583
- We want a raise.
- A raise?

10:18.458 --> 10:19.959
Okay. Okay.

10:20.041 --> 10:22.709
We can discuss that
at your next salary negotiation

10:22.792 --> 10:26.041
which, um, I believe
is scheduled for the 5th of...

10:26.083 --> 10:27.333
Octembruary.

10:29.667 --> 10:31.500
That's not even a real month!

10:31.625 --> 10:32.834
Right, PJ?

10:33.625 --> 10:35.500
Look, Mitch, what you're doing is wrong

10:35.583 --> 10:37.125
and we're not gonna let you
get away with it.

10:37.208 --> 10:39.834
- We demand a raise!
- Oh, and if I don't give it to you

10:39.917 --> 10:41.125
you're gonna what? Go on strike?

10:41.208 --> 10:43.375
- That's exactly what we'll do.
- You're gonna walk right out?

10:43.458 --> 10:45.333
If that's what striking is, then yes.

10:46.291 --> 10:47.792
All right.

10:47.875 --> 10:49.250
All right.

10:50.041 --> 10:51.000
Come on, guys.

10:52.375 --> 10:53.917
- You'll be sorry.
- No, we won't.

10:54.458 --> 10:57.000
Uh, I'm kinda sorry.

10:57.083 --> 10:58.875
I left my wallet in the break room.

11:01.125 --> 11:03.917
All right, guys, we're on strike.

11:07.208 --> 11:09.083
What do we do now?

11:09.166 --> 11:11.083
Uh...

11:11.166 --> 11:12.125
I don't know.

11:12.208 --> 11:14.083
While we figure out what a strike is,

11:14.166 --> 11:16.375
let's get out of the way
and let the customers in.

11:16.458 --> 11:18.667
- Welcome to Kwikki Chikki.
- Try the slivers!

11:26.709 --> 11:28.208
Mom, Mom, hi.

11:28.291 --> 11:30.291
- Teddy, what are you doing here?
- I need some advice.

11:30.375 --> 11:31.750
Oh, honey, I'm working.

11:31.834 --> 11:34.041
Well, yeah,
but this is about my love life.

11:34.125 --> 11:35.917
Oh, honey,
I think that can wait till tonight.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.333
Woman on P.A.: Nurse Duncan,
patient in 312 needs a sponge bath.

11:43.125 --> 11:45.041
Rhonda, can you handle that?

11:45.125 --> 11:47.625
I'm dealing
with a family crisis right here.

11:48.750 --> 11:50.208
Thank you.

11:51.709 --> 11:53.125
What up, girl?

11:53.542 --> 11:54.875
This is what's up.

11:56.709 --> 11:58.709
"D's Girl"? I thought you were gonna
break up with Derek?

11:58.792 --> 12:01.083
Yeah, I tried,
but then he gave me this jacket

12:01.166 --> 12:02.458
and now I don't know what to do.

12:02.542 --> 12:03.834
Honey, these things are never easy,

12:03.917 --> 12:06.333
but the longer you let it go on
the worse it's gonna be.

12:07.125 --> 12:08.583
Okay, just promise yourself

12:08.709 --> 12:12.041
the very next time you see Derek,
you're gonna break up with him.

12:12.834 --> 12:13.834
Okay.

12:13.917 --> 12:15.834
Okay, okay, the very next time.

12:15.917 --> 12:17.458
- Yes.
- Hey!

12:17.542 --> 12:19.083
Oh, hey, Derek. What? Derek?

12:20.959 --> 12:23.375
- Amy: Oh, my gosh.
- What happened?

12:23.458 --> 12:26.792
Uh, well, I was on my motorcycle

12:26.875 --> 12:29.792
and then I passed that store
that sells teddy bears

12:29.875 --> 12:33.375
and I started thinking of you
'cause, well, you're my Teddy bear.

12:34.834 --> 12:37.250
And then I was in someone's backyard.

12:42.041 --> 12:44.125
Not the very next time.

12:51.291 --> 12:53.208
No bucks, no clucks.

12:53.291 --> 12:55.041
No bucks, no clucks.

12:55.125 --> 12:57.125
No bucks, no clucks.

12:57.208 --> 12:59.208
No bucks, no clucks.

13:01.208 --> 13:02.792
Are you really gonna cross
this picket line?

13:04.000 --> 13:05.291
You're gonna have to go through her.

13:10.542 --> 13:12.333
Yeah!

13:13.333 --> 13:15.792
I say "chikki," you say "icky."

13:15.917 --> 13:16.959
- Chikki!
- Icky!

13:17.041 --> 13:18.166
- Chikki!
- Icky!

13:18.250 --> 13:20.208
How's it going out here, strikers?

13:21.208 --> 13:24.125
So, Mitch,
are you here to meet our demands?

13:24.208 --> 13:26.959
No. I'm here to meet my new employees.

13:27.667 --> 13:29.000
Welcome to Kwikki Chikki.

13:29.667 --> 13:31.250
Let's get started right away, all right?

13:31.333 --> 13:32.667
Don't worry about washing your hands.

13:34.500 --> 13:35.417
What about us?

13:35.500 --> 13:38.000
Oh, good news. You're all fired.

13:38.083 --> 13:39.291
That's not fair.

13:39.375 --> 13:42.083
Tell that to the genius that told you
to go out on strike.

13:44.542 --> 13:46.083
Thanks a lot, PJ.

13:46.750 --> 13:48.959
Wha-- Guys?

13:49.625 --> 13:51.750
This isn't over. Guys, come back!

13:54.125 --> 13:55.959
Well, it looks like
it's just you and me, Charlie.

13:59.667 --> 14:01.041
I don't know where you're going.

14:01.500 --> 14:03.000
I'm your ride!

14:09.875 --> 14:11.625
Mom, come on!

14:15.417 --> 14:17.208
Come on, rookie, let's see what you got.

14:20.875 --> 14:22.208
This is what I got.

14:29.500 --> 14:30.959
Had to play hockey.

14:34.166 --> 14:36.208
Gabe, honey, you're gonna have to do
better than that

14:36.291 --> 14:37.750
if you ever want to set foot on the ice.

14:56.166 --> 14:58.750
Okay, bring it.

15:06.875 --> 15:10.000
Well, Dad, I took your advice,
made a stand.

15:10.083 --> 15:12.458
Hey, good for you. And?

15:13.417 --> 15:14.709
Everyone got fired.

15:15.583 --> 15:17.000
- That's terrible.
- Yeah.

15:17.083 --> 15:19.875
- I know.
- I'm really sorry.

15:19.959 --> 15:23.792
I, I, I can't help feeling kind
of responsible for all this.

15:23.875 --> 15:26.542
Well, you are responsible,
so your feeling is correct.

15:31.458 --> 15:33.375
Look, there's gotta be somebody
you can talk to, right?

15:33.458 --> 15:35.333
- Go over your boss's head.
- To who?

15:35.417 --> 15:39.959
Not even Corporal Bull S. Kwikki
himself could save us now.

15:40.041 --> 15:41.333
The guy in the ads?

15:42.000 --> 15:43.417
He's real?

15:44.542 --> 15:46.166
Yeah, of course, he's real.

15:46.250 --> 15:48.250
And he really has
a horse named "Curly Fry"?

15:49.792 --> 15:51.458
That was a joke in a commercial.

15:52.500 --> 15:53.959
You don't even know your history.

16:04.375 --> 16:05.375
Okay.

16:06.417 --> 16:08.667
- You ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

16:08.750 --> 16:10.250
All right, just get in there,

16:10.375 --> 16:12.625
break his heart and get out.

16:18.834 --> 16:20.333
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:20.417 --> 16:23.625
- Are you gonna sit down?
- Uh, no. No, um...

16:24.500 --> 16:26.792
There's something I want to say.
I'm just gonna say it.

16:28.083 --> 16:32.417
This might be a little tough
because I know you're into me.

16:32.500 --> 16:34.875
You got me that jacket, but, uh,

16:35.333 --> 16:36.500
the thing is...

16:38.083 --> 16:39.166
I think we should break up.

16:41.875 --> 16:42.959
Uh...

16:44.125 --> 16:45.041
Okay.

16:46.417 --> 16:47.500
Okay?

16:48.792 --> 16:51.166
Yeah, I mean, if, if it's what you want.

16:51.250 --> 16:52.709
Yeah, no, that's what I want.

16:54.417 --> 16:55.375
No worries.

16:57.542 --> 16:59.041
Great.

16:59.125 --> 17:01.000
Okay, well...

17:03.041 --> 17:05.250
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

17:11.583 --> 17:13.959
Okay, sorry, quick question.

17:14.041 --> 17:17.375
You're taking this really well.
Why is that?

17:17.458 --> 17:20.417
I mean, well, if it's not working--

17:20.500 --> 17:24.375
It wasn't working for me,
but it was working for you, right?

17:24.500 --> 17:27.375
Sure. Whatever.

17:27.375 --> 17:29.667
Cool. Goodbye.

17:31.000 --> 17:31.917
Again.

17:37.083 --> 17:38.625
Okay, I'm sorry.

17:40.542 --> 17:42.041
I'm breaking your heart here.

17:42.125 --> 17:44.750
The polite response would be
to show a little bit of emotion!

17:47.125 --> 17:50.625
- Hey, how are we doing over here?
- Not so great!

17:51.041 --> 17:53.667
I just broke up with Derek
and he's taking it really well.

17:55.625 --> 17:58.375
- But that's good, right?
- No!

17:58.458 --> 18:00.458
No, no, I want him to be devastated.

18:00.542 --> 18:02.125
Why aren't you devastated?

18:05.959 --> 18:07.500
Teddy, people are staring.

18:07.583 --> 18:08.834
Oh, ho, ho,

18:08.917 --> 18:10.625
so I'm embarrassing you?

18:11.208 --> 18:14.625
No, no, you're supposed to be
embarrassing me, fella.

18:15.333 --> 18:17.667
- Whoa, whoa!
- First breakup, people.

18:17.750 --> 18:19.750
Oh, no, this breakup's not over!

18:19.834 --> 18:21.333
I'm calling you later!

18:27.875 --> 18:29.417
Here is your last check.

18:31.125 --> 18:32.417
Do not stay in touch.

18:34.041 --> 18:35.458
I never liked you.

18:38.208 --> 18:40.166
Atten-hut!

18:41.250 --> 18:44.500
Corporal Bull S. Kwikki is in the corral.

18:44.583 --> 18:46.750
- What are you doing here?
- Excuse me, pardner.

18:48.792 --> 18:54.041
I heard there was some feuding
going on down here at franchise 157.

18:55.083 --> 18:56.542
Labor dispute.

18:59.834 --> 19:01.250
May I say, Corporal,

19:01.375 --> 19:05.667
um, you look somewhat bigger in person.

19:06.208 --> 19:07.750
Uh, yes.

19:07.834 --> 19:10.667
Well, the promotional department

19:10.750 --> 19:12.625
thinks I'm more relatable to the peoples

19:12.709 --> 19:14.542
when I'm all shrunk down like that.

19:16.083 --> 19:18.333
Let me ask you, Corporal,

19:18.417 --> 19:20.792
where exactly did you come from?

19:20.875 --> 19:23.583
Oh, out yonder.

19:25.250 --> 19:29.500
And exactly which state is yonder in?

19:29.583 --> 19:32.750
Sir, that would be
the great state of, uh...

19:34.500 --> 19:35.709
Alabama?

19:36.667 --> 19:37.500
Wrong!

19:37.583 --> 19:41.333
Everyone knows Corporal Bull S. Kwikki
is from New Jersey.

19:42.208 --> 19:45.166
- Ow.
- Who is this imposter?

19:45.250 --> 19:46.208
Okay, I can explain.

19:46.250 --> 19:49.458
What in tarnation is going on in here?

19:50.583 --> 19:52.875
I don't believe it!
This is the real Corporal Kwikki!

19:52.959 --> 19:55.875
Come on, how stupid do you think I am?

19:55.959 --> 19:59.208
I did not come all the way
from the great state of New Jersey

19:59.291 --> 20:01.375
to have my beard yanked by a troll.

20:02.625 --> 20:04.166
Oh, my goodness, it really is you.

20:04.250 --> 20:05.709
Corporal Kwikki, it's an honor, sir.

20:05.792 --> 20:07.291
Quit flapping your gums, boy,

20:07.375 --> 20:09.291
and give these kids their jobs back.

20:09.417 --> 20:12.750
And pay us what we deserve, minimum wage!

20:12.834 --> 20:14.333
Done and done.

20:14.375 --> 20:16.542
Now go wrassle me up some curly fries.

20:16.625 --> 20:19.834
I got a powerful hunger
that can only be satisfied

20:19.917 --> 20:22.166
by the curliest of fries.

20:24.208 --> 20:25.959
How did I do, PJ? Was it...

20:26.041 --> 20:28.208
Mr. Kern, that was awesome.
Thank you so much.

20:28.250 --> 20:29.166
Wait a minute.

20:29.250 --> 20:31.375
- Mr. Kern, your shop teacher?
- Yeah.

20:31.458 --> 20:34.166
I'm trying to become the drama teacher.
How do you think I did?

20:34.250 --> 20:36.625
- 'Cause I think I nailed it.
- Oh, it was awesome.

20:37.834 --> 20:40.166
Howdy, y'all. Bull S. Kwikki here.

20:43.959 --> 20:45.333
Dad, you're late.

20:45.417 --> 20:46.709
We got it covered.

20:47.500 --> 20:50.083
For crying out loud!
I took off work for this?

20:57.583 --> 21:00.166
Hey, Charlie, listen,
don't have a lot of time.

21:00.250 --> 21:02.417
Gotta go meet Derek.
We're still breaking up.

21:04.125 --> 21:05.917
Yeah, yeah, you know,

21:06.000 --> 21:07.750
we'll just, we'll continue to break up

21:07.834 --> 21:10.166
until he gets it right.

21:13.500 --> 21:16.500
Mom, let's go.
We're gonna be late for my game.

21:16.583 --> 21:19.709

Thorry.

21:38.667 --> 21:40.542
Hey, don't you thath me, mister.

21:42.542 --> 21:44.583
Well, in this house

21:44.667 --> 21:45.959

21:46.542 --> 21:48.250
Hey, don't you thtart!

21:49.917 --> 21:51.375
Good luck, Charlie.

21:56.000 --> 21:59.917
Aw, I declare,
she is cuter than a duck's butt.

22:02.417 --> 22:05.250
Well, I hope you boys is hungry.

22:05.375 --> 22:07.458
The missus is rustling up some grub.

22:07.542 --> 22:09.750
Anything but chicken, son.

22:09.834 --> 22:12.792
Well played, sir. Well played.

22:13.959 --> 22:16.208
Well, while we're waiting,
how about a song?

22:16.291 --> 22:17.917
Well, that's a fine idea.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.875
Do you know any Lady Gaga?

22:21.208 --> 22:22.792
