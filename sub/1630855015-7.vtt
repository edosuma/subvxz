WEBVTT

00:09.928 --> 00:11.345
Okay, hold on, hold on.

00:15.265 --> 00:16.225
Nice.

00:23.607 --> 00:28.738
Rasmussen!

00:30.198 --> 00:32.951
- Hey, Tom.
- Hi.

00:32.951 --> 00:34.995
- Just put it there.
- Okay.

00:36.161 --> 00:38.498
So it's election eve,

00:38.997 --> 00:42.459
and guess what Father Sexmas
has brought you?

00:42.459 --> 00:45.463
Why, hot fresh polling.

00:46.672 --> 00:49.551
Yeah.
Jimenez up by four.

00:49.551 --> 00:51.468
Jesus. How are you gonna play?

00:51.468 --> 00:53.013
I guess, I don't know.

00:53.554 --> 00:58.434
Amplify to gin up our maniacs
or deny, shit on and bury, I guess.

01:00.645 --> 01:02.105
- Matsson.
- What does he want?

01:03.689 --> 01:05.859
He thinks the Living Plus stock bump
is fading

01:05.859 --> 01:07.777
and he wants to know what
my brothers have cooking.

01:07.777 --> 01:10.279
- Is he coming?
- To the party? No.

01:10.279 --> 01:11.823
No, he doesn't want
to swim around

01:11.823 --> 01:16.618
my dad's "bullshit pre-election
brain dead AOL-era legacy media"

01:16.618 --> 01:18.747
"putrid stuffed-mushroom fuck fest".

01:19.580 --> 01:21.416
I thought it was gonna be fun.

01:24.419 --> 01:31.300
So this is just a little party prezzie
for being such a hot piece of ass.

01:31.300 --> 01:33.886
- Thank you.
- Such a foxy little minx.

01:34.553 --> 01:38.933
And just to say that I'm really glad
that we're hosting this party together.

01:39.809 --> 01:43.270
And we can say to people that
we had a little break

01:43.645 --> 01:45.774
and then we're back.

01:46.316 --> 01:48.192
Yeah, I like that.

01:55.282 --> 01:57.117
- What?
- Yeah.

01:59.203 --> 02:01.039
A scorpion.

02:02.581 --> 02:06.293
- Because?
- Because it's funny.

02:07.837 --> 02:10.298
Because why?

02:11.507 --> 02:13.759
Because it's like, it's a joke.

02:13.759 --> 02:15.011
Who's the scorpion?

02:16.762 --> 02:18.555
You, I guess.

02:19.224 --> 02:22.936
But it's just silly, honey.
It's like, you know, I love you,

02:22.936 --> 02:25.313
but you kill me and I kill you.

02:26.940 --> 02:29.983
Okay, yeah, right.
Yeah, I get it.

02:31.236 --> 02:33.071
- I like it.
- Good.

02:35.281 --> 02:37.282
Well, you gotta get to work.

02:37.282 --> 02:39.702
You gotta go contribute
to the great toxification.

02:39.702 --> 02:41.036
Gotta do my part.

02:55.175 --> 02:57.512
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:01.849 --> 03:04.685
Are you okay?
How's everyone?

03:04.685 --> 03:06.228
No, I'm fine. We're all fine.

03:06.228 --> 03:08.856
And you know, this is fine,
but if it's legal stuff,

03:08.856 --> 03:10.775
I really need to keep my head
out of that right now.

03:10.775 --> 03:14.321
No, I will just keep this brief.

03:16.406 --> 03:18.616
Sophie doesn't wanna go to school.

03:18.616 --> 03:21.994
She is freaked out about the election.

03:22.870 --> 03:25.332
What do you mean?
What, is she okay?

03:25.332 --> 03:26.958
She's okay.

03:27.916 --> 03:30.627
All right, so this weekend,

03:30.627 --> 03:37.719
someone kind of felt pushed by her
a little on the street.

03:38.510 --> 03:42.723
But there was a comment that
she felt came from the...

03:43.224 --> 03:45.225
The guy had on a Ravenhead shirt.

03:45.225 --> 03:46.977
There was a quote
on the shirt

03:46.977 --> 03:52.358
and she felt it was racially tinged
and she's been upset.

03:52.776 --> 03:55.111
- What did they say?
- I don't know.

03:55.612 --> 04:00.325
And now at school, some kids have
started this whole anti-ATN thing,

04:00.325 --> 04:02.410
which is actually very supportive.

04:02.410 --> 04:06.372
But it's complex for her.

04:06.830 --> 04:09.917
Who was with her?
Why was she out on the street?

04:09.917 --> 04:12.295
Did you just ask me
why she was on the street?

04:12.295 --> 04:14.923
You're telling me someone pushed
our daughter or whatever ?

04:14.923 --> 04:17.509
Pushed by her,
she was with her friends.

04:17.509 --> 04:19.260
- Where was I?
- Yeah.

04:19.594 --> 04:21.720
- Are you fucking serious?
- I'm not blaming you.

04:21.720 --> 04:24.431
I'm trying to get all the information
before I make a decision

04:24.431 --> 04:25.684
on our course of action.

04:25.684 --> 04:28.436
You need to make a decision
if you're gonna call your daughter?

04:28.436 --> 04:30.104
I was raising our daughter

04:30.104 --> 04:32.857
while you were fucking running
a racist news organization.

04:32.857 --> 04:34.567
- Great, fuck you. Come on!
- Fuck me?

04:34.567 --> 04:36.610
How fucking dare you interrogate me?

04:36.610 --> 04:38.154
Obviously I feel bad.

04:38.154 --> 04:41.240
Obviously I will do anything
to protect her. Anything.

04:41.240 --> 04:45.160
Okay, I'm gonna just...
We'll cope.

04:46.413 --> 04:48.997
And I don't know, just maybe
call your fucking daughter.

04:48.997 --> 04:51.291
Well, obviously.
Jesus, Rava, Jesus!

04:51.291 --> 04:53.586
What kind of parent
do you think I am?

04:53.586 --> 04:56.840
You know, you have no idea the things
I'm doing, the things I'm working on.

04:56.840 --> 04:58.632
Six continents, okay?

04:58.632 --> 05:01.011
I'm breaking my back,
and it's all for them.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.555
To make the world safe.

06:35.313 --> 06:39.567
Yeah, great, dig on that,
dig to heck on that. Dig, dig!

06:42.028 --> 06:43.570
Yeah, no, we love the deal.

06:43.570 --> 06:46.658
We just have to make sure we
know everything on Matsson and GoJo.

06:46.658 --> 06:50.285
I mean, there's due diligence,
but this is undue diligence,

06:50.285 --> 06:52.037
extra diligence, okay?

06:53.205 --> 06:56.001
Okay, great,
and get that dirt on Matsson.

06:56.001 --> 06:57.419
Anything could be useful.

06:57.419 --> 07:01.464
Apparently, insignificant details
could be very useful to me, to us.

07:01.965 --> 07:03.257
What?

07:03.925 --> 07:05.760
No, you're a fucking deputy rat fucker.

07:05.760 --> 07:09.264
Don't object to being a rat fucker,
Tomas, it's unbecoming.

07:09.597 --> 07:11.558
Hey, honey. Bise?

07:14.393 --> 07:16.145
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

07:16.145 --> 07:18.564
- Hi.
- Hey, how you doing?

07:18.564 --> 07:20.150
Good.

07:21.026 --> 07:22.777
I just came from seeing Pop.

07:23.111 --> 07:25.154
- Again?
- Yeah.

07:25.154 --> 07:26.655
Any change?

07:27.073 --> 07:30.785
Looking good. Woke up on
the right side of the coffin today, boy.

07:31.910 --> 07:34.079
What? I like to go. You should go.

07:34.079 --> 07:37.292
And do what, sit there
like I'm feeding the ducks?

07:38.000 --> 07:39.752
Thank you for ignoring me.

07:39.752 --> 07:44.132
The weird thing, honestly,
is how much he's not there.

07:46.592 --> 07:47.927
I find that consoling.

07:48.427 --> 07:51.597
Well, here he is.
Kendall Plus.

07:51.597 --> 07:53.058
- Morning, sorry I'm late.
- Hey.

07:53.058 --> 07:56.478
The man who's gonna lead us
to eternal life, Waystar Jesus.

07:58.896 --> 08:00.022
You seen the polling today?

08:00.856 --> 08:03.025
That's why you're all perky.
Very exciting.

08:03.025 --> 08:05.944
I'm sure your Red Guards
are all ready to come round up

08:05.944 --> 08:09.032
the thought criminals and turn police
stations into cuddle puddles.

08:09.032 --> 08:12.659
The exciting part is in the top line.
In Alaska, I'm exploding.

08:13.078 --> 08:15.372
Four, five, six percent.

08:15.372 --> 08:19.584
Guys, can we do this?
I have a lot going on today.

08:19.584 --> 08:21.126
- Sure.
- Very well.

08:22.671 --> 08:25.881
I hereby convene this funeral
management committee.

08:25.881 --> 08:30.302
I've sent the materials and I assume
you've familiarized yourselves.

08:30.302 --> 08:31.762
Because I'm concerned.

08:32.346 --> 08:36.308
We're saying yes to all Marcia's
wishes, then all your ideas,

08:36.308 --> 08:37.894
Pop's requirements.

08:37.894 --> 08:40.688
Danger the funeral could turn
into a three day grief-a-thon.

08:40.688 --> 08:42.857
- Just fuck Marcia.
- Seconded.

08:42.857 --> 08:43.984
Great. Carried.

08:43.984 --> 08:46.819
Nevertheless,
we really want a tight 90.

08:46.819 --> 08:50.197
And the central question is,
who's gonna speak?

08:50.572 --> 08:53.701
What, in front of the most powerful
political and cultural

08:53.701 --> 08:55.661
business interests in the world?

08:58.038 --> 09:01.834
I'm easy.
Right, I can speak about dad.

09:01.834 --> 09:04.587
What, your usual
malign influence material?

09:06.840 --> 09:08.800
I could do it.

09:08.800 --> 09:12.429
I think if any one of us actually
wants to do it,

09:12.429 --> 09:14.555
do the big number,
then we should just say,

09:14.555 --> 09:17.934
because probably no one minds, right?
No? Yeah.

09:21.103 --> 09:23.523
Okay. Will you have a think?

09:24.065 --> 09:26.234
I'm jumping on the digital battle bus.

09:26.609 --> 09:30.237
Tailgate party, we nail it down, yeah?
Okay, sure, bye-bye.

09:30.237 --> 09:31.698
- All right, good luck.
- Bye.

09:35.451 --> 09:36.536
Right.

09:37.203 --> 09:41.665
So Shiv, one thing
from us on the tailgate.

09:41.665 --> 09:46.171
We were actually wondering about us,
politically inviting Nate.

09:46.628 --> 09:48.589
Nate? Sofrelli?

09:51.091 --> 09:52.344
Okay.

09:54.012 --> 09:57.807
Tom and I kind of had hoped that...
Why?

09:59.100 --> 10:01.393
Because it went so well in LA,
you know?

10:01.393 --> 10:03.354
Hats off to the greatest showman here.

10:03.354 --> 10:07.733
Apologies on the old wibble wobble
and all due congratulations, but...

10:07.733 --> 10:11.028
So you wanna make sure
we have a plan B

10:11.028 --> 10:13.739
in case we can't chase Matsson
out of town on price.

10:13.739 --> 10:16.201
Exactly, and we think that's regulatory.

10:16.201 --> 10:20.162
We go hard, regulatory,
DOJ, FTC, FCC, EU.

10:21.330 --> 10:22.373
No?

10:22.373 --> 10:24.125
I think they might just stop it.

10:24.125 --> 10:27.796
But even just the threat creates
a ton more risk for Matsson,

10:27.796 --> 10:29.546
kicks the deal down the line, right?

10:29.546 --> 10:32.342
And Nate...
He's across competition

10:32.342 --> 10:35.178
and he's tight with the Jimenez
folks on that.

10:35.178 --> 10:36.303
Can we get him down?

10:36.303 --> 10:40.433
So we can sell it on a real level
without lobbyists and all the...

10:40.433 --> 10:42.017
Due process?

10:43.019 --> 10:44.980
- That stuff.
- Yeah.

10:46.940 --> 10:49.275
- Yeah, sure, fine.
- Good.

10:50.026 --> 10:52.278
- All right, see you tonight.
- See you tonight.

10:59.785 --> 11:02.205
- Good, yeah?
- Yeah, good, I think so. What else?

11:02.913 --> 11:07.127
How you feeling about the blowback
from the firings, the bloodlust?

11:07.127 --> 11:09.754
- You want to throw Hugo at that?
- Fuck it, let's own it.

11:12.757 --> 11:13.841
Hey.

11:14.508 --> 11:18.679
Hey, Lukas. Yeah, listen,
so they're gonna go regulatory.

11:19.680 --> 11:22.474
Yeah, so you need to be there tonight.

11:23.851 --> 11:29.231
Well, no, it'll be easy,
just my dad invited you.

11:31.109 --> 11:36.448
Yes, there's gonna be what,
40 thought leaders,

11:36.448 --> 11:39.908
pols, officials who will actually
decide this

11:39.908 --> 11:42.911
and half of them are gonna be there.
Okay?

11:42.911 --> 11:46.665
So I am telling you that you need
to be there too, to counter.

12:09.355 --> 12:11.440
Sorry if I broke your dick last night.

12:11.440 --> 12:13.776
Nope, still rock hard.

12:18.281 --> 12:22.869
So, there's no easy way of doing this.

12:22.869 --> 12:25.580
I've done this a couple of times
this week and sometimes honestly,

12:25.580 --> 12:27.040
it just makes me cry.

12:27.873 --> 12:31.502
But I wanted to offer my heartfelt
appreciation to you all.

12:32.169 --> 12:35.422
And now I'm gonna hand over
to my colleague, Gregory Hirsch,

12:35.422 --> 12:37.342
who has more information.

12:38.967 --> 12:41.471
Thank you, sir.
Good morning.

12:51.940 --> 12:53.190
Good morning.

12:53.190 --> 12:55.359
I'm here to inform you
that Waystar Royco

12:55.359 --> 12:58.237
has been looking at a range
of different options

12:58.237 --> 13:02.450
in order to drastically reduce costs
and a very difficult decision

13:02.450 --> 13:06.203
to restructure the ATN
operation internationally

13:06.788 --> 13:10.999
has been taken in order to protect
the future of the business.

13:11.751 --> 13:15.045
This action was only taken
after seriously considering

13:15.045 --> 13:17.548
all available options.

13:17.548 --> 13:19.883
But if you're on this call,
this is confirmation

13:19.883 --> 13:21.969
that you are part of the unlucky group

13:21.969 --> 13:25.222
who are having their contract terminated
with immediate effect

13:25.222 --> 13:27.475
on the grounds of staffing redundancy

13:27.475 --> 13:30.811
and today is your final day
of employment.

13:32.646 --> 13:34.566
Final day of employment...

13:35.358 --> 13:37.777
Going forward, we intend to operate

13:37.777 --> 13:41.072
Waystar Royco international
newsgathering operations utilizing

13:41.072 --> 13:43.950
third party contract
based arrangements.

13:47.704 --> 13:50.247
I'm seeing some confusion in the chat.

13:52.207 --> 13:55.920
But yes, if I have been too wordy, yes,

13:56.588 --> 13:58.256
we are letting all of you go.

14:01.091 --> 14:03.302
Obviously, I can't take questions
on this call,

14:03.302 --> 14:06.222
but this is a very sad day.

14:06.930 --> 14:11.061
And I thank you for your time today
and your service to Waystar Royco.

14:11.643 --> 14:13.021
Goodbye.

14:14.564 --> 14:15.857
Nice, done.

14:19.693 --> 14:22.946
So this German one with this label,
let's push this, okay?

14:22.946 --> 14:27.368
Say it's a light, fruity red.
Don't say it's biodynamic.

14:27.368 --> 14:29.870
Don't say it's German.
Just say it's a light, fruity red.

14:29.870 --> 14:33.665
And yes, a little bit of fizz is
normal and sophisticated, okay?

14:34.376 --> 14:35.709
Hey.

14:36.586 --> 14:38.672
It's okay, what's going on?
Wakey wakey.

14:38.672 --> 14:42.217
I'm just, I'm fine.
I'm tired.

14:42.217 --> 14:44.177
Election eve, it's a lot.

14:44.177 --> 14:47.096
- Yeah.
- It turns out, I'm pre-tired.

14:47.096 --> 14:50.558
I'm tired about thinking
how tired I'm gonna be.

14:50.558 --> 14:54.645
Because someone isn't letting
someone get a lot of sleep.

14:54.645 --> 14:56.648
Well, forgive me.

14:56.648 --> 14:59.818
So we got a couple of extra names
for the guest list.

15:00.276 --> 15:02.362
Matsson is in fact coming now.

15:02.362 --> 15:03.612
Because?

15:03.612 --> 15:06.199
Because Dumb and Dumber
are trying to spook the deal

15:06.199 --> 15:09.743
and want to try doing
regulatory shit angle

15:09.743 --> 15:11.995
and he's gonna come
and head that off.

15:11.995 --> 15:14.039
That's good for me, right?

15:14.039 --> 15:16.166
I have my chance to dance,
I can secure my spot.

15:16.166 --> 15:19.294
Post Roypocalypse. Right?

15:20.630 --> 15:25.384
Also, to push that agenda,
they wanted to invite Nate.

15:25.384 --> 15:29.472
And I feel like I had a tactical way
to say no, they want to invite Nate.

15:33.143 --> 15:38.188
He's key on tech and trade for Gil
and Jimenez.

15:39.149 --> 15:42.027
I'm sorry, it's not...

15:42.609 --> 15:45.905
And I am genuinely sorry, really.

15:46.823 --> 15:48.783
Sure, Nate.

15:49.658 --> 15:53.121
It'll be good to see Nate.
What do I care?

15:55.998 --> 15:57.875
- It's okay.
- Thanks, honey.

16:37.373 --> 16:40.669
Okay, you guys ready to spread
some regulatory anxieties?

16:40.669 --> 16:43.797
Yeah, sure, spread those
surveillance capitalism heebie-jeebies.

16:44.214 --> 16:46.715
Just don't let me get stuck
with the Journal op-ed ogres.

16:46.715 --> 16:49.427
They're not all crypto-fascist
and right-wing nut jobs.

16:49.427 --> 16:50.971
We also have some
venture capital dems

16:50.971 --> 16:54.390
and centrist ghouls,
dad's ideological range was wide.

16:55.392 --> 16:57.309
- Should we hit it?
- Yeah, let's hit it.

16:57.309 --> 16:58.895
All right.

16:58.895 --> 17:01.773
Hey, what's up?
Not your guys' poll numbers.

17:03.900 --> 17:06.111
- Are you tired?
- No.

17:06.111 --> 17:07.529
Maybe a little.

17:08.571 --> 17:10.322
Maybe drink a coffee.

17:10.322 --> 17:12.993
If I drink a coffee,
then I won't be able to sleep later.

17:12.993 --> 17:14.661
Think, Greg!

17:16.663 --> 17:20.624
So, anyway, listen,
Matsson is coming.

17:20.624 --> 17:23.335
So, that is gonna be my focus.

17:23.335 --> 17:28.424
And you, unless you are truly aligning
yourself to the Dumpster brothers,

17:28.424 --> 17:30.134
you might want
to sweeten that beat too.

17:30.134 --> 17:33.804
Yeah, I'd love to feather that bed.

17:33.804 --> 17:38.183
But Matsson hates me,
so I think I'm team Ken-Ro.

17:39.893 --> 17:43.231
Up to you, Greg.
Okay, I'm gonna mingle.

17:43.231 --> 17:44.524
Yeah, mingle up.

17:48.903 --> 17:50.362
Okay, okay.

17:50.822 --> 17:54.491
Looks like Shiv's hitting Valerie.
Have you seen Nate?

17:55.034 --> 17:57.245
No, but Mencken's team called.

17:57.911 --> 18:00.373
Okay, because the polling?

18:00.373 --> 18:02.959
Yeah, well, their internals
are even worse.

18:02.959 --> 18:06.671
And they want what,
ATN to go full,

18:06.671 --> 18:08.630
"we're coming to give
your guns hormone therapy,"

18:08.630 --> 18:10.174
"all your guns
are gonna be ladies"?

18:10.174 --> 18:14.471
Three or four states where
Connor's 1% are throwing things

18:14.471 --> 18:16.680
could be pivotal.

18:16.680 --> 18:19.808
If he were to drop out,
most of the support would go to them,

18:19.808 --> 18:24.521
but his team is not, they're
just refusing contact, apparently.

18:24.521 --> 18:27.441
So they've asked if I can convince him
to drop out.

18:28.818 --> 18:31.320
I mean, I don't know.

18:32.530 --> 18:35.157
- Fuck that guy, right?
- Mencken?

18:35.157 --> 18:37.785
Yeah. Victory vans,
those O'Malley fucks.

18:37.785 --> 18:38.953
I think fuck him.

18:38.953 --> 18:43.082
It's not bad for us to be tight with him
in case things swing his way, right?

18:43.540 --> 18:44.709
Yeah, fine, I see you.

18:44.709 --> 18:49.714
All right, I'll hit the libtards,
you go help the Nazis.

18:49.714 --> 18:51.423
The Nazis, you got it.

18:52.300 --> 18:53.885
Wait, excuse me.

18:56.137 --> 18:58.097
- Hey.
- Hey, Tom.

18:58.097 --> 19:00.224
Hello, Nathaniel!

19:01.184 --> 19:02.435
Appreciate the invite.

19:03.102 --> 19:04.771
Well, I've missed you.

19:05.938 --> 19:09.234
Won't be long,
a lot going on, obviously.

19:09.234 --> 19:10.819
Won't drink too much of your wine.

19:10.819 --> 19:13.405
Don't you worry, you gobble
my gravlax, pal,

19:13.405 --> 19:14.822
plenty of where that came from.

19:14.822 --> 19:16.657
It's light and fruity,

19:16.657 --> 19:19.119
and it's the kind of wine
that separates the connoisseurs

19:19.119 --> 19:22.205
from the weekend Malbec morons.

19:22.205 --> 19:24.290
Keep away from this man, tonight.

19:24.290 --> 19:27.876
- Keep away from you.
- Back, back, foul news demon.

19:28.253 --> 19:30.088
Nice to see you, Len.
Good one!

19:30.797 --> 19:32.424
Fucking asshole.

19:32.424 --> 19:34.842
Sorry to interrupt,
can I grab him for a second?

19:34.842 --> 19:37.511
- Yeah.
- What's up?

19:37.511 --> 19:43.852
Just, you know,
kind of a biggie actually.

19:43.852 --> 19:45.478
And a bit last minute.

19:45.478 --> 19:48.523
Mencken's team called. They wanted
to know if you might be willing

19:49.941 --> 19:51.401
to drop out.

19:51.401 --> 19:53.862
- Of the election?
- Yes, of the election.

19:53.862 --> 19:56.780
You are aware that the polls open
in ten hours?

19:56.780 --> 19:59.075
Yes, and it might be too late
to physically remove your name

19:59.075 --> 20:01.911
from the ballots, but if you were
to release a statement,

20:01.911 --> 20:04.748
divert the Conhead stream
to the Mencken river.

20:04.748 --> 20:07.207
And after all the blood and treasure
I've expended,

20:07.207 --> 20:09.711
why on earth would I want to do that?

20:09.711 --> 20:12.839
They said for the good of the republic.

20:14.298 --> 20:15.507
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

20:15.925 --> 20:17.885
Yeah, so, no?

20:18.927 --> 20:20.096
No.

20:20.096 --> 20:24.100
Well, then, I have been authorized
to make a follow-up offer,

20:24.100 --> 20:27.811
which is, how familiar are you
with Mogadishu?

20:27.811 --> 20:30.189
Mogadishu?
In Somalia?

20:30.189 --> 20:32.816
Because they are very impressed
with your talents,

20:32.816 --> 20:37.030
and they think that you'd be a good fit
for an ambassadorial appointment.

20:37.030 --> 20:38.573
A little bit car-bomby.

20:39.782 --> 20:43.328
Hey, tell them UN.
That's more my vibration, yeah?

20:43.328 --> 20:45.496
- Yeah?
- All right. I'll report back.

20:45.496 --> 20:46.915
Thank you.

20:49.793 --> 20:53.254
Hey. How you doing?
Good to see you.

20:53.254 --> 20:56.925
Hey. So, she showed.
That's good.

20:56.925 --> 20:59.469
Guess you smoothed it over,
right, General Franco?

20:59.469 --> 21:01.970
No. She's incredibly angry.

21:02.889 --> 21:06.518
Okay, everybody.
Everybody, welcome, one and all.

21:06.518 --> 21:09.104
- Ken, take it away.
- Thanks, Tom.

21:09.104 --> 21:12.732
Thank you, thank you.
Okay, okay, welcome, everybody.

21:12.732 --> 21:14.317
Welcome, welcome.

21:17.153 --> 21:19.405
Who we got here?

21:19.947 --> 21:21.198
Carly Flight?

21:22.409 --> 21:26.745
Shit! The pod goddess.
Everybody watch out for her.

21:27.830 --> 21:30.165
- Careful what you say.
- That's right.

21:31.042 --> 21:33.502
Larry, Mary,
lovely to see you guys.

21:33.502 --> 21:36.338
Who else is here?
Who's here?

21:36.338 --> 21:39.050
Len.
Len giveth and Len taketh away.

21:39.884 --> 21:41.552
Watch out for Len.

21:41.552 --> 21:43.971
My guy Nate Sofrelli saw
the polls this morning

21:43.971 --> 21:47.726
and moonwalked here.
Our best to Gil and Jimenez.

21:48.350 --> 21:50.978
Everybody's here.
It's great to see you all.

21:51.770 --> 21:56.568
It's our first tailgate party
without the big guy.

21:57.110 --> 22:00.030
Yeah, but we're still
going to live it up.

22:00.030 --> 22:02.866
As always, kettle corn over there
will be shipped

22:02.866 --> 22:05.534
to whoever is closest
to tomorrow's electoral count.

22:06.368 --> 22:09.289
And, yeah, this is a tough one.

22:09.289 --> 22:13.375
But we're all going to stay sane
and we're all going to stay friends.

22:13.375 --> 22:16.045
Yeah?
Thanks to my sis for hosting.

22:16.630 --> 22:18.047
Thank you, sis.

22:20.174 --> 22:24.012
But, yeah, we didn't know
what to do this year.

22:26.638 --> 22:30.226
You know, we watch history.

22:30.893 --> 22:32.436
We make history.

22:32.436 --> 22:35.106
And then one day we become it.

22:36.106 --> 22:40.070
So I'd like to ask you all
for a moment of silence

22:40.070 --> 22:42.613
if we could, in memory.

23:01.632 --> 23:03.301
Thank you.

23:03.717 --> 23:05.844
- Sorry.
- That's okay.

23:05.844 --> 23:08.180
Hey, man.
So VIP in the house.

23:09.431 --> 23:11.517
Mr. Matsson, how are you?
Welcome!

23:11.517 --> 23:13.394
Thank you.
Thank you, everyone.

23:13.394 --> 23:17.523
You don't get my sister's triplex
in the deal, don't get greedy.

23:17.523 --> 23:21.694
Well, you know, we haven't closed
yet, so we'll see what happens.

23:21.694 --> 23:23.487
Anyway, welcome.

23:23.487 --> 23:28.034
You know, my dad loved you all.
We love you all.

23:28.034 --> 23:30.662
So let's have some fun.
Let the games begin.

23:31.246 --> 23:33.122
Salud. Cheers.

23:37.876 --> 23:40.212
Okay.
What the fuck is he doing here?

23:40.839 --> 23:43.382
Yeah, I don't know. Seriously.
It's like, what the fuck?

23:43.382 --> 23:48.346
So apparently, Dad invited him, actually,

23:48.346 --> 23:50.681
and he emailed a yes, like,
four minutes before walking in.

23:50.681 --> 23:53.393
Four?
Do we just throw him out, then?

23:53.393 --> 23:55.770
I would love that, no, but I don't
think we can afford to be seen

23:55.770 --> 23:57.063
treating him as the enemy.

23:57.063 --> 23:59.149
I think we hang tough, yeah?

23:59.732 --> 24:02.401
Just stick to the plan, regulatory.

24:02.401 --> 24:05.071
These assholes in here,
our assholes.

24:05.071 --> 24:06.948
Yeah, but what's this fucking game?

24:06.948 --> 24:09.908
Like, is he going for freakout,
or is he flicking the same beans as us?

24:09.908 --> 24:11.911
Well, how do you want to play?

24:11.911 --> 24:14.998
Honestly, there's too much
peanut butter between us.

24:14.998 --> 24:16.833
Can you stick close?

24:18.084 --> 24:19.793
Yeah, sure.

24:19.793 --> 24:22.171
I think just guide him away from
the high-value targets,

24:22.171 --> 24:24.341
refill his glass,
run him in circles,

24:24.341 --> 24:26.050
tell people he's Looney Tunes
behind his back,

24:26.050 --> 24:27.469
keep him from the big wigs.

24:27.469 --> 24:29.720
So, Operation, just,
like, Nuke the Luke?

24:29.720 --> 24:31.764
- Yeah.
- All right. I can do that.

24:31.764 --> 24:34.099
- Let's do it.
- Let's smash that Swede.

24:34.099 --> 24:37.187
I'm tired. It's a lot,
pre-election crap.

24:37.187 --> 24:39.439
- Yeah, I bet, I bet.
- Yeah, it's a lot.

24:39.439 --> 24:43.484
So are you in the company,
are you hands-on

24:43.484 --> 24:45.402
or more of an overview guy?

24:47.738 --> 24:50.909
Interesting. I guess,
let me ask you this.

24:50.909 --> 24:54.037
What would you value more highly?

24:54.037 --> 24:55.914
- Really?
- No.

24:55.914 --> 24:57.540
Because I like to think
that I could do both,

24:57.540 --> 24:59.876
you know, I'd get my hands dirty
and clean noggin.

24:59.876 --> 25:03.713
- You know, multi tasker.
- Okay. You're kissing my ass.

25:04.047 --> 25:06.675
No, I'm not kissing your ass, Lukas.

25:06.675 --> 25:09.301
You're too smart.
You'd spot it a mile off.

25:09.301 --> 25:10.720
- Hey.
- Hey.

25:10.720 --> 25:12.847
I'm about to take a shit
in your husband's mouth

25:12.847 --> 25:15.057
and I'm pretty sure he's going
to tell me it tastes like coconut.

25:15.057 --> 25:16.309
No, no, I'm not.

25:17.018 --> 25:19.938
No, but seriously,
it's a really, really nice place.

25:19.938 --> 25:21.147
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

25:21.147 --> 25:23.024
Who'll get to keep it in the divorce?

25:28.946 --> 25:31.782
Okay, should we hit up some people?

25:31.782 --> 25:33.451
- Good to see you.
- Talk to you later.

25:34.410 --> 25:36.871
- It's good to see you.
- Yeah, yeah. You too, Gary.

25:37.914 --> 25:42.251
You need to hit Nate, Carly,
Valerie first,

25:42.251 --> 25:44.586
but I need to keep an eye out
for my brothers.

25:44.586 --> 25:47.841
You just need...
You've done this before,

25:47.841 --> 25:49.634
so just don't...

25:50.009 --> 25:52.094
Don't what?

25:52.094 --> 25:54.930
Don't scream "people are data"
and stick my dick in the guac?

25:54.930 --> 25:57.599
- Yeah, sure.
- Don't do that.

25:57.599 --> 26:00.061
Yeah, you're about to purchase one
of the most prized cultural assets

26:00.061 --> 26:02.355
and political communication channels
in America

26:02.355 --> 26:04.106
and you need to prepare the ground

26:04.106 --> 26:07.027
because otherwise your many fucking
enemies will portray you

26:07.027 --> 26:09.738
as some jerk-off coder
from Gothenburg. Okay ?

26:09.738 --> 26:12.073
I am a jerkoff coder from Gothenburg.

26:12.615 --> 26:14.992
Right, Ebba?
You remember Ebba?

26:14.992 --> 26:17.495
Hi, yeah, good to see you again.
How are you?

26:17.911 --> 26:20.081
I'm, you know, who cares?

26:20.081 --> 26:22.417
Who cares? Yeah. Charming.

26:22.417 --> 26:26.087
Well, not that you need to do
anything about this now,

26:26.087 --> 26:28.589
but you should fire your lobbyists,
just so you know.

26:28.589 --> 26:30.508
You need rainmakers
and not weather forecasters.

26:30.508 --> 26:35.555
Sure, it's just not really my arena.
I'm sorry. It's more Andreas.

26:35.555 --> 26:37.599
You don't have to apologize, Ebba.

26:37.599 --> 26:40.017
It's just information we're sharing.

26:41.519 --> 26:45.649
It's social anxiety.
She's the only PR person in the world

26:45.649 --> 26:47.233
who hates talking to people.

26:48.068 --> 26:51.278
Yeah. I don't love parties,
but I'm good.

26:52.321 --> 26:55.199
Whereas I love them. I do.

26:56.368 --> 26:57.911
Skal!

26:58.662 --> 27:02.706
So I have a number two who's
moon-beamed on edibles

27:02.706 --> 27:05.334
and a communication officer
who's terrified of communicating.

27:06.461 --> 27:07.587
Brilliant.

27:07.587 --> 27:12.050
So, Mogadishu's a no-go.
It's a death sentence.

27:12.509 --> 27:14.259
Frankly, we're insulted.

27:15.219 --> 27:18.473
But I would like to roll through
all the options.

27:18.473 --> 27:21.975
So, as a brother,
what's the top option?

27:21.975 --> 27:23.602
Okay, let me have a little look.

27:23.602 --> 27:25.313
I would love to get to Europe.

27:25.313 --> 27:27.189
Can I creep up through the underbelly?

27:27.189 --> 27:29.066
Come up through the Balkans?

27:29.066 --> 27:32.028
A couple of senior departures?
Berlin by Christmas?

27:32.028 --> 27:34.990
They may be willing to talk
Slovenia or Slovakia.

27:38.742 --> 27:42.288
Yeah, I think I'm a no on the Slos.

27:42.288 --> 27:45.041
What about South Korea?

27:45.041 --> 27:47.419
South Korea?
Top ten GDP,

27:47.419 --> 27:51.463
major geopolitical player?
I feel like that would be tough.

27:52.090 --> 27:55.426
- North Korea.
- Easy, my liege.

27:55.426 --> 27:58.053
You don't know. Nobody knows.
That's the point.

27:58.053 --> 28:00.347
I could open it up like Nixon did China.

28:00.347 --> 28:02.517
Con, they're not going to put you
anywhere with nukes.

28:02.517 --> 28:05.602
I don't think I want to go anywhere
that doesn't have nukes.

28:06.562 --> 28:08.106
Well, how do you like Oman?

28:08.106 --> 28:10.232
- Oman?
- Yeah.

28:10.232 --> 28:13.444
Poor man's Saudi Arabia
or rich man's Yemen ?

28:14.737 --> 28:18.408
I'll have to check. See what
my wo-man thinks about Oman.

28:19.200 --> 28:22.036
- Nice. Yep, good.
- All right, good.

28:24.956 --> 28:28.542
Well, I guess essentially
I'm a self-made guy

28:28.542 --> 28:30.836
who came up with a really cool
product that people love.

28:30.836 --> 28:33.922
I send you my 9.99 a month.
I'm no hater.

28:33.922 --> 28:35.175
Appreciate it.

28:35.175 --> 28:38.927
You Daniel is troubled
by out of control algos.

28:38.927 --> 28:44.225
He is worried that you guys are
going to data-mine us all to death.

28:44.225 --> 28:48.520
I totally get that.
And in terms of all this,

28:49.230 --> 28:51.398
someone's going
to pick up the assets, right?

28:51.398 --> 28:52.901
So who's that going to be?

28:53.443 --> 28:56.362
Is it going to be, no offense, Shiv,

28:56.362 --> 29:01.408
but the failsons? Really?
Is that a good option?

29:01.951 --> 29:03.452
They will do what he did,

29:03.452 --> 29:08.082
but they will do it stupider
and uglier and less amenable.

29:08.583 --> 29:12.212
And surprisingly, Lukas
is actually pretty amenable.

29:12.212 --> 29:13.755
- Amenable?
- Yes.

29:13.755 --> 29:15.256
What about leadership at ATN?

29:15.256 --> 29:19.593
Well, I would definitely make some
major leadership changes at the top.

29:19.593 --> 29:21.054
- Really?
- Yes.

29:25.599 --> 29:27.227
Tom...

29:29.145 --> 29:31.021
I can't wiggle my way in there.

29:31.940 --> 29:34.733
He's just busy slobbering up Nate
with Shiv.

29:36.152 --> 29:37.903
They're just talking, Greg.

29:39.613 --> 29:42.617
Can you push a few more of these?

29:42.617 --> 29:46.453
Actually put them away,
so we create a kind of scarcity thing.

29:47.996 --> 29:49.457
- Hey, man.
- Hey, man.

29:49.457 --> 29:51.793
Brother. Been a minute.

29:52.960 --> 29:56.965
Listen, I know you haven't had
a chance to talk. I'm sorry, man.

29:58.091 --> 30:00.343
- Yeah.
- He was...

30:01.928 --> 30:03.929
What can I say?
Jesus, I can't imagine.

30:03.929 --> 30:08.685
Yeah, it's tough, but, you know,
life keeps it rolling, right?

30:09.728 --> 30:13.648
But you, man, you throwing off
some Kingmaker vibes.

30:13.648 --> 30:15.691
Fuck yeah.
How's Daniel?

30:16.359 --> 30:17.735
Can I shoot your names?

30:17.735 --> 30:22.032
You can make a decent cabinet
for my fucking poker night.

30:22.032 --> 30:25.201
Sure, yeah, yeah.
The activists would love that.

30:25.952 --> 30:29.163
Look, dude, I'm just gonna give you
my rap straight, okay?

30:29.163 --> 30:30.748
Is that okay?

30:31.790 --> 30:34.044
I think we could be really good
for you guys.

30:35.086 --> 30:38.465
Like, I'm talking major reset
of the dialogue,

30:39.089 --> 30:41.593
which I am personally invested in.

30:42.344 --> 30:44.887
But that only happens
if this deal goes away.

30:48.474 --> 30:50.769
Yeah, you know, board-wise,
shareholder-wise,

30:50.769 --> 30:52.186
we can't come out publicly,

30:52.186 --> 30:55.731
but you should know the deal
is headed to the woodshed.

30:56.399 --> 30:57.900
GoJo has had incredible growth.

30:57.900 --> 31:00.235
He's a charismatic figure,
but he's gonna get wrung out.

31:00.235 --> 31:03.281
And, you know, there is really
legitimate concern here.

31:04.073 --> 31:06.868
DOJ or FTC balking
at the sports overlap,

31:06.868 --> 31:09.119
the FCC over foreign ownership
of broadcast.

31:09.119 --> 31:11.581
- He's pitching me.
- I'm telling you.

31:11.581 --> 31:14.333
I think maybe CFIUS might have
a word to say

31:14.333 --> 31:20.798
about Matsson's extreme political
positions and fucking Holocaust jokes.

31:22.717 --> 31:25.053
Sure, so what?

31:25.679 --> 31:29.139
So, you guys come out
for regulation pretty soon,

31:29.766 --> 31:32.686
and we give you a better ride
in the first hundred days.

31:32.686 --> 31:35.688
Man, I forgot how eager you were
to get laid at a party.

31:36.480 --> 31:37.773
Let me check in.

31:37.773 --> 31:41.027
Cool. All right, love it.
Would love to get laid.

31:43.487 --> 31:44.990
Could we have the room?

31:47.449 --> 31:51.870
So, you're doing great. Yeah,
eminently plausible. Nice wordings.

31:51.870 --> 31:54.415
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah, you're doing good.

31:54.415 --> 31:56.459
Nate, I think, really liked talking
to you,

31:56.459 --> 31:58.712
and Carly loved you, so yeah.

31:58.712 --> 32:01.923
Cool, cool. I wasn't sure, because
I don't always read people great.

32:01.923 --> 32:04.049
It's good. You're good.

32:04.049 --> 32:05.468
Yeah, you've hit the A-team,

32:05.468 --> 32:07.053
and so now I think we should build
your profile

32:07.053 --> 32:09.723
with the op-ed narcissists
and the beltway psychos.

32:10.556 --> 32:12.100
I like this,

32:12.100 --> 32:15.310
I thought these people would
be very complicated,

32:15.310 --> 32:18.606
but they're not. It's basically
just like money and gossip.

32:18.606 --> 32:22.152
That's all it is. Just money
and gossip. That's everything.

32:22.152 --> 32:24.361
All right. Take me down
to the Paradise City.

32:24.361 --> 32:29.284
Great. Well, at this point, I think
I would like to ask the question,

32:29.284 --> 32:32.745
not that I don't love heaving you
around like a great lump of pine

32:32.745 --> 32:37.207
and making you shine, but what have
you done for me lately?

32:39.919 --> 32:44.674
Okay, well, what do you want?

32:46.217 --> 32:51.013
I really like talking to you.
You can have whatever you want.

32:52.806 --> 32:56.311
Okay, so this situation is not without
risk for me,

32:56.311 --> 32:59.605
so if I was to move to actively
engage in assisting you

32:59.605 --> 33:01.775
with the acquisition,
then I would need to know

33:01.775 --> 33:05.153
that it leads to a very, very,
very significant role.

33:05.153 --> 33:07.696
Three verys. Wow.

33:08.657 --> 33:11.409
Okay. Carry on.

33:12.285 --> 33:15.245
So, I know the company.
I know everything.

33:15.245 --> 33:17.666
I know my way around.
I'm collaborative.

33:17.666 --> 33:19.250
I have the name.

33:19.250 --> 33:23.295
I'm hot shit and I'm ready to go.
Okay?

33:25.673 --> 33:27.466
Okay.

33:29.260 --> 33:30.844
- Can I think?
- No.

33:32.971 --> 33:36.600
All right. Okay.

33:37.393 --> 33:43.357
I would hate to lose you. Why
don't we circle back in a bit? Okay?

33:43.357 --> 33:45.442
Yeah, sure. Of course.

33:46.068 --> 33:48.320
You are doing good out there,
you know.

33:48.320 --> 33:50.323
You're like a self-teaching AI.

33:50.323 --> 33:51.949
I'm just going to take five

33:51.949 --> 33:54.076
and then I'll be back with
the dipshits and limp dicks.

33:54.076 --> 33:55.160
Yeah, sure.

33:59.666 --> 34:03.295
Hey, hey, hey. Boney Moroney.
Can you lend a hand?

34:05.130 --> 34:08.632
Matsson?
Can you like look after him?

34:08.632 --> 34:14.138
I guess he occasionally has
expressed a distaste in the past

34:14.138 --> 34:17.766
for my particular flavor of me.

34:17.766 --> 34:19.435
Just find him a blunt.
Something stronger.

34:19.435 --> 34:21.604
Point his dick in the direction
of some fissile material.

34:21.604 --> 34:23.982
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Okay.

34:23.982 --> 34:25.357
I can try.

34:29.612 --> 34:32.282
So, Tom, are you going to imperil
democracy tomorrow?

34:33.490 --> 34:36.535
Yeah, you against the wall, you against
the wall, you're a nice guy,

34:36.535 --> 34:39.204
you can live.
That's what I'll do.

34:39.204 --> 34:41.290
Come on, please.
I can assure you,

34:41.290 --> 34:43.667
Mr. Mild here is a one pepper
menu item.

34:43.667 --> 34:45.045
Thank you, dear.

34:45.045 --> 34:49.716
And plans after the deal goes through?
I hear you may be headed elsewhere.

34:49.716 --> 34:54.220
I've always got options.
Why, what did you hear?

34:54.220 --> 34:56.388
Well, maybe I heard wrong.

34:59.184 --> 35:00.809
Okay. Okay.

35:00.809 --> 35:02.270
Sorry, excuse me, Scott.

35:03.479 --> 35:08.485
That is some top shelf rat fuck
in there. Yeah, bye bye.

35:08.485 --> 35:11.154
The deep dive on Matsson,
it's pretty juicy.

35:11.154 --> 35:13.490
Apparently he's been creepin'
on Ebba,

35:13.490 --> 35:15.657
his comms, sending her
some weird shit.

35:15.657 --> 35:18.035
Blood, bits of hair,
perhaps some other things.

35:18.577 --> 35:21.081
Nate!
You're gonna want in on this.

35:21.081 --> 35:23.499
Nate, you wanna hear something
nasty about someone terrible?

35:23.499 --> 35:25.793
- Matsson.
- Sure. I gotta go.

35:26.585 --> 35:27.920
- You're going?
- Yeah.

35:27.920 --> 35:31.466
Okay, but we're good on the situation?

35:31.466 --> 35:34.468
Daniel's people aren't too comfortable
with me rubbing shoulders with you,

35:34.468 --> 35:38.639
and Coop likes to yap.

35:39.891 --> 35:43.936
Looks a little cozy, so... Apologies.

35:43.936 --> 35:47.481
But I think there is something here.
These are legitimate concerns.

35:48.233 --> 35:53.278
Just tell Daniel, I mean, we can
make primetime safe for you.

35:53.278 --> 35:54.656
I'm gonna be straight with you.

35:54.656 --> 35:58.617
I don't feel comfortable with
the tenor of this conversation.

35:58.617 --> 36:01.078
You don't feel comfortable
with the tenor of this conversation?

36:01.078 --> 36:03.873
Don't play hall monitor with me, bro.

36:03.873 --> 36:07.711
Right? I know you.
I know who you are, my friend.

36:07.711 --> 36:09.754
I don't know what you
think this is. I'm not Gil.

36:09.754 --> 36:13.215
You're not Logan.
That's a good thing.

36:13.842 --> 36:15.427
I'll see you.

36:20.682 --> 36:24.518
And so where would we live exactly
in Oman?

36:24.518 --> 36:27.439
In Muscat, I should think.
In a compound.

36:28.272 --> 36:30.899
Okay, but would it be above ground?

36:30.899 --> 36:35.363
Of course, above ground,
Willa. Pearl of Arabia.

36:36.740 --> 36:41.036
Okay. The Sultan's word
has the force of the law. Great.

36:41.036 --> 36:43.079
At the airport, we walk right through.

36:44.581 --> 36:46.498
And this is for Mencken?

36:46.999 --> 36:49.252
You know, all my family and friends
hate Mencken.

36:49.252 --> 36:51.963
Diplomatic plates.
You can park anywhere.

36:51.963 --> 36:54.173
You can drive on the sidewalk.
Your police can't touch you.

36:54.173 --> 36:56.176
Running people over
is not a selling point.

37:06.561 --> 37:10.564
- Fucking Greg!
- Hey, my Swedish friends.

37:11.691 --> 37:13.108
Nice to see you.

37:15.320 --> 37:18.364
Fucking hanger-on.
Fucking dingleberry.

37:18.948 --> 37:21.576
Dude, I'm on a charm offensive here.
Can you be kind?

37:23.244 --> 37:26.289
- Would you like to join us?
- Would you like to fuck off?

37:27.039 --> 37:28.749
Oh my God.

37:29.708 --> 37:31.962
Serious, Oskar. I'm going to fire you.

37:33.046 --> 37:35.799
Okay, Ebba.
Can you fire him, please?

37:36.423 --> 37:40.011
Can you?
I'm sorry. Is this boring you?

37:40.719 --> 37:43.014
I've seen him cut your balls
a hundred times.

37:43.014 --> 37:44.390
Yeah, it's a little bit boring.

37:44.390 --> 37:49.354
Look at him. Sadistic face.
He loves it. He loves being fired.

37:49.354 --> 37:52.147
I would like to fire Ebba, though.

37:52.147 --> 37:56.819
Yeah. But I can't because
she's created and fostered

37:56.819 --> 38:00.824
this situation in which I find it
very difficult to do what I want.

38:00.824 --> 38:04.743
I'm not saying you've done it on
purpose, but it is quite interesting

38:05.495 --> 38:09.373
that you have sort of tenure.
Because we mingled.

38:09.373 --> 38:11.584
- Lukas.
- Ebba.

38:11.584 --> 38:15.922
I'm not sure if you're kidding,
but I could help.

38:17.382 --> 38:18.967
I'd fire her if you want.

38:18.967 --> 38:20.384
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

38:20.384 --> 38:27.182
I'd fire her right now. I've got some
recent experience in this arena.

38:27.182 --> 38:28.852
Would you do that for me?

38:28.852 --> 38:30.686
Instantly, sure.

38:30.686 --> 38:34.524
It's on. Guys, gather around.

38:34.524 --> 38:37.319
This guy is about to fire
my senior comms.

38:37.319 --> 38:38.652
No hard feelings.

38:38.652 --> 38:41.364
The jokes are funny.
The jokes are very funny.

38:43.365 --> 38:45.994
Ebba! Come on.

38:47.203 --> 38:50.456
You know what, Lukas?
I wish you would fire me.

38:50.456 --> 38:55.587
Ebba!

38:56.463 --> 39:01.050
It's not the attitude of the employee
that we want at our company.

39:09.976 --> 39:11.310
You okay?

39:12.895 --> 39:14.147
Hi.

39:15.774 --> 39:19.069
We just wanted to check in
and make sure you're okay

39:19.069 --> 39:23.280
on a human level. We saw...
Are you good?

39:23.280 --> 39:26.617
I'm totally fine.
Don't worry about it.

39:26.617 --> 39:28.787
All right. Well, good.
That's good to hear.

39:28.787 --> 39:31.663
Yeah, yeah. Totally.

39:31.663 --> 39:33.500
He seems kind of awful.

39:35.376 --> 39:39.923
We built his whole rep.

39:41.548 --> 39:43.468
He's not even a real coder.

39:43.468 --> 39:47.722
Someone gave him like a box
of tech and he took it to market.

39:47.722 --> 39:50.350
- Bravo.
- Yeah, bravo.

39:50.350 --> 39:55.563
We just wanted to say
we sympathize with all this shit.

39:56.772 --> 40:00.151
Well, I'll be out in February anyways.

40:00.151 --> 40:01.944
Really? That's a shame.

40:02.654 --> 40:08.618
And is that because
of the sending you of whatnots?

40:09.953 --> 40:12.038
What? No.

40:12.580 --> 40:17.584
I mean, that's pretty much
the least of his worries right now.

40:17.584 --> 40:20.088
Okay. All right. Because?

40:21.714 --> 40:23.757
- India.
- India. Right.

40:24.508 --> 40:28.930
And I feel like I know this,
but what are the details here with that?

40:29.472 --> 40:34.309
The details? I'm going
to give you all the details. Sure.

40:35.145 --> 40:36.688
Can I bum a smoke?

40:37.896 --> 40:39.606
Yeah. Sure.

40:44.571 --> 40:49.533
So ATN is saying "Dems positive
polls a radical misinformation plot".

40:50.076 --> 40:52.871
- Ballsy.
- Like to keep things peppery.

40:52.871 --> 40:55.290
I mean, did we mention he's tired?
Yeah.

40:55.290 --> 40:59.293
I guess he can't be across
everything, can you, tired boy?

40:59.293 --> 41:01.378
But you should call Pam on that

41:01.713 --> 41:03.422
because everyone here is
needling me.

41:03.422 --> 41:05.300
Then you should tell them
to stop wetting their pants.

41:05.300 --> 41:08.802
Well, I get that Tom, but also
you heard about the Phoenix thing?

41:08.802 --> 41:11.805
The O'Malley's firebombed
a fucking campaign office.

41:11.805 --> 41:16.186
A firecracker. A pair of
firecrackers taped together.

41:16.186 --> 41:19.188
Sorry. May we borrow
the lady for a second?

41:19.188 --> 41:21.441
- Sure.
- Guess what?

41:21.441 --> 41:24.110
What? The Phoenix thing?
It's pretty wild.

41:24.110 --> 41:26.112
Nope. Matsson's numbers are funky.

41:28.447 --> 41:30.450
Sorry. What the fuck
are you talking about?

41:30.450 --> 41:32.994
Ebba spilled.
Screwy metrics in India.

41:32.994 --> 41:37.082
Matsson has been peddling bundles
of South Asian packing peanuts.

41:37.082 --> 41:40.251
What? You mean like...
Significant numbers?

41:40.251 --> 41:42.879
Yeah. We think so. Big, big.

41:43.296 --> 41:46.549
I fucking knew he was a bullshitter.
I'm telling you, new money.

41:46.549 --> 41:49.177
You gotta hold those fresh bills
to the light.

41:51.137 --> 41:53.264
Okay. Fuck.

41:54.891 --> 41:56.977
You said a hundred scalps
in three days ?

41:56.977 --> 41:58.436
A hundred.

41:58.436 --> 42:03.982
Mr. Nephew, that's quite a number.
I thought you were backwash

42:03.982 --> 42:08.530
at the bottom of the gene pool,
but this is something else.

42:08.530 --> 42:10.155
Yes, you underestimated me

42:10.155 --> 42:13.409
and that's exactly
how I wanted it to look.

42:14.703 --> 42:16.912
Well, how did you do it?

42:18.915 --> 42:22.377
I don't know. I just do it.
Just jackknife right in there

42:22.377 --> 42:24.087
and slit their throat.

42:24.878 --> 42:28.842
It must feel afterwards
a little bit shitty, right?

42:28.842 --> 42:35.305
Honestly, not really. HR says
I'm the right guy for the job

42:35.305 --> 42:38.267
because it looks like I care,
but I don't.

42:38.267 --> 42:39.686
Not a good person.

42:39.686 --> 42:45.900
No, I am. It's just you gotta do
what you gotta do. Right?

42:46.401 --> 42:47.986
Do you though?

42:47.986 --> 42:52.865
Hey! There she is.
Welcome to the kids' table.

42:52.865 --> 42:55.534
Can I talk to you for a second?

42:55.534 --> 42:57.537
Yeah. It's time
to up periscopes?

42:58.038 --> 43:00.540
Yeah. Sorry to break up
the brains trust.

43:00.540 --> 43:02.083
Sit.

43:02.625 --> 43:05.002
A butcher with a smile.

43:08.130 --> 43:11.509
Why are we running?
Is there a fire or what?

43:11.509 --> 43:13.344
Yeah. There might be.

43:13.344 --> 43:16.097
So what's happening
with your numbers?

43:17.056 --> 43:18.932
- What numbers?
- What numbers?

43:19.516 --> 43:20.852
Lukas.

43:22.020 --> 43:24.064
- In India?
- Yeah.

43:24.813 --> 43:26.815
Is this Ebba or Oskar?

43:29.026 --> 43:30.110
Okay.

43:34.114 --> 43:38.827
Well, there's a little issue
that we're looking into

43:39.704 --> 43:42.915
with subscriber numbers
being bullshit.

43:42.915 --> 43:47.504
Not bullshit, but a little bit bullshit.

43:47.504 --> 43:50.048
What does a little bit bullshit mean?

43:50.048 --> 43:53.884
Well, maybe we discovered a metrics
error that has overstated our subs

43:53.884 --> 43:58.639
in India. If there were two Indias,
it would make sense.

43:58.639 --> 44:00.558
You maybe discovered?

44:00.558 --> 44:03.228
Yeah, but there isn't two Indias.
There's only one India.

44:03.228 --> 44:06.063
It's a long story,

44:06.063 --> 44:08.233
but it's an emerging market.

44:08.233 --> 44:09.733
It's all wet cement.

44:10.609 --> 44:12.861
So, stock and cash deal.

44:12.861 --> 44:15.657
The board would be well within
their rights to pull out.

44:15.657 --> 44:17.366
You know that, obviously.

44:17.366 --> 44:21.454
So, when are you addressing?
Like, how are you handling?

44:22.079 --> 44:26.001
I'm not gonna, I don't want
some forum monkeys

44:26.001 --> 44:28.502
just shorting me.
I don't like when people get into me.

44:28.502 --> 44:30.045
It's gonna get out eventually.

44:30.045 --> 44:33.590
Or we buy Waystar and it gets
lost in the deal dazzle.

44:33.590 --> 44:37.470
SEC, DOJ... Is this even legal?

44:37.470 --> 44:38.887
We close quickly

44:38.887 --> 44:41.182
and then shit will get crazy good.

44:42.600 --> 44:45.353
By next quarter the numbers
will be real, probably.

44:47.646 --> 44:50.190
Come on, it's kind of funny
though, isn't it?

44:50.984 --> 44:53.861
I know it's pretty bad.

44:54.279 --> 44:57.573
- Yeah.
- You can fix it though, right?

44:58.783 --> 45:01.953
Yeah, sure. I'll just build
another fucking India.

45:02.579 --> 45:04.329
Love that. Build another India.

45:05.540 --> 45:06.915
Yeah, that's my girl.

45:12.796 --> 45:13.923
Fuck me!

45:19.053 --> 45:22.766
Hey, Gerri. Let me guess.
"I'll have a Martini."

45:24.476 --> 45:26.852
Can we chat about stuff?
I might need your advice.

45:26.852 --> 45:28.395
No.

45:28.395 --> 45:31.023
No? Just no? Gerri!

45:31.482 --> 45:32.983
What?

45:32.983 --> 45:36.905
The thing, the firing you thing?
That wasn't real.

45:36.905 --> 45:38.531
- No?
- No.

45:38.531 --> 45:41.909
It was like in the heat of the,
you know?

45:41.909 --> 45:43.119
No.

45:43.119 --> 45:46.622
Okay. Well, come on,
let's have a fucking chat, okay?

45:47.374 --> 45:50.085
I'll stand in a cupboard and jerk off
while you explain to me

45:50.085 --> 45:52.419
what the SEC is, okay?

45:53.546 --> 45:55.339
Really? No? Too soon?

45:55.923 --> 45:57.759
What do you want?
You want, like, a sorry?

45:57.759 --> 45:59.677
I got a whole purse full of sorrys.
I'm sorry.

45:59.677 --> 46:01.846
I'm out. I'm done.

46:01.846 --> 46:03.847
Bullshit.
Dad fired people all the time.

46:03.847 --> 46:06.226
I was just feeling kind of fire-ish.

46:06.226 --> 46:08.477
I have some requirements
you should know about.

46:08.853 --> 46:11.439
Several of which have been officially communicated

46:11.439 --> 46:16.486
and some that I thought I should,
you know, say in person.

46:16.486 --> 46:18.655
Okay. Robo-Gerri.

46:18.655 --> 46:20.115
First of all, I want money.

46:20.115 --> 46:23.659
Eye-watering sums.
Hundreds of millions of dollars.

46:23.659 --> 46:24.828
No. Pass.

46:24.828 --> 46:28.247
So I have retained personal
reputation management.

46:28.247 --> 46:29.832
They will be on the line

46:29.832 --> 46:32.960
when Karolina does her background briefings

46:32.960 --> 46:34.879
off a set of my bullet points.

46:34.879 --> 46:37.756
I will set off your bullet points.

46:37.756 --> 46:42.595
And if I ever get a whiff of anything
undermining my narrative any time

46:42.595 --> 46:44.888
in the next five years, I will sue

46:44.888 --> 46:49.019
and I will go public with those many
pictures of your genitalia

46:49.019 --> 46:51.770
that I have in my possession.
Have I made myself clear?

46:51.770 --> 46:54.898
Yes, absolutely. It's been a pleasure
working with you, Gerri. Thanks.

46:54.898 --> 46:57.026
I could have got you there.

46:59.570 --> 47:01.865
But nope. Nope.

47:01.865 --> 47:04.451
Nope. See ya.

47:16.421 --> 47:19.882
Hey. Con, can we settle this now?

47:19.882 --> 47:23.386
Everyone is quite freaked out about
this political firebombing in Arizona.

47:23.386 --> 47:26.556
The pop-ups in Phoenix, the waste
paper basket on fire.

47:26.556 --> 47:28.933
I think a filing cabinet was
in the ICU. Can we draft?

47:28.933 --> 47:32.228
Well, actually there's been
a slight change of heart.

47:32.228 --> 47:34.356
Get the fuck out of here. You got it.

47:34.356 --> 47:37.524
You got your bobble. It's great.
Let's write up a fucking statement.

47:37.524 --> 47:40.778
Wind up the old fax machine
and fart it out to your oddball army.

47:41.236 --> 47:44.907
We wonder, Roman,
if he might have invested too much

47:44.907 --> 47:47.451
in this campaign
to just drop out now.

47:47.451 --> 47:49.245
That's so cool. You tried,

47:49.245 --> 47:51.581
you failed, you move on.
Find something new.

47:51.581 --> 47:54.917
He's fought hard and we want to find
out what might happen.

47:54.917 --> 47:57.295
He might write a book about
this or a speaker circuit or...

47:57.295 --> 47:59.505
Hey, nothing is going to happen, okay?

47:59.505 --> 48:01.715
Anything might happen
tomorrow, actually.

48:01.715 --> 48:02.926
Really? Anything?

48:02.926 --> 48:05.053
Because that's the beauty of this
little system

48:05.053 --> 48:06.887
that we have called democracy.

48:06.887 --> 48:08.847
Come. Bam.
Eat the fucking carrot, okay?

48:08.847 --> 48:10.850
Everyone in this room thinks
you're a fucking joke.

48:10.850 --> 48:13.060
So tell your wife to shut
the fuck up,

48:13.060 --> 48:15.939
cover her shoulders and pack
a fucking bag for Oman, okay?

48:15.939 --> 48:18.399
- I'm talking here. It's okay.
- Easy.

48:20.859 --> 48:23.780
There's one person here
who doesn't think I'm a joke.

48:24.698 --> 48:27.658
So that's who I'm going to listen to, okay?

48:27.658 --> 48:29.536
That's smart.
Yeah, listen to her.

48:29.536 --> 48:32.747
Willa, honey.
Bye. Nice to meet you.

48:32.747 --> 48:35.208
Pleasure, sir.
You got my vote. 100 percent.

48:35.208 --> 48:37.210
I am trying to help you.

48:41.255 --> 48:44.759
Really nice party. Cool, cool family.

48:45.300 --> 48:47.011
Thanks, man. Tweet about it.

48:49.347 --> 48:53.308
So who's going out tonight
in this shitty fucking town?

48:53.308 --> 48:56.604
Anyone? I got to say,
it's pretty depressing from up here.

48:56.604 --> 48:59.149
You can really see
how second world it is.

48:59.149 --> 49:01.483
I don't know.
Pretty happening town, famously.

49:01.483 --> 49:02.819
Really? Is it, though?

49:02.819 --> 49:07.032
Compared to Singapore,
Seoul? It's like Legoland.

49:07.032 --> 49:08.323
You know we still run shit.

49:09.324 --> 49:12.245
- Like, as in, only in New York.
- Yeah.

49:12.245 --> 49:15.373
Right. Okay. Well,
nothing happens in New York

49:15.373 --> 49:16.833
that doesn't happen everywhere.

49:16.833 --> 49:18.418
You should get that written on a cup.

49:18.418 --> 49:20.294
Shouldn't he get that written
on a cup?

49:20.294 --> 49:22.088
That would look so cool.

49:22.088 --> 49:24.799
You could sell that in a head shop
in Rotterdam.

49:24.799 --> 49:27.260
Could be a good business for you.

49:27.260 --> 49:30.055
Because I hear you might
need some new revenue streams.

49:32.098 --> 49:36.853
Really, really good presentation,
by the way. Loved it.

49:37.436 --> 49:40.899
Can't wait to get into the predictions,
man. Those media predictions.

49:40.899 --> 49:43.359
- It's gonna be fun.
- I'm excited about that.

49:43.359 --> 49:44.818
Estimates, you know, estimates.

49:44.818 --> 49:49.199
But you, man,
your numbers exploding.

49:49.199 --> 49:52.242
Like, literally unbelievable.

49:52.242 --> 49:55.746
Well, thank you.
And congrats to you, as well.

49:56.081 --> 49:57.915
Because I hear your numbers are gay.

49:57.915 --> 49:59.500
- My numbers are what?
- Gay.

49:59.500 --> 50:02.086
- My numbers are gay?
- Yeah.

50:02.086 --> 50:05.048
You had this cute little valuation,

50:05.048 --> 50:08.093
and your numbers
just came out as gay.

50:08.093 --> 50:09.843
It's kind of homophobic, man.

50:09.843 --> 50:13.223
Dude, just let the
wave hit you. Float out.

50:14.014 --> 50:15.976
I think I am the wave,
though, actually.

50:15.976 --> 50:18.937
You think you are the wave?
Because you love the deal?

50:18.937 --> 50:22.356
Are you kidding? Biggest
overpay in history. Love that shit.

50:22.356 --> 50:25.025
Love it.
Love the deal.

50:25.025 --> 50:28.446
- Love the deal.
- Love the deal.

50:30.114 --> 50:32.324
Come on.
Come on, brother.

50:32.324 --> 50:34.536
Love the deal.

50:35.620 --> 50:36.578
Yes.

50:37.664 --> 50:40.458
- Love the deal.
- Love the deal.

50:41.918 --> 50:44.837
- The fuck? Bit of a show.
- Hugging it out.

50:46.006 --> 50:47.674
- I'm gonna...
- What?

50:47.674 --> 50:51.510
I'm going to bed. I'm bushwhacked.
My eyes are sandpaper.

50:51.510 --> 50:54.431
Well, you can stay up for just
a little longer

50:54.431 --> 50:55.932
and say goodnight to people together.

50:55.932 --> 50:57.808
Do you know what
my day looks like tomorrow?

50:57.808 --> 50:59.686
Tom, you're not doing anything.

50:59.686 --> 51:01.771
You're just looking
for shiny foreheads. It's fine.

51:01.771 --> 51:03.815
Stay for 45 minutes more.

51:03.815 --> 51:08.277
I'm just a little tired because
all the fun gossip

51:08.277 --> 51:10.863
that I've been hearing
from everywhere at this party

51:10.863 --> 51:14.367
in my house is that
I'm gonna be shit-canned.

51:14.367 --> 51:17.370
- I got faith in you, man.
- Always been a loyal servant.

51:20.205 --> 51:21.499
Sorry.

51:23.001 --> 51:24.210
Not helpful.

51:28.882 --> 51:30.008
What the fuck is wrong with you?

51:30.008 --> 51:32.594
I just really do need to get
some sleep. I'm sorry.

51:32.594 --> 51:34.803
- Can we just leave it there, please?
- You're tired. I get it.

51:34.803 --> 51:37.182
You keep on fucking saying,
so yeah. You're tired.

51:37.182 --> 51:39.475
Okay. I'm tired.
Let's leave it there.

51:39.475 --> 51:41.478
- Keep fucking telling everyone.
- Okay. Okay. I'll stop.

51:41.478 --> 51:43.687
You're tired. I get it. I'm sorry.

51:43.687 --> 51:46.732
I am just worried about

51:47.316 --> 51:50.486
maybe I've nailed myself
to the Matsson Cross

51:50.486 --> 51:53.113
and he might turn out
to be bullshit.

51:53.113 --> 51:56.158
You know, he's erratic and,
you know, maybe he isn't real.

51:56.158 --> 51:58.911
Shiv, he's real. He's the future.

51:58.911 --> 52:00.412
No, Tom.

52:02.539 --> 52:05.835
There is a time bomb in his numbers
and I might get blown up.

52:05.835 --> 52:08.837
You'll be fine. You'll always be fine.

52:08.837 --> 52:11.882
No. I am fucking my family for this.

52:12.466 --> 52:13.842
Can I just say something?

52:14.927 --> 52:16.262
At this party here,

52:16.262 --> 52:20.475
there are maybe 40 of the most
important people in America

52:20.475 --> 52:24.521
and you have just walked
all around all evening

52:24.521 --> 52:27.315
telling them all
that I'm going to get fired.

52:27.315 --> 52:33.737
No. It was implied, likely, as a little
part of a tactical kind of joke.

52:33.737 --> 52:38.118
Will you explain to me the joke?

52:38.118 --> 52:41.204
Because I don't get the fucking joke.
I don't get the joke.

52:41.204 --> 52:43.999
It was something that he said
that isn't true that we needed to say.

52:43.999 --> 52:46.291
But you stood by his side
and he said it

52:46.291 --> 52:48.670
and you were like, "Okay, well,
that sounds good to me."

52:48.670 --> 52:51.298
I'm not doing this right now. No.

52:52.173 --> 52:54.508
I am in serious trouble.
That was a play.

52:54.508 --> 52:57.761
You will be okay because you are
a tough fucking bitch

52:57.761 --> 53:01.849
who will always survive
because you do what you need.

53:01.849 --> 53:04.435
You will do whatever you need.

53:04.435 --> 53:06.729
Yeah? Really? Sure you're not projecting

53:06.729 --> 53:08.647
because that is actually you.

53:12.776 --> 53:14.445
Should we have a real conversation?

53:14.445 --> 53:16.906
- With a scorpion? No.
- That was a friendly thing.

53:16.906 --> 53:19.158
Real friendly.

53:21.411 --> 53:27.083
I'm a scorpion. You're a hyena.
You're a street rat.

53:27.083 --> 53:29.084
Actually, no, you're a fucking snake.

53:29.084 --> 53:31.712
Here's a dead snake to wear
as a necktie, Tom.

53:31.712 --> 53:33.088
Why aren't you laughing?

53:36.884 --> 53:39.345
I wonder if we shouldn't clear the air.

53:39.345 --> 53:40.971
Yeah? Sure.

53:40.971 --> 53:44.683
I think that you can be
a very selfish person,

53:44.683 --> 53:48.647
and I think you find it very hard
to think about me.

53:48.647 --> 53:53.401
And I think you shouldn't
have even married me, actually.

53:53.401 --> 53:55.904
What the fuck? What the actual fuck?

53:55.904 --> 54:00.158
You proposed to me
on my lowest fucking ebb.

54:00.158 --> 54:02.451
My dad was dying.
What was I supposed to say?

54:02.451 --> 54:04.995
- Perhaps no.
- I didn't want to hurt your feelings.

54:04.995 --> 54:06.956
Thanks. Thanks for that.

54:06.956 --> 54:10.460
You really kept me safe while
you ran off to fuck the phone book.

54:10.460 --> 54:13.672
Fuck off. You're a hick.
A conservative hick.

54:13.672 --> 54:16.465
And then you hid it because
you were so scared

54:16.465 --> 54:18.467
of how fucking awful you are.

54:18.467 --> 54:21.053
You were only with me
to get to power.

54:21.053 --> 54:23.098
Well, you got it now, Tom.
You've got it.

54:23.098 --> 54:24.975
I'm with you because I love you.

54:24.975 --> 54:28.060
Bullshit.
You're fucking me for my DNA.

54:28.060 --> 54:30.437
You're fucking me for a fucking ladder

54:30.437 --> 54:33.649
because your whole family is striving
and parochial.

54:33.649 --> 54:36.486
That's not a fair characterization.

54:36.486 --> 54:39.197
No? Well, your mom loves me
more than she loves you

54:39.197 --> 54:40.489
because she's cracked.

54:40.489 --> 54:45.119
You want to actually clear the air?
Fine. You betrayed me.

54:45.119 --> 54:50.750
You were going to see me
get sent to fucking prison, Shiv.

54:51.375 --> 54:55.255
And then you fobbed me off with that
fucking undrinkable wine

54:55.255 --> 54:58.757
and you won't have my baby because
you never even thought honestly

54:58.757 --> 55:00.801
you'd be with me more than
like four fucking years.

55:00.801 --> 55:02.886
You offered to go to jail, Tom.

55:02.886 --> 55:06.266
You offered because you're servile.
You're servile.

55:06.266 --> 55:10.478
You are incapable of thinking about
anybody other than yourself

55:10.478 --> 55:14.190
because your sense of who you are,
Shiv, is that fucking big.

55:14.190 --> 55:15.399
You read that in a book, Tom?

55:15.399 --> 55:17.610
You're too fucking transparent
to find in a book.

55:17.610 --> 55:19.528
You're pathetic.

55:19.528 --> 55:21.364
You're a masochist
and you can't even take it.

55:21.364 --> 55:23.240
I think you are incapable of love.

55:23.240 --> 55:27.327
And I think you are maybe not
a good person to have children.

55:29.955 --> 55:32.250
That's not very nice to say, is it?

55:32.250 --> 55:33.751
I'm sorry.

55:35.503 --> 55:41.301
I'm sorry. But you have hurt me
more than you can possibly imagine.

55:41.967 --> 55:46.514
And you took away the last six months
I could have had with my dad.

55:46.514 --> 55:49.059
- No.
- Yes.

55:49.059 --> 55:51.186
You sucked up to him
and you cut me out.

55:52.811 --> 55:56.858
It's not my fault that you didn't get
his approval.

55:58.734 --> 56:01.613
I have given you endless approval

56:01.613 --> 56:04.115
and it doesn't fill you up
because you're broken.

56:07.243 --> 56:08.828
I don't like you.

56:10.455 --> 56:13.874
I don't even care about you.

56:15.585 --> 56:16.877
I don't care.

56:19.130 --> 56:22.007
Have we cleared the air?
Feel good now?

56:22.926 --> 56:26.261
Yep.
Fucking great. Tip top.

56:28.098 --> 56:31.142
You don't deserve me.
And you never did.

56:33.895 --> 56:36.564
And everything came out of that...

56:38.315 --> 56:40.235
So fucking flat.

57:00.463 --> 57:03.049
You find ways to have fun out there?

57:03.049 --> 57:05.968
More or less.
Red wine smells like wet dog.

57:08.554 --> 57:11.516
Listen, I just wanted to do five.
Just me and you.

57:11.516 --> 57:14.060
Just Frankie and Kenny.
Not CEO and chair.

57:14.060 --> 57:15.478
Hell.

57:15.478 --> 57:18.355
I don't think the GoJo deal
is in the best interests

57:18.355 --> 57:19.816
of the shareholders.

57:19.816 --> 57:22.986
- And I would like to explore ways...
- I don't want to hear it, Ken.

57:22.986 --> 57:26.448
What if I told you his subs
in India are significantly inflated?

57:28.907 --> 57:33.078
I'm just going to hit you with this.
What if we run it all the way back?

57:33.078 --> 57:35.664
Do I even want to know
what that means?

57:35.664 --> 57:39.002
We go reverse Viking.
We pillage their village.

57:39.835 --> 57:41.713
Waystar acquires GoJo.

57:47.092 --> 57:49.971
There would have to be major issues.

57:49.971 --> 57:52.890
There are.
What if we could slow this down?

57:52.890 --> 57:54.850
And we eat Matsson's lunch.

57:56.311 --> 57:57.936
Bigger than Dad ever was.

57:59.272 --> 58:00.857
Roman and Shiv?

58:00.857 --> 58:03.526
I don't know. Part of my plans.

58:04.152 --> 58:07.404
I love them,
but not in love with them. You know?

58:07.404 --> 58:08.906
One head, one crown.

58:09.448 --> 58:12.494
But I'll need ballast.
Are you with me?

58:35.057 --> 58:40.021
Hi everyone. Hi.
Bedtime for Bonzo.

58:40.021 --> 58:42.732
Sorry, but please get the fuck out
of my house now.

58:44.776 --> 58:50.114
No, no. Please. Party's over
because I've got to sleep.

58:50.114 --> 58:51.824
It's been a terrific night.
Thank you so much.

58:51.824 --> 58:56.287
No, I'm serious. Off you go.
Go to bed. Enjoy your bed.

58:56.287 --> 58:58.707
Just go home. Cry. I'm done.

58:59.665 --> 59:02.877
I can barely stand,
but I've had enough. Good night.

59:04.087 --> 59:06.506
- Good night, Tom.
- Don't forget your coats!

59:10.135 --> 59:12.345
- Fuck Tom.
- Yeah, fuck Tom.

59:13.388 --> 59:18.476
Fuck Tom.
So, guys, funeral.

59:18.476 --> 59:22.438
If nobody wants to grab it, I'm happy
to take the big energy spot.

59:22.438 --> 59:23.857
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

59:23.857 --> 59:28.193
Yeah, I mean, it seemed like
nobody wanted it, so I got it.

59:28.193 --> 59:29.695
Yeah?

59:29.695 --> 59:32.073
Sure. It's fine.
Knock yourself out.

59:32.948 --> 59:34.200
Just paint it red.

59:34.200 --> 59:36.286
- Yeah? Happy?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

59:36.286 --> 59:38.203
- Happy?
- Happy.

59:38.746 --> 59:40.706
Happy, happy. Headbangers.

59:41.373 --> 59:43.250
Here we are. Okay.

59:46.129 --> 59:47.588
- Good night.
- Good night.
