"Miami's sordid sex scene,
who's to blame?"

01:11.100 --> 01:12.834
That's her. She's the one.

01:14.033 --> 01:15.834
Oh, no. This isn't about Blanche.

01:16.233 --> 01:18.734
Now that I'm associate producer
of <i>Wake-Up! Miami,</i>

01:18.800 --> 01:22.333
I have to come up with show ideas
for sweeps week.

01:22.400 --> 01:24.900
I need something that'll get really big
ratings.

01:24.967 --> 01:28.967
I will have you know there is nothing
sordid about my sex life. Nothing.

01:30.633 --> 01:32.567
Oh, great. Now I'm depressed.

01:34.166 --> 01:39.567
You know what I hate about sweeps week?
The news. It's sex, sex, sex.

01:39.633 --> 01:44.333
Why can't they do serious stories,
stories with political relevance?

01:44.400 --> 01:49.066
Yes, like "Sex in the new Russia,
is it worth standing in line for?"

01:54.166 --> 01:57.633
I've worked on a whole list of ideas
that have nothing to do with sex,

01:57.700 --> 02:00.000
-but they keep turning me down.
-Oh? Like what?

02:00.066 --> 02:02.934
Things I think people
would be interested in,

02:03.000 --> 02:06.133
like "Who's in charge of cheese?"

02:08.266 --> 02:12.400
Or "Lincoln, great statesman
or gas guzzler?"

02:15.500 --> 02:18.467
"Idiots in positions of power."

02:19.567 --> 02:20.834
Good one.

02:23.533 --> 02:26.834
Pussycat, what's short,
wrinkly, and sticks out of my shoes?

02:26.900 --> 02:28.100
You.

02:29.100 --> 02:30.400
My toes.

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
It's that time of year,
mama needs a new pair of shoes.

02:34.967 --> 02:37.567
You've crapped out. I'm not taking you.

02:37.633 --> 02:40.233
Please. The little piggy
that goes, "wee wee wee!"

02:40.300 --> 02:42.166
Doesn't have a nail on it anymore.

02:42.900 --> 02:44.233
No way.

02:44.300 --> 02:47.000
Dorothy Zbornak, now, shame on you.

02:47.066 --> 02:50.400
She is your mother, she's 85 years old,
and she wants new shoes.

02:50.700 --> 02:53.400
How many more chances will you have
to buy her shoes?

02:53.467 --> 02:57.467
What I would give to buy
my mother shoes again.

02:57.533 --> 02:58.900
Do you want to take her?

03:00.400 --> 03:02.200
Screw that. She's your mother.

03:05.467 --> 03:08.734
Sorry, Sophia.
I know how you go on about shoes.

03:08.800 --> 03:10.467
We both know what'll happen.

03:10.533 --> 03:13.834
I take you down to shim shack's,
we walk in the door,

03:13.900 --> 03:15.900
and all the salesmen disappear.

03:15.967 --> 03:20.033
I have to go to the back of the store
and bribe them to come and help you.

03:21.367 --> 03:25.433
-Please. Those people love me.
-For $10 they love you.

03:26.433 --> 03:28.900
Without a tip,
you're just another old lady

03:28.967 --> 03:31.767
wearing men's socks and a bad attitude.

03:32.834 --> 03:35.233
-They love me.
-They hate you.

03:35.300 --> 03:39.133
-Last time, I got a balloon.
-You ripped that out of a kid's hand.

03:40.133 --> 03:42.900
You're upset because I won't take
the first thing they bring out.

03:42.967 --> 03:45.967
-You don't take anything they bring out.
-I took you.

03:50.834 --> 03:54.600
You know what I'm saying.
You complain, you belittle.

03:54.667 --> 03:57.467
Dorothy, I think you're
being too hard on her.

03:57.533 --> 04:00.000
I know how difficult buying shoes can be.

04:00.467 --> 04:03.467
Sometimes you get yourself a really
good-looking salesman,

04:03.533 --> 04:08.834
and you try to pretend you don't notice
his hands caressing your calf...

04:09.233 --> 04:13.133
as he tries to keep his mind on shoes,
but he's thinking, "Dare I peek?"

04:18.066 --> 04:19.934
"Dare I look more?"

04:20.800 --> 04:23.467
"Dare I look where no eyes
have looked before?"

04:25.200 --> 04:30.233
Then as he kneels before you,
beads of perspiration on his forehead,

04:30.300 --> 04:33.533
his breath coming shorter and quicker...

04:34.834 --> 04:39.967
he... ever so gently
slips the supple leather...

04:42.000 --> 04:43.700
on your quivering foot.

04:48.100 --> 04:50.734
And you achieve a perfect fit.

04:57.166 --> 04:59.734
Come on, old woman,
we need shoes now.

05:00.867 --> 05:05.200
(serene music playing)

05:05.266 --> 05:06.734
(doorbell ringing)

05:09.100 --> 05:11.834
-Hello, Angelo.
-Hello, Rose. Is Dorothy here?

05:11.900 --> 05:14.133
Oh, no.
She went with Sophia to get shoes.

05:14.200 --> 05:16.467
She hates taking Sophia for shoes.

05:16.533 --> 05:18.333
I know, but Dorothy decided to go

05:18.400 --> 05:20.333
when Sophia and Blanche
started talking about

05:20.400 --> 05:22.433
whether or not Sophia
should put on underwear.

05:26.400 --> 05:29.900
They said it would be fun to scare
the hell out of the shoe salesman.

05:32.700 --> 05:36.266
I gotta find Dorothy.
I got big, big trouble at the apartment.

05:36.333 --> 05:37.433
What's wrong?

05:37.500 --> 05:41.100
When the people moved out of 3-C,
they left food all over.

05:41.166 --> 05:43.100
We're infested with big bugs.

05:43.166 --> 05:46.166
It's terrible.
I feel like I'm living in a slum.

05:46.233 --> 05:49.367
Now I'll never get a woman
to come over to my place.

05:49.633 --> 05:51.033
Not with these bugs.

05:53.133 --> 05:55.033
Okay, and this body.

05:56.266 --> 05:58.433
But mainly the bugs.

05:59.300 --> 06:01.567
Angelo, take me to your apartment.

06:07.767 --> 06:09.400
Bugs make you hot?

06:11.600 --> 06:14.867
We got big ones and millions of them.

06:15.600 --> 06:18.400
No, but I think it would make
a great story.

06:18.467 --> 06:21.133
Old people living
under terrible conditions.

06:21.200 --> 06:24.533
Come on. We'll stop at the station,
and see if we can get a camera crew.

06:24.600 --> 06:27.266
I want the whole city to see
what you've been going through.

06:27.333 --> 06:30.000
-You mean, I'm gonna be on TV?
-You bet.

06:30.066 --> 06:32.600
-Do I get to put on makeup?
-Well, sure.

06:32.667 --> 06:37.233
Oh, boy.
I mean, makeup, that's sissy stuff.

06:38.834 --> 06:42.200
(calm music playing)

06:42.266 --> 06:43.934
Thank God we're finished.

06:49.166 --> 06:53.233
-I never want to go through that again.
-At least we got the shoes.

06:53.300 --> 06:56.100
And the balloon without
having to pay extra.

06:56.767 --> 07:00.233
I just had to swear
I'd never take you back again.

07:00.300 --> 07:02.367
Shim shack makes you swear that every
year.

07:02.433 --> 07:03.600
In blood?

07:06.166 --> 07:08.433
Sophia, there's something
I don't understand.

07:08.500 --> 07:13.033
Now, you're always a bit ornery,
unpleasant, impolite, even downright mean.

07:13.100 --> 07:16.100
-That's part of your charm.
-Thank you, you bed-hopping relic.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.734
The point I'm trying to make is...

07:41.333 --> 07:45.500
your behavior in this shoe thing
is extreme even for you.

07:45.567 --> 07:46.867
What is going on?

07:46.934 --> 07:49.700
Dorothy always makes me buy
old-lady shoes.

07:49.767 --> 07:51.767
I never get anything new and exciting.

07:51.834 --> 07:54.667
It's just another reminder
of what old age takes away from you...

07:54.967 --> 07:57.100
first husbands, then cute shoes.

07:57.166 --> 07:59.367
What's old age going to
take away from me next?

08:03.967 --> 08:05.300
Hey!

08:05.600 --> 08:07.133
Where's my balloon?

08:11.734 --> 08:13.333
Ma, you wear those shoes

08:13.400 --> 08:16.266
because they're the only shoes
you say you can wear.

08:16.333 --> 08:19.233
Whenever you get other shoes,
you say they're uncomfortable.

08:19.300 --> 08:21.433
I'm cursed with these square feet.

08:21.500 --> 08:24.233
When I was a girl in Sicily,
we were too poor for shoes,

08:24.300 --> 08:26.033
so I wore olive oil cans.

08:28.734 --> 08:31.800
I don't want to be the one
to keep you from being happy.

08:31.867 --> 08:35.367
If you really want new shoes,
I'll take you.

08:36.834 --> 08:38.667
-Turn on the news.
-What's going on?

08:38.734 --> 08:41.667
Oh, today is my lucky day.

08:41.734 --> 08:46.166
While you were gone, Angelo told me about
these big bugs at his place.

08:46.233 --> 08:47.967
He didn't want to make a fuss.

08:48.033 --> 08:50.166
He said he could pass them off
as shellfish

08:50.233 --> 08:51.934
and sell them from the back of his
truck...

08:54.233 --> 08:56.066
but I thought it was a great story.

08:56.133 --> 08:59.567
So did my boss.
He's putting it on tonight's news.

08:59.633 --> 09:01.700
Rose, please tell me you're kidding.

09:01.767 --> 09:05.100
My boss said he wanted
to expose Angelo's landlord

09:05.166 --> 09:07.700
for making him live under
those terrible conditions,

09:07.767 --> 09:09.834
but Angelo wouldn't give us his name.

09:09.900 --> 09:11.834
A Sicilian never squeals. Never.

09:12.667 --> 09:13.967
Did you offer him money?

09:14.433 --> 09:16.867
-No.
-Never. He wouldn't.

09:19.033 --> 09:20.433
Well, it doesn't matter.

09:20.500 --> 09:23.967
I mean, our research department
will find that heartless shylock,

09:24.033 --> 09:25.967
and if they don't, I will.

09:26.033 --> 09:32.066
I'm not going to rest or sleep or eat
until I track that scum down.

09:32.133 --> 09:34.600
Rose, I'm the scum.

09:36.800 --> 09:42.000
Stan and I inherited that building.
I am uncle Angelo's landlord.

09:42.066 --> 09:44.667
Oh, Dorothy, I forgot!

09:46.800 --> 09:52.400
Oh, I feel awful, just awful.
How could I have been so stupid?

09:52.467 --> 09:53.533
It's okay.

09:53.600 --> 09:56.000
I missed the family angle.

09:58.467 --> 10:00.166
He's your uncle.

10:00.633 --> 10:03.266
"Niece makes uncle live in roach motel."

10:05.900 --> 10:08.033
There's Angelo. Turn the sound up.

10:08.600 --> 10:11.667
(Angelo) <i>As you can see,</i>
<i>the bugs are really big,</i>

10:11.734 --> 10:15.200
<i>and when I spray them,</i>
<i>they appear to be laughing at us.</i>

10:16.633 --> 10:18.767
(reporter) <i>The question</i>
<i>all Miami is asking is,</i>

10:18.834 --> 10:20.767
<i>who would make people live</i>
<i>under these conditions?</i>

10:20.834 --> 10:22.600
<i>We have learned this</i>
<i>vermin-infested squalor</i>

10:22.667 --> 10:27.467
<i>is owned by Stanley Zbornak</i>
<i>and his ex-wife Dorothy Zbornak.</i>

10:28.433 --> 10:31.367
-Dorothy, that's your picture!
-Oh, no!

10:33.033 --> 10:34.066
Oh, look.

10:34.133 --> 10:37.200
They put those little wiggly
antennas on our heads.

10:37.266 --> 10:38.433
(doorbell rings)

10:38.500 --> 10:40.834
What will I do?
How can I face people?

10:40.900 --> 10:45.100
I told Stan I didn't want
or care about that building.

10:45.166 --> 10:46.700
I don't care about it now.

10:46.767 --> 10:49.033
He's supposed to take care
of the maintenance.

10:49.100 --> 10:51.367
You better straighten this out, Rose.

10:51.734 --> 10:54.200
-Dorothy Zbornak?
-That's me.

10:54.266 --> 10:56.934
I have a warrant for your arrest.
Come with me.

10:58.200 --> 11:01.200
-What for?
-Violation of the city's housing codes.

11:01.266 --> 11:03.633
Lady, you're a slumlord.

11:04.600 --> 11:07.166
Dorothy, don't worry.
You'll be out of jail in no time.

11:07.233 --> 11:09.900
I'll get the best attorney
social security can buy.

11:11.400 --> 11:16.300
(serene music playing)

11:16.367 --> 11:20.767
(mellow music playing)

11:21.266 --> 11:23.967
My God, Dorothy,
did you see all the reporters?

11:24.033 --> 11:29.033
-Yes. It's becoming a media circus.
-"The big bug lady," they call you.

11:30.400 --> 11:31.400
You deserve a better nickname.

11:31.467 --> 11:35.633
I don't know, something like "big mean
landlady" or "big mean Dorothy,"

11:35.700 --> 11:37.100
something with "big mean."

11:39.667 --> 11:43.834
Dorothy, I am so excited.
I just got interviewed.

11:44.400 --> 11:46.800
They asked me if you were
clean at home.

11:47.967 --> 11:50.233
I said, "Well, you won't find
any crumbs in her bed.

11:50.300 --> 11:52.300
You won't find anything in her bed."

11:57.467 --> 12:00.834
Dorothy, Dorothy, how did this happen?
I feel so terrible.

12:00.900 --> 12:03.266
-Oh, it's not your fault.
-Oh, thank you.

12:03.734 --> 12:07.467
-I'm proud of you. You didn't squeal.
-Hey, I'm a Sicilian.

12:07.934 --> 12:10.133
-Nobody made an offer, huh?
-Not a dime.

12:13.467 --> 12:15.834
Dorothy, isn't this something?

12:15.900 --> 12:19.033
You've become what we in the
news business call "a hot story."

12:19.100 --> 12:22.800
And you've become what we call
in the revenge business "next."

12:26.166 --> 12:29.433
No wonder they call you
the big mean bug lady.

12:31.600 --> 12:33.066
Do you believe that mob?

12:33.133 --> 12:34.767
-Where's Marvin?
-Who?

12:34.834 --> 12:37.233
Your lawyer, Marvin Michelson.
Where is he?

12:37.300 --> 12:40.567
-I'm not using Marvin on this.
-He's a brilliant lawyer.

12:40.633 --> 12:42.767
Listen, Stanley, we need help here.

12:42.834 --> 12:47.400
Last night after Marvin bailed us out,
it dawned on me,

12:47.467 --> 12:50.867
if we use Michelson, we'll look like the
rich slumlords we're not.

12:50.934 --> 12:55.834
-Well, then, who are we using?
-Luckily, I met somebody at the bar

12:55.900 --> 12:59.533
who doesn't have that much experience,
but I was very impressed.

13:03.734 --> 13:06.133
Boy, Stan, it's jumping out there.

13:06.200 --> 13:10.567
-Is this what impressed you?
-Believe me, Dorothy, she's very bright.

13:10.633 --> 13:11.734
Really?

13:11.800 --> 13:16.133
We were the only two in the bar
who got the jokes on the cocktail napkins.

13:18.200 --> 13:20.233
Dorothy, I want you to
meet our attorney Tracy.

13:20.300 --> 13:23.400
-Tracy, this is Dorothy.
-Hi-dee-ho!

13:25.033 --> 13:26.400
Hi-dee-ho.

13:29.600 --> 13:30.834
Stanley, forgive me,

13:30.900 --> 13:33.900
but I'm not willing to trust my future
to this girl,

13:33.967 --> 13:38.133
knowing her only qualification
is that you could pick her up in a bar.

13:38.200 --> 13:40.266
-I didn't pick her up.
-Struck out?

13:41.433 --> 13:43.500
Boy, do you know me or what?

13:44.433 --> 13:46.834
Look, this kind of thinking is
really quite sexist.

13:46.900 --> 13:50.867
Just because a woman is attractive and
isn't uncomfortable about her sexuality

13:50.934 --> 13:54.767
doesn't mean she can't be bright,
well-informed, and a hell of a lawyer.

13:58.667 --> 14:03.066
-Uh, where did you go to law school?
-A whole bunch of places.

14:07.500 --> 14:10.400
(Tracy) Uh-oh. The assistant DA,
Peterson.

14:10.934 --> 14:12.200
He's a killer.

14:12.633 --> 14:14.900
It's amazing what he does to witnesses.

14:15.233 --> 14:16.467
You think he's getting nowhere,

14:16.533 --> 14:19.533
then suddenly he gives the witness
a dumb compliment,

14:19.600 --> 14:21.133
and for some reason, it works.

14:21.200 --> 14:23.400
They let down their guard,
and he nails them.

14:23.467 --> 14:27.133
Well, you must have some way
of combating that.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.700
Well, we'll find out.

14:29.300 --> 14:30.433
What do you mean?

14:30.500 --> 14:33.266
-I've never really done this before.
-Uh-huh.

14:35.200 --> 14:38.433
So you're saying that you
never really complained

14:38.500 --> 14:41.166
about the bugs to the Zbornaks.

14:41.734 --> 14:45.367
-Is that right?
-Yes. You're very bright.

14:45.433 --> 14:47.000
She's very bright.

14:50.100 --> 14:51.500
Your witness.

14:53.900 --> 14:55.633
Angelo, isn't it true

14:55.700 --> 14:58.433
that the Zbornaks make you live under
deplorable conditions?

14:58.500 --> 14:59.633
No.

14:59.700 --> 15:01.367
Isn't it true that from time to time,

15:01.433 --> 15:05.200
they shut off the building's power
just for funsies?

15:05.266 --> 15:08.900
-No.
-Isn't it true that... excuse me.

15:08.967 --> 15:12.667
-That's the nicest tie I've ever seen.
-Thanks.

15:12.734 --> 15:15.467
Didn't you tell Rose Nylund
you lived in a slum?

15:15.533 --> 15:17.867
-Sure, but--
-No further questions.

15:20.667 --> 15:24.433
Isn't it true Mrs. Zbornak
is the kind of person

15:24.500 --> 15:27.333
-who likes seeing people suffer?
-No.

15:27.400 --> 15:31.467
Isn't it true she bullies the women
she lives with?

15:31.533 --> 15:34.533
-No!
-For the record, your honor...

15:36.166 --> 15:39.266
this witness has the most beautiful eyes
I've ever seen.

15:41.066 --> 15:46.166
Blanche, what did Dorothy really feel
about Angelo's building?

15:47.834 --> 15:51.500
She said she didn't care about it,
that she'd never cared about it.

15:55.500 --> 15:56.700
Thank you.

15:58.367 --> 15:59.567
Thank you.

16:02.066 --> 16:06.967
(serene music playing)

16:07.033 --> 16:12.066
In your own words, Mrs. Petrillo...
the words of a beautiful, dignified person

16:12.133 --> 16:14.333
who's got a wild bod for a chick her
age...

16:16.467 --> 16:21.400
-what kind of person is your daughter?
-She put me in a home.

16:26.967 --> 16:30.367
All right, quiet down.
Order in the courtroom.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
Do you have any more witnesses,
Mr. Peterson?

16:33.266 --> 16:34.467
No, your honor.

16:34.967 --> 16:37.400
-New robe?
-No. Why?

16:38.100 --> 16:40.867
-Looks great.
-Thank you, counselor.

16:44.433 --> 16:48.500
-Well, if there are no more witnesses--
-Your honor, may I say something?

16:48.567 --> 16:49.834
You may speak.

16:51.166 --> 16:53.533
Your honor, this is all
a very simple mistake.

16:53.600 --> 16:57.233
Stan and I are ready
to get an exterminator

16:57.300 --> 16:58.600
to take care of those bugs.

16:58.667 --> 17:05.166
I don't know how this thing got so far,
but believe me, we are not criminals.

17:05.233 --> 17:10.433
I want you both to find out what it's like
for all the people you collect rent from.

17:11.133 --> 17:14.900
So I'm sentencing you both
to live in apartment 3-C in this building

17:15.000 --> 17:18.400
-until it's brought up to code.
-(bangs gavel)

17:18.967 --> 17:20.066
Wait a minute. You...

17:20.133 --> 17:24.400
you want me to live with him
in the same apartment?

17:24.467 --> 17:25.667
That's right.

17:25.734 --> 17:30.533
But there are bugs there...
and they'll think Stan is their leader.

17:32.500 --> 17:38.400
(mellow music playing)

17:40.200 --> 17:41.600
All right, in you go.

17:42.667 --> 17:44.867
Oh, isn't this lovely?

17:47.033 --> 17:50.834
Look. They put in
a bunk bed and a chair.

17:51.667 --> 17:53.233
Look, Dorothy. A chair.

17:53.300 --> 17:57.367
This isn't going to be so bad.
This isn't going to be bad at all.

17:57.433 --> 17:59.767
Yeah, well, I suppose.

18:00.300 --> 18:03.300
Blanche, let's get out of here.
It's starting to get dark.

18:04.033 --> 18:05.700
In some ways, we're lucky.

18:05.767 --> 18:08.433
How many people get locked up
with someone they're attracted to?

18:08.500 --> 18:12.066
I don't know.
The name Marion Barry comes to mind.

18:14.667 --> 18:16.867
Good luck, Dorothy. I'll miss you.

18:17.367 --> 18:18.367
I love you.

18:18.834 --> 18:22.266
Someday, sweetheart,
I'm going to get out of this hellhole...

18:22.767 --> 18:25.700
and I'm going to come looking for you.

18:27.667 --> 18:30.667
Don't spend all your time in prison
hating me, Dorothy.

18:31.166 --> 18:32.500
Learn a trade.

18:36.266 --> 18:39.967
Dorothy, tonight I'm going to be out front
in a laundry truck.

18:40.033 --> 18:41.066
Gotcha.

18:41.767 --> 18:42.767
So...

18:43.467 --> 18:45.800
if you hear screaming,
don't call the cops.

18:49.934 --> 18:51.266
Okay, let's go, ladies.

18:51.333 --> 18:53.700
We won't rest till we get you out of here.

18:53.767 --> 18:54.867
Thanks, Ma.

18:56.066 --> 18:57.767
Who wants Chinese?
I got her credit card.

18:57.834 --> 18:59.300
I got her credit card.

19:00.834 --> 19:02.767
(calm music playing)

19:02.834 --> 19:08.834
(playing harmonica)

19:18.400 --> 19:20.367
I asked you not to do that.

19:20.834 --> 19:24.834
I know, but I'm going stir-crazy.
There's no way out.

19:24.900 --> 19:27.900
Stanley, they let you
keep your belt and shoelaces.

19:30.333 --> 19:31.800
Think about that.

19:33.166 --> 19:37.000
You know, in a way, this apartment reminds
me of our first place.

19:37.333 --> 19:39.333
Do you remember
the first night we spent there?

19:39.767 --> 19:44.500
Yes, and as I recall,
I was trying to read then, too.

19:45.900 --> 19:48.500
-You're still mad at me.
-Yes, I'm mad at you.

19:48.934 --> 19:51.533
Every time you come into my life,
something bad happens.

19:51.600 --> 19:54.000
Oh, you're right. You're right.

19:54.066 --> 19:59.133
I wish we could go back to the beginning,
try again in that first apartment.

19:59.200 --> 20:02.633
We didn't have much,
but we were happy to have our own place.

20:02.700 --> 20:04.266
Those were good times.

20:04.834 --> 20:07.233
You had gotten your first job.

20:07.300 --> 20:10.033
Yeah. Back then you could
give blood every week.

20:12.433 --> 20:16.834
Remember when your mother babysat?
It was our first time alone in a year.

20:16.900 --> 20:21.834
You bought me wine and flowers.
I remember.

20:21.900 --> 20:24.300
Remember how much fun
we had that night?

20:24.367 --> 20:26.767
-I remember.
-You know, Dorothy...

20:28.166 --> 20:31.700
the two of us could get into that bottom
bunk and have some fun again.

20:32.066 --> 20:34.867
What do you say, for old times' sake?

20:34.934 --> 20:36.500
I... I don't know.

20:37.200 --> 20:40.500
Oh, okay, but let's do it right.

20:40.567 --> 20:46.400
What say you run down
and buy some good wine and some flowers?

20:46.467 --> 20:48.400
Mmm. You bet.

20:58.467 --> 21:04.400
(serene music playing)

21:06.834 --> 21:07.934
Hi, Ma.

21:08.300 --> 21:10.100
My God, did you bust out?

21:10.166 --> 21:14.033
Don't worry. We'll get you
a phony license and birth certificate.

21:14.700 --> 21:17.700
I know a good plastic surgeon. By tomorrow
morning, you can be Raul Julia.

21:18.834 --> 21:20.300
No. I didn't bust out.

21:20.367 --> 21:24.100
The exterminator came this morning.
The building inspector let us leave.

21:24.600 --> 21:26.467
So... it's over.

21:26.900 --> 21:28.433
You don't sound very happy.

21:28.500 --> 21:31.166
To tell you the truth,
I'm a little confused.

21:31.233 --> 21:33.767
-About what?
-About Stan.

21:33.834 --> 21:36.767
Oh, jeez, you didn't
shack up with him again?

21:38.500 --> 21:40.066
I didn't shack up with him.

21:40.133 --> 21:41.667
He asked, and I said no,

21:41.734 --> 21:44.367
but... I'll tell you,
for a few minutes there,

21:44.433 --> 21:46.800
I thought of going to bed with him.

21:47.367 --> 21:48.867
You know who I think about
going to bed with?

21:48.934 --> 21:52.333
-I don't want to know.
-No, really--

21:52.400 --> 21:54.133
Believe me, I don't want to know.

21:54.967 --> 21:56.233
Okay, fine.

21:56.734 --> 21:57.867
But I am confused.

21:57.934 --> 22:01.266
Just when I think I'm over the man,
something happens.

22:01.333 --> 22:05.934
-Will I ever stop having feelings for him?
-Luther Vandross.

22:07.266 --> 22:08.767
Ooh, baby.

22:10.000 --> 22:13.066
-Fine. You're not interested.
-Of course I'm interested.

22:13.533 --> 22:14.934
See what I have on my feet?

22:15.900 --> 22:17.567
Your regular old shoes.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.166
And do you know why?

22:19.867 --> 22:21.800
Because old-lady shoes are me.

22:22.166 --> 22:24.700
Like it or not, they're a part of my life.

22:25.200 --> 22:26.700
It's like it is with you and Stan.

22:27.467 --> 22:29.100
You understand what I'm saying?

22:29.166 --> 22:33.834
You're saying that in some ways
Stan belongs in my life,

22:33.900 --> 22:39.700
and... like your shoes, he may not be
stylish, but he's... he's familiar,

22:39.767 --> 22:41.734
-he's comfortable.
-And shiny on top.

22:41.800 --> 22:43.200
Don't forget shiny on top.

22:44.033 --> 22:46.166
I guess that's not so bad.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.133
There you go.

22:49.133 --> 22:54.333
Ah, you know, Ma, you pick your spots,
but in some ways, you're very wise.

22:55.867 --> 22:57.600
You're not just my mother.

22:58.166 --> 22:59.600
You're my best friend.

23:00.233 --> 23:01.500
Good night, Ma.

23:03.667 --> 23:05.066
Good night, pussycat.

23:05.734 --> 23:10.266
(mellow music playing)

23:11.767 --> 23:14.100
-No.
-Please.

23:14.433 --> 23:19.967
For the last time, I am not getting you an
electric golf cart, and that's that!

23:30.633 --> 23:32.433
Hello. <i>Wake-Up! Miami?</i>

23:33.166 --> 23:36.166
The big mean bug lady,
she's at it again.
