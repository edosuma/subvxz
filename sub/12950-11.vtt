00:03.403 --> 00:05.903
<i>My name is Sydney Bristow.</i>

00:05.939 --> 00:07.539
<i>Seven years ago,
I was recruited</i>

00:07.540 --> 00:10.509
<i>by a secret branch of the CIA
called SD-6.</i>

00:10.610 --> 00:12.511
<i>I was sworn to secrecy,</i>

00:12.512 --> 00:14.313
<i>but I couldn't keep it
from my fianc√©,</i>

00:14.314 --> 00:16.715
<i>and when the head of SD-6
found out,</i>

00:16.716 --> 00:19.216
<i>he had him killed.</i>

00:19.386 --> 00:20.786
<i>That's when I learned
the truth.</i>

00:20.787 --> 00:23.055
<i>SD-6 is not part of the CIA.</i>

00:23.056 --> 00:24.790
<i>I'd been working
for the very people</i>

00:24.791 --> 00:26.725
<i>I thought
I was fighting against.</i>

00:26.726 --> 00:28.060
<i>So I went to the only place</i>

00:28.061 --> 00:29.962
<i>that could help me
take them down.</i>

00:29.963 --> 00:31.730
<i>Now I'm a double agent
for the CIA,</i>

00:31.731 --> 00:35.189
<i>where my handler
is a man named Michael Vaughn.</i>

00:36.536 --> 00:38.937
<i>Only one other person knows
the truth about what I do.</i>

00:38.938 --> 00:41.668
<i>Another double agent
inside SD-6.</i>

00:41.775 --> 00:44.275
<i>Someone I hardly know.</i>

00:44.344 --> 00:46.844
<i>My father.</i>

00:47.313 --> 00:50.441
Ineni Hassan has broken
an agreement with SD-6.

00:50.517 --> 00:52.184
He has stolen from us.

00:52.185 --> 00:54.353
Any intel about where
in Havana he might be?

00:54.354 --> 00:56.088
No. We don't know.

00:56.089 --> 00:58.589
That's why I'm sending you
to Cuba.

00:58.625 --> 01:03.289
I want Hassan dead.

01:03.363 --> 01:04.763
What's the countermission?

01:04.763 --> 01:08.894
Sloane might want Hassan dead,
but the CIA needs him alive.

01:08.968 --> 01:10.602
You're making a huge mistake,

01:10.603 --> 01:13.103
trusting a man like Hassan.

01:13.473 --> 01:16.965
They will learn what happens
when they send someone after me.

01:17.077 --> 01:19.344
Hassan has your father.

01:19.345 --> 01:20.846
Then you'll understand

01:20.847 --> 01:24.578
that I'm going to need
your help to get to Cuba.

01:26.000 --> 01:32.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:35.428 --> 01:39.694
Prove to me that you are
willing to go against SD-6.

01:39.766 --> 01:42.266
Anything.

01:55.715 --> 01:59.151
Aim the gun at this woman,
if you are who you say you are,

01:59.219 --> 02:01.719
and kill her.

02:36.756 --> 02:38.924
Shooting this agent
proves nothing.

02:38.925 --> 02:41.059
To me, it proves everything.

02:41.060 --> 02:43.927
You come to me,
and you make me an offer.

02:43.997 --> 02:47.296
You tell me that you are
willing to work against SD-6

02:47.367 --> 02:48.901
and that you're working
alone.

02:48.902 --> 02:50.802
Then she shows up.

02:50.803 --> 02:53.431
Obviously SD-6 sent her here
without my knowledge.

02:53.540 --> 02:55.807
Then you should have
no problem whatsoever

02:55.808 --> 02:58.210
proving your loyalty to me.

02:58.211 --> 03:00.045
Kill this agent.

03:00.046 --> 03:02.810
I'll believe you
and I'll accept your offer.

03:02.882 --> 03:04.683
And if you choose not to,

03:04.684 --> 03:07.585
then I'll just have to
say goodbye to both of you.

03:17.397 --> 03:19.897
Don't do it!
Hands in the air! Now!

03:23.603 --> 03:26.103
It took me a second
to realize what you were doing.

03:26.139 --> 03:28.173
I was blinking
as fast as I could.

03:28.174 --> 03:30.509
I know. It was like,
"Hard on your light. "

03:30.510 --> 03:33.010
- "Guard on your right. "
- I figured it out.

03:33.079 --> 03:35.639
I was never very good
at Morse code.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.750
Dad, you were shot.

03:38.751 --> 03:41.186
It's nothing.

03:41.187 --> 03:43.555
Call your guards.
Have them meet out back.

03:43.556 --> 03:44.890
We're going out the front.

03:44.891 --> 03:46.892
We're fluent in Arabic,
so just do as I say.

04:27.367 --> 04:29.835
So, now what?

04:29.836 --> 04:31.803
Take me to the mountains
and kill me?

04:31.804 --> 04:33.272
The plan doesn't change.

04:33.273 --> 04:35.274
You're gonna give me
your client list.

04:35.275 --> 04:37.775
I'm gonna make sure
SD-6 thinks you're dead.

04:42.015 --> 04:46.577
I don't care who you work for,
as long as you let me go.

04:57.497 --> 04:59.997
Okay. Get up.

05:04.604 --> 05:06.505
Do you know how much
this suit cost me?

05:06.506 --> 05:09.006
- It's not cheap.
- Give me your client list.

05:15.615 --> 05:18.115
There you are.

05:18.651 --> 05:22.178
You said you had a way
for me to get out of Cuba.

05:23.056 --> 05:25.556
Oh. Yes, I do.

05:31.164 --> 05:33.031
Two years ago...

05:33.032 --> 05:37.560
of course, I knew you were
working for SD-6...

05:37.670 --> 05:40.571
I heard you'd been sent
to Memphis, Egypt,

05:40.640 --> 05:43.165
to meet with this jackass.

05:43.276 --> 05:45.677
It turned my stomach
that you were in this business.

05:45.678 --> 05:48.178
Come here.

05:58.791 --> 06:01.126
I think you've got
a lacerated blood vessel.

06:01.127 --> 06:03.627
I'm all right.

06:05.398 --> 06:07.898
Dad, can I ask you something?

06:08.668 --> 06:11.036
When you started with SD-6,

06:11.037 --> 06:13.972
you knew that they were
a mercenary group

06:14.040 --> 06:17.305
and that they had no connection
with the CIA.

06:18.578 --> 06:20.078
But I didn't.

06:20.079 --> 06:22.080
When I joined...

06:22.081 --> 06:24.743
I thought I was gonna be
saving the world.

06:24.817 --> 06:27.317
Not making it
more dangerous.

06:28.654 --> 06:31.154
What's the question?

06:33.793 --> 06:36.293
Why didn't you say something?

06:38.164 --> 06:42.225
You could've told me
what I was really doing.

06:42.301 --> 06:44.801
Damage instead of good.

06:46.005 --> 06:48.505
But you kept quiet.

06:51.411 --> 06:54.574
Revealing the truth
about what you were doing

06:54.647 --> 06:57.147
would have required
revealing the truth

06:57.150 --> 06:59.650
about what I was doing.

07:41.661 --> 07:44.161
I'll see you.

07:44.964 --> 07:47.464
Okay.

07:57.610 --> 07:59.845
As Hassan and I
were heading to the mainland,

07:59.846 --> 08:02.474
my dad contacted SD-6
and told them

08:02.548 --> 08:05.881
that Hassan was dead and that
his mission was a success.

08:06.953 --> 08:08.553
So it all worked.

08:08.554 --> 08:10.722
SD-6 has no idea
I was gone.

08:10.723 --> 08:14.625
The CIA has Hassan,
and my dad's okay.

08:15.995 --> 08:17.329
So thank you.

08:17.330 --> 08:18.797
I didn't do anything.

08:18.798 --> 08:21.298
You got me into Cuba.

08:23.202 --> 08:25.762
And you know what?
You were right.

08:25.872 --> 08:28.372
What about?

08:29.308 --> 08:33.073
What happens when someone
you care about is in trouble.

08:34.013 --> 08:38.279
Nothing else matters.
It all just goes away.

08:38.351 --> 08:41.376
Last week, when I learned
what my father did for me.

08:41.453 --> 08:45.322
Sacrificing Russek.
It made me sick.

08:46.192 --> 08:48.956
But now I know...

08:49.028 --> 08:52.293
I would have done
exactly the same thing.

08:55.134 --> 08:57.634
You should have seen him.

08:58.137 --> 08:59.304
Your father?

08:59.305 --> 09:02.706
Yeah, he was like a pro.
He was good.

09:02.808 --> 09:04.876
The way you talked
about him once,

09:04.877 --> 09:08.472
what his reputation is,
I could see it in action.

09:08.548 --> 09:11.676
He was impressive.

09:14.720 --> 09:17.220
I got those codes deciphered.

09:18.991 --> 09:21.491
Those books your father
used to buy for your mother.

09:21.494 --> 09:23.994
The ones he had imported
25 years ago.

09:26.065 --> 09:29.034
Those Cyrillic codes
you found and gave to me...

09:29.101 --> 09:31.601
I had NSA look at them.

09:32.738 --> 09:35.263
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

09:50.122 --> 09:52.290
What is this?

09:52.291 --> 09:55.920
Directives.
Confirmed KGB orders.

09:55.995 --> 09:58.096
What kind of orders?
What do they mean?

09:59.432 --> 10:02.765
It's a list of aliases,
of handles.

10:02.835 --> 10:04.636
People.

10:04.637 --> 10:05.637
Who?

10:05.638 --> 10:08.732
Those are official code names
given by the CIA

10:08.841 --> 10:12.641
to over a dozen of our officers,
all of whom were killed.

10:14.180 --> 10:15.180
What?

10:15.181 --> 10:16.781
25 years ago.

10:16.782 --> 10:18.883
All killed by an unknown
foreign agent.

10:18.884 --> 10:21.751
An agent the CIA suspected
was KGB.

10:23.189 --> 10:26.022
Your suspicions
about your father

10:26.092 --> 10:30.051
having once worked
for the KGB are accurate.

10:30.129 --> 10:31.396
We don't know for sure.

10:31.397 --> 10:33.922
Your father was being tracked
by an FBI counterintelligence.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.166
You said that was routine.

10:35.167 --> 10:37.068
There's nothing routine
about that list.

10:37.069 --> 10:39.833
There is something
very specific about it.

10:39.939 --> 10:42.307
It's been a mystery
within the agency

10:42.308 --> 10:45.675
for over two decades,
who murdered those CIA officers.

10:46.512 --> 10:50.539
I'm sorry,
but we have our answer now.

10:51.283 --> 10:53.783
It was your father.

10:55.888 --> 10:58.618
I'm gonna report him.

11:32.425 --> 11:34.559
I'm glad you're back safely.

11:34.560 --> 11:37.893
To tell you the truth,
I was a little nervous.

11:37.963 --> 11:40.231
I've been through far worse
than Havana.

11:40.232 --> 11:41.232
We both have.

11:41.233 --> 11:42.567
Yeah.

11:42.568 --> 11:44.102
When I didn't hear from you,

11:44.103 --> 11:46.765
I thought maybe Hassan
had gotten a lead.

11:46.872 --> 11:48.740
Maybe he knew you were coming.

11:48.741 --> 11:52.177
I was unsure of that myself,
but it all worked out.

11:53.779 --> 11:55.747
Not for Hassan.

11:55.748 --> 11:58.248
No, not for him.

12:00.119 --> 12:01.453
Thank you.

12:01.454 --> 12:03.788
It's my job.

12:03.789 --> 12:05.557
A vicious murder.

12:05.558 --> 12:08.058
Ineni Hassan has been executed.

12:08.094 --> 12:10.824
We may never know who's
responsible for this killing,

12:10.896 --> 12:12.764
but what we do know is

12:12.765 --> 12:14.733
that after word
of Hassan's death spread,

12:14.734 --> 12:16.735
this man was unusually busy.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.970
This is Minos Sakulos.

12:18.971 --> 12:21.531
He worked very closely
with Hassan.

12:21.640 --> 12:23.942
Some considered him
to be Hassan's second.

12:23.943 --> 12:26.810
For the past two days,
Sakulos has been scrambling

12:26.879 --> 12:29.404
to make contact
with Hassan's old clients.

12:29.482 --> 12:32.212
Seems he's looking to take over
Hassan's work.

12:32.284 --> 12:34.784
Do you think Sakulos
had Hassan killed?

12:35.287 --> 12:37.222
Perhaps.

12:37.223 --> 12:40.420
Or maybe he's just taking
advantage of an opportunity.

12:40.493 --> 12:42.460
We intercepted this call
last night.

12:42.461 --> 12:44.462
I know that before his death,

12:44.463 --> 12:46.030
you were in talks
with Mr. Hassan.

12:46.031 --> 12:48.966
Yes, it was a discussion
of a certain package.

12:49.034 --> 12:51.302
I'm in possession
of this package myself.

12:51.303 --> 12:53.238
I'm taking bids right now.

12:53.239 --> 12:54.572
A package?

12:54.573 --> 12:56.407
Yes, a package.

12:56.408 --> 12:58.409
For months
we've been hearing rumors

12:58.410 --> 13:00.712
about a new device
that Hassan had commissioned.

13:00.713 --> 13:03.580
We don't know what it is,
but Hassan was an arms dealer

13:03.649 --> 13:06.243
with access to nuclear weapons,
so we need to know.

13:06.318 --> 13:08.319
This is Club Panthera.

13:08.320 --> 13:11.915
It's Sakulos' cover.
He keeps an office there.

13:11.991 --> 13:15.256
Sakulos has set up a meeting
with potential clients

13:15.327 --> 13:17.729
Thursday night at this club.

13:17.730 --> 13:19.731
Your job is to go to Greece,

13:19.732 --> 13:22.895
break into Sakulos' office,
and retrieve the specs

13:22.968 --> 13:25.136
on this mysterious package.

13:25.137 --> 13:26.204
Marshall.

13:26.205 --> 13:27.272
Thank you.

13:27.273 --> 13:29.574
Actually, before I...

13:29.575 --> 13:32.075
Did anyone see
that documentary on monkeys

13:32.178 --> 13:34.646
last night on...
It was great.

13:34.647 --> 13:37.147
They did this sign...

13:38.150 --> 13:41.085
No one saw that.

13:41.153 --> 13:43.221
What we've learned so far

13:43.222 --> 13:45.816
is that Sakulos has
a biometric access panel

13:45.891 --> 13:46.891
on his office door

13:46.892 --> 13:50.350
which requires a retinal scan
in order to open.

13:50.429 --> 13:55.025
So you have the high-resolution
retina scanners.

13:55.100 --> 13:56.768
They work from up to
about 30 feet.

13:56.769 --> 14:00.398
Now, Miss Bristow...
you'll put these on like so

14:00.506 --> 14:03.566
and find the person
whose retina you want.

14:03.676 --> 14:06.873
You want to make direct,
solid eye contact with him.

14:06.946 --> 14:08.279
Look him right in the...

14:08.280 --> 14:10.148
And then, Mr. Dixon...

14:10.149 --> 14:14.483
you will lock on
and hit the scan key.

14:14.553 --> 14:17.053
It should take
about 10 seconds.

14:17.089 --> 14:18.489
I know that's kind of
a long time,

14:18.490 --> 14:21.186
but check this out.

14:21.260 --> 14:26.095
This is a silicone
and fluoropolymer compound.

14:26.165 --> 14:27.999
Creates a set
of contact lenses

14:28.000 --> 14:30.992
that the retina reader
will accept.

14:31.103 --> 14:35.403
You guys got to check out
that documentary on monkeys.

14:35.474 --> 14:36.507
It's...

14:36.508 --> 14:39.008
I got a copy at home if...

14:56.495 --> 14:58.995
Not so bad here, is it?

14:59.031 --> 15:01.531
This is not the deal
I agreed to.

15:06.872 --> 15:10.638
So, what can you tell me
about the package?

15:11.877 --> 15:13.711
You're gonna have to
help me out.

15:13.712 --> 15:17.148
Under the Patriot Act of 2001,
you're not going anywhere.

15:17.216 --> 15:19.716
What I recommend is that
you and I work together,

15:19.718 --> 15:21.085
and I'll make sure
you stay comfortable.

15:21.086 --> 15:24.249
There are some incredibly nice
prisons in this country.

15:24.323 --> 15:27.815
Either that, or you don't
cooperate, in which case,

15:27.893 --> 15:30.393
you're not gonna like
your cellmate so much.

15:30.429 --> 15:32.096
You don't have to trust me,

15:32.097 --> 15:34.332
but it might save you
some misery.

15:34.333 --> 15:36.833
What's the package?

15:39.672 --> 15:42.172
Listen.

15:42.675 --> 15:44.676
I have a wife and a son.

15:44.677 --> 15:47.703
They are targets.
Not just SD-6.

15:47.780 --> 15:50.647
I've made many enemies
in the past.

15:50.716 --> 15:53.151
You bring them
to the United States.

15:53.152 --> 15:54.752
Give them protection.

15:54.753 --> 15:56.421
You do that for me,

15:56.422 --> 15:58.556
and I'll tell you
whatever you want to know.

15:58.557 --> 16:01.057
Everything.

16:02.394 --> 16:04.894
Let me make one thing
very clear, Mr. Hassan.

16:04.897 --> 16:07.031
The extent to which
I am willing to service you

16:07.032 --> 16:08.566
is when I offer you a soda.

16:08.567 --> 16:10.268
There is no room
for negotiations.

16:10.269 --> 16:12.003
There are no perks
coming your way.

16:12.004 --> 16:13.371
You have nothing
to gain here.

16:13.372 --> 16:15.006
Then neither do you.

16:15.007 --> 16:16.641
- Think about that.
- I don't have to.

16:16.642 --> 16:19.509
I'll give you some time
to think about that.

16:23.048 --> 16:25.548
Sydney...

16:34.660 --> 16:39.222
In Cuba,
I should have said that...

16:42.368 --> 16:46.600
I wanted to say
thank you for coming.

16:46.705 --> 16:49.640
I know that was something
that you...

16:49.708 --> 16:52.438
that you certainly
didn't have to do.

16:52.511 --> 16:54.345
It's okay, Dad.

16:54.346 --> 16:55.847
Wait.

16:55.848 --> 16:58.348
There's something else.

17:03.055 --> 17:05.555
There are...

17:07.226 --> 17:10.718
There are
so many things that

17:10.796 --> 17:13.560
I should probably do.

17:13.632 --> 17:16.132
I mean, as a father.

17:18.103 --> 17:22.300
Things I should ask and say.

17:24.143 --> 17:26.667
Dad...

17:26.779 --> 17:29.279
it's all right.

17:29.982 --> 17:32.482
Really.

17:46.899 --> 17:49.459
Whatever the package is,
Hassan's not talking.

17:49.535 --> 17:52.035
Here's the plan. You'll
put on the contact lenses,

17:52.071 --> 17:54.505
get into Sakulos' office,
and record the specs.

17:54.506 --> 17:57.006
You. Not Dixon.

17:57.476 --> 18:00.877
The compact's a camera.
The lipstick's a voice recorder.

18:00.979 --> 18:03.014
The lighter's
a USB flash R.A.M. Drive.

18:03.015 --> 18:06.382
Whatever info you can get,
get it for us.

18:10.489 --> 18:13.788
These are some unclassified
designs for various weapons.

18:13.859 --> 18:17.056
You'll photograph these with
whatever camera SD-6 gives you.

18:17.129 --> 18:19.654
That's what you'll give them
when you get back.

18:19.731 --> 18:21.299
Thanks.

18:21.300 --> 18:23.434
Listen, about your father...

18:23.435 --> 18:26.302
I know you're reluctant
to do anything.

18:26.405 --> 18:28.005
I've been thinking a lot
about that.

18:28.006 --> 18:29.340
You know what we have to do.

18:29.341 --> 18:31.109
We have to report him
to Langley.

18:31.110 --> 18:33.610
Now, I could do it myself,
but those are your books.

18:33.645 --> 18:36.145
They'll need your testimony
to make a case against him.

18:36.148 --> 18:38.216
He might have been
part of the KGB,

18:38.217 --> 18:40.879
but we don't know what role
he played in those murders.

18:40.953 --> 18:42.653
You're kidding yourself.

18:42.654 --> 18:45.521
Let's say he was guilty.
The directives are 25 years old.

18:45.591 --> 18:48.424
There is no statute
of limitation on murder.

18:50.796 --> 18:52.597
We need him right now.

18:52.598 --> 18:55.590
We will never destroy SD-6
without my father.

19:09.148 --> 19:12.584
Those code names in your
father's books were people.

19:12.651 --> 19:15.745
They risked their lives,
all of them, for this country.

19:15.821 --> 19:18.790
Yes, it might have been
25 years ago,

19:18.857 --> 19:23.123
but for each of those lives
lost, others were destroyed.

19:23.195 --> 19:24.529
- I know.
- You don't know.

19:24.530 --> 19:26.030
You're not thinking about them.

19:26.031 --> 19:27.698
You're only thinking
of yourself.

19:27.699 --> 19:29.600
You made a connection
with your father

19:29.601 --> 19:31.002
for the first time.

19:31.003 --> 19:33.503
Turning him in
would mean sacrificing that.

19:33.539 --> 19:36.235
I understand.
But, Sydney, we have proof.

19:36.341 --> 19:37.675
We know who the victims are.

19:37.676 --> 19:39.010
You're holding them
in your hands.

19:39.011 --> 19:41.245
We know who the killer was.

19:41.246 --> 19:44.113
And we both know
the right thing to do.

19:48.954 --> 19:53.948
Yes, my father probably got
his KGB orders from the books.

19:54.026 --> 19:58.224
And, yes, it looks like...

19:58.297 --> 20:01.391
my father was responsible
for those deaths.

20:01.466 --> 20:03.966
But what you're asking me
to do...

20:05.070 --> 20:07.071
I just need some time.

20:07.072 --> 20:09.507
Not a lot of time.
Not forever.

20:09.508 --> 20:12.008
Just...

20:13.045 --> 20:15.545
Please.

20:17.916 --> 20:20.578
You won't do anything
about this without me.

20:54.820 --> 20:57.345
Yes, my father probably got

20:57.422 --> 20:59.757
his KGB orders from the books.

20:59.758 --> 21:04.422
And, yes, it looks like...

21:04.496 --> 21:08.023
my father was responsible
for those deaths.

21:33.825 --> 21:36.027
I'm gonna need
another set of eyes.

21:36.028 --> 21:38.528
I'm working on it.

21:55.013 --> 21:56.847
I'm in.

21:56.848 --> 21:59.348
Give me a second
to locate Sakulos.

22:00.886 --> 22:03.154
Okay. Found him.

22:04.156 --> 22:06.681
He's through the glass door
to your left.

22:57.109 --> 22:58.876
He's looking right at me.

22:58.877 --> 23:00.811
You got anything yet?

23:00.812 --> 23:02.713
I'm not getting a lock
on the retinas.

23:02.714 --> 23:04.849
The lights must be
disrupting the signal.

23:04.850 --> 23:07.478
- You'll have to get closer.
- How much closer?

23:07.552 --> 23:10.350
In this lighting,
how's 2 inches?

23:10.422 --> 23:12.922
Great.

23:26.071 --> 23:28.105
I understand
you're the owner of the club.

23:28.106 --> 23:30.274
Well, you are American.

23:30.275 --> 23:32.009
That's right.
God bless America.

23:32.010 --> 23:34.510
I'm getting it, Syd.
Hold him for 10 seconds.

23:37.783 --> 23:41.219
Your dancers suck.

23:41.787 --> 23:44.121
Suck?

23:44.122 --> 23:46.023
You think you could do
a better job?

23:47.759 --> 23:48.959
Sir...

23:48.960 --> 23:52.020
your 11:00 just arrived.

23:52.097 --> 23:53.964
He's waiting
by the poolside bar.

23:53.965 --> 23:55.933
No good.
We didn't get a read yet.

23:55.934 --> 23:59.165
I have a very important
meeting with a client.

24:00.605 --> 24:03.836
But follow me.

24:22.227 --> 24:24.991
I'll be back in 10 minutes.

24:29.067 --> 24:30.468
I can't wait.

24:31.970 --> 24:34.470
Got it.

24:42.614 --> 24:45.674
The contacts are ready, Syd.
Meet me by the restrooms.

24:45.750 --> 24:47.918
Excuse me. I have to go.

24:47.919 --> 24:50.154
Mr. Sakulos has invited you
to stay.

24:50.155 --> 24:51.989
I need a drink.

24:51.990 --> 24:54.258
We will be happy to have
whatever you like brought here.

24:54.259 --> 24:55.659
I'd rather get it myself.

24:55.660 --> 24:58.857
I think you will be much more
comfortable if you stay here.

24:58.930 --> 24:59.930
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

24:59.931 --> 25:02.431
Do you?

25:03.802 --> 25:04.969
You okay?

25:04.970 --> 25:07.803
Yeah, except I'm locked
in this pervert's room.

25:11.109 --> 25:14.408
I'm closer to Sakulos' office,
and I have the contacts.

25:14.479 --> 25:16.447
No, Dixon, I really want to
do this myself.

25:16.448 --> 25:18.916
I'll download the blueprints
of the package

25:18.917 --> 25:20.651
from Sakulos' computer.

25:20.652 --> 25:21.819
No, Dixon...

25:21.820 --> 25:23.454
Just get out in one piece.

25:23.455 --> 25:25.823
I'll meet you outside
when I'm done.

25:25.824 --> 25:28.324
Damn it.

26:26.685 --> 26:29.313
Are you auditioning
to be a dancer, eh?

26:29.387 --> 26:31.887
Or a bouncer, eh?

26:38.096 --> 26:40.097
Hmm.

26:40.098 --> 26:43.192
I can't quite decide
if you are my taste.

26:47.505 --> 26:50.005
Sydney!

26:54.879 --> 26:57.379
Syd, let's go.

27:18.770 --> 27:21.270
How's the food?

27:24.609 --> 27:28.375
So, Mr. Hassan, you've had
some time to think about it.

27:28.446 --> 27:30.946
- Do you want to help me out?
- Screw you.

27:30.949 --> 27:33.017
- Screw me.
- Screw you.

27:33.018 --> 27:35.285
I don't talk to you
unless you show me some respect.

27:35.286 --> 27:36.887
Let's be honest here.

27:36.888 --> 27:38.589
In 20 minutes,
you're gonna be shipped off

27:38.590 --> 27:41.025
to a maximum-security prison
outside Los Angeles.

27:41.026 --> 27:44.120
By 5:00 p. m., you're gonna be
someone's after-dinner mint.

27:44.195 --> 27:46.630
Unless you start
cooperating with me real fast,

27:46.631 --> 27:49.964
respect is gonna be
the least of your problems.

27:56.107 --> 27:58.607
Wait.

27:59.177 --> 28:02.738
You still refuse to help get
my family out of Argentina.

28:02.814 --> 28:05.314
I told you,
that's not part of the deal.

28:05.350 --> 28:07.251
But if you help me out,

28:07.252 --> 28:09.777
I'll make sure
you stay comfortable.

28:09.854 --> 28:12.354
Okay.

28:12.857 --> 28:15.724
I have a stockpile of weapons,
not in Egypt.

28:15.794 --> 28:18.294
I knew that's where
my enemies would look.

28:19.064 --> 28:24.297
The package and other weapons
are in a silo in Greece,

28:24.369 --> 28:26.403
on the Isle of Crete.

28:28.606 --> 28:31.439
- He licked my face.
- I understand.

28:31.509 --> 28:33.977
You don't really.
He licked my face.

28:33.978 --> 28:35.879
And you want to know
the worst part?

28:35.880 --> 28:36.847
I didn't succeed.

28:36.848 --> 28:39.283
Because of him,
Dixon accessed the information.

28:39.284 --> 28:41.085
The CIA got nothing.

28:41.086 --> 28:43.454
SD-6 ended up
with what they wanted.

28:43.455 --> 28:45.589
I want to go to Crete myself.

28:45.590 --> 28:48.525
I want to find the stockpile
Hassan told you about,

28:48.593 --> 28:49.860
get the package,
and bring it back.

28:49.861 --> 28:51.361
I just don't feel
it's the right time

28:51.362 --> 28:53.956
for the CIA to send you anywhere
without SD-6's knowledge.

28:54.032 --> 28:56.796
We just did that with Cuba.
I think it's too dangerous.

28:56.868 --> 28:59.303
We can use my father.
He can give Sloane the intel.

28:59.304 --> 29:01.804
We'll make it an SD-6 mission.

29:02.407 --> 29:04.907
Okay.

29:06.010 --> 29:08.510
That's not why I called you.

29:09.380 --> 29:11.880
I know.

29:12.817 --> 29:17.880
Listen,
if we turn in my father...

29:17.956 --> 29:20.324
that'll jeopardize
what you and I are doing.

29:20.325 --> 29:24.989
Yes, my father probably got
his KGB orders from the books.

29:25.063 --> 29:27.896
And, yes, it looks like...

29:27.966 --> 29:31.163
my father was responsible
for those deaths.

29:38.676 --> 29:41.941
I figured turning in your father
would be too difficult for you,

29:42.013 --> 29:44.381
so I made this tape
last time we were together.

29:44.382 --> 29:45.883
I was gonna play it for Devlin.

29:45.884 --> 29:47.918
Maybe use it in court someday.

29:47.919 --> 29:50.419
But I couldn't bring myself
to do that.

29:56.161 --> 29:58.495
I'm only telling you this...

29:58.496 --> 30:02.626
because I thought I owed you
that for some reason.

30:06.104 --> 30:08.698
I know this is
a personal thing for you.

30:08.807 --> 30:11.537
The idea of reporting
your father

30:11.609 --> 30:14.544
is a horrible position
to be in.

30:17.081 --> 30:19.606
But it's a personal thing
for me, too, Sydney.

30:21.419 --> 30:23.554
Those files I showed you

30:23.555 --> 30:26.217
of the CIA officers
who were killed...

30:31.095 --> 30:33.595
I left one out.

30:52.317 --> 30:56.048
I made an appointment
to meet with Devlin on Monday

30:56.120 --> 30:58.620
to report your father.

31:00.992 --> 31:03.492
Are you with me?

31:06.865 --> 31:11.632
<i># There's a saying old,
says that love is blind #</i>

31:11.703 --> 31:17.505
<i># Still we're often told,
seek and you shall find #</i>

31:17.575 --> 31:21.841
<i># So I'm going to seek
a certain girl #</i>

31:21.913 --> 31:28.682
<i># I've had in mind #</i>

31:28.753 --> 31:33.690
<i># There's a somebody
I'm longing to see #</i>

31:36.060 --> 31:38.495
Hey.

31:38.496 --> 31:39.796
Hey, what's up?

31:39.797 --> 31:41.331
Is Jenny here?

31:41.332 --> 31:43.267
What?

31:43.268 --> 31:46.260
Oh. No.

31:46.337 --> 31:48.837
Come on in.

31:53.177 --> 31:57.511
<i># I'm a little lamb
who's lost in the wood #</i>

31:59.083 --> 32:01.583
What's wrong?

32:05.690 --> 32:08.190
Hey.

32:10.428 --> 32:12.988
Hey, come here.

32:13.064 --> 32:18.366
<i># Although I may not be
the man #</i>

32:18.436 --> 32:24.864
<i># Some girls think of
as handsome #</i>

32:24.943 --> 32:31.610
<i># To her heart,
I'll carry the key #</i>

32:31.683 --> 32:34.183
Can you tell me what's wrong?

32:40.758 --> 32:45.422
I just want to stay here
for a while if that's okay.

32:50.101 --> 32:52.601
Of course.

33:13.091 --> 33:15.855
<i>Dad, I know
you've made mistakes.</i>

33:15.927 --> 33:17.060
<i>We both have.</i>

33:17.061 --> 33:18.895
<i>And I know that,
given the chance,</i>

33:18.896 --> 33:21.831
<i>you'd go back
and take a different path.</i>

33:21.899 --> 33:24.561
<i>That you'd right
the things you did wrong.</i>

33:27.605 --> 33:30.165
<i>My point is,
something went wrong last week.</i>

33:30.274 --> 33:33.505
<i>I have the chance to correct
it, but I need your help.</i>

33:33.578 --> 33:35.212
<i>Please.</i>

33:35.213 --> 33:37.977
<i>You have to make Sloane believe
that you've received intel</i>

33:38.049 --> 33:40.882
<i>about Hassan's
weapons stockpile.</i>

33:43.888 --> 33:47.153
Arvin, I just received
some intel.

33:47.759 --> 33:50.353
I think we have the location
of Hassan's weapons stockpile.

33:50.428 --> 33:52.262
You're looking
at an E.M. Refractor,

33:52.263 --> 33:53.730
used to cloak missiles.

33:53.731 --> 33:55.565
It's being stored
on the island of Crete.

33:55.566 --> 33:58.501
Thanks to your father's
Middle-Eastern contacts,

33:58.569 --> 33:59.936
we know where to go.

33:59.937 --> 34:02.437
Good work.

34:05.410 --> 34:08.174
You go to Marshall.
He'll review the op tech.

34:08.246 --> 34:10.746
- You'll leave in the morning.
- Okay.

34:40.645 --> 34:42.779
Sakulos is leaving
the bunker.

34:42.780 --> 34:44.947
We've got him
on satellite relay, Syd.

34:44.949 --> 34:46.349
See any guards?

34:46.350 --> 34:47.951
Hassan says there won't be any.

34:47.952 --> 34:49.985
The building was designed
to look abandoned.

34:49.987 --> 34:52.456
The E.M. Refractor is
in a secure depot underground.

34:52.456 --> 34:54.956
Copy that.

35:04.535 --> 35:07.035
Go infrared.

35:09.740 --> 35:12.075
It's clear.

35:12.076 --> 35:14.576
Syd, you're clear.

35:22.653 --> 35:25.153
Okay, I'm in.

35:25.189 --> 35:26.456
Where to?

35:26.457 --> 35:28.091
There's
a stairwell on your left.

35:28.092 --> 35:30.592
Go down to the lower level.

35:37.969 --> 35:39.936
It's a dead end.

35:39.937 --> 35:42.701
There is a valve
halfway up on the left.

35:42.807 --> 35:44.541
She needs to turn it clockwise.

35:44.542 --> 35:46.076
Syd, turn to your left.

35:46.077 --> 35:48.545
There's a valve.
Turn it clockwise.

35:48.546 --> 35:50.347
Copy.

35:50.348 --> 35:53.181
A panel will open.
She'll find a keypad behind it.

35:53.251 --> 35:55.751
You should find a keypad.

36:00.858 --> 36:02.225
What's the code?

36:02.226 --> 36:04.726
The code.

36:05.263 --> 36:07.763
Pi to six digits.

36:08.332 --> 36:11.062
The code is 314159.

36:34.192 --> 36:36.626
Where do I look?

36:36.627 --> 36:40.256
Hassan says to look
for black shipping cases.

36:58.683 --> 37:00.850
I found the refractor.

37:07.692 --> 37:09.693
Vaughn,
I think this is a setup.

37:12.763 --> 37:16.529
Vaughn, what's going on?
The room went into lockdown.

37:16.601 --> 37:18.568
What the hell
did you just do?

37:18.569 --> 37:20.604
I gave you the wrong code.

37:20.605 --> 37:24.473
Your agent has activated
an anti-intruder device.

37:33.451 --> 37:35.518
In a few seconds...

37:35.519 --> 37:37.921
the room will be filled
with gasoline.

37:37.922 --> 37:42.450
Exactly one minute after that,
a flame will ignite.

37:44.295 --> 37:46.630
Vaughn, talk to me.

37:46.631 --> 37:49.131
Give me
the deactivation code.

37:52.103 --> 37:53.136
Vaughn!

37:53.137 --> 37:56.538
Not until I have
an agreement in writing

37:56.607 --> 37:58.174
signed by your superiors

37:58.175 --> 38:01.542
guaranteeing that my family
will be allowed entrance

38:01.612 --> 38:04.137
into your
witness-protection program.

38:04.215 --> 38:08.083
Give me the code, you son of a
bitch, or I'll pull the trigger.

38:08.152 --> 38:10.652
I have no doubt that's true.

38:16.460 --> 38:18.960
- Start typing.
- Me?

38:37.581 --> 38:39.115
You misspelled "Ineni. "

38:39.116 --> 38:41.616
Shut up.

38:42.320 --> 38:44.387
- Sorry, Mr. Devlin.
- What are you doing?

38:44.388 --> 38:46.056
If I don't get your signature
on a protection order

38:46.057 --> 38:48.024
for Ineni Hassan's family
in the next 40 seconds,

38:48.025 --> 38:50.525
Sydney Bristow will die.

39:11.716 --> 39:14.216
Come on. Come on.

39:18.522 --> 39:21.022
Give me the code.

39:23.227 --> 39:29.063
766153.

39:29.133 --> 39:33.331
The code is 766153.

39:44.382 --> 39:46.882
Vaughn, thank you.

39:51.856 --> 39:54.290
Don't shoot.
The room is full of gasoline.

39:58.262 --> 40:00.762
What the hell are you doing?

40:47.411 --> 40:49.179
You're amazing.

40:49.180 --> 40:50.580
I am not amazing.

40:50.581 --> 40:53.081
You did a great job.

40:59.590 --> 41:02.491
You sure you're ready
to meet with Devlin?

41:02.560 --> 41:04.694
Yeah.

41:04.695 --> 41:06.329
Okay.

41:06.330 --> 41:08.364
A taxi will pick you up at 3:00.

41:08.365 --> 41:10.366
Northwest corner
of Westwood and Wilshire.

41:10.367 --> 41:14.326
They'll get you into the agency
through the underground garage.

41:15.506 --> 41:18.006
Okay.

41:32.656 --> 41:35.156
You sure you're all right?

41:46.437 --> 41:48.304
It's a big meeting.

41:48.305 --> 41:50.805
I know. I don't get it.

42:15.499 --> 42:18.935
This is CIA Director Devlin,
Deputy Director Tucker,

42:19.003 --> 42:20.537
Executive Director Gerstner,

42:20.538 --> 42:23.974
and these are Senior Officers
Haley, Stafford, and Collum.

42:27.811 --> 42:31.406
I knew weeks ago
that my file had been pulled

42:31.482 --> 42:35.009
and that you were suspicious
of my activities 25 years ago

42:35.085 --> 42:37.585
regarding the KGB.

42:37.821 --> 42:40.551
When I learned you had scheduled
a meeting with Mr. Devlin

42:40.624 --> 42:44.185
regarding my history...

42:44.261 --> 42:45.962
I knew that it was time.

42:45.963 --> 42:47.797
Let me say in advance

42:47.798 --> 42:50.767
I'm sorry to make this
such a public display,

42:50.834 --> 42:53.701
but I felt it was important to
do this in front of these people

42:53.804 --> 42:56.172
because they already know
the truth

42:56.173 --> 43:01.406
and because I didn't think that
you would believe me otherwise.

43:03.447 --> 43:07.281
Those Cyrillic codes
you found in those books...

43:07.351 --> 43:10.115
Yes, they were orders
from the KGB.

43:10.187 --> 43:14.556
And, yes,
they were orders to kill.

43:14.625 --> 43:19.187
An agent received those orders
and carried them out.

43:19.263 --> 43:22.721
Murdered officers of the CIA.

43:22.800 --> 43:25.300
Including your father,
Mr. Vaughn.

43:27.805 --> 43:30.305
All this is true.

43:31.141 --> 43:34.201
But, Sydney,
I was not that agent.

43:38.716 --> 43:41.216
Your mother was.
