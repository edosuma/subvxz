We don't want to
rush into anything.

You're young.

02:13.634 --> 02:15.467
You got your whole life
ahead of you.

02:15.469 --> 02:17.636
Why rush?

sentence for Freddie, all right?

02:46.867 --> 02:51.336
Listen, Cindy, she's had me
on decaf the last few weeks,

02:51.338 --> 02:53.906

the real stuff before it's gone.

Yeah, yeah, okay.

Hey, I'll let you know
if anything else comes up.

03:03.650 --> 03:05.717
- What is it, Chief?
- I assume you two have heard

03:05.719 --> 03:07.719
about the weather down south?

03:07.721 --> 03:09.621
- Yeah, I got an aunt
down in Carbondale.

03:09.623 --> 03:11.890
She said a tornado hit
couple hours ago.

03:11.892 --> 03:13.859
- Well, I've just had an update
from the district chief.

03:13.861 --> 03:16.195
They have no idea where
the storm is headed,

03:16.197 --> 03:17.796

on tornado watch

might hit here?

we can still be friends.

Actually, no.

to be friends with you?

Just so you can feel better?

04:01.242 --> 04:02.374
- That's not what I meant.

04:02.376 --> 04:03.508

broke up with me

lieutenant told you to.

you do whatever he says,

you needed to say.

She's been acting
erratic lately.

40:21.119 --> 40:24.154
I'm not sure how much longer
Boden's gonna put up with it.

40:24.156 --> 40:26.656
- Really? Think he'd cut
her a little slack,

40:26.658 --> 40:29.692
after all she's been through.

40:29.694 --> 40:31.828
- What's that mean?
- Jelly Bean.

40:31.830 --> 40:34.731
Chili's sister.

40:34.733 --> 40:36.566
They found her body
a few weeks ago

40:36.568 --> 40:38.968
in a flop house
in Kansas City.

40:43.674 --> 40:45.708
<i>- I'm--I'm not a rat.</i>

40:45.710 --> 40:47.110
- You did the right thing.

40:48.579 --> 40:49.879
- Did I?

40:49.881 --> 40:52.148
- I'll take it from here.

40:52.150 --> 40:55.685
- I--I wasn't trying
to get Chili in trouble.

40:55.687 --> 40:58.888
I just want to--
I just want to help her.

40:58.890 --> 41:01.658
- Sometimes we have to bear
the consequences of our actions

41:01.660 --> 41:03.726
to get the help we need.

41:05.596 --> 41:08.097
- And what are
the consequences?

41:09.600 --> 41:11.534
- That'll be all, Brett.
