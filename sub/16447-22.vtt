WEBVTT

00:01.838 --> 00:02.703
We're pinned down!

00:02.706 --> 00:03.805
We can't get through!

00:03.807 --> 00:05.406
Sheldon, get over here and help!

00:05.408 --> 00:07.008
Okay, one second.

00:09.312 --> 00:11.546
Sheldon, why are you
jumping up and down?

00:11.548 --> 00:13.047
I'm trying to shoot.

00:13.049 --> 00:14.182
Then use the shoot button,

00:14.184 --> 00:16.784
not the "wonderful thing
about Tiggers" button!

00:16.786 --> 00:19.153
Aw.

00:19.155 --> 00:21.055
That's it, we're dead.

00:21.057 --> 00:22.423
Okay, challenge them again.

00:22.425 --> 00:24.392
Doing it right now.

00:24.394 --> 00:25.626
Oh, they can't.

00:25.628 --> 00:29.364
There's an important
Little League game tomorrow.

00:29.366 --> 00:33.167
No wonder they beat us,
they're jocks.

00:33.169 --> 00:34.969
What happened to me?

00:34.971 --> 00:36.871
I used to excel at these things.

00:36.873 --> 00:38.806
Kids are always better
at video games.

00:38.808 --> 00:40.742
Well, I don't like it.

00:40.744 --> 00:43.184
Mm, if it makes you feel better,
you still dress like a child.

00:44.547 --> 00:45.880
No, but it's not
just video games.

00:45.882 --> 00:48.716
I downloaded the new O.S.
for my phone, took me a week

00:48.718 --> 00:52.353
to stop accidentally texting
kissy faces to everyone.

00:52.355 --> 00:55.056
Oh, so our love is not real?

00:55.058 --> 00:57.725
Well, I-I know how you feel.

00:57.727 --> 01:00.328
I tried one of those
electronic Japanese toilets,

01:00.330 --> 01:03.631
practically shot myself
across the room.

01:04.601 --> 01:05.967
I guess I just need to face it,

01:05.969 --> 01:07.568
I'm no longer a wunderkind.

01:07.570 --> 01:10.738
Now I just
wonder what's for lunch.

01:10.740 --> 01:11.572
Hot dogs.

01:11.574 --> 01:14.242
Yay.

01:38.526 --> 01:40.827
I didn't know you could drink
while you're breastfeeding.

01:40.829 --> 01:43.630
Yeah, they say the yeast in beer
helps with milk production.

01:43.632 --> 01:45.965
I'm pretty sure that's a myth,
let me check.

01:45.967 --> 01:49.035
Ruin it for me and I'll break
this glass over your head.

01:49.037 --> 01:51.504
To denial.

01:51.506 --> 01:53.039
(whoops)

01:53.041 --> 01:54.140
Oh, I'm gonna get another.

01:54.142 --> 01:55.575
You want food?

01:55.577 --> 01:59.012
Yeah, breastfeeding burns, like,
5,000 calories a day.

01:59.014 --> 02:00.780
Do not touch that phone.

02:04.419 --> 02:05.618
Penny?

02:05.620 --> 02:07.820
Oh, Zack. Hey.

02:07.822 --> 02:09.422
What are the odds
of running into you here?

02:09.424 --> 02:12.325
Well, it's a bar,
so pretty good.

02:12.327 --> 02:14.160
Uh, what's new?

02:14.162 --> 02:15.361
Oh, tons of stuff.

02:15.363 --> 02:17.930
Put artificial grass
in my backyard, got engaged,

02:17.932 --> 02:22.268
had a scary mole
that turned out to be Sharpie.

02:22.270 --> 02:23.603
Well, congratulations.

02:23.605 --> 02:25.938
That's what
my dermatologist said.

02:25.940 --> 02:28.641
No, on-on getting engaged,
good for you.

02:28.643 --> 02:30.143
Oh, thanks. How about you?

02:30.145 --> 02:31.244
Hey, how's Leonard?

02:31.246 --> 02:32.645
Is he still smart?

02:33.647 --> 02:35.814
Yes, yes, he's working
for the government

02:35.816 --> 02:37.983
on an infinite
persistence gyroscope.

02:37.985 --> 02:39.387
Of course, the first time
I say it right,

02:39.388 --> 02:41.254
he's not even here.
(chuckles)

02:41.256 --> 02:42.723
I love that little guy.

02:42.725 --> 02:45.058
Hey, we should
all have dinner sometime.

02:45.060 --> 02:46.960
Uh, yeah, sure,
I'll check with Leonard.

02:46.962 --> 02:49.129
Cool, I'll check with Sara.

02:49.131 --> 02:52.232
Sara, pull up my calendar.

02:54.036 --> 02:56.103
It never works for me.

02:59.408 --> 03:03.376
I've been thinking about
our recent humiliation.

03:03.378 --> 03:05.912
You're gonna
have to be more specific.

03:05.914 --> 03:08.248
At the hands of those teenagers.

03:08.250 --> 03:11.218
More.

03:12.087 --> 03:13.820
Boy teenagers.

03:13.822 --> 03:16.022
Oh, the video game.
Yeah, that was bad.

03:16.024 --> 03:19.760
I started doing some reading
on cognitive vitality,

03:19.762 --> 03:23.997
and I came across an area of
research called "super-aging."

03:23.999 --> 03:25.866
You know who's a super-ager?
Jennifer Lopez.

03:25.868 --> 03:28.135
Like, what is her secret?

03:28.971 --> 03:30.904
Now, this is rare.

03:30.906 --> 03:35.075
I don't know which one of you
I want to stop talking first.

03:35.077 --> 03:37.010
The theory

03:37.012 --> 03:38.645
is that if you really tax
your brain,

03:38.647 --> 03:40.580
the neurofibers
will become thicker

03:40.582 --> 03:42.849
and the glial cells
more lustrous.

03:42.851 --> 03:45.152
Like JLo's hair.

03:45.154 --> 03:49.156
Boy, it is neck and
neck right now.

03:49.158 --> 03:50.891
How is super-aging any different

03:50.893 --> 03:52.659
than, like,
doing crossword puzzles?

03:52.661 --> 03:54.628
Well, it's not just doing
simple cognitive tasks.

03:54.630 --> 03:56.763
You need to push your brain
out of its comfort zone

03:56.765 --> 03:58.832
and reach mental exhaustion.

03:58.834 --> 04:00.500
I drive you to work every day,

04:00.502 --> 04:02.536
my brain must look
like the Hulk.

04:04.006 --> 04:05.972
If you really want
to challenge yourself,

04:05.974 --> 04:07.541
you could learn to speak Hindi.

04:07.543 --> 04:11.411
<i>Jab mein aat saal ka</i>
<i>tha Maine seekha tha.</i>

04:12.648 --> 04:14.181
Could you say that in English?

04:14.183 --> 04:16.116
I actually, I never
learned Hindi.

04:19.120 --> 04:21.053
Hey, you ready to go?

04:21.055 --> 04:22.622
Yeah, I guess.

04:22.624 --> 04:24.391
What's the matter?

04:24.393 --> 04:26.359
Honestly? It's a little strange

04:26.361 --> 04:27.861
having dinner
with your ex-boyfriend,

04:27.863 --> 04:30.030
and it's not like
we have a lot to talk about.

04:30.032 --> 04:31.832
What? He loves you, okay?

04:31.834 --> 04:33.200
And he's interested
in your work.

04:33.202 --> 04:36.636
You could talk about
the infinite perspective...

04:36.638 --> 04:39.139
I swear I know it.

04:39.141 --> 04:41.174
It'll be fine, let's just go.

04:41.176 --> 04:42.976
Well, and his fiancée will
be there, so you know,

04:42.978 --> 04:45.545
if the conversation lags, we
can talk about their wedding.

04:45.547 --> 04:46.847
(groans)

04:46.849 --> 04:48.448
Come on, I spent
an entire plane ride

04:48.450 --> 04:50.784
with you talking about
the trailer for <i>Deadpool 2.</i>

04:50.786 --> 04:53.153
Ha! I knew you weren't asleep.

04:54.823 --> 04:55.956
Hey, guys.

04:55.958 --> 04:57.791
Hi.
Hi. Hey, where's your fiancée?

04:57.793 --> 05:00.160
Oh, she couldn't make it.
She had an emergency.

05:00.162 --> 05:01.494
Oh, no, what happened?

05:01.496 --> 05:04.164
I didn't ask.

05:06.802 --> 05:08.168
Hey.

05:08.170 --> 05:09.536
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:09.538 --> 05:11.304
What smells so good?

05:11.306 --> 05:13.506
Raj is teaching me
to make croissants.

05:13.508 --> 05:15.942
Is this part
of your super-aging?

05:15.944 --> 05:18.345
Yes. Yeah, it seemed
daunting at first,

05:18.347 --> 05:19.479
but then I realized,

05:19.481 --> 05:22.148
it's like the chemistry set
I had as a kid.

05:22.150 --> 05:23.149
Only, when your brother
eats this,

05:23.151 --> 05:25.185
no one has to call
Poison Control.

05:25.187 --> 05:26.753
KOOTHRAPPALI:
Okay.

05:26.755 --> 05:28.688
Shall we?

05:32.094 --> 05:33.960
Oh, my God.

05:33.962 --> 05:38.331
It's light, it's
flaky, it's buttery.

05:38.333 --> 05:41.568
You don't need to have sex with
him, just eat one of these.

05:42.771 --> 05:44.671
Yes, it is delicious.

05:44.673 --> 05:47.173
Wha... Physicist,
baker, lover,

05:47.175 --> 05:48.375
what can't I do?

05:48.377 --> 05:51.645
Well, clearly mental
tasks are not enough.

05:51.647 --> 05:53.747
Maybe you need to challenge
your motor skills.

05:53.749 --> 05:56.783
For the last time, I am not
having a tickle fight with you.

05:58.220 --> 05:59.419
You want a real challenge,

05:59.421 --> 06:02.489
try keeping me from
eating more of these.

06:02.491 --> 06:04.925
You're just using food

06:04.927 --> 06:06.793
to mask the fear that
you're fundamentally unlovable

06:06.795 --> 06:09.963
and therefore
going to be alone forever.

06:09.965 --> 06:12.899
Damn it, he's good at that, too.

06:16.171 --> 06:17.704
Thanks.

06:17.706 --> 06:20.106
Wow, working on a top secret
government project,

06:20.108 --> 06:22.409
that is so cool.
Aw.

06:22.411 --> 06:25.211
Do you have a bodyguard
to keep spies away?

06:25.213 --> 06:28.548
I have Sheldon,
that keeps most people away.

06:29.851 --> 06:30.984
I miss that guy.

06:30.986 --> 06:32.986
He's like
the Swedish Chef Muppet.

06:32.988 --> 06:35.722
I don't know what he's saying,
but he's funny.

06:35.724 --> 06:39.693
Oh, I know what he's saying,
and he's not, he's not funny.

06:39.695 --> 06:41.795
So, Penny,
what's going on with you?

06:41.797 --> 06:43.630
How's the job?

06:43.632 --> 06:45.665
Uh, it's okay, I'm still
in pharmaceutical sales.

06:45.667 --> 06:47.000
She's doing amazing.

06:47.002 --> 06:48.802
She can actually make
a side effect,

06:48.804 --> 06:50.937
like 10% chance
of liver failure,

06:50.939 --> 06:54.975
sound like a 90% chance
of liver success.

06:54.977 --> 06:57.544
Yeah, lying isn't
my favorite part of the job.

06:57.546 --> 07:00.146
Actually, I'm not crazy
about a lot of it.

07:00.148 --> 07:01.114
Hey, if you're not happy there,
I've been looking

07:01.116 --> 07:02.782
for a new head of sales
at my company.

07:02.784 --> 07:05.185
And we don't sell drugs,
just menus,

07:05.187 --> 07:06.419
so the only lie
you'll be telling

07:06.421 --> 07:08.588
is we print on recycled paper.

07:10.525 --> 07:12.759
We don't.

07:13.695 --> 07:15.962
Oh, that's a nice offer.

07:15.964 --> 07:17.230
You know,
we'd make a great team.

07:17.232 --> 07:19.399
Or as we say
in the menu business,

07:19.401 --> 07:22.569
I can't do this
without "Me N U."

07:23.472 --> 07:26.439
Right, 'cause it spells "menu."

07:26.441 --> 07:28.608
Yeah, right? It's funny.
I got a lot of menu jokes,

07:28.610 --> 07:30.510
but that's my favorite.

07:33.348 --> 07:36.950
All right, this is everything.

07:36.952 --> 07:38.485
What do you want to learn?

07:38.487 --> 07:41.054
It really doesn't matter,
as long as it's challenging.

07:41.056 --> 07:45.058
Okay, well, how about,
oh, I teach you

07:45.060 --> 07:48.495
some close-up... magic.

07:48.497 --> 07:51.431
Howard, I'm trying
to make myself uncomfortable,

07:51.433 --> 07:53.133
not everyone else.

07:54.536 --> 07:56.569
So you wanted to learn
something physical

07:56.571 --> 07:58.872
and you came
to Howard Wolowitz?

07:59.875 --> 08:01.941
Hey, the circus arts

08:01.943 --> 08:04.644
are very physically
and mentally demanding.

08:04.646 --> 08:06.446
Have you ever tried to juggle?

08:06.448 --> 08:08.014
Yes, I'm juggling
my love for you

08:08.016 --> 08:10.650
and my embarrassment of you
right now.

08:10.652 --> 08:14.521
And it's hard, isn't it?

08:16.024 --> 08:18.024
So the key is,

08:18.026 --> 08:20.627
the moment one ball
is at the top of its arc,

08:20.629 --> 08:22.462
you toss the next one.

08:22.464 --> 08:24.497
Hmm?
Okay, I think I got that.

08:24.499 --> 08:26.099
Uh, h-hold on.
(chuckles)

08:26.101 --> 08:29.235
There's a, an old saying
in juggling.

08:29.237 --> 08:31.204
Is it "I'm going to die alone"?

08:34.076 --> 08:37.943
No, it's "if you want
to have fun, start with one."

08:38.712 --> 08:40.447
Yours we think,
but we do not say.

08:41.549 --> 08:43.982
All right, just toss it up
and catch it a few times,

08:43.985 --> 08:45.018
get comfortable with it.

08:45.020 --> 08:46.386
Okay.

08:49.558 --> 08:51.658
(laughs softly)

08:51.660 --> 08:53.126
Just to be on the safe side,

08:53.128 --> 08:56.296
am I in any danger of
getting juggler's elbow?

08:56.298 --> 08:58.164
No.

08:58.166 --> 09:02.836
Are you sure? 'Cause
I'm feeling a twinge.

09:04.072 --> 09:05.638
See, that wasn't so bad.

09:05.640 --> 09:06.806
He even picked up the check.

09:06.808 --> 09:08.007
Yeah.

09:08.009 --> 09:09.609
Although, when he was trying
to figure out the tip,

09:09.611 --> 09:11.644
I'm pretty sure I saw smoke
coming out of his ears.

09:11.646 --> 09:12.879
(laughs)

09:14.249 --> 09:16.716
You're not really considering
working for him, are you?

09:16.718 --> 09:19.452
Well, maybe, I mean, it
seems kind of perfect.

09:19.454 --> 09:21.121
I have sales experience,

09:21.123 --> 09:23.123
and I've been a waitress,
so I have restaurant experience,

09:23.125 --> 09:25.558
and if he's figuring out
my Christmas bonus,

09:25.560 --> 09:27.360
we could buy a boat.

09:27.362 --> 09:30.230
Don't you think it might
be a little weird

09:30.232 --> 09:32.265
to work for someone
you used to date?

09:32.267 --> 09:36.136
You work with Sheldon,
you tell me.

09:36.138 --> 09:39.672
Yeah, it's weird.

09:43.078 --> 09:46.212
Okay, are you seriously jealous
of me working with Zack?

09:46.214 --> 09:47.914
No, no, I-I'm not jealous,
I just think

09:47.916 --> 09:50.183
you have got a good thing
going where you are right now,

09:50.185 --> 09:51.451
and you make
great money

09:51.453 --> 09:53.253
and you haven't slept
with any of your coworkers.

09:53.255 --> 09:57.757
Great, so you want me to stay
at a job I'm not happy at?

09:57.759 --> 09:59.359
(scoffs)
Uh...

09:59.361 --> 10:00.693
You okay?

10:00.695 --> 10:04.097
You kind of look like Zack
trying to figure out that tip.

10:05.066 --> 10:08.234
Of course I don't want
you to be unhappy,

10:08.236 --> 10:09.869
but I also want
you to be smart,

10:09.871 --> 10:12.639
and working for an ex-boyfriend
isn't very smart.

10:14.843 --> 10:16.963
You don't have to stop,
just slow down, I'll jump out.

10:22.035 --> 10:24.202
Amy, look,
I'm on a unicycle!

10:25.705 --> 10:29.841
How did you get
from croissants to a unicycle?

10:29.843 --> 10:32.043
I hurt myself juggling.

10:32.812 --> 10:34.579
Where did
you get it?

10:34.581 --> 10:35.847
Howard said
I could borrow it,

10:35.849 --> 10:38.650
Bernadette said forever.

10:38.652 --> 10:41.052
Have you tried
letting go of the rope?

10:41.054 --> 10:44.188
What, are you crazy?
I'm on a unicycle.

10:44.190 --> 10:46.491
All right, well, have fun.

10:46.493 --> 10:48.293
Wait, I need help
getting down.

10:48.295 --> 10:50.495
Well, what do you want me to do?

10:50.497 --> 10:51.796
Drag out our mattress
and put it over here,

10:51.798 --> 10:53.298
then go across the hall,
get their mattress

10:53.300 --> 10:54.332
and put it over here.

10:54.334 --> 10:55.900
But before you
do any of that,

10:55.902 --> 10:57.669
scratch my nose.

11:01.741 --> 11:04.208
So you told her
she was being dumb?

11:04.210 --> 11:08.079
No, I told her she was
being not smart.

11:08.848 --> 11:11.716
Which was dumb.

11:11.718 --> 11:14.385
Why did you even go
to dinner with the guy?

11:14.387 --> 11:16.554
We covered this, I'm dumb.

11:18.625 --> 11:20.425
So he's my ex-boyfriend,
who cares?

11:20.427 --> 11:22.393
I can't believe Leonard
would be so insecure.

11:22.395 --> 11:23.628
Really?

11:23.630 --> 11:26.497
I have no trouble
believing that at all.

11:26.499 --> 11:28.199
And Zack's engaged.

11:28.201 --> 11:30.201
Leonard has no reason
to feel threatened.

11:30.203 --> 11:33.104
We're talking about
the same Leonard, right?

11:34.674 --> 11:37.208
So you think it's fine
if she works for Zack?

11:37.210 --> 11:38.810
I don't know, maybe.

11:38.812 --> 11:41.679
Well, he is much more
attractive than Leonard.

11:42.549 --> 11:43.948
Yes,

11:43.950 --> 11:47.585
but that's gonna be true of
a lot of guys she works for.

11:48.989 --> 11:51.522
Yeah, but she also
used to sleep with Zack.

11:52.325 --> 11:53.858
Again...
(chuckles)

11:56.429 --> 11:58.496
I would never let Howard
work with an ex.

11:58.498 --> 11:59.564
What, you wouldn't trust him?

11:59.566 --> 12:01.199
I wouldn't trust her.

12:01.201 --> 12:05.036
He's thin and sexy
like a Jewish greyhound.

12:06.840 --> 12:10.174
Yeah, that-that is
the sexiest dog.

12:11.378 --> 12:12.844
And I'd like to think
Howie wouldn't take a job

12:12.846 --> 12:14.112
I was uncomfortable with.

12:14.114 --> 12:15.513
'Cause he's scared of you?
Terrified.

12:15.515 --> 12:16.714
Yeah.

12:17.884 --> 12:19.851
You know what? I'm with
Leonard, this isn't cool.

12:19.853 --> 12:21.252
Thank you.

12:21.254 --> 12:22.387
I disagree.

12:22.389 --> 12:24.589
Penny is a strong,
independent woman.

12:24.591 --> 12:26.958
The more you try to control her,
the more she'll push back.

12:26.960 --> 12:28.393
So you think it's okay?

12:28.395 --> 12:30.094
Oh, no, she's gonna leave you
for someone,

12:30.096 --> 12:32.230
might as well
get it over with.

12:37.404 --> 12:38.703
What are you doing?

12:38.705 --> 12:40.938
I'm returning this stuff
to Howard.

12:40.940 --> 12:42.306
Oh.

12:42.308 --> 12:44.308
Well, Bernadette made me
promise if you didn't want it,

12:44.310 --> 12:46.911
we'd give it
to a homeless clown.

12:49.015 --> 12:50.948
What happened to
learning the unicycle?

12:50.950 --> 12:52.684
Oh, I stopped that,
it was dumb.

12:52.686 --> 12:58.289
Uni, bi, tri, menstrual,
all cycles are dumb.

12:58.291 --> 13:00.258
You said juggling was dumb, too.

13:00.260 --> 13:01.859
Well, it is.

13:01.861 --> 13:05.063
If I wanted to hold three things
at once, I'd wear cargo pants.

13:05.065 --> 13:06.798
Sheldon, is it possible that

13:06.800 --> 13:10.802
when things get really
difficult, you just give up?

13:10.804 --> 13:13.171
Are you calling me a quitter?

13:13.173 --> 13:15.039
Well, if you honestly...

13:15.041 --> 13:16.307
This conversation
is over.

13:21.114 --> 13:22.580
His mother warned me.

13:23.416 --> 13:25.016
Everybody warned me.

13:26.853 --> 13:28.352
Actually, he warned me.

13:33.159 --> 13:35.727
Hey.
Hi.

13:35.729 --> 13:36.828
You want to talk?

13:36.830 --> 13:40.298
That doesn't seem to be
where I shine.

13:41.601 --> 13:43.735
How about I just give you
one of these?

13:44.938 --> 13:47.238
Look, we can have a
reasonable conversation

13:47.240 --> 13:48.506
and I won't get mad.

13:50.810 --> 13:54.612
I don't like it after sex,
and I don't like it now.

13:59.152 --> 14:01.385
Yeah, sorry.
Yeah.

14:01.387 --> 14:02.787
All right,
just come here.

14:03.823 --> 14:05.790
Look, I get me working
with Zack is weird

14:05.792 --> 14:07.425
and I don't want you
to be uncomfortable.

14:07.427 --> 14:08.993
Well, thanks.

14:08.995 --> 14:11.496
And I don't want you to be
stuck at a job you don't like.

14:11.498 --> 14:12.897
Then what do we do?

14:12.899 --> 14:14.432
Well, I don't love it,
but if you really want

14:14.434 --> 14:16.567
to take this job, I'll find
a way to deal with it.

14:16.569 --> 14:19.070
No, I know you'll try,
but it'll make you miserable,

14:19.072 --> 14:20.938
which will make me
miserable, and...

14:20.940 --> 14:22.940
I'm just gonna stay
where I'm at for now.

14:22.942 --> 14:24.375
No, no, no, no,
you're-you're unhappy there

14:24.377 --> 14:26.511
and then you're gonna blame
me for making you stay,

14:26.513 --> 14:28.679
and it's fine, I'll
just-- I'll suck it up.

14:28.681 --> 14:30.481
You don't need to do that,
it's okay.

14:30.483 --> 14:32.483
Yeah, see, now I feel terrible,

14:32.485 --> 14:35.353
like I'm being selfish
and holding you back.

14:39.392 --> 14:41.192
What? Say something.

14:45.465 --> 14:46.964
Yeah, that is pretty annoying.

14:51.271 --> 14:52.270
I made you tea.

14:52.272 --> 14:53.871
Thank you.

14:53.873 --> 14:55.706
I'm sorry I called you
a quitter.

14:55.708 --> 14:59.043
It's okay, I stopped being
upset about that.

14:59.045 --> 15:01.913
And no, the irony
is not lost on me.

15:02.882 --> 15:04.282
What are you reading?

15:04.284 --> 15:06.350
This article says the
peak age for making

15:06.352 --> 15:08.586
a Nobel Prize-winning
discovery is 40.

15:08.588 --> 15:09.587
So?

15:09.589 --> 15:11.956
So I'm running out of time.

15:11.958 --> 15:14.892
That's ridiculous,
you're a brilliant man.

15:14.894 --> 15:17.428
The best years of your life
are still ahead of you.

15:17.430 --> 15:20.898
Oh, you have to say that,
you're sweet on me.

15:20.900 --> 15:22.567
Well, if you're really
worried about your career,

15:22.569 --> 15:25.002
maybe you should consider
spending a little less time

15:25.004 --> 15:26.938
with video games
and comic books.

15:26.940 --> 15:28.339
Hey!

15:28.341 --> 15:30.808
I thought you were sweet on me.

15:30.810 --> 15:34.145
Okay, fine, let's say you
never win a Nobel Prize.

15:34.147 --> 15:37.048
Let's say you spend your life
doing solid scientific research

15:37.050 --> 15:38.482
surrounded by
friends and loved ones

15:38.484 --> 15:40.284
who appreciate you,

15:40.286 --> 15:44.088
not for what you've accomplished
but for who you are as a man.

15:44.090 --> 15:46.457
Wouldn't that be
a life well-lived?

15:47.360 --> 15:48.826
You're so cute.

15:50.029 --> 15:52.196
I'm gonna go learn
how to walk on stilts.

15:55.768 --> 15:56.968
So many warnings.

16:00.874 --> 16:02.206
Okay, are you sure
about this?

16:02.208 --> 16:04.242
Absolutely. I just
want you to be happy.

16:04.244 --> 16:07.478
And maybe a little turned on
about how selfless I'm being.

16:10.116 --> 16:11.749
Penny, what's up?

16:11.751 --> 16:14.619
Hey, uh, so I've been
thinking about it

16:14.621 --> 16:16.320
and I want to take the job.

16:16.322 --> 16:18.356
Oh, bad news.

16:18.358 --> 16:20.625
When my fiancée found out
that I was offering a job

16:20.627 --> 16:23.227
to my ex-girlfriend,
she said it was a stupid idea

16:23.229 --> 16:25.563
and threw a shoe at me.

16:26.432 --> 16:28.966
Oh, so
there's no job?

16:28.968 --> 16:32.837
Nope, just a little bump
on my forehead.

16:32.839 --> 16:34.405
Okay, thanks anyway.

16:34.407 --> 16:35.773
By

16:36.609 --> 16:38.409
Well, his
fiancée thought

16:38.411 --> 16:40.912
the idea of us working
together was stupid.

16:40.914 --> 16:42.880
You were right, I was wrong.

16:48.588 --> 16:49.620
Aren't you gonna say anything?

16:49.622 --> 16:51.756
Not if I want to be
doing this later.

16:57.830 --> 16:59.297
Hey, I didn't know
you were home.

16:59.299 --> 17:00.398
Where you been?

17:00.400 --> 17:02.667
I went to
see your mom.

17:02.669 --> 17:04.135
Seriously,
where were you?

17:04.137 --> 17:06.537
I just told you, your mom's.

17:06.539 --> 17:08.039
Why?

17:08.040 --> 17:11.474
Well, since you find my magic
tricks so embarrassing,

17:11.477 --> 17:12.977
I got to wondering

17:12.979 --> 17:16.213
what cool hobbies
you had as a kid.

17:16.214 --> 17:18.115
Oh.

17:18.117 --> 17:20.785
What'd she say?

17:20.787 --> 17:22.686
She didn't say much of anything.

17:22.689 --> 17:24.555
But she said a lot!

17:27.760 --> 17:30.294
(puppet voice):
Hi, Bernadette, remember me?

17:32.665 --> 17:34.699
First of all, that's not
what she sounds like,

17:34.701 --> 17:37.234
she's from South Carolina.

17:37.236 --> 17:39.804
(chuckles) I can't believe
you made fun of me

17:39.806 --> 17:44.141
all these years while you
were a closeted ventriloquist.

17:44.143 --> 17:48.045
Okay, it's not like I wanted
to be a ventriloquist.

17:48.047 --> 17:50.481
I was in beauty pageants
and I needed a talent

17:50.483 --> 17:51.515
besides spreading rumors

17:51.517 --> 17:54.051
that the other contestants
were pregnant.

17:54.053 --> 17:56.620
Well, since you enjoyed

17:56.622 --> 17:58.289
getting rid of all my stuff,
you know,

17:58.291 --> 18:00.658
maybe we should throw this
little lady in the wood chipper.

18:00.660 --> 18:01.959
No!

18:01.961 --> 18:03.995
And the little lady has a name.

18:03.997 --> 18:05.863
Which is?

18:07.700 --> 18:10.801
Tammy Jo St. Cloud.

18:11.671 --> 18:14.338
"Tammy Jo St. Cloud."

18:14.340 --> 18:16.207
Oh, and I'm a dork for juggling.

18:16.209 --> 18:18.743
Sorry, you're
not a dork.

18:18.745 --> 18:21.512
(Southern accent):
You're a clown.

18:22.682 --> 18:24.148
(normal voice):
Tammy Jo, don't say that,

18:24.150 --> 18:25.383
you'll make him feel bad.

18:26.119 --> 18:27.318
(Southern accent):
Look at him,

18:27.320 --> 18:30.187
what reason he got to feel good?

18:31.024 --> 18:33.457
All right, very funny.

18:33.459 --> 18:34.525
Don't listen to her,

18:34.527 --> 18:35.793
she's been in a box
for, like, 25 years.

18:35.795 --> 18:36.761
(chuckles)

18:36.763 --> 18:38.195
Yeah, back when his haircut

18:38.197 --> 18:41.032
was fashionable.
(giggles)

18:42.435 --> 18:43.701
That's enough, put her away.

18:43.703 --> 18:45.302
(Southern accent):
Oh, big daddy,

18:45.304 --> 18:46.604
I don't think so.

18:46.606 --> 18:49.407
You marry Miss Bernie,
you marry me.

18:50.610 --> 18:53.878
We all family now.

18:54.714 --> 18:56.414
All right,
you're freaking me out.

18:56.416 --> 18:57.948
(Southern accent):
Don't be that way.

18:57.950 --> 18:59.383
If you don't mind
a few splinters,

18:59.385 --> 19:01.552
we can have us a ménage à trois.

19:01.554 --> 19:02.753
Ooh!

19:08.585 --> 19:10.785
I'm doing it.

19:10.787 --> 19:12.720
I'm doing it.
(chuckles)

19:12.722 --> 19:17.158
I'm tall and
I'm doing it!

19:17.827 --> 19:19.160
(snorts softly)

19:19.810 --> 19:21.410
Ah, man.
