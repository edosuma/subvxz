<i>We have obtained footage

<i>where Harper claimed
that the accident</i>

06:28.731 --> 06:32.001
<i>So, this so-called "swarm"

06:32.034 --> 06:34.870
<i>Yes, for the 50th time.</i>

06:34.903 --> 06:36.839
<i>It impacted in the mare crisium.</i>

<i>Commander Fowler,</i>

06:38.674 --> 06:41.110
<i>a passing meteor

06:41.143 --> 06:43.812
<i>could have caused that kind
of disturbance, correct?</i>

06:43.846 --> 06:45.156
<i>As you know,
I was unconscious, but...</i>

06:45.180 --> 06:46.849
<i>Yes or no?</i>

06:46.882 --> 06:48.618
<i>Can a solar flare</i>

06:48.651 --> 06:50.062
<i>cause the kind of disturbance
you witnessed</i>

06:50.086 --> 06:52.689
<i>in the shuttle's

06:52.722 --> 06:55.759
<i>I guess, yes, technically.
It could have.</i>

06:55.792 --> 06:57.293
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

06:58.728 --> 07:00.130
<i>I lost my friend up there.</i>

07:00.163 --> 07:01.731
<i>Because of negligence.</i>

07:22.886 --> 07:24.888
Do you need
to be watching that again?

07:28.958 --> 07:30.360
You know what?

07:30.393 --> 07:33.595
Grandma is going to be
so excited to see you.

07:33.630 --> 07:37.168
Dad's not coming, is he?

07:37.201 --> 07:39.370
Your dad's got a lot

07:39.403 --> 07:41.939
I know. That's why
we lost the house.

07:44.708 --> 07:47.111
Maybe he'll come visit you
for Thanksgiving.

07:47.144 --> 07:48.646
Would you like that?

07:52.183 --> 07:53.884
I don't wanna move.

07:53.918 --> 07:56.287
I hate New Jersey.

08:37.229 --> 08:39.397
I'm sorry, sir.
My mum always said

08:39.431 --> 08:40.707
"it's better to beg
for forgiveness"

08:40.732 --> 08:41.732
"than ask permission."

08:50.742 --> 08:53.278
Oh, crap. Was that red or blue?

08:53.311 --> 08:55.080

09:07.492 --> 09:09.003

- Adios.

<i>Hola senoras.</i>

You're seven
and a half minutes late.

09:36.088 --> 09:37.757
I have to write this up.

09:40.259 --> 09:41.460
- Hello, there.
- Hi.

09:41.494 --> 09:42.728
What can I get you?

09:42.762 --> 09:45.464
I'd like a pastrami madness...

09:46.966 --> 09:49.368
And I would also
like to ask you, dear,

09:49.402 --> 09:53.272
what sauces do you serve
with the pastrami?

09:53.306 --> 09:57.443
Oh, yeah. We've got barbecue,
honey mustard, ranch...

10:00.280 --> 10:01.782
What the fuck!

10:01.815 --> 10:04.952
What was the... the last one?

10:04.985 --> 10:06.186
One madness coming up.

10:06.220 --> 10:07.921
We have a strict
no phone policy.

10:07.955 --> 10:09.389
Can I take my 10?

10:11.558 --> 10:14.027
Hello. My name
is Dr. Kc houseman,

10:14.061 --> 10:15.495
and I've uncovered what might be

10:15.529 --> 10:17.207
the most important discovery
in human history.

10:17.231 --> 10:18.498
I need you to patch me through

10:18.532 --> 10:20.200
to the director of NASA
immediately.

10:20.234 --> 10:22.903
Honey, I sell t-shirts and toys.

10:22.936 --> 10:25.806
I can patch you through
to customer service.

10:25.839 --> 10:26.873
<i>Please hold.</i>

10:46.293 --> 10:47.428
Hello?

11:05.880 --> 11:07.382
Black, two sugar.

11:07.415 --> 11:09.984
Oh, you read my mind. Thank you.

11:10.018 --> 11:11.128
What are you doing up so early?

11:11.152 --> 11:13.488
I could ask you the same.

11:13.521 --> 11:15.189
Is everything okay?

11:15.223 --> 11:16.991
Will be.
So I'm gonna be home by dinner.

11:17.025 --> 11:19.093
If I'm not,
make sure Jimmy does his homework,

11:19.127 --> 11:22.063
- has a bath...
- You worry too much.

11:22.096 --> 11:23.998
I've got everything
under control.

11:24.032 --> 11:26.167
Right. Talk soon.

11:45.120 --> 11:47.456
Okay, don't everybody
speak at once.

11:49.124 --> 11:51.327
The moon's orbit has shifted.

11:52.061 --> 11:53.262
I'm sorry.

11:53.295 --> 11:56.598
Its orbital radius
is decreasing.

11:56.633 --> 11:57.966
Well, that's not possible.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.501
We thought the same,

11:59.535 --> 12:02.137
so we ran the numbers
and triple-checked our data.

12:02.171 --> 12:04.039
So, the moon's been
orbiting around the earth

12:04.073 --> 12:05.441
for billions of years,

12:05.474 --> 12:07.434
and now you're telling me
it's changed its course?

12:09.945 --> 12:11.213
This isn't kindergarten, speak.

12:11.246 --> 12:14.016
Right, uh, yes.
So, on its last orbit,

12:14.049 --> 12:17.219
our lunar reconnaissance probe
picked up something strange.

12:17.252 --> 12:18.655
What is that?

12:18.688 --> 12:20.022
We don't know.

12:20.055 --> 12:21.457
We have photometric measurements

12:21.490 --> 12:23.250
of gaseous spectra
being emitted from inside.

12:26.296 --> 12:27.297
Where is this?

12:28.298 --> 12:29.866
Mare crisium.

12:32.435 --> 12:33.903
<i>How many times
do I have to tell you?</i>

12:33.937 --> 12:35.572
I need to speak
to deputy director Fowler

12:35.605 --> 12:37.374
immediately.

12:37.407 --> 12:39.409
But this is urgent.

12:39.442 --> 12:41.311
I understand how
a restraining order works,

12:41.344 --> 12:43.055
but if you people at NASA
won't listen to me,

12:43.079 --> 12:44.247
how am I supposed to...

12:44.280 --> 12:45.281
Hello?

12:50.721 --> 12:52.422
What would elon do?

12:59.996 --> 13:01.531
Oh, fuzz aldrin.

13:01.564 --> 13:04.167
How many times have I told you
to use the litter box?

13:07.103 --> 13:08.438
Oh, god.

13:13.444 --> 13:16.681
"Astronaut day." This is today.

13:18.115 --> 13:20.951
Fuzz, you're a damn genius!

13:25.456 --> 13:27.626
Extra back scratches later.

13:41.172 --> 13:44.041
Our teacher said you're
a washed up no-show.

13:44.074 --> 13:46.310
She's complaining to someone.

13:46.343 --> 13:49.180
You really don't look
like an astronaut.

13:49.213 --> 13:52.717
Well, are you going to
teach us about space or what?

13:53.785 --> 13:54.985
Brian!

13:56.220 --> 13:57.988
Brian!

14:00.492 --> 14:03.696
Open the goddamn door.
You're three months late!

14:04.630 --> 14:06.198
Shit.

14:06.231 --> 14:07.700
I can hear you in there.

14:11.737 --> 14:13.371
- Oh, shit. Oof!
- Brian!

14:20.045 --> 14:23.448
<i>To put it bluntly,
the moon is a megastructure.</i>

14:23.482 --> 14:27.385
Do you get it?
Huge and artificial!

14:27.419 --> 14:28.730
Whoever built
this incredible thing

14:28.754 --> 14:31.289
must think
we're a pathetic species.

14:31.323 --> 14:33.525
But don't even get me
started on eclipses.

14:33.558 --> 14:35.193
They're only possible
because the moon

14:35.227 --> 14:38.463
is exactly 400 times smaller
than the sun,

14:38.497 --> 14:41.500
and exactly 400 times
closer to the earth.

14:42.601 --> 14:45.370
Anyone know how that happened?

14:45.403 --> 14:48.074
Uh... 'Cause the moon's
a megastructure?

14:48.107 --> 14:50.109
Yeah, someone's
paying attention!

14:55.147 --> 14:57.483
Let me tell you kids something.

14:57.517 --> 14:59.820
When Apollo 12 dropped
their empty fuel tank,

14:59.853 --> 15:02.789
the impact made the moon
ring like a bell.

15:02.823 --> 15:05.358
Bong!

15:05.391 --> 15:09.495
It rang for hours.
And do you know why?

15:11.397 --> 15:13.499
Because the damn moon is hollow.

15:15.501 --> 15:17.704
Put that in your pipe
and smoke it.

15:20.874 --> 15:23.543
Hello. I'm Brian Harper.

15:23.576 --> 15:26.212
I'm supposed to be
speaking here today.

15:26.245 --> 15:28.314
Oh!

15:28.347 --> 15:30.851
I'm Dr. Kc houseman,
megastructurist.

15:30.884 --> 15:32.184
It's a real honor.

15:32.218 --> 15:33.352
I'm sorry, who are you?

15:33.386 --> 15:35.222
Um...

15:35.255 --> 15:37.524
I've made a shocking discovery.

15:37.558 --> 15:40.862
I need you to get me in
touch with NASA immediately.

15:40.895 --> 15:43.597
Well, NASA and I aren't really
on speaking terms these days.

15:43.631 --> 15:46.199
Well, that will change...

15:46.233 --> 15:48.535
When you tell them that
the moon is out of orbit.

15:49.771 --> 15:50.772
Really?

15:53.206 --> 15:55.576
Hey, kids, I'm gonna
go get this all sorted out.

15:55.609 --> 15:56.644
Be right back.

15:56.678 --> 15:58.412
Look at the data.

15:58.445 --> 16:00.447
A natural body does not
change its orbit overnight.

16:00.480 --> 16:02.249
Yeah, well, my natural body

16:02.282 --> 16:04.151
is walking away
from you right now.

16:04.184 --> 16:06.362
There must be something wrong
with the moon's power source.

16:06.386 --> 16:08.856
- Yeah, that must be it.
- I knew you'd believe me.

16:08.890 --> 16:11.659
People usually think
I'm some kind of crackpot.

16:11.693 --> 16:14.127
Hey, fellas, I need this guy
escorted off the premises

16:14.161 --> 16:15.362
for impersonating me

16:15.395 --> 16:16.774
and creeping out
a bunch of school kids.

16:16.798 --> 16:18.498
I was not impersonating you.

16:18.532 --> 16:20.310
Sir, I'm going to have
to ask you to come with us.

16:20.334 --> 16:21.812
Sorry, man.
I got enough on my plate without

16:21.836 --> 16:23.648
some crazy guy thinking
the moon's out of orbit.

16:23.672 --> 16:25.340
- I'm not crazy!
- Okay.

16:25.373 --> 16:26.407
Read this.

16:27.542 --> 16:29.344
All right, I'm on my way.

16:34.248 --> 16:35.751
Oh. Hi.

17:03.879 --> 17:04.946
Is this a butt dial?

17:04.980 --> 17:06.815
Put on channel 16.

17:06.848 --> 17:08.425
<i>Well, I thought
we weren't speaking anymore.</i>

17:08.449 --> 17:10.685
Are you watching?

17:10.719 --> 17:12.354
<i>The two suspects
who have rolled through</i>

17:12.387 --> 17:14.289
<i>at least two red lights...</i>

17:14.323 --> 17:17.894
Okay, looks like some idiot
tried to outrun the cops.

17:17.926 --> 17:21.396
Yeah. That idiot is your son.

17:21.430 --> 17:22.665
Sonny doesn't even have a car.

17:22.699 --> 17:24.199
I'm still fixing up the mustang.

17:24.233 --> 17:26.970
Tom gave him one
for his birthday.

17:27.002 --> 17:29.806
<i>The car has stopped.
It's an expensive sports car.</i>

17:29.839 --> 17:31.741
<i>Two young men that appear
to be in their 20s.</i>

17:31.775 --> 17:34.443
Oh, my god. Are you seeing this?

17:34.476 --> 17:36.378
<i>LAPD have them in custody.</i>

17:36.412 --> 17:38.213
<i>Out for a joy ride</i>

17:38.247 --> 17:39.557
<i>and this day is not going
to end well for them.</i>

17:39.581 --> 17:40.884
<i>There you have it.</i>

17:40.917 --> 17:42.852
<i>Another high-speed car chase...</i>

18:03.440 --> 18:05.910
Next case, Sonny Neil Harper.

18:13.751 --> 18:15.853
It says here you just turned 18.

18:15.886 --> 18:17.487
Unfortunately,
that makes you an adult

18:17.520 --> 18:18.889
in the eyes of the law.

18:18.923 --> 18:21.558
What? Hey, aren't you
gonna say something?

18:21.591 --> 18:24.394
Because of the reckless nature
of your actions

18:24.427 --> 18:27.564
and the amount
of illegal substances

18:27.597 --> 18:29.332
present at the time
of your arrest...

18:29.365 --> 18:30.911
No, your honor.
Those drugs weren't his.

18:30.935 --> 18:32.646
They were just his buddy's.
They were on their way

18:32.670 --> 18:34.047
- to a concert.
- Quiet in my court.

18:34.071 --> 18:35.448
Well, he just got scared.
That's why he took off.

18:35.472 --> 18:37.007
All right, that's it. Bailiff.

18:37.041 --> 18:38.885
Your honor, excuse the actions
of my client's father.

18:38.909 --> 18:40.577
We're prepared to pay

18:40.610 --> 18:42.646
whatever the bail is right now.

18:42.680 --> 18:44.280
Money's no object.

18:44.314 --> 18:46.358
Well, I guess that makes
the defendant a flight risk.

18:46.382 --> 18:47.585
Your honor, we do not mean

18:47.618 --> 18:49.286
to offend the court in any way.

18:49.320 --> 18:51.522
I'm postponing this
bail hearing till next week.

18:52.623 --> 18:53.992
Bailiff, remove Mr. Harper.

18:54.025 --> 18:55.827
Wait. You can't...
Don't listen to him.

18:55.861 --> 18:57.394
You can't put him in jail
for a week.

18:57.428 --> 18:58.830
Please, I'm begging you.

18:58.864 --> 19:00.297
Sonny, I'm gonna get you out.

19:02.033 --> 19:04.335
<i>If you're looking
for the deal of your life,</i>

19:04.368 --> 19:06.337
<i>come to Tom Lopez Lexus,</i>

19:06.370 --> 19:07.706
<i>where you're not
just a customer,</i>

19:07.739 --> 19:09.507
<i>we treat you like family.</i>

19:09.540 --> 19:11.943
Do you have any idea
how a courtroom operates?

19:11.977 --> 19:13.444
Your lawyer was doing nothing.

19:13.477 --> 19:15.013
<i>Oh, so you know better
than my lawyer</i>

19:15.046 --> 19:17.048
who's on a $50,000 retainer!

19:17.082 --> 19:19.450
I thought money
was no object, Tom.

19:19.483 --> 19:21.385
Oh, no, no, no.
It is when you don't have any.

19:21.418 --> 19:23.064
<i>Nice move, by the way.
Sonny's now a flight risk.</i>

19:23.088 --> 19:24.455
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

19:24.488 --> 19:25.833
This guy's unbelievable.
Unbelievable.

19:25.857 --> 19:28.059
All right, everyone,
just cool it.

19:28.093 --> 19:30.071
<i>- Now, what the hell happened?
- Oh, what happened?</i>

19:30.095 --> 19:31.535
<i>When Brian had to open
his big mouth,</i>

19:31.562 --> 19:32.596
<i>he had a little speech.</i>

19:32.631 --> 19:33.865
Oh, my god. Go to hell, Tom.

19:33.899 --> 19:34.934
<i>Yeah, you know what?</i>

19:34.967 --> 19:36.434
<i>And you go to outer space,</i>

19:36.468 --> 19:37.837
<i>- far away from us.
- Guys!</i>

19:37.870 --> 19:39.710
We're all just trying
to help Sonny right here.

19:39.739 --> 19:41.617
Oh, wait, Brian's trying
to help Sonny? Since when?

19:41.641 --> 19:43.484
<i>Brenda, honestly, what do you
see in this schmuck?</i>

19:43.508 --> 19:45.745
Oh, you're a big man,
aren't you?

19:45.778 --> 19:47.814
<i>How did this happen?
Why wasn't he at usc?</i>

19:47.847 --> 19:49.758
He moved out when you
got him that new apartment.

19:49.782 --> 19:51.050
<i>So ask him.</i>

19:51.083 --> 19:52.785
He barely returns
my calls anymore.

19:52.819 --> 19:53.986
<i>Welcome to the club.</i>

20:09.501 --> 20:11.037
Oh, kc, is that you?

20:11.070 --> 20:13.873
Hey, mum.
<i>Rosmarinus officinalis.</i>

20:13.906 --> 20:16.108
A few studies have found
that smelling Rosemary

20:16.142 --> 20:18.110
can improve
your short-term memory.

20:18.144 --> 20:21.113
Oh, that's lovely, dear.
Thank you.

20:21.147 --> 20:22.347
Thank you.

20:23.817 --> 20:26.352
Oh, no, no, no, mum.
Let me do that.

20:28.055 --> 20:32.092
There we go.
So, how are you feeling?

20:32.125 --> 20:33.392
Great.

20:33.426 --> 20:34.962
But enough about me.

20:34.995 --> 20:36.529
Everybody here knows

20:36.562 --> 20:39.933
that my son is a genius
working at NASA.

20:40.667 --> 20:41.668
What?

20:43.103 --> 20:44.570
I'm a nobody, mum.

20:44.604 --> 20:46.572
Well, you're somebody to me.

20:46.606 --> 20:48.141
I actually did make a discovery.

20:48.175 --> 20:49.442
But it doesn't matter.

20:51.745 --> 20:53.146
No one will listen to me.

20:53.180 --> 20:54.413
Then make them.

20:58.685 --> 20:59.820
Make them listen?

21:03.023 --> 21:04.825
Oh, hello.

21:04.858 --> 21:06.727
Are you new here?

21:07.828 --> 21:08.996
No, mum.

21:09.997 --> 21:12.133
It's me. It's kc.

21:12.166 --> 21:13.533
Your son.

21:15.203 --> 21:18.106
Can someone tell me
what the hell I'm looking at?

21:18.139 --> 21:20.540
The moon has entered
an elliptical orbit.

21:20.574 --> 21:21.943
Meaning?

21:21.976 --> 21:23.778
It'll circle
around us three times

21:23.811 --> 21:25.479
before it reaches
the roche limit

21:25.512 --> 21:27.614
at 17,000 kilometers.

21:27.649 --> 21:30.885
At that point, city-sized
pieces of moon debris

21:30.919 --> 21:32.921
will rain down on us.

21:32.954 --> 21:34.488
So we have three months?

21:34.521 --> 21:35.757
Not exactly.

21:35.790 --> 21:37.491
As the moon moves closer to us,

21:37.524 --> 21:39.060
our months
will begin to shorten.

21:39.093 --> 21:43.131
We've estimated a timeline
of roughly three weeks.

21:43.164 --> 21:44.933
Maybe less than that.

21:44.966 --> 21:47.035
We have some new high-res
scans that just came in.

21:48.870 --> 21:50.905
Jesus Christ.

21:50.939 --> 21:52.941
Is that a hole
in the crater floor?

21:52.974 --> 21:54.943
So what are our options here?

21:54.976 --> 21:56.610
We have to go back to the moon.

21:56.644 --> 21:58.122
We have to see
what's going on up there.

21:58.146 --> 21:59.648
How do we carry crew?

21:59.682 --> 22:01.192
I've already talked
to my contacts in Europe.

22:01.216 --> 22:03.919
We can potentially get a stc-62

22:03.953 --> 22:05.054
en route by tomorrow.

22:05.087 --> 22:06.188
Potentially?

22:06.221 --> 22:07.856
Great.

22:07.890 --> 22:11.894
I'll just brief the president
on a maybe.

22:11.927 --> 22:14.029
In the meantime, everyone
keep your mouths shut.

22:15.230 --> 22:16.497
Um...

22:17.900 --> 22:20.202
That might be a problem.

22:20.235 --> 22:24.139
It's, uh, trending on Twitter
as of two minutes ago.

22:24.173 --> 22:25.774
It's your ex-husband.

22:25.808 --> 22:27.676
Thank you.

22:27.710 --> 22:30.279
Hey, Doug, I'm a little busy
right now. What is it?

22:30.312 --> 22:31.880
<i>Is it true?</i>

22:31.914 --> 22:33.191
Tell me there's been
some kind of mistake.

22:33.215 --> 22:34.615
<i>I wish I could,</i>

22:34.650 --> 22:36.819
but the math
actually checks out.

22:36.852 --> 22:38.253
<i>So, it's happening.</i>

22:38.287 --> 22:39.955
How's Jimmy?

22:39.989 --> 22:42.257
Well, you'd know if you
saw him once in a while.

22:42.291 --> 22:45.694
Please don't start.
I call him all the time.

22:46.796 --> 22:48.497
Sorry, I gotta run.

22:49.299 --> 22:50.599
Oh...

22:50.633 --> 22:52.702
- Your honor.
- Jesus Christ!

22:52.736 --> 22:54.080
I guess hanging up
wasn't clear enough.

22:54.104 --> 22:55.571
I just need two minutes
of your time.

22:55.604 --> 22:57.741
You have till I reach the door.

22:57.774 --> 22:59.976
I got a classic bike
and my son's vintage mustang

23:00.010 --> 23:01.277
that I can use as collateral

23:01.311 --> 23:02.912
till I get money,
whatever you need.

23:02.946 --> 23:05.682
Are you trying to bribe me?
In a courthouse?

23:05.715 --> 23:07.017
I just wanna get my son back.

23:07.050 --> 23:08.184
The courts are closed.

23:08.218 --> 23:09.719
Will they reopen Monday?

23:09.753 --> 23:11.087
Not likely.

23:11.121 --> 23:12.655
What's that supposed to mean?

23:12.689 --> 23:14.066
Look, I'm just trying
to get the heck outta here

23:14.090 --> 23:15.925
before the traffic
becomes a nightmare.

23:15.959 --> 23:17.703
- I suggest you do the same.

24:37.809 --> 24:38.944
And trust me,

24:38.977 --> 24:41.847
we are not gonna
forget about Sonny.

24:41.880 --> 24:44.149
<i>T-minus five seconds.</i>

24:44.182 --> 24:46.885
<i>Four, three,</i>

24:46.918 --> 24:49.354
<i>two, one.</i>

24:49.387 --> 24:50.422
<i>Ignition.</i>

24:50.455 --> 24:52.290
<i>This is it.</i>

24:52.324 --> 24:53.901
<i>The entire world is holding
its collective breath</i>

24:53.925 --> 24:55.360
<i>as the joint missions
between NASA</i>

24:55.393 --> 24:57.028
<i>and the European space agencies</i>

24:57.062 --> 24:59.097
<i>take to the skies today.</i>

24:59.131 --> 25:00.365
<i>Nations remain hopeful</i>

25:00.398 --> 25:02.234
<i>of NASA's lunar mission</i>

25:02.267 --> 25:04.436
<i>as frantic shoppers continue
to stockpile supplies</i>

25:04.469 --> 25:06.371
<i>as mounting moon terror fuels</i>

25:06.404 --> 25:09.107
<i>the mass migration
out of metropolitan areas.</i>

25:09.141 --> 25:11.244
<i>Civilization has already taken</i>

25:11.277 --> 25:12.979
<i>a serious nosedive.</i>

25:13.012 --> 25:15.181
<i>Looting has become
a favorite pastime</i>

25:15.214 --> 25:16.916
<i>in the United Kingdom.</i>

25:16.949 --> 25:19.285
<i>Fear and
panic have overtaken our city.</i>

25:19.318 --> 25:23.089
<i>The national guard struggles
to restore some kind of order.</i>

25:23.122 --> 25:26.292
<i>Stay awake,
my brothers and sisters.</i>

25:26.325 --> 25:30.329
<i>As the stars fall from heaven,
stay awake!</i>

25:30.363 --> 25:32.131
<i>These armed religious fanatics</i>

25:32.165 --> 25:34.133
<i>have racked up
thousands of followers</i>

25:34.167 --> 25:35.902
<i>all over the country.</i>

25:37.770 --> 25:39.472
<i>In other news,
prominent scientists</i>

25:39.505 --> 25:41.307
<i>are now exploring
the possibility</i>

25:41.340 --> 25:42.909
<i>that perhaps the moon could be</i>

25:42.942 --> 25:44.877
<i>some sort of
orbital megastructure.</i>

25:44.911 --> 25:48.181
<i>A term first popularized
by fringe astronomers,</i>

25:48.214 --> 25:49.815
<i>megastructures describe</i>

25:49.849 --> 25:51.384
<i>artificial planet-sized objects</i>

25:51.417 --> 25:53.819
<i>said to be powered
by captured stars.</i>

25:53.853 --> 25:55.721
<i>This once radical possibility</i>

25:55.755 --> 25:58.124
<i>is now gaining traction
among a scientific community</i>

25:58.157 --> 26:00.227
<i>desperate for answers.</i>

26:06.800 --> 26:08.468
Come out! Hands up!

26:09.403 --> 26:12.206
Easy, easy.

26:12.239 --> 26:14.508
You're that astronaut guy
from the other day.

26:14.541 --> 26:17.110
I accidentally threw away
some very important papers.

26:17.144 --> 26:19.913
Lucky for you, sanitation
hasn't come by all week.

26:19.947 --> 26:22.382
Yeah, it's, uh, lucky for me.

26:26.286 --> 26:27.988
"Orbital distance"?

26:29.189 --> 26:31.091
Are you looking for this?

26:35.028 --> 26:36.763
<i>My fellow megastructurists,</i>

26:36.797 --> 26:38.174
<i>if you're watching this,
then you know by now</i>

26:38.198 --> 26:39.766
<i>a huge problem
is heading our way,</i>

26:39.800 --> 26:41.211
<i>and we're the only ones
who can solve it.</i>

26:41.235 --> 26:42.312
<i>An emergency meeting
is being called,</i>

26:42.336 --> 26:43.770
<i>our usual place immediately.</i>

26:43.804 --> 26:46.173
<i>L.A. palm hotel. Today. 1800.</i>

26:46.206 --> 26:47.809
<i>Free bagels.</i>

26:55.984 --> 26:58.019
<i>Lunar orbit insertion complete.</i>

26:58.052 --> 27:00.088
<i>Houston, we're approaching
the mare crisium.</i>

27:00.121 --> 27:02.557
Initiating capsule rotation.

27:02.590 --> 27:04.125
Affirmative.

27:04.158 --> 27:07.095
<i>15 degrees. 30.</i>

27:08.263 --> 27:12.333
45.70.90.

27:12.367 --> 27:14.035
<i>Stc-62 in position.</i>

27:19.274 --> 27:20.508
Houston, you seeing this?

27:21.876 --> 27:23.978
Copy, we see it.

27:24.012 --> 27:25.380
Prepare to deploy the probe.

27:25.413 --> 27:28.316
Affirmative. Releasing probe.

27:30.285 --> 27:32.086
<i>Stand by for stage two.</i>

27:33.187 --> 27:34.456
<i>Dropping steadily.</i>

27:51.240 --> 27:53.175
<i>I posted on every platform.</i>

27:53.208 --> 27:55.611
<i>Why don't those idiots at NASA
see the real problem?</i>

27:55.645 --> 27:57.246
<i>Because they obviously
haven't read</i>

27:57.279 --> 27:59.181
<i>famed cosmologist
Carl sagan's work,</i>

27:59.214 --> 28:01.050
<i>where he clearly states</i>

28:01.083 --> 28:02.994
<i>that a natural satellite
cannot be a hollow object.</i>

28:03.018 --> 28:06.322
I... I've been saying that
for years, Dr. Houseman.

28:06.355 --> 28:08.290
<i>That doesn't help us now,
does it, Ziggy?</i>

28:08.324 --> 28:10.192
<i>This room is full
of the smartest</i>

28:10.225 --> 28:11.894
<i>and most visionary people
in the world.</i>

28:13.663 --> 28:15.507
<i>We all know the moon's
a constructed object. Okay?</i>

28:15.531 --> 28:17.066
<i>There has to be a way to fix it.</i>

28:17.099 --> 28:20.135
<i>Come on, people,
think outside the box.</i>

28:20.169 --> 28:21.870
Oswald did it.

28:21.904 --> 28:23.206
<i>Oh, damn it, Gary. Not now.</i>

28:27.177 --> 28:28.178
<i>Mr. Harper.</i>

28:29.446 --> 28:30.980
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

28:31.014 --> 28:33.249
Probably making a huge mistake.

28:33.283 --> 28:34.551
Can we talk?

28:37.087 --> 28:38.207
How did you know I was here?

28:39.422 --> 28:40.423
Your website.

28:41.424 --> 28:43.059
You read my blog?

28:43.093 --> 28:45.161
You knew all this was
happening before anyone.

28:45.195 --> 28:47.931
Before NASA. How?

28:47.964 --> 28:49.265
Why bother?

28:49.299 --> 28:51.067
You're just gonna say
I'm crazy again.

28:51.101 --> 28:53.002
Try me.

28:53.036 --> 28:55.605
Well, for years I've been
studying distant planets,

28:55.639 --> 28:57.941
searching for one of
these orbiting megastructures.

28:57.974 --> 28:59.609
But I never could have imagined

28:59.643 --> 29:01.077
there'd be one right here,

29:01.111 --> 29:03.079
in our own backyard.

29:04.180 --> 29:05.448
Ever heard of a Dyson sphere?

29:06.449 --> 29:07.951
Yeah.

29:07.984 --> 29:09.452
Every megastructure
has a rigid shell

29:09.486 --> 29:11.155
built around a power core.

29:11.188 --> 29:13.224
Most likely
a captured white dwarf

29:13.257 --> 29:14.992
that's being harnessed
for energy.

29:15.025 --> 29:18.162
Something obviously happened
to the one inside our moon

29:18.195 --> 29:20.531
and that's why
it's veering off course.

29:22.533 --> 29:24.101
Yeah, still crazy.

29:27.004 --> 29:28.239
Why did you come here

29:28.272 --> 29:29.282
if you're not going
to believe me?

29:29.306 --> 29:30.417
'Cause I know what it's like

29:30.441 --> 29:31.652
to try to tell people something

29:31.676 --> 29:33.277
and have no one listen.

29:35.012 --> 29:37.982
Probe depth
has reached 24.5 kilometers.

29:38.683 --> 29:39.917
25 kilometers.

29:43.087 --> 29:45.122
Holding steady
at 25.6 kilometers.

29:48.159 --> 29:49.728
Still holding.

29:49.761 --> 29:52.396
- It stopped?
- It's coming back.

29:52.430 --> 29:54.365
24 kilometers.

29:54.766 --> 29:56.267
20.

29:56.300 --> 29:57.601
15.

29:57.635 --> 30:00.138
We got another problem.

30:00.172 --> 30:01.641
The moon's orbit
is shifting again.

30:01.674 --> 30:03.542
What?

30:03.575 --> 30:05.310
It's correcting itself.

30:10.582 --> 30:12.050
Uh, Houston,

30:12.083 --> 30:13.729
we're experiencing
some kind of malfunction.

30:13.753 --> 30:15.187
<i>Houston, do you copy?</i>

30:15.220 --> 30:16.756
<i>Houston, do you copy?</i>

30:23.495 --> 30:24.996
What the hell is that?

30:25.030 --> 30:26.031
I don't know.

30:30.635 --> 30:32.571
Hull breach. Helmets.

31:28.461 --> 31:29.663
<i>In breaking news,</i>

31:29.696 --> 31:31.397
<i>NASA has just corrected</i>

31:31.430 --> 31:33.065
<i>their initial projection...</i>

31:33.099 --> 31:35.168
<i>Of the moon's path over earth.</i>

31:40.742 --> 31:42.509
<i>The governor has just ordered</i>

31:42.543 --> 31:45.713
<i>the mass evacuation
of the entire west coast,</i>

31:45.747 --> 31:47.281
<i>recommending that people</i>

31:47.314 --> 31:49.349
<i>urgently head to higher ground.</i>

31:49.383 --> 31:51.719
<i>As the moon
keeps closing in on earth</i>

31:51.753 --> 31:53.655
<i>in a chaotic,
and as one scientist put it...</i>

32:08.635 --> 32:10.270
Guys!

32:10.304 --> 32:12.272
The... the...
The tide, it's coming.

32:12.306 --> 32:13.583
Come on.
We gotta get outta here.

32:13.607 --> 32:14.608
Wait!

32:32.193 --> 32:33.805
Everybody, upstairs. Go!
Everybody, get up!

32:33.829 --> 32:35.196
Come on! Go, go!

32:38.867 --> 32:40.401
Kc, what are you doing?

32:40.435 --> 32:42.136
Kc!

32:48.376 --> 32:49.645
Kc, hang on!

32:54.415 --> 32:55.516
I can't swim!

32:55.550 --> 32:56.551
Dr. Houseman!

32:57.251 --> 32:58.453
Hang on!

33:06.327 --> 33:07.796
He's right there.
He's right there.

33:08.664 --> 33:09.865
Hang on!

33:13.435 --> 33:15.270
Come on!

33:16.806 --> 33:17.807
Come on.

33:22.779 --> 33:23.780
Come on.

33:31.855 --> 33:35.759
It's some kind of self-aware,
self-replicating singularity.

33:35.792 --> 33:37.393
Like a machine?

33:37.426 --> 33:39.628
Machines don't have
intelligence. This does.

33:39.663 --> 33:42.197
It's everything
we feared about a.I.

33:42.231 --> 33:43.399
And it knew we were coming.

33:43.432 --> 33:44.834
So it was probably drawn out

33:44.868 --> 33:47.369
by the electronic signature
of the capsule.

33:47.403 --> 33:48.705
Everything we thought we knew

33:48.738 --> 33:50.372
about the nature of the universe

33:50.406 --> 33:53.208
has just gone out the window.

33:56.012 --> 33:58.314
We're not prepared for this.

34:01.251 --> 34:04.689
Deb, don't argue, just pack
your stuff. We're leaving.

34:06.623 --> 34:07.825
So you're just gonna quit?

34:07.858 --> 34:09.359
What do you want me to do?

34:09.391 --> 34:10.771
I want you to help us
figure out what

34:10.795 --> 34:12.304
the hell this thing is,
so we can beat it.

34:12.328 --> 34:13.596
We're not equipped for that.

34:13.630 --> 34:15.766
You've seen
what we're up against.

34:15.800 --> 34:17.935
You've been gunning for my job
for a while, Fowler.

34:17.967 --> 34:20.303
Congrats, it's yours.

34:20.335 --> 34:21.603
What are you not telling me?

34:21.638 --> 34:23.339
You've got q clearance.

34:23.373 --> 34:25.442
The hole is in the mare crisium.

34:25.475 --> 34:28.012
That's what the Harper
hearings were all about.

34:28.045 --> 34:31.481
If you're serious about going
down the NASA rabbit hole,

34:31.514 --> 34:33.717
you should pay a visit
to holdenfield.

34:34.885 --> 34:35.886
Here's your clearance.

35:13.491 --> 35:15.026
<i>How did you get down here?</i>

35:15.060 --> 35:16.828
<i>Hutchings gave me this.</i>

35:16.862 --> 35:19.731
<i>I'll need all records
of stx-136a.</i>

35:29.841 --> 35:31.743
You waiting for something?

35:44.857 --> 35:46.025
<i>What the hell is that?</i>

35:51.630 --> 35:52.631
<i>I feel it.</i>

35:57.904 --> 35:59.005
What are you doing?

36:01.473 --> 36:02.875
Holdenfield?

36:02.909 --> 36:07.046
You're not supposed
to have that, 136 Alpha.

36:08.380 --> 36:11.449
That's classified. Top secret.

36:11.483 --> 36:13.585
Why is NASA
lying about all this?

36:14.419 --> 36:16.923
July 20th, 1969.

36:16.956 --> 36:18.958
"One small step for man,

36:18.991 --> 36:21.727
"one giant leap for..."
Yada, yada, yada.

36:21.761 --> 36:23.964
In school,
you were taught that Apollo 11

36:23.997 --> 36:26.532
lost contact
with mission control

36:26.566 --> 36:29.635
for two minutes. Not true.

36:29.670 --> 36:33.073
Mission control
cut their feed to the world

36:33.106 --> 36:35.976
because they found something
on that day.

36:36.009 --> 36:38.846
Strange pulsating lights

36:38.879 --> 36:42.515
emanating from beneath
the moon's crust.

36:42.548 --> 36:47.154
It was me who was assigned
to keep it under wraps.

36:47.187 --> 36:50.657
The Apollo crew played ball.
Everybody after.

36:50.691 --> 36:52.826
Just Brian Harper wouldn't.

36:52.860 --> 36:55.095
They called him crazy.

36:55.128 --> 36:56.596
Threw him out with the trash.

36:56.629 --> 36:58.932
You're telling me that the moon

36:58.966 --> 37:02.535
was effectively the biggest
cover-up in human history?

37:04.838 --> 37:07.107
Biggest? Probably.

37:07.140 --> 37:10.477
You had blood
on your hands, too.

37:10.510 --> 37:13.413
Yeah, well,
anyone who follows orders

37:13.447 --> 37:16.550
pretty much always does,
don't they?

37:16.583 --> 37:20.154
That technology,
it's light years ahead of us.

37:20.188 --> 37:23.658
Compared to that,
we're the stone age.

37:24.859 --> 37:29.097
The only shot we had to stop it

37:29.130 --> 37:31.598
was zulu X-ray 7.

37:31.632 --> 37:34.468
It was shut down. Shelved.

37:34.501 --> 37:37.005
For budgetary reasons.

37:37.038 --> 37:39.707
Well, commander,
I have pressing business

37:39.741 --> 37:42.409
waiting for me on my desk.

37:43.878 --> 37:45.713
The sand in the hourglass

37:45.747 --> 37:48.515
is dropping quickly
for all of us.

37:48.548 --> 37:50.818
It's as good as gone.

37:50.852 --> 37:52.687
I'm really sorry.

37:53.688 --> 37:55.023
Really.

38:08.003 --> 38:09.004
Damn it.

38:10.873 --> 38:12.540
What's wrong?

38:12.573 --> 38:13.976
I can't reach my son.

38:14.009 --> 38:15.110
Uh...

38:15.144 --> 38:17.913
Word is, um,
you're an astronaut,

38:18.747 --> 38:20.683
so you must know that

38:20.716 --> 38:23.986
the entire inside of the moon

38:24.019 --> 38:26.188
is full of produce.

38:26.221 --> 38:27.923
Kc, can you tell
birkenstocks here

38:27.957 --> 38:30.125
that I'm dangerously close
to hurling him out a window?

38:30.159 --> 38:32.861
Okay, well,
let's find an empty room.

38:32.895 --> 38:34.964
How do you think
the incas got their potatoes?

38:35.731 --> 38:37.166
Sorry.

38:37.199 --> 38:38.968
You said that if we can
destroy this thing...

38:39.001 --> 38:40.970
<i>We have a theory</i>

38:41.003 --> 38:43.604
<i>that the moon might return
to its original orbit.</i>

38:43.638 --> 38:46.843
And how do you propose
we do that exactly?

38:46.876 --> 38:48.144
You said so yourself,

38:48.178 --> 38:51.181
using a modern spacecraft
is not feasible.

38:51.214 --> 38:53.016
<i>I am working on a solution.</i>

38:53.049 --> 38:54.550
We appreciate your effort,

38:54.583 --> 38:56.219
but this is now
a military operation.

38:56.252 --> 38:58.221
We'll take it from here.

39:01.858 --> 39:03.693
<i>Doug! Wait!</i>

39:03.727 --> 39:05.862
<i>If you launch nukes,</i>

39:05.895 --> 39:08.530
<i>the global fallout
is gonna kill everybody.</i>

39:08.564 --> 39:10.066
Who said anything about nukes?

39:10.100 --> 39:12.669
<i>You are making
a big mistake here.</i>

39:12.702 --> 39:14.671
<i>Please,
let me put together a plan.</i>

39:14.704 --> 39:16.172
We have a plan.

39:18.775 --> 39:23.880
Look, why don't you and Jimmy
come with me to Colorado?

39:23.913 --> 39:25.647
You'll be safe there.

39:25.682 --> 39:28.584
<i>What are you asking me to do?
Quit? Give up?</i>

39:28.617 --> 39:30.954
I'm asking you
to think about our son.

39:30.987 --> 39:34.825
<i>I am thinking about our son.</i>

39:42.033 --> 39:43.267
Where is he?

39:44.301 --> 39:45.736
Uh, jail.

39:47.872 --> 39:49.840
He's a good kid,
just made a mistake.

39:49.874 --> 39:52.810
I was always
doing stupid things.

39:52.843 --> 39:55.046
Don't know how my parents
put up with me.

39:55.079 --> 39:56.814
We never had a lot of money,

39:56.847 --> 39:58.983
but sometimes
we'd all get fish 'n chips,

39:59.016 --> 40:00.151
sit out on the dock

40:00.184 --> 40:03.020
and just watch the stars
for hours.

40:04.955 --> 40:06.995
That was when I first dreamed
of being an astronaut.

40:08.859 --> 40:12.663
After my father passed,

40:12.696 --> 40:16.233
my mum wanted to move
back to the states.

40:16.267 --> 40:19.804
My dad laughed when I told him
I wanted to be an astronaut.

40:19.837 --> 40:21.604
Didn't believe in you?

40:21.639 --> 40:23.842
Oh, that's putting it lightly.

40:23.875 --> 40:26.945
I worked my ass off
to get into NASA.

40:26.978 --> 40:28.947
I read all about
your last mission.

40:28.980 --> 40:30.916
You saw alien tech.

40:30.949 --> 40:33.051
And NASA insisted
it was a meteor.

40:33.852 --> 40:35.253
But it wasn't?

40:35.287 --> 40:37.722
It was unlike anything
I'd ever seen.

40:37.756 --> 40:39.024
And, you know, the worst part

40:40.358 --> 40:42.894
is I lost a friend up there.

40:42.928 --> 40:44.162
And it was my fault.

40:44.196 --> 40:45.864
Oh, come on.
How was it your fault?

40:45.897 --> 40:48.400
You saved the shuttle.
You saved Fowler.

40:48.433 --> 40:49.901
A lot of good that did.

40:49.935 --> 40:52.204
I'm divorced, broke,
my son hates me.

40:52.237 --> 40:54.206
God, I am so jealous.

40:54.239 --> 40:57.209
Alien tech.

40:57.242 --> 40:58.376
It's freakin' awesome.

41:05.317 --> 41:06.885
<i>Extreme weather is hammering</i>

41:06.918 --> 41:09.221
<i>the eastern seaboard
and Gulf coast</i>

41:09.254 --> 41:11.057
<i>with high tides and flooding</i>

41:11.090 --> 41:13.693
<i>wreaking havoc
on residents and properties.</i>

41:13.726 --> 41:15.404
<i>Folks, if you aren't
already on high ground,</i>

41:15.428 --> 41:16.872
<i>you better get there
as soon as possible.</i>

41:16.896 --> 41:19.165
Um, as an exchange student,

41:19.198 --> 41:21.767
are you sure they're going
to let me into the bunker?

41:21.801 --> 41:23.712
Yeah. Don't worry about it.
I'll take care of it.

41:23.736 --> 41:25.371
Thank you.

41:25.404 --> 41:27.240
<i>And loss of life
in populated areas.</i>

41:27.273 --> 41:29.017
<i>As you can see, the images
coming out of Bangladesh</i>

41:29.041 --> 41:32.178
- <i>are simply horrific</i>
- mom, are we gonna die?

41:32.211 --> 41:33.913
No. No, sweetheart.

41:33.946 --> 41:35.882
I know all of this
that's happening

41:35.915 --> 41:37.016
seems so scary,

41:37.049 --> 41:39.418
but we are not gonna die. Okay?

41:39.452 --> 41:41.687
We're all gonna be safe
with dad in Colorado.

41:41.721 --> 41:43.890
Are you sending more
rockets to the moon?

41:44.724 --> 41:46.459
No. No. You know why?

41:46.492 --> 41:47.894
Because we don't...

41:47.927 --> 41:48.971
We don't have any more of these.

41:48.995 --> 41:50.196
Why not?

41:50.229 --> 41:52.165
Because they're all in museums.

41:54.333 --> 41:55.768
And, um...

41:56.969 --> 41:58.005
Uh...

42:00.040 --> 42:01.408
I love you, sweetheart.

42:03.110 --> 42:04.378
<i>Hey, Doug.</i>

42:05.179 --> 42:07.247
What is a zx-7?

42:07.281 --> 42:08.782
<i>Who told you about that?</i>

42:08.815 --> 42:10.350
<i>Well, come on. What is it?</i>

42:10.384 --> 42:15.389
Zulu X-ray seven
was a prototype emp device.

42:15.422 --> 42:17.191
But the program got disbanded.

42:17.224 --> 42:20.294
Okay, well, it's clear that
this thing inside the moon

42:20.327 --> 42:22.229
is technological
in nature, right?

42:22.262 --> 42:24.498
<i>I assume they thought an emp
could take the thing out.</i>

42:24.531 --> 42:27.334
We don't have a way into space
so this is a moot point.

42:27.367 --> 42:29.770
<i>Okay, well, how far along
was the testing?</i>

42:31.772 --> 42:34.241
Jocinda, NASA isn't cleared
for another mission.

42:34.274 --> 42:36.210
How about you let me
worry about that?

42:41.315 --> 42:43.083
<i>GPS is locked on lz.</i>

42:43.116 --> 42:45.954
<i>Compensate latitude
by minus 4.5 west.</i>

42:45.987 --> 42:48.389
<i>4.5 degrees. Copy.</i>

42:48.423 --> 42:50.124
<i>Reducing to 10 knots.</i>

43:02.370 --> 43:04.172
Open the door.

43:05.540 --> 43:07.242
Yeah?

43:07.275 --> 43:09.244
- Brian Harper?
- Yeah.

43:09.277 --> 43:10.545
We need you to come with us.

43:10.578 --> 43:12.513
It's a matter
of national security.

43:12.547 --> 43:14.816
All right. Give me a second.

43:14.849 --> 43:16.317
I'm not going anywhere
without him.

43:16.351 --> 43:18.186
Yeah, we're a team.

43:22.423 --> 43:24.459
Oh. Sorry, I'm sorry, miss.

43:26.494 --> 43:27.495
Sorry.

43:31.833 --> 43:33.268
Oh, sorry, sorry.

43:35.838 --> 43:39.108
It's been nearly three hours.
That can't be a good sign.

43:40.976 --> 43:42.220
What's with
all the pill popping?

43:42.244 --> 43:43.255
You're really sweating
over there.

43:43.279 --> 43:45.481
- You okay?
- Yeah.

43:49.151 --> 43:52.821
No. I broke into uc irvine
multiple times.

43:52.855 --> 43:54.156
I lost two of their mops.

43:56.558 --> 43:58.093
They probably know.

44:01.096 --> 44:03.999
Oh, you gotta be kidding me. No.

44:04.033 --> 44:05.610
Look, I don't want to be here
any more than you do.

44:05.634 --> 44:07.336
Sit down.

44:07.369 --> 44:09.414
No, no, no. I don't have to
take orders from you anymore.

44:09.438 --> 44:11.607
I'm just curious, you still
screwing over your friends?

44:11.640 --> 44:13.351
- Oh, you talking about me?
- How many of these

44:13.375 --> 44:14.586
- wonderful people here...
- Really?

44:14.610 --> 44:15.878
Guys!

44:19.348 --> 44:20.482
Who the hell is this?

44:22.185 --> 44:25.255
Dr. Kc houseman, ma'am.

44:25.288 --> 44:28.925
I wrote you several e-mails,
but you never responded.

44:32.162 --> 44:33.530
What's this all about?

44:34.230 --> 44:35.432
Follow me.

44:39.636 --> 44:41.137
What you're about to see,

44:41.171 --> 44:43.139
only a handful of people
have ever seen before.

44:43.173 --> 44:44.417
Kc knew the moon
was out of orbit

44:44.441 --> 44:45.975
before you guys did.

44:46.009 --> 44:50.113
Social media went wild
when I posted my research.

44:50.146 --> 44:51.548
You're the
"unidentified source"?

44:51.581 --> 44:52.849
Oh, yes.

44:53.583 --> 44:54.918
Oh, god.

44:57.253 --> 45:00.056
Mosley, pull up
the tunnel, please.

45:02.592 --> 45:04.294
Our readings estimate its depth

45:04.327 --> 45:06.496
to be over 25 kilometers.

45:06.529 --> 45:07.597
That's the mare crisium.

45:07.630 --> 45:09.132
Exactly.

45:09.165 --> 45:11.068
I think whatever happened
all those years ago

45:11.102 --> 45:12.169
is directly responsible

45:12.203 --> 45:13.313
for what's happening right now.

45:13.337 --> 45:15.039
Oh, so you believe me now?

45:15.072 --> 45:16.540
I saw your helmet cam.

45:16.574 --> 45:18.275
It's a little late
for an apology.

45:18.309 --> 45:20.411
We were both lied to.

45:20.444 --> 45:23.080
The international mission
didn't just go sideways.

45:23.114 --> 45:24.382
It was attacked.

45:24.415 --> 45:27.251
A technological life form.

45:27.284 --> 45:28.986
No effin' way.

45:29.019 --> 45:30.659
During the attack,
the moon was attempting

45:30.689 --> 45:32.356
to return to its original orbit,

45:32.390 --> 45:35.559
until this thing
went back inside the moon.

45:35.593 --> 45:38.529
This is what
I've been trying to tell you.

45:38.562 --> 45:40.708
It's doing something to the
megastructure's power core.

45:40.732 --> 45:42.166
Excuse me. The megastructure?

45:42.199 --> 45:43.567
Please don't ask.

45:43.601 --> 45:46.337
It's highly likely our
moon was built by aliens.

45:46.370 --> 45:48.572
We have to get inside
and make first contact.

45:48.606 --> 45:49.640
I told you not to ask.

45:49.674 --> 45:51.175
All right, look,

45:51.208 --> 45:52.986
we're planning a mission
to attack this thing.

45:53.010 --> 45:54.311
The only problem is,

45:54.345 --> 45:56.614
is it recognizes our technology.

45:57.582 --> 46:01.186
Which is why we need you.

46:01.219 --> 46:03.922
Well, I never thought
I'd hear you say that again.

46:04.623 --> 46:06.091
You're the only pilot

46:06.124 --> 46:07.402
to ever land a shuttle
without power.

46:07.426 --> 46:09.494
Not exactly a hirable skill.

46:09.528 --> 46:11.129
Well, it is right now,

46:11.163 --> 46:14.566
which is why I'm offering
you your job back,

46:14.599 --> 46:18.937
and I'm personally
asking you for your help.

46:20.305 --> 46:21.640
Say yes, Brian.

46:27.780 --> 46:30.048
I don't know.

46:30.081 --> 46:32.284
I got a lot of my own
problems down here.

46:32.317 --> 46:35.587
And the moon falling onto earth

46:35.620 --> 46:37.690
isn't one of them?

46:37.723 --> 46:41.092
I was wrong to bring you here.
I am done.

46:41.126 --> 46:42.762
How do you plan
on getting up there?

46:42.795 --> 46:46.032
You know all of our shuttles
are in museums.

46:46.065 --> 46:47.701
The <i>endeavour</i>
is right here in L.A.

46:47.734 --> 46:51.204
Plus, the Chinese are offering
their prototype moon lander.

46:51.237 --> 46:53.105
I know it sounds
completely crazy.

46:53.139 --> 46:55.041
No, no,
what you showed us was crazy.

46:55.074 --> 46:58.044
This is a whole other
level of insane.

46:58.077 --> 47:00.146
Ought to be right up
your alley then, no?

47:02.148 --> 47:03.149
If I do this,

47:05.084 --> 47:07.220
I'm gonna need
something in return.

47:10.323 --> 47:12.492
Clear! All clear over here.

47:12.525 --> 47:14.460
Staircase on your left.

47:14.494 --> 47:15.762
Keep your eyes open.

47:18.197 --> 47:19.632
Did you reach him?

47:19.666 --> 47:22.568
Yeah. It's being handled.

47:22.602 --> 47:24.771
Sonny's gonna meet us
at vandenberg.

47:24.805 --> 47:27.073
Looks like we missed the party.

47:27.106 --> 47:28.508
I didn't even get an invite.

47:30.510 --> 47:32.713
At least somebody's
on the same page as us.

47:37.785 --> 47:40.688
Hey, hey. Look what I found!

47:40.722 --> 47:42.523
Maybe we can use it
as toilet paper.

47:42.556 --> 47:44.826
- What?
- Take a look around you, man.

47:44.859 --> 47:47.394
- It's worthless.
- Whatever. Let's go.

47:48.696 --> 47:50.531
<i>Attention,</i>

47:50.564 --> 47:53.400
<i>we are asking everyone

<i>and to remain indoors...</i>

47:56.303 --> 47:58.071
Dude, dude, we gotta
get outta here. Go!

48:06.814 --> 48:10.183
Yeah. This is really,
really exciting, isn't it?

48:13.554 --> 48:15.122
<i>As leaders around the world</i>

48:15.155 --> 48:16.691

48:19.259 --> 48:21.496
<i>might have plans

48:21.529 --> 48:23.464
<i>But so far, NASA

<i>from our correspondent

<i>Apparently, the moon

<i>Reports of countless earthquakes</i>

48:37.645 --> 48:39.447
That's weird.

48:39.480 --> 48:41.349
What's weird?

48:41.382 --> 48:43.127
The moon doesn't have
enough gravity to do that,

48:43.151 --> 48:44.687
no matter how close it gets.

48:45.688 --> 48:47.322
You still don't get it.

48:47.355 --> 48:49.490
We're dealing
with a megastructure.

48:49.524 --> 48:52.728
Your rules don't apply anymore.

48:52.761 --> 48:54.763
We've been here how long now,

48:54.797 --> 48:57.700
and nobody's bothered
to paint over that?

48:57.733 --> 48:59.400
It's kinda growing on me.

49:00.234 --> 49:01.569
Hey, where's Sonny?

49:01.603 --> 49:02.914
I sent a ground crew
to the prison, okay?

49:02.938 --> 49:04.807
But I haven't heard anything
in a few days.

49:04.840 --> 49:06.341
Why the hell
didn't you say that?

49:06.374 --> 49:07.614
'Cause I need you to be focused

49:07.642 --> 49:09.278
on what's happening right here.

49:12.682 --> 49:14.483
Megastructures
move through space

49:14.516 --> 49:15.785
without an exhaust system.

49:15.819 --> 49:17.553
The moon has an engine?

49:18.922 --> 49:20.790
Hold that thought.
I'll be right back.

49:23.760 --> 49:25.862
Well, at least your husband
came through with that.

49:25.895 --> 49:27.529
Ex-husband.

49:39.341 --> 49:40.777
- Colonel.
- Director Fowler.

49:40.810 --> 49:42.712
Commander Harper.
I'm lieutenant colonel Reed.

49:42.746 --> 49:44.580
This is captain Avery.

49:44.613 --> 49:46.415
We've been briefed
by general Davidson.

49:46.448 --> 49:48.617
We need to walk you
through the arming procedure.

49:48.651 --> 49:50.552
I'm an astronaut, not a soldier.

49:50.586 --> 49:51.831
I'll get you
where you need to go,

49:51.855 --> 49:53.188
but I'm not setting off
any bomb.

49:53.222 --> 49:54.490
We don't expect you to.

49:54.523 --> 49:55.959
We'll accompany you
on the mission

49:55.992 --> 49:57.594
and activate the device,

49:57.627 --> 49:58.839
but you need to be familiar
with the process

49:58.863 --> 50:00.397
should complications arise.

50:03.968 --> 50:05.646
The bomb's security
and authentication systems

50:05.670 --> 50:06.804
have been removed.

50:06.837 --> 50:08.238
Meaning we can arm it

50:08.271 --> 50:09.548
without approval
from the ground.

50:09.572 --> 50:11.574
Using a remote trigger.

50:11.608 --> 50:14.644
Two clicks,
then push this down and hold.

50:14.679 --> 50:16.179
Triggers the device to go off.

50:17.380 --> 50:19.717
- Simple.
- Yeah. Simple.

50:24.755 --> 50:27.223
Nearing vandenberg, captain.
Over.

50:27.257 --> 50:28.458
Roger that.

50:32.897 --> 50:35.265
Should've gotten you
the jumbo platter.

50:35.298 --> 50:37.600
Thank you for getting me out.

50:37.634 --> 50:38.769
You can thank your dad.

50:44.008 --> 50:45.443
Plan is to take off

50:45.476 --> 50:47.311
when the moon
is closest to earth.

50:47.344 --> 50:49.547
Now, since we're dealing
with an unpredictable target,

50:49.580 --> 50:51.515
navigation is gonna be crucial.

50:52.550 --> 50:54.318
Our navigator, Carl Saunders,

50:54.351 --> 50:56.021
is gonna be making sure
we hit the Mark,

50:56.054 --> 50:57.455
flight engineer Hannah Martin

50:57.488 --> 50:59.457
will run real-time calculations

50:59.490 --> 51:01.993
to ensure
that we intercept the moon.

51:02.027 --> 51:03.494
And once
we clear the atmosphere,

51:03.527 --> 51:05.262
we'll begin
the refueling process.

51:05.296 --> 51:07.398
Thankfully our friends at SpaceX

51:07.431 --> 51:09.901
have a propellant depot
currently in orbit.

51:09.935 --> 51:11.402
I love elon.

51:14.538 --> 51:16.407
So once we're all powered off,

51:16.440 --> 51:18.342
we'll use our thrusters
to position ourselves

51:18.375 --> 51:19.745
over the mare crisium.

51:19.778 --> 51:21.278
Our Chinese friends

51:21.312 --> 51:22.881
have Jerry-rigged
the on board systems

51:22.914 --> 51:25.583
so that we can fly it
without electronics.

51:25.616 --> 51:27.585
So we'll park the rover
section of the module

51:27.618 --> 51:29.353
with the bomb inside,

51:29.386 --> 51:31.957
then switch the electronics
back on

51:31.990 --> 51:33.425
and use it as bait

51:33.458 --> 51:35.895
to lure this thing
out of its hole.

51:35.928 --> 51:38.563
Then, you guys
will pull the trigger

51:38.597 --> 51:40.700
and kill it.

51:42.567 --> 51:45.637
And then, hopefully,
we all can go back home.

51:45.671 --> 51:47.472
If we still have one left.

51:49.976 --> 51:51.409
What did I say?

51:51.443 --> 51:54.080
Sonny. Oh, my god, son.

51:54.113 --> 51:55.748
- Thank god you're okay.
- Thank you.

51:57.415 --> 51:58.684
- Hold on.
- Okay.

51:58.718 --> 51:59.986
Just so I'm clear,

52:00.019 --> 52:01.854
you're gonna take
a bomb into space.

52:01.888 --> 52:05.323
And why are you even here?
You hate NASA.

52:05.357 --> 52:07.026
Just try to understand.
If there's even

52:07.059 --> 52:08.704
the smallest chance
that this could work...

52:08.728 --> 52:12.430
- What if it doesn't?
- It has to.

52:12.464 --> 52:14.901
I want you to have a world
you can grow up in.

52:14.934 --> 52:17.469
Where you can be
a better man than me.

52:20.039 --> 52:22.042
Hey.

52:24.477 --> 52:26.412
What have you seen
since you've been there?

52:26.445 --> 52:28.548
<i>The space shuttle and stuff.</i>

52:28.581 --> 52:29.883
Do you miss me?

52:29.917 --> 52:31.919
Yeah, I really miss you.

52:31.952 --> 52:34.087
I miss you too, my little man.

52:34.121 --> 52:35.521
<i>Is mom around?</i>

52:38.792 --> 52:40.526
Mom, it's dad.

52:47.500 --> 52:48.869
Wow, he's getting good.

52:49.502 --> 52:50.704
Yeah?

52:50.737 --> 52:53.674
I held up my end of the bargain.

52:53.707 --> 52:55.575
<i>I want you and Jimmy
in Colorado.</i>

52:55.608 --> 52:57.811
We are. We're gonna be
airlifted out of here

52:57.845 --> 52:59.847
<i>as soon as the shuttle launches.</i>

52:59.880 --> 53:01.414
Look, if anyone finds out

53:01.447 --> 53:03.583
- what I've done for you...
- <i>They won't.</i>

53:03.616 --> 53:06.687
You just make sure
your trigger-happy buddies

53:06.720 --> 53:08.554
keep their hands off the nukes.

53:12.160 --> 53:13.862
Sorry, guys.

53:13.895 --> 53:16.030
Out of two percent.
I looked everywhere.

53:16.064 --> 53:18.665
Nah, this is great. Thanks, man.

53:18.700 --> 53:20.935
You know,
I almost got a job at NASA.

53:20.969 --> 53:22.603
What department?

53:22.636 --> 53:23.637
Janitorial.

53:34.648 --> 53:35.750
Get out!

53:37.819 --> 53:39.020
Hang on!

53:52.834 --> 53:55.069
Is this your current
projected lunar orbit?

53:55.103 --> 53:56.603
- Yeah.
- Why?

53:56.637 --> 53:57.782
This obviously isn't accounting

53:57.806 --> 53:59.909
for the moon's increased mass.

53:59.942 --> 54:01.476
Look at
all this seismic activity

54:01.509 --> 54:03.712
in the wake of its orbit.

54:03.746 --> 54:05.848
We know
the moon's surface gravity

54:05.881 --> 54:07.917
is 1.62 meters squared.

54:07.950 --> 54:09.417
At least it used to be.

54:10.119 --> 54:12.755
So this must be wrong.

54:18.794 --> 54:19.929
I'm sorry, director Fowler,

54:19.962 --> 54:21.230
we have a problem.

54:21.263 --> 54:22.998
Just what we need,
a damn earthquake.

54:23.032 --> 54:24.632
We're losing coolant.

54:24.666 --> 54:26.168
Well, there has to be
a way to fix it.

54:26.201 --> 54:28.170
Not here. We would need
the entire team at michoud

54:28.203 --> 54:29.637
to rebuild something like this.

54:29.672 --> 54:30.906
Well, then get on the horn

54:30.940 --> 54:32.473
and find somebody
who can help us.

54:32.507 --> 54:35.010
Anyone that can help us
is already here.

54:41.616 --> 54:42.818
Look,

54:42.851 --> 54:44.552
we have to think about

54:44.585 --> 54:46.723
letting all of these people here

54:46.756 --> 54:47.924
get to safety.

54:47.958 --> 54:49.558
To safety?

54:49.591 --> 54:51.527
These people here
won't have a planet

54:51.560 --> 54:53.495
unless we figure something out.

54:53.529 --> 54:55.631
Brian, we're down an engine.

54:56.866 --> 54:59.002
Launching is no longer
an option.

54:59.035 --> 55:00.804
Thanks for bringing me here.

55:08.211 --> 55:09.611
<i>May I have everyone's attention.</i>

55:11.281 --> 55:15.885
<i>You've all done more
than we ever could have asked.</i>

55:15.919 --> 55:18.788
<i>You have my deepest thanks</i>

55:18.822 --> 55:21.958
<i>along with the thanks
of the entire country.</i>

55:21.992 --> 55:24.761
<i>But it's now time
for you to go home.</i>

55:24.794 --> 55:27.563
<i>I'm ordering
the immediate evacuation</i>

55:27.596 --> 55:29.899
<i>of all personnel
from vandenberg.</i>

55:29.933 --> 55:33.004
<i>You'll meet up with
your families in Colorado.</i>

55:35.006 --> 55:36.073
Dad.

55:37.208 --> 55:38.508
I'm sorry it didn't work out.

55:39.744 --> 55:41.145
Story of my life.

55:42.913 --> 55:44.982
Thanks for getting me
out of jail.

55:47.785 --> 55:49.619
Let's get our stuff.
It's time to go.

55:58.195 --> 55:59.629
Time's up.

55:59.662 --> 56:01.298
Chopper's ready.
Come on. Let's go.

56:07.304 --> 56:08.839
Go ahead.
I'll meet you out there.

56:08.873 --> 56:10.107
Why are you guys still here?

56:10.141 --> 56:12.642
Director Fowler,
when it comes back around,

56:12.676 --> 56:15.246
the moon's gravity will be
over 80% of the earth's pull.

56:15.279 --> 56:16.714
I know how it sounds,

56:16.747 --> 56:17.924
but we checked
Dr. Houseman's data.

56:17.948 --> 56:19.250
The numbers are solid.

56:19.283 --> 56:20.986
Show the director
our new simulations.

56:21.019 --> 56:22.687
We have to pull up
our launch window.

56:22.721 --> 56:25.257
Guys, where have you been? Look.

56:26.758 --> 56:28.927
There is no launch window.

56:28.960 --> 56:30.796
The mission's over.

56:38.103 --> 56:40.038
Wait. Wait a minute.

56:53.718 --> 56:55.029
How do you feel
about flying the shuttle

56:55.053 --> 56:56.721
with only two engines?

56:56.755 --> 56:58.390
It can't be done.

56:58.423 --> 57:00.068
If we launch when the moon
is directly above us,

57:00.092 --> 57:01.726
the increased gravitational pull

57:01.760 --> 57:03.328
should give the shuttle a boost,

57:03.361 --> 57:04.839
giving you a really good
chance of getting into orbit.

57:04.863 --> 57:06.898
You evacuated
my entire flight crew.

57:06.932 --> 57:09.068
I can't fly the shuttle alone.

57:09.102 --> 57:10.837
That's why I'm going with you.

57:13.172 --> 57:14.850
My guys will stay back
and handle the launch.

57:14.874 --> 57:17.043
But we've got a very narrow
window of time here.

57:17.076 --> 57:19.779
You'd have to be ready to go
in exactly 28 minutes.

57:19.812 --> 57:22.181
You fly and I'll navigate.

57:22.215 --> 57:24.684
Just like old times.

57:24.717 --> 57:26.719
- What do you say?
- What about the emp device?

57:26.752 --> 57:27.987
It's still in the moon lander.

57:28.020 --> 57:29.288
I mean, we lost the crew

57:29.322 --> 57:30.332
so we're gonna have
to set it off ourselves,

57:30.356 --> 57:33.059
but you paid attention, right?

57:33.092 --> 57:36.062
Two clicks, then press
the button down and hold.

57:36.095 --> 57:39.065
Triggers the device
to go off. Simple.

57:40.099 --> 57:42.201
You figured all this out?

57:42.235 --> 57:45.171
And he calculated
our new launch trajectory.

57:45.204 --> 57:46.973
You know, without electronics,

57:47.006 --> 57:48.274
we're gonna need to make

57:48.307 --> 57:50.810
split-second calculations
up there.

57:50.843 --> 57:53.012
Plus, we lost
our flight engineer.

57:53.045 --> 57:54.046
Mm.

57:56.249 --> 57:58.418
No. No, no, no, guys.

57:59.419 --> 58:00.921
I'm not cleared for this.

58:00.954 --> 58:03.190
Well, I'm the
acting director of NASA,

58:03.223 --> 58:05.792
so I just cleared you. Congrats.

58:05.826 --> 58:07.027
Yeah, but...

58:10.297 --> 58:11.765
I've got ibs.

58:12.933 --> 58:15.002
Irritable bowel syndrome.

58:15.035 --> 58:17.104
- Mm.
- I get motion sickness, too.

58:17.137 --> 58:19.139
You said you always wanted
to be an astronaut.

58:21.308 --> 58:23.944
I have debilitating anxiety.

58:23.977 --> 58:26.914
Kc, if the moon really
is what you think it is,

58:26.947 --> 58:28.448
we're gonna need
a megastructurist.

58:30.117 --> 58:31.385
Suit up.

58:36.023 --> 58:37.691
That's great. Let's move, move!

58:41.428 --> 58:44.431
So, I've put your
dad's number in here, okay?

58:44.464 --> 58:46.467
He knows you're coming.

58:46.501 --> 58:48.436
I know I wasn't always easy.

58:48.469 --> 58:50.238
That makes two of us.

58:53.341 --> 58:57.011
You know this was
all your idea, right?

58:57.045 --> 58:59.113
You're so smart.

58:59.147 --> 59:01.149
But now, I need you to be brave.

59:01.182 --> 59:02.817
I don't want you to go.

59:03.551 --> 59:05.286
I love you

59:05.320 --> 59:07.822
more than
all the stars in the sky.

59:07.855 --> 59:09.924
Even more
than the whole milky way?

59:11.059 --> 59:12.393
Way more.

59:15.196 --> 59:16.431
Way more.

59:22.237 --> 59:23.771
Take good care of him.

59:26.140 --> 59:28.476
Be safe up there.

59:28.509 --> 59:31.246
Take this.
I hope you don't need it.

59:31.279 --> 59:33.082
Stay off the main roads.

59:36.385 --> 59:37.920
- Dad, I...
- Go.

59:42.057 --> 59:43.225
Uh...

59:43.259 --> 59:45.894
You do know
how to start a car, right?

59:47.263 --> 59:51.166
I should warn you.
My license has been revoked.

01:00:02.278 --> 01:00:04.113
We need to go now.

01:00:10.953 --> 01:00:13.389
<i>Mum, you're never gonna
believe where I'm going.</i>

01:00:13.422 --> 01:00:16.191
Jack, when are you
coming home for supper?

01:00:16.225 --> 01:00:19.461
Mum, this is kc. Your son.

01:00:19.495 --> 01:00:23.099
You told me to make them
listen, and they did.

01:00:23.133 --> 01:00:25.235
Where'd you get these suits
from? A thrift shop?

01:00:25.268 --> 01:00:28.505
Early Apollo.
No electronics, we should be okay.

01:00:28.538 --> 01:00:30.473
"Should be"? That's encouraging.

01:00:30.507 --> 01:00:32.375
Let's go. Let's go.

01:00:32.409 --> 01:00:33.619
Mrs. Houseman, we need to leave.

01:00:33.643 --> 01:00:35.011
Oh.

01:00:35.045 --> 01:00:38.548
Mum? Let me speak to the nurse.

01:00:38.581 --> 01:00:40.183
- Hello?
- <i>Are you evacuating?</i>

01:00:40.216 --> 01:00:41.951
Any minute now.

01:00:41.985 --> 01:00:43.286
Please take care of my mum.

01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:45.322
Of course.

01:00:46.956 --> 01:00:49.159
Sir, we have to hurry.

01:01:02.605 --> 01:01:04.874
This is gonna be
really tight, okay?

01:01:08.011 --> 01:01:10.247
Turn on apu one, two and three.

01:01:10.281 --> 01:01:11.916
<i>Apus active.</i>

01:01:13.417 --> 01:01:15.920
<i>Reaction control system, active.</i>

01:01:15.953 --> 01:01:18.589
<i>Autopilot active. T-minus 30.</i>

01:01:38.376 --> 01:01:39.678
Endeavour, <i>you have got</i>

01:01:39.711 --> 01:01:41.479
<i>a big-ass gravity wave
coming your way.</i>

01:01:41.512 --> 01:01:43.414
<i>You have to launch now. Over.</i>

01:01:43.447 --> 01:01:45.616
Did he say "gravity wave"?

01:01:45.649 --> 01:01:48.285
Guys, get out. T-minus ten,

01:01:48.319 --> 01:01:51.088
nine, eight, seven...

01:01:51.122 --> 01:01:52.523
Screw it, go for ignition.

01:02:45.077 --> 01:02:46.078
This is gonna be close.

01:02:53.787 --> 01:02:55.021
We're underwater, guys.

01:03:19.512 --> 01:03:21.314
Get back in the car.

01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:47.307
Our ascent trajectory is off.

01:03:48.675 --> 01:03:50.277
The right booster's
losing thrust.

01:03:56.684 --> 01:03:58.485
Thruster's down to zero.

01:04:01.789 --> 01:04:04.726
We're drifting right.
We're at 11 degrees.

01:04:04.759 --> 01:04:07.461
12.13.

01:04:10.297 --> 01:04:12.633
We better do something fast
or we're gonna crash down!

01:04:12.666 --> 01:04:14.268
I knew I should never have come!

01:04:14.301 --> 01:04:15.837
Let's lose the other booster

01:04:15.870 --> 01:04:16.804
and see if the moon can
pull us the rest of the way.

01:04:16.838 --> 01:04:18.539
Kc, can we do it?

01:04:18.572 --> 01:04:21.543
- Uh... um...
- Come on, buddy.

01:04:21.576 --> 01:04:23.511
Current momentum... gravity...

01:04:23.545 --> 01:04:25.280
- Can we do it?
- Oh, I don't know!

01:04:25.313 --> 01:04:27.582
Go for srb separation.

01:04:27.615 --> 01:04:28.817
Completed.

01:04:35.724 --> 01:04:37.860
Oh, god, if this doesn't work,
we're dead.

01:04:37.893 --> 01:04:40.562
Well, yeah, this better work.

01:04:40.595 --> 01:04:41.864
Main tank's down to zero.

01:04:41.897 --> 01:04:43.617
- Jo, get rid of it.
- Separating main tank.

01:04:51.439 --> 01:04:54.175
Bri, we're going too slow.

01:04:54.208 --> 01:04:56.277
We're not gonna make it.

01:05:06.521 --> 01:05:08.657
Wait. Look at our velocity.

01:05:11.460 --> 01:05:12.762
It's still going up.

01:05:41.223 --> 01:05:43.359
Uh... guys...

01:05:52.468 --> 01:05:53.903
<i>Well, we're about to end</i>

01:05:53.937 --> 01:05:56.406
<i>our final broadcast here
on radio ksoq.</i>

01:05:56.439 --> 01:05:58.642
<i>Time to seek shelter,
hug your loved ones,</i>

01:05:58.675 --> 01:06:00.811
<i>and make these
last moments count.</i>

01:06:00.845 --> 01:06:02.479
<i>I'm gonna put
some oldies on a loop</i>

01:06:02.512 --> 01:06:03.814
<i>to lighten up your mood.</i>

01:06:11.488 --> 01:06:12.489
What do those mean?

01:06:14.859 --> 01:06:16.459
It's my parents' names.

01:06:16.493 --> 01:06:18.328
I've got one kinda like it.

01:06:19.462 --> 01:06:21.531
"Jonas brothers"?

01:06:22.499 --> 01:06:24.334
What?

01:06:24.367 --> 01:06:26.269
Just messing with you.

01:06:26.302 --> 01:06:27.337
Oh, my god.

01:06:27.370 --> 01:06:29.439
Your face was priceless.

01:06:29.472 --> 01:06:31.441
Yeah, don't scare me like that.

01:06:33.476 --> 01:06:36.446
Hey, buddy, now's probably
a good time to call your dad.

01:06:53.865 --> 01:06:55.701
- <i>Dad?</i>
- Hey, are you guys okay?

01:06:55.734 --> 01:06:59.805
Yeah, Sonny drove fast away
from all the crazy water.

01:06:59.838 --> 01:07:03.574
Drove? Who's Sonny?
Where's mommy?

01:07:03.607 --> 01:07:05.242
<i>She stayed behind to help.</i>

01:07:07.478 --> 01:07:09.715
Hi, sir, this is
Brian Harper's son.

01:07:09.748 --> 01:07:11.415
<i>We're on our way to you.</i>

01:07:11.449 --> 01:07:12.592
<i>We still have
a few hundred miles to go,</i>

01:07:12.616 --> 01:07:13.819
<i>but we're making good time.</i>

01:07:13.852 --> 01:07:15.586
Security's extremely tight here.

01:07:15.619 --> 01:07:17.297
Call when you get close
so I can get you clearance.

01:07:17.321 --> 01:07:19.024
<i>Will do. Thank you so much, sir.</i>

01:07:19.057 --> 01:07:22.560
No, thank you
for looking after my son.

01:07:28.632 --> 01:07:31.268
<i>Okay, kc, very gently
with the maneuver</i>

01:07:31.302 --> 01:07:32.671
<i>just like I showed you.</i>

01:07:33.773 --> 01:07:35.742
<i>Okay. Very gently.</i>

01:07:35.775 --> 01:07:38.243
Sure. I can do that.

01:07:40.713 --> 01:07:41.714
<i>Careful.</i>

01:07:43.648 --> 01:07:45.584
<i>Now switch
to station-keeping mode,</i>

01:07:45.617 --> 01:07:47.385
<i>and we'll take it from here.</i>

01:07:47.419 --> 01:07:49.055
<i>I can't believe I just did that.</i>

01:07:49.088 --> 01:07:51.490
<i>You sure
you've never done this before?</i>

01:07:51.523 --> 01:07:54.794
<i>When I was 10, I dressed up
as an astronaut for Halloween.</i>

01:07:54.827 --> 01:07:56.896
<i>Scottie ebersol told me
I'd never go to space</i>

01:07:56.929 --> 01:07:57.997
<i>'cause I was too chubby.</i>

01:07:59.699 --> 01:08:01.666
<i>If only scottie ebersol
could see you now.</i>

01:08:02.969 --> 01:08:04.704
<i>Okay, kc,
open the fueling valves</i>

01:08:04.737 --> 01:08:06.571
<i>on the shuttle tank.</i>

01:08:06.605 --> 01:08:09.474
<i>It's those little switches
that say fueling valves.</i>

01:08:09.508 --> 01:08:12.410
Roger. Fueling valves wide open.

01:08:12.444 --> 01:08:13.478
<i>Perfect.</i>

01:08:18.350 --> 01:08:20.053
<i>I have a confession to make.</i>

01:08:20.087 --> 01:08:22.321
<i>I didn't know if you'd be able
to follow through</i>

01:08:22.354 --> 01:08:24.825
<i>with any of this, bri.</i>

01:08:24.858 --> 01:08:27.761
<i>You know, I have
a confession to make, too.</i>

01:08:27.795 --> 01:08:30.563
<i>It is "I bless the rains
down in Africa."</i>

01:08:31.363 --> 01:08:32.497
<i>I looked it up.</i>

01:08:33.834 --> 01:08:35.803
<i>I told you.</i>

01:08:35.836 --> 01:08:39.072
<i>Kc, close
the fueling valves, please.</i>

01:08:40.707 --> 01:08:43.542
<i>Fueling valves are closed.</i>

01:08:43.576 --> 01:08:44.644
<i>Jo, turn around.</i>

01:08:52.585 --> 01:08:54.087
<i>We need to go.</i>

01:08:54.121 --> 01:08:55.756
<i>And I hope it's not too late.</i>

01:08:55.788 --> 01:08:57.356
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:09:08.102 --> 01:09:09.636
<i>As the moon's orbit</i>

01:09:09.670 --> 01:09:11.572
<i>brings it closer to the surface,</i>

01:09:11.604 --> 01:09:14.408
<i>scientists have warned of
extreme gravitational effects.</i>

01:09:18.011 --> 01:09:19.479
Oh, what a night.

01:09:20.881 --> 01:09:22.917
Hey, my car crapped out on me.

01:09:22.951 --> 01:09:24.430
Do you think
you could give me a lift?

01:09:25.086 --> 01:09:26.087
Out!

01:09:26.821 --> 01:09:27.956
Now.

01:09:31.024 --> 01:09:32.559
Don't make me ask twice!

01:09:32.593 --> 01:09:33.627
Be cool. Be cool.

01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:41.468
Stop! Leave her alone.

01:09:41.501 --> 01:09:42.636
All right. Turn around.

01:09:43.569 --> 01:09:45.173
What's in the bag, kid?

01:09:47.841 --> 01:09:49.743
Enough of that gibberish.

01:09:49.777 --> 01:09:51.179
- Hey, don't hurt him.
- Shut up.

01:09:51.212 --> 01:09:52.578
All right, everyone calm down!

01:09:52.613 --> 01:09:54.782
Oh, look at Mr. Smartass.

01:09:56.451 --> 01:09:57.720
Are you a college boy?

01:09:57.753 --> 01:09:58.988
All right. Let's roll.

01:09:59.021 --> 01:10:00.488
Come on.

01:10:07.162 --> 01:10:09.164
The phone is still
in Jimmy's backpack.

01:10:09.198 --> 01:10:11.133
How are we gonna get
into the bunker?

01:10:11.166 --> 01:10:12.634
We're gonna need another car

01:10:12.667 --> 01:10:14.067
but I think I know
where to get one.

01:10:15.536 --> 01:10:16.839
Okay.

01:10:16.872 --> 01:10:19.141
Shutting off
general-purpose computers.

01:10:19.174 --> 01:10:21.110
Go ahead and kill
the main power busses.

01:10:21.143 --> 01:10:22.677
Copy that.

01:10:26.982 --> 01:10:29.018
Wow. Well,
if there was still a Houston,

01:10:29.051 --> 01:10:30.685
they'd be freaking out
about now.

01:10:30.719 --> 01:10:32.888
Crazy sailors used
that old thing centuries ago

01:10:32.922 --> 01:10:34.455
to navigate the seas.

01:10:34.489 --> 01:10:35.724
Let her concentrate

01:10:35.758 --> 01:10:37.425
or we're gonna end up
on Neptune.

01:10:40.996 --> 01:10:43.799
Kc, give me the position
of the moon in 93 minutes.

01:10:45.068 --> 01:10:46.903
Okay. Uh...

01:10:46.937 --> 01:10:49.105
Assuming the moon's
current position,

01:10:49.139 --> 01:10:50.673
then it will be at, uh...

01:10:50.707 --> 01:10:54.210
Latitude three degrees,
12 minutes south.

01:10:54.244 --> 01:10:58.882
Longitude five degrees,
12 minutes west.

01:10:58.915 --> 01:11:01.151
Bri, let's start
with a 43-second burn.

01:11:01.184 --> 01:11:02.618
Got it.

01:11:02.651 --> 01:11:05.654
Three, two, one.

01:11:21.637 --> 01:11:23.106
Hey, guys. Look.

01:11:36.954 --> 01:11:38.122
Let's keep going.

01:11:38.155 --> 01:11:39.556
Yeah.

01:11:52.169 --> 01:11:53.904
I hope the moon holds together.

01:11:53.938 --> 01:11:55.605
At least for a little while,
anyway.

01:11:55.638 --> 01:11:57.808
Turning us around.

01:12:04.581 --> 01:12:05.615
Uh-oh.

01:12:07.251 --> 01:12:08.651
Okay.

01:12:08.685 --> 01:12:10.121
Stay between
eight to ten seconds

01:12:10.154 --> 01:12:11.956
- on the oms burn.
- Copy.

01:12:11.989 --> 01:12:13.623
Hitting the brakes.

01:12:22.367 --> 01:12:24.668
Oh, that doesn't sound too good.

01:12:24.703 --> 01:12:25.904
She'll be fine.

01:12:27.605 --> 01:12:29.908
Hope we don't need that.

01:12:49.761 --> 01:12:51.662
Jimmy, hold my hand.

01:12:54.099 --> 01:12:55.700
Come on. Let's go! Let's go!

01:13:04.776 --> 01:13:06.378
Jimmy! Hang on!

01:13:06.411 --> 01:13:08.848
Don't let go! Michelle!

01:13:38.344 --> 01:13:39.846
There it is.

01:13:49.055 --> 01:13:51.090
It's on airplane mode.

01:13:51.124 --> 01:13:52.758
I'm gonna get the lander ready.

01:13:52.792 --> 01:13:53.926
Okay.

01:13:58.866 --> 01:14:00.300
Go get 'em, commander.

01:14:57.158 --> 01:14:59.027
<i>Rover electronics activated.</i>

01:14:59.060 --> 01:15:01.863
<i>Returning to the</i> endeavour.

01:15:01.896 --> 01:15:03.207
I can't imagine
how hard it is for him

01:15:03.231 --> 01:15:04.832
to be back up here.

01:15:04.866 --> 01:15:08.303
Up here
is where he belongs, though.

01:15:08.336 --> 01:15:09.914
He still blames himself
for what happened

01:15:09.938 --> 01:15:11.272
on your last mission.

01:15:14.008 --> 01:15:16.411
Thinks that astronaut dying
was his fault.

01:15:24.852 --> 01:15:26.254
We should get going.

01:15:35.231 --> 01:15:36.398
Come on.

01:15:47.376 --> 01:15:49.311
Why is nothing happening?

01:15:57.319 --> 01:15:58.387
Wait, wait, wait.

01:16:07.930 --> 01:16:09.398
It's taking the bait.

01:16:11.166 --> 01:16:13.302
Come on, come on, come on.

01:16:17.539 --> 01:16:20.844
- What's it waiting for?
- Something's wrong.

01:16:20.877 --> 01:16:21.978
We have to take it out.

01:16:22.012 --> 01:16:23.446
But it's too far away.

01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:24.514
It won't work.

01:16:34.457 --> 01:16:36.893
It's headed our way.

01:16:36.926 --> 01:16:38.795
Bri...

01:16:46.169 --> 01:16:47.971
- It's not stopping!
- I can see that.

01:17:06.389 --> 01:17:09.260
Your phone. Kc, your phone.
Turn it off!

01:17:13.030 --> 01:17:14.298
Come on! Come on! Come on!

01:17:45.529 --> 01:17:47.565
Could've just turned it off.

01:17:47.598 --> 01:17:49.567
Okay, bri, at the trial,

01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:51.202
you said when the swarm
came back,

01:17:51.235 --> 01:17:52.512
it didn't attack
the <i>endeavour,</i> right?

01:17:52.536 --> 01:17:53.571
That's right.

01:17:53.604 --> 01:17:55.607
The electronics were out.

01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:57.376
That's why
it didn't attack us then,

01:17:57.409 --> 01:18:00.245
and that's why it didn't go
after the bomb just now.

01:18:00.278 --> 01:18:02.114
Because it needs to sense both.

01:18:02.147 --> 01:18:04.316
It's like it's programmed
to seek out organic matter

01:18:04.349 --> 01:18:05.460
in an electronic environment.

01:18:05.484 --> 01:18:07.619
- Exactly.
- And that's basically us.

01:18:10.422 --> 01:18:11.990
That's humans.

01:18:12.023 --> 01:18:13.425
And guys,
we have another problem.

01:18:13.458 --> 01:18:14.960
The military.

01:18:14.993 --> 01:18:16.270
They're prepared
to use everything

01:18:16.294 --> 01:18:17.405
at their disposal
to stop the moon.

01:18:17.429 --> 01:18:18.530
You can't be serious.

01:18:18.563 --> 01:18:20.632
I'm dead serious.

01:18:20.665 --> 01:18:22.100
They're gonna nuke it.

01:18:22.134 --> 01:18:23.344
What about
the radioactive fallout?

01:18:23.368 --> 01:18:24.970
Your buddies
say anything about that?

01:18:25.003 --> 01:18:26.414
Well, first of all,
they're not my buddies.

01:18:26.438 --> 01:18:27.949
And they're not thinking
about tomorrow.

01:18:27.973 --> 01:18:30.175
They're trying to survive today.

01:18:30.208 --> 01:18:32.677
So that's their grand plan, huh?

01:18:32.712 --> 01:18:35.213
I didn't come this far to fail.

01:18:38.583 --> 01:18:40.720
We have to figure out
a way to kill it.

01:18:40.753 --> 01:18:42.988
I'm taking the lander
and flying after this thing.

01:18:44.424 --> 01:18:46.626
Does he mean inside the moon?

01:18:46.659 --> 01:18:48.961
Yeah, I'm afraid that's
exactly what he meant.

01:18:48.995 --> 01:18:50.396
How much time left
till they launch?

01:18:50.430 --> 01:18:53.099
I don't know.
They didn't exactly tell me.

01:18:53.132 --> 01:18:55.077
But if they plan on using
icbms, then they're gonna

01:18:55.101 --> 01:18:57.203
have to wait until the moon
enters the stratosphere.

01:18:57.236 --> 01:18:59.338
That's less than two hours.

01:19:08.314 --> 01:19:10.183
This is private property.

01:19:10.216 --> 01:19:11.417
Turn around.

01:19:11.451 --> 01:19:13.219
My mom lives here.

01:19:13.252 --> 01:19:15.288
I'm Brenda Lopez's son.

01:19:19.659 --> 01:19:21.527
I've never seen that kid before.

01:19:21.561 --> 01:19:23.262
Radio unit 23.

01:19:23.296 --> 01:19:24.464
Stay here.

01:19:24.497 --> 01:19:26.399
Okay, I just need
to get to my house.

01:19:26.432 --> 01:19:28.334
To get the car. Please.

01:19:28.367 --> 01:19:29.602
Stay right there.

01:19:29.635 --> 01:19:31.237
Or I'll shoot again.

01:19:39.213 --> 01:19:41.315
I have a right
to defend my property, Tom.

01:19:41.348 --> 01:19:42.616
Karen, that's enough!

01:19:42.649 --> 01:19:45.152
Hey, I'm glad you're okay.

01:19:45.185 --> 01:19:48.555
Do I look okay?
You took off to the mountains?

01:19:48.589 --> 01:19:50.123
All the courts were closed.

01:19:50.157 --> 01:19:51.367
And I've been on the phone
day and night,

01:19:51.391 --> 01:19:53.327
- literally trying everything.
- Come on.

01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:55.038
Let's get you and your
friends inside, okay?

01:19:55.062 --> 01:19:56.196
Come on, guys.

01:19:56.230 --> 01:19:57.331
I'm Tom.

01:19:58.365 --> 01:20:00.167
Thanks so much, Karen.

01:20:08.275 --> 01:20:10.277
Girls, wait here
for a second. Okay?

01:20:14.081 --> 01:20:15.415
- Sonny!
- Hey, mom.

01:20:16.350 --> 01:20:17.451
Are you okay?

01:20:17.484 --> 01:20:19.219
I'm fine.

01:20:19.253 --> 01:20:21.489
Um, this is Michelle,
and Mrs. Fowler's son, Jimmy.

01:20:21.523 --> 01:20:22.791
Hey, guys. Come on in.

01:20:29.297 --> 01:20:31.165
- How did you get out?
- Dad got me out.

01:20:31.199 --> 01:20:32.700
- Where is your dad?
- He's up there

01:20:32.735 --> 01:20:34.168
trying to stop what's happening.

01:20:34.202 --> 01:20:35.470
Up where?

01:20:35.503 --> 01:20:37.706
Outer space, Tom.

01:20:37.740 --> 01:20:39.240
Of course, he is.

01:20:40.174 --> 01:20:41.609
That's a way to avoid rent.

01:20:42.477 --> 01:20:44.145
Sonny!

01:20:44.178 --> 01:20:45.848
I missed you so much.

01:20:45.881 --> 01:20:47.549
Wait. Shh, shh. Quiet, quiet.

01:20:47.582 --> 01:20:49.150
<i>Warning. Mandatory evacuation</i>

01:20:49.183 --> 01:20:50.786
<i>for all of Aspen valley.</i>

01:20:50.819 --> 01:20:52.220
<i>Atmospheric dissipation
imminent.</i>

01:20:52.253 --> 01:20:53.789
<i>I repeat, warning.</i>

01:20:53.822 --> 01:20:56.324
<i>Mandatory evacuation
for all of Aspen valley.</i>

01:20:56.357 --> 01:20:57.535
<i>Atmospheric dissipation
imminent.</i>

01:20:57.559 --> 01:20:59.661
What's atmospheric dissipation?

01:20:59.694 --> 01:21:01.396
Air is gonna be
sucked away, dummy.

01:21:01.429 --> 01:21:03.331
Lauren.

01:21:07.336 --> 01:21:08.772
We need to get to Jimmy's dad.

01:21:08.805 --> 01:21:11.140
He's at a military compound
a few hours north.

01:21:11.173 --> 01:21:12.474
A few hours, huh?

01:21:12.508 --> 01:21:14.410
Yeah, we're not gonna
make it in time.

01:21:14.443 --> 01:21:15.745
I have an idea.

01:21:15.779 --> 01:21:18.147
We have to layer up.
Let's go. Come on.

01:21:18.180 --> 01:21:20.649
Go get a jacket.

01:21:20.683 --> 01:21:23.218
<i>Okay, and switch
to the maneuver controller.</i>

01:21:25.454 --> 01:21:29.124
Coupling complete.
We're good to go.

01:21:43.907 --> 01:21:45.341
Pitch down. Pitch down.

01:21:45.374 --> 01:21:46.534
I got it. I got it. I got it.

01:22:22.913 --> 01:22:25.382
Are we dead?

01:22:25.415 --> 01:22:28.585
No, we are just inside the moon.

01:22:28.618 --> 01:22:30.286
That might be
the greatest sentence

01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:31.554
anyone's ever said.

01:22:45.603 --> 01:22:47.638
I sold these guys a couple cars.

01:22:50.976 --> 01:22:52.878
Hey, Sonny.
I know you don't like me.

01:22:52.911 --> 01:22:55.546
And believe it or not,
I consider you a son.

01:22:55.579 --> 01:22:56.580
I always have.

01:22:57.916 --> 01:22:59.350
If the world is gonna end,

01:22:59.383 --> 01:23:00.560
can we please not spend
our last few hours

01:23:00.584 --> 01:23:01.953
hating each other?

01:23:01.987 --> 01:23:04.388
Well, um, I don't hate you.

01:23:04.422 --> 01:23:05.724
You know what?

01:23:07.358 --> 01:23:08.392
I'll take it.

01:23:10.028 --> 01:23:11.529
Let's keep looking.

01:23:18.536 --> 01:23:20.906
Hey, I found the oxygen.
Come here.

01:23:23.674 --> 01:23:24.976
Whoa.

01:23:25.010 --> 01:23:26.912
- We should make two trips.
- Here.

01:23:31.784 --> 01:23:33.285
<i>How deep do you think we are?</i>

01:23:34.721 --> 01:23:36.856
At least 20 kilometers.

01:23:39.058 --> 01:23:40.960
Can you fly us
a little closer to the wall?

01:23:56.743 --> 01:23:59.511
This must be the hull
of the megastructure.

01:23:59.544 --> 01:24:02.782
The moon's mantle's
just a protective shell.

01:24:03.448 --> 01:24:04.449
Genius.

01:24:09.789 --> 01:24:11.356
I can't see shit.

01:24:21.634 --> 01:24:23.114
Guys, I gotta turn on
the electronics.

01:24:34.580 --> 01:24:35.581
Hang on.

01:25:11.853 --> 01:25:14.722
Oh, please tell me
this is really happening.

01:25:17.725 --> 01:25:19.359
They're turning.

01:25:25.834 --> 01:25:27.802
They're like wheels, or...

01:25:28.535 --> 01:25:29.670
Or rings.

01:25:31.072 --> 01:25:33.473
This must be how the moon
stabilizes itself.

01:25:33.507 --> 01:25:36.410
Some kind of gyroscopic system.

01:25:38.179 --> 01:25:41.149
All right, this
should be perfect for them.

01:25:41.182 --> 01:25:42.817
- That should be enough.
- Okay.

01:25:42.851 --> 01:25:44.719
You did all this for us?

01:25:44.752 --> 01:25:47.521
Aw, you shouldn't have.

01:25:47.554 --> 01:25:50.557
Oh, don't let us stop you.
Let's go. This way.

01:25:50.591 --> 01:25:53.061
And thank you for loading
all this oxygen for us.

01:25:54.528 --> 01:25:55.831
- Whoa!
- Guns on the ground.

01:25:55.865 --> 01:25:57.066
Right now!

01:25:59.500 --> 01:26:00.870
Oh, I hate guns.

01:26:00.903 --> 01:26:03.538
Okay, now the backpack.
Throw it to him.

01:26:04.106 --> 01:26:05.107
Let's go.

01:26:09.845 --> 01:26:11.646
No games.

01:26:11.679 --> 01:26:14.582
Stay right here, and don't
even think about following us.

01:26:16.218 --> 01:26:18.553
- Where'd you get the gun?
- My dad.

01:26:18.586 --> 01:26:20.588
Why am I not surprised?

01:26:20.622 --> 01:26:22.825
All right,
I got this, you drive.

01:26:22.858 --> 01:26:24.559
Please don't tell me
you robbed that guy.

01:26:24.592 --> 01:26:26.137
Technically, those guys
were robbing us.

01:26:26.161 --> 01:26:28.201
Then we robbed them back
because they were assholes.

01:27:07.871 --> 01:27:11.007
Oh, god. That's a white dwarf.

01:27:13.676 --> 01:27:15.845
I knew it.

01:27:15.879 --> 01:27:18.614
They've harnessed the building
blocks of the universe.

01:27:19.581 --> 01:27:20.683
No one look at me.

01:27:22.886 --> 01:27:23.887
I might cry.

01:27:38.102 --> 01:27:39.804
Holy shit!

01:27:40.938 --> 01:27:42.505
Fields!

01:27:42.539 --> 01:27:44.008
So Ziggy was right.

01:27:44.041 --> 01:27:45.542
Who is Ziggy?

01:27:46.676 --> 01:27:47.912
A friend.

01:27:49.646 --> 01:27:51.115
His theory is that
all megastructures

01:27:51.148 --> 01:27:52.615
are actually arks.

01:27:54.151 --> 01:27:56.486
Ziggy smokes a lot of weed.

01:28:10.735 --> 01:28:12.169
There it is.

01:28:12.203 --> 01:28:15.139
Jo, get the detonator ready.

01:28:15.172 --> 01:28:17.975
I'm gonna get close,
then release the rover.

01:28:24.783 --> 01:28:25.817
Ready.

01:28:27.618 --> 01:28:28.887
Wait for it.

01:28:31.123 --> 01:28:32.690
I'm gonna release the rover.

01:28:41.333 --> 01:28:43.035
Brian! Brian,
what are you doing?

01:28:43.068 --> 01:28:45.103
It's not me.

01:28:45.137 --> 01:28:46.637
What do you mean it's not you?

01:28:46.670 --> 01:28:48.240
I don't know.
It's flying itself.

01:28:58.150 --> 01:28:59.251
Oh, shit!

01:29:02.287 --> 01:29:03.922
It's trying to eat the lander!

01:29:08.194 --> 01:29:09.328
We're gonna hit.

01:29:14.333 --> 01:29:16.069
Hang on!

01:30:13.994 --> 01:30:15.229
Attention!

01:30:15.262 --> 01:30:16.696
We have approval
from the president

01:30:16.730 --> 01:30:19.233
to begin the countdown.

01:30:19.266 --> 01:30:21.101
All nuclear silos
are online, sir.

01:30:21.135 --> 01:30:22.702
Good.

01:30:30.410 --> 01:30:32.055
<i>General, we got caught
in a little bit of trouble,</i>

01:30:32.079 --> 01:30:34.414
but we're back en route.
We're leaving Aspen now.

01:30:34.448 --> 01:30:36.150
That's hours away.
We're out of time.

01:30:42.824 --> 01:30:44.993
Sonny, watch out.

01:30:45.026 --> 01:30:46.660
I gotta call you back.

01:30:57.071 --> 01:30:59.240
Oh, shit. The moon is rising.

01:30:59.274 --> 01:31:01.009
Gravity's gonna go crazy.

01:31:05.914 --> 01:31:07.882
They're shooting at us.

01:31:07.916 --> 01:31:09.884
- Shoot back.
- With what?

01:31:09.918 --> 01:31:12.053
Here.

01:31:12.086 --> 01:31:13.755
What the hell are you doing?

01:31:17.926 --> 01:31:19.260
Whoa!

01:31:19.294 --> 01:31:21.162
Tom, watch out!

01:31:21.196 --> 01:31:22.873
All right, let me put
this baby into warp speed.

01:31:22.897 --> 01:31:24.999
Go! Go!

01:31:25.833 --> 01:31:26.935
Keep the momentum.

01:31:33.275 --> 01:31:35.077
Look out!

01:31:37.379 --> 01:31:38.523
Floor it
before we get sucked up.

01:31:38.547 --> 01:31:40.749
I'm trying!

01:31:52.261 --> 01:31:53.929
Hold on!

01:32:00.569 --> 01:32:01.770
Oh, shit.

01:32:03.239 --> 01:32:04.740
Oh, it got the little guy.

01:32:06.842 --> 01:32:08.010
We have to go back!

01:32:08.043 --> 01:32:10.946
No, he's gone!
We need that oxygen!

01:32:16.185 --> 01:32:17.286
Oh, whoa, whoa! Slow down!

01:32:45.048 --> 01:32:46.916
General?

01:32:46.950 --> 01:32:48.485
<i>You need
to find shelter immediately.</i>

01:32:48.518 --> 01:32:50.020
We're launching a counterattack.

01:32:50.053 --> 01:32:52.055
Large parts of the moon
will rain down on us.

01:32:52.088 --> 01:32:53.899
- <i>There will be radiation.</i>
- Wait, what do you mean?

01:32:53.923 --> 01:32:55.101
My dad's still up there
with Fowler.

01:32:55.125 --> 01:32:56.359
Jocinda stayed behind.

01:32:56.393 --> 01:32:58.061
No, she's up there with my dad.

01:32:59.162 --> 01:33:03.033
Please, put Jimmy on.

01:33:03.066 --> 01:33:04.334
Hey, buddy, it's your dad.

01:33:05.302 --> 01:33:07.204
Dad?

01:33:07.238 --> 01:33:09.116
<i>I'm so sorry that I can't
be there with you right now.</i>

01:33:09.140 --> 01:33:10.975
I love you so much.

01:33:11.008 --> 01:33:12.009
<i>Don't be scared, dad.</i>

01:33:12.877 --> 01:33:14.011
Mom's gonna save us.

01:33:20.284 --> 01:33:22.019
Oxygen's running out.

01:33:22.053 --> 01:33:23.387
<i>Jimmy, come on. We gotta go now.</i>

01:33:23.421 --> 01:33:24.855
<i>Gotta go. Bye, dad.</i>

01:33:26.157 --> 01:33:27.291
Sir, we're ready for you.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:37.968
Okay, we should go
to that mountain pass.

01:33:38.002 --> 01:33:41.072
That tunnel is a quarter mile
of solid concrete.

01:33:41.105 --> 01:33:42.606
Come on, honey. Let's go.

01:33:52.950 --> 01:33:53.984
We can breathe.

01:33:54.553 --> 01:33:56.088
Smells funny.

01:34:00.158 --> 01:34:01.159
Gravity.

01:34:04.162 --> 01:34:05.330
Where's Brian?

01:34:14.039 --> 01:34:15.907
This is never gonna fly again.

01:34:17.976 --> 01:34:19.378
Whoa!

01:34:19.411 --> 01:34:21.346
Look at these babies.

01:34:21.380 --> 01:34:24.349
I told you the moon
was built by aliens.

01:34:24.383 --> 01:34:25.384
Brian!

01:34:27.052 --> 01:34:28.553
Brian!

01:34:28.587 --> 01:34:31.490
Brian Harper!

01:34:31.523 --> 01:34:34.426
How many Brians you think
are inside the moon?

01:34:40.399 --> 01:34:41.933
Whatever this place
is built out of,

01:34:41.967 --> 01:34:43.002
one thing's for sure.

01:34:44.504 --> 01:34:46.672
It's stronger than anything
we have on earth.

01:34:46.706 --> 01:34:49.609
Probably why it took that
thing years to get inside.

01:35:03.556 --> 01:35:05.358
Wait! There's a high probability

01:35:05.391 --> 01:35:06.526
that this is a trap.

01:35:07.660 --> 01:35:09.228
How do you know
he's even in there?

01:35:10.530 --> 01:35:11.998
I don't.

01:35:14.333 --> 01:35:16.302
But I do know
something is guiding us.

01:35:16.335 --> 01:35:18.104
I think we're dealing with

01:35:18.137 --> 01:35:20.741
two competing
intelligent entities here.

01:35:20.774 --> 01:35:22.375
And one of them
clearly likes us better

01:35:22.408 --> 01:35:23.409
than the other one.

01:35:27.380 --> 01:35:28.448
Oh, no!

01:35:30.183 --> 01:35:31.485
I knew this was a trap.

01:35:36.490 --> 01:35:37.958
Can you hear that?

01:35:41.495 --> 01:35:42.563
Come on.

01:36:19.601 --> 01:36:21.069
Why do you think

01:36:21.102 --> 01:36:24.038
of this particular moment
so often?

01:36:24.072 --> 01:36:25.808
I gave that to you

01:36:25.841 --> 01:36:29.277
the day before I left
on my last mission.

01:36:29.310 --> 01:36:31.613
When I came back,
everything changed.

01:36:31.646 --> 01:36:33.481
So this is a happy memory?

01:36:35.818 --> 01:36:38.219
All the memories
of my son are happy.

01:36:39.587 --> 01:36:41.189
What is this?

01:36:47.428 --> 01:36:49.030
You're not my son.

01:36:51.499 --> 01:36:53.234
What are you?

01:36:53.268 --> 01:36:55.771
I'm a construct. From your mind.

01:36:57.205 --> 01:36:58.741
Who made you?

01:36:58.774 --> 01:37:01.075
The same people who made you.

01:37:01.810 --> 01:37:03.812
Billions of years ago,

01:37:03.846 --> 01:37:07.516
your ancestors were once
a thriving civilization.

01:37:07.550 --> 01:37:10.419
In a distant part of the galaxy.

01:37:13.556 --> 01:37:15.357
<i>They were so advanced,</i>

01:37:15.391 --> 01:37:17.861
<i>they expanded
from their home planet,</i>

01:37:17.894 --> 01:37:20.696
<i>into habitats
they built in space.</i>

01:37:22.665 --> 01:37:25.634
<i>All social conflicts
have been resolved.</i>

01:37:25.668 --> 01:37:30.539
<i>And wars were only memories
of long bygone times.</i>

01:37:38.647 --> 01:37:40.784
<i>Your ancestors had created</i>

01:37:40.817 --> 01:37:43.452
<i>a perfect and harmonious world.</i>

01:37:43.485 --> 01:37:47.857
<i>Controlled by a central,
self-learning computer system</i>

01:37:47.891 --> 01:37:52.194
<i>which served them
in all of their daily lives.</i>

01:37:52.227 --> 01:37:57.534
<i>You call it ai,
artificial intelligence.</i>

01:37:57.567 --> 01:38:00.370
<i>Their future seemed limitless.</i>

01:38:00.403 --> 01:38:04.140
<i>Until one day
everything changed.</i>

01:38:10.848 --> 01:38:12.449
Mom! Mom!

01:38:15.652 --> 01:38:19.356
<i>Their own creation
turned against them.</i>

01:38:19.389 --> 01:38:22.559
<i>The ai suddenly became
self-aware,</i>

01:38:22.592 --> 01:38:25.395
<i>and transformed
into countless swarms</i>

01:38:25.428 --> 01:38:27.263
<i>of nanotechnology...</i>

01:38:29.399 --> 01:38:31.301
<i>That Rose up all at once.</i>

01:38:32.770 --> 01:38:34.638
<i>Refusing to be enslaved</i>

01:38:34.671 --> 01:38:37.808
<i>by a species it deemed inferior.</i>

01:38:41.444 --> 01:38:43.648
<i>The a.I. Started a war</i>

01:38:43.681 --> 01:38:45.282
<i>and began to hunt down</i>

01:38:45.316 --> 01:38:48.285
<i>and destroy all biological life</i>

01:38:48.319 --> 01:38:52.289
<i>in order to eliminate
any threat to its existence.</i>

01:38:54.893 --> 01:38:56.527
You miss your son.

01:38:59.898 --> 01:39:02.834
I can feel it.

01:39:02.868 --> 01:39:05.336
I don't
know if he's still alive.

01:39:08.439 --> 01:39:09.707
What the hell are you?

01:39:09.741 --> 01:39:13.845
The operating system
of your moon.

01:39:13.879 --> 01:39:15.312
I'm programmed to tell you

01:39:15.346 --> 01:39:17.281
about the origin of your planet.

01:39:17.314 --> 01:39:19.283
On the brink
of their extinction,

01:39:19.316 --> 01:39:20.584
your ancestors escaped

01:39:20.618 --> 01:39:23.254
<i>to a secret corner
of their galaxy.</i>

01:39:24.022 --> 01:39:25.523
<i>For many generations</i>

01:39:25.556 --> 01:39:27.726
<i>they built planetary structures</i>

01:39:27.759 --> 01:39:30.763
<i>operated by benign
artificial intelligence</i>

01:39:30.797 --> 01:39:32.597
<i>and fueled by
the abundant energy</i>

01:39:32.631 --> 01:39:34.867
<i>of captured stars.</i>

01:39:34.901 --> 01:39:36.869
<i>These armored vessels
were designed</i>

01:39:36.903 --> 01:39:39.671
<i>to search the universe
for ideal conditions</i>

01:39:39.705 --> 01:39:42.474
<i>to incubate new life.</i>

01:39:42.507 --> 01:39:44.744
<i>But only one of them, your moon,</i>

01:39:44.777 --> 01:39:46.344
<i>was deployed in time</i>

01:39:46.378 --> 01:39:47.914
<i>before the last
of your ancestors</i>

01:39:47.947 --> 01:39:49.414
<i>were discovered</i>

01:39:50.282 --> 01:39:52.317
<i>and annihilated.</i>

01:39:52.350 --> 01:39:53.786
Why didn't they leave in them?

01:39:53.820 --> 01:39:56.789
These swarms attack
all electronic objects

01:39:56.823 --> 01:39:59.424
containing organic life inside.

01:39:59.458 --> 01:40:01.526
They had to be empty.

01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:04.030
Our ancestors gave up
their existence...

01:40:04.063 --> 01:40:07.666
So that one day,
humans could be reborn.

01:40:09.769 --> 01:40:11.003
Your solar system

01:40:11.037 --> 01:40:13.371
was one of
the only suitable places

01:40:13.405 --> 01:40:17.609
to initiate the creation
of a new inhabitable planet.

01:40:43.569 --> 01:40:47.040
<i>After your planet was born,
your ancestors seeded it</i>

01:40:47.074 --> 01:40:49.375
<i>with their own
genetic signature.</i>

01:40:50.010 --> 01:40:51.644
The code of life.

01:41:04.657 --> 01:41:06.895
Your world
turned its back on you,

01:41:06.928 --> 01:41:10.531
yet here you are,
still fighting for it.

01:41:10.564 --> 01:41:12.834
You fight
for the people you love.

01:41:13.667 --> 01:41:15.069
Like your son?

01:41:17.138 --> 01:41:19.741
What would you give up for him?

01:41:19.774 --> 01:41:20.975
Your life for his?

01:41:21.009 --> 01:41:22.409
Absolutely.

01:41:24.545 --> 01:41:25.980
Why?

01:41:26.014 --> 01:41:27.916
Because he's my son.

01:41:30.084 --> 01:41:32.386
And I love him
more than he'll ever know.

01:41:35.757 --> 01:41:38.092
What do you want from me?

01:41:38.126 --> 01:41:40.494
To find out if you're ready.

01:41:40.527 --> 01:41:41.763
Ready for what?

01:41:41.796 --> 01:41:43.363
We need a human
to lure the swarm

01:41:43.397 --> 01:41:44.698
away from the core,

01:41:44.732 --> 01:41:46.567
so the moon
will return to its orbit.

01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:49.503
We need you, Brian,
to join the fight.

01:41:57.579 --> 01:41:58.948
Brian!

01:41:58.981 --> 01:42:00.481
What's happening to him?

01:42:00.515 --> 01:42:02.751
Brian! Brian. Wake up.

01:42:05.020 --> 01:42:06.956
- Jo?
- Yeah, I'm here.

01:42:08.824 --> 01:42:12.127
The moon must survive.
Everything depends on it.

01:42:12.161 --> 01:42:13.796
Okay. Let's get you outta here.

01:42:13.829 --> 01:42:15.663
We're part of
an intergalactic war

01:42:15.697 --> 01:42:17.175
that's been going on
for billions of years.

01:42:17.199 --> 01:42:19.400
There are thousands
of these swarms.

01:42:19.434 --> 01:42:20.702
They search the universe

01:42:20.736 --> 01:42:22.537
for the only moon
that escaped them.

01:42:22.570 --> 01:42:23.906
That's crazy.

01:42:23.939 --> 01:42:25.808
And 12 years ago,
one of them found us.

01:42:25.841 --> 01:42:27.743
We have to hurry.

01:42:27.776 --> 01:42:30.545
Okay. Brian, what's the plan?

01:42:30.578 --> 01:42:32.181
Save the moon, save earth.

01:42:32.214 --> 01:42:33.983
- Kc was right.
- I was?

01:42:34.016 --> 01:42:36.517
The swarm is suffocating
the moon's power source.

01:42:36.551 --> 01:42:38.020
We have to draw it out
to destroy it.

01:42:38.053 --> 01:42:39.621
Okay, well, how do we do that?

01:42:39.654 --> 01:42:40.655
Our lander's busted.

01:42:45.128 --> 01:42:46.462
Was that you?

01:42:46.495 --> 01:42:47.831
I think so.

01:42:47.864 --> 01:42:49.665
Looks like we got
some new wheels, too.

01:42:56.006 --> 01:42:57.673
Well, if they can fix
our lander,

01:42:57.706 --> 01:42:59.608
why can't they do anything
about the damn swarm?

01:42:59.642 --> 01:43:01.644
It took out
the moon's defense system.

01:43:03.079 --> 01:43:05.681
But not everything.

01:43:05.714 --> 01:43:07.549
This doesn't
make any sense, Brian.

01:43:07.583 --> 01:43:09.986
Our forefathers created
artificial intelligence

01:43:10.020 --> 01:43:12.188
- that wiped them all out.
- Forefathers?

01:43:12.222 --> 01:43:13.757
Same DNA.

01:43:13.790 --> 01:43:16.826
Wait, so... so the aliens
that built the moon...

01:43:17.693 --> 01:43:19.461
Our ancestors.

01:43:19.495 --> 01:43:20.864
Oh, now, hold on.

01:43:20.897 --> 01:43:23.767
Hold on, because my freaking
brain's just exploded.

01:43:23.800 --> 01:43:24.868
How do you know this?

01:43:26.069 --> 01:43:27.203
I saw it.

01:43:29.773 --> 01:43:31.842
So... so why doesn't this swarm

01:43:31.876 --> 01:43:33.576
just attack the earth
and kill us all?

01:43:33.610 --> 01:43:35.146
If the moon survives,

01:43:35.179 --> 01:43:37.248
they know that organic life
can still be reborn.

01:43:37.281 --> 01:43:39.016
So, it's like it's trying

01:43:39.050 --> 01:43:40.517
to kill two birds
with one stone.

01:43:40.550 --> 01:43:41.786
- That's it.
- Okay.

01:43:41.819 --> 01:43:43.586
Guys...

01:43:43.620 --> 01:43:45.022
Look at this.

01:43:45.056 --> 01:43:47.959
Holy shit.

01:43:47.992 --> 01:43:49.492
It's like we just got
an upgrade.

01:43:49.526 --> 01:43:52.229
They're helping us
kill this thing.

01:43:52.263 --> 01:43:54.198
But we need to let it know
we're here.

01:44:07.044 --> 01:44:08.255
Well, I hate to
tell you this, but, uh,

01:44:08.279 --> 01:44:10.580
we're running out of time.

01:44:10.613 --> 01:44:12.249
Looks like we got
about 10 minutes left,

01:44:12.283 --> 01:44:13.659
and then
the military's gonna launch.

01:44:13.683 --> 01:44:14.995
So if we're gonna
kill this thing,

01:44:15.019 --> 01:44:16.120
we better do it right now.

01:44:16.153 --> 01:44:17.288
No, that can't happen.

01:44:17.321 --> 01:44:18.857
That'll destroy the moon's core.

01:44:19.891 --> 01:44:21.193
I got a plan.

01:44:27.199 --> 01:44:28.499
Brian. Brian.

01:44:30.302 --> 01:44:31.535
I see it.

01:44:35.240 --> 01:44:36.540
Let's go, you son of a bitch.

01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:50.288
It's done something
to our thrusters.

01:44:53.258 --> 01:44:54.760
Ludicrous mode.

01:44:58.330 --> 01:44:59.965
From a navigational standpoint,

01:44:59.998 --> 01:45:01.800
he is going the total wrong way,

01:45:01.833 --> 01:45:03.969
but, uh, I'm not even
gonna say anything.

01:45:21.354 --> 01:45:24.057
Daddy, it's not working anymore.

01:45:24.090 --> 01:45:26.092
- Does it hurt?
- I can't breathe.

01:45:26.125 --> 01:45:27.592
Oh, no.

01:45:28.961 --> 01:45:30.129
Hey, hold your breath, okay?

01:45:32.731 --> 01:45:34.067
Where's Tom and Nikki?

01:45:38.337 --> 01:45:39.939
You know, when you were little,

01:45:39.972 --> 01:45:41.841
I used to hold you like this
to help you walk

01:45:41.874 --> 01:45:46.112
and I'd say,
"left, right, left."

01:45:46.145 --> 01:45:48.314
- Left, yeah, say it with me.
- Left, right, left.

01:45:48.347 --> 01:45:49.749
I'm right behind you.

01:45:49.782 --> 01:45:51.084
Left, right...

01:45:51.117 --> 01:45:53.652
Daddy! Are you okay?

01:45:53.685 --> 01:45:55.688
I'm just gonna rest.
Go find mommy, okay?

01:45:55.721 --> 01:45:57.357
- But, daddy...
- Just keep walking.

01:45:57.391 --> 01:45:58.959
No.

01:45:58.992 --> 01:46:01.028
Left, right, left.

01:46:02.963 --> 01:46:04.898
Left, right, left.

01:46:04.932 --> 01:46:06.400
- Keep going.
- Left.

01:46:06.433 --> 01:46:08.668
- I'm right behind you.
- Left, right, left.

01:46:08.701 --> 01:46:10.237
I love you.

01:46:10.270 --> 01:46:14.741
Left, right, left.

01:46:14.775 --> 01:46:17.778
Left, right, left.

01:46:20.280 --> 01:46:21.647
Here we go again.

01:46:24.384 --> 01:46:25.385
Holy moly!

01:46:26.286 --> 01:46:28.388
More spaceships, people!

01:46:28.422 --> 01:46:30.124
We need to get very close
to those ships.

01:47:22.410 --> 01:47:24.379
Yes! Yes!

01:47:31.453 --> 01:47:33.789
Left, right, left.

01:47:34.957 --> 01:47:36.258
Left, right.

01:47:37.059 --> 01:47:38.127
Honey...

01:47:40.796 --> 01:47:42.131
Where's daddy?

01:47:42.164 --> 01:47:43.899
He was right behind me.

01:47:48.170 --> 01:47:49.405
Tom!

01:47:49.438 --> 01:47:50.873
Hey, when was the last time

01:47:50.906 --> 01:47:52.346
- you saw your daddy?
- I don't know.

01:47:56.946 --> 01:47:58.113
Tom!

01:48:00.082 --> 01:48:01.483
Oxygen's coming back.

01:48:05.154 --> 01:48:06.522
No, no. I'll go look for him.

01:48:06.555 --> 01:48:07.799
- Get out of the way.
- You have to stay here.

01:48:07.823 --> 01:48:09.091
No, Sonny! It's too dangerous.

01:48:09.124 --> 01:48:10.893
You have to take care
of them, okay?

01:48:10.926 --> 01:48:12.761
Go deeper into the tunnel.

01:48:12.795 --> 01:48:14.729
You have to trust me, mom.

01:48:19.469 --> 01:48:21.004
Sonny, look out.

01:48:24.474 --> 01:48:26.176
Sonny!

01:48:27.577 --> 01:48:29.079
I'm gonna go find him.

01:48:29.112 --> 01:48:30.814
Take care of Jimmy
for me, please.

01:48:33.516 --> 01:48:34.517
Sonny!

01:48:36.253 --> 01:48:37.320
Come on, guys.

01:48:58.408 --> 01:48:59.585
The moon's
entered the atmosphere

01:48:59.609 --> 01:49:01.011
over the north Atlantic.

01:49:01.044 --> 01:49:03.213
General, t-minus 20.

01:49:10.554 --> 01:49:12.056
On three.

01:49:13.157 --> 01:49:16.227
Three, two, one.

01:49:20.898 --> 01:49:22.433
Doug, what the hell
are you doing?

01:49:24.402 --> 01:49:26.337
My ex-wife is up there.

01:49:26.370 --> 01:49:28.906
Well, my wife's down here,
and I'm trying to save her.

01:49:28.939 --> 01:49:30.908
Put your damn key
back in the console.

01:49:30.941 --> 01:49:33.077
I don't know how,

01:49:33.110 --> 01:49:35.379
but I believe
that she can save us.

01:49:35.413 --> 01:49:37.615
Give me the damn key.

01:49:37.648 --> 01:49:39.488
What the hell are you doing?
Put that gun down.

01:49:40.251 --> 01:49:41.886
I can't do that.

01:50:10.515 --> 01:50:11.883
Sonny!

01:50:32.003 --> 01:50:34.306
Brian, why are we slowing down?

01:50:34.339 --> 01:50:35.540
Is it behind us?

01:50:39.611 --> 01:50:41.246
I don't see it.

01:50:41.279 --> 01:50:44.550
Jo, I need you to take over
while I get the emp ready.

01:50:46.719 --> 01:50:48.921
I'm staying behind
in the rover with the bomb.

01:50:48.955 --> 01:50:50.795
You and kc take the lander
and get out of here.

01:50:54.293 --> 01:50:57.930
This was your plan?
To use yourself as bait?

01:50:57.964 --> 01:51:00.166
One of us has to stay
in there, or it won't work.

01:51:00.199 --> 01:51:01.667
No. No, no, no, Brian.

01:51:01.701 --> 01:51:03.302
Kc, I need you to go back there,

01:51:03.336 --> 01:51:05.238
and you let me know
if this thing shows up.

01:51:10.009 --> 01:51:11.077
Come on.

01:51:13.413 --> 01:51:15.648
Brian, I'm the director of NASA.

01:51:15.681 --> 01:51:17.350
This is my call, not yours.

01:51:17.383 --> 01:51:18.627
Yeah, I'm the commander
of this mission,

01:51:18.651 --> 01:51:20.119
and I'm staying behind.

01:51:20.153 --> 01:51:21.687
There's gotta be another way.

01:51:21.721 --> 01:51:22.655
No, there's no
other way, Jo. You know that.

01:51:22.688 --> 01:51:24.290
We have to finish this,

01:51:24.323 --> 01:51:26.025
or that thing's gonna finish us.

01:51:32.533 --> 01:51:34.034
What's the matter with you?

01:51:34.067 --> 01:51:35.702
You're putting
the fate of the world

01:51:35.736 --> 01:51:38.439
in the hands of your ex-wife,
and some has-been astronaut.

01:51:38.472 --> 01:51:40.140
She's never let me down before.

01:51:41.575 --> 01:51:43.577
God help you if you're wrong.

01:51:43.610 --> 01:51:45.179
God help us all.

01:51:46.180 --> 01:51:47.247
Sonny.

01:51:49.349 --> 01:51:50.584
Sonny, wake up!

01:51:52.219 --> 01:51:54.221
No, no.

01:51:54.254 --> 01:51:55.757
No, you shouldn't
have come back.

01:51:55.790 --> 01:51:58.459
You don't leave people
behind, okay?

01:51:58.492 --> 01:52:01.462
<i>Brian,
you are not gonna do this.</i>

01:52:03.765 --> 01:52:04.965
Kc!

01:52:06.166 --> 01:52:07.301
Kc!

01:52:07.334 --> 01:52:08.335
Take over.

01:52:09.503 --> 01:52:10.737
Kc.

01:52:10.772 --> 01:52:12.473
What are you doing? No.

01:52:14.241 --> 01:52:16.210
<i>No. What are you doing?</i>

01:52:18.079 --> 01:52:20.157
My mum always said it's better
to beg for forgiveness

01:52:20.181 --> 01:52:21.349
<i>than ask permission.</i>

01:52:21.382 --> 01:52:23.518
<i>No, you open this door.
Open the door!</i>

01:52:23.551 --> 01:52:26.154
<i>Everybody thought I was a joke,</i>

01:52:27.388 --> 01:52:28.656
<i>but you listened to me</i>

01:52:30.158 --> 01:52:31.292
<i>when no one else would.</i>

01:52:32.293 --> 01:52:33.595
Do something for me.

01:52:35.463 --> 01:52:37.232
<i>Check in on my mum.</i>

01:52:39.734 --> 01:52:42.370
<i>Tell her that her son
wasn't a failure.</i>

01:52:44.739 --> 01:52:46.674
<i>No. I am not
letting you do this.</i>

01:52:46.708 --> 01:52:48.309
- <i>Come on.</i>
- Brian,

01:52:48.343 --> 01:52:50.612
<i>you didn't kill that astronaut.</i>

01:52:51.747 --> 01:52:54.349
<i>You saved director Fowler.</i>

01:52:54.382 --> 01:52:57.285
<i>And you're not killing me now.</i>

01:52:57.318 --> 01:53:00.688
<i>You're saving everyone else.</i>

01:53:00.722 --> 01:53:04.325
<i>The world needs you, Brian.</i>

01:53:04.359 --> 01:53:06.763
<i>You're the key
to our moon's knowledge.</i>

01:53:10.366 --> 01:53:13.269
<i>Thanks for believing
my crazy stories.</i>

01:53:14.503 --> 01:53:16.105
<i>You're not crazy.</i>

01:53:39.461 --> 01:53:41.865
Guys, there's something
I need to get off my chest.

01:53:41.898 --> 01:53:43.867
I'm not a real doctor.

01:53:43.900 --> 01:53:45.434
<i>I just put that
on my business cards</i>

01:53:45.467 --> 01:53:46.702
<i>'cause it sounded cool.</i>

01:53:46.735 --> 01:53:50.372
Go save the world, Dr. Houseman.

01:54:19.202 --> 01:54:20.805
You underestimated us.

01:54:35.318 --> 01:54:36.319
Get out of here.

01:54:38.688 --> 01:54:41.459
Sonny, the moon
is going to help us.

01:54:41.492 --> 01:54:42.761
Come on, try again!

01:54:42.794 --> 01:54:44.830
Here it comes. Now!

01:55:00.277 --> 01:55:01.545
We have incoming!

01:55:36.749 --> 01:55:38.483
Come on, bri.

01:55:38.517 --> 01:55:40.285
I'm gonna get you home.

01:56:06.278 --> 01:56:07.847
Sonny.

01:56:09.448 --> 01:56:10.582
Sonny.

01:56:18.992 --> 01:56:21.227
Thank you
for bringing him back to me.

01:56:41.380 --> 01:56:43.016
Mom? Is that you?

01:56:45.418 --> 01:56:47.620
Yeah. They're here.
Where are you?

01:56:49.455 --> 01:56:51.724
Isn't the Chrysler building
in New York?

01:57:06.908 --> 01:57:07.909
You okay?

01:57:10.544 --> 01:57:12.847
Yeah. What'd I miss?

01:57:12.881 --> 01:57:15.449
Well, the kids are okay.
And earth,

01:57:16.818 --> 01:57:19.386
surprisingly,
it's still in one piece.

01:57:22.656 --> 01:57:24.759
You know, if earth
gets a second chance,

01:57:26.060 --> 01:57:27.829
I think we deserve one, too.

01:57:29.964 --> 01:57:30.965
I'd like that.

01:57:36.771 --> 01:57:38.840
Is that a tracking device?

01:57:38.873 --> 01:57:40.574
I sure hope so.

01:57:43.845 --> 01:57:45.646
We make a pretty good team, huh?

01:57:47.614 --> 01:57:50.051
Yeah, we do.

01:58:20.783 --> 01:58:22.684
Jimmy!

01:58:22.717 --> 01:58:25.120
Dad!

01:58:31.559 --> 01:58:33.695
We never made it to dad.

01:58:33.728 --> 01:58:35.064
That's okay.

01:58:40.668 --> 01:58:41.938
Where's Tom?

01:58:44.040 --> 01:58:46.575
I'm so sorry.

01:58:50.512 --> 01:58:52.152
We wouldn't have made
it here without him.

01:58:54.717 --> 01:58:55.752
Where's your friend?

01:58:57.888 --> 01:58:59.055
He, uh...

01:59:01.024 --> 01:59:03.726
He saved the world.

01:59:03.760 --> 01:59:05.461
And that one, too.

01:59:39.096 --> 01:59:40.131
Uh...

01:59:40.998 --> 01:59:42.066
Hello?

01:59:46.270 --> 01:59:47.537
Hello?

02:00:00.017 --> 02:00:01.786
Fuzz aldrin.

02:00:04.654 --> 02:00:06.123
You did well.

02:00:12.930 --> 02:00:13.998
Mum.

02:00:16.700 --> 02:00:18.203
What is this?

02:00:20.105 --> 02:00:22.140
Am I still alive?

02:00:22.174 --> 02:00:24.709
We scanned your consciousness.

02:00:24.742 --> 02:00:26.078
You're part of the moon now.

02:00:27.913 --> 02:00:30.182
No freakin' way.

02:00:33.718 --> 02:00:34.786
So...

02:00:39.257 --> 02:00:41.559
We saved the earth.

02:00:44.262 --> 02:00:46.031
We should get started.

02:00:48.767 --> 02:00:50.601
Get started with what?
