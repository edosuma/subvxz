00:06.000 --> 00:09.958
<i>Dr Jackson, you
have a new theory about the Stargate?</i>

00:09.960 --> 00:12.249
Uh, yes, sir.

00:13.919 --> 00:16.492
OK. Uh...

00:17.158 --> 00:18.736
If you study myths worldwide,

00:18.760 --> 00:22.759
it looks as if there were
two different kinds of star gods.

00:23.681 --> 00:27.640
The tyrants, who treated their subjects
like cattle, demanded obedience,

00:27.640 --> 00:31.388
- Used technology to punish and control.
- As in the Goa'uld.

00:32.280 --> 00:34.356
And the culture bearers,

00:34.360 --> 00:37.720
who used knowledge and technology
to benefit humans.

00:37.720 --> 00:41.759
So the Goa'ulds weren't the only aliens
to visit Earth in the past.

00:41.759 --> 00:43.835
Well, how does that affect us today?

00:43.840 --> 00:46.959
We don't think the Goa'uld
built the Stargate system.

00:46.960 --> 00:51.960
Being parasitic by nature, they just used it
to become a dominant race in the galaxy.

00:51.960 --> 00:55.479
But the good gods, who liked humans,
might have used it too.

00:55.481 --> 00:57.600
And they could still be out there.

00:57.600 --> 01:01.929
- Any indications of who they are?
- Yes, sir. The Vikings.

01:04.078 --> 01:07.719
Now, in Norse mythology,
the gods were powerful warriors.

01:07.721 --> 01:10.039
Legend tells us that the God Thor

01:10.040 --> 01:13.641
was a friend to humans
and protected them from the Etins,

01:13.641 --> 01:18.759
beings of great power and knowledge
who were enemies of mankind.

01:18.760 --> 01:22.628
He used a weapon called Thor's hammer.

01:23.481 --> 01:28.081
When Thor hurled the hammer, it was
said to produce thunder and lightning.

01:28.081 --> 01:32.079
Now, that could indicate
some advanced type of energy weapon.

01:32.081 --> 01:35.161
Sir, I think what Daniel's trying to say is

01:35.162 --> 01:39.121
if there are aliens out there
who are hostile to the Goa'ulds

01:39.121 --> 01:42.987
and have equal or superior fire power,
we oughta look 'em up.

01:43.921 --> 01:47.171
- They could be allies.
- I have seen the hammer sign before.

01:49.361 --> 01:52.602
It is the symbol
of a world called Cimmeria.

01:52.602 --> 01:55.920
All Jaffa are taught the sequence
of Stargate symbols to it.

01:55.920 --> 01:59.281
- Why is that, Teal'c?
- To ensure that no Goa'uld goes there.

01:59.281 --> 02:04.239
It is forbidden. Something transpired on
Cimmeria that no Goa'uld will speak of.

02:05.322 --> 02:08.572
- Well, I like the sound of that.
- So do I, Colonel.

02:10.080 --> 02:12.157
All right. You have a go.

02:17.521 --> 02:21.881
Colonel, we'd like you to
take this along with you. It's a gift.

02:21.882 --> 02:23.673
Gee, sir. I don't know what to say.

02:23.681 --> 02:27.762
For the alien friendlies in the event
you succeed in making contact.

02:27.762 --> 02:29.920
Oh, you had it made! That's great.

02:32.682 --> 02:36.001
We asked the Sagan Institute
to imagine a greeting from Earth,

02:36.002 --> 02:39.240
if they could hypothetically
get it to a distant world.

02:39.240 --> 02:43.961
It's all about who we are. It explains
various cultures, religions, histories.

02:43.961 --> 02:46.168
<i>Chevron one encoded.</i>

02:54.201 --> 02:56.277
<i>Chevron two encoded.</i>

02:56.283 --> 02:58.774
Time to go to work.

03:48.444 --> 03:49.771
This is... different.

03:49.804 --> 03:51.263
Daniel...

03:51.283 --> 03:53.158
You're on.

03:53.163 --> 03:55.037
<i>Thor!</i>

03:55.043 --> 03:57.036
<i>Thor! Thor!</i>

03:57.043 --> 03:59.581
Thor! Thor! Thor!

04:06.802 --> 04:09.641
Sounds like it's building up
some kind of charge.

04:09.643 --> 04:12.002
Thor! Thor! Thor!

04:12.003 --> 04:14.483
Daniel, dial home. We're goin' back - now.

04:14.484 --> 04:16.882
- Why?
- Just do it. That's an order.

04:16.882 --> 04:17.915
Thor! Thor!

04:32.644 --> 04:34.187
Teal'c! Get outta there!

05:54.206 --> 05:56.411
I think that this is Thor's hammer.

05:59.884 --> 06:02.970
I... I think they're dead.

06:03.245 --> 06:06.204
I don't wanna hear that.
You said Thor liked humans.

06:06.206 --> 06:08.964
That he used his weapon to protect them.

06:08.964 --> 06:13.324
We go back, we bring another SG team
through, and we start a search.

06:13.324 --> 06:15.199
<i>Wait.</i>

06:30.406 --> 06:33.276
You're a little short for gods.

06:36.045 --> 06:39.415
But you came through
the portal unharmed.

06:40.086 --> 06:43.336
So you must be from Thrudvang,
Thor's home in the stars.

06:44.446 --> 06:48.608
- Hail and welcome.
- Actually, we're not, uh...

06:49.125 --> 06:52.605
I'm Captain Samantha Carter.
This is Daniel Jackson.

06:52.606 --> 06:57.351
My name is Gairwyn. I am mistress here.
My husband has gone a-viking.

06:57.966 --> 07:00.206
Um... trading, fighting.

07:00.206 --> 07:04.005
That was in the old days. Nowadays
they go to the towns to look for work.

07:04.007 --> 07:06.925
It's been a hard season for farmers.
Water is scarce.

07:06.927 --> 07:09.887
- But you're welcome at my table.
- Thank you.

07:09.887 --> 07:12.444
Yeah, but we have a serious problem.

07:12.446 --> 07:15.766
Two of the men who came through
the portal with us are gone.

07:15.766 --> 07:19.045
Yes. I heard there were
two Etins in your company.

07:19.047 --> 07:21.567
- Etins?
- Goa'ulds?

07:21.567 --> 07:23.643
You think Teal'c and Jack are Goa'ulds?

07:23.646 --> 07:27.565
- You tricked them here to be rid of them?
- No! They're friends.

07:27.567 --> 07:30.319
And if they're alive, we need to find them.

07:32.487 --> 07:35.966
<i>- You're humans. Like us!
- Yes!</i>

07:35.966 --> 07:39.526
You and I may even have
some of the same ancestors.

07:39.528 --> 07:42.726
We came here from a different world.

07:42.728 --> 07:44.600
- From Earth.
- Midgardr.

07:45.966 --> 07:50.566
Then we are your brothers and sisters.
Midgardr is the ancient home.

07:50.567 --> 07:53.983
Thor brought our people here
and made this to keep us safe.

07:55.608 --> 07:58.100
Do you... Do you know how this works?

07:58.646 --> 08:00.521
Are they dead?

08:00.526 --> 08:02.925
It's a magic beyond our ken.

08:02.927 --> 08:07.086
It's said that Thor will come back one day
and teach us when we are... older.

08:07.088 --> 08:11.206
Gairwyn, would Thor kill a human being
in order to kill an Etin?

08:11.206 --> 08:15.846
Never. Our gods are powerful warriors,
but they are just and true to their word.

08:15.848 --> 08:18.687
- So they may be alive?
- Who might know where they are?

08:18.687 --> 08:20.146
Only one.

08:20.168 --> 08:24.687
<i>We call her Kendra. Ten seasons ago she
walked through the portal and was taken.</i>

08:24.687 --> 08:26.062
Taken? Where?

08:26.086 --> 08:29.456
Hunters found her wandering
half-frozen in the mountains.

08:30.408 --> 08:34.128
Maybe the beam transported them
somewhere else on the planet.

08:34.128 --> 08:36.167
Where can we find this Kendra?

08:36.168 --> 08:39.687
She lives by herself.
I take her things now and then.

08:39.687 --> 08:43.006
We can't spare the horses
but I can take you there on foot.

08:43.008 --> 08:45.794
- Absolutely. Please.
- This way.

09:03.528 --> 09:05.402
Teal'c?

09:19.690 --> 09:21.562
Is Junior OK?

09:23.168 --> 09:24.995
Yes.

09:25.009 --> 09:28.687
But the beam caused
the Goa'uld I carry great pain.

09:28.688 --> 09:31.226
<i>I'm sorry to hear that.</i>

09:35.369 --> 09:36.994
Whoa.

09:42.529 --> 09:45.209
<i>- Hello.
- I am Thor.</i>

09:45.210 --> 09:47.729
Supreme commander of the Asgard fleet.

09:47.729 --> 09:50.847
The High Council of Asgard
has designated Cimmeria

09:50.849 --> 09:54.128
a safe world for
developing sentient species

09:54.129 --> 09:57.913
by unanimous decree, era 40.73.29.

09:58.850 --> 10:01.250
The Goa'uld System Lords
were so informed.

10:01.250 --> 10:03.740
Uh, we're not Goa'ulds.

10:04.330 --> 10:08.208
He carries one around in him, but he
doesn't have much choice in the matter.

10:08.210 --> 10:11.957
You were warned not to come here,
under pain of death.

10:12.330 --> 10:15.448
Look, I'm Colonel Jack O'Neill from Earth.

10:16.408 --> 10:18.889
I know you spent
some time there in our past.

10:18.889 --> 10:23.649
For crimes against the living host and all
those you have murdered and enslaved,

10:23.649 --> 10:25.442
the sentence is death.

10:28.370 --> 10:30.446
Look, uh...

10:31.250 --> 10:34.750
We came here to... see you.

10:36.450 --> 10:41.209
This is your prison.
Your technology will not function here.

10:41.210 --> 10:45.328
There are no luxuries,
no worshippers, no slaves to...

10:45.330 --> 10:48.409
Teal'c, I think we just got
the answering machine.

10:48.409 --> 10:51.528
<i>Only basic sustenance... and time.</i>

10:51.529 --> 10:54.150
Yeah, well, thanks. Thanks for the chat.

10:55.650 --> 10:58.735
We should hear the remainder
of the message.

10:59.690 --> 11:04.090
When you tire of this existence,
go to the Hall of Mjolnir

11:04.090 --> 11:06.461
and face the hammer.

11:07.529 --> 11:11.860
There is no escape. Only the host
can leave this place... alive.

11:19.610 --> 11:22.067
- A Goa'uld trap?
- So it would seem.

11:23.451 --> 11:28.090
If I attempt to leave this place,
the Goa'uld I carry will be destroyed.

11:28.090 --> 11:30.166
By a hammer.

11:30.890 --> 11:32.966
You must leave without me.

11:33.532 --> 11:35.607
If I stay, I will remain safe.

11:37.051 --> 11:40.549
Just relax, Teal'c. I'm not goin' anywhere.

11:41.490 --> 11:43.691
Let's just find this...

11:43.692 --> 11:46.894
Hall of Mohair, or whatever it's called.

12:13.812 --> 12:15.970
- No!
- Shh!

12:17.130 --> 12:19.703
It's all right.

12:27.011 --> 12:30.770
Rune light, flow in might and main.

12:30.772 --> 12:32.847
Knit the bones and take the pain.

12:44.611 --> 12:47.946
Now, the next time you want a fight,
choose a boy your own size.

13:03.131 --> 13:05.884
Gairwyn, my friend! Hail and welcome.

13:06.653 --> 13:08.729
This is Carter, and Daniel.

13:08.731 --> 13:10.440
- Hail.
- Hi.

13:10.452 --> 13:11.947
Hail.

13:11.972 --> 13:16.373
They came through the portal
from Midgardr. They need your help.

13:16.373 --> 13:20.130
- What did you just do to that boy?
- He had a broken wrist. I healed it.

13:20.131 --> 13:21.674
Then why did he run away?

13:24.131 --> 13:26.374
Because of this.

13:27.412 --> 13:30.331
<i>It is the mark of what I used to be.</i>

13:30.332 --> 13:32.731
A Goa'uld taking over
a human is permanent.

13:32.732 --> 13:37.644
Not here. Thor's hammer drove it from
my body and restored me to my true self.

13:38.812 --> 13:42.371
The "it"... You mean the parasite
that was inside of you?

13:42.371 --> 13:44.495
Is gone.

13:45.211 --> 13:47.004
Oh, my God.

13:47.013 --> 13:49.211
Thor's hammer... The stone by the gate?

13:49.212 --> 13:51.893
No. The hammer is deep
inside the mountain.

13:51.893 --> 13:55.759
As long as I have known her,
Kendra has harmed no one.

13:57.013 --> 14:01.674
My wife - Sha're -
is now as you... once were.

14:02.734 --> 14:06.653
She has been taken by a Goa'uld and...
if what you're saying is true...

14:06.653 --> 14:09.332
- It is true.
- Then help us.

14:09.333 --> 14:11.788
Help us to find our friends.

14:15.095 --> 14:18.453
You should not have attempted
to rescue me from the beam.

14:18.453 --> 14:22.131
If you had not done so,
you would not be here now.

14:22.133 --> 14:24.375
Ah, you'd have done the same for me.

14:25.333 --> 14:30.837
Of course, I wouldn't be walkin' around
with a Goa'uld larva in my gut, but hey...

14:44.614 --> 14:45.645
Ouch.

14:47.933 --> 14:50.851
These Goa'ulds died
with their human hosts.

14:51.294 --> 14:54.773
The marks on these bones
are from a cutting instrument.

14:54.773 --> 14:57.644
- But not metal.
- What, then?

14:58.215 --> 15:01.613
I believe they were made
by large, powerful teeth.

15:01.614 --> 15:04.933
These bodies did not die
of natural causes.

15:04.934 --> 15:07.342
They were killed... and then eaten.

15:09.815 --> 15:12.894
It's obvious some wild animal
found its way in.

15:12.894 --> 15:15.533
There's gotta be a way out.

15:15.534 --> 15:17.610
We find it... we're gone.

15:40.696 --> 15:42.772
I call it the Labyrinth.

15:43.735 --> 15:47.436
It is the place where
the Goa'uld are destroyed.

15:51.655 --> 15:54.609
How is it done? Did you feel it?

15:55.495 --> 15:58.163
- Yes.
- And was it painful?

16:02.015 --> 16:06.309
It was nothing compared to the suffering
I watched myself inflict on others.

16:10.775 --> 16:12.649
And for all those years.

16:13.894 --> 16:15.852
So many.

16:16.536 --> 16:20.975
Your human friend O'Neill,
he can walk out unharmed.

16:20.975 --> 16:23.293
All you need do is wait.

16:23.294 --> 16:26.176
Teal'c is our friend, too.
He's Jaffa, not Goa'uld.

16:26.177 --> 16:29.096
Jaffa? A friend?

16:29.096 --> 16:33.654
- They are as guilty as those they serve.
- This Jaffa gave up his rank, his home,

16:33.654 --> 16:35.813
to join us and fight the Goa'uld.

16:35.816 --> 16:38.054
His dream is to see his people free.

16:38.056 --> 16:42.135
But if the Goa'uld larva within him
is removed, he will die.

16:42.136 --> 16:46.456
See, once a Jaffa carries a larva,
it acts as his immune system.

16:46.456 --> 16:49.076
I know all I want to know of Jaffa.

16:49.735 --> 16:50.933
Right.

16:54.856 --> 16:59.817
If the hammer drives the Goa'uld
from him and he dies, so be it.

16:59.817 --> 17:04.096
<i>- It is his penance for serving the Goa'uld!
- Teal'c was in the service of Apophis.</i>

17:04.096 --> 17:08.924
But he saved our lives and
helped us escape. He is one of us now.

17:17.415 --> 17:19.624
Did I ask your counsel?!

17:23.217 --> 17:26.002
The Valkyrie ride the wind.

17:27.576 --> 17:29.976
They want me to help you.

17:29.977 --> 17:32.468
They say you speak the truth.

17:33.695 --> 17:35.984
They tell me...

17:36.656 --> 17:38.863
that I must take you there.

17:44.536 --> 17:46.612
This is right.

17:48.217 --> 17:50.292
Go with Thor, my friend.

17:56.537 --> 17:58.826
I will take you.

18:00.576 --> 18:03.530
But first I must consult the runes.

18:28.377 --> 18:32.077
Teal'c... Take a shot at that lamp
with your staff weapon.

18:39.498 --> 18:41.371
It will not function.

18:41.377 --> 18:44.913
Yeah, that's what he said would happen
as long as we're in here.

18:49.097 --> 18:53.843
<i>This race may have dismissed
projectile weapons as too primitive.</i>

19:00.698 --> 19:02.773
Yeah. Here.

19:12.219 --> 19:16.050
The message said only the host
could leave this place alive.

19:16.617 --> 19:18.242
Right.

19:18.259 --> 19:21.337
Perhaps this could benefit
the boy who was your friend.

19:21.338 --> 19:23.960
Skaara. Yeah, I thought of that.

19:24.698 --> 19:28.857
And the wife of Daniel Jackson.
Perhaps, if they could be brought here,

19:28.858 --> 19:33.017
the Goa'uld who took them
as hosts could be purged.

19:33.018 --> 19:35.307
<i>Yeah, maybe.</i>

19:40.459 --> 19:42.535
What is it, O'Neill?

19:43.699 --> 19:45.856
Nothing.

19:47.499 --> 19:49.040
Never mind.

20:04.219 --> 20:07.218
Mighty Thor, God of
thunder and lightning,

20:07.219 --> 20:09.544
wield your hammer and protect me.

20:10.940 --> 20:12.896
Now wait with me in the circle.

20:12.898 --> 20:16.338
- For what?
- A sign from Thor himself.

20:16.339 --> 20:18.617
Great. Another sign.

20:18.618 --> 20:23.743
She's probably afraid to go back there.
Maybe if we offer her moral support...

20:27.380 --> 20:30.250
How much do you remember
of your life... before?

20:31.380 --> 20:33.039
Much.

20:34.460 --> 20:36.536
I was a beautiful child.

20:37.859 --> 20:39.852
<i>Is that bad?</i>

20:39.858 --> 20:43.460
- On Jebanna, beauty is a curse.
- I don't understand.

20:43.461 --> 20:46.794
- Because the Goa'uld want perfect hosts?
- Yes.

20:49.779 --> 20:52.019
What happened?

20:52.019 --> 20:57.441
Marduk discovered our secret and raided
the temple where they tried to hide me.

20:57.980 --> 20:59.855
I'm sorry.

20:59.861 --> 21:02.269
Because of my training in the temple,

21:03.220 --> 21:06.259
the Goa'uld
who took possession of my body

21:06.260 --> 21:09.619
could not take complete control
over my mind.

21:09.621 --> 21:12.421
A part of me, my self, remained.

21:12.421 --> 21:15.089
Something of the host survives.

21:17.140 --> 21:19.013
How did you end up here?

21:19.020 --> 21:22.299
Teal'c said the Goa'uld made this
a forbidden planet ages ago.

21:22.300 --> 21:24.740
And so it is.

21:24.740 --> 21:28.980
But I knew my beast.
She hungered for conquest.

21:28.980 --> 21:31.900
So I became a voice within.

21:31.901 --> 21:35.259
I taunted her, and
whispered of rumours that...

21:35.260 --> 21:39.182
Cimmeria must hold a wealth of riches
for one bold enough to take it.

21:39.182 --> 21:42.220
You influenced the Goa'uld
that had taken you over?

21:42.221 --> 21:44.509
Yes. She came to Cimmeria.

21:45.980 --> 21:48.138
And I hoped only for a quick death.

21:49.300 --> 21:50.961
Escape.

21:51.700 --> 21:54.107
But we were taken into the Labyrinth.

21:55.582 --> 21:58.287
A dark and terrifying place.

22:01.340 --> 22:05.208
Until Thor's hammer set me free.

22:05.461 --> 22:08.794
And I have honoured his ways
and his people ever since.

22:13.421 --> 22:16.705
It is a sign from Thor. Now we can go.

22:18.701 --> 22:20.444
Water.

22:21.461 --> 22:24.180
Give it enough time, it'll bring down walls.

22:24.181 --> 22:26.257
Even walls just like that.

22:27.382 --> 22:30.169
So in a coupla hundred years,
we'll be free.

22:35.582 --> 22:37.871
What the hell is that?

22:48.982 --> 22:50.525
Jaffa!

22:52.342 --> 22:56.837
I am Unas, the First One.

22:57.781 --> 23:01.566
You... do not... exist.

23:04.142 --> 23:06.977
- Kill the human.
- Excuse me?

23:08.143 --> 23:11.862
And we will feast... together.

23:11.863 --> 23:14.068
I no longer serve the Goa'uld.

23:16.301 --> 23:19.382
Ahhhh... We shall see.

23:19.383 --> 23:22.467
- Just stay right there.
- Weapons are of no use here.

23:44.742 --> 23:47.502
The First One... is dead.

23:47.503 --> 23:50.041
Yeah, well, that's fine by me. Come on.

24:45.223 --> 24:46.884
What?

24:47.223 --> 24:51.103
Teal'c, will you relax?
That thing's dead, for cryin' out loud.

24:51.104 --> 24:52.763
I believe I heard a sound.

24:52.784 --> 24:56.222
There wouldn't be two
of those things in here.

24:56.223 --> 24:58.423
Would there?

24:58.423 --> 25:01.839
If there were, they would
surely battle to the death.

25:02.625 --> 25:06.457
So what did you mean when
you told that thing it didn't exist?

25:08.064 --> 25:10.942
Unas is believed
to have been the first host.

25:10.943 --> 25:14.743
Born of the same primordial waters
as the Goa'uld.

25:14.744 --> 25:17.903
It became a myth -
much like your vampire.

25:17.903 --> 25:19.397
That thing was a Goa'uld?

25:21.424 --> 25:24.304
- Yes.
- I thought they preferred human hosts.

25:24.305 --> 25:29.064
There are other species far older
that have been used as hosts.

25:29.065 --> 25:31.744
Some of immeasurable
power and savagery.

25:31.744 --> 25:34.384
I wonder how long
it's been trapped down here.

25:34.385 --> 25:36.863
Perhaps a thousand years.

25:36.864 --> 25:39.743
Unas can utilise
long periods of sleep to survive.

25:39.744 --> 25:44.824
<i>It is dead, right? We don't have to go back
there and drive a stake through its chest?</i>

25:44.824 --> 25:48.904
The old stories say Unas had
great regenerative powers.

25:49.424 --> 25:53.338
But those are tales told
to frighten children. It is a myth.

25:53.506 --> 25:54.537
Ah.

25:56.065 --> 25:59.480
- It was dead.
- That's good.

26:00.904 --> 26:02.565
I believe.

26:03.986 --> 26:06.061
You believe?

26:08.384 --> 26:10.461
I am certain.

26:10.464 --> 26:12.955
- Positive?
- I am.

26:13.625 --> 26:16.144
Just a myth?

26:16.145 --> 26:18.384
A myth.

26:18.384 --> 26:20.093
Good.

26:29.746 --> 26:32.265
We're not lost. Are we?

26:32.265 --> 26:36.926
It was long ago. Everything was covered
with snow. It all looks different now.

26:38.547 --> 26:40.585
Kendra...

26:40.586 --> 26:43.622
It's all right. Just... take your time.

26:48.464 --> 26:50.173
Kendra...

26:51.105 --> 26:56.746
When the Goa'uld was destroyed
within you, what did it feel like exactly?

26:56.746 --> 27:00.660
- Your wife?
- I have to know if there's any hope.

27:03.787 --> 27:06.905
It was very painful. Like...

27:07.704 --> 27:10.944
needles stabbing inside the head.

27:10.945 --> 27:15.705
The beast will do anything to
stay in control. It's a battle of wills.

27:15.707 --> 27:17.782
Many give up.

27:17.787 --> 27:21.506
Well, Sha're wasn't trained
in a temple, like you.

27:21.506 --> 27:23.961
But she had a spirit. She was a fighter.

27:24.987 --> 27:29.065
- You loved her very much.
- I still do. I dream about her.

27:29.066 --> 27:32.826
It's as if some part of her
is reaching out to me.

27:32.826 --> 27:38.785
- Or maybe that's just wishful thinking.
- No. You still are connected.

27:38.786 --> 27:43.032
If you find her and bring her here,
I believe there is hope.

27:44.145 --> 27:45.177
Thank you.

27:48.707 --> 27:51.910
I'm sure now. This is the way.

28:29.907 --> 28:31.983
OK.

28:31.989 --> 28:34.065
That's no myth.

28:43.587 --> 28:46.508
Gairwyn told me
Thor built this centuries ago.

28:46.508 --> 28:50.386
It brings the water from the mountain
to his people in the towns.

28:50.387 --> 28:52.547
<i>- Thor is generous.
- Yes.</i>

28:52.548 --> 28:54.458
This means we are close.

28:57.188 --> 29:00.188
Daniel, she said that hours ago!

29:00.189 --> 29:05.186
- Either she's lost and won't admit it or...
- I don't think that she would mislead us.

29:05.188 --> 29:09.269
Maybe it's not on purpose.
Maybe it's not even conscious.

29:10.788 --> 29:15.666
What she suffered on her world and while
being a Goa'uld was incredible abuse.

29:15.667 --> 29:19.387
She interpreted those gusts of wind
and thunder as signs.

29:19.388 --> 29:22.347
Part of her wants to face it again
and part of her doesn't.

29:22.347 --> 29:24.423
And the part that doesn't is winning.

29:24.429 --> 29:26.337
We're wasting valuable time.

29:26.347 --> 29:28.666
OK. Gairwyn said that hunters found her.

29:28.667 --> 29:33.107
Well, hunters don't travel
in a straight line. They follow game.

29:33.108 --> 29:35.627
They would not risk hunger
to get her back sooner.

29:35.627 --> 29:40.427
Daniel, your belief that Kendra can
somehow help bring Sha're back to you

29:40.429 --> 29:43.714
doesn't make it true.
And it doesn't make her reliable!

29:44.189 --> 29:47.867
Haven't you ever had a feeling
that made no logical sense,

29:47.867 --> 29:49.943
and it turned out to be right?

29:51.548 --> 29:53.541
<i>This way!</i>

30:12.789 --> 30:15.469
<i>You sure we didn't
come this way before?</i>

30:15.470 --> 30:18.988
<i>- We have not.
- It looks awfully familiar.</i>

30:18.989 --> 30:21.628
Your weapons cannot kill me!

30:21.630 --> 30:25.413
I know the secrets of the Labyrinth.

30:26.108 --> 30:28.102
I could help you escape.

30:28.108 --> 30:29.651
A map would be nice.

30:37.029 --> 30:39.105
Come on.

30:48.909 --> 30:50.568
There!

31:11.910 --> 31:13.903
The hammer!

31:13.911 --> 31:16.630
<i>- Yes. This is where I came out.
- OK, good.</i>

31:16.631 --> 31:19.336
What do you remember
about the Labyrinth?

31:20.790 --> 31:24.740
It's difficult. My beast wandered
forward and back many times.

31:25.109 --> 31:28.509
I do remember the entrance
where Thor speaks to the Goa'ulds.

31:28.509 --> 31:32.190
- Thor is inside?
- He seems to be.

31:32.191 --> 31:34.949
But he speaks the same message
again and again.

31:34.950 --> 31:37.323
My beast believed he was not real.

31:38.631 --> 31:43.173
There were long tunnels,
leading from one room to another.

31:45.550 --> 31:48.920
And... something else in there.

31:50.470 --> 31:53.230
Something... alive.

31:53.230 --> 31:56.018
- What?!
- I don't know.

32:00.352 --> 32:04.516
Look, you don't have to go any further
if you don't want to. OK?

32:13.871 --> 32:15.946
Thor asks that I try.

32:36.192 --> 32:39.442
Yeah, this is it!
We're outta here! Let's go!

32:42.311 --> 32:43.722
Aaarghhh..!

32:43.751 --> 32:45.211
Teal'c! Get outta there!

32:45.231 --> 32:47.438
Aaaarrgghhh..!

32:56.471 --> 32:59.176
- Thank you, O'Neill.
- Yeah.

33:05.832 --> 33:08.583
If I am to die, it will be as a warrior,

33:10.031 --> 33:12.522
facing my enemy.

33:14.872 --> 33:17.112
Last mag.

33:17.113 --> 33:19.685
Hell... Why not?

33:28.511 --> 33:32.461
<i>- It's OK. Stay here.
- You've done more than enough, really.</i>

33:34.512 --> 33:38.380
In the temple we were taught
that fear is the greatest enemy.

33:39.551 --> 33:41.627
I must face my fear.

34:06.873 --> 34:09.197
Are you considering the same tactic as I?

34:10.072 --> 34:13.592
Teal'c, the clichÃ© is:
are you thinking what I'm thinking?

34:13.594 --> 34:15.550
And the answer is yes.

34:15.552 --> 34:17.378
<i>Human.</i>

34:18.032 --> 34:20.108
You can save yourself.

34:21.992 --> 34:24.068
Why do you stay?

34:28.873 --> 34:34.746
Jaffa, why do you ally yourself
with a slave?

34:36.193 --> 34:40.655
Once, the Goa'uld were all as Unas.

34:41.672 --> 34:43.748
We were few,

34:44.672 --> 34:47.543
but we ruled millions.

34:48.074 --> 34:53.072
We fed upon the weak
to keep ourselves strong.

34:53.072 --> 34:55.672
I will take pleasure

34:55.672 --> 34:58.246
in killing and devouring you both!

35:24.873 --> 35:27.626
- They're in trouble.
- It's still alive.

35:30.514 --> 35:34.724
We're so close! Feel around the door.
See if there's a trigger.

35:44.355 --> 35:46.431
There's one more thing I can try.

35:46.434 --> 35:49.601
I learned this from
the songs of Thor's people.

35:53.673 --> 35:58.465
Carve the rune flow, read the might,
see the rainbow, test the wight!

36:21.074 --> 36:25.025
- Teal'c!
- There is no other way!

37:05.916 --> 37:10.237
Without the healing power of the Goa'uld,
his body will no longer regenerate.

37:10.237 --> 37:12.275
There is too much damage.

37:14.077 --> 37:16.875
Now I see why they call you friend.

37:16.876 --> 37:19.083
This is Kendra. She brought us here.

37:20.237 --> 37:24.483
She had first-hand knowledge.
She was... a Goa'uld.

37:28.436 --> 37:30.643
The hammer works.

37:33.275 --> 37:35.351
Do you know what this means?

37:36.036 --> 37:38.657
It's the only way outta here, Daniel.

37:40.277 --> 37:42.597
But what this can do
for Sha're and Skaara...

37:42.597 --> 37:45.349
- Teal'c is here now.
- And here I will remain.

37:47.717 --> 37:49.956
I was with those
who took the ones you love.

37:49.956 --> 37:51.914
No.

37:51.916 --> 37:55.867
You're part of this family now.
We're not leaving you behind.

38:05.237 --> 38:09.186
This thing won't work in here.
Try it from out there.

38:28.398 --> 38:29.856
Come on.

38:44.836 --> 38:47.291
- Did it work?
- There's one way to find out.

39:14.838 --> 39:16.914
Thank you, Daniel Jackson.

39:21.878 --> 39:24.664
Well, at least we know
it can be done, right?

39:31.360 --> 39:34.518
Now that the hammer is lost,
I'm not sure what we'll do.

39:34.518 --> 39:39.597
You should be all right. The Goa'uld
don't know the hammer was destroyed.

39:39.599 --> 39:43.976
Seal up the cave. If they come back,
at least they'll be somewhere safe.

39:45.079 --> 39:47.036
I want to thank you

39:47.038 --> 39:51.416
for helping me have the courage
to face my greatest fears.

39:58.518 --> 40:02.516
This is... to remember our world.

40:06.798 --> 40:07.961
Thank you.

40:08.920 --> 40:10.164
We will never forget.

40:14.878 --> 40:17.630
And we'd like to come back.

40:17.878 --> 40:20.085
Oh! I almost forgot.

40:23.759 --> 40:25.835
Here. It's a gift.

40:27.400 --> 40:30.759
It's for Thor, or his people,
in case they ever come back.

40:30.760 --> 40:33.925
It's all about our people.
We would like to be friends.

40:37.838 --> 40:40.878
<i>- Ah! Thor is pleased.
- That's great.</i>

40:40.880 --> 40:44.463
Tell him we'd love to meet him
someday... in person.

40:46.201 --> 40:49.559
It is safe for you to travel.
You should go now.

40:49.559 --> 40:52.264
Daniel? Wanna start dialling home...

40:52.800 --> 40:56.050
- Before it starts raining?
- Right.
