'em deceased.

00:09.313 --> 00:10.706
Couple in their 30s

00:10.749 --> 00:12.447
checked in last night
with their son.

00:12.490 --> 00:14.666
- Foster home.

00:16.407 --> 00:19.802
Julian, can you tell me
what happened that morning?

00:19.845 --> 00:22.065
What happened to your parents?

00:22.109 --> 00:23.501
- They died.

00:23.545 --> 00:25.286
- Jimsonweed.

00:25.329 --> 00:27.157
If you drink
a tea made from it

00:27.201 --> 00:28.506
it'll kill you.

00:28.550 --> 00:31.379
- I gave the tea to them.

00:33.424 --> 00:36.166
- Where are all
of Julian's things?

00:36.210 --> 00:37.689
- Oh, my God.

00:37.733 --> 00:39.169
What kind of parents
go on a trip

00:39.213 --> 00:41.345
and don't pack a bag
for their kid?

00:41.389 --> 00:43.173
- The boy who was taken
into custody,

00:43.217 --> 00:44.566
I need to know
where he's being held.

00:44.609 --> 00:47.569
I'm his mother.

01:11.245 --> 01:13.203
Yo, wait up, wait up!

01:30.177 --> 01:31.613

that he confessed.

01:31.656 --> 01:33.223
Should I tell her?

01:33.267 --> 01:34.790
- I would wait

01:34.833 --> 01:37.532
and let her tell us
what she knows first.

01:37.575 --> 01:39.577
All right.

01:43.451 --> 01:45.844
- Sorry to keep you waiting.

01:45.888 --> 01:47.759
- Nobody got you anything.

01:47.803 --> 01:50.675
You want a coffee or something?
- No, thank you.

01:52.286 --> 01:54.244
When can I see my son?

01:54.288 --> 01:56.768
- We can take you to the
foster home right after this.

01:58.814 --> 02:00.859
- It's just for now.

02:00.903 --> 02:03.123
It's temporary.

02:03.166 --> 02:06.343
- I'm sorry,
this is just...

02:06.387 --> 02:09.172
I'm very confused.

02:09.216 --> 02:11.609
What happened to Adam and Bess?

02:11.653 --> 02:14.482
- It looks like
they were poisoned.

02:15.613 --> 02:18.616
- I don't understand.
By someone?

02:18.660 --> 02:21.793
- We thought Adam and Bess
were Julian's parents.

02:21.837 --> 02:23.839
- No, they live on my property.

02:23.882 --> 02:26.798
When I need them to they look
after Julian sometimes.

02:26.842 --> 02:28.409
They were taking him
to Niagara Falls

02:28.452 --> 02:29.845
for the weekend.

02:29.888 --> 02:32.848
He and Bess love each other.

02:32.891 --> 02:35.807
What happened exactly?

02:35.851 --> 02:38.375
- Did you know they packed no
luggage for Julian?

02:38.419 --> 02:41.335
- Yes, they forgot his bag.

02:41.378 --> 02:44.338
Adam and Bess are lovely
but they're...

02:44.381 --> 02:45.817
they're absent-minded.

02:45.861 --> 02:47.471
I called them about it.

02:47.515 --> 02:48.646
We decided
that they'd pick up

02:48.690 --> 02:50.692
a few things for
him along the way.

02:52.868 --> 02:55.697
- All right, let's take a look.

02:58.265 --> 03:00.745
We'll find something
that fits in here.

03:10.015 --> 03:13.410
- This obviously isn't your
current address. Oregon?

03:13.454 --> 03:15.499
- No, I'm sorry.
I need to renew that.

03:15.543 --> 03:17.327
No, I live about 20 miles
from here.

03:19.329 --> 03:21.549
- Off of Route Four.

03:21.592 --> 03:23.725
- Near Osborn Road.

03:26.249 --> 03:27.903
I'd like to see him now.

03:29.600 --> 03:31.689
- Miss Walker,

03:31.733 --> 03:33.474
has Julian had any

03:33.517 --> 03:36.303
emotional issues
he's had to deal with?

03:37.304 --> 03:39.523
- No.
Why would you ask that?

03:39.567 --> 03:42.352
- Anxiety, depression--
- No.

03:42.396 --> 03:44.702
He's a happy child.

03:50.708 --> 03:53.972
- I think you should tell me
what happened.

03:55.322 --> 03:57.715
- We found the bodies
like this.

03:57.759 --> 03:59.543
The blankets.

03:59.587 --> 04:01.589
The positions.

04:10.337 --> 04:13.601
- There's no reason Julian
would do something like this.

04:15.385 --> 04:16.734
Something happened,
an accident.

04:16.778 --> 04:18.475
I don't know.
Something.

04:22.436 --> 04:24.438
He's a 13-year-old boy.

04:24.481 --> 04:25.874
- Miss Walker,

04:25.917 --> 04:28.268
he's told us already.

04:28.311 --> 04:29.704
He's confessed it.

04:31.793 --> 04:34.535
- To poisoning Mr. Lowry
and Ms. McTeer.

04:35.797 --> 04:38.408
- He made a tea from a plant.

04:38.452 --> 04:40.584
It's called Jimsonweed

04:40.628 --> 04:42.543
and he said he knew
it was poisonous.

04:42.586 --> 04:44.545
- We have corroborating
evidence.

04:44.588 --> 04:47.809
Fingerprints, video footage
from the motel.

04:49.637 --> 04:51.856
- I want to see him now.

04:53.858 --> 04:55.947
- So when she mentioned
where she lived

04:55.991 --> 04:58.080
it threw you off a little bit.

04:58.123 --> 05:01.388
Route Four, Osborn Road.

05:01.431 --> 05:03.433
- There's nothing
on Osborn Road

05:03.477 --> 05:04.956
except for this one place.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.481
At least 30 other people
live there.

05:07.524 --> 05:09.613
It was a retreat center
that went out of business

05:09.657 --> 05:11.789
in the '90s
and then these people

05:11.833 --> 05:13.443
bought it and tried
to turn it into

05:13.487 --> 05:15.619
some kind of utopian community

Adam woke up and he took me

yesterday that you made
two cups of tea

07:57.825 --> 08:00.131
Julian's legally
a ward of the state.

to prove guardianship

08:03.134 --> 08:05.006

until she proves
her guardianship at court,

08:42.870 --> 08:45.263
but she doesn't need
to know that yet.

08:46.656 --> 08:49.180
Gives us a window
of opportunity.

What are the charges
you're filing?

09:19.994 --> 09:22.649

09:22.692 --> 09:26.000
- As we mentioned,
we have a confession.

09:26.043 --> 09:28.611
- A confession you extracted
without a parent present,

09:28.655 --> 09:30.874
which I know for a fact is not
admissible in court.

09:30.918 --> 09:32.267
This entire case is bullshit.

09:32.310 --> 09:34.574

09:40.101 --> 09:43.713
- Why do you think Julian would
do something like this?

09:45.672 --> 09:48.588
- "He's crazy,"
is that what you're thinking?

09:48.631 --> 09:50.720
Or he's been abused.

09:50.764 --> 09:52.679
Or I pumped him
full of Adderall

09:52.722 --> 09:54.724
and fed him junk food
and video games.

09:54.768 --> 09:57.031
Or maybe he's just evil,
is that it?

09:59.294 --> 10:03.777
My son is so far beyond
anything you can understand.

10:03.820 --> 10:05.953
You have no idea.

10:21.098 --> 10:23.231
- Are you kidding--
Mosswood?

10:23.274 --> 10:25.102
- As far we know
that's where he grew up.

10:25.146 --> 10:26.364
- Jesus.

10:26.408 --> 10:28.323
Well, it makes sense.
I mean--

10:28.366 --> 10:30.978
those weirdos would turn out
a kid like that.

10:31.021 --> 10:33.589
- We're hoping to get
a search warrant

10:33.633 --> 10:36.331
and take a look
at his living situation.

10:38.028 --> 10:40.335
- Chief, young criminals
in most cases,

10:40.378 --> 10:42.946
the crime starts with
the parents

10:42.990 --> 10:45.122
and the mother is not
cooperating.

10:45.166 --> 10:46.820
And then this place,

10:46.863 --> 10:48.386
the whole question
about this commune--

10:51.607 --> 10:53.348
- No, not yet.

10:53.391 --> 10:55.176
- Well, why don't we start
with that?

10:55.219 --> 10:57.265
We have what we need, right?

10:57.308 --> 10:58.919
- Yeah, we do.

10:58.962 --> 11:01.095
- I still think
that we should go in there.

11:01.138 --> 11:02.923
- Detective, I understand
your desire,

11:02.966 --> 11:04.925
but that place is
a hornet's nest.

11:04.968 --> 11:07.623
Last time we went in there it
blew up in my face for nothing.

11:11.453 --> 11:13.498
- They want to be left alone,

11:13.542 --> 11:16.937
and frankly so do we.

11:18.155 --> 11:20.549
- That's--
- I'm not going down that road.

11:21.419 --> 11:23.247
- Um--
- Okay.

11:23.291 --> 11:25.249
Thank you, sir.

11:27.338 --> 11:29.950

it's something else.

11:29.993 --> 11:31.952
A classmate of Heather's,

11:31.995 --> 11:33.693
she got mixed up with them.

11:33.736 --> 11:36.260
She joined up or converted,

11:36.304 --> 11:37.914
whatever you call it.

11:37.958 --> 11:40.917
And we never heard
from her again.

11:44.660 --> 11:46.444
- And then there was
Kyle Cummings.

11:46.488 --> 11:50.100

high school quarterback

11:50.144 --> 11:51.667
out here at Keller.

11:51.711 --> 11:53.669
And he was seeing
a girl in there

11:53.713 --> 11:55.627
and he wound up in there
one night.

11:55.671 --> 11:59.283
And the next day
he hanged himself.

11:59.327 --> 12:02.199
Everybody was devastated.
Nobody saw it coming.

12:02.243 --> 12:03.679
He just wasn't the type.

12:03.723 --> 12:07.683
Good family, no drugs,

in here every weekend

12:10.120 --> 12:11.513

12:11.556 --> 12:14.472
- Dad, that's not
really the point.

12:14.516 --> 12:16.561
People were convinced
that Mosswood members

12:16.605 --> 12:18.259
had done something to him.

12:18.302 --> 12:21.436
Some local guys beat them up

12:21.479 --> 12:24.656
That kid's from Mosswood?

12:25.570 --> 12:27.442

we can't really talk about

14:38.399 --> 14:43.708
"Yes, master.
How may I service you, master."

14:43.752 --> 14:46.233
- Oh, God. That's so gross.

14:51.542 --> 14:53.196
Whatever they're doing
down there

14:53.240 --> 14:56.547
I bet it's way more interesting
than anything we do.

14:59.724 --> 15:02.597
- So let's go.

15:03.511 --> 15:05.600
- Let's sneak on.

15:07.819 --> 15:10.735
- Yeah, I'm dead serious.

15:10.779 --> 15:13.173
- Oh, my God.
I love you.

15:22.312 --> 15:26.186
- I wanted to hear
about life on the commune.

15:29.363 --> 15:30.886
An average day.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.627
What's that like?

15:33.671 --> 15:35.847
- There's really no such thing.

15:37.588 --> 15:40.417
- Well,
what time do you wake up?

15:40.461 --> 15:42.376
- When the sun rises.

15:44.160 --> 15:47.947
- Well, there's no sleeping
in for this guy, huh?

15:48.991 --> 15:51.515
- No, I sleep mostly inside.

15:51.559 --> 15:53.909
Sometimes I sleep outside
on warm nights.

15:55.258 --> 15:57.304
- Hmm.

16:00.176 --> 16:02.396
- Aren't you gonna ask me
about my mother?

16:02.439 --> 16:04.615
Isn't that why you're here?

16:05.529 --> 16:07.531
- All right.

16:07.575 --> 16:09.185
Um...

16:10.752 --> 16:12.972
Does she cook for you?

16:13.015 --> 16:15.539
Make you breakfast?

16:17.846 --> 16:19.717
- Sometimes.

16:26.246 --> 16:28.248

See if you can tell me anything
that might help your situation.

17:00.715 --> 17:02.978

- My mother can read minds.

17:09.419 --> 17:11.595
She told me all about you.

17:12.640 --> 17:15.425
- Did she tell you to change
your story?

Thank you.

19:26.426 --> 19:29.777
And proof of residence?
Where is that?

19:32.432 --> 19:34.956
I wasn't told to bring
proof of residence.

where the child lives,

19:36.914 --> 19:38.742
where he goes to school.

19:38.786 --> 19:40.918
- We live at 90 Osborn Road.
He was born there.

19:40.962 --> 19:42.398
He's lived there
his entire life.

19:42.442 --> 19:44.357

for school?

19:46.272 --> 19:48.187
- He's home schooled.

19:48.230 --> 19:49.971
- Well,
then you must be registered

19:50.014 --> 19:51.886
as a home school
in New York State.

19:51.929 --> 19:54.193
So where's that documentation?

19:54.236 --> 19:56.064
- I don't see why you need
that when you have

19:56.107 --> 19:57.805
his birth certificate.
No one told me I had to bring--

19:57.848 --> 19:59.937

required, Ms. Walker.

19:59.981 --> 20:02.244
Once you have the appropriate

And frankly,
I have more confidence

33:23.958 --> 33:25.916
Right this way, please.

33:40.670 --> 33:43.021
If you don't mind,
could you both wait

33:43.064 --> 33:44.935
by the door during
the search please?

33:47.112 --> 33:48.896
Thank you.

33:51.942 --> 33:54.032
Who's his roommate?
- I am.

33:55.511 --> 33:57.861
- No one on the Grove
has a private bedroom.

34:01.561 --> 34:03.519
- There are no other children.

34:03.563 --> 34:06.174
We focus our energy
into the work.

34:08.524 --> 34:10.570
- This Julian's duffel bag
for the trip?

34:10.613 --> 34:12.137
- It is.

34:12.180 --> 34:13.790
Please be careful.

34:19.622 --> 34:21.798
- He's not in the picture.

34:23.800 --> 34:27.108
- What about Danny Spalding
with the car?

34:27.152 --> 34:29.110
Is he still a resident here?

34:31.199 --> 34:34.420
- Well, he's an ex-convict.

34:34.463 --> 34:36.161
On the sex offender list.

34:36.204 --> 34:37.988
And he's living with a minor,

34:38.032 --> 34:41.688
so I think that's
a reasonable thing to ask.

34:41.731 --> 34:44.125
- Mosswood is
a sanctuary community.

34:44.169 --> 34:47.085
We don't turn anyone away.

34:47.128 --> 34:49.130
Anyone who abides
by our rules can stay

34:49.174 --> 34:50.958
no questions asked.

about that kind of thing.

34:56.529 --> 34:58.487
Are you concerned?

34:58.531 --> 35:00.141
- Danny's completely

35:00.185 --> 35:02.883
transformed himself
through the work.

35:02.926 --> 35:05.146
Society would cast him aside.

35:05.190 --> 35:06.887
We prefer to help him.

35:07.975 --> 35:10.108
People deserve a second chance.

35:15.504 --> 35:17.463
- Will we get
to see that area?

35:17.506 --> 35:19.900
What is it by the way?
- It's our garden.

35:19.943 --> 35:21.902
- You support yourselves
with that?

35:21.945 --> 35:24.165
- We grow most of what we need.

35:33.305 --> 35:36.830
- My mom, she's,
I don't know.

35:36.873 --> 35:39.789
She had me when
she was way too young

35:39.833 --> 35:41.574
and she's just annoyed,

35:41.617 --> 35:45.186
like, my entire existence
is a giant cock block to her.

35:53.803 --> 35:55.936

I want you to meet.

Sure.

36:04.249 --> 36:06.860

36:06.903 --> 36:09.036
- Just give me a minute.

36:13.301 --> 36:15.173
- Marin.

36:42.069 --> 36:44.854

Bess and Adam slept.

37:13.883 --> 37:15.885

37:40.997 --> 37:43.086
She gave it to me.

37:58.972 --> 38:01.191
- Before she left.
- Oh.

38:01.235 --> 38:03.368
It's a special gift.
