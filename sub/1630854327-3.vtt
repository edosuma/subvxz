on Neuroscience.

Miami is a six-hour flight
from Seattle.

all of Saturday,

in time to pick up Scout.

A little.

to psychosomatic therapy.

about medicine,

I supposed to do?

a "hysterical paroxysm"...

to tell Bailey no?

with a sex-ed curriculum

02:58.246 --> 03:00.047
to teach teenagers
about their bodies

you don't have to carry
an unwanted pregnancy

statistically speaking,

with that.

27:09.128 --> 27:10.963
Oh, yeah, she's okay.
She's in there with Amelia.

27:10.997 --> 27:12.631
Okay. I thought she may have had
another panic attack.
No, no.

27:12.665 --> 27:15.467
But she did find
some of Kai's puzzles

27:15.501 --> 27:17.636
that they use for
neurological evaluations.

27:17.670 --> 27:20.439
The puzzles mainly focus
on visual-spatial skills.

27:20.472 --> 27:23.275
Yeah, I'm familiar with them.
What -- What's going on?

27:23.309 --> 27:25.277
Meredith, she's aced
every single one

27:25.311 --> 27:27.379
at a level far higher
than most of the adults I see.

27:27.413 --> 27:29.281
I'm aware
that she's smart.

27:29.315 --> 27:31.650
My question is, why is she being
evaluated without my consent?

27:31.684 --> 27:34.620
Right, well, it --
Yeah, it was an accident.

27:34.653 --> 27:36.388
Zola discovered the test
when she and I

27:36.422 --> 27:38.457
were in there practicing
on the simulators.

27:38.490 --> 27:40.126
She's supposed to be
in my office doing homework.

27:40.159 --> 27:42.228
Mer, based on Kai's time
with her,

27:42.261 --> 27:44.997
Zola is
extremely gifted,

27:45.031 --> 27:46.565
which could explain
the panic attacks.

27:46.598 --> 27:48.400
When giftedness
is undiagnosed,

27:48.434 --> 27:50.402
it can contribute
to behavioral issues --

27:50.436 --> 27:53.039
anxiety, a feeling
of being untethered,

27:53.072 --> 27:55.574
a feeling
that you don't belong.

27:55.607 --> 27:58.244
Because you don't.
Her brain does not function
like other kids her age.

27:58.277 --> 27:59.712
She needs challenges
that they don't.

27:59.746 --> 28:02.081
She needs to be around peers
who can relate to her

28:02.114 --> 28:03.349
and the way she thinks.

28:05.284 --> 28:06.352
I'm gonna go see my kid.

28:11.590 --> 28:14.593
Penetration is not necessary
for mutual pleasure.

28:14.626 --> 28:17.229
For starters, most women,
or people with vaginas,

28:17.263 --> 28:20.099
can't achieve orgasm
through penetration.

28:21.467 --> 28:23.235
Yes?
How come
that's not in porn?

28:23.269 --> 28:26.672
Because porn is to actual
human sex

28:26.705 --> 28:29.876
as the "Fast & Furious"
is to actual human driving.

28:29.909 --> 28:32.444
That is to say,
it bears no resemblance.

28:32.478 --> 28:34.080
If you are having sex
with your partner,

28:34.113 --> 28:36.248
and you are trying
to make it look like porn,

28:36.282 --> 28:39.718
your partner is experiencing
little to no pleasure.

28:39.752 --> 28:41.520
I would disagree.

28:41.553 --> 28:43.555
Well, you would disagree because
the girls you are with

28:43.589 --> 28:45.591
are also making it look
and sound like porn.

28:45.624 --> 28:47.426
But that is just an act.

28:47.459 --> 28:50.262

a real orgasm.

36:23.515 --> 36:24.650
What helped?

36:24.683 --> 36:27.886
A kind child psychiatrist

36:27.919 --> 36:30.422
who gave me tools
that helped along the way.

36:30.456 --> 36:33.225
Zola will get
her tools.

36:33.259 --> 36:35.227
* Hide it

36:35.261 --> 36:37.496
We'll make sure of it.

36:37.529 --> 36:39.765
* So I will love you
from the outside *

are telling you *

come on over.

way too much food.

36:51.610 --> 36:55.213
Oh, I really should
keep working.

Addie, you're gonna
run yourself ragged

36:57.483 --> 37:00.185
trying to solve the world's
problems every waking hour.

what they're continuing
to do,

37:10.762 --> 37:13.465
it just...

37:13.499 --> 37:15.534

And I also know that
even if you spend every day

So, how long are you gonna
stay mad at me?

37:49.134 --> 37:51.236

What do you think?

37:51.269 --> 37:52.671
Let me know.

I haven't decided yet.
Okay.

[ Chuckles ]

37:58.009 --> 38:00.111
I mean, I'm lost with Zola
right now.

38:00.145 --> 38:03.081
And it just doesn't help
that all the people I love

38:03.114 --> 38:06.151
go behind my back
and break all of my rules.

38:06.184 --> 38:07.586

38:07.619 --> 38:09.521
She is.
And she's brilliant.

to figure out here.

But, uh, we got a big piece
of the puzzle.

38:13.659 --> 38:15.361
I mean, it's got to feel
pretty good, doesn't it?

38:15.394 --> 38:17.996
Yeah, it does.

38:18.029 --> 38:19.798
Ah!
Did I get a smile?

38:19.831 --> 38:22.133

Okay.

38:52.498 --> 38:55.801
* Over you and I
Yeah.

38:55.834 --> 38:58.169
We know it reduces stress and
strengthens the immune system.

38:58.203 --> 39:01.206
* It kept coming in waves

39:01.239 --> 39:03.709
* Till we were paralyzed

super sexy?

being written? *
