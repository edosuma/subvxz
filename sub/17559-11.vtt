00:42.041 --> 00:44.502
Henry and I are so good
together when we're alone

00:44.586 --> 00:47.922
but when Vince is around,
it's really weird.

00:48.006 --> 00:49.966
I thought that you were
definitely going to Princeton.

00:50.049 --> 00:51.593
I don't wanna be away from you.

00:51.676 --> 00:53.636
You can crash with me
until you find something.

00:53.720 --> 00:55.847
No, he can't.

00:55.930 --> 00:58.224
Uh, Henry, Vince,
Henry, Vince, aah!

00:58.308 --> 00:59.309
Help me fix it.

00:59.392 --> 01:02.187
Okay, calm down.
Listen to me, okay?

01:02.270 --> 01:04.105
Unfortunately, you're gonna
have to make a decision.

01:04.188 --> 01:06.024
I mean, you cannot keep
stringing Henry along

01:06.107 --> 01:09.068
if you're having these feelings
for Vince. It's just not fair.

01:09.152 --> 01:10.695
What?

01:21.331 --> 01:24.125
Henry's still not picking up.
Oh, my God, he must hate me.

01:24.209 --> 01:25.502
Look, I am so sorry.

01:25.585 --> 01:27.378
I never would have said
anything about Vince

01:27.462 --> 01:29.005
if I'd known Henry
was standing right there.

01:29.088 --> 01:32.133
I know. Stop apologizing, okay?
It's not your fault.

01:32.217 --> 01:35.261
Hmm, aren't you forgiving?

01:35.345 --> 01:38.097
- What?
- Okay, let's be honest.

01:38.181 --> 01:40.642
You did open up
your big pie hole.

01:40.725 --> 01:43.978
Lauren, it's not her fault.

01:44.062 --> 01:47.482
Even though she knows Henry
always hangs out at the diner.

01:47.565 --> 01:48.900
Yeah, well, Holly's right.

01:48.983 --> 01:50.568
Yeah, I should have
known better.

01:50.652 --> 01:53.863
Even though Holly did choose to
have a very private conversation

01:53.947 --> 01:56.282
in a very public place.

01:56.366 --> 01:58.034
- That is true.
- Yeah, true.

01:58.117 --> 01:59.869
It's my fault.

01:59.953 --> 02:01.371
Even though it's a conversation

02:01.454 --> 02:02.747
that should have been
in hushed tones

02:02.831 --> 02:04.541
and Val was belting out
her advice

02:04.624 --> 02:07.293
like it was open mike night.

02:07.377 --> 02:08.877
Your voice does carry

02:08.961 --> 02:13.383
which is understandable
to overpower your high squeaks.

02:13.466 --> 02:15.093
Yeah, it's like
the two of you together

02:15.176 --> 02:16.386

Ugh, I'm surprised there was
anyone left in that diner.

02:24.727 --> 02:27.105
You know what,
I don't wanna get involved.

02:27.188 --> 02:28.565
You know, I'm just gonna
call Gary again.

02:28.648 --> 02:30.149
Or should I say..

02:30.233 --> 02:32.819
[high-pitched tone]
...I'm gonna call Gary again.

02:32.902 --> 02:35.572
[loudly]
Good idea, Holly.

02:35.655 --> 02:36.906
Hello?

02:36.990 --> 02:38.658
Hey, did you find him yet?
Did you find him?

02:38.741 --> 02:42.579
No, I went to Washington
Square Park, Chelsea Piers.

02:42.662 --> 02:45.540
I even went by his parents'
apartment. Nothing.

02:45.623 --> 02:47.584
Okay, will you call me
as soon as you find him?

02:47.667 --> 02:49.752
As soon as I find him.

02:54.007 --> 02:56.259
So how you doing?

02:56.342 --> 02:58.052
I just..

02:58.136 --> 03:01.097
I think I'd feel a lot better
if I just talked about it.

03:01.180 --> 03:05.059
- Do you mind?
- No. Go ahead, man. Let it out.

03:16.112 --> 03:18.072
I hear you, man.

03:24.329 --> 03:26.623
- Anything?
- No, he's still not answering.

03:26.706 --> 03:28.791
Okay, I don't wanna
be insensitive here

03:28.875 --> 03:31.085
but I'm getting a little bored.

03:34.380 --> 03:35.798
Okay.

03:35.882 --> 03:38.134
He wasn't at Disc-O-Rama,
he wasn't at Astor Place

03:38.217 --> 03:39.302
and he wasn't at Reminiscence

03:39.385 --> 03:42.055
but how cute is this skirt?

03:45.099 --> 03:47.518
- Okay, I have to get going.
- But where are you going?

03:47.602 --> 03:49.020
I can't sit around here anymore.

03:49.103 --> 03:50.480
I have to go find my boyfriend.

03:50.563 --> 03:53.358
- Vince or Henry?
- Henry, Henry, Henry!

03:53.441 --> 03:55.485
You can say it all you want,
you still like Vince.

03:55.568 --> 03:57.987
Okay, you know what,
this is not about Vince.

03:58.071 --> 04:00.698
This is about Henry.
Henry is my boyfriend.

04:00.782 --> 04:02.492
Again, I don't
wanna get involved

04:02.575 --> 04:06.204
but skinny is your boyfriend,
you got a crush on gorgeous.

04:06.287 --> 04:10.416
If you ask me, Pie Hole
over here did you a favor.

04:10.500 --> 04:13.378
I think what None Of Your
Business is trying to say

04:13.461 --> 04:16.505
is that it's better to have
everything out in the open.

04:16.589 --> 04:18.423
Yeah, you have to
decide what you want.

04:18.507 --> 04:20.009
I know what I want,
I want everything

04:20.093 --> 04:21.135
to go back to the way it was.

04:21.219 --> 04:22.512
When?

04:22.595 --> 04:25.473
When everything was great
between me and Henry.

04:25.556 --> 04:26.808
- I have to go.
- No, wait.

04:26.891 --> 04:28.851
I-it's almost 11 o'clock,
I am not gonna

04:28.935 --> 04:30.311
let you just run around
in the middle of the night.

04:30.395 --> 04:31.938
Okay, Val,
give me my jacket back.

04:32.021 --> 04:33.356
No, unh-unh, anything
you have to say to him

04:33.439 --> 04:34.399
you can say it tomorrow.

04:34.482 --> 04:35.483
- Give it!
- No!

04:35.566 --> 04:36.734
- Val!
- You're very upset.

04:36.818 --> 04:38.695
He's very upset
and-and I am just gonna

04:38.778 --> 04:40.029
have to insist
that you don't go.

04:40.113 --> 04:42.657
Give it. Val, I am not
seven years old anymore.

04:42.740 --> 04:44.450
I swear to God,
I can take you down.

04:44.534 --> 04:47.161
- Oh, yeah? Bring it.
- Okay.

04:47.245 --> 04:49.038
Oh. I got 20 bucks on Holly.

04:49.122 --> 04:51.708
I don't know.
I think Val's a biter.

04:51.791 --> 04:54.377
You know what sucks about you?
You think you know everything.

04:54.460 --> 04:56.879
I don't think.
I know, I know everything.

04:56.963 --> 05:00.049
Just like I know you are not
goin' anywhere tonight.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.051
Huh? Well, you know what
you don't know.

05:02.135 --> 05:06.472
You don't know that I know
where you hide your car keys.

05:06.556 --> 05:09.392
- Hey!
- Bye.

05:09.475 --> 05:12.603

and Val's coat.

05:12.687 --> 05:15.231

here for two hours

05:46.137 --> 05:48.139
Man, you killed Ant-tonio.

05:57.857 --> 05:59.942
She wouldn't listen to me. She
wouldn't listen to my advice.

06:00.026 --> 06:01.903
Well, you know
what's gonna happen.

06:01.986 --> 06:05.239

06:12.705 --> 06:14.624
Ooh.

06:14.707 --> 06:17.293
I'll tell you exactly
what is gonna happen.

06:17.376 --> 06:19.087
Holly is gonna go talk to Henry.

06:19.170 --> 06:20.797
He's gonna say things
out of anger.

06:20.880 --> 06:22.131
They're gonna hurt
each other's feelings

06:22.215 --> 06:23.508
and she is gonna
be shattered.

06:23.591 --> 06:24.967
And you know who
she's gonna come running to

06:25.051 --> 06:26.052
to pick up the pieces?

06:26.135 --> 06:29.639
- Me.
- No, me.

06:29.722 --> 06:31.599
I am gonna have to put
everything back together again

06:31.682 --> 06:33.309
because that is what I do.

06:33.392 --> 06:36.562
But not this time.
She is on her own.

06:36.646 --> 06:38.231
She thinks she can handle
everything on her own?

06:38.314 --> 06:39.857
Well, fine, let her handle
this on her own.

06:39.941 --> 06:41.526
Because quite honestly,
this whole thing is starting

06:41.609 --> 06:43.611
to really cheese me off.

06:44.904 --> 06:46.614
- Hey, Val.
- What?

06:46.697 --> 06:48.825
Wanna see something
really gross?

06:48.908 --> 06:51.285
Quit it.

06:51.369 --> 06:53.496
You know what? I'm sorry.
That was really cold.

06:53.579 --> 06:54.956
Thank you.

come home?

07:11.931 --> 07:13.641
Well, we've lived together
for a day.

So far, he gets home
after midnight.

know that I'm here to see Henry.

know me. Henry knows me.

anything off.

- Okay, fine.
- Sorry.

It's just Henry and I had
a thing and it's gonna be fine.

- What kind of thing?

- Oh, you were worried about me?

Yes.

can we go outside and talk?

08:19.665 --> 08:22.084
Good luck with that.

you do, bro.

with an open mind.

tell you how he feels--

- Why don't you tell him, Holly?

and break the news.

totally screwed.

works out okay with that.

something else?

Well, I am no longer in the

It's a brown leather band
with Holly's initials on it.

don't even know why I want it.

you to the Strokes rehearsal

15:18.584 --> 15:21.670
and you lied to me about it?

you made for me.

with your initials on it.

15:37.269 --> 15:39.605
Remember when we gave
these to each other?

15:39.688 --> 15:42.858
Remember, I gave you yours
and I told you I loved you

15:42.941 --> 15:45.861

and you said you loved me.

of not caring about you.
