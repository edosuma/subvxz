get to see each other climb

10:16.515 --> 10:19.768

10:22.355 --> 10:26.408
going into your first climb
here in Siurana.

10:26.492 --> 10:28.160
- Yeah, I just wanted to say

10:28.260 --> 10:30.178
it's really special that we're all here.

10:30.262 --> 10:33.199
Of, like, what I've put into my life,

10:33.299 --> 10:35.017
you know, it makes it all
more meaningful.

10:35.101 --> 10:36.502
- And with that,

10:36.602 --> 10:39.672
we will kick off movie night with Mario.

10:39.772 --> 10:43.042
Please come to
the front and center stage.

10:43.142 --> 10:47.380
Take us through your climb
in your awesome Texas pants.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.264
[laughter]

10:49.348 --> 10:52.100
- Calm down, calm down.
- We can't.

10:52.184 --> 10:54.036
- To be bluntly honest,
I actually was feeling

10:54.120 --> 10:56.038
really, like, a whole lot of self-doubt

10:56.122 --> 10:58.557
and I felt super uncomfortable.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.208
And I honestly was, like,
telling myself...

11:00.292 --> 11:02.561
I was like,
"Why the fuck am I even here?"

11:02.662 --> 11:04.646
This... when I bumped here, I came off,

11:04.730 --> 11:06.214
I felt like I was climbing fast

11:06.298 --> 11:08.034
and I wasn't patient with myself.

11:08.134 --> 11:09.551
And it's funny.
The moment I hit the water,

11:09.635 --> 11:11.153
I literally heard myself

11:11.237 --> 11:12.588
say the same thing
to the kids that I coach.

11:12.672 --> 11:14.556
I'm like, "If you're not
patient with yourself,

11:14.640 --> 11:15.724
"you're not kind to yourself

11:15.808 --> 11:16.725
"and if you're not kind yourself,

11:16.809 --> 11:17.759
you'll never send."

11:17.843 --> 11:20.295
My main gig is coaching kids.

11:20.379 --> 11:23.966
<i>That's what I love to do. It's my desire.</i>

11:24.050 --> 11:26.668

11:26.752 --> 11:30.256
<i>And if you get lazy,
if you get off your game,</i>

11:30.356 --> 11:32.224
<i>they will call you on your bullshit.</i>

11:32.324 --> 11:34.977
<i>And so to my kids that I coach,</i>

11:35.061 --> 11:36.345
<i>I want to prove to them</i>

11:36.429 --> 11:38.413
<i>that I am someone who does not back down</i>

11:38.497 --> 11:40.649
<i>and does not give up 'cause
I tell them the same thing.</i>

11:40.733 --> 11:43.018
<i>I need to heed that own advice.</i>

11:43.102 --> 11:44.403
That was my deal.

11:44.503 --> 11:46.088
But other than that,
the climb was fuckin' badass.

11:46.172 --> 11:47.422
[laughter]
- Thank you for sharing.

11:47.506 --> 11:48.857
[applause]
- Speech!

11:48.941 --> 11:50.659
- Thanks.
- Thank you for coming.

11:50.743 --> 11:52.578
- And now Maiza.

11:52.678 --> 11:54.329
- Maiza!
- Maiza!

11:54.413 --> 11:55.581
- It's your turn.

11:55.681 --> 11:58.333
Come on down.
- Girl.

11:58.417 --> 12:00.035
- Usually, when I climb
in front of people,

12:00.119 --> 12:03.372
I get really shaky
and I was scared of that.

12:03.456 --> 12:05.440
And I had never had
an experience climbing

12:05.524 --> 12:07.259
or in competition or anything.

12:07.359 --> 12:10.212
<i>I missed being in
the bottom two last week.</i>

12:10.296 --> 12:12.347
And I was terrified of being, like,

12:12.431 --> 12:13.882
the first person sent home.

12:13.966 --> 12:16.852
So there is a little bit of relief,

12:16.936 --> 12:18.104
but at the same time,

12:18.204 --> 12:20.606
everything happens all over again,

12:20.706 --> 12:23.025
so there is a lot of anxiety.

12:23.109 --> 12:25.894
I was in a very hard space mentally.

12:25.978 --> 12:28.130
I don't know if it's fear of
failing in front of people

12:28.214 --> 12:30.365
or just failing for myself.

12:30.449 --> 12:33.702
But I'm like, "There's no room
to struggle mentally here.

12:33.786 --> 12:36.738
Like, you just gotta do
your very, very best."

12:36.822 --> 12:38.958
So I just kind of went for it, but I...

12:39.058 --> 12:41.627
my body didn't feel like
good positioning,

12:41.727 --> 12:43.211
so obviously, I peeled off.

12:43.295 --> 12:44.980
Came in like a wrecking ball, yep.

12:45.064 --> 12:47.333
- [laughs] Wrecking ball.

12:47.433 --> 12:49.751
- Nice, Maiza.
- Yeah!

12:49.835 --> 12:51.753
- All right. Deco.

12:51.837 --> 12:54.840
- I had a completely different
mindset than everybody here

12:54.940 --> 12:56.324
'cause I've done a little bit of, like,

12:56.408 --> 12:57.559
deep water soloing back home.

12:57.643 --> 12:59.561
So I did kind of have a strategy.

12:59.645 --> 13:02.181
If I feel uncomfortable
and I... I'm past the point

13:02.281 --> 13:04.032
that I'm not gonna be
on the elimination climb,

13:04.116 --> 13:05.867
I'm just gonna cliff jump, you know.

13:05.951 --> 13:07.235
- But, dude, like,

13:07.319 --> 13:09.004
obviously, you gave up
right there, you know?

13:09.088 --> 13:10.372
- Oh yeah, yeah, I'm not...

13:10.456 --> 13:12.841
I'm not ashamed of it at all,
you know? I was like...

13:12.925 --> 13:15.161
- Not even a little bit?
- Nah.

13:15.261 --> 13:17.412
I mean, the first week
was pretty intense.

13:17.496 --> 13:18.880
You know, it was pretty stressful.

13:18.964 --> 13:20.248
- The moment you had, like,

13:20.332 --> 13:22.517
a little bit of uncertainty,
you were just like,

13:22.601 --> 13:23.869
"I'm out of here."
- Yes.

13:23.969 --> 13:25.954
- That's the part where, like,
man, we kind of, like,

13:26.038 --> 13:27.856
lost a little bit of respect
in that moment.

13:27.940 --> 13:30.843
Like, this is a golden opportunity.

13:30.943 --> 13:33.212
- I knew that I could and I bailed.

13:33.312 --> 13:35.964
<i>- I think Deco, by bailing on the climb,</i>

13:36.048 --> 13:37.799
he missed the point of competing.

13:37.883 --> 13:39.968
Like, in competing, you don't bail.

13:40.052 --> 13:41.937
That's not even something you fathom.

13:42.021 --> 13:44.857
Like, it's just like,
"You don't do that. You go.

13:44.957 --> 13:46.942
You go until you can't go
and then you fall."

13:47.026 --> 13:52.481
- Some of us, we're trying
so, so, so, so hard.

13:52.565 --> 13:54.700
We wanted to see you push for that too.

13:54.800 --> 13:56.735
- Deco, if I can... I'll be quick,

13:56.836 --> 13:58.487
but this is a competition

13:58.571 --> 14:00.122
and if you have the ability to win,

14:00.206 --> 14:02.741
and you obviously do, then you
need to take it

14:02.842 --> 14:04.626
because goddammit,
if you can send the route,

14:04.710 --> 14:05.827
you fucking send.

14:05.911 --> 14:07.562
