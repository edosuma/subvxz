WEBVTT

00:05.672 --> 00:06.673
Oh, good morning, George.

00:06.715 --> 00:09.926
I've never seen you looking better.

00:09.968 --> 00:12.012
Wait till I turn around.

00:12.053 --> 00:13.722
How do I look now?
- Well...

00:13.763 --> 00:15.724
you look better
than you looked before.

00:15.765 --> 00:18.393
Well, I'm surprised,
because before you really saw

00:18.435 --> 00:19.644
my best side.

00:19.686 --> 00:21.813
Oh.

00:21.855 --> 00:24.065
Hasn't the boss
a great sense of humor?

00:24.107 --> 00:25.400
Just the greatest.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.611
Very funny, Ronnie.

00:28.653 --> 00:33.116
George, look
at how wonderful you look.

00:34.701 --> 00:36.536
Holy shit.

00:36.578 --> 00:38.705
What the fuck
are you doing here?

00:38.747 --> 00:40.540
I'm being framed
by the same person

00:40.582 --> 00:43.626
who blackmailed you...

00:43.668 --> 00:45.128
Joyce's old assistant.

00:45.170 --> 00:46.296
How did you get in here?

00:46.337 --> 00:48.715
He's planning to release
footage to Deadline

00:48.757 --> 00:51.301
of Joyce saying you raped her.

00:51.342 --> 00:53.803
Get the fuck out of my house.

00:53.845 --> 00:55.263
Please.

00:55.305 --> 00:57.766
He's trying to destroy you...

00:57.807 --> 00:58.933
destroy the studio.

00:58.975 --> 01:01.394
You know how many times
little twats like him

01:01.436 --> 01:04.731
have tried to destroy me?

01:06.566 --> 01:09.069
My lawyer's will crush him.

01:09.110 --> 01:12.906
I need you to protect me.

01:12.947 --> 01:15.784
Tell Joyce I didn't do
anything wrong.

01:15.825 --> 01:18.620
Why would I do that?

01:21.623 --> 01:25.418
Maybe I could do something
for you.

01:25.460 --> 01:27.420
Oh, God.

01:27.462 --> 01:29.547
You and Joyce...

01:29.589 --> 01:32.634
the two of you are cut
from the same cloth.

01:35.678 --> 01:37.722
Fucking me
was how she came to be.

01:37.764 --> 01:39.599
- You raped her.
- She raped me.

01:39.641 --> 01:41.309
You're disgusting!

01:41.351 --> 01:42.936
Don't talk about her like that.

01:42.977 --> 01:45.730
I can't be all
that disgusting.

01:45.772 --> 01:48.108
You just offered
to suck my cock.

01:51.402 --> 01:52.737
So suck it...

01:52.779 --> 01:56.449
and get the fuck out of here
before I call the cops.

02:04.415 --> 02:07.627
What do you think you're going
to do with that, little girl?

02:10.130 --> 02:12.006
And you might give me
a substantial--

03:45.767 --> 03:47.602
You have any idea?

03:47.644 --> 03:49.062
You were fucking her.

03:49.103 --> 03:50.647
What do you think?
- Hey.

03:50.688 --> 03:52.232
I never touched her.

03:52.273 --> 03:55.068
Just need to get through
this next week,

03:55.109 --> 03:56.694
handle the media onslaught.

03:56.736 --> 03:58.780
I'll take care of it.

04:13.086 --> 04:16.506
Can you tell when was
the last time you saw her?

04:16.547 --> 04:20.301
Yesterday at the office.

04:20.343 --> 04:23.179
You obviously stand
to gain a lot

04:23.221 --> 04:25.098
from Mr. Isaacson's death.

04:25.139 --> 04:27.267
You ever talk with her
about that?

04:27.308 --> 04:29.727
Absolutely not.

04:31.062 --> 04:34.065
What was her relationship
with Mr. Isaacson?

04:36.150 --> 04:37.110
I have no idea.

04:37.151 --> 04:38.861
An assistant going
the extra mile?

04:38.903 --> 04:41.114
We ask a lot
of our staff here.

04:41.155 --> 04:43.157
Murder's not on the list.

04:44.909 --> 04:46.911
Were you two close?

04:48.746 --> 04:52.792
From what I understand,
the girl had emotional issues

04:52.834 --> 04:55.086
predating her time at Fountain.

04:56.713 --> 05:00.258
We're gonna need access
to your staff.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.843
Of course.

05:03.845 --> 05:06.389
How far along are you?

05:06.431 --> 05:09.100
Almost six months.
You?

05:09.142 --> 05:11.811
Three and a half.

05:11.853 --> 05:14.147
You didn't answer
my question.

05:16.607 --> 05:18.609
I'm sorry?

05:18.651 --> 05:21.237
Were you and Ms. Simms close?

06:32.850 --> 06:34.811
Promise?

07:28.448 --> 07:29.949
Beachcomber found it.

07:31.534 --> 07:34.912
He likes to go out after a
storm, see what washes ashore.

07:34.954 --> 07:36.330
What about the girl?

07:36.372 --> 07:38.124
Ah, nothing yet.

07:38.166 --> 07:39.167
With those tides,

07:39.208 --> 07:42.253
her body is probably halfway
to Mexico.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.005
You think she's dead?

07:44.046 --> 07:46.549
You know how many drownings
we have out here?

07:46.591 --> 07:48.801
And that's on sunny, calm days.

07:48.843 --> 07:50.136
She would've been fucking nuts

07:50.178 --> 07:53.473
to go out in that storm
last night.

07:53.514 --> 07:55.308
She's killed two people.

07:55.349 --> 07:57.018
I think we've established that.

08:01.772 --> 08:04.650
The search continues
for 22-year-old Lou Simms,

08:04.692 --> 08:06.652
suspected of murdering
Fountain Picture's

08:06.694 --> 08:08.112
Redmond Isaacson.

08:08.154 --> 08:09.322
both: Presumed dead,

08:09.363 --> 08:11.532
Simms also goes
by the name April Mace.

08:11.574 --> 08:13.743
Isaacson was
brutally murdered

08:13.784 --> 08:15.786
in his Holmby Hills estate
in April.

08:15.828 --> 08:17.872
The suspect is considered
armed and dangerous.

08:45.066 --> 08:47.235
I texted Emilie to get us
options for the premiere

08:47.276 --> 08:49.153
Thursday night.

08:49.195 --> 08:51.531
What do you want to wear?

08:51.572 --> 08:53.282
You choose.

08:56.202 --> 08:57.703
I want to fuck tonight.

08:57.745 --> 09:00.206
♪ And you walk so slowly ♪

09:02.291 --> 09:05.002
You think that's funny?

09:05.044 --> 09:06.712
I think that's cute.

09:06.754 --> 09:09.924
I wasn't going for cute.

09:09.966 --> 09:10.967
Really?

09:12.760 --> 09:14.720
- Really.
- Mm.

09:14.762 --> 09:18.599
♪ You're a slow
death engine ♪

09:18.641 --> 09:22.144
♪ Running on a suicide ♪

09:59.807 --> 10:02.018
I see you.

10:17.325 --> 10:18.409
Hey, what's up?

10:18.451 --> 10:21.037
Print looks great.
Meredith's really happy.

10:21.078 --> 10:23.497
that's a first.

10:23.539 --> 10:25.041
You nervous?

10:25.082 --> 10:27.209
Never.

10:27.251 --> 10:29.587
Hey, Marty.

10:30.504 --> 10:33.382
Thank you...

10:33.424 --> 10:35.176
for standing by me
all these years.

10:35.217 --> 10:37.345
I really appreciate
your loyalty.

10:37.386 --> 10:40.222
Yeah, of course.
I'll see you soon.

10:40.264 --> 10:41.891
All right, see you later.

11:07.458 --> 11:08.876
Ready?

11:11.796 --> 11:13.923
Ready.

13:13.667 --> 13:17.630
Hello, everybody.
This is Mrs. Norman Maine.

14:23.946 --> 14:25.948
Is that her?

14:32.121 --> 14:34.540
That should be you
down there.

15:06.113 --> 15:08.282
Hey.

15:08.324 --> 15:10.826
Hi. You want to go outside?

15:10.868 --> 15:13.203
Huh? Good boy, come here.

15:14.747 --> 15:17.082
Somebody's got to go pee.
I'll be right back, baby.

15:17.124 --> 15:18.626
Okay, honey.

15:35.059 --> 15:37.645
You look so beautiful pregnant.

15:44.109 --> 15:46.946
What are you doing here?

15:46.987 --> 15:49.657
Well, I had
to be there tonight.

15:53.118 --> 15:54.703
The movie...

15:54.745 --> 15:57.623
it was everything
we hoped it'd be.

15:57.665 --> 16:01.085
- How'd you get into my house?
- Oh, I've been here before.

16:02.169 --> 16:06.632
Miles wasn't very discreet
about the hidden key.

16:08.884 --> 16:12.137
Don't worry.
I wouldn't let him touch me.

16:12.179 --> 16:15.474
I may be the only girl in town
with that distinction.

16:18.352 --> 16:19.812
Sit, sit, sit.

16:19.853 --> 16:21.939
You shouldn't be standing
in your condition.

16:21.981 --> 16:24.858
Please, please. Okay.

16:33.158 --> 16:35.411
What do you want from me, Lou?

16:38.330 --> 16:40.708
I guess I'm confused.

16:43.419 --> 16:45.587
I need clarity.

16:45.629 --> 16:48.173
I did everything for you.

16:50.175 --> 16:52.219
Hooked up with Meredith
so you could get your books,

16:52.261 --> 16:54.763
gave you the only thing
you wanted more than anything,

16:54.805 --> 16:57.516
eliminated the man
who raped you--

16:57.558 --> 17:00.561
the only one left
who could take it all away.

17:08.902 --> 17:13.157
And you repay me
by getting rid of me?

17:13.198 --> 17:17.202
Walking around with that piece
of shit on your arm

17:17.244 --> 17:18.996
at our movie premiere?
- Listen to me.

17:19.038 --> 17:21.123
Saying in the press

17:21.165 --> 17:24.710
that you didn't know me?

17:28.172 --> 17:30.799
Didn't...

17:30.841 --> 17:32.051
know me?

17:32.092 --> 17:36.221
- Listen to me.
- I did everything...

17:36.263 --> 17:37.473
for you.

17:42.311 --> 17:44.354
Speak of the devil.

17:45.814 --> 17:48.067
Oh, hey, little man.

17:51.278 --> 17:52.488
Hi, Miles.

17:52.529 --> 17:54.156
- Did you let her in?
- No.

17:54.198 --> 17:55.866
Get the fuck
out of our house.

17:55.908 --> 17:58.243
Last time I was here
you wanted me to come.

18:00.329 --> 18:02.915
And I love how you say
"our house"...

18:02.956 --> 18:05.542
like your shitty art paid
for any of this.

18:05.584 --> 18:06.710
Fuck you.

18:06.752 --> 18:08.253
I'm calling the police.

18:08.295 --> 18:10.714
You really want the mother
of your child

18:10.756 --> 18:13.592
spending the rest
of her life in jail?

18:16.178 --> 18:19.348
I wonder if the baby
will look more like me...

18:19.389 --> 18:21.642
or Miles.

18:22.559 --> 18:27.272
Let's hope for her sake, me.
- Please tell me you didn't.

18:30.526 --> 18:32.528
When were you gonna
tell him, Joyce?

18:32.569 --> 18:34.696
No, no, no, no, no.
What the fuck, huh?

18:34.738 --> 18:36.115
I couldn't do it
with a stranger.

18:36.156 --> 18:37.324
So you did it with her?

18:37.366 --> 18:38.867
Please, you wouldn't have
been my first choice either.

18:38.909 --> 18:40.702
Are--are--are you stupid?
Are you fucking insane?

18:40.744 --> 18:41.954
What the fuck is wrong
with you?

18:41.995 --> 18:43.747
Is that how you talk
to someone you supposedly love?

18:43.789 --> 18:46.125
Oh, shut the fuck up.
You know nothing about--

18:48.836 --> 18:50.879
About love?

18:53.715 --> 18:56.677
I know about love.

18:56.718 --> 18:58.846
- Lou, put the gun down.
- I came here for her.

19:01.807 --> 19:03.183
- Lou, put the gun down.
- For us.

19:03.225 --> 19:04.768
Yeah, you think
she fucking loves you?

19:04.810 --> 19:06.895
- Put the gun down.
- She doesn't care about you.

19:06.937 --> 19:08.981
- Stop talking!
- She doesn't care about me.

19:09.022 --> 19:10.732
She doesn't fucking love you.
- Stop talking.

19:10.774 --> 19:11.859
- She used you.
- Listen to me.

19:11.900 --> 19:13.068
Stop!
- That's what she did.

19:13.110 --> 19:14.611
- Stop it!
- She got exactly

19:14.653 --> 19:15.612
what she wanted.

19:15.654 --> 19:18.365
She has no use for either
one of us anymore.

19:18.407 --> 19:20.534
Lou, listen to me.

19:20.576 --> 19:22.369
He's not worth it.

19:22.411 --> 19:23.829
Put the gun down.

19:33.380 --> 19:36.508
You masturbate
with your right hand, yes?

19:40.721 --> 19:44.224
Fuck!

19:44.266 --> 19:47.060
Don't you fuck up her floors!

19:47.102 --> 19:48.187
It's over, you crazy bitch.

19:48.228 --> 19:50.772
It's over when I fucking say
it's over!

19:50.814 --> 19:52.482
Lou!

19:54.651 --> 19:55.569
Miles.

19:55.611 --> 19:59.156
Miles, baby.
- I just wanted you to love me.

19:59.198 --> 20:01.658
Everyone I love leaves me.

20:03.493 --> 20:04.745
Don't leave me.

20:04.786 --> 20:07.164
I told you this place
would destroy you

20:07.206 --> 20:08.874
if you didn't get out.

20:13.837 --> 20:16.423
Get out while you still can.

20:21.720 --> 20:24.723
We'll always be together.

20:24.765 --> 20:27.392
Why are you letting me go?

20:27.434 --> 20:31.605
Because I see you, April.

20:54.169 --> 20:56.672
If you want a happy ending...

21:00.842 --> 21:05.222
That depends, of course,
on where you stop your story.

21:24.283 --> 21:26.785
But maybe it's not
about the happy ending.

21:44.636 --> 21:47.139
Maybe it's just
about the story.

21:48.890 --> 21:54.396
There are stories of love
inspiring success...

21:56.523 --> 21:58.859
Over the most insurmountable
of odds...

21:58.900 --> 22:01.486
We're gonna move
to Hollywood one day.

22:01.528 --> 22:04.573
Promise?

22:04.614 --> 22:07.326
Promise.

22:08.869 --> 22:10.954
Empowering stories

22:10.996 --> 22:15.125
where we live
happily ever after

22:15.167 --> 22:16.835
and love never dies.

22:31.099 --> 22:33.352
This...

22:33.393 --> 22:36.063
is not one of those stories.
