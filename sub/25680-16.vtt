-What's all that?
-My latest pile of fan mail.

00:07.382 --> 00:11.720
I gotta be honest, I really feel like I'm
changing people's lives.

00:14.097 --> 00:15.640
That's a little grandiose,
don't you think?

00:16.725 --> 00:20.311
"Dear Amelia,
you have changed my life."

00:20.395 --> 00:22.522
I mean, I don't have
to tell you guys.

00:22.605 --> 00:25.108
You probably feel the same way
about your channel.

Cute? No, no, no, no.

00:46.963 --> 00:49.090
<i>Puke Plane 1 </i>was cute.

00:49.174 --> 00:51.051
<i>Puke Plane 2</i>
is totally different.

00:51.134 --> 00:54.387
It's about us saving
a whole plane full of people.

00:54.471 --> 00:57.891
So we, like you,
are changing lives.

-Uh-oh. Turbulence.

01:18.119 --> 01:21.581
I hope that doesn't affect
anyone's digestive system.

Maybe we shouldn't have served
under-cooked shrimp and goat's milk.

01:27.045 --> 01:29.297
Ah, ha-ha. I think we can
stop it there.

01:29.381 --> 01:31.007
You get the idea.

01:32.092 --> 01:35.762
No way, you guys finally made

Guys, you don't have
to be embarrassed.

02:11.214 --> 02:13.174
Not everyone
was put on this earth

02:13.258 --> 02:17.178
to make a difference.
The world needs clowns, too.

Are we-- are we clowns?
I don't wanna be a clown!

02:21.182 --> 02:23.143
Nobody wants to be
a clown, Paige.

02:23.226 --> 02:25.979
One day you just wake up,
realize you have no other skills

02:26.062 --> 02:28.064
and bam! You're a clown!

02:28.148 --> 02:31.109
Are we just wasting our time
here at the Vuuugle House?

Amelia changed her channel,
and is actually doing good in the world.

Nothing!

All right,
our first question

03:23.244 --> 03:26.456
comes from Isabella, 13.
She asks:

03:26.539 --> 03:29.042
"What do you guys like
to eat for breakfast?"

03:29.125 --> 03:32.295
Mmm. I see we're getting real
right off the bat.

03:32.379 --> 03:35.757
Isabella, have you ever
tried steel cut oatmeal?

03:35.840 --> 03:37.926
Neither have we, it's gross.

03:38.009 --> 03:39.219
That's why we eat frozen waffles.

03:39.302 --> 03:41.721
They are a breakfast miracle.

03:41.805 --> 03:42.972
They're frozen.

Then 30 seconds later,
they're not.

to the school dance but I'm really shy,

04:41.781 --> 04:43.783
and I've never asked out
a girl before.

04:43.867 --> 04:46.202
I mean, if she says no, it would be, like,
the worst thing ever.

I'd be so embarrassed I'd have to switch
schools, and I'd be lost forever.

mysteries right here in the couch?

around, but... you're fun!

to the dance with you.

your sensitive side.

your tough side.

O-okay.

And, I can't
reiterate this enough:

-share something personal about yourself.
-But remain mysterious.

Ooh, also use one of those
sticks that ninjas use.

what it's called.

don't you, Jackson?

08:29.259 --> 08:30.176

08:50.613 --> 08:51.865
And what happened
to your face?

08:51.948 --> 08:55.326
I asked Sasha to the dance
exactly how you told me to.

08:55.410 --> 08:58.621
And she said no. Now she hates me,
and it's all your fault.

09:00.290 --> 09:02.334
Hey, uh, not sure if
this is a good time,

09:02.417 --> 09:05.754

What?

10:05.230 --> 10:06.064

Then you told me
to share something personal.

is the beagle.

Ohh, that's how you got a black eye,
because she punched you.

10:24.249 --> 10:26.001
She didn't punch me!

10:26.084 --> 10:29.546
I got this because someone
told me to bring a bowstaff.

10:40.724 --> 10:43.351
If I hadn't been swinging that bowstaff,
I would've seen the ball.

10:43.435 --> 10:47.689
Okay, to be fair,
I specifically said "ninja stick."

10:48.940 --> 10:50.108
It's the same thing!

10:50.191 --> 10:52.527
It is the same thing.

10:52.610 --> 10:55.071
The advice you
gave me was terrible.

10:55.155 --> 10:56.406
I made a fool
out of myself,

10:56.489 --> 10:59.576
and now I have to go to the dance alone.
Thanks a lot.

11:02.704 --> 11:06.750
Well, we tried. Guess we're just not
cut out to change lives.

11:06.833 --> 11:09.544
Are you saying
we should give up?

11:09.627 --> 11:11.880
Did Kevin Durant give up
before he reached

11:11.963 --> 11:13.715
the National
Baseball Championship?

11:13.798 --> 11:15.633
That sounds wrong.

11:15.717 --> 11:19.637
Did I give up when I realized Kevin Durant
doesn't play baseball?

11:19.721 --> 11:23.767
That's happening right now, so... no?

11:24.059 --> 11:26.519
Frankie, this kid needs our help.

11:26.603 --> 11:28.688
This could be
our chance to change a life.

11:28.772 --> 11:30.899
Jackson chose us.

11:30.982 --> 11:32.734
[whispers] Will we choose him?

11:33.610 --> 11:37.155
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you
'cause you whispered for some reason.

11:37.238 --> 11:39.074
I-I said, "Will we choose him?"

11:39.157 --> 11:40.909
Oh, ha!

11:40.992 --> 11:44.496
-I thought you said, "Will a moose swim?
-[laughs]

11:44.621 --> 11:46.831
Either way, my answer is yes.

11:54.047 --> 11:58.426
Uh... Willow?
What are you doing?

11:58.510 --> 12:00.595
I'm gettin' yoked!

12:01.596 --> 12:02.889
Hang on, we're almost done
with this set.

12:19.239 --> 12:22.826
You're working out,
and you're talking like Bernie?

12:22.909 --> 12:25.912
The Bern-man's been teaching me
lots of things.

12:25.995 --> 12:29.374
Did you know cargo pockets can hold
an entire quesadilla?

12:31.751 --> 12:34.295
It took me six years
to learn that.

12:35.505 --> 12:36.756
Coo-coo.

12:36.840 --> 12:41.136
Did-did you just say "coo-coo"?

12:41.219 --> 12:42.679
Yeah, like Bernie does!

12:42.762 --> 12:45.557
He's my new best friend.

12:48.643 --> 12:51.229
Willow, a word?

12:52.439 --> 12:56.276
Young lady, I do not approve of you being
best friends with Bernie Schotz.

12:56.359 --> 13:00.155
Would this change your mind?

13:01.156 --> 13:04.367
Ew! Flexing to make
an irrelevant point?

13:04.451 --> 13:06.911
That's exactly
what Bernie would do!

13:06.995 --> 13:09.956
He is not someone
to model your life after.

13:10.040 --> 13:13.001
Why not? He's fun!

13:13.084 --> 13:17.881
Look, a lift sesh and a couple
"coo-coo"s can be fun,

13:17.964 --> 13:22.761
but before you know it,
you'll be having delusional fantasies.

13:22.844 --> 13:25.180
I'm worried about
your future, Willow.

13:37.567 --> 13:40.945
[gasps] You just had a fantasy!

13:42.530 --> 13:46.534
Willow, I'm sorry, but I forbid you from
hanging out with Bernie Schotz.

13:46.618 --> 13:48.828
-What?!
-As long as you live under

13:48.912 --> 13:51.831
my roof, you'll follow
my rules, young lady!

13:55.585 --> 13:57.504
Not-coo, not-coo.

13:57.587 --> 13:59.839
I heard that, missy.

13:59.923 --> 14:03.426
I am this close
to taking away skipping.

14:12.644 --> 14:13.645
All right.

14:14.187 --> 14:15.397
There he is.

14:15.480 --> 14:16.773
Let's walk up on that stage,

14:16.856 --> 14:18.608
and act like we're both
Jackson's dates.

14:18.692 --> 14:22.362
Sasha will be so jealous she'll
reconsider, and wanna be his date.

14:22.445 --> 14:25.156
Amen, sister.
Right after we hit the snack table--

14:25.240 --> 14:27.450
Oh, we're doing this now?

14:28.118 --> 14:28.952
[microphone feedback]

14:29.411 --> 14:31.996
Whaddup,
Jackson's middle school?

14:32.080 --> 14:36.209
Now, you might think this fine young
gentleman doesn't have a date,

14:36.292 --> 14:39.004
and you're right.
He has two.

14:39.087 --> 14:43.299
Us, we, we're the us,
the dates.

14:43.383 --> 14:45.885
-What are you guys doing?!
-We're helping!

14:45.969 --> 14:48.513
Sasha? Sasha,
if you're out there,

14:48.596 --> 14:52.058
you might want to reconsider your opinion
of this fine, young man

14:52.142 --> 14:57.897
because his two dates
are in high school.

14:57.981 --> 15:01.443
We can watch PG-13 movies,
and babysit,

15:01.526 --> 15:04.529
and almost get
our driver's license--

15:04.612 --> 15:06.531
-Permit.
-Permit!

15:08.033 --> 15:11.494
That's right, we're almost,
kind of drivers!

15:11.578 --> 15:13.038
Which makes us cool,

15:13.121 --> 15:19.502
which makes our date, Jackson,
by association, very cool.

15:19.586 --> 15:24.716
So go, dance,
and know that Jackson is cool,

15:24.799 --> 15:26.217
and full of dates.

15:26.301 --> 15:28.011
Not the fruit.

to this dance?

-I-- no-- that's not--
-Save it.

15:53.036 --> 15:55.830

15:58.375 --> 16:00.543

to me ever again.

16:07.425 --> 16:09.386
-Who was that?
-Sasha!

16:09.469 --> 16:12.097
Wait, you got Sasha to go
with you to the dance?

16:12.180 --> 16:15.558
Yes. I managed to fix everything
with her by myself.

16:15.642 --> 16:18.061
But now, thanks to you two,
she thinks I'm a jerk.

16:18.144 --> 16:21.022
-Jackson, we're so sorry.
-We just wanted to help.

16:21.106 --> 16:24.693
Well, you aren't helping.
You keep making things worse.

16:24.776 --> 16:27.987

we knew.

you got some fan mail.

No, on saving... Jackson.

17:28.715 --> 17:31.009

17:31.843 --> 17:32.927
Is it, Paige?

17:33.011 --> 17:36.473
Then why would it be specifically
addressed to us...

17:36.556 --> 17:38.308

-Uh...
-The reason we got into this <i>mishegoss</i>

to be in small cars

principal kicked us out of the dance,

he said we weren't allowed
in the school ever again.

22:25.512 --> 22:27.222
[drone blades whirring]

22:28.098 --> 22:29.224
What-what are you doing?

22:29.307 --> 22:30.850
This thing is harder to fly
than it looks.

22:30.934 --> 22:32.977
You're a liar, Oswaldo!

22:35.855 --> 22:36.690
[students shriek]

22:36.856 --> 22:38.525
-Ahh! Okay!
-Whoa!

22:38.608 --> 22:39.442
[students yell]

22:41.528 --> 22:43.488
[dramatic music]

22:47.242 --> 22:49.411
Whoaa, ohh!

22:49.494 --> 22:50.870
[electronic beeps]

22:52.664 --> 22:53.498
[screams]
Oww!

22:54.958 --> 22:56.334
Uh-oh...

22:57.669 --> 22:59.421
My ankle.
I think it's sprained.

22:59.629 --> 23:03.425
I'm up for a soccer scholarship,
and the tryouts are tomorrow!

23:03.508 --> 23:04.843
My life is over!

23:04.926 --> 23:05.760
[both] Uhhh...

23:06.803 --> 23:10.181
-This is bad.
-So bad.

23:11.933 --> 23:16.479
How long do you think I need to wait
before I go in and get my drone back?

23:16.563 --> 23:18.648
Oh, no, Frankie, look,
is that Sasha?

23:18.732 --> 23:20.692
Oh, my gosh, Jackson, are you okay?

23:20.775 --> 23:23.903
Those crazy Bizaardvark girls
attacked me with a drone.

23:23.987 --> 23:26.531
Ugh, those two are the worst.

23:28.908 --> 23:30.368
Wait... you can't
stand them either?

23:30.452 --> 23:33.079
Huh, I guess we have
something in common.

23:34.664 --> 23:37.667
Um, here, let me help you up.

23:41.546 --> 23:44.299
Wow. That was an unexpected twist.

23:44.382 --> 23:46.760
I guess we did know
what we were doing!

23:46.843 --> 23:49.220
Hey, Jackson?
Can I tell you something

23:49.304 --> 23:51.473
I've wanted to tell you
for a really long time?

23:52.223 --> 23:54.392
I have a huge crush on--

23:54.476 --> 23:55.310
-[thud]
-[Sasha screams]

23:56.227 --> 23:58.313
-Forgot to turn the drone off!
-We should run.

23:58.396 --> 24:00.982
<i>Puke Plane 3,</i>
here we come!
