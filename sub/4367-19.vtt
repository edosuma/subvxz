12:56.209 --> 12:59.077
The bills were marked
by the feds.

12:59.079 --> 13:01.546
Found in a raid on a bodega that
Elias was operating out of.

13:01.548 --> 13:02.797
So?

13:02.799 --> 13:05.250
Money never made it
to evidence.

13:05.252 --> 13:08.219
So either Elias's boys
got a hold of it

13:08.221 --> 13:10.371
or some dirty cops did.

13:10.373 --> 13:12.540
Either way, it stinks.

13:14.226 --> 13:16.060
You saying I had something
to do with it?

13:16.062 --> 13:19.881
I'm saying Szymanski
got set up.

13:19.883 --> 13:23.485
And by you keeping quiet, makes
me think you were in on it.

13:25.104 --> 13:26.738
See, I got friends
who used to work

13:26.740 --> 13:28.439
in your old precinct, Fusco.

13:28.441 --> 13:30.658
I heard about your crew.

13:30.660 --> 13:32.443
Two are in jail
and one's missing,

13:32.445 --> 13:35.780
and you're calling me dirty?

13:35.782 --> 13:38.232
Let me spell it out for you.

13:38.234 --> 13:41.753
- Stay away from Carter.
- Or what?

13:47.409 --> 13:48.843
What's going on, fellas?

13:48.845 --> 13:51.296
That's a good question.

13:54.600 --> 13:57.552
What is going on?

14:07.863 --> 14:09.931
I can do that for you, Monica.

14:09.933 --> 14:11.566
Oh, it's okay.
I've got it.

14:11.568 --> 14:13.701
You want me to pick you up
some lunch?

14:13.703 --> 14:16.204
No, I have a meeting.

14:16.206 --> 14:17.539
I don't have anything
scheduled.

14:17.541 --> 14:19.123
Oh, it was a last minute thing.

14:19.125 --> 14:21.543
I didn't bother putting it
on the calendar.

14:30.636 --> 14:32.954
- Mr. Reese, where are you?
- On my way.

14:32.956 --> 14:34.722
You learn what
our number's up to?

14:34.724 --> 14:36.558
I believe Ms. Jacobs
is about to hand off

14:36.560 --> 14:38.760
some sensitive information.

14:38.762 --> 14:40.428
So Monica....

14:40.430 --> 14:42.964
Or perhaps not.
I'll patch you in.

14:42.966 --> 14:44.182
...what was so urgent I had to

14:44.184 --> 14:45.483
cancel my lunch
and meet you out here?

14:45.485 --> 14:47.352
Justin Lee.

14:47.354 --> 14:49.470
He's one of your engineers
in R&D.

14:49.472 --> 14:51.773
Yeah, he died in an accident
a little over a week ago.

14:51.775 --> 14:52.974
It was tragic.

14:52.976 --> 14:54.809
I discovered something
concerning.

14:54.811 --> 14:57.111
When I had flowers sent
to his parents,

14:57.113 --> 14:58.997
the florist said no one
by the name of Lee

14:58.999 --> 15:00.415
lived at that address.

15:00.417 --> 15:01.833
People move,
change their address.

15:01.835 --> 15:04.786
I checked.
The parents never lived there.

15:04.788 --> 15:06.821
It's not just that.
Everything about Lee,

15:06.823 --> 15:11.376
from his contact information
to his work history, was a lie.

15:11.378 --> 15:13.828
I think
he may have been a plant.

15:13.830 --> 15:15.663
A plant?
For who?

15:15.665 --> 15:18.433
Could be any
of our competitors.

15:18.435 --> 15:22.336
That's why I didn't want to have
this conversation at the office.

15:22.338 --> 15:25.106
And then, there's this.

15:27.009 --> 15:30.194
She just gave him the flash
drive that she used last night.

15:30.196 --> 15:32.697
I found Lee's computer,
made copies of his files

15:32.699 --> 15:34.515
and found a handful
of encrypted emails

15:34.517 --> 15:35.783
sent the day he died.

15:35.785 --> 15:37.735
I tried, but I couldn't
open them.

15:37.737 --> 15:39.020
Who else knows about this?

15:39.022 --> 15:40.855
Just you.

15:40.857 --> 15:42.540
Seeing as he worked
in your division,

15:42.542 --> 15:44.042
I thought you'd want to
get out in front of this.

15:44.044 --> 15:45.743
I do.
I'll look into it.

15:45.745 --> 15:48.796
Then we can tell the old man
together, okay?

15:48.798 --> 15:50.632
And, Monica...

15:50.634 --> 15:53.885
thank you.

15:53.887 --> 15:56.370
I need to see the emails
on that drive.

15:56.372 --> 15:58.973
I'll have to contrive a reason
to get into his office.

15:58.975 --> 16:01.809
I have a better idea.

16:01.811 --> 16:03.511
Excuse me.

16:14.406 --> 16:16.157
Nice to have you back.

16:18.393 --> 16:21.612
[Staticky voices, sounds]

16:25.400 --> 16:28.169
Thanks for meeting me,
Mr. Quinn.

16:28.171 --> 16:29.921
How's the shoulder?

16:29.923 --> 16:33.574
It's getting stronger
day by day.

16:33.576 --> 16:35.242
You sounded concerned
on the phone.

16:35.244 --> 16:36.844
There's been
some questions about

16:36.846 --> 16:38.846
the Szymanski investigation.

16:38.848 --> 16:40.882
Like, who my source was
about the money.

16:40.884 --> 16:43.601
- And you said?
- Nothing.

16:43.603 --> 16:46.888
You asked me to keep your name
out of it, and I have.

16:46.890 --> 16:50.692
Thing is, uh,
I've been wondering myself.

16:50.694 --> 16:52.226
Where did that tip come from?

16:52.228 --> 16:55.146
Well, the tip was strong.
Why does it matter?

16:55.148 --> 16:58.265
A dead detective's reputation
is on the line.

16:58.267 --> 17:00.601
It matters.

17:00.603 --> 17:02.120
Cal, in my position

17:02.122 --> 17:04.655
I'm constantly being offered
information.

17:04.656 --> 17:06.290
And the reason people

17:06.291 --> 17:09.877
come to me is they know
I will keep their confidence.

17:09.878 --> 17:12.497
Right.

17:15.834 --> 17:19.470
Uh, look...

17:19.472 --> 17:24.125
the tip came from
one of Elias's soldiers.

17:24.127 --> 17:26.844
Since Elias has been in prison,
his men have struggled.

17:26.846 --> 17:30.481
This guy was just tired
of seeing Szymanski getting paid

17:30.483 --> 17:33.134
while he scraped by.

17:33.136 --> 17:35.820
Now, I could have given
that information to anybody,

17:35.822 --> 17:40.241
but I wanted my godson
to get the credit for it.

17:40.243 --> 17:44.328
I imagine whoever's questioned
you wish they had made the bust.

17:44.330 --> 17:47.532
Don't let them rattle you.

17:47.534 --> 17:49.534
We good?

17:49.536 --> 17:51.085
Yeah.

17:51.087 --> 17:52.954
Thanks, Mr. Quinn.

17:54.373 --> 17:56.541
Anytime.

18:04.767 --> 18:07.168
He gonna be a problem?

18:09.721 --> 18:12.557
Let's hope not.

18:18.781 --> 18:21.232
So Monica wasn't spying.

18:21.234 --> 18:23.534
She was hunting a spy.

18:23.536 --> 18:25.186
Which means the threat
may be coming from

18:25.188 --> 18:27.205
whoever Lee was spying for.

18:27.207 --> 18:30.908
I've asked Detective Carter
to look into his death.

18:33.045 --> 18:36.230
Ms. Jacobs's phone
seems to be syncing.

18:36.232 --> 18:37.999
She's not doing it.

18:38.001 --> 18:39.801
- Then who is?
- Good question.

18:39.803 --> 18:40.935
They're adding contacts,
appointments,

18:40.937 --> 18:42.436
phone calls she never made.

18:42.438 --> 18:44.255
Mr. Reese, something's
terribly wrong.

18:52.397 --> 18:54.048
Excuse me, this is my office.

18:54.050 --> 18:55.516
You'll need to wait here, please.

18:55.518 --> 18:56.851
What the hell's going on?

18:56.853 --> 18:58.769
I'd ask you the same question,
Monica.

18:58.771 --> 19:01.405
But by the looks of it,
the answer's pretty clear.

19:01.407 --> 19:03.024
Security found
confidential designs

19:03.026 --> 19:05.159
and documents on your computer.

19:05.161 --> 19:06.944
Ross, I told you
those files were from Lee.

19:06.946 --> 19:08.446
Then why were
they attached to emails

19:08.448 --> 19:10.615
you were preparing to send
to our main competitors?

19:10.617 --> 19:12.033
Phone calls, meetings.

19:12.035 --> 19:13.518
You were meeting with anyone
and everyone.

19:13.520 --> 19:14.785
What?

19:14.787 --> 19:16.504
Lee wasn't the spy.
You were.

19:16.506 --> 19:19.423
That's impossible.
Jerome knows my schedule.

19:19.425 --> 19:21.626
I should have said something,
Mr. Haskell.

19:21.628 --> 19:24.178
She's been acting strangely
for a while now,

19:24.180 --> 19:25.412
keeping her own schedule,

19:25.414 --> 19:26.764
making off the book
appointments.

19:26.766 --> 19:28.182
Jerome!

19:28.184 --> 19:29.583
I'm sorry, Monica.

19:29.585 --> 19:31.752
I don't know what
you want me to say.

19:31.754 --> 19:34.421
- Martin, listen--
- Monica, please!

19:34.423 --> 19:36.641
- Security will show you out.
- You're firing me?

19:36.643 --> 19:37.859
Effective immediately,

19:37.861 --> 19:39.593
with civil and criminal
charges pending.

19:39.595 --> 19:41.279
Martin, I've worked for you
for ten years!

19:41.281 --> 19:43.814
Then you can afford
a good lawyer.

19:43.816 --> 19:45.149
This way, please.

19:45.151 --> 19:47.451
You... this is a mistake.

19:47.453 --> 19:51.622
I wasn't stealing anything.
If you just let me explain...

19:51.624 --> 19:54.709
Ms. Jacobs has just been
terminated from Rylatech.

19:54.711 --> 19:57.578
Someone may be trying
to silence her.

19:57.580 --> 20:01.465
I'm afraid they won't stop
until they've done so...

20:01.467 --> 20:03.334
permanently.

20:14.859 --> 20:18.228
Good morning, Mr. Reese.
Any news on Ms. Jacobs?

20:18.230 --> 20:20.330
Yes.

20:20.332 --> 20:21.698
She's having coffee,

20:21.700 --> 20:23.200
right in front of Rylatech.

20:23.202 --> 20:24.751
Something tells me

20:24.753 --> 20:26.269
she's not taking
her termination lying down.

20:26.271 --> 20:27.621
I've gone over everything

20:27.623 --> 20:29.289
that Ms. Jacobs collected
on Justin Lee,

20:29.291 --> 20:31.424
the potential spy
she was looking into,

20:31.426 --> 20:33.043
and she was right.

20:33.045 --> 20:36.763
Lee's been operating under
a remarkably deep cover.

20:36.765 --> 20:39.332
Take his degree from MIT.

20:39.334 --> 20:42.135
Certified with
a slightly outdated seal.

20:42.137 --> 20:45.171
His New Jersey birth
certificate, medical history.

20:45.173 --> 20:46.473
Whoever set this up--

20:46.475 --> 20:48.174
They're pros.

20:48.176 --> 20:49.693
That's how they were able
to frame her so quickly

20:49.695 --> 20:51.728
when they discovered
she was on to them.

20:51.730 --> 20:54.347
The question is,
who did the framing?

20:54.349 --> 20:57.617
If I could decrypt his emails,
they might tell us.

21:04.158 --> 21:07.244
She's tailing her assistant,
Finch.

21:13.117 --> 21:14.585
Hope you don't expect me
to play.

21:14.587 --> 21:16.870
No offense, Detective,
but my opponent is someone

21:16.872 --> 21:18.288
who brings a little more
to the table,

21:18.290 --> 21:20.190
and you're breaking
my concentration.

21:20.192 --> 21:22.259
I'll cut to it, then.

21:22.261 --> 21:23.544
Detective named Szymanski.

21:23.546 --> 21:25.462
Organized crime.

21:25.464 --> 21:27.881
Was he on your payroll?

21:27.883 --> 21:29.583
Afraid you made a bad move,
Detective.

21:29.585 --> 21:31.018
Just trying
to get some answers.

21:31.020 --> 21:34.054
Then start asking
better questions.

21:38.226 --> 21:42.195
Who benefits from Szymanski's
arrest and murder?

21:42.197 --> 21:46.149
How could one arrange these acts
without being suspected?

21:48.152 --> 21:50.937
And who's at the center
of the strings

21:50.939 --> 21:53.740
that were quietly pulled?

21:53.742 --> 21:56.660
See, I think you something
you don't even know you know,

21:56.662 --> 21:58.495
which means you're playing
a chess game

21:58.497 --> 22:00.280
of your own, Detective.
You just don't realize it yet.

22:00.282 --> 22:02.249
Did you give money
to Szymanski?

22:02.251 --> 22:04.685
Absolutely...

22:04.687 --> 22:06.053
and he threw it in our faces.

22:06.055 --> 22:10.140
He was clean,
and you got played by HR.

22:13.645 --> 22:16.813
It was nice meeting you,
Detective Beecher.

22:16.815 --> 22:18.615
Word of advice.

22:18.617 --> 22:20.434
Choose your next move wisely,

22:20.436 --> 22:23.070
or it's going
to be chosen for you.

22:25.974 --> 22:27.608
Detective Carter,

22:27.610 --> 22:29.576
have you had a chance
to look into Lee's death?

22:29.578 --> 22:30.811
That's why I'm calling.

22:30.813 --> 22:32.979
His BMW's black box said

22:32.981 --> 22:35.265
there was no impact
from any other car.

22:35.267 --> 22:38.818
No brake or system failure,
just simple accident.

22:38.820 --> 22:41.254
I decided I'd take prints
off the body,

22:41.256 --> 22:42.556
see what popped in the system.

22:42.558 --> 22:44.174
Did the prints tell you anything?

22:44.176 --> 22:45.876
Couldn't get them.
The body's gone.

22:45.878 --> 22:47.127
What?

22:47.129 --> 22:48.962
Searched that morgue
for 45 minutes.

22:48.964 --> 22:51.831
Somebody got in there,
got your boy, Lee,

22:51.833 --> 22:55.135
vanished without a trace.

22:58.556 --> 23:02.309
Not bearing good news,
I assume.

23:02.311 --> 23:05.729
Beecher's looking for answers.

23:05.731 --> 23:09.866
One of our guys
at Rikers saw him, with Elias.

23:11.419 --> 23:15.288
Looks like your talk with him
didn't do the trick.

23:15.290 --> 23:17.857
That's a damn shame.

23:17.859 --> 23:20.410
We could promote him
out of town.

23:20.412 --> 23:22.579
Desk job upstate.

23:27.001 --> 23:30.253
I always told Cal
to be careful.

23:30.255 --> 23:33.056
Being a cop's a dangerous job.

23:41.716 --> 23:46.502
[Speaking Mandarin] _

23:46.688 --> 23:48.572
Jerome!

23:48.574 --> 23:51.742
- Monica. What are you doing here?
- What happened yesterday?

23:51.744 --> 23:52.993
Why did you say those things?

23:52.995 --> 23:54.578
Were you following me?
Let go.

23:54.580 --> 23:56.113
Not till I get some answers.

23:56.115 --> 23:57.447
I don't answer to you anymore,
bitch!

23:57.449 --> 23:59.332
[Grunts]

23:59.334 --> 24:02.619
Now, be nice, and answer
the lady's question.

24:02.621 --> 24:04.588
In English, not Mandarin.

24:04.590 --> 24:07.040
Who are you working for?

24:07.042 --> 24:10.427
You're wasting your time.
There's too many of us.

24:10.429 --> 24:11.511
[Glass shatters] Aah!

24:11.513 --> 24:12.796
Get down.

24:14.432 --> 24:16.933
- Who are you?
- Right now, an easy target.

24:22.106 --> 24:23.356
Mr. Reese!

24:23.358 --> 24:25.726
- I have news.
- Can it wait, Finch?

24:25.728 --> 24:27.694
I've cracked Lee's
encrypted emails.

24:27.696 --> 24:30.180
They're messages,
reporting back to his father,

24:30.182 --> 24:32.866
a high-ranking official
in the Chinese Communist Party.

24:32.868 --> 24:34.317
[Gunshot] What are you saying?

24:34.319 --> 24:36.236
Lee wasn't spying
for a company.

24:36.238 --> 24:38.121
He was spying for his country.

24:38.123 --> 24:40.273
We just picked a fight with
the People's Republic of China.

24:40.275 --> 24:41.792
Where are you taking me?
[Gunshot]

24:41.794 --> 24:43.460
Someplace safe.

24:43.462 --> 24:45.846
Let's use the new
accommodations, Mr. Reese.

24:45.848 --> 24:47.631
I'll catch up to you
as soon as--

24:52.136 --> 24:55.555
It's not nice when someone
hunts you down, now is it?

25:09.016 --> 25:10.634
What brings you here,
Ms. Shaw?

25:10.636 --> 25:13.186
I assume you wanted me
to find you.

25:13.188 --> 25:16.072
Why else would you have given me
your number?

25:18.159 --> 25:22.045
I guess I imagined
that you would just call,

25:22.047 --> 25:24.814
but I suppose this works too.

25:24.816 --> 25:27.751
My offer still stands,
you know.

25:30.621 --> 25:32.756
You think I should have
a hobby.

25:32.758 --> 25:34.357
Now what would that be?

25:34.359 --> 25:36.626
Hanging around a derelict
library with you,

25:36.628 --> 25:38.845
your poorly-socialized
guard dog,

25:38.847 --> 25:40.797
and Bear here?

25:40.799 --> 25:42.349
Bit of a comedown
from saving the world,

25:42.351 --> 25:45.352
I guess, but we have
our moments.

25:45.354 --> 25:47.521
And what's your end, Harold?

25:47.523 --> 25:49.422
Is this your hobby?

25:49.424 --> 25:51.358
Running a halfway house
for retired assassins?

25:51.360 --> 25:53.393
I hate to see talent
go to waste.

25:53.395 --> 25:56.496
Awfully trusting of you,
now, isn't it?

25:56.498 --> 25:58.431
I'm quite confident,
Ms. Shaw,

25:58.433 --> 26:01.201
that you are the first person
that's ever said that to me.

26:01.203 --> 26:03.537
Besides, you're not holding
a firearm.

26:03.539 --> 26:05.705
Looks like progress.
What can I do for you?

26:05.706 --> 26:07.606
_

26:07.708 --> 26:11.578
Interesting story in the news
this morning.

26:11.580 --> 26:15.715
A CIA operative died in the line
of duty on a covert operation.

26:15.717 --> 26:18.051
He'd uncovered
a domestic terrorism plot.

26:18.053 --> 26:20.286
Now, the Agency would neither
deny or confirm this,

26:20.288 --> 26:21.922
of course, but a journalist

26:21.924 --> 26:25.124
received leaked documents
from within Langley itself.

26:28.429 --> 26:30.280
I saw the story too.

26:30.282 --> 26:32.599
It's very sad.

26:32.601 --> 26:34.734
He seemed to have died
heroically.

26:34.736 --> 26:38.922
You and I both know that Cole
did not work for the CIA.

26:38.924 --> 26:41.024
So I have this crazy theory

26:41.026 --> 26:44.494
that someone hacked into one of
the most powerful, clandestine

26:44.496 --> 26:46.997
agencies in the world
and created an employee who,

26:46.999 --> 26:51.084
up until yesterday,
did not exist.

26:51.086 --> 26:54.170
That does sound somewhat
farfetched.

27:00.494 --> 27:03.630
My friend from the hotel.

27:03.632 --> 27:06.266
Our conversation was cut short.

27:06.268 --> 27:09.168
Yet we seemed to have
so much in common.

27:10.504 --> 27:13.356
Tell me about her.

27:13.358 --> 27:16.509
My relationship with that
woman is rather complicated.

27:19.030 --> 27:21.147
What's your interest?

27:21.149 --> 27:25.318
You think I need a hobby, Harold?

27:25.320 --> 27:28.071
I think I just found one.

27:39.050 --> 27:40.634
Traitor.

27:40.636 --> 27:44.203
[Dog whines]

27:45.973 --> 27:49.676
Lee was a spy... for China?

27:49.678 --> 27:51.711
Looks that way.

27:51.713 --> 27:55.048
Any idea why China might be
interested in Rylatech?

27:55.050 --> 27:56.733
Our proprietary designs keep us

27:56.735 --> 27:58.718
at the forefront
of the industry.

27:58.720 --> 28:00.153
Maybe they want to steal
our work.

28:00.155 --> 28:01.855
Or sabotage it.

28:01.857 --> 28:05.108
Lee could've been secretly
altering your designs,

28:05.110 --> 28:06.359
making them unworkable.

28:06.361 --> 28:08.111
And Jerome?

28:08.113 --> 28:10.113
Probably there to keep
an eye on you.

28:10.115 --> 28:13.783
He was my assistant
for over two years.

28:13.785 --> 28:16.086
[Sighs] And now he's dead.

28:16.088 --> 28:18.237
We won't let that happen
to you.

28:18.239 --> 28:19.956
We?

28:22.176 --> 28:24.844
- Miss Jacobs.
- Harold?

28:26.464 --> 28:27.881
I'd have been here sooner,
but a friend of yours

28:27.883 --> 28:30.249
stopped by to say
how much she enjoyed

28:30.251 --> 28:32.352
your chat the other night.

28:32.354 --> 28:34.437
Wait...

28:34.439 --> 28:36.923
so you're not an IT guy?

28:36.925 --> 28:39.425
Not in any traditional sense,
but perhaps

28:39.427 --> 28:41.945
we should set those questions
aside until we've

28:41.947 --> 28:44.481
dealt with whomever it is
that's trying to kill you.

28:44.483 --> 28:46.933
Now, I expect that it was more
than just your assistant

28:46.935 --> 28:48.401
who was working
with Mr. Lee.

28:48.403 --> 28:50.036
To place someone in a division

28:50.038 --> 28:52.038
as secure as Research
and Development?

28:52.040 --> 28:54.791
They need someone with access,
hiring approval.

28:54.793 --> 28:57.443
Well, R&D is Ross's division.

28:59.113 --> 29:02.215
He's the only one
I told about Lee.

29:02.217 --> 29:06.252
Well, I-I need to go
to the police, or FBI.

29:06.254 --> 29:08.555
- They're expecting you to.
- While you're being questioned,

29:08.557 --> 29:10.056
they'll be destroying
any evidence

29:10.058 --> 29:13.760
that could implicate them
or exonerate you...

29:13.762 --> 29:17.130
unless we get to
that evidence first.

29:19.350 --> 29:22.102
All my network requests
are being blocked.

29:22.104 --> 29:24.487
Did you try the web interface?

29:24.489 --> 29:26.305
Yes, but I can't
access settings,

29:26.307 --> 29:29.359
or the RPC portmapper.

29:29.361 --> 29:31.811
May I?

29:31.813 --> 29:35.949
This was one of my babies.

29:35.951 --> 29:38.868
Completely rebuilt
the interface,

29:38.870 --> 29:41.087
disabled the portmapper.

29:41.089 --> 29:42.756
Secondary authentication?

29:42.758 --> 29:46.092
Added for access
to the FTP and SNMP.

29:46.094 --> 29:48.545
If you two would rather
be alone...

29:51.465 --> 29:54.300
I made it virtually impossible
to hack into our company,

29:54.302 --> 29:56.302
and now here I am doing
just that.

29:56.304 --> 29:58.688
Ten years of my life.

29:58.690 --> 30:02.609
Nights, weekends.

30:02.611 --> 30:05.678
You know how many offers
I turned away?

30:05.680 --> 30:07.513
That's a rare kind of loyalty
these days.

30:10.184 --> 30:12.819
Truth is, I never wanted
to work anywhere else.

30:14.789 --> 30:18.158
Those people aren't just
co-workers, they're my family.

30:18.160 --> 30:21.077
And now they think
I've betrayed them.

30:21.079 --> 30:23.496
The look on Martin's face...

30:25.082 --> 30:27.667
You may be down, Monica,
but you're not out.

30:27.669 --> 30:28.968
Not yet.

30:28.970 --> 30:31.554
If I can get past
this server firewall,

30:31.556 --> 30:33.673
we should be able to locate
the hidden network

30:33.675 --> 30:36.176
that Lee and the other spies
are using.

30:39.346 --> 30:42.048
Uh-oh.

30:42.050 --> 30:44.383
- What is it?
- We've been hacked.

30:44.385 --> 30:48.238
They've broken the password
coded into the laptop's battery.

30:48.240 --> 30:50.190
Hijacked the firmware.
Get back. Get back!

30:52.243 --> 30:53.910
What happened?

30:53.912 --> 30:55.895
They disabled the micro
controller that regulates

30:55.897 --> 30:57.063
the battery's charge.

30:57.065 --> 30:58.915
Spies must be monitoring
the network.

30:58.917 --> 31:00.950
- So what now?
- If I can't get through

31:00.952 --> 31:02.702
the firewall?
I'm not sure.

31:02.704 --> 31:05.004
What about bypassing it
all together

31:05.006 --> 31:07.040
and directly accessing
the servers?

31:07.042 --> 31:08.708
That would require going back
inside Rylatech.

31:08.710 --> 31:10.693
- I could show you where to go.
- It's too risky.

31:10.695 --> 31:12.345
Everyone in that building
knows your face.

31:12.347 --> 31:16.549
Ms. Jacobs, do you still have
your employee ID card?

31:16.551 --> 31:19.519
Yes, but it's been deactivated.

31:19.521 --> 31:20.887
Besides, the locator chip

31:20.889 --> 31:22.889
would tell security
exactly where I was.

31:22.891 --> 31:24.423
Yes, I'm aware.

31:24.425 --> 31:28.278
[Staticky voices, sounds]

31:32.917 --> 31:35.985
She's not allowed
on the premises.

31:35.987 --> 31:37.904
Let's go.

31:44.611 --> 31:46.162
Up on the left.

31:53.304 --> 31:56.639
[Growling]

31:58.409 --> 31:59.625
Bear, <i>stellen.</i>

31:59.627 --> 32:01.427
<i>Stellen!</i>
[Dog barking]

32:01.429 --> 32:03.846
In here!

32:05.465 --> 32:07.066
You're clear, Mr. Reese.

32:07.068 --> 32:09.319
Let me know when you find
the server room.

32:16.193 --> 32:17.660
We're in.

32:17.662 --> 32:19.312
Now see if there's
a catalog server.

32:19.314 --> 32:21.331
Catalog server?

32:21.333 --> 32:23.750
Here.

32:26.820 --> 32:28.621
Transmitter's installed.

32:28.623 --> 32:30.340
He should have access.

32:30.342 --> 32:31.925
Now I'm connected.

32:31.927 --> 32:34.160
Let's see what we can find.

32:37.014 --> 32:38.631
How are we looking, Finch?

32:38.633 --> 32:42.135
I've found lots of high-level,
encrypted traffic

32:42.137 --> 32:45.004
using a suspicious amount
of bandwidth.

32:45.006 --> 32:46.672
We don't have much time here.

32:46.674 --> 32:49.192
I'm working as fast as I can,
Mr. Reese.

32:49.194 --> 32:50.843
Oh, that's interesting.

32:50.845 --> 32:54.163
- What?
- Nothing.

32:54.165 --> 32:57.400
I've located the end users
receiving the traffic.

32:57.402 --> 32:59.285
- You mean the spies?
- Yes.

32:59.287 --> 33:01.154
It appears that we may have
underestimated

33:01.156 --> 33:02.855
the scale of the operation.

33:02.857 --> 33:06.709
That's over half of our
senior-level employees...

33:06.711 --> 33:08.211
in every department.

33:08.213 --> 33:11.331
All this rerouted traffic
seems to be coming

33:11.333 --> 33:13.833
from an unending number
of networks

33:13.835 --> 33:18.054
belonging to... the government.

33:18.056 --> 33:20.006
Military, banking institutions.

33:20.008 --> 33:24.010
These are Rylatech clients.
But how--

33:25.545 --> 33:27.180
Our routers and switches.

33:27.182 --> 33:29.983
They've been compromised.
They have back doors.

33:29.985 --> 33:31.884
The spies aren't spying
on Rylatech.

33:31.886 --> 33:33.486
They're using Rylatech's
technology

33:33.488 --> 33:36.322
- to spy on the entire country.
- My God.

33:36.324 --> 33:38.024
Who are these people?

33:38.026 --> 33:41.361
Mr. Reese, I fear that our own
spying has been detected.

33:41.363 --> 33:43.729
You and Ms. Jacobs need to
get out of there, now.

33:46.733 --> 33:49.252
I couldn't agree more, Finch.

34:00.214 --> 34:02.415
Unh!

34:08.755 --> 34:10.156
[Grunts]

34:12.775 --> 34:14.226
Mr. Reese, are you okay?

34:14.228 --> 34:15.895
We're fine.

34:15.897 --> 34:18.781
But they've got operatives
inside the building.

34:18.783 --> 34:21.766
They're communicating on
an internal SMS network

34:21.768 --> 34:23.601
receiving messages from
a single location,

34:23.603 --> 34:26.322
the office belonging
to Ross Haskell.

34:26.324 --> 34:28.373
Where's Haskell's office?

34:28.376 --> 34:30.576
This way.

34:30.578 --> 34:33.612
Mr. Reese, there's something
you ought to know about Haskell.

34:33.614 --> 34:34.914
His name's not on the list.

34:34.916 --> 34:37.750
Haskell is not
one of the spies.

34:39.253 --> 34:40.753
Oh!
[Gun cocks]

34:40.755 --> 34:43.089
Drop your weapon, now!

34:43.956 --> 34:46.625
Martin?

35:00.869 --> 35:03.403
Martin!
You?

35:03.405 --> 35:06.373
I know how this looks, Monica.

35:06.375 --> 35:08.408
How it looks?

35:08.410 --> 35:11.361
You're a murderer,
and a spy for China.

35:11.363 --> 35:14.915
No! I'm just protecting what
I've spent my life building.

35:14.917 --> 35:16.700
How could you do this?

35:16.702 --> 35:19.636
Simple economics.
When the dot-com bust hit,

35:19.638 --> 35:20.754
we were bankrupt.

35:20.756 --> 35:22.973
A prime takeover target.

35:22.975 --> 35:24.708
And then an opportunity
presented itself.

35:24.710 --> 35:28.512
To save your company
by selling out your country.

35:28.514 --> 35:30.013
Who the hell are you?

35:30.015 --> 35:32.349
That doesn't matter.
He's right.

35:32.351 --> 35:34.434
He's a fool.

35:34.436 --> 35:36.937
The world has changed, Monica.

35:36.939 --> 35:38.272
There is no value placed

35:38.274 --> 35:42.025
on outdated notions
like patriotism anymore.

35:42.027 --> 35:44.328
And companies like ours,

35:44.330 --> 35:46.914
we have to constantly
look forward to the future

35:46.916 --> 35:49.867
so that we can prepare
for what comes next.

35:49.869 --> 35:51.418
And what's that?

35:51.420 --> 35:53.570
Selling information
instead of protecting it?

35:53.572 --> 35:56.406
Controlling it.

35:56.408 --> 35:59.259
Because whoever controls
information

35:59.261 --> 36:00.911
will control the future.

36:00.913 --> 36:04.181
And what about what this
company supposedly stood for?

36:04.183 --> 36:06.750
The great American
success story.

36:06.752 --> 36:08.018
People love stories.

36:08.020 --> 36:09.269
I believed it.

36:09.271 --> 36:10.971
Of course.

36:10.973 --> 36:12.806
And that's why you were
so good at your job

36:12.808 --> 36:16.727
and why you could never
be trusted with the truth.

36:16.729 --> 36:18.595
Just like Ross,

36:18.597 --> 36:20.931
one of several victims

36:20.933 --> 36:23.617
of a disgraced former employee

36:23.619 --> 36:27.070
who broke in, shot him,

36:27.072 --> 36:29.539
and then turned the gun
on herself.

36:29.541 --> 36:31.124
Mr. Reese, I've alerted
the authorities,

36:31.126 --> 36:33.043
and I've sent the evidence
to the FBI.

36:33.045 --> 36:35.295
Your plan won't work.

36:35.297 --> 36:38.749
The feds are on the way.
[Phone rings]

36:41.085 --> 36:43.921
- Yes?
- Mr. Baxter.

36:43.923 --> 36:45.973
Do you recall our discussion

36:45.975 --> 36:47.958
the day we sealed
our arrangement?

36:47.960 --> 36:50.177
Yes.

36:50.179 --> 36:52.295
The time has come.

36:52.297 --> 36:55.515
Your family
will be provided for.

36:57.936 --> 37:00.020
I understand.

37:08.646 --> 37:11.448
[Gunshot]
Oh! Oh! [Gasps]

37:11.650 --> 37:14.684
Mr. Reese?
Mr. Reese?

37:14.686 --> 37:16.553
We're okay, Finch.

37:21.242 --> 37:23.910
They're all gone.

37:23.912 --> 37:25.679
[Whistles]

37:25.681 --> 37:28.882
[Dog barking]

37:28.884 --> 37:34.704
[Phone ringing]

37:38.042 --> 37:41.144
We couldn't do whatever
this is at our desks?

37:41.146 --> 37:43.379
This? No.

37:43.381 --> 37:44.848
[Beep]

37:44.850 --> 37:46.549
[On tape] Did you give money
to Szymanski?

37:46.551 --> 37:49.219
[On tape] Absolutely,
and he threw it in our faces.

37:49.221 --> 37:50.386
He was clean,

37:50.388 --> 37:54.390
and you got played by HR.
[Beep]

37:54.392 --> 37:58.411
Beecher was trying to find out
who set up Szymanski.

37:58.413 --> 38:00.580
It means he wasn't in on it,
Carter.

38:00.582 --> 38:04.084
And that someone
in HR used him.

38:04.086 --> 38:05.952
We need to get this
to IAB so they can--

38:05.954 --> 38:07.403
Whoa, whoa, whoa, IAB?

38:07.405 --> 38:09.956
Not like this was
a court-approved wiretap.

38:09.958 --> 38:12.375
You wanted to know about
Beecher, now you know.

38:12.377 --> 38:14.761
- I'd let it go.
- Let it go?

38:14.763 --> 38:19.015
Fusco, do you know who gave
Beecher that tip?

38:19.017 --> 38:20.550
You'd have to ask him.

38:20.552 --> 38:22.819
Carter, Beecher could be walking
through a minefield.

38:22.821 --> 38:25.021
I'd be careful before I go
and follow him.

38:32.263 --> 38:33.446
He's carrying,
but he won't talk to me

38:33.448 --> 38:35.398
unless he sees I'm fit to buy.

38:35.400 --> 38:39.035
All right, when the deal's
done, I'll make the bust.

38:39.037 --> 38:41.705
If it goes right,
you can keep half.

38:44.992 --> 38:48.295
[Phone rings]

38:48.297 --> 38:51.381
- Beecher.
- Hey. You busy?

38:51.383 --> 38:53.300
On a job.

38:53.302 --> 38:56.086
When you're done,
buy you a drink?

38:56.088 --> 38:57.504
We need to talk.

38:57.506 --> 38:59.839
Yeah, okay.

38:59.841 --> 39:01.091
I'm in Washington Heights

39:01.093 --> 39:03.226
but could meet you back
at the Eighth.

39:03.228 --> 39:05.428
I'll wait for you.
[Click]

39:10.985 --> 39:12.986
Hey, hey!

39:28.002 --> 39:30.537
Donnie, what are you doing?

39:32.707 --> 39:35.508
- Yo, let me get clear.
- Clear of what?

39:37.295 --> 39:39.879
10-13, shots fired!
I repeat, shots fired!

39:41.048 --> 39:42.315
[Phone rings]

39:42.317 --> 39:44.551
- Carter.
- Detective,

39:44.553 --> 39:45.719
it's urgent that we reach

39:45.721 --> 39:47.270
Detective Beecher.
Is he with you?

39:47.272 --> 39:48.888
No. Why?

39:48.890 --> 39:50.607
Did you hear?
Officer in distress,

39:50.609 --> 39:52.559
Washington Heights.

39:52.561 --> 39:55.478
Washington Heights?
Cal!

40:24.975 --> 40:27.210
Cal.

40:36.020 --> 40:38.655
Come on, Carter.
Come on.

40:51.402 --> 40:53.569
Shocking news
out of Rylatech today.

40:53.571 --> 40:56.089
Police discovered the bodies
of CEO Martin Baxter

40:56.091 --> 40:58.878
and VP Ross Haskell in an
apparent murder-suicide when--

40:58.961 --> 41:01.211
Rylatech stock plunged
amid rumors of spies

41:01.213 --> 41:02.763
within the company's ranks.

41:02.765 --> 41:04.381
Federal investigators
have shut down operations

41:04.383 --> 41:06.016
and ordered
all Rylatech products

41:06.018 --> 41:07.467
at government sites
be immediately replaced.

41:07.469 --> 41:09.719
Further inquiries are pending.

41:11.122 --> 41:14.157
While we were off fighting
international espionage,

41:14.159 --> 41:17.293
things have gotten worse
in our own backyard.

41:17.295 --> 41:18.812
Whatever game Elias
is caught up in,

41:18.814 --> 41:21.464
it grows more dangerous
every day.

41:21.466 --> 41:24.134
Ms. Jacobs,
how are you doing?

41:24.136 --> 41:25.685
Oh, not bad, considering

41:25.687 --> 41:28.738
the company I devoted
the last ten years of my life to

41:28.740 --> 41:30.157
is under federal investigation.

41:30.159 --> 41:32.776
And, please, we breached
firewalls together.

41:32.778 --> 41:33.977
Call me Monica.

41:33.979 --> 41:35.862
So where will you go from here?

41:35.864 --> 41:37.647
Ah, I've had
some offers come in.

41:37.649 --> 41:38.982
Though the one
I'm most intrigued by

41:38.984 --> 41:40.834
is from a company called IFT.

41:40.836 --> 41:43.203
I think I've heard of them.

41:43.205 --> 41:46.423
They're doing some interesting
things in CPU architecture.

41:46.425 --> 41:49.259
Sounds like a good fit.
I wish you the best of luck.

41:49.261 --> 41:51.511
Take care, Monica.

41:51.513 --> 41:53.713
You too, Harold.

41:56.267 --> 42:00.103
You're gonna miss her,
aren't you, Finch?

42:00.105 --> 42:03.173
I would if I had time.

42:03.175 --> 42:07.811
As it is, there's a matter
that we need to discuss.

42:07.813 --> 42:10.497
The night we broke
into Rylatech,

42:10.499 --> 42:13.400
I recognized
some of the encrypted code

42:13.402 --> 42:14.784
in the spy's network.

42:14.786 --> 42:17.120
It had a signature

42:17.122 --> 42:20.407
similar to that virus
that Stanton uploaded.

42:20.409 --> 42:25.412
I was able to crack the virus's
code and learn two things.

42:25.414 --> 42:27.380
I'm all ears, Finch.

42:27.382 --> 42:29.716
First, only a fraction
of the stolen data

42:29.718 --> 42:31.251
made it
to the Chinese government.

42:31.253 --> 42:34.537
The rest went to another
organization.

42:34.539 --> 42:38.308
I believe they may have placed
the final call to Baxter.

42:38.310 --> 42:41.478
I dug further, but all I could
come up with was a name--

42:41.480 --> 42:44.064
Decima Technologies.

42:44.066 --> 42:46.216
And the second thing?

42:46.218 --> 42:49.736
Whoever Decima is,
I believe they created the virus

42:49.738 --> 42:52.405
to find and infect
a single target...

42:54.892 --> 42:57.994
the machine.

43:04.285 --> 43:09.072
Unfortunately, we've had
to pull up stakes in Rylatech.

43:09.074 --> 43:12.242
But, as expected,
the US is entirely focused

43:12.244 --> 43:14.761
on China's involvement
and not ours.

43:14.763 --> 43:19.032
Oh, one small wrinkle.
The breach of our

43:19.034 --> 43:21.584
encrypted network appears to be

43:21.586 --> 43:23.520
the work
of a single individual.

43:23.522 --> 43:25.922
I shall do
everything in my power

43:25.924 --> 43:30.310
to determine his identity
and render him irrelevant.

43:30.312 --> 43:32.595
Our larger operation

43:32.597 --> 43:36.566
is, of course,
still on schedule.
