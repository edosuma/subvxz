00:09.211 --> 00:11.835
( theme music playing )

00:43.919 --> 00:46.710
Sorry about that.
What do I owe you?

00:48.002 --> 00:50.294
Uh, 22.42.

00:50.294 --> 00:51.585
For one pizza?

00:51.585 --> 00:53.877
( laughs )
By God.

00:53.877 --> 00:55.835
Better be
goddamn delicious.

00:55.835 --> 00:58.211
Um, one second.

01:04.336 --> 01:07.211
Come on, wallet.

01:07.211 --> 01:10.668
I'm sorry, you could
come in and shut the door.
It's freezing out there.

01:24.252 --> 01:27.211
( sighs )
I'm sorry. Stupid wallet.
What's your name?

01:27.211 --> 01:29.460
- Jarod.
- Jarod.

01:29.460 --> 01:32.502
I am such a nincompoop.
( chuckles )

01:32.502 --> 01:36.294
So, you probably got, like,
a hundred pizzas in the car
that need delivering, right?

01:39.086 --> 01:42.835
Uh, no, it's fine.
Just, you know, need to
get back when I can.

01:42.835 --> 01:45.668
Man:
Right.
Come on, wallet. No!

01:45.668 --> 01:51.585
Wallet, wallet, wallet,
wallet, wallet, wallet,
wallet, wallet, wallet!

01:51.585 --> 01:53.752
Ah, two seconds.

01:53.752 --> 01:55.960
Make yourself at home.

01:55.960 --> 01:57.086
Um...

02:20.211 --> 02:21.919
Got it! All right.

02:21.919 --> 02:24.502
22-something--
son of a...

02:25.835 --> 02:27.460
- ( sighs )
- Oop.

02:27.460 --> 02:29.668
Perfect time
to run out of cash, right?

02:29.668 --> 02:32.169
Look at me wasting your time.
The prime of your youth.

02:32.169 --> 02:35.418
Sending you on a wild
goose chase for dollars
that don't exist.

02:35.418 --> 02:36.960
- It's fine.
- Man: Honey.

02:36.960 --> 02:39.002
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah. Do you have any cash?

02:39.002 --> 02:41.127
- You know I don't carry cash.
- I know you don't carry cash.

02:41.127 --> 02:44.460
Why would you carry cash
when you just take it from
my wallet whenever you need it?

02:44.460 --> 02:46.710
Um, all right, Jarod,
here's the deal.

02:46.710 --> 02:48.044
There's a cash machine
down the street.

02:48.044 --> 02:51.002
I will be back
in four minutes,
five tops.

02:51.002 --> 02:53.002
It's all right,
you can trust me.

02:53.002 --> 02:55.169
I'll even leave my wife
as collateral, all right?

02:55.169 --> 02:58.127
Um, you know, you can
just call a credit card in.

02:58.127 --> 03:01.044
No, no, no, that's silly
'cause then they tax your tip

03:01.044 --> 03:02.336
'cause you have to
declare it.

03:02.336 --> 03:04.002
Believe me,
I know the drill.

03:04.002 --> 03:05.835
- I'll be right back.
- It's really not that--

03:05.835 --> 03:07.835
honestly, the card...
( clears throat )

03:09.377 --> 03:11.668
Woman:
Can I get your help
with something?

03:16.002 --> 03:17.668
Sure.

03:17.668 --> 03:20.002
In here.

03:36.252 --> 03:38.044
Do you like
this dress?

03:39.835 --> 03:43.169
Uh, yes.

03:43.169 --> 03:45.627
( chuckles )
That rhymes.

03:45.627 --> 03:48.044
- What-- what rhymes?
- Yes, dress.

03:48.044 --> 03:49.835
Oh, yeah, mm-hmm.

03:49.835 --> 03:52.211
Yeah, it does, huh?
( inhales )

03:54.627 --> 03:56.211
Did you prefer
the other one?

03:58.418 --> 04:02.377
- What?
- Did you like the other dress
I was wearing before

04:02.377 --> 04:03.877
better than this one?

04:06.377 --> 04:08.044
Which-- which dress?

04:15.752 --> 04:17.585
You know, this one.

04:21.752 --> 04:23.418
( exhales )

04:23.418 --> 04:26.877
I, uh-- I don't know.
( sniffs )

04:26.877 --> 04:28.960
You don't know?

04:28.960 --> 04:31.127
Because you've never
seen it on me before?

04:34.377 --> 04:37.960
Or because you were
looking at my breasts
when I took it off

04:37.960 --> 04:41.668
and you didn't focus
on the dress?
( chuckles )

04:41.668 --> 04:43.919
- ( chuckles )
- That rhymes, too.

04:43.919 --> 04:47.418
- Breasts, dress.
- Yes. ( chuckles )

04:47.418 --> 04:49.252
Well, which is it?

04:52.044 --> 04:52.919
What?

04:54.543 --> 04:56.377
Okay, that's all
I needed.

04:56.377 --> 04:57.752
You can go now.

05:00.877 --> 05:02.835
If you want.

05:05.627 --> 05:08.418
( stammers )

05:08.418 --> 05:09.835
( clears throat )

05:11.377 --> 05:12.752
( exhales )

05:13.919 --> 05:16.418
I'm gonna try on
a third dress,

05:16.418 --> 05:18.336
but this time,
no peeking.

05:19.627 --> 05:21.086
Okay.

05:21.086 --> 05:22.752
- I said no peeking.
- I'm not!

05:22.752 --> 05:24.960
Ho dare you look at me.
Look away!

05:24.960 --> 05:27.252
- I am!
- Jarod!

05:28.460 --> 05:30.710
That's better.

05:30.710 --> 05:34.086
So long as
you're not looking,

05:34.086 --> 05:35.627
it's okay.

05:41.960 --> 05:44.169
( door closes )

05:55.294 --> 05:56.877
Do you want
some of that pizza?

05:56.877 --> 05:58.919
No, thanks.

05:58.919 --> 06:00.877
We're not
gonna eat it, so.

06:04.919 --> 06:07.044
If you're--
if you're not gonna eat it,

06:07.044 --> 06:10.127
why did you order it?

06:10.127 --> 06:13.002
- ( chuckles )
That's a good question.
- ( music playing on phone )

06:15.627 --> 06:17.211
It's not that
I don't like pizza.

06:21.002 --> 06:22.252
I love it.

06:24.044 --> 06:25.585
It's just...

06:26.960 --> 06:29.585
when all you ever have
is pizza...

06:31.044 --> 06:32.919
you get tired of it.

06:34.127 --> 06:36.336
Makes you want
something new.

06:37.502 --> 06:39.002
Something different.

06:45.294 --> 06:47.877
And your--
your husband,

06:47.877 --> 06:50.377
how does he feel
about pizza?

06:50.377 --> 06:54.835
I don't think
Scott's been hungry
in a long, long time.

06:54.835 --> 06:56.211
In fact...

06:57.710 --> 06:59.211
I don't think
Scott would notice

06:59.211 --> 07:01.752
if a nice piece of pizza
came right up and bit him.

07:03.960 --> 07:05.086
( chuckles )

07:07.336 --> 07:10.919
Must be weird delivering pizza
to all these strange people.

07:12.252 --> 07:14.460
Sometimes.

07:14.460 --> 07:18.127
Have you ever had
any strange encounters?

07:23.668 --> 07:25.418
Not really.

07:25.418 --> 07:29.377
Well, I have a hard time
believing that.

07:29.377 --> 07:31.543
A guy like you...

07:32.668 --> 07:35.418
Have you ever served pizza

07:35.418 --> 07:40.044
to, say, a woman
like me before?

07:43.294 --> 07:48.294
I-- I mean,
I've served pizza before.

07:48.294 --> 07:50.169
You have?

07:50.169 --> 07:52.502
Yeah.
Yeah, of course, yeah.

07:52.502 --> 07:54.502
How many times?

07:54.502 --> 07:57.294
Sure, uh...
( clears throat )

07:59.294 --> 08:02.127
A bunch.
A bunch of times.

08:03.794 --> 08:06.127
Interesting.

08:06.127 --> 08:08.044
Experienced.

08:08.044 --> 08:09.960
Yeah, a bunch of times.

08:11.377 --> 08:13.919
You haven't answered
my question.

08:13.919 --> 08:14.960
What question?

08:14.960 --> 08:18.377
Have you ever
served pizza

08:18.377 --> 08:20.919
to a woman like me
before?

08:27.169 --> 08:29.002
No, ma'am.

08:30.627 --> 08:32.627
So, here we are.

08:33.794 --> 08:36.044
So hungry.

08:37.585 --> 08:39.877
( exhales )

08:41.418 --> 08:44.668
Are you gonna bring me
that pizza or what?

08:47.960 --> 08:50.294
I want that pizza,
Jarod.

08:52.418 --> 08:54.336
I ordered that pizza,

08:54.336 --> 08:57.668
and now I'm ordering you
to bring me that pizza.

09:56.627 --> 09:58.460
- ( door thuds )
- Whew!

09:58.460 --> 10:01.127
- ( door closes )
- Damn, it is cold out there.

10:02.460 --> 10:04.252
Colder than
a witch's titty.

10:04.252 --> 10:08.044
Man!
But I got it.

10:08.044 --> 10:12.585
22-something
and a huge tip
for Jarod!

10:12.585 --> 10:15.794
Could you have taken
any longer, Scott?

10:15.794 --> 10:17.377
What?

10:17.377 --> 10:19.960
Wait, Jennifer,
where are you--
where are you--

10:19.960 --> 10:21.627
Jen, come back.

10:21.627 --> 10:23.086
Don't!

10:26.252 --> 10:29.502
- What did I say?
- ( blows raspberry )

10:29.502 --> 10:31.502
Jeez, I went to the ATM.
What...?

10:33.752 --> 10:37.169
I mean...
( sighs )

10:37.169 --> 10:39.835
( scoffing )

10:45.794 --> 10:47.252
Women, huh?

10:49.002 --> 10:52.002
( sighs )
You can't live
with 'em...

10:52.002 --> 10:53.794
Pass the Beer Nuts.

11:00.960 --> 11:03.169
You got a girlfriend,
Jarod?

11:05.377 --> 11:06.960
Uh, no, thanks.

11:06.960 --> 11:09.668
I-- I really gotta
get back to work.

11:09.668 --> 11:12.044
Yeah.
( chuckles )

11:12.044 --> 11:16.002
You two sure know
how to make a guy
feel good about himself.

11:16.002 --> 11:20.169
It's like I come in,
two seconds, you're
both running out

11:20.169 --> 11:22.169
quicker than two shakes
of a lamb's tail.

11:24.794 --> 11:26.418
I'm-- I'm sorry.
It's not personal.

11:26.418 --> 11:28.044
I just really gotta
get back to work.

11:28.044 --> 11:30.336
I'm kidding.
It's fine.

11:32.460 --> 11:34.336
( sighs )
It's fine.

11:39.169 --> 11:40.794
( clears throat )

11:43.877 --> 11:46.835
I do kind of need
the money for the pizza.

11:46.835 --> 11:49.502
( chuckles )

11:49.502 --> 11:52.086
Yes, money.

11:52.086 --> 11:54.252
22-something,
plus a tip,

11:54.252 --> 11:56.418
which should be sizable

11:56.418 --> 11:59.585
- considering we've been wasting
your time lollygagging.
- ( phone chimes )

11:59.585 --> 12:02.668
No, it's no problem.
Don't sweat it.
( sniffs )

12:02.668 --> 12:05.585
Ah, a text
from Jennifer.

12:05.585 --> 12:08.044
Probably apologizing
as we speak.

12:09.211 --> 12:10.377
Great.

12:19.002 --> 12:21.543
How big of a tip
were you expecting, Jarod?

12:23.877 --> 12:25.336
Excuse me?

12:26.710 --> 12:28.543
Just curious what you think
I should tip you.

12:29.877 --> 12:33.919
Just whatever you think
is appropriate is fine.

12:33.919 --> 12:36.211
Well, I guess
I don't-- I don't know
what's customary--

12:36.211 --> 12:39.044
- 10%, 20%?
- Sure, yeah,
either one.

12:39.044 --> 12:41.543
That'd-- that'd be great.
Thank you.

12:43.752 --> 12:47.794
I guess it would help if
I understood what services
you performed

12:47.794 --> 12:49.668
so that I can get
the amount right.

12:49.668 --> 12:53.418
I delivered the pizza.

12:53.418 --> 12:55.294
What kind of pizza?

12:57.543 --> 13:01.252
- ( swallows )
The meat lovers.
- Right, meat lovers.

13:01.252 --> 13:03.044
Right.

13:03.044 --> 13:05.877
Did you provide
any services for my wife
while I was gone?

13:09.418 --> 13:11.710
- Not really.
- Really?

13:14.211 --> 13:15.086
Nothing?

13:16.794 --> 13:19.127
Uh... no.

13:19.127 --> 13:22.127
'Cause it would seem to me
that the pizza,

13:22.127 --> 13:24.294
which was on the table
when I left,

13:24.294 --> 13:27.127
is now...
( whistles )

13:27.127 --> 13:30.336
on the bed instead.

13:30.336 --> 13:31.794
Huh.

13:31.794 --> 13:33.252
I guess...

13:33.252 --> 13:36.294
- that is--
- Hey, that rhymes.

13:38.211 --> 13:40.835
Instead, bed.

13:45.543 --> 13:49.294
Did you deliver
the meat lovers
to my wife on that bed?

13:52.086 --> 13:52.960
Sort of.

13:54.418 --> 13:55.835
Sort of?

13:59.336 --> 14:01.543
Jarod, I am no expert
in what you do,

14:01.543 --> 14:03.418
but it would
seem to me

14:03.418 --> 14:08.127
either you did or did not
serve my wife the meat lover

14:08.127 --> 14:10.044
on that bed.

14:15.460 --> 14:17.252
Gosh, I have gotta
get back to work.

14:17.252 --> 14:21.002
- I got so many
others to deliver.
- That would not be fair.

14:22.502 --> 14:23.960
I wanna pay you
for your services,

14:23.960 --> 14:25.919
I just need to know
what they were

14:25.919 --> 14:27.960
so that I can give you
the proper tip.

14:31.502 --> 14:34.336
- Can I just go home?
- Not until I tip you.

14:34.336 --> 14:36.668
( exhales )

14:36.668 --> 14:39.294
- All right.
- ( stammering )

14:39.294 --> 14:41.502
Let me
put it this way--

14:41.502 --> 14:44.252
how many times
did you fuck my wife?

14:46.835 --> 14:49.418
Oh-- oh, my gosh, sir.
I-- I did not.

14:49.418 --> 14:52.627
- I would never.
- What-- what are you saying,
my wife is ugly?

14:52.627 --> 14:54.502
- No, no.
- So, you're saying she's hot?

14:54.502 --> 14:56.336
No, I didn't say that.
I didn't say that.

14:56.336 --> 14:58.336
So, you just
fuck anything, then, right?
Is that your deal?

14:58.336 --> 15:01.668
You just go around
delivering meat lovers pizzas
willy-nilly wherever you go?

15:01.668 --> 15:03.543
No, no, no,
I did not say that.

15:03.543 --> 15:05.086
- Didn't do it a second time?
- I didn't do a first time.

15:05.086 --> 15:06.585
- Why not?
She didn't ask you?
- No.

15:06.585 --> 15:07.835
So, she asked you
to fuck her?

15:07.835 --> 15:10.377
Just give me
the number, Jarod.

15:10.377 --> 15:12.336
- Jarod!
- I didn't touch her! Ah!

15:12.336 --> 15:14.169
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Help!

15:14.169 --> 15:16.543
Help! Help! Ow!

15:16.543 --> 15:18.710
( grunting )
Help!

15:20.919 --> 15:22.960
( whimpering )

15:25.086 --> 15:26.336
Ah!

15:26.336 --> 15:27.960
( grunting )

15:29.294 --> 15:30.710
Help! Help!

15:30.710 --> 15:33.877
Oh, my God. Oh, fuck.
( panting )

15:33.877 --> 15:36.211
( groaning )

16:08.960 --> 16:11.169
In fact, I like you.
( chuckles )

16:11.169 --> 16:14.710
I mean, that's the whole
"you know" of it all

16:14.710 --> 16:18.294
is I liked you
from the second
I opened that door.

16:18.294 --> 16:19.585
So...

16:21.794 --> 16:23.585
I'm gonna make it easy
on you.

16:26.294 --> 16:28.627

you fucked my wife,

16:32.585 --> 16:33.668

- He told me everything.

17:47.377 --> 17:49.835
- What are you talking about?
- Don't you play dumb
with me, woman.

17:49.835 --> 17:52.543
I know about the sucking
and the fucking

17:52.543 --> 17:54.627

- Yeah!

17:59.710 --> 18:02.044
I leave the room

- No!

- ...I will let him go.
- Stop it! Enough!

18:37.252 --> 18:40.418
- ( exhales ) Thank you.
- You told him about us?

18:40.418 --> 18:41.377
What?

18:41.377 --> 18:43.044
How could you?

18:43.044 --> 18:45.086
Jarod:
I didn't--
I didn't say anything.

18:45.086 --> 18:47.877
That was special.
That was just for us.

18:47.877 --> 18:50.169
I didn't-- I didn't say a word.
I didn't tell him anything.

18:50.169 --> 18:52.460
- He's right, he didn't.
- There's nothing to tell!

18:52.460 --> 18:54.002
- I figured it out.
- Oh, my God.

18:54.002 --> 18:56.794
- I knew it.
- What do you expect, Scott?

18:56.794 --> 19:00.294
I expected you to honor
our marriage vows

19:00.294 --> 19:02.919
and not fuck
the first pizza boy
who came through the door!

19:02.919 --> 19:04.794
- You drove me to him!
- What?!

19:04.794 --> 19:07.627
- But nothing happened!
- I go to Pilates, I do yoga!

19:07.627 --> 19:11.127
- What? ( scoffs )
- I even went to that goddamn
facialist you recommended.

19:11.127 --> 19:13.960
- Again with the facialist!
- And you give me nothing!

19:13.960 --> 19:18.044

like a used veneer

from craigslist!

19:21.294 --> 19:24.002
Okay, Scott, Scott,
nothing happened, I swear.

19:24.002 --> 19:26.627
- You goddamn slut.
- You selfish son of a bitch.

19:26.627 --> 19:28.710
My mother told me
I was marrying a whore!

19:28.710 --> 19:31.377
- You treat me like dirt!
- Showing your titties
all over town!

19:31.377 --> 19:34.002
Now I'm gonna
make you pay for it!
( grunts )

19:34.002 --> 19:37.002

just needs to calm down.

Help!
Somebody help!

19:43.460 --> 19:46.377
- ( Jennifer gasps )
- There's one of those
slutty titties.

19:46.377 --> 19:47.794
See that, Jarod? Huh?

19:47.794 --> 19:49.377
- Wanna see the other one?
- No. No.

19:49.377 --> 19:51.336
- No!
- ( Jennifer grunts )

19:51.336 --> 19:53.002
- ( laughing )
- Oh, God.

19:53.002 --> 19:54.502
- Oh, God.
- There they are.

19:54.502 --> 19:55.668
Look at 'em.

19:55.668 --> 19:56.835
- Remember these, huh?
- No!

19:56.835 --> 19:58.252
Remember when
you fondled these titties

19:58.252 --> 19:59.502
and broke
my fragile heart?

19:59.502 --> 20:01.336
I never fondled
any titties. Help!

20:01.336 --> 20:03.377
It's 'cause you wanted Scott
all along, isn't it, Jarod?

20:03.377 --> 20:04.835
- Help! Wait.
- That's right.

20:04.835 --> 20:06.877
You used me to get
to Scott, didn't you?

20:06.877 --> 20:08.668
- No!
- Scott: Yeah!

20:08.668 --> 20:11.919
- Yeah, that's right.
- He used you to get to me.

20:11.919 --> 20:12.877
That's what happened.

20:14.169 --> 20:16.710
- Jennifer: Yeah.
- Help! Help!

20:16.710 --> 20:18.294
- Jarod: No!
- ( grunts )

20:18.294 --> 20:20.044
- ( whimpers )
- Over here, Jarod.

20:20.044 --> 20:21.877
- It's what you wanted.
- Scott: Look over here.

20:21.877 --> 20:23.627
- Here's your tip,
meat lover.
- No, thanks.

20:23.627 --> 20:25.086
- Look at me.
- Look at us, Jarod.

20:25.086 --> 20:26.835
- Look at Daddy.
- Help! Somebody help!

20:26.835 --> 20:29.418
- Look at Mommy!
Oh, my God!
- Please help!

20:29.418 --> 20:30.877
- Both: Oh, God!
- Oh, God.

20:30.877 --> 20:32.294
- Oh, God!
- ( moans )

20:32.294 --> 20:33.960
- ( moaning )
- Oh, God, oh, God!

20:33.960 --> 20:36.543
Oh, God! Oh, God!

20:45.710 --> 20:47.585
( music playing )

21:12.086 --> 21:15.627
That was not half bad
for your first time.

21:15.627 --> 21:17.169
( exhales )

21:17.169 --> 21:19.127
- Bill.
- Sir?

21:19.127 --> 21:21.919
You did a good job
of making me feel uneasy.

21:21.919 --> 21:23.460
( chuckles )

21:23.460 --> 21:25.835
Where you lost me was
in the characterization.

21:25.835 --> 21:28.294
I mean,
you started off as this
somewhat cosmopolitan weirdo

21:28.294 --> 21:32.502
and then digressed into this--
I mean, you tell me, buddy--
a Southern dad?

21:32.502 --> 21:34.294
It was all over the place.

21:34.294 --> 21:36.835
Yeah, I had trouble
finding the character.

21:36.835 --> 21:40.086
Make bold choices
and stick with them.

21:40.086 --> 21:42.502
- Yes, sir.
- Now, Lisa.

21:42.502 --> 21:44.794
( whistles )

21:44.794 --> 21:46.960
- Lisa, Lisa, Lisa.
- ( lighter clicking )

21:51.835 --> 21:53.960
We do have to talk
about those breasts.

21:55.627 --> 21:56.877
Sweetheart,
I've been to the Louvre,

21:56.877 --> 21:59.502
and those things
are the fucking Mona Lisa.

21:59.502 --> 22:01.252
Thank you.

22:01.252 --> 22:03.002
But I gotta say

22:03.002 --> 22:06.752
I think your choice
to show them to me so soon
after I came in the room,

22:06.752 --> 22:08.294
that was a mistake.

22:08.294 --> 22:10.336
'Cause here's
what you gotta understand--

22:10.336 --> 22:12.336
most of our clients--

22:12.336 --> 22:13.960
I mean, hell,
all our clients--

22:13.960 --> 22:15.294

22:15.294 --> 22:16.794
Okay?

22:16.794 --> 22:18.585
So, I mean, you're gonna
wanna hold that off

22:18.585 --> 22:22.835
for as long as you can.

22:22.835 --> 22:25.502
- That's your trump card.
- Yes, sir.

22:25.502 --> 22:26.502
Understood.

22:28.294 --> 22:30.585
Mm!

22:30.585 --> 22:32.002
Almost forgot.

22:34.336 --> 22:37.835
- What's this?
- I-- I thought this was
just an audition.

22:37.835 --> 22:39.835
Well, you worked hard.
You earned it.

22:41.919 --> 22:43.627
- All righty.
- Great.

22:43.627 --> 22:45.252
Get yourselves
