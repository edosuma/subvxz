22:59.400 --> 23:01.160
didn't ya?

23:02.120 --> 23:04.480
I didn't know.

23:04.560 --> 23:06.120
She...

23:06.200 --> 23:07.000
No, no, no, no.

23:07.080 --> 23:08.440
No!!!

23:08.520 --> 23:11.800
Rita! You knew!

23:11.880 --> 23:13.360
Rita?

23:21.480 --> 23:23.840
I knew.

23:23.920 --> 23:31.080
But I didn't find out
until after the trial.

23:31.160 --> 23:33.080
Yet, you didn't come forward.

23:33.160 --> 23:34.800
Why not?!

23:36.520 --> 23:41.840
Because I was protecting
my daughter.

23:41.920 --> 23:43.160
Finally.

23:45.680 --> 23:48.040
The truth.

23:56.400 --> 23:58.600
An important update now
to our breaking news story.

23:58.680 --> 24:00.760
Rita Gallo will be making
an announcement

24:00.840 --> 24:02.640
on her campaign website.

24:02.720 --> 24:04.440
We are being told that
it will be live streamed

24:04.520 --> 24:06.800
in about five minutes time.

24:06.880 --> 24:08.760
As we wait for Gallo's
statement,

24:08.840 --> 24:12.200
we will continue to monitor this active hostage situation.

24:15.280 --> 24:17.240
I do not feel good about this.

24:17.320 --> 24:21.760
Eden, this is
the command centre.

24:21.840 --> 24:24.560
These guys will explain
what's going on.

24:26.320 --> 24:29.080
I know this must be very
difficult for you, Miss Alcott.

24:29.160 --> 24:30.640
Thank you for coming down.

24:30.720 --> 24:34.160
My last name is Khouri now,
but call me Eden.

24:34.240 --> 24:36.160
I'm Cole Solomon, negotiator.

24:36.240 --> 24:37.880
This is staff sergeant,
Bill Chen.

24:37.960 --> 24:39.520
Head of the homicide unit.

24:39.600 --> 24:41.880
Are you up to answering
a few questions?

24:44.000 --> 24:45.360
Please.

24:46.560 --> 24:48.400
When was your last contact
with your father?

24:48.480 --> 24:50.680
My adoptive dad raised me.

24:50.760 --> 24:52.760
Grant Alcott is not my father.

24:52.840 --> 24:56.000
I understand Alcott called you
since his release.

24:56.080 --> 24:58.160
Please have a seat.

24:59.880 --> 25:01.400
I never picked up.

25:01.480 --> 25:04.640
He backed off for a while,
then started up again.

25:04.720 --> 25:06.080
I finally told him
if he kept calling,

25:06.160 --> 25:07.960
I would get a restraining order.

25:08.040 --> 25:11.240
Then he called from a blocked
number and left a voicemail.

25:11.320 --> 25:12.760
I still have it.

25:12.840 --> 25:16.320
It would be very helpful
if you played it for me.

25:23.720 --> 25:25.280
[Alcott] Eden?

25:25.360 --> 25:27.800
Uh, it's me again.

25:27.880 --> 25:31.280
This is my last call,
I swear.

25:31.360 --> 25:34.960
You're the best thing
that ever happened to me,

25:35.040 --> 25:37.480
I just want you to know that.

25:39.680 --> 25:43.240
Eden, there's an opportunity
to save two lives today.

25:43.320 --> 25:45.960
You're the best chance we have.

25:46.040 --> 25:49.680
We need you to talk to Grant.

25:49.760 --> 25:51.160
The man killed my mother.

25:51.240 --> 25:53.120
I'll be right there with you,
the whole time.

25:53.200 --> 25:57.200
Right by your side.

25:57.280 --> 25:58.560
Can I think it over?

25:58.640 --> 26:01.400
I'm afraid not.

26:01.480 --> 26:04.000
We're running out of time,
Eden.

26:05.040 --> 26:07.080
I'm sorry.

26:22.720 --> 26:24.280
[laughs coldly]
Values.

26:24.360 --> 26:27.160
That's not the Rita Gallo
I know.

26:27.240 --> 26:29.920
Probably not the one you know,
either.

26:30.000 --> 26:31.560
I know her.

26:31.640 --> 26:33.840
You think you do.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.040
You're on.

26:41.760 --> 26:44.040
My name is Rita Gallo.

26:44.120 --> 26:47.280
As a former lawyer who
prosecuted many cases,

26:47.360 --> 26:50.040
I believe in a strong criminal justice system.

26:50.120 --> 26:53.200
However, sometimes this justice system fails,

26:53.280 --> 26:56.960
especially when those in power choose to ignore the truth.

26:57.040 --> 26:59.080
As a member of the law society,

26:59.160 --> 27:02.640
I have taken an oath promising to honour and protect

27:02.720 --> 27:05.840
the rights of the people
of this country.

27:05.920 --> 27:08.240
I have broken this promise.

27:08.320 --> 27:12.200
Years ago, I was involved in a trial where mistakes were made.

27:12.280 --> 27:14.800
I failed to speak the truth,
and remained silent

27:14.880 --> 27:18.120
about crucial facts during
the criminal investigation

27:18.200 --> 27:21.720
of a case I oversaw.

27:21.800 --> 27:25.920
In their zeal to convict
Grant Alcott,

27:26.000 --> 27:28.560
homicide detectives cut corners.

27:28.640 --> 27:31.360
This'll blow back all over
the department.

27:31.440 --> 27:34.720
It's time this became
public knowledge.

27:37.000 --> 27:41.040
The fact that steps were taken
to influence the outcome

27:41.120 --> 27:43.600
of the trial is the biggest
concern to me

27:43.680 --> 27:47.320
as a former officer
of the court.

27:47.400 --> 27:49.560
As a wife and a mother,

27:51.680 --> 27:54.520
I have a more personal regret
for my behaviour.

27:56.440 --> 28:00.960
My former husband,
Detective Anthony Jameson,

28:01.040 --> 28:03.880
the lead investigator
on the case,

28:03.960 --> 28:06.640
crossed an ethical line.

28:08.240 --> 28:13.320
He stood by as his partner
relocated the murder weapon.

28:20.280 --> 28:24.520
It is my life's biggest regret
that I did not come forward

28:24.600 --> 28:29.440
with this information as soon
as it came to my attention.

28:44.600 --> 28:47.240
Okay, we're ready.

28:50.240 --> 28:51.960

Hi.

29:14.880 --> 29:17.040
Are you all right?

29:17.120 --> 29:18.640
Yeah.

29:18.720 --> 29:21.840
Now that I'm talking
to you, yeah.

29:21.920 --> 29:24.560
It's so good to hear
your voice.

29:26.560 --> 29:29.920
Such a long time, I've really
missed talking to you.

29:33.080 --> 29:36.080
I left you messages,
did you listen to them?

29:37.840 --> 29:41.640
Yes, Dad I have.

29:41.720 --> 29:44.480
I've been thinking about
your voicemail, Dad.

29:44.560 --> 29:47.240
We can work things out,
but we have to talk.

29:47.320 --> 29:50.360
Face to face.

29:50.440 --> 29:55.680
I can't do it,
I can't do that.

29:55.760 --> 29:57.440
Please.

29:57.520 --> 29:59.360
Do it for me.

29:59.440 --> 30:01.080
Eden.

30:02.880 --> 30:09.320
I'm really sorry
about everything.

30:16.800 --> 30:20.680
You'll always be my father,
no matter what happened.

30:20.760 --> 30:23.160
Come out and talk to me.

30:28.680 --> 30:31.600
Wait... What?

30:31.680 --> 30:33.800
Where are you?

30:35.320 --> 30:36.520
Grant.

30:36.600 --> 30:37.760
Grant, are you still there?

30:37.840 --> 30:39.760
You dragged my daughter
down here?

30:39.840 --> 30:41.880
She loves you, Grant.

30:41.960 --> 30:44.520
She wants to work things out.

30:45.920 --> 30:47.360
[slams laptop]

30:50.520 --> 30:53.160
Grant. Grant.

30:53.240 --> 30:55.280
Grant, you still there?

30:55.360 --> 30:56.680
That's a lie.

30:56.760 --> 30:58.080
You've been coaching her.

30:58.160 --> 31:00.200
It's all a lie.

what's happening?

31:14.640 --> 31:16.240
Zulu 14, I've lost visual
contact.

31:16.320 --> 31:17.920
-No movement out back.
-No movement inside.

into this.

If you do this,
there's no turning back.

You. You're coming with me.

31:31.720 --> 31:33.320

how this will affect her

31:33.400 --> 31:35.080

to a violent death.

31:41.040 --> 31:43.600
Don't make her go through
it again.

31:43.680 --> 31:44.960
Just go and talk to her.

31:45.040 --> 31:46.560
It's a trap.

31:46.640 --> 31:48.800
She wouldn't have talked to you
if she didn't care.

31:48.880 --> 31:50.360
Sit down.

31:53.280 --> 31:55.960
Say goodbye.

31:56.040 --> 31:57.480

36:02.920 --> 36:05.760
Just stick around
until you finish your debrief.

36:08.800 --> 36:10.440
You'll be okay.

36:24.480 --> 36:26.200
You wanna go for breakfast?

36:26.280 --> 36:28.680
Like friends do?

36:28.760 --> 36:30.320
You wanna go, or not?

36:30.400 --> 36:32.080
I do, but I gotta stop
by my mom's.

36:32.160 --> 36:33.800
See how she's doing.

36:33.880 --> 36:34.920
Rain check?

36:35.000 --> 36:36.400
Next time I'm feeling friendly.

36:36.480 --> 36:37.800
I won't hold my breath.

36:37.880 --> 36:38.960
You still owe me a coffee.

36:39.040 --> 36:42.400
That was a one-time deal.

36:42.480 --> 36:44.840
You all right to drive?

36:44.920 --> 36:48.240
Probably not, but I don't
want to leave my truck here.

36:50.840 --> 36:52.160
Your baby.

36:52.240 --> 36:53.480
It's a one-time deal.

36:53.560 --> 36:55.080
Uh-huh.

37:15.120 --> 37:17.840
Not only did you jeopardize
the entire operation,

37:17.920 --> 37:20.840
you put yourself and
your mother at risk.

37:20.920 --> 37:23.200
I wasn't thinking about
the repercussions.

37:23.280 --> 37:25.320
I was thinking about my mom.

37:25.400 --> 37:29.120
I'm well aware of that.

37:29.200 --> 37:30.600
You know I've always been
in your corner,

37:30.680 --> 37:33.840
and man, you show a lot
of promise.

37:33.920 --> 37:37.080
But I seriously question
your judgement.

37:41.680 --> 37:43.080
No, no, no.

37:43.160 --> 37:46.560
Don't bother with the
"take my badge" theatre.

37:46.640 --> 37:50.080
Word came down from above.

37:50.160 --> 37:53.320
The media saved your ass.

37:53.400 --> 37:55.120
And if the public
gets their way,

37:55.200 --> 37:58.560
the chief will be giving you
a commendation.

38:03.520 --> 38:07.040
I hope you'll give me the chance
to earn back your trust.

38:09.760 --> 38:12.840
How's Rita doing?

38:12.920 --> 38:16.280
She's gonna win.

38:16.360 --> 38:18.520
Of course she is.

38:23.520 --> 38:24.960
Kate.

38:27.800 --> 38:32.360
That stunt you pulled...

38:32.440 --> 38:35.840
your old man would've done
the exact same thing.

38:40.480 --> 38:42.720
That story about my dad,
and Huntley,

38:42.800 --> 38:43.760
and the evidence...

38:43.840 --> 38:46.080
All that died with them.

38:48.600 --> 38:51.160
Your dad was a good cop.

38:51.240 --> 38:57.360
That's how I choose
to remember him.

38:57.440 --> 39:00.320
I suggest you do the same.

39:04.480 --> 39:08.240
No more theatrics, okay?

39:39.440 --> 39:40.960
I thought you were supposed
to win the election

39:41.040 --> 39:44.400
before you start packing
for the mayor's office.

39:44.480 --> 39:45.680
You got my message.

39:45.760 --> 39:47.280
You sounded upset.

39:47.360 --> 39:48.920
I'm dropping out of the race.

39:49.000 --> 39:50.600
What?

39:50.680 --> 39:52.520
Mom...

39:53.560 --> 39:55.560
I don't have it
in me anymore.

39:55.640 --> 39:57.320
You're five points up
in the polls.

39:57.400 --> 40:00.120
Sympathy votes, because my
campaign manager was murdered.

40:00.200 --> 40:01.880
David would've wanted you
to win.

40:01.960 --> 40:06.240
Yeah, well, he's not here
to share that opinion, is he?

40:09.000 --> 40:13.120
First your father,
now David.

40:13.200 --> 40:15.200
I can't.

40:17.160 --> 40:19.520
I don't want it anymore.

40:21.480 --> 40:23.280
[sighs]

40:26.080 --> 40:28.920
My career has been
at the expense

40:29.000 --> 40:31.920
of everything else in my life.

40:32.000 --> 40:39.200
My marriage, friendships,
my relationship with you.

40:39.280 --> 40:42.080
I can't let that happen again.

40:44.080 --> 40:46.040
[sighs]

40:47.160 --> 40:49.560
But you also can't stop being
who you are.

40:49.640 --> 40:52.520
Your whole life has been
about public service,

40:52.600 --> 40:55.080
about making a difference,

40:55.160 --> 40:56.680
and now you've got a chance
to have an impact

40:56.760 --> 41:00.680
on the whole city.

41:00.760 --> 41:04.080
Look, the election is only
a few days away.

41:04.160 --> 41:06.480
Let the voters decide.
