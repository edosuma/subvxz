WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:00.320
.

00:05.720 --> 00:09.320
The Geordies are back. We're leaving
the Toon and hitting Greece.

00:10.160 --> 00:12.680
Greece, you're about to get done.

00:12.760 --> 00:14.520
(cheering)

00:14.600 --> 00:16.080
Come on!

00:17.520 --> 00:19.120
It's gonna be pool parties...

00:19.200 --> 00:20.960
Boat parties...

00:21.760 --> 00:22.880
More drama.

00:24.280 --> 00:25.600
Fuck this shit!

00:27.440 --> 00:29.240
More tashing on.

00:31.440 --> 00:33.000
More fucking tragedy.

00:34.280 --> 00:35.280
Slag!

00:35.360 --> 00:36.720
(shouting)

00:36.800 --> 00:38.320
(exhales heavily)

00:38.400 --> 00:40.880
Don't fucking ever
speak to me again.

00:40.960 --> 00:42.000
(sobbing)

00:42.080 --> 00:44.040
(spits)

00:44.120 --> 00:45.640
Total carnage.

00:48.320 --> 00:50.520
Fuck! Shit! What have I done now?

00:53.760 --> 00:55.560
And a shitload of bucking, like.

00:58.680 --> 01:03.240
Greece, the Geordie gods are coming.
Time to get immortal.

01:08.280 --> 01:11.440
Anna wants me to go and sit on a boat
and play happy families

01:11.520 --> 01:14.200
after last night. What the fuck?

01:14.280 --> 01:17.720
Angry ex, cramped boat. That's not
gonna be awkward at all, like.

01:17.800 --> 01:21.000
(Charlotte)The boy/girl divide
is bigger than ever.

01:21.080 --> 01:22.200
To the boys.

01:22.280 --> 01:25.720
It's between Holly and Kyle.
Everyone else should be getting on.

01:29.360 --> 01:32.360
We get back and we decide
to play "Who do you fancy"?

01:32.440 --> 01:35.440
Marns, I'm not gonna lie.
All I'm gonna say is, "snap".

01:36.520 --> 01:38.720
All of us are actually getting on.

01:42.520 --> 01:44.240
Why do they always kill the mood?

01:47.280 --> 01:50.680
It's not the boys vs the girls,
it's Holly and Kyle vs us.

01:51.480 --> 01:53.280
I don't wanna hear Holly moaning.

01:53.360 --> 01:55.880
Me and Chloe will find
somewhere else to sleep.

01:55.960 --> 01:58.480
(mutters) Stop it now.

01:58.560 --> 02:01.800
Charlotte has got her tits out.
Really?

02:03.680 --> 02:05.880
I should have a degree
in pulling women.

02:05.960 --> 02:08.440
I'd never kiss anyone
without a six pack.

02:08.520 --> 02:11.000
I'm a natural beauty.
Real boobs, real hair.

02:11.080 --> 02:13.080
I'm gonna tear the place up.

02:13.160 --> 02:15.360
I'm totally crackers, me, like.

02:15.440 --> 02:17.080
I'm preened to perfection.

02:17.160 --> 02:19.280
I'm cheeky and full of mischief.

02:19.360 --> 02:21.120
I'm fit, flirty and I've got FFs.

02:21.200 --> 02:23.520
I'm gonna make sparks fly.

02:23.600 --> 02:25.960
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

02:32.120 --> 02:35.680
(Holly) Whoa. Hang on a minute.
Gary's in bed with me.

02:35.760 --> 02:37.920
I don't remember him being here.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.400
Why the fuck are you here?

02:39.480 --> 02:43.480
Last night, Chloe and Charlotte
were both giggling on the bed.

02:43.560 --> 02:47.760
Charlotte, like, unzipped her top
and Chloe just pulled it up.

02:47.840 --> 02:49.080
They were necking on.

02:49.160 --> 02:51.160
Last night, I was nearly asleep

02:51.240 --> 02:54.560
and Charlotte and Chloe
decided to give us a live sex show.

02:54.640 --> 02:58.080
And I was, like, "Look, Gaz,
just get yourself out of the room."

03:00.760 --> 03:02.080
Yeah, definitely.

03:02.160 --> 03:06.720
The mad thing is, the old Gaz would
have fucking destroyed both of them.

03:06.800 --> 03:08.680
Are you all right after last night?

03:08.760 --> 03:13.200
It was such a nice place and then
it just... it just got ruined.

03:13.280 --> 03:15.840
Last night I ended up in tears
over Kyle.

03:15.920 --> 03:18.200
I don't know when this is gonna end.

03:18.280 --> 03:22.520
I'm with him 24/7.
I'm on a fucking boat with him.

03:22.600 --> 03:25.440
Holly and Kyle had another argument
last night.

03:25.520 --> 03:27.320
I don't really care what she does.

03:27.400 --> 03:30.480
She needs to sort it out
because everybody is fed up of it.

03:33.760 --> 03:35.440
(laughs)

03:35.520 --> 03:39.560
Me and Chloe were just looking for
somewhere to sleep last night

03:39.640 --> 03:41.760
and then one thing led to another.

03:41.840 --> 03:44.840
Oh, my God, did we scissor?

03:46.240 --> 03:48.360
No, I definitely didn't finger ya.

03:48.440 --> 03:52.360
Last night my lesbian charm
worked again on Charlotte.

03:52.440 --> 03:54.280
She was all over us like a rash.

03:56.280 --> 03:57.440
What a surprise.

03:57.520 --> 04:02.280
Last night the Kyle and Holly
situation was annoying everyone.

04:02.360 --> 04:05.080
I mean, they weren't even supposed
to be talking,

04:05.160 --> 04:07.240
so God knows
how they ended up arguing.

04:07.320 --> 04:10.440
I'm sick. I'm literally...
I'm not getting involved.

04:10.520 --> 04:12.400
I literally don't care any more.

04:12.480 --> 04:14.800
Charlotte is absolutely sick
of Holly.

04:14.880 --> 04:17.400
I've never heard her talk
about her like this.

04:17.480 --> 04:19.480
Holly is gonna have no-one soon.

04:21.400 --> 04:23.200
Santorini has been pure wicked,

04:23.280 --> 04:25.960
but Captain Zachary needs
to spin this ship around

04:26.040 --> 04:27.400
and take wuh back to Ios.

04:27.480 --> 04:30.160
(all) Ios! Ios! Ios!

04:36.400 --> 04:40.280
We're back in Ios now.
We wanna go out and do some fun.

04:41.040 --> 04:44.000
Scott and Aaron are asking
if I wanna go cliff diving.

04:44.080 --> 04:46.240
To be honest,
I wanna jump off a cliff.

04:46.320 --> 04:49.680
Fucking get your shit together,
then.

04:49.760 --> 04:52.120
It'll be good for Holly
to get away from Kyle.

04:52.200 --> 04:54.560
Let's get off this boat.
It's gonna be sick.

04:56.840 --> 04:59.840
We get to this cliff.
These lot are shitting themselves,

04:59.920 --> 05:02.440
so it looks like Scotty T
is going in balls first.

05:06.720 --> 05:08.400
Oh, my God!

05:09.440 --> 05:10.840
(screams)

05:13.640 --> 05:15.480
Why the fuck are we doing this?

05:17.800 --> 05:20.640
It is so high.
I'm never gonna be able to do this.

05:22.160 --> 05:23.320
Do I?

05:24.080 --> 05:27.960
It's not like she's gonna drown.
Not with them buoys on her chest.

05:33.480 --> 05:36.200
Holly is so much better
when she's not around Kyle.

05:36.280 --> 05:38.000
If he had have been here today,

05:38.080 --> 05:41.160
there's no chance she would
have jumped off that cliff.

05:42.240 --> 05:44.320
(Scott)Cliff diving was lethal.

05:44.400 --> 05:47.720
It's time to get back to the boat
and get wrecked in Ios tonight.

05:58.280 --> 05:59.280
(chokes)

05:59.360 --> 06:03.600
We're getting ready for tonight and
I'm actually looking forward to it.

06:03.680 --> 06:07.320
I just hope Kyle and Holly
don't spoil it once again.

06:13.760 --> 06:15.840
You won't, though.
Yes, I fucking will.

06:15.920 --> 06:18.840
I know what you're trying to say,
but you care about her.

06:18.920 --> 06:21.400
You don't love her.
She's gonna get confused.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.240
I cannot speak to these lads
about love.

06:27.320 --> 06:28.840
All they know is pulling.

06:28.920 --> 06:32.360
Right, lads! We wanna go out now!

06:32.440 --> 06:34.840
Chloe, you look so sophisticated
tonight.

06:34.920 --> 06:37.600
Thank you.
You look like a gorgeous woman.

06:37.680 --> 06:39.160
Thank you.
A grown up.

06:39.240 --> 06:40.520
Thank you.

06:40.600 --> 06:44.120
The girls are fighting over us
cos I look like an elegant swan,

06:44.200 --> 06:46.720
but tonight I'm going for a boy.
Sorry, girls.

06:46.800 --> 06:51.360
Think you could pull Scotty tonight?
I'd rather just pull my own boy.

06:51.440 --> 06:55.040
I'm trying to play it cool,
saying that I don't wanna bang Scott.

06:55.120 --> 06:56.920
But I do. A lot.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.040
Need you to try not to cry tonight.
I did that last night.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.000
I don't wanna speak with him.

07:02.080 --> 07:06.480
I'm not gonna speak to Kyle tonight.
It only ever ends in disaster.

07:06.560 --> 07:09.640
Party squad.
The bar over here called Slammers.

07:09.720 --> 07:12.240
We'll go there first
and hit the club after.

07:12.320 --> 07:16.000
I'm excited for tonight. It's gonna
be big. Let's get out of here.

07:20.520 --> 07:22.240
So we go to a bar called Slammers.

07:22.320 --> 07:25.120
You walk in, have a shot,
get whacked over the head.

07:25.200 --> 07:28.680
That sounds like a normal night out
with the girls.

07:28.760 --> 07:29.960
It's Aaron first up.

07:30.040 --> 07:32.280
Oi, barman, don't hold back, mate.

07:37.560 --> 07:40.240
Fucking hell, mate. That was wicked.

07:42.240 --> 07:43.760
Fucking hell!

07:43.840 --> 07:46.080
I'm a bit nervous about getting hit.

07:46.160 --> 07:48.240
Last time I did that,
I lost me marbles.

07:48.320 --> 07:50.680
To be honest,
I haven't got much left to lose.

07:52.080 --> 07:55.320
Fucking hell!
That's two more marbles gone.

08:02.560 --> 08:03.800
Slammers was mint.

08:03.880 --> 08:06.480
I'm kinda pissed.
Let's get this party started.

08:15.040 --> 08:17.000
Tonight is going amazing.

08:17.080 --> 08:20.040
There's a smile on everyone's face.

08:20.120 --> 08:21.400
Even Holly and Kyle's.

08:27.480 --> 08:30.680
I find myself a canny lass
and I'm getting a bit of a neck on.

08:30.760 --> 08:31.920
Wicked fucking kick.

08:33.400 --> 08:36.840
Me and Scott have had a look around
and we've pulled two fit birds.

08:36.920 --> 08:38.600
Standard procedure.

08:39.920 --> 08:41.360
Scott might have pulled,

08:41.440 --> 08:44.680
but I'm gonna make him aware
that I'm still in the building.

08:44.760 --> 08:47.520
Do you like me arse, Scott?
Very big, isn't it?

08:49.480 --> 08:52.520
I don't know what Chloe's doing
in front of me bird,

08:52.600 --> 08:54.640
but if she's trying to show us
her arse,

08:54.720 --> 08:57.080
I could have seen it from the boat.

09:05.560 --> 09:09.040
Me and Holly are not meant to be
speaking, but now we're flirting,

09:09.120 --> 09:12.760
and I know everyone in the house
is gonna be pissed off with us.

09:12.840 --> 09:14.480
But that's not gonna stop us.

09:17.200 --> 09:19.440
It's so weird
with me and Kyle right now.

09:19.520 --> 09:22.200
Everything that we're doing
feels so right.

09:22.280 --> 09:25.840
In the back of my mind, I know that
it's so wrong, but I can't stop.

09:28.120 --> 09:31.720
Every day Kyle comes and talks to me
about this whole situation.

09:31.800 --> 09:34.600
It's pissing us off.
He knows Holly still likes him.

09:34.680 --> 09:36.400
Flirting with her in the club

09:36.480 --> 09:39.040
is gonna lead
to another fucking argument.

09:42.320 --> 09:45.480
I'm so pissed and I'm just trying
to get Scott's attention.

09:55.320 --> 09:58.520
Chloe's launching ice at us.
Babe, there's no fucking need.

09:58.600 --> 10:00.320
Me drink's cool enough.

10:02.240 --> 10:04.280
Chloe's taking it a step too far.

10:06.080 --> 10:07.720
Now Kyle's in me face.

10:07.800 --> 10:11.280
Shouldn't you be concentrating
on fucking pissing Holly off?

10:16.760 --> 10:20.360
Marnie hasn't a clue what's going on
and she's just got up in me face.

10:26.920 --> 10:30.800
Who the fuck does Kyle think he is?
If Chloe has thrown ice or not,

10:30.880 --> 10:33.360
he is the last person
to tell her what to do.

10:35.920 --> 10:37.080
Chloe's in the wrong.

10:37.160 --> 10:40.480
I don't care what Kyle's done,
I'm not letting him take the rap.

10:42.600 --> 10:45.040
I can't believe
that Holly's defending Kyle.

10:45.120 --> 10:49.200
Kyle wasn't defending her when
he was getting other girls' numbers.

10:49.280 --> 10:54.160
I'm really glad Holly's got me back.
I was just trying to protect Chloe.

11:00.760 --> 11:04.000
Tonight has been weird.
Holly and Kyle defending each other.

11:04.080 --> 11:06.360
Scott's got a bird.
Chloe's kicking off.

11:06.440 --> 11:08.200
Let's just get back to the boat.

11:12.960 --> 11:15.320
Me and Scott are going back
to the boat alone

11:15.400 --> 11:17.680
because Chloe is being
an absolute dick.

11:23.800 --> 11:27.120
I've had a wicked night.
Let's carry on the fun.

11:33.360 --> 11:34.560
I've had a mint night

11:34.640 --> 11:38.640
and I'm finding it really difficult
to keep me hands off Holly.

11:42.240 --> 11:45.840
Me and Kyle can't help ourselves.
We're still flirting.

11:45.920 --> 11:47.880
It's so confusing for me.

11:47.960 --> 11:49.960
Oh, you look so cute!

11:50.040 --> 11:51.680
No, no, no!

11:53.520 --> 11:55.840
(both laugh)

11:55.920 --> 11:58.760
I walk in on Kyle and Holly.
Are they fucking stupid?

11:58.840 --> 12:01.960
Is everything they just told us
a complete joke or what?

12:02.040 --> 12:05.320
Listen, I have just literally
just walked in the shag pad.

12:05.400 --> 12:07.160
Kyle and Holly, laughing.

12:11.960 --> 12:14.280
Are you having a fucking laugh?

12:14.360 --> 12:17.480
Holly and Kyle are in the shag pad
after everything.

12:17.560 --> 12:19.960
I have fucking had it up to here
with them two.

12:23.840 --> 12:27.920
I'm not surprised. I'm just
a little bit disappointed in Holly.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.680
If they try to talk to me
about their problems,

12:30.760 --> 12:33.520
I'm just gonna go,
"Fuck off. Fucking suck me dick."

12:33.600 --> 12:36.840
Cuddling with Holly is only
gonna fuck with her emotions.

12:36.920 --> 12:40.680
It's gonna end up her crying and we
cannot be arsed with that any more.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.320
This Holly and Kyle thing
just gets worse. Fucking worse.

12:45.400 --> 12:48.760
I can't even be arsed to talk about
it any more. I'm going to bed.

12:50.280 --> 12:51.520
Bye, Kyle.

12:51.600 --> 12:55.040
It's really, really difficult to do,
but I know I've gotta do it.

12:55.120 --> 12:58.800
I've got to go to my own bed, as much
as I just wanna stay with him.

13:06.960 --> 13:10.320
I was in bed by myself.
Yeah, well...

13:10.400 --> 13:13.320
I was in bed with the girls.
All right.

13:13.400 --> 13:16.320
But something bad happened again.

13:16.400 --> 13:17.760
What is that?

13:21.000 --> 13:22.560
Oh, my God. It's piss.

13:22.640 --> 13:25.120
Have you pissed?
No.

13:25.200 --> 13:28.960
So Charlotte's decided to piss the
bed when me and Chloe were in it.

13:29.040 --> 13:30.920
Fuck's sake, Charlotte!

13:31.000 --> 13:34.200
Last night was funny, for once.

13:34.280 --> 13:36.440
In the whole time
that we've been here,

13:36.520 --> 13:39.520
all the drama
wasn't revolved around us.

13:39.600 --> 13:41.640
Last night was absolutely amazing.

13:41.720 --> 13:43.840
Me and Kyle
were getting along so well.

13:43.920 --> 13:45.960
I can't believe
we're friends again.

13:46.040 --> 13:48.160
Even though, secretly,
I do want more.

13:48.240 --> 13:51.200
I know yous were in the bedroom.
We didn't do anything.

13:51.280 --> 13:54.640
We were touching knees. I was, like,
"Ah, get your knee off me."

13:54.720 --> 13:56.120
But that's flirting.

13:56.200 --> 13:59.200
Holly and Kyle were so close again
last night.

13:59.280 --> 14:02.240
Nothing good
is ever gonna come of this.

14:05.080 --> 14:07.000
There's a dark cloud above the boat,

14:07.080 --> 14:09.480
and it's got Holly and Kyle's name
all over it.

14:12.760 --> 14:17.120
Kyle walks in and no-one can even
bring themselves to talk to him.

14:18.200 --> 14:20.800
Right, kid. Do you wanna bring it up
or should we?

14:20.880 --> 14:23.320
What the fuck were you playing at
last night?

14:26.880 --> 14:28.880
We were actually getting on.

14:33.640 --> 14:37.240
I don't know why the lads are so
upset with me and Holly getting on.

14:37.320 --> 14:39.240
For once, that girl had a good night.

14:48.640 --> 14:52.200
I can't even be arsed to sit
and listen to Kyle's shit any more,

14:52.280 --> 14:54.760
so me and the boys
are off to sunbathe.

14:54.840 --> 14:57.280
I understand the girls
taking Holly's side,

14:57.360 --> 14:59.200
but now the boys are kicking off.

14:59.280 --> 15:03.240
What am I meant to fucking do,
not speak to her? Fuck off.

15:03.320 --> 15:06.520
(groans) Man.

15:09.800 --> 15:12.760
Any of yous fancy doing something?
It's a lush day.

15:12.840 --> 15:15.080
Let's go to the beach,
frolic and shit.

15:15.160 --> 15:18.560
I'm sick of this boat and me balls
could do with a good breeze,

15:18.640 --> 15:21.160
so me and the squad
are off to the beach.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.200
Look, nude.

15:23.280 --> 15:25.640
Soz. Did I not mention
it was a nudist beach?

15:25.720 --> 15:28.080
Get your fucking choppers out, lads.

15:28.880 --> 15:31.640
The last thing I wanna do,
feeling this hungover,

15:31.720 --> 15:33.320
is see all their ball sacs.

15:33.400 --> 15:36.920
I'm not getting naked.
I'll get my bum out.

15:37.000 --> 15:40.240
It doesn't take me two seconds.
My fucking pants are off.

15:40.320 --> 15:42.240
I'm going in, butt naked.

15:43.240 --> 15:45.400
Nathan must be proper buzzing.

15:45.480 --> 15:48.040
It's like all of his Christmases
came at once.

15:51.200 --> 15:53.560
I feel like a naked ringleader.

15:53.640 --> 15:56.160
I'm in the sea
and all the boys are following.

15:56.240 --> 15:58.080
I enjoy this... a lot.

15:58.160 --> 16:03.160
Aaron! It's the only part that Aaron
actually hasn't got tattoos on.

16:08.280 --> 16:10.760
Gary and Scott are dick slapping us.

16:10.840 --> 16:13.840
I'm pretending that I'm shy.
Secretly, it's made my day.

16:15.200 --> 16:16.960
I don't think it's the best idea,

16:17.040 --> 16:19.840
the boys slapping their cocks
around Nathan's head.

16:19.920 --> 16:21.560
Considering he's bisexual,

16:21.640 --> 16:24.280
he might just open his mouth
and one might fall in.

16:24.360 --> 16:26.360
That would be pretty awkward.

16:31.840 --> 16:34.080
Despite getting on so well
last night,

16:34.160 --> 16:36.840
me and Holly
still need to talk sober.

16:36.920 --> 16:38.680
Where do I begin? (sighs)

16:38.760 --> 16:41.320
Kyle's been a dick,
but after last night,

16:41.400 --> 16:44.440
something inside of me
just doesn't think it's the end.

16:44.520 --> 16:47.440
Last night, I felt it was back
to when we first met.

16:47.520 --> 16:50.120
Deep down, I do hope
that we can get back together.

16:53.200 --> 16:55.600
That was wrong,
what we done last night.

16:55.680 --> 16:58.400
That'll be leading you on.
I shouldn't do that.

16:58.480 --> 17:02.040
I wanna do what the lads are doing.
I wanna go off and I wanna...

17:02.120 --> 17:06.720
Just... be...
Just say it. Say you wanna pull.

17:10.960 --> 17:13.600
Our relationship wasn't working

17:13.680 --> 17:17.520
and we argued every night
for pointless reasons.

17:17.600 --> 17:19.120
I'm too young to settle down.

17:19.200 --> 17:21.640
I'm at a different point
in the break-up.

17:21.720 --> 17:24.160
You're over us already?
That's not the case.

17:24.240 --> 17:26.600
Were you over us the first night
when you...

17:26.680 --> 17:30.600
The first night when I left that club
crying, were you over us then?

17:31.960 --> 17:35.440
Were you already over us
before we'd even finished?

17:39.720 --> 17:43.520
Yeah, but I think I wanted to end it
for a long time before that.

17:43.600 --> 17:46.560
It's hard knowing that everything
we've gone through,

17:46.640 --> 17:47.880
it is actually the end.

17:47.960 --> 17:51.240
Last night made everything
a million times more difficult

17:51.320 --> 17:52.960
because I felt that spark.

17:53.040 --> 17:55.480
Knowing that it's the end
is just killing us.

17:55.560 --> 17:57.880
I want to be friends.

17:57.960 --> 18:01.760
The thing is, Kyle, I don't know how
I'll ever be able to be your friend.

18:01.840 --> 18:04.200
I don't know where we go from here.

18:04.280 --> 18:07.680
How the fuck do you handle
living on a boat with your ex?

18:14.600 --> 18:17.080
It's so good to be off the boat

18:17.160 --> 18:20.360
and on this beach without
Holly and Kyle, just having fun.

18:20.440 --> 18:22.520
You don't know what you're gonna get.

18:22.600 --> 18:25.080
Either arguments
or all over each other.

18:25.160 --> 18:26.720
It's just pretty fucked up.

18:26.800 --> 18:28.840
There's no resolution to this.

18:28.920 --> 18:33.400
The only thing that would end this
is if one of them went home.

18:33.480 --> 18:37.520
That is what you do
when you've broken up with someone.

18:37.600 --> 18:39.680
There's nothing else anyone can do.

18:39.760 --> 18:43.040
Holly and Kyle are gonna continue
fighting through Greece,

18:43.120 --> 18:45.120
and it's gonna ruin everyone's time.

18:46.840 --> 18:51.120
Me balls are feeling pure exfoliated
and smooth, like Egyptian cotton.

18:51.200 --> 18:54.240
So, that's beach done
and time to get back to the boat.

18:57.200 --> 19:00.320
We've got some news
that'll cheer everyone up.

19:00.400 --> 19:02.520
We're going to a fucking beach party.

19:02.600 --> 19:04.280
(cheering)

19:04.360 --> 19:07.800
Holly, Kyle and Chloe, get ready
and let's get to that pool party,

19:07.880 --> 19:10.240
but do me a favour,
don't fucking ruin it.

19:15.480 --> 19:19.200
We get to the pool party
and it's fucking going off.

19:23.680 --> 19:27.400
This pool party, it's like nothing
I've experienced before.

19:27.480 --> 19:30.040
This is fucking crazy.

19:44.240 --> 19:48.480
(Scott)I'm on a fucking mission.
There is loads of fit birds.

19:48.560 --> 19:52.160
Me dick doesn't know where to point,
but I might as well follow it.

20:14.760 --> 20:17.280
I don't feel
Charlotte can understand.

20:17.360 --> 20:19.680
Her and Gary
was contained to the house,

20:19.760 --> 20:22.400
but me and Kyle had a relationship
on the outside.

20:33.760 --> 20:35.200
Oh, oh, sorry, Holly.

20:35.280 --> 20:38.560
You are the only person
who's ever liked a boy

20:38.640 --> 20:40.560
and they haven't liked you back.

20:42.880 --> 20:46.840
I've known Holly for years,
and we used to have such a laugh.

20:46.920 --> 20:50.680
But now
I just need a little bit of a break.

20:50.760 --> 20:52.960
I mean, it can get so draining.

20:59.920 --> 21:01.160
Everybody is smashed.

21:01.240 --> 21:03.960
Everyone's forgetting
we've got to go out tonight.

21:04.040 --> 21:06.520
Let's carry on the party,
get back to the boat,

21:06.600 --> 21:08.200
get changed and hit Ios hard.

21:15.400 --> 21:16.880
I can't wait to go out.

21:16.960 --> 21:20.320
I just hope all them girls
from that pool party today are out.

21:20.400 --> 21:21.840
Let's have a good night.

21:21.920 --> 21:25.000
Let's just try
and not to talk about Holly and Kyle.

21:25.080 --> 21:27.600
Me and Holly can deal
with our own problems.

21:27.680 --> 21:29.920
We don't need
everyone else involved.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.920
If they keep their noses out,
everyone'll be happy.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.200
I had a conversation with her today,

21:35.280 --> 21:37.600
saying,
"Listen, I am going to pull."

21:37.680 --> 21:41.160
"And I know it's going to be hard
for you, but I'm still gonna do it."

21:41.240 --> 21:45.800
Kyle, mate. We've all heard the same
fucking story time and time again.

21:45.880 --> 21:48.280
You and Holly are fine.
It's all sorted.

21:48.360 --> 21:50.400
Stop talking utter fucking shit.

21:50.480 --> 21:54.120
She fully understands what I want
and why I broke up with her.

21:54.200 --> 21:56.600
Yeah, she understands
when she's sober.

21:58.000 --> 22:01.960
Well, tonight's gonna be interesting.
Let's try and make it a good one.

22:02.040 --> 22:04.360
I am sick and tired
of being miserable,

22:04.440 --> 22:06.320
so I'm gonna go out with the girls

22:06.400 --> 22:09.120
and I'm gonna have
a fucking wicked time.

22:09.200 --> 22:11.680
We're all ready
and everyone's looking mint.

22:11.760 --> 22:15.280
Let's get fucking mortal!

22:20.360 --> 22:23.320
We get to this place
and it's called The Crazy Viking.

22:23.400 --> 22:26.040
What the fuck?
The Vikings didn't live in Greece.

22:29.240 --> 22:33.520
I'm having such a mint time, me.
Turbo is on top form tonight.

22:44.360 --> 22:46.360
I can't believe what I'm hearing.

22:46.440 --> 22:50.160
Kyle now wants to pull.
What the fuck?

22:56.200 --> 22:58.960
I agree that I shouldn't pull
in front of Holly,

22:59.040 --> 23:02.680
but when I've had a drink
I just don't care about anyone else.

23:02.760 --> 23:05.320
Kyle needs to listen to us
this time.

23:05.400 --> 23:09.000
Because I cannot go through
this shit again.

23:09.080 --> 23:11.400
I'm gonna end up going insane.

23:15.000 --> 23:18.280
I need to talk to Scott about
how I pissed him off last night.

23:18.360 --> 23:20.200
There's no time like the present.

23:24.120 --> 23:27.680
Howay, Chloe. All you wanted
was a bit of Scotty T's chopper.

23:36.680 --> 23:40.360
I cannae believe that she's still
going on about that stupid game.

23:40.440 --> 23:42.800
Here, man, it was only a joke.
Chill out.

23:47.520 --> 23:50.560
Scott's apologised,
but he doesn't give a fuck about me.

23:50.640 --> 23:52.120
All he cares about is fanny.

23:52.200 --> 23:55.120
He'll do the same thing tomorrow.
Or maybe tonight.

24:04.680 --> 24:07.840
I cannae help but flirt with you,
Chloe, so stay away,

24:07.920 --> 24:10.640
cos I'm gonna bang
that Norwegian bird I met today.

24:26.920 --> 24:29.960
I see this lass, and I fancy
a bit of female attention.

24:30.040 --> 24:31.640
What's the harm in talking?

24:36.760 --> 24:39.960
Kyle, you are asking for trouble.
This is a bad idea.

24:43.360 --> 24:46.240
For God's sake.
This couldn't be more obvious.

24:46.320 --> 24:50.040
Two blonde girls have came in.
One for Scott, one for Kyle.

24:50.120 --> 24:52.720
Shit is officially gonna kick off.

24:59.760 --> 25:01.240
Kyle is talking to a girl.

25:01.320 --> 25:04.320
No, no, no, no, no.
I will be putting a stop to this.

25:06.840 --> 25:11.480
Here we go again.

25:27.320 --> 25:29.560
Pushing that girl was out of order.

25:29.640 --> 25:33.240
She doesn't own us any more.
She can't control who I talk to.

25:46.600 --> 25:48.080
Kyle is being a dickhead.

25:48.160 --> 25:50.680
He has no respect
for our relationship at all.

25:58.520 --> 26:01.560
Do you know what it is?
Another night fucking ruined.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.840
I've had a delightful evening,

26:04.920 --> 26:06.880
so now it's time
to take this bird home

26:06.960 --> 26:08.680
and put another hole in the deck.

26:13.080 --> 26:14.880
Today was a fucking wicked day,

26:14.960 --> 26:17.960
but Holly and Kyle, lo and behold,
have ruined it again.

26:18.040 --> 26:19.560
I am done with them two.

26:29.720 --> 26:31.760
Aaron seems to have
a massive problem

26:31.840 --> 26:33.400
with the way me and Holly are.

26:33.480 --> 26:36.160
How is any of it
his fucking business?

26:36.240 --> 26:38.400
Gaz, please get involved here.

26:38.480 --> 26:42.120
You're angry drunk all the time.
This is happening all the time.

26:43.880 --> 26:46.640
Aaron might be pissed,
but he's talking sense.

26:46.720 --> 26:50.480
He's asking Kyle a question
that everybody wants the answer to.

26:52.720 --> 26:55.760
Me and Holly. OK. Talk about
me and Holly all you want.

26:58.240 --> 27:01.760
All the lies and frustration
and bullshit has been building up

27:01.840 --> 27:03.680
and it's fucking coming out now.

27:06.400 --> 27:09.800
Get me out of this taxi cos
I am gonna go fucking ballistic.

27:09.880 --> 27:12.600
If any of these pricks
make me lose my bird tonight,

27:12.680 --> 27:14.760
I am gonna go fucking akka.

27:14.840 --> 27:17.680
Yeah, Kyle. Any fucking time, mate.
Fuck off, mate.

27:17.760 --> 27:19.320
Any time. Come on, then.

27:19.400 --> 27:22.000
Aaron is getting aggressive
and up in me face.

27:22.080 --> 27:24.840
Come on, then.
Fuck off, man! Shut the fuck up!

27:24.920 --> 27:29.360
Kyle just told me to fuck off.
That is like a red rag to a bull.

27:29.440 --> 27:32.920
It's gonna fucking kick off!
Who the fuck you talking to, man?

27:33.000 --> 27:35.320
It was fucking real, man!

27:35.400 --> 27:38.640
Aaron is going in on Kyle
like a raging fucking bull

27:38.720 --> 27:40.960
and I've just become
very protective.

27:41.040 --> 27:43.360
Are you kidding us, Kyle?
Are you kidding?

27:43.440 --> 27:47.000
Aaron's furious and then Gary
started on Kyle. It's going off.

27:47.080 --> 27:48.200
(all shout)

27:48.280 --> 27:51.800
Why is Gary up in my face?
Now I'm fucking fuming.

27:51.880 --> 27:54.080
(all shout)

27:55.320 --> 27:58.320
I've been here from the start
for you. Don't even dare.

27:58.400 --> 27:59.880
(all shout)

28:04.200 --> 28:07.200
I've brought this wicked bird back
to have a good time

28:07.280 --> 28:10.840
and instead we might as well be
watching fucking Mortal Kombat.

28:10.920 --> 28:13.400
(all shout)

28:13.480 --> 28:16.000
I feel like
everyone has just ganged up on us.

28:16.080 --> 28:17.880
I don't deserve this at all.

28:20.800 --> 28:22.960
(all shout)

28:23.040 --> 28:26.800
I'm fucking raging.
I wanna punch him so fucking much.

28:27.720 --> 28:30.800
Stop it!
That is enough!

28:30.880 --> 28:32.840
I feel so sorry for Kyle.

28:32.920 --> 28:36.400
I thought he would always have
the boys, and now he's on his own.

28:36.480 --> 28:40.680
(Charlotte)Gary! Gary! Gary!

28:43.200 --> 28:45.440
Gary, Gary, stop it.

28:53.360 --> 28:55.240
I'm absolutely devastated.

28:55.320 --> 28:59.480
This one relationship
has broke the whole family.

28:59.560 --> 29:01.920
So I get back to the boat
with this bird,

29:02.000 --> 29:05.760
and there's only one thing on my
mind and that's dropping my anchor.

29:05.840 --> 29:08.160
Everyone's back
apart from Holly and Kyle.

29:08.240 --> 29:10.400
If it was up to me,
they could stay there.

29:10.480 --> 29:13.600
Thing is, he's the one
that was talking to that bird.

29:13.680 --> 29:16.560
I sat and spoke to him
and said to him,

29:16.640 --> 29:20.200
"Don't ever do anything in front
of Holly's face. It'll be so bad."

29:20.280 --> 29:24.560
For so long, Kyle has been the one
to divide the girls and the boys,

29:24.640 --> 29:28.120
but now we finally all agree
that Kyle is the problem.

29:28.200 --> 29:30.160
I would never have pictured...

29:31.200 --> 29:35.160
...everyone nearly punching each
other because of what's happening.

29:35.240 --> 29:39.400
Nobody wanted tonight to happen and
tomorrow something's gotta change.

29:39.480 --> 29:41.960
We should go bed
before Holly and Kyle get back.

29:42.040 --> 29:44.440
Yeah, I agree.
(all agree)

29:44.520 --> 29:46.160
Let's go to bed, yous.

29:46.240 --> 29:49.960
(Nathan)But I'm taking the bottle.
We're pirates now!

29:50.040 --> 29:51.320
Kapow!

29:54.600 --> 29:58.880
I know me and Kyle had an argument
tonight, but I feel so sorry for him.

29:58.960 --> 30:01.440
I know I need to talk to him.

30:01.520 --> 30:04.280
Like, I can't believe
that that's just happened.

30:04.360 --> 30:07.080
I can't believe I've ended up
in this situation,

30:07.160 --> 30:10.200
where the lads
have actually fallen out with us.

30:10.280 --> 30:13.520
The lads have been there for us
through this whole break-up.

30:13.600 --> 30:15.520
They're meant to have your back.

30:15.600 --> 30:18.960
I feel really hurt. I don't know
why they just didn't talk to us.

30:19.040 --> 30:21.800
I took a swing at him.
It's all over, innit?

30:21.880 --> 30:24.400
My friendship,
my relationships in the house.

30:24.480 --> 30:28.800
I've lost everyone in this house
except for Holly. I feel so alone.

30:28.880 --> 30:31.440
You've got the girls.
I had the lads.

30:31.520 --> 30:35.200
I don't have anyone now.
You'll always have me.

30:36.240 --> 30:40.720
Mine and Kyle's fights and arguments
are affecting the rest of the house

30:40.800 --> 30:42.760
and that can't keep happening.

30:42.840 --> 30:46.720
I need to know that in the morning,
you're gonna be speaking to us.

31:03.360 --> 31:04.920
(woman moans)

31:11.240 --> 31:15.640
I felt sorry for me bird last night
after everyone kicked off.

31:15.720 --> 31:19.120
We're supposed to be a family.
That just went fucking tits up.

31:23.920 --> 31:26.320
Last night was absolutely horrific.

31:26.400 --> 31:28.680
I've woken up
in a room full of girls that...

31:28.760 --> 31:30.800
I don't know
what they think about me.

31:30.880 --> 31:32.960
All the lads were kicking off.

31:33.040 --> 31:36.400
After last night, today we need
to start making some changes

31:36.480 --> 31:40.400
because we can't all go through this
any longer.

31:40.480 --> 31:42.640
Did anyone see why Gary got involved?

31:42.720 --> 31:46.480
Gary went over
to try and defend Aaron

31:46.560 --> 31:49.000
and then it got heated
between Gary and Kyle.

31:49.080 --> 31:52.080
I feel absolutely heartbroken
for Kyle right now.

31:52.160 --> 31:55.440
I know what it's like to not be liked
by anybody in this house.

31:55.520 --> 31:58.480
It's absolutely awful.
I will always be there for him.

31:58.560 --> 32:00.960
But he needs more
than his ex-girlfriend.

32:01.040 --> 32:06.360
I genuinely, hand on my heart,
believe we won't get back together

32:06.440 --> 32:10.520
and the only thing that we can do now
is to try and live in the same house.

32:10.600 --> 32:12.640
Holly and Kyle cannot live together.

32:12.720 --> 32:15.560
It's draining the house
and it's going nowhere.

32:15.640 --> 32:19.400
We need time to get over each other
and then maybe, it'll be different.

32:24.280 --> 32:28.440
I woke up this morning and last
night, I fought with my brothers.

32:28.520 --> 32:30.080
It's a fucking nightmare.

32:30.960 --> 32:33.880
Hi, dirty boy.
All right, kid?

32:33.960 --> 32:35.600
I've had enough of this shit.

32:35.680 --> 32:38.720
For me, Aaron was in the right.
I was even in the right.

32:38.800 --> 32:40.840
Everybody is thinking the same.

32:41.800 --> 32:43.120
(phone rings)

32:46.840 --> 32:50.200
Anna's obviously heard
about what happened last night.

32:52.400 --> 32:53.560
Right.

32:58.360 --> 32:59.360
I'm sorry, Anna.

32:59.440 --> 33:02.800
That's fine by me, cos that means
no arguments and no fall-outs.

33:04.440 --> 33:05.600
Gary?

33:05.680 --> 33:07.280
Why is Kyle calling my name?

33:07.360 --> 33:10.000
Unless it's an apology,
I am not talking to him.

33:10.080 --> 33:11.880
Anna wants to speak to you.

33:13.280 --> 33:14.400
Hello.

33:16.040 --> 33:17.040
You all right?

33:21.920 --> 33:23.080
Yeah.

33:29.600 --> 33:30.760
Sorry.

33:30.840 --> 33:34.160
I cannot believe
I have been grounded by Anna.

33:34.240 --> 33:35.560
I haven't been grounded

33:35.640 --> 33:38.800
since I egged my neighbour's windows
when I was 14.

33:38.880 --> 33:40.880
What the fuck is that?

33:40.960 --> 33:43.840
Gary and Aaron aren't speaking to us

33:43.920 --> 33:46.480
and I just don't know
where to go from here.

33:52.080 --> 33:55.960
We have tried absolutely everything
to make Holly and Kyle work.

33:56.040 --> 33:57.920
But now we literally give up.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.560
We need a family meeting.

33:59.640 --> 34:01.760
Something has to happen. Now.

34:10.160 --> 34:13.200
Gary's called everyone to top deck
for a family meeting

34:13.280 --> 34:14.600
and it sounds massive.

34:14.680 --> 34:17.480
It sounds dangerous
and I'm a little bit scared.

34:19.720 --> 34:22.840
We've been talking about
this Holly and Kyle thing.

34:22.920 --> 34:25.920
I think everyone agrees
that something's gotta happen.

34:26.000 --> 34:29.720
I'm fucking sick of it now, me.
I'm literally fucking sick of it.

34:29.800 --> 34:32.400
Everything got totally out of hand
last night.

34:32.480 --> 34:35.160
I hated seeing the lads
kick off with each other.

34:35.240 --> 34:38.680
It was fine when the arguments
just stayed between them two,

34:38.760 --> 34:42.320
but last night, for example,
everyone was involved.

34:42.400 --> 34:44.840
Finally, everyone's saying
how they feel

34:44.920 --> 34:46.960
about the Holly and Kyle situation.

34:47.040 --> 34:49.280
Now we've gotta do something
about it.

34:49.360 --> 34:53.120
We need to get them both up here
and to their faces just say,

34:53.200 --> 34:57.240
"Look, as a group we honestly think
that one of yous need to go."

34:59.280 --> 35:02.480
(Aaron)Fucking hell.
This has gone far enough.

35:02.560 --> 35:04.680
They've tried, and so have we,
to fix it.

35:04.760 --> 35:06.960
There doesn't seem to be
any resolution.

35:08.800 --> 35:10.760
I feel sick.

35:10.840 --> 35:14.280
We're all sat on the top deck
planning how we're gonna do this.

35:14.360 --> 35:17.440
It feels like
we're organising a funeral.

35:17.520 --> 35:20.480
Right, I'm gonna get Holly.
I'd better get Kyle.

35:23.120 --> 35:25.160
Fuck. Here we go.

35:28.560 --> 35:30.440
Charlotte wants a word.

35:30.520 --> 35:33.000
I walk upstairs
and everybody's sat there.

35:33.080 --> 35:34.800
What the fuck's going on?

35:34.880 --> 35:36.120
Well, this is weird.

35:37.240 --> 35:39.320
I walk out and no-one's speaking.

35:39.400 --> 35:42.240
Everyone's silent. Dead silent.

35:44.640 --> 35:47.080
(Charlotte)I feel so uncomfortable.

35:48.520 --> 35:50.400
(Marnie)This is horrible.

35:50.480 --> 35:53.360
You could literally cut
the atmosphere with a knife.

35:57.440 --> 36:00.600
Right. Obviously...
we've got yous both up here.

36:00.680 --> 36:03.800
Erm... First of all,
last night shouldn't have happened.

36:03.880 --> 36:07.400
And somehow we need to sort out

36:07.480 --> 36:10.280
how we're gonna stop
all this arguing and...

36:10.360 --> 36:13.920
We've been speaking all day as...

36:14.000 --> 36:15.880
Oh, come on, Gary, man. Just say it.

36:15.960 --> 36:17.760
One of yous is gonna have to go.

36:25.560 --> 36:27.720
I'm absolutely devastated.

36:27.800 --> 36:30.960
Everyone's realised that
there's no other resolution.

36:31.040 --> 36:33.560
We can't live in the same house
any more.

36:33.640 --> 36:37.640
At the minute, it's gotten
to the point where it's too far,

36:37.720 --> 36:40.520
where it's not just
between you and Kyle any more,

36:40.600 --> 36:42.960
it's kind of between everyone.

36:43.040 --> 36:46.120
Watching people who you live with
every day sit there

36:46.200 --> 36:49.680
and, like, say one of us
needs to go away, that's shit, man.

36:49.760 --> 36:51.520
That's totally shit.

36:51.600 --> 36:54.880
I apologise for, like, last night.
That's not me and you...

36:54.960 --> 36:57.880
No, I apologise.
I shouldn't have shoved ya.

36:57.960 --> 37:01.440
I don't want to see Holly crying
every day.

37:01.520 --> 37:02.840
It's kind of difficult

37:02.920 --> 37:06.960
because, like, yesterday was, like,
the first time me and Kyle sat down,

37:07.040 --> 37:09.520
we actually talked
the truth to each other.

37:09.600 --> 37:13.280
The whole conversations between me
and Holly up until yesterday

37:13.360 --> 37:16.360
have been...
I would say, sugar coated.

37:16.440 --> 37:17.600
Yeah.

37:17.680 --> 37:19.960
So, like,
I've been ending it with her,

37:20.040 --> 37:23.600
but sugar coating it, because
I didn't wanna see her so upset.

37:23.680 --> 37:28.200
What Kyle doesn't understand is
that his sugar-coating is him lying

37:28.280 --> 37:30.520
and that's what's got him
into this mess.

37:30.600 --> 37:33.160
We can't see a conclusion to this
at all.

37:33.240 --> 37:36.440
I can't either. We can't understand
what's gonna happen.

37:36.520 --> 37:38.680
It's too late.
One of yous has gotta go.

37:38.760 --> 37:41.360
To get over it,
one of yous does have to go.

37:46.400 --> 37:49.080
It's horrible.
It's fucking horrible.

37:49.160 --> 37:51.600
I'll make it easier for yous.
I'll go.

37:52.960 --> 37:57.960
I looked at Kyle's face
and I seen how upset he was.

37:58.040 --> 38:02.360
And I seen in his eyes
that he knew that he'd done wrong.

38:02.440 --> 38:06.040
And that he should have just been
honest from the beginning.

38:06.120 --> 38:09.360
He hasn't just lost me now.
He's lost everyone.

38:10.200 --> 38:11.800
You'll get over it. I'll go.

38:11.880 --> 38:14.080
Like, why...
Why should you get to go?

38:14.160 --> 38:16.800
Why should you get to go home
and see your family?

38:16.880 --> 38:20.960
Kyle's saying that he wants to go,
but Holly's saying that she will.

38:21.040 --> 38:24.240
This is probably gonna
turn into another argument.

38:24.320 --> 38:26.360
But now it's time for someone to go.

38:33.560 --> 38:35.760
(cries)

38:36.640 --> 38:38.480
Hol, it's the right thing to do.

38:39.640 --> 38:40.920
I'll go and see him.

38:41.000 --> 38:42.040
(cries)

38:43.400 --> 38:47.280
This is so hard to watch and I can't
actually believe it's happening.

38:47.360 --> 38:48.840
Kyle's going home.

38:52.600 --> 38:56.080
I thought I was in a house
with a family where, like,

38:56.160 --> 38:59.400
we'll work through anything
and we're part of anything,

38:59.480 --> 39:01.000
and no matter what happens

39:01.080 --> 39:05.320
we'll always come to some kind of,
like, agreement and resolve.

39:05.400 --> 39:09.000
And the fact is that they couldn't
come to a resolve for me and Holly.

39:09.080 --> 39:11.760
Just feels like me family's
turned its back on us.

39:19.160 --> 39:21.400
This is fucking shit, this.

39:21.480 --> 39:25.280
A relationship has never came
between the house like this one has.

39:25.360 --> 39:27.480
And I'm losing a fucking mate
over it.

39:28.440 --> 39:29.720
Fucking hell.

39:31.120 --> 39:32.760
Oh, my God.

39:34.440 --> 39:37.000
I feel like it's my fault.
It's not your fault.

39:37.080 --> 39:39.240
It's his own fault.
(cries)

39:40.880 --> 39:42.960
I can't do this.

39:44.160 --> 39:45.400
Oh, my God.

39:45.480 --> 39:48.880
The way Holly's going on, you'd
think Kyle's walking the plank.

39:48.960 --> 39:52.280
He's only going back to Newcastle.
Fucking hell. Calm down.

39:57.200 --> 39:59.520
(cries)

40:02.560 --> 40:03.800
I'm sorry about this.

40:06.760 --> 40:08.480
Just go home and clear your head.

40:33.360 --> 40:35.400
(cries)

40:48.960 --> 40:51.360
I feel like now this is the end.

40:51.440 --> 40:54.400
I'm completely broken
because a part of me

40:54.480 --> 40:58.240
still just wanted him to turn round
and say that he'd made a mistake.

40:58.320 --> 41:02.400
And that he didn't want this.
That he was stupid.

41:02.480 --> 41:05.160
But he didn't want to be with us.

41:05.240 --> 41:08.800
But a part of me
still wants to be with him.

41:11.600 --> 41:14.120
The house thinks
I didn't want to be with Holly.

41:14.200 --> 41:15.800
I did wanna be with her one day.

41:15.880 --> 41:20.920
But the fact is, for the time being
I just wanted to be single.

41:22.320 --> 41:24.920
And sometimes I think
I totally regret that.

41:27.920 --> 41:29.840
(cries)

41:31.240 --> 41:34.240
Fair play to Kyle
for volunteering to leave,

41:34.320 --> 41:37.280
but let's be honest,
he jumped before he was pushed.

41:48.760 --> 41:48.960
.
