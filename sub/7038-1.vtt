00:36.465 --> 00:40.533
Once in a great while, mankind unlocks a secret so profound...

00:40.666 --> 00:45.033
that our future
is altered forever.

00:45.133 --> 00:48.267
Fire. Electricity.

00:48.367 --> 00:51.234
Splitting the atom.

00:51.734 --> 00:56.900
At the dawn of the 31st century,
we unlocked another.

00:57.300 --> 01:01.934
It had the potential to change
humanity's role in the universe.

01:02.034 --> 01:05.168
We called it the Titan project,
and it was a testament...

01:05.301 --> 01:08.368
to the limitless power
of the human imagination.

01:08.502 --> 01:11.467
Perhaps that is what
the Drej feared most,

01:11.567 --> 01:16.668
for... it brought them down
upon us without warning...

01:16.768 --> 01:19.601
and... without mercy.

01:19.701 --> 01:24.469
Cale, that day, the day
the Drej descended from the sky,

01:24.569 --> 01:28.470
the only thing that mattered
was keeping you safe.

01:37.535 --> 01:39.334
Perfect !

01:54.135 --> 01:56.469
Hey, stop !
Come on !

01:59.202 --> 02:01.303
- Cale, are you all right ?

02:01.402 --> 02:04.304
I'm okay.

02:05.204 --> 02:08.102
Dad,
my invention broke.

02:08.202 --> 02:13.036
Well, then, we'll fix it together,
but not today, Cale. We have to go now.

02:29.269 --> 02:31.802
Dad, where's
everybody going ?

02:31.902 --> 02:36.470
We're leaving too.
We all have to go somewhere safe.

02:36.570 --> 02:42.337
Professor Tucker ! Professor Tucker !
The Drej have reached the global defense system !

02:43.137 --> 02:46.370
Come on, son.
Will we get the people away in time ?

02:46.502 --> 02:49.803
- Not if we sit here talking, sir.
- I wanna drive.

02:49.903 --> 02:52.370
- When you're older, kid.
- I'm older than four.

02:53.171 --> 02:55.538
- Hang on !

03:01.105 --> 03:02.205
Whoa !

03:02.705 --> 03:06.237
- Please proceed to your designated-
- Is the Titan prepped for launch ?

03:06.337 --> 03:09.937
- Just waiting for you, sir !
- Intelligence says the Drej
don't know the Titan's location,

03:10.038 --> 03:11.771
or we would've
been hit already.

03:11.871 --> 03:14.438
Let's pray
they're right !

03:18.072 --> 03:21.339
Enemy warships
have entered our solar system.

03:22.439 --> 03:23.803
Are we going in that ?

03:25.104 --> 03:27.403
- Wow !
- Cale,

03:27.804 --> 03:30.671
I have to go
on a different ship.

03:30.771 --> 03:33.572
- I have to go away for a while.

03:33.671 --> 03:36.038
No, Dad ! No !

03:36.138 --> 03:40.239
- Tek is going to look after you.
- But I wanna go with you !

03:40.339 --> 03:43.471
- Sir-
- I know.
It's not safe where I'm going.

03:43.571 --> 03:46.805
- Sir ! Professor !
- All right, I'm coming !

03:46.905 --> 03:52.739
Cale, here. Take this.
As long as you wear it, there's hope.

03:53.139 --> 03:58.640
- I will see you again. I promise.
- Okay.

03:59.473 --> 04:03.339
- No, it's not okay ! It's not okay !

04:03.439 --> 04:06.406
- Tek, keep him safe !
- Daddy !

04:06.506 --> 04:08.940
- Korso, go !
- Come back !

04:13.707 --> 04:18.341
- Evacuate ! Evacuate !
- Godspeed, Sam Tucker !

04:18.440 --> 04:20.838
Attention, pilots. Drej Stingers are-

04:20.938 --> 04:24.072
This is Tucker.
Bring me down.

04:24.172 --> 04:26.272
Attention, pilots.

04:26.406 --> 04:30.540
Drej Stingers are attacking
the escape vehicles.

04:34.640 --> 04:37.208
Okay. Are we all here ?
Bobby, buckle up.

04:44.940 --> 04:47.974
- Now, Sam. Now !
- Go, Dad ! Go !

04:48.073 --> 04:50.808
- Get out of there. Get out of there !
- Come on.

07:02.612 --> 07:04.812
<i> Lose my head to the chemical freeway </i>

07:04.912 --> 07:10.143
<i> Comin' up on overload
Losing sure is easy, so I am no more </i>

07:10.243 --> 07:13.644
<i> But I'm not broken </i>

07:13.744 --> 07:17.277
<i> In my dream, I win </i>

07:17.411 --> 07:21.211
<i> Out here, I'm nothing </i>

07:21.311 --> 07:24.845
<i> A cosmic castaway </i>

07:24.945 --> 07:29.378
<i> In my head I'm a chemical dreamer
Speed up to the burn out mode </i>

07:29.478 --> 07:32.811
-  Comin' up to fifth dimension
Beautify, don't crucify me 

07:32.911 --> 07:36.712
-  So I need no mindgame
poisoning my lonely soul 
- Eat this.

07:36.812 --> 07:39.712
-  Losing sure is easy
so I am no more 

07:40.013 --> 07:43.713
-  But I'm not broken 

07:43.846 --> 07:46.978
<i> In my dream, I win </i>

07:47.112 --> 07:50.845
- It's lunch. One hour for lunch.
-  And I take over 

07:50.979 --> 07:54.745
<i> 'Cause I'm no loser </i>

07:54.845 --> 07:59.079
-  And I'm in and you're not 
- Whoo ! Whoo-hoo !

07:59.180 --> 08:02.447
<i> Bad dreams don't stop </i>

08:02.547 --> 08:06.078
<i> But I'm all screwed up </i>

08:06.178 --> 08:09.845
<i> A cosmic castaway, yeah </i>

08:09.945 --> 08:13.612
<i> A cosmic castaway, yeah </i>

08:13.712 --> 08:16.580
<i> A cosmic castaway </i>

08:29.313 --> 08:30.780
- How ya hittin' 'em, Chowquin ?

08:30.880 --> 08:33.947
- Hey- Chow- Chowquin.
- Wait.

08:34.047 --> 08:36.880
Hey, it's me. It's Cale, all right ?
I'm not with those losers.

08:36.980 --> 08:39.780
Humans wait.

08:39.881 --> 08:42.048
- Uppity Earth scum.

08:45.046 --> 08:49.580
- Guess you're stuck with us losers.
- Don't count on it.

08:49.680 --> 08:53.447
- You wait in line, pal.
I'm takin' the express.
-  Cosmic castaway 

08:53.547 --> 08:56.048
-  Yeah 
- Go through the docks,
you'll get yourself killed.

08:56.482 --> 09:00.249
Coward. You know, the odds of a ship
docking are a thousand to one.

09:00.349 --> 09:03.180
-  Yeah, a cosmic castaway 

09:03.349 --> 09:04.480
- And that would be the one.

09:22.014 --> 09:24.080
Wow.

09:25.781 --> 09:26.981
- Hi.

09:29.715 --> 09:32.448
Mm-hmm.

09:34.782 --> 09:37.250
Hey, wh- Hey !

09:39.283 --> 09:41.181
Wow.

09:42.081 --> 09:43.881
- We're locked down, Captain.

09:43.981 --> 09:48.449
All right. Keep her hot.
I'll be in touch.

09:49.049 --> 09:51.816
- How you doin' today ? Workin'
hard, are you ? Bon appetit.

09:51.917 --> 09:55.350
Next ! Keep the line moving.
Here you go.

09:55.450 --> 09:59.181
- Akrennian Beetle Sushimi.
- You got ketchup ?

09:59.315 --> 10:03.048
Ketchup ? Ketchup ? You don't need
ketchup. Please, next. Move along.

10:03.148 --> 10:06.482
He's a disgrace.
Those dirty humans.

10:06.582 --> 10:09.149
Ketchup ! Boy, some nerve,
human. Nice head, human.

10:09.249 --> 10:14.149
I'm not askin' that much.
I'd just like them to kill my food
before they serve it to me.

10:15.750 --> 10:18.715
- You know, I do an honest day's work.
I want already dead food.

10:18.815 --> 10:21.316
- Mm.
- Is that too much for a fellow to ask ?

10:21.416 --> 10:25.417
- Do you hear a crackling sound ?
- And what was up with Chowquin ?

10:26.017 --> 10:29.484
- You should've seen him.
- Ha-ha, not much chance of that.

10:29.584 --> 10:33.818
- He was so out of control,
treatin' me like I'm some kind of-
- Human ?

10:34.451 --> 10:36.251
Don't start with
that solidarity thing again.

10:36.351 --> 10:41.516
- If you would study
human history as you've been instructed,

10:41.616 --> 10:46.251
you might realize you're not
alone out there, and you'd be
better prepared for the future.

10:46.351 --> 10:50.552
- Well, I'll tell you somethin'
about your famous future.
- Mmm.

10:50.652 --> 10:55.252
Every day I wake up, it's still the
present, the same grimy, boring present.

10:55.351 --> 10:57.583
I don't think
this future thing exists.

10:58.183 --> 11:01.917
- Do you hear a crackling sound ?

11:04.017 --> 11:04.851
- Here we go.

11:07.218 --> 11:10.251
- We gotta get outta this dump.
- Hold on, everybody ! I got it !

11:10.385 --> 11:15.717
Please don't panic.
Just think of it as floating time.
Two seconds. Everybody calm.

11:18.817 --> 11:21.551
Ah. Just needed some love.

11:25.052 --> 11:26.952
Let's get back to eatin' baby.

11:30.620 --> 11:33.119
Okay. Well, I'm full.

11:35.752 --> 11:38.051
Ohh.

11:52.917 --> 11:55.652
- Hey, Cale.

11:56.152 --> 12:00.652
- Firrikash. Po, how's it floatin' ?

12:01.352 --> 12:06.419
- You pulled a nasty stunt back there.
- We don't like your attitude.

12:07.519 --> 12:10.254
- You've been a little uppity.

12:10.354 --> 12:14.319
Up-Up- Is that so ? Well.
I'm gonna have to work on that.

12:29.688 --> 12:34.353
- You wanna hunt humans, just remember:
We travel in packs.

12:34.454 --> 12:38.120
- What are you doing ?
- It's commonly known as helping.

12:38.220 --> 12:40.521
Yeah ? Well, what for ?

12:40.621 --> 12:43.188
Sometimes, kid, people
just help each other out.

12:43.788 --> 12:46.755
- Oh, right.

12:46.855 --> 12:50.320
So you're gonna tell me
you don't want something in return ?

12:50.419 --> 12:55.354
- All right. Maybe I do.
- What a shock.

12:55.487 --> 12:59.887
I want you to risk your life.
I want you to give up everything
you have to join the mission,

12:59.987 --> 13:04.221
where you'll face terror and torture
and possibly gruesome death.

13:04.321 --> 13:07.355
And I would
wanna do that because... ?

13:07.455 --> 13:12.387
Because... it's worth it.
Because... the human race needs you.

13:12.487 --> 13:16.888
Maybe you haven't
had a look around lately, but
there aren't many of us left.

13:16.988 --> 13:20.155
At the rate we're going, they'll be
reading about us in textbooks...

13:20.255 --> 13:24.456
- and displaying our bones
in alien museums.

13:25.556 --> 13:29.655
- Yeah, well, having your planet
blown up can have that effect on a species.

13:29.788 --> 13:35.022
But maybe I've been wrong all
these years, and it took your
inspiring speech to make me see it.

13:35.122 --> 13:38.756
You've really changed me.
It's beautiful.

13:38.856 --> 13:40.789
I think we've gotta hug.

13:40.889 --> 13:45.688
- Oh, man.
They've really ground you down.
- Hey, get this straight.

13:45.788 --> 13:48.588
I don't even know you.
I don't want any part of your mission,

13:48.688 --> 13:53.189
- and I don't need your help
with these oversized morons.

13:53.488 --> 13:55.489
Oh, okay.

13:59.723 --> 14:03.123
- I think he called you morons.

14:03.223 --> 14:06.255
- Whoa !
- Korso.

14:06.355 --> 14:10.456
Captain, this is Akima.
We are not alone.

14:10.556 --> 14:13.289
Are we in good company ?

14:14.189 --> 14:15.790
That's a negative,
Captain.

14:15.890 --> 14:19.957
I think we've fallen in
with a very bad crowd.

14:21.757 --> 14:25.123
Roger that.
Let's prep for departure.

14:28.156 --> 14:31.624
Tek, I need to be scarce
for a while.

14:32.124 --> 14:33.757
- You don't know the half of it.
- Ha-ha.

14:33.858 --> 14:37.091
Are you still bothering people ?
Hey, go away.

14:38.558 --> 14:42.689
Great job with the kid, Tek.
He's a charmer.

14:42.789 --> 14:45.923
I expected you to take him
off my hands a lot sooner.

14:46.023 --> 14:49.490
- Tek, hey, wait.
Who is this ? You know him ?
- Joseph Korso.

14:49.524 --> 14:53.691
- I was with your father
on the Titan project.
- My father.

14:53.791 --> 14:57.658
- I don't have a father.
You brought this guy here ?

14:58.258 --> 15:01.090
- Yes.
- I don't understand. Why ?

15:01.223 --> 15:03.723
You still got that ring
your father gave you ?

15:03.857 --> 15:05.890
- Give it to me.
- Hey, give it back !

15:06.024 --> 15:08.057
- Cale-
- Shh.

15:10.058 --> 15:13.458
- Ahh.

15:13.558 --> 15:16.125
Ah. Here.

15:17.225 --> 15:19.791
- Put it on.
- Hmm.

15:25.292 --> 15:27.691
- How did- How did you-
- It's a storage device.

15:27.792 --> 15:31.693
It's genetically encrypted to your
father, and therefore, to you.

15:31.792 --> 15:33.860
It's a map, Cale.

15:33.959 --> 15:37.827
It can tell us
where your father hid the Titan.

15:37.927 --> 15:41.191
That's why I've spent
the last 15 years lookin' for ya.

15:42.925 --> 15:47.892
That ship means everything.
Humanity depends on you finding it.

15:47.992 --> 15:50.493
Me ?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:50.593 --> 15:54.093
Me ? No, no, no.
I'm not- Tek, listen,

15:55.193 --> 15:56.827
there must
be someone better.

15:57.627 --> 16:00.392
It's time, Cale.
It's time to stop running.

16:02.092 --> 16:03.726
- Well, actually,

16:03.859 --> 16:06.559
I think it's time
to start.

16:09.527 --> 16:12.260
Drej.
What do they want ?

16:12.394 --> 16:16.726
They want you, kid.
Same way I want you, only dead.

16:16.826 --> 16:20.026
How do you know
they want me dead ?

16:31.294 --> 16:33.861
I'm convinced.

16:34.461 --> 16:37.093
We gotta get
to the kitchen.

16:39.793 --> 16:41.093
- Korso, the gravity drive !

16:47.327 --> 16:49.794
- You ready ?
- Tek, I'll lead you in.

16:49.928 --> 16:53.795
- I'll stay here.
- Tek, you can't.

16:53.895 --> 16:56.393
Take care of the kid.
He's not all grown up yet.

16:56.494 --> 17:00.461
- No, no, no, no. You're coming.
- Go, Cale. I'll read about you.

17:01.161 --> 17:03.227
Follow me !

17:05.061 --> 17:07.895
Whoa !

17:08.595 --> 17:12.796
- Well, this would be good
if we had any baking to do.

17:12.929 --> 17:16.060
Oh, my food !
You guys are- You're terrible.

17:16.194 --> 17:19.794
You're unsanitary.
Ooh, I hope that they catch you,

17:19.928 --> 17:22.662
and I'll testify against you,
and you'll never get out of jail.

17:22.762 --> 17:27.429
- Hey, you'll get
all the ketchup you want.

17:27.529 --> 17:30.663
- Drej ! Ooh, I gotta go now.
- Follow ugly !

17:30.763 --> 17:34.094
Oh, great. Yeah, no one would ever
think of looking for us in the vent.

17:34.194 --> 17:36.094
Go !

17:38.528 --> 17:40.763
- Go ! Go !

17:43.863 --> 17:49.097
He's the big- I'm not supposed to be here !
Come on ! I'm just a cook !

17:49.229 --> 17:53.162
How do I get out of here ? How do I get
out ? Why is this happening to me ?

17:53.295 --> 17:57.363
Stupid- Please- Stupid- No !

17:57.496 --> 18:00.396
Hi. They went right down there.
They came into my kitchen and-

18:00.496 --> 18:03.697
Bull's-eye.

18:09.897 --> 18:13.362
We gotta
get outta here.

18:13.462 --> 18:15.362
Go !

18:16.463 --> 18:18.797
Go ! Run !

18:33.663 --> 18:35.563
- Over.
- Huh ?

18:35.663 --> 18:38.496
- Maybe next time, kid.
- Hey, I can fly it too.

18:41.596 --> 18:42.331
- It won't start.

18:42.431 --> 18:45.031
I got an idea.

18:48.163 --> 18:51.397
Give it a shot.
Whoa !

18:59.365 --> 19:02.032
Ow !

19:02.132 --> 19:05.032
- Hang on, kid. I'm comin'.

19:18.532 --> 19:21.599
Heads up !

19:21.899 --> 19:24.766
They're
locking down the doors !

19:24.866 --> 19:27.598
- Not going forward. Going up.
- Up ?

19:31.732 --> 19:34.131
Move it !

19:49.566 --> 19:52.833
- You should brace yourself.
- Uh, yeah. I'm feeling that.

20:00.367 --> 20:03.565
Eject. Hey, where's the eject ?
Cale ? Cale ?

20:03.699 --> 20:07.500
This model does
have eject, right ?

20:16.667 --> 20:17.935
And you were worried.

20:19.234 --> 20:20.434
What do you mean, "were" ?

20:20.534 --> 20:25.599
- Akima, we need a pickup here.
- A little late for that.

20:25.699 --> 20:29.500
- I'm right
above you. Can you get to me ?
- Not enough time.

20:29.599 --> 20:33.467
Not-Not-
Not a lot of time.

20:34.167 --> 20:35.867
- Exhale.
- You gotta be kidding.

20:36.101 --> 20:39.368
- Exhale.
- Oh, no, no, no, no !

21:19.100 --> 21:21.734
<i> Comeback down to Earth, oh, yeah </i>

21:21.834 --> 21:26.402
<i> Comeback down to Earth
Comeback down to Earth </i>

21:26.502 --> 21:30.069
<i> Oh, yeah
Comeback down to Earth </i>

21:30.769 --> 21:33.102
- Is it dead ? Can we eat it ?

21:33.203 --> 21:36.303
No, it's not dead.

21:36.903 --> 21:39.735
Who are you ?
Go away.

21:39.568 --> 21:43.502
- Hey, what's going on ?
- Preed, you're in my light.

21:43.635 --> 21:46.936
Ah, such motherly concern
for the subject.

21:47.036 --> 21:52.103
- Why am I naked ?
- Why, you positively glow
with maternal warmth, Akima.

21:52.204 --> 21:54.870
It's very fetching.
I must have you.

21:55.370 --> 21:58.802
- In your dreams.
- Akrennians don't dream, remember ?

21:58.902 --> 22:01.536
- They don't bathe much, either.
- I'm still naked here.

22:02.036 --> 22:06.103
I hadn't noticed. Now, hold still, or
you'll lose something really important.

22:06.203 --> 22:10.771
- Hand me the probe.
- The probe ? Uh,
wh-where does the probe go ?

22:10.871 --> 22:15.335
You know, I'm really feeling
much better. Aah ! Hey !

22:15.468 --> 22:17.869
This is just great.
Cross half the galaxy,

22:18.002 --> 22:20.902
nearly get our butts
shot off by the Drej,

22:21.002 --> 22:23.637
just so we can
rescue the window washer.

22:23.737 --> 22:27.470
Hey, for your information, I happen
to be humanity's last great hope.

22:27.570 --> 22:30.904
- I weep for the species.
- You're fine.

22:31.004 --> 22:34.803
I mean, I'm the guy with the map here.
This is big medicine, right ?

22:34.903 --> 22:38.569
Big medicine ? Let me see.

22:38.670 --> 22:42.070
This is really it ?
This can save us ?

22:43.170 --> 22:45.971
Huh ? Yeah, I guess.

22:48.772 --> 22:52.472
- Do you know what this means ?

22:52.605 --> 22:56.004
Um, I'm really wanting those pants
right about now.

22:56.104 --> 22:58.804
Akima, my pet, if the boy isn't
at death's door,

22:58.904 --> 23:01.905
Korso wants Gune to check the map
so we can set a course.

23:02.005 --> 23:04.606
Do you mind ?
Are we through pawing ?

23:04.706 --> 23:08.606
- This is the Valkyrie,
not a singles bar.
- We're done.

23:08.706 --> 23:13.170
You know,
I never said I was gonna help you guys.
We never even addressed what's in it for me.

23:14.304 --> 23:17.370
- Why, you get to be a hero.
- A hero ? Come on.

23:17.470 --> 23:21.438
I mean, there must be something on the
Titan worth selling or trading or-

23:21.538 --> 23:26.072
What ? We're gonna risk our necks
to help a bunch of Drifter Colony bums ?

23:26.205 --> 23:30.671
- Where are my pants ?

23:30.771 --> 23:34.471
- Guess where Akima grew up.
- Drifter Colony ?

23:34.571 --> 23:40.206
- Yes. The boy learns.
- Wait. What's your-

23:40.306 --> 23:45.473
Preed, wait up ! Look.
Where's Korso ? I wanna talk to him.

23:45.574 --> 23:49.772
I believe he's in Navigation.
We're headed there now.

23:53.772 --> 23:56.073
- You wanna watch
who you're steppin' on.

23:56.172 --> 23:58.473
Or you'll what ?

23:58.606 --> 24:03.241
- Ah, the lovely and talented Stith.
This is Cale.

24:03.341 --> 24:06.308
- You remember- Cale.
- No, no, no, no, no. Cannot talk.

24:06.408 --> 24:09.871
We lost targeting on one
of our aft gun turrets again !

24:09.971 --> 24:12.339
What ? Think
this is a pleasure cruise ?

24:12.439 --> 24:17.573
She's a sweet little thing.
Weapons specialist.
Normally, she's very good-natured.

24:17.673 --> 24:22.141
Great !
Things aren't bad enough !

24:22.241 --> 24:25.741
- Tools all over the floor !
- Fight the good fight, precious.

24:25.874 --> 24:29.839
Preed, I'll kill you. Okay ?
I will kill you.

24:29.973 --> 24:33.807
I am educated and well-read !
I am not a mechanic !

24:33.906 --> 24:38.374
- I have my pride ! - Gune ? Guney ? Are you in there ?

24:38.507 --> 24:41.808
...by the acceleration, multiplied
by the coefficient of the friction...

24:41.908 --> 24:43.875
and apply necessary force.

24:44.675 --> 24:46.940
- Gune ?
- Ooh.

24:47.040 --> 24:50.107
- Look at that.
- Does this look familiar ?
Do you know what it is ?

24:50.207 --> 24:56.675
- Neither do I. I made it
last night in my sleep. Apparently, I used Gindrogac-
highly unstable.

24:57.208 --> 25:00.409
- Gune.
- I put a button on it, yes.

25:00.542 --> 25:04.708
I wish to press it, but I'm not sure
what will happen if I do.

25:05.140 --> 25:09.740
- Let me see, now. Three, five,
twenty-two, seventy-four,

25:09.840 --> 25:11.740
- eleven-

25:11.841 --> 25:14.308
- No. No-no-no-no. Careful.

25:14.408 --> 25:19.409
- It's perfect.
- Ho, yes !

25:19.509 --> 25:22.242
- Hey.
- Perfect ! You fixed it !

25:22.342 --> 25:25.374
- So, where are we now ?

25:25.474 --> 25:29.474
We are here, right here-
Bellasan Quadrant.

25:29.974 --> 25:35.409
About three million keks from Tau 14.
Why ? Are you homesick ?

25:36.243 --> 25:39.176
- Gotta have a home for that.
- Mmm.

25:39.276 --> 25:42.875
Translucent bipedal
mesomorphic embryonic male.

25:42.975 --> 25:46.909
Yes, yes, yes. This is all very
fascinating, but take a look at this.

25:47.009 --> 25:50.509
- It's a map. Can you read it ?
- Can I read it ?

25:50.609 --> 25:53.444
Of course I can read it.
Yes. Hmm.

25:53.543 --> 25:56.010
- So, what do you see ?
- Ah !

25:56.110 --> 25:59.877
- Yes, this is Pl'ochda.

25:59.977 --> 26:04.275
- And this- this-
this is... Solbrecht !

26:04.375 --> 26:07.275
And this- And this-
And this- What is this ?

26:07.375 --> 26:10.943
- That's, uh- That's lunch.
- What's lunch ?

26:11.076 --> 26:13.776
- Mmm.

26:13.876 --> 26:18.944
Spaghetti derivative, meatballs- sort
of, anyway- and Caldoch droppings.

26:19.044 --> 26:23.276
- Who ate it before you did ?
- Hey, hey !

26:23.376 --> 26:25.610
Ahh !

26:25.710 --> 26:29.210
- Tell you a secret. This guy's nuts.
- I'll tell you another.

26:29.310 --> 26:32.477
He's never wrong.
Where are we going, Gune ?

26:32.577 --> 26:37.378
Ahh, the broken moon
of Sesharrim.

26:37.479 --> 26:39.410
Only 13,000 keks away.

26:39.510 --> 26:42.043
- Have Akima lay in a course.
- We're on our way.

26:54.512 --> 26:58.576
- What's on Sesharrim, anyway ?
- The Gauol, an ancient race.

26:58.676 --> 27:01.310
- Great.
- This isn't a joyride, kid.

27:01.410 --> 27:05.578
When the Drej destroyed Earth,
they figured life adrift in space...

27:05.678 --> 27:09.244
would break us down,
wipe us out.

27:09.844 --> 27:13.979
Do you really want
those vile creatures to be right ?

27:16.046 --> 27:20.478
- Just lay down and die ?
- A little late.

27:20.611 --> 27:25.679
About 15 years too late
to save the humans. But it's not
like we didn't have a good run.

27:25.779 --> 27:29.479
It's not about a good run.
It's about our survival.

27:29.579 --> 27:34.113
See, the Titan was truly visionary,
the most advanced ship in the universe.

27:34.213 --> 27:39.511
That ship has the power to reunite
the human race, to give us a home.

27:40.412 --> 27:43.279
And the only way to find it
is in your hand.

27:43.379 --> 27:46.879
So, you're really
counting on me, then ?

27:46.979 --> 27:50.280
- We all are.
- Well,

27:50.380 --> 27:53.347
if I don't like
the way things are going,

27:53.481 --> 27:57.079
I'll show you how much
like my father I really am.

27:59.911 --> 28:01.745
I'll leave.

28:17.279 --> 28:19.913
Ahh, no place to
set down on the island.

28:20.013 --> 28:23.281
Land on that coral reef.

28:31.148 --> 28:34.447
We'll take the sled,
see if we can locate the Gauol.

28:34.547 --> 28:38.180
- Preed, you and Gune watch the ship.
- Watch the ship ?

28:38.280 --> 28:41.614
- And keep the engines hot.
- Oh, yes. They'll be nice and toasty.

28:41.714 --> 28:45.715
- Hmm.
- I'm not keen on the Drej catching me
with my trousers down.

28:47.348 --> 28:50.082
Welcome to Planet Sesharrim, Cale.

28:50.182 --> 28:53.079
- It stinks.
- Hydrogen trees.

28:53.180 --> 28:56.814
Clip one of those,
and we'll be blown to steaming bits.

28:57.948 --> 29:01.681
Hello ? Anybody here ?

29:01.781 --> 29:04.048
We're looking
for the Gauol.

29:04.148 --> 29:07.182
Now, what exactly
do the Gauol look like ?

29:07.282 --> 29:10.180
Don't know.
They don't get out much.

29:11.280 --> 29:14.881
We have a kid with a map here
that you guys should know about.

29:34.682 --> 29:38.116
I think we know
what happened to the Gauol.

29:39.283 --> 29:42.050
Open fire on five.

29:42.149 --> 29:46.550
- We'll clear a path to the sled.
Everybody ready ?

29:48.150 --> 29:49.481
- One, two-

29:49.681 --> 29:53.416
Wait. No, no.
Stop.

29:53.516 --> 29:57.249
- I think they are the Gauol.

30:02.483 --> 30:05.217
Ahh.

30:09.949 --> 30:11.083
Over here !

30:11.183 --> 30:13.350
Quick little devil.

30:13.450 --> 30:16.050
- Okay, all I have to do is tap
into the central computer,

30:16.150 --> 30:18.150
and we can figure
the departure protocols.

30:18.250 --> 30:22.084
- Yes. Making progress.
Yes, I'm making progress.

30:22.184 --> 30:24.685
Huh ? Wait, wait.

30:24.785 --> 30:27.249
- Hmm.

30:27.349 --> 30:30.350
Ooh. Hmm.

30:52.650 --> 30:58.218
The moon, the moon, the moon. Right,
yeah. That's how we knew to come here.

30:59.018 --> 31:01.985
My father made a map
with that moon on it.

31:02.085 --> 31:05.450
Now, why ? Is the ship
hidden there ?

31:08.584 --> 31:12.052
Ohh.

31:13.518 --> 31:16.353
- Oh.

31:25.351 --> 31:28.185
Hmm. Ahh.

31:32.353 --> 31:35.553
It must be somewhere
in the Andali Nebula.

31:38.053 --> 31:39.920
We did it, kid.

31:40.020 --> 31:43.185
The Titan is as good
as ours.

31:43.285 --> 31:46.985
He must have been here, standing here.
Right here.

31:47.085 --> 31:50.652
- Who ?
- My father.

31:54.820 --> 31:56.820
Go !

32:00.585 --> 32:03.719
Let's move it !

32:04.419 --> 32:06.720
We've gotta
get to the beach !

32:39.519 --> 32:40.353
- Akima !

32:57.854 --> 33:01.088
- Why aren't they shooting at Cale ?
- They want him alive.

33:01.188 --> 33:04.688
Come on, guys.
Pick it up. Pick it up.

33:20.788 --> 33:22.789
Nice catch.

33:32.590 --> 33:34.323
Pull up ! Pull up !

34:03.857 --> 34:06.457
Preed, come in !
Preed, where are you ?

34:06.557 --> 34:08.724
- Hold on !

34:10.623 --> 34:14.089
- Preed, come in !

34:14.789 --> 34:17.989
- Preed !

34:20.556 --> 34:25.324
Preed, Preed, Preed ! Aren't you
supposed to be watching for the Drej ?

34:25.424 --> 34:29.391
Yes, caveman, that's right.
Drej bad. We good.

34:29.491 --> 34:32.688
- Now, go look at
something shiny for a while.

34:32.789 --> 34:35.290
- How's this ?

34:35.422 --> 34:38.623
- Well, you'd better look again !

34:41.491 --> 34:42.424
Drej !

34:42.524 --> 34:45.224
- Aah !

35:06.292 --> 35:08.693
Captain, we're on our way.
Where are you ?

35:08.791 --> 35:11.357
We're in the
hydrogen trees being chased by the Drej.

35:11.657 --> 35:13.992
- See if you can spot them, quick !
- Look there !

35:17.626 --> 35:19.759
- Akima !
- Hang on !

35:29.124 --> 35:31.158
Nice move.

35:36.058 --> 35:37.725
Get down !

35:43.159 --> 35:45.627
Come on.
Show yourselves.

35:48.058 --> 35:50.026
- Get down !
- Cale !

35:52.659 --> 35:54.859
- I got 'em.

35:57.126 --> 35:59.093
Whoa !

35:59.494 --> 36:02.094
Preed, look !
There they are !

36:04.195 --> 36:05.992
Oh, no.

36:08.493 --> 36:13.094
- Hang on, Akima !

36:15.194 --> 36:17.694
Don't shoot !

36:17.827 --> 36:20.395
Don't shoot !
They've got Cale !

36:25.692 --> 36:28.992
Gune, calculate their trajectory.
Stith, take weapons.

36:29.093 --> 36:32.027
- Let's get on it, people.
- Oh, nice job covering our butts, Preed.

36:32.126 --> 36:35.394
- You're the weapons expert.
- What were you doing ? Taking a nap ?

36:35.494 --> 36:39.128
Enough ! Okay,
the Drej took Cale.

36:39.228 --> 36:41.961
But they are not
gonna get away with it.

36:42.095 --> 36:45.227
Well, let's quit running
our collective mouths and go get him.

36:45.360 --> 36:50.694
Our only chance to locate them
is to track Akima. Stith, get on it.

36:55.695 --> 36:57.595
Hmm.

36:58.195 --> 37:01.129
They're gonna use you to figure out
where the Titan is.

37:02.428 --> 37:06.061
Probably just blow it up,
too, when they find it.

37:06.161 --> 37:10.995
- Yeah, well, who's to say
it would've worked, anyway ?
- Who's to say it won't ?

37:11.995 --> 37:15.496
Maybe Korso will get
to the Titan first.

37:15.596 --> 37:18.396
Why do you care so much
about that thing ?

37:19.697 --> 37:22.361
I was raised
around people.

37:22.460 --> 37:25.961
"Drifter Colony bums",
I believe, is the term.

37:28.228 --> 37:33.062
I barely remember Earth, but the older
ones used to tell us about it...

37:33.162 --> 37:36.196
so it would never
be completely lost.

37:36.696 --> 37:40.095
No matter how hard things got-
and they were hard-

37:40.195 --> 37:43.262
those memories
kept us going.

37:43.362 --> 37:46.796
Once, we had a home.

37:48.196 --> 37:51.796
The Titan is our chance
to find one again.

37:55.130 --> 37:58.097
I guess that's how
I ended up here.

37:58.197 --> 38:02.496
What are they afraid of ? So what did
the human race ever do to the Drej ?

38:02.596 --> 38:06.697
- It's not what we did. They're afraid
of what we might become.
- Hmm.

38:06.797 --> 38:10.097
Yeah, well, looks like
we're becoming extinct.

38:58.131 --> 39:01.398
- Cale, you okay ?

39:03.298 --> 39:04.599
- Akima !

39:09.066 --> 39:11.499
Cale !

40:07.968 --> 40:11.699
- Cale !
- No ! Stop !

40:15.966 --> 40:18.633
Leave her alone !

40:21.500 --> 40:23.134
Akima !

40:27.034 --> 40:27.868
No !

40:54.467 --> 40:59.435
Akima's signal is
getting stronger. I think it's
coming from the slave cages.

41:01.602 --> 41:04.036
- A Drej pod. What's in it ?
- A human.

41:04.136 --> 41:06.603
- She's mine. I saw her first.

41:07.704 --> 41:09.167
- Pretty.

41:12.300 --> 41:14.601
Ah. All right.

41:14.735 --> 41:20.369
- I'll take out the guard.
- Easy, big girl.
This requires cunning and deception.

41:21.168 --> 41:22.769
- Hello.
- Ah.

41:23.469 --> 41:25.869
Uh, I'm an Akrennian trader.

41:25.969 --> 41:30.268
I wonder if we might sneak
a peek at the new shipment
before they go on the market ?

41:30.768 --> 41:34.068
- You're not allowed.
- Traditionally, no.
You're absolutely right.

41:34.169 --> 41:37.669
But you see,
I need a new slave rather badly.

41:37.803 --> 41:40.837
- Stop fidgeting, worm !

41:40.970 --> 41:44.404
And I can't wait till auction.
I have to be on the shuttle.

41:44.504 --> 41:48.436
I have an appointment
to have my ear shaved.
It has to be booked months in advance.

41:48.569 --> 41:52.403
- You see my problem.
- Hmm.

41:52.103 --> 41:55.570
You're lying. He's not a slave,
and you're not traders.

41:55.670 --> 41:57.604
- But-
- He doesn't carry himself
like a slave.

41:57.704 --> 42:00.637
- Look at the way he stands.
Probably ex-military.
- How-

42:00.738 --> 42:03.305
Akrennian traders always threaten before
they ask a favor. It's tradition.

42:04.204 --> 42:06.403
- And your robes are made
out of bedspreads.

42:06.503 --> 42:11.969
- Ah. - Just out of curiosity,
did we have a plan "B" ?

42:20.604 --> 42:23.936
- Hmm. An intelligent guard.
Didn't see that one coming.

43:07.537 --> 43:09.638
Whoa.

43:58.475 --> 43:59.205
- This is it.

43:59.605 --> 44:02.506
- Are you in there ?

44:04.673 --> 44:08.874
Well, if it isn't the captain.
What kept you ?

45:31.910 --> 45:36.209
Do you see anything ? It was really
small, like a cocoon or something.

45:36.342 --> 45:38.909
No, no, no.
Nothing like that. No. Mmm.

45:39.010 --> 45:41.710
I do see something.

45:41.843 --> 45:44.910
Oh, no. Just a Drej ship.
Drej !

45:45.010 --> 45:47.810
- What ? Where ?
- I'm on it. I'm on it. I'm on it.

45:47.910 --> 45:50.809
- Korso, we have a problem.
You'd better get up here.

45:50.909 --> 45:53.809
- I'm here. I'm here.
What's the problem ?

45:53.909 --> 45:56.809
- Stith, let's go.
- All right. All right.

45:57.309 --> 45:59.643
- I've locked on to him, sir.
- Gune, look out for his buddy.

45:59.743 --> 46:03.643
- There's only one.
He's all alone. Just one.
- Three, five, twenty-two-

46:04.043 --> 46:06.977
- Three, five, twenty-two,
seventy-four, eleven.

46:07.811 --> 46:11.043
- Cale !
- Die, Drej scumball !

46:11.176 --> 46:13.410
Oh, don't-
No, don't shoot. Oh, guys-

46:13.543 --> 46:15.610
- Come on. It's me !
- It's Cale !

46:15.710 --> 46:17.610
- Cale !
- Stith, hold your fire !

46:20.477 --> 46:22.411
- Oops.

46:22.511 --> 46:25.345
Akima,
open the cargo bay.

46:37.411 --> 46:38.611
Cale !

46:42.079 --> 46:46.813
- Ah ! The boy is not dead.
This is cause for happiness.
- Hmm.

46:47.712 --> 46:50.477
So, um- how did you escape ?

46:50.577 --> 46:54.378
- He got lucky.
- You know, we were just
about to rescue you.

46:55.178 --> 46:57.311
- Yeah ? Well, thanks.

46:57.411 --> 47:01.912
- Anytime.
- Look, uh, they copied the map.

47:02.012 --> 47:05.313
- I'm sure they're heading
for the Titan now.

47:05.412 --> 47:08.811
They won't find it.
Stations, people.

47:09.811 --> 47:13.011
Yes. Going, going.

47:14.779 --> 47:16.945
Akima ?

47:17.079 --> 47:21.179
Uh, um, what happened ?
How'd you get back ?

47:21.279 --> 47:24.713
I got picked up with the trash.
Luckily, Korso got there...

47:24.812 --> 47:28.712
before I ended up as a door prize
in some alien freak show.

47:32.046 --> 47:34.347
I guess I owe him one.

47:34.446 --> 47:39.247
You know, we both
got real lucky back there.

47:39.747 --> 47:42.681
- But the next time around-
- Cale.

47:43.381 --> 47:46.346
Come on.
Gune needs a hand.

47:46.578 --> 47:50.779
- Yes, the map is good.
The map is different.

47:50.879 --> 47:53.513
- Yes, the map is clear.

47:53.646 --> 47:57.780
- Yes, it's very, very clear.
- Ooh. Take it easy.

47:57.880 --> 48:01.381
Hmm. This outer marking
is pulsing.

48:01.481 --> 48:06.946
- Ah, the distal Phalangial Meridian.
- Gune, what do you make of it ?

48:07.347 --> 48:10.913
Past outer quadrant.

48:11.014 --> 48:16.114
This is the Ice Rings of Tigrin.
Right here. Hmm.

48:16.714 --> 48:20.448
- Easy to get lost in there.
- Good hiding place.

48:41.846 --> 48:44.080
What ?

48:46.180 --> 48:48.748
- Wakeangels.

48:49.148 --> 48:53.581
They follow ships into deep space,
glide on the energywake.

48:53.715 --> 48:57.416
- They're supposed to be good luck.

48:58.949 --> 49:00.947
They're like... ghosts.

49:01.047 --> 49:03.914
Sit down. Why don't
you give 'em a run ?

49:04.014 --> 49:08.016
- You sure about that ?
- 'Course I'm sure.

49:07.815 --> 49:10.449
Okay.

49:10.549 --> 49:13.783
<i> It's my time to fly </i>

49:13.883 --> 49:17.017
<i> I'm proving ground
tonight </i>

49:17.117 --> 49:21.948
<i> I'll try to be the best
that I can </i>

49:22.048 --> 49:25.149
Yeah. You got it.
Open her up.

49:25.249 --> 49:29.550
- Give these angels something to chase.
- All right.

49:29.683 --> 49:31.683
Try this, guys.

49:33.084 --> 49:35.884
<i> It's my time to fly </i>

49:35.984 --> 49:38.982
<i> My father will be
with me tonight </i>

49:39.082 --> 49:41.149
<i> Ooh </i>

49:41.249 --> 49:45.282
<i> We're right on target </i>

49:45.383 --> 49:48.416
<i> It's my time to fly </i>

49:48.516 --> 49:53.150
<i> My father will
be with us tonight </i>

49:53.250 --> 49:55.916
<i> A chance tonight </i>

49:59.316 --> 50:01.783
<i> To victory </i>

50:01.916 --> 50:04.917
<i> Dreams become reality </i>
<i> Reality </i>

50:05.850 --> 50:08.884
<i> It's my time to fly </i>

50:08.984 --> 50:12.252
<i> My father will be
with me tonight </i>

50:12.352 --> 50:18.084
<i> Ooh, I'm right on target </i>

50:18.184 --> 50:21.418
<i> It's my time to fly </i>

50:21.517 --> 50:24.984
<i> My father will be
with us tonight </i>

50:27.784 --> 50:30.452
<i> It's my time to fly </i>

50:30.552 --> 50:33.752
<i> My father will be
with me tonight </i>

50:33.916 --> 50:39.583
<i> Ooh, we're right on target </i>

50:40.184 --> 50:43.317
<i> It's my time to fly </i>

50:43.417 --> 50:46.452
<i> My father will be
with me tonight </i>

50:46.552 --> 50:48.619
<i> Ooh </i>

50:48.718 --> 50:51.786
<i> I'm right on target </i>

50:56.168 --> 50:59.651
- Thank you.
- I knew you could handle this old bird.

50:59.751 --> 51:02.385
No, I mean-
I mean, thank you for-

51:02.485 --> 51:06.585
Thank you for trying to find me.
It's more than my father ever did.

51:07.219 --> 51:10.420
Your father was a great man,
Cale.

51:12.253 --> 51:14.118
- He would've been proud of ya.

51:14.552 --> 51:18.019
- You really think so ?
- Trust me.

51:19.719 --> 51:22.153
Thanks. Thanks.

51:27.620 --> 51:29.954
You know, I-
I miss him.

51:34.185 --> 51:35.786
Me too.

52:31.487 --> 52:33.587
Akima ?

52:34.187 --> 52:39.355
Akima ? Huh ?
Oh, uh, uh, uh, sorry.

52:40.155 --> 52:45.023
- In or out ?
- Huh ? Oh, uh, in.

52:48.587 --> 52:53.521
Uh, what's going on ?
Do you know why we stopped ?

52:53.654 --> 52:56.288
Pit stop for the basics.
Drifter Colony's the best place...

52:56.388 --> 53:02.156
to pick up plasmapacks,
fuelcells, frozen burritos.

53:02.256 --> 53:06.321
Listen. I need
to talk to you, and-

53:07.621 --> 53:09.555
Where'd you get all this junk ?

53:10.855 --> 53:13.389
Not junk.

53:14.289 --> 53:17.789
Why don't you come with me ?
I'll show you.

53:22.721 --> 53:27.054
So, we're gonna barter this stuff
for more of that Earthjunk ?

53:27.388 --> 53:32.255
Don't you get it, Cale ?
That junk is all that's left
of the place we came from.

53:33.456 --> 53:36.423
It reminds us of
all the things we miss.

53:36.523 --> 53:40.923
Mm, miss. Like those frozen burritos
you were talking about.

53:41.623 --> 53:43.756
- At least they don't
jump off your plate.

53:43.855 --> 53:46.556
You think this is some game ?
Did you forget the plan ?

53:46.656 --> 53:51.523
I get you the Titan;
I get rich. We had a deal, right ?

53:51.623 --> 53:55.457
- How dare you try
to cut me out like that ?

53:58.258 --> 54:03.156
Yeah ? Do as you please, and
guess what. You'll retrieve nothing.

54:03.256 --> 54:07.691
You don't have the whole map.
The kid's got it. And I've got the kid.

54:07.791 --> 54:10.257
So you keep your drones
off my back,

54:10.357 --> 54:13.125
or so help me,
I'll rip his heart out.

54:14.391 --> 54:16.625
Cale, come on.

54:16.725 --> 54:18.959
Going somewhere ?

54:19.955 --> 54:25.790
Look what I've found:
two little birdies itchy to fly.

54:25.923 --> 54:29.358
- How long were they standing there ?
- Long enough.

54:29.491 --> 54:31.925
You lied ?

54:32.057 --> 54:34.825
Everything you said ?
Everything you told me ?

54:34.858 --> 54:38.525
Not everything.
Your father hid his ship,

54:38.625 --> 54:42.224
then the Drej killed him,
all because he couldn't face the truth.

54:42.324 --> 54:48.125
- Yeah ? What is the truth ?
- That the human race is out of
gas. It's circlin' the drain.

54:48.225 --> 54:51.658
It's finished.
The only thing that matters
is grabbin' what you can...

54:51.758 --> 54:54.659
before somebody else
beats you to it.

54:54.959 --> 54:56.893
No, I don't believe that !

54:57.026 --> 55:01.992
Then you're even more like
your father than I thought. A fool.

55:03.525 --> 55:06.925
- Cale !

55:12.093 --> 55:13.694
- Akima, come on !
- Stop them.

55:19.658 --> 55:22.525
Stay on 'em.
I'll lock it down.

55:26.492 --> 55:29.259
- Hurry !
- Go ! Go !

55:37.358 --> 55:40.459
- Akima ! Akima ?

55:57.393 --> 56:01.661
Let's go.
We got a ship to find.

56:02.261 --> 56:03.694
Let's get airborne,
now.

56:03.728 --> 56:06.461
- Where's Cale and Akima ?
- They're not coming.

56:06.561 --> 56:08.628
- Why not ?
- Because they're afraid.

56:08.728 --> 56:12.229
Afraid ? What exactly are they afraid of ?

56:12.362 --> 56:17.226
They're afraid of what might happen
if my command was ever questioned.

56:17.726 --> 56:18.426
- Get it ?

56:18.526 --> 56:21.660
- Got it.
- You got a problem with that ?

56:22.660 --> 56:24.460
No.

56:27.595 --> 56:30.862
- Why they not say good-bye to Gune ?

56:43.295 --> 56:47.529
- Go get a blanket, quickly.
She needs warmth.
- Something to keep her warm.

56:47.629 --> 56:49.029
You, go get a doctor.

56:49.129 --> 56:51.527
- Yeah. Hurry.
- Cover her.

56:52.205 --> 56:53.627
- Yes, yes.
- What did you tell him ?

56:53.727 --> 56:55.961
I asked him
to bring corn liquor.

56:56.061 --> 56:58.095
No. Really,
I don't need it.

56:58.195 --> 57:00.863
Ha ! Not for you.
For boy.

57:00.962 --> 57:03.029
- Me ?
- He pass out soon.

57:04.329 --> 57:07.930
- She'll be fine. She just
needs rest. Don't worry.

57:08.330 --> 57:10.261
She'll be fine.

57:19.296 --> 57:20.828
Hey !

57:27.696 --> 57:30.461
It's his favorite thing in the world-

57:30.562 --> 57:32.662
that stupid ball.

57:32.762 --> 57:35.163
It was our dad's
back on Earth.

57:35.563 --> 57:37.163
Every time
he kicks that thing,

57:37.263 --> 57:39.896
my brother thinks
he's in a big grass field.

57:40.796 --> 57:42.064
That's some imagination.

57:42.164 --> 57:47.729
Yeah, well. - There. He had
a little help. See what I mean ?

57:51.096 --> 57:53.197
That's him - our dad.

57:53.297 --> 57:55.697
That's where my brother
got the idea.

57:56.797 --> 57:57.831
Hmm.

57:57.931 --> 58:00.297
Here on the colony,
most people got to shut their eyes...

58:00.397 --> 58:04.232
to see anything other
than rusted spaceship hulls.

58:04.332 --> 58:06.462
Not my brother.

58:08.996 --> 58:10.696
Later.

58:24.131 --> 58:27.764
- Hey. Sleeping Beauty.
- How long was I out ?

58:27.897 --> 58:30.731
Not long.
A few hours.

58:31.531 --> 58:34.665
Korso and Preed. I can't believe it.

58:35.465 --> 58:37.965
How long before
they reach the Titan ?

58:38.765 --> 58:42.399
They won't.
We're gonna beat them to it.

58:42.499 --> 58:45.564
Akima, we're gonna
stop them.

58:46.665 --> 58:50.064
Was I seriously injured
back there or something,

58:50.165 --> 58:53.465
'cause, funny, I thought you just said
we're gonna stop them ?

58:53.965 --> 58:58.232
- That's right.
- Cale, we're in the middle of nowhere.

58:58.312 --> 59:02.766
There's just the two of us,
and, oh, yeah - we don't have a ship.

59:02.867 --> 59:05.298
- Oh, we've got a ship.
- Really ?

59:05.398 --> 59:08.098
- Mm-hmm.
- I'd like to see this... ship.

59:08.198 --> 59:10.598
Check it out.

59:11.199 --> 59:15.265
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes!

59:19.700 --> 59:23.698
Well, she's been a great house,
but I don't think she'll fly.

59:27.432 --> 59:30.766
Well, she's still got her ionic
vacuum drive. Those never drain.

59:30.899 --> 59:34.133
- This thing's a wreck.
- I can fix it, but do you think-

59:34.233 --> 59:36.233
Don't worry.
I can fly it.

59:36.334 --> 59:39.134
Good, 'cause
we launch yesterday.

59:40.734 --> 59:43.300
<i> I've gotta get away from here </i>

59:43.900 --> 59:47.033
<i> It couldn't be too soon </i>

59:48.133 --> 59:51.033
<i> 'Cause I've seen the stars
for you and me </i>

59:51.434 --> 59:55.735
<i> Like rockets
to the moon </i>

59:55.835 --> 01:00:00.298
<i> You take me everywhere
that I've never been </i>

01:00:00.832 --> 01:00:05.933
<i> Show me the meaning
of what life had to give </i>

01:00:05.967 --> 01:00:08.800
<i> I don't know
what to say </i>

01:00:08.900 --> 01:00:14.501
<i> I think that maybe
I'm in over my head </i>

01:00:14.601 --> 01:00:19.400
<i> Stuck in the bed
somethin' she said </i>
- Ow !

01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:24.667
<i> Makes me think
that I'm in over my head </i>

01:00:24.767 --> 01:00:27.001
<i> Over my head </i>

01:00:27.101 --> 01:00:30.001
T-minus ten, nine,

01:00:30.101 --> 01:00:33.035
eight, seven,

01:00:33.135 --> 01:00:35.102
- six, five,
- Well, we're good to go.

01:00:35.935 --> 01:00:38.534
- four, three,
- Let's hope she starts.

01:00:38.634 --> 01:00:40.534
- two,
- Oh, she'll start.

01:00:40.634 --> 01:00:43.868
- one, zero.
- Yeah, right.

01:00:49.535 --> 01:00:52.870
- She'll start.

01:00:52.970 --> 01:00:55.704
Uh, I'd lean back
if I were you.

01:00:58.203 --> 01:01:00.301
- Should I get out and push ?

01:01:10.936 --> 01:01:15.502
- Told ya.
- Okay. You did your job.
Now let me do mine.

01:01:41.837 --> 01:01:44.403
These collisions keep slowing us down.

01:01:44.504 --> 01:01:49.238
- So where is it ?
- My scanners are picking up
a veritable cornucopia of... nothing.

01:01:49.338 --> 01:01:53.135
Just find it !
Gune, are you sure about that map ?

01:01:53.236 --> 01:01:57.236
You give me map. I follow map.
What more can Gune do ?

01:01:57.336 --> 01:02:02.103
- If Professor Screwloose over there
led us off course, I'm going to-
- Hold it !

01:02:02.203 --> 01:02:04.037
- What is it ?
- A ship. Three keks east.

01:02:04.137 --> 01:02:08.237
- Drej ?
- No. Human craft, heading
for the break zone. Moving fast.

01:02:08.337 --> 01:02:11.072
- How fast ?
- I'd say recklessly fast.

01:02:11.672 --> 01:02:14.136
- Akima.
- Ah, good !

01:02:14.236 --> 01:02:17.071
Akima. Cale.
I- I hail on communicator.

01:02:17.203 --> 01:02:19.204
No hailing.
Just follow them.

01:02:19.304 --> 01:02:23.238
Okay. I follow, but I plot
new route through safer quadrant.

01:02:23.971 --> 01:02:26.605
- If we-

01:02:26.705 --> 01:02:29.105
- We're going to follow them,

01:02:29.505 --> 01:02:32.971
and we'll run silent.

01:02:41.606 --> 01:02:44.272
The reflections
are throwing my readings off.

01:02:47.239 --> 01:02:50.270
Uh, Akima, I think
we're getting closer.

01:02:54.438 --> 01:02:57.005
- Cale ! It's Korso.
- Huh ?

01:02:57.105 --> 01:02:59.239
- He's right behind us.
- What ?

01:03:04.106 --> 01:03:06.939
We've got to lose him.

01:03:16.939 --> 01:03:21.407
- We'll never find them in there.
- We're going in.

01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:29.005
- Stith, where are they ?
- I can't get a reading.

01:03:29.105 --> 01:03:33.306
There's too much ice,
too much interference, Captain.

01:03:35.807 --> 01:03:38.306
- Captain.
- Whoa !

01:04:04.341 --> 01:04:07.073
A heat signature.
I see them !

01:04:07.173 --> 01:04:09.140
- Where are they ?
- Behind us !

01:04:27.541 --> 01:04:30.008
- No !

01:04:38.575 --> 01:04:40.010
Where is he ?

01:04:40.110 --> 01:04:42.143
I- I don't know.

01:04:48.841 --> 01:04:52.908
- What ?
- Well, we found them, Captain.

01:04:53.008 --> 01:04:55.475
No more heat readings.
All gone.

01:04:55.575 --> 01:05:00.342
Until they make their move,
we stay here.

01:05:16.243 --> 01:05:20.310
- They're moving out, I think.
- Now we've got 'em.

01:05:30.343 --> 01:05:34.977
- I can't move. They'll see us.
- Maybe that's exactly what we want.

01:05:39.975 --> 01:05:42.642
A reading !
Yeah. They're right in front of us.

01:05:42.776 --> 01:05:45.643
You're not gonna
get past me, kid.

01:05:45.743 --> 01:05:49.476
- There, Captain !
- That's right, Cale. Keep coming.

01:05:49.576 --> 01:05:51.910
Closer.
They're getting closer !

01:05:52.210 --> 01:05:54.544
There she is, Captain.

01:05:56.711 --> 01:05:59.309
No. There, Captain.

01:06:00.376 --> 01:06:03.043
Which one ?

01:06:16.546 --> 01:06:19.177
Look !
They're behind us now !

01:06:26.111 --> 01:06:28.411
- Ready lasers !
- I'm on it !

01:06:31.545 --> 01:06:35.413
I need one clear shot.
Don't lose 'em.

01:07:05.045 --> 01:07:07.079
- Ice ! Turn back !
- No way.

01:07:07.179 --> 01:07:10.346
- We'll never make it through.
- We don't have a choice.

01:07:11.447 --> 01:07:14.411
- Akima ! Uh-
- Yes, Cale ?

01:07:14.545 --> 01:07:17.012
- Pull up !
- Shut up !

01:07:30.281 --> 01:07:32.114
Let's not
do that again.

01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:42.280
Hold it.
Look there.

01:07:49.548 --> 01:07:51.713
Akima, turn around.
Turn around !

01:08:29.203 --> 01:08:31.145
That's it.

01:08:35.314 --> 01:08:40.015
Wow. Have you ever
seen anything like it ?

01:08:42.015 --> 01:08:43.481
Once.

01:09:02.350 --> 01:09:07.415
- What exactly are we looking for ?
- This ship's gonna
help us save mankind.

01:09:07.514 --> 01:09:11.683
- What exactly are we looking for ?
- Not a clue.

01:09:12.582 --> 01:09:14.683
DNA coding.

01:09:14.783 --> 01:09:18.450
"Mammal.
Tursiops truncatus."

01:09:18.550 --> 01:09:20.684
The bottle-nosed dolphin.

01:09:20.783 --> 01:09:24.018
These are animals-
or- or they will be.

01:09:27.048 --> 01:09:31.082
"Leopard.
Papilio glaucus."

01:09:31.816 --> 01:09:34.948
Swallowtail butterfly.
It's all here.

01:09:36.483 --> 01:09:40.050
- Cale ?
- I'm over here !

01:09:43.484 --> 01:09:45.381
Look at this.

01:09:49.448 --> 01:09:51.649
Dad.

01:10:01.218 --> 01:10:04.450
I could never have done anything
like this when I was your age.

01:10:04.583 --> 01:10:07.251
- I wonder who you take after ?

01:10:32.051 --> 01:10:34.118
Hey.

01:10:47.785 --> 01:10:50.852
- The Titan. Quick.
- Ready to go, Captain.

01:10:50.952 --> 01:10:53.986
You two stay here.
Preed and I can wrap this up.

01:10:54.086 --> 01:10:58.453
- But- Here. Hold on to this
in case there's any trouble.

01:10:58.553 --> 01:11:01.951
Hmm.
N-N-N-N-No.

01:11:02.051 --> 01:11:04.419
Those two are
becoming a problem.

01:11:04.952 --> 01:11:07.519
- We need to take care of it.

01:11:07.653 --> 01:11:10.186
I'm one step
ahead of you.

01:11:12.153 --> 01:11:16.920
- Watch the ship.
I always watch the ship.
- No, this just doesn't feel right.

01:11:17.021 --> 01:11:19.884
- I wanna go ! I wanna go !
- Captain said stay.

01:11:19.984 --> 01:11:22.818
It's Captain I don't trust.

01:11:22.918 --> 01:11:26.319
Hmm. You know,
you may be right. Come on.

01:11:28.119 --> 01:11:28.853
- Stith here.

01:11:28.953 --> 01:11:32.854
- Stith,
is Gune right there with you ?
- Yeah.

01:11:32.953 --> 01:11:36.553
- Then please tell him good-bye
for me, won't you ?
- What ?

01:11:39.154 --> 01:11:39.753
- Gune !

01:11:39.852 --> 01:11:43.752
- I knew it ! I knew it ! - Get out of there !

01:12:00.220 --> 01:12:06.488
- Cale. If this message has-
- Dad ?

01:12:06.588 --> 01:12:09.755
If this message has been activated,
then I have died before finding you.

01:12:11.455 --> 01:12:12.956
I hope
you can forgive me...

01:12:13.056 --> 01:12:15.986
for breaking my promise
to see you again.

01:12:16.020 --> 01:12:18.720
What I wouldn't give
to see you now.

01:12:18.820 --> 01:12:23.854
I can't change the past, Cale,
but I hope I can give you a future.

01:12:25.221 --> 01:12:29.854
This ship has the power
to create a planet,

01:12:29.954 --> 01:12:33.055
to create a new home.

01:12:33.155 --> 01:12:37.054
Your ring would have activated
the transformation sequence,

01:12:37.154 --> 01:12:40.421
but the Titan's power cells
were drained in the escape.

01:12:40.521 --> 01:12:45.221
They are unable
to fuel the transformation.

01:12:45.355 --> 01:12:48.389
It is up to you
to restore their power.

01:12:48.823 --> 01:12:51.623
After that,
the procedure is simple.

01:12:53.257 --> 01:12:55.688
- He always did talk too much.

01:12:57.255 --> 01:12:59.922
- Oh !
- Ah-Ah-Ah.

01:13:01.256 --> 01:13:05.990
Korso, don't do this.
This ship is all we have left.
Doesn't that mean anything to you ?

01:13:06.090 --> 01:13:08.757
Sorry, kid.
World blowing up changes a man.

01:13:08.857 --> 01:13:12.021
- Look. The Drej-
- See, you can't beat the Drej.

01:13:12.121 --> 01:13:14.421
No one can.
They're pure energy.

01:13:15.121 --> 01:13:18.522
Face it, Cale.
You've lost.

01:13:18.955 --> 01:13:22.589
- Actually, you all have.

01:13:22.422 --> 01:13:25.623
Captain, if you'll relieve yourself
of your firearm-

01:13:27.123 --> 01:13:29.656
- You backstabbing-
- Well, I learned from the best.

01:13:30.090 --> 01:13:33.456
But it wasn't just the money
the Drej were offering.

01:13:33.756 --> 01:13:36.122
It was the health plan
that came with it.

01:13:36.522 --> 01:13:41.390
They'd let me live provided
I kill all of you before they get here.

01:13:42.991 --> 01:13:45.291
They should be here shortly.

01:13:56.658 --> 01:14:00.357
- Gune ? Gune ?

01:14:00.691 --> 01:14:03.825
- Gune !

01:14:06.192 --> 01:14:10.390
- Gune, are you all right ?
- I'm- I'm all right f-for business.

01:14:10.490 --> 01:14:14.591
- Gune.
- I'll just take a little nap...

01:14:14.691 --> 01:14:20.424
since I'm so- very sleepy.

01:14:20.524 --> 01:14:23.224
Ahh.

01:14:23.324 --> 01:14:26.126
- Preed, you can't trust the Drej.
- Akima.

01:14:26.258 --> 01:14:31.091
Oh, stop ! There's nothing more
tiresome than last-minute heroics !

01:14:47.758 --> 01:14:51.359
- Captain ? Mm. Oh.

01:14:55.125 --> 01:14:58.360
- Hide 'n' seek, is it ?
Or should we play...

01:14:58.460 --> 01:15:00.360
search and destroy !

01:15:00.460 --> 01:15:02.960
- Preed !
- Ah !

01:15:14.492 --> 01:15:18.560
- Give me the ring.
- Aw. You're not gonna shoot me, kid.

01:15:40.694 --> 01:15:44.326
- Cale !
- Ah. Aah !

01:15:48.793 --> 01:15:52.161
Hold on !
Oh !

01:15:52.460 --> 01:15:55.494
You can let go, kid.
I wouldn't blame you.

01:15:55.594 --> 01:15:58.861
No ! I'm not
gonna let go !

01:16:03.659 --> 01:16:06.693
- Korso !

01:16:11.261 --> 01:16:13.260
- Cale ! The Drej !

01:16:20.729 --> 01:16:22.427
- You okay ?

01:16:23.127 --> 01:16:25.394
- Yeah.

01:16:39.596 --> 01:16:42.328
- Let's not panic.
- We've gotta get out of here
before the Drej arrive.

01:16:42.461 --> 01:16:47.028
- No, I think we're gonna stay right here.
- Right here is about to be blown apart.

01:16:47.128 --> 01:16:49.363
- This could be a good thing. Wait.
- Come on, Cale !

01:16:49.463 --> 01:16:51.830
Wait.
We can make this work.

01:16:53.997 --> 01:16:57.230
- What did Korso say about the Drej ?
- That you can't beat them.

01:16:57.330 --> 01:17:00.028
Right !
Because they're pure energy.

01:17:00.128 --> 01:17:05.228
If I can reroute the system to use Drej
energy, that would start the reactor.

01:17:07.429 --> 01:17:12.363
The energy relays are linked to these
circuit breakers, so this should do it.

01:17:14.963 --> 01:17:18.728
- Yes !
- Are you sure this will work ?

01:17:22.396 --> 01:17:24.330
Come on !
I can fix this !

01:17:24.430 --> 01:17:27.863
I need to get outside.
Can you and Stith cover me ?
I- I just need a little time.

01:17:27.963 --> 01:17:30.864
- How much time ?
- Uh, a few hours !

01:17:30.964 --> 01:17:33.764
What can you do
in a few minutes ?

01:17:46.664 --> 01:17:49.731
- Here they come.
- Not if I can help it.

01:17:57.663 --> 01:18:00.496
- Cale, you're
a sitting duck up there.
- I'm all right.

01:18:10.064 --> 01:18:12.232
- Oh !
- Come on !

01:18:16.063 --> 01:18:19.231
Whoo !

01:18:19.264 --> 01:18:23.665
- Oh, fantastic.
I only have two guns left.
- Let's make 'em count.

01:18:23.465 --> 01:18:27.065
- Akima, I can't shake 'em.
- I've got him.

01:18:35.864 --> 01:18:37.698
Ah ! I'm out !

01:18:40.098 --> 01:18:43.265
Let's do this ! Whoo !

01:18:47.399 --> 01:18:52.764
- Well, guys, it's been fun.
- A little help here, Akima. Whoa !

01:18:55.031 --> 01:18:58.665
- Cale !

01:18:58.799 --> 01:19:02.232
I finished my nap !

01:19:04.599 --> 01:19:08.600
- Gune !
- Who's your daddy ?

01:19:08.700 --> 01:19:11.299
Gune's your daddy !

01:19:13.632 --> 01:19:16.199
Oh, no ! No, no, no, no !

01:19:16.299 --> 01:19:19.366
Oh !

01:19:19.666 --> 01:19:23.633
- Cale, are you all right ?
- I'm pinned.

01:19:23.734 --> 01:19:26.534
- Stith, who's outside with Cale ?

01:19:27.767 --> 01:19:30.133
- Hi, kid.
- It's Korso !

01:19:33.066 --> 01:19:35.233
You'll never get a cleaner shot, Korso.

01:19:44.168 --> 01:19:47.235
Maybe we can beat 'em
after all.

01:19:50.233 --> 01:19:52.499
Go ahead.
I'll cover you.

01:19:52.799 --> 01:19:56.833
Yeah, yeah. Right.

01:20:10.734 --> 01:20:13.034
Okay.

01:20:15.134 --> 01:20:16.634
- Oh, great.

01:20:19.701 --> 01:20:23.202
- Fry, Drej !
- Ah !

01:20:29.367 --> 01:20:31.201
They're leaving.

01:20:34.902 --> 01:20:38.336
Uh-oh.
We got a problem.

01:20:41.603 --> 01:20:44.070
Go. They're
joining the mother ship.

01:20:44.170 --> 01:20:46.900
- But the breaker !
- Cale, she's preparing to fire !

01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:50.768
- You can't stay out here.
- I'll take care of it, so let's move.

01:20:55.269 --> 01:20:57.136
Go on. Get out of here.

01:20:57.236 --> 01:20:59.802
Cale, where are you ?

01:20:59.903 --> 01:21:02.569
Go. It's better this way.

01:21:02.669 --> 01:21:05.068
Uh-

01:21:21.737 --> 01:21:24.536
Here they come again.

01:21:36.371 --> 01:21:39.271
Come on.
Faster. Faster.

01:21:43.171 --> 01:21:43.769
Come on.

01:24:41.875 --> 01:24:43.676
This is amazing.

01:24:47.376 --> 01:24:49.743
I know.

01:24:50.143 --> 01:24:52.241
What are
you going to call it ?

01:24:52.341 --> 01:24:56.009
I think
I'll call it... Bob.

01:24:56.409 --> 01:24:59.575
- Bob ?
- You don't like "Bob" ?

01:24:59.675 --> 01:25:01.676
You can't
call a planet "Bob".

01:25:01.776 --> 01:25:05.243
Oh, so now you're the boss.
You're the king of Bob.

01:25:05.377 --> 01:25:08.277
- Well, no, but-
- What ?

01:25:08.377 --> 01:25:10.275
Can't you just
call it Earth ?

01:25:10.675 --> 01:25:15.442
Well, no one said
you had to live on Bob.

01:25:15.543 --> 01:25:18.110
I'm never...

01:25:18.410 --> 01:25:20.610
calling it that.

01:26:50.212 --> 01:26:52.312
<i> Ohh, oh, oh </i>

01:26:53.112 --> 01:26:55.713
<i> Ohh, oh, oh, oh </i>

01:26:55.813 --> 01:26:58.480
<i> Ohh, oh, oh </i>

01:26:58.580 --> 01:27:00.480
<i> Ohh, oh, oh, oh </i>

01:27:00.580 --> 01:27:03.478
<i> Take the path
of least resistance </i>

01:27:03.578 --> 01:27:06.379
<i> Into the great unknown </i>

01:27:06.479 --> 01:27:10.779
<i> No directory assistance </i>

01:27:10.879 --> 01:27:14.813
<i> Now you're on your own </i>

01:27:14.913 --> 01:27:18.114
<i> But if you're looking
for a new world </i>

01:27:19.381 --> 01:27:24.812
<i> Just open up your eyes </i>

01:27:24.912 --> 01:27:30.846
-  Because it's not quite paradise 
-  No 

01:27:30.946 --> 01:27:33.180
<i> But it sure feels like home </i>

01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:36.447
<i> Not quite paradise </i>

01:27:36.547 --> 01:27:40.613
<i> And we can rent to own </i>

01:27:40.713 --> 01:27:43.246
<i> It'll be all right </i>

01:27:43.346 --> 01:27:48.947
<i> No, it's not quite </i>

01:27:49.481 --> 01:27:54.115
<i> Paradise </i>

01:27:55.248 --> 01:27:57.582
<i> Tomorrow's an illusion </i>

01:27:57.982 --> 01:28:00.647
<i> And yesterday's a dream </i>

01:28:00.747 --> 01:28:04.781
<i> Today is absolution </i>

01:28:04.881 --> 01:28:08.815
<i> But you gotta let it be </i>

01:28:08.915 --> 01:28:12.316
<i> And if you're looking
for the answer </i>

01:28:13.649 --> 01:28:19.147
<i> It's right before your eyes </i>

01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:25.181
-  Although it's not quite paradise 
-  No, oh, no, oh 

01:28:25.281 --> 01:28:27.248
<i> But it sure looks like home </i>

01:28:27.281 --> 01:28:30.782
<i> Not quite paradise </i>

01:28:30.882 --> 01:28:34.782
<i> And we are not alone </i>

01:28:34.882 --> 01:28:37.881
<i> It'll be all right </i>

01:28:37.981 --> 01:28:43.449
<i> No, it's not quite </i>

01:28:43.748 --> 01:28:49.215
<i> Paradise </i>

01:28:49.316 --> 01:28:51.816
<i> Somewhere
from the edge of time </i>

01:28:51.916 --> 01:28:54.883
<i> When the poets gather
words don't rhyme </i>

01:28:54.983 --> 01:28:57.615
<i> I'll call you up and say </i>

01:28:57.748 --> 01:29:00.782
<i> We made it okay </i>

01:29:00.915 --> 01:29:03.283
<i> Somewhere
in the back of your mind </i>

01:29:03.383 --> 01:29:06.149
<i> When you see your demons
come to life </i>

01:29:06.250 --> 01:29:08.984
<i> And the world
just fades away </i>

01:29:09.083 --> 01:29:12.684
<i> You know it's okay </i>

01:29:15.882 --> 01:29:18.015
<i> Ohh, oh, oh </i>

01:29:18.815 --> 01:29:21.449
-  Ohh, oh, oh, oh 
-  It's gonna be okay 

01:29:21.549 --> 01:29:24.183
<i> Ohh, oh, oh </i>

01:29:24.283 --> 01:29:26.417
<i> Ohh, oh, oh, oh </i>

01:29:26.717 --> 01:29:30.217
-  Okay 
-  Oh, oh, oh 

01:29:30.350 --> 01:29:32.250
<i> Oh, oh, oh, oh </i>

01:29:32.350 --> 01:29:35.482
-  Okay 
-  Oh, oh, oh 

01:29:35.816 --> 01:29:37.216
<i> Oh, oh, oh, oh </i>

01:29:37.316 --> 01:29:42.351
-  But it's not quite paradise 
-  Oh, no 

01:29:42.451 --> 01:29:44.518
<i> But it sure feels like home </i>

01:29:44.618 --> 01:29:47.117
<i> Not quite paradise </i>

01:29:47.918 --> 01:29:49.385
<i> We'll make this place
our own </i>

01:29:49.485 --> 01:29:53.783
<i> Not quite paradise </i>

01:29:53.884 --> 01:29:55.984
<i> We can rent to own </i>

01:29:56.084 --> 01:29:59.118
<i> Not quite paradise </i>

01:29:59.218 --> 01:30:00.818
<i> We don't have to be alone </i>

01:30:00.918 --> 01:30:06.751
-  Not quite paradise 
-  No, no 

01:30:06.885 --> 01:30:11.319
-  No, no, no, no 
-  Not quite paradise 

01:30:11.419 --> 01:30:16.717
-  No, no, yeah 
-  Not quite paradise 

01:30:34.718 --> 01:30:37.318
<i> Now we've traveled far </i>

01:30:38.285 --> 01:30:41.786
<i> But are we any nearer </i>

01:30:41.886 --> 01:30:45.453
<i> There's a feelin'
we're reaching for </i>

01:30:45.552 --> 01:30:48.786
<i> In the fields
where it all began </i>

01:30:49.884 --> 01:30:52.419
<i> Listen, do you hear </i>

01:30:53.552 --> 01:30:56.653
<i> I thought I heard a promise </i>

01:30:56.753 --> 01:31:00.386
<i> But that empty feeling grows </i>

01:31:00.486 --> 01:31:04.121
<i> And I'm scared
that I will forget </i>

01:31:04.521 --> 01:31:06.720
<i> But I </i>

01:31:07.521 --> 01:31:10.785
<i> I can remember </i>

01:31:11.985 --> 01:31:14.952
<i> Look around and around </i>

01:31:15.085 --> 01:31:18.253
<i> There's people
still hanging on </i>

01:31:19.820 --> 01:31:23.387
<i> See, it's me
I'm the one </i>

01:31:23.487 --> 01:31:27.319
<i> Believe in me
I've just begun </i>

01:31:27.419 --> 01:31:30.819
<i> We'll be here
when the lights come on </i>

01:31:30.919 --> 01:31:33.487
<i> When it all comes down </i>

01:31:33.787 --> 01:31:36.920
<i> to me and you </i>

01:31:38.587 --> 01:31:41.088
<i> Just a boy and girl </i>

01:31:42.287 --> 01:31:45.321
<i> Trying to
change a cold world </i>

01:31:45.455 --> 01:31:49.087
<i> I don't expect
that you'd understand </i>

01:31:49.487 --> 01:31:52.521
<i> When you look
at this empty land </i>

01:31:53.221 --> 01:31:56.088
<i> But I </i>

01:31:56.221 --> 01:32:00.622
<i> I can remember </i>

01:32:00.722 --> 01:32:03.489
<i> Look around and around </i>

01:32:03.889 --> 01:32:06.887
<i> People still hanging on </i>

01:32:08.420 --> 01:32:10.387
<i> And I </i>

01:32:11.253 --> 01:32:14.721
<i> I can remember them </i>

01:32:15.721 --> 01:32:18.555
<i> Be it night or day </i>

01:32:18.655 --> 01:32:22.389
<i> Like lovers left holding on </i>

01:32:23.287 --> 01:32:27.221
<i> You see it's me
I'm the one </i>

01:32:27.321 --> 01:32:30.821
<i> Believe in me
I've just begun </i>

01:32:30.922 --> 01:32:34.655

01:33:01.257 --> 01:33:03.755

01:33:03.855 --> 01:33:07.056

01:33:08.222 --> 01:33:11.156

01:33:11.256 --> 01:33:14.556

01:33:33.824 --> 01:33:38.058

<i> Andonandonandonandon </i>

01:33:49.825 --> 01:33:53.491
<i> On andonandonandon </i>

01:33:53.592 --> 01:33:56.725
-  I remember 
-  On andonandon 

01:33:56.859 --> 01:34:00.023
<i> You keep me holding on </i>

01:34:00.157 --> 01:34:04.790
-  You keep me holding on 
-  Andonandonandonandon 

01:34:04.923 --> 01:34:08.458
