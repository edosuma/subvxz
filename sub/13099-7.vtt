WEBVTT

00:07.583 --> 00:10.917
It is a pleasure to meet you.

00:11.000 --> 00:14.458
It is a pleasure to meet you.

00:14.542 --> 00:17.750
It is a pleasure to meet you.

00:17.833 --> 00:19.333
Gonna introduce me, Vir?

00:19.417 --> 00:22.792
Ah, I know I must look
a little odd right now.

00:22.875 --> 00:25.458
Well, uh,
I guess it's all relative.

00:25.542 --> 00:27.792
A-actually, it's relatives.

00:27.875 --> 00:30.417
I'm here to pick up some women.

00:30.500 --> 00:31.708
You'll have better luck at bars.

00:31.792 --> 00:33.792
- No, no, I-I mean--
- Just kidding.

00:33.875 --> 00:35.750
[laughs]
Oh.

00:35.833 --> 00:37.750
So who are these women?
Uh, diplomats?

00:37.833 --> 00:40.375
Uh, Ambassador Mollari's
three wives.

00:40.458 --> 00:44.208
A harem.
Oh, the lucky dog.

00:44.292 --> 00:46.125
- You are Vir?
- Yes.

00:46.208 --> 00:48.625
I am Timov, daughter of Algul.

00:48.708 --> 00:51.000
You will take me to my husband.

00:51.083 --> 00:52.917
I was told
there would be three of you.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.792
Who is this? No, never mind.

00:54.875 --> 00:57.083
I said you will bring me
to my husband.

00:57.167 --> 00:58.958
Is your hearing deficient?

00:59.042 --> 01:01.958
- No, but I do have--
- Then let's be off.

01:02.042 --> 01:04.583
It is a pleasure to meet you.

01:06.375 --> 01:07.750
Should have put the emphasis
on pleasure.

01:07.833 --> 01:09.458
- She'd love you then.
- Pleasure?

01:09.542 --> 01:12.083
- 'Vir?'
- Yes, madam.

01:13.708 --> 01:15.500
(male #1)
'Look, I told you
back on the transport'

01:15.583 --> 01:16.958
watch where the hell
you're going.

01:17.042 --> 01:19.125
I'm tired of you constantly..

01:20.542 --> 01:24.333
Jeez, I'm sorry.
What was I saying?

01:24.417 --> 01:26.583
Absolutely nothing.

01:26.667 --> 01:28.292
Right.

01:28.375 --> 01:30.208
Right.

01:32.833 --> 01:35.917
[instrumental music]

01:46.292 --> 01:48.792
- His name was Stoner?
- Yeah.

01:50.083 --> 01:52.375
Ah, it doesn't ring a bell.

01:52.458 --> 01:54.083
The customs official
who passed him through

01:54.167 --> 01:56.625
recognized him immediately
from my description.

01:56.708 --> 01:58.833
So I ran a check on him through
channels. Nothing extraordinary.

01:58.917 --> 02:00.667
Freelance navigator,
part-time trader.

02:00.750 --> 02:02.250
I mean, there's hundreds,
thousands of guys

02:02.333 --> 02:03.458
like him around.

02:03.542 --> 02:05.708
So what's the problem?

02:05.792 --> 02:08.542
I don't know.
That's the problem.

02:10.125 --> 02:12.542
See, so much of what I do,
it's gut instinct.

02:12.625 --> 02:15.042
I see things, little things,
don't even notice they're there

02:15.125 --> 02:16.833
but they put me on guard.

02:16.917 --> 02:19.792
I just hate not knowing why.

02:19.875 --> 02:22.875
- You wanted to see me, captain?
- Oh, yes, Miss Winters.

02:22.958 --> 02:24.583
Uh, by the way, captain,
for sometime now

02:24.667 --> 02:26.750
I've been meaning to mention
that I think you've settled

02:26.833 --> 02:28.542
nicely into your new duties.

02:28.625 --> 02:30.208
Well, thank you, Miss Winters.

02:30.292 --> 02:33.083
Only a few bumps
along the way so far.

02:33.167 --> 02:34.542
Then again, the day is young.

02:34.625 --> 02:36.625
So how can I be of service?

02:36.708 --> 02:38.708
There's some rumors floating
from the Psi-Corps net.

02:38.792 --> 02:42.000
I was hoping
you could confirm or deny.

02:42.083 --> 02:43.875
Uh, Garibaldi, we'll discuss

02:43.958 --> 02:46.208
this Stoner fellow later,
alright?

02:46.292 --> 02:48.417
Stoner?

02:48.500 --> 02:49.708
Matt Stoner?

02:49.792 --> 02:52.875
Yeah, yeah,
that was his name, Matthew.

02:52.958 --> 02:55.333
He's not here on Babylon 5?

02:55.417 --> 02:57.292
Is that a problem?

02:57.375 --> 03:00.458
- Oh.
- You know him?

03:00.542 --> 03:03.708
Only in the most
unpleasant sense.

03:03.792 --> 03:06.125
I was married to him.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.833
(male narrator)
The Babylon project
was our last

03:11.917 --> 03:14.583
best hope for peace.

03:14.667 --> 03:17.333
A self-contained world
5 miles long

03:17.417 --> 03:19.875
located in neutral territory.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.083
A place of commerce
and diplomacy

03:25.167 --> 03:28.750
for a quarter of a million
humans and aliens.

03:28.833 --> 03:31.917
A shining beacon in space

03:32.000 --> 03:34.083
all alone in the night.

03:34.167 --> 03:37.542
It was the dawn
of the third age of mankind.

03:37.625 --> 03:42.042
The year the great war
came upon us all.

03:42.125 --> 03:45.958
This is the story of the last
of the Babylon stations.

03:46.042 --> 03:48.208
The year is 2259.

03:48.292 --> 03:51.792
The name of the place
is Babylon 5.

03:51.875 --> 03:54.917
[theme music]

04:44.625 --> 04:46.958
(Londo)
'And then he said,
"That's not my leg.'

04:47.042 --> 04:48.500
'That's my air hose."'

04:48.583 --> 04:51.000
[laughing]

04:51.083 --> 04:54.208
Barkeep, another round
for all my friends.

04:54.292 --> 04:56.542
[cheering]

04:57.625 --> 04:59.083
He'll be here shortly,
I swear.

04:59.167 --> 05:01.833
He's probably at a meeting
or something.

05:01.917 --> 05:03.208
He drags me out here

05:03.292 --> 05:05.542
gives no reason
why he wants to see me.

05:05.625 --> 05:08.583
What's he hiding, Vir?
Tell me.

05:08.667 --> 05:11.208
I won't bite, Vir.

05:11.292 --> 05:13.000
With all due respect, madam

05:13.083 --> 05:16.708
that's not what I've heard.

05:16.792 --> 05:20.125
Alright, that one time.

05:20.208 --> 05:22.083
It was, it was twice.

05:22.167 --> 05:25.083
What has he told you about me?
Anything good?

05:25.167 --> 05:27.500
What is there to tell?

05:27.583 --> 05:29.083
Daggair.

05:29.167 --> 05:32.125
My, what a surprise.

05:32.208 --> 05:34.708
- A pleasant one.
- I wouldn't go that far.

05:34.792 --> 05:36.792
Madame Daggair, my pardons.

05:36.875 --> 05:39.750
This is unconscionable.
I-I was at customs.

05:39.833 --> 05:41.333
I don't know
how I could have missed you.

05:41.417 --> 05:44.042
Believe me, Vir,
if you knew her as I do

05:44.125 --> 05:45.875
you wouldn't miss her a bit.

05:45.958 --> 05:48.833
[chuckles]
Oh, Timov, Timov.

05:48.917 --> 05:50.417
Why do you always try to draw me

05:50.500 --> 05:55.125
into your little
verbal fencing matches?

05:55.208 --> 05:59.917
Because I don't have
a real sword handy.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.750
(male announcer)
Attention,
the Earth History Exhibition

06:02.833 --> 06:05.417
will be closing at 1700 hours.

06:08.083 --> 06:09.583
[strums]

06:15.333 --> 06:18.042
You left my office
in quite a hurry.

06:18.125 --> 06:20.708
We didn't have much
of a chance to talk.

06:21.917 --> 06:25.208
- I was not in the mood.
- Hmm, I gathered that.

06:25.292 --> 06:26.708
[chuckles]

06:26.792 --> 06:28.167
Are you now?

06:29.542 --> 06:33.125
Look, captain, I know
you're in charge of this station

06:33.208 --> 06:36.542
but to be blunt,
this isn't your concern.

06:36.625 --> 06:38.833
No, you, you're right,
Miss Winters.

06:38.917 --> 06:42.000
As station commander,
this isn't my concern.

06:43.417 --> 06:46.042
But as one person
who sees another in pain

06:46.125 --> 06:48.833
someone whom he considers
a friend

06:48.917 --> 06:51.875
or at the very least an ally

06:51.958 --> 06:55.833
'I just want you to know that,
uh, I'm willing to listen.'

07:00.667 --> 07:01.875
[beeps]

07:01.958 --> 07:03.417
(Delenn)
'Yes, what?'

07:03.500 --> 07:05.667
Ambassador Delenn,
you asked to see me?

07:05.750 --> 07:07.917
'Are you alone?'

07:08.000 --> 07:10.500
- Yes.
- 'Come in, quickly.'

07:15.833 --> 07:17.167
[grunts]

07:17.250 --> 07:19.542
Commander,
I want you to understand

07:19.625 --> 07:21.500
I acquired
human characteristics

07:21.583 --> 07:24.000
to bring your people
and mine closer together.

07:24.083 --> 07:26.375
'To symbolize our mutuality.'

07:26.458 --> 07:29.458
It is supposed to be
a dignified inspiring transition

07:29.542 --> 07:31.208
for both humans and Minbari.

07:31.292 --> 07:34.542
So will you, please, explain
to me why this-this-this..

07:34.625 --> 07:37.792
- Hair.
- ...refuses to cooperate?

07:40.625 --> 07:43.958
[sighs]
I had no problems
with it at first

07:44.042 --> 07:46.333
but as time passed, it--

07:46.417 --> 07:48.625
It's pretty brittle.

07:48.708 --> 07:50.167
What are you washing it with?

07:50.250 --> 07:51.667
Washing?

07:53.208 --> 07:56.125
Yes, you know, when you bathe.

07:56.208 --> 07:58.792
We use a chemical compound
that strips away

07:58.875 --> 08:01.250
the outer layer
of the epidermal tissue.

08:01.333 --> 08:04.042
It is symbolic
of being reborn each day.

08:04.125 --> 08:06.125
And you've been using this
on your hair?

08:06.208 --> 08:08.125
Yes.

08:08.208 --> 08:09.917
Have you considered
just immersing your body

08:10.000 --> 08:12.083
in water
to remove the sweat and--

08:12.167 --> 08:16.125
We do not perspire
in the same way you do.

08:16.208 --> 08:18.708
While we sleep,
we secrete a fluid--

08:18.792 --> 08:22.042
Ambassador...maybe I should get
somebody else to deal with this.

08:22.125 --> 08:25.042
Do you know what to do?

08:25.125 --> 08:27.250
Well, yes, I mean..

08:27.333 --> 08:29.583
My mother used to do my hair.
But I'm sure--

08:29.667 --> 08:31.750
This is most embarrassing.

08:31.833 --> 08:34.750
- If you could just--
- I have duties.

08:34.833 --> 08:36.958
Please.

08:37.042 --> 08:38.458
I trust you.

08:38.542 --> 08:39.708
[sighs]

08:41.792 --> 08:43.500
- C&amp;C, this is Ivanova.
- 'Online.'

08:43.583 --> 08:47.083
Please inform the captain,
barring an emergency..

08:47.167 --> 08:49.292
...I may be a while.

08:52.792 --> 08:54.708
Oh, boy.

08:54.792 --> 08:57.250
In your first year of training
in Psi-Corps Academy

08:57.333 --> 08:59.083
you're assigned
to an advanced trainee

08:59.167 --> 09:01.167
who oversees your development.

09:01.250 --> 09:02.792
Matt was mine.

09:02.875 --> 09:05.958
He was charming, sympathetic.

09:06.042 --> 09:08.208
Understand me, captain,
the things I learned to do

09:08.292 --> 09:12.500
for Psi-Corps
were and are very difficult.

09:12.583 --> 09:15.833
Matt made the transition easier
at first.

09:15.917 --> 09:19.625
Then the Corps decided that
we were genetically compatible.

09:19.708 --> 09:21.625
The odds of us
producing a child of equal

09:21.708 --> 09:26.125
or greater telepathic abilities
were substantial.

09:26.208 --> 09:28.542
It all happened so fast.

09:31.042 --> 09:32.875
How long were you married?

09:32.958 --> 09:35.625
Just long enough to realize
it was a mistake.

09:37.667 --> 09:41.958
Psi-Corps isn't exactly
forthcoming with its membership

09:42.042 --> 09:44.333
but what information
I did turn up indicated

09:44.417 --> 09:46.708
that Stoner wasn't Corps.

09:46.792 --> 09:48.167
He left.

09:48.250 --> 09:51.458
Shortly afterward, Psi-Corps
had the marriage annulled.

09:51.542 --> 09:54.042
I thought the only way
anyone left Psi-Corps

09:54.125 --> 09:55.542
was feet first.

09:55.625 --> 09:59.208
[chuckles]
Matt had connections.

09:59.292 --> 10:00.667
He had..

10:02.167 --> 10:04.333
I don't know what he had.

10:04.417 --> 10:07.208
No one in authority
wanted to talk about it.

10:17.042 --> 10:18.833
(G'Kar)
'So now that you've been here
for a while'

10:18.917 --> 10:21.792
do you feel
you've settled in, captain?

10:21.875 --> 10:23.583
Why does everyone
keep asking me that?

10:23.667 --> 10:25.917
Oh, merely polite interest.

10:26.042 --> 10:28.458
Ah, I'm sorry, I..

10:28.542 --> 10:30.292
I guess
I'm reading too much into it

10:30.375 --> 10:32.792
but people seem to be implying

10:32.875 --> 10:35.125
that I shouldn't get
too comfortable.

10:35.208 --> 10:36.750
Oh, nonsense. It's not as if

10:36.833 --> 10:39.167
anyone expects you
to, oh, vanish overnight

10:39.250 --> 10:42.458
under mysterious circumstances
to a strange Minbari post.

10:42.542 --> 10:45.292
Why, that would be unprecedented
in this station's history.

10:45.375 --> 10:47.208
- I get the message, ambassador.
- Do you?

10:47.292 --> 10:50.333
I still don't understand
what that was all about.

10:50.417 --> 10:52.958
Something's going on
if you ask me.

10:53.042 --> 10:56.083
[inhales]
Whenever these bizarre
and odd things occur

10:56.167 --> 10:58.417
it gives me pain right here.

10:58.500 --> 11:02.417
Ah, my good Captain Sheridan.

11:02.500 --> 11:05.958
- All settled in?
- All settled, ambassador.

11:06.042 --> 11:08.208
[chuckles]

11:08.292 --> 11:12.167
And my dear G'Kar,
how are you this glorious day?

11:12.250 --> 11:14.000
We're in a space station,
ambassador.

11:14.083 --> 11:15.458
One day is much like another.

11:15.542 --> 11:17.250
That, my friend, is very much

11:17.333 --> 11:18.792
subject to point of view.

11:18.875 --> 11:23.458
And from my point of view,
this is a most glorious day.

11:27.833 --> 11:29.917
G'Kar, you are looking

11:30.000 --> 11:33.042
in particularly
excellent health today.

11:33.125 --> 11:36.042
Whatever it is you're doing,
keep it up.

11:40.750 --> 11:43.042
[sighs]
Excuse me.

11:43.125 --> 11:44.417
Yeah.

11:47.333 --> 11:49.083
- Can I get you anything?
- Yes.

11:49.167 --> 11:50.875
You can get me out of here.

11:50.958 --> 11:54.333
Who does Londo think he is
to keep us sitting about?

11:54.417 --> 11:56.625
He probably thinks
he's our husband

11:56.708 --> 11:59.458
and that we as dutiful wives
will wait

11:59.542 --> 12:02.792
with breathless anticipation
for his arrival.

12:02.875 --> 12:04.292
Is that not right, Vir?

12:04.375 --> 12:05.792
Well, um, actually, it's--

12:05.875 --> 12:08.667
You are joking, Daggair.

12:08.750 --> 12:13.458
Your problem, Timov, is that
you've never known your place.

12:13.542 --> 12:14.917
My place?

12:15.000 --> 12:17.667
You once threatened
to break a vase over his head.

12:17.750 --> 12:21.458
[laughs]
Well, that, that was
the impetuousness of youth.

12:21.542 --> 12:23.625
That was last month.

12:23.708 --> 12:26.208
Daggair,
what are you playing at?

12:26.292 --> 12:30.542
Well, well, well.

12:30.625 --> 12:32.917
And here you are.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.958
And here you are finally.
Where have you been?

12:36.042 --> 12:38.167
Affairs of state, my dear.

12:38.250 --> 12:41.000
State of inebriation, I'd wager.

12:41.083 --> 12:45.375
Londo, you're looking fit.

12:45.458 --> 12:47.625
More handsome
than I would have remembered.

12:47.708 --> 12:49.417
Oh, well.

12:49.500 --> 12:52.375
What's going on here?

12:52.458 --> 12:53.792
Londo, what's all this about?

12:53.875 --> 12:56.583
You have no idea
why I've summoned you all here?

12:56.667 --> 12:58.333
No, and I think
it's about time--

12:58.417 --> 13:01.458
Wait. Where's Mariel?

13:01.542 --> 13:04.125
- Vir?
- I don't know.

13:04.208 --> 13:06.917
I-I was expecting her
and-and-and she didn't show up--

13:07.000 --> 13:09.167
Probably we should wait
for Mariel to arrive--

13:09.250 --> 13:11.958
No, I will not tolerate this
any longer.

13:12.042 --> 13:14.667
The secret
of our marriage's success, Londo

13:14.750 --> 13:16.583
is our lack of communication.

13:16.667 --> 13:18.500
You have jeopardized
that success

13:18.583 --> 13:19.833
and I would know why.

13:19.917 --> 13:23.208
Very well.
I wanted to save the surprise

13:23.292 --> 13:26.042
but clearly you have forgotten

13:26.125 --> 13:28.708
that tomorrow
is the 30th anniversary

13:28.792 --> 13:30.500
of my ascension day.

13:30.583 --> 13:32.375
- It is?
- It is?

13:32.458 --> 13:34.792
Yes.
The emperor has not forgotten.

13:34.875 --> 13:37.250
I personally received
a congratulatory note

13:37.333 --> 13:38.500
from the royal court.

13:38.583 --> 13:40.583
My star is rising

13:40.667 --> 13:42.292
in case you are unaware.

13:42.375 --> 13:44.708
I was unaware, yes.

13:44.792 --> 13:47.208
I have little patience
for the vagaries

13:47.292 --> 13:50.542
of politics and social climbing.

13:50.625 --> 13:54.833
That's always been more
Daggair's field of endeavor.

13:54.917 --> 13:57.167
'Hasn't it, Daggair?'

13:57.250 --> 14:01.583
[laughs]
Now the emperor
is a busy fellow, of course.

14:01.667 --> 14:04.792
No time to shop
unlike my beloved wives

14:04.875 --> 14:08.583
who always find the time
to run up my credit accounts.

14:08.667 --> 14:09.917
[laughing]

14:10.000 --> 14:12.875
In any event,
he wished to give me a gift

14:12.958 --> 14:15.583
in honor of my service
to our people.

14:15.667 --> 14:17.917
And the gift he gave me was

14:18.000 --> 14:21.417
any one wish
within his power to grant.

14:21.500 --> 14:24.583
And what was your wish,
my sweet?

14:24.667 --> 14:26.542
A divorce!

14:26.625 --> 14:27.500
[gasps]

14:27.583 --> 14:28.750
An easement

14:28.833 --> 14:30.083
'from the arranged marriages'

14:30.167 --> 14:31.792
to my three wives.

14:31.875 --> 14:34.042
[chuckles]
However..

14:35.500 --> 14:39.292
...the emperor requested
that I keep one of you

14:39.375 --> 14:42.458
to be by my side
for future state affairs.

14:42.542 --> 14:45.583
So by tomorrow, I will choose

14:45.667 --> 14:48.125
one of the three of you
to remain my wife.

14:48.208 --> 14:51.208
The other two will be gone.

14:51.292 --> 14:53.417
[laughs]

14:55.458 --> 14:56.500
Gone!

14:56.583 --> 14:58.500
You'll receive no further money

14:58.583 --> 15:00.875
beyond the vast amounts
of my savings

15:00.958 --> 15:03.292
you've already diverted
to other accounts.

15:03.375 --> 15:04.625
You'll have no title

15:04.708 --> 15:07.458
and you'll have to do
without the privileges

15:07.542 --> 15:10.042
'to which
you have become accustomed.'

15:10.125 --> 15:14.625
A small repayment
for the many years of joy

15:14.708 --> 15:15.875
'you have given me.'

15:15.958 --> 15:17.792
[chuckles]

15:20.542 --> 15:23.000
You knew about this. You knew!

15:23.083 --> 15:25.333
[chuckles]
Oh, my dear, I've been caught

15:25.417 --> 15:27.500
completely unawares,
I assure you.

15:27.583 --> 15:29.333
- Hmm.
- Petulant, isn't she?

15:29.417 --> 15:31.500
Oh, well, breeding will tell.

15:31.583 --> 15:34.125
A bitch like you
would know about breeding.

15:34.208 --> 15:38.292
Oh, ladies, ladies, please.

15:38.375 --> 15:40.125
Continue.

15:40.208 --> 15:43.000
[doorbell beeps]
Vir, if you wouldn't mind.

15:44.458 --> 15:45.833
Yes.

15:47.667 --> 15:49.167
Enter.

15:51.417 --> 15:53.750
Hello, Londo. Miss me?

16:02.125 --> 16:04.667
[dramatic music]

16:08.125 --> 16:10.750
So tell me
what you think it's worth.

16:14.375 --> 16:16.375
Opening offer or final bid?

16:16.458 --> 16:20.208
Are you here for trade
or simply to waste my time?

16:29.208 --> 16:32.125
'I've seen a number
of Centauri artifacts..'

16:33.583 --> 16:35.875
...but nothing like this.

16:39.125 --> 16:40.625
Care to tell me how you got it?

16:40.708 --> 16:43.917
After all, I wouldn't wanna
think someone in Babylon 5

16:44.000 --> 16:46.042
was dealing in stolen goods.

16:47.500 --> 16:50.333
- And you are?
- Garibaldi, head of security.

16:50.417 --> 16:52.125
Oh, so if I'm feeling insecure

16:52.208 --> 16:54.708
hugging you
will make me feel better?

17:00.250 --> 17:01.833
Certification
of my participation

17:01.917 --> 17:04.458
in an authorized
archeological dig.

17:04.542 --> 17:07.250
List of contents are there.

17:07.333 --> 17:10.375
You'll find this little item
among them.

17:10.458 --> 17:12.708
It's all quite legitimate,
officer.

17:14.542 --> 17:16.500
I can help you
with the big words

17:16.583 --> 17:18.750
if you're having trouble.

17:23.750 --> 17:26.292
While he's assessing its value

17:26.375 --> 17:29.958
why don't you and I
have a little chat in private?

17:33.542 --> 17:38.167
Ambassador, we've received
an invitation to..

17:38.250 --> 17:40.250
Yes, Lennier?

17:40.333 --> 17:42.542
An invitation to?

17:42.625 --> 17:44.625
A celebration
for Ambassador Mollari.

17:44.708 --> 17:46.792
The 30th anniversary
of his ascension.

17:46.875 --> 17:48.625
That's significant?

17:48.708 --> 17:50.875
For a Centauri, oh, yes.

17:50.958 --> 17:53.167
Lennier, we will accept,
of course.

17:53.250 --> 17:55.708
I will convey that message.

17:56.958 --> 17:58.792
Anything else?

18:00.625 --> 18:02.042
Is that painful?

18:02.125 --> 18:04.125
[chuckles]

18:04.208 --> 18:07.375
Actually, it's oddly relaxing.

18:20.625 --> 18:22.917
You've been fairly busy,
haven't you, Mr. Stoner?

18:24.333 --> 18:27.458
Your records have you
all over the place.

18:27.542 --> 18:31.000
Wouldn't be trying to stay
one step ahead of someone..

18:31.083 --> 18:34.583
...or perhaps
involved in some shady dealings?

18:36.083 --> 18:40.000
Do you treat all new arrivals
to Babylon 5 this way

18:40.083 --> 18:42.792
or is this..

18:42.875 --> 18:44.292
...personal?

18:45.583 --> 18:48.500
Talia Winters
is a friend of mine.

18:48.583 --> 18:49.958
Is she here?

18:50.042 --> 18:51.875
Small galaxy, isn't it?

18:51.958 --> 18:54.042
You're gonna pretend
you didn't know?

18:54.125 --> 18:57.250
- Did she tell you all about me?
- No.

18:57.333 --> 19:00.500
Would you like me to tell you
all about her?

19:00.583 --> 19:02.417
Is that it?

19:02.500 --> 19:04.875
What she likes to hear

19:04.958 --> 19:08.042
where she likes to be touched.

19:08.125 --> 19:09.792
Don't push it.

19:09.875 --> 19:12.208
The little noises she makes.

19:12.292 --> 19:15.708
Does she cry out or sigh softly?

19:15.792 --> 19:18.250
Shut...up.

19:19.583 --> 19:21.500
I thought you wanted me to talk.

19:21.583 --> 19:23.917
Make up your mind, officer.

19:31.750 --> 19:34.208
Any more questions, officer..

19:35.333 --> 19:38.250
...or am I free to go?

19:38.333 --> 19:40.917
If Talia Winters
so much as breathes a word

19:41.000 --> 19:43.333
that you've been harassing her

19:43.417 --> 19:44.917
you'll be spaced so fast

19:45.000 --> 19:47.333
you'll think
you were born in a vacuum.

19:48.917 --> 19:50.292
Hmm.

19:52.500 --> 19:55.125
'I'll be keeping an eye on you.'

19:55.208 --> 19:58.417
Use both eyes. You'll need them.

20:08.250 --> 20:09.500
- Excuse me.
- Hmm?

20:09.583 --> 20:11.125
I seem to have gotten separated

20:11.208 --> 20:12.958
during a tour
my husband was giving.

20:13.042 --> 20:16.125
Oh, you must be one
of Ambassador Mollari's wives.

20:16.208 --> 20:17.667
I'd heard you were here.

20:17.750 --> 20:19.542
I'm Captain John Sheridan.

20:19.625 --> 20:22.125
- And I am--
- Mariel!

20:22.208 --> 20:23.833
There you are.

20:23.917 --> 20:27.625
Making new friends...again?

20:27.708 --> 20:31.000
Captain,
a moment of your time, please.

20:32.667 --> 20:36.500
Still the iron claw
in the velvet glove, Mariel?

20:36.583 --> 20:39.083
Getting your claws
into someone else?

20:39.167 --> 20:43.792
Timov, I love you
even if you do not.

20:43.875 --> 20:45.042
Ha!

20:49.250 --> 20:50.958
Be careful.

20:51.042 --> 20:52.958
I should have warned you.

20:53.042 --> 20:55.125
On Earth,
you have these creatures

20:55.208 --> 20:57.333
insects attracted to flames?

20:57.417 --> 21:00.125
Uh, yes, moths.
Uh, they're drawn to flames

21:00.208 --> 21:02.250
and bright lights
and get burned.

21:02.333 --> 21:05.250
Mariel is drawn to men of power
in that same way

21:05.333 --> 21:08.542
but trust me, she burns them.

21:09.792 --> 21:11.750
We'll talk later.

21:23.417 --> 21:25.958
(Matt)
Hello, puddin'.

21:26.042 --> 21:27.958
Glad to see me?

21:29.792 --> 21:31.708
Not a word for your ex?

21:31.792 --> 21:33.708
Not one syllable?

21:33.792 --> 21:36.292
Why have you come here?

21:36.375 --> 21:39.000
You never were a big believer
in coincidence.

21:41.083 --> 21:43.542
We had something once, Talia.

21:43.625 --> 21:45.375
You had something, not we.

21:45.458 --> 21:47.833
And it's nothing
I want any part of.

21:47.917 --> 21:49.208
Not anymore.

21:49.292 --> 21:50.917
I'll add it
to the list of things

21:51.000 --> 21:53.458
you don't want any part of.

21:53.542 --> 21:55.708
Like Psi-Corps.

21:55.792 --> 21:57.417
'But then I forget.'

21:57.500 --> 22:01.750
Anyone who's telepathic
doesn't have that option.

22:01.833 --> 22:03.667
Except you.

22:05.708 --> 22:08.250
You'd love to find out
how I did it, wouldn't you?

22:08.333 --> 22:10.083
How I got out?

22:11.500 --> 22:12.875
Yes.

22:14.458 --> 22:16.583
Anyone can.

22:16.667 --> 22:19.125
All you have to do is lose
your telepathic abilities.

22:19.208 --> 22:21.833
Oh, that's all.

22:21.917 --> 22:23.500
I did it.

22:25.250 --> 22:26.917
What?

22:27.000 --> 22:29.208
They have no hold on me.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.833
I could arrange for them
to have no hold on you either.

22:35.500 --> 22:39.000
You'd be out of Psi-Corps,
Talia.

22:39.083 --> 22:41.167
You'd be free..

22:42.958 --> 22:45.250
...and we could be together.

22:55.875 --> 22:58.208
Talia.
I spoke to your ex-husband.

22:58.292 --> 23:00.417
I, uh, warned him off you.
If he bothers you at all--

23:00.500 --> 23:02.125
Please, keep out of this.

23:02.208 --> 23:04.250
It's not your concern.

23:04.333 --> 23:06.792
- I-I feel it is.
- Feel differently.

23:15.208 --> 23:16.833
[doorbell beeps]

23:21.000 --> 23:22.625
Enter.

23:25.708 --> 23:27.458
- Oh.
- Londo.

23:27.542 --> 23:29.000
I'm not like the others.

23:29.083 --> 23:30.625
- You know that.
- Yes.

23:30.708 --> 23:34.125
I've always been givin',
passionate.

23:34.208 --> 23:37.125
Goodness knows
I've been passionate.

23:37.208 --> 23:40.000
No one can compare to you.

23:40.083 --> 23:42.000
And how many opportunities

23:42.083 --> 23:44.792
have you taken
for comparison, hmm?

23:44.875 --> 23:47.000
There's been no one but you,
I swear.

23:47.083 --> 23:51.250
And I think you'll find out
there's no one for you

23:51.333 --> 23:53.333
but me.

23:53.417 --> 23:56.625
Let's let Londo decide that
for himself.

23:58.708 --> 24:00.417
Both of us..

24:00.500 --> 24:02.125
[chuckles]
...together?

24:02.208 --> 24:05.958
If it pleases Londo,
it pleases me.

24:07.583 --> 24:08.958
No.

24:09.042 --> 24:12.292
No, this isn't right.

24:12.375 --> 24:15.083
Timov should be here too.

24:15.167 --> 24:16.833
Do you seriously expect me

24:16.917 --> 24:20.917
to become involved
in your sexual Olympics?

24:21.000 --> 24:24.792
They're merely expressing
their feelings for me.

24:24.875 --> 24:26.708
I can do that.

24:30.375 --> 24:33.208
- You haven't changed.
- You have.

24:33.292 --> 24:35.292
You've devolved.

24:54.083 --> 24:56.333
Uh, Miss Winters.

24:56.417 --> 24:57.625
Can I help you?

24:57.708 --> 25:01.625
I was rude to you yesterday
and I thought that..

25:01.708 --> 25:03.542
Well, I'm sorry.

25:03.625 --> 25:06.042
Ah, it's okay. No problem.

25:07.292 --> 25:08.792
I wanted everything
settled between us

25:08.875 --> 25:11.375
since it's likely
I'll be leaving Babylon 5.

25:12.917 --> 25:15.458
Uh, reassignment?

25:15.542 --> 25:18.250
Actually, I'll be leaving
with Matt most likely.

25:24.500 --> 25:26.417
Why?

25:26.500 --> 25:29.125
Apparently, the Corps began
experimenting on telepaths

25:29.208 --> 25:31.250
back when we were
still at the academy.

25:31.333 --> 25:32.625
'Matt volunteered.'

25:32.708 --> 25:34.375
'But instead of strengthening
his abilities'

25:34.458 --> 25:36.958
the drug scrambled
his neural pathways

25:37.042 --> 25:38.542
and almost killed him.

25:38.625 --> 25:41.333
When he woke up, he found
he could no longer read minds.

25:41.417 --> 25:43.083
He says he can replicate
the treatment.

25:43.167 --> 25:46.083
- If he could do that for me--
- Come on. Are-are you crazy?

25:46.167 --> 25:48.833
- Talia--
- No, Michael. I'm-I'm tired.

25:48.917 --> 25:52.083
I'm tired of-of learning things
about people I don't wanna know.

25:52.167 --> 25:54.042
I'm tired of having them
shrink away from me

25:54.125 --> 25:55.875
because of what
I might find out.

25:55.958 --> 25:58.125
And I'm tired of being
a part of an organization

25:58.208 --> 26:00.542
that scares the hell out of me.

26:13.333 --> 26:15.542
How can I help you?

26:19.667 --> 26:21.375
And also be aware
that the Markabs

26:21.458 --> 26:23.208
have their day
of high fasting today.

26:23.292 --> 26:25.167
Unfortunately, they tend
to try and sneak food

26:25.250 --> 26:26.875
when the other Markabs
aren't looking.

26:26.958 --> 26:28.500
'Which can lead
to the occasional scuffle'

26:28.583 --> 26:30.125
if a priest catches them.

26:30.208 --> 26:33.375
Well, be sure to alert security
to keep a weather eye out.

26:33.458 --> 26:34.708
Already done, sir.

26:34.792 --> 26:37.125
And lastly, the party
honoring Ambassador Mollari's

26:37.208 --> 26:38.917
day of ascension is tonight.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.208
All attendees must be barefoot.

26:41.292 --> 26:44.208
- Barefoot?
- Barefoot.

26:44.292 --> 26:46.667
[instrumental music]

26:46.750 --> 26:49.208
[indistinct chatter]

26:53.917 --> 26:55.667
Dar G'Kar!

26:55.750 --> 26:58.833
Ambassador G'Kar.

26:58.917 --> 27:01.083
Wearing shoes, Ambassador G'Kar?

27:01.167 --> 27:04.958
You are aware of the level
of insult that represents.

27:05.042 --> 27:06.417
Indeed.

27:06.500 --> 27:07.875
Do you take offense,
ambassador?

27:07.958 --> 27:09.750
Oh, no, not at all.

27:09.833 --> 27:14.250
Nothing is too good
for my esteemed Narn colleague.

27:17.042 --> 27:18.250
Oh.

27:18.333 --> 27:20.917
Oh, I love doing that to him.

27:24.875 --> 27:27.042
Ambassador, you look lovely.

27:27.125 --> 27:29.833
Thank you, Mr. Garibaldi.

27:29.917 --> 27:33.458
And you look...distressed,
actually.

27:34.625 --> 27:37.750
In our language,
seh'lick sakar.

27:37.833 --> 27:39.500
Soul sick.

27:41.917 --> 27:43.208
You know, it's funny.

27:43.292 --> 27:44.458
I met this woman

27:44.542 --> 27:46.458
and I took to her immediately.

27:46.542 --> 27:47.792
Then I met this guy
who had hurt her

27:47.875 --> 27:50.417
and instantly I hated him.

27:50.500 --> 27:53.792
We Minbari believe,
as do some humans

27:53.875 --> 27:56.125
that souls travel together.

27:56.208 --> 27:59.667
Some groups of souls are drawn
onto the other in life

27:59.750 --> 28:02.542
to relive good relationships
from the past.

28:02.625 --> 28:06.000
And if possible
to make right the bad ones.

28:06.083 --> 28:07.708
You're saying
that these other people and I

28:07.792 --> 28:09.958
run into each other
lifetime after lifetime

28:10.042 --> 28:13.583
because our souls have some sort
of cosmic sewing circle going?

28:13.667 --> 28:16.583
Commander Ivanova.
Thank you, commander.

28:17.792 --> 28:19.125
Now, what..

28:19.208 --> 28:20.625
[rattles]

28:20.708 --> 28:23.750
What is this?

28:23.833 --> 28:25.667
[chuckles]

28:25.750 --> 28:27.667
A deck of cards

28:27.750 --> 28:30.125
from my dear friend Lennier.

28:30.208 --> 28:32.417
And I marked them
exactly as you requested.

28:32.500 --> 28:34.125
Keep your voice down.

28:35.708 --> 28:37.125
And..

28:39.083 --> 28:41.000
[all exclaiming]

28:41.083 --> 28:44.250
- Now what is this?
- It's from me.

28:44.333 --> 28:47.083
In a way, it's from all of us.

28:49.583 --> 28:50.542
[rizz]

28:50.625 --> 28:52.083
Ah!

28:52.167 --> 28:55.125
[people gasping]

28:55.208 --> 28:56.375
[Mollari groans]

28:56.458 --> 28:57.708
Medlab, this is Sheridan.

28:57.792 --> 28:59.583
I need an emergency team fast.

28:59.667 --> 29:01.083
(female #1)
'Right away, captain.'

29:10.167 --> 29:13.917
His metabolism
is accelerating exponentially.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.042
Brain waves
are all over the place.

29:16.125 --> 29:17.917
Can you create an antitoxin?

29:18.000 --> 29:20.583
Well, not before
he literally burns himself out.

29:20.667 --> 29:22.125
Transfusion might do it

29:22.208 --> 29:23.958
but we don't have enough
of his type at the blood bank

29:24.042 --> 29:26.708
and we've never been any good
synthesizing Centauri blood.

29:28.042 --> 29:29.417
Alright, I'll check in
with Garibaldi.

29:29.500 --> 29:31.375
See if he's learned anything
else about that artifact.

29:31.458 --> 29:34.042
If his condition changes,
let me know.

29:34.125 --> 29:35.708
Of course.

29:37.750 --> 29:39.333
I didn't know.
I swear I didn't--

29:39.417 --> 29:42.708
Oh, be quiet.
I'm sick of your whining.

29:42.792 --> 29:44.208
[sighs]

29:52.333 --> 29:54.208
You do realize
that he's not made

29:54.292 --> 29:57.542
his divorce decree official yet.

29:57.625 --> 30:00.333
If he dies..

30:00.417 --> 30:02.875
...our futures are secure.

30:02.958 --> 30:06.042
You can face him in his bed
or his deathbed

30:06.125 --> 30:08.208
with equal calm.

30:08.292 --> 30:10.583
I am what I was made..

30:10.667 --> 30:13.875
...by my father, by Londo

30:13.958 --> 30:15.125
by society.

30:15.208 --> 30:17.417
Breeding will tell.

30:17.500 --> 30:19.583
I didn't know it was dangerous.

30:19.667 --> 30:21.958
I've handled it a hundred times.

30:22.042 --> 30:24.125
Centauri metabolism
must set it off.

30:24.208 --> 30:26.208
Well, you can explain it
to the magistrate.

30:26.292 --> 30:28.708
[scoffs]
I'll explain it in hell.

30:30.958 --> 30:32.333
What's up, captain?

30:34.083 --> 30:35.875
I just came from Medlab.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.917
His condition's
tearing him apart.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.958
You must know something
about this artifact.

30:41.042 --> 30:44.375
[scoffs]
I just helped dig it up
and dust it off.

30:44.458 --> 30:46.958
I don't plan on forming a
long-term relationship with it.

30:47.042 --> 30:49.292
You dug it up where?

30:49.375 --> 30:53.458
An abandoned Centauri colony
in Sector 127.

30:53.542 --> 30:55.083
Brilliant.

30:55.167 --> 30:57.750
Did it occur to you to ask
why the Centauri abandoned

30:57.833 --> 30:59.708
that sector in the first place?

30:59.792 --> 31:01.750
'It's because they were
driven out by the Narns.'

31:01.833 --> 31:03.083
(Garibaldi)
'Narns fight dirty.'

31:03.167 --> 31:04.500
They probably rigged
all kinds of traps

31:04.583 --> 31:06.500
and this was probably
one of them.

31:06.583 --> 31:09.083
Mm. Could be.

31:09.167 --> 31:11.833
Which means, I didn't ask
nearly enough money for it.

31:11.917 --> 31:14.208
Oh, well, easy come, easy go.

31:16.500 --> 31:19.167
- Can I go now?
- No.

31:19.250 --> 31:20.708
I'm gonna check with G'Kar
to see if he knows anything

31:20.792 --> 31:23.083
about this, and if by any chance
Londo doesn't survive

31:23.167 --> 31:25.292
you can be sure I'll find
something to charge you with.

31:25.375 --> 31:27.750
Negligence,
transporting dangerous material.

31:27.833 --> 31:29.833
Sure. Why not? Go for broke.

31:29.917 --> 31:33.167
Hey, how about I call you
an idiot in public

31:33.250 --> 31:35.917
and you can convict me
for revealing state secrets?

31:50.208 --> 31:53.125
[sighs]
Remarkably unconcerned,
wouldn't you say?

31:53.208 --> 31:55.208
Yeah, nobody's that cool
under pressure

31:55.292 --> 31:58.292
unless they got an ace
up their sleeve.

31:58.375 --> 32:00.417
Find out what it is, Michael.

32:00.500 --> 32:02.958
Then see what you can do
about Londo.

32:03.042 --> 32:05.583
[dramatic music]

32:09.792 --> 32:11.750
[gadget beeping]

32:20.750 --> 32:21.792
Dr. Franklin?

32:21.875 --> 32:23.500
- Yes.
- About Londo.

32:23.583 --> 32:26.292
Well, I'm afraid there's been
no change in his condition.

32:26.375 --> 32:28.167
I know.

32:28.250 --> 32:29.875
It may interest you to know that

32:29.958 --> 32:32.667
Londo and I
do have one thing in common.

32:32.750 --> 32:33.958
The same blood type.

32:34.042 --> 32:36.667
Well, why didn't you
tell me this before?

32:36.750 --> 32:38.750
I was deciding
what to do about it.

32:38.833 --> 32:41.875
[scoffs]
Well, he's dying.

32:41.958 --> 32:46.000
We all die, doctor,
sooner or later.

32:46.083 --> 32:48.333
As for Londo

32:48.417 --> 32:50.500
'after everything he's done,
I would take'

32:50.583 --> 32:53.250
'some small pleasure
in letting him die.'

32:54.625 --> 32:56.708
But whatever
you may think of me, doctor

32:56.792 --> 33:00.542
I have some principles
that even 20 years with Londo

33:00.625 --> 33:01.833
can't erase.

33:01.917 --> 33:04.875
I do not like to win
my battles this way.

33:04.958 --> 33:08.708
I find it
vaguely unsatisfying.

33:08.792 --> 33:11.417
'So you may have
your transfusion, doctor'

33:11.500 --> 33:13.375
on one condition.

33:13.458 --> 33:16.750
He must never know I did this.

33:16.833 --> 33:18.583
I don't think
either of us could stand

33:18.667 --> 33:22.042
the awkwardness
of false gratitude.

33:22.125 --> 33:25.208
I can live with that. This way.

33:25.292 --> 33:28.208
Chief, got the information
you wanted on Stoner.

33:28.292 --> 33:30.292
- Good news?
- Bad.

33:30.375 --> 33:32.250
Corroborates everything
he told us.

33:32.333 --> 33:35.083
Archaeological dig, getting
booted out of Psi-Corps--

33:35.167 --> 33:37.167
No, no, no, no. I don't buy it.

33:37.250 --> 33:40.042
Nobody leaves Psi-Corps.

33:40.125 --> 33:42.208
I wanna talk to him again.

33:42.292 --> 33:45.250
Okay. I'll tell him.
As soon as he finishes eating.

33:45.333 --> 33:49.125
Eating? Prisoners don't get
dinner for another hour.

33:49.208 --> 33:50.292
Yeah, that's right.

33:50.375 --> 33:53.042
So how did he get a meal now?

33:53.125 --> 33:56.708
Well...he just asked for it.

33:57.958 --> 33:59.208
I don't know.

33:59.292 --> 34:00.583
You know, there's something
about this guy

34:00.667 --> 34:03.708
that just makes you
wanna like him.

34:11.542 --> 34:12.833
You okay?

34:15.667 --> 34:18.250
Londo, do you know
where you are?

34:18.333 --> 34:22.500
Either in Medlab or in hell.

34:22.583 --> 34:25.917
Either way,
the decor needs work.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.042
Oh, Dr. Franklin

34:28.125 --> 34:31.042
thank you
for saving our husband.

34:31.125 --> 34:34.708
You've done the Centauri
a great service.

34:34.792 --> 34:36.167
I agree.

34:36.250 --> 34:39.042
It's so good to see you
with us again, Londo.

34:40.583 --> 34:43.375
Well, that settles it, doctor.
I am in hell.

34:45.625 --> 34:49.583
And what?
Not a word from you, Timov?

34:49.667 --> 34:53.333
'Not an insincere word
of relief?'

34:53.417 --> 34:58.583
Not a blink of forced concern
for my well-being?

34:58.667 --> 35:00.250
No.

35:00.333 --> 35:02.750
If you'll excuse me,
I'll be in my quarters.

35:02.833 --> 35:07.500
I'm suddenly feeling
quite fatigued.

35:07.583 --> 35:10.083
Yes, I think I will do the same.

35:18.000 --> 35:21.167
Ugh. Nightmares, all of them.

35:22.875 --> 35:24.667
And Timov..

35:24.750 --> 35:27.000
...the worst of the lot.

35:27.083 --> 35:28.333
Ambassador Mollari, do you mind

35:28.417 --> 35:30.458
if I make
one personal observation?

35:30.542 --> 35:32.875
No, not at all.

35:32.958 --> 35:34.833
Stick it.

35:40.250 --> 35:42.292
How odd.

35:42.375 --> 35:45.042
I didn't even know
we were married.

35:47.667 --> 35:49.375
[sighs]

35:51.208 --> 35:52.542
I can't believe
you're throwing away

35:52.625 --> 35:54.208
your chance to leave Psi-Corps.

35:54.292 --> 35:56.125
I am what I am, Matt.

35:56.208 --> 35:58.958
I don't wanna carve out
a piece of myself.

35:59.042 --> 36:01.292
I just wanted you
to come with me.

36:03.625 --> 36:05.875
I didn't want to pressure you.

36:05.958 --> 36:09.125
I want it to be different
this time.

36:09.208 --> 36:11.000
'I was certain that
if I told you about the cure'

36:11.083 --> 36:13.583
'you'd wanna come
of your own free will.'

36:13.667 --> 36:17.792
I can't walk away from who I am
or what I am.

36:17.875 --> 36:20.750
If you take away my talents

36:20.833 --> 36:23.250
I don't know what would be left.

36:23.333 --> 36:25.833
'You can understand that,
can't you?'

36:28.042 --> 36:29.542
I suppose so.

36:30.875 --> 36:32.583
'But you're still coming
with me, Talia.'

36:32.667 --> 36:34.958
Matt, I don't want..

36:37.792 --> 36:40.750
You're coming with me.

36:40.833 --> 36:42.500
Of course.

36:46.500 --> 36:48.792
You'll arrange
for immediate transport.

36:48.875 --> 36:51.542
It will be waiting for you
in Docking Bay 9.

37:01.042 --> 37:02.708
(Garibaldi)
Hey.

37:06.417 --> 37:09.458
Thanks, Talia, for your help.

37:09.542 --> 37:12.125
Damn, I love being right.

37:12.208 --> 37:14.375
You know, the problem
with mysteries is that

37:14.458 --> 37:16.125
in order to get rid
of the headaches

37:16.208 --> 37:18.667
I have to figure them out.

37:18.750 --> 37:21.000
Here, we're faced
with a staggering set

37:21.083 --> 37:22.375
of coincidences.

37:22.458 --> 37:23.542
A Centauri artifact

37:23.625 --> 37:25.583
an ancient booby trap it seems

37:25.667 --> 37:27.708
happens to show up on Babylon 5

37:27.792 --> 37:31.125
just in time to be purchased
as a gift for Londo.

37:31.208 --> 37:34.167
And rather than hide
or deny responsibility

37:34.250 --> 37:38.000
the gift-giver makes a point
of saying she gave it to him.

37:38.083 --> 37:40.208
Which neatly avoids
any accusation

37:40.292 --> 37:42.375
of malicious intent
because usually

37:42.458 --> 37:44.333
when you're trying
to kill someone

37:44.417 --> 37:46.250
you hide the attempt.

37:46.333 --> 37:47.875
[chuckles]

37:47.958 --> 37:51.375
And there you see,
my head no longer throbs.

37:51.458 --> 37:54.000
That's a very
interesting theory, G'Kar.

37:54.083 --> 37:55.208
To whom will you tell it?

37:55.292 --> 37:57.792
Oh, do I look
like a rumormonger?

38:00.792 --> 38:02.500
Do not underestimate him.

38:02.583 --> 38:04.875
If I could figure it out,
so could he.

38:04.958 --> 38:09.042
- G'Kar, a pleasure as always.
- Hmm.

38:11.250 --> 38:14.750
I warn you, Mariel,
do not be overconfident.

38:14.833 --> 38:16.833
If I were married
to Londo Mollari

38:16.917 --> 38:18.333
I'd be concerned.

38:18.417 --> 38:21.375
G'Kar, if you were married
to Londo Mollari

38:21.458 --> 38:23.375
we'd all be concerned.

38:26.792 --> 38:28.292
Phew.

38:28.375 --> 38:29.750
[chuckles]

38:40.333 --> 38:43.875
Well, quite a piece of work,
Mr. Stoner.

38:43.958 --> 38:48.375
Our initial inquiries said that
you and Psi-Corps are quits.

38:48.458 --> 38:50.042
'Yet we slap you
in a holding cell'

38:50.125 --> 38:51.250
'prepare to charge you'

38:51.333 --> 38:53.000
'with transporting
a dangerous object

38:53.083 --> 38:56.583
not to mention
your escape attempt.

38:56.667 --> 38:58.917
Suddenly,
Psi-Corps rides to the rescue

38:59.000 --> 39:00.792
'ordering that
you be turned over to them'

39:00.875 --> 39:02.500
'on the first
available shuttle.'

39:02.583 --> 39:05.042
I left their employ
under cordial circumstances.

39:05.125 --> 39:08.583
I don't think
you left their employ at all.

39:08.667 --> 39:11.833
You told Talia that
the experiments performed on you

39:11.917 --> 39:15.958
by the Corps
erased your telepathic ability.

39:16.042 --> 39:19.125
'I think they transformed it.'

39:19.208 --> 39:22.292
Turned you into something new.

39:22.375 --> 39:23.708
An empath.

39:25.958 --> 39:28.750
'Your effect
on Garibaldi and Talia'

39:28.833 --> 39:31.542
and Officer Welch
all point to it.

39:31.625 --> 39:33.625
See, Psi-Corps couldn't keep you
on the regular rolls

39:33.708 --> 39:36.208
because the rest would find out
about you pretty fast.

39:36.292 --> 39:38.625
'The last thing the Corps wants
is for folks to find out'

39:38.708 --> 39:40.208
'they've been experimenting
on telepaths'

39:40.292 --> 39:42.083
'to increase their abilities.'

39:42.167 --> 39:44.542
So they let you go officially

39:44.625 --> 39:47.167
but kept you on unofficially.

39:47.250 --> 39:48.917
[chuckles]

39:49.000 --> 39:50.917
This is nonsense.

39:51.000 --> 39:52.375
(Garibaldi)
'Is it?'

39:52.458 --> 39:55.125
Before you changed,
the Corps decided

39:55.208 --> 39:57.625
you and Talia were genetically
a perfect couple.

39:57.708 --> 39:59.292
So it makes sense
they'd send you here

39:59.375 --> 40:00.833
in the hope
of breeding more empaths

40:00.917 --> 40:03.625
even if it meant
controlling her to do it.

40:03.708 --> 40:06.292
I think you should just forget
about all of this.

40:06.375 --> 40:09.625
Oh, I wouldn't try that little
trick again if I were you.

40:09.708 --> 40:12.542
See, I've got five armed guards
outside watching the monitors

40:12.625 --> 40:15.875
and if we start acting
like best buddies..

40:15.958 --> 40:18.500
...their orders
are to come in shooting.

40:18.583 --> 40:20.000
Tough guy.

40:22.208 --> 40:25.667
'You've surrounded yourself
with tough guys.'

40:25.750 --> 40:30.500
Talia, I was only trying to act
in your best interests.

40:30.583 --> 40:33.250
Not repeat the mistakes
of the past.

40:33.333 --> 40:35.542
'I wasn't lying to you.'

40:35.625 --> 40:38.333
I do know the cure.

40:38.417 --> 40:41.250
Look into my mind.

40:41.333 --> 40:44.208
No shields, no tricks.

40:46.750 --> 40:48.208
No chance.

40:54.250 --> 40:56.750
See you in some other lifetime.

41:01.125 --> 41:05.542
(male announcer)
'The Centauri Liner Vellurian
is now in its final boarding.'

41:05.625 --> 41:07.958
This is the ambassador's
upcoming itinerary.

41:08.042 --> 41:10.417
I've marked those events
which you might wish to attend

41:10.500 --> 41:13.667
and those where he will
actually be accompanying you.

41:15.000 --> 41:18.750
Ladies, it's been a pleasure
meeting you.

41:20.583 --> 41:23.917
Londo,
you're making a big mistake.

41:24.000 --> 41:26.875
- A huge mistake.
- Well, it won't be my first.

41:26.958 --> 41:28.917
Actually, it will be my fourth.

41:29.000 --> 41:31.250
Look, be satisfied
I decided to give you

41:31.333 --> 41:33.750
a reasonable allowance
as settlement.

41:33.833 --> 41:35.667
Are we supposed to be
grateful for that?

41:35.750 --> 41:38.708
Yes, you are.
That's the joy of it.

41:38.792 --> 41:40.292
Goodbye, ladies.

41:42.750 --> 41:44.625
Alright, Londo.

41:44.708 --> 41:47.708
Why did you choose to keep me
as your wife and not them?

41:47.792 --> 41:50.417
I've made no pretense
of affection for you.

41:50.500 --> 41:53.083
I find your recent actions
contemptible.

41:53.167 --> 41:56.375
I'll never love you.
At best, I'll tolerate you.

41:56.458 --> 41:58.917
And I'll never be
what you want me to be.

41:59.000 --> 42:00.417
Why me?

42:00.500 --> 42:04.417
Because with you, I will
always know where I stand.

42:16.792 --> 42:19.833
(female announcer)
'Centauri Liner Vellurian,
you are cleared for jump.'

42:26.667 --> 42:28.458
Commander.

42:28.542 --> 42:29.917
Susan.

42:30.000 --> 42:31.125
I wish to thank you again

42:31.208 --> 42:32.958
for your patience
and understanding.

42:33.042 --> 42:34.250
Oh, not a problem.

42:34.333 --> 42:35.958
Taking on human characteristics

42:36.042 --> 42:38.417
has been something
of an education for both of us.

42:38.500 --> 42:40.792
[chuckles]
Well, if you have
any other problems

42:40.875 --> 42:44.167
any other questions at all,
just ask.

42:44.250 --> 42:47.875
Well, uh,
now that you mention it

42:47.958 --> 42:49.750
do you have any idea

42:49.833 --> 42:53.208
why I suddenly
started getting these..

42:53.292 --> 42:55.125
...odd cramps?

43:07.042 --> 43:09.542
[theme music]
