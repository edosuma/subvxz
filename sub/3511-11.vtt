00:07.251 --> 00:10.093
Regina, your new album, "Fatal
Impact," drops next week.

00:10.094 --> 00:11.529
What can you tell us about it?

00:11.530 --> 00:14.886
It's about love, heartbreak, and revenge.

00:14.887 --> 00:15.884
It's my best album yet.

00:15.885 --> 00:18.127
Oh, my God. It's Josie Lang.

00:18.549 --> 00:21.881
Josie! Here!

00:26.999 --> 00:29.190
What the hell is Josie Lang
doing at my release party?

00:29.191 --> 00:30.698
Her album's out next week, too.

00:30.699 --> 00:32.946
Having both of you here
gets us more press.

00:32.947 --> 00:35.378
More press for who, me or her?

00:35.379 --> 00:37.508
Regina. Thank you for the invite.

00:37.509 --> 00:39.562
You know, you're the
reason I'm a pop star.

00:39.563 --> 00:43.011
I've been a huge fan ever
since I was in grade school.

00:45.000 --> 00:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:10.298 --> 01:13.881
That is ridiculous. I do not lose a turn.

01:13.882 --> 01:15.315
Are you kidding? No, that's the rules.

01:15.316 --> 01:16.528
You absolutely lose your turn.

01:16.529 --> 01:17.757
Ask him. 'Sito.

01:17.758 --> 01:18.981
Ask me what?

01:19.020 --> 01:21.471
In a relationship, if you choose a movie

01:21.472 --> 01:23.492
and you choose very, very poorly,

01:23.493 --> 01:24.508
do you lose your turn?

01:24.509 --> 01:25.315
How poorly?

01:25.316 --> 01:26.220
"Valentine's Day."

01:26.221 --> 01:28.180
- You should lose two turns.
- What?

01:28.181 --> 01:29.988
- Yeah. I'm just saying.
- Those are the rules.

01:29.989 --> 01:31.494
- Those are the rules.
- That's ridiculous.

01:31.495 --> 01:34.084
So the body was found in
this dumpster over here

01:34.085 --> 01:35.906
by a homeless dude who
was looking for cans.

01:35.907 --> 01:37.724
It was wrapped up in this tarp.

01:38.754 --> 01:39.366
'Cause?

01:39.367 --> 01:40.508
G.S.W.

01:40.509 --> 01:43.352
As near as I could tell,
she was shot at close range.

01:43.353 --> 01:44.574
Minimal blood seepage

01:44.575 --> 01:46.809
and lack of spatter in the area suggests

01:46.810 --> 01:49.097
she was killed elsewhere,
then dumped here.

01:49.098 --> 01:50.980
So someone was hoping she'd catch a ride

01:50.981 --> 01:53.596
with the morning haul,
disappear under some landfill.

01:53.597 --> 01:54.791
Any idea who she is?

01:54.792 --> 01:57.094
Well, according to her I.D.,
her name is Holly Rhodes.

01:57.095 --> 01:59.751
But her business card has
her listed as D.J. Beat.

01:59.752 --> 02:01.394
Called the number, and
her booking agent says that

02:01.395 --> 02:04.412
she was deejaying an album
launch party in Soho last night

02:04.413 --> 02:05.833
for pop star Regina Cane.

02:05.834 --> 02:06.945
What?

02:07.085 --> 02:08.851
Aw, dude. You remember that music video

02:08.852 --> 02:10.860
where she was dressed up
as a sexy little girl scout?

02:10.862 --> 02:12.255
I don't care what those cookies cost.

02:12.256 --> 02:13.572
I would sell my left...

02:13.573 --> 02:16.243
Anyway, she was booked at
the party till 1:00 A.M.

02:16.244 --> 02:17.578
- 1:00 A.M.?
- Yeah, why?

02:17.579 --> 02:20.045
We're placing the time of death
between 11:00 and midnight.

02:20.046 --> 02:22.678
So whatever happened
happened at that party.

02:23.512 --> 02:24.991
This ink looks fresh.

02:24.992 --> 02:25.976
It's an unlisted number.

02:25.977 --> 02:27.378
I got a call in to the phone company.

02:27.379 --> 02:28.743
All right, you guys set up a canvass

02:28.744 --> 02:29.891
for anyone that saw the body dump.

02:29.892 --> 02:31.435
Castle and I will head down to Soho,

02:31.436 --> 02:32.924
see what happened last night.

02:37.896 --> 02:39.123
Good morning.

02:40.085 --> 02:41.025
Killer party.

02:41.026 --> 02:42.441
Well, it looks like Regina went all out

02:42.442 --> 02:44.141
to promote her new album.

02:44.803 --> 02:46.370
I remember when Alexis used to play

02:46.371 --> 02:49.482
her big hit "Call Me
Crazy" over and over again.

02:49.483 --> 02:50.868
Drove me crazy.

02:50.869 --> 02:52.750
Of course, it was no "Valentine's Day."

02:54.947 --> 02:57.434
Excuse me, NYPD. Where's the host?

02:57.435 --> 02:59.561
Forget the host. Where's your pants?

02:59.919 --> 03:00.846
Am I right?

03:00.847 --> 03:02.424
Nah. I've been there. Check by the pool.

03:02.425 --> 03:05.550
Wait. You're N.Y. what now?

03:05.551 --> 03:06.218
P.D.

03:06.219 --> 03:07.811
As in, a detective.

03:07.812 --> 03:09.833
We're here about Holly Rhodes.

03:10.270 --> 03:11.596
Who is Holly Rhodes?

03:11.597 --> 03:12.726
D.J. Beat.

03:12.727 --> 03:14.215
She was your deejay for your party.

03:14.216 --> 03:16.564
Oh, that skank.

03:16.565 --> 03:19.444
Yeah, bitch almost ruined my entire party.

03:19.991 --> 03:22.379
When I left to get
ready for my performance,

03:22.380 --> 03:24.507
she was supposed to stay
and get the crowd pumped.

03:24.508 --> 03:28.365
Instead, the music
stopped, and she was gone.

03:28.584 --> 03:30.877
She didn't even come
back to get her equipment.

03:30.878 --> 03:33.037
So you're saying that she left early?

03:33.850 --> 03:34.184
Yeah.

03:34.185 --> 03:37.750
Around 11:00, after jacking in a playlist.

03:37.751 --> 03:40.360
I didn't pay for a playlist.

03:40.361 --> 03:42.614
If you see her, tell
her I want my money back.

03:42.615 --> 03:44.086
That might be a little tough,

03:44.087 --> 03:45.385
seeing as she's dead.

03:45.386 --> 03:47.646
She was killed just
after leaving your party.

03:47.647 --> 03:50.357
Great. Now I feel bad for complaining.

03:50.358 --> 03:52.198
Did you notice any unusual behavior?

03:52.199 --> 03:54.508
Was she having problems with
any of your other guests?

03:54.509 --> 03:58.173
No. But then again, I
was busy making my rounds.

03:58.174 --> 03:59.124
Right. Okay.

03:59.125 --> 04:00.114
Well, I'll need a guest list

04:00.115 --> 04:02.821
along with the names of everyone
that was working last night.

04:02.822 --> 04:04.162
No problem.

04:04.163 --> 04:06.803
I'll have my publicist send it right over.

04:11.137 --> 04:13.540
So I spoke with several
of the other party guests,

04:13.541 --> 04:15.360
and they confirm Regina's story.

04:15.361 --> 04:17.386
Apparently, Holly just suddenly left.

04:17.387 --> 04:18.760
In the middle of her set, why?

04:18.761 --> 04:20.999
Well, we answer that, we'll
find out why she was killed.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.067
Anyone see where she went?

04:22.067 --> 04:23.443
No, and there's no security cameras.

04:23.444 --> 04:24.466
I'm seeing if I can pull tape

04:24.467 --> 04:25.772
from businesses across the street.

04:25.773 --> 04:26.864
Did you get ahold of next of kin?

04:26.865 --> 04:29.620
Nah. She doesn't have any.
Holly was an only child.

04:29.621 --> 04:32.226
Bounced around foster
care till she was 18.

04:32.227 --> 04:33.671
That can't have been an easy childhood.

04:33.672 --> 04:35.130
Probably why her hobbies as a teenager

04:35.131 --> 04:37.707
include burglary and shoplifting.

04:37.708 --> 04:39.505
Then she graduated to grand theft.

04:39.506 --> 04:40.723
Anything more recent?

04:40.724 --> 04:42.100
Not in the last seven years.

04:42.101 --> 04:43.128
She must have cleaned up her act

04:43.129 --> 04:44.601
when she got serious about being a deejay.

04:44.602 --> 04:45.640
Oh, and hey, get this.

04:45.641 --> 04:47.970
The uniforms canvassing
Holly's apartment building

04:47.971 --> 04:50.625
found a neighbor who saw a
man pounding on Holly's door

04:50.626 --> 04:51.430
a few days ago.

04:51.431 --> 04:52.228
What was it about?

04:52.229 --> 04:54.765
The neighbor heard him scream,
"you won't get away with this."

04:54.766 --> 04:56.787
Either Holly wasn't home or
she wouldn't answer the door,

04:56.788 --> 04:58.171
and eventually, the guy took off.

04:58.172 --> 05:00.146
Neighbor is with a
sketch artist as we speak.

05:00.147 --> 05:01.285
Okay.

05:01.286 --> 05:03.350
Yo. I got a hit on that phone
number written on Holly's hand.

05:03.351 --> 05:04.988
It belongs to a Tyrese Wilton.

05:04.989 --> 05:07.102
Apparently he's some
big-time record producer.

05:08.190 --> 05:09.658
He's on the guest list.
He was at the party.

05:09.659 --> 05:10.751
You guys see what he knows.

05:10.752 --> 05:13.011
Castle, Lanie knows where
our victim was killed.

05:13.012 --> 05:15.568
I noticed it when I was cutting
her out of her clothes...

05:15.569 --> 05:17.280
stains on her outfit.

05:17.725 --> 05:19.744
The lab identified it as peanut oil

05:19.745 --> 05:21.924
with high concentrations of M.S.G.

05:21.925 --> 05:24.103
Meaning what, she was eating Chinese food

05:24.104 --> 05:25.136
and spilled some on herself?

05:25.137 --> 05:26.383
Except

05:26.384 --> 05:28.195
I checked her stomach contents.

05:28.196 --> 05:29.063
No Chinese.

05:29.064 --> 05:31.051
And they weren't serving
any at the party either.

05:31.052 --> 05:32.401
So I checked with C.S.U.

05:32.402 --> 05:34.642
They said there was no
trace of it in the dumpster,

05:34.643 --> 05:36.586
but it's all over the tarp, meaning...

05:36.587 --> 05:39.344
She may have been killed at
or near a Chinese restaurant.

05:39.345 --> 05:43.544
Narrowing it down to every
single block in Manhattan.

05:46.288 --> 05:47.902
Uh, what about the gun?

05:47.903 --> 05:49.408
Slug is from a .380,

05:49.409 --> 05:51.723
but there were no ballistic
hits in the system.

05:51.724 --> 05:54.945
Oh, and when C.S.U. processed
the tarp and the clothes,

05:54.946 --> 05:58.849
they also found these... synthetic fibers.

05:58.850 --> 06:01.073
They didn't come from the dumpster either.

06:01.270 --> 06:03.158
But the lab is still running tests.

06:03.159 --> 06:04.320
I'll keep you posted.

06:04.321 --> 06:06.138
If Tyrese is so big-time,

06:06.139 --> 06:08.716
why is the entrance to
his studio in an alley?

06:08.806 --> 06:10.646
Because celebrities don't want paparazzi

06:10.647 --> 06:11.855
taking their picture all the time.

06:11.856 --> 06:14.138
Yo, did you just do the hair thing?

06:14.139 --> 06:15.395
What hair thing?

06:15.396 --> 06:16.290
Every time you're about to meet

06:16.291 --> 06:17.647
a celebrity or a pretty girl,

06:17.648 --> 06:19.143
you run your hand through your hair.

06:19.144 --> 06:22.315
T.M.Z. said that Tyrese was
at that party with Josie Lang.

06:22.316 --> 06:23.836
He's producing her new album.

06:23.837 --> 06:25.301
Yeah, well, she's no Regina.

06:25.302 --> 06:27.118
I understand that the
image of her as a girl scout

06:27.119 --> 06:28.534
is seared into your memory,

06:28.535 --> 06:29.835
but Josie is a real vocalist.

06:29.836 --> 06:32.507
Whose fan base consists
of 12-year-old girls...

06:32.508 --> 06:33.684
and you.

06:34.500 --> 06:35.367
Stand by.

06:35.368 --> 06:37.868
Hey, Ty, you want me to take
that from the second bar?

06:38.538 --> 06:40.448
Sorry, Jo. We gotta take 15.

06:40.625 --> 06:42.395
Hey, since Josie was at the party,

06:42.396 --> 06:43.666
I should probably take
her statement, right?

06:43.667 --> 06:45.119
You got this, right, bro? Thanks.

06:46.299 --> 06:47.869
Sorry. This is such a crazy thing.

06:47.870 --> 06:49.611
I can't believe she's dead.

06:50.154 --> 06:51.593
How well did you know Holly, Tyrese?

06:51.594 --> 06:53.306
I met her for the first time at the party.

06:53.307 --> 06:54.245
I was there with Josie

06:54.246 --> 06:56.004
'cause we've been working on her album,

06:56.005 --> 06:58.344
and I used to produce
Regina back in the day.

06:58.345 --> 06:59.746
Can you tell me why we
found your phone number

06:59.747 --> 07:02.370
- written on the victim's hand?
- What, that?

07:02.513 --> 07:04.470
- Mm-hmm.
- I gave her my digits so we could set up a meeting.

07:04.471 --> 07:05.260
About what?

07:05.261 --> 07:07.425
If there's one thing I'm
good at, it's spotting talent.

07:07.426 --> 07:09.238
Her mashups and beat match went better

07:09.239 --> 07:10.936
than most of the guys
dropping albums today.

07:10.937 --> 07:11.846
I was blown away.

07:11.847 --> 07:13.663
I told her I wanted to
take her to the next level.

07:13.664 --> 07:14.757
So how'd she react to that?

07:14.758 --> 07:15.497
She was thrilled.

07:15.498 --> 07:17.596
Said a break like this is
what she'd been working for.

07:17.597 --> 07:19.141
She was supposed to call me today.

07:19.142 --> 07:21.281
You have any idea why she
rushed out of that party early?

07:21.282 --> 07:24.435
Nah. Coulda had something to
do with that fight, though.

07:24.485 --> 07:25.100
What fight?

07:25.101 --> 07:26.162
You heard of M.C. Thug?

07:26.163 --> 07:27.742
M.C. Thug? Yeah, the rapper.

07:27.743 --> 07:29.813
- Been shot like seven times, right?
- That's the one.

07:29.814 --> 07:31.984
Now on Holly's first break,
he walked over to her booth,

07:31.985 --> 07:33.766
starts talking to her real low and angry.

07:33.767 --> 07:35.243
I could see she was getting upset,

07:35.244 --> 07:36.226
tried to push him away.

07:36.227 --> 07:37.771
Then he grabbed her wrist and said,

07:37.772 --> 07:40.645
"next time, it's gonna end different."

07:40.762 --> 07:42.503
Then he saw me coming and bounced.

07:42.504 --> 07:43.650
Now I was gonna talk to her about it,

07:43.651 --> 07:46.372
but, you know, I got
caught up with some folks,

07:46.373 --> 07:48.443
the next thing I knew, she was gone.

07:48.444 --> 07:50.806
This M.C. Thug, did you
see him at the party anymore

07:50.807 --> 07:51.597
after Holly left?

07:51.598 --> 07:54.352
Nah. In fact, I didn't see
him the rest of the night.

07:55.318 --> 07:57.430
So if you can just make
it out to Jenny and Kev.

07:57.431 --> 07:58.576
It's short for Kevin.

07:58.577 --> 08:01.483
Hey, fanboy. Let's go.

08:01.484 --> 08:02.698
Thank you so much.

08:02.699 --> 08:04.138
She's gonna die when she sees this.

08:04.139 --> 08:05.717
Thank you. Nice to meet you.

08:07.198 --> 08:08.320
M.C. Thug...

08:08.321 --> 08:10.054
aka Darius Carson.

08:10.055 --> 08:11.246
His rap sheet includes

08:11.247 --> 08:13.566
assault with a deadly
weapon and attempted murder,

08:13.567 --> 08:16.405
and that was just at this
year's hip-hop music awards.

08:16.406 --> 08:19.272
How did Holly wind up in the
sights of a guy like that?

08:19.273 --> 08:20.761
Well, whatever was going on between them

08:20.762 --> 08:22.539
happened way before that party.

08:22.540 --> 08:23.969
The guy who was pounding on Holly's door,

08:23.970 --> 08:24.729
threatening her?

08:24.730 --> 08:26.925
The sketch just came in from the neighbor.

08:28.867 --> 08:30.506
Look familiar?

08:43.019 --> 08:44.270
Darius Carson...

08:44.270 --> 08:47.640
Nobody calls me Darius unless you my mama,

08:47.641 --> 08:49.868
and by the looks of that body, you ain't.

08:49.869 --> 08:52.575
Yeah, well, I'm sure your mama's so proud.

08:52.576 --> 08:53.345
Yeah.

08:53.346 --> 08:55.095
So, Darius,

08:55.096 --> 08:57.206
according to Regina Cane's party planner,

08:57.207 --> 08:59.028
you weren't on the original guest list

08:59.029 --> 09:00.529
until you made a last-minute phone call

09:00.530 --> 09:01.676
to get in the party.

09:01.677 --> 09:03.729
I'm a fan of her music. That a crime?

09:03.730 --> 09:05.418
No, but murder is.

09:05.419 --> 09:06.516
I know you ain't a cop

09:06.517 --> 09:08.331
with that fancy shirt and poufy hair.

09:08.332 --> 09:10.882
He might not be, but I am.

09:11.330 --> 09:13.655
Are you sure you went to
the party to see Regina?

09:13.656 --> 09:15.507
Yeah, I'm real sure.

09:15.508 --> 09:17.157
Why?

09:18.395 --> 09:21.192
We know that you visited D.J.
Beat's apartment before the party.

09:21.193 --> 09:22.908
We know that you fought
with her that night,

09:22.909 --> 09:24.553
and then she turned up dead.

09:24.554 --> 09:25.816
I had nothing to do with that mess.

09:25.817 --> 09:27.054
Yeah, but you had
something to do with her.

09:27.055 --> 09:29.493
Damn straight. I wanted
my girl's bracelet back.

09:29.494 --> 09:30.735
Who had your girl's bracelet?

09:30.736 --> 09:32.250
I threw a party at my crib last week.

09:32.251 --> 09:33.964
I hired D.J. Beat to spin.

09:33.965 --> 09:38.024
The next day, my girl Dakota realized
her diamond bracelet is missing.

09:38.025 --> 09:40.090
Now that bitch and her
little bitch of an assistant

09:40.091 --> 09:42.248
are the only ones there
I couldn't vouch for.

09:43.149 --> 09:44.338
The bitch had an assistant bitch?

09:44.339 --> 09:46.102
Yeah, the little punk that works for her.

09:46.103 --> 09:48.000
So then you tracked her down to the party.

09:48.001 --> 09:48.874
And when she ran,

09:48.875 --> 09:50.459
you followed her and you killed her.

09:50.460 --> 09:53.764
No, I told her she had a
day to cough it up or else.

09:53.765 --> 09:54.547
Or else what?

09:54.548 --> 09:57.811
"Or else" is usually enough.

09:58.061 --> 10:00.215
Where were you between 11:00 and midnight?

10:00.216 --> 10:02.530
Upstairs... with my girl.

10:02.531 --> 10:03.658
Dakota?

10:03.659 --> 10:06.339
Different girl. Kaiya.

10:07.674 --> 10:09.922
All right. Well, I'm gonna have to
hold you while we look into that.

10:09.923 --> 10:12.487
Good. That helps my street cred.

10:12.684 --> 10:14.047
You guys are gonna do a mug shot, right?

10:14.048 --> 10:16.824
'Cause I brought my lighting guy with me.

10:20.429 --> 10:21.506
Thanks.

10:22.282 --> 10:23.026
Hey, guys.

10:23.027 --> 10:26.405
So Kaiya confirms that she was
"hanging out" with M.C. Thug

10:26.406 --> 10:27.960
in one of the bedrooms till 12:30.

10:27.961 --> 10:30.880
And he did file a police report
about the missing bracelet.

10:30.881 --> 10:33.235
So I requested a list of all the parties

10:33.236 --> 10:34.707
that Holly worked in the past year.

10:34.708 --> 10:36.162
Of the more than 50 events,

10:36.163 --> 10:39.123
turns out that thefts were
reported in seven of them.

10:39.124 --> 10:41.773
M.O. is the same every time...
mostly high-end jewelry.

10:41.774 --> 10:43.978
In total, almost half a million bucks.

10:43.979 --> 10:46.702
All taken from parties
at upscale residences.

10:46.703 --> 10:48.399
And I also confirmed
with Holly's booking agent

10:48.400 --> 10:49.940
that she always worked
with an assistant...

10:49.941 --> 10:50.794
Paul Travers.

10:50.795 --> 10:52.473
Okay, so the two of them are a crew

10:52.474 --> 10:54.774
using her deejay skills
to access high-end homes

10:54.775 --> 10:56.209
and then cleaning them out along the way.

10:56.210 --> 10:57.401
She does have a history of theft,

10:57.402 --> 10:58.701
so maybe she went back to her old ways.

10:58.702 --> 11:00.398
But if the assistant
worked the party with her,

11:00.399 --> 11:03.002
then where is he and why
hasn't he come forward?

11:03.003 --> 11:05.764
There's only one reason. He was involved.

11:06.117 --> 11:07.000
I... involved in what?

11:07.001 --> 11:09.143
My friend is dead, and
now you're saying, what,

11:09.144 --> 11:10.702
like, we're like Bonnie and Clyde?

11:10.703 --> 11:14.389
Paul, thefts were reported at seven
of the parties that you both worked.

11:14.390 --> 11:15.596
Oh, and so because of her history,

11:15.597 --> 11:16.719
it's gotta be her?

11:16.720 --> 11:19.527
Music saved her. She
was done with that life.

11:19.528 --> 11:20.521
And what about you?

11:20.522 --> 11:21.677
According to Holly's agency,

11:21.678 --> 11:23.313
you were responsible for setting up

11:23.314 --> 11:25.250
and breaking down the equipment.

11:25.251 --> 11:27.406
- So?
- So you never broke it down last night.

11:27.407 --> 11:28.887
You left the party, never came back,

11:28.888 --> 11:29.673
same as Holly.

11:29.674 --> 11:31.810
Only you're still alive, and she's dead.

11:31.811 --> 11:32.897
- Last night?

11:34.235 --> 11:35.093
Paul, don't lie.

11:35.094 --> 11:37.166
She's got you listed on her invoice.

11:37.677 --> 11:39.471
Yeah, I... I... I know.

11:39.472 --> 11:42.059
A few times this past year,
she'd call me up last minute

11:42.060 --> 11:43.331
to say she was using another guy.

11:43.332 --> 11:45.881
It was, like, her cousin or
something, and he needed the work.

11:46.200 --> 11:47.540
I... I know she felt bad about it

11:47.541 --> 11:50.119
'cause she still offered to pay me anyway.

11:50.287 --> 11:51.892
I... I was at a birthday
dinner last night.

11:51.893 --> 11:53.678
I have witnesses.

11:53.722 --> 11:57.931
Which of these parties
did the other guy work?

11:57.932 --> 11:58.880
This one.

11:58.881 --> 12:01.503
This one. Here.

12:02.663 --> 12:04.073
This one. This one.

12:04.074 --> 12:06.386
This one, and that one.

12:06.468 --> 12:08.520
The same ones that reported robberies.

12:08.521 --> 12:10.492
So far only one witness, a caterer,

12:10.493 --> 12:14.075
remembers seeing a guy setting
up Holly's equipment last night.

12:14.076 --> 12:15.268
And she only saw him from behind,

12:15.269 --> 12:16.267
and he was wearing a hoodie.

12:16.268 --> 12:18.031
So we've reached out to other party guests

12:18.032 --> 12:19.120
to see if we can get a better description.

12:19.121 --> 12:21.379
So was anything stolen
from the party last night?

12:21.380 --> 12:22.688
No. We asked everyone.

12:22.689 --> 12:24.536
And so far, no one's
reported anything missing.

12:24.537 --> 12:25.348
Yo.

12:25.349 --> 12:27.425
So unis searched Holly's apartment again.

12:27.426 --> 12:28.705
There's no sign of the stolen goods,

12:28.706 --> 12:31.117
and there's no influx
of cash into her account,

12:31.118 --> 12:32.895
so if she was making money off this thing,

12:32.896 --> 12:34.092
there's no evidence of it.

12:35.196 --> 12:38.768
What if this mystery assistant
is the one behind it all?

12:38.769 --> 12:39.817
I mean, think about it.

12:39.818 --> 12:42.317
He forces Holly to get
him into these parties.

12:42.318 --> 12:44.051
While she's busy spinning,

12:44.052 --> 12:46.412
he's free to walk around
these fancy apartments.

12:46.413 --> 12:47.574
And since he's hired help,

12:47.575 --> 12:48.712
nobody pays him any attention.

12:48.713 --> 12:50.040
It's candy from a baby.

12:50.041 --> 12:52.848
But when M.C. Thug confronted
Holly, she got scared.

12:52.849 --> 12:55.216
So she threatened to blow
the whistle on the assistant.

12:55.217 --> 12:57.179
Well, that would certainly
give him motive for murder.

12:57.180 --> 12:58.437
But with Paul's name on the invoice,

12:58.438 --> 12:59.849
there's no record of him.
How are we gonna find him?

12:59.850 --> 13:02.066
He helped set up that
equipment last night, right?

13:02.067 --> 13:03.844
His fingerprints would be on it.

13:05.351 --> 13:06.678
Get C.S.U. on it.

13:11.942 --> 13:13.555
Grunt work. I'll come back later.

13:13.556 --> 13:16.344
- So long as you leave the coffee.
- What did you find?

13:16.627 --> 13:18.251
Holly's phone records.

13:18.922 --> 13:21.849
She received calls from a pay
phone in Washington Heights

13:21.850 --> 13:22.986
the same days that she was booked

13:22.987 --> 13:24.989
for the parties where the thefts happened.

13:24.990 --> 13:27.549
Well, maybe it's her mystery
assistant, calling for details.

13:27.550 --> 13:29.084
Holly grew up in the heights,

13:29.085 --> 13:30.376
so it might be someone
from the old neighborhood,

13:30.377 --> 13:32.771
but it doesn't bring us
any closer to finding him.

13:32.772 --> 13:33.667
Doesn't need to.

13:33.668 --> 13:35.479
C.S.U. matched a print on that equipment

13:35.480 --> 13:39.009
to one Joey Malone...
street name, "Monster."

13:39.010 --> 13:40.947
He's got a list of priors a mile long.

13:40.948 --> 13:42.394
Unis took him down in Washington heights.

13:42.395 --> 13:44.088
He's in the box. Come take a look.

13:44.580 --> 13:45.528
Monster?

13:45.529 --> 13:47.561
Now that sounds like the
kind of ganged-up thug

13:47.562 --> 13:48.569
that would shoot you dead

13:48.570 --> 13:50.264
and leave you in a dumpster someplace.

13:50.265 --> 13:51.959
Probably half man, half mountain,

13:51.960 --> 13:53.364
full of prison tats.

13:53.365 --> 13:56.243
Or is he quietly dangerous?

13:56.244 --> 13:57.565
You know, like, Javier Bardem

13:57.566 --> 13:59.712
in any movie where he's got weird hair.

13:59.713 --> 14:01.607
Just take a look for yourself.

14:02.365 --> 14:03.407
Behold...

14:05.771 --> 14:06.988
Monster.

14:09.679 --> 14:11.227
More like Cookie Monster.

14:18.217 --> 14:19.579
So what do we know about this kid?

14:19.580 --> 14:21.887
Well, he's not related to Holly, for one.

14:21.888 --> 14:24.459
His father died of a drug
overdose when he was 7.

14:24.460 --> 14:27.084
His mom committed suicide
a couple of years ago.

14:27.085 --> 14:28.039
His Uncle... Martin Decker...

14:28.040 --> 14:29.341
is the one who took over guardianship.

14:29.342 --> 14:30.508
Where's his Uncle now?

14:30.509 --> 14:32.868
He's not at home. I
notified social services,

14:32.869 --> 14:34.106
thinking they might know how to reach him.

14:34.107 --> 14:35.517
You said that he had priors.

14:35.518 --> 14:37.272
Yeah, he was busted for
breaking and entering,

14:37.273 --> 14:39.051
burglary, resisting arrest.

14:39.052 --> 14:40.911
Now he's moved up to the big leagues.

14:40.912 --> 14:43.153
So, uh, what's the plan here?

14:43.154 --> 14:45.651
I'm gonna go in alone so
he doesn't feel outnumbered,

14:45.652 --> 14:47.352
see what he's made out of.

14:49.971 --> 14:50.735
He's 14.

14:50.736 --> 14:52.802
It's hard to believe he's
capable of something like this.

14:52.803 --> 14:54.606
Not in his world, it isn't.

14:56.467 --> 14:57.380
Hi, Joey.

14:57.381 --> 14:59.487
I'm Detective Kate Beckett.

14:59.582 --> 15:01.862
A major hottie is what you are.

15:01.863 --> 15:03.432
Okay. Now that we got that cleared up,

15:03.433 --> 15:05.912
I need to ask you a few questions.

15:05.913 --> 15:07.631
You need permission from my guardian.

15:07.632 --> 15:10.307
The last time I checked, I'm a minor.

15:10.308 --> 15:11.830
Well, we're making our best effort

15:11.831 --> 15:12.899
to get ahold of your Uncle.

15:12.900 --> 15:16.671
In the meantime, NYPD policy
allows me to talk to you.

15:16.672 --> 15:17.651
Well, so talk.

15:17.652 --> 15:20.379
We're looking into the
murder of Holly Rhodes.

15:21.195 --> 15:22.396
Heard about that.

15:23.402 --> 15:24.483
Real sad.

15:25.081 --> 15:27.147
I understand that two nights
ago, you worked for her.

15:27.148 --> 15:29.185
Did you see her having
problems with anyone?

15:29.186 --> 15:30.273
No.

15:30.807 --> 15:32.226
Do you know why she left the party early?

15:32.227 --> 15:32.773
Nope.

15:32.774 --> 15:34.300
- Do you know where she went?
- No clue.

15:34.301 --> 15:35.914
Okay, let me ask you this...

15:36.193 --> 15:39.236
why did you think Holly
hired a 14-year-old kid

15:39.237 --> 15:41.758
with a record to be her tech assistant?

15:41.759 --> 15:42.568
'Cause I'm the best.

15:42.569 --> 15:45.094
The best at what, stealing?

15:45.666 --> 15:47.213
Every time you've worked for Holly,

15:47.214 --> 15:49.105
high-end jewelry has gone missing...

15:49.106 --> 15:51.172
every single time.

15:51.173 --> 15:52.668
I don't know nothin' about that.

15:52.669 --> 15:54.073
Did Holly know about the stealing

15:54.074 --> 15:55.312
or did she find out that night?

15:55.313 --> 15:56.668
Is that why you killed her?

15:56.729 --> 15:57.970
What... what? Kill her?

15:57.971 --> 15:59.739
No. No.

15:59.740 --> 16:00.840
I didn't do that.

16:00.841 --> 16:02.484
We have witnesses that saw you

16:02.485 --> 16:04.184
leave the party right after she did.

16:04.185 --> 16:06.081
And you never came back for the equipment.

16:06.082 --> 16:08.265
So where were you between
11:00 and midnight?

16:08.266 --> 16:09.531
I was at... I was at TV King.

16:09.532 --> 16:10.396
You left the party

16:10.397 --> 16:12.037
and the equipment to go to TV King

16:12.038 --> 16:14.115
in the middle of the night?

16:14.116 --> 16:16.595
You're gonna have to do
better than that, Joey.

16:17.082 --> 16:18.846
You may be allowed to talk to me...

16:20.536 --> 16:22.044
but I don't have to talk back.

16:24.956 --> 16:26.963
Robbery and murder?

16:27.323 --> 16:29.370
Maybe Monster wasn't such
a bad nickname after all.

16:29.371 --> 16:31.177
You know what? I'm not sure about that.

16:31.178 --> 16:33.975
He expected the conversation
about the stealing,

16:33.976 --> 16:36.013
but when I accused him of murdering Holly,

16:36.014 --> 16:36.923
that threw him.

16:36.924 --> 16:40.069
And I think I know why.
Joey's alibi checks out.

16:40.070 --> 16:41.676
Seriously, he was at TV King?

16:41.677 --> 16:43.604
The assistant manager sometimes lets him

16:43.605 --> 16:45.228
play video games up on the big screen,

16:45.229 --> 16:48.285
and that's where Joey was
during Holly's time of death.

16:48.286 --> 16:50.388
Well, then if he didn't
kill Holly, then who did?

16:50.389 --> 16:52.658
The brains behind this
operation, that's who.

16:52.659 --> 16:54.602
A kid like Joey goes from smash-and-grabs

16:54.603 --> 16:55.982
to stealing a half a mil in jewelry?

16:55.983 --> 16:56.746
I don't think so.

16:56.747 --> 16:58.239
Someone put him up to this.

16:58.240 --> 17:00.461
No, that makes sense.
Sometimes savvy criminals

17:00.462 --> 17:01.991
use minors to do their dirty work.

17:01.992 --> 17:03.697
Of course.

17:03.866 --> 17:05.819
A Fagin to Joey's Oliver Twist.

17:05.819 --> 17:07.910
And if Holly's involved, that
makes her the artful dodger,

17:07.911 --> 17:08.888
or the artful deejay.

17:08.890 --> 17:10.183
Ooh, nicely played.

17:10.184 --> 17:11.861
And that would explain why we never found

17:11.862 --> 17:14.412
the stolen loot in Holly
or Joey's apartments.

17:14.413 --> 17:15.807
Fagin has it.

17:15.808 --> 17:17.617
That gives him motive to get rid of Holly

17:17.617 --> 17:18.780
if she ever gave him any trouble.

17:18.781 --> 17:20.410
Well, if we're right,

17:20.560 --> 17:22.712
then Joey knows who our killer is.

17:24.164 --> 17:25.361
I get this kid.

17:25.799 --> 17:27.083
Let me get a crack at him.

17:32.435 --> 17:33.895
Hey, where's the super-hot detective?

17:33.896 --> 17:36.226
Oh, you're looking at him. Don't laugh.

17:36.227 --> 17:38.070
I was featured in the NYPD calendar.

17:38.071 --> 17:39.656
I bet that was a big seller.

17:40.006 --> 17:40.895
So, uh,

17:40.896 --> 17:42.163
you must be the good cop.

17:42.164 --> 17:43.682
Well, I don't know about that.

17:43.683 --> 17:46.278
But I could be your ticket out of this.

17:46.279 --> 17:47.677
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

17:47.678 --> 17:48.629
How's that work?

17:48.630 --> 17:50.687
We know you didn't kill Holly.

17:50.759 --> 17:52.541
All you did was lift a bunch of jewelry.

17:52.542 --> 17:53.859
Nah, nah, just save it.

17:53.860 --> 17:55.424
We don't care about the jewelry.

17:55.425 --> 17:57.170
We can take those charges off the table.

17:57.171 --> 17:59.828
All we want is the guy
who put you up to it.

18:00.780 --> 18:02.021
I don't even know who
you're talking about.

18:02.022 --> 18:03.077
Joey, come...

18:03.078 --> 18:05.409
I just gave you the
winning lottery ticket.

18:05.410 --> 18:06.716
Now the right move here

18:06.717 --> 18:08.674
is to cash that in, not tear it up.

18:08.675 --> 18:10.752
I bet this is the part where you tell me,

18:10.753 --> 18:13.400
I don't know the
seriousness of my situation.

18:13.401 --> 18:15.409
How unless I tell you everything I know,

18:15.410 --> 18:16.513
you can't help me.

18:16.514 --> 18:19.321
And then you'll lean in
close, like you care about me

18:19.322 --> 18:20.967
and like you're my friend,

18:21.734 --> 18:23.945
and you'll make promises
you'll never keep.

18:24.939 --> 18:26.778
I keep all my promises, bro.

18:26.779 --> 18:28.420
That's what everybody says.

18:29.378 --> 18:30.873
This is a limited-time offer, Joey.

18:30.874 --> 18:32.376
Not interested.

18:32.599 --> 18:33.578
Okay.

18:35.790 --> 18:37.151
I want you to take a look at this.

18:38.832 --> 18:40.600
This is how Holly ended up...

18:41.088 --> 18:42.052
shot,

18:42.416 --> 18:43.851
tossed in the garbage.

18:45.219 --> 18:47.976
Now you think she deserved that, hmm?

18:48.921 --> 18:50.412
Oh, wh... what?

18:50.925 --> 18:53.206
No smart-ass comeback now, huh?

18:54.384 --> 18:55.581
You worked with this woman.

18:55.582 --> 18:56.643
You knew her.

18:58.501 --> 18:59.269
The same guy

18:59.270 --> 19:01.960
who has you stealing
jewelry did this to Holly.

19:02.096 --> 19:03.860
He uses kids like you.

19:03.934 --> 19:05.746
And then he just gets to walk away

19:05.747 --> 19:08.397
while you have to sit in here
and answer all my questions.

19:08.562 --> 19:10.186
You know what you are to him right now?

19:10.471 --> 19:11.946
You're a loose end.

19:13.533 --> 19:14.834
So take a hard look,

19:15.820 --> 19:17.284
because this is your future.

19:17.937 --> 19:19.113
This is you.

19:21.384 --> 19:22.434
You're wrong.

19:24.263 --> 19:25.335
He won't hurt me.

19:25.949 --> 19:28.055
He won't. Not once we stop him.

19:28.056 --> 19:30.397
All I need is his name, Joey.

19:36.449 --> 19:38.535
I still don't know who
you're talking about.

19:39.645 --> 19:42.577
I've been Joey's caseworker
since his parents died.

19:42.578 --> 19:44.912
Needless to say, it
hasn't been smooth sailing,

19:44.913 --> 19:47.569
but I can't imagine he'd
do anything like this.

19:47.570 --> 19:50.258
Well, we think that the thefts
were someone else's idea.

19:50.259 --> 19:51.430
Do you know of anyone in his life

19:51.431 --> 19:52.838
who might have drawn him into this?

19:52.839 --> 19:55.731
No, but it wouldn't surprise
me if there was someone.

19:55.732 --> 19:58.187
His Uncle's not exactly
a strong role model.

19:58.188 --> 19:59.608
What about his Uncle? Where is he now?

19:59.609 --> 20:00.911
We're trying to track him down.

20:00.912 --> 20:03.611
He may be in A.C. He's a card player.

20:03.612 --> 20:05.156
Guy sounds like a real prize.

20:05.157 --> 20:07.006
You want the best option for these kids.

20:07.007 --> 20:09.989
And sometimes all you have
is the least-bad option.

20:09.990 --> 20:12.583
Which brings me to the issue
of what to do with Joey.

20:12.584 --> 20:14.129
Are you charging him with theft?

20:14.130 --> 20:15.696
We were hoping not to.

20:16.209 --> 20:18.166
So... I'll put him in
temporary foster care.

20:18.167 --> 20:20.494
Whoa, whoa, whoa. He's not safe
out there in the world right now.

20:20.495 --> 20:22.048
The guy that we're after killed a woman.

20:22.049 --> 20:23.193
He could do the same thing to Joey.

20:23.194 --> 20:26.071
Then you can put him in protective
custody in juvenile hall.

20:26.072 --> 20:28.378
I... I can't just throw him in juvie.

20:28.379 --> 20:29.869
I'm trying to gain his trust here.

20:29.870 --> 20:33.338
Ms. Cooper, this boy is the
key to us solving a murder.

20:33.339 --> 20:36.163
Well, I'm sorry, but
those are the choices.

20:40.325 --> 20:41.549
What if I take him?

20:42.508 --> 20:44.914
That way, he's not locked up,

20:44.915 --> 20:46.186
and I can keep him safe.

20:46.187 --> 20:48.307
And I can continue to work on him.

20:49.601 --> 20:50.789
What about that?

20:51.028 --> 20:52.056
I...

20:52.837 --> 20:54.845
I suppose I could delay his paperwork,

20:54.846 --> 20:56.633
but this would be for one night,

20:56.634 --> 20:59.566
and it means that Joey
Malone is your responsibility.

20:59.567 --> 21:01.577
It's cool. I got this.

21:01.859 --> 21:03.007
The kid doesn't have a father.

21:03.008 --> 21:04.888
He probably just needs
someone to connect with.

21:09.955 --> 21:12.453
I'd rather have a pajama
party with the lady cop.

21:12.454 --> 21:14.706
Yeah? Well, it looks like
I drew the short straw,

21:14.920 --> 21:15.916
literally.

21:17.372 --> 21:18.996
Man, no wonder you're single.

21:19.539 --> 21:21.126
No woman would spend time here

21:21.127 --> 21:22.723
unless it was against her will.

21:22.724 --> 21:24.522
Yeah, what about you, Martha Stewart?

21:24.849 --> 21:25.790
What's your place supposed to be,

21:25.791 --> 21:27.830
shabby chic, emphasis on shabby?

21:27.831 --> 21:30.231
It's a dive, but it's not my fault.

21:30.896 --> 21:33.622
My Uncle would rather blow
all of his money at the tables.

21:33.623 --> 21:35.429
Must be why he's too busy to call us back.

21:35.430 --> 21:36.739
Don't wait by the phone.

21:36.884 --> 21:39.228
He only cares about
claiming me as a dependent.

21:39.819 --> 21:41.237
My parents split up when I was 5.

21:41.238 --> 21:43.367
Man, get your feet off my table.

21:45.164 --> 21:47.094
Dad moved to Florida with his new wife.

21:47.205 --> 21:50.039
Most I ever got after that
was a phone call or a postcard.

21:50.330 --> 21:51.820
- Postcard?
- Yeah.

21:51.821 --> 21:53.338
How old are you, anyway?

21:53.339 --> 21:55.449
Ancient, but...

21:55.687 --> 21:57.631
I'm young enough to
remember what it was like.

22:00.941 --> 22:02.314
You must miss your folks.

22:07.088 --> 22:08.653
After my dad died,

22:09.076 --> 22:10.309
my mom kept going.

22:10.938 --> 22:12.085
You know, she tried to pretend

22:12.086 --> 22:13.988
that we were still a normal family.

22:14.360 --> 22:16.223
She did her best to take care of me

22:16.306 --> 22:17.235
until...

22:18.886 --> 22:20.486
she couldn't do it anymore.

22:22.513 --> 22:23.988
Now you take care of yourself.

22:23.993 --> 22:24.859
Yeah.

22:25.351 --> 22:28.445
Look, man, I know you
didn't have to do this.

22:28.868 --> 22:30.374
Take me in, I mean.

22:31.033 --> 22:32.512
So, uh, thanks.

22:35.429 --> 22:36.723
I'm gonna go grab you a blanket,

22:36.724 --> 22:37.655
pillow.

22:38.644 --> 22:39.948
Hey, at least you didn't skimp out

22:39.949 --> 22:41.720
on the audio-visual budget.

22:41.832 --> 22:42.966
You know that's right.

22:43.167 --> 22:45.797
Oh, and I got "Assassin's Creed III."

22:46.077 --> 22:47.802
So go ahead and knock yourself out.

22:47.803 --> 22:50.581
Oh, and, uh, put it on dual-player mode

22:50.582 --> 22:52.130
so I can come back and school you.

22:53.121 --> 22:55.614
Yeah, 20 bucks says you
won't make it past level one.

22:55.615 --> 22:57.518
What? Crazy.

23:16.778 --> 23:17.684
Sit down.

23:20.062 --> 23:21.206
Okay.

23:23.579 --> 23:24.613
Care to explain?

23:24.735 --> 23:26.197
What, the handcuffs?

23:26.198 --> 23:27.956
No, no. The stylish
shoes that you're wearing.

23:27.957 --> 23:29.335
Yes, the handcuffs.

23:29.359 --> 23:31.727
Well, junior here tried to
pull a Houdini on me last night.

23:31.728 --> 23:32.360
Who the hell is Houdini?

23:32.361 --> 23:34.154
- Shut up.
- Out the window?

23:34.155 --> 23:35.016
Yeah.

23:36.107 --> 23:37.113
Down the fire escape?

23:37.114 --> 23:39.605
Yeah, and then on to
a moving garbage truck.

23:39.606 --> 23:41.227
Then on a skateboard for 5 blocks,

23:41.228 --> 23:42.988
which took him all the
way to the "L" train.

23:43.018 --> 23:44.024
How'd you keep up?

23:44.025 --> 23:46.992
- He didn't.
- Shut up. What the... give me that.

23:48.595 --> 23:50.315
I commandeered this dude's bicycle,

23:50.316 --> 23:52.153
and then he lost me in the subway.

23:52.722 --> 23:54.929
But then I caught him at the next stop.

23:55.390 --> 23:56.362
Kid's wily.

23:56.363 --> 23:58.084
But I'm wilier.

23:58.396 --> 24:00.981
Wow. Just like "the French Connection."

24:00.982 --> 24:03.571
In the meantime, C.S.U. was
able to I.D. those fibers

24:03.572 --> 24:05.854
found on the tarp that
Holly's body was wrapped in.

24:05.855 --> 24:07.228
- Where are they from?
- Germany.

24:07.229 --> 24:09.035
Based on the chemical
composition and color,

24:09.036 --> 24:10.280
they're fibers from carpeting

24:10.281 --> 24:12.940
used by a high-end
European car manufacturer

24:12.941 --> 24:14.395
to line their vehicles' trunks.

24:14.396 --> 24:15.928
Mm. Well, now we know how Holly's body

24:15.929 --> 24:17.304
ended up at that construction site.

24:17.305 --> 24:20.696
C.S.U. narrowed it down
to a model 2010 to 2012 X5.

24:20.697 --> 24:22.471
I'll canvass around the construction site,

24:22.472 --> 24:24.255
see if anyone saw a car like that

24:24.256 --> 24:25.496
hanging around the dumpster.

24:25.609 --> 24:29.346
So we pulled Joey's juvie files
from the central clerk's office.

24:29.347 --> 24:30.711
Theory being, whoever he's involved with

24:30.712 --> 24:32.252
might be in there somewhere.

24:32.253 --> 24:33.629
Unless he gave you a name.

24:34.014 --> 24:36.035
Uh, n... no.

24:36.438 --> 24:37.490
Not exactly.

24:38.376 --> 24:40.971
Look, we find out who
Joey got mixed up with,

24:40.972 --> 24:41.991
we find our killer.

24:41.992 --> 24:43.677
There's gotta be something in these files

24:43.678 --> 24:44.792
that points to him.

24:44.793 --> 24:45.878
Looks like he got his first taste

24:45.879 --> 24:47.563
with a B&E when he was 11 years old.

24:47.564 --> 24:49.846
Graduated to burglary when he was 12...

24:49.847 --> 24:52.076
Broke in to a mom-and-pop corner store

24:52.077 --> 24:54.598
along with an identified adult male.

24:54.599 --> 24:55.945
Maybe he's the one we're looking for.

24:55.946 --> 24:58.129
No, we're not looking for
someone who he was busted with.

24:58.130 --> 25:00.081
This guy's smart enough
to stay above it all.

25:02.369 --> 25:03.367
Check this out.

25:03.544 --> 25:05.636
Two months ago, someone
named Shane Winters

25:05.637 --> 25:06.826
bailed him out after he was picked up

25:06.827 --> 25:08.070
on a shoplifting charge.

25:08.302 --> 25:10.667
Shane Winters? I remember that name.

25:13.273 --> 25:15.559
When Holly Rhodes, our victim, was 17,

25:15.560 --> 25:17.399
she was busted on a grand theft charge.

25:17.400 --> 25:20.155
And check out who posted bail.

25:21.325 --> 25:22.592
Shane Winters.

25:23.425 --> 25:24.563
That's our guy.

25:25.268 --> 25:26.839
Shane Winters.

25:27.120 --> 25:28.680
Trafficking, grand theft,

25:28.681 --> 25:30.405
assault with a deadly weapon, extortion...

25:30.406 --> 25:31.487
this dude has dabbled in everything.

25:31.488 --> 25:32.765
So when Holly was a troubled teen,

25:32.766 --> 25:34.762
she must have worked for
Shane, just like Joey is.

25:34.763 --> 25:36.906
But then she cleaned herself
up, got out of the life.

25:36.907 --> 25:37.691
Then when Shane figured out

25:37.692 --> 25:39.435
what kind of access she
had at the parties,

25:39.436 --> 25:40.619
he pulled her back in.

25:40.661 --> 25:41.624
Well, that explains why Holly

25:41.625 --> 25:43.475
had to hire Joey as an assistant.

25:43.476 --> 25:45.662
Just ran Shane Winters.
Guess what he drives.

25:45.663 --> 25:47.020
2010 X5.

25:47.108 --> 25:49.112
That would have the carpet
fibers we found on the tarp.

25:49.113 --> 25:51.626
Yeah, and a roomy trunk for
all your body-moving needs.

25:51.627 --> 25:53.060
- We gotta bring him in.
- We tried to.

25:53.061 --> 25:55.758
Unis busted in on his last-known
address. He's not there.

25:59.653 --> 26:02.013
So what are you, officer babysitter?

26:03.167 --> 26:04.717
Do you get paid extra for doing that?

26:06.890 --> 26:07.997
Where's Shane Winters?

26:08.027 --> 26:09.127
Where's my soda?

26:09.847 --> 26:10.875
L.T.

26:18.091 --> 26:19.851
You figure you're
special to him, don't you?

26:20.349 --> 26:21.308
Well, you're not.

26:21.513 --> 26:22.374
Man...

26:23.094 --> 26:24.302
you don't get it.

26:24.985 --> 26:26.297
I'm not giving him up.

26:27.281 --> 26:28.759
You know how much time
keeping your mouth shut

26:28.760 --> 26:30.149
is gonna buy you with Shane

26:32.134 --> 26:33.244
as long as it takes him to pull his gun

26:33.336 --> 26:34.696
and shoot you with it.

26:34.955 --> 26:36.221
And then he's just gonna move on

26:36.222 --> 26:37.582
to the next lost kid.

26:38.747 --> 26:40.262
Don't let it end that way, Joey.

26:41.221 --> 26:43.026
Just tell me where I can find him.

26:47.127 --> 26:48.393
I'm not a rat.

26:51.587 --> 26:52.437
Any luck?

26:52.438 --> 26:53.514
Man, I just want to wring

26:53.515 --> 26:55.067
this little bastard's neck right now.

26:55.068 --> 26:56.318
I'm gonna call that a no.

26:56.910 --> 27:00.268
So we got a bolo out on Shane and his car.

27:00.525 --> 27:01.649
Freakin' kids, man.

27:01.650 --> 27:02.757
I don't know how you do it, bro.

27:02.758 --> 27:05.457
Oh, no, no. I lucked out with Alexis.

27:05.767 --> 27:07.656
At a certain point, you
realize you're just...

27:07.874 --> 27:10.901
dealing with someone who hasn't
been around as long as we have.

27:10.902 --> 27:12.166
They have to find their way.

27:12.320 --> 27:14.036
The problem is, he's
already found his way.

27:14.037 --> 27:15.475
He just doesn't see
where it's gonna put him.

27:15.476 --> 27:17.109
Hey, no luck on the bolo.

27:17.110 --> 27:18.791
But I talked to Garcia in robbery.

27:19.231 --> 27:20.610
We got a tip on Shane's location.

27:20.611 --> 27:21.661
You want to roll?

27:22.375 --> 27:23.362
You know what?

27:23.535 --> 27:24.806
Let me get this one.

27:32.599 --> 27:33.537
Hey, sugar.

27:33.839 --> 27:35.014
What's your poison?

27:37.760 --> 27:39.038
Hey, guys. How you doing?

27:46.717 --> 27:47.560
Hello.

27:47.561 --> 27:48.875
What are you drinking?

27:49.251 --> 27:51.827
Mr. Winters is not
taking any meetings today.

27:54.304 --> 27:55.762
Can I just get a bag of ice, please?

27:56.205 --> 27:58.064
What the hell do you
want with a bag of ice?

28:01.201 --> 28:02.145
It's for him.

28:03.168 --> 28:04.205
Excuse me.

28:07.761 --> 28:09.633
You must be Detective Esposito.

28:10.207 --> 28:11.866
Joey told me you two been hanging out.

28:11.867 --> 28:14.240
Said sooner or later, you'd
find your way down here.

28:14.863 --> 28:15.741
So he warned you.

28:15.742 --> 28:18.173
Yeah, he's a good kid. Dependable.

28:24.006 --> 28:25.011
Put 'em on.

28:26.035 --> 28:27.988
Or better yet, resist arrest.

28:28.466 --> 28:29.638
Please.

28:31.147 --> 28:32.955
Some other time, maybe. Huh?

28:42.683 --> 28:44.839
Do you know a woman
named Holly Rhodes, Shane?

28:44.952 --> 28:47.070
- Name sounds familiar.
- Well, it should.

28:47.939 --> 28:49.260
You ran with her back in the day.

28:49.261 --> 28:51.659
Oh, she ran, but not with me.

28:51.713 --> 28:53.730
Then why did you bail her
out when she was a teenager?

28:53.731 --> 28:55.462
Well, I got a soft spot for kids, man.

28:55.463 --> 28:56.543
Yeah, yeah.

28:56.544 --> 28:58.850
You're just like a regular Mr. Rogers.

28:59.156 --> 29:00.836
When was the last time you saw her, Shane?

29:01.222 --> 29:02.740
Uh, last time I saw Holly?

29:03.794 --> 29:04.866
Don't recall.

29:04.978 --> 29:06.487
Well, let me help you out with that.

29:06.753 --> 29:08.002
It's three nights ago...

29:08.236 --> 29:09.338
when you killed her.

29:10.015 --> 29:11.215
You're wrong about that.

29:11.216 --> 29:12.563
Mm. I don't think so.

29:12.564 --> 29:15.859
See, when this whole deejaying
gig of Holly's took off...

29:15.860 --> 29:17.661
wealthy clients, penthouses...

29:17.662 --> 29:20.950
you saw a golden,
diamond-encrusted opportunity.

29:20.951 --> 29:22.443
And that's when you pressured Holly

29:22.444 --> 29:24.840
into bringing in Joey
Malone as an assistant.

29:24.841 --> 29:26.823
He'd go in to these fancy parties,

29:26.824 --> 29:28.080
and he'd walk right out the front door

29:28.081 --> 29:30.288
with a half a million in high-end jewelry,

29:30.289 --> 29:31.878
and your hands would stay clean.

29:32.304 --> 29:34.997
Well, you are right
about that part at least.

29:35.406 --> 29:36.686
My hands are clean.

29:37.202 --> 29:39.190
But then something went
wrong at this last party.

29:39.220 --> 29:40.661
I mean, maybe Holly pushed back.

29:40.662 --> 29:43.961
Or maybe she wanted you out
of her life, once and for all.

29:43.962 --> 29:47.430
But she knew too much so she had to go.

29:47.711 --> 29:49.065
Look, all I hear you guys saying

29:49.066 --> 29:50.806
is a whole lot of stuff
that you can't prove.

29:50.807 --> 29:54.331
Well, we can prove that
her body was in your trunk.

29:54.332 --> 29:56.592
Fibers stuck to the tarp
that Holly was wrapped in

29:56.593 --> 29:58.242
match your X5.

29:58.831 --> 30:00.412
We're impounding it right now.

30:00.452 --> 30:03.104
Wow. Then I guess you guys
didn't hear about it...

30:03.550 --> 30:06.187
about the little problem I had
with my vehicle this morning.

30:06.188 --> 30:07.899
You see, I got a little careless.

30:07.900 --> 30:09.708
I was, uh, I was lighting a cigarette,

30:09.709 --> 30:13.167
and next thing I know,
whole car catches on fire.

30:13.537 --> 30:16.846
Inside, outside, the carpet...
whole thing burned to a crisp.

30:16.847 --> 30:17.668
I hate to tell you,

30:17.669 --> 30:20.560
but there's probably not
a fiber left to match.

30:21.466 --> 30:23.438
Crazy how things happen sometimes, huh?

30:25.313 --> 30:26.857
So, again,

30:27.404 --> 30:29.798
whole lot of noise that you can't prove.

30:30.051 --> 30:31.188
That being said,

30:32.301 --> 30:33.598
I'd like my lawyer.

30:35.091 --> 30:36.465
I need a minute alone.

30:52.578 --> 30:53.749
You tipped off Shane.

30:55.431 --> 30:57.212
After you bolted last night,

30:57.438 --> 30:58.489
you called him.

30:59.540 --> 31:01.289
Warned him that he was a suspect,

31:01.819 --> 31:03.765
which gave him a chance to torch his car.

31:03.766 --> 31:05.460
Cover up his role in Holly's death.

31:06.080 --> 31:07.478
Congratulations, Joey.

31:08.403 --> 31:09.843
You helped him get away with murder.

31:10.215 --> 31:11.741
Now I'd beat your skinny little ass

31:11.742 --> 31:14.256
for being so stupid if
it'd change anything.

31:14.891 --> 31:17.399
But it won't because, well...

31:17.909 --> 31:19.218
you're so loyal.

31:19.460 --> 31:22.353
Now let's see how Shane returns the favor.

31:26.396 --> 31:27.969
Look, I can see that you're a little slow,

31:27.970 --> 31:30.934
but I just said, "I want my lawyer."

31:30.935 --> 31:32.631
This is about the thefts.

31:33.942 --> 31:35.341
Somebody's gonna have to go down for 'em,

31:35.342 --> 31:36.906
and we know it's gonna be Joey Malone.

31:37.428 --> 31:39.955
The D.A. wants to try him as an adult.

31:40.392 --> 31:41.805
That means hard time.

31:42.628 --> 31:45.606
All you gotta do is man up.

31:45.982 --> 31:47.622
Man up about the thefts,

31:47.969 --> 31:49.658
and then maybe I can talk to the D.A.

31:49.759 --> 31:51.043
And get Joey a deal.

31:52.151 --> 31:53.211
Look, man,

31:53.646 --> 31:55.956
if the kid did the crime,
he's gotta do the time.

31:58.801 --> 31:59.960
Have you seen enough?

32:03.843 --> 32:05.215
You still want to protect him?

32:10.691 --> 32:11.700
Look...

32:13.189 --> 32:14.425
it was like you said.

32:14.603 --> 32:15.984
I'd go in with Holly,

32:16.235 --> 32:17.574
lift pricey jewelry,

32:18.047 --> 32:19.213
the more the better.

32:21.498 --> 32:23.039
But this time, it was different.

32:23.631 --> 32:24.511
Why?

32:24.512 --> 32:27.580
Shane told me my mark
was this music producer,

32:28.349 --> 32:29.769
- Tyrese...
- Tyrese Wilton?

32:29.770 --> 32:32.356
Yeah, him. It was weird.

32:34.107 --> 32:35.853
I was supposed to boost his cell phone.

32:36.422 --> 32:37.666
Why his cell phone?

32:37.756 --> 32:40.491
I don't know, but I took it.

32:40.492 --> 32:41.712
Yeah, and then what?

32:41.855 --> 32:45.460
Somehow Holly found out, and she flipped.

32:45.461 --> 32:47.837
She got in my face and told
me to give the phone back.

32:47.838 --> 32:49.995
And I got scared because
I knew she carried heat,

32:50.400 --> 32:52.686
but I had already handed
the phone off to Shane.

32:52.756 --> 32:55.185
So I... I got outta there, and...

32:56.328 --> 32:57.948
that was the last time I saw her.

32:58.961 --> 33:00.911
I didn't know she would end up dead.

33:01.582 --> 33:03.127
I didn't know Shane would kill her.

33:05.218 --> 33:07.354
So no doubt a guy like
Shane would kill her,

33:07.355 --> 33:09.005
but it's starting to look like he didn't.

33:09.006 --> 33:09.969
He's got an alibi.

33:09.970 --> 33:10.836
I don't believe it.

33:10.837 --> 33:12.772
Affidavits from six bar patrons,

33:12.773 --> 33:14.444
all stating that Shane was there

33:14.445 --> 33:15.635
between 11:00 and midnight.

33:15.636 --> 33:16.744
Well, he practically runs the place,

33:16.745 --> 33:18.349
so the patrons will say what he tells 'em.

33:18.350 --> 33:20.040
So C.S.U. just confirmed that his car

33:20.041 --> 33:22.027
was too burned for them
to match the fibers

33:22.028 --> 33:23.069
or pull forensics.

33:23.070 --> 33:25.439
So we can't even prove that
he transported the Vic's body.

33:25.440 --> 33:27.427
We also can't tie the
murder weapon to him either.

33:27.428 --> 33:29.247
According to her assistant Paul,

33:29.248 --> 33:32.033
Holly used to carry around
a .380 pistol for protection.

33:32.034 --> 33:33.557
She might have been
killed with her own gun.

33:33.558 --> 33:34.809
Here's something that doesn't add up...

33:34.810 --> 33:36.168
Tyrese Wilton's phone.

33:36.169 --> 33:37.816
Why would Shane tell Joey

33:37.817 --> 33:39.991
to steal a phone worth a
couple of hundred bucks?

33:39.992 --> 33:42.238
Especially when there had to
be so much bling at that party.

33:42.239 --> 33:44.652
Dude, nobody says "bling"
anymore. Try "shine."

33:44.653 --> 33:46.003
There's something else
that doesn't add up.

33:46.004 --> 33:47.395
All the guests were contacted and asked

33:47.396 --> 33:49.084
if they were missing any personal items.

33:49.085 --> 33:50.494
They all said no, so...

33:50.495 --> 33:52.112
Why didn't Tyrese Wilton mention

33:52.113 --> 33:53.787
that his phone was gone?

34:03.711 --> 34:06.024
Check this out. "Yang Dynasty."

34:06.025 --> 34:07.966
Could explain the peanut
oil on Holly's clothes.

34:18.465 --> 34:19.826
There's blood spatter on the wall.

34:22.174 --> 34:23.616
Looks like we found our crime scene.

34:23.617 --> 34:26.369
Yep, and it's right at Tyrese's doorstep.

34:32.251 --> 34:33.844
Are you saying that Holly was killed

34:33.846 --> 34:35.485
just outside my studio?

34:35.520 --> 34:36.449
That's right.

34:37.301 --> 34:39.261
So why don't you tell us
what she was doing here?

34:39.668 --> 34:40.882
How the hell should I know?

34:40.884 --> 34:42.197
Mm. Well, then maybe you can tell us

34:42.199 --> 34:43.708
what you were doing
between 11:00 and midnight

34:43.710 --> 34:44.474
the night of the party.

34:44.475 --> 34:45.667
I was at the party.

34:46.001 --> 34:47.364
I stayed there till just after 1:00.

34:47.364 --> 34:48.014
You can check.

34:48.016 --> 34:49.860
You were also asked if any
of your stuff went missing

34:49.860 --> 34:50.940
the night of the party.

34:50.942 --> 34:52.031
You didn't mention your phone.

34:52.032 --> 34:53.556
Because my phone wasn't missing.

34:53.561 --> 34:54.630
You don't have to lie to me, Tyrese.

34:54.632 --> 34:55.754
I talked to the kid who stole it.

34:55.755 --> 34:57.498
I mean, it was missing for an hour or two,

34:57.499 --> 34:58.408
but then it turned up.

34:58.409 --> 35:01.020
See? I found it in the bathroom
at the end of the night.

35:01.443 --> 35:02.215
If Joey stole the phone,

35:02.216 --> 35:03.454
how'd it end up back at the party?

35:03.455 --> 35:05.375
Whoever brought that back
didn't want it missed.

35:05.504 --> 35:06.607
Based on Shane's M.O.,

35:06.608 --> 35:09.011
he was after something valuable,
something he could sell.

35:09.567 --> 35:10.872
Yo, Tyrese, what's on that phone...

35:10.873 --> 35:13.365
financial info, pictures, valuable data?

35:13.366 --> 35:15.162
Only one thing that really matters...

35:15.168 --> 35:16.769
I use this phone as an E-key.

35:17.078 --> 35:17.986
An E-key?

35:17.987 --> 35:20.845
An electronic key. It
opens up this studio.

35:21.320 --> 35:22.485
Well, did Holly know that?

35:22.486 --> 35:24.588
Yeah, I mentioned it to her
when I discovered it was gone.

35:24.589 --> 35:25.782
I went to text her my number,

35:25.783 --> 35:27.718
but I had to write it on her hand instead.

35:27.969 --> 35:29.139
That's why Holly was here.

35:29.140 --> 35:30.944
She realized that Shane stole the phone

35:30.945 --> 35:32.449
because he was gonna rip the studio off.

35:32.450 --> 35:33.416
She couldn't let that happen,

35:33.417 --> 35:35.196
not with Tyrese here about
to give her her big break.

35:35.197 --> 35:37.349
Right, so she races over
here to confront Shane

35:37.350 --> 35:39.128
to stop him before he ripped you off.

35:39.129 --> 35:41.145
Looks like she did,
because nothing's missing.

35:41.200 --> 35:42.165
You sure?

35:42.166 --> 35:44.088
Positive. I got over $2
mil in equipment here.

35:44.089 --> 35:45.079
And nothing...

35:46.001 --> 35:47.042
Oh, God.

35:47.555 --> 35:49.391
- What?
- The recordings.

35:49.392 --> 35:51.884
If someone got their hands
on an unreleased album...

35:52.247 --> 35:53.848
It'd be worth a fortune.

35:54.038 --> 35:56.951
Not to mention tanking our
record sales if it leaked online.

35:59.750 --> 36:01.595
Oh, no. Josie Lang's album

36:01.596 --> 36:03.468
was accessed at 11:45
the night of the party.

36:03.469 --> 36:04.967
Someone downloaded the masters.

36:06.287 --> 36:07.341
Shane.

36:07.751 --> 36:10.814
Look, I'm telling you,
Shane's alibi is rock-solid.

36:10.815 --> 36:11.810
How is that even possible?

36:11.811 --> 36:13.101
We interviewed everyone in the bar.

36:13.102 --> 36:14.705
We even talked to the cabbies outside,

36:14.706 --> 36:16.466
and everyone said that
he left around midnight.

36:16.467 --> 36:17.588
Why would he torch his car

36:17.589 --> 36:18.890
if he didn't use it to dump her body?

36:18.891 --> 36:20.013
He might have dumped the body,

36:20.014 --> 36:22.698
but our timeline says
that he did not kill her.

36:22.873 --> 36:23.941
Man.

36:25.566 --> 36:26.445
W... wait a minute. We... we...

36:26.446 --> 36:27.625
we gotta be missing something here

36:27.626 --> 36:29.017
so let's just go over it again.

36:29.080 --> 36:31.902
We know that Joey handed
Shane that phone around 11:00.

36:31.903 --> 36:35.237
And we know that Josie's
album was downloaded at 11:45.

36:35.238 --> 36:37.457
Holly was murdered sometime
between 11:00 and midnight.

36:37.458 --> 36:38.509
Wait a minute.

36:38.931 --> 36:41.913
The key to this whole thing is that phone.

36:41.914 --> 36:42.829
We're assuming that Shane

36:42.830 --> 36:44.505
was the one who used it
to break in to the studio.

36:44.506 --> 36:45.910
Because he's the one that
Joey gave the phone to.

36:45.911 --> 36:48.986
Right, but witnesses place him
at the bar, 11:30 to midnight.

36:48.987 --> 36:51.738
The album was downloaded
at the studio at 11:45.

36:51.739 --> 36:53.956
- It had to be someone else.
- Like who?

36:55.895 --> 36:57.529
Well, it had to be someone from the party.

36:57.530 --> 36:59.409
So then whoever broke in to the studio

36:59.410 --> 37:01.690
must have returned the phone to the party

37:01.691 --> 37:04.388
so that Tyrese wouldn't
realize that it was even taken.

37:04.776 --> 37:06.280
All we have to do is figure out

37:06.281 --> 37:08.529
which one of the guests
had something to gain

37:08.630 --> 37:10.246
from stealing Josie's album.

37:12.692 --> 37:15.405
One, two. Five. Six. Seven. Eight.

37:15.406 --> 37:17.759
Rock one, two, three, four.

37:17.760 --> 37:20.203
Step. Nice. Good.

37:20.204 --> 37:21.385
Point again.

37:22.190 --> 37:23.234
Hi.

37:23.687 --> 37:24.484
Did you guys not get

37:24.485 --> 37:26.346
the guest list that we sent over?

37:26.347 --> 37:27.938
Yeah, we... we did.

37:27.939 --> 37:29.260
We just need to ask you a few questions

37:29.261 --> 37:31.555
about your schedule the
night of the party.

37:32.637 --> 37:34.156
Yeah, sure.

37:36.645 --> 37:38.194
So according to your party planner,

37:38.195 --> 37:40.717
you excused yourself at
11:00 to do a costume change

37:40.718 --> 37:42.882
for a performance of a
track from your new album.

37:42.883 --> 37:43.743
Is that correct?

37:43.744 --> 37:45.005
That sounds about right,

37:45.092 --> 37:46.728
but I just go where they tell me to.

37:46.729 --> 37:47.591
You know how it is.

37:47.592 --> 37:50.185
Only your planner told
us that you insisted

37:50.186 --> 37:51.407
on having a full hour.

37:51.408 --> 37:54.414
Have you ever tried changing
into skintight leather pants?

37:54.415 --> 37:55.775
It's time-consuming.

37:55.810 --> 37:57.338
Why? What's... what's the point?

37:57.339 --> 37:59.071
Well, that hour gave you enough time

37:59.072 --> 38:01.150
to get to Tyrese Wilton's studio,

38:01.151 --> 38:02.889
download Josie's new album,

38:02.890 --> 38:05.444
and get back to the party
to perform your song.

38:05.696 --> 38:07.388
Are you insane?

38:07.389 --> 38:09.531
Why would I do anything like that?

38:09.532 --> 38:12.213
Because your album sales
have been sagging for years.

38:12.462 --> 38:13.781
If your album didn't perform,

38:13.782 --> 38:15.508
your record label was gonna drop you.

38:15.509 --> 38:18.034
I've been with harmony 360 for 10 years.

38:18.035 --> 38:18.801
They love me.

38:18.802 --> 38:20.699
It's no secret that
Josie Lang's eclipsed you.

38:20.700 --> 38:23.037
Oh, please. She's been
around for two seconds.

38:23.038 --> 38:25.459
Give it a year, you won't
even remember her name.

38:25.460 --> 38:26.434
It doesn't matter.

38:26.435 --> 38:28.214
Both your albums come out next week,

38:28.215 --> 38:29.563
and she's going to crush you.

38:29.564 --> 38:31.992
Unless someone mysteriously leaks

38:31.993 --> 38:33.802
Josie's new album online.

38:33.845 --> 38:35.553
Your plan was simple...

38:35.554 --> 38:37.384
hire Shane to steal the phone,

38:37.385 --> 38:39.024
that way, you can get in to the studio.

38:39.025 --> 38:40.902
The one thing that you
didn't plan on was Holly.

38:40.903 --> 38:42.170
She showed up and caught you

38:42.171 --> 38:43.771
just as you were leaving the studio.

38:43.772 --> 38:45.505
You couldn't risk her exposing you.

38:45.508 --> 38:46.452
You fought.

38:46.453 --> 38:48.285
She pulled out her gun to protect herself,

38:48.286 --> 38:50.042
but you managed to use it on her instead.

38:50.043 --> 38:52.314
So you called Shane and you
got him to get rid of the body.

38:52.315 --> 38:54.929
Are you kidding me?
That's all speculation.

38:54.930 --> 38:56.487
The one thing that's not speculation

38:56.488 --> 38:58.555
is that you hired D.J. Beat.

38:58.733 --> 38:59.774
How'd you find out about her?

38:59.775 --> 39:00.703
Word of mouth.

39:00.704 --> 39:03.359
More like your bodyguard
grew up with Shane Winters.

39:03.360 --> 39:05.269
Shane had you hire D.J. Beat

39:05.270 --> 39:07.533
so that Joey could get
in and steal that phone.

39:07.534 --> 39:09.062
You know what else isn't speculation?

39:09.063 --> 39:11.396
The warrant she served on your I.S.P.

39:11.397 --> 39:12.967
That warrant revealed

39:12.968 --> 39:14.884
the e-mail account that you created

39:14.885 --> 39:16.335
to communicate with the hacker

39:16.336 --> 39:18.885
that was going to leak
Josie's new album online.

39:18.886 --> 39:20.229
Is that enough fact for you?

39:24.384 --> 39:26.524
My record sales may be down,

39:26.525 --> 39:29.080
but I can still afford a damn good lawyer.

39:46.272 --> 39:47.951
You keep showing up here like this,

39:48.463 --> 39:49.887
my boys are gonna think
you're sweet on me.

39:49.888 --> 39:51.164
Not anymore, they won't.

39:52.960 --> 39:56.873
You are walking on grand larceny
and accessory after the fact.

39:57.295 --> 40:00.991
Wow. Now that kind of
luck does not last long.

40:01.312 --> 40:03.806
Well, I guess I gotta go play
the powerball, then, tonight.

40:14.723 --> 40:15.928
This is my gun.

40:17.799 --> 40:20.168
And this one will be yours.

40:21.415 --> 40:25.016
You ever go near Joey or
any other kid ever again,

40:25.467 --> 40:26.907
the story's gonna go like this...

40:26.986 --> 40:29.740
you pulled that piece on me.

40:30.180 --> 40:30.990
And...

40:31.163 --> 40:33.233
I had to defend myself, so...

40:35.163 --> 40:36.266
I killed you.

40:37.267 --> 40:38.446
You understand me?

40:39.060 --> 40:42.261
Or should we play out
that story right here,

40:42.664 --> 40:43.753
right now?

40:47.083 --> 40:48.121
I hear you.

40:49.370 --> 40:50.436
Good.

40:55.954 --> 40:56.685
Yo.

40:56.686 --> 40:58.112
Reach back there and grab that file.

40:58.113 --> 40:59.102
What am I, your secretary?

40:59.103 --> 41:00.337
Just grab the file.

41:01.957 --> 41:04.378
Look, haven't I done enough
to solve this case for you?

41:04.379 --> 41:05.349
Read it.

41:06.880 --> 41:10.701
"Juvenile record for Javier Esposito."

41:11.179 --> 41:12.097
Yep.

41:12.301 --> 41:13.613
The good ol' days.

41:14.384 --> 41:17.054
So "assault, resisting arrest"...

41:17.171 --> 41:18.716
- Mm.
- "Unlawful possession."

41:18.920 --> 41:19.632
Yeah.

41:19.633 --> 41:20.731
You were a mess.

41:20.732 --> 41:23.474
Yeah, but that's all I knew.

41:23.638 --> 41:26.293
Dad was gone, my mom was working two jobs.

41:26.328 --> 41:28.080
In my neighborhood, you had to do

41:28.081 --> 41:29.547
what you had to do to survive.

41:29.985 --> 41:31.313
Not everybody made it.

41:33.155 --> 41:34.990
Is this where you tell me that I need to

41:34.991 --> 41:37.364
man up and get my act
together like you did?

41:37.365 --> 41:39.035
No. It doesn't work like that.

41:39.415 --> 41:40.372
You need help.

41:40.965 --> 41:42.520
For me, it was one of my teachers.

41:43.340 --> 41:47.140
Saw a future in me that I
didn't even see in myself.

41:47.341 --> 41:49.255
But it was up to me to make the choice,

41:49.414 --> 41:50.955
to pick which road to go down.

41:51.584 --> 41:52.762
I talked to your school counselor.

41:52.763 --> 41:55.559
- What?
- She's gonna call me if you keep ditching.

41:55.560 --> 41:56.894
Come on, man.

41:56.895 --> 41:58.443
And I'm gonna call you once a week,

41:59.249 --> 42:00.408
check in.

42:05.170 --> 42:06.200
All right, I'll go...

42:06.685 --> 42:08.614
if you agree to get new furniture.

42:09.594 --> 42:10.830
You can't get laid on the regular

42:10.831 --> 42:12.140
with that junk you have.

42:12.141 --> 42:13.362
I'm just looking out for you.

42:15.588 --> 42:16.576
Here.

42:17.129 --> 42:18.353
If you need anything,

42:18.485 --> 42:19.545
day or night,

42:19.651 --> 42:21.119
you call me at that number.

42:22.713 --> 42:23.667
Okay.

42:24.727 --> 42:25.766
You're all right...

42:25.767 --> 42:26.722
for a cop.

42:27.590 --> 42:28.551
I know.

42:28.799 --> 42:30.128
Now get out of my car.
