00:10.904 --> 00:12.959
Cheers, Lumpy Space Princess.

00:17.897 --> 00:20.498
Princess, this tea party sucks
in a big way!

00:20.522 --> 00:21.748
But thanks for the invite!

00:21.780 --> 00:23.319
Oh, don't worry, Finn.

00:23.342 --> 00:26.756
<i>The Mallow Tea Ceremony
takes years to master.</i>

00:26.827 --> 00:29.436
Princess! I think I just now mastered it!

00:30.468 --> 00:31.405
One more bounce.

00:31.569 --> 00:32.647
Alright!

00:33.640 --> 00:35.913
Tea partying's hard, huh, Jake?

00:35.968 --> 00:36.718
Oof! Yes!

00:36.734 --> 00:37.257
What?!?

00:37.320 --> 00:39.382
No way! It's super easy!

00:39.398 --> 00:41.789
Lumpy Space Princess, you big faker!

00:41.812 --> 00:43.726
<i>You're floating, not bouncing!</i>

00:43.750 --> 00:45.343
Fine. I'll prove it.

00:49.422 --> 00:51.945
Oh. Sorry I bit your leg.

00:51.961 --> 00:53.461
<i>You're still biting me!!</i>

00:53.485 --> 00:55.640
Oh, my gosh. Oh, right. Sorry.

00:55.656 --> 00:57.016
Dude! Your leg!

00:57.054 --> 00:58.906
<i>This is... new.</i>

00:58.929 --> 01:01.008
'S nothin' ominous, though. Just a bump.

01:01.023 --> 01:04.593
Nah, that's no bump.
It's the early stage of the lumps.

01:04.625 --> 01:06.171
Is it serious?

01:06.195 --> 01:09.336
It just means he's turning into
a Lumpy Space guy,

01:09.351 --> 01:10.758
on account of my bite.

01:10.781 --> 01:11.836
It's just like, uhm...

01:11.851 --> 01:12.742
...y'know...

01:12.765 --> 01:13.914
...werewolf rules?

01:15.742 --> 01:16.531
Oh no!!!

01:16.546 --> 01:19.054
What? You think I'm gonna turn
all lumpy like her?

01:19.078 --> 01:19.936
Get outta here.

01:20.265 --> 01:20.788
Wha?!?

01:20.984 --> 01:22.890
Finn, I think I'm freakin' out!

01:22.913 --> 01:24.429
Calm down, bud! I'll...

01:24.445 --> 01:26.070
<i>I'll sock the lumpiness outta ya!</i>

01:26.085 --> 01:27.015
Hey, now!

01:28.687 --> 01:30.085
Royal intervention!

01:30.108 --> 01:32.804
Surely there must be an antidote
to the lumps.

01:32.827 --> 01:37.389
Yeah. There's an antidote, but you have
to go all the way to Lumpy Space to get it

01:37.421 --> 01:39.866
and, Jake has to use it by sunset.

01:39.882 --> 01:42.944
<i>What happens if he doesn't
take the antidote by sunset?</i>

01:42.968 --> 01:45.038
He'll be lumpy, like, forever.

01:45.062 --> 01:47.913
LSP, please! Can you tell us
how to reach Lumpy Space?

01:47.929 --> 01:49.968
Yeah, there's a portal nearby.

01:49.991 --> 01:51.609
I can show you whenever.

01:51.624 --> 01:53.538
<i>Take us now! Take us now!</i>

01:54.811 --> 01:56.421
I should not have drunk that much tea!

01:56.881 --> 01:59.560
Don't go telling anyone about this
portal or whatever.

01:59.584 --> 02:00.568
...It's kind of a secret.

02:02.897 --> 02:03.904
Where is it?

02:03.928 --> 02:05.717
Portal's that Frog and mushroom.

02:06.928 --> 02:08.357
Password, please.

02:08.381 --> 02:09.951
Whatevers2009!!!

02:09.975 --> 02:11.561
Good day, Princess.

02:11.584 --> 02:16.998
Is your father okay with you entering
Lumpy Space with two...

02:17.021 --> 02:18.912
...non-Lumpers?

02:18.936 --> 02:19.788
Just say yes!

02:19.811 --> 02:21.280
Yes, yes, yes!

02:21.303 --> 02:22.460
Yeah, whatever, fine.

02:28.592 --> 02:30.045
Whoa...

02:30.076 --> 02:31.592
Lumpy Space!

02:33.662 --> 02:35.506
So, where's the antidote?

02:35.537 --> 02:37.506
Hold it. First, you should
check out my house.

02:37.529 --> 02:41.529
It's, like, kinda lame, but way less
lame than, like, your house.

02:41.802 --> 02:45.006
Could you skip to the part where
you tell us where the antidote is?

02:45.036 --> 02:46.990
It's up there at Makeout Point.

02:47.021 --> 02:49.154
That's so close! We can run there in no...

02:49.177 --> 02:50.169
...time.

02:50.185 --> 02:51.708
<i>Aww, what?!?</i>

02:51.732 --> 02:54.185
It's, like, a million-mile fall into space!

02:54.209 --> 02:56.904
Yeah. You have to travel
by car in my world,

02:56.930 --> 02:59.241
or else you'll fall into the Lumpy Abyss.

02:59.266 --> 03:03.235
Daughter!! Have you brought smooth
people into our domain?!?

03:03.258 --> 03:03.797
I...

03:03.828 --> 03:04.703
<i>...had to...</i>

03:04.727 --> 03:05.321
...dad.

03:05.352 --> 03:07.321
<i>I'm trying to help them.</i>

03:07.344 --> 03:09.336
So don't LUMPING YELL AT MEH!!!

03:09.367 --> 03:10.891
WHAT DID YOU SAY?!?

03:10.922 --> 03:13.047
What did you just say?!?

03:13.078 --> 03:16.196
I SAID, "LUMP OFF," MOM!!!

03:18.758 --> 03:19.453
Uh...

03:19.484 --> 03:20.062
WHAT?!?

03:20.078 --> 03:21.086
Vroom vroom?

03:21.110 --> 03:21.742
Oh, yeah!

03:21.828 --> 03:23.086
I need to borrow the car.

03:23.110 --> 03:26.649
<i>You have made your mother cry
for the last time, daughter!</i>

03:26.680 --> 03:29.883
<i>You are hereby banned from
using the royal car!!</i>

03:29.914 --> 03:32.711
Shucks! I lumping hate them!

03:32.735 --> 03:35.000
I'm really really sorry, Finn.

03:35.032 --> 03:39.079
But I can't help you because
my parents are horrible idiots.

03:39.110 --> 03:40.907
Don't you know anyone else with a car?

03:40.938 --> 03:42.579
My friend Melissa has a car.

03:42.602 --> 03:44.547
But she's dating my ex-boyfriend...

03:44.571 --> 03:45.063
...Brad.

03:45.087 --> 03:46.087
Call her...

03:46.118 --> 03:47.173
...NOW.

03:47.188 --> 03:50.243
Hmm. Call BFF 66.

03:51.829 --> 03:52.664
Hello?

03:52.687 --> 03:53.915
Hey, Melissa. What's up?

03:53.946 --> 03:54.766
What's she saying?

03:54.789 --> 03:56.321
<i>I'm asking her, jeez!</i>

03:56.352 --> 03:57.938
Melissa, just listen!

03:57.985 --> 03:59.860
Have you forgotten what day it is?

03:59.883 --> 04:01.672
Melissa. I'm trying to help
out some friends.

04:01.696 --> 04:05.102
Tonight is the weekly Promcoming Dance!

04:05.125 --> 04:06.688
Oh, Glob. I forgot.

04:06.719 --> 04:07.555
<i>What'd she say?</i>

04:07.586 --> 04:10.492
Tonight is the weekly Promcoming Dance!

04:10.516 --> 04:12.297
IT'S GONNA BE SO FLIPPIN' AWESOME!!

04:12.321 --> 04:14.453
LSP, we don't have time for this.

04:14.477 --> 04:16.781
Ask for the ride, LSP

04:20.101 --> 04:20.531
Wha?!?

04:20.571 --> 04:25.110
Melissa, you should totally drive us
to Makeout Point to...

04:25.136 --> 04:27.385
...make out with hot boys!

04:27.417 --> 04:31.261
<i>LSP, you're so baaaaad...</i>

04:31.292 --> 04:32.463
Be there in a sec!

04:32.487 --> 04:33.409
Biyah.

04:34.206 --> 04:36.706
Sorry. But Jake's lumpiness is worsening!

04:36.737 --> 04:40.019
Actually, I think I'm beating it back
with sheer willpower!

04:40.534 --> 04:41.253
Oh, my.

04:42.081 --> 04:42.815
Yeah, whatever.

04:42.839 --> 04:44.589
Just don't mess with my phone again.

04:44.612 --> 04:45.245
Hi!

04:47.956 --> 04:49.932
Ugh... OKAY!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!!

04:53.906 --> 04:55.937
Aw, Finn, this music ducks, right?

04:56.655 --> 04:58.312
Ah. I love this song.

04:58.343 --> 05:00.672
We should totally TP Shandala's house!

05:01.437 --> 05:03.242
Gracious!! That was terrible!

05:03.351 --> 05:06.140
Finn, if you can't save me
from the lumps...

05:06.164 --> 05:08.375
<i>if I do turn...</i>

05:08.406 --> 05:11.375
...if I become lumpy like them,
I want you to...

05:11.398 --> 05:12.859
It's not gonna come to that!

05:12.882 --> 05:16.625
But if it does, I'll bury you beneath
the nicest, most shadiest tree!

05:16.656 --> 05:18.273
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

05:18.297 --> 05:21.047
<i>I'm saying that if I go totally lumpy,</i>

05:21.070 --> 05:23.476
then I want you to get used to lumpy Jake.

05:23.499 --> 05:25.249
<i>What did you think I was sayin'?</i>

05:27.000 --> 05:28.734
CAN'T THIS CAR GO ANY FASTER?!

05:28.750 --> 05:30.164
We're already here!

05:30.172 --> 05:31.281
Hi, Finn.

05:31.305 --> 05:33.164
We've been here for, like,
five minutes.

05:33.180 --> 05:34.312
Finally!

05:34.344 --> 05:36.820
Huh? This doesn't look
like Makeout Point.

05:36.859 --> 05:38.117
This is Brad's house.

05:38.148 --> 05:41.078
<i>You wanted a ride to Makeout Point?</i>

05:41.094 --> 05:44.117
<i>You think I want to make out with you?!?</i>

05:44.899 --> 05:48.148
Well, maybe I do, but...

05:48.180 --> 05:50.852
Wait. I have a boyfriend, Finn!!!

05:51.852 --> 05:54.797
LSP, we gotta hurry!
Jake's running out of time!

05:54.836 --> 05:56.922
Hey. This is hard for me, too.

05:56.946 --> 05:59.446
I mean, I used to eat chili
cheese fries with Brad...

05:59.477 --> 06:02.406
so there's gonna be a lot of
romantic tension on this ride!

06:02.423 --> 06:02.962
Hey.

06:02.985 --> 06:05.305
Oh, Braaaaad...

06:06.157 --> 06:07.883
You miss me yet, LSP?

06:07.954 --> 06:11.094
Scooch over, Finn.
I'm gonna sit in the back.

06:12.204 --> 06:13.188
This is it.

06:14.642 --> 06:15.336
Let's go!

06:15.351 --> 06:17.133
Wait. Watch yourself, Finn.

06:17.165 --> 06:20.400
The guys who use the antidote
up here are notorious...

06:20.423 --> 06:21.228
...for being...

06:21.244 --> 06:23.415
...smooth posers!

06:23.447 --> 06:24.658
<i>What does that mean?</i>

06:24.682 --> 06:26.064
It just means what it means.

06:26.088 --> 06:28.471
<i>Hurry. Get the antidote
so we can get outta here.</i>

06:28.494 --> 06:29.479
Thanks, LSP.

06:29.979 --> 06:31.463
Buuuumps...

06:32.807 --> 06:33.978
Um... bumps.

06:34.534 --> 06:35.557
Aw, man!

06:37.346 --> 06:38.213
Hey, guys.

06:38.557 --> 06:39.604
Lookin' smooth!

06:39.627 --> 06:41.823
Really? You think we're smooth?

06:41.846 --> 06:43.760
Well, mostly you in the center, but yeah!

06:43.776 --> 06:45.400
Why are you sucking up to us?

06:45.416 --> 06:47.385
My best friend needs an antidote
for lumpiness.

06:47.409 --> 06:49.455
Chyah, lumpiness suuucks.

06:49.472 --> 06:51.229
Hey, Monty, time's up, sphere-hog!

06:51.596 --> 06:52.401
My turn!

06:54.080 --> 06:56.900
So the antidote is in that orb
you were sitting on!

06:56.924 --> 06:59.807
<i>This orb is the antidote, bruh.</i>

06:59.822 --> 07:00.854
Can my friend borrow it?

07:00.877 --> 07:02.807
Yeah, sure, as long as you
give it right back.

07:03.588 --> 07:05.072
Hammacow. Thanks, fellas.

07:05.221 --> 07:06.557
<i>What's taking so long?</i>

07:06.583 --> 07:09.315
<i>Did those smooth-heads
give you the orb already, or what?</i>

07:09.330 --> 07:09.893
Wait!!

07:09.908 --> 07:12.346
<i>Is this another friend of yours??</i>

07:12.353 --> 07:13.087
What do you care?

07:13.113 --> 07:16.049
Just give 'em the antidote already,
and stop being such a poser.

07:16.056 --> 07:18.892
Sorry, kid. We changed our minds.

07:18.915 --> 07:21.540
Why did you have to say all those
rude things to them?!?

07:21.563 --> 07:23.165
What? I was helping you.

07:23.181 --> 07:24.024
Thanks a lot!

07:24.048 --> 07:25.985
They were right about to hand
over the antidote!

07:26.001 --> 07:27.009
<i>You're welcome a lot.</i>

07:27.009 --> 07:27.868
You insulted them!

07:27.876 --> 07:28.720
And they got mad!

07:28.735 --> 07:30.774
<i>And now Jake's gonna be lumpy forever!</i>

07:30.814 --> 07:32.321
This is all your fault!!!

07:32.337 --> 07:34.087
<i>Wow. Now I know how you really feel.</i>

07:34.103 --> 07:36.212
I was just trying to help, but whatever.

07:37.501 --> 07:39.869
<i>No. No, not whatever!</i>

07:39.977 --> 07:43.181
I know I mess things up sometimes,
but I'm really trying!

07:43.204 --> 07:45.313
And you guys are supposed to be my friends!

07:45.336 --> 07:47.532
<i>Not like the fake ones I have here!</i>

07:47.555 --> 07:48.882
So do what you want!

07:48.905 --> 07:51.202
I'm going to Promcoming!

07:51.336 --> 07:53.625
Are you coming or not, Lumpy Jake?

07:53.640 --> 07:57.055
No. Because no matter how messed up
and lumpy I get,

07:57.078 --> 07:59.711
this guy never turns his back on me!

07:59.844 --> 08:02.016
Oh, yah. Right behind ya.

08:02.023 --> 08:03.819
Just gotta turn my back on this guy.

08:04.640 --> 08:06.905
Jake! It's almost sunset!!!

08:07.140 --> 08:07.804
Jake...

08:07.811 --> 08:09.367
...I didn't save him...

08:09.390 --> 08:10.320
I...

08:13.929 --> 08:17.766
I'LL KILL YOU LUMPY SPACE!!!

08:17.788 --> 08:18.670
Jam on, man!

08:18.678 --> 08:20.037
Huh? I thought you guys left!

08:20.045 --> 08:22.358
We were drawn back by your plaintive wail.

08:22.366 --> 08:24.335
We dig your directionless fury.

08:24.342 --> 08:25.483
Um, thanks.

08:25.500 --> 08:26.617
Respect.

08:26.734 --> 08:27.577
Here...

08:28.601 --> 08:30.531
Take it. Win your girl back!

08:30.539 --> 08:31.765
Yeah, there's no girl.

08:31.772 --> 08:33.664
<i>But there is still time to save Jake!</i>

08:33.679 --> 08:35.506
Do you guys know where Promcoming is?!?

08:35.554 --> 08:38.726
Promcoming takes place way down
on that land-lump.

08:38.741 --> 08:40.741
Awesome. Do any of y'all have wheels?

08:40.758 --> 08:43.530
Nah. We were all ditched here
just like you.

08:43.563 --> 08:46.680
Well... you think I can make it to that
land-lump if I jumped off this cliff?

08:46.696 --> 08:47.727
You kidding?

08:47.753 --> 08:50.518
A smoothie like you will plummet right
into the eternal void!

08:50.566 --> 08:52.667
<i>What if I was lumpy? Could I float over?</i>

08:52.691 --> 08:55.362
No, no! It's too dangerous!

08:55.441 --> 08:58.332
I'd say there's a 50/50 chance
of you making it!

08:58.347 --> 08:59.488
That's good enough for me.

08:59.496 --> 09:00.449
<i>Now bite me!!</i>

09:00.465 --> 09:02.137
Are you crazy, man?

09:05.691 --> 09:09.526
Yes! I can feel the multiple bite
accelerating the lumpification process!

09:10.019 --> 09:11.246
I'm starting to float!

09:11.253 --> 09:12.527
Don't jump, guy!!

09:12.542 --> 09:14.378
I have to! For my buddy.

09:16.776 --> 09:18.394
Wow. He's insane.

09:20.190 --> 09:21.089
Ah, I made it!

09:21.089 --> 09:22.236
And there he is!

09:22.252 --> 09:23.987
Yeah! Promcoming! Yeah! Cool!

09:24.002 --> 09:25.846
Jake! I'm mostly lumpy now!

09:25.861 --> 09:28.650
And I totally think you should
sit on this sphere!

09:28.666 --> 09:29.338
No!

09:29.345 --> 09:30.283
Sit on it!

09:31.830 --> 09:32.588
No!

09:32.596 --> 09:33.189
Please, Jake!

09:33.197 --> 09:36.268
You're my best friend!
Just sit on the sphere!

09:36.283 --> 09:38.048
Chyah! I remember you!

09:38.064 --> 09:40.603
You're just a smoothie wannabe lumpy poser!

09:40.611 --> 09:43.283
<i>Sit on it!!
Before I turn completely lumpy!!</i>

09:43.298 --> 09:44.072
No!

09:44.111 --> 09:47.721
Oh, no! I can feel the lumpiness...
about to consume me!!

09:48.572 --> 09:50.533
Oh, yah. Being lumpy's the best.

09:50.558 --> 09:52.923
Hey. Stop talkin' to yourself, dumb guy.

09:52.956 --> 09:54.386
Take your ball and get outta here.

09:54.410 --> 09:56.151
Fine. I don't want you to have it anyway.

09:56.167 --> 09:57.668
So I can't have it now, eh?

09:57.691 --> 09:59.332
<i>That's right. It's mine.</i>

10:00.113 --> 10:01.136
Gimme that ball!!!

10:01.152 --> 10:02.394
No! You can't have it!

10:02.401 --> 10:03.113
I want it!

10:03.129 --> 10:03.472
No!

10:03.488 --> 10:04.832
Give it to meh!

10:04.847 --> 10:06.949
<i>You want it that bad? Go get it, then!</i>

10:10.910 --> 10:12.777
Oh, I'm not lumpy anymore!

10:12.793 --> 10:13.715
...Oh no...

10:13.816 --> 10:16.027
Finn buddy! Ya gotta sit on this!!

10:16.043 --> 10:16.855
No!!!

10:17.193 --> 10:18.818
You can't make me! Smooth...

10:20.420 --> 10:21.201
Finn...

10:21.216 --> 10:22.201
Hey Finn!

10:22.216 --> 10:23.341
Hey, buddy!

10:23.381 --> 10:24.021
Finn!!!

10:24.052 --> 10:24.513
Huh?!?

10:24.552 --> 10:26.185
Hey, dude. We made it.

10:26.263 --> 10:26.880
Man...

10:27.107 --> 10:28.911
There's something cold under my butt.

10:29.075 --> 10:30.935
Oh! The antidote!

10:31.130 --> 10:32.247
Just in time, too!

10:32.716 --> 10:34.841
LSP, I'm sorry I blew up at you before.

10:34.872 --> 10:37.552
I didn't mean it.
I was just really stressed out.

10:37.567 --> 10:38.692
You know, it's fine.

10:38.718 --> 10:40.256
You and Jake can make it up to me

10:40.269 --> 10:42.605
by dancing this last dance with me.

10:42.708 --> 10:44.927
Sounds good to me. Whaddaya say, Jake?

10:44.965 --> 10:46.817
That sounds totally lame.

10:48.629 --> 10:49.512
I'm just kiddin'.

10:49.531 --> 10:50.234
Let's dance!
