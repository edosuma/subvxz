01:02.079 --> 01:03.679
You're not taking me with you, are you?

01:03.759 --> 01:06.359
Not again, Charlie,
I've told you a thousand times.

01:06.760 --> 01:09.159
The cabins are tiny.
You would really hate it.

01:09.239 --> 01:10.480
No, because...

01:11.079 --> 01:12.920
I'd have Blanda with me.

01:13.599 --> 01:16.359
Look, I'll be back in three months.

01:17.200 --> 01:18.640
So you keep to yourself,

01:18.719 --> 01:20.400
stay out of trouble,
and behave yourself.

01:20.719 --> 01:22.079
Miss Rosa will look after you.

01:22.159 --> 01:23.799
Ok, I'll keep to myself.

01:26.200 --> 01:28.400
- You keep to yourself.
- I'll keep to myself, ok.

01:28.480 --> 01:30.799
But when you take me,
I can touch the horn, right?

01:32.760 --> 01:34.400
- Touch the horn?
- Say I can.

01:34.480 --> 01:37.560
- It's sound the horn, Charlie.
- Yes, yes, sound.

01:37.640 --> 01:39.640
That's not up to me,
it's up to the Captain.

01:39.719 --> 01:40.799
Sound, the Captain.

01:40.879 --> 01:42.640
- He has to give you permission.
- Yes.

01:43.040 --> 01:43.959
Will you ask him?

01:44.799 --> 01:47.000
- I promise I will.
- So you're going to take me.

01:47.959 --> 01:49.200
- One day.
- Ok.

01:49.799 --> 01:51.439
- One day, bro.
- Ok.

01:53.120 --> 01:54.079
Have a good trip.

01:55.799 --> 01:56.799
Thank you, Charlie.

02:07.280 --> 02:08.560
Come on. Let's go.

02:25.280 --> 02:27.639
Okay, okay, Blanda. We're going home now.

02:30.280 --> 02:31.840
Are you fucking kidding me?

02:31.919 --> 02:33.280
Hey, hey, hey! What's that?

02:33.639 --> 02:35.000
Is there a rat in your pocket?

02:35.080 --> 02:36.159
Look at me!

02:36.560 --> 02:39.599
I want you to go outside right now
and leave that in the fucking street.

02:39.680 --> 02:40.960
Fucking retard.

02:41.039 --> 02:42.159
Come on, hurry up!

02:42.240 --> 02:43.680
You should be locked up!

02:43.759 --> 02:45.479
Locked up in a cage!

02:47.680 --> 02:48.680
Come on, hurry, go.

03:07.080 --> 03:08.400
What the hell are you doing here?

03:08.800 --> 03:09.960
Why aren't you at work?

03:12.039 --> 03:13.919
- What's happened?
- I haven't done anything.

03:14.639 --> 03:16.080
What's happened? What's wrong?

03:17.360 --> 03:18.360
He started it.

03:18.919 --> 03:20.719
- He started it.
- What did he start?

03:20.800 --> 03:21.960
What's happened, Charlie?

04:33.480 --> 04:34.439
I have a pet.

04:36.560 --> 04:37.560
I have a pet.

04:40.040 --> 04:41.000
Her name is...

04:41.560 --> 04:42.519
is Blanda.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.319
It's a rat.

04:48.240 --> 04:49.199
She's my...

04:49.920 --> 04:50.959
my best friend.

04:51.720 --> 04:53.600
So I don't want to call him "disabled",

04:54.639 --> 04:55.600
I want to call him...

04:56.759 --> 05:02.240
He's lucky enough to have been able
not to grow to become an adult

05:02.319 --> 05:05.079
and turn into the shit we all are.

05:09.759 --> 05:11.079
So what do you think?

05:11.600 --> 05:12.519
About what?

05:14.040 --> 05:15.639
About the horn...

05:17.160 --> 05:20.240
Do you think the Captain will let me
if I ask him nicely?

05:20.680 --> 05:23.600
I don't know, Charlie. Maybe another time.

05:23.680 --> 05:25.040
When? When?

05:25.759 --> 05:26.759
Eat everything up.

05:28.920 --> 05:30.639
It's never the right time.

05:42.360 --> 05:43.720
Yes, Captain... You called...

05:46.279 --> 05:47.240
Sit down.

05:57.800 --> 05:58.720
We have bad news.

05:59.720 --> 06:00.920
We have a DNA match.

06:01.519 --> 06:03.560
- It's conclusive.
- Fuck your DNA, man.

06:05.720 --> 06:06.639
It's Charlie.

06:12.720 --> 06:14.000
He didn't do it, Captain.

06:14.680 --> 06:15.800
How can you be so sure?

06:16.160 --> 06:17.199
Because he's my brother!

06:18.759 --> 06:20.079
Tell us something we don't know.

06:21.839 --> 06:23.319
No! No, no.

06:28.560 --> 06:29.519
Captain, please.

06:30.439 --> 06:32.439
You have to believe me,
he is being framed.

06:32.519 --> 06:34.399
We're not judging him here, Oscar.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.600
He will be able to defend himself
when the time comes.

06:37.959 --> 06:39.839
Just like Marcus, right?

06:43.959 --> 06:45.959
The Chilean police
will handle the investigation

06:46.040 --> 06:47.720
when we arrive at ValparaÃ­so.

06:47.800 --> 06:49.800
Until then, we need to lock him up.

06:51.800 --> 06:52.720
I'm sorry, Oscar.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.079
We can't risk it.

06:55.720 --> 06:57.040
We just wanted to let you know.

07:02.920 --> 07:03.959
Charlie!

07:04.040 --> 07:06.879
Charlie!

07:06.959 --> 07:08.519
- What's going on?
- Charlie.

07:13.439 --> 07:14.600
You drugged his food?

07:14.680 --> 07:15.639
Don't look at me.

07:45.199 --> 07:46.160
Hey.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
Hey, it's all right.

07:52.240 --> 07:53.199
It's all right.

07:54.079 --> 07:55.000
I'm here.

07:56.399 --> 07:57.360
I'm here.

08:03.560 --> 08:04.519
It's all right.

08:08.720 --> 08:09.680
How are you feeling?

08:12.279 --> 08:13.199
I am...

08:15.600 --> 08:16.639
A little dizzy.

08:19.240 --> 08:20.439
You just need to rest.

08:28.319 --> 08:29.240
Be careful.

08:33.519 --> 08:34.519
How close was it?

08:36.360 --> 08:37.480
Your pulse was gone.

08:39.039 --> 08:40.200
But Alec brought you back.

08:41.399 --> 08:42.759
You're going to be all right.

08:50.559 --> 08:51.519
Hey.

08:52.240 --> 08:53.200
Hey.

08:56.480 --> 08:57.879
- Hi.
- How you doing?

08:57.960 --> 08:59.080
- Yeah.
- You all right?

09:00.399 --> 09:01.320
Better.

09:04.279 --> 09:05.799
- Did you tell her?
- No.

09:07.960 --> 09:09.000
We found a DNA match.

09:41.919 --> 09:42.840
So what do you want?

09:45.600 --> 09:46.720
My brother is innocent.

09:48.120 --> 09:49.320
I promise you.

09:50.960 --> 09:54.840
One of you Einsteins must have manipulated
the DNA test in order to frame him.

09:56.679 --> 09:59.480
- Why destroy the equipment then?
- How the fuck should I know?

09:59.879 --> 10:02.360
Maybe because it looks like
something Charlie would do.

10:04.399 --> 10:05.440
So who could it be?

10:08.679 --> 10:09.679
I don't know.

10:09.759 --> 10:11.480
You gotta do better than that, Amy.

10:13.320 --> 10:16.240
The other day, when you made
that phone call from the sat-phone,

10:17.200 --> 10:18.799
you said you were calling home.

10:20.279 --> 10:21.360
I checked the number.

10:22.559 --> 10:23.519
Qatar?

10:26.080 --> 10:27.879
Look, I have nothing to do
with the murders.

10:27.960 --> 10:29.240
Well, neither does my brother.

10:31.039 --> 10:34.039
You better find me something
I can use to get him off the hook,

10:34.679 --> 10:36.759
otherwise
I 'm gonna have to go talk to Alec.

10:37.200 --> 10:39.480
- Oscar...
- Listen to me. You have until sunset.

10:40.240 --> 10:41.440
I'll meet you right here.

10:46.799 --> 10:47.720
Fine...

10:57.440 --> 10:59.840
My name is Margaret Emilia Mitchell.

11:00.360 --> 11:02.919
You were a member of the Polaris VI crew,
weren't you?

11:03.799 --> 11:07.320
<i>Yes. I was the doctor appointed to be</i>
<i>at the base for the winter.</i>

11:14.679 --> 11:15.720
Have a look.

11:19.440 --> 11:20.440
Can you crack it?

11:21.039 --> 11:22.519
Yeah, I can try.

11:22.600 --> 11:23.639
The sooner the better.

11:25.279 --> 11:26.519
No news from Icegirl?

11:27.679 --> 11:28.600
Nope.

11:31.399 --> 11:32.480
Keep me posted.

11:33.200 --> 11:34.120
Aye, aye, sir.

12:08.679 --> 12:09.679
He was compulsive.

12:11.120 --> 12:13.159
He told me he had
over 600 of those back home.

12:14.200 --> 12:16.000
This one was completed over a week ago.

12:16.960 --> 12:17.960
The rest are all prior.

12:19.279 --> 12:20.840
But where was the last one he was using?

12:21.480 --> 12:22.600
Why?

12:22.679 --> 12:24.759
Because it's missing, that's why.

12:36.159 --> 12:37.080
Hey.

12:39.039 --> 12:40.240
Can you keep a secret?

12:42.679 --> 12:44.000
Remember the Polaris case?

12:44.480 --> 12:45.440
Maggie Mitchell?

12:46.080 --> 12:47.200
Yeah, of course.

12:47.279 --> 12:50.840
Her real name is Olivia Jackson,
daughter of Sarah Jackson,

12:50.919 --> 12:52.200
who died in Polaris V.

12:54.360 --> 12:55.279
What?

12:57.200 --> 12:58.120
See.

12:59.279 --> 13:00.240
Are you serious?

13:04.360 --> 13:05.360
Wait...

13:06.919 --> 13:07.840
Who's that?

13:09.039 --> 13:11.039
That's... Sylvia.

13:12.440 --> 13:13.399
Maggie's sister.

14:16.720 --> 14:17.720
Thank you, Syl.

14:22.320 --> 14:24.120
Do you remember
the last time we were here?

14:26.480 --> 14:29.679
We were with Mom,
you must've been about, I dunno, five?

14:30.440 --> 14:32.519
And you went mental
because I broke your CD player.

14:32.600 --> 14:34.559
Yeah, I wanted to kill you.

14:39.080 --> 14:40.000
Here.

14:41.840 --> 14:42.840
Look at this.

14:45.759 --> 14:46.720
Lou Kowalski.

14:48.480 --> 14:49.600
It's from his Instagram.

14:52.600 --> 14:53.559
Who's that?

14:54.799 --> 14:55.919
Rachel Russo.

14:57.519 --> 14:58.480
Arthur's daughter.

14:59.960 --> 15:00.919
Yeah.

15:02.080 --> 15:04.120
She's an amazing marine biologist too.

15:04.759 --> 15:05.720
Trinity College.

15:06.120 --> 15:08.960
I tried to get in touch with her
at her lab but...

15:10.519 --> 15:11.440
guess what.

15:12.840 --> 15:14.159
She left nine weeks ago.

15:14.679 --> 15:15.600
Exactly.

15:17.679 --> 15:19.200
She must be a part of Arthur's team.

15:21.320 --> 15:23.440
I just don't understand
why we can't trace them.

15:25.200 --> 15:26.639
I have her last known address.

15:28.559 --> 15:29.639
Sandyford...

15:29.720 --> 15:31.440
it's only a couple of hours away
from here.

15:32.039 --> 15:32.960
Ok.

17:03.200 --> 17:05.319
It's ok.

17:05.400 --> 17:06.359
I don't want to...

17:09.200 --> 17:10.759
I'm here. I've got you.

17:13.359 --> 17:14.759
Look at me, hi.

17:15.839 --> 17:16.960
Hi.

17:17.039 --> 17:18.000
Ok?

17:20.720 --> 17:21.759
Syl.

17:24.319 --> 17:25.359
Sylvia.

17:27.880 --> 17:28.920
Syl!

18:08.319 --> 18:09.400
Is it worth it?

18:14.759 --> 18:15.880
Was any of it?

18:18.680 --> 18:19.920
You don't understand.

18:20.839 --> 18:21.920
I don't.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.480
Killing Arthur will not bring her back.

18:25.359 --> 18:26.400
Or your mother.

18:27.680 --> 18:29.240
That's why I didn't kill him.

18:31.319 --> 18:32.799
I wanted him to suffer.

18:35.359 --> 18:38.720
That isn't working either, is it?

18:40.480 --> 18:41.400
I'm not done yet.

18:44.200 --> 18:45.920
I will find Arthur...

18:48.039 --> 18:49.039
and his daughter.

18:50.519 --> 18:51.599
And then what?

19:27.400 --> 19:29.839
Ok, I get it.

19:31.400 --> 19:34.359
But even if Maggie Mitchell
killed everyone in Antarctica,

19:35.359 --> 19:37.000
she's not on this ship, is she?

19:37.079 --> 19:39.799
Yeah, but it must all be related,
don't you think?

19:40.680 --> 19:41.880
I'm not so sure.

19:42.559 --> 19:45.279
Usually, the best explanation
is the simpliest one.

19:45.359 --> 19:46.839
There's nothing simple here.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
There is.

19:50.200 --> 19:53.640
Do you realize just how much
our research is worth?

19:55.640 --> 19:57.640
Someone's trying to steal it?

20:00.000 --> 20:01.720
OK. Here we go.

20:02.079 --> 20:04.440
Let's hope Kowalski
didn't choose a long password.

20:04.519 --> 20:06.000
Trial an error? Really?

20:06.640 --> 20:08.200
Yeah. We got some muscle here.

20:09.920 --> 20:11.559
But yeah. Fingers crossed.

21:20.359 --> 21:21.400
Hello.

21:22.839 --> 21:24.599
Hello. Hello!

21:26.839 --> 21:27.960
Is anybody there?

21:30.720 --> 21:31.839
Is anybody there?

21:33.599 --> 21:34.640
Hello?

21:42.599 --> 21:43.680
Hello.

21:45.519 --> 21:46.680
Oscar!

21:46.759 --> 21:47.920
Oscar, come here!

21:48.000 --> 21:49.799
Come here, Oscar!

21:49.880 --> 21:51.400
Oscar, Oscar!

21:51.480 --> 21:53.880
Oscar!

21:53.960 --> 21:55.960
Oscar!

21:56.559 --> 21:58.200
Come here!

21:58.880 --> 22:03.000
Where are you?

22:03.079 --> 22:05.000
Oscar!

22:05.079 --> 22:06.640
Come here, Oscar!

22:09.119 --> 22:10.920
Oscar!

22:14.799 --> 22:16.640
Where are you?

22:18.599 --> 22:22.079
- Oscar, where are you?
- Here! Here, Charlie!

22:23.119 --> 22:24.640
Charlie, I'm here. It's ok.

22:26.400 --> 22:27.400
Oscar...

22:30.960 --> 22:33.720
Open the door. I want to come out.

22:36.720 --> 22:37.839
I can't, Charlie.

22:38.480 --> 22:39.559
They won't let me.

22:40.279 --> 22:43.039
So you have to be very calm and wait.

22:43.119 --> 22:44.160
- Ok?
- No...

22:44.519 --> 22:45.440
No...

22:45.880 --> 22:47.039
I don't want to wait.

22:47.960 --> 22:50.119
- I want to come out.
- I know, bro, I know.

22:51.079 --> 22:52.240
But it's not that easy.

22:52.920 --> 22:55.000
Yes! It is that easy!

22:55.319 --> 22:58.319
Open the door and I come out.
And that's it.

22:59.079 --> 23:00.160
Where's Blanda?

23:01.440 --> 23:05.039
I don't know, but I'm going to find her
and bring her to you.

23:05.799 --> 23:09.599
But you have to promise me
you'll be much calmer.

23:09.680 --> 23:11.240
- I haven't...
- Ok?

23:11.319 --> 23:12.599
I haven't done anything.

23:12.680 --> 23:14.599
Why have you locked me up?

23:14.680 --> 23:15.920
I haven't done anything.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.480
I know you haven't, bro.

23:18.079 --> 23:20.119
I know, that's why everything will be ok.

23:20.200 --> 23:22.319
I swear, ok?

23:23.680 --> 23:24.599
No!

23:25.279 --> 23:28.519
No! Get me out of here!

23:28.960 --> 23:31.920
Get me out of here, Oscar!

23:34.279 --> 23:38.680
Oscar!

23:39.599 --> 23:41.599
Oscar, come here!

23:41.680 --> 23:42.880
Please, Oscar!

23:42.960 --> 23:44.880
Get me out!

23:45.200 --> 23:47.519
I want to come out!

23:47.599 --> 23:50.039
Oscar, Oscar!

23:50.119 --> 23:52.440
Oscar! Get me out!

23:52.799 --> 23:54.640
Get me out!

23:54.720 --> 23:55.680
Oscar!

23:58.920 --> 23:59.880
What is it?

24:01.680 --> 24:03.200
Why would Charlie want to kill me?

24:04.359 --> 24:05.400
Or Kowalski?

24:05.839 --> 24:09.319
And not to mention cutting off his head.
It just doesn't add up.

24:10.640 --> 24:11.880
Who said he's on his own?

24:12.920 --> 24:14.079
What if someone is using him?

24:17.599 --> 24:18.920
Only three days to go.

24:20.880 --> 24:21.880
He'll be fine.

24:23.680 --> 24:25.640
Yeah. Will we?

24:27.240 --> 24:28.160
Trust me.

24:29.559 --> 24:30.480
I might.

24:32.880 --> 24:34.319
Thank you for saving my life.

24:38.680 --> 24:39.680
It's all right.

24:41.920 --> 24:42.880
What?

24:45.200 --> 24:46.359
It was scary.

24:49.720 --> 24:51.559
It's not the first time I tried CPR.

24:54.359 --> 24:55.400
Didn't work then.

24:56.720 --> 24:57.680
Afghanistan?

25:00.599 --> 25:01.599
Yeah.

25:04.880 --> 25:07.400
You know how it feels
to take another man's life, don't you?

25:09.319 --> 25:10.319
I do.

25:11.920 --> 25:12.960
Ok.

25:14.119 --> 25:17.319
Well, now you know
how it feels to give one back.

25:31.960 --> 25:32.920
It's over.

25:36.559 --> 25:38.119
We lost some during the blackout.

25:39.480 --> 25:40.519
How much?

25:41.279 --> 25:42.440
12%.

25:43.079 --> 25:44.599
Just 98 minutes.

25:51.720 --> 25:53.039
Darkness kills it.

25:53.839 --> 25:55.319
That's what darkness does.

26:01.359 --> 26:03.440
But that's not what's bothering you,
is it?

26:08.400 --> 26:10.240
All these containers we're carrying...

26:12.519 --> 26:13.960
Are you sure they're empty?

26:14.839 --> 26:16.079
As far as I know, yes.

26:25.480 --> 26:26.480
Oscar...

26:26.880 --> 26:27.960
What about him?

26:31.200 --> 26:33.480
I saw him sneak out of the cargo bay.

26:33.559 --> 26:35.519
And then,
when he realized that I'd seen him,

26:35.599 --> 26:38.039
he told me
that I shouldn't wander around the ship.

26:40.680 --> 26:42.200
And it sounded like a threat.

26:49.359 --> 26:50.880
I think he's hiding something.

26:54.359 --> 26:59.200
My biggest success in life is
that I've been able to do what I do,

26:59.720 --> 27:01.039
to be free doing it,

27:01.640 --> 27:03.359
to make a buck or two

27:04.200 --> 27:06.240
and to be a father for Charlie,

27:06.319 --> 27:08.319
like our father was not for us.

27:09.519 --> 27:11.000
I don't like fear.

27:12.400 --> 27:13.400
And when I...

27:14.240 --> 27:16.960
When I feel that, my brother is with me.

27:18.160 --> 27:19.880
And he always helps me.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.119
See? They're all empty.

27:35.920 --> 27:37.000
Check them all.

27:38.359 --> 27:40.119
Every single bloody one.

27:40.200 --> 27:41.240
We'll do.

27:43.880 --> 27:45.079
What are we looking for?

27:48.039 --> 27:49.200
Are you 100% sure

27:49.279 --> 27:50.960
- you saw Oscar come this way?
- Yes.

27:58.319 --> 28:00.079
The man rolls his cigarettes, doesn't he?

28:07.359 --> 28:08.319
This one.

28:41.759 --> 28:42.720
Bastard.

29:08.079 --> 29:09.240
What the fuck is this?

29:09.319 --> 29:10.720
I've never seen one before.

29:13.440 --> 29:15.240
Fucking bastards...

29:17.480 --> 29:18.559
What is it?

29:18.640 --> 29:20.319
It's a portable PBR, like...

29:20.839 --> 29:22.160
but battery operated,

29:22.240 --> 29:24.160
designed to transport
living algae samples.

29:24.240 --> 29:26.400
Motherfucking bastards!

29:49.279 --> 29:53.279
Someone is trying to steal my research!

29:54.720 --> 29:58.720
And someone has smuggled this
onto the ship!

29:59.119 --> 30:00.960
On your fucking watch!

30:01.039 --> 30:02.119
I understand...

30:02.200 --> 30:03.240
Do you?!

30:05.079 --> 30:09.160
Maybe if you'd spent less time
fucking around on my daughter,

30:09.240 --> 30:10.960
you'd have kept your eye on the ball.

31:25.319 --> 31:26.240
Blanda?

31:27.839 --> 31:28.920
Blanda!

31:30.200 --> 31:34.519
We found a second PBR
in one of the containers on main deck.

31:35.759 --> 31:37.279
How did that get on my ship?

31:37.359 --> 31:40.880
I don't know. But Oscar is Chief Engineer,
he's got nothing to do with the cargo.

31:40.960 --> 31:42.319
And who's in charge of that?

31:43.279 --> 31:45.319
I am. And I had no idea.

31:49.640 --> 31:50.720
We're losing power.

32:06.759 --> 32:08.839
Oscar! Come on, Oscar! Pick it up!

32:09.160 --> 32:10.720
We've lost the main engine, sir,

32:10.799 --> 32:12.920
the emergency generator
will be on straight away.

32:15.400 --> 32:16.480
Oscar!

32:18.200 --> 32:19.240
Oscar!

32:24.640 --> 32:25.720
Yes.

32:25.799 --> 32:27.160
What the fuck is going on?

32:28.480 --> 32:29.680
The engine is down, sir.

32:30.160 --> 32:31.279
I know it is! Why?

32:32.359 --> 32:33.680
I've stopped it, that's why.

32:46.160 --> 32:47.240
Hello?

32:51.480 --> 32:52.400
Charlie?

32:55.519 --> 32:56.519
They let you out?

33:10.839 --> 33:12.039
Get it back on, now!

33:13.240 --> 33:14.720
With all due respect, sir,

33:15.480 --> 33:18.119
I'm not gonna do such a thing
until you release my brother.

33:20.559 --> 33:22.640
We found what you hid
in one of the containers,

33:22.720 --> 33:25.039
you piece of scum!
Who are you working for?

33:25.799 --> 33:26.920
What?

33:27.000 --> 33:29.160
You got your brother to kill Kowalski,
didn't you?

33:30.160 --> 33:31.240
I did not!

33:31.720 --> 33:33.960
And listen to me, you crazy bastard,

33:34.039 --> 33:36.519
me and my brother
had nothing to do with it, all right?

33:37.000 --> 33:38.480
- Charlie is out.
- What?

33:38.559 --> 33:39.960
He's out.

33:40.039 --> 33:41.680
He's out, he's escaped from his room.

33:55.119 --> 33:56.519
Stay here, ok?

34:00.519 --> 34:01.559
What was that?

34:03.079 --> 34:04.079
Nothing.

34:05.160 --> 34:06.079
Be careful.

34:06.480 --> 34:07.440
Yeah.

34:11.639 --> 34:13.119
Hey. What's going on?

34:13.199 --> 34:14.599
That Charlie has gone berserk...

34:14.679 --> 34:15.800
- What?
- What?

34:16.159 --> 34:17.360
Why has the ship stopped?

34:17.440 --> 34:18.719
It's fine, Alec's sorting it.

34:18.800 --> 34:19.840
What happened?

34:19.920 --> 34:21.679
Charlie's out, he escaped somehow.

34:21.760 --> 34:24.480
- You saw him?
- Yeah. He didn't even recognize me.

34:24.960 --> 34:26.480
It's like he snapped or something.

34:26.559 --> 34:27.800
You all right?

34:27.880 --> 34:28.840
Yeah.

34:46.079 --> 34:47.239
What's going on?

34:47.320 --> 34:48.599
Oscar stopped the engine

34:48.960 --> 34:50.599
and Charlie's escaped.

34:50.679 --> 34:51.679
Are we adrift?

34:52.639 --> 34:53.920
And a storm is coming.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.280
Look what you've done! Are you happy now?

34:58.960 --> 35:00.039
Where's Renaud?

35:00.119 --> 35:01.239
Looking for Charlie.

35:01.320 --> 35:03.760
<i>We are on level 2.</i>
<i>We are stucked in this level.</i>

35:05.440 --> 35:06.480
We? Who's we?

35:07.159 --> 35:08.800
Captain, what are you doing?

35:09.119 --> 35:10.280
I'm getting Charlie.

35:10.840 --> 35:12.199
Oscar is with me.

35:12.920 --> 35:14.119
The fucking saboteur?

35:14.519 --> 35:15.800
I know exactly where he is

35:15.880 --> 35:18.599
and I'm gonna try to convince him
to turn himself in, ok?

35:19.039 --> 35:22.519
<i>Oscar will get the engine back on</i>
<i>when Charlie is under control.</i>

35:22.599 --> 35:23.679
Like hell he will!

35:23.760 --> 35:24.719
Listen to me, pal.

35:25.280 --> 35:26.880
My brother can fucking lose it

35:26.960 --> 35:29.079
when he feels threatened
or scared and trust me,

35:29.159 --> 35:31.280
you don't wanna see him like that. Ok?

35:31.719 --> 35:34.320
At this point I'm the only one
who can talk to him, get it?

35:34.400 --> 35:36.760
Renaud, listen to me.
Come back to the bridge.

35:36.840 --> 35:38.320
It's our only chance.

35:40.840 --> 35:42.199
Trust me on this one.

35:42.280 --> 35:43.239
Renaud!

35:43.880 --> 35:44.800
Renaud!

35:45.320 --> 35:46.239
Renaud!

35:47.199 --> 35:48.159
Thank you, Captain.

35:50.199 --> 35:52.920
Charlie! You have to come out!

35:53.639 --> 35:55.320
I can't fucking believe this!

35:57.079 --> 35:58.880
The light in the PBR is not working.

35:59.199 --> 36:00.360
What does that mean?

36:00.440 --> 36:01.840
My algae are dying!

36:01.920 --> 36:04.079
Ergo, we lose everything.

36:04.159 --> 36:05.400
That's what it means!

36:06.000 --> 36:07.880
The emergency generator
is not wired for that.

36:09.559 --> 36:10.679
Well, fix it!

36:11.920 --> 36:13.400
That would be Oscar's job.

36:15.280 --> 36:16.239
Or Charlie's.

36:22.360 --> 36:23.440
Charlie!

36:25.239 --> 36:26.519
Charlie!

37:08.920 --> 37:10.079
Blanda...

37:13.199 --> 37:14.280
That's a trail.

37:25.039 --> 37:26.000
Charlie.

37:27.159 --> 37:29.840
Come on, bro.
Don't make this more difficult.

37:30.639 --> 37:32.800
Charlie, you need to come with us.

37:34.599 --> 37:35.559
Take the starboard.

38:07.840 --> 38:08.880
Char...!

38:24.000 --> 38:25.000
No...

38:48.239 --> 38:49.440
What have you done, son?

38:52.079 --> 38:53.079
Charlie!

39:09.519 --> 39:10.559
My biggest fear?

39:15.639 --> 39:18.840
That I die leaving Charlie by himself.
