Thrust into an epic legend
told by generations

00:18.350 --> 00:21.103
of oral storytellers like me.

Many versions of these

Legends of the Hidden Temple.

$25,000.

my temple to try.

Thanks. What's up with you,
Cristela?

I'm talking to a colossal head.
No offense.

Size isn't everything.

in history.

What legend are our heroes
living today?

01:29.756 --> 01:32.049
One of these four teams
of heroes has

the chance to enter your
temple to retrieve

01:46.563 --> 01:50.692
The Blue Barracudas,
nurses Megan and Rebecca.

01:50.734 --> 01:55.740
Or the Green Monkeys, roller
derby teammates Abby and Nikki.

01:56.615 --> 01:58.784
We don't necessarily
physically represent like

01:58.826 --> 02:02.079

Now we want focus.
We are roommates

CRISTELA:
Before we let our heroes loose

02:25.270 --> 02:29.231
to cross your moat, Olmec,
tell us more about the legend.

02:30.316 --> 02:35.697
This traditional Shinto story
is over 1,300 years old.

02:35.737 --> 02:38.908
Susanoo, the impetuous
young god of sea

02:38.949 --> 02:43.829
and storms doesn't really want
to be a god, so he acts out.

02:43.872 --> 02:46.707
And is banished from heaven
by his older sister

02:46.748 --> 02:48.710
for his bad attitude.

02:49.085 --> 02:51.336
On his way off the cloud,

02:51.378 --> 02:54.465
he grabbed supplies
to survive on Earth,

02:54.507 --> 02:57.050
including five bags of grains

02:57.093 --> 03:00.305
and his magical sword
of heaven.

03:00.346 --> 03:01.931
CRISTELA: Is this where
the sword breaks?

03:01.973 --> 03:03.515
Patience, Cristela.

03:03.557 --> 03:06.436
The sword will break
soon enough.

03:06.477 --> 03:09.104
On Earth, Susanoo realizes

03:09.146 --> 03:12.984
raw grains do not suffice
and grows hungry.

03:13.026 --> 03:16.153
He spots chopsticks floating
down the river

03:16.195 --> 03:19.490
and goes upstream in
search of food.

03:19.532 --> 03:23.118
What he finds changes
his life forever.

03:24.746 --> 03:27.039
We actually met on
a friendship app.

03:27.080 --> 03:28.457
We're both nurses,
so it worked out.

03:28.498 --> 03:29.959
Feel like nursing
makes us strong

03:30.001 --> 03:31.752
emotionally and physically.

03:31.794 --> 03:33.712
I am nervous for the moat.
I don't want to die.

03:33.754 --> 03:35.548
- I don't want to drown.
- I'll save you.

03:35.590 --> 03:37.091
Let's take it, let's take it.

03:37.133 --> 03:38.759
So Steven and I have
been friends

03:38.800 --> 03:40.719
for just about eight years.
We met in college

03:40.762 --> 03:42.597
-back in the day.
-We were in the same fraternity.

03:42.639 --> 03:44.557
Pretty much hit it off
instantaneously.

03:44.598 --> 03:47.352
Had the same kind of crazy
daredevil adventure spirit.

03:48.061 --> 03:50.271
CRISTELA: Our teams are
about to start a quest

03:50.312 --> 03:52.774
full of physical
and mental tests.

03:52.814 --> 03:56.485
To determine which team is
worthy of entering your temple.

03:56.526 --> 03:58.195
The first test
is crossing your moat.

03:58.237 --> 04:00.031
Olmec, how are we doing it
today?

04:00.073 --> 04:03.700
You are Susanoo
being cast out of heaven.

04:03.742 --> 04:06.829
At your feet are eight bags of
different grains.

04:06.871 --> 04:09.706
You need five of them
for your journey,

04:09.748 --> 04:12.543
but the list is on that
raft in the moat.

04:12.585 --> 04:14.419
On Cristela's signal,

04:14.461 --> 04:16.047
one of you head
out to the raft

04:16.088 --> 04:18.800
and swim it back towards
your teammate.

04:18.841 --> 04:21.593
Open the sack and call
for a grain.

04:21.636 --> 04:25.223
Your teammate must throw that
grain into your bag.

04:25.264 --> 04:27.809
Collect all five grains.

04:27.850 --> 04:31.396
Then both of you swim to those
chopsticks floating in the moat.

04:31.437 --> 04:34.189
Use them to repair
that broken raft,

04:34.231 --> 04:37.110
climb aboard it,
and paddle it to shore.

04:37.151 --> 04:39.237
Throw the chopsticks ashore

04:39.278 --> 04:41.738
and place at least one
piece of each of

04:41.781 --> 04:45.534
the five grains onto that
plate, proving your worth.

04:45.576 --> 04:47.786
Then you may hit your gong.

04:48.495 --> 04:51.374
The first three teams to
hit their gong continue

04:51.415 --> 04:56.211
on their quest.
The last team is out.

04:56.254 --> 04:58.255
We got this, baby,
we got this.

04:58.298 --> 04:59.798
- We're gonna be rowdy.
- Ambitious.

We're gonna be scaring
our competition.

Doing flips.
We're going to do it all.

- Go!
- Go Abby!

I'm going to swim my ass off.

05:30.120 --> 05:32.331
Within seconds, I'm back
at that line ready.

05:32.372 --> 05:34.959
I'm getting there. I'm trying to
open every sack possible.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.045
Tell me what you need.
Tell me what you need.

05:37.086 --> 05:38.838
CRISTELA: Looks like we have
some good swimmers.

05:38.879 --> 05:40.965
They have to get to
the raft and read

05:41.007 --> 05:42.966
the list of grains to
their teammate.

05:43.009 --> 05:45.011
They have to catch
at least one piece

05:45.052 --> 05:46.928
of the five grains
from the list.

05:46.971 --> 05:48.680
It's harder than it looks.

05:50.182 --> 05:52.185
By the time I was done

05:52.225 --> 05:54.519
opening each and every one
of them, Steve was there.

like, "Dude. Good to go."

05:57.481 --> 05:58.816
Like they're on it.

Let's go, Abby. Read it to me,
read it to me.

The Green Monkeys
have no grains yet,

06:04.613 --> 06:06.324
Blue Barracudas have one,

06:06.365 --> 06:09.076
Silver Snakes and Purple
Parrots have two each.

06:09.117 --> 06:11.579
This is how we should start
eating cereal in the morning.

06:11.620 --> 06:14.499
I just hold the bowl and
you just toss the oats to me.

06:14.540 --> 06:16.167
Yeah, yeah.

06:17.293 --> 06:19.420
- Got it?
- No.

06:19.461 --> 06:21.338
The Blue Barracudas
and the Green Monkeys

06:21.380 --> 06:23.007
are now trying to throw the
grains to each other.

06:24.257 --> 06:26.468
Yep, I got it.

06:26.511 --> 06:28.930
There's a lot of little pieces,
and, you know, in the beginning,

06:28.971 --> 06:31.391
if you get the wrong grain or
if it falls out of the bag

06:31.432 --> 06:33.475
or if something happens to it,
you're screwed.

06:33.518 --> 06:35.353
- Soybeans!
- Soybeans!

06:35.394 --> 06:37.146
Open the bag!

06:37.187 --> 06:38.898
Wasn't sure if I could swim
out there.

06:38.939 --> 06:41.067
It looked real steep
as it comes down that ramp.

06:41.108 --> 06:43.360
So I was like, "I'm really glad
I could toss the cups at you."

06:43.403 --> 06:45.196
Got it!

06:45.237 --> 06:47.031
When they're throwing the grain,
it almost looks

06:47.072 --> 06:49.199
like they're at a wedding
for no one.

06:49.242 --> 06:52.327
All right. He's got arms.
This guy could throw for miles,

06:53.745 --> 06:55.247
CRISTELA: Silver Snakes
were the first

06:55.288 --> 06:57.125
to get all five grains.

06:57.165 --> 06:59.000
Now they have to follow the
chopsticks upstream

06:59.043 --> 07:00.961
and use them to repair
the raft.

07:01.002 --> 07:02.922
Green Monkeys and Purple
Parrots are right behind them.

07:02.963 --> 07:05.550
Blue Barracudas need one more--
and they get it.

07:05.591 --> 07:07.509
So, all four teams are
at the same part of

07:07.552 --> 07:08.970
the challenge.
They're neck and neck.

07:09.011 --> 07:10.596
Remember there's four
teams out there.

07:10.637 --> 07:12.514
There's three spots for
the next round.

07:12.557 --> 07:14.641
Who is going to get it?
It's anybody's game right now.

07:14.684 --> 07:16.644
- You get the first two?
- Yeah.

07:17.228 --> 07:18.937
They have to put
the chopsticks on the raft

07:18.980 --> 07:21.481
to fix it. Then they
have to ride it to shore

07:21.524 --> 07:24.276
and dump the grain out to
show they have all five.

Wait, how does it work?

07:34.536 --> 07:36.538
Looking at this raft
like a puzzle.

07:36.581 --> 07:38.124
You've got to fit these pieces

07:38.165 --> 07:39.792
and we've got to slot
these nicely.

07:39.834 --> 07:41.252
The Green Monkeys are finally
catching up.

07:41.293 --> 07:43.795
All they have to do
is not be last.

07:47.507 --> 07:49.302
I see the Silver Snakes are
a little bit ahead.

07:49.343 --> 07:51.637

they're the jocks.

07:51.678 --> 07:53.889
They're swimming hard."

Went to school with these guys.
You like, throw me in a locker.

07:56.558 --> 07:58.560
There's no lockers on this
boat, so I'm not that worried.

08:00.980 --> 08:02.814
Okay, Silver Snakes have
a slight lead,

08:02.857 --> 08:04.192

coming in,

10:14.529 --> 10:16.197
And here come
the Green Monkeys.

10:17.658 --> 10:19.493
Blue Barracudas have
the right grains.

10:22.203 --> 10:24.831
Blue Barracudas are the second
team moving on.

10:24.874 --> 10:27.500
I feel amazing. Oh my gosh.
I feel like I'm cloud nine.

10:27.543 --> 10:31.297
Only one more team.
Green Monkeys or Purple Parrots.

10:31.338 --> 10:34.884
Yeah. Oh, oh!

10:35.091 --> 10:36.969
Oh!

10:37.010 --> 10:38.971
The Purple Parrots finally
hit their gong.

10:39.013 --> 10:41.432
They are the final team
moving on.

10:41.474 --> 10:43.017
I forget the gong.
It's the last thing,

10:43.058 --> 10:44.851
it's the exclamation
point.

10:44.894 --> 10:47.145
I want to be mad at you,
but I also forgot the gong.

10:47.187 --> 10:49.148
Well, Green Monkeys,
you did a great job.

10:49.190 --> 10:51.232
Unfortunately, you're
not moving forward,

10:51.274 --> 10:53.277
but you're not going
away empty handed.

10:53.318 --> 10:55.236
You get to keep your Green
Monkey T-shirts.

10:55.278 --> 10:56.739
Wear with pride.

10:56.780 --> 10:58.658
[cheering]

10:58.698 --> 11:01.284
Moving on to the next round
and one step closer

11:01.326 --> 11:05.873
to the temple run and $25,000
are the Purple Parrots,

11:05.914 --> 11:07.625
the Silver Snakes,

11:07.667 --> 11:10.418
and the Blue Barracudas!

11:10.461 --> 11:12.712
Next, we test how smart
they are

11:12.754 --> 11:15.383
in the Steps of Knowledge when
we come back. Stay tuned.

11:15.423 --> 11:18.802
Whoo! You guys made it,
you're doing it. Yes!

11:23.849 --> 11:25.684
Welcome back to
Legends of the Hidden Temple.

11:25.725 --> 11:27.436
How is everybody doing?

11:27.477 --> 11:31.231
- [cheering]
- Oh, yes. So, Silver Snakes,

11:31.273 --> 11:33.400
we just saw you dominate
the moat.

11:33.442 --> 11:35.403
How do you think you're going
to do in this level?

11:35.443 --> 11:37.822
We're feeling just as good as we
did at the start of that moat.

11:37.863 --> 11:39.490
I think this challenge
was made for us.

11:39.532 --> 11:41.283
We saw how fast you were
crossing the moat.

11:41.325 --> 11:44.703
Now let's see how smart you are.
Listen carefully

11:44.745 --> 11:46.996
as Olmec tells us more
of the legend.

11:48.581 --> 11:52.461
Susanoo travels upstream and
comes upon an old couple

11:52.503 --> 11:55.380
and their beautiful
daughter weeping.

11:55.423 --> 11:58.091
We had eight beautiful
daughters.

11:58.134 --> 12:03.304
the giant eight headed dragon,
Yamata no Orochi, ate one.

12:03.847 --> 12:07.143
He returns every year
to eat one more.

12:07.183 --> 12:10.855
Kushinadahime is our last.

12:10.895 --> 12:13.899
What does this dragon
look like?

12:13.941 --> 12:15.985
Eight heads and eight tails

12:16.025 --> 12:18.778
on a body that spans
eight mountains

12:18.821 --> 12:21.740
and eight valleys
with an underbelly

12:21.782 --> 12:24.909
that oozes pus and blood.

12:24.951 --> 12:27.163
I will kill that dragon

12:27.203 --> 12:30.666
if I can have your daughter's
hand in marriage.

12:30.707 --> 12:35.379
And he sets out to slay Orochi.
In a large field

12:35.421 --> 12:38.173
he builds a fence
with eight gates.

12:38.215 --> 12:41.719
Using his grains,
he makes fortified sake,

12:41.760 --> 12:46.182
places a vat of it behind each
gate and waits.

12:46.222 --> 12:49.809
Soon enough, the thirsty
dragon appears,

12:49.851 --> 12:52.562
making a beeline for Susanoo.

12:52.605 --> 12:56.442
Suddenly, all eight heads
stop mid-air

12:56.484 --> 12:58.943
and take a big whiff.

12:58.985 --> 13:01.238
[breathing in and out]

13:01.279 --> 13:03.990
Each massive head,
seeks its own vat

13:04.033 --> 13:08.120
and drinks greedily until
the dragon passes out,

13:08.162 --> 13:13.208
snoring so loudly, it awakens
the entire valley.

13:13.250 --> 13:16.253
Susanoo approaches
the drunk dragon.

13:16.294 --> 13:20.216
In a fury, he severs
all eight heads.

13:20.256 --> 13:22.217
The dragon heads grow back.

13:22.259 --> 13:24.302
So he starts on the tails.

13:24.345 --> 13:26.346
Suddenly, he hits something

13:26.388 --> 13:31.519
so hard that his unbreakable
sword of heaven snaps in two

13:31.559 --> 13:36.065
creating a broken sword
now residing in my temple.

13:36.105 --> 13:40.568
But what broke it?
An even stronger sword.

13:40.610 --> 13:46.075
The legendary Shinto relic
called the Grass Cutting sword.

13:46.115 --> 13:50.663
He pulls it from the blood
and pus and finishes the job.

13:50.703 --> 13:55.334
With the dragon dead
and a new sword at his side,

13:55.375 --> 13:59.922
Susanoo turns his attention
to his future bride.

13:59.963 --> 14:03.133
I'd say I see us as Susanoo.

14:03.174 --> 14:05.970
When he decides to help
the old couple out.

14:06.010 --> 14:07.638
He saves this family,
and I feel like

14:07.679 --> 14:09.431
that's kind of why
we went into nursing

14:09.472 --> 14:11.182
is because we wanted
to save people.

14:11.225 --> 14:14.019
You are at the Steps
of Knowledge.

14:14.061 --> 14:16.437
Olmec is about to ask
you questions from

14:16.480 --> 14:18.399
the legend you just heard.

14:18.440 --> 14:21.277
He'll also ask general
knowledge questions related

14:21.317 --> 14:25.322
to the story. Once he finishes
asking the questions,

14:25.364 --> 14:27.448
stomp on the ancient mark
in front of you.

14:27.490 --> 14:29.326
If correct, take a step down.

14:29.368 --> 14:32.203
If you're wrong or you take
too long to answer,

14:32.245 --> 14:34.248
the other teams have
a chance to answer.

14:34.289 --> 14:36.207
We rung the gong first
on the moat,

14:36.250 --> 14:38.418
I think the next thing you'll
see is us at the bottom

14:38.460 --> 14:40.169
- of the stairs first.
- Listen, purple, you think

14:40.211 --> 14:41.880
you're the nerds?
We're going to see

14:41.922 --> 14:43.631
who the real nerds are when we
get out there.

14:43.673 --> 14:45.592
So like, sure, the jocks

14:45.634 --> 14:48.511
got first place in the moat,
but like, that's a given.

14:48.553 --> 14:50.139
They can swim,
they got muscles.

14:50.179 --> 14:52.474
They got--
Oh yeah, with a good yeah.

14:52.515 --> 14:54.894
But like, come on, when it
comes to trivia knowledge like,

14:54.934 --> 14:56.644
we can do this.

14:56.687 --> 14:58.605
The first two teams
to come down,

14:58.647 --> 15:00.441
will move forward to
the Temple Games.

15:01.107 --> 15:04.903
Unfortunately, that means
the last team will be out.

15:05.988 --> 15:07.572
Is everybody ready to do this?

15:07.615 --> 15:09.198
- Let's go baby.
- Yeah!

15:09.240 --> 15:11.744
Sweet. Olmec,
first question, please.

15:13.703 --> 15:16.581
What is Susanoo the god of?

15:16.624 --> 15:18.250
[ringing in]

15:18.292 --> 15:20.668
- CRISTELA: Silver Snakes.
- The sea?

15:20.711 --> 15:22.421
That is correct.

15:22.462 --> 15:24.213
CRISTELA: Congratulations,
Silver Snakes,

15:24.255 --> 15:26.091
you take a step forward.
Off to a good start.

15:26.133 --> 15:29.720
- Olmec, next question.
- Which of these cities

15:29.761 --> 15:31.846
is the present day
capital of Japan?

15:31.889 --> 15:33.474
[ringing in]

15:33.514 --> 15:35.183
- CRISTELA: Blue Barracudas.
- Tokyo?

15:35.225 --> 15:37.394
That is correct.

15:37.436 --> 15:39.270
CRISTELA: Nice.
Blue Barracudas on the board.

15:39.312 --> 15:41.440
All right, Olmec. Next question.

15:41.856 --> 15:45.610
How many daughters has the
serpent already killed?

15:45.653 --> 15:47.363
CRISTELA: Silver Snakes.

15:47.403 --> 15:49.740
- Seven.
- That is correct.

15:50.157 --> 15:52.283
CRISTELA: Dang, Silver Snakes.

15:52.326 --> 15:54.577
You're in it to win it.
I see it. All right, Olmec.

15:54.620 --> 15:57.623
What is the name of the
terrifying serpent?

15:57.664 --> 15:59.540
- [ringing in]
- CRISTELA: Purple Parrots?

15:59.582 --> 16:01.710
- Orochi?
- That is correct.

16:01.751 --> 16:06.173
CRISTELA: Oh yeah. Orochi,
All righty then. I love it.

16:06.215 --> 16:08.509
Olmec, next question, please.

16:08.549 --> 16:12.388
What objects did Susanoo
follow to find the couple

16:12.428 --> 16:14.181
and their daughter?

16:14.222 --> 16:16.892
CRISTELA: Blue Barracudas.
The chopsticks?

16:16.933 --> 16:18.977
OLMEC: That is correct.

16:19.019 --> 16:21.480
Oh, right now I see the
Blue Barracudas

16:21.522 --> 16:24.482
and the Silver Snakes are tied.
Still Purple Parrots,

16:24.524 --> 16:28.070
it's anybody's game.
So, Olmec next question.

16:28.111 --> 16:30.405
OLMEC: What did Susanoo
want in exchange

16:30.447 --> 16:32.490
for saving Kushinadahime?

16:32.533 --> 16:34.868
[ringing in]

16:34.909 --> 16:36.912
- CRISTELA: Blue Barracudas?
- To marry Kushinadahime.

16:36.953 --> 16:38.788
That is correct.

16:38.831 --> 16:41.625
CRISTELA: Oh congratulations,
Blue Barracudas.

16:41.667 --> 16:44.128
You're the first team
to go to the next round.

16:44.168 --> 16:46.212
You will be competing
in the Temple Games.

16:46.254 --> 16:48.548
Oh, we're feeling amazing.

16:48.590 --> 16:50.426
That was the most
satisfying thing,

16:50.466 --> 16:52.552
I think has ever happened to me.

16:52.594 --> 16:55.596
Redemption, baby. Not only do
we get the redemption we wanted,

16:55.639 --> 16:58.475
but we're one step closer
to running Olmec's temple

16:58.517 --> 17:00.184
- and it feels great.
- Hell yeah.

17:00.226 --> 17:02.520
One spot left, two teams remain.

17:02.562 --> 17:07.026
Oh, the tension.
Olmec, next question.

17:07.067 --> 17:10.570
What are Japanese comic books
and graphic novels called?

17:10.612 --> 17:12.448
- [ringing in]
- CRISTELA: Purple Parrots?

17:12.489 --> 17:14.157
Manga?

17:14.199 --> 17:16.785
- That is correct.
- CRISTELA: Oh, man!

17:16.826 --> 17:18.494
My momma always like,
"You reading all these

17:18.537 --> 17:20.247
like anime, comic
books and manga?

17:20.288 --> 17:22.082
Like, That's not going
to help you in life."

17:22.124 --> 17:24.042
- Look at me now, Mom.
- CRISTELA: Purple Parrots,

17:24.084 --> 17:26.502
Silver Snakes, one step away.

17:26.545 --> 17:28.380
So we're at the final
question now, right?

17:28.422 --> 17:31.090
- One of us is going to go home.
- We're on our toes now.

17:31.133 --> 17:33.259
We're laser focused and we're
trying to get that last step.

17:33.301 --> 17:35.345
We are facing catastrophe.

17:35.386 --> 17:37.765
This would just demolish
our confidence for

17:37.806 --> 17:40.099
the rest of our lives
if we lose

17:40.142 --> 17:42.560
a trivia competition
to the jocks.

17:42.603 --> 17:45.314
CRISTELA: It's anybody's game.
Next question. Olmec.

17:45.355 --> 17:47.523
After drinking the sake,

17:47.566 --> 17:51.111
what did Yamata
No Orochi do so loud,

17:51.153 --> 17:53.029
the entire valley could hear it?

17:53.072 --> 17:54.865
Silver Snakes.

17:57.409 --> 17:58.826
Yawn!

17:59.118 --> 18:00.913
OLMEC: Incorrect

18:00.953 --> 18:02.998
- [ringing in]
- CRISTELA: Purple Parrots?

18:03.039 --> 18:04.875
Snore!

18:06.042 --> 18:07.920
That is correct.

18:07.961 --> 18:09.378
CRISTELA: Oh!

18:09.421 --> 18:11.423
Moving forward, Purple Parrots,

18:11.464 --> 18:13.467
you've secured your spot
in the Temple Games.

18:13.509 --> 18:15.844
- Congratulations.
- Whoo!

18:15.885 --> 18:19.347
I love to see it. Silver Snakes.

18:19.388 --> 18:21.474
You did a great job,
unfortunately,

18:21.517 --> 18:23.684
you are not moving forward.

18:23.727 --> 18:25.979
It stings. It stings more than
we thought it was going to.

18:26.020 --> 18:28.481
But you know, it's
a huge congrats

18:28.523 --> 18:31.234
to the Blue Barracudas
and the Purple Parrots.

18:31.276 --> 18:33.194
But you are not
leaving empty handed.

18:33.237 --> 18:35.239
Tell them what they won.

18:35.279 --> 18:36.865
ANNOUNCER: On top of
your Silver Snake shirts,

18:36.906 --> 18:38.575
you're going home
with a whole bunch

18:38.616 --> 18:40.952
of Legends of the Hidden Temple
signature swag.

18:41.244 --> 18:44.498
Including limited edition hats,
beach towels, sports chairs,

18:44.539 --> 18:47.084
spike ball sets and giant
Olmec party coolers

18:47.125 --> 18:49.502
- for each of you.
- We got the Blue Barracudas

18:49.545 --> 18:52.381
and the Purple Parrots. These
two teams are one step closer

18:52.422 --> 18:55.134
to racing through Olmec's temple
for $25,000.

18:55.174 --> 18:57.510
Stay tuned. Yes!

19:01.056 --> 19:03.933
[cheering]

19:03.976 --> 19:06.394
Welcome back to Legends
of the Hidden Temple.

19:06.435 --> 19:09.147
Now you've seen the heroes
cross Olmec's moat

19:09.189 --> 19:11.650
and make their way down
the Steps of Knowledge.

19:11.692 --> 19:14.443
Now, the only thing standing
between them

19:14.486 --> 19:17.614
and a shot at $25,000
are these Temple Games.

19:17.655 --> 19:19.740
Still with us, we got Megan
and Rebecca,

19:19.782 --> 19:21.367
- the Blue Barracudas.
- In nursing,

19:21.410 --> 19:23.537
we had a really hard
year in 2020.

19:23.578 --> 19:26.748
We overcame a lot of challenges
with COVID. We deserve a win.

19:26.789 --> 19:29.500
- CRISTELA: And Michael
and Augie, the Purple Parrots.

19:29.542 --> 19:32.421
Temple Games, last step
to that temple run.

19:32.461 --> 19:34.213
How do you thing we're gonna do?

19:34.256 --> 19:36.299
We're extremely strong.
We're extremely fast.

19:36.340 --> 19:38.885
- Bah bah bah bah bah. Victory.
- Yes.

19:38.926 --> 19:41.137
Both teams will be competing
for these little babies.

19:41.180 --> 19:44.016
The Pendants of Life. Oh!

19:44.807 --> 19:46.476
Now you will need them
to protect yourself

19:46.518 --> 19:48.228
from the dreaded temple guards

19:48.269 --> 19:50.063
as you make your way through
Olmec's temple.

19:50.105 --> 19:52.607
The first team to get two
Pendants of Life have proven

19:52.648 --> 19:56.361
themselves worthy and will be
allowed to enter Olmec's temple.

19:56.403 --> 19:59.740
So, the first temple game will
be played one team at a time.

19:59.780 --> 20:02.116
Blue Barracudas, you won
the Steps of Knowledge

20:02.159 --> 20:04.118
and you have chosen
to go second.

20:04.161 --> 20:05.828
When we watched the Purple
Parrots

20:05.871 --> 20:07.538
in the previous games,
we both picked up on,

20:07.580 --> 20:09.833
they miss the important
little steps.

20:09.875 --> 20:12.085
So we're going to watch
what they miss

20:12.126 --> 20:13.753
and use that to our advantage.

20:13.795 --> 20:15.756
So teams, go ahead
and get ready.

20:16.589 --> 20:21.094
As Olmec tells us more about
temple game number one.

20:21.135 --> 20:24.640
Susanoo weakened Orochi
by getting it drunk

20:24.681 --> 20:27.558
on fortified sake.
In this game,

20:27.601 --> 20:31.395
you are Susanoo,
making the sake.

20:31.438 --> 20:33.815
When Cristela gives
the signal,

20:33.856 --> 20:36.777
one team mate must memorize
one of five ingredients

20:36.817 --> 20:39.654
listed on the sake mat,
climb the mountain

20:39.695 --> 20:42.950
and shout that ingredient
to your partner,

20:42.990 --> 20:45.243
who must grab the ingredient
from the pantry

20:45.285 --> 20:47.412
and launch it to you,

20:47.453 --> 20:51.124
using that slinging device.
Catch the ingredient,

20:51.165 --> 20:55.127
slide down the mountain
and throw it in the vat.

20:55.170 --> 20:59.674
Repeat until you have all
five ingredients in the vat.

20:59.715 --> 21:03.261
When you are done,
grab those two sake cups

21:03.303 --> 21:07.766
and raise a toast by dumping
them on each other.

21:07.807 --> 21:12.436
Then you may run over and hit
your gong to stop the clock.

21:12.479 --> 21:17.358
The team that makes the sake
fastest wins. Kanpai!

21:17.401 --> 21:20.487
All right, teams, get ready.

21:20.528 --> 21:24.240

is Koji.

up that mountain.

that mountain.

connection for Myke and Auggie.

just so much bigger now.

of our worries.

they're going to make

22:27.846 --> 22:29.263
those little mistakes,
and that's where

22:29.306 --> 22:30.640

advantage.

in his little area,

are hard to catch.

22:58.542 --> 23:00.961
I think we do have an
advantage being nurses.

We're used to working
in fast paced,

23:03.589 --> 23:05.634

and staying calm.

CRISTELA: That's number four.

to finish the sake but--

the Pendant of Life. Oh, it's
still anybody's game, though.

Let's see if they can do it.
Blue Barracudas, get ready.

23:52.471 --> 23:55.099
Having a clock time us is
kind of nerve-wracking.

You know, there is a little
bit of anxiety

23:56.809 --> 23:58.603

31:21.628 --> 31:23.213
Two Pendants of Life.

31:23.256 --> 31:26.174
- Make them kiss.
[laughter]

31:26.217 --> 31:30.637
That means that you are moving
on to run Olmec's temple.

31:30.680 --> 31:33.016
- How are you feeling right now?
- Exuber-tant.

31:33.057 --> 31:35.768
- Yes.
-We are going to Olmec's temple.

31:35.809 --> 31:38.313
Yes! We did it!

31:38.354 --> 31:40.981
Oh, I knew it
was going to happen.

31:41.023 --> 31:45.528
Unfortunately, Blue Barracudas,
I'm so sorry to see you go.

31:45.569 --> 31:47.447
When you look back at everything
that you've accomplished,

31:47.488 --> 31:49.574
you should be proud of
everything that you've done

31:49.615 --> 31:51.910
and don't stay down, get
back up and just keep going.

31:51.951 --> 31:54.621
Blue Barracudas, you are not
going away empty handed.

31:54.662 --> 31:56.830
ANNOUNCER: You've each won
an electric scooter from Razor!

31:56.873 --> 31:58.458
- Yes!
-ANNOUNCER: It's the eco-smart

31:58.499 --> 32:00.542
SUP electric scooter.

32:00.585 --> 32:03.337
A quiet ride with a wide
bamboo deck, twist grip

32:03.378 --> 32:05.381
throttle, and pneumatic
tire tubes.

32:05.423 --> 32:07.842
Goes up to 12 miles
on a single charge.

32:08.300 --> 32:11.637
Augie and Myke have earned the
right to enter Olmec's temple

32:11.679 --> 32:14.097
to retrieve the broken
Sword of Heaven of Susanoo

32:14.140 --> 32:17.309
and the shot at $25,000.

32:17.352 --> 32:18.810
When we come back.

32:23.191 --> 32:25.233
[cheering]

32:25.276 --> 32:27.737
Welcome back to
Legends of the Hidden Temple.

32:27.778 --> 32:29.655
Myke in Augie have earned

32:29.696 --> 32:31.574
the right to enter
Olmec's temple.

32:31.615 --> 32:33.576
But before we let them
loose to retrieve

32:33.617 --> 32:36.578
the broken Sword of Heaven
of Susanoo, Olmec?

32:38.080 --> 32:40.165
Can you tell us the
end of the story?

32:40.833 --> 32:45.128
After defeating Orochi,
Susanoo marries Kushinadahime.

32:45.755 --> 32:47.798
He takes his new
Grass Cutting sword

32:47.839 --> 32:51.802
to heaven and offers
it to his sister, Amaterasu,

32:51.844 --> 32:53.887
as a sort of peace offering
before returning to Earth

32:53.930 --> 32:57.517
and living
happily ever after.

32:57.557 --> 33:00.686
CRISTELA: Olmec, where is
the sword of Susanoo?

33:00.728 --> 33:02.814
OLMEC: The broken sword
of heaven of Susanoo

33:02.855 --> 33:07.567
may be found in
the Shrine of the Silver Monkey.

33:07.609 --> 33:10.570
So the strategy today is
Augie's gonna go first probably

33:10.613 --> 33:13.281
because
he's, like, the puzzle guy.

33:13.324 --> 33:15.076
I'm gonna give him a chance
to get through there,

33:15.117 --> 33:18.162
figure things out, and I'm just
gonna zoom through that mug.

33:18.203 --> 33:19.454
CRISTELA: There are
many challenges and locked doors

33:19.497 --> 33:21.540
in Olmec's temple
that stand between you

33:21.582 --> 33:23.835
and the broken sword of heaven.

33:23.875 --> 33:26.211
Before you enter,
Olmec has some information

33:26.253 --> 33:28.881
that will help you make your way
through the temple. Olmec?

33:28.923 --> 33:33.385
OLMEC: Your temple run to
the Shrine of the Silver Monkey

33:33.427 --> 33:35.762
begins in the Crystal Cenote,

33:35.805 --> 33:39.182
where only one
of three doors opens.

33:39.224 --> 33:42.854
It could be the high road
to the Royal Rage Room.

33:42.894 --> 33:45.397
Release your rage
on those clay pots

33:45.440 --> 33:47.482
to find three jade keys

33:47.525 --> 33:50.944
that unlock the king's coffer
and could open the door

33:50.987 --> 33:54.031
to the Room of the Beloved.

33:54.073 --> 33:57.535
Maneuver the ancient skull
through the maze,

33:57.576 --> 34:01.748
reuniting it with its skeleton
to gain entrance directly

34:01.788 --> 34:06.711
to the shrine of the Silver
Monkey, and the broken sword,

34:06.752 --> 34:11.173
or open the gate into the
Spider's Lair.

34:11.215 --> 34:12.967
Avoid the deadly spiders
as you look

34:13.009 --> 34:16.304
for one of two open doors
that may lead you

34:16.344 --> 34:19.556
to the Pit of Despair,

34:19.599 --> 34:24.144
where you may choose to climb
the bony walls or crawl across

34:24.186 --> 34:28.608
the rubble to the Dark Forest.
Race through the trees,

34:28.648 --> 34:31.985
smash the rock wall
and climb up

34:32.027 --> 34:35.822
the ladder of death
to the Queen's Armory.

34:35.864 --> 34:37.824
Dress the queen for battle,

34:37.867 --> 34:41.496
and she may open the gate
to the Steamy Hollows

34:41.536 --> 34:44.664
where you must
match the blasts of steam

34:44.706 --> 34:49.378
or climb the stairs to the
Room of the Lost Treasure.

34:50.003 --> 34:53.465
Remove the rods to drop
refuse on the floor

34:53.507 --> 34:56.885
and find the lost jade stone
wrapped in fur.

34:56.927 --> 34:58.846
Return it to its pedestal

34:58.887 --> 35:01.641
to finally open the gate
to the shrine

35:01.681 --> 35:04.101
of the Silver Monkey.

35:04.143 --> 35:07.771
Grab the broken Sword of Heaven
of Susanoo before time is up

35:07.813 --> 35:10.733
and all the doors will
instantly unlock.

35:10.775 --> 35:13.235
Race back through
the Crystal Cenote

35:13.277 --> 35:15.112
and through the temple gates.

35:15.153 --> 35:17.532
The choices are yours

35:17.572 --> 35:21.952
and yours alone.
Who is going first?

35:22.327 --> 35:26.498
- I am!
- OLMEC: Very well, Augie.

35:27.125 --> 35:28.668
We showed a lot of
perseverance, overcoming

35:28.708 --> 35:30.710
a lot of mistakes we made.

35:30.753 --> 35:32.963
Yeah, we're very proud of our
accomplishments so far.

35:33.005 --> 35:35.257
Open to add to that today,

35:35.298 --> 35:37.844
- with Olmec's temple.
- Hiding inside the temple

35:37.885 --> 35:39.469
are three temple guards...

35:39.512 --> 35:41.304
[screaming]

35:41.347 --> 35:44.432
...assigned to protect three
specific rooms.

35:44.474 --> 35:47.769
Hand one of them
your pendants as an extra life,

35:47.811 --> 35:50.815
and you may go on.
But get caught without

35:50.856 --> 35:54.068
a pendant, you'll be taken
out of the temple

35:54.110 --> 35:58.280
and it will be Myke's turn to
enter and try his luck.

35:58.322 --> 36:00.365
If you can reach the broken
Sword of Heaven,

36:00.407 --> 36:02.702
the temple guards will vanish.

36:02.742 --> 36:06.746
Return through the gates with
the sword in four minutes

36:06.789 --> 36:09.708
and you will both be handsomely
rewarded.

36:09.750 --> 36:12.335
And here's how.

36:12.378 --> 36:14.380

- All right.

36:51.416 --> 36:54.253
Augie, get into position,
put four minutes on the clock.

36:54.295 --> 36:57.005
Olmec, open your gate.

36:57.047 --> 37:00.175
[low rumbling]

37:00.217 --> 37:04.639
All right, Augie,
on your mark, get set.

37:04.679 --> 37:07.349
Go! Come on, Augie.

37:07.391 --> 37:10.018
You got this, you got
this, Augie. All day.

37:10.061 --> 37:11.978
Augie is in the Crystal Cenote.

37:12.021 --> 37:13.898
One of these three
doors will open.

37:13.940 --> 37:15.815
He's climbing up to
the Spider's Lair.

37:15.858 --> 37:17.525
Nope, that door's locked.

37:17.568 --> 37:19.987
He's headed to the Crypt
of the Heartless.

37:21.530 --> 37:23.114
Also locked.

37:24.659 --> 37:26.744
You got no other choice.
You're doing good, Augie.

37:27.911 --> 37:29.579
[tense music]

37:29.621 --> 37:32.083
The Royal Rage room.
Aw! One of my faves.

37:34.710 --> 37:38.463
He has to smash the pots to find
three jade keys to open the door

37:38.505 --> 37:40.173
and go through
the Spider's Lair,

37:40.215 --> 37:41.967
or the Room of the
Beloved.

37:42.009 --> 37:44.679
Oh yes, break that!
Nice strategy,

37:44.719 --> 37:46.472
break them all at once.

37:46.514 --> 37:47.722
MYKE: You got the keys,
let's go.

37:47.764 --> 37:50.184
How many keys are there?

37:50.226 --> 37:52.519
Great job, you're doing great,
Augie.

37:54.230 --> 37:56.273
The door to the Room
of the Beloved is open.

37:56.315 --> 37:58.567
All right.

Give him your pendant!

38:15.876 --> 38:18.086
CRISTELA: Augie used his
Pendant of Life.

38:18.128 --> 38:20.130
Next temple guard,
and you're in Myke.

38:20.172 --> 38:21.882
He's one room away from the
sword of Susanoo

38:21.923 --> 38:24.385
with just under
three minutes left.

38:24.427 --> 38:26.637
He's got to reunite that

Oh, you got this all day.

MYKE: All right, yes!

38:40.735 --> 38:42.820
CRISTELA: No telling
where he will end up now.

38:42.862 --> 38:44.655
There are so many ways out.

He's in the Pit of Despair,
following the bony walls

38:54.789 --> 38:58.126
to the Queen's Armory.
That door is locked.

38:58.168 --> 38:59.878
Will he jump down?

39:01.088 --> 39:02.672
- Argh!
- CRISTELA: Nope.

39:04.132 --> 39:05.592
Augie's using a lot of time.

39:08.679 --> 39:11.056
Yes, the Dark Forest
is open,

39:11.097 --> 39:13.516

Go, Myke. Go into the temple!

39:22.568 --> 39:25.780
Myke has a minute and 44 seconds
to retrace Augie's path

39:25.820 --> 39:27.947
and then make his way to the
shrine of the Silver Monkey.

39:27.989 --> 39:29.367
He's through
the Crystal Cenote.

39:31.159 --> 39:33.204
Through the Royal Rage Room.

39:33.244 --> 39:35.956
Okay, going into the
Room of the Beloved. Come on.

39:39.293 --> 39:40.753
Into the Spider's Lair.

where Augie left off.
He's still got over a minute.

39:59.480 --> 40:01.315
He still has his Pendant
of Life.

Let's hope he doesn't run
into a temple guard.

This is the hardest room,
he needs to dress

the Queen with five pieces
of armor.

- 15 seconds!

Come on. You got 15 seconds,
rush it.

40:52.907 --> 40:55.577
- Come on. Let's do it.
- AUGIE: Press the gong.

40:55.619 --> 40:56.911
CRISTELA: He has to match
the steam blasts.

Five, four, three two, one.
Ugh!

ride all the way through.

41:12.135 --> 41:14.054
You know, we saw every
step of the way.

41:14.096 --> 41:15.931
And that says something.

41:15.972 --> 41:17.932
I made it in the temple
and that's enough for me.

41:17.974 --> 41:19.684
Yeah.

41:19.726 --> 41:21.603
CRISTELA: You had an
amazing journey.

41:21.644 --> 41:23.938
You almost forgot to hit
your gong in the moat.

41:23.981 --> 41:26.025
You beat the jocks at
the last minute

41:26.065 --> 41:28.027
on the Steps of Knowledge,

41:28.068 --> 41:30.403
you forced the tiebreaker
with a photo finish

41:30.445 --> 41:33.157
in the Temple Games.
Then you won it.

41:33.199 --> 41:35.617
You proved yourselves worthy of
entering Olmec's temple,

41:35.659 --> 41:39.121
walking away with $2,500.

41:39.163 --> 41:41.206
Never give up.
That's the lesson, kids.
