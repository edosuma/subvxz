00:01.800 --> 00:03.701
We have a very special
<i>tool time</i> today.

00:03.702 --> 00:06.871
Yeah, we do!
Making a rare tv appearance,

00:06.872 --> 00:09.840
One of the biggest superstars
we've had on this show.

00:09.841 --> 00:13.678
I want you to give
a warm <i>tool time</i> welcome to...

00:13.679 --> 00:16.847
A 1950 customized mercury.

00:16.848 --> 00:19.250
<i>(cheers and applause)</i>

00:20.420 --> 00:22.587
<i>(tim)</i> not bad, huh?

00:22.588 --> 00:25.490
Actually, this is not
our guest today.

00:25.491 --> 00:27.759
Our special guest is the man
that owns this car.

00:27.760 --> 00:29.928
Oh, him.
Yes.

00:29.929 --> 00:31.963
He happens to be the country
music association's

00:31.964 --> 00:33.998
"entertainer of the year."

00:33.999 --> 00:35.867
Let's have a big
<i>tool time</i> welcome

00:35.868 --> 00:39.303
For a great singing star
and fellow al,

00:39.304 --> 00:41.706
Mr. Alan jackson.

00:54.087 --> 00:57.088
That's quite a car.
Who did the customizing for you?

00:57.089 --> 00:59.090
I thought you were
taller than that.

00:59.091 --> 01:01.326
I look bigger on tv.

01:01.327 --> 01:03.428
Joe bailon.
Joe bailon did that!

01:03.429 --> 01:05.597
Joe bailon's a classic
customizer. One of the best.

01:05.598 --> 01:07.632
Boy. Could you get him
on the show for us?

01:07.633 --> 01:10.134
Tim, mr. Jackson is here

01:10.135 --> 01:12.971
Because he has graciously
offered to sing us a song.

01:12.972 --> 01:14.573
All right.
Sing for me.

01:14.574 --> 01:16.842
I got a mercury song,
"mercury blues."

01:16.843 --> 01:19.478
You want to see alan sing
"mercury blues"?

01:19.479 --> 01:21.212

Ladies and gentlemen,
alan jackson!

04:47.753 --> 04:50.088
How come you're having
people over for dinner?

04:50.089 --> 04:53.825
I thought you hated that.
It's a social obligation.

04:53.826 --> 04:56.694
Harry and delores had us for
dinner. So, we're having them.

04:56.695 --> 04:59.463
Then they'll want us again.
And we'll have them.

04:59.464 --> 05:01.766
Then us, then them,
and then us again.

05:01.767 --> 05:05.236
It's... It's kind of
a vicious cycle, actually.

05:05.237 --> 05:07.972
Can't you do anything to
stop the cycle?

05:07.973 --> 05:10.842
Nope.
My generation is doomed.

05:12.377 --> 05:15.312
My only hope is
that you young people

05:15.313 --> 05:18.950
Can finally put an end
to this madness.

05:18.951 --> 05:20.885
Yeah. We'll get right on it
right after we patch up

05:20.886 --> 05:23.655
That little hole
in the ozone layer.

05:23.656 --> 05:25.523
<i>(doorbell)</i>

05:25.524 --> 05:28.359
I'll get it.
Hi, mark.

05:28.360 --> 05:30.361
Hi, guys. See you later.
We're goin' to the mall.

05:30.362 --> 05:31.830
Oh, aren't you boys
joining us?

05:31.831 --> 05:33.431
Dad said we didn't
have to stay.

05:33.432 --> 05:36.167
Hey, did he mention if
I have to?

05:36.168 --> 05:38.336
Very nice, harry.

05:38.337 --> 05:40.071
Hi, guys.
Hi, jill.

05:40.072 --> 05:42.407
Hey, guys. Can I get you guys
something to drink?

05:42.408 --> 05:44.776
Yeah. I can use a drink
after a day like today.

05:44.777 --> 05:46.244
Why? What happened?

05:46.245 --> 05:50.448
I woke up and delores
was next to me.

05:50.449 --> 05:55.353
Yeah. Well, the view from
my side wasn't exactly
a kodak moment.

05:55.354 --> 05:58.189
Thanks.
So, the family doing well?

05:58.190 --> 05:59.790
Yeah.
Yeah?

05:59.791 --> 06:02.761
Little jimmy out of
that reform school yet?

06:02.762 --> 06:05.997
No, but he and his buddies
are working on a plan.

06:05.998 --> 06:08.766
Would you like to
sit down?
Sure. Thanks.

06:08.767 --> 06:10.968
So, what else is new?

06:10.969 --> 06:13.003
Well, they cut my hours back
at the coffee shop

06:13.004 --> 06:14.772
From full-time to
one day a week.

06:14.773 --> 06:16.641
Oh, delores,
I'm so sorry.

06:16.642 --> 06:18.643
Of course, they didn't take
any hours away

06:18.644 --> 06:20.645
From the younger,
prettier waitress.

06:20.646 --> 06:24.315
She's 60 years old!

06:24.316 --> 06:27.886
They didn't take any of her time
because she's nicer than you.

06:27.887 --> 06:31.656
I'm nice! Tim and jill
think I'm nice!

06:31.657 --> 06:33.324
Don't you think I'm nice?

06:33.325 --> 06:36.761
Oh, yeah. So nice.
Yes.

06:36.762 --> 06:40.231
You give new meaning to
the word "nice."

06:40.232 --> 06:41.966
So, delores, does this mean

06:41.967 --> 06:44.535
That you have to
look for a new job now?

06:44.536 --> 06:48.606
Yeah. 'course I wouldn't have to
if harry ran the hardware store
more efficiently.

06:48.607 --> 06:52.310
What's wrong with the way
I run the hardware store?

06:52.311 --> 06:54.779
In a nutshell -
everything.

06:54.780 --> 06:58.016
You let your lazy, bum friends
hang out and buy nothing.

06:58.017 --> 07:00.118
I should work there.

07:00.119 --> 07:02.387
I don't want you anywhere near
my hardware store.

07:02.388 --> 07:04.355
I'd whip it in shape
and double the profits.

07:04.356 --> 07:05.957
Let me jump in.

07:05.958 --> 07:08.359
Harry's hardware store is not
just a place to buy things.

07:08.360 --> 07:11.062
It's also a place where men hang
out. Women don't belong there.

07:11.063 --> 07:13.163
Really, tim?

07:14.800 --> 07:19.203
Where do women belong?

07:23.108 --> 07:24.909
A woman's hangout.

07:26.045 --> 07:29.379
Beauty parlor.
Yarn barn.

07:31.417 --> 07:33.851
If delores wants to work in
the hardware store,

07:33.852 --> 07:35.219
I see no reason why
she shouldn't do that.

07:35.220 --> 07:37.055
Thank you for
your support, jill.

07:37.056 --> 07:39.891
Delores, it'll be
a cold day in July before

07:39.892 --> 07:42.360
You get anywhere near
my hardware store!

07:42.361 --> 07:44.328
Guess what, harry.

07:44.329 --> 07:47.998
Summer's coming early
this year!

07:48.633 --> 07:50.802
Let's eat!

07:54.372 --> 07:56.807
Bye, harry! Bye, delores!
<i>(car engine roaring)</i>

07:56.808 --> 08:00.745
Harry, slow down the car
so delores can get in!

08:03.582 --> 08:06.417
That went well.
Yeah. Thanks a lot.

08:06.418 --> 08:07.852
For what?

08:07.853 --> 08:09.954
For trying to ruin
the hardware store.

08:09.955 --> 08:12.590
That's like the last refuge
I have on this planet.

08:12.591 --> 08:16.528
I thought that was
the bathroom.

08:16.529 --> 08:20.265
Why did you tell delores
it was a great idea to work
in the hardware store?

08:20.266 --> 08:23.534
Because I think it is.
What exactly do you do in

08:23.535 --> 08:25.903
The hardware store that you
can't do when delores is there?

08:25.904 --> 08:29.841
Guy stuff.
What kind of guy stuff?

08:29.842 --> 08:33.544
I can't tell you.
It's secret guy stuff.

08:33.546 --> 08:37.347
Oh! Please. All you guys do is
hang around the store all day

08:37.349 --> 08:38.917
And complain about your wives.

08:38.918 --> 08:41.719
Who told?

08:44.222 --> 08:47.124
Gotta be some
doughnuts in here someplace.

08:48.526 --> 08:51.362
Hey, benny! I found it!
Great.

08:51.363 --> 08:52.896
All right,
you freeloaders!

08:52.897 --> 08:54.765
You got five minutes to
buy something.

08:54.766 --> 08:57.468
Otherwise, you're out
on your fat rumps!

08:57.469 --> 09:02.606
Brings a soft, gentle quality
to the hardware store.

09:02.607 --> 09:04.442
Being around her
really is depressing.

09:04.443 --> 09:08.313
I have half a mind to
go out and look for a job.

09:08.314 --> 09:10.815
How do you think I feel?
I'm part owner,

09:10.816 --> 09:12.684
And she makes me feel
like a stock boy.

09:12.685 --> 09:15.119
Hey, stocky boy!

09:15.120 --> 09:17.388
Run across the street
and get me some hot tea.

09:17.389 --> 09:19.657
Yeah, "stocky boy."

09:19.658 --> 09:20.858
Remember how
she likes it -

09:20.859 --> 09:25.663
Two sugars and a big
lump of arsenic.

09:25.664 --> 09:27.098
Hey, guys.
Tim.

09:27.099 --> 09:29.367
Guess your day's
going better than ours is.

09:29.368 --> 09:30.902
Guess again.
The mustang's in the shop.

09:30.903 --> 09:33.370
I'm driving jill's nomad.
I hate driving her car.

09:33.371 --> 09:36.608
I get in there... No gas,
hasn't been washed in months.

09:36.609 --> 09:37.976
Cookie crumbs in
the front seat.

09:37.977 --> 09:39.978
Why can't she take care of
a car? How simple would it be--

09:39.979 --> 09:43.982
Could it be that she's
a tad busy going to school,
raising three kids

09:43.983 --> 09:47.218
And making sure you have
a nice house to come home to?

09:49.455 --> 09:51.688
Could be.

09:55.294 --> 09:58.329
This is unbelievable!
Something's wrong with
this country

09:58.330 --> 09:59.830
If you can't walk in
a hardware store

09:59.831 --> 10:02.700
And complain about your wife!
I'm telling you that right now!

10:02.701 --> 10:05.202
I can't find anything
back there!

10:05.203 --> 10:09.040
Delores insisted on filing
the clamps alphabetically.

10:09.041 --> 10:10.742
You gotta do that by size.

10:10.743 --> 10:12.510
She thinks size
doesn't matter.

10:12.511 --> 10:14.445
Lucky for you.

10:17.816 --> 10:22.386
Now, see? That's the kind of
joke we can't tell anymore
with delores around here.

10:22.387 --> 10:23.921
Do something
about your wife.

10:23.922 --> 10:25.856
What do you expect
me to do?

10:25.857 --> 10:28.993
Stand up to her. You faced
the enemy in nam, didn't you?

10:28.994 --> 10:32.730
Yeah, well, they were only
trying to kill me,
not run my life.

10:32.731 --> 10:35.266
Come on, you can do it!
You can do it.

10:35.267 --> 10:37.769
Harry! Harry! Harry! Harry...

10:37.770 --> 10:39.804
Hey! Hey!

10:39.805 --> 10:43.707
Why don't you neanderthals
take the pep rally back to
the cave?

10:45.143 --> 10:48.412
No retreat,
no surrender.

10:51.449 --> 10:54.152
<i>(mouthing)</i>

10:54.153 --> 10:57.622
Delores, I want to
talk to you!

10:57.623 --> 10:59.891
Oh, really?
What about?

10:59.892 --> 11:01.592
About you taking a hike.

11:01.593 --> 11:04.028
I don't want you working in
my hardware store anymore!

11:04.029 --> 11:06.898
Why? Because your friends
don't like it?

11:06.899 --> 11:09.967
Not that we don't like it...
Why are you getting in
our business?

11:09.968 --> 11:11.969
Because you're in
my business!

11:11.970 --> 11:14.072
Good point.
No one asked you.

11:14.073 --> 11:16.340
Also a good point.

11:16.341 --> 11:19.143
Harry, you've gotta decide
who comes first -

11:19.144 --> 11:22.613
Your stupid friends or me.

11:22.614 --> 11:24.015
Hm.

11:24.016 --> 11:27.551
When you put it that way,
my stupid friends!

11:28.921 --> 11:31.756
All right, harry.
Keep your hardware store.

11:31.757 --> 11:34.392
I'm outta here,
and I'm not coming back.

11:34.393 --> 11:35.793
Is that a promise?

11:35.794 --> 11:37.728
Yeah. And I'll promise you
another thing.

11:37.729 --> 11:40.931
When you get home tonight,
I'm not gonna be there either!

11:40.932 --> 11:45.469
Wait a minute. Delores, hold...
Harry, come on.

11:45.470 --> 11:47.805
Harry, aren't you
gonna go after her?

11:47.806 --> 11:49.273
I think she's serious
about leaving you.

11:49.274 --> 11:51.141
One can only hope.

11:59.451 --> 12:02.420
Man, is it great having
the hardware store back.

12:02.421 --> 12:03.954
What a relief.

12:03.955 --> 12:06.624
I was this close to
looking at the want ads.

12:09.695 --> 12:12.196
Hey, guys. Talk to harry?
Is he here?

12:12.197 --> 12:13.931
No. He overslept.

12:13.932 --> 12:15.899
Said it was the first time
in 25 years

12:15.900 --> 12:19.169
He didn't have delores' face
to shock him awake.

12:20.873 --> 12:23.907
Guys, this means
they really split up.

12:23.908 --> 12:25.909
He must feel terrible.

12:43.662 --> 12:47.431
Yeah, harry's pain's
really overwhelming him.

Hey, benny.
Look what I got you.

12:49.500 --> 12:52.269
Your favorite doughnuts
with sprinkles.

12:52.270 --> 12:54.205
All right!
Thanks, harry.

12:54.206 --> 12:57.141
Harry, you sure you
feel all right?
I feel great.

12:57.142 --> 12:58.742
In fact, I'm in such
a good mood,

12:58.743 --> 13:00.845
I'm gonna give you half off on

13:00.846 --> 13:03.714
Aw, hell! Just take it.

13:03.715 --> 13:07.218
Harry...
Um...

13:07.219 --> 13:09.386
Harry, you've been married
25 years, man.

13:09.387 --> 13:11.556
You gotta feel a little bad
about this. Huh?

13:11.557 --> 13:15.860
Yeah, you're right, tim.
I... I do feel bad...

13:15.861 --> 13:18.662
That it didn't happen
24 years ago!

13:25.603 --> 13:29.006
Hi, mom.
Hi.
This is so nice.

13:29.007 --> 13:32.776
It's a thank-you note from
delores for having them over
for dinner last week.

13:32.777 --> 13:34.778
Why is it only
from delores?

13:34.779 --> 13:37.148
Because men hate to
write these.

13:37.149 --> 13:38.382
You get a thank-you note
from a man,

13:38.383 --> 13:40.818
You know his wife is dead.

13:40.819 --> 13:44.755
We're guys. How come you make
us write thank-you notes?

13:44.756 --> 13:49.126
Because I'm trying to change
the world one boy at a time.

13:49.127 --> 13:53.798
We'll be sure to
send you a thank-you.
Hmm.

13:53.799 --> 13:56.267
Hi.
Hi.

13:56.268 --> 13:58.603
Got a thank-you note
from delores.

13:58.604 --> 14:00.404
That'll be the last one
we get from her.

14:00.405 --> 14:03.674
Stopped by the hardware store.
Look like they are splitting up.

14:03.675 --> 14:05.810
Oh, no. That's awful.

14:05.811 --> 14:07.544
You wouldn't know
that talking to harry.

14:07.545 --> 14:09.647
He's acting like this is
the greatest thing that ever
happened to him.

14:09.648 --> 14:11.381
He is?
Yeah.

14:11.382 --> 14:13.250
You know what?
I'm not buying it.

14:13.251 --> 14:14.785
They argue a lot, yes.

14:14.786 --> 14:17.220
He loves her. Deep down
somewhere this guy is hurting.

14:17.221 --> 14:20.024
Oh, my god!
What happened?

14:20.025 --> 14:23.460
Did you just hear yourself?
You had an insight!

14:27.199 --> 14:29.934
Me?
Yes.

14:29.935 --> 14:32.603
And it was
incredibly sensitive.

14:32.604 --> 14:36.139
Instead of taking harry's
behavior at face value,

14:36.140 --> 14:39.543
You looked deeper
and saw his inner pain.

14:39.544 --> 14:42.980
I didn't mean to. I swear to god
I didn't mean to do that.

14:42.981 --> 14:45.315
You know what's happening,
don't you?

14:45.316 --> 14:48.452
No.
You're evolving.

14:48.453 --> 14:51.154
No, I'm not!
And you take that back!

14:51.155 --> 14:53.557
It's true. You are.
Now, now, now.

14:53.558 --> 14:55.993
You're just saying that
because you want to believe

14:55.994 --> 14:57.995
That you married a deep guy.

14:57.996 --> 14:59.896
No, I don't.
Yes!

14:59.897 --> 15:01.732
Can't you see that
you're just trying to prove

15:01.733 --> 15:03.334
That you married somebody
different than your father.

15:03.335 --> 15:05.402
Wow!

15:06.672 --> 15:09.540
What?

15:09.541 --> 15:12.042
That was an even more
profound insight

15:12.043 --> 15:14.845
Than the one that you had
about harry!

15:14.846 --> 15:18.015
I can't stop myself.
What's happening to me?

15:18.016 --> 15:21.819
You're becoming
insightful.

15:21.820 --> 15:23.854
Oh, no.

15:23.855 --> 15:27.458
Don't fight it, tim.
Come over to our side.

15:27.459 --> 15:28.859
Oh, no. Never.

15:28.860 --> 15:31.429
You and your kind have done
enough damage already.

15:37.435 --> 15:40.805
Hi, wilson.
Well, hi-de-ho,
good neighbor.

15:40.806 --> 15:43.006
I was just on my way over there
to wish you and jill

15:43.007 --> 15:45.009
A happy terminalia day.

15:45.010 --> 15:49.480
Happy terminalia day?
Mm-hmm.

15:49.481 --> 15:52.149
What's this one all about?
Ah, terminalia day.

15:52.150 --> 15:55.252
This is a roman festival
where neighbors bond with
each other

15:55.253 --> 15:57.855
In order to promote
the spirit of community.

15:57.856 --> 15:59.657
Wonderful.
How do they do that?

15:59.658 --> 16:02.659
Well, traditionally,
they slaughter a suckling pig

16:02.660 --> 16:05.730
And then they splatter
their fences with its blood.

16:05.731 --> 16:07.598
Well, I've slaughtered
a marriage this week.

16:07.599 --> 16:09.767
Bring on the pig!

16:09.768 --> 16:12.403
Trouble with you and jill?

16:12.404 --> 16:14.104
No.

16:14.105 --> 16:16.006
Trouble with
harry and delores.

16:16.007 --> 16:20.344
Oh! You're telling me
that delores and harry

16:20.345 --> 16:23.447
May bid each other
a not-so-fond adieu.

16:23.448 --> 16:26.684
This has nothing to do
with a bowl of hot cheese.

16:31.022 --> 16:33.057
I gathered that, tim.

16:33.058 --> 16:35.025
This is about a couple
that shouldn't be splitting up.

16:35.026 --> 16:37.627
He's singing about it.
But I know differently.

16:37.628 --> 16:41.198
I know somewhere this guy still
loves her. I know that!

16:41.199 --> 16:44.868
Tim, that is so insightful.

16:48.239 --> 16:50.975
Don't start with me.

16:50.976 --> 16:53.978
Just give me some advice on how
I can help my friend harry.

16:53.979 --> 16:55.512
Well, have you tried
talking to him?

16:55.513 --> 16:58.415
Yes, I've tried talking to him.
I've been to the hardware store.

16:58.416 --> 17:00.784
I've called a couple times, but
he acts like nothing's going on.

17:00.785 --> 17:03.720
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm,
mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

17:03.721 --> 17:07.290
Tim, I'm reminded of the french
author, andre gide, who wrote:

17:07.291 --> 17:10.894
"it is not by plugging away
at a difficulty that one can
overcome it.

17:10.895 --> 17:15.265
Often it's by working
on the difficulty next to it."

17:15.266 --> 17:19.170
Ah!
I did not know that.

17:19.171 --> 17:21.939
If you're having trouble
getting through to harry,

17:21.940 --> 17:24.842
Why don't you try to
approach delores?

17:24.843 --> 17:27.310
Oh, talk to delores.
Mm-hmm.

17:27.311 --> 17:30.614
I could do that. Or shove
my head in a bench grinder.

17:37.155 --> 17:38.755
I'll be right with you.

17:41.927 --> 17:45.662
What do you want?
I want to talk about harry.

17:45.663 --> 17:48.465
Sorry, that's not on the menu.
What's it gonna be?

17:48.466 --> 17:51.702
Ever since you left,
harry's not himself.
I'm heartbroken.

17:51.703 --> 17:54.004
Now, just order something
and leave me a big tip.

17:54.005 --> 17:57.040
I'll have a couple eggs.
But he really misses you.

17:57.041 --> 17:59.477
Scrambled or fried?
Scrambled. He's a mess.

17:59.478 --> 18:01.645
How do you know?
The way he's been acting.

18:01.646 --> 18:03.246
He's moping around, huh?

18:03.247 --> 18:07.318
Well, in a
singing-dancing-moping
kind of way.

18:07.319 --> 18:09.420
He's singing and dancing
now that I'm gone?

18:09.421 --> 18:11.121
I know that sounds bad.
Know why he's doing that?

18:11.122 --> 18:13.557
He's covering because
he really misses you.

18:13.558 --> 18:17.161
Of course he misses me.
What's not to miss?

18:17.162 --> 18:19.029
Miss, could I get
a little more coffee?

18:19.030 --> 18:22.299
When I'm good and ready!

18:22.300 --> 18:24.901
I might have said some things
that made the situation worse.

18:24.902 --> 18:27.004
I hate to see
a good marriage go bad.

18:27.005 --> 18:30.674
What does a good marriage have
to do with me and harry?

18:30.675 --> 18:32.843
Come on! I know harry
still loves you.

18:32.844 --> 18:35.379
I can tell by the twinkle in
your eye that you love him.

18:35.380 --> 18:38.181
It's pinkeye.
You want toast?

18:38.182 --> 18:41.819
No.
If harry misses me so much,

18:41.820 --> 18:44.788
Why doesn't he come down here
and tell me himself?

18:44.789 --> 18:46.824
You know how
stubborn he can be.

18:46.825 --> 18:50.327
Uh, what about my coffee?
What? Your legs broken?

18:53.598 --> 18:55.632
Is that decaf?
Is that what you want?

18:55.633 --> 18:58.235
Yes.
Then that's what it is.

19:03.508 --> 19:05.442
Delores, what do you say
when you end your shift,

19:05.443 --> 19:07.210
You just go to
the store and talk to him?

19:07.211 --> 19:09.780
I don't know.
I've known harry a long time.

19:09.781 --> 19:12.983
I've never known him to go a day
without bad-mouthing you.

19:12.984 --> 19:15.252
That's supposed to make me
want to go back to him?

19:15.253 --> 19:18.055
Yes, it is. Listen to me.
'cause that's the real harry.

19:18.056 --> 19:20.190
You know he doesn't mean
any of that stuff.

19:20.191 --> 19:24.028
This happy harry is putting on
a show and unfortunately it's
a musical.

19:24.029 --> 19:26.163
So, you think he's
really miserable, huh?

19:26.164 --> 19:27.965
Yeah, I do.

19:27.966 --> 19:31.802
Well, maybe when my shift is
over, I'll go talk to him.

19:31.803 --> 19:35.940
Well... Why don't you go now?
I'll cover for you.

19:35.941 --> 19:39.043
Yeah?
Yeah.

19:39.044 --> 19:41.478
Thanks. I mean,
there's nothing to it.

19:41.479 --> 19:44.348
Just pick up the orders
and give them to the customers.

19:44.349 --> 19:48.052
Ok.
And make sure to smile.
People don't like a sourpuss.

19:51.856 --> 19:55.192
You know, tim, I never realized
you were such a sensitive guy.

19:55.193 --> 19:57.961
Yeah, me neither.
I've had a very bad week.

20:06.671 --> 20:08.439
<i>(tim sighs)</i>

20:08.440 --> 20:11.508
Hi. It's 8:30.
You must be exhausted.

20:11.509 --> 20:14.078
Oh, boy!
You bet I am.

20:14.079 --> 20:16.780
I had no idea delores' shift
was 12 hours.

20:20.952 --> 20:24.622
So, are she and harry
back together now?
Mm-hmm.

20:24.623 --> 20:26.756
I explained to her
how harry was feeling,

20:26.757 --> 20:28.225
She went down to the hardware
store to talk to him,

20:28.226 --> 20:30.160
And they're gonna
work things out.

20:30.161 --> 20:34.131
Tim, I...
I can't tell you

20:34.132 --> 20:37.801
How impressed I am by
the emotional depth
that I've seen in you lately.

20:37.802 --> 20:39.470
Oh! You know...

20:39.471 --> 20:43.240
I've always had this sneaky,
yet slightly disturbing,
suspicion

20:43.241 --> 20:48.145
That there actually might be
something to me.

20:48.146 --> 20:51.281
I knew it all along.
I might be hiding my depth

20:51.282 --> 20:52.983
Because I'm afraid
it might separate me

20:52.984 --> 20:56.319
From the shallow people
I'm most comfortable with.

20:58.689 --> 21:00.924
Who exactly are
you talking about?

21:00.925 --> 21:02.826
You find this threatening,
intimidating, don't you?

21:02.827 --> 21:06.730
Well, just get used to it.

21:06.731 --> 21:11.935
Because I'm finding
the deeper I go,
the more riches I discover.

21:13.037 --> 21:15.005
Tim...

21:15.006 --> 21:18.909
You know, you can go
too far with this.

21:18.910 --> 21:22.279
I think you should keep your
insights to just one a month.

21:22.280 --> 21:27.151
I don't think
I can do that.

21:27.152 --> 21:30.788
Oh, come on.
Bring me back my old tim.

21:30.789 --> 21:33.157
Grunt for me.

21:33.158 --> 21:37.360
Ok. I'll give it a shot.

21:37.361 --> 21:39.362
<i>(weak grunt)</i>

21:42.500 --> 21:45.436
Ar... Ar...
I don't think that's...

21:45.437 --> 21:47.938
It's not happening, honey.

21:50.742 --> 21:52.743
<i>(tim)</i> mm.

21:52.744 --> 21:56.079
Oh, yeah. <i>(grunts)</i>

21:57.815 --> 22:00.117
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah!

22:00.118 --> 22:03.052
He's back.
<i>(grunts)</i>

22:03.053 --> 22:06.023
Uh, excuse me.
She forgot my doughnut.

22:06.024 --> 22:08.191
Really?

22:08.192 --> 22:10.260
No one finished that one.

22:13.631 --> 22:17.100
Ok...

22:17.101 --> 22:19.970
You must be the pancakes,
and you're the fruit.

22:24.809 --> 22:27.877
Hey! I don't go for
that sort of thing!
