Usually when
you gets the flu,

00:11.881 --> 00:13.317
it just passes
in a day or two.

00:13.404 --> 00:15.363
This doesn't
present like a flu.

00:15.450 --> 00:16.451
Bruce, we
got some samples
coming in from Florida.

00:16.538 --> 00:17.843
Not it!

00:17.930 --> 00:19.715
We need
an anthrax expert.

00:19.802 --> 00:21.673
Patient's spinal fluid
showed rod-like bacteria.

00:21.760 --> 00:23.501
You better call the FBI.

00:23.588 --> 00:26.026
Anthrax uses its
host as a live incubator and

00:26.113 --> 00:29.377
95% of confirmed cases
worldwide are cutaneous,

00:29.464 --> 00:32.771
which means it gets into a
cut where someone touches it.

00:32.858 --> 00:35.470
But Bob Stevens inhaled it,

00:35.557 --> 00:37.907
which is insanely rare
unless it's aerosolized.

00:37.994 --> 00:39.517

was the only media attack.

00:39.604 --> 00:41.389
What do you mean?

it was just a spider bite.

It doesn't.

03:05.924 --> 03:08.884
Yes,
extreme heat can destroy

but the spores

04:37.146 --> 04:39.888
This new anthrax case at NBC?

04:39.975 --> 04:43.021
Related to what, 9/11
or the anthrax in Florida?

04:43.108 --> 04:44.849
Florida.

04:44.936 --> 04:48.592
Already know the answer to
Al-Qaeda is a big old yes.

Well, there hasn't been
a case of inhalational anthrax

you start seeing them?

04:55.295 --> 04:56.861
It's all got to be connected.

04:56.948 --> 04:58.472
So that's
an affirmative?

04:58.559 --> 05:02.258
Uh, no.
That's a working hypothesis.

Okay. That's good.

I'd contact security.

Okay.

Now think back to the last
time you called security about

06:56.894 --> 07:02.291
something suspicious, maybe
there was a particular phrase,

07:02.378 --> 07:06.251
or message, a color?

Okay.
Did they find the

07:53.951 --> 07:55.953

figure out why it is that this

11:52.450 --> 11:54.104

11:54.191 --> 11:55.802
Well, it's my
understanding that the CDC's

11:55.889 --> 11:57.804
been swamped with

11:57.891 --> 11:59.153

had enough of that, okay?

11:59.240 --> 12:00.676

make sure the CDC's on it.

12:15.473 --> 12:17.258
You should have

You think he's just
worried about his assistant?

12:30.793 --> 12:33.230
No, he's right.

12:33.317 --> 12:35.058
But this thing will start
going sideways fast if

12:35.145 --> 12:37.365
we start taking special
consideration to big titles.

12:37.452 --> 12:39.323
Copy that.

12:39.410 --> 12:42.500
Elevators are just
around the corner.

12:42.587 --> 12:44.067
Until we find a source,

12:44.154 --> 12:46.069
we need to shut down
the entire building.

12:46.156 --> 12:47.201
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I
thought you just said we were

12:47.288 --> 12:48.985
just here as a specialist?

12:49.072 --> 12:50.073
As a specialist,
I'm telling you we need to

12:50.160 --> 12:51.335
shut the building down.

12:51.422 --> 12:53.337
On whose authority?

12:53.424 --> 12:54.817
Just tell everyone this
investigation now falls under

12:54.904 --> 12:57.559
Operation Noble Eagle.

12:57.646 --> 13:00.127
Hey, uh, should
we call Copak first?

13:00.214 --> 13:01.737
I mean, if we're gonna be
pulling the Presidential card?

13:01.824 --> 13:03.870
If not now, then when?

13:03.957 --> 13:06.437
Listen Sergeant,
somewhere in this
building is a lethal agent

13:06.524 --> 13:08.744
and we cannot let
anyone else be exposed.

13:12.922 --> 13:14.315
Which way?

13:14.402 --> 13:16.143
Uh, it's up
here to the right.

13:16.230 --> 13:18.841
Thousands of employees,
acres of office space.

13:18.928 --> 13:23.193
Any idea how much
mail must come through
a building like this?

13:23.280 --> 13:25.282
Single letter is like
finding a needle in a...

13:29.896 --> 13:32.550
I'd prefer a haystack.

13:32.637 --> 13:34.248
I take it you're
the agent asking for me?

13:34.335 --> 13:36.076
What can I do for you?

13:36.163 --> 13:38.687
What's your
hate mail protocol?

13:38.774 --> 13:41.559
I wouldn't call
it much of a protocol.

13:41.646 --> 13:44.519
Any threatening letters get
funneled down through here.

13:44.606 --> 13:48.349
So you fellas
collect it for testing.

13:48.436 --> 13:51.439
It's a little backed up right
now because of Ground Zero.

13:54.224 --> 13:56.357
Chris, clear
out this whole area and

13:56.444 --> 13:58.141
let's get a
Hazmat team in here.

13:58.228 --> 14:00.056
We're gonna go through
every single piece of mail.

14:00.143 --> 14:01.710
That letter's got to
be in here somewhere.

14:17.160 --> 14:19.206
Check everything carefully.

14:19.293 --> 14:22.339
The letter Erin opened has
to be here and if you find

14:22.426 --> 14:24.951
anything with powder,
stop immediately.

14:25.038 --> 14:26.996
We need to preserve all
the source as we can.

14:27.083 --> 14:28.476
This one has
a flagged corner.

14:28.563 --> 14:30.260
That's on the right.

14:30.347 --> 14:31.566
Right.

14:33.133 --> 14:35.613
Copy that.

14:35.700 --> 14:37.093
We're almost halfway
through the mail here, sir,

14:37.180 --> 14:39.226
still nothing.

14:52.021 --> 14:53.544
What the hell?

14:57.070 --> 15:00.116
Hey, hey.

15:00.203 --> 15:02.466
This building is contaminated.

15:02.553 --> 15:04.773
Why are people
flooding in here like
it's any other Friday?

15:04.860 --> 15:06.253
Agent Ryker,
it wasn't my call.

15:06.340 --> 15:07.863
Then whose was it?

15:07.950 --> 15:09.038
Not that
it's your business.

15:09.125 --> 15:10.605
Mayor Giuliani.

15:10.692 --> 15:12.346
The call was mine.

15:12.433 --> 15:14.261
No one is
shutting down 30 Rock.

15:14.348 --> 15:16.524
Mr. Mayor,
you're not hearing me.

15:16.611 --> 15:19.483
Really?
Because it seems
you're not hearing me.

15:19.570 --> 15:22.486
You're not the acting
superior in this jurisdiction.

15:22.573 --> 15:24.358
Erin O'Connor
is infected.

15:24.445 --> 15:26.882
Not only are all of her
colleagues at risk but so is

15:26.969 --> 15:29.363
every person who
steps into the building.

15:29.450 --> 15:32.279
We need to evacuate, we need
to get a hazmat team in there

15:32.366 --> 15:34.194
so we can scan every
inch of the place.

15:34.281 --> 15:35.412
Do you
have a positive test,

15:35.499 --> 15:37.153
a confirmation on the victim?

15:37.240 --> 15:38.807
No, not yet.

15:38.894 --> 15:42.506
Any other
sick workers? Any proof?

15:42.593 --> 15:46.467
I'm talking absolute that
anthrax is in this building.

15:46.554 --> 15:48.295
That's why
we're searching.

15:48.382 --> 15:50.210
Just because one
person who might have it,

15:50.297 --> 15:52.516
might've been
exposed weeks ago, uh,

15:52.603 --> 15:55.519
is already being
treated and nobody
else is showing symptoms,

15:55.606 --> 15:57.869
yet you're trying
to shut down one of the,

15:57.957 --> 15:59.654
the busiest
buildings in my city.

15:59.741 --> 16:01.656
Sir, with
all due respect.

16:01.743 --> 16:03.527
You're here looking
through a microscope but, uh,

16:03.614 --> 16:04.746
I've got to
see the big picture.

16:04.833 --> 16:06.574
Okay.

16:06.661 --> 16:09.490
Well here's an image,
anthrax spores do not die off.

16:09.577 --> 16:11.709
They settle, they lie in wait.

16:11.796 --> 16:14.538
What we are talking about
is a ticking time bomb.

16:14.625 --> 16:17.063
Mayor Giuliani, please.

16:20.675 --> 16:22.938
Plenty of twisted
pricks get their rocks off

16:23.025 --> 16:24.853
by scaring people.

16:24.940 --> 16:26.898
If they shut down every
building that had a hoax,

16:26.986 --> 16:29.031
wouldn't be a building
open come Christmas.

16:31.120 --> 16:32.904
Do you have any idea what the
good people of this city have

16:32.992 --> 16:33.949
been through these last weeks?

16:34.036 --> 16:35.690
I understand.

16:35.777 --> 16:36.996
Hell, the city
gets threats every day.

16:39.302 --> 16:41.217
I need at
least the third floor.

16:41.304 --> 16:44.568
NBC and its adjacent offices.

16:44.655 --> 16:48.050
Look, I can use
the freight entrance.

16:48.137 --> 16:53.229
Mr. Mayor, you
haven't seen what this
bacteria does to a body.

17:03.587 --> 17:06.938
Clear the entrance.
Let's move, guys, move.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.766
Just make sure it's taped off.

17:11.160 --> 17:12.770
Block that corner off.

17:12.857 --> 17:15.599
And you guys got to
rotate it out of the suit.

17:15.686 --> 17:17.036
We've only got
the third floor,

17:17.123 --> 17:18.602
but make sure
you swab everything.

17:18.689 --> 17:19.864
Copy that.

18:01.776 --> 18:06.346
Didn't they say
the subject had a lesion
indicating cutaneous anthrax?

18:06.433 --> 18:08.957
It's negative.

18:09.044 --> 18:10.263
Negative?

18:19.228 --> 18:20.099
I think maybe
we should test it again.

18:21.578 --> 18:23.189
We tested
it twice, Bruce.

18:23.276 --> 18:24.886
Are you in
a hurry to get out of here?

18:24.973 --> 18:27.280
After 20-plus hours
of straight lab work?

18:27.367 --> 18:29.325
Yes, Bruce, I am.

18:29.412 --> 18:31.153
I don't know about you, but
if I'm gonna do that again,

18:31.240 --> 18:33.068
I'm gonna need some sleep.

18:33.155 --> 18:35.592
Hey, Simon.

18:35.679 --> 18:36.898
Did you open my...

19:12.803 --> 19:15.154
I'll call you back.

19:15.241 --> 19:16.807
There's a
flight leaving at 12:25.

19:16.894 --> 19:18.374
Great.
Get me on it.

19:25.860 --> 19:27.775
Morning, sir.

19:27.862 --> 19:29.864
Wasn't trying to be nosy, but
I was looking for you earlier.

19:29.951 --> 19:31.866
Susan said you were up
in the Director's office.

19:33.128 --> 19:34.651
Yeah.

19:34.738 --> 19:37.698
Lot of heads
rolling this morning?

19:37.785 --> 19:41.354
Just a friendly
reminder that we either

19:41.441 --> 19:46.576
get out front of this story
or we become the story.

19:46.663 --> 19:49.536
Hmm, locking
horns right out of the gate?

19:49.623 --> 19:50.798
With the Director?

19:50.885 --> 19:52.800
No. We go back.

19:54.889 --> 19:57.674
- Princeton, right?
- Yeah.

19:57.761 --> 20:00.895
Before the bronze star,
Purple Heart.

20:00.982 --> 20:04.768
He took the law firm,
Attorney General route and

20:04.855 --> 20:07.206
I dedicated my
life to the bureau.

20:07.293 --> 20:09.382
My mistake.

20:09.469 --> 20:12.036
Always easier climbing
new stairs than the ones

20:12.123 --> 20:14.604
you've been
slogging up for years.

20:14.691 --> 20:16.345
Well, Van Harp's
keeping me busy,

20:16.432 --> 20:18.478
but if you need extra
hands on the anthrax case.

20:18.565 --> 20:21.263
Oh, Ryker's on it.

20:21.350 --> 20:23.918
I know the cells in our
AOR better than anyone, sir.

20:24.005 --> 20:25.615
If I start
pulling agents off

20:25.702 --> 20:28.357
9/11 without confirmation
this is an attack.

20:28.444 --> 20:30.403
Of course, sir.

20:30.490 --> 20:32.231
But if it is, this whole
thing could blow wide open.

20:45.548 --> 20:48.159
We went through
everything in there.

20:48.247 --> 20:50.161
Did you
find the letter?

20:50.249 --> 20:54.035
I thought
we had something
but it was just a hoax.

20:54.122 --> 20:55.515
I don't know what to tell you.

20:55.602 --> 20:57.125
There's no anthrax
letter in that room.

20:57.212 --> 20:59.083
That makes no sense.

20:59.170 --> 21:01.608
That lesion on Erin O'Connor's
shoulder is no hoax.

21:01.695 --> 21:03.566
That letter's gotta
be here somewhere.

21:03.653 --> 21:05.307
About that, they just
brought in O'Connor's biopsy.

21:05.394 --> 21:07.788
And?

21:07.875 --> 21:11.008
- Tested negative.
- What?

21:18.842 --> 21:21.105
Actually, O'Connor's
been on Cipro for days.

21:21.192 --> 21:23.891
Once Cipro is established
in the bloodstream,

21:23.978 --> 21:27.590
I'm thinking it could result
in a false gram-negative.

21:27.677 --> 21:29.723
Dr. Zaki over at the
CDC is working on an

21:29.810 --> 21:32.900
experimental strip to expedite
gram-positive testing.

21:32.987 --> 21:34.380
It'll be more conclusive.

21:34.467 --> 21:35.424
Give them a call.

21:35.511 --> 21:36.730
Yeah.

21:38.514 --> 21:40.473
Things are good.

21:40.560 --> 21:43.040
Lately with
Diane and the kids,

21:43.127 --> 21:45.565
everything's clicking.

21:45.652 --> 21:49.133
I mean, the only
stressful thing is...

21:49.220 --> 21:51.919
And how
has work been lately?

21:52.006 --> 21:53.268
And other than that,

21:53.355 --> 21:56.097
how was the play,
Mrs. Lincoln?

21:56.184 --> 21:57.490
Do you
want to expand on that?

21:57.577 --> 21:59.230
Stressful.

21:59.318 --> 22:01.232
I mean, you know, we're
at the epicenter of this

22:01.320 --> 22:05.280
anthrax business and
the country under attack.

22:05.367 --> 22:07.500
Haven't been able to
see the kids much lately.

22:07.587 --> 22:09.023
It's quite common
to pull away when there is

22:09.110 --> 22:11.068
stress in the workplace.

22:11.155 --> 22:13.462
There is nothing
common about my work.

22:13.549 --> 22:15.986
What's
happening there?

22:16.073 --> 22:17.814
What's adding anxiety?

22:31.480 --> 22:34.614
Bruce? Where
did you just go?

22:34.701 --> 22:36.355
Sorry.

22:40.750 --> 22:43.057
I know
9/11 really rattled you,

22:43.144 --> 22:45.364
but it's good that you've
come here for more support.

22:49.280 --> 22:52.022
My work at USAMRIID,
dealing with DOD,

22:52.109 --> 22:55.591
it's high clearance stuff.

22:55.678 --> 22:58.507
These conversations
are confidential.

23:06.254 --> 23:08.082
Since the
situation in Florida,

23:08.169 --> 23:13.217
things have been unhinged.

23:13.304 --> 23:17.744
And now with New York, the
samples keep flooding in and

23:17.831 --> 23:22.575
it's up to us to separate
the hoaxes from the real deal.

23:24.664 --> 23:27.188
We're this line of defense
nobody even knows exists.

23:29.277 --> 23:31.410
Would you say
you feel under-appreciated?

23:32.889 --> 23:35.326
What? No.

23:35.414 --> 23:39.026
What I'm saying is that
it's just us in there,

23:39.113 --> 23:40.419
this select
group of scientists,

23:40.506 --> 23:42.377
some of us barely
know each other.

23:42.464 --> 23:44.335
Even in a vacuum, how do you
trust someone with something

23:44.423 --> 23:50.516
so paramount as the
safety of our nation?

23:50.603 --> 23:53.344
Bruce, do you
suspect someone at work

23:53.432 --> 23:55.477
is possibly involved?

24:08.011 --> 24:09.404
This way.

24:14.757 --> 24:18.065
They're still working on
those contaminants as well.

24:18.152 --> 24:19.458
Yeah, they are.

25:53.726 --> 25:55.162
I assure you,

25:55.249 --> 25:56.337
this won't get blown
out of proportion.

25:56.424 --> 25:58.208
Better not.

25:58.295 --> 25:59.427
I asked for a babysitter and
was promised you'd have an

25:59.514 --> 26:00.950
iron grip on the situation.

26:01.037 --> 26:03.257
Mayor.

26:03.344 --> 26:05.172
Sir.

26:05.259 --> 26:07.827
We just got results from
Erin O'Connor's latest biopsy.

26:07.914 --> 26:10.394
She's positive for anthrax.

26:10.481 --> 26:12.179
Her first test was
a false negative because

26:12.266 --> 26:14.094
she'd already been on Cipro.

26:14.181 --> 26:16.009
Didn't I already
give you what you asked for?

26:16.096 --> 26:17.880
We need to do a lot
more than close off one floor.

26:17.967 --> 26:20.056
Anthrax is here.

26:20.143 --> 26:22.015
- Who ran the test?
- CDC.

26:22.102 --> 26:24.191
Brand new testing method.

26:24.278 --> 26:26.106
And by new,
is that some sort of
experimental thing?

26:26.193 --> 26:28.804
And?

26:28.891 --> 26:30.458
Unless you
have any new proof that

26:30.545 --> 26:32.242
she got it here at 30 Rock.

26:32.329 --> 26:34.157
How is a positive
biopsy result not enough?

26:34.244 --> 26:35.550
Ryker.

26:35.637 --> 26:37.334
I'll
take that as a no.

26:37.421 --> 26:38.945
Mayor Giuliani,
the press is ready for you.

26:39.032 --> 26:40.599
And Assistant Director
Mawn is standing by.

26:40.686 --> 26:42.252
Thank you.

26:44.254 --> 26:45.952
You gotta understand,

26:46.039 --> 26:48.302
the local team is doing
everything by the book.

26:48.389 --> 26:50.913
They're good.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.959
But they need more to go on.

26:53.046 --> 26:55.483
Conjecture is the enemy here.

26:55.570 --> 26:58.878
You get an attack letter in an
evidence bag and hold it up in

26:58.965 --> 27:01.663
front of the cameras,
I can get us anything we want.

27:01.750 --> 27:04.666
We went through
every inch of that mailroom.

27:04.753 --> 27:06.886
Erin knows she
handed the letter off.

27:06.973 --> 27:09.410
Then you jumped
a step when you retraced it.

27:11.238 --> 27:14.154
The truth is never about
what should have happened.

27:18.158 --> 27:20.813
Thank
you all for coming.

27:20.900 --> 27:23.163
I just wanna be clear
that we're, we're,

27:23.250 --> 27:24.773
we're talking with
you today because

27:24.860 --> 27:27.733
we're being overly cautious.

27:27.820 --> 27:30.300
All employees, as well as
areas of the building that

27:30.387 --> 27:33.173
may have been
exposed will be tested.

27:33.260 --> 27:35.262
We're
missing something.

27:35.349 --> 27:37.264
We've been
through every piece
of hate mail twice.

27:39.048 --> 27:41.007
Mailroom doesn't
bag them, though, do they?

27:41.094 --> 27:42.791
Uh, no.

27:42.878 --> 27:44.184
I think security guards
collect potential threats

27:44.271 --> 27:45.838
from each floor.

27:45.925 --> 27:48.536
Which guard
handles the mail from NBC?

27:48.623 --> 27:50.886
<i>GIULIANI : After </i>
a long talk with the CDC,

27:50.973 --> 27:52.888
<i>the chances that </i>
this is contained, uh...

27:54.368 --> 27:56.196
What do you need, pal?

27:56.283 --> 27:58.415
FBI.

27:58.502 --> 28:01.070
We're looking
for a letter that was
addressed to Tom Brokaw,

28:01.157 --> 28:02.724
came in a green plastic bag.

28:02.811 --> 28:04.160
Seen anything like that?

28:04.247 --> 28:05.553
I don't know.

28:05.640 --> 28:07.990
It can be anywhere in here.

28:08.077 --> 28:09.600
Start over there.

28:12.647 --> 28:14.736
While the
powder in the letter, uh,

28:14.823 --> 28:16.825
proved negative for anthrax,

28:16.912 --> 28:20.002
a skin biopsy
did test positive.

28:20.089 --> 28:25.225
And since this
incident could date back
as early as September 25th,

28:25.312 --> 28:27.618
there's a
decent shot that, uh,

28:27.706 --> 28:29.620
anyone who might
have been exposed, uh,

28:29.708 --> 28:31.013
would be by now.

28:31.100 --> 28:32.101
That is our hope.

28:33.712 --> 28:36.323
I encourage everyone
not to overreacting.

28:36.410 --> 28:40.631
NBC's in control of the
situation and cooperation with

28:40.719 --> 28:45.898
governmental agencies, that's
including the CDC and the FBI.

28:45.985 --> 28:48.814
If anyone receives
any suspicious mail,

28:48.901 --> 28:53.993
the best thing to do,
contact the police or FBI.

29:08.398 --> 29:11.140
Get out.

29:11.227 --> 29:13.142
Leave the sandwich.

29:14.535 --> 29:18.974
Chris, stay back.

29:19.061 --> 29:21.934
I'm vaccinated,
but you need to leave.

29:22.021 --> 29:23.805
And get that guy on Cipro.

29:31.247 --> 29:33.597
<i>REPORTER : </i>
Excuse me, Mr. Giuliani.

29:33.684 --> 29:35.295
<i>REPORTER 2 : </i>
Mayor, clarify what
the CDC told you today?

29:35.382 --> 29:38.298
<i>Exactly how safe </i>
is 30 Rock right now?

29:38.385 --> 29:42.693
<i>GIULIANI : </i>
The CDC and the FBI
have informed us that the

29:42.781 --> 29:45.479
<i>chances that this is </i>
contained are very good.

29:47.960 --> 29:49.483
Any
connection to 9/11?

29:52.138 --> 29:54.096
I'll let
our local Assistant
Director Mawn answer that.

29:54.183 --> 29:55.315
Mawn?

29:55.402 --> 29:57.970
Thank you, Mayor.

29:58.057 --> 30:00.973
<i>MAWN : Uh, </i>
at this moment, we see
absolutely zero link to 9/11.

30:22.211 --> 30:23.909
So it is terrorists.

30:23.996 --> 30:25.562
Our forensics
might find more,

30:25.649 --> 30:28.391
but I'm not seeing
any identifiers, Dr. Layton.

30:28.478 --> 30:30.176
And there's no
obvious fingerprints,

30:30.263 --> 30:31.917
there's no hair.

30:32.004 --> 30:34.093
The envelope has
been taped, not licked,

30:34.180 --> 30:36.660
so we're not gonna
pull any DNA evidence.

30:36.747 --> 30:38.401
The letter itself
is photocopied,

30:38.488 --> 30:41.056
so we're not gonna
get any ink samples.

30:41.143 --> 30:44.930
They did
leave us something
to go off of, postmark.

30:45.017 --> 30:47.280
Maybe it
could be traced back
to the point of origin.

30:47.367 --> 30:49.456
Right.
And track it down to where
it was first dropped off.

30:49.543 --> 30:51.371
Yeah.
Follow up with
the postal service.

30:51.458 --> 30:52.676
Okay. Got it.

30:54.504 --> 30:56.419
If this is
a match for Florida,

30:56.506 --> 30:59.248
we've got
a full-blown bioweapons
attack on our hands.

30:59.335 --> 31:03.035
Question is, who
else is a target?

31:03.122 --> 31:05.864
Well letters
were sent to AMI and NBC.

31:05.951 --> 31:09.171
I'm starting to think this
is an attack on the media.

31:11.826 --> 31:14.133
First showed
up over a week ago.

31:14.220 --> 31:16.265
My doctor
prescribed antibiotics.

31:16.352 --> 31:18.441
He said it was a spider bite.

31:18.528 --> 31:20.443
But it's not, is it?

31:20.530 --> 31:23.142
What's important is
that it looks to be resolving.

31:23.229 --> 31:25.448
We'll need to run
some tests, though.

31:25.535 --> 31:27.146
Whatever you need to
do to take down the cowards

31:27.233 --> 31:28.538
who are doing this.

31:31.585 --> 31:34.849
Do you remember
opening any suspicious mail?

31:34.936 --> 31:37.417
Something that might look
similar to this letter here.

31:41.900 --> 31:43.945
I remember an
envelope just like this.

31:47.514 --> 31:49.385
I didn't open it, though.

31:49.472 --> 31:51.474
What do you mean?

31:51.561 --> 31:55.304
The letter,
I, I never opened it.

31:55.391 --> 31:57.306
We got a
case at the <i>Post.</i>

31:57.393 --> 31:59.569
A woman with a cutaneous
wound on her finger.

31:59.656 --> 32:01.658
And I just got word that
Dan Rather's assistant over

32:01.745 --> 32:04.139
at CBS tested positive.

32:04.226 --> 32:05.836
<i>RYKER : </i>
She noticed the lesion
a couple of days ago.

32:05.924 --> 32:07.795
Did you find
any letters at CBS?

32:07.882 --> 32:09.971
No, but
we did find spores,

32:10.058 --> 32:11.625
some of them at Rather's desk.

32:11.712 --> 32:13.975
Look, uh, I'm at
<i>ABC News</i> right now.

32:14.062 --> 32:16.064
Um, I got a lot of
newsrooms to sweep.

32:16.151 --> 32:18.066
<i>RYKERS : What </i>
about you? What's your status?

32:18.153 --> 32:20.373
I'm heading into the
mail facility in Trenton now.

32:20.460 --> 32:22.766
I'll let you know if the
postmark gets us anywhere.

32:22.853 --> 32:25.247
<i>RYKER : </i>
Good. Thanks.

32:25.334 --> 32:27.554
All right, uh...

32:27.641 --> 32:31.688
Rest assured, the tests
we will be performing
are just a precaution.

32:31.775 --> 32:34.996
Uh, several employees at
other news outlets have

32:35.083 --> 32:38.739
tested positive for anthrax,
so we wanna make sure that

32:38.826 --> 32:42.177
everyone here at
<i>ABC News</i> is safe.

32:42.264 --> 32:44.223
Special Agent Ryker.

32:44.310 --> 32:46.877
As Assistant Director
Copak may have mentioned,

32:46.965 --> 32:49.532
we will need to know the names
of anyone who came to visit

32:49.619 --> 32:51.752
you here at work over
the past two weeks.

32:54.624 --> 32:57.279
Everyone, please, please,
let's, let's stay calm.

33:03.285 --> 33:04.330
<i>WOMAN : </i>
Hey, honey.

33:04.417 --> 33:05.809
Is he any worse?

33:05.896 --> 33:08.203
Getting pretty fussy.

33:08.290 --> 33:12.033
He's, he's little owie
is looking kind of ugly.

33:16.037 --> 33:18.605
Is everything okay?

33:19.998 --> 33:21.651
Excuse me, ma'am.

33:21.738 --> 33:22.652
Hi, my name is Agent Moore.

33:22.739 --> 33:24.350
I'm with the FBI.

33:24.437 --> 33:25.394
Uh, I'm just looking
for your floor manager.

33:25.481 --> 33:26.613
Uh, Quinton?

33:26.700 --> 33:28.180
What'd he get himself into?

33:28.267 --> 33:29.746
Uh, no, he's
not in any trouble.

33:29.833 --> 33:31.270
I just got a couple
of questions for him.

33:31.357 --> 33:34.012
Quinton!
Feds are looking for ya!

33:36.057 --> 33:37.232
He's right in there.

33:37.319 --> 33:39.452
Thanks.

33:43.021 --> 33:45.849
- You see these
hash marks down here?
- Right.

33:45.936 --> 33:47.721
That big metal
beast out there doing all the

33:47.808 --> 33:49.766
clanking stamps the code,
then sends it on down the line

33:49.853 --> 33:51.855
to the others to be
sorted accordingly.

33:51.942 --> 33:54.945
Okay.
Meaning the code then
serves as a, sort of,

33:55.033 --> 33:56.860
road map for
the letter's journey?

33:56.947 --> 33:59.559
Uh, this one, after
leaving here was dispatched to

33:59.646 --> 34:02.083
our route that covers 30 Rock.

34:02.170 --> 34:03.911
Okay.

34:03.998 --> 34:06.044
And where might the letter
been dropped off before it

34:06.131 --> 34:08.307
made its way to this facility?

34:08.394 --> 34:10.222
Could have been
any box in our region.

34:10.309 --> 34:12.702
One of our blue boxes,
if I had to guess.

34:12.789 --> 34:14.530
Blue boxes?

34:14.617 --> 34:17.316
Okay. How many of those
blue boxes are we talking?

34:17.403 --> 34:19.100
Over 600.

34:42.341 --> 34:44.212
Thought you
went home already?

34:46.214 --> 34:48.260
Got called back in. You?

34:48.347 --> 34:50.479
Yeah. Same.

34:50.566 --> 34:52.046
You know, I'm
practically drowning in

34:52.133 --> 34:54.222
samples that need testing,
and now word is,

34:54.309 --> 34:57.007
we're about to get new spores
from the New York letter.

34:57.095 --> 34:59.575
How much you wanna bet if
it turns out to be Ames just

34:59.662 --> 35:01.142
like the Florida strain.

35:01.229 --> 35:03.144
You sound
pretty confident.

35:03.231 --> 35:04.841
Well, you wanna
know what worries me?

35:04.928 --> 35:08.758
If it is Ames, only
advanced labs have it.

35:14.373 --> 35:16.201
Then how'd
Al-Qaeda get ahold of it?

35:16.288 --> 35:18.246
Exactly.

35:22.032 --> 35:24.905
This thing, this
thing could get messy.

35:37.787 --> 35:39.006
You heading out?

35:39.093 --> 35:40.616
Yeah.

35:40.703 --> 35:43.315
I just have some
things to finish up first.

35:43.402 --> 35:48.407
Well, suit yourself.

35:48.494 --> 35:49.451
Goodnight, Bruce.

35:49.538 --> 35:50.757
Good night.

36:35.584 --> 36:37.151
DOCTOR:
We tried administrating
oral antibiotics but

36:37.238 --> 36:39.240
little Joey keeps
spitting them up.

36:39.327 --> 36:41.373
We're running out of options.

36:41.460 --> 36:43.592
How long has the
infection been active?

36:43.679 --> 36:46.160
I can't tell you
any more than the father did.

36:46.247 --> 36:49.032
He said his wife and
the baby came by the
office a few days ago.

36:49.119 --> 36:51.470
We don't have many options
to stave off the spread of

36:51.557 --> 36:53.123
the infection in an infant.

36:53.211 --> 36:54.908
Anthrax isn't
something you stave off.

36:54.995 --> 36:56.562
If it's already systemic,

36:56.649 --> 36:58.216
which this is, this
boy needs to be on Cipro.

36:58.303 --> 36:59.695
I told you,
he can't keep them down.

36:59.782 --> 37:01.175
No, no,
not oral, intravenously.

37:01.262 --> 37:02.916
It's his only shot.

37:03.003 --> 37:05.571
Agent, this
is my ICU, my call.

37:05.658 --> 37:08.443
Do not mistake this
update as anything more than

37:08.530 --> 37:10.445
a professional courtesy.

37:10.532 --> 37:12.708
Before today, I was one
of only a handful of people in

37:12.795 --> 37:15.755
this country to have ever seen
a case of anthrax in a human.

37:15.842 --> 37:18.192
And babies?

37:18.279 --> 37:21.021
Ever seen an anthrax case
in an infant before?

37:21.108 --> 37:22.849
You wanna take a guess at the
odds of a human weighing less

37:22.936 --> 37:26.461
than 20 pounds surviving
that much Cipro intravenously?

37:26.548 --> 37:28.463
Is it better than zero?

37:28.550 --> 37:31.553
Because those are Joey's odds
if we don't kill the anthrax.

37:38.386 --> 37:40.127
Oh, you're up late.

37:40.214 --> 37:42.956
Correction,
I'm up early.

37:43.043 --> 37:45.480
You, my friend, are
the one that's up late.

37:45.567 --> 37:48.353
Well,
you know, can't sleep.

37:48.440 --> 37:50.920
<i>WILLIS : </i>
What's new? So
I got your text.

37:51.007 --> 37:53.793
So, what's got
you up before the dawn?

37:53.880 --> 37:57.405
<i>WILLIS : </i>
The Patriot Act Bill,
has everyone on Capitol Hill

37:57.492 --> 37:59.320
<i>scrambling right now.</i>

37:59.407 --> 38:00.887
You know, half the
groups I lobby for don't even

38:00.974 --> 38:03.585
know which way they
want this vote to go.

38:03.672 --> 38:05.674
Turns out that allowing
the FBI to freely spy on

38:05.761 --> 38:08.808
Americans makes
some folks uneasy.

38:10.244 --> 38:12.072
You know
this isn't public,

38:12.159 --> 38:15.641
but the anthrax we found,
all signs point to it leading

38:15.728 --> 38:18.034
back to Florida.

38:18.121 --> 38:19.862
<i>WILLIS : </i>
Well, you're afraid
that'd be the case.

38:19.949 --> 38:21.255
Only it's worse.

38:21.342 --> 38:23.692
Several victims.

38:23.779 --> 38:25.825
One's an infant.

38:25.912 --> 38:29.176
Jesus, Matthew.

38:29.263 --> 38:31.221
<i>WILLIS : </i>
I know word around D.C.

38:31.309 --> 38:34.050

38:34.137 --> 38:35.704
<i>Is that what you're thinking?</i>

38:35.791 --> 38:38.925
Well, Al-Qaeda
declared war on 9/11.

38:39.012 --> 38:41.797
No reason to think they'd
stop with the first strike.

38:52.286 --> 38:55.855
<i>WILLIS : </i>
You still there?

38:55.942 --> 38:57.291
<i>Matthew?</i>

38:57.378 --> 39:00.555
Uh, yeah,
I'm still here.

39:00.642 --> 39:05.255
Uh, why don't we talk more
once I get back to D.C., okay?

39:05.343 --> 39:07.606
<i>WILLIS : </i>
Yeah, sure.

39:07.693 --> 39:09.129
<i>Call me when you land.</i>

40:31.124 --> 40:36.303
Bruce, do you suspect
someone at work is possibly
involved?

40:41.047 --> 40:42.788
The other night I
swabbed a few places around

40:42.875 --> 40:46.008
USAMRIID looking for
something peculiar.

40:46.095 --> 40:47.793
Peculiar, meaning?

40:47.880 --> 40:50.273
Connected to the
anthrax attacks obviously.

40:52.188 --> 40:54.147
And?

40:56.192 --> 40:57.933
Inconclusive.

41:01.067 --> 41:06.333
Bruce, at minimum,
this is a massive burden

41:06.420 --> 41:08.466
you've taken upon yourself,

41:08.553 --> 41:11.077
and worst case a matter
of National Security.

41:11.164 --> 41:13.383
Yes, I'm aware.

41:13.471 --> 41:15.864
Have you considered
as a means of lifting this

41:15.951 --> 41:17.997
burden contacting
the authorities?

41:18.084 --> 41:19.215
Possibly the FBI?

41:19.302 --> 41:20.782
What if I'm wrong?

41:20.869 --> 41:22.262
What if this
colleague is innocent,

41:22.349 --> 41:23.655
I could destroy
his entire world.

41:26.266 --> 41:27.310
No.

41:29.443 --> 41:31.184
Not without
something concrete.

41:32.838 --> 41:34.840
HALSTROM:
I understand your trepidation.

41:34.927 --> 41:37.886
Will you at least
consider it, please?

41:49.942 --> 41:52.248
No need to wait
around on our account.

41:52.335 --> 41:54.163
I was just
heading to the field office.

41:54.250 --> 41:56.426
I thought I'd stop by
and check in on your son.

42:02.824 --> 42:04.957
Doctors
still won't say much.

42:05.044 --> 42:08.743
Though from what
they have said,

42:08.830 --> 42:10.832
it sounds like making
it through the night was

42:10.919 --> 42:13.966
a pretty major milestone.

42:14.053 --> 42:16.098
So, thank you for that.

42:16.185 --> 42:17.535
No need to thank me.

42:17.622 --> 42:19.624
- I didn't do any.
- Don't.

42:19.711 --> 42:21.190
The pediatrician said
you talked him into

42:21.277 --> 42:23.889
the intravenous treatment.

42:23.976 --> 42:25.412
I'm happy to help.

42:30.156 --> 42:31.505
Excuse me.

42:33.725 --> 42:36.118
Dr. Layton?

42:36.205 --> 42:37.946
<i>LAYTON : </i>
Hey, our teams got
their hands on that letter

42:38.033 --> 42:40.166
<i>that infected the </i>
woman at the Post.

42:40.253 --> 42:42.081
Here's
the troubling thing,

42:42.168 --> 42:43.517
the letter is still sealed.

42:43.604 --> 42:45.258
No one opened it,

42:45.345 --> 42:47.695
not even ripped a
corner or something?

42:47.782 --> 42:49.523
No.

42:49.610 --> 42:51.699
The powder must've worked
its way around the seal.

42:51.786 --> 42:54.136
The things is we've been
operating under the assumption

42:54.223 --> 42:57.139
that just a few spores
couldn't infect anyone.

43:00.447 --> 43:02.884
<i>MILLER : </i>
To know how to do this,

43:02.971 --> 43:05.670
<i>make sure that </i>
they don't link up with
people like Osama bin Laden

43:05.757 --> 43:08.542
<i>uh, for not panicking </i>
in the situation.

43:08.629 --> 43:10.979
<i>I think most of what </i>
we're going to see will...

43:11.066 --> 43:13.634
Hey, any
leads on the letter?

43:13.721 --> 43:16.419
Not yet.
It's with the CDC now.

43:16.506 --> 43:18.291
Get a load of this.

43:18.378 --> 43:20.946
News got their hands on some
tidbit and it's blowing up

43:21.033 --> 43:23.644
all over the airwaves.

43:23.731 --> 43:26.734
<i>KING : </i>
Should we be concerned that
Iraq may be able to do that?

43:26.821 --> 43:29.824
<i>MILLER : </i>
I have always been
concerned about Iraq.

43:29.911 --> 43:34.263
<i>I share the </i>
concern about Iraq's
biological weapons program.

43:34.350 --> 43:37.353
<i>Uh, I found it very curious </i>
indeed that Saddam Hussein...

43:37.440 --> 43:39.138
Iraq?

43:39.225 --> 43:42.315
No, no, this is,
I've had a couple of calls

43:42.402 --> 43:45.753
from Washington already.

43:45.840 --> 43:47.929
Fumbled my way through.

43:48.016 --> 43:49.931
It's like talking to people
about a party they think

43:50.018 --> 43:51.759
you were invited to.

43:51.846 --> 43:54.632
Is Al-Qaeda even in Iraq?

43:54.719 --> 43:58.200
Iraq's bioweapons
capabilities were shut
down after the war.

43:58.287 --> 44:00.550
As far as you
and I have been told.

44:00.638 --> 44:02.204
<i>PRESIDENT BUSH : </i>
It's clear that, uh,

44:02.291 --> 44:07.035
<i>Mr. Bin Laden is a man </i>

Hey.

Hi.

44:39.328 --> 44:40.547
Who are
you calling, Bruce?

44:40.634 --> 44:42.680
Oh, just work stuff.

44:42.767 --> 44:44.290
All right.

44:54.256 --> 44:57.869
In
five, four, three...

44:59.697 --> 45:01.263
Good evening.

45:01.350 --> 45:03.091
Tonight we find
ourselves in the unusual and

45:03.178 --> 45:07.487
unhappy position of
reporting on one of our own.

<i>REPORTER : </i>
Anthrax, war, terror and

45:09.663 --> 45:13.188

the USA is in an

45:13.275 --> 45:15.930
<i>understandable </i>
state of anxiety.

45:16.017 --> 45:18.541
<i>REPORTER 2 : </i>
It is concern in the county
about anthrax as a weapon.

45:18.628 --> 45:20.500
<i>REPORTER 3 : </i>
How does the FBI find out

45:20.587 --> 45:22.894
<i>who is responsible </i>
for sending out anthrax?

45:22.981 --> 45:25.113
<i>MAN : We don't have </i>
enough information to know

45:25.200 --> 45:27.507

related to terrorism.

45:27.594 --> 45:29.030

Reinforced by the President

45:29.117 --> 45:31.511
<i>that more terror </i>
attacks could be coming.

45:31.598 --> 45:34.166
<i>REPORTER 2 : </i>
In Rockefeller Center,
an anthrax case in NBC.

45:34.253 --> 45:36.995
<i>BROKAW : But NBC </i>
was not the only target.

45:37.082 --> 45:41.086
<i>Anthrax spores were also found </i>
on the desk of my colleague

<i>Dan Rather at CBS.</i>

45:43.566 --> 45:47.396
<i>Other news outlets including </i>
ABC and the New York Post were

45:47.483 --> 45:49.616
<i>targeted as well.</i>

45:49.703 --> 45:53.533
And today
anthrax attack victim
Robert Stevens was laid

45:53.620 --> 45:55.709
to rest in Florida.

45:55.796 --> 45:58.190
Our thoughts are
with his family.

45:58.277 --> 46:00.932
The other two original victims
from Florida are recovering.

46:02.934 --> 46:05.371
But now with multiple attacks
along the Eastern Seaboard and

46:05.458 --> 46:10.855
no suspect yet identified, our
nation is gripped with fear.

46:10.942 --> 46:13.771
We can only hope there
will be no more victims.
