SHE'S MY FRIEND.

07:53.291 --> 07:55.125
OH.

07:55.166 --> 07:57.917
I JUST FIGURED BEING AROUND HER
WOULD BE HARD FOR YOU,

07:57.959 --> 07:59.041
BECAUSE OF YOUR HISTORY.

07:59.083 --> 08:00.333
OH.

08:00.375 --> 08:02.041
NO.

08:02.083 --> 08:03.875
NO, I'M FINE.
IT'S--IT'S OKAY.

08:03.917 --> 08:05.041
GOOD.
MM.

08:05.083 --> 08:07.291
I'M GLAD. THAT'S GOOD.

08:07.333 --> 08:09.333
WHAT?

08:09.375 --> 08:10.542
NOTHING. I WAS JUST--

08:10.583 --> 08:13.166
I'M GLAD TO HEAR
YOU'RE DOING FINE.

08:15.625 --> 08:17.500
SO THEN...

08:17.542 --> 08:18.709
DO YOU EVER THINK ABOUT--

08:18.750 --> 08:21.166
I MEAN, NOT RIGHT NOW, BUT...

08:21.208 --> 08:23.041
DO YOU WANT TO HAVE KIDS?

08:23.083 --> 08:26.333
DR. PETERSON, YOU'VE GOT
A HEAD LAC IN CURTAIN TWO.

08:26.375 --> 08:27.542
BE RIGHT THERE.

08:27.583 --> 08:28.750
KEEP ME POSTED
ABOUT CHARLOTTE?

08:28.792 --> 08:31.000
SURE. YEAH.

08:33.667 --> 08:35.083
(laughter)

08:35.125 --> 08:38.041
I HAVE NEVER ONCE
HEARD HIM SAY "QUIET."

08:38.083 --> 08:39.083
IT'S ALWAYS "TACITURN."

08:39.125 --> 08:40.417
I CAUGHT HIM READING

08:40.458 --> 08:42.667
A DICTIONARY
IN HIS OFFICE ONCE. (laughing)

08:42.709 --> 08:44.041
(laughing)

08:44.083 --> 08:45.750
AN EXPANSIVE VOCABULARY IS
THE BEDROCK OF SAGACITY.

08:45.792 --> 08:49.041
YES, BUT IF YOU ACTUALLY
WANT PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND YOU,

08:49.083 --> 08:51.041
YOU MIGHT HAVE TO
DUMB IT DOWN A BIT.

08:51.083 --> 08:53.041
OOH. I LIKE HER,
SHELDON.

08:53.083 --> 08:54.417
WHERE'D YOU TWO MEET?

08:55.875 --> 08:57.041
AT A VENDING MACHINE.

08:57.083 --> 08:58.625
SHE WAS HAVING TROUBLE
WITH A CHOCOLATE BAR,

08:58.667 --> 09:00.834
AND I ASSISTED HER.

09:00.875 --> 09:02.041
THAT'S TRUE.

09:02.083 --> 09:06.375
HE WAS VERY CHIVALROUS
WITH SOME LOOSE CHANGE.

09:08.083 --> 09:09.375
THANK YOU.

09:09.417 --> 09:11.000
OH, LOOKS DELICIOUS.

09:12.625 --> 09:14.792
(Charlotte) TELL ME
WHAT I WANT TO HEAR.

09:14.834 --> 09:16.834
I KNOW THIS HAS BEEN
UNPLEASANT FOR YOU,

09:16.875 --> 09:19.041
BUT YOU ARE
IN THE HOME STRETCH,

09:19.083 --> 09:21.625
AND YOU'VE BEEN...
A REAL TROOPER

09:21.667 --> 09:23.041
THESE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS.

09:23.083 --> 09:24.166
I'VE BEEN A TROOPER?

09:24.208 --> 09:25.375
HONESTLY, NO.

09:25.417 --> 09:27.000
BUT I JUST WANTED TO SAY
SOMETHING NICE TO YOU.

09:27.041 --> 09:28.291
(chuckles)
YOU'RE AT 6 CENTIMETERS.

09:28.333 --> 09:31.041
UGH. I HATE YOU.

09:31.083 --> 09:32.375
HEY.

09:32.417 --> 09:34.166
SHOULDN'T YOU
BE GETTING HENRY READY?

09:34.208 --> 09:36.041
I CAN'T LEAVE YET.

09:36.083 --> 09:39.041
IT'S TODAY?

09:39.083 --> 09:41.208
HENRY'S ADOPTION HEARING?

09:41.250 --> 09:42.792
(scoffs)
WELL, GET THE HELL OUT.

09:42.834 --> 09:44.000
CHARLOTTE--

09:44.041 --> 09:45.417
DON'T "CHARLOTTE" ME.

09:45.458 --> 09:47.208
FIRST OF ALL, COOPER'S SPAWN
AREN'T ACTUALLY COMING OUT

09:47.250 --> 09:49.041
UNTIL HENRY'S
COLLEGE GRADUATION--

09:49.083 --> 09:51.041
CHARLOTTE, YOU ARE
HAVING YOUR BABIES.

09:51.083 --> 09:53.041
YOU ARE LEGALLY HAVING
YOUR OWN BABY TODAY, TOO.

09:53.083 --> 09:55.750
SO GO ON. SHOO.

09:55.792 --> 09:57.667
ALL RIGHT, BUT IF YOUR LABOR
STARTS TO PROGRESS

09:57.709 --> 09:58.875
MORE RAPIDLY--

09:58.917 --> 10:00.709
I'LL HAVE JAKE.

10:00.750 --> 10:03.041
YOU DIDN'T THINK YOU WERE
BOTH LEAVING, DID YOU?

10:03.083 --> 10:05.083
OF COURSE NOT.
I'M JUST GONNA--

10:05.125 --> 10:07.291
I'M GONNA WALK ADDISON OUT.

10:11.083 --> 10:14.875
SO NO SWINGS OR ICE CREAM
OR PICTURES WITH THE JUDGE.

10:14.917 --> 10:17.458
WELL, WE'LL GET THE BAILIFF TO
TAKE PICTURES WITH THE JUDGE,

10:17.500 --> 10:20.041
AND THERE WILL BE SWINGS
AND ICE CREAM, JUST LATER.

10:20.083 --> 10:23.083
LISTEN, YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW BADLY I WANTED TO BE THERE,

10:23.125 --> 10:24.709
BUT WE CAN'T--
WE CAN'T LEAVE CHARLOTTE

10:24.750 --> 10:26.083
WITH SOME POOR,
UNSUSPECTING DOCTOR.

10:26.125 --> 10:27.375
SHE'LL EAT 'EM ALIVE.

10:27.417 --> 10:29.166
I KNOW. I JUST--
I DON'T KNOW.

10:29.208 --> 10:31.500
I WAS JUST REALLY
LOOKING FORWARD TO CELEBRATING.

10:31.542 --> 10:33.583
WELL, LISTEN,
YOU AND HENRY AND I

10:33.625 --> 10:35.709
HAVE THE REST OF OUR LIVES
TO CELEBRATE.

10:35.750 --> 10:37.375
YOUR JOB RIGHT NOW
IS TO GO TO COURT

10:37.417 --> 10:39.500
AND BRING BACK OUR SON.

10:39.542 --> 10:41.041
JAKE...

10:41.083 --> 10:42.792
YOU JUST SAID "OUR SON."

10:42.834 --> 10:43.959
DAMN RIGHT, I DID.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.959
MM.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.083
GO.

10:47.125 --> 10:48.125
OKAY. OKAY.

10:48.166 --> 10:51.166
THANK YOU. MM.

10:54.792 --> 10:55.917
I SHOULDN'T BE SURPRISED
BY HIS QUESTION.

10:55.959 --> 10:57.375
(cooing)
I'M A WOMAN.

10:57.417 --> 11:00.000
I HAVE THE PLUMBING.

11:00.041 --> 11:02.375
I LOVE KIDS.

11:02.417 --> 11:03.792
(continues cooing)

11:03.834 --> 11:06.709
BUT WHAT IF MY BODY
ONLY MAKES BRAINLESS BABIES?

11:06.750 --> 11:08.542
(continues cooing)

11:08.583 --> 11:10.542
I COULDN'T
LIVE THROUGH THAT AGAIN.

11:10.583 --> 11:13.583
(continues cooing)

11:13.625 --> 11:17.125
AND EVEN IF I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH
TO HAVE A HEALTHY CHILD,

11:17.166 --> 11:19.000
I KNOW THINGS NOW.

11:20.208 --> 11:21.959
IT DOESN'T MATTER

11:22.000 --> 11:23.917
HOW FIERCELY YOU LOVE SOMEONE.

11:23.959 --> 11:25.750
IT'S NOT ENOUGH.

11:25.792 --> 11:28.041
THE WORLD CAN BE TERRIFYING,

11:28.083 --> 11:30.875
AND BAD THINGS HAPPEN THAT
YOU'RE POWERLESS TO PREVENT.

11:33.625 --> 11:35.583
I'M DONE.

11:35.625 --> 11:38.333
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE
ANY MORE BABIES.

11:38.375 --> 11:40.000
(continues cooing)

11:43.083 --> 11:44.166
(Charlotte) UGH.

11:44.208 --> 11:45.375
THEY ARE UNBELIEVABLE.

11:45.417 --> 11:46.792
TREATING MY UTERUS

11:46.834 --> 11:49.000
LIKE IT'S SOME KIND
OF AIRPORT V.I.P. LOUNGE.

11:49.041 --> 11:50.542
SO LET'S SEE
WHAT'S GOING ON.

11:50.583 --> 11:53.583
OH, I NEED SOME
GOOD NEWS, JAKE.

11:53.625 --> 11:56.041
ALL RIGHT.

11:56.083 --> 11:58.667
AND YOU'RE AT 7 CENTIMETERS.

11:58.709 --> 12:00.041
OH, NICE.
WE'RE GETTING CLOSER.

12:00.083 --> 12:02.959
CLOSER MY ASS.
COME ON. I'M DESPERATE.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.041
CAN'T YOU CHARM 'EM OUT
OR SOMETHIN'?

12:04.083 --> 12:06.792
THEY'RE GIRLS.
GIRLS LIKE YOU.

12:06.834 --> 12:08.375
JUST GET DOWN THERE AND SAY
WHATEVER IT IS YOU SAY TO WOMEN

12:08.417 --> 12:10.041
THAT GETS 'EM ALL
IN A TIZZY.

12:10.083 --> 12:11.041
(laughs)

12:11.083 --> 12:13.458
(sighs)

12:13.500 --> 12:16.667
YOUR BOYFRIEND'S LURKING.

12:16.709 --> 12:17.875
OH, GO.

12:17.917 --> 12:19.959
BUT BE BACK
IN 15 MINUTES.

12:22.667 --> 12:24.166
UNDERNEATH
THAT AWFUL EXTERIOR,

12:24.208 --> 12:26.875
YOU REALLY ARE JUST A SOFTIE,
AREN'T YOU?

12:26.917 --> 12:28.208
SHH.

12:28.250 --> 12:31.000
(lowered voice) IF THEY HEAR
YOU, THEY'LL NEVER MIND ME.

12:31.041 --> 12:33.625
(chart and pen clatter)

12:33.667 --> 12:34.834
OKAY.

12:34.875 --> 12:37.041
LOOK... I NEED YOU
ON YOUR BEST BEHAVIOR, OKAY?

12:37.083 --> 12:39.041
LOOK INTERESTED,
PAY ATTENTION,

12:39.083 --> 12:41.458
AND IF THE NICE LADY ASKS YOU
ANY QUESTIONS AT ALL, YOU--

12:41.500 --> 12:44.875
NO EYE ROLLING,
GRUNTING, OR NODDING.

12:46.083 --> 12:48.041
USE MY WORDS. I GOT THIS.

12:48.083 --> 12:49.083
OKAY, I KNOW YOU GOT IT.

12:49.125 --> 12:51.208
IT'S JUST--
I REALLY WANT TO WIN, OKAY?

12:51.250 --> 12:52.625
WE ARE GONNA WIN.

12:52.667 --> 12:54.792
WE'RE SO MUCH BETTER
THAN THE OTHER FAMILY.

12:57.083 --> 12:58.041
(Sam) OH, I FORGOT.

12:58.083 --> 12:59.250
(Stephanie) WHAT?

12:59.291 --> 13:00.542
YOU NEED TO...

13:00.583 --> 13:02.000
(laughs)

13:05.709 --> 13:07.041
(laughing)

13:07.083 --> 13:10.000
(laughing)

13:15.125 --> 13:17.792
OHH, MOTHER OF GOD.

13:17.834 --> 13:19.250
(crying)

13:19.291 --> 13:21.250
(panting)
THIS IS A BAD ONE.

13:21.291 --> 13:25.125
THIS IS, UH, THE DOUBLE PLATINUM
OF CONTRACTIONS.

13:25.166 --> 13:26.333
OTHERWISE,
I'D COME HELP YOU.

13:26.375 --> 13:29.000
I'M SORRY.
I SHOULD BE HELPING YOU.

13:29.041 --> 13:30.375
I JUST--
I NEEDED A PLACE TO HIDE.

13:30.417 --> 13:33.041
I CAN'T BE CRYING
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HOSPITAL.

13:33.083 --> 13:36.333
OH, IT'S MY HOSPITAL.
YOU CAN DO WHATEVER THE...

13:36.375 --> 13:38.709
OH! YOU CAN DO WHATEVER
YOU DAMN WELL PLEASE.

13:38.750 --> 13:39.917
OH.

13:39.959 --> 13:41.917
IT SHOULD BE OVER
IN THE NEXT MILLENNIUM,

13:41.959 --> 13:44.792
AND I'LL ASK YOU
WHAT'S WRONG.

13:44.834 --> 13:46.792
OH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.
I'M FINE. I'M OKAY.

13:46.834 --> 13:48.166
I JUST--I JUST CAN'T...

13:48.208 --> 13:49.583
(groaning)

13:49.625 --> 13:53.166
I JUST CAN'T STOP CRYING.

13:53.208 --> 13:56.792
WHY WON'T IT STOP?
(sobbing)

13:56.834 --> 14:00.250
I'VE BEEN ASKING MY UTERUS
THAT SAME THING, SISTER.

14:00.291 --> 14:01.792
AAH!

14:01.834 --> 14:04.667
(cries)

14:09.000 --> 14:10.542
HELLO THERE, YOUNG MAN.

14:10.583 --> 14:11.959
YOU MUST BE HENRY.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.917
(woman) HE IS, YOUR HONOR.

14:13.959 --> 14:15.625
AND THIS IS
DR. ADDISON FORBES MONTGOMERY,

14:15.667 --> 14:17.250
THE ADOPTIVE PARENT.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.041
OH, I SEE YOU WORK AT
ST. AMBROSE, DR. MONTGOMERY.

14:21.083 --> 14:22.834
THAT'S RIGHT.

14:22.875 --> 14:25.792
BUT NOT SO MUCH THAT IT WOULD
BE A PROBLEM FOR HENRY.

14:25.834 --> 14:28.166
I--SORRY. I'M... (laughs)
I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS.

14:28.208 --> 14:29.417
NO NEED.

14:29.458 --> 14:33.375
BIRTH MOTHER SIGNED AWAY
PARENTAL RIGHTS.

14:33.417 --> 14:36.000
HOME VISITS COMPLETED.

14:39.583 --> 14:41.375
WHAT'S GOING ON?

14:41.417 --> 14:42.792
YOUR HONOR?

14:42.834 --> 14:44.458
YOUR SOCIAL WORKER
MILDRED CLEMONS

14:44.500 --> 14:46.041
JUST FAXED THIS LETTER.

14:46.083 --> 14:47.959
IT SEEMS
SHE HAS SOME CONCERNS.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.875
WH-WHAT CONCERNS?
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

14:49.917 --> 14:51.041
I'M SORRY, DR. MONTGOMERY.

14:51.083 --> 14:53.083
I CAN'T FINALIZE
HENRY'S ADOPTION TODAY.

14:53.125 --> 14:55.083
I'M ORDERING
FURTHER EVALUATION.

14:55.125 --> 14:58.500
WE'LL SET ANOTHER COURT DATE,
AND I'LL MAKE A RULING THEN.

14:59.709 --> 15:02.417
WH-WH-WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

15:02.458 --> 15:03.625
I DON'T KNOW.

15:03.667 --> 15:05.625
NORMALLY THIS HEARING
IS A FORMALITY.

15:05.667 --> 15:07.834
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN
WITH MILDRED?

15:07.875 --> 15:09.917
NO, I HAVEN'T SEEN HER
IN MONTHS.

15:09.959 --> 15:12.041
WAS THERE ANYTHING UNUSUAL
ABOUT HER LAST VISIT?

15:12.083 --> 15:15.583
NO, NO. SHE--SHE JUST
MET WITH...

15:15.625 --> 15:16.792
JAKE.

15:16.834 --> 15:18.041
OKAY.

15:18.083 --> 15:19.291
I'LL TALK TO THE JUDGE

15:19.333 --> 15:20.917
AND TRY AND FIND OUT
EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON

15:20.959 --> 15:22.041
AND HOW WE SHOULD PROCEED.

15:22.083 --> 15:23.458
WAIT, WAIT.
IS THERE A CHANCE--

15:23.500 --> 15:25.625
I MEAN, COULD I...

15:25.667 --> 15:27.667
COULD I LOSE HENRY?

15:34.458 --> 15:36.709
TRY NOT TO GROW UP
TOO FAST, OKAY?

15:36.750 --> 15:38.667
BECAUSE LITTLE GIRLS
WHO GROW UP TOO FAST

15:38.709 --> 15:41.250
END UP RUNNING OFF WITH
THEIR COLLEGE PROFESSORS,

15:41.291 --> 15:44.458
WHICH YOU AND I BOTH KNOW
IS ENTIRELY INAPPROPRIATE.

15:44.500 --> 15:46.041
AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT

15:46.083 --> 15:48.041
CUTTING OFF COMMUNICATION
WITH YOUR FATHER

15:48.083 --> 15:50.417
BECAUSE HE SHOWED
A LITTLE CONCERN

15:50.458 --> 15:53.458
OVER YOUR EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING
IS, WELL...

15:53.500 --> 15:55.458
LET'S JUST SAY
I'LL BE RECOMMENDING

15:55.500 --> 15:58.041
A GOOD PRIVATE SCHOOL
TO YOUR MOM AND DAD--

15:58.083 --> 16:02.083
ONE WITH ONLY FEMALE TEACHERS,
POSSIBLY A CONVENT.

16:02.125 --> 16:04.250
(Cooper) IT REALLY IS
SUCH AN AMAZING HOME.

16:04.291 --> 16:06.333
I JUST WANT WHOEVER
LIVES HERE NEXT

16:06.375 --> 16:08.333
TO CHERISH THIS PLACE
LIKE WE DID,

16:08.375 --> 16:09.750
RESPECT ITS HISTORY.

16:09.792 --> 16:11.875
YEAH.
HISTORY'S
MY FAVORITE SUBJECT.

16:11.917 --> 16:14.041
DO YOU KNOW WHAT STARTED
WORLD WAR I?

16:14.083 --> 16:15.375
UH...

16:15.417 --> 16:17.166
(chuckles)

16:17.208 --> 16:19.792
THE ASSASSINATION
OF ARCHDUKE FERDINAND.

16:19.834 --> 16:22.166
AND HIS WIFE SOPHIE.
OH.

16:22.208 --> 16:23.750
YOU ARE SO DARLING.

16:23.792 --> 16:25.542
(chuckles)
(man) HELLO?

16:25.583 --> 16:27.166
YOO-HOO.
HI.

16:27.208 --> 16:28.583
(door closes)

16:28.625 --> 16:29.792
DAN AND DARLENE MEYER.

16:29.834 --> 16:31.041
I KNOW WE'RE EARLY,

16:31.083 --> 16:32.417
BUT WE GOT A CALL TO SERVE FOOD
AT THE MISSION LATER,

16:32.458 --> 16:33.834
AND WE JUST DIDN'T WANT
TO MISS THIS OPPORTUNITY.

16:33.875 --> 16:36.000
WE LOVE THIS HOUSE.
OHH.

16:36.041 --> 16:38.917
WELL, THIS IS DR. FREEDMAN

24:54.792 --> 24:58.041
HE WAS A GOOD DEAL MORE
THAN UPSET.

24:58.083 --> 25:00.000
IF THIS WAS AN ISSUE,

25:00.041 --> 25:02.000
WHY DIDN'T YOU
SAY SOMETHING SOONER?

25:04.208 --> 25:05.792
SEEING YOU WITH HENRY

25:05.834 --> 25:08.041
IS WHAT WE DREAM ABOUT
WHEN WE PLACE CHILDREN,

25:08.083 --> 25:10.041
SO I APPROVED THE ADOPTION.

25:10.083 --> 25:11.291
BUT AFTER MEETING DR. REILLY,

25:11.333 --> 25:14.041
I THOUGHT I COULD GET PAST
MY CONCERNS.

25:14.083 --> 25:15.834
I HAVE TO BE DISPASSIONATE

25:15.875 --> 25:17.709
AND CONSIDER
WHAT'S BEST FOR THE CHILD.

25:17.750 --> 25:19.041
I AM WHAT'S BEST
FOR HENRY.

25:19.083 --> 25:20.834
AND IF HENRY WERE LIVING
WITH YOU ALONE,

25:20.875 --> 25:23.625
I WOULDN'T HAVE
AN OBJECTION.

25:23.667 --> 25:26.041
(voice breaking) PLEASE.

25:26.083 --> 25:27.291
I CAN'T LOSE MY SON.

25:27.333 --> 25:29.041
I'M SORRY, DR. MONTGOMERY.

25:29.083 --> 25:31.542
I'VE ALREADY MADE
MY RECOMMENDATION.

25:31.583 --> 25:34.208
NOW IT'S UP TO THE JUDGE.

25:46.667 --> 25:47.959
"AND THE BRAVE PRINCE

25:48.000 --> 25:49.125
"MARRIED THE BEAUTIFUL
FAIRY PRINCESS,

25:49.166 --> 25:51.834
AND TOGETHER, THEY LIVED
HAPPILY EVER AFTER."

25:51.875 --> 25:53.041
(fusses)

25:53.083 --> 25:54.667
I KNOW.

25:54.709 --> 25:56.250
I SHOULD'VE READ THE BLUE ONE
ABOUT THE TRAINS.

25:56.291 --> 25:57.458
(cooing)

25:57.500 --> 25:59.333
FAIRY TALES ARE JUST...

25:59.375 --> 26:02.041
WELL, THEY'RE JUST STUPID,
YOU KNOW?

26:02.083 --> 26:04.166
AND PEOPLE SHOULD NOT
READ THEM TO THEIR CHILDREN.

26:04.208 --> 26:06.625
IT SETS THEM UP
FOR FALSE EXPECTATIONS.

26:06.667 --> 26:10.041
IT MAKES THEM THINK
THAT HAPPILY EVER AFTER

26:10.083 --> 26:11.250
IS THE END OF THE STORY.

26:11.291 --> 26:13.417
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT,
YOU KNOW? (chuckles)

26:13.458 --> 26:16.083
REAL RELATIONSHIP STORIES...

26:16.125 --> 26:17.917
ARE MESSY.

26:17.959 --> 26:21.041
REAL RELATIONSHIP STORIES
SOMETIMES HAVE A DEAD PRINCE

26:21.083 --> 26:25.417
AND A GRIEVING PRINCESS
WHO SOBS IN PUBLIC.

26:25.458 --> 26:28.166
AND THEY DON'T END.

26:28.208 --> 26:30.041
SAM SAYS THERE'S NO ENDING,

26:30.083 --> 26:32.000
AND I CHOOSE TO BELIEVE HIM

26:32.041 --> 26:35.959
BECAUSE A DEAD PRINCE
CAN'T BE THE ENDING.

26:36.000 --> 26:39.000
(fussing)

26:43.083 --> 26:45.333
GOD, YOU ARE SO TINY.

26:45.375 --> 26:49.625
I HOPE YOU NEVER KNOW
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

26:49.667 --> 26:52.333
(whispers) I HOPE
YOU NEVER HAVE A DEAD PRINCE.

26:52.375 --> 26:55.291
(continues fussing)

26:57.375 --> 26:59.125
(grunts) AH!

26:59.166 --> 27:00.500
OH!

27:00.542 --> 27:02.041
IF YOU TELL ME
I'M STILL AT 7 CENTIMETERS,

27:02.083 --> 27:03.291
I SWEAR, I'LL KILL YOU.

27:03.333 --> 27:05.208
NOPE, YOU'RE AT 10.
PAGE ADDISON, PLEASE.

27:05.250 --> 27:06.417
YOU GOT IT.

27:06.458 --> 27:09.333
(panting) WAIT.
THIS IS IT?

27:09.375 --> 27:11.166
YEP.
IF YOU FEEL LIKE IT...

27:11.208 --> 27:12.917
AH!
YOU CAN START TO PUSH.

27:12.959 --> 27:15.500
OH, I CAN'T. I NEED COOP.
AMELIA...

27:15.542 --> 27:16.709
I KNOW.

27:16.750 --> 27:17.917
(chuckles) THEY'RE COMING.
I KNOW.

27:17.959 --> 27:19.041
(laughs)

27:19.083 --> 27:21.000
OH, WHERE THE FREAKIN' HELL
IS MY HUSBAND?

27:21.041 --> 27:22.166
I'LL FIND HIM.

27:22.208 --> 27:24.792
OH. (inhales and hums)

27:24.834 --> 27:27.125
RIGHT FROM THAT FIRST DAY,
I KNEW THAT DARLENE

27:27.166 --> 27:29.792
WAS THE WOMAN I WANTED TO
SPEND THE REST OF MY LIFE WITH.

27:29.834 --> 27:31.041
(Darlene laughs)

27:31.083 --> 27:32.542
DR. FREEDMAN,
WHERE DID YOU MEET YOUR WIFE?

27:32.583 --> 27:34.125
WASN'T IT ON A WEB SITE?

27:34.166 --> 27:35.750
NO.

27:35.792 --> 27:37.083
NO, WE MET
AT ST. AMBROSE HOSPITAL,

27:37.125 --> 27:39.333
WHERE SHE IS CHIEF OF STAFF.

27:39.375 --> 27:41.125
(Dan) HMM,
THAT CAN'T BE EASY.

27:41.166 --> 27:43.000
THERE'S SO MUCH BUREAUCRACY
IN THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE.

27:43.041 --> 27:44.750
YEAH, AND PRICE GOUGING.
(chuckles)

27:44.792 --> 27:46.041
PRICE GOUGING?

27:46.083 --> 27:47.291
WELL, I'M SORRY, DR. FREEDMAN.

27:47.333 --> 27:49.041
MOST PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD
ANY KIND OF MEDICAL CARE.

27:49.083 --> 27:51.208
WELL, I TREAT MY PATIENTS
REGARDLESS.

27:51.250 --> 27:53.208
BUT YOU DON'T PRACTICE
FOR FREE, RIGHT?

27:53.250 --> 27:54.500
WELL, I SAVE CHILDREN.

27:54.542 --> 27:56.125
(cell phone vibrates)
UH, WOULD YOU LIKE

27:56.166 --> 27:57.542
TO HEAR ABOUT THE SCHOOLS
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD?
(beep)

27:57.583 --> 27:59.834
AMELIA.

27:59.875 --> 28:02.000
OKAY. WE'RE ON OUR WAY.
WE GOTTA GO.

28:02.041 --> 28:03.125
BUT WE'RE TOTALLY WINNING.

28:03.166 --> 28:04.542
SORRY.

28:04.583 --> 28:06.625
UM, LOOK, I...

28:06.667 --> 28:08.959
REALLY WANT TO BUY THIS HOUSE
FOR MY WIFE AS A SURPRISE

28:09.000 --> 28:11.041
BECAUSE I LOVE IT,
SHE WOULD LOVE IT.

28:11.083 --> 28:13.125
AND SHE'S BEEN THROUGH SO MUCH
AND SHE REALLY DESERVES IT.

28:13.166 --> 28:15.417
AND MASON AND MY GIRLS, THEY
COULD HAVE A HAPPY LIFE HERE.

28:15.458 --> 28:17.542
BUT AS MUCH AS I WANT TO LIVE
IN THIS AMAZING HOUSE,

28:17.583 --> 28:19.041
I CANNOT BE HERE RIGHT NOW,

28:19.083 --> 28:22.458
UM, BECAUSE MY WIFE
IS IN LABOR WITH TRIPLETS,

28:22.500 --> 28:24.583
AND I HAVE TO BE THERE
WITH HER, OKAY?

28:24.625 --> 28:26.375
SO I MEAN,
FAMILY IS EVERYTHING.

28:26.417 --> 28:28.375
IF WE END UP LIVING
IN A TENT BY THE STREAM,

28:28.417 --> 28:30.959
AS LONG AS WE'RE TOGETHER,
IT'S GONNA BE FINE.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.917
SO IT WAS NICE TO MEET YOU...
BUT WE GOTTA GO.

28:35.083 --> 28:37.250
(door opens)

28:37.291 --> 28:38.959
(door closes)

28:39.000 --> 28:41.542
HEY THERE. YOU FEEL LIKE
HAVING SOME BABIES?

28:41.583 --> 28:43.959
NO. NOT WITHOUT COOPER.
HE'S ON HIS WAY.

28:44.000 --> 28:45.041
SO HOW'D IT GO?

28:45.083 --> 28:46.959
WAS IT, UH,
WAS IT AMAZING?

28:47.000 --> 28:48.041
IT WAS FINE.

28:48.083 --> 28:50.000
YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE
IT WAS FINE.

28:50.041 --> 28:51.625
WELL, I HAVE TWO BABIES
TO DELIVER,

28:51.667 --> 28:53.917
SO IF YOU COULD MOVE...

28:53.959 --> 28:56.583
OKAY.

28:56.625 --> 28:59.041
OH, YEAH. THESE BABIES AREN'T
WAITING FOR THEIR DADDY.

28:59.083 --> 29:00.542
I NEED COOPER.
WELL, YOU'RE GONNA FEEL BETTER

29:00.583 --> 29:02.041
ONCE YOU START PUSHING,
CHARLOTTE.

29:02.083 --> 29:03.041
NO, I CAN'T DO IT
WITHOUT HIM.

29:03.083 --> 29:05.709
SORRY. SORRY. SORRY. SORRY.
TOTALLY EXPLAIN.

29:05.750 --> 29:07.083
SHUT THE HELL UP
AND HOLD MY HAND.

29:07.125 --> 29:08.375
THANK GOD.
MY HAND IS NUMB. (exhales)

29:08.417 --> 29:10.625
ALL RIGHTY. HERE WE GO.
GIVE ME A PUSH.

29:10.667 --> 29:12.125
AAH!

29:13.875 --> 29:15.417
CHARLOTTE'S DELIVERING, HUH?

29:15.458 --> 29:17.208
FINALLY. (chuckles)

29:17.250 --> 29:21.041
SHE'S BEEN RUNNING STEPHANIE
RAGGED ALL DAY.

29:21.083 --> 29:23.250
(chuckles)

29:23.291 --> 29:25.542
SO YOU AND STEPHANIE
ARE BACK ON, HUH?

29:25.583 --> 29:26.750
YEAH.

29:26.792 --> 29:30.041
YEAH. WELL, GOOD.
GOOD FOR YOU.

29:30.083 --> 29:31.667
I'M SEEING SOMEONE, TOO.

29:31.709 --> 29:33.083
HER NAME IS MIRANDA.

29:33.125 --> 29:35.041
OH, THAT'S GREAT, SHELDON.

29:35.083 --> 29:36.125
YEAH.

29:36.166 --> 29:38.250
ALL RIGHT.

29:38.291 --> 29:40.959
I MET HER AT RADIATION.

29:41.000 --> 29:42.417
I DID
EIGHT WEEKS OF TREATMENT.

29:42.458 --> 29:43.834
NOW I GOTTA WAIT
ANOTHER SIX MONTHS

29:43.875 --> 29:46.333
BEFORE I KNOW IF IT WORKS,
BUT, UH...

29:46.375 --> 29:48.875
I'M HOPEFUL.

29:48.917 --> 29:50.875
HOW YOU FEELING?

29:50.917 --> 29:54.000
PRETTY GOOD FOR A GUY WHOSE
PROSTATE GLOWS IN THE DARK.

29:57.625 --> 29:59.500
WELL, I'M GLAD
YOU GOT TREATMENT.

29:59.542 --> 30:01.500
YEAH, I HAVE A FRIEND
WHO WAS A REAL PAIN IN THE ASS

30:01.542 --> 30:03.041
ABOUT IT.

30:03.083 --> 30:06.542
SO ANYWAY, UH...

30:06.583 --> 30:08.000
THANK YOU.

30:12.083 --> 30:14.000
(Charlotte) OHH.

30:14.041 --> 30:15.250
OKAY, CHARLOTTE,
I NEED YOU TO PUSH.

30:15.291 --> 30:18.291
(groaning)

30:18.333 --> 30:19.500
GOOD.
ALMOST THERE.

30:19.542 --> 30:21.000
GET THEM OUT!

30:21.041 --> 30:22.041
YOU'RE SO CLOSE.

30:22.083 --> 30:23.458
OH, DON'T TELL ME I'M CLOSE

30:23.500 --> 30:25.792
WHEN I STILL GOT
TWO BABIES INSIDE ME.

30:25.834 --> 30:27.875
ALL RIGHT, CHARLOTTE,
I NEED YOU TO KEEP PUSHING.

30:27.917 --> 30:29.333
NOW FOCUS.
(inhales deeply)

30:29.375 --> 30:32.750
AAH!

30:32.792 --> 30:34.750
(Addison) GOOD.
(whimpers)

30:34.792 --> 30:37.125
(baby crying)

30:37.166 --> 30:39.041
OHH. OHH.

30:39.083 --> 30:41.166
(crying continues)

30:41.208 --> 30:43.542
SHE'S CRYING.

30:43.583 --> 30:46.041
(cries) SHE'S OKAY?

30:46.083 --> 30:47.208
SHE'S PERFECT.

30:47.250 --> 30:48.917
(laughs)

30:48.959 --> 30:52.333
(crying continues)

30:52.375 --> 30:53.583
(panting)

30:53.625 --> 30:55.333
(laughs)

30:57.792 --> 30:59.125
IF THIS IS, UH,

30:59.166 --> 31:00.875
IF THIS IS TOO HARD
FOR YOU...

31:00.917 --> 31:02.417
(voice breaking) NO.

31:02.458 --> 31:03.792
IT'S AMAZING.

31:03.834 --> 31:05.041
(baby crying)

31:05.083 --> 31:06.125
AAH!

31:06.166 --> 31:07.208
OHH!

31:07.250 --> 31:09.166
SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT.

31:09.208 --> 31:10.375
ADDISON, TALK TO ME.

31:10.417 --> 31:11.458
I CAN'T FEEL THE HEAD.

31:11.500 --> 31:13.041
(panting)

31:13.083 --> 31:14.375
IS SHE IN BREECH?

31:14.417 --> 31:16.583
NO, SHE'S NOT UPSIDE DOWN.
SHE'S SIDEWAYS.

31:16.625 --> 31:18.041
(Cooper) CAN YOU JUST DO
A C-SECTION?

31:18.083 --> 31:19.750
IT IS AN OPTION,
BUT I STILL FEEL LIKE

31:19.792 --> 31:21.875
I CAN DELIVER VAGINALLY.

31:21.917 --> 31:23.458
THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT RISKS.
THE BABY IS TRANSVERSE.

31:23.500 --> 31:25.250
YEAH, BUT THERE'S RISKS
WITH ANY PROCEDURE,

31:25.291 --> 31:26.875
INCLUDING C-SECTION.

31:26.917 --> 31:28.041
LOOK, CHARLOTTE, YOUR BODY'S
BEEN THROUGH ENOUGH TRAUMA

31:28.083 --> 31:29.250
AND SO HAVE THE BABIES.

31:29.291 --> 31:30.458
I STILL THINK I CAN DELIVER

31:30.500 --> 31:32.041
BY DOING
AN INTERNAL PODALIC VERSION.

31:32.083 --> 31:33.333
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

31:33.375 --> 31:34.750
SHE ROTATES THE BABY
UNTIL SHE CAN GRAB A FOOT,

31:34.792 --> 31:36.417
AND THEN SHE DELIVERS HER
AS A BREECH.

31:36.458 --> 31:38.792
WAIT. IS THAT... I MEAN,
CAN YOU EVEN DO THAT?

31:38.834 --> 31:40.375
YES, COOPER. I CAN DO IT.
AND IS IT SAFE?

31:40.417 --> 31:42.166
COOPER, YOU KNOW THEY COULDN'T
BE IN BETTER HANDS.

31:42.208 --> 31:44.291
CHARLOTTE, IT'S EASIER
ON YOUR BODY THAN SURGERY

31:44.333 --> 31:47.291
AND IT WON'T TAKE VERY LONG,
BUT IT'S GONNA HURT LIKE HELL.

31:47.333 --> 31:49.208
OKAY. JUST GET ON WITH IT.

31:49.250 --> 31:50.625
YEAH? ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GET HER READY.

31:50.667 --> 31:51.834
(Stephanie) OKAY.
I'LL STABILIZE HER LEGS.

31:51.875 --> 31:53.458
OKAY, NOW YOU CAN'T PUSH
UNTIL I TELL YOU,

31:53.500 --> 31:55.041
BUT YOU CAN SCREAM.

31:55.083 --> 31:56.041
AND YOU CAN SQUEEZE.

31:56.083 --> 31:57.834
ALL RIGHT?
SO ON THE COUNT OF THREE.

31:57.875 --> 31:59.041
MM-HMM.

31:59.083 --> 32:01.041
ONE, TWO, THREE.

32:01.083 --> 32:02.041
SQUEEZE.

32:02.083 --> 32:04.709
(screaming)

32:04.750 --> 32:06.166
OH, GOD!

32:06.208 --> 32:09.041
OHH! (whimpers)

32:12.500 --> 32:14.041
AAH!

32:14.083 --> 32:15.333
AAH!
ALMOST THERE.

32:15.375 --> 32:16.458
ALMOST THERE.

32:16.500 --> 32:18.041
I CAN'T. IT'S TOO MUCH.

32:18.083 --> 32:19.500
OKAY, LISTEN TO ME.
LISTEN TO ME.

32:19.542 --> 32:21.041
YOU CAN DO THIS, OKAY?
YOU CAN.

32:21.083 --> 32:22.959
I JUST WANT IT TO BE OVER.
IT'S ABOUT TO BE OVER.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.959
YOU ARE SO STRONG.

32:25.000 --> 32:26.125
OUR GIRLS ARE GONNA BE
JUST LIKE YOU.

32:26.166 --> 32:27.709
SO COME ON. YOU GOTTA
DO THIS RIGHT NOW.

32:27.750 --> 32:29.083
YOUR LITTLE GIRL
WANTS TO MEET YOU, OKAY?

32:29.125 --> 32:30.875
OKAY. OKAY. I'VE GOT
THE BABY TURNED.

32:30.917 --> 32:32.250
JUST GIVE ME A PUSH NOW.

32:32.291 --> 32:34.333
AAH!

32:34.375 --> 32:36.083
GOOD. ALL RIGHT. STOP.
STOP. STOP. STOP. STOP.

32:36.125 --> 32:38.333
NO MORE PUSHING.
NO MORE PUSHING.
IS THAT GOOD?

32:38.375 --> 32:40.542
SHE'S GOT THE BODY, OKAY?
BUT THE HEAD IS STILL INSIDE.

32:40.583 --> 32:41.875
JUST GIVE HER A MINUTE,
OKAY?

32:41.917 --> 32:43.250
(crying)
PLEASE. I'M SO EXHAUSTED.

32:43.291 --> 32:45.792
I KNOW. I KNOW YOU ARE,
BUT YOU'RE ALMOST THERE.

32:45.834 --> 32:47.750
(Addison)
JUST A FEW MORE SECONDS.

32:47.792 --> 32:49.041
OKAY, NOW. PUSH.

32:49.083 --> 32:51.083
AAH!

32:51.125 --> 32:54.041
OKAY. OKAY. GOOD.
I GOT HER.

32:54.083 --> 32:55.250
(panting)

32:55.291 --> 32:57.041
OH, GOD.

32:57.083 --> 32:58.875
(speaks indistinctly)
HI.

32:58.917 --> 32:59.875
HI, BABY.

32:59.917 --> 33:01.125
LET ME SEE YOU.

33:01.166 --> 33:02.709
YOU WANT TO CUT
THE CORD, COOPER?
YEAH.

33:02.750 --> 33:04.875
HEY, SHE'S GOT YOUR EYES.

33:04.917 --> 33:07.125
(laughs) HI, SWEETHEART.

33:07.166 --> 33:08.333
HI. HI.

33:08.375 --> 33:09.750
HI, BABY GIRL.

33:09.792 --> 33:11.041
(crying)

33:11.083 --> 33:12.458
(Addison chuckles) OKAY.

33:12.500 --> 33:14.375
(laughs)

33:14.417 --> 33:15.542
OKAY.
LET ME TAKE HER AWAY NOW.

33:15.583 --> 33:17.166
(Charlotte) OH.
THERE WE GO.

33:17.208 --> 33:18.375
SHE WANTS HER MAMA.

33:18.417 --> 33:19.834
(laughs) YOU GOT HER?

33:19.875 --> 33:21.041

33:21.083 --> 33:22.792

33:22.834 --> 33:26.458

33:28.083 --> 33:29.959

33:31.959 --> 33:34.417
HEY.

33:34.458 --> 33:36.750
SO WHAT HAPPENED IN COURT?

33:38.083 --> 33:40.125
MILDRED HAPPENED.

33:40.166 --> 33:43.333
AT THE LAST MINUTE,
SHE DECIDED SHE COULDN'T...

33:44.875 --> 33:48.834
SHE DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT
ABOUT THE ADOPTION.

33:48.875 --> 33:51.041
WHAT? I-I THOUGHT THE HEARING
WAS JUST A FORMALITY.

33:51.083 --> 33:52.583
NOT ANYMORE.

33:52.625 --> 33:54.250
THE JUDGE DECIDED HE WANTED
TO DO FURTHER EVALUATION,

33:54.291 --> 33:57.208
AND THEN
HE'S GOING TO DECIDE...

33:57.250 --> 33:59.542
(voice breaks) WHETHER OR NOT
I GET TO KEEP MY SON.

33:59.583 --> 34:02.834
I-I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WHY WOULD SHE...

34:04.458 --> 34:06.583
OH, GOD. NO.

34:06.625 --> 34:08.417
IT'S--IT'S ME? MY ARREST.

34:08.458 --> 34:10.041
AND THE THING WITH ANGELA.

34:10.083 --> 34:12.041
(sighs deeply)
OH, ADDISON.

34:12.083 --> 34:14.959
I'M SO...

34:15.000 --> 34:17.625
I'M SO SORRY. HEY.

34:17.667 --> 34:19.583
DON'T. OKAY? I JUST--
RIGHT NOW, I-I CAN'T.

34:19.625 --> 34:22.250
I JUST--I KNOW THAT THIS IS--
THIS IS NOT YOUR FAULT.

34:22.291 --> 34:24.291
I KNOW THAT, BUT...

34:24.333 --> 34:28.625
THE JUDGE COULD TAKE HENRY
FROM ME, AND...

34:28.667 --> 34:30.709
(voice breaks)
I CAN'T.

34:40.083 --> 34:41.250
CHARLOTTE HAD THE BABIES.

34:41.291 --> 34:43.458
THAT'S GREAT.
IS EVERYBODY OKAY?

34:43.500 --> 34:45.583
THEY'RE AMAZING.

34:45.625 --> 34:48.834
(crying)
THEY'RE PERFECT.

34:48.875 --> 34:50.667
HEY, HEY, HEY. WH-WHAT'S--
WHAT'S GOING ON?

34:50.709 --> 34:52.291
YES.
WHAT?

34:52.333 --> 34:55.583
THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION
IS YES, I WANT BABIES.

34:55.625 --> 34:57.083
I WANT A LOT OF BABIES.

34:57.125 --> 34:59.208
AND I'M REALLY SCARED
TO WANT BABIES,

34:59.250 --> 35:01.667
SO I-I TOLD MYSELF
THAT I DIDN'T, BUT I DO.

35:03.542 --> 35:06.208
BECAUSE IT'S A MIRACLE.

35:06.250 --> 35:08.041
AND I REALLY...

35:08.083 --> 35:09.834
I REALLY A NEED MIRACLE.

35:09.875 --> 35:13.417
SO, YES, SOMEDAY I WANT
TO HAVE BABIES WITH YOU.

35:13.458 --> 35:15.083
SOMEDAY.

35:16.667 --> 35:18.500
IF WE GET THAT FAR.
(laughs)

35:18.542 --> 35:20.041
WE'LL GET THAT FAR.

35:20.083 --> 35:21.333
(exhales)

35:21.375 --> 35:23.000
(both laugh)

35:28.291 --> 35:29.625
YOU CAME BACK
FOR YOUR BASKET.

35:29.667 --> 35:30.834
I CAME BACK FOR MY BASKET.

35:30.875 --> 35:32.000
I'M GLAD.

35:34.750 --> 35:36.542
OH...

35:38.542 --> 35:39.709
WOW. (laughs)

35:39.750 --> 35:41.041
I ADDED SOME EXTRA BOOKS--
UH, NO CHARGE--

35:41.083 --> 35:42.291
JUST TO FILL IT OUT
A LITTLE BIT.

35:42.333 --> 35:44.667
AND THEN THERE'S SOME BOOKS
EVERY CHILD SHOULD HAVE,

35:44.709 --> 35:46.166
SO I THREW THOSE IN, TOO.

35:46.208 --> 35:49.041
YOU--YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO--
IT'S--IT'S BEAUTIFUL. THANKS.

35:49.083 --> 35:50.792
I FELT BAD.

35:50.834 --> 35:52.458
I MADE YOU FEEL SAD,
AND I DIDN'T MEAN TO.

35:52.500 --> 35:53.917
NO, NO, NO,
IT WASN'T YOU.

35:53.959 --> 35:55.125
IT WAS JUST...

35:55.166 --> 35:56.750
IT WAS ME.

35:56.792 --> 35:58.000
(clicks)

35:58.041 --> 35:59.166
OKAY.

35:59.208 --> 36:02.750
YOU WERE ACTUALLY
BEING REALLY KIND.

36:02.792 --> 36:05.166
SO WOULD YOU LIKE TO GET
A CUP OF COFFEE SOMETIME

36:05.208 --> 36:06.750
OR--OR A DRINK?

36:08.250 --> 36:10.375
I CAN'T GO OUT WITH YOU.

36:10.417 --> 36:11.709
I DON'T WANT TO.

36:11.750 --> 36:13.041
OKAY.

36:13.083 --> 36:14.417
I MEAN, NO, IT'S NOT YOU.
I MEAN, YOU'RE LOVELY.

36:14.458 --> 36:16.041
AND I THINK IF I WAS GONNA
GO OUT WITH ANYBODY,

36:16.083 --> 36:17.583
IT WOULD PROBABLY BE YOU,
BUT--

36:17.625 --> 36:19.041
BUT?

36:19.083 --> 36:22.208
BUT I'M--
I'M TRYING TO BE OKAY

36:22.250 --> 36:25.041
WITH JUST ME RIGHT NOW.

36:25.083 --> 36:26.959
AND I DON'T WANNA

36:27.000 --> 36:29.041

36:29.083 --> 36:30.083

36:30.125 --> 36:31.417

36:31.458 --> 36:33.041

36:33.083 --> 36:36.041

SO I UNDERSTAND PERFECTLY.

36:36.083 --> 36:37.875

36:54.083 --> 36:56.959

I JUST DECIDED.

36:57.000 --> 36:58.667
AND YOU HELPED ME DECIDE,
SO THANK YOU.

36:58.709 --> 37:00.041

JUDGE HARRIS, MY NAME
IS DR. JAKE REILLY.

37:23.125 --> 37:24.291
I'M ENGAGED TO--

37:24.333 --> 37:26.041
DR. ADDISON FORBES MONTGOMERY.

37:26.083 --> 37:27.875
I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

37:27.917 --> 37:29.458
AND I KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE.

37:29.500 --> 37:31.291
BUT I HAVEN'T MADE
MY DECISION.

37:31.333 --> 37:34.792
YOU CAN'T DECIDE WHAT'S BEST
FOR HENRY WITHOUT THE FACTS.

37:34.834 --> 37:37.041
I HAVE THEM,
IN A NICE BIG RED FILE.

37:37.083 --> 37:40.625
THAT'S NOT THE WHOLE STORY.

37:40.667 --> 37:43.333
YOU CAN ONLY GET THAT
FROM ME.

37:45.667 --> 37:46.875
30 SECONDS.

37:46.917 --> 37:50.500
LILY, MY WIFE, MY--
MY LATE WIFE, WAS AN ADDICT.

37:50.542 --> 37:53.875
SHE HAD A DAUGHTER--ANGELA--
WHO BECAME OUR DAUGHTER.

37:53.917 --> 37:57.250
LILY'S DEALER WAS
AS CLOSE TO THE DEVIL AS...

37:57.291 --> 37:59.291
HE WOULD KILL FOR MONEY.
HE WOULD--

37:59.333 --> 38:01.041
HE WOULD KILL FOR NOTHING.

38:01.083 --> 38:03.208
AND I HAD TO PROTECT
MY FAMILY,

38:03.250 --> 38:05.834
MY... MY CHILD.

38:05.875 --> 38:07.625
AND ALL THESE YEARS LATER?

38:07.667 --> 38:10.041
I'M STILL PROTECTING
MY CHILD.

38:10.083 --> 38:13.041
WHEN YOU HAVE A KID,
IT'S--IT'S FOR LIFE.

38:13.083 --> 38:14.750
DOESN'T MATTER
HOW OLD THEY ARE.

38:14.792 --> 38:17.125
I WAS TRYING
TO PROTECT ANGELA,

38:17.166 --> 38:20.667
AND I WOULD DO THE SAME
FOR HENRY.

38:20.709 --> 38:23.500
CONSIDER YOURSELF HEARD.

38:26.291 --> 38:28.875
I'LL LEAVE HER.

38:28.917 --> 38:31.458
ADDISON LOVES THAT BABY.
SHE...

38:31.500 --> 38:33.250
SHE LOVES HENRY MORE THAN
ANYTHING IN THE WORLD,

38:33.291 --> 38:35.083
AND I LOVE HER
MAYBE EVEN MORE THAN THAT,

38:35.125 --> 38:37.041
SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO
BREAK THEM APART,

38:37.083 --> 38:38.458
THEN I'LL LEAVE HER.

38:38.500 --> 38:40.041
I'LL WALK AWAY.

38:40.083 --> 38:42.041
BUT THEY
NEED TO BE TOGETHER.

38:42.083 --> 38:44.041
