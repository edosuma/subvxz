WEBVTT

02:51.882 --> 02:52.877
It's not here!

02:53.924 --> 02:57.206
- We can buy anything?
- Anything.

02:58.424 --> 03:01.375
- Stereo?
- Oh yeah. The finest.

03:02.049 --> 03:04.372
Quadrophonic, headphones--

03:04.674 --> 03:06.830
- Speakers?
- Oh yeah, speakers.

03:07.257 --> 03:10.042
I want all the speakers we can get.

03:10.341 --> 03:11.798
All right.

03:12.716 --> 03:14.457
And when the baby comes,

03:15.257 --> 03:18.255
I want flowers,
music boxes,

03:18.549 --> 03:20.623
and balloons, and butterflies...

03:20.924 --> 03:22.630
Great!

03:23.674 --> 03:25.297
And I want acid.

03:26.924 --> 03:30.254
So we can learn from the baby's wisdom.

03:30.632 --> 03:31.627
All right!

03:43.757 --> 03:47.253
You know what else I want?
I want a hang glider.

03:47.757 --> 03:51.123
And I want the baby to start
skydiving real early.

03:51.841 --> 03:55.965
And I also want
his face to be tattooed.

04:55.633 --> 04:57.837
Look, it's Ganesh!

04:58.508 --> 05:00.297
It's a sign from heaven.

06:17.867 --> 06:20.742
<i>Good-bye, little chicks
we are leaving the sticks</i>

06:20.783 --> 06:24.200
<i>We are catching the train
at a quarter to 6:00</i>

06:24.283 --> 06:27.825
<i>So if anyone should drop around</i>

06:27.908 --> 06:30.867
<i>Won't you please tell them
that we can be found</i>

06:30.950 --> 06:34.575
<i>On the boardwalk in Atlantic City</i>

06:34.617 --> 06:37.367
<i>We will walk in a dream</i>

06:37.450 --> 06:41.033
<i>On the boardwalk in Atlantic City</i>

06:41.117 --> 06:44.533
<i>Life will be peaches and cream</i>

06:44.617 --> 06:47.867
<i>There where there's
saltwater air</i>

06:47.950 --> 06:51.575
<i>Brings out the lady's charms</i>

06:51.658 --> 06:54.617
<i>There on the rolling chair</i>

06:54.700 --> 06:57.742
<i>He'll roll right into your arms</i>

07:19.342 --> 07:21.379
Excuse me, ma'am.
You can't bring those bang in here.

07:21.884 --> 07:25.332
- Oh, we're looking for Sally.
- It's hotel policy.

07:25.634 --> 07:27.957
She's a really great girl
who works here.

07:34.592 --> 07:36.464
Oh, Christ!

07:40.425 --> 07:43.376
Hi. Oh, wow,
it's really good to see you.

07:44.467 --> 07:46.837
I don't want you here.
Get your asses out of here.

07:47.550 --> 07:49.008
When do you finish?

07:49.592 --> 07:51.630
You're not staying with me.

07:53.300 --> 07:54.295
Look, Sally,

07:54.842 --> 07:56.383
we've got money.
- Great.

07:56.842 --> 07:58.632
You're in a hotel.
Check in.

07:59.175 --> 08:00.549
We will have money.

08:02.550 --> 08:04.127
Sally !

08:12.092 --> 08:14.462
- Can you spell me for an hour?
- Yeah, sure.

08:14.759 --> 08:17.461
- Who are they?
- My husband and my sister.

09:03.134 --> 09:04.792
We drove across Utah.

09:05.092 --> 09:08.090
You'd really love
those waterfalls there, Sally!

09:09.843 --> 09:11.335
And then Colorado.

09:11.634 --> 09:15.462
Did we ever meet some beautiful
Indians that live on a commune.

09:16.384 --> 09:19.051
Did they have
some dynamite mushrooms!

09:19.343 --> 09:21.463
Do you know
even the cows were wrecked?

09:22.009 --> 09:24.414
Then we got lost
in Louisiana.

09:24.968 --> 09:28.250
Oh hey, Sally,
do I love your apartment!

09:28.551 --> 09:31.004
It's so Zen, it's so empty.

09:31.301 --> 09:33.208
Are you into Zen?

09:36.884 --> 09:39.207
Lou, you're late again.
Peppy's very nervous.

09:39.509 --> 09:41.417
Peppy knows he's got
an appointment.

09:41.926 --> 09:44.166
I'm ringing this bell
like Charles Laughton...

09:44.509 --> 09:46.216
in <i>The Hunchback of Notre Dame.</i>

09:46.509 --> 09:47.540
You want that from me?

09:47.843 --> 09:50.627
To become a hunchback
ringing for you?

09:51.134 --> 09:52.331
You want hash and eggs?

09:52.634 --> 09:55.834
I am nobody's hunchback.
You work for me, Lou!

09:56.134 --> 09:58.705
The cigarettes you put
in your mouth, I pay for.

09:59.676 --> 10:02.046
I ring this bell
and you get down here.

10:02.551 --> 10:04.755
- You got no ketchup.
- Why the hell don't you get some?

10:05.051 --> 10:06.923
You want me starving to death?

10:10.801 --> 10:12.839
I think I got foot cancer.

10:23.843 --> 10:25.834
I can't find my mandala.

10:27.176 --> 10:30.091
Wait a minute!
What do you think you're doing?

10:30.676 --> 10:34.208
No. Stop. No.
You're not gonna start moving in here.

10:35.801 --> 10:38.124
Sally! Atlantic City's really bringing you down.

10:39.010 --> 10:41.130
Why don't you have a
Quaalude here. Relax!

10:41.426 --> 10:42.588
Here you go, Chrissie.

10:47.033 --> 10:49.742
- Don't come where I work!
- I came to see you!

10:49.783 --> 10:52.283
I don't want you following me
or any more of your surprises.

10:52.325 --> 10:54.367
What's going on in there?

10:54.450 --> 10:57.075
Dave, leave her alone.
Don't rough her up.

10:57.117 --> 10:59.617
If she doesn't want us,
we can go somewhere else.

10:59.700 --> 11:01.908
It's okay, Chrissie.

11:01.950 --> 11:04.117
Why don't you do
some deep breathing?

11:04.200 --> 11:05.908
Yeah, okay.

11:05.992 --> 11:08.575
He's really a wonderful man, Sally.

11:11.783 --> 11:13.950
Why did you do it?
Running away with her...

11:14.033 --> 11:17.158
humiliating me like that?

11:17.242 --> 11:21.908
If you're gonna knock 'em up, pick
somebody who can care of herself.

11:21.992 --> 11:24.908
What do you want me to say...
I'm sorry?

11:24.950 --> 11:27.117
These things happen.

11:28.908 --> 11:31.617
I want you out of here.

11:31.700 --> 11:33.117
I need you.

11:33.200 --> 11:35.992
I don't want you here.

11:36.075 --> 11:39.158
What about Chrissie?
She needs you.

11:39.242 --> 11:42.492
I'm not taking care
of either of you this time.

11:46.117 --> 11:48.158
Are you seeing someone?

11:48.242 --> 11:49.908
Yes, someone.

11:57.950 --> 12:01.617
You screwed me up in Vegas
so I couldn't get a job.

12:06.825 --> 12:08.783
This is what I've decided.

12:08.825 --> 12:11.783
After I die, I'm gonna
have Peppy buried in my arms.

12:11.825 --> 12:13.950
Do you think I trust you
to take care of him?

12:14.033 --> 12:17.242
You're not gonna get one nickel
to take care of him after I'm gone.

12:17.283 --> 12:20.075
Give me a kiss, Peppy.

12:20.158 --> 12:22.200
Little ass kisser!

12:22.283 --> 12:25.075
What are you saying?

12:26.783 --> 12:29.408
I said we need more dog food.

12:29.450 --> 12:32.075
- Did you cut the coupons?
- Yes, I cut the coupons.

12:32.158 --> 12:34.242
Shoo! Come on now, Peppy.

12:35.575 --> 12:39.033
There were 11 money-saver coupons
in the paper.

12:39.117 --> 12:41.742
There's 11 money-saving coupons
in there now.

12:41.825 --> 12:44.283
Here, you want to count them?

12:44.325 --> 12:46.992
I can't even move my hands anymore.

12:48.200 --> 12:52.075
- I'll rub your fingers for you.
- No, you stay away from me!

12:52.117 --> 12:55.450
Last time you shoved my arthritis
clear up to my elbow.

12:58.242 --> 13:00.617
Let me get going. It's late.

13:04.950 --> 13:08.617
- I'll need five more dollars.
- Five more? You want cigarettes?

13:08.700 --> 13:10.617
You steal cigarettes.

13:10.700 --> 13:12.617
You're the big-time thief...

13:12.700 --> 13:14.992
Mr. Mastermind...

13:15.075 --> 13:17.575
Mr. Ten-Most-Wanted.

13:17.658 --> 13:19.533
That's enough!

13:21.575 --> 13:22.992
Nothing's enough.

13:33.075 --> 13:34.492
Shit!

13:40.617 --> 13:44.408
I always wanted shoes with...

13:44.492 --> 13:49.200
clear plastic heels
you could see through with...

13:49.283 --> 13:52.283
live goldfish swimming in them.

13:53.908 --> 13:56.117
Wouldn't that be swift?

13:58.867 --> 14:01.283
Have to walk so delicate.

14:30.533 --> 14:33.783
You're like King Midas in reverse.
I don't want you touching my stuff.

14:33.867 --> 14:35.742
You owe me.

14:38.492 --> 14:40.325
Get out!

14:40.408 --> 14:43.075
Who got you out
of fucking Saskatchewan?

14:44.117 --> 14:47.492
If not for me, you'd be home making
jam, putting out for lumberjacks.

14:47.575 --> 14:49.117
Get out!

14:49.200 --> 14:51.492
You smell, you know that?

14:51.575 --> 14:53.950
Like a can of rotten tuna fish.

15:30.325 --> 15:33.075
I don't think you smell
of tuna fish.

15:35.617 --> 15:38.658
Are you mad at me
for going off with Dave?

15:46.950 --> 15:51.450
I think of this baby as being ours.
Dave and mine and yours.

15:53.242 --> 15:57.075
Dave's got a much higher developed
soul than either you or me.

15:57.117 --> 15:59.658
I've hardly been reincarnated
at all, but Dave...

15:59.742 --> 16:02.325
he can remember all the way back
to ancient Egypt...

16:02.408 --> 16:04.867
building the pyramids
and all of that.

16:04.950 --> 16:07.408
He's had some really hard lives.

16:07.492 --> 16:10.867
I think he's due for
a real big break in this one.

16:15.700 --> 16:18.658
You can stay here tonight.

16:18.742 --> 16:20.158
Thanks.

16:24.450 --> 16:27.158
I am not gonna get upset!

17:17.242 --> 17:18.492
Hi, Peppy.

17:18.575 --> 17:21.492
- Grace says the usual.
- I know what to give Peppy.

17:21.575 --> 17:23.075
Come on, baby.

17:24.700 --> 17:27.575
- A dollar on 123.
- Right.

17:27.617 --> 17:32.242
Going out of business, Lou. No sense
playing the numbers anymore.

17:32.325 --> 17:34.450
Ida Cohen, with the six parakeets...

17:34.533 --> 17:38.117
won $400 on eight quarters
at the casino.

17:38.200 --> 17:39.783
Got anything for me?

17:51.908 --> 17:55.075
- What have you got for me today?
- Got this 421.

17:55.158 --> 17:56.783
4-2-1.

17:56.867 --> 17:58.575
Six bits.

18:09.783 --> 18:12.617
Lou! 496.

18:15.450 --> 18:18.408
Fifty cents.
Make me a winner, man!

18:21.700 --> 18:23.117
Sadie.

18:25.200 --> 18:27.783
- 3-2-1.
- Wish me luck today, Lou.

18:27.867 --> 18:30.158
I will.
Good number, 321.

18:43.617 --> 18:45.575
Place your bets.

18:47.908 --> 18:49.992
No more bets.

19:00.492 --> 19:03.450
- You looked!
- You spilled your drink!

19:03.492 --> 19:08.075
No, you took your eyes up.
You allowed me to distract you!

19:09.408 --> 19:11.408
Everyone, listen to me.

19:13.992 --> 19:16.867
The players are coming
to the casino in teams.

19:16.950 --> 19:18.867
One sits here,
one sits there.

19:18.950 --> 19:20.867
The cards are good.

19:20.950 --> 19:23.242
The player at the first base
spills his drink.

19:23.283 --> 19:24.783
Your eye moves.

19:24.825 --> 19:28.033
The player at the third base
triples his bets.

19:29.033 --> 19:32.450
They have a million clever ways
of trying to cheat you.

19:34.825 --> 19:36.200
Focus!

19:37.283 --> 19:40.242
Concentrate! Concentrate.

19:43.992 --> 19:45.450
Go ahead.

19:58.450 --> 20:00.908
Darling, you were late.

20:00.992 --> 20:02.450
Family.

20:03.450 --> 20:05.575
Did you like the music?

20:05.658 --> 20:08.908
Marvelous music...
"Norma Casta Diva."

20:08.950 --> 20:11.950
The chaste goddess
worshipping the moon.

20:13.117 --> 20:15.200
Yeah, I'm beginning to like it.

20:15.283 --> 20:18.408
Dignity, passion, size.

20:19.617 --> 20:22.992
Can I lay a hard ten
on a soft three?

20:40.867 --> 20:42.283
Yep.

20:43.950 --> 20:45.950
Yeah, okay. Bye.

20:46.950 --> 20:50.075
- Forty-eight dollars and six bits.
- You're down this week.

20:50.117 --> 20:52.450
Everybody's broke.
I got any winners?

20:52.533 --> 20:56.075
Better not have.
I can't afford fucking winners.

21:00.450 --> 21:04.575
Freddy, how 'bout a double sawbuck
for the case? It's a real beauty.

21:05.658 --> 21:09.117
How am I supposed to fit my Cuban
Monte Cristos in this piece of shit?

21:09.158 --> 21:12.033
Where are you coming from?

21:17.742 --> 21:21.617
- Do you know a Fred O'Reilly?
- Fred's right over there.

21:21.700 --> 21:23.908
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

21:27.117 --> 21:30.992
Hi, you Fred O'Reilly?

21:31.075 --> 21:32.492
Yeah. Who are you?

21:32.575 --> 21:37.408
Something new, huh?
Let me see. Very nice.

21:37.450 --> 21:40.825
- I won $300 at the casino.
- Casino.

21:40.908 --> 21:42.450
Hey, Queenie.

22:02.950 --> 22:05.617
Hey, man, I need a little space
around here.

22:05.700 --> 22:07.908
Come on!
I got business!

22:13.575 --> 22:15.575
Let's take a look.

22:22.075 --> 22:23.908
There you go.

22:36.367 --> 22:37.992
Very nice.

22:45.117 --> 22:47.617
Very nice indeed.

22:47.700 --> 22:50.075
There's been a slight dry spell
around here.

22:50.158 --> 22:53.242
Dry spell's over.
White Christmas, perfect timing.

22:53.325 --> 22:56.325
A friend called this a.m.
Could I help him?

22:56.408 --> 22:58.617
Had to say no.

22:58.700 --> 23:01.450
- Where'd you get this?
- I found it in a phone booth.

23:01.533 --> 23:04.992
- In Philadelphia?
- How did you know?

23:07.200 --> 23:09.242
I'll help your friend.

23:09.325 --> 23:12.075
Not looking like that, you won't.

23:14.325 --> 23:19.033
This is a family town.
Better get yourself cleaned up.

23:19.117 --> 23:22.200
A nice leisure suit, powder blue.

23:23.117 --> 23:27.033
- You don't need a tie.
- Maybe you could advance me.

23:27.117 --> 23:31.325
You know, $200? $300?
You know I'm good for it.

23:31.408 --> 23:34.742
This is a very tight town.

23:34.783 --> 23:38.533
I only do business with the people
I do business with.

23:38.617 --> 23:40.908
The people I do business with
find out I do business...

23:40.992 --> 23:43.950
with the people
I don't do business with...

23:45.492 --> 23:47.450
I can't do business with you.

23:47.492 --> 23:49.825
But Boomer in Vegas said...

23:49.908 --> 23:53.075
I don't do business
with Boomer in Vegas.

23:54.492 --> 23:56.450
You look like a fire sale.

23:56.492 --> 23:58.742
Look...

23:58.825 --> 24:01.492
I've been on the road six weeks.

24:01.575 --> 24:03.867
You clean me up,
I'm a fuckin' Prince Charles.

24:05.783 --> 24:09.408
You won't help me?
Look, I'm cutting you in!

24:18.617 --> 24:21.908
I sure would like
to help my friend.

24:23.575 --> 24:28.492
But remember,
I don't do business with you.

24:36.992 --> 24:38.450
Shit!

24:44.367 --> 24:46.242
You got a phone?

24:46.283 --> 24:48.117
Telephone is upstairs.

24:48.200 --> 24:52.908
Wait a minute. Let him use
the bar phone. I know the kid.

24:57.325 --> 24:59.575
Find the place
you were looking for?

25:05.700 --> 25:07.742
We live in the same building.

25:08.783 --> 25:11.575
That's why I'm talking to you,
because we live in the same...

25:11.658 --> 25:14.992
Yeah, Fred gave me your number.

25:17.200 --> 25:20.075
Hey, Bob! Beer.

25:20.117 --> 25:22.117
Cold one this time.

25:22.200 --> 25:24.117
Okay, I'll be there.

25:32.742 --> 25:36.367
- Your friend wants to do business.
- They'll bust you in the lobby.

25:36.450 --> 25:40.283
You look like a training poster
from the narc squad.

25:40.367 --> 25:41.783
Powder blue leisure suit.

25:41.867 --> 25:45.200
Hey, Lou. I want you to run
an errand for me.

25:45.283 --> 25:47.242
I'm booked up.

25:48.200 --> 25:50.117
Who's the old guy?

25:50.158 --> 25:54.742
You mean Lou? He used to run numbers
for the dinosaurs.

26:04.450 --> 26:06.367
Hey, why did you leave?

26:06.450 --> 26:09.950
Back there we started talking.
I had other things on my mind.

26:10.033 --> 26:12.783
I was just trying to be friendly
so piss off!

26:15.450 --> 26:19.367
Listen, I hear you're very big
in circles around here.

26:19.450 --> 26:20.950
Where'd you hear that?

26:20.992 --> 26:23.575
Vegas. Las Vegas.

26:26.992 --> 26:28.950
You heard about me in Vegas?

26:28.992 --> 26:32.242
Oh, yeah! The man to know!

26:33.408 --> 26:35.575
Let me understand something, kid.

26:35.658 --> 26:38.992
You're talking about
Las Vegas, Nevada?

26:39.075 --> 26:40.783
Right, yeah.

26:40.867 --> 26:43.242
That I was the man to know?

26:43.325 --> 26:45.075
Lou, right?

26:45.825 --> 26:47.783
Class dismissed.

26:59.783 --> 27:01.242
Come on, Peppy.

27:02.492 --> 27:04.742
Come on, you little mutt.

27:06.450 --> 27:10.325
This ain't my dog.
Belongs to the lady downstairs.

27:10.408 --> 27:14.075
I'm more of a German shepherd type
of guy. Isn't that right, Peppy?

27:14.117 --> 27:16.158
Doin' the old lady a favor.

27:19.492 --> 27:21.575
There's the building.

27:21.658 --> 27:24.742
A shame you never saw it
in the old days, a real work of art.

27:24.825 --> 27:27.783
They're gonna tear it down now
and build a casino.

27:29.950 --> 27:34.117
Lou, could I borrow your apartment?

27:34.200 --> 27:35.617
My apartment?

27:35.700 --> 27:38.950
Yeah, just for an hour. There's
a hundred bucks in it for you.

27:39.033 --> 27:41.283
- A hundred bucks?
- Yeah.

27:41.367 --> 27:43.283
Let me tell you something, kiddo.

27:43.367 --> 27:46.158
My room ain't exactly
the royal suite of Mr. Casanova.

27:46.242 --> 27:48.575
No, no, it's not for a girl.

27:48.617 --> 27:50.825
It's technical, business.

27:52.533 --> 27:55.075
Who was it told you about me
in Vegas?

27:55.158 --> 27:59.575
Well, you know, it was in a crowd
of people, your name popped up.

27:59.617 --> 28:01.367
Tall fella?

28:01.450 --> 28:03.742
Yeah, yeah, that's the one.

28:05.450 --> 28:07.450
Harry Gropke.

28:07.533 --> 28:11.283
Harry went to Vegas, I think.
It must have been Harry.

28:11.367 --> 28:14.117
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, Harry.

28:14.200 --> 28:17.575
You know something?
I've known Harry for 30 years.

28:17.617 --> 28:20.700
- I haven't seen him in 25.
- Yeah?

28:20.825 --> 28:25.450
<i>I adore attractive,
well-groomed educated women:</i>

28:26.783 --> 28:29.408
<i>You mean, making the church scene?</i>

28:29.492 --> 28:32.408
<i>Forget it, Reverend:
I'm not resting!</i>

28:40.575 --> 28:41.992
Here we are.

28:42.075 --> 28:44.325
No strangers in here!

28:44.408 --> 28:47.950
Dave's staying upstairs. He's from
Las Vegas. Friend of Harry Gropke's.

28:48.033 --> 28:51.408
- I've got business to discuss.
- Not now, Grace. Later.

28:51.450 --> 28:55.158
Where's Cookie's silver cigarette
case? It was here by my bed.

28:55.242 --> 28:58.533
- I see you got a scale.
- Weight Watchers. Measures food.

28:58.617 --> 29:00.200
Get it for me.

29:00.283 --> 29:05.075
Lou, you get back here. You've got
to push the blood back in my feet.

29:05.158 --> 29:07.117
I'll be right back.

29:08.408 --> 29:10.450
Lou, come back!

29:18.408 --> 29:20.200
Come in, come in.

29:34.242 --> 29:36.450
Would you close the blinds?

29:46.450 --> 29:49.075
I need a tablespoon.

29:52.658 --> 29:54.742
That's great. Thanks.

30:00.950 --> 30:02.992
Italian baby laxative.

30:04.325 --> 30:06.325
That's what it is.

30:18.117 --> 30:20.367
You like magic?

30:23.242 --> 30:26.325
Pass your hand over the scale.

30:26.408 --> 30:28.075
What?

30:28.158 --> 30:30.492
Come on! Go on! Do it.

30:32.283 --> 30:33.700
That's $2,000.

30:35.117 --> 30:36.908
Two thousand dollars?

30:40.325 --> 30:42.658
Okay, say abracadabra.

30:42.742 --> 30:45.658
- Come on.
- Come on, say it!

30:46.742 --> 30:48.367
Abracadabra.

30:54.867 --> 30:56.617
That's $4,000.

31:15.117 --> 31:17.742
Could you stash this
for me somewhere?

31:17.825 --> 31:20.450
- Jeez, I don't know.
- It's only for a couple hours.

31:25.700 --> 31:28.742
Look, you know the streets here.
Could you walk me?

31:28.825 --> 31:31.033
I can't leave Grace.

31:31.117 --> 31:33.450
Are you afraid?

31:33.533 --> 31:35.533
I've got a medical problem with her.

31:35.617 --> 31:37.867
- Are you a doctor?
- Doctor?

31:37.950 --> 31:42.367
There's something wrong with
the feet. The blood don't flow good.

31:42.450 --> 31:45.117
Why don't you tell me?
Come on.

31:45.200 --> 31:49.367
- Wait a minute.
- Chrissie, I got a job for ya!

31:52.575 --> 31:55.033
Got your fingers warmed up?

31:55.117 --> 31:59.075
This is not Grand Central Station.
What's wrong with you today?

31:59.117 --> 32:02.742
These people are going to help you.
Come on, Peppy, you're in the way.

32:02.825 --> 32:04.450
You're fired, Lou.

32:04.533 --> 32:06.992
Dave, this lady's got a
million things wrong with her.

32:07.075 --> 32:09.242
Get her out of here.

32:09.283 --> 32:14.117
This lady is almost a qualified
therapist in Nevada and Oklahoma.

32:14.200 --> 32:18.325
She trained in Saskatchewan, Canada,
in the art of Korean foot massage.

32:18.408 --> 32:21.658
If you leave me alone with her,
I'm gonna kill you, Lou.

32:21.742 --> 32:25.992
Will you listen for just once?
This is not medicine.

32:26.075 --> 32:29.783
I'm still a very important woman
in this town.

32:29.867 --> 32:32.825
I'm Cookie Pinza's widow.

32:33.867 --> 32:37.617
He used to deliver coffee
for Cookie.

32:40.658 --> 32:42.617
He's my servant.

32:42.658 --> 32:46.742
Do you know that your whole body
ends at the bottom of your feet?

32:46.825 --> 32:49.783
You think I am just poking
your feet.

32:49.825 --> 32:54.825
Well, when I touch this spot,
this is where your spine is.

32:54.908 --> 32:59.158
When I touch this spot,
this is where your tummy is.

32:59.283 --> 33:02.117
You work for that Grace?

33:02.200 --> 33:03.783
I help her out.

33:03.867 --> 33:05.992
She pays you?

33:06.075 --> 33:10.908
You're her fancy man?
Are you servicing her?

33:10.950 --> 33:12.700
Every now and then.

33:12.783 --> 33:15.908
Wow. To be your age
and still working at it.

33:15.950 --> 33:18.950
Mr. Stud! Mr. John!

33:19.033 --> 33:22.700
Well, I keep myself in trim.

33:22.783 --> 33:25.867
Monte Carlo!

33:25.950 --> 33:30.242
The old casino is very, very slow
and old-fashioned.

33:30.325 --> 33:33.242
Rococo elegance. But the new casino
is just like Vegas.

33:33.283 --> 33:34.492
Really?

33:34.575 --> 33:39.242
The croupiers are French, but the
dealers are American from Vegas.

33:41.158 --> 33:45.742
You get your license to learn how to
deal and the world opens up to you.

33:48.742 --> 33:53.408
It's not just cards, you know.
It's your future.

33:54.742 --> 33:57.575
I want you to concentrate.

33:57.658 --> 34:00.783
I hate you going back
to that oyster bar.

34:00.867 --> 34:03.117
The world should be your oyster.

34:04.450 --> 34:08.117
Well, I've got so much to learn.
I don't know how to count in French.

34:08.199 --> 34:09.283
I know...

34:14.324 --> 34:16.699
Do you think you could teach me?

34:16.783 --> 34:18.783
Better than that.

34:24.033 --> 34:26.658
If you'd only stop being afraid.

34:26.742 --> 34:29.324
Deal with courage.

34:29.408 --> 34:32.574
You're a little pearl
produced by that oyster bar.

34:34.699 --> 34:36.617
Say that in French.

34:58.117 --> 35:00.825
The name Capone
mean anything to you?

35:00.908 --> 35:03.367
Al Capone? The Godfather?

35:03.450 --> 35:06.325
Lucky Luciano, Dutch Schultz,
Meyer Lansky.

35:06.408 --> 35:08.325
Do you know them?

35:08.408 --> 35:11.075
You work for the people
who work for the people.

35:11.117 --> 35:13.658
I was taken a shine to.

35:13.742 --> 35:17.367
Pardon me, but you don't exactly
look like the "King of the Mobs."

35:18.450 --> 35:23.200
Well, a few wrong turns,
wrong affections, some mistakes.

35:24.867 --> 35:27.075
It's all shit now.

35:27.158 --> 35:30.575
It's a shame you never saw
Atlantic City when it had floy floy.

35:30.617 --> 35:33.742
Remember the song, "Flatfoot Floogie
with the Floy Floy"?

35:33.825 --> 35:36.908
Hep cat and zoot suit.
That was the floogie part.

35:36.992 --> 35:38.992
The floy floy.

35:39.075 --> 35:41.283
That was something special.

35:41.367 --> 35:44.742
Atlantic City had floy floy coming
out of its ears in those days.

35:46.117 --> 35:48.408
Now it's all so goddamn legal.

35:48.492 --> 35:50.867
Howard Johnson running a casino.

35:50.950 --> 35:54.117
Tutti-frutti ice cream
and craps don't mix.

35:54.200 --> 35:58.533
The only difference between
Christianity and Hare Krishna is...

35:58.617 --> 36:00.533
Hare Krishna is real.

36:00.617 --> 36:04.283
If Jesus was alive today,
he'd be very much into Hare Krishna.

36:04.367 --> 36:06.158
- Chrissie!
- Yeah?

36:06.242 --> 36:08.450
Do my sinuses again.

36:12.575 --> 36:14.492
- What language is that?
- French.

36:16.575 --> 36:18.242
Is it hard, French?

36:18.283 --> 36:21.075
It's the language of
international diplomacy.

36:27.283 --> 36:29.783
It's nice, French.

36:29.825 --> 36:31.783
Your husband's a real cutie!

36:31.867 --> 36:33.783
He's leaving tomorrow.

36:42.950 --> 36:45.158
Have you seen my wallet?

36:51.492 --> 36:53.492
I can't find my wallet.

36:55.200 --> 36:57.158
We go this way.

36:58.742 --> 37:01.200
Yes, it used to be beautiful...

37:01.283 --> 37:06.033
what with the rackets,
the whoring, guns.

37:06.117 --> 37:08.075
Sometimes...

37:08.158 --> 37:11.408
Sometimes things would happen,
I'd have to kill a few people.

37:11.450 --> 37:15.575
I'd feel bad for a while, but I'd
jump into the ocean, swim way out.

37:15.617 --> 37:19.200
Come back in feeling nice and clean,
start all over again.

37:20.867 --> 37:23.200
I never seen the Atlantic Ocean
till just now.

37:23.283 --> 37:25.742
The Atlantic Ocean
was something then.

37:27.200 --> 37:30.492
Yeah, you should've seen
the Atlantic Ocean in those days.

37:32.450 --> 37:34.075
Come on.

37:38.825 --> 37:40.575
There's your hotel.

37:40.658 --> 37:43.908
I could like it here.
You can breathe.

37:45.450 --> 37:48.200
They used to call Atlantic City
the lungs of Philadelphia.

37:51.033 --> 37:54.533
We stay long enough, we could be
the nose of Philadelphia.

38:00.533 --> 38:02.700
- What room?
- 307.

38:06.242 --> 38:08.825
Look, you go up alone.

38:08.908 --> 38:10.658
What do you mean?

38:10.742 --> 38:13.158
Just hand him this.
I'll wait outside.

38:13.242 --> 38:14.992
Ain't you comin' with me?

38:15.075 --> 38:18.700
I can't. Not the way I'm dressed.
I mean, you look sharp.

38:18.783 --> 38:20.700
You ain't trying to set me up.

38:20.783 --> 38:24.283
I'm trusting you.
I left a fortune in your apartment.

38:24.367 --> 38:28.283
Look, you just give him
the package.

38:28.367 --> 38:32.200
You wait for an envelope with the
money. There's another 100 for ya.

38:32.283 --> 38:34.783
Can't you do it?

38:42.617 --> 38:44.783
You better get yourself
some new clothes.

38:44.867 --> 38:47.242
Tomorrow. Floy floy.

38:48.158 --> 38:50.408
- 307?
- Right.

38:50.450 --> 38:52.533
I'll be up on the boardwalk.

39:20.450 --> 39:22.075
I got a...

39:30.783 --> 39:32.950
I've got a package from Dave.

39:36.075 --> 39:38.908
What, is medicare dealing now?
Come on in.

39:48.950 --> 39:50.908
Everybody in?

39:52.242 --> 39:53.825
Pair of fives.

40:02.533 --> 40:05.825
Fella here wants to talk to you.

40:30.575 --> 40:32.908
Hey, man, what's going on?

40:47.117 --> 40:50.533
We'd like you to keep it going
if you don't mind.

41:59.783 --> 42:03.575
There's a lot of other people
we gotta see first.

42:03.617 --> 42:06.367
The whole East Coast
is like the Sahara Desert.

42:06.450 --> 42:08.742
Every source is dried up.
You old "kocker" you.

42:08.825 --> 42:11.200
Tell me.
Where'd you get this stuff?

42:11.283 --> 42:12.742
Medicare.

42:14.325 --> 42:16.992
All right. I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to offend you.

42:17.075 --> 42:20.658
I'm trying to hold a game together.
I'm calling everywhere.

42:20.742 --> 42:22.408
Four G's.

42:23.700 --> 42:25.617
I know. Four G's.

42:27.783 --> 42:29.908
Tomorrow, huh?

43:00.867 --> 43:02.283
Lou Paschall?

43:07.450 --> 43:09.825
Buddy. Buddy O'Brien!

43:09.908 --> 43:13.075
That's me!
You're lookin' great, Lou.

43:13.117 --> 43:14.742
How you doin'?

43:14.783 --> 43:17.242
Fine. I'm doin' perfect.

43:18.867 --> 43:22.533
It's good to see you, Buddy.
Oh, here. There we are.

43:22.617 --> 43:25.200
Hey, hey, not from you, I don't.

43:25.283 --> 43:28.908
Go on, take it.
It's a good time for me.

43:30.783 --> 43:32.825
Get in the chair.
I'll give you a shine.

43:46.992 --> 43:48.908
- It's a long time.
- Yeah.

43:51.617 --> 43:53.783
Remember the day
Nucky Johnson sent us...

43:53.867 --> 43:56.658
to buy 100 boxes of rubbers
for the party?

43:58.617 --> 44:00.533
The look the guy gave us!

44:00.617 --> 44:03.492
A hundred boxes of rubbers
for two guys.

44:03.575 --> 44:05.575
He couldn't get over it.

44:07.492 --> 44:09.658
Buddy, you live too much
in the past.

44:09.742 --> 44:13.117
Yeah. But them were the days.

44:56.408 --> 44:58.325
Mrs. Matthews?

44:58.408 --> 44:59.825
Yes.

45:01.075 --> 45:03.658
Great! Where did you find it?

45:08.742 --> 45:10.950
<i>I have a vision of the future:</i>

45:11.033 --> 45:13.908
This glorious island
of Atlantic City...

45:13.992 --> 45:17.867
shining like a beacon whose light
was nearly extinguished.

45:17.950 --> 45:21.950
If it wasn't for the casinos,
we'd have been dead a long time ago.

45:22.033 --> 45:25.617
And so I accept with great pleasure
this check from all the casinos.

45:25.700 --> 45:29.867
- Thank you, Mr. Goulet.
- You're welcome, Doctor.

45:29.950 --> 45:32.158
I want to thank the people
whose money I had for a while.

45:32.242 --> 45:34.867
Last night I was lucky at the tables
but on the way home...

45:34.950 --> 45:39.700
on the boardwalk,
I was mugged by my own croupier!

45:58.700 --> 46:02.575
<i>Just flew into town tonight</i>

46:02.617 --> 46:06.033
<i>Lady Luck was on our flight</i>

46:06.117 --> 46:08.033
<i>Had a bite to eat</i>

46:08.117 --> 46:10.325
<i>At Geno's down the street</i>

46:10.408 --> 46:14.200
<i>And now this welcome sight</i>

46:14.283 --> 46:17.825
<i>Glad to see you're born again</i>

46:17.908 --> 46:21.575
<i>Atlantic City, my old friend</i>

46:21.658 --> 46:23.617
<i>Be there when I bet on ten</i>

46:24.950 --> 46:27.783
You're not planning
on leaving town, are you?

46:27.867 --> 46:31.242
I want to make it here. I really
like this town. I wanna be a dealer.

46:31.283 --> 46:33.825
I think Atlantic City's
the greatest.

46:33.908 --> 46:36.075
- Mrs. Matthews, you...
- What?

46:36.117 --> 46:38.075
You can claim the body tomorrow.

46:38.117 --> 46:40.867
I don't want the body!

46:41.950 --> 46:45.700
<i>And now you're here to stay</i>

46:45.783 --> 46:49.283
<i>Remember how they put you down</i>

46:49.367 --> 46:53.450
<i>There's not an empty room in town</i>

46:53.533 --> 46:56.492
<i>They're coming here
from miles around</i>

46:56.575 --> 46:58.867
<i>You sure came through</i>

47:01.908 --> 47:05.867
<i>I'm glad to see you're born again</i>

47:05.950 --> 47:08.158
Saskatchewan. Area code 306...

47:12.908 --> 47:17.700
<i>- To Mr. Or Mrs. Peter Matthews.
- You're back upon the map again</i>

47:17.783 --> 47:19.533
Sally Matthews.

47:19.617 --> 47:22.658
<i>You sure came through</i>

47:22.742 --> 47:25.700
What do you mean they won't accept
the charges? It's about their son.

47:25.783 --> 47:28.533
Hello? Dave's dead. Hello!

47:36.617 --> 47:39.075
- I heard about Dave. I'm sorry.
- Who are...

47:39.117 --> 47:41.533
We live in the same building.
Next door.

47:43.575 --> 47:45.992
Come on, I'll walk you home.

47:48.075 --> 47:51.950
I don't know what to do about his
body. I tried calling his parents.

47:52.033 --> 47:53.950
They wouldn't even accept
the charges.

47:54.033 --> 47:57.742
- They've got to know.
- I don't have any money.

47:59.742 --> 48:01.867
Don't worry about it.
Come on.

48:17.158 --> 48:18.867
I can't. I, I...

48:21.533 --> 48:24.533
Hello? Mr. Matthews?

48:24.617 --> 48:27.908
I was a friend of your son Dave.

48:27.950 --> 48:31.367
My name... My name is Lou.

48:31.450 --> 48:36.117
I'm sorry to have to tell you.
There's been a very bad accident.

48:40.658 --> 48:42.700
Can I take your order?

48:42.783 --> 48:45.158
Just some water, please.

48:56.283 --> 48:59.575
The news didn't exactly break their
hearts, but at least they know.

49:02.908 --> 49:06.742
I've been thinking about
the burial and disposal.

49:07.783 --> 49:10.367
You're gonna need help.

49:10.450 --> 49:13.325
I hate to bring this up, but...

49:13.408 --> 49:15.658
when something like this happens...

49:15.742 --> 49:17.742
there's certain things
you've got to do.

49:17.825 --> 49:19.742
And you're new in this town.

49:21.075 --> 49:22.575
Christ!

49:29.325 --> 49:32.033
Remember, I'm Lou Paschall
if there's anything you need.

49:32.117 --> 49:34.825
I know your name from the mailbox.
I got a piece of your mail once.

49:34.908 --> 49:37.950
- I slipped it under your door.
- Oh, was that you?

49:38.033 --> 49:41.408
It was just junk mail,
but I appreciate what you did.

49:41.492 --> 49:44.325
Coupons for paper towels.
You saved me money.

49:46.450 --> 49:49.533
- I'm Sally Matthews.
- I know.

49:49.617 --> 49:52.325
Thanks very much
for everything, really.

49:52.408 --> 49:54.075
It's okay.

49:59.492 --> 50:01.992
God, I don't know
what to say to my sister.

50:04.117 --> 50:08.783
Look, your sister is downstairs
baby-sitting Grace... Mrs. Pinza.

50:08.867 --> 50:11.742
Why don't you go to bed, get
some rest, tell her in the morning?

50:11.825 --> 50:13.867
Young girls are strong.

50:13.950 --> 50:15.742
Yeah.

50:15.825 --> 50:18.075
Good night.

50:18.158 --> 50:19.658
Good night.

51:01.492 --> 51:02.908
Jesus.

53:07.783 --> 53:10.200
You can go upstairs now.

53:13.658 --> 53:15.575
All right, all right.

53:18.408 --> 53:19.992
Your sister is back.

54:16.950 --> 54:19.242
What's got into you?

56:00.533 --> 56:01.950
Shit!

56:03.450 --> 56:06.242
- Where are my oysters?
- Relax.

56:06.325 --> 56:09.367
Well, at least you got
your wallet back.

56:09.450 --> 56:13.950
Last night I dreamt I came here
and Dave's body was on the ice.

56:16.325 --> 56:18.492
- Sign this.
- What is it?

56:18.575 --> 56:21.617
It's for your husband.
Sign here and here.

56:21.700 --> 56:24.408
- But what...
- Believe me, it's all right.

56:24.492 --> 56:28.450
And put down the address,
the family address in Canada.

56:30.617 --> 56:33.492
- What did you do to your hand?
- Nothing.

56:34.867 --> 56:37.867
- What time do you get off?
- 12:00.

56:40.533 --> 56:43.242
Terrific. I'll see you.

57:12.325 --> 57:14.283
Holy shit!

57:14.367 --> 57:17.408
Santa Claus is looking real hot.
Come on in.

57:17.492 --> 57:21.700
Everybody, hold it. Let's have
a little applause for Santa Claus.

57:23.408 --> 57:24.825
Gentlemen.

57:25.742 --> 57:29.200
Go ahead.
Compliments of the house.

57:30.283 --> 57:34.200
Hey, Pops, what planet
do you come from?

57:34.283 --> 57:38.950
I want to do something for ya.
Here, take my watch. Go ahead.

57:40.450 --> 57:43.575
You don't want it? Take my wife!
Take my life! Take anything!

57:43.658 --> 57:46.533
Just cut out the bullshit,
let me have the money.

57:51.325 --> 57:53.242
You're all right, Pops.

58:02.700 --> 58:05.033
Not bad. Not bad.

58:07.450 --> 58:11.158
Couple of inches off the sleeves,
a little off the skirt...

58:11.242 --> 58:13.200
and you'll look just fine.

58:14.283 --> 58:15.742
For the tailor.

58:15.783 --> 58:19.783
Double sawbuck?
Hey, thanks a lot!

58:19.867 --> 58:22.908
Listen, when things start going good
for me, I'll make it up to you.

58:29.492 --> 58:32.033
A dozen oysters, please.

58:32.117 --> 58:34.742
- Hi.
- I took care of Dave.

58:34.783 --> 58:38.158
The forms you signed, they were
releases to send the body to Canada.

58:38.242 --> 58:42.867
You were busy, and the arrangements,
mail, the plane, it's a lot of work.

58:42.950 --> 58:45.825
You paid to have his body
flown to Canada?

58:45.908 --> 58:47.658
I hope you don't mind.

58:47.742 --> 58:52.408
- The money! Must've been expensive.
- Forget the money. I'm a neighbor.

58:53.950 --> 58:55.867
Why are you doing all this?

58:55.950 --> 58:58.992
It's nothing!
Sinatra gives wings to hospitals.

58:59.075 --> 59:01.450
We all do what we can.

59:01.533 --> 59:04.075
- It's 12:00.
- Yeah?

59:04.158 --> 59:06.158
I'll wait for you.

59:10.783 --> 59:12.908
There's four extra in there.

59:12.992 --> 59:16.200
They're really strict here. They
count the shells. I'm not kidding.

59:16.242 --> 59:19.367
I don't really want these, honey.
We're going to lunch.

59:19.450 --> 59:21.367
Hey, thanks!

59:31.033 --> 59:32.658
New casino.

59:32.742 --> 59:36.992
Burger King casinos. McDonald's
casinos. Pizzeria casinos. Jesus!

59:37.075 --> 59:39.742
Where I work they rake in
over a million bucks a day.

59:39.783 --> 59:41.783
- Really?
- Yeah.

59:45.408 --> 59:48.242
You like the casinos?
You go to them?

59:48.283 --> 59:50.908
No. No, I don't like them.

59:50.992 --> 59:54.033
They're too wholesome for me.

59:54.075 --> 59:58.242
I mean nuns, for Christ sake,
standing in line. Boy Scout troops.

59:58.283 --> 01:00:01.617
People blowing their...
their welfare checks.

01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:04.408
It's too much nickel-and-diming.

01:00:04.492 --> 01:00:08.117
All that money you carry around,
that's no nickel-and-diming.

01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:10.242
It quiets the nerves.

01:00:11.575 --> 01:00:15.992
Why do you live in the same dump
I do when you could afford a palace?

01:00:16.075 --> 01:00:17.492
Well, I...

01:00:19.617 --> 01:00:21.700
To tell you the truth,
I stay there for Grace.

01:00:21.783 --> 01:00:26.408
When they tear it down, I'll take
Grace someplace and head to Miami.

01:00:26.492 --> 01:00:27.908
You like Miami?

01:00:27.992 --> 01:00:30.575
I'm thinking of going to Monaco.

01:00:30.658 --> 01:00:32.242
Oh, Monaco!

01:00:32.325 --> 01:00:35.075
That's the place with that Kelly
girl from Philadelphia. She's queen.

01:00:35.158 --> 01:00:39.325
Yeah, they have a casino there,
very elegant.

01:00:39.408 --> 01:00:41.742
No women dealers yet,
but I'm hoping.

01:00:41.825 --> 01:00:46.242
Only now I'm learning about music
and I'm gonna start reading books.

01:00:46.283 --> 01:00:50.908
Developing some style. Learning new
languages because I want to travel.

01:00:50.992 --> 01:00:53.908
You thinking of leaving
Atlantic City?

01:00:53.992 --> 01:00:56.408
Not for a couple of years.
I've got to develop my blackjack.

01:00:56.492 --> 01:00:59.783
I'm gonna deal my way to Europe,
to Monte Carlo.

01:01:00.908 --> 01:01:02.992
A regular Princess Grace!

01:01:13.450 --> 01:01:15.867
- Catch of the day?
- No fish!

01:01:15.950 --> 01:01:19.575
No clams, no mussels, no oysters,
no shrimp! I want meat!

01:01:19.617 --> 01:01:21.575
Lamb chops and pork chops
and liver.

01:01:21.617 --> 01:01:24.742
Bring us a menu.
And, waiter...

01:01:24.825 --> 01:01:26.408
more wine... the same.

01:01:27.992 --> 01:01:31.033
I don't want anything that swims.

01:01:31.075 --> 01:01:34.200
- Cigarette?
- Yeah. Oh, no. They're too strong.

01:01:34.283 --> 01:01:36.283
- Can I see that?
- Sure.

01:01:39.867 --> 01:01:42.367
It's nice to have money
to have things.

01:01:43.783 --> 01:01:48.575
This belonged to Grace's husband,
Cookie Pinza, a personal friend.

01:01:48.658 --> 01:01:51.408
Puligny-Montrachet 1966.

01:01:52.700 --> 01:01:54.575
Smell.

01:01:54.617 --> 01:01:57.408
Okay?

01:01:57.450 --> 01:01:59.033
I'll do it.

01:02:03.908 --> 01:02:05.742
Teach me stuff.

01:02:06.992 --> 01:02:09.408
Like what?

01:02:09.450 --> 01:02:11.408
What you know.

01:02:11.450 --> 01:02:14.033
- You want information or wisdom?
- Both.

01:02:16.408 --> 01:02:18.200
I'll think about it.

01:02:18.242 --> 01:02:22.617
The smartest man in the world was
on a quiz show winning everything.

01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:25.075
You know how they finally
tripped him up?

01:02:25.117 --> 01:02:29.325
He knew everything under the sun
except his Social Security number.

01:02:29.408 --> 01:02:31.367
He could have had the world.

01:02:31.408 --> 01:02:32.950
What's yours?

01:02:34.033 --> 01:02:36.992
I don't have
a Social Security number.

01:02:37.075 --> 01:02:39.408
Everybody's got
a Social Security number.

01:02:39.450 --> 01:02:41.533
You pay income tax?

01:02:43.575 --> 01:02:45.617
You still got your fingerprints?

01:02:45.700 --> 01:02:50.325
- Well, sure.
- Let me see. Oh, my God!

01:02:50.408 --> 01:02:52.575
- You don't have any fingerprints!
- What are you talking about?

01:02:52.658 --> 01:02:55.242
I got fingerprints.
I got lines...

01:03:04.283 --> 01:03:06.450
You wanna go back to Saskatchewan?

01:03:06.533 --> 01:03:08.325
I mean for the funeral.

01:03:08.408 --> 01:03:11.367
Look, I haven't been back there
for ten years.

01:03:11.408 --> 01:03:15.075
I'll stake you to a round-trip.
You can come right back.

01:03:15.117 --> 01:03:16.575
Thank you.

01:03:17.950 --> 01:03:21.367
Then you should send a tribute.
Make a nice impression.

01:03:21.408 --> 01:03:24.283
Let me tell you, never let them
badmouth you at a funeral.

01:03:26.575 --> 01:03:30.117
Miss, I want these roses,
all of them.

01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:31.617
- All of them?
- Yes.

01:03:31.700 --> 01:03:35.658
Make a nice big wreath, hmm?
A card?

01:03:35.742 --> 01:03:38.408
- Just over there.
- Thank you.

01:03:38.450 --> 01:03:40.325
How many are there?

01:03:40.408 --> 01:03:43.075
Six dozen.
Would you like them sent?

01:03:43.117 --> 01:03:46.283
Yeah.
To Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan.

01:03:46.367 --> 01:03:48.575
"Moose Jaw"?

01:03:48.658 --> 01:03:51.242
It's near Medicine Hat.

01:03:55.992 --> 01:03:59.783
"Business prevents my being with
you on this sad occasion. Sally."

01:03:59.867 --> 01:04:01.283
Okay?

01:04:02.075 --> 01:04:05.450
And miss, send flowers...
nice ones...

01:04:05.533 --> 01:04:08.575
"To Dave from Lou and the boys
in Atlantic City."

01:04:08.658 --> 01:04:10.325
- You got that?
- Yes.

01:04:10.408 --> 01:04:11.992
Keep the change.

01:04:12.075 --> 01:04:14.533
- Thank you.
- Shall we go?

01:04:14.575 --> 01:04:17.450
This is going to be the biggest
social event in Moose Jaw in years.

01:04:19.992 --> 01:04:22.908
I've got to go.

01:04:22.950 --> 01:04:25.325
- I hope I didn't...
- No, no, no.

01:04:25.408 --> 01:04:28.450
I've got friends waiting.
I should have told you.

01:04:28.533 --> 01:04:32.867
We're fixing up this house
I'm moving to... a new place.

01:04:35.283 --> 01:04:37.283
Can I see you later?

01:04:37.367 --> 01:04:39.825
I've got a class.

01:04:39.908 --> 01:04:41.825
Well, it was a nice lunch.

01:04:41.908 --> 01:04:43.742
Yeah. Thank you.

01:04:46.033 --> 01:04:48.658
- Thanks.
- See you.

01:05:04.658 --> 01:05:07.700
Why did they have to kill him?

01:05:07.783 --> 01:05:09.742
Let's get away from here.

01:05:13.575 --> 01:05:17.325
- Dave was a nice boy.
- He was a shit!

01:05:17.408 --> 01:05:19.533
But you married him.

01:05:19.575 --> 01:05:22.617
Look, you would marry anybody too
to get out of Saskatchewan.

01:05:23.992 --> 01:05:25.867
Don't be mad at me.

01:05:31.033 --> 01:05:34.242
I'm sorry.
I'm not mad at you.

01:05:34.325 --> 01:05:37.075
It's just...

01:05:37.158 --> 01:05:38.867
I'm late and everything.

01:05:38.950 --> 01:05:41.367
You want to go to your friends?
Come on, I'll take you.

01:05:46.867 --> 01:05:49.658
Okay, stop right here.
This is the place.

01:05:49.742 --> 01:05:52.075
See that kid on the roof?
He's in my class.

01:05:53.575 --> 01:05:55.242
Come on in.

01:05:57.075 --> 01:05:59.033
- Hi, Sally.
- I know I'm late.

01:06:02.242 --> 01:06:04.783
Bernie?
I'm sorry I'm late, really.

01:06:04.867 --> 01:06:07.825
I know I'm over two hours late.
Forgive me, okay?

01:06:07.908 --> 01:06:11.742
Lou, Bernie. Bernie, Lou.

01:06:11.825 --> 01:06:14.867
Come see my room.
It's great.

01:06:17.575 --> 01:06:19.533
This Bernie...
you living with him?

01:06:19.575 --> 01:06:23.242
There's ten of us living here.
We're all dealers, would-be dealers.

01:06:23.325 --> 01:06:27.533
- Bernie's baccarat.
- Fancy game with the shoe, huh?

01:06:27.575 --> 01:06:30.242
- Very elegant, Bernie.
- I'm elegant too.

01:06:32.408 --> 01:06:34.450
Oh, that's Agnes.
She's roulette.

01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:47.075
You learn never to split a ten.
A ten is dynamite with a two card...

01:06:47.158 --> 01:06:50.325
but after that
it can be your tragic flaw.

01:06:50.408 --> 01:06:52.867
But it's not just
dealing the cards.

01:06:52.950 --> 01:06:57.450
You have to know how to surrender
and how to wash the deck...

01:06:57.533 --> 01:07:02.242
when to burn it, how to pluck chips,
share the box, stuff like that.

01:07:02.325 --> 01:07:05.033
- When do you take your test?
- Three weeks.

01:07:05.075 --> 01:07:08.200
- I'll be making $20,000 a year.
- No kidding.

01:07:08.242 --> 01:07:10.700
Yeah. 30,000 with tips
if I'm really good.

01:07:10.742 --> 01:07:13.700
Hey. I'm gonna hang on to you.

01:07:14.783 --> 01:07:16.242
Be a gigolo.

01:07:18.283 --> 01:07:20.200
What about Grace?

01:07:21.367 --> 01:07:23.908
She came down here during the war...
beauty contest.

01:07:23.992 --> 01:07:25.950
Oh, for Miss America?

01:07:26.033 --> 01:07:31.033
Nothing like that.
More like Miss Pinball Machine.

01:07:31.117 --> 01:07:34.575
She came, she needed protection.
I protected her.

01:07:34.658 --> 01:07:36.825
She was this teenager.

01:07:36.908 --> 01:07:39.283
You protected her for 40 years?

01:07:39.367 --> 01:07:41.367
Well, she got married
along the way...

01:07:41.408 --> 01:07:44.033
Cookie Pinza.

01:07:44.075 --> 01:07:46.408
But I don't want
to talk about Grace.

01:07:52.867 --> 01:07:55.158
Do you love her?

01:07:55.242 --> 01:07:57.117
I watch you.

01:07:59.033 --> 01:08:02.033
The place where we live...
I watch you.

01:08:03.908 --> 01:08:06.408
- Through my window?
- You saw me?

01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:10.742
I figured maybe
somebody was there.

01:08:10.825 --> 01:08:12.533
Did you know it was me?

01:08:12.575 --> 01:08:17.367
You were just this guy
across the way.

01:08:17.408 --> 01:08:19.242
Why do you use lemons?

01:08:22.408 --> 01:08:25.033
The fish smell.
I'm embarrassed.

01:08:26.575 --> 01:08:29.950
I thought maybe it was for some
other reasons I didn't understand.

01:08:31.242 --> 01:08:35.492
I even went to a supermarket
to look at lemons.

01:08:37.242 --> 01:08:40.867
It's just to get the smell off.
It's nothing weird.

01:08:46.533 --> 01:08:49.783
What do you do
when you watch me?

01:08:49.867 --> 01:08:51.783
I look at you.

01:08:51.867 --> 01:08:56.367
You take off your blouse,
then you run the water.

01:08:56.408 --> 01:09:00.242
Then you take a bottle of gold
perfume and put it on the sink.

01:09:01.742 --> 01:09:04.700
Then you slice the lemons.

01:09:04.742 --> 01:09:07.408
You open a box of blue soap.

01:09:08.492 --> 01:09:11.700
You run your hands under the water
to feel the temperature.

01:09:13.533 --> 01:09:16.533
Then you take the soap
in your hands and...

01:10:46.742 --> 01:10:49.158
Are you Dave Matthews' wife?

01:10:49.242 --> 01:10:52.200
Look, are you a cop? I told you guys
I don't know anything about him.

01:10:52.242 --> 01:10:54.992
- Let's have a look in the bag.
- What are you talking about?

01:10:55.075 --> 01:10:58.242
- The lady said...
- Let go of him!

01:11:02.533 --> 01:11:05.408
Hey, you. Relax, old man.

01:11:05.492 --> 01:11:07.742
This is none of your business.
You don't want to get hurt.

01:12:01.492 --> 01:12:03.408
Are you all right?

01:12:13.992 --> 01:12:16.658
Maybe you should go lie down.

01:12:19.742 --> 01:12:21.867
I don't wanna lie down.

01:12:25.742 --> 01:12:27.867
I didn't protect you.

01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:36.158
Where the hell have you been?
Men were tearing the place apart.

01:12:36.242 --> 01:12:38.575
You go out,
you don't even tell me you're going.

01:12:40.575 --> 01:12:42.533
You okay?

01:12:43.742 --> 01:12:46.283
What the hell are you wearing?

01:12:47.283 --> 01:12:49.742
That girl buying your clothes now?

01:12:49.783 --> 01:12:53.700
Miss, I warn you,
stay away from him.

01:12:54.783 --> 01:12:56.742
Oh, Christ.

01:12:56.783 --> 01:12:59.575
- Did he let that happen to you?
- I'm all right.

01:12:59.658 --> 01:13:01.617
You shut up, Grace,
you goddamned old lady.

01:13:01.700 --> 01:13:05.367
If I'm an old lady,
what does that make you?

01:13:05.408 --> 01:13:08.033
I'm her lover!

01:13:08.075 --> 01:13:11.617
You wanna know his nickname
in the old days? "Numb Nuts."

01:13:15.867 --> 01:13:19.367
Men had names like "Legs"
and "Bullets" and "Cookie."

01:13:19.450 --> 01:13:22.033
His was "Numb Nuts"!

01:13:24.742 --> 01:13:26.367
Lou, open this door.

01:13:26.408 --> 01:13:30.658
- I know you're hiding in there.
- Chrissie? Chrissie!

01:13:30.742 --> 01:13:34.450
- Oh, my God.
- You didn't protect her.

01:13:34.533 --> 01:13:36.658
What's your life worth?

01:13:36.742 --> 01:13:39.325
Cookie had more manhood
in his toupee...

01:13:39.408 --> 01:13:41.867
than you've got in your fat frame.

01:13:43.325 --> 01:13:45.242
Open this door!

01:13:57.617 --> 01:14:00.075
Chrissie, are you okay?

01:14:00.158 --> 01:14:02.242
Chrissie, look.
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

01:14:02.325 --> 01:14:05.950
It's me. Chrissie. Okay, look.
It's gonna be okay.

01:14:07.992 --> 01:14:12.283
Lou, open the door, please.
I'm sorry.

01:14:12.367 --> 01:14:14.325
You're a wonderful man.

01:14:14.408 --> 01:14:18.075
Sometimes I forget to tell you
how much I love you.

01:14:21.950 --> 01:14:24.783
Chrissie, listen to me.
You're all right. You're okay.

01:14:24.867 --> 01:14:27.367
Just take it easy.
You're going to be fine.

01:14:27.408 --> 01:14:28.908
You're all right.
That's it. Come on.

01:14:28.992 --> 01:14:32.492
- Oh, my God.
- Why didn't you call the police?

01:14:32.575 --> 01:14:35.992
My husband, Cookie Pinza,
said never call the police.

01:15:29.825 --> 01:15:32.700
Honey, it's not the first time,
let me tell you.

01:15:32.742 --> 01:15:35.575
When a bad element from New York
had my husband killed...

01:15:35.658 --> 01:15:38.575
on the boardwalk,
Lou ran away.

01:15:38.658 --> 01:15:42.533
He ran away then...

01:15:42.575 --> 01:15:44.533
so he runs away now.

01:15:47.033 --> 01:15:48.825
What did they want?

01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:53.450
What are they looking for?

01:15:53.533 --> 01:15:56.867
- Why did you come here?
- To see you.

01:15:56.908 --> 01:15:59.992
- Don't give me that shit.
- She's a good girl!

01:16:00.075 --> 01:16:02.075
Why did you come here?

01:16:03.908 --> 01:16:07.617
To sell some dope.
We needed money for the baby.

01:16:09.908 --> 01:16:13.575
There's nothing wrong with dope.
Dope belongs to the whole world.

01:16:15.992 --> 01:16:18.408
Where did he get it?

01:16:18.492 --> 01:16:20.992
Some people told us
about a drop in Philadelphia.

01:16:21.075 --> 01:16:23.367
Philadelphia's a nice place.

01:16:23.408 --> 01:16:25.867
What did he do with the money?

01:16:25.908 --> 01:16:28.117
I don't know where the money is.

01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:30.367
He went out with that old man.

01:16:32.242 --> 01:16:35.450
- Dave went out with Lou?
- They took my scale.

01:16:40.325 --> 01:16:42.325
Hey, I want to talk to...

01:17:11.367 --> 01:17:13.158
Hey, Pops, what...

01:17:13.242 --> 01:17:17.033
This is the last batch.
Five G's. Take it or leave it.

01:17:20.075 --> 01:17:23.742
Pops, I'm a little tapped right now.
I can give you four G's...

01:17:23.825 --> 01:17:25.742
give you the rest later,
all right?

01:17:31.617 --> 01:17:32.950
I'll take it.

01:17:37.242 --> 01:17:39.242
Call Fred at the Club Harlem.

01:17:39.325 --> 01:17:41.742
Tell him you're dealing
with Lou Paschall... that's me.

01:17:41.825 --> 01:17:44.783
Tell him to tell those hoods
to leave the women alone.

01:17:44.867 --> 01:17:47.033
What they're looking for,
I got.

01:17:55.575 --> 01:17:58.783
Lou, I'm gettin' compliments
on the suit, Lou.

01:17:58.867 --> 01:18:01.075
You look sharp, Buddy,
real sharp.

01:18:19.158 --> 01:18:22.825
In three weeks,
you'll become dealers...

01:18:24.242 --> 01:18:26.450
and you'll learn a painful truth:

01:18:26.533 --> 01:18:28.575
Everybody hates you.

01:18:30.283 --> 01:18:32.283
You stand in the way
of a million dollars...

01:18:32.367 --> 01:18:34.867
the player hates you.

01:18:34.908 --> 01:18:38.575
You know enough to cheat
the casino... the casino hates you.

01:18:38.658 --> 01:18:43.533
The TV camera over your head
tapes your every move...

01:18:43.575 --> 01:18:46.283
and yet you are alone.

01:18:46.367 --> 01:18:49.242
The players, the floor manager...

01:18:49.283 --> 01:18:52.617
the eye in the sky...
they all watch you.

01:18:55.867 --> 01:18:57.533
You're alone.

01:19:00.867 --> 01:19:03.200
Mr. Shapiro wants to see you.

01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:07.325
Mrs. Matthews, how you doin'?

01:19:08.450 --> 01:19:10.617
Come on in.

01:19:10.700 --> 01:19:12.825
Come on.

01:19:12.908 --> 01:19:14.783
How are ya?

01:19:14.867 --> 01:19:17.367
Sit here. Go on.

01:19:19.242 --> 01:19:22.117
Your husband had a record.

01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:24.408
I hadn't seen or spoken to him
in eight months.

01:19:24.450 --> 01:19:28.450
I know that, and I understand that,
and this is very unfair, but he...

01:19:28.533 --> 01:19:30.742
I don't even know why he was here.

01:19:30.825 --> 01:19:33.783
I know that, and you know that,
but they don't know that.

01:19:33.867 --> 01:19:35.658
- "They"?
- The SEC...

01:19:35.742 --> 01:19:38.575
the Gambling Commission,
the tax people... they don't know it.

01:19:40.617 --> 01:19:45.533
We just can't afford to have people
with your connections working here.

01:19:45.575 --> 01:19:48.408
I'm gonna tell you something.
I feel you have misled us, Sally.

01:19:48.492 --> 01:19:50.408
Sally, right?

01:19:50.492 --> 01:19:53.742
Mr. Shapiro, please. I've only got
three weeks of class left, I need...

01:19:53.825 --> 01:19:57.950
Look, I am entirely on your side
in this situation...

01:19:58.033 --> 01:20:00.950
but this is a very important job...

01:20:01.033 --> 01:20:04.033
and I feel that I just have
to let you go.

01:20:05.075 --> 01:20:06.658
I'm sorry.

01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:10.742
Would it have made any difference
if we hadn't been married?

01:20:10.825 --> 01:20:12.783
Marriage is not the point here.

01:20:12.867 --> 01:20:16.700
We have to be very careful
of our people and who they know.

01:20:16.742 --> 01:20:21.950
If this guy loved you, he would have
shown up sooner or later. You know?

01:20:22.033 --> 01:20:24.242
So love is the point here.

01:20:25.075 --> 01:20:26.908
Yeah.

01:20:32.158 --> 01:20:33.992
- They fired me.
- What?

01:20:34.075 --> 01:20:36.867
Six weeks of classes down the tubes,
just like that.

01:20:37.950 --> 01:20:41.658
- Can you loan me 50 bucks?
- I don't have it.

01:20:41.742 --> 01:20:43.492
I thought we were friends.

01:20:43.575 --> 01:20:48.325
Listen, I saw your sugar daddy
down there at the tables.

01:20:50.575 --> 01:20:53.617
- Really?
- Borrow from friends with bucks.

01:21:01.117 --> 01:21:02.408
Twenty.

01:21:04.408 --> 01:21:05.825
Push.

01:21:11.408 --> 01:21:16.158
Can we talk to you?
I really think we should talk.

01:21:16.242 --> 01:21:18.825
Sir, please don't bother
the players.

01:21:23.867 --> 01:21:27.033
You're selling something
I believe belongs to us.

01:21:27.075 --> 01:21:30.200
I'd like return of the item and
the money you received for the item.

01:21:30.283 --> 01:21:32.450
Hey, man, there's
a game going on here.

01:21:32.533 --> 01:21:36.533
And I'd like to know
how the connections were made.

01:21:36.617 --> 01:21:40.658
Kid got my name in Vegas.
Harry Gropke sent him to me.

01:21:40.742 --> 01:21:43.575
When you come to Atlantic City,
I'm the man to see.

01:21:43.658 --> 01:21:47.283
Come on. We know who you are.
You're nothing, mister.

01:21:47.367 --> 01:21:49.700
Hey, there's a game
going on here.

01:21:49.742 --> 01:21:52.658
Sir, you can't disturb
the players.

01:21:52.742 --> 01:21:54.658
I think we should
continue this outside.

01:21:54.742 --> 01:21:56.825
- No.
- Let's go.

01:22:07.242 --> 01:22:09.408
You're playing with Dave's money.
I'm owed it.

01:22:09.492 --> 01:22:11.908
Madam, please. If you're not playing
you'll have to leave the table.

01:22:11.992 --> 01:22:14.742
- Sit down and be quiet.
- You're buying me roses.

01:22:14.825 --> 01:22:17.867
I'm fired from my job, I'm supposed
to sit here like some Vegas bimbo.

01:22:17.908 --> 01:22:19.950
Mister, I got hoods
beating the shit out of me.

01:22:20.033 --> 01:22:22.908
If I'm beat up for money and drugs,
I want the money and drugs on me.

01:22:24.908 --> 01:22:26.742
Don't touch the suit.

01:22:26.825 --> 01:22:30.367
- You're like Dave gone senile.
- Madam, you'll have to go.

01:22:30.450 --> 01:22:34.492
- Look, I trusted you.
- I'll take care of her.

01:22:34.575 --> 01:22:37.158
Look, he took my money.
Make him give me back my money!

01:22:37.242 --> 01:22:39.450
But I want my money!

01:22:39.533 --> 01:22:41.450
You see that man over there?

01:22:41.533 --> 01:22:43.617
- Where?
- In the blue suit?

01:22:43.700 --> 01:22:48.158
- So?
- He only wants a blonde next to him.

01:22:48.242 --> 01:22:49.825
What do you mean?

01:22:49.908 --> 01:22:52.242
No, strictly for luck.
Nothing will happen.

01:22:52.325 --> 01:22:55.242
If he loses, he'll be
too depressed to do anything.

01:22:55.325 --> 01:22:58.242
If he wins,
he'll just talk about it.

01:23:02.908 --> 01:23:04.367
- You pimp!
- What?

01:23:04.408 --> 01:23:06.408
- What do you think I am?
- I was trying to help you!

01:23:06.492 --> 01:23:09.200
Help me? You're trying to whore me.
Get your hands off me.

01:23:09.242 --> 01:23:11.700
- You'll have to leave the casino.
- Leave me alone!

01:23:11.742 --> 01:23:14.117
If you're gonna arrest somebody,
arrest that guy down there.

01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:16.492
He's the one pushing drugs.
Leave me alone!

01:23:16.575 --> 01:23:18.575
Somebody get my money back.
That guy took my money.

01:23:18.658 --> 01:23:22.658
Let go of me!
Get me my money back!

01:23:22.742 --> 01:23:24.658
This woman is not allowed
in the casino.

01:23:24.742 --> 01:23:26.867
I don't want to be in the casino.
I want my money.

01:23:26.908 --> 01:23:29.367
You let these punks in here,
you won't let me in here?

01:23:29.408 --> 01:23:32.992
This guy beat me up.
He wrecked my house. Let go of me!

01:23:33.075 --> 01:23:35.075
- Come on!
- I'm very, very sorry, sir.

01:23:35.158 --> 01:23:37.283
This woman has just been fired.
She's very upset.

01:23:37.367 --> 01:23:40.575
On behalf of the hotel,
I'd like to give you reservations...

01:23:40.658 --> 01:23:44.867
for the Camelot Room,
also the Superstar Room.

01:23:45.742 --> 01:23:48.867
Get your hands off of me!
Let go of me!

01:23:48.908 --> 01:23:51.117
Let go!
I can walk out by myself.

01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:55.158
Get your hands off of me!
Will you get your hands...

01:23:55.242 --> 01:23:58.450
Let go of me!
Let go!

01:24:00.158 --> 01:24:04.450
Let go! Are you happy?
Okay? I'm out!

01:24:07.242 --> 01:24:08.658
Shit!

01:24:15.242 --> 01:24:17.700
Hey, stop! Wait!

01:24:21.492 --> 01:24:23.617
Where did he just go?

01:24:25.117 --> 01:24:26.575
Thank you.

01:24:52.533 --> 01:24:54.533
I need your help.

01:24:54.575 --> 01:24:58.075
My father, he's escaped.

01:24:58.158 --> 01:25:02.492
He's on your bus. He's the old guy
with the white hat and trench coat.

01:25:02.575 --> 01:25:06.117
- He's not right in the head.
- What do you want me to do?

01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:09.700
Could you please get him off
the bus? He needs his medication.

01:25:09.783 --> 01:25:12.200
- Yeah. Leave it to me.
- Thank you.

01:25:15.325 --> 01:25:19.075
We made a little mistake.
We've oversold the bus.

01:25:19.158 --> 01:25:22.117
So one of you is gonna have
to get off.

01:25:23.575 --> 01:25:25.867
You were the last person
to buy a ticket, sir.

01:25:25.908 --> 01:25:28.908
- Come on, old man. Come on, sir.
- What?

01:25:28.950 --> 01:25:32.075
We've oversold the bus, sir.
I'm afraid you have to get off.

01:25:32.158 --> 01:25:34.408
You got plenty of seats.

01:25:34.450 --> 01:25:37.283
Yeah, but they're reserved.
I'm sorry. Come on, sir.

01:25:37.367 --> 01:25:38.783
Jeez, I mean...

01:25:38.867 --> 01:25:41.117
- We got a schedule, sir.
- Is there another bus?

01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:44.283
There's another bus coming
right behind, sir.

01:25:44.367 --> 01:25:48.867
Can't hold up all these people.
That's it. Come on, sir.

01:25:48.908 --> 01:25:51.533
- Your daughter will care for you.
- I got no daughter.

01:25:51.575 --> 01:25:54.908
- Let's not be naughty.
- Come on, Pops.

01:25:54.950 --> 01:25:57.117
This woman is not my daughter.

01:25:57.200 --> 01:26:01.200
I talked to Jimmy and the kids.
You can have your own room and TV.

01:26:01.283 --> 01:26:05.367
And Jimmy won't play his stereo loud
if you won't smoke in the closet.

01:26:06.658 --> 01:26:08.700
I made love to this woman today.

01:26:08.742 --> 01:26:10.283
Daddy, please!

01:26:10.367 --> 01:26:13.367
I held her in my arms,
and I made her happy.

01:26:13.450 --> 01:26:15.408
- Let's not be naughty.
- It's gonna be okay.

01:26:15.450 --> 01:26:18.200
It's gonna be all right.
We'll take good care of him.

01:26:18.242 --> 01:26:21.825
I'm dangerous!
People come to me from Las Vegas.

01:26:21.908 --> 01:26:24.700
I know Bugsy Siegel.
I was his cellmate.

01:26:25.742 --> 01:26:28.367
I want that money.
It belongs to me.

01:26:30.492 --> 01:26:33.783
You have money. I've seen it.
Don't give me that shit.

01:26:33.867 --> 01:26:37.242
- Listen, I don't have it.
- Give it to me.

01:26:47.075 --> 01:26:48.992
Hey, old man.

01:26:54.367 --> 01:26:56.367
Hey, foxy grandpa.

01:26:56.408 --> 01:27:00.908
It's over now. I want the money.
You know what I'm talking about.

01:27:00.992 --> 01:27:02.742
Give me the money.

01:27:02.825 --> 01:27:06.283
Give me the money now.

01:27:06.367 --> 01:27:07.867
You bitch!

01:27:07.950 --> 01:27:11.658
You slapped me! You slapped me,
you stupid bitch!

01:27:11.742 --> 01:27:14.283
The money. Money, money!

01:27:40.033 --> 01:27:42.200
Come on, get outta here.

01:27:43.908 --> 01:27:46.117
Get in the car!

01:28:14.992 --> 01:28:16.908
I can't believe I did it.

01:28:16.992 --> 01:28:19.033
Am I bleeding?
Did he cut me?

01:28:19.075 --> 01:28:24.242
I can't believe I did it. I really
did it! Did you see me do it?

01:28:24.325 --> 01:28:25.908
I'm all right.

01:28:25.992 --> 01:28:29.408
When I saw that knife on you,
I pulled the trigger. Bam, bam!

01:28:29.450 --> 01:28:32.575
- Did you see the look on his face?
- Get rid of that gun.

01:28:32.658 --> 01:28:37.408
- I protected you.
- Stop pointing... Get rid of it.

01:28:47.242 --> 01:28:50.575
- How much?
- A quarter. Can't you read?

01:28:50.658 --> 01:28:54.783
Lady, it's the first time I've been
out of Atlantic City in 20 years.

01:28:56.700 --> 01:28:58.700
A thousand dollar bill?

01:28:58.742 --> 01:29:00.367
I'm sorry.

01:29:01.742 --> 01:29:03.992
- Here.
- Here's a hundred.

01:29:05.075 --> 01:29:06.992
I'll lend you the quarter.

01:29:07.075 --> 01:29:08.867
Thank you, madam.

01:29:21.700 --> 01:29:23.825
A room for me and my mother.

01:29:23.908 --> 01:29:27.033
And we want some drinks.
Bourbon, Coke.

01:29:28.283 --> 01:29:32.867
No, wait. Make that champagne,
peanuts, crackers.

01:29:32.950 --> 01:29:35.158
The expensive kind.
The French kind.

01:29:36.242 --> 01:29:37.658
Got it?

01:29:42.450 --> 01:29:45.992
<i>It's time for all the news

<i>We'll have more from Atlantic City

01:31:06.325 --> 01:31:08.575
Is this the stomach?

01:31:08.617 --> 01:31:10.950
Is this the baby?

01:31:11.033 --> 01:31:12.742
It feels nice.

01:31:15.408 --> 01:31:18.367
I came here during the war.

01:31:18.450 --> 01:31:21.242
Betty Grable look-alike contest.

01:31:21.283 --> 01:31:26.242
The boardwalk filled with hundreds
of Betty Grable look-alikes...

01:31:26.325 --> 01:31:29.908
from all over America
selling war bonds.

01:31:32.617 --> 01:31:36.492
<i>On the boardwalk
in Atlantic City</i>

01:31:36.575 --> 01:31:39.783
<i>Life will be peaches and cream</i>

01:31:39.867 --> 01:31:42.658
You never went back home?

01:31:42.742 --> 01:31:45.867
I met some boys. Lou.

01:31:45.950 --> 01:31:50.117
Cookie Pinza,
who I later married.

01:31:50.200 --> 01:31:52.908
Atlantic City became my home.

01:31:57.908 --> 01:32:00.658
You oughta fly home.

01:32:02.283 --> 01:32:04.742
I'll treat you to the ticket.

01:32:06.325 --> 01:32:07.908
You will?

01:32:09.533 --> 01:32:12.200
If you can get a seat belt
around that.

01:32:13.283 --> 01:32:16.867
I never use seat belts.
I don't believe in gravity.

01:32:19.283 --> 01:32:22.742
We both lost our men
through a shooting.

01:32:22.825 --> 01:32:24.908
I don't mind that Dave's dead.

01:32:24.992 --> 01:32:28.575
It just means he'll be
reincarnated sooner, that's all.

01:32:30.158 --> 01:32:32.992
You mean Cookie's coming back?

01:32:33.075 --> 01:32:35.992
Sure! Everything comes back.

01:32:38.950 --> 01:32:41.533
You know,
you look after people good.

01:32:44.408 --> 01:32:47.533
I never had to look after anybody.

01:32:49.033 --> 01:32:52.033
I was a princess!

01:33:07.200 --> 01:33:10.075
I like that...
making the news.

01:33:18.950 --> 01:33:21.492
Who was Bugsy Siegel?

01:33:24.325 --> 01:33:26.492
The meanest, the coldest.

01:33:26.575 --> 01:33:30.075
- And he was your cellmate?
- I gotta be honest.

01:33:30.158 --> 01:33:32.367
- I was in the slammer on a D & D.
- What's that?

01:33:32.408 --> 01:33:34.408
D & D. Drunk and disorderly.

01:33:34.450 --> 01:33:37.867
They brought Bugsy in for ten
minutes on the way to Leavenworth.

01:33:37.908 --> 01:33:40.575
Man, was he pissed off.

01:33:40.658 --> 01:33:42.658
He didn't even know me.

01:33:43.742 --> 01:33:45.742
And that's all?

01:33:49.117 --> 01:33:51.867
I never killed anybody in my life.

01:33:53.325 --> 01:33:55.992
I never thought you did.

01:33:56.075 --> 01:33:58.825
But I did tonight.
You saw it.

01:34:00.200 --> 01:34:02.200
Yeah, I saw it.

01:34:07.533 --> 01:34:09.283
Some champagne?

01:34:15.575 --> 01:34:18.908
You got all those young guys.
Bernie.

01:34:21.117 --> 01:34:23.908
